      "content": "Beirut (  bay-ROOT; Arabic: بيروت, romanized: ) is the capital and largest city of Lebanon. As of 2014, Greater Beirut has a population of 2.5 million, just under half of Lebanon's population, which makes it the twelfth-largest city in the Levant region and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world. The city is situated on a peninsula at the midpoint of Lebanon's Mediterranean coast. Beirut has been inhabited for more than 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world.\nBeirut is Lebanon's seat of government and plays a central role in the Lebanese economy, with many banks and corporations based in the city. Beirut is an important seaport for the country and region, and rated a Beta- World City by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Beirut was severely damaged by the Lebanese Civil War, the 2006 Lebanon War, and the 2020 massive explosion in the Port of Beirut, and was subsequently rebuilt after each of these events. Its architectural and demographic structure underwent major change in recent decades.\n\nEtymology\nThe English name Beirut is an early transcription of the Arabic name Bayrūt (بيروت). The same name's transcription into French is Beyrouth, which was sometimes used during Lebanon's French mandate. The Arabic name derives from Phoenician bēʾrūt (𐤁𐤀‏𐤓𐤕‎ bʾrt). This was a modification of the Phoenician word bīʾrōt later bēʾrūt, meaning \"wells\", in reference to the site's accessible water table. The name is first attested in the 14th century BC, when it was mentioned in three Akkadian cuneiform tablets of the Amarna letters, letters sent by King Ammunira of Biruta to Amenhotep III or Amenhotep IV of Egypt. Biruta was also mentioned in the Amarna letters from King Rib-Hadda of Byblos.\nThe Greeks hellenised the name as Bērytós (Ancient Greek: Βηρυτός), which the Romans latinised as Berytus. When it attained the status of a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and its official name was emended to Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus to include its imperial sponsors.\nAt the time of the crusades, the city was known in French as Barut or Baruth.\n\nHistory\nThe earliest settlement of Beirut was on an island in the Beirut River, but the channel that separated it from the banks silted up and the island ceased to be. Excavations in the downtown area have unearthed layers of Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Crusader, Persian and Ottoman remains.\n\nPrehistory\nBeirut was settled over 5,000 years ago, and there is evidence that the surrounding area had already been inhabited for tens of thousands of years prior to this. Several prehistoric archaeological sites have been discovered within the urban area of Beirut, revealing flint tools from sequential periods dating from the Middle Palaeolithic and Upper Paleolithic through the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.\nBeirut I (Minet el-Hosn) was listed as \"the town of Beirut\" (French: Beyrouth ville) by Louis Burkhalter and said to be on the beach near the Orient and Bassoul hotels on the Avenue des Français in central Beirut. The site was discovered by Lortet in 1894 and discussed by Godefroy Zumoffen in 1900. The flint industry from the site was described as Mousterian and is held by the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon.\nBeirut II (Umm el-Khatib) was suggested by Burkhalter to have been south of Tarik el Jedideh, where P.E. Gigues discovered a Copper Age flint industry at around 100 metres (328 feet) above sea level. The site had been built on and destroyed by 1948.\nBeirut III (Furn esh-Shebbak), listed as Plateau Tabet, was suggested to have been located on the left bank of the Beirut River. Burkhalter suggested that it was west of the Damascus road, although this determination has been criticized by Lorraine Copeland. P. E. Gigues discovered a series of Neolithic flint tools on the surface along with the remains of a structure suggested to be a hut circle. Auguste Bergy discussed polished axes that were also found at this site, which has now completely disappeared as a result of construction and urbanization of the area.\nBeirut IV (Furn esh-Shebbak, river banks) was also on the left bank of the river and on either side of the road leading eastwards from the Furn esh Shebbak police station towards the river that marked the city limits. The area was covered in red sand that represented Quaternary river terraces. The site was found by Jesuit Father Dillenseger and published by fellow Jesuits Godefroy Zumoffen, Raoul Describes and Auguste Bergy. Collections from the site were made by Bergy, Describes and another Jesuit, Paul Bovier-Lapierre. Many Middle Paleolithic flint tools were found on the surface and in side gullies that drain into the river. They included around 50 varied bifaces accredited to the Acheulean period, some with a lustrous sheen, now held at the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. Henri Fleisch also found an Emireh point amongst material from the site, which has now disappeared beneath buildings.\nBeirut V (Nahr Beirut, Beirut River) was discovered by Dillenseger and said to be in an orchard of mulberry trees on the left bank of the river, near the river mouth, and to be close to the railway station and bridge to Tripoli. Levallois flints and bones and similar surface material were found amongst brecciated deposits. The area has now been built on.\nBeirut VI (Patriarchate) was a site discovered while building on the property of the Lebanese Evangelical School for Girls in the Patriarchate area of Beirut. It was notable for the discovery of a finely styled Canaanean blade javelin suggested to date to the early or middle Neolithic periods of Byblos and which is held in the school library.\nBeirut VII, the Rivoli Cinema and Byblos Cinema sites near the Bourj in the Rue el Arz area, are two sites discovered by Lorraine Copeland, Peter Wescombe, and Marina Hayek in 1964 and examined by Diana Kirkbride and Roger Saidah. One site was behind the parking lot of the Byblos Cinema and showed collapsed walls, pits, floors, charcoal, pottery and flints. The other, overlooking a cliff west of the Rivoli Cinema, was composed of three layers resting on limestone bedrock. Fragments of blades and broad flakes were recovered from the first layer of black soil, above which some Bronze Age pottery was recovered in a layer of grey soil. Pieces of Roman pottery and mosaics were found in the upper layer. Middle Bronze Age tombs were found in this area, and the ancient tell of Beirut is thought to be in the Bourj area.\n\nPhoenician period\nThe Phoenician port of Beirut was located between Rue Foch and Rue Allenby on the north coast. The port or harbour was excavated and reported on several years ago and now lies buried under the city. Another suggested port or dry dock was claimed to have been discovered around 1 kilometre (0.62 miles) to the west in 2011 by a team of Lebanese archaeologists from the Directorate General of Antiquities of Lebanese University. Controversy arose on 26 June 2012 when authorization was given by Lebanese Minister of Culture Gaby Layoun for a private company called Venus Towers Real Estate Development Company to destroy the ruins (archaeological site BEY194) in the $500 million construction project of three skyscrapers and a garden behind Hotel Monroe in downtown Beirut. Two later reports by an international committee of archaeologists appointed by Layoun, including Hanz Curver, and an expert report by Ralph Pederson, a member of the institute of Nautical Archaeology and now teaching in Marburg, Germany, dismissed the claims that the trenches were a port, on various criteria. The exact function of site BEY194 may never be known, and the issue raised heated emotions and led to increased coverage on the subject of Lebanese heritage in the press.\n\nHellenistic period\nIn 140 BC, the Phoenician city was destroyed by Diodotus Tryphon during his conflict with Antiochus VII Sidetes for the throne of the Hellenistic Seleucid monarchy. Laodicea in Phoenicia was built upon the same site on a more conventional Hellenistic plan. Present-day Beirut overlies this ancient one, and little archaeology was carried out until after the civil war in 1991. The salvage excavations after 1993 have yielded new insights into the layout and history of this period of Beirut's history. Public architecture included several areas and buildings.\nMid-1st-century coins from Berytus bear the head of Tyche, goddess of fortune; on the reverse, the city's symbol appears: a dolphin entwines an anchor. This symbol was later taken up by the early printer Aldus Manutius in 15th century Venice. After a state of civil war and decline the Seleucid Empire faced, King Tigranes the Great of the Kingdom of Armenia conquered Beirut and placed it under effective Armenian control. However, after the Battle of Tigranocerta, Armenia forever lost their holdings in Syria and Beirut was conquered by Roman general Pompey.\n\nRoman period\nLaodicea was conquered by Pompey in 64 BC and the name Berytus was restored to it. The city was assimilated into the Roman Empire, soldiers were sent there, and large building projects were undertaken. From the 1st century BC, the Bekaa Valley served as a source of grain for the Roman provinces of the Levant and even for Rome itself. Under Claudius, Berytus expanded to reach the Bekaa Valley and include Heliopolis (Baalbek). The city was settled by Roman colonists who promoted agriculture in the region.\nAs a result of this settlement, the city quickly became Romanized, and the city became the only mainly Latin-speaking area in the Syria-Phoenicia province. In 14 BC, during the reign of Herod the Great, Berytus became a colony, one of four in the Syria-Phoenicia region and the only one with full Italian rights (ius Italicum) exempting its citizens from imperial taxation. Beirut was considered the most Roman city in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the veterans of two Roman legions were established in the city of Berytus by emperor Augustus: the 5th Macedonian and the 3rd Gallic Legions.\nBerytus's law school was widely known; two of Rome's most famous jurists, Papinian and Ulpian, were natives of Phoenicia and taught there under the Severan emperors. Ecclesiastical historian Sozomen studied at the law school in Beirut between 400 and 402. When Justinian assembled his Pandects in the 6th century, a large part of the corpus of laws was derived from these two jurists, and in AD 533 Justinian recognised the school as one of the three official law schools of the empire.\nIn 551, a major earthquake struck Berytus, causing widespread damage. The earthquake reduced cities along the coast to ruins and killed many, 30,000 in Berytus alone by some measurements. As a result, the students of the law school were transferred to Sidon.\nSalvage excavations since 1993 have yielded new insights in the layout and history of Roman Berytus. Public architecture included several bath complexes, Colonnaded Streets, a circus and theatre; residential areas were excavated in the Garden of Forgiveness, Martyrs' Square and the Beirut Souks.\n\nMiddle Ages\nBeirut was conquered by the Muslims in 635. As a trading center of the eastern Mediterranean, Beirut was as important as Acre (in modern-day Israel) during the Middle Ages. From 1110 to 1291, the town and Lordship of Beirut was part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The city was taken by Saladin in 1187 and recaptured in 1197 by Henry I of Brabant as part of the German Crusade of 1197. John of Ibelin, known as the Old Lord of Beirut, was granted the lordship of the city in 1204. He rebuilt the city after its destruction by the Ayyubids and also built the House of Ibelin palace in Beirut.\n\nIn 1291 Beirut was captured and the Crusaders expelled by the Mamluk army of Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil.\n\nOttoman rule\nUnder the Ottoman sultan Selim I (1512–1520), the Ottomans conquered Syria including present-day Lebanon. Beirut was controlled by local Druze emirs throughout the Ottoman period. One of them, Fakhr-al-Din II, fortified it early in the 17th century, but the Ottomans reclaimed it in 1763. With the help of Damascus, Beirut successfully broke Acre's monopoly on Syrian maritime trade and for a few years supplanted it as the main trading center in the region. During the succeeding epoch of rebellion against Ottoman hegemony in Acre under Jezzar Pasha and Abdullah Pasha, Beirut declined to a small town with a population of about 10,000 and was an object of contention between the Ottomans, the local Druze, and the Mamluks. After Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt captured Acre in 1832, Beirut began its revival.\nAfter the Albanian fighter Tafil Buzi was interned and then pardoned by the Ottoman administration for his constant uprisings, he raised 3,000 Albanian mercenaries to fight in Lebanon; some of them became notorious shortly afterwards for having been responsible for the widespread disorders in Beirut.\n\nBy the second half of the nineteenth century, Beirut was developing close commercial and political ties with European imperial powers, particularly France. European interests in Lebanese silk and other export products transformed the city into a major port and commercial center. This boom in cross-regional trade allowed certain groups, such as the Sursock family, to establish trade and manufacturing empires that further strengthened Beirut's position as a key partner in the interests of imperial dynasties. Meanwhile, Ottoman power in the region continued to decline. Sectarian and religious conflicts, power vacuums, and changes in the political dynamics of the region culminated in the 1860 Lebanon conflict. Beirut became a destination for Maronite Christian refugees fleeing from the worst areas of the fighting on Mount Lebanon and in Damascus. This in turn altered the religious composition of Beirut itself, sowing the seeds of future sectarian and religious troubles there and in greater Lebanon. However, Beirut was able to prosper in the meantime. This was again a product of European intervention, and also a general realization amongst the city's residents that commerce, trade, and prosperity depended on domestic stability. After petitions by the local bourgeois, the governor of Syria Vilayet Mehmed Rashid Pasha authorized the establishment of the Beirut Municipal Council, the first municipality established in the Arab provinces of the Empire. The council was elected by an assembly of city notables and played an instrumental role governing the city through the following decades.\n\nVilayet of Beirut\nIn 1888, Beirut was made capital of a vilayet (governorate) in Syria, including the sanjaks (prefectures) Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut, Acre and Bekaa. By this time, Beirut had grown into a cosmopolitan city and had close links with Europe and the United States. It also became a centre of missionary activity that spawned educational institutions such as the American University of Beirut. Provided with water from a British company and gas from a French one, silk exports to Europe came to dominate the local economy. After French engineers established a modern harbour in 1894 and a rail link across Lebanon to Damascus and Aleppo in 1907, much of the trade was carried by French ships to Marseille. French influence in the area soon exceeded that of any other European power. Though French infrastructure investments in the region were supportive, the local merchant elites were able to independently maintain economic power even after the end of the First World War. In contrast, although Beirut was not the only city to receive French attention in this time, it was able to leverage its critical position to its advantage over others (e.g. Damascus). The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica reported a population consisting of 36,000 Muslims, 77,000 Christians, 2,500 Jews, 400 Druze and 4,100 foreigners. At the start of the 20th century, Salim Ali Salam was one of the most prominent figures in Beirut, holding numerous public positions including deputy from Beirut to the Ottoman parliament and President of the Municipality of Beirut. Given his modern way of life, the emergence of Salim Ali Salam as a public figure constituted a transformation in terms of the social development of the city.\n\nIn his 2003 book entitled Beirut and its Seven Families, Yussef Bin Ahmad Bin Ali Al Husseini says:\nThe seven families of Beirut are the families who bonded among each other and made the famous historical agreement with the governor of the Syrian Coast in 1351 to protect and defend the city of Beirut and its shores, and chase the invaders and stop their progress towards it.\n\nModern era\nCapital of Lebanon\nAfter World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Beirut, along with the rest of Lebanon, was placed under the French Mandate. Lebanon achieved independence in 1943, and Beirut became the capital city. The city remained a regional intellectual capital, becoming a major tourist destination and a banking haven, especially for the Persian Gulf oil boom.\nBeirut International Airport was opened on 23 April 1954. It was renamed Rafic Hariri International Airport in 2005 following his assassination. Beirut serves its sole commercial airport as Lebanon's main gateway for flights.\nThis era of relative prosperity ended in 1975 when the Lebanese Civil War broke out throughout the country. During most of the war, Beirut was divided between the Muslim west part and the Christian east. The downtown area, previously the home of much of the city's commercial and cultural activity, became a no man's land known as the Green Line. Many inhabitants fled to other countries. About 60,000 people died in the first two years of the war (1975–1976), and much of the city was devastated. A particularly destructive period was the 1978 Syrian siege of Achrafiyeh, the main Christian district of Beirut. Syrian troops relentlessly shelled the eastern quarter of the city, but Christian militias defeated multiple attempts by Syria's elite forces to capture the strategic area in a three-month campaign later known as the Hundred Days' War.\n\nAnother destructive chapter was the 1982 Lebanon War, during which most of West Beirut was under siege by Israeli troops. In 1983, French and US barracks were bombed, killing 241 American servicemen, 58 French servicemen, six civilians and the two suicide bombers.\nBetween 1989 and 1990 parts on East Beirut were destroyed in fighting between Lebanese army units loyal to General Aoun and Samir Geagea's Maronite Christian Lebanese Forces with the Syrian Armed Forces-backed Elias Hrawi and Salim Al-Huss Lebanese army forces.\nSince the end of the war in 1990, the people of Lebanon have been rebuilding Beirut, whose urban agglomeration was mainly constituted during war time through an anarchic urban development stretching along the littoral corridor and its nearby heights. By the start of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict the city had somewhat regained its status as a tourist, cultural and intellectual centre in the Middle East and as a center for commerce, fashion, and media. The reconstruction of downtown Beirut has been largely driven by Solidere, a development company established in 1994 by Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. The city has hosted both the Asian Club Basketball Championship and the Asian Football Cup, and has hosted the Miss Europe pageant nine times: 1960–1964, 1999, 2001–2002, and 2016.\nRafic Hariri was assassinated in 2005 near the Saint George Hotel in Beirut. A month later about one million people gathered for an opposition rally in Beirut. The Cedar Revolution was the largest rally in Lebanon's history at that time. The last Syrian troops withdrew from Beirut on 26 April 2005, and the two countries established diplomatic relations on 15 October 2008.\n\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon War, Israeli bombardment caused damage in many parts of Beirut, especially the predominantly Shiite southern suburbs of Beirut. On 12 July 2006, the \"Operation Truthful Promise\" carried out by Hezbollah ended with 8 Israeli deaths and 6 injuries. In response, the IDF targeted Hezbollah's main media outlets. There were then artillery raids against targets in southern Lebanon, and the Israeli cabinet held Beirut responsible for the attacks. Then on 13 July 2006 Israel began implementing a naval and air blockade over Lebanon; during this blockade Israel bombed the runways at Beirut International Airport and the major Beirut-Damascus highway in Eastern Lebanon.\nIn May 2008, after the government decided to disband Hezbollah's communications network (a decision it later rescinded), violent clashes broke out briefly between government allies and opposition forces, before control of the city was handed over to the Lebanese Army. After this a national dialogue conference was held in Doha at the invitation of the Prince of Qatar. The conference agreed to appoint a new president of Lebanon and to establish a new national government involving all the political adversaries. As a result of the Doha Agreement, the opposition's barricades were dismantled and so were the opposition's protest camps in Martyrs' Square. On 19 October 2012, a car bomb killed eight people in the Beirut's neighborhood of Achrafiyeh, including Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan, chief of the Intelligence Bureau of the Internal Security Forces. In addition, 78 others were wounded in the bombing. It was the largest attack in the capital since 2008. On 27 December 2013, a car bomb exploded in the Central District killing at least five people, including the former Lebanese ambassador to the U.S. Mohamad Chatah, and wounding 71 others.\nIn the 12 November 2015 Beirut bombings, two suicide bombers detonated explosives outside a mosque and inside a bakery, killing 43 people and injuring 200. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.\nOn 4 August 2020, a massive explosion in the Port of Beirut resulted in the death of at least 203 people (with an additional three missing) and the wounding of more than 6,500. Foreigners from at least 22 countries were among the casualties. Furthermore, at least 108 Bangladeshis were injured in the blasts, making them the most affected foreign community. The cause of the blast is believed to be from government-confiscated and stored ammonium nitrate. As many as 300,000 people have been left homeless by the explosion. Protesters in Lebanon called on the government on 8 August 2020 for the end of the alleged negligence that resulted in the 4 August explosion. On 10 August 2020, as a result of the protests, Prime Minister Hassan Diab announced his resignation. Weeks later, a huge fire erupted in an oil and tyre warehouse in the port's duty-free zone, on 10 September 2020.\n\nGeography\nBeirut sits on a peninsula extending westward into the Mediterranean Sea. It is flanked by the Lebanon Mountains and has taken on a triangular shape, largely influenced by its situation between and atop two hills: Al-Ashrafieh and Al-Musaytibah. The Beirut Governorate occupies 18 square kilometres (6.9 sq mi), and the city's metropolitan area 67 square kilometres (26 sq mi). The coast is rather diverse, with rocky beaches, sandy shores and cliffs situated beside one another.\n\nClimate\nBeirut has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa, bordering on As, Trewartha: Csal) characterized by mild days and nights, as its coastal location allows temperatures to be moderated by the sea. Autumn and spring are warm, but short. Winter is mild and rainy; frost has never been recorded. Summer is prolonged, hot and humid. The prevailing wind during the afternoon and evening is from the west (onshore, blowing in from the Mediterranean); at night it reverses to offshore, blowing from the land out to sea.\nThe average annual rainfall is 825 millimetres (32.5 in), with the large majority of it falling from October to April. Much of the autumn and spring rain falls in heavy downpours on a limited number of days, but in winter it is spread more evenly over many days. Summer receives very little rainfall, if any. Snow is rare, except in the mountainous eastern suburbs, where snowfall occurs due to the region's high altitudes. Hail (which can often be heavy) occurs a few times per year, mostly during winter.\n\nEnvironmental issues\nLebanon, especially Beirut and its suburbs, suffered a massive garbage crisis, mainly from July 2015 up to March 2016. The issue began when authorities shut down the main landfill site originally used for Beirut's garbage south-east of the city and failed to provide any alternative solutions for months. As a result, garbage mounted in the streets in Greater Beirut and caused protests to erupt, which sometimes invoked police action. This problem was commonly blamed on the country's political situation. This garbage crisis birthed a movement called \"You Stink\" which was directed at the country's politicians. In March 2016, the government came up with a so-called temporary solution to establish two new landfills East and South of the city to store the garbage, while several municipalities across the country, in an unprecedented move, began recycling and managing waste more efficiently, building waste-management facilities and relying on themselves rather than the central government. Moreover, Beirut has a lack of green areas with just two main public gardens (sanayeh and horch Beirut). In fact, concrete roofs cover 80% of the capital area.\n\nQuarters and sectors\nBeirut is divided into 12 quarters (quartiers):\n\nAchrafieh\nDar Mreisse\nBachoura\nMazraa (with the neighbourhood Badaro)\nMedawar (with the neighbourhood Mar Mikhaël)\nMinet El Hosn\nMoussaitbeh (with Ramlet al-Baida)\nPort\nRas Beirut\nRmeil\nSaifi\nZuqaq al-Blat\nThese quarters are divided into 59 sectors (secteurs).\n\nBadaro is an edgy, bohemian style neighborhood, within the green district of Beirut (secteur du parc) which also include the Beirut Hippodrome and the Beirut Pine Forest and the French ambassador's Pine Residence. It is one of Beirut's favorite hip nightlife destination.\nTwo of the twelve official Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon are located in the southern suburbs of Beirut: Bourj el-Barajneh and Shatila. There is also one within its municipal boundaries: Mar Elias.\n\nSouthern suburban districts include Chiyah, Ghobeiry (Bir Hassan, Jnah and Ouzai are part of the Ghobeiry municipality), Haret Hreik, Burj al Barajneh, Laylake-Mreijeh, Hay al Sillum and Hadath. Eastern suburbs include Burj Hammoud, Sin el Fil, Dekwane and Mkalles. Hazmiyeh is also considered as an eastern suburb with its close proximity to the capital. Of the 15 unregistered or unofficial refugee camps, Sabra, which lies adjacent to Shatila, is also located in southern Beirut and was the scene of a massacre during the civil war.\nPeople in Lebanon often use different names for the same geographic locations, and few people rely on official, government-provided street numbers. Instead, historic and commercial landmarks are more commonly used.\n\nDemographics\nNo population census has been taken in Lebanon since 1932, but estimates of Beirut's population range from as low as 938,940 through 1,303,129 to as high as 2,200,000 as part of Greater Beirut.\n\nReligion\nBeirut is one of the most cosmopolitan and religiously diverse cities of Lebanon and all of the Middle East. Before the civil war the neighborhoods of Beirut were fairly heterogeneous, but they became largely segregated by religion since the conflict. East Beirut has a mainly Christian population with a small Muslim minority, whilst West Beirut has a Sunni Muslim majority with small minorities of Shia, Christians and Druze. Since the end of the civil war, East and West Beirut have begun to see an increase in Muslims and Christians moving into each half. Christians comprise 35% of Beirut's population, Muslims 63%, Druze 1%, and others 1%.\n\nFamily matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance are still handled by the religious authorities representing a person's faith (the Ottoman \"millet\" system). Calls for civil marriage are unanimously rejected by the religious authorities, but civil marriages held in another country are recognized by Lebanese civil authorities.\n\nLanguages\nLebanon does not hold a census survey; researchers at the American University of Beirut have found that trilingualism - between Lebanese Arabic, French and English - is common and normal among Beirut residents. The use of all three languages crosses between the city's different sects and geography, and are a common occurrence in both the more cosmopolitan and the more conservative neighborhoods. The research found that French or English is disproportionately heard nearby Francophone or Anglophone, respectively, educational institutions. Some minorities in Beirut also speak Armenian, Aramaic, and Amharic.\n\nBeirut Central District\nThe Beirut Central District (BCD) or Centre Ville is the name given to Beirut's historical and geographical core by \"Solidere\", the \"vibrant financial, commercial, and administrative hub of the country\". It is an area thousands of years old, traditionally a focus of business, finance, culture and leisure. Its reconstruction constitutes one of the most ambitious contemporary urban developments. Due to the devastation incurred on the city center from the Lebanese Civil War, the Beirut Central District underwent a thorough reconstruction and development plan that gave it back its cultural and economic position in the region. Ever since, Beirut Central District has evolved into an integrated business and commercial environment and the focus of the financial activity in the region. That evolution was accompanied with the relocation of international organizations, reoccupation of civic and government buildings, expansion of financial activities, and establishment of regional headquarters and global firms in the city center.\n\nAssessment of the demand for build-up space in the BCD has been done in reference to a number of macro-economic, demographic, and urban planning considerations at a time of marked need for new activity poles in the city, such as Souks, financial, cultural and recreational centers. The district's total area is 4,690,000 square metres (50,482,740 square feet), the majority of which is dedicated to residential space (1,924,000 square metres or 20,709,764 square feet). The Beirut Central District contains over 60 gardens, squares and open spaces. These spaces comprise landscaped streets, gardens, historical squares, pedestrian areas and sea promenades thus totaling to an area of 96 acres (39 ha) of open spaces.\nThe central district is Lebanon's prime location for shopping, entertainment, and dining. There are over 100 cafes, restaurants, pubs and nightclubs open in the Beirut Central District, and over 350 retail outlets distributed along its streets and quarters. Beirut Souks alone are home to over 200 stores and a handful of restaurants and cafes. Beirut Souks are the Central District's old medieval market, recently renovated along with the original Hellenistic street grid that characterized the old souks and the area's historical landmarks along long vaulted shopping alleys and arcades. Solidere, the company responsible for the reconstruction and renovation of the district, organizes music and entertainment events all throughout the year like the Beirut Marathon, Fête de la Musique, Beirut Jazz Festival.\nHowever, the means of urban development in this particular area of the city was subject to much criticism and controversy. Rafic Hariri, who would later become prime minister, was the majority stakeholder of the company, which raises concerns of conflict of interest in the context of a public-private partnership. Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at undervalued land rates, and partly paid in company share. Strict urbanization laws were put in order to oblige people to sell and not renovate themselves. Today, Solidere acts as a de facto municipality, thus this quarter of the city is effectively privatized. It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay, a marina where many restaurants are located, and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police.\nThe project was also criticized for destroying some of the city's architectural and cultural heritage. \"Among the hundreds of destroyed buildings were \"the last Ottoman and medieval remains in Beirut\" wrote American University of Beirut professor Nabil Beyhum in the Journal The Beirut Review in 1992. Much of the damage had been done through unapproved demolitions in the 1980s and early 1990s, bringing down \"some of the capital's most significant buildings and structures,\" wrote UCLA professor Saree Makdisi in the journal, Critical Inquiry, in 1997.\". Moreover, many of the traditional privately owned shops in the Beirut Downtown were replaced by luxury outlets and high-end restaurants that only few people could afford. And most of public spaces promised by Solidere since the start of the reconstruction, such as \"The Garden of Forgiveness\", a central park, and an archaeological museum, remain unfinished until today, putting into question the actual benefit of the project to the population.\nThe actual success of the project has recently been in doubt, given that large quarters of the BCD are today empty, due to strong military presence, the Nejmeh Square where the parliament is located is most frequently completely deserted, and the businesses located there have mostly moved.\n\nEconomy\nBeirut's economy is service-oriented with the main growth sectors being banking and tourism.\nBeirut became a banking hub by leveraging its position as a commercial port and cultural center within the world economy. Under French mandate after World War I, France heavily invested in the city, reinforcing its role as a regional financial center. The Open Door Policy facilitated foreign capital inflows, with French firms dominating investments and four of Beirut's five leading banks being French-owned by the 1920s, after which the city further solidified its status as a key financial link between the West and the decolonizing Middle East.\nIn an area dominated by authoritarian or militarist regimes, the Lebanese capital was generally regarded as a haven of libertarianism, though a precarious one, as the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990) and subsequent conflicts significantly altered the political landscape. With its seaport and airport—coupled with Lebanon's free economic and foreign exchange system, solid gold-backed currency, banking-secrecy law, and favorable interest rates—Beirut became an established banking center for Arab wealth, much of which was invested in construction, commercial enterprise, and industry (mostly the manufacture of textiles and shoes, food processing, and printing). The economy of Beirut is diverse, including publishing, banking, trade and various industries. During that period, Beirut was the region's financial services center. At the onset of the oil boom starting in the 1960s, Lebanon-based banks were the main recipients of the region's petrodollars.\n\nBeirut is the focal point of the Economy of Lebanon. The capital hosts the headquarters of Banque du Liban  (Lebanon's central bank), the Beirut Stock Exchange, the head office of Lebanon's flag-carrier Middle East Airlines, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, the Union of Arab Banks, and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges.\n\nBanking and finance\nThe banking system is the backbone of the local economy with a balance sheet of $152 billion at the end of 2012, nearing 3.5 times the GDP estimated at $43 billion by the IMF. Bank deposits also increased in 2012 by 8% to 125 billion dollars, 82 percent of the sector's assets. \"Banks are still attracting deposits because the interest rates offered are higher than the ones in Europe and the United States\", says Marwan Mikhael, head of research at BLOM Bank.\nBeirut's foreign reserves were still close to an all-time high when they reached $32.5 billion in 2011 and analysts say that the Central Bank can cover nearly 80 percent of the Lebanese currency in the market. This means that the Central Bank can easily cope with any unforeseen crisis in the future thanks to the massive foreign currency reserves.\nThe Lebanese banking system is endowed with several characteristics that promote the role of Beirut as a regional financial center, in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings. The Lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency. Moreover, no restrictions are put on the free flow of capital and earnings into and out of the Lebanese economy. The passing of the banking secrecy law on 3 September 1956, subjected all banks established in Lebanon as well as foreign banks' branches to the \"secret of the profession\". Both article 16 of law No. 282 dated 30 December 1993 and article 12 of decree No. 5451 dated 26 August 1994, offer exemptions from income tax on all interest and revenues earned on all types of accounts opened in Lebanese banks. On the first of April 1975, decree No. 29 established a free banking zone by granting the Lebanese government the right to exempt non-residents' deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from: the income tax on interest earned, the required reserves imposed by the Banque Du Liban by virtue of article 76 of the Code of Money and Credit, the premium of deposit guarantee imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the National Deposit Guarantee Institution.\n\nTourism\nThe tourism industry in Beirut has been historically important to the local economy and remains to this day to be a major source of revenue for the city, and Lebanon in general. Before the Lebanese Civil War, Beirut was widely regarded as the \"Paris of the Middle East\",  and also \"Switzerland of the Middle East\", often cited as a financial and business hub where visitors could experience the Levantine Mediterranean culture. Beirut's diverse atmosphere and ancient history make it an important destination which is slowly rebuilding itself after continued turmoil. However, in recent times, certain countries, such as the United States, have frequently placed Lebanon, and Beirut in particular, on their travel warnings lists due to the many car bombings and orchestrated acts of political violence.\n\nAccording to the 2012 tourist statistics, 34% of the tourists in Beirut came from states within the Arab League, 33% came from European countries (mainly France, Germany, and Britain), and 16% from the Americas (about half of which are from the United States).\nThe largely pedestrianized Beirut Central District is the core of the Beirut tourism scene. The district is a cluster of stone-façade buildings lining arcaded streets and radial alleyways. The architecture of the area is a mix of French Architecture and Venetian Gothic architecture mixed with Arabesque and Ottoman Architecture. The district contains numerous old mosques and crusader churches, as well as uncovered remnants and ruins of the Roman era. The District contains dozens of restaurants, cafes and pubs, as well as a wide range of shopping stores mainly in Beirut Souks. High-rise hotels and towers line the district's New Waterfront, marina and seaside promenade.\nAnother popular tourist destination in Beirut is the Corniche Beirut, a 4.8 km (3 mi) pedestrian promenade that encircles the capital's seafront from the Saint George Bay in the north all the way to Avenue de Paris and Avenue General de Gaulle south of the city. The corniche reaches its maximum height above sea level at Raouché, a high-rise residential neighbourhood rising over a giant white limestone cliff and facing the recognisable off-shore Raouché Rocks.\nBadaro is one of Beirut's most appealing neighborhoods, a lovely place to stroll during daytime and a destination for going out in the evening. Badaro is within Beirut's green district with a 75-acre (30-hectare) public park (The Beirut Pine forest) and a 50-acre (20-hectare) hippodrome. It is a neighborhood on a very human scale with small groceries around every corner. The neighborhood residents, a mix of old impoverished Christian bourgeoisie, bohemian style people in their 30s and well-established urban professionals, are loyal to local bakery and pastry shops. Because of the blossoming café and bar scene it has become lately a hip destination for Beirut's young and restless but old Beirutis remember that Badaro was already Beirut's version of the Village in the swinging sixties. Groceries and eateries can be found on almost every street of the area. There are dozens of restaurants, pubs and footpath cafés of virtually every style. Badaro \"Village\" thrives on local residents, day-trippers and hipsters from all over Beirut, office employees and many expatriates.\nHamra Street is a long cobblestone street connecting the Beirut Central District with the coastal Raouche area. The street is a large concentration of shopping stores, boutiques, restaurants, banks, street vendors, footpath cafes, newspaper kiosks, and a booming nightlife spurred by students from the neighboring American University of Beirut. The AUB campus is another popular visitor destination, composed of a cluster of 19th century red-roofed buildings dispersed on a wooded hillside overlooking the Mediterranean.\nGemmayzeh is Beirut's artistic bohemian quarter, full of narrow streets and historic buildings from the French era. It is located East of the Beirut Central District, bordering the Saifi Village. The neighborhood is well known for its trendy bars and pubs, cafes, restaurants and lounges; most are directly located on Rue Gouraud, the main thoroughfare that cuts through the middle of the district. Travel + Leisure magazine called Gemmayzeh \"SoHo by the Sea,\" due to its colorful and chic cafés amid 1950s apartment buildings and hole-in-the-wall shops. However, Gemmayzeh received the most damage by the Beirut explosion in 2020.\n\nBeirut is a destination for tourists from both the Arab world and West. In Travel + Leisure magazine's World Best Awards 2006, it was ranked the 9th best city in the world. That list was voted upon shortly before the 2006 Lebanon War broke out, but in 2008 The Guardian listed Beirut as one of its top ten cities in the world. The New York Times ranked it at number one on its \"44 places to go\" list of 2009. 2011 MasterCard Index revealed that Beirut had the second-highest visitor spending levels in the Middle East and Africa, totaling $6.5 billion. Beirut was chosen in 2012 by Condé Nast Traveller as the best city in the Middle East, beating Tel Aviv and Dubai.\nMany of the tourists are returning Lebanese expatriates, but many are from Western countries. Approximately 3 million visitors visited in 2010; the previous record was 1.4 million in 1974.\nLike other forms of tourism, medical tourism in Lebanon is on the rise recently. Although visitors from neighboring Arab nations make up the bulk of medical tourism patients here due to its proximity, Beirut is strongly trying to woo more Southern Europeans, Asians and North Americans to its land. Its Agency for Investment Development in Lebanon reports that growth in the medical tourism industry is growing by up to 30% a year since 2009. The country's tourism ministry is working closely with the medical sector and top-class hotels to create an organized, quality medical destination. Major hotel and spa chains work with local clinics, travel agencies and the tourism ministry to create comprehensive healthcare and recuperation packages for foreign visitors. The government is highly involved in this industry and strives to make the process as easy as possible.\nCosmetic surgery is a major component of medical tourism in Lebanon. Most of the foreign patients come for routine operations like plastic surgery, dental or eye surgery, and Beirut's hospitals are also capable of performing specialized procedures such as internal bypass surgery and other technical treatments. Its top clinics and hospitals like Sahel General are equipped to handle the full range of surgical procedures. Beirut-based Clemenceau Medical Center (CMC), affiliated with Johns Hopkins International, was ranked one of the world's top ten best hospitals for medical tourism in 2012.\n\nGovernment\nBeirut is the capital of Lebanon and its seat of government. The Lebanese Parliament, all the Ministries and most of the public administrations, embassies and consulates are there. Beirut Governorate is one of eight mohafazat (plural of mohafazah, or governorate).\n\nInternational organizations\nThe city is home to numerous international organizations. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) is headquartered in downtown Beirut, The Arab Air Carriers' Organization (AACO), the Union of Arab Banks and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges and  the World youth alliance are also headquartered in the city. The International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) both have regional offices in Beirut covering the Arab world.\n\nEducation\nHigher education throughout Lebanon is provided by universities, colleges and technical and vocational institutes. The Directorate General of Higher Education is responsible for managing universities, colleges, and institutes in Beirut and nationwide.\nThe American University of Beirut (AUB) and Université Saint-Joseph (USJ) are the oldest English-language and French-language universities in the country, respectively. AUB was founded in 1866, and USJ in 1875. The Lebanese University is the only public institution for higher education in Beirut. Beirut is also home to Lebanese American University (LAU), American University of Science and Technology (AUST), University of Balamand, École Supérieure des Affaires (ESA), Beirut Arab University (BAU), Haigazian University (HU), Lebanese International University (LIU), Notre Dame University – Louaize (NDU), and Université La Sagesse (ULS).\nAmong the private secondary schools in Beirut are Lycee Abdel Kader, Grand Lycée Franco-Libanais, Lycée Franco-Libanais Verdun, American Community School, International College, Collège Louise Wegmann, Rawdah High School, Saint Mary's Orthodox College, Collège Notre Dame de Nazareth, Collège du Sacré-Coeur Gemmayzé, Collège Protestant Français, Armenian Evangelical Central High School, German School of Beirut, and the Armenian Hamazkayin Arslanian College.\n\nTransportation\nThe city's renovated airport is the Rafic Hariri International Airport, located in the southern suburbs. The Port of Beirut, one of the largest and most commercial in the eastern Mediterranean, is another port of entry. As a final destination, Lebanon can be reached by road from Damascus via the Beqaa valley in the east.\nBeirut has frequent bus connections to other cities in Lebanon and major cities in Syria such as Homs and its capital Damascus. There are a number of different companies providing public transport in Lebanon. The publicly owned buses are managed by Office des Chemins de Fer et des Transports en Commun (OCFTC – \"Railway and Public Transportation Authority\"). Buses for northern destinations and Syria leave from Charles Helou Station.\nThe ministry of transport and public works purchased an extra 250 intra and inter-buses in 2012 to better serve regions outside the capital as well as congestion-choked Beirut, hoping to lessen the use of private cars.\nBeirut has also private buses that are provided by the Lebanese Commuting Company.\nIn 2017, Beirut introduced a bike sharing service in certain areas of the city.\nIn 2024, Ahdab Commuting and Trading Company (ACTC), alongside the Ministry of Transport, reintroduced a proper public bus system with an appropriate network of lanes using the 50 buses donated by France in 2022. \nThe network connects most areas of Beirut through 7 major lines (B1-7), as well as connecting Beirut to other major cities like Tripoli and Saida through 4 lines (ML1-4). These lines however do not replace the existing service microbuses, they complement them.\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Beirut has evolved under the influence of many different peoples and civilizations, such as Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Ottoman Turks and French. The law school in downtown Beirut was one of the world's earliest and was considered to be a leading center of legal studies in the Eastern Roman Empire.\nBeirut hosted the Francophonie and Arab League summits in 2002, and in 2007 it hosted the ceremony for the Prix Albert Londres, which rewards outstanding francophone journalists every year. The city also hosted the Jeux de la Francophonie in 2009. In the same year, it was proclaimed World Book Capital by UNESCO.\nBeirut has also been called the \"party capital of the Arab world\". Rue Monnot has an international reputation among clubbers, and Rue Gouraud in districts such as Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael have emerged as new hotspots for bar patrons and clubbers, as well as \"The Alleyway\" in Hamra Street.\n\nMuseums\nThe National Museum of Beirut is the principal museum of archaeology in Lebanon. It has about 1,300 exhibits ranging in date from prehistoric times to the medieval Mamluk period. The Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut is the third-oldest museum in the Middle East, exhibiting a wide range of artefacts from Lebanon and neighboring countries. Sursock Museum was built by the illustrious Sursock family at the end of the 19th century as a private villa for Nicolas Sursock, and then donated to the Lebanese state upon his death. It now houses Beirut's most influential and popular art museum. The permanent collection shows a set of Japanese engravings, numerous works of Islamic art and classic Italian paintings, while temporary exhibitions are also shown throughout the year. The Robert Mouawad Private Museum near Beirut's Grand Serail exhibits Henri Pharaon's private collection of archaeology and antiques.\nPlanet Discovery is a children's science museum with interactive experiments, exhibitions, performances, workshops and awareness competitions. The Saint Joseph University opened the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory in 2000, the first prehistory museum in the Arabic Middle East, displaying bones, stone tools and neolithic pottery collected by Jesuits.\nIn October 2013, Mim Museum, a private mineral museum, opened its doors to the public. It has on display some 2000 minerals from more than 70 countries. Mim museum's collection is considered to be one of the world's paramount private collection for the variety and quality of its minerals. A didactic circuit, accompanied by screens showing films and scientific applications of mineralogy, will reveal a world of unsuspected marvels—priceless both from an aesthetic and scientific point of view. Mimodactylus libanensis \"mimo\", the fossil of a Pterodactyl, is featured in a special wing. This one-of-a-kind complete specimen in the Middle-East was found in Lebanon. It is promoted by means of state-of-the-art modern techniques: a hologram, an auto-stereoscopic movie, a full-scale reconstitution and a game \"fly with mimo\" – an entertainment that delights children and adults. Moreover, Mim hosts a thematic exhibition of 200 marine fossils. \"Fish'n'Stone\" was organised with the collaboration of Mémoire du Temps. Known throughout the world, those fossils were quarried in the Lebanese mountains. The history of the fossil formation is shown through an animation that submerges you in the marine life – a time capsule that takes you in a journey to some 100 million of years ago.\n\nTourism\nBeirut was named the top place to visit by The New York Times in 2009, and as one of the ten liveliest cities in the world by Lonely Planet in the same year. According to a 2010 study by the American global consulting firm Mercer comparing high-end items such as upscale residential areas and entertainment venues, Beirut was ranked as the 4th most expensive city in the Middle East and 15th among the Upper Middle Income Countries included in the survey.

وسطها التجاري وواجهتها البحريه وملاهيها الليليه مما اعاد تالق سياحتها وجعلها مقصداً سياحياً جذاباً. قامت صحيفه النيويورك تايمز بمنح بيروت المركز الاول بين قائمه الاماكن التي ينبغي زيارتها في سنه 2009، كما صُنّفت ضمن المدن العشره الاوائل الاكثر حيويه في عام 2009 بواسطه دليل لونلي بلانت السياحي. وفي عام 2020، مرّت بيروت بكارثه اُخرى حيث حصلَ انفجار ضخم في مرفا المدينه مما خلف عشرات القتلى والاف الجرحى وتسبب بدمار كبير في عدد من احيائها نتج عنه نزوح 300 الف مواطن لبناني.\nكشف مؤشر «ماستر كارد» لعام 2011، ان بيروت استاثرت بالمركز الثاني من حيث نسبه البذخ السياحي بين جميع مدن الشرق الاوسط

دولار)، فجوهانسبرغ (3.3 مليارات دولار). كذلك وُضعت بيروت في المرتبه التاسعه بين قائمه اكثر المدن زيارهً في العالم.\n\nالتسميه\nاقدم ذكر عبر الوثائق التاريخيه لاسم بيروت ورد بلفظ «بيروتا» في الواح تل العمارنه التي وجدت في مصر، والتي تحوي مراسلات تمت بين ملوك جبيل والفرعون امينوفيس الرابع المعروف باخناتون (مطلع القرن الرابع عشر ق.م.) ورد فيها اسم «بيروتا» وملكها «عمونيرا». سماها الفنيقيون «بيريت» ँ‌ऀ‌ओ‌क وهي كلمه فينيقيه تعني الابار. وقيل انها كانت تدعى\n«بيريتيس» او «بيروتوس» او «بيرُووَه» نسبه للالهه «بيروت»، اعز الهه لبنان وصاحبه ادونيس اله جبيل. وعُرفت المدينه باسم «بيريتوس» (باليونانيه القديمه:βηρυτός) في الادبيات الاغريقيه. واعتمد هذا الاسم في دوريات الاثار المنشوره في الجامعه الاميركيه في بيروت منذ 1934.\nوذكر ان «بيروت» بالمعنى السامي تعني «الصنوبر» لغابات الصنوبر، بسبب وقوعها بالقرب من غابه صنوبر كبيره هي اليوم ما يُعرف بحرش او حرج بيروت. ومن الاسماء الاخرى التي دعيت بها منطقه بيروت هو: «لاذقيه كنعان»، «مستوطنه جوليا اغسطس بيريتوس السعيده»، «دربي»، «رديدون»، «باروت». ولقبت

معهد للقانون بالامبراطوريه فيها. ونعتها العثمانيون «بالدره الغاليه». في العصر الحديث خلدها نزار قباني بلقب «ست الدنيا». وعرفت ايضا باسم «باريس الشرق» خلال فتره الستينات واوائل السبعينات من القرن العشرين، اي خلال عهد الازدهار الاقتصادي في لبنان.\n\nتاريخ بيروت\nيعود تاريخ بيروت الى اكثر من 5000 عام. تدل اعمال الحفريات الاثريه في وسط بيروت على تنوع الحضارات التي مرت على المدينه، فقد عُثر على طبقات متعدده من الاثار الفينيقيه والهيلينيه والرومانيه والعربيه والعثمانيه التي تبعد عن بعضها بمسافه ضئيله.\n\nعصور ما قبل التاريخ\nاكتشف الباحثون وعلماء الاثار عدّه مواقع اثريه تقع ضمن حدود المناطق التي تُشكّل مدينه بيروت المعاصره، وكان معظم هذه المواقع يحتوي على ادوات صوّانيه تعود لعهود متعاقبه تبدا من العصرين الحجريين: القديم الوسيط والقديم العلوي، مرورًا بالعصر الحجري الحديث ووصولاً الى العصر البرونزي. اما ابرز هذه المواقع فهي:\n\nموقع ميناء الحصن: وصفه الباحثون بانه «قريه بيروتيّه»، ويُرجّح ان موقع الاصلي كان على شاطئ البحر بالقرب من فندقيّ الشرق وبسول، في الجادّه الفرنسيه المعروفه محليًا باسم «شارع الفرنساويه». اكتُشف الموقع في سنه 1894، ودُرس لاول مره على يد احد الاباء اليسوعيين في سنه 1900. وُصفت الادوات الصوانيه التي عُثر عليها في الموقع بانها موستيريه، وقد احتفظ بها متحف الفنون الجميله في ليون.\nموقع ام الخطيب: يقع شمال منطقه الطريق الجديده الحاليه، وعُثر فيه على ادوات صوّانيه ترجع للعصر النحاسي. تدمّر هذا الموقع بعد ان شُيدت عليه مبان في سنه 1948.\nموقع فرن الشبّاك: يقع على الضفه اليسرى من نهر بيروت، حيث تنتهي حدود المدينه. كانت المنطقه مغطاه سابقًا بالرمال الحمراء التي شكّلت مصاطبًا للنهر ترجع للعصر الرباعي. عثرت مجموعه من الاباء اليسوعيين على هذا الموقع، واكتشفوا فيه عدد كبير من الادوات الصوّانيه التي تعود للعصر الحجري القديم الوسيط، وقد كان معظمها مغروسًا في الرمال على ضفه النهر. شملت المكتشفات حوالي 50 اداه قطع تعود للفتره الاشولينيه، يحتفظ بها اليوم المتحف اللبناني للاثار القبتاريخيه.\nموقع نهر بيروت: قيل بانه وقع في بستان لاشجار التوت على الضفه اليسرى للنهر بالقرب من خط سكه الحديد المتوجهه الى طرابلس. اكتشف في هذا الموقع عدّه بقايا لرماح وحجاره صوّانيه مسننه وعظام مدفونه وسط الطمي. وقد شُيّدت عليه مبان في الوقت الحالي.\nكما عُثر في مواقع اخرى، اهمها موقعا البطركيّه والبرج، على بقايا فؤوس قديمه، وعلى قبور تعود لاواسط العصر البرونزي، في المنطقه الاخيره، مما دفع الباحثين للقول ان «تل» بيروت القديم، او المستعمره البشريه الرئيسيّه، كانت تقوم في ذاك المكان.\n\nالعصور القديمه\nبُنيت بيروت من قبل اهل جبيل (بيبلوس) قبل اربعه الاف سنه، وما لبثت ان كبرت وعمرت بالسكان واصبحت مملكه مستقله على الساحل الذي كان يُعرف باسم فينيقيا وعبد اهلها الها خاصاً بها اسمه «بعل بيريت» اي اله او سيّد بيروت، وضربت باسمها عمله نقديّه تحمل رسماً يمثل هذا الاله. واول اشاره لمدينه بيروت تعود للقرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد حيث ذكرت في رسائل تل العمارنه المسماريه التي ذكرت عن «عمونيرا» ملك «بيريت». الذي ارسل ثلاث رسائل الى الفرعون المصري. كما ذكرت «بيريت» في رسائل «رب حدا» ملك جبيل. وانشئت اول مستوطناتها على جزيره وسط نهرها التي طُمرت عبر الازمان.\nخضعت بيروت لحكم المصريين بعد ان قام الفرعون تحتموس الثالث باحتلال الساحل الشرقي للبحر المتوسط اثناء طرده للهكسوس من مصر، وبعد المصريين قام كل من الاشوريين والكلدانيين والفرس بالسيطره على فينيقيا ومنها بيروت، قبل ان يهزم الاسكندر الاكبر الفرس ويضم المدينه لامبراطوريته. وفي سنه 140ق.م احتلها ودمرها «ديودوتوس تريفون»، الملك الهيليني، خلال صراعه مع «انيوخس السابع» للسيطره على عرش الدوله السلوقيه. ومن ثم اعيد بناؤها على الطراز الهيليني وسميت «لاوديسيا الفينيقيه» (باليونانيه: Λαοδικεια ή του Φοινίκη) وفي بعض الاحيان «لاوديسيا الكنعانيه». تقع المدينه اليوم على انقاض تلك التي بناها اليونان، كما اظهرت الحفريات التي اعيد العمل بها بعد انتهاء الحرب الاهليه سنه 1991. وتشير احدى الحفريات من سنه 1994 الى ان شارع «سوق الطويله» الحديث هو تطور لشارع هيليني او روماني قديم.\n\nواحتل بيروت الجنرال الروماني ماركوس اغريبا في عام 64 ق.م. وسماها «مستوطنه جوليا اغسطس بيريتوس السعيده» (باللاتينيه: Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus) تيمنا بجوليا بنت الامبراطور اغسطس ونظرا لاهميه المدينه تمركز فيها الفيلقان الرومانيان: المقدوني الخامس، والغالي الثالث مما حولها الى جزء من الامبراطوريه الرومانيه وبالتالي تمّ تعميرها وفقا للنمط المعماري الروماني، فبُنيت فيها الابنيه، من هياكل ومسارح وحمامات، ومؤسسات حكوميّه فخمه.\nعرفت المدينه ازهى ايامها خلال عهد هيرودوس فاصبحت مدينه رومانيه كامله الحقوق في سنه 14 ق.م، ومنحت لقب المستمعره الممتازه. اشتهرت بيروت تحت الحكم الروماني بمدرسه القانون والتي استمرت بتدريس الحقوق لاكثر من 300 عام، وكانت في ذلك العهد مرجعاً لطلاب العلم من الوطنيين والاجانب. وهي المدرسه التي اكسبت المدينه في ذلك الحين للقب «ام الشرائع ومرضعه العلوم». من اشهر مدرسيها الحقوقيين الفينيقيين «بابينيانوس» و«اولبيانوس»، الذين اشتهرا خلال حكم الاباطره السيفريين، والذي كان عملهما اساس قانون جستنيان الاول المعروف «بالبندكتس». دُمرت المدرسه نتيجهً لموجه الزلازل التي ضربت بيروت في سنه551 للميلاد، فنقل طلابها الى مدينه صيدون. وقتل الزلزال 30,000 بيروتي و250,000 من سكان الساحل الفينيقي، الامر الذي افقد بيروت اهميتها خلال السنين المتبقيه لها تحت حكم الروم البيزنطينين.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nبعد حوالي مائه سنه من دمار المدينه، اي خلال سنه 635م، فتحها العرب بقياده معاويه بن ابي سفيان في زمن خلافه عمر بن الخطاب ثاني الخلفاء الراشدين الذي امر بترميمها وتحصينها بالقلاع لحمايتها من هجمات الروم الذين حاولوا عبثاً استعادتها عده مرات. وفي تلك الفتره لم تحظ بيروت بشهره كبيره واهميه تذكر مثل تلك التي حظيت بها مدينه عكا كمركز تجاري في شرقي البحر المتوسط.\nعندما ارتقى معاويه بن ابي سفيان سده الخلافه الاسلاميّه جلب الى بيروت قوماً من الفرس واسكنهم فيها مثلما فعل بغيرها من مدن الساحل الشامي وبعلبك. كانت المدينه خلال عهد الخلفاء الراشدين والامويين ثم العباسيين، تابعه لدمشق، واتخذها المسلمون في العهود المذكوره رباطاً، اي قاعده عسكريّه، ومنها انطلقت الجيوش العربيّه التي حملها معاويه على الاسطول الذي فتح به جزيره قبرص ايام عثمان بن عفان. وفي ايام ابي جعفر المنصور، ثاني الخلفاء العباسيين، ظهر فيها عدد من العلماء البارزين اهمهم عبد الرحمن الاَوزاعي، المعروف باسم «الامام الاوزاعي» المتوفى سنه 773، وقبره ما يزال موجوداً بالقرب منها عند الجهه الجنوبيّه على ساحل البحر، في منطقه اصبحت تحمل اسمه، وهذا القبر كان وما يزال مقصداً للناس الذين يزورونه ويتبركون به. استعاد ملك البيزنطيين «يوحنا زيميسياس» بيروت عام 974 ولبث فيها نحو سنه، ثم اخرجته منها القوات المصريّه التي ارسبها جوهر الصقلي في ايام العبيديين حكّام مصر في ذلك الحين، وفي زمنهم كانت هذه المدينه تابعه لدمشق المرتبطه راساً بالقاهره حاضره الخلافه العبيديّه يومذاك.\n\nهاجمت جيوش الصليبيين بيروت سنه 1102، بالرغم من انها لم تكن مهمه في ذلك الوقت، لكنها امتنعت عليهم وصدتهم، فلما كانت سنه 1110 اعادت هذه الجيوش الكرّه عليها بقياده «بغدوين الاول» وتمكنت من احتلالها. وبقي الصليبيون في المدينه حتى سنه 1291، وكانت في تلك الفتره تابعه لمملكه بيت المقدس وقد اعتمد ازدهارها في ذلك الوقت على حركه تبادلها التجاري مع اوروبا في البهارات. ومن اشهر القواد الصليبيين الذين حكموا بيروت، «يوحنا الاول سيد ابلين»، الملقب «بسيد بيروت العجوز» (1179–1236) الذي قام بترميم المدينه بعد المعارك المتعدده مع صلاح الدين الايوبي، كما بنى قصر ال ابلين فيها. استعاد صلاح الدين الايوبي بيروت في سنه 1187، لكنها عادت الى الصليبيين بعد حوالي عشره اعوام، وبعد ان زالت الدوله الايوبيه وحلت مكانها دوله المماليك ارسل الملك الاشرف خليل ابن الملك قلاوون الصالحي جيشاً كبيراً الى المدينه فاستعادها وجعلها تابعه لنيابه طرابلس الشام التي كانت مرتبطه راساً بالقاهره مقر السلطه المملوكيّه انذاك.\n\nالعصور الحديثه\nفي سنه 1516 تغلب السلطان سليم الاول العُثماني على قنصوه الغوري سلطان المماليك وقضى عليه في معركه مرج دابق شمالي حلب، وتابع زحفه حتى احتل جميع بلاد الشام، ومن ذلك الحين دخلت بيروت في حوزه الدوله العثمانيه وكان اول حاكم عُثماني فيها محمد بن قرقماز (قرقماز اوغلو) وهو جركسي. حُكمت المدينه من قبل الامراء الدروز،  تاره من بني عسّاف وتاره من بني سيفا، ابتداءً من القرن السادس عشر، وفي تلك الفتره كانت بيروت مجرد قريه عاديه، بعد ان قل فيها التجار وضعفت الاعمال الصناعيه، والمهن البحريه، كالصيد وصناعه السفن وترميمها وتزويدها بالمؤن، وذلك اما لانتشار القراصنه في البحر المتوسط في ذلك الوقت، او لانصراف الكثير من القوافل البحريه الى الدوران حول افريقيا عن طريق راس الرجاء الصالح الذي اكتشف سنه 1498، فتحولت بذلك طريق التجاره مع الهند اليه بدلا من المرافئ اللبنانيه. وفي السنوات العشر الاخيره من القرن السادس عشر للميلاد، تغلب الامير فخر الدين بن معن على الامير يوسف بن سيفا الذي كان حاكماً على مدينه طرابلس وبلاد كسروان ومدينه بيروت وانتزع منه المقاطعه الكسروانيّه وبيروت وطرد من هذه المدينه الاغا الذي كان متسلماً عليها من طرف ابن سيفا. وقام فخر الدين خلال القرن السابع عشر بالاعتناء بعمران المدينه بشكل كبير، فازدهرت وانفتحت على اوروبا في ايامه، ومن المعالم التي انشاها: البرج الذي عُرف فيما بعد باسم برج الكشاف، لانه استُعمل مرقباً لاستكشاف المراكب المعاديه التي تحاول الاغاره على البلد، واليه تنسب ساحه البرج الواقعه في الجهه الشرقيه منه، والتي اصبحت تعرف اليوم بساحه الشهداء او ساحه الحريه، وكذلك انشا الامير قصراً له في بيروت بالاستعانه بخبرات بعض المهندسين الايطاليين، وحديقه للحيوانات، وقام بزياده عدد اشجار الصنوبر في حرج بيروت وتنسيق تلك الموجوده. وبعد زوال الاماره المعنيه عادت بيروت لتتبع ولايه طرابلس من جديد.\n\nفي السنوات الاخيره من القرن الثامن عشر شهدت بيروت صراعاً شديداً بين حاكمها الشهابي الامير يوسف وبين احد اتباعه احمد باشا الجزار، عندما كان كل منهما يحاول الاستئثار بها وتعرضت خلال هذا الصراع لاحتلالها من قبل اميرال البحر «سبنسكوف» الروسي، الذي كان يقوم باعمال القرصنه في المياه العثمانيّه لحساب امبراطوره روسيا كاترين الثانيه، فلقد نصّب هذا القرصان مدافع في سهلات البرج ليتمكن من ضرب سور المدينه من قرب، ولهذا السبب اطلق الافرنج على هذه السهلات اسم «ساحه المدفع»، ولكن احتلال الروس انتهى بعد شهور قليله بعد ان دفعت لهم المدينه غرامه قدرها 25 الف ريال بعمله ذلك الزمان. فعاد اليها الجزار وقبض على سيده السابق الامير يوسف الشهابي بمعاونه ابن اخ الاخير، الامير بشير الثاني الشهابي المشهور بالمالطي، واعدمه سنه 1790 في مدينه عكا. في ايام الجزار مُنع الشهابيون من الاقامه في بيروت، وهُدمت بيوتهم التي كانت فيها، كما مُنع اهل جبل لبنان من السكن في هذه المدينه التي الحقها الوالي المذكور بمدينه عكا التي اتخذها مركزاً له باسم ولايه عكا. والجزار هو الذي بنى السور الذي كان يحيط بيروت من كافه اطرافها ومنع الناس من السكن خارجه، فسجل انخفاض في عدد سكان المدينه الى 8,000 نسمه في تلك الفتره، وبقي هذا المنع سارياً حتى سنه 1832، ففي هذه السنه اقتحمها ابراهيم باشا بن محمد علي باشا وهدم السور واباح بناء المساكن خارجه، فعاد لبيروت دورها المهم مره اخرى.\nبقيت بيروت تحت الحكم المصري من سنه 1832 حتى 1841 وهي المده التي بقيت فيها بلاد الشام في حوزه ابراهيم باشا. وفي هذه الفتره عرفت هذه المدينه تطوراً اساسيًا شمل سائر مرافقها العُمرانيّه والاداريّه، ونما عدد سكانها يومئذٍ من 8 الاف نسمه الى 15 الفاً، وذلك بسبب امتداد رقعتها الى خارج السور الذي امر ابراهيم باشا بهدمه وسمح للناس ببناء مساكنهم في الضواحي التي اصبحت فيما بعد جزءاً من المدينه نفسها، كما ازدهرت احوالها التجاريّه بسبب اختيارها مركزاً للحجر الصحي، الامر الذي اجبر جميع القادمين الى الشام على الخضوع له للتاكد من سلامتهم الصحيّه وخلوهم من الامراض المعديّه. وخلال عهد المصريين كان حاكم بيروت هو القائد في الجيش المصري سليمان باشا الفرنساوي. في سنه 1841 تمكنت الدوله العُثمانيّه من استعاده سيطرتها على بلاد الشام، فقاموا بنقل كرسي الولايه اليها وعيّنوا عليها والياً من قبلهم اسمه سليم باشا. وفي عهد هذا الوالي بدات بيروت بالازدهار فازدادت عماراً وسكاناً، وانتقلت اليها تجاره الافرنج، وعظم شانها، وكثر مجيء المراكب الاوروبيّه اليها. وخلال احداث 1860 بين الدروز والمسيحيين، لجا الكثير من الموارنه النصارى الى بيروت هربا من المذابح في جبل لبنان ودمشق.\n\nخلال منتصف القرن التاسع عشر ازداد سكان بيروت وتوسعت المدينه لتتخطى اسوارها. وفي خضم هذا التوسع قامت الارساليات الغربيه ومفكرو العالم العربي بتكوين المدينه. واصبحت مركز الثقافه والفكر العربي ومركز تنوع عالمي بوجود الاوروبيين والاميركيين. فشركه المياه كانت بريطانيه وشركه امداد الغاز كانت فرنسيه فيما انشا الاميركيون المدارس والجامعات ومن اشهرها الجامعه الاميركيه في بيروت. واشتهرت فيها صناعات وتجاره الحرير. كما انشا الفرنسيون مرفا بحريا عصريا في سنه 1894 ومدوا سكك الحديد بين بيروت ودمشق وحلب في سنه 1907. وكانت السفن الفرنسيه تنقل البضائع بين بيروت ومارسيليا وسرعان ما اصبح للفرنسيين تاثير اكبر من اي دوله غربيه اخرى، وفي تلك الفتره اخذ السكان يقتدون بالاوروبين في بعض نواحي عيشهم وفي ملبسهم. ونشرت موسوعه بريتانيكا ان توزيع سكان بيروت في سنه 1911 كان كالتالي: مسلمون (36,000 نسمه)، مسيحيون (77,000 نسمه)، يهود (2,500 نسمه)، دروز (400 نسمه)، اجانب (4,100 نسمه).\n\nالمرحله المعاصره\nخلال الحرب العالميه الاولى عصفت المجاعه والامراض بجبل لبنان نتيجه لبعض التدابير العثمانيه الضاره، وبسبب مجريات الحرب، وكنتيجه لهذا لجا الكثير من ابناء الجبل الى بيروت للحصول على لقمه عيشهم، وفي تلك الفتره قام بعض الوجهاء البيروتيين بتاسيس بعض الجمعيات التي اخذت على عاتقها تقديم المساعدات والاغاثات للجبليين مما خفف من وطاه الحرب عليهم. وبتاريخ 8 اكتوبر 1918 سقطت المدينه من العثمانيين ووقعت بايدي قوات الحلفاء بقياده الجنرال ادموند النبي. واعلنت عصبه الامم بيروت خاضعه للانتداب الفرنسي مع بقيه مناطق جبل لبنان، البقاع وسوريا الكبرى. ثم اعلنها الفرنسيون في 1920 عاصمه لدوله لبنان الكبير، والتي اصبحت الجمهوريه اللبنانيه في سنه 1926 ولكن لم تنل استقلالها الا في سنه 1943. وازدهرت بيروت خلال فتره الاستقلال واصبحت نقطه استقطاب ثقافي واقتصادي لكل محيطها. فاصبحت بمثابه البلد الثاني او المصيف للعديد من مواطني العالم العربي. وشهدت بيروت اضطرابات لفتره بسيطه سنه 1958 زمن الرئيس كميل شمعون بسبب الصراع حول حلف بغداد، وخلال فتره الستينات من القرن العشرين اصبحت المدينه تعرف باسم «باريس الشرق». وبعد حرب 1967 مع اسرائيل، اصبحت بيروت مركزاً اساسياً للفدائيين الفلسطينيين الذين حاربوا الاخيره.\n\nسنوات الحرب الاهليه\nوفي العام 1975 اندلعت الحرب الاهليه اللبنانيه وقسمت المدينه الى شطرين: شرقي مسيحي، وغربي مسلم، وعم المدينه الخراب والفوضى. وقام الجيش الاسرائيلي في سنه 1978 باجتياح لبنان واحتلال اراضيه من الجنوب حتى نهر الليطاني في عمليه اعطاها الجيش الاسرائيلي اسم هذا النهر ثم توسع الاحتلال في لبنان بعد العدوان الاسرائيلي الثاني في سنه 1982 ليصل مشارف العاصمه ويحاصرها. وفي سنه 1983 تمّ تفجير الثكنات العسكريه الفرنسيه والاميركيه في المدينه. وفي سنه 1990 استقر الوضع في لبنان وتوحدت بيروت وعادت اليها حركه العمران بسرعه لتعود مركزا تجارياً وثقافياً مهماً للمنطقه العربيه من جديد بجهود جباره من رئيس الوزراء اللبناني الاسبق رفيق الحريري.\nبعد اتفاق الطائف وانتهاء الحرب اللبنانيه ومع تولي الرئيس رفيق الحريري الحكومه بدا اعمار بيروت واعادتها مجدداً الى الساحه الدوليه، فبدا باعمار وسط بيروت التي قامت شركه سوليدير ببنائه، وغدت بيروت مجدداً باريس الشرق حتى سنه 2005.\n\nاغتيال رفيق الحريري - الان\nاغتيل رفيق الحريري بتاريخ 14 فبراير سنه 2005، بانفجار عبوه ناسفه كانت مزروعه على طريق خليج السان جورج حيث كان موكبه يعبر، واسفر الانفجار عن اضرار جسيمه لحقت بالمباني المجاوره، وعن مقتل عدد من رفاق الحريري وعدد من المارّه. وفور ذيوع خبر وفاه الحريري سارت مظاهرات في عدد من شوارع بيروت اطلق فيها المتظاهرون شعارات ضد رئيس الجمهوريه اميل لحود ورئيس الحكومه عمر كرامي والنظام السوري ممثلاً بالرئيس بشار الاسد، وعقد اطراف المعارضه اللبنانيه اجتماعًا في داره الحريري خلص الى تحميل السلطه اللبنانيه والسلطه السوريه «بصفتها سلطه الوصايه» المسؤوليه عن الجريمه. ودعا المجتمعون الى رحيل السلطه القائمه وانسحاب القوات السوريه بالكامل قبل الانتخابات، واعلنوا عن اضراب شامل لثلاثه ايام. شكّل اغتيال رفيق الحريري بدايه لسلسله من الاغتيالات التي طالت سياسيين لبنانيين يعارضون الوجود السوري في البلاد، وقد اعتصمت القوى السياسيه المعارضه في وسط بيروت التجاري طيله شهران، اغلقت خلالها الكثير من المصالح، الى ان انصاع رئيس الحكومه عمر كرامي، وتنحى عن منصبه، ثم تلا ذلك انسحبًا للجيش السوري من لبنان بتاريخ 26 ابريل تحت ضغط مظاهرات مناصري ما عرف لاحقًا بتحالف 14 اذار وقرار الامم المتحده رقم 1559. بعد انسحاب الجيش السوري حصلت عدّه مجادلات سياسيه بين السلطه والمعارضه. وتخلل ذلك عدوان اسرائيلي في يوليو 2006 دُمرت خلاله البنيه التحتيه اللبنانيه.\nوفي 7 ايار 2008، قام مسلحو المعارضه في لبنان من حزب الله وحركه امل والحزب القومي السوري بالسيطره على بيروت كردّ فعل على اتخاذ الحكومه قراراً بتفكيك شبكه الاتصالات الخاصه بالمقاومه وبعزل مدير مطار بيروت الدولي حيث اعتبرت المعارضه هذا القرار خرقًا للبيان الوزاري القاضي بدعم المقاومه في مواجهه الاحتلال الاسرائيلي. وتلا هذه العمليه اتفاق في مدينه الدوحه ادى الى اخلاء وسط بيروت من مظاهر الاضراب واعاد الثقه بالسياحه اللبنانيه. وبتاريخ 18 اكتوبر 2008 تبادل لبنان وسوريا السفراء لاول مره في تاريخهما.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع بيروت على شبه جزيره تتجه لناحيه الغرب نحو البحر المتوسط، على بعد 94 كيلومتر (58 ميل) من شمال الحدود الفلسطينيه اللبنانيه. يحد المدينه من الشرق سلسله جبال لبنان الغربيه؛ وهي تتخذ شكلا مثلثا، بسبب وقوعها بين وعلى تلتين: تل الاشرفيه وتل المصيطبه.\nتبلغ مساحه محافظه بيروت 18 كم² (6.9 ميل مربّع)، بينما تبلغ مساحه التجمع الحضري للمدينه 67 كم² (26 ميل مربّع).يعتبر الشاطئ البحري لبيروت متنوعا، فهو صخري في شمال المدينه، ورملي في جنوبها، وفي بعض الاقسام من الشمال يكون الشاطئ عباره عن اجراف صخريه مرتفعه، كذلك فان هذه النماذج جميعها يمكن ان تندمج سويا في بعض الاماكن، مثل نقطه التقاء شاطئ الروشه بشاطئ الرمله البيضاء.\n\nالمناخ\nالطقس في بيروت معتدل اجمالا، اذ يسود المناخ المتوسطي المتمثل بفصل صيف حار عالي الرطوبه، وربيع وخريف معتدلين، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يعتبر اغسطس اكثر شهور السنه حرّا، حيث يمكن ان يصل معدل الحراره الى 29 ° مئويه (84 ° فهرنهايت)، كما يعتبر شهرا يناير وفبراير اكثرها برودهً، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحراره في الشهر الى 10 ° مئويه (50 ° فهرنهايت). يكون اتجاه الرياح غربيّا خلال فتره بعد الظهر والمساء، اي انه يهب من البحر الى اليابسه، اما في الليل، يتغير الاتجاه الى الشرق، اي انه يهب من اليابسه نحو البحر.\nيبلغ معدل الامطار السنويه في بيروت 860 ميليمتر (34.1 انش) والتي يتساقط معظمها خلال اشهر الشتاء، والقليل منها يتساقط في الخريف والربيع. تتساقط معظم الامطار خلال عدد محدود من الايام بشكل كثيف في العاده، اما الثلج فيندر ان يتساقط في بيروت، وبحال تساقط فانه لا يتراكم، ويُستثنى من ذلك شتاء السنوات 1920، 1942، و1950، حيث هبّت ثلاث عواصف ثلجيه كبيره على لبنان ادت الى هطول الثلوج على الساحل.\n\nمناطق بيروت\nتُقسم بيروت الى 12 حيّاً معترفاً به:\n\nالاشرفيه: عُرفت بهذا الاسم منذ حوالي سبعمائه سنه، اطلقت بعض النصوص عليها اسم «مزرعه الاشرفيه»، وقد سُميت بذلك تيمنًا بالسلطان المملوكي الاشرف صلاح الدين خليل. تقع على الهضبه الشرقيه البيروتيّه، وتشتهر بانها منطقه راقيه.\nعين المريسه: يرجع اصل اسمها الى «الريّسه»، اي المرسى الصغير بصيغه «المرسه»، اي قطعه من الحبل، والعين التي هي الينبوع الصغير الذي يصب بالبحر.\nالباشوره: احدى اقدم المناطق في بيروت، يرتقي عهدها الى عصر الخليفه المنصور، وقد اشتهرت بوجود المقبره الاسلاميه فيها التي تفصل نحله السور بينها وبين بيروت القديمه. يعني اسمها: البرج المتعالي الذي يقع على مدخل القلاع والمدن.\nميناء الحصن: في الاساس كانت تُدعى «ميناء الحسن»، ثم حُرفت مع الوقت فصارت السين تُلفظ صادًا. يُحتمل انها حملت هذا الاسم لوجود برج حصن بيروت في المنطقه في قديم الزمان.\nالمزرعه: تيمنًا بالمزارع التي كانت قائمه بها قديمًا وابرزها مزارع الحمضيات من ليمون وبرتقال.\nالمدوّر: تيمنًا باحدى العائلات البيروتيه.\nالمصيطبه: اصل الاسم يرجع الى «مسطبه بيدمر»، كانت بريّه تقع خارج اسوار بيروت القديمه لحين تحرير المماليك للساحل الشامي من الصليبيين، فحينها امر السلطان الاشرف صلاح الدين خليل، امر بتحويل بيروت الى قاعده بحريه والانطلاق منها لاستعاده قبرص. فبدا قاده الجيش والجند يستقرون في تلك المنطقه الخاليه، ومع مرور الوقت استحالت قريه بحد ذاتها قبل ان تلتحم مع بيروت.\nالمرفا: تيمنًا بمرفا المدينه القديم الذي ما زال قائمًا في هذه المنطقه.\nراس بيروت: كانت منطقه مقفره من السكان، ولم يقطنها الا بعض المزارعين الذين كانوا يتعاطون زراعه التين والصبار. سًميت كذلك لان قسمًا منها، وهو القسم الذي يدخل البحر، يشبه الراس في تكوينه. اخذت المنطقه تصبح اهله بالسكان بعد بناء الكليه السوريه الانجيليه عام 1865، وعدد من المعاهد والكليّات الاجنبيه، فتوافد البيارته القدماء عليها، واستقروا هناك، وما لبث ان استقطبت المنطقه عدد من الاجانب ايضًا الذين اختلطوا مع اهل المدينه الاصليين.\nالرميل: احدى الاحياء القديمه في المدينه، كان حيًا شعبيًا في بادئ الامر قبل ان ينمو ويستحيل منطقه ارستقراطيه، خاصه بعد اعاده بناءه عند انتهاء الحرب الاهليه اللبنانيه.\nالصيفي: يشتهر هذا الحي بمطاعمه ومقاهيه عربيه الطابع، ونزله القديم التي تعود للعهدين العثماني والفرنسي، ومرابعه ونواديه الليليه الحديثه.\nزقاق البلاط: احد الاحياء المستحدثه في القرن التاسع عشر، بعد تطوّر مدينه بيروت واستحداثها عاصمه ولايه. سُمي كذلك تيمنًا بزقاق طويل رُصفت ارضه بالبلاط. كان هذا الحي ذو طابع ارستقراطي، اذ قطنه البيارته الميسورين والموظفين الحكوميين العثمانيين من اتراك وشركس وارمن، اما اليوم فيُعد حيًا شعبيًا ذو طابع تراثي. تميز هذا الحي وما زال بتنوعه العرقي والطائفي، فالكثير من سكانه ذوي جذور عربيه، وبعضهم تركي وكردي وارمني الاصل، واغلب السكّان مسلمون يتبعون المذهبين السني والشيعي، وهناك قسم من السكان مسيحي يتبع كنيستيّ الروم والارمن الارثوذكس، وكان هناك وجود في السابق لعده اسر يهوديه.\nويُقسّم كل من هذه الاحياء الى مناطق عقاريه متعدده. تقع ثلاثه مخيمات للاجئين الفلسطينيين في بيروت من اصل 12 مخيما رسميا في لبنان، وهذه المخيمات هي: مخيم برج البراجنه، مخيم شاتيلا، ومخيم مار الياس، وجميعها تقع جنوبي المدينه. ومن بين الخمس عشر مخيمًا الغير رسميّه في لبنان، فان واحد منها منها، وهو مخيم صبرا، يقع في بيروت، بالقرب من مخيم شاتيلا.\n\nسكان بيروت\nتختلف تقديرات عدد سكان بيروت بشكل واسع، فهي تصل بحسب بعض الاحصاءات الى 938,940 نسمه، بينما تصل بالنسبه لاحصاءات اخرى الى 1,303,129 نسمه، والى 2,012,000 نسمه بالنسبه للبعض الاخر. ان غياب العدد الصحيح لسكان بيروت يعود الى انه لم يتم اي تعداد رسمي للسكان في لبنان منذ سنه 1932.\n\nالتركيبه العرقيّه\nتُعد بيروت، كغيرها من مدن بلاد الشام الكبرى، مدينه ذات مزيج عرقي كبير، يظهر جليًا في اسماء والقاب العائلات والاسر التي تقطنها حاليًا. وسبب هذا المزيج هو الشعوب المختلفه التي مرّت على الشام ككل، واستقر البعض منها واختلط مع ابناء البلاد، لكن على الرغم من ذلك يبقى واضحًا طغيان عنصر معيّن على بقيّه العناصر، فغالبيه البيارته من مسلمين ومسيحيين، هم من اصول عربيه سواء من توطن منهم فيها قبل الفتح الاسلامي، او في ظل تلك الفتوح، كما شهدت بيروت موجات جديده من الهجرات العربيه سواء من المشرق العربي او من المغرب العربي. وقد شهد عهدا الخلافه العربيه بما فيها العهد الفاطمي والزنكي والايوبي والمملوكي والصليبي هجره الكثير من الاعاجم واستقرارهم في بيروت، وكذلك كان الحال في عهد الخلافه العثمانيه. كما شهدت القرون السابقه والقرن العشرين العديد من النزوح من المناطق اللبنانيه الى بيروت خاصهً.\n\nكانت بيروت قبيل الفتح الاسلامي ماهوله من قبل العرب والسريان والروم، وعندما فتح المسلمون الساحل الشامي شهدت المدينه قدوم العديد من العناصر العسكريه والمدنيه التي تنتمي الى قبائل عربيه، وقد توطنت في بيروت، ومنها من حافظت على اسماء قبائلها، في حين ان البعض الاخر اتخذ اسماء جديده هي عباره عن القاب وصفات ومهن، ومن القبائل العربيه التي استوطنت بيروت: بنو حزم وبنو مخزوم وبنو قيس وبنو زيدان، وسواهم، وتفرّعت منهم اسر عديده. من ابرز اصول البيارته المعاصرين الاصول المغربيه والاندلسيه، وقد بدا المغاربه والاندلسيين يتوافدون الى بلاد الشام ومدنها خلال العهد الصليبي، فقد انتقل الاف المغاربه من بلادهم الى الشام للمشاركه في الجهاد ضد الصليبيين، ووقع الكثير منهم اسرى، وقد حرص التجار والامراء والسلاطين المسلمين على فك اسرهم نظرًا لما قدّموه من تضحيات، ومنحوهم منحًا ماليه ووطنوهم في المدن وادخلوهم في حاشيتهم. كما ان قسمًا كبيرًا منهم اتى بغرض طلب العلم. اما القسم الاعظم من المغاربه والاندلسيين، فقد وصل بيروت عقب سقوط الاندلس سنه 1492، وعقب الاحتلال الفرنسي لبلدان المغرب اواخر القرن التاسع عشر، وطرد الكثير من السكّان بهدف توطين فرنسيين بدلاً منهم. كذلك يظهر جليًا الاصل المصري لبعض العائلات البيروتيه، من خلال تلقبها باسم المدينه او البلده التي وصلوا منها، مثل: الاسكندراني والرشيدي، والجيزي، واغلب البيارته ذوي الاصول المصريه وصلوا المدينه خلال عهد الحكم المصري لبلاد الشام. اما باقي الاسر البيروتيه ذات الجذور العربيه فاصولها عراقيه وشاميّه مجاوره وحجازيه ويمنيه.\n\nتعرضت بيروت ومختلف بلاد الشام لموجات هجره مدنيه وعسكريه في العهود الايوبيه والمملوكيه والعثمانيه، خاصه وان هذه العهود صاحبتها مجيء عشرات الالاف من العساكر المقاتله، بالاضافه الى ان حكّام وسلاطين هذه العهود كانوا يعمدون الى اسكان الجيوش بكثره في المناطق الخاضعه لهم للدفاع عنها وصبغها بلون واحد. وبناءً على ذلك تعرضت بيروت خلال تلك العهود لهجرات وموجات سكانيه تمازجت مع العائلات البيروتيه القديمه وتصاهرت معها، ومن ابرز الاعاجم الذين سكنوا بيروت: الاتراك والايرانيين والاكراد والشركس والالبان، واليونان، والارمن. ومن هذه العائلات من احتفظ باسمه الاصلي، واغلبها اتخذ اسماءً والقاب جديده تدل على اصوله مثل: الاصفهاني، والارناؤوط (من البانيا)، والبوشناق، وجركس، والمورللي، والكردي، والازمرلي، وغيرها. كذلك شهدت بيروت بعد انتهاء الحرب العالميه الاولى قدوم عساكر من مسلمي الهند قدموا مع الجيش البريطاني. وقد استقر بعضهم في بيروت وحملوا اسم عائله «الهندي». ايضًا هناك قلّه نادره من البيارته ترجع باصولها الى افريقيا جنوب الصحراء الكبرى، وهؤلاء يتحدرون من الرقيق الاسود، الذي كانت تجارته ناشطه الى نهايه الدوله العثمانيه، ومن الجنود السنغال الذين عملوا في الجيش الفرنسي طيله فتره الانتداب. وقد تمازج هؤلاء وتفاعلوا مع البيارته منذ اوائل القرن العشرين، لذلك فقد ضاعوا تقريبًا في المزيج البيروتي.\n\nالتركيبه الطائفيّه\nتعتبر بيروت اكثر مدن لبنان غنى بالتنوع الديني والمذهبي، ويُحتمل ايضا ان تكون اكثر مدن الشرق الاوسط غنى بهذا التنوع، اذ ان لكل من المسلمين والمسيحيين وجود فعّال فيها. هناك 9 طوائف رئيسيّه في بيروت هي: السنّه، الشيعه، الدروز، الموارنه، الروم الارثوذكس، الروم الكاثوليك، الارمن الارثوذكس، الارمن الكاثوليك، البروتستانت. يتولى الفصل في المنازعات والقضايا الدينيه، او قضايا الاحوال الشخصيه، القضاء الديني المختص بالنسبه لكل طائفه على حدى. ان المطالبه بالزواج المدني في لبنان قوبلت بالرفض من قبل رؤساء الطوائف الروحيه حتى الان، ولكن الحكومه تعترف بالزواج المدني الذي انعقد في الخارج. يعيش في بيروت حاليا عدد قليل من اليهود، ولكن في السابق كان هناك نسبه كبيره نسبيا من اليهود تسكن في حي وادي ابو جميل بوسط بيروت، ولا يزال الكنيس اليهودي قائما هناك حتى اليوم. ومن اثار اليهود الباقيه في بيروت ايضا المقبره اليهوديه الواقعه في القسم الشرقي من المدينه، والتي دُفن فيها ايضا بعض الجنود الفرنسيين الذين خدموا في لبنان ايام الانتداب.\nويتوزع سكان بيروت على الشكل التالي: مسلمون:65% (السنّه:80%، الشيعه:12%، الدروز:8%)، مسيحيون:30% (الموارنه:40%، الروم الارثوذكس:40%، الروم الكاثوليك:12%، الارمن:8%)، اقليات ويهود:5%.\nكان للحرب الاهليه اللبنانيه تاثير على ديمغرافيه السكان وتوزع الطوائف في بيروت، فقبل الحرب كانت الاحياء السكنيه اكثر اختلاطاً بالمذاهب المختلفه، اما اليوم فان كل قسم من بيروت يطغى عليه طابع معين، فبيروت الشرقيه اكثر سكانها مسيحيون، مع اقليّه سنيّه، بينما بيروت الغربيه اكثر سكانها مسلمون سنّه، وفيها اقليّه مسيحيه وشيعيّه. ويُلاحظ اليوم ان انتقال السكان المسيحيين والمسلمين من والى القسم الغربي والشرقي من المدينه عاد على نحو بسيط. يسكن ضاحيه بيروت الجنوبيه اكثريه شيعيّه، مع وجود اقليّه صغيره من السنّه والمسيحيين. كان لبيروت تاريخ من عدم الاستقرار السياسي كنتيجه للانقسامات الطائفيه، كما لعب الدين دوراً في السابق في تقسيم المجتمع اللبناني، كما يتضح من الحرب الاهليه الاخيره.\n\nاللاجئون والعمّال\nكان الارمن من اول اللاجئين الى بيروت في المرحله المعاصره، وبدا وصول الارمن الى لبنان سنه 1915 بعد ارتكاب المذابح بحقهم من قبل الاتراك، واول منطقه سكنوها كانت منطقه الكرنتينا ومن ثم برج حمود، حيث لا يزال المتحدرين منهم يقيمون هناك حتى اليوم. كانت بيروت احدى المدن الرئيسيه في لبنان التي سكنها اللاجئون الفلسطينيون سنه 1948، كذلك هناك عدد كبير من السوريين والمصريين الذين يقطنون المدينه ويعمل معظمهم في قطاع الخدمات والبناء. وبعد الغزو الامريكي للعراق سنه 2003، قدم لبنان حوالي 100,000 عراقي وسكن الكثير منهم في بيروت، الا ان الحكومه ابعدت قسرا جزءاً كبيرا منهم او قامت بسجنهم بسبب وصولهم بطريقه غير شرعيه.\nبالاضافه لذلك هناك عدد كبير من المهاجرين غير العرب في بيروت مثل الافغان، الايرانيين، والباكستانيين، كما شهدت السنوات الاخيره تزايدا في اعداد القادمين من الحبشه، وبلدان جنوب شرق اسيا، مثل اندونيسيا، الفلبين، ماليزيا، وسريلانكا، ويعمل هؤلاء في العاده كخدم في المنازل او المكاتب، والبعض يُباشر اعمالا خاصه به، مثل الايرانيين الذين يعملون اجمالا في صناعه السجاد العجمي.\n\nالخدمات الاقتصاديه والتجاريه والصناعيه والصحيه\nالاقتصاديه\nتستقطب مدينه بيروت رجال الاعمال من لبنانيين وعرب واجانب، وتتدفق الى مصارفها تحويلات من كل انحاء العالم. لذلك هي مركز مصرف لبنان وبورصته، وتحتل المركز المصرفي الاول في الشرق الاوسط، من هنا اتخذت مركزاً لاتحاد المصارف العربيه، وساعد في ذلك السريه المصرفيه التي يتبعها لبنان.\n\nالعمله والمصارف\nكان اللبنانيون عموما يتعاملون بالليره العثمانيه ايام الحكم العثماني، وكان الناس يرمزون الى العمله باسم «العثمليّه» او «الليره العثمليّه»، وخلال عهد الحكم المصري في لبنان (1831-1840)، وفي السنوات اللاحقه بعده، تعامل البيروتيين بالعمله المصريه، وكانوا يرمزون اليها «بالمصريه»، ومن هذه العمله اكتسبت النقود لفظتيّ «مصاري» و«مصريات» اللتين لا تزالان تستعملان حتى اليوم في بيروت وكافه انحاء لبنان وسوريا بمعنى نقود.\nبعد ان خضع لبنان للانتداب الفرنسي، اصدر الجنرال هنري غورو، المفوض السامي الفرنسي في سوريا ولبنان، نقدا خاصا لكلا البلدين، وقد حصر الاصدار «ببنك سوريا ولبنان»، وكان هذا المصرف فرنسيّا مقره باريس، وربطت حكومه الانتداب النقد اللبناني بالفرنك الفرنسي الذي كانت قيمته قد انخفضت كثيرا انذاك، وجعلت الليره وحده العمله اللبنانيه وقسمتها الى مائه قرش، وبهذا ظهرت الليره اللبنانيه. وبعد زوال الانتداب حصلت قطيعه اقتصاديه بين لبنان وسوريا بتاريخ 15 مارس 1950 بسبب تباين وجهات النظر الاقتصاديه بين الدولتين، فكان هذا حافزا للحكومه اللبنانيه كي تعيد تنظيم اقتصاد الدوله، فانشات في اوائل ستينات القرن العشرين «مصرف لبنان» او «البنك المركزي» الذي حلّ مكان بنك سوريا ولبنان في اصدار النقد اللبناني.\n\nنشطت حركه المصارف بسبب الازدهار الاقتصادي خلال فتره الستينات واوائل السبعينات، فبعد ان كان عدد المصارف لا يزيد عن عشره بعد الاستقلال، ارتفع في فتره الازدهار الى قرابه المئه، وقد اختيرت مدينه بيروت سنه 1974 مركزا لاتحاد المصارف العربيه، وتشجيعا لهذا القطاع الاقتصادي، اقرت الحكومه قانون السريه المصرفيه املهً في اجتذاب الودائع الكبيره من لبنان والبلاد العربيه، وقد اعطت هذه السياسه ثمارها وظهرت نتائجها في المبالغ الطائله التي اودعت في المصارف اللبنانيه في بيروت، والتي بلغت في بعض الاوقات ما يزيد عن 6 مليارات ليره. ومن المصارف التي تتخذ من بيروت مقرا رئيسيّا لها: بنك بيروت، بنك بلوم، بنك بيبلوس، بنك عوده، بنك لبنان والمهجر، بالاضافه لعدد من البنوك المشتركه مع بعض الدول العربيه مثل البنك اللبناني الكويتي والبنك اللبناني المصري، وغير العربيه كالبنك اللبناني الكندي، كما توجد بعض الفروع لمصارف اوروبيه مثل البنك البريطاني (HSBC).\nعلى الرغم من الازمه الاقتصاديه العالميه (2007 و2009 والمستمرّه حتى الان)، فان مصارف لبنان لم تتاثر بها بشكل يذكر، وبالتالي فان قيمه الليره اللبنانيه بقيت مستقره نسبيّا، ويعود ذلك الى الاجراءات الصارمه التي تتبع عند منح القروض وغيرها من المدفوعات، والتي نصّ عليها وفرضها حاكم مصرف لبنان، رياض سلامه. حصل الاخير على جائزه «افضل حاكم مصرف مركزي لسنه 2009»، كونه كان قادرا على منع وصول الاثار السلبيه للازمه الاقتصاديه العالميه الى لبنان، كما كان قد حصل على نفس الجائزه سنه 2006.\n\nبورصه بيروت\nبورصه بيروت هي سوق الاوراق الماليه الوحيده العامله في لبنان. تعتبر بورصه بيروت واحده من اقدم الاسواق الماليه في المنطقه حيث يعود تاريخ تاسيسها لسنه 1920، تحت سلطه الانتداب الفرنسي، وكانت ثاني اقدم سوق ماليه في العالم العربي. وفي اوائل الخمسينات تميز، الاقتصاد اللبناني بنشاط ملحوظ حيث بدات شركات صناعيه ومصرفيه وخدماتيه تدخل البورصه لتجعل من بورصه بيروت افضل سوق مالي في المنطقه مع دخول حوالي خمسين شركه. مع اندلاع الاحداث اللبنانيه سنه 1975 تراجعت حركه التداول في بورصه بيروت، ومع تدهور الوضع الامني، علق العمل في البورصه من سنه 1983، ولم تعاود نشاطها حتى 22 ديسمبر 1996، اي بعد 13 عاما. في نهايه سنه 2006 اطلقت بورصه بيروت نظام تداول جديد عن بعد، يسمح للوسطاء بتداول الصكوك المدرجه على بورصه بيروت عن بعد من مكاتبهم الخاصه. وفي 13 فبراير 2008 قررت البورصه الاجازه باعتماد التداول الالكتروني «عن بعد» على بورصه بيروت عبر الانترنت وذلك حصراً من خلال شركات الوساطه المعتمده في البورصه. تقع بورصه بيروت اليوم في وسط المدينه التجاري، بعد ان نُقل مقرها الى هناك سنه 2002.\n\nمرفا بيروت\nتعد بيروت مركزًا لاحد اهم واكبر الموانئ الواقعه شرق البحر المتوسط وهو مرفا بيروت؛ حيث ان موقعه وعمق المياه فيه يتيح له ان يستقبل اكبر المراكب وسفن الشحن. فقد ظهر ان القسم المخصص منه لتخزين الحاويات كان يعمل ويحوي ما يزيد عن العدد العادي الذي يُفترض به ان يحويه، لاكثر من 10 سنوات، قبل ان تظهر الدراسات انه يقدر ان يحوي هذا المقدار. كما وتوجد المقرات الرئيسيّه للعديد من المصارف والشركات اللبنانيه في بيروت، وبعض فروع الاجنبيه منها.\n\nالخدمات التجاريه\nتشكل التجاره جزءاً من طبيعه البيروتيين الذين اكتشفوا منذ القدم اهميه موقع مدينتهم المرفئيه، كجمال التقاء بين الشرق والغرب يتمتع بميزات تسهم في انجاح المبادرات التجاريه على اختلافها. فغدت بيروت مركزاً مالياً وتجارياً وصناعياً مرموقاً يتعاطى جميع النشاطات الماليه والخدمات المصرفيه بالاضافه الى نشاطات اخرى متعدده في قطاعات البناء والتجاره والاستيراد والتصدير والصناعه.\nوتتمركز في بيروت المؤسسات الاقتصاديه والتجاريه الكبرى لتامين الخدمات واستثمار المشاريع الانشائيه، ما وفر العمل للعديد من اللبنانيين، وجلب العديد من المستهلكين اليها، وقد ساعد في ذلك اعتماد لبنان النظام الراسمالي الحر، واقراره قانون السريه المصرفيه وتوسيع وتطوير كل من مطار بيروت الدولي ومرفا بيروت والمنطقه الحره في كل من هذين المرفقين الحيويين الذين يعتبران عن حق بدايه الشرق ومنفذاً للدول العربيه على البحر المتوسط، وجسر الغرب الصناعي للشرق الاستهلاكي.\n\nجمعيّه تجّار بيروت\nتاسست جمعيه تجـار بيروت سنه 1921 واعترف بها رسـمياً بموجب رخصـه رسـميه مؤرخه في ابريل 1921. وكان الهدف الاساسي للمؤسسين العمل على توحيد جهود التجار في مدينه بيروت والتي كانت ركن الاساس للتجاره اللبنانيه، وتنسيق مساعيهم في خدمه مهنتهم والاعتناء بالوسائل التي من شانها حمايه التجاره اللبنانيه وتشجيعها ورفع مستواها والدفاع عن مصالحها ومصالح اعضائها والعمل على تقدمها وتقدمهم من جميع النواحي الاقتصاديه، والعمل على ايجاد المشاريع التجاريه وتنشيطها على اختلاف انواعها والسعي لتعزيز مدينه بيروت الاقتصادي وانشاء مكتب للاستعلامات التجاريه وناد لتعارف التجار توثيقاً للروابط بينهم والتوسط لدى السلطات الرسميه والدوائر الحكوميه لرفع كل حيف يقع عليهم والعمل لكل ما يعود بالنفع على الجمعيه عموماً.\n\nالخدمات الصناعيه\nتتمركز في بيروت وضواحيها 66% من المؤسسات الصناعيه اللبنانيه نظراً الى سهوله الحصول على المواد الاوليه عبر مرفا بيروت بالاضافه الى توافر اليد العامله.\n\nالخدمات الصحيه\nفي بيروت اهم المستشفيات اللبنانيه واكثرها تجهيزاً وكفايه معظم الجهاز الطبي اللبناني، فضلاً عن المستوصفات والصيدليات ومستودعات الادويه. اشتهرت في الماضي بانها مستشفى العرب، وبعد الحرب عادت تدريجياً الى موقعها المرموق وياتي اليها العديد من العرب خصوصاً للحصول على الطبابه المميزه. ومن ابرز مستشفيات بيروت: مستشفى الجامعه الاميركيه، مستشفى رزق، مستشفى اوتيل ديو، ومستشفى المقاصد.\n\nبيروت الرسميه\nيقع البرلمان اللبناني في العاصمه بيروت، وكذلك السراي الكبير، مقر الحكومه. تحوي بيروت ايضا جميع الوزارات ومعظم الادارات الرسميّه، السفارات والقنصليات. بيروت هي احدى المحافظات السته اللبنانيه، والخمسه الاخرى هي: البقاع، لبنان الشمالي، لبنان الجنوبي، جبل لبنان، والنبطيه.\n\nبلديّه بيروت\nتتكون بلديه بيروت من مجلس البلديّه ولجان ذلك المجلس. يتالف مجلس البلديه من رئيس البلديه ونائبه واعضاء المجلس البالغ عددهم 24 شخصا. اما لجان المجلس فقد حدد القانون عددها بست عشره لجنه هي: لجنه المناقصات، لجنه المال والاداره، لجنه متابعه مقررات المجلس البلدي، اللجنه القانونيه، لجنه الحدائق والصحه والبيئه، لجنه التخطيط والاشغال والاملاك والاستملاكات، لجنه الاعلام والعلاقات العامه، لجنه تسميه الشوارع والسير والاناره والنقل، لجنه الشؤون الاجتماعيه والثقافيه والرياضيه، ولجنه المؤسسات المصنفه. يشمل الجدول ادناه اسماء محافظو بيروت من عام 1936 الى الوقت الحاضر: كامل عبّاس حميّه (1936 – 1941)، نقولا رزق الله (1946 – 1952)، جورج عاصي (1952 – 1956)، بشّور حدّاد (1956 – 1958)، فيليب بولس (1959 – 1960)، اميل ينّي (1960 – 1967)، شفيق ابو حيدر (1967 – 1977)، متري النمّار (1977 – 1987)، جورج سماحه (1987 – 1991)، نايف المعلوف (1992 – 1995)، نقولا سابا (1995 – 1999)، يعقوب الصرّاف (1999 – 2005)، ناصيف قالوش (2005 – 2014)، زياد شبيب (2014 –).\n\nالمنظمات الدوليه\nتتخذ بعض المنظمات الدوليه من بيروت مقرّاً لها، ومن ذلك لجنه الامم المتحده الاقتصاديه والاجتماعيه لغربي اسيا (الاسكوا، ESCWA) المتمركزه في وسط بيروت التجاري. وكذلك فهناك مكاتب اقليميه في المدينه لكل من منظمه العمل الدوليه (ILO)، ومنظمه الامم المتحده للتربيه والعلم والثقافه (اليونسكو، UNESCO)، والتي تغطي كافه انحاء العالم العربي. بالاضافه لذلك، يقع المقر الرئيسي للاتحاد العربي للنقل الجوي (AACO) في بيروت ايضاً.\n\nالتعليم\nالتعليم الاساسي\nينتشر في بيروت عدد من المدارس الخاصه، ومن اشهرها: الانترناشونال كولدج، بيروت (الكليّه العالميه في بيروت، IC)، كليه لويس فاغمان، مدرسه الجاليه الاميركيه في بيروت، ثانويه الروضه، كليه السيده الارثوذكسيه، الكليه الفرنسيه البروتستانتيه (بالفرنسيه: Collège Protestant Français)، مدرسه القلب الاقدس - الجميّزه (بالفرنسيه: Collège du Sacré-Coeur Gemmayzé)، الثانويه الفرنسيه اللبنانيه الكبرى (بالفرنسيه: Grand Lycée Franco-Libanais). كذلك هناك بعض الجمعيّات الخيريهّ التي تُنشا المدارس الخاصه مثل جمعيه المقاصد الخيريه الاسلاميه، والتي انشات عدّه مدارس خاصه في بيروت بقي منها 8 اليوم، ومن اهمها كليه المقاصد للبنات وكليه خالد بن الوليد.\n\nيعتمد انتقال الطالب الى مرحله التعليم العالي على حصوله على شهاده البكالوريا اللبنانيه، ولكن يُقبل ايضا بالبكالوريا الفرنسيه، باعتبار انه تمت مساواتها بتلك اللبنانيه، ويحصل الشخص على هذه الشهاده عن طريق نجاحه في امتحانات الثانويه العامه الرسميه. تعتبر البكالوريا الفنيه او المهنيه بديلا عن تلك العاديه بالنسبه لمن درس في المعاهد الفنيه.\n\nالتعليم العالي\nيؤمن التعليم العالي في بيروت، وجميع انحاء لبنان، عدد من المعاهد المهنيه ومؤسسات التعليم العادي، مثل الكليّات الجامعيه، المؤسسات الجامعيه، والجامعات. ومن بين كل صروح العلم هذه المنتشره عبر الدوله، فان الجامعه اللبنانيه هي مؤسسه التعليم العالي الرسميّه الوحيده التي تقع في العاصمه. تُدار جميع الكليّات والجامعات في بيروت ولبنان من قبل وزاره التربيه والتعليم العالي، ويعتبر الوزير المختص مسؤولا عن وضع البرامج التعليميه وتقرير موعد الامتحانات الرسميّه وصيانه هذه المؤسسات والحفاظ عليها بشكل عام.\nهناك عدد كبير من الطلاب الاجانب الذين يكملون دراساتهم العليا في بيروت، واكثرهم من الخليج العربي وسوريا والعراق، والبعض من ايران واوروبا، وينبغي على اي اجنبي من الذين يرغبون بمتابعه تعليمهم العالي في لبنان ان يستوفي المؤهلات المطلوبه في اللبنانيين انفسهم، فيجب اولا ان تكون شهادته الثانويه معادله للبكالوريا اللبنانيه كي يسمح له بالتسجيل في اي مؤسسه تعليم عالي. لا يخضع الطلاب الاجانب لاي نظام محاصصه، وتُقدم الحكومه المنح الدراسيّه ضمن نطاق الاتفاقات الثانئيه التي عُقدت مع الدوله الام للطالب الاجنبي او الدوله التي يرغب الطالب اللبناني بالتعلّم فيها. وعند حصول اي لبناني او اجنبي على شهاده اجنبيه، فانه يجب التصديق عليها من قبل السفاره اللبنانيه في ذلك البلد ووزاره الخارجيه في لبنان، ومن ثم يبقى على الاجنبي المرشح للدخول في المؤسسه التعليميه ان يذهب بنفسه ومعه المستندات المطلوبه لاكمال اجراءات التسجيل في الجامعه او المعهد الذي ينشده.\nتعتبر بيروت مركزا لبعض اهم واشهر الجامعات في الشرق الاوسط، مثل الجامعه الاميركيه في بيروت، جامعه القديس يوسف، المعهد العالي للاعمال، والجامعه اللبنانيه الاميركيه، وبعض الجامعات والكليّات ذات الاهميه المحليه مثل جامعه بيروت العربيه، والجامعه الاميركيه للعلوم والتكنولوجيا.\n\nالعمران\nان النظام المعماري في بيروت في العهد العثماني يعتبر من اجمل ملامح التراث البيروتي واللبناني والعربي والعثماني، وتشهد الاثار العُثمانيّه المتبقيه من منازل ودور وقصور وسرايات وثكن ومدارس ومساجد، جمال وروعه هذا التراث. وعلى سبيل المثال فان النشاطات الاقتصاديّه كانت ممثله بالاسواق التجاريّه والصناعيّه والحرفيّه، من بين هذه الاسواق على سبيل المثال والتي كانت قائمه منذ العهد العُثماني: سوق الاساكفه، سوق البازركان، سوق العطارين، سوق الحدادين، وكثير غيرها. كانت بيوت البيارته في تلك الفتره متواضعه بشكل عام، سقوفها مدعمه بالجسور الخشبيّه، وكان يصعد الى الطابق العلوي بواسطه سلم حجر داخلي وسلم حجر خارجي، علماً ان بعض البيوت الاخرى كانت سلالمها مصنوعه من الاخشاب، اما المساطب فكانت نمطاً معمارياً تقليدياً موجود امام بيوت بيروت كافه، كما وجدت في بيروت القديمه وفي ضواحيها القريبه بعض البيوت المتواضعه التي بنيت كلها من الخشب، وكانت تبطن الجدران الخشبيه بصفائح من القصدير او الزنك لمنع الهواء من الدخول الى المنازل.\n\nوبشكل عام فان بيروت في القرن التاسع عشر كانت تتميز بمنازل سقوفها من القرميد الاحمر الموضوع فوق السقوف الخشبيه، وبغرف واسعه ذات سقوف عاليه، وايوان جميل متسع يُسمّى المنزول وهو ما يُعرف حاليّا بالصالون او غرفه الاستقبال. وكان يتخلل المنازل شبابيك شرعيّه، وفتحات زجاجيّه مرتفعه مصنوعه من الزجاج الملون وفي غالبيه منازل بيروت شرفات في الطابق الاول، في اعلاها فتحات زجاجيّه مصنوعه من الزجاج الملّون، كما يتخلل الغرف بعض فتحات التهوئه، وكانت المنازل البيروتيّه تضّم عاده عليّه التي تُعرف محليا باسم «المتخّت» او «التتخيته» التي يعلوها عاده القافعه التي يصعد منها الى سطح المنزل، حيث السطيحه التي يظللها العرزال ومسابك زهور الفل والزنبق والرياحين والياسمين.\nوفي فتره لاحقه تاثر البيروتيين بنمط العماره الاوروبي، فاخذت البيوت ذات طابع العماره الايطاليه والفرنسيه تنتشر بالمدينه شيئا فشيئا حتى استبدلت الكثير من المباني ذات الطابع العربي او العثماني. وفي فتره لاحقه، ومع ازدياد الكثافه السكانيه، اخذ الناس يبنون العمارات المتعدده الطوابق فحلت مكان معظم الابنيه التقليديه لدرجه ان اي حي سكني به عماره قديمه من ايام العثمانيين والفرنسيين تصنفه البلديه على انه «حي ذو طابع تراثي». وبعد انتهاء الحرب الاهليه، قامت شركه «سوليدير» باعاده بناء وسط المدينه المدمر، فبنت معظم المناطق السكنيه في تلك المنطقه على الطراز الاوروبي.\n\nمعالم المدينه\nالمواصلات\nان استعمال وسائل المواصلات حاجه ضروريه يوميه بالنسبه لكل من يسكن المدينه او خارجها، على الرغم من صغر حجمها. تُقسّم وسائل النقل في بيروت الى مواصلات بريه، بحريه، وجويّه.\n\nالمواصلات البريه\nتتصل بيروت بغيرها من المدن اللبنانيه والمدن السوريه الرئيسيّه، عن طريق الحافلات التي يتبع كل منها شبكه طرقات معينه في تنقله. وتتمركز الحافلات التي تنقل الركاب الى شمال لبنان وسوريا في محطه شارل حلو الواقعه في شمال بيروت. وفي بيروت شركتين رئيسيتين تقدم خدمات النقل للمواطنين: الاولى هي الشركه اللبنانيه للمواصلات (LCC)، وهي شركه خاصه تؤمن النقل بداخل المدينه وبعض الضواحي، وهي تتبع 10 طرقات رئيسيّه تغطي معظم المنطقه المركزيه لبيروت. اما الشركه الثانيه، فهي مصلحه سكك الحديد والنقل المشترك، وهي شركه عامّه، تتبع حافلاتها 12 خطّا رئيسيّا في المدينه.\nبالاضافه الى الحافلات، التي تستخدمها طبقه واسعه من الشعب وخصوصا ابناء الطبقات الفقيره بسبب التعرفه البخسه، تنتشر في بيروت سيارات الاجره والسرفيس، والاخيره عباره عن اجره ارخص بكثير من الاجره العاديه، وتعرفتها محدده مسبقا، وهي تصل حاليّا في بيروت الى 100,000 ليره لبنانيه، والغالب ان يستقل الناس سياره الاجره باعتبار انها «سرفيس»، ولتفادي اي سوء تفاهم فقد جرت العاده على ان يخبر الراكب السائق بالمكان الذي يقصده، فاذا كان بعيدا تعتبر الاجره عاديّه، وان كان ضمن حدود المدينه تعتبر «سرفيس». كذلك تُستعمل الميكروباصات في نقل الافراد من بيروت الى بعض البلدات والقرى والمدن اللبنانيه.\nوفي فتره سابقه، كان الترامواي ايضا يؤدي خدمه النقل بداخل المدينه، وقد جرى الاحتفال بتدشين خط الترامواي ببيروت في شهر سبتمبر سنه 1907 بمناسبه المولد السلطاني للعام الثامن والتسعين، وكان ذلك في عهد الوالي ابراهيم خليل باشا.، وتوقف العمل به في مايو 1964، بعد ان اصدرت الحكومه قرارها بذلك، وسيّرت الحافلات بدلا منه، بعد ان درّبت سائقي الترامواي على قياده السيارات الجديده.\n\nالمواصلات البحريه\nان مرفا بيروت هو اكبر مرافئ لبنان واحد اهم المرافئ الواقعه شرق البحر المتوسط، وهو فضلا عن استقباله المراكب والسفن التجاريه، يستقبل العبّارات التي يمكن الانتقال فيها من والى قبرص والمرافئ اللبنانيه الاخرى بالاضافه للمرافئ السوريه والمصريه وغيرها من المرافئ المجاوره.\n\nالمواصلات الجويّه\nيقع مطار بيروت رفيق الحريري الدولي في الضاحيه الجنوبيه للمدينه، ويتصل بوسط العاصمه عبر طريق المطار. وقد تم افتتاحه سنه 1954، وفي هذه الفتره كان يُعرف بمطار بيروت الدولي، وقد تعرض المطار على مر السنين لعدد من العوائق كان ابرزها الحرب الاهليه اللبنانيه التي اوقفت جميع عمليات السفر تقريبا وادت لتدمير منشاته وتوقفه عن العمل، وبعد انتهاء الحرب قام رئيس الوزراء انذاك، رفيق الحريري باعاده بنائه، وبعد استشهاد الاخير سُمي المطار على اسمه. يتعامل المطار مع 47 شركه طيران عربيه وعالميه و8 شركات شحن جوي.\n\nالثقافه\nتعتبر ثقافه بيروت الحاليه مزيجا من ثقافات متنوعه ومتعدده لمختلف الشعوب والحضارات التي مرّت على المدينه، بما فيها اليونانيون والرومان (ثقافه حوض البحر المتوسط)، العرب والاتراك (ثقافه عربيه اسلاميه)، والفرنسيون (ثقافه اوروبيه). يُعتقد ان مدرسه الحقوق التي انشات في المدينه ايام الامبراطوريه الرومانيه كانت اول مدرسه قانون في العالم. ان تاريخ الكوسموبوليتيه هذا يعد مصدر فخر للبنانيين عموما والبيروتيين خصوصا.\nاستضافت بيروت قمه الفرانكوفونيه وجامعه الدول العربيه سنه 2002، وحفل تقديم جائزه البير لوندر، الذي يقدم جوائز للصحافيين الفرانكوفونيين المميزين كل سنه. استضافت المدينه ايضا الالعاب الفرانكوفونيه في عام 2009. تعتبر بيروت عاصمه الكتاب العالميه للامم المتحده لسنه 2009، تقديرا لغناها الثقافي.\n\nاللكنه\nاللكنه البيروتيه هي احدى فروع اللهجه اللبنانيه. وهي لكنه عربيه اصيله ما تزال ملامحها وصفاتها متجذره حتى اليوم في المجتمع البيروتي، ويُلاحظ ان اللهجات المغاربيه تبرز بين الحين والاخر في اللكنه البيروتيه لا سيما اللهجه التونسيه، ولهجه الشلوح سكان بلاد السوس وجبال الاطلس في المغرب الاقصى، ولهجه تمازرت وهي لهجه سكان الاطلس المتوسط، واللهجه الزناتيه لهجه سكان الريف في الشمال، فضلاً عن لهجات الجزائر وليبيا. علمًا ان الكثير من ملامح اللكنه البيروتيه بدات تزول بسبب «التفرنج» في الكلام، ومع اقتحام العادات والتقاليد الغربيه المنازل والشوارع والاسواق والمدارس والجامعات، واجهزه الاعلام المتنوعه. ومن سمات لهجه العائلات البيروتيه على سبيل المثال: تحويل السين صادًا، مثل: البسطه == البصطه، وتحويل الجيم الى شين، مثال ذلك: الحرج = الحرش، اجتماع == اشتماع. فضلاً على ان اللهجه الخليجيه التي انتقلت مع الفتوحات الاسلاميه الى المغرب العربي ثم ارتدت مجددًا الى المشرق تظهر واضحه في اسماء بعض العائلات، مثل: بعيون؛ اي: ابو العيون، من با عيون.\n\nالمتاحف\nيعتبر متحف بيروت الوطني المتحف الاساسي للاثار في لبنان، وهو يحوي قرابه 1300 قطعه حرفيه اثريّه يتراوح تاريخها من فتره عصور ما قبل التاريخ وصولا الى العهد المملوكي في العصور الوسطى. وبالاضافه للمتحف الوطني، يعتبر متحف الجامعه الاميركيه في بيروت للاثار ثالث اقدم متحف في الشرق الاوسط، وهو يعرض مجموعه كبيره من الحرفيات التي عُثر عليها في لبنان وبعض الدول المجاوره.\nكذلك يوجد متحف سرسق او قصر سرسق الذي يحوي اليوم اكثر الاعمال الفنيه شهره في بيروت، وهي تتمثل في مجموعه من المنحوتات اليابانيه وعدّه اعمال فنيه اسلاميه، كما ويستضيف هذا المتحف معارض مؤقته خلال السنه. وبالقرب من السراي الكبير يقع متحف روبير معوّض الخاص الذي تُعرض فيه المجموعه الخاصه بهاوي الفن والسياسي اللبناني هنري فرعون، من تحف وقطع اثريه. كما ويوجد متحف علمي خاص بالاطفال هو «بلانت ديسكفري» (كوكب الاكتشاف)،
