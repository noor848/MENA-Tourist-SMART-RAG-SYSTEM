          "content": "Beirut (  bay-ROOT; Arabic: بيروت, romanized: ) is the capital and largest city of Lebanon. As of 2014, Greater Beirut has a population of 2.5 million, just under half of Lebanon's population, which makes it the twelfth-largest city in the Levant region and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world. The city is situated on a peninsula at the midpoint of Lebanon's Mediterranean coast. Beirut has been inhabited for more than 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world.\nBeirut is Lebanon's seat of government and plays a central role in the Lebanese economy, with many banks and corporations based in the city. Beirut is an important seaport for the country and region, and rated a Beta- World City by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Beirut was severely damaged by the Lebanese Civil War, the 2006 Lebanon War, and the 2020 massive explosion in the Port of Beirut, and was subsequently rebuilt after each of these events. Its architectural and demographic structure underwent major change in recent decades.\n\nEtymology\nThe English name Beirut is an early transcription of the Arabic name Bayrūt (بيروت). The same name's transcription into French is Beyrouth, which was sometimes used during Lebanon's French mandate. The Arabic name derives from Phoenician bēʾrūt (𐤁𐤀‏𐤓𐤕‎ bʾrt). This was a modification of the Phoenician word bīʾrōt later bēʾrūt, meaning \"wells\", in reference to the site's accessible water table. The name is first attested in the 14th century BC, when it was mentioned in three Akkadian cuneiform tablets of the Amarna letters, letters sent by King Ammunira of Biruta to Amenhotep III or Amenhotep IV of Egypt. Biruta was also mentioned in the Amarna letters from King Rib-Hadda of Byblos.\nThe Greeks hellenised the name as Bērytós (Ancient Greek: Βηρυτός), which the Romans latinised as Berytus. When it attained the status of a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and its official name was emended to Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus to include its imperial sponsors.\nAt the time of the crusades, the city was known in French as Barut or Baruth.\n\nHistory\nThe earliest settlement of Beirut was on an island in the Beirut River, but the channel that separated it from the banks silted up and the island ceased to be. Excavations in the downtown area have unearthed layers of Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Crusader, Persian and Ottoman remains.\n\nPrehistory\nBeirut was settled over 5,000 years ago, and there is evidence that the surrounding area had already been inhabited for tens of thousands of years prior to this. Several prehistoric archaeological sites have been discovered within the urban area of Beirut, revealing flint tools from sequential periods dating from the Middle Palaeolithic and Upper Paleolithic through the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.\nBeirut I (Minet el-Hosn) was listed as \"the town of Beirut\" (French: Beyrouth ville) by Louis Burkhalter and said to be on the beach near the Orient and Bassoul hotels on the Avenue des Français in central Beirut. The site was discovered by Lortet in 1894 and discussed by Godefroy Zumoffen in 1900. The flint industry from the site was described as Mousterian and is held by the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon.\nBeirut II (Umm el-Khatib) was suggested by Burkhalter to have been south of Tarik el Jedideh, where P.E. Gigues discovered a Copper Age flint industry at around 100 metres (328 feet) above sea level. The site had been built on and destroyed by 1948.\nBeirut III (Furn esh-Shebbak), listed as Plateau Tabet, was suggested to have been located on the left bank of the Beirut River. Burkhalter suggested that it was west of the Damascus road, although this determination has been criticized by Lorraine Copeland. P. E. Gigues discovered a series of Neolithic flint tools on the surface along with the remains of a structure suggested to be a hut circle. Auguste Bergy discussed polished axes that were also found at this site, which has now completely disappeared as a result of construction and urbanization of the area.\nBeirut IV (Furn esh-Shebbak, river banks) was also on the left bank of the river and on either side of the road leading eastwards from the Furn esh Shebbak police station towards the river that marked the city limits. The area was covered in red sand that represented Quaternary river terraces. The site was found by Jesuit Father Dillenseger and published by fellow Jesuits Godefroy Zumoffen, Raoul Describes and Auguste Bergy. Collections from the site were made by Bergy, Describes and another Jesuit, Paul Bovier-Lapierre. Many Middle Paleolithic flint tools were found on the surface and in side gullies that drain into the river. They included around 50 varied bifaces accredited to the Acheulean period, some with a lustrous sheen, now held at the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. Henri Fleisch also found an Emireh point amongst material from the site, which has now disappeared beneath buildings.\nBeirut V (Nahr Beirut, Beirut River) was discovered by Dillenseger and said to be in an orchard of mulberry trees on the left bank of the river, near the river mouth, and to be close to the railway station and bridge to Tripoli. Levallois flints and bones and similar surface material were found amongst brecciated deposits. The area has now been built on.\nBeirut VI (Patriarchate) was a site discovered while building on the property of the Lebanese Evangelical School for Girls in the Patriarchate area of Beirut. It was notable for the discovery of a finely styled Canaanean blade javelin suggested to date to the early or middle Neolithic periods of Byblos and which is held in the school library.\nBeirut VII, the Rivoli Cinema and Byblos Cinema sites near the Bourj in the Rue el Arz area, are two sites discovered by Lorraine Copeland, Peter Wescombe, and Marina Hayek in 1964 and examined by Diana Kirkbride and Roger Saidah. One site was behind the parking lot of the Byblos Cinema and showed collapsed walls, pits, floors, charcoal, pottery and flints. The other, overlooking a cliff west of the Rivoli Cinema, was composed of three layers resting on limestone bedrock. Fragments of blades and broad flakes were recovered from the first layer of black soil, above which some Bronze Age pottery was recovered in a layer of grey soil. Pieces of Roman pottery and mosaics were found in the upper layer. Middle Bronze Age tombs were found in this area, and the ancient tell of Beirut is thought to be in the Bourj area.\n\nPhoenician period\nThe Phoenician port of Beirut was located between Rue Foch and Rue Allenby on the north coast. The port or harbour was excavated and reported on several years ago and now lies buried under the city. Another suggested port or dry dock was claimed to have been discovered around 1 kilometre (0.62 miles) to the west in 2011 by a team of Lebanese archaeologists from the Directorate General of Antiquities of Lebanese University. Controversy arose on 26 June 2012 when authorization was given by Lebanese Minister of Culture Gaby Layoun for a private company called Venus Towers Real Estate Development Company to destroy the ruins (archaeological site BEY194) in the $500 million construction project of three skyscrapers and a garden behind Hotel Monroe in downtown Beirut. Two later reports by an international committee of archaeologists appointed by Layoun, including Hanz Curver, and an expert report by Ralph Pederson, a member of the institute of Nautical Archaeology and now teaching in Marburg, Germany, dismissed the claims that the trenches were a port, on various criteria. The exact function of site BEY194 may never be known, and the issue raised heated emotions and led to increased coverage on the subject of Lebanese heritage in the press.\n\nHellenistic period\nIn 140 BC, the Phoenician city was destroyed by Diodotus Tryphon during his conflict with Antiochus VII Sidetes for the throne of the Hellenistic Seleucid monarchy. Laodicea in Phoenicia was built upon the same site on a more conventional Hellenistic plan. Present-day Beirut overlies this ancient one, and little archaeology was carried out until after the civil war in 1991. The salvage excavations after 1993 have yielded new insights into the layout and history of this period of Beirut's history. Public architecture included several areas and buildings.\nMid-1st-century coins from Berytus bear the head of Tyche, goddess of fortune; on the reverse, the city's symbol appears: a dolphin entwines an anchor. This symbol was later taken up by the early printer Aldus Manutius in 15th century Venice. After a state of civil war and decline the Seleucid Empire faced, King Tigranes the Great of the Kingdom of Armenia conquered Beirut and placed it under effective Armenian control. However, after the Battle of Tigranocerta, Armenia forever lost their holdings in Syria and Beirut was conquered by Roman general Pompey.\n\nRoman period\nLaodicea was conquered by Pompey in 64 BC and the name Berytus was restored to it. The city was assimilated into the Roman Empire, soldiers were sent there, and large building projects were undertaken. From the 1st century BC, the Bekaa Valley served as a source of grain for the Roman provinces of the Levant and even for Rome itself. Under Claudius, Berytus expanded to reach the Bekaa Valley and include Heliopolis (Baalbek). The city was settled by Roman colonists who promoted agriculture in the region.\nAs a result of this settlement, the city quickly became Romanized, and the city became the only mainly Latin-speaking area in the Syria-Phoenicia province. In 14 BC, during the reign of Herod the Great, Berytus became a colony, one of four in the Syria-Phoenicia region and the only one with full Italian rights (ius Italicum) exempting its citizens from imperial taxation. Beirut was considered the most Roman city in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the veterans of two Roman legions were established in the city of Berytus by emperor Augustus: the 5th Macedonian and the 3rd Gallic Legions.\nBerytus's law school was widely known; two of Rome's most famous jurists, Papinian and Ulpian, were natives of Phoenicia and taught there under the Severan emperors. Ecclesiastical historian Sozomen studied at the law school in Beirut between 400 and 402. When Justinian assembled his Pandects in the 6th century, a large part of the corpus of laws was derived from these two jurists, and in AD 533 Justinian recognised the school as one of the three official law schools of the empire.\nIn 551, a major earthquake struck Berytus, causing widespread damage. The earthquake reduced cities along the coast to ruins and killed many, 30,000 in Berytus alone by some measurements. As a result, the students of the law school were transferred to Sidon.\nSalvage excavations since 1993 have yielded new insights in the layout and history of Roman Berytus. Public architecture included several bath complexes, Colonnaded Streets, a circus and theatre; residential areas were excavated in the Garden of Forgiveness, Martyrs' Square and the Beirut Souks.\n\nMiddle Ages\nBeirut was conquered by the Muslims in 635. As a trading center of the eastern Mediterranean, Beirut was as important as Acre (in modern-day Israel) during the Middle Ages. From 1110 to 1291, the town and Lordship of Beirut was part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The city was taken by Saladin in 1187 and recaptured in 1197 by Henry I of Brabant as part of the German Crusade of 1197. John of Ibelin, known as the Old Lord of Beirut, was granted the lordship of the city in 1204. He rebuilt the city after its destruction by the Ayyubids and also built the House of Ibelin palace in Beirut.\n\nIn 1291 Beirut was captured and the Crusaders expelled by the Mamluk army of Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil.\n\nOttoman rule\nUnder the Ottoman sultan Selim I (1512–1520), the Ottomans conquered Syria including present-day Lebanon. Beirut was controlled by local Druze emirs throughout the Ottoman period. One of them, Fakhr-al-Din II, fortified it early in the 17th century, but the Ottomans reclaimed it in 1763. With the help of Damascus, Beirut successfully broke Acre's monopoly on Syrian maritime trade and for a few years supplanted it as the main trading center in the region. During the succeeding epoch of rebellion against Ottoman hegemony in Acre under Jezzar Pasha and Abdullah Pasha, Beirut declined to a small town with a population of about 10,000 and was an object of contention between the Ottomans, the local Druze, and the Mamluks. After Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt captured Acre in 1832, Beirut began its revival.\nAfter the Albanian fighter Tafil Buzi was interned and then pardoned by the Ottoman administration for his constant uprisings, he raised 3,000 Albanian mercenaries to fight in Lebanon; some of them became notorious shortly afterwards for having been responsible for the widespread disorders in Beirut.\n\nBy the second half of the nineteenth century, Beirut was developing close commercial and political ties with European imperial powers, particularly France. European interests in Lebanese silk and other export products transformed the city into a major port and commercial center. This boom in cross-regional trade allowed certain groups, such as the Sursock family, to establish trade and manufacturing empires that further strengthened Beirut's position as a key partner in the interests of imperial dynasties. Meanwhile, Ottoman power in the region continued to decline. Sectarian and religious conflicts, power vacuums, and changes in the political dynamics of the region culminated in the 1860 Lebanon conflict. Beirut became a destination for Maronite Christian refugees fleeing from the worst areas of the fighting on Mount Lebanon and in Damascus. This in turn altered the religious composition of Beirut itself, sowing the seeds of future sectarian and religious troubles there and in greater Lebanon. However, Beirut was able to prosper in the meantime. This was again a product of European intervention, and also a general realization amongst the city's residents that commerce, trade, and prosperity depended on domestic stability. After petitions by the local bourgeois, the governor of Syria Vilayet Mehmed Rashid Pasha authorized the establishment of the Beirut Municipal Council, the first municipality established in the Arab provinces of the Empire. The council was elected by an assembly of city notables and played an instrumental role governing the city through the following decades.\n\nVilayet of Beirut\nIn 1888, Beirut was made capital of a vilayet (governorate) in Syria, including the sanjaks (prefectures) Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut, Acre and Bekaa. By this time, Beirut had grown into a cosmopolitan city and had close links with Europe and the United States. It also became a centre of missionary activity that spawned educational institutions such as the American University of Beirut. Provided with water from a British company and gas from a French one, silk exports to Europe came to dominate the local economy. After French engineers established a modern harbour in 1894 and a rail link across Lebanon to Damascus and Aleppo in 1907, much of the trade was carried by French ships to Marseille. French influence in the area soon exceeded that of any other European power. Though French infrastructure investments in the region were supportive, the local merchant elites were able to independently maintain economic power even after the end of the First World War. In contrast, although Beirut was not the only city to receive French attention in this time, it was able to leverage its critical position to its advantage over others (e.g. Damascus). The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica reported a population consisting of 36,000 Muslims, 77,000 Christians, 2,500 Jews, 400 Druze and 4,100 foreigners. At the start of the 20th century, Salim Ali Salam was one of the most prominent figures in Beirut, holding numerous public positions including deputy from Beirut to the Ottoman parliament and President of the Municipality of Beirut. Given his modern way of life, the emergence of Salim Ali Salam as a public figure constituted a transformation in terms of the social development of the city.\n\nIn his 2003 book entitled Beirut and its Seven Families, Yussef Bin Ahmad Bin Ali Al Husseini says:\nThe seven families of Beirut are the families who bonded among each other and made the famous historical agreement with the governor of the Syrian Coast in 1351 to protect and defend the city of Beirut and its shores, and chase the invaders and stop their progress towards it.\n\nModern era\nCapital of Lebanon\nAfter World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Beirut, along with the rest of Lebanon, was placed under the French Mandate. Lebanon achieved independence in 1943, and Beirut became the capital city. The city remained a regional intellectual capital, becoming a major tourist destination and a banking haven, especially for the Persian Gulf oil boom.\nBeirut International Airport was opened on 23 April 1954. It was renamed Rafic Hariri International Airport in 2005 following his assassination. Beirut serves its sole commercial airport as Lebanon's main gateway for flights.\nThis era of relative prosperity ended in 1975 when the Lebanese Civil War broke out throughout the country. During most of the war, Beirut was divided between the Muslim west part and the Christian east. The downtown area, previously the home of much of the city's commercial and cultural activity, became a no man's land known as the Green Line. Many inhabitants fled to other countries. About 60,000 people died in the first two years of the war (1975–1976), and much of the city was devastated. A particularly destructive period was the 1978 Syrian siege of Achrafiyeh, the main Christian district of Beirut. Syrian troops relentlessly shelled the eastern quarter of the city, but Christian militias defeated multiple attempts by Syria's elite forces to capture the strategic area in a three-month campaign later known as the Hundred Days' War.\n\nAnother destructive chapter was the 1982 Lebanon War, during which most of West Beirut was under siege by Israeli troops. In 1983, French and US barracks were bombed, killing 241 American servicemen, 58 French servicemen, six civilians and the two suicide bombers.\nBetween 1989 and 1990 parts on East Beirut were destroyed in fighting between Lebanese army units loyal to General Aoun and Samir Geagea's Maronite Christian Lebanese Forces with the Syrian Armed Forces-backed Elias Hrawi and Salim Al-Huss Lebanese army forces.\nSince the end of the war in 1990, the people of Lebanon have been rebuilding Beirut, whose urban agglomeration was mainly constituted during war time through an anarchic urban development stretching along the littoral corridor and its nearby heights. By the start of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict the city had somewhat regained its status as a tourist, cultural and intellectual centre in the Middle East and as a center for commerce, fashion, and media. The reconstruction of downtown Beirut has been largely driven by Solidere, a development company established in 1994 by Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. The city has hosted both the Asian Club Basketball Championship and the Asian Football Cup, and has hosted the Miss Europe pageant nine times: 1960–1964, 1999, 2001–2002, and 2016.\nRafic Hariri was assassinated in 2005 near the Saint George Hotel in Beirut. A month later about one million people gathered for an opposition rally in Beirut. The Cedar Revolution was the largest rally in Lebanon's history at that time. The last Syrian troops withdrew from Beirut on 26 April 2005, and the two countries established diplomatic relations on 15 October 2008.\n\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon War, Israeli bombardment caused damage in many parts of Beirut, especially the predominantly Shiite southern suburbs of Beirut. On 12 July 2006, the \"Operation Truthful Promise\" carried out by Hezbollah ended with 8 Israeli deaths and 6 injuries. In response, the IDF targeted Hezbollah's main media outlets. There were then artillery raids against targets in southern Lebanon, and the Israeli cabinet held Beirut responsible for the attacks. Then on 13 July 2006 Israel began implementing a naval and air blockade over Lebanon; during this blockade Israel bombed the runways at Beirut International Airport and the major Beirut-Damascus highway in Eastern Lebanon.\nIn May 2008, after the government decided to disband Hezbollah's communications network (a decision it later rescinded), violent clashes broke out briefly between government allies and opposition forces, before control of the city was handed over to the Lebanese Army. After this a national dialogue conference was held in Doha at the invitation of the Prince of Qatar. The conference agreed to appoint a new president of Lebanon and to establish a new national government involving all the political adversaries. As a result of the Doha Agreement, the opposition's barricades were dismantled and so were the opposition's protest camps in Martyrs' Square. On 19 October 2012, a car bomb killed eight people in the Beirut's neighborhood of Achrafiyeh, including Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan, chief of the Intelligence Bureau of the Internal Security Forces. In addition, 78 others were wounded in the bombing. It was the largest attack in the capital since 2008. On 27 December 2013, a car bomb exploded in the Central District killing at least five people, including the former Lebanese ambassador to the U.S. Mohamad Chatah, and wounding 71 others.\nIn the 12 November 2015 Beirut bombings, two suicide bombers detonated explosives outside a mosque and inside a bakery, killing 43 people and injuring 200. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.\nOn 4 August 2020, a massive explosion in the Port of Beirut resulted in the death of at least 203 people (with an additional three missing) and the wounding of more than 6,500. Foreigners from at least 22 countries were among the casualties. Furthermore, at least 108 Bangladeshis were injured in the blasts, making them the most affected foreign community. The cause of the blast is believed to be from government-confiscated and stored ammonium nitrate. As many as 300,000 people have been left homeless by the explosion. Protesters in Lebanon called on the government on 8 August 2020 for the end of the alleged negligence that resulted in the 4 August explosion. On 10 August 2020, as a result of the protests, Prime Minister Hassan Diab announced his resignation. Weeks later, a huge fire erupted in an oil and tyre warehouse in the port's duty-free zone, on 10 September 2020.\n\nGeography\nBeirut sits on a peninsula extending westward into the Mediterranean Sea. It is flanked by the Lebanon Mountains and has taken on a triangular shape, largely influenced by its situation between and atop two hills: Al-Ashrafieh and Al-Musaytibah. The Beirut Governorate occupies 18 square kilometres (6.9 sq mi), and the city's metropolitan area 67 square kilometres (26 sq mi). The coast is rather diverse, with rocky beaches, sandy shores and cliffs situated beside one another.\n\nClimate\nBeirut has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa, bordering on As, Trewartha: Csal) characterized by mild days and nights, as its coastal location allows temperatures to be moderated by the sea. Autumn and spring are warm, but short. Winter is mild and rainy; frost has never been recorded. Summer is prolonged, hot and humid. The prevailing wind during the afternoon and evening is from the west (onshore, blowing in from the Mediterranean); at night it reverses to offshore, blowing from the land out to sea.\nThe average annual rainfall is 825 millimetres (32.5 in), with the large majority of it falling from October to April. Much of the autumn and spring rain falls in heavy downpours on a limited number of days, but in winter it is spread more evenly over many days. Summer receives very little rainfall, if any. Snow is rare, except in the mountainous eastern suburbs, where snowfall occurs due to the region's high altitudes. Hail (which can often be heavy) occurs a few times per year, mostly during winter.\n\nEnvironmental issues\nLebanon, especially Beirut and its suburbs, suffered a massive garbage crisis, mainly from July 2015 up to March 2016. The issue began when authorities shut down the main landfill site originally used for Beirut's garbage south-east of the city and failed to provide any alternative solutions for months. As a result, garbage mounted in the streets in Greater Beirut and caused protests to erupt, which sometimes invoked police action. This problem was commonly blamed on the country's political situation. This garbage crisis birthed a movement called \"You Stink\" which was directed at the country's politicians. In March 2016, the government came up with a so-called temporary solution to establish two new landfills East and South of the city to store the garbage, while several municipalities across the country, in an unprecedented move, began recycling and managing waste more efficiently, building waste-management facilities and relying on themselves rather than the central government. Moreover, Beirut has a lack of green areas with just two main public gardens (sanayeh and horch Beirut). In fact, concrete roofs cover 80% of the capital area.\n\nQuarters and sectors\nBeirut is divided into 12 quarters (quartiers):\n\nAchrafieh\nDar Mreisse\nBachoura\nMazraa (with the neighbourhood Badaro)\nMedawar (with the neighbourhood Mar Mikhaël)\nMinet El Hosn\nMoussaitbeh (with Ramlet al-Baida)\nPort\nRas Beirut\nRmeil\nSaifi\nZuqaq al-Blat\nThese quarters are divided into 59 sectors (secteurs).\n\nBadaro is an edgy, bohemian style neighborhood, within the green district of Beirut (secteur du parc) which also include the Beirut Hippodrome and the Beirut Pine Forest and the French ambassador's Pine Residence. It is one of Beirut's favorite hip nightlife destination.\nTwo of the twelve official Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon are located in the southern suburbs of Beirut: Bourj el-Barajneh and Shatila. There is also one within its municipal boundaries: Mar Elias.\n\nSouthern suburban districts include Chiyah, Ghobeiry (Bir Hassan, Jnah and Ouzai are part of the Ghobeiry municipality), Haret Hreik, Burj al Barajneh, Laylake-Mreijeh, Hay al Sillum and Hadath. Eastern suburbs include Burj Hammoud, Sin el Fil, Dekwane and Mkalles. Hazmiyeh is also considered as an eastern suburb with its close proximity to the capital. Of the 15 unregistered or unofficial refugee camps, Sabra, which lies adjacent to Shatila, is also located in southern Beirut and was the scene of a massacre during the civil war.\nPeople in Lebanon often use different names for the same geographic locations, and few people rely on official, government-provided street numbers. Instead, historic and commercial landmarks are more commonly used.\n\nDemographics\nNo population census has been taken in Lebanon since 1932, but estimates of Beirut's population range from as low as 938,940 through 1,303,129 to as high as 2,200,000 as part of Greater Beirut.\n\nReligion\nBeirut is one of the most cosmopolitan and religiously diverse cities of Lebanon and all of the Middle East. Before the civil war the neighborhoods of Beirut were fairly heterogeneous, but they became largely segregated by religion since the conflict. East Beirut has a mainly Christian population with a small Muslim minority, whilst West Beirut has a Sunni Muslim majority with small minorities of Shia, Christians and Druze. Since the end of the civil war, East and West Beirut have begun to see an increase in Muslims and Christians moving into each half. Christians comprise 35% of Beirut's population, Muslims 63%, Druze 1%, and others 1%.\n\nFamily matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance are still handled by the religious authorities representing a person's faith (the Ottoman \"millet\" system). Calls for civil marriage are unanimously rejected by the religious authorities, but civil marriages held in another country are recognized by Lebanese civil authorities.\n\nLanguages\nLebanon does not hold a census survey; researchers at the American University of Beirut have found that trilingualism - between Lebanese Arabic, French and English - is common and normal among Beirut residents. The use of all three languages crosses between the city's different sects and geography, and are a common occurrence in both the more cosmopolitan and the more conservative neighborhoods. The research found that French or English is disproportionately heard nearby Francophone or Anglophone, respectively, educational institutions. Some minorities in Beirut also speak Armenian, Aramaic, and Amharic.\n\nBeirut Central District\nThe Beirut Central District (BCD) or Centre Ville is the name given to Beirut's historical and geographical core by \"Solidere\", the \"vibrant financial, commercial, and administrative hub of the country\". It is an area thousands of years old, traditionally a focus of business, finance, culture and leisure. Its reconstruction constitutes one of the most ambitious contemporary urban developments. Due to the devastation incurred on the city center from the Lebanese Civil War, the Beirut Central District underwent a thorough reconstruction and development plan that gave it back its cultural and economic position in the region. Ever since, Beirut Central District has evolved into an integrated business and commercial environment and the focus of the financial activity in the region. That evolution was accompanied with the relocation of international organizations, reoccupation of civic and government buildings, expansion of financial activities, and establishment of regional headquarters and global firms in the city center.\n\nAssessment of the demand for build-up space in the BCD has been done in reference to a number of macro-economic, demographic, and urban planning considerations at a time of marked need for new activity poles in the city, such as Souks, financial, cultural and recreational centers. The district's total area is 4,690,000 square metres (50,482,740 square feet), the majority of which is dedicated to residential space (1,924,000 square metres or 20,709,764 square feet). The Beirut Central District contains over 60 gardens, squares and open spaces. These spaces comprise landscaped streets, gardens, historical squares, pedestrian areas and sea promenades thus totaling to an area of 96 acres (39 ha) of open spaces.\nThe central district is Lebanon's prime location for shopping, entertainment, and dining. There are over 100 cafes, restaurants, pubs and nightclubs open in the Beirut Central District, and over 350 retail outlets distributed along its streets and quarters. Beirut Souks alone are home to over 200 stores and a handful of restaurants and cafes. Beirut Souks are the Central District's old medieval market, recently renovated along with the original Hellenistic street grid that characterized the old souks and the area's historical landmarks along long vaulted shopping alleys and arcades. Solidere, the company responsible for the reconstruction and renovation of the district, organizes music and entertainment events all throughout the year like the Beirut Marathon, Fête de la Musique, Beirut Jazz Festival.\nHowever, the means of urban development in this particular area of the city was subject to much criticism and controversy. Rafic Hariri, who would later become prime minister, was the majority stakeholder of the company, which raises concerns of conflict of interest in the context of a public-private partnership. Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at undervalued land rates, and partly paid in company share. Strict urbanization laws were put in order to oblige people to sell and not renovate themselves. Today, Solidere acts as a de facto municipality, thus this quarter of the city is effectively privatized. It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay, a marina where many restaurants are located, and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police.\nThe project was also criticized for destroying some of the city's architectural and cultural heritage. \"Among the hundreds of destroyed buildings were \"the last Ottoman and medieval remains in Beirut\" wrote American University of Beirut professor Nabil Beyhum in the Journal The Beirut Review in 1992. Much of the damage had been done through unapproved demolitions in the 1980s and early 1990s, bringing down \"some of the capital's most significant buildings and structures,\" wrote UCLA professor Saree Makdisi in the journal, Critical Inquiry, in 1997.\". Moreover, many of the traditional privately owned shops in the Beirut Downtown were replaced by luxury outlets and high-end restaurants that only few people could afford. And most of public spaces promised by Solidere since the start of the reconstruction, such as \"The Garden of Forgiveness\", a central park, and an archaeological museum, remain unfinished until today, putting into question the actual benefit of the project to the population.\nThe actual success of the project has recently been in doubt, given that large quarters of the BCD are today empty, due to strong military presence, the Nejmeh Square where the parliament is located is most frequently completely deserted, and the businesses located there have mostly moved.\n\nEconomy\nBeirut's economy is service-oriented with the main growth sectors being banking and tourism.\nBeirut became a banking hub by leveraging its position as a commercial port and cultural center within the world economy. Under French mandate after World War I, France heavily invested in the city, reinforcing its role as a regional financial center. The Open Door Policy facilitated foreign capital inflows, with French firms dominating investments and four of Beirut's five leading banks being French-owned by the 1920s, after which the city further solidified its status as a key financial link between the West and the decolonizing Middle East.\nIn an area dominated by authoritarian or militarist regimes, the Lebanese capital was generally regarded as a haven of libertarianism, though a precarious one, as the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990) and subsequent conflicts significantly altered the political landscape. With its seaport and airport—coupled with Lebanon's free economic and foreign exchange system, solid gold-backed currency, banking-secrecy law, and favorable interest rates—Beirut became an established banking center for Arab wealth, much of which was invested in construction, commercial enterprise, and industry (mostly the manufacture of textiles and shoes, food processing, and printing). The economy of Beirut is diverse, including publishing, banking, trade and various industries. During that period, Beirut was the region's financial services center. At the onset of the oil boom starting in the 1960s, Lebanon-based banks were the main recipients of the region's petrodollars.\n\nBeirut is the focal point of the Economy of Lebanon. The capital hosts the headquarters of Banque du Liban  (Lebanon's central bank), the Beirut Stock Exchange, the head office of Lebanon's flag-carrier Middle East Airlines, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, the Union of Arab Banks, and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges.\n\nBanking and finance\nThe banking system is the backbone of the local economy with a balance sheet of $152 billion at the end of 2012, nearing 3.5 times the GDP estimated at $43 billion by the IMF. Bank deposits also increased in 2012 by 8% to 125 billion dollars, 82 percent of the sector's assets. \"Banks are still attracting deposits because the interest rates offered are higher than the ones in Europe and the United States\", says Marwan Mikhael, head of research at BLOM Bank.\nBeirut's foreign reserves were still close to an all-time high when they reached $32.5 billion in 2011 and analysts say that the Central Bank can cover nearly 80 percent of the Lebanese currency in the market. This means that the Central Bank can easily cope with any unforeseen crisis in the future thanks to the massive foreign currency reserves.\nThe Lebanese banking system is endowed with several characteristics that promote the role of Beirut as a regional financial center, in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings. The Lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency. Moreover, no restrictions are put on the free flow of capital and earnings into and out of the Lebanese economy. The passing of the banking secrecy law on 3 September 1956, subjected all banks established in Lebanon as well as foreign banks' branches to the \"secret of the profession\". Both article 16 of law No. 282 dated 30 December 1993 and article 12 of decree No. 5451 dated 26 August 1994, offer exemptions from income tax on all interest and revenues earned on all types of accounts opened in Lebanese banks. On the first of April 1975, decree No. 29 established a free banking zone by granting the Lebanese government the right to exempt non-residents' deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from: the income tax on interest earned, the required reserves imposed by the Banque Du Liban by virtue of article 76 of the Code of Money and Credit, the premium of deposit guarantee imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the National Deposit Guarantee Institution.\n\nTourism\nThe tourism industry in Beirut has been historically important to the local economy and remains to this day to be a major source of revenue for the city, and Lebanon in general. Before the Lebanese Civil War, Beirut was widely regarded as the \"Paris of the Middle East\",  and also \"Switzerland of the Middle East\", often cited as a financial and business hub where visitors could experience the Levantine Mediterranean culture. Beirut's diverse atmosphere and ancient history make it an important destination which is slowly rebuilding itself after continued turmoil. However, in recent times, certain countries, such as the United States, have frequently placed Lebanon, and Beirut in particular, on their travel warnings lists due to the many car bombings and orchestrated acts of political violence.\n\nAccording to the 2012 tourist statistics, 34% of the tourists in Beirut came from states within the Arab League, 33% came from European countries (mainly France, Germany, and Britain), and 16% from the Americas (about half of which are from the United States).\nThe largely pedestrianized Beirut Central District is the core of the Beirut tourism scene. The district is a cluster of stone-façade buildings lining arcaded streets and radial alleyways. The architecture of the area is a mix of French Architecture and Venetian Gothic architecture mixed with Arabesque and Ottoman Architecture. The district contains numerous old mosques and crusader churches, as well as uncovered remnants and ruins of the Roman era. The District contains dozens of restaurants, cafes and pubs, as well as a wide range of shopping stores mainly in Beirut Souks. High-rise hotels and towers line the district's New Waterfront, marina and seaside promenade.\nAnother popular tourist destination in Beirut is the Corniche Beirut, a 4.8 km (3 mi) pedestrian promenade that encircles the capital's seafront from the Saint George Bay in the north all the way to Avenue de Paris and Avenue General de Gaulle south of the city. The corniche reaches its maximum height above sea level at Raouché, a high-rise residential neighbourhood rising over a giant white limestone cliff and facing the recognisable off-shore Raouché Rocks.\nBadaro is one of Beirut's most appealing neighborhoods, a lovely place to stroll during daytime and a destination for going out in the evening. Badaro is within Beirut's green district with a 75-acre (30-hectare) public park (The Beirut Pine forest) and a 50-acre (20-hectare) hippodrome. It is a neighborhood on a very human scale with small groceries around every corner. The neighborhood residents, a mix of old impoverished Christian bourgeoisie, bohemian style people in their 30s and well-established urban professionals, are loyal to local bakery and pastry shops. Because of the blossoming café and bar scene it has become lately a hip destination for Beirut's young and restless but old Beirutis remember that Badaro was already Beirut's version of the Village in the swinging sixties. Groceries and eateries can be found on almost every street of the area. There are dozens of restaurants, pubs and footpath cafés of virtually every style. Badaro \"Village\" thrives on local residents, day-trippers and hipsters from all over Beirut, office employees and many expatriates.\nHamra Street is a long cobblestone street connecting the Beirut Central District with the coastal Raouche area. The street is a large concentration of shopping stores, boutiques, restaurants, banks, street vendors, footpath cafes, newspaper kiosks, and a booming nightlife spurred by students from the neighboring American University of Beirut. The AUB campus is another popular visitor destination, composed of a cluster of 19th century red-roofed buildings dispersed on a wooded hillside overlooking the Mediterranean.\nGemmayzeh is Beirut's artistic bohemian quarter, full of narrow streets and historic buildings from the French era. It is located East of the Beirut Central District, bordering the Saifi Village. The neighborhood is well known for its trendy bars and pubs, cafes, restaurants and lounges; most are directly located on Rue Gouraud, the main thoroughfare that cuts through the middle of the district. Travel + Leisure magazine called Gemmayzeh \"SoHo by the Sea,\" due to its colorful and chic cafés amid 1950s apartment buildings and hole-in-the-wall shops. However, Gemmayzeh received the most damage by the Beirut explosion in 2020.\n\nBeirut is a destination for tourists from both the Arab world and West. In Travel + Leisure magazine's World Best Awards 2006, it was ranked the 9th best city in the world. That list was voted upon shortly before the 2006 Lebanon War broke out, but in 2008 The Guardian listed Beirut as one of its top ten cities in the world. The New York Times ranked it at number one on its \"44 places to go\" list of 2009. 2011 MasterCard Index revealed that Beirut had the second-highest visitor spending levels in the Middle East and Africa, totaling $6.5 billion. Beirut was chosen in 2012 by Condé Nast Traveller as the best city in the Middle East, beating Tel Aviv and Dubai.\nMany of the tourists are returning Lebanese expatriates, but many are from Western countries. Approximately 3 million visitors visited in 2010; the previous record was 1.4 million in 1974.\nLike other forms of tourism, medical tourism in Lebanon is on the rise recently. Although visitors from neighboring Arab nations make up the bulk of medical tourism patients here due to its proximity, Beirut is strongly trying to woo more Southern Europeans, Asians and North Americans to its land. Its Agency for Investment Development in Lebanon reports that growth in the medical tourism industry is growing by up to 30% a year since 2009. The country's tourism ministry is working closely with the medical sector and top-class hotels to create an organized, quality medical destination. Major hotel and spa chains work with local clinics, travel agencies and the tourism ministry to create comprehensive healthcare and recuperation packages for foreign visitors. The government is highly involved in this industry and strives to make the process as easy as possible.\nCosmetic surgery is a major component of medical tourism in Lebanon. Most of the foreign patients come for routine operations like plastic surgery, dental or eye surgery, and Beirut's hospitals are also capable of performing specialized procedures such as internal bypass surgery and other technical treatments. Its top clinics and hospitals like Sahel General are equipped to handle the full range of surgical procedures. Beirut-based Clemenceau Medical Center (CMC), affiliated with Johns Hopkins International, was ranked one of the world's top ten best hospitals for medical tourism in 2012.\n\nGovernment\nBeirut is the capital of Lebanon and its seat of government. The Lebanese Parliament, all the Ministries and most of the public administrations, embassies and consulates are there. Beirut Governorate is one of eight mohafazat (plural of mohafazah, or governorate).\n\nInternational organizations\nThe city is home to numerous international organizations. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) is headquartered in downtown Beirut, The Arab Air Carriers' Organization (AACO), the Union of Arab Banks and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges and  the World youth alliance are also headquartered in the city. The International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) both have regional offices in Beirut covering the Arab world.\n\nEducation\nHigher education throughout Lebanon is provided by universities, colleges and technical and vocational institutes. The Directorate General of Higher Education is responsible for managing universities, colleges, and institutes in Beirut and nationwide.\nThe American University of Beirut (AUB) and Université Saint-Joseph (USJ) are the oldest English-language and French-language universities in the country, respectively. AUB was founded in 1866, and USJ in 1875. The Lebanese University is the only public institution for higher education in Beirut. Beirut is also home to Lebanese American University (LAU), American University of Science and Technology (AUST), University of Balamand, École Supérieure des Affaires (ESA), Beirut Arab University (BAU), Haigazian University (HU), Lebanese International University (LIU), Notre Dame University – Louaize (NDU), and Université La Sagesse (ULS).\nAmong the private secondary schools in Beirut are Lycee Abdel Kader, Grand Lycée Franco-Libanais, Lycée Franco-Libanais Verdun, American Community School, International College, Collège Louise Wegmann, Rawdah High School, Saint Mary's Orthodox College, Collège Notre Dame de Nazareth, Collège du Sacré-Coeur Gemmayzé, Collège Protestant Français, Armenian Evangelical Central High School, German School of Beirut, and the Armenian Hamazkayin Arslanian College.\n\nTransportation\nThe city's renovated airport is the Rafic Hariri International Airport, located in the southern suburbs. The Port of Beirut, one of the largest and most commercial in the eastern Mediterranean, is another port of entry. As a final destination, Lebanon can be reached by road from Damascus via the Beqaa valley in the east.\nBeirut has frequent bus connections to other cities in Lebanon and major cities in Syria such as Homs and its capital Damascus. There are a number of different companies providing public transport in Lebanon. The publicly owned buses are managed by Office des Chemins de Fer et des Transports en Commun (OCFTC – \"Railway and Public Transportation Authority\"). Buses for northern destinations and Syria leave from Charles Helou Station.\nThe ministry of transport and public works purchased an extra 250 intra and inter-buses in 2012 to better serve regions outside the capital as well as congestion-choked Beirut, hoping to lessen the use of private cars.\nBeirut has also private buses that are provided by the Lebanese Commuting Company.\nIn 2017, Beirut introduced a bike sharing service in certain areas of the city.\nIn 2024, Ahdab Commuting and Trading Company (ACTC), alongside the Ministry of Transport, reintroduced a proper public bus system with an appropriate network of lanes using the 50 buses donated by France in 2022. \nThe network connects most areas of Beirut through 7 major lines (B1-7), as well as connecting Beirut to other major cities like Tripoli and Saida through 4 lines (ML1-4). These lines however do not replace the existing service microbuses, they complement them.\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Beirut has evolved under the influence of many different peoples and civilizations, such as Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Ottoman Turks and French. The law school in downtown Beirut was one of the world's earliest and was considered to be a leading center of legal studies in the Eastern Roman Empire.\nBeirut hosted the Francophonie and Arab League summits in 2002, and in 2007 it hosted the ceremony for the Prix Albert Londres, which rewards outstanding francophone journalists every year. The city also hosted the Jeux de la Francophonie in 2009. In the same year, it was proclaimed World Book Capital by UNESCO.\nBeirut has also been called the \"party capital of the Arab world\". Rue Monnot has an international reputation among clubbers, and Rue Gouraud in districts such as Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael have emerged as new hotspots for bar patrons and clubbers, as well as \"The Alleyway\" in Hamra Street.\n\nMuseums\nThe National Museum of Beirut is the principal museum of archaeology in Lebanon. It has about 1,300 exhibits ranging in date from prehistoric times to the medieval Mamluk period. The Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut is the third-oldest museum in the Middle East, exhibiting a wide range of artefacts from Lebanon and neighboring countries. Sursock Museum was built by the illustrious Sursock family at the end of the 19th century as a private villa for Nicolas Sursock, and then donated to the Lebanese state upon his death. It now houses Beirut's most influential and popular art museum. The permanent collection shows a set of Japanese engravings, numerous works of Islamic art and classic Italian paintings, while temporary exhibitions are also shown throughout the year. The Robert Mouawad Private Museum near Beirut's Grand Serail exhibits Henri Pharaon's private collection of archaeology and antiques.\nPlanet Discovery is a children's science museum with interactive experiments, exhibitions, performances, workshops and awareness competitions. The Saint Joseph University opened the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory in 2000, the first prehistory museum in the Arabic Middle East, displaying bones, stone tools and neolithic pottery collected by Jesuits.\nIn October 2013, Mim Museum, a private mineral museum, opened its doors to the public. It has on display some 2000 minerals from more than 70 countries. Mim museum's collection is considered to be one of the world's paramount private collection for the variety and quality of its minerals. A didactic circuit, accompanied by screens showing films and scientific applications of mineralogy, will reveal a world of unsuspected marvels—priceless both from an aesthetic and scientific point of view. Mimodactylus libanensis \"mimo\", the fossil of a Pterodactyl, is featured in a special wing. This one-of-a-kind complete specimen in the Middle-East was found in Lebanon. It is promoted by means of state-of-the-art modern techniques: a hologram, an auto-stereoscopic movie, a full-scale reconstitution and a game \"fly with mimo\" – an entertainment that delights children and adults. Moreover, Mim hosts a thematic exhibition of 200 marine fossils. \"Fish'n'Stone\" was organised with the collaboration of Mémoire du Temps. Known throughout the world, those fossils were quarried in the Lebanese mountains. The history of the fossil formation is shown through an animation that submerges you in the marine life – a time capsule that takes you in a journey to some 100 million of years ago.\n\nTourism\nBeirut was named the top place to visit by The New York Times in 2009, and as one of the ten liveliest cities in the world by Lonely Planet in the same year. According to a 2010 study by the American global consulting firm Mercer comparing high-end items such as upscale residential areas and entertainment venues, Beirut was ranked as the 4th most expensive city in the Middle East and 15th among the Upper Middle Income Countries included in the survey. Beirut came in first place regionally and 10th place internationally in a 2010 study by \"EuroCost International\" about the rental markets for high quality housing.

تتركَز فيها معظم المرافق الحيويه من صناعه وتجاره وخدمات. وهي مدينه قديمه وعريقه اذ ذكرت في رسائل تل العمارنه والمؤرخه الى القرن الخامس عشر ما قبل الميلاد وهي ماهوله منذ ذلك الحين.\nبيروت هي مركز الثقل السياسي اللبناني حيث مقر معظم الدوائر السياسيه مثل البرلمان ورئاسه الحكومه بالاضافه لمراكز معظم الوزارات والدوائر الحكوميه. تلعب الدور الرئيسي في الحركه الاقتصاديه اللبنانيه. وتعد المدينه احدى اهم

الكوارث من زلازل وحروب على مر التاريخ كان اهمها الحرب الاهليه اللبنانيه المدمره. وبعد انتهاء الحرب سنه 1990، اعادت الدوله في عهد حكومه رئيس وزراء لبنان انذاك رفيق الحريري اعمار وتاهيل المدينه وبخاصه وسطها التجاري وواجهتها البحريه وملاهيها الليليه مما اعاد تالق سياحتها وجعلها مقصداً سياحياً جذاباً. قامت صحيفه النيويورك تايمز بمنح بيروت المركز الاول بين قائمه الاماكن التي ينبغي زيارتها في سنه 2009، كما صُنّفت ضمن المدن العشره الاوائل الاكثر حيويه في عام 2009 بواسطه دليل لونلي بلانت السياحي. وفي عام 2020، مرّت بيروت بكارثه اُخرى حيث حصلَ انفجار ضخم في مرفا المدينه مما خلف عشرات القتلى والاف الجرحى وتسبب بدمار كبير في عدد من احيائها نتج عنه نزوح 300 الف مواطن لبناني.\nكشف مؤشر «ماستر كارد» لعام 2011، ان بيروت استاثرت بالمركز الثاني من حيث نسبه البذخ السياحي بين جميع مدن الشرق الاوسط وافريقيا. اما المركز الاول فاحتلته دبي، التي بلغ مقدار ما صرفه فيها السوّاح حوالي 7.8 مليار دولار، تليها بيروت مباشره بحوالي 6.5 مليارات دولار، ثم تل ابيب بحوالي 3.8 مليارات، ثم القاهره (3.7 مليارات دولار)، فجوهانسبرغ (3.3 مليارات دولار). كذلك وُضعت بيروت في المرتبه التاسعه بين قائمه اكثر المدن زيارهً في العالم.\n\nالتسميه\nاقدم ذكر عبر الوثائق التاريخيه لاسم بيروت ورد بلفظ «بيروتا» في الواح تل العمارنه التي وجدت في مصر، والتي تحوي مراسلات تمت بين ملوك جبيل والفرعون امينوفيس الرابع المعروف باخناتون (مطلع القرن الرابع عشر ق.م.) ورد فيها اسم «بيروتا» وملكها «عمونيرا». سماها الفنيقيون «بيريت» ँ‌ऀ‌ओ‌क وهي كلمه فينيقيه تعني الابار. وقيل انها كانت تدعى\n«بيريتيس» او «بيروتوس» او «بيرُووَه» نسبه للالهه «بيروت»، اعز الهه لبنان وصاحبه ادونيس اله جبيل. وعُرفت المدينه باسم «بيريتوس» (باليونانيه القديمه:βηρυτός) في الادبيات الاغريقيه. واعتمد هذا الاسم في دوريات الاثار المنشوره في الجامعه الاميركيه في بيروت منذ 1934.\nوذكر ان «بيروت» بالمعنى السامي تعني «الصنوبر» لغابات الصنوبر، بسبب وقوعها بالقرب من غابه صنوبر كبيره هي اليوم ما يُعرف بحرش او حرج بيروت. ومن الاسماء الاخرى التي دعيت بها منطقه بيروت هو: «لاذقيه كنعان»، «مستوطنه جوليا اغسطس بيريتوس السعيده»، «دربي»، «رديدون»، «باروت». ولقبت المدينه عبر العصور بالعديد من الالقاب منها: سماها الفينيقيون «بالمدينه الالهه» و«بيروت الابيّه والمجيده» لعنادها في مقارعه مدينه «صيدون» و«زهره الشرق»، واطلق عليها الرومان «ام الشرائع» بسبب بناء اكبر معهد للقانون بالامبراطوريه فيها. ونعتها العثمانيون «بالدره الغاليه». في العصر الحديث خلدها نزار قباني بلقب «ست الدنيا». وعرفت ايضا باسم «باريس الشرق» خلال فتره الستينات واوائل السبعينات من القرن العشرين، اي خلال عهد الازدهار الاقتصادي في لبنان.\n\nتاريخ بيروت\nيعود تاريخ بيروت الى اكثر من 5000 عام. تدل اعمال الحفريات الاثريه في وسط بيروت على تنوع الحضارات التي مرت على المدينه، فقد عُثر على طبقات متعدده من الاثار الفينيقيه والهيلينيه والرومانيه والعربيه والعثمانيه التي تبعد عن بعضها بمسافه ضئيله.\n\nعصور ما قبل التاريخ\nاكتشف الباحثون وعلماء الاثار عدّه مواقع اثريه تقع ضمن حدود المناطق التي تُشكّل مدينه بيروت المعاصره، وكان معظم هذه المواقع يحتوي على ادوات صوّانيه تعود لعهود متعاقبه تبدا من العصرين الحجريين: القديم الوسيط والقديم العلوي، مرورًا بالعصر الحجري الحديث ووصولاً الى العصر البرونزي. اما ابرز هذه المواقع فهي:\n\nموقع ميناء الحصن: وصفه الباحثون بانه «قريه بيروتيّه»، ويُرجّح ان موقع الاصلي كان على شاطئ البحر بالقرب من فندقيّ الشرق وبسول، في الجادّه الفرنسيه المعروفه محليًا باسم «شارع الفرنساويه». اكتُشف الموقع في سنه 1894، ودُرس لاول مره على يد احد الاباء اليسوعيين في سنه 1900. وُصفت الادوات الصوانيه التي عُثر عليها في الموقع بانها موستيريه، وقد احتفظ بها متحف الفنون الجميله في ليون.\nموقع ام الخطيب: يقع شمال منطقه الطريق الجديده الحاليه، وعُثر فيه على ادوات صوّانيه ترجع للعصر النحاسي. تدمّر هذا الموقع بعد ان شُيدت عليه مبان في سنه 1948.\nموقع فرن الشبّاك: يقع على الضفه اليسرى من نهر بيروت، حيث تنتهي حدود المدينه. كانت المنطقه مغطاه سابقًا بالرمال الحمراء التي شكّلت مصاطبًا للنهر ترجع للعصر الرباعي. عثرت مجموعه من الاباء اليسوعيين على هذا الموقع، واكتشفوا فيه عدد كبير من الادوات الصوّانيه التي تعود للعصر الحجري القديم الوسيط، وقد كان معظمها مغروسًا في الرمال على ضفه النهر. شملت المكتشفات حوالي 50 اداه قطع تعود للفتره الاشولينيه، يحتفظ بها اليوم المتحف اللبناني للاثار القبتاريخيه.\nموقع نهر بيروت: قيل بانه وقع في بستان لاشجار التوت على الضفه اليسرى للنهر بالقرب من خط سكه الحديد المتوجهه الى طرابلس. اكتشف في هذا الموقع عدّه بقايا لرماح وحجاره صوّانيه مسننه وعظام مدفونه وسط الطمي. وقد شُيّدت عليه مبان في الوقت الحالي.\nكما عُثر في مواقع اخرى، اهمها موقعا البطركيّه والبرج، على بقايا فؤوس قديمه، وعلى قبور تعود لاواسط العصر البرونزي، في المنطقه الاخيره، مما دفع الباحثين للقول ان «تل» بيروت القديم، او المستعمره البشريه الرئيسيّه، كانت تقوم في ذاك المكان.\n\nالعصور القديمه\nبُنيت بيروت من قبل اهل جبيل (بيبلوس) قبل اربعه الاف سنه، وما لبثت ان كبرت وعمرت بالسكان واصبحت مملكه مستقله على الساحل الذي كان يُعرف باسم فينيقيا وعبد اهلها الها خاصاً بها اسمه «بعل بيريت» اي اله او سيّد بيروت، وضربت باسمها عمله نقديّه تحمل رسماً يمثل هذا الاله. واول اشاره لمدينه بيروت تعود للقرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد حيث ذكرت في رسائل تل العمارنه المسماريه التي ذكرت عن «عمونيرا» ملك «بيريت». الذي ارسل ثلاث رسائل الى الفرعون المصري. كما ذكرت «بيريت» في رسائل «رب حدا» ملك جبيل. وانشئت اول مستوطناتها على جزيره وسط نهرها التي طُمرت عبر الازمان.\nخضعت بيروت لحكم المصريين بعد ان قام الفرعون تحتموس الثالث باحتلال الساحل الشرقي للبحر المتوسط اثناء طرده للهكسوس من مصر، وبعد المصريين قام كل من الاشوريين والكلدانيين والفرس بالسيطره على فينيقيا ومنها بيروت، قبل ان يهزم الاسكندر الاكبر الفرس ويضم المدينه لامبراطوريته. وفي سنه 140ق.م احتلها ودمرها «ديودوتوس تريفون»، الملك الهيليني، خلال صراعه مع «انيوخس السابع» للسيطره على عرش الدوله السلوقيه. ومن ثم اعيد بناؤها على الطراز الهيليني وسميت «لاوديسيا الفينيقيه» (باليونانيه: Λαοδικεια ή του Φοινίκη) وفي بعض الاحيان «لاوديسيا الكنعانيه». تقع المدينه اليوم على انقاض تلك التي بناها اليونان، كما اظهرت الحفريات التي اعيد العمل بها بعد انتهاء الحرب الاهليه سنه 1991. وتشير احدى الحفريات من سنه 1994 الى ان شارع «سوق الطويله» الحديث هو تطور لشارع هيليني او روماني قديم.\n\nواحتل بيروت الجنرال الروماني ماركوس اغريبا في عام 64 ق.م. وسماها «مستوطنه جوليا اغسطس بيريتوس السعيده» (باللاتينيه: Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus) تيمنا بجوليا بنت الامبراطور اغسطس ونظرا لاهميه المدينه تمركز فيها الفيلقان الرومانيان: المقدوني الخامس، والغالي الثالث مما حولها الى جزء من الامبراطوريه الرومانيه وبالتالي تمّ تعميرها وفقا للنمط المعماري الروماني، فبُنيت فيها الابنيه، من هياكل ومسارح وحمامات، ومؤسسات حكوميّه فخمه.\nعرفت المدينه ازهى ايامها خلال عهد هيرودوس فاصبحت مدينه رومانيه كامله الحقوق في سنه 14 ق.م، ومنحت لقب المستمعره الممتازه. اشتهرت بيروت تحت الحكم الروماني بمدرسه القانون والتي استمرت بتدريس الحقوق لاكثر من 300 عام، وكانت في ذلك العهد مرجعاً لطلاب العلم من الوطنيين والاجانب. وهي المدرسه التي اكسبت المدينه في ذلك الحين للقب «ام الشرائع ومرضعه العلوم». من اشهر مدرسيها الحقوقيين الفينيقيين «بابينيانوس» و«اولبيانوس»، الذين اشتهرا خلال حكم الاباطره السيفريين، والذي كان عملهما اساس قانون جستنيان الاول المعروف «بالبندكتس». دُمرت المدرسه نتيجهً لموجه الزلازل التي ضربت بيروت في سنه551 للميلاد، فنقل طلابها الى مدينه صيدون. وقتل الزلزال 30,000 بيروتي و250,000 من سكان الساحل الفينيقي، الامر الذي افقد بيروت اهميتها خلال السنين المتبقيه لها تحت حكم الروم البيزنطينين.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nبعد حوالي مائه سنه من دمار المدينه، اي خلال سنه 635م، فتحها العرب بقياده معاويه بن ابي سفيان في زمن خلافه عمر بن الخطاب ثاني الخلفاء الراشدين الذي امر بترميمها وتحصينها بالقلاع لحمايتها من هجمات الروم الذين حاولوا عبثاً استعادتها عده مرات. وفي تلك الفتره لم تحظ بيروت بشهره كبيره واهميه تذكر مثل تلك التي حظيت بها مدينه عكا كمركز تجاري في شرقي البحر المتوسط.\nعندما ارتقى معاويه بن ابي سفيان سده الخلافه الاسلاميّه جلب الى بيروت قوماً من الفرس واسكنهم فيها مثلما فعل بغيرها من مدن الساحل الشامي وبعلبك. كانت المدينه خلال عهد الخلفاء الراشدين والامويين ثم العباسيين، تابعه لدمشق، واتخذها المسلمون في العهود المذكوره رباطاً، اي قاعده عسكريّه، ومنها انطلقت الجيوش العربيّه التي حملها معاويه على الاسطول الذي فتح به جزيره قبرص ايام عثمان بن عفان. وفي ايام ابي جعفر المنصور، ثاني الخلفاء العباسيين، ظهر فيها عدد من العلماء البارزين اهمهم عبد الرحمن الاَوزاعي، المعروف باسم «الامام الاوزاعي» المتوفى سنه 773، وقبره ما يزال موجوداً بالقرب منها عند الجهه الجنوبيّه على ساحل البحر، في منطقه اصبحت تحمل اسمه، وهذا القبر كان وما يزال مقصداً للناس الذين يزورونه ويتبركون به. استعاد ملك البيزنطيين «يوحنا زيميسياس» بيروت عام 974 ولبث فيها نحو سنه، ثم اخرجته منها القوات المصريّه التي ارسبها جوهر الصقلي في ايام العبيديين حكّام مصر في ذلك الحين، وفي زمنهم كانت هذه المدينه تابعه لدمشق المرتبطه راساً بالقاهره حاضره الخلافه العبيديّه يومذاك.\n\nهاجمت جيوش الصليبيين بيروت سنه 1102، بالرغم من انها لم تكن مهمه في ذلك الوقت، لكنها امتنعت عليهم وصدتهم، فلما كانت سنه 1110 اعادت هذه الجيوش الكرّه عليها بقياده «بغدوين الاول» وتمكنت من احتلالها. وبقي الصليبيون في المدينه حتى سنه 1291، وكانت في تلك الفتره تابعه لمملكه بيت المقدس وقد اعتمد ازدهارها في ذلك الوقت على حركه تبادلها التجاري مع اوروبا في البهارات. ومن اشهر القواد الصليبيين الذين حكموا بيروت، «يوحنا الاول سيد ابلين»، الملقب «بسيد بيروت العجوز» (1179–1236) الذي قام بترميم المدينه بعد المعارك المتعدده مع صلاح الدين الايوبي، كما بنى قصر ال ابلين فيها. استعاد صلاح الدين الايوبي بيروت في سنه 1187، لكنها عادت الى الصليبيين بعد حوالي عشره اعوام، وبعد ان زالت الدوله الايوبيه وحلت مكانها دوله المماليك ارسل الملك الاشرف خليل ابن الملك قلاوون الصالحي جيشاً كبيراً الى المدينه فاستعادها وجعلها تابعه لنيابه طرابلس الشام التي كانت مرتبطه راساً بالقاهره مقر السلطه المملوكيّه انذاك.\n\nالعصور الحديثه\nفي سنه 1516 تغلب السلطان سليم الاول العُثماني على قنصوه الغوري سلطان المماليك وقضى عليه في معركه مرج دابق شمالي حلب، وتابع زحفه حتى احتل جميع بلاد الشام، ومن ذلك الحين دخلت بيروت في حوزه الدوله العثمانيه وكان اول حاكم عُثماني فيها محمد بن قرقماز (قرقماز اوغلو) وهو جركسي. حُكمت المدينه من قبل الامراء الدروز،  تاره من بني عسّاف وتاره من بني سيفا، ابتداءً من القرن السادس عشر، وفي تلك الفتره كانت بيروت مجرد قريه عاديه، بعد ان قل فيها التجار وضعفت الاعمال الصناعيه، والمهن البحريه، كالصيد وصناعه السفن وترميمها وتزويدها بالمؤن، وذلك اما لانتشار القراصنه في البحر المتوسط في ذلك الوقت، او لانصراف الكثير من القوافل البحريه الى الدوران حول افريقيا عن طريق راس الرجاء الصالح الذي اكتشف سنه 1498، فتحولت بذلك طريق التجاره مع الهند اليه بدلا من المرافئ اللبنانيه. وفي السنوات العشر الاخيره من القرن السادس عشر للميلاد، تغلب الامير فخر الدين بن معن على الامير يوسف بن سيفا الذي كان حاكماً على مدينه طرابلس وبلاد كسروان ومدينه بيروت وانتزع منه المقاطعه الكسروانيّه وبيروت وطرد من هذه المدينه الاغا الذي كان متسلماً عليها من طرف ابن سيفا. وقام فخر الدين خلال القرن السابع عشر بالاعتناء بعمران المدينه بشكل كبير، فازدهرت وانفتحت على اوروبا في ايامه، ومن المعالم التي انشاها: البرج الذي عُرف فيما بعد باسم برج الكشاف، لانه استُعمل مرقباً لاستكشاف المراكب المعاديه التي تحاول الاغاره على البلد، واليه تنسب ساحه البرج الواقعه في الجهه الشرقيه منه، والتي اصبحت تعرف اليوم بساحه الشهداء او ساحه الحريه، وكذلك انشا الامير قصراً له في بيروت بالاستعانه بخبرات بعض المهندسين الايطاليين، وحديقه للحيوانات، وقام بزياده عدد اشجار الصنوبر في حرج بيروت وتنسيق تلك الموجوده. وبعد زوال الاماره المعنيه عادت بيروت لتتبع ولايه طرابلس من جديد.\n\nفي السنوات الاخيره من القرن الثامن عشر شهدت بيروت صراعاً شديداً بين حاكمها الشهابي الامير يوسف وبين احد اتباعه احمد باشا الجزار، عندما كان كل منهما يحاول الاستئثار بها وتعرضت خلال هذا الصراع لاحتلالها من قبل اميرال البحر «سبنسكوف» الروسي، الذي كان يقوم باعمال القرصنه في المياه العثمانيّه لحساب امبراطوره روسيا كاترين الثانيه، فلقد نصّب هذا القرصان مدافع في سهلات البرج ليتمكن من ضرب سور المدينه من قرب، ولهذا السبب اطلق الافرنج على هذه السهلات اسم «ساحه المدفع»، ولكن احتلال الروس انتهى بعد شهور قليله بعد ان دفعت لهم المدينه غرامه قدرها 25 الف ريال بعمله ذلك الزمان. فعاد اليها الجزار وقبض على سيده السابق الامير يوسف الشهابي بمعاونه ابن اخ الاخير، الامير بشير الثاني الشهابي المشهور بالمالطي، واعدمه سنه 1790 في مدينه عكا. في ايام الجزار مُنع الشهابيون من الاقامه في بيروت، وهُدمت بيوتهم التي كانت فيها، كما مُنع اهل جبل لبنان من السكن في هذه المدينه التي الحقها الوالي المذكور بمدينه عكا التي اتخذها مركزاً له باسم ولايه عكا. والجزار هو الذي بنى السور الذي كان يحيط بيروت من كافه اطرافها ومنع الناس من السكن خارجه، فسجل انخفاض في عدد سكان المدينه الى 8,000 نسمه في تلك الفتره، وبقي هذا المنع سارياً حتى سنه 1832، ففي هذه السنه اقتحمها ابراهيم باشا بن محمد علي باشا وهدم السور واباح بناء المساكن خارجه، فعاد لبيروت دورها المهم مره اخرى.\nبقيت بيروت تحت الحكم المصري من سنه 1832 حتى 1841 وهي المده التي بقيت فيها بلاد الشام في حوزه ابراهيم باشا. وفي هذه الفتره عرفت هذه المدينه تطوراً اساسيًا شمل سائر مرافقها العُمرانيّه والاداريّه، ونما عدد سكانها يومئذٍ من 8 الاف نسمه الى 15 الفاً، وذلك بسبب امتداد رقعتها الى خارج السور الذي امر ابراهيم باشا بهدمه وسمح للناس ببناء مساكنهم في الضواحي التي اصبحت فيما بعد جزءاً من المدينه نفسها، كما ازدهرت احوالها التجاريّه بسبب اختيارها مركزاً للحجر الصحي، الامر الذي اجبر جميع القادمين الى الشام على الخضوع له للتاكد من سلامتهم الصحيّه وخلوهم من الامراض المعديّه. وخلال عهد المصريين كان حاكم بيروت هو القائد في الجيش المصري سليمان باشا الفرنساوي. في سنه 1841 تمكنت الدوله العُثمانيّه من استعاده سيطرتها على بلاد الشام، فقاموا بنقل كرسي الولايه اليها وعيّنوا عليها والياً من قبلهم اسمه سليم باشا. وفي عهد هذا الوالي بدات بيروت بالازدهار فازدادت عماراً وسكاناً، وانتقلت اليها تجاره الافرنج، وعظم شانها، وكثر مجيء المراكب الاوروبيّه اليها. وخلال احداث 1860 بين الدروز والمسيحيين، لجا الكثير من الموارنه النصارى الى بيروت هربا من المذابح في جبل لبنان ودمشق.\n\nخلال منتصف القرن التاسع عشر ازداد سكان بيروت وتوسعت المدينه لتتخطى اسوارها. وفي خضم هذا التوسع قامت الارساليات الغربيه ومفكرو العالم العربي بتكوين المدينه. واصبحت مركز الثقافه والفكر العربي ومركز تنوع عالمي بوجود الاوروبيين والاميركيين. فشركه المياه كانت بريطانيه وشركه امداد الغاز كانت فرنسيه فيما انشا الاميركيون المدارس والجامعات ومن اشهرها الجامعه الاميركيه في بيروت. واشتهرت فيها صناعات وتجاره الحرير. كما انشا الفرنسيون مرفا بحريا عصريا في سنه 1894 ومدوا سكك الحديد بين بيروت ودمشق وحلب في سنه 1907. وكانت السفن الفرنسيه تنقل البضائع بين بيروت ومارسيليا وسرعان ما اصبح للفرنسيين تاثير اكبر من اي دوله غربيه اخرى، وفي تلك الفتره اخذ السكان يقتدون بالاوروبين في بعض نواحي عيشهم وفي ملبسهم. ونشرت موسوعه بريتانيكا ان توزيع سكان بيروت في سنه 1911 كان كالتالي: مسلمون (36,000 نسمه)، مسيحيون (77,000 نسمه)، يهود (2,500 نسمه)، دروز (400 نسمه)، اجانب (4,100 نسمه).\n\nالمرحله المعاصره\nخلال الحرب العالميه الاولى عصفت المجاعه والامراض بجبل لبنان نتيجه لبعض التدابير العثمانيه الضاره، وبسبب مجريات الحرب، وكنتيجه لهذا لجا الكثير من ابناء الجبل الى بيروت للحصول على لقمه عيشهم، وفي تلك الفتره قام بعض الوجهاء البيروتيين بتاسيس بعض الجمعيات التي اخذت على عاتقها تقديم المساعدات والاغاثات للجبليين مما خفف من وطاه الحرب عليهم. وبتاريخ 8 اكتوبر 1918 سقطت المدينه من العثمانيين ووقعت بايدي قوات الحلفاء بقياده الجنرال ادموند النبي. واعلنت عصبه الامم بيروت خاضعه للانتداب الفرنسي مع بقيه مناطق جبل لبنان، البقاع وسوريا الكبرى. ثم اعلنها الفرنسيون في 1920 عاصمه لدوله لبنان الكبير، والتي اصبحت الجمهوريه اللبنانيه في سنه 1926 ولكن لم تنل استقلالها الا في سنه 1943. وازدهرت بيروت خلال فتره الاستقلال واصبحت نقطه استقطاب ثقافي واقتصادي لكل محيطها. فاصبحت بمثابه البلد الثاني او المصيف للعديد من مواطني العالم العربي. وشهدت بيروت اضطرابات لفتره بسيطه سنه 1958 زمن الرئيس كميل شمعون بسبب الصراع حول حلف بغداد، وخلال فتره الستينات من القرن العشرين اصبحت المدينه تعرف باسم «باريس الشرق». وبعد حرب 1967 مع اسرائيل، اصبحت بيروت مركزاً اساسياً للفدائيين الفلسطينيين الذين حاربوا الاخيره.\n\nسنوات الحرب الاهليه\nوفي العام 1975 اندلعت الحرب الاهليه اللبنانيه وقسمت المدينه الى شطرين: شرقي مسيحي، وغربي مسلم، وعم المدينه الخراب والفوضى. وقام الجيش الاسرائيلي في سنه 1978 باجتياح لبنان واحتلال اراضيه من الجنوب حتى نهر الليطاني في عمليه اعطاها الجيش الاسرائيلي اسم هذا النهر ثم توسع الاحتلال في لبنان بعد العدوان الاسرائيلي الثاني في سنه 1982 ليصل مشارف العاصمه ويحاصرها. وفي سنه 1983 تمّ تفجير الثكنات العسكريه الفرنسيه والاميركيه في المدينه. وفي سنه 1990 استقر الوضع في لبنان وتوحدت بيروت وعادت اليها حركه العمران بسرعه لتعود مركزا تجارياً وثقافياً مهماً للمنطقه العربيه من جديد بجهود جباره من رئيس الوزراء اللبناني الاسبق رفيق الحريري.\nبعد اتفاق الطائف وانتهاء الحرب اللبنانيه ومع تولي الرئيس رفيق الحريري الحكومه بدا اعمار بيروت واعادتها مجدداً الى الساحه الدوليه، فبدا باعمار وسط بيروت التي قامت شركه سوليدير ببنائه، وغدت بيروت مجدداً باريس الشرق حتى سنه 2005.\n\nاغتيال رفيق الحريري - الان\nاغتيل رفيق الحريري بتاريخ 14 فبراير سنه 2005، بانفجار عبوه ناسفه كانت مزروعه على طريق خليج السان جورج حيث كان موكبه يعبر، واسفر الانفجار عن اضرار جسيمه لحقت بالمباني المجاوره، وعن مقتل عدد من رفاق الحريري وعدد من المارّه. وفور ذيوع خبر وفاه الحريري سارت مظاهرات في عدد من شوارع بيروت اطلق فيها المتظاهرون شعارات ضد رئيس الجمهوريه اميل لحود ورئيس الحكومه عمر كرامي والنظام السوري ممثلاً بالرئيس بشار الاسد، وعقد اطراف المعارضه اللبنانيه اجتماعًا في داره الحريري خلص الى تحميل السلطه اللبنانيه والسلطه السوريه «بصفتها سلطه الوصايه» المسؤوليه عن الجريمه. ودعا المجتمعون الى رحيل السلطه القائمه وانسحاب القوات السوريه بالكامل قبل الانتخابات، واعلنوا عن اضراب شامل لثلاثه ايام. شكّل اغتيال رفيق الحريري بدايه لسلسله من الاغتيالات التي طالت سياسيين لبنانيين يعارضون الوجود السوري في البلاد، وقد اعتصمت القوى السياسيه المعارضه في وسط بيروت التجاري طيله شهران، اغلقت خلالها الكثير من المصالح، الى ان انصاع رئيس الحكومه عمر كرامي، وتنحى عن منصبه، ثم تلا ذلك انسحبًا للجيش السوري من لبنان بتاريخ 26 ابريل تحت ضغط مظاهرات مناصري ما عرف لاحقًا بتحالف 14 اذار وقرار الامم المتحده رقم 1559. بعد انسحاب الجيش السوري حصلت عدّه مجادلات سياسيه بين السلطه والمعارضه. وتخلل ذلك عدوان اسرائيلي في يوليو 2006 دُمرت خلاله البنيه التحتيه اللبنانيه.\nوفي 7 ايار 2008، قام مسلحو المعارضه في لبنان من حزب الله وحركه امل والحزب القومي السوري بالسيطره على بيروت كردّ فعل على اتخاذ الحكومه قراراً بتفكيك شبكه الاتصالات الخاصه بالمقاومه وبعزل مدير مطار بيروت الدولي حيث اعتبرت المعارضه هذا القرار خرقًا للبيان الوزاري القاضي بدعم المقاومه في مواجهه الاحتلال الاسرائيلي. وتلا هذه العمليه اتفاق في مدينه الدوحه ادى الى اخلاء وسط بيروت من مظاهر الاضراب واعاد الثقه بالسياحه اللبنانيه. وبتاريخ 18 اكتوبر 2008 تبادل لبنان وسوريا السفراء لاول مره في تاريخهما.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع بيروت على شبه جزيره تتجه لناحيه الغرب نحو البحر المتوسط، على بعد 94 كيلومتر (58 ميل) من شمال الحدود الفلسطينيه اللبنانيه. يحد المدينه من الشرق سلسله جبال لبنان الغربيه؛ وهي تتخذ شكلا مثلثا، بسبب وقوعها بين وعلى تلتين: تل الاشرفيه وتل المصيطبه.\nتبلغ مساحه محافظه بيروت 18 كم² (6.9 ميل مربّع)، بينما تبلغ مساحه التجمع الحضري للمدينه 67 كم² (26 ميل مربّع).يعتبر الشاطئ البحري لبيروت متنوعا، فهو صخري في شمال المدينه، ورملي في جنوبها، وفي بعض الاقسام من الشمال يكون الشاطئ عباره عن اجراف صخريه مرتفعه، كذلك فان هذه النماذج جميعها يمكن ان تندمج سويا في بعض الاماكن، مثل نقطه التقاء شاطئ الروشه بشاطئ الرمله البيضاء.\n\nالمناخ\nالطقس في بيروت معتدل اجمالا، اذ يسود المناخ المتوسطي المتمثل بفصل صيف حار عالي الرطوبه، وربيع وخريف معتدلين، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يعتبر اغسطس اكثر شهور السنه حرّا، حيث يمكن ان يصل معدل الحراره الى 29 ° مئويه (84 ° فهرنهايت)، كما يعتبر شهرا يناير وفبراير اكثرها برودهً، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحراره في الشهر الى 10 ° مئويه (50 ° فهرنهايت). يكون اتجاه الرياح غربيّا خلال فتره بعد الظهر والمساء، اي انه يهب من البحر الى اليابسه، اما في الليل، يتغير الاتجاه الى الشرق، اي انه يهب من اليابسه نحو البحر.\nيبلغ معدل الامطار السنويه في بيروت 860 ميليمتر (34.1 انش) والتي يتساقط معظمها خلال اشهر الشتاء، والقليل منها يتساقط في الخريف والربيع. تتساقط معظم الامطار خلال عدد محدود من الايام بشكل كثيف في العاده، اما الثلج فيندر ان يتساقط في بيروت، وبحال تساقط فانه لا يتراكم، ويُستثنى من ذلك شتاء السنوات 1920، 1942، و1950، حيث هبّت ثلاث عواصف ثلجيه كبيره على لبنان ادت الى هطول الثلوج على الساحل.\n\nمناطق بيروت\nتُقسم بيروت الى 12 حيّاً معترفاً به:\n\nالاشرفيه: عُرفت بهذا الاسم منذ حوالي سبعمائه سنه، اطلقت بعض النصوص عليها اسم «مزرعه الاشرفيه»، وقد سُميت بذلك تيمنًا بالسلطان المملوكي الاشرف صلاح الدين خليل. تقع على الهضبه الشرقيه البيروتيّه، وتشتهر بانها منطقه راقيه.\nعين المريسه: يرجع اصل اسمها الى «الريّسه»، اي المرسى الصغير بصيغه «المرسه»، اي قطعه من الحبل، والعين التي هي الينبوع الصغير الذي يصب بالبحر.\nالباشوره: احدى اقدم المناطق في بيروت، يرتقي عهدها الى عصر الخليفه المنصور، وقد اشتهرت بوجود المقبره الاسلاميه فيها التي تفصل نحله السور بينها وبين بيروت القديمه. يعني اسمها: البرج المتعالي الذي يقع على مدخل القلاع والمدن.\nميناء الحصن: في الاساس كانت تُدعى «ميناء الحسن»، ثم حُرفت مع الوقت فصارت السين تُلفظ صادًا. يُحتمل انها حملت هذا الاسم لوجود برج حصن بيروت في المنطقه في قديم الزمان.\nالمزرعه: تيمنًا بالمزارع التي كانت قائمه بها قديمًا وابرزها مزارع الحمضيات من ليمون وبرتقال.\nالمدوّر: تيمنًا باحدى العائلات البيروتيه.\nالمصيطبه: اصل الاسم يرجع الى «مسطبه بيدمر»، كانت بريّه تقع خارج اسوار بيروت القديمه لحين تحرير المماليك للساحل الشامي من الصليبيين، فحينها امر السلطان الاشرف صلاح الدين خليل، امر بتحويل بيروت الى قاعده بحريه والانطلاق منها لاستعاده قبرص. فبدا قاده الجيش والجند يستقرون في تلك المنطقه الخاليه، ومع مرور الوقت استحالت قريه بحد ذاتها قبل ان تلتحم مع بيروت.\nالمرفا: تيمنًا بمرفا المدينه القديم الذي ما زال قائمًا في هذه المنطقه.\nراس بيروت: كانت منطقه مقفره من السكان، ولم يقطنها الا بعض المزارعين الذين كانوا يتعاطون زراعه التين والصبار. سًميت كذلك لان قسمًا منها، وهو القسم الذي يدخل البحر، يشبه الراس في تكوينه. اخذت المنطقه تصبح اهله بالسكان بعد بناء الكليه السوريه الانجيليه عام 1865، وعدد من المعاهد والكليّات الاجنبيه، فتوافد البيارته القدماء عليها، واستقروا هناك، وما لبث ان استقطبت المنطقه عدد من الاجانب ايضًا الذين اختلطوا مع اهل المدينه الاصليين.\nالرميل: احدى الاحياء القديمه في المدينه، كان حيًا شعبيًا في بادئ الامر قبل ان ينمو ويستحيل منطقه ارستقراطيه، خاصه بعد اعاده بناءه عند انتهاء الحرب الاهليه اللبنانيه.\nالصيفي: يشتهر هذا الحي بمطاعمه ومقاهيه عربيه الطابع، ونزله القديم التي تعود للعهدين العثماني والفرنسي، ومرابعه ونواديه الليليه الحديثه.\nزقاق البلاط: احد الاحياء المستحدثه في القرن التاسع عشر، بعد تطوّر مدينه بيروت واستحداثها عاصمه ولايه. سُمي كذلك تيمنًا بزقاق طويل رُصفت ارضه بالبلاط. كان هذا الحي ذو طابع ارستقراطي، اذ قطنه البيارته الميسورين والموظفين الحكوميين العثمانيين من اتراك وشركس وارمن، اما اليوم فيُعد حيًا شعبيًا ذو طابع تراثي. تميز هذا الحي وما زال بتنوعه العرقي والطائفي، فالكثير من سكانه ذوي جذور عربيه، وبعضهم تركي وكردي وارمني الاصل، واغلب السكّان مسلمون يتبعون المذهبين السني والشيعي، وهناك قسم من السكان مسيحي يتبع كنيستيّ الروم والارمن الارثوذكس، وكان هناك وجود في السابق لعده اسر يهوديه.\nويُقسّم كل من هذه الاحياء الى مناطق عقاريه متعدده. تقع ثلاثه مخيمات للاجئين الفلسطينيين في بيروت من اصل 12 مخيما رسميا في لبنان، وهذه المخيمات هي: مخيم برج البراجنه، مخيم شاتيلا، ومخيم مار الياس، وجميعها تقع جنوبي المدينه. ومن بين الخمس عشر مخيمًا الغير رسميّه في لبنان، فان واحد منها منها، وهو مخيم صبرا، يقع في بيروت، بالقرب من مخيم شاتيلا.\n\nسكان بيروت\nتختلف تقديرات عدد سكان بيروت بشكل واسع، فهي تصل بحسب بعض الاحصاءات الى 938,940 نسمه، بينما تصل بالنسبه لاحصاءات اخرى الى 1,303,129 نسمه، والى 2,012,000 نسمه بالنسبه للبعض الاخر. ان غياب العدد الصحيح لسكان بيروت يعود الى انه لم يتم اي تعداد رسمي للسكان في لبنان منذ سنه 1932.\n\nالتركيبه العرقيّه\nتُعد بيروت، كغيرها من مدن بلاد الشام الكبرى، مدينه ذات مزيج عرقي كبير، يظهر جليًا في اسماء والقاب العائلات والاسر التي تقطنها حاليًا. وسبب هذا المزيج هو الشعوب المختلفه التي مرّت على الشام ككل، واستقر البعض منها واختلط مع ابناء البلاد، لكن على الرغم من ذلك يبقى واضحًا طغيان عنصر معيّن على بقيّه العناصر، فغالبيه البيارته من مسلمين ومسيحيين، هم من اصول عربيه سواء من توطن منهم فيها قبل الفتح الاسلامي، او في ظل تلك الفتوح، كما شهدت بيروت موجات جديده من الهجرات العربيه سواء من المشرق العربي او من المغرب العربي. وقد شهد عهدا الخلافه العربيه بما فيها العهد الفاطمي والزنكي والايوبي والمملوكي والصليبي هجره الكثير من الاعاجم واستقرارهم في بيروت، وكذلك كان الحال في عهد الخلافه العثمانيه. كما شهدت القرون السابقه والقرن العشرين العديد من النزوح من المناطق اللبنانيه الى بيروت خاصهً.\n\nكانت بيروت قبيل الفتح الاسلامي ماهوله من قبل العرب والسريان والروم، وعندما فتح المسلمون الساحل الشامي شهدت المدينه قدوم العديد من العناصر العسكريه والمدنيه التي تنتمي الى قبائل عربيه، وقد توطنت في بيروت، ومنها من حافظت على اسماء قبائلها، في حين ان البعض الاخر اتخذ اسماء جديده هي عباره عن القاب وصفات ومهن، ومن القبائل العربيه التي استوطنت بيروت: بنو حزم وبنو مخزوم وبنو قيس وبنو زيدان، وسواهم، وتفرّعت منهم اسر عديده. من ابرز اصول البيارته المعاصرين الاصول المغربيه والاندلسيه، وقد بدا المغاربه والاندلسيين يتوافدون الى بلاد الشام ومدنها خلال العهد الصليبي، فقد انتقل الاف المغاربه من بلادهم الى الشام للمشاركه في الجهاد ضد الصليبيين، ووقع الكثير منهم اسرى، وقد حرص التجار والامراء والسلاطين المسلمين على فك اسرهم نظرًا لما قدّموه من تضحيات، ومنحوهم منحًا ماليه ووطنوهم في المدن وادخلوهم في حاشيتهم. كما ان قسمًا كبيرًا منهم اتى بغرض طلب العلم. اما القسم الاعظم من المغاربه والاندلسيين، فقد وصل بيروت عقب سقوط الاندلس سنه 1492، وعقب الاحتلال الفرنسي لبلدان المغرب اواخر القرن التاسع عشر، وطرد الكثير من السكّان بهدف توطين فرنسيين بدلاً منهم. كذلك يظهر جليًا الاصل المصري لبعض العائلات البيروتيه، من خلال تلقبها باسم المدينه او البلده التي وصلوا منها، مثل: الاسكندراني والرشيدي، والجيزي، واغلب البيارته ذوي الاصول المصريه وصلوا المدينه خلال عهد الحكم المصري لبلاد الشام. اما باقي الاسر البيروتيه ذات الجذور العربيه فاصولها عراقيه وشاميّه مجاوره وحجازيه ويمنيه.\n\nتعرضت بيروت ومختلف بلاد الشام لموجات هجره مدنيه وعسكريه في العهود الايوبيه والمملوكيه والعثمانيه، خاصه وان هذه العهود صاحبتها مجيء عشرات الالاف من العساكر المقاتله، بالاضافه الى ان حكّام وسلاطين هذه العهود كانوا يعمدون الى اسكان الجيوش بكثره في المناطق الخاضعه لهم للدفاع عنها وصبغها بلون واحد. وبناءً على ذلك تعرضت بيروت خلال تلك العهود لهجرات وموجات سكانيه تمازجت مع العائلات البيروتيه القديمه وتصاهرت معها، ومن ابرز الاعاجم الذين سكنوا بيروت: الاتراك والايرانيين والاكراد والشركس والالبان، واليونان، والارمن. ومن هذه العائلات من احتفظ باسمه الاصلي، واغلبها اتخذ اسماءً والقاب جديده تدل على اصوله مثل: الاصفهاني، والارناؤوط (من البانيا)، والبوشناق، وجركس، والمورللي، والكردي، والازمرلي، وغيرها. كذلك شهدت بيروت بعد انتهاء الحرب العالميه الاولى قدوم عساكر من مسلمي الهند قدموا مع الجيش البريطاني. وقد استقر بعضهم في بيروت وحملوا اسم عائله «الهندي». ايضًا هناك قلّه نادره من البيارته ترجع باصولها الى افريقيا جنوب الصحراء الكبرى، وهؤلاء يتحدرون من الرقيق الاسود، الذي كانت تجارته ناشطه الى نهايه الدوله العثمانيه، ومن الجنود السنغال الذين عملوا في الجيش الفرنسي طيله فتره الانتداب. وقد تمازج هؤلاء وتفاعلوا مع البيارته منذ اوائل القرن العشرين، لذلك فقد ضاعوا تقريبًا في المزيج البيروتي.\n\nالتركيبه الطائفيّه\nتعتبر بيروت اكثر مدن لبنان غنى بالتنوع الديني والمذهبي، ويُحتمل ايضا ان تكون اكثر مدن الشرق الاوسط غنى بهذا التنوع، اذ ان لكل من المسلمين والمسيحيين وجود فعّال فيها. هناك 9 طوائف رئيسيّه في بيروت هي: السنّه، الشيعه، الدروز، الموارنه، الروم الارثوذكس، الروم الكاثوليك، الارمن الارثوذكس، الارمن الكاثوليك، البروتستانت. يتولى الفصل في المنازعات والقضايا الدينيه، او قضايا الاحوال الشخصيه، القضاء الديني المختص بالنسبه لكل طائفه على حدى. ان المطالبه بالزواج المدني في لبنان قوبلت بالرفض من قبل رؤساء الطوائف الروحيه حتى الان، ولكن الحكومه تعترف بالزواج المدني الذي انعقد في الخارج. يعيش في بيروت حاليا عدد قليل من اليهود، ولكن في السابق كان هناك نسبه كبيره نسبيا من اليهود تسكن في حي وادي ابو جميل بوسط بيروت، ولا يزال الكنيس اليهودي قائما هناك حتى اليوم. ومن اثار اليهود الباقيه في بيروت ايضا المقبره اليهوديه الواقعه في القسم الشرقي من المدينه، والتي دُفن فيها ايضا بعض الجنود الفرنسيين الذين خدموا في لبنان ايام الانتداب.\nويتوزع سكان بيروت على الشكل التالي: مسلمون:65% (السنّه:80%، الشيعه:12%، الدروز:8%)، مسيحيون:30% (الموارنه:40%، الروم الارثوذكس:40%، الروم الكاثوليك:12%، الارمن:8%)، اقليات ويهود:5%.\nكان للحرب الاهليه اللبنانيه تاثير على ديمغرافيه السكان وتوزع الطوائف في بيروت، فقبل الحرب كانت الاحياء السكنيه اكثر اختلاطاً بالمذاهب المختلفه، اما اليوم فان كل قسم من بيروت يطغى عليه طابع معين، فبيروت الشرقيه اكثر سكانها مسيحيون، مع اقليّه سنيّه، بينما بيروت الغربيه اكثر سكانها مسلمون سنّه، وفيها اقليّه مسيحيه وشيعيّه. ويُلاحظ اليوم ان انتقال السكان المسيحيين والمسلمين من والى القسم الغربي والشرقي من المدينه عاد على نحو بسيط. يسكن ضاحيه بيروت الجنوبيه اكثريه شيعيّه، مع وجود اقليّه صغيره من السنّه والمسيحيين. كان لبيروت تاريخ من عدم الاستقرار السياسي كنتيجه للانقسامات الطائفيه، كما لعب الدين دوراً في السابق في تقسيم المجتمع اللبناني، كما يتضح من الحرب الاهليه الاخيره.\n\nاللاجئون والعمّال\nكان الارمن من اول اللاجئين الى بيروت في المرحله المعاصره، وبدا وصول الارمن الى لبنان سنه 1915 بعد ارتكاب المذابح بحقهم من قبل الاتراك، واول منطقه سكنوها كانت منطقه الكرنتينا ومن ثم برج حمود، حيث لا يزال المتحدرين منهم يقيمون هناك حتى اليوم. كانت بيروت احدى المدن الرئيسيه في لبنان التي سكنها اللاجئون الفلسطينيون سنه 1948، كذلك هناك عدد كبير من السوريين والمصريين الذين يقطنون المدينه ويعمل معظمهم في قطاع الخدمات والبناء. وبعد الغزو الامريكي للعراق سنه 2003، قدم لبنان حوالي 100,000 عراقي وسكن الكثير منهم في بيروت، الا ان الحكومه ابعدت قسرا جزءاً كبيرا منهم او قامت بسجنهم بسبب وصولهم بطريقه غير شرعيه.\nبالاضافه لذلك هناك عدد كبير من المهاجرين غير العرب في بيروت مثل الافغان، الايرانيين، والباكستانيين، كما شهدت السنوات الاخيره تزايدا في اعداد القادمين من الحبشه، وبلدان جنوب شرق اسيا، مثل اندونيسيا، الفلبين، ماليزيا، وسريلانكا، ويعمل هؤلاء في العاده كخدم في المنازل او المكاتب، والبعض يُباشر اعمالا خاصه به، مثل الايرانيين الذين يعملون اجمالا في صناعه السجاد العجمي.\n\nالخدمات الاقتصاديه والتجاريه والصناعيه والصحيه\nالاقتصاديه\nتستقطب مدينه بيروت رجال الاعمال من لبنانيين وعرب واجانب، وتتدفق الى مصارفها تحويلات من كل انحاء العالم. لذلك هي مركز مصرف لبنان وبورصته، وتحتل المركز المصرفي الاول في الشرق الاوسط، من هنا اتخذت مركزاً لاتحاد المصارف العربيه، وساعد في ذلك السريه المصرفيه التي يتبعها لبنان.\n\nالعمله والمصارف\nكان اللبنانيون عموما يتعاملون بالليره العثمانيه ايام الحكم العثماني، وكان الناس يرمزون الى العمله باسم «العثمليّه» او «الليره العثمليّه»، وخلال عهد الحكم المصري في لبنان (1831-1840)، وفي السنوات اللاحقه بعده، تعامل البيروتيين بالعمله المصريه، وكانوا يرمزون اليها «بالمصريه»، ومن هذه العمله اكتسبت النقود لفظتيّ «مصاري» و«مصريات» اللتين لا تزالان تستعملان حتى اليوم في بيروت وكافه انحاء لبنان وسوريا بمعنى نقود.\nبعد ان خضع لبنان للانتداب الفرنسي، اصدر الجنرال هنري غورو، المفوض السامي الفرنسي في سوريا ولبنان، نقدا خاصا لكلا البلدين، وقد حصر الاصدار «ببنك سوريا ولبنان»، وكان هذا المصرف فرنسيّا مقره باريس، وربطت حكومه الانتداب النقد اللبناني بالفرنك الفرنسي الذي كانت قيمته قد انخفضت كثيرا انذاك، وجعلت الليره وحده العمله اللبنانيه وقسمتها الى مائه قرش، وبهذا ظهرت الليره اللبنانيه. وبعد زوال الانتداب حصلت قطيعه اقتصاديه بين لبنان وسوريا بتاريخ 15 مارس 1950 بسبب تباين وجهات النظر الاقتصاديه بين الدولتين، فكان هذا حافزا للحكومه اللبنانيه كي تعيد تنظيم اقتصاد الدوله، فانشات في اوائل ستينات القرن العشرين «مصرف لبنان» او «البنك المركزي» الذي حلّ مكان بنك سوريا ولبنان في اصدار النقد اللبناني.\n\nنشطت حركه المصارف بسبب الازدهار الاقتصادي خلال فتره الستينات واوائل السبعينات، فبعد ان كان عدد المصارف لا يزيد عن عشره بعد الاستقلال، ارتفع في فتره الازدهار الى قرابه المئه، وقد اختيرت مدينه بيروت سنه 1974 مركزا لاتحاد المصارف العربيه، وتشجيعا لهذا القطاع الاقتصادي، اقرت الحكومه قانون السريه المصرفيه املهً في اجتذاب الودائع الكبيره من لبنان والبلاد العربيه، وقد اعطت هذه السياسه ثمارها وظهرت نتائجها في المبالغ الطائله التي اودعت في المصارف اللبنانيه في بيروت، والتي بلغت في بعض الاوقات ما يزيد عن 6 مليارات ليره. ومن المصارف التي تتخذ من بيروت مقرا رئيسيّا لها: بنك بيروت، بنك بلوم، بنك بيبلوس، بنك عوده، بنك لبنان والمهجر، بالاضافه لعدد من البنوك المشتركه مع بعض الدول العربيه مثل البنك اللبناني الكويتي والبنك اللبناني المصري، وغير العربيه كالبنك اللبناني الكندي، كما توجد بعض الفروع لمصارف اوروبيه مثل البنك البريطاني (HSBC).\nعلى الرغم من الازمه الاقتصاديه العالميه (2007 و2009 والمستمرّه حتى الان)، فان مصارف لبنان لم تتاثر بها بشكل يذكر، وبالتالي فان قيمه الليره اللبنانيه بقيت مستقره نسبيّا، ويعود ذلك الى الاجراءات الصارمه التي تتبع عند منح القروض وغيرها من المدفوعات، والتي نصّ عليها وفرضها حاكم مصرف لبنان، رياض سلامه. حصل الاخير على جائزه «افضل حاكم مصرف مركزي لسنه 2009»، كونه كان قادرا على منع وصول الاثار السلبيه للازمه الاقتصاديه العالميه الى لبنان، كما كان قد حصل على نفس الجائزه سنه 2006.\n\nبورصه بيروت\nبورصه بيروت هي سوق الاوراق الماليه الوحيده العامله في لبنان. تعتبر بورصه بيروت واحده من اقدم الاسواق الماليه في المنطقه حيث يعود تاريخ تاسيسها لسنه 1920، تحت سلطه الانتداب الفرنسي، وكانت ثاني اقدم سوق ماليه في العالم العربي. وفي اوائل الخمسينات تميز، الاقتصاد اللبناني بنشاط ملحوظ حيث بدات شركات صناعيه ومصرفيه وخدماتيه تدخل البورصه لتجعل من بورصه بيروت افضل سوق مالي في المنطقه مع دخول حوالي خمسين شركه. مع اندلاع الاحداث اللبنانيه سنه 1975 تراجعت حركه التداول في بورصه بيروت، ومع تدهور الوضع الامني، علق العمل في البورصه من سنه 1983، ولم تعاود نشاطها حتى 22 ديسمبر 1996، اي بعد 13 عاما. في نهايه سنه 2006 اطلقت بورصه بيروت نظام تداول جديد عن بعد، يسمح للوسطاء بتداول الصكوك المدرجه على بورصه بيروت عن بعد من مكاتبهم الخاصه. وفي 13 فبراير 2008 قررت البورصه الاجازه باعتماد التداول الالكتروني «عن بعد» على بورصه بيروت عبر الانترنت وذلك حصراً من خلال شركات الوساطه المعتمده في البورصه. تقع بورصه بيروت اليوم في وسط المدينه التجاري، بعد ان نُقل مقرها الى هناك سنه 2002.\n\nمرفا بيروت\nتعد بيروت مركزًا لاحد اهم واكبر الموانئ الواقعه شرق البحر المتوسط وهو مرفا بيروت؛ حيث ان موقعه وعمق المياه فيه يتيح له ان يستقبل اكبر المراكب وسفن الشحن. فقد ظهر ان القسم المخصص منه لتخزين الحاويات كان يعمل ويحوي ما يزيد عن العدد العادي الذي يُفترض به ان يحويه، لاكثر من 10 سنوات، قبل ان تظهر الدراسات انه يقدر ان يحوي هذا المقدار. كما وتوجد المقرات الرئيسيّه للعديد من المصارف والشركات اللبنانيه في بيروت، وبعض فروع الاجنبيه منها.\n\nالخدمات التجاريه\nتشكل التجاره جزءاً من طبيعه البيروتيين الذين اكتشفوا منذ القدم اهميه موقع مدينتهم المرفئيه، كجمال التقاء بين الشرق والغرب يتمتع بميزات تسهم في انجاح المبادرات التجاريه على اختلافها. فغدت بيروت مركزاً مالياً وتجارياً وصناعياً مرموقاً يتعاطى جميع النشاطات الماليه والخدمات المصرفيه بالاضافه الى نشاطات اخرى متعدده في قطاعات البناء والتجاره والاستيراد والتصدير والصناعه.\nوتتمركز في بيروت المؤسسات الاقتصاديه والتجاريه الكبرى لتامين الخدمات واستثمار المشاريع الانشائيه، ما وفر العمل للعديد من اللبنانيين، وجلب العديد من المستهلكين اليها، وقد ساعد في ذلك اعتماد لبنان النظام الراسمالي الحر، واقراره قانون السريه المصرفيه وتوسيع وتطوير كل من مطار بيروت الدولي ومرفا بيروت والمنطقه الحره في كل من هذين المرفقين الحيويين الذين يعتبران عن حق بدايه الشرق ومنفذاً للدول العربيه على البحر المتوسط، وجسر الغرب الصناعي للشرق الاستهلاكي.\n\nجمعيّه تجّار بيروت\nتاسست جمعيه تجـار بيروت سنه 1921 واعترف بها رسـمياً بموجب رخصـه رسـميه مؤرخه في ابريل 1921. وكان الهدف الاساسي للمؤسسين العمل على توحيد جهود التجار في مدينه بيروت والتي كانت ركن الاساس للتجاره اللبنانيه، وتنسيق مساعيهم في خدمه مهنتهم والاعتناء بالوسائل التي من شانها حمايه التجاره اللبنانيه وتشجيعها ورفع مستواها والدفاع عن مصالحها ومصالح اعضائها والعمل على تقدمها وتقدمهم من جميع النواحي الاقتصاديه، والعمل على ايجاد المشاريع التجاريه وتنشيطها على اختلاف انواعها والسعي لتعزيز مدينه بيروت الاقتصادي وانشاء مكتب للاستعلامات التجاريه وناد لتعارف التجار توثيقاً للروابط بينهم والتوسط لدى السلطات الرسميه والدوائر الحكوميه لرفع كل حيف يقع عليهم والعمل لكل ما يعود بالنفع على الجمعيه عموماً.\n\nالخدمات الصناعيه\nتتمركز في بيروت وضواحيها 66% من المؤسسات الصناعيه اللبنانيه نظراً الى سهوله الحصول على المواد الاوليه عبر مرفا بيروت بالاضافه الى توافر اليد العامله.\n\nالخدمات الصحيه\nفي بيروت اهم المستشفيات اللبنانيه واكثرها تجهيزاً وكفايه معظم الجهاز الطبي اللبناني، فضلاً عن المستوصفات والصيدليات ومستودعات الادويه. اشتهرت في الماضي بانها مستشفى العرب، وبعد الحرب عادت تدريجياً الى موقعها المرموق وياتي اليها العديد من العرب خصوصاً للحصول على الطبابه المميزه. ومن ابرز مستشفيات بيروت: مستشفى الجامعه الاميركيه، مستشفى رزق، مستشفى اوتيل ديو، ومستشفى المقاصد.\n\nبيروت الرسميه\nيقع البرلمان اللبناني في العاصمه بيروت، وكذلك السراي الكبير، مقر الحكومه. تحوي بيروت ايضا جميع الوزارات ومعظم الادارات الرسميّه، السفارات والقنصليات. بيروت هي احدى المحافظات السته اللبنانيه، والخمسه الاخرى هي: البقاع، لبنان الشمالي، لبنان الجنوبي، جبل لبنان، والنبطيه.\n\nبلديّه بيروت\nتتكون بلديه بيروت من مجلس البلديّه ولجان ذلك المجلس. يتالف مجلس البلديه من رئيس البلديه ونائبه واعضاء المجلس البالغ عددهم 24 شخصا. اما لجان المجلس فقد حدد القانون عددها بست عشره لجنه هي: لجنه المناقصات، لجنه المال والاداره، لجنه متابعه مقررات المجلس البلدي، اللجنه القانونيه، لجنه الحدائق والصحه والبيئه، لجنه التخطيط والاشغال والاملاك والاستملاكات، لجنه الاعلام والعلاقات العامه، لجنه تسميه الشوارع والسير والاناره والنقل، لجنه الشؤون الاجتماعيه والثقافيه والرياضيه، ولجنه المؤسسات المصنفه. يشمل الجدول ادناه اسماء محافظو بيروت من عام 1936 الى الوقت الحاضر: كامل عبّاس حميّه (1936 – 1941)، نقولا رزق الله (1946 – 1952)، جورج عاصي (1952 – 1956)، بشّور حدّاد (1956 – 1958)، فيليب بولس (1959 – 1960)، اميل ينّي (1960 – 1967)، شفيق ابو حيدر (1967 – 1977)، متري النمّار (1977 – 1987)، جورج سماحه (1987 – 1991)، نايف المعلوف (1992 – 1995)، نقولا سابا (1995 – 1999)، يعقوب الصرّاف (1999 – 2005)، ناصيف قالوش (2005 – 2014)، زياد شبيب (2014 –).\n\nالمنظمات الدوليه\nتتخذ بعض المنظمات الدوليه من بيروت مقرّاً لها، ومن ذلك لجنه الامم المتحده الاقتصاديه والاجتماعيه لغربي اسيا (الاسكوا، ESCWA) المتمركزه في وسط بيروت التجاري. وكذلك فهناك مكاتب اقليميه في المدينه لكل من منظمه العمل الدوليه (ILO)، ومنظمه الامم المتحده للتربيه والعلم والثقافه (اليونسكو، UNESCO)، والتي تغطي كافه انحاء العالم العربي. بالاضافه لذلك، يقع المقر الرئيسي للاتحاد العربي للنقل الجوي (AACO) في بيروت ايضاً.\n\nالتعليم\nالتعليم الاساسي\nينتشر في بيروت عدد من المدارس الخاصه، ومن اشهرها: الانترناشونال كولدج، بيروت (الكليّه العالميه في بيروت، IC)، كليه لويس فاغمان، مدرسه الجاليه الاميركيه في بيروت، ثانويه الروضه، كليه السيده الارثوذكسيه، الكليه الفرنسيه البروتستانتيه (بالفرنسيه: Collège Protestant Français)، مدرسه القلب الاقدس - الجميّزه (بالفرنسيه: Collège du Sacré-Coeur Gemmayzé)، الثانويه الفرنسيه اللبنانيه الكبرى (بالفرنسيه: Grand Lycée Franco-Libanais). كذلك هناك بعض الجمعيّات الخيريهّ التي تُنشا المدارس الخاصه مثل جمعيه المقاصد الخيريه الاسلاميه، والتي انشات عدّه مدارس خاصه في بيروت بقي منها 8 اليوم، ومن اهمها كليه المقاصد للبنات وكليه خالد بن الوليد.\n\nيعتمد انتقال الطالب الى مرحله التعليم العالي على حصوله على شهاده البكالوريا اللبنانيه، ولكن يُقبل ايضا بالبكالوريا الفرنسيه، باعتبار انه تمت مساواتها بتلك اللبنانيه، ويحصل الشخص على هذه الشهاده عن طريق نجاحه في امتحانات الثانويه العامه الرسميه. تعتبر البكالوريا الفنيه او المهنيه بديلا عن تلك العاديه بالنسبه لمن درس في المعاهد الفنيه.\n\nالتعليم العالي\nيؤمن التعليم العالي في بيروت، وجميع انحاء لبنان، عدد من المعاهد المهنيه ومؤسسات التعليم العادي، مثل الكليّات الجامعيه، المؤسسات الجامعيه، والجامعات. ومن بين كل صروح العلم هذه المنتشره عبر الدوله، فان الجامعه اللبنانيه هي مؤسسه التعليم العالي الرسميّه الوحيده التي تقع في العاصمه. تُدار جميع الكليّات والجامعات في بيروت ولبنان من قبل وزاره التربيه والتعليم العالي، ويعتبر الوزير المختص مسؤولا عن وضع البرامج التعليميه وتقرير موعد الامتحانات الرسميّه وصيانه هذه المؤسسات والحفاظ عليها بشكل عام.\nهناك عدد كبير من الطلاب الاجانب الذين يكملون دراساتهم العليا في بيروت، واكثرهم من الخليج العربي وسوريا والعراق، والبعض من ايران واوروبا، وينبغي على اي اجنبي من الذين يرغبون بمتابعه تعليمهم العالي في لبنان ان يستوفي المؤهلات المطلوبه في اللبنانيين انفسهم، فيجب اولا ان تكون شهادته الثانويه معادله للبكالوريا اللبنانيه كي يسمح له بالتسجيل في اي مؤسسه تعليم عالي. لا يخضع الطلاب الاجانب لاي نظام محاصصه، وتُقدم الحكومه المنح الدراسيّه ضمن نطاق الاتفاقات الثانئيه التي عُقدت مع الدوله الام للطالب الاجنبي او الدوله التي يرغب الطالب اللبناني بالتعلّم فيها. وعند حصول اي لبناني او اجنبي على شهاده اجنبيه، فانه يجب التصديق عليها من قبل السفاره اللبنانيه في ذلك البلد ووزاره الخارجيه في لبنان، ومن ثم يبقى على الاجنبي المرشح للدخول في المؤسسه التعليميه ان يذهب بنفسه ومعه المستندات المطلوبه لاكمال اجراءات التسجيل في الجامعه او المعهد الذي ينشده.\nتعتبر بيروت مركزا لبعض اهم واشهر الجامعات في الشرق الاوسط، مثل الجامعه الاميركيه في بيروت، جامعه القديس يوسف، المعهد العالي للاعمال، والجامعه اللبنانيه الاميركيه، وبعض الجامعات والكليّات ذات الاهميه المحليه مثل جامعه بيروت العربيه، والجامعه الاميركيه للعلوم والتكنولوجيا.\n\nالعمران\nان النظام المعماري في بيروت في العهد العثماني يعتبر من اجمل ملامح التراث البيروتي واللبناني والعربي والعثماني، وتشهد الاثار العُثمانيّه المتبقيه من منازل ودور وقصور وسرايات وثكن ومدارس ومساجد، جمال وروعه هذا التراث. وعلى سبيل المثال فان النشاطات الاقتصاديّه كانت ممثله بالاسواق التجاريّه والصناعيّه والحرفيّه، من بين هذه الاسواق على سبيل المثال والتي كانت قائمه منذ العهد العُثماني: سوق الاساكفه، سوق البازركان، سوق العطارين، سوق الحدادين، وكثير غيرها. كانت بيوت البيارته في تلك الفتره متواضعه بشكل عام، سقوفها مدعمه بالجسور الخشبيّه، وكان يصعد الى الطابق العلوي بواسطه سلم حجر داخلي وسلم حجر خارجي، علماً ان بعض البيوت الاخرى كانت سلالمها مصنوعه من الاخشاب، اما المساطب فكانت نمطاً معمارياً تقليدياً موجود امام بيوت بيروت كافه، كما وجدت في بيروت القديمه وفي ضواحيها القريبه بعض البيوت المتواضعه التي بنيت كلها من الخشب، وكانت تبطن الجدران الخشبيه بصفائح من القصدير او الزنك لمنع الهواء من الدخول الى المنازل.\n\nوبشكل عام فان بيروت في القرن التاسع عشر كانت تتميز بمنازل سقوفها من القرميد الاحمر الموضوع فوق السقوف الخشبيه، وبغرف واسعه ذات سقوف عاليه، وايوان جميل متسع يُسمّى المنزول وهو ما يُعرف حاليّا بالصالون او غرفه الاستقبال. وكان يتخلل المنازل شبابيك شرعيّه، وفتحات زجاجيّه مرتفعه مصنوعه من الزجاج الملون وفي غالبيه منازل بيروت شرفات في الطابق الاول، في اعلاها فتحات زجاجيّه مصنوعه من الزجاج الملّون، كما يتخلل الغرف بعض فتحات التهوئه، وكانت المنازل البيروتيّه تضّم عاده عليّه التي تُعرف محليا باسم «المتخّت» او «التتخيته» التي يعلوها عاده القافعه التي يصعد منها الى سطح المنزل، حيث السطيحه التي يظللها العرزال ومسابك زهور الفل والزنبق والرياحين والياسمين.\nوفي فتره لاحقه تاثر البيروتيين بنمط العماره الاوروبي، فاخذت البيوت ذات طابع العماره الايطاليه والفرنسيه تنتشر بالمدينه شيئا فشيئا حتى استبدلت الكثير من المباني ذات الطابع العربي او العثماني. وفي فتره لاحقه، ومع ازدياد الكثافه السكانيه، اخذ الناس يبنون العمارات المتعدده الطوابق فحلت مكان معظم الابنيه التقليديه لدرجه ان اي حي سكني به عماره قديمه من ايام العثمانيين والفرنسيين تصنفه البلديه على انه «حي ذو طابع تراثي». وبعد انتهاء الحرب الاهليه، قامت شركه «سوليدير» باعاده بناء وسط المدينه المدمر، فبنت معظم المناطق السكنيه في تلك المنطقه على الطراز الاوروبي.\n\nمعالم المدينه\nالمواصلات\nان استعمال وسائل المواصلات حاجه ضروريه يوميه بالنسبه لكل من يسكن المدينه او خارجها، على الرغم من صغر حجمها. تُقسّم وسائل النقل في بيروت الى مواصلات بريه، بحريه، وجويّه.\n\nالمواصلات البريه\nتتصل بيروت بغيرها من المدن اللبنانيه والمدن السوريه الرئيسيّه، عن طريق الحافلات التي يتبع كل منها شبكه طرقات معينه في تنقله. وتتمركز الحافلات التي تنقل الركاب الى شمال لبنان وسوريا في محطه شارل حلو الواقعه في شمال بيروت. وفي بيروت شركتين رئيسيتين تقدم خدمات النقل للمواطنين: الاولى هي الشركه اللبنانيه للمواصلات (LCC)، وهي شركه خاصه تؤمن النقل بداخل المدينه وبعض الضواحي، وهي تتبع 10 طرقات رئيسيّه تغطي معظم المنطقه المركزيه لبيروت. اما الشركه الثانيه، فهي مصلحه سكك الحديد والنقل المشترك، وهي شركه عامّه، تتبع حافلاتها 12 خطّا رئيسيّا في المدينه.\nبالاضافه الى الحافلات، التي تستخدمها طبقه واسعه من الشعب وخصوصا ابناء الطبقات الفقيره بسبب التعرفه البخسه، تنتشر في بيروت سيارات الاجره والسرفيس، والاخيره عباره عن اجره ارخص بكثير من الاجره العاديه، وتعرفتها محدده مسبقا، وهي تصل حاليّا في بيروت الى 100,000 ليره لبنانيه، والغالب ان يستقل الناس سياره الاجره باعتبار انها «سرفيس»، ولتفادي اي سوء تفاهم فقد جرت العاده على ان يخبر الراكب السائق بالمكان الذي يقصده، فاذا كان بعيدا تعتبر الاجره عاديّه، وان كان ضمن حدود المدينه تعتبر «سرفيس». كذلك تُستعمل الميكروباصات في نقل الافراد من بيروت الى بعض البلدات والقرى والمدن اللبنانيه.\nوفي فتره سابقه، كان الترامواي ايضا يؤدي خدمه النقل بداخل المدينه، وقد جرى الاحتفال بتدشين خط الترامواي ببيروت في شهر سبتمبر سنه 1907 بمناسبه المولد السلطاني للعام الثامن والتسعين، وكان ذلك في عهد الوالي ابراهيم خليل باشا.، وتوقف العمل به في مايو 1964، بعد ان اصدرت الحكومه قرارها بذلك، وسيّرت الحافلات بدلا منه، بعد ان درّبت سائقي الترامواي على قياده السيارات الجديده.\n\nالمواصلات البحريه\nان مرفا بيروت هو اكبر مرافئ لبنان واحد اهم المرافئ الواقعه شرق البحر المتوسط، وهو فضلا عن استقباله المراكب والسفن التجاريه، يستقبل العبّارات التي يمكن الانتقال فيها من والى قبرص والمرافئ اللبنانيه الاخرى بالاضافه للمرافئ السوريه والمصريه وغيرها من المرافئ المجاوره.\n\nالمواصلات الجويّه\nيقع مطار بيروت رفيق الحريري الدولي في الضاحيه الجنوبيه للمدينه، ويتصل بوسط العاصمه عبر طريق المطار. وقد تم افتتاحه سنه 1954، وفي هذه الفتره كان يُعرف بمطار بيروت الدولي، وقد تعرض المطار على مر السنين لعدد من العوائق كان ابرزها الحرب الاهليه اللبنانيه التي اوقفت جميع عمليات السفر تقريبا وادت لتدمير منشاته وتوقفه عن العمل، وبعد انتهاء الحرب قام رئيس الوزراء انذاك، رفيق الحريري باعاده بنائه، وبعد استشهاد الاخير سُمي المطار على اسمه. يتعامل المطار مع 47 شركه طيران عربيه وعالميه و8 شركات شحن جوي.\n\nالثقافه\nتعتبر ثقافه بيروت الحاليه مزيجا من ثقافات متنوعه ومتعدده لمختلف الشعوب والحضارات التي مرّت على المدينه، بما فيها اليونانيون والرومان (ثقافه حوض البحر المتوسط)، العرب والاتراك (ثقافه عربيه اسلاميه)، والفرنسيون (ثقافه اوروبيه). يُعتقد ان مدرسه الحقوق التي انشات في المدينه ايام الامبراطوريه الرومانيه كانت اول مدرسه قانون في العالم. ان تاريخ الكوسموبوليتيه هذا يعد مصدر فخر للبنانيين عموما والبيروتيين خصوصا.\nاستضافت بيروت قمه الفرانكوفونيه وجامعه الدول العربيه سنه 2002، وحفل تقديم جائزه البير لوندر، الذي يقدم جوائز للصحافيين الفرانكوفونيين المميزين كل سنه. استضافت المدينه ايضا الالعاب الفرانكوفونيه في عام 2009. تعتبر بيروت عاصمه الكتاب العالميه للامم المتحده لسنه 2009، تقديرا لغناها الثقافي.\n\nاللكنه\nاللكنه البيروتيه هي احدى فروع اللهجه اللبنانيه. وهي لكنه عربيه اصيله ما تزال ملامحها وصفاتها متجذره حتى اليوم في المجتمع البيروتي، ويُلاحظ ان اللهجات المغاربيه تبرز بين الحين والاخر في اللكنه البيروتيه لا سيما اللهجه التونسيه، ولهجه الشلوح سكان بلاد السوس وجبال الاطلس في المغرب الاقصى، ولهجه تمازرت وهي لهجه سكان الاطلس المتوسط، واللهجه الزناتيه لهجه سكان الريف في الشمال، فضلاً عن لهجات الجزائر وليبيا. علمًا ان الكثير من ملامح اللكنه البيروتيه بدات تزول بسبب «التفرنج» في الكلام، ومع اقتحام العادات والتقاليد الغربيه المنازل والشوارع والاسواق والمدارس والجامعات، واجهزه الاعلام المتنوعه. ومن سمات لهجه العائلات البيروتيه على سبيل المثال: تحويل السين صادًا، مثل: البسطه == البصطه، وتحويل الجيم الى شين، مثال ذلك: الحرج = الحرش، اجتماع == اشتماع. فضلاً على ان اللهجه الخليجيه التي انتقلت مع الفتوحات الاسلاميه الى المغرب العربي ثم ارتدت مجددًا الى المشرق تظهر واضحه في اسماء بعض العائلات، مثل: بعيون؛ اي: ابو العيون، من با

          "content": "Baalbek (; Arabic: بَعْلَبَكّ, romanized: Baʿlabakk; Syriac: ܒܥܠܒܟ) is a city located east of the Litani River in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, about 67 km (42 mi) northeast of Beirut. It is the capital of Baalbek-Hermel Governorate. In 1998, the city had a population of 82,608. Most of the population consists of Shia Muslims, followed by Sunni Muslims and Christians; in 2017, there was also a large presence of Syrian refugees.\nBaalbek's history dates back at least 11,000 years. After Alexander the Great conquered the city in 334 BCE, he renamed it Heliopolis (Ἡλιούπολις, Greek for \"Sun City\"). The city flourished under Roman rule. However, it underwent transformations during the Christianization period and the subsequent rise of Islam following the Arab conquest in the 7th century. In later periods, the city was sacked by the Mongols and faced a series of earthquakes, resulting in a decline in importance during the Ottoman and modern periods.\nIn the modern era, Baalbek is a tourist destination. It is known for the ruins of the Roman temple complex, which includes the Temple of Bacchus and the Temple of Jupiter, and was inscribed in 1984 as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Other tourist attractions are the Great Umayyad Mosque, the Baalbek International Festival, the mausoleum of Sit Khawla, and a Roman quarry site named Hajar al-Hibla. Baalbek's tourism sector has encountered challenges due to conflicts in Lebanon, particularly the 1975–1990 civil war, the ongoing Syrian civil war since 2011, and the Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present).\nBaalbek is considered to be part of Hezbollah's heartland and is known to be their political stronghold. During the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon (1982–2000), the group managed to overpower the Lebanese army in Baalbek and gain control of the city. The settlement was subsequently used as a base to recruit and train men for attacks against Israeli forces. Hezbollah continues to hold significant political influence and popular support in Baalbek. In the 2022 Lebanese general election the Amal-Hezbollah list won 9 out of 10 seats in the Baalbek-Hermel Governorate.\nIsrael has conducted numerous airstrikes and raids against military and civilian targets in the Baalbek area in the past decades. For instance, in 2006 during the Operation Sharp and Smooth, Israeli commandos raided a hospital and bombed multiple houses, killing two Hezbollah fighters and at least eleven civilians. In 2024, during the Israel–Hezbollah conflict, Israel sent forced displacement calls for the entire city. Shortly after, Israeli airstrikes killed 19 people, including 8 women.\n\nEtymology\nA few kilometres from the swamp from which the Litani (the classical Leontes) and the Asi (the upper Orontes) flow, Baalbek may be the same as the manbaa al-nahrayn (\"Source of the Two Rivers\"), the abode of El in the Ugaritic Baal Cycle discovered in the 1920s and a separate serpent incantation.\nBaalbek was called Heliopolis during the Roman Empire, a latinisation of the Greek Hēlioúpolis (Ἡλιούπολις) used during the Hellenistic period, meaning \"Sun City\" in reference to the solar cult there. The name is attested under the Seleucids and Ptolemies. However, Ammianus Marcellinus notes that earlier Assyrian names of Levantine towns continued to be used alongside the official Greek ones imposed by the Diadochi, who were successors of Alexander the Great. In Greek religion, Helios was both the sun in the sky and its personification as a god. The local Semitic god Baʿal Haddu was more often equated with Zeus or Jupiter or simply called the \"Great God of Heliopolis\", but the name may refer to the Egyptians' association of Baʿal with their great god Ra. It was sometimes described as Heliopolis in Syria or Coelesyria (Latin: Heliopolis Syriaca or Syriae) to distinguish it from its namesake in Egypt. In Catholicism, its titular see is distinguished as Heliopolis in Phoenicia, from its former Roman province Phoenice. The importance of the solar cult is also attested in the name Biḳāʿ al-ʿAzīz borne by the plateau surrounding Baalbek, as it references an earlier solar deity named Aziz. In Greek and Roman antiquity, it was known as Heliopolis. Some of the best-preserved Roman ruins in Lebanon are located here, including one of the largest temples of the Roman empire. The gods worshipped there (Jupiter, Venus, and Bacchus) were equivalents of the Canaanite deities Hadad, Atargatis. Local influences are seen in the planning and layout of the temples, which differ from classic Roman design.\n\nThe name BʿLBK appears in the Mishnah, a second-century rabbinic text, as a kind of garlic, shum ba'albeki (שום בעלבכי). It appears in two early 5th-century Syriac manuscripts, a c. 411 translation of Eusebius's Theophania and a c. 435 life of Rabbula, bishop of Edessa. It was pronounced as Baʿlabakk (Arabic: بَعْلَبَكّ) in Classical Arabic. In Modern Standard Arabic, its vowels are marked as Baʿlabak (بَعْلَبَك) or Baʿlabekk. It is Bʿalbik (بْعَلْبِك, is [ˈbʕalbik]) in Lebanese Arabic.\nThe etymology of Baalbek has been debated since the 18th century. Cook took it to mean \"Baʿal (Lord) of the Beka\" and Donne as \"City of the Sun\". Lendering asserts that it is probably a contraction of Baʿal Nebeq (\"Lord of the Source\" of the Litani River). Steiner proposes a Semitic adaption of \"Lord Bacchus\", from the classical temple complex.\nNineteenth-century Biblical archaeologists proposed the association of Baalbek with the town of Baalgad in the Book of Joshua; the town of Baalath, one of Solomon's cities in the First Book of Kings; Baal-hamon, where Solomon had a vineyard; and the \"Plain of Aven\" in Book of Amos.\n\nHistory\nPrehistory\nThe hilltop of Tell Baalbek, part of a valley to the east of the northern Beqaa Valley (Latin: Coele-Syria), shows signs of almost continual habitation over the last 8–9000 years. It was well-watered both from a stream running from the Rās al-ʿAyn spring southwest of the citadel and, during the spring, from numerous rills formed by meltwater from the Anti-Lebanons. Macrobius later credited the site's foundation to a colony of Egyptian or Assyrian priests. The settlement's religious, commercial, and strategic importance was minor enough, however, that it is never mentioned in any known Assyrian or Egyptian record, unless under another name. Its enviable position in a fertile valley, major watershed, and along the route from Tyre to Palmyra should have made it a wealthy and splendid site from an early age. During the Canaanite period, the local temples were primarily devoted to the Heliopolitan Triad: a male god (Baʿal), his consort (Astarte), and their son (Adon). The site of the present Temple of Jupiter was probably the focus of earlier worship, as its altar was located at the hill's precise summit and the rest of the sanctuary raised to its level.\nIn Islamic mythology, the temple complex was said to have been a palace of Solomon's which was put together by djinn and given as a wedding gift to the Queen of Sheba; its actual Roman origin remained obscured by the citadel's medieval fortifications as late as the 16th-century visit of the Polish prince Radziwiłł.\n\nAntiquity\nAfter Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia in the 330s BC, Baalbek (under its Hellenic name Heliopolis) formed part of the Diadochi kingdoms of Egypt & Syria. It was annexed by the Romans during their eastern wars. The settlers of the Roman colony Colonia Julia Augusta Felix Heliopolitana may have arrived as early as the time of Caesar but were more probably the veterans of the 5th and 8th Legions under Augustus, during which time it hosted a Roman garrison. From 15 BC to AD 193, it formed part of the territory of Berytus. It is mentioned in Josephus, Pliny, Strabo, and Ptolemy and on coins of nearly every emperor from Nerva to Gallienus. The 1st-century Pliny did not number it among the Decapolis, the \"Ten Cities\" of Coelesyria, while the 2nd-century Ptolemy did. The population likely varied seasonally with market fairs and the schedules of the Indian monsoon and caravans to the coast and interior.\n\nDuring Classical Antiquity, the city's temple to Baʿal Haddu was conflated first with the worship of the Greek sun god Helios and then with the Greek and Roman sky god under the name \"Heliopolitan Zeus\" or \"Jupiter\". The present Temple of Jupiter presumably replaced an earlier one using the same foundation; it was constructed during the mid-1st century and probably completed around AD 60. His idol was a beardless golden god in the pose of a charioteer, with a whip raised in his right hand and a thunderbolt and stalks of grain in his left; its image appeared on local coinage and it was borne through the streets during several festivals throughout the year. Macrobius compared the rituals to those for Diva Fortuna at Antium and says the bearers were the principal citizens of the town, who prepared for their role with abstinence, chastity, and shaved heads. In bronze statuary attested from Byblos in Phoenicia and Tortosa in Spain, he was encased in a pillarlike term and surrounded (like the Greco-Persian Mithras) by busts representing the sun, moon, and five known planets. In these statues, the bust of Mercury is made particularly prominent; a marble stela at Massilia in Transalpine Gaul shows a similar arrangement but enlarges Mercury into a full figure. Local cults also revered the Baetylia, black conical stones considered sacred to Baʿal. One of these was taken to Rome by the emperor Elagabalus, a former priest \"of the sun\" at nearby Emesa, who erected a temple for it on the Palatine Hill. Heliopolis was a noted oracle and pilgrimage site, whence the cult spread far afield, with inscriptions to the Heliopolitan god discovered in Athens, Rome, Pannonia, Venetia, Gaul, and near the Wall in Britain. The Roman temple complex grew up from the early part of the reign of Augustus in the late 1st century BC until the rise of Christianity in the 4th century. (The 6th-century chronicles of John Malalas of Antioch, which claimed Baalbek as a \"wonder of the world\", credited most of the complex to the 2nd-century Antoninus Pius, but it is uncertain how reliable his account is on the point.) By that time, the complex housed three temples on Tell Baalbek: one to Jupiter Heliopolitanus (Baʿal), one to Venus Heliopolitana (Ashtart), and a third to Bacchus. On a nearby hill, a fourth temple was dedicated to the third figure of the Heliopolitan Triad, Mercury (Adon or Seimios). Ultimately, the site vied with Praeneste in Italy as the two largest sanctuaries in the Western world.\nThe emperor Trajan consulted the site's oracle twice. The first time, he requested a written reply to his sealed and unopened question; he was favorably impressed by the god's blank reply as his own paper had been empty. He then inquired whether he would return alive from his wars against Parthia and received in reply a centurion's vine staff, broken to pieces. In AD 193, Septimius Severus granted the city ius Italicum rights. His wife Julia Domna and son Caracalla toured Egypt and Syria in AD 215; inscriptions in their honour at the site may date from that occasion; Julia was a Syrian native whose father had been an Emesan priest \"of the sun\" like Elagabalus.\nThe town became a battleground upon the rise of Christianity. Early Christian writers such as Eusebius (from nearby Caesarea) repeatedly execrated the practices of the local pagans in their worship of the Heliopolitan Venus. In AD 297, the actor Gelasinus converted in the middle of a scene mocking baptism; his public profession of faith provoked the audience to drag him from the theater and stone him to death. In the early 4th century, the deacon Cyril defaced many of the idols in Heliopolis; he was killed and (allegedly) cannibalised. Around the same time, Constantine, though not yet a Christian, demolished the goddess' temple, raised a basilica in its place, and outlawed the locals' ancient custom of prostituting women before marriage. Bar Hebraeus also credited him with ending the locals' continued practice of polygamy. The enraged locals responded by raping and torturing Christian virgins. They reacted violently again under the freedom permitted to them by Julian the Apostate. The city was so noted for its hostility to the Christians that Alexandrians were banished to it as a special punishment. The Temple of Jupiter, already greatly damaged by earthquakes, was demolished under Theodosius in 379 and replaced by another basilica (now lost), using stones scavenged from the pagan complex. The Easter Chronicle states he was also responsible for destroying all the lesser temples and shrines of the city. Around the year 400, Rabbula, the future bishop of Edessa, attempted to have himself martyred by disrupting the pagans of Baalbek but was only thrown down the temple stairs along with his companion. It became the seat of its own bishop as well. Under the reign of Justinian, eight of the complex's Corinthian columns were disassembled and shipped to Constantinople for incorporation in the rebuilt Hagia Sophia sometime between 532 and 537. Michael the Syrian claimed the golden idol of Heliopolitan Jupiter was still to be seen during the reign of Justin II (560s & 570s), and, up to the time of its conquest by the Muslims, it was renowned for its palaces, monuments, and gardens.\n\nMiddle Ages and early modernity\nBaalbek was occupied by the Muslim army in AD 634 (AH 13), in 636, or under Abu ʿUbaidah following the Byzantine defeat at Yarmouk in 637 (AH 16), either peacefully and by agreement or following a heroic defense and yielding 2,000 oz (57 kg) of gold, 4,000 oz (110 kg) of silver, 2000 silk vests, and 1000 swords. The ruined temple complex was fortified under the name al-Qala' (lit. \"The Fortress\") but was sacked with great violence by the Damascene caliph Marwan II in 748, at which time it was dismantled and largely depopulated. It formed part of the district of Damascus under the Umayyads and Abbasids before being conquered by Fatimid Egypt in 942. In the mid-10th century, it was said to have \"gates of palaces sculptured in marble and lofty columns also of marble\" and that it was the most \"stupendous\" and \"considerable\" location in the whole of Syria. It was sacked and razed by the Byzantines under John I in 974, raided by Basil II in 1000, and occupied by Salih ibn Mirdas, emir of Aleppo, in 1025.\nIn 1075, it was finally lost to the Fatimids on its conquest by Tutush I, Seljuk emir of Damascus. It was briefly held by Muslim ibn Quraysh, emir of Aleppo, in 1083; after its recovery, it was ruled in the Seljuks' name by the eunuch Gümüshtegin until he was deposed for conspiring against the usurper Toghtekin in 1110. Toghtekin then gave the town to his son Buri. Upon Buri's succession to Damascus on his father's death in 1128, he granted the area to his son Muhammad. After Buri's murder, Muhammad successfully defended himself against the attacks of his brothers Ismaʿil and Mahmud and gave Baalbek to his vizier Unur. In July 1139, Zengi, atabeg of Aleppo and stepfather of Mahmud, besieged Baalbek with 14 catapults. The outer city held until 10 October and the citadel until the 21st, when Unur surrendered upon a promise of safe passage. In December, Zengi negotiated with Muhammad, offering to trade Baalbek or Homs for Damascus, but Unur convinced the atabeg to refuse. Zengi strengthened its fortifications and bestowed the territory on his lieutenant Ayyub, father of Saladin. Upon Zengi's assassination in 1146, Ayyub surrendered the territory to Unur, who was acting as regent for Muhammad's son Abaq. It was granted to the eunuch Ata al-Khadim, who also served as viceroy of Damascus.\nIn December 1151, it was raided by the garrison of Banyas as a reprisal for its role in a Turcoman raid on Banyas. Following Ata's murder, his nephew Dahhak, emir of the Wadi al-Taym, ruled Baalbek. He was forced to relinquish it to Nur ad-Din in 1154 after Ayyub had successfully intrigued against Abaq from his estates near Baalbek. Ayyub then administered the area from Damascus on Nur ad-Din's behalf. In the mid-12th century, Idrisi mentioned Baalbek's two temples and the legend of their origin under Solomon; it was visited by the Jewish traveler Benjamin of Tudela in 1170.\nBaalbek's citadel served as a jail for Crusaders taken by the Zengids as prisoners of war. In 1171, these captives successfully overpowered their guards and took possession of the castle from its garrison. Muslims from the surrounding area gathered, however, and entered the castle through a secret passageway shown to them by a local. The Crusaders were then massacred.\nThree major earthquakes occurred in the 12th century, in 1139, 1157, and 1170. The one in 1170 ruined Baalbek's walls and, though Nur ad-Din repaired them, his young heir Ismaʿil was made to yield it to Saladin by a 4-month siege in 1174. Having taken control of Damascus on the invitation of its governor Ibn al-Muqaddam, Saladin rewarded him with the emirate of Baalbek following the Ayyubid victory at the Horns of Hama in 1175. Baldwin, the young leper king of Jerusalem, came of age the next year, ending the Crusaders' treaty with Saladin. His former regent, Raymond of Tripoli, raided the Beqaa Valley from the west in the summer, suffering a slight defeat at Ibn al-Muqaddam's hands. He was then joined by the main army, riding north under Baldwin and Humphrey of Toron; they defeated Saladin's elder brother Turan Shah in August at Ayn al-Jarr and plundered Baalbek. Upon the deposition of Turan Shah for neglecting his duties in Damascus, however, he demanded his childhood home of Baalbek as compensation. Ibn al-Muqaddam did not consent and Saladin opted to invest the city in late 1178 to maintain peace within his own family. An attempt to pledge fealty to the Christians at Jerusalem was ignored on behalf of an existing treaty with Saladin. The siege was maintained peacefully through the snows of winter, with Saladin waiting for the \"foolish\" commander and his garrison of \"ignorant scum\" to come to terms. Sometime in spring, Ibn al-Muqaddam yielded and Saladin accepted his terms, granting him Baʿrin, Kafr Tab, and al-Maʿarra. The generosity quieted unrest among Saladin's vassals through the rest of his reign but led his enemies to attempt to take advantage of his presumed weakness. He did not permit Turan Shah to retain Baalbek very long, though, instructing him to lead the Egyptian troops returning home in 1179 and appointing him to a sinecure in Alexandria. Baalbek was then granted to his nephew Farrukh Shah, whose family ruled it for the next half-century. When Farrukh Shah died three years later, his son Bahram Shah was only a child but he was permitted his inheritance and ruled til 1230. He was followed by al-Ashraf Musa, who was succeeded by his brother as-Salih Ismail, who received it in 1237 as compensation for being deprived of Damascus by their brother al-Kamil. It was seized in 1246 after a year of assaults by as-Salih Ayyub, who bestowed it upon Saʿd al-Din al-Humaidi. When as-Salih Ayyub's successor Turan Shah was murdered in 1250, al-Nasir Yusuf, the sultan of Aleppo, seized Damascus and demanded Baalbek's surrender. Instead, its emir did homage and agreed to regular payments of tribute.\nThe Mongolian general Kitbuqa took Baalbek in 1260 and dismantled its fortifications. Later in the same year, however, Qutuz, the sultan of Egypt, defeated the Mongols and placed Baalbek under the rule of their emir in Damascus. Most of the city's still-extant fine mosque and fortress architecture dates to the reign of the sultan Qalawun in the 1280s. By the early 14th century, Abulfeda the Hamathite was describing the city's \"large and strong fortress\". The revived settlement was again destroyed by a flood on 10 May 1318, when water from the east and northeast made holes 30 m (98 ft) wide in walls 4 m (13 ft) thick. 194 people were killed and 1500 houses, 131 shops, 44 orchards, 17 ovens, 11 mills, and 4 aqueducts were ruined, along with the town's mosque and 13 other religious and educational buildings. In 1400, Timur pillaged the town, and there was further destruction from a 1459 earthquake.\n\nEarly modernity\nIn 1516, Baalbek was conquered with the rest of Syria by the Ottoman sultan Selim the Grim. In recognition of their prominence among the Shiites of the Beqaa Valley, the Ottomans awarded the sanjak of Homs and local iltizam concessions to Baalbek's Harfush family. Like the Hamadas, the Harfush emirs were involved on more than one occasion in the selection of Church officials and the running of local monasteries. Tradition holds that many Christians quit the Baalbek region in the eighteenth century for the newer, more secure town of Zahlé on account of the Harfushes' oppression and rapacity, but more critical studies have questioned this interpretation, pointing out that the Harfushes were closely allied to the Orthodox Ma'luf family of Zahlé (where indeed Mustafa Harfush took refuge some years later) and showing that depredations from various quarters as well as Zahlé's growing commercial attractiveness accounted for Baalbek's decline in the eighteenth century. What repression there was did not always target the Christian community per se. The Shiite 'Usayran family, for example, is also said to have left Baalbek in this period to avoid expropriation by the Harfushes, establishing itself as one of the premier commercial households of Sidon and later even serving as consuls of Iran.\nFrom the 16th century, European tourists began to visit the colossal and picturesque ruins. Donne hyperbolised \"No ruins of antiquity have attracted more attention than those of Heliopolis, or been more frequently or accurately measured and described.\" Misunderstanding the temple of Bacchus as the \"Temple of the Sun\", they considered it the best-preserved Roman temple in the world. The Englishman Robert Wood's 1757 Ruins of Balbec included carefully measured engravings that proved influential on British and Continental Neoclassical architects. For example, details of the Temple of Bacchus's ceiling inspired a bed and ceiling by Robert Adam and its portico inspired that of St George's in Bloomsbury.\nDuring the 18th century, the western approaches were covered with attractive groves of walnut trees, but the town itself suffered badly during the 1759 earthquakes, after which it was held by the Metawali, who again feuded with other Lebanese tribes. Their power was broken by Jezzar Pasha, the rebel governor of Acre, in the last half of the 18th century. All the same, Baalbek remained no destination for a traveller unaccompanied by an armed guard. Upon the pasha's death in 1804, chaos ensued until Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt occupied the area in 1831, after which it again passed into the hands of the Harfushes. In 1835, the town's population was barely 200 people. In 1850, the Ottomans finally began direct administration of the area, making Baalbek a kaza under the Damascus Eyalet and its governor a kaymakam.\n\nExcavations\nEmperor Wilhelm II of Germany and his wife passed through Baalbek on 1 November 1898, on their way to Jerusalem. He noted both the magnificence of the Roman remains and the drab condition of the modern settlement. It was expected at the time that natural disasters, winter frosts, and the raiding of building materials by the city's residents would shortly ruin the remaining ruins. The archaeological team he dispatched began work within a month. Despite finding nothing they could date prior to Baalbek's Roman occupation, Otto Puchstein and his associates worked until 1904 and produced a meticulously researched and thoroughly illustrated series of volumes. Later excavations under the Roman flagstones in the Great Court unearthed three skeletons and a fragment of Persian pottery dated to the 6th–4th centuries BC. The sherd featured cuneiform letters.\nIn 1977, Jean-Pierre Adam made a brief study suggesting most of the large blocks could have been moved on rollers with machines using capstans and pulley blocks, a process which he theorised could use 512 workers to move a 557 tonnes (614 tons) block. \"Baalbek, with its colossal structures, is one of the finest examples of Imperial Roman architecture at its apogee\", UNESCO reported in making Baalbek a World Heritage Site in 1984. When the committee inscribed the site, it expressed the wish that the protected area include the entire town within the Arab walls, as well as the southwestern extramural quarter between Bastan-al-Khan, the Roman site and the Mameluk mosque of Ras-al-Ain. Lebanon's representative gave assurances that the committee's wish would be honoured. Recent cleaning operations at the Temple of Jupiter discovered the deep trench at its edge, whose study pushed back the date of Tell Baalbek's settlement to the PPNB Neolithic. Finds included pottery sherds including a spout dating to the early Bronze Age. In the summer of 2014, a team from the German Archaeological Institute led by Jeanine Abdul Massih of the Lebanese University discovered a sixth, much larger stone suggested to be the world's largest ancient block. The stone was found underneath and next to the Stone of the Pregnant Woman (\"Hajjar al-Hibla\") and measures around 19.6 m × 6 m × 5.5 m (64 ft × 20 ft × 18 ft). It is estimated to weigh 1,650 tonnes (1,820 tons).\n\nModern history\nBaalbek was connected to the DHP, the French-owned railway concession in Ottoman Syria, on 19 June 1902. It formed a station on the standard-gauge line between Riyaq to its south and Aleppo (now in Syria) to its north. This Aleppo Railway connected to the Beirut–Damascus Railway but—because that line was built to a 1.05-meter gauge—all traffic had to be unloaded and reloaded at Riyaq. Just before the First World War, the population was still around 5000, about 2000 each of Sunnis and Shia Mutawalis and 1000 Orthodox and Maronites. The French general Georges Catroux proclaimed the independence of Lebanon in 1941 but colonial rule continued until 1943. Baalbek still has its railway station but service has been discontinued since the 1970s, originally owing to the Lebanese Civil War.\nIn March 1974, Musa al-Sadr announced the launching of the \"Movement of the Deprived\" in front of a rally in Baalbek attended by 75,000 men. Its objective was to stand up for Lebanon's neglected Shia community. In his speech he listed grievances with the Lebanese government, including Baalbek's lack of a secondary school, Shia communities receiving disproportionately less funds from the national budget, most of the homeless being Shia etc. The occasion was a religious one, and there was celebratory gunfire preceding it. He also announced the setting up of military training camps to train villagers in southern Lebanon to protect their homes from Israeli attacks. These camps led to the creation of the Amal Militia.\nBy the 2000s, Baalbek was frequently described as a stronghold of Hezbollah, although it also has a large presence of Christians and Sunni Muslims. Many of the city's mayors have been Shia, but since 2022, Baalbek has had a Sunni mayor.\n\nIsraeli–Lebanon conflict\nIn 1978, Israel invaded south Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands of Shia Muslims to flee. As a result of the invasion, when Hassan Nasrallah returned to Lebanon from his studies in Najaf, he was unable to return to his hometown in the south, and instead settled in Baalbek. Abbas al-Musawi also moved to Baalbek.\nIn 1982, at the height of another Israeli invasion, Amal split into two factions over Nabih Berri's acceptance of the American plan to evacuate Palestinians from West Beirut. A large number of dissidents, led by Amal's military commander Hussein Musawi moved to Baalbek. Once established in the town the group, which was to evolve into Hezbollah, began to work with Iranian Revolutionary Guards, veterans of the Iran Iraq War. The following year the Iranians established their headquarters in the Sheikh Abdullah barracks in Baalbek. Ultimately there were between 1,500 and 2,000 Revolutionary Guards in Lebanon, with outposts further south in the Shia villages, such as Jebchit.\nIn 1984, Israel launched raids on Baalbek, killing 100 Lebanese civilians and wounding hundreds inside the city. Israel also bombed a school in the Wavel Palestinian refugee camp next to the city, wounding 150 school children.\nOn 24/25 June 1999, following elections in Israel and the new administration undecided, the IAF launched two massive air raids across Lebanon. One of the targets was the al Manar radio station's offices in a four-storey building in Baalbek which was completely demolished. The attacks also hit Beirut's power stations and bridges on the roads to the south. An estimated $52 million damage was caused. Eleven Lebanese were killed as well as two Israelis in Kiryat Shmona.\n\n2006 Lebanon War\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon war, many Israeli bombs fell inside the historic Roman town, and some fell as close as 300 meters from the temple of Baalbek. After the war, UNESCO stated that the cracks in the Roman temples had widened. The damage was thought to be due to shockwaves created by the bombs.\nMore than 250 houses and buildings were destroyed by Israel during the war. Reporters investigating the aftermath found these to be civilian houses and didn't find any evidence of military use.\nOn the evening of 1 August 2006, hundreds of Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers raided Baalbek and the Dar al-Hikma or Hikmeh Hospital in Jamaliyeh to its north (\"Operation Sharp and Smooth\"). Their mission was to rescue two captured soldiers, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, who were abducted by Hezbollah on 12 July 2006. They were transported by helicopter and supported by Apache helicopters and unmanned drones, The IDF was acting on information that Goldwasser and Regev were at the hospital. al-Jazeera and other sources claimed the IDF was attempting to capture senior Hezbollah officials, particularly Sheikh Mohammad Yazbek. The hospital had been empty for four days, the most unwell patients having been transferred and the rest sent home. \nOn August 7, Israel killed 9 civilians in an attack on Brital, just south of Baalbek, and by the subsequent attack on the car leaving the scene for the hospital. A Human Rights Watch investigation showed that none of those killed were combatants, it is likely none were members of Hezbollah, and none of the survivors had any knowledge of any military presence at place of the attack.\nOn 14 August just before the ceasefire took effect, two Lebanese police and five Lebanese soldiers were killed by a drone strike while driving their van around the still-damaged road through Jamaliyeh.\n\nGeography\nClimate\nBaalbek has a mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa) with significant continental influences. It is located in one of the drier regions of the country, giving it an annual average of 450 millimetres or 18 inches of rainfall compared with 800 to 850 millimetres (31 to 33 in) in coastal areas, overwhelmingly concentrated in the months from November to April. Baalbek has hot rainless summers with cool (and occasionally snowy) winters. Autumn and spring are mild and fairly rainy.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Muslims made up 93.85% and Christians made up 5.66% of registered voters in Baalbek. 59.61% of the voters were Shiite Muslims and 34.24% were Sunni Muslims.\n\nEconomy\nTourism\nThe Roman ruins have been the setting for the long running Baalbek International Festival.\nBaalbek's tourism sector suffered significantly due to the Lebanese Civil war (1975–1990). After the civil war ended, tourism gradually saw a resurgence, including opera, orchestras. But it was once again disrupted by Israeli bombings of Baalbek during the 2006 war.\nAfter the 2006 war, conservation work at Lebanon's historic sites began in October that year. The ruins at Baalbek were not directly hit by Israeli bombing but the effects of blasts during the conflict toppled a block of stones at the Roman ruins and existing cracks in the temples of Jupiter and Bacchus were feared to have widened. Frederique Husseini, director-general of Lebanon's Department of Antiquities, requested $550,000 from Europeans to restore Baalbek's souk and another $900,000 for repairs to other damaged structures.\nStarting in the early 2000s, Hezbollah organized permanent or temporary exhibitions called \"Exposition of the Resistance\" which commemorate what is considered to be Lebanese resistance to Israeli occupation. Spanning several hundred square meters, the exhibitions feature defused Israeli weapons, recreated scenes of war, and photos and videos of Lebanese people killed by Israel. Starting in 2009, Hezbollah setup an exhibition to commemorate the 2006 war.\nDuring the Syrian civil war, the UK FCO designated areas close to the Syrian border, including Baalbek and the rest of Beqaa valley, as \"red zone\" – advising against all travel. The US State Department made a similar designation. These designations, prompted by perceived proximity to Syria and clashes between Sunnis and Alawites, discouraged international tourism.\nDuring its 2024 invasion of Lebanon, Israel bombed a restaurant frequented by tourists and damaged the historic Hotel Palmyra. In November, UNESCO gave Baalbek enhanced protection to safeguard against damage to the archaeological site during the invasion; it was one of 34 areas to receive this protection.\n\nRuins\nThe Tell Baalbek temple complex, fortified as the town's citadel during the Middle Ages, was constructed from local stone, mostly white granite and a rough white marble. Over the years, it has suffered from the region's numerous earthquakes, the iconoclasm of Christian and Muslim lords, and the reuse of the temples' stone for fortification and other construction. The temples also suffered minor damage from the shockwaves generated by nearby Israeli bombings in the 2006 Lebanon war. The nearby Qubbat Duris, a 13th-century Muslim shrine on the old road to Damascus, is built out of granite columns, apparently removed from Baalbek. Further, the jointed columns were once banded together with iron; many were gouged open or toppled by the emirs of Damascus to get at the metal. As late as the 16th century, the Temple of Jupiter still held 27 standing columns out of an original 58; there were only nine before the 1759 earthquakes and six today.\nThe complex is located on a raised plaza erected 5 m (16 ft) over an earlier T-shaped base consisting of a podium, staircase, and foundation walls. These walls were built from about 24 monoliths, at their lowest level weighing approximately 300 tonnes (330 tons) each. The tallest retaining wall, on the west, has a second course of monoliths containing the famous \"Three Stones\" (Ancient Greek: Τρίλιθον, Trílithon): a row of three stones, each over 19 m (62 ft) long, 4.3 m (14 ft) high, and 3.6 m (12 ft) broad, cut from limestone. They weigh approximately 800 tonnes (880 tons) each. A fourth, still larger stone is called the Stone of the Pregnant Woman: it lies unused in a nearby quarry 800 m (2,600 ft) from the town. Its weight is estimated at 1,000 tonnes (1,100 tons). A fifth, still larger stone weighing approximately 1,200 tonnes (1,300 tons) lies in the same quarry.  This quarry was slightly higher than the temple complex, so no lifting was required to move the stones.\nThe temple complex was entered from the east through the Propylaea (προπύλαιον, propýlaion) or Portico, consisting of a broad staircase rising 20 feet (6.1 m) to an arcade of 12 columns flanked by 2 towers. Most of the columns have been toppled and the stairs were entirely dismantled for use in the nearby later wall, but a Latin inscription remains on several of their bases stating that Longinus, a lifeguard of the 1st Parthian Legion, and Septimius, a freedman, gilded their capitals with bronze in gratitude for the safety of Septimius Severus's son Antoninus Caracalla and empress Julia Domna.\nImmediately behind the Propylaeum is a hexagonal forecourt reached through a threefold entrance that was added in the mid-3rd century by the emperor Philip the Arab. Traces remain of the two series of columns which once encircled it, but its original function remains uncertain. Donne reckoned it as the town's forum. Badly preserved coins of the era led some to believe this was a sacred cypress grove, but better specimens show that the coins displayed a single stalk of grain instead.\nThe rectangular Great Court to its west covers around 3 or 4 acres (1.2 or 1.6 ha) and included the main altar for burnt offering, with mosaic-floored lustration basins to its north and south, a subterranean chamber, and three underground passageways 17 ft (5.2 m) wide by 30 ft (9.1 m) high, two of which run east and west and the third connecting them north and south, all bearing inscriptions suggesting their occupation by Roman soldiers. These were surrounded by Corinthian porticoes, one of which was never completed. The columns' bases and capitals were of limestone; the shafts were monoliths of highly polished red Egyptian granite 7.08 m (23.2 ft) high. Six remain standing, out of an original 128. Inscriptions attest that the court was once adorned by portraits of Marcus Aurelius's daughter Sabina, Septimius Severus, Gordian, and Velius Rufus, dedicated by the city's Roman colonists. The entablature was richly decorated but is now mostly ruined. A westward-facing basilica was constructed over the altar during the reign of Theodosius; it was later altered to make it eastward-facing like most Christian churches.\n\nThe Temple of Jupiter—once wrongly credited to Helios—lay at the western end of the Great Court, raised another 7 m (23 ft) on a 47.7 m × 87.75 m (156.5 ft × 287.9 ft) platform reached by a wide staircase. Under the Byzantines, it was also known as the \"Trilithon\" from the three massive stones in its foundation and, when taken together with the forecourt and Great Court, it is also known as the Great Temple. The Temple of Jupiter proper was circled by a peristyle of 54 unfluted Corinthian columns: 10 in front and back and 19 along each side. The temple was ruined by earthquakes, destroyed and pillaged for stone under Theodosius, and 8 columns were taken to Constantinople (Istanbul) under Justinian for incorporation into the Hagia Sophia. Three fell during the late 18th century. 6 columns, however, remain standing along its south side with their entablature. Their capitals remain nearly perfect on the south side, while the Beqaa's winter winds have worn the northern faces almost bare. The architrave and frieze blocks weigh up to 60 tonnes (66 tons) each, and one corner block over 100 tonnes (110 tons), all of them raised to a height of 19 m (62.34 ft) above the ground. Individual Roman cranes were not capable of lifting stones this heavy. They may have simply been rolled into position along temporary earthen banks from the quarry. The Julio-Claudian emperors enriched its sanctuary in turn. In the mid-1st century, Nero built the tower-altar opposite the temple. In the early 2nd century, Trajan added the temple's forecourt, with porticos of pink granite shipped from Aswan at the southern end of Egypt.\nThe Temple of Bacchus—once wrongly credited to Jupiter—may have been completed under Septimius Severus in the 190s, as his coins are the first to show it beside the Temple of Jupiter. It is the best preserved of the sanctuary's structures, as the other rubble from its ruins protected it. It is enriched by some of the most refined reliefs and sculpture to survive from antiquity. The temple is surrounded by forty-two columns—8 along each end and 15 along each side—nearly 20 m (66 ft) in height. These were probably erected in a rough state and then rounded, polished, and decorated in position. The entrance was preserved as late as Pococke and Wood, but the keystone of the lintel had slid 2 ft (1 m) following the 1759 earthquakes; a column of rough masonry was erected in the 1860s or '70s to support it. The 1759 earthquakes also damaged the area around the soffit's famed inscription of an eagle, which was entirely covered by the keystone's supporting column. The area around the inscription of the eagle was greatly damaged by the 1759 earthquake. The interior of the temple is divided into a 98 ft (30 m) nave and a 36 ft (11 m) adytum or sanctuary on a platform raised 5 ft (2 m) above it and fronted by 13 steps. The screen between the two sections once held reliefs of Neptune, Triton, Arion and his dolphin, and other marine figures but these have been lost. The temple was used as a kind of donjon for the medieval Arab and Turkish fortifications, although its eastern steps were lost sometime after 1688. Much of the portico was incorporated into a huge wall directly before its gate, but this was demolished in July 1870 by Barker on orders from Syria's governor Rashid Pasha. Two spiral staircases in columns on either side of the entrance lead to the roof.\n\nThe Temple of Venus—also known as the Circular Temple or Nymphaeum—was added under Septimius Severus in the early 3rd century but destroyed under Constantine, who raised a basilica in its place. Jessup considered it the \"gem of Baalbek\". It lies about 150 yd (140 m) from the southeast corner of the Temple of Bacchus. It was known in the 19th century as El Barbara or Barbarat el-Atikah (St Barbara's), having been used as a Greek Orthodox church into the 18th century.\nThe ancient walls of Heliopolis had a circumference of a little less than 4 mi (6 km). Much of the extant fortifications around the complex date to the 13th century reconstruction undertaken by the Mamluk sultan Qalawun following the devastation of the earlier defenses by the Mongol army under Kitbuqa. This includes the great southeast tower. The earliest round of fortifications were two walls to the southwest of the Temples of Jupiter and Bacchus. The original southern gateway with two small towers was filled in and replaced by a new large tower flanked by curtains, probably under Buri or Zengi. Bahramshah replaced that era's southwest tower with one of his own in 1213 and built another in the northwest in 1224; the west tower was probably strengthened around the same time. An inscription dates the barbican-like strengthening of the southern entrance to around 1240. Qalawun relocated the two western curtains nearer to the western tower, which was rebuilt with great blocks of stone. The barbican was repaired and more turns added to its approach. From around 1300, no alterations were made to the fortifications apart from repairs such as Sultan Barkuk's restoration of the moat in preparation for Timur's arrival.\nMaterial from the ruins is incorporated into a ruined mosque north of downtown and probably also in the Qubbat Duris on the road to Damascus. In the 19th century, a \"shell-topped canopy\" from the ruins was used nearby as a mihrab, propped up to show locals the direction of Mecca for their daily prayers.\nUnder a white dome further towards town is the tomb of Khawla, daughter of Hussein and granddaughter of Ali, who died in Baalbek while Husayn's family was being transported as prisoners to Damascus.\n\nEcclesiastical history\nHeliopolis (in Phoenicia; not to be confused with the Egyptian bishopric Heliopolis in Augustamnica) was a bishopric under Roman and Byzantine rule, but it disappeared due to the Islamic rule.\nIn 1701, Eastern Catholics (Byzantine Rite) established anew an Eparchy of Baalbek, which in 1964 was promoted to the present Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Baalbek.\n\nTitular see\nIn the Latin Church, the Ancient diocese was only nominally restored (no later than 1876) as Titular archbishopric of Heliopolis (Latin) / Eliopoli (Curiate Italian), demoted in 1925 to Episcopal Titular bishopric, promoted back in 1932, with its name changed (avoiding Egyptian confusion) in 1933 to (non-Metropolitan) Titular archbishopric of Heliopolis in Phoenicia.\nThe title has not been assigned since 1965.

          "summary": "Baalbek (; Arabic: بَعْلَبَكّ, romanized: Baʿlabakk; Syriac: ܒܥܠܒܟ) is a city located east of the Litani River in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, about 67 km (42 mi) northeast of Beirut. It is the capital of Baalbek-Hermel Governorate. In 1998, the city had a population of 82,608. Most of the population consists of Shia Muslims, followed by Sunni Muslims and Christians; in 2017, there was also a large presence of Syrian refugees.\nBaalbek's history dates back at least 11,000 years. After Alexander the Great conquered the city in 334 BCE, he renamed it Heliopolis (Ἡλιούπολις, Greek for \"Sun City\"). The city flourished under Roman rule. However, it underwent transformations during the Christianization period and the subsequent rise of Islam following the Arab conquest in the 7th century. In later periods, the city was sacked by the Mongols and faced a series of earthquakes, resulting in a decline in importance during the Ottoman and modern periods.\nIn the modern era, Baalbek is a tourist destination. It is known for the ruins of the Roman temple complex, which includes the Temple of Bacchus and the Temple of Jupiter, and was inscribed in 1984 as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Other tourist attractions are the Great Umayyad Mosque, the Baalbek International Festival, the mausoleum of Sit Khawla, and a Roman quarry site named Hajar al-Hibla. Baalbek's tourism sector has encountered challenges due to conflicts in Lebanon, particularly the 1975–1990 civil war, the ongoing Syrian civil war since 2011, and the Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present).\nBaalbek is considered to be part of Hezbollah's heartland and is known to be their political stronghold. During the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon (1982–2000), the group managed to overpower the Lebanese army in Baalbek and gain control of the city. The settlement was subsequently used as a base to recruit and train men for attacks against Israeli forces. Hezbollah continues to hold significant political influence and popular support in Baalbek. In the 2022 Lebanese general election the Amal-Hezbollah list won 9 out of 10 seats in the Baalbek-Hermel Governorate.\nIsrael has conducted numerous airstrikes and raids against military and civilian targets in the Baalbek area in the past decades. For instance, in 2006 during the Operation Sharp and Smooth, Israeli commandos raided a hospital and bombed multiple houses, killing two Hezbollah fighters and at least eleven civilians. In 2024, during the Israel–Hezbollah conflict, Israel sent forced displacement calls for the entire city. Shortly after, Israeli airstrikes killed 19 people, including 8 women.",

          "content": "The Temple of Bacchus is part of the Baalbek archaeological site, in Beqaa Valley region of Lebanon. The temple complex is considered an outstanding archaeological and artistic site of Imperial Roman Architecture and was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984. This monument to Bacchus is one of the best preserved and grandest Roman temple ruins; its age is unknown, but its fine ornamentation can be dated to the second century CE.\n\nHistory\nThe temple was probably commissioned by Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius (r. AD 138-161).  No information was recorded about the site until a 4th-century Greek conquest, by which point the temple would likely have been closed due to the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. When the complex fell into disrepair, the Temple of Bacchus was possibly protected by the rubble of the rest of the site's ruins. \nIt was not until 1898–1903 that a German expedition excavated two of the large temples and began reconstructions on the site. In 1920, the State of Greater Lebanon was proclaimed and protections and repairs of the site were mandated by the Lebanese government. \nIn the mid-1970's the Lebanese civil war broke out and protections of the site ceased as Al-Biqā became a stronghold for Palestinian and Syrian forces.  In 1984 the ruins at Baalbek were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Preservation of the site began in the 1990s following the end of the war. \nThe German Archaeological Institute's Orient Department has done a number of archaeological excavations and research on The Temple of Bacchus and the entire temple complex.\n\nArchitecture\nThe temple is 66 m long, 35 m wide and 31 m high, making it only slightly smaller than the Temple of Jupiter. The podium on which the temple sits is on an East-West axis.  The peripheral wall is adorned by a colonnade of forty-two unfluted Corinthian columns with Ionic bases,\nnineteen of which remain upright. There are eight columns along each end and fifteen along each side —nearly 20 m (66 ft) in height. These were probably erected in a rough state and then rounded, polished, and decorated in position. The columns support a richly carved entablature, which includes an architrave with a three-banded frieze that is decorated with alternating bulls and lions and cornice ornamented with geometric and floral patterns. \nInside, the cella is decorated with Corinthian pilasters flanking two levels of niches on each side. The parapets are decorated with dancing Maenads, supporting the attribution of the temple to Bacchus. The interior of the temple is divided into a 98 ft (30 m) nave and a 36 ft (11 m) adytum or sanctuary  on a platform raised 5 ft (2 m) above it and fronted by 13 steps.\nThe entrance was preserved as late as the 16th century, but the keystone of the lintel had slid 2 ft (1 m) following the 1759 earthquakes; a column of rough masonry was erected in the 1860s or '70s to support it. The earthquakes also damaged the area around the soffit's famed inscription of an eagle, which was entirely covered by the keystone's supporting column.  Some historic Roman coins depict the structure of this temple along with Temple of Jupiter.\nThe Temple is enriched by some of the most refined reliefs and sculpture to survive from antiquity.  There are four sculptures carved within the peristyle that are believed to be depictions of Acarina which would make them the first recognizable representations of mites in architecture.\n\nSee also\nTemple of Jupiter (Baalbek)\nList of Ancient Roman temples\n\nGallery\nNotes\nBibliography\nButcher, Kevin (2003).

          "content": "Byblos ( BIB-loss; Ancient Greek: Βύβλος), also known as Jebeil, Jbeil or Jubayl (Arabic: جُبَيْل, romanized: Jubayl, locally Jbeil [ʒ(ə)beːl]), is an ancient city in the Keserwan-Jbeil Governorate of Lebanon. The area is believed to have been first settled between 8800 and 7000 BC and continuously inhabited since 5000 BC. During its history, Byblos was part of numerous cultures including Egyptian, Phoenician, Assyrian, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, Genoese, Mamluk and Ottoman. Urbanisation is thought to have begun during the third millennium BC when it developed into a city, making it one of the oldest cities in the world,  if not the oldest. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nIt was in Ancient Byblos that the Phoenician alphabet, the ancestor of the Greek, Latin and all other Western alphabets, was developed.\n\nEtymology\nThe name appears as kbnj in Egyptian hieroglyphic records going back to the 4th-dynasty pharaoh Sneferu (fl. 2600 BC) and as Gubla (𒁺𒆷) in the Akkadian cuneiform Amarna letters to the 18th-dynasty pharaohs Amenhotep III and IV. In the 1st millennium BC, its name appeared in Phoenician and Punic inscriptions as Gebal (𐤂𐤁𐤋, GBL); in the Hebrew Bible as Geval (גבל); and in Syriac as GBL (ܓܒܠ). Eusebius' Onomasticon stated that Byblos was called \"Gobel / Gebal\" in Hebrew. The name seems to derive from GB (𐤂𐤁, \"well\") and ʾL (𐤀𐤋, \"god\"), the latter a word that could variously refer to any of the Canaanite gods or to their leader in particular. The name thus seems to have meant the \"Well of the God\" or \"Source of the God\".\nIts present Arabic name Jubayl (جبيل) or J(e)beil is a direct descendant of these earlier names, although apparently modified by a misunderstanding of the name as the triliteral root GBL or JBL, meaning \"mountain\". When the Arabic form of the name is used, it is typically rendered Jbeil, Jbail, or Jbayl in English. All of these, along with Byblos, are etymologically related. During the Crusades, this name appeared in Western records as Gibelet or Giblet. This name was used for Byblos Castle and its associated lordship.\nThe Phoenician City, known to the Greeks as Býblos (Βύβλος) and to the Romans as Byblus, was important for their import of papyrus out of Ancient Egypt – to the extent that \"byblos\" came to mean \"papyrus\" in Greek. The English word \"Bible\", therefore, ultimately derives from the Greek name of the city, Βύβλος ('Βύblos / Byblos'), a Greek mumbo-jumble of גְּבָל ('Gāḇal / Gəbal Gobâl'..., that is, 'Gebal' or 'Jebel'), which shares the same root as גְּבוּל ('Gəḇūl / Gābūl, that is 'Gebul' or 'Jabul'), as they're derivatives of ג־ב־ל ('g-ḇ-l' / 'g-b-l' / 'g-v-l'), which means 'twist as a rope', '(be a, set) border' or 'bound(aria)', which tells us that it is a North Boundary of Canaan.\n\nHistory and archaeology\nSituated approximately 42 km (26 mi) north of Beirut, Byblos holds a strong allure for archaeologists due to its accumulations of various strata resulting from countless centuries of human dwelling. The initial excavation was conducted by Ernest Renan in 1860, documented in his work \"Mission de Phénicie\" (1865–1874). This was succeeded by Pierre Montet's efforts from 1921 to 1924, and later by Maurice Dunand, who continued excavations from 1925 for a span of forty years. Renan's expedition was to \"provide the evidence that the city did not move and that Gebeil is Byblos\".\nFragments attributed to the semi-legendary pre-Homeric Phoenician priest Sanchuniathon say Byblos was the first city erected in Phoenicia and was established by the god Cronus. (Cronus was considered the nearest equivalent to the Canaanite Baal / Baal Hammon in the syncretising system used by the ancient Greeks and Romans.) According to the writer Philo of Byblos (quoting Sanchuniathon, and quoted in Eusebius), Byblos was founded by the Phoenician shrine god El (whom the Greeks identified with their god Cronus). During the 3rd millennium BC, the first signs of a town can be observed, with the remains of well-built houses of uniform size. This was the period when the Canaanite civilization began to develop.\n\nNeolithic and Chalcolithic levels\nNeolithic remains of some buildings can be observed at the site. Jacques Cauvin published studies of flint tools from the stratified Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites in 1962. Remains of humans found in Chalcolithic burials have been published by Henri Victor Vallois in 1937. Tombs from this era were discussed by Emir Maurice Chehab in 1950. Early pottery found at the tell was published by E.S. Boynton in 1960 with further studies by R. Erich in 1954 and Van Liere and Henri de Contenson in 1964.\n\nDunand's five-level stratigraphy\nPrehistoric settlements at Byblos were divided up by Dunand into the following five periods, which were recently expanded and re-calibrated by Yosef Garfinkel to correlate with Tell es-Sultan (Jericho):\n\nEarly Neolithic (early phase) corresponding to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) of Jericho, represented by plastered floors and naviforme technology, dated between 8800 and 7000 BC;\nEarly Neolithic (late phase) corresponding to the PNA of Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) IX (also Yarmukian) between 6400 and 5800 BC, represented by pottery, sickle blades, figurines and small points;\nMiddle Neolithic corresponding to the PNB of Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) VIII and represented by pottery, dated between 5800 and 5300 BC;\nLate Neolithic corresponding to the Middle Chalcolithic of Beth Shean and represented by pottery, stone vessels, silos, chamber tombs and seals, dated between 5300 and 4500 BC;\nEarly Chalcolithic corresponding to the Late Chalcolithic of Ghassulian, represented by jar burials, pierced flint, churn and a violin figurine, dated to between 4500 and 3600 BC and,\nLate Chalcolithic corresponding to the Early Bronze Age, represented by architecture and cylinder seal impressions, dated to between 3600 and 3100 BC.\nThe site first appears to have been settled during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period, approximately 8800 to 7000 BC (Durand's Early Neolithic).\nEarly Neolithic Byblos was a later settlement than others in the Beqaa Valley such as Labweh and Ard Tlaili. It was located on the seaward slope of the larger of the two hills that used to compose ancient Byblos, with a watered valley in between.\n\nThe original site spread down into the valley and covered an area of 1.2 ha (3.0 acres) providing fertile soils and a protected landing place for boats. Dunand discovered around twenty houses although some of the settlement was suggested to have been lost to the sea, robbed or destroyed. Dwellings were rectangular with plastered floors, pottery was usually Dark faced burnished ware with some shell impressions.\nThe Middle Neolithic was a smaller settlement of no more than 0.15 ha (0.37 acres) adjacent to the older site. The pottery was more developed with red washes and more varied forms and elaborate decorations, buildings were poorer with unplastered floors.\nThe Late Neolithic period showed development from the middle in building design, a wider range of more developed flint tools and a far larger variety of pottery with fabrication including silica. The Late Chalcolithic featured developments of \"Canaanite blades\" and fan scrapers. Adult burials in jars started to appear along with metal in the form of one copper hook, found in a jar. Some jars were lined with white plaster that was applied and self-hardened after firing. Copper appeared more frequently in the Late Chalcolithic period along with multiple burials in tombs and jar handles with impressed signs.\n\nEarly Bronze\nAccording to Lorenzo Nigro, Byblos moved from being a fishermen's village to its earlier urban form at the beginning of the third millennium BC.  Early Bronze Age remains were characterised by the development of Byblos combed ware and a lithic assemblage studied by Jacques Cauvin.\nWatson Mills and Roger Bullard suggest that during the Old Kingdom of Egypt and Middle Kingdom of Egypt Byblos was virtually an Egyptian colony. The growing city was a wealthy one and seems to have been an ally (among \"those who are on his waters\") of Egypt for many centuries. First Dynasty tombs used timbers from Byblos. One of the oldest Egyptian words for an oceangoing boat was \"Byblos ship\". Archaeologists have recovered Egyptian-made artifacts as old as a vessel fragment bearing the name of the Second dynasty ruler Khasekhemwy, although this \"may easily have reached Byblos through trade and/or at a later period\".\n\nMiddle Bronze\nObjects have been found at Byblos naming the 12th Dynasty king Senusret II, the 13th Dynasty Egyptian king Neferhotep I.\n\nLate Bronze\nThe rulers of Byblos maintained close relationships with the New Kingdom pharaohs of Ancient Egypt.\nAround 1350 BC, the Amarna letters include 60 letters from Rib-Hadda and his successor Ili-Rapih who were rulers of Byblos, writing to the Egyptian government. This is mainly due to Rib-Hadda's constant pleas for military assistance from Akhenaten. They also deal with the conquest of neighbouring city-states by the Habiru.\nIt appears Egyptian contact peaked during the 19th dynasty, only to decline during the 20th and 21st dynasties. In addition, when the New Kingdom collapsed in the 11th century BC, Byblos ceased being a colony and became the foremost city of Phoenicia. Although the archaeological evidence seems to indicate a brief resurgence during the 22nd and 23rd dynasties, it is clear after the Third Intermediate Period the Egyptians started favouring Tyre and Sidon instead of Byblos.\nArchaeological evidence at Byblos, particularly the five Byblian royal inscriptions dating back to around 1200–1000 BC, shows existence of a Phoenician alphabet of twenty-two characters; an important example is the Ahiram sarcophagus. The use of the alphabet was spread by Phoenician merchants through their maritime trade into parts of North Africa and Europe. One of the most important monuments of this period is the Temple of the Obelisks, dedicated to the Canaanite war god Resheph, but this had fallen into ruins by the time of Alexander the Great.\n\nIron Age\nIn the Assyrian period, Sibittibaal of Byblos became tributary to Tiglath-Pileser III in 738 BC, and in 701 BC, when Sennacherib conquered all Phoenicia, the king of Byblos was Urumilki. Byblos was also subject to Assyrian kings Esarhaddon (r. 681–669 BC) and Ashurbanipal (r. 668–627 BC), under its kings Milkiasaph and Yehawmelek.\nIn the Achaemenid Empire (538–332 BC), Byblos was the fourth of four Phoenician vassal kingdoms established by the Persians; the first three being Sidon, Tyr, and Arwad.\n\nClassical antiquity\nHellenistic rule came with the arrival of Alexander the Great in the area in 332 BC. Coinage was in use, and there is abundant evidence of continued trade with other Mediterranean countries.\n\nDuring the Greco-Roman period, the temple of Resheph was elaborately rebuilt, and the city, though smaller than its neighbours such as Tyrus and Zidonia, was a centre for the cult of Adonis.\nKing Herod of Judaea, known for his extensive building projects, including beyond his own kingdom, constructed a city wall for Byblos.\nIn the 3rd century, a small but impressive theatre was constructed. With the rise of Christianity, a bishopric was established in Byblos, and the town grew rapidly. Although a Sasanian colony is known to have been established in the region following the early Muslim conquests of 636, there is little archaeological evidence for it. Trade with Europe effectively dried up, and it was not until the coming of the First Crusade in 1098 that prosperity returned to Byblos, known then as Gibelet or Giblet.\n\nCrusader, Mamluk, Ottoman period\nIn the 12th and 13th century, Byblos became part of the County of Tripoli, a Crusader state connected to, but largely independent from, the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem.\nAs Gibelet or Giblet, it came under the rule of the Genoese Embriaco family, who created for themselves the Lordship of Gibelet, first as administrators of the city in the name of the Republic of Genoa, and then as a hereditary fief, undertaking to pay an annual fee to Genoa and the church of San Lorenzo (Genoa's Cathedral).\nThe Embriaco family's residence, the Byblos Castle, along with the fortified town, served as an important military base for the Crusaders. The remains of the castle are among the most impressive architectural structures now visible in the town centre. The town was taken by Saladin in 1187, re-taken by the Crusaders, and conquered by Baibars in 1266, but it remained in the possession of the Embriacos until around 1300.\nHaving voluntarily surrendered to the Mamluks, the city was relatively spared from looting following its capture. Its fortifications were subsequently restored by Baybars. From 1516 until 1918, the town and the whole region became part of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nContemporary history\nByblos and all of Lebanon were placed under French Mandate from 1920 until 1943 when Lebanon achieved independence. The 2006 Lebanon War negatively affected the ancient city by covering its harbour and town walls with an oil slick that was the result of an oil spill from a nearby power plant.\nDuring the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, UNESCO gave Byblos and 33 other cultural sites enhanced protection to safeguard them against damage.\n\nDemographics\nByblos's inhabitants are significantly Christian, mostly Maronite, with minorities of Armenian Apostolic, Greek Orthodox, and Greek Catholics. There is also a minority of Shia and Sunni Muslims. It is said that the predominantly  Shi`i city of Bint Jbeil (\"Daughter of Byblos\") in Southern Lebanon was founded by Shi`a migrants from Byblos. Byblos has three representatives in the Parliament of Lebanon: two Maronites and one Shi`i Muslim.\n\nEducation\nByblos is home to the professional schools of the Lebanese American University (LAU). The LAU Byblos Campus houses the Medical School, the Engineering School, the School of Architecture and Design, the Pharmacy School, which offers the only Pharm.D. Program outside the United States accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), the School of Business, and the School of Arts and Sciences.\n\nTourism\nByblos is re-emerging as an upscale touristic hub. With its ancient port, Phoenician, Roman, and Crusader ruins, sandy beaches and the picturesque mountains that surround it make it an ideal tourist destination. The city is known for its fish restaurants, open-air bars, and outdoor cafes. Yachts cruise into its harbor today as they did in the 1960s and 1970s when Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra were regular visitors to the city. Byblos was crowned as the \"Arab Tour Capital\" for the year 2016 by the Lebanese minister of tourism in the Grand Serail in Beirut. Byblos was chosen by Condé Nast Traveler as the second best city in the Middle East for 2012, beating Tel Aviv and Dubai, and by the World Tourism Organization as the best Arab tourist city for 2013.\n\nThe Byblos archaeological site\nAin el-Malik or King's Spring, about 20 m deep, is a large cavity accessible by spiral stairs. Once it supplied the city with water. According to Plutarch's version of the Egyptian Osiris myth, the king's servants met Isis on the stairs of the spring and took her to the royal palace, where she found the body of her husband Osiris embedded in one of the palace pillars.\n\nThe L-shaped Temple was erected about 2700 BC.\n\nThe Temple of the Obelisks, originally built in 1600–1200 BC on top of the “L-shaped temple,” was moved by archaeologists to its present location. The many small obelisks found in this temple were used as religious offerings. The sanctuary contained a large number of human figurines made of bronze covered with gold leaf, which are now displayed in the National Museum of Beirut.\nThe royal necropolis dates back to the second millennium BC and contains tombs of the Byblos kings, including King Ahiram.\nThe Bronze Age necropolis of the Gebalite elite, discovered in 2019 at the southern outskirts of the ancient city acropolis.\nThe Roman theater was built around AD 218.\n\nOther historic buildings\nByblos Wax Museum\n\nThe Byblos Wax Museum displays wax statues of characters whose dates of origin range from Phoenician times to current days.\n\nByblos Fossil Museum\n\nThe Byblos Fossil Museum has a collection of fossilised fish, sharks, eel, flying fish, and other marine life, some of which are millions of years old.\n\nMedieval city wall\nThe old medieval part of Byblos is surrounded by walls running about 270m from east to west and 200m from north to south.\n\nByblos Castle\n\nByblos Castle was built by the Crusaders in the 12th century. It is located in the archaeological site near the port.\n\nSt John the Baptist Church\nWork on the church started during the Crusades in 1115. It was considered a cathedral and was partially destroyed during an earthquake in AD 1170. It was later given to the Maronite bishop as a gift by Prince Yusuf Shihab.\n\nSultan Abduljid Mosque\nThe old mosque by the Castle dates back to the Mamluk period, and adopted the name of Sultan Abdulmejid I after he renovated it.\n\nHistoric Quarter and Souks\nIn the southeast section of the historic city, near the entrance of the archaeological site, is an old market.\n\nByblos International Festival\n\nThis summer music festival is an annual event that takes place in the historic quarter.\n\nTemple of Baalat Gebal\n\nAram Bezikian Museum\nThe Armenian Genocide Orphans' Aram Bezikian Museum is a museum dedicated to preserving the memory of the Armenian Genocide and its survivors.\n\nNotable people\nMajdi Allawi (born 1970), Maronite priest, association founder\nJihad Azour (born 1966), economist\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nByblos is twinned with:\n\n Bonifacio, France\n Mangalia, Romania\n Orange, France\n Patras, Greece\n\nGallery\nSee also\nByblos syllabary\nCities of the ancient Near East\nDugurasu\n\nNotes\nReferences\nHead, Barclay; et al.

          "content": "Sidon ( SY-dən), or Saida ( SY-də, SAH-id-ə; Arabic: صيدا, romanized: Ṣaydā), is the third-largest city in Lebanon. It is located on the Mediterranean coast in the South Governorate, of which it is the capital. Tyre, to the south, and the Lebanese capital of Beirut, to the north, are each about 40 kilometres (25 miles) away. Sidon has a population of about 80,000 within the city limits, while its metropolitan area has more than a quarter-million inhabitants.\n\nEtymology\nThe Phoenician name Ṣīdūn (𐤑𐤃𐤍, ṢDN) probably meant \"fishery\" or \"fishing town\". It is mentioned in Papyrus Anastasi I as ḏjdwnꜣ. It appears in Biblical Hebrew as Ṣīḏōn (Hebrew: צִידוֹן) and in Syriac as Ṣidon (ܨܝܕܘܢ). This was Hellenised as Sidṓn (Ancient Greek: Σιδών), which was Latinised as Sidon and entered English in this form. The name appears in Classical Arabic as Ṣaydūn (صَيْدونْ) and in Modern Arabic as Ṣaydā (صَيْدَا).\nAs a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and given the formal name Colonia Aurelia Pia Sidon to honour its imperial sponsor.\nDuring the crusades, Sidon was known in Latin as Sagittus and in Old French as Saete, Sayette or Sagette.\nIn the Book of Genesis, Sidon was the first-born son of Canaan, who was a son of Ham, making Sidon a great-grandson of Noah.\n\nHistory\nIn antiquity, Sidon held prominence as a significant Phoenician city. It was nestled on a mainland promontory and boasted two harbors. Throughout ancient history, Sidon had many conquerors: Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, and finally Romans. Under Persian rule, it eclipsed Tyre to become the paramount city in Phoenicia. In the New Testament era, Herod the Great visited Sidon. Both Jesus and Saint Paul are said to have visited it, too (see Biblical Sidon below). The city was eventually conquered by the Arabs and then by the Ottoman Turks.\n\nPrehistory\nSidon has been inhabited since very early in prehistory. The archaeological site of Sidon II shows a lithic assemblage dating to the Acheulean, whilst finds at Sidon III include a Heavy Neolithic assemblage suggested to date just prior to the invention of pottery.\n\nMiddle Bronze\nMiddle Bronze IIA\nIn late MB IIA, Sidon Level 4 became an important port trading with Egypt (late 12th and early 13th dynasties).\n\nLate Bronze\nLate Bronze II\nAmarna period. Around 1350 BC, Sidon was part of the Egyptian Empire and ruled by Zimredda of Sidon. During the Amarna Period, Egypt went into decline, leading to uprising and turmoil in the Levant. There was rivalry between Lebanese coastal city-states fighting for dominance, with Abimilku of Tyre in the south, and Rib-Hadda of Byblos in the north. Byblos became significantly weakened as the dominant city on the Lebanese coast. Further north, the Akkar Plain rebelled and became the kingdom of Amurru with Hittite support. The Mitanni Empire, an ally of the Egyptians, had dominated Syria but now fell apart due to the military campaigns of Suppiluliuma I of Hatti. Tutankhamun and his general Horemheb scrambled to keep Egyptian control over southern Levant, as the Hittites became overlords in the north.\nThe oldest testimony documenting words in the Phoenician language of Sidon, is also from this period. The Book of Deuteronomy (3, 9) reads: \"the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion\". In other words: Mount Hermon was called \"Sirion\", in (the Phoenician language of) Sidon.\n\nIron Age\nSidon was one of the most important Phoenician cities, and it may have been the oldest. From there and other ports, a great Mediterranean commercial empire was founded. Homer praised the skill of its craftsmen in producing glass, purple dyes, and its women's skill at the art of embroidery. It was also from here that a colonising party went to found the city of Tyre. Tyre also grew into a great city, and in subsequent years there was competition between the two, each claiming to be the metropolis ('Mother City') of Phoenicia.\nDuring the Phoenician era, Sidon thrived on two pivotal industries: glass manufacturing and purple dye production. The city's glass production operated on an extensive scale, while the manufacturing of purple dye held nearly equal importance. The magnitude of Sidon's purple dye production was evident through a considerable mound of discarded Murex trunculus shells discovered near the southern harbor. These shells were broken to extract the precious pigment, so rare that it became synonymous with royalty.\nIn AD 1855, the sarcophagus of King Eshmun’azar II was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a \"king of the Sidonians,\" probably in the 5th century BC, and that his mother was a priestess of ‘Ashtart, \"the goddess of the Sidonians.\" In this inscription the gods Eshmun and Ba‘al Sidon 'Lord of Sidon' (who may or may not be the same) are mentioned as chief gods of the Sidonians. ‘Ashtart is entitled ‘Ashtart-Shem-Ba‘al, '‘Ashtart the name of the Lord', a title also found in an Ugaritic text.\nNebuchadnezzar II subjugated the city to be part of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Sidon's navy played a significant role in the Battle of Salamis in 480 BC, aligning with the Persian fleet against the Greeks. From the mid-fifth century BC onward, warships became a prominent feature on the city's coinage. At the end of the Persian era, in 351 BC, Phoenicia was invaded by Artaxerxes III.\n\nPersian and Hellenistic periods\nLike other Phoenician city-states, Sidon suffered from a succession of conquerors, first by the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BC, ending with its occupation by Alexander the Great in 333 BC, and the start of the Hellenistic period of Sidon's history. The Persian influence seems to have been profound, as is observed in the change of the architectural style of the city. \nIn exchange for supporting his conquest of Egypt, King Cambyses II of Persia awarded Sidon with the territories of Dor, Joppa, and the Plain of Sharon.\nUnder the Diadochi or successors of Alexander, it enjoyed relative autonomy and organised games and competitions in which the greatest athletes of the region participated. In the Hellenistic period necropolis of Sidon, important finds such as the Alexander Sarcophagus (likely the tomb of King Abdalonymus rather than Alexander), the Lycian tomb and the Sarcophagus of the Crying Women were discovered, which are now on display at the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul.\n\nRoman period\nWhen Sidon fell under Roman domination, it continued to mint its own silver coins. The city was embellished by Herod, king of Judaea, who built there a theatre. By the First Jewish–Roman War, Sidon sheltered enough Jews that local pagans hesitated to attack them during the broader massacre of Jews in Greco-Syrian towns in 66 CE, as documented by Josephus.\nThe Romans built a theater and other major monuments in the city, and an underground Mithraeum was discovered. In the reign of Elagabalus, a Roman colony was established there. The Philogelos, a Greek-language joke book written circa the 4th century AD, features a series of jokes about Sidonians, who are stereotyped as unintelligent and literal-minded. During the Byzantine Empire, when the great earthquake of AD 551 destroyed most of the cities of Phoenice, the law school of Berytus took refuge in Sidon. The town continued quietly for the next century, until the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 636.\n\nCrusader-Ayyubid period\nOn 4 December 1110, Sidon was captured after the siege of Sidon, a decade after the First Crusade, by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem and King Sigurd I of Norway. It then became the center of the Lordship of Sidon, an important vassal-state of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Saladin captured it from the Crusaders in 1187, but German Crusaders restored it to Christian control in the Crusade of 1197. It remained an important Crusader stronghold until it was destroyed by the Ayyubids in 1249. In 1260, it was again destroyed by the Mongols led by Kitbuqa. The remains of the original walls are still visible.\nDuring the 12th century, Benjamin of Tudela noted the presence of approximately twenty Jews, possibly Jewish families, in Sidon, which he described as a \"large city.\"\n\nOttoman period\nAfter Sidon came under Ottoman Turkish rule in the early 16th century, it became the capital of the Sidon Eyalet (province) and regained a great deal of its earlier commercial importance. In 1521, Moses Basola encountered twenty families of Musta'rabi Jews during his visit to Sidon.\nDuring the 18th century, the city was dominated by the Hammud family of notables, who monopolized the production and exporting of cotton in the region and built numerous palaces and public works in the city. The Hammuds also served as government customs agents and tax collectors for various Ottoman religious foundations.\nDuring the Egyptian–Ottoman War, Sidon, like much of Ottoman Syria, was occupied by the forces of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. His ambitions were opposed by the British Empire, which backed the Ottomans. The British Admiral Charles Napier, commanding a mixed squadron of British, Turkish and Austrian ships, bombarded Sidon on 26 September 1840, and landed with a column. Sidon capitulated in two days, and the British went on to Acre. This action was recalled in two Royal Navy vessels being named HMS Sidon.\nThe 19th century brought significant changes to the Jewish community of Sidon. By 1830, the community, comprising around twenty-five families of primarily Arabic-speaking merchants, had customs akin to those of Judean Jews. Starting in 1850, the community witnessed growth as Maghrebi Jews, initially settled in the Chouf Mountains above Beirut, migrated to Sidon and Beirut amidst escalating Druze-Maronite tensions and the ensuing 1860 war. With roots in mountain traditions, they introduced citrus cultivation on the outskirts of Sidon, leading to the construction of a new synagogue in 1860 to meet the needs of the expanding community.\nFrom 1887 the Royal necropolis of Sidon was extensively excavated by the Ottomans, and its treasures transferred to Istanbul (like the Alexander sarcophagus). Sidon was a small fishing town of 10,000 inhabitants in 1900.\n\nAfter World War I\nAfter World War I it became part of the French Mandate of Lebanon. During World War II the city, together with the rest of Lebanon, was captured by British forces fighting against the Vichy French, and following the war it became a major city of independent Lebanon. Following the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, Palestinian refugees arrived in Sidon, as in other Lebanese cities, and were settled at the large refugee camps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh. At first these consisted of enormous rows of tents, but gradually houses were constructed. The refugee camps constituted de facto neighborhoods of Sidon, but had a separate legal and political status which made them into a kind of enclaves. At the same time, the remaining Jews of the city fled, and the Jewish cemetery fell into disrepair, threatened by coastal erosion.\nOn Easter Sunday, 19 April 1981, at least sixteen people were killed in Sidon after the (South Lebanon Army) SLA's long-range artillery indiscriminately shelled the city centre. It was reported that it was in response to a request from Bashir Gemayel in connection with ongoing Syrian attacks on Phalangist positions around Zahle. Israel denied involvement. After the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Sidon was occupied by the Israeli army for almost two and a half years.\nOn 18 August 1997, following a roadside bomb near Jezzine which killed two teenage members of a SLA leader's family, SLA artillery shelled Sidon killing seven civilians and wounding thirty-five. Hizbollah responded the following day by firing 60–80 rockets into the security zone and northern Israel. According to UNIFIL observers the missiles appeared to be targeted at uninhabited areas. The attack on Sidon is credited with leading to a truce between Hizbollah and Amal and increased cooperation between the two groups and the Lebanese Army. This was evident in the Ansariya ambush the following month.\nOn 8 June 1999, two gunmen entered the Palais de Justice, Sidon's main courthouse, and shot dead three magistrates and a chief prosecutor. The attackers escaped. No group claimed responsibility but suspicion focused on Osbat al-Ansar whose leader had been sentenced to death in absentia for the murder of the head of the Sufi Al-Ahbash movement and the attempted assassination of the mufti of Tripoli. He was believed to be in hiding in the Ain al-Hilwa refugee camp.\nStudies in 2000 showed a population of 65,000 in the city, and around 200,000 in the metropolitan area. The little level land around the city is used for cultivation of wheat, vegetables, and fruits, especially citrus and bananas. The fishing in the city remains active with a newly opened fishery that sells fresh fish by bidding every morning. The ancient basin was transformed into a fishing port, while a small quay was constructed to receive small commercial vessels (see \"Old City\" and the \"Architecture and landscape\" sections below).\n\nSaida Municipal Stadium was inaugurated in 2000 for the Asian Football Confederation's Cup 2000.\n\nPolitics\nThis sectarian and demographic division rose to the surface during the Lebanese Civil War, when armed clashes erupted between Sunni Muslims and Christians. The clashes ended with the surrender of the Christian front, and Christians were forced to move to east Beirut. After the war ended in 1990, some Christians gradually returned to their hometowns but in 2000 many fled to Israel. The local politics of Sidon in the 20th century was mainly dominated up till the 1980s by allegiances around two main families, the El-Bizri and Saad. The El-Bizri politicians were known for their business connections, close ties with eminent Lebanese and Levantine leaders, and their bent on serving the Lebanese state as government ministers, officials and mayors. The Saad politicians tended to be populist and became engaged in violent protests in the 1940s, 1950s and then during the Lebanese civil war as Nasserites (populist followers of Nasser in Lebanon).\nThe local political conflict between these two families was always resolved through amicable means and ties of kinship. Their hold over the political aspects of the city was similar to that of Mediterranean families in Sicily or to being also influenced by the ties of Arab families, clans, and tribes in traditionalist forms. The most notable figures of the El-Bizri family in the first half of the 20th century were: Ahmad El-Bizri (born 1899), Salah El-Bizri, Eizeddine El-Bizri (commonly known as Eizzo) and Anwar El-Bizri (born 1910). These four brothers were businessmen and politicians who dominated the political life of the city up till the late 1940s, using traditional inherited forms of governance since Ottoman times. With intelligence and strength they maintained their power for over 50 years. It is from their ranks that Maarouf Saad started his public life, and their close cousins, Nazih El-Bizri, Amin El-Bizri, and Fouad El-Bizri became the next generation of politicians and statesmen in Lebanon; holding positions as ministers and members of parliament.\nThe El-Bizri and the Saad political practices were bent on social justice and on local service in public affairs. The El-Bizri were since the Ottoman rule bent on serving the state, and this continued with their loyalty and support to the successive governments of Lebanon since the times of independence. They also helped eminent politicians and statesmen from Sidonian descent such as the Prime Ministers Riad Solh, Takieddine el-Solh and Rashid Solh, they also gave their support to former Prime Minister Saeb Salam, father of Tamam Salam, Prime Minister 2014–2016. The presence of the El-Bizris was at times intimidating on the local scene, but they were also known for their goodwill and dignified public service.\nThe Saad family developed their links with Nasserism in the 1950s and engaged in the uprising and armed protest of 1958 against the government of the Lebanese President Chamoun. They also became involved in the civil war as part of the left wing politics of the Lebanon (Al-Haraka al-Wataniyya) with PLO connections, and they actively contributed to resisting the Israeli occupation after 1982. The Saads remained populist in their politics and focused on the grassroots, while the El-Bizri were generally appealing to the middle and upper classes. In the middle 1980s, the Hariri family began to rise to prominence and became the most influential in Sidon in political and financial terms, even though the presence of the Saad and the El-Bizri in local politics remained significant at the level of visibility and activism. The Saad family developed its original politics from within the sphere of influence of the El-Bizri family and then became a power to reckon with on its own after 1948, and most powerfully in 1958, then in the civil war and until the present today.\nMaarouf Saad, the leader of his family, and a local influential politician, was assassinated at the eve of the Lebanese civil war in 1975. The Saads retained their populism and grassroots appeal, and attracted a core of loyal adherents since the middle of the 20th century. While the El-Bizri were Levantine in their Arabism (namely focused mainly on Bilad al-Shaam in regional politics), and the Solh being also similar to them in this, the Saad were leaning more towards a broader pan-Arabism (Nasserite, Libyan, and then Syrian). The Hariri family started to rise to political and economic prominence in the 1980s and became perhaps the most influential family in Lebanon by the mid-1990s, following modern forms of political practice through a large party (Future Movement) that cuts across various economic classes.\n\nImpact on Sidon of regional underdevelopment\nAccording to a 2013 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report \"data also point to an increase in urban poverty especially in Lebanon's largest cities suburbs such as Beirut, Tripoli and Saida, as illustrated by poverty-driven symptoms (child labour, over-crowding and deteriorated environment conditions).\" In another UNDP report, the author discusses the development predominance of Beirut over the rest of the regions of Lebanon (North, South and Beqaa) is a well-known imbalance that can be dated to the early 19th century. With the expansion of Beirut in the 1870s, urban growth in the future capital outpaced Tripoli and Saida. Transportation routes, missionary schools, universities and hospitals as well as the Beirut port development and the commerce of silk participated to the fortification of Beirut as a major trade center for Mediterranean exchange (ARNAUD 1993; LABAKI 1999: 23). However, the establishment of Great Lebanon in 1920, under the French mandate, added the poorer areas of the North (Akkar), Beqaa (Baalbak-Hermel) and the South (Jabal Aamel) to the relatively affluent cities of Mount Lebanon. This addition made of Lebanon a country composed of unequally developed regions. This legacy remains a heavy load to bear socially, culturally, economically and politically. Even though the public policies elaborated by the young Lebanese State were attempting to have regional perspectives, the early urban planning schemes reveal a development approach exclusively axed on Beirut and its suburbs.\nThe post war development policy of the State, promoted by Hariri government (1992–1998), was centered around balanced development and is widely inspired by the 1943 Pact and the 1989 Taef agreement (LABAKI1993: 104). However the application of this policy aims mainly at the rehabilitation and construction of roads and infrastructures (electricity, telephone, sewage). Another of its components is the rehabilitation of government buildings (airport, port, schools, universities and hospitals). Transportation projects (mainly concentrated on the coastal line) constitute 25% of the budget of 10-year economic plan developed by the CDR (BAALBAKI 1994: 90). However, all these projects are predominantly concentrated around Beirut, ignoring the regions.\n\nThe former Makab (waste dump) and the treatment plant\nNear the southern entrance to the city used to be a 'rubbish mountain' called at the time by the locals the Makab; namely, a 600,000 cubic metre heap that reached the height of a four-story building. It was originally created to dispose of the remains of buildings destroyed in Israeli air strikes during the 1982 invasion, but it then became the main dump for the city. Growing out of the sea, it became an environmental hazard, with medical waste and plastic bags polluting nearby fishing grounds.\nSidon politicians, including the Hariri family, failed for decades to resolve the Makab crisis—which has endangered residents' health (especially during episodic burning). In 2004, Engineer Hamzi Moghrabi, a Sidon native, conceived the idea to establish a treatment plant for the city's decades-old chronic waste problem. He established the privately funded IBC Enviro and the treatment plant became operational in 2013.\nThe Ministry of Environment came up with a $50,000+ plan to clean the whole area and transform the dump into a green space, along with other heaps in the country. Qamla beach in Sidon, a coast in close proximity to the Sea Castle, witnessed a large municipal cleanup in May 2011, as it was an easy target of rubbish being washed up by the Makab. These plans aim to revive the former glory of the city's coasts and attract tourists who avoided swimming in Sidon's sea before. The project of cleaning the region where the waste dump has already started, and currently a waves-barrier is being built, and the vast bulk of the waste dump being cleared.\n\nLocal government\nThe city of Sidon is administered by the Municipality of Sidon. The municipality is constituted of a council of 21 members including the City Mayor and his Deputy. It has administrative and financial independence but remains under the control and supervision of the central government, specifically the Ministry of Interior. The municipality's jurisdiction is limited to a region of 786 hectares in area and 5 meters in elevation, while each of the city's suburbs is administered by its own independent municipal council. Sidon is the center of the Governorate of South Lebanon, and hosts the seat of the Governor of Southern Lebanon. The city is also the center of the Sidon District and the Union of Sidon and Zahrani Municipalities (founded in 1978 and contains 15 municipalities). Sidon hosts the southern regional headquarters of a series of governmental facilities like the Central Bank of Lebanon, Électricité du Liban, Central Telecommunications Station and others. It is also the home of the Justice Palace of South Lebanon in its new headquarters on East Boulevard (the old headquarters were an old Ottoman Saray that is currently occupied by the LSF and is planned to be transformed into a cultural center by the municipality).\nIn the 2000 and 2005 parliamentary elections, the Sidon District along with the Tyre and Bint Jbeil districts formed the first electoral district of South Lebanon. However, in the 2009 elections – and due to the reactivation of the 1960 electoral law – the city of Sidon was separated from its district to form a separate electoral district.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Muslims made up 92.99% and Christians made up 6.49% of registered voters in Sidon. 82.16% of the voters were Sunni Muslims and 10.83% were Shiite Muslims.\nThe overwhelming majority of Sidon's population belong to the Sunni sect of Islam, with a small number of Shiites and Christians. Sidon is the seat of the Greek Melkite Catholic Archbishop of Sidon and Deir el Qamar, and has housed a significant Catholic population throughout its history. Sidon also hosts the seat of the Shiite Ayatollah of South Lebanon.\nIn the 1930s, when Lebanon was still under the French mandate, Sidon had the largest Jewish population in Lebanon, estimated at 3,588, compared to 3,060 in Beirut, however by the end of 1990s most of the Jewish population had emigrated leaving their cemetery and other sites in a state of abandonment.\n\nMain sights\nSidon Sea Castle, a fortress built by the Crusaders in the early 13th century. It is located near the Port of Sidon.\nSidon Soap Museum. It traces the history of the soap making in the region and its different manufacturing steps.\nKhan al-Franj (\"Caravanserai of the French\"), a complex built in the 16th century, though erroneously credited to Emir Fakhreddine II in the 17th century. It gained its name for accommodating French merchants and goods in order to develop trade with Europe. This is a typical khan with a large rectangular courtyard and a central fountain surrounded by covered galleries.\nDebbane Palace, a historical residence built in 1721, an example of Arab-Ottoman architecture. This villa was earlier occupied by the Hammoud family in the 18th century and also by members of the famous Ottoman aristocrats of the Abaza clan in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The vaults at the ground level being originally stables for the villa residents and then turned into shops as part of the old souks, and known until recent time by association to the Abazas.\nThe Castle of St. Louis (Qalaat Al Muizz). It was built by the Crusaders in the 13th century on top of the remains of a fortress built by the Fatimid caliph Al Muizz. It is located to the south of the Old Souks near Murex Hill.\nEshmun Temple, dedicated to the Phoenician god of healing. Built in the 7th century BC, it is located in the north of Sidon near the Awali River.\nThe British War Cemetery in Sidon. Opened in 1943 by units of His Majesty's (King George VI) British Forces occupying the Lebanon after the 1941 campaign against the Vichy French troops. It was originally used for the burial of men who died while serving with the occupation force, but subsequently the graves of a number of the casualties of the 1941 campaign were moved into the cemetery from other burial grounds or from isolated positions in the vicinity. The cemetery now contains 176 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War and nine war graves of other nationalities. It was designed by G. Vey. It is perhaps the only garden in modern Sidon that is elegantly kept and cared for. It is not a public garden, but can be visited when the wardens have its gateways opened.\n\nEducation\nSidon is home to numerous educational facilities ranging from public elementary schools to private universities. According to a 2006 study, the city is home to 29 schools that serve a total of 18,731 students: 37% are in public schools, 63% are in private schools. Sidon also contains 10 universities, 5 of which are private universities.\n\nArchaeology\nThe following archaeological sites in the area indicate settlements from the earliest prehistorical times.\nSidon I, II and III are prehistoric sites, while Sidon I is the tell of ancient Sidon starting from the Early Bronze Age.\nSidon I is an archaeological site located to the east of the city, south of the road to Jezzine. An assemblage of flint tools was found by P. E. Gigues suggested to date between 3800 and 3200 BC. The collection included narrow axes or chisels that were polished on one side and flaked on the other, similar to ones found at Ain Cheikh, Nahr Zahrani and Gelal en Namous. The collection appears to have gone missing from the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut.\nSidon II is said to be \"near the church\" at approximately fifty meters above sea level. P. E. Gigues suggested that the industry found on the surface of this site dated to the Acheulean.\nSidon III was found by E. Passemard  in the 1920s, who made a collection of material that is now in the National Museum of Beirut marked \"Camp de l'Aviation\". It includes large flint and chert bifacials that may be of Heavy Neolithic origin.\nSidon IV is the tell mound of ancient Sidon with Early Bronze Age (c. 3200 BC) deposits, now located underneath the ruined Saint Louis Castle and what are also thought to be the ruins of a Roman theater.\n\nBronze Age city and kingdom\nCity of Sidon (Sidon IV site)\nIn the area of this ruined Crusader castle, recent excavations uncovered a late Early Bronze Age I (EB I) settlement on bedrock. Here, an uninterrupted sequence from EB I to EB III was found. A modest third-millennium BC settlement consisting of domestic installations and tombs was also uncovered. Yet the following history of Sidon was not clarified. Very little has been known about the location, extent, and significance of Middle Bronze Age (MBA) Sidon until recently.\n\nTell el-Burak MBA settlement\nSince the early 21st century, Tell el-Burak excavations have helped significantly in this area, because it was an active settlement during MBA, and quite well preserved. Tell el-Burak is located along the coast 9 km south from Sidon. Previously, there was a big gap in the history of this whole coastal area from the end of the Early Bronze Age until the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, when Sidon is first mentioned in the historical texts.\n\nMBA kingdom of Sidon\nArchaeologists determined that Sidon was clearly the big power centre during MBA, controlling significant territory. So there appears to have been the \"Kingdom of Sidon\" that controlled el-Burak, and many other surrounding areas.\n\nExcavation history\nThe area around Sidon contains a number of important necropoli (below in order of age, and noting their principal excavators):\n\nDakerman (Roger Saidah, 1968–1969)\nTambourit (Saidah, 1977)\nMagharet Abloun (Aimé Péretié, 1855; Ernest Renan, 1864; Georges Contenau, 1920)\nAyaa (William King Eddy, 1887; Osman Hamdi Bey, 1892; Contenau, 1920)\nAin al-Hilweh (Charles Cutler Torrey, 1919–1920)\nEl-Merah (Contenau, 1920)\nQrayé (Contenau, 1920)\nAlmoun, (Conenau, 1924)\nEl-Harah (Theodore Makridi, 1904; Contenau, 1924)\nMagharet Abloun, Greco-Roman part (Renan, 1864; Contenau, 1914–1924)\nHelalié/Baramié/Mar Elias (William John Bankes, 1816; Renan 1864; Contenau, 1914; M. Meurdrac & L. Albanèse, 1938–1939)\nIn indication of the high-profile of the old city of Sidon in archaeological expeditions, and mainly in the 19th century, in October 1860 the famous French scholar Ernest Renan was entrusted with an archaeological mission to Lebanon, which included the search for the antique parts of Sidon. The Phoenician inscriptions that he discovered, and his field data, were eventually published in his notebook the: Mission de Phénicie (1864–1874; Phoenician Expedition).\nThe St. Louis castle grounds were excavated in 1914–1920 by a French team. Then eastwards a new site was also excavated by another generation of French expeditions in the 1960s. This same site received renewed attention in 1998 when the Directorate General of Antiquities in Lebanon authorized the British Museum to begin excavations on this area of land that was specifically demarcated for archaeological research. This has resulted in published papers, with a special focus on studying ceramics.\nThe archaeological fieldwork was not fully undertaken since the independence of the Lebanon. The main finds are displayed in the National Museum in Beirut. The fieldwork was also interrupted during the long civil war period, and it is now resumed but at a timid and slow scale, and not involving major international expeditions or expertise. Perhaps this is also indicative of the general lack in cultural interests among the authorities of this city, and almost of the non-existence of notable intellectual activities in its modern life. There are signs that the locals are beginning to recognize the value of the medieval quarters, but this remains linked to minor individual initiatives and not a coordinated collective effort to rehabilitate it like it has been the case with Byblos, even though the old district of Sidon contains a great wealth in old and ancient architecture.\nDuring the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, UNESCO gave enhanced protection to 34 cultural sites in Lebanon including the archaeological sites at Sidon to safeguard them from damage.\n\nIn the Bible\nHebrew Bible/Old Testament\nThe Hebrew Bible describes Sidon (צִידוֹן‎) in several passages:\n\nIt received its name from the \"first-born\" of Canaan, the grandson of Noah.\nThe Tribe of Zebulun has a frontier on Sidon\nIt was the first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Canaan, and from its extensive commercial relations became a \"great\" city.\nIt was the mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued.\nThe Sidonians long oppressed Israel.\nFrom the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its \"virgin daughter\", rose to its place of pre-eminence.\nSolomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Sidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the land of Israel.\nJezebel was the daughter of King Ithobaal I of Sidon.\nIt was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce.\nIt is frequently referred to by the prophets.\nElijah sojourned in Sidon, performing miracles.\n\nNew Testament\nJesus visited the region or \"coasts\" (King James Version) of Tyre and Sidon and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching, leading to the stark contrast in Matthew 11:21-23 to Korazin and Bethsaida. See the exorcism of the Syrophoenician woman's daughter, which takes place on the coast, in the region of Sidon and Tyre. Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went by way of Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis\nFrom Sidon, at which his ship put in after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for Rome.\n\nIn ancient mythology\nThe account ascribed to the Phoenician historian Sanchuniathon makes Sidon a daughter of Pontus, son of Nereus. She is said there to have first invented musical song from the sweetness of her voice.\n\nGallery\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nZugló, Hungary\n Constanța, Romania\n Sofia, Bulgaria\n Sochi, Russia\n\nNotable people\nIn antiquity and the pre-modern era\nChronological list.\n\nEumaeus, character from Greek mythology.

          "content": "طَرَابُلُس او طرابلس الشام هي مدينه لبنانيه عاصمه محافظه الشمال تكنى بالفيحاء. ثاني اكبر مدن لبنان بعد العاصمه بيروت. تاريخيًا نسب اليها اسم «طرابلس الشام» لتمييزها عن طرابلس الغرب، حيث كانت المدينه تابعه لما سمي بسوريه الكبرى ما قبل 1948.\nتقع طرابلس على بعد 85 كيلومتر الى الشمال من بيروت كما تبعد عن الحدود السوريه نحو 40 كيلو مترًا. يمتزج فيها الحاضر بالتاريخ. وعرفت طرابلس منذ القدم بموقعها الجغرافي المميز لانها صله الوصل ما بين الشاطئ الشرقي للبحر الابيض المتوسط والداخل السوري والعربي، مما جعلها مركزًا تجاريًا مهما على مستوى المنطقه ومنطقه الشمال.\nتضم المدينه عددًا كبيرًا من البنى التاريخيه والاثريه، ومتكامله باحيائها، واسواقها، ودورها، وازقتها المتعرجه الملتويه، والمسقوفه، ومعالمها، وتضم المدينه اكثر من 160 معلمًا، بين قلعه، وجامع، ومدرسه، وخان، وحمام، وسوق، وسبيل مياه، وكتابات، ونقوش، ورُنوك، وغيرها من المعالم التاريخيه والفنيه.\nتربض مدينه طرابلس العاصمه الثانيه للجمهوريه اللبنانيه فوق سهل، تغسل اطرافه الغربيه مياه البحر الابيض المتوسط، وتتفيا بظلال سفوح جبال الارز من جهه الشرق، ويشرف عليها من الشمال الشرقي جبل الفهود (تربل)، ويخترقها في الشرق نهر ابو علي المتدفق من الوادي المقدس قاديشا، وهو يفصل بين ربوتي (ابي سمراء)، و (قبه النصر).\nيعود تاريخ طرابلس الى ثلاثه 3500 عام، حيث اسسها الكنعانيون، وتعاقبت عليها الامم والعهود من الكنعانيين حتى الانتداب الفرنسي، مرورًا بالرومان، والبيزنطيين، والعرب، والفرنجه، والمماليك، والعثمانيين.\nتحاول المدينه في الوقت الحاضر تحريك عجلتها الاقتصاديه وتطوير اوجه الحياه المدنيه فيها. ويعتمد اقتصادها على الصناعات الحرفيه، وبعض الصناعات التحويليه الصغيره، والسياحه.\nتنقسم المدينه الى قسمين القسم الاول هو الميناء والقسم الثاني هو المدينه نفسها اضافه الى ضاحيتيها، البحصاص والبداوي، وشريطين ضيقين على امتداد شاطئ البحر، واحد باتجاه الشمال، والاخر باتجاه الجنوب، لتلامس مساحته 27 كيلومترا مربعا.\nيبلغ عدد سكان طرابلس (الكبرى) القاطنين فيها حوالي 850 الف نسمه تقريبًا، وتعتبر الكثافه السكانيه فيه الاعلى على الاطلاق حيث تصل الى 7086 شخصا في الكيلومتر الواحد.\nوفي مايو 2024 اختارت المنظمه العربيه للتربيه والثقافه والعلوم، اليكسو، مدينه طرابلس لتكون عاصمه الثقافه العربيه للعام 2024.\n\nاصل التسميه\nطرابلس هي تعريب لكلمه Τρίπολις) Tripolis) اليونانيه والتي تعني المدن الثلاث. ويعود الاسم حيث اسس على ارضها اول اتحاد من نوعه في عالم ذلك الزمان، لثلاث من مدن فينيقيا القديمه: صور وصيدا وارواد، نشات عنه مدينه فينيقيه بثلاثه احياء عمرانيه وهي «محلاتا» و«مايزا» و«كايزا». شكلت تلك المدينه فيما بعد باحيائها العمرانيه الثلاثه النواه الاساسيه التي قامت عليها طرابلس اليوم.\nكما عرفت المدينه باسماء مختلفه عبر العصور، ففي رسائل تل العمارنه سميت «دربلي». وفي اثار اخرى سميت «اهليه» او وهليه. وبمنحوتات انتصارات الغزو الاشوري للمدينه، سيمت «مهالاتا»، «مهلاتا»، «مايزا» و\"كايزا.\nبين القرنين السادس والرابع ق. م. ارتقى شان طرابلس بين المدن الفينيقيه حيث اصبحت عاصمه للاتحاد الفينيقي، واصبح اسمها (اثر – Athar)، وهذا ما كشفت عنه قطع النقود المسكوكه فيها بتاريخ 189 -188 ق. م. والتي صكت في العصر اليوناني ولكنها تحمل كتابه فينيقيه تدل على اسم طرابلس الفينيقي.\nدخلها اليونانيون في القرن الرابع قبل الميلاد، واطلقوا عليها اسم ” تريبوليس – Tripolis “اي المدينه المثلثه. وقد ظلت تحمل هذا الاسم طوال العصور التاريخيه التي تتالت عليها من الرومان حتى العرب الذين دخلوا عليها في القرن السابع الميلادي فعربوا الاسم الى اطرابلس باضافه الهمزه في اولها تمييزا لها عن طرابلس الغرب، ومن ثم حذفت الهمزه واصبحت طرابلس. ولقد سميت طرابلس ومنطقتها اماره طرابلس ثم دوله طرابلس ثم مملكه طرابلس المشرقيه.\nاما الصليبيون، فدعوها (تريبل) وجعلوها مركز مقاطعه طرابلس. لقبت «بالمدينه المقدسه» في النصف الاول من القرن الثاني الميلادي. كما دعيت ايام العرب بالفيحاء وما زالت هذه الصفه ملازمه لها حتى اليوم. وتسمى حاليا طرابلس الشام او طرابلس الشرق، تمييزًا لها عن طرابلس العاصمه الليبيه.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالمناخ\nمناخ طرابلس معتدل بفضل موقعها على البحر المتوسط، شتاؤها معتدل ماطر يمتد لحوالي 4 اشهر، وصيفها حار متوسط الرطوبه يمتد حوالي ال5 اشهر، اما الخريف والربيع فهما فصلان انتقاليان، وهما الاكثر جمالا وروعه حيث تستنشق المدينه رائحه ازهار الليمون المنتشره في البساتين.\nمعدل حرارتها السنوي 19,5 درجه مئويه، ادنى المعدل الشتوي 12,8 مئويه، واعلى المعدل الصيفي 25 مئويه.\nبين شواطئ طرابلس الدافئه، وجبالها العاليه، اقل من ساعه واحده تنقلنا من الصيف الى الشتاء، ومن التزلج على الماء الى التزلج على الثلج.\n\nالموقع\nتقع طرابلس على الساحل الشرقي للبحر الابيض المتوسط، وتربط المدن الساحليه بمدن سوريا الداخليه، وبالتالي بمدن العراق والخليج عن طريق ممر «طرابلس - حمص» الطبيعي الذي لعب دورا مهما عبر العصور. اما بيروت واللاذقيه فكلتاهما تفصلهما عن الداخل سلسله جبليه تعيق حركه النقل وخاصه اثناء الشتاء، لذلك تعتبر طرابلس منفذا لسوريا الداخليه والعراق والخليج العربي على البحر المتوسط.\nهي مركز محافظه لبنان الشمالي، والعاصمه الثانيه للبنان بعد بيروت التي تبعد عنها حوالي 85 كلم نحو الشمال، وتبعد عن الحدود اللبنانيه-السوريه الشماليه نحو 30 كلم، تبلغ مساحتها حوالي 15 كلم2، بما فيها الميناء. وتقع امام ساحلها مجموعه جزر صغيره اهمها: جزيره الرامكين وجزيره النخل وجزيره سنني. وقد اعلنت جميعها عام 1993 محميه طبيعيه بحريه تعرف باسم محميه جزر النخل. واقيمت مناره لهدايه السفن على الجزيره الاولى.\nتشرف طرابلس على سلسله جبليه ترتفع قممها الى ما فوق 3000 م تكسوها غابه الارز والثلوج الدائمه، وتنتشر على سفوح تلك السلسله المصايف ذات المناظر الخلابه، والمياه العذبه والهواء العليل.\nيخترق طرابلس نهر يتدفق من مغاره قاديشا في اعالي جبل المكمل، يعرف محليا ً بنهر ابو علي نسبه الى «ابو علي بن عمار» احد ولاتها من اسره بني عمار الذين حكموا طرابلس في نهايه القرن الحادي عشر الميلادي. يشطر نهر «ابو علي» طرابلس شطرين، شرقي وغربي، يصل بينهما الجسر الجديد الذي اقيم حديثا ً بعد طوفان النهر عام 1956، وهو يغذي تربتها ويروي بساتينها التي تغطي سهلها الخصيب.\n\nالمناطق\nضاحيتيها\nالبحصاص والبداوي، المهاتره الظاهريه (معروفه بالزاهريه). المئتين بالاضافه الى شريطين ضيقين على امتداد شاطئ البحر، واحد باتجاه الشمال، والاخر باتجاه الجنوب. وتدخل فيه القلمون\n\nتاريخ\nالعهد الفينيقي\nتؤكد المصادر التاريخيه والتنقيبات الاثريه ان طرابلس كانت احدى مدن الفينيقيين، حيث اسسوا فيها اول اتحاد لدويلات صيدا، وصور، وارواد، وبذلك يمكن اعتبار طرابلس اول اتحاد اممي في التاريخ .\n\nالعهد الاغريقي\nيتميز ساحل طرابلس بمجموعه من التشكيلات الجغرافيه التي يمكن استعمالها كموانئ للسفن والمراكب، ويتميز ايضًا بوجود مجموعه من الجزر، هي الوحيده في لبنان، وقد لعبت تلك الجزر دورًا هامًا في السيطره على الطرق العسكريه والتجاريه في المنطقه. ففي العصر الهيليني، وبالتحديد في ظل حكم خلفاء الاسكندر الاكبر، لعبت طرابلس دور قاعده بحريه كبيره وذات استقلاليه نسبيه.\n\nالعهد الروماني\nاما في العصر الروماني، بلغت المدينه اوج تطورها واحتوت على العديد من المعالم الهامه.\n\nالعهد البيزنطي\nودمرت طرابلس في العام 551 خلال العهد البيزنطي وذلك بفعل زلزال مدمر .\n\nالعهد الفاطمي\nعادت طرابلس للعب دور هام كقاعده عسكريه ابتداءً من العام 635 في عهدالامويين. وفي العصر الفاطمي، تميزت طرابلس بحكم ذاتي مستقل واصبحت مركزًا للعلم لا مثيل له في المنطقه. وفي بدايه القرن الثاني عشر، حوصرت طرابلس ثم سقطت بيد الافرنج الصليبيين في العام 1109.\nتضررت معظم معالم المدينه بشكل كبير، وبخاصه مكتبتها المعروفه باسم «دار العلم» والتي كانت تضم في كنفاتها ثلاثه ملايين مخطوط وكانت تنافس في غناها مكتبه بغداد.\n\nالعهد الصليبي\nالعهد المملوكي\nوفي العهد الصليبي، اصبحت مدينه طرابلس عاصمه كونتيه طرابلس. وفي العام 1289، فُتحت طرابلس على يد المنصور قلاوون سلطان مصر والشام الذي اعطى اوامره بهدم المدينه القديمه، والتي كانت تقع فيما يعرف حاضرًا باسم الميناء، وبنائها من جديد في السهل المنبسط تحت قلعه طرابلس. واتخذها سلاطين المماليك طوال قرنين وربع القرن من الزمان عاصمه لنيابه السلطنه، واقيمت فيها عشرات المساجد والمدارس، والزوايا، والتكايا، والخوانق، والربط، والحمامات، والخانات، والقياسر، والطواحين، ومن اشهر معالمها: الجامع المنصوري الكبير، وجامع التوبه، وجامع العطار، والبرطاسي، والسيد عبد الواحد المكناسي، وطينال، والمدرسه القرطاويه، والشمسيه، والنوريه، والناصريه، والخانوتيه، والسقرقيه، والطواشيه، والخيريه حُسْن، والعجميه، والحمصيه، والقادريه، والحججيه، والظاهريه، ومن خاناتها: خان الحريريين، والمصريين، والعسكر، والصاغه (الصابون)، والتماثيلي (بالميناء)، ومن حماماتها: حمام الحاجب، وعز الدين الموصلي، والنوري، والعطار، والدوادار، وغيره. واقيمت لها عده بوابات في مختلف الاتجاهات، وتشعبت حاراتها ودروبها وازقّتها الملتويه والممتدّه تحت عقود الدّور والمنازل التي توفّر لها حمايه ذاتيّه بحيث تحوّلت في معظمها الى سراديب ودهاليز وساباطات سريه لا يعرف السير فيها الا اهلها، بمعنى ان بناءها وخِططها كانت عسكريه دفاعيه حسب مقتضيات ذلك العصر، واقيم على امتداد ساحلها من راس الميناء الى راس النهر سته ابراج حربيه للمرابطه فيها، هي: برج الامير ايتمش، وبرج الامير جُلُبّان، وطرباي (الشيخ عفّان)، والامير الاحمدي (الفاخوره)، والامير برسباي (المعروف بالسباع)، وبرج السلطان قايتباي (المعروف ببرج راس النهر)، وللدفاع عن المدينه اذا دهمها العدو. كما جرى ترميم الحصن الذي اسسه «ابن مجيب الازدي»، واعاد بناءه «ريموند دي سان جيل»، وحوله نائب السلطنه «سيف الدين اسندمر الكرجي» الى قلعه كبيره.\n\nطرابلس العثمانيه\nدخلت طرابلس تحت السياده العثمانيه حين انتصر الاتراك على المماليك في مرج دابق سنه 922 هـ/ 1516 م. وابقوا على النظام المتبع فيها بتعيين الكُفّال والنواب لبضع سنوات، الى ان اصبحت تؤجر للاقطاعيين الذين ينيبون عنهم من يتولى حكمها وذلك اعتبارًا من سنه 928 هـ/ 1522 م.\n\nاوجد العثمانيون عده مناطق سكنيه جديده احاطت بمدينه المماليك، فازدادت عمرانًا واتساعًا، وتضاعف عدد مساجدها ومدارسها وزواياها وتكاياها وحماماتها وخاناتها، حتى بلغ ما فيها 44 خانًا، وتجاورت المساجد والمدارس، بل تلاصقت، وكثر عددها بشكل يثير العجب، حتى ان المدرسه كانت تفصلها عن المدرسه القريبه منها مدرسه اخرى مجاوره، وبلغ عددها قبل ثلاثمائه سنه ونيف اكثر من ثلاثمائه وستين مسجدًا ومدرسه، على عدد ايام السنه. ومن المعالم العثمانيه: تكيه الدراويش المولويه، وحمام العظم (الجديد)، وجامع محمود بك السنجق، وجامع محمود لطفي الزعيم (المعلق)، والجامع الحميدي، وسبيل الباشا الوزير محمد باشا، وسبيل الزاهد، والتكيه القادريه، وساعه التل. واعادوا بناء القلعه والابراج والحصون الساحليه والبوابات. واستعادت الميناء (طرابلس القديمه) دورها التجاري، فكثُرت فيها القنصليات الاوروبيه، واقيمت الوكالات والمخازن الضخام لاستيعاب المنتجات والبضائع الصادره والوارده من القطن، والسكر، والصابون، والقماش، والفواكه، والثمار، والعطور، والجلود، والحبوب، وغيره.يعتبر عهد الاتراك في طرابلس اطول العهود الاسلاميه التي خضعت لسيادتها، حيث امتد حكمهم نحو نيف واربعه قرون، باستثناء ثماني سنوات خضعت فيها للحكم المصري حين دخلها ابراهيم باشا ابن محمد علي الكبير سنه 1832 م. واتخذها قاعده عسكريه اثناء حملته على بلاد الشام واقام فيها. وعادت الى الاتراك العثمانيين بعد جلاء المصريين عنها سنه 1840 م. ثم خضعت للانتداب الفرنسي سنه 1918 م. فكانت «ساعه التل» اخر ما تركه العثمانيون من اثار في طرابلس.\n\nطرابلس المعاصره\nبقيت رائده المدن الساحليه حتى عام 1920، عندما اصبحت كغيرها من المدن الساحليه جزءًا من دوله لبنان الكبير.\nومع دوله الاستقلال 1943، اصبحت طرابلس العاصمه الثانيه بعد مدينه بيروت، واصبحت عاصمه محافظه لبنان الشمالي.\n\nالسكان\nيبلغ عدد سكان طرابلس الكبرى حوالي 850 الف نسمه، وتواجد في طرابلس طوائف عديده، من المسلمين؛ ويشكل المسلمون من اهل السنه والجماعه يشكّلون الغالبيه في المدينه.\n\nالتنقيبات الاثريه\nلم تجرِ في طرابلس ايّه اعمال تنقيب اثريه منظمه، وذلك لان معظم المناطق الاثريه القديمه تقع اسفل المنطقه المعروفه حاليًا باسم الميناء والمكسوه حاليًا بغطاء عمراني كثيف يشوّه الرؤيه.\nومكّنت بعض اعمال التنقيب الصغيره من الكشف عن بعض ثروات العهود القديمه منها الطريق الى المرفا البحري الجنوبي، وقصر نوفل، وبعض المدافن التي تعود الى العهد الهيليني.\nوكشفت اعمال التنقيب داخل قلعه طرابلس عن العديد من الاثار التي تعود الى العصر البرونزي، وعصر الحديد، وكذلك الى العهود الرومانيه، والبيزنطيه، والفاطميه.\n\nمعالم\nفاق عدد اثار طرابلس في اخر احصاء اجرته بلديتها منذ اكثر من عشر سنوات المئتي اثر. هذا العدد يجعلها موقعًا اثريًّا هامًا.\nتُعتبر طرابلس المدينه الاولى بثروتها التُراثيه على الساحل الشرقي للبحر المتوسط، وهي الثانيه باثارها المملوكيه بعد القاهره، وتمثل متحفًا حيًا يجمع بين الاوابد الرومانيه والبيزنطيه، والاثار الفاطميه والصليبيه، والعماره المملوكيه العثمانيه، وتعود اغلبيه هذه الاثار الى العهد المملوكي، يليه العهد العثماني فالعهد الصليبي والبيزنطي، ويقول المؤرخون ان مباني مدينه الميناء الحديثه قائمه على انقاض المدينه البيزنطيه.\n\nدور العباده\nالمساجد\nتُعرف مدينه طرابلس بكثره المساجد والتكايا والزوايا والمدارس الدينيه التي يعود بناؤها لايام المماليك والعثمانيين من بعدهم، حيث عماراتها المزخرفه وقناطرها المتناثره. ويوجد في طرابلس

اهميّه التجاره وخصوصًا الاهميّه الاقتصاديه لهذه المدينه مما يفسّر وجود هذا العدد الكبير من الخانات العائد معظمها الى العهد المملوكي.\nللخانات وظائف عديده فهي وبالاضافه الى كونها موقع لبيع وشراء البضائع، تستعمل ايضا\" لتخزين البضاعه وكمكان سكن التجار لانه يستلزمهم اكثر من يوم لبيع منتوجاتهم.\n\nخان الصابون المعروف ايضًا بخان العضيمي كان في البدايه يستعمل كثكنه عسكريه للجيش العثماني وتحول

وتحيط به طبقتان، خصصت السفلى منهما للبهائم والبضائع فيما خصصت العليا للنزلاء. وتطل هذه الغرف على الفناء من خلال اروقه معومده.\nومن خاناتها ايضًا: الصاغه، التماثيلي (بالميناء)، الخشب، والجاويش.\n\nالحمامات\nاثر في طرابلس الوجود التركي ومن اثاره وجود الحمامات العامه، والتي قامت في الاصل لحاجه النظافه والطهاره طبقا للشريعه الاسلاميه، بسبب قله المياه الواصله الى البيوت.\nومن حمامات المدينه:\n\nحمام النزهه الذي اتى عليه طوفان نهر ابو علي، حمام الطوافيه الذي لم يبق منه شيء، حمام القاضي الذي بُني عام 1340 وازيل لاحقًا، حمام العطار الذي لم يبق منه سوى واجهته الغربيه،\nحمام الداودار

العامه للاثار في لبنان، هو مفتوح حالياً للزياره.\nحمام العبد (قرب خان الصابون) الذي بني في اواخر القرن السابع عشر، وهو البناء الوحيد من نوعه الذي ما زال يعمل حتى اليوم ولا يزال صامدا في وجه كل الظروف حيث يستعيد فيه ابناء طرابلس ذكريات مجد غابر كان فيه الحمام التركي او الشرقي وسيله التسليه الوحيده في مجتمع متزمّت يرفض التجديد والتغيير.\n\nالقصور\nابرز قصور طرابلس هو قصر نوفل العثماني المعروف بمركز «رشيد كرامي الثقافي البلدي» بعد ان حولته بلديه المدينه الى مكتبه عامه وقاعه محاضرات ومعارض.\nوهناك ايضًا قصرُ الامير المملوكي سَنْجَر الحمصي الذي سكنه عام 1324 م، وقصر الامير المملوكي سيف الدين اَلْطُنْطاش من القرن 13 م.\nوقصر الامير عز الدين ايبك الموصلي وهو من عصر المماليك، به زخارف اندلسيه شبيهه بقصر الحمراء في غَرْناطه، وبعد القصر ضريح الامير، وفوق نافذته اللوحه التاريخيه العائده الى العام 1299 م.\nوهكذا\n\nالبرك\nعشرات البِرَك وسُبُل المياه منتشره في اسواق المدينه القديمه، وتتميز بها عن غيرها من المدن ومنها بركه الملاحه التي كانت تُملا في الاعياد بانواع الشراب، من عصير البرتقال، او التمر هندي، او الليمون، او السوس، ويشرب منها الناس مجانًا لمده ثلاثه ايام، واحيانًا لمده اسبوع كامل.\nوسبيل ماء مملوكي يعرف بـسبيل التينه، بناه الامير محمد بن مباركشاه العلائي في العام 1414 م. وفي داخله لوحه تاريخيه.\n\nالابراج والقلاع\nتشعّبت حارات طرابلس ودروبها وازقّتها الملتويه تحت عقود الدّور والمنازل التي توفّر لها حمايه ذاتيّه بحيث تحوّلت في معظمها الى سراديب ودهاليز وساباطات سريّه لا يعرف السيّر فيها الاّ اهلها، بمعنى ان بناءها\nوخِططها كانت عسكريه دفاعيه، واقيم على امتداد ساحلها سته ابراج حربيه للمرابطه فيها والدفاع اذا دهمها العدو وهي:\n\nبرج الامير ايتمش،\nبرج الامير جُلُبّان،\nطرباي (الشيخ عفّان)،\nالامير الاحمدي (الفاخوره)،\nالامير برسباي (المعروف بالسباع)،\nوبرج السلطان قايتباي (المعروف ببرج راس النهر)، ّ.\nاما قلعه طرابلس فهي اكبر القلاع الحربيه في لبنان واقدمها، اسسها القائد العربي سفيان بن مجيب الازدي في العام 636 م. وبنى فيها الفاطميون مسجدًا اوائل القرن 11 م\nوبنى القائد التولوزي ريموند دي سان جيل حصنًا فوقها عام 1103 م. ثم حوله الامير المملوكي اسَتُدَمُر الكُرْجي عام 1307 م الى قلعه وبنى بها ابراجاَ، ثم اضاف السلطان العثماني سليمان بن سليم الاول عام 1521 م البرج الشمالي وفيه باب القلعه.\n\nتقع القلعه فوق تلهٍ صخريه وتتالف من 4 طبقات، بها حمام قديم و3 مساجد، وسجن، واسطبل للخيول، وقاعات للقاده وكبار المسؤولين، وقاعات ضخمه للجند والذخيره والمدفعيه وابار وخزانات للمياه، واحواض للشرب، ومقابر، وباحات واسعه للتدريبات العسكريه والاستعراض،

الاساسيه لدخول البضائع الى منطقه الشرق الاوسط وعرف تاريخيًا بهذه الاهميه لقربه من الداخل السوري من دون عقبات جغرافيه.\nالى ذلك يعد هذا المرفا احد اهم بوابات تنشيط الحركه الاقتصاديه في مدينه طرابلس وعموم الشمال وهو يشهد حاليا ورشه عمل متواصله لتطويره، منها: انشاء رصيف جديد مع منطقه خلفيه تم اعتمادها كمنطقه اقتصاديه حــره، وتعميق حوض وتنفيذ اعمال الصيانه للعنابر ومنشات المرفا.\nونظرًا الى تطور بعض انواع التجاره في المنطقه والتي تمتد على فترات طويله ماضيه فان استيراد الاخشاب والاسمده الى لبنان اصبح من اختصاص مرفا طرابلس بشكلٍ عام.\nيشار الى ان عدد الارصفه الحالي في المرفا هو 7 وتقع بجانب احواض مائيه.\n\nالحرف\nالحلويات\nكما تشتهر مدينه طرابلس بغنى اثارها وكثره مساجدها والتكايا والزوايا فيها هي ايضًا تشتهر بصناعه الحلويات التي ذاع صيتها في كل ارجاء الوطن وتعدى الحدود والجغرافيا حتى اضحت الحلويات ملازمه لعراقه طرابلس واصالتها الموصوله عبر تاريخها القديم العابق بالتراث.\nومن ابرز الانواع التي تعرف بها المدينه: الفيصليه، تاج الملك، الكلاج، حلاوه الجبن، ميرامار، بقلاوه، برمه، عش البلبل، كول وشكور، بسمه، وبصمه، حلاوه الشميسه، بلوريه، اضافه الى انواع الكنافه والفروكه.\nاقترن اسم طرابلس بالحلويات عبر تاريخها وما زالت محافظه عليه امانه لا ترد تتوارثه جيلًا من جيل وتماشيًا مع سياسه الانفتاح الدائم على التطور والافاق الجديده.\nصناعه الحلويات الطرابلسيه التي ازدهرت منذ نحو القرنين من الزمن افــرزت اسماء عائلات عديده استثمرت في هذا المجال، ابرزها عائله الحلاب التي ارتبط اسمها بالحلويات الشرقيه. وتحولت هــذه الحرفه على ايدي افراد العائله الى صناعه متكامله وماركه تجاريه امتدت شهرتها خــارج المدينه والوطن وعبر القارات.\nو امتازت ايضا في نفس المجال حلويات التوم من خلال عائله التوم التي اشتهرت تاريخيا بالتجاره وصناعه الحلويات العربيه بنكهه طرابلسيه اصيله ويحتفظ ابناء العائله من جيل الى جيل باسرار المهنه والصنعه ويشرفون على الانتاج وتتجلى اسرارهم في حلاوه الجبن خاصه التي صارت ارثا «ثقافيا» بالعائله وبالمدينه، وقد تاسست في طرابلس القديمه سنه 1919 م على يدي مؤسس وعميد المهنه والصنعه عبد السلام التوم، وفرعها الرئيسي الاثري يقع جانب مسجد التوبه الاثري مقابل خان العسكر التاريخي والاثري.\n\nالتعليم\nفي مجال التربيه والتعليم تضم طرابلس وضواحيها عددًا كبيرًا من المدارس من مختلف المستويات، حكوميه وخاصه. كذلك توجد في طرابلس وضواحيها عده جامعات. وفي ما يلي الجامعات

ومهرجانات الشارع والحدائق، بهدف تعزيز الحركه السياحيه في طرابلس، ووضع المدينه على الخارطه السياحيه اللبنانيه جديًا.\nوعوده المهرجانات هذه ترافقه مع تقدم نوعي في العمل حيث باتت تدار وتنظم بــمـشاركه محليه واسعه سمحت بالاستغناء عــن استقدام اداريــيــن ومنظمين من خارج المدينه.\nوتضمن برنامج المهرجانات حفلات متنوعه منها: الفنانه نجوى كرم والفنان وليد توفيق وفرقه الباليه البيلاروسيه وفرقه «قونيا»

          "content": "The Citadel of Tripoli (Arabic: قَلْعَة طَرَابُلُس ALA-LC: Qalʻat Ṭarābulus) is a 12th-century fortress in Tripoli, Lebanon. It was built at the top of a hill \"during the initial Frankish siege of the city between 1102 and 1109\" on the orders of Raymond de Saint-Gilles, who baptized it the Castle of Mount Pilgrim (French: château du Mont-Pèlerin; Latin: castellum Montis Peregrini) while local Muslims have been referring to it as the Castle of Saint-Gilles (Arabic: قَلْعَة سَان جِيل Qalʻat Sān Jīl). \nHowever, very little of the original structure has survived, the castle having been rebuilt several times, and for the last time in the early 19th century, when the citadel was extensively restored and rebuilt by the Ottoman governor of Tripoli Mustafa Agha Barbar. The citadel nowadays houses the North Lebanon & Akkar Museum.\n\nHistory\nThe first cornerstone was set in the 9th century during the conquest of Tripoli by Sufyan al-azadi, it was a fort 2 miles away from the old city on a strategic hill. The fort was gradually fortified and rebuilt with time by many succeeding rulers. In the citadel there are many clues of past nations including the remains of a Fatimid mosque.\nThe citadel was built on the orders of Raymond of Saint-Gilles during the siege of Tripoli. The hill where the citadel stands had previously been the site of an 11th-century Shi'i cemetery, which the crusaders destroyed. When the Mont Pèlerin quarter was set ablaze by the Mamluks after the reconquest, the castle of Saint-Gilles suffered and stood abandoned on the hilltop for the next eighteen years. It was essential to have an adequate stronghold in Tripoli for the sultan's troops, temporarily garrisoned in Hisn al-Akrad (Krak des Chevaliers), as the distance was too great in case of enemy attack.\nAbu'l-Fida and Ibn al-Wardi record that, among the important events which took place in 1345, was the promulgation of a military decree which was set up by order of the Mamluk Sultan al-Kamil Sha'ban in the citadels of Aleppo, Tripoli, Hisn al-Akrâd and other fortified places. The decree, put over the second entrance way of the citadel of Tripoli, is by far the best preserved. Apparently this sultan, who lived a life of luxury and debauchery, was in constant need of extra revenue. In order to fill his depleted treasury, he imposed a heavy registration tax upon all feudal land concessions and appropriations. This tax was unpopular and was obviously going to stir up discontent among his subjects. To forestall any uprising and gain the support of his troops, upon whom his power was based he issued this military decree. It was the custom that a Mamluk soldier, under contract for a specified number of years, received an annual gratuity which amounted to slightly over eleven days extra pay. If the soldier died before the end of his contract, the sultan had the right to claim the extra sum of money which had accumulated during the soldier's years of service. Sha'bán abandoned his rights to this claim, once and for all, hoping thus to enlist the support of his troops.\nIn 1516, Syria and Egypt fell to the Ottoman Sultan Selim I. His son and successor Suleiman I, called the Magnificent (1520-1566), soon after his accession made an inspection tour of his newly-conquered lands. He gathered about him in Damascus all his provincial governors and on this occasion took the decision to rebuild the citadel of Tripoli.\nIn the years that followed, various Ottoman governors of Tripoli did restoration work on the citadel to suit their needs and with time the medieval crenelated battlements were destroyed in order to open sally ports for cannons. \nVery little of the original Crusader structure has survived until this day. The graves of a number of nameless Frankish knights, here and there, are the only bits of evidence today evocative of their presence on the heights of Tripoli's \"Pilgrim's Mountain\" many centuries ago.\n\nNorth Lebanon & Akkar Museum\nThe citadel houses the North Lebanon & Akkar Museum. The small museum has a numismatic collection covering most periods from the Hellenic to the Ayyubid one.\n\nTripoli landmark map\nSee also\nArchitecture of Lebanon\nList of Crusader castles\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n\"The Tripoli Citadel\" on tripoli-lebanon.org",

This ancient Phoenician city has been of great religious, political and commercial value; it is said to be inhabited since 4000 B.C. In AD 1228, the Crusaders built Sidon's Sea Castle as a fortress on a small island connected to the mainland by a narrow 80m long roadway. The island was formerly the site of a temple to Melqart, the Phoenician version of Heracles. The beauty of the Castle can be seen in old illustrations of it; however, after bearing several wars, it has been damaged and renovated several times. It was partially destroyed by the Mamluks when they took over the city from the Crusaders, but they subsequently rebuilt it and added the long causeway. The castle later fell into disuse, but was again restored in the 17th century by Emir Fakhreddine II, only to suffer great damage.\nThere is a possibility that the island on which the castle is built was, in fact, the location of the Phoenician King's palace and several other Phoenician monuments which were destroyed by Esarhaddon and then by natural earthquakes. This island has also served as a shelter from inside attacks on the city. Great Sidon, Little Sidon, powerful fortresses, pastures, cisterns and fortifications are all mentioned in the Assyrian king Sennacherib's recordings of his attacks on Sidon and nearby cities.\n\nDescription\nToday, the castle consists primarily of two towers connected by a wall. In the outer walls, Roman columns were used as horizontal reinforcements, a feature often seen in fortifications built on or near former Roman sites. The rectangular west tower to the left of the entrance is the better preserved of the two. There is a large vaulted room scattered with old carved capitals and rusting cannonballs. A winding staircase leads up to the roof, where there is a small, domed Ottoman-era mosque. From the roof, there is a view across the old city and fishing harbor. The east tower is not as well preserved and was built in two phases; the lower part dates to the Crusader period, while the upper level was built by the Mamluks. There has also been evidence of the old Phoenician city being buried under the sea in the area surrounding the castle: structures of walls, columns, stairways, remains of buildings, statues and cisterns.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of Crusader castles\nList of Lebanese monuments\nLordship of Sidon\n\nReferences\nSidon (Pamphlet), Ministry of Tourism of Lebanon, Arab Printing Press, 2009\nSea Castle.

After 1840, the palace was used by the Ottomans as a government building. During the French Mandate it served as a local administrative office.\nIn 1943, the palace was declared the president's official summer residence. During the Lebanese Civil War it was heavily damaged. Parts of the palace are today open to the public while the rest is still the president's summer residence.\nA gathering of troops here for an incursion into Syria under Ibrahim Pasha is recorded in the notes to Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poetical illustration  The Gathering of the Chieftains at Beteddein. to an engraving of a painting (showing the palace) by William Henry Bartlett in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1839.\nUNESCO gave the palace enhanced protection during the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon to safeguard against damage; it was one of 34 cultural sites to receive enhanced protection.\n\nDescription\nThe Beiteddine Palace is recognized as a fine illustration of Lebanese architecture from the early 19th century, with notable Italian influences.\nThe palace's main entrance leads to a 107x45 meter courtyard. Along the right side of this court is a two-story wing, Al-Madafa, which was once used for receiving guests.\nThe entrance to the central section of the palace, Dar El Wousta, is from a double stairway at the far western end of the courtyard. From this point on, the impressive but austere appearance of the outside court and buildings gives way to the delightful architecture featuring beautiful arcades, mandaloun balconies, fountains, facades, rooms with carved and painted cedar wood embellished with Arabic calligraphy, antique furniture, inlaid marble and fine mosaics. These rooms served as offices and receptions salons.\nAt the far end of this courtyard rise the private apartments, Dar el Harim, composed of a large and richly decorated façade, the Upper Harem, the selamlik, the Lower Harem and the kitchens.\nAt the northern edge of the Dar El Harim section is the hammam.\nBeyond the hammam is the tree-shaded tomb of Emir Bashir Shehab II and his first wife.\n\nGallery",

Moussa's castle was built on a hill between Deir El Kamar and Beiteddine - Lebanon, with the beliefs and ideas of its builder engraved on its stones. The castle was built by Moussa Abdel Karim Al Maamari who was born on July 27, 1931, in the village of Harat Al Saraya - Lebanon and died January 31, 2018, in the village Deir El Qamar. His idea of building a castle began when he was only 14 years old, inspired by the Middle Ages.\nRidiculed by his teacher \"Anwar\" and mocked by his classmates, he left school and travelled to Saida on foot where he worked with his uncle on restoring Saida's fortress. He was later assigned by the Emir Maurice Chehab to renovate the castles and to excavate for archaeological discoveries to be exhibited in the National Museum of Beirut in 1947. He continued working in the same field gaining enough experience from his work in restoring castles. He was then transferred to Beiteddine palace, where he restored the museum of Emir Bashir Chehabi II; he supervised the work as well as the placing of the Emir's weapons collection, clothes and jewelry, and the sword offered to him by Napoleon in the museum that was inaugurated under the rule of late president Beshara Khalil Al Khoury in September 1951. It was then that he began work on his own construction and bought a suitable piece of land. The foundation stone was laid in 1962, and completed with the help of his wife.\n\nSee also\nMoussa Al-Maamari\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nMoussa Castle official website",

          "content": "The Jeita Grotto (Arabic: مغارة جعيتا) is a system of two separate, but interconnected, karstic limestone caves spanning an overall length of nearly 9 kilometres (5.6 mi). The caves are situated in the Nahr al-Kalb river valley within the locality of Jeita, 18 kilometres (11 mi) north of the Lebanese capital Beirut. Though inhabited in prehistoric times, the lower cave was not rediscovered until 1836 by Reverend William Thomson; it can only be visited by boat since it channels an underground river that provides fresh drinking water to more than a million Lebanese. On October 31, 2025, the caves were illegally used as a wedding venue by a Lebanese-Italian couple, prompting national outrage and the prime minister to order the opening of an investigation.\nIn 1958, Lebanese speleologists George Farra and Sami Karkabi discovered the upper galleries 60 metres (200 ft) above the lower cave which have been accommodated with an access tunnel and a series of walkways to enable tourists safe access without disturbing the natural landscape. The upper galleries house the world's largest known stalactite.  The galleries are composed of a series of chambers the largest of which peaks at a height of 12 metres (39 ft).\n\nLocation\nThe Jeita cave is situated at the center of the western flanks of the Lebanon mountains, more specifically in the Nahr al-Kalb valley, its natural entrance is about 100 metres (330 ft) above sea level. It's located 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) east of the Mediterranean coastline and 18 kilometres (11 mi) north of Beirut within the confines of the municipality of Jeita, in the caza of Keserwan.\n\nHistory\nAncient vestiges of a foundry were found in a smaller cave near the Nahr al-Kalb river, suggesting that the cave was used in antiquity to produce swords.\nThe modern discovery of the underground river of Jeita in 1836 is credited to Reverend William Thomson (an American missionary) who ventured some 50 metres (160 ft) into the cave. Reaching the underground river, he fired a shot from his gun and the resulting echoes convinced him that he had found a cavern of major importance.\nIn 1873 W.J. Maxwell and H.G. Huxley, engineers with the Beirut Water Company, and their friend Reverend Daniel Bliss, president of the Syrian Protestant College (later the American University of Beirut) explored these caverns. In two expeditions carried out in 1873 and 1874, they penetrated 1,060 metres (3,480 ft) into the grotto before finding their progress blocked by an underground waterfall. The waterfall became known as \"Hell's Rapids\", as the torrents break onto razor sharp rocks. Dr. Bliss, Mr. Maxwell, and the other engineers recorded their names and the year on \"Maxwell's Column\", a great limestone pillar some 625 metres (2,051 ft) from the entrance. About 200 metres (660 ft) further on, in the so-called \"Pantheon\", they wrote their names and details of the expedition on paper, sealed it in a bottle and placed it on top of a stalagmite. The lime-impregnated water has since covered the bottle with a thin white film, permanently fixing it to the stone.\nBetween 1892 and 1940 further expeditions were carried out by English, American, and French explorers. Their expeditions brought them to a depth of 1,750 metres (5,740 ft).\nSince the 1940s, Lebanese explorers have pushed even deeper into the Jeita grotto. Many of these spelunkers are members of the Speleo Club du Liban (Lebanese Caving Club) founded in 1951 by the first Lebanese speleologists Lionel Ghorra, Albert Anavi, Raymond Khawam and Sami Karkabi. Their expeditions revealed a great underground system which is now explored to an overall length of nearly 9 kilometres (5.6 mi).\nIn 1958 the lower caverns were opened to the public, meanwhile exploration was still underway mainly by the Lebanese Caving Club.  This exploration led to the discovery of the elevated dry branch of the grotto later referred to as the upper galleries.\nIn 1962, the Spéléo Club contributed to a study of the upper galleries aiming to provide an access tunnel which was to be dug for touristic development purposes. Work on the access tunnel was begun in 1968.  Its opening was followed by the installation of a  series of walkways which permitted tourists safe access to the upper galleries without disturbing the natural landscape.\n\nIn 1969, a concert with electronic music by the French composer Francois Bayle was held in the cave to celebrate the inauguration of the upper galleries. This event was organized by the Lebanese artist and sculptor Ghassan Klink. Other cultural events have taken place in this unusual surrounding, including a concert by the world acknowledged German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen in November 1969, and more recently, in 2008 a classical music concert by Lebanese-Armenian composer and pianist Guy Manoukian.\nThe caverns closed to the public due to the Lebanese civil war in 1978; both tunnels leading to the lower and upper galleries were used to store munitions, and the outside buildings for military purposes. The caves reopened in 1995 and remain one of the country's key natural attractions. The caverns were closed on early November 2025 due to an unauthorized wedding that took place there, but were reopened on November 15, as experts claim no harm was caused to the caves.\n\nArchaeology\nJeita I (sometimes referred to as Nahr-el-Kelb) is a dry cave, 56 metres deep to the east of the source cave from where the river flows and connected to it by narrow channels. It was first noted in 1833 by Botta and excavated by Godefroy Zumoffen in two positions in 1898, 1900, 1908 and 1910. It was later excavated by Auguste Bergy with materials from both excavations now with the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory, the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut, and the private collection of Dr. Gigues. Henri Fleisch noticed an Upper Paleolithic level with further finds including polished Neolithic pieces, primitive potsherds, burned bones, and end scrapers. Jacques Cauvin noted similarities in these finds to the Néolithique Moyen period of Byblos. Evidence of later occupation included a Chalcolithic tripod pot found by Father Fleisch and a combed-ware sherd suggested to date to the Early Bronze Age levels at Byblos.\nJeita II (Dahr el-Mghara) is a rock shelter situated on a platform, above and equidistant between the dry cave of Jeita I and the entrance to the grotto at Jeita III. Excavations were made by the Duc de Luynes and Lartet in 1864, by Zumoffen in 1900 and 1908 and by Bergy in 1930. A large number of flint tools, bones, and hearths were found that were accredited to the Aurignacian. Further excavations were made in 1964 by Francis Hours which revealed much more extensive, deeper and richer deposits than had previously been suspected. Father Hours permitted Lorraine Copeland to disclose that the upper material appeared to display late Upper Paleolithic or early Mesolithic characteristics, probably including Kebaran. Excavation was to be continued but the area was fenced off and owned by the government.\nJeita III (The Caverns) was a deposit of brown soil that fell from a location suggested to be at the east end of Jeita II, just inside the entrance to the grotto where the tourists are conducted by boat. It was found in 1963 by the Speleologists Club and excavated by Father Hours. Flint tools found in the deposit were geometric in design and suggested to be a form of Natufian or later Mesolithic than discovered at Jeita II, from where it may have been displaced. Forms of these flints included rectangles with straight or oblique truncation, borers of the \"crochet\" type, micro-burins, end scrapers, bladelet cores, two transverse arrowheads, crescents, and short triangles. Some of the crescents had ridged backs and resembled those found at Nahal Oren. Material is stored with the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory.\nJeita IV (Mugharet-el-Mal) is a rock shelter in the cliff upstream from the grotto. It once contained a large quantity of Paleolithic material which has been looted and was deemed unfit for excavation by Sami Karkaby, Director of the Caverns in 1965. Study of the lithic remains at this shelter were hoped to shed further light on the Paleolithic or Mesolithic communities that inhabited the different sites at different times.\n\nGeology\nThe Jeita grotto is located within the Lower-Middle Jurassic strata of Keserouane which has a stratigraphic thickness of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) and consists of dolomite and micritic limestone. The Keserouane formation was exposed to air by a local uplift during  the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. The Keserouane strata became karstified after its aerial exposure and then was buried during the Cretaceous. In the Neogene, upon the final uplift of Mount Lebanon, this early karstification phase was reactivated.\nAt the Nahr al-Kalb valley, the impervious Upper Jurassic volcanic rocks and Lower Cretaceous sand slant almost vertically forming a hydrogeological barrier and forcing the outlet of the Jeita underground river to the surface. This barrier could be the reason for the westernmost, large cave chambers with heights exceeding 60 metres (200 ft). Karstification of the Keserouane limestone was further intensified by the steep topography of the area and the volume of precipitation over the Lebanon (more than 1200mm).\nA ratio of total slope gradient of 1/100 is calculated between the entrance of the cave and its inland extremity. This shows its smooth flat course even though it is sometimes interrupted by several small cascades and rapids. From the west, the Jeita cave starts with large halls and meanders. Through some rapids, the dimension becomes narrower. Going forth, it is spacious with the Thompson's cavern (250 metres (820 ft) long and 60 metres (200 ft) wide), Grand Chaos (500 metres (1,600 ft) long) and Mroueh's Hall (200 metres (660 ft) long and 50 metres (160 ft) wide). The latter two are floored with collapsed blocks. The cave ends with a Y-shaped pattern, where, each branch ends with a siphon.\n\nDescription\nThe Jeita caves are solutional karst caves which have formed over millions of years due to the dissolution of limestone. The limestone is dissolved by carbonic acid charged rain water and groundwater; when the limestone, which is originally waterproof, contains cracks produced by tectonic forces the water oozes into the rock and starts to widen the cracks and solute caves inside the layers. Jeita is the longest cave complex in the Middle East; it sits at 300 metres (980 ft) above sea level and has a height difference of 305 metres (1,001 ft).  Geologically, the caves provide a tunnel or escape route for the underground river, which is the principal source of Nahr al-Kalb.\nThe Jeita grotto is the longest explored cave in Lebanon. After many years of exploration, speleologists have penetrated about 6,200 metres (20,300 ft) from the entry point of the lower grotto to the far end of the underground river and about 2,130 metres (6,990 ft) of the upper galleries.\n\nUpper cave\nThe Jeita upper cave has an overall length of 2,130 metres (6,990 ft) of which only 750 metres (2,460 ft) are accessible to visitors via a specially conceived walkway; access to the remainder of the cave was restricted to prevent ecological damage which may occur due to the flocking tourists. The upper cave contains a great concentration of a variety of crystallized formations such as stalactites, stalagmites, columns, mushrooms, ponds, curtains, and draperies. The upper gallery is famous for its formations, lit by an effective lighting system. It is entered through a 117 metres (384 ft) long concrete tunnel. The part accessible by visitors has three huge chambers. The first is called the White Chamber, the second Red Chamber.\nWhite dripstones are pure calcite without defilement, the red color is given by iron oxide (rust) in small amounts. In Lebanon, iron oxide has a red color instead of the brown beige color which is common in northern countries. The reason is a different chemical reaction caused by the high temperature which produces a different kind of iron oxide.\nThe White Chamber is medium-sized, but has the most impressive formations of the cave. The Red Chamber is up to 106 metres (348 ft) high, and 30 metres (98 ft) to 50 metres (160 ft) wide. The third chamber is the biggest of all three chambers and has a height of more than 120 metres (390 ft). The longest stalactite in the world is located in Jeita's White Chamber; it measures 8.2 metres (27 ft) long.\n\nLower cave\nThe lower gallery which has an overall length of 6,200 metres (20,300 ft) is located 60 metres (200 ft) below the upper gallery. It is traversed by a smooth underwater river and a lake (the \"Dark Lake\"). The river is broken up by several small cataracts and rapids. The lower cave's \"Thompson's Cavern\", is a massive hall with impressive speleothems such as the Eagle Obelisk stalagmite. Other halls in the lower gallery include the Pantheon, Grand Chaos and Shangri-la. Visitors are transported in the lower gallery by electric boats for a distance of 500 metres (1,600 ft). In winter the lower level is closed, when the water level is too high.\n\nEconomic and social importance\nToday, the Jeita Grotto is a popular recreational show cave and a major tourist attraction. It hosts approximately 280,000 visitors per year.\nThe Jeita grotto contributes heavily to the public life of the region. MAPAS, the firm which runs the grotto, is an important employer and provides full-time jobs for around 115 local residents of Jeita (30% of which are female). In addition to employment, the Jeita caves contribute 5% of ticket fees to the local municipality, between 10 and 20% of general revenue to the Lebanese ministry of tourism, and an additional 10% of ticket fees along with the 10% VAT to the Lebanese ministry of Finance.\nMoreover, the Jeita cave emits a spring with a flow ranging from 1–2 m3/s, providing fresh drinking water for one-and-a-half million inhabitants of the capital, Beirut. However, water pollution, due to domestic and agricultural runoff, remains a serious concern as recent analysis detected an increasing presence of coliform bacteria.\n\nAwards\nIn 2002, then French President Jacques Chirac, the United Nations World Tourism Organization and the World Bank accorded the top Sustainable Development in Tourism prize to MAPAS (the company that manages the site) at a summit dubbed “New Ties between Tourism and Culture” in Geneva.\nIn December 2003, on behalf of the Beirut-based private company MAPAS, Jeita received a prestigious award from the fifth Tourism Summits in Chamonix, France. \"Les sommets du tourisme\" recognized MAPAS’ efforts in restoring Lebanon's important touristic sites.\nThe Jeita Grotto was a candidate for the New 7 Wonders of Nature competition. It was selected as one of 28 finalists and is the only cave to be selected among the nominees. The New7Wonders Foundation announced the new wonders of nature in 2011. Jeita was not on the list.\nOther awards and certificates include:\n\n2000 Certificate of Recognition from \"Sukleen\"-Lebanon for its sorting and recycling campaign.\n2000 Appreciation from the Arab Musical Association\".\n1998 \"Best Tourism Project\" from the Lebanese Ministry of Tourism.\n1997 International Environmental Award from the German Travel Association (DRV).\n\nOther names\nThe name of the cave changed several times since its discovery. Initially referred to as the Grottos of Nahr al-Kalb, it was subsequently known as Djaita, Jehita, and finally Jeita. Nahr al-Kalb is the name of the river that runs through the grottoes, while  Jeita, meaning \"roaring water\" in Aramaic, is the town in which the cave's entrance is located. The transition from Grottoes of Nahr al-Kalb to Jeita Grottoes occurred in 1927 as newspapers widely used the latter name.\n\nNumismatics and philately\nIn 1961, Jeita became a national symbol when Lebanese authorities issued a stamp featuring the lower cavern to promote national tourism. Mr. Maroun Hajj, the oarsman shown on the stamp, still leads boat tours forty years after the stamp was issued. The Jeita Grotto is also featured on the 1964 one Lira (Lebanese pound) verso.\n\nPopular culture\nSeveral scenes of the 1977 Hindi film Chandi Sona (starring Sanjay Khan and Parveen Babi) were shot at the site.\n\nSee also\nList of Lebanese monuments\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nJeita Grotto website \n360 HD Panoramas of Jeita Grotto\n360 Jeita grotto, the lower cave\nJeita Grotto at Beautiful World",

          "content": "Kadisha Valley (Arabic: وادي قاديشا / وادي قديشا, romanized: Wādi Qadīšā / Wādi Qādīšā), also romanized as the Qadisha Valley and also known as the Kadisha Gorge or Wadi Kadisha (French: Ouadi Qadisha), is a gorge that lies within the Bsharri and Zgharta Districts of the North Governorate of Lebanon. The valley was carved by the Kadisha River, also known as the Nahr Abu Ali when it reaches Tripoli. Kadisha means \"Holy\" in Aramaic, and the valley is sometimes called the Holy Valley. It has sheltered Christian monastic communities for many centuries. The valley is located at the foot of Mount al-Makmal in northern Lebanon.\nThe valley is at risk due to the encroachment of human settlement, illegal building, and inconsistent conservation activity. Although it is not on the UNESCO \"in danger\" list, there have been warnings that continued violations may lead to this step.\n\nGeography\nThe holy river, Nahr Qadisha, runs through the valley for 35 km from its source in a cave (grotto) a little way below the Forest of the Cedars of God. The sides of the valley are steep cliffs that contain many caves, often at more than 1,000 m and all difficult of access. The most scenic section of the valley stretches for approximately 20 km between Bsharri (Arabic: بشري), the hometown of Kahlil Gibran, and Tourza (Arabic: طورزا).\n\nCedars of God\nKadisha Valley lies west of the Forest of the Cedars of God, (situated on the mountain above), survivors of the ancient Cedars of Lebanon, the most highly prized building materials of the ancient world. The forest is said to contain 375 individual trees, two claimed to be over 3,000 years old, ten over 1,000 years old, and the remainder at least centuries old. The Lebanon Cedar (Cedrus Libani) is described in ancient works on botany as the oldest tree in the world. It was admired by the Israelites, who brought it to their land to build the First and the Second temples in Jerusalem. Historical sources report that the  cedar forests were beginning to disappear at the time of Justinian in the 6th century AD.\n\nHistory\nQadisha Valley's natural caves have been used as shelters and for burials since the Palaeolithic period. The Aassi Hauqqa (cave) in particular, near Hawqa, has yielded archaeological items indicating use in the Palaeolithic, Roman, and medieval periods. Since the early days of Christianity the valley has served as a refuge for those in search of solitude. The Maronite monks established their new center at Qannubin, in the heart of the Qadisha, and monasteries quickly spread over the surrounding hills. Early Maronite settlement in the valley combined both community and eremitic life.\nThe Mameluk sultans Baibars and Qalaoun led campaigns in 1268 and 1283, respectively, against the fortress-caves, monasteries, and the surrounding villages. Despite these attacks, the Deir Qannubin monastery was to become the seat of the Maronite Patriarch in the 15th century and remained so for 500 years. In the 17th century, the Maronite monks’ reputation for piety was promoted through the Maronite school founded in Rome in 1584. by dint of this exposure, many European poets, historians, geographers, politicians, and clergy visited and even settled in the Valley. The first printing press in the Middle East was founded in 1585 at the Monastery of Qozhaya in the Kadisha Valley, and in 1610 printed its first book, the Book of Psalms in the Syriac language. It used Syriac characters. Also this printing press was the first to print in Arabic language\n\nQadisha mummies\nEight well preserved natural mummies of villagers dating back to around 1283 A.D. were uncovered by Fadi Baroudy, Pierre Abi Aoun, Paul Kahawaja & Antoine Ghaouch, a team of speleologists from the GERSL scientific organisation in the Qadisha Valley between 1989 and 1991. These were found in the 'Asi-al Hadath cave along with a wealth of artifacts.\n\nWorld Heritage Site\nIn 1998, UNESCO added the valley to the list of World Heritage Sites because of its importance as the site of some of the earliest Christian monastic settlements in the world, and its continued example of Christian faith.\n\nChristian monasticism\nThe Kadisha (Holy) Valley is the site of some of the most ancient Christian monastic communities of the Middle East. The valley's natural caves, being comfortless, scattered, and difficult to access, provided monks and hermits sufficiently isolated and inhospitable conditions to live out Christian solitude, contemplation, and devotion. Many of the caves and irregularities in the cliff-sides were adapted to serve as individual dwellings (cells), chapels, and monasteries, and such buildings were further carved out of the cliff faces of the valley. Some have interiors covered with frescoes and facades. Around the caves there are terraced fields made by the hermits for growing grain, grapes, and olives.\nWhile there are numerous monasteries in the valley, there are several main monastic complexes:\n\nQannubin Monastery\nThe Qannubin Monastery (Deir Qannubin (دير قنوبين)), is on the northeast side of the Qadisha Valley. Although its foundation is often attributed to the Emperor Theodosius the Great in 375AD, it is more likely that it was established by a disciple of St Theodosius the Cenobite. For the most part it is cut into the rock cliff side - monastic cells, church, cloister, and accommodation for travelers.\nSince the fifteenth century, Qannubin started to be the See of the Maronite Patriarch.\n\nMonastery of St Anthony of Qozhaya\nThe Monastery of Qozhaya (Deir Mar Antonios Qozhaya (دير مارانطﻮنيوﺱ ﻗﺰحيا)) sits on the opposite flank of the Qadisha from Qannubin Monastery. Tradition has its foundation in the 4th century by St Hilarion, in honour of the Egyptian anchorite, St Anthony the Great, though the earliest documentary records date back only to around 1000 AD. It was destroyed in the 16th century but quickly restored. It comprises a corridor, meeting room, and chapel, with a mill and a number of hermitages cut into the rock nearby.\nThe monastery is also home to the first printing press of the Middle East that was invented in 1610. The book printed was a bilingual Psalter in a small folio of 260 pages. The psalms are arranged in two columns, on the right is the text in Syriac and on the left in Arabic, but written in Syriac letters, which is known as Garshuni.\n\nMonastery of Our Lady of Hawqa\nSaydet Hawqa is situated at an altitude of 1150m between Qannubin and Qozhaya Monasteries, at the base of an enormous cave. It was founded in the late 13th century by villagers from Hawqa. The hermitage appears to have been located on a wide platform at mid-level, where there is a water reservoir fed by channels. The upper level, only accessible by ladder, is a cave some 47m long, where the wealth of medieval pottery and arrowheads that have been found suggests its use as a refuge. Traces of fortifications have also been found in the Aassi Hauqqa (cave) at 1170m altitude. Archaeological finds show that this cave was in use in Palaeolithic, Roman, and Medieval times.\n\nMonastery of Mar Sarkis\nThe Monastery of Mar Sarkis, also called Ras Al Nahr, overlooks Ehden, Kfarsghab, Bane and Hadath El Jebbeh. Given its exceptional location overlooking the valley at an altitude of 1500m, the monastery is called the Watchful Eye of Qadisha. It is dedicated to Saints Sarkis and Bakhos (Saints Sergius and Bacchus). The name Ras Al Nahr means the top of the river as it is in the vicinity of the Mar Sarkis source, the main contributor to the Qlaynsieh River which joins the Qannubin River in the valley.\nThe first church of Saints Sarkis and Bakhos was built in the mid 8th Century A.D. on the ruins of a Canaanite temple dedicated to a god of agriculture - Dagan. Next to it, another church dedicated to Our Lady was constructed in 1198 A.D. Several buildings were added from 1404 till 1690, when Patriarch Estephan Douaihy restored part of the buildings.\n\nMonastery of Mar Lishaa\nMar Lishaa or St Elisha (دير مار ﺃليشع), mentioned first in the 14th century, is shared by two communities, a Maronite solitary order and the Barefoot Carmelite order. It consists of three or four small cells, a refectory, and some offices; the communal church includes four chapels cut into the rock-face.\n\nOther monasteries\nOther monastic establishments in the Qadisha are the Monastery of Mar Girgis, with the Chapel of Mar Challita, the Monastery of Mar Yuhanna, the Monastery of Mar Abun, with the Hermitage of Mar Sarkis, and the Monastery of Mart Moura, Ehden and others. There is another group of monasteries in the adjoining Hadchit Valley (Ouadi Houlat). They include the hermitage-monastery complexes of Deir es-Salib, Mar Antonios, Mar Semaane, and Mar Assia, along with the isolated chapels of Mar Bohna and Mar Chmouna.\n\nTowns, villages, and monasteries\nIn Bsharri District\nBsharri, Dimane, Bane, Blaouza, Tourza, Hasroun, Bazaoun, Bqarqacha, Bqaa Kafra, Braissat, Hadchit, Blaouza, Hadath, Monastery of Qannoubine, Monastery of Hawqa\n\nIn Zgharta District\nArbet Qozhaya, Ehden, Kfarsghab, Hawqa, Aintourine, Sereel, El Fradiss, Mazraat En Nahr, Beit Balais, Monastery of Qozhaya, Monastery of Mar Sarkis Ras Al Nahr\n\nMap\nSee also\nHadath el Jebbeh#Jebbeh for the meaning of Jebbeh, Jebbet\nMaronite mummies\nList of World Heritage Sites in the Arab states\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nQadisha.org\nDestination Lebanon: Qadisha (includes a brochure with photo gallery and map)\nMar Antonios Qozhaya Maronite Monastery\nHorsh Ehden Natural Reserve\nZgharta-Ehden Municipality\nUnofficial site about Zgharta and Ehden\nUnofficial site about Bsharri\nWadi Qannoubine, Kadisha Valley in 360\nEhden Family Tree",

          "content": "The Cedars of God (Arabic: أرز الربّ, romanized: Arz el-Rab, lit. 'Cedars of the Lord') is a forest in the Kadisha Valley of Bsharre, Lebanon. It is a vestige of the extensive forests of the Lebanon cedar that thrived across Mount Lebanon in antiquity. Early modern travelers' accounts of the wild cedars appear to refer to the ones in Bsharri; the Christian monks of the monasteries in the Kadisha Valley venerated the trees for centuries. The earliest documented references of the Cedars of God are found in Tablets 4–6 of the Epic of Gilgamesh.\nThe Phoenicians, Israelites, Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Romans, Arabs, and Turks used Lebanese timber. The Egyptians valued it for shipbuilding, and in the Ottoman Empire the timber was used to construct railways.\n\nHistory\nAncient history\nThe mountains of Lebanon were once shaded by thick cedar forests. After centuries of persistent deforestation, the extent of the forests has been markedly reduced.\nIt was once said that a battle occurred between the demigods and the humans over the beautiful and divine forest of cedar trees near southern Mesopotamia.  This forest, once protected by the Sumerian god Enlil, was completely bared of its trees when humans entered its grounds 4700 years ago, after winning the battle against the guardians of the forest, the demigods.  The story also tells that Gilgamesh used cedar wood to build his city.\nOver the centuries, cedar wood was exploited by the Phoenicians, Egyptians, Israelites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Romans, Arabs, and Turks.  The Phoenicians used the cedars for their merchant fleets. They needed timbers for their ships and the cedar woods made them the \"first sea trading nation in the world\". The Egyptians used cedar resin for the mummification process and the cedar wood for some of \"their first hieroglyph bearing rolls of papyrus\".  In the Bible, Solomon procured cedar timber to build the Temple in Jerusalem. The Cedar Forest of ancient Mesopotamian religion appears in several sections of the Epic of Gilgamesh. The Lebanon cedar is mentioned 103 times in the Bible. In the Hebrew text it is named ארז and in the Greek text (LXX) it is named κέδρου. For example in Zechariah there is the verse \"Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.\"\n\nEarly modern history\nEarly modern travelers' accounts of the wild cedars of Lebanon appear to refer to the Bsharri cedars. Pierre Belon visited the area in 1550, making him the first modern traveler to identify the Cedars of God in his Observations. Belon counted 28 trees:\n\nAt a considerable height up the mountains the traveler arrives at the Monastery of the Virgin Mary, which is situated in the valley. Thence proceeding four miles up the mountain, he will arrive at the cedars, the Maronites or the monks acting as guides. The cedars stand in a valley, and not on top of the mountain, and they are supposed to amount to 28 in number, though it is difficult to count them, they being distant from each other a few paces. These the Archbishop of Damascus has endeavored to prove to be the same that Solomon planted with his own hands in the quincunx manner as they now stand. No other tree grows in the valley in which they are situated and it is generally so covered with snow as to be only accessible in summer.\nLeonhard Rauwolf followed in 1573–75, counting 24 trees:\n\n ... saw nothing higher, but only a small hill before us, all covered with snow, at the bottom whereof the high cedar trees were standing... And, although this hill hath, in former ages, been quite covered with cedars, yet they are since so decreased, that I could tell no more but twenty-four that stood round about in a circle and two others, the branches whereof are quite decayed for age. I also went about this place to look for young ones, but could find none at all. \nJean de Thévenot counted 23 trees in 1655: \n\nIt is a Fobbery to say, that if one reckon the Cedars of Mount Lebanon twice, he shall have a different number, for in all, great and small, there is neither more or less than twenty three of them. \nLaurent d'Arvieux in 1660 counted 20 trees; and Henry Maundrell in 1697 counted 16 trees of the \"very old\" type:\n\nSunday, May 9 The noble (cedar] trees grow amongst the snow near the highest part of Lebanon; and are remarkable as well as for their own age and largeness, as for those frequent allusions made to them in the word of God. Here are some of them very old, and of prodigious bulk; and others younger of a smaller size. Of the former I could reckon up only sixteen, and the latter are very numerous. I measured one of the largest, and found it twelve yards six inches in girt, and yet sound; and thirty seven yards in the spread of its boughs. At about five or six yards from the ground, it was divided into five limbs, each of which was equal to a great tree. \nJean de la Roque in 1722 found 20 trees. In 1738 Richard Pococke provided a detailed description. \n\n... they form a grove about a mile in circumference, which consists of some large cedars that are near to one another, a great number of young cedars, and some pines. The great cedars, at some distance, look like very large spreading oaks; the bodies of the trees are short, dividing at bottom into three or four limbs, some of which growing up together for about ten feet, appear something like those Gothic columns, which seem to be composed of several pillars; higher up they begin to spread horizontally. One that had the roundest body, tho' not the largest, measured twenty four feet in circumference, and another with a sort of triple body, as described above, and of a triangular figure, measured twelve feet on each side. The young cedars are not easily known from pines; I observed they bear a greater quantity of fruit than the large ones. ... there are fifteen large ones standing. The Christians of the several denominations near this place come here to celebrate the festival of the transfiguration, and have built altars against several of the large trees, on which they administer the sacrament. These trees are about half a mile to the north of the road, to which we returned...\n\nFrom the 19th century onwards, the number of writers recording their visits increased substantially, and the number of cedars counted by the writers was in hundreds. Alphonse de Lamartine visited the place during his travel in Lebanon (1832–33), mentioning the cedars in some texts. In 1871, Edward Henry Palmer of the Palestine Exploration Fund described the cedars as follows:\n\nDescending by a steep zigzag path to the cedars, we pitched our camp and proceeded to examine the sacred and renowned grove, and could not repress a feeling of disappointment at its small extent, and the insignificant appearance of the trees. They consist of a little clump of trees of comparatively modern growth, not more than nine of them showing any indications of a respectable antiquity, and covering only about three acres of ground. They stand on a ridge consisting of five mounds and two spurs running nearly east and west, as in the accompanying plan. The whole number of trees we estimated at about 355; their size has also been grossly exaggerated, none of them being over 80ft. high. The ground is covered with débris of cedar and white limestone ... The trees have been lopped and otherwise maltreated ... They are scrubby scanty specimens, and not half so fine as may be seen in many an English park.\nConcern for the protection of the biblical \"cedars of God\" goes back to 1876, when the 102-hectare (250-acre) grove was surrounded by a high stone wall, paid for by Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein to protect saplings from browsing by goats. Nevertheless, during World War I, British troops used cedar to build railroads.\n\nModern history\nHenry Bordeaux visited Lebanon in 1922 and wrote Yamilé sous les cèdres (Yamilé under the cedars), a story about a Christian girl falling in love despite her family's wishes; she is shot dead under a cedar tree. A 1939 film was made by Charles d'Espinay of the story.\nTime, along with the exploitation of the wood and the effects of climate change, has led to a decrease in the number of cedar trees in Lebanon. However, Lebanon is still widely known for its cedar tree history, as they are the emblem of the country and the symbol of the Lebanese flag. The remaining trees survive in mountainous areas, where they are the dominant tree species. This is the case on the slopes of Mount Makmel that tower over the Kadisha Valley, where the Cedars of God are found at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). Four trees have reached a height of 35 metres (115 ft), with their trunks reaching 12–14 metres (39–46 ft).\nIn 1998, the Cedars of God were added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The forest is rigorously protected. It is possible to tour if escorted by an authorized guide. After a preliminary phase in which the land was cleared of detritus, the sick plants treated, and the ground fertilized, the \"Committee of the Friends of the Cedar Forest\" initiated a reforestation program in 1985. The Committee planted 200,000 cedars, with 180,000 surviving.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nDelmass cave – Cave with medieval military fortifications in Lebanon\nAl Shouf Cedar Nature Reserve – Nature reserve in Lebanon\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nHepper, F.

          "title": "Mseilha Fort",
          "content": "The Mseilha Fort (Arabic: قلعة المسيلحة, romanized: Qal'at al-Msaylḥa) is a historic fortification located in Northern Lebanon, strategically positioned on the right bank of the Al-Jaouz River, in Hamat, approximately 2.5 kilometers northeast of the city of Batroun in North Lebanon. The fort's location enabled it to oversee key passages through the valley and control the ancient pathways circumventing the coastal Ras ash-Shaq'a promontory, a significant geological formation along the Lebanese coast that historically posed challenges to travelers.\nThe name Mseilha originates from the Arabic term for \"fortified place\", a diminutive of musallaha (Arabic: مسلحة), meaning \"fortified.\" Constructed on a limestone rock formation, the current structure dates back to the 17th century, likely commissioned by Emir Fakhr al-Din II. It lacks Crusader-era architectural elements, though historical records suggest the site may have been fortified during the Crusades. The existing fort, a product of traditional sandstone masonry, consists of two main sections, fortified walls up to two meters thick, a triangular courtyard, and defensive arrowslits, with adaptive design suited to the surrounding terrain.\nThe Mseilha Fort is conflated in some sources with the Puy du Connétable, a medieval Crusader estate and fortification that defended the nearby Ras ash-Shaq'a promontory. However, architectural and historical evidence suggests that these were distinct structures, with Mseilha constructed in the Ottoman period, likely on or near the site of the earlier Crusader fortifications. The Mseilha Fort was featured on the 1964 25 Lebanese Lira banknote.\n\nLocation\nThe Mseilha Fort stands on the right bank of Al-Jaouz river, to the south-east of Ras ash-Shaq'a promontory; a massive geological formation that cuts through the coast of Lebanon, making it historically difficult for travelers to circumvent. The fort is located within the municipal area of Hamat, 2.5 km (1.6 mi) northeast of Batroun, and is strategically located to control the crossing of the Al-Jaouz river and the pathways that climb the valley slopes or bypass the promontory.\n\nNames and etymology\nThe name of the Mseilha Fort has been recorded in various forms over time, often influenced by the accounts of western travelers. The French archaeologist René Dussaud noted that Antoine-Alphonse Montfort, a French painter, was the first traveler to record the correct name of the fort, spelling it as Mseïla. The 17th-century English traveler and clergyman Henry Maundrell referred to it as Temseida, likely a corruption due to his limited familiarity with the Arabic language. Other travelers frequently misinterpreted or misspelled the name; the Swedish travel and orientalist Jakob Berggren referred to the fort as Qal’at Mezaibeha, following Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, a Swiss traveler, who wrote Kalaat Meszabeha, likely due to a misreading of his travel notes. Similarly, the German explorer Ulrich Jasper Seetzen's manuscript was, according to Dussaud, misread by his editors, resulting in Kalat Inszelha. The first documented use of the name Mseilha is attributed to Dussaud in his 1897 publication, Voyage en Syrie. Later, Swiss historian Max von Berchem, writing in 1914, used the form El-Musailiha, further contributing to the variations in the fort's recorded name. Mseilha, derives from the Arabic word for \"fortified place,\" being a diminutive form of musallaha (Arabic: مسلحة), meaning \"fortified\". Other modern alternative romanizations include Qal'at al Mouseiliha, Musayliha, and Museiliha.\n\nHistory\nStrategic importance and early defenses\nFollowing the collapse of the Ras ash-Shaq'a promontory in the aftermath of the 551 CE earthquake, the coastal road linking the cities of Batroun, El-Heri and Tripoli was lost, transforming the northern shoreline into a high sea cliff. Consequently, a new road bypassing the promontory from the east was necessary to ensure communication between the coastal cities. Crossing the Nahr el-Jaouz valley, this road turns around Ras ash-Shaq'a promontory to reach the other side at a spot near El-Heri called Bab el-Hawa (meaning the \"door of the wind\").\nDuring the Crusades, the prominent land mass of Ras ash-Shaq'a held significant strategic value in the defense of the County of Tripoli. It guarded one of the region's most perilous road segments and overlooked the Bay of Heri, a coastal area well-suited for maritime landings. Due to its strategic importance, Ras ash-Shaq'a was designated as a separate lordship, distinct from the nearby fiefs of Nephin (modern Anfe) to the north and Boutron (modern Batroun) to the south. This territory was granted as a fief to the Constable of Tripoli, and there was likely a direct connection between holding the fortification of the fief and the office of constable.\nTwelfth century historian of the First Crusade, Albert of Aix described the strategic position of the defensive fortification that then existed atop the Ras ash-Shaq'a promontory to guard a narrow pass: \n\nThis mountain, detached from the more distant mountain chain, extends over a vast area of land all the way to the sea. A tower that dominates and controls the route through one of its gates rises at the summit of this mountain. This small structure can hold no more than six men, but these few would be enough to defend the pass against all who live under the sky.\nDuring the two centuries of Frankish occupation that followed, the Crusader Counts of Tripoli fortified Ras ash-Shaq'a, referring to the estate as \"Puy du Connétable\" (Hill of the Constable), \"Puy Guillaume, and the mountain pass as \"Passe Saint-Guillaume\", all of which, according to historian Maxime Goepp likely also refer to the Mseilha Fort. In a 1109 document, Bertrand, Count of Saint-Gilles, gifted the Church of St. Lawrence of Genoa full control over the Castle of the Constabulary (Latin: Castrum Constabularii) Gibellum (modern Jbeil), and one-third of Tripoli's territory. This lordship would be maintained until 1278, with the lords of Le Puy appearing as constables of the County up to that date. Around 1276, the vicinity of the Puy du Connétable was the site of a battle during the war between Guy II Embriaco of Gibelet and the Knights Templar against Bohemond VII, Count of Tripoli.\n\nConnection to the Puy du Connétable\nThe Mseilha Fort is conflated in some sources with the Puy du Connétable, but the exact location and extent of the latter remains uncertain with historians like Emmanuel-Guillaume Rey, and Henri Lammens, suggesting that the Puy likely referred to the estate located north of the promontory in al-Heri, or to a previous structure at the location of the Mseilha Fort respectively.  Scholars noted that while the rock on which the fort stands may have served as a military position in ancient times, the current fort structure does not include any elements from the Crusader era. The construction techniques, cutting methods, stone block sizes, and low arched doors and windows, among other elements, suggest that the current structure was built in the 17th century at the earliest.  The nineteenth-century French historian Ernest Renan could not relate the architectural elements in Mseilha to anything earlier than the Middle Ages. Paul Deschamps, a 20th-century historian of Crusader architecture, confirmed the lack of any Crusader-era features in the current fort but did not rule out the possibility that it replaced earlier Crusader constructions, as surviving Frankish literature indicates the Crusaders had fortified the strategic pass between Ras ash-Shaq'a and the foothills of Mount Lebanon.  Deschamps further posits, that the tower described by Albert of Aix during the march of the First Crusade in 1099 may have been located on the Mseilha rock, a theory echoed by French historians René Grousset and Jean Richard.\nModern scholars Davie and Salamé-Sarkis distinguish the Mseilha Fort from the historical Puy du Connétable. According to them, the entire promontory of Ras ash-Shaq'a was known from 1109 to 1282 in Crusader-era texts as Puy du Connétable. The estate was defended by the Castrum Constabularii, as mentioned in Bertrand of Saint-Gilles' 1109 document, which likely replaced an earlier tower described by Albert of Aix. According to  scholars Davie and Salamé-Sarkis, this tower may have been situated at the summit of Jabal an-Nuriyya, a strategic position on the northern tip of the Ras al Shaq'a promontory, that enabled monitoring of both the mountain pass and the bay of Heri.\n\nConstruction and historical mentions\nFrench traveler Jean de La Roque passed near the Mseilha Fort in late 1689 on his route from Tripoli to Batroun. He recorded a local account attributing the fort's construction to Emir Fakhr al-Din II, the Druze former ruler of Lebanon. Nineteenth century Lebanese scholar Father Mansur Tannus al-Hattuni, recounting events of 1624, noted that Emir Fakhr al-Din II \"ordered Sheikh Abu Nadir al-Khazin to construct the Mseilha Fort north of Batroun\". Hattuni's source, Tannus al-Shidyaq, mentions that the fort was built by Fakhr al-Din II and added in his account of 1631—six years after the fort's construction—that Abu Nadir al-Khazin conducted restoration work on the fort.  The year 1624 is accepted as the date of the fort's construction. Burckhardt, who visited the area in the early 19th century and confirmed that Mseilha Fort was of relatively recent origin. Maundrell, writing in 1697, described it as a small fort perched upon a steep, perpendicular rock, with walls conforming to the rock's natural shape, commanding the passage into a narrow valley.\n\nModern era\nAntoine-Alphonse Montfort took part in an expedition between 1837 and 1838 to visit Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, and kept a detailed travel diary, which is now part of the collection of the Bibliothèque nationale de France. He sketched landscapes, historical sites, and fortifications, among which the Mseilha Fort. Max Van Berchem and the Swiss architect Edmond Fatio, conducted the first comprehensive archaeological study of the site and documented their observations in their 1914 publication, Voyage en Syrie. The Mseilha Fort was featured on the reverse of the 25 Lebanese Lira banknote issued between 1964 and 1983. In 2007, restoration works were undertaken to make the site safe for visitors. Funded by USAID, these works are a continuation of a project conducted by SRI International-INMA to rehabilitate the fort, in cooperation with the Lebanese Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Culture - Directorate General of Antiquities.\n\nArchitecture and description\nThe Mseilha fort is 15 m (49 ft) high, built on a narrow limestone rocky outcrop. Its walls range from 1.5 to 2 m (4.9 to 6.6 ft) in thickness, and were built with medium-sized sandstone blocks, although some larger limestone blocks are also present, likely repurposed from older structures. The fort was built in two phases, resulting in two adjoining sections that form a single architectural unit. It is approached through a narrow, steep path on the northern side of the rock, which incorporates steps carved directly into the bedrock. This path leads to a small masonry terrace and a low, rounded-arch doorway. The entrance opens into a narrow, triangular courtyard bordered by a two-bay vaulted building on the southern side, possibly used for storage, with as a cistern in its lower level.  The curtain wall on the southern side rises approximately two meters higher than the northern wall, likely an intentional design to counterbalance the elevated mountain terrain to the south, which offers a natural strategic advantage controlling the entrance of the Nahr el-Jaouz valley. In the west tower, an archery chamber offers a vantage point with narrow arrow slits. The eastern section of the fort is more elevated and fortified, with a cluster of vaulted rooms surrounding a small inner courtyard. From this courtyard, a staircase leads to an upper level, where each room is similarly equipped with arrow slits for defense. At the easternmost tip, a square tower juts forward.\n\nSee also\nMuseiliha inscription – First-century AD inscribed boundary marker\nGigarta – Ancient settlement in North Lebanon\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nAlbert of Aix (1824) [c. 1100].

          "summary": "The Mseilha Fort (Arabic: قلعة المسيلحة, romanized: Qal'at al-Msaylḥa) is a historic fortification located in Northern Lebanon, strategically positioned on the right bank of the Al-Jaouz River, in Hamat, approximately 2.5 kilometers northeast of the city of Batroun in North Lebanon. The fort's location enabled it to oversee key passages through the valley and control the ancient pathways circumventing the coastal Ras ash-Shaq'a promontory, a significant geological formation along the Lebanese coast that historically posed challenges to travelers.\nThe name Mseilha originates from the Arabic term for \"fortified place\", a diminutive of musallaha (Arabic: مسلحة), meaning \"fortified.\" Constructed on a limestone rock formation, the current structure dates back to the 17th century, likely commissioned by Emir Fakhr al-Din II. It lacks Crusader-era architectural elements, though historical records suggest the site may have been fortified during the Crusades. The existing fort, a product of traditional sandstone masonry, consists of two main sections, fortified walls up to two meters thick, a triangular courtyard, and defensive arrowslits, with adaptive design suited to the surrounding terrain.\nThe Mseilha Fort is conflated in some sources with the Puy du Connétable, a medieval Crusader estate and fortification that defended the nearby Ras ash-Shaq'a promontory. However, architectural and historical evidence suggests that these were distinct structures, with Mseilha constructed in the Ottoman period, likely on or near the site of the earlier Crusader fortifications. The Mseilha Fort was featured on the 1964 25 Lebanese Lira banknote.",

          "content": "The Temple of Eshmun (Arabic: معبد أشمون) is an ancient place of worship dedicated to Eshmun, the Phoenician god of healing. It is located near the Awali river, 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) northeast of Sidon in southwestern Lebanon. The site was occupied from the 7th century BC to the 8th century AD, suggesting an integrated relationship with the nearby city of Sidon. Although originally constructed by Sidonian king Eshmunazar II in the Achaemenid era (c. 529–333 BC) to celebrate the city's recovered wealth and stature, the temple complex was greatly expanded by Bodashtart, Yatonmilk and later monarchs. Because the continued expansion spanned many centuries of alternating independence and foreign hegemony, the sanctuary features a wealth of different architectural and decorative styles and influences.\nThe sanctuary consists of an esplanade and a grand court limited by a huge limestone terrace wall that supports a monumental podium which was once topped by Eshmun's Greco-Persian style marble temple. The sanctuary features a series of ritual ablution basins fed by canals channeling water from the Asclepius river (modern Awali) and from the sacred \"YDLL\" spring; these installations were used for therapeutic and purificatory purposes that characterize the cult of Eshmun. The sanctuary site has yielded many artifacts of value, especially those inscribed with Phoenician texts, such as the Bodashtart inscriptions and the Eshmun inscription, providing valuable insight into the site's history and that of ancient Sidon.\nThe Eshmun Temple was improved during the early Roman Empire with a colonnade street, but declined after earthquakes and fell into oblivion as Christianity replaced polytheism and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures. The temple site was rediscovered in 1900 by local treasure hunters who stirred the curiosity of international scholars. Maurice Dunand, a French archaeologist, thoroughly excavated the site from 1963 until the beginning of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. After the end of the hostilities and the retreat of Israel from Southern Lebanon, the site was rehabilitated and inscribed to the World Heritage Site tentative list.\n\nEshmun\nEshmun (Latinized form of the Phoenician 𐤀𐤔𐤌𐤍‎) was the Phoenician god of healing and renewal of life; he was one of the most important divinities of the Phoenician pantheon and the main male divinity of Sidon. Originally a nature divinity, and a god of spring vegetation, Eshmun was equated to Babylonian deity Tammuz. His role later expanded within the Phoenician pantheon, and he gained celestial and cosmic attributes. The myth of Eshmun was related by the sixth century Syrian Neoplatonist philosopher Damascius and ninth century Patriarch of Constantinople, Photius. They recount that Eshmun, a young man from Beirut, was hunting in the woods when Astarte saw him and was stricken by his beauty. She harassed him with her amorous pursuit until he emasculated himself with an axe and died. The grieving goddess revived Eshmun and transported him to the heavens where she made him into a god of heaven.\nFrom a historical perspective, the first written mention of Eshmun goes back to 754 BC, the date of the signing of the treaty between Assyrian king Ashur-nirari V and Mati'el, king of Arpad; Eshmun figures in the text as a patron of the treaty. Eshmun was identified with Asclepius as a result of the Hellenic influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from Amrit and Acre from the third century BC. This fact is exemplified by the Hellenized names of the Awali river which was dubbed Asclepius fluvius, and the Eshmun Temple's surrounding groves, known as the groves of Asclepius.\n\nHistory\nHistorical background\nIn the 9th century BC, the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II conquered the Lebanon mountain range and its coastal cities. The new sovereigns exacted tribute from Sidon, along with every other Phoenician city. These payments stimulated Sidon's search for new means of provisioning and furthered Phoenician emigration and expansion, which peaked in the 8th century BC. When Assyrian king Sargon II died in 705 BC, King Luli joined with the Egyptians and Judah in an unsuccessful rebellion against Assyrian rule, but was forced to flee to Kition (modern Larnaca in Cyprus) with the arrival of the Assyrian army headed by Sennacherib, Sargon II's son and successor. Sennacherib instated Ittobaal on the throne of Sidon and reimposed the annual tribute. When Abdi-Milkutti ascended to Sidon's throne in 680 BC, he also rebelled against the Assyrians. In response, the Assyrian king Esarhaddon laid siege to the city. Abdi-Milkutti was captured and beheaded in 677 BC after a three-year siege, while his city was destroyed and renamed Kar-Ashur-aha-iddina (the harbor of Esarhaddon). Sidon was stripped of its territory, which was awarded to Baal I, the king of rival Tyre, and loyal vassal to Esarhaddon. Baal I and Esarhaddon signed a treaty in 675 in which Eshmun's name features as one of the deities invoked as guarantors of the covenant.\n\nConstruction\nSidon returned to its former level of prosperity while Tyre was besieged for 13 years (586–573 BC) by Nebuchadnezzar II. Nevertheless, the Sidonian king was still held in exile at the court of Babylon. Sidon reclaimed its former standing as Phoenicia's chief city in the Achaemenid Empire (c.529–333 BC). Eshmunazar I, a priest of Astarte, and the founder of his namesake dynasty, became king around the time of the Achaemenid conquest of the Levant. Archaeological evidence suggest that, at the time of the advent of the Eshmunazar dynasty, there already was a cultic space on the site of the temple, but there were no monumental constructions yet. Originally, the center of worship may have been a cave or a spring.\nIn the following years, Xerxes I awarded king Eshmunazar II with the Sharon plain for employing Sidon's fleet in his service during the Greco-Persian Wars. Eshmunazar II displayed his new-found wealth by constructing numerous temples to Sidonian divinities. Inscriptions found on the king's sarcophagus reveal that he and his mother, Amoashtart, built temples to the gods of Sidon, including the Temple of Eshmun by the \"Ydll source near the cistern\".  As the Bodashtart inscriptions on the foundations of the monumental podium attest, construction of the sanctuary's podium did not begin until the reign of King Bodashtart. The first set of inscriptions bears the name of Bodashtart alone, while the second contains his name and that of the crown prince Yatonmilk.  Thirty foundation inscriptions are known to date; they were found concealed in the interior of the podium. The practice of intentional inscription concealment can be traced back to Mesopotamian roots, and it has parallels in the royal buildings of the Achaemenids in Persia and Elam. A Phoenician inscription, located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) upstream from the temple, that dates to the 7th year of Bodashtart's reign, alludes to water adduction works from the Awali river to the \"Ydll\" source that was used for ritual purification at the temple.\n\nRoman era and decline\nThe Eshmun sanctuary was damaged by an earthquake in the fourth century BC, which demolished the marble temple atop the podium; this structure was not rebuilt but many chapels and temples were later annexed at the base of the podium. The temple site remained a place of pilgrimage in the classical antiquity during the early Roman Empire and until the advent of Christianity, when the cult of Eshmun was banned during the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire and a Christian church was built at the temple site across the Roman street from the podium. A Roman colonnade was built in the third century, probably by emperor Septimius Severus, and a Roman Villa showed a period of renewed relative importance for the city during the late period of Phoenicia under Roman rule. Furthermore, within the original Phoenician temple site the Romans added the processional stairway, the basins for ablutions and a nymphaeum with pictorial mosaics, that are still largely intact. Worn statuettes of three nymphs stand in the niches of a Roman fountain. Another earthquake hit Sidon around 570 AD; Antoninus of Piacenza, an Italian Christian pilgrim, described the city as partly in ruins. For many years after the disappearance of the cult of Eshmun, the sanctuary site was used as a quarry: Emir Fakhr-al-Din II used its massive blocks to build a bridge over the Awali river in the 17th century. The site later fell into oblivion until the 19th century\n\nModern discovery\nBetween 1737 and 1742, Richard Pococke, an English anthropologist, toured the Middle East and wrote of what he thought were ruins of defensive walls built with 3.7-metre (12 ft) stone blocks near the Awali river. When the French orientalist Ernest Renan visited the area in 1860, he noticed that the Awali bridge abutments were built of finely rusticated blocks that originated from an earlier structure. He also noted in his report, Mission de Phénicie, that a local treasure hunter told him of a large edifice near the Awali bridge. The discovery was made in 1900 by four workers who were extracting blocks from the temple on behalf of Druze notable Nassib Jumblatt. They noticed that certain blocks had inscriptions with the engravings painted in red. A local antiques dealer bought three of the stones, all with the same inscription. Due to the enormous size of the blocks, they were cut down to just 15 or 20 cm in thickness, and some stones were also cut into two or three pieces. The Ottoman authorities dispatched Theodore Makridi, curator of the Museum of Constantinople, who cleared the temple remains between 1901 and 1903. Wilhelm Von Landau also excavated the site between 1903 and 1904. In 1920, Gaston Contenau headed a team of archaeologists who again surveyed the temple complex. The first extensive archaeological excavation revealing the Eshmun Temple remains was undertaken by Maurice Dunand between 1963 and 1975. Archaeological evidence shows that the site was occupied from the seventh century BC to the eighth century AD.\n\nAfter 1975\nDuring the Lebanese Civil War and the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon (1985–2000), the temple site was neglected and was invaded by vegetation overgrowth; it was cleared and recovered its former condition after the Israeli withdrawal. Today the Eshmun sanctuary can be visited all year round and free of charge, it is accessible from an exit ramp off the main Southern Lebanon highway near Sidon's northern entrance. The site holds a particular archaeological importance since it is the best preserved Phoenician site in Lebanon; it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List's Cultural category on July 1, 1996. In literature, the temple of Eshmun figures in Nabil Saleh's 2009 novel, The Curse of Ezekiel as the setting where Bomilcar falls in love and rescues princess Chiboulet from the evil design of one of the temple's priests. The site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on July 11, 2019, in the Cultural category. During the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, UNESCO gave enhanced protection to 34 cultural sites in Lebanon including the sanctuary of Eshmun to safeguard it from damage.\n\nLocation\nA number of ancient texts mention the Eshmun Temple and its location. The Phoenician inscriptions on the sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II, a Sidonian king, commemorate the construction of a \"house\" for the \"holy prince\" Eshmun by the king and his mother, queen Amashtart, at the \"Ydll source by the cistern\". Dionysius Periegetes, an ancient Greek travel writer, identified the Eshmun temple by the Bostrenos River, and Antonin de Plaisance, a 6th-century AD Italian pilgrim recorded the shrine as near the river Asclepius fluvius. Strabo and other Sidonian sources describe the sanctuary and its surrounding \"sacred forests\" of Asclepius, the Hellenized name of Eshmun, in written texts. Located about 40 kilometres (25 mi) south of Beirut and 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) northeast of Sidon, the Eshmun Temple sits on the southern bank of the modern Awali river, previously referred to as Bostrenos or Asclepius fluvius in ancient texts. Citrus groves, known as Bustan el-Sheikh (Arabic: بستان الشيخ, the grove of the Sheikh), occupy the ancient \"sacred forests\" of Asclepius and are a favorite summer picnic location for locals.\n\nArchitecture and description\nBuilt under Babylonian rule (605–539 BC), the oldest monument at the site was a pyramidal building resembling a ziggurat that included an access ramp to a water cistern. Fragments of an early, Babylonian-style temple survived into modern time; these include marble torus-shaped column bases with moldings, facetted columns, and bull protome capitals. The Babylonian-style temple was dismantled around the middle of the 4th century BC. The remains of the demolished temple were cast in a favissa that only contained material dating from the 5th and first half of the 4th century BC.\nThe pyramidal structure was superimposed during the Persian period by a massive ashlar podium constructed from heavily bossed limestone blocks that measured more than 3 metres (9.8 ft) across by 1 metre (3.3 ft) thick, which were laid down in courses 1-metre (3.3 ft) high. The podium stands 22 metres (72 ft) high, runs 50 metres (160 ft) into the hillside, and boasts a 70-metre (230 ft) wide façade. The terrace atop of the podium was once covered by a Greco-Persian style marble temple built in the Ionic order around 500 BC. The marble temple has been reduced to a few remaining stone fragments due to theft. During the Hellenistic period, the sanctuary was extended from the base of the podium across the valley. To the east base of the podium stands a large chapel, 10.5 by 11.5 metres (34 ft × 38 ft), dating to the 4th century BC. The chapel was adorned with a paved pool and a large stone \"Throne of Astarte\" carved of a single block of granite in the Egyptian style; it is flanked by two sphinx figures and surrounded by two lion sculptures. The throne, attributed to the Sidonian goddess Astarte, rests against the chapel wall, which is embellished by relief sculptures of hunting scenes. The once important Astarte basin lost its function during the 2nd century AD and was filled with earth and statue fragments. The west base contains another 4th-century BC chapel – centered on a bull protome topped capital – that remains preserved at the National Museum of Beirut.\nWidely known as the \"Tribune of Eshmun\" because of its shape, the altar of Eshmun is a white marble structure dating to the 4th century BC. It is 2.15 metres (7.1 ft) long by 2.26 metres (7.4 ft) wide and 2.17 metres (7.1 ft) tall. Unearthed in 1963 by Maurice Dunand, it stands on a limestone socleplated with marble blocks that rest against a retaining wall. The altar is adorned with Hellenistic style relief sculptures and is framed by decorative moldings, one of which divides the altar into two distinct registers of symmetrical composition. The upper register portrays 18 Greek deities, including two charioteers surrounding the Greek god Apollo, who is depicted playing a cithara (a type of lyre). The lower register honors Dionysus, who leads his thiasos (his ecstatic retinue) in a dance to the music of pipe and cithara players. The Tribune is displayed at the National Museum of Beirut. \n\nNortheast of the site, another 3rd century BC temple stands adjacent to the Astarte chapel. Its 22-metre (72 ft) façade is built with large limestone blocks and displays a two-register relief decoration illustrating a drunken revelry in honor of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine. Among the temple reliefs, one shows a man attempting to seize a large rooster which was the common sacrificial animal for Eshmun-Asclepius. The Eshmun Temple complex comprises an elaborate hydraulic installation channeling water from \"Ydll\" spring that is made up of an intricate system of water canals, a series of retaining basins, sacred ablution basins and paved pools. This system demonstrates the importance of ritual ablutions in Phoenician therapeutic cults. Later vestiges date from the Roman epoch and include a colonnaded road lined with shops. Of the large marble columns bordering the Roman street only fragments and bases remain. The Romans also built a monumental staircase adorned with mosaic patterns that leads to the top of the podium. To the right of the Roman road, near the entrance of the site stands a nymphaeum with niches where statues of the nymphs once stood. The floor of the nymphaeum is covered by a mosaic depicting the Maenads. Across the colonnaded road, facing the nymphaeum, are the ruins of a Roman villa; only the villa's courtyard has survived along with the remains of a mosaic depicting the four seasons. To the right of the processional Roman staircase stands a cubic altar, also of Roman construction. Other Roman period structures include two columns of a great portico leading to pools and other cultic installations.\n\nFunction\nEshmun's cult enjoyed a particular importance at Sidon as he was the chief deity after 500 BC. Aside from the extramural sanctuary at Bustan el-Sheikh, Eshmun also had a temple within the city. The extramural Eshmun Temple was associated with purification and healing; ritual lustral ablutions were performed in the sanctuary's sacred basins supplemented by running water from the Asclepius River and the \"Ydll\" spring water which was considered to have a sacred character and therapeutic quality. The healing attributions of Eshmun were combined with his divine consort Astarte's fertilizing powers; the latter had an annex chapel with a sacred paved pool within the Eshmun sanctuary. Pilgrims from all over the ancient world flocked to the Eshmun Temple leaving votive traces of their devotion and proof of their cure. There is evidence that from the 3rd century BC onwards there have been attempts to Hellenize the cult of Eshmun and to associate him with his Greek counterpart Asclepius, but the sanctuary retained its curative function.\n\nArtifacts and finds\nApart from the large decorative elements, carved friezes and mosaics which were left in situ, many artifacts were recovered and moved from the Eshmun Temple to the National Museum of Beirut, the Louvre or are in possession of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities. Some of these smaller finds include a collection of inscribed ostraca unearthed by Dunand providing rare examples of cursive Phoenician writing in the Phoenician mainland. One of the recovered ostracon bears the theophoric Phoenician name \"grtnt\" which suggests that veneration of the lunar-goddess Tanit occurred in Sidon. A number of fragmented votive life-size sculptures of little children lying on their side and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among the best known of these is the Baalshillem Temple Boy, a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand. The boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem II, a Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy. These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice of the sick child. All of these sculptures represent boys. A31.5 cm × 27 cm (12.4 in × 10.6 in) limestone bust of a Kouros dating from the 6th century BC was found at the site, but unlike the archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare. Among the notable finds is a golden plaque showing a snake curling on a staff, a Hellenic symbol of Eshmun. and a granite altar bearing the name of Egyptian Pharaoh Achoris uncovered in the Eshmun sanctuary. This gift attests to the good relations between the Pharaoh and the kings of Sidon. The repute of the sanctuary was far reaching. Cypriot pilgrims from Paphos left marks of their devotion for Astarte on a marble stele inscribed both in Greek and Cypriot syllabary at Astarte's shrine; this stele is now in the custody of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities.\n\nPillaging\nTreasure hunters have sought out the Eshmun Temple since antiquity; around 1900 artifacts bearing Phoenician inscriptions from the temple site found their way to Beirut's antiquities markets where they stirred the interest of the Ottoman authorities and prompted a series of archeological digs. During the civil war, upon a request from then Lebanese director general of antiquities Maurice Chehab, Maurice Dunand moved more than 2000 artifacts from Sidon to a subterranean chamber at the Byblos crusader castle, 30 kilometres (19 mi) north of Beirut. In 1981, the depot was looted and around 600 sculptures and architectural elements were stolen and smuggled out of Lebanon. Rolf Stucky, ex-director of the Institute of Classical Archaeology of Basel affirmed during a conference in Beirut in December 2009 the successful identification and return of eight sculptures to the Lebanese national museum.\n\nSee also\nPhoenician sanctuary of Kharayeb – Historic temple remains in Lebanon\nRoman temple of Bziza – Cultural heritage building in Bziza, Lebanon\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nStucky's drawings architectural elements and reconstructed model of the Temple of Eshmun",
          "summary": "The Temple of Eshmun (Arabic: معبد أشمون) is an ancient place of worship dedicated to Eshmun, the Phoenician god of healing. It is located near the Awali river, 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) northeast of Sidon in southwestern Lebanon. The site was occupied from the 7th century BC to the 8th century AD, suggesting an integrated relationship with the nearby city of Sidon. Although originally constructed by Sidonian king Eshmunazar II in the Achaemenid era (c. 529–333 BC) to celebrate the city's recovered wealth and stature, the temple complex was greatly expanded by Bodashtart, Yatonmilk and later monarchs. Because the continued expansion spanned many centuries of alternating independence and foreign hegemony, the sanctuary features a wealth of different architectural and decorative styles and influences.\nThe sanctuary consists of an esplanade and a grand court limited by a huge limestone terrace wall that supports a monumental podium which was once topped by Eshmun's Greco-Persian style marble temple. The sanctuary features a series of ritual ablution basins fed by canals channeling water from the Asclepius river (modern Awali) and from the sacred \"YDLL\" spring; these installations were used for therapeutic and purificatory purposes that characterize the cult of Eshmun. The sanctuary site has yielded many artifacts of value, especially those inscribed with Phoenician texts, such as the Bodashtart inscriptions and the Eshmun inscription, providing valuable insight into the site's history and that of ancient Sidon.\nThe Eshmun Temple was improved during the early Roman Empire with a colonnade street, but declined after earthquakes and fell into oblivion as Christianity replaced polytheism and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures. The temple site was rediscovered in 1900 by local treasure hunters who stirred the curiosity of international scholars. Maurice Dunand, a French archaeologist, thoroughly excavated the site from 1963 until the beginning of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. After the end of the hostilities and the retreat of Israel from Southern Lebanon, the site was rehabilitated and inscribed to the World Heritage Site tentative list.",

          "content": "Deir al-Qamar (Arabic: دَيْر الْقَمَر, romanized: Dayr al-qamar, lit. 'Monastery of the moon') is a city south-east of Beirut in south-central Lebanon. It is located five kilometres outside of Beit ed-Dine in the Chouf District of the Mount Lebanon Governorate at 800 m of average altitude.\n\nHistory\nCrusader period\nThe oldest written reference to Deir el Qamar (Deir elcamar or Deir elchamar) goes back to 1257 and 1261 in the deeds of Julian of Shouf and Andrew of Chouf selling their lands and villages in their lordship of Chouf to the Teutonic Order as reported in Tabulae Ordinis Theutonici.\n\nOttoman period\nDuring the 16th to 18th centuries, Deir al-Qamar was the capital and the residence of the Emirate of Mount Lebanon. It is also notable for its 15th-century Fakhreddine Mosque, Fakhreddine II Palace, and the palace of the Emir Yusuf Shihab - today housing the Municipal Council. A 17th-century synagogue is still standing in the village, although closed to the public. During its peak, the city was the centre of Lebanese literary tradition.\nLady Hester Stanhope visiting Deir al-Qamar in 1812 wrote “I have traveled for nine hours together & never found a place to pitch a tent, except near one Village. The Vineyards are like stair cases, & every little flat place stuffed with mulberry trees for the silkworms, the roads are horrible, & the people savage & extraordinary, the women wearing a great tin trumpet on their heads & a veil suspended upon it, & seemingly very proud of these frightful horns.”\nIt was the first village in Lebanon to have a municipality in 1864, and it is the birthplace of many well known personalities, such as artists, writers, and politicians. It was the winter capital of the Druze Qaim-Maqamate of Lebanon (1840-1860), the summer capital being Baakleen. People from all religious backgrounds lived there and the town had a mosque, synagogue and Christian churches.\nIn the year 1860, Deir al-Qamar was destroyed during the civil war between Druze and Christians during which the town was set ablaze. Napoleon III sent a French contingent to rebuild it, recalling France ancient role as protector of the Christians in the Ottoman Empire as established by a treaty in 1523.\nIn 1864, Deir el-Qamar elected the first municipality in the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire.\nA census undertaken in Deir al-Qamar by the Ottomans during the reign of Fakhr-al-Din II's father, Qorqmaz bin-Maan, counted 156 men, all Druze. Today, 85% of Deir al-Qamar's inhabitants are Maronites and 14% are Melkites.\n\nGeneral aspect\nThe village retains a remarkable picturesque appearance with typical stone houses with red tile roofs. In 1945 it was placed under monument protection.\nIn 1943 the Lebanese president Bechara Al Khoury declared Deir al-Qamar the summer palace for the Lebanese Presidents.\nOne of the mayors was Georges Dib Nehme who also represented the region at the Parliament.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Christians made up 98.05% of registered voters in Deir al-Qamar. 73.39% of the voters were Maronite Catholics and 15.80% were Greek Catholics.\n\nReligious sites\nOne of the important mosques in Deir al-Qamar is Fakhreddine Mosque and its goes back to 15th century. Built in 1493 by the Ma'nid emir Fakhr al-Din I and restored in the sixteenth century, it is the oldest mosque in Mount Lebanon.\nOne of the most important historical and religious site in Deir al-Qamar is Our Lady of the Hill known as Saydet El Talle. This Maronite church goes back to the 15th century.\nAccording to the Maronite Heritage web site\n\nthe legend says that there was a Druze Emir in Baakline looking at the hill of Deir al-Qamar. He saw a light coming out of the hill. He gathered his soldiers and ordered them to go in the morning and dig in the land. He said to them: \"If you find an Islamic symbol, build a mosque. If you find a Christian symbol, build a church.\" The soldiers went in the morning, dug in the land and found a rock with a cross on it and under the cross there was the Moon and Venus. That was the sign that long time ago, there was a temple dedicated to the Moon and Venus and later it became a church. Earthquakes and wars might be the reason for its disappearance.\nThe rock discovered by the soldiers can be found above the old gate of the church. A Byzantine column can be found inside the church. The inhabitants honor a miraculous icon of our Lady of the Hill placed behind the altar. It was painted in 1867 by the Italian artist Guerra. On the feast of Our Lady of the Hill—the first Sunday of August—thousands of believers go in a big procession with the miraculous icon from the entrance of Deir al-Qamar to the Church.\n\nThe Church of Saidet et Tallé in Deir el Qamar is one of the most significant historical and religious sites in Mount Lebanon. The original church was destroyed by the Saracens and later rebuilt during the reign of Fakhreddine I Maan (1518-1544). For centuries, this church has been revered by both Druze and Christians in Mount Lebanon, reflecting the close ties between the two communities. According to Pierre-Marie Martin, writing in 1870, the Druze venerated the church even more than the Maronites, often traveling long distances to pray to the Virgin Mary in their own way and \"witnessing numerous miracles\". Historian Glenn Bowman further highlights that in the early nineteenth century, Druze leaders would seek the Virgin Mary's favor at Saidet et Tallé before going into battle. They would touch the image of the Virgin Mary with their flags and place dust from under the altar in their turbans. The profound veneration of this church by the Druze led local Maronites to dub it the \"Church of the Virgin of the Druze\".\nAnother important religious site in Deir al-Qamar is the Mount of the Cross where pilgrims visit the Lamb of God Shrine (built in 2007), Father Yacoub Church (restored and consecrated as a church on June 24, 2008) and the Cross (built by Fr. Yacoub in 1932).\nDeir al-Qamar also had a well-established Jewish community, and a synagogue (built in 1638) which is today the site of the French Cultural Center.\n\nJewish community\nThe first record of a Jewish community in Deir al-Qamar in modern times is found in the writings of Rabbi Joseph Soffer, who visited Lebanon in 1759. Invited to the town to write a Torah scroll, he experienced an earthquake but successfully completed his work. He also reported visiting the nearby tomb of Noah and his son Shem. The village is referenced in the Responsa literature, particularly in the \"Khut haMeshulash.\" All in all, these sources suggest that under the rule of Yusuf Shihab and Zahir al-Umar, a Jewish community existed, complete with its own beth din and synagogue. Records indicate that there was a demand for additional Torah scrolls, which wealthy Jews in the community were capable of funding.\nRabbi Joseph Schwartz provides additional insights into the Jewish community of Deir al-Qamar, estimating it consisted of around 80 householders, primarily engaged in trade. He reports that the Jews of Deir al-Qamar leased nearby mountains from the Emirs for iron production, exporting iron horseshoes throughout the country. The Jews of Deir al-Qamar are also known to be landowners of vineyards and olive plantations, participating in agriculture. A letter dated 1865 reveals that, following the hardships of 1859-1860, which compelled their departure from the village, the Jewish residents sold off all their fields and plantations to their Christian neighbors.\nAfter the 1837 Safed earthquake, the Jewish sages of Safed sought assistance from the Jews of Deir al-Qamar. Thirty-five armed Jews responded, arriving in Safed to aid in clearing the debris, retrieving the deceased for burial, and potentially providing material assistance to those impacted by the disaster. In 1847, the Jews of Deir al-Qamar fell victim to a blood libel. Nine locals were falsely accused of murdering a Maronite child who had become lost and died of exposure, freezing to death in one of the vineyards. With the assistance of the British consul, they were ultimately released from custody.\nThe 1860 civil conflict in Mount Lebanon marked the demise of the Jewish community in Deir al-Qamar. Alongside the Druze, the local Jews were compelled to depart, selling their homes and lands to the Christians. Initially, the synagogue remained under Jewish ownership, with the Jews blocking it with stones to prevent its desecration. The synagogue was eventually sold in 1893, against the advice of the sages of Jerusalem, who instructed that it should not be sold unless for the construction of a new synagogue.\n\nWax museum\nThe Marie Baz Wax Museum was created by Mr. Samir Emile Baz in the family palace. It tells the story of Lebanon from the 15th century to the present day through its main characters.\n\nImage gallery\nSee also\nChurch of Saidet et Tallé\nDeir el Qamar Synagogue\nEmirate of Mount Lebanon\nFakhreddine II Palace\nFakhreddine Mosque\n\nCitations\nGeneral and cited references\nStrehlke, E., ed.

          "content": "Zahlé (Arabic: زَحْلة) is a city in eastern Lebanon, and the capital and  largest city of Beqaa Governorate, Lebanon. With around 150,000 inhabitants, it is the third-largest city in Lebanon after Beirut and Tripoli and the fourth-largest taking the whole urban area (the Jounieh urban area is larger).\nZahlé is located 55 km (34 mi) east of the capital Beirut, close to the Beirut-Damascus road, and lies at the junction of Mount Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley, at a mean elevation of 1,000 m. Established in the 18th century by Christians, Zahlé maintains its predominantly Greek Catholic character. The city has historically enjoyed convenient accessibility via road and rail, leveraging its strategic location as a trade hub.\nZahlé is known as the \"Bride of the Beqaa\" and \"the Neighbor of the Gorge\" for its geographical location and attractiveness, but also as \"the City of Wine and Poetry\". It is famous throughout Lebanon and the region for its pleasant climate, numerous riverside restaurants and quality arak. Its inhabitants are predominantly Melkite Greek Catholic and are known in Arabic as Zahlawi.\n\nEtymology\nThe source of the city's name is unclear, some historian relate it to the ancient Roman god of fertility - Zohal. Evidence of Roman presence are the ruins found. Others claim the derives from the occasional landslides that take place on deforested hills around the town are probably at the origin of the name.\n\nHistory\nThere has been human activity in the area for at least five thousand years. In the 18th century, Zahlé was a small village of some 200 houses. Its relative geographic isolation from the local centres of power in Mount Lebanon and Syria caused the village not to have any significant allies in the region to fall back on in case of conflicts or attacks. Zahlé was burned in 1777 and 1791.\nTradition holds that many Christians migrated from the Baalbek region in the 18th century to the newer, more secure town of Zahlé on account of the Harfush dynasty's oppression and rapacity, but more critical studies have questioned that interpretation by pointing out that the dynasty was closely allied to the Orthodox Ma'luf family of Zahlé (where Mustafa Harfush took refuge some years later) and showing that depredations from various quarters as well as Zahlé's growing commercial attractiveness accounted for Baalbek's decline in the 18th century. What repression there was did not always target the Christian community per se. The Shiite 'Usayran family, for example, is also said to have left Baalbek then to avoid expropriation by the Harfushes and established itself as one of the premier commercial households of Sidon and later even served as consuls of Iran.\nAt the end of the 18th century, Zahlé had one thousand inhabitants and two hundred houses. By 1820, Zahlé's population had grown to 5,000. By 1850 it was 7,000 to 8,000 and the town had become the commercial centre for the Beka'a and main depot for the local grain harvest. Some of the factors for the expansion included the Egyptian Occupation (1831–41), which lead to the opening of the country to European trade, the Crimean War which had caused grain shortages in Europe and the expansion of silk production in Mount Lebanon.\nBesides controlling the grain trade, Zahlé became a centre for livestock from the region of Syria and produced leather, woven and dyed goods, trading with Aleppo, Damascus and Beirut. By the 1860's and 1870's the local merchants were prosperous but were still dependent on banks in Beirut for credit for their transactions.\nOn 7 September 1975, during the civil war, the Lebanese Forces militia, at that time led by Elie Hobeika agreed to 100 Syrian soldiers and 20 intelligence officers taking up strategic positions in the town.\nThe current population is not accurately known, since no census has been conducted in Lebanon since 1932, but estimates from 2017 are of a population of 386,362 people in the town proper, making it the country's fourth largest. (The locals tend to give figures of 200,000 or 300,000 inhabitants, which, however, are misleading and completely unrealistic.) The urban area includes the neighbouring towns of Saadnayel, Taalabaya, Chtaura and Jdita to the southwest, which have come to form a single urban entity since the late 1990s due to unplanned growth, and is home to about 100,000 people. The metropolitan area extends over much of the Zahlé District and additionally comprises:\n\nthe town of Kab Elias to the southwest\nthe town of Bar Elias to the south\nthe villages of Furzol, Ablah and Niha to the northeast\nand the towns of Riyaq, Haoush Hala and Ali en Nahri to the east\nwith a total population close to 200,000.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Christians made up 82.58% and Muslims made up 16.81% of registered voters in Zahlé. 28.27% of the voters were Greek Catholics, 23.77% were Maronite Catholics, 12.62% were Greek Orthodox, 10.24% were Shiite Muslims, 7.55% were Syriac Orthodox and 6.55% were Sunni Muslims.\nZahlé is one of the largest predominantly Christian towns in Lebanon and the Middle East (with Christians once forming around 90% of its total population during the French occupation) and the one with the largest number of Catholics. While several Middle Eastern cities (including Damascus, Cairo and Amman) have larger Christian communities, these do not constitute a majority. In Lebanon, Beirut also has a larger Christian population than Zahlé (in the city proper), but most of this population belongs to the Greek Orthodox confession. Jounieh is also bigger than Zahlé, and was also overwhelmingly Christian before the French withdrawal.\nOnly two Muslim families remained inside Zahlé during the civil war: Hindi and Zrein. Zahlé's Muslim minority is concentrated in the neighborhoods of Karak Nuh (where Noah's tomb is allegedly located) and Haoush al-Umara, specifically, in an area named \"Hay al-watani\", on the northeastern and southwestern edge of town, respectively. Sixty-two percent of Muslims in the area are Shia, while the remaining 38% are Sunnis. In the past the town also had a Druze minority and even a small Jewish population, most of which, however, emigrated during the Lebanese Civil War.\nZahlé has been a land of emigration since the early 20th century, with most people emigrating to South America, mainly Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina. During the civil war in the 1970s and 1980s, a new flow of migrants left the town for the United States, Canada, Australia and Brazil. In recent years, emigration has continued, with Canada and the United Arab Emirates being the main destinations. Today, an estimated 250,000 people of local descent live abroad, most of them in Colombia and Brazil.\n\nEconomy\nBeing the main town of the Beqaa Valley, Lebanon's most important agricultural region, the economy of Zahlé has long been built on agriculture. Grapes are the area's chief product, with vineyards forming a prominent feature of the surrounding landscape. Vines are also individually grown on lattice, on many of the older houses' terraces. A sizable part of the local produce supplies the three wineries present in and around the town, and the numerous distilleries producing arak, the local liquor which Zahlé is famous for.\nZahlé saw at a time a prosperous commercial activity due to its location midway between Beirut and Damascus. Paradoxically, it regained some of that activity during the civil war, when the growing instability in Beirut led to a decentralization of the economy. Furthermore, taxation was nonexistent due to the collapse of State authority, which Zahlé took advantage of to expand its industrial and commercial sectors.\nA number of companies and state bodies have their headquarters for the Beqaa region in Zahlé, including the Central Bank of Lebanon and the Lebanese Chamber of Commerce.\n\nEducation\nZahlé is evolving into a regional center of higher education, after many universities have opened branches there in recent years. Institutes of higher education currently represented in the town include:\n\nLebanese University\nSaint Joseph University\nHoly Spirit University of Kaslik\nAntonine University\nAmerican University of Science and Technology\nThe National Technical Institute\n\nTransportation\nZahlé is connected to Beirut (55 kilometres (34 mi) to the west), and from there to all coastal cities, through the Beirut-Damascus road, which passes to the southwest of the urban area. The journey can take anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the traffic. Damascus, Syria, is 73 km (45 mi) to the southeast, and is normally reached within one-and-a-half hours, excluding the waiting time at the border. Despite continuously undergoing works and repairs, the Beirut-Damascus road remains in poor condition, and is due to be replaced by a new, multimillion-dollar highway as the main international route; however, the completion date is still unclear.\nZahlé is also connected to Baalbek (36 km (22 mi) to the northeast) by the trans-Beqaa road, which continues further north towards Homs, Syria. \nDue to widespread car ownership, public transportation remains underdeveloped. There is a single bus line, which runs on the central avenue at rather irregular times. Interurban transportation is done by minivans, which stop on the Manara roundabout at the town's entrance. Zahlé's railway station was located in Muallaqa, but was abandoned after all rail transport in Lebanon stopped during the civil war.\nThere were plans to convert the nearby Rayak Air Base (located 10 km (6 mi) to the East of Zahlé), into a civil airport serving the town and the whole valley. A regional airport could prove vital when the road to Beirut is closed because of heavy snowfall. However, the project froze in the early 2000s, after the runway extension had been initiated.\n\nMain sights\nBerdawni Promenade\nThe banks of the Berdawni River have long been a place where people of Zahlé and other parts of Lebanon come to socialize. The town's most popular attraction is a 300-metre (984 ft) promenade along the river, referred to as \"Al Wadi\" (\"the valley\"). Sheltered between the ravine's limestone cliffs, it is lined up with large outdoor restaurants, cafes and playrooms, and shaded by trees. These restaurants specialize in traditional Lebanese meze served with arak. The promenade is closed during late fall and winter, when cold winds from the mountain sweep through the ravine.\n\nOur Lady of Zahlé and Bekaa\nLocated on a hilltop to the southwest of Zahlé, this is a 54-metre-high (177 ft) concrete tower, entirely clad in white marble, and topped with a 10-metre-tall (33 ft) bronze statue of the Virgin Mary, the work of an Italian artist. It is by far Zahlé's most prominent structure—visible from most of the city and from several miles around in the central Bekaa Valley. At its base is a chapel that can seat a little over a hundred people. The top of the tower features sweeping views over Zahlé and the Bekaa Valley.\n\nTown Hall (Old Serail)\nThis Ottoman building was constructed in 1850 to serve as the town's Serail. Located just downhill from Our Lady of Zahlé and Bekaa, it is a mix of local and Ottoman architecture, and features an atrium occupied by an inner garden and surrounded by arcades. Though still known as \"the Old Serail\", it currently serves as the Town Hall. In the past, the ground floor used to house the local prison, which suffered of severe overcrowding and substandard conditions. The prison was transferred in 2009 to a new location in Muallaqa, with room for about 800 inmates and much more adequate infrastructure.\n\nThe Catholic Cathedral (Our Lady of Salvation)\nThis grandiose complex dates back to 1720, and consists of a series of stone-clad buildings around a large inner courtyard: the church itself (which is the oldest part), the seat of the Archbishop (a converted former monastery), and a small chapel housing an icon, which is said to be a reproduction of a portrait of the Virgin Mary by Saint Lucas. It also features a monumental entrance, an underground cemetery, and a 40-metre-high (130 ft) bell tower, atop of which a large marble clock was mounted in 1993. Part of the complex was destroyed by a bomb attack in April 1987, and rebuilt ever since.\n\nGrand Hotel Kadri\nThe grand Hotel Kadri is a prime example of the traditional stone architecture of Zahlé, both in and out. It has long been used by most officials and dignitaries visiting the town, as its largest and most luxurious hotel. The Ottomans converted it to a hospital during World War I. During the Lebanese Civil War, it was occupied by Syrian troops and sustained enormous damage. An ambitious restoration project in the mid-1990s was able to bring it back to its former glory. The hotel closed in February 2011 due to a conflict between its direction and the Catholic Church (its effective owner since 1999) and reopened later in 2013.\n\nMemshieh Park\nSituated across the street from Grand Hotel Kadri, Memshieh is Zahlé's oldest and shadiest park (newly opened J.T.Skaff Park is larger, but contains considerably fewer trees). The park houses a collection of marble tables with mosaic depictions of several sites in Lebanon, a small pond with waterlilies, a semi-circular marble tholos, and several sculptures representing famous locals. In 2003, the municipality covered a 25 m (82 ft) fir (the park's tallest) with thousands of lights, in an attempt to break the world record for the largest natural Christmas tree.\n\nArchaeological sites\nZahlé in itself offers little archaeological interest; however, the Château Ksara winery is worth a visit for its maze of vaults which dates back to Roman times. The suburb of Karak Nuh also features a curiosity: a 40-metre-long (131 ft) stone structure inside the local mosque, which local tradition believes to be the Tomb of Noah (but is probably a section of a Roman aqueduct).\nFurthermore, there are several ancient sites of interest in nearby locations:\n\nIn Qabb Ilyas (12 km (7 mi) to the southwest): rock sculptures of three deities that seem to be of Roman origin\nIn Anjar (18 km (11 mi) to the south): the unique ruins of an Umayyad palace built following a Roman layout, using recycled Hellenistic and Roman material. The palace is classified as a World Heritage Site. A Roman temple also stands on a hilltop above nearby Majdel Anjar.\nAbove the village of Furzol (8 km (5 mi) to the northwest): a series of rock-cut Roman tombs in the limestone cliffs\nIn Niha (11 km (7 mi) to the northwest): two exquisite Roman temples bearing Phoenician architectural elements (just outside the village), and two others in need of restoration (higher up, in the area referred to as \"the Fortress\").\nTwo more sites worth visiting are a more distant trip away:\n\nKamed al Lawz (32 km (20 mi) to the south) is the most important Bronze Age settlement in Lebanon, with finds from the Phoenician, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods having been uncovered as well.\nThe  Roman archaeological complex of Baalbek (another World Heritage Site) is located 36 km (22 mi) to the northwest.\n\nCulture\nZahlé's culture has long revolved around its signature crop, the grape, and its products, wine and arak. Arak, in particular, has traditionally been served in cafés at virtually any time of the day. The city is known as \"the City of Wine and Poetry\".\nZahlé's most important cultural event is the \"Festival of the Vine\", traditionally held each September, during which concerts, plays, poetry evenings and artistic exhibitions are organized daily over the course of two or three weeks. The final Saturday evening features the crowning of the \"Maid of the Vine\", the local beauty queen, and the next afternoon, the festival closes with arguably its most popular event: a parade of floats held on the town's main avenue. \nThe other central aspect of the local culture is religious devotion. Zahlé is still a very Catholic and conservative town, and many of its inhabitants display a pride with their religious identity. \nProphet Elias (Elijah) is the town's patron saint, whose feast on July 20 is traditionally celebrated with fireworks. Another notable holiday is Corpus-Christi, celebrated on the first Thursday of June with a large-scale procession, with a torch-lit parade being held on the previous evening. The Corpus Christi celebration dates back to 1825, when the town was spared the ravages of bubonic plague.\n\nClimate\nZahlé has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa) with continental influences.\n\nPeople\nShakira, Colombian-Lebanese Singer\nSaid Akl, poet, philosopher and politician\nFouad El Turk, poet, former Lebanese ambassador to the United Nations and head of the Forum of Lebanese Ambassadors\nCharles Elachi (from nearby Riyaq), director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in NASA\nElias Hrawi, president of Lebanon 1989–1998\nJoseph Raya, Melkite Greek Catholic archbishop and civil rights activist\nLouis Khalil, Lebanese priest of the Maronite Church\nNajwa Karam, Lebanese singer and actress\nWael Kfoury, Lebanese singer and actor\nIsabel Bayrakdarian, Armenian-Canadian operatic soprano\nKarl Sharro, Lebanese-Iraqi architect and writer based in London\nMário Zagallo, Brazilian footballer and manager, is of Lebanese ancestry from Zahlé\nKhalil Khamis (born 1995), Lebanese footballer\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nZahlé is twinned with:\n\n Bordeaux, France, since 2006\n\nReferences\nView From Zahle: Security And Economic Conditions In The Central Bekaa 1980-1985\n[1]\non Lebanon and the Peace Process, \"Bashir Gemeyel and Syria Fight Over Zahle\"\nConflict and Consensus, \"Zahlé and Dayr Al-Qamar, two market towns during the civil war of the 1860s.\"\n\"Zahlé and Forzol\"\nDictionary of the Names of Towns and Villages in Lebanon, Anis Freiha, 1976\nHage Chahine, Carlos and Nevine (2008).

          "content": "Batroun (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْرُون al-Batrūn;, ancient Botrys (Ancient Greek: Βότρυς, romanized: Bótrys), is a coastal city in northern Lebanon and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It is the capital city of Batroun District.\n\nEtymology\nBatroun appears in Western Aramaic, and is attested in as bṯrwn (Arabic: بثرون) in premodern Arabic texts, with the expected lenition of t for an Aramaic term. Elie Mardini suggests the shift of the th to t in Aramaic terms in the Levant is due to the merger of certain fricatives in Levantine Arabic.\n\nHistory\nBatroun is likely the \"Batruna\" mentioned in the Amarna letters (EA 078, EA 079, EA 081, EA 087, EA 088, EA 090, EA 093, EA 095, EA 124, EA 129), dating to the 14th century B.C. Batroun was mentioned by the ancient geographers Strabo, Pliny, Ptolemy, Stephanus of Byzantium, and Hierocles. Theophanes the Confessor called the city \"Bostrys.\"\nThe Phoenicians founded Batroun on the southern side of the promontory called in classical antiquity Theoprosopon and during the Byzantine Empire, Cape Lithoprosopon. Batroun is said to have been founded by Ithobaal I (Ethbaal), king of Tyre (whose daughter Jezabel married Ahab).\n\nThe city was under Roman rule to Phoenice Province, and later after the region was Christianized became a suffragan of the Patriarch of Antioch.\nIn 551, Batroun was destroyed by an earthquake,  which also caused mudslides and made the Cape Lithoprosopon  crack.  Historians believe that Batroun's large natural harbor was formed during the earthquake.\nThree Greek Orthodox bishops are known to have come from Batroun: Porphyrius in 451, Elias about 512 and Stephen in 553 (Lequien, II, 827). According to a Greek Notitia episcopatuum, the Greek Orthodox See has existed in Batroun since the tenth century when the city was then called Petrounion. After the Muslim conquests of the region, the name was Arabicized to Batroun.\nBatroun was controlled by the Crusaders in 1104, to be known as the Lordship of Botrun as part of the County of Tripoli, until it was conquered by the Mamluk Sultanate in 1289. One of Batroun's archaeological sites is Mseilha Fort, which is constructed on an isolated massive rock with steep sides protruding in the middle of a plain surrounded by mountains.\nUnder Ottoman rule, Batroun was the centre of a kaza in the mutessariflik of Lebanon and the seat of a Maronite diocese, suffragan to the Maronite Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch. Since 1999, it has been the seat of the Maronite eparchy.\n\nEconomy and urban development\nHistorically, the city of Batroun was settled at the interface between the sea and the national road that connected Beirut to Tripoli.\nLately, the radical shift of the historical functions of the local economic tissue into a leisure service-based economy (nightclubs, bars, restaurants, stores, etc.) has become the unique and only lever of the development of the city. The economic metamorphosis has resulted in the resettlement of housing towards emerging city suburbs (nearby hills: New Batroun, Batroun Hills, Basbina, etc.) consequently to the overvaluation of the real estate market in the city centre. It clearly reveals here the constitution of a business city-centre (dedicated to leisure and business) balanced by the constitution of residential suburbs, where accelerated urban sprawl has led to the destruction of natural lands (pinewood and orange groves) and to the fatal rise in land prices.\n\nTourism\nBatroun is a major tourist destination in North Lebanon. The town boasts historic Maronite and Greek Orthodox churches. The town is also a major beach resort with a vibrant nightlife that includes pubs and nightclubs. Citrus groves surround Batroun, and the town has been famous (from the early 20th century) for its fresh lemonade sold at the cafés and restaurants on its main street. Biking along the Batroun coastline is also a major activity mainly in late summer days.\nIn 2009, the Batroun International Festival was born. It began hosting leading local and international artists. The festival takes place usually in July and/or August of each year in the old harbor area.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Christians made up 89.69% and Muslims made up 9.80% of registered voters in Batroun. 64.16% of the voters were Maronite Catholics, 16.44% were Greek Orthodox and 7.97% were Sunni Muslims.\nThe people of Batroun are mainly Maronite, Melkite, and Greek Orthodox Christians. Batroun is a titular see in the Latin Church of the Catholic Church.\n\nPolitics\nRecent years have seen municipal and parliamentary elections become a growing factor and interest in Batroun. This is mainly in the context of local and national struggle for power. The current serving Mayor of Batroun is Marcelino El Harek.\n\nLandmarks\nPhoenician Sea Wall\nEl-Bahsa beach\nMakaad El Mir\nMseilha Fort\nSt. Stephan's Cathedral, built in 1896\nHistoric Souk\nNotre Dame de la Mer\n\nSee also\nList of Crusader castles\nList of Lebanese monuments\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBarber, Malcolm (2012).

Bsharri is the location of the Cedars of God, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the only remaining place where the Cedrus libani (Lebanese cedar) tree grows natively. The region is the birthplace of famed poet, painter and sculptor Khalil Gibran; a museum in town honours his life and work.\nAs Bsharri is mountainous and experiences freezing winters, it is home to Lebanon's oldest ski resort, the Cedars Ski Resort, as well as the country's original ski lift, which was built in 1953. The resort is about 130 km (81 mi) from Beirut, approximately two hours' driving time. Qurnat as Sawdā Mountain is the highest peak in the Levant, at 3,088 meters above sea level.\nBsharri is at the head of the Holy Kadisha Valley, a natural area which contains some of the oldest Christian monastic communities in the Middle East. A center of Maronite Christianity, the area also features the largest cathedral in the Levant region, the Saint Saba Cathedral, constructed by Anthony II Peter Arida. As the city is home to nearly 40 churches and houses-of-worship, it is sometimes referred to as \"the city of churches\".\n\nHistory\nThe name Bsharri (بشرّي), Beth Shareer, can be found in the Aramaic language. Bsharri means House of Truth in Aramaic. Maronite Christians fleeing persecution sought refuge in its mountainous terrain in the 7th Century AD.  The Kadisha Valley, below the town, became the spiritual center of the Maronite Church. The town was known as Buissera by the Crusades.\nResidents of Bsharri are known for their distinct accent when they speak Lebanese Arabic. Unlike other parts of Lebanon, Aramaic was spoken in Bsharri as a liturgical language well into the 19th century. As a result, Bsharri natives developed an unmistakably strong accent that lasts to this day.\nDuring the Lebanese civil war, many young men joined the Lebanese Phalanges. In 1986 Samir Geagea, a Bsharri native, became head of the Lebanese Forces (LF) militia (now a political party). Many LF militants were drawn from the town during the civil war.\n\nCulture\nToday, the town is located in a highly touristic zone including many attractions such as the Khalil Gibran Museum, the Kadisha Valley, the Kadisha Grotto, the Cedars of God forest and several ski resorts.\nBsharri is home to a Lebanese Red Cross First Aid Center, also to “The Maronite Scouts” that started their activities in early 2000.\nOn July 13, 2018, International Colombian singer of Lebanese heritage, Shakira, performed in Bsharri during the Cedars International Festival in the presence of 13,000 people. The visit was a part of her 2018 world tour, the El Dorado World Tour.\nOn March 22, 2019, The municipalities of Bsharri, Lebanon, and Val d’Isère, France inked an agreement to promote cultural exchange between the two towns. The cultural exchange program aims to build bridges for French and Lebanese youth that want to experience the unique cultural relationship and similarities the two countries possess. The mayor of Val d’Isère, Marc Bauer, led a French delegation to Lebanon to inaugurate a program aimed at promoting cultural and athletic exchange between the two famous ski locations.\nAndrea Bocelli performed at the opening ceremony of The Cedars International Festival-Bsharri (CIF) before an audience of 8,000 people. Before the festival, Bocelli visited the Cedars of God, where he was received by the head of the Lebanese Forces Party, Samir Geagea.\nBsharri natives are also known for their strong Christian faith. Throughout the year, many religious festivities and commemorations take place in the town, attracting thousands from neighbouring villages.\n\nCedars ski resort\nThe Cedars resort is located in the North of Lebanon. Skiers came to the resort as early as 1920, and have been returning there ever since. The first lift was installed by the government in 1953.\nThe Cedars resort has a slightly longer season than the others, sometimes beginning early November and often lasting until late April. Pisted and off-piste skiing is possible, as well as Nordic skiing and skidoo rides. In summer 2005, The Cedars resort installed three new chairlifts to replace the old T-bars and extend the ski runs. Fifteen million US Dollars have lately been invested to upgrade the facilities and raise the standard of the resort's accommodation, equipment, safety and services.\nAn ongoing project envisages a gondola that would carry skiers and visitors from the parking level at 2,095 metres (6,873 ft) to the highest accessible summit of 2,870 metres (9,420 ft). There is no indication yet of when and whether this will be finalized. To comply with international regulations, a refuge with a capacity of 400 persons also needs be built at the top of the gondola, and equipped with telescopes allowing vistas as far away as the island of Cyprus.\n\nGeography\nClimate\nBsharri has a continental Mediterranean climate (Csb/Dsb, according to the Köppen climate classification), with dry and mild summers and cold, snowy winters. Temperatures in the summer can go above 30 °C (86 °F) a few times per year. On the other hand, temperatures can fall occasionally to −15 °C (5 °F) and on Bsharri mountain to −30 °C (−22 °F) during the winter. Heavy snowfall is observed every year and accumulations of over 2 m (80 in) and on  Bsharri mountain of 7 m (280 in) are not unheard of.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Christians made up 99.41% of registered voters in Bsharri. 94.52% of the voters were Maronite Catholics.\n\nGallery\nNotable residents\nKhalil Gibran (1883-1931), writer, poet and visual artist\nAntoine Choueiri (1939-2010), media executive\nSamir Geagea (born 1952), head of the Lebanese Forces party\n\nSee also\nDimane\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nLebanese Embassy (US) Section on Bsharri\nWorld66",

The islands were also identified as a Ramsar Wetland of Special International Importance in 1980, and have been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International. The islands are a haven for endangered green turtles (Chelona mydas), rare monk seals and a resting and nesting grounds for migratory birds.\n\nIslands\nThe largest of the three islands is Palm Island (Arabic: جزيرة النخيل Jazeerat an-Nakheel) also known as Rabbits Island (Arabic: جزيرة الأرانب Jazeerat al-Araneb). The name 'Araneb' (rabbits) comes from the great numbers of rabbits that were raised on the island during the time of the French mandate early in the 20th century.\nPalm Island is characterized by its flat terrain and has no obvious reliefs, it covers an area of 180,796 square metres (1,946,070 sq ft). The island's highest point is at 6 metres (20 ft) above sea level. It's rocky shoreline extends from the northwest to south while its sandy beaches lay at the northern and eastern faces. The middle of the island is earthen, it contains evidence of past periods of human occupation such as a fresh water well, an old salt evaporation pond and the remains of a Crusader church. The island underwent rehabilitation works which included restoration of the well, its water is used to irrigate the island's 570 palm trees. The authorities also constructed a boat dock and walking trails and demarcated the island's areas of recreation and research.\nSanani Island (Arabic: جزيرة السناني Jazeerat as-Sanani) covers an area of 45,503 square metres (489,790 sq ft) south east of Palm Island. It is mainly rocky with a partially sandy shore.\nRamkine Island (Arabic: جزيرة رمكين Jazeerat Ramkine) also known as Fanar Island (Arabic: جزيرة الفنار Jazeerat al-Fanar) is the smallest of the islands with an area of 34,903 square metres (375,690 sq ft); it is located north west of Palm Island.  Ramkine island is mostly rocky and rises to about 12 meters above sea level. The island contains the remains of a lighthouse in addition to cannon emplacements and underground galleries that were built in the early 20th century. A solar powered navigation light has now been installed in the tower of the old lighthouse.\n\nThe islands are public property, they were declared protected area by law on March 9, 1992.\n\nHistory\nThe islands hosted an important settlement as attested by the presence of numerous ostraca dating to the late Roman and medieval periods as well as several rock-cut cisterns. The first excavation of Palm Island was undertaken in October 1973 and revealed the foundations of several buildings dating to the Crusades in which earlier architectural elements, such as column drums and fragments of capitals had been re-used.\nAmong the medieval sources that make mention of the offshore isles of Tripoli is the Arab geographer Idrisi who visited the city during the twelfth century at the time when it was ruled by Raymond III; Idrisi wrote:\n\nOpposite the city of Tripoli are four islands in a row. The first of them,\nand nearest to the land, is the Narcissus Isle (an -Narjis); it is very small and\nis unoccupied. Then comes the Isle of the Column (al-tantid), then Monk’s Isle\n(ArRahib), and then the Isle of Ardhakun (or Udhákun). \nThe Crusaders built a church upon the largest island. It was there that Alice of Champagne, the widow of Hugh I of Cyprus came in 1224 to marry Bohemond V of Antioch. The royal wedding took place in this church which we are told by Arab chroniclers was dedicated to Thomas the Apostle. Years later the island became the scene of a bloody massacre; when the Mamelukes entered Tripoli in 1289 the panic-stricken inhabitants fled to the port and crossed over to the island. Many took refuge in the church where they were put to death when the Mamelukes caught up with them.  The island was afterwards abandoned for many years.\nAt present the Palm Islands are managed and monitored daily by the Mina City Environment Protection Committee and its team with two rangers keeping intruders at bay. The islands were first open to the public in 1999. The islands are only open to the public between July and September though they may be closed during this period if environmental work or studies are being undertaken. Ferries, operated by local fishermen, assure the transport of visitors from the Mina ports to the Islands.\n\nGeology and pedology\nThere are two theories regarding the geological origins of the islands bedrock, the rocky basement of the islands is mainly horizontally bedded marine limestone, it was interpreted as Miocene deposits. However, since no tectonic features are visible in the limestone to distinguish it from the Miocene limestone of the Lebanese mainland, with the lack of fossil evidence, and with its regular sedimentation, this limestone could be interpreted to be more likely from the Plio-Quaternary age.\nGeomorphologically, marine and emerged aerial erosion give the limestone its typical karstic features. Open gutters can be seen, wide and open in the case of marine erosion, narrower in higher places due to aerial and marine erosion. All around the islands there are bare rocky exposures as a result of marine erosion in the form of dissolution and physical action of the waves.\nDuring the winter diaclases and pools within the dunes fill with fresh water which remains available even in the summer.\nThe sandy shore and dunes of two of the islands are of a biological origin. It is mostly constituted by the skeletons of marine foraminifera, resulting in very light sand mixed with fragments of gastropod shells and parts of skeletons and spines of echinoderms. Sand dunes form the higher parts of Palm Island and are the location of evidence of human occupation.\nOrthent, is found on the rocky parts of the islands; this exceedingly shallow soil hosts ephemeral flora that grows during the wet seasons and when fresh water accumulate in the rocky crevasses. Soils with more horizon development are found in the western parts of Palm Island, it is mainly formed by aeolian and beach deposited calcareous sand.\n\nThreats\nThe 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah during which there was a large oil spill caused by the Israeli bombing of the Lebanese Jiyyeh power plant disturbed the fragile ecosystem of the reserve. Oil coated the islands shores killing microorganism and algae which are crucial food source for marine life and sea turtles. Oil also spread across the surface of the water, presenting a danger to both turtles and migrating birds. Large quantities of oil, sunk down to the sea bed endangering aquatic life. A clean-up and monitoring program undertaken by the World Conservation Union mission to Lebanon aimed to minimize the damage to the Palm islands.",

Tannourine has a population of approximately 25,000.\nTannourine extends between the municipal borders of Douma and Yammoune, and between Aqoura to the south and Bsharri and Hadath El Jebbeh to the north. The town is close to the Kadisha Valley and Cedars of God UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Afqa grotto, the Baatara sinkhole, and the Nahr Ibrahim valley.\nTannourine lies in a collection of valleys and ravines accessible either from Douma, Kfour Al Arbe, a backroad from Bsharri or from a newly constructed highway direct from Batroun, or from Laqlouq.\n\nEtymology\nTannourine is the plural of the Syriac word tannour, which indicates an old stone oven. Tannourine's name may in fact stem from the local topography, which resembles the convex form of an oven called tannour, with the dual suffix ine as a reference to the two distinct areas of Tannourine Al-Tahta (literally Lower Tannourine) and Tannourine Al-Fawqa (literally Upper Tannourine).\n\nClimate\nTannourine Cedar Reserve\nThe village also shares its name with Tannourine Cedar Forest Nature Reserve, a cedar forest of some 1,000,000 trees.

The Tannourine Cedars Forest Nature Reserve is considered the largest and densest cedar forests in Lebanon, with ninety percent of the trees in the forest being cedar trees. Other companion trees like Cupressus, Pinus, Abies, Populus and others constitute a very rich ecosystem in planter species. The fauna ranges from the various types of birds (eagles, owls, robins, etc...) to wild animals (hyenas, boars, squirrels, snakes and bats).\nThe reserve includes cliffs and caves, and its mountainous landscape is astonishing with cedars growing on extremely vertical slopes. These cedars can be seen along the road that goes north to Hadath al-Jebbeh, which, although in poor condition, winds its way through wild and isolated scenery up to the Kadisha Valley gorge, leading to Bsharri.\nDuring the Lebanese war (1975-1990) land mines were spread in some parts of the forest, making it mostly inaccessible by the local communities and their herds. This ended-up protecting the forest: it was left relatively un-touched until a law dated 20/2/1999 established it as a protected area. The Lebanese Army cleared the forest of land mines. The reserve is now open to the public and hosts \"Tannourine Cedars Night\" an annual summer music festival.\n\nVillages and local attractions\nThe Village of Balaa (bordering Laqlouq) is known for its deep natural sink hole. A 300-meter walk brings you to a dizzying open cavern some 250 meters deep. Three natural bridges - of which the middle one is the most spectacular - complete the scene. In the spring, snow melt water forms the scenic 90m high Baatara gorge waterfall.\nThe Nahr-Al-Joze (the Joze being a species of trout that grows in the valley river) meanders through the valley and borders a number of restaurants, and creates a forest ecosystem higher up towards the source. Likewise, the river has formed a number of natural pools of clear water that can be explored higher up towards the source.\nTannourine is well known for its ancient Maronite monasteries; specifically the convents of Saint Shallitah and Saint Antonios Houb, the latter being located in the village of Wata Houb.\nAlso, among the rocky outcrops of Tannourine al-Tahta is located an ancient 500-year-old Lebanese house, believed to be one of the earliest examples of Lebanese architecture. That same house was on the cover of a National Geographic report on Lebanon. Until late 2008, the occupant of the house was the oldest living man in Lebanon. Dubbed \"Massoud\", he was reputed to be 109 years old.\n\nChurches and monasteries\nIn the late fifth century AD, Tannourine became a refuge for the Maronites. Some of the churches and monasteries include:\n\nSaint Chalitta Church - an archeological site from the Crusader period.\nSaint Sarkis Church - a Byzantine archaeological site. It had three markets and the vestibule was paved with a mosaic. It was constructed near the new church.\nThe Church of the Assumption of Mary\nSaint Antonio monastery in Houb was built in 1749.\nSaint Peter church\nSaint Georges church\n\nArchaeological sites\nTannourine hosts a remarkably large number of monuments dating back to the Phoenician, Roman and Greek eras.\nIn the valley of Tannourine-Al-Tahta lies a nearly-intact Roman aqueduct and a decrepit reservoir and Roman Cistern at its side. It is a testament that the fertility of that valley was being exploited since at least the 1st century AD\nHigher up in the mountains, in the now abandoned village of Ain al-Raha, are found a number of 6th century and Crusader-era churches that many scholars believe to be one of the earliest known proofs of the presence of Christianity in the upper Levant. Indeed, according to the legend, Ain al-Raha (literally: source of relief) was during the 11th to 13th century a safe haven for defeated Crusaders.\nAlso, above the previously mentioned old Lebanese house is an abandoned monastery sheltered in the hollow cave on the face of the mountain. It is believed that the 16th century remains were constructed in a way that it melded into the mountain to create a \"camouflage\" of sorts; and indeed unless you intend to search for it, you'd be hard-pressed to locate it immediately. Such caution was employed in order to thwart Ottoman army which wished to seize the Levant, which they eventually succeeded in doing.\nIn Wata Houb there are inscriptions on a rock dating back to the eighth century BC, the statues of a huge man between two smaller ones.\nIn St. Anthony's monastery in Houb, the remains of a Phoenician temple are preserved. In 1936 the remains of a structure with an elaborate stone sculpture were found and a large font was used to save the blood of the victims. This is all in the middle of a paved opening with stone seats around. It was also found among the rubble, icons inscribed with the name of Alexander the Great and drawings of the god, Jupiter, carrying a lightning symbol in his right hand and a scepter in his left. The other read, \"Iskandar, the King and the God and the compassionate father\" in addition to the drawings of an eagle and the heads of a man and a woman with the words \" the 2 Gods are brothers.\" There are also writings glorifying the Roman Emperor Hadrian and other writings cautioning from cutting certain types of trees; in addition to pools, restrooms, and forts built to protect convoys from nomadic invasions. In Tannourine, there is today a Roman wall which marks the boundary between Tannourine and Aqoura.\nThe Romans also built an observatory called Aytamout observatory, which was overlooking the neighboring areas to address those who come to cut the trees. The Greek monuments included icons of the goddess Isis, the goddess and protector of navigation. She has two horns and she is carrying in her hand an Ankh with Greek letters of \"Byblos\".\n\nHistory\nTannourine was inhabited since the Phoenician and Roman times. However, there is no conclusive evidence that it was a continuous presence or a discontinued one. Nor is there any evidence to prove whether this presence left an impact biologically and genetically on other people who came later to Tannourine. Based on the manuscript from the 17th century of Father Peter Matar in 1650 and the manuscript from the late 16th century of Father Al Maadi in 1599, several families lived in Tannourine in the thirteenth century, before the Mamluks attack on Mount Lebanon. The most prominent of these families are Matar (مطر ), Ghoch (غوش), Chamoun (شمعون), Harik (حريق), Sadka (صدقه) and Laya (لايا), Chaiban (شيبان). \nBetween 1268 and 1306 the Mamluks attacked Mount Lebanon in a \"discipline\" campaign in the region. Many of these families dispersed, some of which were killed, and others emigrated and some hid in the many caves in the area of Tannourine.\nThe families that did not become extinct at that stage are Ghoch, Matar and Reaidy (Reaidy family is a branch from Al Matar family), as many of their descendants are still in Tannourine region.\nAs for the rest of the families that are currently stationed in Tannourine, most of them are the descendant of Gerges Abi Korkmaz the third, the actual Grandfather of more than 60% of the current people of tannourine.\nAl Korkmaz main families are: Harb, Youness, Tarabay, Dagher, Yaacoub. It is worth mentioning that these families have branched into several families and names which are too many to state.↵\nFor the true origins of the Korkmaz the first, there are many stories. Some historians consider him from Slavic ethnic origins, Albanians. Turkish, or Baghdadian origins and that he was called khattar, and khattar means in the Arabic language, the \"Spear holder\". Also, Korkmaz means in the Turkish language \"Fearless\"↵.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, many citizens of Tannourine travelled to Brazil fleeing the war, many were sent to the city of Araçuai - MG, where they received the last name Tanure, Tanuri, Tanury, Tannure, Tannouri and Tannoury.\nTannourine includes many families who came from several Lebanese villages and towns, such as:\n-Bkassini from Bkassine\n-Mrad from Kfar Selouan\n-Al Chaer\n-Koumeir, Bou Abdo and Hashem from Aqoura\n-Karam and El Hasrouni from Hasroun\n-Rashed and Makhlouf from Tartej\n-Faddoul from Bsharri\n-Akiki from Keserwan\n-Abi Khalil from Ain Ksour\n\nEconomy\nTannourine is the site of Tannourine Natural Spring Mineral Water.\n\nGovernment and demographics\nThe newly constructed Tannourine Municipality building is located in Tannourine-Al-Fawqa, overlooking the town previously mentioned. A President of the Municipal Council is elected every 6 years along with a \"list\" of 18 cabinet members who are all subjected to a vote by the residents. It has relative administrative and financial independence but remains under the control, supervision and financing of the central government.\n\nReligion\nAs of 2022, the religious make-up of the  town's 6,391 registered voters were roughly 92.3% Maronite Catholics, 3.8% Greek Orthodox, 1.5% Greek Catholic, 0.6% Christian Minorities, and 1.8% others.\n\nNotable people\nAssia Dagher (1908–1986), actress and film producer\nJulio Cesar Turbay (1916–2005), former president of Colombia in 1978\nBoutros Harb (born 1944), politician\nCharbel Dagher (born 1950), Lebanese academic\nClaude Comair (born 1958), co-founder of Nintendo Software Technology\nPierre Dagher (born 1963), Lebanese actor and voice actor\nShakira (born 1977), singer\nHer paternal grandmother is from Tannourine, which Shakira visited in 2018.

          "content": "Ehden (Arabic: إِهْدِن, Syriac-Aramaic:ܐܗܕ ܢ) is a mountainous city in the heart of the northern mountains of Lebanon and on the southwestern slopes of Mount Makmal in the Mount Lebanon Range. Its residents are the people of Zgharta, as it is within the Zgharta District.\n\nGeography\nThe mountain town is located 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) above sea level, and is 30.8 kilometres (19.1 mi) from Zgharta, 110 kilometres (68 mi) from Beirut (the country’s capital) and 39 kilometres (24 mi) from Tripoli, Lebanon.\nEhden is a famous summer resort and touristic center, often called \"The Bride of Summer Resorts in the North of Lebanon.\"\nGastronomy is one of the most prominent tourist attractions in Ehden, especially in summer. Kebbeh meshwyeh (krass) and the kebbeh nayyeh, both traditional dishes, and particularly notable in this town.\n\nEtymology\nEhden is derived from Aramaic, meaning \"the mountain’s base and slope\". The location of Ehden at the base of Mar Sarkis Mountain supports this explanation. This view is supported by Anis Freiha who writes:The name of Ehden comes from Adon, Adonis meaning \"power, stability and tranquillity\". It is corroborated by the Arabic root Hdn meaning \"steadiness, calm and fertility\". Adon means also \"the base and the mountaintop\" translating into \"top of the mountain and its base\".\nPatriarch Estephan El Douaihy, along with Father Martens the Jesuit, lean toward the conclusion that Ehden’s name is derived from Eden where Adam and Eve lived following their exit from paradise. Douaihy left a booklet in Latin regarding his point of view. It is kept in the Vatican Library. Orientalists Hawiet, Rose Goaler and Orkwart supported Douaihy and Martens’ viewpoint. It was contested by Ernest Renan in his book Mission en Phenicie and by Father Henri Lammens.\n\nLocation, climate and nature\nEhden is located in the central northern side of Mount Lebanon, with a 1500-metre (at Midan square) elevation from sea level. It is 120 kilometres (75 mi) from Beirut, 30 kilometres (19 mi) from Tripoli and 25 kilometres (16 mi) from Zgharta. Ehden used to be the sole residence for Zghartians prior to the establishment of Zgharta. It is known for its dry climate, water and forest. It is a renowned summer location, famous for its setting on the Mar Sarkis (Saint Sarkis) Mountain overlooking coastal towns and villages as far as Akkar to Shikka. A large number of local and overseas tourists visit Ehden annually.\n\nHistory\nEhden’s history dates back into the BC period. Its indigenous people transformed rocky hills into land suitable for crops, irrigated by water from mountain streams.  The people of Ehden have contributed to the fields of thought, literature, patriotism, and religion in Lebanon.\nEhden was the original homeland for Zghartians who later established Zgharta on the Lebanese coast in the 16th century. It was/is a warmer winter season home below the mountains' snow. Four centuries later it has become primarily a summer resort.\nDespite the changes that have taken place over the centuries, Ehden's people have maintained their strong ties to their cultural heritage and history. The town continues to be a vibrant hub of creativity, thought, and spirituality, making it an important destination for anyone interested in Lebanon's rich cultural heritage.\n\nBC Ehden\nSome early texts mention that the people of Ehden are descendants of the tribe of Shem, the son of Noah.\n- 850 BC: the Aramean king Hadadezer came to Ehden and rebuilt it, hoisting a statue of its god known then as “Baal Loubnan” or “The god of snow”\n- 700 BC: Sennacherib, the Assyrian king through his leading assistant Rabshakeh, occupied Ehden and destroyed it by setting it alight and overturning its statue.\n- 300 BC: Seleucus I, leader of an army that was a part of Alexander the Great's Macedonian army, rebuilt Ehden. Seleucus I also built a large pagan temple on the eastern side where he erected a statue of the Sun-god Helios.\n- 64 BC: Pompey blockaded Ehden. He conquered and destroyed it.\n\nAD Ehden\nAn Ancient Greek inscription was found on the exterior of Mar Mama church with the equivalent date 282 AD and also Greek numerals near the church.\nAlso a Syriac inscription was found which has been translated as saying “In the name of God who is capable of resurrecting the dead. In the year one of Alexander … Marcos had lived and died.”\nAt the end of the 6th century Ehdenians converted to Christianity. Maronite priests of Saint Maroun and St. Simeon Stylites helped convert them into Maronites. They built five churches all at once on top of the ruined idolatrous temple, using its stones for building Mar Mama, Mar Boutros, Mar Youhana, Mar Ghaleb and Mar Istfan. In addition, they raised huge stone crosses on top of the mountain.\nA brief account of Ehden's history has been found written by one of its inhabitants who fled from the Mamluk invasion in 1283, tying the manuscript to his chest for safekeeping.\n\nManuscript\nFather George Yammine found the manuscript, which was written on an old piece of leather, at the start of the 19th century in a priest's home in Bsharri. He copied it and, following his death, his son Sheikh Roumanos Yammine kept it. It was then passed onto Monsignor Hanna Dib Saydet. In 1930, Historian Semaan el Khazan discovered a copy of that document with another historian, Father Youhana Maroun Farah el Seb'ali, who had copied it from Monsignor Saade in 1904. It says:\n\n\"Ehden is a very old village located in the north of Mount Lebanon. It used to be known as 'Patchilassar' a Persian pronunciation meaning 'the paradise of the area'. It is enriched with fresh water, trees and a breathtaking water stream called Mar Sarkis bursts off its eastern mountain. A tribe related to Sam, son of Noah settled in Ehden, which later became a famous site.\"\nIn 1264 the people of Ehden supported the Crusades in their battle for the town of Tripoli.\nIn 1283 the army of the Mamluk Sultan Qalawun invaded Mount Lebanon and burnt Ehden.\nIn 1586, Ehden was burnt again according to a found manuscript but it does not mention by whom, all it says that \"Ehden was burnt in the year 1897 of the Greek calendar\" which means the year 1586 AD.\nIn 1610 the first printing press in the Middle East was set up St Anthony of Khozaya Abbey near Ehden. Early publishing was mostly of religious works in Syriac (Karchouni) characters. The printing press is still on display there.\n\nEhden's ancient ruins\nEhden used to be a significant site for idolatrous beliefs where numerous temples and enormous statues were located such as “Baal Loubnan”, “god of snow” and “god of the sun”.\nDue to major destruction that engulfed Ehden throughout its history, most of those statues and temples were destroyed. Huge rocks that have remained scattered on mountaintops, as well as large stones used in building some of its churches, still leave indication of that era.\nFather La Monse the Jesuit stated that there are three scriptures in Mar Mama church, two are written in Greek and another in Syriac.\nThe Greek writing is sited on its exterior garden wall where most of it has been erased through the passing of time. Two lines are still visible in the lower section. A date is also visible of the Alexander year 584, which is equivalent to 282 AD. The second writing is in the shape of Greek numbers written on a gravesite next to the church, but could hardly be recognized. As for the Syriac writing, “Rinan” translated the remainder of its meaning in his book titled “Phoenician Mission” as follows:\n\n“In the name of God who is capable of resurrecting the dead. In the year one of Alexander …. Marcos had lived and died.”\nThere is also a historical writing, which was transferred to France and is preserved in its Paris museum in the Orient section, numbered 4524 and dated 272 AD.\nDr. Philip Hitti in his book Lebanon in History affirms that “Ruins dating back to the era of the Roman Empire are widely spread over the mountains. Statues carved on rocks, in addition to Greek and Roman sculptures, graves, temple ruins and buried columns were found in branched and distant villages like Chouslan, Kartaba, Akoura, Tanourin and Ehden.”\nEhden’s most famous Christian site is “Dayr al-Salib” (Convent of the Cross), which is a symbol of an era of transformation for Ehdenians who had turned away from idolatry and converted to Christianity, according to a historical document written by Father Kozma. This convent is situated between Ehden and Bkoufa in the versant of Mar Sarkis’ mountain. It is a large grotto containing an altar and was identified by large stones forming a cross that was placed on top of its entrance, but vanished in 1935. Nevertheless, Al-Semaani wrote in his book The Eastern Library that he witnessed those cross-engraved stones in Hassroun, Bsharri, Ehden and Aytou.\nMar Mama church, which was built in 748, is considered as one of the oldest Maronite churches in Lebanon. Father La Monse described it as “an eighth-century church built over a destroyed Byzantine church (sixth century) which was in turn built over an old Canaanite temple.” Mar Youhana church was built in 779 but was ruined. Some of its huge stones were still around until the start of the 20th century. Two churches belonging to Mar Sarkis convent were built, the first in the 8th century and the other in the 12th.\nNames of some areas hold a historical meaning such as “Al-Baoul area” named after (Baal the God), “Bab al-Bowayb” meaning (The Door of Doors) for it leads to the kingdom of “Afka” in Ehden’s forest. Afka is the first holy city in history according to Father Dr. Youssef Yammine al-Ehdeni who is trying to prove this theory by embarking on historical research he has not as yet completed.\n\nPresent day\nNowadays the people reside in their Ehden homes during the summer months for cooler days and in their Zgharta homes for warmer winters. A popular saying  based on this moving between homes is “We cross ourselves and then move down and we celebrate and then move up.” This annual migration coincides with the Raising of the Cross Day, 15 September, and around Easter time.\nEhden is a beautiful city renowned for its healthy environment, moderate dry climate and natural fresh water. It is one of the main summer locations of Lebanon.\nVisitors reach Ehden travelling from Beirut through Tripoli, Zgharta, Arjes then Ehden, or from Beirut through Seika, Al-Koura, Seraal, then Ehden, or from Beirut through Baalbak, Al-Arz-Becharri, Kfersghab, then Ehden. There are many restaurants in Ehden. Most restaurants are located near Mar Sarkis water stream, Al-Dawalib, Horsh Ehden and Al-Middan. Al-Middan is well known for its cafés, sweet shops and entertainment. Annual folkloric festivals are held on Al-Middan. Many tourists and visitors who attend Al-Middan ultimately visit Mar Gerges Cathedral, the coffin of Youssef Bey Karam and his statue on “Al-Ketla”, and the statue of Al-Sahyouni and Sheikh Asaad Boulos Gravesite.\nMany cafés can be found in “Al-Moghtaribin” (Immigrants) Street and “Al-Mattal” area, creating an atmosphere of celebration lasting all over Ehden summer attracting tourists and visitors from Lebanon and the world.\nConcerts featuring stars of Lebanese and Arab singing are held almost nightly. First-class hotels and resorts are available for tourists. In addition to modern motels, bars and clubs.\nEhden has experienced a building boom in recent times extending beyond its traditional precincts where modern villas and apartments were built. New roads have been developed and old ones were widened to cope with increasing traffic.\nConvenience and tourism services for comfortable living are widely available in Ehden. There are various shopping centres, speciality shops, health services provided in a public hospital operating throughout the year, plus medical surgeries, chemists, official centres, post and phone centre, summer schools.\nEhden is a site for art events such as hosting cultural and art galleries, stage theatre, open air plays, lectures and forums held by Zghartians and Lebanese thinkers and intellectuals.\n\nPlaces of worship\nThe early churches\nThe earliest churches in Ehden are those built over the  site of a pagan temple.\nA large pagan temple was built by Seleucus a commander in Alexander the Great’s army and raised a statue of \"The god of Sun\" nearby. The temple and statue were destroyed in 60 BC by the Roman Commander Pompey. Following their conversion to Christianity the people of Ehden built from the stones of the destroyed temple five churches over the temple precincts as a symbol of Christianity’s victory over paganism.\nThe churches from North to South are:\n\nSt Peter's.\nSt John’s. The church no longer exists but was located near the statue of Patriarch Stephane Doueihi.\nSt Ghaleb's. Originally called St Zakhia's meaning in Syriac \"Victor\". This church was near the corner above St Mama's. The building no longer exists.\nMar Mama church. The oldest Maronite church in Lebanon.\nSt Estephan's. Named after the first Christian martyr. This church, which no longer exists, was located a few metres where the present Mar Mama church stands.\nThe area surrounding St Peter's church was originally the large public square of the pagan temple where the ancient Ehdenians used to meet during feasts and religious ceremonies. They used to sacrifice their eldest sons to their then pagan god for the wellbeing of their families and people. Of course, this was forbidden by God's word: Lev. 18:21 says, \"Neither shall you give any of your offspring to offer them to Molech, nor shall you profane the name of your God; I am the Lord.\"  (See also Lev. 18:21; 20:2-5; 2 Kings. 23:10; Jer. 32:35). The blood of those sacrificed used to accumulate in the temple square and then streamed through a stone canal to where the five churches were built. There was a well, which collected the blood near where St Ghaleb’s  church stood.\n\nChurches today\nThere are 23 places of Christian worship in Ehden, including churches, monasteries, convents and shrines, such as:\nCathedrals\n\nCathedral of Saint George\nChurches\n\nChurch of Our Lady of Al-Hara\nChurch of Our Lady of Jou’it\nChurch of Our Lady of the Fort, built over the remains of a Crusader castle at the highest point of Ehden\nChurch of Saint Abda\nChurch of Saint Anthony\nChurch of Saint Stephen\nChurch of Saint Ghaleb\nChurch of Saint George\nChurch of Saint John\nChurch of Saint Mary and Saint Ibhay the Syriac\nChurch of Saint Mamas Church, which was built in 749 A.D. and is one of the oldest Maronite churches in Lebanon;\nChurch of Saint Michael\nChurch of Saint Simon\nChurch of Saint Charbel inaugurated in 2023, it is the newest and biggest church in Ehden, located at the town's entrance.\nConvents\n\nConvent of Saint Cyprianus\nConvent of Saint Jacob\nConvent of Saint Moura hus\nConvent of Saint Paul\nMonastery of Mar Sarkis, Ras Al Nahr, Ehden\nConvent of the Holy Cross\n\nEnvironment\nThe town is also home to the Ehden Forest, with a variety of trees, plants, flowers, and rare animals. The forest was declared a protected nature reserve by the Lebanese government in 1992.\nEhden’s forest is on the northeast side of Ehden and is an area of 3000 hectares, with a 1300- to 2000-metre elevation from sea level. The approximate elevation is 1893 metres at Al-Jafieh, 1550 metres at Ayn Naasah and 1440 metres at Ayn al-Baq valley. The forest embraces a vital natural forestry reserve with a variety of 40 different types of native plants such as cedars, fir, pine, elm and many others. In addition, 400 different distinctive plants have been identified, of which 66 grow only in Lebanon, and 11 are endemic to Ehden.\nSome of Ehden’s distinctive plants are:\n\nStripirtps libanotica, discovered by botanist and scientist La Plader in 1758\nDianthus karami,  discovered in 1870 by botanist Le Blanche who named it in honour of Youssef Bey Karam.\n“Flower of Ehden’s forest” (Zahret Horsh Ehden)\nCotsina libanotica, a thorny plant.\n“The tooth of the Lebanese tiger” (Sin al-Asad al-Loubnani)\nDistinctive trees include:\n\nWild apple trees\n“Al-Derdar”, an elm tree with only four trees of its type left in Lebanon.\nAbies cilicica: Ehden’s forest is the southernmost site for this fir, as noted in the World Natural Plantation demographic maps.\n\nSee also\nZgharta\nEhden massacre\nYoussef Bey Karam\nYoussef Salim Karam\nSalim Bey Karam\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nEhden On Google Maps Street View By Paul Saad\nEhden Zgharta Parish\nYoussef Bey Karam Foundation Archived 2014-02-12 at the Wayback Machine\nEhden Family Tree",

          "content": "Zgharta (Arabic: زغرتا, Classical Syriac: ܙܓܪܬܐ), also spelled Zghorta, is a city in North Lebanon, with an estimated population of around 50,000. It is the second biggest city in Northern Lebanon after Tripoli. Zgharta is officially the Zgharta-Ehden municipality.\nZgharta is about 150 metres above sea level and lies between the rivers of Jouit and Rashein. It is 23 kilometres from Ehden, 11 kilometres from the coastal city of Tripoli, 88.7 kilometres from the capital of Lebanon, Beirut, and 82 kilometres from the nearest Syrian city, Tartous. Its history and people are closely associated with the village of Ehden, a summer resort and touristic center. Most of the citizens of Zgharta have summer houses in Ehden.\nIt is the seat and the capital of the Zgharta District (Qadaa' Zgharta). Zgharta is closely related to the mountain town of Ehden, essentially sharing the same population. Each summer, most of the people in Zgharta move to spend their summer in Ehden; this is reversed in winter when Ehden is practically deserted.\nZgharta had two Presidents of Lebanon: Suleiman Frangieh and René Moawad, and many prominent politicians: Youssef Salim Karam, Hamid Frangieh, historian Jawad Boulos Makary, Semaan El Douaihy, Suleiman Frangieh Jr, Nayla Moawad, Estephan El Douaihy (ex-MP), Salim Bey Karam, Tony Frangieh (current MP), Jawad Boulos, Michel Moawad (current MP) and Youssef Bahha El Douaihy. Ehden also produced at least four patriarchs of the Maronite Church – Gregorios Of Ehden, David Of Ehden, Jeremiah of Amshit (1199-1230), Youhanna Makhlouf (1609-1633), George Omaira (1634-1644), Estephan El Douaihy (1670-1704) – and an Ottoman era nationalist leader Youssef Bey Karam who led a rebellion against Turkish rule. Political power in Zgharta district is dominated by a few rival families from the town: the Karam, Frangieh, Douaihy, Moawad and Makary.\nTraditionally, agriculture was a large portion of the local economy, with olives grown for olive-oil around Zgharta and apple orchards around Ehden. Recently, the service (especially tourism and leisure) and manufacturing sectors have seen significant growth.\n\nEtymology\nVarious explanations have been given as to the meaning of Zgharta. The majority are of the opinion that it relates to meanings relating to fortresses, citadels, barricades and the like. One writer has suggested that it derived from the Aramaic word \"zaghar\" meaning fortress.\n\nHistory\nAncient history\nThe Plain of Zgharta around Zgharta was likely inhabited from at least the beginning of the Neolithic Revolution by the Qaraoun culture as evidenced by some large, heavy Neolithic flints and double-headed axes found in the area that are documented by R. Wetzel and J. Haller in 1945.\nThere is some evidence that the area of Zgharta was later inhabited in 200 BC and that in the 2nd and 3rd centuries there were already fortifications. Its present-day existence and its close association with the village of Ehden began in the 16th century.\n\nThe founding of modern Zgharta\nThe story of that beginning is recorded in a manuscript in the Syriac language, which belonged to Romanos Afandi Yammine, son of Father George Yammine, and is now held by his grandson Youssef Boutros Romanos Yammine. It describes how people of Ehden had acquired \"the farmland of Zgharta\":\nOn the eve of the 24th of January 1515, Al-Ghazali, the governor of Damascus, along with Sinan Pasha, the minister of Sultan Selim I, had reached Ehden travelling along the route of Damascus-Bekaa Valley-Dahr al-Kadib-the cedars. They were transporting funds to Sultan Salim I who was in Egypt. They were welcomed as guests by Sheikh Iskandar, whilst other members of their travelling entourage were guests of the people of Ehden. Heavy snowfall and extremely freezing conditions that lasted two full days prompted them to stay five days in Ehden where Sheikh Iskandar and Bishop Keryakos Douaihy, the local bishop, provided for their guests great hospitality, generosity and kindness. Responding to a request by their guests, the people of Ehden endeavoured to clear the heavy snow off the road as far as Hayrouna Valley overlooking the coast, accompanying their guests to safety where they made their farewells to them with fitting accolades.\nIn April 1516, Bishop El Douaihy and Sheikh Iskandar received a letter from Al-Ghazali, saying on being told by his minister, Sinan Pasha of their and peoples hospitality and assistance, Sultan Salim I asked that he rewarded them which he promised the Sultan he would. On his return to Damascus, Al-Ghazali invited the people of Ehden to meet him in Tripoli.  At the request of Sheikh Iskander he agreed to provide the people with a place to live away from the harsh winter conditions, which they faced in Ehden. Al-Ghazali readily agreed to this request. Accompanied by his officials, Sheikh Iskandar went with Bishop El Douaihy to choose a suitable place in the Al-Zawiyi region. They chose a derelict farm, containing a few demolished houses and a tower in the middle, situated between the rivers Joueit and Rashein. Al-Ghazali, on the return of his officials with the measurements of the site, promised to obtain a \"Shahani firman\" (decree) from Sultan Salim whereby ownership of the land would pass to the people of Ehden.\nSome eight months later, in 1517, the \"Shahani firman\" was granted, but it was addressed to Sheikh Iskandar. Having collected the firman in Damascus and returning to Ehden the people there were aggrieved that the firman was addressed solely to Sheikh Iskandar, fearing that he and his relations could claim sole ownership. Bishop El Douaihy, representing the people, put this to Sheikh Iskandar and as a result he declared at the Mar Mama church that the given land known as \"Zgharta would be distributed equally between the people of Ehden\".\n\nLater history\nIn 1602, Father Ghodar, a Jesuit priest to Zgharta recorded:\n\"Zgharta represents a horrific nightmare for its enemy. Its youth is dressed in traditional clothing; white shirts decorated with yellow stitched embroidery, strongly tied \"sherwal\" pants along with long boots and topped by headband reflecting enormous heroism. Zgharta is a small village surrounded by an enclosure, and has a fortress beside the church of Virgin Mary. Zgharta used to be a drawn line between danger and worship, situated between Tripoli and the mountain. It would receive initial attacking strikes, then reply by returning those strikes, hitting the hearts of their enemy. Its people have therefore been renowned and recognised as excellent fighters\"\nAnother later visitor in 1831 records that \"From Tripoli I left for Zgharta, which is two hours away. Its land is full of olive, mulberry, vines, apricot and lemon trees\"\nThe town of Zgharta was divided into five sectors in 1932: Saydeh Sharki (the area to the east side of Notre-Dame of Zgharta church), Saydeh Gherbi (west of the Church), Slayeb Shemali (northern side of the crossroads), Slayeb Janoubi (southern side of the crossroads) and Maaser. To be a citizen of Zgharta, one is to be registered in one of these five sectors.\n\nAccent\nZghartaouis are instantly recognizable by their distinct accent. Zgharta, whose general population did not speak Arabic until the end of the 19th century, transferred some of the Syriac terminology as well as signs of movement and incorporated them into the Arabic language that they now speak due to the necessity of communicating with the rest of the residents of Mount Lebanon and its coast and those who abandoned this language. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the Saint Joseph School in Zgharta attested to this and the other schools in Ehden, which taught the Syriac language in addition to the Arabic and French languages. The prayers and Masses were held in Syriac and Arabic, before they gradually disappeared even among those in charge of the Maronite Church, who lost the books of Maronite prayers and Masses from its Syriac language until it became restricted to schools and seminaries and theological institutes.\nResidents of some villages in Mount Lebanon still speak Arabic with a Syriac accent, clinging to it and maintaining it because it is synonymous with their identity.\n\nEconomy\nThe main economy of Zgharta relies on agriculture, mainly through its surrounding villages through the sale of fruits of vegetables but most importantly through the production of olives and olive oil, which are exported. \nTourism also plays a big role in the city's economy, however this is mainly derived from tourism in Ehden, as Zgharta does not see many tourists. \nZgharta also has a small industrial sector, mainly through a couple of concrete plants and other industrial manufacturers.\n\nClimate\nThe climate is hot-summer Mediterranean (Csa in the Köppen climate classification), with very wet winters and very dry summers. About 1,053 mm (41.46 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nGeography\nZgharta is situated at an altitude of around 120m above sea level. The main and old city of Zgharta is situated between the two rivers of Rachiine and Jouit which merge forming the Abu Ali River which then passes through the city of Tripoli.  \nZgharta is situated at the steps of the Northern Mount Lebanon range in a not-too-hilly but very fertile agricultural area, mainly due to the rivers that flow through it. Olives, citrus fruits and lettuce were the main and historical crops grown in the area for centuries. Today, a variety of crops are grown: avocados, strawberries, kale, cabbage being the most popular.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, Christians made up 98.59% of registered voters in Zgharta. 91.79% of the voters were Maronite Catholics. \nMost people living in Zgharta are from the local Zghartawi families, but in the last 20 years, many Christians, mainly Maronites, originally from Danniyeh and Akkar have moved to Zgharta, and are settled in Mejdlaya and Kfarhata.\n\nNotable people\nIstifan al-Duwayhi\nTony Frangieh\nTony Frangieh Jr.\nHamid Frangieh\nMichael Cheika\nSuleiman Frangieh\nSamir Frangieh\nYoussef Barakat\nAdam Doueihi\nAntoine Al Douaihy (born 1999), footballer\nThomas George (Australian politician)\nSuleiman Frangieh\nOdette Kaddo\nFrangieh family\nYoussef Bey Karam\nYoussef Salim Karam\nSalim Bey Karam\nMarie al-Khazen\nMichel Moawad\nRene Mouawad\nJean Obeid\nJohn Symond\n\nSee also\nGigarta – Ancient settlement in North Lebanon\nEhden – City in Zgharta District, Lebanon\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nZgharta Ehden Municipality Archived 2021-05-07 at the Wayback Machine\nYoussef Bey Karam Foundation Archived 2021-02-26 at the Wayback Machine\nEhden Family Tree\nZgharta On Google Maps Street View By Paul Saad",

It covers an area of 6500 hectares, at an altitude ranging between 350 meters in the North-West and 1,700 meters to the South-East. Its main villages are: Yahchouch, Qahmez, Jouret el-Termos, Nahr ed Dahab, Ghbaleh, Ebreh, and Chouwan. Jabal Moussa and surrounding villages became part of the UNESCO Network of Biosphere Reserves under the Man and Biosphere (MAB) program in 2009. As part of the MAB program, JMBR addresses human livelihood improvement and nature conservation through combining natural sciences with social sciences, economics and education. \nThe Jabal Moussa mountain presents an exceptionally rich biodiversity, with more than 724 flora species, 25 mammal species, and more than 137 migratory and soaring birds species. In 2009, Jabal Moussa was designated a Globally Important Bird Area. Equally rich with cultural heritage, it portrays the interdependence of Man and Nature throughout history through various spiritual and historical sites dating back from the Phoenician, Roman, and Ottoman Periods.\n\nClimate\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, the reserve has a Mediterranean climate (Csa/Csb depending on the altitude), with mostly dry and warm summers and cool to cold, wet winters. The region's average annual rainfall is about 1350mm. The peaks of the Jabal Moussa mountain receive some intermittent snowfall during winter; however, the snowfall typically melts within a few days.\n\nArcheology\nPart of the UNESCO Network of Biosphere Reserves under the Man and Biosphere (MAB), Jabal Moussa, which has fifteen hiking trails including one called Hadrian’s Incline, named after the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who put up boundary markers around the cedar, oak, cypress, fir and juniper forests, and declared them his imperial domain; many of these inscriptions engraved on the rock survive today along with a network of Roman roads and stairs, built between 64 BC and AD 249. The largest archaeological site in the biosphere is called “Qornet el Deir” (translates to “the hill of the monastery”) and excavations done since 2017 have proven that the site was inhabited not only in the Roman Medieval eras, but its occupation goes back to the Bronze Age and the Phoenicians, who had a significant settlement that interconnected the Beqaa Valley and the coast.  In 2022, U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea inaugurated the Hinterland Archaeological Heritage Project in Jabal Moussa, which was funded by the U.S. Ambassadors' Fund for Cultural Preservation to conserve, study, and showcase the archaeological collection of Jabal Moussa while connecting the various archaeological sites of the biosphere reserve to one another.\n\nSee also\nAl Shouf Cedar Nature Reserve\nHorsh Ehden\nAammiq Wetland\nWorld Network of Biosphere Reserves in the Arab States",
