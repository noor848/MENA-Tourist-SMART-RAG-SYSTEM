      "content": "Cairo is the capital and largest city of Egypt and the Cairo Governorate, being home to more than 10 million people. It is also part of the largest urban agglomeration in Africa, the Arab world, and the Middle East. The Greater Cairo metropolitan area is one of the largest in the world by population with over 22 million people.\nThe area that would become Cairo was part of ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex and the ancient cities of Memphis and Heliopolis are near-by. Located near the Nile Delta, the predecessor settlement was Fustat following the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 next to an existing ancient Roman fortress, Babylon. Subsequently, Cairo was founded by the Fatimid dynasty in 969. It later superseded Fustat as the main urban centre during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods (12th–16th centuries).\nCairo has since become a longstanding centre of political and cultural life, and is titled \"the city of a thousand minarets\" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture. Cairo's historic center was awarded World Heritage Site status in 1979. Cairo is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification according to GaWC. The city is also a center of finance and commerce, academics and the arts, and is home to Cairo Symphony Orchestra and the Cairo Opera House, while the Academy of Arts provides visual arts education. Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industry in the Arab world, as well as Egypt's oldest institution of higher learning, Al-Azhar University. Many international media, businesses, and organisations have regional headquarters in Cairo. The Arab League has had its headquarters in Cairo for most of its existence.\nCairo, like many other megacities, suffers from high levels of pollution and traffic. The Cairo Metro, opened in 1987, is the oldest metro system in Africa, and ranks amongst the fifteen busiest in the world, with over 1 billion annual passenger rides. The economy of Cairo was ranked first in the Middle East in 2005, and 43rd globally on Foreign Policy's 2010 Global Cities Index.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of Cairo is derived from the Arabic al-Qāhirah (القاهرة), meaning 'the Vanquisher' or 'the Conqueror', given by the Fatimid Caliph al-Mu'izz following the establishment of the city as the capital of the Fatimid dynasty. Its full, formal name was al-Qāhirah al-Mu'izziyyah (القاهرة المعزيّة), meaning 'the Vanquisher of al-Mu'izz'. It is also supposedly due to the fact that the planet Mars, known in Arabic by names such as an-Najm al-Qāhir (النجم القاهر, 'the Conquering Star'), was rising at the time of the city's founding.\nEgyptians often refer to Cairo as Maṣr (IPA: [mɑsˤɾ]; مَصر), the Egyptian Arabic name for Egypt itself, emphasising the city's importance for the country.\nThere are a number of Coptic names for the city. Tikešrōmi (Coptic: Ϯⲕⲉϣⲣⲱⲙⲓ Late Coptic: [dikɑʃˈɾoːmi]) is attested in the 1211 text The Martyrdom of John of Phanijoit and is either a calque meaning 'man breaker' (Ϯ-, 'the', ⲕⲁϣ-, 'to break', and ⲣⲱⲙⲓ, 'man'), akin to Arabic al-Qāhirah, or a derivation from Arabic قَصْر الرُوم (qaṣr ar-rūm, \"the Roman castle\"), another name of Babylon Fortress in Old Cairo. The Arabic name is also calqued as ⲧⲡⲟⲗⲓⲥ ϯⲣⲉϥϭⲣⲟ, \"the victor city\" in the Coptic antiphonary.\nThe form Khairon (Coptic: ⲭⲁⲓⲣⲟⲛ) is attested in the modern Coptic text Ⲡⲓⲫⲓⲣⲓ ⲛ̀ⲧⲉ ϯⲁⲅⲓⲁ ⲙ̀ⲙⲏⲓ Ⲃⲉⲣⲏⲛⲁ (The Tale of Saint Verina). Lioui (Ⲗⲓⲟⲩⲓ Late Coptic: [lɪˈjuːj]) or Elioui (Ⲉⲗⲓⲟⲩⲓ Late Coptic: [ælˈjuːj]) is another name which is descended from the Greek name of Heliopolis (Ήλιούπολις). Some argue that Mistram (Ⲙⲓⲥⲧⲣⲁⲙ Late Coptic: [ˈmɪstəɾɑm]) or Nistram (Ⲛⲓⲥⲧⲣⲁⲙ Late Coptic: [ˈnɪstəɾɑm]) is another Coptic name for Cairo, although others think that it is rather a name for the Abbasid province capital al-Askar. Ⲕⲁϩⲓⲣⲏ (Kahi•ree) is a popular modern rendering of an Arabic name (others being Ⲕⲁⲓⲣⲟⲛ [Kairon] and Ⲕⲁϩⲓⲣⲁ [Kahira]) which is modern folk etymology meaning 'land of sun'. Some argue that it was  the name of an Egyptian settlement upon which Cairo was built, but it is rather doubtful as this name is not attested in any Hieroglyphic or Demotic source, although some researchers, like Paul Casanova, view it as a legitimate theory. Cairo is also referred to as Ⲭⲏⲙⲓ (Late Coptic: [ˈkɪmi]) or Ⲅⲩⲡⲧⲟⲥ (Late Coptic: [ˈɡɪpdos]), which means Egypt in Coptic, the same way it is referred to in Egyptian Arabic.\nSometimes the city is informally referred to as Cairo by people from Alexandria (IPA: [ˈkæjɾo]; Egyptian Arabic: كايرو).\n\nHistory\nAncient settlements\nThe area around present-day Cairo had long been a focal point of Ancient Egypt due to its strategic location at the junction of the Nile Valley and the Nile Delta regions (roughly Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt), which also placed it at the crossing of major routes between North Africa and the Levant. Memphis, the capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom and a major city up until the Ptolemaic period, was located a short distance south west of present-day Cairo. Heliopolis, another important city and major religious center, was located in what are now the modern districts of Matariya and Ain Shams in northeastern Cairo. It was largely destroyed by the Persian invasions in 525 BC and 343 BC and partly abandoned by the late first century BC.\nHowever, the origins of modern Cairo are generally traced back to a series of settlements in the first millennium AD. Around the turn of the fourth century, as Memphis was continuing to decline in importance, the Romans established a large fortress along the east bank of the Nile. The fortress, called Babylon, was built by the Roman emperor Diocletian (r. 285–305) at the entrance of a canal connecting the Nile to the Red Sea that was created earlier by Emperor Trajan (r. 98–117). Further north of the fortress, near the present-day district of al-Azbakiya, was a port and fortified outpost known as Tendunyas (Coptic: ϯⲁⲛⲧⲱⲛⲓⲁⲥ) or Umm Dunayn. While no structures older than the 7th century have been preserved in the area aside from the Roman fortifications, historical evidence suggests that a sizeable city existed. The city was important enough that its bishop, Cyrus, participated in the Second Council of Ephesus in 449.\nThe Byzantine-Sassanian War between 602 and 628 caused great hardship and likely caused much of the urban population to leave for the countryside, leaving the settlement partly deserted. The site today remains at the nucleus of the Coptic Orthodox community, which separated from the Roman and Byzantine churches in the late 4th century. Cairo's oldest extant churches, such as the Church of Saint Barbara and the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (from the late 7th or early 8th century), are located inside the fortress walls in what is now known as Old Cairo or Coptic Cairo.\n\nFustat and other early Islamic settlements\nThe Muslim conquest of Byzantine Egypt was led by Amr ibn al-As from 639 to 642. Babylon Fortress was besieged in September 640 and fell in April 641. In 641 or early 642, after the surrender of Alexandria, the Egyptian capital at the time, he founded a new settlement next to Babylon Fortress. The city, known as Fustat (Arabic: الفسطاط, romanised: al-Fusṭāṭ, lit. 'the tent'), served as a garrison town and as the new administrative capital of Egypt. Historians such as Janet Abu-Lughod and André Raymond trace the genesis of present-day Cairo to the foundation of Fustat. \nThe choice of founding a new settlement at this inland location, instead of using the existing capital of Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast, may have been due to the new conquerors' strategic priorities. One of the first projects of the new Muslim administration was to clear and re-open Trajan's ancient canal in order to ship grain more directly from Egypt to Medina, the capital of the caliphate in Arabia. Ibn al-As also founded a mosque for the city at the same time, now known as the Mosque of Amr Ibn al-As, the oldest mosque in Egypt and Africa (although the current structure dates from later expansions).\n\nIn 750, following the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate by the Abbasids, the new rulers created their own settlement to the northeast of Fustat which became the new provincial capital. This was known as al-Askar (Arabic: العسكر, lit. 'the camp') as it was laid out like a military camp. A governor's residence and a new mosque were also added, with the latter completed in 786. The Red Sea canal re-excavated in the 7th century was closed by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775), but a part of the canal, known as the Khalij, continued to be a major feature of Cairo's geography and of its water supply until the 19th century. In 861, on the orders of the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil, a Nilometer was built on Roda Island near Fustat. Although it was repaired and given a new roof in later centuries, its basic structure is still preserved today, making it the oldest preserved Islamic-era structure in Cairo today.\n\nIn 868, a commander of Turkic origin named Bakbak was sent to Egypt by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mu'taz to restore order after a rebellion in the country. He was accompanied by his stepson, Ahmad ibn Tulun, who became effective governor of Egypt. Over time, Ibn Tulun gained an army and accumulated influence and wealth, allowing him to become the de facto independent ruler of both Egypt and Syria by 878. In 870, he used his growing wealth to found a new administrative capital, al-Qata'i (Arabic: القطائـع, lit. 'the allotments'), to the northeast of Fustat and of al-Askar. \nThe new city included a palace known as the Dar al-Imara, a parade ground known as al-Maydan, a bimaristan (hospital), and an aqueduct to supply water. Between 876 and 879 Ibn Tulun built a great mosque, now known as the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, at the center of the city, next to the palace. After his death in 884, Ibn Tulun was succeeded by his son and his descendants who continued a short-lived dynasty, the Tulunids. In 905, the Abbasids sent general Muhammad Sulayman al-Katib to re-assert direct control over the country. Tulunid rule was ended and al-Qatta'i was razed to the ground, except for the mosque which remains standing today.\n\nFoundation and expansion of Cairo under the Fatimids\nIn 969, the Fatimid Caliphate conquered Egypt after ruling from Ifriqiya. The Fatimid Caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah instructed his courtier and general Jawhar al-Saqili to establish a new fortified city northeast of Fustat and of former al-Qata'i. It took four years to build the city, initially known as al-Manṣūriyyah, which was to serve as the new capital of the caliphate. During that time, the construction of the al-Azhar Mosque was commissioned by order of the caliph, which developed into the third-oldest university in the world. Cairo would eventually become a centre of learning, with the library of Cairo containing hundreds of thousands of books. When Caliph al-Mu'izz arrived from the old Fatimid capital of Mahdia in Tunisia in 973, he gave the city its present name, Qāhirat al-Mu'izz (\"The Vanquisher of al-Mu'izz\"), from which the name \"Cairo\" (al-Qāhira) originates. The caliphs lived in a vast and lavish palace complex that occupied the heart of the city. Cairo remained a relatively exclusive royal city for most of this era, but during the tenure of Badr al-Gamali as vizier (1073–1094) the restrictions were loosened for the first time and richer families from Fustat were allowed to move into the city. Between 1087 and 1092 Badr al-Gamali also rebuilt the city walls in stone and constructed the city gates of Bab al-Futuh, Bab al-Nasr, and Bab Zuweila that still stand today.\nDuring the Fatimid period Fustat reached its apogee in size and prosperity, acting as a center of craftsmanship and international trade and as the area's main port on the Nile. Historical sources report that multi-story communal residences existed in the city, particularly in its center, which were typically inhabited by middle and lower-class residents. Some of these were as high as seven stories and could house some 200 to 350 people. They may have been similar to Roman insulae and may have been the prototypes for the rental apartment complexes which became common in the later Mamluk and Ottoman periods. However, in 1168 the Fatimid vizier Shawar set fire to the unfortified Fustat to prevent its potential capture by Amalric, the Crusader king of Jerusalem. While the fire did not destroy the city and it continued to exist afterward, it did mark the beginning of its decline. Over the following centuries it was Cairo, the former palace-city, that became the new economic center and attracted migration from Fustat.\n\nWhile the Crusaders did not capture the city in 1168, a continuing power struggle between Shawar, King Amalric, and the Zengid general Shirkuh led to the downfall of the Fatimid establishment. In 1169, Shirkuh's nephew Saladin was appointed as the new vizier of Egypt by the Fatimids and two years later he seized power from the family of the last Fatimid caliph, al-'Āḍid. As the first Sultan of Egypt, Saladin established the Ayyubid dynasty, based in Cairo, and aligned Egypt with the Sunni Abbasids, who were based in Baghdad. In 1176, Saladin began construction on the Cairo Citadel, which was to serve as the seat of the Egyptian government until the mid-19th century. The construction of the Citadel definitively ended Fatimid-built Cairo's status as an exclusive palace-city and opened it up to common Egyptians and to foreign merchants, spurring its commercial development. Along with the Citadel, Saladin also began the construction of a new 20-kilometre-long wall that would protect both Cairo and Fustat on their eastern side and connect them with the new Citadel. These construction projects continued beyond Saladin's lifetime and were completed under his Ayyubid successors.\n\nFurther expansion and decline under the Ayyubids and Mamluks\nIn 1250, during the Seventh Crusade, the Ayyubid dynasty had a crisis with the death of al-Salih and power transitioned instead to the Mamluks, partly with the help of al-Salih's wife, Shajar ad-Durr, who ruled for a brief period around this time. Mamluks were soldiers who were purchased as young slaves and raised to serve in the sultan's army. Between 1250 and 1517 the throne of the Mamluk Sultanate passed from one mamluk to another in a system of succession that was generally non-hereditary, but also frequently violent and chaotic. The Mamluk Empire nonetheless became a major power in the region and was responsible for repelling the advance of the Mongols (most famously at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260) and for eliminating the last Crusader states in the Levant.\nDespite their military character, the Mamluks were also prolific builders and left a rich architectural legacy throughout Cairo. Continuing a practice started by the Ayyubids, much of the land occupied by former Fatimid palaces was sold and replaced by newer buildings, becoming a prestigious site for the construction of Mamluk religious and funerary complexes. Construction projects initiated by the Mamluks pushed the city outward while also bringing new infrastructure to the centre of the city. Meanwhile, Cairo flourished as a centre of Islamic scholarship and a crossroads on the spice trade route among the civilisations in Afro-Eurasia. Under the reign of the Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Muhammad (1293–1341, with interregnums), Cairo reached its apogee in terms of population and wealth. By 1340, Cairo had a population of close to half a million, making it the largest city west of China.\nMulti-story buildings occupied by rental apartments, known as a rab' (plural ribā' or urbu), became common in the Mamluk period and continued to be a feature of the city's housing during the later Ottoman period. These apartments were often laid out as multi-story duplexes or triplexes. They were sometimes attached to caravanserais, where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were rented out to tenants. The oldest partially-preserved example of this type of structure is the Wikala of Amir Qawsun, built before 1341. Residential buildings were in turn organised into close-knit neighbourhoods called a harat, which in many cases had gates that could be closed off at night or during disturbances.\n\nWhen the traveller Ibn Battuta first came to Cairo in 1326, he described it as the principal district of Egypt. When he passed through the area again on his return journey in 1348, the Black Death was ravaging most major cities. He cited reports of thousands of deaths per day in Cairo. Although Cairo avoided Europe's stagnation during the Late Middle Ages, it could not escape the Black Death, which struck the city more than fifty times between 1348 and 1517. \nDuring its initial, and most deadly waves, approximately 200,000 people were killed by the plague, and, by the 15th century, Cairo's population had been reduced to between 150,000 and 300,000. The population decline was accompanied by a period of political instability between 1348 and 1412. It was nonetheless in this period that the largest Mamluk-era religious monument, the Madrasa-Mosque of Sultan Hasan, was built. In the late 14th century, the Burji Mamluks replaced the Bahri Mamluks as rulers of the Mamluk state, but the Mamluk system continued to decline.\nThough the plagues returned frequently throughout the 15th century, Cairo remained a major metropolis and its population recovered in part through rural migration. More conscious efforts were conducted by rulers and city officials to redress the city's infrastructure and cleanliness. Its economy and politics also became more deeply connected with the wider Mediterranean. Some Mamluk sultans in this period, such as Barbsay (r. 1422–1438) and Qaytbay (r. 1468–1496), had relatively long and successful reigns. After al-Nasir Muhammad, Qaytbay was one of the most prolific patrons of art and architecture of the Mamluk era. He built or restored numerous monuments in Cairo, in addition to commissioning projects beyond Egypt. The crisis of Mamluk power and of Cairo's economic role deepened after Qaytbay. The city's status was diminished after Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around the Cape of Good Hope between 1497 and 1499, thereby allowing spice traders to avoid Cairo.\n\nOttoman rule\nCairo's political influence diminished significantly after the Ottomans defeated Sultan al-Ghuri in the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516 and conquered Egypt in 1517. Ruling from Constantinople, Sultan Selim I relegated Egypt to a province, with Cairo as its capital. For this reason, the history of Cairo during Ottoman times is often described as inconsequential, especially in comparison to other time periods.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, Cairo still remained an important economic and cultural centre. Although no longer on the spice route, the city facilitated the transportation of Yemeni coffee and Indian textiles, primarily to Anatolia, North Africa, and the Balkans. Cairene merchants were instrumental in bringing goods to the barren Hejaz, especially during the annual hajj to Mecca. It was during this same period that al-Azhar University reached the predominance among Islamic schools that it continues to hold today; pilgrims on their way to hajj often attested to the superiority of the institution, which had become associated with Egypt's body of Islamic scholars. The first printing press of the Middle East, printing in Hebrew, was established in Cairo c. 1557 by a scion of the Soncino family of printers, Italian Jews of Ashkenazi origin who operated a press in Constantinople. The existence of the press is known solely from two fragments discovered in the Cairo Geniza.\n\nUnder the Ottomans, Cairo expanded south and west from its nucleus around the Citadel. The city was the second-largest in the empire, behind Constantinople, and, although migration was not the primary source of Cairo's growth, twenty percent of its population at the end of the 18th century consisted of religious minorities and foreigners from around the Mediterranean. Still, when Napoleon arrived in Cairo in 1798, the city's population was less than 300,000, forty percent lower than it was at the height of Mamluk—and Cairene—influence in the mid-14th century.\nThe French occupation was short-lived as British and Ottoman forces, including a sizeable Albanian contingent, recaptured the country in 1801. Cairo itself was besieged by a British and Ottoman force culminating with the French surrender on 22 June 1801. The British vacated Egypt two years later, leaving the Ottomans, the Albanians, and the long-weakened Mamluks jostling for control of the country. Continued civil war allowed an Albanian named Muhammad Ali Pasha to ascend to the role of commander and eventually, with the approval of the religious establishment, viceroy of Egypt in 1805.\n\nModern era\nUntil his death in 1848, Muhammad Ali Pasha instituted a number of social and economic reforms that earned him the title of founder of modern Egypt. However, while Muhammad Ali initiated the construction of public buildings in the city, those reforms had minimal effect on Cairo's landscape. Bigger changes came to Cairo under Isma'il Pasha (r. 1863–1879), who continued the modernisation processes started by his grandfather. Drawing inspiration from Paris, Isma'il envisioned a city of maidans and wide avenues; due to financial constraints, only some of them, in the area now composing Downtown Cairo, came to fruition. Isma'il also sought to modernise the city, which was merging with neighbouring settlements, by establishing a public works ministry, bringing gas and lighting to the city, and opening a theatre and opera house.\nThe immense debt resulting from Isma'il's projects provided a pretext for increasing European control, which culminated with the British invasion in 1882. The city's economic centre quickly moved west toward the Nile, away from the historic Islamic Cairo section and toward the contemporary, European-style areas built by Isma'il. Europeans accounted for five percent of Cairo's population at the end of the 19th century, by which point they held most top governmental positions.\nIn 1906, the Heliopolis Oasis Company headed by the Belgian industrialist Édouard Empain and his Egyptian counterpart Boghos Nubar, built a suburb called Heliopolis (city of the sun in Greek) ten kilometers from the center of Cairo. In 1905–1907 the northern part of the Gezira island was developed by the Baehler Company into Zamalek, which would later become Cairo's upscale \"chic\" neighbourhood. In 1906 construction began on Garden City, a neighbourhood of urban villas with gardens and curved streets.\n\nThe British occupation was intended to be temporary, but it lasted well into the 20th century. Nationalists staged large-scale demonstrations in Cairo in 1919, five years after Egypt had been declared a British protectorate. Nevertheless, this led to Egypt's independence in 1922.\nThe King Fuad I Edition of the Qur'an was first published on 10 July 1924 in Cairo under the patronage of King Fuad. The goal of the government of the newly formed Kingdom of Egypt was not to delegitimise the other variant Quranic texts (\"qira'at\"), but to eliminate errors found in Qur'anic texts used in state schools. A committee of teachers chose to preserve a single one of the canonical qira'at \"readings\", namely that of the \"Ḥafṣ\" version, an 8th-century Kufic recitation. This edition has become the standard for modern printings of the Quran for much of the Islamic world. The publication has been called a \"terrific success\", and the edition has been described as one \"now widely seen as the official text of the Qur'an\", so popular among both Sunni and Shi'a that the common belief among less well-informed Muslims is \"that the Qur'an has a single, unambiguous reading\". Minor amendments were made later in 1924 and in 1936 - the \"Faruq edition\" in honour of then ruler, King Faruq.\n\nBritish occupation until 1956\nBritish troops remained in the country until 1956. During this time, urban Cairo, spurred by new bridges and transport links, continued to expand to include the upscale neighbourhoods of Garden City, Zamalek, and Heliopolis. Between 1882 and 1937, the population of Cairo more than tripled—from 347,000 to 1.3 million—and its area increased from 10 to 163 km2 (4 to 63 sq mi).\nThe city was devastated during the 1952 riots known as the Cairo Fire or Black Saturday, which saw the destruction of nearly 700 shops, movie theatres, casinos and hotels in downtown Cairo. The British departed Cairo following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, but the city's rapid growth showed no signs of abating. Seeking to accommodate the increasing population, President Gamal Abdel Nasser redeveloped Tahrir Square and the Nile Corniche, and improved the city's network of bridges and highways. Meanwhile, additional controls of the Nile fostered development within Gezira Island and along the city's waterfront. The metropolis began to encroach on the fertile Nile Delta, prompting the government to build desert satellite towns and devise incentives for city-dwellers to move to them.\n\nAfter 1956\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Cairo continued to grow enormously in both population and area. Between 1947 and 2006, the population of Greater Cairo went from 2,986,280 to 16,292,269. The population explosion also drove the rise of \"informal\" housing ('ashwa'iyyat), meaning housing that was built without any official planning or control. The exact form of this type of housing varies considerably but usually has a much higher population density than formal housing. By 2009, over 63% of the population of Greater Cairo lived in informal neighbourhoods, even though these occupied only 17% of the total area of Greater Cairo. According to economist David Sims, informal housing has the benefits of providing affordable accommodation and vibrant communities to huge numbers of Cairo's working classes, but it also suffers from government neglect, a relative lack of services, and overcrowding.\nThe \"formal\" city was also expanded. The most notable example was the creation of Madinat Nasr, a huge government-sponsored expansion of the city to the east which officially began in 1959 but was primarily developed in the mid-1970s. Starting in 1977 the Egyptian government established the New Urban Communities Authority to initiate and direct the development of new planned cities on the outskirts of Cairo, generally established on desert land. These new satellite cities were intended to provide housing, investment, and employment opportunities for the region's growing population as well as to pre-empt the further growth of informal neighbourhoods. As of 2014, about 10% of the population of Greater Cairo lived in the new cities.\nConcurrently, Cairo established itself as a political and economic hub for North Africa and the Arab world, with many multinational businesses and organisations, including the Arab League, operating out of the city. In 1979 the historic districts of Cairo were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nIn 1992, Cairo was hit by an earthquake causing 545 deaths, injuring 6,512 and leaving around 50,000 people homeless.\n\n2011 Egyptian revolution\nCairo's Tahrir Square was the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian revolution against former president Hosni Mubarak. More than 50,000 protesters first occupied the square on 25 January, during which the area's wireless services were reported to be impaired. In the following days Tahrir Square continued to be the primary destination for protests in Cairo. The uprising was mainly a campaign of non-violent civil resistance, which featured a series of demonstrations, marches, acts of civil disobedience, and labour strikes. Millions of protesters from a variety of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.\nDespite being predominantly peaceful in nature, the revolution was not without violent clashes between security forces and protesters, with at least 846 people killed and 6,000 injured. The uprising took place in Cairo, Alexandria, and in other cities in Egypt, following the Tunisian revolution that resulted in the overthrow of the long-time Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. On 11 February, following weeks of determined popular protest and pressure, Hosni Mubarak resigned from office.\n\nPost-revolutionary Cairo\nUnder the rule of President el-Sisi, in March 2015 plans were announced for another yet-unnamed planned city to be built further east of the existing satellite city of New Cairo, intended to serve as the new capital of Egypt.\n\nGeography\nCairo is located in northern Egypt, known as Lower Egypt, 165 km (100 mi) south of the Mediterranean Sea and 120 km (75 mi) west of the Gulf of Suez and Suez Canal. The city lies along the Nile River, immediately south of the point where the river leaves its desert-bound valley and branches into the low-lying Nile Delta region. Although the Cairo metropolis extends away from the Nile in all directions, the city of Cairo resides only on the east bank of the river and two islands within it on a total area of 453 km2 (175 sq mi). Geologically, Cairo lies on alluvium and sand dunes which date from the quaternary period.\nUntil the mid-19th century, when the river was tamed by dams, levees, and other controls, the Nile in the vicinity of Cairo was highly susceptible to changes in course and surface level. Over the years, the Nile gradually shifted westward, providing the site between the eastern edge of the river and the Mokattam highlands on which the city now stands. The land on which Cairo was established in 969 (present-day Islamic Cairo) was located underwater just over three hundred years earlier, when Fustat was first built.\nLow periods of the Nile during the 11th century continued to add to the landscape of Cairo; a new island, known as Geziret al-Fil, first appeared in 1174, but eventually became connected to the mainland. Today, the site of Geziret al-Fil is occupied by the Shubra district. The low periods created another island at the turn of the 14th century that now composes Zamalek and Gezira. Land reclamation efforts by the Mamluks and Ottomans further contributed to expansion on the east bank of the river.\nBecause of the Nile's movement, the newer parts of the city—Garden City, Downtown Cairo, and Zamalek—are located closest to the riverbank. The areas, which are home to most of Cairo's embassies, are surrounded on the north, east, and south by the older parts of the city. Old Cairo, located south of the centre, holds the remnants of Fustat and the heart of Egypt's Coptic Christian community, Coptic Cairo. The Boulaq district, which lies in the northern part of the city, was born out of a major 16th-century port and is now a major industrial centre. \nThe Citadel is located east of the city centre around Islamic Cairo, which dates back to the Fatimid era and the foundation of Cairo. While western Cairo is dominated by wide boulevards, open spaces, and modern architecture of European influence, the eastern half, having grown haphazardly over the centuries, is dominated by small lanes, crowded tenements, and Islamic architecture.\nNorthern and extreme eastern parts of Cairo, which include satellite towns, are among the most recent additions to the city, as they developed in the late-20th and early-21st centuries to accommodate the city's rapid growth. The western bank of the Nile is commonly included within the urban area of Cairo, but it composes the city of Giza and the Giza Governorate. Giza city has also undergone significant expansion over recent years, and today has a population of 2.7 million. The Cairo Governorate was just north of the Helwan Governorate from 2008 when some Cairo's southern districts, including Maadi and New Cairo, were split off and annexed into the new governorate, to 2011 when the Helwan Governorate was reincorporated into the Cairo Governorate.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the level of air pollution in Cairo is nearly 12 times higher than the recommended safety level.\n\nClimate\nIn Cairo, and along the Nile River Valley, the climate is a hot desert climate (BWh according to the Köppen climate classification system).\nWind storms can be frequent, bringing Saharan dust into the city, from March to May and the air often becomes uncomfortably dry. Winters are mild to warm, while summers are long and hot. High temperatures in winter range from 14 to 22 °C (57 to 72 °F), while night-time lows drop to below 11 °C (52 °F), often to 5 °C (41 °F). In summer, the highs often exceed 31 °C (88 °F) but rarely surpass 40 °C (104 °F), and lows drop to about 20 °C (68 °F). Rainfall is sparse and only happens in the colder months, but sudden showers can cause severe flooding. The summer months have high humidity due to its proximity to the Mediterranean coast. Snowfall is extremely rare; a small amount of graupel, widely believed to be snow, fell on Cairo's easternmost suburbs on 13 December 2013, the first time Cairo's area received this kind of precipitation in many decades. Dew points in the hottest months range from 13.9 °C (57 °F) in June to 18.3 °C (65 °F) in August.\n\nMetropolitan area and districts\nThe city of Cairo forms part of Greater Cairo, the largest metropolitan area in Africa. While it has no administrative body, the Ministry of Planning considers it as an economic region consisting of Cairo Governorate, Giza Governorate, and Qalyubia Governorate. As a contiguous metropolitan area, various studies have considered Greater Cairo be composed of the administrative cities that are Cairo, Giza and Shubra al-Kheima, in addition to the satellite cities/new towns surrounding them.\nCairo is a city-state where the governor is also the head of the city. Cairo City itself differs from other Egyptian cities in that it has an extra administrative division between the city and district levels, and that is areas, which are headed by deputy governors. Cairo consists of 4 areas (manatiq, singl. mantiqa) divided into 38 districts (ahya', singl. hayy) and 46 qisms (police wards, 1-2 per district):\nThe Northern Area is divided into 8 Districts:\n\nShubra\nAl-Zawiya al-Hamra\nHadayek al-Qubba\nRod al-Farg\nAl-Sharabia\nAl-Sahel\nAl-Zeitoun\nAl-Amiriyya\n\nThe Eastern Area divided into 9 Districts and three new cities:\n\nMisr al-Gadidah and Al-Nozha (Heliopolis)\nNasr City East and Nasr City West\nAl-Salam 1 (Awwal) and al-Salam 2 (Than)\nAin Shams\nAl-Matariya\nAl-Marg\nShorouk (Under jurisdiction of NUCA)\nBadr (Under jurisdiction of NUCA)\nAl-Qahira al-Gadida (New Cairo, three qisms, under jurisdiction of NUCA)\n\nThe Western Area divided into 9 Districts:\n\nManshiyat Nasser\nAl-Wayli (Incl. qism al-Daher)\nWasat al-Qahira (Central Cairo, incl. Al-Darb al-Ahmar, al-Gamaliyya qisms)\nBulaq\nGharb al-Qahira (West Cairo, incl. Zamalek qism, Qasr al-Nil qism incl. Garden City and part of Down Town)\nAbdeen\nAl-Azbakiya\nAl-Muski\nBab al-Sha'aria\n\nThe Southern Area divided into 12 Districts:\n\nMasr El-Qadima (Old Cairo, including Al-Manial)\nAl-Khalifa\nAl-Moqattam\nAl-Basatin\nDar al-Salam\nSayyidah Zainab District\nEl Tebbin\nHelwan\nAl-Ma'sara\nAl-Maadi\nTora\n15th of May (Under jurisdiction of NUCA)\n\nSatellite cities\nSince 1977 a number of new towns have been planned and built by the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) in the Eastern Desert around Cairo, ostensibly  to accommodate additional population growth and development of the city and stem the development of self-built informal areas, especially over agricultural land. As of 2022 four new towns have been built and have residential populations: 15th of May City, Badr City, Shorouk City, and New Cairo. In addition, two more are under construction: the New Administrative Capital. And Capital Gardens, where land was allocated in 2021, and which will house most of the civil servants employed in the new capital.\n\nPlanned new capital\nIn March 2015, plans were announced for a new city to be built east of Cairo, in an undeveloped area of the Cairo Governorate, which would serve as the New Administrative Capital of Egypt. Cairo also introduced more modern metro lines to reduce traffic in central areas.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2017 census, Cairo had a population of 9,539,673 people, distributed across 46 qisms (police wards):\n\nReligion\nThe majority of Egypt and Cairo's population is Sunni Muslim. A significant Christian minority exists, among whom Coptic Orthodox are the majority. Precise numbers for each religious community in Egypt are not available and estimates vary. Other churches that have, or had, a presence in modern Cairo include the Catholic Church (including Armenian Catholic, Coptic Catholic, Chaldean Catholic, Syrian Catholic, and Maronite), the Greek Orthodox Church, the Evangelical Church of Egypt (Synod of the Nile), and some Protestant churches. Cairo has been the seat of the Coptic Orthodox Church since the 12th century, and the seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope is located in Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral. Until the 20th century, Cairo had a sizeable Jewish community, but as of 2022 only three Jews were reported to be living in the city. A total of 12 synagogues in Cairo still exist.\n\nEconomy\nCairo's economy has traditionally been based on governmental institutions and services, with the modern productive sector expanding in the 20th century to include developments in textiles and food processing – specifically the production of sugar cane. As of 2005, Egypt has the largest non-oil based GDP in the Arab world.\nCairo accounts for 11% of Egypt's population and 22% of its economy (PPP). The majority of the nation's commerce is generated there, or passes through the city. The great majority of publishing houses and media outlets and nearly all film studios are there, as are half of the nation's hospital beds and universities. This has fuelled rapid construction in the city, with one building in five being less than 15 years old.\nThis growth until recently surged well ahead of city services. Homes, roads, electricity, telephone and sewer services were all in short supply. Analysts trying to grasp the magnitude of the change coined terms like \"hyper-urbanization\".\n\nAutomobile manufacturers from Cairo\nArab American Vehicles Company (vehicles by Stellantis alliance)\nEgyptian Light Transport Manufacturing Company (Egyptian NSU pedant)\nGhabbour Group (Fuso, Hyundai and Volvo)\nMCV Corporate Group (a part of the Daimler AG)\nMod Car\nSeoudi Group (Modern Motors: Nissan, BMW (formerly); El-Mashreq: Alfa Romeo and Fiat)\nSperanza (former Daewoo Motors Egypt; Chery, Daewoo)\nGeneral Motors Egypt\n\nInfrastructure\nHealth\nCairo, as well as neighbouring Giza, has been established as Egypt's main centre for medical treatment, and despite some exceptions, has the most advanced level of medical care in the country. Cairo's hospitals include the JCI-accredited As-Salaam International Hospital, Ain Shams University Hospital, Dar Al Fouad, Nile Badrawi Hospital, 57357 Hospital, as well as Qasr El Eyni Hospital.\n\nEducation\nGreater Cairo has long been the hub of education and educational services for Egypt and the region.\nToday, Greater Cairo is the centre for many government offices governing the Egyptian educational system, has the largest number of educational schools, and higher education institutes among other cities and governorates of Egypt.\nSome of the International Schools found in Cairo:\n\nUniversities in Greater Cairo:\n\nTransport\nCairo has an extensive road network, rail system, subway system and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles, taxi cabs, privately owned public buses and microbuses. Cairo International Airport is the country's largest airport and one of the busiest airports in Africa.\n\nPublic transportation\nCairo, specifically Ramses Station, is the centre of almost the entire Egyptian transportation network. The Cairo Transportation Authority (CTA) manages Cairo's public transit and runs the Cairo Metro. The metro network covers Helwan and other suburbs. It can get very crowded during rush hour. Two train cars (the fourth and fifth ones) are reserved for women only, although women may ride in any car they want. Trams in Greater Cairo and Cairo trolleybus were used as modes of transportation, but were closed in the 1970s everywhere except Heliopolis and Helwan. These were shut down in 2014, after the Egyptian Revolution. In 2022, the Cairo Light Rail Transit system opened. Despite the name, the CLRT is more like a commuter rail system than a Light Rail system. As of 2025, the system consists of a single bifurcating line of 12 stations over 70 km, with a top speed of 12p km/h. In 2017, plans to construct two monorail systems were announced, one linking 6th of October to suburban Giza, a distance of 35 km (22 mi), and the other linking Nasr City to New Cairo, a distance of 52 km (32 mi).\n\nRoads\nTwo trans-African automobile routes originate in Cairo: the Cairo-Cape Town Highway and the Cairo-Dakar Highway. An extensive road network connects Cairo with other Egyptian cities and villages. There is a new Ring Road that surrounds the outskirts of the city, with exits that reach outer Cairo districts. There are flyovers and bridges, such as the 6th October Bridge that, when the traffic is not heavy, allow fast means of transportation from one side of the city to the other.\nCairo traffic is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded. Traffic moves at a relatively fluid pace. Drivers tend to be aggressive, but are more courteous at junctions, taking turns going, with police aiding in traffic control of some congested areas.\n\nOther forms of transport\nBolt\nCairo Nile Ferry\nCairo Taxi/Yellow Cab\nCareem\nDiDi\nUber\n\nCulture\nCultural tourism in Egypt\nCairo Opera House\nPresident Mubarak inaugurated the new Cairo Opera House of the Egyptian National Cultural Centres on 10 October 1988, 17 years after the Royal Opera House had been destroyed by fire. The National Cultural Centre was built with the help of JICA, the Japan International Co-operation Agency and stands as a prominent feature for the Japanese-Egyptian co-operation and the friendship between the two nations.\n\nKhedivial Opera House\nThe Khedivial Opera House, or Royal Opera House, was the original opera house in Cairo. It was dedicated on 1 November 1869 and burned down on 28 October 1971. After the original opera house was destroyed, Cairo was without an opera house for nearly two decades until the opening of the new Cairo Opera House in 1988.\n\nCairo International Film Festival\nCairo held its first international film festival 16 August 1976, when the first Cairo International Film Festival was launched by the Egyptian Association of Film Writers and Critics, headed by Kamal El-Mallakh. The Association ran the festival for seven years until 1983.\nThis achievement lead to the President of the Festival again contacting the FIAPF with the request that a competition should be included at the 1991 Festival. The request was granted.\nIn 1998, the Festival took place under the presidency of one of Egypt's leading actors, Hussein Fahmy, who was appointed by the Minister of Culture, Farouk Hosni, after the death of Saad El-Din Wahba. Four years later, the journalist and writer Cherif El-Shoubashy became president.\n\nCairo Geniza\nThe Cairo Geniza is an accumulation of almost 200,000 Jewish manuscripts that were found in the genizah of the Ben Ezra Synagogue (built 882) of Fustat, Egypt (now Old Cairo), the Basatin cemetery east of Old Cairo, and a number of old documents that were bought in Cairo in the later 19th century. These documents were written from about 870 to 1880 AD and have been archived in various American and European libraries. The Taylor-Schechter collection in the University of Cambridge runs to 140,000 manuscripts; a further 40,000 manuscripts are housed at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.\n\nSports\nFootball is the most popular sport in Egypt, and Cairo has sporting teams that compete in national and regional leagues, most notably Al Ahly and Zamalek SC, who were the CAF first and second African clubs of the 20th century. The annual match between Al Ahly and El Zamalek is one of the most watched sports events in Egypt. The teams form the major rivalry of Egyptian football. They play their home games at Cairo International Stadium, which is the second largest stadium in Egypt, as well as the largest in Cairo.\nThe Cairo International Stadium was built in 1960. Its multi-purpose sports complex houses the main football stadium, an indoor stadium, satellite fields that hold regional and continental games, including the African Games, U17 Football World Championship and the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations. Egypt later won the competition and the next edition in Ghana (2008) making the Egyptian and Ghanaian national teams the only to win the African Nations Cup back to back. Egypt won the title for a record six times in the history of African Continental Competition. This was followed by a third consecutive win in Angola in 2010, making Egypt the only country with a record 3-consecutive and 7-total Continental Football Competition winner. As of 2021, Egypt's national team is ranked #46 in the world by FIFA.\nCairo failed at the applicant stage when bidding for the 2008 Summer Olympics, which was hosted in Beijing. However, Cairo did host the 2007 Pan Arab Games.\nThere are other sports teams in the city that participate in several sports including Gezira Sporting Club, el Shams Club, Shooting Club, Heliopolis Sporting Club, and several smaller clubs. There are new sports clubs in the area of New Cairo (one hour far from Cairo's downtown), these are Al Zohour sporting club, Wadi Degla sporting club and Platinum Club.\nMost of the sports federations of the country are located in the city suburbs, including the Egyptian Football Association. The headquarters of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) was previously located in Cairo, before relocating to its new headquarters in 6 October City, a small city away from Cairo's crowded districts. In 2008, the Egyptian Rugby Federation was officially formed and granted membership into the International Rugby Board.\nEgypt is internationally known for the excellence of its squash players who excel in professional and junior divisions. Egypt has seven players in the top ten of the PSA men's world rankings, and three in the women's top ten. Mohamed El Shorbagy held the world number one position for more than a year. Nour El Sherbini has won the Women's World Championship twice and has been the women's world number one. On 30 April 2016, she became the youngest woman to win the Women's World Championship. In 2017 she retained her title.\nCairo is the official endpoint of Cross Egypt Challenge where its route ends yearly in the most sacred place in Egypt, under the Great Pyramids of Giza with a huge trophy-giving ceremony.\n\nCityscape and landmarks\nTahrir Square\nTahrir Square was founded during the mid 19th century with the establishment of modern downtown Cairo. It was first named Ismailia Square, after the 19th-century ruler Khedive Ismail, who commissioned the new downtown district's 'Paris on the Nile' design. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1919 the square became widely known as Tahrir (Liberation) Square, though it was not officially renamed as such until after the 1952 Revolution which eliminated the monarchy. Several notable buildings surround the square including, the American University in Cairo's downtown campus, the Mogamma governmental administrative Building, the headquarters of the Arab League, the Nile Ritz Carlton Hotel, and the Egyptian Museum. Being at the heart of Cairo, the square has witnessed several major protests over the years. However, the most notable event in the square was being the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution against former president Hosni Mubarak. In 2020 the government completed the erection of a new monument in the center of the square featuring an ancient obelisk from the reign of Ramses II, originally unearthed at Tanis (San al-Hagar) in 2019, and four ram-headed sphinx statues moved from Karnak.\n\nEgyptian Museum\nThe Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, known commonly as the Egyptian Museum, is home to the most extensive collection of ancient Egyptian antiquities in the world. It has 136,000 items on display, with many more hundreds of thousands in its basement storerooms. Among the collections on display are the finds from the tomb of Tutankhamun.\n\nGrand Egyptian Museum\nMuch of the collection of the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, including the Tutankhamun collection, are slated to be moved to the new Grand Egyptian Museum, under construction in Giza and was due to open by the end of 2020.\n\nCairo Tower\nThe Cairo Tower is a free-standing tower with a revolving restaurant at the top. It is one of Cairo's landmarks and provides a bird's eye view of the city to restaurant patrons. It stands in the Zamalek district on Gezira Island on the Nile River, in the city centre. At 187 m (614 ft), it is 44 m (144 ft) higher than the Great Pyramid of Giza, which stands some 15 km (9 mi) to the southwest.\n\nOld Cairo\nThis area of Cairo is so-named as it contains the remains of the ancient Roman fortress of Babylon and also overlaps the original site of Fustat, the first Arab settlement in Egypt (7th century AD) and the predecessor of later Cairo. The area includes Coptic Cairo, which holds a high concentration of old Christian churches such as the Hanging Church, the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, and other Christian or Coptic buildings, most of which are located in an enclave on the site of the ancient Roman fortress. It is also the location of the Coptic Museum, which showcases the history of Coptic art from Greco-Roman to Islamic times, and of the Ben Ezra Synagogue, the oldest and best-known synagogue in Cairo, where the important collection of Geniza documents were discovered in the 19th century.\n\nTo the north of this Coptic enclave is the Amr ibn al-'As Mosque, the first mosque in Egypt and the most important religious centre of what was formerly Fustat, founded in 642 AD right after the Arab conquest but rebuilt many times since. A part of the former city of Fustat has also been excavated to the east of the mosque and of the Coptic enclave, although the archeological site is threatened by encroaching construction and modern development. To the northwest of Babylon Fortress and the mosque is the Monastery of Saint Mercurius (or Dayr Abu Sayfayn), an important and historic Coptic religious complex consisting of the Church of Saint Mercurius, the Church of Saint Shenute, and the Church of the Virgin (also known as al-Damshiriya). Several other historic churches are also situated to the south of Babylon Fortress.\n\nIslamic Cairo\nCairo holds one of the greatest concentrations of historical monuments of Islamic architecture in the world. The areas around the old walled city and around the Citadel are characterised by hundreds of mosques, tombs, madrasas, mansions, caravanserais, and fortifications dating from the Islamic era and are often referred to as \"Islamic Cairo\", especially in English travel literature. It is also the location of several important religious shrines such as the al-Hussein Mosque (whose shrine is believed to hold the head of Husayn ibn Ali), the Mausoleum of Imam al-Shafi'i (founder of the Shafi'i madhhab, one of the primary schools of thought in Sunni Islamic jurisprudence), the Tomb of Sayyida Ruqayya, the Mosque of Sayyida Nafisa, and others.\nThe first mosque in Egypt was the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in what was formerly Fustat, the first Arab-Muslim settlement in the area. However, the Mosque of Ibn Tulun is the oldest mosque that still retains its original form and is a rare example of Abbasid architecture from the classical period of Islamic civilisation. It was built in 876–879 AD in a style inspired by the Abbasid capital of Samarra in Iraq. It is one of the largest mosques in Cairo and is often cited as one of the most beautiful. Another Abbasid construction, the Nilometer on Roda Island, is the oldest original structure in Cairo, built in 862 AD. It was designed to measure the level of the Nile, which was important for agricultural and administrative purposes.\nThe settlement that was formally named Cairo (Arabic: al-Qahira) was founded to the northeast of Fustat in 959 AD by the victorious Fatimid army. The Fatimids built it as a separate palatial city which contained their palaces and institutions of government. It was enclosed by a circuit of walls, which were rebuilt in stone in the late 11th century AD by the vizier Badr al-Gamali, parts of which survive today at Bab Zuwayla in the south and Bab al-Futuh and Bab al-Nasr in the north. Among the extant monuments from the Fatimid era are the large Mosque of al-Hakim, the Aqmar Mosque, Juyushi Mosque, Lulua Mosque, and the Mosque of Al-Salih Tala'i.\nOne of the most important and lasting institutions founded in the Fatimid period was the Mosque of al-Azhar, founded in 970 AD, which competes with the al-Qarawiyyin in Fes for the title of oldest university in the world. Today, al-Azhar University is the foremost Center of Islamic learning in the world and one of Egypt's largest universities with campuses across the country. The mosque itself retains significant Fatimid elements but has been added to and expanded in subsequent centuries, notably by the Mamluk sultans Qaytbay and al-Ghuri and by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda in the 18th century.\nThe most prominent architectural heritage of medieval Cairo, however, dates from the Mamluk period, from 1250 to 1517 AD. The Mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life, commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque, madrasa, khanqah (for Sufis), a sabil (water dispensary), and a mausoleum for themselves and their families. Among the best-known examples of Mamluk monuments in Cairo are the huge Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan, the Mosque of Amir al-Maridani, the Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad (whose twin minarets were built above the gate of Bab Zuwayla), the Sultan Al-Ghuri complex, the funerary complex of Sultan Qaytbay in the Northern Cemetery, and the trio of monuments in the Bayn al-Qasrayn area comprising the complex of Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun, the Madrasa of al-Nasir Muhammad, and the Madrasa of Sultan Barquq. Some mosques include spolia (often columns or capitals) from earlier buildings built by the Romans, Byzantines, or Copts.\nThe Mamluks, and the later Ottomans, also built wikalas or caravanserais to house merchants and goods due to the important role of trade and commerce in Cairo's economy. Still intact today is the Wikala al-Ghuri, which today hosts regular performances by the Al-Tannoura Egyptian Heritage Dance Troupe. The Khan al-Khalili is a commercial hub which also integrated caravanserais (also known as khans).\n\nCitadel of Cairo\nThe Citadel is a fortified enclosure begun by Salah al-Din in 1176 AD on an outcrop of the Muqattam Hills as part of a large defensive system to protect both Cairo to the north and Fustat to the southwest. It was the centre of Egyptian government and residence of its rulers until 1874, when Khedive Isma'il moved to 'Abdin Palace. It is still occupied by the military today, but is now open as a tourist attraction comprising, notably, the National Military Museum, the 14th century Mosque of al-Nasir Muhammad, and the 19th century Mosque of Muhammad Ali which commands a dominant position on Cairo's skyline.\n\nKhan el-Khalili\nKhan el-Khalili is an ancient bazaar, or marketplace adjacent to the Al-Hussein Mosque. It dates back to 1385, when Amir Jarkas el-Khalili built a large caravanserai, or khan. (A caravanserai is a hotel for traders, and usually the focal point for any surrounding area.) This original caravanserai building was demolished by Sultan al-Ghuri, who rebuilt it as a new commercial complex in the early 16th century, forming the basis for the network of souqs existing today. Many medieval elements remain today, including the ornate Mamluk-style gateways. Today, Khan el-Khalili is a major tourist attraction and popular stop for tour groups.\n\nSociety\nIn the present day, Cairo is a heavily urbanised city. Because of the influx of people into the city, lone standing houses are rare, and apartment buildings accommodate for the limited space and abundance of people. Single detached houses are usually owned by the wealthy. Formal education is also seen as important, with twelve years of standard formal education. Cairenes can take a standardised test similar to the SAT to be accepted to an institution of higher learning, but most children do not finish school and opt to pick up a trade to enter the workforce. Egypt still struggles with poverty, with almost half the population living on $2 or less a day.\n\nWomen's rights\nThe civil rights movement for women in Cairo – and by extent, Egypt – has been a struggle for years. Women are reported to face constant discrimination, sexual harassment, and abuse throughout Cairo. A 2013 UN study found that over 99% of Egyptian women reported experiencing sexual harassment at some point in their lives. The problem has persisted in spite of new national laws since 2014 defining and criminalising sexual harassment. The situation is so severe that in 2017, Cairo was named by one poll as the most dangerous megacity for women in the world. In 2020, the social media account \"Assault Police\" began to name and shame perpetrators of violence against women, in an effort to dissuade potential offenders. The account was founded by student Nadeen Ashraf, who is credited for instigating an iteration of the #MeToo movement in Egypt.\n\nPollution\nThe air pollution in Cairo is a matter of serious concern. Greater Cairo's volatile aromatic hydrocarbon levels are higher than many other similar cities. Air quality measurements in Cairo have also been recording dangerous levels of lead, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and suspended particulate matter concentrations due to decades of unregulated vehicle emissions, urban industrial operations, and chaff and trash burning. There are over 4,500,000 cars on the streets of Cairo, 60% of which are over 10 years old, and therefore lack modern emission cutting features. Cairo has a very poor dispersion factor because of its lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets, which create a bowl effect.\nIn recent years, a black cloud (as Egyptians refer to it) of smog  has appeared over Cairo every autumn due to temperature inversion. Smog causes serious respiratory diseases and eye irritations for the city's citizens. Tourists who are not familiar with such high levels of pollution must take extra care.\nCairo also has many unregistered lead and copper smelters which heavily pollute the city. The results of this has been a permanent haze over the city with particulate matter in the air reaching over three times normal levels. It is estimated that 10,000 to 25,000 people a year in Cairo die due to air pollution-related diseases. Lead has been shown to cause harm to the central nervous system and neurotoxicity particularly in children. In 1995, the first environmental acts were introduced and the situation has seen some improvement with 36 air monitoring stations and emissions tests on cars. Twenty thousand buses have also been commissioned to the city to improve congestion levels, which are very high.\nThe city also suffers from a high level of land pollution. Cairo produces 10,000 tons of waste material each day, 4,000 tons of which are not collected or managed. This is a huge health hazard, and the Egyptian Government is looking for ways to combat this. The Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Agency was founded to collect and recycle the waste; they work with the Zabbaleen community that has been collecting and recycling Cairo's waste since the turn of the 20th century and live in an area known locally as Manshiyat Naser. Both are working together to pick up as much waste as possible within the city limits, though it remains a pressing problem.\n\nInternational relations\nThe Headquarters of the Arab League is located at Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nCairo is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nZulfikar family, Egyptian noble family\nRabab Al-Kadhimi (1918–1998), dentist and poet\nWael Alaa (born 1987), musician known as Neobyrd\nAmr Aly (born 1962), American soccer player and Olympian\nGamal Aziz, also known as Gamal Mohammed Abdelaziz, former president and chief operating officer of Wynn Resorts, and former CEO of MGM Resorts International, indicted as part of the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal\nYasser Arafat (1929–2004), born Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf al-Qudwa al-Husseini, was the 3rd Chairman of The PLO and first president of the Palestinian Authority\nAbu Sa'id al-Afif, 15th-century Samaritan\nEzz El-Dine Zulficar (1919–1963), Egyptian film director, screenwriter, actor and producer, known for his distinctive style, which blends romance and action.

      "summary": "Cairo is the capital and largest city of Egypt and the Cairo Governorate, being home to more than 10 million people. It is also part of the largest urban agglomeration in Africa, the Arab world, and the Middle East. The Greater Cairo metropolitan area is one of the largest in the world by population with over 22 million people.\nThe area that would become Cairo was part of ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex and the ancient cities of Memphis and Heliopolis are near-by. Located near the Nile Delta, the predecessor settlement was Fustat following the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 next to an existing ancient Roman fortress, Babylon. Subsequently, Cairo was founded by the Fatimid dynasty in 969. It later superseded Fustat as the main urban centre during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods (12th–16th centuries).\nCairo has since become a longstanding centre of political and cultural life, and is titled \"the city of a thousand minarets\" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture. Cairo's historic center was awarded World Heritage Site status in 1979. Cairo is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification according to GaWC. The city is also a center of finance and commerce, academics and the arts, and is home to Cairo Symphony Orchestra and the Cairo Opera House, while the Academy of Arts provides visual arts education. Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industry in the Arab world, as well as Egypt's oldest institution of higher learning, Al-Azhar University. Many international media, businesses, and organisations have regional headquarters in Cairo. The Arab League has had its headquarters in Cairo for most of its existence.\nCairo, like many other megacities, suffers from high levels of pollution and traffic. The Cairo Metro, opened in 1987, is the oldest metro system in Africa, and ranks amongst the fifteen busiest in the world, with over 1 billion annual passenger rides. The economy of Cairo was ranked first in the Middle East in 2005, and 43rd globally on Foreign Policy's 2010 Global Cities Index.",

      "title": "القاهرة",
      "content": "القَاهِرَه هي عاصمه جمهوريه مصر العربيه واكبر واهم مدنها، وتعد اكبر مدينه عربيه من حيث تعداد السكان والمساحه، وتحتل المركز الثاني افريقيًا والسابع عشر عالميًا من حيث التعداد السكاني، كما انها جزء من اكبر تجمع حضري في افريقيا والوطن العربي والشرق الاوسط. تعد منطقه القاهره الكبرى الثانيه عشره من حيث عدد السكان في العالم حيث يبلغ عدد سكانها 21,322,750 مليون نسمه حسب احصائيات عام 2021. يمثلون 20% من اجمالي تعداد سكان مصر اكثر من (107 مليون نسمه).\nتعد مدينه القاهره من اكثر المدن تنوعاً ثقافياً وحضارياً، حيث شهدت العديد من الحقب التاريخيه المختلفه على مر العصور، وتوجد فيها العديد من المعالم القديمه والحديثه، فاصبحت متحفاً مفتوحاً يضم اثاراً فرعونيه ويونانيه ورومانيه وقبطيه واسلاميه. يعود تاريخ المدينه الى نشاه مدينه اون الفرعونيه او هليوبوليس «عين شمس حالياً» والتي تعد واحده من اقدم مدن العالم القديم. اما القاهره بطرازها الحالي فيعود تاريخ انشائها الى الفتح الاسلامي لمصر على يد عمرو بن العاص عام 641 م وانشائه مدينه الفسطاط، ثم انشاء العباسيين لمدينه العسكر، فبناء احمد بن طولون لمدينه القطائع، ومع دخول الفاطميين مصر قادمين من افريقيه (تونس حالياً) بدا القائد جوهر الصقلي في بناء العاصمه الجديده للدوله الفاطميه بامر من الخليفه الفاطمي المعز لدين الله وذلك في عام 969م، واطلق عليها الخليفه اسم «القاهره». واطلق على القاهره- على مر العصور- العديد من الاسماء، فهي مدينه الالف مئذنه ومصر المحروسه وقاهره المعز. شهدت القاهره خلال العصر الاسلامي ارقى فنون العماره التي تمثلت في بناء القلاع والحصون والاسوار والمدارس والمساجد، مما منحها لمحهً جماليهً لا زالت موجوده باحيائها القديمه حتى الان.\nوتعد القاهره محافظه ومدينه، اي انها محافظه تشغل كامل مساحتها مدينه واحده، وفي نفس الوقت مدينه كبيره تشكل محافظه بذاتها، وتنقسم الى 37 حياً، وتحتفل القاهره بعيدها القومي في 6 يوليو من كل عام، وهو اليوم الذي يوافق وضع القائد جوهر الصقلي حجر اساس المدينه عام 969م، ليبلغ عمر القاهره الان ما يربو على 1055 عام.\nتعد القاهره ايضاً مقراً للعديد من المنظمات الاقليميه والعالميه، حيث يقع بها مقر جامعه الدول العربيه، والمكتب الاقليمي لكل من: منظمه الصحه العالميه، منظمه الاغذيه والزراعه، منظمه الطيران المدني الدولي، الاتحاد الدولي للاتصالات، صندوق الامم المتحده للسكان، هيئه الامم المتحده للمراه، مقر برنامج الامم المتحده الانمائي، مكتب تنسيق الشؤون الانسانيه للامم المتحده، وكذلك مقر الاتحاد الافريقي لكره السله.\n\nالتسميه\nاختلفت الاقاويل حول سبب تسميه القاهره بهذا الاسم، فقيل ان جوهر الصقلي سمى المدينه في اول الامر المنصوريه تيمناً باسم مدينه المنصوريه التي انشاها خارج القيروان المنصور بالله والد المعز لدين الله، او تيمناً باسم والد المعز نفسه احياءً لذكراه، واستمر هذا الاسم حتى قدم المعز الى مصر فاطلق عليها اسم «القاهره»، وذلك بعد مرور اربع سنوات على تاسيسها، تفاؤلاً بانها ستقهر الدوله العباسيه المنافسه للفاطميين، وقيل انه سماها بالقاهره لتقهر الدنيا، او انها سميت نسبه الى الكوكب القاهر وهو كوكب المريخ. ولمدينه القاهره عده اسماء شهيره منها مصر المحروسه، قاهره المعز، مدينه الالف مئذنه، جوهره الشرق.\n\nالتاريخ\nاكتسبت القاهره مكانتها وتاثيرها على مختلف الحضارات بفضل موقعها الاستراتيجي الذي اختاره لها اهل مصر منذ فجر الحضاره، وتميزت عن بقيه العواصم التاريخيه بصفه الاستمرار، فشكل تطورها سلسله من الحلقات بدات مع مدينه اون في عهد ما قبل الاسرات والتي كانت بمثابه العاصمه الدينيه بعد توحيد البلاد وبدايه عهد الاسرات على يد الملك مينا بينما كانت منف هي اول عاصمه اداريه وسياسيه لمصر بعد استقرار الوحده. وعرفت اون فيما بعد بالاسم الاغريقي هليوبوليس او عين شمس حالياً. عقب الفتح الاسلامي لمصر سنه 18 هـ/639 م، شيد عمرو بن العاص مدينه الفسطاط سنه 21 هـ/641 م، وبنى جامع عرف باسمه، ثم اختطت اماكن اقامه القبائل العربيه. وعقب قيام الدوله العباسيه والقضاء على الدوله الامويه انشا العباسيون مدينه العسكر في مكان عرف باسم الحمراء القصوى يقع شمال شرق الفسطاط واقاموا فيه دورهم ومساكنهم، وشيد فيها صالح بن علي دار الاماره وثكن الجند، ثم شيد الفضل بن صالح مسجد العسكر، وبمرور الايام اتصلت العسكر بالفسطاط واصبحتا مدينه كبيره خطت فيها الطرق وشيدت بها المساجد والاسواق. وذلك الى ان تولى احمد بن طولون حكم مصر وراى ان مدينه العسكر لا تتسع لحاشيته وجنده، فصعد الى جبل المقطم وراى بين العسكر والمقطم ارض فضاء فاختط في موضعها مدينته الجديده التي سميت القطائع. وبعد قرابه مائه عام على انشاء القطائع دخل الفاطميون مصر بقياده جوهر الصقلي موفداً من الخليفه المعز لدين الله، فاخذ في وضع اساس «القاهره» شمال شرقي القطائع، كما وضع اساس القصر الفاطمي الكبير، وشرع بجانبه في بناء الجامع الازهر.\n\nالعصور القديمه\nاون\nكانت مدينه اون القديمه وموقعها حالياً منطقه المطريه وعين شمس من ابرز مراكز الثقافه المصريه القديمه وذكرت في المتون المصريه القديمه باسماء «اونو افق السماء» و«انو سماء مصر» واعتبرتها مقر الالهه المختاره وموطن ميلاد كل معبود، وسميت المدينه في القبطيه «اونو»، وفي اليونانيه «هليوبوليس» بمعنى مدينه الشمس. كان للمدينه ماضيها السياسي حيث تعد واحده من اقدم عواصم مصر المتحده في فجر التاريخ وذلك نتيجه لجهود زعمائها الذين اقاموا بها اول وحده للوجهين سبقت الوحده التي تمت على يد الملك مينا. وكفل للمدينه شهرتها في الفلسفه والدين قدم مذهبها في تفسير نشاه الوجود. اما في الفلك ترجع شهره المدينه الى ابتكار التقويم الشمسي الذي تميزت به الحضاره المصريه. وعلى الرغم من ان مدينه اون لم تلعب دوراً سياسياً بارزاً في العصور التاريخيه الا انها ظلت محتفظه بمكانتها الثقافيه والحضاريه والدينيه وحرص الملوك على ترك اثارهم بها على مر العصور، واسفرت الحفائر الحديثه عن الكثير من الاثار التي تدل على ذلك منها الجزء العلوي لمسله صغيره من الحجر الرملي تعود الى عهد الملك تتي من الدوله القديمه. ومن اثار عصر الدوله الوسطى، مسله من الجرانيت الاحمر اقامها الملك سنوسرت الاول، وبقايا مسله للفرعون تحتمس الثالث، وعدد من اللوحات من الحجر الجيري وجزء من تمثال اثري. ومن اثار عصر الدوله الحديثه، عمود مرنبتاج الموجود في منطقه المعابد، وتمثال الملك سيتي الثاني من الحجر الجيري، وبقايا معبد للملك رمسيس الثالث، وعدد من تيجان الاعمده واجزاء من اعمده وتماثيل لابو الهول.\n\nبابليون\nتقع مدينه بابليون في منطقه القاهره القبطيه حالياً، وقام بانشائها رمسيس الثاني واتخذت اسمها من اسرى البابليين الذين ثاروا عليه، فبنى بها القلعه التي اعتقلهم فيها، ثم اطلق الاسم على المدينه باكملها. واشتهرت المدينه في العصر الروماني في عهد الامبراطور اغسطس، وامر باعاده بنائها الامبراطور تراجان عام 130 ق.م وحول الحصن الى مدينه عسكريه، ورمم الحصن ووسعه الامبراطور الروماني اركاديوس في القرن الرابع الميلادي. استعمل في بناء الحصن احجار اخذت من معابد فرعونيه واكملت بالطوب الاحمر ولم يبق من مباني الحصن حالياً سوى الباب القبلي الذي يكتنفه برجان كبيران، وبنى فوق احد البرجين الكنيسه المعلقه، كما بني فوق البرج الاخر كنيسه مار جرجس الروماني للروم الارثوذكس، وعلى باقي السور بنيت كنيسه القديس ابو سرجه وكنيسه العذراء وقصريه الريحان ودير مار جرجس للراهبات وكنيسه القديسه برباره ومعبد لليهود. يعرف الحصن الروماني بقصر الشمع او قلعه بابليون وتبلغ مساحته حوالي نصف كيلومتر مربع، ويقع بداخله المتحف القبطي. في عام 641 م سقط الحصن في يد عمرو بن العاص بعد حصار دام نحو سبعه اشهر في 18 ربيع الاخر 20 هـ/16 ابريل 641 م، وكان سقوطه ايذاناً بدخول الاسلام في مصر. اختار عمرو بن العاص مكان استراتيجي شمال حصن بابليون واقام فيه مدينه الفسطاط وداخلها حصن بابليون لتكون مدينه للجند العرب.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nالفسطاط\nاتخذت الفسطاط اسمها من خيمه عمرو بن العاص التي اقامها في وسط معسكره، وانشاها عمرو بن العاص شمال حصن بابليون، وامر بتخطيطها لتكون اول عاصمه للاسلام في مصر بدلاً من الاسكندريه، وفي وسط المدينه اقام مسجداً للصلاه سمي باسمه واشتهر بمناراته الاربعه، وخططت الارض حوله الى احياء، وولى عمرو بن العاص اربعه من المسلمين لتنظيم المدينه وهم معاويه بن خديج التجيبي، شريك بن سمي الغطيفي، عمرو بن محزم الخولاني، جبريل بن ناشره المعافري. اشتهرت الفسطاط بشوارعها المرصوفه ومنازلها الفسيحه التي تتوسطها نافورات المياه والحدائق الداخليه، وتعددت بالمدينه الاسواق التي كان يقع معظمها على شاطئ نهر النيل وذلك بخلاف الاسواق حول الجامع. تميز اختيار موقع المدينه بسهوله الدفاع عنه لاسباب طبيعيه فالنيل يحدها من الغرب وجبل المقطم من الشرق واللذان شكلا حاجزا طبيعياً ضد اي اعتداء خارجي.\n\nالعسكر\nالعسكر هي ثاني العواصم الاسلاميه في مصر، وانشاها العباسيون في مكان عرف باسم الحمراء القصوى يقع شمال شرق الفسطاط، واقاموا فيه دورهم ومساكنهم، وشيد فيه صالح بن علي دار الاماره وثكنات الجند او دار العسكر، ومنه اتخذت المدينه اسمها، ثم شيد الفضل بن صالح مسجد العسكر. تعتبر المدينه امتداداً للاتجاهات التخطيطيه والعمرانيه لمدينه الفسطاط، وعظمت بها العماره وشيدت المساكن والقصور وتوسع عمرانها حتى التحمت بالفسطاط، وحكم مصر منها 65 والياً على امتداد 120 عاماً، ويرجح ان موقعها كان بالقرب من حي السيده زينب حالياً.\n\nالقطائع\nالقطائع هي المدينه التي اسسها احمد بن طولون، لتصبح بذلك ثالث عاصمه اسلاميه في مصر، ويرجع اسمها الى نظام تخطيطها المنقول عن مدينه سامراء التي شب فيها بن طولون، وهو التخطيط المتقاطع المكون من قطع سكنيه كل منها لجماعه من السكان تربطهم رابطه او طبقه او مستوى واحد، يطلق عليها اسم القطع. شيدت المدينه في الارض الفضاء بين مدينه العسكر وجبل المقطم، ووضعت اولى خططها عام 256 هـ/870 م، وبعد ست سنوات في عام 876 م احتفل ابن طولون بوضع اساس الجامع الذي سمي باسمه على جبل يشكر، والذي انتهى بناؤه في سنتين، ويقع في وسط المدينه، ويعد من اكبر مساجد العالم الاسلامي بمساحه تبلغ 26500 متر مربع، واشتهر باسم الجامع المعلق اذ يصعد الى ابوابه بسلالم دائريه الشكل، كما انشا ابن طولون اول مستشفى في مصر بمنطقه البساتين. وانتقل الى المدينه كل من له صله بالحكم او اداره البلاد وافراد الجيش، ولم يكن مسموحاً للعامه بالسكن فيها. ظلت القطائع عاصمه مصر خلال الحكم الطولوني الذي استمر 27 عاماً حتى سنه 293 هـ/905 م، مع قدوم الجيش العباسي الى مصر، والذي محى القطائع وحولها الى اطلال مع الابقاء على الجامع، وعادت مدينه العسكر مقراً للحكم حتى دخول الفاطميين.\n\nقاهره المعز\nبعد قرابه المائه عام على انشاء القطائع، قدم الى مصر جيش الفاطميين من المغرب بقياده جوهر الصقلي موفداً من الخليفه المعز لدين الله، ووصل الى الفسطاط في 11 شعبان 358 هـ/يوليو 969 م، ودخلها في اليوم التالي، ونزل مع جنوده في الفراغ الواقع شمال شرقي القطائع واخذ في وضع اساس القاعده الفاطميه الجديده في 17 شعبان 385 هـ/7 يوليو 969 م، والتي سماها «القاهره»، كما وضع اساس القصر الفاطمي الكبير في 18 شعبان 358 هـ، وشرع بجانبه في بناء الجامع الازهر في جمادي الاول سنه 359 هـ/ابريل 970 م. انشئت المدينه على مساحه 340 فدان، وبني حولها سور من اللبن مربع الشكل طول كل من ضلعيه الشمالي والجنوبي 1500 ذراع، وضلعيه الشرقي والغربي 1700 ذراع، وبكل ضلع من اضلاع السور بوابتان، فالضلع الشمالي به باب النصر وباب الفتوح، والشرقي به باب البرقيه (الغريب) والقراطين (المحروق)، والجنوبي يواجه الفسطاط عند باب الخلق وبه باب زويله (المتولي) وباب الفرج، والغربي به باب القنطره وباب سعاده. بدات المدينه كمدينه عسكريه تشتمل على مساكن الامراء ودواوين الحكومه وخزائن المال، وفي سنه 973 تحولت الى عاصمه الدوله الفاطميه عندما انتقل اليها المعز لدين الله من المغرب، واطلق عليها قاهره المعز. بعد انقضاء 120 سنه من تاسيس القاهره راى امير الجيوش بدر الجمالي وكان وزيراً للخليفه المستنصر بالله ان الناس شيدوا خارج سور القاهره بسبب اتساع العمران، فاحاطها بسور وصله بسور جوهر عام 480 هـ/1087 م، واقام السور الجديد من اللبن والابواب من الحجاره.\n\nالعصر الايوبي\nارسل السلطان نور الدين محمود حمله الى مصر لطرد الصليبيين بقياده اسد الدين شيركوه، الذي اصطحب معه صلاح الدين ابن اخيه نجم الدين ايوب. وعقب وفاه شيركوه ولي الخليفه العاضد صلاح الدين وزاره مصر، فاصبح بذلك الرجل الاول في الدوله. ثم استبد صلاح الدين بالامور وضعف امر العاضد وهدم دار المعرفه وبناها مدرسه شافعيه وبنى دار الغزل للمالكيه وعزل قضاه الشيعه واقام قاضياً شافعياً في مصر واستناب في جميع البلاد. وبدلاً من ان ينشئ صلاح الدين عاصمه جديده، اتجه الى ضم ضواحي المدينه الاربعه (الفسطاط والعسكر والقطائع والقاهره الفاطميه) لتكون معاً عاصمه الدوله، فخرجت القاهره عن نطاق اسوارها القديمه وامتد تخطيطها ليصل الى قلعه الجبل، التي ظلت مقراً لحكم مصر في مختلف العصور التي تلت حكم الايوبيين، وحتى عصر الخديوي اسماعيل الذي نقل مقر الحكم الى قصر عابدين. وفي عام 569 هـ انتدب بهاء الدين قراقوش لمد سور حول القاهره بحدودها الجديده، فزاد في سور القاهره الممتد من باب القتطره الى باب الشعريه، ومن باب الشعريه الى باب البحر، ثم زاد في الجزء الذي يلي باب النصر الى برج الظفر ومن هذا البرج الى برج البرقيه ومنه الى درب بطوط والى خارج باب الوزير ليتصل بسور قلعه الجبل. ومن معالم تلك الحقبه التي ما زالت باقيه، سواقي عيون بئر يوسف وقناطر مجرى المياه التي تحمل المياه الى القلعه.\n\nالعصر المملوكي\nيعد عصر المماليك هو العصر الذهبي للقاهره، ولا سيما بعدما خفت وطاه الحروب الصليبيه في الشام، وانتصر المماليك على المغول. ففي عهد الظاهر بيبرس امتدت القاهره في اتجاه الشمال خارج اسوارها في حي الحسينيه، وشيد مسجداً رائعاً يعرف اليوم باسم جامع الظاهر وكان اسمه قديماً جامع الصافيه، كما شيد العديد من المباني في قلعه صلاح الدين كدار الذهب، وانشا الاسواق والجسور والقناطر، وشاركه امراؤه في بناء العديد من العمائر والرباع والخانات والدور والمساجد والحمامات التي اضافت لمسه من الجلال والجمال على المدينه.\n\n وفي عهد اسره قلاوون التي حكمت مصر قرابه المائه عام، شيد المنصور قلاوون طائفه من العمائر النادره، منها مدرسه الجليله وقبته او ضريحه، وانشا المارستان وجعله وقفاً لجميع الطوائف من الملك حتى العبيد، وما زال جزء منه قائماً الى اليوم. وفي ايام السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون، امتدت القاهره جهه الشمال عبر الصحراء والشمال الغربي والغرب ايضاً بما طرحه النيل من طمي اثمر تدريجياً عن ارض جديده غرب القاهره، فلم يترك امراء المماليك قطعه ارض داخل القاهره الا واقاموا فيها المساجد والمدارس والحمامات والسبل والوكالات والاضرحه، فعم الرخاء على المدينه وازدهرت التجاره وتسابق الامراء والاعيان على تشييد ابهى فنون العماره. واحب السلطان الناصر العماره فرصع القاهره بافخم المباني، وانشا تحت قلعه صلاح الدين ميداناً للالعاب والمسابقات بين الامراء، وعمر كثيراً من القصور داخل القلعه، وشيد جامعه ذا المئذنتين الذي ما زال قائماً حتى الان، وفي ايامه زار مصر الرحاله المسلم ابن بطوطه في عام 1326 فقال عنها «قهرت قاهرتها الامم، وتملكت ملوكها نواصي العرب والعجم»، وفي اثناء حكم المماليك البحريه ولد المؤرخ تقي الدين المقريزي، الذي الف موسوعه هامه عن خطط مصر وعن القاهره بوجه خاص وصفت جمال عماره القاهره وفنونها. وفي ايام السلطان حسن بن قلاوون شيدت عماره جليله تمثلت في مدرسه ومسجد السلطان حسن، الذي يعد اجمل مساجد القاهره. وفي عهد المماليك الجراكسه ظهر حبهم للعمائر الجميله والذوق السليم، فشيد سلاطينهم وامراؤهم العمائر والمساجد ومنها مسجد الملك الظاهر برقوق بجوار مدرسه الناصر قلاوون، وخانقاه الملك الناصر بن برقوق، وهي بناء ضخم صمم ليخدم عده اغراض، فهو ضريح لال برقوق ومدرسه للعلوم ومسجد وخانقاه فخمه، ومسجد الملك المؤيد شيخ بجوار باب زويله، ومسجد السلطان الاشرف برسباي، ومسجد السلطان الاشرف قايتباي، ومسجد السلطان قنصوه الغوري.\n\nالعصر العثماني\nاستولى السلطان سليم على مصر وشرع في تاييد سلطته، فجعل عليها حاكماً يلقب بالباشا، وليضمن عدم خروج الباشا على الاستانه ويستقل بمصر، جعل في مصر ثلاث ادارات كل منها يراقب الاخر، حتى لا يخشى من اتحادها او تمردها، فكانت القوه الاولى هي «الباشا» واهم واجباته هي ابلاغ الاوامر السلطانيه لرجال الحكومه والشعب ومراقبه تنفيذها، والقوه الثانيه هي «الوجاقات الست» وواجبها هو حفظ النظام والدفاع عن القطر المصري، وتوزعت في القاهره والمراكز الرئيسيه، اما القوه الثالثه فهي «المماليك» وهم بقايا المماليك البحريه والجراكسه، وواجبهم حفظ التوازن بين الباشا والوجاقات لانهم اعداء لكلا الفريقين. وظل امراء المماليك هم اصحاب القوه الفعليه بالبلاد، وزاد نفوذهم مع تقلص نفوذ الباب العالي وتقلص نفوذ ولاته في مصر. ومن اثار تلك الحقبه التي ما زالت باقيه مسجد محمد بك ابو الذهب تجاه الجامع الازهر، وعمائر عبد الرحمن كتخدا «محافظ مصر»، والذي كان مغرماً بالبناء فانشا وجدد الكثير من المساجد والسبل والاضرحه، وكان في مقدمه الساعين لتجميل القاهره، ويتجلى ذلك في سبيله الرائع الواقع في ملتقى شارعي النحاسيين والجماليه والمعروف باسمه حتى اليوم، كما انشا بالقرب من باب الفتوح مسجداً وكتاباً، وزاد في مقصوره الجامع الازهر وبنى به محراباً جديداً واقام له منبراً وانشا له باباً عظيماً وبنى باعلاه مكتباً لتعليم الايتام من اطفال المسلمين، وبنى المدرسه الطيبرسيه، وانشا عند باب البرقيه «باب الغريب» جامعاً ومكتباً، وجامعاً ومكتباً وساقيه ومناره جهه الازبكيه، كما بنى المشهد الحسيني، ومشاهد السيده زينب والسيده سكينه والسيده عائشه والسيده فاطمه والسيده رقيه، وجدد المارستان المنصوري، وكانت دار سكناه بحاره عابدين من الدور العظيمه المحكمه الوضع والاتقان.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nعصر الاسره العلويه\nاسس محمد علي الاسره العلويه في مصر وارسى خلال حكمه اسس النهضه الحديثه، وانتقل بمصر من الاضمحلال الذي سيطر عليها خلال حكم العثمانيين الى مشارف العصر الحديث، وارتقى بها الى رتب الدول المتقدمه. ادرك محمد علي بعبقريته الفطريه الفذه ان السبيل لبناء النهضه هو الارتقاء بالعلوم والاداره والصناعه والزراعه، فانشا المدارس الحديثه وارسل البعثات العلميه واعاد تنظيم الجيش والاداره الحكوميه وشيد دور الصناعه بانواعها والتي تركزت بمنطقه السبتيه، كما اقام الجسور والقناطر وحفر الترع. واهتم محمد علي بالقاهره فامر بتنظيم وتوسيع وتنظيف واناره شوارعها، وازال الانقاض المحيطه بها وردم بها بركها، وكون في عام 1834 مجلساً للاشراف على تجميل القاهره، كما استقدم الفنانين والعمال المهره من فرنسا وايطاليا وتركيا لبناء القصور واشترط عليهم تعيين اربعه من المصريين مع كل منهم ليتعلموا حرفتهم، ومن اشهر القصور التي شيدها قصر الجوهره وقصر القبه وقصر الحرم وقصر الازبكيه وقصر النيل، وقام ايضاً ببناء جامعه بالقلعه، والذي تم تصميمه على غرار مسجد السلطان احمد بالاستانه. وفي ابريل 1847 انتقلت ولايه مصر من محمد علي الى ابراهيم باشا، والذي اهتم بتقويه الجيش والاسطول ونظم جمعيه الحقانيه لتنظيم سير القضايا، وشيد قصر الروضه والقصر العالي، وفي عهده تم ردم بركه الازبكيه تماماً وحولت الى متنزه ضخم. وفي عهد عباس باشا الاول منح امتياز انشاء خط سكك حديديه بين القاهره والاسكندريه للبريطانيين عام 1851، وانشئ حي العباسيه في صحراء شمال شرق القاهره عام 1849 بغرض اقامه ثكنات عسكريه، كما اقام فيها سراي الباشا او «سراي الحصوه» ومدرسه حربيه ومستشفى. عقب وفاه عباس الاول ال حكم مصر الى سعيد باشا، فافتتح في عهده خط السكك الحديديه بين القاهره والاسكندريه عام 1854، وانشئت المحطه الرئيسيه للسكك الحديديه بباب الحديد عام 1856، وبوفاته انتقل حكم مصر الى اسماعيل باشا عام 1863.\n\nعصر الخديوي اسماعيل\nيعود لقب القاهره الخديويه الى اول حاكم لمصر يحمل هذا اللقب وهو الخديوي اسماعيل، والذي تولى عرش مصر في 18 يناير 1863، فمنح القاهره وجهاً جديداً متالقاً، وحدد معالمها الحضاريه من خلال انجازات بقيت محفوره على جدران مبانيها وشوارعها الحديثه. كانت القاهره عند تولي اسماعيل باشا عرش مصر يبلغ تعدادها 270 الف نسمه وتمتد من منطقه القلعه بسفح المقطم شرقاً الى مدافن الازبكيه وميدان العتبه والمناصره غرباً، وساد على احيائها الانحلال العمراني مما اثار حماس اسماعيل باشا لصنع ثوره عمرانيه بعاصمه البلاد ترقى بها الى مصاف العواصم الاوروبيه، ولتكون «باريس الشرق»، فطلب اسماعيل باشا من الامبراطور نابليون الثالث ان يقوم هاوسمان المهندس العالمي بتخطيط القاهره على غرار التخطيط الجديد لباريس، واستغرق اعداد وتصميم وتنفيذ المشروع خمس سنوات، وفي عام 1872 افتتح الخديوي اسماعيل شارع محمد علي «القلعه»، كما شق شارع «كلوت بك» عام 1875، وانشا دار الاوبرا، والكتب خانه، وكان من اهم القصور التي شيدت خلال تلك الحقبه قصر عابدين، الذي بدا انشاؤه في غام 1863، واصبح مقر الحكم بدلاً من القلعه في عهد الخديوي اسماعيل، ويعود اسم القصر الى انه بني مكان قصر «عابدين بك»، وطلب اسماعيل باشا الاحتفاظ باسم عابدين للقصر وميدانه. وفي فتره لاحقه انشئ كوبري قصر النيل وكوبري ابو العلا ليصلا القاهره بجزيره الزمالك والجيزه، وادخل خط الترام الى شوارع القاهره عام 1896 لربط العتبه الخضراء بالعباسيه.\n\nالقاهره المعاصره\nفي بدايه القرن العشرين شهدت مدينه القاهره تطوراً هائلاً نتيجه قدوم رجال الاعمال الاجانب، وتم انشاء العديد من الوكالات والمحال التجاريه والتي اصبحت فيما بعد علامات تجاريه شهيره مثل جروبي وغيره، كذلك شهدت توسعاً من خلال ربط شبرا بالقاهره عام 1902، وربط حي الظاهر بالسيده زينب وغرب الازبكيه عام 1903، وبدا نمو حي الفجاله وحي التوفيقيه، كما بدا انشاء حي جاردن سيتي عام 1906، وتعمير حي الزمالك عام 1905، وبدا العمل في ضاحيه مصر الجديده عام 1906، اما ضاحيه المعادي فنشات عام 1907.\nوخلال ثوره 1919 كانت القاهره هي مركز الاحتجاجات والتي كانت تتخذ من بيت سعد زغلول (بيت الامه) مقراً لها، وعقب الثوره والانتهاء من تاسيس بنك مصر اصبحت القاهره مركز ومقر للعديد من الشركات والمشروعات المصريه التي نشات واحده تلو الاخرى، وبلغت القاهره في العشرينيات مستوى عال من الرقي والتحضر، ففي عام 1921 تم اختيارها لتنظيم مؤتمر القاهره الذي جمع العديد من قاده اوروبا والشرق الاوسط لبحث تداعيات الحرب العالميه الاولى، كذلك في عام 1925 حصلت على وسام اجمل وانظف مدينه في دول حوض البحر المتوسط باعتبارها مدينه الاناقه في تصميم مبانيها ونظافه شوارعها وانتظام حركه المرور بها.\n\nوفي نوفمبر 1943 اثناء الحرب العالميه الثانيه، شهدت القاهره اجتماع قاده الحلفاء في مؤتمر القاهره والذي حضره الرئيس فرانكلين روزفلت وونستون تشرشل والقائد الصيني تشان كاي شيك ورئيس وزراء تركيا عصمت اينونو، وكان المؤتمر بمثابه نقطه فارقه بصدور اعلان القاهره الذي تم التوقيع عليه يوم 27 نوفمبر 1943 ونص على نشر قوات في فرنسا وضروره انسحاب اليابان من المقاطعات الصينيه، واستمرار المعارك حتى الاستسلام غير المشروط.\n\nوفي 26 يناير 1952 عقب وقوع موقعه الاسماعيليه يوم 25 يناير بين القوات البريطانيه وقوات الشرطه المصريه، قام مجهولون باشعال حرائق في مدينه القاهره التهمت الكثير من الاماكن العامه والفنادق والسينيمات والمحلات تجاريه والمكاتب، كما اسفرت عن عشرات الضحايا. ادت تلك الاحداث الى استقاله وزاره الوفد ذات الشعبيه الجماهيريه، وتولى الوزاره علي ماهر باشا، واعلنت الاحكام العرفيه في البلاد، وتلاها في يوليو قيام الضباط الاحرار بالتحرك كبدايه لاحداث ثوره 23 يوليو، وكانت القاهره محطه فاصله في تلك الاحداث، بالرغم من ان الملك فاروق وحاشيته كانوا بالاسكندريه، الا ان حصار قصر عابدين والاستيلاء على القياده العامه للجيش المصري تسبب في رضوخ الملك فاروق لمطالب الحركه، ووافق على مغادره البلاد في 26 يوليو والتنازل عن العرش لابنه.\nوعقب حرب 1967 ونتيجه للمعارك تم اجلاء سكان محافظات القناه (بورسعيد، الاسماعيليه، السويس)، وكانت القاهره من اكثر المحافظات استقبالاً للنازحين والتي كانت باعداد كبيره، تسببت في اندلاع الازمه العقاريه وقتها وارتفاع اسعارها بشكل متزايد، وترتب عليها ظهور العديد من المناطق السكنيه مثل منشاه ناصر وغيرها.\n\nوفي اعقاب حرب اكتوبر وبدايه عصر الانفتاح الاقتصادي شهدت القاهره موجه هجره واسعه من سكان الاقاليم بغرض التعليم او العمل، وترتب عليها تغير ديموغرافيا المدينه عما كانت عليه، حيث بدات عمليات هدم القصور القديمه لبناء ابنيه سكنيه وكذلك شهدت فتره الثمانينات والتسعينيات اوسع عمليات التعدي والبناء على الاراضي الزراعيه، مما ترتب عليها فقدان القاهره معظم مساحاتها الخضراء. شهد الربع الاخير من القرن العشرين مرحله بناء المدن الجديده، فبعد انشاء مدينه نصر في عهد ناصر ومدينه 15 مايو ومدينه السلام في عهد السادات، شهد عهد مبارك انشاء القاهره الجديده ومدينه بدر والشروق، وشهد ايضاً تشغيل مترو الانفاق وانشاء الطريق الدائري ليكون اكبر طريق بري يربط القاهره الكبرى ببعضها.\nفي 25 يناير 2011 انطلقت مجموعه من التظاهرات والاحتجاجات الشعبيه ذات الطابع الاجتماعي والسياسي، وكان ميدان التحرير بالقاهره ابرز اماكن هذه المظاهرات حيث شهد اعداداً وصفت بالمليونيه، كما شهدت القاهره ايضاً احداث لاحقه مثل احداث مسرح البالون، احداث ماسبيرو، احداث محمد محمود، احداث مجلس الوزراء، احداث العباسيه.\nوعقب تولي محمد مرسي رئاسه الجمهوريه اتخذ عده اجراءات واصدر قرارات اثارت ضده احتجاجات ومظاهرات، كان ابرزها احداث قصر الاتحاديه مما اسفر عن وقوع ضحايا، وفي 30 يونيو 2013 خرجت مظاهرات حاشده من المعارضين لحكم محمد مرسي في الميادين المصريه وعلى راسها ميدان التحرير مطالبين بانتخابات رئاسيه مبكره ورحيل النظام.\n\nتوسعات المدينه\nاعتمدت الحكومه المصريه خطه استراتيجيه قوميه لغزو الصحراء واقامه مجتمعات عمرانيه جديده خارج وادي النيل ودلتاه لتكون مراكز حضاريه ومناطق جذب سكاني واقتصادي بهدف اعاده توزيع السكان والانشطه المختلفه توزيعاً متوازناً على انحاء جمهوريه مصر العربيه، وبدات تلك المشاريع خلال العهد الملكي مع انشاء ضاحيه مصر الجديده «هليوبوليس» التي تعد اهم التجارب على مستوى العالم في مجال انشاء المدن الجديده خلال النصف الاول من القرن العشرين، والتي تعود فكره انشائها الى عام 1905، واستوحي تخطيطها من المدن الحدائقيه التي شيدت في اوروبا نهايه القرن التاسع عشر، فكان انتشار الفراغات الحضريه الكبيره والشوارع المستقيمه المتسعه والتي خططت في هيئه حي عمراني راق يضاهي الاحياء الاوروبيه. وفي اعقاب ثوره 23 يوليو 1952 انشئت مدينه نصر بقرار من الرئيس جمال عبد الناصر بهدف التوسع العمراني في المنطقه الصحراويه شمال شرق القاهره وخصوصاً شرق حي العباسيه بعيداً عن الاراضي الزراعيه، واعطى اشاره البدء لانشاء مدينه متكامله باسلوب حضاري راق وطريقه عمرانيه متميزه اطلق عليها «مدينه نصر». نفذ التخطيط الاولي والتصاميم المعماريه لمشروع المدينه المهندس المعماري سيد كريم، على مساحه تصل لاكثر من 250 كم مربع وتمتد في الشرق من طريق مصر/السويس حتى الكيلو 51 وتقاطعه مع طريق القطاميه، وفي الغرب من شارع صلاح سالم وفي الشمال حي مصر الجديده وفي الجنوب المقطم. وفي عام 1978 بدا انشاء مدينه 15 مايو التي تعد احدى مدن الجيل الاول من المجتمعات العمرانيه الجديده التي قامت بانشائها وزاره الاسكان والتي تعود تسميتها نسبه الى ثوره التصحيح في 15 مايو 1971، ويربط مدينه 15 مايو بالقاهره طريقان رئيسيان هما كورنيش النيل وطريق الاوتوستراد، وبدات في استقبال سكانها بعد عامين فقط من البدء في تنفيذها. وفي عام 1979 صدر قرار انشاء مدينه القاهره الجديده والتي توسعت باحيائها المعروفه الامل والرحاب ومدينتي والتجمع الاول والثالث والخامس.\nوفي عام 1982 صدر قرار رئيس مجلس الوزراء بانشاء مدينه بدر بطريق القاهره/السويس على مساحه 18454.43 فدان، منها 7018 فدان مناطق سكنيه، و2173 فدان مناطق خدميه. وفي عام 1995 صدر قرار جمهوري بانشاء مدينه الشروق على مساحه 16.11 الف فدان منها 9200 فدان كتله عمرانيه، اضيف اليها 5302 فدان عام 2015.\n\nالجغرافيا والسكان\nالموقع\nتقع القاهره على جوانب جزر نهر النيل في شمال مصر، مباشره جنوب شرق النقطه التي يترك فيها نهر النيل واديه محصوراً فيِ الصحراء منقسماً الى فرعين داخل منطقه دلتا النيل المنخفضه. بني الجزء الغربي على نموذج مدينه باريس مِن قبل حاكم مصر الخديوي اسماعيل في منتصف القرن التاسع عشر، والذي تميز بالاحياء الواسعه والحدائق العامه والمناطق المفتوحه. اما القسم الشرقي الاقدم للمدينه فتوسع بشكل عشوائي على مدى القرون، وامتلا بالطرقِ الصغيره والمباني المزدحمه. بينما يمتلئ غرب القاهره بالبنايات الحكوميه والهندسه المعماريه الحديثه، واصبح الجزء الاهم في القاهره، ويحوي النصف الشرقي الاثار التاريخيه للمدينه على مر العصور لما يوجد به من مساجد وكنائس عتيقه ومباني اثريه ومعالم قديمه، كما توسعت المدينه شرقاً بانشاء حي مدينه نصر الذي يعتبر من اكبر احياء القاهره.\n\nالتقسيم الاداري\nتنقسم المدينه الى اربع مناطق رئيسيه هي:\n\nالمنطقه الشرقيه وتضم 9 احياء هي: (اول السلام، ثان السلام، المرج، عين شمس، المطريه، مصر الجديده، النزهه، غرب مدينه نصر، شرق مدينه نصر).\nالمنطقه الغربيه وتضم 9 احياء هي: (الوايلي، باب الشعريه، منشاه ناصر، عابدين، الموسكي، الازبيكه، بولاق، وسط، غرب).\nالمنطقه الشماليه وتضم 8 احياء هي: (الزيتون، حدائق القبه، الاميريه، الزاويه الحمراء، الشرابيه، الساحل، شبرا، روض الفرج).\nالمنطقه الجنوبيه وتضم 11 حي هم: (السيده زينب، مصر القديمه، الخليفه، المقطم، البساتين، دار السلام، المعادي، طره، حلوان، التبين، 15 مايو).\n\nالمناخ\nيتصف مناخ القاهره بالاعتدال معظم ايام السنه ويتراوح المعدل اليومي لدرجه الحراره خلال فصل الصيف بين 22 درجه مئويه و34 درجه مئويه في حين يتراوح المعدل اليومي خلال فصل الشتاء بين 18 درجه مئويه و9 درجه مئويه. ويمكن اعتبار ان هناك موسمين خلال العام صيف ساخن من مايو الى اكتوبر، وشتاء معتدل من نوفمبر الى ابريل، ويتميز مناخ القاهره ايضاً بانه جاف جداً، ويسقط المطر بكثافه منخفضه خلال فصل الشتاء، وترتفع مستويات الرطوبه خلال الصيف، واحياناً تتعرض القاهره لهبوب بعض الرياح الساخنه المحمله بالغبار خلال الفتره الممتده بين شهري مارس ويونيو وتعرف باسم رياح الخماسين.\n\nالسكان\nبلغ عدد سكان القاهره بنهايه عام 2018 9.7 مليون نسمه بنسبه 10.6% من اجمالي تعداد سكان مصر. لتكون بذلك اكثر مدن مصر الماهوله بالسكان، واكثرها ازدحاماً بما تحتويه من هيكل عرقي وبنيه اساسيه ووظائف محليه ودوليه متعدده، كما ينزح اليها الالاف يومياً من المحافظات بسبب عملهم داخل القاهره او انجاز المصالح الشخصيه او العلاج نتيجه لتركز الاستثمارات والاجهزه الحكوميه وكبرى المستشفيات بها.\n\nاللغه\nيتحدث سكان القاهره اللغه العربيه، الا ان العربيه المحكيه في القاهره تختلف عن تلك المحكيه في مصر الوسطى والعليا، والعربيه المصريه هي الاهم بين اشكال العربيه الحديثه المحكيه في المنطقه، ومرد ذلك اساسا ان صناعه السينما المصريه ومركزها القاهره هي الاكبر في الوطن العربي ويتم عرض الافلام المصريه في المنطقه العربيه دون ترجمه او دوبلاج. بخلاف الاخبار وما شابهها، كما ان الافلام لا تسجل باستخدام الفصحى - لغه كتابه الوطن العربي باسره - بل تستخدم اللغه المحكيه للمنطقه، وبالتالي كانت اللهجه المستخدمه هي المصريه لمعظم هذه الافلام، ولهذا السبب فان العربيه المصريه وخاصّه اللهجه القاهريه مفهومه في عموم المنطقه العربيه. العربيه الفصحى هي ومنذ السيطره العربيه على مصر في القرن السابع لغه الكتابه والادب، ولا تستخدم القبطيه الا كلغه طقسيه للكنيسه الارثوذكسيه القبطيه، والقبطيه هي استمرار للغه المصريه القديمه وتكتب بحروف مشتقه من اليونانيه وهي غير محكيه اليوم الا كلغه مقدسه. كلغات اجنبيه فان الانجليزيه والفرنسيه تستخدم كلغه نخبويه على نطاق ضيق.\n\nالدين\nالاسلام هو الدين الرسمي لمصر بما فيها مدينه القاهره وذلك طبقاً للدستور المصري، ويعترف بحقوق اتباع الديانات الثلاث اليهوديه والمسيحيه والاسلام، وغالبيه سكان المدينه من المسلمين من اهل السنه والجماعه، واكثر الاقليه من المسيحيين الارثوذكس، والاقليات الاخرى من طوائف مسيحيه بجانب اليهود. اهم المؤسسات الدينيه العامله في الدوله هي الجامع الازهر الذي يعتبر احد اهم اعمده الاسلام السني في العالم، كذلك تحتل الكنيسه القبطيه الارثوذكسيه مكانه هامه باعتبارها كنيسه وطنيه تمثل غالبيه مسيحيي مصر، اما اليهود فليس لهم مؤسسه دينيه ترعاهم لقله عددهم ولكن يرعى شئونهم طائفه خاصه بديانتهم.\n\nالثقافه\nالعماره\nتتميز القاهره كمدينه تاريخيه بتراثها العريق واحتضانها لمجموعه فريده من العمائر التي تعكس تطور العماره الاسلاميه بالمدينه على مدار الف وثلاثمائه عام واصبح الان هذا التطور البنائي متحفاً مفتوحاُ للعماره يعرض في ردهاته عمائر كل مرحله من مراحل تقدم المدينه في حلقه متصله من الاساليب المعماريه تتجلى في مبانيها كالمساجد والزوايا والمدارس والتكايا والقصور والدور والحمامات والاسبله والقناطر والوكالات والخانات والاسواق فضلاً عن قلاعها واسوارها وابوابها.\nاستلهمت العماره القاهريه المعاصره افكارها ومفرداتها من التراث المعماري المصري. ففي بدايات القرن العشرين اتجه بعض المعماريين الى استعمال العناصر الشكليه للطراز الفرعوني مثل البوابات والاعمده وقلدوها بالمواد والانشاءات الحديثه، وفي فتره التسعينيات استلهم الطراز الفرعوني في التصميم من خلال نقل مفردات المعبد الفرعوني الى واجهات المبنى، والتركيز على استخدام الشكل الهرمي كما في نصب الجندي المجهول بمدينه نصر. فيما استلهم بعض المعماريين تصميماتهم من التراث المعماري الاسلامي، وظهرت لذلك عده شواهد في النصف الاول من القرن العشرين مثل معهد الموسيقى العربيه بشارع رمسيس (1929) ومبنى جمعيه المهندسين المصريه بنفس الشارع (1935)، وفي فتره الثمانينيات والتسعينيات بدات تظهر نماذج لاعاده هذا الفكر المعماري منها مبنى مركز الدراسات التخطيطيه والمعماريه بمصر الجديده، ومبنى قاعه النيل للفنون التشكيليه بالجزيره، والمباني العاليه في ابراج مركز التجاره العالمي بكورنيش النيل، والذي يعطي دلاله واضحه على امكانيه الاستفاده من التراث الاسلامي مع معطيات العماره المعاصره والتي تركز على استخدام المباني العاليه خاصه في المدن الكبرى كاحد المحددات الاقتصاديه نظرا لارتفاع اسعار الاراضي.\n\nالاعلام\nتصدر الصحف المصريه الرئيسيه الرسميه وغير الرسميه من القاهره، ومنها مؤسسه الاهرام اعرق المؤسسات الصحفيه في مصر وتصدر عنها جريده الاهرام اليوميه والاهرام ايبدو وجريده المساء ومجله العربي ومجلات اخرى، ودار اخبار اليوم والتي يصدر عنها جريده الاخبار اليوميه واخبار اليوم الاسبوعيه والعديد من المجلات، ودار التحرير ويصدر عنها جريده الجمهوريه، ويصدر ايضا في القاهره العديد من الصحف الخاصه مثل جريده المصري اليوم وجريده الوفد والدستور وروز اليوسف وغيرها، وكذلك

الحكوميه.\n\nالفنون\nتزخر القاهره بالفنانين التشكيليين والنحاتين والمبدعين الفنيين المتواجدين بها بصفه دائمه، وتعد مركزاً للفنون بمختلف انواعها والامسيات والندوات الثقافيه والعروض المسرحيه والسينمائي، وهي واحده من المدن المبدعه المسجله في قائمه اليونسكو للمدن المبدعه في مجال الفنون والحرف منذ 2017م، وتتمثل ابرز مظاهر الفنون في القاهره في دار الاوبرا المصريه او المركز الثقافي القومي بجزيره الزمالك والذي تم تشييده كمنحه من الحكومه اليابانيه لنظيرتها المصريه وبنيت الدار على الطراز الاسلامي وتم افتتاحها في 10 اكتوبر 1988 كدار بديله لدار الاوبرا الخديويه التي بناها الخديوي اسماعيل عام 1869 واحترقت في 28 اكتوبر 1971 بعد ان ظلت مناره ثقافيه لمده 102 عام.\n\nالمطبخ\nالمطبخ القاهري هو راس المطبخ المصري البسيط المتنوع، الذي يعطى للخبز فيه الاولويه ويُطلق عليه العيش باللهجه القاهريه كمرادف للفظ الحياه، ويُعد طبقيّ الفول والطعميه من اشهر عناصر الفطور القاهري. كذلك يُعد الكشري والمسقعه والمحشي والملوخيه والفته والكوارع والارز بانواعه من ابرز الاطباق الرئيسيه. كما ان الشاي والقهوه وعصير القصب والعرقسوس والسوبيا من اكثر المشروبات شعبيه في المدينه.\n\nالاقتصاد\nالقاهره هي مركز مصر الاقتصادي، كونها عاصمه البلاد واكثر المدن المصريه الماهوله بالسكان، واقواها من حيث البنيه التحتيه، وبها تقع مقرات الشركات الكبرى، مركز التجاره العالمي، البورصه المصريه، البنك المركزي المصري، البنوك الرئيسيه، وزاره التجاره والصناعه، وزاره الاستثمار، وزاره التعاون الدولي، وهي المقر الاقليمي للمنظمه العربيه للتنميه الصناعيه والتعدين واختارتها المنظمات والمؤسسات الدوليه كمقر لمكاتبها الاقليميه في مصر مثل مؤسسه التمويل الدوليه، البنك الدولي، برنامج الامم المتحده الانمائي، منظمه العمل الدوليه، صندوق النقد الدولي، منظمه الامم المتحده للتنميه الصناعيه، منظمه الاقطار العربيه المصدره للبترول، مجلس الوحده الاقتصاديه العربيه. كما تضم عده مناطق صناعيه هي شق الثعبان على مساحه 1000 فدان، جنوب حلوان على مساحه 7

والارابيسك، وفن الزجاج المعشق بالجبس والحلي والخياميه والخزف. بجانب اسواق التحف والتذكارات والعطور الشهيره بخان الخليلي الذي يعد اشهر الخانات الاسلاميه في العالم، ويقع في القاهره الفاطميه على مشارف شارع المعز لدين الله، ويتخلله شبكه من الاسواق التقليديه وورش المقتنيات والمشغولات القضيه والنحاسيه والمذهبه والجلديه والخشبيه والورقيه. وفي عام 2009 احتلت القاهره المركز السابع ضمن ابرز 50 مدينه مؤهله لتقديم خدمات تكنولوجيا المعلومات بنظام التعهيد.\n\nالسياحه\nالقاهره مدينه سياحيه من الطراز الاول حيث تتعدد بها جميع المظاهر السياحيه التي قد يحتاج اليها اي زائر، فبها العديد من المواقع الاثريه التي تعود لعصر الفراعنه، واسوار المدينه القديمه التي ترجع الى العصر الاسلامي، والمواقع الاثريه الاسلاميه والمسيحيه واليهوديه الموجوده منذ دخول الاديان المختلفه لمصر.\nكما ينتشر بالمدينه مناطق التسوق الشهيره، والعشرات من القصور والمساجد والكنائس والبوابات التاريخيه والمباني العريقه من مختلف العصور بالاضافه للاماكن الثقافيه والفنيه والمسارح وغيرها، وينتشر بها اعداد كبيره من الفنادق واماكن الاقامه بمختلف انواعها ودرجاتها.\nوتزخر كذلك بالمحميات الطبيعيه البعيده عن زحام قلب المدينه، والتي تبرز كمزارات باعثه على الهدوء والراحه والتامل في الطبيعيه. بخلاف التمتع برحلات نهر النيل الذي بني على ضفتيه دره ما تملكه المدينه من منشات معماريه حديثه.\n\nالسياحه الترفيهيه\nالقاهره موقع لعده مزارات سياحيه ترفيهيه هامه تضم حدائق ترفيهيه على مساحات شاسعه يقبل عليها الكبار والصغار على حد سواء ومنها حديقه الازبكيه، الحديقه الدوليه، حديقه الفسطاط،  والحديقه اليابانيه بحلوان والتي تحتوي على بعض التماثيل التي ترمز لحقب تاريخيه مختلفه، مثل تمثال زهره اللوتس، تماثيل افيال الشرق التي تحرس المكان، تمثال وجه الحياه وهو لامراه تغمض عينيها مع ابتسامه خجل تعكس فكره تقديس الشرق للمراه، و48 تمثالاً لتلاميذ «شيبه» يجلس ليعلمهم الديانه البوذيه امام البحيره الكبيره، تمثال الحكمه الثلاثيه وهو لثلاثه قرود تحث الانسان على عدم التدخل في شؤون الغير «لا اسمع لا ارى لا اتكلم»، بالاضافه الى بحيره اللوتس وكشك الموسيقى والاشجار. وياتي على راس متنزهات القاهره حديقه الازهر التي تعد احد اضخم حدائق القاهره وواحده من اكبر واجمل حدائق العالم. تقع على مساحه 80 فدان كانت تستغل في الماضي كمقلب للقمامه والمخلفات لمده تزيد على الف عام. تم الاعلان عن المشروع في عام 1984 وافتتحت للزائرين في عام 2005 حيث استغرق انشاؤها اكثر من 7 اعوام بتكلفه اجماليه تزيد على 100 مليون جنيه تحملتها مؤسسه اغاخان للعماره الاسلاميه.\nكما يبرز برج القاهره كاحد معالم المدينه الحديثه والذي صممه المهندس نعوم شبيب، وتم بناؤه على شكل زهره اللوتس المصريه من الخرسانه المسلحه خلال الفتره من 1956 وحتى 1961. يقف البرج على قاعده من احجار الجرانيت الاسواني التي سبق ان استخدمها المصريون القدماء في بناء معابدهم ومقابرهم، ويصل ارتفاعه الى 187 متر وهو اعلى من الهرم الاكبر بالجيزه بحوالي 43 متر، ويتكون من 16 طابقاً، وتستغرق رحله الوصول الى قمه البرج 45 ثانيه داخل المصعد للوصول الى نهايته. يقع البرج في قلب القاهره على جزيره الزمالك بنهر

التجريبي، مهرجان القاهره للاعلام العربي، مهرجان عيد وفاء النيل.\n\nسياحه زياره المقابر\nتقع في مصر 16 مقبره لمقابر الكومنولث منتشره بمحافظات القاهره، الاسكندريه، مطروح، بورسعيد، الاسماعيليه، السويس، اسوان. وتشرف عليها هيئه الكومنولث وهي منظمه تشرف على 23 الف موقع منتشره في 154 دوله لرفات ضحايا الحروب العالميه.\nتحظى المقابر باهتمام الالاف من احفاد ضحايا الحربين العالميه الاولى والثانيه بالعالم ممن يهتمون بزيارتها تخليداً لذكرى اجدادهم. ياتي نصيب القاهره في مقبرتين تقع الاولى بالقرب من شارع صلاح سالم وصممها السير روبرت لوريمر، والثانيه في هليوبوليس وصممها هربرت ورثينجتون.\n\nمواقع التراث العالمي\nتعد القاهره القديمه احدى اقدم مدن العالم الاسلاميّه بما تضمه من جوامع ومدارس وحمامات وينابيع. تاسست المدينه في القرن العاشر واصبحت مركزاً للعالم الاسلامي ووصلت لعصرها الذهبي في القرن الرابع عشر. وقررت لجنه اليونسكو ادراجها ضمن قائمه التراث العالمي في عام 1979. تضم القاهره التاريخيه انواعاً من العمائر رفيعه الطراز مثل المدارس والوكالات والخنقاوات والاسبله والحمامات والبيوت والقصور الاثريه مثل بيت السحيمي وقصر الامير بشتاك، والاسواق مثل خان الخليلي والصاغه والنحاسين، والاحياء العتيقه مثل التربيعه والخياميه وتحت الربع، ويحيط بها اسوار وبوابات مثل باب النصر وباب الفتوح والتي كانت تغلق قديماً في المساء لحفظ الامن والنظام.\nكما تحتضن المدينه عدداً ضخماً من المساجد القديمه منها جامع عمرو بن العاص الذي يعد اول بناء اقيم في الفسطاط، وجامع ابن طولون الذي يعتبر ثالث مسجد انشئ في مصر بعد جامع عمرو بن العاص وجامع العسكر وبدا بناءه عام 876 واتم تشييده في عام 879، فيما يعد الجامع الازهر اول عمل معماري فاطمي عاصر تاسيس القاهره وظل باقياً حتى اليوم وانشاه جوهر الصقلي قائد المعز لدين الله فبدا العمل في بنائه عام 970 وانتهى من تاسيسه عام 972، وفي عهد الخليفه الظافر بامر الله شيد مسجد الحسين عام 1154.\n\nالبنيه التحتيه\nالتعليم\nكانت القاهره منذ فتره طويله محور التعليم والخدمات التعليميه ليس فقط لمصر ولكن ايضاً للعالم الاسلامي قاطباً. وبالقاهره العدد الاكبر من المدارس والجامعات والمعاهد بين مدن مصر، ومرجع ذلك هو عدد سكانها الضخم. ولا يختلف التعليم في القاهره عن التعليم في باقي انحاء مصر، فهو تقريباً بنفس الجوده. يوجد بجانب المدارس الحكوميه العديد من المدارس الخاصه التي تدرس مناهج مشابهه للمناهج في المدارس الحكوميه ولكنها اقل في اعداد الطلاب واكثر كفاءه من المدارس الحكوميه الرسميه نظراً للدعم المالي المتوفر، وهناك مدارس اللغات التي تدرس نفس المناهج باللغات الانجليزيه او الفرنسيه او الالمانيه وهي تسير على النظام التعليمي المتبع في هذه الدول، وهناك المدارس الدينيه وعلى راسها المدارس الازهريه التي تتميز بذاتيتها في المناهج والزياده في بعض المواد الدينيه. وتعتبر القاهره هي مهد تاسيس جامعه القاهره كاول جامعه على النظم الحديثه، حيث تم انشاؤها تحت اسم (الجامعه المصريه) في قصر جناكليس (بشارع القصر العيني) عام 1907 قبل ان يتم نقل الجامعه الى مقرها الحالي بالجيزه، وتضم المدينه حالياً عده جامعات متنوعه ما بين عريقه وحديثه النشاه منها جامعه حلوان، جامعه عين شمس، جامعه الازهر، الجامعه الامريكيه، الجامعه الالمانيه، الجامعه الفرنسيه، الجامعه البريطانيه، الجامعه الروسيه، اكاديميه الشرطه، فرع الاكاديميه العربيه للعلوم.\n\nالصحه\nالقاهره موقع لمئات المستشفيات العامه والخاصه، ومن اشهر مستشفياتها الحديثه: عين شمس التخصصي، السلام الدولي، النزهه الدولي، دار الشفاء، دار الحكمه، كليوباترا، مستشفى العباسيه للصحه النفسيه، مستشفى الامراض الصدريه بالعباسيه، مستشفى 57357 لعلاج سرطان الاطفال بالمجان، المعهد القومي للكلى والمسالك البوليه، ويضم شارع القصر العيني التاريخي عده صروح صحيه هي المعهد القومي للاورام، المعهد القومي لابحاث الامراض المتوطنه والكبد، المعهد القومي للتغذيه، مستشفى قصر العيني. واختيرت المدينه ايضاً كمقر لاكبر مستشفيات اداره الخدمات الطبيه للقوات المسلحه المصريه ومنها المجمع الطبي للقوات المسلحه بكوبري القبه، المجمع الطبي للقوات المسلحه بالمعادي، مستشفى غمره العسكري، مستشفى الماظه العسكري، مستشفى الحلميه العسكري للعظام والتكميل، مستشفى العاملين المدنيين بالقوات المسلحه، مستشفى الجلاء لعائلات ضباط القوات المسلحه.\n\nالرياضه\nيوجد بالقاهره العدد الاكبر من الانديه الرياضيه الموجوده في مصر واكثرها شعبيه، بالاضافه لاكبر عدد من الملاعب والصالات الرياضيه لمختلف الالعاب. وقامت القاهره بتنظيم العديد من البطولات والدورات الرياضيه الافريقيه والشرق اوسطيه والاسلاميه والبحر متوسطيه والعالميه ومن ابرزها كاس الامم الافريقيه لكره القدم 1986، دوره الالعاب الافريقيه 1991، بطوله العالم لكره اليد للرجال 1999، بطوله العالم للاسكواش للرجال 2006، كاس الامم

هليوبوليس، نادي الشمس، نادي السكه الحديد، نادي المقاولون العرب، نادي النصر، وادي دجله. ومن اهم الصروح الرياضيه في القاهره ستاد القاهره الدولي الذي تاسس في عام 1955 واكتمل بناؤه عام 1960 وافتتحه الرئيس جمال عبد الناصر في احتفالات ثوره يوليو في نفس العام، وسمي باستاد ناصر، الى ان غير الاسم الرئيس محمد حسني مبارك ويعد من اكبر الصروح الرياضيه في الشرق الاوسط وافريقيا وبه مجمع لالعاب الصالات الصالات، وفي عام 2015 احتل المركز الـ 26 في قائمه افضل ملاعب العالم بناءً على عده معايير ابرزها السعه الجماهيريه وتاريخ الانشاء والهندسه المعماريه، وذلك بجانب ملاعب كره القدم الشهيره مثل ملعب الكليه الحربيه، ملعب 30 يونيو «ستاد الدفاع الجوي».\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nيصل محاور واحياء ومناطق القاهره ويربطها بباقي مدن ومحافظات مصر شبكه طرق ومواصلات ضخمه، يدار اغلبها باستخدام اشارات المرور الالكترونيه وتراقب بكاميرات المراقبه، وتخدم يومياً ملايين المواطنين. تضم تلك الشبكه عده كباري وجسور بالاضافه الى خطوط السكك الحديديه وقطارات الانفاق جنباً الى جنب الحافلات العامه وسيارات الاجره. ويربط المدينه بباقي مدن العالم ميناء القاهره الجوي الذي يعد المطار الاهم والاكبر في مصر.\n\nميناء القاهره الجوي\nميناء القاهره الجوي او مطار القاهره الدولي هو مطار دولي يقع على مسافه 22 كم شمال شرق مدينه القاهره، وتبلغ مساحته حوالي 40 مليون متر مربع. يعود تاريخ انشاء المطار الى عام 1942 وافتتح بشكله الحديث في عام 1963، ويعتبر البوابه الجويه الرئيسيه لمصر، فيما يعد ثاني اكبر مطار في قاره افريقيا من حيث الحركه الجويه بعد مطار كيب تاون بجنوب افريقيا. يمثل المطار حوالي 40% من الحركه الجويه بمصر ويرتبط بـ 91 مطار في مختلف انحاء العالم من خلال خطوط الطيران المختلفه. تبلغ الطاقه الاستيعابيه للمطار حالياً 22 مليون راكب سنوياً، ويستخدمه اكثر من 60 شركه طيران من مختلف دول العالم، وعشره شركات للشحن الجوي، بالاضافه لرحلات الطيران العارض ويقوم على ادارته وتشغيله شركه ميناء القاهره الجوي. اختير المطار كافضل مطارات افريقيا لعام 2006 من قبل اتحاد شركات الطيران الافريقيه وذلك من خلال استقصاء اجراه الاتحاد عن تطوير المطارات الافريقيه من حيث الاداء والبنيه التحتيه والتحديث المستمر. ازدادت اهميه المطار خاصه بعد انضمام شركه مصر للطيران الى تحالف ستار وتحول مطار القاهره الى مطار محوري يربط بين افريقيا والشرق الاوسط واوروبا، وذلك لتجميع ركاب الترانزيت والانطلاق بهم الى جميع مطارات العالم. يضم المطار ثلاثه مباني للركاب مبنى رقم (1) سعته 6 ملايين راكب/سنوياً، ومبنى رقم (2) سعته 3.5 مليون راكب/سنوياً، ومبنى رقم (3) سعته 11 مليون راكب/سنوياً، بالاضافه الى مبنى الرحلات الموسميه وسعته مليوني راكب/سنوياً، كما يضم اربعه مدارج لاقلاع وهبوط الطائرات.\n\nالنقل النهري\nبدا استخدام الاوتوبيس النهري عام 1961 كوسيله مواصلات ولاغراض الرحلات النيليه القصيره، وفي 1 مارس 2016 تم افتتاح مشروع التاكسي النهري من القاهره الى المعادي، على ان يبدا خط سير التاكسي النهري من مرسى نادي اليخت بكورنيش المعادي مروراً بثلاث محطات هي منيل الروضه، جاردن سيتي، وصولاً الى التحرير كمرحله اولى، بحيث يتم مد المشروع ليغطي باقي مناطق القاهره الكبرى. يعمل التاكسي النهري حالياً بشكل تجريبي لاغراض نقل الركاب والسياحه والرحلات وذلك للحين الانتهاء من اجراءات ترخيص المراسي من محافظتي القاهره والجيزه. وترتبط القاهره بباقي محافظات مصر بعده خطوط ملاحيه نهريه تتمثل في خط القاهره/اسوان، خط القاهره/الاسكندريه، خط القاهره/دمياط. تتمثل اهميه النقل النهري من منطلق انه اكثر وسائل الانتقال اماناً لقله الحوادث مقارنه بوسائل النقل الاخرى نظراً لانسيابيه الحركه، ولعدم وجود تقاطعات مروريه كما انه صديق للبيئه وكذلك يتمتع بمعدل استهلاك وقود منخفض والقدره على نقل الشحنات ذات الاحجام الكبيره والتي لا يمثل عنصر الوقت والسرعه اهميه كبيره في نقلها.\n\nالسكك الحديديه\nتعتبر محطه سكك حديد القاهره «محطه مصر او محطه رمسيس او محطه باب الحديد» من اقدم محطات السكك الحديديه الموجوده في العالم حيث تعد سكك حديد مصر هي اول خطوط سكك حديد يتم انشاؤها في افريقيا والشرق الاوسط والثانيه على مستوى العالم بعد المملكه المتحده حيث بدا انشاؤها في خمسينيات القرن التاسع عشر، وبدا تشغيلها في عهد الخديوي اسماعيل، ويقوم على تشغيل المحطه الهيئه القوميه لسكك حديد مصر التي تعرف اختصاراً باسم (س.ح.م) وهي شركه تمتلكها الحكومه المصريه بالكامل. خضعت المحطه الى عمليه تطوير شامله على مرحلتين تضمنت ترميم واجهه المحطه الرئيسيه التاريخيه، وتجديد صاله كبار الزوار ومكتب شرطه السياحه ومكتب ناظر المحطه، بالاضافه للارصفه الرئيسيه الاربعه والساحه الخارجيه للمحطه، وتم فتح عدد من المحلات التجاريه ومكاتب لبعض البنوك ومول تجاري يضم انشطه تجاريه وخدميه وترفيهيه ومقاهي بهدف زياده عائدات المحطه السنويه، بالاضافه الى اعاده تصميم البهو الرئيسي وتطوير صاله التذاكر لتصبح صاله الكترونيه، وزياده القدره الكهربائيه للمحطه، وتم تزويد المحطه بماكينات لصرف تذاكر القطارات من خلال بطاقات الدفع مقدماً، مع امكانيه الحجز عن طريق الكمبيوتر وبطاقات الصرف الالي، مما ادي الى تقليل الزحام على شباك التذاكر. وتم اضافه نصب تذكاري في البهو الرئيسي للمحطه على هيئه هرم نصفه الاعلى مفرغ لرؤيه هرم داخلي واخر بلوري يضم قائمه باسماء شهداء ثوره 25 يناير، وزودت المحطه ببوابات امنيه الكترونيه وشبكه مراقبه بالكاميرات. وصلت تكلفه تطوير المحطه الى 160 مليون جنيه، وقام باعداد المخطط العام والتصميمات والرسومات الهندسيه للمشروع المركز الهندسي للخدمه العامه بكليه الهندسه بجامعه الاسكندريه.\n\nالترام\nيعود تاريخ ترام القاهره او ترام مصر الجديده الى ثمانينات القرن الماضي، حينما قرر البارون امبان المهندس البلجيكي انشاء مصر الجديده، وكانت فكرته حينها بتدشين ترام يجوب الشوارع الفارغه ليجذب اليها المواطنين، وتولت شركه مصر الجديده للانشاء والتعمير مسئوليه تعمير المدينه الجديده وتوفير البنيه التحتيه من كهرباء ومياه وكذلك اداره الترام. كان الترام يمر بـ 16 محطه وشهد انكماشاً في عدد المحطات حتى وصلت حالياً الى 8 محطات فقط متمثله في 3 خطوط. يعد الترام وسيله مواصلات سهله واقتصاديه، ما يجعله الخيار الانسب لمحدودي الدخل. وبين الحين والاخر تنتشر اخبار عن الغاؤه بهدف توسيع الطرق التي يمر بها لتقليل معدل التكدسات المروريه، فيما تنفي المصادر الحكوميه تلك الاخبار وتصرح بنيتها لتطويره وتحديث العربات لتقديم خدمه افضل للمواطنين.\n\nقطارات الانفاق\nتحتل القاهره المركز السابع عالمياً بين اكثر مدن العالم ازدحاماً مما دعا الحكومه المصريه لاتخاذ اجراءات موازيه لتحسين شبكه المواصلات لكي تتماشى مع الزياده السكانيه بالمدينه وتستطيع ان تغطي متطلباتها، فبدا التفكير في مشروع مترو الانفاق كاحد حلول الازمه المروريه بالعاصمه المصريه. بدء تنفيذ المرحله الاولى من الخط الاول عام 1982، وانتهت في 1 اكتوبر 1987 والمرحله الثانيه في 12 ابريل 1989 ليربط المنطقه الصناعيه وجامعه حلوان بالمنطقه التجاريه بوسط القاهره ومنطقه شمال شرق القاهره، حيث وصل حتى المرج بطول 42.7 كم، ويرتبط الخط تبادلياً بخطوط السكك الحديديه الرئيسيه للوجه القبلي والبحري عند محطه الشهداء (مبارك سابقاً) وبخط السويس / اسماعيليه عند محطه عين شمس وبخط المرج / شبين القناطر / قليوب عند محطه المرج، ويبلغ عدد محطات الخط 34 محطه منهم 5 محطات نفقيه، وبقيه المحطات سطحيه. وبسبب الزياده للسكانيه ومشاكل النقل العام بدات الحكومه المصريه التفكير في دعم مترو الانفاق بانشاء خط ثاني يربط القاهره بمحافظتي الجيزه والقليوبيه ويربط محطه سكك حديد شبرا الخيمه مع محطه سكك حديد الجيزه. فانشئ الخط الثاني من محطه شبرا الخيمه الى الجيزه مروراً بمحطه الشهداء «رمسيس» ومحطه السادات «التحرير» التبادليه ايضاً. وتلبيه لمطالب النقل الكثيفه تم تنفيذ المرحله الاولى والثانيه والثالثه من الخط الثالث لمترو الانفاق ليربط شرق القاهره بغربها، مع تبادل الخدمه مع القطار الكهربائي الخفيف LRT في محطه عدلي منصور المركزيه، ومع الخط الاول في محطه جمال عبد الناصر ومع الخط الثاني في محطه العتبه، وذلك بهدف خفض المرور السطحي لوسائل النقل الاخرى بما يعادل مليوني رحله/يومياً، ووفر زمن الرحلات خلال العام بقدر 564 مليون ساعه لجميع وسائل النقل.\n\nسيارات الاجره\nاشتهرت سيارات الاجره بالقاهره باللونين الابيض والاسود. ثم انشئ جهاز تاكسي العاصمه لادخال سيارات حديثه الى شوارع القاهره تعمل الى جانب التاكسي القديم وتستخدم تعريفه ركوب محدده، وتميزت تلك السيارات باللون الاصفر. وذلك حتى بدات محافظه القاهره مشروع احلال وتبديل سيارات التاكسي القديم باخري حديثه تتميز باللون «الابيض» عن طريق جهاز تاكسي العاصمه، وبالتعاون بين محافظه القاهره ووزارتي البيئه والماليه وعدد من الجهات التنفيذيه. ويعتبر تاكسي لندن «الاسود» الذي ظهر في القاهره عام 2010 من افضل سيارات الاجره بالمدينه، رغم ارتفاع اسعاره نسبياً، الا انه موجه في الاساس لخدمه السائحين ورجال الاعمال. وبسبب تطور الخدمات التقنيه وانحدار خدمه التاكسي «الابيض»، ظهرت في اواخر عام 2015 شركات تستخدم السيارات الخاصه في الاغراض التجاريه لنقل الافراد باجر، وذلك باستخدام تطبيقات الاجهزه الذكيه.\n\nحافلات النقل العام\nيقوم على تشغيل حافلات نقل الافراد بالقاهره هيئه النقل العام التابعه لمحافظه القاهره والتي قامت منذ عام 2010 بالبدء في تحديث اسطولها من الحافلات وقامت بطرح اوتوبيسات جديده اختير لها اللون الاحمر، وسحب الاوتوبيسات القديمه ذات اللون الاخضر والاخرى ذات اللون الابيض. كما قامت بادخال اوتوبيسات اخرى جديده للخدمه في عام 2016، اختير لها اللون الازرق. وفي عام 2015 تسلمت القاهره 600 حافله نقل عام مقدمه كمنحه من دوله الامارات لتطوير اسطول هيئه النقل العام بالقاهره بقيمه اجماليه 550 مليون جنيه، والتي روعي في تصنيعها التمتع بمواصفات الخدمه الشاقه وان يتم تصنيعها بنسبه 50% في مصر والنصف الاخر في مصنع للحافلات بابوظبي بالامارات.\n\nالطرق البريه\nيربط مناطق القاهره عده محاور مروريه اشهرها الطريق الدائري وهو طريق محيطي انشئ بهدف ربط محافظات القاهره الكبرى، وتخفيف زحام السيارات داخل القاهره وضواحيها حيث تصل الحركه المروريه عليه الى اكثر من 100 الف سياره/يوم. بدات وزاره الاسكان في انشاء الطريق عام 1986 وتم الانتهاء منه بالكامل عام 2005 بطول اجمالي 100 كم. وكوبري اكتوبر الذي يتراوح عرضه بين 14 الى 34 متر ويشمل 23 مطلع ومنزل بعرض 7 الى 8 متر، يبدا الكوبري من الدقي ويعبر نهر النيل ويمر بمنطقه غمره حتى يصل الى طريق النصر. وشارع صلاح سالم الذي يعد من اكبر واطول شوارع القاهره، حيث تصب فيه روافد من جميع انحاء المدينه مما يجعله محوراً رئيسياً. وطريق النصر وشارع جسر السويس. ومن اشهر ميادين القاهره الخديويه ميدان التحرير، ميدان رمسيس، ميدان العتبه، ميدان التوفيقيه، ميدان طلعت حرب، ميدان عابدين، ميدان الفلكي، ميدان لاظوغلي، ميدان باب اللوق، ميدان مصطفي كامل، ميدان محمد فريد، ميدان الاوبرا. ومن ميادين القاهره القديمه ميدان السيده زينب، ميدان السيده عائشه، ميدان السيده نفيسه. ومن ميادين منطقه مصر الجديده والقبه ميدان العباسيه، ميدان حدائق القبه، ميدان روكسي، ميدان تريومف، ميدان المحكمه، ميدان الجامع، ميدان الكوربه، ميدان هليوبوليس. ومن ميادين مدينه نصر ميدان الساعه، ميدان رابعه العدويه.\n\nالمسافه بين القاهره والمدن المصريه\nفيما يلي جدول المسافه بالكيلومتر بين مدينه القاهره وبعض المدن المصريه:\n\nمشاكل المدينه\nالعشوائيات\nتعد مشكله العشوائيات من مشكلات المدينه المعاصره التي نمت اوضاعها مع الزياده السكانيه التي شهدتها المدينه منذ الستينات، وما صاحب ذلك من تغيرات اجتماعيه واقتصاديه ادت الى استمرار تزايد معدلات الهجره من الريف الى القاهره مما اسفر عن معدلات طلب متزايده بسوق العقارات يقابلها نقص في عدد الوحدات السكنيه المطروحه، فظهرت على السطح مشكله المناطق العشوائيه التي تنوعت ما بين مساكن الايواء المؤقت، ومساكن وضع اليد المشيده على اراضي مغتصبه، والمساكن المشيده بتقاسيم غير معتمده او بدون تراخيص قانونيه. ونتيجه لتفشي تلك الظاهره بالقاهره وعده مدن مصريه اخرى، بدات الحكومه المصريه في التعامل معها عن طريق عده محاور منها التطوير من خلال موازنه الدوله، التطوير من خلال التعاون مع جهات دوليه، التطوير من خلال التعاون مع الجمعيات الاهليه ورجال الاعمال والمجتمع المدني، التطوير من خلال التعاون مع الوزارات ذات الصله باماكن التطوير.\n\nالتلوث\nتتعدى نسبه تلوث هواء القاهره بالاتربه المؤشرات الدوليه بـ 7 مرات، وصنفها المؤتمر السنوي الـ 11 للجمعيه المصريه للشعب الهوائيه والصدر والحساسيه القاهره كثالث اكثر مدن العالم في معدل تلوث الهواء بعد مدينتي «نيومكسيكو» المكسيكيه، والعاصمه الصينيه «بكين». ويعود ارتفاع نسبه التلوث بالقاهره الى عده اسباب منها الدخان الناتج عن حرق قش الارز في بعض محافظات الدلتا وشمال الصعيد القريبه من القاهره، مما يشكل ما يعرف منذ سنوات بظاهره «السحابه السوداء»، كما تضخ المصانع بالقاهره والمحافظات القريبه منها (الجيزه والقليوبيه) والتي تصل الى حوالي 12600 منشاه صناعيه كميات كبيره من الملوثات والادخنه، فيما تضخ حرائق القمامه في الاماكن المكشوفه داخل القاهره وفي المحافظات القريبه منها بالاضافه الى عوادم وسائل النقل والمواصلات اطنان من الادخنه الملوثه. وتقدر الخسائر الماديه المترتبه على تلوث الهواء والجو في القاهره بحوالي 10 مليارات جنيه سنوياً.\n\nالزحام\nاصبحت مشكله التكدس المروري والزحام بالقاهره احد ازمات المدينه اليوميه، وخصوصاً خلال ساعات الذروه. وكشفت دراسه حديثه عن ازمه المرور بالقاهره صادره عن البنك الدولي بالاشتراك مع المعهد القومي للنقل التابع لوزاره النقل ان الزحام المروري في القاهره يتسبب في خسائر سنويه للدوله تقدر بحوالي 50 مليار جنيه، بما يعادل %4 من اجمالي الناتج المحلي السنوي للدوله، تشمل تكاليف الوقود والاثار الصحيه الناتجه من سوء نوعيه الهواء والحوادث، بجانب التاخير في الانتقال والوصول. واضافت الدراسه ان متوسط السرعه على الطرق الرئيسيه في القاهره تتراوح بين 15 و40 كم في الساعه. وتعود تلك المشكله الى عده عوامل اهمها الزياده السكانيه غير المخطط لها، وبالتالي لم تتمكن الشوارع العامه من استيعاب تلك الاعداد وتحقيق سيوله مروريه مقبوله، اهمال صيانه الطرق الرئيسيه وتوسيعها ودعمها بانظمه مروريه حديثه وتخطيط اماكن للانتظار، عدم وجود حارات خاصه لحافلات النقل العام ومقطورات النقل الثقيل، عدم تطبيق قواعد المرور بحزم، ضعف سلوكيات القياده، انتشار الباعه الجائلين بالميادين والشوارع، ظاهره المواقف العشوائيه، قله ساحات انتظار السيارات سواء السطحيه او متعدده الطوابق.\n\nاعلام المدينه\nمحمد رفعت، رائد قراء القران الكريم في مصر، من مواليد 9 مايو 1882 بحي المغربلين.\nطلعت حرب، رائد الاقتصاد
