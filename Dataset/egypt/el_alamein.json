Located on the Mediterranean Sea, it lies 106 kilometres (66 mi) west of Alexandria and 300 kilometres (186 mi) northwest of Cairo. The town is located on the site of the ancient city Antiphrai (Greek: Ἀντίφραι). The city is divided into three main areas: El Alamein, Sidi Abdel Rahman, and Tel El Eis village.\nThe city's economy is mainly based on its natural resources of petroleum, which is explored by several Egyptian companies, and the tourist areas where a number of luxury hotels and tourist resorts are located, such as the tourist town of Marina.\n\nTourism\nMilitary cemeteries\nGermany\nThere are Italian and German military cemeteries on Tel el-Eisa Hill outside the town. The German cemetery is an ossuary, built in the style of a medieval fortress.\n\nItaly\nThe cemetery of the Italian War Memorial at El Alamein contains 5,200 graves.\n\nGreek\nThere is a Greek cemetery at El Alamein.\n\nCommonwealth of Nations\nThe Commonwealth Alamein Memorial and attached war cemetery, built and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, has  graves of soldiers from various countries who fought on the Allied side.

However, like the rest of the northern coast of Egypt, its climate is slightly less hot, compared to the rest of Egypt, because of the prevailing Mediterranean Sea winds.\n\nWorld War II\nTwo important World War II battles were fought in the area:\n\nAt the First Battle of El Alamein (1–27 July 1942), the advance of Axis troops on Alexandria was blunted by the Allies, stopping the Italian and German forces that were trying to outflank the Allies' position.\nAt the Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October – 4 November 1942), Allied forces broke the Axis line and forced them all the way back to Tunisia. Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister at the time, said of this victory: \"Now this is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\" After the war, he wrote: \"Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein, we never had a defeat.\"\n\nGallery\nSee also\nEl Alamein Fountain (war memorial commemorating the battle, in Sydney, Australia)\nEl Alamein International Airport\nEnham Alamein (village in Hampshire in England, renamed after the battle)\nMarina El Alamein (tourist resort)\nNew Alamein\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to El Alamein at Wikimedia Commons\n\nFalling Rain Genomics, Inc. \"Geographical information on Al 'Alamayn, Egypt\".
