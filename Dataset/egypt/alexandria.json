      "content": "Alexandria is a major city in Egypt. Lying at the western edge of the Nile River Delta, it extends about 40 km (25 mi) along the country's northern coast. It is Egypt's principal seaport, the second largest city after Cairo, and the largest city on the Mediterranean coast. Founded in 331 BC by Alexander the Great, Alexandria is one of the largest and most important cities of antiquity and a leading hub for science, culture, and scholarship. \nNicknamed the \"Bride of the Mediterranean\" and \"Pearl of the Mediterranean Coast\", the city is a popular tourist destination and a major industrial centre. It is the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and in the Middle East, and the eleventh-largest city and urban area in Africa. Alexandria was established originally near an ancient Egyptian settlement named Rhacotis, which later became its Egyptian quarter. The city was made the capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and became the foremost commercial, intellectual, and cultural centre for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity; at one time, it was the most populous city in the ancient world. Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library, the largest in the ancient world; and the Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages.\nAlexandria retained its status as one of the leading cities of the Mediterranean world for almost a millennium, through the period of Roman and Byzantine rule until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, when a new capital was founded at Fustat, now part of Cairo. The city was a major hub of early Christianity and hosted the Patriarchate of Alexandria, one of the leading Christian centres in the Eastern Roman Empire; the modern Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.  \nBy the mid seventh century, Alexandria had already been largely plundered and lost its significance, although it persisted as a trading hub and naval base. From the late 18th century, it was a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world, owing to the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean and Red Seas and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton. Alexandria’s rebirth began in the early 19th century under Muhammad Ali, considered the founder of modern Egypt, who implemented infrastructure projects and modernisation efforts.\n\nName\nAlexandria was located on the earlier Egyptian settlement, which was called Rhacotis (Ancient Greek: Ῥακῶτις, romanized: Rhakôtis), the Hellenised form of Egyptian r-ꜥ-qd(y)t. As one of many settlements founded by Alexander the Great, the city he founded on Rhacotis was called Alexándreia hḗ kat' Aígypton (Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ κατ' Αἴγυπτον), which some sources translated as \"Alexandria by Egypt\", as the city was, at that time, in the periphery of Egypt proper (the area beside the Nile). Some of the Alexandrian and Greek populaces, e.g., Hypsicles, also referred to the city as Alexándreia hḗ prós Aígypton (Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ πρός Αἴγυπτον, \"Alexandria near Egypt\"). In the course of Roman rule in Egypt, the city's name was Latinised as Alexandrēa ad Aegyptum.\nAfter the capture of Alexandria by the Rashiduns in AD 641, the name was Arabicised: initial Al- was re-analysed into the definite article; metathesis occurred on x, from [ks] to [sk]; and the suffix -eia was assimilated into the feminine adjectival suffix -iyya (ـِيَّة), finally rendering the name al-ʔiskandariyya (الْإِسْكَنْدَرِيَّة).\n\nHistory\nAncient era\nRadiocarbon dating of seashell fragments and lead contamination show human activity at the location during the period of the Old Kingdom (27th–21st centuries BC) and again in the period 1000–800 BC, followed by the absence of activity after that. From ancient sources it is known there existed a trading post at this location during the time of Rameses the Great for trade with Crete, but it had long been lost by the time of Alexander's arrival. A small Egyptian fishing village named Rhakotis (Egyptian: rꜥ-qdy.t, 'That which is built up') existed since the 13th century BC in the vicinity and eventually grew into the Egyptian quarter of the city. Just east of Alexandria (where Abu Qir Bay is now), there were in ancient times marshland and several islands. As early as the 7th century BC, there existed important port cities of Canopus and Heracleion. The latter was recently rediscovered underwater.\n\nAlexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in April 331 BC as Ἀλεξάνδρεια (Alexandreia), as one of his many city foundations. After he captured the Egyptian Satrapy from the Persians, Alexander wanted to build a large Greek city on Egypt's coast that would bear his name. He chose the site of Alexandria, envisioning the building of a causeway to the nearby island of Pharos that would generate two great natural harbours. Alexandria was intended to supersede the older Greek colony of Naucratis as a Hellenistic center in Egypt and to be the link between Greece and the rich Nile valley. A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to the city during his life.\nAfter Alexander's departure, his viceroy Cleomenes continued the expansion. The architect Dinocrates of Rhodes designed the city, using a Hippodamian grid plan. Following Alexander's death in 323 BC, his general Ptolemy Lagides took possession of Egypt and brought Alexander's body to Egypt with him. Ptolemy at first ruled from the old Egyptian capital of Memphis. In 322/321 BC he had Cleomenes executed. Finally, in 305 BC, Ptolemy declared himself Pharaoh as Ptolemy I Soter (\"Savior\") and moved his capital to Alexandria.\nAlthough Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandria's early development, the Heptastadion and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined Tyre and becoming the centre of the new commerce between Europe and the Arabian and Indian East, the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than Carthage. In one century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became Egypt's main Greek city, with Greek people from diverse backgrounds.\nThe Septuagint, a Greek version of the Tanakh, was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept the city in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic centre of learning (Library of Alexandria, which faced destruction during Caesar's siege of Alexandria in 47 BC), but were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, Egyptian and Jewish. By the time of Augustus, the city grid encompassed an area of 10 km2 (3.9 sq mi), and the total population during the Roman principate was around 500,000–600,000, which would wax and wane in the course of the next four centuries under Roman rule.\nAccording to Philo of Alexandria, in the year 38 AD, disturbances erupted between Jews and Greek citizens of Alexandria during a visit paid by King Agrippa I to Alexandria, principally over the respect paid by the Herodian nation to the Roman emperor, which quickly escalated to open affronts and violence between the two ethnic groups and the desecration of Alexandrian synagogues. This event has been called the Alexandrian pogroms. The violence was quelled after Caligula intervened and had the Roman governor, Flaccus, removed from the city.\n\nIn 115 AD, large parts of Alexandria were destroyed during the Diaspora revolt, which gave Hadrian and his architect, Decriannus, an opportunity to rebuild it. In 215 AD, the emperor Caracalla visited the city and, because of some insulting satires that the inhabitants had directed at him, abruptly commanded his troops to put to death all youths capable of bearing arms. On 21 July 365 AD, Alexandria was devastated by a tsunami (365 Crete earthquake), an event annually commemorated years later as a \"day of horror\".\n\nIslamic era\nIn 619, Alexandria fell to the Sassanid Persians. The city was mostly uninjured by the conquest and a new palace called Tarawus was erected in the eastern part of the city, later known as Qasr Faris, \"fort of the Persians\". Although the Byzantine emperor Heraclius recovered it in 629, in 641 the Arabs under the general 'Amr ibn al-'As invaded it during the Muslim conquest of Egypt, after a siege that lasted 14 months. The first Arab governor of Egypt recorded to have visited Alexandria was Utba ibn Abi Sufyan, who strengthened the Arab presence and built a governor's palace in the city in 664–665.\nIn reference to Alexandria, Ibn Battuta speaks of a number of Muslim saints that resided in the city. One such saint was Imam Borhan Oddin El Aaraj, who was said to perform miracles. Another notable figure was Yaqut al-'Arshi, a disciple of Abu Abbas El Mursi. Ibn Battuta also writes about Abu 'Abdallah al-Murshidi, a saint that lived in the Minyat of Ibn Murshed. Although al-Murshidi lived in seclusion, Ibn Battuta writes that he was regularly visited by crowds, high state officials, and even by the Sultan of Egypt at the time, al-Nasir Muhammad. Ibn Battuta also visited the Pharos lighthouse on two occasions: in 1326 he found it to be partly in ruins and in 1349 it had deteriorated to the point that it was no longer possible to enter.\nThroughout the late medieval period, Alexandria re-emerged as a major metropolis and the most important commercial port in Egypt and one of the most important in the Mediterranean. The jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela even described it as “a trading market for all nations”. Indeed, Alexandria was the outlet for all goods coming from Arabia, such as incense, and from India and South-East Asia, such as spices (pepper, cloves, cinnamon, etc.), precious stones, pearls and exotic woods like brazilwood. But it was also the outlet for goods from Africa, such as ivory and precious woods. These goods arrived in Alexandria after passing through Aden on their way to the Red Sea, then headed up the Red Sea to be unloaded in the port of Aydhab. From Aydhab, a caravan took the goods to the Nile, probably to the town of Qus. From there, the goods sailed to Alexandria. These goods then found their way to the Alexandria market alongside Egyptian products.\nThis route was the cheapest and fastest in comparison with the land routes that reached the Mediterranean from Syria or Constantinople. Latin merchants (Venetians, Genoese, Pisans, Aragonese, Provençals, etc.) thus entered this market. As early as the 12th century, the major trading cities had funduqs and consuls in Alexandria. A funduq, in this context is an area, often fortified, within the city dedicated to the community of a trading nation under the authority of a consul. The consul was responsible for adjudicating disputes between merchants of his nation, and also when a subject of the sultan lodged a complaint against a merchant of their nation.The terms of this installation were often set out in treaties between the sultans and the consuls. These treaties were part of a policy pursued by the early Mamluk sultans, who encouraged the arrival of merchants from Europe in Alexandria, since this trade not only brought the sultan considerable revenue, but also enabled him to obtain supplies of wood and iron from Europe. Later, in the 14th century, the Latin trade in Alexandria was also important for the sultans, as it enabled them to obtain supplies of mameluks (slave-soldiers) often sold by Genoese merchants.\n\nAs this trade was very important to the sultans, they were keen to control the city's institutions. Indeed, in Alexandria, in addition to an Emir (governor), the sultan sent a customs inspector who answered directly to the nazir al-khas (person in charge of managing the sultan's patrimony). Customs was not only responsible for collecting customs duties, but also for the security of the port and its warehouses. Alexandria customs also played a role in commercial arbitration and was the preferred circuit for the sale of products brought in by the merchants, which took place at auction. These sales were set up to encourage the merchants to sell their products to or through the sultan, rather than selling them freely on the city's markets. Latin merchants also had jurisdictional privileges : in addition to being judged by their consul if a subject of the sultan lodged a complaint against them, Latin merchants could not be judged by the qadis (civil judges) but had to be judged by the mazalim (the sultan's courts).Alexandria lost much of its importance in international trade after Portuguese navigators discovered a new sea route to India in the late 15th century. This reduced the amount of goods that needed to be transported through the Alexandrian port, as well as the Mamluks' political power. After the Battle of Ridaniya in 1517, the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and remained under Ottoman rule until 1798. Alexandria lost much of its former importance to the Egyptian port city of Rosetta during the 9th to 18th centuries, and it only regained its former prominence with the construction of the Mahmoudiyah Canal in 1820.\nAlexandria figured prominently in the military operations of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the city, which fell to them on 2 September 1801. Muhammad Ali, the Ottoman governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810 and, by 1850, Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory. Egypt turned to Europe in their effort to modernise the country. Greeks, followed by other Europeans and others, began moving to the city. In the early 20th century, the city became a home for novelists and poets.In July 1882, the city came under bombardment from British naval forces and was occupied.\nIn July 1954, the city was a target of an Israeli bombing campaign that later became known as the Lavon Affair. On 26 October 1954, Alexandria's Mansheya Square was the site of a failed assassination attempt on Gamal Abdel Nasser.\nEuropeans began leaving Alexandria following the 1956 Suez Crisis that led to an outburst of Arab nationalism. The nationalisation of property by Nasser, which reached its highest point in 1961, drove out nearly all the rest.\n\nGeography\nAlexandria is located in the country of Egypt, on the southern coast of the Mediterranean. It is in the Far West Nile delta area. It is a densely populated city; its core areas belie its large administrative area. The city's geology constitutes of soil sediments, oolitic sand and clay, oolitic limestone (from the Middle Miocene), grey shelly dolomite, marly dolomite, oncolitic limestone and dolomite, and as well as shelly limestone.\n\nNotes: 2020 CAPMAS projection based on 2017 revised census figures, may differ significantly from 2017 census preliminary tabulations. The 14 kisms were reported simply as Alexandria city by CAPMAS in 2006 but given explosive growth definitions, likely informal, may have changed or may be set to change. Same area with 12 kisms existed in 1996. Kisms are considered 'fully urbanised'\n\nClimate\nAlexandria has a hot steppe climate (Köppen climate classification: BSh), virtually hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification: BWh). Like the rest of Egypt's northern coast, the prevailing north wind, blowing across the Mediterranean, gives the city a less severe climate than the desert hinterland. Rafah and Alexandria are the wettest places in Egypt; the other wettest places are Rosetta, Baltim, Kafr el-Dawwar, and Mersa Matruh. The city's climate is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea, moderating its temperatures, causing variable rainy winters and moderately hot and slightly prolonged summers that, at times, can be very humid; January and February are the coolest months, with daily maximum temperatures typically ranging from 12 to 18 °C (54 to 64 °F) and minimum temperatures that could reach 5 °C (41 °F).\nAlexandria experiences violent storms, rain and sometimes sleet and hail during the cooler months; these events, combined with a poor drainage system, have been responsible for occasional flooding in the city in the past though they rarely occur anymore. July and August are the hottest and driest months of the year, with an average daily maximum temperature of 30 °C (86 °F). The average annual rainfall is around 211 mm (8.3 in) but has been as high as 417 mm (16.4 in)\nPort Said, Kosseir, Baltim, Damietta and Alexandria have the least temperature variation in Egypt.\nThe highest recorded temperature was 45 °C (113 °F) on 30 May 1961, and the coldest recorded temperature was 0 °C (32 °F) on 31 January 1994.\n\nClimate change\nA 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a \"moderate\" scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~2.5–3 °C (4.5–5.4 °F) by 2100, the climate of Alexandria in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Gaza City. The annual temperature would increase by 2.8 °C (5.0 °F), and the temperature of the warmest and the coldest month by 2.9 °C (5.2 °F) and 3.1 °C (5.6 °F). According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with 2.7 °C (4.9 °F), which closely matches RCP 4.5.\nDue to its location on a Nile river delta, Alexandria is one of the most vulnerable cities to sea level rise in the entire world. According to some estimates, hundreds of thousands of people in its low-lying areas may already have to be relocated before 2030. The 2022 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report estimates that by 2050, Alexandria and 11 other major African cities (Abidjan, Algiers, Cape Town, Casablanca, Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Durban, Lagos, Lomé, Luanda and Maputo) would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US$65 billion for the \"moderate\" climate change scenario RCP 4.5 and US$86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5, while RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from marine ice sheet instability at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damages. Additional accounting for the \"low-probability, high-damage events\" may increase aggregate risks to US$187 billion for the \"moderate\" RCP4.5, US$206 billion for RCP8.5 and US$397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario. In every single estimate, Alexandria alone bears around half of these costs. Since sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years under every scenario of climate change, future costs of sea level rise would only increase, especially without adaptation measures. Recent studies published in Earth's Future by the American Geophysical Union indicate that rising sea levels are causing increases in coastal aquifer levels, reaching building foundations and accelerating their corrosion and potential collapse. The study predicts that in 2025, more than 7000 buildings in Alexandria will be at risk of collapse due to these groundwater processes.\n\nAncient layout\nGreek Alexandria was divided into three regions:\n\nRhakotis\nRhakotis (from Coptic Rakotə, \"Alexandria\") was the old city that was absorbed into Alexandria. It was occupied chiefly by Egyptians.\n\nBrucheum\nBrucheum was the Royal or Greek quarter and formed the most magnificent portion of the city. In Roman times, Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal.\n\nJewish quarter\nThe Jewish quarter was the northeast portion of the city.\n\nTwo main streets, lined with colonnades and said to have been each about 60 m (200 ft) wide, intersected in the centre of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his Mausoleum) rose. This point is very near the present mosque of Nebi Daniel; the line of the great East–West \"Canopic\" street is also present in modern-day Alexandria, having only slightly diverged from the line of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharae Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.Alexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a 1,260 m-long (4,130 ft) mole and called the Heptastadion (\"seven stadia\"—a stadium was a Greek unit of length measuring approximately 180 m or 590 ft). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the \"Moon Gate\" rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern \"Ras al-Tin\" quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbour, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbour.\nIn Strabo's time (latter half of the 1st century BC), the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbour.\n\nThe Royal Palaces, filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbour on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the \"Private Port\", and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land subsidence here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.\nThe Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by Julius Caesar as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after he took Egypt after the battle of Pharsalus.\nThe Poseidon, or Temple of the Sea God, close to the theater\nThe Timonium built by Marc Antony\nThe Emporium (Exchange)\nThe Apostases (Magazines)\nThe Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole\nBehind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great obelisks which became known as \"Cleopatra's Needles\" and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.\nThe Gymnasium and the Palaestra are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.\nThe Temple of Saturn; site unknown.\nThe Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.\nThe Musaeum with its famous Library and theater in the same region; site unknown.\nThe Serapeum of Alexandria, the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near \"Pompey's Pillar\", which was an independent monument erected to commemorate Diocletian's siege of the city.\nThe names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, The Great Lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, reputed to be 138 m (453 ft) high, was situated. The first Ptolemy began the project, and the second Ptolemy (Ptolemy II Philadelphus) completed it, at a total cost of 800 talents. It took 12 years to complete and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the Great Pyramid of Giza. A temple of Hephaestus also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.\nIn the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens, according to a census dated from 32 AD, in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves. Estimates of the total population range from 216,000 to 500,000, making it one of the largest cities ever built before the Industrial Revolution and the largest pre-industrial city that was not an imperial capital.\n\nCityscape\nDue to the constant presence of war in Alexandria in ancient times, very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbour and the rest has been built over in modern times.\n\nPompey's Pillar\n\"Pompey's Pillar\", a Roman triumphal column, is one of the best-known ancient monuments still standing in Alexandria today. It is located on Alexandria's ancient acropolis—a modest hill located adjacent to the city's Arab cemetery—and was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its pedestal, it is 30 m (99 ft) high; the shaft is of polished red granite, 2.7 m (8.9 ft) in diameter at the base, tapering to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) at the top. The shaft is 88 ft (27 m) high and made out of a single piece of granite. Its volume is 132 m3 (4,662 cu ft) and weight approximately 396 tons. Pompey's Pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient obelisks. The Romans had cranes, but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several obelisk erecting experiments including a successful attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk.\n\"Pompey's Pillar\" is a misnomer, as it has nothing to do with Pompey, having been erected in 293 for Diocletian, possibly in memory of the rebellion of Domitius Domitianus. The structure was plundered and demolished in the 4th century when a bishop decreed that Paganism must be eradicated. Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god Serapis were enacted and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years, many ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea, mostly pieces of old pottery.\n\nCatacombs of Kom El Shoqafa\nAlexandria's catacombs, known as Kom El Shoqafa, are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large spiral staircase and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other syncretic Romano-Egyptian religious symbols, burial niches, and sarcophagi, as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased. The catacombs were long forgotten by the citizens until they were discovered by accident in 1900.\n\nKom El Deka\nThe most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as Kom El Deka. It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its Roman-era baths.\n\nTemple of Taposiris Magna\nThe temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris, which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir, the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries. Also found in the same area are remains of public baths built by the emperor Justinian, a seawall, quays and a bridge. Near the beach side of the area, there are the remains of a tower built by Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The tower was an exact scale replica of the destroyed Alexandrine Pharos Lighthouse.\n\nCitadel of Qaitbay\nCitadel of Qaitbay is a defensive fortress located on the Mediterranean sea coast. It was established in 1477 AD (882 AH) by the mamluk Sultan Al-Ashraf Sayf al-Din Qa'it Bay. The Citadel is located on the eastern side of the northern tip of Pharos Island at the mouth of the Eastern Harbour. It was erected on the exact site of the famous Lighthouse of Alexandria, which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was built on an area of 17,550 square metres.\n\nExcavation\nPersistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local Archaeological Society and by many individuals. Excavations were performed in the city by Greeks seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great without success.\nThe past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; D. G. Hogarth made tentative researches on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898–1899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.\nSince the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. Cleopatra VII's royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami, leading to gradual subsidence in the 4th century AD. This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team. It raised a noted head of Caesarion. These are being opened up to tourists, to some controversy. The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman strata.\nThe most important results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighbourhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\", where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense catacombs and columbaria have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.\nThe objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in Kom El Shoqafa (Roman) and Ras El Tin (painted).\nThe German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of Kom El Deka, which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.\nThe making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered.\n\nPlaces of worship\nIslam\nThe most famous mosque in Alexandria is Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi Mosque in Bahary. Other notable mosques in the city include Ali ibn Abi Talib mosque in Somouha, Bilal mosque, al-Gamaa al-Bahari in Mandara, Hatem mosque in Somouha, Hoda el-Islam mosque in Sidi Bishr, al-Mowasah mosque in Hadara, Sharq al-Madina mosque in Miami, al-Shohadaa mosque in Mostafa Kamel, Al Qa'ed Ibrahim Mosque, Yehia mosque in Zizinia, Sidi Gaber mosque in Sidi Gaber, Sidi Besher mosque, Rokay el-Islam mosque in Elessway, Elsadaka Mosque in Sidibesher Qebly, Elshatbi mosque and Sultan mosque.\nAlexandria is the base of the Salafi movements in Egypt. Al-Nour Party, which is based in the city and overwhelmingly won most of the Salafi votes in the 2011–12 parliamentary election, supports the president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\nChristianity\nAlexandria was once considered the third-most important city in Christianity, after Rome and Constantinople. Until 430, the Patriarch of Alexandria was second only to the bishop of Rome. The Church of Alexandria had jurisdiction over most of the continent of Africa. After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, the Alexandrian Church split between the Miaphysites and the Melkites. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the Coptic Orthodox Church. The Melkites went on to constitute what is known today as the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria. In the 19th century, Catholic and Protestant missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.\nToday the Patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is Saint Mark Cathedral (though in practice the Patriarch has long resided in Cairo). The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include Pope Cyril I Church in Cleopatra, Saint George's Church in Sporting, Saint Mark and Pope Peter I Church in Sidi Bishr, Saint Mary Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, Saint Mina Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara and Saint Takla Haymanot's Church in Ibrahimeya.\nThe most important Eastern Orthodox churches in Alexandria are Agioi Anárgyroi Church, Church of the Annunciation, Saint Anthony Church, Archangels Gabriel and Michael Church, Taxiarchon Church, Saint Catherine Church, Cathedral of the Dormition in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, Prophet Elijah Church, Saint George Church, Saint Joseph Church in Fleming, Saint Joseph of Arimathea Church, Saint Mark and Saint Nektarios Chapel in Ramleh, Saint Nicholas Church, Saint Paraskevi Church, Saint Sava Cathedral in Ramleh, Saint Theodore Chapel and the Russian church of Saint Alexander Nevsky in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.\nThe Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria in Egypt-Heliopolis-Port Said has jurisdiction over all Latin Catholics in Egypt. Member churches include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the Jesuits in Cleopatra. The city is also the nominal see of the Melkite Greek Catholic titular Patriarchate of Alexandria (generally vested in its leading Patriarch of Antioch) and the actual cathedral see of its Patriarchal territory of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan, which uses the Byzantine Rite, and the nominal see of the Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Alexandria (for all Egypt and Sudan, whose actual cathedral is in Cairo), a suffragan of the Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia, using the Armenian Rite.\nThe Saint Mark Church in Shatby, founded as part of Collège Saint Marc, is multi-denominational and holds liturgies according to Latin Catholic, Coptic Catholic and Coptic Orthodox rites.\nIn antiquity Alexandria was a major centre of the cosmopolitan religious movement called Gnosticism (today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy).\n\nJudaism\nAlexandria's Jewish community declined rapidly following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, after which negative reactions towards Zionism among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city, and elsewhere in Egypt, being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt moved to the newly settled Israel, France, Brazil and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s.  The community once numbered 50,000 but is now estimated at below 50. The most important synagogue in Alexandria is the Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue.\n\nEducation\nColleges and universities\nAlexandria has a number of higher education institutions. Alexandria University is a public university that follows the Egyptian system of higher education. Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its Faculty of Medicine & Faculty of Engineering. In addition, the Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology in New Borg El Arab city is a research university set up in collaboration between the Japanese and Egyptian governments in 2010. The Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for high school, undergraduate level, and postgraduate students. It is considered the most reputable university in Egypt after the AUC American University in Cairo because of its worldwide recognition from board of engineers at UK & ABET in US. Université Senghor is a private French university that focuses on the teaching of humanities, politics and international relations, which mainly recruits students from the African continent. Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT) and Pharos University in Alexandria.\nIn September 2023, The Greek University of Patras announced that it is opening a branch in Alexandria, in a first-of-its-kind move by a Greek higher education institution.  The Greek university of Patras branch will operate two departments, one Greek-speaking and one English-speaking in the subjects of Greek culture, Greek language and Greek philosophy.\n\nSchools\nAlexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by Catholic missionaries include Collège de la Mère de Dieu, Collège Notre Dame de Sion, Collège Saint Marc, Écoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), École Girard, École Saint Gabriel, École Saint-Vincent de Paul, École Saint Joseph, École Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lycée el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Lycée Français d'Alexandrie (École Champollion). It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria. The Italian school is the Istituto \"Don Bosco\".\nEnglish-language schools in Alexandria are the most popular; those in the city include: Riada American School, Riada Language School, Forsan American School, Forsan International School, Alexandria Language School, Future Language School, Future International Schools (Future IGCSE, Future American School and Future German school), Alexandria American School, British School of Alexandria, Egyptian American School, Pioneers Language School, Egyptian English Language School, Princesses Girls' School, Sidi Gaber Language School, Zahran Language School, Taymour English School, Sacred Heart Girls' School, Schutz American School, Victoria College, El Manar Language School for Girls (previously called Scottish School for Girls), Kawmeya Language School, El Nasr Boys' School (previously called British Boys' School), and El Nasr Girls' College (previously called English Girls' College).\nThere are only two German schools in Alexandria which are Deutsche Schule der Borromärinnen (DSB of Saint Charles Borromé) and Neue Deutsche Schule Alexandria, which is run by Frau Sally Hammam.\nThe Montessori educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at Alexandria Montessori.\n\nWomen\nAround the 1890s, twice the percentage of women in Alexandria knew how to read compared to Cairo. As a result, specialist women's publications like al-Fatāh by Hind Nawal, the country's first women's journal, appeared.\n\nTransport\nAirports\nThe city's principal airport is currently Alexandria International Airport, which is located about 25 km (16 mi) away from the city centre, which is now composed of 2 Terminals. Terminal 1 is the old terminal which was opened in February 2010 wherease Terminal 2 is the Brand New Terminal and was inaugurated in 2025.\n\nPort\nAlexandria has four ports; namely the Western Port also known as Alexandria Port, which is the main port of the country that handles about 60% of the country's exports and imports, Dekhela Port west of the Western Port, the Eastern Port which is a yachting harbour, and Abu Qir Port at the northern east of the governorate. It is a commercial port for general cargo and phosphates.\n\nRoads\nAmong the most important are three main roads that run parallel and connect the city center to its eastern parts: Alexandria Corniche (or El-Geish Road), which is approximately 17 km long and connects the Bahary area in the west to the Mandara area in the east; Al-Horreya Road (or Abu Qir Road), about 10 km long, linking the Shallalat area in the west to the Victoria area in the east; and Al-Mahmoudia Axis, which is 23 km long and connects the Qabbari area in the west to the Abis villages in the southeast. In addition to these, there are other major roads such as Fouad Street, considered the oldest street in Alexandria, Malek Hefni Street, Suez Canal Street, Nabi Daniel Street, Port Said Street, Sultan Hussein Street, and the Ring Road. Alexandria also includes several highways that connect it to other cities, such as the Cairo–Alexandria Desert Road, the Cairo–Alexandria Agricultural Road, the International Coastal Road, the Al-Mashir Fouad Abu Zekri Axis, and the Kafoury–Borg El Arab Road.\n\nRail\nAlexandria's intracity commuter rail system extends from Misr Station (Alexandria's primary intercity railway station) to Abu Qir, parallel to the tram line. The commuter line's locomotives operate on diesel, as opposed to the overhead-electric tram.\nAlexandria plays host to two intercity railway stations: the aforementioned Misr Station (in the older Manshia district in the western part of the city) and Sidi Gaber railway station (in the district of Sidi Gaber in the centre of the eastern expansion in which most Alexandrines reside), both of which also serve the commuter rail line. Intercity passenger service is operated by Egyptian National Railways.\n\nTrams\nAn extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa. The network begins at the El Raml district in the west and ends in the Victoria district in the east.\n\nMetro\nConstruction of the Alexandria Metro was due to begin in 2020 at a cost of $1.05 billion.\n\nCulture\nLibraries\nThe Royal Library of Alexandria, in Alexandria, Egypt, was once the largest library in the world. It is generally thought to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC, during the reign of Ptolemy II of Egypt. It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the library complex, the temple of the Muses—the Museion, Greek Μουσείον (from which the Modern English word museum is derived).\nIt has been reasonably established that the library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming). To this day, the details of the destruction (or destructions) remain a lively source of controversy.\nThe Bibliotheca Alexandrina was inaugurated in 2002, near the site of the old Library.\n\nMuseums\nThe Alexandria National Museum was inaugurated 31 December 2003. It is located in a restored Italian style palace in Tariq El Horreya Street (formerly Rue Fouad), near the centre of the city. It contains about 1,800 artifacts that narrate the story of Alexandria and Egypt. Most of these pieces came from other Egyptian museums. The museum is housed in the old Al-Saad Bassili Pasha Palace, who was one of the wealthiest wood merchants in Alexandria. Construction on the site was first undertaken in 1926.\nThe Graeco-Roman Museum was the city's main archeological museum, focused on artifacts from its Greco-Roman period. It was opened in 1892 and was closed in 2005 for extensive renovations and expansion. The museum re-opened to the public in October 2023.\nOther museums in the city include the Cavafy Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, and the Royal Jewelry Museum.\n\nTheaters\nAlexandria Opera House hosts performances of classical music, Arabic music, ballet, and opera.\n\nPoetry\nDuring the Hellenistic period, poets evolving in the court of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (Philiscus of Corcyra, Lycophron, Alexander Aetolus, Sositheus,...) are currently known as the Alexandrian Pleiad.\nIn modern times, Constantine P. Cavafy, a major Greek poet who was born and lived in Alexandria used several themes associated with this city in his work: \"Alexandrian Kings\", \"In Alexandria, 31 B.C.\", \"Myres: Alexandria 340 A.D\", \"Kaisarion\" and \"The God Abandons Antony\". In the latter, Alexandria becomes the symbol of the life whose forthcoming loss must be faced with dignity.\n\nSports\nThe main sport that interests Alexandrians is football, as is the case in the rest of Egypt and Africa. Alexandria Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Alexandria, Egypt. It is currently used mostly for football matches and was used for the 2006 African Cup of Nations. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people. Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the African Cup of Nations in January 2006, which Egypt won. Sea sports such as surfing, jet-skiing and water polo are practiced on a lower scale. The Skateboarding culture in Egypt started in this city. The city is also home to the Alexandria Sporting Club, which is especially known for its basketball team, which traditionally provides the country's national team with key players. The city hosted the AfroBasket, the continent's most prestigious basketball tournament, on four occasions (1970, 1975, 1983, 2003).\nAlexandria has four stadiums:\n\nOther less popular sports like tennis and squash are usually played in private social and sports clubs, like:\n\nAlexandria is also known as the yearly starting point of Cross Egypt Challenge and a huge celebration is conducted the night before the rally starts after all the international participants arrive to the city. Cross Egypt Challenge is an international cross-country motorcycle and scooter rally conducted throughout the most difficult tracks and roads of Egypt.\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nAlexandria is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nAhmed Asmat Abdel-Meguid (1923–2013), Egyptian diplomat\nSoheir Bakhoum (1947–2003), Egyptian numismatist\nConstantine P.

      "summary": "Alexandria is a major city in Egypt. Lying at the western edge of the Nile River Delta, it extends about 40 km (25 mi) along the country's northern coast. It is Egypt's principal seaport, the second largest city after Cairo, and the largest city on the Mediterranean coast. Founded in 331 BC by Alexander the Great, Alexandria is one of the largest and most important cities of antiquity and a leading hub for science, culture, and scholarship. \nNicknamed the \"Bride of the Mediterranean\" and \"Pearl of the Mediterranean Coast\", the city is a popular tourist destination and a major industrial centre. It is the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and in the Middle East, and the eleventh-largest city and urban area in Africa. Alexandria was established originally near an ancient Egyptian settlement named Rhacotis, which later became its Egyptian quarter. The city was made the capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and became the foremost commercial, intellectual, and cultural centre for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity; at one time, it was the most populous city in the ancient world. Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library, the largest in the ancient world; and the Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages.\nAlexandria retained its status as one of the leading cities of the Mediterranean world for almost a millennium, through the period of Roman and Byzantine rule until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, when a new capital was founded at Fustat, now part of Cairo. The city was a major hub of early Christianity and hosted the Patriarchate of Alexandria, one of the leading Christian centres in the Eastern Roman Empire; the modern Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.  \nBy the mid seventh century, Alexandria had already been largely plundered and lost its significance, although it persisted as a trading hub and naval base. From the late 18th century, it was a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world, owing to the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean and Red Seas and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton. Alexandria’s rebirth began in the early 19th century under Muhammad Ali, considered the founder of modern Egypt, who implemented infrastructure projects and modernisation efforts.",

      "content": "الاسْكَنْدَرِيَّه هي العاصمه الثانيه لمصر وكانت عاصمتها قديمًا، وهي عاصمه محافظه الاسكندريه واكبر مدنها، تقع على ساحل البحر الابيض المتوسط شمال غرب دلتا النيل، ويُقدّر طولها بحوالي 55 كم، على مساحه 2523 كم²، يحدها من الشمال البحر الابيض المتوسط، ومن الجنوب محافظه البحيره وبحيره مريوط حتى الكيلو 71 على طريق القاهره الاسكندريه الصحراوي، ويحدها من جهه الشرق محافظه البحيره وخليج ابو قير، ومن الغرب حتى الكيلو 36.30 على الطريق الساحلي الدولي، ومركز برج العرب.\nتضم مدينه الاسكندريه الكثير من المعالم المميزه، اذ يوجد بها اكبر موانئ مصر البحريه وهو ميناء الاسكندريه الذي يمر به نحو 60% من اجمالي الواردات والصادرات المصريه، وتضم ايضًا مكتبه الاسكندريه الجديده التي تحتوي على اكثر من ثمانيه ملايين كتاب، وتستقبل حوالي 1.5 مليون زائر سنويًا، كما تضم العديد من المتاحف مثل متحف الاسكندريه القومي والمتحف اليوناني الروماني، والمواقع الاثريه مثل قلعه قايتباي وعمود السواري، بلغ عدد سكان مدينه الاسكندريه في 1 يوليو 2017 حوالي 5039975 نسمه، يعمل سكانها في مختلف الانشطه الاقتصاديه، وتنقسم الاسكندريه الى تسعه احياء اداريه هي: حي اول المنتزه، حي ثان المنتزه، حي شرق، حي وسط، حي غرب، حي الجمرك، حي العجمي، حي اول العامريه، وحي ثان العامريه.\nبدا العمل على انشاء الاسكندريه على يد الاسكندر الاكبر سنه 331 ق.م.، عن طريق ردم جزء من المياه يفصل بين جزيره ممتده امام الساحل الرئيسي تدعى \"فاروس\" بها ميناء عتيق، وقريه صغيره تدعى \"راكتوس\" او \"راقوده\"، يحيط بها قرى صغيره اخرى تنتشر كذلك ما بين البحر وبحيره مريوط، واتخذها الاسكندر الاكبر وخلفاؤه عاصمه لمصر لما يقرب من الف سنه، حتى الفتح الاسلامي لمصر على يد عمرو بن العاص سنه 641 م، اشتهرت الاسكندريه عبر التاريخ من خلال العديد من المعالم مثل مكتبه الاسكندريه القديمه والتي كانت تضم ما يزيد عن 700000 مجلّد، وفنار الاسكندريه والتي اعتبرت من عجائب الدنيا السبع، وذلك لارتفاعها الهائل الذي يصل الى حوالي 120 مترًا، وظلت هذه المناره قائمه حتى دُمرت جراء زلزال قوي سنه 1307 م.\nيرى بعض المؤرخين ان اختيار الاسكندر الاكبر لمدينه الاسكندريه كي تكون عاصمه لدولته، استهدى في ذلك بتوجيه معلمه الروحي هوميروس في ملحمه الاوديسه، حيث ذهب تليماخوس ابن اوديسيوس ملك ايثاكا، الى مينلاوس ملك اسبرطه يساله ان كان يعرف شيئا عن مصير والده المختفي، فحكى مينلاوس عن اهوال الحرب وشجاعه ملك ايثاكا وجيشه المفقود، وانه بعدما اضنى التعب جيوشهم، بلغوا شواطئ مصر، عند جزيره فاروس، وهناك كما يقول ملك اسبرطه: «كان في مقدورنا ان نُروى من كوثر هذه البلاد التي تجري من تحتها الانهار».\n\nالتاريخ\nالعصور القديمه\nفي بدايه القرن الرابع قبل الميلاد، لم تكن الاسكندريه سوى قريه صغيره تدعى \"راكتوس\" او \"راقوده\" يحيط بها قرى صغيره، يقول عنها علماء الاثار انها ربما كانت تعدّ موقعًا استراتيجيًا لطرد الاقوام التي قد تهجم من حين الى اخر من الناحيه الغربيه لوادي النيل، او لربما كانت «راكتوس» مجرد قريه صغيره تعتمد على الصيد ليس الا، وعلى امتداد الساحل الرئيسي للقريه توجد جزيره تسمى \"جزيره فاروس\" يوجد بها ميناء يخدم الجزيره والقرى الساحليه معًا، في ذلك الوقت كانت مصر تحت الاحتلال الفارسي منذ سقوط حكم الفراعنه والاسره الثلاثون سنه 343 ق م، ولم تكن مصر الوحيده الواقعه تحت احتلال الفرس، فقد كانت بلاد الشام والعراق واقعه تحت هذا الاحتلال، وفي مقابل قوه الفرس كانت قوه الاغريق في ازدياد سريع، وبدات المواجهه بينهما في ربيع سنه 334 ق.م، واستمرت المعارك بينهما حتى دخل الاسكندر الاكبر مدينه صور ومن ثم الى غزه حتى اتم دخول مصر سنه 333 ق م.\nبعد دخول الاسكندر الاكبر مصر وطرده للفرس منها، استقبله المصريون بالترحاب نظرًا للقسوه التي كانوا يُعاملون بها تحت الاحتلال الفارسي، ولكي يؤكد الاسكندر الاكبر انه جاء الى مصر صديقًا وحليفًا وليس غازيًا مستعمرًا، اتجه لزياره معبد الاله امون اله مصر الاعظم في ذلك الوقت، فذهب الى المعبد في واحه سيوه، واجرى له الكهنه طقوس التبني ليصبح الاسكندر الاكبر ابنًا للاله امون، ولُقب فيما بعد بابن امون،  وفي طريقه الى المعبد مرّ بقريه للصيادين كانت تُسمى «راقوده»، فاعجب بالمكان وقرر ان يبني مدينه تحمل اسمه لتكون نقطه وصل بين مصر واليونان وهي مدينه الاسكندريه (باليونانيه القديمه: Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ κατ' Αἴγυπτον؛ وباليونانيه الحديثه: Αλεξάνδρεια)، وعهد ببنائها الى المهندس دينوقراطيس، والذي شيدها على نمط المدن اليونانيه، ونسقها بحيث تتعامد الشوارع الافقيه على الشوارع الراسيه،  وكذلك انشاء جسر يصل بين الجزيره والقريه اُطلق عليه \"هيبتاستاديون\"، وبعد عده شهور ترك الاسكندر مصر متجهًا نحو الشرق ليكمل باقي فتوحاته، ففتح بلاد فارس، لكن طموحاته لم تتوقف عند هذا الحد بل سار بجيشه حتى وصل الى الهند واسيا الوسطى، وبينما كان الاسكندر هناك فاجاه المرض الذي لم يدم طويلاً حيث داهمه الموت بعد عشره ايام وهو لم يتجاوز الاثنين والثلاثين من عمره.\nاتسمت الاسكندريه في مطلعها بالصبغه العسكريه كمدينه للجند الاغريق، ثم تحولت ايام البطالمه الاغريق الى مدينه ملكيه بحدائقها واعمدتها الرخاميه البيضاء وشوارعها المتسعه،  وتحوّلت في ذلك الحين الى عاصمه لمصر، واصبحت احدى حواضر العلوم والفنون بعد ان شيَد فيها البطالمه عددًا من المعالم الكبرى مثل مكتبه الاسكندريه التي تُعد اول معهد ابحاث حقيقي في التاريخ، وفنار الاسكندريه التي اصبحت احد عجائب الدنيا السبع في العالم القديم، وكانت تطل على البحر وجنوب شرقي الميناء الشرقي الذي كان يطلق عليه الميناء الكبير؛ اذا ما قورن بينه وبين ميناء هيراكليون عند ابو قير على فم احد روافد النيل القديمه التي اندثرت، وحالياً انحسر مصب النيل ليصبح على بعد 20 كيلومتراً من ابوقير عند رشيد.\nخضعت المدينه اسميًا للرومان سنه 80 ق م، وفقًا لرغبه بطليموس العاشر، واستمر الامر على هذا المنوال قرابه قرن من الزمن قبل ان تسقط بيد يوليوس قيصر بعد حصار الاسكندريه (47 ق.م)، عندما استغلت روما النزاع والحرب الاهليه القائمه بين بطليموس الثالث عشر ومستشاريه وشقيقته كليوبترا السابعه، وبعد عده معارك انتصر قيصر وتم قتل اخيها، وبذلك استطاعت كليوباترا الانفراد بحكم مصر، وعلى احد اراء بعض المؤرخين فقد تم حرق مكتبه الاسكندريه الشهيره في ذلك الوقت في صراع يوليوس قيصر مع بطليموس الثالث عشر. سقطت المدينه بيد القائد «اوكتافيوس» الذي اصبح لاحقًا الامبراطور «اغسطس» في 1 اغسطس سنه 30 ق م، بعد معركه الاسكندريه، وبهذا اصبحت مصر ولايه رومانيه، ظلت الاسكندريه اكبر مدينه في الامبراطوريه الرومانيه الواسعه بعد روما العاصمه، واقدم الرومان على عمل العديد من الاصلاحات فيها، فقاموا بتجديد واعاده حفر القناه القديمه التي كانت تربط نهر النيل والبحر الاحمر لخدمه التجاره، وكذلك فقد اعطى الرومان لليهود في الاسكندريه والذين كانوا يمثلون جزءًا اساسيًا من التركيبه السكانيه للمدينه، حريات كثيره وسُمح لهم باداره شئونهم الخاصه.\nغير ان كل ذلك لم يوقف حركات التمرد والتوتر في المدينه والتي وصف احد الكتاب القدماء اهلها بانهم \"الاكثر رغبه في الثوره والقتال من اي قوم اخر\"، فمن اعمال الشغب في الاسكندريه سنه 38 وتمرد اليهود سنه 116، والتوتر المتواصل بين اليهود واليونان على مسائل قديمه، فضلاً عن احتجاج السكندريون بصفه عامه على الحكم الروماني، والذي ادى سنه 215 وعلى اثر زياره الامبراطور الروماني الى الاسكندريه الى قتل ما يزيد عن عشرين الف سكندري بسبب قصيده هجاء قيلت في الرجل، غير ان من اهم اسباب الاضطراب هو ان العالم قد شهد احد اهم الاحداث في التاريخ وهو ميلاد الديانه المسيحيه، والتي تزامنت مع بدايه الحكم الروماني في مصر، وحيث ان الديانه الجديده بدات تجذب الكثير من المصريين وتدعوهم الى نبذ الوثنيه وعباده الله، فقد بدا عصر جديد من الاضطهاد حيث كانت روما تريد فرض عباده الامبراطور وكذلك العبادات الوثنيه على المصريين. ضربت موجه تسونامي هائله المدينه بتاريخ 21 يوليو 365،  جرّاء زلزال وقع بالقرب من جزيره كريت، ونجم عنها خراب ودمار كبيرين.\nاكتسبت المسيحيه قوه كبيره رغم كل النزاعات وذلك في مواجهه ديانه باقي المصريين من الوثنيين وخاصه في عهد الامبراطور ثيودوسيوس الكبير (378-395) الذي اصدر مرسوماً ببطلان العبادات الوثنيه، فعقد بطريرك الاسكندريه ثيوفيلوس (385-412) عزمه على تنفيذ المرسوم الامبراطوري بدقه وحزم وقد عاونه اتباعه وقوات الامبراطور، فتم تدمير عدد من المعابد الوثنيه وتحويل بعضها الاخر الى كنائس مثل معبد سرابيوم المقام للاله سيرابيس وذلك سنه 391 حيث شيدت على اطلاله كنيستان.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nخضعت الاسكندريه للامبراطوريه البيزنطيه بعد انقسام الامبراطوريه الرومانيه الى قسمين غربي روماني وشرقي رومي بيزنطي، وفي القرن السابع الميلادي كانت الامبراطوريه البيزنطيه قد وصلت الى حاله بالغه من الضعف، فشجع ذلك الامبراطوريه الفارسيه الساسانيه في الشرق على الهجوم على ممالكها واحتلال الشام ومصر، فدخل الفرس الاسكندريه ونهبوا المدينه وقتلوا الكثير من اهلها، لكن الحكم الفارسي لم يدم الا بضع سنين حيث استطاع الامبراطور هرقل استرداد ممالكه ورجعت الاسكندريه من جديد تابعه للامبراطوريه البيزنطيه، وقد اراد هرقل تعيين بطريرك قوي في الاسكندريه يسند له الرئاسه السياسيه بجانب سلطته الدينيه ليكون قادر على قهر الاقباط وارغامهم على اتباع مذهب المونوثيليتيه فعين بطريركًا رومانيًا يدعى «كيرس» والمعروف عند مؤرخي العرب باسم «المقوقس»، لتحقيق هذه الغايه، الا انه فشل في ذلك، وخلال هذا العهد كان الاسلام قد برز في شبه الجزيره العربيه واستقطب اعدادًا كبيره من الناس، وكان النبي محمد قد ارسل الى حكام الدول المجاوره رسائل يدعوهم فيها الى الاسلام، وكان المقوقس من ضمن هؤلاء الحكام.\n\nبعد وفاه النبي محمد، خرج العرب المسلمون من شبه الجزيره العربيه لنشر الاسلام في انحاء العالم المعروف، فانطلق عمرو بن العاص من القدس الى مصر، بعد ان شاور الخليفه عمر بن الخطاب، سالكًا الطريق التي سلكها قبله قمبيز والاسكندر الاكبر، واصطدمت القوه العربيه بالروم في مدينه الفرما مدخل مصر الشرقي، فسقطت المدينه بيد عمرو، ثم تبعتها بلبيس، وكان المقوقس عامل الروم على مصر قد تحصن بحصن ازاء جزيره الروضه على نهر النيل، ورابط عمرو في عين شمس، ولما وصلت الامدادات من الخليفه عمر، تقاتل الفريقان في منتصف الطريق بين المعسكرين،  فانهزم المقوقس واحتمى بالحصن، ولمّا ضيّق عمرو عليه الحصار اضطر الى القبول بدفع الجزيه،  وتابع عمرو استيلائه على المدن المصريه ولم يبق الا الاسكندريه عاصمه الديار المصريه وثانيه حواجز الامبراطوريه البيزنطيه، وكان الاسطول البيزنطي يحميها من البحر، ولكن شدّه الغارات البريّه العربيه، وموت هرقل وارتقاء ابنه قسطنطين الثاني عرش الامبراطوريه وكان حديث السن، جعلت الروم يوافقون على شروط الصلح، فجلت قواتهم واسطولهم عن المدينه ودخلها المسلمين فاتحين، واطلقوا الحريه الدينيه للاقباط وامّنوهم على ممتلكاتهم وارواحهم.\n\nولكن بعد مده قصيره من السيطره على المدينه قام البيزنطيون بهجوم مضاد ليستعيدوا المدينه من جديد الا ان عمرو بن العاص استطاع هزيمتهم ودخل الاسكندريه مره اخرى في صيف سنه 646، ورحب الاقباط في الاسكندريه بقياده البطريرك بنيامين الاول بالمسلمين ترحيبًا بالغًا وبذلك فقدت الامبراطوريه البيزنطيه اغنى ولاياتها الى الابد، فقدت الاسكندريه مكانتها السياسيه بعد ذلك بسبب اتخاذ عمرو بن العاص من الفسطاط عاصمه له بدلاً منها، لكنها استمرت الميناء الرئيسي لمصر وابرز مرافئها التجاريه، نشطت حركه التجاره في الاسكندريه خلال العهد الاسلامي، كذلك تم بناء سور جديد للمدينه، ووفد اليها الكثير من العلماء من امثال الامام الشاطبي والحافظ السلفي وابن خلدون وغيرهم الذين اثروا الحركه العلميه للمدينه، ومن المعالم التي تركتها المرحله الاولى للفتح ضريح وجامع ابو الدرداء احد صحابه النبي محمد في منطقه العطارين والذي شارك في فتح مصر.\nتعرضت الاسكندريه لحصار عُرف بحصار الاسكندريه (1174) من جانب الاسطول الصقلي كجزء من الحملات الصليبيه ضد الشرق، الا انه فشل فشل ذريعًا، وتعرضت كذلك لعده زلازل قويه سنه 956 ثم 1303 ثم 1323 ادت الى تحطم فنار الاسكندريه ولم يبق منها سوى الاساس الحجري الذي شيدت عليه قلعه قايتباي في منتصف القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي، كما تعرضت الاسكندريه لهجمات صليبيه كان اخرها في اكتوبر سنه 1365 عانت فيها من اعمال قتل دون تمييز بين مسلم ومسيحي ونهب وضربت المساجد،  الا انه وفي سنه 1480 قام السلطان المملوكي قايتباي ببناء حصن للمدينه لحمايتها في نفس موقع المناره والمعروفه الان بقلعه قايتباي، حيث حظيت الاسكندريه في عهده بعنايه كبيره، وقد هيات الدوله المملوكيه وسائل الراحه لاقامه التجار الاوروبيين في مينائي الاسكندريه ودمياط فبنيت دور الاقامه ووضعت تحت تصرف التجار حتى يعيشوا وفق النمط الذي اعتادوه في بلادهم، وفي وقت لاحق فقدت الاسكندريه الكثير من اهميتها بعد اكتشاف طريق راس الرجاء الصالح في سنه 1498 وتحوّل طريق التجاره الى المحيط الاطلسي بدلاً من البحر الابيض المتوسط، وكذلك بعد جفاف فرع نهر النيل والقناه التي كانت تمد المدينه بالمياه العذبه.\n\nالعصور الحديثه\nخضعت الاسكندريه مع باقي مصر الى الحكم العثماني بعد انتصار السلطان سليم الاول على المماليك في معركه الريدانيه ودخل مصر سنه 1517، شهدت الاسكندريه احداثًا مهمه خلال القرن الثامن عشر تمثلت بالحمله الفرنسيه على مصر ودخول الجنود الفرنسيه بقياده نابليون بونابرت الاسكندريه في اوائل يوليو 1798 بدون مقاومه تُذكر، واعتبرت الدوله العثمانيه احتلال بونابرت لمصر اعتداءً عليها، ووقف الانجليز والروس الى جانب العثمانيين وعرضوا المساعده على الباب العالي لاخراج الفرنسيين من مصر،  وسرعان ما التحمت القوات البريطانيه مع الفرنسيه في معركه الاسكندريه (1801) في معركه ادت لخروج القوات الفرنسيه من مصر،  لتدخل الاسكندريه ومصر بصفه عامه مرحله جديده مليئه بالنهضه في جميع المجالات.\n\nتدين الاسكندريه لمحمد علي باشا بالنهضه حيث انه اعاد للمدينه الحياه بعدّه وسائل ففي سنه 1820 تم الانتهاء من حفر قناه المحموديه لربط الاسكندريه بنهر النيل مما كان له الفضل في انعاش اقتصاد الاسكندريه،  وقد صمم الميناء الغربي كي يكون هو الميناء الرسمي لمصر وتم بناء مناره حديثه عند مدخله، كذلك فان منطقه المنشيه هي بالاساس من تصميم مهندسيه، كما شيد محمد علي عند راس التين مقره المفضل واصبحت الاسكندريه هي مقر قناصل الدول الغربيه مما جعل لها شخصيه اوروبيه حيث جذبت العديد من الفرنسيين واليونانيين واليهود والشوام بسبب الانتعاشه التي حظيت بها المدينه،  كما انشا دار الصناعه البحريه في المدينه والتي يطلق عليها حالياً \"ترسانه الاسكندريه\"، وذلك لتلبيه احتياجات الاسطول المصري على يد المهندس الفرنسي سيريزى بك.\n\nاصبحت الاسكندريه منذ تولي محمد علي الحكم وخلال المائه وخمسين سنه التاليه اهم ميناء في البحر المتوسط ومركزًا مهما للتجاره الخارجيه،  ومقرًا لسكان متعددي الاعراق واللغات والثقافات، وتحت حكم خلفاء محمد علي استمرت الاسكندريه في النمو الاقتصادي، فشهدت في عهد الخديوي اسماعيل تحديداً اهتماماً يُشابه الاهتمام الذي اولاه لتخطيط مدينه القاهره، فانشا بها الشوارع والاحياء الجديده وتمت اناره الاحياء والشوارع بغاز المصابيح بواسطه شركه اجنبيه،  وانشات بها جهه خاصه للاعتناء بتنظيم شوارعها وللقيام باعمال النظافه والصحه والصيانه فيها، ووضعت شبكه للصرف الصحي وتصريف مياه الامطار،  وتم رصف الكثير من شوارع المدينه، وقامت احدى الشركات الاوروبيه بتوصيل المياه العذبه من منطقه المحموديه الى المدينه وتوزيعها بواسطه \"وابور مياه\" الاسكندريه، وانشات في المدينه مباني ضخمه وعمارات سكنيه فخمه في عدد من الاحياء كمنطقه محطه الرمل وكورنيش بحري.\n\nتعرضت الاسكندريه خلال هذه العصر الحديث الى الكثير من الاحداث وخاصه بعد مذبحه الاسكندريه وعند بدايه الاحتلال البريطاني لمصر، حيث قام الاسطول البريطاني بقصف الاسكندريه لمده يومين متواصلين حتى استسلمت المدينه معلنهً بدايه الاحتلال البريطاني لمصر،  والذي دام لسبعين عامًا،  وتحت الاحتلال البريطاني زاد عدد الاجانب وخاصه اليونان الذين اصبحوا يمثلون مركزًا ثقافيًا وماليًا مهم في المدينه،  وتحولت الاسكندريه وقناه السويس الى مواقع استراتيجيه مهمه للقوات البريطانيه،  تعرضت المدينه لاضرار هائله في فتره الحرب العالميه الثانيه،  حيث كانت تقصفها الطائرات الحربيه لدول المحور خصوصًا الايطاليه والالمانيه ما تسبب في دمار ومقتل المئات واعتبرت الاسكندريه اكثر المدن المصريه تضرراً من تلك الحرب،  وبعد نهايه الحرب العالميه الثانيه وقيام حركه 23 يوليو 1952 اُلغيت الملكيه في مصر وغادر الملك فاروق الاول اخر ملوك الاسره العلويه الى المنفى،  وقامت الجمهوريه المصريه على انقاض المملكه بقياده جمال عبد الناصر الذي اعلن من الاسكندريه وبالتحديد في ميدان المنشيه تاميم قناه السويس،  وقد قلت اعداد الجاليات الاجنبيه في الاسكندريه بعد سياسه التاميم التي اتبعها عبد الناصر وكذلك بسبب الحروب التي خاضتها مصر مع اسرائيل، الا انه ما يزال هناك جاليه يونانيه بسيطه في المدينه. وفي 12 سبتمبر 1955 تعرضت الاسكندريه لزلزال بقوه 6.3 على مقياس ريختر، تسبب في في مقتل 18 شخصًا واصابه 89 شخصًا حيث انهار 40 منزلًا بالكامل و420 منزلًا بشكل جزئي، وكان للاسكندريه حضور سياسي حيث استضافت مؤتمر قمه الدول العربيه 1964 والذي اقُيم في قصر المنتزه بحضور اربعه عشر زعيمًا عربيًا.\n\nالمرحله المعاصره\nبعد بدايه سنه 2011 بعشرين دقيقه حدث انفجار كبير امام كنيسه القديسين في منطقه سيدي بشر اثناء الاحتفالات بعيد الميلاد للكنائس الشرقيه، نجم عنه 24 قتيلًا (بينهم مسلمون) كما اصيب 97 شخصًا،  احدثت هذه العمليه صدمه في مصر وفي العالم كله، واتهمت وزاره الداخليه المصريه تنظيم جيش الاسلام الفلسطيني بالمسئوليه عن الحادث،  واحتج كثير من المسيحيين في الشوارع وهتفوا بشعارات ضد نظام حكم مبارك، وانضم بعض المسلمين للاحتجاجات، وحدثت اشتباكات بين الشرطه والمحتجين في الاسكندريه والقاهره.\nبعد نجاح الثوره التونسيه واسقاط نظام الرئيس زين العابدين بن علي،  انتقلت روح الثوره الى مصر، فخرج الالاف من الاشخاص الى شوارع القاهره والاسكندريه وغيرها من المدن المصريه مطالبين بتحسين الوضع المعيشي وخفض الاسعار وتحسين الوضع الاجتماعي للناس. وقد بدات المظاهرات بالاسكندريه بمنطقه المنشيه والعطارين ومحطه الرمل والمنتزه وسيدي جابر. وقد تعاظم شانها وازداد عدد المشاركين بها مع مرور الوقت، مطالبين بتنحي الرئيس حسني مبارك، اسفرت المظاهرات التي بدات في 25 يناير عن تنحي حسني مبارك،  فكان من شان ذلك تهدئه الاوضاع بعض الشيء في المدينه وتفريق المتظاهرين.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالموقع\nتقع مدينه الاسكندريه شمال مصر على ساحل البحر الابيض المتوسط عند التقاء خط العرض 31° 11' 34.6 شمال، وخط الطول 29° 54' 17.5 شرق، وهي عباره عن شريط ساحلي بطول حوالي 55 كم شمال غرب دلتا النيل بدءاً من ابو قير شرقًا وحتى سيدي كرير غربًا، على مساحه 2523 كم²، يحدها من الشمال البحر الابيض المتوسط، ومن الجنوب محافظه البحيره وبحيره مريوط حتى الكيلو 71.5 على طريق القاهره الاسكندريه الصحراوي،  ومن الشرق محافظه البحيره وخليج ابو قير،  ومن الغرب منطقه سيدي كرير حتى الكيلو 36.30 على الطريق الساحلي الدولي ومركز ومدينه برج العرب،  والتربه في مدينه الاسكندريه سهليه منبسطه على ارتفاع -1 من مستوى سطح البحر.\n\nالمناخ\nتتميز الاسكندريه بمناخ معتدل، اذ يسود بها مناخ البحر المتوسط والذي يتميز بصيفه الحار والجاف وشتائه الرطب والمعتدل والممطر، يمتد فصل الشتاء في الاسكندريه عبر شهور ديسمبر، يناير، وفبراير وتترواح درجه الحراره العظمى فيه ما بين 12 و 18 درجه مئويه، وتتعرض الاسكندريه خلال هذا الفصل الى العديد من العواصف الرعديه الشديده والبرد والامطار الغزيره في ظاهره جويه يُطلق عليها \"نوه\"، اما فصل الصيف في الاسكندريه، فيمتد عبر شهور يونيو، يوليو، واغسطس وتترواح درجه الحراره فيه ما بين 25 و 30 درجه مئويه،  ويتميز صيف الاسكندريه بالجفاف وارتفاع نسبه الرطوبه، اما فصلي الربيع والخريف فيعدّان افضل وقت لزياره المدينه، وفيهما لا تزيد درجه الحراره العظمى عن 22 درجه مئويه باستثناء زمن الموجات الخماسينيه التي تصل فيها الحراره في اشهر الربيع الى 32 درجه مئويه احيانًا.\n\nالتخطيط والتقسيم الاداري\nلم يكن تخطيط مدينه الاسكندريه مختلفًا عن السابق بل كان تخطيطاً اشبه بالمدن الاغريقيه القديمه، حيث كان ياخذ شكل شطرنج وهو عباره عن شارعين رئيسيين ومتقاطعين بزاويه قائمه هما شارع «كانوبك» وشارع «سوما» وعرض كل منهما 14 متر، ومنهما تتفرع شوارع جانبيه متوازيه عرضها 7 امتار،  وكان شارع «كانوبك» (شارع فؤاد حاليًا) يربط بوابه القمر من الغرب وبوابه الشمس من الشرق، ويمتد شرقًا ليربط مدينه كانوب (ابو قير)، وكان يتقاطع شارع سوما (شارع النبي دانيال حاليًا) مع شارع كانوبك ويمتد من الشمال للجنوب، وتقاطعهما كان مركز مدينه الاسكندريه.\nاتسعت الاسكندريه في القرن العشرين اتساعًا كبيرًا، وتوسّع العمران بها في الاتجاهين الشرقي والغربي خاصه، بالاضافه الى الاتجاه الجنوبي. بالنسبه للتوسع نحو الجنوب فقد امتد العمران في منطقه محرم بك الى ترعه المحموديه ومنطقه غيط العنب، وحاليًا توسعت المدينه نحو الشرق وساعد على ذلك وجود قطار ابو قير الذي ساعد في نمو العمران الى مناطق سيدي بشر، المندره، والمعموره وصولاً الى ابو قير،  اما التوسع نحو الغرب فشمل مناطق المكس والدخيله والكيلو 21 وصولاً الى سيدي كرير، حتى بلغ طول الشريط الساحلي للاسكندريه حوالي 55 كم،  كما توسعت المدينه جنوبًا حتى وصلت الى مناطق الكافوري والعامريه وحدود محافظه البحيره.\nتنقسم مدينه الاسكندريه حاليًا الى تسعه احياء اداريه هي:\n\nحي اول المنتزه يضم قسم اول المنتزه ويتبعه تسعه شياخات و96 قريه بتوابعها، ومن اهم مناطقه ميامي، سيدي بشر، فيكتوريا، والعوايد.\nحي ثان المنتزه يضم قسم ثان المنتزه، ويتبعه

السياحه، الزراعه، الصناعه، الصيد، شركات القطاع الخاص، الوظائف الحكوميه، والاعمال الحره والحرفيه، ويتحدث السكان اللغه العربيه باللهجه السكندريه، حيث تاثرت اللهجه والثقافه السكندريه بوجود عدد كبير من الاجانب في المدينه لان معظم الاجانب مثل الايطاليين واليونانيين كانوا كانوا يفضلون البقاء بالاسكندريه لتمتعها بمناخ حوض البحر المتوسط، ولعل من ابرز الكلمات الموجوده في اللهجه السكندريه كلمه \"مَنَفِيسْتُو\" ويُقصد بها الكتيبات الصغيره جدًا التي يستخدمها التلاميذ واصلها ايطالي، وكلمه \"جُومَه\" والمقصود بها الممحاه واصلها كذلك ايطالي، وايضاً كلمه \"مَسْتِيكَه\" والمقصود بها اللبان او العلك، واصلها ايطالي كذلك، بالاضافه الى ذلك فهناك العديد من احياء المدينه يعود اصل تسميتها لاشخاص اجانب عاشوا بالاسكندريه مثل لوران، جليم، سموحه، بولكلي، كرموز، راغب، ونجت، وفلمنج، كما يتحدث عدد من السكان اللهجه البدويه وهم الافراد المنُحدرين من القبائل العربيه، ويسكن اغلبهم بمناطق غرب الاسكندريه، وايضًا العديد من الوافدين من المحافظات المصريه الاخرى والذين يتحدثون بلهجاتهم الاصليه، تعتبر الاسكندريه من اكثر المدن المصريه كثافه بالسكان نسبه الى اجمالي مساحتها، حيث تبلغ الكثافه السكانيه في المدينه حوالي 1997 نسمه للكيلو متر المربع، وبلغ عدد سكان مدينه الاسكندريه في 1 يوليو 2024 حوالي 5,408,311 نسمه مُقسمين كالتالي:\n\nالثقافه\nتُعقد في الاسكندريه العديد من النشاطات الثقافيه، السياحيه، والسياسيه خاصه بعد اختيارها كعاصمه الكتاب العالميه سنه 2002، وعاصمه الثقافه الاسلاميه لسنه 2008،

الطفل، قصر التذوق، مركز الحريه للابداع، قصر ثقافه الانفوشي، قصر ثقافه سيدي جابر، قصر ثقافه ابوقير.\n\nالدين\nالاسلام\nيعتنق اغلب السكندريين الاسلام دينًا على منهج اهل السنه والجماعه، وقد انتشر الاسلام في المدينه انتشارًا كبيرًا بعد ان فتحها عمرو بن العاص في القرن السابع حتى طغى على المسيحيه التي كانت سائده قبل هذا، وتتميز الاسكندريه باحتضانها للعديد من المدارس والمنشات الدينيه الاسلاميه وعشرات المساجد الكبيره الاثريه والتي تتركز اغلبها في ميدان المساجد بحي الجمرك.\nومن اشهر المساجد الموجوده الاسكندريه مسجد ابو العباس المرسي، مسجد القائد ابراهيم، مسجد الشيخ ابراهيم، مسجد محمد كريم، مسجد

الى العديد من المساجد والزوايا المنتشره في كافه احياء المدينه.\n\nالمسيحيه\nبعد ان اعلنت المسيحيه ديانه رسميه للامبراطوريه الرومانيه، اصبحت الاسكندريه مركزًا لبطريركيه من البطريركيات الخمس الكبرى، بعد ان تقرر انشائها في مجمع نيقيه الاول سنه 451، وكان من ضمن الذين كتبوا قانون مجمع نيقه، احد ابناء الكنيسه القبطيه وهو البابا اثناسيوس بابا الاسكندريه الذي استمر على كرسيه لمده 46 عامًا، وتُعدّ مدرسه الاسكندريه المسيحيه اول مدرسه من نوعها في العالم، فبعد نشاتها سنه 190 على يد بنتينوس السكندرى، اصبحت مدرسه الاسكندريه اهم معهد للتعليم الديني في المسيحيه. كثير من الاساقفه البارِزين من عِدَّه انحاء في العالم تعلموا في تلك المدرسه، مثل اثيناغوارس، اكليمندس الاسكندري، ديديموس الضرير، واوريجانوس الذي يُعتبر اب علم اللاهوت.\nيتبع معظم المسيحيين السكندريين الكنيسه القبطيه الارثوذكسيه، وتعتبر الكاتدرائيه المرقسيه الكنيسه الاولى وفيها حسب التقليد راس القديس مارمرقس الرسول، ويتبع بعضًا من المسيحيين الاخرين في المدينه كنيسه الروم الارثوذكس، كما اعتنق عدد من السكان المذهب الكاثوليكي والبروتستانتي خلال القرن التاسع عشر عندما وصلت عدّه بعثات تبشيريه من اوروبا والولايات المتحده الى الشرق وعملت على نشر مذهبها، ويمثل اتباع هذه الكنائس اليوم اقليه مسيحيه في الاسكندريه، ومن اشهر الكنائس القبطيه في المدينه الكاتدرائيه المرقسيه، كاتدرائيه سانت كاترين، كنيسه الانبا تكلاهيمانوت، كنيسه السيده العذراء ومارجرجس، كنيسه القديس سابا، كنيسه القديسين، وبطريركيه الاسكندريه للروم الارثوذكس، والعديد من الكنائس الاخرى في مختلف احياء المدينه.\n\nاليهوديه\nكانت الاسكندريه موطنًا كبيرًا للجاليه اليهوديه، لكنها اليوم في عداد المندثره، خصوصًا بعد ان رحل الكثير من اليهود المصريين والاجانب الى اسرائيل بعد قيامها، او بسبب ترحيل البعض الاخر في عهد الرئيس جمال عبد الناصر اما لاتهامهم بالعمل الجاسوسي لصالح اسرائيل، او بسبب الخوف من اقدامهم على ذلك، كان عدد يهود الاسكندريه في القرن التاسع عشر نحو اربعه الاف يهودي، ووصل عددهم الى ثمانيه عشر الفًا في اوائل القرن العشرين، وارتفع الى اربعين الفًا سنه 1948،  وكان نصف يهود الاسكندريه من اليهود المصريين والنصف الاخر ينقسم الى ثلاثه اقسام اولهم اللادينو من سكان حوض البحر الابيض المتوسط الذين هاجروا من اسبانيا والثلث الثاني من يهود ايطاليا وشرقي اوروبا، والثلث الثالث من يهود المغرب والشرق الاوسط الذين يتحدثون العربيه،  وفي اوائل عقد الثلاثينات من القرن العشرين هاجرت مجموعه من يهود السالونيك، النمسا، المجر، وبولندا الى مصر هربًا من صعود النازيه في المانيا،  ومن اشهر المعالم اليهوديه الباقيه في المدينه اليوم، كنيس الياهو هانبي (بالعبريه: בית הכנסת אליהו הנביא)، الذي يقع في شارع النبي دانيال بوسط المدينه،  وهو مغلق حاليًا ولا يُستخدم في طقوس العباده.\n\nالسياحه والاثار\nالمناطق الاثريه\nالمتاحف\nالقصور\nالخدمات\nالتعليم\nالتعليم قبل الجامعي\n\nتضم الاسكندريه عددًا كبيرًا من المدارس بكافه مراحلها التعليميه رياض الاطفال، الابتدائي، الاعدادي، والثانوي، وبمجالاته العامه والفنيه والازهريه، ويرتبط ذلك بارتفاع المستوى الثقافي والتعليمي للسكان خاصه فيما يتعلق

      "summary": "الإسْكَنْدَرِيَّة هي العاصمة الثانية لمصر وكانت عاصمتها قديمًا، وهي عاصمة محافظة الإسكندرية وأكبر مدنها، تقع على ساحل البحر الأبيض المتوسط شمال غرب دلتا النيل، ويُقدّر طولها بحوالي 55 كم، على مساحة 2523 كم²، يحدها من الشمال البحر الأبيض المتوسط، ومن الجنوب محافظة البحيرة وبحيرة مريوط حتى الكيلو 71 على طريق القاهرة الإسكندرية الصحراوي، ويحدها من جهة الشرق محافظة البحيرة وخليج أبو قير، ومن الغرب حتى الكيلو 36.30 على الطريق الساحلي الدولي، ومركز برج العرب.\nتضم مدينة الإسكندرية الكثير من المعالم المميزة، إذ يوجد بها أكبر موانئ مصر البحرية وهو ميناء الإسكندرية الذي يمر به نحو 60% من إجمالي الواردات والصادرات المصرية، وتضم أيضًا مكتبة الإسكندرية الجديدة التي تحتوي على أكثر من ثمانية ملايين كتاب، وتستقبل حوالي 1.5 مليون زائر سنويًا، كما تضم العديد من المتاحف مثل متحف الإسكندرية القومي والمتحف اليوناني الروماني، والمواقع الأثرية مثل قلعة قايتباي وعمود السواري، بلغ عدد سكان مدينة الإسكندرية في 1 يوليو 2017 حوالي 5039975 نسمة، يعمل سكانها في مختلف الأنشطة الاقتصادية، وتنقسم الإسكندرية إلى تسعة أحياء إدارية هي: حي أول المنتزة، حي ثان المنتزة، حي شرق، حي وسط، حي غرب، حي الجمرك، حي العجمي، حي أول العامرية، وحي ثان العامرية.\nبدأ العمل على إنشاء الإسكندرية على يد الإسكندر الأكبر سنة 331 ق.م.، عن طريق ردم جزء من المياه يفصل بين جزيرة ممتدة أمام الساحل الرئيسي تدعى \"فاروس\" بها ميناء عتيق، وقرية صغيرة تدعى \"راكتوس\" أو \"راقودة\"، يحيط بها قرى صغيرة أخرى تنتشر كذلك ما بين البحر وبحيرة مريوط، واتخذها الإسكندر الأكبر وخلفاؤه عاصمة لمصر لما يقرب من ألف سنة، حتى الفتح الإسلامي لمصر على يد عمرو بن العاص سنة 641 م، اشتهرت الإسكندرية عبر التاريخ من خلال العديد من المعالم مثل مكتبة الإسكندرية القديمة والتي كانت تضم ما يزيد عن 700000 مجلّد، وفنار الإسكندرية والتي اعتبرت من عجائب الدنيا السبع، وذلك لارتفاعها الهائل الذي يصل إلى حوالي 120 مترًا، وظلت هذه المنارة قائمة حتى دُمرت جراء زلزال قوي سنة 1307 م.\nيرى بعض المؤرخين أن اختيار الإسكندر الأكبر لمدينة الإسكندرية كي تكون عاصمة لدولته، استهدى في ذلك بتوجيه معلمه الروحي هوميروس في ملحمة الأوديسة، حيث ذهب تليماخوس ابن أوديسيوس ملك إيثاكا، إلى مينلاوس ملك إسبرطة يسأله إن كان يعرف شيئا عن مصير والده المختفي، فحكى مينلاوس عن أهوال الحرب وشجاعة ملك إيثاكا وجيشه المفقود، وأنه بعدما أضنى التعب جيوشهم، بلغوا شواطئ مصر، عند جزيرة فاروس، وهناك كما يقول ملك إسبرطة: «كان في مقدورنا أن نُروى من كوثر هذه البلاد التي تجري من تحتها الأنهار».",
