          "content": "Cairo is the capital and largest city of Egypt and the Cairo Governorate, being home to more than 10 million people. It is also part of the largest urban agglomeration in Africa, the Arab world, and the Middle East. The Greater Cairo metropolitan area is one of the largest in the world by population with over 22 million people.\nThe area that would become Cairo was part of ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex and the ancient cities of Memphis and Heliopolis are near-by. Located near the Nile Delta, the predecessor settlement was Fustat following the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 next to an existing ancient Roman fortress, Babylon. Subsequently, Cairo was founded by the Fatimid dynasty in 969. It later superseded Fustat as the main urban centre during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods (12th–16th centuries).\nCairo has since become a longstanding centre of political and cultural life, and is titled \"the city of a thousand minarets\" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture. Cairo's historic center was awarded World Heritage Site status in 1979. Cairo is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification according to GaWC. The city is also a center of finance and commerce, academics and the arts, and is home to Cairo Symphony Orchestra and the Cairo Opera House, while the Academy of Arts provides visual arts education. Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industry in the Arab world, as well as Egypt's oldest institution of higher learning, Al-Azhar University. Many international media, businesses, and organisations have regional headquarters in Cairo. The Arab League has had its headquarters in Cairo for most of its existence.\nCairo, like many other megacities, suffers from high levels of pollution and traffic. The Cairo Metro, opened in 1987, is the oldest metro system in Africa, and ranks amongst the fifteen busiest in the world, with over 1 billion annual passenger rides. The economy of Cairo was ranked first in the Middle East in 2005, and 43rd globally on Foreign Policy's 2010 Global Cities Index.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of Cairo is derived from the Arabic al-Qāhirah (القاهرة), meaning 'the Vanquisher' or 'the Conqueror', given by the Fatimid Caliph al-Mu'izz following the establishment of the city as the capital of the Fatimid dynasty. Its full, formal name was al-Qāhirah al-Mu'izziyyah (القاهرة المعزيّة), meaning 'the Vanquisher of al-Mu'izz'. It is also supposedly due to the fact that the planet Mars, known in Arabic by names such as an-Najm al-Qāhir (النجم القاهر, 'the Conquering Star'), was rising at the time of the city's founding.\nEgyptians often refer to Cairo as Maṣr (IPA: [mɑsˤɾ]; مَصر), the Egyptian Arabic name for Egypt itself, emphasising the city's importance for the country.\nThere are a number of Coptic names for the city. Tikešrōmi (Coptic: Ϯⲕⲉϣⲣⲱⲙⲓ Late Coptic: [dikɑʃˈɾoːmi]) is attested in the 1211 text The Martyrdom of John of Phanijoit and is either a calque meaning 'man breaker' (Ϯ-, 'the', ⲕⲁϣ-, 'to break', and ⲣⲱⲙⲓ, 'man'), akin to Arabic al-Qāhirah, or a derivation from Arabic قَصْر الرُوم (qaṣr ar-rūm, \"the Roman castle\"), another name of Babylon Fortress in Old Cairo. The Arabic name is also calqued as ⲧⲡⲟⲗⲓⲥ ϯⲣⲉϥϭⲣⲟ, \"the victor city\" in the Coptic antiphonary.\nThe form Khairon (Coptic: ⲭⲁⲓⲣⲟⲛ) is attested in the modern Coptic text Ⲡⲓⲫⲓⲣⲓ ⲛ̀ⲧⲉ ϯⲁⲅⲓⲁ ⲙ̀ⲙⲏⲓ Ⲃⲉⲣⲏⲛⲁ (The Tale of Saint Verina). Lioui (Ⲗⲓⲟⲩⲓ Late Coptic: [lɪˈjuːj]) or Elioui (Ⲉⲗⲓⲟⲩⲓ Late Coptic: [ælˈjuːj]) is another name which is descended from the Greek name of Heliopolis (Ήλιούπολις). Some argue that Mistram (Ⲙⲓⲥⲧⲣⲁⲙ Late Coptic: [ˈmɪstəɾɑm]) or Nistram (Ⲛⲓⲥⲧⲣⲁⲙ Late Coptic: [ˈnɪstəɾɑm]) is another Coptic name for Cairo, although others think that it is rather a name for the Abbasid province capital al-Askar. Ⲕⲁϩⲓⲣⲏ (Kahi•ree) is a popular modern rendering of an Arabic name (others being Ⲕⲁⲓⲣⲟⲛ [Kairon] and Ⲕⲁϩⲓⲣⲁ [Kahira]) which is modern folk etymology meaning 'land of sun'. Some argue that it was  the name of an Egyptian settlement upon which Cairo was built, but it is rather doubtful as this name is not attested in any Hieroglyphic or Demotic source, although some researchers, like Paul Casanova, view it as a legitimate theory. Cairo is also referred to as Ⲭⲏⲙⲓ (Late Coptic: [ˈkɪmi]) or Ⲅⲩⲡⲧⲟⲥ (Late Coptic: [ˈɡɪpdos]), which means Egypt in Coptic, the same way it is referred to in Egyptian Arabic.\nSometimes the city is informally referred to as Cairo by people from Alexandria (IPA: [ˈkæjɾo]; Egyptian Arabic: كايرو).\n\nHistory\nAncient settlements\nThe area around present-day Cairo had long been a focal point of Ancient Egypt due to its strategic location at the junction of the Nile Valley and the Nile Delta regions (roughly Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt), which also placed it at the crossing of major routes between North Africa and the Levant. Memphis, the capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom and a major city up until the Ptolemaic period, was located a short distance south west of present-day Cairo. Heliopolis, another important city and major religious center, was located in what are now the modern districts of Matariya and Ain Shams in northeastern Cairo. It was largely destroyed by the Persian invasions in 525 BC and 343 BC and partly abandoned by the late first century BC.\nHowever, the origins of modern Cairo are generally traced back to a series of settlements in the first millennium AD. Around the turn of the fourth century, as Memphis was continuing to decline in importance, the Romans established a large fortress along the east bank of the Nile. The fortress, called Babylon, was built by the Roman emperor Diocletian (r. 285–305) at the entrance of a canal connecting the Nile to the Red Sea that was created earlier by Emperor Trajan (r. 98–117). Further north of the fortress, near the present-day district of al-Azbakiya, was a port and fortified outpost known as Tendunyas (Coptic: ϯⲁⲛⲧⲱⲛⲓⲁⲥ) or Umm Dunayn. While no structures older than the 7th century have been preserved in the area aside from the Roman fortifications, historical evidence suggests that a sizeable city existed. The city was important enough that its bishop, Cyrus, participated in the Second Council of Ephesus in 449.\nThe Byzantine-Sassanian War between 602 and 628 caused great hardship and likely caused much of the urban population to leave for the countryside, leaving the settlement partly deserted. The site today remains at the nucleus of the Coptic Orthodox community, which separated from the Roman and Byzantine churches in the late 4th century. Cairo's oldest extant churches, such as the Church of Saint Barbara and the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (from the late 7th or early 8th century), are located inside the fortress walls in what is now known as Old Cairo or Coptic Cairo.\n\nFustat and other early Islamic settlements\nThe Muslim conquest of Byzantine Egypt was led by Amr ibn al-As from 639 to 642. Babylon Fortress was besieged in September 640 and fell in April 641. In 641 or early 642, after the surrender of Alexandria, the Egyptian capital at the time, he founded a new settlement next to Babylon Fortress. The city, known as Fustat (Arabic: الفسطاط, romanised: al-Fusṭāṭ, lit. 'the tent'), served as a garrison town and as the new administrative capital of Egypt. Historians such as Janet Abu-Lughod and André Raymond trace the genesis of present-day Cairo to the foundation of Fustat. \nThe choice of founding a new settlement at this inland location, instead of using the existing capital of Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast, may have been due to the new conquerors' strategic priorities. One of the first projects of the new Muslim administration was to clear and re-open Trajan's ancient canal in order to ship grain more directly from Egypt to Medina, the capital of the caliphate in Arabia. Ibn al-As also founded a mosque for the city at the same time, now known as the Mosque of Amr Ibn al-As, the oldest mosque in Egypt and Africa (although the current structure dates from later expansions).\n\nIn 750, following the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate by the Abbasids, the new rulers created their own settlement to the northeast of Fustat which became the new provincial capital. This was known as al-Askar (Arabic: العسكر, lit. 'the camp') as it was laid out like a military camp. A governor's residence and a new mosque were also added, with the latter completed in 786. The Red Sea canal re-excavated in the 7th century was closed by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775), but a part of the canal, known as the Khalij, continued to be a major feature of Cairo's geography and of its water supply until the 19th century. In 861, on the orders of the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil, a Nilometer was built on Roda Island near Fustat. Although it was repaired and given a new roof in later centuries, its basic structure is still preserved today, making it the oldest preserved Islamic-era structure in Cairo today.\n\nIn 868, a commander of Turkic origin named Bakbak was sent to Egypt by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mu'taz to restore order after a rebellion in the country. He was accompanied by his stepson, Ahmad ibn Tulun, who became effective governor of Egypt. Over time, Ibn Tulun gained an army and accumulated influence and wealth, allowing him to become the de facto independent ruler of both Egypt and Syria by 878. In 870, he used his growing wealth to found a new administrative capital, al-Qata'i (Arabic: القطائـع, lit. 'the allotments'), to the northeast of Fustat and of al-Askar. \nThe new city included a palace known as the Dar al-Imara, a parade ground known as al-Maydan, a bimaristan (hospital), and an aqueduct to supply water. Between 876 and 879 Ibn Tulun built a great mosque, now known as the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, at the center of the city, next to the palace. After his death in 884, Ibn Tulun was succeeded by his son and his descendants who continued a short-lived dynasty, the Tulunids. In 905, the Abbasids sent general Muhammad Sulayman al-Katib to re-assert direct control over the country. Tulunid rule was ended and al-Qatta'i was razed to the ground, except for the mosque which remains standing today.\n\nFoundation and expansion of Cairo under the Fatimids\nIn 969, the Fatimid Caliphate conquered Egypt after ruling from Ifriqiya. The Fatimid Caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah instructed his courtier and general Jawhar al-Saqili to establish a new fortified city northeast of Fustat and of former al-Qata'i. It took four years to build the city, initially known as al-Manṣūriyyah, which was to serve as the new capital of the caliphate. During that time, the construction of the al-Azhar Mosque was commissioned by order of the caliph, which developed into the third-oldest university in the world. Cairo would eventually become a centre of learning, with the library of Cairo containing hundreds of thousands of books. When Caliph al-Mu'izz arrived from the old Fatimid capital of Mahdia in Tunisia in 973, he gave the city its present name, Qāhirat al-Mu'izz (\"The Vanquisher of al-Mu'izz\"), from which the name \"Cairo\" (al-Qāhira) originates. The caliphs lived in a vast and lavish palace complex that occupied the heart of the city. Cairo remained a relatively exclusive royal city for most of this era, but during the tenure of Badr al-Gamali as vizier (1073–1094) the restrictions were loosened for the first time and richer families from Fustat were allowed to move into the city. Between 1087 and 1092 Badr al-Gamali also rebuilt the city walls in stone and constructed the city gates of Bab al-Futuh, Bab al-Nasr, and Bab Zuweila that still stand today.\nDuring the Fatimid period Fustat reached its apogee in size and prosperity, acting as a center of craftsmanship and international trade and as the area's main port on the Nile. Historical sources report that multi-story communal residences existed in the city, particularly in its center, which were typically inhabited by middle and lower-class residents. Some of these were as high as seven stories and could house some 200 to 350 people. They may have been similar to Roman insulae and may have been the prototypes for the rental apartment complexes which became common in the later Mamluk and Ottoman periods. However, in 1168 the Fatimid vizier Shawar set fire to the unfortified Fustat to prevent its potential capture by Amalric, the Crusader king of Jerusalem. While the fire did not destroy the city and it continued to exist afterward, it did mark the beginning of its decline. Over the following centuries it was Cairo, the former palace-city, that became the new economic center and attracted migration from Fustat.\n\nWhile the Crusaders did not capture the city in 1168, a continuing power struggle between Shawar, King Amalric, and the Zengid general Shirkuh led to the downfall of the Fatimid establishment. In 1169, Shirkuh's nephew Saladin was appointed as the new vizier of Egypt by the Fatimids and two years later he seized power from the family of the last Fatimid caliph, al-'Āḍid. As the first Sultan of Egypt, Saladin established the Ayyubid dynasty, based in Cairo, and aligned Egypt with the Sunni Abbasids, who were based in Baghdad. In 1176, Saladin began construction on the Cairo Citadel, which was to serve as the seat of the Egyptian government until the mid-19th century. The construction of the Citadel definitively ended Fatimid-built Cairo's status as an exclusive palace-city and opened it up to common Egyptians and to foreign merchants, spurring its commercial development. Along with the Citadel, Saladin also began the construction of a new 20-kilometre-long wall that would protect both Cairo and Fustat on their eastern side and connect them with the new Citadel. These construction projects continued beyond Saladin's lifetime and were completed under his Ayyubid successors.\n\nFurther expansion and decline under the Ayyubids and Mamluks\nIn 1250, during the Seventh Crusade, the Ayyubid dynasty had a crisis with the death of al-Salih and power transitioned instead to the Mamluks, partly with the help of al-Salih's wife, Shajar ad-Durr, who ruled for a brief period around this time. Mamluks were soldiers who were purchased as young slaves and raised to serve in the sultan's army. Between 1250 and 1517 the throne of the Mamluk Sultanate passed from one mamluk to another in a system of succession that was generally non-hereditary, but also frequently violent and chaotic. The Mamluk Empire nonetheless became a major power in the region and was responsible for repelling the advance of the Mongols (most famously at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260) and for eliminating the last Crusader states in the Levant.\nDespite their military character, the Mamluks were also prolific builders and left a rich architectural legacy throughout Cairo. Continuing a practice started by the Ayyubids, much of the land occupied by former Fatimid palaces was sold and replaced by newer buildings, becoming a prestigious site for the construction of Mamluk religious and funerary complexes. Construction projects initiated by the Mamluks pushed the city outward while also bringing new infrastructure to the centre of the city. Meanwhile, Cairo flourished as a centre of Islamic scholarship and a crossroads on the spice trade route among the civilisations in Afro-Eurasia. Under the reign of the Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Muhammad (1293–1341, with interregnums), Cairo reached its apogee in terms of population and wealth. By 1340, Cairo had a population of close to half a million, making it the largest city west of China.\nMulti-story buildings occupied by rental apartments, known as a rab' (plural ribā' or urbu), became common in the Mamluk period and continued to be a feature of the city's housing during the later Ottoman period. These apartments were often laid out as multi-story duplexes or triplexes. They were sometimes attached to caravanserais, where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were rented out to tenants. The oldest partially-preserved example of this type of structure is the Wikala of Amir Qawsun, built before 1341. Residential buildings were in turn organised into close-knit neighbourhoods called a harat, which in many cases had gates that could be closed off at night or during disturbances.\n\nWhen the traveller Ibn Battuta first came to Cairo in 1326, he described it as the principal district of Egypt. When he passed through the area again on his return journey in 1348, the Black Death was ravaging most major cities. He cited reports of thousands of deaths per day in Cairo. Although Cairo avoided Europe's stagnation during the Late Middle Ages, it could not escape the Black Death, which struck the city more than fifty times between 1348 and 1517. \nDuring its initial, and most deadly waves, approximately 200,000 people were killed by the plague, and, by the 15th century, Cairo's population had been reduced to between 150,000 and 300,000. The population decline was accompanied by a period of political instability between 1348 and 1412. It was nonetheless in this period that the largest Mamluk-era religious monument, the Madrasa-Mosque of Sultan Hasan, was built. In the late 14th century, the Burji Mamluks replaced the Bahri Mamluks as rulers of the Mamluk state, but the Mamluk system continued to decline.\nThough the plagues returned frequently throughout the 15th century, Cairo remained a major metropolis and its population recovered in part through rural migration. More conscious efforts were conducted by rulers and city officials to redress the city's infrastructure and cleanliness. Its economy and politics also became more deeply connected with the wider Mediterranean. Some Mamluk sultans in this period, such as Barbsay (r. 1422–1438) and Qaytbay (r. 1468–1496), had relatively long and successful reigns. After al-Nasir Muhammad, Qaytbay was one of the most prolific patrons of art and architecture of the Mamluk era. He built or restored numerous monuments in Cairo, in addition to commissioning projects beyond Egypt. The crisis of Mamluk power and of Cairo's economic role deepened after Qaytbay. The city's status was diminished after Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around the Cape of Good Hope between 1497 and 1499, thereby allowing spice traders to avoid Cairo.\n\nOttoman rule\nCairo's political influence diminished significantly after the Ottomans defeated Sultan al-Ghuri in the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516 and conquered Egypt in 1517. Ruling from Constantinople, Sultan Selim I relegated Egypt to a province, with Cairo as its capital. For this reason, the history of Cairo during Ottoman times is often described as inconsequential, especially in comparison to other time periods.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, Cairo still remained an important economic and cultural centre. Although no longer on the spice route, the city facilitated the transportation of Yemeni coffee and Indian textiles, primarily to Anatolia, North Africa, and the Balkans. Cairene merchants were instrumental in bringing goods to the barren Hejaz, especially during the annual hajj to Mecca. It was during this same period that al-Azhar University reached the predominance among Islamic schools that it continues to hold today; pilgrims on their way to hajj often attested to the superiority of the institution, which had become associated with Egypt's body of Islamic scholars. The first printing press of the Middle East, printing in Hebrew, was established in Cairo c. 1557 by a scion of the Soncino family of printers, Italian Jews of Ashkenazi origin who operated a press in Constantinople. The existence of the press is known solely from two fragments discovered in the Cairo Geniza.\n\nUnder the Ottomans, Cairo expanded south and west from its nucleus around the Citadel. The city was the second-largest in the empire, behind Constantinople, and, although migration was not the primary source of Cairo's growth, twenty percent of its population at the end of the 18th century consisted of religious minorities and foreigners from around the Mediterranean. Still, when Napoleon arrived in Cairo in 1798, the city's population was less than 300,000, forty percent lower than it was at the height of Mamluk—and Cairene—influence in the mid-14th century.\nThe French occupation was short-lived as British and Ottoman forces, including a sizeable Albanian contingent, recaptured the country in 1801. Cairo itself was besieged by a British and Ottoman force culminating with the French surrender on 22 June 1801. The British vacated Egypt two years later, leaving the Ottomans, the Albanians, and the long-weakened Mamluks jostling for control of the country. Continued civil war allowed an Albanian named Muhammad Ali Pasha to ascend to the role of commander and eventually, with the approval of the religious establishment, viceroy of Egypt in 1805.\n\nModern era\nUntil his death in 1848, Muhammad Ali Pasha instituted a number of social and economic reforms that earned him the title of founder of modern Egypt. However, while Muhammad Ali initiated the construction of public buildings in the city, those reforms had minimal effect on Cairo's landscape. Bigger changes came to Cairo under Isma'il Pasha (r. 1863–1879), who continued the modernisation processes started by his grandfather. Drawing inspiration from Paris, Isma'il envisioned a city of maidans and wide avenues; due to financial constraints, only some of them, in the area now composing Downtown Cairo, came to fruition. Isma'il also sought to modernise the city, which was merging with neighbouring settlements, by establishing a public works ministry, bringing gas and lighting to the city, and opening a theatre and opera house.\nThe immense debt resulting from Isma'il's projects provided a pretext for increasing European control, which culminated with the British invasion in 1882. The city's economic centre quickly moved west toward the Nile, away from the historic Islamic Cairo section and toward the contemporary, European-style areas built by Isma'il. Europeans accounted for five percent of Cairo's population at the end of the 19th century, by which point they held most top governmental positions.\nIn 1906, the Heliopolis Oasis Company headed by the Belgian industrialist Édouard Empain and his Egyptian counterpart Boghos Nubar, built a suburb called Heliopolis (city of the sun in Greek) ten kilometers from the center of Cairo. In 1905–1907 the northern part of the Gezira island was developed by the Baehler Company into Zamalek, which would later become Cairo's upscale \"chic\" neighbourhood. In 1906 construction began on Garden City, a neighbourhood of urban villas with gardens and curved streets.\n\nThe British occupation was intended to be temporary, but it lasted well into the 20th century. Nationalists staged large-scale demonstrations in Cairo in 1919, five years after Egypt had been declared a British protectorate. Nevertheless, this led to Egypt's independence in 1922.\nThe King Fuad I Edition of the Qur'an was first published on 10 July 1924 in Cairo under the patronage of King Fuad. The goal of the government of the newly formed Kingdom of Egypt was not to delegitimise the other variant Quranic texts (\"qira'at\"), but to eliminate errors found in Qur'anic texts used in state schools. A committee of teachers chose to preserve a single one of the canonical qira'at \"readings\", namely that of the \"Ḥafṣ\" version, an 8th-century Kufic recitation. This edition has become the standard for modern printings of the Quran for much of the Islamic world. The publication has been called a \"terrific success\", and the edition has been described as one \"now widely seen as the official text of the Qur'an\", so popular among both Sunni and Shi'a that the common belief among less well-informed Muslims is \"that the Qur'an has a single, unambiguous reading\". Minor amendments were made later in 1924 and in 1936 - the \"Faruq edition\" in honour of then ruler, King Faruq.\n\nBritish occupation until 1956\nBritish troops remained in the country until 1956. During this time, urban Cairo, spurred by new bridges and transport links, continued to expand to include the upscale neighbourhoods of Garden City, Zamalek, and Heliopolis. Between 1882 and 1937, the population of Cairo more than tripled—from 347,000 to 1.3 million—and its area increased from 10 to 163 km2 (4 to 63 sq mi).\nThe city was devastated during the 1952 riots known as the Cairo Fire or Black Saturday, which saw the destruction of nearly 700 shops, movie theatres, casinos and hotels in downtown Cairo. The British departed Cairo following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, but the city's rapid growth showed no signs of abating. Seeking to accommodate the increasing population, President Gamal Abdel Nasser redeveloped Tahrir Square and the Nile Corniche, and improved the city's network of bridges and highways. Meanwhile, additional controls of the Nile fostered development within Gezira Island and along the city's waterfront. The metropolis began to encroach on the fertile Nile Delta, prompting the government to build desert satellite towns and devise incentives for city-dwellers to move to them.\n\nAfter 1956\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Cairo continued to grow enormously in both population and area. Between 1947 and 2006, the population of Greater Cairo went from 2,986,280 to 16,292,269. The population explosion also drove the rise of \"informal\" housing ('ashwa'iyyat), meaning housing that was built without any official planning or control. The exact form of this type of housing varies considerably but usually has a much higher population density than formal housing. By 2009, over 63% of the population of Greater Cairo lived in informal neighbourhoods, even though these occupied only 17% of the total area of Greater Cairo. According to economist David Sims, informal housing has the benefits of providing affordable accommodation and vibrant communities to huge numbers of Cairo's working classes, but it also suffers from government neglect, a relative lack of services, and overcrowding.\nThe \"formal\" city was also expanded. The most notable example was the creation of Madinat Nasr, a huge government-sponsored expansion of the city to the east which officially began in 1959 but was primarily developed in the mid-1970s. Starting in 1977 the Egyptian government established the New Urban Communities Authority to initiate and direct the development of new planned cities on the outskirts of Cairo, generally established on desert land. These new satellite cities were intended to provide housing, investment, and employment opportunities for the region's growing population as well as to pre-empt the further growth of informal neighbourhoods. As of 2014, about 10% of the population of Greater Cairo lived in the new cities.\nConcurrently, Cairo established itself as a political and economic hub for North Africa and the Arab world, with many multinational businesses and organisations, including the Arab League, operating out of the city. In 1979 the historic districts of Cairo were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nIn 1992, Cairo was hit by an earthquake causing 545 deaths, injuring 6,512 and leaving around 50,000 people homeless.\n\n2011 Egyptian revolution\nCairo's Tahrir Square was the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian revolution against former president Hosni Mubarak. More than 50,000 protesters first occupied the square on 25 January, during which the area's wireless services were reported to be impaired. In the following days Tahrir Square continued to be the primary destination for protests in Cairo. The uprising was mainly a campaign of non-violent civil resistance, which featured a series of demonstrations, marches, acts of civil disobedience, and labour strikes. Millions of protesters from a variety of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.\nDespite being predominantly peaceful in nature, the revolution was not without violent clashes between security forces and protesters, with at least 846 people killed and 6,000 injured. The uprising took place in Cairo, Alexandria, and in other cities in Egypt, following the Tunisian revolution that resulted in the overthrow of the long-time Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. On 11 February, following weeks of determined popular protest and pressure, Hosni Mubarak resigned from office.\n\nPost-revolutionary Cairo\nUnder the rule of President el-Sisi, in March 2015 plans were announced for another yet-unnamed planned city to be built further east of the existing satellite city of New Cairo, intended to serve as the new capital of Egypt.\n\nGeography\nCairo is located in northern Egypt, known as Lower Egypt, 165 km (100 mi) south of the Mediterranean Sea and 120 km (75 mi) west of the Gulf of Suez and Suez Canal. The city lies along the Nile River, immediately south of the point where the river leaves its desert-bound valley and branches into the low-lying Nile Delta region. Although the Cairo metropolis extends away from the Nile in all directions, the city of Cairo resides only on the east bank of the river and two islands within it on a total area of 453 km2 (175 sq mi). Geologically, Cairo lies on alluvium and sand dunes which date from the quaternary period.\nUntil the mid-19th century, when the river was tamed by dams, levees, and other controls, the Nile in the vicinity of Cairo was highly susceptible to changes in course and surface level. Over the years, the Nile gradually shifted westward, providing the site between the eastern edge of the river and the Mokattam highlands on which the city now stands. The land on which Cairo was established in 969 (present-day Islamic Cairo) was located underwater just over three hundred years earlier, when Fustat was first built.\nLow periods of the Nile during the 11th century continued to add to the landscape of Cairo; a new island, known as Geziret al-Fil, first appeared in 1174, but eventually became connected to the mainland. Today, the site of Geziret al-Fil is occupied by the Shubra district. The low periods created another island at the turn of the 14th century that now composes Zamalek and Gezira. Land reclamation efforts by the Mamluks and Ottomans further contributed to expansion on the east bank of the river.\nBecause of the Nile's movement, the newer parts of the city—Garden City, Downtown Cairo, and Zamalek—are located closest to the riverbank. The areas, which are home to most of Cairo's embassies, are surrounded on the north, east, and south by the older parts of the city. Old Cairo, located south of the centre, holds the remnants of Fustat and the heart of Egypt's Coptic Christian community, Coptic Cairo. The Boulaq district, which lies in the northern part of the city, was born out of a major 16th-century port and is now a major industrial centre. \nThe Citadel is located east of the city centre around Islamic Cairo, which dates back to the Fatimid era and the foundation of Cairo. While western Cairo is dominated by wide boulevards, open spaces, and modern architecture of European influence, the eastern half, having grown haphazardly over the centuries, is dominated by small lanes, crowded tenements, and Islamic architecture.\nNorthern and extreme eastern parts of Cairo, which include satellite towns, are among the most recent additions to the city, as they developed in the late-20th and early-21st centuries to accommodate the city's rapid growth. The western bank of the Nile is commonly included within the urban area of Cairo, but it composes the city of Giza and the Giza Governorate. Giza city has also undergone significant expansion over recent years, and today has a population of 2.7 million. The Cairo Governorate was just north of the Helwan Governorate from 2008 when some Cairo's southern districts, including Maadi and New Cairo, were split off and annexed into the new governorate, to 2011 when the Helwan Governorate was reincorporated into the Cairo Governorate.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the level of air pollution in Cairo is nearly 12 times higher than the recommended safety level.\n\nClimate\nIn Cairo, and along the Nile River Valley, the climate is a hot desert climate (BWh according to the Köppen climate classification system).\nWind storms can be frequent, bringing Saharan dust into the city, from March to May and the air often becomes uncomfortably dry. Winters are mild to warm, while summers are long and hot. High temperatures in winter range from 14 to 22 °C (57 to 72 °F), while night-time lows drop to below 11 °C (52 °F), often to 5 °C (41 °F). In summer, the highs often exceed 31 °C (88 °F) but rarely surpass 40 °C (104 °F), and lows drop to about 20 °C (68 °F). Rainfall is sparse and only happens in the colder months, but sudden showers can cause severe flooding. The summer months have high humidity due to its proximity to the Mediterranean coast. Snowfall is extremely rare; a small amount of graupel, widely believed to be snow, fell on Cairo's easternmost suburbs on 13 December 2013, the first time Cairo's area received this kind of precipitation in many decades. Dew points in the hottest months range from 13.9 °C (57 °F) in June to 18.3 °C (65 °F) in August.\n\nMetropolitan area and districts\nThe city of Cairo forms part of Greater Cairo, the largest metropolitan area in Africa. While it has no administrative body, the Ministry of Planning considers it as an economic region consisting of Cairo Governorate, Giza Governorate, and Qalyubia Governorate. As a contiguous metropolitan area, various studies have considered Greater Cairo be composed of the administrative cities that are Cairo, Giza and Shubra al-Kheima, in addition to the satellite cities/new towns surrounding them.\nCairo is a city-state where the governor is also the head of the city. Cairo City itself differs from other Egyptian cities in that it has an extra administrative division between the city and district levels, and that is areas, which are headed by deputy governors. Cairo consists of 4 areas (manatiq, singl. mantiqa) divided into 38 districts (ahya', singl. hayy) and 46 qisms (police wards, 1-2 per district):\nThe Northern Area is divided into 8 Districts:\n\nShubra\nAl-Zawiya al-Hamra\nHadayek al-Qubba\nRod al-Farg\nAl-Sharabia\nAl-Sahel\nAl-Zeitoun\nAl-Amiriyya\n\nThe Eastern Area divided into 9 Districts and three new cities:\n\nMisr al-Gadidah and Al-Nozha (Heliopolis)\nNasr City East and Nasr City West\nAl-Salam 1 (Awwal) and al-Salam 2 (Than)\nAin Shams\nAl-Matariya\nAl-Marg\nShorouk (Under jurisdiction of NUCA)\nBadr (Under jurisdiction of NUCA)\nAl-Qahira al-Gadida (New Cairo, three qisms, under jurisdiction of NUCA)\n\nThe Western Area divided into 9 Districts:\n\nManshiyat Nasser\nAl-Wayli (Incl. qism al-Daher)\nWasat al-Qahira (Central Cairo, incl. Al-Darb al-Ahmar, al-Gamaliyya qisms)\nBulaq\nGharb al-Qahira (West Cairo, incl. Zamalek qism, Qasr al-Nil qism incl. Garden City and part of Down Town)\nAbdeen\nAl-Azbakiya\nAl-Muski\nBab al-Sha'aria\n\nThe Southern Area divided into 12 Districts:\n\nMasr El-Qadima (Old Cairo, including Al-Manial)\nAl-Khalifa\nAl-Moqattam\nAl-Basatin\nDar al-Salam\nSayyidah Zainab District\nEl Tebbin\nHelwan\nAl-Ma'sara\nAl-Maadi\nTora\n15th of May (Under jurisdiction of NUCA)\n\nSatellite cities\nSince 1977 a number of new towns have been planned and built by the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) in the Eastern Desert around Cairo, ostensibly  to accommodate additional population growth and development of the city and stem the development of self-built informal areas, especially over agricultural land. As of 2022 four new towns have been built and have residential populations: 15th of May City, Badr City, Shorouk City, and New Cairo. In addition, two more are under construction: the New Administrative Capital. And Capital Gardens, where land was allocated in 2021, and which will house most of the civil servants employed in the new capital.\n\nPlanned new capital\nIn March 2015, plans were announced for a new city to be built east of Cairo, in an undeveloped area of the Cairo Governorate, which would serve as the New Administrative Capital of Egypt. Cairo also introduced more modern metro lines to reduce traffic in central areas.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2017 census, Cairo had a population of 9,539,673 people, distributed across 46 qisms (police wards):\n\nReligion\nThe majority of Egypt and Cairo's population is Sunni Muslim. A significant Christian minority exists, among whom Coptic Orthodox are the majority. Precise numbers for each religious community in Egypt are not available and estimates vary. Other churches that have, or had, a presence in modern Cairo include the Catholic Church (including Armenian Catholic, Coptic Catholic, Chaldean Catholic, Syrian Catholic, and Maronite), the Greek Orthodox Church, the Evangelical Church of Egypt (Synod of the Nile), and some Protestant churches. Cairo has been the seat of the Coptic Orthodox Church since the 12th century, and the seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope is located in Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral. Until the 20th century, Cairo had a sizeable Jewish community, but as of 2022 only three Jews were reported to be living in the city. A total of 12 synagogues in Cairo still exist.\n\nEconomy\nCairo's economy has traditionally been based on governmental institutions and services, with the modern productive sector expanding in the 20th century to include developments in textiles and food processing – specifically the production of sugar cane. As of 2005, Egypt has the largest non-oil based GDP in the Arab world.\nCairo accounts for 11% of Egypt's population and 22% of its economy (PPP). The majority of the nation's commerce is generated there, or passes through the city. The great majority of publishing houses and media outlets and nearly all film studios are there, as are half of the nation's hospital beds and universities. This has fuelled rapid construction in the city, with one building in five being less than 15 years old.\nThis growth until recently surged well ahead of city services. Homes, roads, electricity, telephone and sewer services were all in short supply. Analysts trying to grasp the magnitude of the change coined terms like \"hyper-urbanization\".\n\nAutomobile manufacturers from Cairo\nArab American Vehicles Company (vehicles by Stellantis alliance)\nEgyptian Light Transport Manufacturing Company (Egyptian NSU pedant)\nGhabbour Group (Fuso, Hyundai and Volvo)\nMCV Corporate Group (a part of the Daimler AG)\nMod Car\nSeoudi Group (Modern Motors: Nissan, BMW (formerly); El-Mashreq: Alfa Romeo and Fiat)\nSperanza (former Daewoo Motors Egypt; Chery, Daewoo)\nGeneral Motors Egypt\n\nInfrastructure\nHealth\nCairo, as well as neighbouring Giza, has been established as Egypt's main centre for medical treatment, and despite some exceptions, has the most advanced level of medical care in the country. Cairo's hospitals include the JCI-accredited As-Salaam International Hospital, Ain Shams University Hospital, Dar Al Fouad, Nile Badrawi Hospital, 57357 Hospital, as well as Qasr El Eyni Hospital.\n\nEducation\nGreater Cairo has long been the hub of education and educational services for Egypt and the region.\nToday, Greater Cairo is the centre for many government offices governing the Egyptian educational system, has the largest number of educational schools, and higher education institutes among other cities and governorates of Egypt.\nSome of the International Schools found in Cairo:\n\nUniversities in Greater Cairo:\n\nTransport\nCairo has an extensive road network, rail system, subway system and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles, taxi cabs, privately owned public buses and microbuses. Cairo International Airport is the country's largest airport and one of the busiest airports in Africa.\n\nPublic transportation\nCairo, specifically Ramses Station, is the centre of almost the entire Egyptian transportation network. The Cairo Transportation Authority (CTA) manages Cairo's public transit and runs the Cairo Metro. The metro network covers Helwan and other suburbs. It can get very crowded during rush hour. Two train cars (the fourth and fifth ones) are reserved for women only, although women may ride in any car they want. Trams in Greater Cairo and Cairo trolleybus were used as modes of transportation, but were closed in the 1970s everywhere except Heliopolis and Helwan. These were shut down in 2014, after the Egyptian Revolution. In 2022, the Cairo Light Rail Transit system opened. Despite the name, the CLRT is more like a commuter rail system than a Light Rail system. As of 2025, the system consists of a single bifurcating line of 12 stations over 70 km, with a top speed of 12p km/h. In 2017, plans to construct two monorail systems were announced, one linking 6th of October to suburban Giza, a distance of 35 km (22 mi), and the other linking Nasr City to New Cairo, a distance of 52 km (32 mi).\n\nRoads\nTwo trans-African automobile routes originate in Cairo: the Cairo-Cape Town Highway and the Cairo-Dakar Highway. An extensive road network connects Cairo with other Egyptian cities and villages. There is a new Ring Road that surrounds the outskirts of the city, with exits that reach outer Cairo districts. There are flyovers and bridges, such as the 6th October Bridge that, when the traffic is not heavy, allow fast means of transportation from one side of the city to the other.\nCairo traffic is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded. Traffic moves at a relatively fluid pace. Drivers tend to be aggressive, but are more courteous at junctions, taking turns going, with police aiding in traffic control of some congested areas.\n\nOther forms of transport\nBolt\nCairo Nile Ferry\nCairo Taxi/Yellow Cab\nCareem\nDiDi\nUber\n\nCulture\nCultural tourism in Egypt\nCairo Opera House\nPresident Mubarak inaugurated the new Cairo Opera House of the Egyptian National Cultural Centres on 10 October 1988, 17 years after the Royal Opera House had been destroyed by fire. The National Cultural Centre was built with the help of JICA, the Japan International Co-operation Agency and stands as a prominent feature for the Japanese-Egyptian co-operation and the friendship between the two nations.\n\nKhedivial Opera House\nThe Khedivial Opera House, or Royal Opera House, was the original opera house in Cairo. It was dedicated on 1 November 1869 and burned down on 28 October 1971. After the original opera house was destroyed, Cairo was without an opera house for nearly two decades until the opening of the new Cairo Opera House in 1988.\n\nCairo International Film Festival\nCairo held its first international film festival 16 August 1976, when the first Cairo International Film Festival was launched by the Egyptian Association of Film Writers and Critics, headed by Kamal El-Mallakh. The Association ran the festival for seven years until 1983.\nThis achievement lead to the President of the Festival again contacting the FIAPF with the request that a competition should be included at the 1991 Festival. The request was granted.\nIn 1998, the Festival took place under the presidency of one of Egypt's leading actors, Hussein Fahmy, who was appointed by the Minister of Culture, Farouk Hosni, after the death of Saad El-Din Wahba. Four years later, the journalist and writer Cherif El-Shoubashy became president.\n\nCairo Geniza\nThe Cairo Geniza is an accumulation of almost 200,000 Jewish manuscripts that were found in the genizah of the Ben Ezra Synagogue (built 882) of Fustat, Egypt (now Old Cairo), the Basatin cemetery east of Old Cairo, and a number of old documents that were bought in Cairo in the later 19th century. These documents were written from about 870 to 1880 AD and have been archived in various American and European libraries. The Taylor-Schechter collection in the University of Cambridge runs to 140,000 manuscripts; a further 40,000 manuscripts are housed at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.\n\nSports\nFootball is the most popular sport in Egypt, and Cairo has sporting teams that compete in national and regional leagues, most notably Al Ahly and Zamalek SC, who were the CAF first and second African clubs of the 20th century. The annual match between Al Ahly and El Zamalek is one of the most watched sports events in Egypt. The teams form the major rivalry of Egyptian football. They play their home games at Cairo International Stadium, which is the second largest stadium in Egypt, as well as the largest in Cairo.\nThe Cairo International Stadium was built in 1960. Its multi-purpose sports complex houses the main football stadium, an indoor stadium, satellite fields that hold regional and continental games, including the African Games, U17 Football World Championship and the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations. Egypt later won the competition and the next edition in Ghana (2008) making the Egyptian and Ghanaian national teams the only to win the African Nations Cup back to back. Egypt won the title for a record six times in the history of African Continental Competition. This was followed by a third consecutive win in Angola in 2010, making Egypt the only country with a record 3-consecutive and 7-total Continental Football Competition winner. As of 2021, Egypt's national team is ranked #46 in the world by FIFA.\nCairo failed at the applicant stage when bidding for the 2008 Summer Olympics, which was hosted in Beijing. However, Cairo did host the 2007 Pan Arab Games.\nThere are other sports teams in the city that participate in several sports including Gezira Sporting Club, el Shams Club, Shooting Club, Heliopolis Sporting Club, and several smaller clubs. There are new sports clubs in the area of New Cairo (one hour far from Cairo's downtown), these are Al Zohour sporting club, Wadi Degla sporting club and Platinum Club.\nMost of the sports federations of the country are located in the city suburbs, including the Egyptian Football Association. The headquarters of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) was previously located in Cairo, before relocating to its new headquarters in 6 October City, a small city away from Cairo's crowded districts. In 2008, the Egyptian Rugby Federation was officially formed and granted membership into the International Rugby Board.\nEgypt is internationally known for the excellence of its squash players who excel in professional and junior divisions. Egypt has seven players in the top ten of the PSA men's world rankings, and three in the women's top ten. Mohamed El Shorbagy held the world number one position for more than a year. Nour El Sherbini has won the Women's World Championship twice and has been the women's world number one. On 30 April 2016, she became the youngest woman to win the Women's World Championship. In 2017 she retained her title.\nCairo is the official endpoint of Cross Egypt Challenge where its route ends yearly in the most sacred place in Egypt, under the Great Pyramids of Giza with a huge trophy-giving ceremony.\n\nCityscape and landmarks\nTahrir Square\nTahrir Square was founded during the mid 19th century with the establishment of modern downtown Cairo. It was first named Ismailia Square, after the 19th-century ruler Khedive Ismail, who commissioned the new downtown district's 'Paris on the Nile' design. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1919 the square became widely known as Tahrir (Liberation) Square, though it was not officially renamed as such until after the 1952 Revolution which eliminated the monarchy. Several notable buildings surround the square including, the American University in Cairo's downtown campus, the Mogamma governmental administrative Building, the headquarters of the Arab League, the Nile Ritz Carlton Hotel, and the Egyptian Museum. Being at the heart of Cairo, the square has witnessed several major protests over the years. However, the most notable event in the square was being the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution against former president Hosni Mubarak. In 2020 the government completed the erection of a new monument in the center of the square featuring an ancient obelisk from the reign of Ramses II, originally unearthed at Tanis (San al-Hagar) in 2019, and four ram-headed sphinx statues moved from Karnak.\n\nEgyptian Museum\nThe Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, known commonly as the Egyptian Museum, is home to the most extensive collection of ancient Egyptian antiquities in the world. It has 136,000 items on display, with many more hundreds of thousands in its basement storerooms. Among the collections on display are the finds from the tomb of Tutankhamun.\n\nGrand Egyptian Museum\nMuch of the collection of the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, including the Tutankhamun collection, are slated to be moved to the new Grand Egyptian Museum, under construction in Giza and was due to open by the end of 2020.\n\nCairo Tower\nThe Cairo Tower is a free-standing tower with a revolving restaurant at the top. It is one of Cairo's landmarks and provides a bird's eye view of the city to restaurant patrons. It stands in the Zamalek district on Gezira Island on the Nile River, in the city centre. At 187 m (614 ft), it is 44 m (144 ft) higher than the Great Pyramid of Giza, which stands some 15 km (9 mi) to the southwest.\n\nOld Cairo\nThis area of Cairo is so-named as it contains the remains of the ancient Roman fortress of Babylon and also overlaps the original site of Fustat, the first Arab settlement in Egypt (7th century AD) and the predecessor of later Cairo. The area includes Coptic Cairo, which holds a high concentration of old Christian churches such as the Hanging Church, the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, and other Christian or Coptic buildings, most of which are located in an enclave on the site of the ancient Roman fortress. It is also the location of the Coptic Museum, which showcases the history of Coptic art from Greco-Roman to Islamic times, and of the Ben Ezra Synagogue, the oldest and best-known synagogue in Cairo, where the important collection of Geniza documents were discovered in the 19th century.\n\nTo the north of this Coptic enclave is the Amr ibn al-'As Mosque, the first mosque in Egypt and the most important religious centre of what was formerly Fustat, founded in 642 AD right after the Arab conquest but rebuilt many times since. A part of the former city of Fustat has also been excavated to the east of the mosque and of the Coptic enclave, although the archeological site is threatened by encroaching construction and modern development. To the northwest of Babylon Fortress and the mosque is the Monastery of Saint Mercurius (or Dayr Abu Sayfayn), an important and historic Coptic religious complex consisting of the Church of Saint Mercurius, the Church of Saint Shenute, and the Church of the Virgin (also known as al-Damshiriya). Several other historic churches are also situated to the south of Babylon Fortress.\n\nIslamic Cairo\nCairo holds one of the greatest concentrations of historical monuments of Islamic architecture in the world. The areas around the old walled city and around the Citadel are characterised by hundreds of mosques, tombs, madrasas, mansions, caravanserais, and fortifications dating from the Islamic era and are often referred to as \"Islamic Cairo\", especially in English travel literature. It is also the location of several important religious shrines such as the al-Hussein Mosque (whose shrine is believed to hold the head of Husayn ibn Ali), the Mausoleum of Imam al-Shafi'i (founder of the Shafi'i madhhab, one of the primary schools of thought in Sunni Islamic jurisprudence), the Tomb of Sayyida Ruqayya, the Mosque of Sayyida Nafisa, and others.\nThe first mosque in Egypt was the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in what was formerly Fustat, the first Arab-Muslim settlement in the area. However, the Mosque of Ibn Tulun is the oldest mosque that still retains its original form and is a rare example of Abbasid architecture from the classical period of Islamic civilisation. It was built in 876–879 AD in a style inspired by the Abbasid capital of Samarra in Iraq. It is one of the largest mosques in Cairo and is often cited as one of the most beautiful. Another Abbasid construction, the Nilometer on Roda Island, is the oldest original structure in Cairo, built in 862 AD. It was designed to measure the level of the Nile, which was important for agricultural and administrative purposes.\nThe settlement that was formally named Cairo (Arabic: al-Qahira) was founded to the northeast of Fustat in 959 AD by the victorious Fatimid army. The Fatimids built it as a separate palatial city which contained their palaces and institutions of government. It was enclosed by a circuit of walls, which were rebuilt in stone in the late 11th century AD by the vizier Badr al-Gamali, parts of which survive today at Bab Zuwayla in the south and Bab al-Futuh and Bab al-Nasr in the north. Among the extant monuments from the Fatimid era are the large Mosque of al-Hakim, the Aqmar Mosque, Juyushi Mosque, Lulua Mosque, and the Mosque of Al-Salih Tala'i.\nOne of the most important and lasting institutions founded in the Fatimid period was the Mosque of al-Azhar, founded in 970 AD, which competes with the al-Qarawiyyin in Fes for the title of oldest university in the world. Today, al-Azhar University is the foremost Center of Islamic learning in the world and one of Egypt's largest universities with campuses across the country. The mosque itself retains significant Fatimid elements but has been added to and expanded in subsequent centuries, notably by the Mamluk sultans Qaytbay and al-Ghuri and by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda in the 18th century.\nThe most prominent architectural heritage of medieval Cairo, however, dates from the Mamluk period, from 1250 to 1517 AD. The Mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life, commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque, madrasa, khanqah (for Sufis), a sabil (water dispensary), and a mausoleum for themselves and their families. Among the best-known examples of Mamluk monuments in Cairo are the huge Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan, the Mosque of Amir al-Maridani, the Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad (whose twin minarets were built above the gate of Bab Zuwayla), the Sultan Al-Ghuri complex, the funerary complex of Sultan Qaytbay in the Northern Cemetery, and the trio of monuments in the Bayn al-Qasrayn area comprising the complex of Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun, the Madrasa of al-Nasir Muhammad, and the Madrasa of Sultan Barquq. Some mosques include spolia (often columns or capitals) from earlier buildings built by the Romans, Byzantines, or Copts.\nThe Mamluks, and the later Ottomans, also built wikalas or caravanserais to house merchants and goods due to the important role of trade and commerce in Cairo's economy. Still intact today is the Wikala al-Ghuri, which today hosts regular performances by the Al-Tannoura Egyptian Heritage Dance Troupe. The Khan al-Khalili is a commercial hub which also integrated caravanserais (also known as khans).\n\nCitadel of Cairo\nThe Citadel is a fortified enclosure begun by Salah al-Din in 1176 AD on an outcrop of the Muqattam Hills as part of a large defensive system to protect both Cairo to the north and Fustat to the southwest. It was the centre of Egyptian government and residence of its rulers until 1874, when Khedive Isma'il moved to 'Abdin Palace. It is still occupied by the military today, but is now open as a tourist attraction comprising, notably, the National Military Museum, the 14th century Mosque of al-Nasir Muhammad, and the 19th century Mosque of Muhammad Ali which commands a dominant position on Cairo's skyline.\n\nKhan el-Khalili\nKhan el-Khalili is an ancient bazaar, or marketplace adjacent to the Al-Hussein Mosque. It dates back to 1385, when Amir Jarkas el-Khalili built a large caravanserai, or khan. (A caravanserai is a hotel for traders, and usually the focal point for any surrounding area.) This original caravanserai building was demolished by Sultan al-Ghuri, who rebuilt it as a new commercial complex in the early 16th century, forming the basis for the network of souqs existing today. Many medieval elements remain today, including the ornate Mamluk-style gateways. Today, Khan el-Khalili is a major tourist attraction and popular stop for tour groups.\n\nSociety\nIn the present day, Cairo is a heavily urbanised city. Because of the influx of people into the city, lone standing houses are rare, and apartment buildings accommodate for the limited space and abundance of people. Single detached houses are usually owned by the wealthy. Formal education is also seen as important, with twelve years of standard formal education. Cairenes can take a standardised test similar to the SAT to be accepted to an institution of higher learning, but most children do not finish school and opt to pick up a trade to enter the workforce. Egypt still struggles with poverty, with almost half the population living on $2 or less a day.\n\nWomen's rights\nThe civil rights movement for women in Cairo – and by extent, Egypt – has been a struggle for years. Women are reported to face constant discrimination, sexual harassment, and abuse throughout Cairo. A 2013 UN study found that over 99% of Egyptian women reported experiencing sexual harassment at some point in their lives. The problem has persisted in spite of new national laws since 2014 defining and criminalising sexual harassment. The situation is so severe that in 2017, Cairo was named by one poll as the most dangerous megacity for women in the world. In 2020, the social media account \"Assault Police\" began to name and shame perpetrators of violence against women, in an effort to dissuade potential offenders. The account was founded by student Nadeen Ashraf, who is credited for instigating an iteration of the #MeToo movement in Egypt.\n\nPollution\nThe air pollution in Cairo is a matter of serious concern. Greater Cairo's volatile aromatic hydrocarbon levels are higher than many other similar cities. Air quality measurements in Cairo have also been recording dangerous levels of lead, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and suspended particulate matter concentrations due to decades of unregulated vehicle emissions, urban industrial operations, and chaff and trash burning. There are over 4,500,000 cars on the streets of Cairo, 60% of which are over 10 years old, and therefore lack modern emission cutting features. Cairo has a very poor dispersion factor because of its lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets, which create a bowl effect.\nIn recent years, a black cloud (as Egyptians refer to it) of smog  has appeared over Cairo every autumn due to temperature inversion. Smog causes serious respiratory diseases and eye irritations for the city's citizens. Tourists who are not familiar with such high levels of pollution must take extra care.\nCairo also has many unregistered lead and copper smelters which heavily pollute the city. The results of this has been a permanent haze over the city with particulate matter in the air reaching over three times normal levels. It is estimated that 10,000 to 25,000 people a year in Cairo die due to air pollution-related diseases. Lead has been shown to cause harm to the central nervous system and neurotoxicity particularly in children. In 1995, the first environmental acts were introduced and the situation has seen some improvement with 36 air monitoring stations and emissions tests on cars. Twenty thousand buses have also been commissioned to the city to improve congestion levels, which are very high.\nThe city also suffers from a high level of land pollution. Cairo produces 10,000 tons of waste material each day, 4,000 tons of which are not collected or managed. This is a huge health hazard, and the Egyptian Government is looking for ways to combat this. The Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Agency was founded to collect and recycle the waste; they work with the Zabbaleen community that has been collecting and recycling Cairo's waste since the turn of the 20th century and live in an area known locally as Manshiyat Naser. Both are working together to pick up as much waste as possible within the city limits, though it remains a pressing problem.\n\nInternational relations\nThe Headquarters of the Arab League is located at Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nCairo is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nZulfikar family, Egyptian noble family\nRabab Al-Kadhimi (1918–1998), dentist and poet\nWael Alaa (born 1987), musician known as Neobyrd\nAmr Aly (born 1962), American soccer player and Olympian\nGamal Aziz, also known as Gamal Mohammed Abdelaziz, former president and chief operating officer of Wynn Resorts, and former CEO of MGM Resorts International, indicted as part of the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal\nYasser Arafat (1929–2004), born Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf al-Qudwa al-Husseini, was the 3rd Chairman of The PLO and first president of the Palestinian Authority\nAbu Sa'id al-Afif, 15th-century Samaritan\nEzz El-Dine Zulficar (1919–1963), Egyptian film director, screenwriter, actor and producer, known for his distinctive style, which blends romance and action.

          "summary": "Cairo is the capital and largest city of Egypt and the Cairo Governorate, being home to more than 10 million people. It is also part of the largest urban agglomeration in Africa, the Arab world, and the Middle East. The Greater Cairo metropolitan area is one of the largest in the world by population with over 22 million people.\nThe area that would become Cairo was part of ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex and the ancient cities of Memphis and Heliopolis are near-by. Located near the Nile Delta, the predecessor settlement was Fustat following the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 next to an existing ancient Roman fortress, Babylon. Subsequently, Cairo was founded by the Fatimid dynasty in 969. It later superseded Fustat as the main urban centre during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods (12th–16th centuries).\nCairo has since become a longstanding centre of political and cultural life, and is titled \"the city of a thousand minarets\" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture. Cairo's historic center was awarded World Heritage Site status in 1979. Cairo is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification according to GaWC. The city is also a center of finance and commerce, academics and the arts, and is home to Cairo Symphony Orchestra and the Cairo Opera House, while the Academy of Arts provides visual arts education. Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industry in the Arab world, as well as Egypt's oldest institution of higher learning, Al-Azhar University. Many international media, businesses, and organisations have regional headquarters in Cairo. The Arab League has had its headquarters in Cairo for most of its existence.\nCairo, like many other megacities, suffers from high levels of pollution and traffic. The Cairo Metro, opened in 1987, is the oldest metro system in Africa, and ranks amongst the fifteen busiest in the world, with over 1 billion annual passenger rides. The economy of Cairo was ranked first in the Middle East in 2005, and 43rd globally on Foreign Policy's 2010 Global Cities Index.",

          "content": "القَاهِرَه هي عاصمه جمهوريه مصر العربيه واكبر واهم مدنها، وتعد اكبر مدينه عربيه من حيث تعداد السكان والمساحه، وتحتل المركز الثاني افريقيًا والسابع عشر عالميًا من حيث التعداد السكاني، كما انها جزء من اكبر تجمع حضري في افريقيا والوطن العربي والشرق الاوسط. تعد منطقه القاهره الكبرى الثانيه عشره من حيث عدد السكان في العالم حيث يبلغ عدد سكانها 21,322,750 مليون نسمه حسب احصائيات عام 2021. يمثلون 20% من اجمالي تعداد سكان مصر اكثر من (107 مليون نسمه).\nتعد مدينه القاهره من اكثر المدن تنوعاً ثقافياً وحضارياً، حيث شهدت العديد من الحقب التاريخيه المختلفه على مر العصور، وتوجد فيها العديد من المعالم القديمه والحديثه، فاصبحت متحفاً مفتوحاً يضم اثاراً فرعونيه ويونانيه ورومانيه وقبطيه واسلاميه. يعود تاريخ المدينه الى نشاه مدينه اون الفرعونيه او هليوبوليس «عين شمس حالياً» والتي تعد واحده من اقدم مدن العالم القديم. اما القاهره بطرازها الحالي فيعود تاريخ انشائها الى الفتح الاسلامي لمصر على يد عمرو بن العاص عام 641 م وانشائه مدينه الفسطاط، ثم انشاء العباسيين لمدينه العسكر، فبناء احمد بن طولون لمدينه القطائع، ومع دخول الفاطميين مصر قادمين من افريقيه (تونس حالياً) بدا القائد جوهر الصقلي في بناء العاصمه الجديده للدوله الفاطميه بامر من الخليفه الفاطمي المعز لدين الله وذلك في عام 969م، واطلق عليها الخليفه اسم «القاهره». واطلق على القاهره- على مر العصور- العديد من الاسماء، فهي مدينه الالف مئذنه ومصر المحروسه وقاهره المعز. شهدت القاهره خلال العصر الاسلامي ارقى فنون العماره التي تمثلت في بناء القلاع والحصون والاسوار والمدارس والمساجد، مما منحها لمحهً جماليهً لا زالت موجوده باحيائها القديمه حتى الان.\nوتعد القاهره محافظه ومدينه، اي انها محافظه تشغل كامل مساحتها مدينه واحده، وفي نفس الوقت مدينه كبيره تشكل محافظه بذاتها، وتنقسم الى 37 حياً، وتحتفل القاهره بعيدها القومي في 6 يوليو من كل عام، وهو اليوم الذي يوافق وضع القائد جوهر الصقلي حجر اساس المدينه عام 969م، ليبلغ عمر القاهره الان ما يربو على 1055 عام.\nتعد القاهره ايضاً مقراً للعديد من المنظمات الاقليميه والعالميه، حيث يقع بها مقر جامعه الدول العربيه، والمكتب الاقليمي لكل من: منظمه الصحه العالميه، منظمه الاغذيه والزراعه، منظمه الطيران المدني الدولي، الاتحاد الدولي للاتصالات، صندوق الامم المتحده للسكان، هيئه الامم المتحده للمراه، مقر برنامج الامم المتحده الانمائي، مكتب تنسيق الشؤون الانسانيه للامم المتحده، وكذلك مقر الاتحاد الافريقي لكره السله.\n\nالتسميه\nاختلفت الاقاويل حول سبب تسميه القاهره بهذا الاسم، فقيل ان جوهر الصقلي سمى المدينه في اول الامر المنصوريه تيمناً باسم مدينه المنصوريه التي انشاها خارج القيروان المنصور بالله والد المعز لدين الله، او تيمناً باسم والد المعز نفسه احياءً لذكراه، واستمر هذا الاسم حتى قدم المعز الى مصر فاطلق عليها اسم «القاهره»، وذلك بعد مرور اربع سنوات على تاسيسها، تفاؤلاً بانها ستقهر الدوله العباسيه المنافسه للفاطميين، وقيل انه سماها بالقاهره لتقهر الدنيا، او انها سميت نسبه الى الكوكب القاهر وهو كوكب المريخ. ولمدينه القاهره عده اسماء شهيره منها مصر المحروسه، قاهره المعز، مدينه الالف مئذنه، جوهره الشرق.\n\nالتاريخ\nاكتسبت القاهره مكانتها وتاثيرها على مختلف الحضارات بفضل موقعها الاستراتيجي الذي اختاره لها اهل مصر منذ فجر الحضاره، وتميزت عن بقيه العواصم التاريخيه بصفه الاستمرار، فشكل تطورها سلسله من الحلقات بدات مع مدينه اون في عهد ما قبل الاسرات والتي كانت بمثابه العاصمه الدينيه بعد توحيد البلاد وبدايه عهد الاسرات على يد الملك مينا بينما كانت منف هي اول عاصمه اداريه وسياسيه لمصر بعد استقرار الوحده. وعرفت اون فيما بعد بالاسم الاغريقي هليوبوليس او عين شمس حالياً. عقب الفتح الاسلامي لمصر سنه 18 هـ/639 م، شيد عمرو بن العاص مدينه الفسطاط سنه 21 هـ/641 م، وبنى جامع عرف باسمه، ثم اختطت اماكن اقامه القبائل العربيه. وعقب قيام الدوله العباسيه والقضاء على الدوله الامويه انشا العباسيون مدينه العسكر في مكان عرف باسم الحمراء القصوى يقع شمال شرق الفسطاط واقاموا فيه دورهم ومساكنهم، وشيد فيها صالح بن علي دار الاماره وثكن الجند، ثم شيد الفضل بن صالح مسجد العسكر، وبمرور الايام اتصلت العسكر بالفسطاط واصبحتا مدينه كبيره خطت فيها الطرق وشيدت بها المساجد والاسواق. وذلك الى ان تولى احمد بن طولون حكم مصر وراى ان مدينه العسكر لا تتسع لحاشيته وجنده، فصعد الى جبل المقطم وراى بين العسكر والمقطم ارض فضاء فاختط في موضعها مدينته الجديده التي سميت القطائع. وبعد قرابه مائه عام على انشاء القطائع دخل الفاطميون مصر بقياده جوهر الصقلي موفداً من الخليفه المعز لدين الله، فاخذ في وضع اساس «القاهره» شمال شرقي القطائع، كما وضع اساس القصر الفاطمي الكبير، وشرع بجانبه في بناء الجامع الازهر.\n\nالعصور القديمه\nاون\nكانت مدينه اون القديمه وموقعها حالياً منطقه المطريه وعين شمس من ابرز مراكز الثقافه المصريه القديمه وذكرت في المتون المصريه القديمه باسماء «اونو افق السماء» و«انو سماء مصر» واعتبرتها مقر الالهه المختاره وموطن ميلاد كل معبود، وسميت المدينه في القبطيه «اونو»، وفي اليونانيه «هليوبوليس» بمعنى مدينه الشمس. كان للمدينه ماضيها السياسي حيث تعد واحده من اقدم عواصم مصر المتحده في فجر التاريخ وذلك نتيجه لجهود زعمائها الذين اقاموا بها اول وحده للوجهين سبقت الوحده التي تمت على يد الملك مينا. وكفل للمدينه شهرتها في الفلسفه والدين قدم مذهبها في تفسير نشاه الوجود. اما في الفلك ترجع شهره المدينه الى ابتكار التقويم الشمسي الذي تميزت به الحضاره المصريه. وعلى الرغم من ان مدينه اون لم تلعب دوراً سياسياً بارزاً في العصور التاريخيه الا انها ظلت محتفظه بمكانتها الثقافيه والحضاريه والدينيه وحرص الملوك على ترك اثارهم بها على مر العصور، واسفرت الحفائر الحديثه عن الكثير من الاثار التي تدل على ذلك منها الجزء العلوي لمسله صغيره من الحجر الرملي تعود الى عهد الملك تتي من الدوله القديمه. ومن اثار عصر الدوله الوسطى، مسله من الجرانيت الاحمر اقامها الملك سنوسرت الاول، وبقايا مسله للفرعون تحتمس الثالث، وعدد من اللوحات من الحجر الجيري وجزء من تمثال اثري. ومن اثار عصر الدوله الحديثه، عمود مرنبتاج الموجود في منطقه المعابد، وتمثال الملك سيتي الثاني من الحجر الجيري، وبقايا معبد للملك رمسيس الثالث، وعدد من تيجان الاعمده واجزاء من اعمده وتماثيل لابو الهول.\n\nبابليون\nتقع مدينه بابليون في منطقه القاهره القبطيه حالياً، وقام بانشائها رمسيس الثاني واتخذت اسمها من اسرى البابليين الذين ثاروا عليه، فبنى بها القلعه التي اعتقلهم فيها، ثم اطلق الاسم على المدينه باكملها. واشتهرت المدينه في العصر الروماني في عهد الامبراطور اغسطس، وامر باعاده بنائها الامبراطور تراجان عام 130 ق.م وحول الحصن الى مدينه عسكريه، ورمم الحصن ووسعه الامبراطور الروماني اركاديوس في القرن الرابع الميلادي. استعمل في بناء الحصن احجار اخذت من معابد فرعونيه واكملت بالطوب الاحمر ولم يبق من مباني الحصن حالياً سوى الباب القبلي الذي يكتنفه برجان كبيران، وبنى فوق احد البرجين الكنيسه المعلقه، كما بني فوق البرج الاخر كنيسه مار جرجس الروماني للروم الارثوذكس، وعلى باقي السور بنيت كنيسه القديس ابو سرجه وكنيسه العذراء وقصريه الريحان ودير مار جرجس للراهبات وكنيسه القديسه برباره ومعبد لليهود. يعرف الحصن الروماني بقصر الشمع او قلعه بابليون وتبلغ مساحته حوالي نصف كيلومتر مربع، ويقع بداخله المتحف القبطي. في عام 641 م سقط الحصن في يد عمرو بن العاص بعد حصار دام نحو سبعه اشهر في 18 ربيع الاخر 20 هـ/16 ابريل 641 م، وكان سقوطه ايذاناً بدخول الاسلام في مصر. اختار عمرو بن العاص مكان استراتيجي شمال حصن بابليون واقام فيه مدينه الفسطاط وداخلها حصن بابليون لتكون مدينه للجند العرب.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nالفسطاط\nاتخذت الفسطاط اسمها من خيمه عمرو بن العاص التي اقامها في وسط معسكره، وانشاها عمرو بن العاص شمال حصن بابليون، وامر بتخطيطها لتكون اول عاصمه للاسلام في مصر بدلاً من الاسكندريه، وفي وسط المدينه اقام مسجداً للصلاه سمي باسمه واشتهر بمناراته الاربعه، وخططت الارض حوله الى احياء، وولى عمرو بن العاص اربعه من المسلمين لتنظيم المدينه وهم معاويه بن خديج التجيبي، شريك بن سمي الغطيفي، عمرو بن محزم الخولاني، جبريل بن ناشره المعافري. اشتهرت الفسطاط بشوارعها المرصوفه ومنازلها الفسيحه التي تتوسطها نافورات المياه والحدائق الداخليه، وتعددت بالمدينه الاسواق التي كان يقع معظمها على شاطئ نهر النيل وذلك بخلاف الاسواق حول الجامع. تميز اختيار موقع المدينه بسهوله الدفاع عنه لاسباب طبيعيه فالنيل يحدها من الغرب وجبل المقطم من الشرق واللذان شكلا حاجزا طبيعياً ضد اي اعتداء خارجي.\n\nالعسكر\nالعسكر هي ثاني العواصم الاسلاميه في مصر، وانشاها العباسيون في مكان عرف باسم الحمراء القصوى يقع شمال شرق الفسطاط، واقاموا فيه دورهم ومساكنهم، وشيد فيه صالح بن علي دار الاماره وثكنات الجند او دار العسكر، ومنه اتخذت المدينه اسمها، ثم شيد الفضل بن صالح مسجد العسكر. تعتبر المدينه امتداداً للاتجاهات التخطيطيه والعمرانيه لمدينه الفسطاط، وعظمت بها العماره وشيدت المساكن والقصور وتوسع عمرانها حتى التحمت بالفسطاط، وحكم مصر منها 65 والياً على امتداد 120 عاماً، ويرجح ان موقعها كان بالقرب من حي السيده زينب حالياً.\n\nالقطائع\nالقطائع هي المدينه التي اسسها احمد بن طولون، لتصبح بذلك ثالث عاصمه اسلاميه في مصر، ويرجع اسمها الى نظام تخطيطها المنقول عن مدينه سامراء التي شب فيها بن طولون، وهو التخطيط المتقاطع المكون من قطع سكنيه كل منها لجماعه من السكان تربطهم رابطه او طبقه او مستوى واحد، يطلق عليها اسم القطع. شيدت المدينه في الارض الفضاء بين مدينه العسكر وجبل المقطم، ووضعت اولى خططها عام 256 هـ/870 م، وبعد ست سنوات في عام 876 م احتفل ابن طولون بوضع اساس الجامع الذي سمي باسمه على جبل يشكر، والذي انتهى بناؤه في سنتين، ويقع في وسط المدينه، ويعد من اكبر مساجد العالم الاسلامي بمساحه تبلغ 26500 متر مربع، واشتهر باسم الجامع المعلق اذ يصعد الى ابوابه بسلالم دائريه الشكل، كما انشا ابن طولون اول مستشفى في مصر بمنطقه البساتين. وانتقل الى المدينه كل من له صله بالحكم او اداره البلاد وافراد الجيش، ولم يكن مسموحاً للعامه بالسكن فيها. ظلت القطائع عاصمه مصر خلال الحكم الطولوني الذي استمر 27 عاماً حتى سنه 293 هـ/905 م، مع قدوم الجيش العباسي الى مصر، والذي محى القطائع وحولها الى اطلال مع الابقاء على الجامع، وعادت مدينه العسكر مقراً للحكم حتى دخول الفاطميين.\n\nقاهره المعز\nبعد قرابه المائه عام على انشاء القطائع، قدم الى مصر جيش الفاطميين من المغرب بقياده جوهر الصقلي موفداً من الخليفه المعز لدين الله، ووصل الى الفسطاط في 11 شعبان 358 هـ/يوليو 969 م، ودخلها في اليوم التالي، ونزل مع جنوده في الفراغ الواقع شمال شرقي القطائع واخذ في وضع اساس القاعده الفاطميه الجديده في 17 شعبان 385 هـ/7 يوليو 969 م، والتي سماها «القاهره»، كما وضع اساس القصر الفاطمي الكبير في 18 شعبان 358 هـ، وشرع بجانبه في بناء الجامع الازهر في جمادي الاول سنه 359 هـ/ابريل 970 م. انشئت المدينه على مساحه 340 فدان، وبني حولها سور من اللبن مربع الشكل طول كل من ضلعيه الشمالي والجنوبي 1500 ذراع، وضلعيه الشرقي والغربي 1700 ذراع، وبكل ضلع من اضلاع السور بوابتان، فالضلع الشمالي به باب النصر وباب الفتوح، والشرقي به باب البرقيه (الغريب) والقراطين (المحروق)، والجنوبي يواجه الفسطاط عند باب الخلق وبه باب زويله (المتولي) وباب الفرج، والغربي به باب القنطره وباب سعاده. بدات المدينه كمدينه عسكريه تشتمل على مساكن الامراء ودواوين الحكومه وخزائن المال، وفي سنه 973 تحولت الى عاصمه الدوله الفاطميه عندما انتقل اليها المعز لدين الله من المغرب، واطلق عليها قاهره المعز. بعد انقضاء 120 سنه من تاسيس القاهره راى امير الجيوش بدر الجمالي وكان وزيراً للخليفه المستنصر بالله ان الناس شيدوا خارج سور القاهره بسبب اتساع العمران، فاحاطها بسور وصله بسور جوهر عام 480 هـ/1087 م، واقام السور الجديد من اللبن والابواب من الحجاره.\n\nالعصر الايوبي\nارسل السلطان نور الدين محمود حمله الى مصر لطرد الصليبيين بقياده اسد الدين شيركوه، الذي اصطحب معه صلاح الدين ابن اخيه نجم الدين ايوب. وعقب وفاه شيركوه ولي الخليفه العاضد صلاح الدين وزاره مصر، فاصبح بذلك الرجل الاول في الدوله. ثم استبد صلاح الدين بالامور وضعف امر العاضد وهدم دار المعرفه وبناها مدرسه شافعيه وبنى دار الغزل للمالكيه وعزل قضاه الشيعه واقام قاضياً شافعياً في مصر واستناب في جميع البلاد. وبدلاً من ان ينشئ صلاح الدين عاصمه جديده، اتجه الى ضم ضواحي المدينه الاربعه (الفسطاط والعسكر والقطائع والقاهره الفاطميه) لتكون معاً عاصمه الدوله، فخرجت القاهره عن نطاق اسوارها القديمه وامتد تخطيطها ليصل الى قلعه الجبل، التي ظلت مقراً لحكم مصر في مختلف العصور التي تلت حكم الايوبيين، وحتى عصر الخديوي اسماعيل الذي نقل مقر الحكم الى قصر عابدين. وفي عام 569 هـ انتدب بهاء الدين قراقوش لمد سور حول القاهره بحدودها الجديده، فزاد في سور القاهره الممتد من باب القتطره الى باب الشعريه، ومن باب الشعريه الى باب البحر، ثم زاد في الجزء الذي يلي باب النصر الى برج الظفر ومن هذا البرج الى برج البرقيه ومنه الى درب بطوط والى خارج باب الوزير ليتصل بسور قلعه الجبل. ومن معالم تلك الحقبه التي ما زالت باقيه، سواقي عيون بئر يوسف وقناطر مجرى المياه التي تحمل المياه الى القلعه.\n\nالعصر المملوكي\nيعد عصر المماليك هو العصر الذهبي للقاهره، ولا سيما بعدما خفت وطاه الحروب الصليبيه في الشام، وانتصر المماليك على المغول. ففي عهد الظاهر بيبرس امتدت القاهره في اتجاه الشمال خارج اسوارها في حي الحسينيه، وشيد مسجداً رائعاً يعرف اليوم باسم جامع الظاهر وكان اسمه قديماً جامع الصافيه، كما شيد العديد من المباني في قلعه صلاح الدين كدار الذهب، وانشا الاسواق والجسور والقناطر، وشاركه امراؤه في بناء العديد من العمائر والرباع والخانات والدور والمساجد والحمامات التي اضافت لمسه من الجلال والجمال على المدينه.\n\n وفي عهد اسره قلاوون التي حكمت مصر قرابه المائه عام، شيد المنصور قلاوون طائفه من العمائر النادره، منها مدرسه الجليله وقبته او ضريحه، وانشا المارستان وجعله وقفاً لجميع الطوائف من الملك حتى العبيد، وما زال جزء منه قائماً الى اليوم. وفي ايام السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون، امتدت القاهره جهه الشمال عبر الصحراء والشمال الغربي والغرب ايضاً بما طرحه النيل من طمي اثمر تدريجياً عن ارض جديده غرب القاهره، فلم يترك امراء المماليك قطعه ارض داخل القاهره الا واقاموا فيها المساجد والمدارس والحمامات والسبل والوكالات والاضرحه، فعم الرخاء على المدينه وازدهرت التجاره وتسابق الامراء والاعيان على تشييد ابهى فنون العماره. واحب السلطان الناصر العماره فرصع القاهره بافخم المباني، وانشا تحت قلعه صلاح الدين ميداناً للالعاب والمسابقات بين الامراء، وعمر كثيراً من القصور داخل القلعه، وشيد جامعه ذا المئذنتين الذي ما زال قائماً حتى الان، وفي ايامه زار مصر الرحاله المسلم ابن بطوطه في عام 1326 فقال عنها «قهرت قاهرتها الامم، وتملكت ملوكها نواصي العرب والعجم»، وفي اثناء حكم المماليك البحريه ولد المؤرخ تقي الدين المقريزي، الذي الف موسوعه هامه عن خطط مصر وعن القاهره بوجه خاص وصفت جمال عماره القاهره وفنونها. وفي ايام السلطان حسن بن قلاوون شيدت عماره جليله تمثلت في مدرسه ومسجد السلطان حسن، الذي يعد اجمل مساجد القاهره. وفي عهد المماليك الجراكسه ظهر حبهم للعمائر الجميله والذوق السليم، فشيد سلاطينهم وامراؤهم العمائر والمساجد ومنها مسجد الملك الظاهر برقوق بجوار مدرسه الناصر قلاوون، وخانقاه الملك الناصر بن برقوق، وهي بناء ضخم صمم ليخدم عده اغراض، فهو ضريح لال برقوق ومدرسه للعلوم ومسجد وخانقاه فخمه، ومسجد الملك المؤيد شيخ بجوار باب زويله، ومسجد السلطان الاشرف برسباي، ومسجد السلطان الاشرف قايتباي، ومسجد السلطان قنصوه الغوري.\n\nالعصر العثماني\nاستولى السلطان سليم على مصر وشرع في تاييد سلطته، فجعل عليها حاكماً يلقب بالباشا، وليضمن عدم خروج الباشا على الاستانه ويستقل بمصر، جعل في مصر ثلاث ادارات كل منها يراقب الاخر، حتى لا يخشى من اتحادها او تمردها، فكانت القوه الاولى هي «الباشا» واهم واجباته هي ابلاغ الاوامر السلطانيه لرجال الحكومه والشعب ومراقبه تنفيذها، والقوه الثانيه هي «الوجاقات الست» وواجبها هو حفظ النظام والدفاع عن القطر المصري، وتوزعت في القاهره والمراكز الرئيسيه، اما القوه الثالثه فهي «المماليك» وهم بقايا المماليك البحريه والجراكسه، وواجبهم حفظ التوازن بين الباشا والوجاقات لانهم اعداء لكلا الفريقين. وظل امراء المماليك هم اصحاب القوه الفعليه بالبلاد، وزاد نفوذهم مع تقلص نفوذ الباب العالي وتقلص نفوذ ولاته في مصر. ومن اثار تلك الحقبه التي ما زالت باقيه مسجد محمد بك ابو الذهب تجاه الجامع الازهر، وعمائر عبد الرحمن كتخدا «محافظ مصر»، والذي كان مغرماً بالبناء فانشا وجدد الكثير من المساجد والسبل والاضرحه، وكان في مقدمه الساعين لتجميل القاهره، ويتجلى ذلك في سبيله الرائع الواقع في ملتقى شارعي النحاسيين والجماليه والمعروف باسمه حتى اليوم، كما انشا بالقرب من باب الفتوح مسجداً وكتاباً، وزاد في مقصوره الجامع الازهر وبنى به محراباً جديداً واقام له منبراً وانشا له باباً عظيماً وبنى باعلاه مكتباً لتعليم الايتام من اطفال المسلمين، وبنى المدرسه الطيبرسيه، وانشا عند باب البرقيه «باب الغريب» جامعاً ومكتباً، وجامعاً ومكتباً وساقيه ومناره جهه الازبكيه، كما بنى المشهد الحسيني، ومشاهد السيده زينب والسيده سكينه والسيده عائشه والسيده فاطمه والسيده رقيه، وجدد المارستان المنصوري، وكانت دار سكناه بحاره عابدين من الدور العظيمه المحكمه الوضع والاتقان.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nعصر الاسره العلويه\nاسس محمد علي الاسره العلويه في مصر وارسى خلال حكمه اسس النهضه الحديثه، وانتقل بمصر من الاضمحلال الذي سيطر عليها خلال حكم العثمانيين الى مشارف العصر الحديث، وارتقى بها الى رتب الدول المتقدمه. ادرك محمد علي بعبقريته الفطريه الفذه ان السبيل لبناء النهضه هو الارتقاء بالعلوم والاداره والصناعه والزراعه، فانشا المدارس الحديثه وارسل البعثات العلميه واعاد تنظيم الجيش والاداره الحكوميه وشيد دور الصناعه بانواعها والتي تركزت بمنطقه السبتيه، كما اقام الجسور والقناطر وحفر الترع. واهتم محمد علي بالقاهره فامر بتنظيم وتوسيع وتنظيف واناره شوارعها، وازال الانقاض المحيطه بها وردم بها بركها، وكون في عام 1834 مجلساً للاشراف على تجميل القاهره، كما استقدم الفنانين والعمال المهره من فرنسا وايطاليا وتركيا لبناء القصور واشترط عليهم تعيين اربعه من المصريين مع كل منهم ليتعلموا حرفتهم، ومن اشهر القصور التي شيدها قصر الجوهره وقصر القبه وقصر الحرم وقصر الازبكيه وقصر النيل، وقام ايضاً ببناء جامعه بالقلعه، والذي تم تصميمه على غرار مسجد السلطان احمد بالاستانه. وفي ابريل 1847 انتقلت ولايه مصر من محمد علي الى ابراهيم باشا، والذي اهتم بتقويه الجيش والاسطول ونظم جمعيه الحقانيه لتنظيم سير القضايا، وشيد قصر الروضه والقصر العالي، وفي عهده تم ردم بركه الازبكيه تماماً وحولت الى متنزه ضخم. وفي عهد عباس باشا الاول منح امتياز انشاء خط سكك حديديه بين القاهره والاسكندريه للبريطانيين عام 1851، وانشئ حي العباسيه في صحراء شمال شرق القاهره عام 1849 بغرض اقامه ثكنات عسكريه، كما اقام فيها سراي الباشا او «سراي الحصوه» ومدرسه حربيه ومستشفى. عقب وفاه عباس الاول ال حكم مصر الى سعيد باشا، فافتتح في عهده خط السكك الحديديه بين القاهره والاسكندريه عام 1854، وانشئت المحطه الرئيسيه للسكك الحديديه بباب الحديد عام 1856، وبوفاته انتقل حكم مصر الى اسماعيل باشا عام 1863.\n\nعصر الخديوي اسماعيل\nيعود لقب القاهره الخديويه الى اول حاكم لمصر يحمل هذا اللقب وهو الخديوي اسماعيل، والذي تولى عرش مصر في 18 يناير 1863، فمنح القاهره وجهاً جديداً متالقاً، وحدد معالمها الحضاريه من خلال انجازات بقيت محفوره على جدران مبانيها وشوارعها الحديثه. كانت القاهره عند تولي اسماعيل باشا عرش مصر يبلغ تعدادها 270 الف نسمه وتمتد من منطقه القلعه بسفح المقطم شرقاً الى مدافن الازبكيه وميدان العتبه والمناصره غرباً، وساد على احيائها الانحلال العمراني مما اثار حماس اسماعيل باشا لصنع ثوره عمرانيه بعاصمه البلاد ترقى بها الى مصاف العواصم الاوروبيه، ولتكون «باريس الشرق»، فطلب اسماعيل باشا من الامبراطور نابليون الثالث ان يقوم هاوسمان المهندس العالمي بتخطيط القاهره على غرار التخطيط الجديد لباريس، واستغرق اعداد وتصميم وتنفيذ المشروع خمس سنوات، وفي عام 1872 افتتح الخديوي اسماعيل شارع محمد علي «القلعه»، كما شق شارع «كلوت بك» عام 1875، وانشا دار الاوبرا، والكتب خانه، وكان من اهم القصور التي شيدت خلال تلك الحقبه قصر عابدين، الذي بدا انشاؤه في غام 1863، واصبح مقر الحكم بدلاً من القلعه في عهد الخديوي اسماعيل، ويعود اسم القصر الى انه بني مكان قصر «عابدين بك»، وطلب اسماعيل باشا الاحتفاظ باسم عابدين للقصر وميدانه. وفي فتره لاحقه انشئ كوبري قصر النيل وكوبري ابو العلا ليصلا القاهره بجزيره الزمالك والجيزه، وادخل خط الترام الى شوارع القاهره عام 1896 لربط العتبه الخضراء بالعباسيه.\n\nالقاهره المعاصره\nفي بدايه القرن العشرين شهدت مدينه القاهره تطوراً هائلاً نتيجه قدوم رجال الاعمال الاجانب، وتم انشاء العديد من الوكالات والمحال التجاريه والتي اصبحت فيما بعد علامات تجاريه شهيره مثل جروبي وغيره، كذلك شهدت توسعاً من خلال ربط شبرا بالقاهره عام 1902، وربط حي الظاهر بالسيده زينب وغرب الازبكيه عام 1903، وبدا نمو حي الفجاله وحي التوفيقيه، كما بدا انشاء حي جاردن سيتي عام 1906، وتعمير حي الزمالك عام 1905، وبدا العمل في ضاحيه مصر الجديده عام 1906، اما ضاحيه المعادي فنشات عام 1907.\nوخلال ثوره 1919 كانت القاهره هي مركز الاحتجاجات والتي كانت تتخذ من بيت سعد زغلول (بيت الامه) مقراً لها، وعقب الثوره والانتهاء من تاسيس بنك مصر اصبحت القاهره مركز ومقر للعديد من الشركات والمشروعات المصريه التي نشات واحده تلو الاخرى، وبلغت القاهره في العشرينيات مستوى عال من الرقي والتحضر، ففي عام 1921 تم اختيارها لتنظيم مؤتمر القاهره الذي جمع العديد من قاده اوروبا والشرق الاوسط لبحث تداعيات الحرب العالميه الاولى، كذلك في عام 1925 حصلت على وسام اجمل وانظف مدينه في دول حوض البحر المتوسط باعتبارها مدينه الاناقه في تصميم مبانيها ونظافه شوارعها وانتظام حركه المرور بها.\n\nوفي نوفمبر 1943 اثناء الحرب العالميه الثانيه، شهدت القاهره اجتماع قاده الحلفاء في مؤتمر القاهره والذي حضره الرئيس فرانكلين روزفلت وونستون تشرشل والقائد الصيني تشان كاي شيك ورئيس وزراء تركيا عصمت اينونو، وكان المؤتمر بمثابه نقطه فارقه بصدور اعلان القاهره الذي تم التوقيع عليه يوم 27 نوفمبر 1943 ونص على نشر قوات في فرنسا وضروره انسحاب اليابان من المقاطعات الصينيه، واستمرار المعارك حتى الاستسلام غير المشروط.\n\nوفي 26 يناير 1952 عقب وقوع موقعه الاسماعيليه يوم 25 يناير بين القوات البريطانيه وقوات الشرطه المصريه، قام مجهولون باشعال حرائق في مدينه القاهره التهمت الكثير من الاماكن العامه والفنادق والسينيمات والمحلات تجاريه والمكاتب، كما اسفرت عن عشرات الضحايا. ادت تلك الاحداث الى استقاله وزاره الوفد ذات الشعبيه الجماهيريه، وتولى الوزاره علي ماهر باشا، واعلنت الاحكام العرفيه في البلاد، وتلاها في يوليو قيام الضباط الاحرار بالتحرك كبدايه لاحداث ثوره 23 يوليو، وكانت القاهره محطه فاصله في تلك الاحداث، بالرغم من ان الملك فاروق وحاشيته كانوا بالاسكندريه، الا ان حصار قصر عابدين والاستيلاء على القياده العامه للجيش المصري تسبب في رضوخ الملك فاروق لمطالب الحركه، ووافق على مغادره البلاد في 26 يوليو والتنازل عن العرش لابنه.\nوعقب حرب 1967 ونتيجه للمعارك تم اجلاء سكان محافظات القناه (بورسعيد، الاسماعيليه، السويس)، وكانت القاهره من اكثر المحافظات استقبالاً للنازحين والتي كانت باعداد كبيره، تسببت في اندلاع الازمه العقاريه وقتها وارتفاع اسعارها بشكل متزايد، وترتب عليها ظهور العديد من المناطق السكنيه مثل منشاه ناصر وغيرها.\n\nوفي اعقاب حرب اكتوبر وبدايه عصر الانفتاح الاقتصادي شهدت القاهره موجه هجره واسعه من سكان الاقاليم بغرض التعليم او العمل، وترتب عليها تغير ديموغرافيا المدينه عما كانت عليه، حيث بدات عمليات هدم القصور القديمه لبناء ابنيه سكنيه وكذلك شهدت فتره الثمانينات والتسعينيات اوسع عمليات التعدي والبناء على الاراضي الزراعيه، مما ترتب عليها فقدان القاهره معظم مساحاتها الخضراء. شهد الربع الاخير من القرن العشرين مرحله بناء المدن الجديده، فبعد انشاء مدينه نصر في عهد ناصر ومدينه 15 مايو ومدينه السلام في عهد السادات، شهد عهد مبارك انشاء القاهره الجديده ومدينه بدر والشروق، وشهد ايضاً تشغيل مترو الانفاق وانشاء الطريق الدائري ليكون اكبر طريق بري يربط القاهره الكبرى ببعضها.\nفي 25 يناير 2011 انطلقت مجموعه من التظاهرات والاحتجاجات الشعبيه ذات الطابع الاجتماعي والسياسي، وكان ميدان التحرير بالقاهره ابرز اماكن هذه المظاهرات حيث شهد اعداداً وصفت بالمليونيه، كما شهدت القاهره ايضاً احداث لاحقه مثل احداث مسرح البالون، احداث ماسبيرو، احداث محمد محمود، احداث مجلس الوزراء، احداث العباسيه.\nوعقب تولي محمد مرسي رئاسه الجمهوريه اتخذ عده اجراءات واصدر قرارات اثارت ضده احتجاجات ومظاهرات، كان ابرزها احداث قصر الاتحاديه مما اسفر عن وقوع ضحايا، وفي 30 يونيو 2013 خرجت مظاهرات حاشده من المعارضين لحكم محمد مرسي في الميادين المصريه وعلى راسها ميدان التحرير مطالبين بانتخابات رئاسيه مبكره ورحيل النظام.\n\nتوسعات المدينه\nاعتمدت الحكومه المصريه خطه استراتيجيه قوميه لغزو الصحراء واقامه مجتمعات عمرانيه جديده خارج وادي النيل ودلتاه لتكون مراكز حضاريه ومناطق جذب سكاني واقتصادي بهدف اعاده توزيع السكان والانشطه المختلفه توزيعاً متوازناً على انحاء جمهوريه مصر العربيه، وبدات تلك المشاريع خلال العهد الملكي مع انشاء ضاحيه مصر الجديده «هليوبوليس» التي تعد اهم التجارب على مستوى العالم في مجال انشاء المدن الجديده خلال النصف الاول من القرن العشرين، والتي تعود فكره انشائها الى عام 1905، واستوحي تخطيطها من المدن الحدائقيه التي شيدت في اوروبا نهايه القرن التاسع عشر، فكان انتشار الفراغات الحضريه الكبيره والشوارع المستقيمه المتسعه والتي خططت في هيئه حي عمراني راق يضاهي الاحياء الاوروبيه. وفي اعقاب ثوره 23 يوليو 1952 انشئت مدينه نصر بقرار من الرئيس جمال عبد الناصر بهدف التوسع العمراني في المنطقه الصحراويه شمال شرق القاهره وخصوصاً شرق حي العباسيه بعيداً عن الاراضي الزراعيه، واعطى اشاره البدء لانشاء مدينه متكامله باسلوب حضاري راق وطريقه عمرانيه متميزه اطلق عليها «مدينه نصر». نفذ التخطيط الاولي والتصاميم المعماريه لمشروع المدينه المهندس المعماري سيد كريم، على مساحه تصل لاكثر من 250 كم مربع وتمتد في الشرق من طريق مصر/السويس حتى الكيلو 51 وتقاطعه مع طريق القطاميه، وفي الغرب من شارع صلاح سالم وفي الشمال حي مصر الجديده وفي الجنوب المقطم. وفي عام 1978 بدا انشاء مدينه 15 مايو التي تعد احدى مدن الجيل الاول من المجتمعات العمرانيه الجديده التي قامت بانشائها وزاره الاسكان والتي تعود تسميتها نسبه الى ثوره التصحيح في 15 مايو 1971، ويربط مدينه 15 مايو بالقاهره طريقان رئيسيان هما كورنيش النيل وطريق الاوتوستراد، وبدات في استقبال سكانها بعد عامين فقط من البدء في تنفيذها. وفي عام 1979 صدر قرار انشاء مدينه القاهره الجديده والتي توسعت باحيائها المعروفه الامل والرحاب ومدينتي والتجمع الاول والثالث والخامس.\nوفي عام 1982 صدر قرار رئيس مجلس الوزراء بانشاء مدينه بدر بطريق القاهره/السويس على مساحه 18454.43 فدان، منها 7018 فدان مناطق سكنيه، و2173 فدان مناطق خدميه. وفي عام 1995 صدر قرار جمهوري بانشاء مدينه الشروق على مساحه 16.11 الف فدان منها 9200 فدان كتله عمرانيه، اضيف اليها 5302 فدان عام 2015.\n\nالجغرافيا والسكان\nالموقع\nتقع القاهره على جوانب جزر نهر النيل في شمال مصر، مباشره جنوب شرق النقطه التي يترك فيها نهر النيل واديه محصوراً فيِ الصحراء منقسماً الى فرعين داخل منطقه دلتا النيل المنخفضه. بني الجزء الغربي على نموذج مدينه باريس مِن قبل حاكم مصر الخديوي اسماعيل في منتصف القرن التاسع عشر، والذي تميز بالاحياء الواسعه والحدائق العامه والمناطق المفتوحه. اما القسم الشرقي الاقدم للمدينه فتوسع بشكل عشوائي على مدى القرون، وامتلا بالطرقِ الصغيره والمباني المزدحمه. بينما يمتلئ غرب القاهره بالبنايات الحكوميه والهندسه المعماريه الحديثه، واصبح الجزء الاهم في القاهره، ويحوي النصف الشرقي الاثار التاريخيه للمدينه على مر العصور لما يوجد به من مساجد وكنائس عتيقه ومباني اثريه ومعالم قديمه، كما توسعت المدينه شرقاً بانشاء حي مدينه نصر الذي يعتبر من اكبر احياء القاهره.\n\nالتقسيم الاداري\nتنقسم المدينه الى اربع مناطق رئيسيه هي:\n\nالمنطقه الشرقيه وتضم 9 احياء هي: (اول السلام، ثان السلام، المرج، عين شمس، المطريه، مصر الجديده، النزهه، غرب مدينه نصر، شرق مدينه نصر).\nالمنطقه الغربيه وتضم 9 احياء هي: (الوايلي، باب الشعريه، منشاه ناصر، عابدين، الموسكي، الازبيكه، بولاق، وسط، غرب).\nالمنطقه الشماليه وتضم 8 احياء هي: (الزيتون، حدائق القبه، الاميريه، الزاويه الحمراء، الشرابيه، الساحل، شبرا، روض الفرج).\nالمنطقه الجنوبيه وتضم 11 حي هم: (السيده زينب، مصر القديمه، الخليفه، المقطم، البساتين، دار السلام، المعادي، طره، حلوان، التبين، 15 مايو).\n\nالمناخ\nيتصف مناخ القاهره بالاعتدال معظم ايام السنه ويتراوح المعدل اليومي لدرجه الحراره خلال فصل الصيف بين 22 درجه مئويه و34 درجه مئويه في حين يتراوح المعدل اليومي خلال فصل الشتاء بين 18 درجه مئويه و9 درجه مئويه. ويمكن اعتبار ان هناك موسمين خلال العام صيف ساخن من مايو الى اكتوبر، وشتاء معتدل من نوفمبر الى ابريل، ويتميز مناخ القاهره ايضاً بانه جاف جداً، ويسقط المطر بكثافه منخفضه خلال فصل الشتاء، وترتفع مستويات الرطوبه خلال الصيف، واحياناً تتعرض القاهره لهبوب بعض الرياح الساخنه المحمله بالغبار خلال الفتره الممتده بين شهري مارس ويونيو وتعرف باسم رياح الخماسين.\n\nالسكان\nبلغ عدد سكان القاهره بنهايه عام 2018 9.7 مليون نسمه بنسبه 10.6% من اجمالي تعداد سكان مصر. لتكون بذلك اكثر مدن مصر الماهوله بالسكان، واكثرها ازدحاماً بما تحتويه من هيكل عرقي وبنيه اساسيه ووظائف محليه ودوليه متعدده، كما ينزح اليها الالاف يومياً من المحافظات بسبب عملهم داخل القاهره او انجاز المصالح الشخصيه او العلاج نتيجه لتركز الاستثمارات والاجهزه الحكوميه وكبرى المستشفيات بها.\n\nاللغه\nيتحدث سكان القاهره اللغه العربيه، الا ان العربيه المحكيه في القاهره تختلف عن تلك المحكيه في مصر الوسطى والعليا، والعربيه المصريه هي الاهم بين اشكال العربيه الحديثه المحكيه في المنطقه، ومرد ذلك اساسا ان صناعه السينما المصريه ومركزها القاهره هي الاكبر في الوطن العربي ويتم عرض الافلام المصريه في المنطقه العربيه دون ترجمه او دوبلاج. بخلاف الاخبار وما شابهها، كما ان الافلام لا تسجل باستخدام الفصحى - لغه كتابه الوطن العربي باسره - بل تستخدم اللغه المحكيه للمنطقه، وبالتالي كانت اللهجه المستخدمه هي المصريه لمعظم هذه الافلام، ولهذا السبب فان العربيه المصريه وخاصّه اللهجه القاهريه مفهومه في عموم المنطقه العربيه. العربيه الفصحى هي ومنذ السيطره العربيه على مصر في القرن السابع لغه الكتابه والادب، ولا تستخدم القبطيه الا كلغه طقسيه للكنيسه الارثوذكسيه القبطيه، والقبطيه هي استمرار للغه المصريه القديمه وتكتب بحروف مشتقه من اليونانيه وهي غير محكيه اليوم الا كلغه مقدسه. كلغات اجنبيه فان الانجليزيه والفرنسيه تستخدم كلغه نخبويه على نطاق ضيق.\n\nالدين\nالاسلام هو الدين الرسمي لمصر بما فيها مدينه القاهره وذلك طبقاً للدستور المصري، ويعترف بحقوق اتباع الديانات الثلاث اليهوديه والمسيحيه والاسلام، وغالبيه سكان المدينه من المسلمين من اهل السنه والجماعه، واكثر الاقليه من المسيحيين الارثوذكس، والاقليات الاخرى من طوائف مسيحيه بجانب اليهود. اهم المؤسسات الدينيه العامله في الدوله هي الجامع الازهر الذي يعتبر احد اهم اعمده الاسلام السني في العالم، كذلك تحتل الكنيسه القبطيه الارثوذكسيه مكانه هامه باعتبارها كنيسه وطنيه تمثل غالبيه مسيحيي مصر، اما اليهود فليس لهم مؤسسه دينيه ترعاهم لقله عددهم ولكن يرعى شئونهم طائفه خاصه بديانتهم.\n\nالثقافه\nالعماره\nتتميز القاهره كمدينه تاريخيه بتراثها العريق واحتضانها لمجموعه فريده من العمائر التي تعكس تطور العماره الاسلاميه بالمدينه على مدار الف وثلاثمائه عام واصبح الان هذا التطور البنائي متحفاً مفتوحاُ للعماره يعرض في ردهاته عمائر كل مرحله من مراحل تقدم المدينه في حلقه متصله من الاساليب المعماريه تتجلى في مبانيها كالمساجد والزوايا والمدارس والتكايا والقصور والدور والحمامات والاسبله والقناطر والوكالات والخانات والاسواق فضلاً عن قلاعها واسوارها وابوابها.\nاستلهمت العماره القاهريه المعاصره افكارها ومفرداتها من التراث المعماري المصري. ففي بدايات القرن العشرين اتجه بعض المعماريين الى استعمال العناصر الشكليه للطراز الفرعوني مثل البوابات والاعمده وقلدوها بالمواد والانشاءات الحديثه، وفي فتره التسعينيات استلهم الطراز الفرعوني في التصميم من خلال نقل مفردات المعبد الفرعوني الى واجهات المبنى، والتركيز على استخدام الشكل الهرمي كما في نصب الجندي المجهول بمدينه نصر. فيما استلهم بعض المعماريين تصميماتهم من التراث المعماري الاسلامي، وظهرت لذلك عده شواهد في النصف الاول من القرن العشرين مثل معهد الموسيقى العربيه بشارع رمسيس (1929) ومبنى جمعيه المهندسين المصريه بنفس الشارع (1935)، وفي فتره الثمانينيات والتسعينيات بدات تظهر نماذج لاعاده هذا الفكر المعماري منها مبنى مركز الدراسات التخطيطيه والمعماريه بمصر الجديده، ومبنى قاعه النيل للفنون التشكيليه بالجزيره، والمباني العاليه في ابراج مركز التجاره العالمي بكورنيش النيل، والذي يعطي دلاله واضحه على امكانيه الاستفاده من التراث الاسلامي مع معطيات العماره المعاصره والتي تركز على استخدام المباني العاليه خاصه في المدن الكبرى كاحد المحددات الاقتصاديه نظرا لارتفاع اسعار الاراضي.\n\nالاعلام\nتصدر الصحف المصريه الرئيسيه الرسميه وغير الرسميه من القاهره، ومنها مؤسسه الاهرام اعرق المؤسسات الصحفيه في مصر وتصدر عنها جريده الاهرام اليوميه والاهرام ايبدو وجريده المساء ومجله العربي ومجلات اخرى، ودار اخبار اليوم والتي يصدر عنها جريده الاخبار اليوميه واخبار اليوم الاسبوعيه والعديد من المجلات، ودار التحرير ويصدر عنها جريده الجمهوريه، ويصدر ايضا في القاهره العديد من الصحف الخاصه مثل جريده المصري اليوم وجريده الوفد والدستور وروز اليوسف وغيرها، وكذلك يوجد بالقاهره مقر وكاله انباء الشرق الاوسط، وهي وكاله الانباء الرئيسيه في مصر. والقاهره هي مقر قنوات مبنى الاذاعه والتلفزيون بماسبيرو الذي تنطلق منه القنوات الاذاعيه والتلفزيونيه الحكوميه.\n\nالفنون\nتزخر القاهره بالفنانين التشكيليين والنحاتين والمبدعين الفنيين المتواجدين بها بصفه دائمه، وتعد مركزاً للفنون بمختلف انواعها والامسيات والندوات الثقافيه والعروض المسرحيه والسينمائي، وهي واحده من المدن المبدعه المسجله في قائمه اليونسكو للمدن المبدعه في مجال الفنون والحرف منذ 2017م، وتتمثل ابرز مظاهر الفنون في القاهره في دار الاوبرا المصريه او المركز الثقافي القومي بجزيره الزمالك والذي تم تشييده كمنحه من الحكومه اليابانيه لنظيرتها المصريه وبنيت الدار على الطراز الاسلامي وتم افتتاحها في 10 اكتوبر 1988 كدار بديله لدار الاوبرا الخديويه التي بناها الخديوي اسماعيل عام 1869 واحترقت في 28 اكتوبر 1971 بعد ان ظلت مناره ثقافيه لمده 102 عام.\n\nالمطبخ\nالمطبخ القاهري هو راس المطبخ المصري البسيط المتنوع، الذي يعطى للخبز فيه الاولويه ويُطلق عليه العيش باللهجه القاهريه كمرادف للفظ الحياه، ويُعد طبقيّ الفول والطعميه من اشهر عناصر الفطور القاهري. كذلك يُعد الكشري والمسقعه والمحشي والملوخيه والفته والكوارع والارز بانواعه من ابرز الاطباق الرئيسيه. كما ان الشاي والقهوه وعصير القصب والعرقسوس والسوبيا من اكثر المشروبات شعبيه في المدينه.\n\nالاقتصاد\nالقاهره هي مركز مصر الاقتصادي، كونها عاصمه البلاد واكثر المدن المصريه الماهوله بالسكان، واقواها من حيث البنيه التحتيه، وبها تقع مقرات الشركات الكبرى، مركز التجاره العالمي، البورصه المصريه، البنك المركزي المصري، البنوك الرئيسيه، وزاره التجاره والصناعه، وزاره الاستثمار، وزاره التعاون الدولي، وهي المقر الاقليمي للمنظمه العربيه للتنميه الصناعيه والتعدين واختارتها المنظمات والمؤسسات الدوليه كمقر لمكاتبها الاقليميه في مصر مثل مؤسسه التمويل الدوليه، البنك الدولي، برنامج الامم المتحده الانمائي، منظمه العمل الدوليه، صندوق النقد الدولي، منظمه الامم المتحده للتنميه الصناعيه، منظمه الاقطار العربيه المصدره للبترول، مجلس الوحده الاقتصاديه العربيه. كما تضم عده مناطق صناعيه هي شق الثعبان على مساحه 1000 فدان، جنوب حلوان على مساحه 7 فدان، القطاميه على مساحه 71 فدان، الروبيكي على مساحه 1629 فدان. بخلاف مراكز الصناعه اليدويه المتمثله في مركز الحرف التقليديه بالفسطاط الذي يضم بين طياته ورشاً لانشطه عديده لفن النجاره من تطعيم بالصدف والارابيسك، وفن الزجاج المعشق بالجبس والحلي والخياميه والخزف. بجانب اسواق التحف والتذكارات والعطور الشهيره بخان الخليلي الذي يعد اشهر الخانات الاسلاميه في العالم، ويقع في القاهره الفاطميه على مشارف شارع المعز لدين الله، ويتخلله شبكه من الاسواق التقليديه وورش المقتنيات والمشغولات القضيه والنحاسيه والمذهبه والجلديه والخشبيه والورقيه. وفي عام 2009 احتلت القاهره المركز السابع ضمن ابرز 50 مدينه مؤهله لتقديم خدمات تكنولوجيا المعلومات بنظام التعهيد.\n\nالسياحه\nالقاهره مدينه سياحيه من الطراز الاول حيث تتعدد بها جميع المظاهر السياحيه التي قد يحتاج اليها اي زائر، فبها العديد من المواقع الاثريه التي تعود لعصر الفراعنه، واسوار المدينه القديمه التي ترجع الى العصر الاسلامي، والمواقع الاثريه الاسلاميه والمسيحيه واليهوديه الموجوده منذ دخول الاديان المختلفه لمصر.\nكما ينتشر بالمدينه مناطق التسوق الشهيره، والعشرات من القصور والمساجد والكنائس والبوابات التاريخيه والمباني العريقه من مختلف العصور بالاضافه للاماكن الثقافيه والفنيه والمسارح وغيرها، وينتشر بها اعداد كبيره من الفنادق واماكن الاقامه بمختلف انواعها ودرجاتها.\nوتزخر كذلك بالمحميات الطبيعيه البعيده عن زحام قلب المدينه، والتي تبرز كمزارات باعثه على الهدوء والراحه والتامل في الطبيعيه. بخلاف التمتع برحلات نهر النيل الذي بني على ضفتيه دره ما تملكه المدينه من منشات معماريه حديثه.\n\nالسياحه الترفيهيه\nالقاهره موقع لعده مزارات سياحيه ترفيهيه هامه تضم حدائق ترفيهيه على مساحات شاسعه يقبل عليها الكبار والصغار على حد سواء ومنها حديقه الازبكيه، الحديقه الدوليه، حديقه الفسطاط،  والحديقه اليابانيه بحلوان والتي تحتوي على بعض التماثيل التي ترمز لحقب تاريخيه مختلفه، مثل تمثال زهره اللوتس، تماثيل افيال الشرق التي تحرس المكان، تمثال وجه الحياه وهو لامراه تغمض عينيها مع ابتسامه خجل تعكس فكره تقديس الشرق للمراه، و48 تمثالاً لتلاميذ «شيبه» يجلس ليعلمهم الديانه البوذيه امام البحيره الكبيره، تمثال الحكمه الثلاثيه وهو لثلاثه قرود تحث الانسان على عدم التدخل في شؤون الغير «لا اسمع لا ارى لا اتكلم»، بالاضافه الى بحيره اللوتس وكشك الموسيقى والاشجار. وياتي على راس متنزهات القاهره حديقه الازهر التي تعد احد اضخم حدائق القاهره وواحده من اكبر واجمل حدائق العالم. تقع على مساحه 80 فدان كانت تستغل في الماضي كمقلب للقمامه والمخلفات لمده تزيد على الف عام. تم الاعلان عن المشروع في عام 1984 وافتتحت للزائرين في عام 2005 حيث استغرق انشاؤها اكثر من 7 اعوام بتكلفه اجماليه تزيد على 100 مليون جنيه تحملتها مؤسسه اغاخان للعماره الاسلاميه.\nكما يبرز برج القاهره كاحد معالم المدينه الحديثه والذي صممه المهندس نعوم شبيب، وتم بناؤه على شكل زهره اللوتس المصريه من الخرسانه المسلحه خلال الفتره من 1956 وحتى 1961. يقف البرج على قاعده من احجار الجرانيت الاسواني التي سبق ان استخدمها المصريون القدماء في بناء معابدهم ومقابرهم، ويصل ارتفاعه الى 187 متر وهو اعلى من الهرم الاكبر بالجيزه بحوالي 43 متر، ويتكون من 16 طابقاً، وتستغرق رحله الوصول الى قمه البرج 45 ثانيه داخل المصعد للوصول الى نهايته. يقع البرج في قلب القاهره على جزيره الزمالك بنهر

اشجار من حجاره. ووقع هذا التحول الطبيعي منذ العصر الاليجوسين اي منذ نحو 35 مليون سنه وتعد هذه الغابه الكثيفه من الاشجار المتحجره نتاجاً طبيعياً للعصر الذي بدات الانهار تدخل فيه الى مصر من الجنوب. كما توجد بالمحميه بعض تكوينات الايوسين الاعلى وتحتوي على بعض الحفريات اللافقاريه وعمرها يرجع الى 60 مليون سنه. وفي حلوان ينبع احد اشهر العيون المائيه في مصر وهي «عين حلوان»، والتي كانت مقصداً لاهالي وسكان

والمعارض نمطاً سياحياً هاماً لمدينه القاهره، وتحظى فعاليتها باقبال جماهيري من الداخل والخارج، وذلك بقصد تحقيق عده اهداف منها الترويج السياحي وتنويع مفردات الجذب السياحي، وتشجيع انشطه التسوق، ورعايه الاحداث الفنيه.\nوتاتي القاهره على راس المدن المصريه التي تستضيف المؤتمرات والمعارض الدوليه لما يتوافر بها من مراكز دوليه للمؤتمرات تتمتع بامكانيات فنيه وتكنولوجيه وتجهيزات حديثه، وامكانيه فندقيه عاليه المستوى تعمل على راحه ضيوف المدينه، ومن اهم تلك التجمعات معرض القاهره الدولي للكتاب، مهرجان القاهره الدولي للاغنيه الشعبيه، مهرجان القاهره السينمائي الدولي، مهرجان القاهره الدولي للمسرح التجريبي، مهرجان القاهره للاعلام العربي، مهرجان عيد وفاء النيل.\n\nسياحه زياره المقابر\nتقع في مصر 16 مقبره لمقابر الكومنولث منتشره بمحافظات القاهره، الاسكندريه، مطروح، بورسعيد، الاسماعيليه، السويس، اسوان. وتشرف عليها هيئه الكومنولث وهي منظمه تشرف على 23 الف موقع منتشره في 154 دوله لرفات ضحايا الحروب العالميه.\nتحظى المقابر باهتمام الالاف من احفاد ضحايا الحربين العالميه الاولى والثانيه بالعالم ممن يهتمون بزيارتها تخليداً لذكرى اجدادهم. ياتي نصيب القاهره في مقبرتين تقع الاولى بالقرب من شارع صلاح سالم وصممها السير روبرت لوريمر، والثانيه في هليوبوليس وصممها هربرت ورثينجتون.\n\nمواقع التراث العالمي\nتعد القاهره القديمه احدى اقدم مدن العالم الاسلاميّه بما تضمه من جوامع ومدارس وحمامات وينابيع. تاسست المدينه في القرن العاشر واصبحت مركزاً للعالم الاسلامي ووصلت لعصرها الذهبي في القرن الرابع عشر. وقررت لجنه اليونسكو ادراجها ضمن قائمه التراث العالمي في عام 1979. تضم القاهره التاريخيه انواعاً من العمائر رفيعه الطراز مثل المدارس والوكالات والخنقاوات والاسبله والحمامات والبيوت والقصور الاثريه مثل بيت السحيمي وقصر الامير بشتاك، والاسواق مثل خان الخليلي والصاغه والنحاسين، والاحياء العتيقه مثل التربيعه والخياميه وتحت الربع، ويحيط بها اسوار وبوابات مثل باب النصر وباب الفتوح والتي كانت تغلق قديماً في المساء لحفظ الامن والنظام.\nكما تحتضن المدينه عدداً ضخماً من المساجد القديمه منها جامع عمرو بن العاص الذي يعد اول بناء اقيم في الفسطاط، وجامع ابن طولون الذي يعتبر ثالث مسجد انشئ في مصر بعد جامع عمرو بن العاص وجامع العسكر وبدا بناءه عام 876 واتم تشييده في عام 879، فيما يعد الجامع الازهر اول عمل معماري فاطمي عاصر تاسيس القاهره وظل باقياً حتى اليوم وانشاه جوهر الصقلي قائد المعز لدين الله فبدا العمل في بنائه عام 970 وانتهى من تاسيسه عام 972، وفي عهد الخليفه الظافر بامر الله شيد مسجد الحسين عام 1154.\n\nالبنيه التحتيه\nالتعليم\nكانت القاهره منذ فتره طويله محور التعليم والخدمات التعليميه ليس فقط لمصر ولكن ايضاً للعالم الاسلامي قاطباً. وبالقاهره العدد الاكبر من المدارس والجامعات والمعاهد بين مدن مصر، ومرجع ذلك هو عدد سكانها الضخم. ولا يختلف التعليم في القاهره عن التعليم في باقي انحاء مصر، فهو تقريباً بنفس الجوده. يوجد بجانب المدارس الحكوميه العديد من المدارس الخاصه التي تدرس مناهج مشابهه للمناهج في المدارس الحكوميه ولكنها اقل في اعداد الطلاب واكثر كفاءه من المدارس الحكوميه الرسميه نظراً للدعم المالي المتوفر، وهناك مدارس اللغات التي تدرس نفس المناهج باللغات الانجليزيه او الفرنسيه او الالمانيه وهي تسير على النظام التعليمي المتبع في هذه الدول، وهناك المدارس الدينيه وعلى راسها المدارس الازهريه التي تتميز بذاتيتها في المناهج والزياده في بعض المواد الدينيه. وتعتبر القاهره هي مهد تاسيس جامعه القاهره كاول جامعه على النظم الحديثه، حيث تم انشاؤها تحت اسم (الجامعه المصريه) في قصر جناكليس (بشارع القصر العيني) عام 1907 قبل ان يتم نقل الجامعه الى مقرها الحالي بالجيزه، وتضم المدينه حالياً عده جامعات متنوعه ما بين عريقه وحديثه النشاه منها جامعه حلوان، جامعه عين شمس، جامعه الازهر، الجامعه الامريكيه، الجامعه الالمانيه، الجامعه الفرنسيه، الجامعه البريطانيه، الجامعه الروسيه، اكاديميه الشرطه، فرع الاكاديميه العربيه للعلوم.\n\nالصحه\nالقاهره موقع لمئات المستشفيات العامه والخاصه، ومن اشهر مستشفياتها الحديثه: عين شمس التخصصي، السلام الدولي، النزهه الدولي، دار الشفاء، دار الحكمه، كليوباترا، مستشفى العباسيه للصحه النفسيه، مستشفى الامراض الصدريه بالعباسيه، مستشفى 57357 لعلاج سرطان الاطفال بالمجان، المعهد القومي للكلى والمسالك البوليه، ويضم شارع القصر العيني التاريخي عده صروح صحيه هي المعهد القومي للاورام، المعهد القومي لابحاث الامراض المتوطنه والكبد، المعهد القومي للتغذيه، مستشفى قصر العيني. واختيرت المدينه ايضاً كمقر لاكبر مستشفيات اداره الخدمات الطبيه للقوات المسلحه المصريه ومنها المجمع الطبي للقوات المسلحه بكوبري القبه، المجمع الطبي للقوات المسلحه بالمعادي، مستشفى غمره العسكري، مستشفى الماظه العسكري، مستشفى الحلميه العسكري للعظام والتكميل، مستشفى العاملين المدنيين بالقوات المسلحه، مستشفى الجلاء لعائلات ضباط القوات المسلحه.\n\nالرياضه\nيوجد بالقاهره العدد الاكبر من الانديه الرياضيه الموجوده في مصر واكثرها شعبيه، بالاضافه لاكبر عدد من الملاعب والصالات الرياضيه لمختلف الالعاب. وقامت القاهره بتنظيم العديد من البطولات والدورات الرياضيه الافريقيه والشرق اوسطيه والاسلاميه والبحر متوسطيه والعالميه ومن ابرزها كاس الامم الافريقيه لكره القدم 1986، دوره الالعاب الافريقيه 1991، بطوله العالم لكره اليد للرجال 1999، بطوله العالم للاسكواش للرجال 2006، كاس الامم

هليوبوليس، نادي الشمس، نادي السكه الحديد، نادي المقاولون العرب، نادي النصر، وادي دجله. ومن اهم الصروح الرياضيه في القاهره ستاد القاهره الدولي الذي تاسس في عام 1955 واكتمل بناؤه عام 1960 وافتتحه الرئيس جمال عبد الناصر في احتفالات ثوره يوليو في نفس العام، وسمي باستاد ناصر، الى ان غير الاسم الرئيس محمد حسني مبارك ويعد من اكبر الصروح الرياضيه في الشرق الاوسط وافريقيا وبه مجمع لالعاب الصالات الصالات، وفي عام 2015 احتل المركز الـ 26 في قائمه افضل ملاعب العالم بناءً على عده معايير ابرزها السعه الجماهيريه وتاريخ الانشاء والهندسه المعماريه، وذلك بجانب ملاعب كره القدم الشهيره مثل ملعب الكليه الحربيه، ملعب 30 يونيو «ستاد الدفاع الجوي».\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nيصل محاور واحياء ومناطق القاهره ويربطها بباقي مدن ومحافظات مصر شبكه طرق ومواصلات ضخمه، يدار اغلبها باستخدام اشارات المرور الالكترونيه وتراقب بكاميرات المراقبه، وتخدم يومياً ملايين المواطنين. تضم تلك الشبكه عده كباري وجسور بالاضافه الى خطوط السكك الحديديه وقطارات الانفاق جنباً الى جنب الحافلات العامه وسيارات الاجره. ويربط المدينه بباقي مدن العالم ميناء القاهره الجوي الذي يعد المطار الاهم والاكبر في مصر.\n\nميناء القاهره الجوي\nميناء القاهره الجوي او مطار القاهره الدولي هو مطار دولي يقع على مسافه 22 كم شمال شرق مدينه القاهره، وتبلغ مساحته حوالي 40 مليون متر مربع. يعود تاريخ انشاء المطار الى عام 1942 وافتتح بشكله الحديث في عام 1963، ويعتبر البوابه الجويه الرئيسيه لمصر، فيما يعد ثاني اكبر مطار في قاره افريقيا من حيث الحركه الجويه بعد مطار كيب تاون بجنوب افريقيا. يمثل المطار حوالي 40% من الحركه الجويه بمصر ويرتبط بـ 91 مطار في مختلف انحاء العالم من خلال خطوط الطيران المختلفه. تبلغ الطاقه الاستيعابيه للمطار حالياً 22 مليون راكب سنوياً، ويستخدمه اكثر من 60 شركه طيران من مختلف دول العالم، وعشره شركات للشحن الجوي، بالاضافه لرحلات الطيران العارض ويقوم على ادارته وتشغيله شركه ميناء القاهره الجوي. اختير المطار كافضل مطارات افريقيا لعام 2006 من قبل اتحاد شركات الطيران الافريقيه وذلك من خلال استقصاء اجراه الاتحاد عن تطوير المطارات الافريقيه من حيث الاداء والبنيه التحتيه والتحديث المستمر. ازدادت اهميه المطار خاصه بعد انضمام شركه مصر للطيران الى تحالف ستار وتحول مطار القاهره الى مطار محوري يربط بين افريقيا والشرق الاوسط واوروبا، وذلك لتجميع ركاب الترانزيت والانطلاق بهم الى جميع مطارات العالم. يضم المطار ثلاثه مباني للركاب مبنى رقم (1) سعته 6 ملايين راكب/سنوياً، ومبنى رقم (2) سعته 3.5 مليون راكب/سنوياً، ومبنى رقم (3) سعته 11 مليون راكب/سنوياً، بالاضافه الى مبنى الرحلات الموسميه وسعته مليوني راكب/سنوياً، كما يضم اربعه مدارج لاقلاع وهبوط الطائرات.\n\nالنقل النهري\nبدا استخدام الاوتوبيس النهري عام 1961 كوسيله مواصلات ولاغراض الرحلات النيليه القصيره، وفي 1 مارس 2016 تم افتتاح مشروع التاكسي النهري من القاهره الى المعادي، على ان يبدا خط سير التاكسي النهري من مرسى نادي اليخت بكورنيش المعادي مروراً بثلاث محطات هي منيل الروضه، جاردن سيتي، وصولاً الى التحرير كمرحله اولى، بحيث يتم مد المشروع ليغطي باقي مناطق القاهره الكبرى. يعمل التاكسي النهري حالياً بشكل تجريبي لاغراض نقل الركاب والسياحه والرحلات وذلك للحين الانتهاء من اجراءات ترخيص المراسي من محافظتي القاهره والجيزه. وترتبط القاهره بباقي محافظات مصر بعده خطوط ملاحيه نهريه تتمثل في خط القاهره/اسوان، خط القاهره/الاسكندريه، خط القاهره/دمياط. تتمثل اهميه النقل النهري من منطلق انه اكثر وسائل الانتقال اماناً لقله الحوادث مقارنه بوسائل النقل الاخرى نظراً لانسيابيه الحركه، ولعدم وجود تقاطعات مروريه كما انه صديق للبيئه وكذلك يتمتع بمعدل استهلاك وقود منخفض والقدره على نقل الشحنات ذات الاحجام الكبيره والتي لا يمثل عنصر الوقت والسرعه اهميه كبيره في نقلها.\n\nالسكك الحديديه\nتعتبر محطه سكك حديد القاهره «محطه مصر او محطه رمسيس او محطه باب الحديد» من اقدم محطات السكك الحديديه الموجوده في العالم حيث تعد سكك حديد مصر هي اول خطوط سكك حديد يتم انشاؤها في افريقيا والشرق الاوسط والثانيه على مستوى العالم بعد المملكه المتحده حيث بدا انشاؤها في خمسينيات القرن التاسع عشر، وبدا تشغيلها في عهد الخديوي اسماعيل، ويقوم على تشغيل المحطه الهيئه القوميه لسكك حديد مصر التي تعرف اختصاراً باسم (س.ح.م) وهي شركه تمتلكها الحكومه المصريه بالكامل. خضعت المحطه الى عمليه تطوير شامله على مرحلتين تضمنت ترميم واجهه المحطه الرئيسيه التاريخيه، وتجديد صاله كبار الزوار ومكتب شرطه السياحه ومكتب ناظر المحطه، بالاضافه للارصفه الرئيسيه الاربعه والساحه الخارجيه للمحطه، وتم فتح عدد من المحلات التجاريه ومكاتب لبعض البنوك ومول تجاري يضم انشطه تجاريه وخدميه وترفيهيه ومقاهي بهدف زياده عائدات المحطه السنويه، بالاضافه الى اعاده تصميم البهو الرئيسي وتطوير صاله التذاكر لتصبح صاله الكترونيه، وزياده القدره الكهربائيه للمحطه، وتم تزويد المحطه بماكينات لصرف تذاكر القطارات من خلال بطاقات الدفع مقدماً، مع امكانيه الحجز عن طريق الكمبيوتر وبطاقات الصرف الالي، مما ادي الى تقليل الزحام على شباك التذاكر. وتم اضافه نصب تذكاري في البهو الرئيسي للمحطه على هيئه هرم نصفه الاعلى مفرغ لرؤيه هرم داخلي واخر بلوري يضم قائمه باسماء شهداء ثوره 25 يناير، وزودت المحطه ببوابات امنيه الكترونيه وشبكه مراقبه بالكاميرات. وصلت تكلفه تطوير المحطه الى 160 مليون جنيه، وقام باعداد المخطط العام والتصميمات والرسومات الهندسيه للمشروع المركز الهندسي للخدمه العامه بكليه الهندسه بجامعه الاسكندريه.\n\nالترام\nيعود تاريخ ترام القاهره او ترام مصر الجديده الى ثمانينات القرن الماضي، حينما قرر البارون امبان المهندس البلجيكي انشاء مصر الجديده، وكانت فكرته حينها بتدشين ترام يجوب الشوارع الفارغه ليجذب اليها المواطنين، وتولت شركه مصر الجديده للانشاء والتعمير مسئوليه تعمير المدينه الجديده وتوفير البنيه التحتيه من كهرباء ومياه وكذلك اداره الترام. كان الترام يمر بـ 16 محطه وشهد انكماشاً في عدد المحطات حتى وصلت حالياً الى 8 محطات فقط متمثله في 3 خطوط. يعد الترام وسيله مواصلات سهله واقتصاديه، ما يجعله الخيار الانسب لمحدودي الدخل. وبين الحين والاخر تنتشر اخبار عن الغاؤه بهدف توسيع الطرق التي يمر بها لتقليل معدل التكدسات المروريه، فيما تنفي المصادر الحكوميه تلك الاخبار وتصرح بنيتها لتطويره وتحديث العربات لتقديم خدمه افضل للمواطنين.\n\nقطارات الانفاق\nتحتل القاهره المركز السابع عالمياً بين اكثر مدن العالم ازدحاماً مما دعا الحكومه المصريه لاتخاذ اجراءات موازيه لتحسين شبكه المواصلات لكي تتماشى مع الزياده السكانيه بالمدينه وتستطيع ان تغطي متطلباتها، فبدا التفكير في مشروع مترو الانفاق كاحد حلول الازمه المروريه بالعاصمه المصريه. بدء تنفيذ المرحله الاولى من الخط الاول عام 1982، وانتهت في 1 اكتوبر 1987 والمرحله الثانيه في 12 ابريل 1989 ليربط المنطقه الصناعيه وجامعه حلوان بالمنطقه التجاريه بوسط القاهره ومنطقه شمال شرق القاهره، حيث وصل حتى المرج بطول 42.7 كم، ويرتبط الخط تبادلياً بخطوط السكك الحديديه الرئيسيه للوجه القبلي والبحري عند محطه الشهداء (مبارك سابقاً) وبخط السويس / اسماعيليه عند محطه عين شمس وبخط المرج / شبين القناطر / قليوب عند محطه المرج، ويبلغ عدد محطات الخط 34 محطه منهم 5 محطات نفقيه، وبقيه المحطات سطحيه. وبسبب الزياده للسكانيه ومشاكل النقل العام بدات الحكومه المصريه التفكير في دعم مترو الانفاق بانشاء خط ثاني يربط القاهره بمحافظتي الجيزه والقليوبيه ويربط محطه سكك حديد شبرا الخيمه مع محطه سكك حديد الجيزه. فانشئ الخط الثاني من محطه شبرا الخيمه الى الجيزه مروراً بمحطه الشهداء «رمسيس» ومحطه السادات «التحرير» التبادليه ايضاً. وتلبيه لمطالب النقل الكثيفه تم تنفيذ المرحله الاولى والثانيه والثالثه من الخط الثالث لمترو الانفاق ليربط شرق القاهره بغربها، مع تبادل الخدمه مع القطار الكهربائي الخفيف LRT في محطه عدلي منصور المركزيه، ومع الخط الاول في محطه جمال عبد الناصر ومع الخط الثاني في محطه العتبه، وذلك بهدف خفض المرور السطحي لوسائل النقل الاخرى بما يعادل مليوني رحله/يومياً، ووفر زمن الرحلات خلال العام بقدر 564 مليون ساعه لجميع وسائل النقل.\n\nسيارات الاجره\nاشتهرت سيارات الاجره بالقاهره باللونين الابيض والاسود. ثم انشئ جهاز تاكسي العاصمه لادخال سيارات حديثه الى شوارع القاهره تعمل الى جانب التاكسي القديم وتستخدم تعريفه ركوب محدده، وتميزت تلك السيارات باللون الاصفر. وذلك حتى بدات محافظه القاهره مشروع احلال وتبديل سيارات التاكسي القديم باخري حديثه تتميز باللون «الابيض» عن طريق جهاز تاكسي العاصمه، وبالتعاون بين محافظه القاهره ووزارتي البيئه والماليه وعدد من الجهات التنفيذيه. ويعتبر تاكسي لندن «الاسود» الذي ظهر في القاهره عام 2010 من افضل سيارات الاجره بالمدينه، رغم ارتفاع اسعاره نسبياً، الا انه موجه في الاساس لخدمه السائحين ورجال الاعمال. وبسبب تطور الخدمات التقنيه وانحدار خدمه التاكسي «الابيض»، ظهرت في اواخر عام 2015 شركات تستخدم السيارات الخاصه في الاغراض التجاريه لنقل الافراد باجر، وذلك باستخدام تطبيقات الاجهزه الذكيه.\n\nحافلات النقل العام\nيقوم على تشغيل حافلات نقل الافراد بالقاهره هيئه النقل العام التابعه لمحافظه القاهره والتي قامت منذ عام 2010 بالبدء في تحديث اسطولها من الحافلات وقامت بطرح اوتوبيسات جديده اختير لها اللون الاحمر، وسحب الاوتوبيسات القديمه ذات اللون الاخضر والاخرى ذات اللون الابيض. كما قامت بادخال اوتوبيسات اخرى جديده للخدمه في عام 2016، اختير لها اللون الازرق. وفي عام 2015 تسلمت القاهره 600 حافله نقل عام مقدمه كمنحه من دوله الامارات لتطوير اسطول هيئه النقل العام بالقاهره بقيمه اجماليه 550 مليون جنيه، والتي روعي في تصنيعها التمتع بمواصفات الخدمه الشاقه وان يتم تصنيعها بنسبه 50% في مصر والنصف الاخر في مصنع للحافلات بابوظبي بالامارات.\n\nالطرق البريه\nيربط مناطق القاهره عده محاور مروريه اشهرها الطريق الدائري وهو طريق محيطي انشئ بهدف ربط محافظات القاهره الكبرى، وتخفيف زحام السيارات داخل القاهره وضواحيها حيث تصل الحركه المروريه عليه الى اكثر من 100 الف سياره/يوم. بدات وزاره الاسكان في انشاء الطريق عام 1986 وتم الانتهاء منه بالكامل عام 2005 بطول اجمالي 100 كم. وكوبري اكتوبر الذي يتراوح عرضه بين 14 الى 34 متر ويشمل 23 مطلع ومنزل بعرض 7 الى 8 متر، يبدا الكوبري من الدقي ويعبر نهر النيل ويمر بمنطقه غمره حتى يصل الى طريق النصر. وشارع صلاح سالم الذي يعد من اكبر واطول شوارع القاهره، حيث تصب فيه روافد من جميع انحاء المدينه مما يجعله محوراً رئيسياً. وطريق النصر وشارع جسر السويس. ومن اشهر ميادين القاهره الخديويه ميدان التحرير، ميدان رمسيس، ميدان العتبه، ميدان التوفيقيه، ميدان طلعت حرب، ميدان عابدين، ميدان الفلكي، ميدان لاظوغلي، ميدان باب اللوق، ميدان مصطفي كامل، ميدان محمد فريد، ميدان الاوبرا. ومن ميادين القاهره القديمه ميدان السيده زينب، ميدان السيده عائشه، ميدان السيده نفيسه. ومن ميادين منطقه مصر الجديده والقبه ميدان العباسيه، ميدان حدائق القبه، ميدان روكسي، ميدان تريومف، ميدان المحكمه، ميدان الجامع، ميدان الكوربه، ميدان هليوبوليس. ومن ميادين مدينه نصر ميدان الساعه، ميدان رابعه العدويه.\n\nالمسافه بين القاهره والمدن المصريه\nفيما يلي جدول المسافه بالكيلومتر بين مدينه القاهره وبعض المدن المصريه:\n\nمشاكل المدينه\nالعشوائيات\nتعد مشكله العشوائيات من مشكلات المدينه المعاصره التي نمت اوضاعها مع الزياده السكانيه التي شهدتها المدينه منذ الستينات، وما صاحب ذلك من تغيرات اجتماعيه واقتصاديه ادت الى استمرار تزايد معدلات الهجره من الريف الى القاهره مما اسفر عن معدلات طلب متزايده بسوق العقارات يقابلها نقص في عدد الوحدات السكنيه المطروحه، فظهرت على السطح مشكله المناطق العشوائيه التي تنوعت ما بين مساكن الايواء المؤقت، ومساكن وضع اليد المشيده على اراضي مغتصبه، والمساكن المشيده بتقاسيم غير معتمده او بدون تراخيص قانونيه. ونتيجه لتفشي تلك الظاهره بالقاهره وعده مدن مصريه اخرى، بدات الحكومه المصريه في التعامل معها عن طريق عده محاور منها التطوير من خلال موازنه الدوله، التطوير من خلال التعاون مع جهات دوليه، التطوير من خلال التعاون مع الجمعيات الاهليه ورجال الاعمال والمجتمع المدني، التطوير من خلال التعاون مع الوزارات ذات الصله باماكن التطوير.\n\nالتلوث\nتتعدى نسبه تلوث هواء القاهره بالاتربه المؤشرات الدوليه بـ 7 مرات، وصنفها المؤتمر السنوي الـ 11 للجمعيه المصريه للشعب الهوائيه والصدر والحساسيه القاهره كثالث اكثر مدن العالم في معدل تلوث الهواء بعد مدينتي «نيومكسيكو» المكسيكيه، والعاصمه الصينيه «بكين». ويعود ارتفاع نسبه التلوث بالقاهره الى عده اسباب منها الدخان الناتج عن حرق قش الارز في بعض محافظات الدلتا وشمال الصعيد القريبه من القاهره، مما يشكل ما يعرف منذ سنوات بظاهره «السحابه السوداء»، كما تضخ المصانع بالقاهره والمحافظات القريبه منها (الجيزه والقليوبيه) والتي تصل الى حوالي 12600 منشاه صناعيه كميات كبيره من الملوثات والادخنه، فيما تضخ حرائق القمامه في الاماكن المكشوفه داخل القاهره وفي المحافظات القريبه منها بالاضافه الى عوادم وسائل النقل والمواصلات اطنان من الادخنه الملوثه. وتقدر الخسائر الماديه المترتبه على تلوث الهواء والجو في القاهره بحوالي 10 مليارات جنيه سنوياً.\n\nالزحام\nاصبحت مشكله التكدس المروري والزحام بالقاهره احد ازمات المدينه اليوميه، وخصوصاً خلال ساعات الذروه. وكشفت دراسه حديثه عن ازمه المرور بالقاهره صادره عن البنك الدولي بالاشتراك مع المعهد القومي للنقل التابع لوزاره النقل ان الزحام المروري في القاهره يتسبب في خسائر سنويه للدوله تقدر بحوالي 50 مليار جنيه، بما يعادل %4 من اجمالي الناتج المحلي السنوي للدوله، تشمل تكاليف الوقود والاثار الصحيه الناتجه من سوء نوعيه الهواء والحوادث، بجانب التاخير في الانتقال والوصول. واضافت الدراسه ان متوسط السرعه على الطرق الرئيسيه في القاهره تتراوح بين 15 و40 كم في الساعه. وتعود تلك المشكله الى عده عوامل اهمها الزياده السكانيه غير المخطط لها، وبالتالي لم تتمكن الشوارع العامه من استيعاب تلك الاعداد وتحقيق سيوله مروريه مقبوله، اهمال صيانه الطرق الرئيسيه وتوسيعها ودعمها بانظمه مروريه حديثه وتخطيط اماكن للانتظار، عدم وجود حارات خاصه لحافلات النقل العام ومقطورات النقل الثقيل، عدم تطبيق قواعد المرور بحزم، ضعف سلوكيات القياده، انتشار الباعه الجائلين بالميادين والشوارع، ظاهره المواقف العشوائيه، قله ساحات انتظار السيارات سواء السطحيه او متعدده الطوابق.\n\nاعلام المدينه\nمحمد رفعت، رائد قراء القران الكريم في مصر، من مواليد 9 مايو 1882 بحي المغربلين.\nطلعت حرب، رائد الاقتصاد

          "content": "Alexandria is a major city in Egypt. Lying at the western edge of the Nile River Delta, it extends about 40 km (25 mi) along the country's northern coast. It is Egypt's principal seaport, the second largest city after Cairo, and the largest city on the Mediterranean coast. Founded in 331 BC by Alexander the Great, Alexandria is one of the largest and most important cities of antiquity and a leading hub for science, culture, and scholarship. \nNicknamed the \"Bride of the Mediterranean\" and \"Pearl of the Mediterranean Coast\", the city is a popular tourist destination and a major industrial centre. It is the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and in the Middle East, and the eleventh-largest city and urban area in Africa. Alexandria was established originally near an ancient Egyptian settlement named Rhacotis, which later became its Egyptian quarter. The city was made the capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and became the foremost commercial, intellectual, and cultural centre for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity; at one time, it was the most populous city in the ancient world. Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library, the largest in the ancient world; and the Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages.\nAlexandria retained its status as one of the leading cities of the Mediterranean world for almost a millennium, through the period of Roman and Byzantine rule until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, when a new capital was founded at Fustat, now part of Cairo. The city was a major hub of early Christianity and hosted the Patriarchate of Alexandria, one of the leading Christian centres in the Eastern Roman Empire; the modern Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.  \nBy the mid seventh century, Alexandria had already been largely plundered and lost its significance, although it persisted as a trading hub and naval base. From the late 18th century, it was a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world, owing to the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean and Red Seas and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton. Alexandria’s rebirth began in the early 19th century under Muhammad Ali, considered the founder of modern Egypt, who implemented infrastructure projects and modernisation efforts.\n\nName\nAlexandria was located on the earlier Egyptian settlement, which was called Rhacotis (Ancient Greek: Ῥακῶτις, romanized: Rhakôtis), the Hellenised form of Egyptian r-ꜥ-qd(y)t. As one of many settlements founded by Alexander the Great, the city he founded on Rhacotis was called Alexándreia hḗ kat' Aígypton (Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ κατ' Αἴγυπτον), which some sources translated as \"Alexandria by Egypt\", as the city was, at that time, in the periphery of Egypt proper (the area beside the Nile). Some of the Alexandrian and Greek populaces, e.g., Hypsicles, also referred to the city as Alexándreia hḗ prós Aígypton (Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ πρός Αἴγυπτον, \"Alexandria near Egypt\"). In the course of Roman rule in Egypt, the city's name was Latinised as Alexandrēa ad Aegyptum.\nAfter the capture of Alexandria by the Rashiduns in AD 641, the name was Arabicised: initial Al- was re-analysed into the definite article; metathesis occurred on x, from [ks] to [sk]; and the suffix -eia was assimilated into the feminine adjectival suffix -iyya (ـِيَّة), finally rendering the name al-ʔiskandariyya (الْإِسْكَنْدَرِيَّة).\n\nHistory\nAncient era\nRadiocarbon dating of seashell fragments and lead contamination show human activity at the location during the period of the Old Kingdom (27th–21st centuries BC) and again in the period 1000–800 BC, followed by the absence of activity after that. From ancient sources it is known there existed a trading post at this location during the time of Rameses the Great for trade with Crete, but it had long been lost by the time of Alexander's arrival. A small Egyptian fishing village named Rhakotis (Egyptian: rꜥ-qdy.t, 'That which is built up') existed since the 13th century BC in the vicinity and eventually grew into the Egyptian quarter of the city. Just east of Alexandria (where Abu Qir Bay is now), there were in ancient times marshland and several islands. As early as the 7th century BC, there existed important port cities of Canopus and Heracleion. The latter was recently rediscovered underwater.\n\nAlexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in April 331 BC as Ἀλεξάνδρεια (Alexandreia), as one of his many city foundations. After he captured the Egyptian Satrapy from the Persians, Alexander wanted to build a large Greek city on Egypt's coast that would bear his name. He chose the site of Alexandria, envisioning the building of a causeway to the nearby island of Pharos that would generate two great natural harbours. Alexandria was intended to supersede the older Greek colony of Naucratis as a Hellenistic center in Egypt and to be the link between Greece and the rich Nile valley. A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to the city during his life.\nAfter Alexander's departure, his viceroy Cleomenes continued the expansion. The architect Dinocrates of Rhodes designed the city, using a Hippodamian grid plan. Following Alexander's death in 323 BC, his general Ptolemy Lagides took possession of Egypt and brought Alexander's body to Egypt with him. Ptolemy at first ruled from the old Egyptian capital of Memphis. In 322/321 BC he had Cleomenes executed. Finally, in 305 BC, Ptolemy declared himself Pharaoh as Ptolemy I Soter (\"Savior\") and moved his capital to Alexandria.\nAlthough Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandria's early development, the Heptastadion and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined Tyre and becoming the centre of the new commerce between Europe and the Arabian and Indian East, the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than Carthage. In one century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became Egypt's main Greek city, with Greek people from diverse backgrounds.\nThe Septuagint, a Greek version of the Tanakh, was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept the city in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic centre of learning (Library of Alexandria, which faced destruction during Caesar's siege of Alexandria in 47 BC), but were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, Egyptian and Jewish. By the time of Augustus, the city grid encompassed an area of 10 km2 (3.9 sq mi), and the total population during the Roman principate was around 500,000–600,000, which would wax and wane in the course of the next four centuries under Roman rule.\nAccording to Philo of Alexandria, in the year 38 AD, disturbances erupted between Jews and Greek citizens of Alexandria during a visit paid by King Agrippa I to Alexandria, principally over the respect paid by the Herodian nation to the Roman emperor, which quickly escalated to open affronts and violence between the two ethnic groups and the desecration of Alexandrian synagogues. This event has been called the Alexandrian pogroms. The violence was quelled after Caligula intervened and had the Roman governor, Flaccus, removed from the city.\n\nIn 115 AD, large parts of Alexandria were destroyed during the Diaspora revolt, which gave Hadrian and his architect, Decriannus, an opportunity to rebuild it. In 215 AD, the emperor Caracalla visited the city and, because of some insulting satires that the inhabitants had directed at him, abruptly commanded his troops to put to death all youths capable of bearing arms. On 21 July 365 AD, Alexandria was devastated by a tsunami (365 Crete earthquake), an event annually commemorated years later as a \"day of horror\".\n\nIslamic era\nIn 619, Alexandria fell to the Sassanid Persians. The city was mostly uninjured by the conquest and a new palace called Tarawus was erected in the eastern part of the city, later known as Qasr Faris, \"fort of the Persians\". Although the Byzantine emperor Heraclius recovered it in 629, in 641 the Arabs under the general 'Amr ibn al-'As invaded it during the Muslim conquest of Egypt, after a siege that lasted 14 months. The first Arab governor of Egypt recorded to have visited Alexandria was Utba ibn Abi Sufyan, who strengthened the Arab presence and built a governor's palace in the city in 664–665.\nIn reference to Alexandria, Ibn Battuta speaks of a number of Muslim saints that resided in the city. One such saint was Imam Borhan Oddin El Aaraj, who was said to perform miracles. Another notable figure was Yaqut al-'Arshi, a disciple of Abu Abbas El Mursi. Ibn Battuta also writes about Abu 'Abdallah al-Murshidi, a saint that lived in the Minyat of Ibn Murshed. Although al-Murshidi lived in seclusion, Ibn Battuta writes that he was regularly visited by crowds, high state officials, and even by the Sultan of Egypt at the time, al-Nasir Muhammad. Ibn Battuta also visited the Pharos lighthouse on two occasions: in 1326 he found it to be partly in ruins and in 1349 it had deteriorated to the point that it was no longer possible to enter.\nThroughout the late medieval period, Alexandria re-emerged as a major metropolis and the most important commercial port in Egypt and one of the most important in the Mediterranean. The jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela even described it as “a trading market for all nations”. Indeed, Alexandria was the outlet for all goods coming from Arabia, such as incense, and from India and South-East Asia, such as spices (pepper, cloves, cinnamon, etc.), precious stones, pearls and exotic woods like brazilwood. But it was also the outlet for goods from Africa, such as ivory and precious woods. These goods arrived in Alexandria after passing through Aden on their way to the Red Sea, then headed up the Red Sea to be unloaded in the port of Aydhab. From Aydhab, a caravan took the goods to the Nile, probably to the town of Qus. From there, the goods sailed to Alexandria. These goods then found their way to the Alexandria market alongside Egyptian products.\nThis route was the cheapest and fastest in comparison with the land routes that reached the Mediterranean from Syria or Constantinople. Latin merchants (Venetians, Genoese, Pisans, Aragonese, Provençals, etc.) thus entered this market. As early as the 12th century, the major trading cities had funduqs and consuls in Alexandria. A funduq, in this context is an area, often fortified, within the city dedicated to the community of a trading nation under the authority of a consul. The consul was responsible for adjudicating disputes between merchants of his nation, and also when a subject of the sultan lodged a complaint against a merchant of their nation.The terms of this installation were often set out in treaties between the sultans and the consuls. These treaties were part of a policy pursued by the early Mamluk sultans, who encouraged the arrival of merchants from Europe in Alexandria, since this trade not only brought the sultan considerable revenue, but also enabled him to obtain supplies of wood and iron from Europe. Later, in the 14th century, the Latin trade in Alexandria was also important for the sultans, as it enabled them to obtain supplies of mameluks (slave-soldiers) often sold by Genoese merchants.\n\nAs this trade was very important to the sultans, they were keen to control the city's institutions. Indeed, in Alexandria, in addition to an Emir (governor), the sultan sent a customs inspector who answered directly to the nazir al-khas (person in charge of managing the sultan's patrimony). Customs was not only responsible for collecting customs duties, but also for the security of the port and its warehouses. Alexandria customs also played a role in commercial arbitration and was the preferred circuit for the sale of products brought in by the merchants, which took place at auction. These sales were set up to encourage the merchants to sell their products to or through the sultan, rather than selling them freely on the city's markets. Latin merchants also had jurisdictional privileges : in addition to being judged by their consul if a subject of the sultan lodged a complaint against them, Latin merchants could not be judged by the qadis (civil judges) but had to be judged by the mazalim (the sultan's courts).Alexandria lost much of its importance in international trade after Portuguese navigators discovered a new sea route to India in the late 15th century. This reduced the amount of goods that needed to be transported through the Alexandrian port, as well as the Mamluks' political power. After the Battle of Ridaniya in 1517, the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and remained under Ottoman rule until 1798. Alexandria lost much of its former importance to the Egyptian port city of Rosetta during the 9th to 18th centuries, and it only regained its former prominence with the construction of the Mahmoudiyah Canal in 1820.\nAlexandria figured prominently in the military operations of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the city, which fell to them on 2 September 1801. Muhammad Ali, the Ottoman governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810 and, by 1850, Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory. Egypt turned to Europe in their effort to modernise the country. Greeks, followed by other Europeans and others, began moving to the city. In the early 20th century, the city became a home for novelists and poets.In July 1882, the city came under bombardment from British naval forces and was occupied.\nIn July 1954, the city was a target of an Israeli bombing campaign that later became known as the Lavon Affair. On 26 October 1954, Alexandria's Mansheya Square was the site of a failed assassination attempt on Gamal Abdel Nasser.\nEuropeans began leaving Alexandria following the 1956 Suez Crisis that led to an outburst of Arab nationalism. The nationalisation of property by Nasser, which reached its highest point in 1961, drove out nearly all the rest.\n\nGeography\nAlexandria is located in the country of Egypt, on the southern coast of the Mediterranean. It is in the Far West Nile delta area. It is a densely populated city; its core areas belie its large administrative area. The city's geology constitutes of soil sediments, oolitic sand and clay, oolitic limestone (from the Middle Miocene), grey shelly dolomite, marly dolomite, oncolitic limestone and dolomite, and as well as shelly limestone.\n\nNotes: 2020 CAPMAS projection based on 2017 revised census figures, may differ significantly from 2017 census preliminary tabulations. The 14 kisms were reported simply as Alexandria city by CAPMAS in 2006 but given explosive growth definitions, likely informal, may have changed or may be set to change. Same area with 12 kisms existed in 1996. Kisms are considered 'fully urbanised'\n\nClimate\nAlexandria has a hot steppe climate (Köppen climate classification: BSh), virtually hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification: BWh). Like the rest of Egypt's northern coast, the prevailing north wind, blowing across the Mediterranean, gives the city a less severe climate than the desert hinterland. Rafah and Alexandria are the wettest places in Egypt; the other wettest places are Rosetta, Baltim, Kafr el-Dawwar, and Mersa Matruh. The city's climate is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea, moderating its temperatures, causing variable rainy winters and moderately hot and slightly prolonged summers that, at times, can be very humid; January and February are the coolest months, with daily maximum temperatures typically ranging from 12 to 18 °C (54 to 64 °F) and minimum temperatures that could reach 5 °C (41 °F).\nAlexandria experiences violent storms, rain and sometimes sleet and hail during the cooler months; these events, combined with a poor drainage system, have been responsible for occasional flooding in the city in the past though they rarely occur anymore. July and August are the hottest and driest months of the year, with an average daily maximum temperature of 30 °C (86 °F). The average annual rainfall is around 211 mm (8.3 in) but has been as high as 417 mm (16.4 in)\nPort Said, Kosseir, Baltim, Damietta and Alexandria have the least temperature variation in Egypt.\nThe highest recorded temperature was 45 °C (113 °F) on 30 May 1961, and the coldest recorded temperature was 0 °C (32 °F) on 31 January 1994.\n\nClimate change\nA 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a \"moderate\" scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~2.5–3 °C (4.5–5.4 °F) by 2100, the climate of Alexandria in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Gaza City. The annual temperature would increase by 2.8 °C (5.0 °F), and the temperature of the warmest and the coldest month by 2.9 °C (5.2 °F) and 3.1 °C (5.6 °F). According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with 2.7 °C (4.9 °F), which closely matches RCP 4.5.\nDue to its location on a Nile river delta, Alexandria is one of the most vulnerable cities to sea level rise in the entire world. According to some estimates, hundreds of thousands of people in its low-lying areas may already have to be relocated before 2030. The 2022 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report estimates that by 2050, Alexandria and 11 other major African cities (Abidjan, Algiers, Cape Town, Casablanca, Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Durban, Lagos, Lomé, Luanda and Maputo) would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US$65 billion for the \"moderate\" climate change scenario RCP 4.5 and US$86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5, while RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from marine ice sheet instability at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damages. Additional accounting for the \"low-probability, high-damage events\" may increase aggregate risks to US$187 billion for the \"moderate\" RCP4.5, US$206 billion for RCP8.5 and US$397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario. In every single estimate, Alexandria alone bears around half of these costs. Since sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years under every scenario of climate change, future costs of sea level rise would only increase, especially without adaptation measures. Recent studies published in Earth's Future by the American Geophysical Union indicate that rising sea levels are causing increases in coastal aquifer levels, reaching building foundations and accelerating their corrosion and potential collapse. The study predicts that in 2025, more than 7000 buildings in Alexandria will be at risk of collapse due to these groundwater processes.\n\nAncient layout\nGreek Alexandria was divided into three regions:\n\nRhakotis\nRhakotis (from Coptic Rakotə, \"Alexandria\") was the old city that was absorbed into Alexandria. It was occupied chiefly by Egyptians.\n\nBrucheum\nBrucheum was the Royal or Greek quarter and formed the most magnificent portion of the city. In Roman times, Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal.\n\nJewish quarter\nThe Jewish quarter was the northeast portion of the city.\n\nTwo main streets, lined with colonnades and said to have been each about 60 m (200 ft) wide, intersected in the centre of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his Mausoleum) rose. This point is very near the present mosque of Nebi Daniel; the line of the great East–West \"Canopic\" street is also present in modern-day Alexandria, having only slightly diverged from the line of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharae Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.Alexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a 1,260 m-long (4,130 ft) mole and called the Heptastadion (\"seven stadia\"—a stadium was a Greek unit of length measuring approximately 180 m or 590 ft). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the \"Moon Gate\" rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern \"Ras al-Tin\" quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbour, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbour.\nIn Strabo's time (latter half of the 1st century BC), the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbour.\n\nThe Royal Palaces, filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbour on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the \"Private Port\", and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land subsidence here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.\nThe Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by Julius Caesar as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after he took Egypt after the battle of Pharsalus.\nThe Poseidon, or Temple of the Sea God, close to the theater\nThe Timonium built by Marc Antony\nThe Emporium (Exchange)\nThe Apostases (Magazines)\nThe Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole\nBehind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great obelisks which became known as \"Cleopatra's Needles\" and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.\nThe Gymnasium and the Palaestra are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.\nThe Temple of Saturn; site unknown.\nThe Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.\nThe Musaeum with its famous Library and theater in the same region; site unknown.\nThe Serapeum of Alexandria, the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near \"Pompey's Pillar\", which was an independent monument erected to commemorate Diocletian's siege of the city.\nThe names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, The Great Lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, reputed to be 138 m (453 ft) high, was situated. The first Ptolemy began the project, and the second Ptolemy (Ptolemy II Philadelphus) completed it, at a total cost of 800 talents. It took 12 years to complete and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the Great Pyramid of Giza. A temple of Hephaestus also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.\nIn the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens, according to a census dated from 32 AD, in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves. Estimates of the total population range from 216,000 to 500,000, making it one of the largest cities ever built before the Industrial Revolution and the largest pre-industrial city that was not an imperial capital.\n\nCityscape\nDue to the constant presence of war in Alexandria in ancient times, very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbour and the rest has been built over in modern times.\n\nPompey's Pillar\n\"Pompey's Pillar\", a Roman triumphal column, is one of the best-known ancient monuments still standing in Alexandria today. It is located on Alexandria's ancient acropolis—a modest hill located adjacent to the city's Arab cemetery—and was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its pedestal, it is 30 m (99 ft) high; the shaft is of polished red granite, 2.7 m (8.9 ft) in diameter at the base, tapering to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) at the top. The shaft is 88 ft (27 m) high and made out of a single piece of granite. Its volume is 132 m3 (4,662 cu ft) and weight approximately 396 tons. Pompey's Pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient obelisks. The Romans had cranes, but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several obelisk erecting experiments including a successful attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk.\n\"Pompey's Pillar\" is a misnomer, as it has nothing to do with Pompey, having been erected in 293 for Diocletian, possibly in memory of the rebellion of Domitius Domitianus. The structure was plundered and demolished in the 4th century when a bishop decreed that Paganism must be eradicated. Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god Serapis were enacted and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years, many ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea, mostly pieces of old pottery.\n\nCatacombs of Kom El Shoqafa\nAlexandria's catacombs, known as Kom El Shoqafa, are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large spiral staircase and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other syncretic Romano-Egyptian religious symbols, burial niches, and sarcophagi, as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased. The catacombs were long forgotten by the citizens until they were discovered by accident in 1900.\n\nKom El Deka\nThe most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as Kom El Deka. It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its Roman-era baths.\n\nTemple of Taposiris Magna\nThe temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris, which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir, the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries. Also found in the same area are remains of public baths built by the emperor Justinian, a seawall, quays and a bridge. Near the beach side of the area, there are the remains of a tower built by Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The tower was an exact scale replica of the destroyed Alexandrine Pharos Lighthouse.\n\nCitadel of Qaitbay\nCitadel of Qaitbay is a defensive fortress located on the Mediterranean sea coast. It was established in 1477 AD (882 AH) by the mamluk Sultan Al-Ashraf Sayf al-Din Qa'it Bay. The Citadel is located on the eastern side of the northern tip of Pharos Island at the mouth of the Eastern Harbour. It was erected on the exact site of the famous Lighthouse of Alexandria, which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was built on an area of 17,550 square metres.\n\nExcavation\nPersistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local Archaeological Society and by many individuals. Excavations were performed in the city by Greeks seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great without success.\nThe past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; D. G. Hogarth made tentative researches on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898–1899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.\nSince the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. Cleopatra VII's royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami, leading to gradual subsidence in the 4th century AD. This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team. It raised a noted head of Caesarion. These are being opened up to tourists, to some controversy. The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman strata.\nThe most important results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighbourhood of \"Pompey's Pillar\", where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense catacombs and columbaria have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.\nThe objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in Kom El Shoqafa (Roman) and Ras El Tin (painted).\nThe German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of Kom El Deka, which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.\nThe making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered.\n\nPlaces of worship\nIslam\nThe most famous mosque in Alexandria is Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi Mosque in Bahary. Other notable mosques in the city include Ali ibn Abi Talib mosque in Somouha, Bilal mosque, al-Gamaa al-Bahari in Mandara, Hatem mosque in Somouha, Hoda el-Islam mosque in Sidi Bishr, al-Mowasah mosque in Hadara, Sharq al-Madina mosque in Miami, al-Shohadaa mosque in Mostafa Kamel, Al Qa'ed Ibrahim Mosque, Yehia mosque in Zizinia, Sidi Gaber mosque in Sidi Gaber, Sidi Besher mosque, Rokay el-Islam mosque in Elessway, Elsadaka Mosque in Sidibesher Qebly, Elshatbi mosque and Sultan mosque.\nAlexandria is the base of the Salafi movements in Egypt. Al-Nour Party, which is based in the city and overwhelmingly won most of the Salafi votes in the 2011–12 parliamentary election, supports the president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\nChristianity\nAlexandria was once considered the third-most important city in Christianity, after Rome and Constantinople. Until 430, the Patriarch of Alexandria was second only to the bishop of Rome. The Church of Alexandria had jurisdiction over most of the continent of Africa. After the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, the Alexandrian Church split between the Miaphysites and the Melkites. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the Coptic Orthodox Church. The Melkites went on to constitute what is known today as the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria. In the 19th century, Catholic and Protestant missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.\nToday the Patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is Saint Mark Cathedral (though in practice the Patriarch has long resided in Cairo). The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include Pope Cyril I Church in Cleopatra, Saint George's Church in Sporting, Saint Mark and Pope Peter I Church in Sidi Bishr, Saint Mary Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, Saint Mina Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara and Saint Takla Haymanot's Church in Ibrahimeya.\nThe most important Eastern Orthodox churches in Alexandria are Agioi Anárgyroi Church, Church of the Annunciation, Saint Anthony Church, Archangels Gabriel and Michael Church, Taxiarchon Church, Saint Catherine Church, Cathedral of the Dormition in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, Prophet Elijah Church, Saint George Church, Saint Joseph Church in Fleming, Saint Joseph of Arimathea Church, Saint Mark and Saint Nektarios Chapel in Ramleh, Saint Nicholas Church, Saint Paraskevi Church, Saint Sava Cathedral in Ramleh, Saint Theodore Chapel and the Russian church of Saint Alexander Nevsky in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.\nThe Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria in Egypt-Heliopolis-Port Said has jurisdiction over all Latin Catholics in Egypt. Member churches include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the Jesuits in Cleopatra. The city is also the nominal see of the Melkite Greek Catholic titular Patriarchate of Alexandria (generally vested in its leading Patriarch of Antioch) and the actual cathedral see of its Patriarchal territory of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan, which uses the Byzantine Rite, and the nominal see of the Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Alexandria (for all Egypt and Sudan, whose actual cathedral is in Cairo), a suffragan of the Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia, using the Armenian Rite.\nThe Saint Mark Church in Shatby, founded as part of Collège Saint Marc, is multi-denominational and holds liturgies according to Latin Catholic, Coptic Catholic and Coptic Orthodox rites.\nIn antiquity Alexandria was a major centre of the cosmopolitan religious movement called Gnosticism (today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy).\n\nJudaism\nAlexandria's Jewish community declined rapidly following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, after which negative reactions towards Zionism among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city, and elsewhere in Egypt, being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt moved to the newly settled Israel, France, Brazil and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s.  The community once numbered 50,000 but is now estimated at below 50. The most important synagogue in Alexandria is the Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue.\n\nEducation\nColleges and universities\nAlexandria has a number of higher education institutions. Alexandria University is a public university that follows the Egyptian system of higher education. Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its Faculty of Medicine & Faculty of Engineering. In addition, the Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology in New Borg El Arab city is a research university set up in collaboration between the Japanese and Egyptian governments in 2010. The Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for high school, undergraduate level, and postgraduate students. It is considered the most reputable university in Egypt after the AUC American University in Cairo because of its worldwide recognition from board of engineers at UK & ABET in US. Université Senghor is a private French university that focuses on the teaching of humanities, politics and international relations, which mainly recruits students from the African continent. Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT) and Pharos University in Alexandria.\nIn September 2023, The Greek University of Patras announced that it is opening a branch in Alexandria, in a first-of-its-kind move by a Greek higher education institution.  The Greek university of Patras branch will operate two departments, one Greek-speaking and one English-speaking in the subjects of Greek culture, Greek language and Greek philosophy.\n\nSchools\nAlexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by Catholic missionaries include Collège de la Mère de Dieu, Collège Notre Dame de Sion, Collège Saint Marc, Écoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), École Girard, École Saint Gabriel, École Saint-Vincent de Paul, École Saint Joseph, École Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lycée el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Lycée Français d'Alexandrie (École Champollion). It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria. The Italian school is the Istituto \"Don Bosco\".\nEnglish-language schools in Alexandria are the most popular; those in the city include: Riada American School, Riada Language School, Forsan American School, Forsan International School, Alexandria Language School, Future Language School, Future International Schools (Future IGCSE, Future American School and Future German school), Alexandria American School, British School of Alexandria, Egyptian American School, Pioneers Language School, Egyptian English Language School, Princesses Girls' School, Sidi Gaber Language School, Zahran Language School, Taymour English School, Sacred Heart Girls' School, Schutz American School, Victoria College, El Manar Language School for Girls (previously called Scottish School for Girls), Kawmeya Language School, El Nasr Boys' School (previously called British Boys' School), and El Nasr Girls' College (previously called English Girls' College).\nThere are only two German schools in Alexandria which are Deutsche Schule der Borromärinnen (DSB of Saint Charles Borromé) and Neue Deutsche Schule Alexandria, which is run by Frau Sally Hammam.\nThe Montessori educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at Alexandria Montessori.\n\nWomen\nAround the 1890s, twice the percentage of women in Alexandria knew how to read compared to Cairo. As a result, specialist women's publications like al-Fatāh by Hind Nawal, the country's first women's journal, appeared.\n\nTransport\nAirports\nThe city's principal airport is currently Alexandria International Airport, which is located about 25 km (16 mi) away from the city centre, which is now composed of 2 Terminals. Terminal 1 is the old terminal which was opened in February 2010 wherease Terminal 2 is the Brand New Terminal and was inaugurated in 2025.\n\nPort\nAlexandria has four ports; namely the Western Port also known as Alexandria Port, which is the main port of the country that handles about 60% of the country's exports and imports, Dekhela Port west of the Western Port, the Eastern Port which is a yachting harbour, and Abu Qir Port at the northern east of the governorate. It is a commercial port for general cargo and phosphates.\n\nRoads\nAmong the most important are three main roads that run parallel and connect the city center to its eastern parts: Alexandria Corniche (or El-Geish Road), which is approximately 17 km long and connects the Bahary area in the west to the Mandara area in the east; Al-Horreya Road (or Abu Qir Road), about 10 km long, linking the Shallalat area in the west to the Victoria area in the east; and Al-Mahmoudia Axis, which is 23 km long and connects the Qabbari area in the west to the Abis villages in the southeast. In addition to these, there are other major roads such as Fouad Street, considered the oldest street in Alexandria, Malek Hefni Street, Suez Canal Street, Nabi Daniel Street, Port Said Street, Sultan Hussein Street, and the Ring Road. Alexandria also includes several highways that connect it to other cities, such as the Cairo–Alexandria Desert Road, the Cairo–Alexandria Agricultural Road, the International Coastal Road, the Al-Mashir Fouad Abu Zekri Axis, and the Kafoury–Borg El Arab Road.\n\nRail\nAlexandria's intracity commuter rail system extends from Misr Station (Alexandria's primary intercity railway station) to Abu Qir, parallel to the tram line. The commuter line's locomotives operate on diesel, as opposed to the overhead-electric tram.\nAlexandria plays host to two intercity railway stations: the aforementioned Misr Station (in the older Manshia district in the western part of the city) and Sidi Gaber railway station (in the district of Sidi Gaber in the centre of the eastern expansion in which most Alexandrines reside), both of which also serve the commuter rail line. Intercity passenger service is operated by Egyptian National Railways.\n\nTrams\nAn extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa. The network begins at the El Raml district in the west and ends in the Victoria district in the east.\n\nMetro\nConstruction of the Alexandria Metro was due to begin in 2020 at a cost of $1.05 billion.\n\nCulture\nLibraries\nThe Royal Library of Alexandria, in Alexandria, Egypt, was once the largest library in the world. It is generally thought to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC, during the reign of Ptolemy II of Egypt. It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the library complex, the temple of the Muses—the Museion, Greek Μουσείον (from which the Modern English word museum is derived).\nIt has been reasonably established that the library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming). To this day, the details of the destruction (or destructions) remain a lively source of controversy.\nThe Bibliotheca Alexandrina was inaugurated in 2002, near the site of the old Library.\n\nMuseums\nThe Alexandria National Museum was inaugurated 31 December 2003. It is located in a restored Italian style palace in Tariq El Horreya Street (formerly Rue Fouad), near the centre of the city. It contains about 1,800 artifacts that narrate the story of Alexandria and Egypt. Most of these pieces came from other Egyptian museums. The museum is housed in the old Al-Saad Bassili Pasha Palace, who was one of the wealthiest wood merchants in Alexandria. Construction on the site was first undertaken in 1926.\nThe Graeco-Roman Museum was the city's main archeological museum, focused on artifacts from its Greco-Roman period. It was opened in 1892 and was closed in 2005 for extensive renovations and expansion. The museum re-opened to the public in October 2023.\nOther museums in the city include the Cavafy Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, and the Royal Jewelry Museum.\n\nTheaters\nAlexandria Opera House hosts performances of classical music, Arabic music, ballet, and opera.\n\nPoetry\nDuring the Hellenistic period, poets evolving in the court of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (Philiscus of Corcyra, Lycophron, Alexander Aetolus, Sositheus,...) are currently known as the Alexandrian Pleiad.\nIn modern times, Constantine P. Cavafy, a major Greek poet who was born and lived in Alexandria used several themes associated with this city in his work: \"Alexandrian Kings\", \"In Alexandria, 31 B.C.\", \"Myres: Alexandria 340 A.D\", \"Kaisarion\" and \"The God Abandons Antony\". In the latter, Alexandria becomes the symbol of the life whose forthcoming loss must be faced with dignity.\n\nSports\nThe main sport that interests Alexandrians is football, as is the case in the rest of Egypt and Africa. Alexandria Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Alexandria, Egypt. It is currently used mostly for football matches and was used for the 2006 African Cup of Nations. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people. Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the African Cup of Nations in January 2006, which Egypt won. Sea sports such as surfing, jet-skiing and water polo are practiced on a lower scale. The Skateboarding culture in Egypt started in this city. The city is also home to the Alexandria Sporting Club, which is especially known for its basketball team, which traditionally provides the country's national team with key players. The city hosted the AfroBasket, the continent's most prestigious basketball tournament, on four occasions (1970, 1975, 1983, 2003).\nAlexandria has four stadiums:\n\nOther less popular sports like tennis and squash are usually played in private social and sports clubs, like:\n\nAlexandria is also known as the yearly starting point of Cross Egypt Challenge and a huge celebration is conducted the night before the rally starts after all the international participants arrive to the city. Cross Egypt Challenge is an international cross-country motorcycle and scooter rally conducted throughout the most difficult tracks and roads of Egypt.\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nAlexandria is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nAhmed Asmat Abdel-Meguid (1923–2013), Egyptian diplomat\nSoheir Bakhoum (1947–2003), Egyptian numismatist\nConstantine P.

          "summary": "Alexandria is a major city in Egypt. Lying at the western edge of the Nile River Delta, it extends about 40 km (25 mi) along the country's northern coast. It is Egypt's principal seaport, the second largest city after Cairo, and the largest city on the Mediterranean coast. Founded in 331 BC by Alexander the Great, Alexandria is one of the largest and most important cities of antiquity and a leading hub for science, culture, and scholarship. \nNicknamed the \"Bride of the Mediterranean\" and \"Pearl of the Mediterranean Coast\", the city is a popular tourist destination and a major industrial centre. It is the sixth-largest city in the Arab world and in the Middle East, and the eleventh-largest city and urban area in Africa. Alexandria was established originally near an ancient Egyptian settlement named Rhacotis, which later became its Egyptian quarter. The city was made the capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and became the foremost commercial, intellectual, and cultural centre for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity; at one time, it was the most populous city in the ancient world. Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library, the largest in the ancient world; and the Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages.\nAlexandria retained its status as one of the leading cities of the Mediterranean world for almost a millennium, through the period of Roman and Byzantine rule until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, when a new capital was founded at Fustat, now part of Cairo. The city was a major hub of early Christianity and hosted the Patriarchate of Alexandria, one of the leading Christian centres in the Eastern Roman Empire; the modern Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.  \nBy the mid seventh century, Alexandria had already been largely plundered and lost its significance, although it persisted as a trading hub and naval base. From the late 18th century, it was a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world, owing to the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean and Red Seas and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton. Alexandria’s rebirth began in the early 19th century under Muhammad Ali, considered the founder of modern Egypt, who implemented infrastructure projects and modernisation efforts.",

بحوالي 55 كم، على مساحه 2523 كم²، يحدها من الشمال البحر الابيض المتوسط، ومن الجنوب محافظه البحيره وبحيره مريوط حتى الكيلو 71 على طريق القاهره الاسكندريه الصحراوي، ويحدها من جهه الشرق محافظه البحيره وخليج ابو قير، ومن الغرب حتى الكيلو 36.30 على الطريق الساحلي الدولي، ومركز برج العرب.\nتضم مدينه الاسكندريه الكثير من المعالم المميزه، اذ يوجد بها اكبر موانئ مصر البحريه وهو ميناء الاسكندريه الذي يمر به نحو 60% من اجمالي الواردات والصادرات المصريه، وتضم ايضًا مكتبه الاسكندريه الجديده التي تحتوي على اكثر من ثمانيه ملايين كتاب، وتستقبل حوالي 1.5 مليون زائر سنويًا، كما تضم العديد من المتاحف مثل متحف الاسكندريه القومي والمتحف اليوناني الروماني، والمواقع الاثريه مثل قلعه قايتباي وعمود السواري، بلغ عدد سكان مدينه الاسكندريه في 1 يوليو 2017 حوالي 5039975 نسمه، يعمل سكانها في مختلف الانشطه الاقتصاديه، وتنقسم الاسكندريه الى تسعه احياء اداريه هي: حي اول المنتزه، حي ثان المنتزه، حي شرق، حي وسط، حي غرب، حي الجمرك، حي العجمي، حي اول العامريه، وحي ثان العامريه.\nبدا العمل على انشاء الاسكندريه على يد الاسكندر الاكبر سنه 331 ق.م.، عن طريق ردم جزء من المياه يفصل بين جزيره ممتده امام الساحل الرئيسي تدعى \"فاروس\" بها ميناء عتيق، وقريه صغيره تدعى \"راكتوس\" او \"راقوده\"، يحيط بها قرى صغيره اخرى تنتشر كذلك ما بين البحر وبحيره مريوط، واتخذها الاسكندر الاكبر وخلفاؤه عاصمه لمصر لما يقرب من الف سنه، حتى الفتح الاسلامي لمصر على يد عمرو بن العاص سنه 641 م، اشتهرت الاسكندريه عبر التاريخ من خلال العديد من المعالم مثل مكتبه الاسكندريه القديمه والتي كانت تضم ما يزيد عن 700000 مجلّد، وفنار الاسكندريه والتي اعتبرت من عجائب الدنيا السبع، وذلك لارتفاعها الهائل الذي يصل الى حوالي 120 مترًا، وظلت هذه المناره قائمه حتى دُمرت جراء زلزال قوي سنه 1307 م.\nيرى بعض المؤرخين ان اختيار الاسكندر الاكبر لمدينه الاسكندريه كي تكون عاصمه لدولته، استهدى في ذلك بتوجيه معلمه الروحي هوميروس في ملحمه الاوديسه، حيث ذهب تليماخوس ابن اوديسيوس ملك ايثاكا، الى مينلاوس ملك اسبرطه يساله ان كان يعرف شيئا عن مصير والده المختفي، فحكى مينلاوس عن اهوال الحرب وشجاعه ملك ايثاكا وجيشه المفقود، وانه بعدما اضنى التعب جيوشهم، بلغوا شواطئ مصر، عند جزيره فاروس، وهناك كما يقول ملك اسبرطه: «كان في مقدورنا ان نُروى من كوثر هذه البلاد التي تجري من تحتها الانهار».\n\nالتاريخ\nالعصور القديمه\nفي بدايه القرن الرابع قبل الميلاد، لم تكن الاسكندريه سوى قريه صغيره تدعى \"راكتوس\" او \"راقوده\" يحيط بها قرى صغيره، يقول عنها علماء الاثار انها ربما كانت تعدّ موقعًا استراتيجيًا لطرد الاقوام التي قد تهجم من حين الى اخر من الناحيه الغربيه لوادي النيل، او لربما كانت «راكتوس» مجرد قريه صغيره تعتمد على الصيد ليس الا، وعلى امتداد الساحل الرئيسي للقريه توجد جزيره تسمى \"جزيره فاروس\" يوجد بها ميناء يخدم الجزيره والقرى الساحليه معًا، في ذلك الوقت كانت مصر تحت الاحتلال الفارسي منذ سقوط حكم الفراعنه والاسره الثلاثون سنه 343 ق م، ولم تكن مصر الوحيده الواقعه تحت احتلال الفرس، فقد كانت بلاد الشام والعراق واقعه تحت هذا الاحتلال، وفي مقابل قوه الفرس كانت قوه الاغريق في ازدياد سريع، وبدات المواجهه بينهما في ربيع سنه 334 ق.م، واستمرت المعارك بينهما حتى دخل الاسكندر الاكبر مدينه صور ومن ثم الى غزه حتى اتم دخول مصر سنه 333 ق م.\nبعد دخول الاسكندر الاكبر مصر وطرده للفرس منها، استقبله المصريون بالترحاب نظرًا للقسوه التي كانوا يُعاملون بها تحت الاحتلال الفارسي، ولكي يؤكد الاسكندر الاكبر انه جاء الى مصر صديقًا وحليفًا وليس غازيًا مستعمرًا، اتجه لزياره معبد الاله امون اله مصر الاعظم في ذلك الوقت، فذهب الى المعبد في واحه سيوه، واجرى له الكهنه طقوس التبني ليصبح الاسكندر الاكبر ابنًا للاله امون، ولُقب فيما بعد بابن امون،  وفي طريقه الى المعبد مرّ بقريه للصيادين كانت تُسمى «راقوده»، فاعجب بالمكان وقرر ان يبني مدينه تحمل اسمه لتكون نقطه وصل بين مصر واليونان وهي مدينه الاسكندريه (باليونانيه القديمه: Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ κατ' Αἴγυπτον؛ وباليونانيه الحديثه: Αλεξάνδρεια)، وعهد ببنائها الى المهندس دينوقراطيس، والذي شيدها على نمط المدن اليونانيه، ونسقها بحيث تتعامد الشوارع الافقيه على الشوارع الراسيه،  وكذلك انشاء جسر يصل بين الجزيره والقريه اُطلق عليه \"هيبتاستاديون\"، وبعد عده شهور ترك الاسكندر مصر متجهًا نحو الشرق ليكمل باقي فتوحاته، ففتح بلاد فارس، لكن طموحاته لم تتوقف عند هذا الحد بل سار بجيشه حتى وصل الى الهند واسيا الوسطى، وبينما كان الاسكندر هناك فاجاه المرض الذي لم يدم طويلاً حيث داهمه الموت بعد عشره ايام وهو لم يتجاوز الاثنين والثلاثين من عمره.\nاتسمت الاسكندريه في مطلعها بالصبغه العسكريه كمدينه للجند الاغريق، ثم تحولت ايام البطالمه الاغريق الى مدينه ملكيه بحدائقها واعمدتها الرخاميه البيضاء وشوارعها المتسعه،  وتحوّلت في ذلك الحين الى عاصمه لمصر، واصبحت احدى حواضر العلوم والفنون بعد ان شيَد فيها البطالمه عددًا من المعالم الكبرى مثل مكتبه الاسكندريه التي تُعد اول معهد ابحاث حقيقي في التاريخ، وفنار الاسكندريه التي اصبحت احد عجائب الدنيا السبع في العالم القديم، وكانت تطل على البحر وجنوب شرقي الميناء الشرقي الذي كان يطلق عليه الميناء الكبير؛ اذا ما قورن بينه وبين ميناء هيراكليون عند ابو قير على فم احد روافد النيل القديمه التي اندثرت، وحالياً انحسر مصب النيل ليصبح على بعد 20 كيلومتراً من ابوقير عند رشيد.\nخضعت المدينه اسميًا للرومان سنه 80 ق م، وفقًا لرغبه بطليموس العاشر، واستمر الامر على هذا المنوال قرابه قرن من الزمن قبل ان تسقط بيد يوليوس قيصر بعد حصار الاسكندريه (47 ق.م)، عندما استغلت روما النزاع والحرب الاهليه القائمه بين بطليموس الثالث عشر ومستشاريه وشقيقته كليوبترا السابعه، وبعد عده معارك انتصر قيصر وتم قتل اخيها، وبذلك استطاعت كليوباترا الانفراد بحكم مصر، وعلى احد اراء بعض المؤرخين فقد تم حرق مكتبه الاسكندريه الشهيره في ذلك الوقت في صراع يوليوس قيصر مع بطليموس الثالث عشر. سقطت المدينه بيد القائد «اوكتافيوس» الذي اصبح لاحقًا الامبراطور «اغسطس» في 1 اغسطس سنه 30 ق م، بعد معركه الاسكندريه، وبهذا اصبحت مصر ولايه رومانيه، ظلت الاسكندريه اكبر مدينه في الامبراطوريه الرومانيه الواسعه بعد روما العاصمه، واقدم الرومان على عمل العديد من الاصلاحات فيها، فقاموا بتجديد واعاده حفر القناه القديمه التي كانت تربط نهر النيل والبحر الاحمر لخدمه التجاره، وكذلك فقد اعطى الرومان لليهود في الاسكندريه والذين كانوا يمثلون جزءًا اساسيًا من التركيبه السكانيه للمدينه، حريات كثيره وسُمح لهم باداره شئونهم الخاصه.\nغير ان كل ذلك لم يوقف حركات التمرد والتوتر في المدينه والتي وصف احد الكتاب القدماء اهلها بانهم \"الاكثر رغبه في الثوره والقتال من اي قوم اخر\"، فمن اعمال الشغب في الاسكندريه سنه 38 وتمرد اليهود سنه 116، والتوتر المتواصل بين اليهود واليونان على مسائل قديمه، فضلاً عن احتجاج السكندريون بصفه عامه على الحكم الروماني، والذي ادى سنه 215 وعلى اثر زياره الامبراطور الروماني الى الاسكندريه الى قتل ما يزيد عن عشرين الف سكندري بسبب قصيده هجاء قيلت في الرجل، غير ان من اهم اسباب الاضطراب هو ان العالم قد شهد احد اهم الاحداث في التاريخ وهو ميلاد الديانه المسيحيه، والتي تزامنت مع بدايه الحكم الروماني في مصر، وحيث ان الديانه الجديده بدات تجذب الكثير من المصريين وتدعوهم الى نبذ الوثنيه وعباده الله، فقد بدا عصر جديد من الاضطهاد حيث كانت روما تريد فرض عباده الامبراطور وكذلك العبادات الوثنيه على المصريين. ضربت موجه تسونامي هائله المدينه بتاريخ 21 يوليو 365،  جرّاء زلزال وقع بالقرب من جزيره كريت، ونجم عنها خراب ودمار كبيرين.\nاكتسبت المسيحيه قوه كبيره رغم كل النزاعات وذلك في مواجهه ديانه باقي المصريين من الوثنيين وخاصه في عهد الامبراطور ثيودوسيوس الكبير (378-395) الذي اصدر مرسوماً ببطلان العبادات الوثنيه، فعقد بطريرك الاسكندريه ثيوفيلوس (385-412) عزمه على تنفيذ المرسوم الامبراطوري بدقه وحزم وقد عاونه اتباعه وقوات الامبراطور، فتم تدمير عدد من المعابد الوثنيه وتحويل بعضها الاخر الى كنائس مثل معبد سرابيوم المقام للاله سيرابيس وذلك سنه 391 حيث شيدت على اطلاله كنيستان.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nخضعت الاسكندريه للامبراطوريه البيزنطيه بعد انقسام الامبراطوريه الرومانيه الى قسمين غربي روماني وشرقي رومي بيزنطي، وفي القرن السابع الميلادي كانت الامبراطوريه البيزنطيه قد وصلت الى حاله بالغه من الضعف، فشجع ذلك الامبراطوريه الفارسيه الساسانيه في الشرق على الهجوم على ممالكها واحتلال الشام ومصر، فدخل الفرس الاسكندريه ونهبوا المدينه وقتلوا الكثير من اهلها، لكن الحكم الفارسي لم يدم الا بضع سنين حيث استطاع الامبراطور هرقل استرداد ممالكه ورجعت الاسكندريه من جديد تابعه للامبراطوريه البيزنطيه، وقد اراد هرقل تعيين بطريرك قوي في الاسكندريه يسند له الرئاسه السياسيه بجانب سلطته الدينيه ليكون قادر على قهر الاقباط وارغامهم على اتباع مذهب المونوثيليتيه فعين بطريركًا رومانيًا يدعى «كيرس» والمعروف عند مؤرخي العرب باسم «المقوقس»، لتحقيق هذه الغايه، الا انه فشل في ذلك، وخلال هذا العهد كان الاسلام قد برز في شبه الجزيره العربيه واستقطب اعدادًا كبيره من الناس، وكان النبي محمد قد ارسل الى حكام الدول المجاوره رسائل يدعوهم فيها الى الاسلام، وكان المقوقس من ضمن هؤلاء الحكام.\n\nبعد وفاه النبي محمد، خرج العرب المسلمون من شبه الجزيره العربيه لنشر الاسلام في انحاء العالم المعروف، فانطلق عمرو بن العاص من القدس الى مصر، بعد ان شاور الخليفه عمر بن الخطاب، سالكًا الطريق التي سلكها قبله قمبيز والاسكندر الاكبر، واصطدمت القوه العربيه بالروم في مدينه الفرما مدخل مصر الشرقي، فسقطت المدينه بيد عمرو، ثم تبعتها بلبيس، وكان المقوقس عامل الروم على مصر قد تحصن بحصن ازاء جزيره الروضه على نهر النيل، ورابط عمرو في عين شمس، ولما وصلت الامدادات من الخليفه عمر، تقاتل الفريقان في منتصف الطريق بين المعسكرين،  فانهزم المقوقس واحتمى بالحصن، ولمّا ضيّق عمرو عليه الحصار اضطر الى القبول بدفع الجزيه،  وتابع عمرو استيلائه على المدن المصريه ولم يبق الا الاسكندريه عاصمه الديار المصريه وثانيه حواجز الامبراطوريه البيزنطيه، وكان الاسطول البيزنطي يحميها من البحر، ولكن شدّه الغارات البريّه العربيه، وموت هرقل وارتقاء ابنه قسطنطين الثاني عرش الامبراطوريه وكان حديث السن، جعلت الروم يوافقون على شروط الصلح، فجلت قواتهم واسطولهم عن المدينه ودخلها المسلمين فاتحين، واطلقوا الحريه الدينيه للاقباط وامّنوهم على ممتلكاتهم وارواحهم.\n\nولكن بعد مده قصيره من السيطره على المدينه قام البيزنطيون بهجوم مضاد ليستعيدوا المدينه من جديد الا ان عمرو بن العاص استطاع هزيمتهم ودخل الاسكندريه مره اخرى في صيف سنه 646، ورحب الاقباط في الاسكندريه بقياده البطريرك بنيامين الاول بالمسلمين ترحيبًا بالغًا وبذلك فقدت الامبراطوريه البيزنطيه اغنى ولاياتها الى الابد، فقدت الاسكندريه مكانتها السياسيه بعد ذلك بسبب اتخاذ عمرو بن العاص من الفسطاط عاصمه له بدلاً منها، لكنها استمرت الميناء الرئيسي لمصر وابرز مرافئها التجاريه، نشطت حركه التجاره في الاسكندريه خلال العهد الاسلامي، كذلك تم بناء سور جديد للمدينه، ووفد اليها الكثير من العلماء من امثال الامام الشاطبي والحافظ السلفي وابن خلدون وغيرهم الذين اثروا الحركه العلميه للمدينه، ومن المعالم التي تركتها المرحله الاولى للفتح ضريح وجامع ابو الدرداء احد صحابه النبي محمد في منطقه العطارين والذي شارك في فتح مصر.\nتعرضت الاسكندريه لحصار عُرف بحصار الاسكندريه (1174) من جانب الاسطول الصقلي كجزء من الحملات الصليبيه ضد الشرق، الا انه فشل فشل ذريعًا، وتعرضت كذلك لعده زلازل قويه سنه 956 ثم 1303 ثم 1323 ادت الى تحطم فنار الاسكندريه ولم يبق منها سوى الاساس الحجري الذي شيدت عليه قلعه قايتباي في منتصف القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي، كما تعرضت الاسكندريه لهجمات صليبيه كان اخرها في اكتوبر سنه 1365 عانت فيها من اعمال قتل دون تمييز بين مسلم ومسيحي ونهب وضربت المساجد،  الا انه وفي سنه 1480 قام السلطان المملوكي قايتباي ببناء حصن للمدينه لحمايتها في نفس موقع المناره والمعروفه الان بقلعه قايتباي، حيث حظيت الاسكندريه في عهده بعنايه كبيره، وقد هيات الدوله المملوكيه وسائل الراحه لاقامه التجار الاوروبيين في مينائي الاسكندريه ودمياط فبنيت دور الاقامه ووضعت تحت تصرف التجار حتى يعيشوا وفق النمط الذي اعتادوه في بلادهم، وفي وقت لاحق فقدت الاسكندريه الكثير من اهميتها بعد اكتشاف طريق راس الرجاء الصالح في سنه 1498 وتحوّل طريق التجاره الى المحيط الاطلسي بدلاً من البحر الابيض المتوسط، وكذلك بعد جفاف فرع نهر النيل والقناه التي كانت تمد المدينه بالمياه العذبه.\n\nالعصور الحديثه\nخضعت الاسكندريه مع باقي مصر الى الحكم العثماني بعد انتصار السلطان سليم الاول على المماليك في معركه الريدانيه ودخل مصر سنه 1517، شهدت الاسكندريه احداثًا مهمه خلال القرن الثامن عشر تمثلت بالحمله الفرنسيه على مصر ودخول الجنود الفرنسيه بقياده نابليون بونابرت الاسكندريه في اوائل يوليو 1798 بدون مقاومه تُذكر، واعتبرت الدوله العثمانيه احتلال بونابرت لمصر اعتداءً عليها، ووقف الانجليز والروس الى جانب العثمانيين وعرضوا المساعده على الباب العالي لاخراج الفرنسيين من مصر،  وسرعان ما التحمت القوات البريطانيه مع الفرنسيه في معركه الاسكندريه (1801) في معركه ادت لخروج القوات الفرنسيه من مصر،  لتدخل الاسكندريه ومصر بصفه عامه مرحله جديده مليئه بالنهضه في جميع المجالات.\n\nتدين الاسكندريه لمحمد علي باشا بالنهضه حيث انه اعاد للمدينه الحياه بعدّه وسائل ففي سنه 1820 تم الانتهاء من حفر قناه المحموديه لربط الاسكندريه بنهر النيل مما كان له الفضل في انعاش اقتصاد الاسكندريه،  وقد صمم الميناء الغربي كي يكون هو الميناء الرسمي لمصر وتم بناء مناره حديثه عند مدخله، كذلك فان منطقه المنشيه هي بالاساس من تصميم مهندسيه، كما شيد محمد علي عند راس التين مقره المفضل واصبحت الاسكندريه هي مقر قناصل الدول الغربيه مما جعل لها شخصيه اوروبيه حيث جذبت العديد من الفرنسيين واليونانيين واليهود والشوام بسبب الانتعاشه التي حظيت بها المدينه،  كما انشا دار الصناعه البحريه في المدينه والتي يطلق عليها حالياً \"ترسانه الاسكندريه\"، وذلك لتلبيه احتياجات الاسطول المصري على يد المهندس الفرنسي سيريزى بك.\n\nاصبحت الاسكندريه منذ تولي محمد علي الحكم وخلال المائه وخمسين سنه التاليه اهم ميناء في البحر المتوسط ومركزًا مهما للتجاره الخارجيه،  ومقرًا لسكان متعددي الاعراق واللغات والثقافات، وتحت حكم خلفاء محمد علي استمرت الاسكندريه في النمو الاقتصادي، فشهدت في عهد الخديوي اسماعيل تحديداً اهتماماً يُشابه الاهتمام الذي اولاه لتخطيط مدينه القاهره، فانشا بها الشوارع والاحياء الجديده وتمت اناره الاحياء والشوارع بغاز المصابيح بواسطه شركه اجنبيه،  وانشات بها جهه خاصه للاعتناء بتنظيم شوارعها وللقيام باعمال النظافه والصحه والصيانه فيها، ووضعت شبكه للصرف الصحي وتصريف مياه الامطار،  وتم رصف الكثير من شوارع المدينه، وقامت احدى الشركات الاوروبيه بتوصيل المياه العذبه من منطقه المحموديه الى المدينه وتوزيعها بواسطه \"وابور مياه\" الاسكندريه، وانشات في المدينه مباني ضخمه وعمارات سكنيه فخمه في عدد من الاحياء كمنطقه محطه الرمل وكورنيش بحري.\n\nتعرضت الاسكندريه خلال هذه العصر الحديث الى الكثير من الاحداث وخاصه بعد مذبحه الاسكندريه وعند بدايه الاحتلال البريطاني لمصر، حيث قام الاسطول البريطاني بقصف الاسكندريه لمده يومين متواصلين حتى استسلمت المدينه معلنهً بدايه الاحتلال البريطاني لمصر،  والذي دام لسبعين عامًا،  وتحت الاحتلال البريطاني زاد عدد الاجانب وخاصه اليونان الذين اصبحوا يمثلون مركزًا ثقافيًا وماليًا مهم في المدينه،  وتحولت الاسكندريه وقناه السويس الى مواقع استراتيجيه مهمه للقوات البريطانيه،  تعرضت المدينه لاضرار هائله في فتره الحرب العالميه الثانيه،  حيث كانت تقصفها الطائرات الحربيه لدول المحور خصوصًا الايطاليه والالمانيه ما تسبب في دمار ومقتل المئات واعتبرت الاسكندريه اكثر المدن المصريه تضرراً من تلك الحرب،  وبعد نهايه الحرب العالميه الثانيه وقيام حركه 23 يوليو 1952 اُلغيت الملكيه في مصر وغادر الملك فاروق الاول اخر ملوك الاسره العلويه الى المنفى،  وقامت الجمهوريه المصريه على انقاض المملكه بقياده جمال عبد الناصر الذي اعلن من الاسكندريه وبالتحديد في ميدان المنشيه تاميم قناه السويس،  وقد قلت اعداد الجاليات الاجنبيه في الاسكندريه بعد سياسه التاميم التي اتبعها عبد الناصر وكذلك بسبب الحروب التي خاضتها مصر مع اسرائيل، الا انه ما يزال هناك جاليه يونانيه بسيطه في المدينه. وفي 12 سبتمبر 1955 تعرضت الاسكندريه لزلزال بقوه 6.3 على مقياس ريختر، تسبب في في مقتل 18 شخصًا واصابه 89 شخصًا حيث انهار 40 منزلًا بالكامل و420 منزلًا بشكل جزئي، وكان للاسكندريه حضور سياسي حيث استضافت مؤتمر قمه الدول العربيه 1964 والذي اقُيم في قصر المنتزه بحضور اربعه عشر زعيمًا عربيًا.\n\nالمرحله المعاصره\nبعد بدايه سنه 2011 بعشرين دقيقه حدث انفجار كبير امام كنيسه القديسين في منطقه سيدي بشر اثناء الاحتفالات بعيد الميلاد للكنائس الشرقيه، نجم عنه 24 قتيلًا (بينهم مسلمون) كما اصيب 97 شخصًا،  احدثت هذه العمليه صدمه في مصر وفي العالم كله، واتهمت وزاره الداخليه المصريه تنظيم جيش الاسلام الفلسطيني بالمسئوليه عن الحادث،  واحتج كثير من المسيحيين في الشوارع وهتفوا بشعارات ضد نظام حكم مبارك، وانضم بعض المسلمين للاحتجاجات، وحدثت اشتباكات بين الشرطه والمحتجين في الاسكندريه والقاهره.\nبعد نجاح الثوره التونسيه واسقاط نظام الرئيس زين العابدين بن علي،  انتقلت روح الثوره الى مصر، فخرج الالاف من الاشخاص الى شوارع القاهره والاسكندريه وغيرها من المدن المصريه مطالبين بتحسين الوضع المعيشي وخفض الاسعار وتحسين الوضع الاجتماعي للناس. وقد بدات المظاهرات بالاسكندريه بمنطقه المنشيه والعطارين ومحطه الرمل والمنتزه وسيدي جابر. وقد تعاظم شانها وازداد عدد المشاركين بها مع مرور الوقت، مطالبين بتنحي الرئيس حسني مبارك، اسفرت المظاهرات التي بدات في 25 يناير عن تنحي حسني مبارك،  فكان من شان ذلك تهدئه الاوضاع بعض الشيء في المدينه وتفريق المتظاهرين.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالموقع\nتقع مدينه الاسكندريه شمال مصر على ساحل البحر الابيض المتوسط عند التقاء خط العرض 31° 11' 34.6 شمال، وخط الطول 29° 54' 17.5 شرق، وهي عباره عن شريط ساحلي بطول حوالي 55 كم شمال غرب دلتا النيل بدءاً من ابو قير شرقًا وحتى سيدي كرير غربًا، على مساحه 2523 كم²، يحدها من الشمال البحر الابيض المتوسط، ومن الجنوب محافظه البحيره وبحيره مريوط حتى الكيلو 71.5 على طريق القاهره الاسكندريه الصحراوي،  ومن الشرق محافظه البحيره وخليج ابو قير،  ومن الغرب منطقه سيدي كرير حتى الكيلو 36.30 على الطريق الساحلي الدولي ومركز ومدينه برج العرب،  والتربه في مدينه الاسكندريه سهليه منبسطه على ارتفاع -1 من مستوى سطح البحر.\n\nالمناخ\nتتميز الاسكندريه بمناخ معتدل، اذ يسود بها مناخ البحر المتوسط والذي يتميز بصيفه الحار والجاف وشتائه الرطب والمعتدل والممطر، يمتد فصل الشتاء في الاسكندريه عبر شهور ديسمبر، يناير، وفبراير وتترواح درجه الحراره العظمى فيه ما بين 12 و 18 درجه مئويه، وتتعرض الاسكندريه خلال هذا الفصل الى العديد من العواصف الرعديه الشديده والبرد والامطار الغزيره في ظاهره جويه يُطلق عليها \"نوه\"، اما فصل الصيف في الاسكندريه، فيمتد عبر شهور يونيو، يوليو، واغسطس وتترواح درجه الحراره فيه ما بين 25 و 30 درجه مئويه،  ويتميز صيف الاسكندريه بالجفاف وارتفاع نسبه الرطوبه، اما فصلي الربيع والخريف فيعدّان افضل وقت لزياره المدينه، وفيهما لا تزيد درجه الحراره العظمى عن 22 درجه مئويه باستثناء زمن الموجات الخماسينيه التي تصل فيها الحراره في اشهر الربيع الى 32 درجه مئويه احيانًا.\n\nالتخطيط والتقسيم الاداري\nلم يكن تخطيط مدينه الاسكندريه مختلفًا عن السابق بل كان تخطيطاً اشبه بالمدن الاغريقيه القديمه، حيث كان ياخذ شكل شطرنج وهو عباره عن شارعين رئيسيين ومتقاطعين بزاويه قائمه هما شارع «كانوبك» وشارع «سوما» وعرض كل منهما 14 متر، ومنهما تتفرع شوارع جانبيه متوازيه عرضها 7 امتار،  وكان شارع «كانوبك» (شارع فؤاد حاليًا) يربط بوابه القمر من الغرب وبوابه الشمس من الشرق، ويمتد شرقًا ليربط مدينه كانوب (ابو قير)، وكان يتقاطع شارع سوما (شارع النبي دانيال حاليًا) مع شارع كانوبك ويمتد من الشمال للجنوب، وتقاطعهما كان مركز مدينه الاسكندريه.\nاتسعت الاسكندريه في القرن العشرين اتساعًا كبيرًا، وتوسّع العمران بها في الاتجاهين الشرقي والغربي خاصه، بالاضافه الى الاتجاه الجنوبي. بالنسبه للتوسع نحو الجنوب فقد امتد العمران في منطقه محرم بك الى ترعه المحموديه ومنطقه غيط العنب، وحاليًا توسعت المدينه نحو الشرق وساعد على ذلك وجود قطار ابو قير الذي ساعد في نمو العمران الى مناطق سيدي بشر، المندره، والمعموره وصولاً الى ابو قير،  اما التوسع نحو الغرب فشمل مناطق المكس والدخيله والكيلو 21 وصولاً الى سيدي كرير، حتى بلغ طول الشريط الساحلي للاسكندريه حوالي 55 كم،  كما توسعت المدينه جنوبًا حتى وصلت الى مناطق الكافوري والعامريه وحدود محافظه البحيره.\nتنقسم مدينه الاسكندريه حاليًا الى تسعه احياء اداريه هي:\n\nحي اول المنتزه يضم قسم اول المنتزه ويتبعه تسعه شياخات و96 قريه بتوابعها، ومن اهم مناطقه ميامي، سيدي بشر، فيكتوريا، والعوايد.\nحي ثان المنتزه يضم قسم ثان المنتزه، ويتبعه ثمان شياخات، ومن اهم مناطقه العصافره، المعموره، والمندره.\nحي شرق يضم اقسام سيدي جابر، واول الرمل، وثان الرمل، يتبعهم سبعه عشر شياخه، ومن اهم مناطقه كفر عبده، سان ستيفانو، سموحه، باكوس، وبولكلي.\nحي وسط يضم اقسام محرم بك، وباب شرق، والعطارين، يتبعهم خمسه وعشرون شياخه، وثلاثه قرى رئيسيه بتوابعها، ومن اهم مناطقه الشاطبي، ومحطه الرمل، وكوم الدكه.\nحي الجمرك يضم اقسام الجمرك، والمنشيه، واللبان، وميناء الاسكندريه، يتبعهم احدى واربعين شياخه، ويعد اقدم احياء الاسكندريه ومن اهم مناطقه بحري، المنشيه، وراس التين.\nحي غرب يضم قسمي كرموز، ومينا البصل، يتبعهم احدى وعشرون شياخه، ومن اهم مناطقه كرموز، القباري، وبشاير الخير.\nحي العجمي يضم قسم الدخيله، ويتبعه سبعه شياخات، ومن اهم مناطقه البيطاش، الهانوفيل، الدخيله، الكيلو 21.\nحي اول العامريه يضم قسم اول العامريه، ويتبعه سبعه شياخات، ومن اهم مناطقه الكافوري، مرغم، وسيدي كرير.\nحي ثان العامريه يضم قسم ثان العامريه، ويتبعه سته شياخات، ومن اهم مناطقه كينج مريوط، والهواريه.\n\nالسكان\nيعمل سكان الاسكندريه في القطاعات الاقتصاديه المختلفه مثل التجاره، السياحه، الزراعه، الصناعه، الصيد، شركات القطاع الخاص، الوظائف الحكوميه، والاعمال الحره والحرفيه، ويتحدث السكان اللغه العربيه باللهجه السكندريه، حيث تاثرت اللهجه والثقافه السكندريه بوجود عدد كبير من الاجانب في المدينه لان معظم الاجانب مثل الايطاليين واليونانيين كانوا كانوا يفضلون البقاء بالاسكندريه لتمتعها بمناخ حوض البحر المتوسط، ولعل من ابرز الكلمات الموجوده في اللهجه السكندريه كلمه \"مَنَفِيسْتُو\" ويُقصد بها الكتيبات الصغيره جدًا التي يستخدمها التلاميذ واصلها ايطالي، وكلمه \"جُومَه\" والمقصود بها الممحاه واصلها كذلك ايطالي، وايضاً كلمه \"مَسْتِيكَه\" والمقصود بها اللبان او العلك، واصلها ايطالي كذلك، بالاضافه الى ذلك فهناك العديد من احياء المدينه يعود اصل تسميتها لاشخاص اجانب عاشوا بالاسكندريه مثل لوران، جليم، سموحه، بولكلي، كرموز، راغب، ونجت، وفلمنج، كما يتحدث عدد من السكان اللهجه البدويه وهم الافراد المنُحدرين من القبائل العربيه، ويسكن اغلبهم بمناطق غرب الاسكندريه، وايضًا العديد من الوافدين من المحافظات المصريه الاخرى والذين يتحدثون بلهجاتهم الاصليه، تعتبر الاسكندريه من اكثر المدن المصريه كثافه بالسكان نسبه الى اجمالي مساحتها، حيث تبلغ الكثافه السكانيه في المدينه حوالي 1997 نسمه للكيلو متر المربع، وبلغ عدد سكان مدينه الاسكندريه في 1 يوليو 2024 حوالي 5,408,311 نسمه مُقسمين كالتالي:\n\nالثقافه\nتُعقد في الاسكندريه العديد من النشاطات الثقافيه، السياحيه، والسياسيه خاصه بعد اختيارها كعاصمه الكتاب العالميه سنه 2002، وعاصمه الثقافه الاسلاميه لسنه 2008، كما تُنظم المدينه العديد من المهرجانات مثل مهرجان الاسكندريه السينمائي لدول البحر المتوسط، مهرجان الاسكندريه للفيلم القصير، مهرجان الموسيقى العربيه بالاسكندريه، ومهرجان الاسكندريه المسرحي الدولي، كما تنظم مكتبه الاسكندريه العديد من المؤتمرات والفاعليات والمهرجانات في المناسبات المختلفه مثل مؤتمر مكتبه الاسكندريه السنوي للمخطوطات،  مهرجان الصيف الدولي، ومعرض مكتبه الاسكندريه الدولي للكتاب، بالاضافه الى العديد من المهرجانات الاخرى، كما تنتشر المراكز والقصور الثقافيه ومراكز الابداع والمكتبات العامه في مختلف احياء الاسكندريه، ولعل من ابرزها مكتبه الاسكندريه الجديده، مكتبه بلديه الاسكندريه، مكتبه الطفل، قصر التذوق، مركز الحريه للابداع، قصر ثقافه الانفوشي، قصر ثقافه سيدي جابر، قصر ثقافه ابوقير.\n\nالدين\nالاسلام\nيعتنق اغلب السكندريين الاسلام دينًا على منهج اهل السنه والجماعه، وقد انتشر الاسلام في المدينه انتشارًا كبيرًا بعد ان فتحها عمرو بن العاص في القرن السابع حتى طغى على المسيحيه التي كانت سائده قبل هذا، وتتميز الاسكندريه باحتضانها للعديد من المدارس والمنشات الدينيه الاسلاميه وعشرات المساجد الكبيره الاثريه والتي تتركز اغلبها في ميدان المساجد بحي الجمرك.\nومن اشهر المساجد الموجوده الاسكندريه مسجد ابو العباس المرسي، مسجد القائد ابراهيم، مسجد الشيخ ابراهيم، مسجد محمد كريم، مسجد الشيخ الشاطبي، مسجد العطارين، مسجد النبي دانيال، مسجد تربانه، مسجد الشوربجي، مسجد ابي الدرداء، مسجد عبد الرحمن بن هرمز، مسجد حاتم، مسجد سيدي بشر، مسجد المواساه، مسجد احمد يحيى، مسجد البوصيري، بالاضافه الى العديد من المساجد والزوايا المنتشره في كافه احياء المدينه.\n\nالمسيحيه\nبعد ان اعلنت المسيحيه ديانه رسميه للامبراطوريه الرومانيه، اصبحت الاسكندريه مركزًا لبطريركيه من البطريركيات الخمس الكبرى، بعد ان تقرر انشائها في مجمع نيقيه الاول سنه 451، وكان من ضمن الذين كتبوا قانون مجمع نيقه، احد ابناء الكنيسه القبطيه وهو البابا اثناسيوس بابا الاسكندريه الذي استمر على كرسيه لمده 46 عامًا، وتُعدّ مدرسه الاسكندريه المسيحيه اول مدرسه من نوعها في العالم، فبعد نشاتها سنه 190 على يد بنتينوس السكندرى، اصبحت مدرسه الاسكندريه اهم معهد للتعليم الديني في المسيحيه. كثير من الاساقفه البارِزين من عِدَّه انحاء في العالم تعلموا في تلك المدرسه، مثل اثيناغوارس، اكليمندس الاسكندري، ديديموس الضرير، واوريجانوس الذي يُعتبر اب علم اللاهوت.\nيتبع معظم المسيحيين السكندريين الكنيسه القبطيه الارثوذكسيه، وتعتبر الكاتدرائيه المرقسيه الكنيسه الاولى وفيها حسب التقليد راس القديس مارمرقس الرسول، ويتبع بعضًا من المسيحيين الاخرين في المدينه كنيسه الروم الارثوذكس، كما اعتنق عدد من السكان المذهب الكاثوليكي والبروتستانتي خلال القرن التاسع عشر عندما وصلت عدّه بعثات تبشيريه من اوروبا والولايات المتحده الى الشرق وعملت على نشر مذهبها، ويمثل اتباع هذه الكنائس اليوم اقليه مسيحيه في الاسكندريه، ومن اشهر الكنائس القبطيه في المدينه الكاتدرائيه المرقسيه، كاتدرائيه سانت كاترين، كنيسه الانبا تكلاهيمانوت، كنيسه السيده العذراء ومارجرجس، كنيسه القديس سابا، كنيسه القديسين، وبطريركيه الاسكندريه للروم الارثوذكس، والعديد من الكنائس الاخرى في مختلف احياء المدينه.\n\nاليهوديه\nكانت الاسكندريه موطنًا كبيرًا للجاليه اليهوديه، لكنها اليوم في عداد المندثره، خصوصًا بعد ان رحل الكثير من اليهود المصريين والاجانب الى اسرائيل بعد قيامها، او بسبب ترحيل البعض الاخر في عهد الرئيس جمال عبد الناصر اما لاتهامهم بالعمل الجاسوسي لصالح اسرائيل، او بسبب الخوف من اقدامهم على ذلك، كان عدد يهود الاسكندريه في القرن التاسع عشر نحو اربعه الاف يهودي، ووصل عددهم الى ثمانيه عشر الفًا في اوائل القرن العشرين، وارتفع الى اربعين الفًا سنه 1948،  وكان نصف يهود الاسكندريه من اليهود المصريين والنصف الاخر ينقسم الى ثلاثه اقسام اولهم اللادينو من سكان حوض البحر الابيض المتوسط الذين هاجروا من اسبانيا والثلث الثاني من يهود ايطاليا وشرقي اوروبا، والثلث الثالث من يهود المغرب والشرق الاوسط الذين يتحدثون العربيه،  وفي اوائل عقد الثلاثينات من القرن العشرين هاجرت مجموعه من يهود السالونيك، النمسا، المجر، وبولندا الى مصر هربًا من صعود النازيه في المانيا،  ومن اشهر المعالم اليهوديه الباقيه في المدينه اليوم، كنيس الياهو هانبي (بالعبريه: בית הכנסת אליהו הנביא)، الذي يقع في شارع النبي دانيال بوسط المدينه،  وهو مغلق حاليًا ولا يُستخدم في طقوس العباده.\n\nالسياحه والاثار\nالمناطق الاثريه\nالمتاحف\nالقصور\nالخدمات\nالتعليم\nالتعليم قبل الجامعي\n\nتضم الاسكندريه عددًا كبيرًا من المدارس بكافه مراحلها التعليميه رياض الاطفال، الابتدائي، الاعدادي، والثانوي، وبمجالاته العامه والفنيه والازهريه، ويرتبط ذلك بارتفاع المستوى الثقافي والتعليمي للسكان خاصه فيما يتعلق بتعليم الابناء، ففي العام الدراسي 2007 - 2008 بلغ عدد المدارس في نطاق مدينه الاسكندريه حوالي 1766 مدرسه، بها 19657 فصلاً تعليميًا، ويدرس بها حوالي 880337 طالبًا، منهم 428619 من البنات، و 451718 من البنين، ومن اهم مدارس الاسكندريه مدرسه الاسكندريه الثانويه، مدرسه العباسيه الثانويه العسكريه للبنين، كليه سان مارك، مدرسه

          "summary": "الإسْكَنْدَرِيَّة هي العاصمة الثانية لمصر وكانت عاصمتها قديمًا، وهي عاصمة محافظة الإسكندرية وأكبر مدنها، تقع على ساحل البحر الأبيض المتوسط شمال غرب دلتا النيل، ويُقدّر طولها بحوالي 55 كم، على مساحة 2523 كم²، يحدها من الشمال البحر الأبيض المتوسط، ومن الجنوب محافظة البحيرة وبحيرة مريوط حتى الكيلو 71 على طريق القاهرة الإسكندرية الصحراوي، ويحدها من جهة الشرق محافظة البحيرة وخليج أبو قير، ومن الغرب حتى الكيلو 36.30 على الطريق الساحلي الدولي، ومركز برج العرب.\nتضم مدينة الإسكندرية الكثير من المعالم المميزة، إذ يوجد بها أكبر موانئ مصر البحرية وهو ميناء الإسكندرية الذي يمر به نحو 60% من إجمالي الواردات والصادرات المصرية، وتضم أيضًا مكتبة الإسكندرية الجديدة التي تحتوي على أكثر من ثمانية ملايين كتاب، وتستقبل حوالي 1.5 مليون زائر سنويًا، كما تضم العديد من المتاحف مثل متحف الإسكندرية القومي والمتحف اليوناني الروماني، والمواقع الأثرية مثل قلعة قايتباي وعمود السواري، بلغ عدد سكان مدينة الإسكندرية في 1 يوليو 2017 حوالي 5039975 نسمة، يعمل سكانها في مختلف الأنشطة الاقتصادية، وتنقسم الإسكندرية إلى تسعة أحياء إدارية هي: حي أول المنتزة، حي ثان المنتزة، حي شرق، حي وسط، حي غرب، حي الجمرك، حي العجمي، حي أول العامرية، وحي ثان العامرية.\nبدأ العمل على إنشاء الإسكندرية على يد الإسكندر الأكبر سنة 331 ق.م.، عن طريق ردم جزء من المياه يفصل بين جزيرة ممتدة أمام الساحل الرئيسي تدعى \"فاروس\" بها ميناء عتيق، وقرية صغيرة تدعى \"راكتوس\" أو \"راقودة\"، يحيط بها قرى صغيرة أخرى تنتشر كذلك ما بين البحر وبحيرة مريوط، واتخذها الإسكندر الأكبر وخلفاؤه عاصمة لمصر لما يقرب من ألف سنة، حتى الفتح الإسلامي لمصر على يد عمرو بن العاص سنة 641 م، اشتهرت الإسكندرية عبر التاريخ من خلال العديد من المعالم مثل مكتبة الإسكندرية القديمة والتي كانت تضم ما يزيد عن 700000 مجلّد، وفنار الإسكندرية والتي اعتبرت من عجائب الدنيا السبع، وذلك لارتفاعها الهائل الذي يصل إلى حوالي 120 مترًا، وظلت هذه المنارة قائمة حتى دُمرت جراء زلزال قوي سنة 1307 م.\nيرى بعض المؤرخين أن اختيار الإسكندر الأكبر لمدينة الإسكندرية كي تكون عاصمة لدولته، استهدى في ذلك بتوجيه معلمه الروحي هوميروس في ملحمة الأوديسة، حيث ذهب تليماخوس ابن أوديسيوس ملك إيثاكا، إلى مينلاوس ملك إسبرطة يسأله إن كان يعرف شيئا عن مصير والده المختفي، فحكى مينلاوس عن أهوال الحرب وشجاعة ملك إيثاكا وجيشه المفقود، وأنه بعدما أضنى التعب جيوشهم، بلغوا شواطئ مصر، عند جزيرة فاروس، وهناك كما يقول ملك إسبرطة: «كان في مقدورنا أن نُروى من كوثر هذه البلاد التي تجري من تحتها الأنهار».",

Luxor is a major destination for tourism, with its large hotels and resorts, known also for its famous hot air balloons. The city also contains diversified cultural heritage such as temples, churches, and mosques, co-existing side by side. Around 5 million tourists from around the world arrive annually to visit Luxor's attractions, making a significant contribution to the modern city's economy.\nThe city is located between latitudes 25-26 North and 32-33 East. It is about 670 km from the Egyptian capital, Cairo, about 220 km north of Aswan. Luxor covers an area of ​​approximately 416 km², with a populated area of ​​208 km², and its population is estimated at approximately 284,952 in 2023. The nearest seaport to the city is Safaga Port, and the nearest airport is the city's Luxor International Airport.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Luxor derives from the Arabic قصر qaṣr, meaning \"castle\" or \"palace\", in the plural form al-quṣūr (“the palaces\"). It may be equivalent to the Greek and Coptic toponym τὰ Τρία Κάστρα ta tria kastra and ⲡϣⲟⲙⲧ ⲛ̀ⲕⲁⲥⲧⲣⲟⲛ pshomt enkastron respectively, which both mean \"three castles\".\nThe Sahidic Coptic name Pape comes from Demotic Ỉp.t meaning 'the adyton,' which, in turn, is derived from the Egyptian. The Greek forms \"Ἀπις\" and \"Ὠφιεῖον\" originate from the same source. The Egyptian village of Aba al-Waqf shares the same etymology.\n\nThe Greek name is Thebes (Ancient Greek: Θῆβαι) or Diospolis. The Egyptian name of the city is Waset, also known as Nut (Coptic: ⲛⲏ), written as  and .\n\nHistory\nLuxor was the ancient city of Thebes, the capital of Upper Egypt during the New Kingdom, and the city of Amun, later to become the god Amun-Ra. The city was regarded in the ancient Egyptian texts as wAs.t (approximate pronunciation: \"Waset\"), which meant  \"city of the sceptre\", and later in Demotic Egyptian as ta jpt (conventionally pronounced as \"tA ipt\" and meaning \"the shrine/temple\", referring to the jpt-swt, the temple now known by its Arabic name Karnak, meaning \"fortified village\"), which the ancient Greeks adapted as Thebai and the Romans after them as Thebae. Thebes was also known as \"the city of the 100 gates\", sometimes being called \"southern Heliopolis\" ('Iunu-shemaa' in Ancient Egyptian), to distinguish it from the city of Iunu or Heliopolis, the main place of worship for the god Ra in the north. It was also often referred to as niw.t, which simply means \"city\", and was one of only three cities in Egypt for which this noun was used (the other two were Memphis and Heliopolis); it was also called niw.t rst, \"southern city\", as the southernmost of them.\nThe importance of Luxor started as early as the 11th Dynasty, when the community grew into a thriving city. Montuhotep II, who united Egypt after the troubles of the First Intermediate Period, brought stability to the lands as the city grew in stature. The Pharaohs of the New Kingdom in their expeditions to Kush, in today's northern Sudan, and to the lands of Canaan, Phoenicia and Syria saw the city accumulate great wealth and rose to prominence, even on a world scale. Thebes played a major role in expelling the invading forces of the Hyksos from Upper Egypt, and from the time of the 18th Dynasty to the 20th Dynasty, the city had risen as the political, religious and military capital of Ancient Egypt.\nThe city attracted peoples such as the Babylonians, the Mitanni, the Hittites of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), the Canaanites of Ugarit, the Phoenicians of Byblos and Tyre, and the Minoans from the island of Crete. A Hittite prince from Anatolia even came to marry with the widow of Tutankhamun, Ankhesenamun. The political and military importance of the city, however, faded during the Late Period, with Thebes being replaced as political capital by several cities in Northern Egypt, such as Bubastis, Sais and finally Alexandria.\nHowever, as the city of the god Amun-Ra, Thebes remained the religious capital of Egypt until the Greek period. The main god of the city was Amun, who was worshipped together with his wife, the Goddess Mut, and their son Khonsu, the God of the moon. With the rise of Thebes as the foremost city of Egypt, the local god Amun rose in importance as well and became linked to the sun god Ra, thus creating the new 'king of gods' Amun-Ra. His great temple at Karnak, just north of Thebes, was the most important temple of Egypt right until the end of antiquity.\nLater, the city was attacked by Assyrian emperor Ashurbanipal, who installed a new prince on the throne, Psamtik I. The city of Thebes was in ruins and fell in significance. However, Alexander the Great did arrive at the temple of Amun, where the statue of the god was transferred from Karnak during the Opet Festival, the great religious feast. Thebes remained a site of spirituality up to the Christian era, and attracted numerous Christian monks of the Roman Empire who established monasteries amidst several ancient monuments including the temple of Hatshepsut, now called Deir el-Bahri (\"the northern monastery\").\nFollowing the Muslim conquest of Egypt, part of the Luxor Temple was converted from a church to a mosque. This mosque is currently known as the Abu Haggag Mosque today.\nThe 18th century saw an increase of Europeans visiting Luxor, with some publishing their travels and documenting its surroundings, such as Claude Sicard, Granger, Frederick Louis Norden, Richard Pococke, Vivant Denon and others. By the 20th century, Luxor had become a major tourist destination.\n\nArchaeology\nIn April 2018, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of the shrine of god Osiris: Ptah Neb, dating back to the 25th dynasty in the Temple of Karnak. According to archaeologist Essam Nagy, the material remains from the area contained clay pots, the lower part of a sitting statue and part of a stone panel showing an offering table filled with a sheep and a goose which were the symbols of the god Amun.\nOn the same day in November 2018, two different discoveries were announced. One was by the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities that had found a 13th-century tomb on the West Bank belonging to Thaw-Irkhet-If, the overseer of the mummification shrine at the temple of Mut, and his wife. Five months of excavation work until this point had revealed colorful scenes of the family and 1,000 funerary statues or ushabti. The other discovery was of 1000 ushabti and two sarcophagi each containing a mummy in the TT33 complex by a joint team from the IFAO (French Institute of Oriental Archaeology, Cairo, Egypt) and the University of Strasbourg. One of the sarcophagi was opened in private by Egyptian antiquities officials, while the other, of a female 18th Dynasty woman named Thuya, was opened in front of international media.\nIn October 2019, Egyptian archaeologists, headed by Zahi Hawass, revealed an ancient \"industrial area\" used to manufacture decorative artefacts, furniture, and pottery for royal tombs. The site contained a big kiln to fire ceramics and 30 ateliers. According to Zahi Hawass, each atelier had a different aim – some of them were used to make pottery, others used to produce gold artefacts, and others still to churn out furniture. About 75 meters below the valley, several items believed to have adorned wooden royal coffins, such as inlaid beads, silver rings, and gold foil, were unearthed. Some artefacts depicted the wings of deity Horus.\nIn October 2019, the Egyptian archaeological mission unearthed thirty well-preserved wooden coffins (3,000 years old) in front of the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut in El-Assasif Cemetery. The coffins contained mummies of twenty-three adult males, five adult females, and two children, who are believed to be from the middle class. According to Hawass, mummies were decorated with mixed carvings and designs, including scenes from Egyptian gods, hieroglyphs, and the Book of the Dead, a series of spells that allowed the soul to navigate in the afterlife. Some of the coffins had the names of the dead engraved on them.\nOn 8 April 2021, Egyptian archaeologists led by Zahi Hawass found Aten, a 3,400-year-old \"lost golden city\" near Luxor. It is the largest known city from Ancient Egypt to be unearthed to date. The site was said by Betsy Bryan, professor of Egyptology at Johns Hopkins University to be \"the second most important archaeological discovery since the tomb of Tutankhamun\". The site is celebrated by the unearthing crew for showing a glimpse into the ordinary lives of living ancient Egyptians whereas past archaeological discoveries were from tombs and other burial sites. Many artefacts are found alongside the buildings, such as pottery dated back to the reign of Amenhotep III, rings, and everyday working tools. The site is not completely unearthed as of the 10th of April 2021.\nIn February 2025, a joint Egyptian-British archaeological team announced the discovery of the tomb of Thutmose II near Luxor, marking the first identification of a pharaonic royal tomb in over a century since that of Tutankhamun in 1922. Located west of the Valley of the Kings in an area known as Wadi C, the tomb—designated Wadi C-4—was identified through inscriptions on alabaster vessels bearing the names of Thutmose II and his wife, Hatshepsut. The tomb's interior featured fragments of funerary furniture and decorative elements, including blue-painted ceilings with yellow stars and religious texts. However, the site had suffered damage due to ancient flooding, which led to the deterioration of many of its original contents.\nIn May 2025, Egyptian archaeologists uncovered three ancient New Kingdom tombs at the Dra Abu el-Naga necropolis in Luxor, dating back over 3,500 years; the tombs belonged to high-ranking officials identified through inscriptions as Amum-em-Ipet, Baki (a grain silo supervisor), and “S” (a Temple of Amun supervisor, scribe, and northern oasis mayor). Each tomb features typical New Kingdom architectural elements such as courtyards, halls, burial shafts, and wall depictions of banquet scenes and funerary processions, offering new insights into elite burial customs in non‑royal Theban cemeteries.\nIn May 2025, a joint Egyptian–Canadian archaeological mission identified the owner of Kampp 23, a rock-cut tomb located in the El-Asasif necropolis, as Amun Mes, a high-ranking official who served as the mayor of Thebes during the Ramesside period. The tomb featuring a T-shaped layout typical of the 19th–20th Dynasties was first discovered in the 1970s but remained unattributed until recent excavations revealed inscriptions confirming Amun Mes's identity and several of his titles, including tax collector, royal advisor, divine father of Amun, and overseer of quarry expeditions. The team also found evidence of later reuse, such as painted plaster over original reliefs and fragments of ushabti figures.\n\nLandmarks\nWest bank\nGeography\nApproximately 4,000 years ago, a significant alteration in the geography of the Nile River occurred, particularly in the region near modern-day Luxor. This transformation involved the expansion of the floodplain, which increased the availability of arable land. This geographic and environmental shift likely played a crucial role in supporting the agricultural productivity that underpinned the prosperity and stability of ancient Egyptian civilization during that period and over the years.\n\nClimate\nLuxor has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) like the rest of Egypt. Aswan and Luxor have the hottest summer days of any city in Egypt. Aswan and Luxor have nearly the same climate. Luxor is one of the sunniest and driest cities in the world. Average high temperatures are above 40 °C (104 °F) during summer (June, July, August). During the coolest month of the year, average high temperatures remain above 22 °C (71.6 °F) while average low temperatures remain above 5 °C (41 °F).\nThe climate of Luxor has precipitation levels lower than even most other places in the Sahara, with less than 1 mm (0.04 in) of average annual precipitation. The desert city is one of the driest ones in the world, and rainfall does not occur every year. The air in Luxor is more humid than in Aswan, but still very dry. There is an average relative humidity of 39.9%, with a maximum mean of 57% during winter and a minimum mean of 27% during summer.\nThe climate of Luxor is extremely clear, bright, and sunny year-round, in all seasons, with a low seasonal variation, with about 4,000 hours of annual sunshine, very close to the maximum theoretical sunshine duration.\nIn addition, Luxor, Minya, Sohag, Qena, and Asyut have the widest difference of temperatures between days and nights of any city in Egypt, with almost 16 °C (29 °F) difference.\nThe hottest temperature recorded was on May 15, 1991, which was 50 °C (122 °F), and the coldest temperature was on February 6, 1989, which was −1 °C (30 °F).\n\nCoptic Catholic Eparchy\nThe Coptic Catholic (Alexandrian Rite) minority established on November 26, 1895, an Eparchy (Eastern Catholic Diocese) of Luqsor (Luxor) alias Thebes, on territory split off from the Apostolic Vicariate of Egypt. Its episcopal see is St. George cathedral in Luxor.\nIn turn, it lost territory on August 10, 1947, to establish the Eparchy of Assiut and again on 14 September 1981 to establish Sohag.\n\nSuffragan Eparchs of Luxor\nIgnazio Gladès Berzi (March 6, 1896 – died January 29, 1925)\nMarc Khouzam (August 6, 1926 – August 10, 1947), also Apostolic Administrator of Alexandria of the Copts (Egypt) (December 30, 1927 – August 10, 1947); later Coptic Catholic Patriarch of Alexandria (10 August 10, 1947 – died February 2, 1958)\nIsaac Ghattas (June 21, 1949 – May 8, 1967), later Archbishop-Bishop of Minya of the Copts (Egypt) (May 8, 1967 – died June 8, 1977)\nAmba Andraos Ghattas, Lazarists (C.M.) (May 8, 1967 – June 9, 1986), also Apostolic Administrator of Alexandria of the Copts (Egypt) (February 24, 1984 – June 9, 1986), President of Synod of the Catholic Coptic Church (1985 – March 30, 2006), President of Assembly of the Catholic Hierarchy of Egypt (1985 – March 30, 2006), later Coptic Catholic Patriarch of Alexandria (June 23, 1986 – retired March 30, 2006), created Cardinal-Patriarch (February 21, 2001 – died January 20, 2009), also President of Council of Catholic Patriarchs of the East (2003–2006)\nAghnatios Elias Yaacoub, Jesuits (S.J.) (July 15, 1986 – died March 12, 1994), previously Coadjutor Eparch of Assiut of the Copts (Egypt) (May 19, 1983 – July 15, 1986)\nYouhannes Ezzat Zakaria Badir (June 24, 1994 – December 27, 2015), previously Eparch (Bishop) of Ismayliah of the Copts (Egypt) (November 23, 1992 – June 23, 1994)\nEmmanuel (Khaled Ayad) Bishay (April 16, 2016 -\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of Luxor, like that of many other Egyptian cities, is heavily dependent on tourism. Since 1988, Luxor has been the only city that offers hot air balloon rides in Egypt, which is a common activity for tourists. Large numbers of people also work in agriculture, particularly sugarcane. There are also many industries, such as the pottery industry, used in eating, and many other uses.\nThe local economy was hit by the Luxor massacre in 1997, in which a total of 64 people (including 59 visiting tourists) were killed, at the time the worst terrorist attack in Egypt (before the Sharm el-Sheikh terrorist attacks). The massacre reduced tourist numbers for several years. Following the 2011 Arab Spring, tourism to Egypt dropped significantly, again affecting local tourist markets. Nineteen Asian and European tourists died when a hot air balloon crashed early on Tuesday, February 26, 2013, near Luxor following a mid-air gas explosion. It was one of the worst accidents involving tourists in Egypt. The casualties included French, British, Hungarian, Japanese nationals, and nine tourists from Hong Kong.\nTo make up for shortfalls in income, many cultivate their own food. Goat's cheese, pigeons, subsidized and home-baked bread, and homegrown tomatoes are commonplace among the majority of its residents.\n\nTourism development\nA controversial tourism development plan aims to transform Luxor into the biggest, vast open-air museum. The master plan envisions new roads, five-star hotels, glitzy shops, and an IMAX theatre. The main attraction is an 11 million dollar project to unearth and restore the 2.7 kilometres (1.7 miles) long Avenue of Sphinxes that once linked Luxor and Karnak temples. The ancient processional road was built by the pharaoh Amenhotep III and took its final form under Nectanebo I in 400 BCE. Over a thousand sphinx statues lined the road now being excavated, which was covered by silt, homes, mosques, and churches. Excavation started around 2004.\n\nOn 18 April 2019, the Egyptian Government announced the discovery of a previously unopened coffin in Luxor, dated back to 18th dynasty of Upper and Lower Egypt. According to the Minister of Antiquities Khaled al-Anani, it is the biggest rock-cut tomb to be unearthed in the ancient city of Thebes. It is one of the largest, well-preserved tombs ever found near the ancient city of Luxor. On 24 November 2018, this discovery was preceded by the finding of a well-preserved mummy of a woman inside a previously unopened coffin dating back more than 3,000 years.\n\nInfrastructure\nTransport\nLuxor is served by Luxor International Airport.\nA bridge was opened in 1998, a few kilometres upstream of the main town of Luxor, allowing ready land access from the east bank to the west bank. Traditionally, river crossings have been the domain of several ferry services. The so-called 'local ferry' (also known as the 'National Ferry') continues to operate from a landing opposite the Temple of Luxor.\n\nTransport to sites on the west bank is serviced by taxi drivers who often approach ferry passengers. There are also local cars that reach some of the monuments for 2 L.E., although tourists rarely use them. Alternatively, motorboats line both banks of the Nile all day, providing a quicker, but more expensive (50 L.E.) crossing to the other side.\nThe city of Luxor on the east bank has several bus routes used mainly by locals. Tourists often rely on horse carriages, called \"calèches\", for transport or tours around the city. Taxis are plentiful and reasonably priced, and since the government has decreed that taxis older than 20 years will not be relicensed, there are many modern air-conditioned cabs. Recently, new roads have been built in the city to cope with the growth in traffic.\nFor domestic travel along the route of the Nile, a rail service operates several times a day. A morning train and a sleeping train can be taken from the railway station situated around 400 metres (440 yd) from Luxor Temple. The line runs between several major destinations, including Cairo to the north and Aswan to the south.\n\nLuxor University\nLuxor University, founded in 2019, is a non-profit governmental university that provides programs and courses for students.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nLuxor is twinned with:\n\nNotable People\nMeritaten, Egyptian Royal Wife, King's Daughter\nAhmose-Nefertari, Egyptian queen consort\nNeferhotep I, Egyptian pharaoh\nSobekhotep IV, Egyptian king\nAhmed el-Tayeb, Egyptian Islamic scholar\nBahaa Taher (1935–2022), Egyptian novelist\nYusuf Abu al-Haggag (1150–1245), Egyptian Scholar and Saint of Luxor\n\nGallery\nSee also\nCultural tourism in Egypt\nYusuf Abu al-Haggag\nList of cities and towns in Egypt\nList of megalithic sites\nLuxor Las Vegas\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nBell, Lanny. “Luxor Temple and the Cult of the Royal ka.” Journal of Near Eastern Studies 44 (1985): 251–294.\nBongioanni, Alessandro.

الغربي، وهي عاصمه محافظه الاقصر جنوب مصر، تقع بين خطي عرض 25-26 شمالاً، 32-33 شرقاً، وتبعد عن العاصمه المصريه القاهره حوالي 670 كم، وعن شمال مدينه اسوان بحوالي 220 كم، وجنوب مدينه قنا حوالي 56 كم، وعن جنوب غرب مدينه الغردقه بحوالي 280 كم، يحدها من جهه الشمال مركز قوص ومحافظه قنا، ومن الجنوب مركز ادفو ومحافظه اسوان، ومن جهه الشرق محافظه البحر الاحمر، ومن الغرب مركز ارمنت ومحافظه الوادي الجديد، اقرب الموانئ البحريه للمدينه هو ميناء سفاجا، واقرب المطارات اليها هو مطار الاقصر الدولي.\nتبلغ مساحه الاقصر حوالي 416 كم²، والمساحه الماهوله بالسكان هي 208 كم²، ويبلغ عدد سكانها ما يقارب 289,618 نسمه بحسب تقديرات عام 2024، تقسم مدينه الاقصر ادارياً الى خمسه شياخات هي شرعيه العواميه، الكرنك القديم، الكرنك الجديد، القرنه، منشاه العماري، وسته مدن وقرى تابعه لها هي: البياضيه، العديسات بحري، العديسات قبلي، الطود، البغدادي، الحبيل.\n\nالمعالم والتاسيس\nتضم المدينه العديد من المعالم الاثريه الفرعونيه القديمه مقسمه على البرّين الشرقي والغربي للمدينه، يضم البر الشرقي: معبد الاقصر، معبد الكرنك، وطريق الكباش الرابط بين المعبدين، ومتحف الاقصر، اما البر الغربي فيضم: وادي الملوك، معبد الدير البحري، وادي الملكات، دير المدينه، ومعبد الرامسيوم، وتمثالي ممنون.\nيرجع تاسيس مدينه طيبه الى عصر الاسره الرابعه حوالي عام 257 ق.م، وحتى عصر الدوله الوسطى لم تكن طيبه اكثر من مجرد مجموعه من الاكواخ البسيطه المتجاوره، ورغم ذلك كانت تستخدم كمقبره لدفن الاموات، فقد كان يدفن فيها حكام الاقاليمِ منذ عصر الدوله القديمه وما بعدها، ثم اصبحت مدينه طيبه في وقت لاحق عاصمه لمصر في عصر الاسره المصريه الحاديه عشر على يد الفرعون منتوحتب الاول والذي نجح في توحيد البلاد مره اخرى بعد حاله الفوضى التي احلت بمصر في عصر الاضمحلال الاول، وظلت مدينه طيبه عاصمه للدوله المصريه حتى سقوط حكم الفراعنه والاسره الحاديه والثلاثون على يد الفرس 332 ق.م.\n\nالتسميه\nعُرفت الاقصر عبر العصور المختلفه بالعديد من الاسماء، ففي بدايتها كانت تسمى مدينه «وايست»، ثم اطلق عليها الرومان بعد ذلك اسم «طيبه»، واطلق عليها كذلك مدينه \"المائه باب\"، كما وصفها الشاعر الاغريقي هوميروس في الالياذه، وسُميت كذلك باسم «مدينه الشمس»، «مدينه النور»، و«مدينه الصولجان»، وبعد الفتح الاسلامي لمصر، اطلق عليها العرب هذا اسم «الاقصر» وهو جمع الجمع لكلمه قصر حيث ان المدينه كانت تحتوي على الكثير من قصور الفراعنه. يرجع تاسيس مدينه طيبه الى عصر الاسره الرابعه حوالي عام 257 ق.م.\n\nالتاريخ\nطيبه هي مدينه متحفيه فرعونيه قديمه بمصر العليا، واحدى عواصم مصر القديمه ابان المملكتين الوسطى والحديثه ايام قدماء المصريين.\nكانت طيبه (الاقصر اليوم) مركز عباده رع واهتم اغلب فراعنه مصر وعلى الاخص خلال الدوله الحديثه ببناء المعابد فيها لمختلف الهه قدماء المصريين واهمها الاله امون رع.\nتوجد طيبه على الضفه الشرقيه من النيل وبنيت عليها العاصمه والمعابد وقصور الفراعنه وكان لها عمده على مر العصور. كانت تعتبر المعابد خالده لذلك فكانت تبنى من الاحجار الثقيله، ومنها ما كان يسمى بيت المليون سنه وبنيت ايضا من الاحجار، اما قصور الفراعنه وبيوت السكان فكانت تبنى من الطوب اللبن، باعتبارها ليست للابديه. لهذا لم يبقَ من قصور الفراعنه شيئا يذكر في حين بقيت المعابد.\nاعتبر المصريون القدماء طيبه والشاطئ الشرقي من النيل دار الحياه ففيها يسكنون ويعيشون ويذهبون للتعبد في المعابد المجاوره لهم. واعتبروا الغرب دار الممات فكانوا يبنون فيها قبورهم. لذلك نجد وادي الملوك في غرب طيبه، ومعه عدد قليل من المعابد. اما المعابد الكبيره ومن ضمنها الكرنك فكانت في مدينه الاحياء على الضفه الشرقيه للنيل.\nيوجد في العاصمه طيبه حوالي 14 من اهم المعابد المصريه ويطلق حاليا عليها الاقصر. ومن اشهر اثارها على الضفه الشرقيه للنيل بهو الاعمده بالكرنك الذي شهد تعديلات كثيره عبر القرون قام بها فراعنه كثيرون مثل: حتشبسوت وتحتمس الثالث ورمسيس الثاني وغيرهم، كما يوجد بجواره معبد الاقصر الذي بناه رمسيس الثاني. تقع بوابه معبد الكرنك الرئيسيه في نهايه شماله، وامامها كانت توجد مسلتان اخذت احداها لباريس بفرنسا عام 1836م، وهي تزين ميدان «كونكورد» فيها. وفي نهايه شمال المدينه تنتشر مجموعه معابد الكرنك وقد بنيت علي مدى 1500 سنه، لتصبح اكبر منشاه دينيه في العالم. تشتهر ببهو الاعمده الكبيره التي يبلغ عددها 134 عمودا. وبها بحيره اصطناعيه من عهد الفراعنه.\nوبين معبدي الاقصر والكرنك يوجد طريق الكباش ومعابد اخرى. وعلى الضفه الغربيه للنيل كانت ارض الاموات حيث توجد المعابد الجنائزيه ومئات المقابر، ومن اكبر واشهر هذه المعابد الجنائزيه معبد الرامسيوم لرمسيس الثاني ويرجع تاريخه الى الاسره 19 وبانقاضه يوجد تمثال ضخم. كما يوجد على الضفه الغربيه وادي الملوك ووادي الملكات ودير المدينه وهي مدينه العمال الذين كانوا يقومون ببناء مقابر الفراعنه بالقرب منهم.\nويوجد المعبد الجنائزي للملكه حتشبسوت (معبد حتشبسوت) من الاسره 18 في الدير البحري غرب النيل، وهو تحفه فنيه معماريه. وقد شيد خلال اوائل القرن 15 ق.م في مكان متدرج فوق منحدر شاهق. واشهر الاثار في الضفه الغربيه وادي الملوك حيث عثر به على مقبره الملك توت عنخ امون، وبه مقابر تحتمس الثالث ورمسيس الثالث والرابع والخامس وسيتي الاول، ومقبره الملك حور ام

          "content": "Aswan (, also US: ; Arabic: أسوان, romanized: ʾAswān [ʔɑsˈwɑːn]) is a city in Southern Egypt, and is the capital of the Aswan Governorate. The city is among the oldest continuously inhabited cities, with its recorded history spanning over 2,600 years.\nAswan is a busy market and tourist centre located just north of the Aswan Dam on the east bank of the Nile at the first cataract. The city was the southern frontier of Ancient Egypt. Aswan's local quarries supplied granite to many ancient Egyptian monuments, and these quarries are still operating today. The modern city has expanded and includes the formerly separate community on the island of Elephantine. Aswan is considered a global tourist winter destination.\nAswan includes five monuments within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae; these are the Old and Middle Kingdom tombs of Qubbet el-Hawa, the town of Elephantine, the stone quarries and Unfinished Obelisk, the Monastery of St. Simeon and the Fatimid Cemetery. The city's Nubian Museum is an important archaeological center, containing finds from the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia before the Aswan Dam flooded all of Lower Nubia.\nThe city is part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the category of craft and folk art. Aswan joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2017.\n\nOther spellings and variations\nAswan was formerly spelled Assuan or Assouan. Names in other languages include (Arabic: أسوان, romanized: ʾAswān; Ancient Egyptian: Swenett; Coptic: Ⲥⲟⲩⲁⲛ, romanized: Souan; Ancient Greek: Συήνη, romanized: Suēnē; proposed Biblical Hebrew: סְוֵנֵה Sǝwēnê). The Nubians also call the city Dib which means \"fortress, palace\" and is derived from the Old Nubian name ⲇⲡ̅ⲡⲓ.\n\nHistory\nAswan is the ancient city of Swenett, later known as Syene, which in antiquity was the frontier town of Ancient Egypt facing the south. Swenett is supposed to have derived its name from an Egyptian goddess with the same name. This goddess later was identified as Eileithyia by the Greeks and Lucina by the Romans during their occupation of Ancient Egypt because of the similar association of their goddesses with childbirth, and of which the import is \"the opener\". The ancient name of the city also is said to be derived from the Egyptian symbol for \"trade\", or \"market\".\nBecause the Ancient Egyptians oriented themselves toward the origin of the life-giving waters of the Nile in the south, and as Swenett was the southernmost town in the country, Egypt always was conceived to \"open\" or begin at Swenett. The city stood upon a peninsula on the right (east) bank of the Nile, immediately below (and north of) the first cataract of the flowing waters, which extended to it from Philae. Navigation to the delta was possible from this location without encountering a barrier.\nThe stone quarries of ancient Egypt located here were celebrated for their stone, and especially for the granitic rock called syenite. They furnished the colossal statues, obelisks, and monolithic shrines that are found throughout Egypt, including the pyramids; and the traces of the quarrymen who worked (alongside domesticated draft animals) in these 3,000 years ago are still visible in the native rock. They lie on either bank of the Nile, and a road, 6.5 km (4.0 mi) in length, was cut beside them from Syene to Philae.\nSwenett was equally important as a military station and for its position on a trade route. Under every dynasty it was a garrison town; and here tolls and customs were levied on all boats passing southwards and northwards. Around 330, the legion stationed here received a bishop from Alexandria; this later became the Coptic Diocese of Syene. The city is mentioned by numerous ancient writers, including Herodotus, Strabo, Stephanus of Byzantium, Ptolemy, Pliny the Elder, Vitruvius, and it appears on the Antonine Itinerary. It may also be mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel and the Book of Isaiah.\n\nThe Nile is nearly 650 m (0.40 mi) wide above Aswan. From this frontier town to the northern extremity of Egypt, the river flows for more than 1,200 km (750 mi) without bar or cataract. The voyage from Aswan to Alexandria usually took 21 to 28 days in favorable weather.\n\nArchaeological findings\nIn April 2018, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of the head of the bust of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius at the Temple of Kom Ombo during work to protect the site from groundwater.\nIn September 2018, the Egyptian Antiquities Minister Khaled el-Enany announced that a sandstone sphinx statue had been discovered at the temple of Kom Ombo. The statue, measuring approximately 28 cm (11 in) in width and 38 cm (15 in)) in height, probably dates to the Ptolemaic Dynasty.\n\nArchaeologists discovered 35 mummified remains of Egyptians in a tomb in Aswan in 2019. Italian archaeologist Patrizia Piacentini and El-Enany both reported that the tomb, where the remains of ancient men, women and children were found, dates back to the Greco-Roman period between 332 BC and 395 AD. While the findings assumed belonging to a mother and a child were well preserved, others had suffered major destruction. Other than the mummies, artifacts including painted funerary masks, vases of bitumen used in mummification, pottery and wooden figurines were revealed. Thanks to the hieroglyphs on the tomb, it was detected that the tomb belongs to a tradesman named Tjit.\nPiacentini commented \"It's a very important discovery because we have added something to the history of Aswan that was missing. We knew about tombs and necropoli dating back to the second and third millennium, but we didn't know where the people who lived in the last part of the Pharaonic era were. Aswan, on the southern border of Egypt, was also a very important trading city\".\nStan Hendrick, John Coleman Darnell and Maria Gatto in 2012 excavated petroglyphic engravings from Nag el-Hamdulab in Aswan which featured representations of a boat procession, solar symbolism and the earliest depiction of the White Crown with an estimated dating range between 3200BC and 3100BC.\nIn February 2021, archaeologists from the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced significant discoveries at an archaeological site called Shiha Fort in Aswan, namely a Ptolemaic period temple, a Roman fort, an early Coptic church and an inscription in hieratic script. According to Mostafa Waziri, the crumbling temple was decorated with palm leaf carvings and an incomplete sandstone panel that described a Roman emperor. Researcher Abdel Badie states more generally that the church contained ovens used to bake pottery, four rooms, a long hall, stairs, and stone tiles.\nIn July 2024, a joint Egyptian–French archaeological expedition conducting an underwater photographic survey between the old Aswan Dam and the Aswan High Dam uncovered a trove of rock carvings, stelae, inscriptions, and miniature royal images submerged in the Nile near Aswan. The discoveries include representations of New Kingdom pharaohs Amenhotep III and Thutmose IV and Late Period rulers Psamtik II and Apries. Initial research suggests these finds, dating back to the Eighteenth Dynasty (c. 1550–1295 BC) through the Late Period (c. 747–332 BC), may shed new light on shifting political and religious practices in southern Egypt. These artifacts were initially discovered during the Nubian Monuments Rescue Campaign in the 1960s.\nIn June 2025, archaeologists announced the discovery of three Old Kingdom tombs at the Qubbet el-Hawa necropolis. The tombs, dated to the late 6th Dynasty (circa 2300–2100 BCE), consist of vertical shafts, small courtyards, false doors, offering tables, and pottery vessels. Human remains were also recovered, with evidence suggesting that the tombs were later reused during the Middle Kingdom. Although some of the tombs lacked inscriptions, they still exhibited traditional burial architecture and customs, which, according to the archaeologists, may indicate that the individuals buried there had limited economic means.\n\nGeography\nNorthern Tropic boundary\nThe latitude of the city that would become Aswan – located at 24° 5′ 23″ – was an object of great interest to the ancient geographers and mathematicians. They believed that it was seated immediately under the tropic, and that on the day of the summer solstice, a vertically positioned staff cast no shadow. They noted that the sun's disc was reflected in a deep well (or pit) at noon. This statement is only approximately correct. At the summer solstice, the shadow was only 1⁄400 of the staff, and so could scarcely be discerned, and the northern limb of the Sun's disc would be nearly vertical. Around 240 BC, Greek polymath Eratosthenes used this information to calculate Earth's circumference.\n\nClimate\nAswan has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) like the rest of Egypt. Aswan and Luxor have the hottest summer days of any city in Egypt. Aswan is one of the hottest, sunniest and driest cities in the world. Average high temperatures are consistently above 40 °C (104.0 °F) during summer (June, July, August and also September) while average low temperatures remain above 25 °C (77.0 °F). Average high temperatures remain above 23 °C (73.4 °F) during the coldest month of the year while average low temperatures remain above 8 °C (46.4 °F). Summers are very prolonged and extremely hot with blazing sunshine although desert heat is dry. Winters are brief and pleasantly mild, though nights may be cool at times.\nThe climate of Aswan is extremely dry year-round, with less than 1 mm (0.04 in) of average annual precipitation. The desert city is one of the driest ones in the world, and rainfall does not occur every year; in early 2001, the last rain in Aswan had been seven years earlier. When heavy precipitation does occur, as in a November 2021 rain and hail storm, flash flooding can drive scorpions from their lairs to deadly effects. Aswan is one of the least humid cities on the planet, with an average relative humidity of only 26%, with a maximum mean of 42% during winter and a minimum mean of 16% during summer.\nThe weather of Aswan is extremely clear, bright and sunny year-round in all seasons, with low seasonal variation and almost 4,000 hours of annual sunshine – very close to the maximum theoretical sunshine duration. Aswan is one of the sunniest places on Earth.\nThe highest record temperature was 51 °C (124 °F) on July 4, 1918, and the lowest record temperature was −2.4 °C (27.7 °F) on January 6, 1989.\n\nEducation\nIn 2012, the Aswan University was inaugurated, which is headquartered in the city. Aswan is also home to the Aswan Higher Institute of Social Work, which was established in 1975.\n\nTransport\nThe city is crossed by the Cape to Cairo Road, which connects it to Luxor and Cairo to the north, and Abu Simbel and Wadi Halfa to the south. Also important is the Aswan-Berenice highway, which connects with the ports of the Red Sea.\nAswan is linked to Cairo by the Cape to Cairo Railway, which also connects it with Wadi Halfa. The railway is incomplete towards the south.\nOther key transport infrastructures are the Port of Aswan, the largest river port in the region, and Aswan International Airport.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns/Sister cities\nAswan is twinned with:\n\nSonoma, California, United States\nChongqing, China\n\nGallery\nSee also\nReferences\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.

          "content": "Giza (; sometimes spelled Gizah, Gizeh, Geeza, Jiza; Arabic: الجيزة, romanized: al-Jīzah, pronounced [ald͡ʒiːzah], Egyptian Arabic: الجيزة el-Gīza [elˈgiːzæ]) is the third-largest city in Egypt by area after Cairo and Alexandria; and sixteenth-largest city in Africa by population. It is the capital of Giza Governorate with a total population of 4,458,135 as of 2023. It is located on the west bank of the Nile opposite central Cairo, and is a part of the Greater Cairo metropolis. Giza lies less than 30 kilometres (20 miles) north of Memphis (Men-nefer, today the village of Mit Rahina), which was the capital city of the unified Egyptian state during the reign of pharaoh Narmer, roughly 3100 BC.\nGiza is most famous as the location of the Giza Plateau, the site of some of the most impressive ancient monuments in the world, including a complex of ancient Egyptian royal mortuary and sacred structures, among which are the Great Sphinx, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and a number of other large pyramids and temples and the Grand Egyptian Museum. Giza has always been a focal point in Egypt's history due to its location close to Memphis, the ancient pharaonic capital of the Old Kingdom.\n\nDistricts and population\nThe city of Giza is the capital of the Giza Governorate, and is located near the northeast border of this governorate.\n\n2017 population and administrative divisions\nGiza city is a municipal division and capital of Giza governorate with an appointed city head. It comprises nine districts (ahya', singl. hayy) and five new towns (mudun jadidah) administered by the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA).\nThe districts/qisms fully subsume to the city head and according to the 2017 census had 4,872,448 residents:\n\nThe new towns are mostly administered by the national level New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA), with some public services under the jurisdiction of Giza. They are confusingly named madina (city), however they are not administratively incorporated as such where many are formed of a single district or qism. Ones not in the 2017 census as they were not yet incorporated, or inhabited at that time are:\n\nNew 6th of October\nOctober Gardens\nNew Sphinx\nPermanently inhabited Nile islands:\n\nQorsaya Island (Janoub/Giza district)\nDahab Island  (Janoub/Giza district)\nAl-Warraq Island (Al-Warraq district)\n\n2006 population\nThe city's population was reported as 2,681,863 in the 2006 national census, while the governorate had 6,272,571 at the same census, without specifying what the city is. The former figure corresponds to the sum of nine districts/qisms.\n\nGeography and climate\nGiza's most famous landform and archaeological site, the Giza Plateau, holds some major monuments of Egyptian history, and is home to the Great Sphinx. Once thriving with the Nile that flowed right into the Giza Plateau, the pyramids of Giza were built overlooking the ancient Egyptian capital city of Memphis, across the river from modern day Cairo. The Great Pyramid of Giza at one time was advocated (1884) as the location for the Prime Meridian, a reference point used for determining a base longitude.\n\nClimate\nGiza experiences a hot desert like arid climate (Köppen: BWh). Its climate is similar to Cairo, owing to its proximity. Windstorms can be frequent across Egypt in spring, bringing Saharan dust into the city during the months of March and April. High temperatures in winter range from 16 to 20 °C (61 to 68 °F), while nighttime lows drop to below 7 °C (45 °F). In summer, the highs are 40 °C (104 °F), and the lows can drop to about 20 °C (68 °F). Rain is infrequent in Giza; snow is extremely rare.\nUp to August 2013, the highest recorded temperature was 46 °C (115 °F) on 13 June 1965, while the lowest recorded temperature was 2 °C (36 °F) on 8 January 1966.\n\nHistory\nAncient era\nThe area in what is now Giza served as the necropolis of several pharaohs who ruled ancient Egypt, during the second millennium BC. Three of these tombs, in the form of giant pyramids, are what is now the famed Giza pyramid complex, featuring the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Great Sphinx of Giza and the Grand Egyptian Museum.\n\nClassical to medieval era\nAs ancient Egypt passed under several conquests under the Persians, Greeks, Romans and Byzantines, so did the area in what is now Giza. A Byzantine village named Phylake (Greek: Φυλακή) or Terso (Coptic: ϯⲣⲥⲱ, meaning \"the fortress\", now Tersa) was located south of Giza and should not be confused with it.\nEgyptians called the area Tipersis (Bohairic Coptic: ϯⲡⲉⲣⲥⲓⲥ and Sahidic Coptic: ⲧⲡⲉⲣⲥⲓⲥ ⲛ̀ⲃⲁⲃⲩⲗⲱⲛ, lit. 'the Persian (fortress) of Babylon'). Eutychius gives a legend about the city's name and its foundation by Artaxerxes Ochus or Hūš (Arabic: خوش), and Abu Salih says it was found by him at the same time as Qasr ash-Sham, but as older evidence is missing, it is perhaps most likely to have been founded during the Sasanian conquest of Egypt in the early 7th century.\nAs Muslims of the fledgling Islamic caliphate went on with their conquest of Egypt from the Byzantine Empire beginning in 639 AD, three years after their victory at the battle of Yarmouk in 636 AD, they conquered all of the land by the time they captured the city of Alexandria in 641 AD. A year later in 642 AD (year 21 in Islamic calendar), they founded the city of Giza. The exact etymology of its name is unknown. Al-Maqrizi suggested an irregular Arameo-Arabic root meaning \"edge, side\" to be the source. Everett-Heath suggested Ancient Egyptian: r-gs-ḥr \"on the side of the height (pyramid)\". Peust also suggests a Persian etymology of the word from Middle Persian: 𐭣𐭦, romanized: diz, lit. 'fortress, castle', which Persians could have given to the pyramids or a fortress they found in the area.\n\nInfrastructure\nGiza has seen many changes over time. Changes in infrastructure during the different occupations of Egypt by various rulers, including the British in the 18th and early 20th century, focused on the construction of roads, streets, and buildings in the area. Giza is a thriving centre of Egyptian culture and is quite heavily populated, with many facilities and buildings in the current area. Giza saw much attention in particular to its vast amount of ancient Egyptian monuments found on the Giza Plateau, and has astonished thousands of visitors and tourists over the years. Giza's infrastructure saw much attention from both the British government prior to the 1952 coup d'état, as well as the current Egyptian government due to the city's importance in tourism. Giza's St. George Cathedral is the episcopal see of the Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Giza.\nThe city hosts the first zoo on the entire African continent and one of the oldest in the Mediterranean region, the Giza Zoo. In addition, there are several parks, the most famous among them is Orman Park, which means \"Forest Park\" in the Turkish language.\n\nGiza Zoo\nThe Giza Zoo (حديقة حيوان الجيزة, Ḥadīqat Ḥaywān Al-Gīzah), established on March 1, 1891, holds the distinction of being Africa's first zoo and the world's third oldest zoological garden. Located on approximately 80 acres (32 hectares), the zoo was originally designed as a botanical garden and features several historical architectural elements.\n\nHistorical features\nThe zoo contains several notable architectural and cultural landmarks:\n\nA suspension bridge designed by Gustave Eiffel (1875-1879), considered the world's first elevated zoo viewing platform\nThe Japanese Kiosk, constructed in 1924 during King Fuad's reign\nOriginal gates from the Khedive's Palace and Haramlik Palace\nRoads paved with black stone imported from Trieste\nMosaic-decorated footpaths\nA marble island known as Tea Island\n\nAnimal collection\nThe zoo houses approximately 4,000 animals representing over 175 species, including:\n\nLarge mammals: Lions, tigers, giraffes, rhinoceros, hippopotamuses\nPrimates: Various monkey and ape species\nBirds: Native and exotic species including flamingos and rare birds\nReptiles: Including Egyptian cobras and Nile crocodiles\n\nRecent developments\nIn 2023, the Egyptian government announced plans to expand the number of animal species from 71 to 186. The renovation project includes:\n\nCreation of specialized zones: Asia, Africa, America, Family Zone, Safari Trips\nEstablishment of educational centers\nPreservation of historical landmarks\nImprovement of animal enclosures\n\nOperating hours\nSummer (April-September): 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM\nWinter (October-March): 8:30 AM - 4:00 PM\nThe zoo serves multiple functions as a recreational facility, research institute, and cultural landmark.\n\nTransportation\nTransportation in Giza comprises an extensive road network, rail system, subway system, and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles, taxi cabs, privately owned public buses and microbuses.\nGiza shares with Cairo a subway system, officially called the \"Metro (مترو)\", a fast and efficient way of getting around. An extensive road network connects Giza with 6th of October City, Cairo and other cities. There are flyovers and bridges such as the 15th. Traffic in Giza is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded.\nOther means of transport include:\n\nCairo Taxi\nUber (available in Cairo and Giza since 2015)\nCareem (available in Cairo and Giza since 2015)\nSwvl (available in Cairo and Giza since 2017)\nWater taxis (motorized feluccas) available for transport to nearby places along the Nile River\n\nEconomy\nIndustries in Giza include film making Giza in a hub of Egyptian studios like Studio Misr and alahram studio, and movie production companies like Al Sobki productions headed by Mohamed Alsobki.\nA main source of income in Giza is tourism as a home to many historical sites including the Great Pyramid and Pyramid of Djoser and the Grand Egyptian Museum.\nChemicals is an important industry in Giza, Giza Paints & Chemical Industries was established in 1984. \nGiza has many luxury apartment buildings along the Nile, making it a popular place to live.\n\nInternational access\nAccess to the city of Giza, which has its own governorate adjacent to the Governorate of Cairo, is dependent on the Cairo International Airport. Another local airport is found in Giza, called the Imbaba Airport, but recently the Egyptian government has decided to shut down the area and turn it into a cultural or an athletic area.\nSphinx International Airport was opened in 2018 as an alternative to the already congested Cairo International Airport, but also to improve accessibility to the Giza necropolis as well as to the Grand Egyptian Museum.\n\nEducation\nGiza's learning institutions include Cairo University, which was moved to Giza in 1924. The city is a hub of education and educational services not only for Egypt but also for the entire Mediterranean Region. Giza has numerous schools, kindergartens, and institutes of higher learning.\nThe Cairo Japanese School, a Japanese international school, is in Giza. The Deutsche Evangelische Oberschule, a German international school, is located in Dokki in Giza. Previously the Pakistan International School of Cairo had its campus in Giza.\n\nSports\nThe city hosts the second most successful sports club in Egypt and Africa, El Zamalek, which is located in the Meet Okba neighbourhood near the Mohandesin neighbourhood. Beside El Zamalek there are other clubs like El Tersana and Seid Shooting Club which is one of the elite clubs in Egypt.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nGiza is twinned with:\n\n Istanbul, Turkey\n Los Angeles, United States\n\nNotable people\nAmr Abou El Seoud (born 1968), bank CEO\nYehia Chahine, actor\nAhmed El-Ahmar, handball player\nAbdel Halim Ali, football player\nNora Armani, actor and filmmaker of Armenian descent\n\nSee also\nGiza church fire\nList of cities and towns in Egypt\nList of ancient Egyptian sites\nList of megalithic sites\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nDer Manuelian, Peter. 2017.

          "summary": "Giza (; sometimes spelled Gizah, Gizeh, Geeza, Jiza; Arabic: الجيزة, romanized: al-Jīzah, pronounced [ald͡ʒiːzah], Egyptian Arabic: الجيزة el-Gīza [elˈgiːzæ]) is the third-largest city in Egypt by area after Cairo and Alexandria; and sixteenth-largest city in Africa by population. It is the capital of Giza Governorate with a total population of 4,458,135 as of 2023. It is located on the west bank of the Nile opposite central Cairo, and is a part of the Greater Cairo metropolis. Giza lies less than 30 kilometres (20 miles) north of Memphis (Men-nefer, today the village of Mit Rahina), which was the capital city of the unified Egyptian state during the reign of pharaoh Narmer, roughly 3100 BC.\nGiza is most famous as the location of the Giza Plateau, the site of some of the most impressive ancient monuments in the world, including a complex of ancient Egyptian royal mortuary and sacred structures, among which are the Great Sphinx, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and a number of other large pyramids and temples and the Grand Egyptian Museum. Giza has always been a focal point in Egypt's history due to its location close to Memphis, the ancient pharaonic capital of the Old Kingdom.",

          "content": "Faiyum ( fy-YOOM; Arabic: الفيوم, romanized: el-Fayyūm, locally [elfæjˈjuːm]) is a city in Middle Egypt. Located 100 kilometres (62 miles) southwest of Cairo, in the Faiyum Oasis, it is the capital of the modern Faiyum Governorate. It is one of Egypt's oldest cities due to its strategic location.\n\nName and etymology\nOriginally founded by the ancient Egyptians as Shedet, its current name in English is also spelled as Fayum, Faiyum or al-Faiyūm. Faiyum was also previously officially named Madīnat al-Faiyūm (Arabic for The City of Faiyum). The name Faiyum (and its spelling variations) may also refer to the Faiyum Oasis, although it is commonly used by Egyptians today to refer to the city.\nThe modern name of the city comes from Coptic  ̀Ⲫⲓⲟⲙ /Ⲡⲉⲓⲟⲙ epʰiom/peiom (whence also the personal name Ⲡⲁⲓⲟⲙ payom), meaning the Sea or the Lake, which in turn comes from late Egyptian pꜣ-ym of the same meaning, a reference to the nearby Lake Moeris; the extinct elephant ancestor Phiomia was named after it.\n\nAncient history\nArchaeological evidence has found occupations around the Faiyum dating back to at least the Epipalaeolithic. Middle Holocene occupations of the area are most widely studied on the north shore of Lake Moeris, where Gertrude Caton Thompson and Elinor Wight Gardner did a number of excavations of Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic sites, as well as a general survey of the area. Recently the area has been further investigated by a team from the UCLA/RUG/UOA Fayum Project.\nAccording to Roger S. Bagnall, habitation began in the fifth millennium BC and a settlement was established by the Old Kingdom (c. 2685–2180 BC) called Shedet (Medinet el-Fayyum). It was the most significant centre of the cult of the crocodile god Sobek (borrowed from the Demotic pronunciation as Koine Greek: Σοῦχος Soûkhos, and then into Latin as Suchus). In consequence, the Greeks called it \"Crocodile City\" (Koine Greek: Κροκοδειλόπολις Krokodeilópolis), which was borrowed into Latin as Crocodīlopolis. The city worshipped a tamed sacred crocodile called, in Koine, Petsuchos, \"the Son of Soukhos\", that was adorned with gold and gem pendants. The Petsoukhos lived in a special temple pond and was fed by the priests with food provided by visitors. When Petsuchos died, it was replaced by another.\n\nUnder the Ptolemaic Kingdom, the city was called Ptolemais Euergétis (Koine Greek: Πτολεμαῒς Εὐεργέτις) until Ptolemy II Philadelphus (309–246 BC) renamed the city Arsinoë and the whole nome after the name of his sister-wife Arsinoe II (316–270 or 268), who was deified after her death as part of the Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great, the official religion of the kingdom. Ptolemy II Philadelphus also established a town at the edge of Faiyum named Philadelphia. It was laid out in a regular grid plan to resemble a typical Greek city, with private dwellings, palaces, baths and a theatre.\nUnder the Roman Empire, Arsinoë became part of the province of Arcadia Aegypti. To distinguish it from other cities of the same name, it was called \"Arsinoë in Arcadia\".\nWith the arrival of Christianity, Arsinoë became the seat of a bishopric, a suffragan of Oxyrhynchus, the capital of the province and the metropolitan see. Michel Le Quien gives the names of several bishops of Arsinoë, nearly all of them associated with one heresy or another.\nThe Catholic Church, considering Arsinoë in Arcadia to be no longer a residential bishopric, lists it as a titular see.\nFayyum was the seat of Shahralanyozan, governor of Sasanian Egypt (619–629).\nThe 10th-century Bible exegete, Saadia Gaon, thought el-Fayyum to have actually been the biblical city of Pithom, mentioned in Exodus 1:11.\nAround 1245 CE, the region became the subject of the most detailed government survey to survive from the medieval Arab world, conducted by Abū ‘Amr ‘Uthman Ibn al-Nābulusī.\n\nFaiyum mummy portraits\nFaiyum is the source of some famous death masks or mummy portraits painted during the Roman occupation of the area. The Egyptians continued their practice of burying their dead, despite the Roman preference for cremation. While under the control of the Roman Empire, Egyptian death masks were painted on wood in a pigmented wax technique called encaustic—the Faiyum mummy portraits represent this technique. While previously believed to represent Greek settlers in Egypt, modern studies conclude that the Faiyum portraits instead represent mainly native Egyptians (source needed), reflecting the complex synthesis of the predominant Egyptian culture and that of the elite Greek minority in the city.\n\nThe Zenon Papyri\nThe construction of the settlement of Philadelphia under Ptolemy II Philadelphus was recorded in detail by a 3rd-century BC Greek public official named Zeno (or Zenon, Greek: Ζήνων). Zeno, a native of Kaunos in lower Asia Minor, came to Faiyum to work as private secretary to Apollonius, the finance minister to Ptolemy II Philadelphus (and later to Ptolemy III Euergetes). During his employment, Zeno wrote detailed descriptions of the construction of theatres, gymnasiums, palaces and baths in the 250s and 240s BC, as well as making copious written records of various legal and financial transactions between citizens.\nDuring the winter of 1914–1915, a cache of over 2,000 papyrus documents was uncovered by Egyptian agricultural labourers who were digging for sebakh near Kôm el-Kharaba el-Kebir. Upon examination by Egyptology scholars, these documents were found to be records written by Zeno in Greek and Demotic. These papyri, now referred to as the Zenon Archive or the Zenon Papyri, have provided historians with a detailed record of 3rd-century BC Philadelphia society and economy. The discovery site was identified as the former location of ancient Philadelphia. Today, the precise location of the town is unknown, although archaeologists have identified two sites in north-east Faiyum as the possible location for Philadelphia.\n\nModern city\nFaiyum has several large bazaars, mosques, baths and a much-frequented weekly market. The canal called Bahr Yussef runs through the city, its banks lined with houses. There are two bridges over the river: one of three arches, which carries the main street and bazaar, and one of two arches, over which is built the Qaitbay mosque, a gift from his wife to honor the Mamluk Sultan in Fayoum. Mounds north of the city mark the site of Arsinoe, known to the ancient Greeks as Crocodilopolis, where in ancient times the sacred crocodile kept in Lake Moeris was worshipped.\nThe center of the city is on the canal, with four waterwheels which were adopted by the governorate of Fayoum as its symbol; their chariots and bazaars are easy to spot. The city is home of the football club Misr Lel Makkasa SC, that play in the Egyptian Second Division.\n\nMain sights\nThe population of Faiyum Governorate is 4,164,914.\nThe Hanging Mosque, built when the Ottomans ruled Egypt by prince Marawan bin Hatem\nHawara, an archeological site 27 km (17 mi) from the city\nLahun Pyramids, 4 km (2 mi) outside the city\nQaitbay Mosque, in the city; built by the wife of the Mamluk Sultan Qaitbay\nQasr Qarun, 44 km (27 mi) from the city\nWadi Elrayan or Wadi Rayan, the largest waterfalls in Egypt, around 50 km (31 mi) from the city\nWadi Al-Hitan or Valley of whales, a paleontological site in the Al Fayyum Governorate, some 150 km (93 mi) southwest of Cairo.

          "title": "Port Said",
          "content": "Port Said ( sah-EED, Arabic: بورسعيد, romanized: Bōrsaʿīd, pronounced [boɾsæˈʕiːd, poɾ-]) is a port city that lies in northeast Egypt extending about 30 km (19 mi) along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, straddling the west bank of the northern mouth of the Suez Canal. The city is the capital of the Port Said Governorate and it forms the majority of the governorate, where its seven districts comprise seven of the governorate's eight regions. At the beginning of 2023 it had a population of 680,375 people.\nThe city was established in 1859 during the building of the Suez Canal. There are numerous old houses with grand balconies on all floors, giving the city a distinctive look. Port Said's twin city is Port Fuad, which lies on the eastern bank of the Suez Canal. The two cities coexist, to the extent that there is hardly any town centre in Port Fuad. The cities are connected by free ferries running all through the day, and together they form a metropolitan area with over a million residents that extends both on the African and the Asian sides of the Suez Canal.\nPort Said acted as a global city since its establishment and flourished particularly during the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century when it was inhabited by various nationalities and religions. Most of them were from Mediterranean countries, and they coexisted in tolerance, forming a cosmopolitan community. Referring to this fact, Rudyard Kipling once said, \"If you truly wish to find someone you have known and who travels, there are two points on the globe you have but to sit and wait, sooner or later your man will come there: the docks of London and Port Said\". Port Said is an important city in Egypt for trade and business, due to its location on the coastal region.\n\nName\nThe name of Port Said first appeared in 1855. It was chosen by an international committee composed of the UK, France, the Russian Empire, Austria, Spain and Piedmont. It is a compound name which composed of two parts: the French word port (marine harbour) and Said (the name of the ruler of Egypt at that time), who granted Ferdinand de Lesseps the concession to dig the Suez Canal. Urbanized residents pronounce the name [boɾsæˈʕiːd] or [poɾsæˈʕiːd], while unurbanized residents pronounce it [bɔɾsaˈʕɛˑd].\nIn Ancient Greek, the city was called Πηλούσιον (Pēloúsion).\n\nHistory\nFounding (1859)\nPort Said was founded by Sa'id of Egypt on Easter Monday, 25 April 1859, when Ferdinand de Lesseps gave the first symbolic swing of the pickaxe to signal the beginning of construction. The first problem encountered was the difficulty for ships to drop anchor nearby. Luckily, a single rocky outcrop flush with the shoreline was discovered a few hundred meters away. Equipped with a wooden wharf, it served as a mooring berth for the boats. Soon after, a wooden jetty was built, connecting the departure islet, as it quickly became known, to the beach. This rock could be considered the heart of the developing city, and it was on this highly symbolic site, forty years later, that a monument to de Lesseps was erected.\nThere were no local resources here. Everything Port Said needed had to be imported: wood, stone, supplies, machinery, equipment, housing, food and even water. Giant water storage containers were erected to supply fresh water until the Sweet Water Canal could be completed. One of the most pressing problems was the lack of stone. Early buildings were often imported in kit form and made great use of wood. A newly developed technique was used to construct the jetties called conglomerate concrete or \"Beton Coignet\", which was named after its inventor François Coignet. Blocks of concrete were sunk into the sea to be the foundations of the jetties. Still more innovative was the use of the same concrete for the lighthouse of Port Said, the only original building still standing in Port Said.\nIn 1859 the first 150 laborers camped in tents around a wooden shed. A year later, the number of inhabitants had risen to 2000 – with the European contingent housed in wooden bungalows imported from northern Europe. By 1869, when the canal opened, the permanent population had reached 10,000. The European district, clustered around the waterfront, was separated from the Arab district, Gemalia, 400 m (1,300 ft) to the west, by a wide strip of sandy beach where a tongue of Lake Manzala reached towards the sea. This inlet soon dried out and was replaced by buildings; over time there was no division between the European and Arab quarters.\nSince its establishment, Port Said played a significant role in Egyptian history. The British entered Egypt through the city in 1882, starting their occupation of Egypt.\n\nThriving international port and city (1902–1945)\nAt the start of the twentieth century, two things happened to change Port Said: in 1902, Egyptian cotton from Mataria started to be exported via Port Said; and in 1904 a standard gauge railway opened to Cairo. The result was to attract a large commercial community and to raise its social status. In particular a sizable Greek community grew up. In 1907, the quickly growing city had about 50,000 inhabitants, among whom were 11,000 Europeans \"of all nations\". During the First World War, Port Said became home to an important Allied hospital. Due to the strategic location of Port Said intersecting Europe, Africa and Asia, thousands of men were sent to this hospital. This included soldiers wounded as a result from the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. Following the end of the World War I, the directors of the Suez Canal Company decided to create a new city on the Asian bank, building 300 houses for its labourers and functionaries. Port Fouad was designed by the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The houses follow the French model. The new city was founded in December 1926.\nSince its foundation people of all nationalities and religions had been moving to the city and each community brought in its own customs, cuisine, religion and architecture. By the late 1920s the population numbered over 100,000 people. In the 1930s for example there were elegant public buildings designed by Italian architects. The old Arab Quarter was swallowed up into the thriving city. Port Said by now was a thriving, bustling international port with a multi-national population: Jewish merchants, Egyptian shopkeepers, Greek photographers, Italian architects, Swiss hoteliers, Maltese administrators, Scottish engineers, French bankers and diplomats from all around the world. All lived and worked alongside the large local Egyptian community. And always passing through were international travelers to and from Africa, India and the Far East. Intermarriage between French, Italian and Maltese was particularly common, resulting in a local Latin and Catholic community like those of Alexandria and Cairo. French was the common language of the European and non-Arab population, and often the first language of children born to parents from different communities. Italian was also widely spoken and was the mother tongue of part of the Maltese community, since the ancestors of the latter had come to Egypt before the Anglicization of Malta in the 1920s. Multilingualism was a characteristic of the foreign population of Port Said, with most people continuing to speak community languages as well as the common French.\nIn 1936 a treaty was signed between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Egypt called the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. It stipulated the British pledge to withdraw all their troops from Egypt, except those necessary to protect the Suez Canal and its surroundings.\n\nRevolution, end of British occupation (1946–present)\nFollowing World War II, Egypt denounced the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, leading to skirmishes with British troops guarding the Suez Canal in 1951.\nThe Egyptian Revolution of 1952 led to the toppling of King Farouk. On 26 July 1956, President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the Suez Canal Company. The nationalisation escalated tensions with Britain and France, who colluded with Israel to invade Egypt, the invasion known in Egypt as the tripartite aggression or the Suez Crisis. On 6 November 1956, British troops violently landed in Port Said while firing on the Egyptian military. Port Said next was bombed by the British, to terrorise the civilians, of whom hundreds died. There was also heavy fighting in the streets with again many civilian casualties, and the resulting fires destroyed much of the city.\nThe withdrawal of the last soldier of foreign troops was on 23 December 1956. Since then, this day was chosen as Port Said's national day. It is widely celebrated annually in Port Said. The French-speaking European community had begun to emigrate to Europe, Australia, South Africa and elsewhere in 1946 and most of the remainder left Egypt in the wake of the Suez Crisis, paralleling the contemporary exodus of French-speaking Europeans from Tunisia. Most of the Greek community was also expelled or left the town under the rule of Gamal Abdel Nasser.\nAfter the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, also called the Six-Day War, the Suez Canal was closed by an Egyptian blockade until 5 June 1975, and the residents of Port Said were evacuated by the Egyptian government to prepare for the Yom Kippur War (1973).\nThe city was re-inhabited after the war and the reopening of the Canal. In 1976, Port Said was declared a duty-free port, attracting people from all over Egypt. Now the population of the city is 794,720.\n\nEconomy\nPort Said has been ranked the second among the Egyptian cities according to the Human Development Index in 2009 and 2010; the economic base of the city is fishing and industries, like chemicals, ultra-processed food, and cigarettes. Port Said is also an important harbour for exports of Egyptian products like cotton and rice, and additionally a fueling station for ships that pass through the Suez Canal. It thrives on being a duty-free port, as well as a tourist resort especially during summer. It is home to the Lighthouse of Port Said (the first building in the world built from reinforced concrete).\nDue to its excellent geographic location, Port Said is designed to attract logistics start ups along with import and export businesses.\nIn 2019, the city witnessed the construction of the New Suez Canal, led by the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\nEast Port Said Industrial Zone\nThe government provides a number of incentives to investors in the scheme including zero tax and duties on tools, machines and raw materials related to the production of goods for export.\n\nGeography\nClimate\nPort Said has a hot desert climate (BWh) according to Köppen climate classification, but blowing winds from the Mediterranean Sea greatly moderates the temperatures, typical to the northern coast of Egypt, making its summers moderately hot and humid while its winters mild and moderately wet when sleet and hail are also common, yet less common than in Alexandria because Port Said is drier. January and February are the coolest months while the hottest are July and August.\nThe highest record temperature was 44 °C (111 °F), recorded on 20 June 1988, while the lowest record temperature was 0 °C (32 °F), recorded on 25 December 1979.\nPort Said, Kosseir, Ras El Bar, Baltim, Damietta and Alexandria have the least temperature variation in Egypt, additionally, Mersa Matruh and Port Said have the coolest summer days of any other cities or resorts, although not significantly cooler than other northern coastal places.\n\nMunicipal divisions and demographics\nModern Port Said is divided into seven districts:\n\nSouth District\nFlowers Distric\nEl-Dawahi District:\nEast District\nEl-Manakh District\nEl-Arab District\nWest District\nPort Said's districts are further subdivided in to eight qism (police ward) which had a total estimated population as of January 2023 of 680,375 people:\n\nSquares\nManshiyya square, in East district\nMartyrs square, in East district\nGovernorate Square, in East district\nStadium square, in El-Manakh district\nVolgograd square, in El-Manakh district\nBizerte square, in Flowers district\nFlowers square, in Flowers district\nLiberty square, in Port Fouad city\n\nRecreational\nFerial garden\nLiberty garden\nMontaza garden\nHope garden\nEl-Farma garden\nLiberty garden\nSaad Zaghloul garden\nRestaurants complex\n\nEducation\nColleges and universities\nPort Said has a number of higher education institutions.

          "summary": "Port Said ( sah-EED, Arabic: بورسعيد, romanized: Bōrsaʿīd, pronounced [boɾsæˈʕiːd, poɾ-]) is a port city that lies in northeast Egypt extending about 30 km (19 mi) along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, straddling the west bank of the northern mouth of the Suez Canal. The city is the capital of the Port Said Governorate and it forms the majority of the governorate, where its seven districts comprise seven of the governorate's eight regions. At the beginning of 2023 it had a population of 680,375 people.\nThe city was established in 1859 during the building of the Suez Canal. There are numerous old houses with grand balconies on all floors, giving the city a distinctive look. Port Said's twin city is Port Fuad, which lies on the eastern bank of the Suez Canal. The two cities coexist, to the extent that there is hardly any town centre in Port Fuad. The cities are connected by free ferries running all through the day, and together they form a metropolitan area with over a million residents that extends both on the African and the Asian sides of the Suez Canal.\nPort Said acted as a global city since its establishment and flourished particularly during the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century when it was inhabited by various nationalities and religions. Most of them were from Mediterranean countries, and they coexisted in tolerance, forming a cosmopolitan community. Referring to this fact, Rudyard Kipling once said, \"If you truly wish to find someone you have known and who travels, there are two points on the globe you have but to sit and wait, sooner or later your man will come there: the docks of London and Port Said\". Port Said is an important city in Egypt for trade and business, due to its location on the coastal region.",

It is located 240 km (150 mi) west of Alexandria and 222 km (138 mi) east of Sallum on the main highway from the Nile Delta to the Libyan border. The city is also accessible from the south via another highway running through the Western Desert towards Siwa Oasis and Bahariya Oasis.\nMersa Matruh was a major grain port under the Romans and a military base of the British Empire. During World War II, several battles were fought around its environs as the Italo-German Panzer Army Africa attempted to capture the port. It fell to the Axis during the Battle of Mersa Matruh but was recaptured following the Second Battle of El Alamein.\nMersa Matruh is served by Mersa Matruh International Airport. The city features soft white sand beaches and calm transparent waters; the bay is protected from the high seas by a series of rocks forming a natural breakwater, with a small opening to allow access for light vessels.\n\nHistory\nMersa Matruh began as a small fishing town but was important enough to host an Egyptian temple under Ramesses II c. 1200 BC. It prospered as the port for the 8th-century BC oracle of Amun Ra at the Siwa Oasis. \nIt became known as Ammonia (Ancient Greek: Ἀμμωνία, Ammōnía) after the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great of Macedon in the 4th century BC. Under the Ptolemaic dynasty and Romans, it was also known as Paraetonium (Koine Greek: Παραιτόνιον, Paraitónion; Coptic: ⲧⲡⲁⲣⲁⲧⲟⲛⲓⲟⲛ, Tparatonion). It served as a major transit port for Egyptian grain to Rome. Ovid wrote that its patron goddess during his era was Isis.\nThe city was Christianized by the 6th century, when a chapel was built in the Byzantine style.\nAfter the 7th-century conquest of Egypt by the Caliphate, it became known as Baritun (Arabic: البارتون, al-Bāritūn). The city also bore other names from at least the beginning of the 20th century: Berek Marsa, Port Mhaddra (Mithr), and Port Bardiah.\nDuring World War II, the British Army's Baggush Box was located to the east of the city. Starting with the completion of an extension from the previous railhead at Fuka in February 1936, Mersa Matruh was the terminus for a single-track railway, which passed through El Alamein. Mersa Matruh served as a vital British military base during World War II and was a major objective of Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps, which captured it during the Battle of Mersa Matruh.\nDuring the Arab Spring in early 2011, protests broke out in the city. On the evening of 2 October 2023, during the lead up to the 2023 Egyptian presidential election, a Nation's Future Party (Mostakbal El-Watan) rally in support of Abdel Fattah El-Sisi turned into Anti-Sisi protests with protesters burning photos of El-Sisi and chanting chants against him.\n\nGeography\nClimate\nMersa Matruh has a dry-summer hot desert climate (BWhs) according to Köppen climate classification, but winds blowing from the Mediterranean Sea greatly moderate the temperature, making its summers moderately hot and humid while its winters are mild and moderately wet. Summers are sunny and see little rainfall, while in the colder months, there is some rain and cloud cover. Sleet and hail are common in winter.\nMersa Matruh and Port Said have the coolest summer days of all Egyptian cities and resorts, although not significantly cooler than other northern coastal places.

          "content": "Ismailia (Arabic: الإسماعيلية al-Ismāʻīlīyah, Egyptian Arabic: [lesmæʕiˈlejjæ]) is a city in north-eastern Egypt. Situated on the west bank of the Suez Canal, it is the capital of the Ismailia Governorate. The city had an estimated population of 450,388 in 2023. It is located approximately halfway between Port Said to the north and Suez to the south. The Canal widens at that point to include Lake Timsah, one of the Bitter Lakes linked by the Canal.\n\nHistory\nIsmailia was founded in 1863, during the construction of the Suez Canal, by Khedive Ismail, after whom the city is named. Following the Battle of Kafr-el-Dawwar in 1882 the British established a base there.\nThe head office of the Suez Canal Authority is located in Ismailia at the shore of Lake Timsah. It has a large number of buildings dating from British and French involvement with the Canal. Most of these buildings are currently used by Canal employees and officials.\nDuring World War I the British had an air base there and the Battle of Romani took place nearby. Ismailia War Cemetery was designed in 1919 by Sir Robert Lorimer marking the casualties of the battle.\nIn 1973 the Battle of Ismailia took place in the city.\nIn October 2023, a massive fire broke out in the security directorate of the city, leaving the building fully burned with 38 injured and 1 dead.\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe Muslim Brotherhood was founded in Ismailia by Hassan al-Banna in March 1928. An underground paramilitary wing was established in the 1940s, primarily to contest the British occupation of Egypt. In the early 1950s, Ismailia hosted the British Military HQ and the Civilian Administration Centre of the Canal Zone. An attack on an Egyptian government building and army barracks manned by auxiliary policemen by a British Army force on 25 January 1952 was a key event leading to the overthrow of King Farouk I later that year and the Egyptian Revolution that followed. British forces pulled out of Ismailia in 1954.\n\nEparchy\nOn 17 December 1982 an Eparchy (Eastern Catholic Diocese) of Ismayliah was established on territory split off from the Coptic Catholic Patriarchate of Alexandria (Alexandrian Rite in Coptic language), which remains its Metropolitan. Its episcopal see is St. Mark's cathedral.\n\nSuffragan Eparchs (Bishops of Ismayliah)\nAthanasios Abadir (17 December 1982 – 25 December 1992, his death), previously Titular Bishop of Appia and Patriarchal Vicar of Alexandria of the Copts (Egypt) (18 May 1976 – 17 December 1982)\nYouhannes Ezzat Zakaria Badir (23 November 1992 – 23 June 1994), later Eparch (Bishop) of Luqsor of the Copts (Egypt) (23 June 1994 – 27 December 2015, his death)\nMakarios Tewfik (23 June 1994 – 29 June 2019, resigned)\nDaniel Lotfy Khella (29 June 2019 –  23 September 2022) (Patriarchal administrator 23 September 2022  – 31 March 2023)\nPola Ayoub Matta Usama Shafik Akhnoukh (31 March 2023 – Present)\n\nEducation\nIsmailia has several public and private schools. Ismailia is the home of the Suez Canal University, established in 1976 with the help of the Chinese Government to serve the region of Suez Canal and Sinai. Suez Canal University now is one of the fastest growing educational institutions in Egypt with many students studying abroad.\n\nCulture and recreation\nArts and festivals\nIsmailia hosts two important festivals each year. The first is the International Film Festival for Documentaries and Shorts that is held in June. In June 2014, the 17th consecutive festival was organized. The second is the Ismailia International Folklore Arts Festival that is held in September. In this festival folkloric troupes from all around the globe meet in Ismailia, where they perform folkloric dances representing the culture of their countries.\n\nTourism\nIsmailia does get tourists from within Egypt, but is not a major tourism destination for international tourists. The city is approximately a ninety-minute automobile drive from Cairo. From Ismailia it is approximately a four-hour drive to Sharm el-Sheikh in South Sinai. Driving to the Taba Border Crossing at Taba and the Rafah Border Crossing at Rafah are both approximately four-hour drives. A major attraction is the Ismailia Museum which was built in 1932. Visitors will find a variety of significant archaeological finds especially from sites in the Ismailia governorate such as Tell el-Maskhuta, from North Sinai, and from Upper Egypt.\n\nSports\nIsmailia is home to the third most successful club in Egypt (in the field of Football, Ismaily SC. The club's performance is considered a major political issue, and can tend to dictate the city's mood. The team enjoys brief stints of competition for local and international competition, but its financial situation prevents these stints from extending beyond a few years. The team has won the Egyptian League three times (1967, 1991, 2002), the Egyptian Cup twice (1997, 2000), and the African Cup of Champions Clubs once in 1969 as the first Egyptian and Arab Club team to have won this league.\n\nClimate\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh).\nThe hottest recorded temperature was 47 °C (117 °F) on 14 June 1944 while the coldest recorded temperature was 0.2 °C (32.4 °F) in January.\n\nNotable people\nHassan al-Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, worked as a teacher in Ismailia\nLouis Chedid, French singer and songwriter, son of writer Andrée Chedid and father of Matthieu Chedid was born in Ismailia on 1 January 1948\nClaude François, French pop singer and songwriter, born in Ismailia on 1 February 1939\nAli Gabr, footballer\nRagaa Al Geddawy (1934–2020), film actress, model and niece of Taheyya Kariokka\nAhmed Hegazy, footballer\nAura Herzog, First Lady of Israel, wife of former Israeli President Chaim Herzog and mother of current Israeli President Isaac Herzog born in Ismailia on 24 December 1924.\nTaheyya Kariokka, Egyptian belly dancer and film actress, born in Ismailia on 22 February 1919\nYasmine Khlat, Lebanese actress\nFernand Legros (1931-1983), Art dealer\nOsman Ahmed Osman, influential Egyptian engineer, contractor, entrepreneur, and politician, born in Ismailia on 6 April 1917\nMohamed Diab, Egyptian director\nOmar Moawad, footballer\n\nSee also\nList of cities and towns in Egypt\n\nReferences\nFalling Rain Genomics, Inc. \"Geographical information on Al Ismailiyah, Egypt\".

          "content": "The Siwa Oasis (Arabic: واحة سيوة Wāḥat Sīwah [ˈwæːħet ˈsiːwæ]) is an urban oasis in Egypt. It is situated between the Qattara Depression and the Great Sand Sea in the Western Desert, 50 kilometres (31 mi) east of the Egypt–Libya border and 560 kilometres (350 mi) from the Egyptian capital city of Cairo. It is famed from its role in ancient Egypt as the home to an oracle of Amun, the ruins of which are a popular tourist attraction, giving it the ancient name Oasis of Amun-Ra, after the major Egyptian deity.\n\nGeography\nThe oasis is in a deep depression that reaches −19 metres (−62 ft) below sea level. To the west, the al Jaghbub Oasis rests in a similar depression and to the east, the large Qattara Depression is also below sea level. The depression is fertile due to both natural flowing artesian wells and irrigation. It is the site of about 200 natural springs. Siwa is directly adjacent to the Libyan Desert plateau. The geology is characterised by horizontal layers of porous limestones alternated with marls and clays dating back to the Miocene. The limestone plateau and inselbergs resulting from the oasis' erosion along the dunes create reliefs that the Isiwan describe as mountains (adrar in Tamizight). Two large salt lakes are fed by drainage water of agricultural origin. The oasis supports the cultivation of thousands of date palms and olives. Siwa has a temperate desert climate.\n\nName\nThe Ancient Egyptian name of the oasis was sḫt jꜣmw, meaning \"Field of Trees\". The native Libyan toponym may be preserved in the Egyptian t̠ꜣ(j) n d̠rw \"tꜣj on the fringe\" where t̠ꜣ transcribed the local Palaeo-Berber name *Se or *Sa. This name survived in the works of Muslim geographers as سنترية Santariyyah. \nSiwah is the Arabic name of the oasis called Sali in Berber. The oasis is also called Isiwan in modern Berber. \nThe etymology of the word سيوة Siwah is unclear. Champollion derives it from Coptic ⲥⲟⲟⲩϩ (soouh) – a corruption of Egyptian word for \"oasis\", ⲟⲩⲁϩ (ouoh). The additional evidence of the Egyptian source of Siwa's name is another place name in Kharga Oasis that may share the same etymology – S.t-wȝḥ, modern Deir el-Hagar). Basset links it to a Berber tribal name swh attested further west in the early Islamic period, while Ilahiane, following Chafik, links it to the Shilha Berber word asiwan, a type of bird of prey, and hence to Amun-Ra, one of whose symbols was the falcon. Some classical authors referred to the site as \"Ammonium\".\n\nHistory\nAlthough the site is known to have been settled since at least the 10th millennium BCE, the earliest evidence of any connection with Ancient Egypt is the 26th Dynasty, when a necropolis was established. Ancient Greek settlers at Cyrene made contact with the oasis around the same time (7th century BCE), and the oracle temple of Amun (Greek: Zeus Ammon), who, Herodotus was told, took the image here of a ram. Herodotus knew of a \"fountain of the Sun\" that ran coldest in the noontime heat. During his campaign to conquer the Persian Empire, Alexander the Great reached the oasis, supposedly by following birds across the desert. The oracle, Alexander's court historians alleged, confirmed him as both a divine personage and the legitimate Pharaoh of Egypt, though Alexander's motives in making the excursion, following his founding of Alexandria, remain to some extent inscrutable and contested. During the Ptolemaic Kingdom, its Ancient Egyptian name was sḫ.t-ỉm3w, meaning \"Field of Trees\".\nIn the 12th century, Al-Idrisi mentions it as being inhabited mainly by Berbers, with an Arab minority; a century before Al-Bakri stated that only Berbers lived there. The Egyptian historian Al-Maqrizi traveled to Siwa in the 15th century and described how the language spoken there 'is similar to the language of the Zenata'.\nThe first European to document a visit since Roman times was the English traveler William George Browne, who came in 1792 to see the ancient temple of the Oracle of Amun. Bompiani, in her description of the 19th-century explorer Luigi Robecchi Bricchetti, called this site the Oasis of Jupiter Ammon.\nSiwa was annexed by Muhammad Ali of Egypt in 1820, but the Egyptian representative in Siwa was assassinated in 1838. At some point, Muhammad al-Sanusi stayed at Siwa for a few months and gathered some followers there. Later, Siwa was a base of the Sanusiyya in their fight against the British from 1915 to 1917. Meanwhile, in the spring of 1893, German explorer and photographer Hermann Burchardt took photographs of the architecture of the town of Siwa, now stored at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.\nEgyptian rule from distant Cairo was at first tenuous and marked by several revolts. Egypt began to assert firmer control after a 1928 visit to the oasis by King Fuad I, who berated the locals for homosexual practices and specified punishments to bring Siwan behaviour in line with Egyptian morals.\nSiwa was also the site of some fighting during World War I and World War II. The British Army's Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) was based here, but Rommel's Afrika Korps also took possession three times. German soldiers went skinny dipping in the lake of the oracle, contrary to local customs which prohibit public nudity. In 1942, while the Italian 136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti occupied the oasis, a tiny Egyptian puppet government-in-exile was set up at Siwa. The oasis makes a brief appearance as a base of the LRDG in the 1958 war film Ice Cold in Alex.\nThe ancient fortress of Siwa, known as the Shali Ghadi (Shali being the name of the town, and Ghadi meaning \"remote\"), was built on natural rock (an inselberg) and made of kershif (salt and mud-brick) and palm logs. After it was damaged by three days of heavy rains in 1926 it was abandoned for similar unreinforced construction housing on the plain surrounding it, and in some cases those, in turn, have been replaced by more modern cinder block and sheet metal roof buildings. Only one building in the Shali complex has been repaired and is in use, a mosque. Gradually eroded by infrequent rains and slowly collapsing, the Shali remains a prominent feature, towering five stories above the modern town and lit at night by floodlights. It is most easily approached from its southwest side, south of the end of the paved road which curves around from the north side of the Shali. Several uneven pedestrian streets lead from the southwest end of the Shali into it, and the ground is rent in places by deep cracks. Many of the unreinforced kershif buildings bordering the streets of the Shali are also split by large cracks, or they are partially collapsed.\nOther local historic sites of interest include the remains of the oracle temple; the Gebel al Mawta (the Mountain of the Dead), a Roman-era necropolis featuring dozens of rock-cut tombs; and \"Cleopatra's Bath\", an antique natural spring. The fragmentary remains of the oracle temple, with some inscriptions dating from the 4th century BCE, lie within the ruins of Aghurmi. The revelations of the oracle fell into disrepute under the Roman occupation of Egypt.\n\nClimate\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh), as the rest of Egypt.\n\nCulture\nThe traditional culture of Siwa shows many unique elements, some reflecting its longstanding links with the isolated oasis life and the fact that the inhabitants are Siwi Berbers. There are 10 tribes in Siwa that speak an eastern Berber language (Siwi). These tribes have their own cultures and ideals. Until a tarmac road was built to the Mediterranean coast in the 1980s Siwa's only links with the outside world were by arduous camel tracks through the desert. These were used to export dates and olives, bring trade goods, or carry pilgrims on the route which linked the Maghreb to Cairo and hence to Mecca.\n\nAs a result of this isolation, Siwis developed a unique natural culture manifested in its crafts of basketry, pottery, silverwork and embroidery and in its style of dress. The most visible and celebrated examples of this were the bridal silver and the ensemble of silver ornaments and beads that women wore in abundance to weddings and other ceremonies. These pieces were decorated with symbols which related to Siwa's history and beliefs and attitudes.\nThe best known of these pieces is a huge silver disc called 'adrim' and a round necklace, called 'aghraw', from which it hung over the breast. A girl would give up the disc at a special ceremony in the spring the day she was married. The jewelry, which was made by local silversmiths, consisted of silver necklaces, earrings, bangles, hair ornaments, pendants, and many rings. For a wealthy woman, the full ensemble could weigh as much as five or six kilos. These pieces are decorated with symbols common to Berber people across North Africa designed to promote good health, fertility and to protect the wearer from misfortune. Some of the same signs and patterns are found on the embroidery which embellishes women's dresses, trousers, and shawls.\n\nArt and local customs\nThe arrival of the road and of television exposed the oasis to the styles and fashions of the outside world and the traditional silver ornaments were gradually replaced by jewelry made of gold. Evidence of the old styles and traditions are however still in evidence in the women's embroidery and costume. The material for the \"tarfutet\", the distinctive all-enveloping shawl worn by women, are brought from outside the oasis, specifically from the town of Kirdasa, in the Giza Governorate.\n\nFestivals\nSiwi people are very religious so on Ramadan, they tend to close all the shops and stay at home for the whole month. Like other Muslim Egyptians, Siwis celebrate Eid al-Fitr (lʕid ahakkik,\"the Little Eid\") and Eid al-Adha (lʕid azuwwar,\"the Big Eid\"). Unlike other Egyptians, however, on Eid al-Adha Siwis cook the skin of the sheep (along with its innards) as a festival delicacy, after removing the hair. They also eat heart of palm (agroz).\nThe Siyaha Festival (Eid El Solh–Eid El Hasad), in honour of the town's traditional patron saint Sidi Sulayman, is unique to Siwa (the name is often misunderstood as a reference to \"tourism\", but in fact predates tourism). It is known that on this occasion Siwi men meet on a mountain near the town, Gabal Al–Dakrour, to eat together, sing chants while thanking God, and reconcile with one another; all Siwi houses co-operate in preparing and cooking food, in this day Siwian people eat fattah (rice, toasted bread and meat), after Dohr prayer (12:00 PM) all Siwian youth gather to set the banquet, nobody is allowed to eat before the caller announces to start eating so they can all eat together, the women stay behind in the village, and celebrate with dancing, singing, and drums. The food for the festival is bought collectively, with funds gathered by the oasis' mosques, celebrations last for 3 Qamari days, and in the early morning of the fourth day, siwian men form a big march, while holding flags and singing spiritual songs. The march starts from Gabal El – Dakrour and ends in Sidi Solayman square – in the center of Siwa – declaring ending of festivals, and beginning of a new year without hatred or grudge, and with love, respect and reconciliation.\nSiwi children traditionally also celebrated Ashura by lighting torches, singing, and exchanging sweets. Adults' celebration was limited to the preparation of a large meal.\n\nRelations with the Bedouins\nSiwans are preferentially endogamous, only rarely marrying non-Siwans. Nonetheless, Bedouin brides command a higher brideprice in Siwa than Siwan ones.\nAccording to older members of the Awlad Ali Bedouins, the Bedouin relations with Siwans were traditionally mediated through a system of \"friendship\", whereby a specific Siwan (and his descendants) would be the friend of a specific Bedouin (and his descendants). The Bedouin would stay at the Siwan's house when he came to Siwa, and would exchange his animal products and grain for the Siwan's dates and olive oil.\nSiwa's Berbers are close to 30,000 in number.\nThe hot springs are an attraction to visitors.\n\nRole of women\nWomen have traditionally played a prominent role in Siwan households, often being in charge of a household's financial decisions. They have also been responsible for raising children; the town's deputy mayor said in 1985, \"If our children speak Siwi, it to our womenfolk that they owe it.\"\n\nSiwan pederastic tradition\nSiwa is of special interest to anthropologists and sociologists because of its historical acceptance of intergenerational male homosexuality and rituals celebrating same-sex marriage – traditions that the Egyptian authorities have sought to repress, with increasing success, since the early 20th century.\nThe German Egyptologist Georg Steindorff explored the oasis in 1900 and reported that pederastic relations were common and often extended to a form of marriage: \"The feast of marrying a boy was celebrated with great pomp, and the money paid for a boy sometimes amounted to fifteen pounds, while the money paid for a woman was a little over one pound.\" Mahmud Mohammad Abd Allah, writing of Siwan customs for the Harvard Peabody Museum in 1917, commented that although Siwan men could take up to four wives, \"Siwan customs allow a man but one boy to whom he is bound by a stringent code of obligations.\"\nIn 1937, the anthropologist Walter Cline wrote the first detailed ethnography of the Siwans in which he noted: \"All normal Siwan men and boys practice sodomy...among themselves the natives are not ashamed of this; they talk about it as openly as they talk about love of women, and many if not most of their fights arise from homosexual competition....Prominent men lend their sons to each other. All Siwans know the matings which have taken place among their sheiks and their sheiks' sons....Most of the boys used in sodomy are between 12 and 18 years of age.\" After an expedition to Siwa, the archaeologist Count Byron de Prorok reported in 1937 \"an enthusiasm [that] could not have been approached even in Sodom... Homosexuality was not merely rampant, it was raging...Every dancer had his boyfriend...[and] chiefs had harems of boys\".\nIn the late 1940s, a Siwan merchant told the visiting British novelist Robin Maugham that the Siwan women were \"badly neglected\", but that Siwan men \"will kill each other for boy. Never for a woman\", although as Maugham noted, marriage to a boy had become illegal by then. The Egyptian archaeologist Ahmed Fakhry, who studied Siwa for three decades, observed in 1973 that \"While the Siwans were still living inside their walled town, none of these bachelors was allowed to spend the night in the town and had to sleep outside the gates...Under such circumstances it is not surprising that homosexuality was common among them....Up to the year 1928, it was not unusual that some kind of written agreement, which was sometimes called a marriage contract, was made between two males; but since the visit of King Fu'ad to this oasis it has been completely forbidden...However, such agreements continued, but in great secrecy, and without the actual writing, until the end of World War II. Now the practice is not followed.\"\nDespite the multiplicity of sources for these practices, the Egyptian authorities and even the Siwan tribal elders have attempted to repress the historical and anthropological record. When the Siwa-born anthropologist Fathi Malim included reference to Siwan homosexuality (especially a love poem from a man to a youth) in his book Oasis Siwa (2001), the tribal council demanded that he blank out the material in the current edition of the book and remove it from future editions, or be expelled from the community. Malim reluctantly agreed and physically deleted the passages in the first edition of his book, and excluded them from the second. A newer book, Siwa Past and Present (2005) by A. Dumairy, the Director of Siwa Antiquities, omits all mention of the famous historical practices of the inhabitants.\n\nPeople\nAbout 80 km (50 mi) in length and 20 km (12 mi) wide, Siwa Oasis is one of Egypt's most isolated settlements, with about 25,000 people, mostly Siwi Berbers (Siwi: Isiwan. The municipality hosts the easternmost Berber-speaking community, whose language, called Siwi (Jlan n Isiwan), shares many linguistic features with the languages of Sokna and El Foqaha in Libya, partially also with the Zenati group, and which has been heavily influenced by Arabic.\nWhile the majority of the population of Siwa is Berber, the oasis is also home to a Bedouin community related to the Awlad Ali, the Shahibaat, as well as to a growing number of other Egyptian settlers. Currently, the entire population of the oasis speaks Arabic as either a first or a second language. The Siwi Berber population is also fluent in Egyptian Arabic, which is called Masri \"Egyptian\".\n\nEconomy\nSiwa has been noted for its dates since ancient times, and today date palm cultivation is by far the largest component of its economy. In a distant second place, with about one-fifth of the scale as dates, is olive cultivation. Handicrafts like basketry are also of regional importance.\nTourism has in recent decades become a vital source of income. Much attention has been given to creating hotels that use local materials and display local styles.\n\nArchaeology\nIn the mid-20th century, Egyptian archaeologist Ahmed Fakhry worked at Siwa (and elsewhere in the Western Desert).\nIn 1995, Greek archaeologist Liana Souvaltzi announced that she had identified the tomb of Alexander the Great in the oasis of Siwa. She made the following statement to the Greek media:\n\nBut I am speaking to every Greek all over the world. I want every one of you to feel proud because Greek hands have found this very important monument.\n\nThis statement was an answer to the, at the time, Greek prime minister Costas Simitis who urged the archaeologists to stop their research in Egypt and sent a Greek Embassy advisor to ask the Egyptian government to withdraw Mrs Souvaltzi’s permission to excavate in the area. The case is still active in the Greek courts of law.\nAn extremely old hominid footprint was discovered in 2007 at Siwa Oasis. Egyptian scientists claimed it could be 2–3 million years old, which would make it the oldest fossilized hominid footprint ever found. However, no proof of this conjecture was ever presented.\nIn late 2013, an announcement was made regarding the apparent archaeoastronomy discovery of precise spring and fall equinox sunrise alignments over the Aghurmi mound/Amun Oracle when viewed from Timasirayn temple in the Western Desert, 12 km away across Lake Siwa. The first known recent public viewing of this event occurred on March 21, 2014, during the spring equinox.\n\nIn popular culture\nSiwa Oasis is an official map for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory which belongs to North Africa Campaign. The fifth mission from the game Sniper Elite III takes place on the Siwa Oasis. Siwa is prominently featured in the videogame Assassin's Creed: Origins and is the birthplace and home of the protagonist Bayek of Siwa. In British author Anthony Horowitz's Alex Rider series, the ninth and eleventh instalments Scorpia Rising and Never Say Die feature Siwa. In Australian author Matthew Reilly's Jack West series of seven novels starting with Seven Ancient Wonders feature prominently the Oracle of Siwa.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of cities and towns in Egypt\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBattesti, Vincent (2006).

          "content": "Bahariya Oasis (Arabic: الواحات البحرية, romanized: El-Wāḥāt El-Baḥrīya, \"the Northern Oases\") is a depression and a naturally rich oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt. It is approximately 370 km away from Cairo. The roughly oval valley extends from northeast to southwest, has a length of 94 km, a maximum width of 42 km and covers an area of about 2000 km2.\nThe valley is surrounded by mountains and has numerous springs. Located in Giza Governorate, the main economic sectors are agriculture, iron ore mining, and tourism. The main agricultural products are guavas, mangos, dates, and olives.\n\nNames\nIn Ancient Egypt, the oasis had two names. The name 'ḏsḏs' (Djesdjes) is first mentioned on a scarab dating back to the Middle Kingdom. In the New Kingdom, this name is rarely found, although it does appear for example in the Temple of Luxor and in the account of King Kamose, who occupied the oasis during the war against the Hyksos. From the 25th Dynasty it was almost the only name used. Another name wḥꜣt mḥtt (\"the Northern Oasis\") was almost exclusively used in the New Kingdom; it appears for instance on the local grave of Amenhotep, and is found again in the list of oasis in the Temple at Edfu.\nFrom 45 CE, the depression was known in Latin as Oasis parva (Small Oasis). The Greek historian Strabo called it the \"Second Oasis\", and the 5th century CE historian Olympiodorus of Thebes called it \"the Third Oasis\".\nIn Coptic times, it was known as the \"Oasis of Oxyrhynchus\" (Coptic: ϯⲟⲩⲁϩ `ⲙⲡⲉⲙϫⲉ Diwah Ēmbemdje) or Tast(s) (Coptic: ⲧⲁⲥⲧ(ⲥ)), which is derived from Ancient Egyptian ḏsḏs. After the Islamization of Egypt, it was called the Oasis of Bahnasa, \"Oasis of Oxyrhynchus\".\nThe modern name is الواحات البحرية, al-Wāḥāt al-Baḥriyya meaning \"the Northern Oases\". The southern part of the depression around El Heiz apparently never had a separate name.\n\nTowns\nBahariya consists of many villages, of which El Bawiti is the largest and the administrative center. Qasr is el-Bawiti's neighboring/twin village. To the east, about ten kilometers away are the villages of Mandishah and el-Zabu. A smaller village called el-'Aguz lies between El Bawiti and Mandishah. Harrah, the easternmost village, is a few kilometers east of Mandishah and el-Zabu. El Heiz, also called El-Hayez, is the southernmost village, but it may not always be considered as part of Bahariya because it is so far from the rest of the villages, about fifty kilometers south of El Bawiti. There is an oasis at El-Hayez where mummies have been found on which genetic studies have been conducted.\n\nHistory\nThe depression has been populated since the Neolithic, although archaeological evidence is not continuous. In El Heiz, a prehistoric settlement site of hunter-gatherers was found with remains of grindstones, arrowheads, scrapers, chisels, and ostrich eggshells. In Qārat el-Abyaḍ, a Czech team led by Miroslav Bárta discovered a settlement of the Old Kingdom. Rock inscriptions in el-Harrah and other records date to the Middle Kingdom and upwards. The tomb of Amenhotep called Huy was erected in Qarat Hilwah at the end of the 18th dynasty. In the 26th dynasty, the depression was culturally and economically flourishing. This can be learned from the chapels in 'Ain el-Muftilla, the tombs in Qārat Qasr Salim and Qarat esh-Sheikh Subi, and the site of Qasr 'Allam.\nThe Greco-Roman period was a time of prosperity. There is the ruin of a temple dedicated to Ammon by Alexander the Great located in Qasr el-Miqisba ('Ain et-Tibniya). It is believed by some Egyptologists that Alexander passed through Bahariya while returning from the oracle of Ammon at Siwa Oasis. Excavations of the Greco-Roman necropolis found in 1995 and known as the Valley of the Golden Mummies began in 1999. Approximately thirty-four tombs have been excavated from this area. In Roman times, a big military fort was erected at Qarat el-Toub.\nIn the spring of 2010, a Roman-era mummy was unearthed in a Bahariya Oasis cemetery in el-Harrah. The female mummy was 3 feet tall and covered with plaster decorated to resemble Roman dress and jewellery. In addition to the female mummy, archaeologists found clay and glass vessels, coins, anthropoid masks and fourteen Greco-Roman tombs. Director of Cairo and Giza Antiquities Mahmoud Affifi, the archaeologist who led the dig, said the tomb has a unique design with stairways and corridors, and could date to 300 BC. This find came as a result of excavation work for the construction of a youth center.\nIn 2019, archaeologists discovered 19 structures and a church carved into the bedrock from the fifth century CE. The church was decorated with religious inscriptions in Greek. In 2021, archaeologists discovered a complex with the ruins of three churches and monks cells date back to the fifth century CE.\nDuring World War I, the Baharia Military Railway was built to provide access to the oasis. In the early 1970s, an asphalt road connecting Bahariya to Cairo was finished. With the new road came electricity, cars, television, phone lines, a more accessible route to Cairo, and, more recently, internet. The spread of people and ideas between Bahariya and Cairo has increased dramatically since the road was constructed. Also, the language of the Waḥātī people has changed under the influence of the Cairo dialect, as heard on television and in music.\n\nPeople and culture\nThe people of the oasis, or the Waḥātī people (meaning \"of the oasis\" in Arabic), are the descendants of the ancient people who inhabited the oasis, ancient tribes with connection to western Egypt and eastern Libya, and the north coast, and other people from the Nile Valley who came to settle in the oasis.\nThe majority of Waḥātī people in Bahariya are Muslims. There are some mosques in Bahariya. The nature of social settings in the oasis is highly influenced by Islam.\nTraditional music is very important to the Waḥātī people. Flutes, drums, and the simsimeyya (a harp-like instrument) are played at social gatherings, particularly at weddings. Traditional songs sung in rural style are passed down from generation to generation, and new songs are invented as well. Music from Cairo, the greater Middle East, and other parts of the world are now easily accessible to the people of the oasis.\nBahariya used to be a major center for Coptic Christians. However, most of the Oasis population converted to Islam centuries ago. Copts that live in Bahariya today are largely new transplants from the Nile Valley.\nThe traditional dress of women in Bahariya is called Magaddil (braids) after the striped pattern of the embroidery. There was also a dress that was lightly embroidered, with a border of telli embroidery around the neck that was made separately and sewn onto the dress. In recent times these have largely been phased out by floral print dresses.\n\nEconomy\nAgriculture is still an important source of income, though now the iron ore industry close to Bahariya provides jobs for many Wahati people. Recently there has also been an increase in tourism to the oasis because of antiquities (tombs, mummies and other artifacts have been discovered there), and because of the beautiful surrounding deserts. Wahati and foreign guides lead adventure desert tours based out of Bahariya to the surrounding White and Black deserts, and sometimes to Siwa or the southern oases. Tourism is a new and important source of income for locals, and it has brought an international presence to the oasis.\n\nFossils\nTameryraptor and Bahariasaurus (meaning \"Bahariya lizard\") as well as the holotype specimen of the famous Spinosaurus are dinosaurs which have been found in the Bahariya Formation, which date to about 95 million years ago. Bahariasaurus was a huge theropod and was described by Ernst Stromer in 1934, however the type specimen was destroyed during World War II in 1944. In 2000, an American scientific team conducted by Joshua Smith found the remains of sauropod dinosaur, Paralititan stromeri.\nThe region between the Bahariya and Farafra depressions used to have volcanic activity during the Jurassic Period. In addition, the landscape contains some hills made of barite or calcite crystals, and also golden limestone boulders which became a sanctuary for species, such as white foxes, gazelles and rams.\nIn June 2022, paleontologists reported the discovery of a 98-million-year-old type of abelisaurid in Bahariya Oasis, which was around 20 feet (6.1 m) in length and initially found in 2016.\n\nClimate\nNotes\nSee also\nBahariasaurus (meaning \"Bahariya lizard\")\nBahariya Formation (fossil bearing geologic formation)\nErnst Stromer\n\nReferences\nFakhry, Ahmed.

It is in the large Western Desert of Egypt, approximately midway between Dakhla and Bahariya oases.\nFarafra has an estimated 5,000 inhabitants (2002) mainly living in the town of Farafra and is mostly inhabited by the local Bedouins. Parts of the town have complete quarters of traditional architecture, simple, smooth, unadorned, all in mud colour—local culture and traditional methods of building and carrying out repairs have been supported by its tourism.  Often grouped within Farafra are the hot springs at Bir Sitta (the sixth well) and the El-Mufid lake.\n\nEtymology\nThe word al-Farafra (al-Farafira in local pronunciation, Arabic: الفرفرون al-Farfarun in Middle Ages) is a broken plural form of Arabic: فرفر farfar meaning \"fizzy spring\". The oasis was called in Ancient Egyptian: tꜣ jḥw, \"the land of cattle\".\n\nHistory\nArchaeological evidence suggests that Farafra region was inhabited since late Pleistocene. Farafra was known in ancient Egyptian history at least since the Middle Kingdom. In the Ptolemaic period, the region was under the administration of the Oxyrhynchite nome (19th Upper Egyptian nome).\n\nWhite Desert\nA main geographic attraction of Farafra is its White Desert (known as Sahara el Beyda)—a national park of Egypt and 45 km (28 mi) north of the town of Farafra, the main draw of which is its rock type colored from snow-white to cream. It has massive chalk rock formations that are textbook examples of ventifact and which have been created as a result of occasional sandstorm in the area. The White Desert is a typical place visited by some schools in Egypt, as a location for camping trips.\n\nWells\nThe Roman spring of Ain Bishay bubbles forth from a hillock on the northwest edge of town. It has been developed into an irrigated grove of date palms together with citrus, olive, apricot and carob trees, and is a cool haven amid the arid landscape. Several families tend the crops here; you should seek someone out and ask permission before wandering around.\nDue to its geographical location and geological formation it has more than 100 wells spread out over the lands of the Farafra, many of which are natural. Most of these wells are used in aggregation of the cultivated land in the oasis. Some of the wells in Farafra have become a favorite tourist destination. Bir Sitta, (well 6 in Arabic), Bir Sab'a (well 7) and Bir Ithnian wa ishrin (well 22) are the most important. Because of the water's warm temperature and a slight percentage of sulfur, these wells are favorable for swimming and relaxation. There is a large lake touristic well named Abu Nus 15 kilometers north of the edge of the Farafra.\n\nClimate\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh).\n\nGallery\nReferences\nBibliography\nBeadnell, Hugh J.

          "content": "Dakhla Oasis or Dakhleh Oasis (Egyptian Arabic: الواحات الداخلة‎ El Waḥat el Daḵla, pronounced [elwæ'ħæ:t edˈdæ:xlæ], \"the inner oases\"), is one of the seven oases of Egypt's Western Desert. Dakhla Oasis lies in the New Valley Governorate, 350 km (220 mi.) from the Nile and between the oases of Farafra and Kharga. It measures approximately 80 km (50 mi) from east to west and 25 km (16 mi) from north to south.\n\nHistory\nPrehistory\nThe first contacts between the pharaonic power and the oases started around 2550 BCE.\nThe human history of this oasis started during the Pleistocene, when nomadic tribes settled sometimes there, in a time when the Sahara climate was wetter and where humans could have access to lakes and marshes. But about 6,000 years ago, the entire Sahara became drier, changing progressively into a hyper-arid desert (with less than 50 mm of rain per year). However, specialists think that nomadic hunter-gatherers began to settle almost permanently in the oasis of Dakhleh in the period of the Holocene (about 12,000 years ago), during new, but rare episodes of wetter times.\nIn fact, the drier climate didn't mean that there was more water than today in what is now known as the Western Desert. The south of the Libyan Desert has the most important supply of subterranean water in the world through the Nubian Aquifer, and the first inhabitants of the Dakhla Oasis had access to surface water sources. In the third millennium BC the probably nomadic people of the Sheikh Muftah culture lived here.\n\nPharaonic period\nDuring the late 6th Dynasty, hieratic script was sometimes incised into clay tablets with a stylus, similar to cuneiform. About five hundred such tablets have been discovered in the governor's palace at Ayn Asil (Balat) in the Dakhla Oasis. At the time the tablets were made, Dakhla was located far from centers of papyrus production. These tablets record inventories, name-lists, accounts, and approximately fifty letters.\n\nDeir el-Hagar\nDeir el-Hagar (Egyptian Arabic: دير الحجر‎ 'Monastery of Stone', Ancient Egyptian: S.t-wȝḥ, Sioua) is a Roman sandstone temple on the western edge of Dakhla Oasis, about 10 km from Qasr ad-Dakhla. The Temple was erected during the reign of the Roman Emperor Nero, and decorated during the time of Vespasian, Titus and Domitian. The temple was dedicated to the Theban triad, composed of Amun-Ra, Mut and Khonsu, as well as to Seth, the main deity of the region.\n\nQasr ad-Dakhla\nThe fortified Islamic town of Qasr ad-Dakhla or el-Qasr (Arabic: قصر الداخلة, the Fortress) was built in the 12th century on the remains of a Roman fort in the NW of the Dakhla Oasis by the Ayyubid kings. Many of the up to four-storey mud brick Ottoman and Mamluk buildings contain blocks of stone with hieroglyphics from the ancient Thoth temple of the nearby site of Amheida. The three-storey, 21-meter-high minaret is dated 924 CE.\n\nAfter 1800\nSir Archibald Edmonstone visited Dakhla oasis in the year 1819. He was succeeded by several other early travellers, among whom Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs in 1873–1874. It was not until 1908 that the first Egyptologist, Herbert Winlock, visited Dakhla Oasis and noted its monuments in some systematic manner. In the 1950s, detailed studies began, first by Ahmed Fakhry, and in the late 1970s, expeditions of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale and the Dakhleh Oasis Project (see below) each began detailed studies in the oasis.\n\nRecent discoveries\nIn August 2017, archaeologists from the Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of five mud-brick tombs at Bir esh-Shaghala, dating back nearly 2000 years. Researchers also revealed worn masks gilded with gold, several large jars and a piece of pottery with unsolved ancient Egyptian writing on it.\nSome of the tombs are completely large containing several burial chambers, while one tomb has a roof built in the shape of a pyramid and some of them with vaulted roofs.\n\nGeography\nDakhla Oasis consists of several communities, along a string of sub-oases. The main settlements are Mut (more fully Mut el-Kharab and anciently called Mothis), El-Masara, Al-Qasr, together with several smaller villages.\n\nClimate\nDakhla Oasis has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), typical of much of Egypt.\n\nDakhleh Oasis Project\nThe Dakhleh Oasis Project (DOP) is a long-term study project of the Dakhleh Oasis and the surrounding palaeo-oasis, initiated in 1978 when the Royal Ontario Museum and the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities were awarded a joint concession for part of the Oasis. In 1979, the Centre for Archaeology and Ancient History at Monash University began to cooperate in the project.\nThe DOP studies the interaction between environmental changes and human activity in the Dakhleh Oasis. The excavations at Ismant el-Kharab (ancient Kellis), Mut el-Kharab (ancient Mothis), Deir Abu Metta and Muzawwaqa were undertaken with the cooperation of Monash University. The DOP has also excavated at 'Ain el-Gazzareen, El Qasr el-Dakhil, Deir el Hagar and Ain Birbiyeh.\nIn 1985, the Petroglyph Unit of the Dakhleh Oasis Project was created by Lech Krzyżaniak, then director of the Archaeological Museum in Poznań, under the auspices of the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw. At first, the studies of the petroglyphs focused on the eastern part of the oasis, where rock carvings had been documented by archaeologists already before World War II (Herbert Winlock and Hans Alexander Winkler). The expedition created systematic documentation of both the depictions mentioned earlier in the literature and the newly discovered ones. Aerial photographs proved helpful in this work. Then, under the direction of Michał Kobusiewicz from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, attention was turned to the area of the Central Oasis where 270 new petroglyph sites were recorded. The current director of The Petroglyph Unit, Paweł Polkowski from the Archaeological Museum in Poznań, extended the area of prospection and created a map showing the distribution of more than 1,300 panels with rock art. The depictions date from the Prehistory to the Islamic period and include images of animals and people (often pregnant women), hieroglyphs, and Beduin markings.\nIn addition to the Dakhleh Oasis Project, long-term excavations have been conducted in Balat (IFAO), Amheida (New York University) and Bir el-Shaghala (Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities).\n\nDakhleh Trust\nThe Dakhleh Trust was formed in 1999 and is a registered charity in Britain. Its declared aim is to advance understanding of the history of the environment and cultural evolution throughout the Quaternary period in the eastern Sahara, and particularly in the Dakhla Oasis. To this end, the present trustees have committed themselves to supporting the DOP.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nPublished works\nBoozer, A. \"Archaeology on Egypt's Edge: Archaeological Research in the Dakhleh Oasis, 1819-1977\" in Ancient West & East: 12: 117–156. 2013.\nFakhry, A.

It is located in the Western Desert, about 200 km (125 miles) to the west of the Nile valley. \"Kharga\" or \"El Kharga\" is also the name of a major town located in the oasis, the capital of New Valley Governorate. The oasis, which was known as the 'Southern Oasis' to the Ancient Egyptians, the 'outer' (he Exotero) to the Greeks and Oasis Magna to the Romans, is the largest of the oases in the Libyan desert of Egypt. It is in a depression about 160 km (100 miles) long and from 20 km (12 miles) to 80 km (50 miles) wide. Its estimated population is 87,482 as of 2023.\n\nOverview\nKharga is the most modernised of Egypt's western oases. The main town is highly functional with all modern facilities, and virtually nothing left of old architecture. There is extensive thorny date palm, acacia, buffalo thorn, and jujube growth in the oasis surrounding the modern town of Kharga. Many remnant wildlife species inhabit this region.\n\nClimate\nThe Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh). Kharga Oasis experiences extreme summers for most of the year with no precipitation and warm winters with cool nights.\n\nDarb El Arba'īn caravan route\nA trade route called Darb El Arba'īn (\"the Way of Forty\") passed through Kharga as part of a long caravan route running north–south between Middle Egypt and the Sudan. The ancient route connected the Al-Fashir area of Sudan to Asyut in Egypt, navigating through a chain of oases including Kharga, Selima Oasis and Bir Natrun.\nAt least 700 years old, it was likely used from as early as the Old Kingdom of Egypt for the transport and trade of gold, ivory, spices, wheat, animals and plants.\n\nThe maximum extent of Darb El Arba'īn was northward from Kobbei in Darfur (located about 25 miles north of al-Fashir) passing through the desert, through Bir Natrum and Wadi Howar, and ending at the Nile River access point of Asyut in Egypt. This is a journey of approximately 1,800 km (1,100 mi). The desert route was less expensive and safer than the more visually appealing Nile route.\nAll the oases have always been crossroads of caravan routes converging from the barren desert. In the case of Kharga, this is made particularly evident by the presence of a chain of fortresses that the Romans built to protect the Darb El Arba'īn route.  The forts vary in size and function, some being just small outposts, some guarding large settlements complete with cultivation.  Some were installed where earlier settlements already existed, while others were probably started from scratch. All of them are made of mud bricks, but some also contain small stone temples with inscriptions on the walls.\nDescribed by Herodotus as a road \"traversed…in forty days,\" by his time the route had already become an important land route facilitating trade between Nubia and Egypt. The length of the journey is the reason for it being called Darb El Arba`īn, the implication being \"the forty-day road\".\nAfter the prominent Christian theologian Nestorius was condemned as a heretic in the 431 Council of Ephesus, he was removed from his position as Patriarch of Constantinople and exiled to a monastery then located in the Great Oasis of Hibis (El Kharga). There he lived for the rest of his life. The monastery suffered attacks by desert bandits, and Nestorius was injured in one such raid. Nestorius seems to have survived there until at least 450 and there had composed the Bazaar of Heracleides—the only one of his writings to survive in full, and of importance to the Christian Nestorians who follow his teachings.\nAs part of a caravan proceeding to Darfur, the English explorer W.G. Browne paused for several days at Kharga, leaving with the rest of the group 7 June 1793. At the time a gindi (a Turkish horseman, that performs extraordinary feats) was stationed at Kharga, \"belonging to Ibrahim Bey El Kebir, to whom those villages appertain; and to [this official] is entrusted the management of what relates to the caravan during the time of its stay there.\"\nIn 1930 the archaeologist, Gertrude Caton–Thompson, uncovered the palaeolithic history of Kharga.\n\nTemple of Hibis\nDemographics\nIn his diary, “Al-Hajj Al-Bari” mentioned the most important families descending of Christians and Romans in the Kharga Oasis. They are the families of “Al-Jawiya, the families of Al-Tawayh, the Al-Bahramah family, the Al-Sanadiyah family, the Al-Azayza family, the Al-Badayrah family, the Al-Mahbasiya family, the Al-Hosnieh family, and the Al-Na’imah family And the Al-Sharayra family, and there are Nubian families in the village of Baris.  There are few Berber families too who are thought to be the indigenous people of Kharga but the majority today are Arab families.\nPerhaps the most important of these Arab families that came to the Khargha Oasis from the beginning of the year 300 AH are the families of the Idris from Tunisia or Libya, the family of Rekabia and the family of the jewehera from the Hijaz and the family of shakawera and the family of Al-Radawana and the family from the Arabs of Mecca and the family of Al-Shawami from the Levant and there are families from the countries of the Egyptian country such as Dabatiya and Asawiya from Assiut Or Sohag and the Awlad-el-sheikh from Egypt “It is more likely to mean Cairo”, the family of Njarin from Qalamoun in Dakhla, the family of Al Shaabna from Mallawi, the family of Al-Awamir from Al-Amayem tribe and the family of Al-Alawneh from Al-Alawiya in addition to Turkish families such as Al-Dabashiya, Al-Tarakah Al-Kharja and the Bash families The Qaqamqam, Askari, Tannabur, Qitas, and Kashif.\n\nTransportation\nA regular bus service connects the oasis to the other Western oases and to the rest of Egypt. In 1907, the narrow gauge Western Oasis Lines provided twice-weekly train services. A standard gauge railway line Kharga → Qena (Nile Valley) → Port Safaga (Red Sea) has been in service since 1996, but has been decommissioned soon after.\n\nArchaeological sites\nThe Temple of Hibis is a Saite-era temple founded by Psamtik II, which was erected largely c. 500 BC. It is located about 2 kilometres north of modern Kharga, in a palm-grove. There is a second 1st millennium BC temple in the southernmost part of the oasis at Dush. An ancient Christian cemetery at El Bagawat also functioned at the Kharga Oasis from the 3rd to the 7th century AD. It is one of the earliest and best preserved Christian cemeteries in the ancient world.\nThe first list of sites is due to Ahmad Fakhri but serious archaeological work began in 1976 with Serge Sauneron, director of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale.\n\nSites\nAin El Beleida (Roman)\nAin El Labakha (Roman)\nAin Manawir (Persian, Roman)\nAin Shams El Din (Coptic church)\nAin El Tarakwa (Roman)\nAin Tauleib (Roman)\nDeir Mustafa Kashef (Coptic monastery)\nDeir El Munira (Roman)\nDush, Egypt (Ptolemaic and Roman)\nGabbanat El Bagawat (Coptic cemetery)\nGebel El Teir (Prehistoric times)\nEl Nadura (Roman)\nQasr El Dabashiya (Roman)\nQasr Dush (Greco-Roman)\nQasr El Ghuweita (Late Period)\nQasr El Gibb (Roman)\nQasr El Zayyan (Greco-Roman)\nSumeira (Roman)\nTemple of Hibis (Persian - c. 6th century BC.)\nUmm El Dabadib (Roman)\nUmm Mawagir (Middle Kingdom, 2nd Intermediate Period)\n\nMeteorite dagger\nIn June 2016, a report emerged that attributed the dagger buried with Pharaoh Tutankhamun to an iron meteorite, with similar proportions of metals (iron, nickel and cobalt) to one discovered near and named after Kharga Oasis.

Today, Sharm El Sheikh and its holiday resorts is a significant centre for tourism in Egypt, while also attracting many international conferences, diplomatic meetings and also concerts and clubbing.\nDowntown Sharm El Sheikh has the major concentrations of international banks in the city and is home to several large national companies. The city is home to major hospitals and health facilities, including Sharm International Hospital, the city's largest hospital and others engaged in health-related care and research. Sharm El Sheikh port is the city's seaport, which lies on the coast of the Red Sea,   and the nearest airport is the city's Sharm El Sheikh International Airport. The Sharm El Sheikh metropolitan area is one of the most visited cities in Egypt, attracting over 10 million visitors in 2024.\n\nName\nThe English name of Sharm El Sheikh is a borrowing of the Egyptian Arabic شرم الشيخ, šarm aš-šayḵ and, as such, does not have a fixed romanisation. There are documented uses of alternate spellings such as Sharm el Sheikh and Sharm el-Sheikh, sometimes within the same news article.\nSharm El Sheikh is sometimes referred to as the \"City of Peace\" (مدينة السلام, madinet es-salām), referring to the large number of international peace conferences that have been held there.\nAmongst Egyptians and also many visitors, the name of the city is commonly shortened to \"Sharm\" (Egyptian Arabic: [ʃɑɾm]), which is its common name in Egyptian Arabic.\n\nGeography and history\nSharm El Sheikh is on a promontory overlooking the Straits of Tiran at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba. Its strategic importance led to its transformation from a fishing village into a major port and naval base for the Egyptian Navy. It was conquered by Israel during the Suez Crisis of 1956 and returned to Egypt in 1957. A United Nations peacekeeping force was stationed there until 1967 when it was ordered to leave by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, a fact that precipitated the Six-Day War during which it was reoccupied by Israel. Sharm El Sheikh remained under Israeli control from 1967 until the Sinai Peninsula was returned back to Egypt in 1982, after the Egypt–Israel peace treaty of 1979 that was signed in Washington, D.C. During that time, an Israeli settlement named Ofira was built in the area.\nIn 1968, Israel opened an air force military base there, where Egypt later built the Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport on the same location that included an enormous $420m investment by the Egyptian Holding Company for Airports and Air Navigation, a major project that helped put the city on global map.  Unlike Sinai's other well-known settlement, Yamit, Ofira was not demolished after Israel ceded control of Sinai to Egypt following the Camp David Accords, but was returned intact and is today a thriving tourist town and home to local Egyptian residents.\nEgypt's former president Hosni Mubarak designated Sharm El Sheikh as The City of Peace in 1982 and the Egyptian government began a policy of encouraging massive development of the city. Egyptian businessmen and investors, along with global investors contributed to building several mega projects, including mosques and churches. The city is now an international tourist destination, and environmental zoning laws limit the height of buildings to avoid obscuring the natural beauty of the surroundings. In 2022, Sharm El-Sheikh along with another Egyptian city, Hurghada, were both chosen by Trip advisor as the world's top 25 tourist destinations.\nA hierarchical planning approach was adopted for the Gulf of Aqaba, whereby the area's components were evaluated and subdivided into zones, cities and centers. In accordance with this approach, the Gulf of Aqaba zone was subdivided into four cities: Taba, Nuweiba, Dahab and Sharm El Sheikh. Sharm El Sheikh city has been subdivided into five homogeneous centers, namely Nabq, Ras Nusrani, Naama Bay, Umm Sid and Sharm El Maya.\nSharm El Sheikh city, with Naama Bay, Hay el Nour, Hadaba, Rowaysat, Montazah and Shark's Bay form a metropolitan area.\nThe site off the shore gun emplacements at Ras Nasrani opposite Tiran Island is now a diving area.\nIn 2005, the resort was hit by the Sharm El Sheikh terrorist attacks, which were carried out by an extremist Islamist organisation targeting Egypt's tourist industry. Eighty-eight people were killed, the majority of them Egyptians, and over 200 were wounded by the attack, making it the second deadliest terrorist attack in the country's history.\n\nThe city has played host to a number of important Middle Eastern peace conferences, including the 4 September 1999 agreement to establish Palestinian self-rule over the Gaza Strip. A second summit was held at Sharm on 17 October 2000 following the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada, but it failed to end the violence. A summit was held in the city on 3 August 2005 on developments in the Arab world, such as the situation in the Arab–Israeli conflict. Again in 2007, an important ministerial meeting took place in Sharm, where dignitaries discussed Iraqi reconstruction.\n\nThe World Economic Forum on the Middle East was hosted by Sharm El Sheikh in 2006 and 2008. Amidst the 2011 Egyptian protests, then-president Mubarak reportedly went to Sharm El Sheikh and resigned there on 11 February 2011. The 2014 World Economic Forum in Sharm El Sheikh heralded a new initiative for desert cities urban development in Egypt.  In November 2022, the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) was held in Sharm El Sheikh. This conference led to the first loss and damage fund being created.\nOn Monday, October 13, 2025, the city hosted an international summit titled \"Sharm El-Sheikh Peace Summit\" co-chaired by President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and US President Donald Trump, with the participation of world leaders from more than 20 countries aiming to end the war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nClimate\nThe city experiences a subtropical arid climate, classified by the Köppen–Geiger system as hot desert (BWh). Temperatures are just short of a tropical climate. Typical temperatures range from 18 to 23 °C (64 to 73 °F) in January and 33 to 37 °C (91 to 99 °F) in August. The temperature of the Red Sea in this region ranges from 21 to 28 °C (70 to 82 °F) over the course of the year.\nMarsa Alam, Kosseir and Sharm El Sheikh have the warmest winter night temperatures of cities and resorts in Egypt.\nThe highest recorded temperature was 46 °C (115 °F) on 3 June 2013, and the lowest recorded temperature was 5 °C (41 °F) on 23 February 2000.\n\nEconomy and tourism\nSharm El Sheikh's major industry is foreign and domestic tourism, owing to its landscape, year-round dry climate with long hot summers and warm winters and its long beaches. Its waters are clear and calm for most of the year and have become popular for various water sports, particularly recreational scuba diving and snorkelling. There is scope for scientific tourism due to the diversity of marine life: 250 different coral reefs and 1000 species of fishes.\nThese natural resources, together with its proximity to tourist markets in Europe, have stimulated rapid growth in tourism in the region. The number of resorts has increased from three in 1982 to ninety-one in 2000. Guest nights also increased in that period from sixteen thousand to 5.1 million. International hotel companies that currently operate in the city include Accor (Mövenpick, Novotel, Rixos), Deutsche Hospitality (Steigenberger), Four Seasons, Hilton (DoubleTree), Marriott (Renaissance, Sheraton), and Rotana, with categories of three to five stars. In 2007, the first aqua park hotel resort opened in the area. The four-star Aqua Blu Sharm Resort was built on the Ras Om El Seid, with an area of 133,905 square metres (1,441,340 sq ft).\nSharm is also home to a congress center, located along Peace Road, where international political and economic meetings have been held, including peace conferences, ministerial meetings, world bank meetings, and Arab League meetings. The Maritim Sharm El Sheikh International Congress Centre can host events and congresses for up to 4,700 participants.\nThere is nightlife in Sharm El Sheikh. The colourful handicraft stands of the local Bedouin culture are a popular attraction. Ras Muhammad National Park, at the southernmost tip of the peninsula, has been designated a national park, protecting the area's wildlife, natural landscape, shoreline and coral reef. There are a number of international hotels and restaurants in the centre of Sharm, in the area known as Naama Bay, with golf courses and other leisure facilities further up the coast.\nThe Nabq Managed Resource Protected Area is a 600-square-kilometre (230 sq mi) area of mangroves, coral reefs, fertile dunes, birds and wildlife.\nAs of 2012, nationals from the EU and the US do not require a visa for travel to Sharm El Sheikh if the visit is for fourteen days or less, although those travelling outside the Sinai area may still require a visa, which is purchasable for a small fee on arrival. Visitors are often ushered into a queue to buy a visa after entering the airport upon landing.\n\nFlight incidents\nOn 23 August 2015, Thomson Airways Flight 476, approaching Sharm El Sheikh at the end of a flight from London Stansted Airport with 189 passengers aboard, took evasive action to avoid a missile traveling toward it. the missile missed the airliner by about 1,000 feet (300 meters), and the plane landed safely. A UK investigation concluded that the missile was an Egyptian armed forces missile that had strayed from a military exercise, although the Egyptian government said the flight was never at risk.\nOn 31 October 2015, while flying from Sharm El Sheikh to Saint Petersburg, Metrojet Flight 9268 was destroyed by a bomb above the northern Sinai following its departure from Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, killing all 224 people on board, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for this incident. This caused the repatriation of British and Russian tourists from 5 November 2015. Following these events, many countries ordered all flights to Sharm El Sheikh be suspended. These suspensions were gradually lifted as the security situation improved, with the UK government ending its ban on direct flights on 22 October 2019. The process of lifting flight suspensions was completed on 9 August 2021, when the first direct flight from Russia since November 2015 (operated by Rossiya Airlines) landed at Sharm El Sheikh International Airport.\n\nTransport\nLampposts on El Salaam Street use solar power. Taxis and buses are numbered for safety.\nSharm's marina has been redeveloped for private yachts and sailing boats, with a passenger terminal for cruise ships.\nThe city is served by Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, the third largest airport in Egypt.\nSharm has frequent coach services to Cairo leaving from the Delta Sharm bus station.\n\nWater sports\nSharm El Sheikh has become a popular location for scuba diving as a result of its underwater scenery and warm waters. Other beach activities include snorkelling, windsurfing, kite-surfing, para-sailing, boating, and canoeing and stand up paddleboarding.\nRas Muhammad National Park is located at the southernmost tip of the Sinai Peninsula where the waters of the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez meet, producing strong currents and providing a habitat for diverse marine life. Two reefs popular with divers are Shark Reef, a vertical wall descending to over 800 metres (2,600 ft), and Yolanda Reef, the site of the wreck of the Yolanda.\nThe Straits of Tiran are located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba and in a major shipping lane. There are four reefs there, each named after one of the British cartographers who first mapped them: Gordan, Thomas, Woodhouse and Jackson. In summer months, hammerhead sharks swim in schools near the reefs.\nThe Sharm El Sheikh Hyperbaric Medical Center was founded in 1993 by the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism with a grant from USAID, to assist with diving-related medical conditions.\n\nShark attacks\nOn 1 December 2010, four tourists − three Russians and a Ukrainian − were attacked and injured by an oceanic whitetip shark or sharks in three separate incidents off Sharm El Sheikh. One victim lost a leg, and another an arm. The Egyptian authorities claimed that the shark responsible for the attacks had been captured alive, but the identification was disputed by the diving industry, based on eyewitness and photographic evidence. Four days later, on 5 December, an elderly German woman was attacked and killed by a shark while snorkeling at the resort.\n\nEducation\nSt. Joseph Schools\nL'école française de Sharm el Sheikh EFSSH (FRENCH SCHOOL)\nFayroz Experimental School\nGeel October School\nSharm College\nSharm British School\nKing Salman International University, Sharm El Sheikh campus\n\nTwin towns\nAqaba,  Jordan (since December 2015)\nSwakopmund,  Namibia (since June 2008)\n\nGallery\nSee also\nRed Sea Riviera\nSharm El Sheikh Memorandum\nSouth Sinai Hospital\nRas Sedr\nRas Muhammad National Park\nDahab\nTaba\nNuweiba\nFlash Airlines Flight 604\n\nReferences\nNotes\nExternal links\n Media related to Sharm el-Sheikh at Wikimedia Commons\n\nSharm El Sheikh - Egyptian Tourism Authority",

          "content": "Hurghada (; Arabic: الغردقة al-Ġhardaqah, Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [el ɣæɾˈdæʔæ]) is a coastal city that serves as the largest city and capital of the Red Sea Governorate of Egypt. Hurghada has grown from a small fishing village to one of the largest resort destinations along the Red Sea coast, stretching close to 40 km.\nThe city is bordered to the north by Ras Gharib, to the south by Safaga, to the east by the Red Sea coast, and to the west by the Red Sea Mountains. The city's nearest airport is Hurghada International Airport. Hurghada contains the islands of Giftun, Umm Qamar, Magawish, Abu Ramada, Abu Minqar, Fanadir, and Shadwan. The Hurghada metropolitan area is home to famous resort cities and towns that include El Gouna, Sahl Hasheesh, Soma Bay, and Makadi Bay. Its main districts are El Dahar, El Saqqala, and El Ahyaa.\nThe city by itself is famous for its luxurious and large hotels. As of 2024, Hurghada attracts over 9 million visitors annually, making it one of the most visited cities in Egypt and consistently ranking among the world's top tourist destinations and the third best nature destination in the world.\n\nEtymology\nThe city's name is derived from the Arabic name of the Nitraria plant (Arabic: غردق, romanized: ghardaq). The English Hurghada comes from gharqad (Arabic: غرقد), a variant of the same name. The tree is mentioned in a hadith, where it is called the \"tree of the Jews\".\n\nOverview\nHurghada was founded in the early 20th century. For many decades it was a small fishing village, but it has grown into a major Red Sea resort as a result of Egyptian and foreign investment that began in the 1980s. Holiday resorts and hotels provide facilities for windsurfing, kitesurfing, yachting, scuba diving and snorkeling. The city is known for its watersports, nightlife and warm weather. Daytime temperatures are around 35 °C (95 °F) most of the year, and during July and August temperatures can reach over 46 °C (115 °F). Hurghada is a popular holiday destination for Europeans, especially during the winter, and some spend Christmas and New Year there.\nIn recent years, Hurghada has also become a gateway for day trips and excursions to destinations such as Luxor and Cairo offered by various local tour operators.\nHurghada extends for about 36 kilometres (22 mi) along the coast, but does not reach far into the surrounding desert. The resort is a destination for Egyptian tourists from Cairo, the Delta and Upper Egypt, as well as package holiday tourists from Europe.\nMany of Hurghada's newer hotels, restaurants, and shops are located along El Mamsha. Most of the largest hotel resorts are located in the area between Mamsha and Sahl Hasheesh on El Mamsha. Beyond Sahl Hasheesh there are the hotels of Makadi Bay. Dahar is considered the oldest part of the town, where the traditional bazaar, post office and long-distance bus stations (Go Bus and Upper Egypt Bus) are situated. Sakala could be considered older because, it was the place where Hurghada was established by Ababda fishermen and where they settled along a natural harbor. The busiest area is also Sakala, the city center on Sheraton Road lined with hotels, shops and restaurants.\n\nHistory\nThe Egyptian Red Sea coast has been inhabited since antiquity, with the  area of Hurghada being occupied since the 4th century, when the ancient settlement of Abu Sha’ar (Arabic: ابو شعر), located 20 km north of the modern city, was established. Originally founded as a Roman military fort for Ala Nova Maximiana unit between 309-311, it was transformed into a Christian community around 400. The Christians repurposed the fort into a church, leaving behind inscriptions, graffiti, and artifacts such as a 5th-century papyrus and a tapestry with a cross. The settlement declined after either the Sasanian or Arab conquest of Egypt.\nThe modern city Hurghada was established in 1905 as a fishing village by Ababda fishermen along a natural harbor. Oil was discovered in the area in 1913 by Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields Ltd. During the reign of King Farouk a recreational center was built in the city, but after President Nasser's nationalization of Egypt's industries it was reallocated to the Egyptian Armed Forces.\nDuring the War of Attrition between Israel and Egypt (1967–70), Shadwan Island in the Red Sea to the east of the city was fortified by Egyptian troops and used as a radar post. On 22 January 1970 the island was the site of Operation Rhodes, a helicopter assault by Israeli troops who occupied it for 36 hours.\nDuring the October War of 1973, Hurghada harbor was the target of four Israeli operations.\nIn September 1994, drive-by shooters killed two Egyptians and a German tourist; another German man was wounded in the attack and died of his injuries after returning to Germany.\nIn 2016, a terrorist attack in Hurghada, inspired by the jihadist group Islamic State, wounded three tourists. In another terrorist attack in Hurghada in 2017, a man declared that he wanted to kill only non-Egyptians, and stabbed seven female tourists. Two German women and one Czech woman were killed in the attack, which took place at two separate resort hotels.\n\nTourism\nHurghada's major industry is foreign and domestic tourism thanks to its year-round hot and dry climate and long beaches. Its waters are clear and calm for most of the year, making Hurghada a popular destination for underwater diving and snorkelling. Al Mina Mosque with two 40-metre-high minarets is the largest mosque in the Red Sea Governorate. Hurghada Museum is the first antiquities museum in the Red Sea Governorate, containing 2000 artifacts that tell the history of Egypt. Hurghada Grand Aquarium opened in 2015, it is the largest aquarium in Egypt and the second largest in Africa (after uShaka Marine World).\nThere are diving sites around Giftun Islands, Abu Ramada Island and Fanadir where tourists can see shipwrecks such as the El Mina or the Rosalie Moller. Beyond the town the coast road passes through other holiday resorts and villages.\nTourism in Hurghada has had a negative impact on its coral reefs, as according to a study, the reefs have declined by 50% in three decades. The negative environmental consequences include oil spills, pollution, sewage, and dredging.\n\nTransport\nThe city is served by the Hurghada International Airport with scheduled passenger traffic connecting to Cairo and directly to several cities in Europe. It is Egypt's second-busiest airport.\n\nDemographics\nIn June 2015 MK in Egypt publisher Yulia Shevel stated that there were about 20,000 Russians in Hurghada, giving it Egypt's largest Russian population, though only about 3,000 were officially documented. Russian women staying in Hurghada often marry Egyptian men through an urfi (non-shariah) process. The city is also nicknamed Krasnomorsk by Russians, a name modelled on the Red Sea (Krasnoye More in Russian) and Russian city names like Krasnogorsk.\nHurghada has 4 schools for Russian children: Constellation (Созвездие), Our Traditions (Наши Традиции), Dina (Дина) and The World of Knowledge  (Мир знаний) (the Russian School Hurghada), as well as the newsletter MK in Egypt.  In 2017, a Russian Consulate opened in Hurghada.\n\nClimate\nHurghada has a subtropical-desert climate (Köppen climate classification: BWh), with mild-warm winters and hot to very hot summers. Temperatures in the period December–January–February are warm, but in the evenings temperature may drop from an average 20 Celsius degrees to 10. November, March and April are comfortably warm. May and October are hot and the period from June to September is very hot. The average annual temperature of the sea is 24 °C (75 °F), ranging from 21 °C (70 °F) in February and March to 28 °C (82 °F) in August.\n\nAlong the Red Sea coast, Hurghada has cooler temperatures in summer.\n\nResorts near Hurghada\nSahl Hasheesh\nSahl Hasheesh is a newly developed resort located 18 kilometres (11 mi) south of Hurghada on the Red Sea. It has clear long descending seas and is home to diverse marine life around artificial underwater walls.\n\nEl Qoseir\nEl Qoseir is one of the Egyptian gateways, and one of the oldest cities on the western coast of the Red Sea. In the past it was known by various names, such as Thagho in the pharonic period, Leucos Limen (white port in Greek) in the Hellenistic and Ptolemaic period, and Portus Albus in the Roman period. In the Islamic period it was given the name El Qoseir, which means \"a small palace or fortress\".\nLocated between Hurghada and Marsa Alam, El Qoseir used to be an important port. Many people traveled from there to the Land of Punt to buy ivory, leather and incense. During the Ottoman  and the Islamic periods, Egyptians and Muslims from North Africa traveled from El Qoseir as pilgrims to Mecca. It was also the only port importing coffee from Yemen. During the French occupation of Egypt, El Qoseir was the arrival point for Arabs and Muslims from Hejaz coming to fight beside the Mamluk against the French army. The most important sites in El Qoseir are the fort and the water reservoir. The water reservoir was El Qoseir's only source of drinking water 100 years ago.\nEl Qoseir El Adima, the city's historic area, was once a Roman port and hundreds of amphora and old pottery artefacts have been found there. There are several 300-year-old buildings in the area, including an Ottoman fort and a number of historic mosques: El Farran, El Qenawi and El Senousi.

          "content": "الغردقه هي العاصمه الاداريه لمحافظه البحر الاحمر، وتشغل مساحه 40 كم من الشريط الساحلي للشاطئ الغربي للبحر الاحمر. يحدها شمالاً مدينه راس غارب وجنوباً مدينه سفاجا وشرقاً ساحل البحر الاحمر وغرباً جبال البحر الاحمر. وتقع بها جزر الجفتون وام قمر ومجاويش وابو رماده وابو منقار والفنادير وشدوان، ومن اشهر منتجعاتها الجونه وسهل حشيش وسوما باي ومكادي باي، وتتمثل احيائها الرئيسيه في حي الدهار وحي السقاله وحي الاحياء.\n\nالتسميه\nاسم المدينه الاصلي «هرغاده» نسبه الى منطقه صحراويه تعرف باسم «ديشه هرغاده». وهناك راي اخر يقول بان الاسم يعود الى نبات يسمى «الغردق» وهو ما يعرف باسم «عنب الديب» او «فيروز الشطان» وهو نبات ينمو طبيعياً منذ القدم. وكان الصيادين من قبائل جهينه والرشايده والمعازه يصطادون في المنطقه ما بين الحجاز وساحل البحر الاحمر، ويتقابلون عند شجره كبيره لنبات «الغردق» ومكانها الحالي ميناء الغردقه البحري، ثم تطور الاسم الى الغردقه.\n\nالتاريخ\nنشات مدينه الغردقه عام 1905، لم تضم المدينه قديمًا الا مجموعه من المنازل البدائيه التي يسكنها البدو، والذين تمركزوا بصفه اساسيه في منطقه السقاله للعمل بصيد الاسماك واللؤلؤ، مما اكسب المدينه طابع بدوي مستمر معها حتى الان. وفي عهد الملك فاروق تم تشييد استراحه استجماميه تحولت بعد التاميم في عهد الرئيس جمال عبد الناصر الى مبنى نادي القوات المسلحه للرياضات المائيه والذي يعد مزاراً سياحياً حتى الان. واكتشف البترول في تلك المنطقه عام 1913 وبدا الانتاج الفعلي له وتصديره عام 1921، وكانت «شركه ابار الزيوت الانجليزيه المصريه المحدوده» من اوائل الشركات التي بدات في انتاج النفط بهذه المنطقه. وفي مطلع 1970 اغارت القوات الاسرائيليه على جزيره شدوان وتصدت لها القوات المسلحه المصريه بمساعده اهالي الغردقه، فيما يعرف بمعركه شدوان وهو التاريخ الذي تحتفل فيه محافظه البحر الاحمر بعيدها القومي.\n\nالجغرافيا والسكان\nتقع مدينه الغردقه على الشاطئ الغربي للبحر الاحمر على خط طول 48' 33° شرقاً وخط عرض 15' 27° شمالاً، وتتبع ادارياً محافظه البحر الاحمر، وهي عاصمه المحافظه. ويحدها شمالاً مدينه راس غارب بمسافه 143 كم، وجنوباً مدينه سفاجا بمسافه 61 كم، وتطل على ساحل البحر الاحمر من جهه الشرق، وغرباً على جبال البحر الاحمر، وتغطي شواطئها مساحه 40 كم من الشريط الساحلي للبحر الاحمر، وتبلغ مساحتها الكليه 460.5 كم وتعد المدينه الرابعه في الترتيب من حيث المساحه بين مدن محافظه البحر الاحمر بعد مدن راس غارب وسفاجا والقصير. وتمتد الكتله العمرانيه للمدينه على الطريق الساحلي الموازي لساحل البحر الاحمر في مسافه تقدر بـ 23 كم، بينما لا يزيد امتدادها للداخل عن 3.6 كم. تمتد مدينه الغردقه القديمه (الدهار) في شريط طولي، ينحصر بين هضبتين جيريتين، احداهما في الشرق بين المدينه القديمه والساحل، والاخرى في الغرب. لذلك تقع مدينه الغردقه في سهل ساحلي يتباين اتساعه من منطقه لاخرى، ويتراوح عرضه ما بين 8 الى 35 كم. ويظهر بذلك تعدد انماط النسيج العمراني للمدينه، فيتركز النسيج التلقائي والشبكي في نواه المدينه حيث عشوائيه العمران، والذي يتسم بالمباني الرديئه والمتوسطه المتلاحم معظمها، علاوه على ضيق وتعرج الطرق والشوارع التي يتراوح عرضها ما بين 3 الى 6 امتار تقريباً. اما النسيج الشبكي والشريطي المنظم فيسود في الامتدادات العمرانيه المستحدثه.\n\nالتقسيم الاداري\nحي الدهار: يعتبر المنطقه الشعبيه بالمدينه ومركزها القديم، حيث يبرز الحياه المصريه التقليديه الممزوجه بالطابع البدوي، كما انه يحتوي على الاسواق الشعبيه والمحلات التجاريه وسوق السمك، والطرق السياحيه مثل طريق الممشى وطريق الهضبه وطريق المطار وطريق الشيراتون.\nحي السقاله: يزين هذا الحي مكان الميناء القديم، ويمثل الرقعه السياحيه بالمدينه، حيث يقع به العديد من الفنادق والمحلات ومراكز التسوق والنوادي والمطاعم والتي تظل مفتوحه للجماهير والسياح الى بعد منتصف الليل.\nحي الاحياء: هو حي جديد من المتوقع له ان يكون من اهم الاحياء السياحيه في المستقبل، لاحتوائه على اكثر من منتجع سياحي تحت التاسيس.\nالجزر: تضم المدينه العديد من الجزر العامره المنتجعات السياحيه او التي تستخدم كمواقع للغطس مثل الجونه، سهل حشيش، مجاويش، ابو منقاره، ابو رماده، الجفتون، شدوان.\nالعشوائيات: يعيش نحو 30% من سكان المدينه في مناطق عشوائيه تحاول الدوله تطويرها وهي: زرزاره، جبل العفش، الملاحه، العنبر، نجع البوره، المحجر، الشيخ محمود، الصيادين، العرب، خلف الاوتوبيس والكهف.\n\nالمناخ\nتتمتع الغردقه بدرجه حراره معتدله طوال العام، فمناخها الصحراوي الجاف يؤدي الى اختلافات كبيره في درجات الحراره بين النهار والليل، حيث يكون الجو حار نهاراً وبارد ليلاً خاصه خلال اشهر الشتاء، وتصل اقصى درجات البروده الى 18 درجه مئويه وتبلغ ذروتها عند 42 درجه مئويه.\n\nالسكان\nتضاعف عدد سكان الغردقه بسبب الاستثمارات من 20 الف الى 90 الف نسمه، ويزيد على ذلك حوالي 40 الف شخص من العاملين القادمين من خارج المدينه للعمل بمجال السياحه. ويعود اصل سكان المدينه الى قبائل جهينه والرشايده والمعازه، ويتحدث معظمهم اللهجه الخليطه بين اللهجه البدويه واللهجه المصريه. ويقطن غالبيه السكان مركز الغردقه القديم بحي الدهار.\n\nالمعالم الطبيعيه والسياحيه\nتغطي مدينه الغردقه مساحه 40 كم من الشريط الساحلي للبحر الاحمر وتمتاز بشمسها الساطعه على مدار العام وشعابها المرجانيه الرائعه، بالاضافه الى عشرات من مواقع الجذب الممتعه التي يتجه اليها السائحين للاسترخاء والراحه لما تتمتع به المدينه من عوامل جذب منها درجه الحراره المعتدله طوال العام، ومناخها الصحراوي الجاف واشتمالها على ادوات المرح الشاطئيه والرياضات المائيه الممتعه والنوادي وملاعب الجولف. كما تزخر بالعديد من الجزر والمواقع البحريه التي تعتبر قبله لهواه الغطس والرياضات المائيه ومنها شعاب بليندا وشعاب ابو قطره وشعاب ابو نحاس وشعاب ام العش وشعاب ام قمر وشعاب العروف وشعاب طويله وابو نقاد وسيول.\n\nسوما باي\nانضم منتجع سوما باي او خليج ابو سوما الى حيز مدينه الغردقه في ابريل 2015. وهو عباره عن مجتمع سياحي يقع على بعد 60 كم من الطرف الشمالي لمدينه الغردقه، يمتد المنتجع على مساحه 13 مليون متر ليكوِّن خليجاً بديع القسمات مغلف بجمال الطبيعه العذراء. يتمتع المنتجع بالاكتفاء الذاتي وبتخطيط عمراني ومعماري ونوعيه خدمات تندمج مع ماهيه المكان المحيط به بلمسه اوروبيه في شكل فنادق وفيلات واماكن للرياضه والاستشفاء والترويح يمتلكها رجال اعمال مصريين وعرب. ويضم المنتجع ثلاثه مواقع رئيسيه هي «شيراتون» و«لاريزيدانس دي كاسادس» و«نادي روبينسون» بالاضافه الى نادي لممارسه رياضه الجولف.\n\nمكادي باي\nانضم منتجع مكادي باي او خليج مكادي الى حيز مدينه الغردقه في ابريل 2015. ويقع على بعد 35 كم جنوب وسط مدينه الغردقه. يتمتع المنتجع بشمس ساطعه على مدار العام وشواطئ ممتده من مياه البحر الصافيه والرمال البيضاء الطبيعيه، وهو احد منتجعات الغردقه المثاليه لقضاء العطلات وخوض الرحلات البحريه حيث تتراوح درجات الحراره في المنتجع ما بين 15 الى 23 درجه مئويه في شهور الشتاء، وبين 23 درجه الى 34 درجه في شهور الصيف والربيع. وتم تصميم المنتجع لتلبيه احتياجات السائحين المختلفه، حيث يضم مجموعه من الفنادق والمطاعم والاستراحات الفاخره التي تعمل على تقديم خدمه عالميه تتضمن مجموعه منتقاه من الماكولات الاسيويه والفرنسيه والايطاليه واليابانيه.\n\nكارلوس\nتعد شعاب كارلوس رييف احد اجمل مواقع الغطس في الغردقه، بفضل الغابات المرجانيه الكثيفه الموجوده بها واصناف الاسماك المتنوعه بمياهها مثل قرش المطرقه النادر واسماك الجاك والتونه والبركوده واسماك المواري العملاقه وغيرها. وتتكون شعاب تلك المنطقه من برجين مرجانيين يزيّنان سطح الماء. ويبلغ عمق الوادي بين هذين البرجين حوالي 16 متر، واكثر من 40 متر في المياه، مما جعلها منطقه مناسبه للغطاسين الهواه والمتمرسين.\n\nابو رمادا\nيحمل هذا الموقع ايضاً اسم «حوض الاسماك المائي»، ويتميز بمياهه الضحله نسبياً والمسطحه الى حد كبير، ويعج بالحياه البحريه المذهله والمتنوعه حيث تكثر فيه اسماك الشعاب الصغيره وسمك الراي اللاسع وقرش النمر، بالاضافه الى اسماك الجاك والبركوده وقرش الشعاب المرجانيه ذو الزعنفه البيضاء والتونه الصغيره باعداد كبيره.\n\nالفنادير\nالفنادير عباره عن شعاب ضيقه وطويله وهادئه تقع في شمال الغردقه ويمكن الوصول اليها من الجونه. وتتميز بامكانيه ممارسه اي نوع من انواع الغوص فيها بما في ذلك الغوص الانجرافي والغوص العميق وغوص المبتدئين، ويفضل الغواصون الجانب الشرقي من الفنادير لانه محمي من الطقس عن طريق قوس رقيق من الشعاب المرجانيه وبه الاجزاء الضحله من الشعاب المرجانيه حيث تزخر الحياه البحريه بالسمك الانبوبي (ابو زماره) والسمك الحجري وسمك عقرب البحر وسمك الخرمان وسمك الضفادع وسمك قرش الجيتار والسمك المفلطح وسمك ابو مطرقه وسمك التونه وسمك الجاك.\n\nسهل حشيش\nتبلغ مساحه منتجع سهل حشيش 32 مليون متر وتقوم على ادارته الشركه المصريه للمنتجعات السياحيه والتي قامت بتخطيطه على 3 مراحل بواقع 6 ملايين متر للمرحله الاولى و6 ملايين متر للثانيه و20 مليون متر للمرحله الثالثه. ويشتمل المنتجع على 1560 غرفه فندقيه و679 وحده سكنيه فيما ينتظر افتتاح 6 الاف غرفه فندقيه و6 الاف وحده سكنيه اضافيه تتضمنها مشروعات مستقبليه. كما يتضمن ايضاً مسرحاً مكشوفاً يشتهر بالحفلات الغنائيه الضخمه التي يقيمها كبار المطربين العرب ويحضرها الالاف من معجبيهم.\n\nالجونه\nتعود نشاه الجونه الى عام 1990، حيث طورتها شركه اوراسكوم للفنادق والتنميه على مجموعه من الجزر كاحد المنتجعات السياحيه الواقعه على ساحل البحر الاحمر، وتبعد عن مطار الغردقه الدولي 22 كم الى الشمال، ويفصلها عن القاهره مسافه 470 كم. وتتجه الجونه الى تحقيق الاكتفاء الذاتي من الغذاء عن طريق الاعتماد بشكل كبير على منتجات مزرعه الجونه المقامه على مساحه 120 فدان، والتي توفر احتياجات المنتجع من الخضراوات والفاكهه واللحوم والدواجن والاسماك بدون استخدام مبيدات. وتشتهر المنطقه بكونها موقعا للغطس في الاعماق والرياضات المائيه المختلفه، ويوجد بها شاطئان رئيسيان هما «زيتونه بيتش» و«مانجروفي بيتش»، ويتخلل المنتجع عدد كبير من القنوات المائيه، ويوجد به 6 احياء هي «حي مارينا تاون»، «الحي المتوسطي»، «حي الجولف»، «الحي النوبي»، «حي الهضبه»، و«الحي الايطالي». كما تتجه جميع الاستثمارات بالمنتجع الى الاعتماد على الطاقه الشمسيه النظيفه والاستغناء عن الكهرباء المولده من الحكومه بالكامل، وذلك عن طريق تخزين البطاريات للطاقه المولده من الخلايا الشمسيه. ويعتبر المنتج النموذج المثالي لممارسه رياضات الجولف والغوص والتزلج على الماء وركوب الامواج والطائرات الورقيه، كما يتمتع بالعديد من النوادي الصحيه والفنادق ذات الخمسه نجوم، فضلاً عن المناظر الطبيعيه الخلابه والطقس الممتع طوال العام.\n\nمتنفس الصحراء\nهو عباره عن تحفه فنيه تم بنائها في 7 مارس 1997 في صحراء الجونه، عن طريق مجموعه «D.A.ST. Arteam» التي تتكون من ثلاثه فنانين هم النحات «داناي ستراتو» والمصمم الصناعي «الكسندرا ستراتو» والمهندسه المعماريه «ستيلا قنسطنطينيدس». وهي عباره عن 89 من الكثبان الرمليه المخروطيه المرتفعه عن الارض و89 من الحفر المنخفضه الحلزونيه المزدوج متفاوته الحجم وتتوسطها بحيره قطرها 30 متر، وتقع هذه القطعه الفنيه على مساحه حوالي 100 الف متر.\n\nمجاویش\nتقع جزيره مجاويش على بعد 7.5 كم جنوب شرق الغردقه، وتمتلك نحو كيلومترين من الشواطئ ذات الرمال الناعمه التي تحتضن مياه البحر الاحمر البكر ذات الامواج الهادئه. وبها تقع قريه مجاويش السياحيه التابعه لشركه مصر للسياحه، التي تمتد على مساحه 850 الف متر منها 450 الف متر غير مستغله، وتعد اكبر قرى الغردقه واقدمها حيث افتتحها الرئيس الراحل انور السادات في عام 1979 في عهد وزير السياحه والطيران المدني جمال الناظر، ومحافظ البحر الاحمر علي عفيفي. ويقدم المنتجع العديد من الانشطه السياحيه والترفيهيه كالغطس وركوب الامواج والخيل، وتصنف القريه في فئه «اربعه نجوم» وتشتمل على 425 غرفه مقسمه الى شاليهات، بالاضافه الى مبنى فندقي وفيلات فاخره تمتد على طول الشاطئ الرملي الذي يبلغ طوله 1.2 كم ويعد الاطول في مدينه الغردقه، ويعمل بالقريه نحو 460 فرد تحت اداره مصريه خالصه.\n\nالجفتون\nتقع جزيره الجفتون على بعد 11 كم من شواطئ مدينه الغردقه، وتبلغ مساحتها اكثر من 17 كم، وتعد الجزيره الاكثر رواجاً سياحياً داخل نطاق مدينه الغردقه لما تمتلكه من شواطئ من طراز خاص، يفد اليها العشرات من السائحين يومياً لقضاء يوماً وسط البحر الاحمر. وتعد اهم اماكن الغوص في الاعماق والغوص السطحي بمدينه الغردقه ويستخدمها نسبه تزيد على 30% من ممارسي هذه الرياضه والنزلاء بفنادقها. كما تعتبر من اهم موارد الدخل لمحميات البحر الاحمر، وتلعب دوراً رئيسياً في النمو السياحي والاستثماري بمدينه الغردقه نظراً لانها الجزيره الوحيده التي يسمح بنزول السياح عليها. يغلب على الطبيعه الجيولوجيه للجزيره الارتفاع في نصفها الشمالي، حيث توجد سلسله من التلال يبلغ منسوب اعلاها 119 متر فوق مستوى سطح البحر تمتد من الشمال حتى منتصف الجزيره. اما الجزء الجنوبي للجزيره فهو عباره عن هضبه من الصخور المرجانيه يتراوح منسوبها من 3 الى 6 امتار ويحيط بسواحلها الشعاب المرجانيه الساحليه، وتمتد الى الغرب حتى جزيره ابو منقار والى الجنوب حتى جزيره جفتون الصغيره، والمياه فيما بين الجزر والساحل المقابل هي مياه ضحله لا يزيد عمقها على 20 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر، بينما يتعمق القاع الى الشرق منها، فيتراوح العمق بين 300 الى 500 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر. وتتكون صخورها من الصخور الرسوبيه حيث يصل سمك الرواسب بها الى حوالي 120 متر، والتي تتكون معظمها من صخور الحجر الجيري الرملي والشعب المرجانيه التي تنتمي الى عصر البليوسين. وتمثل الجزيره محميه طبيعيه تعد من اهم الاماكن التي تحتوي على انظمه بيئيه حساسه تتضمن الحشائش البحريه وتتميز بكساء وتنوع مرتفع للشعاب المرجانيه يتراوح بين 60% الى 90% في الاماكن المميزه، ويقطنها اعداد كبيره من الحيوانات البحريه والطيور التي يعتبر بعضها مهدد بالانقراض مثل العقاب النساريه والنوارس ذات العيون البيضاء (العجمه)، والتي تقوم بالتعشيش على الجزيره، كما يوجد في المنطقه الشماليه والشرقيه منها اماكن تعشيش السلاحف وعلى الاخص السلحفاه صقريه المنقار.\n\nجزيره ابو منقار\nتنتمي جزيره ابو منقار الى عصر الايوسين، مما يشير الى ان عمرها لا يقل عن 33 مليون سنه، وتتميز الجزيره بكثافه الصخور والتركيبات الجيولوجيه النادره بها. ويعود تسميه الجزيره الى شكلها العام حيث يشكل طرفها الشرقي لسان رملي يمتد داخل البحر بشكل متعرج يشبه الى حد كبير منقار الطير. وعلى رغم صغر حجمها النسبي، الا انها تعد من اهم جزر شمال البحر الاحمر، لاهميتها البيئيه نتيجه غناها بالشعاب المرجانيه والمانجروف. كما تستغل مناطق كثيره منها في انشطه الغوص والسياحه والصيد، فضلاً عن كونها محطه استراحه وتوالد لانواع عديده من الطيور المهاجره مثل النورس البحري ومالك الحزين وخطاف البحر والطائر الشماط. تقع الجزيره على مساحه 140 هكتاراً وتبعد عن مدينه الغردقه ثلاثه كيلومترات شرقاً، وتتشكل من ارض منبسطه من الشعاب المرجانيه المتحفره، سواحلها الغربيه والشماليه رؤوس صخريه بارزه وخلجان رمليه صغيره، وساحلها الجنوبي الشرقي شاطئ رملي منبسط خالي من التعرجات. وهي ضمن حدود محميه علبه البحريه التي تضم منطقه جبل علبه في جنوب شرق مصر اضافه الى جميع الجزر الواقعه في القطاع المصري من البحر الاحمر. وتعد الجزيره من اكثر جزر البحر الاحمر ثراءً باشجار المانجروف، حيث تزيد نسبه الغطاء النباتي الذي تحتله هذه الاشجار والنباتات الملحيه الاخرى عن ربع اجمالي مساحه الجزيره على مساحه تقدر بنحو 30 هكتاراً، حيث يمكن ان يحوي الهكتار الواحد ما لا يقل عن 400 شجره كامله، ويصل طول بعض تلك الاشجار الى اكثر من خمسه امتار، واحياناً تتخلل هذه الاشجار او تحيط بها انواع اخرى من النباتات المقاومه للملوحه مثل الغردق والرطريط والخريسه والسويده والمليح وغيرها من النباتات التي تميز بيئه السبخات الملحيه. وتنمو اشجار المانجروف على الجزيره خلال خور مائي كبير يمتد عبر الجزيره ويتفرع في اكثر من اتجاه، مشكلاً مع ايكات المانجروف الممتده على جنباته لوحه بحريه جميله يندر وجودها في اي جزيره اخرى. وتتميز اشجار المانجروف في تلك البقعه بوجودها في جزيره منعزله، بعيداً عن ضغوط الزحف العمراني والرعي الجائر والملوثات البشريه مما يسهم في زياده كثافه المانجروف ونمائه المستمر وطوله الوارف.\n\nجزيره شدوان\nجزيره شدوان هي اكبر جزيره شعاب مرجانيه في مضيق جوبال، وتعرف ايضاً باسم «جزيره شاكر». تضم الجزيره في الجزء الشمالي منها جدار من الشعاب المرجانيه شبه عمودي الشكل على عمق اكثر من 40 متر والذي يصل اليه الغواصين لاستكشافه عن طريق الغطس الانجرافي مع التيار المعتدل المتجه من الجنوب الى الشمال. وتزخر تلك الشعاب المرجانيه بسمك المرجان وسمك المروحه وسمك قرش الشعاب المرجانيه ذو الزعنفه البيضاء وسمك قرش الشعاب المرجانيه ذو الزعنفه الرماديه وسلاحف صقريه المنقار، بالاضافه الى اسراب الدلافين الرائعه.\n\nمعالم اسلاميه\nتم افتتاح مسجد الميناء في يناير 2012 اثناء احتفالات محافظه البحر الاحمر بعيدها القومي، واقيم على مساحه 4 الاف متر بتكلفه اجماليه 20 مليون جنيه بالجهود الذاتيه من المستثمرين والمواطنين وبدعم من محافظه البحر الاحمر ووزاره الاوقاف. ويعتبر المسجد من اكبر مساجد المحافظه، ويتميز بطراز معماري فريد يؤهله لان يصبح مزاراً سياحياً. وتم تخطيط المنطقه المحيطه به لتصبح ساحه حضاريه، ونقلت ورش اصلاح المراكب واللنشات حوله الى ترسانه اصلاح العائمات بمدينه سفاجا. كما تضم المدينه ايضاً ضريح ابى الحسن الشاذلي وهو احد المساجد التي انشات في عصر الدوله الايوبيه في مصر. ويتكون الضريح من مبنى مثمن الشكل بكل ضلع من اضلاعه نافذه واحده مستطيله والثانيه على شكل قماري، اما الضلع الثامن فيوجد به مدخل الضريح.\n\nمعالم قبطيه\nتضم الغردقه عده معالم قبطيه شهيره تتمثل في دير الانبا انطونيوس وهو اول دير انشئ في العالم وينسب اسمه الى الانبا انطونيوس الذي يعتبره الاقباط المصريون اول الرهبان في العالم، واب جميع الرهبان. تعود نشاه الدير الى القرن الرابع الميلادي ويعد واحداً من اهم واقدم الاديره الاثريه على مستوى العالم حيث يقع عند سفح جبل الجلاله القبليه جنوب السويس بنحو 170 كم، ويحتوي على مجموعه من اندر الجداريات القبطيه واروعها كما يحتوي على مكتبه كبيره تحتوي على 1438 مخطوطاً الى جانب مئات الكتب المطبوعه في مختلف فروع المعرفه. كما تضم الغردقه دير الانبا بولا او دير سانت بولا الواقع بالصحراء الشرقيه جنوب شرق دير الانبا انطونيوس، ويبتدئ طريق الدير حوالي 25 كم متفرعاً من طريق الزعفرانه الرئيسي، وممتداً الى الغرب مسافه 12,5 كم. ويوجد بالدير اربع كنائس اثريه هي: الكنيسه الاثريه التي كان يسكنها الانبا بولا لمده 70 سنه، وكنيسه ابو سفين التي اعاد بنائها المعلم الجوهري في اواخر القرن الثامن الميلادي، وكنيسه الملاك وبها اثني عشر قبه كعدد تلاميذ يسوع ويرجع تاريخها الى سنه 1777. وفي فبراير 2014 تم افتتاح مبنى خاص بزوار الدير في عهد البابا تواضروس الثاني وتضم المدينه ايضاً كاتدرائيه الانبا شنوده الواقعه بحي الدهار على مساحه 860 متر تقريباً، وتم انشائها في عام 1926، وكنيسه العذراء والملاك ميخائيل المقامه على الطراز الحديث بالجونه شمال مدينه الغردقه وتسع 1500 مصل، ودير مارمينا غرب مدينه الغردقه الذي يقع على مساحه 1500 متر، وكنيسه مارمرقس بحي الاحياء المقامه على مساحه 350 متر.\n\nوادي الحمامات\nوادي الحمامات او وادي الينابيع او ام الفواخير، هو عباره عن قاع نهر جاف اصبح طريقاً متعرجاً عبر جبال الصحراء الشرقيه، ويقع على بعد 235 كم من مدينه الغردقه، وكان يستخدم كطريق تجاري في العصور القديمه، وهي منطقه مُحاطه بمقالع حجاره البخن المعروفه بالجرايوكي ومناجم الذهب التي تمت الاستفاده منها منذ عصر المملكه القديمه وحتى العصر الروماني. وتتمثل المزارات السياحيه بالمنطقه في علامات المقالع على الجانب الشمالي من الطريق، حيث يظهر ما تبقى من اكواخ العمال القدماء. وعلى الجانب الجنوبي من الطريق، يوجد المئات من الالواح الهيروغليفيه التي تُعد دليلاً على البعثات والمهام الكثيره التي توجهت الى وادي الحمامات وكان يقودها الفراعنه.\n\nالاكواريم\nجراند اكواريم هو متحف يسلط الضوء على الحياه البحريه بمدينه الغردقه وتم افتتاحه في يناير 2015، ليعرض مجموعه كبيره من الكائنات البحريه، مع اتاحه التواصل معها والتعرف عليها عن قرب، حيث يحتوي على اكثر من 22 حوض من اكبر احواض الاسماك حجماً، وبه نفق زجاجي بطول 22 متراً، يمنح المارين به محاكاه طبيعيه للحياه البحريه خلال التجول تحت الماء من داخله. يتكون مشروع المتحف من ثلاث مراحل، تم افتتاح المرحله الاولى بطاقه استيعابيه تصل لاكثر من مليون جالون مياه ليكون الاكواريم السابع عالمياً من حيث كميه المياه، ومع انتهاء المرحله الثانيه تصل كميه المياه به الى 3.8 مليون جالون من المياه، وبذلك يصبح الثالث عالمياً، ومع المرحله الاخيره والثالثه يصبح «الاكواريم» الاول عالمياً بكميه مياه 8.8 مليون جالون. وشارك في تنفيذ المشروع العديد من الخبراء من اكثر من 5 دول مختلفه منها انجلترا، والمانيا وماليزيا، والصين، بالاضافه الى خبراء مصريين. يقع المشروع على مساحه 22 الف متر تقريباً، بالاضافه الى ساحه انتظار تقدر بحوالي 20 الف متر، ويبعد عن مطار الغردقه الدولي بضع دقائق.\n\nالمعهد القومي لعلوم البحار\nتم بناء المعهد القومي لعلوم البحار والمصايد في عام 1927 وافتتح رسمياً في العام التالي تحت اسم «محطه الاحياء البحريه» كاحد المنشات التابعه لجامعه فؤاد الاول (القاهره حالياً)، وتحول اسمه عام 1992 الى المعهد القومي لعلوم البحار والمصايد ليصبح تابعاً لوزاره البحث العلمي. وللمعهد ثلاثه افرع اخرى في الاسكندريه وخليج العقبه والقناطر يهتم كل منها بما له علاقه بعلوم البحار والبيئه البحريه. ويعد المعهد من اقدم المعاهد المتخصصه في مجال علوم البحار في الشرق الاوسط، وجاء اختيار منطقه شمال الغردقه كموقع للمعهد لبعدها عن العمران ولتوفر الشعاب المرجانيه والبيئه البحريه النموذجيه. ويحتوي المتحف على العديد من الاسماك المحنطه من بيئه البحر الاحمر والمحيط الهندي ومنها عروس البحر والدلافين والقروش والسلاحف وغيرها من الاسماك. ويضم الاكواريوم او حوض السمك الموجود بالمعهد سته وعشرين حوض زجاج لعرض الاسماك الحيه وخاصه اسماك الشعاب المرجانيه. ويشمل المعهد اثني عشر معمل ابحاث تغطي تخصصات عديده في مجال علوم البحار. ويضم المتحف سفينه ابحاث تحمل اسم حامد جوهر تخليداً لذكرى العالم المصري الدكتور حامد عبد الفتاح جوهر، وهي تقوم برحلات بحريه داخل محافظه البحر الاحمر لتجميع العينات واجراء الابحاث العلميه، فيما تعتبر مكتبه المعهد من اقدم المكتبات العلميه المتخصصه في مجال البيئه البحريه والمصايد في الشرق الاوسط وتحتوي على العديد من الكتب والمراجع والخرائط العلميه ذات القيمه الكبيره. كما يعمل المعهد على حل مشاكل البيئه البحريه المحيطه مثل مشكله نجم البحر الشوكي وعمل تقارير التقييم البيئي للمشروعات السياحيه على ساحل البحر الاحمر وفض المنازعات في المشاكل التي تمس البيئه البحريه بين جهاز شئون البيئه واصحاب المنشات السياحيه.\n\nمتحف الغردقه\nافتتح المتحف في 29 فبراير 2020 كاول متحف اثار مصري بالشراكه مع القطاع الخاص بتكلفه بلغت قرابه 160 مليون جنيه. تبلغ مساحه المتحف قرابه 10 الاف متر بينها 3 الاف متر مساحه قاعه العرض المتحفي الخاصه بالقطع الاثريه، والتي تضم 2000 قطعه اثريه من عصور مختلفه، فرعونيه ورومانيه وقبطيه واسلاميه، وقطع اثريه تعود لاسره محمد على.\n\nالاقتصاد\nالسياحه\nنظراً لطبيعتها الساحليه ظلت المدينه دائماً مقصداً سياحياً داخلياً وعالمياً يزوره الاف السائحين سنوياً، واعتمد اقتصادها بشكل رئيسي على السياحه والانشطه المكمله لها، وبها يعمل اغلب سكان المدينه. وتاثر هذا النشاط الغالب على طبيعه المدينه سلبياً بسبب الاضطرابات السياسيه التي خاضتها مصر. تتضمن دائره زائري المدينه العديد من الجنسيات يتمثل اغلبها في السائحين الاوروبيين القادمين من روسيا وهولندا وسلوفاكيا وبريطانيا والمانيا فضلاً عن السائحين القادمين من دول الخليج العربي. ويقضي معظم السياح يومهم صباحاً في السباحه والاستلقاء تحت اشعه الشمس بجانب المسبح او على شاطئ البحر، فيما يقضون لياليهم في النوادي الليليه خاصه تلك التي تقع في الجونه، فيما ينجذب البعض للنشاطات البحريه

          "content": "Marsa Alam (Arabic: مَرْسَىٰ عَلَم Marsā ʿAlam [ˈmæɾsæ ˈʕælæm], Classical Arabic lit. 'Anchorage Mountain') is a tourist town in south-eastern Egypt, located on the western shore of the Red Sea. It is described as a \"popular\" tourist destination.  Marsa Alam is a relatively recently built town; its development began in 1995 through the investments of the Kuwaiti Al-Kharafi Group, which established the town and its initial facilities, resorts and infrastructure. Its growth was accelerated by the opening of Marsa Alam International Airport in 2003.  Due to its crystal clear water and its white sandy beaches, it is also known as the \"Egyptian Maldives.\"\n\nGeography\nThe region covers an area of 38,433 km2 and sits at an elevation of approximately 60 meters above sea level.  It is located 274 km south of Hurghada and 134 km south of Qusayr. It is inhabited by about 11,497 residents.\n\nClimate\nDespite being over 135 miles (217 km) north of the tropical zone, the city experiences a tropical hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh), with steadier temperatures than places to the north such as Hurghada and Sharm el Sheikh. Among major Egyptian cities and resorts, Marsa Alam, Kosseir and Sharm el-Sheikh have the warmest nighttime temperatures. Average maximum temperatures during January typically range from 22 to 25 °C (72 to 77 °F) and in August 33 to 40 °C (91 to 104 °F).\nThe temperature of the Red Sea at this location during the year ranges from 22 to 29 °C (72 to 84 °F).\nThe highest record temperature was 45 °C (113 °F), recorded on May 10, 2010, while the lowest record temperature was 5 °C (41 °F), recorded on January 3, 2008.\n\nTourist activities\nBeaches near Marsa Alam include Abu Dabba.  There, tourists report seeing turtles, dolphins, sharks and marine wildlife like crocodilefish and octopuses.\nMarsa Alam is also known a kitesurfing destination and starting point for safaris.  The town is located near some historic emerald mines and the Temple of Seti I at Khanais.\n\nWadi El Gemal National Park\nThe Wadi El Gemal National Park covers an area of approximately 7,450 km2, including a land area of 4,770 km2, and a marine area of 2,100 km2. It covers 60 km of the Red Sea coast and includes the Wadi El Gemal islands, coral reefs and seaweed clusters, in addition to Mount Hamata, which is located at the beginning of the reserve. A flowing freshwater source mixes with seawater and forms a low-salinity marsh.\nThe reserve is divided into several areas: the Wadi El Gemal Island area, which is the second largest concentration of the sooty falcon; the Hankawareb area, which is 18 km south of Wadi El Gemal and is characterized by beaches and coral reefs; and the Qalaan area, which is 9 km north of the village. The Hamata area is characterized by the presence of vast areas of mangrove and many types of endemic and migratory birds.  The Hamata Islands area, which is located two miles from the beach opposite the village of Hamata, is characterized by places for practicing swimming and diving activities.\nThe valley was given its name due to the presence of a plant in that area that is palatable to camels.\nWildlife and marine life are active in the reserve, including mountain goat “ibex”, dorcas gazelle, which is also known as the afri, the aril gazelle, which is one of the smallest and most common species of deer, ibex, antelope, and more than 13 species of birds, including the sunset falcon.  Marine life includes four species of sea crab, dugong, green turtles, whale shark, mermaid fish, dolphin, and more than 13 species of small fish.  The local fauna includes 141 species of plants, including mangrove trees, swamp herbs, and doum palms.\nThe area also includes the Temple of Sket, located 60 km inside Wadi El Gemal. The reserve has four entrances, and three administrative offices have been established, in addition to a museum for the Ababda tribes in which the tools they use are displayed. Tribal women are also taught how to market and sell handicrafts. The Ministry of Environment provides patrols to enforce environmental law and provide environmental monitoring.\n\nTransportation\nMarsa Alam International Airport\nWork began on Marsa Alam International Airport in March 1999. It was opened for commercial aviation in October 2001, and it was officially opened in October 2003 with a capacity of up to 600 passengers/hour. It was established with the aim of serving the coastal region in the south of Red Sea from the city of Al-Qusayr to the city of Marsa Alam, with a length of 120 km. The airport is 34 nautical miles northwest of Marsa Alam, and 210 km south of Hurghada. Flights include origins in Italy, Germany, France and England for the purpose of tourism. The airport includes a passenger building located on an area of 5,000 square meters.\nThe airport is managed and operated by IMAC Airport Management and Operations Company, one of the Kuwait Al-Kharafi Group, using the build–operate–transfer system.\n\nYacht Marina\nMarsa Alam Bahri Marina or Port Ghalib Marina is located 65 km north of Marsa Alam City, 75 km south of El Quseir City, and 4 km south of Marsa Alam International Airport. Its total area is 315,872 m2, with a marine area of 277,872 m2. The combined length of its piers is 5,200 meters, and the ground area around the piers is 35,000 m2.

          "title": "Giza pyramid complex",
          "content": "The Giza pyramid complex (also called the Giza necropolis) in Egypt is home to the Great Pyramid, the pyramid of Khafre, and the pyramid of Menkaure, along with their associated pyramid complexes and the Great Sphinx. All were built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt, between c. 2600 – c. 2500 BC. The site also includes several temples, cemeteries, and the remains of a workers' village.\nThe site is at the edge of the Western Desert, approximately 9 km (5.6 mi) west of the Nile River in the city of Giza, and about 13 km (8.1 mi) southwest of the city centre of Cairo. It forms the northernmost part of the 16,000 ha (160 km2; 62 sq mi) Pyramid Fields of the Memphis and its Necropolis UNESCO World Heritage Site, inscribed in 1979. The pyramid fields include the Abusir, Saqqara, and Dahshur pyramid complexes, which were all built in the vicinity of Egypt's ancient capital of Memphis. Further Old Kingdom pyramid fields were located at the sites Abu Rawash, Zawyet El Aryan, and Meidum. Most of the limestone used to build the pyramids originates from the underlying Mokattam Formation.\nThe Great Pyramid and the Pyramid of Khafre are the largest pyramids built in ancient Egypt, and they have historically been common as emblems of Ancient Egypt in the Western imagination. They were popularised in Hellenistic times, when the Great Pyramid was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It is by far the oldest of the Ancient Wonders and the only one still in existence.\n\nMaadi settlements\nThe earliest settlement of the Giza plateau predates the pyramid complexes. Four jars from the Maadi culture were found at the foot of the Great Pyramid, likely from a disturbed earlier settlement. Further Maadi settlement near the site was uncovered during work on the Greater Cairo Wastewater Project. Recent reassessment of the radiocarbon dating puts the Maadi culture's eponymous settlement to c. 3800 – c. 3400 BC, which is also the likely maximum possible range for the Giza remains.\n\nPyramids and Sphinx\nThe Giza pyramid complex consists of the Great Pyramid (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu and constructed c. 2580 – c. 2560 BC), the slightly smaller Pyramid of Khafre (or Chephren) a few hundred metres to the south-west, and the relatively modest-sized Pyramid of Menkaure (or Mykerinos) a few hundred metres farther south-west. The Great Sphinx lies on the east side of the complex. Consensus among Egyptologists is that the head of the Great Sphinx is that of Khafre. Along with these major monuments are a number of smaller satellite edifices, known as \"queens\" pyramids, causeways, and temples. Besides the archaeological structures, the ancient landscape has also been investigated.\n\nKhufu's complex\nKhufu's pyramid complex consists of a valley temple, now buried beneath the village of Nazlet el-Samman; diabase paving and nummulitic limestone walls have been found but the site has not been excavated. The valley temple was connected to a causeway that was largely destroyed when the village was constructed. The causeway led to the Mortuary Temple of Khufu, which was connected to the pyramid. Of this temple, the basalt pavement is the only thing that remains. The king's pyramid has three smaller queens' pyramids (G1-a, G1-b, and G1-c) associated with it and three boat pits. The boat pits contained a ship, and the two pits on the south side of the pyramid contained intact ships when excavated. One of these ships, the Khufu ship, has been restored and was originally displayed at the Giza Solar boat museum, then subsequently moved to the Grand Egyptian Museum.\nKhufu's pyramid still has a limited number of casing stones at its base. These casing stones were made of fine white limestone quarried at Tura.\n\nKhafre's complex\nKhafre's pyramid complex consists of a valley temple, the Sphinx temple, a causeway, a mortuary temple, and the king's pyramid. The valley temple yielded several statues of Khafre. Several were found in a well in the floor of the temple by Mariette in 1860. Others were found during successive excavations by Sieglin (1909–1910), Junker, Reisner, and Hassan. Khafre's complex contained five boat-pits and a subsidiary pyramid with a serdab.\nKhafre's pyramid appears larger than the adjacent Khufu Pyramid by virtue of its more elevated location, and the steeper angle of inclination of its construction—it is, in fact, smaller in both height and volume. Khafre's pyramid retains a prominent display of casing stones at its apex.\n\nMenkaure's complex\nMenkaure's pyramid complex consists of a valley temple, a causeway, a mortuary temple, and the king's pyramid. The valley temple once contained several statues of Menkaure. During the 5th Dynasty, a smaller ante-temple was added on to the valley temple. The mortuary temple also yielded several statues of Menkaure. The king's pyramid, completed c. 2510 BC, has three subsidiary or queen's pyramids.\nOf the four major monuments, only Menkaure's pyramid is seen today without any of its original polished limestone casing.\n\nSphinx\nThe Sphinx dates from the reign of king Khafre. During the New Kingdom, Amenhotep II dedicated a new temple to Hauron-Haremakhet and this structure was added onto by later rulers.\n\nTomb of Queen Khentkaus I\nKhentkaus I was buried in Giza. Her tomb is known as LG 100 and G 8400 and is located in the Central Field, near the valley temple of Menkaure. The pyramid complex of Queen Khentkaus includes her pyramid, a boat pit, a valley temple, and a pyramid town.\n\nConstruction\nMost construction theories are based on the idea that the pyramids were built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place. Disagreements arise over the feasibility of the different proposed methods by which the stones were conveyed and placed.\nIn building the pyramids, the architects might have developed their techniques over time. They would select a site on a relatively flat area of bedrock—not sand—which provided a stable foundation. After carefully surveying the site and laying down the first level of stones, they constructed the pyramids in horizontal levels, one on top of the other.\nFor the Great Pyramid, most of the stone for the interior seems to have been quarried immediately to the south of the construction site. The smooth exterior of the pyramid was made of a fine grade of white limestone that was quarried across the Nile. These exterior blocks had to be carefully cut, transported by river barge to Giza, and dragged up ramps to the construction site. Only a few exterior blocks remain in place at the bottom of the Great Pyramid. During the Middle Ages (5th century to 15th century), people may have taken the rest away for building projects in the city of Cairo.\nTo ensure that the pyramid remained symmetrical, the exterior casing stones all had to be equal in height and width. Workers might have marked all the blocks to indicate the angle of the pyramid wall and trimmed the surfaces carefully so that the blocks fit together. During construction, the outer surface of the stone was smooth limestone; excess stone has eroded over time.\nNew insights into the closing stages of the Great Pyramid building were provided by the 2013 find of Wadi el-Jarf papyri, especially the diary of inspector Merer, whose team was assigned to deliver the white limestone from Tura quarries to Giza. The journal was already published, as well as a popular account of the importance of this discovery.\n\nPurpose\nThe pyramids of Giza and others are thought to have been constructed to house the remains of the deceased pharaohs who ruled Ancient Egypt. A portion of the pharaoh's spirit called his ka was believed to remain with his corpse. Proper care of the remains was necessary in order for the \"former Pharaoh to perform his new duties as king of the dead\". It is theorized the pyramid not only served as a tomb for the pharaoh, but also as a storage pit for various items he would need in the afterlife. The people of Ancient Egypt believed that death on Earth was the start of a journey to the next world. The embalmed body of the king was entombed underneath or within the pyramid to protect it and allow his transformation and ascension to the afterlife.\n\nAstronomy\nThe sides of all three of the Giza pyramids were astronomically oriented to the cardinal directions within a small fraction of a degree. According to the disputed Orion correlation theory, the arrangement of the pyramids is a representation of the constellation Orion.\n\nWorkers' village\nThe work of quarrying, moving, setting, and sculpting the huge amount of stone used to build the pyramids might have been accomplished by several thousand skilled workers, unskilled laborers and supporting workers. Bakers, carpenters, water carriers, and others were also needed for the project. Along with the methods used to construct the pyramids, there is also wide speculation regarding the exact number of workers needed for a building project of this magnitude. When Greek historian Herodotus visited Giza in 450 BC, he was told by Egyptian priests that \"the Great Pyramid had taken 400,000 men 20 years to build, working in three-month shifts 100,000 men at a time.\" Evidence from the tombs indicates that a workforce of 10,000 laborers working in three-month shifts took around 30 years to build a pyramid.\nThe Giza pyramid complex is surrounded by a large stone wall, outside which Mark Lehner and his team discovered a town where the pyramid workers were housed. The village is located to the southeast of the Khafre and Menkaure complexes. Among the discoveries at the workers' village are communal sleeping quarters, bakeries, breweries, and kitchens (with evidence showing that bread, beef, and fish were dietary staples), a copper workshop, a hospital, and a cemetery (where some of the skeletons were found with signs of trauma associated with accidents on a building site). The metal processed at the site was the so-called arsenical copper. The same material was also identified among the copper artefacts from the \"Kromer\" site, from the reigns of Khufu and Khafre.\nThe workers' town appears to date from the middle 4th Dynasty (2520–2472 BC), after the accepted time of Khufu and completion of the Great Pyramid. According to Lehner and the AERA team:\n\nThe development of this urban complex must have been rapid. All of the construction probably happened in the 35 to 50 years that spanned the reigns of Khafre and Menkaure, builders of the Second and Third Giza Pyramids.\nUsing pottery shards, seal impressions, and stratigraphy to date the site, the team further concludes:\n\nThe picture that emerges is that of a planned settlement, some of the world's earliest urban planning, securely dated to the reigns of two Giza pyramid builders: Khafre (2520–2494 BC) and Menkaure (2490–2472 BC).\nRadiocarbon data for the Old Kingdom Giza plateau and the workers' settlement were published in 2006, and then re-evaluated in 2011.\n\nCemeteries\nAs the pyramids were constructed, the mastabas for lesser royals were constructed around them. Near the pyramid of Khufu, the main cemetery is G 7000, which lies in the East Field located to the east of the main pyramid and next to the Queen's pyramids. These cemeteries around the pyramids were arranged along streets and avenues. Cemetery G 7000 was one of the earliest and contained tombs of wives, sons, and daughters of these 4th Dynasty rulers. On the other side of the pyramid in the West Field, the royals' sons Wepemnofret and Hemiunu were buried in Cemetery G 1200 and Cemetery G 4000, respectively. These cemeteries were further expanded during the 5th and 6th Dynasties.\n\nWest Field\nThe West Field is located to the west of Khufu's pyramid. It is divided into smaller areas such as the cemeteries referred to as the Abu Bakr Excavations (1949–1950, 1950–1951, 1952, and 1953), and several cemeteries named based on the mastaba numbers such as Cemetery G 1000, Cemetery G 1100, etc. The West Field contains Cemetery G1000 – Cemetery G1600, and Cemetery G 1900. Further cemeteries in this field are: Cemeteries G 2000, G 2200, G 2500, G 3000, G 4000, and G 6000. Three other cemeteries are named after their excavators: Junker Cemetery West, Junker Cemetery East, and Steindorff Cemetery.\n\nEast Field\nThe East Field is located to the east of Khufu's pyramid and contains cemetery G 7000. This cemetery was a burial place for some of the family members of Khufu.\nThe cemetery also includes mastabas from tenants and priests of the pyramids dated to the 5th Dynasty and 6th Dynasty.\n\nCemetery GIS\nThis cemetery dates from the time of Menkaure (Junker) or earlier (Reisner), and contains several stone-built mastabas dating from as late as the 6th Dynasty. Tombs from the time of Menkaure include the mastabas of the royal chamberlain Khaemnefert, the King's son Khufudjedef (master of the royal largesse), and an official named Niankhre.\n\nCentral Field\nThe Central Field contains several burials of royal family members. The tombs range in date from the end of the 4th Dynasty to the 5th Dynasty or even later.\n\nTombs dating from the Saite and later period were found near the causeway of Khafre and the Great Sphinx. These tombs include the tomb of a commander of the army named Ahmose and his mother Queen Nakhtubasterau, who was the wife of Pharaoh Amasis II.\n\nSouth Field\nThe South Field includes mastabas dating from the 1st Dynasty to 3rd Dynasty as well as later burials. Of the more significant of these early dynastic tombs are one referred to as \"Covington's tomb\", otherwise known as Mastaba T, and the large Mastaba V which contained artifacts naming the 1st Dynasty pharaoh Djet. Other tombs date from the late Old Kingdom (5th and 6th Dynasty). The south section of the field contains several tombs dating from the Saite period and later.\n\nTombs of the pyramid builders\nIn 1990, tombs belonging to the pyramid workers were discovered alongside the pyramids, with an additional burial site found nearby in 2009. Although not mummified, they had been buried in mudbrick tombs with beer and bread to support them in the afterlife. The tombs' proximity to the pyramids and the manner of burial supports the theory that they were paid laborers who took pride in their work and were not slaves, as was previously thought. Evidence from the tombs indicates that a workforce of 10,000 laborers working in three-month shifts took around 30 years to build a pyramid. Most of the workers appear to have come from poor families. Specialists such as architects, masons, metalworkers, and carpenters were permanently employed by the king to fill positions that required the most skill.\n\nShafts\nThere are multiple burial-shafts and various unfinished shafts and tunnels located in the Giza complex that were discovered and mentioned prominently by Selim Hassan in his report Excavations at Giza 1933–1934. He states: \"Very few of the Saitic [referring to the Saite Period] shafts have been thoroughly examined, for the reason that most of them are flooded.\"\n\nOsiris Shaft\nThe Osiris Shaft is a narrow burial-shaft leading to three levels for a tomb and below it a flooded area. It was mentioned by Hassan, and a thorough excavation was conducted by a team led by Hawass in 1999. It was opened to tourists in November 2017.\n\nNew Kingdom and Late Period\nDuring the New Kingdom Giza was still an active site. A brick-built chapel was constructed near the Sphinx during the early 18th Dynasty, probably by King Thutmose I. Amenhotep II built a temple dedicated to Hauron-Haremakhet near the Sphinx. As a prince, the future pharaoh Thutmose IV visited the pyramids and the Sphinx; he reported being told in a dream that if he cleared the sand that had built up around the Sphinx, he would be rewarded with kingship. This event is recorded in the Dream Stele, which he had installed between the Sphinx's front legs.\nDuring the early years of his reign, Thutmose IV, together with his wife Queen Nefertari, had stelae erected at Giza.\nPharaoh Tutankhamun had a structure built, which is now referred to as the king's resthouse.\nDuring the 19th Dynasty, Seti I added to the temple of Hauron-Haremakhet, and his son Ramesses II erected a stela in the chapel before the Sphinx and usurped the resthouse of Tutankhamun.\nDuring the 21st Dynasty, the Temple of Isis Mistress-of-the-Pyramids was reconstructed. During the 26th Dynasty, a stela made in this time mentions Khufu and his Queen Henutsen.\n\nDivision of the 1903–1905 excavation of the Giza Necropolis\nIn 1903, rights to excavate the West Field and Pyramids of the Giza Necropolis were divided by three institutions from Italy, Germany, and the United States of America.\n\nBackground\nPrior to the division of the Giza Plateau into three institutional concessions in 1903, amateur and private excavations at the Giza Necropolis had been permitted to operate. The work of these amateur archaeologists failed to meet high scientific standards. Montague Ballard, for instance, excavated in the Western Cemetery (with the hesitant permission of the Egyptian Antiquities Service) and neither kept records of his finds nor published them.\n\nItalian, German, and American Concessions at Giza\nIn 1902, the Egyptian Antiquities Service under Gaston Maspero resolved to issue permits exclusively to authorized individuals representing public institutions. In November of that year, the Service awarded three scholars with concessions on the Giza Necropolis. They were the Italian Ernesto Schiaparelli from the Turin Museum, the German Georg Steindorff from the University of Leipzig who had funding from Wilhelm Pelizaeus, and the American George Reisner from the Hearst Expedition. Within a matter of months, the site had been divided between the concessionaires following a meeting at the Mena House Hotel involving Schiaparelli, Ludwig Borchardt (Steindorff's representative in Egypt), and Reisner.\n\nDivision of the West Field\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the three largest pyramids on the Giza plateau were considered mostly exhausted by previous excavations, so the Western Cemetery and its collection of private mastaba tombs were thought to represent the richest unexcavated part of the plateau. George Reisner's wife, Mary, drew names from a hat to assign three long east-west plots of the necropolis among the Italian, German, and American missions. Schiaparelli was assigned the southernmost strip, Borchardt the center, and Reisner the northernmost.\n\nDivision of the Pyramids\nRights to excavate the Pyramids were then also negotiated between Schiaparelli, Borchardt, and Reisner. Schiaparelli gained rights to excavate the Great Pyramid of Khufu along with its three associated queens' pyramids and most of its Eastern Cemetery. Borchardt received Khafre's pyramid, its causeway, the Sphinx, and the Sphinx's associated temples. Reisner claimed Menkaure's pyramid as well as its associated queens' pyramids and pyramid temple, along with a portion of Schiaparelli's Eastern Cemetery. Any future disputes were to be resolved by Inspector James Quibell, as per a letter from Borchardt to Maspero.\n\nImmediate aftermath\nThis arrangement lasted until 1905, when, under the supervision of Schiaparelli and Francesco Ballerini, the Italian excavations ceased at Giza. As the Italians were more interested in sites which might yield more papyri, they turned their concession of the southern strip of the Western Cemetery over to the Americans under Reisner.\n\nModern usage\nIn 1978, the Grateful Dead played a series of concerts later released as Rocking the Cradle: Egypt 1978. In 2007, Colombian singer Shakira performed at the complex to a crowd of approximately 100,000 people. The complex was used for the final draw of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations and the 2021 World Men's Handball Championship.\nEgypt's Minister of Tourism unveiled plans for a €17,000,000 revamp of the complex by the end of 2021, in order to boost tourism in Egypt as well as make the site more accessible and tourist-friendly. According to Lonely Planet, the refurbishment includes a new visitors' centre, an environmentally-friendly electric bus, a restaurant (the 9 Pyramids Lounge), as well as a cinema, public toilets, site-wide signage, food trucks, photo booths, and free Wi-Fi. The new facility is part of a wider plan to renovate the 4,500 year old site.\n\nSee also\nEgyptian pyramids\nList of Egyptian pyramids\nList of largest monoliths, includes section on calculating weight of megaliths\nOutline of Egypt\nTeotihuacan\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nGiza Plateau\nPyramids in Giza – Pictures of Giza Pyramids published under Creative Commons License.\nWebsite of the Ancient Egypt Research Associates, researching Giza for over 30 years\n3D virtual tour explaining Houdin's theory Archived 28 July 2011 at the Wayback Machine (plug in needed)\nThe Giza Archives at Harvard University – since 2010, the Giza Archives Project website Archived 11 October 2008 at the Wayback Machine maintained by the Museum of Fine Arts, in Boston, has moved to Harvard University with an improved, expanded website.

          "summary": "The Giza pyramid complex (also called the Giza necropolis) in Egypt is home to the Great Pyramid, the pyramid of Khafre, and the pyramid of Menkaure, along with their associated pyramid complexes and the Great Sphinx. All were built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt, between c. 2600 – c. 2500 BC. The site also includes several temples, cemeteries, and the remains of a workers' village.\nThe site is at the edge of the Western Desert, approximately 9 km (5.6 mi) west of the Nile River in the city of Giza, and about 13 km (8.1 mi) southwest of the city centre of Cairo. It forms the northernmost part of the 16,000 ha (160 km2; 62 sq mi) Pyramid Fields of the Memphis and its Necropolis UNESCO World Heritage Site, inscribed in 1979. The pyramid fields include the Abusir, Saqqara, and Dahshur pyramid complexes, which were all built in the vicinity of Egypt's ancient capital of Memphis. Further Old Kingdom pyramid fields were located at the sites Abu Rawash, Zawyet El Aryan, and Meidum. Most of the limestone used to build the pyramids originates from the underlying Mokattam Formation.\nThe Great Pyramid and the Pyramid of Khafre are the largest pyramids built in ancient Egypt, and they have historically been common as emblems of Ancient Egypt in the Western imagination. They were popularised in Hellenistic times, when the Great Pyramid was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It is by far the oldest of the Ancient Wonders and the only one still in existence.",

          "content": "The Great Sphinx of Giza is a limestone statue of a reclining sphinx, a mythical creature with the head of a human and the body of a lion.\nThe monument was sculpted from the limestone bedrock of the Eocene-aged Mokattam Formation and faces east on the Giza Plateau, on the west bank of the Nile in Giza, Egypt. The oldest known monumental sculpture in Egypt, the Sphinx is part of the Memphite Necropolis and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nArchaeological evidence suggests the Sphinx was created by Egyptians of the Old Kingdom during the reign of Khufu (c. 2590–2566 BC) or Khafre (c. 2558–2532 BC). Scholars and Egyptologists believe the face of the Sphinx was carved to represent either the pharaoh Khufu or one of his sons, pharaohs Djedefre and Khafre, but a consensus has not been reached and the person(s) in whose likeness the Sphinx was carved remains in dispute.\nThe Sphinx has undergone multiple restorations, the most recent of which involved  replacing layers of limestone blocks around the base. The monument is 73 m (240 ft) long from paw to tail, 20 m (66 ft) high from the base to the top of the head, and 19 m (62 ft) wide at its rear haunches.\nThe circumstances of the destruction of the Sphinx's nose are unknown, but examinations of the face have shown evidence of a deliberate act with rods or chisels. Contrary to a popular myth, the nose was not destroyed by cannonfire from Napoleon's troops during his 1798 Egyptian campaign. Sketches and drawings predating Napoleon clearly detail the missing nose, and the damage is referenced in descriptions by 15th-century historian al-Maqrīzī.\n\nNames\nThe original name the Old Kingdom creators gave the Sphinx is unknown, as the Sphinx temple, enclosure, and possibly the Sphinx itself was not completed at the time, and thus little is known about its cultural context. In the New Kingdom, the Sphinx was revered as the solar deity Hor-em-akhet (English: \"Horus of the Horizon\"; Hellenized: Harmachis), and the 14th century BC pharaoh Thutmose IV specifically refers to it as such in his Dream Stele.\nThe commonly used name \"Sphinx\" was given to it in classical antiquity, around 2,000 years after the commonly accepted date of its construction by reference to a Greek mythological beast with the head of a woman, a falcon, a cat, or a sheep and the body of a lion with the wings of an eagle (although, like most Egyptian sphinxes, the Great Sphinx has a man's head and no wings). The English word sphinx comes from the ancient Greek Σφίγξ (transliterated: sphinx) apparently from the verb σφίγγω (transliterated: sphingo / English: to squeeze), after the Greek sphinx who strangled anyone who failed to answer her riddle.\nMedieval Arab writers, including al-Maqrīzī, call the Sphinx by an Arabized Coptic name Belhib (Arabic: بلهيب), Balhubah (Arabic: بلهوبه) Belhawiyya (Arabic: بلهويه), which in turn comes from Pehor (Ancient Egyptian: pꜣ-Ḥwr) or Pehor(o)n (Ancient Egyptian: pꜣ-Ḥwr(w)n), a name of the Canaanite god Hauron with whom the Sphinx was identified. It is also rendered as Ablehon on a depiction of the Sphinx made by François de La Boullaye-Le Gouz. The medieval Egyptian Arabic name is Abū il-Hawl (أبو الهول), meaning \"father of terror\", which may be a folk etymological reinterpretation of the name of the god Ḥwr. In other source the medieval Egyptian Arabic name is Abul-Hun.\n\nHistory\nOld Kingdom\nThe archaeological evidence suggests the Great Sphinx was created between 2600 and 2500 BC for the king Khufu, the builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza, or his son Khafre, the builder of the second Pyramid at Giza. The Sphinx is a monolith carved from the bedrock of the plateau, which also served as the quarry for the pyramids and other monuments in the area. Egyptian geologist Farouk El-Baz has suggested the head of the Sphinx may have been carved first, out of a natural yardang: a ridge of bedrock sculpted by the wind. These can sometimes achieve shapes resembling animals. El-Baz suggests the \"moat\" or \"ditch\" around the Sphinx may have been quarried out later to allow for the creation of the full body of the sculpture. The stones cut from around the Sphinx's body were used to construct a temple in front of it; however, neither the enclosure nor the temple were completed, and the relative scarcity of Old Kingdom cultural material suggests a Sphinx cult was not established at the time. Selim Hassan, writing in 1949 on recent excavations of the Sphinx enclosure, makes note of this circumstance:\n\nTaking all things into consideration, it seems that we must give the credit of erecting this, the world's most wonderful statue, to Khafre, but always with this reservation: that there is not one single contemporary inscription which connects the Sphinx with Khafre, so sound as it may appear, we must treat the evidence as circumstantial, until such time as a lucky turn of the spade of the excavator will reveal to the world a definite reference to the erection of the Sphinx. \nIn order to construct the temple, the northern perimeter wall of the Khafre Valley Temple had to be deconstructed; therefore, the Khafre funerary complex preceded the creation of the Sphinx and its temple. Furthermore, the angle and location of the south wall of the enclosure suggests the causeway connecting Khafre's pyramid and Valley Temple already existed before the Sphinx was planned. The lower base level of the Sphinx temple also indicates it does not pre-date the Valley Temple.\n\nNew Kingdom\nSome time around the First Intermediate Period, the Giza Necropolis was abandoned, and drifting sand eventually buried the Sphinx up to its shoulders. The first documented attempt at an excavation dates to c. 1400 BC, when the young Thutmose IV (1401–1391 or 1397–1388 BC) gathered a team and, after much effort, managed to dig out the front paws, between which he erected a shrine housing the Dream Stele, an inscribed granite slab (possibly a repurposed door lintel from one of Khafre's temples). When the stele was discovered, its lines of text were already damaged and incomplete. An excerpt reads:\n\n... the royal son, Thothmos, being arrived, while walking at midday and seating himself under the shadow of this mighty god, was overcome by slumber and slept at the very moment when Ra is at the summit [of heaven]. He found that the Majesty of this august god spoke to him with his own mouth, as a father speaks to his son, saying: Look upon me, contemplate me, O my son Thothmos; I am thy father, Harmakhis-Khopri-Ra-Tum; I bestow upon thee the sovereignty over my domain, the supremacy over the living ... Behold my actual condition that thou mayest protect all my perfect limbs. The sand of the desert whereon I am laid has covered me. Save me, causing all that is in my heart to be executed.\nThe Dream Stele associates the Sphinx with Khafre. However, this part of the text is not entirely intact:\n\nwhich we bring for him: oxen ... and all the young vegetables; and we shall give praise to Wenofer ... Khaf ... the statue made for Atum-Hor-em-Akhet.\nEgyptologist Thomas Young, finding the Khaf hieroglyphs in a damaged cartouche used to surround a royal name, inserted the glyph ra to complete Khafre's name. When the stele was re-excavated in 1925, the lines of text referring to Khaf flaked off and were destroyed. Later, Ramesses II the Great (1279–1213 BC) may have undertaken a second excavation.\nIn the New Kingdom, the Sphinx became more specifically associated with the sun god Hor-em-akhet (Hellenized: Harmachis) or \"Horus-at-the-Horizon\". The Pharaoh Amenhotep II (1427–1401 or 1397 BC) built a temple to the northeast of the Sphinx nearly 1,000 years after its construction and dedicated it to the cult of Hor-em-akhet.\n\nGraeco-Roman period\nIn Graeco-Roman times, Giza had become a tourist destination—the monuments were regarded as antiquities—and some Roman emperors visited the Sphinx out of curiosity and for political reasons. The Sphinx was cleared of sand again in the first century AD in honor of Emperor Nero and the Governor of Egypt Tiberius Claudius Balbilus. A monumental stairway—more than 12 metres (39 ft) wide—was erected, leading down to a pavement in front of the paws of the Sphinx. A podium positioned at the top of the stairs allowed a view into the Sphinx sanctuary. Farther back, another podium neighbored several more steps. The stairway was dismantled during the 1931–32 excavations by Émile Baraize. Pliny the Elder describes the face of the Sphinx being colored red and gives measurements for the statue:\n\nA stela dated to 166 AD commemorates the restoration of the retaining walls surrounding the Sphinx. The last emperor connected with the monument is Septimius Severus, around 200 AD. With the downfall of Roman power, the Sphinx was once more engulfed by the sands.\n\nMiddle Ages\nSome ancient non-Egyptians saw the Sphinx as a likeness of the god Hauron. The cult of the Sphinx continued into medieval times. The Sabians of Harran saw it as the burial place of Hermes Trismegistus. Arab authors describe the Sphinx as a talisman guarding the area from the desert. Al-Maqrizi describes it as the \"talisman of the Nile\" upon which locals believed the flood cycle depended. Muhammad al-Idrisi stated those wishing to obtain bureaucratic positions in the Egyptian government gave incense offering to the monument.\n\nEarly modern period\nOver the centuries, writers and scholars have recorded their impressions and reactions upon seeing the Sphinx. The vast majority were concerned with a general description, often including a mixture of science, romance and mystique. A description was made by John Lawson Stoddard:\n\nIt is the antiquity of the Sphinx which thrills us as we look upon it, for in itself it has no charms. The desert's waves have risen to its breast, as if to wrap the monster in a winding-sheet of gold. The face and head have been mutilated by Moslem fanatics. The mouth, the beauty of whose lips was once admired, is now expressionless. Yet grand in its loneliness, – veiled in the mystery of unnamed ages, – the relic of Egyptian antiquity stands solemn and silent in the presence of the awful desert – symbol of eternity. Here it disputes with Time the empire of the past; forever gazing on and on into a future which will still be distant when we, like all who have preceded us and looked upon its face, have lived our little lives and disappeared.\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, European observers described the Sphinx having the face, neck and breast of a woman.  Examples included Johannes Helferich (1579), George Sandys (1615), Johann Michael Vansleb (1677), Benoît de Maillet (1735) and Elliot Warburton (1844). Most early Western images were book illustrations in print form, elaborated by a professional engraver from either previous images available or some original drawing or sketch supplied by an author, and usually now lost. Seven years after visiting Giza, André Thévet (Cosmographie de Levant, 1556) described the Sphinx as \"the head of a colossus, caused to be made by Isis, daughter of Inachus, then so beloved of Jupiter\". He, or his artist and engraver, pictured it as a curly-haired monster with a grassy dog collar. Athanasius Kircher (who never visited Egypt) depicted the Sphinx as a Roman statue (Turris Babel, 1679). Johannes Helferich's (1579) Sphinx is a pinched-face, round-breasted woman with a straight-haired wig. George Sandys stated the Sphinx was a harlot; Balthasar de Monconys interpreted the headdress as a kind of hairnet, and François de La Boullaye-Le Gouz described the Sphinx as having a rounded hairdo with bulky collar. Richard Pococke's Sphinx was an adaptation of Cornelis de Bruijn's drawing of 1698, featuring only minor changes, but is closer to the actual appearance of the Sphinx than anything previous.  The print versions of Norden's drawings for his Voyage d'Egypte et de Nubie, 1755 clearly show the missing nose.\n\nModern excavations\nIn 1817, the first modern archaeological dig, supervised by the Italian Giovanni Battista Caviglia, uncovered the Sphinx's chest completely.\nIn the beginning of the year 1887, the chest, the paws, the altar, and plateau were all made visible. Flights of steps were unearthed, and finally accurate measurements were taken of the great figures. The height from the lowest of the steps was found to be one hundred feet, and the space between the paws was found to be thirty-five feet long and ten feet wide. Here there was formerly an altar; and a stele of Thûtmosis IV was discovered, recording a dream in which he was ordered to clear away the sand that even then was gathering round the site of the Sphinx.\nOne of the people working on clearing the sands from around the Great Sphinx was Eugène Grébaut, a French Director of the Antiquities Service.\n\nOpinions of early Egyptologists\nEarly Egyptologists and excavators had conflicting opinons regarding the age of the Sphinx and the associated temples. In 1857, Auguste Mariette, founder of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, unearthed the much later Inventory Stela (estimated to be from the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, c. 664–525 BC), which tells how Khufu came upon the Sphinx, already buried in sand. Although certain tracts on the stela are likely accurate, this passage is contradicted by archaeological evidence, thus considered to be Late Period historical revisionism, a purposeful fake, created by the local priests as an attempt to imbue the contemporary Isis temple with an ancient history it never had. Such acts became common when religious institutions such as temples, shrines, and priests' domains fought for political attention, and for financial and economic donations.\nIn 1883, Flinders Petrie wrote, regarding the state of opinion of the age of the Khafre Valley Temple, and by extension the Sphinx: \"The date of the Granite Temple has been so positively asserted to be earlier than the fourth dynasty, that it may seem rash to dispute the point. Recent discoveries, however, strongly show that it was really not built before the reign of Khafre, in the fourth dynasty.\" Gaston Maspero, the French Egyptologist and second director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, conducted a survey of the Sphinx in 1886. Maspero concluded because the Dream Stela showed the cartouche of Khafre in line 13, it was he who was responsible for the excavation and therefore the Sphinx must predate Khafre and his predecessors—possibly Fourth Dynasty, c. 2575–2467 BC. Maspero believed the Sphinx to be \"the most ancient monument in Egypt\".\nLudwig Borchardt attributed the Sphinx to the Middle Kingdom, arguing the particular features seen on the Sphinx are unique to the 12th dynasty and the Sphinx resembles Amenemhat III. E. A. Wallis Budge agreed the Sphinx predated Khafre's reign, writing in The Gods of the Egyptians (1904): \"This marvelous object [the Great Sphinx] was in existence in the days of Khafre, or Khephren, and it is probable that it is a very great deal older than his reign and that it dates from the end of the archaic period [c. 2686 BC].\" Selim Hassan reasoned the Sphinx was erected after the completion of the Khafre pyramid complex.\n\nModern dissenting hypotheses\nRainer Stadelmann, former director of the German Archaeological Institute in Cairo, examined the distinct iconography of the nemes (headdress) and the now-detached beard of the Sphinx and concluded the style is more indicative of the pharaoh Khufu (2589–2566 BC), known to the Greeks as Cheops, builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza and Khafre's father. He supports this by suggesting Khafre's Causeway was built to conform to a pre-existing structure, which, he concludes, given its location, could only have been the Sphinx.\nIn 2004, Vassil Dobrev of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale in Cairo announced he had uncovered new evidence the Great Sphinx may have been the work of the little-known pharaoh Djedefre (2528–2520 BC), Khafre's half brother and a son of Khufu. Dobrev suggests Djedefre built the Sphinx in the image of his father Khufu, identifying him with the sun god Ra in order to restore respect for their dynasty. Dobrev also says the causeway connecting Khafre's pyramid to the temples was built around the Sphinx, suggesting it was already in existence at the time. Egyptologist Nigel Strudwick responded to Dobrev, saying: \"It is not implausible. But I would need more explanation, such as why he thinks the pyramid at Abu Roash is a sun temple, something I'm sceptical about. I have never heard anyone suggest that the name in the graffiti at Zawiyet el-Aryan mentions Djedefre. I remain more convinced by the traditional argument of [the sphinx] being Khafre or the more recent theory of it being Khufu.\"\nGeologist Colin Reader suggests water runoff from the Giza plateau is responsible for the differential erosion on the walls of the sphinx enclosure. Because the hydrological characteristics of the area were significantly changed by the quarries, Reader contends this suggests the sphinx likely predated the quarries (and thus, the pyramids). He points towards the larger cyclopean stones in part of the Sphinx Temple, as well as the causeway alignment with the pyramids and the break in the quarries, as evidence the pyramids took the alignment with some pre-existing structure, such as the sphinx, into consideration when they were constructed, and the sphinx temple was built in two distinct phases. He contends such erosion could have occurred relatively rapidly and suggests the sphinx was no more than a few centuries older than present archaeology would suggest, suggesting a late Predynastic or Early Dynastic origin, when Ancient Egyptians already were known to be capable of sophisticated masonry.\n\nRecent restorations\nIn 1931, engineers of the Egyptian government repaired the head of the Sphinx. Part of its headdress had fallen off in 1926 due to erosion, which had also cut deeply into its neck. This questionable repair was by the addition of a concrete collar between the headdress and the neck, creating an altered profile. Many renovations to the stone base and raw rock body were done in the 1980s and then redone in the 1990s.\n\nDegradation and violation\nThe nummulitic limestone in the area consists of layers with varying resistance to the erosion caused primarily by wind and windblown sand, resulting in the uneven degradation evident in the body of the Sphinx. The lowest part of the body, including the legs, is solid rock. The middle body of the Sphinx has significantly disintegrated because the limestone from which it is comprised is softer than the surrounding rock, whereas the layer from which the head was sculpted is a harder limestone and therefore more resistant to erosion. Treasure hunters and tomb robbers have dug several \"dead-end\" shafts and passageways within and below the body of the Sphinx.\n\nMissing nose\nThe destruction and fate of the Sphinx's missing nose has long been the subject of myths and stories. Although false, the most popular story is the Sphinx's nose was destroyed by cannonballs fired by the army of Napoleon Bonaparte. However, drawings made by Frederic Louis Norden in 1737 show the Sphinx's nose missing, over 60 years before Napoleon's arrival.  Examination of the Sphinx's face shows marks made by long rods or chisels hammered into the face: one at the bridge of the nose, and another below the nostril. The nose was apparently then pried off, and the stonework crumbled as it fell or was subsequently destroyed.\nSome 10th-century Arab authors claimed the damaged nose was the result of iconoclastic attacks. Other writers have attributed the damage to the Mamluks in the 14th century. According to Ibn Qadi Shuhba, Muhammad ibn Sadiq ibn al-Muhammad al-Tibrizi al-Masri (d. 1384), desecrated the sphinxes of \"Qanatir al-Siba\".\nWriting in the early 15th century, Arab historian al-Maqrīzī attributed the loss of the nose to Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr, a Sufi Muslim from the khanqah of Sa'id al-Su'ada in 1378. According to al-Maqrīzī, Sa'im al-Dahr saw local peasants making offerings to the Sphinx in the hope of increasing their harvest and defaced the Sphinx in an act of iconoclasm. According to al-Maqrīzī, people living in the area believed the sand covering the Giza Plateau was retribution for al-Dahr's act of defacement. Al-Minufi (1443–1527) wrote the Alexandrian Crusade in 1365 was, \"...divine retribution for Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr's breaking off the nose of a sphinx.\"\n\nBeard\nThe Sphinx may have also had a ceremonial pharaonic beard, possibly added subsequent to the original construction. If the beard had been an original part of the Sphinx, Egyptologist Vassil Dobrev suggested the beard would have damaged the chin of the statue upon falling. Residue of red pigment is visible on areas of the Sphinx's face, and traces of yellow and blue pigment have been found elsewhere on the Sphinx, leading Mark Lehner to suggest the monument \"was once decked out in gaudy comic book colours\".\n\nHoles and tunnels\nHole in the Sphinx's head\nDuring his travels between 1565 and 1566, Johann Helffrich visited the Sphinx and described how a priest entered the head of the Sphinx, and when the priest spoke, it was as if the Sphinx itself was speaking. Many New Kingdom stelae depict the Sphinx wearing a crown. If it in fact existed, the hole could have been the anchoring point for it. Émile Baraize closed the hole with a metal hatch in 1926.\n\nPerring's Hole\nHoward Vyse directed John Shae Perring in 1837 to drill a tunnel in the back of the Sphinx, just behind the head. The boring rods became stuck at a depth of 27 feet (8.2 m). Attempts to blast the rods free caused further damage. The hole was cleared in 1978. Among the rubble was a fragment of the Sphinx's nemes headdress.\n\nMajor fissure\nA major natural fissure in the bedrock cuts through the waist of the Sphinx, first excavated by Auguste Mariette in 1853. At the top of the back it measures up to 2 metres (6.6 ft) in width. Baraize, in 1926, sealed the sides and roofed it with iron bars, limestone and cement, and installed an iron trap door at the top. The sides of the fissure might have been artificially squared; however, the bottom is irregular bedrock, about 1 metre (3.3 ft) above the outside floor. A very narrow crack continues deeper.\n\nRump passage\nIn 1926, the Sphinx was cleared of sand under direction of Baraize, which revealed an opening to a tunnel at floor-level at the north side of the rump. It was subsequently closed by masonry veneer and nearly forgotten. More than 50 years later, the existence of the passage was recalled by three elderly men who had worked during the clearing as basket carriers. This led to the rediscovery and excavation of the rump passage, in 1980.\nThe passage consists of an upper and a lower section, which are angled roughly 90 degrees to each other:\n\nThe upper part ascends to a height of 4 metres (13 ft) above the ground-floor at a northwest direction. It runs between masonry veneer and the core body of the Sphinx and ends in a niche 1 metre (3.3 ft) wide and 1.8 metres (5.9 ft) high. The ceiling of the niche consists of modern cement, which likely spilled down from the filling of the gap between masonry and core bedrock, some 3 metres (9.8 ft) above\nThe lower part descends steeply into the bedrock toward northeast, for a distance of approximately 4 metres (13 ft) and a depth of 5 metres (16 ft). It terminated in a cul-de-sac pit at groundwater level. At the entrance it is 1.3 metres (4.3 ft) wide, narrowing to about 1.07 metres (3.5 ft) towards the end. Among the sand and stone fragments, a piece of tin foil and the base of a modern ceramic water jar was found. The clogged bottom contained modern fill. Among it, more tin foil, modern cement and a pair of shoes\nIt is possible the entire passage was cut top down, beginning high up on the rump, and the current access point at floor-level was made at a later date. In his diary (February 27 and 28, 1837), Vyse noted he was \"boring\" near the tail, which indicates him as the creator of the passage, as no other tunnel has been identified at this location. Another interpretation suggests the shaft is of ancient origin, perhaps an exploratory tunnel or an unfinished tomb shaft.\n\nNiche in northern flank\nA 1925 photograph shows a man standing below floor level in a niche in the Sphinx's core body. It was closed during the 1925–1926 restorations.\n\nGap under southern large masonry box\nAnother hole might have been at floor level in the large masonry box on the south side of the Sphinx.\n\nSpace behind Dream Stele\nThe space behind the Dream Stele, between the paws of the Sphinx, was covered by an iron beam and cement roof, which was fitted with an iron trap door.\n\nKeyhole Shaft\nAt the ledge of the Sphinx enclosure, a square shaft is located opposite the northern hind paw. It was cleared during excavation in 1978 by Hawass and measures 1.42 by 1.06 metres (4.7 by 3.5 ft) and about 2 metres (6.6 ft) deep. Lehner interprets the shaft to be an unfinished tomb and named it \"Keyhole Shaft\", because of cuttings in the ledge above the shaft shaped like the lower part of a traditional (Victorian era) keyhole, upside down.\n\nPseudohistory\nAlthough numerous ideas have been suggested to explain or reinterpret the origin and identity of the Sphinx, the ideas lack sufficient evidential support and/or are contradicted by such, and are therefore considered pseudohistory and pseudoarchaeology.\n\nAncient astronauts/Atlantis\nIn accordance with the ancient Egyptian solar cult, the Sphinx faces east towards the rising sun. The Orion correlation theory posits the Sphinx was built and aligned to face the constellation of Leo during the vernal equinox around 10,500 BC. Since no textual, factual, or archaeological evidence supports the theory, the idea is considered pseudoarchaeology.\nThe Sphinx water erosion hypothesis contends the main type of weathering evident on the enclosure walls of the Great Sphinx could only have been caused by prolonged and extensive rainfall, and must therefore predate the time of the pharaoh Khafre. The hypothesis was championed by René Schwaller de Lubicz, John Anthony West, and geologist Robert M. Schoch. However, due to archaeological, climatological, and geological evidence proving otherwise, the water erosion hypothesis is considered pseudoarchaeology by mainstream scholarship.\nAmong others, H. Spencer Lewis made claims and speculated about hidden chambers beneath the Sphinx. In the 1930s, Edgar Cayce specifically predicted a \"Hall of Records\" containing knowledge from Atlantis would be discovered under the Sphinx in 1998. Cayce's prediction fueled much of the fringe speculation about the Sphinx in the 1990s, and was subsequently abandoned when the hall was not found when predicted.\nAuthor Robert K. G. Temple postulated the Sphinx was originally a statue of the jackal god of funerals Anubis, and its face was recarved in the likeness of a Middle Kingdom pharaoh, Amenemhet II. Temple based his identification on the style of the eye make-up and headdress pleats.\n\nRacial characteristics\nUntil the early 20th century, it was suggested the face of the Sphinx had \"Negroid\" characteristics, as part of the now outdated historical race concepts.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nSphinx of Memphis\nSphinx of Taharqo\nAfrican lions in culture\nLion (heraldry)\nList of colossal sculpture in situ\nList of tallest statues\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n Media related to Great Sphinx of Giza at Wikimedia Commons\nRiddle of the Sphinx\nEgyptian and Greek Sphinxes\nEgypt—The Lost Civilization Theory\nThe Sphinx's Nose\nWhat happened to the Sphinx's nose?

          "summary": "The Great Sphinx of Giza is a limestone statue of a reclining sphinx, a mythical creature with the head of a human and the body of a lion.\nThe monument was sculpted from the limestone bedrock of the Eocene-aged Mokattam Formation and faces east on the Giza Plateau, on the west bank of the Nile in Giza, Egypt. The oldest known monumental sculpture in Egypt, the Sphinx is part of the Memphite Necropolis and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nArchaeological evidence suggests the Sphinx was created by Egyptians of the Old Kingdom during the reign of Khufu (c. 2590–2566 BC) or Khafre (c. 2558–2532 BC). Scholars and Egyptologists believe the face of the Sphinx was carved to represent either the pharaoh Khufu or one of his sons, pharaohs Djedefre and Khafre, but a consensus has not been reached and the person(s) in whose likeness the Sphinx was carved remains in dispute.\nThe Sphinx has undergone multiple restorations, the most recent of which involved  replacing layers of limestone blocks around the base. The monument is 73 m (240 ft) long from paw to tail, 20 m (66 ft) high from the base to the top of the head, and 19 m (62 ft) wide at its rear haunches.\nThe circumstances of the destruction of the Sphinx's nose are unknown, but examinations of the face have shown evidence of a deliberate act with rods or chisels. Contrary to a popular myth, the nose was not destroyed by cannonfire from Napoleon's troops during his 1798 Egyptian campaign. Sketches and drawings predating Napoleon clearly detail the missing nose, and the damage is referenced in descriptions by 15th-century historian al-Maqrīzī.",

          "content": "The Pyramid of Djoser, sometimes called the Step Pyramid of Djoser or Step Pyramid of Horus Netjerikhet, is an archaeological site in the Saqqara necropolis, Egypt, northwest of the ruins of Memphis. It was the first Egyptian pyramid to be built. The six-tier, four-sided structure is the earliest colossal stone building in Egypt. It was built in the 27th century BC during the Third Dynasty for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser. The pyramid is the central feature of a vast mortuary complex in an enormous courtyard surrounded by ceremonial structures and decoration.\nThe pyramid went through several revisions and redevelopments of the original plan. The pyramid originally stood 62.5 m (205 ft) tall, with a base of 109 m × 121 m (358 ft × 397 ft) and was clad in polished white limestone.  As of 1997 the step pyramid (or proto-pyramid) was considered to be the earliest large-scale cut stone construction made by man, although the nearby enclosure wall \"Gisr el-Mudir\" is suggested by some Egyptologists to predate the complex, and the South American pyramids at Caral are contemporary.\nIn March 2020, the pyramid was reopened for visitors after a 14-year restoration.\n\nDjoser\nDjoser was the first or second king of the 3rd Dynasty (c. 2670–2650 BC) of the Old Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2686 – c. 2125 BC). He is believed to have ruled for 19 years or, if the 19 years were biennial taxation years, 38 years. He reigned long enough to allow the grandiose plan for his pyramid to be realized in his lifetime.\nDjoser is best known for his innovative tomb,  which dominates the Saqqara landscape. In this tomb he is referred to by his Horus name Netjerikhet; Djoser is a name given by New Kingdom visitors more than a thousand years later. Djoser's step pyramid is astounding in its departure from previous architecture. It sets several important precedents, perhaps the most important of which is its status as the first monumental structure made of stone.\nThe social implications of such a large and carefully sculpted stone structure are staggering. The process of building such a structure would be far more labor-intensive than previous monuments of mud-brick. This suggests that the state, and therefore the royal government, had a new level of control of resources, both material and human.  Also, from this point on, kings of the Old Kingdom are buried in the north, rather than at Abydos.\nAlthough the plan of Djoser's pyramid complex is different from later complexes, many elements persist and the step pyramid sets the stage for later pyramids of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Dynasties, including the great pyramids of Giza. Though the Dynastic Egyptians themselves did not credit him as such, most Egyptologists credit Djoser's vizier Imhotep with the design and construction of the complex. This is based on the presence of his statue in the funerary complex of Djoser, his title of \"overseer of sculptors and painters\", and a comment made by the 3rd century BC historian Manetho claiming Imhotep was the \"inventor of building in stone\". Imhotep would later be deified and known as Asclepios by the Greeks.\n\nPrecedents\nDjoser's Pyramid draws ideas from several precedents. The most relevant precedent is found at Saqqara mastaba S3038 (c. 2900 BC). The substructure lay in a 4 m (13 ft) deep rectangular pit, and had mudbrick walls rising to 6 m (20 ft). Three sides were extended and built out to create eight shallow steps rising at an angle of 49°. This would have been an elongated step pyramid if the remaining side had not been left uncovered. In another parallel to Djoser's complex, to complete this mastaba complex a niched enclosure wall was erected.\n\nLayout\nDjoser's mortuary complex comprises the great trench, enclosure wall, colonnaded entrance, \"T\" temple, Sed festival complex, north and south pavilions, south tomb and court, western mounds, mortuary temple, and the crowning feature of it all, the step pyramid with its substructure. The complex was a landmark achievement for Egyptian architecture. It was the advent of the pyramidal form of the royal tomb and the first instance of the mass use of limestone in construction, replacing mudbrick which had been the staple building material prior. This shift to limestone – a hard, dense material compared to mudbrick – presented novel challenges to the architects, though they kept to earlier tradition, copying architectonic elements and carving them into the stone. For example, the Egyptians hand-carved 1,680  9 m (30 ft; 17 cu)-tall niches out of the limestone enclosure wall. In earlier projects, this element was built with wooden planks, ropes, and poles hung with reed mats. In a modern context, the same element would be built by laying out the blocks to form the recesses.\n\nStep pyramid\nThe crowning feature of the complex is the Step Pyramid which rises from the Saqqara plateau in six steps to a height between 60 m (200 ft; 110 cu) and 62.5 m (205 ft; 119.3 cu). This element was revised repeatedly in construction, going through a series of developmental phases that culminated in its step pyramidal form. These phases are traditionally labelled, following Jean-Philippe Lauer's excavations: M1, M2, M3, P1, P1', and P2.\nIn the early stages (M1 to M3) the structure had the form of a mastaba before alterations (P1 to P2) were made to create its step pyramidal form. In the first stage (M1), the mastaba had a square plan 63 m (207 ft; 120 cu) in length that rose to a height of 8.4 m (28 ft; 16 cu). This was built from a core of limestone blocks arranged in horizontal beds and bound with yellow or red clay. A 2.6 m (9 ft; 5 cu) thick casing of fine white Tura limestone was applied to the core arranged in the same horizontal manner. The outer blocks were inclined to ~82° and the top of the mastaba likely had a slightly convex shape. A second casing of fine white limestone was applied to this which increased the mastaba's base length to 71.5 m (235 ft; 136 cu) square (M2). The casing was 4.2 m (14 ft; 8 cu) thick at the base and 3.4 m (11 ft; 6.5 cu) thick at the peak and was about 0.525 m (2 ft; 1 cu) lower than the initial mastaba height. The outer blocks of this second coat also had a steeper incline at ~76°. The mastaba was then extended 8.4 m (28 ft; 16 cu) east to cover a series of eleven shafts 33 m (108 ft; 63 cu) deep that ended in passages that led west to the burial chambers of members of Djoser's family. This extension was built from locally sourced limestone rubble and cased by 1.5 m (5 ft; 3 cu) thick limestone coating that formed an extension of M2. The mastaba had a new, rectangular ground plan 71.5 m (235 ft; 136 cu) by 79.5 m (261 ft; 152 cu). At this stage the mastaba still peaked at 8.4 m (28 ft; 16 cu) in height, too short to be seen from outside the 10.5 m (34 ft; 20 cu) high enclosure wall.\nEgyptologists are split on the motivations behind the conception of the pyramidal form that the mastaba was converted into. Lauer believed that the alteration was made to have the tomb visible from Memphis. The fact of the mastaba's square plan led Rainer Stadelmann, however, to suggest that it was never the intended final form and that it was planned to be a pyramid from the outset. The conversion (P1) encased the mastaba (M3) extending its length by 5.76 m (19 ft; 11 cu) on each axis giving it a base length of 85.5 m (281 ft; 163 cu) by 77 m (253 ft; 147 cu). The alteration from mastaba to pyramid came with a shift in construction. The builders used larger and better quality, roughly dressed limestone blocks – but instead of horizontal beds, they built successive inclined accretion layers 2–3 m (6.6–9.8 ft) thick. These leaned on each other from opposite ends providing greater stability preventing a collapse. The whole was then cased in fine white limestone with a layer of packing in between. This phase of the pyramid had four steps that rose to a height of 42 m (138 ft; 80 cu). The decision was then made to expand the pyramid north and west from four to six steps (P1') which was then finished with a final layer of limestone casing (P2) that gave the pyramid its final form. On completion the step pyramid had a base length of 109 m (358 ft; 208 cu) by 121 m (397 ft; 231 cu) that rose to a height of 60–62.5 m (197–205 ft; 115–119 cu) and occupied a volume of 330,400 m3 (11,670,000 cu ft).\nMuch of the rock for the pyramid was likely quarried from the construction of the great trench. It is widely accepted that ramps would have been used to raise heavy stone to construct the pyramid, and many plausible models have been suggested. For transport, apparatuses like rollers were used in which the heavy stone could be placed and then rolled.\n\nPyramid substructure\nUnder the step pyramid is a labyrinth of tunneled chambers and galleries that total nearly 6 km in length and connect to a central shaft 7 m square and 28 m deep. These spaces provide room for the king's burial, the burial of family members, and the storage of goods and offerings. The entrance to the 28 m shaft was built on the north side of the pyramid, a trend that would remain throughout the Old Kingdom. The sides of the underground passages are limestone inlaid with blue faience tile to replicate reed matting. These \"palace façade\" walls are further decorated by panels decorated in low relief that show the king participating in the Heb-sed. Together these chambers constitute the funerary apartment that mimicked the palace and would serve as the living place of the royal ka.\nOn the east side of the pyramid, eleven shafts 32 m deep were constructed and annexed to horizontal tunnels for royal family members. These were incorporated into the pre-existing substructure as it expanded eastward. In the storerooms along here over 40,000 stone vessels were found, many of which predate Djoser. These would have served Djoser's visceral needs in the afterlife. An extensive network of underground galleries was located to the north, west and south of the central burial chamber and crude horizontal magazines were carved into these. Shafts I–V were used for the burials of royal family members; shafts VI–XI were used as symbolic tombs for the grave goods of royal ancestors from dynasties I–II. More than 40,000 vessels, bowls and vases made of various kinds of stone were found in these galleries. Royal names such as of kings Den, Semerkhet, Nynetjer and Sekhemib were incised on the pots. It is now thought that Djoser once restored the original tombs of the ancestors, and then sealed the grave goods in the galleries in an attempt to save them.\n\nBurial chamber\nThe burial chamber was a vault constructed of four courses of well-dressed granite. It had one opening, which was sealed with a 3.5 ton block after the burial. No body was recovered as the tomb had been extensively robbed. Lauer believes that a burial chamber of alabaster existed before the one of granite. He found evidence of limestone blocks with five pointed stars in low relief that were likely on the ceiling, indicating the first occurrence of what would become a tradition. The king sought to associate himself with the eternal North Stars that never set so as to ensure his rebirth and eternity.\n\nPyramid complex\nDjoser's Step Pyramid complex included several structures pivotal to its function in both life and the afterlife. A pyramid was not simply a grave in ancient Egypt. Its purpose was to facilitate a successful afterlife for the king so that he could be eternally reborn. The symbolism of the step pyramid form, which did not survive beyond the 3rd Dynasty, is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be a monumental symbol of the crown, especially the royal mortuary cult, since seven small step pyramids (that were not tombs) were built in the provinces. Another well accepted theory is that it facilitated the king's ascension to join the eternal North Star.\nThe main modern excavator of the Step Pyramid was Jean-Philippe Lauer, a French architect who reconstructed key portions of the complex. The complex covers 15 ha (37 acres) and is about 2.5 times as large as the Old Kingdom town of Hierakonpolis. Several features of the complex differ from those of later Old Kingdom pyramids. The pyramid temple is situated at the north side of the pyramid, whereas in later pyramids it is on the east side. Also, the Djoser complex is built on a north–south axis, whereas later complexes utilize an east–west axis. Furthermore, the Djoser complex has one niched enclosure wall, whereas later pyramids have two enclosure walls with the outside one being smooth and the inside one sometimes niched.\n\nGreat trench\nBefore the enclosure wall, Djoser's pyramid complex is surrounded by a trench dug into the underlying rock. At 750 m (2,460 ft; 1,430 cu) long and 40 m (130 ft; 76 cu) wide, the trench is the largest structure of this kind in the Memphis necropolis. It is rectangular in shape, oriented on the north–south axis. The trench resembles a 𓉔 (hieroglyph h) which represents the floorplan of a house. It is decorated with niches which are suggested by Nabil Swelim to have hosted the spirits of members of the king's court, there to serve the king in his afterlife. In parts, the trench doubles into two with distinct entries. These make accessing the enclosure wall more difficult, indicating its function as a safe-guard. Miroslav Verner suspects that a single entrance was built at the south-east corner granting access to the area.\n\nEnclosure wall\nThe complex is enclosed by a wall 10.5 m (34 ft) high that stretched for over 1.6 km (0.99 mi). This wall was built from a thick core of masonry that was encased with Tura limestone, wholly on the outside but partially on the inside. The external façade of the wall had a bastion at a regular interval of 4.1 m (13 ft) adorned with 1,680 hand-carved niches 9 m (30 ft) tall. Fourteen of these bastions were larger than the rest. These hosted false double-doors, while a fifteenth situated in the south-east corner of the east façade held the real entrance. The entrance was flanked by two towers leading to a passage past which lay the colonnaded entrance.\nThe enclosure wall design recalls the appearance of First Dynasty tombs, such as those found directly north of the complex and at Abydos. Alan Spencer compares the design to the panelled construction of the palace façade, which imitates bound bundles of reeds. Jean-Philippe Lauer suggests that the wall was modelled after the \"White Walls\" of Memphis, though Verner notes that the presence of so many doors renders this unlikely. Hermann Kees thought the fifteen doors were related to the sed festival and indicated its duration as being half a lunar month. The remaining doors are known as false doors, and were meant for the king's use in the afterlife. They functioned as portals through which the king's ka could pass between life and the afterlife.\n\nEntrance colonnade\nThe entrance colonnade led from the enclosure wall to the south court of the complex. It comprises two distinct passageways oriented approximately east–west. The first is a narrow 1.05 m (3.4 ft) wide by 6 m (20 ft) long corridor cut into the enclosure walls bastion. The ceiling blocks here were carved into the shape of tree trunks. This is followed by a wider corridor flanked by 40 limestone columns, arranged in pairs, that fronted projecting walls, which formed alcoves. The columns were each nearly 6 m (20 ft) tall and were fashioned to resemble bundled reeds that had between seventeen and nineteen ribs. They supported a limestone ceiling whose blocks carved again into the form of palm tree trunks. There are 24 alcoves which are suggested to have held statues of the king or perhaps, because of their number, a double statue of the king and a nome deity. Such statues are present in the monuments of the Fourth Dynasty, but no trace of them has been uncovered at Djoser's complex. The end walls of the alcoves had slits cut into them near the ceiling thus allow light to filter in. Near the beginning of the colonnade, at its eastern end, is a corridor which leads to the heb-sed court. Between the twelfth and thirteenth alcove is a \"transverse vestibule\" with a passage flanked by eight 5 m (16 ft) tall columns and cross-walls leading to a sanctuary. Lauer believes this chamber contained a statue of Djoser on a pedestal that bore his name and Imhotep's titles. The torso and base of this statue were found in the entrance colonnade. The west wall of the entrance colonnade has the form of an open door which leads into the south court.\n\nSouth court\nThe south court is a large court between the south tomb and the pyramid. Within the court are curved stones thought to be territorial markers associated with the Heb-sed festival, an important ritual completed by Egyptian kings (typically after 30 years on the throne) to renew their powers. These would have allowed Djoser to claim control over all of Egypt, while its presence in the funerary complex would allow Djoser to continue to benefit from the ritual in the afterlife. At the southern end of the court was a platform approached by steps. It has been suggested that this was a platform for the double throne. This fits into the theory proposed by Barry Kemp, and generally accepted by many, that suggests the whole step pyramid complex symbolizes the royal palace enclosure and allows the king to eternally perform the rituals associated with kingship. At the very south of the South Court lay the South Tomb.\n\nSouth tomb\nThe south tomb has been likened to the satellite pyramids of later dynasties, and has been proposed to house the ka in the afterlife. Another proposal is that it may have held the canopic jar with the king's organs, but this does not follow later trends where the canopic jar is found in the same place as the body. These proposals stem from the fact that the granite burial vault is much too small to have facilitated an actual burial.\nThe substructure of the south tomb is entered through a tunnel-like corridor with a staircase that descends about 30 m before opening up into the pink granite burial chamber. The staircase then continues east and leads to a gallery that imitates the blue chambers below the step pyramid.\nCurrent evidence suggests that the south tomb was finished before the pyramid. The symbolic king's inner palace, decorated in blue faience, is much more complete than that of the pyramid. Three chambers of this substructure are decorated in blue faience to imitate reed-mat facades, just like the pyramid. One room is decorated with three finely niche reliefs of the king, one depicting him running the Heb-sed. Importantly, Egyptian builders chose to employ their most skilled artisans and depict their finest art in the darkest, most inaccessible place in the complex. This highlights the fact that this impressive craftsmanship was not meant for the benefit of the living but was meant to ensure the king had all the tools necessary for a successful afterlife.\n\nNorth temple and serdab court\nThe northern (funerary/mortuary) temple was on the north side of the pyramid and faced the north stars, which the king wished to join in eternity. This structure provided a place in which the daily rituals and offerings to the dead could be performed, and was the cult center for the king. To the east of the temple is the serdab, which is a small enclosed structure that housed the ka statue. The king's ka inhabited the ka statue, in order to benefit from daily ceremonies like the opening of the mouth, a ceremony that allowed him to breathe and eat, and the burning of incense. He witnessed these ceremonies through two small eye holes cut in the north wall of the serdab. This temple appeared on the north side of the pyramid throughout the Third Dynasty, as the king wished to go north to become one of the eternal stars in the North Sky that never set. In the Fourth Dynasty, when there was a religious shift to an emphasis on rebirth and eternity achieved through the sun, the temple was moved to the east side of the pyramid, where the sun rises, so that through association the king may be reborn every day.\n\nHeb-sed court\nThe Heb-sed court is rectangular and parallel to the South Courtyard. It was meant to provide a space in which the king could perform the Heb-sed ritual in the afterlife. Flanking the east and west sides of the court are the remains of two groups of chapels, many of which are dummy buildings, of three different architectural styles. At the north and south ends there are three chapels with flat roofs and no columns. The remaining chapels on the west side are decorated with fluted columns and capitals flanked by leaves. Each of the chapels has a sanctuary accessed by a roofless passage with walls that depict false doors and latches. Some of these buildings have niches for statues. Egyptologists believe that these buildings were related to the important double coronation of the king during the Heb-sed.\n\nSee also\nEgyptian pyramid construction techniques\nList of Egyptian pyramids\n\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nVirtual exploration of the colonnade\nVirtual exploration of the southern entrance of the Step Pyramid\nVirtual exploration of the burial chamber",

As of 1997 the step pyramid (or proto-pyramid) was considered to be the earliest large-scale cut stone construction made by man, although the nearby enclosure wall \"Gisr el-Mudir\" is suggested by some Egyptologists to predate the complex, and the South American pyramids at Caral are contemporary.\nIn March 2020, the pyramid was reopened for visitors after a 14-year restoration.",

          "content": "Dahshur (in English often called Dashur; Arabic: دهشور Dahšūr  pronounced [dɑhˈʃuːɾ]) is an ancient Egyptian pyramid complex and necropolis and shares the name of the nearby village of Manshiyyat Dahshur (Arabic: منشأة دهشور) in markaz Badrashin, Giza.\nDahshur is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is located on the Western Desert plateau at the edge of the cultivated plain, and along with the pyramid complexes at Saqqara, Abusir, and Giza,  to its north, forms the pyramid fields of the ancient capital city of Memphis. It is known chiefly for several pyramids, mainly Sneferu's Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid, which are among the oldest, largest and best preserved in Egypt, built from 2613 to 2589 BC.\n\nPyramids\nThe Dahshur pyramids were an extremely important learning experience for the Egyptians. It provided them with the knowledge and know-how to transition from step-sided pyramids to smooth-sided pyramids. Ultimately their breadth of experience would allow them to build the Great Pyramid of Giza; the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing to this date.\nThe first of the Dahshur pyramids was the Bent Pyramid (2613–2589 BC), built under the rule of King Sneferu. The Bent Pyramid was the first attempt at building a smooth sided pyramid, but proved to be an unsuccessful build due to the miscalculations made on the structural weight that was being placed onto the soft ground (sand, gravel, and clay), which had a tendency to subside. Other calculations that were proven to be erroneous were that the blocks being used were cut in such a manner that when placed onto the pyramid their weight was not distributed appropriately, causing the angle of the pyramid to be off and achieving the name \"the Bent Pyramid\".\nRealizing his shortcomings and learning from his mistakes, King Sneferu ordered the building of the second pyramid of Dahshur, the Red Pyramid. Once completed, the pyramid was considered to be a success, as it was a fully constructed, smooth sided, and a free standing pyramid rising to a height of 341 feet (104 meters), with an angle of 43 degrees. The Red Pyramid's name derives from the material that was used to construct the pyramid, red limestone. This pyramid is believed to be the resting place of King Sneferu.\n\nAnother pyramid, the White Pyramid, located within Dahshur is that of the 12th Dynasty King Amenemhat II (1929–1895 BC). This pyramid has not been preserved as well as the others within the area due to the materials that were used to fill it (sand on the outside and limestone on the inside). The weather caused the sand to erode from it, but the limestone was taken intentionally for use on other pyramids allowing the pyramid to collapse and ultimately desecrating the tomb of King Amenemhat II.\nKing Senusret III (1878–1839 BC) had his pyramid built within Dahshur. The difference between his pyramid in comparison to those surrounding it was that King Senusret III had tombs and galleries built underneath it for two princesses; Sit-Hathor and Merit.\nThe Black Pyramid dates from the later reign of Amenemhat III and, although badly eroded, it remains the most imposing monument at the site after the two Sneferu pyramids. The polished granite pyramidion or capstone of the Black Pyramid is on display in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.\n\nSeveral other pyramids of the 13th Dynasty were built at Dahshur. Only the Pyramid of Ameny Qemau has been excavated so far by Ahmad Fakhri, the archaeologist who excavated this site.\n\nTombs and cemeteries\nLocated closely to the pyramid of the 12th Dynasty several undisturbed tombs of royal women were found, containing a large amount of lapidary and jewelry that have been determined to be of the highest stage of metalworking in Egypt during this time period. The pyramid of Senusret III was part of a huge complex, with several smaller pyramids of royal women, along with another pyramid to the south. In a gallery tomb next to this pyramid were found two treasures of the king's daughters (Sithathor). Extensive cemeteries of officials of the Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom have been found around Dahshur's pyramids. Dahshur was Egypt's royal necropolis during the reign of the 12th Dynasty king Amenemhat II.\n\nContemporary history\nIn July 2012, Dahshur's entire Christian community, which some estimate to be as many as 120 families, fled to nearby towns due to sectarian violence. The violence began in a dispute over a badly ironed shirt, which in turn escalated into a fight in which a Christian burned a Muslim Arab clan member to death. Furthermore, during clashes another Muslim suffered head injuries and later died due to a gasoline bomb being thrown from a rooftop of a building. At least 16 homes and properties of Christians were pillaged, some were torched, and a church was damaged during the violence. This incident was reported internationally.\nAs of January 2013, and due to the security vacuum that still prevails in Egypt following the 2011 uprising, the site is under threat of desecration and damage due to encroachment by locals of surrounding urban settlements.\n\nClimate\nDahshur has a hot desert climate (BWh) according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system.\n\nSee also\nMemphite Necropolis\nList of ancient Egyptian towns and cities\nList of ancient Egyptian sites, including sites of temples\nList of megalithic sites\nAcanthus (Egypt), an old village in Dahshur mentioned in Ancient Greek literature.\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n\nInformation about Dahshur on the website of the German Archaeological Institute\nPhotos from inside the Bent Pyramid of Dahshur\nDahshur - Pyramid Breeding Ground\nDahshur\nNational Geographic Video on the Dahshur Pyramids",

          "content": "The Valley of the Kings, also known as the Valley of the Gates of the Kings, is an area in Egypt where, for a period of nearly 500 years from the Eighteenth Dynasty to the Twentieth Dynasty, rock-cut tombs were excavated for pharaohs and powerful nobles under the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt.\nIt is a wadi sitting on the west bank of the Nile, opposite Thebes (modern-day Luxor) and within the heart of the Theban Necropolis. There are two main sections: the East Valley, where the majority of the royal tombs are situated; and the West Valley, otherwise known as the Valley of the Monkeys.\nWith the 2005 discovery of a new chamber and the 2008 discovery of two further tomb entrances, the Valley of the Kings is known to contain 65 tombs and chambers, ranging in size from the simple pit that is KV54 to the complex tomb that is KV5, which alone has over 120 chambers for the sons of Ramesses II. It was the principal burial place for the New Kingdom's major royal figures as well as a number of privileged nobles. The royal tombs are decorated with traditional scenes from Egyptian mythology and reveal clues to the period's funerary practices and afterlife beliefs. Almost all of the tombs seem to have been opened and robbed in antiquity, but they still give an idea of the opulence and power of Egypt's pharaohs.\nThis area has been a focus for Egyptologists and archaeological exploration since the end of the 18th century, and its tombs and burials continue to stimulate research and interest. The Valley of the Kings garnered significant attention following the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, and is one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world. In 1979, it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site alongside the rest of the Theban Necropolis. Exploration, excavation, and conservation continues in the area and a new tourist centre has recently been opened.\n\nGeology\nThe Valley of the Kings is situated over 1,000 feet of limestone and other sedimentary rock, which form the cliffs in the valley and the nearby Deir el-Bahari, interspersed with soft layers of marl. The sedimentary rock was originally deposited between 35 and 56 million years ago during a time when the Mediterranean Sea sometimes extended as far south as Aswan. During the Pleistocene the valley was carved out of the plateau by steady rains. There is now little year-round rain in this part of Egypt, but there are occasional flash floods. These floods dump tons of debris into the open tombs.\nThe quality of the rock in the Valley is inconsistent, ranging from finely grained to coarse stone, the latter with the potential to be structurally unsound. The occasional layer of shale also caused construction (and in modern times, conservation) difficulties, as this rock expands in the presence of water, forcing apart the stone surrounding it. It is thought that some tombs were altered in shape and size depending on the types of rock the builders encountered. Builders took advantage of available geological features when constructing the tombs. Some tombs were quarried out of existing limestone clefts, others behind slopes of scree, and some were at the edge of rock spurs created by ancient flood channels.\nThe problems of tomb construction can be seen with the tombs of Ramesses III and his father Setnakhte. Setnakhte started to excavate KV11 but unintentionally broke into the tomb of Amenmesse, so construction was abandoned and he instead usurped the tomb of Twosret, KV14. When looking for a tomb, Ramesses III extended the partly excavated tomb started by his father. The tomb of Ramesses II returned to an early style, with a bent axis, probably due to the quality of the rock being excavated (following the Esna shale).\nBetween 1998 and 2002, the Amarna Royal Tombs Project investigated the valley floor using ground-penetrating radar and found that, below the modern surface, the Valley's cliffs descend beneath the scree in a series of abrupt, natural \"shelves\", arranged one below the other, descending several metres to the bedrock in the valley floor.\n\nHydrology\nThe area of the Theban hills is subject to infrequent, violent thunderstorms causing flash floods in the valley. Recent studies have shown that there are at least seven active flood stream beds leading down into the central area of the valley. This central area appears to have been flooded at the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty, with several tombs buried under metres of debris. The tombs KV55, KV62, and KV63 are dug into the actual wadi bedrock rather than the debris, showing that the level of the valley was five meters below its present level. After this event, later dynasties levelled the floor of the valley, making the floods deposit their load further down the valley, and the buried tombs were forgotten and only discovered in the early 20th century. This was the area that was the subject of the Amarna Royal Tombs Project ground-scanning radar investigation, which showed several anomalies, one of which was proved to be KV63.\n\nHistory\nThe Theban Hills are dominated by the peak of al-Qurn, known to the Ancient Egyptians as ta dehent, or \"The Peak\". It has a pyramid-shaped appearance, and it is probable that this echoed the pyramids of the Old Kingdom, more than a thousand years prior to the first royal burials carved here. Its isolated position also resulted in reduced access, and special tomb police (the Medjay) were able to guard the necropolis.\nWhile the iconic pyramid complex of the Giza Plateau have come to symbolize ancient Egypt, the majority of tombs were cut into rock. Most pyramids and mastabas contain sections which were cut into ground level, and there are full rock-cut tombs in Egypt that date back to the Old Kingdom.\nAfter the defeat of the Hyksos and the reunification of Egypt under Ahmose I, the Theban rulers began to construct elaborate tombs that reflected their newfound power. The tombs of Ahmose I and his son Amenhotep I (their exact location remains unknown) were probably in the Seventeenth Dynasty necropolis of Dra' Abu el-Naga'. The first royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings were those of Amenhotep I (although this identification is also disputed), and Thutmose I, whose advisor, Ineni, notes in his tomb that he advised the king to place his tomb in the desolate valley (the identity of this actual tomb is unclear, but it is probably KV20 or KV38).\n\nI saw to the excavation of the rock-tomb of his majesty, alone, no one seeing, no one hearing.\nThe Valley was used for primary burials from approximately 1539 BC to 1075 BC. It contains at least 63 tombs, beginning with Thutmose I (or possibly earlier, during the reign of Amenhotep I) and ending with Ramesses X or XI, although non-royal burials continued in usurped tombs.\nDespite its name, the Valley of the Kings also contains the tombs of favorite nobles as well as the wives and children of both nobles and pharaohs. Therefore, only about twenty of the tombs actually contain the remains of kings. The remains of nobles and of the royal family, together with unmarked pits and embalming caches, make up the rest. Around the time of Ramesses I (ca. 1301 BC) construction commenced in the separate Valley of the Queens.\n\nRoyal Necropolis\nThe official name for the site in ancient times was The Great and Majestic Necropolis of the Millions of Years of the Pharaoh, Life, Strength, Health in The West of Thebes (see below for the hieroglyphic spelling), or Ta-sekhet-ma'at (the Great Field).\n\nAt the start of the Eighteenth Dynasty, only kings were buried within the valley in large tombs. When a non-royal person was buried, it was in a small rock cut chamber, close to the tomb of their master. Amenhotep III's tomb was constructed in the Western Valley, and while his son Akhenaten moved his tomb's construction to Amarna, it is thought that the unfinished WV25 may have originally been intended for him. With the return to religious orthodoxy at the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty, Tutankhamun, Ay, and Horemheb returned to the royal necropolis.\nThe Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties saw an increase in the number of burials (both here and in the Valley of the Queens), with Ramesses II and later Ramesses III each constructing a massive tomb used for the burial of their sons (KV5 and KV3 respectively). There are some kings that are not buried within the valley or whose tomb has not been located: Thutmose II was buried in the nearby Western Wadis (although his mummy was included in the Deir el-Bahari tomb cache), Smenkhkare's burial has never been located, and Ramesses VIII seems to have been buried elsewhere.\nIn the Pyramid Age, the pyramid tomb of a king was associated with a mortuary temple located close to the pyramid. Since the tombs of the kings in the Valley of the Kings were hidden, the kings' mortuary temples were located away from their burial sites, closer to the cultivation facing Thebes. These mortuary temples became places visited during the various festivals held in the Theban necropolis. Most notable is the Beautiful festival of the valley, where the sacred barques of Amun-Re, his consort, Mut, and son, Khonsu, left the temple at Karnak in order to visit the funerary temples of deceased kings on the West Bank and their shrines in the Theban Necropolis.\nThe tombs were constructed and decorated by the workers of the village of Deir el-Medina, located in a small wadi between this valley and the Valley of the Queens, facing Thebes. The workers journeyed to the tombs through various routes over the Theban hills. The daily lives of these workers are quite well known due to their being recorded in tombs and official documents. Amongst the events documented is perhaps the first recorded workers' strike, detailed in the Turin Strike Papyrus.\n\nExploration of the valley\nThe valley has been a major focus of modern Egyptological exploration for the last two centuries. Prior to this time, it was a site for tourism in antiquity (especially during Roman times). The area illustrates the changes in the study of ancient Egypt, starting as antiquity hunting, and ending as scientific excavation of the whole Theban Necropolis. Despite the exploration and investigation noted below, only eleven of the tombs have actually been completely recorded.\nMany of the tombs have graffiti written by those ancient tourists. Jules Baillet has located over 2,100 Greek and Latin instances of graffiti, along with a smaller number in Phoenician, Cypriot, Lycian, Coptic, and other languages. The majority of the ancient graffiti is found in KV9, which contains just under a thousand of them. The earliest positively dated graffiti dates to 278 BC.\nIn 1799, members of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt (especially Vivant Denon) drew maps and plans of the known tombs, and for the first time noted the Western Valley (where Prosper Jollois and Édouard de Villiers du Terrage located the tomb of Amenhotep III, WV22). The Description de l'Égypte contains two volumes (out of a total of 24) on the area around Thebes.\nEuropean exploration continued in the area around Thebes during the nineteenth century. Early in the century, the area was visited by Giovanni Belzoni, working for Henry Salt, who discovered several tombs, including those of Ay in the West Valley (WV23) in 1816 and Seti I (KV17) the following year. At the end of his visits, Belzoni declared that all of the tombs had been located and nothing of note remained to be found. Working at the same time was Bernardino Drovetti, the French Consul-General and a great rival of Belzoni and Salt. John Gardner Wilkinson, who lived in Egypt from 1821 to 1832, copied many of the inscriptions and artwork in the tombs that were open at the time. The decipherment of hieroglyphs, though still incomplete during Wilkinson's stay in the valley, enabled him to assemble a chronology of New Kingdom rulers based on the inscriptions in the tombs. He also established the system of tomb numbering that has been in use, with additions, ever since.\nThe second half of the century saw a more concerted effort to preserve, rather than simply gather, antiquities. Auguste Mariette's Egyptian Antiquities Service started to explore the valley, first with Eugène Lefébure in 1883, then Jules Baillet and Georges Bénédite in early 1888, and finally Victor Loret in 1898 to 1899. Loret added a further 16 tombs to the list, and explored several tombs that had already been discovered. During this time Georges Daressy explored KV9.\n\nWhen Gaston Maspero was reappointed as head of the Egyptian Antiquities Service, the nature of the exploration of the valley changed again. Maspero appointed English archaeologist Howard Carter as the Chief Inspector of Upper Egypt, and the young man discovered several new tombs and explored several others, clearing KV42 and KV20.\nAround the start of the 20th century, American explorer Theodore M. Davis held the excavation permit for the valley. His team (led mostly by Edward R. Ayrton) discovered several royal and non-royal tombs (including KV43, KV46 and KV57). In 1907, they discovered the possible Amarna Period cache in KV55. After finding what they thought was all that remained of the burial of Tutankhamun (items recovered from KV54 and KV58), it was announced that the valley was completely explored and that no further burials were to be found. Davis's 1912 publication, The Tombs of Harmhabi and Touatânkhamanou closes with the comment, \"I fear that the Valley of Kings is now exhausted.\"\nAfter Davis's death early in 1915, Lord Carnarvon acquired the concession to excavate the valley, and he employed Howard Carter to explore it. After a systematic search, they discovered the actual tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62) in November 1922.\nVarious expeditions have continued to explore the valley, adding greatly to the knowledge of the area. In 2001 the Theban Mapping Project designed new signs for the tombs, providing information and plans of the open tombs.\n\nTomb development\nLocation\nThe earliest tombs were located in cliffs at the top of scree slopes, under storm-fed waterfalls (KV34 and KV43). As these locations were filled, burials descended to the valley floor, gradually moving back up the slopes as the valley bottom filled with debris. This explains the location of the tombs KV62 and KV63 buried in the valley floor.\n\nArchitecture\nThe usual tomb plan consisted of a long inclined rock-cut corridor, descending through one or more halls (possibly mirroring the descending path of the sun god into the underworld) to the burial chamber. In the earlier tombs, the corridors turn 90 degrees at least once (such as KV43, the tomb of Thutmose IV), and the earliest ones had cartouche-shaped burial chambers (for example, KV43, the tomb of Thutmose IV). This layout is known as \"Bent Axis\", After the burial, the upper corridors were meant to be filled with rubble and the entrance to the tomb hidden. After the Amarna Period, the layout gradually straightened, with an intermediate \"Jogged Axis\" (the tomb of Horemheb, KV57 is typical of this layout and is one of the tombs that is sometimes open to the public), to the generally \"Straight Axis\" of the late Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasty tombs (Ramesses III's and Ramesses IX's tombs, KV11 and KV6 respectively). As the tombs' axes straightened, the slopes also lessened. They almost disappeared in the late Twentieth Dynasty. Another feature that is common to most tombs is the \"well\", which may have originated as an actual barrier intended to stop flood waters from entering the lower parts of the tomb. It seems to have developed a \"magical\" purpose later as a symbolic shaft. In the later Twentieth Dynasty, the well itself was sometimes not excavated (by the builders), but the well room was still present.\n\nDecoration\nThe majority of the royal tombs were decorated with religious texts and images. The early tombs were decorated with scenes from Amduat ('That Which is in the Underworld'), which describes the journey of the sun god through the twelve hours of the night. From the time of Horemheb, tombs were decorated with the Book of Gates, which shows the sun god passing through the twelve gates that divide the nighttime and ensures the tomb owner's own safe passage through the night. These earliest tombs were generally sparsely decorated, and those of a non-royal nature were totally undecorated.\nLate in the Nineteenth Dynasty the Book of Caverns, which divided the underworld into massive caverns containing deities as well as the deceased waiting for the sun to pass through and restore them to life, was placed in the upper parts of tombs. A complete version appears in the tomb of Ramesses VI. The burial of Ramesses III saw the Book of the Earth, where the underworld is divided into four sections, climaxing in the sun disc being pulled from the earth by Naunet.\nThe ceilings of the burial chambers were decorated (from the burial of Seti I onwards) with what became formalised as the Book of the Heavens, which again describes the sun's journey through the twelve hours of night. Again from Seti I's time, the Litany of Re, a lengthy hymn to the sun god began to appear.\n\nTomb equipment\nEach burial was provided with equipment that would enable a comfortable existence in the afterlife. Also present in the tombs were items used to perform magic rituals, such as shabtis and divine figurines. Some of the items may have been used by the king during his lifetime (Tutankhamun's sandals for example), and some were specially constructed for the burial.\n\nTomb numbering\nThe modern abbreviation \"KV\" stands for \"Kings' Valley\". In 1827, Wilkinson painted KV numbers over the entrances to the 21 tombs that lay open in the East Valley at that time, beginning at the valley entrance and moving southward, and labeled four tombs in the West Valley as WV1 through WV4. The tombs in the West Valley were later incorporated into the East Valley numbering system as WV22 through WV25, and tombs that have been opened since Wilkinson's time have been added to the list. The numbers range from KV1 (Rameses VII) to KV64 (discovered in 2011). Since the early 19th century AD, antiquarians and archaeologists have cleared and recorded tombs, with a total of 61 sepulchers being known by the start of the 20th century. KV5 was only rediscovered in the 1990s after being dismissed as unimportant by previous investigators. Some of the tombs have ambiguous burial contexts, others remain unidentifiable as regards to their owners, and still others appear to be unfinished, reused, or of unknown function.\n\nEighteenth Dynasty\nThe Eighteenth Dynasty tombs within the valley vary quite a bit in decoration, style, and location. It seems that at first there was no fixed plan. The tomb of Hatshepsut has a unique shape, twisting and turning down over 200 metres from the entrance, so that the burial chamber is 97 metres below the surface. The tombs gradually became more regular and formalised, and those of Thutmose III and Thutmose IV, KV34 and KV43, are good examples of Eighteenth Dynasty tombs, both with their bent axis, and simple decoration.\nPerhaps the most imposing tomb of this period is that of Amenhotep III, WV22, located in the West Valley. It was re-investigated in the 1990s by a team from Waseda University, Japan, but it is not open to the public.\nAt the same time, powerful and influential nobles began to be buried with the royal family; the most famous of these tombs is the joint tomb of Yuya and Tjuyu, KV46. They were possibly the parents of Queen Tiy. Until the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun, this was the best-preserved of the tombs that had been discovered in the Valley.\n\nAmarna Period\nThe return of royal burials to Thebes after the end of the Amarna Period marks a change to the layout of royal burials, with the intermediate 'jogged axis' gradually giving way to the 'straight axis' of later dynasties. In the Western Valley, there is a tomb commencement that is thought to have been started for Akhenaten, but it is no more than a gateway and a series of steps. The tomb of Ay, Tutankhamun's successor is close by. It is likely that this tomb was started for Tutankhamun (its decoration is of a similar style), but later usurped for Ay's burial. This would mean that KV62 may have been Ay's original tomb, which would explain the smaller size and unusual layout for a royal tomb.\n\nThe other Amarna Period tombs are located in a smaller, central area in the centre of the East Valley, with a possible mummy cache (KV55) that may contain the burials of several Amarna Period royals – Tiy and Smenkhkare or Akhenaten.\nIn close proximity is the burial of Tutankhamun, perhaps the most famous discovery of modern Western archaeology. It was discovered by Howard Carter on 4 November 1922, with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This was the first royal tomb to be discovered that was still largely intact, although tomb robbers had entered. Until the excavation of KV63 on 10 March 2005, it was considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, Tutankhamun was a relatively minor king, and other burials probably had more numerous treasures.\nIn the same central area as KV62 and KV63, is \"KV64\", a radar anomaly believed to be a tomb or chamber announced on 28 July 2006. It was not an official designation, and the actual existence of a tomb at all was dismissed by the Supreme Council of Antiquities, prior to finally excavating and describing it during 2011–2012.\nThe nearby tomb of Horemheb, (KV57) is rarely open to visitors, but it has many unique features and is extensively decorated. The decoration shows a transition from the pre-Amarna tombs to those of the 19th dynasty tombs that followed.\n\nNineteenth Dynasty\nThe Nineteenth Dynasty saw a further standardisation of tomb layout and decoration. The tomb of the first king of the dynasty, Ramesses I, was hurriedly finished due to the early death of the king and is little more than a truncated descending corridor and a burial chamber. However, KV16 has vibrant decoration and still contains the sarcophagus of the king. Its central location makes it one of the more frequently visited tombs. It shows the development of the tomb entrance and passage and of decoration.\nHis son and successor, Seti I's tomb KV17 (also known as Belzoni's tomb, the tomb of Apis, or the tomb of Psammis, son of Necho), is usually regarded as the finest tomb in the valley. It has extensive relief work and paintings. When it was rediscovered by Belzoni in 1817, he referred to it as \"a fortunate day.\"\nThe son of Seti, Ramesses II (Ramesses the Great), constructed a massive tomb, KV7, but it is in a ruinous state. It is currently undergoing excavation and conservation by a Franco-Egyptian team led by Christian Leblanc. The tomb is vast in size, about the same length, and a larger area, of the tomb of his father.\n\nAt the same time, and just opposite his own tomb, Ramesses enlarged the earlier small tomb of an unknown Eighteenth Dynasty noble (KV5) for his numerous sons. With 120 known rooms, and excavation work still underway, it is probably the largest tomb in the valley. Originally opened (and robbed) in antiquity, it is a low-lying structure that has been particularly prone to the flash floods that sometimes hit the area. Tonnes of debris and material has washed in over the centuries, ultimately concealing its vast size. It is not currently open to the public.\nRamesses II's son and eventual successor, Merenptah's tomb has been open since antiquity; it extends 160 metres, ending in a burial chamber that once contained a set of four nested sarcophagi. Well decorated, it is typically open to the public most years.\nThe last kings of the dynasty also constructed tombs in the valley, all of which follow the same general pattern of layout and decoration. Notable amongst these is the tomb of Siptah, which is well decorated, especially the ceiling.\n\nTwentieth Dynasty\nThe first ruler of the dynasty, Setnakhte, had two tombs constructed for himself. He started excavating the eventual tomb of his son, Ramesses III, but abandoned that dig when it unintentionally broke into another tomb. He then usurped and completed the tomb of the Nineteenth Dynasty female pharaoh, Twosret, KV14. Therefore, this tomb has two burial chambers, the later extensions making this one of the largest of the Royal tombs, at over 150 metres. KV11 was later restarted and extended and on a different axis for Ramesses III.\n\nThe tomb of Ramesses III (KV11, known as Bruce's Tomb or The Harper's Tomb due to its decoration) is one of the largest tombs in the valley and is open to the public. It is located close to the central 'rest–area', and its location and superb decoration make this one of the tombs most visited by tourists.\nThe successors and offspring of Ramesses III constructed tombs that had straight axes. They all had similar decorations. Notable amongst these is KV2, the tomb of Ramesses IV, which has been open since antiquity, containing a large amount of hieratic graffiti. The tomb is mostly intact and is decorated with scenes from several religious texts. The joint tomb of Ramesses V and Ramesses VI, KV9 (also known as the Tomb of Memnon or La Tombe de la Métempsychose) is decorated with many sunk-relief carvings, depicting illustrated scenes from religious texts. Open since antiquity, it contains over a thousand examples of graffiti written in ancient Greek, Latin and Coptic. The spoil from the excavation and later clearance of this tomb, together with later construction of workers huts, covered the earlier burial of KV62 and seems to have been what protected that tomb from earlier discovery and looting.\n\nThe tomb of Ramesses IX, KV6, has been open since antiquity, as can be seen by the graffiti left on its walls by Roman and Coptic visitors. Located in the central part of the valley, it is between and slightly above KV5 and KV55. The tomb extends a total distance of 105 metres into the hillside, including extensive side chambers that were neither decorated nor finished. The hasty and incomplete nature of the rock-cutting and decorations (it is only decorated for a little over half its length) within the tomb indicate that the tomb was not completed by the time of Ramesses' death, with the completed hall of pillars serving as the burial chamber.\nAnother notable tomb from this dynasty is KV19, the tomb of Mentuherkhepshef (son of Ramesses IX). This small tomb is simply a converted, unfinished corridor, but the decoration is extensive. The tomb has been newly restored and opened for visitors.\n\nTwenty-first Dynasty and the decline of the necropolis\nBy the end of the New Kingdom, Egypt had entered a long period of political and economic decline. The priests at Thebes grew more powerful, and they effectively administered Upper Egypt, while kings ruling from Tanis controlled Lower Egypt. Some attempt at using the open tombs was made at the start of the Twenty-first Dynasty, with the High Priest of Amun, Pinedjem I, adding his cartouche to KV4. The Valley began to be heavily plundered, so during the Twenty-first Dynasty the priests of Amun opened most of the tombs and moved the mummies into three tombs in order to better protect them. Most of the treasure was removed from the tombs. Most of these were later moved to a single cache near Deir el-Bahari (known as TT320). Located in the cliffs overlooking the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut, this mass reburial contained a large number of royal mummies. They were found in a great state of disorder, many placed in other's coffins, and several are still unidentified. Other mummies were moved to the tomb of Amenhotep II, where over a dozen mummies, many of them royal, were later relocated.\nDuring the later Third Intermediate Period and later periods, intrusive burials were introduced into many of the open tombs. In Coptic times, some of the tombs were used as churches, stables, and even houses.\n\nMinor tombs in the Valley of the Kings\nThe majority of the 65 numbered tombs in the Valley of the Kings can be considered as minor tombs, either because at present they have yielded little information or because the results of their investigations were only poorly recorded by their explorers. Some have received very little attention or were only cursorily noted. Most of these tombs are small, often consisting of only a single burial chamber accessed by a shaft or staircase with a corridor or a series of corridors leading to the chamber.\nNonetheless, some are larger, multiple-chambered tombs. These minor tombs served various purposes: some were intended for burials of lesser royalty or private burials, some contained animal burials, and others apparently never received a primary burial. In many cases these tombs also served secondary functions, and later intrusive material has been found related to these secondary activities. While some of these tombs have been open since antiquity, the majority were discovered in the 19th and early 20th centuries during the height of exploration in the valley.\n\nTomb robbers\nAlmost all tombs throughout Egypt have been robbed. Several papyri have been found that describe the trials of tomb robbers. These date mostly from the late Twentieth Dynasty. One of these, Papyrus Mayer B, describes the robbery of the tomb of Ramesses VI and was probably written during year eight or nine of Ramesses X, around 1118 BC.\n\nThe foreigner Nesamun took us up and showed us the tomb of King Ramesses VI ... And I spent four days breaking into it, we being present all five. We opened the tomb and entered it. ... We found a cauldron of bronze, three wash bowls of bronze ... Confessing to their crimes, the thief goes on to add that a small quarrel arose amongst the robbers when it came to equally dividing the spoils collected from the tomb.\nTombs were filled with valuables, therefore a prime motivation to rob them. Thieves often looted the chambers and bodies of mummies and took with them precious metals and stones, the most common gold and silver, linens and ointments or unguents. Often tombs were robbed when they were still fresh because many of the valuables buried with the mummies were perishable.\nThe valley also seems to have suffered an official plundering during the virtual civil war, which started during the reign of Ramesses XI. The tombs were opened, all the valuables were removed, and the mummies were collected into two large caches. One in the tomb of Amenhotep II, contained sixteen mummies, and others were hidden within Amenhotep I's tomb. A few years later most of them were moved to the Deir el-Bahari cache, containing no fewer than forty royal mummies and their coffins. Only tombs whose locations were lost (KV62, KV63 and KV46, although both KV62 and KV46 were robbed soon after their actual closure) were undisturbed during this period.\nTombs were ransacked for their valuables but also for their original primary purpose. Once robbed, an empty tomb could be used as a burial place for another mummy, which is exactly what happened in the smallest of the pyramids of Giza.\n\nTourism\nMost of the tombs are not open to the public (18 of the tombs can be opened, but they are rarely open at the same time), and officials occasionally close those that are open for restoration work. The number of visitors to KV62 has led to a separate charge for entry into the tomb. The West Valley has only one open tomb – that of Ay – and a separate ticket is needed to visit this tomb. The tour guides are no longer allowed to lecture inside the tombs, and visitors are expected to proceed quietly and in single file through the tombs. This is to minimize time in the tombs and prevent the crowds from damaging the surfaces of the decoration.\nIn 1997, 58 tourists and four Egyptians were massacred at nearby Deir el-Bahari by Islamist militants from Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya. This led to an overall drop in tourism in the area.\nOn most days of the week an average of 4,000 to 5,000 tourists visit the main valley. The West Valley is much less visited, as there is only one tomb that is open to the public.\n\nSee also\nRoyal Wadi and tombs – Burial place of Akhenaten and his royal family.\nNaqsh-e Rostam – Persian \"Valley of the Kings\" royal tombs.\nMing and Qing Imperial Tombs – Royal tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.\nSacred Valley (Peru)\nBurial place of Genghis Khan – An undiscovered place of burial of Genghis Khan and his royal family.\nValley of the Kings (Tibet)\nPetra – Wadi lined with rock-cut buildings, which are mainly tombs.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\n\"Theban Mapping Project\".

          "summary": "The Valley of the Kings, also known as the Valley of the Gates of the Kings, is an area in Egypt where, for a period of nearly 500 years from the Eighteenth Dynasty to the Twentieth Dynasty, rock-cut tombs were excavated for pharaohs and powerful nobles under the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt.\nIt is a wadi sitting on the west bank of the Nile, opposite Thebes (modern-day Luxor) and within the heart of the Theban Necropolis. There are two main sections: the East Valley, where the majority of the royal tombs are situated; and the West Valley, otherwise known as the Valley of the Monkeys.\nWith the 2005 discovery of a new chamber and the 2008 discovery of two further tomb entrances, the Valley of the Kings is known to contain 65 tombs and chambers, ranging in size from the simple pit that is KV54 to the complex tomb that is KV5, which alone has over 120 chambers for the sons of Ramesses II. It was the principal burial place for the New Kingdom's major royal figures as well as a number of privileged nobles. The royal tombs are decorated with traditional scenes from Egyptian mythology and reveal clues to the period's funerary practices and afterlife beliefs. Almost all of the tombs seem to have been opened and robbed in antiquity, but they still give an idea of the opulence and power of Egypt's pharaohs.\nThis area has been a focus for Egyptologists and archaeological exploration since the end of the 18th century, and its tombs and burials continue to stimulate research and interest. The Valley of the Kings garnered significant attention following the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, and is one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world. In 1979, it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site alongside the rest of the Theban Necropolis. Exploration, excavation, and conservation continues in the area and a new tourist centre has recently been opened.",

          "title": "Valley of the Queens",
          "content": "The Valley of the Queens is a site in Egypt, in which queens, princes, princesses, and other high-ranking officials were buried from roughly 1560 BC to 1130 BC. Pharaohs were buried in the Valley of the Kings. The Valley of the Queens was known anciently as Ta-Set-Neferu, which has a double meaning of \"The Place of Beauty\" and/or \"the Place of the Royal Children\". Excavation of the tombs at the Valley of the Queens was pioneered by Ernesto Schiaparelli and Francesco Ballerini in the early 1900s.\nThe Valley of the Queens consists of the main wadi, which contains most of the tombs, along with the Valley of Prince Ahmose, the Valley of the Rope, the Valley of the Three Pits, and the Valley of the Dolmen. The main wadi contains 91 tombs and the subsidiary valleys add another 19 tombs. The burials in the subsidiary valleys all date to the 18th Dynasty.\nThe reason for choosing the Valley of the Queens as a burial site is not known. The close proximity to the workers' village of Deir el-Medina and the Valley of the Kings may have been a factor. Another consideration could have been the existence of a sacred grotto dedicated to Hathor at the entrance of the Valley. This grotto may have been associated with rejuvenation of the dead.\nAlong with the Valley of the Kings and nearby Thebes, the Valley of the Queens was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979.\n\nGeology\nThe Valley of the Queens is on a geological array of limestones, marls, clays, chalks, and shale. The clays in the valley have undergone expansion and shrinkage due to recurrent flash-flooding throughout the valley. This shrinkage has been one cause of unstable tomb construction and later tomb damage in the valley. Rockslides resulting from shrunk clay deposits and tectonic events have damaged not only the tombs of the valley but also the wall paintings within them.\nThe current landscape of the Valley of the Queens was built through faulting and subsequent slumping during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs. Thus, the original horizontal stratigraphy of the area has been subject to tilting. This tilting has revealed deposits of minerals like anhydrite, gypsum, and halite. Salt from halite in the ground is also damaging to the paintings within tombs. Seeping groundwater has permeated the tombs and is the cause of the dissolved and recrystallized salt.\nGypsum, along with clay, is most often believed to be the plasters used in ancient Egypt. Due to the lack of data, however, it is hard to determine what exactly composes the ancient plasters. Such beliefs are contested because of variations of plaster color, hardness, and amount used in a particular tomb.\n\nEighteenth Dynasty\nOne of the first tombs constructed in the Valley of the Queens is the tomb of Princess Ahmose, a daughter of Seqenenre Tao and Queen Sitdjehuti. This tomb likely dates to the reign of Thutmose I. The tombs from this period also include several members of the nobility, including a head of the stables and a vizier.\nThe tombs from the Valley of the Three Pits  mostly date to the Thutmosid period. The tombs are labeled with letters A - L. This valley also contains three shaft tombs, which are the origin of the valley's name. The modern labels for these three tombs are QV 89, QV 90, and QV 91.\nThe Valley of the Dolmen contains an old trail used by the workmen traveling from Deir el-Medina to the Valley of the Queens. Along this path is a small rock-cut temple dedicated to Ptah and Meretseger.\nThe tombs from this time period are generally simple in form and consist of a chamber and a shaft for burial. Some of the tombs were extended in size to accommodate more than one burial. The tombs include those of several royal princes and princesses, as well as some nobles.\nIt has long been thought that that finds located in museums which include fragments of burial equipment for several members of the royal family were from the Valley of the Queens. However, these items which include a canopic jar fragment of the King's Wife Henut, canopic jar fragments mentioning a King's Son, Menkheperre, a King's Great Wife, Nebetnehat, canopic jar fragments with the name of the King's Daughter Ti, all come from the Shaft Tombs of Wadi Bairiya 4.5 kilometres north-west of the Valley of the Queens.\n\nNineteenth Dynasty\nDuring the 19th Dynasty the use of the Valley became more selective. The tombs from this period belong exclusively to royal women. Many of the high-ranking wives of Ramesses I, Seti I and Ramesses II were buried in the Valley. One of the most well-known examples is the resting place carved out of the rock for Queen Nefertari (1290–1224 BCE). The polychrome reliefs in her tomb are still intact. Other members of the royal family continued to be buried in the Valley of the Kings. Tomb KV5, the tomb of the sons of Ramesses II, is an example of this practice.\nThe tomb of Queen Satre (QV 38) was likely the first tomb prepared during this dynasty. It was probably started during the reign of Ramesses I and finished during the reign of Seti I. Several tombs were prepared without an owner in mind, and the names were included upon the death of the royal female.\n\nTwentieth Dynasty\nDuring the beginning of the 20th Dynasty the Valley was still used extensively. Tombs for the wives of Ramesses III were prepared, and in a departure from the conventions of the previous dynasty, several tombs were prepared for royal sons as well. The construction of tombs continued at least until the reign of Ramesses VI. The Turin Papyrus mentions the creation of six tombs during the reign of Ramesses VI. It is not known which tombs are referred to in that papyrus.\nThere is evidence of economic turmoil during the 20th Dynasty. Records show that the workers went on strike during the reign of Ramesses III, and towards the end of the dynasty there are reports of tomb robberies.\n\nThird Intermediate Period and later\nThe Valley was no longer a royal burial site after the close of the 20th Dynasty. Many of the tombs were extensively reused. Several tombs were modified so that they could hold multiple burials. In some cases this involved digging burial pits in the existing tombs. Not much is known about the use of the Valley of the Queens during the Ptolemaic Period but during the Roman Period there was a renewed, extensive use of the Valley as a burial site. During the Coptic Period some Hermit shelters were erected. Tombs QV60 (Nebettawy) and QV73 (Henuttawy) show signs of Coptic occupation. Wall scenes were covered with plaster and decorated with Christian symbols. The Christian presence lasted until the 7th century CE.\n\nThreats to conservation\nConservation efforts in the Valley of the Queens happen in multiple ways. Some large concerns for the site include protection against mass tourism and a concoction of other natural risks.\n\nMass tourism\nWith the rise of the tourism industry, effects humans have on archaeological sites is becoming a topic of interest for preservation teams. Due to their relatively small size and delicate ecosystem, many of the Valley of the Queens tombs are threatened by human interaction. An off balance of humidity and CO2 from humans contributes to the continued degradation of tombs and the art within them. Other factors that lead to tomb deterioration are graffiti, touching, and head bumping due to small spaces.\nLight fixtures installed in some of the tombs for better viewing are also a threat to conservation efforts in the area. Large amounts of lint from visitors' clothes stays in the air and settles on tomb floors and other fixtures, creating an increased fire hazard. As lint settles on the modern light fixtures, the likeliness of combustion increases.\nSteps taken to combat and limit effects on Valley of the Queens tombs from tourism consist of building walled paths that control tourist traffic, constructing shelters at some of the more popular tombs such as QV 66 - Nefertari's tomb. Other methods used to preserve Nefertari's tomb are a viewing time limited to 15 minutes, separate ticket purchase, and the addition of an air-circulation system to the tomb. As for other tombs, plexiglass shields and wooden floors have been installed to protect the entombed and their resting places.\n\nAnimal populations\nCommonly located in open tombs in the Valley of the Queens are small to large bat colonies. Although beneficial for the natural ecosystem, bats are detrimental to the tombs, the wall paintings, and the health of tourists in the valley. Urine and feces from bats damages the rocks, plasters, and paints used for tomb construction and decoration. Also stemming from bat excrement is the increased possibility of visitors getting histoplasmosis. Contact with bat populations also increases the possibility of bat bites and rabies transmission.\nIn an attempt to limit bat occupation of certain tombs, installation of doors and has been proposed. Bat populations must be removed from the tombs before any preventative measures can be taken. Due to ecological importance, some tombs have been selected to remain open to bat colonies. Tombs selected are as follows: QV 15, QV 48, and QV 78.\n\nBurials\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nSims, Lesley (2000). A Visitor's Guide to Ancient Egypt. Saffron Hill, London: Usborne Publishing.

          "title": "Karnak",
          "content": "The Karnak Temple Complex, commonly known as Karnak (), comprises a vast mix of temples, pylons, chapels, and other buildings near Luxor, Egypt. Construction at the complex began during the reign of Senusret I (reigned 1971–1926 BC) in the Middle Kingdom (c. 2000–1700 BC) and continued into the Ptolemaic Kingdom (305–30 BC), although most of the extant buildings date from the New Kingdom. The area around Karnak was the ancient Egyptian Ipet-isut (\"The Most Selected of Places\") and the main place of worship of the 18th Dynastic Theban Triad, with the god Amun as its head. \nIt is part of the monumental city of Thebes, and in 1979 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List along with the rest of the city. Karnak gets its name from the nearby, and partly surrounded, modern village of El-Karnak, 2.5 kilometres (1.6 miles) north of Luxor.\n\nName\nThe original name of the temple was Ipet-isut, meaning \"The Most Select of Places\". The complex's modern name \"Karnak\" comes from the nearby village of el-Karnak, which means \"fortified village\".\n\nOverview\nThe complex is a vast open site and includes the Karnak Open Air Museum. It is believed to be the second-most-visited historical site in Egypt; only the Giza pyramid complex near Cairo receives more visits. It consists of four main parts, of which only the largest is currently open to the public. The term Karnak often is understood as being the Precinct of Amun-Re only, because this is the only part most visitors see. The three other parts, the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Montu, and the dismantled Temple of Amenhotep IV, are closed to the public. There also are a few smaller temples and sanctuaries connecting the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Amun-Re, and the Luxor Temple. The Precinct of Mut is very ancient, being dedicated to an Earth and creation deity, but not yet restored. The original temple was destroyed and partially restored by Hatshepsut, although another pharaoh built around it in order to change the focus or orientation of the sacred area. Many portions of it may have been carried away for use in other buildings.\nThe key difference between Karnak and most of the other temples and sites in Egypt is the length of time over which it was developed and used. Construction of temples started in the Middle Kingdom and continued into Ptolemaic times. Approximately thirty pharaohs contributed to the buildings, enabling it to reach a size, complexity, and diversity not seen elsewhere. Few of the individual features of Karnak are unique, but the size and number of features are vast. The deities represented range from some of the earliest worshipped to those worshipped much later in the history of the Ancient Egyptian culture. Although destroyed, it also contained an early temple built by Amenhotep IV (Akhenaten), the pharaoh who later would celebrate a nearly monotheistic religion he established that prompted him to move his court and religious center away from Thebes. It also contains evidence of adaptations, where the buildings of the ancient Egyptians were used by later cultures for their own religious purposes, such as Coptic churches.\n\nHypostyle Hall\nThe Great Hypostyle Hall in the Precinct of Amun-Re has an area of 5,000 m2 (1.2 acres) with 134 massive columns arranged in 16 rows. One hundred and twenty-two of these columns are 10 metres (33 ft) tall, and the other 12 are 21 metres (69 ft) tall with a diameter of over 3 metres (9.8 ft). The architraves, on top of these columns, are estimated to weigh 70 tons.\nThese architraves may have been lifted to these heights using levers. This would be a time-consuming process and also would require great balance to get to such heights. A common alternative theory regarding how they were moved is that large ramps were constructed of sand, mud, brick or stone and that the stones were then towed up the ramps. If stone had been used for the ramps, they would have been able to use much less material. The top of the ramps presumably would have employed either wooden tracks or cobblestones for towing the megaliths.\nThere is an unfinished pillar in an out-of-the-way location that indicates how it would have been finished. Final carving was executed after the drums were put in place so that it was not damaged while being placed. Several experiments moving megaliths with ancient technology were made at other locations – some of which are amongst the largest monoliths in the world.\nThe sun god's shrine was built so that it has light focused upon it during the winter solstice.\nIn 2009, UCLA launched a website dedicated to virtual reality digital reconstructions of the Karnak complex and other resources.\n\nHistory\nThe history of the Karnak complex is largely the history of Thebes and its changing role in the culture. Religious centers varied by region, and when a new capital of the unified culture was established, the religious centers in that area gained prominence. The city of Thebes does not appear to have been of great significance before the Eleventh Dynasty and previous temple building there would have been relatively small, with shrines being dedicated to the early deities of Thebes, the Earth goddess Mut and Montu. Early building was destroyed by invaders. The earliest known artifact found in the area of the temple is a small, eight-sided column from the Eleventh Dynasty, which mentions Amun-Re. Amun (sometimes called Amen) was long the local tutelary deity of Thebes. He was identified with the ram and the goose. The Egyptian meaning of Amun is \"hidden\" or the \"hidden god\".\n\nMajor construction work in the Precinct of Amun-Re took place during the Eighteenth Dynasty, when Thebes became the capital of the unified Ancient Egypt. Almost every pharaoh of that dynasty added something to the temple site. Thutmose I erected an enclosure wall connecting the Fourth and Fifth pylons, which comprise the earliest part of the temple still standing in situ. Hatshepsut had monuments constructed and also restored the original Precinct of Mut, that had been ravaged by the foreign rulers during the Hyksos occupation. She had twin obelisks, at the time the tallest in the world, erected at the entrance to the temple. One still stands, as the second-tallest ancient obelisk still standing on Earth; the other has toppled and is broken.\nAnother of her projects at the site, Karnak's Red Chapel or Chapelle Rouge, was intended as a barque shrine and originally may have stood between her two obelisks. She later ordered the construction of two more obelisks to celebrate her sixteenth year as pharaoh; one of the obelisks broke during construction, and thus, a third was constructed to replace it. The broken obelisk was left at its quarrying site in Aswan, where it still remains. Known as the unfinished obelisk, it provides evidence of how obelisks were quarried.\n\nConstruction of the Great Hypostyle Hall also may have begun during the Eighteenth Dynasty (although most new building was undertaken under Seti I and Ramesses II in the Nineteenth). Merneptah, also of the Nineteenth Dynasty, commemorated his victories over the Sea Peoples on the walls of the Cachette Court, the start of the processional route (also known as the Avenue of Sphinxes) to the Luxor Temple. The last major change to the Precinct of Amun-Re's layout was the addition of the First Pylon and the massive enclosure walls that surround the precinct, both constructed by Nectanebo I of the Thirtieth Dynasty.\nAncient Greek and Roman writers wrote about a range of monuments in Upper Egypt and Nubia, including Karnak, Luxor temple, the Colossi of Memnon, Esna, Edfu, Kom Ombo, Philae, and others.\nIn 323 AD, Roman emperor Constantine the Great recognized the Christian religion, and in 356 Constantius II ordered the closing of pagan temples throughout the Roman empire, into which Egypt had been annexed in 30 BC. Karnak was by this time mostly abandoned, and Christian churches were founded among the ruins, the most famous example of this is the reuse of the Festival Hall of Thutmose III's central hall, where painted decorations of saints and Coptic inscriptions can still be seen.\n\nEuropean knowledge of Karnak\nThebes' exact placement was unknown in medieval Europe, though both Herodotus and Strabo give the exact location of Thebes and how long up the Nile one must travel to reach it. Maps of Egypt, based on the 2nd century Claudius Ptolemaeus' mammoth work Geographia, had been circulating in Europe since the late 14th century, all of them showing Thebes' (Diospolis) location. Despite this, several European authors of the 15th and 16th centuries who visited only Lower Egypt and published their travel accounts, such as Joos van Ghistele and André Thévet, put Thebes in or close to Memphis.\n\nThe first European description of the Karnak temple complex was by an unknown Venetian in 1589 and is housed in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze, although his account gives no name for the complex.\nKarnak (\"Carnac\") as a village name, and name of the complex, is first attested in 1668, when two capuchin missionary brothers, Protais and Charles François d'Orléans, travelled though the area. Protais' writing about their travel was published by Melchisédech Thévenot (Relations de divers voyages curieux, 1670s–1696 editions) and Johann Michael Vansleb (The Present State of Egypt, 1678).\n\nThe first drawing of Karnak is found in Paul Lucas' travel account of 1704, (Voyage du Sieur Paul Lucas au Levant). It is rather inaccurate, and can be quite confusing to modern eyes. Lucas travelled in Egypt during 1699–1703. The drawing shows a mixture of the Precinct of Amun-Re and the Precinct of Montu, based on a complex confined by the three huge Ptolemaic gateways of Ptolemy III Euergetes / Ptolemy IV Philopator, and the massive 113 m long, 43 m high and 15 m thick, First Pylon of the Precinct of Amun-Re.\nKarnak was visited and described in succession by Claude Sicard and his travel companion Pierre Laurent Pincia (1718 and 1720–21), Granger (1731), Frederick Louis Norden (1737–38), Richard Pococke (1738), James Bruce (1769), Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt (1777), William George Browne (1792–93), and finally by a number of scientists of the Napoleon expedition, including Vivant Denon, during 1798–1799. Claude-Étienne Savary describes the complex in rather great detail in his work of 1785; especially in light of the fact that it is a fictional account of a pretend journey to Upper Egypt, composed out of information from other travellers. Savary did visit Lower Egypt in 1777–78, and published a work about that too.\n\nMain parts\nPrecinct of Amun-Re\nThis is the largest of the precincts of the temple complex, and is dedicated to Amun-Re, the chief deity of the Theban Triad. There are several colossal statues, including the figure of Pinedjem I which is 10.5 metres (34 ft) tall. The sandstone for this temple, including all of the columns, was transported from Gebel Silsila 100 miles (161 km) south on the Nile river. It also has one of the largest obelisks, weighing 328 tons and standing 29 metres (95 ft) tall.\n\nPrecinct of Mut\nLocated to the south of the newer Amun-Re complex, this precinct was dedicated to the mother goddess, Mut, who became identified as the wife of Amun-Re in the Eighteenth Dynasty Theban Triad. It has several smaller temples associated with it and has its own sacred lake, constructed in a crescent shape. This temple has been ravaged, many portions having been used in other structures. Following excavation and restoration works by the Johns Hopkins University team, led by Betsy Bryan (see below) the Precinct of Mut has been opened to the public. Six hundred black granite statues were found in the courtyard to her temple. It may be the oldest portion of the site.\nIn 2006, Bryan presented her findings of a festival that included apparent intentional overindulgence in alcohol. Participation in the festival included the priestesses and the population. Historical records of tens of thousands attending the festival exist. These findings were made in the temple of Mut because when Thebes rose to greater prominence, Mut absorbed the warrior goddesses, Sekhmet and Bast, as some of her aspects. First, Mut became Mut-Wadjet-Bast, then Mut-Sekhmet-Bast (Wadjet having merged into Bast), then Mut also assimilated Menhit, another lioness goddess, and her adopted son's wife, becoming Mut-Sekhmet-Bast-Menhit, and finally becoming Mut-Nekhbet.\nTemple excavations at Luxor discovered a \"porch of drunkenness\" built onto the temple by the pharaoh Hatshepsut, during the height of her twenty-year reign. In a later myth developed around the annual drunken Sekhmet festival, Ra, by then the sun god of Upper Egypt, created her from a fiery eye gained from his mother, to destroy mortals who conspired against him (Lower Egypt). In the myth, Sekhmet's blood-lust was not quelled at the end of the battle and led to her destroying almost all of humanity, so Ra had tricked her by turning the Nile as red as blood (the Nile turns red every year when filled with silt during inundation) so that Sekhmet would drink it. The trick, however, was that the red liquid was not blood, but beer mixed with pomegranate juice so that it resembled blood, making her so drunk that she gave up slaughter and became an aspect of the gentle Hathor. The complex interweaving of deities occurred over the thousands of years of the culture.\n\nPrecinct of Montu\nThis portion of the site is dedicated to the son of Mut and Amun-Re, Montu, a war-god. It is located to the north of the Amun-Re complex and is much smaller in size. It is not open to the public.\n\nTemple of Amenhotep IV (deliberately dismantled)\nThe temple that Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV) constructed on the site was located east of the main complex, outside the walls of the Amun-Re precinct. It was destroyed immediately after the death of its builder, who had attempted to overcome the powerful priesthood who had gained control over Egypt before his reign. It was so thoroughly demolished that its full extent and layout is unknown. The priesthood of that temple regained their powerful position as soon as Akhenaten died, and were instrumental in destroying many records of his existence.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of megalithic sites\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nBlyth, Elizabeth (2006).

          "summary": "The Karnak Temple Complex, commonly known as Karnak (), comprises a vast mix of temples, pylons, chapels, and other buildings near Luxor, Egypt. Construction at the complex began during the reign of Senusret I (reigned 1971–1926 BC) in the Middle Kingdom (c. 2000–1700 BC) and continued into the Ptolemaic Kingdom (305–30 BC), although most of the extant buildings date from the New Kingdom. The area around Karnak was the ancient Egyptian Ipet-isut (\"The Most Selected of Places\") and the main place of worship of the 18th Dynastic Theban Triad, with the god Amun as its head. \nIt is part of the monumental city of Thebes, and in 1979 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List along with the rest of the city. Karnak gets its name from the nearby, and partly surrounded, modern village of El-Karnak, 2.5 kilometres (1.6 miles) north of Luxor.",

          "content": "The Luxor Temple (Arabic: معبد الأقصر) is a large Ancient Egyptian temple complex located on the east bank of the Nile River in the city today known as Luxor (ancient Thebes) and was constructed approximately 1400 BCE. In the Egyptian language it was known as ipet resyt, \"the southern sanctuary\". It was one of the two primary temples on the east bank, the other being Karnak. Unlike the other temples in Thebes, Luxor temple is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified version of the pharaoh in death.  Instead, Luxor temple is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; it may have been where many of the pharaohs of Egypt were crowned in reality or conceptually (as in the case of Alexander the Great, who claimed he was crowned at Luxor but may never have traveled south of Memphis, near modern Cairo).\nTo the rear of the temple are chapels built by Amenhotep III of the 18th Dynasty, and Alexander. Other parts of the temple were built by Tutankhamun and Ramesses II. During the Roman era, the temple and its surroundings were a legionary fortress and the home of the Roman government in the area. During the Roman period a chapel inside the Luxor Temple originally dedicated to the goddess Mut was transformed into a Tetrarchy cult chapel and later into a church.\nAlong with the other archeological sites in Thebes, the Luxor Temple was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979.\n\nConstruction\nThe Luxor Temple was built with sandstone from the Gebel el-Silsila area, which is  located in South-Western Egypt. This sandstone is referred to as Nubian sandstone. It was used for the construction of monuments in Upper Egypt as well as in the course of past and current restoration works.\nLike other Egyptian structures, a common technique used was symbolism, or illusionism. For example, to the Egyptian, a sanctuary shaped like an Anubis jackal was really Anubis. At the Luxor Temple, the two obelisks (the smaller one closer to the west is now at the Place de la Concorde in Paris) flanking the entrance were not the same height, but they created the illusion that they were. With the layout of the temple they appear to be of equal height, but using illusionism, it enhances the relative distances hence making them look the same size to the wall behind it. Symbolically, it is a visual and spatial effect to emphasize the heights and distance from the wall, enhancing the already existing pathway.\n\nExcavation\nFrom the Middle Ages, the population of Luxor had settled in and around the temple, at the southward end of the mount. Due to this, centuries of rubble had accumulated, to the point where there was an artificial hill some 14.5 to 15 metres (48 to 49 ft) in height. The Luxor Temple had begun to be excavated by Professor Gaston Maspero after 1884, once he had been given permission to commence operations. The excavations were sporadic until 1960. Over time, accumulated rubbish of the ages had buried three quarters of the temple which contained the courts and colonnades which formed the nucleus of the Arab half of the modern village. Maspero had taken an interest earlier, and he had obtained the post of Mariette Pasha to complete the job in 1881. Not only was there rubbish, but there were also barracks, stores, houses, huts, pigeon towers, which needed to be removed in order to excavate the site. (There still exists a working mosque within the temple which was never removed.) Maspero received from the Egyptian minister of public works the authorization needed to obtain funds in order to negotiate compensation for the pieces of land covered by the houses and dependencies.\n\nFestivals\nThe Luxor Temple was built during the New Kingdom and dedicated to the Theban Triad consisted of Amun, his consort Mut, and their son Khonsu. The focus of the annual Opet Festival, in which a cult statue of Amun was paraded down the Nile from nearby Karnak Temple (ipet-sut) to stay there for a while with his consort Mut, was to promote the fertility of Amun-Re and the Pharaoh. However, other studies at the temple by the Epigraphic Survey team present a completely new interpretation of Luxor and its great annual festival (the Feast of Opet). They have concluded that Luxor is the temple dedicated to the divine Egyptian ruler or, more precisely, to the cult of the Royal Ka. Examples of the cult of the Royal Ka can be seen with the colossal seated figures of the deified Ramesses II before the Pylon and at the entrance to the Grand colonnade are clearly Ka-statues, cult statues of the king as embodiment of the royal Ka.\n\nAvenue of Sphinxes and Shrine stations\nThe avenue (known as wi.t ntr \"path of god\"; طريق الكباش) which went in a straight line for about 2.7 kilometres (1.7 mi) between the Luxor Temple and the Karnak area was lined with human-headed sphinxes; in ancient times it is probable that these replaced earlier sphinxes which may have had different heads. Six barque shrines, serving as way stations for the barques of the gods during festival processions, were set up on the avenue between the Karnak and Luxor Temple. Along the avenue the stations were set up for ceremonies such as the Feast of Opet which held significance to the temple. Each station had a purpose, for example the fourth station was the station of Kamare, which cooled the oar of Amun. The Fifth station of Kamare was the station which received the beauty of Amun. Lastly the Sixth Station of Kamare was a shrine for Amun, Holy of Steps. \nA small mudbrick shrine was built in the courtyard of Nectanebo I in early second century (126 CE) and was dedicated to Serapis and Isis; it was presented to Roman Emperor Hadrian on his birthday.\n\nAbu Haggag Mosque\nThe active Abu Haggag Mosque (مسجد أبو الحجاج بالأقصر) is located within the temple, standing on the ancient columns themselves. That part of the Luxor Temple was converted to a church by the Romans in 395 AD, and then to a mosque around 640 AD, which is more than 3,400 years of continuous religious worship.\n\nDefacement\nIn 2013, a Chinese student posted a picture of engraved writing that read \"Ding Jinhao was here\" (Chinese: 丁锦昊到此一游) in Chinese on a sculpture. This discovery spurred debate about increased tourism after the media confirmed a Chinese student caused this and other defacements. The graffiti has since been partially cleared.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nTemple of Khonsu\nLuxor Museum\n\nReferences",

          "content": "معبد الاقصر معبد كبير من المعابد المصريه القديمه المعقده يقع على الضفه الشرقيه لنهر النيل في مدينه الاقصر اليوم المعروفه باسم (طيبه القديمه). تاسس سنه 1400 قبل الميلاد. شُيد معبد الاقصر لعباده امون رع وزوجته موت وابنهما خونسو؛ وهي الارباب التي يطلق عليها ايضا لقب الثالوث الطيبي (ثالوث طيبه). تم تشييد معبد الاقصر في عهد ملوك الاسره الثامنه عشر، والاسره التاسعه عشره. واهم الابنيه القائمه بالمعبد هي تلك التي شيدها الملكان امنحوتب الثالث (1397-1360 ق.م.) ورمسيس الثاني (1290-1223 ق.م.) (الذي اضاف الى المعبد الفناء المفتوح والصرح والمسلتين). كما اقام الملك تحتمس الثالث (1490-1436 ق.م.) مقاصير لزوار ثالوث طيبه المقدس، كما قام توت عنخ امون (1348-1337 ق.م.) باستكمال نقوش جدرانه. وقد دُمُرت المقصوره الثلاثيه التي كانت قد شُيّدت من قبل في عهد الملكه حتشبسوت والملك تحتمس الثالث (من الاسره الثامنه عشره)؛ ثم اُعيد بناؤها في عهد الملك رمسيس الثاني. سمي المعبد ايضاً «ايبت رسيت» (وتعني الحرم الجنوبي او المكان الخاص بامون رع). وهو من احسن المعابد المصريه حفظاً واجملها بناء، وفيه يتجلى تخطيط المعبد المصري اوضح ما يكون.\n\nتاريخ بناء المعبد\nعصر الدوله الوسطى: من المحتمل انه كان يوجد في نفس المنطقه التي اقام فيها امنحتب الثالث المعبد بقايا معبد قديم او مقصوره مقدسه ترجع الى عصر الدوله الوسطى واغلب الظن انه كان في عصر الاسره الثانيه عشره.\nالملك امنحتب الثالث: يرجع الفضل في بناء المعبد في صورته الحاليه على الضفه الشرقيه للنيل على محور واحد من الشمال الى الجنوب الى امنحتب الثالث من ملوك الاسره الثامنه عشره.\nالملكه حتشبسوت والملك تحتمس الثالث: قاما بتشيد مبنى صغير مكون من ثلاث مقاصير خصصت لثالوث طيبه ومن المحتمل ان الملك رمسيس الثاني قد اعاد بناء هذه المقاصير وسجّل اسمه عليها.\nالملك رمسيس الثاني: اضاف الملك رمسيس الثاني من ملوك الاسره التاسعه عشره صرحا كبيراً وخلفه فناء فسيحا ذا اساطين برديه.\n\nمحور المعبد\nيمكننا ان نلاحظ ان المعماريين القدماء انشاوا المعابد على الجانب الشرقي للنيل في اتجاه محور غربي شرقي، بينما شيٌدوها على الجانب الغربي في اتجاه محور شرقي غربي، ومع ذلك فان معبد الاقصر (الكائن في البر الشرقي) شُيّد في اتجاه محور شمالي جنوبي، ربما لكي يكون على خط واحد مع مجموعه معبد الكرنك الذي يقع الى الشمال منه، ومع طريق ابي الهول او الكباش الذي كان يربط بين المعبدين. وربما اضطر معماريو الملك رمسيس الثاني ـ في وقت لاحق ـ الى تغيير محاور الابنيه التي اضيفت في عهده، وكذلك الصرح والبهو لمعبد الملك امنحوتب الثالث، عندما اعادوا تشييد المقصوره الثلاثيه الاقدم للملكه حتشبسوت والملك تحتمس الثالث.\n\nاسباب تاسيس المعبد\nامر امنحتب الثالث باقامه هذا المعبد لثالوث طيبه اغلب الظن لامرين: الاول كان لتاكيد نسبه للاله امون نفسه، اذ ان احقيته للعرش لم تكن واضحه طبقا للتقاليد المصريه التي تنص بان الفرعون يجب ان يكون ابن فرعون واميره من سلاله نقيه اما اذا كانت سلالته غير نقيه فيكتسب احقيته للعرش بالزواج من الابنه الكبرى للملك (السابق). ولم ينطبق احد الشرطين على امنحتب الثالث فامه لم تكن مصريه وزوجته لم تكن من سلاله ملكيه. ولهذا اكّد شرعيته للعرش باثبات نسبه للاله امون نفسه وتسجيل ولادته المقدسه على جدران الغرفه الشهيره بالمعبد والمعروفه بغرفه الولاده. والثاني هو ارضاء لكهنه امون لكي يتقبلوه فرعوناً شرعيا لمصر ولذلك خصص هذا المعبد للاله امون ولصوره من صوره وهي التي يطلق عليها «امون رع-كا-موت-اف» اي «امون –رع ثور امه» وهي الصوره التي تظهر امون-رع كاله للخصب ولدوره الحياه.\n\nمدخل المعبد\nمدخل معبد الاقصر هو البرج الاول بارتفاع 24 متر (79 قدم)، بناه رمسيس الثاني وزُين البرج بمشاهد انتصارات رمسيس العسكريه (لا سيما معركه قادش)؛ كما سجّلت انتصارات الفراعنه في وقت لاحق، لا سيما انتصارات الاسره 25 (السلاله النوبيه).\n\nتسميه المعبد\nابت رست: اطلق المصريون على هذا المعبد اسم «ابت رست» والتي قد تعني الحريم الجنوبي (حيث تسكن موت زوجه امون) او المقصوره الجنوبيه..\n\nمهندس البناء\nامنحتب بن حابو .\n\nوصف المعبد\nطريق ابو الهول\nوهو عباره عن طريق مرصوف ببلاطات من الحجر يحف به من الجانبين تماثيل على هيئه ابو الهول تمثل الملك نقتنبو الاول (من ملوك الاسره الثلاثين) الذي انشا هذا الطريق في عهده. وكان هذا الطريق يوصل الى معبد الاله خنسو الواقع جنوب معابد الكرنك وقد حلّ هذا الطريق محل طريق الكباش الذي يرجع الى عهد الملك امنحتب الثالث، بدليل وجود بعض التماثيل التي تحمل اسم امنحتب الثالث عند البوابه الجنوبيه لمعبد خنسو. وقد نحت تمثال ابو الهول من كتله واحده من الحجر الرملي تجسّد اسد له راس الملك نقتنبو، وقد وضع التمثال على قاعده مستطيله ابعادها 120X330 سم وقد تم الكشف حتى الان عن 34 تمثالاً لابو الهول على كل جانب. والهدف من طريق ابو الهول هو تحديد مسار الموكب سواء الملكي ام الالهي وابراز محوره.\n\nمسلات المعبد\nكان يتقدم صرح الملك رمسيس الثاني مسلتين من حجر الجرانيت الوردي تزين الغربيه منهما الان ميدان الكونكورد في باريس منذ عام 1836 وارتفاعها 22,84 مترا وتزن 220 طنا، اما المسله الشرقيه وهي القائمه الان امام البرج الشمالي فيبلغ ارتفاعها 22,52 مترا وارتفاع قاعدتها 2,51 مترا ويبلغ وزنها 257 طنا وتتميز بمجموعه القرده البارزه (اربعه قرود) التي تهلل للشمس عند شروقها والمنحوته على قاعدتها وقد سجّل على هاتين المسلتين بالنقوش الهيروغليفيه اسم الملك رمسيس الثاني والقابه، كما مثل على قمتها وهو يقدم القربان الى الاله امون.\nولعل السبب من وجود المسله امام صرح المعبد ربما -بجانب كونها رمز من رموز الشمس- لتعلن من بعيد عن مكان المعبد، وخاصه ان هذه المسلات ذات قمام مدببه وكانت مغطاه -اغلب الظن- بطبقه نحاسيه مذهبه حتى تظل براقه ساطعه.\n\nشُيّد مسجد ابي الحجاج الاقصري ـ الذي يرجع الى العصر الايوبي ـ على الجانب الشمالي الشرقي من معبد الاقصر .\n\nصرح الملك رمسيس الثانى\nقام بتشيده الملك رمسيس الثاني، وهو عباره عن بوابه ضخمه يتوسطها مدخل المعبد، ويبلغ عرض هذا الصرح 65 م، وارتفاعه 24 م.\n\nالجناح الايمن (الغربى)\nتصف النقوش الغائره على واجه الصرح المعارك الحربيه التي قام بها الملك رمسيس الثاني ضد الحيثيين في العام الخامس من حكمه. فنشاهد على الجناح الايمن (الغربي)للصرح الملك رمسيس الثاني ومعه مسشاروه العسكريون (المنظر منقوش في اقصى الشمال)، وفي الوسط نرى الموقع او المعسكر الذي هزم فيه اعداءه من الحيثيين، وفي اقصى اليمين نشاهد الملك في عربته الحربيه وسط المعركه.\n\nالجناح الايسر (الشرقى)\nنشاهد على هذا الجناح الملك رمسيس الثاني في عربته الحربيه، يرمى الاعداء الحيثيين بوابل من السهام، والارض مغطاه بالقتلى والجرحى، اما الاحياء فيهربون مزعورين ويتركون قادش.وفي اقصى الشمال على هذا الجناح منظر الامير قادش يصوره خائفا في عربته. وهناك وصف كامل لهذه المعركه كتب باللغه المصريه القديمه (بالنقش الهيروغليفى)باسلوب شعرى موجود ايضا على الجزء الاسفل من هذا الصرح، والنص يبدا من الجناح الغربي (الايمن)وينتهى على الجناح الشرقي. يوجد على واجهه الصرح ايضا اربع فجوات عموديه، فجوتان في كل جناح وقد خصصت لكى توضع فيها ساريات الاعلام، كما يوجد ايضا في اعلى الصرح اربع فتحات خصصت لكى تثبت فيها هذه الساريات.\nكان يتقدم الصرح وظهورها الى جداره سته تماثيل ضخمه للملك رمسيس الثاني اربعه واقفه –اثنان على كل جانب –لم يبق منهما الا تمثال واحد فقط هو المقام الى اقصى اليمين بالنسبه للداخل.وهناك، تمثالان كبيران على جانبى المدخل يمثلان الملك رمسيس الثاني وهو جالس على عرشه، ونقش على جانبى العرش منظرا يمثل اتحاد القطرين وعلى جانب كرسى العرش تمثال صغير للملكه نفرتارى على الجانب الايسر للتمثال الشرقي وتمثال الاميره على الجانب الايمن للتمثال الغربي.وحول قاعدتى التمثالين نقشت صور الاسرى واسمائهم على صدورهم.ارتفاع كل تمثال 14م.\nنشاهد على جانبى المدخل من الخارج مناظر تمثل الملك رمسيس الثاني في علاقاته المختلفه مع الالهه والالهات.نذكر منها ثالوث طيبه المقدس، بالاضافه الى الالهه امونت.اما على كتفى المدخل من الداخل فهناك اضافات ترجع الى عصر الاسره الخامسه والعشرين تمثل الملك شاباكا في علاقاته المختلفه مع كل من امون وامونت ومنتو وحتحور. اما خلف الجناح الايسر للصرح الشرقي فهناك مناظر جميله مختلفه ومتعدده للملك رمسيس الثاني وزوجته في حضره الالهه والالهات..ثم وهما يشاركان في الاحتفال بعيد الاله مين.\n\nالفناء الاول\nاقامه رمسيس الثاني ويبلغ طوله 57 م وعرضه 51 م ولا يقع محور هذا الفناء على امتداد محور المعبد وانما ينحرف نحو الشرق ربما لكى يتجه نحو معبد الكرنك او ليتفادى المقاصير التي شيدتها من قبل حتشبسوت وتحتمس الثالث في المكان الحالى ويحيط بفناء رمسيس الثاني الصفات التي يرتكز سقف كل منها على صفين من الاساطين، عدا المبنى الذي شيدته حتشبسوت وتحتمس الثالث والذي يقع على يمين الداخل مباشره، وقد شكلت هذه الاساطين (74 اسطونا) على هيئه نبات البردى وتنتهى بتيجان على شكل براعم البردى.وتقوم بين الاساطين الاماميه في النصف الجنوبي لهذا الفناء المفتوح تماثيل للملك رمسيس الثاني منها ما يمثله واقفا (11 تمثالا) ومنها ما يمثله جالسا (تمثالان) فنرى على جانبى المدخل الموصل الى الممرالعظيم الذي اقامه امنحتب الثالث تمثالين ضخمين يمثلان رمسيس الثاني جالسا على العرش الذين زين بمناظر تمثل الهي النيل وهما يؤكدان الوحده بين الوجهين وذلك بربط نبات البردى رمز الشمال ونبات اللوتس رمز الجنوب.وقد اطلق على هذا الفناء اسم «معبد رعمسو المتحد مع الابديه».\nتزين جدران الفناء الفسيح مناظر مختلفه تمثل التقدمات المقدسه بجانب مناظر تمثل الشعوب الاجنبيه المهزومه ومن اهم المناظر التي يجب مشاهدتها في الفناء المنظر الموجود على الجدار الجنوبي الغربي، والمنظر هنا يمثل واجهه معبد الاقصر كامله اي الصرح بتماثيله السته واعلامه والمسلتين، وعلى يمين (الناظر)نرى موكبا يتقدمه الامراء من ابناء رمسيس الثاني تتبعهم الاضاحى السمينه المزينه من الماشيه التي سوف يضحى بها _اغلب الظن_كقربان للالهه (تكمله المنظر نراه على الجدار الغربي).\n\nمقاصير تحتمس الثالث\nموجوده في الركن الشمالي الغربي من فناء رمسيس الثاني وقد قام بتشيدها كل من حتشبسوت وتحتمس الثالث وان كان البعض يرى ان رمسيس الثاني الذي سجِل اسمه عليها هو الذي اقامها بحجاره اغتصبها من مقاصير لحتشبسوت وتحتمس الثالث. يتقدم هذه المقاصير اربعه اساطين رشيقه على شكل حزمه سيقان البردي من الجرانيت الاحمر اما تيجانها فهي تمثل سيقان البردي. وقد خصصت المقصوره الوسطى للزورق المقدس للاله امون رع، والغربيه للزورق المقدس لزوجته الالهه موت، والشرقيه للزورق المقدس للابن الاله خنسو اله القمر. وتميزت كل مقصوره من المقاصير الثلاث بمناظر تمثل اطلاق البخور والتطهير وتقدمه الدهون والقربان الى المركب المقدس الخاص بالاله (او الالهه) صاحب المقصوره هذا بالاضافه الى المناظر الدينيه المختلفه. اما جامع ابي الحجاج فيشغل الجزء الشمالي الشرقي من الفناء.\n\nفناء الاربعه عشر اسطونا\nكان يمثل مدخل المعبد في عهد امنحتب الثالث\nالصرح يبلغ عرضه 65 وارتفاعه 24 م يتوسطه بوابه ضخمه محلاه بفجوات خصصت لتثبيت ساريات الاعلام ويتقدم الصرح سته لرمسيس الثاني اثنين منها تمثله جالسا من الجرانيت الاسود واربعه تمثله واقفامن الجرانيت الوردى وتقف امام المعبد مسلتين لم تبق غير المسله الشرقيه وتزين قاعدتها مجموعه من القرود المهلله لاله الشمس اما المسله الغربيه فقد نقلت الى باريس وهي مقامه حاليا في

          "content": "Deir el-Bahari or Dayr al-Bahri (Arabic: الدير البحري, romanized: al-Dayr al-Baḥrī, lit. 'the Northern [lit., \"Seaward\"] Monastery', Coptic: ⲡⲧⲟⲡⲟⲥ ⲛⲁⲡⲁ ⲫⲟⲓⲃⲁⲙⲙⲱⲛ, lit. 'the monastery of Apa Phoibammon', Ancient Egyptian: djeser-djeseru) is a complex of mortuary temples and tombs located on the west bank of the Nile, opposite the city of Luxor, Egypt. This is a part of the Theban Necropolis.\n\nHistory\nDeir el-Bahari, located on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes (modern Luxor) is a complex of mortuary temples and tombs that has served as a major religious center for over two millennia. Its history begins with the 11th Dynasty when Pharaoh Mentuhotep II (c.2061-2010 BCE) constructed his funerary temple here to commemorate the reunification of Egypt after the First Intermediate Period. Mentuhotep's terraced complex, integrating a royal tomb into a temple platform, pioneered the cliffside temple style later emulated by New Kingdom rulers. Centuries later, the 18th Dynasty queen Hatshepsut erected her famous temple Djeser-Djeseru, designed by her architect Senenmut, directly beside Mentuhotep's complex. Richly decorated reliefs in Hatshepsut's temple celebrated her divine birth, commercial expedition to Punt, and association with Amun-Ra, cementing the temple's significance in state religion and royal propaganda. Later, Thutmose III added a smaller temple, Djeser-Akhet, just above hers. By the Third Intermediate Period, Deir el-Bahari became a burial ground for priests and a hiding place for royal mummies such as those discovered in the DB320 cache in 1881.\n\nArchaeological exploration in Deir el-Bahari began ramping up in the late 19th century. Édouard Naville's excavations from 1893 to 1906, sponsored by the Egypt Exploration Fund, revealed both Hatshepsut's temple and Mentuhotep II's complex. This was followed by Herbert Winlock's Metropolitan Museum of Art expeditions (1911-1931), which unearthed significant finds, including statues of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III and caches of ritual objects. The Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology began extensive restoration work in the 1960s, stabilizing Hatshepsut's temple and recovering Thutmose III's largely destroyed shrine. Meanwhile, the sites significance as a necropolis continued into the Ptolemaic Period, when parts off Hatshepsut's temple were reused for cults of Imhotep and Amenhotep, Son of Hapu. Deir el-Bahari's rich history reflects its role as a sacred landscape where kings and priests were memorialized, divine legitimacy was protected, and Theban religious traditions flourished across changing dynasties.\n\nAssociated deities\nThe purpose and significance of the structures and burials at Deir el-Bahari is closely related with the deities associated with Deir el-Bahari and the greater Theban Necropolis.\nHathor was a prominent goddess at Deir el-Bahari, venerated as a divine mother, protector, and patroness of the necropolis. The cliffs at Deir el-Bahari were sacred to Hathor before pharaonic construction, with Mentuhotep II likely honoring her cult when building there. His temple complex included shrines for royal women, priestesses of Hathor, underscoring the goddess’s significance. Hathor, regarded as “Lady of the West,” was often depicted as a cow emerging from the cliffs to welcome and nourish souls. Hatshepsut’s temple featured a chapel of Hathor with Hathor-headed columns and reliefs of offerings, highlighting Hathor’s enduring role in funerary rites and royal worship from the Middle to New Kingdom.\nAnubis, the jackal-headed god of mummification, was revered as a guardian of tombs and guide of souls. Known as “He Who is Upon His Mountain” and “Foremost of the Westerners,” Though later eclipsed by Osiris in theology, Anubis remained essential as the patron of embalmers, and continued to be invoked as the guardian of tomb doors and the guide who conducts the \"weighing of the heart\" judgement for souls. At Deir el-Bahari, Hatshepsut’s temple featured a dedicated Anubis chapel on the north side of the middle terrace. Well-preserved reliefs show Anubis receiving offerings, reflecting his role in embalming rites and transition to the afterlife, with archaeological evidence confirming his importance across the Theban Necropolis.\nOsiris, god of death and resurrection, became increasingly central to Theban funerary religion. Osiris is depicted as a mummified king wearing the Atef-crown and his mythology as the murdered and resurrected ruler made him the divine guarantor of rebirth for the deceased. The worship of Osiris at Deir el-Bahari can be traced to the Middle Kingdom when King Mentuhotep II incorporated Osirian symbolism into his mortuary cult. Osiris' cult was fully integrated into royal mortuary temples at Hatshepsut's Djeser-Djeseru, over twenty-five life size Osiride statues of the queen in Osiris form stood against the pillars of the upper terrace.\n\nMeretseger, a cobra goddess local to the Theban Necropolis, personified the sacred peak overlooking the royal tombs and was called “She Who Loves Silence.” She guarded the necropolis, especially the Valley of the Kings, envisioned as a cobra atop the mountain watching for tomb robbers. Her cult is evidenced by votive stelae and artisans' graffiti, portraying her as both a punisher of wrongdoers and a merciful healer who forgave the penitent.\nAmun (\"The Hidden One\") was the supreme god of Thebes, originally a local air deity who rose to national prominence as \"Amun-Ra\". He is typically depicted as a man with a double plumed crown, sometimes fused with the sun god Ra, reflecting his role as a creator and solar deity. Amun's worship at Deir el-Bahari began in the Middle Kingdom: the mortuary complex of Mentuhotep II was likely among the first west Theban temples designed to receive the barque of Amun during festivals. In the New Kingdom, Hatshepsut built the central sanctuary of her terraced temple for Amun-Ra, placing his cult chapel at the heart of Djeser-Djeseru. Inscriptions and reliefs from the site honor Amun's oracles and his role in legitimizing Hatshepsut's kingship, underscoring Amun's status as king of the gods and patron of pharaohs at the Theban Necropolis.\n\nMortuary temple of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep\nMentuhotep II, the Eleventh Dynasty king who reunited Egypt at the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, built a very unusual funerary complex. His mortuary temple was built on several levels in the great bay at Deir el-Bahari. It was approached by a 16-meter-wide (52-foot) causeway leading from a valley temple which no longer exists.\nThe mortuary temple itself consists of a forecourt and entrance gate, enclosed by walls on three sides, and a terrace on which stands a large square structure that may represent the primeval mound that arose from the waters of chaos. As the temple faces east, the structure is likely to be connected with the sun cult of Ra and the resurrection of the king.\nFrom the eastern part of the forecourt, an opening called the Bab el-Hosan ('Gate of the Horseman') leads to an underground passage and an unfinished tomb or cenotaph containing a seated statue of the king. On the western side, tamarisk and sycamore trees were planted beside the ramp leading up to the terrace. At the back of the forecourt and terrace are colonnades decorated in relief with boat processions, hunts, and scenes showing the king's military achievements.\nStatues of the Twelfth Dynasty king Senusret III were found here too.\nThe inner part of the temple was actually cut into the cliff and consists of a peristyle court, a hypostyle hall and an underground passage leading into the tomb itself. The cult of the dead king centred on the small shrine cut into the rear of the Hypostyle Hall.\nThe mastaba-like structure on the terrace is surrounded by a pillared ambulatory along the west wall, where the statue shrines and tombs of several royal wives and daughters were found. These royal princesses were the priestesses of Hathor, one of the main ancient Egyptian funerary deities. Although little remained of the king's own burial, six sarcophagi were retrieved from the tombs of the royal ladies (Ashayet, Henhenet, Kawit, Kemsit, Muyet and Sadhe). Each was formed of six slabs, held together at the corners by metal braces and carved in sunken relief. The sarcophagus of Queen Kawit, now in the Cairo Museum, is particularly fine.\nThe burial shaft and subsequent tunnel descend for 150 meters and end in a burial chamber 45 meters below the court. The chamber held a shrine, which once held the wooden coffin of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep. A great tree-lined court was reached by means of the processional causeway, leading up from the valley temple. Beneath the court, a deep shaft was cut which led to unfinished rooms believed to have been intended originally as the king's tomb. A wrapped image of the pharaoh was discovered in this area by Howard Carter. The temple complex also held six mortuary chapels and shaft tombs built for the pharaoh's wives and daughters.\nArchaeological finds\nOne of the most significant finds at the site is a collection of statues of King Mentuhotep II in various forms. In the court of the temple a sandstone head of Mentuhotep II was found buried and is now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Several seated statues of Mentuhotep II were also found buried possibly indicating a ritual of buried objects  Some of the recovered statues show the king wearing the Red Crown of Lower Egypt, emphasizing his role as a unifier in the First Intermediate Period. At each corner of the temple, foundation deposits were discovered consisting of small tablets made of wood, alabaster and bronze. The deposits contained pottery fragments, animal bones (likely from ritual sacrifices), and tools used in temple construction. These deposits suggest ritual offerings at the start of construction likely intended to sanctify the temple space. \nExcavations revealed tree holes that indicated that sycamore fig trees were planted in the temple's forecourt. Some tree holes contained buried statues which is believed to link the practice of tree planting with ritual protection or regeneration beliefs. Flower beds and irrigation features were also found, indicating that the temple complex included gardens as part of its landscape. \nSome walls of the temple showed evidence of Ptolemaic or later modifications, indicating that parts of the temple were reused in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. There were traces of later burials including a cemetery with poor burials stretching into the temple complex. The temple was likely partially dismantled and repurposed during the New Kingdom, possibly during the nearby construction of Hatshepsut's temple.\n\nMortuary temple of Hatshepsut\nThe focal point of the Deir el-Bahari complex is the Djeser-Djeseru meaning \"the Holy of Holies\", the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut. It is a colonnaded structure, which was designed and implemented by Senenmut, royal steward and architect of Hatshepsut, to serve for her posthumous worship and to honor the glory of Amun.\nDjeser-Djeseru sits atop a series of colonnaded terraces, reached by long ramps that once were graced with gardens. It is built into a cliff face that rises sharply above it, and is largely considered to be one of the \"incomparable monuments of ancient Egypt\". It is 97 feet (30 m) tall.\nThe unusual form of Hatshepsut's temple is explained by the choice of location, in the valley basin of Deir el-Bahari, surrounded by steep cliffs. It was here, in about 2050 BC, that Mentuhotep II, the founder of the Middle Kingdom, laid out his sloping, terrace-shaped mortuary temple. The pillared galleries at either side of the central ramp of the Djeser Djeseru correspond to the pillar positions on two successive levels of the Temple of Mentuhotep.\nDuring the shift into the Ptolemaic (332-30 BCE) and Roman (30 BCE-4th Century CE) periods, the temple became a center for the cult of Amenhotep, son of Hapu and Imhotep. During these periods, the temple became a major cult site for these deified figures, known for their wisdom, healing and oracular powers. Greek inscriptions discovered in the temple provide insight into religious activities, economic functions, and visitors who frequented the site during these later periods. \nToday the terraces of Deir el-Bahari only convey a faint impression of the original intentions of Senenmut. Most of the statue ornaments are missing – the statues of Osiris in front of the pillars of the upper colonnade, the sphinx avenues in front of the court, and the standing, sitting, and kneeling figures of Hatshepsut; some of these were destroyed in a posthumous condemnation of this pharaoh while others were rededicated to Thutmose III. The architecture of the temple has been considerably altered as a result of misguided reconstruction in the early twentieth century AD.\n\nArchitecture\nWhile Hatshepsut used Mentuhotep's temple as a model, the two structures are significantly different. Hatshepsut employed a lengthy colonnaded terrace that deviated from the centralized massing of Mentuhotep's model – an anomaly that may be caused by the decentralized location of her burial chamber.\nThere are three layered terraces reaching 97 feet (30 m) in height. Each 'story' is articulated by a double colonnade of square piers, with the exception of the northwest corner of the central terrace, which employs Proto-Doric columns to house the chapel.\nThese terraces are connected by long ramps which were once surrounded by gardens. The layering of Hatshepsut's temple corresponds with the classical Theban form, employing pylon, courts, hypostyle hall, sun court, chapel, and sanctuary.\nThe relief sculpture within Hatshepsut's temple recites the tale of the divine birth of the pharaoh. The text and pictorial cycle also tell of an expedition to the Land of Punt, an exotic country on the Red Sea coast.\nOn either side of the entrance to the sanctuary (shown right) are painted pillars with images of Hathor as the capitals. Just under the roof is an image of Wadjet, displayed as a bilateral solar symbol, flanked by two other long serpents.\nThe temple includes an image, shown to the right, of Hatshepsut depicted as male pharaoh giving offerings to Horus, and to their left, an animal skin wound around a tall staff that is a symbol of the god Osiris.\nWhile the statues and ornamentation have since been stolen or destroyed, the temple once was home to two statues of Osiris, a long avenue lined by sphinxes, as well as many sculptures of pharaoh Hatshepsut in different attitudes – standing, sitting, or kneeling.\n\nConservation efforts\nSince the early 20th century, continuous archaeological and conservation work has been undertaken to preserve the Temple of Hatshepsut. As part of the UNESCO World Heritage site of Thebes the temple has been a focal point of archaeological and conservation efforts for over a century.\nThe conservation of the Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari has been a continuous effort, addressing structural instability, environmental damage, and past restoration methods. Large-scale excavation and conservation work began in the 19th century with Auguste Mariette, followed by Édouard Naville, who conducted documentation and reconstruction efforts between 1891 and 1908. In the early 20th century, Herbert Winlock and the Metropolitan Museum of Art focused on stabilizing the temple’s walls and reinforcing weakened structures. Later, Émile Baraize of the French Antiquities Service carried out additional reconstructions using stone, concrete, and gypsum, though records of these interventions were limited.\nSince the 1960s, Polish archaeological missions have led major conservation projects, particularly on the festival courtyard, coronation portico, and royal cult complex. The Hatshepsut Chapel, located on the temple's upper terrace has been a primary focus due to its archaeological significance and vulnerability. In the 2000s, modern technologies such as 3D scanning and damage mapping were introduced to assess structural weaknesses, revealing cracks, missing sections, and displaced blocks from earlier restorations. Conservation teams reinforced walls, stabilized the foundations, and analyzed ancient mortars to develop improved preservation methods.\nA significant discovery in 2013 was a tomb beneath the Hatshepsut Chapel containing burials from the 23rd-25th Dynasties, which required additional stabilization measures. Structural reinforcements were implemented, including the installation of a protective manhole for controlled access. Conservationists have also focused on preserving stone surfaces and polychrome decorations affected by environmental exposure. Ongoing research continues to refine preservation strategies with long-term plans integrating climate impact assessments, stone conservation, and controlled reconstruction to maintain the structural and historical integrity of the temple.\n\nMortuary temple of Thutmose III\nThe Mortuary Temple of Thutmose III, also called Djeser-Akhet (Holy of the Horizon), was discovered in 1961; the mortuary temple of Thutmose III was built in at about 1435-1425 BC, late in Thutmose's reign. It overlooks other earlier structures present on the site, such as the temples of Hatshepsut and Mentuhotep Nebhepetre. Built on a steep, artificially leveled terrace, the temple features a basilica-style hypostyle hall with clerestory windows, a rare architectural innovation that foreshadowed the later hypostyle halls of the Ramesside Period. The temple complex was primarily dedicated to Amun-Ra, reflecting the King's close association with the Theban-state god. A key highlight is the Hathor shrine, discovered in 1906, which housed a statue of hathor as a cow protecting the king. The temple's reliefs, recovered in thousands of fragments, show Thutmose III in vibrant polychrome scenes performing rituals, offering to gods, and participating in the Beautiful Festival of the Valley.\nRediscovered in 1962 by a Polish-Egyptian mission, the site revealed column bases, a red granite doorway, and vast amounts of painted limestone and sandstone reliefs. Excavations also uncovered statues of Thutmose III, foundation deposits beneath the Hathor chapel containing botanical offerings, faience amulets, and pottery The temple was heavily damaged by an 11th century BCE earthquake and subsequent stone-robbing, leaving only foundations and scattered architectural elements. Despite its ruinous state, the temple's design closely mirrors Hatshepsut's nearby temple while innovating with its elevated basilica-style hall. Over time the site became a focus for the worship of Hathor during the Third Intermediate Period, as indicated by later votive offerings. Today the reconstructed reliefs and artifacts from Djeser-Akhet contribute significantly to the understanding of royal cult practices and 18th Dynasty temple architecture.\nThere are ongoing conservation efforts including a reconstruction of the temple's layout which have been made difficult by the severity of the destruction in some areas of the temple. Some progress, however, has been made on the reconstruction of the layout of the upper terrace.\n\nRoyal and non-royal tombs\nA tomb (TT320) in a hidden recess in the cliffs to the south of the temples contained a cache of forty royal mummies, moved there from the Valley of the Kings. The bodies had been placed there by Twenty-first Dynasty priests, most likely to prevent further desecration and looting. The tomb was probably originally built for priests of the 21st Dynasty, most likely the family of Pinedjem II. In the cache were found the mummies of Ahmose I, along with the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasty leaders Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose II, Thutmose III, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX. In a separate room were found Twenty-first dynasty High Priests and pharaohs Pinedjem I, Pinedjem II, and Siamun. The discovery of the mummies cache is depicted in the Egyptian movie The Night of Counting the Years (1969).\nIn 1891, a larger cache of 153 reburied mummies of the priests themselves also were found in a tomb at the site, known today as Bab el-Gasus 'Gate of the Priests' (also referred to as the \"Priestly Cache\" or \"Second Cache\").\nPrivate tombs dating from the Middle Kingdom through the Ptolemaic period are also situated here. There are two most notable private tombs at Deir el-Bahari. The first is that of Meketre (TT280), which contained many painted wooden funerary models from the Middle Kingdom and the first recorded human-headed canopic jar.\nThe second, the \"secret\" tomb of Senenmut – the architect and steward who oversaw the construction of the temple for Hatshepsut – was begun in the complex also. Senenmut's tomb was vandalized in antiquity, but some of the relief artwork is still intact. It was meant to be a very large tomb and its corridors are over 100 yards (91 m) long. However, it was never finished and Senenmut was not interred there. He has another tomb, not far from Deir el-Bahari, where his body may have been placed, but it, too, was vandalized and robbed.\nA large area of non-royal tombs in this vicinity is called Sheikh Abd el-Qurna.\n\nStone chest\nIn March 2020 archeologists from Warsaw University's Institute of Archaeology, led by Andrzej Niwiński, discovered a treasure chest and a wooden box dating back 3,500 years in the Egyptian site of Deir el-Bahari.\nThe stone chest contained several items, with all of them covered with linen canvas. Three bundles of flax were found during the excavation. A goose skeleton, sacrificed for religious purposes, was found inside one of them. The second one included goose eggs. It is believed that what the third bundle contained was an ibis egg, which had a symbolic meaning for the ancient Egyptians. In addition, a little wooden trinket box was discovered inside the bundle; the box is believed to contain the name Pharaoh Thutmose II.\nAccording to the Andrzej Niwiński, \"The chest itself is about 40 cm long, with a slight smaller height. It was perfectly camouflaged, looked like an ordinary stone block. Only after a closer look did it turn out to be a chest.\"\n\nContemporary issues and tourism\nToday, Deir el-Bahari is one of Egypt's most visited archaeological sites and part of the UNESCO World Heritage listing \"Ancient Thebes with its Necropolis\". Its restored terraces, particularly Hatshepsut's temple, attract thousands of tourists annually, drawn by the site's architectural beauty and historical significance. The Polish-Egyptian Conservation Project has been instrumental in transforming the once-ruined site into a partially reconstructed monument with accessible terraces, restored statues, and visitor pathways. However, parts of the site such as Mentuhotep II's temple remain off-limits due to their fragile condition. Modern infrastructure including interpretive signage and a visitor center, aims to balance public access with heritage preservation, while the site continues to be a focal point of scholarly research and conservation.\nDeir el-Bahari has also been a focal point for modern security concerns. On November 17, 1997, the site was the scene of the Luxor Massacre, when militants killed over 60 tourists at Hatshepsut's temple, causing a severe blow to Egypt's tourism industry. Since then, the Egyptian government has implemented extensive security measures including armed Tourist Police, metal detectors and surveillance systems. While tourism has recovered in the years since the attack, the event remains a stark reminder of the vulnerability of cultural heritage sites to political violence. Despite this, Deir el-Bahari continues to thrive as a key destination within the Luxor region's tourism economy, representing both a testament to Egypt's enduring legacy and a symbol of resilience in the face of modern threats.\n\nArt\nKaska, Dance of War is a painting by Shefa Salem that depicts Libyan soldiers performing a kaska dance of the Timihu people, which was first recorded 5000 years ago at Deir El-Bahari.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of ancient Egyptian sites\nThebes, Egypt\n\nSources\nMertz, Barbara (1964). \"Temples, Tombs and Hieroglyphs\".

          "content": "The Ramesseum is the memorial temple (or mortuary temple) of Pharaoh Ramesses II (\"Ramesses the Great\"). It is located in the Theban Necropolis in Upper Egypt, on the west of the River Nile, across from the modern city of Luxor. \nIt is the second largest temple in Egypt, occupying an area of c. 10 hectares (1,100,000 sq ft).\nIt was originally called the House of millions of years of Usermaatra-setepenra that unites with Thebes-the-city in the domain of Amun. Usermaatra-setepenra was the prenomen of Ramesses II.\n\nHistory\nRamesses II modified, usurped, or constructed many buildings from the ground up, and the most splendid of these, in accordance with New Kingdom royal burial practices, would have been his memorial temple: a place of worship dedicated to pharaoh, god on earth, where his memory would have been kept alive after his death. Surviving records indicate that work on the project began shortly after the start of his reign and continued for 20 years.\nThe design of Ramesses's mortuary temple adheres to the standard canons of New Kingdom temple architecture. Oriented northwest and southeast, the temple itself comprised two stone pylons (gateways, some 60 metres (200 ft) wide), one after the other, each leading into a courtyard. Beyond the second courtyard, at the centre of the complex, was a covered 48-column hypostyle hall, surrounding the inner sanctuary. An enormous pylon stood before the first court, with the royal palace at the left and the gigantic statue of the king looming up at the back. As was customary, the pylons and outer walls were decorated with scenes commemorating the pharaoh's military victories and leaving due record of his dedication to, and kinship with, the gods. In Ramesses's case, much importance is placed on the Battle of Kadesh (ca. 1274 BC); more intriguingly, however, one block atop the first pylon records his pillaging, in the eighth year of his reign, a city called \"Shalem\", which may or may not have been Jerusalem. The scenes of the great pharaoh and his army triumphing over the Hittite forces fleeing before Kadesh, as portrayed in the canons of the \"epic poem of Pentaur\", can still be seen on the pylon.\nUnlike the massive stone temples that Ramesses ordered carved from the face of the Nubian mountains at Abu Simbel, the inexorable passage of three millennia was not kind to his \"temple of a million years\" at Thebes. This was mostly due to its location on the very edge of the Nile floodplain, with the annual inundation gradually undermining the foundations of this temple and its neighbours. Neglect and the arrival of new faiths also took their toll: for example, in the early years of the Christian Era, the temple was put into service as a Christian church.\nThis is all standard fare for a temple of its kind built at that time. Leaving aside the escalation of scale – whereby each successive New Kingdom pharaoh strove to outdo his predecessors in volume and scope – the Ramesseum is largely cast in the same mould as the ruined temple of Amenhotep III that stood behind the \"Colossi of Memnon\" a kilometre or so away, and Ramesses III's Medinet Habu which closely followed the plan of the Ramesseum. Instead, the significance that the Ramesseum enjoys today owes more to the time and manner of its rediscovery by Europeans.\n\nDescription\nFirst courtyard\nThe Ramesseum was entered through a Pylon which led to the first courtyard. At its rear stood a pair of colossal statues, which flanked the second pylon. The larger of the two was called \"Sun of the princes\" and represented Ramesses, the smaller one his mother Tuya.\nOnly fragments of the base and torso remain of the syenite statue of the enthroned pharaoh, which is estimated to have weighed 1,000 tonnes (2,200,000 lb) with a height of 16–19 metres (52–62 ft). It was transported 220 kilometres (140 mi) from the quarry to the Ramesseum. It is one of the largest colossal statues in the world. However, fragments of four even larger granite colossi of Ramesses were found in Tanis (northern Egypt) with an estimated height of 21 to 28 metres (69 to 92 ft).\n\nSecond courtyard\nRemains of the second court include part of the internal façade of the pylon and a portion of the Osiride portico on the right. Scenes of war and the rout of the Hittites at Kadesh are repeated on the walls. In the upper registers, are shown a feast in honour of the phallic god Min, god of fertility. On the opposite side of the court the few Osiride pillars and columns still left furnish an idea of the original grandeur. Scattered remains of the two statues of the seated king which once flanked the entrance to the temple can also be seen, one in pink granite and the other in black granite. The head of one of these has been removed to the British Museum. Thirty-nine out of the forty-eight columns in the great hypostyle hall, which is 41 by 31 metres (130 by 100 ft), still stand in the central rows. They are decorated with the usual scenes of the king before various gods. Part of the ceiling, decorated with gold stars on a blue, ground has also been preserved. The sons and daughters of Ramesses appear in the procession on the few walls left. The sanctuary was composed of three consecutive rooms, with eight columns and the tetrastyle cell. Part of the first room, with the ceiling decorated with astral scenes, and a few remains of the second room are all that is left.\nAdjacent to the north of the hypostyle hall was a smaller temple; this was dedicated to Ramesses's mother, Tuya, and to his beloved chief wife, Nefertari. To the south of the first courtyard stood the temple palace. The complex was surrounded by various storerooms, granaries, workshops, and other ancillary buildings, some built as late as Roman times.\nA temple of Seti I, of which nothing is now left but the foundations, once stood to the right of the hypostyle hall. It consisted of a peristyle court with two chapel shrines. The entire complex was surrounded by mudbrick walls which started at the gigantic southeast pylon.\nA cache of papyri and ostraca dating back to the Third Intermediate Period (11th to 8th centuries BC) indicates that the temple was also the site of an important scribal school.\nThe site was in use before Ramesses had the first stone put in place: beneath the hypostyle hall, modern archaeologists have found a shaft tomb from the Middle Kingdom, yielding a rich hoard of religious and funerary artefacts.\n\nRamesseum king list\nThe memorial temple of Ramesses II, also called simply the Ramesseum, contains a minor list of pharaohs of ancient Egypt. The scene with the list was first published by Jean-Francois Champollion in 1845, and by Karl Richard Lepsius four years later. \nThe upper register of the second western pylon, shows a processions where ancestors of Ramesses II are honored at ceremonies of the festival of Min. It contains 19 cartouches with the names of 14 pharaohs, listing less pharaohs than his kings list in Abydos. Notably, Hatshepsut and the Amarna pharaohs are omitted.\n\nThe scene is divided in two parts, one with 14 statues of the ancestral kings being carried in a procession on the left side. The second part is a procession led by six kings, but only the name of five remain.\n\nThe scene remains in situ in the upper register of the second western pylon. The later Medinet Habu king list of Ramesses III is very similar in design, but only lists nine pharaohs.\n\nStorage\nThe storerooms surround the temple on three sides, forming three groups, with the oldest behind the temple. The site is notable for its true arches made of mud bricks that were not wedge-shaped as proper voussoirs, but simply held in place by mortar and thus prone to collapse, leaving very few examples still standing. Ramesseum has the oldest such arch still standing in Egypt (c. 1300 BC).\nEach granary in the oldest group was approximately 32 metres (105 ft) in length, 3.7 m (12 ft) wide and 3.5 m (11 ft) high, with a bottom wall thickness of 1.5 m (4.9 ft). The springing level of a barrel vault at the height of approximately 2.5 m (8.2 ft), with arcs build as four courses of mud bricks 40 by 20 by 12 to 14 centimetres (15.7 by 7.9 by 4.7 to 5.5 in) in size.\n\nExcavation and studies\nThe origins of modern Egyptology can be traced to the arrival in Egypt of Napoleon Bonaparte in the summer of 1798.\nWhile undeniably an invasion by an alien imperialist power, this was nonetheless an invasion of its times, informed by Enlightenment ideas: alongside Napoleon's troops went men of science, the same whose toil under the desert sun would later yield the seminal 23-volume Description de l'Égypte. Two French engineers, Jean-Baptiste Prosper Jollois and Édouard de Villiers du Terrage, were assigned to study the Ramesseum site, and it was with much fanfare that they identified it with the \"Tomb of Ozymandias\" or \"Palace of Memnon\" of which Diodorus of Sicily had written in the 1st century BC.\nThe next visitor of note was Giovanni Belzoni, a showman and engineer of Italian origin and, latterly, an archaeologist and antiques dealer. Belzoni's travels took him in 1815 to Cairo, where he sold Mehemet Ali a hydraulic engine of his own invention. There he met British Consul General Henry Salt, who hired his services to collect from the temple in Thebes the so-called 'Younger Memnon', the torso of one of two colossal granite statues depicting Ramesses II, and transport it to England. Thanks to Belzoni's hydraulics and his skill as an engineer (Napoleon's men had failed in the same endeavour a decade or so earlier), the 7-ton stone head arrived in London in 1818, where it was dubbed \"The Younger Memnon\" and, some years later, given pride of place in the British Museum.\n\nIt was against the backdrop of intense excitement surrounding the statue's arrival, and having heard wondrous tales of other, less transportable treasures still in the desert, that the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley penned his sonnet \"Ozymandias\". In particular, one massive fallen statue at the Ramesseum is now inextricably linked with Shelley, because of the cartouche on its shoulder bearing Ramesses's throne name, User-maat-re Setep-en-re, the first part of which Diodorus transliterated into Greek as \"Ozymandias\".\nWhile Shelley's \"vast and trunkless legs of stone\" owe more to poetic license than to archaeology, the \"half sunk... shattered visage\" lying on the sand is an accurate description of part of the wrecked statue. The hands, and the feet, lie nearby. Were it still standing, the Ozymandias colossus would tower 19 m (62 ft) above the ground, rivalling the Colossi of Memnon and the statues of Ramesses carved into the mountain at Abu Simbel.\nThe name of the Ramesseum – or at least its French form Rhamesséion – was coined by Jean-François Champollion, who visited the ruins of the site in 1829 and first identified the hieroglyphs making up Ramesses's names and titles on the walls. \nA joint French-Egyptian team has been exploring and restoring the Ramesseum and its environs since 1991. Among their discoveries during excavations include kitchens, bakeries and supply rooms for the temple to the south, and a school where boys were taught to be scribes to the southeast. Some of the challenges in preserving the area have been the control of modern Egyptian farmers using the area for farming and encroaching on the ruins.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nRamesseum magician's box\nList of largest monoliths in the world\n\nReferences\nSources\nEl-Derby, Abdou A.O.D.; Elyamani, Ahmed (2016-02-29). \"The Adobe Barrel Vaulted Structures In Ancient Egypt: A Study Of Two Case Studies For Conservation Purposes\".

          "content": "Medinet Habu (Arabic: مدينة هابو, romanized: Madīnat Hābū; Ancient Egyptian: ḏꜣmwt; Sahidic Coptic: (ⲧ)ϫⲏⲙⲉ, ϫⲏⲙⲏ, ϫⲉⲙⲉ, ϫⲉⲙⲏ, ϫⲏⲙⲓ; Bohairic Coptic: ϭⲏⲙⲓ) is an archaeological locality situated near the foot of the Theban Hills on the West Bank of the River Nile opposite the modern city of Luxor, Egypt. Although other structures are located within the area and important discoveries have also been made at these sites, the location is today associated almost synonymously with the largest and best preserved site, the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III. It was an important New Kingdom period temple structure in the West Bank of Luxor in Egypt. Aside from its size and architectural and artistic importance, the mortuary temple is probably best known as the source of inscribed reliefs depicting the advent and defeat of the \"sea peoples\" during the reign of Ramesses III (c. 1186–1155 BC), including the Battle of the Delta. Some of the building\nmaterials were re-used from earlier monuments including the destroyed mortuary temple of Tausret (c. 1191–1189 BC) the last known ruler and the final pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt. The Greco-Roman period temple to Isis, Deir el-Shelwit, lies\n4 kilometers to the south and re-used inscribed blocks from Medinet Habu were found there.\nThe site of these temples included an inhabited human settlement since pharaonic times, which continued until the 9th century, by which time it was a Coptic center called Jeme. The last remnants of the former town were cleared during the excavations at the end of the 19th century.\nLocated adjacent to Medinet Habu, north of the outer wall, lies the poorly preserved memorial Temple of Ay (c. 1323–1319 BC) and Horemheb (c. 1300 BC). The temple was originally built by Ay and later usurped by Horemheb who removed all inscriptions and images of Ay. A large Quartzite statue of a Pharaoh that was usurped to represent Horemheb was excavated from the ruins of the Ay and Horemheb temple in the 1930s, and is now on display in the Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures (ISAC). Traces of previous cartouches on the statue confirm that the statue was originally of Tutankhamun, which was overwritten by cartouches of Ay and later Horemheb when the later pharaohs repurposed the statue for the temple.\nJust to the northwest of Medinet Habu the Oriental Institute of Chicago, now called ISAC, excavated a large late Roman period cemetery. Most of the graves had been plundered but a number of artifacts, including 66 mummy tags inscribed in Greek were recovered.\n\nEtymology\nThe origins of the name Medinet Habu are unknown. The earliest attestations are the ones of European cartographers of the 17th–18th centuries who mention it as \"Habu\", \"Medineh el Habou\" and \"Medinet Habu\", with variants \"Medinet Abu\" and \"Medinet Tabu\".\nThe proposed etymologies include derivation from Coptic name for Luxor (Coptic: (ⲡ)ⲁⲡⲉ, romanized: (p)Ape) or from a name of high official of the 18th dynasty who was later deified known as Amenhotep, son of Hapu, (Ancient Egyptian: Jmn-ḥtp.w zꜣ ḥpw), but neither of them is considered plausible, as they do not explain the final long -u. The folk etymology attributes the name to a mythical king named Habu.\nThe old Arabic name of the place, Gabal Shama, (Arabic: جبل شامة) comes from Djami (Coptic: ϫⲏⲙⲉ), which in turn is derived from Ancient Egyptian ḏꜣmwt, of unclear etymology. The Bohairic Coptic form Tchami (Coptic: ϭⲏⲙⲓ) comes from Demotic Tḏmꜣʾ, which is preceded by a feminine article, as also seen in Sahidic ⲧϫⲏⲙⲉ. Whether Thebes (Ancient Greek: Θηβαι) should be a phonetic rendering of the Egyptian name is disputed.\nIn Greek the area was known as Memnonia (Ancient Greek: Μεμνονία) or Kastron Memnonionos (Ancient Greek: Κάστρον Μεμνονίωνος, romanized: castle of Memnon) and was associated with Memnon. This name survives in Colossi of Memnon.\n\nArchaeology\nThe first European to describe the temple in modern literature was Vivant Denon, who visited it in 1799–1801. Jean-François Champollion spent a fortnight and a half at the site, as (Médinet-Habou), in 1829\nas part of the Franco-Tuscan Expedition. John Gardner Wilkinson during 12 years in Egypt recording inscriptions and paintings spent a long period at Thebes. A Prussian expedition led by Karl Richard Lepsius worked in Thebes, mainly at Medinet Habu, from November 1844 until April 1845.\nWork, under the direction of Georges Daressy, Marius Bonnefoy, and Charles Gabet, on the temple took place sporadically between 1859 and 1899, under the auspices of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities to prepare it for tourism. During these decades the main temple was cleared, and a large number of the Greco-Roman period buildings, including a substantial Byzantine Church in the second court, were destroyed without notes or records being taken.\nTheodore M. Davis excavated at Medinet Habu in 1913 focusing primarily on the \"Palace\" of Rameses III along the southern side of the mortuary temple.\nThe further excavation, recording and conservation of the temple has been facilitated in chief part by the Architectural and Epigraphic Surveys of the University of Chicago Oriental Institute, almost continuously since 1924. The Architectural Survey, led by Uvo Hölscher, worked for five seasons until 1932. At the\nstart the complex was \"covered for the most part with mounds of rubbish ranging in height from 3 to 6 meters, the remains of houses from the former Coptic town of Habu\". At the start of work they reported that the \"Egyptian Antiquities Service was excavating Medinet Habu in spring 1925, clearing an area in the south of the precinct, west of the Palace\" activity which is otherwise not recorded. The University of Chicago Oriental Institute Epigraphic Survey under the direction of Harold Hayden Nelson also began in 1924 and the program continues to the present day, excepting a closure between 1940 and 1946 due to World War II. In 1948 Richard Anthony Parker became director of the Epigraphic Survey, followed by George Hughes, Charles Nims, Edward F. Wente, Kent Weeks, Lanny Bell, Peter Dorman, and W. Raymond Johnson in succeeding years. The survey has worked on the long process of photographing, recording, and publishing all reliefs and inscriptions at Medinet Habu.\n\nMortuary Temple of Ramesses III\nThe temple, some 150 m (490 ft) long, is of orthodox design, and closely resembles the nearby mortuary temple of Ramesses II (the Ramesseum). The full formal name of the temple was \"The Temple of Usermare-Meriamon (called) 'United-with-Eternity' in the estate of Amon on the West of Thebes\". Many of the inscriptions and scenes are in similar locations and in some cases largely copied. The temple precinct measures approximately 210 m (690 ft). by 300 m (1,000 ft) and contains more than 7,000 m2 (1.7 acres) of decorated wall reliefs. The temple contains 48 rooms of which 8 constitute the\nMortuary Suite of Rameses III. The reliefs in the Mortuary Suite were devoted to the funerary process\nof Rameses III as Osiride king. The remaining rooms contain reliefs showing the various acts of\nthe living pharaoh. Its walls are relatively well preserved and it is surrounded by a massive mudbrick inner enclosure wall. A radiocarbon sample from the wall\nyielded a date of 1050-1020 ± 50BC.\nThe area between the temple and inner wall originally held numerous temple outbuildings now mostly lost.\nThe entire south wall is inscribed with a liturgical calendar containing 1470\nlines of hieroglyphs. The Ramesseum of Ramesses II was used as a source for\nmuch of the text though that exemplar is now much damaged. The text is mainly\nlists of offerings to be prepared for daily, monthly, and annual feasts. Those\ndates are in the civil calendar (vs one of the two Egyptian religious calendars).\nAn excerpt from Ramesses Ill's Address to Amon-Re:\n\n\"Address of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Lord of the Two Lands:  Usermaatre Meriamon; Son of Re, Lord of Thrones: Ramesses, Prince of On, to his father Amon-Re, King  of the Gods. \"Behold, I know eternity, 0  my august father, and I am not ignorant of everlastingness. \"My heart is glad for I know your strength is more than that  of the [other] gods, since it is you who has fashioned their images and created their majesties [and] you have made the sky  ....\"\n\nThe first pylon leads into an open courtyard, lined with colossal statues of Ramesses III as Osiris on one side, and uncarved columns on the other. The second pylon leads into a peristyle hall, again featuring columns in the shape of Ramesses. The third pylon is reached by continuing up a ramp that leads through a columned portico and then opens into a large hypostyle hall (which has lost its roof). Reliefs and actual heads of foreign captives were also found placed within the temple, perhaps in an attempt to symbolise the king's control over Syria and Nubia.\nIn the Greco-Roman and Byzantine period, there was a church inside the temple structure, which has since been removed. Some of the carvings in the main wall of the temple have been altered by Christian carvings.\n\nTen tombs from the 6th to 8th century BC were found in the inner sanctum of the mortuary temple. Three\ncould be identified including Nesterwy, daughter of 23rd dynasty pharaoh Rudamun,\ndescribed as a \"Songstress in the House of Amen\".\n\nBattle inscriptions\nThere are four long inscriptions describing the battles and deeds of Rameses III at the temple. The inscriptions cover:\n\nYear 5 - First Libyan War. On the temple exterior, second court, south wall, lower register. While dated \"Year 5\" it also mentions events of the Northern War of year 8.\n\nYear 8 - Temple interior, first court, west wall, north of great doorway. Northern War. Well preserved and of great interest to historians as well as the source of endless speculation and wishful thinking by others. The inscription details the invasion from the north, the battle preparations of Rameses III, and his complete defeat of the invaders. The section of most interest:\n\"... As for the foreign countries, they made a [conspiracy] in their isles. [Removed] and scattered in the fray were the lands at one time. No land could stand before their arms, from Hatti, Kode, Carchemish, Yereth, 17 and Yeres on,\" (but they were) cut off at [one time]. A camp [was set up] in one place in Amor. They desolated its people, and its land was like that which has never come into being. They were coming, while the flame was prepared before them, forward toward Egypt. Their confederation was the Peleset, Theker, Shekelesh, Denye(n), and Weshesh, lands united. They laid their hands upon the lands to the (very) circuit of the earth, their hearts confident and trusting: 'Our plans will succeed!' ...\"\nYear 11 - Second Libyan, or Meshwesh, War (poorly preserved). The inscription begins south of the main gateway of the temple and continues on the north of the gateway. The Meshwesh were a western Libyan tribe and were apparently prompted by the Rebu-Libyans to occupy the Egyptian Delta, conquering the Tehenu people who lived in the desert there. Rameses III reports crushing them and taking many captives including \"chief's son, their women, children, weapons, and domestic cattle\". The captives were made slaves.\nYear 12 - Deeds of Rameses III up to that point. On the temple exterior, face of first pylon, south of great gateway. Badly weathered to the point of making it difficult to properly interpret. Talks about the security of Egypt gained by his defeat of all foreign invaders (refers largely to the deeds of the Year 8 inscription) and his work on the Temple of Amon (Medinet Habu).\n\nMilitary reliefs\nThe western and northern walls of the mortuary temple contain a number of reliefs detailing the military activities of Rameses III including his conflicts with the Nubians and Libyans.\nThe combat scenes are accompanied by those showing preparations, for battle and distribution\nof weapons, divine intervention, returning victorious from battle, lion hunt, and the presenting of booty to the gods. These mostly follow the standard pharonic formula.\nOn the north wall are a series of 13 scenes which are viewed as a single military campaign beginning with the Libyans and ending with the \"sea peoples\". In one relief Rameses III and his troops rain arrows down on opponents in ships. In another he leads his troops in the destruction of feather helmeted opponents who are accompanied by\nwomen and children in oxcarts. Over a century ago Gaston Maspero proposed that these two panels represented the invasion of Egypt by purported \"sea peoples\" from Anatolia, a narrative which has now entered common public usage.\n\nTopographical lists\nTwo topographical lists, each toponym in an oval name-shield, are engraved on the front pylon of\nthe mortuary temple with some topynyms now damaged. The identity of many localities is\neither unknown or is disputed. A number were copied from the much damaged topographical\nlist of Rameses II at Karnak. There are 125 mostly Levantine entrees on the south tower of the pylon with the\ninitial 6 being African. The northern tower\nheld a list of mostly African localities, primarily in Nubia. Both lists are topped by a scene of Rameses III smiting kneeling enemies. Another topographical list was inscribed by Rameses IV on the walls of the rear terrace, in\nthe form of scenes showing the pharaoh making offering to the local deity of the\nlocality. They are much damaged by time and later construction though some\nremain legible.\n\nMedinet Habu king list\nThe memorial temple of Ramesses III (Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III) at Medinet Habu contains a minor list of pharaohs of the New Kingdom of Egypt. The inscriptions closely resemble the Ramesseum king list, which is a similar scene of Ramesses II, which was used as a template for the scenes here.\nThe scene shows Ramesses III participating in the ceremonies of the Festival of Min where statues of ancestral kings are carried in an elaborate procession to make offerings to Min. It contains 16 cartouches with the names of nine pharaohs divided into two parts.\nThe sparse outline of the scene was published by Vivant Denon in 1802, who was part of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798 to 1801, which published a slightly more detailed scene in 1809.\nThirty years later, the complete scene including the cartouches of the kings was published by John Gardner Wilkinson in 1837, followed by Champollion and Lepsius. All the 19th-century editions contain omissions and errors, but in 1940 the Epigraphic Survey published the definitive (and complete) rendering of the scenes.\n\nThe scene is divided in two parts, on the left side, 7 statues of ancestors are being carried in a procession. The right side is led by nine kings.\n\nIt remains in situ on the eastern second pylon in the second court, in the upper register on the eastern wall. It's also seen by some as an addition to the Abydos King List, as the Medinet Habu list contains some Rammasside pharaohs who reigned after the Abydos list was made.\n\nProcession of Princes\nOn both sides of the doorway on the west wall of the temple portico there are long processions of royal sons. This reflects an earlier similar relief of Rameses II at Luxor showing a procession of princes at the fest of Opet. The 1st three sons are dressed in flowing robes while the rest are more simply dressed. Originally the figures had no inscriptions, with only deeply cut cartouches of Rameses III between them. A shorter procession of royal daughters, unidentified, are on the south wall.\nAt a later date names and titles were inscribed for ten of the sons. When the new inscriptions were added and their implications are have been long debated. It is generally assumed they were added by either Ramesses IV, Ramesses V and/or Ramesses VI but this is uncertain. At a later date the fourth figure was further modified by Ramesses VIII after his own ascension for reasons that are uncertain. Different identities have been applied to some of the figures including Khaemwaset, Meryatum II, Montuherkhopshef, Meryamun, Pareherwenemef,  and Amun-her-khepeshef.\n\nOuter court of Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III\nThe Mortuary Temple grounds are enclosed by a 315 meter by 210 meter mudbrick temenos wall, rising 18 meters high and 10 meters in thickness. It encompassed 66000 square meters. The wall contain fortified gates in the eastern and western walls. The enclosed grounds hold a few minor archaeological sites. The outer court originally included a large garden with a 20 meter by 18 meter sacred pool, described in the\nPapyrus Harris I of Ramesses III.\n\n\"In front of it [= the temple] I dug a pool copious with water, planted with trees and verdant as the Delta. . . . It was surrounded by arbors, courtyards, and orchards laden with fruit and flowers for thy {= Amon’s] countenance. I built their pavilions . .. and I excavated a pool before them, adorned with lotus blossoms.\"\n\nPalace of Ramesses III\nThe area to the south of the mortuary temple, between the pylons, was occupied by the mudbrick palace\nof Ramesses III. It would have been used by the king only on religious festival\noccasions at which he presided over and to act as his \"Mansion of Millions of Years\" after his death. \nIt had two construction phases. The first phase was a near copy of the earlier Ramesseum palace of Ramesses II. It had two areas, a main throne room complex and\na hallway with a series of 6 small two room apartments. The throne complex was entered via a stairway\nleading into an antechamber with 16 columns (window of appearances). The antechamber led into \na 4 column audience hall with throne dais. The second construction phase used a much \nmore elaborate and larger plan and added a second story. It now filled the entire space\nbetween the inner enclosure walls and the small apartments were turned into\n3 large units, with bathrooms. The palace was much damaged by the 1913 excavation but the\nground plan of the 2nd temple has been restored for visitors to see.\n\nSmall Temple\nJust right of the entrance to the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III is the Small Temple. Excavations\nfound early remains dating back to at least the early New Kingdom and possibly the Middle Kingdom (11th Dynasty). Originally it was dedicated the Ogdoad a group of eight Egyptian gods which were closely associated with Amun. The 18th Dynasty ruler Hatshepsut (c. 1479 – 1458 BC) reported that the temple was \"a sacred place, which the kings of Lower Egypt have [ne]glected\" and her co-ruler Thutmose III (c. 1479-1425 BC) left an inscription there that \"he found (it) ruined\". Hatshepsut began work restoring the temple but\ndied after completing part of the sanctuary. The work was completed by Thutmose III (who also excised all mentions of Hatshepsut in the temple). The sanctuary consists of six rooms, with one room containing large statues of Amun and Thutmose III. In later periods major additions to this were constructed.\nIn his construction at Medinet Habu, Rameses III was careful to respect the older temple.\nThe 11th Dynasty elevated Amun to a major god and the temple became largely associated with him. It has undergone many alterations and modifications over the years, partially in the 20th, 25th, 26th, 29th and 30th dynasties and the Greco-Roman period. A long inscription was added by Pinedjem I (c. 1070-1055 BC) High Priest of Amun at Thebes.\n\nSaite Chapels\nIn the northeast corner of the outer court four combined mausoleums and mortuary shrines were built\nbetween the 8th and 6th centuries BC to the God's Wife of Amun (Divine Votaresses) in the area of the former pool of Ramses III of which two are still extant. The chapels were of \nShepenwepet I, Amenardis I, Shepenwepet II, and Ankhnesneferibré. The\nchapel of Shepenwepet II was modified to also hold a later adortrice, Nitocris I, daughter of pharaoh Psamtik I (664–610 BC). The chapels were constructed mainly of Nubian siliceous sandstone from the quary at Gebel el-Silsila.\n\nTomb of Harsiese\nThe tomb of Harsiese (c. 880–860 BC), Third Intermediate Period ruler of Thebes, was found in 1932. The superstructure was lost in antiquity (though a re-used inscribed block was later found) but the substructure remained. The substructure had an \"inclined entrance passage with steps cut in the floor, an antechamber, and a burial chamber\". It was located \"just outside the enclosure wall of the small temple of Amun called 'Holiest of Places'\".\n\n\"... in the trough of a granite coffin (JE 60137) made for Ramesses II's sister, Henutmire, (and) closed with a hawk-Headed lid. When cleared, four canopic jars were found....No trace of any lids have survived, suggesting that such items may have been of [perishable] wood[.]\"\n\nHouse of Butehamon\nThe remains of the residence of Butehamon (c. 1070 BC) were found in the outer court near the Western Fortified Gate of the mortuary temple. He was the son of Dhutmose and a royal scribe and overseer of the royal treasury in the Theban Necropolis in the 20th dynasty and into 21st dynasty, when the residence would have been built based on papyrus texts. Of the two surviving main rooms, one was square with a stone dais and four stuccoed sandstone columns with palm-leaf capitals. The columns had \"inscriptions and scenes in which Amun-Re and the deified kings Amunhotep I and Ahmose-Nefretere are worshiped as the protecting deities of the  Necropolis\".\n Radiocarbon dating of a palm wood charcoal sample yielded the anomalous date of 1510 ± 40BC.\n\nCoptic settlement\nThe Coptic settlement at Medinet Habu was established as the final stage of a continuous process of occupation of the mortuary complex of Ramses III, which began in pharaonic times and continued into the Roman and late antique period. The settlement was a densely populated town with an estimated population of 18,860 residents, which was installed in various inner sectors, including the temple itself. The settlement pattern matched that of the Karnak and Luxor temples, with large blocks of houses separated by narrow streets and religious buildings as important focal points of the urban texture.\nSeveral churches were built in different sectors of the mortuary temple, including the great five-aisled basilica known as the \"Holy Church of Djeme\", which was located in the second court of Ramses III's temple. The church had a north–south orientation cutting across the original axis of the temple and was provided with a font and a well, placed at the southern end of the central nave. The church was dated between the 5th and the 7th century by Monneret de Villard, while Grossmann suggested an attribution to the middle or second half of the 6th century.\nBefore the clearing of the temple at the end of the 19th century, much of the Coptic town was still visible as it was left after its abandonment in the 9th century. The settlement's religious buildings, including the Holy Church of Djeme, were damaged over time, with one of the Ramesside columns on the east side removed to accommodate the apse and the Osiris pillars cut away since they were inappropriate in a Christian building. Sparse graffiti and damage are all that remain after the removal of the church in modern times.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nMedia related to Medinet Habu at Wikimedia Commons\nColossal statue of Amenhotep III and Tiye\nKarnak King List\nMeryatum II\nMortuary Temple of Amenhotep III\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\n[27] Delpeut, Lonneke, and Frederik Rogner, \"The king himself training his horses: two new perspectives on an unusual scene in Ramesses Ill’s temple at Medinet Habu\", Göttinger Miscellen 268, pp. 49–65, 2022\nDi Cerbo, Christina and Jasnow, Richard, \"Building Dipinti at Medinet Habu (With an Appendix on Remains of Color Decoration in the Palace)\", En détail – Philologie und Archäologie im Diskurs: Festschrift für Hans-W.

          "summary": "Medinet Habu (Arabic: مدينة هابو, romanized: Madīnat Hābū; Ancient Egyptian: ḏꜣmwt; Sahidic Coptic: (ⲧ)ϫⲏⲙⲉ, ϫⲏⲙⲏ, ϫⲉⲙⲉ, ϫⲉⲙⲏ, ϫⲏⲙⲓ; Bohairic Coptic: ϭⲏⲙⲓ) is an archaeological locality situated near the foot of the Theban Hills on the West Bank of the River Nile opposite the modern city of Luxor, Egypt. Although other structures are located within the area and important discoveries have also been made at these sites, the location is today associated almost synonymously with the largest and best preserved site, the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III. It was an important New Kingdom period temple structure in the West Bank of Luxor in Egypt. Aside from its size and architectural and artistic importance, the mortuary temple is probably best known as the source of inscribed reliefs depicting the advent and defeat of the \"sea peoples\" during the reign of Ramesses III (c. 1186–1155 BC), including the Battle of the Delta. Some of the building\nmaterials were re-used from earlier monuments including the destroyed mortuary temple of Tausret (c. 1191–1189 BC) the last known ruler and the final pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt. The Greco-Roman period temple to Isis, Deir el-Shelwit, lies\n4 kilometers to the south and re-used inscribed blocks from Medinet Habu were found there.\nThe site of these temples included an inhabited human settlement since pharaonic times, which continued until the 9th century, by which time it was a Coptic center called Jeme. The last remnants of the former town were cleared during the excavations at the end of the 19th century.\nLocated adjacent to Medinet Habu, north of the outer wall, lies the poorly preserved memorial Temple of Ay (c. 1323–1319 BC) and Horemheb (c. 1300 BC). The temple was originally built by Ay and later usurped by Horemheb who removed all inscriptions and images of Ay. A large Quartzite statue of a Pharaoh that was usurped to represent Horemheb was excavated from the ruins of the Ay and Horemheb temple in the 1930s, and is now on display in the Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures (ISAC). Traces of previous cartouches on the statue confirm that the statue was originally of Tutankhamun, which was overwritten by cartouches of Ay and later Horemheb when the later pharaohs repurposed the statue for the temple.\nJust to the northwest of Medinet Habu the Oriental Institute of Chicago, now called ISAC, excavated a large late Roman period cemetery. Most of the graves had been plundered but a number of artifacts, including 66 mummy tags inscribed in Greek were recovered.",

          "content": "The Colossi of Memnon (Arabic: el-Colossat or es-Salamat) are two large stone statues of the Pharaoh Amenhotep III, which stand at the front of the ruined Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III, the largest temple in the Theban Necropolis. They have stood since 1350 BC, and were well known to ancient Greeks and Romans, as well as early modern travelers and Egyptologists. The statues contain 107 Roman-era inscriptions in Greek and Latin, dated to between AD 20 and 250; many of these inscriptions on the northernmost statue make reference to the Greek mythological king Memnon, whom the statue was then erroneously thought to represent.\nScholars have debated how the identification of the northern colossus as \"Memnon\" is connected to the Greek name for the entire Theban Necropolis as the Memnonium.\n\nDescription\nThe twin statues depict Amenhotep III (fl. 14th century BC) in a seated position, his hands resting on his knees and his gaze facing eastwards (actually ESE in modern bearings) towards the river. Three shorter figures are carved into the front throne alongside his legs: these are his wife Tiye and mother Mutemwiya. The middle between Amenhotep III's ankles would have been an unidentified daughter, although it has been destroyed. The side panels depict the Nile god Hapi.\n\nThe statues are made from blocks of quartzite sandstone which was quarried at el-Gabal el-Ahmar (near modern-day Cairo) and transported 675 km (420 mi) overland to Thebes (Luxor). The stones are believed to be too heavy to have been transported upstream on the Nile. The blocks used by later Roman engineers to reconstruct the northern colossus may have come from Edfu (north of Aswan). Including the stone platforms on which they stand – themselves about 4 m (13 ft) – the colossi reach 18 m (60 ft) in height and weigh an estimated 720 tons each. The two figures are about 15 m (50 ft) apart. The size of the statues makes them visible up to over 10 miles away. Regarding their size; they stood as the guardians of Amenhotep III's mortuary temple. Amenhotep III's process of immortalizing himself in statuary was prevalent, His approach to statuary representation and inscriptions had supported his ideology as being much more than the king of kings. His titles repeatedly called him the \"good god\". Suzanne Bickel describes the height of both colossi were accessible to the surrounding public as a method of allowing all to worship Amenhotep III himself and the gods at his temple.\nBoth statues are quite damaged, with the features above the waist virtually unrecognizable. The southern statue comprises a single piece of stone, but the northern figure has a large extensive crack in the lower half and above the waist consists of 5 tiers of stone. These upper levels consist of a different type of sandstone, and are the result of a later reconstruction attempt, which William de Wiveleslie Abney attributed to Septimius Severus. It is believed that originally the two statues were identical to each other, although inscriptions and minor art may have varied.\nThe original function of the Colossi was to stand guard at the entrance to Amenhotep's memorial temple (or mortuary temple): a massive construct built during the pharaoh's lifetime, where he was worshipped as a god-on-earth both before and after his departure from this world. In its day, this temple complex was the largest and most opulent in Ancient Egypt. Covering a total of 35 hectares (86 acres), even later rivals such as Ramesses II's Ramesseum or Ramesses III's Medinet Habu were unable to match it in area; even the Temple of Karnak, as it stood in Amenhotep's time, was smaller.\n\nFloods\nAmenhotep III had positioned the mortuary temple in front of the floodplain of the Nile in an effort to fill a lake in front of the Colossi. Furthermore, this lake acted as a water retention reservoir and prevented the temple from flooding completely during high inundations. Hourig Sourouzian felt that Amenhotep III did not plan for the site to flood altogether as the surrounding wall for the mortuary temple behind the Colossi was constructed primarily of mud brick.\nWith the exception of the Colossi, however, very little remains today of Amenhotep's temple. It stood on the edge of the Nile floodplain, and successive annual inundations gnawed away at its foundations – a 1840s lithograph by David Roberts shows the Colossi surrounded by water – and it was not unknown for later rulers to dismantle, purloin, and reuse portions of their predecessors' monuments.\n\nRoman era inscriptions\nThe statues contain 107 Roman-era inscriptions in Greek and Latin, dated between 20-250CE; these inscriptions allowed modern travellers to connect the statues to the classical Greek and Latin literature. Many of the inscriptions include the name \"Memnon\". Several of the inscriptions refer to sounds emitted by the statues, the most famous being poetry by Julia Balbilla recording multiple visits during November 130 CE in a party that included the Emperor Hadrian and his wife Vibia Sabina. Of the 107 Roman-era inscriptions: 61 of them are written in Greek, 45 are written in Latin, and one bilingual text is written.\nThey were first studied in detail by Jean-Antoine Letronne in his 1831 La statue vocale de Memnon considérée dans ses rapports avec l'Égypte et la Grèce and then catalogued in the second volume (1848) of his Recueil des inscriptions grecques et latines de l'Égypte.\n\nEarthquakes\nSoon after its construction the temple was destroyed by an earthquake, recently dated by the Armenian Institute of Seismology to around 1200 BC, which left only the two huge colossi at the entrance still standing. These were further destroyed by an earthquake in 27 BC, after which they were partly reconstructed by the Roman authorities.\nThe 1200 BC earthquake also opened numerous chasms in the ground which meant that many statues were buried, some in pristine condition. These have been the subject of extensive restoration and excavation conducted by the Armenian/German archaeologist Hourig Sourouzian, who has revealed that the complex consisted of three pylons, each fronted by colossal statues, while at the far end a rectangular Temple complex consisted of a peristyle court surrounded by columns. So far four of the statues have been re-erected, with eight waiting to be re-erected, while some 200 statues or pieces of statues are in the Luxor Museum, some on display, others in store awaiting conservation.\n\nName\nThe modern Arabic name is Kom el-Hatan, but it is generally known by the Roman name as the Temple of Memnon. Memnon was a hero of the Trojan War and King of Ethiopia, who led his armies from Africa into Asia Minor to help defend the beleaguered city of Troy but was ultimately slain by Achilles. Memnon (whose name means the Steadfast or Resolute) was said to be the son of Eos, the goddess of dawn. He was associated with colossi built several centuries earlier, because of the reported cry at dawn of the northern statue (see below), which became known as the Colossus of Memnon. Eventually, the entire Theban Necropolis became generally referred to as the Memnonium making him \"Ruler of the west\" as in the case of the god Osiris who was called chief of the west.\nIn the 19th century, William de Wiveleslie Abney noted that \"[t]he Arabs called these statues 'Shama' and 'Tama', and when speaking of them together gave them the appelation of Sanamât, or the idols.\"\n\nSounds\nIn 27 BCE, a large earthquake reportedly shattered the northern colossus, collapsing it from the waist up and cracking the lower half. Following its rupture, the remaining lower half of this statue was then reputed to \"sing\" on various occasions – always within an hour or two of sunrise, usually right at dawn. The sound was most often reported in February or March, but this is probably more a reflection of the tourist season rather than any actual pattern.\nThe earliest report in literature is that of the Greek historian and geographer Strabo, who said that he heard the sound during a visit in 20 BCE, by which time it apparently was already well-known. The description varied; Strabo said it sounded \"like a blow\", Pausanias compared it to \"the string of a lyre\" breaking, but it also was described as the striking of brass or whistling. Other ancient sources include Pliny (not from personal experience, but he collected other reports), Tacitus, Philostratus and Juvenal. In addition, the base of the statue is inscribed with about 90 surviving inscriptions of contemporary tourists reporting whether they had heard the sound or not.\nThe legend of the \"Vocal Memnon\", the luck that hearing it was reputed to bring, and the reputation of the statue's oracular powers became known outside of Egypt, and a constant stream of visitors, including several Roman emperors, came to marvel at the statues. The last recorded reliable mention of the sound dates from 196. Sometime later in the Roman era, the upper tiers of sandstone were added (the original remains of the top half have never been found); the date of this reconstruction is unknown, but local tradition places it circa 199, and attributes it to the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus in an attempt to curry favour with the oracle (it is known that he visited the statue, but did not hear the sound).\nVarious explanations have been offered for the phenomenon; these are of two types: natural or man-made. Strabo himself apparently was too far away to be able to determine its nature: he reported that he could not determine if it came from the pedestal, the shattered upper area, or \"the people standing around at the base\". If natural, the sound was probably caused by rising temperatures and the evaporation of dew inside the porous rock.\nSimilar sounds, although much rarer, have been heard from some of the other Egyptian monuments (Karnak is the usual location for more modern reports). Perhaps the most convincing argument against it being the result of human agents is that it did cease, probably due to the added weight of the reconstructed upper tiers.\nSince the northernmost statue is commonly associated with the renowned acoustic phenomenon, much of the literature and cultural discourse tends to overlook the southern counterpart. Despite its significance as a key structure commissioned by Amenhotep III, this oversight persisted. As a result, many Greco-Roman travelers, drawn by the mystique of the site, would etch their names upon the colossi during their visits, leaving behind inscriptions that reflect their fascination and desire for posterity.\n\nGallery\nModern images\nNotable historical images\nSee also\nColossal red granite statue of Amenhotep III\nList of largest monoliths\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nLord Curzon: \"The Voice of Memnon\" in Tales of Travel (1923)\nRupert T.

          "title": "Temple of Edfu",
          "content": "The Temple of Edfu is an Egyptian temple located on the west bank of the Nile in Edfu, Upper Egypt. The city was known in the Hellenistic period in Koine Greek as Ἀπόλλωνος πόλις and in Latin as Apollonopolis Magna, after the chief god Horus, who was identified as Apollo under the interpretatio graeca. It is one of the best preserved shrines in Egypt. The temple was built in the Ptolemaic Kingdom between 237 and 57 BC. The inscriptions on its walls provide important information on language, myth and religion during the Hellenistic period in Egypt. In particular, the Temple's inscribed building texts \"provide details [both] of its construction, and also preserve information about the mythical interpretation of this and all other temples as the Island of Creation.\" There are also \"important scenes and inscriptions of the Sacred Drama which related the age-old conflict between Horus and Seth.\" They are translated by the Edfu-Project.\n\nHistory\nEdfu was one of several temples built during the Ptolemaic Kingdom, including the Dendera Temple complex, Esna, the Temple of Kom Ombo, and Philae. Its size reflects the relative prosperity of the time. The present temple, which was begun \"on 23 August 237 BC, initially consisted of a pillared hall, two transverse halls, and a barque sanctuary surrounded by chapels.\" The building was started during the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes and completed in 57 BC under Ptolemy XII Auletes. It was built on the site of an earlier, smaller temple also dedicated to Horus, although the previous structure was oriented east–west rather than north–south as in the present site. A ruined pylon lies just to the east of the current temple; inscriptional evidence has been found indicating a building program under the New Kingdom rulers Ramesses I, Seti I and Ramesses II. \nA naos of Nectanebo II, a relic from an earlier building, is preserved in the inner sanctuary, which stands alone while the temple's barque sanctuary is surrounded by nine chapels.\nOver the centuries, the temple became buried to a depth of 12 metres (39 ft) beneath drifting desert sand and layers of river silt deposited by the Nile. Local inhabitants built homes directly over the former temple grounds. Only the upper reaches of the temple pylons were visible by 1798, when the temple was identified by a French expedition. In 1860 Auguste Mariette, a French Egyptologist, began the work of freeing Edfu temple from the sands.\nThe Temple of Edfu is nearly intact and a good example of an ancient Egyptian temple. Its archaeological significance and high state of preservation have made it a center for tourism in Egypt and a frequent stop for the many riverboats that cruise the Nile. In 2005, access to the temple was revamped with the addition of a visitor center and paved carpark. A lighting system was added in late 2006 to allow night visits.\n\nReligious significance\nThe temple of Edfu is the largest temple dedicated to Horus and Hathor of Dendera. It was the center of several festivals sacred to Horus. Each year, \"Hathor travelled south from her temple at Denderah to visit Horus at Edfu, and this event marking their sacred marriage was the occasion of a great festival and pilgrimage.\"\n\nCreation myth of the temple\nThe creation myth of the temple of Edfu consists of several related scenes, which are found primarily on the inside of the perimeter walls of the temple.\nThey tell the story of the beginning of the world, when it was still entirely covered by water. During the struggle between land and primeval water, the land managed to come close to the surface. Where this happened, reeds grew with the help of a falcon, which were strengthened by the gods The Far and The Large. The reeds were the germ cell for the temple of Edfu, and here Horus landed, as a falcon. A force approached, in the form of a bird, and fed Horus, the lord of Edfu; This ritual was the beginning of the cult of Edfu.\nThe snakelike Apophis tried to impede the creation. Horus shuddered in fear, yet a harpoon, one of the forms of Ptah, came to the rescue. The enemy was defeated and the creation continued. A falcon formed the sky dome, its wings reaching from horizon to horizon, and the sun began its daily cycle. Then the first temple of Edfu was designed by the gods Thoth and Seshat, one responsible for wisdom, the other for scripture. The godly master-builder constructed the temple according to these plans, but initially not of stone, but of reed.\nThe foundation ritual of the temple consists of multiple elements: First, the ground-plan was laid out with the stretching-the-cord ritual. When the construction was completed, the king handed the temple over to a triad of gods.

          "summary": "The Temple of Edfu is an Egyptian temple located on the west bank of the Nile in Edfu, Upper Egypt. The city was known in the Hellenistic period in Koine Greek as Ἀπόλλωνος πόλις and in Latin as Apollonopolis Magna, after the chief god Horus, who was identified as Apollo under the interpretatio graeca. It is one of the best preserved shrines in Egypt. The temple was built in the Ptolemaic Kingdom between 237 and 57 BC. The inscriptions on its walls provide important information on language, myth and religion during the Hellenistic period in Egypt. In particular, the Temple's inscribed building texts \"provide details [both] of its construction, and also preserve information about the mythical interpretation of this and all other temples as the Island of Creation.\" There are also \"important scenes and inscriptions of the Sacred Drama which related the age-old conflict between Horus and Seth.\" They are translated by the Edfu-Project.",

          "content": "The Temple of Kom Ombo is an unusual double temple in the town of Kom Ombo in Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt. It was constructed during the Ptolemaic dynasty, 180–47 BC. Some additions to it were later made during the Roman period.\n\nArchitecture\nThe building is unique because its 'double' design meant that there were courts, halls, sanctuaries and rooms duplicated for two sets of gods. The southern half of the temple was dedicated to the crocodile god Sobek, god of fertility and creator of the world with Hathor and Khonsu. Meanwhile, the northern part of the temple was dedicated to the falcon god Haroeris (\"Horus the Elder\"), along \"with Tasenetnofret (the Good Sister, a special form of Hathor or Tefnut) and Panebtawy (Lord of the Two Lands)\". The temple is atypical because everything is perfectly symmetrical along the main axis.\n\nDecorations\nThe texts and reliefs in the temple refer to cultic liturgies which were similar to those from that time period. The temple itself had a specific theology. The characters invoked the gods of Kom Ombo and their legend. Two themes were present in this temple: the universalist theme and the local theme. The two combine to form the theology of this temple. A temple was already built in the New Kingdom to honor these gods, however, this site gained in importance during the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Little remains of the New Kingdom temple. The existing temple was begun by Ptolemy VI Philometor (180–145 BC) at the beginning of his reign and added to by other Ptolemies, most notably Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator (51–47 BC), who built the inner and outer hypostyles. The scene on the inner face of the rear wall of the temple is of particular interest, and \"probably represents a set of surgical instruments\".\n\nCurrent state\nMuch of the temple has been destroyed by the Nile, earthquakes, and later builders who used its stones for other projects. Some of the reliefs inside were defaced by Copts, who once used the temple as a church. All the temples buildings in the southern part of the plateau were cleared of debris and restored by Jacques de Morgan in 1893.\n\nCrocodile Museum\nA few of the three hundred crocodile mummies discovered in the vicinity are displayed in The Crocodile Museum.\nIn April 2018, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of the head of the bust of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius during work to protect the site from groundwater.\nIn September 2018, the Egyptian antiquities ministry announced that a sandstone sphinx statue had been discovered at the temple. The statue, measuring approximately 28 cm (11 in) in width and 38 cm (15 in) in height, likely dates to the Ptolemaic Dynasty.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of ancient Egyptian sites, including sites of temples\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nfotopedia.com, Selected photos of the Temple of Kom Ombo",

          "title": "Dendera Temple complex",
          "content": "The Dendera Temple complex (Ancient Egyptian: Iunet or Tantere; the 19th-century English spelling in most sources, including Belzoni, was Tentyra; also spelled Denderah) is located about 2.5 kilometres (1.6 miles) south-east of Dendera, Egypt. It is one of the best-preserved temple complexes of ancient Egypt. The area was used as the sixth nome of Upper Egypt, south of Abydos.\n\nDescription\nThe entirety of the complex is surrounded by a sizable mudbrick wall. Dendera, an oasis on the banks of the Nile, was inhabited by thousands at its peak. Due to its massive size, the structures throughout the complex were constructed over many eras, such as the Middle Kingdom, the Ptolemaic Era, and the period characterized by Roman provincial rule. There is evidence that there was an even earlier building on this site, circa 2250 B.C.E., which could have begun during the reign of Pepi I and completed during the reign of his son, Merenre Nemtyemsaf I. Evidence also exists of a temple in the Eighteenth Dynasty (ca. 1500 BC). The earliest extant (surviving) building in the compound today is the mammisi raised by Nectanebo II – last of the native pharaohs (360–343 BC).\nThe features in the complex include:\n\nHathor temple (the main temple)\nTemple of the birth of Isis\nSacred Lake (source of water for sacred rituals and for everyday use)\nSanatorium\nThis would have functioned similarly to a Roman bathhouse, but strictly for bathing and an overnight stay to manifest healing dreams. The waters at Dendera were sacred and were often used to bless the inscriptions on statues so that they could cure diseases.\nMammisi of Nectanebo II\nBasilica\nRoman Mammisi\na Barque shrine\n(Def.: Boat; French, “barque”/ Late Latin “barca”)\nUsed as a resting place for the statues of the gods when outside of the temple during festivals\nGateways of Domitian and Trajan\nthe Roman Kiosk\nThe Dendera Temple is not to be confused with the Dendera Necropolis, which consists of a series of tombs. The Dendera Necropolis dates back to the Early Dynastic Period and up to the First Intermediate Period, which pre-dates the Middle Kingdom construction of the Temple of Hathor. The necropolis runs across the eastern edge of the western hill and over the northern plain.\n\nHathor temple\nThe temple that dominates this complex, the structure that commands the attention of those who visit, is the Temple of Hathor. The original temple structure underwent continuous modifications throughout the Middle Kingdom and up until the beginning of the reign of the Roman emperor Trajan. The existing temple's structure began construction in 54 B.C.E, the late Ptolemaic period, under the reign of Ptolemy Auletes. The hypostyle hall was built in the Roman period under Tiberius.\nIn Egypt, Trajan was quite active in constructing buildings and decorating them. He appears, together with Domitian, in offering scenes on the propylaeum of the Temple of Hathor. His cartouche also appears in the column shafts of the Temple of Khnum at Esna.\nLayout elements of the temple are:\n\nLarge Hypostyle Hall\nSmall Hypostyle Hall\nLaboratory\nStorage magazine\nOffering entry\nTreasury\nExit to well\nAccess to stairwell\nOffering hall\nHall of the Ennead\nGreat Seat and main sanctuary\nShrine of the Nome of Dendera\nShrine of Isis\nShrine of Sokar\nShrine of Harsomtus\nShrine of Hathor's Sistrum\nShrine of gods of Lower Egypt\nShrine of Hathor\nShrine of the throne of Rê\nShrine of Rê\nShrine of Menat collar\nShrine of Ihy\nThe Pure Place\nCourt of the First Feast\nPassage\nStaircase to roof\nDepictions of Cleopatra VI, which appear on temple walls, are good examples of Ptolemaic Egyptian art. On the rear of the temple exterior is a carving of Cleopatra VII Philopator (the popular, well-known Cleopatra) and her son, Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar (Caesarion), who was fathered by Julius Caesar.\nThere are ten dead deities represented at Dendera, specifically on/in Hathor's temple, that can be connected to the nine dead deities at Horus's temple in Edfu. This would be due to the either parental or marital relationship between Hathor and Horus.\n\nDendera zodiac\nThe sculptured Dendera zodiac (or Denderah zodiac) is a widely known relief found in a late Greco-Roman temple, containing images of the zodiac system still recognized today (i.e. Taurus [bull] and Libra [scales]). A sketch was made during the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt. In 1820 it was removed from the temple ceiling by Frenchmen and later replaced with a copy. There is controversy as to whether they were granted permission by Egypt's ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, to do so, or whether they stole it. (It is also said that in 1822, an antiquities thief using the name \"Claude Le Lorraine,” who should not to be confused with the French Baroque painter, removed the zodiac from Dendera, brought it back to France, and sold it to the King.) The real bas relief is now in the Louvre. Jean-François Champollion, the man who deciphered the Rosetta Stone, dated it back to the Ptolemaic period, and it has been proved that he was correct, as Egyptologists now date it back to the first century BC.\n\nCrypts\nThe Hathor temple's subterranean tombs contain twelve chambers. Some reliefs seen in the tombs are dated to as late as the reign of Ptolemy XII Auletes. The crypts reportedly were used for storing vessels and divine iconography. An opening in the Flame Room floor leads to a narrow chamber with representations on the walls of the objects which were kept in them. In the second chamber, a relief depicts Pepi I offering a statuette of the God Ihy to four images of Hathor. (Hathor is understood to be Ihy's mother.) In the crypt accessible from the Throne Room, Ptolemy XII has jewelry and offerings for the gods.\n\nThe Dendera light\nThe Hathor Temple has stone reliefs that depict Harsomtus, in the form of a snake, emerging from a lotus flower. Harsomtus, also known as Horus, is depicted as one of the ancient gods, a \"primeval creator.\" Harsomtus is likely depicted at the Dendera Temple Complex due to the main temple being dedicated to Hathor. In Egyptian mythology, Harsomtus is referenced as either Hathor's son or lover. In six reliefs he is positioned within an oval container called a hn, which might represent the womb of Nut. These resemble a lamp or light.\n\nProcessional staircase\nThere is a processional stairway leading to the roof of the temple. Reliefs decorating the walls depict scenes from rituals that would have been performed at the temple. The staircase shows wear from millennia of use, but it also shows an apparent accretion of material, which has lent the staircase the informal name of \"the melted stairs.\"\n\nRestoration work\nThe Supreme Council of Antiquities began the project of restoration and maintenance of the temple in 2005. Efforts stopped in 2011 and then resumed in 2017, after the completion of necessary scientific and archaeological studies, along with careful experimental studies using modern techniques. As of March 2021, the second phase of the restoration has been completed, which includes cleaning the Great Pillars Hall and restoring the original colors and clarity of painted scenes on walls and ceilings. More activity continues at the temple, including a cooperative effort started in 2019 with the French Archaeological delegation to turn the temple courtyard into an open museum.\n\nRoman mammisi\nThe Roman mammisi is a subsidiary building dating to the reigns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius. Numerous reliefs of Trajan making offerings to Egyptian deities can be seen. The presence of the Roman mammisi at the Dendera Temple Complex is indicative of the long and complicated history of the Romans in Egypt. As seen in the images below, Roman Emperor Trajan is depicted in the reliefs as an Egyptian Pharaoh and he is making offerings to the Egyptian gods.\n\nRecent discoveries\nIn March 2023, during the recent excavations at the site archaeologists uncovered a limestone sphinx. This sphinx is depicted with a slight grin and dimples and is thought to have been created in the image of the Roman emperor Claudius. On the sphinx's head sits a nemes that has a cobra-shaped tip called a uraeus.\n\nTourism\nThe Dendera complex has long been one of the most tourist-accessible ancient Egyptian places of worship. It is  possible to visit virtually every part of the complex, from the crypts to the roof (at least in February 2025).\n\nGallery\nSee also\nEsna temple (in Esna)\nList of Ancient Egyptian sites\nTomb of Meni\nTomb of Nyibunesu\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nDendera Temple complex. satellite-sightseer.com.\nDendera (French)\nHigh-resolution Images of Dendera Temple Ceiling\n\nBibliography\nArnold, Dieter; Heywood, Ann; Chen, Sara (August 12, 2018). \"Petrified Sound and Digital Color: A Hathor Colum in the New Ptolemaic Galleries.\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

          "content": "Mount Sinai, also known as Jabal Musa (Arabic: جَبَل مُوسَىٰ, lit. 'Mountain of Moses'), is a mountain on the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt. It is one of several locations claimed to be the biblical Mount Sinai, the place where, according to the sacred scriptures of the three major Abrahamic religions (Torah, Bible, and Quran), the Hebrew prophet Moses received the Ten Commandments from God.\nIt is a 2,285-meter (7,497 ft) mountain near the city of Saint Catherine in the region known today as the Sinai Peninsula. It is surrounded on all sides by higher peaks in the mountain range of which it is a part. For example, it lies next to Mount Catherine which, at 2,629 m or 8,625 ft, is the highest peak in Egypt.\n\nGeology\nMount Sinai's rocks were formed during the late stage of the evolution of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Mount Sinai displays a ring complex that consists of alkaline granites intruded into diverse rock types, including volcanics. The granites range in composition from syenogranite to alkali feldspar granite. The volcanic rocks are alkaline to peralkaline, and they are represented by subaerial flows and eruptions and subvolcanic porphyry.\n\nReligious significance\nJudaism and Christianity\nImmediately north of the mountain is the 6th-century Saint Catherine's Monastery. The summit has a mosque that is still used by Muslims, and a Greek Orthodox chapel, constructed in 1934 on the ruins of a 16th-century church, that is not open to the public. The chapel encloses the rock which is considered to be the source for the biblical Tablets of Stone. At the summit also is \"Moses' cave\", where the Hebrew prophet Moses is believed to have waited to receive the Ten Commandments from God.\n\nIslam\nThe Jabal Musa is associated with the Islamic prophet Mūsā ibn ʿImrān (i.e., Moses). In particular, numerous references to Jabal Musa exist in the Quran, where it is called Ṭūr Saināʾ, Ṭūr Sīnīn, and aṭ-Ṭūr and al-Jabal (both meaning \"the Mount\"). As for the adjacent Wād Ṭuwā (Valley of Tuwa), it is considered as being muqaddas (sacred), and a part of it is called Al-Buqʿah Al-Mubārakah (\"The blessed Place\").\n\nAscent and summit\nThere are two principal routes to the summit. The longer and shallower route, Siket El Bashait, takes about 2.5 hours on foot, though camels can be used. The steeper, more direct route (Siket Sayidna Musa) is up the 3,750 \"steps of penitence\" in the ravine behind the monastery.\n\nSee also\nHashem El Tarif\nSacred mountains\nJebel Musa, Morocco, a similarly named mountain in Morocco\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n Mount Sinai travel guide from Wikivoyage\nCaucasian Albanian Alphabet Discovered and Deciphered, Azerbaijan International, Vol. 11:3 (Autumn 2003).

          "content": "Al-Azhar Mosque (Arabic: الجامع الأزهر, romanized: al-Jāmiʿ al-ʾAzhar, lit. 'The Resplendent Congregational Mosque'), known in Egypt simply as al-Azhar, is a mosque in the historic Islamic core of the city of Cairo, Egypt. Commissioned as the new capital of the Fatimid Caliphate in 970 CE, it was the first mosque established in a city that eventually earned the nickname \"the City of a Thousand Minarets\". Its name is usually thought to derive from az-Zahrāʾ (lit. 'the shining one'), a title given to Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad.\nAfter its dedication in 972, and with the hiring by mosque authorities of 35 scholars in 989, the mosque slowly developed into what it is today.\nThe affiliated Al-Azhar University is the second oldest continuously run one in the world after Al-Qarawiyyin in Idrisid Fes. It has long been regarded as the foremost institution in the Islamic world for the study of Sunni theology and sharia, or Islamic law. In 1961, the university, integrated within the mosque as part of a mosque school since its inception, was nationalized and officially designated an independent university, Al-Azhar Al-Sharif, following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.\nOver the course of its over a millennium-long history, the mosque has been alternately neglected and highly regarded. Because it was founded as a Shiite Ismaili institution, Saladin and the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty that he founded shunned al-Azhar, removing its status as a congregational mosque and denying stipends to students and teachers at its school. These moves were reversed under the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule numerous expansions and renovations took place. Later rulers of Egypt showed differing degrees of deference to the mosque and provided widely varying levels of financial assistance, both to the school and to the upkeep of the mosque. Today, al-Azhar remains a deeply influential institution in Egyptian society that is highly revered in the Sunni Muslim world and a symbol of Islamic Egypt.\n\nName\nThe city of Cairo was established by the Fatimid general Jawhar al-Siqilli, on behalf of the Fatimid caliph al-Mu'izz, following the Fatimid conquest of Egypt in 969. It was originally named al-Manṣūriyya (المنصورية) after the prior seat of the Fatimid caliphate, al-Mansuriyya in modern Tunisia. The mosque, first used in 972, may have initially been named Jāmiʿ al-Manṣūriyya (جامع المنصورية, \"the mosque of Mansuriyya\"), as was common practice at the time. It was al-Mu'izz who renamed the city al-Qāhira (القاهرة, \"the Victorious\"). The name of the mosque thus became Jāmiʿ al-Qāhira (جامع القاهرة, \"the mosque of Cairo\"), the first transcribed in Arabic sources.\nThe mosque acquired its current name, al-ʾAzhar, sometime between the caliphate of al-Mu'izz and the end of the reign of the second Fatimid caliph in Egypt, al-Aziz Billah (r. 975–996). ʾAzhar is the masculine form for zahrāʾ, meaning \"splendid\" or \"most resplendent\". Zahrāʾ is an epithet applied to Muhammad's daughter Fatimah, wife of caliph Ali. She was claimed as the ancestress of al-Mu'izz and the imams of the Fatimid dynasty; one theory is that her epithet is the source for the name al-ʾAzhar. The theory, however, is not confirmed in any Arabic source and its plausibility has been both supported and denied by later Western sources.\nAn alternative theory is that the mosque's name is derived from the names given by the Fatimid caliphs to their palaces. Those near the mosque were collectively named al-Quṣūr al-Zāhira (القصور الزاهرة, \"the Brilliant Palaces\") by al-Aziz Billah, and the royal gardens were named after another derivative of the word zahra. The palaces had been completed and named prior to the mosque changing its name from Jāmiʿ al-Qāhira to al-ʾAzhar.\nThe word Jāmiʿ is derived from the Arabic root word jamaʿa (g-m-ʿ), meaning \"to gather\". The word is used for large congregational mosques. While in classical Arabic the name for al-Azhar remains Jāmiʿ al-ʾAzhar, the pronunciation of the word Jāmiʿ changes to Gāmaʿ in Egyptian Arabic.\n\nHistory\nFatimid Caliphate\nAfter the conquest of Egypt, Jawhar al-Siqilli oversaw the construction of the royal enclosure for the caliph's court and the Fatimid army, and had al-Azhar built as a base to spread Isma'ili Shi'a Islam. Located near the densely populated Sunni city of Fustat, Cairo became the center of the Isma'ili sect of Shi'a Islam, and seat of the Fatimid empire.\nJawhar ordered the construction of a congregational mosque for the new city and work commenced on April 4, 970. The mosque was built out of limestone from the Mokattam Formation. The mosque was completed in 972 and the first Friday prayers were held there on June 22, 972 during Ramadan.\nAl-Azhar soon became a center of learning in the Islamic world, and official pronouncements and court sessions were issued from and convened there. Under Fatimid rule, the previously secretive teachings of the Isma'ili madh'hab (school of law) were made available to the general public. Al-Nu'man ibn Muhammad was appointed qadi (judge) under al-Mu'izz and placed in charge of the teaching of the Isma'ili doctrine. Classes were taught at the palace of the caliph, as well as at al-Azhar, with separate sessions available to women. During Eid al-Fitr in 973, the mosque was rededicated by the caliph as the official congregational mosque in Cairo. Al-Mu'izz, and his son—when he in turn became caliph—would preach at least one Friday khutbah (sermon) during Ramadan at al-Azhar.\nYaqub ibn Killis, a polymath, jurist and the first official vizier of the Fatimids, made al-Azhar a key center for instruction in Islamic law in 988. The following year, 45 scholars were hired to give lessons, laying the foundation for what would become the leading university in the Muslim world.\nThe mosque was expanded during the rule of the caliph al-Aziz Billah. According to al-Mufaddal, he ordered the restoration of portions of the mosque and had the ceiling raised by one cubit. The next Fatimid caliph, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (r. 996–1021), would continue to renovate the mosque, providing a new wooden door in 1010. However, al-Hakim's reign saw the completion of the al-Hakim Mosque, and al-Azhar lost its status as Cairo's primary congregational mosque. In May 1009 the al-Hakim Mosque became the sole location for the caliph's sermons; prior to this, al-Hakim would rotate where the Friday sermon was held. Following al-Hakim's reign, al-Azhar was restored by Caliph al-Mustansir Billah (r. 1036–1094). Additions and renovations were carried during the reign of the remaining Fatimid caliphs. Caliph al-Hafiz undertook a major refurbishment in 1138, which established the keel-shaped arches and carved stucco decoration seen in the courtyard today, as well as the dome at the central entrance of the prayer hall.\nInitially lacking a library, al-Azhar was endowed by the Fatimid caliph in 1005 with thousands of manuscripts that formed the basis of its collection. Fatimid efforts to establish Isma'ili practice among the population were, however largely unsuccessful. Much of its manuscript collection was dispersed in the chaos that ensued with the fall of the Fatimid Caliphate, and Al-Azhar became a Sunni institution shortly thereafter.\n\nAyyubid dynasty\nSaladin, who overthrew the Fatimids in 1171, was hostile to the Shi’ite principles of learning propounded at al-Azhar during the Fatimid Caliphate, and under his Ayyubid dynasty the mosque suffered from neglect. Congregational prayers were banned by Sadr al-Din ibn Dirbass, appointed qadi by Saladin. The reason for this edict may have been Shāfi‘ī teachings that proscribe congregational prayers in a community to only one mosque, or mistrust of the former Shi'a institution by the new Sunni ruler. By this time, the much larger al-Hakim Mosque was completed; congregational prayers in Cairo were held there.\nIn addition to stripping al-Azhar of its status as congregational mosque, Saladin also ordered the removal from the mihrab of the mosque a silver band on which the names of the Fatimid caliphs had been inscribed. This and similar silver bands removed from other mosques totaled 5,000 dirhems. Saladin did not completely disregard the upkeep of the mosque and according to al-Mufaddal one of the mosque's minarets was raised during Saladin's rule.\nThe teaching center at the mosque also suffered. The once well stocked library at al-Azhar was neglected, and manuscripts of Fatimid teachings that were held at al-Azhar were destroyed. The Ayyubid dynasty promoted the teaching of Sunni theology in subsidized madrasas (schools) built throughout Cairo. Student funding was withdrawn, organized classes were no longer held at the mosque, and the professors that had prospered under the Fatimids were forced to find other means to earn their living.\nAl-Azhar nevertheless remained the seat of Arabic philology and a place of learning throughout this period. While official classes were discontinued, private lessons were still offered in the mosque. There are reports that a scholar, possibly al-Baghdadi, taught a number of subjects, such as law and medicine, at al-Azhar. Saladin reportedly paid him a salary of 30 dinars, which was increased to 100 dinars by Saladin's heirs. While the mosque was neglected by Saladin and his heirs, the policies of the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty would have a lasting impact on al-Azhar. Educational institutions were established by Sunni rulers as a way of combating what they regarded as the heretical teachings of Shi'a Islam. These colleges, ranging in size, focused on teaching Sunni doctrine, had an established and uniform curriculum that included courses outside of purely religious topics, such as rhetorics, math, and science. No such colleges had been established in Egypt by the time of Saladin's conquest. Saladin and the later rulers of the Ayyubid dynasty would build twenty-six colleges in Egypt, among them the Salihiyya Madrasa.\nAl-Azhar eventually adopted Saladin's educational reforms modeled on the college system he instituted, and its fortunes improved under the Mamluks, who restored student stipends and salaries for the shuyūkh (teaching staff).\n\nMamluk Sultanate\nCongregational prayers were reestablished at al-Azhar during the Mamluk Sultanate by Sultan Baibars in 1266. While Shāfi‘ī teachings, which Saladin and the Ayyubids followed, stipulated that only one mosque should be used as a congregational mosque in a community, the Hanafi madh'hab, to which the Mamluks adhered, placed no such restriction. Al-Azhar had by now lost its association with the Fatimids and Ismāʿīli doctrines, and with Cairo's rapid expansion, the need for mosque space allowed Baibars to disregard al-Azhar's history and restore the mosque to its former prominence. Under Baibars and the Mamluk Sultanate, al-Azhar saw the return of stipends for students and teachers, as well as the onset of work to repair the mosque, which had been neglected for nearly 100 years. According to al-Mufaddal, the emir 'Izz al-Din Aydamur al-Hilli built his house next to the mosque and while doing so repaired the mosque. Al-Maqrizi reports that the emir repaired the walls and roof as well as repaving and providing new floor mats. The first khutbah since the reign of the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim took place on 16 January 1266 with the sermon delivered on a new pulpit completed five days earlier.\nAn earthquake in 1302 caused damage to al-Azhar and a number of other mosques throughout Mamluk territory. The responsibility for reconstruction was split among the amirs (princes) of the Sultanate and the head of the army, Sayf al-Din Salar, who was tasked with repairing the damage. These repairs were the first done since the reign of Baibars. Seven years later, a dedicated school, the Madrasa al-Aqbughawiyya, was built along the northwest wall of the mosque. Portions of the wall of the mosque were removed to accommodate the new building. Construction of another school, the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya began in 1332–1333. This building, which was completed in 1339–1340, would also impact the structure of the mosque as it was built over the site of the mida'a, the fountain for ablution. Both of the madrasas were built as complementary buildings to al-Azhar, with separate entrances and prayer halls.\nThough the mosque had regained its standing in Cairo, repairs and additional work were carried out by those in positions lower than sultan. This changed under the rule of al-Zahir Barquq, the first sultan of the Burji dynasty. Both Sultan Barquq and then Sultan al-Mu'ayyad tried, in 1397 and 1424 respectively, to replace the minaret of al-Azhar with a new one in stone, but on both occasions the construction was found to be defective and had to be pulled down. The resumption of direct patronage by those in the highest positions of government continued through to the end of Mamluk rule. Improvements and additions were made by the sultans Qaytbay and Qansuh al-Ghuri, each of whom oversaw numerous repairs and erected minarets that still stand today. It was common practice among the Mamluk sultans to build minarets, perceived as symbols of power and the most effective way of cementing one's position in the Cairo cityscape. The sultans wished to have a noticeable association with the prestigious al-Azhar. Al-Ghuri may also have rebuilt the dome in front of the original mihrab.\nAlthough the mosque-school was the leading university in the Islamic world and had regained royal patronage, it did not overtake the madrasas as the favored place of education among Cairo's elite. Al-Azhar maintained its reputation as an independent place of learning, whereas the madrasas that had first been constructed during Saladin's rule were fully integrated into the state educational system. Al-Azhar did continue to attract students from other areas in Egypt and the Middle East, far surpassing the numbers attending the madrasas. Al-Azhar's student body was organized in riwaqs (fraternities) along national lines, and the branches of Islamic law were studied. The average degree required six years of study.\nBy the 14th century, al-Azhar had achieved a preeminent place as the center for studies in law, theology, and Arabic, becoming a cynosure for students all around the Islamic world. However, only one third of the ulema (Islamic scholars) of Egypt were reported to have either attended or taught at al-Azhar. One account, by Muhammad ibn Iyas, reports that the Salihiyya Madrasa, and not al-Azhar, was viewed as the \"citadel of the ulema\" at the end of the Mamluk Sultanate.\n\nProvince of the Ottoman Empire\nWith the Ottoman annexation of 1517, despite the mayhem their fight to control the city engendered, the Turks showed great deference to the mosque and its college, though direct royal patronage ceased. Sultan Selim I, the first Ottoman ruler of Egypt, attended al-Azhar for the congregational Friday prayer during his last week in Egypt, but did not donate anything to the upkeep of the mosque. Later Ottoman amirs likewise regularly attended Friday prayers at al-Azhar, but rarely provided subsidies for the maintenance of the mosque, though they did on occasion provide stipends for students and teachers. In contrast to the expansions and additions undertaken during the Mamluk Sultanate, only two Ottoman walīs (governors) restored al-Azhar in the early Ottoman period.\nDespite their defeat by Selim I and the Ottomans in 1517, the Mamluks remained influential in Egyptian society, becoming beys (\"chieftains\"), nominally under the control of the Ottoman governors, instead of amirs at the head of an empire. The first governor of Egypt under Selim I was Khai'r Bey, a Mamluk amir who had defected to the Ottomans during the Battle of Marj Dabiq. Though the Mamluks launched multiple revolts to reinstate their Sultanate, including two in 1523, the Ottomans refrained from completely destroying the Mamluk hold over the power structure of Egypt. The Mamluks did suffer losses—both economic and military—in the immediate aftermath of the Ottoman victory, and this was reflected in the lack of financial assistance provided to al-Azhar in the first hundred years of Ottoman rule. By the 18th century the Mamluk elite had regained much of its influence and began to sponsor numerous renovations throughout Cairo and at al-Azhar specifically.\nAl-Qazdughli, a powerful Mamluk bey, sponsored several additions and renovations in the early 18th century. Under his direction, a riwaq for blind students was added in 1735. He also sponsored the rebuilding of the Turkish and Syrian riwaqs, both of which had originally been built by Qaytbay.\nThis marked the beginning of the largest set of renovations to be undertaken since the expansions conducted under the Mamluk Sultanate. Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda was appointed katkhuda (head of the Janissaries) in 1749 and embarked on several projects throughout Cairo and at al-Azhar. Under his direction, three new gates were built: the Bab al-Muzayinīn (the Gate of the Barbers), so named because students would have their heads shaved outside of the gate, which eventually became the main entrance to the mosque; the Bab al-Sa'ayida (the Gate of the Sa'idis), named for the Sa'idi people of Upper Egypt; and, several years later, the Bab al-Shurba (the Soup Gate), from which food, often rice soup, would be served to the students. A prayer hall was added to the south of the original one, doubling the size of the available prayer space. Katkhuda also refurbished or rebuilt several of the riwaqs that surrounded the mosque. Katkhuda was buried in a mausoleum he himself had built in Al-Azhar; in 1776, he became the first person (and the last) to be interred within the mosque since Nafissa al-Bakriyya, a female mystic who had died around 1588.\nDuring the Ottoman period, al-Azhar regained its status as a favored institution of learning in Egypt, overtaking the madrasas that had been originally instituted by Saladin and greatly expanded by the Mamluks. By the end of the 18th century, al-Azhar had become inextricably linked to the ulema of Egypt. The ulema also were able to influence the government in an official capacity, with several sheikhs appointed to advisory councils that reported to the pasha (honorary governor), who in turn was appointed for only one year. This period also saw the introduction of more secular courses taught at al-Azhar, with science and logic joining philosophy in the curriculum. During this period, al-Azhar saw its first non-Maliki rector; Abdullah al-Shubrawi, a follower of the Shafii madhab, was appointed rector. No follower of the Maliki madhab would serve as rector until 1899 when Salim al-Bishri was appointed to the post.\nAl-Azhar also served as a focal point for protests against the Ottoman occupation of Egypt, both from within the ulema and from among the general public. Student protests at al-Azhar were common, and shops in the vicinity of the mosque would often close out of solidarity with the students. The ulema was also on occasion able to defy the government. In one instance, in 1730–31, Ottoman aghas harassed the residents living near al-Azhar while pursuing three fugitives. The gates at al-Azhar were closed in protest and the Ottoman governor, fearing a larger uprising, ordered the aghas to refrain from going near al-Azhar. Another disturbance occurred in 1791 in which the wāli harassed the people near the al-Hussein Mosque, who then went to al-Azhar to demonstrate. The wāli was subsequently dismissed from his post.\n\nFrench occupation\nNapoleon invaded Egypt in July 1798, arriving in Alexandria on July 2 and moving on to Cairo on July 22. In a bid to placate both the Egyptian population and the Ottoman Empire, Napoleon gave a speech in Alexandria in which he proclaimed his respect for Islam and the Sultan:\n\nPeople of Egypt, you will be told that I have come to destroy your religion: do not believe it! Answer that I have come to restore your rights and punish the usurpers, and that, more than the Mamluks, I respect God, his Prophet and the Koran ... Is it not we who have been through the centuries the friends of the Sultan?\n\nOn July 25 Napoleon set up a diwan made up of nine al-Azhar sheikhs tasked with governing Cairo, the first body of Egyptians to hold official powers since the beginning of the Ottoman occupation. This practice of forming councils among the ulema of a city, first instituted in Alexandria, was put in place throughout French-occupied Egypt. Napoleon also unsuccessfully sought a fatwa from the al-Azhar imams that would deem it permissible under Islamic law to declare allegiance to Napoleon.\nNapoleon's efforts to win over both the Egyptians and the Ottomans proved unsuccessful; the Ottoman Empire declared war on 9 September 1798, and a revolt against French troops was launched from al-Azhar on 21 October 1798. Egyptians armed with stones, spears, and knives rioted and looted. The following morning the diwan met with Napoleon in an attempt to bring about a peaceful conclusion to the hostilities. Napoleon, initially incensed, agreed to attempt a peaceful resolution and asked the sheikhs of the diwan to organize talks with the rebels. The rebels, believing the move indicated weakness among the French, refused. Napoleon then ordered that the city be fired upon from the Cairo Citadel, aiming directly at al-Azhar. During the revolt two to three hundred French soldiers were killed, with 6,000 Egyptian casualties. Six of the ulema of al-Azhar were killed following summary judgments laid against them, with several more condemned. Any Egyptian caught by French troops was imprisoned or, if caught bearing weapons, beheaded. The French troops intentionally desecrated the mosque, walking in with their shoes on and guns displayed. The troops tied their horses to the mihrab and ransacked the student quarters and libraries, throwing copies of the Quran on the floor. The leaders of the revolt then attempted to negotiate a settlement with Napoleon, but were rebuffed.\nNapoleon, who had been well respected in Egypt and had earned himself the nickname Sultan el-Kebir (the Great Sultan) among the people of Cairo, lost their admiration and was no longer so addressed. In March 1800, French General Jean Baptiste Kléber was assassinated by Suleiman al-Halabi, a student at al-Azhar. Following the assassination, Napoleon ordered the closing of the mosque; the doors remained bolted until Ottoman and British assistance arrived in August 1801.\nThe conservative tradition of the mosque, with its lack of attention to science, was shaken by Napoleon's invasion. A seminal innovation occurred with the introduction of printing presses to Egypt, finally enabling the curriculum to shift from oral lectures and memorization to instruction by text, though the mosque itself only acquired its own printing press in 1930. Upon the withdrawal of the French, Muhammad Ali Pasha encouraged the establishment of secular learning, and history, math, and modern science were adopted into the curriculum. By 1872, under the direction of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, European philosophy was also added to the study program.\n\nMuhammad Ali Dynasty and British occupation\nFollowing the French withdrawal, Ali, the wāli (governor) and self-declared khedive (viceroy) of Egypt, sought to consolidate his newfound control of the country. To achieve this goal he took a number of steps to limit, and eventually eliminate, the ability of the al-Azhar ulema to influence the government. He imposed taxes on rizqa lands (tax-free property owned by mosques) and madrasas, from which al-Azhar drew a major portion of its income. In June 1809, he ordered that the deeds to all rizqa lands be forfeited to the state in a move that provoked outrage among the ulema. As a result, Umar Makram, the naqib al-ashraf, a prestigious Islamic post, led a revolt in July 1809. The revolt failed and Makram, an influential ally of the ulema, was exiled to Damietta.\nAli also sought to limit the influence of the al-Azhar sheikhs by allocating positions within the government to those educated outside of al-Azhar. He sent select students to France to be educated under a Western system and created an educational system based on that model that was parallel to, and thus bypassed, the system of al-Azhar.\nUnder the rule of Isma'il Pasha, the grandson of Muhammad Ali, major public works projects were initiated with the aim of transforming Cairo into a European styled city. These projects, at first funded by a boom in the cotton industry, eventually racked up a massive debt which was held by the British, providing an excuse for the British to occupy Egypt in 1882 after having pushed out Isma'il Pasha in 1879.\nThe reign of Isma'il Pasha also saw the return of royal patronage to al-Azhar. As khedive, Isma'il restored the Bab al-Sa'ayida (first built by Katkhuda) and the Madrasa al-Aqbughawiyya. Tewfik Pasha, Isma'il's son, who became khedive when his father was deposed as a result of British pressure, continued to restore the mosque. Tewfik renovated the prayer hall that was added by Katkhuda, aligned the southeastern facade of the hall with the street behind it, and remodeled the facade of the Madrasa al-Aqbughawiya along with several other areas of the mosque. Abbas Hilmi II succeeded his father Tewfik as khedive of Egypt and Sudan in 1892, and continued the renovations started by his grandfather Isma'il. He restructured the main facade of the mosque and built a new three-story riwaq in neo-Mamluk style along the mosque's southwestern corner (known as the Riwaq al-'Abbasi) which was completed in 1901. Under his rule, the Committee for the Conservation of Monuments of Arab Art (also known as the \"Comité\"), also restored the original Fatimid sahn. These renovations were both needed and helped modernize al-Azhar and harmonize it with what was becoming a metropolis.\n\nThe major set of reforms that began under the rule of Isma'il Pasha continued under the British occupation. Muhammad Mahdi al-'Abbasi, sheikh al-Azhar, had instituted a set of reforms in 1872 intended to provide structure to the hiring practices of the university as well as to standardize the examinations taken by students. Further efforts to modernize the educational system were made under Hilmi's rule during the British occupation. The mosque's manuscripts were gathered into a centralized library, sanitation for students improved, and a regular system of exams instituted. From 1885, other colleges in Egypt were placed directly under the administration of the al-Azhar Mosque.\nDuring Sa'ad Zaghloul's term as minister of education, before he went on to lead the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, further efforts were made to modify the educational policy of al-Azhar. While a bastion of conservatism in many regards, the mosque was opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, especially as espoused by the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928. The school attracted students from throughout the world, including students from Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia, providing a counterbalance to the influence of the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia.\nUnder the reign of King Fuad I, two laws were passed that reorganized the educational structure at al-Azhar. The first of these, in 1930, split the school into three departments: Arabic language, sharia, and theology, with each department located in buildings outside of the mosque throughout Cairo. Additionally, formal examinations were required to earn a degree in one of these three fields of study. Six years later, a second law was passed that moved the main office for the school to a newly constructed building across the street from the mosque. Additional structures were later added to supplement the three departmental buildings.\nThe ideas advocated by several influential reformers in the early 1900s, such as Muhammad Abduh and Muhammad al-Ahmadi al-Zawahiri, began to take hold at al-Azhar in 1928, with the appointment of Mustafa al-Maraghi as rector. A follower of Abduh, the majority of the ulema opposed his appointment. Al-Maraghi and his successors began a series of modernizing reforms of the mosque and its school, expanding programs outside of the traditional subjects. Fuad disliked al-Maraghi, and had him replaced after one year by al-Zawahiri, but al-Maraghi would return to the post of rector in 1935, serving until his death in 1945. Under his leadership, al-Azhar's curriculum was expanded to include non-Arabic languages and modern sciences. Al-Zawahiri, who had also been opposed by the ulema of the early 1900s, continued the efforts to modernize and reform al-Azhar. Following al-Maraghi's second term as rector, another student of Abduh was appointed rector.\n\nPost 1952 revolution\nFollowing the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, led by the Free Officers Movement of Mohamed Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, in which the Egyptian monarchy was overthrown, the university began to be separated from the mosque. A number of properties that surrounded the mosque were acquired and demolished to provide space for a modern campus by 1955. The mosque itself would no longer serve as a school, and the college was officially designated a university in 1961. The 1961 law separated the dual roles of the educational institution and the religious institution which made judgments heeded throughout the Muslim world. The law also created secular departments within al-Azhar, such as colleges of medicine, engineering, and economics, furthering the efforts at modernization first seen following the French occupation. The reforms of the curriculum have led to a massive growth in the number of Egyptian students attending al-Azhar run schools, specifically youths attending primary and secondary schools within the al-Azhar system. The number of students reported to attend al-Azhar primary and secondary schools increased from under 90,000 in 1970 to 300,000 in the early 1980s, up to nearly one million in the early 1990s, and exceeding 1.3 million students in 2001.\n\nDuring his tenure as Prime Minister, and later President, Nasser continued the efforts to limit the power of the ulema of al-Azhar and to use its influence to his advantage. In 1952, the waqfs were nationalized and placed under the authority of the newly created Ministry of Religious Endowments, cutting off the ability of the mosque to control its financial affairs. He abolished the sharia courts, merging religious courts with the state judicial system in 1955, severely limiting the independence of the ulema. The 1961 reform law, which invalidated an earlier law passed in 1936 that had guaranteed the independence of al-Azhar, gave the President of Egypt the authority to appoint the sheikh al-Azhar, a position first created during Ottoman rule and chosen from and by the ulema since its inception. Al-Azhar, which remained a symbol of the Islamic character of both the nation and the state, continued to influence the population while being unable to exert its will over the state. Al-Azhar became increasingly co-opted into the state bureaucracy after the revolution—independence of its curriculum and its function as a mosque ceased. The authority of the ulema were further weakened by the creation of government agencies responsible for providing interpretations of religious laws. While these reforms dramatically curtailed the independence of the ulema, they also had the effect of reestablishing their influence by integrating them further into the state apparatus. The 1961 reform law also provided the ulema with the resources of the state, though the purse strings were outside of their control. While Nasser sought to subjugate the ulema beneath the state, he did not allow more extreme proposals to limit the influence of al-Azhar. One such proposal was made by Taha Hussein in 1955. Hussein sought to dismantle the Azharite primary and secondary educational system and transform the university into a faculty of theology which would be included within the modern, secular, collegiate educational system. The ulema opposed this plan, though Nasser's choice of maintaining al-Azhar's status was due more to personal political considerations, such as the use of al-Azhar to grant legitimacy to the regime, than on the opposition of the ulema.\nAl-Azhar, now fully integrated as an arm of the government, was then used to justify actions of the government. Although the ulema had in the past issued rulings that socialism is irreconcilable with Islam, following the Revolution's land reforms new rulings were supplied giving Nasser a religious justification for what he termed an \"Islamic\" socialism. The ulema would also serve as a counterweight to the Muslim Brotherhood, and to Saudi Arabia's Wahhabi influence. An assassination attempt on Nasser was blamed on the Brotherhood, and the organization was outlawed. Nasser, needing support from the ulema as he initiated mass arrests of Brotherhood members, relaxed some of the restrictions placed on al-Azhar. The ulema of al-Azhar in turn consistently supported him in his attempts to dismantle the Brotherhood, and continued to do so in subsequent regimes. Despite the efforts of Nasser and al-Azhar to discredit the Brotherhood, the organization continued to function. Al-Azhar also provided legitimacy for war with Israel in 1967, declaring the conflict against Israel a \"holy struggle\".\nFollowing Nasser's death in 1970, Anwar Sadat became President of Egypt. Sadat wished to restore al-Azhar as a symbol of Egyptian leadership throughout the Arab world, saying that \"the Arab world cannot function without Egypt and its Azhar\". Recognizing the growing influence of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sadat relaxed several restrictions on the Brotherhood and the ulema as a whole. However, in an abrupt about-face, in September 1971 a crackdown was launched on journalists and organizations that Sadat felt were undermining or attacking his positions. As part of this effort to silence criticism of his policies, Sadat instituted sanctions against any of the ulema who criticized or contradicted official state policies. The ulema of al-Azhar continued to be used as a tool of the government, sparking criticism among several groups, including Islamist and other more moderate groups. Shukri Mustafa, an influential Islamist figure, accused the ulema of providing religious judgments for the sole purpose of government convenience. When Sadat needed support for making peace with Israel, which the vast majority of the Egyptian population regarded as an enemy, al-Azhar provided a decree stating that the time had come to make peace.\nHosni Mubarak succeeded Sadat as President of Egypt following Sadat's assassination in 1981. While al-Azhar would continue to oblige the government in granting a religious legitimacy to its dictates, the mosque and its clergy were given more autonomy under Mubarak's regime. Under Jad al-Haq, the sheikh of al-Azhar from 1982 until his death in 1994, al-Azhar asserted its independence from the state, at times criticizing policies of the state for instigating extremist Islamist sects. Al-Haq argued that if the government wished al-Azhar to effectively combat groups such as al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya then al-Azhar must be permitted greater independence from the state and for it to be allowed to make religious declarations without interference. Under Mubarak, a number of powers of the state were ceded to al-Azhar. During the 1990s, modifications to existing censorship laws gave al-Azhar the ability to censor both print and electronic media. Though the law stipulates that al-Azhar may only become involved following a complaint, in practice its role has been much more pervasive; for example, television scripts were routinely sent to al-Azhar for approval prior to airing.\nAl-Azhar continues to hold a status above other Sunni religious authorities throughout the world, and as Sunnis form a large majority of the total Muslim population al-Azhar exerts considerable influence on the Islamic world as a whole. In addition to being the default authority within Egypt, al-Azhar has been looked to outside of Egypt for religious judgments. Prior to the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia's King Fahd asked for a fatwa authorizing the stationing of foreign troops within the kingdom, and despite Islam's two holiest sites being located within Saudi Arabia, he asked the head sheikh of al-Azhar instead of the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia. In 2003, Nicolas Sarkozy, at the time French Minister of the Interior, requested a judgment from al-Azhar allowing Muslim girls to not wear the hijab in French public schools, despite the existence of the French Council of Islam. The sheikh of al-Azhar provided the ruling, saying that while wearing the hijab is an \"Islamic duty\" the Muslim women of France are obligated to respect and follow French laws. The ruling drew much criticism within Egypt as compromising Islamic principles to convenience the French government, and in turn the Egyptian government.\n\nPost 2011 revolution\nAl-Azhar was not unaffected by the 2011 Egyptian revolution that saw the removal of Hosni Mubarak as president of Egypt. Student government elections in the months following the revolution resulted in an overwhelming victory for the once banned Muslim Brotherhood. Protests demanding that the military junta ruling Egypt restore the mosque's independence from the state broke out, and the mosque itself commissioned the writing of a draft law that would grant al-Azhar greater independence from the government. Within al-Azhar, debate on its future and rightful role within the state has replaced what had been a mollified single-voice in support of the policies of the Mubarak regime. The various views on al-Azhar's future role in Egypt come from several parties, including leading Islamist organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood, liberal voices that wish to see al-Azhar stand as a bulwark against ultra-conservative Islamists (known as Salafists), and those that hope to see al-Azhar become wholly independent from the state and in complete control of its finances, leadership, and further that it be placed in charge of the religious ministries of the state.\n\nIn 2018 a major restoration of the mosque was completed, financed by both King Abdullah and King Salman of Saudi Arabia. Among the goals of the restoration was the reinforcement of the building's foundations, the restoration of its architectural elements, and upgrades to its infrastructure. The Bab al-Muzayinīn (Gate of the Barbers), formerly one of the main public entrances to the mosque, has been made less accessible as a result of the restoration project.\nIn 2020, representatives from the mosque spoke out against sexual violence in Egypt, prompted by the social media campaign instigated by student Nadeen Ashraf.\n\nArchitecture\nFoundation and structural evolution under Fatimids\nThe original structure of the mosque was 280 feet (85 m) in length and 227 feet (69 m) wide, and was made up of three arcades situated around a courtyard. To the southeast of the courtyard was the original prayer hall, built as a hypostyle hall, five aisles deep, though with its qibla wall slightly off the correct angle. The marble columns supporting the four arcades that made up the prayer hall were reused from sites extant at different times in Egyptian history, from Pharaonic times through Roman rule to Coptic dominance. The different heights of the columns were made level by using bases of varying thickness. The stucco exterior shows influences from Abbasid, Coptic and Byzantine architecture.\n\nUltimately a total of three domes were built, a common trait among early north African mosques, although none of them have survived Al-Azhar's many renovations. The historian al-Maqrizi recorded that in the original dome al-Siqilli inscribed the following:In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate; according to the command for its building from the servant of Allah, His governor abu Tamim Ma'ad, the Imam al-Mu‘izz li-Dīn Allāh, Amir al-Mu'minin, for whom and his illustrious forefathers and his sons may there be the blessings of Allah: By the hand of his servant Jawhar, the Secretary, the Ṣiqillī in the year 360. Gawhar included the honorific Amir al-Mu'minin, Commander of the Faithful, as the Caliphs title and also included his nickname \"the Secretary\" which he had earned serving as a secretary prior to becoming a general.\n K. A. C. Creswell wrote that the original structure certainly had one dome, and likely a second for symmetry.\nThe original mihrab, uncovered in 1933, has a semi-dome above it with a marble column on either side. Intricate stucco decorations were a prominent feature of the mosque, with the mihrab and the walls ornately decorated. The mihrab had two sets of verses from the Quran inscribed in the conch, which is still intact. The first set of verses are the three that open al-Mu’minoon:The next inscription is made up of verses 162 and 163 of al-An'am:These inscriptions are the only surviving piece of decoration that has been definitively traced to the Fatimids.\n\nThe marble paved central courtyard was added between 1009 and 1010. The arcades that surround the courtyard have keel shaped arches with stucco inscriptions. The arches were built during the reign of al-Hafiz li-Din Allah. The stucco ornaments also date to his rule and were redone in 1891. Two types of ornaments are used. The first appears above the center of the arch and consists of a sunken roundel and twenty-four lobes. A circular band of vegetal motifs was added in 1893. The second ornament used, which alternates with the first appearing in between each arch, consists of shallow niches below a fluted hood. The hood rests on engaged columns which are surrounded by band of Qu'ranic writing in Kufic script. The Qu'ranic script was added after the rule of al-Hafiz but during the Fatimid period. The walls are topped by a star shaped band with tiered triangular crenellations. The southeastern arcade of the courtyard contains the main entrance to the prayer hall. A Persian framing gate, in which the central arch of the arcade is further in with a higher rectangular pattern above it, opens into the prayer hall.\nA new wooden door was installed during the reign of al-Hakim in 1009. In 1125, al-Amir installed a new wooden mihrab. An additional dome was constructed during the reign of al-Hafiz li-Din Allah. He additionally ordered the creation of a fourth arcade around the courtyard and had a porch built on the western end of the sahn.\n\nMamluk additions\nThe Fatimid dynasty was succeeded by the rule of Saladin and his Ayyubid dynasty. Initially appointed vizier by the last Fatimid Caliph Al-'Āḍid (who incorrectly thought he could be easily manipulated), Saladin consolidated power in Egypt, allying that country with the Sunni Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad. Distrusting al-Azhar for its Shi'a history, the mosque lost prestige during his rule. However, the succeeding Mamluk dynasty made restorations and additions to the mosque, overseeing a rapid expansion of its educational programs. Among the restorations was a modification of the mihrab, with the installation of a polychrome marble facing.\n\nMadrasa al-Taybarsiyya\nThe Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya, which contains the tomb of Amir Taybars, was built in 1309. Originally intended to function as a complementary mosque to al-Azhar it has since been integrated with the rest of the mosque. The Maliki and Shāfi‘ī madh'hab were studied in this madrasa, though it now is used to hold manuscripts from the library. The only surviving piece from the original is the qibla wall and its polychrome mihrab. Al-Maqrizi reported that the madrasa was used only for studying the Shāfi‘ī while the historian Ibn Duqmaq reported that one of the liwans in the madrasa was reserved for Shāfi‘ī teachings while the other was for Maliki teachings.\nThe madrasa was completely rebuilt by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda, leaving only the southeastern wall and its mihrab untouched. The mihrab was described by K. A. C. Creswell as being \"one of the finest in Cairo\". The niche of the mihrab is 1.13 meters (3.7 ft) wide and 76 centimeters (30 in) deep. On each side of the niche stands a 2.78 meters (9.1 ft) high porphyry column. Above the columns are impost blocks decorated with colored geometrical designs. The semi-dome at the top of the mihrab is set within an outer arch. Surrounding this arch is a molding that forms a rectangular outer frame. This is the first mihrab in Egypt to have this type of frame. Inside the frame are glass mosaics depicting pomegranate trees.\n\nMadrasa and mausoleum of Aqbugha\nA dome and minaret cover the Madrasa al-Aqbughawiyya, which contains the tomb of Amir Aqbugha, which was built in 1339. Intended by its founder, another Mamluk amir called Sayf al-Din Aqbugha 'Abd al-Wahid, to be a stand-alone mosque and school, the madrasa has since become integrated with the rest of the mosque. It includes both a small tomb chamber and a larger hall, both with mihrabs. The entrance, qibla wall, and the mihrabs with glass mosaics are all original, while the pointed dome was rebuilt in the Ottoman period. Parts of the facade were remodeled by Khedive Tewfik in 1888. The top of the minaret was remodelled by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda so as to have a pointed top like the other Ottoman-style minarets he built around the entrances of the mosque, but at some point after 1932 the top was once again refashioned to end with a Mamluk-style finial which we see today.\n\nMadrasa Gawhariyya\nBuilt in 1440, the Madrasa Gawhariyya contains the tomb of Gawhar al-Qanaqba'i, a Sudanese eunuch who became treasurer to the sultan. The floor of the madrasa is marble, the walls lined with cupboards, decoratively inlaid with ebony, ivory, and nacre. The tomb chamber is covered by small stone dome whose exterior is carved with an arabesque pattern, making it one for the earliest domes in Cairo with this type of decoration (later refined in the dome of Qaytay's mausoleum in the Northern Cemetery). The structure was restored between 1980 and 1982.\n\nMinaret of Qaytbay\nBuilt in 1483 or in 1495, it has a square base, a transitional segment leading into an octagonal shaft, then a 10-sided polygon shaft, followed by a cylindrical shaft that consists of 8 brick pillars, each two adjoined by bricks in between. The Minaret of Qaytbay also has three balconies, supported by muqarnas, a form of stalactite vaulting which provide a smooth transition from a flat surface to a curved one (first recorded to have been used in Egypt in 1085), that adorn the minaret. The first shaft is octagonal is decorated with keel-arched panels on each side, with a cluster of three columns separating each panel. Above this shaft is the second octagonal shaft which is separated from the first by a balcony and decorated with plaiting. A second balcony separates this shaft with the final cylindrical shaft, decorated with four arches. Above this is the third balcony, crowned by the finial top of the minaret.\nThe minaret is believed to have been built in the area of an earlier, Fatimid-era brick minaret that had itself been rebuilt several times. Contemporary accounts suggest that the Fatimid minaret had defects in its construction and needed to be rebuilt several times, including once under the direction of Sadr al-Din al-Adhra'i al-Dimashqi al-Hanafi, the qadi al-qudat (Chief Justice of the Highest Court) during the rule of Sultan Baibars. Recorded to have been rebuilt again under Barquq in 1397, the minaret began to lean at a dangerous angle and was rebuilt in 1414 by Taj al-Din al-Shawbaki, the walī and muhtasib of Cairo, and again in 1432. The Qaytbay minaret was built in its place as part of a reconstruction of the entrance to the mosque.\n\nGate of Qaytbay\nDirectly across the courtyard from the entrance from the Bab al-Muzayinīn is the Gate of Qaytbay. It is a refined example of the late Mamuk architectural and decorative style. Built in 1495, this gate leads to the court of the prayer hall.\n\nMinaret of al-Ghuri\nThe double finial minaret was built in 1509 by Qansuh al-Ghuri. Sitting on a square base, the first shaft is octagonal, and four sides have a decorative keel arch, separated from the adjacent sides with two columns. The second shaft, a 12-sided polygon separated from the first by fretted balconies supported by muqarnas, is decorated with blue faience. A balcony separates the third level from the second shaft. The third level is made up of two rectangular shafts with horseshoe arches on each side of both shafts. Atop each of these two shafts rests a finial atop two identical onion shaped bulbs, with a balcony separating the finials from the shafts.\n\nOttoman renovations and additions\nSeveral additions and restorations were made during Ottoman reign in Egypt, many of which were completed under the direction of Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda who nearly doubled the size of the mosque. Three gates were added by Katkhuda, the Bab al-Muzayinīn (see below), which became the main entrance to the mosque, the Bab al-Shurba (the Soup Gate), and the Bab al-Sa'ayida (the Gate of the Sa'idis). To each gate he added a pointed Ottoman-style minaret, of which one was later demolished during the creation of al-Azhar Street. For the Bab al-Muzayinīn, which was adjacent to the Madrasa al-Aqbughiyya, he remodelled the top of Aqbugha's minaret to make it resemble the other Ottoman minarets (though the top was later rebuilt again in a Mamluk style during the 20th century). Several riwaqs were added, including one for the blind students of al-Azhar, as well as refurbished during the Ottoman period. Katkhuda also added an additional prayer hall south of the original Fatimid hall, with an additional mihrab, doubling the total prayer area. His overall work reintegrated the mosque's disparate elements in a relatively unified whole.\n\nBab al-Muzayinīn\nThe Bab al-Muzayinīn (\"Gate of the Barbers\", Arabic: باب المزينين) was built in 1753. Credited to Katkhuda the gate has two doors, each surrounded by recessed arches. Two molded semi-circular arches with tympanums decorated with trefoils stand above the doors. Above the arches is a frieze with panels of cypress trees, a common trait of Ottoman work.\nA free-standing minaret, built by Katkhuda, originally stood outside the gate. The minaret was demolished prior to the opening of al-Azhar street by Tewfik Pasha during modernization efforts which took place throughout Cairo.\n\nCurrent layout and structure\nThe present main entrance to the mosque is the Bab al-Muzayinīn, which opens into the white marble-paved courtyard at the opposite end of the main prayer hall. To the northeast of the Bab al-Muzayinīn, the courtyard is flanked by the façade of the Madrasa al-Aqbughawiyya; the southwestern end of the courtyard leads to the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya. Directly across the courtyard from the entrance to the Bab al-Muzayinīn is the Bab al-Gindi (Gate of Qaytbay), built in 1495, above which stands the minaret of Qaytbay. Through this gate lies the courtyard of the prayer hall.\nThe mihrab has recently been changed to a plain marble facing with gold patterns, replacing some of the Mamluk marble facing, but the stucco carvings in the semi-dome are likely from the Fatimid era.\n\nSee also\nBab al-Futuh\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\nIslam in Egypt\nList of mosques in Cairo\nList of mosques in Egypt\nSabil-Kuttab of Katkhuda\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\nSources\nExternal links\n Media related to Al-Azhar Mosque at Wikimedia Commons",
          "summary": "Al-Azhar Mosque (Arabic: الجامع الأزهر, romanized: al-Jāmiʿ al-ʾAzhar, lit. 'The Resplendent Congregational Mosque'), known in Egypt simply as al-Azhar, is a mosque in the historic Islamic core of the city of Cairo, Egypt. Commissioned as the new capital of the Fatimid Caliphate in 970 CE, it was the first mosque established in a city that eventually earned the nickname \"the City of a Thousand Minarets\". Its name is usually thought to derive from az-Zahrāʾ (lit. 'the shining one'), a title given to Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad.\nAfter its dedication in 972, and with the hiring by mosque authorities of 35 scholars in 989, the mosque slowly developed into what it is today.\nThe affiliated Al-Azhar University is the second oldest continuously run one in the world after Al-Qarawiyyin in Idrisid Fes. It has long been regarded as the foremost institution in the Islamic world for the study of Sunni theology and sharia, or Islamic law. In 1961, the university, integrated within the mosque as part of a mosque school since its inception, was nationalized and officially designated an independent university, Al-Azhar Al-Sharif, following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.\nOver the course of its over a millennium-long history, the mosque has been alternately neglected and highly regarded. Because it was founded as a Shiite Ismaili institution, Saladin and the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty that he founded shunned al-Azhar, removing its status as a congregational mosque and denying stipends to students and teachers at its school. These moves were reversed under the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule numerous expansions and renovations took place. Later rulers of Egypt showed differing degrees of deference to the mosque and provided widely varying levels of financial assistance, both to the school and to the upkeep of the mosque. Today, al-Azhar remains a deeply influential institution in Egyptian society that is highly revered in the Sunni Muslim world and a symbol of Islamic Egypt.",

          "content": "الجامع الازهر هو اهم مساجد مصر على الاطلاق، واحد المعاقل التاريخيه لنشر وتعليم الاسلام كذلك هو واحد من اشهر المساجد الاثريه في مصر والعالم الاسلامي، وجزء من مؤسسه الازهر الشريف يعود تاريخ بنائه الى بدايه عهد الدوله الفاطميه في مصر، بعدما اتم جوهر الصقلي فتح مصر سنه 969م، وشرع في تاسيس القاهره قام بانشاء القصر الكبير واعده لنزول الخليفه المعز لدين الله، وفي اثناء ذلك بدا في انشاء الجامع الازهر ليصلي فيه الخليفه، وليكون مسجداً جامعاً للمدينه حديثه النشاه اسوه بجامع عمرو في الفسطاط وجامع ابن طولون في القطائع، كذلك اعد وقتها ليكون معهداً تعليمياً لتعليم المذهب الشيعي ونشره، فبدا في بناؤه في جمادي الاول 359هـ/970م، واتم بناءه واقيمت اول جمعه فيه في رمضان سنه 361هـ /972م، وعرف بجامع القاهره ورغم ان يد الاصلاح والترميم توالت عليه على مر العصور فغيرت كثيراً من معالمه الفاطميه الا انه يعد اقدم اثر فاطمي قائم بمصر. وقد اختلف المؤرخون في اصل تسميه هذا الجامع، والراجح ان الفاطميين سموه بالازهر تيمناً بفاطمه الزهراء ابنه النبي محمد.\nيعتبر المسجد ثاني اقدم جامعه قائمه بشكل مستمر في العالم بعد جامعه القرويين. ورغم ان جامع عمرو بن العاص في الفسطاط سبقه في وظيفه التدريس حيث كانت تعقد فيه حلقات الدرس تطوعاً وتبرعاً، الا ان الجامع الازهر يعد الاول في مصر في تاديه دور المدارس والمعاهد النظاميه، فكانت دروسه تعطى بتكليف من الدوله ويؤجر عليها العلماء والمدرسين. والقي اول درس فيه في صفر سنه 365هـ/975م على يد علي بن النعمان القاضي في فقه الشيعه، وفي سنه 378هـ/988م قررت مرتبات لفقهاء الجامع واعدت داراً لسكناهم بجواره وكانت عدتهم خمسه وثلاثين رجلاً.\nبعد سقوط الدوله الفاطميه افل نجم الازهر على يد صلاح الدين الايوبي الذي كان يهدف من وراء ذلك الى محاربه المذهب الشيعي ومؤازره المذهب السني، فابطلت الخطبه فيه وظلت معطله مائه عام الى ان اعيدت في عهد السلطان المملوكي الظاهر بيبرس البندقداري. وفي عهد الدوله المملوكيه عاد الازهر ليؤدي رسالته العلميه ودوره الحيوي، فعين به فقهاء لتدريس المذهب السني والاحاديث النبويه وعنى بتجديده وتوسعته وصيانته فعد ذلك العصر الذهبي للازهر، كما اظهر الحكام والاعيان في العصور التاليه اهتماماً ملحوظاً بترميمه وصيانته واوقفت عليه اوقافاً كثيره.\nفي عهد الملك فؤاد الاول صدر القانون رقم 46 لسنه 1930 للازهر والذي بموجبه انشات كليات اصول الدين والشريعه واللغه والعربيه لاحقاً سنه 1933، واصبح للازهر رسميًا جامعه مستقله في عام 1961. وقد اعتبرت جامعه الازهر الاولى في العالم الاسلامي لدراسه المذهب السني والشريعه الاسلاميه. ولا يزال الازهر حتى اليوم مناره لنشر وسطيه الاسلام ومؤسسه لها تاثير عميق في المجتمع المصري ورمزاً من رموز مصر الاسلاميه.\n\nالتسميه\nتاسست مدينه القاهره على يد جوهر الصقلي، وهو قائد فاطمي رومي من اصل يوناني من جزيره صقليه، واطلق عليها اسم المنصوريه، واُعِدَّت المنصوريه لتكون مقراً للخلافه الفاطميه المتواجده في تونس، وقد استخدم المسجد لاول مره في عام 972، وسُمّي في البدايه بجامع المنصوريه، وقد كانت تسميه المسجد باسم المدينه التي يتواجد بها ممارسه شائعه في ذلك الوقت، ومع دخول الخليفه المعز لدين الله لمصر قام بتسميه المدينه بالقاهره، وهكذا اصبح اسم المسجد جامع قاهره، حسب اول نسخه من المصادر العربيه التاريخيه.\nاكتسب المسجد اسمه الحالي، الازهر، في وقت ما بين الخليفه المعز، ونهايه عهد الخليفه الفاطمي الثاني في مصر العزيز بالله، والازهر معناه المشرق وهو صيغه المذكر لكلمه الزهراء، والزَّهْرَاءُ لقبُ السيده فاطمه بنتِ الرسول محمد، زوجه الخليفه علي بن ابي طالب، وقد ادعى المعز وائمه الدوله الفاطميه انهم من سلفهم؛ وهي النظريه الوحيده المتداوله عن سبب تسميه الازهر بهذا الاسم، ومع ذلك، لم تُؤَكَّد هذه النظريه في اي مصدر عربي، وقد استُحْسِن دعمها كلياً، وقد نفتها مصادر غربيه في وقت لاحق.\nيُقدم اخرون نظريه بديله تتمثل في ان اسم المسجد اشتق من الاسماء التي قدمها الخلفاء الفاطميين الى قصورهم القريبه من المسجد، فقد اطلقوا على قصورهم القصور الزاهره تيمنًا بالحدائق الملكيه بها التي اختيرت من قبل العزيز بالله، وبعد ان انتُهِىَ من القصور؛ غُيِّر اسم المسجد من جامع القاهره الى الازهر. اما اشتقاق كلمه جامع من جذر الكلمه العربيه الجامعه، وتعني «الجمع»، ويتم استخدام الكلمه للتعبير عن المساجد التي تجمع الكثير من الناس.\n\nالتاريخ\nفي عصر الدوله الفاطميه (التاسيس)\nفي عهد الخليفه الفاطمي المعز لدين الله الامام الاسماعيلي الرابع، قامت الجيوش الفاطميه بغزو مصر تحت قياده جوهر الصقلي، والذي نجح في انتزاعها من سلاله الاخشيديين، وبامر من الخليفه، اشرف جوهر على بناء المركز الملكي «للخلافه الفاطميه» وجيشها، وقد بنى الازهر كقاعده لنشر مذهب الشيعه الاسماعيليه، والذي يقع بالقرب من مدينه الفسطاط السنيه، وقد اصبحت القاهره مركزاً للطائفه الاسماعيليه الشيعيه، ومقر حكم الدوله الفاطميه. وعلى ذلك امر جوهر ببدء بناء مسجد كبير للمدينه الجديده، وقد بدا العمل في انشائه سنه 970، واتم في سنه 972، فعقدت اول صلاه جمعه فيه في 22 يونيو 972 خلال شهر رمضان.\nسرعان ما اصبح الازهر مركزًا للتعليم، وتخرج منه التصريحات الرسميه وتُعقد به جلسات المحاكم، واصبحت التعاليم الباطنيه الخاصه بالمذهب الاسماعيلي - والتي كانت تعاليم سريه لفتره طويله - متاحه لعامه الناس في الازهر، وقد عين المعز القاضي النعمان بن محمد القاضي، مسؤولاً عن تدريس المذهب الاسماعيلي، وكانت بعض الفصول تُدرَّس في قصر الخليفه، وكذلك في الازهر، مع دورات منفصله للنساء، وخلال عيد الفطر عام 973، رُسِّمَ المسجد مسجدًا رسميًّا لصلاه الجماعه في القاهره بامر من الخليفه المعز وابنه عندما اصبح بدوره الخليفه، وجعلوا خطبه الجمعه خلال شهر رمضان في الازهر.\nكما جعل يعقوب بن كلس - الفقيه والوزير الرسمي الاول للفاطميين - من الازهر مركزًا رئيسيًا لتعليم القانون الاسلامي في عام 988، وفي السنه التاليه، وُظِّفَ 45 عالمًا لاعطاء الدروس، ليتحول الازهر الى جامعه رائده في العالم الاسلامي.\nوُسِّع المسجد اثناء حكم الخليفه العزيز (975–996). ووفقا للمفضل فان العزيز امر بترميم اجزاء من المسجد كانت قد تصدعت، واستكمل الخليفه الفاطمي التالي الحاكم بامر الله ترميم المسجد ووفَّر بابًا خشبيًا جديدًا في عام 1010. ومع ذلك، شهد عهد الحاكم تشييد مسجده الذي سمي باسمه تيمنا به، ويعد تشييد مسجد الحاكم فقد الازهر مركزه كمسجد صلاه الجماعه الاولى في القاهره. وفي ايار/مايو 1009 اصبح مسجد الحاكم بامر الله المكان الوحيد لخطب الخليفه وخطبه الجمعه. وبعد عهد الحاكم استعاد الازهر مكانه في عهد المستنصر، وقد نُفِّذَت اضافات وتجديدات على المسجد، كما اضيفت الكثير من التجديدات في عهد الخلفاء الفاطميين الذين اتوا من بعده.\nاُنشِئت مكتبهٌ ضخمهٌ تابعهٌ للجامع الازهر وهبها الخليفه الفاطمي في 1005 الالاف من المخطوطات التي اعطت قيمه بليغه للمكتبه، وكان ذلك ضمن محاوله الفاطميين بشتى الجهود نشر ممارسه المذهب الاسماعيلي بين الناس، ولكن لم تنجح جهودهم، فالكثير من هذه المخطوطات فُرِقَّت في الفوضى التي تلت سقوط «الدوله الفاطميه»، واصبح الازهر فيما بعد مؤسسه سنيه كبيره.\n\nفي عصر الدوله الايوبيه\nكان صلاح الدين الايوبي الذي اطاح بالفاطميين عام 1171 معادياً لمبادئ التعاليم الشيعيه التي رُوِّجَت في الازهر اثناء الخلافه الفاطميه، لذلك اُهِمَل المسجد خلال حكم السلاله الايوبيه لمصر، وحظر صدر الدين بن درباس الصلاه فيه، وهو قاضٍ عين من قبل صلاح الدين الايوبي، والسبب في هذا المرسوم قد يكون بسبب الفقه الشافعي الذي يرى بعدم جواز خطبتين في بلد واحد، وقد يكون بسبب عدم الثقه في الجامع باعتباره مؤسسه شيعيه، واصبح مسجد الحاكم بامر الله وهو المسجد الذي تُجرى فيه صلاه الجماعه وخطبه الجمعه في القاهره.\nبالاضافه الى تجريد الازهر من مركزه كمسجد صلاه الجماعه، امر صلاح الدين الايوبي ايضاً بازاله شريط فضه ادرجت فيه اسماء الخلفاء الفاطميين عليه من محراب المسجد. كذلك امر بازاله شرائط فضيه مماثله من المساجد الاخرى بلغت قيمتها 5000 درهم. لم يتجاهل صلاح الدين الايوبي تماماً صيانه المسجد، ووفقا للمفضل فان احدى ماذن المسجد رممت خلال حكم صلاح الدين.\nكما افل نجم الازهر كمركز للتعليم الديني،  فسُحِبَ تمويل الطلاب، ولم تعد دروس الفقه تعقد في المسجد، واضطر الاساتذه الذين ذاع صيتهم في عهد الفاطميين الى البحث عن وسائل اخرى لكسب عيشهم. كما تعرضت مكتبه المسجد الضخمه للاهمال، ودمرت مخطوطات التعاليم الفاطميه التي كانت تُدرَّس في الازهر. ومع ذلك ظل الازهر مكاناً لتعليم بعض العلوم الاخرى طوال تلك الفتره، فبينما تم ايقاف فصول الدراسه الرسميه في الجامع، الا انه استمرت الدروس الخاصه لتعليم اللغه العربيه، وتذكر بعض المصادر ان البغدادي درَّس عددًَا من المواضيع مثل القانون والطب في الازهر، وقد امر صلاح الدين بان يُدفع له راتبًا قُدر بـ 30 دينار، ثم ارتفع الى 100 دينار من خلفاء صلاح الدين الايوبي، على الجانب الاخر شجع الايوبيون تدريس الفقه السني في المدارس المعانه، التي بنيت في جميع انحاء القاهره،  وانشئت المؤسسات التعليميه من قبل الحكام السنيين كوسيله لمكافحه ما يعتبرونه هرطقه تعاليم «الشيعه»، وقد كانت هذه الكليات تتراوح في حجمها وتركز على تعليم المذهب السني، وكان لها منهجًا ثابتًا وموحدًا شمل دورات خارج مواضيع دينيه محضه، مثل البلاغه، والرياضيات، والعلوم، وقد بُنيت 26 مدرسه سنيه في مصر فقط خلال عهد صلاح الدين والحكام الايوبيين الذين اتوا من بعده، منها المدرسه الصالحيه.\nاعتمد الازهر في نهايه المطاف الاصلاحات التعليميه التي فرضها صلاح الدين، وتحسنت حظوظه في عهد المماليك، الذين اعادوا رواتب الطلاب ورواتب الشيوخ.\n\nفي عصر الدوله المملوكيه\nاعيد اقامه الصلاه في الازهر اثناء حكم المماليك بامر من السلطان بيبرس في 1266، ومع التوسع السريع في القاهره، والحاجه الى دور المسجد، قام السلطان بيبرس بتجاهل تاريخ الازهر كمؤسسه لنشر المذهب الشيعي الاسماعيلي، وامر بعوده رواتب الطلاب والمعلمين، فضلا عن بدايه العمل لاصلاح المسجد، الذي اهمل منذ ما يقرب من 100 سنه. ووفقا للمفضل، فان الامير عز الدين ايدامور الهيلي بنى منزله بجوار المسجد، لمراقبه اعمال الاصلاح. وقد ذكر تقي الدين المقريزي ان الامير اصلح الجدران والسقف، ووفَّر الحصير الجديد. والقيت الخطبه الاولى منذ عهد الخليفه الفاطمي الحاكم في 16 كانون الثاني/يناير 1266، وقد القيت الخطبه على منبر جديد انتهى تجهيزه قبل الخطبه بخمسه ايام.\n\nفي عام 1302 تسبب زلزال باضرار كبيره للازهر وعدد من المساجد الاخرى في جميع انحاء مصر. وتم تقسيم مسؤوليه اعاده الاعمار بين امراء السلطنه وكان المكلف بترميم الازهر هو الامير سالار، ليتولى بذلك اول اعمال اصلاح منذ عهد بيبرس، وبعد سبع سنوات تم بناء المدرسه الاقبغاويه على طول الجدار الذي يقع في الشمال الغربي من المسجد، وتمت ازاله اجزاء من جدار المسجد لاستيعاب المبنى الجديد، وبدات اشغال بناء مدرسه اخرى، سميت بالمدرسه الطيبرسيه في 1332-1333. وقد اكتمل هذا المبنى في 1339-1340، وبنى ايضا هيكل للمسجد، ونافوره للوضوء. وبنيت كل المدارس والمباني المكمله للازهر، بمداخل وقاعات صلاه منفصله.\nعلى الرغم من ان المسجد قد استعاد مكانته في عهد المماليك، الا ان اعمال التصليح والتوسعه، نفذت باوامر من هم في مواقع اقل من السلطان، وقد تغير هذا في ظل حكم الظاهر برقوق، اول المماليك الشركس، الذي اولى المسجد رعايته المباشره، وخلال اواخر حكم المماليك ادخلت تحسينات واضافات من قبل السلطانين قايتباي وقنصوه الغوري، فاشرف كل منهما على العديد من الاصلاحات وبناء الماذن. وقد كانت هناك ممارسه شائعه بين سلاطين المماليك لبناء الماذن، ويُنظر اليها على انها رمز القوه والطريقه الاكثر فعاليه في تدعيم صوره مدينه القاهره، وتمنى كل سلطان ان تكون له لمسه مرموقه في الازهر.\nعلى الرغم من ان مسجد الازهر كان جامعه رائده في العالم الاسلامي واستعاد الرعايه الملكيه، الا انه لم يتفوق على المدارس الاخرى، كمكان مفضل للتعليم بين النخبه في القاهره. واستمرت سمعه الازهر بوصفه مكانًا مستقلًا للتعليم، في حين ان المدارس الدينيه التي تم بنائها خلال حكم صلاح الدين الايوبي كانت مندمجه تماما في النظام التعليمي للدوله. واستمر الازهر في جذب الطلاب من مناطق اخرى في مصر والشرق الاوسط، وتجاوز اعداد الطلاب به اعداد الذين يحضرون المدارس الدينيه الاخرى، وجرت دراسه فروع الشريعه الاسلاميه بمتوسط مده دراسه ست سنوات. في القرن الرابع عشر حقق الازهر مكانه بارزه باعتباره مركز لدراسات الشريعه والفقه واللغه العربيه، واصبح قبله الانظار للطلاب من جميع انحاء العالم الاسلامي. حتى بلغ عدد من درسوا به حوالي ثلث علماء المسلمين في مصر.\n\nفي عصر الدوله العثمانيه\nخلال بدايه عهد الخلافه العثمانيه سنه 1517 اظهر الاتراك احتراماً كبيراً للمسجد وكُليته، على الرغم من توقف الرعايه الملكيه المباشره له، فقد حضر السلطان سليم الاول بعد دخوله الى مصر صلاه الجمعه في الجامع الازهر، وذلك خلال الاسبوع الاخير له في مصر، كذلك كان يحضر الامراء العثمانيين بانتظام لصلاه الجمعه في الازهر، ولقد وفَّر العثمانيون رواتب للطلاب والمعلمين؛ لكن نادرًا ما يتم القيام باي تطويرات او توسيعات بالمسجد خلال العهد العثماني، على عكس عهد المماليك التي اُجريت فيه الكثير من التوسعات والاضافات.\nظل للمماليك تاثير خاص في المجتمع المصري على الرغم من هزيمتهم على يد سليم الاول والعثمانيين في عام 1517، فاصبحوا بايات وولاه في الدوله العثمانيه، بدلا من امراء واصحاب دوله وامبراطوريه. ويعتبر خاير بك اول حاكم لمصر في عهد سليم الاول بعد يونس باشا، وهو امير مملوكي انشق الى العثمانيين خلال معركه مرج دابق، وعلى الرغم من ان المماليك قاموا بثورات متعدده لاعاده دوله المماليك، بما في ذلك ثورتان في عام 1523، فلم يقم العثمانيون بالاباده الكامله للمماليك على في مصر.\nوقد عانى المماليك من خسائر – اقتصاديه وعسكريه على حد سواء – في اعقاب انتصار العثمانيين، وهذا ينعكس في عدم وجود المساعدات الماليه المقدمه الى الازهر في اول مئه عام من الحكم العثماني. وفي القرن الثامن عشر استطاع نخبه من المماليك استعاده الكثير من نفوذهم، وقامو بتجديدات عديده في جميع انحاء القاهره والازهر.\nوقد قام القازدوغلي بك المملوكي بالعديد من الاضافات والتجديدات في بدايه القرن 18. وتحت ادارته اُضِيف رواق للطلاب المكفوفين في سنه 1735. وقام ايضا باعاده بناء اروقه تركيه وسوريه، وكلاهما قد بنيت في الاصل في عهد قايتباي.\nثم اجريت توسعات كبيره على يد عبد الرحمن كتخدا، وقد عين كتخدا (رئيسا للانكشاريه) في 1749، وشرع في عده مشاريع في جميع انحاء القاهره والازهر. وتحت ادارته بُنِيَت ثلاث بوابات جديده للجامع: باب المزينين (بوابه الحلاقين)، وقد سُمِّى بذلك لانه يخرج منه الطلاب لحلق رؤوسهم، الذي اصبح في نهايه المطاف المدخل الرئيسي للمسجد؛ وباب الصعايده، ومخصص لدخول اهل صعيد مصر، وفي وقت لاحق انشئ باب الشربه، والشربه هي حساء الارز وهي من الاكلات التي غالباً يتم تقديمها الى الطلاب، واضيفت قاعه للصلاه في جنوب المُصلى الاصلي، وضوعفت ايضا حجم المساحه المتاحه للصلاه. وقام كتخدا ايضا بتجديد او اعاده بناء العديد من الاروقه التي تحيط بالمسجد. ودفن كتخدا في الازهر في عام 1776، واصبح كتخدا الشخص الاول (والاخير) الذي يدفن داخل المسجد منذ نفيسه البكريه التي توفيت حوالي عام 1588.\nخلال العهد العثماني استعاد الازهر مركزه كاكبر مؤسسه تعليميه في مصر، متجاوز المدارس الدينيه التي اسسها صلاح الدين الايوبي، وتوسع الازهر بشكل كبير بجهود المماليك. وبنهايه القرن الثامن عشر، اصبح الازهر مرتبطًا ارتباطًا وثيقا بعلماء مصر، وقد كان للعلماء القدره على التاثير على الحكومه بصفه رسميه، وتم تعيين عده شيوخ في المجالس الاستشاريه التي تقدم التقارير الى الباشا، هذه الفتره شهدت ادراج دورات تعليميه اكثر لتُدرَّس في الازهر، مع العلم والمنطق ضُمَّت الفلسفه في المناهج الدراسيه. وخلال هذه الفتره، شهد الازهر اول شيخ للازهر ليس من المذهب المالكي وهو عبد الله الشبراوي الشافعي المذهب، ولم يعد منصب شيخ الازهر من المالكيه حتى عام 1899 عندما اصبح سليم البشري شيخًا للازهر.\nكان الازهر ايضا بمثابه نقطه محوريه للاحتجاجات ضد الولاه اثناء الحكم العثماني لمصر، سواء كانت الاحتجاجات داخل اوساط العلماء او داخل اوساط الطلبه او من عامه الناس. وقد كانت الاحتجاجات الطلابيه التي عقدت في الازهر شائعه بين عامه الناس، واغلقت المحلات التجاريه في محيط المسجد تضامنا مع الطلاب، كما كان ايضا العلماء في بعض الاحيان قادرين على تحدي الحكومه.\nما بين 1730–1731، قام اغاوات الدوله العثمانيه بمضايقه السكان المقيمين بالقرب من الازهر اثناء ملاحقه بعض الهاربين، واغلقت البوابات في الازهر احتجاجا على ذلك، وامر الحاكم العثماني الاغاوات الامتناع عن الذهاب قرب الازهر، خوفاً من قيام انتفاضه كبرى، وقد حدث اضطراب اخر في عام 1791 تسبب فيه مضايقات الوالي قرب مسجد الامام الحسين، ثم ذهب الى الازهر لتبرير موقفه. وقد اقيل الوالي بعد ذلك من منصبه.\n\nالحمله الفرنسيه\nغزا نابليون مصر في يوليو 1798، فوصل الى الاسكندريه يوم 2 يوليو ودخل القاهره يوم 22 يوليو، وفي محاوله لاسترضاء السكان المصريين والامبراطوريه العثمانيه، القى نابليون خطابا في الاسكندريه والذي اعلن فيه عن مدى احترامه للاسلام والسلطان:\n\nوفي 25 يوليو انشا نابليون ديوان يتكون من تسعه شيوخ الازهر، وكلفهم باداره القاهره، وهي اول هيئه رسميه من المصريين منذ بدايه الحكم العثماني، وشكل اول مجلس في الاسكندريه، وشمل لاحقا جميع انحاء مصر الخاضعه للاحتلال الفرنسي، وقد سعى نابليون ايضا لفتوى من ائمه الازهر، التي من شانها تنص بجواز الولاء لنابليون بموجب الشريعه الاسلاميه، لكن من غير جدوى.\nوباءت جهود نابليون للهيمنه على المصريين والعثمانيين بالفشل؛ فقد اعلنت الامبراطوريه العثمانيه الحرب في 9 سبتمبر 1798، وبدات ثوره ضد القوات الفرنسيه من الازهر في 21 اكتوبر 1798، وقام المصريون المسلحون بالحجاره والرماح فقط باعمال بطوليه ضد جيش نابليون الجرار، وفي صباح اليوم التالي اجتمع الديوان مع نابليون في محاوله للتوصل الى نهايه سلميه للاعمال العدائيه، وقد غضب نابليون في البدايه، لكنه وافق لمحاوله التوصل الى حل سلمي، وطلب من شيوخ الديوان تنظيم محادثات مع الثوار، وقد اعتبر الثوار هذه الخطوه تدل على ضعف الفرنسيين ورفضوها، وعلى اثر هذا امر نابليون باطلاق النار على المدينه من قلعه القاهره، وتصويب النار على الازهر مباشره. وخلال التمرد قتل حوالي ثلاثمائه جندي فرنسي، واُصيب 3,000 مصري، وقتل سته من علماء الازهر بعد ان حُكم بالاعدام عليهم، وقد القت القوات الفرنسيه القبض على كل مصري شارك في المظاهرات ووضع في السجن، واذا وجدوا عنده سلاح قُطع راسه، وقد دنست القوات الفرنسيه المسجد عمدًا، ومشوا فيه باحذيتهم والبنادق المعروضه. وقامت القوات بربط خيولها في المحراب ونهب ارباع الطلاب والمكتبات، ورموا نسخًا من القران على الارض. ثم حاول قاده الثوره التفاوض على التسويه مع نابليون، ورُفِضَ طلبهم.\nوفقد نابليون احترام واعجاب المصريين بعد قيام الثوره، بعد ان كان يحظى باحترام كبير في مصر، وبعد ان لُقِّب بـ السلطان العظيم بين الناس في القاهره، وفي مارس 1800، اُغتيل الجنرال الفرنسي جان بابتيست كليبر على يد سليمان الحلبي، وهو طالب في الازهر. وبعد عمليه الاغتيال، امر نابليون باغلاق المسجد، وظلت ابوابه مغلقه حتى وصول المساعدات العثمانيه والبريطانيه في اغسطس 1801، وقد فقد المسجد الكثير من محتوياته بغزو نابليون.\nاستفاد الازهر كثيرًا من ابتكار اله الطباعه الحديثه، التي اضافت بدورها بُعْدًا اخر في مجال التعليم، وقد تحولت المناهج الدراسيه من محاضرات عن طريق الفم وتحفيظ للدرس بالنص الى محاضرات مطبوعه، ولقد اكتسب مطبعه خاصه به في عام 1930.\nبعد انسحاب الفرنسيين، شجع محمد على باشا على ادخال التعليم غير الديني في الازهر مثل دراسه التاريخ والرياضيات والعلوم الحديثه، وقد اعتُمِد على المناهج الدراسيه التي كانت تلقى قبل عام 1872، تحت اشراف جمال الدين الافغاني، كما اضيفت الفلسفه الاوروبيه لمناهج الدراسه.\n\nمحمد علي والاحتلال البريطاني\nبعد انسحاب الفرنسيين، قام الوالي محمد علي بتعيين نفسه خديويًّا (اميرًا) على مصر، وسعى لتوطيد سيطرته على مصر الحديثه التي اسسها، ولتحقيق هذه الغايه فقد اتخذ عددا من الخطوات للحد، والقضاء على قدره علماء الازهر للتاثير على الحكومه. وفرض ضرائب على اراضي رزقه (وهي اراضٍ تابعه للمساجد) والمدارس الدينيه، كما قام ايضا باخذ جزء كبير من مداخيل الازهر،  وفي يونيو 1809، امر بمصادره جميع اراضي رزقه وضمها الى املاك الدوله في خطوه اثارت غضبًا واسعًا بين العلماء، ونتيجه لذلك، قام عمر مكرم بثوره في يوليو 1809، وقد فشلت الثوره ونفي مكرم، حليف العلماء، الى دمياط.\nسعى محمد علي ايضا الى الحد من نفوذ شيوخ الازهر بتوزيع المناصب داخل الحكومه لاولئك الذين تلقوا تعليمهم خارج الازهر. وبعث الطلاب الى فرنسا تحديدًا، لينشئوا تحت نظام تعليمي غربي، وقام بانشاء نظام تعليمي يستند الى هذا النموذج وموازيًا اليه، وهكذا تجاوز نظام الازهر.\nواستهلت مشاريع الاشغال العامه الرئيسيه تحت حكم اسماعيل باشا، حفيد محمد علي، بهدف تحويل مدينه القاهره الى الطراز الاوروبي، في البدايه كانت هذه المشاريع مموله من مصنع القطن، لكنه استدان ديون ضخمه من البريطانيين، واصبحت تلك الديون ذريعه لبريطانيا باحتلال مصر عام 1882، بعد اجبار اسماعيل باشا على دفعها في عام 1879.\nكما شهد عهد اسماعيل باشا ايضا عوده الرعايه الملكيه الساميه الى الازهر، واستعاد اسماعيل باب الصعايده (بني لاول مره في عهد كتخدا) والمدرسه الاقبغاويه، كما واصل توفيق باشا بن اسماعيل - الذي اصبح بدوره الخديوي بعد ان اطاح بوالده نتيجه للضغط البريطاني - استعاده المسجد، وقام توفيق بتجديد قاعه الصلاه التي اضيفت في عهد كتخدا، بمحاذاه الواجهه الجنوبيه الشرقيه من القاعه والشارع الذي يقع وراءها، واعاده تشكيل عده مناطق اخرى من المسجد. ونجح ابن توفيق، عباس الثاني خديوي مصر والسودان في عام 1892، باعاده هيكله الواجهه الرئيسيه للمسجد وبنى الرواق الجديد واستمرت التجديدات التي كتبها جده اسماعيل. وتحت حكمه، واستعيدت لجنه حفظ الاثار الفنيه العربيه (شكلت في البدايه تحت الاحتلال الفرنسي)، وايضا استعاد الصحن الفاطمي الاصلي.\nكما استمرت مجموعه كبيره من الاصلاحات التي بدات في ظل حكم اسماعيل باشا في ظل الاحتلال البريطاني، ومع قدوم شيخ الازهر محمد المهدي العباسي، وضعت مجموعه من الاصلاحات تهدف الى تشكيل هئيه تدريس هيكل تعليمي لتوحيد امتحانات الطلاب في عام 1872، وقد بذل الجهد لتحديث النظام التعليمي تحت اداره حلمي خلال الاحتلال البريطاني، وجُمِعَت مخطوطات المسجد في مكتبه مركزيه، وحُسِّنَت ايضا المرافق الصحيه للطلاب، ووضع نظام للامتحانات. وفي عام 1885، وضعت كليات اخرى في مصر مباشره تحت اداره الجامع الازهر.\nوخلال فتره سعد زغلول كوزير للتعليم، قبل ان ينتقل الى قياده الثوره المصريه عام 1919، بُذلت جهود اخرى لتعديل السياسه التعليميه للازهر، وايده التيار المحافظ في سياسته، في حين لقي سعد زغلول معارضه تيارات اخرى مثل جماعه الاخوان المسلمون التي تاسست عام 1928، وقد جذبت المدرسه طلاب من جميع انحاء العالم، بما في ذلك طلاب من جنوب شرق اسيا وخاصه اندونيسيا.\nفي عهد الملك فؤاد الاول، صدر قانونان من شانهما تنظيم الهيكل التعليمي للازهر. واول هذه القوانين، في عام 1930، وينص على تقسيم المدرسه الى ثلاثه اقسام: اللغه العربيه، الشريعه، واصول الدين، وان يقع كل قسم في مبنى خارج المسجد في جميع انحاء القاهره، ويُمتحن الطلاب امتحانًا رسميًا لكسب شهاده في واحده من هذه المجالات الثلاثه من الدراسه، وبعد ست سنوات، صدر القانون الثاني الذي نقل المكتب الرئيسي للمدرسه لمبنى شُيِّد حديثًا موازيًا لشارع المسجد، واضيفت هياكل اضافيه في وقت لاحق لاستكمال ادارات المباني الثلاثه.\nكما بدات الافكار التي ينادي بها العديد من الاصلاحيين تزداد في مدخل القرن العشرين، امثال محمد عبده ومحمد الاحمدي الظواهري وغيرهم من المفكرين، واخذت هذه الافكار تترسخ في الازهر، وفي عام 1928 عُيِّن محمد مصطفى المراغي شيخًا للازهر وهو من اتباع محمد عبده. وقد عارضت الغالبيه العظمى من العلماء تعيينه، وبدات اداره المراغي وخلفائه سلسله من الاصلاحات والتحديثات التي طرات على المسجد وجامعته، وتوسيع المناهج التعليميه خارج اطار الموضوعات التقليديه. وقد كره الملك فؤاد المراغي، وقام باستبداله بعد سنه واحده من تعيينه وعين الظواهري مكانه، ولكن المراغي عاد الى منصب شيخًا للازهر في عام 1935، وظل بمركزه حتى وفاته في عام 1945. وتحت قيادته وُسِّعَت مناهج الازهر لتشمل لغات غير العربيه والعلوم الحديثه.\n\nالازهر وثوره يوليو\nفي اعقاب الثوره المصريه عام 1952، التي قامت بها حركه الضباط الاحرار بقياده محمد نجيب وجمال عبد الناصر، والتي ادت الى سقوط النظام الملكي المصري، خلال هذه الفتره تمت مراحل فصل الجامعه عن المسجد. وقد تم ضم الكثير من الممتلكات التي تحيط بالمسجد وهدمها لتوفير مساحه للحرم الحديث، وفي عام 1955، لم يعد المسجد بمثابه مدرسه، وتم انشاء كليات رسميه للجامعه في عام 1961، وفي عام 1961 صدر قانون ينص على فصل الادوار المزدوجه للمؤسسه التعليميه والمؤسسه الدينيه التي لقيت اذانا صاغيه في جميع انحاء العالم الاسلامي، ونص القانون على انشاء كليات غير دينيه داخل الازهر، مثل كليات الطب والهندسه، والاقتصاد، وتعزيز الجهود في التحديث للمره الاولى بعد الاحتلال الفرنسي، وقد ادت اصلاحات المناهج الى نمو هائل في عدد الطلاب المصريين الذين حضروا الى المدارس، وعلى وجه الخصوص الشباب الذين يحضرون المدارس الابتدائيه والمدارس الثانويه داخل منظومه الازهر، وبحسب احصائيات عدد الطلبه الذين حضروا الى مدارس الازهر الابتدائيه والمدارس الثانويه ارتفع من اقل 90,000 طالب في عام 1970 الى 300,000 طالب في اوائل الثمانينات، ثم الى ما يقرب من مليون طالب في اوائل التسعينات، وتجاوز 1.3 مليون طالب في عام 2001.\n\nوقد واصل جمال عبد الناصر خلال فتره توليه منصب رئيس الوزراء، ثم الرئيس، جهوده المبذوله للحد من سلطه علماء الازهر والى استخدام نفوذهم لمصلحته، وفي عام 1952 اُمِّمَت الاوقاف ووضعت تحت سلطه وزاره الاوقاف التي انشئت حديثًا، مما قطع من قدره المسجد للسيطره على الشؤون الماليه، والغى المحاكم الشرعيه، ودمج المحاكم الدينيه مع النظام القضائي للدوله في عام 1955، مما يحد بشده من استقلال العلماء، وفي عام 1961 صدر قانون الاصلاح، الذي ينص على ابطال قانون استقال الازهر عام 1936، واصبح لرئيس مصر سلطه تعيين شيخ الازهر، وهو موقف انشئ لاول مره اثناء الحكم العثماني.\n\nوواصل الازهر، الذي ظل رمزاً للطابع الاسلامي للامه والدوله، التاثير على السكان بينما لم يصبح قادرًا على فرض ارادته على الدوله. وتعرض الازهر بشكل متزايد الى بيروقراطيه الدوله بعد الثوره وتوقف استقلال منهجه ووظيفته كمسجد، كذلك اُضعِفت سلطه العلماء بانشاء الوكالات الحكوميه المسؤوله عن تقديم تفسيرات للقوانين الدينيه، في حين ان هذه الاصلاحات قُلِّصَت جذريا باستقلال سلطه العلماء، كما كان لها تاثير باعاده ترسيخ نفوذهم بادماجهم في جهاز الدوله، كما ينص قانون اصلاح العلماء لعام 1961، بتخصيص موارد الدوله لهم، مع ان خزينه المال كانت خارج سيطره الازهر، في حين سعى جمال عبد الناصر الى اخضاع العلماء تحت الدوله، لم يسمح بالمزيد من الاقتراحات المتطرفه للحد من نفوذ الازهر. مثل اقتراح طه حسين في عام 1955. حيث سعى حسين الى تفكيك نظام الازهر للتعليم الابتدائي والثانوي وتحويل الجامعه الى كليه للشريعه ضمن النظام التعليمي الحديث، وقد عارضه العلماء على هذه الخطه، على الرغم من ان خيار عبد الناصر للحفاظ على مركز الازهر يرجع الى اعتبارات سياسيه شخصيه، مثل استخدام الازهر بمنح الشرعيه للنظام، وتجتب معارضه العلماء.\n\nواصبح الازهر في هذه الفتره بشكل كامل كذراع للحكومه، ثم استخدم لتبرير تصرفات الحكومه. على الرغم من ان العلماء كانوا قد اصدروا في وقت سابق ان الاشتراكيه لا يمكنها ان تتوافق مع الاسلام، لكن بعد الثوره والاستصلاح الزراعي، اصدر علماء الازهر احكامًا جديده تتوافق مع عبد الناصر مع تبريرها دينيًا وسموها الاشتراكيه الاسلاميه، واصبح استخدام العلماء بمثابه قوه موازيه لجماعه الاخوان المسلمين، والحد من النفوذ الوهابي في المملكه العربيه السعوديه، والقى باللائمه في محاوله اغتيال ناصر على جماعه الاخوان المسلمين وحُظِرَت، وقد احتاج عبد الناصر الى دعم من العلماء كما انه بادر باعتقالات جماعيه من اعضاء جماعه الاخوان المسلمين،  وعلى اثره خففت بعض القيود المفروضه على الازهر. وبدورهم ايد علماء الازهر عبد الناصر في محاولاته لتفكيك جماعه الاخوان المسلمين، واستمر الحال على ذلك في الانظمه اللاحقه، وعلى الرغم من الجهود المبذوله من الازهر لتشويه سمعه الاخوان المسلمين، استمرت جماعه الاخوان المسلمين في عملها، كما قدم الازهر ايضا شرعيه للحرب مع الكيان الصهيوني في عام 1967، معلنا الجهاد ضد الكيان الصهيوني.\nبعد وفاه عبد الناصر في عام 1970، واصبح انور السادات رئيسا لمصر، وعبَّر السادات عن رغبته باستعاده الازهر كرمز للقياده المصريه في جميع انحاء العالم العربي، قائلا ان: «العالم العربي لا يمكن ان بعمل بدون مصر والازهر»، وزاد هذا الاعتراف من النفوذ المتزايد لجماعه الاخوان المسلمين، وقد خفف السادات عددا من القيود المفروضه على الاخوان والعلماء ككل. ومع ذلك، اطلقت حمله في سبتمبر 1971 من الصحفيين والمنظمات على السادات وهاجموا مواقفه بشكل مفاجئ، فوضع السادات عقوبات ضد العلماء الذين انتقدوا السياسات الرسميه للدوله. كما واصل استخدام علماء الازهر كاداه من الحكومه، مما اثار انتقادات بين عده مجموعات، بما في ذلك الجماعات الاسلاميه وغيرها الاكثر اعتدالا، اتهم شكري مصطفى علماء الازهر بتقديم الاحكام الدينيه لغرض وحيد وهو راحه الحكومه، وعندما اقدم السادات لعقد السلام مع اسرائيل، اعتبرته الغالبيه العظمى من السكان المصريين خائنًا، وقدَّم الازهر بيانًا ينص على ان الوقت قد حان لصنع السلام.\nوبعد اغتيال السادات، اصبح حسني مبارك رئيسا لمصر في عام 1981، وواصل الازهر بمنح الشرعيه الدينيه لما تمليه الحكومه، وقد اعطى نظام مبارك نتيجه ذلك الاستقلاليه الى الجامع الازهر وعلمائه، ثم اصبح جاد الحق علي جاد الحق شيخًا للازهر في الفتره من 1982 حتى وفاته في عام 1996، وقد اكد رغبته باستقلال الازهر عن الدوله كغيره من علماء الازهر، وقال جاد الحق ان الحكومه اذا رغبت من الازهر مكافحه فعاله للجماعه الاسلاميه في مصر، يجب عليها ان تعطي للازهر اكبر قدر من الاستقلاليه عن الدوله وان يكون للازهر صوتًا لا تتدخل فيه الدوله، وفي عهد مبارك، تنازل عن عدد من سلطات الدوله الى الازهر، وخلال بدايه التسعينات قُدِّمت تعديلات على قوانين الرقابه الموجوده واعطي للازهر القدره على فرض رقابه على كل المطبوعات والاعلام الالكتروني. على الرغم من ان القانون ينص على ان الازهر قد يشارك في كتابه شكوى فقط، على سبيل المثال، ارسلت النصوص التلفزيونيه بشكل روتيني الى الازهر للموافقه عليها قبل ان تُبث.\nواصل الازهر عقد مراكز عليا للسلطات الدينيه السنيه الاخرى في جميع انحاء العالم، بما ان السنيين يشكلون الاغلبيه العظمى من مجموع السكان المسلمين، وقد كان للازهر تاثير كبير على العالم الاسلامي برمته، بالاضافه الى كونه السلطه الدينيه داخل مصر، وقد طلب من الازهر استشارات للاحكام الدينيه من خارج مصر. فمثلا قبل «حرب الخليج»، طلب فهد بن عبد العزيز ملك المملكه العربيه السعوديه من شيخ الازهر بدلاً من مفتي عام المملكه العربيه السعوديه، فتوى تاذن بتمركز قوات اجنبيه داخل المملكه، على الرغم من تواجد اثنين من اقدس الاماكن الاسلاميه داخل المملكه العربيه السعوديه، وفي عام 2003 طلب وزير الداخليه الفرنسي نيكولا ساركوزي اصدار فتوى من الازهر للسماح للفتيات المسلمات بعدم ارتداء الحجاب في المدارس العامه الفرنسيه، على الرغم من وجود «المجلس الفرنسي للاسلام». وقدم شيخ الازهر بيانًا قائلا فيه انه في حين ان ارتداء الحجاب واجب اسلامي، فان المراه المسلمه في فرنسا ملزمه باحترام واتباع القوانين الفرنسيه. وقد تعرض شيخ الازهر للكثير من الانتقادات داخل مصر، واعتُبرت الفتوى تنازلًا عن المبادئ الاسلاميه لارضاء الحكومه الفرنسيه.\n\nبعد عام 2011\nلم يتاثر الازهر بالثوره المصريه التي شهدت ازاله حسني مبارك كرئيس لمصر عام 2011، واسفرت انتخابات الحكومه الطلابيه في الاشهر التي تلت الثوره في فوز ساحق لجماعه الاخوان المسلمين، بعدها اندلعت احتجاجات تطالب المجلس العسكري الحاكم لمصر باستعاده استقلال المسجد عن الدوله، وقد كُلِّف المسجد نفسه بكتابه مشروع قانون من شانه منح الازهر استقلالا اكبر من الحكومه، في غضون ذلك، حل مؤتمر نقاش في الازهر حول مستقبله ودوره الشرعي داخل الدوله، وقد ادت وجهات النظر المختلفه حول دور الازهر في المستقبل في مصر تاتي من عده احزاب، بما في ذلك المنظمات الاسلاميه الرائده مثل الاخوان المسلمين، والاصوات الليبراليه التي ترغب في رؤيه الازهر يقف كحصن ضد المتطرفين، ويامل الازهر ان يصبح مستقلاً تمامًا عن الدوله.\n\nالعماره\nالهندسه المعماريه للازهر ترتبط ارتباطًا وثيقا بتاريخ القاهره. واستخدمت فيها مواد ماخوذه من فترات متعدده من التاريخ المصري، والتي استفادت من اسلوب العماره الفاطمي في افريقيه، ثم حصل المسجد على اضافات وتوسعات من الحكام الذي تعاقبوا على مصر، فتاثرت عماره الجامع باساليب معماريه عده من داخل وخارج مصر على حد سواء، مُزجت هذه التاثيرات معًا، وظهرت معها اساليب معماريه جديده كانت مصدر الهام فيما بعد، مثل القباب التي بُنيت الفتره العثمانيه والماذن التي بناها المماليك.\nبُني المسجد في البدايه على شكل قاعه للصلاه مع خمسه ممرات وفناء مركزي متواضع، ومنذ ذلك الحين وُسِّع المسجد عده مرات مع منشات اضافيه محيطه بالمبنى الاصلي، فاضيفت العديد من الماذن من قبل المماليك، واضيفت البوابات اثناء الحكم العثماني، واستُبدل المحراب بمحراب جديد، نجت بعض الماذن والقباب الاصليه وظلت حتى الان، وبعضها اعيد بناؤها عده مرات.\n\nالعهد الفاطمي\nكان الهيكل الاصلي للجامع الازهر 280 قدمًا (85 مترًا) في الطول و227 قدمًا (69 مترًا) في العرض، ويتالف من ثلاثه اروقه معمده تقع حول فناء، وفي جهه الجنوب الشرقي من الفناء، بنيت قاعه الصلاه الاصليه على هيئه بهو معمد، مع خمسه ممرات عميقه، بقياس 260 قدمًا (79 م) في الطول و75 قدمًا (23 م) في العرض، وكان جدار القبله منحرفًا قليلاً عن الزاويه الصحيحه، واعيد استخدام الاعمده الرخاميه لدعم الاروقه الاربعه التي تؤدي لقاعه الصلاه من مواقع موجوده في اوقات مختلفه في التاريخ المصري، من العصور الفرعونيه مرورًا بالحكم الروماني وحتى الحقبه القبطيه، مما ادى الى اختلاف ارتفاعات مستوى الاعمده لاستخدامها قواعد متفاوته السماكه، كما تظهر في الجص تاثيرات من العماره العباسيه والقبطيه والبيزنطيه.\nوقد بني في النهايه ثلاث قباب، وهي سمه مشتركه بين اوائل المساجد في شمال افريقيا، ولم ينجُ ايا منها خلال التجديدات التي لحقت بالازهر، وسجل المؤرخ المقريزي انه في القبه الاصليه التي بناها الصقلي كتب فيها:\n\nوقد لقي الصقلي رعايه شرفيه من المعز، وقد عينه، «سكرتيره الخاص» ويعتبر الصقلي اول شخص يحصل على منصب سكرتير قبل ان يصبح منصب عام.\nالمحراب الاصلي، كشف عنه في عام 1933، لديه شبه قبه فوقه مع عمود من الرخام في كل جانب، وقد كانت الزخارف الجصيه المعقده سمه بارزه في المسجد، فقد كانت كل الجدران والمحراب مزينه بالنقوش، وقد كتب على المحراب مجموعتان من الايات القرانيه المدرجه في قوقعته، والتي لا تزال سليمه، اول مجموعه من الايات هي اول ثلاث ايات من سوره المؤمنون:\n\nالمجموعه الثانيه من الايات 162، 163 من سوره الانعام:\n\nهذه النقوش هي القطعه الوحيده الباقيه من الديكور التي ترجع الى العهد الفاطمي.\n\nاضيفت الساحه المركزيه المعبَّده من رخام بين 1009 و1010، واضيفت ايضا الممرات التي تحيط الفناء لها عارضه مقوسه الشكل مع نقوش جصيه. وقد بنيت الاقواس في عهد الحافظ لدين الله من الحلي والجص، وقد اعيد بناؤها في عام 1891 باستخدام نوعين من الحلي،  يظهر اعلى مركز القوس الاول ويتكون من رونديل غارق والفصوص الاربعه والعشرين. واضيفت زمره دائريه من زخارف نباتيه في عام 1893، اما الزخرفه الثانيه المستخدمه، التي هي ما بين كل قوس، تتكون من منافذ ضحله تحت غطاء مخدد تشكل سقف اعمده متشاركه، والتي تحيط بها مجموعه من الكتابات القرانيه بالخط الكوفي. اضيفت النصوص القرانيه بعد حكم الحافظ خلال الفتره الفاطميه، وتصدرت الجدران على شكل نجمه مع زينه للشرفه على ثلاث مستويات، الممر الجنوبي الشرقي من الفناء يحتوي على المدخل الرئيسي الى قاعه الصلاه. بوابه تاطير الفارسي، التي قوس مركزها لها ممر مستطيل تفتح الى قاعه الصلاه.\nرُكِّب باب خشبي جديد ومحراب خشبي جديد في عهد الحاكم بامر الله في 1009، وفي سنه 1125، شيدت قبه اضافيه في عهد الحافظ لدين الله، بالاضافه الى ذلك، فقد امر بانشاء ممر رابع حول الفناء، اما الشرفه فقد بنيت على الطرف الغربي من الصحن.\n\nالاضافات المملوكيه\nعين صلاح الدين في البدايه وزيرا من طرف اخر الخلفاء الفاطميين العاضد لدين الله الذي كان يثق بصلاح الدين، وانهارت الدوله الفاطميه خلال عهد صلاح الدين الايوبي وسلالته، وقام صلاح الدين الايوبي في مصر، بالتحالف مع الخلافه العباسيه السنيه في بغداد، ولعدم ثقته بالازهر الشيعي تاريخا، خسر المسجد مكانته اثناء فتره حكم صلاح الدين، ومع ذلك، استعاد المسجد مكانته خلال فتره المماليك الذين قاموا بسلسله من الترميمات والاضافات للمسجد، والاشراف على التوسع السريع في مناهجه التعليميه، ومن بين الترميمات التي قام بها المماليك تعديل المحراب، مع تركيب الرخام الملون لواجهته.\nوفي عام 1339، بنيت قبه ومئذنه لتغطيه المدرسه الاقبغاويه، التي تحتوي على قبر الامير اقبغا عبد الواحد، كانت في البدايه مسجدُا قائمًا بذاته ومدرسه، ثم اصبحت مدرسه متكامله ودُمجت في الجامع الازهر، اما: المدخل، وجدار القبله، والفسيفساء والزجاج في المحراب مع القبه الاصليه يرجع تاريخها الى الفتره العثمانيه.\nفي عام 1440، بنيت المدرسه الجوهريه وتحتوي على قبر الامير جوهر القنقبائي، الذي كان يشغل منصب الخازندار (المشرف على خزائن الاموال السلطانيه) اثناء حكم السلطان المملوكي الاشرف سيف الدين برسباي، وكانت ارضيه المدرسه من الرخام، والجدران تصطف مع الخزائن، وزينت المطعمه مع خشب الابنوس والعاج والصدف، وغطيت حجره القبر بواسطه قبه صغيره مزخرفه.\n\nالمدرسه الطيبرسيه\nوفي عام 1309، بنيت المدرسه الطيبرسيه، التي تحتوي على قبر الامير علاء الدين طيبرس،  وقد بنيت اصلا لتعمل كمسجد مكمل للازهر ومنذ ذلك الحين دمجت مع بقيه المسجد،  ودرست المذاهب المالكيه والشافعيه في هذه المدرسه، وتستخدم المدرسه الان للاحتفاظ بالمخطوطات من المكتبه.\nذكر المقريزي ان المدرسه كانت تستخدم فقط لدراسه المذهب الشافعي، في حين ان مؤرخا عن ابن دقماق ذكر ان واحدا من ايوانات المدرسه كان لتعاليم الشافعي حين ان الاخر كان لتعاليم المالكي.\nاعيد بناء المدرسه بالكامل في عهد عبد الرحمن كتخدا، ولم يتبق سوى الجدار الجنوبي الشرقي والمحراب وهي القطع الوحيده الاصليه الباقيه من عهد الامير علاء الدين طيبرس،  والمحراب بقياس 1.13 مترا في العرض و76 سم في العمق. وعلى كل جانب من المحراب يقف عمود من الحجر السماقي بارتفاع 2.78 متر (9.1 قدم). وتوجد فوق الاعمده رسمات مزخرفه باشكال هندسيه ملونه، واضيفت نصف قبه في اعلى المحراب داخل القوس الخارجي، ويحيط بهذا اطار خارجي مستطيل، ويعتبر هذا المحراب الاول في مصر الذي استخدم هذا النوع من الاطار،  وقد وصف المؤرخ كريزويل هذا المحراب بانه «واحده من ارقى التحف المعماريه في القاهره.»\n\nمئذنه قايتباي\nبنيت مئذنه قايتباي في عام 1483، وهي على شكل عمود اسطواني ينقسم الى جزئين مثمنين، ومئذنه قايتباي تتكون من ثلاث شرفات، تدعمها مقرنصات، وشكل سقفها معقود الهوابط الذي يوفر الانتقال السلس من سطح مستو لمنحني واحد، وسجل اول استخدام له في مصر في 1085، الجزء السفلي مثمن، زُين بلوحات عارضه مقوسه من كل جانب، مع مجموعه من ثلاثه اعمده لتفصل كل لوحه، اما المنطقه الوسطى ايضا مثمنه فصلت عن الجزء السفلي بشرفه زينت بضفر، الشرفه الثانيه تفصل هذا الجزء مع جزء اسطواني في نهايه المئذنه، وزينت باربعه اقواس. فوق هذا توجد الشرفه الثالثه، التي توجد في اعلى جزء من المئذنه.\nويعتقد ان المئذنه اقيمت في موضع مئذنه الطوب الفاطميه، التي اعيد بناؤها عده مرات. الحسابات المعاصره تشير الى ان المئذنه الفاطميه كان بها عيوب عند بنائها، ويلزم اعاده بنائها عده مرات، فقد اُعيد بناؤها تحت اشراف صدر الدين الاذرعي الدمشقي الحنفي، وهو قاضي القضاه خلال فتره حكم «السلطان بيبرس»، وقد اُعيد بناؤها مره اخرى خلال عهد برقوق في 1397، وقد بدات المئذنه تميل بزاويه خطره، واعيد بناؤها في عام 1414 بامر من تاج الدين الشاوباكي، والي ومحتسب القاهره، وبنيت مئذنه قايتباي في موقعها اليوم، كجزء من اعاده بناء مدخل المسجد في عام 1432.\n\nباب الجندي\nيقع باب الجندي (باب قايتباي) مباشره بعد فناء مدخل باب المزينين، ويؤدي بدوره الى الباحه الرئيسيه من قاعه الصلاه، وقد بني عام 1495.\n\nمئذنه الغوري\nبنيت المئذنه مزدوجه الرؤوس في عام 1509 في عهد قنصوه الغوري، وتقع على قاعده مربعه، الجزء السفلي منها مثمن، وقد قوست جوانبه الاربعه بعارضات زخرفيه، وفصل عن جوانبيه بعمودين، اما المنطقه الوسطى فصلت عن الجزء السفلي بشرفات مكعبه تدعمه مقرنصات، وهو على شكل مثمن زُيِّن بالقيشاني الازرق، ويتكون الجزء العلوي من عمودين مستطيلين مع الاقواس على شكل حدوه حصان على كل جانب منها توجد مهاوي. ويعلو الجزء العلوي مربع يحمل اثنين من الرؤوس كمثريه الشكل تحمل كل منها هلالاً نحاسيًّا.\n\nالتجديدات العثمانيه والاضافات\nقُدمت عده اضافات وترميمات خلال عهد الخلافه العثمانيه في مصر، وانجز الكثير منها تحت اشراف عبد الرحمن كتخدا الذي ضاعف تقريبا حجم المسجد، واضاف ثلاث بوابات وهي:\n\nباب المزينين، الذي اصبح المدخل الرئيسي للمسجد.\nباب الشربه.\nباب الصعايده.\nواضاف كتخدا عده اروقه، بما في ذلك واحده للطلاب المكفوفين من الازهر، كما اضاف قاعه صلاه اضافيه جنوب القاعه الفاطميه الاصليه، مع محراب اضافي، لمضاعفه مساحه قاعه الصلاه الاجماليه.\n\nباب المزينين\nهو اكبر واهم الابواب الثمانيه للجامع الازهر وهو المدخل الرئيسي للجامع، وسبب تسميته بهذا الاسم ان المزينين كانوا يجلسون امامه من اجل حلق رؤوس المجاورين، وهو نموذج للعماره العثمانيه في القاهره، ويعود الفضل لبنائه الى عبد الرحمن كتخدا عام 1753. كان يحتوي على مئذنه قائمه بذاتها خارج البوابه بناها كتخدا، وقد هدمت المئذنه قبل افتتاح شارع الازهر من قبل توفيق باشا خلال جهود التحديث التي وقعت في جميع انحاء القاهره.\n\nالتخطيط الحالي والهيكل\nالمدخل الرئيسي الحالي الى المسجد هو باب المزينين، وهو احد ابواب الازهر والذي يؤدي الى فناء من الرخام الابيض في الجهه المقابله من قاعه الصلاه الرئيسيه، الى الشمال الشرقي من باب المزينين، نجد الفناء المحيط بواجهه المدرسه الاقبغاويه؛ وفي جنوب غرب نهايه الفناء نجد المدرسه الطيبرسيه،  ومباشره عبر الفناء من مدخل باب المزينين نجد باب الجندي (بوابه قايتباي)، الذي بني عام 1495، ويقف فوق مئذنه قايتباي، ومن خلال هذه البوابه نجد موقع باحه قاعه الصلاه. وقد غير المحراب مؤخرا الى رخام عادي مواجه مع نقوش ذهبيه.\n\nشيخ الازهر\nشيخ الازهر يُسمى كذلك «الامام الاكبر» هو اعلى منصب في هيكل اداره الجامع، وقد كان النظام المتبع ان ينتخب من بين كبار العلماء، وقد انشئ منصب شيخ الجامع الازهر في عهد الحكم العثماني ليتولى رئاسه علمائه، ويشرف على شؤونه الاداريه، ويحافظ على الامن والنظام بالازهر.\nوشيوخ الازهر بالترتيب الزمني هم:\n\nالتكريم\nنظراً للقيمه الاثريه والتاريخيه للجامع الازهر، وكنوع من تسليط الضوء على احد المعالم المصريه العريقه، فقد تم تزيين وجه العمله الورقيه المصريه فئه خمسون قرشاً برسم صوره الجامع الازهر في اكثر من اصدار، بينما يحمل ظهر الورقه الحاليه صوره لتمثال رمسيس الثاني.\n\nمعرض صور\nانظر

          "content": "The Mosque of Ibn Tulun (Arabic: مسجد إبن طولون, romanized: Masjid Ibn Ṭūlūn) is a mosque in Islamic Cairo, Egypt. Built between 876 and 879 CE by its namesake, Ahmad ibn Tulun, it is the oldest well-preserved mosque in Egypt. Its design was inspired by the 9th-century mosques of Samarra in Iraq, the Abbasid capital at the time, making it an important representative of classical Abbasid architecture. It is one of the most significant monuments of Islamic architecture in Egypt.\nThe mosque consists of a large open courtyard surrounded by roofed sections that are divided into aisles by rows of pointed arches. The arches are decorated with carved stucco, though not all of the original decoration has been preserved. The mosque is surrounded by an outer enclosure, the ziyada. The minaret, which has an unusual form with an external spiral staircase, stands in this enclosure. Various additions and restorations were made after the 9th century, including an important renovation by the Mamluk sultan Lajin in 1296. The present-day fountain and domed kiosk in the center of the courtyard date from this restoration. In addition to the main mihrab (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer), the prayer hall contains several flat stucco mihrabs added in different periods. After a period of severe neglect in the 19th century, during which the building was converted to other uses, the mosque was restored in the 20th century.\n\nHistory\nConstruction and early history\nThe mosque was commissioned by Ahmad ibn Tulun, the Abbasid governor of Egypt from 868 to 884. He was able to establish himself as a de facto autonomous ruler over Egypt and parts of the Levant. In 870, he began construction on a new administrative capital, al-Qata'i. It was located a short distance to the northwest of Fustat (the first Muslim capital of Egypt and its main city) and al-'Askar (the second capital built nearby by the Abbasids).\nThe Ibn Tulun Mosque was built to serve as al-Qata'i's congregational mosque. It was the third congregational mosque to be built in what is now Cairo, after the Mosque of 'Amr and the main mosque of al-'Askar. The medieval historian al-Maqrizi states that its construction started in 876 CE, while an original inscription slab found in the mosque identifies the date of completion as Ramadan 265 AH, corresponding to April–May 879 CE. According to Balawi, a 10th-century author, the architect of the mosque was a man named al-Nasrani, a non-Muslim, possibly Christian, who had previously designed the Aqueduct of Basatin, another of Ibn Tulun's construction projects in the area.\nThe mosque was constructed on a small hill called Gebel Yashkur, \"The Hill of Thanksgiving.\" One local legend says that it is here that Noah's Ark came to rest after the Deluge, rather than at Mount Ararat. Ibn Tulun's administrative palace, the Dar al-Imara, adjoined the mosque directly on its southeastern side, behind the qibla wall. Ibn Tulun was able to enter his mosque directly from the Dar al-Imara via a doorway that can still be seen to the right of the mihrab (niche symbolizing the qibla).\nAl-Qata'i was eventually razed to the ground in 905 by the Abbasid general Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib, who was sent to retake control of Egypt. Only the mosque and the adjoining Dar al-Imara were left standing. The mosque was spared because of its religious function while the palace was re-used by the subsequent Ikhshidid governors as an administrative center. Today, the mosque is the only surviving monument of this city.\n\nLater history\nThe mosque and the palace continued to see some use during the Fatimid period (after 969) and the Fatimid caliph al-Hafiz is recorded as having ordered some construction in the mosque in 1132, though it is unclear what work was done. The original fountain (fawara) in the center of the mosque's courtyard, which had previously burned down, was rebuilt on the orders of Caliph al-'Aziz in 995. The mosque and the area around it declined further in the following century. Part of the mosque was burned during riots in 1067. Badr al-Jamali (d. 1094), the powerful Fatimid vizier, restored the mosque, as indicated by the inscription he placed above what is still the main entrance to the mosque today. Badr al-Jamali's son and successor, al-Afdal Shahinshah, added a flat stucco mihrab to one of the prayer hall's piers in 1094.\n\nBy the 12th century, the mosque was being used as a caravanserai for North African pilgrims on their way to the Hijaz. After the assassination of the Mamluk sultan Al-Ashraf Khalil (r. 1290–1293), one of the accomplices in the murder, Lajin, hid inside the mosque, by which time the building had fallen into ruin. Mamluk-era writers report that Lajin hid inside the ruins of the original minaret, spent a miserable year there, and vowed that if God saved him and allowed him to become sultan he would restore the mosque. When he later became sultan (r. 1296–1299), he fulfilled this pledge and initiated a major restoration of the mosque in 1296. Lajin's works, many of which remain today, included renovating the main mihrab's decoration, building the dome in front of it, adding a new wooden minbar (pulpit), renovating the minaret, and building the present-day fountain in the center of the courtyard and the domed structure over it.\nIn 1524, a zawiya (Sufi convent) and tomb were built next to the minaret and are mentioned by historical sources as associated with a founder named either Sheikh Sharaf al-Din al-Madini or Sheikh al-Bushi. Its ruined remains were demolished in 1943.\nAt some point during the reign of Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century, the mosque was turned into a military hospital and then a salt warehouse. A blacksmith workshop was also installed in it. In 1846, Clot Bey received permission from Muhammad Ali to convert it into a mental asylum and sometime after this it became a poorhouse. During the conversion, Clot Bey ordered some of the arches around the mosque's courtyard to be walled up, an act which was criticized as vandalism by some 19th-century writers who visited the site afterwards.\n\nAs a result of these different uses, the building deteriorated severely in the 19th century  Some of the arches of the prayer hall along the courtyard façade collapsed in 1877. The mosque continued to be neglected in this manner until 1880, when architect Julius Franz Pasha, the head of the government's Comité de Conservation des Monuments de l'Art Arabe ('Committee for the Conservation of the Monuments of Arab Art'), closed the building and evicted its inhabitants. After this, it was examined by the Comité and assessed for repairs. Damage to the ceiling, arches, and minbar were all reported, among other problems. Recommendations were made to remove the walls blocking the arches and demolish the ad hoc structures that had been constructed inside the mosque by its poor inhabitants.\n\nAfter another examination in 1890, the Comité began restoration work. Various works were undertaken over the following years, though not enough to resolve all problems. The ceiling over the prayer hall continued to progressively fall apart, along with its arches facing the courtyard. A major event was the visit of King Fuad I, who attended Friday prayers in the mosque on 3 May 1918, the first ruler of Egypt to do so since Sultan Lajin. He subsequently took an interest in the mosque's maintenance and ordered the expropriation and removal of structures encroaching on it. In the following decade, efforts continued to remove encroaching structures and clear rubble. The Comité finally reconstructed the mosque's ceiling in 1927 and in the following two years it reconstructed the damaged arches of the prayer hall. Repair works continued intermittently after this, including the reconstruction of the westernmost walls of the ziyada (outer enclosure) from 1947 to 1948.\n\nThe Comité was dissolved in 1961 and the mosque, like other Islamic-era monuments in Cairo, was neglected for a time after this. Restoration efforts were resumed in 1978 by the government's Egyptian Antiquities Organization. While the mosque did not suffer greatly from the 1992 Cairo earthquake, the top of the minaret was damaged and its integrity compromised, which elicited the installation of scaffolding to support it.\n\nThe mosque underwent a full restoration from 2002 to 2004, which cost 2.5 million US dollars. One of the significant changes to the mosque's appearance was the paving of the entire courtyard with stone, as it had previously been largely unpaved. This had the negative side effect of causing humidity to accumulate along the walls, which were then injected with a consolidant. This action and other aspects of the restoration project were questioned and criticized by some scholars of Islamic architecture, including Caroline Williams.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Ibn Tulun Mosque is the oldest mosque in Egypt to largely retain its original form. Its architectural style is closely modeled on that of the Abbasid capital of the time, Samarra, where Ibn Tulun had spent much of his early career before being sent to Egypt. As a result, the mosque is one of the best surviving examples of the Abbasid architectural style of this period, which was dominated by the influence of Samarra. The mosque is one of the largest in Egypt by area: including its outer enclosure (ziyada), it occupies 26,318 square metres (283,280 sq ft). It is built primarily out of brick, except for the minaret, which is built of stone.\n\nExterior\nAn outer enclosure, the ziyada, surrounds the mosque on three sides and provided a buffer between the prayer space and the surrounding urban environment. The mosque's minaret stands in this enclosure on the northwest side. Originally, the mosque's ziyada contained ablutions facilities, latrines, and a medical clinic. The outer walls of the ziyada were likely adjoined by shops and neighbourhood markets. In the early 20th century, any market structures that were still adjoining the outer walls were removed.\n\nThe mosque had a total of twenty-two entrances: nineteen entrances through the ziyada (with doorways in the outer wall corresponding to doorways into the mosque proper) and another three doorways in the qibla (southeastern) wall. Only one entrance is used by visitors today. Unlike in later Egyptian mosques, none of the entrances are given architectural prominence, as this was not a feature of mosque architecture in Egypt until the later Fatimid period. The outer wall of the ziyada and the outer wall of the mosque are both topped by decorative crenellations consisting of brick openwork whose form, vaguely reminiscent of linked human figures, is likely derived from the decorative motifs inside the mosque.\n\nInterior\nOn the inside, the mosque consists of a spacious central courtyard (sahn) surrounded on four sides by roofed halls or galleries (riwaqs) divided into aisles by rows of pointed arches supported on piers. On the qibla side, this roofed area forms the main prayer hall and is five aisles deep, while the other three wings around the courtyard are two aisles deep. The arches and piers are built of brick and uphold a wooden roof built with palm. The corners of the piers are rounded by engaged columns. The upper parts of the piers, between the arches, are pierced with pointed windows that have their own colonettes.\nA dikka (raised platform for muezzins and Qur'an reciters) is located between two piers in the center of the prayer hall. It most likely dates to the Mamluk period. Next to the main mihrab (the concave niche in the qibla wall) is a wooden minbar, a pulpit for the imam, consisting of a wooden staircase leading to small kiosk-like structure topped by a curving finial. The inscription on the minbar attributes it to Sultan Lajin and dates it to 1296. It is an excellent example of early Mamluk-period woodwork.\n\nDecoration and inscriptions\nThe outlines of the arches, their intrados (undersides), and the capitals of the engaged columns are covered with carved stucco decoration, although only the arches of the southwestern side still preserve most of their intrados decoration. This decoration features geometric and floral patterns. They are derived from the Abbasid style associated with Samarra in this period, particularly those known to scholars as the \"Samarra B\" and \"Samarra C\" styles. Originally, this stucco decoration would have been painted in vivid colours, but the paint has since faded away. On the courtyard façades, the windows between the arches are also flanked by decorative rosettes. \nThe 128 windows of the mosque are also outlined with similar stucco decoration and are covered by stucco grilles. The window grilles seen today have a variety of geometric designs and date from different periods and restorations. Three or four of them are still original, from Ibn Tulun's time, and feature the simplest designs. The rest, with more complex designs, are from later restorations, including at least six from the Mamluk restoration of 1296.\n\nA long inscription on a wooden frieze runs just below the ceiling around the walls of the entire mosque, although much of it has disappeared over time and the frieze is now fragmented throughout the mosque. The inscription is carved in Kufic letters and is nearly 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) long in total. It replicates verses from the Qur'an, totaling to around one fifteenth of the entire book. The inscription is unusual for its time and it makes the Ibn Tulun Mosque the oldest surviving Islamic monument to contain religious inscriptions of such length.\n\nMihrabs (prayer niches)\nThe mosque contains six mihrabs (niches symbolizing the qibla or direction of prayer) at the mosque, five of which are flat as opposed to the main niche, which is concave. The main niche is situated in the centre of the qibla wall and is the tallest of the six. It dates from the Tulunid period but was redecorated under Sultan Lajin. The carved stucco decoration around the niche still dates from the Tulunid period, as do the pairs of marble columns with Coptic-style capitals on either side of the niche. Above the niche is a wooden frieze carved with a Kufic inscription of the Shahada (Muslim declaration of faith) followed by a blessing. Above this is a panel of wood with traces of faded painted decoration. The decoration inside the niche dates from Sultan Lajin's restoration. The upper zone is made of painted wood whose decoration has deteriorated, while the lower zone is covered in marble paneling that is characteristic of Mamluk decoration. In between these two zones is a wide band of glass mosaic containing an inscription of the Shahada in Naskhi script.\nThe other mihrabs in the prayer hall, all flat instead of concave, are the following:\n\nThe same qibla wall also features a smaller stucco mihrab to the left of the main niche. Its muqarnas sculpting and Naskhi calligraphy indicate an early Mamluk origin.\nThe two mihrabs on the piers flanking the dikka are decorated in the Samarran style, with one containing a unique medallion with a star hanging from a chain. The Kufic Shahada inscriptions on both do not mention Ali and were thus made before the Shi'a Fatimids came to power.\nThe westernmost mihrab, installed by al-Afdal Shahanshah, is a replica of an original kept at Cairo's Museum of Islamic Art. It is ornately decorated in a style with influences from Persia. The Kufic inscription mentions the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir, on whose orders the niche was made, as well as the Shi'a Shahada including Ali as God's wali after declaring the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad.\nOn the pier to the left are the remains of a copy of al-Afdal's mihrab. It differs, however, by referring to Sultan Lajin instead of al-Mustansir, and a lack of Ali's name.\n\nFountain\nIn the center of the courtyard is a fountain (fisqiya) used for ablutions. It is sheltered by a square kiosk that is open through arches on all four sides, built in stone, and covered by a dome, built in brick. This dates to the restoration of Sultan Lajin in 1296, confirmed by a wooden inscription (now partially faded) in an upper corner on the outer wall of the kiosk. \nThe original Tulunid fountain of the mosque, referred to as a fawwāra, was covered by a dome resting on ten columns and surrounded by another sixteen columns. The columns were made of gilded marble. This structure burned down, most likely in the late 10th century, before it was replaced by another.\nThe present-day fountain consists of an octagonal stone basin on the floor. It was formerly surrounded by a marble floor which has since been replaced by modern pavement. The squinches inside the dome are executed in muqarnas (\"stalactite\"-style sculpting). Above the muqarnas is an inscription band carved in stucco containing part of Surah 4:43 from the Qur'an. At the apex of the dome is a circular medallion of carved stucco containing another inscription, of Surah 5:6. The outer walls of the kiosk were crowned by stepped crenellations that have disappeared.\nInside the northeastern wall, which is thicker than the others, is a small staircase that once led to a small room built on top of the wall, at the same level as the drum of the dome. This room, of unclear purpose and origin, could still be seen in 19th-century photos but was removed in the early 20th century. A sundial that once existed in the kiosk, mentioned in Sultan Lajin's inscription and recorded in the Description de l'Égypte, may have been associated with this room. This feature suggests that the room was intended for use by the timekeeper of the mosque.\n\nMinaret\nThe minaret is unusual in form. It consists of a rectangular (cuboid) shaft at the base, followed by a cylindrical section. An external staircase wraps around both sections in a spiral fashion. The shaft is crowned by a lantern-like summit, sometimes described as a mabkhara, with a ribbed dome. The tower is connected to the wall of the mosque by a bridge with horseshoe arches.\nThere is scholarly controversy over the construction date of the minaret. Historical records attest that the original minaret built under Ibn Tulun had an external staircase, which recalls the design of the helicoidal or spiral minarets in Abbasid Samarra (such as the Malwiya). The minarets of Samarra were thus probably the inspiration for its design. At least one historical source, Ibn Duqmaq, claimed that the staircase was wide enough to accommodate two camels. Legend has it that Ibn Tulun himself was accidentally responsible for the design of the structure: supposedly while sitting with his officials, he absentmindedly wound a piece of parchment around his finger. When someone asked him what he was doing, he responded, embarrassed, that he was designing his minaret. Architectural historian Tarek Swelim argues that the original minaret was probably aligned with the central axis of the building, like other Abbasid minarets from the 9th century, instead of the current tower's location.\n\nMany of the architectural features in the current structure, however, point to a later construction. The design of the minaret's top level, in the characteristic mabkhara-style, is of early Mamluk style, while the horseshoe arches and corbels look to be of 13th-century Andalusi inspiration. The fact that it is built of stone instead of brick is inconsistent with the rest of the mosque. Moreover, the minaret does not connect well with the main mosque structure, something that would have been averted had the minaret and mosque been built at the same time.\nArchitectural historians have drawn varying conclusions. K. A. C. Creswell argued that the entire structure of the present minaret is a reconstruction by Mamluk sultan Lajin from the 1296 restoration and that it was inspired by the original Tulunid spiral minaret. Jonathan Bloom suggests that the original minaret may have disappeared by the second half of the 12th century and that it was rebuilt in the late 12th or early 13th century. Doris Behrens-Abouseif argues that the structure instead shows evidence of multiple construction phases and that the original Tulunid minaret mostly survived but was then restored by Sultan Lajin, who added some of the present-day elements. She notes that the main shaft does not resemble any Mamluk-era minarets and that this would be unlikely if Lajin had rebuilt it completely. She also points out that one 10th-century source, al-Muqaddasi, states that the Tulunid minaret was indeed built of stone and notes that no sources mention its demolition or disappearance. Tarek Swelim suggests that the original minaret was damaged and at some point was replaced by a minaret with the present-day rectangular base, built next to the original. He suggests that the circular portion of the shaft was perhaps added during the Ayyubid period (late 12th to early 13th centuries) and then the top level was added by Lajin.\nHistorical sources and early 19th-century illustrations indicate that the minaret was previously topped by an unusual copper finial in the shape of a boat. This finial was possibly replaced by a similar one at some point before the 1840s but it must have disappeared sometime between 1800, when it was last noted, and 1892, when it was replaced by a crescent-shaped finial.\n\nAdjacent structures\nAt the southwestern corner of the mosque, standing within the ziyada, is a sabil-maktab or sabil-kuttab (structure combining a sabil and maktab). This structure has been attributed to either Sultan Lajin in 1296 or to Sultan Qaytbay between 1462 and 1482. Tarek Swelim suggests that it was most likely built first by Lajin and then restored by Qaytbay. \nAt the southeastern corner of the mosque, located outside the ziyada and on the site of the former Dar al-Imara, is a pair of historic mansions, connected by a bridge, which became known as Bayt al-Kritliya. They were built in the 16th and 17th centuries. The complex now serves as the Gayer-Anderson Museum. Another structure outside the ziyada, adjoining its outer wall on the northwest side, is the Madrasa of Amir Sarghatmish, built around 1350.\n\nIn popular culture\nParts of the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me were filmed at the mosque. The mosque is featured in the game Serious Sam 3: BFE, forming a significant part of the game's third level. It is also featured in a level of Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation.\n\nThe front of the Egyptian five-pound banknote has been adorned with an illustration of the Ibn Tulun Mosque in multiple editions. Meanwhile, the back of the current banknote features an image of a Pharaonic painting.\n\nSee also\nIslam in Egypt\nList of mosques in Cairo\nList of mosques in Egypt\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\nBehrens-Abouseif, Doris (1989).

          "summary": "The Mosque of Ibn Tulun (Arabic: مسجد إبن طولون, romanized: Masjid Ibn Ṭūlūn) is a mosque in Islamic Cairo, Egypt. Built between 876 and 879 CE by its namesake, Ahmad ibn Tulun, it is the oldest well-preserved mosque in Egypt. Its design was inspired by the 9th-century mosques of Samarra in Iraq, the Abbasid capital at the time, making it an important representative of classical Abbasid architecture. It is one of the most significant monuments of Islamic architecture in Egypt.\nThe mosque consists of a large open courtyard surrounded by roofed sections that are divided into aisles by rows of pointed arches. The arches are decorated with carved stucco, though not all of the original decoration has been preserved. The mosque is surrounded by an outer enclosure, the ziyada. The minaret, which has an unusual form with an external spiral staircase, stands in this enclosure. Various additions and restorations were made after the 9th century, including an important renovation by the Mamluk sultan Lajin in 1296. The present-day fountain and domed kiosk in the center of the courtyard date from this restoration. In addition to the main mihrab (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer), the prayer hall contains several flat stucco mihrabs added in different periods. After a period of severe neglect in the 19th century, during which the building was converted to other uses, the mosque was restored in the 20th century.",

          "content": "مسجد ابن طولون او مسجد احمد بن طولون او المسجد الطولوني هو احد المساجد الاثريّه الشهيره بالقاهره. امر ببناؤه احمد بن طولون مؤسس الدوله الطولونيه سنه 263هـ/877م بمدينته الجديده القطائع ليصبح ثالث مسجد جامع بني في عاصمه مصر الاسلاميه بعد جامع عمرو بن العاص الذي بني في الفسطاط، وجامع العسكر الذي بني في مدينه العسكر ورغم ان مسجد عمرو بن العاص لا يزال موجودًا الا ان المسجد الطولوني يعد اقدم مساجد مصر القائمه حتى الان لاحتفاظه بحالته الاصليه بالمقارنه مع مسجد عمرو بن العاص الذي توالت عليه الاصلاحات التي غيرت معالمه.\nشُيد المسجد فوق ربوه صخريه كانت تعرف بجبل يشكر، ويُعتبر من المساجد المعلقه، وهو احد اكبر مساجد مصر حيث تبلغ مساحته مع الزيادات الخارجيه حوالي سته افدنه ونصف الفدان، وقد بُني على شكل مربع مستلهمًا من طرز المساجد العباسيه وخاصه مسجد سامراء بالعراق الذي استلهم منه المناره الملويه. يقع المسجد حاليًا بميدان احمد بن طولون بحي السيده زينب التابع للمنطقه الجنوبيه بالقاهره، ويجاور سوره الغربي مسجد صرغتمش الناصري فيما يجاور سوره الشرقي متحف جاير اندرسون.\n\nالمنشئ\nمنشئ المسجد هو احمد بن طولون مؤسس الدوله الطولونيه في مصر والشام، تعود اصوله الى قبيله التغزغز التركيه، وكانت اُسرته تقيم في بخاري. كان والده «طولون» مملوكًا لنوح بن اسد الساماني عامل بخارى وخراسان، فارسله هديه الى الخليفه المامون مع من اُرسل من المماليك الترك سنه 200هـ/816م. واسم طولون مشتق من كلمه تركيه (بالتركيه: Tolun) معناها البدر الكامل. انجب طولون عددًا من الابناء من بينهم احمد الذي يكنى بابي العباس سنه 220هـ/835م وولد في بغداد بالعراق من جاريه تدعى قاسم، فنشا مختلفًا عن اقرانه من اولاد العجم، حريصًا على الابتعاد عن جو العبث واللهو والمنكرات، واشتهر بالتقوى والصلاح والشده والقوه والباس. ارسله الوزير عبيد الله بن يحيى بن خاقان الى ثغر طرسوس فقضى فيه عده سنوات اخذ خلالها العلم والحديث والاداب عن كبار العلماء. بدا بزوغ نجم احمد بن طولون عندما كان في العشرين من عمره بعد وفاه والده سنه 240هـ/854م، حيث فوض اليه الخليفه العباسي المتوكل ما كان لابيه من الاعمال العسكريه.\n\nبعد مقتل الخليفه المستعين وتوليه المعتز، وُلي بايكباك التركي على مصر ولكن لرغبته في البقاء قريبًا من عاصمه الخلافه اناب احمد بن طولون عنه في امور الحكم لما عرف عنه من رجاحه العقل وحسن السيره ولقرابته منه، فدخل ابن طولون مصر سنه 254هـ/868م. ورغم وشاه مراكز القوى في مصر التي كانت توزع عليها سلطه الحكم باحمد بن طولون عند الخليفه، الا انه ظل في سده الحكم باستخدام سياسه بذل المال لاولي الامر في بغداد، كما كان يدعمه حلفاؤه من القاده الترك المُهيمنين على مقدرات الخلافه مثل بايكباك ويارجوخ. بدا احمد بن طولون في تدعيم اواصل حكمه في مصر، فتخلص من بعض اعدائه واضعف البعض الاخر وكان على راسهم ابن المدبر وشقير الحاجب، وساعدته الظروف السياسيه في بغداد على الوصول الى مراده حيث قتل بايكباك سنه 256هـ/870م وخلفه يارجوخ واليًا على مصر، الذي اناب بدوره ابن طولون على الحكم، ولما توفي يارجوخ سنه 259هـ/873م، ولى الخليفه المعتمد ابن طولون حكم مصر، وفي سنه 263هـ/877م قلده المعتمد امر خراج مصر وامره الثغور الشَاميه، فاضحى السيد الاوحد للديار المصريه والمشرف على جميع امورها، وقام بِضرب الدينار الاحمدي رمزًا لهذا الاستقلال، وامتدت حدود دولته من ليبيا الى حدود الدوله البيزنطيه في اسيا الصغرى، ومن نهر الفرات الى شلال النيل الاول. كان ابن طولون رجل دوله من الطراز الاول ذو كفاءه اداريه وعسكريه، فعني بشئون دولته ووضع اسس تحويلها الى دوله قويه، وشملت اصلاحاته سائر شئون الدوله المختلفه، فبنى مدينه القطائع وشيد القصور والمستشفيات والملاجئ وقناطر المياه، وشجع الزراعه واصلح السدود والترع والقنوات، وحفر الجديد منها، وحمى الفلاحين من ظلم جباه الضرائب واصلح مقياس النيل بالروضه. كما ازدهرت في عهده الصناعه، فاشتهرت مصر بصناعه النسيج. وانشا كذلك مسجده المعروف الذي لا يزال شاهدًا على ازدهار عصر بانيه. ادى نجاحه في اداره شئون البلاد الى انتشار الرخاء والعمار والعدل بين الرعيه. وتوفي احمد بن طولون سنه 270هـ/884م وخلفه على الحكم ابنه خمارويه ودفن بمدافن الطولونيين بالقرافه الصغرى بالقرب من بابها بسفح المقطم.\n\nالمهندس\nاختلف المؤرخون حول شخصيه مهندس المسجد، فرجح بعضهم انه كان نصرانيًا يدعى سعيد بن كاتب الفرغاني، وانه كان مهندس عينًا للماء طلب بنائها ابن طولون فلما اتمها دعا ابن طولون لزيارتها ولسوء حظه كان بموضع البناء جيرًا لا زال رطبًا غاصت به قدم فرس ابن طولون فكبا به فظن انه اراد به سوءًا، فامر بجلده وسجنه، وظل بمحبسه حتى اراد ابن طولون بناء الجامع فقُدر له ثلاثمائه عمود صعب تدبيرها الا عبر استخدام اعمده الكنائس والاديره المتخربه، فتورع ابن طولون عن ذلك، ولما بلغ النصراني في محبسه الخبر كتب لابن طولون انه يبنيه له كما يحب ويختار بلا اعمده الا عمودي القبله، فاخرجه ابن طولون واحضر له جلودًا للرسم، فصور له النصراني المسجد فاُعجب به واستحسنه، واطلق سراحه وخلع عليه ورصد له مائه الف دينار لنفقه البناء وكل ما يحتاج بعد ذلك، فوضع النصراني يده في البناء في موضع جبل يشكر، فلما اتم البناء وراح ابن طولون لزياره المسجد، صعد النصراني الى المناره صائحًا بابن طولون بطلب الجائزه والامان خوفًا من ان يجري له ما جرى في المره الاولى، فامنه ابن طولون وكافاه بعشره الاف دينار وخلع عليه واجرى له رزقاً واسعاً. اما المجموعه الاخرى من المؤرخين فيرجحون ان المهندس لم يكن نصرانياً بل كان عراقيًا بسبب تاثر مصمم المسجد بتصميم مسجد سامراء بالعراق، وعدم استخدام الاساطين او الاعمده الرخاميه في البناء بل استُخدم بدلًا من ذلك العقود القائمه على دعائم من الاجر. ورجح بعضهم ان المهندس هو احمد بن محمد الحاسب الذي قدم من العراق لبناء مقياس النيل الجديد بالروضه.\n\nالتاريخ\nلما اسس احمد بن طولون مدينته القطائع سنه 256هـ/870م كي تكون مدينه خاصه به وبحاشيته وجنده، بعد ان ضاقت عليهم الفسطاط والعسكر، وكرمز لاستقلاله عن الدوله العباسيه، وكما كان معهودًا في ذلك الوقت بان المسجد الجامع هو مركز العواصم الاسلاميه، فقد شيد بن طولون مسجده الضخم بالقطائع، وذُكر ان من اسباب بناء الجامع هو ضيق جامع مدينه العسكر بالمصلين، فبدئ في بناء المسجد سنه 263هـ/877م وانتهى البناء في سنه 265هـ/879م، ورصد لبناء المسجد مائه الف دينار ولكن بلغت تكلفته عند الانتهاء منه مائه وعشرون الف دينار كان مصدرها كنز عثر عليه بن طولون في الجبل.\nلما اُتمت عماره المسجد نُقل اليه القراء والفقهاء وصلى فيه القاضي بكار بن قتيبه، ودرس فيه الربيع بن سليمان حديث «من بنى لله مسجدً ولو كمفحص قطاه بنى الله له بيتًا في الجنه»، وتصدق بن طولون بصدقات عظيمه واطعم الفقراء والمساكين، وقد تقرب الناس بالصلاه فيه والزم اولادهم صلاه الجمعه في فواره الجامع ثم يخرجون بعد الصلاه الى مجلس الربيع بن سليمان ليكتبوا العلم ومع كل واحد وراق وعده غلمان. وعرف الجامع في القرن الرابع الهجري/العاشر الميلادي بـ«الجامع الفوقاني»، تمييزًا له عن «الجامع السفلاني» وهو جامع عمرو بن العاص في الفسطاط.\nلما فشلت مؤامره قتل السلطان الاشرف خليل بن قلاوون، التي شارك الامير حسام الدين لاجين في تدبيرها، هرب لاجين ولوحق فتخفى بالمسجد، ونذر الى الله ان نجا من هذه المحنه ان يعمرن المسجد، فتحقق مراده وجلس على عرش مصر، فابر بنذره واكمل اصلاح المسجد من كل وجه سنه 696هـ/1296م، ورتب فيه دروسًا للفقه على المذاهب الاربعه، ودرسًا في تفسير القران الكريم، ودرسًا في الحديث النبوي، ودرسًا في الطب، ورتب للمسجد خطيبًا ومؤذنين وفراشين وقرر لهم رواتب، وعمل بجواره مكتبًا لاقراء ايتام المسلمين القران الكريم، ومنذ اجراء تلك التجديدات اصبح يلي نظاره المسجد قاضي القضاه، وكان اول من ولي نظارته قاضي القضاه بدر الدين بن جماعه. وفي سنه 767هـ جدد الامير يلبغا الخاصكي العمري درسًا بالمسجد فيه سبعه مدرسين للحنفيه، وقرر لكل فقيه من الطلبه في الشهر اربعين درهماً واردب قمح.\n\nقصص حول المسجد\nلما امعن احمد بن طولون في الصحراء غاصت قدم فرس احمد غلمانه في الرمال فسقط الغلام فوقف بن طولون ونظر فوجد فتق مكان قدم الفرس ففتح فاصاب فيه من المال ما بلغ مقداره الف الف دينار وهو ما سمي «المطلب» الذي شاع خبره، وكتب به الى الخليفه المعتمد في بغداد يستاذنه فيما يصرفه فيه من وجوه البر، فبنى منه «البيمارستان»، ثم اًصاب بعده في الجبل مالًا عظيمًا «الكنز» فبنى منه الجامع، واوقف جميع ما بقي من المال في الصدقات.\nلما مر احمد بن طولون على المسجد اثناء بنائه في رمضان، فراي العمال يشتغلون الى وقت الغروب، فسال متى يشتري هؤلاء الضعفاء افطار لاولادهم، وامر بصرفهم وقت العصر، فاتخذ هذا سنه من وقتها.\nلما اتم بناء المسجد راى احمد بن طولون في منامه كان الله تعالى قد تجلى للقصور التي حول المسجد ولم يتجلى للمسجد، فسال المعبرين، فقالوا: يخرب ما حوله ويبقى قائمًا وحده، فقال: من اين لكم هذا، قالوا: من قوله تعالى: ﴿فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّى رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُ دَكًَّا﴾ [الاعراف:143]، وقوله صلى الله عليه وسلم: اذا تجلى الله لشئ خضع له.\nلما فرغ احمد بن طولون من بناء المسجد امر حاشيته بسماع ما يقول الناس فيه من الاقوال والعيوب، فقال رجل: محرابه صغير، وقال اخر: ما فيه عمود، وقال اخر: ليست له ميضاه، فبلغه ذلك فجمع الناس وقال: اما المحراب فاني رايت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وقد خطه لي في منامي، واصبحت فرايت النمل قد طافت بذلك المكان الذي خطه لي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، واما العمد فاني بنيت هذا الجامع من مال حلال وهو الكنز، وما كنت لاشوبه بغيره، وهذه العمد اما ان تكون في مسجد او كنيسه فنزهته عنها، واما الميضاه فاني نظرت فوجدت ما يكون بها من النجاسات فطهرته عنها، وها انا ابنيها خلفه وامر ببنائها.\nلما فرغ احمد بن طولون من بناء الجامع راى في منامه كان ناراً نزلت من السماء فاخذت الجامع دون ما حوله من العمران، فلما اصبح قص رؤياه فقيل له: ابشر بقبول الجامع المبارك لان النار كانت في الزمن الماضي، اذا قبل الله قرباناً نزلت نار من السماء اخذته.\nلما رقي الخطيب ابو يعقوب البلخي المنبر وخطب، دعا للمعتمد ولولده ونسي ان يدعو لابن طولون ونزل عن المنبر، فاشار الامير الى غلامه نسيم بضرب الخطيب خمسمائه سوط، فتذكر الخطيب سهوه وهو على مراقي المنبر فعاد وقال: الحمد لله وصلى الله على سيدنا محمد ولقد عهدنا الى بني ادم من قبل فنسى ولم نجد له عزما، اللهم واصلح الامير ابا العباس احمد بن طولون مولى امير المؤمنين، وزاد في الشكر والدعاء له بقدر الخطبه ثم نزل، فنظر الامير الى الغلام باستبدال الاسواط بالدنانير، ووقف الخطيب على ما كان منه فحمد الله تعالى على سلامته وهناه الناس.\nلما انتهى الجامع وفتح للصلاه لم يحضر احد من المصلين لاعتقادهم انه بني بمال لا يعرفون اصله وكان الناس في ذلك الوقت محترزين على دينهم، فعز ذلك على ابن طولون وجمعهم في يوم جمعه وخطب فيهم واقسم بالله العظيم الذي لا اله الا هو انه ما بنى هذا الجامع «ويده تشير اليه» بشيء من ماله وانه بناه بكنز ظفر به في الجبل الثالث، وان العشارى الذي نصبه على مئذنته وجده في الكنز، واكمل الخطبه، فلما سمع الناس ذلك اجتمع خلق كثير وصلوا فيه الجمعه ولما سمع الناس حكايه المحراب الذي خطه النمل عظم ذلك عندهم حتى ضاق بالمصلين فقالوا لابن طولون نريد ان تزيد لنا فيه زياده، فزاد فيه ما يعرف حالياً بالزيادات.\n\nالتصميم\nيعتبر المسجد من المساجد المعلقه اذ يصعد الى ابوابه الداخليه بدرجات دائريه، وهو من اكبر مساجد مصر حيث تبلغ مساحته مع الزيادات سته افدنه ونصف الفدان، استخدم في بنائه الطوب الاحمر، واقيم على جبل يشكر، فكان اساسه في حدوده القبليه على صخر الجبل مباشره، اما في حدوده البحريه فكانت اساساته على عمق خمسه امتار. وضع تصميمه على مثال المساجد الجامعه التي لها صحن كبير مكشوف تحيط به اروقه ذات عقود. وبني المسجد على شكل مربع تقريباً طول ضلعه 162.25 متر × 161.50 متر، يشغل منها المسجد مع جدرانه مستطيلاً طول ضلعه 137.80 متر × 118.10 متر، ويتوسطه صحن مكشوف مربع تقريباً طول ضلعه 92.35 متر × 91.80 متر، ويحيط بالجامع من جوانبه القبليه والبحريه والغربيه اروقه غير مسقوفه تعرف بالزيادات وهي من المسجد، واسوار هذه الزيادات عاليه بسيطه، فتحت بها ابواب تقابل ابواب الجامع، تتوجها من اعلى شرفه مفرغه، كما فتحت باسوار الجامع ابواب وشبابيك علويه، بينها حنايا وطاقات مخوصه تتوجها من اعلى شرفات. وللمسجد 21 باب يقابلها نفس العدد في الزيادات، ويوجد في بعض الابواب معابر خشبيه قديمه بها زخارف مورقه، وسبب تعدد الابواب كان لتسهيل الوصول الى المساكن والاسواق التي كانت حول الجامع.\nبعد تجاوز سور الزياده وابواب المسجد يُوصل الى الايوانات التي يتوسطها صحن كبير، يمثل الايوان الشرقي ايوان القبله وهو اكبر الايوانات واكثرها اروقه وزخرفه، حيث يشتمل على خمسه اروقه، فيما تشتمل باقي الايوانات على رواقين، وبه اللوحه التاسيسيه للمسجد التي تتضمن تاريخ انشاؤه، ويتوسط جداره الشرقي المحراب الرئيسي، وهيكله طولوني، اما الفسيفساء والطاقيه الخشب ومقرنص القبه اعلاه فهي من اعمال السلطان لاجين، الذي تنضم الى اعماله ايضاً المنبر الخشبي الذي اتُخذت حشواته من خشب الساج الهندي والابنوس المدقوق بنقوش مورقه في منتهى الدقه، ونقل لاجين المنبر القديم الى الجامع الظاهري الذي تلاشى حالياً ولم يبق له اثر. وبالاضافه الى المحراب الرئيسي بهذا الايوان توجد خمس محاريب جصيه غير مجوفه اخرى استجدت بعد ذلك، اثنان صغيران احدهما على يمين دكه المبلغ والاخر على يسارها، والمحراب المستنصري الموجود في منتصف البائكه الثانيه بالرواق الشرقي من جهه الصحن، وعلى يساره محراب السلطان لاجين، ومحراب يعود الى عصر المماليك البحريه على يسار المحراب الرئيسي. والاروقه مكونه من دعائم مبنيه بالطوب مخلق في نواصيها الاربع عمد وتيجان تحمل عقوداً ستينيه حليت حافاتها بزخارف جصيه نباتيه وفتح فيها شبابيك حليت بزخارف متنوعه، ويعلو العقود افريز زخرفي من الجص يعلوه ازار خشبي يحيط باروقه المسجد مكتوب فيه بالخط الكوفي البارز سورتا البقره وال عمران. وكان لاختيار الدعائم بدلاً من العمد دليلاً على حسن ذوق المصمم لتماثلها في الطول والسمك وهو ما لا ينطبق على العمد الرخاميه التي كانت تختلس عاده من من الكنائس والاديره المتخربه. استعمل الاسمنت المسلح بالسقوف الاثريه لاول مره في هذا المسجد، وكان ذلك على يد محمود باشا احمد مدير اداره حفظ الاثار العربيه فبنى السقف بتقاسيمه القديمه من الاسمنت المسلح ثم غلفه بالاخشاب القديمه والجديده المطابقه للقديم. ويحيط بجدران المسجد الاربعه من اعلى مائه وتسعه وعشرون شباكاً من الجص المفرغ باشكال هندسيه ونباتيه.\nوالقبه وسط الصحن هي ثالث قبه اقيمت للمسجد، حيث احترقت القبه الاولى الطولونيه للصحن سنه 376هـ/986م، وتهدمت الثانيه التي انشئها العزيز بالله وقيل امه تغريد سنه 385هـ/995م، وحلت محلها القبه الموجوده حالياً وهي من ضمن اعمال السلطان لاجين بالمسجد وانشئها سنه 696هـ/1296م، وهي قبه كبيره يقاس كل من ضلعيها القبلي والبحري 12.75 متر وضلعيها الشرقي والغربي 14.10 متر، وهي محموله على اربعه عقود كانت شبابيكها محلاه بزخارف وكتابات كوفيه، وبرقبتها من الداخل كتبت ايه الوضوء، ويتوسطها فسقيه، وفي جدارها سلم يوصل الى سطح قاعدتها المربعه. اقيمت المناره على مسافه 0.40 سم من حائط الزياده الغربيه وهي مبنيه بالحجر مقاس قاعدتها 12.78 متر × 13.65 متر، وهي مكونه من اربع طبقات الاولى مربعه والثانيه مستديره وهي التي بها السلم الحلزوني والثالثه مثمنه اما الرابعه فتعلوها طاقيه تكون معها شكل مبخره. وهي المناره الوحيده في مصر التي لها سلم خارجي يشبه مناره مسجد سامراء. وتاريخ انشاء المناره محل خلاف بين الاثريين حيث يرى بعضهم ان السلطان لاجين جددها كامله سنه 696هـ/1296م على مثالها القديم ضمن اعماله بالمسجد، ويرى البعض الاخر انها طولونيه عدا قمتها التي جددها السلطان لاجين.\nاما القبه فوق المحراب فهي مكونه من قاعده مربعه من الخارج تحتوي على مجموعه من المقرنصات مكسوه بالخشب لتحويل المربع الى شكل مثمن ثم الى الدائره التي ترتكز عليها القبه، وتلك القبه من اعمال السلطان لاجين بالمسجد. الحق بالمسجد سبيل يقع بالناحيه الشرقيه من الزياده الجنوبيه له واجهه رئيسه هي الغربيه يبلغ طولها 19.80 متر وتنقسم الى جزاين الاول يضم باب الدخول والثاني يضم شباك السبيل، وحجره التسبيل مستطيله المسقط طولها من الشرق الى الغرب 11.75 متر وعرضها 5.35 متر، ويغطي حجره السبيل سقف من براطيم خشبيه عليه اثار زخارف نباتيه ملونه وباركانه اربع مقرنصات يتكون كل منها من سبع حطات متتاليه. وبجوار المحراب الرئيسي باب في الجهه الجنوبيه الشرقيه كان يخرج ويدخل منه ابن طولون الى دار الاماره الملاصقه للمسجد ليغير ثيابه او يجدد وضوئه او لاخذ قسط من الراحه ثم يعود فيدخل الى الصف الاول دون ان يتخطى جموع المصلين، ودمرت هذه الدار مع الدمار الذي حل بمدينه القطائع بعد زوال الدوله الطولونيه، والدار القائمه اليوم مكانها هي من اعمال السلطان لاجين.\n\nنص التاسيس\nنص التاسيس على واجهه مدخل الباب\n\nالترميم\nتوالت يد الاصلاح والترميم على المسجد في اكثر من مناسبه كان منها في عهد الخليفه الحاكم بامر الله الذي انزل الى المسجد ثمانمائه واربعه عشر مصحفاُ. وكان في وسط صحن المسجد فسقيه من الرخام تعلوها قبه مثمنه الشكل مذهبه ومحموله على اعمده من رخام، تعرضت سنه 376هـ/986م في عهد الخليفه الفاطمي العزيز بالله لحريق، فاقام بدلاً منها قبه اخرى سنه 385هـ/995م، ولكن هذا التجديد لم يقو ايضاً على مواجهه عوامل الزمن. وخلال خلافه المستنصر بالله سنه 470هـ/1077م اجتاح مصر الوباء والقحط، فنشعت جدران المسجد والم به الخراب، فلحقه الوزير بدر الدين الجمالي سنه 470هـ/1077م واصلح اركانه وقوم بنيانه. وفي سنه 526هـ/1131م امر الخليفه الحافظ لدين الله ببعض اصلاحات بالمسجد. وفي عهد صلاح الدين الايوبي اختص المسجد بفريق من المغاربه استعمره اكثر من جيل، الى ان تولى حكم مصر السلطان الظاهر بيبرس فاتخذ ملحقات المسجد شونه للغلال سنه 662هـ/1263م. ثم كانت اصلاحات السلطان حسام الدين لاجين سنه 696هـ/1296م التي شملت بناؤه للسبيل الموجود بالنصف الشرقي من الزياده القبليه والذي جدده السلطان قايتباي فيما بعد، وانشاؤه القبه القائمه اليوم على فسقيه بوسط الصحن والتي لها سلم يؤدي الى ظهرها عمل في جدار قاعدتها البحري بدلاً من بناؤه منفصلاً، وتجديده كذلك الجزء العلوي المضلع من المئذنه الكبرى الذي يعلو دورتها المستديره، وتشييده للمنبر الحالي. وفي عهد الناصر محمد بن قلاوون انشا بالمسجد منارتين اسطوانيتين على طرفي جداره الشرقي بناهما بالطوب، هدمت الاولى في القرن الثالث عشر الهجري، والثانيه البحريه الشرقيه في سنه 1933 لخلل بهما. وفي عهد الظاهر برقوق انشا الحاج عبيد بن محمد البازدار سنه 792هـ/1390م رواقاً بجوار المئذنه الكبرى، وجدد ميضاه بجانب الميضاه القديمه، ثم تلاه الشيخ شرف الدين المدني فانشا مصلى وتربه سنه 930هـ/1534م، وقد زالت انشاءات البازدار والمدني في عماره سور الزياده الغربيه سنه 1943. وفي ايام محمد بك ابى الذهب انشا بالمسجد مصنعاً لعمل الاحرمه الصوفيه. وفي سنه 1263هـ/1847م حول كلوت بك المسجد الى ملجا للعجزه، وظل كذلك حتى سنه 1882 حين ادركت لجنه حفظ الاثار العربيه المسجد فوجهت اليه عنايتها وقامت خلال الفتره من 1890 وحتى 1918 بازاله الابنيه المستحدثه التي كانت بداخل الايوانات، وهدمت بعض الدور التي كانت تحجب الوجهه الشرقيه للمسجد، وازالت الاتربه والانقاض، واصلحت القبه التي فوق المحراب والمناره الكبيره والمناره البحريه الشرقيه والمنبر والشبابيك الجصيه وجزء من السقف، وحافظت على الزخارف الجصيه.\nوفي عهد الملك فؤاد الاول سنه 1918 رغب في اعاده اقامه الشعائر الدينيه بالمسجد فصلى فيه فريضه الجمعه وامر بتخليه جوانبه وتتميم اصلاحه، فقامت اللجنه بتخليه الوجهه البحريه وفتح ابوابها، واصلاح اسوارها وازالت الابنيه المحدثه بالزياده القبليه، واخلت قسم كبير من الوجهتين الشرقيه والغربيه، وبلطت اروقه الايوانات الغربيه والبحريه والقبليه، واصلحت الزخارف الجصيه بباطن العقود، والسبيل الموجود بالزياده القبليه، وازالت الاتربه من الزيادات ومهدتها ومعها والصحن، واعادت بناء الرواق المشرف على الصحن من الايوان الشرقي، كما عملت لجميع الاروقه سقف من الاسمنت المسلح برسم السقف القديم وغلفته باخشاب ادخلت فيها الاجزاء القديمه، واعادت تركيب الازار الكوفي فيها، وبلغت تكلفه تلك الاصلاحات 40 الف جنيه، كما بلغت تكلفه نزع الملكيه 45 الف جنيه. وفي عهد الملك فاروق الاول اُصلح كثير من الشبابيك الجصيه كما اصلح المحراب المستنصري ونزعت ملكيه بعض الدور التي تلاصق الزياده الغربيه بجوار المناره الكبيره وكذلك بقيه الدور التي تحجب الوجهتين الشرقيه والقبليه. اما اخر محاولات ترميم المسجد فكانت في عام 2005 حين قامت وزاره الثقافه المصريه بترميم زخارفه وافتتاحه كواحد من بين 38 مسجداً تم ترميمها ضمن مشروع القاهره التاريخي، وقد اعلنت وزاره الثقافه ان اعاده

          "content": "The Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan (Arabic: مسجد ومدرسة السلطان حسن) is a monumental mosque and madrasa located in Salah al-Din Square in the historic district of Cairo, Egypt. It was built between 1356 and 1363 CE during the Bahri Mamluk period, commissioned by Sultan an-Nasir Hasan. The mosque was considered remarkable for its massive size and innovative architectural components, and is still considered one of the most impressive historic monuments in Cairo today.\n\nHistory\nPatron and founder: Sultan Hasan\nSultan al-Nasir Hasan (full name: An-Nasir Badr ad-Din Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Qalawun) ascended the throne at the age of 13 in 748 AH (1347/1348 CE). When he reached maturity in 1350, he arrested the Emir Manjaq who controlled all of the state's affairs. Prior to that arrest, the emir was restricted to an allowance of just one hundred dirham per day. This pocket change was collected by servants for the Sultan. It's especially striking considering that during that time, the emir Shaykhu was estimated to have an income of 200,000 dirham per day. This deprivation may be viewed as a prompt for his later extravagance. Upon taking over the reins, Sultan Hasan placed people of his own favor into positions of power. This happened at the expense of dignitaries currently in position; it upset many of them. Discontented Emirs arrested the Sultan in 1351, held him in jail for three years, and promoted his brother as-Salih Salih to the throne. Hasan spent his time in jail studying and his obituaries commented on his learning as a result. He returned to power and again reshuffled the ruling establishment attempting to solidify power, but Sultan Hasan was assassinated by his commander in chief of the army, Yalbugha al-Umari, a Mamluk thought to be loyal. Because of the Sultan's extravagance in spending fortunes on women and other forms of favoritism, the commander rebelled against the Sultan. A contemporary Syrian historian, Ibn Kathir, backed this reputation. Ibn Kathir blamed the sultan for his greed and squandering of public funds. The lavish expenses noted coincide with the Sultan's extensive mosque. After his assassination in 1361, Sultan Hasan's body was never found; the mausoleum never served its purpose.\n\nConstruction\nThe mosque's construction is considered all the more remarkable as it coincided with the devastation wrought by the Black Plague, which struck Cairo repeatedly from the mid-14th century onwards. Its construction began in 1356 CE (757 AH) and work proceeded for three years \"without even a single day of idleness\". In fact, work appears to have continued even up to 1363, even after Sultan Hasan's death, before eventually ceasing. An inscription on the mosque notes the name of amir Muhammad ibn Biylik al-Muhsini as the supervisor of the construction of the mosque. Unusually, his name was placed near Sultan Hasan's in the inscription, which demonstrates how important the undertaking of the project must have been. The amir's high standing otherwise was another indication of this prestige, as he was appointed governor of Cairo in 1330 and oversaw other construction projects including the renovation of the hippodrome established by al-Zahir Baybars near the Citadel.\nThe most substantial available source concerning the mosque's construction is al-Maqrizi, writing six decades afterwards, as he had access to administrative documents that are unavailable to historians today. The manual labour needed for construction must have been partly depleted by the ongoing ravages of the plague, yet this does not appear to have been the main challenge. Maqrizi mentions that the construction of the mosque cost 30,000 dirham every day. The total construction costs amounted to over one million dinars, making it the most expensive mosque in medieval Cairo. Even the Sultan is said to have become discouraged at times by the cost of the project. Financing for the mosque was made possible by a few factors: first, the austerity measures implemented by Manjaq, one of the amirs in charge of state affairs before Sultan Hasan reached maturity; secondly, the influx of wealth to the state caused by the plague-related deaths of many Mamluk amirs whose properties were subsequently transferred to the state treasury, including the enormous wealth of amir Shaykhu; and thirdly, through extortion of the sultan's subjects during his reign.\nThe importance and scale of the building project also attracted craftsmen from all over the Mamluk empire, including the far-away provinces of Anatolia, which may explain the diversity and innovativeness of the mosque's design and decoration. It is also believed that limestone from the Pyramids of Giza was quarried for use in the mosque's construction.\n\nLater events\nDue to the mosque's location near the Citadel and because of its massive and sturdy construction, it was used on more than one occasion as a fortified position or as a platform from which to launch attacks on the Citadel. Al-Maqrizi, noted that \"as soon as there occurred strife between the people the state, a number of amirs and others ascended to the top of the mosque and began to bombard the Citadel from there\". This, in turn, persuaded more than one sultan to order the mosque to be demolished or blocked up. In 1391, rebel amirs against Sultan Barquq mounted the roof of the mosque and launched projectiles at the Citadel, provoking the sultan into ordering the stairs and platform of the entrance destroyed and the doorway boarded up. In 1500, Sultan Janbalat, anticipating another rebel attack from the mosque, ordered it demolished; however, after three days of unsuccessful demolition attempts on the mosque's southeastern (Citadel-facing) walls, he was forced to give up. In 1517, the very last Mamluk sultan, Tumanbay, took refuge inside the mosque in an attempt to evade capture by the victorious Ottoman army as it took control of Cairo, resulting in the Ottomans bombarding the mosque with cannonballs from the Citadel. In 1660, chronicles described the mausoleum's dome as still being full of holes made by cannonballs. Even in the 18th century, during the period of Ottoman control, the mosque was apparently closed for many years after unrest in 1736, and was only reopened in 1786 by order of Salim Agha. Some of these demolition attempts, however, drew criticism from Cairo's population and authorities were often subsequently pressured into repairing damages.\nIn 1659, the northern minaret attached to the mausoleum collapsed. In 1671-1672, the minaret was replaced with a smaller one, with a slightly different form, and at same time the original wooden dome of the mausoleum was replaced with the current dome, also in a different shape from the original.\nIn 1869, construction began on a monumental new mosque, the Mosque of ar-Rifa'i, right next to the existing mosque of Sultan Hasan. Completed in 1912, its size is comparable to Sultan Hasan's construction and it was built in a neo-Mamluk style. The two buildings together now dominate the old Rumayla Square (now renamed Midan Salah ad-Din) across from the Citadel.\n\nArchitectural description\nThe site\nThe mosque occupies almost 8000 square meters in a location close to the Citadel of Cairo. It stands on the site of a lavish palace which had previously been built at great cost by Hasan's father, Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad, for one of his amirs, Yalbugha al-Yahawi, and which was demolished to make way for the mosque. The construction of monumental buildings on this location was likely meant in part to create a pleasing sight for the Sultan to look down on from his palace in the Citadel.\nDuring the medieval era, an open square, known as Rumayla, lay between the mosque and the Citadel. Today, the square is occupied by a large traffic circle and has been renamed Salah ad-Din Square. The square and the former hippodrome nearby (on the southwestern side of the Citadel) were historically used for military parades, equestrian games, and official ceremonies, thus giving the location added symbolic significance.\n\nExterior\nThe building is about 150 meters long, 68 meters wide, and 36 meters high. Like all mosques, it is oriented towards Mecca, which is to the southeast of Cairo. The building's southwestern and northeastern facades (its longer sides) are marked by vertical rows of eight windows each (spread across four stories inside) which are a unique feature that helps to visually emphasize the structure's height. The top edge of the exterior facades are crowned by a thick cornice of muqarnas (stalactite-like carving) projecting 1.5 meters over the rest of the wall, another unprecedented feature in Mamluk architecture, although it does not extend around the entire building. Likewise, a crest of fleur-de-lis-shaped crenellations also ran along the whole length at the very top edge of the walls, but today it is only preserved around the mausoleum's walls on the southeastern side. The southeastern or Citadel-facing walls of the mosque and mausoleum have windows framed by more elaborate stone decoration in various patterns. The triangular-shaped spaces above the bottom windows here were once filled with geometric ceramic decoration, possibly of Anatolian Turkish inspiration.\n\nNear the bottom of the southwestern wall, below today's street level, is a row of stone corbels projecting from the wall which likely served to support the roof of a covered market along the street on this side.\n\nThe minarets\nThe mosque today has two minarets flanking the mausoleum chamber on the southeastern side of the structure. The southern one of this pair, which is still in its original form, is the highest minaret of Mamluk architecture, its summit being 84 meters above the street level at the time. The northern one collapsed in 1659 and was rebuilt in its current form in 1671-72. The original northern minaret was said to be more monumental, and its summit was \"double-headed\"; in other words, it culminated in two lantern structures (instead of the usual one), a feature that reappeared much later in the minaret of Sultan al-Ghuri at the al-Azhar Mosque and in the minaret of the nearby Mosque of Qanibay ar-Rammah.\nAdditionally, two more minarets were originally intended to stand above the monumental portal of the mosque, very much like in the architecture of Mongol Ilkhanid and Anatolian Seljuk madrasas and mosques around the same period (for example, the Gök Madrasa in Sivas, Turkey, or the Great Mosque of Yazd, Iran), which were almost certainly an inspiration. This would have given the mosque a total of four minarets, which would have been unprecedented in Islamic architecture in Egypt. However, in 1361, during construction, one of those minarets toppled and killed around 300 people, including children in the primary school below. After this, the builders abandoned their construction, leaving only the two minarets adjacent to the mausoleum that we see today.\n\nThe entrance portal\nThe entrance portal is gigantic by the standards of mosque architecture and is 38 meters high. It was built at an angle projecting 17 degrees outwards from the rest of the wall so as to be visible from the Citadel. Its shape and the layout of its decoration indicate obvious inspiration from the portals of madrasas and mosques in Anatolian Seljuk and Mongol Ilkhanid architecture of the time, particularly the portal of the Gök (Blue) Madrasa in Sivas, Turkey, built in 1271. On the inside of the portal, behind the stone benches and flanking the doorway, are a pair of marble niches filled with geometric patterns reminiscent of Qur'an illumination and culminating in shallow muqarnas hoods (also Anatolian in style). Above these are black marble panels inlaid with white Kufic Arabic inscriptions of parts of the Surat al-Fath (Sura of Victory) from the Qur'an. The Shahada (the Muslim declaration of faith) is inscribed in \"square\" Kufic higher up above this, while further up is a band of inscription containing another Quranic verse (24:36-37), running along the full width of the inside of the portal, just below the muqarnas canopy.\nThe decoration of the portal was apparently never finished. There are many examples of stone carvings whose initial outlines were drawn into the stone but were never carved out. The broad and impressive muqarnas canopy over the doorway does not appear to be fully carved out either, while above this a section of stone cladding appears to be missing. Other bands of stone-carved decoration were only partially executed. For example, at the foot of the decorative niche on the left side of the portal one arabesque medallion was carved on the left while the one on the right was not. (This is also a rare demonstration of the steps in the stone-carving process: it is likely that a master craftsman drew the outlines of the pattern into the stone and that apprentices were later responsible for carving it out; in this case, the second step was not completed.) Some of the carved patterns, even if unfinished, are themselves notable; for example, there are floral chinoiserie motifs here which appear in other Mamluk crafts of the time but do not appear anywhere else in Mamluk architecture. Another minor but curious feature is the sculpted image of other architectural buildings in some of the carvings just above the stairs leading up to the portal; these are possibly spoils from a Gothic-style Christian monument, presumably from Crusader churches located on the estates donated to the madrasa-mosque's foundation.\nThe original bronze-covered doors of the entrance were forcibly purchased at a modest price by Sultan Mu'ayyad in the early 15th century for use on his own mosque, and can still be seen there today.\n\nInterior\nAlthough the exterior walls of the building are in stone, much of the interior is brick, with facades covered in stucco and finished with stonework for decorative details.\n\nThe entrance vestibule\nThe vestibule chamber upon entering the mosque is an unusually ornate space, covered by a small central dome surrounded by elaborate muqarnas vaults. The dome and half-dome arrangement here is reminiscent of Byzantine architecture, but may have been inspired from Armenian craftsmanship, if not original. The back wall facing the doorway is covered in marble paneling: in the middle is a square panel made of inlaid white and red marble in a geometric pattern of Syrian style, while on either side are marble panels with other carved patterns. From this chamber, a bending passage leads to the central courtyard.\nAlso located behind the walls of the vestibule on the floor plan is a space which may have once housed, or was intended to house, a doctor and medical students, as mentioned in the foundation (waqf) document. The space is now ruined, or might have never been finished.\n\nThe central courtyard and mosque area\nThe enormous central courtyard is a vast square space surrounded by four monumental iwans (vaulted chambers open on one side), of which the qibla iwan (the iwan in the direction of prayer) is larger than the other three. This space acted as a Friday mosque accessible to the public, but it was also used for teaching by the madrasas that were part of the foundation. The four iwans are said to have each been devoted to the teaching of one of the four maddhabs (schools of thought) of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence: the Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, and Shafi'i maddhabs.\nThe size of the main qibla iwan was frequently acknowledged as an awe-inspiring achievement, with Mamluk historians like Maqrizi claiming it was greater than the famous arch of the Sassanid Persian palace of Ctesiphon (still the largest single-span vault of brickwork in the world today). The iwan of Sultan Hasan's mosque is not actually as large as that arch, but the comparison nonetheless emphasized the building's legendary reputation. This iwan is also richly decorated. A monumental inscription in Kufic style, set against a swirling vegetal arabesque background, runs along the entire length of the iwan and is unique in Mamluk architecture. The text is a fragment of the Surat al-Fath (Sura of Victory) from the Qur'an. Below this inscription band, the qibla wall is covered in multicolored marble paneling, centered around the mihrab (the niche symbolizing the direction of prayer) which is framed by its own golden inscription and whose central half-dome hood features a sunrise motif radiating from the word \"Allah\". The stone and marble minbar (pulpit) next to it may have once been covered in inlaid geometric patterns like that on the minbar of the Mosque of Aqsunqur, but this is not visible today. The minbar does still feature finely crafted bronze doors with geometric patterns. A dado of marble also runs along the other two walls of the iwan, although at a much shorter height. A stone platform, known as a dikka, stands in the middle of the space and was where reciters of the Qur'an would recite aloud for communal prayers.\nThe other three iwans and the rest of the courtyard are largely plain except for the doorways at the corners of the courtyard. These doorways lead to the madrasa units and with their own smaller courtyards. They are framed in ablaq stonework, bands of stone inscriptions, and colored mosaics. It is possible that the other iwans were intended to be decorated too but were never finished. Additionally, a marked-out but empty band running along the top edge of the entire courtyard, above the iwans, may have been intended for another monumental inscription.\nThe floor of the central courtyard is paved in rich marble mosaics. The pavement dates from a restoration by the \"Comité\" in 1912, but the patterns may well be from Sultan Hasan's time. The domed pavilion at the center of the courtyard shelters an ablutions fountain (for washing before prayer), but it was originally meant to be only a decorative fountain (ablutions facilities were once located next to the mosque building). The domed structure itself is made of wood and has likely been repaired or restored many times. Its current shape may date from Ottoman times, but it may also be the earliest Mamluk example of this type of fountain.\n\nThe madrasa courtyards\nThe doors in the corners of the main courtyard each lead to one of the four madrasa devoted to one of the four maddhabs (schools of thought in Sunni Islamic jurisprudence). Each was centered on a small courtyard surrounded by four stories of living quarters and cells for students. The madrasas were not of equal size (at least in part because of the irregular floor plan of the mosque, which was limited by existing streets and structures), with the Hanafi and Shafi'i madrasas being the largest, located on either side of the great iwan of the main mosque.\nThese madrasa areas were almost entirely separate from the central courtyard (aside from the doorways leading to them), unlike in other madrasas were the rooms of the students often had windows overlooking the main courtyard. This may have been because the main courtyard was used as a mosque by members of the public and a greater measure of privacy or tranquility was desired for the students. Each madrasa courtyard also had its own smaller iwan used for prayers and oriented towards the qibla (direction of prayer), which was decorated by a stucco inscription band much like the one in the great qibla-side iwan of the main mosque.\n\nThe mausoleum and the dome\nThe position of the mausoleum relative to the rest of the building was unusual in that it was located directly behind the qibla wall of the mosque, meaning it stood in the direction towards which Muslims in the mosque would pray. This is something not found in any other Mamluk religious building, though there is apparently no evidence that this was seen as  controversial at the time. This layout had the consequence of making the mausoleum project outwards into Rumayla square and towards the Citadel, probably to make it more prominent when seen from the Citadel. The mausoleum chamber is accessed from inside the mosque, through a doorway to the left of the mihrab in the qibla wall. On the same wall, on the right side, there is a large, door-sized window which also opens to the mausoleum chamber. This window is distinguished by a set of doors which are notable for their exceptionally fine craftsmanship, made from copper-niello, inlaid with gold and silver, and featuring geometric star patterns and Thuluth-style Arabic inscriptions.\n\nInside, the chamber is even more lavishly decorated, with multicolored marble mosaic paneling on the lower walls and a large painted inscription of the Throne Verse, carved in wood, running around the entire chamber above this. The marble mihrab is similar to the one in the main qibla iwan of mosque. The square chamber transitions gradually to the round dome (12 meters in diameter) with the use of wooden pendentives, typical of Mamluk architecture, which are sculpted into muqarnas forms and richly painted and gilded. \nThe dome of the mausoleum chamber, visible from outside and from the Citadel, is no longer original but was replaced with the current one in 1671. This might have been due to damage from the fallen minaret in 1659 or from cannonballs fired from the Citadel in times of conflict. The original dome was also made of wood, despite the heavy buttressed walls of the chamber being able to support something heavier. However, the original dome had a very different shape. An Italian traveler in the early 17th century described it as being shaped like an egg; more specifically, it started narrow at the bottom then swelled out like a bulb, before finishing in a pointed tip.\nThe cenotaph at the middle of the mausoleum chamber, placed behind a wooden screen, is dated to 1384. Sultan Hasan's body was never found after he was killed and as such he was never buried here. Instead, the tomb is occupied by his two young sons. The mausoleum is also furnished with a large wooden lectern decorated with geometric star patterns and inlaid with ivory, which was meant to hold one of the giant royal copies of the Qur'an owned by the foundation.\n\nOther structures of the foundation\nThe northwestern side of the mosque-madrasa is currently occupied by ruins and excavated remains. A primary school (maktab) once stood on this side, as well as a set of latrines and ablutions fountains. A row of arched rooms or units is also visible, and may have been used for shops as part of a weapons market. There was also a rectangular pool and a waterwheel, probably part of a pre-existing water aqueduct system which brought water to the royal stables of the Citadel.\n\nSee also\nIslam in Egypt\nList of madrasas in Egypt\nList of mosques in Cairo\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\nAl-Khalifa District\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAl-Harithy, Howyda N.

          "content": "The Citadel of Cairo or Citadel of Saladin (Arabic: قلعة صلاح الدين, romanized: Qalaʿat Salāḥ ad-Dīn) is a medieval Islamic-era fortification in Cairo, Egypt, built by Salah ad-Din (Saladin) and further developed by subsequent Egyptian rulers. It was the seat of government in Egypt and the residence of its rulers for nearly 700 years from the 13th century until the construction of Abdeen Palace in the 19th century. Its location on a promontory of the Mokattam hills near the center of Cairo commands a strategic position overlooking the city and dominating its skyline. When it was constructed it was among the most impressive and ambitious military fortification projects of its time. It is now a preserved historic site, including mosques and museums.\nIn addition to the initial Ayyubid-era construction begun by Saladin in 1176, the Citadel underwent major development during the Mamluk Sultanate that followed, culminating with the construction projects of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad in the 14th century. In the first half of the 19th century Muhammad Ali Pasha demolished many of the older buildings and built new palaces and monuments all across the site, giving it much of its present form. In the 20th century it was used as a military garrison by the British occupation and then by the Egyptian Army until being opened to the public in 1983. In 1979, it was proclaimed by UNESCO as a part of the World Heritage Site Historic Cairo (Islamic Cairo) which was \"the new centre of the Islamic world, reaching its golden age in the 14th century.\"\n\nHistory\nOverview\nThe Citadel was built on a promontory beneath the Muqattam Hills, a setting that made it difficult to attack. The efficacy of the Citadel's location is further demonstrated by the fact that it remained the heart of Egyptian government until the 19th century. During this long period, the layout and structure of the Citadel was repeatedly altered and adapted to suit the designs of new rulers and new regimes, which makes it difficult to reconstitute its original plan or even its plan in subsequent periods. There have been three major construction periods leading to the Citadel's current form: 12th-century Ayyubid (starting with Saladin), 14th-century Mamluk (under al-Nasir Muhammad), and in the 19th century under Muhammad Ali. The Citadel stopped being the seat of government when Egypt's ruler, Khedive Ismail, moved to his newly built Abdin Palace in the new downtown Cairo in 1874. Despite its elaborate defenses, the Citadel never ended up being subjected to a true siege, though it was implicated on various occasions in the political conflicts within Cairo or Egypt.\n\nGeneral layout\nIn general, the fortress complex is divided into two parts: the Northern Enclosure (where the National Military Museum is located today), and the Southern Enclosure (where the Mosque of Muhammad Ali is located today). The Northern Enclosure was historically reserved for military garrisons, while the Southern Enclosure was developed as the residence of the sultan. There is also a lower, western enclosure which was historically the site of the royal stables of the Mamluks. However, these functional distinctions were largely erased in the 19th century under Muhammad Ali Pasha, who overhauled the entire site and constructed buildings of various functions throughout the Citadel.\nTo the west and southwest of the Citadel was a long open field frequently referred to as the \"hippodrome\" by historians or as the Maydan (\"plaza\" or \"square\"). For centuries this was maintained as a training ground (especially for horsemanship) and as a military parade ground. Its outline is still visible in the layout of the roads (mainly Salah ad-Din Street) on this side of the Citadel.\nAt the northern end of this hippodrome was another square or plaza known as Rumayla Square (Maydan/Midan Rumayla), today known as Salah al-Din Square (Midan Salah ad-Din) or Citadel Square (Midan al-Qal'a). This was used as a horse market (due to its adjacency to the royal stables), but also as an official square for royal and religious ceremonies. It is occupied today by a large roundabout next to which are the massive mosques of Sultan Hassan and al-Rifa'i.\n\nAyyubid foundation and construction: 12th–13th centuries\nSaladin's original construction\nThe Citadel was begun by the Kurdish Ayyubid ruler Salah al-Din (Saladin) between 1176 and 1183 CE in order to protect Cairo from potential Crusader attacks and to provide a secure center of government for his new regime (only a few years after he had dismantled the Fatimid Caliphate). This also emulated a feature of many Syrian cities, such as Damascus and Aleppo, which had walled citadels that acted as the seat of power and which Saladin was familiar with. Saladin also set out to build a wall, around 20 kilometres long, that would surround both Cairo and Fustat (the nearby former capital), and is recorded as saying: \"With a wall I will make the two [cities of Cairo and Fustat] into a unique whole, so that one army may defend them both; and I believe it is good to encircle them with a single wall from the bank of the Nile to the bank of the Nile.\" The Citadel would be the centerpiece of the wall. While the Citadel was initially completed in 1183–1184, the wall Saladin had envisioned was still under construction in 1238, long after his death. It does not appear to have ever been fully completed after this, though long segments were built.\nSaladin charged his chief eunuch and close confidant, Baha al-Din Qaraqush, with overseeing the construction of the new fortifications. Most of the structure was built with limestone quarried from the surrounding Muqattam Hills; however, Qaraqush also quarried a number of minor pyramids at Giza and even as far away as Abusir in order to obtain further materials. He also made use of labour provided by Christian prisoners of war captured in Saladin's victories against the Crusaders. The initial fortress built in Saladin's time consisted essentially of what is today's Northern Enclosure, although not all elements of the Northern Enclosure's current walls are original. The southeast and northeast sections of these walls are likely the closest to their original forms. Also from Saladin's time is the so-called Yusuf's Well, a deep underground well accessed through a spiral staircase which provided water for the fortress. The original southwestern section of Saladin's enclosure has disappeared but is likely to have extended around this well and around the current site of al-Nasir Muhammad's mosque (making the original enclosure slightly bigger than the existing Northern Enclosure today). The carved image of a double-headed eagle, found near the top of one of the towers of the western walls (near the Police Museum), is a curious feature which is popularly attributed to Salah ad-Din's reign. It was probably located elsewhere originally and then moved here at some point when the walls were rebuilt in Muhammad Ali's time. The eagle's heads are missing today, but their original appearance was noted by chroniclers.\nOnly one original gate, Bab al-Mudarraj, has survived to the present day. It is located along the walls of the Northern Enclosure, nowadays between the Harem Palace (National Military Museum) and the newer Bab al-Jadid gate. It was originally the main gate of the Citadel, but today it is obscured by later constructions from Muhammad Ali's time, including the Bab al-Jadid (\"New Gate\"). Its name was derived from the carved stone steps (darraj) which led up to it from the path that connected the Citadel to the city below. Like other gateways in Ayyubid military architecture, it had a bent entrance. Today, the inside of the gate's dome-vault is covered in plaster with painted inscriptions belonging to Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad and dated to 1310. It was also on this gate that a foundation inscription was discovered which dates the completion of the Citadel to 1183–1184. Nonetheless, construction of one kind or another almost certainly continued under Saladin's Ayyubid successors.\n\nConstruction under Saladin's successors\nConstruction of the Ayyubid Citadel appears to have continued under Sultan al-'Adil (r. 1200–1218), Saladin's brother and later successor, and was probably finished under the reign of al-Kamil (1218–1238). Al-'Adil had already supervised some of the construction under Saladin, while al-Kamil in turn probably worked on the Citadel during al-'Adil's reign when the latter gave him the viceroyship of Egypt in 1200 (a prelude to becoming sultan later). The rounded towers in the outer walls of the Northern Enclosure date from Saladin's initial construction while the large rectangular towers date to al-Adil's reign. The two large round towers in the far northeastern corner of the enclosure, known as Burj al-Ramla (\"Tower of Sand\") and Burj al-Hadid (\"Tower of Iron\") are towers from Saladin's time which al-Kamil subsequently reinforced in 1207.\nMore significantly, al-Kamil built or completed the palaces in the southern section of the Citadel, and became the first ruler to actually move there in 1206. In addition to the palaces, a number of other structures were built, including a mosque, a royal library, and a \"hall of justice\". In 1213 al-Kamil also established a horse market on what became Rumayla Square (the square between the Citadel and Sultan Hasan's mosque today), as well as a maydan, a long open square or \"hippodrome\", to the west and south of the Citadel which was used for equestrian training and military parades. This was on the same site that Ahmad Ibn Tulun established a similar hippodrome in the 9th century. This work established the overall plan of the Citadel area for centuries to come: the northern part of the citadel was devoted to military functions, the southern part to the sultan's private residence and the state administration, and outside, at the southwestern foot of the Citadel, was the parade ground which remained for centuries. Al-Kamil was likely also responsible for building or completing the first water aqueduct which ran along the top of Saladin's city walls to the southwest and brought water from the Nile to the Citadel.\nSultan al-Salih (r. 1240–1249) subsequently moved away from the Citadel again and built himself a new fortified enclosure on Roda Island (which also became the barracks of the Bahri Mamluks who took power after him). Only under the Mamluks, who ruled from 1250 to 1517, did the Citadel finally become the permanent residence of the sultans.\n\nMamluk period: 13th–16th centuries\nEarly Bahri Mamluk period\nUnder the early Bahri Mamluks, the Citadel was continuously developed and the Southern Enclosure in particular was expanded and became the site of important monumental structures. Al-Zahir Baybars, al-Mansur Qalawun, al-Ashraf Khalil and al-Nasir Muhammad each built or rebuilt the audience hall (throne hall), the main mosque, the palaces, or other structures. Unlike the earlier Ayyubid buildings, the Mamluk buildings were increasingly designed to be visible from afar and to dominate the city's skyline. Many of these structures have not survived, with few exceptions.\nBaybars (r. 1260–1277) was the first one to split the Citadel into two areas by building the Bab al-Qulla, the gate and wall which today separates the Southern and Northern Enclosures of the Citadel. It was named after a keep tower which he built nearby and which was later torn down by Qalawun. The gate itself was rebuilt again by al-Nasir Muhammad in 1320. The gate was intended to control access to the newly delimited Southern Enclosure which Baybars then developed into a more elaborate and more exclusive royal complex. A part of the Southern Enclosure became reserved for the harem, the private and domestic area of the sultan and his family, while another part became the site of more monumental structures whose functions were more public, ceremonial, or administrative. Among the structures he built here was one called the Dar al-Dhahab (\"the Hall of Gold\"), which he seems to have used as his private reception hall and which may have been located in the area of the present Police Museum. Another important structure he built in the area is referred to as the Qubba al-Zahiriyya (\"the Dome of al-Zahir\"), a monumental and richly decorated hall with a central dome which acted as an audience hall or throne hall. It may have been a new structure or an addition to an existing Ayyubid structure, and it was probably the predecessor of al-Nasir Muhammad's \"Great Iwan\". Baybars also built the Tower of the Lions (Burj al Siba'), a round tower which featured a stone-carved frieze of lions (Baybars' emblem) along its upper parts. The tower was obscured by later construction but its remains, including the lion carvings, were rediscovered in the late 20th century and are now visible on the northwestern side of the Police Museum.\nSultan al-Mansur Qalawun (r. 1279–1290) either built or significantly renovated a structure known as the Dar al-Niyaba which served as the palace of the sultan's vice-regent. He also demolished Baybars' Qubba al-Zahiriyya and replaced it with his own domed structure, the Qubba al-Mansuriyya. More significantly in the long run, Qalawun was the first to create elite regiments of mamluks (soldiers of slave origin) who resided in the various towers of the Citadel, which earned them the name \"Burji\" Mamluks (Mamluks of the Tower). It was these cohorts of mamluks who would eventually dominate the sultanate during the Burji Mamluk period.\nSultan al-Ashraf Khalil built a qa'a (reception hall) in 1291–1292, referred to as the Qa'a al-Ashrafiyya. Its remains were excavated in the late 20th century and are still visible today, just west of the present-day gate called Bab al-'Alam (Gate of the Flag), across the terrace from the current Police Museum. The remains indicate that the walls of the hall were decorated with multi-coloured marble paneling along the lower walls (a dado), above which was a small frieze of marble mosaics with mother-of-pearl and other marble reliefs, and above all this were panels of glass mosaics with scenes of trees and palaces which are reminiscent of the mosaics of the Ummayyad Mosque and Mausoleum of Baybars in Damascus. (During excavations the mosaics were removed for study and restoration.) The hall also had a central octagonal fountain of marble and the floor was paved with marble mosaics arranged in geometric patterns. It was one of the few structures in this area which al-Nasir Muhammad did not destroy but instead re-used for various purposes, and in the Burji Mamluk period it seems to have replaced the Dar al-Niyaba as the palace of the vice-regent. Al-Ashraf also, once again, demolished the qubba or domed throne hall of his father Qalawun and replaced it with his own structure, the Iwan al-Ashrafiyya (the word \"iwan\" seems to have been used from then on for this particular type of building). This new throne hall differed from previous incarnations in one notable respect: it was painted with pictures of al-Ashraf's amirs (commanders), each with their rank inscribed above his head.\n\nThe reign of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad\nThe greatest builder of the Citadel during the Mamluk period was al-Nasir Muhammad, another son of Qalawun, who was sultan three times over a period of nearly fifty years between 1293 and 1341. It was most likely under his reign that the borders of the Southern Enclosure expanded to their current outline, in order to accommodate the new palaces and structures he built. He is responsible for several major works in the Citadel, though unfortunately most of them fell into ruin during the Ottoman period and were finally demolished by Muhammad Ali in the 19th century. In addition to his official palaces and his semi-public monuments in the Southern Enclosure, al-Nasir reserved the southeastern corner of the enclosure (the location of the al-Gawhara Palace today) for the palaces, private courtyard, and garden devoted to his harem (wives and concubines), probably as Baybars had done, called al-Qusur al-Jawwaniyya. He also commissioned new palaces outside the Citadel but nearby for his favourite amirs, and his projects encouraged the development of areas near the Citadel, such as al-Darb al-Ahmar.\nIn 1312 al-Nasir also ordered the renovation of the water aqueduct which brought water from the Nile to the Citadel. His predecessor, al-Ashraf, is responsible for building an octagonal water intake tower on the shores of the Nile, from which water was raised and transferred along the aqueduct, but al-Nasir completed the project. This improvement of the infrastructure allowed him in turn to embark on more ambitious projects within the Citadel.\n\nThe Ablaq Palace (Qasr al-Ablaq)\nAmong the most important constructions was the Ablaq Palace (Qasr al-Ablaq; sometimes translated as the \"Striped Palace\"), built in 1313–1314. Its name derived from the red-and-black ablaq masonry that marked its exterior. It may have been partly inspired by the palace of the same name that Sultan Baybars had built in Damascus in 1264 and in which al-Nasir resided when he visited that city. The palace was used for regular receptions and private ceremonies. It was connected to the Great Iwan (see below) by a private passage or corridor which led to the sultan's entrance in the back wall of the Iwan. The walls of the palace itself formed a part of the new outer boundary of the Citadel's enclosure: it was located on an escarpment overlooking the city below, and the escarpment, along with the foundation walls of the palace, acted as the effective outer wall of the Citadel at its western corner. Because of this, al-Nasir was able to build a loggia on the side of the palace from which he could freely observe the activities in the stables and in the maydan (hippodrome) at the foot of the Citadel below, as well as a private door and staircase which gave him direct access between the palace and the hippodrome.\n\nThe Great Iwan (al-Iwan al-Kabir)\nAl-Nasir demolished, yet again, the Iwan al-Ashrafiyya (throne hall) of his brother al-Ashraf in 1311, and replaced it with his own structure known as the Great Iwan (al-Iwan al-Kabir). This may have been out of a desire to make it appear even more prominent and monumental, as well as to perhaps accommodate larger ceremonies. In any case, he demolished it (either entirely or in part) and rebuilt it yet again in 1333, and it is this incarnation of the Great Iwan which survived up until the 19th century (when it was destroyed during Muhammad Ali's constructions). It was frequently cited by chroniclers as the most impressive structure in Cairo, more monumental than almost any of the Mamluk mosques. It served as the sultan's public and ceremonial throne room and continued to be used (albeit less consistently) by Mamluk sultans after him.\n\nAl-Nasir Muhammad's Mosque\nLastly, al-Nasir's other most notable contribution, and the only major structure of his reign still preserved at the Citadel, was the Mosque of al-Nasir, also situated in the Southern Enclosure. This was built in 1318 on the site of an earlier Ayyubid main mosque which he demolished in order to serve as the new grand mosque of the Citadel. Al-Nasir renovated his mosque again in 1335. Some of its huge columns were also re-used from Pharaonic-era buildings, much like the columns of the Great Iwan. While its structure is well preserved, most of its rich marble paneling decoration was stripped away and shipped to Istanbul by the Ottoman sultan Selim I after his conquest of Egypt.\n\nLater Mamluk period\nSubsequent sultans continued to build or add to the palaces and administrative buildings inside the Citadel, though rarely with the same ambition as al-Nasir Muhammad. Sultan al-Salih Isma'il (a son of al-Nasir who reigned from 1342 to 1345) built a richly decorated palace or hall known as al-Duhaysha (the \"little wonder\") which was inaugurated in February 1344. Likewise, Sultan Hasan (another son of al-Nasir) built a lavish domed palace known as the Qa'a al-Baysariyya, which was completed in 1360. It was over 50 metres tall and, in addition to a main hall covered by a dome, it also had a tower with an apartment for the sultan which was decorated with ivory and ebony. Other private apartments also had domes, while paintings and portraits decorated the walls. Both Isma'il and Hasan were sons of al-Nasir Muhammad. Sultan Hasan also built his massive madrasa-mosque just northwest of the Citadel, off Rumayla Square, in the 1350s and early 1360s (and still standing today). It was so large and tall that in later years it was reportedly used by rebels as a platform from which to bombard the Citadel on more than one occasion.\nThe Burji Mamluk period saw little construction in the Citadel by comparison with the earlier Mamluk period. The private harem courtyard in the southeastern corner of the Southern Enclosure, known as the hosh, became increasingly used to build new reception halls and other structures with slightly more public functions. The late Burji sultans Qaytbay and al-Ghuri built palaces in this part of the Citadel, on the site of what is now the 19th-century al-Gawhara Palace. Al-Ghuri also restored many other structures in and around the Citadel, including a major restoration/reconstruction of the Citadel's Nile aqueduct. He also restored or reconfigured the Mamluk hippodrome at the southwestern foot of the Citadel, where he installed a vast pool which received water from the restored aqueduct.\n\nOttoman period: 16th–18th centuries\nEgypt was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1517 and remained under Ottoman rule for centuries. Sultan Selim I stripped the monumental Mamluk buildings of their precious materials, especially their marble panels and decoration, and shipped them to Istanbul for use in his own building projects.\nDuring this period the Citadel was neglected and many Mamluk structures fell into ruin, although some of the Citadel walls were rebuilt or extended in the 16th–17th centuries. Due to rivalries between different military corps in the Ottoman forces, the Citadel was divided into three areas to house three different elements of the Ottoman garrison: the Northern Enclosure housed the barracks of the Janissaries, the Southern Enclosure was used by the Ottoman pasha (governor) and his own troops, and another lower western enclosure, which contained the stables, housed the 'Azaban (or Azap) corps. Each section had its own mosque and facilities. In between them was a virtual no-man's-land where some of the former grand Mamluk buildings stood abandoned or under-used. This included the Great Iwan of al-Nasir Muhammad, whose large dome collapsed in 1521 and was never rebuilt. The Ablaq Palace was used more productively as a manufacturing center for weaving the Kiswah, the rich cloth covering the Kaaba in Mecca, which continued to come from Cairo until the 20th century.\nSome notable structures were still created during this period. The huge round tower near the visitor entrance today, standing at the corner of the Southern and Northern Enclosures, was built by Ibrahim Pasha (the later Grand Vizier under Suleiman the Magnificent) in 1525 and is known as the Burj al-Muqattam (\"Tower of the Muqattam Hills\"). The round tower at the other corner of the two enclosures (between Bab al-Qulla and Bab al-Wastani), known now as Burj al-Wastani (\"Middle Tower\"), may also date from this time. The first mosque built in the Citadel after the Mamluk period was the Mosque of Sulayman Pasha in the Northern Enclosure, built by the Ottoman governor in 1528 for use by the Janissaries. It is one of the few mosques in Cairo that represents something close to the classical Ottoman architectural style.\n\nThe lower, western enclosure which can be seen today below the Mosque of Muhammad Ali was historically the area which housed the stables of the Citadel. It's not clear when walls were first built around it, though they were likely already enclosed in Mamluk times. This enclosure was occupied by the 'Azaban soldiers, and contains the Mosque of al-'Azab which was built by Ahmad Katkhuda in 1697. (It is possible that Ahmad Katkhuda merely renovated an existing early Burji Mamluk mosque and added the present-day Ottoman-style minaret to it.) The rest of the area is presently occupied by various 19th-century buildings, including storehouses and old factories. The lower enclosure was accessed from the west through the monumental gate called Bab al-'Azab, which was built by Radwan Katkhuda al-Julfi in 1754, probably on the site of an earlier Mamluk gate known as Bab al-Istabl (Gate of the Stables). The gate was modeled on the old Fatimid gate of Bab al-Futuh in the north of Cairo, but its interior facade was later remodeled into a neo-Gothic style during the Khedival period.\nThe present-dat visitor entrance goes through the small western gate called Bab al-Jabal (\"Gate of the Mountain\") which was built by the Ottoman governor Yakan Pasha in 1785 when he rearranged the area to build a new palace. Yakan also rebuilt a small stretch of the adjoining wall south of here.\n\nMuhammad Ali: 19th-century\nMuhammad Ali was a pasha of Albanian origin who was appointed by the Ottoman sultan in 1805 to restore order after the French occupation of Egypt (1798–1801). However, he subsequently established himself as de facto independent ruler of the country. He consolidated power through a famous and violent coup in 1811 which eliminated the remaining Mamluk class that still formed the country's elites. One of the most pivotal events of this coup took place in the Citadel. Muhammad Ali invited the Mamluk leaders to a celebration banquet in the Citadel, and as they were leaving and passing along the road leading from the upper Citadel to Bab al-Azab, regiments of his Albanian gunmen opened fire from above and massacred all of them.\nThe Citadel is sometimes referred to as the \"Citadel of Muhammad Ali\" (Arabic: قلعة محمد علي Qalaʿat Muḥammad ʿAlī). It contains the Mosque of Muhammad Ali, which he built between 1828 and 1848, perched on the summit of the citadel. This Ottoman-style mosque was built in memory of Tusun Pasha, Muhammad Ali's second son who died in 1816. However, it also represents Muhammad Ali's efforts to erase symbols of the Mamluk legacy that he sought to replace. Many of the former Mamluk structures, including the Great Iwan and the Ablaq Palace of al-Nasir Muhammad, were demolished in 1825 to make way for his new mosque and its renovated surroundings. Muhammad Ali himself was eventually buried in the mosque. His mosque also replaced the nearby Mosque of al-Nasir Muhammad as the Citadel's official main mosque. Muhammad Ali's mosque, with its large dome and tall pencil-like Ottoman minarets, is one of the most prominent monuments on Cairo's skyline to this day.\n\nAnother obvious change that Muhammad Ali enacted pertained to the uses of the Citadel's northern and southern enclosures: during the Mamluk period the Southern Enclosure was the royal residential area and the Northern Enclosure was mostly military, but Muhammad Ali built his Harem Palace (which now houses the National Military Museum) in the Northern Enclosure, erasing the old functional division between the two sections of the Citadel. He also built or rebuilt some of the walls. Notably, he rebuilt the Bab al-Qulla gate and the surrounding wall which separated the Northern and Southern enclosures from each other, giving it its current look. The gate's form today once again emulates the appearance of Bab al-Futuh but introduces some Turkish elements. In 1825 he also built the gate known as Bab al-Jadid (the \"New Gate\") at the point where a new carriage road entered the Citadel from the north. Around the same time he built the Bab al-Wastani (or Bab al-Wustani) (\"Middle Gate\") where the same road continues into the Southern Enclosure (just north of the Bab al-Qulla).\nThe Citadel eventually ceased to act as the residence of Egypt's ruler after Khedive Isma'il (Muhammad Ali's grandson) moved the court to the new 'Abdin Palace, located in the newly created districts of downtown Cairo, in 1874.\n\n20th century and present day\nFor many years up to the late 20th century, the Citadel was closed to the public and used as a military garrison and base; at first by the British Army during the British occupation and afterward up to 1946, and since then by the Egyptian military. In 1983, the Egyptian government opened a large part of the Citadel to the public and initiated refurbishment programs to convert some of its old buildings into museums, though the military retains a presence. It is now a major tourist site for both Egyptians and foreigners alike.\n\nWater supply system\nYusuf's Well (Salah ad-Din's Well)\nTo supply water to the Citadel, Saladin built an 85-metre-deep (280 ft) well known as the Well of Joseph (or Bir Yusuf), so-called because Saladin's birth name, Yūsif, is the Arabic equivalent of Joseph. His chief eunuch and confidant, Qaraqush, who oversaw construction of the Citadel, was also responsible for digging the well. The well is considered a masterpiece of medieval engineering and still exists today. Its shaft was divided into two sections, almost all of which is cut out of the rock itself. The upper part has a wider shaft which is surrounded by a long spiral staircase, separated from the main shaft only by a thin wall of rock. For this reason, the well is also known as the Spiral Well (Bir al-Halazon). The stairs could be covered with earth to make it into a ramp for oxen to travel down to its bottom. The lower part of the well was another shaft descending to the level of underground water seeping in from the Nile. At the bottom of the upper section, two oxen turned a waterwheel that brought the water up from the bottom of the well, while another waterwheel at the top of the well, also powered by oxen, brought the water up the rest of the way.\n\nThe Mamluk Aqueduct\nDuring the reign of al-Nasir Muhammad, Saladin's well was insufficient to produce enough water for the Citadel's growing population and for al-Nasir's envisioned construction projects. To increase the volume of water, al-Nasir renovated an Ayyubid aqueduct system (probably originally completed by al-Kamil) and extended it with a new aqueduct system. This system consisted of a number of water wheels on the Nile which raised water to the top of an hexagonal tower (built by his predecessor al-Ashraf Khalil), from which the water was then transported along a series of raised aqueducts to the base of the Citadel. From the foot of the Citadel, the water was then carried up to the palaces via another system of waterwheels. However, since this water supply could not be guaranteed in the event of a siege, Saladin's well was still an essential water source.\n\nThe Cistern of Ya'qub Shah al-Mihmandar\nThis small domed building just outside the Citadel to the east was built in 1495–96 by an amir called Ya'qub Shah al-Mihmandar, a man originally from Erzincan (Turkey) who joined the Mamluk ranks under Sultan Qaytbay. Because of its dome, the building has the look of a mausoleum but it is actually a structure covering access to a cistern. It has an inscription that memorializes the victory of Sultan Qaytbay's army over Ottoman forces at Adana in a battle in 1486. Today it is cut off from the Citadel and stands stranded between two highways (Salah Salem road and Kobri al-Ebageah) which pass right next to the Citadel on its eastern side.\n\nMosques\nThere are four main mosques in the Citadel today, some of which are open to visitors:\n\nMosque of Muhammad Ali\nThe mosque was built between 1830 and 1848, although not completed until the reign of Said Pasha in 1857. It is located in the Southern Enclosure and is open to the public today. The architect was Yusuf Bushnak from Istanbul and its model was the Sultan Ahmed Mosque in that city. Muhammad Ali Pasha was buried in a tomb carved from Carrara marble, in the courtyard of the mosque. His body was transferred here from Hawsh al-Basha in 1857.\n\nAl-Nasir Muhammad Mosque\nBuilt in 1318, during the early Bahri Mamluk period, as the royal mosque of the Citadel where the sultans of Cairo performed their Friday prayers, today this hypostyle mosque is still similar to how it looked in the 1300s though many repairs have been made and only some of its original decoration has been restored. The parts of the building relying on plastered walls have been reinforced. There have also been attempts to restore the light-blue color of the ceiling. It is located in the Southern Enclosure and is open to the public.\n\nMosque of Sulayman Pasha\nBuilt in 1528, it was first of the Citadel's Ottoman-style mosques and is one of the few structures in Cairo closely resembling the \"classical\" Ottoman style of the 16th century. It is located in the Northern Enclosure, just northeast of the Harim Palace (Military Museum). It was built on the ruins of the earlier Mosque of Sidi Sariyya built by Abu-Mansur Qasta, an amir in the Fatimid era (predating the Citadel). Qasta's tomb, dated to 1140 CE, still exists in the mosque today.\n\nMosque of al-'Azab\nThis lesser-known mosque is situated right behind the main western gate, Bab al-'Azab. Both are named after the Ottoman military regiments known as 'Azaban (or Azaps) who were housed in this part of the Citadel during the Ottoman period. The mosque was built by the Mamluk amir Ahmad Katkhuda in 1697, but it has been argued that it incorporates, or was a renovation of, an earlier Mamluk mosque or religious structure. Although not publicly accessible, it can be spotted by its pointed Ottoman-style minaret.\n\nMuseums\nThe Citadel also contains several museums:\n\nEgyptian Military museum\nThe official museum of the Egyptian Army. The museum was established in 1937 at the old building of the Egyptian Ministry of War in downtown Cairo. It was later moved to a temporary location in the Garden City district of Cairo. In November 1949 the museum was moved to the Harem Palace at the Cairo citadel. It has been renovated several times since, in 1982 and 1993.\n\nAl-Gawhara Palace Museum\nAlso known as Bijou Palace, is a palace and museum commissioned by Muhammad Ali Pasha in 1814.

          "summary": "The Citadel of Cairo or Citadel of Saladin (Arabic: قلعة صلاح الدين, romanized: Qalaʿat Salāḥ ad-Dīn) is a medieval Islamic-era fortification in Cairo, Egypt, built by Salah ad-Din (Saladin) and further developed by subsequent Egyptian rulers. It was the seat of government in Egypt and the residence of its rulers for nearly 700 years from the 13th century until the construction of Abdeen Palace in the 19th century. Its location on a promontory of the Mokattam hills near the center of Cairo commands a strategic position overlooking the city and dominating its skyline. When it was constructed it was among the most impressive and ambitious military fortification projects of its time. It is now a preserved historic site, including mosques and museums.\nIn addition to the initial Ayyubid-era construction begun by Saladin in 1176, the Citadel underwent major development during the Mamluk Sultanate that followed, culminating with the construction projects of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad in the 14th century. In the first half of the 19th century Muhammad Ali Pasha demolished many of the older buildings and built new palaces and monuments all across the site, giving it much of its present form. In the 20th century it was used as a military garrison by the British occupation and then by the Egyptian Army until being opened to the public in 1983. In 1979, it was proclaimed by UNESCO as a part of the World Heritage Site Historic Cairo (Islamic Cairo) which was \"the new centre of the Islamic world, reaching its golden age in the 14th century.\"",

          "content": "Saint Virgin Mary's Coptic Orthodox Church (Coptic: ϯⲉⲕⲕⲗⲏⲥⲓⲁ ⲛ̀ⲧⲉⲑⲉⲟⲇⲟⲕⲟⲥ ϯⲁⲅⲓⲁ ⲙⲁⲣⲓⲁ ϧⲉⲛ ⲃⲁⲃⲩⲗⲟⲛ ⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ Church of Mother of God Saint Mary in Egyptian Babylon), also known as the Hanging Church (Arabic: الكنيسة المعلقة, romanized: al-Kanīsa al-Muʿallaqa, Coptic: ϯⲉⲕⲕⲗⲏⲥⲓⲁ ⲉⲥⲓϣⲓ), is one of the oldest churches in Egypt which dates to the third century. It belongs to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.\n\nName and description\nThe Hanging Church is named for its location above a gatehouse of Babylon Fortress, the Roman fortress in Coptic Cairo (Old Cairo); its nave is suspended over a passage. The church is approached by twenty-nine steps; early travelers to Cairo dubbed it \"the Staircase Church\". The land surface has risen by some six metres since the Roman period, so the Roman tower is mostly buried below ground, reducing the visual impact of the church's elevated position.\nThe entrance from the street is through iron gates under a pointed stone arch. The nineteenth-century facade with twin bell towers is then seen beyond a narrow courtyard decorated with modern art biblical designs. Up the steps and through the entrance is a further small courtyard leading to the eleventh-century outer porch.\n\nHistory\nThe Hanging Church was probably built during the patriarchate of Isaac, though an earlier church building may have elsewhere existed  dating as early as the 3rd or 4th century. However, the earliest mention of the church was a statement in the biography of the patriarch Joseph I (831–849), when the governor of Egypt visited the establishment. The church was largely rebuilt by the Pope Abraham (975–978) and has seen many other restorations including an extensive repair and restoration of the church and its surroundings completed in 2011. Objects of historical interest that were no longer of service went to the Coptic Museum. A set of 10 wooden panels from a door at the church  that were engraved with Christian iconography in 1300 AD can be found in the British Museum.\nThe Babylon Fortress was a citadel built by the Romans and its origin is disputed by Coptic historians. Some date its origin to the nineteenth century B.C, after Pharaoh Sesostris defeated the Babylonians and took the prisoners of Egypt as slaves. The prisoners rebelled, building a fortress around their home which became known as Babylon. Others believe the fortress was built in the late sixth century B.C. by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, after conquering Egypt. The Hanging Church was erected over the citadel's old south Bastions, which marked the main gate to the fortress, and gives the church its ‘hanging’ feature. Beneath the church is the old atrium entrance, with niched walls that once contained statues. Superimposed columns and brick arches were later added to provide reinforcement for the building.\nThe Hanging Church is among the earliest churches in Cairo, competing only with Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church, or Abu Sargah. The church was restored in the sixth century, erasing much of the evidence of the church's origin. Carved reliefs, believed to belong to the earlier structure, closely resemble those found in the first Syrian churches, which can be dated to the third or fourth century. There is also a carved beam over the entranceway which can be dated to 284 AD., the starting date for the Coptic era.  \nIn 840 AD, governor Ali ibn Yahia the Armenian partially destroyed the church during a conflict with the patriarch Anba Yusab. It was later converted into a mosque until the tenth century, when it was reconsecrated. In the eleventh century, the Hanging church became the residence of the Coptic patriarchate, previously in Alexandria.\nPope Abraham (975-978) commissioned one of the first major restorations of the church. The church has also undergone restorations during the reigns of Caliph Haroun El Rasid, El-Aziz Bi'Allah Al Fatemi and Al-Zaher Al Eazaz Din Allah. In 1983, the chapel ceiling collapsed when an engineer had removed an interior column, damaging much of the artwork inside. The 1992 Cairo earthquake caused further damage to the walls of the structure, leading to an additional restoration in 1998 that was completed in 2011.\n\nImportance\nThe Hanging Church is the most famous Coptic Christian church in Cairo, as well as possibly the first built in basilican style.\nThe church is the site of several reported Marian apparitions. She is said to have appeared in a dream to Pope Abraham in the 970s in the story of how the Mokattam Mountain was moved by the faith of Simon the Tanner.\n\nReligious significance\nThe Hanging Church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and contains sanctuaries to her and Saints John the Baptist and George. The church held many important ceremonies for the Coptic hierarchy of Cairo. These include the selection and burial of patriarchs, the former occurring from the 11th to 14th centuries while the latter only between the 11th and 12th, as well as the consecration of holy oil and judgement of heresy trials; selection of the date of Easter for every year was another important proceeding held within. These processes are held at the Hanging Church due to the movement in the 11th century of the patriarchal seat to Cairo from Alexandria.\n\nSeat of Coptic Pope\nThe Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria was, historically, Alexandria. However, as ruling powers moved away from Alexandria to Cairo after the Muslim conquest of Egypt during Pope Christodolos's tenure, Cairo became the fixed and official residence of the Coptic Pope at the Hanging Church in 1047.\nInfighting between the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus and the el Muʿallaqah (the Hanging Church) broke out due to that patriarch's desire to be consecrated in the Hanging Church, a ceremony that traditionally took place at Saints Sergius and Bacchus.\n\nIcons and decoration\nThe Hanging Church has 110 icons, the oldest of which dates back to the 8th century, but most of them date to the 18th century. Nakhla Al-Baraty Bey gave some of them as gifts, in 1898, when he was the overseer of the church.\n\nLayout architectural features\nPresent structure of the church comprises the primitive church in the south and a principal church to the north, believed to be built between the third to seventh century and between the fifth to seventh century respectively.\nThe principal church is a basilica plan contained within a rectangular outer wall and features three apses. Its nave is surrounded by three aisles.\nIts layout is double-aisled but lacks transepts. The ambon (pulpit) features 15 Islamic columns mounted on a white marble slab.\nBy the late 19th century, the primitive church consisted of three chapels and a baptistery and was connected to the south nave of the principal church by the first chapel.\nThe church was periodically altered and restored in response to plundering. This reconstruction included the addition of a barrier wall during the reign of caliph al-Hakim.\n\nNotable features\nCertain original components of the churches were destroyed or damaged due to neglect. Modern replacements date to the 19th century.\n\nAltars\nOf the three ancient altars typical of Coptic churches, none remained by the 19th century and were instead replaced by marble slabs.\n\nCiboria\nThe original ciboria were reported to have been present at the altars but were since replaced.\n\nMosaics and reliefs\nMosaics in crosses in relief are found within an ambo located north of the principal church's central nave. The primitive church contains mosaics in a hollow in the south wall.\n\nFacade and interior\nSee also\nChristian Egypt\nCoptic architecture — information on Coptic Orthodox Churches\nList of Coptic Orthodox churches in Egypt\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Hanging Church at Wikimedia Commons",

According to local folklore, it is located on the site where baby Moses was found.\nIt is also known as 'the Synagogue of the Palestinians' or 'of the Jerusalemites'.\nGiven the small population of Egyptian Jews, the synagogue is no longer active and is largely a tourism site and Jewish museum.\nThe geniza or store room of the synagogue was found in the 19th century to contain a treasure of forgotten, stored-away Hebrew, Aramaic and Judeo-Arabic secular and sacred manuscripts. The collection of approximately 400,000 items, known as the Cairo Geniza, was brought to the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England at the instigation of Solomon Schechter. It is now divided between several academic libraries, with the majority being kept at the Cambridge University Library.\n\nHistory\nOutline\nThe Ben Ezra Synagogue has occupied at least three buildings in its long history. There have been many major and minor renovations. The current building dates from the 1890s. \nIn a courtyard behind the buildings is the Well of Moses, in a fenced enclosure with a protective grill on its top. In local folklore, this is where the biblical Moses, as an infant, was hidden by his mother Jocheved, and watched over by his sister Miriam, until found and adopted by the Pharoah's daughter; and where Mary drew water to bathe the infant Jesus.\n\nEstablishment\nThe Ben Ezra Synagogue's founding date is unknown, although there is good evidence from documents found in the geniza that it predates 882 CE and is probably pre-Islamic. In 882, the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church sold a church and its grounds to a group of Jews, and some 19th-century scholars have assumed that this was the origin of Ben Ezra. However, the buyers were followers of the Talmudic academies in Babylonia, and Ben Ezra was a congregation that observed the teachings of the rival Talmudic academies in Syria Palaestina. Modern scholars agree that the 882 land sale was to a rival synagogue.\nLittle is known about the original building. In about 1012, the Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah ordered the destruction of all Jewish and Christian places of worship. The original Ben Ezra Synagogue was torn down, \"its bricks and timber sold for scrap\".\n\nSecond building (11th century – 1168)\nThe next caliph, al-Zahir li-i'zaz Din Allah, allowed the reconstruction of Christian and Jewish institutions, and the synagogue was rebuilt in the 1025–1040 period. Study of a carved wood Torah ark door reliably attributed to the synagogue sheds light on the history of the synagogue's renovations. The door is jointly owned by the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, and the Yeshiva University Museum in New York. Radiocarbon dating verifies that the wood dates from the 11th century CE.\n\nGeniza\nHistorically, synagogues have included a genizah, or repository for abandoned or outdated documents containing the name of God, since Jewish teaching is that such papers had to be stored with reverence, and then eventually buried in a cemetery. The 11th-century building incorporated an unusually large geniza, \"two stories high, more silo than attic – with a rooftop opening accessible from above.\" Some documents added to it had been stored in the previous building, and the oldest dated document is about 150 years older than the geniza itself. Documents continued to accumulate there for about 850 years. The diverse collection of documents included rabbinical texts, historical accounts, and religious and secular poems, dating from the sixth century through the nineteenth century CE.\n\n1168 fire\nIn 1168, a deliberately set fire destroyed much of the city of Fustat, where the synagogue was then located. Fustat is now a part of Cairo. The Islamic vizier Shawar ordered the city burned to prevent it from falling into the hands of an invading Christian Crusader army. Saladin, who became Sultan of Egypt shortly thereafter, ordered the rebuilding of Fustat.\n\nThird building\nMaimonides in Fustat (1168–1204)\nAlso in 1168, the Jewish philosopher, physician and astronomer Maimonides settled in Fustat, within a short walk of Ben Ezra Synagogue. He lived there until his death in 1204. Maimonides became Nagid, or leader of the Egyptian Jewish community in 1171, and worshipped at Ben Ezra. Many of the geniza documents, including some in his own handwriting, discuss his life and work, and are the most important primary biographical sources for him.\n\nTorah ark\nThe style of the carving on the Torah ark door is incompatible with that of the Fatimid Caliphate (909–1171 CE), and is more representative of the Mamluk Sultanate (1250–1571 CE), specifically the 15th century. A medallion that decorates the door is designed with a motif common to bookbinding of that period. It is known that a 15th-century fire in the synagogue damaged the bimah, or pulpit. One plausible theory is that wood from the damaged bimah was repurposed to make a new door for the Torah ark. The synagogue was repaired and renovated in 1488.\nThe door also has traces of paint that conservators have identified as being no older than 19th century. It is known that the synagogue was renovated in the 1880s, completely rebuilt in the early 1890s, and then remodeled in the early 20th century.\n\nDiscovery of the geniza and fourth building\nJacob Saphir was a Jew born in what is today Belarus whose family settled in Ottoman Palestine when he was a boy. He became a rabbi, and in 1859, took a world tour to raise money for the reconstruction of the Hurva Synagogue in Jerusalem, which had been destroyed by the Muslim authorities in 1721. Saphir was the first to recognize the historic significance of the Ben Ezra geniza, which he described in an 1874 book. Jewish book collector Elkan Nathan Adler was the first Western European to enter the geniza in 1896, when he purchased a sackful of selected documents. In December 1896, Cambridge University instructor Solomon Schechter, who later became a prominent American rabbi, began the first in-depth academic investigation of the documents from the geniza, and arranged to have a large selection removed from Cairo to his university library. While the synagogue was being rebuilt from 1889 to 1892, the documents lay in an enormous pile out in the open. Egyptologist Count Riamo d'Hulst, arriving after Schechter's departure, hired a team of workers and spent 55 days excavating and examining as much of the documents as he could, and in May 1898 sent 16 large sacks of material to the Bodleian Library.\n\nDwindling congregation\nEgypt's Jewish community is at the end of a dramatic decline, from about 80,000 people in the 1920s to less than a dozen of Egyptian ancestry residing in Cairo after 2014. Accordingly, the Ben Ezra Synagogue functions now as a tourist attraction and museum, rather than as a functioning congregation.\n\nRenovations\nEgyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly inaugurated the synagogue on 31 August 2023 following a decade-long renovation. The renovation was completed by the Drop of Milk Association that works to preserve Egyptian Jewish heritage. The synagogue's ceiling was reinforced to prevent collapse, the library was heavily restored, and the building was further cleaned and insulated. Given the small population of Egyptian Jews, the renovation was largely done to improve tourism to the synagogue. In December 2023 it was reported that there were tensions between the surviving Jews and the government authority responsible for managing the site.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nCairo Geniza\nHistory of the Jews in Egypt\nSynagogues in Cairo\nList of synagogues in Egypt\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n\"Ben Ezra Synagogue after restoration\".

          "content": "Khan el-Khalili (Arabic: خان الخليلي) is a famous bazaar in the historic center of Cairo, Egypt. Established as a center of trade in the Mamluk era and named for one of its several historic caravanserais, the bazaar district has since become one of Cairo's main attractions for tourists and Egyptians alike. It is also home to many Egyptian artisans and workshops involved in the production of traditional crafts and souvenirs. The name Khan el-Khalili historically referred to a single building in the area; today it refers to the entire shopping district.\n\nHistory\nThe site of Khan el-Khalili in Fatimid times (10th-12th centuries)\nCairo was originally founded in 969 CE as a capital for the Fatimid Caliphate, an empire which by then covered much of North Africa and parts of the Levant and the Hijaz. Jawhar al-Siqilli, the general who conquered Egypt for the Fatimids, was ordered to construct a great palace complex to house the caliphs, their household, and the state's institutions. Two palaces were eventually completed: an eastern one (the larger of the two) and a western one, between which was a plaza known as Bayn al-Qasrayn (lit. 'Between the Two Palaces'). The site of Khan el-Khalili today was originally the southern end of the eastern Fatimid palace as well as the location of the burial site of the Fatimid caliphs: a mausoleum known as Turbat az-Za'faraan ('the Saffron Tomb'). Also located here was a lesser palace known as al-Qasr al-Nafi'i (today the site of the 19th-century Wikala of Sulayman Agha al-Silahdar).\nUnder the Fatimids, Cairo was a palace-city which was closed to the common people and inhabited only by the Caliph's family, state officials, army regiments, and other people necessary to the operation of the regime and its city. The first attempts to open the city to merchants and other outsiders took place in the later Fatimid period, on the initiative of powerful viziers. Between 1087 and 1092, Badr al-Jamali, the vizier under Caliph al-Mustansir, undertook the task of enlarging the city and building the stone walls and gates that still partly exist today. At the same time, he also opened the city to the common people, but the decision was quickly reversed. Between 1121 and 1125, al-Ma'mun al-Bata'ihi, vizier under Caliph al-Amir, undertook many reforms and construction projects, including the creation of a mint, known as the Dar al-Darb, and of a customs house for foreign merchants, known as the Dar al-Wikala. These were placed in a central location not far from the current site of the 15th-century Madrasa of al-Ashraf Barsbay. This introduced foreign trade into the heart of the city for the first time.\n\nDevelopment of Cairo as economic center (12th-14th centuries)\nCairo was only definitively opened to all people under the rule of Saladin, who dismantled the Fatimid Caliphate in 1171 and embarked on the construction of a new fortified Citadel further south, outside the walled city, which would house Egypt's rulers and state administration. The old Fatimid palaces in the city were opened up to redevelopment. This ended Cairo's status as an exclusive palace city and started a process by which the city became an economic center inhabited by everyday Egyptians and frequented by foreign travelers. At the same time, the nearby port city and former capital of Fustat, until then the economic hub of Egypt, was in a slow decline, further paving the way for Cairo's ascendance.\nThe main axis of Cairo was the central north-to-south street known as the Qasaba (now known as al-Muizz Street), which ran between the gates of Bab al-Futuh and Bab Zuweila and passed through Bayn al-Qasrayn. Under the Ayyubids and the later Mamluks, this avenue became a privileged site for the construction of religious complexes, royal mausoleums, and commercial establishments. These constructions were usually sponsored by the sultan or members of the ruling class. This is also where the major souqs of Cairo developed, forming its main economic zone for international trade and commercial activity thereafter.\nAn important factor in the development of Cairo's economic center was the growing number of waqf institutions, especially during the Mamluk period. Waqfs were charitable trusts under Islamic law which set out the function, operations, and funding sources of the many religious/civic establishments built by the ruling elite. Funding sources often included the revenues of designated shops or other commercial establishments. Among the early and important examples of this institution in Cairo's center was the complex of Sultan Qalawun, built in 1284–85, which included a madrasa, hospital, and mausoleum. A part of the complex's revenues came from a qaysariyya (a bazaar or market complex made up of rows of shops) that was built in front of the nearby Ayyubid-era madrasa of al-Salih. This qaysariyya was a prominent early example of the purpose-built commercial structures that came to be erected in Cairo under the Mamluks as part of a waqf. Qalawun's qaysariyya had a front on the Qasaba street while some of its shops were reached by an inner alley off the main street.\n\nFoundation of Khan al-Khalili in the Mamluk period (14th-15th centuries)\nOver many years, space along the Qasaba avenue steadily narrowed as new constructions encroached on it and open spaces disappeared. As the main street became saturated with shops and space for further development there ran out, new commercial structures were instead built further east, close to al-Azhar Mosque and to the shrine of al-Hussein, where some space was still available. Instead of hosting mobile market stalls that were assembled in open spaces, the city's souq areas were progressively replaced by fixed stone structures with built-in spaces for individual shops. This was partly a consequence of the authorities wishing to impose greater control on commercial activities: fixed structures could be counted, taxed, and regulated more easily than makeshift market stalls that could come and go. As the city became denser and space ran out, builders preferred to build multi-storied structures known as a khan (Arabic: خان) or a wikala (Arabic: وكالة), a type of caravanserai (inns for merchants). These types of buildings were centered around an inner peristyle courtyard where merchants could store their goods, while the upper levels were used as living quarters. Their street facades typically had spaces for shops at ground level. In this way, a commercial zone could extend around and between multiple khans.\nBy the time of Sultan Barquq (r. 1382–1399), the first Burji Mamluk sultan, Egypt had been significantly affected by the ravages of the Black Death but continued to be the center of great economic activity, with many commercial and religious buildings still being constructed at this time. During Barquq's first reign (1382–1389) his Master of the Stables (amir akhur), Jaharkas al-Khalili, demolished the Fatimid mausoleum (Turbat az-Za'faraan) to erect a large khan at the heart of the city. The khan became known as Khan al-Khalili, after his name. The name eventually came to denote the entire district. Al-Khalili reportedly disposed of the bones of the Fatimid royal family by throwing them into the rubbish hills east of the city.\nLater Mamluk elites also built commercial structures in the vicinity and beyond. In Sultan Qaytbay's time one of his amirs, Yashbak min Mahdi, built the Rab' al-Badistan, an apartment complex for renters, just across from the Khan al-Khalili. Qaytbay himself built the Wikala of Sultan Qaytbay further east, near al-Azhar Mosque. By the late 15th century, the district around Khan el-Khalili had become the major center of foreign trade, including the sale of slaves and precious stones.\n\nRe-development by Sultan al-Ghuri (early 16th century)\nIn the early 16th century, Sultan al-Ghuri, Egypt's last effective Mamluk sultan (r. 1501–1516), modified the layout of the whole district through a major campaign of demolition and new construction. In addition to building his own religious and funerary complex and a large Wikala named after him nearby, he demolished the original khan built by al-Khalili and rebuilt it in 1511. It became known as the Khan al-Fisqiya (\"Khan of the Fountain\") for centuries, until later being known as the Wikala al-Qutn (\"Wikala of Cotton\"). Al-Ghuri also reconfigured the adjacent area into a souq known as the Suq al-Nabulsi, which featured monumental stone gates. He also tried to impose a more regular grid plan on the surrounding district. Along with the stone gates, this sort of complex resembled what in Ottoman cities was known as a bedesten: a central bazaar where the most precious goods were sold and which often had roofed streets and locked gates at night (similar in some ways to a qaysariyya). It is possible that al-Ghuri's construction was done in imitation of such commercial complexes in major Ottoman cities, as this was a time when the Ottoman Empire was the major rival of the Egyptian Mamluk state and when Turkish merchants were increasingly prominent in Cairo.\nWhat remains today from al-Ghuri's time is the Suq al-Nabulsi and its two ornate stone gates, as well as the façade and entrance of the Wikala al-Qutn. All these structures are located along the street known as Sikkat al-Badistan. The western gate was originally known as Bab al-Silsila but is known today as Bab al-Badistan, while the eastern gate, across from the Wikala al-Qutn's entrance, was originally known as Bab al-Nuhhas but is now known also as Bab al-Ghuri.\n\nLater history (16th century and after)\nFrom the Mamluk period onward, the Khan al-Khalili area was made up of several major khans or wikalas grouped together, with souq streets existing between them. By the end of the Mamluk period in the early 16th century, there were 21 khans and wikalas in the district. From al-Ghuri's reign onward, the district became associated with Turkish merchants and during the Ottoman period (after 1517) the Turkish community of Cairo was centered here. The Wikala al-Qutn, which had replaced the original Khan al-Khalili structure, was inhabited by Turkish merchants.During the Ottoman period the prosperity of Cairo's souqs waxed and waned in accordance with local political conditions and international economic conditions. While Cairo was no longer an imperial capital, it still played a highly important role in the trade networks of the Ottoman Empire. New khans and wikalas continued to be built. The construction of new commercial buildings began to shift to the west of the Qasaba avenue as this was the only area where there was still space to build. New constructions were relatively rare in the 16th century but became more common again in the 17th century. Many old buildings were also restored, altered, or rebuilt, especially during the 18th century. In contrast with the Mamluk period, new religious complexes were rarely built, but many small mosques or prayer areas were added inside existing commercial buildings. By the end of the 18th century, just before Napoleon's invasion, some 39 khans and wikalas existed in the area of Khan al-Khalili and its adjoining districts. One late example of a large wikala built in the heart of Khan al-Khalili is the Wikala of Sulayman Agha al-Silahdar (or Wikala al-Silahdar), built in 1837 to replace a ruined Mamluk-era khan. It is still partially standing today, directly across from Bab al-Ghuri.\nThe district underwent significant modifications and re-developments again in the 19th and 20th centuries alongside major developments in the urban fabric of modern Cairo to the west. Al-Muski Street, a popular market street today, was created by cutting across the fabric of the old city to create a street roughly perpendicular to al-Muizz Street (the old Qasaba avenue). It runs from al-Hussein Square in the east to Midan 'Ataba ('Ataba Square) in modern downtown Cairo to the west. Among other important re-developments was the construction of about two dozen new residential blocs with ground-level shops in the eastern sector of the souq, initiated by the princess Shawikar in the late 1930s. This eastern area is now one of the most frequented by tourists.\n\nPresent day\nThe Khan el-Khalili today is occupied by local merchants and traders and is significantly geared towards tourists. Shops typically sell souvenirs, antiques and jewelry. The adjoining goldsmiths' souq is still important for locals. Although less widespread than in earlier days, many crafts workshops continue to operate within the bazaar (usually in the courtyards or upper floors of buildings) and in the surrounding districts, manufacturing some of the products sold here or exported elsewhere.\nIn addition to shops, there are several coffeehouses (Arabic: مقهى, romanized: maqha), restaurants, and street food vendors distributed throughout the market. The coffeeshops are generally small and quite traditional, serving Arabic coffee and usually offering shisha. One of the oldest and most famous coffeehouses is El-Fishawy Café, established in 1773.\n\nThe Khan al-Khalili proper is delimited by al-Muizz Street to the west, al-Muski Street to the south, and the Mosque/shrine of al-Hussein to the east, with its northern boundary less clear. In reality though, the bazaar area spreads beyond these limits and is closely integrated into the surrounding districts.  For example, al-Muski street, which runs perpendicular to al-Muizz street and cuts across the south end of Khan al-Khalili, continues over a long distance and functions as a major souq street frequented by locals for much of its length.\nIn addition to the important Mosque and shrine of al-Hussein, Al-Azhar University and the Al-Azhar Mosque are also nearby. The monumental area of Bayn al-Qasrayn is also just northwest of the district. Some of its historic Islamic buildings were once maintained with the help of revenues from designated shops and commercial buildings in the area.\n\nIn literature\nNaguib Mahfouz's novel Midaq Alley (1947) is set in an alley in Khan el-Khalili.\nPivotal events of Neal Stephenson's novel The Confusion (2004), which is the second book of his The Baroque Cycle series, are set in the caravanserai within Khan el-Khalili.\nMohammed Avdol, one of the main characters of Stardust Crusaders, the third part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, owns a fortune-telling shop in Khan el-Khalili.\nP. Djeli Clark's short story The Angel of Khan el-Khalili takes place in this area and other parts of Cairo.\n\nTerrorist attacks\n\nThe market was a target of terrorism during the spate of attacks in Cairo in April 2005. The suicide attack in the market, on April 7, killed 21 people (eleven Egyptians, two French tourists, one American, and seven foreigners of unidentified origin). It was the first attack in the series; this attack drove away tourists from Egypt in general and Khan el-Khalili in particular for some time.\nThe market was again a target of terrorism on 22 February 2009. In this attack a 17-year-old French girl was killed and 22 people were injured.",
          "summary": "Khan el-Khalili (Arabic: خان الخليلي) is a famous bazaar in the historic center of Cairo, Egypt. Established as a center of trade in the Mamluk era and named for one of its several historic caravanserais, the bazaar district has since become one of Cairo's main attractions for tourists and Egyptians alike. It is also home to many Egyptian artisans and workshops involved in the production of traditional crafts and souvenirs. The name Khan el-Khalili historically referred to a single building in the area; today it refers to the entire shopping district.",

شعبيه، كما يتميز بكثره اعداد السياح واعتياد سكانه عليهم.\nحي خان الخليلي كان مصدر الهام للعديد من الكتّاب والادباء المصريين ابرزهم الكاتب نجيب محفوظ الذي الّف احدى رواياته التي تدور احداثها بالحي وتحمل اسمه «خان الخليلي» والتي تم تحويلها الى فيلم سينمائي من بطوله الممثل عماد حمدي.\n\nتاريخ خان الخليلي\nيبلُغ عُمر حيّ «خان الخليلي» العتيق، 600 عام، حيثُ يُعتبر واحدًا من اقدم الاسواق في انحاء المحروسه والشرق الاوسط، وما زال مُحتفظًا بمعماره القديم مُنذُ عصر المماليك، حسبمّا تؤكد الهيئه العامه للاستعلامات المصريه.\nفلم يتاثر خان الخليل بعوامل الزمن، وظل مُلهمًا للادباء والفنانين، فيُحرّض اخيلتهم دائمًا على الابداع، مثلما كتبَ، نجيب محفوظ، روايتهُ «خان الخليلي» من وحيّ اجواء الحيّ القديم، واصفًا اياه بـ: «ستجِد في الشارع الطويل، عِمارات مُربعه القوائم تصِل بينها ممرات جانبيه تقاطع الشارع الاصليّ، وتزحُم جوانب الممرات والشارع نفسه بالحوانيت (ايّ الدُكان)؛ فدُكان للساعاتي وخطاط واخر للشاي، ورابع للسجاد وخامس للتُحف وهكذا. بينما يقع هُنا وهناك مقاهي لا يزيد حجم الواحده منها عن حجم الحانوت (الدُكان) الصغير، وقدّ جلسَ الصنَّاع امام الدكاكين يكبون على فنونهم في صبر.\nوُيذكر انّ الخان هو مبنى على شكل مربع كبير، ويحيط بفناء يُشبه الوكاله، فيما تضُم الطبقه الوسطى منهُ المحلات، اما الطبقات العليا فتحتضِن المخازن والمساكن، بينما ترجع تسميتُه الى صاحب امر انشاءه عام 784هجريًا، ايّ 1382 ميلاديًا، وهو الامير جهاركس الخليلي، احد الامراء المماليك، من الخليل فلسطين، وتروي الحكايات التاريخيه انّهُ بعد مقتل الخليلي في دمشق، ازالَ السلطان المملوكي قنصوه الغوري الخان، واقامَ مكانُه وكالات ودكاكين للتُجار، فاكتسب المكان طابع تاريخيّ مُحلىَ باثار المماليك.\nولو عدنا بالزمان الى الوراء كثيراً فسوف يطالعنا المؤرخ العربي الاشهر (المقريزي) الذي يقول ان الخان مبنى مربع كبير يحيط بفناء ويشبه الوكاله، تشمل الطبقه السفلي منه الحوانيت، وتضم الطبقات العليا المخازن والمساكن، وقد سمي بهذا الاسم نسبه الى منشئه الشريف (الخليلي) الذي كان كبير التجار في عصر السلطان برقوق عام 1400 م.\nواذا كان المثل الشعبي يقول: ان «الرجل تدب مكان ما تحب»، فان اول دبه على ارض الخان لا بد ان تكون في مقهى الفيشاوي، الذي يزيد عمره عن مائتي عام، وهو من اقدم مقاهي القاهره، وكان الكاتب الكبير نجيب محفوظ من اشهر روّاده في فتره الستينات من القرن العشرين .\n\nمقهى الفيشاوي\nيعتبر من المقاهي القديمه في مصر ويرجع تاريخ تاسيسه عام 1769م.\nعبقريه المكان في مقهى الفيشاوي الذي يتصدر الخان تستطيع ان تحتسي الشاي الاخضر، وتثرثر في اي شيء كيفما شئت، قبل ان تبدا الجوله في الحي العتيق وليس هناك ماهو امتع من التجوال سيراً على الاقدام داخل ازقه وحواري تحتاج الى عبقريه في فك الغازها، والى حاسه سادسه لمعرفه طلاسمها، فالازقه متراصه كحبات عقد، متداخله كقوس قزح متعدد الالوان، ولايعرف احد حتى الان الفلسفه المعماريه التي بني على اساسها خان الخليلي، فالارض مبلطه بحجر بازلتي اسود لامع، والسوق مسقوف بخشب تحدى الزمن وعوامل التعريه، والشمس تتسلل الى حوانيت عديده تشكل مع بعضها سراديب مليئه بالكنوز والتحف النادره، والمصنوعه بمهاره.\n\nداخل الخان\nواذا بدات الرحله في الخان فلابد وان تلقي نظره على ماتبقى من (مشربيات) مطله على الشارع او الحاره، واسبله جميله مشغوله واجهاتها بالنحاس وفيها احواض الماء التي كانت تروي العطشان وعابر السبيل في الزمن الذي كان. ويحتاج زائر الحي الى عبقريه او حساسيه خاصه في المرور داخل الازقه الضيقه وسط زحام اسطوري من البشر والمقاعد الخشبيه التي رصها اصحاب المقاهي لجذب الرواد، وبمجرد ان تدخل الشارع يتناهى الى الاسماع عبارات الترحيب المصريه خفيفه الظل، وكلمات اولاد البلد المرحبه تدعو الزائرات والزائرين للفرجه، «واللي مايشتري يتفرج». ولو دخلت احد الحوانيت فان البائع يستقبلك بعباره «مصر نورت» ويرد الزائر الذي له خبره بعالم القاهره السحري ومفرداتها اللغويه «مصر منوره باهلها»، ويبدا في عرض ما لديه من بضائع، لاتفارقه ابتسامته، وكلماته المتدفقه حول جوده بضاعته، وانها صنعت خصيصاً لعشاق الفن اليدوي. وتجار الخان خبراء في فن البيع، ورثوا التجاره والشطاره عن الاجداد، وهم يعرضون الاصيل والمزيف من البضائع، ولهم ولع عجيب بالمساومه، كما يتسمون بصبر وجلد على اقناع الزبون.\nحي خان الخليلي هو واحد من ثمانيه وثلاثين سوقاً كانت موزعه ايام المماليك على محاور القاهره، ويقع هذا الخان وسط المدينه القديمه فوق مقابر الخلفاء الفاطميين سابقاً.\nوكان المعز لدين الله قد استحضر معه من (القيروان) توابيت ثلاثه من اسلافه ودفنهم في مقبرته، حيث دفن هو وخلفاؤه ايضاً، وقد امر الخليلي بنقل المقابر الى اماكن اخرى وتاسيس سوق للتجار.\nوالاسلوب الذي كانت تعرض به البضائع في القاهره القديمه حيث كانت تتلاصق الاسواق وتمتلئ الحارات بالحوانيت التي تعرض نفس البضاعه باسعار متفاوته، امر اشبه مايكون بمعرض دائم ومستمر للبضائع المختلفه، ممايتيح فرصه ممتازه للمشتري في ان ينتقى مايريد ويختار الاجود، ويفاصل ويساوم ليحصل على الامتن والارخص.\nهنا بضائع من كل صنف ولون، من الذهب والماس والفضه الى اوراق البردي التي تحمل كلمات الهيروغليفيه وتمائم وايقونات وقصائد غزليه، ونقوشات باللون الازرق تحكي في اختزال مدهش اجمل حكايه عشق في التاريخ (حكايه ايزيس واوزوريس) التي يقبل عليها السياح الاجانب.\n\nمهرجان البضائع\nكرنفال الزائرات والزائرين لحي خان الخليلي يتداخل مع ملابس مزركشه رصها اصحاب الحوانيت كنوع من العرض والاغراء والجذب على واجهه المحلات، وتتدلى مئات وربما الاف (المسابح) داخل فترينات العرض، او في ايدى صبيه صغار يعرضون انواعاً شتى من المسابح، بعضها مصنوع من بذر الزيتون والبلاستيك وتسمى (نور الصباح)، وبعضها الاخر ينتمي لفصيله الفيروز والمرجان والكهرمان واليسر، ومنها مايصنع من خشب الصندل، ويقول احد الصناع المهره ان المسبحه تصنع على اله يدويه صغيره ودقيقه اسمها (المخرطه).\nوفي خان الخليلي تحرص النساء من كل الجنسيات على شراء (العقد) الذي تتدلى منه (عين حورس)، وتصنع العقود من خامات شتى، وما على الزبون الا تحديد طلبه وفق امكاناته الماليه، وهنا يخرج له البائع (تحفه فنيه) ربما مر على صناعتها مئات السنين، يوم ان كانت القاهره في العصور الوسطى مركزاً تجارياً عظيماً، تجلب بضائع الشرق الاقصى وترسلها في شتى طرق الملاحه في البحر الابيض المتوسط. كان ذلك في العصر الذهبي لتجاره التوابل مع بلاد الهند والسند وبلاد تركب الافيال وتشترى الرجال، ففي القرن السادس عشر نقل الى خان الخليلي اغرب سوق في تاريخ القاهره القديمه والحديثه، وهو سوق (العبيد) الذي ذاع صيته في الشرق والغرب ووصفه الرحاله باعتباره من اهم الاسواق التي اختلطت فيها جميع الجنسيات.\nلقد انتهي ذلك العصر بكل مافيه من ملامح عظيمه او تجاعيد انهيار، ونحن الان في عصر جديد مختلف، ينظر فيه السائحون والزوار الى البضائع المتناثره في الارجاء والفاترينات على انها (هديه) من قاهره المعز لدين الله الفاطمي، وفي المحلات الصغيره المتلاصقه ابداع التجار في رص المشغولات الذهبيه والفضيه والنحاسيه.\nويذكرك مشهد هذه المحلات باسواق تركيا التي تسمى (البازار) والتي تحتل شوارع هائله تقع تحت مدينه (اسطنبول) حيث تمتد شوارع بكاملها تتخصص بنوع واحد من البضائع. على ان اهم مايلفت النظر في مشغولات خان الخليلي هو دقه الصناعه اليدويه، هناك محلات تعرض قلاده او اسوره عليها نقوشات ومنمنمات قضى في نقشها صانع ماهر اياماً وربما شهور. والذهب هو الذهب مهما مر الزمان او تغيرت الاوطان، والسياح الاجانب يحرصون على شراء المشغولات الفضيه، لكن السياح العرب يحبون الذهب، وقد زحفت محلات من شارع الصاغه الشهير الى خان الخليلي بحثاً عن (زبون) رفيع الذوق، يقدر ما بين يديه من نفائس.\n\nاسواق القاهره\nكان في القاهره الفاطميه اسواق متعدده، وساحات عامه شيدت لاغراض التجاره وهي التي تسمى كل منها (قيساريه) وقد خصصت كل واحده منها لبيع سلعه معينه، وبعضها يبيع الاشياء التي تجلبها القوافل من الحبشه مثل العقاقير والببغاوات والتبر، وقد كان هناك اسواق خاصه للاحجار الكريمه في شارع الموسكي، لكنه استقر الان في خان الخليلي، عقيق ومرجان، زمرد وفيروز وانواع اخرى من احجار هنديه، ويمنيه وحبشيه تجذب السياح وتخطف ابصارهم.\n\nالعطور والبخور\nوتسبح في الفضاء روائح جميله تصل الى السائح الذي يعبر الزقاق في اتجاه شارع الموسكي حيث تكثر تجاره العطور العربيه والاسيويه والاوروبيه، هنا عطر الملك، والعنبر، والياسمين والفل، مئات وربما الان زجاجات ذات اشكال والوان غريبه تحتوى عطوراً غير مالوفه تتراوح الوانها ما بين الزيتي في لون البترول الخام، والاصفر الذهبي، والبنفسجي الممزوج بالعنبر. ونسال تاجر يتحدى الزمن بابتسامه عن (الاسانس) الذي يتم تصنيع هذه العطور منه فقال ان ما اراه من عطور هنا يكاد يكون هو التركيبه الفعليه للعطر بدون اضافه كحول تذكر اليه، وناولني زجاجه تحتوي عطراً زيتي الملمس، فاقع الاريج وقال ان هذا العطر يتم استخلاصه من نوع معين من ذكور الغزال يسمى وعل المسك، اما هذا الذي يخلط لونه البنفسجي بعتامه تتالق تحت الضوء فهو خلاصه البنفسج، اما زيت العنبر فيفرزه نوع واحد من الحيتان يسمى حيتان العنبر، والحوت لايفرز هذا العنبر الا وهو يلفظ انفاسه الاخيره او يعانى سكرات الموت.\nاما البخور فله مملكه خاصه في الخان، ويعتقد الناس ان دخان المستكه يمنع العين والحسد، اما الكسبره فهي زعيمه مملكه البخور ويطلق عليها الناس اسم (الفك والفكوك) اي ان من يشمها تذهب عنه العقد بلا رجعه. اما زائر خان الخليلي فلابد ان تكون له رجعه.\n\nمعرض صور\nمراجع",

          "content": "Abu Mena (also spelled Abu Mina; Coptic: ⲁⲃⲃⲁ ⲙⲏⲛⲁ; Arabic: أبو مينا, romanized: Abū Mīnā  pronounced [æbuˈmæyːnæ]) was a town, monastery complex and Christian pilgrimage centre in Late Antique Egypt, about 50 km (31 mi) southwest of Alexandria, near New Borg El Arab city. Its remains were designated a World Heritage Site in 1979 for the site's importance in early Christianity. There are very few standing remains, but the foundations of most major buildings, such as the great basilica, are easily discernible.\nRecent agricultural efforts in the area have led to a significant rise in the water table, which has caused a number of the site's buildings to collapse or become unstable. The site was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 2001, and was finally removed from the list in 2025. Authorities were forced to place sand in the bases of buildings that are most endangered in the site.\n\nHistory\nMenas of Alexandria was martyred in the late 3rd or early 4th century (see Early Christianity). Various 5th-century and later accounts give slightly differing versions of his burial and the subsequent founding of his church. The essential elements are that his body was taken from Alexandria on a camel, which was led into the desert beyond Lake Mareotis. At some point, the camel refused to continue walking, despite all efforts to goad it. This was taken as a sign of divine will, and the body's attendants buried it on that spot.\nMost versions of the story state that the location of the tomb was then forgotten until its miraculous rediscovery by a local shepherd. From the Ethiopian Synaxarium (E.A.W. Budge, trans.):\n\nAnd God wished to reveal the [place of the] body of Saint Mînâs. And there was in that desert a certain shepherd, and one day a sheep which was suffering from the disease of the scab went to that place, and dipped himself in the water of the little spring which was near the place, and he rolled about in it and was healed straightway. And when the shepherd saw this thing, and understood the miracle, he marvelled exceedingly and was astonished. And afterwards he used to take some of the dust from that shrine, and mix it with water, and rub it on the sheep, and if they were ill with the scab, they were straightway healed thereby. And this he used to do at all times, and he healed all the sick who came to him by this means.\nWord of the shepherd's healing powers spread rapidly. The synaxarium describes Constantine I sending his sick daughter to the shepherd to be cured, and credits her with finding Menas' body, after which Constantine ordered the construction of a church at the site. (Some versions of the story replace Constantine with the late-5th century emperor Zeno, but archaeologists have dated the original foundation to the late 4th century). By the late 4th century, it was a significant pilgrimage site named Martyroupolis, where Christians sought healing and other miracles. Menas flasks are a particular type of small terracotta ampullae sold to pilgrims as containers for holy water or holy vigillamp-oil which are found very widely around the Western Mediterranean, dating roughly from the century and a half before the Muslim conquest.  They are cheaply made but impressed with images of the saint that are of significance in the study of iconography; it is presumed they were made around the city.\nDuring the reign of Arcadius, the local archbishop observed that crowds were overwhelming the small church. He wrote to the eastern emperor, who ordered a major expansion of the facilities, the first of three major church expansions which would eventually take place. By the end of Late antiquity, Abu Mena had become the leading pilgrimage site in Egypt.\nAround the mid-6th century, the port town of Philoxenite was established on the southern shore of Lake Mareotis to support pilgrimage to Abu Mena. Built on the ruins of a Roman settlement, it served as a transit hub fit equipped with rest houses where pilgrims could stay before continuing their journey. Its construction is believed to have been financed by Philoxenos, a prominent figure in Byzantine politics at the time.\nAbu Mena was destroyed during the early Muslim conquests of the mid-7th century.\n\nArchaeological excavations\nThe site was first excavated from 1905 to 1907. These efforts uncovered a large basilica church, an adjacent church which had probably housed the saint's remains, and Roman baths.\nA later, long-term series of excavations by the DAI ended in 1998. The most recent excavations uncovered a large dormitory for poor pilgrims, with separate wings for men and for women and children. A complex to the south of the great basilica was likely the residence of the hegoumenos, or abbot. Excavations suggest that the great xenodocheion, a reception area for pilgrims, may originally have been a cemetery. A baptistery, adjacent to the site of the original church, appears to have gone through at least three phases of development. Also uncovered was a complex of wine presses, including underground storage rooms, which dates to the 6th and 7th centuries.\n\nThreats\nThe site of Abu Mena was added to UNESCO's World Heritage in Danger list in 2001 due to the threat of rising local water tables. This rise in water is due to agricultural development programs aimed at reclaiming the land. The hard clay soil that surrounds the site can support buildings when dry. However, it becomes unstable when wet and has led to the collapse of cisterns and other structures about the ancient city. As the ground collapses, large cavities form enveloping the overlying structures. \nImmediate action was taken to fill the bases of particularly important sites with sand and close them off to the public. In attempts to counteract this phenomenon, the Supreme Council of Antiquities spent 45 million digging trenches and adding pumps in hopes of decreasing the pressure of irrigation. In addition, a fence was added to prevent encroachment and threat. These proved to be successful and the site was removed from UNESCO's World Heritage in Danger list in 2009.\nSince then, water has continued to rise and cause destruction of monuments. The site was once again added to UNESCO's World Heritage in Danger list, and finally removed in 2025. Factors found to negatively impact the property most recently in 2018 include housing, management activities, managements systems/plan, and water.\n\nConservation\nRecent conservation endeavors at the site of Abu Mena involve the implementation of advanced drainage systems and community engagement programs to mitigate the ongoing threats posed by rising water levels and other factors.\nThe Egyptian government has implemented emergency plans and indeed solved the problem with the water table, but the government does not currently have a thorough management plan or anything related to it. Since UNESCO requires a management plan for all the cultural and natural sites, several proposals have been made. The most reliable option is the use of a smart, sustainable membrane. It has been designed to solve issues with ventilation, energy, and water on the site. This plan involves building a dome-shaped smart membrane, which would provide the site an appropriate amount of airflow (as is required for every world heritage site). The smart-membrane dome would also provide a self-sustainable energy supply through solar cells located on the outside layer of the dome. The membrane would also be designed to have a filtration system for dehumidifying the air by filtering the water out of it so that the site can be better preserved.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of ancient Egyptian towns and cities\nChurch of Saint Menas (Cairo)\nSaint Fana\nSaint Mina Monastery in Mariut, the modern pilgrimage site, which borders the original Abu Mena site to the north\nWorld Heritage Sites in Danger\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\nO'Brien, Harriet (June 18, 2006). \"The World's Most Remarkable Buildings Under Threat\".

          "content": "Amarna (; Arabic: العمارنة, romanized: al-ʿAmārna) is an extensive ancient Egyptian archaeological site containing the ruins of Akhetaten, the capital city during the late Eighteenth Dynasty. The city was established in 1346 BC, built at the direction of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, and abandoned shortly after his death in 1332 BC.\nThe site is on the east bank of the Nile River, in what today is the Egyptian province of Minya. It is about 58 km (36 mi) south of the city of al-Minya, 312 km (194 mi) south of the Egyptian capital, Cairo, and 402 km (250 mi) north of Luxor (site of the previous capital, Thebes). The city of Deir Mawas lies directly to its west. On the east side of Amarna there are several modern villages, the chief of which are l-Till in the north and el-Hagg Qandil in the south.\nActivity in the region flourished from the Amarna Period until the later Roman era.\n\nName\nThe name Amarna comes from the Beni Amran tribe that lived in the region and founded a few settlements. The ancient Egyptian name means \"the horizon of the Aten\".\nEnglish Egyptologist Sir John Gardner Wilkinson visited Amarna twice in the 1820s and identified it as Alabastron, following the sometimes contradictory descriptions of Roman-era authors Pliny (On Stones) and Ptolemy (Geography), although he was not sure about the identification and suggested Kom el-Ahmar as an alternative location.\n\nCity of Akhetaten\nThe area of the city was effectively a virgin site, and it was this city that Akhetaten described as the Aten's \"seat of the First Occasion, which he had made for himself that he might rest in it\".\nIt may be that the Royal Wadi's resemblance to the hieroglyph for horizon showed that this was the place to found the city.\nThe city was built as the new capital of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, dedicated to his new religion of worship to the Aten. Construction started in or around Year 5 of his reign (1346 BC) and was probably completed by Year 9 (1341 BC), although it became the capital city two years earlier. To speed up construction of the city most of the buildings were constructed out of mudbrick, and white washed. The most important buildings were faced with local stone.\nIt is the only ancient Egyptian city which preserves great details of its internal plan in large part because it was abandoned almost completely shortly after the royal government of Tutankhamun quit the city in favor of Thebes (modern Luxor). The city seems to have remained active for a decade or so after his death, and a shrine to Horemheb indicates that it was at least partially occupied at the beginning of his reign,  if only as a source for building material elsewhere. Once it was abandoned, it remained uninhabited until Roman settlement began along the edge of the Nile. However, due to the unique circumstances of its creation and abandonment, it is questionable how representative of ancient Egyptian cities it actually is. Amarna was hastily constructed and covered an area of approximately 8 miles (13 km) of territory on the east bank of the Nile River; on the west bank, land was set aside to provide crops for the city's population. The entire city is encircled with a total of 14 boundary stelae (labeled A thru V with discontinuities left for those thought to be missing, Stele B was defaced by locals in 1885) detailing Akhenaten's conditions for the establishment of this new capital city of Egypt.\nThe earliest dated stele from Akhenaten's new city is known to be Boundary stele K which is dated to Year 5, IV Peret (or month 8), day 13 of Akhenaten's reign. (Most of the original 14 boundary stelae have been badly eroded.) It preserves an account of Akhenaten's foundation of this city. The document records the pharaoh's wish to have several temples of the Aten to be erected here, for several royal tombs to be created in the eastern hills of Amarna for himself, his chief wife Nefertiti, and his eldest daughter Meritaten as well as his explicit command that when he was dead, he would be brought back to Amarna for burial. Boundary stela K introduces a description of the events that were being celebrated at Amarna:\n\nHis Majesty mounted a great chariot of electrum, like the Aten when He rises on the horizon and fills the land with His love, and took a goodly road to Akhetaten, the place of origin, which [the Aten] had created for Himself that he might be happy therein. It was His son Wa'enrē [i.e. Akhenaten] who founded it for Him as His monument when His Father commanded him to make it. Heaven was joyful, the earth was glad every heart was filled with delight when they beheld him.\n\nThis text then goes on to state that Akhenaten made a great oblation to the god Aten \"and this is the theme [of the occasion] which is illustrated in the lunettes of the stelae where he stands with his queen and eldest daughter before an altar heaped with offerings under the Aten, while it shines upon him rejuvenating his body with its rays.\"\n\nSite and plan\nLocated on the east bank of the Nile, the ruins of the city are laid out roughly north to south along a \"Royal Road\", now referred to as \"Sikhet es-Sultan\". The Royal residences are generally to the north, in what is known as the North City, with a central administration and religious area and the south of the city is made up of residential suburbs.\n\nNorth City\nIf one approached the city of Amarna from the north by river the first buildings past the northern boundary stele would be the North Riverside Palace. This building ran all the way up to the waterfront and was likely the main residence of the royal family. Located within the North City area is the Northern Palace, the main residence of the royal family. Between this and the central city, the Northern Suburb was initially a prosperous area with large houses, but the house size decreased and became poorer the further from the road they were.\nThe North City was an administrative area. It contains the ruins of royal palaces, especially the Northern Palace and other administrative buildings and occupies an area between the river and the cliffs that terminate the plains to the north of the city itself.\n\nCentral City\nMost of the important ceremonial and administrative buildings were located in the central city. Here the Great Temple of the Aten and the Small Aten Temple were used for religious functions and between these the Great Royal Palace and Royal Residence were the ceremonial residence of the king and royal family, and were linked by a bridge or ramp. Located behind the Royal Residence was the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh, where the Amarna Letters were found.\nThis area was probably the first area to be completed, and had at least two phases of construction.\n\nSouthern suburbs\nTo the south of the city was the area now referred to as the Southern Suburbs. It contained the estates of many of the city's powerful nobles, including Nakhtpaaten (Chief Minister), Ranefer, Panehesy (High Priest of the Aten), and Ramose (Master of Horses). This area also held the studio of the sculptor Thutmose, where the famous bust of Nefertiti was found in 1912.\nFurther to the south of the city was Kom el-Nana, an enclosure, usually referred to as a sun-shade, and was probably built as a sun-temple., and then the Maru-Aten, which was a palace or sun-temple originally thought to have been constructed for Akhenaten's queen Kiya, but on her death her name and images were altered to those of Meritaten, his daughter.\n\nCity outskirts\nSurrounding the city and marking its extent, the Boundary Stelae (each a rectangle of carved rock on the cliffs on both sides of the Nile) describing the founding of the city are a primary source of information about it.\n\nAway from the city Akhenaten's Royal necropolis was started in a narrow valley to the east of the city, hidden in the cliffs. Only one tomb was completed, and was used by an unnamed Royal Wife, and Akhenaten's tomb was hastily used to hold him and likely Meketaten, his second daughter.\nIn the cliffs to the north and south of the Royal Wadi, the nobles of the city constructed their Tombs.\n\nLife in ancient Amarna/Akhetaten\nMuch of what is known about Amarna's founding is due to the preservation of a series of official boundary stelae (13 are known) ringing the perimeter of the city. These are cut into the cliffs on both sides of the Nile (10 on the east, 3 on the west) and record the events of Akhetaten (Amarna) from founding to just before its fall.\nTo make the move from Thebes to Amarna, Akhenaten needed the support of the military. Ay, one of Akhenaten's principal advisors, exercised great influence in this area because his father Yuya had been an important military leader. Additionally, everyone in the military had grown up together; they had been a part of the richest and most successful period in Egypt's history under Akhenaten's father, so loyalty among the ranks was strong and unwavering. Perhaps most importantly, \"it was a military whose massed ranks the king took every opportunity to celebrate in temple reliefs, first at Thebes and later at Amarna.\"\n\nReligious life\nWhile the reforms of Akhenaten are generally believed to have been oriented towards a sort of monotheism, or perhaps more accurately, monolatrism, archaeological evidence shows other deities were also revered, even at the centre of the Aten cult – if not officially, then at least by the people who lived and worked there.\n\n... at Akhetaten itself, recent excavation by Kemp (2008: 41–46) has shown the presence of objects that depict gods, goddesses and symbols that belong to the traditional field of personal belief. So many examples of Bes, the grotesque dwarf figure who warded off evil spirits, have been found, as well as of the goddess-monster, Taweret, part crocodile, part hippopotamus, who was associated with childbirth. Also in the royal workmen's village at Akhetaten, stelae dedicated to Isis and Shed have been discovered (Watterson 1984: 158 & 208).\n\nThe Amarna letters\nIn 1887, a local woman digging for sebakh uncovered a cache of over 300 cuneiform tablets (now commonly known as the Amarna Letters). These tablets recorded select diplomatic correspondence of the Pharaoh and were predominantly written in Akkadian, the lingua franca commonly used during the Late Bronze Age of the Ancient Near East for such communication. This discovery led to the recognition of the importance of the site, and led to a further increase in exploration.\n\nAmarna art-style\nThe Amarna art-style broke with long-established Egyptian conventions. Unlike the strict idealistic formalism of previous Egyptian art, it depicted its subjects more realistically. These included informal scenes, such as intimate portrayals of affection within the royal family or playing with their children, and no longer portrayed women as lighter coloured than men. The art also had a realism that sometimes borders on caricature.\nWhile the worship of Aten was later referred to as the Amarna heresy and suppressed, this art had a more lasting legacy.\n\nArchaeology\nThe first western mention of the city was made in 1714 by Claude Sicard, a French Jesuit priest who was travelling through the Nile Valley who described the site and made a crude sketch\nof Stela A. As with much of Egypt, it was visited by Napoleon's corps de savants in 1798–1799, who prepared the first detailed map of Amarna, which was subsequently published in Description de l'Égypte between 1821 and 1830.\nAfter this European exploration continued in 1824 when Sir John Gardiner Wilkinson explored and mapped the city remains. The copyist Robert Hay and his surveyor G. Laver visited the locality and uncovered several of the Southern Tombs from sand drifts, recording the reliefs in 1833. The copies made by Hay and Laver languish largely unpublished in the British Library, where an ongoing project to identify their locations is underway.\nThe Prussian expedition led by Richard Lepsius visited the site in 1843 and 1845, and recorded the visible monuments and topography of Amarna in two separate visits over a total of twelve days, using drawings and paper squeezes. The results included an improved map of the city. Despite being somewhat limited in accuracy, the engraved Denkmäler plates formed the basis for scholastic knowledge and interpretation of many of the scenes and inscriptions in the private tombs and some of the Boundary Stelae for the rest of the century. The records made by these early explorers teams are of immense importance since many of these remains were later destroyed or otherwise lost.\n\nBetween 1891 and 1892 Alessandro Barsanti and Urbain Bouriant partly cleared the robbed out king's tomb. In 1891 and 1892 Sir Flinders Petrie worked for one season at Amarna, working independently of the Egypt Exploration Fund. He excavated primarily in the Central City, investigating the Great Temple of the Aten, the Great Official Palace, the King's House, the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh, and several private houses. Although frequently amounting to little more than a sondage, Petrie's excavations revealed additional cuneiform tablets, the remains of several glass factories, and a great quantity of discarded faience, glass, and ceramic in sifting the palace rubbish heaps (including Mycenaean sherds). By publishing his results and reconstructions rapidly, Petrie was able to stimulate further interest in the site's potential.\n\nModern excavations\nThe copyist and artist Norman de Garis Davies published drawn and photographic descriptions of private tombs and boundary stelae from Amarna from 1903 to 1908.\nFrom 1907 until 1914 the Deutsche Orientgesellschaft expedition, led by Ludwig Borchardt, worked extensively throughout the North and South suburbs of the city. The first several years were spent doing\nsurvey work with excavation beginning in 1911. The famous bust of Nefertiti, now in Berlin's Ägyptisches Museum, was discovered amongst other sculptural artefacts in the workshop of the sculptor Thutmose. The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 terminated the German excavations.\nIn two seasons between 1923 and 1925 an Egypt Exploration Society expedition returned to excavation at Amarna under the direction of T.E. Peet, Sir Leonard Woolley, Henri Frankfort, Stephen Glanville, and John Pendlebury. Mary Chubb served as the digs administrator. The renewed investigations were focused on religious and royal structures. Their work resumed in\ntwo seasons between 1930 and 1932.\nExcavation resumed in the 1977 under with the Amarna Survey directed by Barry J. Kemp with the University of Cambridge and Amarna Expedition under Salvatore Garfi  under the auspices of the Egypt Exploration Society and continued until 1982. Work was curtailed at that point due to regional conditions but resumed in 1996 under the Amarna Project and still under the direction of Barry J. Kemp. In the 2000 season work also included the nearby arcaheologicl\nsite of Kom el-Nana and the start of a GPS survey of the region around Amarna. Much of the work during this period was at the house of the king's chief charioteer, Ranefer which had been partially excavated in 1921. A separate expedition led by Geoffrey Martin described and copied the reliefs from the Royal Tomb, later publishing its findings together with objects thought to have come from the tomb.\nExcavation at Amarna, under Amarna Project, continues to the present. Work includes excavation at a cemetery, close to the southern tombs of the Nobles and at several other cemeteries of private individuals.\n\nIn media\nFictional\nThe Painted Queen written by the famous Elizabeth Peters a.k.a. Barbara Mertz is the most recent installment to the Amelia Peabody novels after the author's passing in 2013. Elizabeth Peters was a school trained archaeologist, but was persuaded by her male colleagues that a woman was not to be an archaeologist, so \"she created characters based on those misogynistic Egyptologists...\" as stated by Sarah Parcak, a female archaeologist that specializes in remote sensing. The adventure stars a female archaeologist Amelia Peabody and the mystery of the missing Bust of Nefertiti. The Painted Queen takes place in the 1912, several years after the actual excavations at Amarna, when excavations in Egypt are solely European, local hires, or looters. Like all good mystery novels, there is humor, twists, and turns, and a predictable ending of a solved case.\nNefertiti by Michelle Moran is a historical fiction work that guides the reader from the perspective of Queen Nefertiti and her younger sister Mutnodjmet. The story follows the timeline from her time in Thebes to Amarna and after Akhenaten's death. Nefertiti was the Chief wife in Akhenaten's court or haram. Though she is well known by name, as many historical female role models, her story is often overlooked for masculine rulers. Michelle Moran webs her story of the queen and her sister with political secrets, loss of innocence, and female strength in a patriarchal society.\n\nNon-fictional\nThe City of Akhenaten and Nefertiti: Amarna and its People by Barry Kemp, discusses everything from the conception of Amarna to the abandonment of the city. Within the book are images that display art, architecture, and the city as it was (reconstructed) and now. It also has a short chapter written by Kemp in the book Cities That Shaped the Ancient World.\n\nMagazines\nIn the past years National Geographic and archaeological articles have published articles on Amarna, Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, or Nefertiti. Most of the article can be found in both the paperback or on the National Geographic website (currently the most recent article was published January 2021).\n\nOpera\nAkhnaten, act II, scene 3 (\"The City\") by Philip Glass describes the mandate from Akhenaten to build Akhetaten. In the English lines, it is consistently referred to as the \"City of the Horizon\".\n\nGallery\nNotes\nReferences\nAldred, Cyril (1988). Akhenaten: King of Egypt. London: Thames and Hudson.

          "summary": "Amarna (; Arabic: العمارنة, romanized: al-ʿAmārna) is an extensive ancient Egyptian archaeological site containing the ruins of Akhetaten, the capital city during the late Eighteenth Dynasty. The city was established in 1346 BC, built at the direction of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, and abandoned shortly after his death in 1332 BC.\nThe site is on the east bank of the Nile River, in what today is the Egyptian province of Minya. It is about 58 km (36 mi) south of the city of al-Minya, 312 km (194 mi) south of the Egyptian capital, Cairo, and 402 km (250 mi) north of Luxor (site of the previous capital, Thebes).

          "content": "Beni Ḥassan (Arabic: بني حسان \"sons of Ḥassān\") is a Bedouin Arab tribe which inhabits Western Sahara, Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria. It is one of the four sub-tribes of the Banu Maqil who emigrated in the 11th century from South Arabia to the Maghreb with the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym Arab tribes. In the 13th century, they took the Sanhaja territories in the southwest of the Sahara. In Morocco, they first settled, alongside their Maqil relatives, in the area between Tadla and the Moulouya River. The Sous Almohad governor called upon them for help against a rebellion in the Sous, and they resettled in and around that region. They later moved to what is today Mauritania, and from the 16th century onwards, they managed to push back all black peoples southwards to the Senegal Valley river. The Beni Hassan and other warrior Arab tribes dominated the Sanhaja Berber tribes of the area after the Char Bouba war of the 17th century. As a result, Arabs became the dominant ethnic group in Western Sahara and Mauretania. The Bani Hassan dialect of Arabic became used in the region and is still spoken, in the form of Hassaniya Arabic. The hierarchy established by the Beni Hassan tribe gave Mauritania much of its sociological character. That ideology has led to oppression, discrimination and even enslavement of other groups in Mauritania.\n\nOrigin\nBeni Hassan are one of the four sub-tribes of Beni Maqil who emigrated to the Maghreb in the 11th century. The exact origin of the Beni Maqil tribe is unknown, although it has been established that they most likely originated in South Arabia (Yemen). The Maqil claimed Hashemite descent from Ja'far ibn Abi Talib, while some Arabian genealogists categorized them as Hilalians. Ibn Khaldun said both of these versions are false and that Maqil is most likely an Arab nomadic group from Yemen.\nThe tradition of Beni Hassan states that they were descendants of Hasan ibn Ali, son of Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad's son-in-law and a leading figure in Shia Islam, although the Beni Hassan were Sunni Muslims. The Sahrawi nation includes the Beni Hassan as part of its founding peoples and Hassaniya Arabic as part of its national identity. There is also a Beni Hassan Bedouin tribe in northern Jordan.\n\nBeni Hassan's descendants and other tribes that arrived from Yemen in the 13th century are considered among the clean-blooded Arab tribes. For example, the Oulad Delim who trace their origin back to Beni Hassan are the most populous tribe in Western Sahara and consider themselves the cleanest blooded Arabs in the Sahel.\n\nHistory\nMigration to the Maghreb\nVarious sources point to the Maqil tribe as the origin from which the Beni Hassan tribe was formed. The Ma'qils entered the Maghreb during the wave of emigration of the Arabian tribes in the 11th century, and since then, they were situated in North Africa together with other Bedouin Arab tribes that migrated from the Arabian Peninsula such as the Banu Hilal and the Banu Sulaym, with whom they shared great skill as warriors and a destructive capacity for the nations they attacked.\nThe Bedouin tribes were sent into the Maghreb by the Fatimids to punish the Zirids for switching allegiance to the rival Abbasid Caliphate. They were compared to Mughal warriors centuries later. They adapted perfectly to the climatic desert conditions of the Maghreb, discovering the same way of life as in the Arabian Peninsula. The Banu Sulaym opposed the Maqil's arrival and fought them off. The Maqil later allied with the Banu Hilal and entered under their protection, which enabled them to wander in the Moroccan desert between the Moulouya River and Tafilalt oases.\nIn the 13th century, they occupied southern Algeria and dominated the oases of Tuat and Gourara. For some authors, at this point, the Maqil group had already disintegrated into different populations in the Maghreb and had given rise to the Beni Hassan along with other related groups.\n\nConquest of the Sanhaja\nThe Beni Hassan continued their expansion to the southwest and occupied Sanhaja lands in the 13th century after invading and defeating this Berber confederation with the Lamtuna, Masmuda, Djuddala, Gazula, Banu Warith, Lamta and Tuareg, in a group known as the Baranis in Western Sahara.\nThe Sanhaja has long had to pay tribute to the nomadic Bedouin Hassani invaders. The invasion was quick and effective and happened around the year 1250, by the end of the Almohad Caliphate, and also dominated the valleys of the Moulouya, Draa, Sous, as well as the Tafilalt oasis region.\n\nMigration to Morocco\nBy the mid-15th century, the Beni Hassan controlled a large part of the oases and Western Sahara. They crossed into the Atlas after taking advantage of the weakening Marinid Sultanate around 1460 and then they dominated the Haouz region of Marrakesh by the beginning of the 16th century. At the same time, a part of the Beni Hassan made its way to Mauritania. Other groups migrated north through Tafilalt to Fez or up the Sebou and Bou Regreg rivers, where some settled south of Rabat.\nThe Hassanis were represented in the Haouz of Marrakech by the Rahamna, who were brought north to respond to the military needs of the Saadian Sultanate in the early 16th century. Two of the prominent Hassani communities during the late 'Alawi period were the Jaysh al-Udaya and the Shabbanat. The former were invited by the sultan of Morocco Ismail Ibn Sharif (1672–1727), while the latter controlled Marrakesh when sultan Al-Rashid arrived to conquer it.\n\nChar Bouba War\nHistorical accounts report that these Hassani communities enriched themselves by collecting tolls from trade caravans and extorting farming and herding villages settled in the oases. They were accused of subjecting these territories to two centuries of looting and intermittent wars, but at the same time they point out that their families settled in the same towns that they attacked and subjugated. This took place during the Char Bouba War from 1644 to 1674, which after decades of confrontations ended up completely Arabizing the native Berber population, destroying their language and culture and giving rise to the contemporary Sahrawi people.\nThe Char Bouba War was led by Sidi Ibrahim Al Aroussi, son of the famous Cheikh Sidi Ahmed Al Aroussi (died in 1593, near to Smara, in Western Sahara). Al Aroussi, with his two sons Shanan Al Aroussi and Sidi Tounsi Al Aroussi, led a powerful force of the Beni Hassan, the Aroussi Army, to conquer the Berber Imarat in modern day Mauritania and gain access to Bilad as-Sudan (\"the Land of the Blacks\", in Senegal and Mali).\nIn 1673, Nasr al-Din began invaded Futa Tooro and the various Wolof states beyond the Senegal river. By focusing on the states south of the Senegal, Nasr al-Din avoided an early confrontation with the powerful Beni Hassan. Nasr al-Din's focus on these states gained him control of the entrepôts for the gum trade along the Senegal. French trade on the Senegal had seen large growth since the beginning of the century, and thus control of the entrepôts strengthened Nasr al-Din financially, whilst offsetting the Hassan control of the trade to the ports on the Saharan coast.\nThe Beni Hassan were united in their opposition to Nasr al-Din. Most of the burden of fighting fell to the Emirate of Trarza, although the Emirate of Brakna sent Trarza reinforcements and helped immobilise Zawaya in their own regions to prevent them from joining the forces of Nasr. Most Zawaya of the Southern Sahara sided with Nasr, although some remained neutral, and others supported the Beni Hassan, with a Zawaya scholar from Shinqit issuing a fatwa against Nasr, stating that he was not a Caliph and had no right to impose the zakat. This fatwa led to Hãdi, the Trarza chief, sending troops to seize animals that had already been sent as zakat.\nIn 1674, the Beni Hassan defeated the Marabout Berbers, and after achieving political and military hegemony in the area, they founded the emirates of Trarza, Brakna, Tagant, Adrar and Hodh. The marabouts were Berbers who followed the Islamic doctrine of Nasr al-Din imposed in Senegal in the mid-17th century. The war ended in defeat for the Berber tribes, and they were from that point on forced to surrender their arms and submit to the warrior Arab tribes, to whom they paid the horma tributary tax. They would remain in roles as either exploited semi-sedentary agriculturalists and fishermen (znaga tribes), or, higher up on the social ladder, as religious (marabout or zawiya) tribes. This division between Hassane Arab warriors and Berber marabouts, plus the subordinate znaga, existed in Mauritania up until the French colonization, when France imposed itself militarily on all tribes, and so broke the power of the Hassane. Still, the traditional roles of the tribes remain important socially in these areas.\n\nBefore French colonization\nFollowing the pre-Islamic tradition of tribal warfare between clans in the Arabian Peninsula, the new Hassani emirates repeatedly went to war with each other. Throughout the 18th century, they harassed the Wolof in Senegal. Throughout this period, they spread their dialect and culture throughout the desert area of Western Sahara. In the 19th century, they led the consolidation of the process of cultural and linguistic Arabization of Mauritania.

          "summary": "Beni Ḥassan (Arabic: بني حسان \"sons of Ḥassān\") is a Bedouin Arab tribe which inhabits Western Sahara, Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria. It is one of the four sub-tribes of the Banu Maqil who emigrated in the 11th century from South Arabia to the Maghreb with the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym Arab tribes. In the 13th century, they took the Sanhaja territories in the southwest of the Sahara. In Morocco, they first settled, alongside their Maqil relatives, in the area between Tadla and the Moulouya River. The Sous Almohad governor called upon them for help against a rebellion in the Sous, and they resettled in and around that region. They later moved to what is today Mauritania, and from the 16th century onwards, they managed to push back all black peoples southwards to the Senegal Valley river. The Beni Hassan and other warrior Arab tribes dominated the Sanhaja Berber tribes of the area after the Char Bouba war of the 17th century. As a result, Arabs became the dominant ethnic group in Western Sahara and Mauretania. The Bani Hassan dialect of Arabic became used in the region and is still spoken, in the form of Hassaniya Arabic. The hierarchy established by the Beni Hassan tribe gave Mauritania much of its sociological character. That ideology has led to oppression, discrimination and even enslavement of other groups in Mauritania.",

          "content": "Wadi El Natrun (Arabic: وادي النطرون, lit. 'Valley of Natron'; Coptic: Ϣⲓϩⲏⲧ, romanized: Šihēt, lit. 'measure of the hearts') is a depression in northern Egypt that is located 23 m (75 ft) below sea level and 38 m (125 ft) below the Nile River level. The valley contains several alkaline lakes, natron-rich salt deposits, salt marshes and freshwater marshes.\nIn Christian literature it is usually known as Scetis (Σκήτις  in Hellenistic Greek) or  Skete (Σκήτη, plural Σκήτες in ecclesiastical Greek). \nIt is one of the three early Christian monastic centers located in the Nitrian Desert of the northwestern Nile Delta. The other two monastic centers are Nitria and Kellia. Scetis, now called Wadi El Natrun, is best known today because its ancient monasteries remain in use, unlike Nitria and Kellia which have only archaeological remains. The desertified valley around Scetis in particular may be called the Desert of Scetis.\n\nGeography\nWadi al-Natrun is the common name for a desert valley located west of the Nile Delta, along the El Tahrir markaz, which is about 10 km west of the entrance to Sadat City on the Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road, and about 50 km from Khattabah on the Nile (Rashid Branch), and it falls below the level of the plateau surface surrounding it about 50 meters. The length of this depression ranges between 5, 55 and 60 km, while its average width is 10 km, and its deepest point reaches 24 meters below sea level. The depression is the smallest depression in the Egyptian Western Desert, with an area of about 500 km2. Therefore, it is true that it is a depression and not a valley, because the region is a closed depression that has a beginning and an end, and it has no source, estuary or tributaries, so the launch of the word \"Wadi\" on the depression is not topographically correct.\nThe Wadi contains 12 lakes, the total surface area of which is 10 km square and their average depth is only 2 m. The color of these lakes is reddish blue because its water is saturated with the Natron salt.\n\nHistory\nFossil discoveries\nFossils dating to the Pliocene era (5.3-2.6 million years ago) have been discovered in the Wadi El Natrun region, including the long-snouted crocodile Euthecodon, softshell turtles, the camel Paracamelus, the three toed hipparionine equine Cormohipparion, the primitive hippopotamus Archaeopotamus andrewsi, antelope including reedbuck (Renunca) and Alcelaphinae, and the elephant-relative Deinotherium.\n\nAncient history\nNatron valley is first attested in the story of the Eloquent Peasant, and it is mentioned among the list of seven oases in the Temple of Edfu. In Ptolemaic times it constituted part of the Nitrite nome (Ancient Greek: Νιτριώτης νομός). It was also known in Coptic as Mountain of Salt (Coptic: ⲡⲧⲱⲟⲩ ⲙⲡϩⲙⲟⲩ) or Phanihosem (Coptic: ⲫⲁⲛⲓϩⲟⲥⲉⲙ, lit. 'the one (place) on the natron').\nThe importance of the Natrun valley dates back to the Pharaonic era, as the ancient Egyptians and the Libyans fought many battles there. And this ended up with the Egyptians overcoming them and annexed the eastern side of the desert, which still belongs to Egypt. Then, Wadi al-Natrun became an administrative part of the country in the Pharaonic era, but there is no information about its history during their reign, and the latest writings on the wars between the Libu and the Egyptians indicate that the last of them was in 1170 BC during the reign of Ramesses III.\nAs for the religious significance of Wadi al-Natrun, there are many discoveries that indicate that this area was considered sacred as early as year 2000 BCE at the very least. Among these discoveries is a bust of black granite dating back to the era of the Seventeenth Dynasty of the Pharaohs, and there is also a granite gate and stones from the lintel of a door bearing cartridges for King Amenemhat I, in a place called the backbone.\n\nEconomic history\nThe alkali lakes of the Natron Valley provided the Ancient Egyptians with the sodium bicarbonate used in mummification and in Egyptian faience, and later by the Romans as a flux for glass making.\nThe Egyptian Salt and Soda Company Railway was built at the end of the 19th century as a 33 miles (54 km) long narrow gauge railway with a gauge of 750 mm, which attracted the first tourists to the wadi.\n\nMonastic history\nThe desolate region became one of Christianity's most sacred areas. The Desert Fathers and cenobitic monastic communities used the desert's solitude and privations to develop self-discipline (asceticism). Hermit monks believed that desert life would teach them to eschew the things of this world and follow God's call. Between the 4th and 7th century AD, hundreds of thousands of people from the world over joined the hundreds of Christian monasteries in the Nitrian Desert, centered on Nitria, Kellia and Scetis (Wadi El Natrun).\nSaint Macarius of Egypt first came to Scetis (Wadi El Natrun) around 330 AD where he established a solitary monastic site. His reputation attracted a loose band of anchorites, hermits and monks who settled nearby in individual cells. Many of them came from nearby Nitria and Kellia where they had previous experience in solitary desert living; thus the earliest cenobitic communities were a loose consolidation of like-minded monks.  By the end of the fourth century, four distinct communities had developed: Baramus, Macarius, Bishoi and John Kolobos. At first these communities were groupings of cells centered on a communal church and facilities, but enclosed walls and watchtowers developed over time and in response to raids from desert nomads. Nitria, Kellia, and Scellis also experienced internal fractures related to doctrinal disputes in Egypt. At its peak the place contained 700 monasteries. The monasteries flourished during the Muslim conquest of Egypt (639–642), but in the eighth and ninth centuries taxation and administration concerns led to conflicts with the Muslim government.\n\nInvasion of Scetis\nScetis was attacked by the Mazices who \"came sweeping off the Libyan desert\" in 407-408 AD and was decimated, causing many notable Desert Fathers to leave the region, such as Abba Anoub. One of the survivors, St. Arsenius the Great, remarked in 410 that, \"The world has lost Rome and the monks have lost Scetis.\" As the Jesuit historian and Professor Willian J. Harmless said, \"Scetis’s destruction marked a turning point in the history of early Christian monasticism. The site would be resettled a few years later, and in fact would suffer other raids, notably in 434, 444, and 570.\"\nNitria and Kellia were eventually abandoned in the 7th and 9th centuries respectively, but Scetis continued throughout the Medieval period. Although some of the individual monasteries were eventually abandoned or destroyed, four have remained in use to the present day:\n\nMonastery of Saint Macarius the Great\nParomeos Monastery\nMonastery of Saint Pishoy\nSyrian Monastery\nSome of the most renowned saints of the region include the various Desert Fathers, including Saint Amun, Saint Arsenius, Saint John Cassian, Saint Isidore of Scété, Saint John the Dwarf, Saint Macarius of Egypt, Saint Macarius of Alexandria, Saint Moses the Black, Saint Pishoy, Sts. Maximos and Domatios, Saint Poimen The Great and Saint Samuel the Confessor.\nTo this day Wadi El Natrun remains the most important center of Coptic monasticism.\n\nSaint-Exupéry's plane crash\nThe environs of Wadi Natrun have been identified as the likely site of where the plane of French \naviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry crashed on December 30, 1935.  After miraculously surviving the crash, he and his plane's mechanic nearly died of thirst before being rescued by a nomad. Saint-Exupéry documented his experience in his book Wind, Sand and Stars. The event is thought to have inspired his most famous work, The Little Prince.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nSkete\nDoor of Prophecies\nPikrolimni (lake)\nPachomian monasteries\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nM.

          "content": "Tanis ( TAY-niss; Ancient Greek: Τάνις [tánis]; Latin: Tanis ['tanɪs]) or San al-Hagar (Arabic: صان الحجر, romanized: Ṣān al-Ḥaǧar; Ancient Egyptian: ḏꜥn.t [ˈcʼuʕnat]; Akkadian: 𒍝𒀪𒉡, romanized: Ṣaʾnu; Coptic: ϫⲁⲛⲓ or ϫⲁⲁⲛⲉ or ϫⲁⲛⲏ; Biblical Hebrew: צֹעַן‎, romanized: Ṣōʿan) is the Greek name for ancient Egyptian ḏꜥn.t, an important archaeological site in the northeastern Nile Delta of Egypt, and the location of a city of the same name. Tanis was the capital of the Egyptian Kingdom in its 21st and 22nd Dynasties. It is located on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, which has long since silted up.\n\nHistory\nTanis is unattested before the 19th Dynasty of Egypt, when it was the capital of the 14th nome of Lower Egypt. A temple inscription datable to the reign of Ramesses II mentions a \"Field of Tanis\", while the city in se is securely attested in two 20th Dynasty documents: the Onomasticon of Amenope and the Story of Wenamun, as the home place of the pharaoh-to-be Smendes.\nThe earliest known Tanite buildings are datable to the 21st Dynasty. Although some monuments found at Tanis are datable earlier than the 21st Dynasty, most of these were in fact brought there from nearby cities, mainly from the previous capital of Pi-Ramesses, for reuse. Indeed, at the end of the New Kingdom the royal residence of Pi-Ramesses was abandoned because the Pelusiac branch of the Nile in the Delta became silted up and its harbour consequently became unusable.\nAfter Pi-Ramesses' abandonment, Tanis became the seat of power of the pharaohs of the 21st Dynasty, and later of the 22nd Dynasty (along with Bubastis). The rulers of these two dynasties supported their legitimacy as rulers of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt with traditional titles and building works, although they pale compared to those at the height of the New Kingdom. A remarkable achievement of these kings was the building and subsequent expansions of the Great temple of Amun-Ra at Tanis (at the time, Amun-Ra replaced Seth as the main deity of the eastern Delta), while minor temples were dedicated to Mut and Khonsu whom, along with Amun-Ra, formed the Theban Triad. The intentional emulation towards Thebes is further stressed by the fact that these gods bore their original Theban epithets, leading to Thebes being more commonly mentioned than Tanis itself. Furthermore, the new royal necropolis at Tanis successfully replaced the one in the Theban Valley of the Kings.\nAfter the 22nd Dynasty Tanis lost its status of royal residence, but became in turn the capital of the 19th nome of Lower Egypt. Starting from the 30th Dynasty, Tanis experienced a new phase of building development which endured during the Ptolemaic Period. It remained populated until its abandonment in Roman times.\nIn Late Antiquity, it was the seat of the bishops of Tanis, who adhered to the Coptic Orthodox Church.\nBy the time of John of Nikiû in the 7th century, Tanis appears to have already declined significantly, as it was grouped together with four other towns under a single prefect.\nThe 1885 Census of Egypt recorded San el-Hagar as a nahiyah in the district of Arine in Sharqia Governorate; at that time, the population of the city was 1,569 (794 men and 775 women).\n\nStudies and excavations\nThe first study of Tanis dates to 1798 during the French invasion of Egypt and Syria. Pierre Jacotin, a French engineer, drew up a map of the site in the Description de l'Égypte. It was first excavated in 1825 by Jean-Jacques Rifaud, who discovered the two pink granite sphinxes now in the Musée du Louvre. He was followed by François Auguste Ferdinand Mariette who excavated between 1860 and 1864. William Matthew Flinders Petrie oversaw excavation from 1883 to 1886. The work was taken over by Pierre Montet from 1929 to 1956, who discovered the royal necropolis dating to the Third Intermediate Period in 1939. The Mission française des fouilles de Tanis (MFFT) has been studying the site since 1965 under the direction of Jean Yoyotte and Philippe Brissaud, and François Leclère since 2013.\nThere has been much debate over whether or not Tanis could be the biblical city of Zoan in which the Hebrews would have suffered pharaonic slavery. Pierre Montet, in inaugurating his great excavation campaigns in the 1930s, began from the same premise. He was hoping to discover traces that would confirm the accounts of the Old Testament. His own excavations gradually overturned this hypothesis, even if he was defending this biblical connection until the end of his life. It was not until the discovery of Qantir/Pi-Ramesses and the resumption of excavations under Jean Yoyotte that the place of Tanis was finally restored in the long chronology of the sites of the delta.\n\nRuins\nThough Tanis was briefly explored in the early 19th century, the first large-scale archaeological excavations there were made by Auguste Mariette in the 1860s. In 1866, Karl Richard Lepsius discovered a copy of the Canopus Decree, an inscription in both Greek and Egyptian, at Tanis. Unlike the Rosetta Stone, discovered 67 years earlier, this inscription included a full hieroglyphic text, thus allowing a direct comparison of the Greek text to the hieroglyphs and confirming the accuracy of Jean-François Champollion's approach to deciphering hieroglyphs.\nDuring the subsequent century the French carried out several excavation campaigns directed by Pierre Montet, then by Jean Yoyotte and subsequently by Philippe Brissaud. For some time the overwhelming amount of monuments bearing the cartouches of Ramesses II or Merenptah led archaeologists to believe that Tanis and Pi-Ramesses were in fact the same. Furthermore, the discovery of the Year 400 Stela at Tanis led to the speculation that Tanis should also be identified with the older, former Hyksos capital, Avaris. The later re-discovery of the actual, neighbouring archaeological sites of Pi-Ramesses (Qantir) and Avaris (Tell el-Dab'a) made clear that the earlier identifications were incorrect, and that all the Ramesside and pre-Ramesside monuments at Tanis were in fact brought here from Pi-Ramesses or other cities.\n\nThere are ruins of a number of temples, including the chief temple dedicated to Amun, and a very important royal necropolis of the Third Intermediate Period (which contains the only known intact royal pharaonic burials, the tomb of Tutankhamun having been entered in antiquity). The burials of three pharaohs of the 21st and 22nd Dynasties – Psusennes I, Amenemope and Shoshenq II – survived the depredations of tomb robbers throughout antiquity. They were discovered intact in 1939 and 1940 by Pierre Montet and proved to contain a large catalogue of gold, jewelry, lapis lazuli and other precious stones, as well as the funerary masks of these kings.\nToday, the main parts of the temple dedicated to Amun-Ra can still be distinguished by the presence of large obelisks that marked the various pylons as in other Egyptian temples. Now fallen to the ground and lying in a single direction, they may have been knocked down by a violent earthquake during the Byzantine era. They form one of the most notable aspects of the Tanis site. Archaeologists have counted more than twenty.\nThe chief deities of Tanis were Amun; his consort, Mut; and their child Khonsu, forming the Tanite triad. This triad was, however, identical to that of Thebes, leading many scholars to speak of Tanis as the northern Thebes.\nIn 2009, the Egyptian Culture Ministry reported archaeologists had discovered a sacred lake in the temple of Mut at Tanis. The lake, built out of limestone blocks, had been 15 meters long and 5 meters deep. It was discovered 12 meters below ground in good condition. The lake could have been built during the late 25th–early 26th Dynasty.\nIn 2011, analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery, led by archaeologist Sarah Parcak of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, found numerous related mud-brick walls, streets, and large residences, amounting to an entire city plan, in an area that appears blank under normal images. A French archeological team selected a site from the imagery and confirmed mud-brick structures approximately 30 cm below the surface. However, the assertion that the technology showed 17 pyramids was denounced as \"completely wrong\" by the Minister of State for Antiquities at the time, Zahi Hawass.\n\nNotable finds and artifacts\nIn Montet and other later archaeologists excavations of Tanis, many important and unique artifacts were found. When the sealed tombs of kings Psusennes I, Amenemope, and Shoshenq II, were opened by Montet, all three were discovered with their tombs completely intact with all of the original funerary offerings. All three kings were still adorned with their golden and gilded funerary masks - a rarity.\nAnother artifact is the Pectoral of King Amenemope, a piece of jewelry he would have worn hung around his neck on his chest. The icon depicts the godesses Isis and Nephthys holding a lapis lazuli scarab with the cartouche of Amenemope.\nIn the tomb of General Wendjebauendjed, the High Priest of Khonsu at Tanis, a series of bowls and cups made of gold were found by Montet. One of the golden bowls has a polychrome glass rosette of a flower at the center. The rosette is \"is thought... [to represent] the Unification of the Two Lands by combining the emblems of papyrus and lotus that are the two symbols of Upper and Lower Egypt.\"\n\nCultural references\nThe Biblical story of Moses being found in the marshes of the Nile River (Book of Exodus, Exodus 2:3–5) is often set at Tanis, which is often identified with Zoan (Hebrew: צֹועַן Ṣōʕan).\nIn the 1981 Indiana Jones film Raiders of the Lost Ark, Tanis is fictitiously portrayed as a lost city which was buried in antiquity by a massive sandstorm, before being rediscovered by a Nazi expedition looking for the Ark of the Covenant.\nThe Tanis fossil site, which may preserve unique remains from the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, is named after the city. The paleontologist Robert de Palma chose the name based on the significance of Tanis in the decipherment of hieroglyphs, as well as its role in Raiders of the Lost Ark as the hiding place of the Ark of the Covenant.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of ancient Egyptian towns and cities\nList of ancient Egyptian sites, including sites of temples\nList of historical capitals of Egypt\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAssociation française d’Action artistique. 1987.

          "content": "Bubastis (Bohairic Coptic: Ⲡⲟⲩⲃⲁⲥϯ Poubasti; Greek: Βούβαστις Boubastis or Βούβαστος Boubastos), also known in Arabic as Tell-Basta or in Egyptian as Per-Bast, was an ancient Egyptian city. Bubastis is often identified with the biblical Pi-Beseth (Hebrew: פי-בסת py-bst, Ezekiel 30:17). It was the capital of its own nome, located along the River Nile in the Delta region of Lower Egypt, and notable as a center of worship for the feline goddess Bastet, and therefore the principal depository in Egypt of mummies of cats. \nIts ruins are located in the suburbs of the modern city of Zagazig.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of Bubastis in Egyptian is Pr-Bȝst.t, conventionally pronounced Per-Bast but its Earlier Egyptian pronunciation can be reconstructed as /ˈpaɾu-buˈʀistit/. It is a compound of Egyptian pr (“house\") and the name of the goddess Bastet; thus the phrase means \"House of Bast\". In later forms of Egyptian, sound shifts had altered the pronunciation. In Bohairic Coptic, the name is rendered Ⲡⲟⲩⲃⲁⲥϯ, Ⲡⲟⲩⲁⲥϯ or Ⲃⲟⲩⲁⲥϯ.\n\nHistory\nBubastis served as the capital of the nome of Am-Khent, the 18th nome of Lower Egypt. Bubastis was situated southwest of Tanis, upon the eastern side of the Pelusiac branch of the Nile. The nome and city of Bubastis were allotted to the Calasirian division of the Egyptian war-caste.\n\nSecond Dynasty\nIn a later account by the Greek historian Manetho, it's stated that a \"chasm opened near Bubastis and many perished\" during the reign of Hotepsekhemwy in the Second Dynasty.\n\nTwelfth Dynasty\nIn the Middle Kingdom, Tell Basta was the site of a large mudbrick palace (16,000 sqm) dated to the Twelfth Dynasty. It has been thought to be a residence of Amenemhat III. A limestone lintel shows the king during his Heb Sed Festival.\n\nSecond Intermediate Period\nFollowing the Twelfth Dynasty, the Middle Kingdom faded out. At Bubastis, a red granite architrave belonged to Sekhemre Khutawy Khabaw. In another monument found at Tanis, he is mentioned along with Hor.\n\nTwenty-Second Dynasty\nIt became a royal residence after Shoshenq I, the first ruler and founder of the 22nd Dynasty, became pharaoh in 943 BC. Bubastis was its height during this dynasty and the 23rd. It declined after the conquest by Cambyses II in 525 BC, which heralded the end of the Saite 26th Dynasty and the start of the Achaemenid Empire.\nThe Twenty Second Dynasty of Egyptian monarchs consisted of nine, or, according to Eusebius of three Bubastite kings, and during their reigns the city was one of the most considerable places in the Delta. Immediately to the south of Bubastis were the allotments of land with which Psamtik I rewarded the services of his Ionian and Carian mercenaries; and on the northern side of the city commenced the Canal of the Pharaohs, which Pharaoh Necho II began (but never finished) to go between the Nile and the Red Sea.\n\nPersian rule and decline\nAfter Bubastis was taken by the Persians, its walls were dismantled. From this period it gradually declined, although it appears in ecclesiastical annals among the episcopal sees of the province Augustamnica Secunda. Bubastite coins of the age of Hadrian exist.\nThe following is the description which Herodotus gives of Bubastis, as it appeared shortly after the period of the Persian invasion, 525 BC, and Hamilton remarks that the plan of the ruins remarkably warrants the accuracy of this historical eye-witness:\n\nTemples there are more spacious and costlier than that of Bubastis, but none so pleasant to behold. It is after the following fashion. Except at the entrance, it is surrounded by water: for two canals branch off from the river, and run as far as the entrance to the temple: yet neither canal mingles with the other, but one runs on this side, and the other on that. Each canal is a hundred feet wide, and its banks are lined with trees. The propylaea are sixty feet in height, and are adorned with sculptures (probably intaglios in relief) nine feet high, and of excellent workmanship. The Temple being in the middle of the city is looked down upon from all sides as you walk around; and this comes from the city having been raised, whereas the temple itself has not been moved, but remains in its original place. Quite round the temple there goes a wall, adorned with sculptures. Within the inclosure is a grove of fair tall trees, planted around a large building in which is the effigy (of Bast). The form of that temple is square, each side being a stadium in length. In a line with the entrance is a road built of stone about three stadia long, leading eastwards through the public market. The road is about 400 feet (120 m) broad, and is flanked by exceeding tall trees. It leads to the temple of Hermes.\n\nReligion\nBubastis was a center of worship for the feline goddess Bastet, sometimes called Bubastis after the city, who the Greeks identified with Artemis. The cat was the sacred and peculiar animal of Bast, who is represented with the head of a cat or a lioness and frequently accompanies the deity Ptah in monumental inscriptions. The tombs at Bubastis were accordingly the principal depository in Egypt of the mummies of the cat.\nThe most distinguished features of the city and nome of Bubastis were its oracle of Bast, the splendid temple of that goddess and the annual procession in honor of her. The oracle gained in popularity and importance after the influx of Greek settlers into the Delta, since the identification of Bast with Artemis attracted to her shrine both native Egyptians and foreigners.\nThe festival of Bubastis was considered the most joyous and gorgeous of all in the Egyptian calendar as described by Herodotus:\n\nBarges and river craft of every description, filled with men and women, floated leisurely down the Nile. The men played on pipes of lotus. the women on cymbals and tambourines, and such as had no instruments accompanied the music with clapping of hands and dances, and other joyous gestures. Thus did they while on the river: but when they came to a town on its banks, the barges were made fast, and the pilgrims disembarked, and the women sang, playfully mocked the women of that town and threw their clothes over their head. When they reached Bubastis, then held they a wondrously solemn feast: and more wine of the grape was drank in those days than in all the rest of the year. Such was the manner of this festival: and, it is said, that as many as seven hundred thousand pilgrims have been known to celebrate the Feast of Bast at the same time.\n\nChristian bishopric\nExtant documents mention the names of three Christian bishops of Bubastis of the 4th and 5th centuries:\n\nHarpocration, one of the bishops ordained by Melitius of Lycopolis listed in 325\nHermon, a contemporary of Athanasius of Alexandria, in about 362\nIulianus at the Second Council of Ephesus in 449\n\nExcavations\nThe tomb of the late New Kingdom vizier Iuty was discovered in December 1964 in the \"Cemetery of the Nobles\" of Bubastis by the Egyptian archaeologist Shafik Farid.\nSince 2008, the German-Egyptian \"Tell Basta Project\" has been conducting excavations at Bubastis. Previously, in March 2004, a well preserved copy of the Decree of Canopus was discovered in the city.\n\nSee also\nList of ancient Egyptian towns and cities\n\nReferences\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.
