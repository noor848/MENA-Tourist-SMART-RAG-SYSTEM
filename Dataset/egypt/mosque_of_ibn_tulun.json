      "content": "The Mosque of Ibn Tulun (Arabic: مسجد إبن طولون, romanized: Masjid Ibn Ṭūlūn) is a mosque in Islamic Cairo, Egypt. Built between 876 and 879 CE by its namesake, Ahmad ibn Tulun, it is the oldest well-preserved mosque in Egypt. Its design was inspired by the 9th-century mosques of Samarra in Iraq, the Abbasid capital at the time, making it an important representative of classical Abbasid architecture. It is one of the most significant monuments of Islamic architecture in Egypt.\nThe mosque consists of a large open courtyard surrounded by roofed sections that are divided into aisles by rows of pointed arches. The arches are decorated with carved stucco, though not all of the original decoration has been preserved. The mosque is surrounded by an outer enclosure, the ziyada. The minaret, which has an unusual form with an external spiral staircase, stands in this enclosure. Various additions and restorations were made after the 9th century, including an important renovation by the Mamluk sultan Lajin in 1296. The present-day fountain and domed kiosk in the center of the courtyard date from this restoration. In addition to the main mihrab (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer), the prayer hall contains several flat stucco mihrabs added in different periods. After a period of severe neglect in the 19th century, during which the building was converted to other uses, the mosque was restored in the 20th century.\n\nHistory\nConstruction and early history\nThe mosque was commissioned by Ahmad ibn Tulun, the Abbasid governor of Egypt from 868 to 884. He was able to establish himself as a de facto autonomous ruler over Egypt and parts of the Levant. In 870, he began construction on a new administrative capital, al-Qata'i. It was located a short distance to the northwest of Fustat (the first Muslim capital of Egypt and its main city) and al-'Askar (the second capital built nearby by the Abbasids).\nThe Ibn Tulun Mosque was built to serve as al-Qata'i's congregational mosque. It was the third congregational mosque to be built in what is now Cairo, after the Mosque of 'Amr and the main mosque of al-'Askar. The medieval historian al-Maqrizi states that its construction started in 876 CE, while an original inscription slab found in the mosque identifies the date of completion as Ramadan 265 AH, corresponding to April–May 879 CE. According to Balawi, a 10th-century author, the architect of the mosque was a man named al-Nasrani, a non-Muslim, possibly Christian, who had previously designed the Aqueduct of Basatin, another of Ibn Tulun's construction projects in the area.\nThe mosque was constructed on a small hill called Gebel Yashkur, \"The Hill of Thanksgiving.\" One local legend says that it is here that Noah's Ark came to rest after the Deluge, rather than at Mount Ararat. Ibn Tulun's administrative palace, the Dar al-Imara, adjoined the mosque directly on its southeastern side, behind the qibla wall. Ibn Tulun was able to enter his mosque directly from the Dar al-Imara via a doorway that can still be seen to the right of the mihrab (niche symbolizing the qibla).\nAl-Qata'i was eventually razed to the ground in 905 by the Abbasid general Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib, who was sent to retake control of Egypt. Only the mosque and the adjoining Dar al-Imara were left standing. The mosque was spared because of its religious function while the palace was re-used by the subsequent Ikhshidid governors as an administrative center. Today, the mosque is the only surviving monument of this city.\n\nLater history\nThe mosque and the palace continued to see some use during the Fatimid period (after 969) and the Fatimid caliph al-Hafiz is recorded as having ordered some construction in the mosque in 1132, though it is unclear what work was done. The original fountain (fawara) in the center of the mosque's courtyard, which had previously burned down, was rebuilt on the orders of Caliph al-'Aziz in 995. The mosque and the area around it declined further in the following century. Part of the mosque was burned during riots in 1067. Badr al-Jamali (d. 1094), the powerful Fatimid vizier, restored the mosque, as indicated by the inscription he placed above what is still the main entrance to the mosque today. Badr al-Jamali's son and successor, al-Afdal Shahinshah, added a flat stucco mihrab to one of the prayer hall's piers in 1094.\n\nBy the 12th century, the mosque was being used as a caravanserai for North African pilgrims on their way to the Hijaz. After the assassination of the Mamluk sultan Al-Ashraf Khalil (r. 1290–1293), one of the accomplices in the murder, Lajin, hid inside the mosque, by which time the building had fallen into ruin. Mamluk-era writers report that Lajin hid inside the ruins of the original minaret, spent a miserable year there, and vowed that if God saved him and allowed him to become sultan he would restore the mosque. When he later became sultan (r. 1296–1299), he fulfilled this pledge and initiated a major restoration of the mosque in 1296. Lajin's works, many of which remain today, included renovating the main mihrab's decoration, building the dome in front of it, adding a new wooden minbar (pulpit), renovating the minaret, and building the present-day fountain in the center of the courtyard and the domed structure over it.\nIn 1524, a zawiya (Sufi convent) and tomb were built next to the minaret and are mentioned by historical sources as associated with a founder named either Sheikh Sharaf al-Din al-Madini or Sheikh al-Bushi. Its ruined remains were demolished in 1943.\nAt some point during the reign of Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century, the mosque was turned into a military hospital and then a salt warehouse. A blacksmith workshop was also installed in it. In 1846, Clot Bey received permission from Muhammad Ali to convert it into a mental asylum and sometime after this it became a poorhouse. During the conversion, Clot Bey ordered some of the arches around the mosque's courtyard to be walled up, an act which was criticized as vandalism by some 19th-century writers who visited the site afterwards.\n\nAs a result of these different uses, the building deteriorated severely in the 19th century  Some of the arches of the prayer hall along the courtyard façade collapsed in 1877. The mosque continued to be neglected in this manner until 1880, when architect Julius Franz Pasha, the head of the government's Comité de Conservation des Monuments de l'Art Arabe ('Committee for the Conservation of the Monuments of Arab Art'), closed the building and evicted its inhabitants. After this, it was examined by the Comité and assessed for repairs. Damage to the ceiling, arches, and minbar were all reported, among other problems. Recommendations were made to remove the walls blocking the arches and demolish the ad hoc structures that had been constructed inside the mosque by its poor inhabitants.\n\nAfter another examination in 1890, the Comité began restoration work. Various works were undertaken over the following years, though not enough to resolve all problems. The ceiling over the prayer hall continued to progressively fall apart, along with its arches facing the courtyard. A major event was the visit of King Fuad I, who attended Friday prayers in the mosque on 3 May 1918, the first ruler of Egypt to do so since Sultan Lajin. He subsequently took an interest in the mosque's maintenance and ordered the expropriation and removal of structures encroaching on it. In the following decade, efforts continued to remove encroaching structures and clear rubble. The Comité finally reconstructed the mosque's ceiling in 1927 and in the following two years it reconstructed the damaged arches of the prayer hall. Repair works continued intermittently after this, including the reconstruction of the westernmost walls of the ziyada (outer enclosure) from 1947 to 1948.\n\nThe Comité was dissolved in 1961 and the mosque, like other Islamic-era monuments in Cairo, was neglected for a time after this. Restoration efforts were resumed in 1978 by the government's Egyptian Antiquities Organization. While the mosque did not suffer greatly from the 1992 Cairo earthquake, the top of the minaret was damaged and its integrity compromised, which elicited the installation of scaffolding to support it.\n\nThe mosque underwent a full restoration from 2002 to 2004, which cost 2.5 million US dollars. One of the significant changes to the mosque's appearance was the paving of the entire courtyard with stone, as it had previously been largely unpaved. This had the negative side effect of causing humidity to accumulate along the walls, which were then injected with a consolidant. This action and other aspects of the restoration project were questioned and criticized by some scholars of Islamic architecture, including Caroline Williams.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Ibn Tulun Mosque is the oldest mosque in Egypt to largely retain its original form. Its architectural style is closely modeled on that of the Abbasid capital of the time, Samarra, where Ibn Tulun had spent much of his early career before being sent to Egypt. As a result, the mosque is one of the best surviving examples of the Abbasid architectural style of this period, which was dominated by the influence of Samarra. The mosque is one of the largest in Egypt by area: including its outer enclosure (ziyada), it occupies 26,318 square metres (283,280 sq ft). It is built primarily out of brick, except for the minaret, which is built of stone.\n\nExterior\nAn outer enclosure, the ziyada, surrounds the mosque on three sides and provided a buffer between the prayer space and the surrounding urban environment. The mosque's minaret stands in this enclosure on the northwest side. Originally, the mosque's ziyada contained ablutions facilities, latrines, and a medical clinic. The outer walls of the ziyada were likely adjoined by shops and neighbourhood markets. In the early 20th century, any market structures that were still adjoining the outer walls were removed.\n\nThe mosque had a total of twenty-two entrances: nineteen entrances through the ziyada (with doorways in the outer wall corresponding to doorways into the mosque proper) and another three doorways in the qibla (southeastern) wall. Only one entrance is used by visitors today. Unlike in later Egyptian mosques, none of the entrances are given architectural prominence, as this was not a feature of mosque architecture in Egypt until the later Fatimid period. The outer wall of the ziyada and the outer wall of the mosque are both topped by decorative crenellations consisting of brick openwork whose form, vaguely reminiscent of linked human figures, is likely derived from the decorative motifs inside the mosque.\n\nInterior\nOn the inside, the mosque consists of a spacious central courtyard (sahn) surrounded on four sides by roofed halls or galleries (riwaqs) divided into aisles by rows of pointed arches supported on piers. On the qibla side, this roofed area forms the main prayer hall and is five aisles deep, while the other three wings around the courtyard are two aisles deep. The arches and piers are built of brick and uphold a wooden roof built with palm. The corners of the piers are rounded by engaged columns. The upper parts of the piers, between the arches, are pierced with pointed windows that have their own colonettes.\nA dikka (raised platform for muezzins and Qur'an reciters) is located between two piers in the center of the prayer hall. It most likely dates to the Mamluk period. Next to the main mihrab (the concave niche in the qibla wall) is a wooden minbar, a pulpit for the imam, consisting of a wooden staircase leading to small kiosk-like structure topped by a curving finial. The inscription on the minbar attributes it to Sultan Lajin and dates it to 1296. It is an excellent example of early Mamluk-period woodwork.\n\nDecoration and inscriptions\nThe outlines of the arches, their intrados (undersides), and the capitals of the engaged columns are covered with carved stucco decoration, although only the arches of the southwestern side still preserve most of their intrados decoration. This decoration features geometric and floral patterns. They are derived from the Abbasid style associated with Samarra in this period, particularly those known to scholars as the \"Samarra B\" and \"Samarra C\" styles. Originally, this stucco decoration would have been painted in vivid colours, but the paint has since faded away. On the courtyard façades, the windows between the arches are also flanked by decorative rosettes. \nThe 128 windows of the mosque are also outlined with similar stucco decoration and are covered by stucco grilles. The window grilles seen today have a variety of geometric designs and date from different periods and restorations. Three or four of them are still original, from Ibn Tulun's time, and feature the simplest designs. The rest, with more complex designs, are from later restorations, including at least six from the Mamluk restoration of 1296.\n\nA long inscription on a wooden frieze runs just below the ceiling around the walls of the entire mosque, although much of it has disappeared over time and the frieze is now fragmented throughout the mosque. The inscription is carved in Kufic letters and is nearly 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) long in total. It replicates verses from the Qur'an, totaling to around one fifteenth of the entire book. The inscription is unusual for its time and it makes the Ibn Tulun Mosque the oldest surviving Islamic monument to contain religious inscriptions of such length.\n\nMihrabs (prayer niches)\nThe mosque contains six mihrabs (niches symbolizing the qibla or direction of prayer) at the mosque, five of which are flat as opposed to the main niche, which is concave. The main niche is situated in the centre of the qibla wall and is the tallest of the six. It dates from the Tulunid period but was redecorated under Sultan Lajin. The carved stucco decoration around the niche still dates from the Tulunid period, as do the pairs of marble columns with Coptic-style capitals on either side of the niche. Above the niche is a wooden frieze carved with a Kufic inscription of the Shahada (Muslim declaration of faith) followed by a blessing. Above this is a panel of wood with traces of faded painted decoration. The decoration inside the niche dates from Sultan Lajin's restoration. The upper zone is made of painted wood whose decoration has deteriorated, while the lower zone is covered in marble paneling that is characteristic of Mamluk decoration. In between these two zones is a wide band of glass mosaic containing an inscription of the Shahada in Naskhi script.\nThe other mihrabs in the prayer hall, all flat instead of concave, are the following:\n\nThe same qibla wall also features a smaller stucco mihrab to the left of the main niche. Its muqarnas sculpting and Naskhi calligraphy indicate an early Mamluk origin.\nThe two mihrabs on the piers flanking the dikka are decorated in the Samarran style, with one containing a unique medallion with a star hanging from a chain. The Kufic Shahada inscriptions on both do not mention Ali and were thus made before the Shi'a Fatimids came to power.\nThe westernmost mihrab, installed by al-Afdal Shahanshah, is a replica of an original kept at Cairo's Museum of Islamic Art. It is ornately decorated in a style with influences from Persia. The Kufic inscription mentions the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir, on whose orders the niche was made, as well as the Shi'a Shahada including Ali as God's wali after declaring the oneness of God and the prophethood of Muhammad.\nOn the pier to the left are the remains of a copy of al-Afdal's mihrab. It differs, however, by referring to Sultan Lajin instead of al-Mustansir, and a lack of Ali's name.\n\nFountain\nIn the center of the courtyard is a fountain (fisqiya) used for ablutions. It is sheltered by a square kiosk that is open through arches on all four sides, built in stone, and covered by a dome, built in brick. This dates to the restoration of Sultan Lajin in 1296, confirmed by a wooden inscription (now partially faded) in an upper corner on the outer wall of the kiosk. \nThe original Tulunid fountain of the mosque, referred to as a fawwāra, was covered by a dome resting on ten columns and surrounded by another sixteen columns. The columns were made of gilded marble. This structure burned down, most likely in the late 10th century, before it was replaced by another.\nThe present-day fountain consists of an octagonal stone basin on the floor. It was formerly surrounded by a marble floor which has since been replaced by modern pavement. The squinches inside the dome are executed in muqarnas (\"stalactite\"-style sculpting). Above the muqarnas is an inscription band carved in stucco containing part of Surah 4:43 from the Qur'an. At the apex of the dome is a circular medallion of carved stucco containing another inscription, of Surah 5:6. The outer walls of the kiosk were crowned by stepped crenellations that have disappeared.\nInside the northeastern wall, which is thicker than the others, is a small staircase that once led to a small room built on top of the wall, at the same level as the drum of the dome. This room, of unclear purpose and origin, could still be seen in 19th-century photos but was removed in the early 20th century. A sundial that once existed in the kiosk, mentioned in Sultan Lajin's inscription and recorded in the Description de l'Égypte, may have been associated with this room. This feature suggests that the room was intended for use by the timekeeper of the mosque.\n\nMinaret\nThe minaret is unusual in form. It consists of a rectangular (cuboid) shaft at the base, followed by a cylindrical section. An external staircase wraps around both sections in a spiral fashion. The shaft is crowned by a lantern-like summit, sometimes described as a mabkhara, with a ribbed dome. The tower is connected to the wall of the mosque by a bridge with horseshoe arches.\nThere is scholarly controversy over the construction date of the minaret. Historical records attest that the original minaret built under Ibn Tulun had an external staircase, which recalls the design of the helicoidal or spiral minarets in Abbasid Samarra (such as the Malwiya). The minarets of Samarra were thus probably the inspiration for its design. At least one historical source, Ibn Duqmaq, claimed that the staircase was wide enough to accommodate two camels. Legend has it that Ibn Tulun himself was accidentally responsible for the design of the structure: supposedly while sitting with his officials, he absentmindedly wound a piece of parchment around his finger. When someone asked him what he was doing, he responded, embarrassed, that he was designing his minaret. Architectural historian Tarek Swelim argues that the original minaret was probably aligned with the central axis of the building, like other Abbasid minarets from the 9th century, instead of the current tower's location.\n\nMany of the architectural features in the current structure, however, point to a later construction. The design of the minaret's top level, in the characteristic mabkhara-style, is of early Mamluk style, while the horseshoe arches and corbels look to be of 13th-century Andalusi inspiration. The fact that it is built of stone instead of brick is inconsistent with the rest of the mosque. Moreover, the minaret does not connect well with the main mosque structure, something that would have been averted had the minaret and mosque been built at the same time.\nArchitectural historians have drawn varying conclusions. K. A. C. Creswell argued that the entire structure of the present minaret is a reconstruction by Mamluk sultan Lajin from the 1296 restoration and that it was inspired by the original Tulunid spiral minaret. Jonathan Bloom suggests that the original minaret may have disappeared by the second half of the 12th century and that it was rebuilt in the late 12th or early 13th century. Doris Behrens-Abouseif argues that the structure instead shows evidence of multiple construction phases and that the original Tulunid minaret mostly survived but was then restored by Sultan Lajin, who added some of the present-day elements. She notes that the main shaft does not resemble any Mamluk-era minarets and that this would be unlikely if Lajin had rebuilt it completely. She also points out that one 10th-century source, al-Muqaddasi, states that the Tulunid minaret was indeed built of stone and notes that no sources mention its demolition or disappearance. Tarek Swelim suggests that the original minaret was damaged and at some point was replaced by a minaret with the present-day rectangular base, built next to the original. He suggests that the circular portion of the shaft was perhaps added during the Ayyubid period (late 12th to early 13th centuries) and then the top level was added by Lajin.\nHistorical sources and early 19th-century illustrations indicate that the minaret was previously topped by an unusual copper finial in the shape of a boat. This finial was possibly replaced by a similar one at some point before the 1840s but it must have disappeared sometime between 1800, when it was last noted, and 1892, when it was replaced by a crescent-shaped finial.\n\nAdjacent structures\nAt the southwestern corner of the mosque, standing within the ziyada, is a sabil-maktab or sabil-kuttab (structure combining a sabil and maktab). This structure has been attributed to either Sultan Lajin in 1296 or to Sultan Qaytbay between 1462 and 1482. Tarek Swelim suggests that it was most likely built first by Lajin and then restored by Qaytbay. \nAt the southeastern corner of the mosque, located outside the ziyada and on the site of the former Dar al-Imara, is a pair of historic mansions, connected by a bridge, which became known as Bayt al-Kritliya. They were built in the 16th and 17th centuries. The complex now serves as the Gayer-Anderson Museum. Another structure outside the ziyada, adjoining its outer wall on the northwest side, is the Madrasa of Amir Sarghatmish, built around 1350.\n\nIn popular culture\nParts of the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me were filmed at the mosque. The mosque is featured in the game Serious Sam 3: BFE, forming a significant part of the game's third level. It is also featured in a level of Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation.\n\nThe front of the Egyptian five-pound banknote has been adorned with an illustration of the Ibn Tulun Mosque in multiple editions. Meanwhile, the back of the current banknote features an image of a Pharaonic painting.\n\nSee also\nIslam in Egypt\nList of mosques in Cairo\nList of mosques in Egypt\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\nBehrens-Abouseif, Doris (1989).

القطائع ليصبح ثالث مسجد جامع بني في عاصمه مصر الاسلاميه بعد جامع عمرو بن العاص الذي بني في الفسطاط، وجامع العسكر الذي بني في مدينه العسكر ورغم ان مسجد عمرو بن العاص لا يزال موجودًا الا ان المسجد الطولوني يعد اقدم مساجد مصر القائمه حتى الان لاحتفاظه بحالته الاصليه بالمقارنه مع مسجد عمرو بن العاص الذي توالت عليه الاصلاحات التي غيرت معالمه.\nشُيد المسجد فوق ربوه صخريه كانت تعرف بجبل يشكر، ويُعتبر من المساجد المعلقه، وهو احد اكبر مساجد مصر حيث تبلغ مساحته مع الزيادات الخارجيه حوالي سته افدنه ونصف الفدان، وقد بُني على شكل مربع مستلهمًا من طرز المساجد العباسيه وخاصه مسجد سامراء بالعراق الذي استلهم منه المناره الملويه. يقع المسجد حاليًا بميدان احمد بن طولون بحي السيده زينب التابع للمنطقه الجنوبيه بالقاهره، ويجاور سوره الغربي مسجد صرغتمش الناصري فيما يجاور سوره الشرقي متحف جاير اندرسون.\n\nالمنشئ\nمنشئ المسجد هو احمد بن طولون مؤسس الدوله الطولونيه في مصر والشام، تعود اصوله الى قبيله التغزغز التركيه، وكانت اُسرته تقيم في بخاري. كان والده «طولون» مملوكًا لنوح بن اسد الساماني عامل بخارى وخراسان، فارسله هديه الى الخليفه المامون مع من اُرسل من المماليك الترك سنه 200هـ/816م. واسم طولون مشتق من كلمه تركيه (بالتركيه: Tolun) معناها البدر الكامل. انجب طولون عددًا من الابناء من بينهم احمد الذي يكنى بابي العباس سنه 220هـ/835م وولد في بغداد بالعراق من جاريه تدعى قاسم، فنشا مختلفًا عن اقرانه من اولاد العجم، حريصًا على الابتعاد عن جو العبث واللهو والمنكرات، واشتهر بالتقوى والصلاح والشده والقوه والباس. ارسله الوزير عبيد الله بن يحيى بن خاقان الى ثغر طرسوس فقضى فيه عده سنوات اخذ خلالها العلم والحديث والاداب عن كبار العلماء. بدا بزوغ نجم احمد بن طولون عندما كان في العشرين من عمره بعد وفاه والده سنه 240هـ/854م، حيث فوض اليه الخليفه العباسي المتوكل ما كان لابيه من الاعمال العسكريه.\n\nبعد مقتل الخليفه المستعين وتوليه المعتز، وُلي بايكباك التركي على مصر ولكن لرغبته في البقاء قريبًا من عاصمه الخلافه اناب احمد بن طولون عنه في امور الحكم لما عرف عنه من رجاحه العقل وحسن السيره ولقرابته منه، فدخل ابن طولون مصر سنه 254هـ/868م. ورغم وشاه مراكز القوى في مصر التي كانت توزع عليها سلطه الحكم باحمد بن طولون عند الخليفه، الا انه ظل في سده الحكم باستخدام سياسه بذل المال لاولي الامر في بغداد، كما كان يدعمه حلفاؤه من القاده الترك المُهيمنين على مقدرات الخلافه مثل بايكباك ويارجوخ. بدا احمد بن طولون في تدعيم اواصل حكمه في مصر، فتخلص من بعض اعدائه واضعف البعض الاخر وكان على راسهم ابن المدبر وشقير الحاجب، وساعدته الظروف السياسيه في بغداد على الوصول الى مراده حيث قتل بايكباك سنه 256هـ/870م وخلفه يارجوخ واليًا على مصر، الذي اناب بدوره ابن طولون على الحكم، ولما توفي يارجوخ سنه 259هـ/873م، ولى الخليفه المعتمد ابن طولون حكم مصر، وفي سنه 263هـ/877م قلده المعتمد امر خراج مصر وامره الثغور الشَاميه، فاضحى السيد الاوحد للديار المصريه والمشرف على جميع امورها، وقام بِضرب الدينار الاحمدي رمزًا لهذا الاستقلال، وامتدت حدود دولته من ليبيا الى حدود الدوله البيزنطيه في اسيا الصغرى، ومن نهر الفرات الى شلال النيل الاول. كان ابن طولون رجل دوله من الطراز الاول ذو كفاءه اداريه وعسكريه، فعني بشئون دولته ووضع اسس تحويلها الى دوله قويه، وشملت اصلاحاته سائر شئون الدوله المختلفه، فبنى مدينه القطائع وشيد القصور والمستشفيات والملاجئ وقناطر المياه، وشجع الزراعه واصلح السدود والترع والقنوات، وحفر الجديد منها، وحمى الفلاحين من ظلم جباه الضرائب واصلح مقياس النيل بالروضه. كما ازدهرت في عهده الصناعه، فاشتهرت مصر بصناعه النسيج. وانشا كذلك مسجده المعروف الذي لا يزال شاهدًا على ازدهار عصر بانيه. ادى نجاحه في اداره شئون البلاد الى انتشار الرخاء والعمار والعدل بين الرعيه. وتوفي احمد بن طولون سنه 270هـ/884م وخلفه على الحكم ابنه خمارويه ودفن بمدافن الطولونيين بالقرافه الصغرى بالقرب من بابها بسفح المقطم.\n\nالمهندس\nاختلف المؤرخون حول شخصيه مهندس المسجد، فرجح بعضهم انه كان نصرانيًا يدعى سعيد بن كاتب الفرغاني، وانه كان مهندس عينًا للماء طلب بنائها ابن طولون فلما اتمها دعا ابن طولون لزيارتها ولسوء حظه كان بموضع البناء جيرًا لا زال رطبًا غاصت به قدم فرس ابن طولون فكبا به فظن انه اراد به سوءًا، فامر بجلده وسجنه، وظل بمحبسه حتى اراد ابن طولون بناء الجامع فقُدر له ثلاثمائه عمود صعب تدبيرها الا عبر استخدام اعمده الكنائس والاديره المتخربه، فتورع ابن طولون عن ذلك، ولما بلغ النصراني في محبسه الخبر كتب لابن طولون انه يبنيه له كما يحب ويختار بلا اعمده الا عمودي القبله، فاخرجه ابن طولون واحضر له جلودًا للرسم، فصور له النصراني المسجد فاُعجب به واستحسنه، واطلق سراحه وخلع عليه ورصد له مائه الف دينار لنفقه البناء وكل ما يحتاج بعد ذلك، فوضع النصراني يده في البناء في موضع جبل يشكر، فلما اتم البناء وراح ابن طولون لزياره المسجد، صعد النصراني الى المناره صائحًا بابن طولون بطلب الجائزه والامان خوفًا من ان يجري له ما جرى في المره الاولى، فامنه ابن طولون وكافاه بعشره الاف دينار وخلع عليه واجرى له رزقاً واسعاً. اما المجموعه الاخرى من المؤرخين فيرجحون ان المهندس لم يكن نصرانياً بل كان عراقيًا بسبب تاثر مصمم المسجد بتصميم مسجد سامراء بالعراق، وعدم استخدام الاساطين او الاعمده الرخاميه في البناء بل استُخدم بدلًا من ذلك العقود القائمه على دعائم من الاجر. ورجح بعضهم ان المهندس هو احمد بن محمد الحاسب الذي قدم من العراق لبناء مقياس النيل الجديد بالروضه.\n\nالتاريخ\nلما اسس احمد بن طولون مدينته القطائع سنه 256هـ/870م كي تكون مدينه خاصه به وبحاشيته وجنده، بعد ان ضاقت عليهم الفسطاط والعسكر، وكرمز لاستقلاله عن الدوله العباسيه، وكما كان معهودًا في ذلك الوقت بان المسجد الجامع هو مركز العواصم الاسلاميه، فقد شيد بن طولون مسجده الضخم بالقطائع، وذُكر ان من اسباب بناء الجامع هو ضيق جامع مدينه العسكر بالمصلين، فبدئ في بناء المسجد سنه 263هـ/877م وانتهى البناء في سنه 265هـ/879م، ورصد لبناء المسجد مائه الف دينار ولكن بلغت تكلفته عند الانتهاء منه مائه وعشرون الف دينار كان مصدرها كنز عثر عليه بن طولون في الجبل.\nلما اُتمت عماره المسجد نُقل اليه القراء والفقهاء وصلى فيه القاضي بكار بن قتيبه، ودرس فيه الربيع بن سليمان حديث «من بنى لله مسجدً ولو كمفحص قطاه بنى الله له بيتًا في الجنه»، وتصدق بن طولون بصدقات عظيمه واطعم الفقراء والمساكين، وقد تقرب الناس بالصلاه فيه والزم اولادهم صلاه الجمعه في فواره الجامع ثم يخرجون بعد الصلاه الى مجلس الربيع بن سليمان ليكتبوا العلم ومع كل واحد وراق وعده غلمان. وعرف الجامع في القرن الرابع الهجري/العاشر الميلادي بـ«الجامع الفوقاني»، تمييزًا له عن «الجامع السفلاني» وهو جامع عمرو بن العاص في الفسطاط.\nلما فشلت مؤامره قتل السلطان الاشرف خليل بن قلاوون، التي شارك الامير حسام الدين لاجين في تدبيرها، هرب لاجين ولوحق فتخفى بالمسجد، ونذر الى الله ان نجا من هذه المحنه ان يعمرن المسجد، فتحقق مراده وجلس على عرش مصر، فابر بنذره واكمل اصلاح المسجد من كل وجه سنه 696هـ/1296م، ورتب فيه دروسًا للفقه على المذاهب الاربعه، ودرسًا في تفسير القران الكريم، ودرسًا في الحديث النبوي، ودرسًا في الطب، ورتب للمسجد خطيبًا ومؤذنين وفراشين وقرر لهم رواتب، وعمل بجواره مكتبًا لاقراء ايتام المسلمين القران الكريم، ومنذ اجراء تلك التجديدات اصبح يلي نظاره المسجد قاضي القضاه، وكان اول من ولي نظارته قاضي القضاه بدر الدين بن جماعه. وفي سنه 767هـ جدد الامير يلبغا الخاصكي العمري درسًا بالمسجد فيه سبعه مدرسين للحنفيه، وقرر لكل فقيه من الطلبه في الشهر اربعين درهماً واردب قمح.\n\nقصص حول المسجد\nلما امعن احمد بن طولون في الصحراء غاصت قدم فرس احمد غلمانه في الرمال فسقط الغلام فوقف بن طولون ونظر فوجد فتق مكان قدم الفرس ففتح فاصاب فيه من المال ما بلغ مقداره الف الف دينار وهو ما سمي «المطلب» الذي شاع خبره، وكتب به الى الخليفه المعتمد في بغداد يستاذنه فيما يصرفه فيه من وجوه البر، فبنى منه «البيمارستان»، ثم اًصاب بعده في الجبل مالًا عظيمًا «الكنز» فبنى منه الجامع، واوقف جميع ما بقي من المال في الصدقات.\nلما مر احمد بن طولون على المسجد اثناء بنائه في رمضان، فراي العمال يشتغلون الى وقت الغروب، فسال متى يشتري هؤلاء الضعفاء افطار لاولادهم، وامر بصرفهم وقت العصر، فاتخذ هذا سنه من وقتها.\nلما اتم بناء المسجد راى احمد بن طولون في منامه كان الله تعالى قد تجلى للقصور التي حول المسجد ولم يتجلى للمسجد، فسال المعبرين، فقالوا: يخرب ما حوله ويبقى قائمًا وحده، فقال: من اين لكم هذا، قالوا: من قوله تعالى: ﴿فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّى رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُ دَكًَّا﴾ [الاعراف:143]، وقوله صلى الله عليه وسلم: اذا تجلى الله لشئ خضع له.\nلما فرغ احمد بن طولون من بناء المسجد امر حاشيته بسماع ما يقول الناس فيه من الاقوال والعيوب، فقال رجل: محرابه صغير، وقال اخر: ما فيه عمود، وقال اخر: ليست له ميضاه، فبلغه ذلك فجمع الناس وقال: اما المحراب فاني رايت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وقد خطه لي في منامي، واصبحت فرايت النمل قد طافت بذلك المكان الذي خطه لي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، واما العمد فاني بنيت هذا الجامع من مال حلال وهو الكنز، وما كنت لاشوبه بغيره، وهذه العمد اما ان تكون في مسجد او كنيسه فنزهته عنها، واما الميضاه فاني نظرت فوجدت ما يكون بها من النجاسات فطهرته عنها، وها انا ابنيها خلفه وامر ببنائها.\nلما فرغ احمد بن طولون من بناء الجامع راى في منامه كان ناراً نزلت من السماء فاخذت الجامع دون ما حوله من العمران، فلما اصبح قص رؤياه فقيل له: ابشر بقبول الجامع المبارك لان النار كانت في الزمن الماضي، اذا قبل الله قرباناً نزلت نار من السماء اخذته.\nلما رقي الخطيب ابو يعقوب البلخي المنبر وخطب، دعا للمعتمد ولولده ونسي ان يدعو لابن طولون ونزل عن المنبر، فاشار الامير الى غلامه نسيم بضرب الخطيب خمسمائه سوط، فتذكر الخطيب سهوه وهو على مراقي المنبر فعاد وقال: الحمد لله وصلى الله على سيدنا محمد ولقد عهدنا الى بني ادم من قبل فنسى ولم نجد له عزما، اللهم واصلح الامير ابا العباس احمد بن طولون مولى امير المؤمنين، وزاد في الشكر والدعاء له بقدر الخطبه ثم نزل، فنظر الامير الى الغلام باستبدال الاسواط بالدنانير، ووقف الخطيب على ما كان منه فحمد الله تعالى على سلامته وهناه الناس.\nلما انتهى الجامع وفتح للصلاه لم يحضر احد من المصلين لاعتقادهم انه بني بمال لا يعرفون اصله وكان الناس في ذلك الوقت محترزين على دينهم، فعز ذلك على ابن طولون وجمعهم في يوم جمعه وخطب فيهم واقسم بالله العظيم الذي لا اله الا هو انه ما بنى هذا الجامع «ويده تشير اليه» بشيء من ماله وانه بناه بكنز ظفر به في الجبل الثالث، وان العشارى الذي نصبه على مئذنته وجده في الكنز، واكمل الخطبه، فلما سمع الناس ذلك اجتمع خلق كثير وصلوا فيه الجمعه ولما سمع الناس حكايه المحراب الذي خطه النمل عظم ذلك عندهم حتى ضاق بالمصلين فقالوا لابن طولون نريد ان تزيد لنا فيه زياده، فزاد فيه ما يعرف حالياً بالزيادات.\n\nالتصميم\nيعتبر المسجد من المساجد المعلقه اذ يصعد الى ابوابه الداخليه بدرجات دائريه، وهو من اكبر مساجد مصر حيث تبلغ مساحته مع الزيادات سته افدنه ونصف الفدان، استخدم في بنائه الطوب الاحمر، واقيم على جبل يشكر، فكان اساسه في حدوده القبليه على صخر الجبل مباشره، اما في حدوده البحريه فكانت اساساته على عمق خمسه امتار. وضع تصميمه على مثال المساجد الجامعه التي لها صحن كبير مكشوف تحيط به اروقه ذات عقود. وبني المسجد على شكل مربع تقريباً طول ضلعه 162.25 متر × 161.50 متر، يشغل منها المسجد مع جدرانه مستطيلاً طول ضلعه 137.80 متر × 118.10 متر، ويتوسطه صحن مكشوف مربع تقريباً طول ضلعه 92.35 متر × 91.80 متر، ويحيط بالجامع من جوانبه القبليه والبحريه والغربيه اروقه غير مسقوفه تعرف بالزيادات وهي من المسجد، واسوار هذه الزيادات عاليه بسيطه، فتحت بها ابواب تقابل ابواب الجامع، تتوجها من اعلى شرفه مفرغه، كما فتحت باسوار الجامع ابواب وشبابيك علويه، بينها حنايا وطاقات مخوصه تتوجها من اعلى شرفات. وللمسجد 21 باب يقابلها نفس العدد في الزيادات، ويوجد في بعض الابواب معابر خشبيه قديمه بها زخارف مورقه، وسبب تعدد الابواب كان لتسهيل الوصول الى المساكن والاسواق التي كانت حول الجامع.\nبعد تجاوز سور الزياده وابواب المسجد يُوصل الى الايوانات التي يتوسطها صحن كبير، يمثل الايوان الشرقي ايوان القبله وهو اكبر الايوانات واكثرها اروقه وزخرفه، حيث يشتمل على خمسه اروقه، فيما تشتمل باقي الايوانات على رواقين، وبه اللوحه التاسيسيه للمسجد التي تتضمن تاريخ انشاؤه، ويتوسط جداره الشرقي المحراب الرئيسي، وهيكله طولوني، اما الفسيفساء والطاقيه الخشب ومقرنص القبه اعلاه فهي من اعمال السلطان لاجين، الذي تنضم الى اعماله ايضاً المنبر الخشبي الذي اتُخذت حشواته من خشب الساج الهندي والابنوس المدقوق بنقوش مورقه في منتهى الدقه، ونقل لاجين المنبر القديم الى الجامع الظاهري الذي تلاشى حالياً ولم يبق له اثر. وبالاضافه الى المحراب الرئيسي بهذا الايوان توجد خمس محاريب جصيه غير مجوفه اخرى استجدت بعد ذلك، اثنان صغيران احدهما على يمين دكه المبلغ والاخر على يسارها، والمحراب المستنصري الموجود في منتصف البائكه الثانيه بالرواق الشرقي من جهه الصحن، وعلى يساره محراب السلطان لاجين، ومحراب يعود الى عصر المماليك البحريه على يسار المحراب الرئيسي. والاروقه مكونه من دعائم مبنيه بالطوب مخلق في نواصيها الاربع عمد وتيجان تحمل عقوداً ستينيه حليت حافاتها بزخارف جصيه نباتيه وفتح فيها شبابيك حليت بزخارف متنوعه، ويعلو العقود افريز زخرفي من الجص يعلوه ازار خشبي يحيط باروقه المسجد مكتوب فيه بالخط الكوفي البارز سورتا البقره وال عمران. وكان لاختيار الدعائم بدلاً من العمد دليلاً على حسن ذوق المصمم لتماثلها في الطول والسمك وهو ما لا ينطبق على العمد الرخاميه التي كانت تختلس عاده من من الكنائس والاديره المتخربه. استعمل الاسمنت المسلح بالسقوف الاثريه لاول مره في هذا المسجد، وكان ذلك على يد محمود باشا احمد مدير اداره حفظ الاثار العربيه فبنى السقف بتقاسيمه القديمه من الاسمنت المسلح ثم غلفه بالاخشاب القديمه والجديده المطابقه للقديم. ويحيط بجدران المسجد الاربعه من اعلى مائه وتسعه وعشرون شباكاً من الجص المفرغ باشكال هندسيه ونباتيه.\nوالقبه وسط الصحن هي ثالث قبه اقيمت للمسجد، حيث احترقت القبه الاولى الطولونيه للصحن سنه 376هـ/986م، وتهدمت الثانيه التي انشئها العزيز بالله وقيل امه تغريد سنه 385هـ/995م، وحلت محلها القبه الموجوده حالياً وهي من ضمن اعمال السلطان لاجين بالمسجد وانشئها سنه 696هـ/1296م، وهي قبه كبيره يقاس كل من ضلعيها القبلي والبحري 12.75 متر وضلعيها الشرقي والغربي 14.10 متر، وهي محموله على اربعه عقود كانت شبابيكها محلاه بزخارف وكتابات كوفيه، وبرقبتها من الداخل كتبت ايه الوضوء، ويتوسطها فسقيه، وفي جدارها سلم يوصل الى سطح قاعدتها المربعه. اقيمت المناره على مسافه 0.40 سم من حائط الزياده الغربيه وهي مبنيه بالحجر مقاس قاعدتها 12.78 متر × 13.65 متر، وهي مكونه من اربع طبقات الاولى مربعه والثانيه مستديره وهي التي بها السلم الحلزوني والثالثه مثمنه اما الرابعه فتعلوها طاقيه تكون معها شكل مبخره. وهي المناره الوحيده في مصر التي لها سلم خارجي يشبه مناره مسجد سامراء. وتاريخ انشاء المناره محل خلاف بين الاثريين حيث يرى بعضهم ان السلطان لاجين جددها كامله سنه 696هـ/1296م على مثالها القديم ضمن اعماله بالمسجد، ويرى البعض الاخر انها طولونيه عدا قمتها التي جددها السلطان لاجين.\nاما القبه فوق المحراب فهي مكونه من قاعده مربعه من الخارج تحتوي على مجموعه من المقرنصات مكسوه بالخشب لتحويل المربع الى شكل مثمن ثم الى الدائره التي ترتكز عليها القبه، وتلك القبه من اعمال السلطان لاجين بالمسجد. الحق بالمسجد سبيل يقع بالناحيه الشرقيه من الزياده الجنوبيه له واجهه رئيسه هي الغربيه يبلغ طولها 19.80 متر وتنقسم الى جزاين الاول يضم باب الدخول والثاني يضم شباك السبيل، وحجره التسبيل مستطيله المسقط طولها من الشرق الى الغرب 11.75 متر وعرضها 5.35 متر، ويغطي حجره السبيل سقف من براطيم خشبيه عليه اثار زخارف نباتيه ملونه وباركانه اربع مقرنصات يتكون كل منها من سبع حطات متتاليه. وبجوار المحراب الرئيسي باب في الجهه الجنوبيه الشرقيه كان يخرج ويدخل منه ابن طولون الى دار الاماره الملاصقه للمسجد ليغير ثيابه او يجدد وضوئه او لاخذ قسط من الراحه ثم يعود فيدخل الى الصف الاول دون ان يتخطى جموع المصلين، ودمرت هذه الدار مع الدمار الذي حل بمدينه القطائع بعد زوال الدوله الطولونيه، والدار القائمه اليوم مكانها هي من اعمال السلطان لاجين.\n\nنص التاسيس\nنص التاسيس على واجهه مدخل الباب\n\nالترميم\nتوالت يد الاصلاح والترميم على المسجد في اكثر من مناسبه كان منها في عهد الخليفه الحاكم بامر الله الذي انزل الى المسجد ثمانمائه واربعه عشر مصحفاُ. وكان في وسط صحن المسجد فسقيه من الرخام تعلوها قبه مثمنه الشكل مذهبه ومحموله على اعمده من رخام، تعرضت سنه 376هـ/986م في عهد الخليفه الفاطمي العزيز بالله لحريق، فاقام بدلاً منها قبه اخرى سنه 385هـ/995م، ولكن هذا التجديد لم يقو ايضاً على مواجهه عوامل الزمن. وخلال خلافه المستنصر بالله سنه 470هـ/1077م اجتاح مصر الوباء والقحط، فنشعت جدران المسجد والم به الخراب، فلحقه الوزير بدر الدين الجمالي سنه 470هـ/1077م واصلح اركانه وقوم بنيانه. وفي سنه 526هـ/1131م امر الخليفه الحافظ لدين الله ببعض اصلاحات بالمسجد. وفي عهد صلاح الدين الايوبي اختص المسجد بفريق من المغاربه استعمره اكثر من جيل، الى ان تولى حكم مصر السلطان الظاهر بيبرس فاتخذ ملحقات المسجد شونه للغلال سنه 662هـ/1263م. ثم كانت اصلاحات السلطان حسام الدين لاجين سنه 696هـ/1296م التي شملت بناؤه للسبيل الموجود بالنصف الشرقي من الزياده القبليه والذي جدده السلطان قايتباي فيما بعد، وانشاؤه القبه القائمه اليوم على فسقيه بوسط الصحن والتي لها سلم يؤدي الى ظهرها عمل في جدار قاعدتها البحري بدلاً من بناؤه منفصلاً، وتجديده كذلك الجزء العلوي المضلع من المئذنه الكبرى الذي يعلو دورتها المستديره، وتشييده للمنبر الحالي. وفي عهد الناصر محمد بن قلاوون انشا بالمسجد منارتين اسطوانيتين على طرفي جداره الشرقي بناهما بالطوب، هدمت الاولى في القرن الثالث عشر الهجري، والثانيه البحريه الشرقيه في سنه 1933 لخلل بهما. وفي عهد الظاهر برقوق انشا الحاج عبيد بن محمد البازدار سنه 792هـ/1390م رواقاً بجوار المئذنه الكبرى، وجدد ميضاه بجانب الميضاه القديمه، ثم تلاه الشيخ شرف الدين المدني فانشا مصلى وتربه سنه 930هـ/1534م، وقد زالت انشاءات البازدار والمدني في عماره سور الزياده الغربيه سنه 1943. وفي ايام محمد بك ابى الذهب انشا بالمسجد مصنعاً لعمل الاحرمه الصوفيه. وفي سنه 1263هـ/1847م حول كلوت بك المسجد الى ملجا للعجزه، وظل كذلك حتى سنه 1882 حين ادركت لجنه حفظ الاثار العربيه المسجد فوجهت اليه عنايتها وقامت خلال الفتره من 1890 وحتى 1918 بازاله الابنيه المستحدثه التي كانت بداخل الايوانات، وهدمت بعض الدور التي كانت تحجب الوجهه الشرقيه للمسجد، وازالت الاتربه والانقاض، واصلحت القبه التي فوق المحراب والمناره الكبيره والمناره البحريه الشرقيه والمنبر والشبابيك الجصيه وجزء من السقف، وحافظت على الزخارف الجصيه.\nوفي عهد الملك فؤاد الاول سنه 1918 رغب في اعاده اقامه الشعائر الدينيه بالمسجد فصلى فيه فريضه الجمعه وامر بتخليه جوانبه وتتميم اصلاحه، فقامت اللجنه بتخليه الوجهه البحريه وفتح ابوابها، واصلاح اسوارها وازالت الابنيه المحدثه بالزياده القبليه، واخلت قسم كبير من الوجهتين الشرقيه والغربيه، وبلطت اروقه الايوانات الغربيه والبحريه والقبليه، واصلحت الزخارف الجصيه بباطن العقود، والسبيل الموجود بالزياده القبليه، وازالت الاتربه من الزيادات ومهدتها ومعها والصحن، واعادت بناء الرواق المشرف على الصحن من الايوان الشرقي، كما عملت لجميع الاروقه سقف من الاسمنت المسلح برسم السقف القديم وغلفته باخشاب ادخلت فيها الاجزاء القديمه، واعادت تركيب الازار الكوفي فيها، وبلغت تكلفه تلك الاصلاحات 40 الف جنيه، كما بلغت تكلفه نزع الملكيه 45 الف جنيه. وفي عهد الملك فاروق الاول اُصلح كثير من الشبابيك الجصيه كما اصلح المحراب المستنصري ونزعت ملكيه بعض الدور التي تلاصق الزياده الغربيه بجوار المناره الكبيره وكذلك بقيه الدور التي تحجب الوجهتين الشرقيه والقبليه. اما اخر محاولات ترميم المسجد فكانت في عام 2005 حين قامت وزاره الثقافه المصريه بترميم زخارفه وافتتاحه كواحد من بين 38 مسجداً تم ترميمها ضمن مشروع القاهره التاريخي، وقد اعلنت وزاره الثقافه ان اعاده ترميم الجامع تجاوزت تكلفتها 12 مليون جنيه.\n\nسرقه المحتويات\nفي يونيو 2014 سُرقت مفصلات نحاسيه من باب المقدم «باب المنبر» عليها نقوش اسلاميه تعود للعصر المملوكي، وفي يوليو 2014 تمكنت الشرطه من ضبط المسروقات والقبض على اللصوص.\n\nالتكريم\nبما ان المسجد الطولوني من الاثار المصريه التي لها رونق خاص، وكنوع من تسليط الدوله المصريه الضوء على احد ابرز معالمها السياحيه والاثريه، فقد تم تزيين وجه العمله الورقيه المصريه فئه خمسه جنيهات برسم صوره مسجد ابن طولون في اكثر من اصدار، فيما يحمل ظهر الورقه الحاليه صوره للوحه فرعونيه.\n\nمعرض صور\nانظر ايضًا\nمصادر\nهوامش\nملاحظات\nمراجع\nوصلات خارجيه\nصور
