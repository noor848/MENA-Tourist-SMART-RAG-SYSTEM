      "content": "Al-Azhar Mosque (Arabic: الجامع الأزهر, romanized: al-Jāmiʿ al-ʾAzhar, lit. 'The Resplendent Congregational Mosque'), known in Egypt simply as al-Azhar, is a mosque in the historic Islamic core of the city of Cairo, Egypt. Commissioned as the new capital of the Fatimid Caliphate in 970 CE, it was the first mosque established in a city that eventually earned the nickname \"the City of a Thousand Minarets\". Its name is usually thought to derive from az-Zahrāʾ (lit. 'the shining one'), a title given to Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad.\nAfter its dedication in 972, and with the hiring by mosque authorities of 35 scholars in 989, the mosque slowly developed into what it is today.\nThe affiliated Al-Azhar University is the second oldest continuously run one in the world after Al-Qarawiyyin in Idrisid Fes. It has long been regarded as the foremost institution in the Islamic world for the study of Sunni theology and sharia, or Islamic law. In 1961, the university, integrated within the mosque as part of a mosque school since its inception, was nationalized and officially designated an independent university, Al-Azhar Al-Sharif, following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.\nOver the course of its over a millennium-long history, the mosque has been alternately neglected and highly regarded. Because it was founded as a Shiite Ismaili institution, Saladin and the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty that he founded shunned al-Azhar, removing its status as a congregational mosque and denying stipends to students and teachers at its school. These moves were reversed under the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule numerous expansions and renovations took place. Later rulers of Egypt showed differing degrees of deference to the mosque and provided widely varying levels of financial assistance, both to the school and to the upkeep of the mosque. Today, al-Azhar remains a deeply influential institution in Egyptian society that is highly revered in the Sunni Muslim world and a symbol of Islamic Egypt.\n\nName\nThe city of Cairo was established by the Fatimid general Jawhar al-Siqilli, on behalf of the Fatimid caliph al-Mu'izz, following the Fatimid conquest of Egypt in 969. It was originally named al-Manṣūriyya (المنصورية) after the prior seat of the Fatimid caliphate, al-Mansuriyya in modern Tunisia. The mosque, first used in 972, may have initially been named Jāmiʿ al-Manṣūriyya (جامع المنصورية, \"the mosque of Mansuriyya\"), as was common practice at the time. It was al-Mu'izz who renamed the city al-Qāhira (القاهرة, \"the Victorious\"). The name of the mosque thus became Jāmiʿ al-Qāhira (جامع القاهرة, \"the mosque of Cairo\"), the first transcribed in Arabic sources.\nThe mosque acquired its current name, al-ʾAzhar, sometime between the caliphate of al-Mu'izz and the end of the reign of the second Fatimid caliph in Egypt, al-Aziz Billah (r. 975–996). ʾAzhar is the masculine form for zahrāʾ, meaning \"splendid\" or \"most resplendent\". Zahrāʾ is an epithet applied to Muhammad's daughter Fatimah, wife of caliph Ali. She was claimed as the ancestress of al-Mu'izz and the imams of the Fatimid dynasty; one theory is that her epithet is the source for the name al-ʾAzhar. The theory, however, is not confirmed in any Arabic source and its plausibility has been both supported and denied by later Western sources.\nAn alternative theory is that the mosque's name is derived from the names given by the Fatimid caliphs to their palaces. Those near the mosque were collectively named al-Quṣūr al-Zāhira (القصور الزاهرة, \"the Brilliant Palaces\") by al-Aziz Billah, and the royal gardens were named after another derivative of the word zahra. The palaces had been completed and named prior to the mosque changing its name from Jāmiʿ al-Qāhira to al-ʾAzhar.\nThe word Jāmiʿ is derived from the Arabic root word jamaʿa (g-m-ʿ), meaning \"to gather\". The word is used for large congregational mosques. While in classical Arabic the name for al-Azhar remains Jāmiʿ al-ʾAzhar, the pronunciation of the word Jāmiʿ changes to Gāmaʿ in Egyptian Arabic.\n\nHistory\nFatimid Caliphate\nAfter the conquest of Egypt, Jawhar al-Siqilli oversaw the construction of the royal enclosure for the caliph's court and the Fatimid army, and had al-Azhar built as a base to spread Isma'ili Shi'a Islam. Located near the densely populated Sunni city of Fustat, Cairo became the center of the Isma'ili sect of Shi'a Islam, and seat of the Fatimid empire.\nJawhar ordered the construction of a congregational mosque for the new city and work commenced on April 4, 970. The mosque was built out of limestone from the Mokattam Formation. The mosque was completed in 972 and the first Friday prayers were held there on June 22, 972 during Ramadan.\nAl-Azhar soon became a center of learning in the Islamic world, and official pronouncements and court sessions were issued from and convened there. Under Fatimid rule, the previously secretive teachings of the Isma'ili madh'hab (school of law) were made available to the general public. Al-Nu'man ibn Muhammad was appointed qadi (judge) under al-Mu'izz and placed in charge of the teaching of the Isma'ili doctrine. Classes were taught at the palace of the caliph, as well as at al-Azhar, with separate sessions available to women. During Eid al-Fitr in 973, the mosque was rededicated by the caliph as the official congregational mosque in Cairo. Al-Mu'izz, and his son—when he in turn became caliph—would preach at least one Friday khutbah (sermon) during Ramadan at al-Azhar.\nYaqub ibn Killis, a polymath, jurist and the first official vizier of the Fatimids, made al-Azhar a key center for instruction in Islamic law in 988. The following year, 45 scholars were hired to give lessons, laying the foundation for what would become the leading university in the Muslim world.\nThe mosque was expanded during the rule of the caliph al-Aziz Billah. According to al-Mufaddal, he ordered the restoration of portions of the mosque and had the ceiling raised by one cubit. The next Fatimid caliph, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (r. 996–1021), would continue to renovate the mosque, providing a new wooden door in 1010. However, al-Hakim's reign saw the completion of the al-Hakim Mosque, and al-Azhar lost its status as Cairo's primary congregational mosque. In May 1009 the al-Hakim Mosque became the sole location for the caliph's sermons; prior to this, al-Hakim would rotate where the Friday sermon was held. Following al-Hakim's reign, al-Azhar was restored by Caliph al-Mustansir Billah (r. 1036–1094). Additions and renovations were carried during the reign of the remaining Fatimid caliphs. Caliph al-Hafiz undertook a major refurbishment in 1138, which established the keel-shaped arches and carved stucco decoration seen in the courtyard today, as well as the dome at the central entrance of the prayer hall.\nInitially lacking a library, al-Azhar was endowed by the Fatimid caliph in 1005 with thousands of manuscripts that formed the basis of its collection. Fatimid efforts to establish Isma'ili practice among the population were, however largely unsuccessful. Much of its manuscript collection was dispersed in the chaos that ensued with the fall of the Fatimid Caliphate, and Al-Azhar became a Sunni institution shortly thereafter.\n\nAyyubid dynasty\nSaladin, who overthrew the Fatimids in 1171, was hostile to the Shi’ite principles of learning propounded at al-Azhar during the Fatimid Caliphate, and under his Ayyubid dynasty the mosque suffered from neglect. Congregational prayers were banned by Sadr al-Din ibn Dirbass, appointed qadi by Saladin. The reason for this edict may have been Shāfi‘ī teachings that proscribe congregational prayers in a community to only one mosque, or mistrust of the former Shi'a institution by the new Sunni ruler. By this time, the much larger al-Hakim Mosque was completed; congregational prayers in Cairo were held there.\nIn addition to stripping al-Azhar of its status as congregational mosque, Saladin also ordered the removal from the mihrab of the mosque a silver band on which the names of the Fatimid caliphs had been inscribed. This and similar silver bands removed from other mosques totaled 5,000 dirhems. Saladin did not completely disregard the upkeep of the mosque and according to al-Mufaddal one of the mosque's minarets was raised during Saladin's rule.\nThe teaching center at the mosque also suffered. The once well stocked library at al-Azhar was neglected, and manuscripts of Fatimid teachings that were held at al-Azhar were destroyed. The Ayyubid dynasty promoted the teaching of Sunni theology in subsidized madrasas (schools) built throughout Cairo. Student funding was withdrawn, organized classes were no longer held at the mosque, and the professors that had prospered under the Fatimids were forced to find other means to earn their living.\nAl-Azhar nevertheless remained the seat of Arabic philology and a place of learning throughout this period. While official classes were discontinued, private lessons were still offered in the mosque. There are reports that a scholar, possibly al-Baghdadi, taught a number of subjects, such as law and medicine, at al-Azhar. Saladin reportedly paid him a salary of 30 dinars, which was increased to 100 dinars by Saladin's heirs. While the mosque was neglected by Saladin and his heirs, the policies of the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty would have a lasting impact on al-Azhar. Educational institutions were established by Sunni rulers as a way of combating what they regarded as the heretical teachings of Shi'a Islam. These colleges, ranging in size, focused on teaching Sunni doctrine, had an established and uniform curriculum that included courses outside of purely religious topics, such as rhetorics, math, and science. No such colleges had been established in Egypt by the time of Saladin's conquest. Saladin and the later rulers of the Ayyubid dynasty would build twenty-six colleges in Egypt, among them the Salihiyya Madrasa.\nAl-Azhar eventually adopted Saladin's educational reforms modeled on the college system he instituted, and its fortunes improved under the Mamluks, who restored student stipends and salaries for the shuyūkh (teaching staff).\n\nMamluk Sultanate\nCongregational prayers were reestablished at al-Azhar during the Mamluk Sultanate by Sultan Baibars in 1266. While Shāfi‘ī teachings, which Saladin and the Ayyubids followed, stipulated that only one mosque should be used as a congregational mosque in a community, the Hanafi madh'hab, to which the Mamluks adhered, placed no such restriction. Al-Azhar had by now lost its association with the Fatimids and Ismāʿīli doctrines, and with Cairo's rapid expansion, the need for mosque space allowed Baibars to disregard al-Azhar's history and restore the mosque to its former prominence. Under Baibars and the Mamluk Sultanate, al-Azhar saw the return of stipends for students and teachers, as well as the onset of work to repair the mosque, which had been neglected for nearly 100 years. According to al-Mufaddal, the emir 'Izz al-Din Aydamur al-Hilli built his house next to the mosque and while doing so repaired the mosque. Al-Maqrizi reports that the emir repaired the walls and roof as well as repaving and providing new floor mats. The first khutbah since the reign of the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim took place on 16 January 1266 with the sermon delivered on a new pulpit completed five days earlier.\nAn earthquake in 1302 caused damage to al-Azhar and a number of other mosques throughout Mamluk territory. The responsibility for reconstruction was split among the amirs (princes) of the Sultanate and the head of the army, Sayf al-Din Salar, who was tasked with repairing the damage. These repairs were the first done since the reign of Baibars. Seven years later, a dedicated school, the Madrasa al-Aqbughawiyya, was built along the northwest wall of the mosque. Portions of the wall of the mosque were removed to accommodate the new building. Construction of another school, the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya began in 1332–1333. This building, which was completed in 1339–1340, would also impact the structure of the mosque as it was built over the site of the mida'a, the fountain for ablution. Both of the madrasas were built as complementary buildings to al-Azhar, with separate entrances and prayer halls.\nThough the mosque had regained its standing in Cairo, repairs and additional work were carried out by those in positions lower than sultan. This changed under the rule of al-Zahir Barquq, the first sultan of the Burji dynasty. Both Sultan Barquq and then Sultan al-Mu'ayyad tried, in 1397 and 1424 respectively, to replace the minaret of al-Azhar with a new one in stone, but on both occasions the construction was found to be defective and had to be pulled down. The resumption of direct patronage by those in the highest positions of government continued through to the end of Mamluk rule. Improvements and additions were made by the sultans Qaytbay and Qansuh al-Ghuri, each of whom oversaw numerous repairs and erected minarets that still stand today. It was common practice among the Mamluk sultans to build minarets, perceived as symbols of power and the most effective way of cementing one's position in the Cairo cityscape. The sultans wished to have a noticeable association with the prestigious al-Azhar. Al-Ghuri may also have rebuilt the dome in front of the original mihrab.\nAlthough the mosque-school was the leading university in the Islamic world and had regained royal patronage, it did not overtake the madrasas as the favored place of education among Cairo's elite. Al-Azhar maintained its reputation as an independent place of learning, whereas the madrasas that had first been constructed during Saladin's rule were fully integrated into the state educational system. Al-Azhar did continue to attract students from other areas in Egypt and the Middle East, far surpassing the numbers attending the madrasas. Al-Azhar's student body was organized in riwaqs (fraternities) along national lines, and the branches of Islamic law were studied. The average degree required six years of study.\nBy the 14th century, al-Azhar had achieved a preeminent place as the center for studies in law, theology, and Arabic, becoming a cynosure for students all around the Islamic world. However, only one third of the ulema (Islamic scholars) of Egypt were reported to have either attended or taught at al-Azhar. One account, by Muhammad ibn Iyas, reports that the Salihiyya Madrasa, and not al-Azhar, was viewed as the \"citadel of the ulema\" at the end of the Mamluk Sultanate.\n\nProvince of the Ottoman Empire\nWith the Ottoman annexation of 1517, despite the mayhem their fight to control the city engendered, the Turks showed great deference to the mosque and its college, though direct royal patronage ceased. Sultan Selim I, the first Ottoman ruler of Egypt, attended al-Azhar for the congregational Friday prayer during his last week in Egypt, but did not donate anything to the upkeep of the mosque. Later Ottoman amirs likewise regularly attended Friday prayers at al-Azhar, but rarely provided subsidies for the maintenance of the mosque, though they did on occasion provide stipends for students and teachers. In contrast to the expansions and additions undertaken during the Mamluk Sultanate, only two Ottoman walīs (governors) restored al-Azhar in the early Ottoman period.\nDespite their defeat by Selim I and the Ottomans in 1517, the Mamluks remained influential in Egyptian society, becoming beys (\"chieftains\"), nominally under the control of the Ottoman governors, instead of amirs at the head of an empire. The first governor of Egypt under Selim I was Khai'r Bey, a Mamluk amir who had defected to the Ottomans during the Battle of Marj Dabiq. Though the Mamluks launched multiple revolts to reinstate their Sultanate, including two in 1523, the Ottomans refrained from completely destroying the Mamluk hold over the power structure of Egypt. The Mamluks did suffer losses—both economic and military—in the immediate aftermath of the Ottoman victory, and this was reflected in the lack of financial assistance provided to al-Azhar in the first hundred years of Ottoman rule. By the 18th century the Mamluk elite had regained much of its influence and began to sponsor numerous renovations throughout Cairo and at al-Azhar specifically.\nAl-Qazdughli, a powerful Mamluk bey, sponsored several additions and renovations in the early 18th century. Under his direction, a riwaq for blind students was added in 1735. He also sponsored the rebuilding of the Turkish and Syrian riwaqs, both of which had originally been built by Qaytbay.\nThis marked the beginning of the largest set of renovations to be undertaken since the expansions conducted under the Mamluk Sultanate. Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda was appointed katkhuda (head of the Janissaries) in 1749 and embarked on several projects throughout Cairo and at al-Azhar. Under his direction, three new gates were built: the Bab al-Muzayinīn (the Gate of the Barbers), so named because students would have their heads shaved outside of the gate, which eventually became the main entrance to the mosque; the Bab al-Sa'ayida (the Gate of the Sa'idis), named for the Sa'idi people of Upper Egypt; and, several years later, the Bab al-Shurba (the Soup Gate), from which food, often rice soup, would be served to the students. A prayer hall was added to the south of the original one, doubling the size of the available prayer space. Katkhuda also refurbished or rebuilt several of the riwaqs that surrounded the mosque. Katkhuda was buried in a mausoleum he himself had built in Al-Azhar; in 1776, he became the first person (and the last) to be interred within the mosque since Nafissa al-Bakriyya, a female mystic who had died around 1588.\nDuring the Ottoman period, al-Azhar regained its status as a favored institution of learning in Egypt, overtaking the madrasas that had been originally instituted by Saladin and greatly expanded by the Mamluks. By the end of the 18th century, al-Azhar had become inextricably linked to the ulema of Egypt. The ulema also were able to influence the government in an official capacity, with several sheikhs appointed to advisory councils that reported to the pasha (honorary governor), who in turn was appointed for only one year. This period also saw the introduction of more secular courses taught at al-Azhar, with science and logic joining philosophy in the curriculum. During this period, al-Azhar saw its first non-Maliki rector; Abdullah al-Shubrawi, a follower of the Shafii madhab, was appointed rector. No follower of the Maliki madhab would serve as rector until 1899 when Salim al-Bishri was appointed to the post.\nAl-Azhar also served as a focal point for protests against the Ottoman occupation of Egypt, both from within the ulema and from among the general public. Student protests at al-Azhar were common, and shops in the vicinity of the mosque would often close out of solidarity with the students. The ulema was also on occasion able to defy the government. In one instance, in 1730–31, Ottoman aghas harassed the residents living near al-Azhar while pursuing three fugitives. The gates at al-Azhar were closed in protest and the Ottoman governor, fearing a larger uprising, ordered the aghas to refrain from going near al-Azhar. Another disturbance occurred in 1791 in which the wāli harassed the people near the al-Hussein Mosque, who then went to al-Azhar to demonstrate. The wāli was subsequently dismissed from his post.\n\nFrench occupation\nNapoleon invaded Egypt in July 1798, arriving in Alexandria on July 2 and moving on to Cairo on July 22. In a bid to placate both the Egyptian population and the Ottoman Empire, Napoleon gave a speech in Alexandria in which he proclaimed his respect for Islam and the Sultan:\n\nPeople of Egypt, you will be told that I have come to destroy your religion: do not believe it! Answer that I have come to restore your rights and punish the usurpers, and that, more than the Mamluks, I respect God, his Prophet and the Koran ... Is it not we who have been through the centuries the friends of the Sultan?\n\nOn July 25 Napoleon set up a diwan made up of nine al-Azhar sheikhs tasked with governing Cairo, the first body of Egyptians to hold official powers since the beginning of the Ottoman occupation. This practice of forming councils among the ulema of a city, first instituted in Alexandria, was put in place throughout French-occupied Egypt. Napoleon also unsuccessfully sought a fatwa from the al-Azhar imams that would deem it permissible under Islamic law to declare allegiance to Napoleon.\nNapoleon's efforts to win over both the Egyptians and the Ottomans proved unsuccessful; the Ottoman Empire declared war on 9 September 1798, and a revolt against French troops was launched from al-Azhar on 21 October 1798. Egyptians armed with stones, spears, and knives rioted and looted. The following morning the diwan met with Napoleon in an attempt to bring about a peaceful conclusion to the hostilities. Napoleon, initially incensed, agreed to attempt a peaceful resolution and asked the sheikhs of the diwan to organize talks with the rebels. The rebels, believing the move indicated weakness among the French, refused. Napoleon then ordered that the city be fired upon from the Cairo Citadel, aiming directly at al-Azhar. During the revolt two to three hundred French soldiers were killed, with 6,000 Egyptian casualties. Six of the ulema of al-Azhar were killed following summary judgments laid against them, with several more condemned. Any Egyptian caught by French troops was imprisoned or, if caught bearing weapons, beheaded. The French troops intentionally desecrated the mosque, walking in with their shoes on and guns displayed. The troops tied their horses to the mihrab and ransacked the student quarters and libraries, throwing copies of the Quran on the floor. The leaders of the revolt then attempted to negotiate a settlement with Napoleon, but were rebuffed.\nNapoleon, who had been well respected in Egypt and had earned himself the nickname Sultan el-Kebir (the Great Sultan) among the people of Cairo, lost their admiration and was no longer so addressed. In March 1800, French General Jean Baptiste Kléber was assassinated by Suleiman al-Halabi, a student at al-Azhar. Following the assassination, Napoleon ordered the closing of the mosque; the doors remained bolted until Ottoman and British assistance arrived in August 1801.\nThe conservative tradition of the mosque, with its lack of attention to science, was shaken by Napoleon's invasion. A seminal innovation occurred with the introduction of printing presses to Egypt, finally enabling the curriculum to shift from oral lectures and memorization to instruction by text, though the mosque itself only acquired its own printing press in 1930. Upon the withdrawal of the French, Muhammad Ali Pasha encouraged the establishment of secular learning, and history, math, and modern science were adopted into the curriculum. By 1872, under the direction of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, European philosophy was also added to the study program.\n\nMuhammad Ali Dynasty and British occupation\nFollowing the French withdrawal, Ali, the wāli (governor) and self-declared khedive (viceroy) of Egypt, sought to consolidate his newfound control of the country. To achieve this goal he took a number of steps to limit, and eventually eliminate, the ability of the al-Azhar ulema to influence the government. He imposed taxes on rizqa lands (tax-free property owned by mosques) and madrasas, from which al-Azhar drew a major portion of its income. In June 1809, he ordered that the deeds to all rizqa lands be forfeited to the state in a move that provoked outrage among the ulema. As a result, Umar Makram, the naqib al-ashraf, a prestigious Islamic post, led a revolt in July 1809. The revolt failed and Makram, an influential ally of the ulema, was exiled to Damietta.\nAli also sought to limit the influence of the al-Azhar sheikhs by allocating positions within the government to those educated outside of al-Azhar. He sent select students to France to be educated under a Western system and created an educational system based on that model that was parallel to, and thus bypassed, the system of al-Azhar.\nUnder the rule of Isma'il Pasha, the grandson of Muhammad Ali, major public works projects were initiated with the aim of transforming Cairo into a European styled city. These projects, at first funded by a boom in the cotton industry, eventually racked up a massive debt which was held by the British, providing an excuse for the British to occupy Egypt in 1882 after having pushed out Isma'il Pasha in 1879.\nThe reign of Isma'il Pasha also saw the return of royal patronage to al-Azhar. As khedive, Isma'il restored the Bab al-Sa'ayida (first built by Katkhuda) and the Madrasa al-Aqbughawiyya. Tewfik Pasha, Isma'il's son, who became khedive when his father was deposed as a result of British pressure, continued to restore the mosque. Tewfik renovated the prayer hall that was added by Katkhuda, aligned the southeastern facade of the hall with the street behind it, and remodeled the facade of the Madrasa al-Aqbughawiya along with several other areas of the mosque. Abbas Hilmi II succeeded his father Tewfik as khedive of Egypt and Sudan in 1892, and continued the renovations started by his grandfather Isma'il. He restructured the main facade of the mosque and built a new three-story riwaq in neo-Mamluk style along the mosque's southwestern corner (known as the Riwaq al-'Abbasi) which was completed in 1901. Under his rule, the Committee for the Conservation of Monuments of Arab Art (also known as the \"Comité\"), also restored the original Fatimid sahn. These renovations were both needed and helped modernize al-Azhar and harmonize it with what was becoming a metropolis.\n\nThe major set of reforms that began under the rule of Isma'il Pasha continued under the British occupation. Muhammad Mahdi al-'Abbasi, sheikh al-Azhar, had instituted a set of reforms in 1872 intended to provide structure to the hiring practices of the university as well as to standardize the examinations taken by students. Further efforts to modernize the educational system were made under Hilmi's rule during the British occupation. The mosque's manuscripts were gathered into a centralized library, sanitation for students improved, and a regular system of exams instituted. From 1885, other colleges in Egypt were placed directly under the administration of the al-Azhar Mosque.\nDuring Sa'ad Zaghloul's term as minister of education, before he went on to lead the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, further efforts were made to modify the educational policy of al-Azhar. While a bastion of conservatism in many regards, the mosque was opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, especially as espoused by the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928. The school attracted students from throughout the world, including students from Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia, providing a counterbalance to the influence of the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia.\nUnder the reign of King Fuad I, two laws were passed that reorganized the educational structure at al-Azhar. The first of these, in 1930, split the school into three departments: Arabic language, sharia, and theology, with each department located in buildings outside of the mosque throughout Cairo. Additionally, formal examinations were required to earn a degree in one of these three fields of study. Six years later, a second law was passed that moved the main office for the school to a newly constructed building across the street from the mosque. Additional structures were later added to supplement the three departmental buildings.\nThe ideas advocated by several influential reformers in the early 1900s, such as Muhammad Abduh and Muhammad al-Ahmadi al-Zawahiri, began to take hold at al-Azhar in 1928, with the appointment of Mustafa al-Maraghi as rector. A follower of Abduh, the majority of the ulema opposed his appointment. Al-Maraghi and his successors began a series of modernizing reforms of the mosque and its school, expanding programs outside of the traditional subjects. Fuad disliked al-Maraghi, and had him replaced after one year by al-Zawahiri, but al-Maraghi would return to the post of rector in 1935, serving until his death in 1945. Under his leadership, al-Azhar's curriculum was expanded to include non-Arabic languages and modern sciences. Al-Zawahiri, who had also been opposed by the ulema of the early 1900s, continued the efforts to modernize and reform al-Azhar. Following al-Maraghi's second term as rector, another student of Abduh was appointed rector.\n\nPost 1952 revolution\nFollowing the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, led by the Free Officers Movement of Mohamed Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, in which the Egyptian monarchy was overthrown, the university began to be separated from the mosque. A number of properties that surrounded the mosque were acquired and demolished to provide space for a modern campus by 1955. The mosque itself would no longer serve as a school, and the college was officially designated a university in 1961. The 1961 law separated the dual roles of the educational institution and the religious institution which made judgments heeded throughout the Muslim world. The law also created secular departments within al-Azhar, such as colleges of medicine, engineering, and economics, furthering the efforts at modernization first seen following the French occupation. The reforms of the curriculum have led to a massive growth in the number of Egyptian students attending al-Azhar run schools, specifically youths attending primary and secondary schools within the al-Azhar system. The number of students reported to attend al-Azhar primary and secondary schools increased from under 90,000 in 1970 to 300,000 in the early 1980s, up to nearly one million in the early 1990s, and exceeding 1.3 million students in 2001.\n\nDuring his tenure as Prime Minister, and later President, Nasser continued the efforts to limit the power of the ulema of al-Azhar and to use its influence to his advantage. In 1952, the waqfs were nationalized and placed under the authority of the newly created Ministry of Religious Endowments, cutting off the ability of the mosque to control its financial affairs. He abolished the sharia courts, merging religious courts with the state judicial system in 1955, severely limiting the independence of the ulema. The 1961 reform law, which invalidated an earlier law passed in 1936 that had guaranteed the independence of al-Azhar, gave the President of Egypt the authority to appoint the sheikh al-Azhar, a position first created during Ottoman rule and chosen from and by the ulema since its inception. Al-Azhar, which remained a symbol of the Islamic character of both the nation and the state, continued to influence the population while being unable to exert its will over the state. Al-Azhar became increasingly co-opted into the state bureaucracy after the revolution—independence of its curriculum and its function as a mosque ceased. The authority of the ulema were further weakened by the creation of government agencies responsible for providing interpretations of religious laws. While these reforms dramatically curtailed the independence of the ulema, they also had the effect of reestablishing their influence by integrating them further into the state apparatus. The 1961 reform law also provided the ulema with the resources of the state, though the purse strings were outside of their control. While Nasser sought to subjugate the ulema beneath the state, he did not allow more extreme proposals to limit the influence of al-Azhar. One such proposal was made by Taha Hussein in 1955. Hussein sought to dismantle the Azharite primary and secondary educational system and transform the university into a faculty of theology which would be included within the modern, secular, collegiate educational system. The ulema opposed this plan, though Nasser's choice of maintaining al-Azhar's status was due more to personal political considerations, such as the use of al-Azhar to grant legitimacy to the regime, than on the opposition of the ulema.\nAl-Azhar, now fully integrated as an arm of the government, was then used to justify actions of the government. Although the ulema had in the past issued rulings that socialism is irreconcilable with Islam, following the Revolution's land reforms new rulings were supplied giving Nasser a religious justification for what he termed an \"Islamic\" socialism. The ulema would also serve as a counterweight to the Muslim Brotherhood, and to Saudi Arabia's Wahhabi influence. An assassination attempt on Nasser was blamed on the Brotherhood, and the organization was outlawed. Nasser, needing support from the ulema as he initiated mass arrests of Brotherhood members, relaxed some of the restrictions placed on al-Azhar. The ulema of al-Azhar in turn consistently supported him in his attempts to dismantle the Brotherhood, and continued to do so in subsequent regimes. Despite the efforts of Nasser and al-Azhar to discredit the Brotherhood, the organization continued to function. Al-Azhar also provided legitimacy for war with Israel in 1967, declaring the conflict against Israel a \"holy struggle\".\nFollowing Nasser's death in 1970, Anwar Sadat became President of Egypt. Sadat wished to restore al-Azhar as a symbol of Egyptian leadership throughout the Arab world, saying that \"the Arab world cannot function without Egypt and its Azhar\". Recognizing the growing influence of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sadat relaxed several restrictions on the Brotherhood and the ulema as a whole. However, in an abrupt about-face, in September 1971 a crackdown was launched on journalists and organizations that Sadat felt were undermining or attacking his positions. As part of this effort to silence criticism of his policies, Sadat instituted sanctions against any of the ulema who criticized or contradicted official state policies. The ulema of al-Azhar continued to be used as a tool of the government, sparking criticism among several groups, including Islamist and other more moderate groups. Shukri Mustafa, an influential Islamist figure, accused the ulema of providing religious judgments for the sole purpose of government convenience. When Sadat needed support for making peace with Israel, which the vast majority of the Egyptian population regarded as an enemy, al-Azhar provided a decree stating that the time had come to make peace.\nHosni Mubarak succeeded Sadat as President of Egypt following Sadat's assassination in 1981. While al-Azhar would continue to oblige the government in granting a religious legitimacy to its dictates, the mosque and its clergy were given more autonomy under Mubarak's regime. Under Jad al-Haq, the sheikh of al-Azhar from 1982 until his death in 1994, al-Azhar asserted its independence from the state, at times criticizing policies of the state for instigating extremist Islamist sects. Al-Haq argued that if the government wished al-Azhar to effectively combat groups such as al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya then al-Azhar must be permitted greater independence from the state and for it to be allowed to make religious declarations without interference. Under Mubarak, a number of powers of the state were ceded to al-Azhar. During the 1990s, modifications to existing censorship laws gave al-Azhar the ability to censor both print and electronic media. Though the law stipulates that al-Azhar may only become involved following a complaint, in practice its role has been much more pervasive; for example, television scripts were routinely sent to al-Azhar for approval prior to airing.\nAl-Azhar continues to hold a status above other Sunni religious authorities throughout the world, and as Sunnis form a large majority of the total Muslim population al-Azhar exerts considerable influence on the Islamic world as a whole. In addition to being the default authority within Egypt, al-Azhar has been looked to outside of Egypt for religious judgments. Prior to the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia's King Fahd asked for a fatwa authorizing the stationing of foreign troops within the kingdom, and despite Islam's two holiest sites being located within Saudi Arabia, he asked the head sheikh of al-Azhar instead of the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia. In 2003, Nicolas Sarkozy, at the time French Minister of the Interior, requested a judgment from al-Azhar allowing Muslim girls to not wear the hijab in French public schools, despite the existence of the French Council of Islam. The sheikh of al-Azhar provided the ruling, saying that while wearing the hijab is an \"Islamic duty\" the Muslim women of France are obligated to respect and follow French laws. The ruling drew much criticism within Egypt as compromising Islamic principles to convenience the French government, and in turn the Egyptian government.\n\nPost 2011 revolution\nAl-Azhar was not unaffected by the 2011 Egyptian revolution that saw the removal of Hosni Mubarak as president of Egypt. Student government elections in the months following the revolution resulted in an overwhelming victory for the once banned Muslim Brotherhood. Protests demanding that the military junta ruling Egypt restore the mosque's independence from the state broke out, and the mosque itself commissioned the writing of a draft law that would grant al-Azhar greater independence from the government. Within al-Azhar, debate on its future and rightful role within the state has replaced what had been a mollified single-voice in support of the policies of the Mubarak regime. The various views on al-Azhar's future role in Egypt come from several parties, including leading Islamist organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood, liberal voices that wish to see al-Azhar stand as a bulwark against ultra-conservative Islamists (known as Salafists), and those that hope to see al-Azhar become wholly independent from the state and in complete control of its finances, leadership, and further that it be placed in charge of the religious ministries of the state.\n\nIn 2018 a major restoration of the mosque was completed, financed by both King Abdullah and King Salman of Saudi Arabia. Among the goals of the restoration was the reinforcement of the building's foundations, the restoration of its architectural elements, and upgrades to its infrastructure. The Bab al-Muzayinīn (Gate of the Barbers), formerly one of the main public entrances to the mosque, has been made less accessible as a result of the restoration project.\nIn 2020, representatives from the mosque spoke out against sexual violence in Egypt, prompted by the social media campaign instigated by student Nadeen Ashraf.\n\nArchitecture\nFoundation and structural evolution under Fatimids\nThe original structure of the mosque was 280 feet (85 m) in length and 227 feet (69 m) wide, and was made up of three arcades situated around a courtyard. To the southeast of the courtyard was the original prayer hall, built as a hypostyle hall, five aisles deep, though with its qibla wall slightly off the correct angle. The marble columns supporting the four arcades that made up the prayer hall were reused from sites extant at different times in Egyptian history, from Pharaonic times through Roman rule to Coptic dominance. The different heights of the columns were made level by using bases of varying thickness. The stucco exterior shows influences from Abbasid, Coptic and Byzantine architecture.\n\nUltimately a total of three domes were built, a common trait among early north African mosques, although none of them have survived Al-Azhar's many renovations. The historian al-Maqrizi recorded that in the original dome al-Siqilli inscribed the following:In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate; according to the command for its building from the servant of Allah, His governor abu Tamim Ma'ad, the Imam al-Mu‘izz li-Dīn Allāh, Amir al-Mu'minin, for whom and his illustrious forefathers and his sons may there be the blessings of Allah: By the hand of his servant Jawhar, the Secretary, the Ṣiqillī in the year 360. Gawhar included the honorific Amir al-Mu'minin, Commander of the Faithful, as the Caliphs title and also included his nickname \"the Secretary\" which he had earned serving as a secretary prior to becoming a general.\n K. A. C. Creswell wrote that the original structure certainly had one dome, and likely a second for symmetry.\nThe original mihrab, uncovered in 1933, has a semi-dome above it with a marble column on either side. Intricate stucco decorations were a prominent feature of the mosque, with the mihrab and the walls ornately decorated. The mihrab had two sets of verses from the Quran inscribed in the conch, which is still intact. The first set of verses are the three that open al-Mu’minoon:The next inscription is made up of verses 162 and 163 of al-An'am:These inscriptions are the only surviving piece of decoration that has been definitively traced to the Fatimids.\n\nThe marble paved central courtyard was added between 1009 and 1010. The arcades that surround the courtyard have keel shaped arches with stucco inscriptions. The arches were built during the reign of al-Hafiz li-Din Allah. The stucco ornaments also date to his rule and were redone in 1891. Two types of ornaments are used. The first appears above the center of the arch and consists of a sunken roundel and twenty-four lobes. A circular band of vegetal motifs was added in 1893. The second ornament used, which alternates with the first appearing in between each arch, consists of shallow niches below a fluted hood. The hood rests on engaged columns which are surrounded by band of Qu'ranic writing in Kufic script. The Qu'ranic script was added after the rule of al-Hafiz but during the Fatimid period. The walls are topped by a star shaped band with tiered triangular crenellations. The southeastern arcade of the courtyard contains the main entrance to the prayer hall. A Persian framing gate, in which the central arch of the arcade is further in with a higher rectangular pattern above it, opens into the prayer hall.\nA new wooden door was installed during the reign of al-Hakim in 1009. In 1125, al-Amir installed a new wooden mihrab. An additional dome was constructed during the reign of al-Hafiz li-Din Allah. He additionally ordered the creation of a fourth arcade around the courtyard and had a porch built on the western end of the sahn.\n\nMamluk additions\nThe Fatimid dynasty was succeeded by the rule of Saladin and his Ayyubid dynasty. Initially appointed vizier by the last Fatimid Caliph Al-'Āḍid (who incorrectly thought he could be easily manipulated), Saladin consolidated power in Egypt, allying that country with the Sunni Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad. Distrusting al-Azhar for its Shi'a history, the mosque lost prestige during his rule. However, the succeeding Mamluk dynasty made restorations and additions to the mosque, overseeing a rapid expansion of its educational programs. Among the restorations was a modification of the mihrab, with the installation of a polychrome marble facing.\n\nMadrasa al-Taybarsiyya\nThe Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya, which contains the tomb of Amir Taybars, was built in 1309. Originally intended to function as a complementary mosque to al-Azhar it has since been integrated with the rest of the mosque. The Maliki and Shāfi‘ī madh'hab were studied in this madrasa, though it now is used to hold manuscripts from the library. The only surviving piece from the original is the qibla wall and its polychrome mihrab. Al-Maqrizi reported that the madrasa was used only for studying the Shāfi‘ī while the historian Ibn Duqmaq reported that one of the liwans in the madrasa was reserved for Shāfi‘ī teachings while the other was for Maliki teachings.\nThe madrasa was completely rebuilt by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda, leaving only the southeastern wall and its mihrab untouched. The mihrab was described by K. A. C. Creswell as being \"one of the finest in Cairo\". The niche of the mihrab is 1.13 meters (3.7 ft) wide and 76 centimeters (30 in) deep. On each side of the niche stands a 2.78 meters (9.1 ft) high porphyry column. Above the columns are impost blocks decorated with colored geometrical designs. The semi-dome at the top of the mihrab is set within an outer arch. Surrounding this arch is a molding that forms a rectangular outer frame. This is the first mihrab in Egypt to have this type of frame. Inside the frame are glass mosaics depicting pomegranate trees.\n\nMadrasa and mausoleum of Aqbugha\nA dome and minaret cover the Madrasa al-Aqbughawiyya, which contains the tomb of Amir Aqbugha, which was built in 1339. Intended by its founder, another Mamluk amir called Sayf al-Din Aqbugha 'Abd al-Wahid, to be a stand-alone mosque and school, the madrasa has since become integrated with the rest of the mosque. It includes both a small tomb chamber and a larger hall, both with mihrabs. The entrance, qibla wall, and the mihrabs with glass mosaics are all original, while the pointed dome was rebuilt in the Ottoman period. Parts of the facade were remodeled by Khedive Tewfik in 1888. The top of the minaret was remodelled by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda so as to have a pointed top like the other Ottoman-style minarets he built around the entrances of the mosque, but at some point after 1932 the top was once again refashioned to end with a Mamluk-style finial which we see today.\n\nMadrasa Gawhariyya\nBuilt in 1440, the Madrasa Gawhariyya contains the tomb of Gawhar al-Qanaqba'i, a Sudanese eunuch who became treasurer to the sultan. The floor of the madrasa is marble, the walls lined with cupboards, decoratively inlaid with ebony, ivory, and nacre. The tomb chamber is covered by small stone dome whose exterior is carved with an arabesque pattern, making it one for the earliest domes in Cairo with this type of decoration (later refined in the dome of Qaytay's mausoleum in the Northern Cemetery). The structure was restored between 1980 and 1982.\n\nMinaret of Qaytbay\nBuilt in 1483 or in 1495, it has a square base, a transitional segment leading into an octagonal shaft, then a 10-sided polygon shaft, followed by a cylindrical shaft that consists of 8 brick pillars, each two adjoined by bricks in between. The Minaret of Qaytbay also has three balconies, supported by muqarnas, a form of stalactite vaulting which provide a smooth transition from a flat surface to a curved one (first recorded to have been used in Egypt in 1085), that adorn the minaret. The first shaft is octagonal is decorated with keel-arched panels on each side, with a cluster of three columns separating each panel. Above this shaft is the second octagonal shaft which is separated from the first by a balcony and decorated with plaiting. A second balcony separates this shaft with the final cylindrical shaft, decorated with four arches. Above this is the third balcony, crowned by the finial top of the minaret.\nThe minaret is believed to have been built in the area of an earlier, Fatimid-era brick minaret that had itself been rebuilt several times. Contemporary accounts suggest that the Fatimid minaret had defects in its construction and needed to be rebuilt several times, including once under the direction of Sadr al-Din al-Adhra'i al-Dimashqi al-Hanafi, the qadi al-qudat (Chief Justice of the Highest Court) during the rule of Sultan Baibars. Recorded to have been rebuilt again under Barquq in 1397, the minaret began to lean at a dangerous angle and was rebuilt in 1414 by Taj al-Din al-Shawbaki, the walī and muhtasib of Cairo, and again in 1432. The Qaytbay minaret was built in its place as part of a reconstruction of the entrance to the mosque.\n\nGate of Qaytbay\nDirectly across the courtyard from the entrance from the Bab al-Muzayinīn is the Gate of Qaytbay. It is a refined example of the late Mamuk architectural and decorative style. Built in 1495, this gate leads to the court of the prayer hall.\n\nMinaret of al-Ghuri\nThe double finial minaret was built in 1509 by Qansuh al-Ghuri. Sitting on a square base, the first shaft is octagonal, and four sides have a decorative keel arch, separated from the adjacent sides with two columns. The second shaft, a 12-sided polygon separated from the first by fretted balconies supported by muqarnas, is decorated with blue faience. A balcony separates the third level from the second shaft. The third level is made up of two rectangular shafts with horseshoe arches on each side of both shafts. Atop each of these two shafts rests a finial atop two identical onion shaped bulbs, with a balcony separating the finials from the shafts.\n\nOttoman renovations and additions\nSeveral additions and restorations were made during Ottoman reign in Egypt, many of which were completed under the direction of Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda who nearly doubled the size of the mosque. Three gates were added by Katkhuda, the Bab al-Muzayinīn (see below), which became the main entrance to the mosque, the Bab al-Shurba (the Soup Gate), and the Bab al-Sa'ayida (the Gate of the Sa'idis). To each gate he added a pointed Ottoman-style minaret, of which one was later demolished during the creation of al-Azhar Street. For the Bab al-Muzayinīn, which was adjacent to the Madrasa al-Aqbughiyya, he remodelled the top of Aqbugha's minaret to make it resemble the other Ottoman minarets (though the top was later rebuilt again in a Mamluk style during the 20th century). Several riwaqs were added, including one for the blind students of al-Azhar, as well as refurbished during the Ottoman period. Katkhuda also added an additional prayer hall south of the original Fatimid hall, with an additional mihrab, doubling the total prayer area. His overall work reintegrated the mosque's disparate elements in a relatively unified whole.\n\nBab al-Muzayinīn\nThe Bab al-Muzayinīn (\"Gate of the Barbers\", Arabic: باب المزينين) was built in 1753. Credited to Katkhuda the gate has two doors, each surrounded by recessed arches. Two molded semi-circular arches with tympanums decorated with trefoils stand above the doors. Above the arches is a frieze with panels of cypress trees, a common trait of Ottoman work.\nA free-standing minaret, built by Katkhuda, originally stood outside the gate. The minaret was demolished prior to the opening of al-Azhar street by Tewfik Pasha during modernization efforts which took place throughout Cairo.\n\nCurrent layout and structure\nThe present main entrance to the mosque is the Bab al-Muzayinīn, which opens into the white marble-paved courtyard at the opposite end of the main prayer hall. To the northeast of the Bab al-Muzayinīn, the courtyard is flanked by the façade of the Madrasa al-Aqbughawiyya; the southwestern end of the courtyard leads to the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya. Directly across the courtyard from the entrance to the Bab al-Muzayinīn is the Bab al-Gindi (Gate of Qaytbay), built in 1495, above which stands the minaret of Qaytbay. Through this gate lies the courtyard of the prayer hall.\nThe mihrab has recently been changed to a plain marble facing with gold patterns, replacing some of the Mamluk marble facing, but the stucco carvings in the semi-dome are likely from the Fatimid era.\n\nSee also\nBab al-Futuh\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\nIslam in Egypt\nList of mosques in Cairo\nList of mosques in Egypt\nSabil-Kuttab of Katkhuda\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\nSources\nExternal links\n Media related to Al-Azhar Mosque at Wikimedia Commons",
      "summary": "Al-Azhar Mosque (Arabic: الجامع الأزهر, romanized: al-Jāmiʿ al-ʾAzhar, lit. 'The Resplendent Congregational Mosque'), known in Egypt simply as al-Azhar, is a mosque in the historic Islamic core of the city of Cairo, Egypt. Commissioned as the new capital of the Fatimid Caliphate in 970 CE, it was the first mosque established in a city that eventually earned the nickname \"the City of a Thousand Minarets\". Its name is usually thought to derive from az-Zahrāʾ (lit. 'the shining one'), a title given to Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad.\nAfter its dedication in 972, and with the hiring by mosque authorities of 35 scholars in 989, the mosque slowly developed into what it is today.\nThe affiliated Al-Azhar University is the second oldest continuously run one in the world after Al-Qarawiyyin in Idrisid Fes. It has long been regarded as the foremost institution in the Islamic world for the study of Sunni theology and sharia, or Islamic law. In 1961, the university, integrated within the mosque as part of a mosque school since its inception, was nationalized and officially designated an independent university, Al-Azhar Al-Sharif, following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.\nOver the course of its over a millennium-long history, the mosque has been alternately neglected and highly regarded. Because it was founded as a Shiite Ismaili institution, Saladin and the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty that he founded shunned al-Azhar, removing its status as a congregational mosque and denying stipends to students and teachers at its school. These moves were reversed under the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule numerous expansions and renovations took place. Later rulers of Egypt showed differing degrees of deference to the mosque and provided widely varying levels of financial assistance, both to the school and to the upkeep of the mosque. Today, al-Azhar remains a deeply influential institution in Egyptian society that is highly revered in the Sunni Muslim world and a symbol of Islamic Egypt.",

      "content": "الجامع الازهر هو اهم مساجد مصر على الاطلاق، واحد المعاقل التاريخيه لنشر وتعليم الاسلام كذلك هو واحد من اشهر المساجد الاثريه في مصر والعالم الاسلامي، وجزء من مؤسسه الازهر الشريف يعود تاريخ بنائه الى بدايه عهد الدوله الفاطميه في مصر، بعدما اتم جوهر الصقلي فتح مصر سنه 969م، وشرع في تاسيس القاهره قام بانشاء القصر الكبير واعده لنزول الخليفه المعز لدين الله، وفي اثناء ذلك بدا في انشاء الجامع الازهر ليصلي فيه الخليفه، وليكون مسجداً جامعاً للمدينه حديثه النشاه اسوه بجامع عمرو في الفسطاط وجامع ابن طولون في القطائع، كذلك اعد وقتها ليكون معهداً تعليمياً لتعليم المذهب الشيعي ونشره، فبدا في بناؤه في جمادي الاول 359هـ/970م، واتم بناءه واقيمت اول جمعه فيه في رمضان سنه 361هـ /972م، وعرف بجامع القاهره ورغم ان يد الاصلاح والترميم توالت عليه على مر العصور فغيرت كثيراً من معالمه الفاطميه الا انه يعد اقدم اثر فاطمي قائم بمصر. وقد اختلف المؤرخون في اصل تسميه هذا الجامع، والراجح ان الفاطميين سموه بالازهر تيمناً بفاطمه الزهراء ابنه النبي محمد.\nيعتبر المسجد ثاني اقدم جامعه قائمه بشكل مستمر في العالم بعد جامعه القرويين. ورغم ان جامع عمرو بن العاص في الفسطاط سبقه في وظيفه التدريس حيث كانت تعقد فيه حلقات الدرس تطوعاً وتبرعاً، الا ان الجامع الازهر يعد الاول في مصر في تاديه دور المدارس والمعاهد النظاميه، فكانت دروسه تعطى بتكليف من الدوله ويؤجر عليها العلماء والمدرسين. والقي اول درس فيه في صفر سنه 365هـ/975م على يد علي بن النعمان القاضي في فقه الشيعه، وفي سنه 378هـ/988م قررت مرتبات لفقهاء الجامع واعدت داراً لسكناهم بجواره وكانت عدتهم خمسه وثلاثين رجلاً.\nبعد سقوط الدوله الفاطميه افل نجم الازهر على يد صلاح الدين الايوبي الذي كان يهدف من وراء ذلك الى محاربه المذهب الشيعي ومؤازره المذهب السني، فابطلت الخطبه فيه وظلت معطله مائه عام الى ان اعيدت في عهد السلطان المملوكي الظاهر بيبرس البندقداري. وفي عهد الدوله المملوكيه عاد الازهر ليؤدي رسالته العلميه ودوره الحيوي، فعين به فقهاء لتدريس المذهب السني والاحاديث النبويه وعنى بتجديده وتوسعته وصيانته فعد ذلك العصر الذهبي للازهر، كما اظهر الحكام والاعيان في العصور التاليه اهتماماً ملحوظاً بترميمه وصيانته واوقفت عليه اوقافاً كثيره.\nفي عهد الملك فؤاد الاول صدر القانون رقم 46 لسنه 1930 للازهر والذي بموجبه انشات كليات اصول الدين والشريعه واللغه والعربيه لاحقاً سنه 1933، واصبح للازهر رسميًا جامعه مستقله في عام 1961. وقد اعتبرت جامعه الازهر الاولى في العالم الاسلامي لدراسه المذهب السني والشريعه الاسلاميه. ولا يزال الازهر حتى اليوم مناره لنشر وسطيه الاسلام ومؤسسه لها تاثير عميق في المجتمع المصري ورمزاً من رموز مصر الاسلاميه.\n\nالتسميه\nتاسست مدينه القاهره على يد جوهر الصقلي، وهو قائد فاطمي رومي من اصل يوناني من جزيره صقليه، واطلق عليها اسم المنصوريه، واُعِدَّت المنصوريه لتكون مقراً للخلافه الفاطميه المتواجده في تونس، وقد استخدم المسجد لاول مره في عام 972، وسُمّي في البدايه بجامع المنصوريه، وقد كانت تسميه المسجد باسم المدينه التي يتواجد بها ممارسه شائعه في ذلك الوقت، ومع دخول الخليفه المعز لدين الله لمصر قام بتسميه المدينه بالقاهره، وهكذا اصبح اسم المسجد جامع قاهره، حسب اول نسخه من المصادر العربيه التاريخيه.\nاكتسب المسجد اسمه الحالي، الازهر، في وقت ما بين الخليفه المعز، ونهايه عهد الخليفه الفاطمي الثاني في مصر العزيز بالله، والازهر معناه المشرق وهو صيغه المذكر لكلمه الزهراء، والزَّهْرَاءُ لقبُ السيده فاطمه بنتِ الرسول محمد، زوجه الخليفه علي بن ابي طالب، وقد ادعى المعز وائمه الدوله الفاطميه انهم من سلفهم؛ وهي النظريه الوحيده المتداوله عن سبب تسميه الازهر بهذا الاسم، ومع ذلك، لم تُؤَكَّد هذه النظريه في اي مصدر عربي، وقد استُحْسِن دعمها كلياً، وقد نفتها مصادر غربيه في وقت لاحق.\nيُقدم اخرون نظريه بديله تتمثل في ان اسم المسجد اشتق من الاسماء التي قدمها الخلفاء الفاطميين الى قصورهم القريبه من المسجد، فقد اطلقوا على قصورهم القصور الزاهره تيمنًا بالحدائق الملكيه بها التي اختيرت من قبل العزيز بالله، وبعد ان انتُهِىَ من القصور؛ غُيِّر اسم المسجد من جامع القاهره الى الازهر. اما اشتقاق كلمه جامع من جذر الكلمه العربيه الجامعه، وتعني «الجمع»، ويتم استخدام الكلمه للتعبير عن المساجد التي تجمع الكثير من الناس.\n\nالتاريخ\nفي عصر الدوله الفاطميه (التاسيس)\nفي عهد الخليفه الفاطمي المعز لدين الله الامام الاسماعيلي الرابع، قامت الجيوش الفاطميه بغزو مصر تحت قياده جوهر الصقلي، والذي نجح في انتزاعها من سلاله الاخشيديين، وبامر من الخليفه، اشرف جوهر على بناء المركز الملكي «للخلافه الفاطميه» وجيشها، وقد بنى الازهر كقاعده لنشر مذهب الشيعه الاسماعيليه، والذي يقع بالقرب من مدينه الفسطاط السنيه، وقد اصبحت القاهره مركزاً للطائفه الاسماعيليه الشيعيه، ومقر حكم الدوله الفاطميه. وعلى ذلك امر جوهر ببدء بناء مسجد كبير للمدينه الجديده، وقد بدا العمل في انشائه سنه 970، واتم في سنه 972، فعقدت اول صلاه جمعه فيه في 22 يونيو 972 خلال شهر رمضان.\nسرعان ما اصبح الازهر مركزًا للتعليم، وتخرج منه التصريحات الرسميه وتُعقد به جلسات المحاكم، واصبحت التعاليم الباطنيه الخاصه بالمذهب الاسماعيلي - والتي كانت تعاليم سريه لفتره طويله - متاحه لعامه الناس في الازهر، وقد عين المعز القاضي النعمان بن محمد القاضي، مسؤولاً عن تدريس المذهب الاسماعيلي، وكانت بعض الفصول تُدرَّس في قصر الخليفه، وكذلك في الازهر، مع دورات منفصله للنساء، وخلال عيد الفطر عام 973، رُسِّمَ المسجد مسجدًا رسميًّا لصلاه الجماعه في القاهره بامر من الخليفه المعز وابنه عندما اصبح بدوره الخليفه، وجعلوا خطبه الجمعه خلال شهر رمضان في الازهر.\nكما جعل يعقوب بن كلس - الفقيه والوزير الرسمي الاول للفاطميين - من الازهر مركزًا رئيسيًا لتعليم القانون الاسلامي في عام 988، وفي السنه التاليه، وُظِّفَ 45 عالمًا لاعطاء الدروس، ليتحول الازهر الى جامعه رائده في العالم الاسلامي.\nوُسِّع المسجد اثناء حكم الخليفه العزيز (975–996). ووفقا للمفضل فان العزيز امر بترميم اجزاء من المسجد كانت قد تصدعت، واستكمل الخليفه الفاطمي التالي الحاكم بامر الله ترميم المسجد ووفَّر بابًا خشبيًا جديدًا في عام 1010. ومع ذلك، شهد عهد الحاكم تشييد مسجده الذي سمي باسمه تيمنا به، ويعد تشييد مسجد الحاكم فقد الازهر مركزه كمسجد صلاه الجماعه الاولى في القاهره. وفي ايار/مايو 1009 اصبح مسجد الحاكم بامر الله المكان الوحيد لخطب الخليفه وخطبه الجمعه. وبعد عهد الحاكم استعاد الازهر مكانه في عهد المستنصر، وقد نُفِّذَت اضافات وتجديدات على المسجد، كما اضيفت الكثير من التجديدات في عهد الخلفاء الفاطميين الذين اتوا من بعده.\nاُنشِئت مكتبهٌ ضخمهٌ تابعهٌ للجامع الازهر وهبها الخليفه الفاطمي في 1005 الالاف من المخطوطات التي اعطت قيمه بليغه للمكتبه، وكان ذلك ضمن محاوله الفاطميين بشتى الجهود نشر ممارسه المذهب الاسماعيلي بين الناس، ولكن لم تنجح جهودهم، فالكثير من هذه المخطوطات فُرِقَّت في الفوضى التي تلت سقوط «الدوله الفاطميه»، واصبح الازهر فيما بعد مؤسسه سنيه كبيره.\n\nفي عصر الدوله الايوبيه\nكان صلاح الدين الايوبي الذي اطاح بالفاطميين عام 1171 معادياً لمبادئ التعاليم الشيعيه التي رُوِّجَت في الازهر اثناء الخلافه الفاطميه، لذلك اُهِمَل المسجد خلال حكم السلاله الايوبيه لمصر، وحظر صدر الدين بن درباس الصلاه فيه، وهو قاضٍ عين من قبل صلاح الدين الايوبي، والسبب في هذا المرسوم قد يكون بسبب الفقه الشافعي الذي يرى بعدم جواز خطبتين في بلد واحد، وقد يكون بسبب عدم الثقه في الجامع باعتباره مؤسسه شيعيه، واصبح مسجد الحاكم بامر الله وهو المسجد الذي تُجرى فيه صلاه الجماعه وخطبه الجمعه في القاهره.\nبالاضافه الى تجريد الازهر من مركزه كمسجد صلاه الجماعه، امر صلاح الدين الايوبي ايضاً بازاله شريط فضه ادرجت فيه اسماء الخلفاء الفاطميين عليه من محراب المسجد. كذلك امر بازاله شرائط فضيه مماثله من المساجد الاخرى بلغت قيمتها 5000 درهم. لم يتجاهل صلاح الدين الايوبي تماماً صيانه المسجد، ووفقا للمفضل فان احدى ماذن المسجد رممت خلال حكم صلاح الدين.\nكما افل نجم الازهر كمركز للتعليم الديني،  فسُحِبَ تمويل الطلاب، ولم تعد دروس الفقه تعقد في المسجد، واضطر الاساتذه الذين ذاع صيتهم في عهد الفاطميين الى البحث عن وسائل اخرى لكسب عيشهم. كما تعرضت مكتبه المسجد الضخمه للاهمال، ودمرت مخطوطات التعاليم الفاطميه التي كانت تُدرَّس في الازهر. ومع ذلك ظل الازهر مكاناً لتعليم بعض العلوم الاخرى طوال تلك الفتره، فبينما تم ايقاف فصول الدراسه الرسميه في الجامع، الا انه استمرت الدروس الخاصه لتعليم اللغه العربيه، وتذكر بعض المصادر ان البغدادي درَّس عددًَا من المواضيع مثل القانون والطب في الازهر، وقد امر صلاح الدين بان يُدفع له راتبًا قُدر بـ 30 دينار، ثم ارتفع الى 100 دينار من خلفاء صلاح الدين الايوبي، على الجانب الاخر شجع الايوبيون تدريس الفقه السني في المدارس المعانه، التي بنيت في جميع انحاء القاهره،  وانشئت المؤسسات التعليميه من قبل الحكام السنيين كوسيله لمكافحه ما يعتبرونه هرطقه تعاليم «الشيعه»، وقد كانت هذه الكليات تتراوح في حجمها وتركز على تعليم المذهب السني، وكان لها منهجًا ثابتًا وموحدًا شمل دورات خارج مواضيع دينيه محضه، مثل البلاغه، والرياضيات، والعلوم، وقد بُنيت 26 مدرسه سنيه في مصر فقط خلال عهد صلاح الدين والحكام الايوبيين الذين اتوا من بعده، منها المدرسه الصالحيه.\nاعتمد الازهر في نهايه المطاف الاصلاحات التعليميه التي فرضها صلاح الدين، وتحسنت حظوظه في عهد المماليك، الذين اعادوا رواتب الطلاب ورواتب الشيوخ.\n\nفي عصر الدوله المملوكيه\nاعيد اقامه الصلاه في الازهر اثناء حكم المماليك بامر من السلطان بيبرس في 1266، ومع التوسع السريع في القاهره، والحاجه الى دور المسجد، قام السلطان بيبرس بتجاهل تاريخ الازهر كمؤسسه لنشر المذهب الشيعي الاسماعيلي، وامر بعوده رواتب الطلاب والمعلمين، فضلا عن بدايه العمل لاصلاح المسجد، الذي اهمل منذ ما يقرب من 100 سنه. ووفقا للمفضل، فان الامير عز الدين ايدامور الهيلي بنى منزله بجوار المسجد، لمراقبه اعمال الاصلاح. وقد ذكر تقي الدين المقريزي ان الامير اصلح الجدران والسقف، ووفَّر الحصير الجديد. والقيت الخطبه الاولى منذ عهد الخليفه الفاطمي الحاكم في 16 كانون الثاني/يناير 1266، وقد القيت الخطبه على منبر جديد انتهى تجهيزه قبل الخطبه بخمسه ايام.\n\nفي عام 1302 تسبب زلزال باضرار كبيره للازهر وعدد من المساجد الاخرى في جميع انحاء مصر. وتم تقسيم مسؤوليه اعاده الاعمار بين امراء السلطنه وكان المكلف بترميم الازهر هو الامير سالار، ليتولى بذلك اول اعمال اصلاح منذ عهد بيبرس، وبعد سبع سنوات تم بناء المدرسه الاقبغاويه على طول الجدار الذي يقع في الشمال الغربي من المسجد، وتمت ازاله اجزاء من جدار المسجد لاستيعاب المبنى الجديد، وبدات اشغال بناء مدرسه اخرى، سميت بالمدرسه الطيبرسيه في 1332-1333. وقد اكتمل هذا المبنى في 1339-1340، وبنى ايضا هيكل للمسجد، ونافوره للوضوء. وبنيت كل المدارس والمباني المكمله للازهر، بمداخل وقاعات صلاه منفصله.\nعلى الرغم من ان المسجد قد استعاد مكانته في عهد المماليك، الا ان اعمال التصليح والتوسعه، نفذت باوامر من هم في مواقع اقل من السلطان، وقد تغير هذا في ظل حكم الظاهر برقوق، اول المماليك الشركس، الذي اولى المسجد رعايته المباشره، وخلال اواخر حكم المماليك ادخلت تحسينات واضافات من قبل السلطانين قايتباي وقنصوه الغوري، فاشرف كل منهما على العديد من الاصلاحات وبناء الماذن. وقد كانت هناك ممارسه شائعه بين سلاطين المماليك لبناء الماذن، ويُنظر اليها على انها رمز القوه والطريقه الاكثر فعاليه في تدعيم صوره مدينه القاهره، وتمنى كل سلطان ان تكون له لمسه مرموقه في الازهر.\nعلى الرغم من ان مسجد الازهر كان جامعه رائده في العالم الاسلامي واستعاد الرعايه الملكيه، الا انه لم يتفوق على المدارس الاخرى، كمكان مفضل للتعليم بين النخبه في القاهره. واستمرت سمعه الازهر بوصفه مكانًا مستقلًا للتعليم، في حين ان المدارس الدينيه التي تم بنائها خلال حكم صلاح الدين الايوبي كانت مندمجه تماما في النظام التعليمي للدوله. واستمر الازهر في جذب الطلاب من مناطق اخرى في مصر والشرق الاوسط، وتجاوز اعداد الطلاب به اعداد الذين يحضرون المدارس الدينيه الاخرى، وجرت دراسه فروع الشريعه الاسلاميه بمتوسط مده دراسه ست سنوات. في القرن الرابع عشر حقق الازهر مكانه بارزه باعتباره مركز لدراسات الشريعه والفقه واللغه العربيه، واصبح قبله الانظار للطلاب من جميع انحاء العالم الاسلامي. حتى بلغ عدد من درسوا به حوالي ثلث علماء المسلمين في مصر.\n\nفي عصر الدوله العثمانيه\nخلال بدايه عهد الخلافه العثمانيه سنه 1517 اظهر الاتراك احتراماً كبيراً للمسجد وكُليته، على الرغم من توقف الرعايه الملكيه المباشره له، فقد حضر السلطان سليم الاول بعد دخوله الى مصر صلاه الجمعه في الجامع الازهر، وذلك خلال الاسبوع الاخير له في مصر، كذلك كان يحضر الامراء العثمانيين بانتظام لصلاه الجمعه في الازهر، ولقد وفَّر العثمانيون رواتب للطلاب والمعلمين؛ لكن نادرًا ما يتم القيام باي تطويرات او توسيعات بالمسجد خلال العهد العثماني، على عكس عهد المماليك التي اُجريت فيه الكثير من التوسعات والاضافات.\nظل للمماليك تاثير خاص في المجتمع المصري على الرغم من هزيمتهم على يد سليم الاول والعثمانيين في عام 1517، فاصبحوا بايات وولاه في الدوله العثمانيه، بدلا من امراء واصحاب دوله وامبراطوريه. ويعتبر خاير بك اول حاكم لمصر في عهد سليم الاول بعد يونس باشا، وهو امير مملوكي انشق الى العثمانيين خلال معركه مرج دابق، وعلى الرغم من ان المماليك قاموا بثورات متعدده لاعاده دوله المماليك، بما في ذلك ثورتان في عام 1523، فلم يقم العثمانيون بالاباده الكامله للمماليك على في مصر.\nوقد عانى المماليك من خسائر – اقتصاديه وعسكريه على حد سواء – في اعقاب انتصار العثمانيين، وهذا ينعكس في عدم وجود المساعدات الماليه المقدمه الى الازهر في اول مئه عام من الحكم العثماني. وفي القرن الثامن عشر استطاع نخبه من المماليك استعاده الكثير من نفوذهم، وقامو بتجديدات عديده في جميع انحاء القاهره والازهر.\nوقد قام القازدوغلي بك المملوكي بالعديد من الاضافات والتجديدات في بدايه القرن 18. وتحت ادارته اُضِيف رواق للطلاب المكفوفين في سنه 1735. وقام ايضا باعاده بناء اروقه تركيه وسوريه، وكلاهما قد بنيت في الاصل في عهد قايتباي.\nثم اجريت توسعات كبيره على يد عبد الرحمن كتخدا، وقد عين كتخدا (رئيسا للانكشاريه) في 1749، وشرع في عده مشاريع في جميع انحاء القاهره والازهر. وتحت ادارته بُنِيَت ثلاث بوابات جديده للجامع: باب المزينين (بوابه الحلاقين)، وقد سُمِّى بذلك لانه يخرج منه الطلاب لحلق رؤوسهم، الذي اصبح في نهايه المطاف المدخل الرئيسي للمسجد؛ وباب الصعايده، ومخصص لدخول اهل صعيد مصر، وفي وقت لاحق انشئ باب الشربه، والشربه هي حساء الارز وهي من الاكلات التي غالباً يتم تقديمها الى الطلاب، واضيفت قاعه للصلاه في جنوب المُصلى الاصلي، وضوعفت ايضا حجم المساحه المتاحه للصلاه. وقام كتخدا ايضا بتجديد او اعاده بناء العديد من الاروقه التي تحيط بالمسجد. ودفن كتخدا في الازهر في عام 1776، واصبح كتخدا الشخص الاول (والاخير) الذي يدفن داخل المسجد منذ نفيسه البكريه التي توفيت حوالي عام 1588.\nخلال العهد العثماني استعاد الازهر مركزه كاكبر مؤسسه تعليميه في مصر، متجاوز المدارس الدينيه التي اسسها صلاح الدين الايوبي، وتوسع الازهر بشكل كبير بجهود المماليك. وبنهايه القرن الثامن عشر، اصبح الازهر مرتبطًا ارتباطًا وثيقا بعلماء مصر، وقد كان للعلماء القدره على التاثير على الحكومه بصفه رسميه، وتم تعيين عده شيوخ في المجالس الاستشاريه التي تقدم التقارير الى الباشا، هذه الفتره شهدت ادراج دورات تعليميه اكثر لتُدرَّس في الازهر، مع العلم والمنطق ضُمَّت الفلسفه في المناهج الدراسيه. وخلال هذه الفتره، شهد الازهر اول شيخ للازهر ليس من المذهب المالكي وهو عبد الله الشبراوي الشافعي المذهب، ولم يعد منصب شيخ الازهر من المالكيه حتى عام 1899 عندما اصبح سليم البشري شيخًا للازهر.\nكان الازهر ايضا بمثابه نقطه محوريه للاحتجاجات ضد الولاه اثناء الحكم العثماني لمصر، سواء كانت الاحتجاجات داخل اوساط العلماء او داخل اوساط الطلبه او من عامه الناس. وقد كانت الاحتجاجات الطلابيه التي عقدت في الازهر شائعه بين عامه الناس، واغلقت المحلات التجاريه في محيط المسجد تضامنا مع الطلاب، كما كان ايضا العلماء في بعض الاحيان قادرين على تحدي الحكومه.\nما بين 1730–1731، قام اغاوات الدوله العثمانيه بمضايقه السكان المقيمين بالقرب من الازهر اثناء ملاحقه بعض الهاربين، واغلقت البوابات في الازهر احتجاجا على ذلك، وامر الحاكم العثماني الاغاوات الامتناع عن الذهاب قرب الازهر، خوفاً من قيام انتفاضه كبرى، وقد حدث اضطراب اخر في عام 1791 تسبب فيه مضايقات الوالي قرب مسجد الامام الحسين، ثم ذهب الى الازهر لتبرير موقفه. وقد اقيل الوالي بعد ذلك من منصبه.\n\nالحمله الفرنسيه\nغزا نابليون مصر في يوليو 1798، فوصل الى الاسكندريه يوم 2 يوليو ودخل القاهره يوم 22 يوليو، وفي محاوله لاسترضاء السكان المصريين والامبراطوريه العثمانيه، القى نابليون خطابا في الاسكندريه والذي اعلن فيه عن مدى احترامه للاسلام والسلطان:\n\nوفي 25 يوليو انشا نابليون ديوان يتكون من تسعه شيوخ الازهر، وكلفهم باداره القاهره، وهي اول هيئه رسميه من المصريين منذ بدايه الحكم العثماني، وشكل اول مجلس في الاسكندريه، وشمل لاحقا جميع انحاء مصر الخاضعه للاحتلال الفرنسي، وقد سعى نابليون ايضا لفتوى من ائمه الازهر، التي من شانها تنص بجواز الولاء لنابليون بموجب الشريعه الاسلاميه، لكن من غير جدوى.\nوباءت جهود نابليون للهيمنه على المصريين والعثمانيين بالفشل؛ فقد اعلنت الامبراطوريه العثمانيه الحرب في 9 سبتمبر 1798، وبدات ثوره ضد القوات الفرنسيه من الازهر في 21 اكتوبر 1798، وقام المصريون المسلحون بالحجاره والرماح فقط باعمال بطوليه ضد جيش نابليون الجرار، وفي صباح اليوم التالي اجتمع الديوان مع نابليون في محاوله للتوصل الى نهايه سلميه للاعمال العدائيه، وقد غضب نابليون في البدايه، لكنه وافق لمحاوله التوصل الى حل سلمي، وطلب من شيوخ الديوان تنظيم محادثات مع الثوار، وقد اعتبر الثوار هذه الخطوه تدل على ضعف الفرنسيين ورفضوها، وعلى اثر هذا امر نابليون باطلاق النار على المدينه من قلعه القاهره، وتصويب النار على الازهر مباشره. وخلال التمرد قتل حوالي ثلاثمائه جندي فرنسي، واُصيب 3,000 مصري، وقتل سته من علماء الازهر بعد ان حُكم بالاعدام عليهم، وقد القت القوات الفرنسيه القبض على كل مصري شارك في المظاهرات ووضع في السجن، واذا وجدوا عنده سلاح قُطع راسه، وقد دنست القوات الفرنسيه المسجد عمدًا، ومشوا فيه باحذيتهم والبنادق المعروضه. وقامت القوات بربط خيولها في المحراب ونهب ارباع الطلاب والمكتبات، ورموا نسخًا من القران على الارض. ثم حاول قاده الثوره التفاوض على التسويه مع نابليون، ورُفِضَ طلبهم.\nوفقد نابليون احترام واعجاب المصريين بعد قيام الثوره، بعد ان كان يحظى باحترام كبير في مصر، وبعد ان لُقِّب بـ السلطان العظيم بين الناس في القاهره، وفي مارس 1800، اُغتيل الجنرال الفرنسي جان بابتيست كليبر على يد سليمان الحلبي، وهو طالب في الازهر. وبعد عمليه الاغتيال، امر نابليون باغلاق المسجد، وظلت ابوابه مغلقه حتى وصول المساعدات العثمانيه والبريطانيه في اغسطس 1801، وقد فقد المسجد الكثير من محتوياته بغزو نابليون.\nاستفاد الازهر كثيرًا من ابتكار اله الطباعه الحديثه، التي اضافت بدورها بُعْدًا اخر في مجال التعليم، وقد تحولت المناهج الدراسيه من محاضرات عن طريق الفم وتحفيظ للدرس بالنص الى محاضرات مطبوعه، ولقد اكتسب مطبعه خاصه به في عام 1930.\nبعد انسحاب الفرنسيين، شجع محمد على باشا على ادخال التعليم غير الديني في الازهر مثل دراسه التاريخ والرياضيات والعلوم الحديثه، وقد اعتُمِد على المناهج الدراسيه التي كانت تلقى قبل عام 1872، تحت اشراف جمال الدين الافغاني، كما اضيفت الفلسفه الاوروبيه لمناهج الدراسه.\n\nمحمد علي والاحتلال البريطاني\nبعد انسحاب الفرنسيين، قام الوالي محمد علي بتعيين نفسه خديويًّا (اميرًا) على مصر، وسعى لتوطيد سيطرته على مصر الحديثه التي اسسها، ولتحقيق هذه الغايه فقد اتخذ عددا من الخطوات للحد، والقضاء على قدره علماء الازهر للتاثير على الحكومه. وفرض ضرائب على اراضي رزقه (وهي اراضٍ تابعه للمساجد) والمدارس الدينيه، كما قام ايضا باخذ جزء كبير من مداخيل الازهر،  وفي يونيو 1809، امر بمصادره جميع اراضي رزقه وضمها الى املاك الدوله في خطوه اثارت غضبًا واسعًا بين العلماء، ونتيجه لذلك، قام عمر مكرم بثوره في يوليو 1809، وقد فشلت الثوره ونفي مكرم، حليف العلماء، الى دمياط.\nسعى محمد علي ايضا الى الحد من نفوذ شيوخ الازهر بتوزيع المناصب داخل الحكومه لاولئك الذين تلقوا تعليمهم خارج الازهر. وبعث الطلاب الى فرنسا تحديدًا، لينشئوا تحت نظام تعليمي غربي، وقام بانشاء نظام تعليمي يستند الى هذا النموذج وموازيًا اليه، وهكذا تجاوز نظام الازهر.\nواستهلت مشاريع الاشغال العامه الرئيسيه تحت حكم اسماعيل باشا، حفيد محمد علي، بهدف تحويل مدينه القاهره الى الطراز الاوروبي، في البدايه كانت هذه المشاريع مموله من مصنع القطن، لكنه استدان ديون ضخمه من البريطانيين، واصبحت تلك الديون ذريعه لبريطانيا باحتلال مصر عام 1882، بعد اجبار اسماعيل باشا على دفعها في عام 1879.\nكما شهد عهد اسماعيل باشا ايضا عوده الرعايه الملكيه الساميه الى الازهر، واستعاد اسماعيل باب الصعايده (بني لاول مره في عهد كتخدا) والمدرسه الاقبغاويه، كما واصل توفيق باشا بن اسماعيل - الذي اصبح بدوره الخديوي بعد ان اطاح بوالده نتيجه للضغط البريطاني - استعاده المسجد، وقام توفيق بتجديد قاعه الصلاه التي اضيفت في عهد كتخدا، بمحاذاه الواجهه الجنوبيه الشرقيه من القاعه والشارع الذي يقع وراءها، واعاده تشكيل عده مناطق اخرى من المسجد. ونجح ابن توفيق، عباس الثاني خديوي مصر والسودان في عام 1892، باعاده هيكله الواجهه الرئيسيه للمسجد وبنى الرواق الجديد واستمرت التجديدات التي كتبها جده اسماعيل. وتحت حكمه، واستعيدت لجنه حفظ الاثار الفنيه العربيه (شكلت في البدايه تحت الاحتلال الفرنسي)، وايضا استعاد الصحن الفاطمي الاصلي.\nكما استمرت مجموعه كبيره من الاصلاحات التي بدات في ظل حكم اسماعيل باشا في ظل الاحتلال البريطاني، ومع قدوم شيخ الازهر محمد المهدي العباسي، وضعت مجموعه من الاصلاحات تهدف الى تشكيل هئيه تدريس هيكل تعليمي لتوحيد امتحانات الطلاب في عام 1872، وقد بذل الجهد لتحديث النظام التعليمي تحت اداره حلمي خلال الاحتلال البريطاني، وجُمِعَت مخطوطات المسجد في مكتبه مركزيه، وحُسِّنَت ايضا المرافق الصحيه للطلاب، ووضع نظام للامتحانات. وفي عام 1885، وضعت كليات اخرى في مصر مباشره تحت اداره الجامع الازهر.\nوخلال فتره سعد زغلول كوزير للتعليم، قبل ان ينتقل الى قياده الثوره المصريه عام 1919، بُذلت جهود اخرى لتعديل السياسه التعليميه للازهر، وايده التيار المحافظ في سياسته، في حين لقي سعد زغلول معارضه تيارات اخرى مثل جماعه الاخوان المسلمون التي تاسست عام 1928، وقد جذبت المدرسه طلاب من جميع انحاء العالم، بما في ذلك طلاب من جنوب شرق اسيا وخاصه اندونيسيا.\nفي عهد الملك فؤاد الاول، صدر قانونان من شانهما تنظيم الهيكل التعليمي للازهر. واول هذه القوانين، في عام 1930، وينص على تقسيم المدرسه الى ثلاثه اقسام: اللغه العربيه، الشريعه، واصول الدين، وان يقع كل قسم في مبنى خارج المسجد في جميع انحاء القاهره، ويُمتحن الطلاب امتحانًا رسميًا لكسب شهاده في واحده من هذه المجالات الثلاثه من الدراسه، وبعد ست سنوات، صدر القانون الثاني الذي نقل المكتب الرئيسي للمدرسه لمبنى شُيِّد حديثًا موازيًا لشارع المسجد، واضيفت هياكل اضافيه في وقت لاحق لاستكمال ادارات المباني الثلاثه.\nكما بدات الافكار التي ينادي بها العديد من الاصلاحيين تزداد في مدخل القرن العشرين، امثال محمد عبده ومحمد الاحمدي الظواهري وغيرهم من المفكرين، واخذت هذه الافكار تترسخ في الازهر، وفي عام 1928 عُيِّن محمد مصطفى المراغي شيخًا للازهر وهو من اتباع محمد عبده. وقد عارضت الغالبيه العظمى من العلماء تعيينه، وبدات اداره المراغي وخلفائه سلسله من الاصلاحات والتحديثات التي طرات على المسجد وجامعته، وتوسيع المناهج التعليميه خارج اطار الموضوعات التقليديه. وقد كره الملك فؤاد المراغي، وقام باستبداله بعد سنه واحده من تعيينه وعين الظواهري مكانه، ولكن المراغي عاد الى منصب شيخًا للازهر في عام 1935، وظل بمركزه حتى وفاته في عام 1945. وتحت قيادته وُسِّعَت مناهج الازهر لتشمل لغات غير العربيه والعلوم الحديثه.\n\nالازهر وثوره يوليو\nفي اعقاب الثوره المصريه عام 1952، التي قامت بها حركه الضباط الاحرار بقياده محمد نجيب وجمال عبد الناصر، والتي ادت الى سقوط النظام الملكي المصري، خلال هذه الفتره تمت مراحل فصل الجامعه عن المسجد. وقد تم ضم الكثير من الممتلكات التي تحيط بالمسجد وهدمها لتوفير مساحه للحرم الحديث، وفي عام 1955، لم يعد المسجد بمثابه مدرسه، وتم انشاء كليات رسميه للجامعه في عام 1961، وفي عام 1961 صدر قانون ينص على فصل الادوار المزدوجه للمؤسسه التعليميه والمؤسسه الدينيه التي لقيت اذانا صاغيه في جميع انحاء العالم الاسلامي، ونص القانون على انشاء كليات غير دينيه داخل الازهر، مثل كليات الطب والهندسه، والاقتصاد، وتعزيز الجهود في التحديث للمره الاولى بعد الاحتلال الفرنسي، وقد ادت اصلاحات المناهج الى نمو هائل في عدد الطلاب المصريين الذين حضروا الى المدارس، وعلى وجه الخصوص الشباب الذين يحضرون المدارس الابتدائيه والمدارس الثانويه داخل منظومه الازهر، وبحسب احصائيات عدد الطلبه الذين حضروا الى مدارس الازهر الابتدائيه والمدارس الثانويه ارتفع من اقل 90,000 طالب في عام 1970 الى 300,000 طالب في اوائل الثمانينات، ثم الى ما يقرب من مليون طالب في اوائل التسعينات، وتجاوز 1.3 مليون طالب في عام 2001.\n\nوقد واصل جمال عبد الناصر خلال فتره توليه منصب رئيس الوزراء، ثم الرئيس، جهوده المبذوله للحد من سلطه علماء الازهر والى استخدام نفوذهم لمصلحته، وفي عام 1952 اُمِّمَت الاوقاف ووضعت تحت سلطه وزاره الاوقاف التي انشئت حديثًا، مما قطع من قدره المسجد للسيطره على الشؤون الماليه، والغى المحاكم الشرعيه، ودمج المحاكم الدينيه مع النظام القضائي للدوله في عام 1955، مما يحد بشده من استقلال العلماء، وفي عام 1961 صدر قانون الاصلاح، الذي ينص على ابطال قانون استقال الازهر عام 1936، واصبح لرئيس مصر سلطه تعيين شيخ الازهر، وهو موقف انشئ لاول مره اثناء الحكم العثماني.\n\nوواصل الازهر، الذي ظل رمزاً للطابع الاسلامي للامه والدوله، التاثير على السكان بينما لم يصبح قادرًا على فرض ارادته على الدوله. وتعرض الازهر بشكل متزايد الى بيروقراطيه الدوله بعد الثوره وتوقف استقلال منهجه ووظيفته كمسجد، كذلك اُضعِفت سلطه العلماء بانشاء الوكالات الحكوميه المسؤوله عن تقديم تفسيرات للقوانين الدينيه، في حين ان هذه الاصلاحات قُلِّصَت جذريا باستقلال سلطه العلماء، كما كان لها تاثير باعاده ترسيخ نفوذهم بادماجهم في جهاز الدوله، كما ينص قانون اصلاح العلماء لعام 1961، بتخصيص موارد الدوله لهم، مع ان خزينه المال كانت خارج سيطره الازهر، في حين سعى جمال عبد الناصر الى اخضاع العلماء تحت الدوله، لم يسمح بالمزيد من الاقتراحات المتطرفه للحد من نفوذ الازهر. مثل اقتراح طه حسين في عام 1955. حيث سعى حسين الى تفكيك نظام الازهر للتعليم الابتدائي والثانوي وتحويل الجامعه الى كليه للشريعه ضمن النظام التعليمي الحديث، وقد عارضه العلماء على هذه الخطه، على الرغم من ان خيار عبد الناصر للحفاظ على مركز الازهر يرجع الى اعتبارات سياسيه شخصيه، مثل استخدام الازهر بمنح الشرعيه للنظام، وتجتب معارضه العلماء.\n\nواصبح الازهر في هذه الفتره بشكل كامل كذراع للحكومه، ثم استخدم لتبرير تصرفات الحكومه. على الرغم من ان العلماء كانوا قد اصدروا في وقت سابق ان الاشتراكيه لا يمكنها ان تتوافق مع الاسلام، لكن بعد الثوره والاستصلاح الزراعي، اصدر علماء الازهر احكامًا جديده تتوافق مع عبد الناصر مع تبريرها دينيًا وسموها الاشتراكيه الاسلاميه، واصبح استخدام العلماء بمثابه قوه موازيه لجماعه الاخوان المسلمين، والحد من النفوذ الوهابي في المملكه العربيه السعوديه، والقى باللائمه في محاوله اغتيال ناصر على جماعه الاخوان المسلمين وحُظِرَت، وقد احتاج عبد الناصر الى دعم من العلماء كما انه بادر باعتقالات جماعيه من اعضاء جماعه الاخوان المسلمين،  وعلى اثره خففت بعض القيود المفروضه على الازهر. وبدورهم ايد علماء الازهر عبد الناصر في محاولاته لتفكيك جماعه الاخوان المسلمين، واستمر الحال على ذلك في الانظمه اللاحقه، وعلى الرغم من الجهود المبذوله من الازهر لتشويه سمعه الاخوان المسلمين، استمرت جماعه الاخوان المسلمين في عملها، كما قدم الازهر ايضا شرعيه للحرب مع الكيان الصهيوني في عام 1967، معلنا الجهاد ضد الكيان الصهيوني.\nبعد وفاه عبد الناصر في عام 1970، واصبح انور السادات رئيسا لمصر، وعبَّر السادات عن رغبته باستعاده الازهر كرمز للقياده المصريه في جميع انحاء العالم العربي، قائلا ان: «العالم العربي لا يمكن ان بعمل بدون مصر والازهر»، وزاد هذا الاعتراف من النفوذ المتزايد لجماعه الاخوان المسلمين، وقد خفف السادات عددا من القيود المفروضه على الاخوان والعلماء ككل. ومع ذلك، اطلقت حمله في سبتمبر 1971 من الصحفيين والمنظمات على السادات وهاجموا مواقفه بشكل مفاجئ، فوضع السادات عقوبات ضد العلماء الذين انتقدوا السياسات الرسميه للدوله. كما واصل استخدام علماء الازهر كاداه من الحكومه، مما اثار انتقادات بين عده مجموعات، بما في ذلك الجماعات الاسلاميه وغيرها الاكثر اعتدالا، اتهم شكري مصطفى علماء الازهر بتقديم الاحكام الدينيه لغرض وحيد وهو راحه الحكومه، وعندما اقدم السادات لعقد السلام مع اسرائيل، اعتبرته الغالبيه العظمى من السكان المصريين خائنًا، وقدَّم الازهر بيانًا ينص على ان الوقت قد حان لصنع السلام.\nوبعد اغتيال السادات، اصبح حسني مبارك رئيسا لمصر في عام 1981، وواصل الازهر بمنح الشرعيه الدينيه لما تمليه الحكومه، وقد اعطى نظام مبارك نتيجه ذلك الاستقلاليه الى الجامع الازهر وعلمائه، ثم اصبح جاد الحق علي جاد الحق شيخًا للازهر في الفتره من 1982 حتى وفاته في عام 1996، وقد اكد رغبته باستقلال الازهر عن الدوله كغيره من علماء الازهر، وقال جاد الحق ان الحكومه اذا رغبت من الازهر مكافحه فعاله للجماعه الاسلاميه في مصر، يجب عليها ان تعطي للازهر اكبر قدر من الاستقلاليه عن الدوله وان يكون للازهر صوتًا لا تتدخل فيه الدوله، وفي عهد مبارك، تنازل عن عدد من سلطات الدوله الى الازهر، وخلال بدايه التسعينات قُدِّمت تعديلات على قوانين الرقابه الموجوده واعطي للازهر القدره على فرض رقابه على كل المطبوعات والاعلام الالكتروني. على الرغم من ان القانون ينص على ان الازهر قد يشارك في كتابه شكوى فقط، على سبيل المثال، ارسلت النصوص التلفزيونيه بشكل روتيني الى الازهر للموافقه عليها قبل ان تُبث.\nواصل الازهر عقد مراكز عليا للسلطات الدينيه السنيه الاخرى في جميع انحاء العالم، بما ان السنيين يشكلون الاغلبيه العظمى من مجموع السكان المسلمين، وقد كان للازهر تاثير كبير على العالم الاسلامي برمته، بالاضافه الى كونه السلطه الدينيه داخل مصر، وقد طلب من الازهر استشارات للاحكام الدينيه من خارج مصر. فمثلا قبل «حرب الخليج»، طلب فهد بن عبد العزيز ملك المملكه العربيه السعوديه من شيخ الازهر بدلاً من مفتي عام المملكه العربيه السعوديه، فتوى تاذن بتمركز قوات اجنبيه داخل المملكه، على الرغم من تواجد اثنين من اقدس الاماكن الاسلاميه داخل المملكه العربيه السعوديه، وفي عام 2003 طلب وزير الداخليه الفرنسي نيكولا ساركوزي اصدار فتوى من الازهر للسماح للفتيات المسلمات بعدم ارتداء الحجاب في المدارس العامه الفرنسيه، على الرغم من وجود «المجلس الفرنسي للاسلام». وقدم شيخ الازهر بيانًا قائلا فيه انه في حين ان ارتداء الحجاب واجب اسلامي، فان المراه المسلمه في فرنسا ملزمه باحترام واتباع القوانين الفرنسيه. وقد تعرض شيخ الازهر للكثير من الانتقادات داخل مصر، واعتُبرت الفتوى تنازلًا عن المبادئ الاسلاميه لارضاء الحكومه الفرنسيه.\n\nبعد عام 2011\nلم يتاثر الازهر بالثوره المصريه التي شهدت ازاله حسني مبارك كرئيس لمصر عام 2011، واسفرت انتخابات الحكومه الطلابيه في الاشهر التي تلت الثوره في فوز ساحق لجماعه الاخوان المسلمين، بعدها اندلعت احتجاجات تطالب المجلس العسكري الحاكم لمصر باستعاده استقلال المسجد عن الدوله، وقد كُلِّف المسجد نفسه بكتابه مشروع قانون من شانه منح الازهر استقلالا اكبر من الحكومه، في غضون ذلك، حل مؤتمر نقاش في الازهر حول مستقبله ودوره الشرعي داخل الدوله، وقد ادت وجهات النظر المختلفه حول دور الازهر في المستقبل في مصر تاتي من عده احزاب، بما في ذلك المنظمات الاسلاميه الرائده مثل الاخوان المسلمين، والاصوات الليبراليه التي ترغب في رؤيه الازهر يقف كحصن ضد المتطرفين، ويامل الازهر ان يصبح مستقلاً تمامًا عن الدوله.\n\nالعماره\nالهندسه المعماريه للازهر ترتبط ارتباطًا وثيقا بتاريخ القاهره. واستخدمت فيها مواد ماخوذه من فترات متعدده من التاريخ المصري، والتي استفادت من اسلوب العماره الفاطمي في افريقيه، ثم حصل المسجد على اضافات وتوسعات من الحكام الذي تعاقبوا على مصر، فتاثرت عماره الجامع باساليب معماريه عده من داخل وخارج مصر على حد سواء، مُزجت هذه التاثيرات معًا، وظهرت معها اساليب معماريه جديده كانت مصدر الهام فيما بعد، مثل القباب التي بُنيت الفتره العثمانيه والماذن التي بناها المماليك.\nبُني المسجد في البدايه على شكل قاعه للصلاه مع خمسه ممرات وفناء مركزي متواضع، ومنذ ذلك الحين وُسِّع المسجد عده مرات مع منشات اضافيه محيطه بالمبنى الاصلي، فاضيفت العديد من الماذن من قبل المماليك، واضيفت البوابات اثناء الحكم العثماني، واستُبدل المحراب بمحراب جديد، نجت بعض الماذن والقباب الاصليه وظلت حتى الان، وبعضها اعيد بناؤها عده مرات.\n\nالعهد الفاطمي\nكان الهيكل الاصلي للجامع الازهر 280 قدمًا (85 مترًا) في الطول و227 قدمًا (69 مترًا) في العرض، ويتالف من ثلاثه اروقه معمده تقع حول فناء، وفي جهه الجنوب الشرقي من الفناء، بنيت قاعه الصلاه الاصليه على هيئه بهو معمد، مع خمسه ممرات عميقه، بقياس 260 قدمًا (79 م) في الطول و75 قدمًا (23 م) في العرض، وكان جدار القبله منحرفًا قليلاً عن الزاويه الصحيحه، واعيد استخدام الاعمده الرخاميه لدعم الاروقه الاربعه التي تؤدي لقاعه الصلاه من مواقع موجوده في اوقات مختلفه في التاريخ المصري، من العصور الفرعونيه مرورًا بالحكم الروماني وحتى الحقبه القبطيه، مما ادى الى اختلاف ارتفاعات مستوى الاعمده لاستخدامها قواعد متفاوته السماكه، كما تظهر في الجص تاثيرات من العماره العباسيه والقبطيه والبيزنطيه.\nوقد بني في النهايه ثلاث قباب، وهي سمه مشتركه بين اوائل المساجد في شمال افريقيا، ولم ينجُ ايا منها خلال التجديدات التي لحقت بالازهر، وسجل المؤرخ المقريزي انه في القبه الاصليه التي بناها الصقلي كتب فيها:\n\nوقد لقي الصقلي رعايه شرفيه من المعز، وقد عينه، «سكرتيره الخاص» ويعتبر الصقلي اول شخص يحصل على منصب سكرتير قبل ان يصبح منصب عام.\nالمحراب الاصلي، كشف عنه في عام 1933، لديه شبه قبه فوقه مع عمود من الرخام في كل جانب، وقد كانت الزخارف الجصيه المعقده سمه بارزه في المسجد، فقد كانت كل الجدران والمحراب مزينه بالنقوش، وقد كتب على المحراب مجموعتان من الايات القرانيه المدرجه في قوقعته، والتي لا تزال سليمه، اول مجموعه من الايات هي اول ثلاث ايات من سوره المؤمنون:\n\nالمجموعه الثانيه من الايات 162، 163 من سوره الانعام:\n\nهذه النقوش هي القطعه الوحيده الباقيه من الديكور التي ترجع الى العهد الفاطمي.\n\nاضيفت الساحه المركزيه المعبَّده من رخام بين 1009 و1010، واضيفت ايضا الممرات التي تحيط الفناء لها عارضه مقوسه الشكل مع نقوش جصيه. وقد بنيت الاقواس في عهد الحافظ لدين الله من الحلي والجص، وقد اعيد بناؤها في عام 1891 باستخدام نوعين من الحلي،  يظهر اعلى مركز القوس الاول ويتكون من رونديل غارق والفصوص الاربعه والعشرين. واضيفت زمره دائريه من زخارف نباتيه في عام 1893، اما الزخرفه الثانيه المستخدمه، التي هي ما بين كل قوس، تتكون من منافذ ضحله تحت غطاء مخدد تشكل سقف اعمده متشاركه، والتي تحيط بها مجموعه من الكتابات القرانيه بالخط الكوفي. اضيفت النصوص القرانيه بعد حكم الحافظ خلال الفتره الفاطميه، وتصدرت الجدران على شكل نجمه مع زينه للشرفه على ثلاث مستويات، الممر الجنوبي الشرقي من الفناء يحتوي على المدخل الرئيسي الى قاعه الصلاه. بوابه تاطير الفارسي، التي قوس مركزها لها ممر مستطيل تفتح الى قاعه الصلاه.\nرُكِّب باب خشبي جديد ومحراب خشبي جديد في عهد الحاكم بامر الله في 1009، وفي سنه 1125، شيدت قبه اضافيه في عهد الحافظ لدين الله، بالاضافه الى ذلك، فقد امر بانشاء ممر رابع حول الفناء، اما الشرفه فقد بنيت على الطرف الغربي من الصحن.\n\nالاضافات المملوكيه\nعين صلاح الدين في البدايه وزيرا من طرف اخر الخلفاء الفاطميين العاضد لدين الله الذي كان يثق بصلاح الدين، وانهارت الدوله الفاطميه خلال عهد صلاح الدين الايوبي وسلالته، وقام صلاح الدين الايوبي في مصر، بالتحالف مع الخلافه العباسيه السنيه في بغداد، ولعدم ثقته بالازهر الشيعي تاريخا، خسر المسجد مكانته اثناء فتره حكم صلاح الدين، ومع ذلك، استعاد المسجد مكانته خلال فتره المماليك الذين قاموا بسلسله من الترميمات والاضافات للمسجد، والاشراف على التوسع السريع في مناهجه التعليميه، ومن بين الترميمات التي قام بها المماليك تعديل المحراب، مع تركيب الرخام الملون لواجهته.\nوفي عام 1339، بنيت قبه ومئذنه لتغطيه المدرسه الاقبغاويه، التي تحتوي على قبر الامير اقبغا عبد الواحد، كانت في البدايه مسجدُا قائمًا بذاته ومدرسه، ثم اصبحت مدرسه متكامله ودُمجت في الجامع الازهر، اما: المدخل، وجدار القبله، والفسيفساء والزجاج في المحراب مع القبه الاصليه يرجع تاريخها الى الفتره العثمانيه.\nفي عام 1440، بنيت المدرسه الجوهريه وتحتوي على قبر الامير جوهر القنقبائي، الذي كان يشغل منصب الخازندار (المشرف على خزائن الاموال السلطانيه) اثناء حكم السلطان المملوكي الاشرف سيف الدين برسباي، وكانت ارضيه المدرسه من الرخام، والجدران تصطف مع الخزائن، وزينت المطعمه مع خشب الابنوس والعاج والصدف، وغطيت حجره القبر بواسطه قبه صغيره مزخرفه.\n\nالمدرسه الطيبرسيه\nوفي عام 1309، بنيت المدرسه الطيبرسيه، التي تحتوي على قبر الامير علاء الدين طيبرس،  وقد بنيت اصلا لتعمل كمسجد مكمل للازهر ومنذ ذلك الحين دمجت مع بقيه المسجد،  ودرست المذاهب المالكيه والشافعيه في هذه المدرسه، وتستخدم المدرسه الان للاحتفاظ بالمخطوطات من المكتبه.\nذكر المقريزي ان المدرسه كانت تستخدم فقط لدراسه المذهب الشافعي، في حين ان مؤرخا عن ابن دقماق ذكر ان واحدا من ايوانات المدرسه كان لتعاليم الشافعي حين ان الاخر كان لتعاليم المالكي.\nاعيد بناء المدرسه بالكامل في عهد عبد الرحمن كتخدا، ولم يتبق سوى الجدار الجنوبي الشرقي والمحراب وهي القطع الوحيده الاصليه الباقيه من عهد الامير علاء الدين طيبرس،  والمحراب بقياس 1.13 مترا في العرض و76 سم في العمق. وعلى كل جانب من المحراب يقف عمود من الحجر السماقي بارتفاع 2.78 متر (9.1 قدم). وتوجد فوق الاعمده رسمات مزخرفه باشكال هندسيه ملونه، واضيفت نصف قبه في اعلى المحراب داخل القوس الخارجي، ويحيط بهذا اطار خارجي مستطيل، ويعتبر هذا المحراب الاول في مصر الذي استخدم هذا النوع من الاطار،  وقد وصف المؤرخ كريزويل هذا المحراب بانه «واحده من ارقى التحف المعماريه في القاهره.»\n\nمئذنه قايتباي\nبنيت مئذنه قايتباي في عام 1483، وهي على شكل عمود اسطواني ينقسم الى جزئين مثمنين، ومئذنه قايتباي تتكون من ثلاث شرفات، تدعمها مقرنصات، وشكل سقفها معقود الهوابط الذي يوفر الانتقال السلس من سطح مستو لمنحني واحد، وسجل اول استخدام له في مصر في 1085، الجزء السفلي مثمن، زُين بلوحات عارضه مقوسه من كل جانب، مع مجموعه من ثلاثه اعمده لتفصل كل لوحه، اما المنطقه الوسطى ايضا مثمنه فصلت عن الجزء السفلي بشرفه زينت بضفر، الشرفه الثانيه تفصل هذا الجزء مع جزء اسطواني في نهايه المئذنه، وزينت باربعه اقواس. فوق هذا توجد الشرفه الثالثه، التي توجد في اعلى جزء من المئذنه.\nويعتقد ان المئذنه اقيمت في موضع مئذنه الطوب الفاطميه، التي اعيد بناؤها عده مرات. الحسابات المعاصره تشير الى ان المئذنه الفاطميه كان بها عيوب عند بنائها، ويلزم اعاده بنائها عده مرات، فقد اُعيد بناؤها تحت اشراف صدر الدين الاذرعي الدمشقي الحنفي، وهو قاضي القضاه خلال فتره حكم «السلطان بيبرس»، وقد اُعيد بناؤها مره اخرى خلال عهد برقوق في 1397، وقد بدات المئذنه تميل بزاويه خطره، واعيد بناؤها في عام 1414 بامر من تاج الدين الشاوباكي، والي ومحتسب القاهره، وبنيت مئذنه قايتباي في موقعها اليوم، كجزء من اعاده بناء مدخل المسجد في عام 1432.\n\nباب الجندي\nيقع باب الجندي (باب قايتباي) مباشره بعد فناء مدخل باب المزينين، ويؤدي بدوره الى الباحه الرئيسيه من قاعه الصلاه، وقد بني عام 1495.\n\nمئذنه الغوري\nبنيت المئذنه مزدوجه الرؤوس في عام 1509 في عهد قنصوه الغوري، وتقع على قاعده مربعه، الجزء السفلي منها مثمن، وقد قوست جوانبه الاربعه بعارضات زخرفيه، وفصل عن جوانبيه بعمودين، اما المنطقه الوسطى فصلت عن الجزء السفلي بشرفات مكعبه تدعمه مقرنصات، وهو على شكل مثمن زُيِّن بالقيشاني الازرق، ويتكون الجزء العلوي من عمودين مستطيلين مع الاقواس على شكل حدوه حصان على كل جانب منها توجد مهاوي. ويعلو الجزء العلوي مربع يحمل اثنين من الرؤوس كمثريه الشكل تحمل كل منها هلالاً نحاسيًّا.\n\nالتجديدات العثمانيه والاضافات\nقُدمت عده اضافات وترميمات خلال عهد الخلافه العثمانيه في مصر، وانجز الكثير منها تحت اشراف عبد الرحمن كتخدا الذي ضاعف تقريبا حجم المسجد، واضاف ثلاث بوابات وهي:\n\nباب المزينين، الذي اصبح المدخل الرئيسي للمسجد.\nباب الشربه.\nباب الصعايده.\nواضاف كتخدا عده اروقه، بما في ذلك واحده للطلاب المكفوفين من الازهر، كما اضاف قاعه صلاه اضافيه جنوب القاعه الفاطميه الاصليه، مع محراب اضافي، لمضاعفه مساحه قاعه الصلاه الاجماليه.\n\nباب المزينين\nهو اكبر واهم الابواب الثمانيه للجامع الازهر وهو المدخل الرئيسي للجامع، وسبب تسميته بهذا الاسم ان المزينين كانوا يجلسون امامه من اجل حلق رؤوس المجاورين، وهو نموذج للعماره العثمانيه في القاهره، ويعود الفضل لبنائه الى عبد الرحمن كتخدا عام 1753. كان يحتوي على مئذنه قائمه بذاتها خارج البوابه بناها كتخدا، وقد هدمت المئذنه قبل افتتاح شارع الازهر من قبل توفيق باشا خلال جهود التحديث التي وقعت في جميع انحاء القاهره.\n\nالتخطيط الحالي والهيكل\nالمدخل الرئيسي الحالي الى المسجد هو باب المزينين، وهو احد ابواب الازهر والذي يؤدي الى فناء من الرخام الابيض في الجهه المقابله من قاعه الصلاه الرئيسيه، الى الشمال الشرقي من باب المزينين، نجد الفناء المحيط بواجهه المدرسه الاقبغاويه؛ وفي جنوب غرب نهايه الفناء نجد المدرسه الطيبرسيه،  ومباشره عبر الفناء من مدخل باب المزينين نجد باب الجندي (بوابه قايتباي)، الذي بني عام 1495، ويقف فوق مئذنه قايتباي، ومن خلال هذه البوابه نجد موقع باحه قاعه الصلاه. وقد غير المحراب مؤخرا الى رخام عادي مواجه مع نقوش ذهبيه.\n\nشيخ الازهر\nشيخ الازهر يُسمى كذلك «الامام الاكبر» هو اعلى منصب في هيكل اداره الجامع، وقد كان النظام المتبع ان ينتخب من بين كبار العلماء، وقد انشئ منصب شيخ الجامع الازهر في عهد الحكم العثماني ليتولى رئاسه علمائه، ويشرف على شؤونه الاداريه، ويحافظ على الامن والنظام بالازهر.\nوشيوخ الازهر بالترتيب الزمني هم:\n\nالتكريم\nنظراً للقيمه الاثريه والتاريخيه للجامع الازهر، وكنوع من تسليط الضوء على احد المعالم المصريه العريقه، فقد تم تزيين وجه العمله الورقيه المصريه فئه خمسون قرشاً برسم صوره الجامع الازهر في اكثر من اصدار، بينما يحمل ظهر الورقه الحاليه صوره لتمثال رمسيس الثاني.\n\nمعرض صور\nانظر

      "summary": "الجامع الأزهر هو أهم مساجد مصر على الإطلاق، وأحد المعاقل التاريخية لنشر وتعليم الإسلام كذلك هو واحد من أشهر المساجد الأثرية في مصر والعالم الإسلامي، وجزء من مؤسسة الأزهر الشريف يعود تاريخ بنائه إلى بداية عهد الدولة الفاطمية في مصر، بعدما أتم جوهر الصقلي فتح مصر سنة 969م، وشرع في تأسيس القاهرة قام بإنشاء القصر الكبير وأعده لنزول الخليفة المعز لدين الله، وفي أثناء ذلك بدأ في إنشاء الجامع الأزهر ليصلي فيه الخليفة، وليكون مسجداً جامعاً للمدينة حديثة النشأة أسوة بجامع عمرو في الفسطاط وجامع ابن طولون في القطائع، كذلك أعد وقتها ليكون معهداً تعليمياً لتعليم المذهب الشيعي ونشره، فبدأ في بناؤه في جمادي الأول 359هـ/970م، وأتم بناءه وأقيمت أول جمعة فيه في رمضان سنة 361هـ /972م، وعرف بجامع القاهرة ورغم أن يد الإصلاح والترميم توالت عليه على مر العصور فغيرت كثيراً من معالمه الفاطمية إلا أنه يعد أقدم أثر فاطمي قائم بمصر. وقد اختلف المؤرخون في أصل تسمية هذا الجامع، والراجح أن الفاطميين سموه بالأزهر تيمناً بفاطمة الزهراء ابنة النبي محمد.\nيعتبر المسجد ثاني أقدم جامعة قائمة بشكل مستمر في العالم بعد جامعة القرويين. ورغم أن جامع عمرو بن العاص في الفسطاط سبقه في وظيفة التدريس حيث كانت تعقد فيه حلقات الدرس تطوعاً وتبرعاً، إلا أن الجامع الأزهر يعد الأول في مصر في تأدية دور المدارس والمعاهد النظامية، فكانت دروسه تعطى بتكليف من الدولة ويؤجر عليها العلماء والمدرسين. وألقي أول درس فيه في صفر سنة 365هـ/975م على يد علي بن النعمان القاضي في فقه الشيعة، وفي سنة 378هـ/988م قررت مرتبات لفقهاء الجامع وأعدت داراً لسكناهم بجواره وكانت عدتهم خمسة وثلاثين رجلاً.\nبعد سقوط الدولة الفاطمية أفل نجم الأزهر على يد صلاح الدين الأيوبي الذي كان يهدف من وراء ذلك إلى محاربة المذهب الشيعي ومؤازرة المذهب السني، فأبطلت الخطبة فيه وظلت معطلة مائة عام إلى أن أعيدت في عهد السلطان المملوكي الظاهر بيبرس البندقداري. وفي عهد الدولة المملوكية عاد الأزهر ليؤدي رسالته العلمية ودوره الحيوي، فعين به فقهاء لتدريس المذهب السني والأحاديث النبوية وعنى بتجديده وتوسعته وصيانته فعد ذلك العصر الذهبي للأزهر، كما أظهر الحكام والأعيان في العصور التالية اهتماماً ملحوظاً بترميمه وصيانته وأوقفت عليه أوقافاً كثيرة.\nفي عهد الملك فؤاد الأول صدر القانون رقم 46 لسنة 1930 للأزهر والذي بموجبه أنشأت كليات أصول الدين والشريعة واللغة والعربية لاحقاً سنة 1933، وأصبح للأزهر رسميًا جامعة مستقلة في عام 1961. وقد اعتبرت جامعة الأزهر الأولى في العالم الإسلامي لدراسة المذهب السني والشريعة الإسلامية. ولا يزال الأزهر حتى اليوم منارة لنشر وسطية الإسلام ومؤسسة لها تأثير عميق في المجتمع المصري ورمزاً من رموز مصر الإسلامية.",
