It is situated about 98 kilometres (61 miles) southwest of Djibouti City and 10 km (6 mi) north of the border with Ethiopia. It sprawls on a wide basin surrounded by granitic mountains on all sides. Ali Sabieh's mild climate makes it a popular tourist destination for Djiboutians. The landmark of Ali Sabieh mountain is located near the city.\n\nHistory\nAli Sabieh was a small village when the French created their French Somaliland. According to an old legend, the present-day territory of Ali Sabieh was covered by some trees, wadis, and a well. Nomads used to stop at the well for water on their way to the towns of Zeila or Harar, after signing the treaties in 1894 with the then-ruling Ugaas of Issa Somali, to establish a protectorate in the region referred to as French Somaliland. \nAli Sabieh became an administrative and commercial centre in the 19th century after the construction of the Ethio-Djibouti Railways, the first railway in French Somaliland. The railway reached this location on 14 July 1900. During this time, Ali Sabieh became the town that profited most from it and became a \"boom city,\" attracting most of the trade. In 1904, a report notes that \"when the border post of Ali Sabieh, it has the appearance of a fortress.\" Attached to the circle of \"Gobad-Dikkil\" from its inception in 1931, Ali Sabieh became the chief town of a circle autonomously 1939.\nDuring World War II, Italy's declaration of war on France and Great Britain came on 10 June 1940. The Italians undertook some offensive actions beginning on 18 June. From the Harrar Governorate, troops under General Guglielmo Nasi attacked the fort of Ali-Sabieh, and there was some skirmishing over the Ethio-Djibouti Railways. Between 1 and 10 July, several clashes with the Italians took place at Ali-Sabieh and along the railroad. On 10 July, when the government learned that the armistice was not yet put into effect in French Somaliland, President Philippe Pétain, a collaborationist government at Vichy, sent General Gaëtan Germain as his personal representative to correct the situation. Negotiations at Dewele, Italian East Africa on the local implementation of the armistice were finally completed on 8 August. With the Italian invasion of British Somaliland, the territory was completely surrounded on land by Italian possessions.\nThe Commander-in-Chief, East Africa, William Platt, codenamed the negotiations for the surrender of French Somaliland \"Pentagon\", because there were five sides: himself, the Vichy governor, the Free French, the British minister at Addis Ababa, and the United States. Christian Raimond Dupont surrendered and Colonel Raynal's troops crossed back into French Somaliland on 26 December 1942, completing its liberation. The official handover took place at 10:00 p.m. on 28 December. The first governor appointed under the Free French was André Bayardelle. It was briefly attached to the Circle of Djibouti from 1946 to 1949, then again to that circle of Gobad-Dikkil, 1952 to 1958, and to regain its own administration from 1958, but in 1967, it was transformed into districts.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 1977–1978 Ogaden War, Ali Sabieh, along with Dikhil, accommodated three quarters of the 8,000 Issa Somalis who had fled Ethiopia.\n\nOverview\nAli Sabieh is the capital of the Ali Sabieh Region.
