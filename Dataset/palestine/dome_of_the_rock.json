      "content": "The Dome of the Rock (Arabic: قبة الصخرة, romanized: Qubbat aṣ-Ṣaḵra) is an octagonal Islamic shrine at the center of the Al-Aqsa mosque compound on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is the world's oldest surviving work of Islamic architecture, the earliest archaeologically-attested religious structure to be built by a Muslim ruler and contains the earliest inscriptions proclaiming Islam and the prophet Muhammad.\nIts initial construction was undertaken by the Umayyad Caliphate on the orders of Abd al-Malik during the Second Fitna in 691–692 CE, and it has since been situated on top of the site of the Second Jewish Temple (built in c. 516 BCE to replace the destroyed Solomon's Temple and rebuilt by Herod the Great), which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. The original dome collapsed in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–23.\nIts architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces. Its outside appearance was significantly changed during the Early Ottoman period, when brightly coloured, mainly blue-and-white Iznik-style tiles were applied to the exterior, and again in the modern period, notably with the addition of the gold-plated roof, in 1959–61 and again in 1993. The octagonal plan of the structure may have been influenced by the Byzantine-era Church of the Seat of Mary (also known as Kathisma in Greek and al-Qadismu in Arabic), which was built between 451 and 458 on the road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem.\nThe Foundation Stone (or Noble Rock) that the temple was built over bears great significance in the Abrahamic religions as the place where God created the world as well as the first human, Adam. It is also believed to be the site where Abraham attempted to sacrifice his son, and as the place where God's divine presence is manifested more than in any other place, towards which Jews turn during prayer. The site's great significance for Muslims derives from traditions connecting it to the creation of the world and the belief that the Night Journey of Muhammad began from the rock at the centre of the structure.\nDesignated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, it has been called \"Jerusalem's most recognizable landmark\" along with two nearby Old City structures: the Western Wall and the \"Resurrection Rotunda\" in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Its Islamic inscriptions proved to be a milestone, as afterward they became a common feature in Islamic structures and almost always mention Muhammad. The Dome of the Rock remains a \"unique monument of Islamic culture in almost all respects\", including as a \"work of art and as a cultural and pious document\", according to art historian Oleg Grabar.\n\nArchitecture\nStructure\nThe Dome of the Rock's basic plan is essentially octagonal. It is capped at its center by a dome, approximately 20 m (66 ft) in diameter, mounted on an elevated circular drum standing on 16 supports (4 piers and 12 columns). Surrounding this circle is an octagonal arcade of 24 piers and columns. The inner circular row of drum supports and the octagonal arcade create an inner ambulatory that encircles the holy rock. The outer walls are also octagonal. They each measure approximately 60 m (200 ft) wide and 36 m (118 ft) high. The inner and outer octagon create a second, outer ambulatorium surrounding the inner one. Both the circular drum and the exterior walls contain many windows.\n\nInterior decoration\nThe interior of the dome is lavishly decorated with mosaic, faience and marble, much of which was added several centuries after its completion. The inner colonnade features ablaq light and dark stone voussoirs in its arches. The origins of these marble treatments are controversial, with some scholars theorizing them to be from the original construction, and some saying they were later additions (and differing then as to the dates and identity of the builders).\nIt also contains Qur'anic inscriptions. They vary from today's standard text (mainly changes from the first to the third person) and are mixed with pious inscriptions not in the Quran. The dedicatory inscription in Kufic script placed around the dome contains the date believed to be the year the Dome was first completed, AH 72 (691/2 CE), while the name of the corresponding caliph and builder of the Dome, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, was deleted and replaced by the name of Abbasid caliph Al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) during whose reign renovations took place.\n\nExterior decoration\nThe decoration of the outer walls went through two major phases: the initial Umayyad scheme comprised marble and mosaics, much like the interior walls. 16th-century Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent replaced it with Ottoman tile decoration. This tilework was of many different styles and techniques, including cuerda seca tiles, multi-coloured underglaze tiles, and blue-and-white tilework, resembling the Iznik tiles that were produced for the Ottoman capital. A small number of tiles were actual Iznik productions that were imported to Jerusalem. The original tiles were replaced in the 1960s with faithful copies produced in Italy.\nSurah Ya-Sin (the 'Heart of the Quran') is inscribed across the top of the tile work and was commissioned in the 16th century by Suleiman the Magnificent. Surah 17, Al-Isra', which tells the story of the Isra or Night Journey, is inscribed above this.\n\nHistory\nPre-Islamic background\nThe Dome of the Rock is situated in the center of the Temple Mount, the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Jewish Temple, which had been greatly expanded under Herod the Great in the 1st century BCE. Herod's Temple was destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans, and after the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, a Roman temple to Jupiter Capitolinus was built at the site by Emperor Hadrian.\nJerusalem was ruled by the Byzantine Empire throughout the 4th to 6th centuries. During this time, Christian pilgrimage to Jerusalem began to develop. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built under Constantine in the 320s, but the Temple Mount was left undeveloped after a failed project of restoration of the Jewish Temple under Emperor Julian.\nIn 638 CE, Byzantine Jerusalem was conquered by the Arab armies of Umar ibn al-Khattab, second Caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. Umar was advised by Ka'b al-Ahbar, a Jewish rabbi who converted to Islam, that the site is identical with the site of the former Jewish Temples in Jerusalem. Among the first Muslims, Jerusalem was referred to as Madinat bayt al-Maqdis ('City of the Temple').\n\nUmayyads\nOriginal construction\nThe initial octagonal structure of the Dome of the Rock and its round wooden dome had basically the same shape as it does today. It was built by the order of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705). According to Sibt ibn al-Jawzi (1185–1256), construction started in 685/6, while al-Suyuti (1445–1505) holds that its commencement year was 688. A dedicatory inscription in Kufic script is preserved inside the dome. The date is recorded as AH 72 (691/2 CE), the year most historians believe the construction of the original Dome was completed. An alternative interpretation of the inscription claims that it indicates the year when construction started. In this inscription, the name of \"al-Malik\" was removed and replaced by the name of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833). This alteration of the original inscription was first noted by Melchior de Vogüé in 1864. Some scholars have suggested that the dome was added to an existing building, built either by Muawiyah I (r. 661–680), or indeed a Byzantine building dating to before the Muslim conquest, built under Heraclius (r. 610–641).\nThe Dome of the Rock's architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces. The supervisor and engineer in charge of the project were Raja ibn Haywa, Yazid ibn Salam, and the latter's son Baha. Raja was a Muslim theologian and native of Beisan, and Yazid and Baha were mawali (non-Arab, Muslim converts; clients) of Abd al-Malik from Jerusalem. Abd al-Malik was represented in the supervision of the construction by his son Sa'id al-Khayr. The Caliph employed expert works from across his domain, at the time restricted to Syria and Egypt, who were presumably Christians. Construction cost was reportedly seven times the yearly tax income of Egypt. The historian K. A. C. Creswell noted that those who built the shrine used the measurements of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The diameter of the dome of the shrine is 20.20 m (66.3 ft) and its height 20.48 m (67.2 ft), while the diameter of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is 20.90 m (68.6 ft) and its height 21.05 m (69.1 ft).\n\nMotivations for construction\nNarratives by the medieval sources about Abd al-Malik's motivations in building the Dome of the Rock vary. At the time of its construction, the Caliph was engaged in war with Christian Byzantium and its Syrian Christian allies on the one hand and with the rival caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, who controlled Mecca, the annual destination of Muslim pilgrimage, on the other hand. Thus, one series of explanations was that Abd al-Malik intended for the Dome of the Rock to be a religious monument of victory over the Christians that would distinguish Islam's uniqueness within the common Abrahamic religious setting of Jerusalem, home of the two older Abrahamic faiths, Judaism and Christianity. The historian Shelomo Dov Goitein has argued that the Dome of the Rock was intended to compete with the many fine buildings of worship of other religions: \"The very form of a rotunda, given to the Qubbat as-Sakhra, although it was foreign to Islam, was destined to rival the many Christian domes\" - and more specifically, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, according to others.\nThe other main explanation holds that Abd al-Malik, in the heat of the war with Ibn al-Zubayr, sought to build the structure to divert the focus of the Muslims in his realm from the Ka'aba in Mecca, where Ibn al-Zubayr would publicly condemn the Umayyads during the annual pilgrimage to the sanctuary. Though most modern historians dismiss the latter account as a product of anti-Umayyad propaganda in the traditional Muslim sources and doubt that Abd al-Malik would attempt to alter the sacred Muslim requirement of fulfilling the pilgrimage to the Ka'aba, other historians concede that this cannot be conclusively dismissed.\n\nAbbasids and Fatimids\nThe building was severely damaged by earthquakes in 808 and again in 846. The dome collapsed in an earthquake in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–1023. The mosaics on the drum were repaired in 1027–1028. The earthquake of 1033 resulted in the introduction of wooden beams to enforce the dome.\n\nCrusaders\nFor centuries Christian pilgrims were able to come and experience the Temple Mount, but escalating violence against pilgrims to Jerusalem (Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, who ordered the destruction of the Holy Sepulchre, was an example) resulted in the Crusades. The Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099 and the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church, while the nearby Al-Aqsa main prayer hall or Qibli Mosque first became a royal palace for a while, and then for much of the 12th century the headquarters of the Knights Templar. The Templars, active from c. 1119, identified the Dome of the Rock as the site of the Temple of Solomon. The Templum Domini, as they called the Dome of the Rock, featured on the official seals of the Order's Grand Masters (such as Everard des Barres and Renaud de Vichiers), and soon became the architectural model for round Templar churches across Europe.\n\nAyyubids and Mamluks\nJerusalem was recaptured by Saladin on 2 October 1187, and the Dome of the Rock was reconsecrated as a Muslim shrine. The cross on top of the dome was replaced by a crescent, and a wooden screen was placed around the rock below. Saladin's nephew al-Malik al-Mu'azzam Isa carried out other restorations within the building, and added the porch to the Jami'a Al-Aqsa.\nThe Dome of the Rock was the focus of extensive royal patronage by the sultans during the Mamluk period, which lasted from 1260 until 1516.\n\nOttoman period (1517–1917)\nDuring the Ottoman period, the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520–1566) brought Ottoman dynastic patronage to the city, around the same time that the sultan and his wife, Haseki Hürrem Sultan (Roxelana), were also commissioning works in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Suleiman initiated a major renovation of the Dome of the Rock. The most visible legacy of this work was the covering of the exterior with Ottoman-style tiles, which replaced the old Umayyad mosaics. This was likely part of an effort to impose a visibly Ottoman mark on this major Islamic holy site. Inscriptions on the tiles provide the dates 952 AH (1545–6 CE) and 959 AH (1552 CE), but work continued until the end of Suleiman's reign, if not later. Documents show repairs were still incomplete by the time of Murad III (r. 1574–1595) and the latter can probably be credited with finishing this work, which included repairs to the lead of the dome.\nThe tiles seem to have been fabricated locally rather than at centers like Iznik (famous for its production of Iznik pottery at this time), although there does not appear to have been a sophisticated ceramic production center in the region. Robert Hillenbrand remarks that the workshops that produced the tiles must have been dedicated to this project alone, because there is no evidence that similar tilework was produced for other monuments in Jerusalem during this period. The name of one of the craftsmen is recorded in an inscription as Abdallah of Tabriz. This may indicate that the tiles were commissioned from a workshop of Iranian craftsmen from Tabriz who are thought to have produced many earlier Ottoman tiles.\nThe Dome of the Chain, a free-standing structure next to the Dome of the Rock, was also renovated as part of Suleiman's project, in 1561–2. Also nearby, the Ottomans built the Dome of the Prophet in its current form sometime in the 16th or 17th century.\nFurther restorations to the building are recorded in 1720–1721, 1742,1754, 1780, 1817–1818, and 1853. In another major restoration project undertaken in 1874–1875 during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz, all the tiles on the west and southwest walls of the octagonal part of the building were removed and replaced by copies that had been made in Turkey.\n\nBritish Mandate\nHaj Amin al-Husseini, appointed Grand Mufti by the British in 1917, along with Yaqub al-Ghusayn, implemented the restoration of the Dome of the Rock and the Jami Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem.\nParts of the Dome of the Rock collapsed during the 11 July 1927 earthquake, and the walls were left badly cracked, damaging many of the repairs that had taken place over previous years.\n\nJordanian rule\nIn 1955, an extensive program of renovation was begun by the government of Jordan, with funds supplied by Arab governments and Turkey. The work included replacement of large numbers of tiles dating back to the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, which had become dislodged by heavy rain. In 1965, as part of this restoration, the dome was covered with a durable aluminium bronze alloy made in Italy that replaced the lead exterior. Before 1959, the dome was covered in blackened lead. In the course of substantial restoration carried out from 1959 to 1962, the lead was replaced by aluminum-bronze plates covered with gold leaf.\n\nIsraeli rule\nA few hours after the Israeli flag was hoisted over the Dome of the Rock in 1967 during the Six-Day War, Israelis lowered it on the orders of Moshe Dayan and invested the Muslim waqf (religious trust) with the authority to manage the Temple Mount in order to \"keep the peace\".\nIn 1993, the golden dome covering was refurbished following a donation of US$8.25 million by King Hussein of Jordan, who sold one of his houses in London to fund the 80 kilograms (180 lb) of gold required.\n\nAccessibility\nThe Dome is maintained by the Ministry of Awqaf in Amman, Jordan.\nUntil the mid-20th century, non-Muslims were not permitted in the area. Since 1967, non-Muslims have been permitted limited access; however non-Muslims are not permitted to pray on the Temple Mount, bring prayer books, or wear religious apparel. The Israeli police help enforce this. Israel restricted access for a short time during 2012 of Palestinian residents of the West Bank to the Temple Mount. West Bank Palestinian men had to be over 35 to be eligible for a permit. Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, who hold Israeli residency cards, and Palestinians with Israeli citizenship are permitted unrestricted access.\nSome Orthodox rabbis encourage Jews to visit the site, while most forbid entry to the compound lest there be a violation of Jewish law. Even rabbis who encourage entrance to the Temple Mount prohibit entrance to the actual Dome of the Rock.\n\nReligious significance\nThe location of the Dome of the Rock is believed by many Muslims to be the site mentioned in Sura 17 of the Qur'an, which tells the story of the Isra and Mi'raj, the mythical Night Journey of Muhammad from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Masjid Al-Aqsa (\"the farthest place of prayer\") where he prayed, and then to visit heaven where he leads prayers and rises to heaven to receive instructions from Allah. Although the city of Jerusalem is not mentioned by any of its names in the Qur'an, it is mentioned in hadiths as the place of Muhammad's Night Journey.\nJudging though by the early Muslim sources, this does not seem to have been yet a fully formulated part of the beliefs shared by Muslims during the construction of the Dome in the 8th century, and the inscriptions inside the dome attributing the building to Caliph 'Abd al-Malik in the year 691/2 do not refer at all to the Night Journey, but contain only the Quranic view on the nature of the prophet Isa (Jesus) instead. The inscription is in a mosaic frieze that includes an explicit rejection of the divinity of Christ:\n\n33. \"So peace is upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!\" 34. Such is Jesus, son of Mary. It is a statement of truth, about which they doubt. 35. It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should take himself a child. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it, \"Be\", and it is.\nAccording to Goitein, the inscriptions decorating the interior clearly display a spirit of polemic against Christianity, whilst stressing at the same time the Qur'anic doctrine that Jesus was a true prophet. The formula la sharika lahu ('God has no companion') is repeated five times; the verses from Sura Maryam 19:35–37, which strongly reaffirm Jesus' prophethood to God, are quoted together with the prayer: Allahumma salli ala rasulika wa'abdika 'Isa bin Maryam – \"O Lord, send your blessings to your Prophet and Servant Jesus son of Mary.\" He believes that this shows that rivalry with Christendom, together with the spirit of Muslim mission to the Christians, was at work at the time of construction.\nAt the beginning of the 8th century, Ibn Ishaq codified the earliest Arabic source pertaining to the Jerusalem Rock, as part of his Sirat al-Nabi, a biography of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, introducing the notion that right after his Night Journey from Mecca to Jerusalem (isra'), he set off immediately and specifically from the Rock in his Ascension (mi'raj) to Heaven, where God instructed him in the doctrines of the new religion.\nToday, many Muslims believe the Dome serves for the commemoration of Muhammad's Ascension, in accordance to the views shared by some Islamic scholars, that the Rock is indeed the spot from which Muhammad ascended to Heaven accompanied by the angel Gabriel. Further, Muhammad was taken here by Gabriel to pray with Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.\n\nOther Islamic scholars believe that Muhammad ascended to Heaven from the Masjid Al-Aqsa, of which the Dome of the Rock is a part.\nIn traditional Jewish sources, it is believed to be the place from which the creation of the world began. Moreover, many Jews believe the site to be where Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac. The Foundation Stone and its surroundings which lie at the center of the dome, are considered the holiest site in Judaism. Jews traditionally regard the location of the stone as the holiest spot on Earth, the site of the Holy of Holies of the First and the Second Temple.\nThough Muslims now pray towards the Kaaba at Mecca, they once faced the Temple Mount as the Jews do; Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad led prayers towards Jerusalem until the 16th or 17th month after his migration from Mecca to Medina, when Allah directed him to instead turn towards the Kaaba in Mecca.\nThe Temple Institute wishes to relocate the Dome to another site and replace it with a Third Temple, a vision in line with the New Jerusalem prophecy. Some religious Jews, following rabbinic teaching, believe that the Temple should only be rebuilt in the messianic era, and that it would be presumptuous of people to force God's hand. However, some Evangelical Christians consider rebuilding of the Temple to be a prerequisite to Armageddon and the Second Coming. Jeremy Gimpel, a US-born candidate for The Jewish Home political party in the 2013 Israeli elections, caused a controversy when he was recorded telling a Fellowship Church evangelical group in Florida in 2011 to imagine the incredible experience that would follow were the Dome to be destroyed and the construction of the Third Temple begun. All evangelicals would immediately rush to go to Israel, he opined.\n\nInfluence and depiction\nHomages in art and architecture\nIt was long believed that the Dome of the Rock echoed the architecture of the Temple in Jerusalem, as can be seen in Raphael's The Marriage of the Virgin and in Perugino's Marriage of the Virgin.\nFor the same reason, the Dome of the Rock has inspired the architecture of a number of buildings. These include the 15th-century octagonal Church of St. Giacomo in Italy, the 19th-century octagonal Moorish Revival-style Rumbach Street Synagogue in Budapest, as well as the Mausoleum of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in Istanbul and the New Synagogue in Berlin, Germany.\n\nOn banknotes\nThe Dome of the Rock has been depicted on the obverse and reverse of several Middle Eastern currencies:\n\nGallery\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\nCreswell, K.A.C.

      "summary": "The Dome of the Rock (Arabic: قبة الصخرة, romanized: Qubbat aṣ-Ṣaḵra) is an octagonal Islamic shrine at the center of the Al-Aqsa mosque compound on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is the world's oldest surviving work of Islamic architecture, the earliest archaeologically-attested religious structure to be built by a Muslim ruler and contains the earliest inscriptions proclaiming Islam and the prophet Muhammad.\nIts initial construction was undertaken by the Umayyad Caliphate on the orders of Abd al-Malik during the Second Fitna in 691–692 CE, and it has since been situated on top of the site of the Second Jewish Temple (built in c. 516 BCE to replace the destroyed Solomon's Temple and rebuilt by Herod the Great), which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. The original dome collapsed in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–23.\nIts architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces. Its outside appearance was significantly changed during the Early Ottoman period, when brightly coloured, mainly blue-and-white Iznik-style tiles were applied to the exterior, and again in the modern period, notably with the addition of the gold-plated roof, in 1959–61 and again in 1993. The octagonal plan of the structure may have been influenced by the Byzantine-era Church of the Seat of Mary (also known as Kathisma in Greek and al-Qadismu in Arabic), which was built between 451 and 458 on the road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem.\nThe Foundation Stone (or Noble Rock) that the temple was built over bears great significance in the Abrahamic religions as the place where God created the world as well as the first human, Adam. It is also believed to be the site where Abraham attempted to sacrifice his son, and as the place where God's divine presence is manifested more than in any other place, towards which Jews turn during prayer. The site's great significance for Muslims derives from traditions connecting it to the creation of the world and the belief that the Night Journey of Muhammad began from the rock at the centre of the structure.\nDesignated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, it has been called \"Jerusalem's most recognizable landmark\" along with two nearby Old City structures: the Western Wall and the \"Resurrection Rotunda\" in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Its Islamic inscriptions proved to be a milestone, as afterward they became a common feature in Islamic structures and almost always mention Muhammad. The Dome of the Rock remains a \"unique monument of Islamic culture in almost all respects\", including as a \"work of art and as a cultural and pious document\", according to art historian Oleg Grabar.",

      "content": "مصلى قبه الصخره احد اجزاء المسجد الاقصى «فالمسجد الاقصى هو كل ما داخل سور الاقصى»، وهو جزء من احد اهم المساجد الاسلاميه في مدينه القدس وفلسطين والعالم الاسلامي، ومن اجمل الابنيه في العالم، اذ تُعتبر قبّته من اهم وابرز المعالم المعماريه الاسلاميه، كما ويُعتبر اقدم بناء اسلامي بقي مُحافظا على شكله وزخرفته. بنى هذا المسجد والقبّه الخليفه عبد الملك بن مروان، حيث بدا في بنائها عام 66هـ الموافق 685م، وانتهى منها عام 72هـ الموافق 691م، واشرف على بنائها المهندسان رجاء بن حيوه الكندي، وهو من التابعين المعروفين، ويزيد بن سلام مولى عبد الملك بن مروان. وقبّه الصخره عباره عن بناء مثمن الاضلاع له اربعه ابواب، وفي داخله تثمينه اخرى تقوم على دعامات واعمده اسطوانيه، في داخلها دائره تتوسطها «الصخره المُشرفه» التي عرج منها النبي محمد الى السماء في رحله الاسراء والمعراج،\nوترتفع هذه الصخره نحو 1,5 متراً عن ارضيه البناء، وهي غير منتظمه الشكل، ويتراوح قطرها بين 13 و 18 متراً، وتعلو الصخره في الوسط قبّه دائريه قطرها حوالي 20 متراً، مطليه من الخارج بالواح الذهب، ارتفاعها 35 متراً، يعلوها هلال بارتفاع خمسه امتار.\nويذكر بعض العلماء ان الكنائس التي بناها فرسان الهيكل فيما بعد، تاثرت باسلوب العماره الاسلاميه وبنمط قبه الصخره، ويظهر ذلك جليًا في قلعه كاستل دل مونتي الايطاليه.\nتعتبر قبه الصخره المشرفه احدى اهم المعالم الاسلاميه في العالم، فاضافه الى مكانتها وقدسيتها الدينيه، فهي اقدم نموذج في العماره الاسلاميه، ولما تحمله من روعه فنيه وجماليه تطوي بين زخارفها بصمات الحضاره الاسلاميه على مر فتراتها المتتابعه، حيث جلبت انتباه واهتمام الباحثين والزائرين من كل البقاع، لما امتازت به من تناسق وانسجام عناصرها المعماريه والزخرفيه، حتى اعتبرت ايه في الهندسه المعماريه.\nوقد اهتم المسلمون برعايه وعنايه قبه الصخره المشرفه، على مر الفترات الاسلاميه المتعاقبه، خاصه بعد كل خراب له جراء التاثيرات الطبيعيه، من هزات ارضيه او عواصف او امطار او حرائق، فلم يتاخر اي خليفه او سلطان في ترميمها والحفاظ عليها.\n\nتاريخ\nبنى الخليفه الاموي عبد الملك بن مروان المصلى عام 72هـ لاستقطاب المسلمين الى هذه البقعه المقدسه، بعد نقل عاصمه الخلافه من المدينه المنوره الى دمشق واقامه الامويين في بلاد الشام. ويقع المصلى وسط هضبه صخريه واسعه تسمى الحرم الشريف ويقع على امتداد محوره الجامع القبلي.\nتعد قبه الصخره من اهم معالم المسجد الاقصى المبارك، وقد شرع في انشائه عبد الملك بن مروان الخليفه الاموي الخامس، سنه 68هـ\\688م، حول الصخره المشرفه الواقعه على صحن مرتفع وسط ساحه الحرم الشريف، وانتهى بناؤها عام 72هـ\\691م.\nوقد اقام عبد الملك فوقها بناء مستديرًا، مكونًا من قبه خشبيه مرتكزه على رقبه مستديره الشكل، محاطه بست عشره نافذه. وهذه الرقبه مستنده على رواق مستدير، محموله على اربعه اركان من الرخام الابيض المشجر، واثني عشر عمودًا موزعه، بحيث يعقب كل ركن ثلاثه اعمده. ويتكون باقي البناء الذي في ظاهر الرواق الداخلي المستدير من مطافين يحوطان به. وهما منفصلان، احدهما عن الاخر، برواق وسطي مثمن الشكل، محمول على ثمانيه اركان، مؤزره بالرخام المشجر والملون البديع، وسته عشر عمودًا موزعه بحيث يعقب كل ركن عمودان. ويربط الاركان والعمد التي بينها بساطل وهو رابط خشبي ملبس بالنحاس الاصفر المذهب المنقوش. وتعلو البساطلَ قناطرُ كلها مزينه بالفص المذهب البديع المزين بانواع التشجير والتنميق. وقد نص على هذه القناطر سقف مائل من الخشب، دهن باطنه باشكال هندسيه ظريفه، وصفح من الظاهر بانواع الرصاص. ويشغل باقي المساحه مطاق خارجي يقع بين الرواق الوسطي وجدران البناء الخارجيه التي تتخذ شكلًا مثمنًا، ولكل ضلع من اضلاعه المقابله للجهات الاربع باب. وعلى بعد بضعه امتار خارج الباب الشرقي تقوم فيه السلسله. وهي بناء جميل كثير الشبه بقبه الصخره مما جعل بعض الدارسين يعتقد انه بني كاُنْموذَجٍ لها.\nوجدير بالذكر، ان جميع الدراسات والاختبارات الاثريه الكثيره التي اجراها علماء مختصون على البناء، خلال عمليات الصيانه والترميم على مدى الازمان، اثبتت بما لا يدع مجالًا لاي شك، ان قبه الصخره، بكامل اساساتها وجدرانها الخارجيه، هي من انشاء عبد الملك بن مروان، وانها بناء متجانس الاجزاء، لا يضم بقايا اي بناء قديم كما توهم بعضهم.\n\nالتسميه\nسُميَّ مسجد قبه الصخره بهذا الاسم نسبهً الى الصخره المُشرفه التي عرج منها النبي محمد في رحله الاسراء والمعراج. ان قبه الصخره اثر هام في تاريخ العماره الاسلاميه مرتبط بكل مسلم وبعقيدته في الاسراء والمعراج، وهي في العماره الاسلاميه اقدم اثر باق يشهد على نشاه فن العماره الاسلاميه، وعلى جمال زخرفه هذا الفن الجديد، وقبه الصخره اثر يشهد لبانيه خليفه المسلمين الاموي عبد الملك بن مروان بجهده ويوضع لبنه اولى في صرح العماره الاسلاميه.\n\nالوصف\nهو بناء من الحجر على تخطيط مثمن طول ضلعه نحو 12,5 متراً، وداخل المثمن الخارجي مثمن اخر داخلي، وفي كل ضلع من اضلاعه ثلاثه عقود محموله على عمود وثمانيه اكتاف، وداخل المثمن الثاني دائره من 12 عمودا واربعه اكتاف، وفوق الدائره قبه قطرها 20,44 متراً، وارتفاع القبه الحالي يبلغ 35,30 متراً عن مستوى التربه، مرفوعه على رقبه اسطوانه فتحت بها 161 نافذه، وهي من الخشب تغطيها من الداخل طبقه من الجبص ومن الخارج طبقه من الرصاص، وللمسجد اربعه ابواب متعامده.\nاما القبب الخارجيه والداخليه فهي منظمه على هيكل مركزي، هيكل القبه الخارجيه مشبوك على اطار الاسطوانه الخارجيه، هذا الاطار مصنوع من جسور خشبيه موصوله مع بعضها لتشكل سلسله دائريه مستمره، فوق هذه الجسور توجد شبكه خشبيه يوضع عليها طبقه الغطاء الخارجيه.\nوتقع الصخره المشرفه في مركز هذا المصلى، ويعتقد العامه ان هذه الصخره معلقه بين السماء والارض وهذا اعتقاد خاطئ. ويوجد اسفل الصخره كهف به محراب قديم يطلق عليه مصلى الانبياء، ويحيط بالصخره حاجز من الخشب المعشق من تجديدات السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون عام 725هـ، وتحيط بمنطقه الصخره اربع دعامات من الحجر المغلف ببلاطات الرخام، بينها 12 عموداً من الرخام، تحمل 16 عقداً تشكل في اعلاها رقبه اسطوانيه، تقوم عليها القبه.\n\nالصخره\nهي عباره عن قطعه ضخمه من الصخر، تقع تحت القبه في وسط المصلى، طولها من الشمال الى الجنوب حوالي 18 متراً، وعرضها من الشرق الى الغرب حوالي اربعه عشر متراً، واعلى نقطه فيها مرتفعه عن الارضيه نحو متر ونصف، وحولها حاجز من الخشب المنقوش والمدهون، وحول هذا الحاجز مصلى للنساء وله اربعه ابواب، يفصل بينه وبين مصلى الرجال حاجز من الحديد المشبك.\n\nالمغاره\nتقع تحت الصخره مغاره يطلق عليها اسم مغاره الارواح، وينزل اليها من الناحيه الجنوبيه باحد عشر درجه. على شكل قريب من المربع، طول كل ضلع منه حوالي اربعه امتار ونصف. ولها سقف ارتفاعه ثلاثه امتار، به ثغره اتساعها متر واحد وعند الباب قنطره مقصوره بالرخام على عمودين.\n\nالزخرفه\nغطت معظم اروقه وجدران المصلى من الداخل بالفسيفساء وهي تظهر الفن الاسلامي في الزخرفه كي تشكل وحده فنيه منسجمه في التكوين ومتحده في الاسلوب، حيث انّ حجاره الفسيفساء كانت مصنوعه محلياً. اجمل ما في الزخرفه الايات القرانيه في اعلى اقواس المضلع المثمن الاوسط تعتبر اقدم ما كتب من الخط العربي الجميل، اطلق عليه اسم الخط الجليل. ومجموعه الالواح البرونزيه المذهبه التي تغطي بعضها اجزاء من الابواب الاربعه او الافاريز الواصله بين تيجان اعمده ارواق هي اجزاء فريده في العالم لاصالتها ولجمالها وغناها الزخرفي، وتسيطر عليها اوراق العنب والعناقيد المعالجه بمهاره متجدده.\nوقد جاء الاستغناء عن الصور الممثله للانسان والحيوان وفقًا لاحكام الديانه الاسلاميه. واستعيض عنها بالاشكال الطبيعيه والرسوم المركبه والتقليديه، مما اعطى المكان رونقًا يمتاز عن غيره بما يبعث في النفس من الشعور بالهدوء والطمانينه والتامل العميق. والزخرفه بمجموعها مكونه من اشكال متباينه مرنه التكييف، ولا شك ان الفنان الصانع لها كان امينًا في صنعه على المبادئ الاساسيه لاساليب الزخرفه التي كثيرًا ما اهملت، وهي ان تاتي الزينه والزخرفه متنافسين مع المكان الذي تجملانه. وهندسه البناء الداخليه هي التي تطلبت ان تكون الزخرفه على ما جاءت عليه.\nوصفوه القول ان قبه الصخره في هندستها وشكلها وزخرفتها كانت ولا تزال من اجمل واروع المباني التي اتحف بها العالم. وقلما يوجد في مباني العالم ما يفوقها، او يضارعها بهاء وروعه وجمالًا. فزياده على زخرفه سقوفها المذهبه وجدرانها الرخاميه ونوافذها الزجاجيه تفتن العين بالفسيفساء. وجمال تاليفها، والوانها التي جاءت كلها على احسن تناسق وانسجام، وبالاشكال المختلفه التي استعملت، والاساليب، والالوان، ودقه الصنع التي بلغت الحد الاعلى من الكمال. كل هذا جعل من قبه الصخره اثرًا فريدًا في تاريخ الفن.\nقبه الصخره المشرفه بين الحقائق والزيف\nالصخره المشرفه هي صخره طبيعيه غير منتظمه الشكل تقع في اعلى نقطه من المسجد الاقصى المبارك في موقع قلب المسجد بالضبط، وهي صخره طبيعيه تتراوح ابعادها بين حوالي 13 مترًا و18 مترًا، ويبلغ ارتفاعها حوالي المترين تقريبًا، وقد دارت حولها القصص الخياليه غير الصحيحه بشكل كبير، كمن قال انها طائره في الهواء، ومن قال انها طارت خلف النبي ، ومن قال ان لها نورًا، وغير ذلك.\nوالحقيقه انها صخره عاديه ليس فيها اي ميزه الا انها كانت قبله انبياء بني اسرائيل قبل النبي ، وقيل ان النبي عرج من فوقها للسماء ليله الاسراء والمعراج، وفيها مغاره صغيره تسمى مغاره الارواح، وهي كذلك تجويف طبيعي وليس فيه اي ميزه خارقه للعاده. وقد بنيت قبه الصخره المشرفه فوق الصخره، وهي ظاهره للعيان الى اليوم.\nوحيكت عده قصص شعبيه خياليه زائفه حول الصخره المشرفه، ذكرها كثير من العلماء، وجمعها الاستاذ عيسى القدومي في كتابه (المسجد الاقصى: الحقيقه والتاريخ)، فمما ذكر القدومي انها اخبار مكذوبه: ان الصخره من صخور الجنه، وانها سيده الصخور، وهي معلقه من كل الجهات، كما ان مياه الارض كلها تخرج من تحت هذه الصخره، وتتحول الى مرجانه بيضاء.\nونشر عنها غيرها من اكاذيب مثل ان عليها موضع قدم رسول الله محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم، وعليها اثر اصابع الملائكه، وان الماء الذي يخرج من اصل الصخره نهر من انهار الجنه، وان المياه العذبه والرياح واللواقح من تحت صخره ببيت المقدس.\nقيل ايضًا انها عرش الله الادنى، ومن تحتها بسطت الارض، وانها وسط الدنيا واوسط الارض كلها، واخيرًا ان لها مكانه الحجر الاسود في الكعبه.\nواكد الدكتور عبد الله معروف في دراسته لمعالم المسجد الاقصى ان العلماء انكروا هذا التعلق بالصخره، وبينوا انها صخره طبيعيه وجزء من المسجد الاقصى، وليس لها ايه ميزه خاصه، واكد ان تنبيه الناس الى حقيقه صخره بيت المقدس، لا يقلل من فضائل المسجد الاقصى وبيت المقدس بالبركه والفضيله، وثبت عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم في الكتب الصحاح والسنن، الكثير من الاحاديث التي نصت على ما حباه الله تعالى من الخير والبركه، وبينت الخصائص التي تميز بها المسجد الاقصى وارضه لما لها من مكانه عظيمه ومنزله رفيعه في الشرع الاسلامي. فبركه المسجد الاقصى ثابته بالكتاب والسنه، ولنا غنى في الصحيح منها عن الموضوع والمكذوب.\nوخلاصه الامر ان اغلب ما قيل عن الصخره من اخبار خياليه اصله من الاسرائيليات، وليس له اصل في المصادر الاسلاميه الاساسيه سواء القران الكريم او الصحيح من حديث النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم. وما التركيز على هذا الامر الا بسبب انتشار كبير لبعض هذه الاخبار الزائفه بين المسلمين هذه الايام، وخاصه مساله تعليق الصخره في الهواء!\n\nمعرض الصور\nوصلات خارجيه\nفيديو لداخل قبه الصخره على يوتيوب.\nنموذج ثلاثي الابعاد لقبه الصخره.\n\nانظر ايضًا\nالمسجد الاقصى.\nالاوقاف في
