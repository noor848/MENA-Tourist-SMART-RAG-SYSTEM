      "content": "Ramallah (UK:  rə-MAL-ə, US:  rə-MAH-lə; Arabic: رام الله, romanized: Rām Allāh; IPA: [raːm alˤ.lˤaːh] ; lit. 'God's Height') is a city in the central West Bank, Palestine. It serves as the administrative capital of Palestine, as well as capital of the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate. The city is situated on the Judaean Mountains, 10 km (6 miles) north of Jerusalem, at an average elevation of 872 meters (2,861 ft) above sea level, adjacent to al-Bireh.\nRamallah has buildings containing masonry from the period of Herod the Great, but no complete building predates the Crusades of the 11th century. The modern city was founded during the 16th century by the Hadadeens, an Arab Christian clan descended from Ghassanids. In 1517, the city was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, and in 1920, it became part of British Mandatory Palestine after it was captured by the United Kingdom during World War I. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Ramallah, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Ramallah was later captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Since the 1995 Oslo Accords, Ramallah has been governed by the Palestinian Authority, as part of Area A in the West Bank.\nRamallah has emerged as a key political, cultural, and economic center in recent years. It houses various Palestinian governmental bodies, including the Mukataa, the official residence of the president of the Palestinian National Authority, the Palestinian Legislative Council, and the headquarters of the Palestinian Security Services. It is also home to several museums and cultural centers, and has a notable nightlife scene. Historically, the city was a predominantly Christian town, however the population of Muslims has increased to constitute a majority of Ramallah's 38,998 residents by 2017, while Christians make up a significant minority.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nRamallah was founded in the 16th century by the Hadadeens, an Arab Christian clan. The city boasts archaeological remnants from earlier epochs. Ancient rock-cut tombs have been found near Ramallah. Located just south of the built-up area is Tell en-Nasbeh, an archeological site where biblical Mizpah in Benjamin is likely to have been located.\nSeveral Ramallah buildings incorporate masonry dating back to the reign of Herod the Great (37–4 BCE). Potsherds from the Crusader/Ayyubid and early Ottoman period have also been found there. Ramallah has been identified with the Crusader place called Ramalie. Remains of a building with an arched doorway from the Crusader era, called al-Burj, have been identified, but the original use of the building is undetermined.\n\nOttoman period\nThe area of Ramallah was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine. Modern Ramallah was founded in the mid-1500s by the Haddadins (also: Haddadeen), a clan of brothers descended from Ghassanid Christians. The Haddadins (ancestors of the present-day Jadallah family, among others), and their leader Rashid el-Haddadin, arrived from east of the Jordan River from the areas of Karak and Shoubak. The Haddadin migration is attributed to fighting and unrest among clans in that area.\nHaddadin was attracted to the mountainous site of Ramallah because it was similar to the mountainous areas he came from. In addition, the heavily forested area could supply him with plenty of fuel for his forges. In 1596, Ramallah was listed in the tax registers as being in the nahiya of Quds (Jerusalem), part of the Liwa of Quds. It had a population of 71 Christian households and 9 Muslim households. It paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, olives, vines or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 9,400 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf.\nIn 1838, American biblical scholar Edward Robinson visited the area, noting that the inhabitants were Christian \"of the Greek rite\". There were 200 taxable men, which gives an estimated total population of 800–900 people. The village \"belonged\" to the Haram al-Sharif, Jerusalem, to which it paid an annual tax of 350 Mids of grain. In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Ramallah as\n\nA large Christian village, of well-built stone houses, standing on a high ridge, with a view on the west extending to the sea. It stands amongst gardens and olive-yards, and has three springs to the south and one on the west; on the north there are three more, within a mile from the village. On the east there is a well. There are rock-cut tombs to the north-east with well-cut entrances, but completely blocked with rubbish. In the village is a Greek church, and on the east a Latin convent and a Protestant schoolhouse, all modern buildings. The village lands are Wakuf, or ecclesiastical property, belonging to the Haram of Jerusalem. About a quarter of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics, the rest Orthodox Greeks.\n\nBritish Mandate\nDuring World War I, the British Army captured and occupied Ramallah in December 1917. The city remained occupied until the designation of the Palestine Mandate in 1920, resulting in Ramallah falling under British Mandatory control until 1948. In the 1920s, the economy of Ramallah started to improve, resulting in the local Arab upper class (consisting primarily of landowners and merchants) ordering the construction of several multi-storied villas, many of which still stand today. In 1939, the Jerusalem Electric Company introduced electricity to Ramallah, and a majority of the city's homes became wired shortly thereafter. On the same year, the British Mandatory authorities inaugurated the state-owned Palestine Broadcasting Service in Ramallah, with BBC members training local radio staff to deliver daily broadcasts in Arabic, Hebrew, and English. The station was later renamed Jerusalem Calling.\nThe city became a center of insurgent activity when the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine broke out. The rebels subsequently established a court near Ramallah, in order to provide legal alternatives to the courts of the British Mandate. One British schoolteacher noted that the Ramallah court judge began to produce \"news sheets on typewriters and duplicators, aimed at publicizing the alternative rebel regime.\"\n\nJordanian and Israeli occupation\nFollowing the creation of the State of Israel and the ensuing conflict, Jordan seized part of the territory, which they named the West Bank, which included Ramallah. Jordan annexed the West Bank, applying its national law to the conquered territory. The West Bank was relatively peaceful during the years of Jordanian occupation between 1948 and 1967, with its residents enjoying freedom of movement between the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. However, many Palestinians were arrested and jailed for being members of \"illegal political parties\", which included the Palestine Communist Party, and other socialist and pro-independence groups. The city's population had doubled by 1953, but the economy and infrastructure could not accommodate the influx of poor villagers. Natives of Ramallah began to emigrate, primarily to the United States. About one fourth of Ramallah's 6,000 natives had left by 1956, with Arabs from the surrounding towns and villages (particularly Hebron) buying the homes and land the émigrés left behind.\n\nDuring the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel captured Ramallah from Jordan, imposing a military closure and conducting a census a few weeks later. Every person registered in the census was given an Israeli identity card which allowed the bearer to continue to reside there. Those who were abroad during the census lost their residency rights. Because of Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, for the first time in 19 years, residents of Ramallah could freely visit the Gaza Strip, as well as Israel, and engage in commerce there.\nUnlike the Jordanians, Israel did not offer citizenship to the residents. Ramallah residents were issued permits to work in Israel, but did not gain the rights associated with Israeli citizenship. The city remained under Israeli military rule for more than four decades. The Israeli Civil Administration (CA), established in 1981, was in charge of civilian and day-to-day services such as issuing permission to travel, build, export or import, and host relatives from abroad. The CA reprinted Jordanian textbooks for distribution in schools but did not update them. The CA was in charge of tax collection and land expropriation, which sometimes included Israeli seizure of olive groves that Arab villagers had tended for generations.\nAccording to the Israeli Human Rights activists, the development of Jewish settlements in the Ramallah area, such as Beit El and Psagot, prevented the expansion of the city and cut it off from the surrounding Arab villages. As resistance increased, Ramallah residents who were members of the Palestine Liberation Organization were jailed or deported to neighboring countries. The popular uprising known as the First Intifada erupted in December 1987, protesting against the continued Israeli occupation.\nRamallah residents were among the early joiners of the First Intifada. The Intifada Unified Leadership, an umbrella organization of various Palestinian factions, distributed weekly bulletins on the streets of Ramallah with a schedule of the daily protests, strikes and action against Israeli patrols in the city. At the demonstrations, tires were burned in the street, and the crowds threw stones and Molotov cocktails. The IDF responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. Schools in Ramallah were forcibly shut down, and opened gradually for a few hours a day. The Israelis conducted house arrests, imposing curfews that restricted travel and exports in what Palestinians regarded as collective punishment. In response to the closure of schools, residents organized home schooling sessions to help students make up missed material; this became one of the few symbols of civil disobedience. Following the Oslo Accords, the Israeli army abandoned the Mukataa in December 1995 and withdrew to the city outskirts. The newly established Palestinian Authority assumed civilian and security responsibility for the city, which was designated \"Area A\" under the accords.\n\nPalestinian Authority control\nThe years between 1993 and 2000 (known locally as the \"Oslo Years\") brought relative prosperity to Ramallah. Ramallah and its immediate environs were classified as Area A in the Oslo Accords, under full civil and security control of the Palestinian Authority (PA) administration in September 1995. Many expatriates returned to establish businesses there, and the atmosphere was one of optimism. In 2000, unemployment began to rise and the economy of Ramallah declined. The Israel Defense Forces remained in control of the territories and its government did not restore the freedom of movement enjoyed by Ramallah residents prior to the first Intifada. Travel to Jerusalem required special permits. The number and size of Israeli settlements around Ramallah increased dramatically. A network of bypass roads for use of Israeli citizens only was built around Ramallah, and Israel expropriated land for settlements. Many official documents previously handled by the Israeli Civil Administration were now handled by the Palestinian Authority but still required Israeli approval. A Palestinian passport issued to Ramallah residents was not valid unless the serial number was registered with the Israeli authorities, who controlled border crossings.The failure of the Camp David summit in July 2000 led to the outbreak of the Second Intifada (al-Aqsa Intifada) in September 2000. Young Ramallah residents demonstrated daily against the Israeli army, with marches to the Israeli checkpoints at the outskirts of the city. Over time, the marches were replaced by sporadic use of live ammunition against Israeli soldiers; and various attacks targeting Jewish settlers, particularly on the Israeli-only bypass roads. Army checkpoints were established to restrict movement in and out of Ramallah. On October 12, 2000, two Israeli army reservists, Vadim Norzhich and Yosef Avrahami were lynched in Ramallah. They had taken a wrong turn, and were set upon by a mob, enraged in particular by the Muhammad al-Durrah incident in Gaza. A frenzied crowd killed the two IDF reservists, mutilated their bodies, and dragged them through the streets. Later that afternoon, the Israeli army carried out an air strike on Ramallah, demolishing the police station. Israel later succeeded in capturing and prosecuting some of those involved in the deaths of the reservists.The IDF has occasionally operated inside Ramallah, in breach of the 1995 Oslo Accords. The first and largest incursion was the 2002 Operation Defensive Shield, with a more recent intervention coming in March 2017 while attempting to arrest a suspected terrorist. In 2002, the army imposed curfews, electricity cuts, school closures and disruptions of commercial life. Many Ramallah institutions, including government ministries, were vandalized, and equipment was destroyed or stolen. The IDF took over local Ramallah television stations, and social and economic conditions deteriorated. Many expatriates left, as did many other Palestinians who complained that the living conditions had become intolerable. Construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier has added to Ramallah's isolation. Yasser Arafat established his West Bank headquarters, the Mukataa, in Ramallah. Although considered an interim solution, Ramallah became the de facto capital of the Palestinian Authority, now officially known as the State of Palestine.  It hosts almost all governmental headquarters.  In December 2001, Arafat held meetings at the Mukataa, but lived with his wife and daughter in Gaza City. After suicide bombings in Haifa, Arafat was confined to the Ramallah compound. In 2002, the compound was partly demolished by the Israeli Defense Forces and Arafat's building was cut off from the rest of the compound.\nOn November 11, 2004, Arafat died at the Percy training hospital of the Armies near Paris. He was buried in the courtyard of the Mukataa on November 12, 2004. The site still serves as the Ramallah headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, as well the official West Bank office of Mahmoud Abbas. Throughout 2005, while the Disengagement Plan was underway, some US government officials suggested to the Palestinian leadership to move the provisional capital back to Gaza, where it had been when the Palestinian Authority was first established in 1994. President Abbas, however, refrained from doing so, arguing that at this point, it was important to keep the administrative center in the West Bank in order to remind the international community that the West Bank was still awaiting a territorial solution.\nIn December 2005, local elections were held in Ramallah in which candidates from three different factions competed for a four-year term on the fifteen-seat municipal council. The council elected Janet Mikhail as mayor, the first woman to hold the post.\nMunir Hamdan, a member of Fatah and a Ramallah businessman, discussed the concentration of government offices with a journalist. He said, \"The president and prime minister have their offices here. So do the parliament and all the government ministries\", representing a \"collusion\" between the Palestinian Authority and Israel to turn Ramallah into the political as well as the financial capital of the Palestinians. He is particularly worried by the construction of a large new governmental complex by the PA. Hatem Abdel Kader, a Jerusalem resident, Fatah legislator and former Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, complained that \"If they are building a new government compound here, that means they have no plans to be based in Jerusalem... Unfortunately, the Palestinian government of Salam Fayyad has abandoned Jerusalem in favor of Ramallah.\" In November 2011, King Abdullah II of Jordan visited Ramallah for the first time since 2000.\n\nGeography and climate\nThis area enjoys a Mediterranean climate of a dry summer and mild, rainy winter with occasional snowfall. The recorded average of Ramallah's rainfall is about 615 mm (24 in) and minimum rainfall is 307 mm (12 in) and maximum rainfall is 1,591 mm (63 in).\nThe Köppen climate classification places Ramallah in the Csa category. Climates of this class generally occur on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of 30° and 45°. These climates are in the polar front region in winter, and thus have moderate temperatures and changeable, rainy weather. Summers are hot and dry, due to the domination of the subtropical high pressure systems, except in the immediate coastal areas, where summers are milder due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents that may bring fog but prevent rain.\n\nEconomy\nRamallah is chief financial and commercial center for the Palestinian Authority, home to the country's numerous financial institutions. Currently Ramallah is seat of power of the Palestinian Authority, whose most of the offices are located within the city. The city serves as the headquarters for most international NGOs and embassies. Hundreds of millions of dollars in aid flowing into the city have boosted Ramallah's economy greatly since the end of the Second Intifada. Ramallah's buoyant economy continues to draw Palestinians from other West Bank towns where jobs are fewer. The built-up area has grown fivefold since 2002.\nConstruction boom is one of the most obvious signs of West Bank economic growth, estimated at an annual rate of 8 percent. This has been attributed to relative stability and Western donor support to the Palestinian Authority. The PIF have begun work on a $400 million commercial center comprising 13 towers which will be some of the tallest in Ramallah. The Ersal Commercial Center has drawn investment from a Saudi Arabian firm, The Land Holding, which has a 10% stake. It is not the only Gulf Arab firm investing in Ramallah and its outskirts. The Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company has a stake in Rawabi, a completely new town being constructed in the hills outside Ramallah at a cost of $1 billion.\nRamallah has highest concentration of high-tech companies. ASAL technologies, an information technology company in Ramallah, has 120 employees and is looking forward to \"exponential growth\". In collaboration with the Republic of India, a new tech park named, the India Palestine Techno Park is located in Birzeit. Apple Inc operates a research & development center in Rawabi with ASAL Technologies. A large number multinational companies operates facilities in Ramallah, which outsource Palestinians.\nBy 2010, Ramallah had become the leading center of economic and political activity in the territories under the control of the Palestinian Authority. During a building boom in the early years of the 21st century, apartment buildings and \"five-star\" hotels were erected, particularly in the Al-Masyoun neighborhood. In 2010, \"more than one hundred\" Palestinian businesses were reported to have moved to Ramallah from East Jerusalem, because \"Here they pay less taxes and have more customers.\" One local boasted to a journalist that \"Ramallah is becoming the de facto capital of Palestine.\" This boast was seconded by The New York Times which, in 2010, called Ramallah the \"de facto capital of the West Bank. According to Sani Meo, the publisher of This Week in Palestine, \"Capital or no capital, Ramallah has done well and Palestine is proud of its achievements.\" Some Palestinians allege that Ramallah's prosperity is part of an Israeli \"conspiracy\" to make Ramallah the capital of a Palestinian state, instead of Jerusalem.\n\nDemographics\nAn Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that Ramallah had 249 houses and a population of 635, though the population count included men only. The village was described as being in the Bire area, \"north of Mikhmas, on a rocky hill.\" In 1896, the population of Ramallah was estimated to be about 2,061 persons.\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Ramallah had a population of 3,104 (2,972 Christians, 125 Muslims, and seven Jews), the Christians consisting of 2,162 Orthodox, 1 Syriac Orthodox (Jacobite), 332 Roman Catholics, 144 Greek Catholic (Melkite Catholic), 211 Church of England, and 122 \"other\". The population increased at the time of the 1931 census to 4,286 (3,766 Christians, 519 Muslims and one Jew) in a total of 1,014 houses. In the 1938 village statistics, the population is listed as 4,900. In the 1945 statistics, the population stood at 5,080, with Christians forming the majority of the population (4,440 Christians and 640 Muslims).\nHowever, the demographic makeup of the town changed drastically under Jordanian occupation, when considerable emigration of Christians took place. This left slightly more than half of the city's 12,134 inhabitants Christian by 1967, and the remainder Muslim.\nRamallah expatriates created one of the largest Arab communities in the United States, settling mainly in Washington, New York, Florida, California, Texas, and especially in Michigan. Many worked in the auto industry. In 1959, the American Federation of Ramallah, Palestine (AFRP) was established in Detroit. The AFRP has several branches in the United States, and holds an annual convention every summer attended by a sizable number of former Ramallah residents and their offspring.\nRamallah's population drastically decreased in the late 20th century from 24,722 inhabitants in 1987 to 17,851 in 1997. In the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) census in 1997, Palestinian refugees accounted for 60.3% of the population, which was 17,851. There were 8,622 males and 9,229 females. People younger than 20 years of age made up 45.9% of the population, while those aged between 20 and 64 were 45.4%, and residents aged over 64 constituted 4.7%.\nOnly in 2005 did the population reach more than 24,000. In a PCBS projection in 2006, Ramallah had a population of 25,467 inhabitants. In the 2007 PCBS census, there were 27,460 people living in the city. Sources vary about the current Christian population in the city, ranging around 25%.\n\nHealth\nIn the aftermath of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt, the Ramallah Hospital Foundation was established and registered as a tax exempt organization in New York in 1944. It bought large pieces of land in the south-eastern fringes of the city dedicated for the future hospital. In 1963, a hospital was opened.\n\nReligion\nThe Jamal Abdel Nasser Mosque is one of the city's largest mosques. The Orthodox Church of Ramallah, an Orthodox Christian convent, Melkite Catholic Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church, Arab Episcopal (Anglican) Church, Ramallah Local Church (Evangelical\\Born Again) and Ramallah Baptist Church all operate schools in the city.\n\nChristian presence\nRamallah grew dramatically throughout the 17th and 18th centuries as an agricultural village, attracting more (predominantly Christian) inhabitants from all around the region. In 1700, Yacoub Elias was the first Ramallah native to be ordained by the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, the Christian denomination that prevailed in the Holy Land at the time. In the early 19th century, the first Jerusalemite Greek Orthodox Christian church was built. Later, in 1852, the Greek Orthodox Church of the Transfiguration, was built to replace it; it is the sole Eastern Orthodox Church in Ramallah today.\nThere is also a Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Ramallah, built in 1895. The Roman Catholic Church also established its presence in Ramallah the 19th century and constitutes today the second-largest Christian denomination in the city. The Roman Catholic Church established the St. Joseph's Girls' School run by St. Joseph sisters, as well as the co-educational Al-Ahliyyah College high school run by Rosary sisters. In 1913, construction of the Catholic Holy Family Church was started.\nAs of 2022, Ramallah also has a Coptic Orthodox Church, an Evangelical Lutheran Church and an Episcopalian (Anglican) Church. In the 19th century, the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) established a presence in Ramallah and built the Ramallah Friends Schools, one for girls and later a boys' school, to alleviate the dearth of education for women and girls. Eli and Sybil Jones opened \"The Girls Training Home of Ramallah\" in 1869. A medical clinic was established in 1883, with Dr. George Hassenauer serving as the first doctor in Ramallah. In 1889, the girls academy became the Friends Girls School (FGS). As the FGS was also a boarding school, it attracted a number of girls from surrounding communities, including Jerusalem, Lydda, Jaffa, and Beirut. The Friends Boys School (FBS) was founded in 1901 and opened in 1918. The Quakers opened a Friends Meeting House for worship in the city center in 1910. According to the school's official website, most high school students choose to take the International Baccalaureate exams (IBE) instead of the traditional \"Tawjihi\" university exams.\nThe activity of foreign churches in Palestine in the late 19th century increased awareness of prosperity in the West. In Ramallah and Bethlehem, a few miles south, local residents began to seek economic opportunity overseas. In 1901, merchants from Ramallah emigrated to the United States and established import-export businesses, selling handmade rugs and other exotic wares across the Atlantic. Increased trade dramatically improved living standards for Ramallah's inhabitants. American cars, mechanized farming equipment, radios, and later televisions became attainable luxuries for upper-class families. As residents of Jaffa and Lydda moved to Ramallah, the balance of Muslims and Christians began to change.\nIn the 21st century, a large community of people with direct descent from the Haddadins who founded Ramallah live in the United States. The town is now predominately Muslim, but still contains a Christian minority. The change in demographics is due mostly to new migration of Muslims to the area, and emigration of Christians from the area.\n\nCulture\nRamallah is generally considered the most affluent and cultural, as well as the most liberal, of all Palestinian cities, and is home to a number of popular Palestinian activists, poets, artists, and musicians.\nIn 2004 the Ramallah Cultural Palace opened in the city. The only cultural center of its kind in the Palestinian-governed areas, it houses a 736-seat auditorium, as well as conference rooms, exhibit halls, and movie-screening rooms. It was a joint venture of the Palestinian Authority, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Japanese government. Ramallah hosted its first annual international film festival in 2004.\n\nPalestinian costume\nUntil the 1940s, traditional Palestinian costumes reflected a woman's economic and marital status and her town or district of origin, with knowledgeable observers discerning this information from the fabric, colours, cut, and embroidery motifs (or lack thereof) used in the apparel.\nVillages in the Levant under Ottoman rule remained isolated due to the difficulty of travel in the 19th century. As a result, clothing and accessories became a statement of region. In Ramallah, the back panels of dresses often incorporated a palm tree motif embroidered in cross-stitch.\n\nInternational relations\nMany foreign nations have located their diplomatic missions to the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, including, as of 2010, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Korea, South Africa, Norway, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, China, Poland, Portugal, The Netherlands, Russia, Jordan, Brazil, Finland, Denmark, Ireland, Germany, India, Japan, the Czech Republic, Canada and Mexico.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nRamallah is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nPaul Ajlouny (b. 1933), Palestinian-American publisher and businessman\nHamze Awawde (b. 1990), Palestinian peace activist\nMahmoud Eid (b. 1993), professional footballer\nAmber Fares, Lebanese Canadian filmmaker\nYasmeen Mjalli (born 1996), American and Palestinian fashion designer, photographer and anti-street harassment activist.\nJibril Rajoub (b. 1953), Palestinian political leader, former militant\nMosab Hassan Yousef (b. 1978), Palestinian ex-militant and defector\n\nSee also\nPalestinian Christians\nEconomy of the State of Palestine\nAl-Ram, Palestinian town few km southeast of Ramallah\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nRamallah City Archived October 16, 2012, at the Wayback Machine\nWelcome To The City of Ramallah\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 17:  IAA, Wikimedia commons\nRamallah History\nMusic and Art from Ramallah Archived January 21, 2009, at the Wayback Machine\nQuaker Meeting in Ramallah\nWest Bank/Palestine\nRamallah\nAl Kasaba Theatre\nKhalil Sakakini Cultural Centre\nFirst Ramallah Group\nRamallah International Film Festival Archived June 17, 2013, at the Wayback Machine\nRamallahOnline.com\nRamallah Club of Metro Detroit\nJnewswire.com, Ramallah ancient synagogue\nAnne Brunswic's book Welcome to Palestine, English translation",

الّا ان الاشهر بينهما هي مدينه رام الله.\n\nتحتل رام الله حاليًا مركزًا سياسيًا يجعلها من اهم المدن الفلسطينيه، اذ انها تُعتبر العاصمه الاداريه المؤقته للسلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه، وفيها الى جانب مدينه البيره مقر الرئاسه الفلسطينيه، ومبنى المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني، والمقرات العامه للاجهزه الامنيه الفلسطينيه في الضفه الغربيه، بالاضافه الى معظم مكاتب ووزارات السلطه. كما تعتبر العاصمه الثقافيه لوجود

تاريخيًا منطقه مسيحيه، الا ان معظم سكانها اليوم هم من المسلمين، مع وجود قوي لاقليه مسيحيه.\n\nالتسميه\nتضاربت الاقوال عن تسميه رام الله اذ عرفت في التوراه باسم (رامَتايم صوفيم) وذكرها المؤرخ يوسيفوس باسم (فكولا)، وقيل (جلبات ايلوهم). وقد اثبت الاثريون عدم صحه هذه الاسماء لان امكنه الملوك التي نسبت اليهم مثل الملك صموئيل وشاؤول مختلفه عن المدينه الحاليه.\nالا ان هناك تفسيرات اقرب الى الصحه اذ تعني كلمه رام المنطقه المرتفعه، وهي كلمه كنعانيه منتشره في اماكن مختلفه في فلسطين، واضاف اليها العرب كلمه الله فاصبحت رام الله، وقد عرفها الصليبيون بهذا الاسم، ولكن الثابت تاريخيا ان قبيله عربيه جاءت في اواخر القرن السادس عشر وسكنت في قريه او غابه حرجيه اسمها رام الله.\n\nالتاريخ\nنظرا لان رام الله والبيره تمتدان عمرانيا بشكل متصل، اذ لا يمكن فصل تاريخ المدينتين عن بعضها الاخر، فمن الطبيعي ان يتم دراسه تاريخهما بشكل متكامل. وتشير الدراسات التاريخيه والاثريه الى ان قصه النبي يوسف قد حدثت في منطقه رام الله والبيره، ولقد اختلف المؤرخون في تحديد البئر الذي القي فيه النبي يوسف، وعلى الرغم من هذا الاختلاف فان موقع البيره الحالي لا يبتعد كثيرا عن هذه التوقعات بسبب وقوعه على طريق القوافل المتجهه من الجنوب الى الشمال او بالعكس، وكان هذا الموقع الذي كانت تحط به الرحال طلباً للراحه والاستجمام وسعياً وراء الطعام والماء، وكان يوجد في البيره نبع ماء قديم كان معروفا لتلك القوافل، ما حفز الاهالي في ذلك الوقت الى اقامه اكثر من بناء لتزويد المسافرين بحاجاتهم من الطعام لقاء مال او مبادله تجاريه، وقد ذكر الانجيل ان السيد المسيح كان يمر بالبيره في طريقه من القدس الى الناصره (تخلف مع فتيان البيره الذين كانوا يلهون ويلعبون على نبع الماء وهكذا ضل عن امه وعن يوسف النجار، مما اضطرها الى العوده الى القدس لكي تبحث عنه).\nعند الفتح الاسلامي لبلاد الشام في القرن السابع الميلادي دخلت البيره في حوزه المسلمين، وبنى المسلمون في الفتره الاسلاميه المبكره مسجدين بالقرب من الخان ما زالا مستخدمين حتى اليوم، يعرف الاول منهما باسم «الجامع العمري»، وهو الجامع الملاصق لكنيسه العائله المقدسه وسط البلده القديمه، «وجامع العين» الواقع على عين شارع القدس- نابلس بالقرب من مبنى البلديه الحالي. وتغير مركز مدينه البيره من عصر الى اخر، ويبدو ان اقدم موقع استوطنه اهل البيره هو منطقه الارسال، ثم تل النصبه، ثم عين ام الشرايط، ثم موقع البلده القديمه الحالي، اما الان فقد توسعت حدود المدينه فشملت كل هذه المناطق. وفي سنه 1099 وقعت في ايدي الغزاه الفرنجه قبل احتلالهم لمدينه القدس، واقاموا فيها فتره من الزمن وكانت مركزاً ممتازاً. في عام 1187 عبر جنود المسلمين بقياده صلاح الدين البيره ومن ثم استطاع صلاح الدين انتزاع القدس من ايدي الصليبين.\nكانت رام الله في فتره الحروب الصليبيه مستعمره زراعيه الى جوار البيره، اطلق الصليبيون عليها اسم \"Ramallie\" او \"Ramalie\" حيث توجد بقايا برج صليبي في البلده القديمه لرام الله، ويقال ان رام الله وبعض البلدان الاخرى قد اوقف الملك قلاوون عُشر منتوجات اراضيها على حرم الخليل. الا انها لم تكن معروفه حتى القرن السادس عشر بسبب صغر مساحتها وقله عدد سكانها بالمقارنه بالقرى المحيطه بها.\n\nالدوله العثمانيه\nاسست مدينه رام الله على يد شيخ احدى عشائر الكرك المسيحيه يدعى الشيخ راشد الحدادين، قرر الجلو عن موطنه بسبب خلافات عشائريه في القرن السادس عشر. ويحكى انه جلى من الكرك ليلا وبعد ايام دخل على اهل البيره فرحبوا به. واشاروا عليه بخربه اسمها رام الله لتكون موطنه. اشترى الشيخ راشد خربه رام الله من عائلات البيره القدامى، دون ان يعلم انه كان يؤسس لمدينه سيكون لها دور هام في تاريخ الفلسطينيين.\nوتجسد تماثيل الاسود الخمسه الواقعه في ساحه المناره وسط مدينه رام الله تاريخ المدينه، حيث قام النحات ابو صادق غانم بنحتها لترمز لابناء راشد الحدادين الخمسه، عواد، ويوسف، وجغب، وشقره، وشراقه، والذين انبثقت منهم عائلات رام الله.\nوقد بدا في رام الله مع نهايه القرن التاسع عشر تاسيس مدارس كانت من اولى المدارس النظاميه في فلسطين، اسمها «الفرندز» وتعني (الاصدقاء)، وهي من المدارس التبشيريه التي بادرت الى ايجادها جماعه الكويكرز وهي منظمه دينيه مسيحيه اميركيه. وتضم مدرستين في رام الله والبيره، الاولى للبنات وتعود للعام 1889 والاخرى للصبيان تعود للعام 1901. وكلتاهما تتبعان لمجلس امناء واحد ويزيد عدد طلابهما الان عن الالف.\n\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عام 1917، سقطت رام الله بيد الجيش الانجليزي، ودخلت المدينه مع باقي مدن فلسطين مظله الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين عام 1920، واصبحت رام الله مركزا لقضاء رام الله في تلك الفتره حتى وقوع النكبه. كانت المدنيه قد ازدادت اهميه في هذه الفتره نتيجه ثلاثه تطورات مهمه: اولها انشاء اعمده الارسال الشاهقه لـ «محطه الاذاعه الفلسطينيه» من قبل حكومه الانتداب البريطانيه عام 1936 على اراضي قريه البيره التي يقع مدخلها على الشارع الرئيسي المتجه الى قريه بيرزيت وقرى بني زيد. وهو الشارع الذي اصبح اسمه منذ ذلك الحين «شارع الاذاعه» او «شارع الارسال». وللشارع اهميه كبيره في ذلك الوقت نظرا لوجود عدد من الفنادق «كفندق الحمراء» و«فندق حرب» وكان يجذب اهالي مدينه رام الله والقدس ايام الاحاد للاستمتاع بالجلوس في احضان الطبيعه.\nاما التطور الثاني فقد جاء نتيجه الثوره الفلسطينيه الكبرى 1936-1939، حيث اقامت حكومه الانتداب على غرار ما جرى في بقيه المدن الفلسطينيه، المبنى الضخم المعروف حاليا بمبنى المقاطعه (مبنى تجاري على اسم المهندس البريطاني الذي صمم هذه المباني لتستوعب الدوائر الحكوميه والسجون ...الخ). وبالتالي فقد اصبحت معنيه بتوسيع شبكه الطرق القريبه لتستوعب الضغط الناجم عن انشاء هذا المبنى ومحطه الاذاعه. اما التطور الثالث فكان له علاقه بالهجره الى الاميركيتين من قبل سكان رام الله والبيره وتعاظم ثروه اهل المدينتين مما ادى الى توسع عمراني كبير على امتداد الشوارع الجديده وخارج اطار المسطحات القديمه والمتراصه نسبيا.\nوقد ادت هذه التطورات الى توسيع شبكه الطرق في المدينتين، وخصوصا توسيع وتعبيد طريق الاذاعه وانجاز خريطه التنظيم الهيكليه لرام الله عام 1940. وهكذا اخذت شبكه الطرق المتفرعه عن الميدان شكلها النهائي رغم ان المنطقه المحيطه بالميدان ظلت في معظمها خاليه اساسا من العمران. اذ لم تجر خلال الحرب العالميه الثانيه تطورات عمرانيه تذكر فظروف الحرب قد حالت دون الحصول على مواد البناء وخصوصا الاسمنت والحديد حيث احتفظت بهما حكومه الانتداب للاغراض الحربيه.\nقرار التقسيم\n\nقامت هيئه الامم المتحده عام 1947 بمحاوله لايجاد حل للنزاع العربي/اليهودي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئه الامم بتشكيل لجنه UNSCOP المتالّفه من دول متعدّده باستثناء الدّول دائمه العضويه لضمان الحياد في عمليه ايجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنه بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الاول باقامه دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينه القدس من قِبل اداره دوليه. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تاسيس فيدراليه تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهوديه والعربيه. ومال معظم افراد لجنه UNSCOP تجاه المشروع الاول والرامي لتاسيس دولتين مستقلّتين باطار اقتصدي موحد. وقامت هيئه الامم بقبول مشروع لجنه UNSCOP الدّاعي للتقسيم مع اجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركه بين الدولتين، العربيه واليهوديه، على ان يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nاعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من ارض فلسطين للدوله اليهوديه، وشملت حصّه اليهود من ارض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من اسدود الى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينه يافا) واغلبيه مساحه صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينه بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصريه). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحه للزراعه ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الارض الفلسطينيه على اماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهوديه بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدوله اليهوديه. وكانت رام الله في ذلك الوقت مركزا لقضاء رام الله، التي تم الحاقها بالدوله العربيه المُقترحه.\n\nالاداره الاردنيه\nوفي اوائل خمسينيات القرن العشرين خضعت رام الله للحكم الاردني بين حربي 1948 و1967، واصبحت رام الله فيما بعد مركزا للواء رام الله التابع لمحافظه القدس. وقد كانت المدينه هادئه نسبيا خلال سنوات الحكم الاردني، وكان السكان يتمتعون بحريه الحركه بين الضفه الغربيه والاردن ولبنان وسوريا واماكن اخرى. وكان الاردن بضم الضفه الغربيه، يطبق قانونه على الارض. ومع ذلك، سجن كثير من الفلسطينيين لكونهم اعضاء في ما كانت الحكومه الاردنيه تعتبره احزاب سياسيه غير مشروعه، بما في ذلك الحزب الشيوعي الفلسطيني وغيرها من الجماعات الاشتراكيه والمؤيده للاستقلال. وضع القانون الاردني قيودا على الابداع والحريه المطلوبه من قبل العديد من الفلسطينيين في ذلك الوقت. بحلول عام 1953، تضاعف سكان رام الله، ولكنها لم تكن مجهزه للاقتصاد والبنيه التحتيه للتعامل مع تدفق القرويين الفقراء. غادر اهالي مدينه رام الله، في المقام الاول الى الولايات المتحده. ونظراً لكون مدينه رام الله مركز للواء فقد استاثرت بنصيب وافر من مراكز الخدمات الاداريه والتعليميه والصحيه والاجتماعيه والاقتصاديه يشرف عليها المجلس البلدي والذي قام بتاسيس شركه المياه، وغرفه التجاره تاسست عام 1950م وغايتها تسهيل الاعمال التجاريه.\n\nحرب 1967\nسقطت المدينه في يد اسرائيل بعد عام 1967، لتظل تحت الاحتلال لمده 27 سنه وتعاني من الاهمال الاسرائيلي لها كباقي المدن العربيه الفلسطينيه المحتله. وقد صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات شائعه من اراضي رام الله وقراها واقامت عليها العديد من المستوطنات، وقد بلغ عدد المستوطنات حتى نهايه عام 1987م حوالي 30 مستوطنه، واكبر هذه المستوطنات مستوطنه (ريمونيم) وهي قريه تعاونيه انشات عام 1980م.\nفي عام 1987، انخرط سكان مدينه رام الله بوقت مبكر في الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الاولى. وكانت القياده الوطنيه الموحده للانتفاضه، تقوم بتوزيع النشرات الاسبوعيه في شوارع رام الله مع جدول زمني للاضراب المتصاحب مع الاحتجاجات اليوميه ضد الدوريات الاسرائيليه في المدينه. وفي المظاهرات، تم احراق الاطارات في الشوارع، كما القى الحشود الحجاره والزجاجات الحارقه على جنود الاحتلال. ورد الجيش الاسرائيلي بالغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي. واغلقت المدارس في مدينه رام الله قسرا، وفتحت تدريجيا لبضع ساعات. ونفذت الاعتقالات خارج البيوت، وفرض حظر التجول ومنع السفر، ما اعتبره الفلسطينيون بانه عقاب جماعي. ردا على اغلاق المدارس، وتنظيم دورات تعليم سكان المنزل لمساعده الطلاب على استدراك الماده الفائته، وهذا اصبح واحدا من الرموز القليله من العصيان المدني.\nفي عام 1991، ضم الوفد الفلسطيني الى مؤتمر مدريد للسلام الدولي العديد من وجهاء رام الله. كما خفت حده الانتفاضه قدما، واستانفت الحياه الطبيعيه في رام الله. في ديسمبر 1995، وذلك تامشيا مع اتفاق اوسلو، تخلى الجيش الاسرائيلي عن المقاطعه وانسحب الى ضواحي المدينه. تولت السلطه الفلسطينيه التي انشئت حديثا المدنيه والمسؤوليه الامنيه للمدينه، والتي اعتبرت «المنطقه ا» الخاضعه للاتفاقات.\n\nالسلطه الفلسطينيه\nفي 1994 تم نقل الحكم فيها للسلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه بموجب اتفاق اوسلو الموقع عام 1993، التي اُعلن بموجبه عن مناطق المدينه (دون القرى التابعه لها او امتداداتها) انها منطقه الف (ا)؛ وهذه الارض تخضع لسيطره شبه كامله من السلطه الفلسطينيه. اصبحت رام الله المقر المؤقت للسلطه الفلسطينيه، وبسبب رفض اسرائيل ان يكون مقر السلطه الفلسطينيه في القدس الشرقيه. وقد شهدت المدينه نهضه حضاريه ومعماريه كبيره في هذه الفتره.\nتعرّض كثير من تلك المقرات في رام الله الى دمار كبير الحقته اله الحرب الاسرائيليه كجزء من الهجمات المستمره على المدينه في فتره الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه، مما ادّى الى تعطيلها الى حدِّ كبير، وعادت هذه المقرات للعمل في الفتره اللاحقه للاجتياح الاسرائيلي الكبير للمدينه في عام 2002 جاعله رام الله العاصمه الاداريه (كامر واقع) لسلطه الحكم الذاتي الفلسطينيه. يشار بالذكر الى ان حكومه نتنياهو شرعت في اعداد دراسه تهدف الى اقناع الفلسطينيين باهميه مدينه رام الله كعاصمه بديله من القدس الشرقيه. وتركز الدراسه على التذكير بمواقف اسحق رابين الذي ثبت مدينه القدس بقسميها الغربي والشرقي، عاصمه ابديه موحده لدوله اليهود، ومع انه وافق على فصل الشان السياسي عن الشان الديني، ووعد المسلمين والمسيحيين بممارسه شعائرهم في ظل القانون الاسرائيلي، الا انه اخضع وعده لضرورات الامن القومي. لهذا السبب لم يسمح لياسر عرفات بزياره القدس خوفاً من الجماهير التي ستستقبله.\n\nالجغرافيا\nرام الله مدينه جبليه، مبنيه على جبال مطله الى الغرب على الساحل الفلسطيني، اما من جهه الشرق والجنوب فهي محاطه بالجبال. تبعد رام الله حوالي عشره 15 كم الى الشمال من القدس وتبعد المدينه عن البحر المتوسط الذي يرى من تلالها حوالي 45 كيلومترا هوائيا وكثيرا ما تشاهد منها اثناء النهار السفن الراسيه، كما تبعد عن نهر الاردن قرابه 33 كم الى الغرب. ونظرا لقرب البحر منها فان الهواء الذي يهب عليها من الغرب يحمل معه بعض الرطوبه ولكن ارتفاع البلده عن سطح البحر الذي يتراوح بين 830-880 مترا يلطف من هذه الرطوبه. وتبلغ مساحه مدينه رام الله 19 الف دونم، واتخذت مجالس بلديه سابقه قرارا بتوسيع حدود المدينه الى الفي دونم اخرى.\nويتوسط موقع رام الله فلسطين التاريخيه تقريبا، حيث تبعد عن نابلس 36 كم الى الجنوب، وجنين 63 كم الى الجنوب، والخليل 82 كم الى الشمال، وغزه 82 كم الى الشمال الشرقي، ويافا 45 كم الى الشرق، وحيفا 105 كم الى الجنوب الشرقي.\n\nمناطق المدينه\nتُقسم المدينه الى 19 حيًا وهي: الريحان، الدبلوماسي، الكرينعه، الواد، النرجس، الطيره، المصايف، الاذاعه، ردانا، عين مصباح، الجدول، قدوره، القديره، الماصيون، عين منجد، باطن الهواء، مركز المدينه، البلده القديمه والمنطقه الصناعيه. اما بالنسبه للطرق، فتقطع رام الله عده طرق تربط مناطقها ببعض، كما تربطها بالمدن الملتصقه بها كـالبيره وبيتونيا، وباقي قرى ومدن فلسطين المجاوره كالقدس وبيت لحم ونابلس، والتي قامت بلديه رام الله بتسميتها على اسماء لمناطق وشخصيات فلسطينيه او عالميه، ومن اهم هذه الطرق:\n\nالمناخ\nمناخ رام الله هو مناخ متوسطي ففي الشتاء تتعرض البلده للرياح الجنوبيه الغربيه القاسيه الماطره واحيانا الى رياح شماليه شرقيه جافه بارده نسبيا. اما معدل سقوط الامطار هو حوالي 20 انشا او 500 مليمتر في السنه. وعلى العموم فان معدل درجه الحراره في الشتاء نادرا ما يصل الى 32 فهرنهايت او صفر مئوي وفي الصيف قلما تزيد على 95 ف او 35 درجه مئويه ويمكننا القول بان معدل درجه الحراره السنوي يتراوح بين 41-77 ف او 5-25 م.\nوفي اوائل نيسان تاخذ الرياح الخماسينيه بالهبوب وهذه رياح جافه تحمل معها كثيرا من الغبار وهي تاتينا من الجنوب وينقطع هبوب الرياح الخماسينيه كلما اقترب فصل الصيف وتهب ايضا على البلده رياح دافئه في اواخر الصيف واوائل الخريف وتعجل بانهاء موسمي العنب والتين. وعلى العموم فان مناخ رام الله لطيف منعش في الصيف دافئ في الشتاء وهذا جعل الحياه فيها حياه نشاط وعمل.\n\nالسكان\nالجدول الاتي يبين عدد سكان المدينه في فترات مختلفه:\n\nيبلغ عدد سكان رام الله اليوم قرابه 30 الف نسمه. وبالرغم من ان رام الله كانت مدينه صغيره، الا ان اللاجئين الفلسطينيين بعد النكبه عام 1948 شكلوا جزءا رئيسيا من التوزيع السكاني الجديد، كما ان الهجره الداخليه وانتقال فلسطينيين للعمل في رام الله بعد قدوم سلطه الحكم الذاتي الفلسطينيه جراء تحولها الى مركز اداري للسلطه زاد من عدد السكان المستقرين القادمين من مدن اخرى.\nوقد بلغ عدد سكان رام الله عام 1922م حوالي 3067 نسمه، وفي عام 1945م 5080 نسمه، وفي عام 1967م بلغ عدد سكانها حسب الاحصاء الاسرائيلي 12134 نسمه، ارتفع هذا العدد ليصل عام 1987م حوالي 24772 نسمه.\nتتمتع رام الله عن باقي المدن الفلسطينيه باستمراريه وتعدديه بالنشاطات الثقافيه بين المهرجانات والندوات والمؤتمرات والمعارض، ويعود ذلك الى عده اسباب، احدها تمركز عدد كبير من المؤسسات الناشطه في هذا المجال في مدينه رام الله اضافه الى نشاط بلديه رام الله في هذا المجال ووجود وزاره الثقافه التابعه لسلطه الحكم الذاتي الفلسطيني في المدينه. وكذلك تنوع النسيج الثقافي الاجتماعي في المدينه واتساع هامش الحريه مما جذب العديد من الشخصيات الثقافيه الى مدينه رام الله من مخرجين وكتّاب وشعراء.\nمن المؤسسات العامله في مجال الثقافه في المدينه مركز الفن الشعبي ومعهد ادوارد سعيد للموسيقى ومسرح وسينماتك القصبه ومؤسسه سريه رام الله الاولى والقصر الثقافي التابع لبلديه المدينه ومركز بلدنا الثقافي ورواق وشاشات ومسرح عشتار ومركز خليل السكاكيني الثقافي ومؤسسه الكمنجاتي وجالاري المحطه ومؤسسه تامر ومنتدى الفنانين الصغار والمركز الثقافي البريطاني ومؤسسه عبد المحسن القطان ومتحف محمود درويش والمركز الثقافي اليوناني والمؤسسه الفلسطينيه للفن المعاصر والمركز الثقافي الفرنسي الالماني.\n\nالاقتصاد\nتعكس رام الله صوره مدينه مزدهره تشهد حركه اعمال محمومه وفوره عقاريه كست تلالها بالمباني، غير ان هذه المدينه التي تحتضن مقر السلطه الفلسطينيه في الضفه الغربيه تبقى استثناء في مشهد اقتصادي عام هش.\nولقد مارس سكان مدينه رام الله والبيره العديد من الحرف منذ القدم، منها الزراعه وتربيه المواشي حيث زرعوا العنب والتين والزيتون، واشتغل السكان في التجاره حيث تنقل التجار بين المدن والقرى المجاوره، كما اشتغل السكان في الصناعه مثل صناعه الاحذيه والملابس والمواد الغذائيه والفخار واستمر الحال حتى اوائل القرن العشرين، حيث اتجه السكان الى الهجره الى امريكا خصوصا الشباب منهم، فاخذت الاموال تتدفق على المدينه ليستثمرها السكان في شراء الاراضي وبناء العقارات لاستغلالها في السياحه، وازدادت حركه التعليم وما ان انتهت الحرب العالميه الثانيه حتى وقعت حرب 1948 فكان معظم سكان المدينه قد هاجروا الى امريكا باستثناء 12% منهم بقوا في المدينه.\nتوجد حاليا العديد من الصناعات مثل صناعه الورق الصحي والكرتون والاثاث والمواد الغذائيه وعصر الزيتون والصابون والالمنيوم والادويه والكثير من الحرف اليدويه والتقليديه.\nاما بالنسبه للزراعه فقد اضمحلت بسبب هجره السكان للاراضي الزراعيه وتحويلها بنايات لتاخذ مكان البيوت القديمه واصبحت المدينه تعج بمئات المحال التجاريه الممتده.\nومن الملاحظ ان تكلفه المعيشه في مدينه رام الله هي اعلى مستوى من نظيراتها في المحافظات الاخرى، ويمكن ارجاع السبب الى عده عوامل، اهمها وجود شريحه واسعه في رام الله يفوق مستوى دخلها معدل الدخل لباقي سكان رام الله وباقي سكان المحافظات الاخرى نظرا لعمل هذه الشريحه مع المؤسسات الاجنبيه والدوليه ما يجعلها قادره على تحمّل هذه النفقات، وثانياً وجود عدد كبير من الاجانب العاملين في رام الله ذوي الدخل المرتفع جداً بالمقارنه مع المواطن العادي مما تسبب في زياده الاسعار على كافه المستويات وبالذات العقار والمنافع الخدماتيه كالمطاعم والقاعات، بالاضافه الى وجود تحويلات شبه دائمه من المغتربين من سكان قراها الشرقيه والتي معظم افرادها مغتربون في الولايات المتحده الامريكيه، وهنالك امثله صارخه للقرى الشرقيه للمدينه التي حققت اعلى النسب في اغتراب افرادها الى الولايات المتحده الامريكيه. ويمكن اليوم ان يُقارن مستوى المعيشه في المدينه بنظيره في مدن عالميه اخرى. يشار الى انه يُقام كل عام معرضٌ للصناعات الفلسطينيه في مدينه رام الله.\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nيمكن السفر الى المدن المجاوره لرام الله بواسطه سياره اجره او حافلات صغيره. سيارات الاجره متوفره دائما في جميع انحاء مدينه رام الله، كذلك بالنسبه للحافلات او الحافلات الصغيره. ويتنقل المواطنون الفلسطينيون بين رام الله والمدن والقرى المجاوره - منذ انتفاضه الاقصى - بصعوبه بالغه، حيث يعاني المواطن وفي كثيراً من الاحيان الامرّين حتى يصل الى مبتغاه في الوقت المحدد وربما لا يصله اطلاقاً، مرد ذلك الاجراءات الاسرائيليه من حواجز واغلاقات.\nيقع جنوب رام الله في بلده قلنديا، مطار القدس الدولي او كما تشيع تسميته «مطار قلنديا»، يقع على اراضي محافظه القدس تحديداً في بلده قلنديا على طريق (القدس - رام الله). يعتبر المطار اقرب الى رام الله منه الى مدينه القدس.\nانشيء المطار عام 1920 تحت اداره الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين ثم في اوائل الخمسينيات وضع تحت الاداره الاردنيه بعد انضمام الضفه الغربيه الى المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه، الا انه وقع بيد القوات الاسرائيليه في حرب 1967، والتي سرعان ما غيرت اسمه الى «مطار عطاروت». ومنذ انتفاضه الاقصى والمطار مهمل بالرغم من انه تحت سيطره الجيش الاسرائيلي. شهد المطار حركه سياحيه وتجاريه نشطه في الخمسينيات والستينيات، وقد استخدمه الكثير من المسافرين واصحاب الشخصيات الهامه مثل بابا الفاتيكان على سبيل المثال لا الحصر، وذلك لاهميه القدس الدينيه والسياحيه.\n\nالاتصالات\nتقع في رام الله مقرات شركات الاتصال الفلسطينيه التي تزود الضفه الغربيه بهذه الخدمه (جوال والوطنيه موبايل). تاسست مجموعه الاتصالات الفلسطينيه عام 1995 في رام الله، وكانت اول شركه اتصالات مملوكه للقطاع الخاص في العالم العربي وباشرت اعمالها في يناير عام 1997 كمشغل ومقدم لكافه انواع خدمات الاتصالات في فلسطين. تتكون المجموعه اليوم من شركه الاتصالات الفلسطينيه، وشركه جوال المزود الفلسطيني الاول لخدمه الاتصال الخلوي في فلسطين وشركه «حضاره» لخدمات الاتصالات وتكنولوجيا المعلومات بالاضافه الى شركه «حلول» لتكنولوجيه المعلومات وشركه «بال ميديا» لتقديم الخدمات المرئيه والاعلاميه المميزه. بالاضافه الى هذه الشركات تقوم شركه الوطنيه موبايل بتزويد خدمات الاتصالات الخليويه ايضا، والتي اطلقت خدماتها تجارياً في 2009.\n\nالعماره والتخطيط الحضري\nتمتاز مدينه رام الله بغناها المعماري وتطورها الاجتماعي والذي انعكس عبر مبانيها وحاراتها وتجمع ساكنيها، حيث يشعر الزائر بمتابعه بصريه جميله تعطيه الاحساس والشعور بكينونته كانسان بمقاييسها الانسانيه والاحساس بالزمن ببعديه الماضي والمستقبلي للواجهات والاسقف والخانات والازقه. وتعتبر المدينه اكبر تجمع من حيث عدد المباني القديمه في محافظه رام الله، بحيث تحتوي على 381 مبنى قديماً، وتشكل ما نسبته 5 % من عدد المباني الكلي في المحافظه، وتليها بذلك رنتيس، حيث تحتوي على 326 مبنى، ثم نعلين بـ 292 مبنى، ومن ثم عابود بـ 281 مبنى قديماً.\nوقد تاسس في بدايه تسعينيات القرن الفائت، مركز معني بالحفاظ على الهويه المعماريه الفلسطينيه القديمه في رام الله، اسمه: مركز المعمار الشعبي \"رواق\"، والذي عمل على تحضير مخططات حمايه للمباني في التجمعات، وبخاصه تلك التي ما زالت تحافظ على مراكزها ونسيجها المعماري القديم، وكذلك تلك التي تحتوي على عدد كبير من المباني القديمه، بحيث تتم حمايه اكبر نسبه ممكنه من المباني القديمه بمجرد حمايه بعض التجمعات، ولذلك يمكن حمايه ما نسبته 35.41 % من عدد المباني القديمه بمجرد حمايه التجمعات التي تحتوي على اكثر من 200 مبنى قديم.\nوقد قامت وحده التخطيط في مركز رواق، باعداد مخطط الحفاظ على التراث الثقافي للبلده القديمه في رام الله. حيث تم تعيين حدود وجميع فئات التراث الثقافي في المنطقه التاريخيه (من مباني تاريخيه، واحواش، وازقه...الخ) وذلك بناءً على الدراسه الميدانيه التي قام بها فريق العمل في الموقع.\nنتيجه ذلك تم تقسيم البلده القديمه الى منطقتين: «منطقه تاريخيه ا» والتي تتميز بنسيج معماري تقليدي وعدد كبير من المباني التاريخيه، و«منطقه تاريخيه ب» والتي لم تعد تحتفظ بنسيج معماري تقليدي بالرغم من وجود عدد لا باس به من المباني التاريخيه. هذا وتم تعين كل المباني التاريخيه المنفرده خارج هاتين المنطقتين.\nكما وتم وضع مسوده احكام خاصه لتنظيم اعمال البناء في تللك المناطق، والتي تم نقاشها مطولاً مع لجنه احياء البلده القديمه المكونه من اعضاء في مجلس بلديه رام الله. هذا وتم اقرار جزء من هذه الاحكام من قبل لجنه التنظيم في البلديه.\n\nالثقافه والسياحه\nان ما يميز مدينه رام الله هو هذا التناغم والتنوع والاختلاف في اطار الوحده، ولكثره من رغب بالسكن في رام الله بسبب هذا الميل العام نحو قبول الاخر، جعل منها مكان جذب للكثيرين من مختلف المناطق والبيئات والاديان ممن بحثوا عن الامن والامان. وقد خلق هذا الامر ايضاً تنوعاً ثقافياً وحضارياً فريداً، ووجد الجميع فيه ما يصبون اليه فتشكلت هذه المدينه المنوعه في ثقافتها وتوجهاتها في اطار من التواصل الغريب.\nتعتبر رام الله مركز للحياه الثقافيه والاكثر انفتاحا وليبراليه في الضفه الغربيه، ما دفع البعض الى تسميتها «روح الثقافه» فهي تضم العديد من المكتبات مثل: مكتبه دار الاذاعه ومكتبه رام الله العامه بالاضافه الى العديد من المراكز الثقافيه على تنوعها، فهناك العامله في اطار الفنون البصريه، او السينما او المسرح، او الرقص الشعبي والمعاصر، او الشعر والادب والنشر، او المؤسسات الموسيقيه.\nوتعتبر رام الله مركزا للعديد من المراكز الثقافيه الاجنبيه كالمركز الثقافي الالماني الفرنسي، والمركز الثقافي البريطاني، والمركز الثقافي اليوناني.\nولتطريز الاثواب في رام الله نكهه خاصه فهي لغه للتعبير وحاله نادره ومميزه عن بقيه المناطق الاخرى، بحيث يدمج بين الاشكال الهندسيه والمجرده المستطيله (كالمربعات، والنجوم) وبين الصور الرمزيه، ما يعكس الحياه اليوميه لاهل رام الله وسكانها. ومن اهم المهرجانات التي تقام خصيصا من اجل الحفاظ على هذا التراث، مهرجان الوفاء للتراث وارث الاجداد السنوي الذي ينظمه نادي شباب رام الله، حيث يتم تنظيم عرضاً للازياء التراثيه الفلسطينيه.\nكما وتضم عددا من المراكز الرياضيه، والانديه الشبابيه الفاعله، والتي يعود تاسيس بعضها الى بدايات القرن الماضي، في حين تضم بعض هذه الانديه فرقا كشفيه عريقه كان لها حضورها على مدار التاريخ الفلسطيني. من المؤسسات العامله في مجال الثقافه في المدينه مركز الفن الشعبي ومعهد ادوارد سعيد للموسيقى ومسرح وسينماتك القصبه ومؤسسه سريه رام الله الاولى والقصر الثقافي التابع لبلديه المدينه ومركز بلدنا الثقافي ورواق وشاشات ومسرح عشتار ومركز خليل السكاكيني الثقافي

في مجملها، ويعود تاسيس بعضها الى اربعينيات القرن الماضي، وتهدف هذه الجمعيات التي تضاعفت اعدادها مرارا في العقدين الاخيرين، الى توفير الدعم للعديد من فئات المجتمع، ومن بينها المراه، الطفل، كبار السن، ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصه، الايتام، وغيرهم.\n\nتعتبر مدينه رام الله واحده من المدن الفلسطينيه التي يؤمها السياح، وتشكل وجهه رئيسيه لهم في جولاتهم السياحيه، ولا بد للسائح ان يزور مواقعها الاثريه التي تقسم الى: انقاض بناء اثري فيه بقايا برج من حقبه الصليبيين يقع في وسط المدينه، واثار كنيسه بيزنطيه في المدينه.\nوبالرغم من ان المدينه ليست من المدن القديمه جدا الا انها تعد اكثر المناطق الفلسطينيه جذبا للزائرين على المستوى العالمي والعربي عامه والفلسطينيين خاصه، اخذين بعين الاعتبار ان هذه المدينه مركزا اقتصاديا مهما، وخاصه بعد ان اصبحت مقرا للمصارف الفلسطينيه والعربيه، ومركزا للمؤسسات الاجنبيه، والممثليات الدبلوماسيه، كما ومقرا لمؤسسات ووزارات السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه...الخ، مما ساهم بشكل فعال في تطور هذه المدينه من كافه النواحي وخاصه سياحيا، فازدحام المدينه يعني بناء المرافق السياحيه الكبيره والحديثه القادره على تلبيه احتياجات ساكنيها، وهذا من شانه ان يزيد الدخل القومي بشكل كبير. ويوجد في المدينه مركزا معني بالسياحه هو مركز رام الله للمعلومات السياحيه الذي تاسس بدعم سويدي وبالتعاون مع وزاره السياحه الفلسطينيه ومركز رواق للمعمار الشعبي. وهناك الكثير من الاثار الواقعه في قرى وبلدات قضاء رام الله، فمثلا توجد قلعه حصينه لا تزال اثارها ظاهره حتى الان في بيرزيت، مبنى عثماني ضخم في قريه راس كركر، واثار كنيسه وقطع معماريه تعود الى الفترات البيزنطيه في قريه جفنا، كما يوجد في قريه عابود الكثير من الاديره والكنائس المندثره منذ عهد هيلانه وابنها قسطنطين، وفيها ايضا مسجد قديم وكنيسه للروم الارثوذكس. ويزور رام الله سنويا 300,000 سائح. يشار الى ان السياحه في المدينه كغيرها من مدن فلسطين، تواجه العديد من المشاكل والعقبات، ولعل اول تلك العقبات هو الاحتلال الاسرائيلي الذي يؤثر سلبا بدعاياته المغرضه على السياح الاجانب، ويسعى الى ضرب قطاع السياحه في المدينه. كذلك ينافس الاسرائيليون السياحه الفلسطينيه نظرا لخبرتهم في التسويق.\n\nالتعليم والتعليم العالي\nبدا التعليم في رام الله في مدرسه للروم الاورثوذكس انشاتها البطريركيه في القدس حوالي 1840، عندما حضر مبشر من طائفه البروتستانت اسمه صموئيل غوبات واسس خمس مدارس احداها في رام الله، وهي مدرسه تبشيريه، بينما كانت الاولى الارثوذكسيه مدرسه وطنيه، وظلت مدرسه غوبات مفتوحه حتى قبل الحرب العالميه الاولى، وفي سنه 1857 قدم اللاتين الى رام الله، وافتتحوا لهم مدرسه لم تعمر طويلا، اما عن مدارس الاناث، فقد اسست جماعه الفرندز في عام 1889 اول مدرسه من نوعها للاناث في رام الله. والاولى من نوعها في فلسطين، وكان افتتاح هذه المدرسه حافزاً للروم الارثوذكس لانشاء مدرسه للبنات، وحذا حذوهم اللاتين، وفي عام 1901 افتتح الفرندز مدرسه البنين في رام الله.\nوفي رام الله اليوم ثلاث مدارس حكوميه للذكور ومدرستان للاناث، وبعد عام 1950 افتتحت بعض المعاهد مثل معهد المعلمات الحكومي والحق بالمعهد مدرسه للتطبيقات والتجارب التربويه والتعليم فيها مختلط، ولوكاله الغوث اربع مدارس للذكور ومدرستان للاناث في رام الله كما يتبع وكاله الغوث مركز لتدريب المعلمين والفتيات وهناك سبع مدارس خاصه مختلطه وثلاث مدارس خاصه للاناث وواحده للذكور ودار لرعايه

المعهد الوطني للموسيقى ومجموعه كبيره من المنتديات الثقافيه.\nالتعليم العالي\nتقع في محافظه رام الله واحده من الجامعات المميزه فلسطينيا وعربيا، وهي جامعه بيرزيت. يعود تاريخ جامعه بيرزيت الى عام 1924 عندما تاسست كمدرسه ابتدائيه، وكان الهدف الرئيسي للمدرسه توفير فرص التعليم الاوليه للفتيات من بيرزيت والقرى المجاوره في وقت انعدمت فيه المدارس تقريباً في تلك المنطقه.\nتطورت المدرسه لتصبح كليه عام 1942، ولما كانت الكليه عندئذ هي المؤسسه الجامعيه الوحيده في المنطقه، فقد قررت التركيز على التعليم الجامعي، وتقرر ان تصبح الكليه نتيجه لذلك «جامعه بيرزيت» في 1972.\n\nالرياضه\nتلعب في محافظه رام الله العديد من الانديه سواء على مستوى كره القدم او كره السله، منها: مؤسسه شباب البيره، دير عمار، الجلزون، شباب الامعري، ارثوذكسي رام الله، سلواد، بدو، بيت سيرا، وبير زيت الرياضي. ويشارك بعضها في الدوري الفلسطيني الممتاز. ويوجد في المدينه ملعبا بلديا يتسع لعده الاف.\nيقام في مدينه رام الله سباق ماراثون يحمل اسم «القدس عاصمه فلسطين الابديه»، وذلك رداً على سباق مماثل اقيم في المدينه المحتله بمشاركه الاف العدائين الاسرائيليين والاجانب وسط موجه غضب في الشارع الفلسطيني. كما بدات بلديه رام الله باعمال الانشاء لمشروع صاله رام الله الرياضيه. وياتي مشروع الصاله الرياضيه كجزء من الخطه التنمويه

الكبرى.\n\nالمعالم\nرام الله تحت الاحتلال\nمنذ بدايه الانتفاضه الثانيه للفلسطينيين ضد الاحتلال الاسرائيلي واجتياح جيش الاحتلال الاسرائيلي مدن الضفه الغربيه في خريف عام 2000، كانت مدينه رام الله من المدن الرئيسيه في مواجهه العمليات الاسرائيليه بعد مدن جنين، نابلس، طولكرم، الخليل، هذا وقد فرضت قوات الاحتلال الاسرائيليه حظر التجول على المدينه، وخنقت سكانها وعزلتهم عن مدينه القدس حيث يقطن الكثير من اقربائهم.\nو تعيش مدينه رام الله اليوم ظروف صعبه، بسبب الحصار الاسرائيلي ومصادره الكثير من اراضيها من قبل الاحتلال بواسطه جدار الفصل العنصري، والمستوطنين اليهود.\nومع مرور سنوات عديده على الانتفاضه الثانيه، الا ان مدينه رام الله واهلها نجحوا في الحفاظ على نشاط اقتصادي عالي وثقافي مميز، مما جعل المدينه افضل المدن الفلسطينيه حالا في ظل الاحتلال.\n\nالمخيمات\nيوجد في منطقه رام الله، 4 مخيمات 3 منها مُسجله رسميا في وكاله غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (الاونروا) وواحد غير مسجل، وهي مثل باقي المخيمات في الضفه الغربيه، فقد بُني معظمها فوق قطعه من الارض قامت الاونروا باستئجارها من الحكومه الاردنيه. والمخيمات هي:\n\nمخيم الامعري: قام الصليب الاحمر بتاسيس مخيم الامعري في عام 1949 ضمن حدود بلديه البيره، حيث قام بتوفير الخيام للاجئين الذين قدموا من مدن اللد ويافا والرمله، بالاضافه الى الذين لجئوا من قرى بيت دجن ودير طريف وابو شوشه والنعاني وصيدون وجمزو وبيت نبالا. وقد تسلمت الاونروا مسؤوليه المخيم في عام 1950 وعملت على بناء وحدات سكنيه ذات اسقف اسمنتيه. وبحلول عام 1957، كانت الاونروا قد اتمت استبدال كافه الخيام بالمساكن الاسمنتيه؛ حيث حصلت العائلات التي لا يزيد عدد افرادها عن خمسه اشخاص على مسكن مؤلف من غرفه واحده فيما حصلت العائلات الاكبر على مساكن من غرفتين. واليوم، فان المخيم يغطي مساحه من الارض تبلغ 0,93 كيلومتر مربع، ويفصل بين معظم المساكن مساحه تقل عن نصف متر؛ الامر الذي يجعل التهويه داخل المخيم ضعيفه للغايه. ويرتبط المخيم بشكل كامل بشبكتي الماء والكهرباء البلديه.\nمخيم الجلزون: تاسس المخيم عام 1949 فوق مساحه من الارض تبلغ 0.25 كيلومتر مربع على تله صخريه تبعد مسافه 7 كيلومترات شمال رام الله. وينحدر اصل سكان المخيم من 36 قريه تابعه لمناطق اللد والرمله. واصبح المخيم تحت السيطره الاسرائيليه الفلسطينيه المشترك في اعقاب اتفاقيات اوسلو. وتتصل كافه المساكن بالبنيه التحتيه لشبكتي الكهرباء والماء العامه.\nمخيم دير عمار: تاسس المخيم عام 1949 فوق مساحه من الارض تبلغ 0.16 كيلومتر مربع على بعد 30 كيلومتر الى الشمال الغربي من رام الله. وقد بني المخيم فوق قطعه من الارض تعود ملكيتها لسكان قريه دير عمار غير اللاجئين. وفي المقابل، فان منشات الاونروا في المخيم تعمل على توفير خدماتها للقرويين من غير اللاجئين.\nوتنحدر اصول سكان المخيم من القرى المدمره التابعه لمناطق الرمله ويافا واللد. وفي اعقاب اتفاقيات اوسلو، اصبح المخيم واقعا تحت السيطره المشتركه الفلسطينيه الاسرائيليه.\n\nمخيم قدوره: يقع داخل مدينه رام الله بالقرب من مستشفى رام الله الحكومي من جهه الشمال، يبلغ عدد سكانه في منتصف العام 2023 نحو 1040 لاجئ حسب تقديرات الجهاز المركزي للاحصاء الفلسطيني. معظم سكان المخيم من المدن والقرى المهجره عام 1948 منها: دير طريف، واللد، والسافريه، وبيت نبالا، والرمله، ولفتا، وابو غوش، والقباب، ويافا، وسلمه، وزكريا، والحديثه، وعمواس، ويالو؛ ومن نازحي عام 1967.\n\nالمستوطنات\nما ان اندلعت حرب 1967 والتي كانت نتائجها احتلال ما تبقى من ارض فلسطين - الضفه الغربيه وقطاع غزه، حتى سارعت اسرائيل في وضع الخطط بهدف اقامه العديد من المستوطنات. وكانت رام الله جزءا من هذا المخطط، حيث بنت اسرائيل في منطقه رام الله حوالي 27 مستوطنه وهي:\nمستوطنات تتوسط مجموعه من البلدات الفلسطينيه وهي: المديه، نعلين، دير قديس، حزما، عين حارث، بلعين، ام صفا وبيت سيرا:\n\nمكابيم اب\nكفار روث\nمستوطنه منوره\nشلتا نتتياهو\nحشمونائيم\nكريات سيفر\nوهناك مستوطنات تطوق مدينه رام الله وتسيطر على معظم اراضيها، وهي من الشرق:\n\nتلمون\nياد يائير\nبيت حورون\nجفعات زئيف\nبيت ايل\nبسجوت\nكوخاف يعقوب\nومن الجنوب:\n\nمستوطنه عطروت\nجفعون\nجفعات حداشا ا\nجبعات حدشاه ب\nاما التجمع الاستيطاني شمال شرق رام الله، فيضم مستوطنات: عوفرا، بيت ايل ا، بيت ايل بمعسكر (باعل حتسور)، الذي يطل على منطقه الاغوار الوسطى واريحا والبحر الميت، على ارتفاع 800 متر عن سطح البحر، وهو ذو اهميه استراتيجيه؛ نظراً لارتفاعه واشرافه على مساحات واسعه من مناطق وسط الضفه، ويبلغ عدد المستوطنين في ذلك التجمع نحو 5370 مستوطناً. ويشغل مساحه تبلغ اكثر من 2000 دونم.\n\nمدن متوامه\nالمدن الشقيقه لرام الله هي:\n\nالمراجع\nوصلات خارجيه\n\nموقع بلديه رام الله\nغرفه تجاره وصناعه محافظه رام
