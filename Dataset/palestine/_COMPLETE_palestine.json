          "content": "Jerusalem is a city in the Southern Levant, on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Both Israel and Palestine claim Jerusalem as their capital city; Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there, while Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power. Neither claim is widely recognised internationally.\nThroughout its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. During the Canaanite period (14th century BCE) Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning \"City of Shalem\" after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 10th century BCE (Iron Age II), and by the 9th century BCE the city had developed into the religious and administrative centre of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538 the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today those walls define the Old City, which since the 19th century has been divided into four quarters—the Armenian, Christian, Jewish and Muslim quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2023 Jerusalem had a population of 1,028,366. In 2022 60% were Jews and almost 40% were Palestinians. In 2020 the population was 951,100, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353,800 (37.2%), Christians 16,300 (1.7%) and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son King Solomon commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Israelites branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous—and later monotheistic—religion centred on El/Yahweh. These foundational events assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city (Hebrew: עיר הקודש, romanized: 'Ir ha-Qodesh) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians adopted as the Old Testament, was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection there. Meanwhile, in Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. The city was the first standard direction for Muslim prayers, and in Islamic tradition, Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he spoke to God, per the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (3⁄8 sq mi), the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nAt present, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, Jerusalem was to be \"established as a corpus separatum under a special international regime\" administered by the United Nations. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas incorporated into Israel, while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was occupied and annexed by Jordan. Israel occupied East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into the city's municipality, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residences of the prime minister and president, and the Supreme Court. The international community rejects the annexation as illegal and regards East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.\n\nEtymology and names\nEtymology\nThe name \"Jerusalem\" is variously etymologised to mean \"foundation (Semitic yry' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of the pagan god Shalem\"; the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city.\nShalim or Shalem was the name of the god of dusk in the Canaanite religion, whose name is based on the same root S-L-M from which the Hebrew word for \"peace\" is derived (Shalom in Hebrew, cognate with Arabic Salam). The name thus offered itself to etymologisations such as \"The City of Peace\", \"Abode of Peace\", \"Dwelling of Peace\" (\"founded in safety\"), or \"Vision of Peace\" in some Christian authors.\nThe ending -ayim indicates the dual, thus leading to the suggestion that the name Yerushalayim refers to the fact that the city initially sat on two hills.\n\nAncient Egyptian sources\nThe Execration Texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 19th century BCE), which refer to a city called rwšꜣlmm or ꜣwšꜣmm, variously transcribed as Rušalimum, or Urušalimum, may indicate Jerusalem. Alternatively, the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE), which reference an Úrušalim, may be the earliest mention of the city.\n\nHebrew Bible and Jewish sources\nThe form Yerushalem or Yerushalayim first appears in the Bible, in the Book of Joshua. According to a Midrash, the name is a combination of two names united by God, Yireh (\"the abiding place\", the name given by Abraham to the place where he planned to sacrifice his son) and Shalem (\"Place of Peace\", the name given by high priest Shem).\n\nOldest written mention of Jerusalem\nOne of the earliest extra-biblical Hebrew writing of the word Jerusalem is dated to the sixth or seventh century BCE and was discovered in Khirbet Beit Lei near Beit Guvrin in 1961. The inscription states: \"I am Yahweh thy God, I will accept the cities of Judah and I will redeem Jerusalem\", or as other scholars suggest: \"Yahweh is the God of the whole earth. The mountains of Judah belong to him, to the God of Jerusalem\". An earlier example of the name appears in a papyrus from the 7th century BCE.\n\nIn extra-biblical inscriptions, the earliest known example of the -ayim ending was discovered on a column about 3 km west of ancient Jerusalem, dated to the first century BCE.\n\nJebus, Zion, City of David\nAn ancient settlement of Jerusalem, founded as early as the Bronze Age on the hill above the Gihon Spring, was, according to the Bible, named Jebus. Called the \"Fortress of Zion\" (metsudat Zion), it was renamed as the \"City of David\", and was known by this name in antiquity. Another name, \"Zion\", initially referred to a distinct part of the city, but later came to signify the city as a whole, and afterwards to represent the whole biblical Land of Israel.\n\nGreek, Roman and Byzantine names\nIn Greek and Latin the city's name was transliterated Hierosolyma/Hierosoluma (Greek: Ἱεροσόλυμα; in Greek hieròs, ἱερός, means holy), and was the term used by Matthew and Mark in their gospels instead of the Hebrew term.\nUp until the 2010s the consensus among historians was that following Alexander the Great's conquest, Hierosoluma was set to be incorporated into the larger temple cities of the Seleucid kingdom, and to be Hellenised as Hierapolis. However, modern historians dispute this as a proper Ancient Greek translation for the polis would be similar to Hierolophos.\nAfter the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), the city was renamed Aelia Capitolina during the Roman period of its history. Named for the Roman emperor Hadrian and the deities of Rome, the name lasted until the Byzantine era.\n\nSalem\nThe Aramaic Apocryphon of Genesis of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1QapGen 22:13) equates Jerusalem with the earlier \"Salem\" (שלם), said to be the kingdom of Melchizedek in Genesis 14. Other early Hebrew sources, early Christian renderings of the verse and targumim, however, put Salem in Northern Israel near Shechem (Sichem), now Nablus, a city of some importance in early sacred Hebrew writing. Possibly the redactor of the Apocryphon of Genesis wanted to dissociate Melchizedek from the area of Shechem, which at the time was in possession of the Samaritans. However that may be, later Rabbinic sources also equate Salem with Jerusalem, mainly to link Melchizedek to later Temple traditions.\n\nArabic names\nOriginally titled Bayt al-Maqdis, today, Jerusalem is most commonly known in Arabic as القُدس, transliterated as al-Quds and meaning \"the holy\" or \"the holy sanctuary\", cognate with Hebrew: הקדש, romanized: ha-qodesh. The name is possibly a shortened form of مدينة القُدس Madīnat al-Quds \"city of the holy sanctuary\" after the Hebrew nickname with the same meaning, Ir ha-Qodesh (עיר הקדש). The ق (Q) is pronounced either with a voiceless uvular plosive (/q/), as in Classical Arabic, or with a glottal stop (ʔ) as in Levantine Arabic. Official Israeli government policy mandates that أُورُشَلِيمَ, transliterated as Ūrušalīm, which is the name frequently used in Christian translations of the Bible into Arabic, be used as the Arabic language name for the city in conjunction with القُدس, giving أُورُشَلِيمَ-القُدس, Ūrušalīm-al-Quds. Palestinian Arab families who hail from this city are often called \"Qudsi\" (قُدسي) or \"Maqdasi\" (مقدسي), while Palestinian Muslim Jerusalemites may use these terms as a demonym.\n\nHistory\nJerusalem is one of the world's oldest cities, with a history spanning over 5,000 years. Its origins trace back to around 3000 BCE, with the first settlement near the Gihon Spring. The city is first mentioned in Egyptian Execration texts around 2000 BCE as \"Rusalimum.\" By the 17th century BCE Jerusalem had developed into a fortified city under Canaanite rule, with massive walls protecting its water system. During the Late Bronze Age Jerusalem became a vassal of Ancient Egypt, as documented in the Amarna letters.\nThe city's importance grew during the Israelite period, which began around 1000 BCE when King David captured Jerusalem and made it the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel. David's son King Solomon built the First Temple, establishing the city as a major religious centre. Following the kingdom's split Jerusalem became the capital of the Kingdom of Judah until it was captured by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE. The Babylonians destroyed the First Temple, leading to the Babylonian exile of the Jewish population. After the Persian conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE, Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews to return and rebuild the city and its temple, marking the start of the Second Temple period. Jerusalem fell under Hellenistic rule after the conquests of Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, leading to increasing cultural and political influence from Greece. The Hasmonean revolt in 164 BCE briefly restored Jewish sovereignty, with Jerusalem as the capital of an independent state.\nIn 63 BCE Jerusalem was captured by Pompey and brought under the rule of the Roman Republic. The city was embellished by Herod the Great, who expanded the Second Temple, making it one of the largest sanctuaries in the ancient world. Tensions between the Jews and the Roman Empire eventually escalated into the First Jewish Revolt, resulting in the siege and destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70 CE. A few decades later, the city was rebuilt as the Roman colony Aelia Capitolina, dedicated to Jupiter, provoking the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–136 CE). After the revolt's suppression, Jews were banned from the city. During the Byzantine period, Jerusalem gained prominence as a centre of Christian pilgrimage, especially after Constantine the Great supported the construction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 638 CE, Jerusalem was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate, and under early Islamic rule, the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque were built, solidifying its religious importance in Islam.\nDuring the Crusades Jerusalem changed hands multiple times, being captured by the Crusaders in 1099 and recaptured by Saladin in 1187. It remained under Islamic control through the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, until it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517. In the modern period Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Israel captured East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967, uniting the city under Israeli control. The status of Jerusalem remains a highly contentious issue, with both Israelis and Palestinians claiming it as their capital. Historiographically, the city's history is often interpreted through the lens of competing national narratives. Israeli scholars emphasise the ancient Jewish connection to the city, while Palestinian narratives highlight the city's broader historical and multicultural significance. Both perspectives influence contemporary discussions of Jerusalem's status and future.\n\nPolitical status\nFrom 1923 until 1948 Jerusalem served as the administrative capital of Mandatory Palestine.\nFrom 1949 until 1967 West Jerusalem served as Israel's capital, but was not recognised as such internationally because UN General Assembly Resolution 194 envisaged Jerusalem as an international city. As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of Jerusalem came under Israeli control. On 27 June 1967, the government of Levi Eshkol extended Israeli law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, but agreed that administration of the Temple Mount compound would be maintained by the Jordanian waqf, under the Jordanian Ministry of Religious Endowments.\nIn 1988 the Israeli government ordered the closure of Orient House, home of the Arab Studies Society, but also the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization, for security reasons. The building reopened in 1992 as a Palestinian guesthouse. The Oslo Accords stated that the final status of Jerusalem would be determined by negotiations with the Palestinian Authority. The accords banned any official Palestinian presence in the city until a final peace agreement, but provided for the opening of a Palestinian trade office in East Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority regards East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas has said that any agreement that did not include East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine would be unacceptable. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has similarly stated that Jerusalem would remain the undivided capital of Israel. Due to its proximity to the city, especially the Temple Mount, Abu Dis, a Palestinian suburb of Jerusalem, has been proposed as the future capital of a Palestinian state by Israel. Israel has not incorporated Abu Dis within its security wall around Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority has built a possible future parliament building for the Palestinian Legislative Council in the town, and its Jerusalem Affairs Offices are all located in Abu Dis.\n\nInternational status\nWhile the international community regards East Jerusalem, including the entire Old City, as part of the occupied Palestinian territories, neither part, West or East Jerusalem, is recognised as part of the territory of Israel or the State of Palestine. Under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1947, Jerusalem was envisaged to become a corpus separatum administered by the United Nations. In the war of 1948 the western part of the city was occupied by forces of the nascent state of Israel, while the eastern part was occupied by Jordan. The international community largely considers the legal status of Jerusalem to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognise Israeli sovereignty over the city.\n\nStatus under Israeli rule\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel extended its jurisdiction and administration over East Jerusalem, establishing new municipal borders.\n\nIn 2010 Israel approved legislation giving Jerusalem the highest national priority status in Israel. The law prioritised construction throughout the city, and offered grants and tax benefits to residents to make housing, infrastructure, education, employment, business, tourism and cultural events more affordable. Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon said that the bill sent \"a clear, unequivocal political message that Jerusalem will not be divided\", and that \"all those within the Palestinian and international community who expect the current Israeli government to accept any demands regarding Israel's sovereignty over its capital are mistaken and misleading\".\nThe status of the city, and especially its holy places, remains a core issue in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The Israeli government has approved building plans in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City in order to expand the Jewish presence in East Jerusalem, while some Islamic leaders have made claims that Jews have no historical connection to Jerusalem, alleging that the 2,500-year-old Western Wall was constructed as part of a mosque. Palestinians regard Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine, and the city's borders have been the subject of bilateral talks. A team of experts assembled by the then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in 2000 concluded that the city must be divided, since Israel had failed to achieve any of its national aims there.\nHowever, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in 2014 that \"Jerusalem will never be divided\". A poll conducted in June 2013 found that 74% of Israeli Jews reject the idea of a Palestinian capital in any portion of Jerusalem, though 72% of the public regarded it as a divided city. A poll conducted by the Palestinian Centre for Public Opinion and American Pechter Middle East Polls for the Council on Foreign Relations among East Jerusalem Arab residents in 2011 revealed that 39% of East Jerusalem Arab residents would prefer Israeli citizenship, while 31% opted for Palestinian citizenship. According to the poll 40% of Palestinian residents would prefer to leave their neighbourhoods if they would be placed under Palestinian rule.\n\nJerusalem as capital of Israel\nOn 5 December 1949 Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, proclaimed Jerusalem as Israel's \"eternal\" and \"sacred\" capital, and eight days later specified that only the war had \"compelled\" the Israeli leadership \"to establish the seat of Government in Tel Aviv\", while \"for the State of Israel there has always been and always will be one capital only—Jerusalem the Eternal\", and that after the war, efforts had been ongoing for creating the conditions for \"the Knesset... returning to Jerusalem.\" This indeed took place, and since the beginning of 1950 all branches of the Israeli government—legislative, judicial and executive—have resided there, except for the Ministry of Defense, which is located at HaKirya in Tel Aviv. At the time of Ben Gurion's proclamations and the ensuing Knesset vote of 24 January 1950, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan, and thus the proclamation only applied to West Jerusalem.\nIn July 1980 Israel passed the Jerusalem Law as Basic Law. The law declared Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel. The Jerusalem Law was condemned by the international community, which did not recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 478 on 20 August 1980, which declared that the Jerusalem Law is \"a violation of international law\", is \"null and void and must be rescinded forthwith\". Member states were called upon to withdraw their diplomatic representation from Jerusalem.\nFollowing the resolution, 22 of the 24 countries that previously had their embassy in (West) Jerusalem relocated them in Tel Aviv, where many embassies already resided prior to Resolution 478. Costa Rica and El Salvador followed in 2006. There are five embassies—United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Papua New Guinea and Kosovo—and two consulates located within the city limits of Jerusalem. Paraguay maintains an embassy in the Jerusalem District town of Mevaseret Zion, in addition to Bolivia whose embassy is now closed. There are a number of consulates-general located in Jerusalem, which work primarily either with Israel, or the Palestinian authorities.\nIn 1995 the United States Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which required, subject to conditions, that its embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. On 6 December 2017 the US president, Donald Trump, officially recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and announced his intention to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, reversing decades of United States policy on the issue. The move was criticised by many nations. A resolution condemning the US decision was supported by all the 14 other members of the UN Security Council, but was vetoed by the US on 18 December 2017. A subsequent resolution condemning the US decision was passed in the United Nations General Assembly. On 14 May 2018 the United States officially opened its embassy in Jerusalem, transforming its Tel Aviv location into a consulate. Due to the general lack of international recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, some non-Israeli media outlets use Tel Aviv as a metonym for Israel.\nIn December 2017, US President Donald Trump made the decision to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to that city. This decision faced significant opposition, particularly from leaders within the Arab and Muslim communities. The Palestinians assert that East Jerusalem should serve as the capital of their future state, and its status ought to be resolved through peace negotiations as outlined in the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas remarked that Trump's action effectively negated the United States' position as a mediator in the peace process. Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Islamist Hamas movement, urged for a new \"intifada,\" or uprising. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized the decision, stating it would \"place the region in a ring of fire.\" Saudi Arabia's King Salman described it as \"a clear provocation to Muslims globally.\" Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi indicated that this decision would exacerbate the situation in the region. Iran warned that the decision would incite a \"new intifada,\" labeling it a blatant infringement of international resolutions.\nIn April 2017 the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced it viewed Western Jerusalem as Israel's capital in the context of UN-approved principles which include the status of East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian state. On 15 December 2018 the Australian government officially recognised West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but said their embassy in Tel Aviv would stay until a two-state resolution was settled. The decision was reversed in October 2022.\n\nGovernment precinct and national institutions\nThe Kiryat HaLeom (national precinct) project is intended to house most government agencies and national cultural institutions. They are located in the Kiryat HaMemshala (government complex) in the Givat Ram neighbourhood. Some government buildings are located in Kiryat Menachem Begin. The city is home to the Knesset, the Supreme Court, the Bank of Israel, the National Headquarters of the Israel Police, the official residences of the president and the prime minister, the Cabinet, and all ministries except for the Ministry of Defense (which is located in central Tel Aviv's HaKirya district) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (which is located in Rishon LeZion, in the wider Tel Aviv metropolitan area, near Beit Dagan).\n\nIsraeli settlements\nSince its capture in 1967, the Israeli government has built 12 Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, with a population amounting to 220,000 Israeli Jewish settlers as of 2019. The international community consider Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law.\n\nJerusalem as capital of Palestine\nThe Palestinian National Authority views East Jerusalem as occupied territory according to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. The Palestinian Authority claims Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharif, as the capital of the State of Palestine, The PLO claims that West Jerusalem is also subject to permanent status negotiations. However, it has stated that it would be willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making Jerusalem an open city.\nThe PLO's position is that East Jerusalem, as defined by the pre-1967 municipal boundaries, shall be the capital of Palestine and West Jerusalem the capital of Israel, with each state enjoying full sovereignty over its respective part of the city and with its own municipality. A joint development council would be responsible for coordinated development. Orient House in East Jerusalem served as the headquarters of the PLO in the 1980s and 1990s. It was closed by Israel in 2001, two days after the Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing.\nSome states, such as Russia and China, recognise the Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 58/292 affirmed that the Palestinian people have the right to sovereignty over East Jerusalem.\n\nPalestinian offices and institutions\nGovernment offices are located outside the Israeli municipal limits include the Palestinian Security Services, Force 17, the Preventative Security Service and the Ministry of Interior. There is a Palestinian Authority regional office and an electoral office located in the Dahiyat al Barid neighbourhood.\n\nMunicipal administration\nThe Jerusalem City Council is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies. The former mayor of Jerusalem, Uri Lupolianski, was elected in 2003. In the November 2008 city elections, Nir Barkat was elected. In November 2018 Moshe Lion was elected mayor.\nApart from the mayor and his deputies, City Council members receive no salaries and work on a voluntary basis. The longest-serving Jerusalem mayor is Teddy Kollek, who spent 28 years—six consecutive terms—in office. Most of the meetings of the Jerusalem City Council are private, but each month, it holds a session that is open to the public. Within the city council, religious political parties form an especially powerful faction, accounting for the majority of its seats.\nThe headquarters of the Jerusalem Municipality and the mayor's office are at Safra Square (Kikar Safra) on Jaffa Road. The municipal complex, comprising two modern buildings and ten renovated historic buildings surrounding a large plaza, opened in 1993 when it moved from the old town hall building built by the Mandate authorities. The city falls under the Jerusalem District, with Jerusalem as the district's capital. 37% of the population is Palestinian, but in 2014 not more than 10% of tax revenues were allocated for them. In East Jerusalem, 52% of the land was excluded from development, 35% designated for Jewish settlements, and 13% for Palestinian use, almost all of which was already built upon.\nIn the Oslo I Accord, certain parts of few neighbourhoods were allotted to the Palestinian Authority. Parts of Sur Baher, Wadi al-Hummus, Umm Leisun and Umm Tuba, altogether came under Area A, which is completely controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Al-Ram and Dahiyat al-Barid are mostly in Area B, where both Palestine and Israel has control. Other parts of Beit Hanina, Kafr Aqab and Arab al-Jahalin also falls under Area B.\n\nGeography\nJerusalem is situated on the southern spur of a plateau in the Judaean Mountains, which include the Mount of Olives (East) and Mount Scopus (North East). The elevation of the Old City is approximately 760 m (2,490 ft). The whole of Jerusalem is surrounded by valleys and dry riverbeds (wadis). The Kidron, Hinnom, and Tyropoeon Valleys intersect in an area just south of the Old City of Jerusalem. The Kidron Valley runs to the east of the Old City and separates the Mount of Olives from the city proper. Along the southern side of old Jerusalem is the Valley of Hinnom, a steep ravine associated in biblical eschatology with the concept of Gehenna or Hell.\nThe Tyropoeon Valley commenced in the northwest near the Damascus Gate, ran south-southeasterly through the centre of the Old City down to the Pool of Siloam, and divided the lower part into two hills, the Temple Mount to the east, and the rest of the city to the west, the lower and the upper cities described by Josephus. Today, this valley is hidden by debris that has accumulated over the centuries. In biblical times Jerusalem was surrounded by forests of almond, olive and pine trees. These were destroyed by centuries of warfare and neglect. Farmers in the Jerusalem region built stone terraces along the slopes to hold back the soil, a feature still very much in evidence in the Jerusalem landscape.\nWater supply has always been a major problem in Jerusalem, as attested to by the intricate network of ancient aqueducts, tunnels, pools and cisterns found in the city.\nJerusalem is 60 km (37 mi) east of Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean Sea. On the opposite side of the city, approximately 35 km (22 mi) away, is the Dead Sea, the lowest body of water on Earth. Neighbouring cities and towns include Bethlehem and Beit Jala to the south, Abu Dis and Ma'ale Adumim to the east, Mevaseret Zion to the west, and Ramallah and Giv'at Ze'ev to the north.\nMount Herzl, at the western side of the city near the Jerusalem Forest, serves as the national cemetery of Israel.\n\nClimate\nThe city is characterised by a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa), with hot, dry summers, and mild, wet winters. Snow flurries usually occur once or twice a winter, although the city experiences heavy snowfall every three to four years, on average, with short-lived accumulation.\nJanuary is the coldest month of the year, with an average temperature of 9.1 °C (48.4 °F); July and August are the hottest months, with an average temperature of 24.2 °C (75.6 °F), and the summer months are usually rainless. The average annual precipitation is around 537 mm (21 in), with rain occurring almost entirely between October and May. Snowfall is rare, and large snowfalls are even more rare. Jerusalem received over 30 cm (12 in) of snow on 13 December 2013, which nearly paralysed the city. A day in Jerusalem has on average, 9.3 sunshine hours. With summers averaging similar temperatures as the coastline, the maritime influence from the Mediterranean Sea is strong, in particular given that Jerusalem is located on a similar latitude as scorching hot deserts not far to its east.\nThe highest recorded temperature in Jerusalem was 44.4 °C (111.9 °F) on 28 and 30 August 1881, and the lowest temperature recorded was −6.7 °C (19.9 °F) on 25 January 1907.\nMost of the air pollution in Jerusalem comes from vehicular traffic. Many main streets in Jerusalem were not built to accommodate such a large volume of traffic, leading to traffic congestion and more carbon monoxide released into the air. Industrial pollution inside the city is sparse, but emissions from factories on the Israeli Mediterranean coast can travel eastward and settle over the city.\n\nDemographics\nDemographic history\nJerusalem's population size and composition have shifted many times over its 5,000-year history. Since the 19th century, the Old City of Jerusalem has been divided into Jewish, Muslim, Christian and Armenian quarters. Matthew Teller writes that this convention may have originated in the 1841 British Royal Engineers map of Jerusalem, or at least the Rev. George Williams' subsequent labelling of it.\nMost population data before 1905 are based on estimates, often from foreign travellers or organisations, since previous census data usually covered wider areas such as the Jerusalem District. These estimates suggest that since the end of the Crusades, Muslims formed the largest group in Jerusalem until the mid-nineteenth century.\nBetween 1838 and 1876 a number of estimates exist which conflict as to whether Jews or Muslims were the largest group during this period, and between 1882 and 1922 estimates conflict as to exactly when Jews became an absolute majority of the population.\n\nCurrent demographics\nIn December 2007 Jerusalem had a population of 747,600—63.7% were Jewish, 33.1% Muslim, and 2% Christian.\nAccording to a study published in 2000, the percentage of Jews in the city's population had been decreasing; this was attributed to a higher Muslim birth rate, and Jewish residents leaving. The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City's 32,488 people were Jews. Of the Jewish population, 200,000 live in East Jerusalem settlements which are considered illegal under international law.\nIn 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the United States, France and the former Soviet Union. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in. Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high birth rate, especially in the Haredi Jewish and Arab communities. Consequently, the total fertility rate in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem's 180,000 households is 3.8 people.\nIn 2005 the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%)—similar to the Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is 42%.\nIn 1967 Jews accounted for 74% of the population, while the figure for 2006 is down by 9%. Possible factors are the high cost of housing, fewer job opportunities and the increasingly religious character of the city, although proportionally, young Haredim are leaving in higher numbers. The percentage of secular Jews, or those who 'wear their faith lightly' is dropping, with some 20,000 leaving the city over the past seven years (2012). They now number 31% of the population, the same percentage as the rising Haredi population.\nIn 2010, 61% of all Jewish children in Jerusalem studied in Haredi (Ultra-Orthodox) schools. This correlates with the high number of children in Haredi families.\nWhile some secular Jews leave Jerusalem for its relative lack of development and religious and political tensions, Jerusalem-born Palestinians cannot leave Jerusalem, or they lose their right to live in the city. Palestinians with a \"Jerusalem resident status\" are entitled to the subsidised healthcare and social security benefits Israel provides to its citizens, and have the right to vote in municipal elections, but not to be voted in municipal elections, or to vote in national elections. Arabs in Jerusalem can send their children to Israeli-run schools, although not every neighbourhood has one, and universities. Israeli doctors and highly regarded hospitals such as Hadassah Medical Centre are available to residents.\nDemographics and the Jewish-Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jerusalem. In 1998, the Jerusalem Development Authority expanded city limits to the west to include more areas heavily populated with Jews.\n\nWithin the past few years, there has been a steady increase in the Jewish birthrate and a steady decrease in the Arab birthrate. In May 2012 it was reported that the Jewish birthrate had overtaken the Arab birthrate. The city's birthrate stands about 4.2 children per Jewish family and 3.9 children per Arab family. In addition, increasing numbers of Jewish immigrants chose to settle in Jerusalem. In the last few years, thousands of Palestinians have moved to previously fully Jewish neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem, built after the 1967 Six-Day War. In 2007, 1,300 Palestinians lived in the previously exclusively Jewish neighbourhood of Pisgat Ze'ev and constituted 3% of the population in Neve Ya'akov. In the French Hill neighbourhood Palestinians today constitute one-sixth of the overall population.At the end of 2008 the population of East Jerusalem was 456,300, comprising 60% of Jerusalem's residents. Of these 195,500 (43%) were Jews, (comprising 40% of the Jewish population of Jerusalem as a whole), and 260,800 (57%) were Muslim (comprising 98% of the Muslim population of Jerusalem). In 2008 the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported the number of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem was 208,000 according to a recently completed census.\nJerusalem's Jewish population is overwhelmingly religious. Only 18% of Jewish residents are secular. In addition, Haredi Jews comprise 35% of the city's adult Jewish population. In a phenomenon seen rarely around the world, the percentage of Jewish women who work, 81%, exceeds the percentage of Jewish men who work, 70%.\nJerusalem had a population of 804,400 in 2011, of which Jews comprised 499,400 (62.1%), Muslims 281,100 (34.9%), Christians 14,700 (1.8%), and 9,000 (1.1%) were not classified by religion.\nJerusalem had a population of 882,700 in 2016, of which Jews comprised 536,600 (60.8%), Muslims 319,800 (36.2%), Christians 15,800 (1.8%), and 10,300 unclassified (1.2%).\nJerusalem had a population of 951,100 in 2020, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353.800 (37.2%), Christians 16.300 (1.7%), and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\n\nAccording to Peace Now, approvals for building in Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem expanded by 60% under Donald Trump's first US presidency. Since 1991, Palestinians, who make up the majority of the residents in East Jerusalem, have only received 30% of the building permits.\n\nUrban planning issues\nCritics of efforts to promote a Jewish majority in Jerusalem say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction. According to a World Bank report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighbourhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West Jerusalem than in East Jerusalem; Arabs in Jerusalem were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and \"the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators\" than Jewish violators of the permit process. In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the City of David archaeological site in the 60% Arab neighbourhood of Silwan (adjacent to the Old City), and the Museum of Tolerance on Mamilla Cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square).\n\nReligious significance\nJerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city. Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy. The Temple Mount is the holiest spot in Judaism and the third holiest site in Islam. Jews venerate it as the site of the two former Temples and Muslims believe that Muhammad was transported from the Great Mosque of Mecca to this location during the Night Journey.\n\nJudaism\nJerusalem has been the holiest city in Judaism and the ancestral and spiritual homeland of the Jewish people since King David proclaimed it his capital in the 10th century BCE. Without counting its other names, Jerusalem appears in the Hebrew Bible 669 times. The first five books of the Torah (Pentateuch), only mentions Moriah, but in the rest of the Bible, the city is mentioned explicitly. The Temple Mount, which was the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Temple, is the holiest site in Judaism and the place Jews throughout the world turn towards during prayer. The Western Wall, a remnant of the wall surrounding the Second Temple, attracts over 10 million visitors each year. Synagogues around the world are traditionally built with the Holy Ark facing Jerusalem, and Arks within Jerusalem face the Holy of Holies. As prescribed in the Mishna and codified in the Shulchan Aruch, daily prayers are recited while facing towards Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Many Jews have \"Mizrach\" plaques hung on a wall of their homes to indicate the direction of prayer. Many parts of Jewish liturgy mention Jerusalem, including at the conclusion of the Passover Seder when participants declare \"Next Year in Jerusalem!\" The fourteenth blessing of the Amidah prayer, said three times per day is a request that the Jerusalem be rebuilt, as well as the \"Shechinah\" be returned to Zion. The \"Grace After Meals\" which is said after eating a meal including bread, has multiple references to Jerusalem. The entire fast day of Tisha B'Av is dedicated to remembering and mourning the destruction of the first and second temples in Jerusalem.\n\nChristianity\nJerusalem is generally considered the cradle of Christianity. Christianity reveres Jerusalem for its Old Testament history, and also for its significance in the life of Jesus. According to the New Testament, Jesus was brought to Jerusalem soon after his birth and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple. The Cenacle, believed to be the site of Jesus' Last Supper, is located on Mount Zion in the same building that houses the Tomb of King David. Another prominent Christian site in Jerusalem is Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion. The Gospel of John describes it as being located outside Jerusalem, but recent archaeological evidence suggests Golgotha is a short distance from the Old City walls, within the present-day confines of the city. The land occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is considered one of the top candidates for Golgotha and thus has been a Christian pilgrimage site for the past 2000 years. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is generally considered the most important church in Christendom. It contains the two holiest sites in Christianity: the site where Jesus was crucified, and Jesus's empty tomb, where he is believed by Christians to have been buried and resurrected.\n\nIslam\nJerusalem is the third-holiest city in Sunni Islam. Islamic tradition holds that for approximately a year, before it was permanently switched to the Kaaba in Mecca, the qibla (direction of prayer) for Muslims was Jerusalem. The city's lasting place in Islam, however, is primarily due to Muhammad's Night Journey (c. 620 CE). Muslims believe that Muhammad was miraculously transported one night from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, whereupon he ascended to Heaven to meet previous prophets of Islam. The first verse in the Qur'an's Surat al-Isra notes the destination of Muhammad's journey as al-masjid al-aqṣā (\"the farthest place of prayer\"). In the earliest days of Islam, this was understood as a reference to a site in the heavens, however, Post-Rashidun Islamic scholars understood it as relating to Jerusalem, and particularly to the site of the former Jewish Temple. The hadith, a collection of the sayings of Muhammad, mentions that the location of the Al-Aqsa Mosque is in Jerusalem. The Al-Aqsa Mosque, originally named after the wider compound it sits within, was built on the Temple Mount under the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid several decades after Muhammad's death to commemorate the place from which Muslims believe he had ascended to Heaven.\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, Jerusalem's economy was supported almost exclusively by religious pilgrims, as it was far from the major ports of Jaffa and Gaza. Jerusalem's religious and cultural landmarks today remain the top draw for foreign visitors, with the majority of tourists visiting the Western Wall and the Old City. In 2010, Jerusalem was named the top leisure travel city in Africa and the Middle East by Travel + Leisure magazine. In 2013, 75% of the 3.5 million tourists to Israel visited Jerusalem.\n\nSince the establishment of the State of Israel, the national government has remained a major player in Jerusalem's economy. The government, centred in Jerusalem, generates a large number of jobs, and offers subsidies and incentives for new business initiatives and start-ups. Although Tel Aviv remains Israel's financial centre, a growing number of high tech companies are moving to Jerusalem, providing 12,000 jobs in 2006. Northern Jerusalem's Har Hotzvim industrial park and the Jerusalem Technology Park in south Jerusalem are home to large Research and Development centres of international tech companies, among them Intel, Cisco Systems, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, IBM, Mobileye, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and more. In April 2015 Time magazine picked Jerusalem as one of the five emerging tech hubs in the world, proclaiming that \"The city has become a flourishing centre for biomed, cleantech, Internet/mobile startups, accelerators, investors and supporting service providers.\"\n\nHigher than average percentages are employed in education (17.9% vs. 12.7%); health and welfare (12.6% vs. 10.7%); community and social services (6.4% vs. 4.7%); hotels and restaurants (6.1% vs. 4.7%); and public administration (8.2% vs. 4.7%). During the British Mandate, a law was passed requiring all buildings to be constructed of Jerusalem stone in order to preserve the unique historic and aesthetic character of the city. Complementing this building code, which is still in force, is the discouragement of heavy industry in Jerusalem; only about 2.2% of Jerusalem's land is zoned for \"industry and infrastructure\". By comparison, the percentage of land in Tel Aviv zoned for industry and infrastructure is twice as high, and in Haifa, seven times as high. Only 8.5% of the Jerusalem District work force is employed in the manufacturing sector, which is half the national average (15.8%).\nAlthough many statistics indicate economic growth in the city, since 1967, East Jerusalem has lagged behind the development of West Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the percentage of households with employed persons is higher for Arab households (76.1%) than for Jewish households (66.8%). The unemployment rate in Jerusalem (8.3%) is slightly better than the national average (9.0%), although the civilian labour force accounted for less than half of all persons fifteen years or older—lower in comparison to that of Tel Aviv (58.0%) and Haifa (52.4%). Poverty remains a problem in the city as 37% of the families in Jerusalem lived in 2011 below the poverty line. According to a report by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), 78% of Arabs in Jerusalem lived in poverty in 2012, up from 64% in 2006. While the ACRI attributes the increase to the lack of employment opportunities, infrastructure and a worsening educational system, the activist group Ir Amim blames the legal status of Palestinians in Jerusalem.\nThe increasing number of educated Palestinians in Jerusalem has brought about positive economic changes. Through reforms and initiatives in sectors like technology, tourism, trade, and infrastructure, they have helped drive economic growth, create jobs, and improve living conditions in the city. Various joint summits between Israeli and Palestinian entrepreneurs have been held in the city. Palestine Investment Fund have proposed various projects in Jerusalem. Palestinian industrialist Bashar Masri sought to make heavy investments in the city. PA controlled industrial areas are located outskirts of Jerusalem, primarily in Bir Nabala, Abu Dis and Eizariya, engaging in manufacture of tires, food products and concretes.\nHigh-tech industry is emerged among Palestinian society of Jerusalem. In 2023 Israel opened a technology park in East Jerusalem, known as EasTech. Local Palestinian engineers are employed in the complex by multinational companies, some of which includes AT&T, Natural Intelligence, Nvidia, Unity and Synamedia. Station J, an innovation hub is located in Sheikh Jarrah, which is yet another tech hub for Palestinians in the city. Hani Alami, a Jerusalem-based Palestinian entrepreneur has set up a start-+up accelerator. As a part of Israeli–Palestinian economic peace efforts, interaction between Israeli and Palestinian business community, also contributes in growth of Palestinian IT sector in the city.\n\nUrban structure\nHigh-rise construction\nJerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline. About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter. One of them, Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem's tallest building, is a skyscraper by international standards, rising 32 stories. Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height.\n\nA new master plan for the city will see many high-rise buildings, including skyscrapers, built in certain, designated areas of downtown Jerusalem. Under the plan, towers will line Jaffa Road and King George Street. One of the proposed towers along King George Street, the Migdal Merkaz HaYekum, is planned as a 65-story building, which would make it one of the tallest buildings in Israel. At the entrance to the city, near the Jerusalem Chords Bridge and the Central Bus Station, twelve towers rising between 24 and 33 stories will be built, as part of a complex that will also include an open square and an underground train station serving a new express line between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and will be connected by bridges and tunnels. Eleven of the skyscrapers will be either office or apartment buildings, and one will be a 2,000-room hotel. The complex is expected to attract many businesses from Tel Aviv, and become the city's main business hub. In addition, a complex for the city's courts and the prosecutor's office will be built, as well as new buildings for Central Zionist Archives and Israel State Archives. The skyscrapers built throughout the city are expected to contain public space, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, and it has been speculated that this may lead to a revitalization of downtown Jerusalem. In August 2015, the city council approved construction of a 344-foot pyramid-shaped skyscraper designed by Daniel Libeskind and Yigal Levi, in place of a rejected previous design by Libeskind; it was set to break ground by 2019.\n\nNew projects in Jerusalem\nIn 2021 Bashar Masri announced and launched \"Lana\", a massive mix-used project in East Jerusalem, which is located in the neighbourhood of Beit Hanina. The project is in a partnership between Massar International and the Orthodox Church of Jerusalem. It features 400 residential apartments along with a vibrant commercial centre that hosts well-known global brands, cinemas, restaurants, cafés and offices. The project also includes modern educational facilities, such as a school and a kindergarten, catering to the needs of residents. In addition to its focus on residential and commercial aspects, the Lana project emphasises the improvement of infrastructure within the project and its surroundings. This involves the construction of three to four floors of underground parking to accommodate the residents' vehicles conveniently. Furthermore, there is a comprehensive plan to expand the road network surrounding the project, ensuring smooth transportation and accessibility for both residents and visitors. It is situated just 15 minutes away from the historic Old City of Jerusalem.\n\nTransportation\nPublic transport\nJerusalem is served by highly developed communication infrastructures, making it a leading logistics hub for Israel.\nThe Jerusalem Central Bus Station, located on Jaffa Road, is the busiest bus station in Israel. It is served by Egged Bus Cooperative, which is the second-largest bus company in the world, The Dan serves the Bnei Brak-Jerusalem route along with Egged, and Superbus serves the routes between Jerusalem, Modi'in Illit and Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut. The companies operate from Jerusalem Central Bus Station. Arab neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem and routes between Jerusalem and locations in the West Bank are served by the East Jerusalem Central Bus Station, a transportation hub located near the Old City's Damascus Gate.\n\nRailway\nThe Jerusalem Light Rail initiated service in August 2011. According to plans, the first rail line will be capable of transporting an estimated 200,000 people daily, and has 23 stops. The route is from Pisgat Ze'ev in the north via the Old City and city centre to Mt. Herzl in the south.\n\nA high-speed rail line connecting Tel Aviv to Jerusalem became partially operational in 2018 and was completed in 2019. Its terminus is at the new underground station (80 m or 262 ft deep) serving the International Convention Centre and the Central Bus Station, and is planned to be extended eventually to Malha station. Israel Railways operated train services to Malha train station from Tel Aviv via Beit Shemesh, but this service was discontinued in 2020.\nBegin Expressway is one of Jerusalem's major north–south thoroughfares; it runs on the western side of the city, merging in the north with Route 443, which continues toward Tel Aviv. Route 60 runs through the centre of the city near the Green Line between East and West Jerusalem. Construction is progressing on parts of a 35 km (22 mi) ring road around the city, fostering faster connection between the suburbs. The eastern half of the project was conceptualised decades ago, but reaction to the proposed highway is still mixed.\n\nAirport\nIn the past, Jerusalem was also served by the local Jerusalem International Airport, locally known as Atarot Airport. It was the first airport built in the British Mandate of Palestine. Palestinians considered the Atarot Airport as a \"symbol of Palestinian sovereignty\". The airport falls beyond Green Line. After the 1948 war it came under control of Jordan. Following the Six Day War of 1967, the airport came under control of Israel. With increase of violence in the second intifada, Atarot Airport ceased operation in 2000. Today Jerusalem is served by Ben Gurion Airport, some 50 km (30 mi) northwest of the Jerusalem, on the route to Tel Aviv. The Tel Aviv–Jerusalem railway runs non-stop from Jerusalem–Yitzhak Navon railway station to the airport and began operation in 2018.\nThe Australian businessman Kevin Bermeister proposed a masterplan of Jerusalem, which also includes the development of an airport for Jerusalem in the Jordan Valley, near Jericho. The airport is sought to be a joint Israeli-Palestinian airport. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh have also appealed to Israeli authorities to redevelop the airport. In 2021, the Israeli government planned to redevelop Atarot Airport as a joint Israeli–Palestinian airport. The new Atarot Airport will include two separate Israeli and Palestinian terminals.\n\nEducation\nUniversities\nJerusalem is home to several prestigious universities offering courses in Hebrew, Arabic and English.\n\nFounded in 1925, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has been ranked among the top 100 schools in the world. The Board of Governors has included such prominent Jewish intellectuals as Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. The university has produced several Nobel laureates; recent winners associated with Hebrew University include Avram Hershko, David Gross, and Daniel Kahneman. One of the university's major assets is the Jewish National and University Library, which houses over five million books. The library opened in 1892, over three decades before the university was established, and is one of the world's largest repositories of books on Jewish subjects. Today it is both the central library of the university and the national library of Israel. The Hebrew University operates three campuses in Jerusalem, on Mount Scopus, on Giv'at Ram and a medical campus at the Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital. The Academy of the Hebrew Language are located in the Hebrew university in Givat Ram and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities located near the Presidents House.\nThe Jerusalem College of Technology, founded in 1969, combines training in engineering and other high-tech industries with a Jewish studies programme. It is one of many schools in Jerusalem, from elementary school and up, that combine secular and religious studies. Numerous religious educational institutions and Yeshivot, including some of the most prestigious yeshivas, among them the Brisk, Chevron, Midrash Shmuel and Mir, are based in the city, with the Mir Yeshiva claiming to be the largest. There were nearly 8,000 twelfth-grade students in Hebrew-language schools during the 2003–2004 school year. However, due to the large portion of students in Haredi Jewish frameworks, only fifty-five percent of twelfth graders took matriculation exams (Bagrut) and only thirty-seven percent were eligible to graduate. Unlike public schools, many Haredi schools do not prepare students to take standardised tests. To attract more university students to Jerusalem, the city has begun to offer a special package of financial incentives and housing subsidies to students who rent apartments in downtown Jerusalem.\n\nAl-Quds University was established in 1984 to serve as a flagship university for the Arab and Palestinian peoples. It describes itself as the \"only Arab university in Jerusalem\". Bard College of Annandale-on-Hudson, New York and Al-Quds University agreed to open a joint college in a building originally built to house the Palestinian Legislative Council and Yasser Arafat's office. The college gives Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. Al-Quds University resides southeast of the city proper on a 190,000 m2 (47-acre) Abu Dis campus. Other campuses of AQU are located within city limits of Jerusalem. A campus of university in Sheikh Jarrah, which is one of the oldest faculties, is known as Hind Al Husseini College for Arts. It was named after Hind al-Husseini, a Palestinian activists known for rescuing orphaned survivors of Deir Yassin massacre and giving them shelter in a palace of her grandfather, which was converted into an orphanage and later a college, which is a part today's Al Quds University. A joint campus of AQU and Bard College is located in Beit Hanina. Bayt Mal Al Qods Acharif Agency, a Moroccan organisation, is constructing a new campus in the same neighbourhood.\nOther institutions of higher learning in Jerusalem are the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance and Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, whose buildings are located on the campuses of the Hebrew University.\n\nArab schools\nIsrael's public schools for Arabs in Jerusalem and other parts of the country have been criticised for offering a lower quality education than those catering to Israeli Jewish students. While many schools in the heavily Arab East Jerusalem are filled to capacity and there have been complaints of overcrowding, the Jerusalem Municipality is building over a dozen new schools in the city's Arab neighbourhoods. Schools in Ras el-Amud and Umm Lison opened in 2008. In March 2007 the Israeli government approved a five-year plan to build 8,000 new classrooms in the city, 40 percent in the Arab sector and 28 percent in the Haredi sector. A budget of 4.6 billion shekels was allocated for this project. In 2008, Jewish British philanthropists donated $3 million for the construction of schools for Arabs in East Jerusalem. Arab high school students take the Bagrut matriculation exams, so that much of their curriculum parallels that of other Israeli high schools and includes certain Jewish subjects.\n\nCulture\nAlthough Jerusalem is known primarily for its religious significance, the city is also home to many artistic and cultural venues. The Israel Museum attracts nearly one million visitors a year, approximately one-third of them tourists. The 8 ha (20-acre) museum complex comprises several buildings featuring special exhibits and extensive collections of Judaica, archaeological findings, and Israeli and European art. The Dead Sea scrolls, discovered in the mid-20th century in the Qumran Caves near the Dead Sea, are housed in the Museum's Shrine of the Book. The Youth Wing, which mounts changing exhibits and runs an extensive art education programme, is visited by 100,000 children a year. The museum has a large outdoor sculpture garden and includes the Holyland Model of Jerusalem, a scale-model of the city during the late Second Temple period. The Ticho House in downtown Jerusalem houses the paintings of Anna Ticho and the Judaica collections of her husband, an ophthalmologist who opened Jerusalem's first eye clinic in this building in 1912.\n\nNext to the Israel Museum is the Bible Lands Museum, near The National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel, which includes the Israel Antiquities Authority offices. A World Bible Centre is planned to be built adjacent to Mount Zion at a site called the \"Bible Hill\". A planned World Kabbalah Centre is to be located on the nearby promenade, overlooking the Old City. The Rockefeller Museum, located in East Jerusalem, was the first archaeological museum in the Middle East. It was built in 1938 during the British Mandate. In 2006, a 38 km (24 mi) Jerusalem Trail was opened, a hiking trail that goes to many cultural sites and national parks in and around Jerusalem. The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo has ranked consistently as Israel's top tourist attraction for Israelis. The national cemetery of Israel is located at the city's western edge, near the Jerusalem Forest on Mount Herzl. The western extension of Mount Herzl is the Mount of Remembrance, where the main Holocaust museum of Israel is located. Yad Vashem, Israel's national memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, houses the world's largest library of Holocaust-related information. It houses an estimated 100,000 books and articles. The complex contains a state-of-the-art museum that explores the genocide of the Jews through exhibits that focus on the personal stories of individuals and families killed in the Holocaust. An art gallery featuring the work of artists who perished is also present. Further, Yad Vashem commemorates the 1.5 million Jewish children murdered by the Nazis, and honours the Righteous among the Nations.\n\nThe Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, established in the 1940s, has appeared around the world. The International Convention Centre (Binyanei HaUma) near the entrance to city houses the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. The Jerusalem Cinemateque, the Gerard Behar Centre (formerly Beit Ha'Am) in downtown Jerusalem, the Jerusalem Music Centre in Yemin Moshe, and the Targ Music Centre in Ein Kerem also present the arts. The Israel Festival, featuring indoor and outdoor performances by local and international singers, concerts, plays, and street theatre has been held annually since 1961, and Jerusalem has been the major organiser of this event. The Jerusalem Theatre in the Talbiya neighbourhood hosts over 150 concerts a year, as well as theatre and dance companies and performing artists from overseas. The Khan Theatre, located in a caravanserai opposite the old Jerusalem train station, is the city's only repertoire theatre. The station itself has become a venue for cultural events in recent years as the site of Shav'ua Hasefer (an annual week-long book fair) and outdoor music performances. The Jerusalem Film Festival is held annually, screening Israeli and international films. In 1974 the Jerusalem Cinematheque was founded. In 1981 it was moved to a new building on Hebron Road near the Valley of Hinnom and the Old City.\nJerusalem was declared the Capital of Arab Culture in 2009. Jerusalem is home to the Palestinian National Theatre, which engages in cultural preservation as well as innovation, working to rekindle Palestinian interest in the arts. The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music sponsors the Palestine Youth Orchestra which toured Arab states of the Persian Gulf and other Middle East countries in 2009. The Islamic Museum on the Temple Mount, established in 1923, houses many Islamic artefacts, from tiny kohl flasks and rare manuscripts to giant marble columns. Al-Hoash, established in 2004, is a gallery for the preservation of Palestinian art. While Israel approves and financially supports some Arab cultural activities, Arab Capital of Culture events were banned because they were sponsored by the Palestine National Authority. In 2009 a four-day culture festival was held in the Beit 'Anan suburb of Jerusalem, attended by more than 15,000 people\nPalestinian cinema is based in the city. Jerusalem has been location for \"Jerusalem Arab Film Festival\", for exhibiting Palestinian films. The city is home to numerous artists, singers, actors, actresses and filmmakers. Established in 1991, Riwaq have been working on various projects to restore cultural and historical sites across Palestine. Difficulties to operate in the annexed areas of Palestinian Jerusalem, it have successfully worked across those neighbourhoods, rural and suburban area and Jerusalem Mountains (Jibal al-Quds), where the Palestinian government has control. So far, the organisation have restored a number of sites across the neighbourhoods of Kafr 'Aqab, Al Jib, Jaba and Qalandia. Those restored structures serves as local community centres, cultural sites and headquarters of several NGOs and cultural groups. Yabous Cultural Center is the largest cultural centre in the city, opened by Palestinian groups in 1997. Edward Said National Conservatory of Music have a branch in Jerusalem.\nHadassah Medical Center and the Hebrew University have unveiled a \"Tree of Peace\" statue at the Al Quds University School of Dental Medicine. The Museum on the Seam, which explores issues of coexistence through art, is situated on the road dividing eastern and western Jerusalem. The Abraham Fund and the Jerusalem Intercultural Centre (JICC) promote joint Jewish-Palestinian cultural projects. The Jerusalem Centre for Middle Eastern Music and Dance is open to Arabs and Jews and offers workshops on Jewish-Arab dialogue through the arts. The Jewish-Arab Youth Orchestra performs both European classical and Middle Eastern music. In 2008 the Tolerance Monument, an outdoor sculpture by Czesław Dźwigaj, was erected on a hill between Jewish Armon HaNetziv and Arab Jebl Mukaber as a symbol of Jerusalem's quest for peace.\n\nMedia\nThe headquarters of the Israel Broadcasting Authority and its successor Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation are located in Jerusalem, as well as television and radio studios for Channel 12, Channel 13, and part of the radio studios of BBC News. The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel are also headquartered in Jerusalem. Local newspapers include the Israeli Kol Ha'ir and the Palestinian Jerusalem Times. God TV, an international Christian television network, is also based in the city. PYALARA, an organisation based in Jerusalem, transformed Jaba into a digital hub, which is the Middle East's first digital village and is also home to the first Media Interactive Learning Center in the Middle East.\n\nSports\nThe two most popular sports are football (soccer) and basketball. Beitar Jerusalem Football Club is one of the most well known in Israel. Fans include political figures who often attend its games. Jerusalem's other major football team, and one of Beitar's top rivals, is Hapoel Jerusalem F.C. Whereas Beitar has been Israel State Cup champion seven times, Hapoel has won the Cup only once. Beitar has won the top league six times, while Hapoel has never succeeded. Beitar plays in the more prestigious Ligat HaAl, while Hapoel is in the second division Liga Leumit. Since its opening in 1992, Teddy Stadium has been Jerusalem's primary football stadium, with a capacity of 31,733.\nThe most popular Palestinian football club is Jabal Al Mukaber (since 1976) which plays in West Bank Premier League. The club hails from Mount Scopus at Jerusalem, part of the Asian Football Confederation, and plays at the Faisal Al-Husseini International Stadium at Al-Ram, across the West Bank Barrier.\nIn basketball Hapoel Jerusalem is one of the top teams in the top division.

          "summary": "Jerusalem is a city in the Southern Levant, on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Both Israel and Palestine claim Jerusalem as their capital city; Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there, while Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power. Neither claim is widely recognised internationally.\nThroughout its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. During the Canaanite period (14th century BCE) Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning \"City of Shalem\" after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 10th century BCE (Iron Age II), and by the 9th century BCE the city had developed into the religious and administrative centre of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538 the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today those walls define the Old City, which since the 19th century has been divided into four quarters—the Armenian, Christian, Jewish and Muslim quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2023 Jerusalem had a population of 1,028,366. In 2022 60% were Jews and almost 40% were Palestinians. In 2020 the population was 951,100, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353,800 (37.2%), Christians 16,300 (1.7%) and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son King Solomon commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Israelites branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous—and later monotheistic—religion centred on El/Yahweh. These foundational events assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city (Hebrew: עיר הקודש, romanized: 'Ir ha-Qodesh) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians adopted as the Old Testament, was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection there. Meanwhile, in Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. The city was the first standard direction for Muslim prayers, and in Islamic tradition, Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he spoke to God, per the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (3⁄8 sq mi), the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nAt present, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, Jerusalem was to be \"established as a corpus separatum under a special international regime\" administered by the United Nations. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas incorporated into Israel, while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was occupied and annexed by Jordan. Israel occupied East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into the city's municipality, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residences of the prime minister and president, and the Supreme Court. The international community rejects the annexation as illegal and regards East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.",

          "content": "القُدْس هي اكبر مدن فِلسْطِين المحتلّه مساحهً وسكانًا واكثرها اهميه دينيًا واقتصاديًا. تُعرف باسماء اخرى في اللغه العربيه مثل: بيت المقدس، القدس الشريف، اولى القبلتين، وفي الكتاب المقدس باسم اورشليم، وتسميها اسرائيل رسمياً: اورشليم القدس.\nيعتبرها العرب والفلسطينيون وقطاع عريض من داعمي القضيه الفلسطينيه، عاصمهَ دوله فلسطين المستقبليه بعد التحرير، كما ورد في وثيقه اعلان الاستقلال الفلسطينيه التي صدرت في الجزائر بتاريخ 15 نوفمبر سنه 1988م، (اما تاريخياً كون اجدادهم اليبوسيين تاريخياً، اول من بنى المدينه وسكنها في الالف الخامس ق.م). فيما تعتبرها اسرائيل عاصمتها الموحده، اثر ضمها الجزء الشرقي من المدينه عام 1980م، والذي احتلته بعد حرب سنه 1967 (يعتبرها اليهود عاصمتهم الدينيه والوطنيه لاكثر من 3000 سنه). اما الامم المتحده والمجتمع الدولي، فلا يعترف بالقدس عاصمه لاسرائيل، ويعتبر القدس الشرقيه جزءاً من الاراضي الفلسطينيه، ولا يعترف بضمها للدوله العبريه، مع بعض الاستثناءات. تقع القدس ضمن سلسله جبال الخليل وتتوسط المنطقه الواقعه بين البحر المتوسط والطرف الشمالي للبحر الميت، وقد نمت هذه المدينه وتوسعت حدودها كثيرًا عما كانت عليه في العصور السابقه.\nتُعتبر القدس مدينه مقدسه عند اتباع الديانات الابراهيميه الثلاث الرئيسيه: اليهوديه، المسيحيه، الاسلام. فبالنسبه لليهود، اصبحت المدينه اقدس المواقع بعد ان فتحها النبي والملك داود وجعل منها عاصمه مملكه اسرائيل الموحده حوالي سنه 1000 ق.م، ثم اقدم ابنه سليمان، على بناء اول هيكل فيها، كما تنص التوراه. وعند المسيحيين، اصبحت المدينه موقعًا مقدسًا، بعد ان صُلب يسوع المسيح على احدى تلالها المسماه «جلجثه» حوالي سنه 30 للميلاد، وبعد ان عثرت القديسه هيلانه على الصليب الذي عُلّق عليه بداخل المدينه بعد حوالي 300 سنه، وفقًا لما جاء في العهد الجديد. اما عند المسلمين، فالقدس هي ثالث اقدس المدن بعد مكه والمدينه المنوره، وهي اولى القبلتين، حيث كان المسلمون يتوجهون اليها في صلاتهم بعد ان فُرضت عليهم حوالي سنه 610 للميلاد، وهي ايضًا تمثل الموقع الذي عرج منه نبي الاسلام محمد بن عبد الله الى السماء وفقًا للمعتقد الاسلامي. وكنتيجه لهذه الاهميه الدينيه العظمى، تحوي المدينه القديمه عددًا من المعالم الدينيه ذات الاهميه الكبرى، مثل: كنيسه القيامه، حائط البراق والمسجد الاقصى - المكون من عده معالم مقدسه اهمها مسجد قبه الصخره والمسجد القبلي، على الرغم من ان مساحتها تصل الى 0.9 كيلومترات مربعه (0.35 اميال مربعه).\nخلال تاريخها الطويل، تعرضت القدس للتدمير مرتين، وحوصرت 23 مره، وهوجمت 52 مره، وتمّ غزوها وفقدانها مجددًا 44 مره. استوطن البشر الموقع الذي شُيدت به المدينه منذ الالفيه الرابعه ق.م، الامر الذي يجعل من القدس احدى اقدم المدن الماهوله في العالم. تُصنّف المدينه القديمه على انها موقع تراث عالمي، وقد جرت العاده والعرف على تقسيمها الى 4 حارات، الا ان الاسماء المستخدمه اليوم لكل حاره من هذه الحارات: حاره الارمن، حاره النصارى، حاره الشرف (او حاره اليهود)، وحاره المسلمين، لم تظهر الا في اوائل القرن التاسع عشر. رشحت الاردن المدينه القديمه لتُدرج ضمن قائمه مواقع التراث العالمي المهدده في سنه 1982.\nيُعتبر النزاع القائم حول وضع القدس مسالهً محوريه في الصراع العربي الاسرائيلي. اقدمت الحكومه الاسرائيليه بعد حرب سنه 1967 بين الجيوش العربيه والاسرائيليه على احتلال القدس الشرقيه التي كانت تتبع الاردن، والحقتها باسرائيل واعتبرتها جزءاً لا يتجزا منها، الا ان المجتمع الدولي باغلبيته، لم يعترف بهذا الضم، وما زال ينظر الى القدس الشرقيه على انها منطقه متنازع عليها ويدعو بين الحين والاخر الى حل هذه القضيه عن طريق اجراء مفاوضات سلميّه بين اسرائيل والفلسطينيين. كذلك، فان اغلبيه الدول في العالم لا تعترف بالقدس عاصمه لاسرائيل، لذا فان معظم السفارات والقنصليات الاجنبيه تقع في مدينه تل ابيب وضواحيها. طالب الفلسطينيون -وما زالوا- بالقدس الشرقيه عاصمهً لدوله فلسطينيه، منذ ان احتلها الاسرائيليون، الا ان البرلمان الاسرائيلي اقرّ في 31 يوليو سنه 1980 «قانون اساس: القدس عاصمه اسرائيل»، الذي جعل اعلان القدس، بالحدود التي رسمتها الحكومه الاسرائيليه عام 1967، مبداً دستوريًا في القانون الاسرائيلي. رد مجلس الامن بقرارين، رقم 476 ورقم 478 سنه 1980 وجه اللوم الى اسرائيل بسبب اقرار هذا القانون واكد انه يخالف القانون الدولي، وليس من شانه ان يمنع استمرار سريان اتفاقيه جنيف الرابعه لسنه 1949 على الجزء الشرقي من القدس، كما ويفترض ان تكون المدينه ضمن محافظه القدس التابعه لدوله فلسطين. ادارت منظمه التحرير الفلسطينيه مركزًا لها في بيت الشرق بالقدس الا انه اغلق في سنه 2001 بامر من وزاره الداخليه الاسرائيليه.\nتقع معظم الادارات الحكوميه الاسرائيليه في القدس الغربيه، وهي تشمل: البرلمان الاسرائيلي او الكنيست، مقريّ رئيس الوزراء ورئيس الدوله، والمحكمه العليا. القدس ايضًا هي مقر الجامعه العبريه ومتحف اسرائيل ومزار الكتاب، وفيها ايضًا حديقه الحيوان الكتابيه، التي تُصنّف على انها جاذب هام في السياحه الداخليه، واستاد تيدي الذي يُعتبر احد اهم واكبر ملاعب كره القدم في اسرائيل.\n\nالتسميه\nاوّل اسم ثابت لمدينه القدس هو «اورسالم» الذي يظهر في رسائل تل العمارنه المصريه، ويعني اسس سالم؛ وسالم او شالم هو اسم الاله الكنعاني حامي المدينه، وقيل مدينه السلام. وقد ظهرت هذه التسميه مرتين في الوثائق المصريه القديمه: حوالي سنه 2000 ق.م و1330 ق.م، ثم ما لبثت تلك المدينه، وفقًا لسفر الملوك الثاني، ان اخذت اسم «يبوس» نسبه الى اليبوسيين، المتفرعين من الكنعانيين، وقد بنوا قلعتها والتي تعني بالكنعانيه مرتفع. تذكر مصادر تاريخيه عن الملك اليبوسي «ملكي صادق» انه هو اول من بنى يبوس او القدس، وكان محبًا للسلام، حتى اُطلق عليه «ملك السلام» ومن هنا جاء اسم المدينه وقد قيل انه هو من سماها باورسالم اي «مدينه سالم».\nظهر الاسم «اورشليم» اوّل ما ظهر في الكتاب المقدس، وفي سفر يشوع تحديدًا، ويقول الخبراء اللغويون انه نحت، اي دمج، لكلمتيّ اور، التي تعني «موقع مخصص لعباده الله وخدمته»، والجذر اللغوي س ل م، الذي يعني على ما يُعتقد «سلام»، او يشير الى اله كنعاني قديم اسمه «شاليم»، وهو اله الغسق. اطلق العبرانيون على اقدم الاقسام الماهوله من المدينه اسميّ «مدينه داود» و«صهيون»، وقد اصبحت هذه الاسماء القاب ونعوت للمدينه ككل فيما بعد بحسب التقليد اليهودي. حُرّف اسم القدس من قبل الاغريق خلال العصر الهيليني، فاصبح يُلفظ «هيروسليما» (باليونانيه: Ἱεροσόλυμα)، وعند سيطره الامبراطوريه الرومانيه على حوض البحر المتوسط، اطلق الرومان على المدينه تسميه «مستعمره ايليا الكاپيتولينيّه» (باللاتينيه: Colonia Aelia Capitolina) سنه 131 للميلاد. في بعض الرسائل الاسلاميه باللغه العربيه من القرون الوسطى، وخصوصًا في العهده العمريه، تذكر المدينه باسم «ايلياء» او «ايليا» وهو على ما يبدو اختصار لاسمها اللاتيني. ذُكرت المدينه في فتره لاحقه من القرون الوسطى باسم «بيت المقدس»، وهو ماخوذ من الاراميه בית מקדשא بمعنى «الكنيس». ولا يزال هذا الاسم يُستخدم في بعض اللغات مثل اللغه الارديه، وهو مصدر لقب «مقدسي» الذي يطلق على سكان المدينه.\nاما اسم القدس الشائع اليوم في العربيه وخاصه لدى المسلمين فقد يكون اختصارًا لاسم «بيت المقدس» او لعباره «مدينه القدس» وكثيرًا ما يُقال «القدس الشريف» لتاكيد قدسيه المدينه. اما السلطات الاسرائيليه فتشير في اعلاناتها الى المدينه باسم «اورشليم القدس».\n\nتاريخ القدس\nنظره شامله\nتلعب القدس دورًا اساسيًا عند الحديث عن القوميه العربيه عمومًا والوطنيه الفلسطينيه خصوصًا، وكذلك بالنسبه للقوميه الاسرائيليه او الصهيونيه، لذا فان الحديث عن تاريخها الطويل، الذي يمتد لاكثر من 5,000 سنه، غالبًا ما ياخذ منحى متحيزًا من الناحيه الايديولوجيه. فعلى سبيل المثال، يُركز القوميون الاسرائيليون على الحقبه التاريخيه التي استوطن فيها بنو اسرائيل ارض فلسطين ويزعمون بان جميع يهود العالم اليوم ينحدرون من اولئك القوم الى جانب المكابيين، مما يدعم قضيتهم الهادفه الى توطين يهود العالم في فلسطين ويعزز من موقفهم امام الشعوب المختلفه، حيث يُظهرون انهم الورثه الشرعيين للمدينه والبلاد ككل. ومن ناحيه اخرى، يُركز القوميون العرب والفلسطينيين على الحقبتين المسيحيه والاسلاميه وغيرها من الحقبات غير الاسرائيليه في تاريخ المدينه، مما يدعم قضيتهم التي تقول بان الفلسطينيين الحاليين هم ورثه المدينه والبلاد بما انهم ينحدرون من جميع الشعوب والامم التي سكنت القدس وفلسطين عبر العصور وتزاوجت واختلطت. وكنتيجه لهذا التباين، يزعم كل من الاسرائيليين والفلسطينيين ان الطرف الاخر يُحرّف التاريخ لتحقيق مصالحه الخاصه والقضاء على مصالح الاخر، ولتاييد ادعائه باحقيته بالمدينه، وبطبيعه الحال فان كل طرف وجد المؤيدين لرايه، واغلبهم من ذات القوميه، والمعارضين، واغلبهم من القوميه الاخرى.\n\nالعهد الكنعاني\nاظهرت بعض التنقيبات الاثريه وجود بعض الاواني الخزفيه في مدينه داود، الواقعه ضمن حدود القدس حاليًا، والتي تعود لحوالي الالفيه الرابعه قبل الميلاد، اي منذ العصر النحاسي، واظهرت اكتشافات اخرى وجود مستعمره بشريه قامت خلال اوائل العصر البرونزي (ما بين عاميّ 3000 و2800 ق.م تقريبًا)، ويقول بعض المؤرخين ان من اسسها هم الكنعانيون الذين سكنوا فلسطين في الالف الثالث قبل الميلاد، وخلال هذه الفتره قدم اليها العرب الساميون في هجرتين كبيرتين: الاولى في بدايه الالف الثالث قبل الميلاد، والثانيه في بدايه الالف الثاني قبل الميلاد، بينما يقول اخرون، مثل عالمه الاثار البريطانيه كاتلين كينيون، ان القدس تاسست على يد قوم ساميين شماليين غربيين حوالي سنه 2600 قبل الميلاد. ورد اول ذكر لتجمع سكاني في موقع القدس في رسائل اللعنه الفرعونيه من القرن الثامن عشر قبل الميلاد، ويُذكر موقع القدس فيها باسم اشمام كاحد تجمعات العدو الذي يجب لعنه كي لا يضر بالجيوش المصريه.\nتنص التوراه على ان المدينه تاسست على يد سام بن نوح، وعابر حفيد سام، من اسلاف النبي ابراهيم (وهو ابو الانبياء جميعا وجدهم)، وسكنها في ذلك الوقت شعب يُعرف بشعب اليبوسيين، فسُميت المدينه «يبوس» تيمنًا بسكانها. ازدهرت المدينه في عهد ملكي صادق، وهو احد ملوك اليبوسيين خلال فتره بعثه ابراهيم، واستمر الوضع كما هو الى حين عهد يشوع، عندما دخلت المدينه في نطاق الاراضي الخاضعه لبني بنيامين، يشوع 28/18] الا انها استمرت ماهوله باليبوسيين بعد ان لم يتمكن بنو بنيامين من طردهم. سيطر الملك والنبي داود على المدينه حوالي سنه 1000 ق.م، بعد ان احتلها من اليبوسيين، وجعل منها عاصمه لمملكته. اظهرت اعمال التنقيب مؤخرًا وجود اساسات حجريه ضخمه في وسط القدس، قال الاسرائيليون بانها بقايا هيكل داود، وقد توقفت اعمال التنقيب بعد ان صرّح الخبراء باعتقادهم هذا، الى حين ان يتم التصديق على هذا الامر من قبل مفسري التوراه.\n\nعهد الهياكل\nتنص المخطوطات العبرانيه على ان النبي داود دام حكمه لمملكه اسرائيل 40 عامًا، وبالتحديد حتى سنه 970 ق.م، وبعد وفاته خلفه ولده سليمان الذي حكم طيله 33 عامًا، وفي عهده تمّ تشييد هيكل المدينه على جبل موريا، بالاضافه الى هيكل سليمان الشهير، الذي يلعب دورًا مهمًا عند اليهود، كونه يمثل المستودع الذي حُفظ فيه تابوت العهد وفقًا للمعتقد اليهودي. اصبحت القدس تُسمى بالمدينه المقدسه في عام 975 ق.م، وشكّلت عاصمه لمملكه اسرائيل الموحده، وبعد وفاه سليمان انقسمت المملكه الى قسمين شمالي وجنوبي وذلك بعد تمرد الاسباط العبريه الشماليه بسبط يهوذا الجنوبي الذي كان ال داود ينتمون اليه. سُمي القسم الجنوبي بمملكه يهوذا في الجنوب، واصبحت القدس عاصمه لها تحت قياده رحبعام بن سليمان. وفي سنه 587 ق.م، احتل الملك البابلي «نبوخذ نصّر الثاني» مدينه القدس بعد ان هزم اخر ملوك اليهود «صدقيا بن يوشيا»، ونقل من بقي فيها من اليهود اسرى الى بابل بمن فيهم الملك صدقيا نفسه، وعاث في المدينه دمارًا وخرابًا واقدم على تدمير هيكل سليمان، مما انهى الفتره التي يُطلق عليها المؤرخون تسميه «عهد الهيكل الاول».\n\nبعد 50 سنه من السبي الى بابل، سمح الملك الفارسي قورش الكبير عام 538 ق.م لمن اراد من اسرى اليهود في بابل بالعوده الى القدس واعاده بناء الهيكل المهدم، فعاد عدد من اليهود الى القدس وشرعوا ببناء الهيكل الثاني، وانتهوا من العمل به سنه 516 ق.م، في عهد الملك الفارسي دارا الاول، وعُرف فيما بعد بمعبد حيرود تيمنًا بملك اليهود حيرود الكبير الذي قام بتوسيعه. وحوالي سنه 445 ق.م، اصدر الملك الفارسي «ارتحشستا الاول» مرسومًا سمح فيه لسكان المدينه باعاده بناء اسوارها، واستمرت المدينه عاصمه لمملكه يهوذا طيله العقود التي تلت. فقدت الامبراطوريه الفارسيه فلسطين بما فيها القدس لصالح القائد والملك المقدوني، الاسكندر الاكبر، عام 333 ق.م، وبعد وفاته استمر خلفاؤه المقدونيون البطالمه في حكم المدينه، واستولى عليها في العام نفسه بطليموس الاول وضمها مع فلسطين الى مملكته في مصر عام 323 ق.م. ثم في عام 198 ق.م، خسر بطليموس الخامس القدس ومملكه يهوذا لصالح السلوقيين في سوريا، بقياده انطيوخوس الثالث الكبير. حاول الاغريق ان يطبعوا المدينه بطابعهم الخاص ويجعلوا منها مدينه هيلينيه تقليديه، لكن هذه المحاوله باءت بالفشل سنه 168 ق.م، عندما قام المكابيين بثوره على الحاكم انطيوخوس الرابع، تحت قياده كبير الكهنه «متياس» وابنائه الخمسه، ونجحوا بتاسيس المملكه الحشمونائيميه وعاصمتها القدس سنه 152 ق.م. استولى قائد الجيش الروماني «پومپيوس الكبير»، على القدس في عام 63 ق.م بعد ان استغل صراعًا على سدّه المُلك بين الملوك الحشمونائيميه، وبهذا ضُمت القدس الى الجمهوريه الرومانيه.\n\nالحروب اليهوديه الرومانيه\nاقدم الرومان على تنصيب حيرود الاول ملكًا على اليهود ليضمنوا سيطرتهم وتحكمهم بمملكه يهوذا، فكرّس حيرود عهده لتجميل المدينه وتطوير مرافقها، فبنى عددًا من الاسوار والقصور والابراج والقلاع، وقام بتوسيع المعبد حتى تضاعف حجم المنطقه حيث يقع. وبعد وفاه حيرود الاول في السنه السادسه قبل الميلاد، خلفه حيرود الثاني في حكم القدس من عام 4 قبل الميلاد حتى 6 بعده وعندها اخضع الرومان مملكه يهوذا للحكم الروماني المباشر نتيجه لعدم ثقه الحكومه بحيرود، فاصبحت تُعرف بمقاطعه اليهوديه، على الرغم من ان خلفاء حيرود الاول، المتحدرين من اغريباس الثاني، استمروا بحكم المناطق المجاوره بوصفهم ملوك تابعين لروما حتى سنه 96 ميلاديه.\nشهد الحكم الروماني المباشر للقدس حوادث كثيره، اولها الثوره اليهوديه الكبرى، التي استمرت من سنه 66 الى سنه 70م، حيث قام اليهود في القدس باعمال شغب وعصيان مدني قمعها الحاكم الروماني «تيطس» بالقوه فاحرق المدينه واسر كثيراً من اليهود ودُمّر المعبد للمره الثانيه، وعادت الامور الى طبيعتها في ظل الاحتلال الروماني للمدينه المقدسه. ثم عاود اليهود التمرد واعلان العصيان مرتين في عاميّ 115 و132م، والمره الاخيره عُرفت بثوره شمعون بن كوكبه، تيمنًا بقائد العصيان، وخلالها تمكن اليهود بالفعل من السيطره على المدينه، واعلنوها عاصمه لمملكه يهوذا مجددًا، الا ان الامبراطور الروماني «هادريان» تعامل مع الثوّار بعنف واسفر ذلك عن تدمير القدس للمره الثانيه، واخرج اليهود المقيمين فيها ولم يبق الا المسيحيين، ومن شدّه نقمه الامبراطور على اليهود، اصدر مرسومًا بجعل المدينه ذات طابع روماني فتم تغيير اسمها الى «مستعمره ايليا الكاپيتولينيّه» واشترط الا يسكنها يهودي، بل اقدم على تغيير اسم مقاطعه اليهوديه بكاملها وجعله «مقاطعه سوريا الفلسطينيه» (باللاتينيه: Syria Palaestina) تيمنًا بالفلستينيون الذين سكنوا الساحل الجنوبي الكنعانيون.\n\nخضعت المدينه لسيطره الرومان ثم الروم البيزنطيين خلال القرون الخمسه التي تلت ثوره شمعون بن كوكبه، وبعد ان نقل الامبراطور الروماني قسطنطين الاول عاصمه الامبراطوريه الرومانيه من روما الى بيزنطيه، واعلن المسيحيه ديانه رسميه للدوله، امر بتشييد عدد من المعالم المسيحيه بالقدس، فبنيت كنيسه القيامه عام 326م، فكانت تلك نقطه تحول بالنسبه للمسيحيين في المدينه، حيث لم يعودوا مضطهدين، واستطاعوا ممارسه شعائرهم الدينيه بحريّه. اصبحت القدس مركزًا لبطريركيه من البطريركيات الخمس الكبرى، وهي الى جانب القدس: الاسكندريه وروما والقسطنطينيه وانطاكيه، بعد ان تقرر انشائها في مجمع نيقيه. استمرت القدس بالنمو والاتساع منذ ان انتهى عهد الهيكل الثاني بعد تدمير الاخير، حيث بلغت مساحتها كيلومترين مربعين (0.8 اميال مربعه.) ووصل عدد سكانها الى حوالي 200,000 نسمه. استمر حظر دخول اليهود الى القدس طيله عهد قسطنطين الاول حتى القرن السابع الميلادي.\n\nحروب الروم والفرس\nانقسمت الامبراطوريه الرومانيه عام 395م الى قسمين متناحرين: الامبراطوريه الغربيه وعاصمتها روما، والامبراطوريه الشرقيه او البيزنطيه وعاصمتها القسطنطينيه، وخضعت القدس مع باقي بلاد الشام الى الامبراطوريه الاخيره. شجع الانقسام الروماني الفرس على الاغاره على القدس، فامر شاه الامبراطوريه الساسانيه، كسرى الثاني، قائدا جيوشه «شهربراز» و«شاهين»، بالسير الى سوريا واستخلاص القدس من ايدي الروم، ففعلا ما طُلب منهما ونجحا في احتلالها، خصوصًا بعد ان ساعدهم اليهود في فلسطين، الذين كانوا ناقمين على البيزنطيين.\nفتح الفرس المدينه في سنه 614م، بعد حصار استمر 21 يومًا. تنص السجلات البيزنطيه ان الفرس واليهود ذبحوا الاف المسيحيين من سكان القدس، وما زال هذا الامر موضع جدال بين المؤرخين، حيث قال البعض بصحته ونفاه البعض الاخر. استمرت المدينه خاضعه للفرس طيله 15 سنه، الى ان استطاع الروم استعادتها سنه 629م تحت قياده الامبراطور هرقل، وظلت بايديهم حتى الفتح الاسلامي عام 636م.\nيؤمن المسلمون انه خلال هذه الفتره، وبالتحديد في عام 621م تقريبًا، شهدت القدس زياره النبي محمد، حيث اسرى به الملاك جبريل ليلاً من المسجد الحرام الى المسجد الاقصى ثم صعد الى السماوات العلى حيث راى الانبياء والرسل السابقين وعاد بعد ان خاطب الله الذي علّمه عدد الصلوات المفروضه على الانسان، وبهذا الحدث، اصبحت القدس ثالث اقدس الاماكن عند المسلمين.\n\nالفتح الاسلامي\nاصبحت القدس مدينه مقدسه بالنسبه للمسلمين بعد حادثه الاسراء والمعراج، وبعد ان فُرضت الصلاه على المسلمين، اصبحوا يتوجهون اثناء اقامتها نحو المدينه، وبعد حوالي 16 شهرًا، عاد المسلمون ليتوجهوا في صلاتهم نحو مكه بدلاً من القدس، بسبب كثره تعيير اليهود للنبي محمد وللمسلمين بسبب استقبالهم لقبله اليهود، ولاسباب اخرى.\n\nفي عهد عمر بن الخطاب والفتوحات الاسلاميه، اُرسل عمرو بن العاص وابو عبيده بن الجراح لفتح فلسطين عامه ونشر الدعوه الاسلاميه فيها، لكن القدس عصيت عليهم ولم يتمكنوا من فتحها لمناعه اسوارها، حيث اعتصم اهلها داخل الاسوار. وعندما طال حصار المسلمين لها، طلب رئيس البطاركه والاساقفه، المدعو «صفرونيوس»، طلب منهم ان لا يسلم القدس الا للخليفه عمر بن الخطاب بشخصه. فارسل عمرو بن العاص يخبر عمر في المدينه بما طلبه صفرونيوس رئيس الاساقفه المسيحيين في القدس فاستشار الخليفه عمر بن الخطاب اصحابه فكان اول من تكلم عثمان بن عفان فقال: «اقم ولا تسر اليهم فاذا راوا انك بامرهم مستخفن ولقتالهم مستحقر فلا يلبثون الا اليسير حتى ينزلوا على الصغار ويعطوا الجزيه». وقال علي بن ابي طالب: «اني ارى انك ان سرت اليهم فتح الله هذه المدينه على يديك وكان في مسيرك الاجر العظيم». ففرح عمر بن الخطاب بمشوره علي فقال: «لقد احسن عثمان النظر في المكيده للعدو واحسن علي المشوره للمسلمين فجزاهما الله خيراً ولست اخذاً الا بمشوره علي فما عرفناه الا محمود المشوره ميمون الغره».\nفقصد عمر بن الخطاب وخادمه ومعهما ناقه الى بيت المقدس في رحله شاقه. وما ان وصلا مشارف القدس حتى اطل عليهما صفرونيوس والبطاركه وسالوا من هذين الرجلين فقال المسلمون انه عمر بن الخطاب وخادمه، فسال ايهما عمر فقيل ذاك الواقف على قدميه اذ كان خادمه ممتطيا الناقه فذهلوا بهذا لانه مذكور في كتبهم، فكان الفتح العمري لبيت المقدس. كتب عمر مع المسيحيين وثيقهً عُرفت باسم «العهده العمريه» وهي وثيقه منحتهم الحريه الدينيه مقابل الجزيه، وتعهد بالحفاظ على ممتلكاتهم ومقدساتهم، وعرض صفرونيوس على عمر بن الخطاب ان يؤدي الصلاه في كنيسه القيامه بعد ان حان موعدها اثناء زيارته لها، فخرج من الكنيسه وصلى على مبعده منها وعاد. ولمّا ساله البطريرك صفرونيوس عن السبب اجابه انه يخاف من ان يتخذ المسلمون من فعله ذريعه فيما بعد للسيطره على الكنيسه فيقولون من بعده «ها هنا صلّى عمر» وبالتالي يحولون الكنيسه الى مسجد للمسلمين. سمح المسلمون لليهود بالرجوع للسكن في المدينه بعد فتحها، وطبقوا عليهم ما طبقوه على المسيحيين من حمايه لمقدساتهم مقابل الجزيه. اقام المسلمون مسجدًا في الموقع الذي صلّى به عمر بن الخطاب، بالقرب من مدخل كنيسه القيامه اليوم، وقال الاسقف الغالي «اركولف» الذي عاش في القدس من سنه 679 حتى سنه 688، ان مسجد عمر كان مبنًى خشبيًا مربع الشكل بُني على انقاض بعض المباني والمنشات، وكان يتسع لحوالي 3,000 مصل.\n\nقام عمر بن الخطاب بعد فتح المدينه بالبحث عن مكان المسجد الاقصى المذكور في القران والصخره المقدسه واضعًا نصب عينيه الروايه التي سمعها من محمد ليله الاسراء، وسال الصحابه وكعب الاحبار، وهو من اليهود الذين اسلموا، والبطريرك صفرنيوس، وكان عمر بن الخطاب يراجع المرافقين له حين يدلونه على مكان لا يجد اوصافه تنطبق على ما لديه قائلاً: «لقد وصف لي رسول الله صلّى الله عليه وسلم المسجد بصفه ما هي عليه هذه». وقد عثر الخليفه على مكان المسجد الاقصى والصخره المقدسه في وقت قصير، وكان المكان مطموراً بالاتربه التي تكاد تخفي معالمه. وامر عمر بن الخطاب باقامه مسجد موضع المسجد الاول، واقامه ظله من الخشب فوق الصخره المقدسه، وعندما جاء الخليفه الاموي عبد الملك بن مروان بنى قبه الصخره فوق الصخره المقدسه عام 691، ثم بنى الخليفه الوليد بن عبد الملك الجامع القبلي عام 709. يقول المؤرخ من القرن العاشر، محمد بن احمد شمس الدين المقدسي، ان عبد الملك بن مروان بنى قبه الصخره وجعل منها ذهبيه كي تطغى على قبب الكنائس المنتشره في القدس، ولتصبح معلمًا بارزًا يلفت نظر الزائر اوّل ما يراها. اهتم الامويون والعباسيون بالمدينه فشهدت نهضه علميه في مختلف الميادين، لكن شهرتها سرعان ما تضعضعت بسبب عدم الاستقرار الذي شهدته الدوله العباسيه وانقسامها الى دويلات عديده.\n\nعهد الصليبيين، الايوبيين، والمماليك\nادّى تفكك الدوله العباسيه الى دويلات متناحره الى ضعف العمل بالشريعه الاسلاميه من قبل بعض الحكّام، فلقي المسيحيون كثيرًا من الاضطهاد، وهُدمت كنيسه القيامه في القدس خلال عهد الخليفه الفاطمي، ابو علي منصور الحاكم بامر الله، وتعرّضت حياه الحجاج الاوروبيين للخطر. وعندما سقطت القدس بقبضه الاتراك السلاجقه سنه 1076، ازدادت الحاله سوءًا وكثر التعدي على الحجاج الاوروبيين بشكل خاص بسبب ما كانوا يحملونه معهم من النفائس والاموال، فكانت تلك احدى الاسباب التي ادّت لنشوب الحروب الصليبيه. انطلق الصليبيون في حملتهم الاولى سنه 1095 متوجهين الى مدينه القدس، فوصلوها في سنه 1099 وضربوا الحصار عليها فسقطت في ايديهم بعد شهر من الحصار، وقتل الصليبيون فور دخولهم القدس قرابه 70 الفًا من المسلمين واليهود وانتهكوا مقدساتهم، وقامت في القدس منذ ذلك التاريخ مملكه لاتينيه تُحكم من قبل ملك كاثوليكي فرض الشعائر الكاثوليكيه على المسيحيين الارثوذكس مما اثار غضبهم.\n\nاستطاع صلاح الدين الايوبي استرداد القدس من الصليبيين عام 1187 بعد معركه حطين، وعامل اهلها معامله طيبه، وازال الصليب عن قبه الصخره، ودعا اليهود والمسلمين ليعودوا الى المدينه، واهتم بعمارتها وتحصينها. ولكن الصليبيين نجحوا في السيطره على المدينه بعد وفاه صلاح الدين في عهد الامبراطور فريدريش الاول بربروسا امبراطور الامبراطوريه الرومانيه المقدسه، وكانت القدس في هذه الفتره قد ضعف شانها وافل نجمها واصبحت مجرّد قريه عاديّه نظرًا لتراجع اهميتها الاستراتيجيه، خصوصًا بسبب انهماك اولاد صلاح الدين بالنزاع فيما بينهم، وعدم تركيزهم على محاربه الصليبيين. ظلت القدس بايدي الصليبيين 11 عامًا الى ان استردها نهائياً الملك الصالح نجم الدين ايوب عام 1244.\nتعرضت المدينه لغزو التتار الخوارزميين عام 1244، الذين قضوا على القسم الاعظم من سكانها المسيحيين وطردوا اليهود منهم. هُزم التتار على يد المماليك بقياده سيف الدين قطز والظاهر بيبرس في معركه عين جالوت عام 1259، وضمت فلسطين بما فيها القدس الى السلطنه المملوكيه التي حكمت مصر والشام بعد الدوله الايوبيه حتى عام 1517. وخلال هذه الفتره تعرّضت المدينه والمنطقه ككل لسلسله من الزلازل وتفشّى فيها وباء الطاعون الاسود.\n\nالعهد العثماني\nدخلت جيوش العثمانيين فلسطين بقياده السلطان سليم الاول بعد معركه مرج دابق في سنه 1517، واصبحت القدس مدينه تابعه للدوله العثمانيه طيله 400 سنه حتى سقوطها بيد قوّات الحلفاء في الحرب العالميه الاولى سنه 1917. تمتعت القدس بعهد من الرخاء والازدهار خلال عهد السلطان سليمان الاول \"القانوني\"، خليفه سليم الاول، حيث اعاد الاخير بناء اسوار المدينه وقبه الصخره. استمرت القدس خلال معظم العهد العثماني مجرّد مدينه محلّيه عاديه ولم يعلوا شانها التجاري او الثقافي بشكل يُذكر، لكنها بقيت من ضمن المدن العثمانيه المهمه نظرًا لمكانتها الدينيه. تطوّرت الحياه المقدسيّه بشكل ملحوظ خلال القرن التاسع عشر بعد ان انشات السلطات العثمانيه عدد من المرافق الحديثه لتسهيل حياه الناس، فافتتح مركز للبريد وانشات خطوط سير نظاميه مخصصه لمركبات الجياد العموميه، واُنيرت الشوارع بالمصابيح الزيتيّه، وفي اواسط القرن سالف الذكر انشا العثمانيون اوّل طريق معبّده بين القدس ويافا، وبحلول عام 1892، كانت المدينه موصوله بغيرها من المدن الشاميّه والحجازيه بسكه حديديه.\nخلال الفتره الممتده من عام 1831 حتى عام 1840، اصبحت فلسطين جزءًا من الدوله المصريه التي اقامها محمد علي باشا، وخلال هذا العهد اخذت الارساليات والقنصليات الاجنبيه تضع موطئ قدم لها في المدينه. وفي سنه 1836، سمح ابراهيم باشا بن محمد علي، سمح لليهود ان يعيدوا انشاء اربعه معابد رئيسيّه، ومن ضمنها كنيس الخراب. ثار الشوام على الحكم المصري بعد ان استقر في البلاد لاسباب مختلفه منها زياده الضرائب بمقدار لم يعهده الناس ايام العثمانيين والتجنيد الاجباري في الجيش المصري، وكان من ضمن هذه الثورات ثوره قامت في سنه 1834 بفلسطين بقياده قاسم الاحمد، الذي قاد جيشًا من الثوّار من مدينه نابلس تعاونه عشائر بلده ابو غوش، وهاجم القدس ودخلها بتاريخ 31 مايو 1834، لكن الجيش المصري استطاع ان يرد الثوّار على اعقابهم في الشهر التالي.\nعادت القدس الى الحكم العثماني بعد هزيمه المصريين امام الجيوش الحليفه العثمانيه والاوروبيه سنه 1840، الا ان كثيرًا من المصريين بقي واستقر بالمدينه، وفي نفس الفتره قدمت وفود من اليهود والمسلمين المغاربه، من مدينه الجزائر وغيرها من مدن المغرب العربي، واستقرت في القدس. اخذت القوى العظمى في العالم تتدخل في الشؤون الداخليه العثمانيه بشكل متزايد خلال عقد الاربعينيات والخمسينيات من القرن التاسع عشر، بحجه حمايه الاقليات الدينيه في الدوله العثمانيه، وقد لعب القناصله في القدس دورًا كبيرًا في هذه المساله. افاد القنصل البروسي بالقدس ان عدد سكان المدينه في سنه 1845 وصل الى 16,410 نسمه، منهم 7,120 يهودي، 5,000 مسلم، 3,390 مسيحي، 800 جندي تركي، و100 شخص اوروبي. ارتفعت نسبه الحجاج المسيحيين في المدينه خلال العهد العثماني، الامر الذي كان يجعل جمهره المسيحيين بالقدس تتضاعف في حجمها خلال موسم الفصح.\n\nاخذت المنازل تظهر خارج اسوار القدس خلال عقد الستينيات من القرن التاسع عشر، بعد ان ازداد عدد سكان المدينه بفعل المهاجرين، ولاقامه منشات اكثر صحيّه مخصصه لاستضافه الحجاج المسيحيين، خصوصًا وان كثيرًا منهم كان يشتكي من الاكتظاظ السكاني داخل المدينه ومن رداءه نظام الصرف الصحي. ومن المنشات المهمه التي برزت خلال هذه الفتره، المجمّع الروسي سنه 1860، الذي خُصص لاستقبال وايواء الحجاج الروس الارثوذكس. قدّرت احدى احصائيات ارساليه امريكيه عدد سكان القدس سنه 1867 «باكثر من» 15,000 نسمه، 6,000 منهم مسلمين، وما بين 4,000 الى 5,000 منهم يهود، كذلك تبيّن ان عدد الحجاج الروس كان يتراوح بين 5,000 الى 6,000 حاج كل عام. انشات الدوله العثمانيه عام 1880 متصرفيه القدس، وازيل الحائط القديم للمدينه عام 1898 لتسهيل دخول القيصر الالماني ڤيلهلم الثاني وحاشيته اثناء زيارته للقدس. وظلت المدينه تحت الحكم العثماني حتى هزمت الدوله العثمانيه في الحرب العالميه الاولى.\n\nالانتداب البريطاني وحرب سنه 1948\nسقطت القدس بيد الجيش البريطاني بقياده الفريق اول ادموند النبي في سنه 1917، بعد ان تقهقر الجيش العثماني مهزومًا امامهم، وفي سنه 1922 منحت عصبه الامم بريطانيا حق الانتداب على فلسطين واماره شرق الاردن والعراق، واصبحت القدس عاصمه فلسطين تحت الانتداب البريطاني.\nدخلت المدينه في عهد جديد كان من ابرز سماته زياده اعداد المهاجرين اليهود اليها خاصه بعد وعد بلفور الذي اصدرته الحكومه البريطانيه، وقد اظهرت بعض احصائيات تلك الفتره ان عدد سكان المدينه ارتفع من 52,000 نسمه عام 1922 الى 165,000 نسمه عام 1948 بفعل هجره اليهود. ادّى ازدياد عدد اليهود في فلسطين عمومًا والقدس خصوصًا، وشرائهم للاراضي ومساعده البريطانيين لهم، ادّى الى استياء المقدسيين من مسلمين ومسيحيين، فقامت اعمال شغب في سنتيّ 1920 و1929، وعُرفت الاخيره بثوره البراق، قُتل خلالها عدد من اليهود. عمل البريطانيون على اخماد هذه الثورات، وساهموا في جعل اليهود يستقرون في المدينه عن طريق بنائهم لاحياء سكنيّه كامله في شمال وغرب المدينه، وانشائهم لعدد من مؤسسات التعليم العالي، مثل الجامعه العبريه.\nاحيلت قضيه القدس الى الامم المتحده بعد الحرب العالميه الثانيه، فاصدرت الهيئه الدوليه قرارها في 29 نوفمبر سنه 1947 بتدويل القدس تحت رعايتها واشرافها. وجاء في القرار انه سوف يُطبّق طيله 10 سنوات، ويشمل مدينه بيت لحم، وانه بعد هذه الفتره سيتم اجراء استفتاء عام لتحديد نظام الحكم الذي يرغب اغلبيه سكان المدينه بتطبيقه عليهم. الا ان تطبيق هذا القرار لم يُكتب له ان يتم، فبعد ان اعلنت بريطانيا في عام 1948 انهاء الانتداب في فلسطين وسحب قواتها، استغلت العصابات اليهوديه حاله الفراغ السياسي والعسكري واعلنت قيام الدوله الاسرائيليه، فثار العرب عمومًا والفلسطينيون خصوصًا واعلنوا الحرب على اسرائيل، فهوجمت المدينه من قبل الجيش العربي والثوّار الفلسطينيين، وقُتل عدد من الاسرائيليين في هذا الهجوم وتم اسر البعض الاخر. كذلك هاجم القنّاصه العرب القسم الغربي من المدينه.\n\nالتقسيم والضم\nكان من نتائج حرب سنه 1948 بين العرب والاسرائيليين ان قُسمت القدس الى شطرين: الجزء الغربي الخاضع لاسرائيل، والجزء الشرقي الخاضع للاردن. وفي شهر نوفمبر من نفس السنه، اقيمت منطقه عازله بين الجزئين، حيث قابل قائد القوّات الاسرائيليه في القدس، موشيه دايان، نظيره الاردني عبد الله التل في احدى منازل حيّ مصراره بالقدس، وقاما بتعليم الحدود الفاصله بين شطريّ المدينه، حيث لوّنت حصه اسرائيل باللون الاحمر وحصه الاردن باللون الاخضر. نجم هذا اللقاء عن رسم خريطه لحدود غير رسميّه بين الطرفين المتحاربين، لكنها اخذت بعين الاعتبار عند توقيع اتفاقيه الهدنه بين اسرائيل ولبنان ومصر والاردن وسوريا سنه 1949، والتي اتفقت فيها تلك الدول على وقف اطلاق النار والتزام الاسرائيليين بالبقاء ضمن هذه الحدود لحين ايجاد حل سلمي للنزاع. كذلك نصّت هذه الاتفاقيه على تقسيم القدس على ان يبقى جبل المشارف في يد اسرائيل على الرغم من انه يقع في القسم الشرقي، بوصفه جيب داخلي. بناءً على هذا، اقيمت الحواجز الاسمنتيّه والاسلاك الشائكه في وسط المدينه ومرّت بالقرب من باب الخليل في الجانب الغربي من البلده القديمه، واُنشات نقطه عبور شمال الاخيره عُرفت بمعبر ماندلباوم. استمرت بعض المناوشات العسكريه بين الاردن واسرائيل بين الحين والاخر على الرغم من اتفاق وقف اطلاق النار، الا انها لم تكن ذات اهميه تُذكر غالبًا. كان داود بن گوريون، رئيس وزراء اسرائيل، قد اعلن في 3 ديسمبر 1948 ان القدس الغربيه عاصمه للدوله الاسرائيليه الوليده، وفي سنه 1950 اعلن الاردن رسميًا خضوع القدس الشرقيه للسياده الاردنيه، وقد اعترفت المملكه المتحده وباكستان بهذا الضم، فيما لم تعترف دول اخرى بهذا الامر بحجه ان القدس الشرقيه خضعت للاردن بحكم الامر الواقع وليس بشكل رسمي، ويشكك البعض ان كانت باكستان قد اعترفت بضم الاردن للقدس الشرقيه حتى.\nخضعت اغلبيه المواقع المقدسه في القدس للسياده الاردنيه، بما ان اغلبها يقع في القسم الشرقي من المدينه، فاجرت الحكومه الاردنيه عدد من الاصلاحات والترميمات لقبه الصخره والمسجد الاقصى، وسمحت للمسيحيين الاجانب بزياره المقدسات المسيحيه شرط خضوعهم للرقابه، اما اليهود فلم يُسمح لهم بدخول المدينه لاعتبارات سياسيه، حيث كانت الحكومه تخشى ان يعمل بعضهم في الجاسوسيه لصالح اسرائيل.\n\nخاض العرب واسرائيل حربًا اخرى في سنه 1967 انتصرت فيها الاخيره، وقامت بالسيطره على القدس الشرقيه، وكان من نتيجه ذلك ان عاد اليهود ليدخلوا دون اي قيود الى اماكنهم المقدسه، كذلك ازيلت القيود المفروضه على المسيحيين الغربيين، اما المسجد الاقصى وقبه الصخره فاستمرا خاضعين للاوقاف الاسلاميه. قام الاسرائيليون بهدم حاره المغاربه بعد دخولهم المدينه، بما انها كانت تواجه حائط البراق الذي يتعبّد اليهود عنده، ولكي يجعلوا من الموقع ساحه لرفع الصلاه اليهوديه. قامت اسرائيل بتوسيع حدود المدينه بعد انتهاء الحرب وذلك عبر بناء عدد من الاحياء السكنيه والمستعمرات اليهوديه شرق الخط الاخضر، وقد اقدمت اسرائيل منذ سنه 1967 بمحاولات عديده تهدف الى تهويد المناطق التي احتلتها بعد الحرب، وذلك عبر وسائل عديده، منها التركيز الاعلامي على اهميه المواقع الاثريه العبرانيه في المدينه.\nقوبل ضم اسرائيل للقدس الشرقيه بالاستنكار الدولي، وبعد ان اصدرت اسرائيل قانون اساس اعتبرت فيه القدس الموحده عاصمه ابديه للبلاد، اصدر مجلس امن الامم المتحده القرار رقم 478 الذي نص على ان اسرائيل خرقت قانونًا دوليًا وطالب جميع الدول الاعضاء بسحب ما تبقى من سفاراتها من القدس. ما زالت مساله القدس تُشكل قضيه محوريه في الصراع العربي الاسرائيلي، خصوصًا مع اقرار الحكومه الاسرائيليه بناء وحدات استيطانيه جديده على الدوام في حارات واحياء في البلده القديمه يسكنها مسلمون وتحوي مقدسات اسلاميه، في سبيل رفع عدد اليهود في القدس الشرقيه، الا ان علماء الدين المسلمون وعدد من المؤرخين العرب يزعمون ان اليهود ليس لهم اي حق في المدينه لاسباب متنوعه، منها ان حائط البراق الذي بُني منذ حوالي 2,500 سنه كان جزءًا من مسجد سليمان الذي تسميه اليهود هيكل سليمان. طالب الفلسطينيون وما زالوا بالقدس الشرقيه عاصمه للدوله الفلسطينيه المستقبليه، لذا لطالما كانت حدود المدينه موضع نقاش وجدال في المحادثات الثنائيه بين السلطه الفلسطينيه واسرائيل. اقام بعض الاشخاص من الفلسطينيين والاسرائيليين الراغبين بالسلام نصبًا تذكاريًا مصنوع من الاسلحه القديمه الباليه، يواجه سور القدس القديم ونقشوا عليه عبارات بالعربيه والعبريه مقتبسه من سفر اشعياء.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع مدينه القدس في وسط فلسطين تقريبًا شرق البحر المتوسط، على رعن هضبه من هضاب جبال الخليل، التي تضم عددًا من الجبال بدورها، وهي: جبل الزيتون او جبل الطور شرق المدينه، جبل المشارف ويقع الى الشمال الغربي للمدينه، ويُقال له ايضًا «جبل المشهد»، وقد اقيمت فوقه في سنه 1925 الجامعه العبريه، ومستشفى هداسا الجامعي في سنه 1939، جبل صهيون ويقع الى الجنوب الغربي وتكوّن البلده القديمه جزءًا كبيرًا منه وتمر اسوارها من فوقه، جبل المكبر الذي سُمي بهذا الاسم عندما دخل عمر بن الخطاب القدس وكبّر على متنه، بالاضافه الى جبل النبي صموئيل، وجبل ابو غنيم. ترتفع القدس عن سطح البحر المتوسط نحو 750 مترًا (2,460 قدمًا)، وعن سطح البحر الميت نحو 1150 مترًا (3,770 قدمًا). بالاضافه الى جبال القدس فان هناك ثلاثه اوديه تحيط بها وهي: وادي سلوان او وادي جهنم واسمه القديم «وادي قدرون»، الوادي او الواد، وادي الجوز، ونبع ام الدرج.\nكانت القدس محاطه بغابات من اشجار الجوز الزيتون الصنوبر منذ القدم، الا ان الحروب والاستغلال البشري كان لها وقعٌ مدمّر عليها، فاختفت معظم هذه الغابات، وقد اثّر ذلك على تماسك التربه، فاضطر المزارعون الى تشييد المدرّجات الزراعيه على عدد من السفوح لمنع تاكلها وانجراف تربتها. شكّل شح المياه مشكله للمقدسيين منذ العهود الاولى لاستيطان المدينه، فقاموا بتشييد عدد من القناطر والقنوات لجرّ مياه الانهار، اضافه لعدد من البرك والابار لجمع ماء الامطار، وما زال البعض منها موجودًا بالبلده القديمه. ومن ابرز ابار المدينه بئر ايوب، نسبه الى النبي ايوب، وهذه البئر هي التي يؤمن المسلمون انها ذُكرت في القران بسوره ص، حيث جاء: ﴿ارْكُضْ بِرِجْلِكَ هَذَا مُغْتَسَلٌ بَارِدٌ وَشَرَابٌ﴾، كذلك من ابرز بركها او عيونها، العين المعروفه بعين سلوان، وهي احدى العيون الجاريه التي يؤمن المسلمون انها ذُكرت في القران ايضًا في سوره الرحمن: ﴿فِيهِمَا عَيْنَانِ تَجْرِيَانِ﴾. قال مجير الدين الحنبلي عن القدس في نهايه القرن التاسع سنه 900 هـ: \n\nتبعد القدس نحو 60 كيلومترًا (37 ميلاً) عن البحر المتوسط، وحوالي 35 كيلومترًا (22 ميلاً) عن البحر الميت، و250 كيلومتر (155 ميلاً) عن البحر الاحمر، وتبعد عن عمّان 88 كيلومتر (55 ميلاً)، وعن بيروت 388 كيلومتر (241 ميلاً)، وعن دمشق 290 كيلومتر (180 ميلاً). اما المدن والبلدات المجاوره للقدس فتشمل: بيت لحم وبيت جالا جنوبًا، ابو ديس ومستوطنه معاليه ادوميم شرقًا، مڤاسرت صهيون غربًا، ورام الله ومستوطنه گفعات زئيف شمالاً.\n\nمناطق القدس\nتمتد اراضي بلديه القدس اليوم لتشمل مناطق شاسعه كانت في السابق قرى او ضواحي للمدينه، فتشمل حدود البلديه كل من: بيت حنينا، كفر عقب، شعفاط، التل الفرنسي، جبل المشارف، الشيخ جراح، وادي الجوز، جبل الزيتون، البلده القديمه، سلوان، العيسويه، راس العمود، ابو الطور، جبل المكبر، صور باهر، ام طوبا، جبل ابو غنيم، بيت صفافا والولجه، قائمه المدن والقرى في فلسطين التاريخيه.\nمن جهه اخرى، اقامت اسرائيل العديد من المستوطنات، كما قامت بضم مستوطنات قديمه اخرى خارج حدود البلديه بعد احتلالها للقدس الشرقيه عام 1967 وبنائها لجدار الفصل عام 2002، والذي عزل العديد من البلدات العربيه عن القدس، كالعيزريه، ابو ديس، الرام، حزما، عناتا، السواحره الشرقيه، بيت اكسا، الشيخ سعد وقلنديا - حيث مطار القدس الدولي، والتي من المفترض ان تشكل الامتداد الطبيعي لتوسع الاحياء العربيه في المدينه مستقبلاً. وهذه المستوطنات هي: مستوطنه عطروت، مستوطنه نيڤيه يعقوب، مستوطنه بيسغات زئيف، مستوطنه رامات اشكول، مستوطنه غيلو، مستوطنه هماطوس ومستوطنه ناليبوت مزراح.\nالقدس الغربيه\nاقدمت اسرائيل بعد قيامها عام 1948، على تدمير معظم القرى الواقعه غرب القدس، من اهمها: المالحه، دير ياسين، عين كارم، لفتا، والقسطل. واقامت مكانها العديد من المستوطنات التي اصبحت تشكل فيما بعد مناطق القدس الغربيه، وهي: گفعات شاؤول، بيت هيكرم، جبل هرتزل، كريات هيوفيل، عميق زيفائيم، يمين موشيه، ربحاميا، نحلاؤوت، محانيه يهودا، مئه سيعاريم، روميما وگفعات رام.\n\nالحياه البريه والغابات\nيقع في محيط القدس عده غابات ومناطق بريه مثل وادي الغزال، تقع هذه المنطقه بوسط القدس بالقرب من حي «گفعات مردخاي» اليهودي،\nوهي ارض مكشوفه تبلغ مساحتها 260 دونمًا. اُطلق هذا الاسم على الوادي كون ما يُقارب من 17 غزالاً جبليًا تتخذ منه موطنًا ولا تستطيع مغادرته لاحاطه المدينه به من مختلف الجوانب. كان متعهدو العقارات والمقاولون قد خططوا لتحويل المنطقه الى منطقه سكنيه، لكن محبي الطبيعه وجمعيه حمايه البيئه في اسرائيل استطاعت ايقاف هذا الامر، وارغام السلطات المختصه على النظر في مساله حمايه الموقع.\n\nالمناخ\nتتميز القدس بمناخ البحر الابيض المتوسط (تصنيف كوبن للمناخ: Csa)، مع صيف حار جاف، وشتاء مُعتدل البروده رطب. تتساقط الثلوج عادهً مره او مرتين خلال الشتاء، على الرغم من ان المدينه تختبر تساقطًا كثيفًا للثلوج مره كل ثلاث الى اربع سنوات، في المتوسط، مع تراكم قصير العمر.\nيُعتبر يناير ابرد شهور السنه، بمتوسط درجه حراره 9.1 درجه °مئويه (48.4 درجه °فهرنهايت)؛ يُعد شهري يوليو واغسطس الاكثر سخونه، حيث يبلغ متوسط درجه الحراره 24.2 درجه °مئويه (75.6 درجه °فهرنهايت)، وعاده ما تكون اشهر الصيف جافه. يبلغ متوسط هطول الامطار السنوي حوالي 537 مليمترًا (21 انشًا)، وذلك في الفتره الممتده بين شهريّ اكتوبر ومايو، اما الاشهر الاخرى فينعدم فيها تساقط الامطار غالبًا. تساقط الثلوج ليس شائعًا، لكن تساقط الثلوج بغزاره يعتبر نادرًا. تلقت القدس اكثر من 30 سم (12 بوصه) من الثلج في 13 ديسمبر 2013، والتي شلت المدينه تقريبًا. مع متوسط درجات حراره في الصيف مماثله للسواحل، فان التاثير البحري من البحر الابيض المتوسط قوي، لا سيما بالنظر الى ان القدس تقع على خط عرض مشابه للصحاري الحاره غير البعيده الى الشرق.\nكانت اعلى درجه حراره مُسجله في القدس 44.4 درجه °مئويه (111.9 درجه °فهرنهايت) في 28 و30 اغسطس 1881، وكانت ادنى درجه حراره مُسجله −6.7 درجه °مئويه (19.9 درجه °فهرنهايت) في 25 يناير 1907.\nياتي معظم تلوث الهواء في القدس من حركه مرور السيارات. لم يتم بناء العديد من الشوارع الرئيسيه في القدس لاستيعاب هذا الحجم الكبير من حركه المرور، مما ادى الى ازدحام حركه المرور والمزيد من انبعاثات اول اكسيد الكربون في الهواء. تُساهم انبعاثات المصانع بنسبه ضئيله من تلوّث الهواء بالمدينه، الا انه يمكن لتلك الصادره عن المصانع الواقعه على ساحل البحر المتوسط ان تتجه شرقًا ناحيه القدس وتُشكل ضبخانًا فوقها.\n\nالقرى\nقرى القدس عديده وكثيره فقد اختلف التحاق بعض القرى لمدينه القدس وفقًا للتغيرات التاريخيه التي مرت بها المدينه. كان اخر تغيير لحدود مدينه القدس الاداريه في يونيو سنه 1967 بموجب قرار اصدرته الحكومه الاسرائيليه بعد احتلال الضفه الغربيه من الاردن. نص هذا القرار على ضم 70,4 كيلومترات مربعه الى منطقه البلديه المقدسيه الاسرائيليه وفرض القانون الاسرائيلي عليها. كانت 6,4 كيلومترات مربعه من المساحه المضمومه تابعه للبلديه المقدسيه الاردنيه قبل حرب سنه 1967، اما الباقي فكان من اراضي بعض القرى المجاوره للقدس. اقدم الاسرائيليون على هدم عدد من القرى الفلسطينيه وبناء قرىً ومستوطنات جديده على انقاضها، وقد سمحت الحكومه في وقت لاحق لبعض المهجرين من الفلسطينيين بالعوده الى قراهم، فاقاموا بجانب المستوطنات قرىً جديده. حاز سكان المنطقه المضمومه على مكانه «مقيم دائم» في اسرائيل، دون ان يحصلوا على المواطنه، اما القرى التي بقيت خارج حدود القدس الاداريه وسكانها، فيخضعون لسيطره الحكم العسكري او لسيطره السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه. وكانت الحكومه الاسرائيليه قد اصدرت قانون املاك الغائب عام 1950، الذي منح اسرائيل صفه الوصي على على املاك الفلسطينيين الغائبين، واعطاها الحق في الاستيلاء عليها وادارتها. من القرى العربيه التي كانت بجوار القدس من جانبها الغربي قبل حرب سنه 1948 لم تبق الا ثلاثًا: ابو غوش (اكبرها)، عين رافه، وعين نقوبا. تعتبر هذه القرى الثلاثه اليوم تجمعات عربيه اسرائيليه وسكانها ذوي جنسيه اسرائيليه. ومن قرى القدس الاخرى: اشوع، البريج، بيت ام الميس، بيت عطاب، بيت محسير، جرش، خربه العمور، خربه اللوز، دير الشيخ، وغيرها.\n\nالتركيبه السكانيّه\nاشارت الاحصاءات الاسرائيليه الرسميه الصادره نهايه عام 2000 الى انّ تعداد السكان في المدينه ارتفع بنسبه 2% من اجمالي السكان البالغ 646,3 الف نسمه، بينهم 436,7 الف يهودي بنسبه 67,6%، في حين بلغ عدد السكان العرب 209,5 الاف عربي بنسبه 32.4%. وقد تبيّن في احصائيه اخرى من نفس السنه ان نسبه السكان من اليهود تتراجع تدريجيًا بينما نسبه العرب في ازدياد مطّرد، ويرجع ذلك الى نسبه الولادات الاعلى عند العرب والى هجره البعض من اليهود الى مدن وبلدان اخرى. كذلك افادت نفس الدراسه ان حوالي 9% من جمهره البلده القديمه البالغه 32,488 نسمه كانوا يهودًا. بلغت نسبه الكثافه السكانيّه بالمدينه في نهايه عام 2005 حوالي 5,750.4 نسمه في الكيلومتر المربّع (14,893.5 نسمه/ميل مربّع)، وفي نهايه سنه 2006 اظهرت احصائيه اعدّتها مؤسسه اسرائيليه للدراسات حول مدينه القدس ان عدد سكان القدس بلغ 733 الف شخص بينهم 481 الف يهودي و252 الف فلسطيني يعيشون خصوصًا في الاحياء الشرقيه من المدينه. وفي شهر ديسمبر من سنه 2007، وصل عدد سكان القدس الى 747,600 نسمه، 64% منهم يهود و32% مسلمين و2% مسيحيين.\n\nيخوض الفلسطينيون والاسرائيليون حربًا ديمغرافيّه في القدس، حيث يسعى كل طرف الى زياده عدد السكان المنتمين الى عرقيته ليضمن هيمنته على المدينه، وتعمل الحكومه الاسرائيليه - كما تقول الدكتوره ساره هيرشكوبيتس رئيسه قسم التخطيط الاستراتيجي في بلديه القدس - على الا تتعدى نسبه العرب بالمدينه 28%. وتحاول الحكومه الاسرائيليه زياده عدد اليهود في المدينه بطرق عده، منها على سبيل المثال العمل على احلال اليهود محلّ العرب الذين هدّمت منازلهم بحجّه البناء دون تصريح. وتشير احصائيات بيت الشرق لعام 1999 في هذا الصدد الى هدم اكثر من الفيْ منزل منذ عام 1967، مما خلق ظروفاً صعبه للفلسطينيين حيث يسكن معظمهم في منازل مكتظه. ومن الوسائل الاخرى التي تتّخذها اسرائيل لاجبار المقدسيّين على الهجره من القدس، عدم منحهم تصاريح بناء الا فيما ندر، وتسهيل بناء المنازل لليهود المهاجرين. وفي سنه 2005، قدم المدينه 2,850 مهاجر يهودي جديد من الولايات المتحده وفرنسا ومن بعض دول الاتحاد السوڤيتي السابق، وبنهايه السنه ذاتها تبيّن ان 16,000 من السكان غادر المدينه، الا ان جمهره المدينه ما زالت في ازدياد بفضل ارتفاع نسبه الانجاب بين الاهالي العرب واليهود الحريديه. يصل معدل الخصوبه الكلي في القدس الى 4.02، وهو اعلى من ذاك الخاص بتل ابيب (1.98) والمعدل الوطني حتى، الذي يصل الى 2.90.\n\nبلغت الزياده الصافيه للسكان في سنه 2000، بعد حساب الولادات والوفيات والمهاجرين من والى المدينه، 12600 نسمه، كان نصيب اليهود منها 2900 نسمه، في حين بلغت الزياده العربيه 9700. وبهذا كانت نسبه نمو السكان اليهود في القدس هي 0.7% بينما كانت عند السكان العرب 4.7%. وفي سنه 2005 ازداد عدد السكان بحوالي 13,000 نسمه، اي قرابه 1.8%، وهي نسبه مشابهه لنسبه معدّل النمو السكاني في اسرائيل في ذلك العام، الا ان ما يميزها هو التباين في التركيبه السكانيّه والعرقيّه، فقرابه 31% من الجمهره اليهوديه تالفت من اولاد دون سن الخامسه عشر، بالمقابل فان هذه النسبه وصلت لحوالي 42% عند السكان العرب، ويتوافق ذلك مع الدراسات التي اظهرت تراجع عدد اليهود في القدس خلال العقود الاربع الماضيه، واتجاه معظمهم الى المدن الساحليه والضواحي.\nعادت نسبه اليهود الحريديه في المدينه الى الارتفاع بحلول عام 2009، حيث تبيّن في احدى الاحصائيات ان 59,900 تلميذ من اصل 150,100، او 40% منهم، يطلبون العلم في المدارس الرسميّه العلمانيّه والدينيّه على حد سواء، بينما 90,200 تلميذ او 60% من المجموع الاصلي، يتلقون دراستهم في مدارس حريديه خاصه.\nيرى العديد من الاسرائيليين ان القدس مدينه فقيره تمزقها النزاعات السياسيه والدينيه، لذا فهم يفضلون سكن مدن اخرى اكثر امانًا وغنى، وبالمقابل تستقطب المدينه عددًا كبيرًا من الفلسطينيين من سكّان الضفه الغربيه وقطاع غزه، كونها تقدم لهم فرص عمل وخدمات صحيه اكبر من تلك المتاحه في مدنهم وقراهم. شجّع الزعماء الفلسطينيون والعرب السكان الفلسطينيين عبر السنين على البقاء في المدينه لتاكيد حقهم بالمطالبه بها، وقد فعل البعض منهم هذا.\n\nمخيم شعفاط\nتاسس مخيم شعفاط للاجئين في عام 1965، اي بعد اكثر من عقد واحد على تاسيس كافه المخيمات الرسميه الاخرى في الضفه الغربيه، وذلك فوق ارض مساحتها 0,2 كيلومتر مربع شمال القدس. وقد تاسس مخيم شعفاط بعد ان تم اغلاق مخيم المعسكر في المدينه القديمه للقدس بسبب سوء الظروف الصحيه فيه.\nوتعود اصول اللاجئين في مخيم المعسكر والذين رُحلوا الى شعفاط الى 55 قريه تابعه لمناطق القدس واللد ويافا والرمله. ومثل باقي مخيمات الضفه الغربيه، فقد تاسس المخيم فوق قطعه من الارض استاجرتها وكاله غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين من الحكومه الاردنيه.\nويُعد مخيم شعفاط المخيم الوحيد في الضفه الغربيه الذي يقع ضمن الحدود البلديه للقدس. ولذلك، فان اللاجئين فيه يحق لهم الحصول على هويات مدنيه تابعه للقدس، الامر الذي يضمن لهم حقوق الاقامه في القدس ويجعلهم مؤهلين للحصول على بعض الخدمات الاجتماعيه الاسرائيليه، بما في ذلك الرعايه الصحيه.\nوفي الوقت الذي تبين سجلات الاونروا الرسميه ان عدد اللاجئين المسجلين في المخيم يصل الى حوالي 11,000 لاجئ، الا انه من المرجح ان يبلغ عدد اللاجئين فيه اكثر من 18,000. ويُقدر ان حوالي 4,000 لاجئ قد انتقلوا الى المخيم في السنوات الاخيره لتجنب فقدان حقوق الاقامه في القدس. ويعمل حوالي 70% من سكان المخيم في القطاع الخاص الاسرائيلي.\n\nتهويد القدس\nتتّبع اسرائيل سياسه دمج المستوطنات لاستيعاب اكبر عدد ممكن من اليهود داخل القدس، فعلى سبيل المثال دمجت الحكومه الاسرائيليه مستوطنه گفعات زئيف ومعاليه ادوميم ومناطق الخط الاخضر لاحتواء حوالي 30 الف مستوطن جديد داخل المدينه. كما بنت 142 الف شقه في القطاع اليهودي لزياده حجم السكان فيها. تفيد احدى تقارير البنك الدولي ان عدد مخالفات البناء في الفتره الممتده بين عاميّ 1996 و2000، كان اكبر باربع مرّات ونصف في الاحياء اليهوديه، وان عمليات الهدم في القدس الغربيه كانت اقل باربع مرّات من تلك الحاصله في القدس الشرقيه؛ كذلك افاد التقرير ان السلطات الاسرائيليه كانت تمنح الفلسطينيين اذونًا بالبناء اقل بكثير من الاذون التي تمنحها لليهود، وان المخالفين الفلسطينيين تُزال مخالفاتهم بنسبه اكبر من مخالفات اليهود. حصلت بعض المؤسسات اليهوديه على اذن من الحكومه الاسرائيليه خلال السنوات القليله الماضيه، يسمح لها بتشييد المباني والمعالم على الاراضي المتنازع عليها، من شاكله «حديقه الملك سليمان» المخطط انشاؤها في قريه سلوان بمدينه داود، والتي يُشكل العرب حوالي 60% من سكانها، وفي مقبره «مامن الله». اطلق معارضو هذه الخطوات المُتخذه من قبل الحكومه الاسرائيليه مصطلح «تهويد القدس» على هذه الاجراءات، كونها تصب في مصلحه اليهود دون الفلسطينيين.\n\nالقدس الرسميه\nالبلديّه\nتاسس المجلس البلدي لمدينه القدس في سنه 1863 ابّان الحكم العثماني، وقد انقسم هذا المجلس الى مجلسين عند تقسيم المدينه. تولت امانه القدس الاهتمام بالقدس العربيه بين نكبه فلسطين واحتلال القدس في حرب 1967.\nيتالّف مجلس بلديّه القدس الاسرائيلي اليوم من 31 عضوًا منتخبًا على راسهم رئيس البلديّه، الذي يُنتخب لخمس سنوات، ويتمتع بحق تعيين سته مفوضين بلديين لينوبوا عنه، وهؤلاء الى جانب رئيس البلديه يتلقون رواتبهم كامله من الحكومه الاسرائيليه، اما باقي الاعضاء فيُعتبر عملهم تطوعيًا. يعقد مجلس بلديه القدس معظم اجتماعاته بصفه سريّه، عدا جلسه واحده في كل شهر تكون علنيّه. تُشكل الاحزاب الدينيه عصبه قويّه داخل مجلس البلديه، حيث تسيطر غالبًا على معظم المقاعد. يقع دار بلديه القدس ومكتب رئيسها في ساحه الصفراء في شارع يافا. يتكوّن مجمّع البلديه، الذي افتتح في سنه 1993، من مبنيين حديثيّ البناء الى جانب عشره مبان قديمه مجدده، تحيط بساحه عامّه واسعه. تتبع المدينه محافظه القدس وتُشكّل عاصمتها. اضافه الى ذلك، تقوم مؤسسه الاقصى لاعمار المقدسات بصيانه وترميم ورعايه المؤسسات والمباني الاسلاميه في القدس.\nقامت بلديه القدس الغربيه في سنه 1949 باجراء مسابقه لتصميم علم للشطر الغربي من المدينه، ففاز تصميم تضمن رسمًا لخطين عريضين باللون الازرق يرمزان الى شال الصلاه اليهوديه، على خلفيه بيضاء يقع في وسطهما شعار المدينه. وجعلت اسرائيل التصميم الاسرائيلي شعارًا للمدينه بشطريها بعد حرب سنه 1967 عندما ضمت القدس الشرقيه، على الرغم من ان السكان العرب والمجتمع الدولي لم يتعرف بذلك، لكن العلم والشعار بقيا بحكم الامر الواقع. صُمم شعار القدس ما بين سنتيّ 1950 و1951، وهو يُظهر اسدًا جامحًا يُرمز به الى اسد يهودا، شعار القبيله اليهوديه القديمه، محاطًا باغصنه زيتون، وفي الخلفيه رُسم حائط البراق. اما السلطه الفلسطينيه فلم تنشئ شعار ولا علم للمدينه.\n\nرؤساء البلديه\nتوالى على رئاسه بلديه القدس عدد من اعيان المدينه، كان اولهم «موسى العلمي». تولّى اليهود رئاسه البلديه لاوّل مره في سنه 1937، وذلك عندما فاز «دانيال استر» برئاسه البلديه بدعم من حكومه الانتداب البريطانيه. وعندما انقسمت القدس الى شطرين، اصبحت هناك بلديتين: بلديه القدس الشرقيه ورئيسها عربي، وبلديه القدس الغربيه ويراسها اسرائيلي. اما اوّل رؤساء بلديه القدس الشرقيه فهو «انور الخطيب»، واوّل رؤساء بلديه القدس الغربيه هو الحاكم العسكري «دوڤ يوسف». وعندما ضمّت اسرائيل القدس الشرقيه بعد حرب حزيران سنه 1967، اسست بلديه «اورشليم القدس» وتولّى رئاستها «ثيودور كولك». يشغل نير بركات منصب رئيس بلديه اورشليم القدس حاليًا، ويراس زكي الغول امانه القدس الشرقيه، بما ان السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه واغلب دول العالم لا تعتبر ضم الاخيره قانونياً.\n\nالوضع السياسي\nبعد ان اصدرت هيئه الامم المتحده قرارها القاضي بتقسيم فلسطين في سنه 1947، نصّت على وجوب تدويل القدس تحت اشرافها ورقابتها، وقد سارع القاده اليهود الى قبول هذا الامر نظرًا لانه يحقق مطامحهم في اقامه دوله لهم، بينما عارضه الزعماء العرب ورفضوا اي تقسيم يُخطط اجراؤه في فلسطين. انقسمت المدينه الى شطرين بعد حرب سنه 1948 بين العرب واسرائيل، واحتلت الاخيره القسم الغربي، فيما سيطر الاردن على القسم الشرقي. اعتبرت معظم الدول، وما زالت، ان وضع القدس ينبغي ان يُحدد كما ورد في قرار التقسيم، لذا فان اغلبها لا يعترف بالقدس عاصمه لاسرائيل.\nبعد ان اعلن دافيد بن غوريون، اوّل رئيس وزراء لاسرائيل، ان القدس الغربيه عاصمه البلاد، اتخذت جميع الهيئات الحكوميه الاسرائيليه، من قضائيه وتشريعيه وتنفيذيه، من المدينه مقرًا لها، عدا وزاره الدفاع، التي لا تزال تتخذ من منطقه كرياه بوسط تل ابيب مركزًا لها. سيطرت اسرائيل على المدينه بشطريها مباشرهً بعد حرب سنه 1967، وجعلت منها جزءًا من العاصمه بحكم الامر الواقع، على الرغم من معارضه المجتمع الدولي لهذا الامر. لا تزال هويّه القدس كعاصمه «ابديّه» لاسرائيل تُشكّل موضع جدل كبير في المجتمع الدولي، فعلى الرغم من ان بعض الدول فتحت قنصليات لها في المدينه، فان جميع السفارات موجوده خارجها، ومعظمها في تل ابيب. وبسبب عدم الاعتراف بالقدس كعاصمه لاسرائيل، فان معظم الصحف العالميه والمحليه تصف اعلانات الحكومه الاسرائيليه بانها «صادره عن تل ابيب».\nاصدر مجلس امن الامم المتحده القرار رقم 478 بتاريخ 20 اغسطس سنه 1980، الذي نصّ على ان قانون الاساس الذي اصدرته اسرائيل واعتبرت فيه القدس عاصمه ابديه لها، قانونًا «فاسدًا باطلاً وينبغي الغاؤه فورًا»، واقتُرح ان تقوم الدول الاعضاء في هذا المجلس بسحب كل هيئاتها الدبلوماسيه من المدينه حتى تذعن اسرائيل للقرار الدولي، وقد استجابت معظم الدول ذات السفارات المتبقيه في القدس لهذا الامر، وقامت بنقل مراكز سفاراتها الى تل ابيب، كما فعلت غيرها من الدول قبيل صدور القرار رقم 478، وكنتيجه لهذا الامر، فرغت القدس من السفارات الاجنبيه، لكن بعضًا منها اتخذ من احدى ضواحيها، وهي «مڤاسرت صهيون»، مقرًا لها، كذلك استمرت 4 قنصليات موجوده بالمدينه. قرر الكونغرس الامريكي نقل مقر السفاره الامريكيه من تل ابيب الى القدس في سنه 1995، وذلك بعد اصدار «قانون السفاره في القدس» (بالانگليزيه: Jerusalem Embassy Act)، الا ان بيل كلنتون، رئيس الولايات المتحده انذاك، استمر بتاجيل التوقيع على هذا القرار الى ان انتهت ولايته، وعندها قال الرئيس الذي خلفه، وهو جورج بوش الابن، قال بان قرارات الكونغرس المتعلقه بوضع القدس ليست الزاميه والهدف منها ابداء النصح والمشوره فقط، فلم يُقدم على توقيع القرار واستمرت السفاره الامريكيه موجوده في تل ابيب. قال امين عام الامم المتحده، بان كي مون، في 28 اكتوبر سنه 2009، بان القدس يجب ان تكون عاصمهً لكل من فلسطين واسرائيل كي يتحقق السلام العادل والشامل.\n\nتقع في القدس ابرز المؤسسات الحكوميه الاسرائيليه، بما فيها البرلمان او الكنيست، والمحكمه العليا، والمقر الرسمي لرئيس الجمهوريه ورئيس الوزراء. وقبيل اعلان قيام «دوله» اسرائيل، كانت القدس عاصمهً اداريه للاراضي الشاميّه الخاضعه للانتداب البريطاني، اي تلك التي تشمل اليوم اراضي السلطه الفلسطينيه واسرائيل والاردن. كانت القدس الغربيه عاصمهً لاسرائيل من سنه 1949 حتى سنه 1967، الا ان دول العالم لم تعترف بهذا الامر بما ان قرار الامم المتحده رقم 194 كان قد نصّ على تدويل المدينه. بعد ان خضعت المدينه بشطريها لاسرائيل بعد حرب سنه 1967، اعلنت حكومه ليڤي اشكول تطبيق القانون الاسرائيلي على القدس الشرقيه وامتداد نطاق اختصاص القضاء الاسرائيلي اليها، لكنها وافقت على خضوع منطقه المسجد الاقصى وقبه الصخره لوزاره الاوقاف الاردنيه. امرت السلطات الاسرائيليه باقفال بيت الشرق، وهو مقرّ منظمه التحرير الفلسطينيه، في سنه 1988 لاسباب امنيّه، وفي سنه 1992 اعيد افتتاح البيت بصفته مضافه. نصّت اتفاقيه اوسلو على ان الوضع النهائي للقدس يجب ان يتحدد عن طريق مفاوضات مع السلطه الفلسطينيه، التي تعتبر القدس الشرقيه عاصمه لدوله فلسطينيه مستقبليه، وقد قال الرئيس الفلسطيني محمود عبّاس ان ايه مفاوضات لا تتضمن الاعتراف بالقدس الشرقيه عاصمه لفلسطين ستكون غير مقبوله. في السادس من ديسمبر 2017 قرر الرئيس الامريكي دونالد ترامب الاعتراف بالقدس عاصمه لاسرائيل ونقل سفاره الولايات المتحده الى القدس.\n\nالاهميه الدينيه\nالقدس مدينه ذات اهميه دينيه كبرى عند اتباع الديانات الابراهيميه الثلاث: اليهود والمسيحيون والمسلمون. اظهرت احدى الاحصائيات من سنه 2000 ان القدس تحوي حاليًا 1204 كنسات، 158 كنيسه، و73 مسجدًا، والبعض من دور العباده هذه يُعتبر من بين اكثر المواقع تقديسًا عند اتباع هذه الديانه او تلك، ان لم يكن اقدسها في بعض الاحيان، لذا فقد كان انتهاك حُرمه احدى هذه الدور من بين الاسباب التي ادّت دومًا الى حصول نزاعات كبيره في المدينه والمنطقه ككل.\n\nفي الاسلام\nالقدس هي ثالث اقدس الاماكن عند المسلمين بعد مكه والمدينه المنوره، وكانت تمثّل قبله الصلاه الاسلاميه طيله ما يُقارب من سنه، قبل ان تتحول القبله الى الكعبه في مكه. وقد اصبحت القدس مدينه ذات اهميّه دينيه عند المسلمين بعد ان اسرى الملاك جبريل بالنبي محمد اليها، وفق المعتقد الاسلامي، قرابه سنه 620 حيث عرج من الصخره المقدسه الى السماوات العلى حيث قابل جميع الانبياء والرسل الذين سبقوه وتلقّى من الله تعاليم الصلاه وكيفيه ادائها. تنص سوره الاسراء ان محمدًا اُسري به من المسجد الحرام الى «المسجد الاقصى»: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي اَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلاً مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ اِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الاَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ايَاتِنَا اِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ﴾؛ وقد اجمع المفسرون على ان المقصود بالمسجد الاقصى مدينه القدس ذاتها، وسُميت الاقصى لبعد المسافه بينها وبين المسجد الحرام، اذ لم يكن حين اذن فيها المسجد الاقصى الحالي. يقع اليوم معلمين اسلاميين في الموقع الذي عرج منه النبي محمد (صلى الله عليه وسلم) الى السماء، وهما قبه الصخره التي تحوي الصخره المقدسه، والمسجد الاقصى الذي بُني خلال العهد الاموي. ومما يجعل من القدس مدينه مهمه في الاسلام ايضًا، ان عددًا كبيرًا من الانبياء والصالحين الذين يتشارك المسلمون واهل الكتاب عمومًا بالايمان بهم، مع اختلاف النظره اليهم، حيث يعتبر المسلمون واليهود ان عدد منهم انبياء او رسل بينما ينظر المسيحيون اليهم بصفتهم قديسين، قطنوا المدينه عبر التاريخ او عبروها، ومنهم داود وسليمان وزكريا ويحيى والمسيح عيسى بن مريم، وكذلك لذكر المدينه في القران بانها وما حولها اراض مباركه شكّلت قبله للانبياء ومهبطًا للملائكه والوحي وان الناس يُحشرون فيها يوم القيامه.\nاما عند الشيعه الاثنا عشريه فالمسجد الاقصى مكانه في السماء الرابعه وليس على الارض فليس للمسجد الاقصى مكانه ذات اهميه لديهم، عن سلام الحناط، عن رجل، عن ابي عبد الله قال: سالته عن المساجد التي لها الفضل فقال: المسجد الحرام ومسجد الرسول، قلت: والمسجد الاقصى جعلت فداك؟ فقال: ذاك في السماء اليه اسري رسول الله صلى الله عليه واله فقلت: ان الناس يقولون: انه بيت المقدس؟ فقال: مسجد الكوفه افضل منه.\n\nفي المسيحيه\nيجلّ المسيحيون القدس لاسباب مختلفه، منها تاريخها الذي ورد ذكره في العهد القديم، اضافه الى لعبها دورًا محوريًا في حياه يسوع المسيح. ينص العهد الجديد ان يسوع اُحضر الى المدينه بعد ولادته بفتره قصيره، وتذكر التقاليد المسيحيه انه قام لاحقًا بتطهير معبد حيرود من الاصنام الرومانيه التي وضعها الملك حيرود داخله، وانه قلب موائد الصيارفه وكراسي باعه الحمام ولم يدع احدًا يجتاز الهيكل بمتاع.\nيؤمن البعض ان العليّه حيث تناول المسيح وتلاميذه العشاء الاخير، تقع على جبل صهيون في ذات المبنى حيث يقع ضريح الملك داود. ومن المواقع المسيحيه المقدسه في المدينه ايضًا، التلّه المعروفه باسم «جلجثه»، وهي موقع صلب يسوع بحسب الايمان المسيحي. يصف انجيل يوحنا هذه التلّه بانها تقع خارج القدس، الا ان بعض الحفريات اظهرت مؤخرًا انها تقع على بُعد مسافه قليله من البلده القديمه داخل حدود المدينه الحاليّه. امّا اقدس الاماكن المسيحيه في القدس فهي كنيسه القيامه، التي يحج اليها المسيحيون من مختلف انحاء العالم منذ حوالي الفيّ سنه، ويقول بعض الخبراء والمؤرخين انها اكثر المواقع احتمالاً بان تكون قد شُيدت على الجلجثه.\n\nفي اليهوديه\nاصبحت المدينه مقدسه عند اليهود بعد ان فتحها النبي والملك داود وجعلها عاصمه مملكه اسرائيل الموحده في القرن العاشر قبل الميلاد. وكانت القدس تحوي الهيكل الذي بناه سليمان بن داود، الذي يسميه اليهود «هيكل سليمان»، بالاضافه الى هيكل او معبد حيرود الذي شُيّد في وقت لاحق بعد ان هُدم الهيكل الاوّل. ورد ذكر هذا الهيكل 632 مرّه في الكتاب المقدس، وما زال اليهود اليوم يتعبدون عند حائط البراق او حائط المبكى، الذي يؤمنون بانه كل ما تبقى من المعبد القديم، ويُشكل هذا الحائط ثاني اقدس الاماكن في اليهوديه بعد «قدس الاقداس».\nتُبنى جميع الكنس في العالم ومحرابها يواجه القدس، اما محاريب كنس القدس فتواجه «قدس الاقداس». تنص التوراه الشفهيه والشريعه اليهوديه ان الصلاه يجب ان تتلى في اتجاه القدس وهيكل حيرود، والكثير من الاسر اليهوديه تضع لويحه «مزراح» على احدى جدران منزلها لتحديد قبله الصلاه. ذُكرت القدس في التناخ 669 مرّه، وذُكر اسم «صهيون» التي يقصد بها اليهود المدينه تاره وفلسطين ككل تاره اخرى، 154 مرّه.\n\nمعالم المدينه\nتعتبر البلده القديمه بحد ذاتها احدى المعالم التاريخيه المقدسيه. تبلغ مساحه القدس القديمه، ضمن الاسوار قرابه كيلومترًا مربعًا ويقع المسجد الاقصى في الناحيه الشرقيه من المدينه واسوارها. وتقسم المدينه الى حارات او خطط، وفي هذه الاحياء اسواق محليه صغيره استقلت عن الاسواق الرئيسه، وكانت الاحياء تضم مجموعات سكانيه منسجمه في بيئتها الاجتماعيه والدينيه، وطرق المدينه القديمه متعرجه، غُطي بعضها بعقود، وقد تقوم منشات او امتدادات عاليه للبيوت. ومن اهم هذه المنشات المساجد والماذن والمدارس، واذا استثنيت قبه الصخره والمسجد القبلي، فان اكثر المساجد والماذن في القدس تعود الى العصر المملوكي، مثل المئذنه الفخريه عام 1278، ومئذنه باب الغوانمه من عام 1329، ومئذنه باب الاسباط عام 1367. ومن المساجد هناك مسجد القلعه الذي بُني عام 1310، والمسجد القيمري عام 1276 وجامع الخانقاه الصلاحيه، وتعود مئذنته الى عام 1395. ومن المساجد التي بنيت في العهد العثماني مسجد النبي داود الذي انشاه السلطان سليمان القانوني وهو مجمع معماري، ولقد حوّلته اسرائيل الى كنيس وازيلت الكتابات القرانيه منه واستبدلت بكتابه عبريه، وجامع المولويه المُشيّد سنه 1587 والمسجد القيمري.\nان اكثر المباني الاسلاميه في القدس هي المدارس التعليميه. حيث ان عدد المدارس والزوايا في القدس خلال القرن الحادي عشر الهجري كان 630 مدرسه، ومن اقدم المدارس المدرسه المنصوريه التي انشاها الملك المنصور قلاوون. وتمتاز عماره المدارس بالفناء ذي البركه تشرف عليه الاواوين والغرف، اما الواجهه الجميله التي تدخل منها الى المدرسه من خلال دركاه، فهي من مميزات العماره المملوكيه، واذا كانت المدارس المملوكيه في القدس لم ترق الى مستوى المدارس في القاهره التي تميزت بالاتساع والفخامه كمدرسه السلطان حسن، فانها مع ذلك تتمتع بالاناقه والبساطه والوحده، ومن اهم المدارس المملوكيه الباقيه حتى اليوم: المدرسه السلاميه (1300م)، المدرسه الجاوليه (1320م)، المدرسه التنكزيه (1329م)، المدرسه الامينيه (1330م)، المدرسه الملكيه (1340م)، المدرسه الفارسيه (1353م)، المدرسه الارغونيه (1356م)، المدرسه القشتمريه (1358م)، المدرسه المحدثيه (1360م)، والمدرسه الطشتمريه (1384م). تشمل معالم القدس الحاليّه ما يلي:\n\nالثقافه\nتُعتبر القدس مدينهً تنصهر فيها دينيًا الثقافه في بوتقه واحده، نظرًا لاهميتها الدينيه ولعب الدين دورًا مهمًا في حياه سكانها من العرب والاسرائيليين، كما ان ثقافه سكان منطقه القدس شكلت جزءًا كبيرًا من هويتهم منذ زمن بعيد، والتي كانت في الاغلب ثقافه تعبر عن الحضر الفلسطيني، وهذا يظهر بشكل واضح في اللكنه او اللهجه التي تميز سكان هذه المنطقه عن معظم اللهجات الفلسطينيه بقلب القاف الى الف، كذلك هو الحال بالنسبه للزي التقليدي الذي تميّز في منطقه القدس ووسط الضفه الغربيه عن غيره من الازياء الفلسطينيه الاخرى، حيث ان لمدينه القدس ثوبها الخاص، الذي يمتاز بانه اكثر الاثواب الفلسطينيه جمعًا لاثار كل العصور التي مرت على المدينه، فعلى الصدر توجد قبه ملكات الكنعانيون وعلى الجوانب تظهر طريقه التصليب منذ ايام الحكم الصليبي، كما ويظهر الهلال والايات القرانيه كدليل على عوده القدس للحكم الاسلامي العربي. وبشكل عام فان اثار النكبه تظهر علي الثوب الفلسطيني، اذ يظهر الحزن والحنين من خلال الالوان، من خلال اختفاء الالوان الزاهيه مشيره الى ان ظهور تطريز الماكينه دليل على عدم اهتمام المراه بالتطريز وعلى الوضع الاقتصادي السيئ.\nيُعتبر المتحف الاسرائيلي احد اهم المواقع الثقافيه بالمدينه، حيث يستقبل نحو مليون زائر سنويًا، يُشكل السيّاح ثلثهم. تصل مساحه مجمّع المتحف الى 20 دونم (81,000 م2) وهو يضم عدد من المباني ذات المعارض المختلفه، حيث تُعرض اعمال فنيّه اسرائيليه واوروبيه، اضافه للعديد من المكتشفات الاثريه والمخطوطات اليهوديه القديمه. وفي المتحف معلمٌ بارز هو صحن مائي يُعرف بصحن الكتاب، وهو يحوي مخطوطات البحر الميت التي اكتُشفت في اواسط القرن العشرين في كهوف خربه قمران بالقرب من البحر سالف الذكر. خُصصت احدى اجنحه المتحف لتلقين الاطفال دروس في الرسم النحت، ويزور هذا الجناح قرابه 100,000 طفل في السنه، ولهذا المتحف حديقه خارجيه مخصصه لعرض اعمال النحت، ومن ابرز المنحوتات فيها المنحوته المصغره لمعبد حيرود. ومن المتاحف الاخرى ذات الاهميه، متحف روكفلر في القدس الشرقيه او «متحف فلسطين للاثار» سابقا، الذي بُني ايام الانتداب البريطاني في سنه 1938، وهو يُعد اوّل متحف للاثار شُيّد في الشرق الاوسط. والذي تتخذه اليوم سلطه الاثار الاسرائيليه مقرا لها.\n\nتاوي القدس النصب التذكاري المعروف باسم نصب «ياد ڤاشيم» (بالعبريه: יד ושם)، المخصص لاحياء ذكرى اليهود الذين قضوا في المحرقه النازيه، وهذا النصب مجمّع ذو اجنحه عديده تُشكل اكبر ارشيف عالميّ لكل ما يتعلق بالمحرقه سالفه الذكر. من ابرز اجنحه المجمّع متحفًا فريدًا يعرض مواضيعًا مختلفه تتعلق بالاباده الجماعيه لليهود ويُركز على الروايات والقصص المتعلقه ببعض الافراد والعائلات الذين قُتلوا انذاك، كما يعرض مجموعه فنيّه من اعمال بعض الفنانين الذين قضوا نحبهم في المحرقه. يُحيي هذا النصب ايضًا ذكرى الاطفال اليهود الذين قتلهم النازيون بالاضافه الى «الشرفاء من بين الامم»، ويُقصد بهم الاشخاص غير اليهود الذين خاطروا بحياتهم خلال الحرب العالميه الثانيه لانقاذ اطفال اليهود من الاعدام. كذلك هناك جناحٌ يُطلق عليه تسميه «الجناح الموصول»، وهو يعرض اعمال فنيّه تمثل العيش المشترك بين الاسرائيليين والفلسطينيين، وهو يقع على الطريق الفاصله بين القدس الشرقيه والغربيه.\n\nتتخذ عدّه مراق وفرق فنيّه من القدس مقرًا لها، ومن هذه الاوركسترا السمفونيه المقدسيّه التي تاسست في عقد الاربعينات من القرن العشرين، بالاضافه الى الاوركسترا الاسرائيليه التي تؤدي اعمالها الفنيه في مركز المؤتمرات الدوليه (بالعبريه: מרכז הקונגרסים הבינלאומי) الذي يقع بالقرب من مدخل القدس الغربيّه، وايضًا المركز الموسيقي في القدس، الواقع حي «يمين موشيه»، وغيرها. استضافت القدس «المهرجان الاسرائيلي» طيله 25 عامًا، وهذا المهرجان يُقام سنويًا منذ سنه 1961 وتؤدى فيه عدّه اعمال مسرحيه خارجيه وداخليه بالاضافه لحفلات موسيقيه لمغنين محليين وعالميين. يستضيف مسرح القدس في حاره الطالبيه ما يزيد عن 150 حفلاً موسيقيًا في السنه، الى جانب عروض مسرحيه وراقصه لفنانين عالميين. وهناك ايضًا «مسرح خان» الذي يقع في الكاروانسرا مقابل محطه القطارات القديمه، وهو مسرح الذخائر الوحيد بالمدينه. ومن البرامج الثقافيه الخاصه بالقدس، مهرجان القدس السينمائي، الذي تُعرض فيه اعمال سينمائيه اسرائيليه وعالميه.\n\nتؤوي القدس بعض معارض اللوحات مثل «بيت تيخو»، في وسط المدينه، وهو منزل قديم تحوّل الى متحف حاليًا، تُعرض فيه لوحات الفنانه «حنّه تيخو» المعروفه برسمها لتلال القدس، والمجموعات العبرانيه لزوجها الذي كان يعمل كحالاً، وافتتح اول عياده لطب العيون في القدس سنه 1912. كذلك هناك معرض الحوش، وهو معرض فني فلسطيني تاسس في سنه 2004 تُعرض فيه عدّه اعمال فنيّه لفنانين فلسطينيين.\n\nاعلنت القدس عاصمهً للثقافه العربيه في سنه 2009. تُشكل المدينه مقرًا للمسرح الوطني الفلسطيني، الذي يعمل على الحفاظ على الثقافه والهويّه العربيه والفلسطينيه للقدس، بالاضافه لاجراء عدّه نشاطات تهدف الى احياء اهتمام الفلسطينيين بالفن. يرعى معهد ادوارد سعيد الوطني للموسيقى الاوركسترا الشبابيه الفلسطينيه، التي قامت بجوله فنيّه شملت دول الخليج العربي وغيرها من دول الشرق الاوسط في سنه 2009. يقع المتحف الاسلامي في القدس على متن الحرم القدسي الشريف، وقد تاسس هذا المتحف في سنه 1923، وهو يضم كثيرًا من القطع الاثريه الاسلاميه، التي تتراوح من ادوات الكحل صغيره الحجم والمخطوطات النادره، الى العواميد الرخاميه الضخمه. حظرت اسرائيل احتفالات اعلان القدس عاصمهً للثقافه العربيه بحجه انها كانت برعايه السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه، واقيم احتفال في بلده بيت عنان عوضًا عن ذلك، وعلى مدى 4 ايام، وحضره ما يزيد عن 15,000 شخص.\nهناك عدد من المؤسسات والمنظمات اللاربحيّه في القدس، التي تسعى للتقريب بين السكان من العرب والاسرائيليين، ومن شاكله هذه المنظمات: «الصندوق الابراهيمي» و«مركز التبادل الثقافي المقدسي»، الذان يُشجعان على القيام بمشاريع ثقافيه مشتركه بين الاسرائيليين والفلسطينيين، كذلك «مركز القدس للموسيقى والرقص الشرقي» الذي يُخصص حلقات عمل للاسرائيليين والعرب على حد سواء، ويهدف الى تعزيز لغه الحوار والتواصل بين الطرفين عن طريق تشجيعهم على القيام باعمال فنيّه مشتركه، ايضًا هناك الاوركسترا اليهوديه العربيه الشبابيّه، التي تؤدي عروض موسيقيه تقليديه اوروبيه وشرق اوسطيّه. قام الفنان البولندي «تشيسلاو دزاڤيگاي» بصنع منحوته تمثّل التعايش السلمي الذي يُطمح اليه بين الفلسطينيين والاسرائيليين، واطلق عليه «نصب التسامح» ونُصب في سنه 2008 على تله فاصله بين مستوطنه تلبيوت الشرقيه وجبل المكبر، كعلامه على نضال المقدسيين في سبيل الحصول على السلام.\n\nالاقتصاد\nكان الحج الى القدس يُشكل ابرز مواردها الماليه عبر التاريخ، بما انها مدينه داخليه تقع بعيدًا عن المرافئ الهامّه مثل يافا وغزه. لا تزال المعالم الدينيه في القدس هي ما يستقطب الزوّار الاجانب بشكل رئيسي، حيث ان معظمهم ياتي ليزور حائط البراق وكنيسه القيامه والمسجد الاقصى، وغيرها من الاماكن في البلده القديمه، الا انه اصبح من الجليّ خلال نصف القرن الفائت ان المدينه لا يمكنها ان تعتمد على هذه الزيارات وحدها لتؤمن مدخولاً كافيًا يفي بجميع الحاجات الحياتيه للسكان.\nتُظهر عدّه احصائيات ان اقتصاد المدينه في نمو مطّرد، الا انه من الملاحظ بان القدس الشرقيه لا تزال اقل نموًا من الغربيه، لكن على الرغم من ذلك فان نسبه الاسر العربيه التي يعمل عدد من افرادها اعلى من تلك الخاصه بالاسر اليهوديه، حيث تصل الاولى الى 76.1% والثانيه الى 66.8%. يصل معدّل البطاله في القدس الى 8.3%، وهو بهذا اقل من المعدّل الوطني الاسرائيلي الذي يصل الى 9.0%، على الرغم من ان نسبه القوّه العامله بالمدينه اقل من تلك الخاصه بمدن اخرى مثل تل ابيب (58.0%) وحيفا (52.4%). اظهرت دراسات اخرى ان نسبه الفقر بالقدس ارتفعت بشكل ملحوظ خلال الفتره الممتده من سنه 2001 حتى سنه 2007، حيث ازدادت نسبه السكان الذين يعيشون تحت خط الفقر بحوالي 40%. وصل معدّل المدخول الشهري للعامل في القدس خلال سنه 2006 الى 5,940 شيكل جديد (1,410 دولار امريكي)، اي اقل بحوالي 1,350 شيكل من العامل في تل ابيب.\n\nاصدرت السلطات البريطانيه قانونًا ايام الانتداب ينص على عدم جواز تشييد المباني الا باستخدام الحجر المقدسي، وذلك في سبيل الحفاظ على الهويّه التاريخيه وجماليّه هذه المدينه الفريده، وما زال هذا القانون ساري المفعول حتى الوقت الحالي، وهناك جهود لتكملته عن طريق عدم التشجيع على بناء المصانع داخل القدس؛ وقد خصصت السلطات الاسرائيليه 2.2% فقط من مساحه المدينه لتشييد المصانع، وبالمقابل يُلاحظ ان نسبه الاراضي المخصصه للبنى التحتيه في تل ابيب تفوق تلك الخاصه بالقدس بحوالي الضعف، بينما تفوق نسبه تلك الاراضي في حيفا نسبه اراضي القدس بحوالي سبعه مرّات. يعمل ما نسبته 8.5% من اجمالي القوه العامله الخاصه بمحافظه القدس في قطاع الصناعه، وهذا يُشكل نصف المعدل الوطني في اسرائيل (15.8%)، بالمقابل تفوق نسبه المقدسيين العاملين في قطاعات اخرى باقي المعدلات الوطنيه. قامت بضعه شركات التقنيه العاليه بفتح فروع لها او نقل مراكزها حتى من تل ابيب الى القدس، وقد ادّى مثل هذا الامر الى توفير 12,000 فرصه عمل جديده في سنه 2006. من المراكز الاقتصاديه المهمه في القدس ما يُعرف باسم «مجمّع الصناعات العلميه الغنيّه»، وهو مجمّع يقع في شمال المدينه ويُشكل مقرًا لبعض اهم الشركات مثل: انتل، شركه تيڤا لصناعه الادويه، اتوترونكس عوفير، وشركه ECI للاتصالات. يُخطط بعض المسؤولين لتوسعه هذا المجمّع حتى يُغطي مساحه 530,000 متر مربّع (130 فدّان)، ويتسع لمزيد من الشركات بالاضافه لمحطه اطفاء ومدرسه.\nلعبت الحكومه الاسرائيليه دورًا كبيرًا في تنميه اقتصاد القدس منذ تاسيس «دوله» اسرائيل، فهناك عدد كبير من الوظائف الحكوميه الشاغره بالمدينه، كونها مقر للحكومه، والاخيره تقدم دعمًا وحوافز متعدده للشركات والمؤسسات الوليده، كي تستمر متمركزه بالقدس. افادت مجله «السياحه والترفيه» (بالانجليزيه: Travel + Leisure) الامريكيه ان القدس هي افضل مدن افريقيا والشرق الاوسط للسياحه الترفيهيه في سنه 2010.\nيقول الخبراء ان اقتصاد القدس الشرقيه لا يزال يُعاني من مشاكل وعوائق مختلفه لاسباب عديده، منها جدار الفصل العازل الذي شيدته اسرائيل في عمق الضفه الغربيه وفي محيط مدينه القدس، الامر الذي يؤدي الى اخراج مدينه القدس من ارتباطها ببقيه الاراضي الفلسطينيه في الضفه الغربيه، والذي يجعلها مفتوحه فقط نحو اسرائيل، بالاضافه لاقامه الحواجز العسكريه واعاقه دخول سكان القرى المجاوره للقدس، وباقي سكان المدن الفلسطينيه مع ارتفاع تكلفه نقل البضائع نتيجه الحواجز والاغلاق. وحسب تقديرات الغرفه التجاريه في اخر دراسه اعدتها في شهر يوليو من سنه 2006 فانّ مدينه القدس كانت بحاجه الى استثمارات فوريه تقارب المئه وخمسون مليون دولار كنقطه بدايه كاستثمارات فوريه خلال الاعوام الثلاثه القادمه، وتشمل هذه الاستثمارات مجالات الاسكان السياحه وترميم البلده القديمه، وتطوير الصناعات الحرفيه في المدينه.\n\nومن الصعوبات التي تواجه هذا الشطر من المدينه وتعيق نموّه بشكل مطّرد التشدد في فرض الضرائب وجبايتها وتطبيق باقي القوانين الاقتصاديه والاجتماعيه على العرب الفلسطينيين في القدس. كذلك يقول الخبراء الفلسطينيون ان هنالك تشدّد في منع دخول المنتجات الفلسطينيه الى اسواق القدس، خصوصاً المنتجات الغذائيه كالالبان البيض وهي منتجات اقلّ سعراً من المنتجات الاسرائيليه المماثله.\nوقد ادّت القيود والاجراءات الاسرائيليه الى تراجع الاداء الاقتصادي للقدس الشرقيه في مختلف القطاعات، فقد اضطر عدد من المصانع الى تقليص انتاجها او اغلاق مصانعها بسبب انخفاض الطلب على المنتجات المحليه غير الغذائيه منها الى الثلث وضعف امكانيه المنتج المحلي على المنافسه نتيجه لارتفاع تكاليف التوزيع بسبب الاغلاق، كذلك ظهر انه في شهر اكتوبر من سنه 2000 انقطع التدفّق السياحي الى الشطر الشرقي، والغيت جميع الحجوزات حتى نهايه سنه 2001، فكان من نتيجه ذلك ان اغلقت بضعه فنادق ابوابها وسرّحت موظفيها.\n\nيقول مدير الغرفه التجاريه في القدس الشرقيه، عزّام ابو السعود، انّ موضوع الاستثمار، وبوجه الخصوص الاستثمار طويل المدى، او الذي يستغرق اقامه منشاته عده سنوات، والبحث عن مستثمرين، هو العنصر الذي يجب التركيز عليه في سبيل النهوض باقتصاد القدس الشرقيه، ودعا الى انشاء صندوق ضمان الاستثمار، الذي يضمن للمستثمر الخائف عائدًا مناسبًا لامواله، وضمانات ان لا يؤثّر الوضع الامني السياسي على مشروعه، وضمان عائد مجدي لاستثماره، كذلك دعا الى عدم اغفال موضوع التدريب واقتباس النموذج الالماني في التدريب الحرفي، كونه النموذج الذي قاد الالمان لاعاده بناء اقتصادهم الذي دمرته الحرب العالميه الثانيه. وقال انه يجب ان يتم احياء مشروع سوق القطّانين بالبلده القديمه، وكذلك الحمامات المملوكيه او التركيه بعد ترميمها. هذا بالاضافه الى تحويل جزء من الاستثمار الى قطاع الاسكان والانشاءات لتوفير المنازل الكافيه لبقاء اكبر عدد من سكان القدس. والاهتمام الاكبر بترميم منازل البلده القديمه، وانْ يشمل المنازل القديمه خارج السور وذلك لتوفير نوعيه حياه افضل للسكان. وفي سنه 2010، اعلن المهندس مازن سنقرط رئيس مجموعه سنقرط الاستثماريه عن تاسيس شركه قابضه في القدس تحمل اسم«القدس القابضه» براسمال 20 مليون دولار بهدف الاستثمار في عدد من القطاعات الاقتصاديه والتعليميه في القدس الشرقيه.\n\nالمواصلات\nيُعتبر مطار القدس الدولي اقرب المطارات الى القدس، وقد كان يُستخدم للطيران المدني حتى اغلقته السلطات الاسرائيليه في سنه 2001، وسيطر عليه الجيش الاسرائيلي لقمع الانتفاضه التي قامت في وجه اسرائيل في الضفه الغربيه وقطاع غزه. تحوّلت جميع الرحلات الجويّه بعد اغلاق المطار الى مطار بن غوريون الدولي، وهو اكبر مطارات اسرائيل واكثرها ازدحامًا، حيث يصل عدد المسافرين فيه سنويًا الى 9 ملايين مسافر.\nتتولى شركه «ايگد» التعاونيه، وهي ثاني اكبر شركه نقل بالحفلات في العالم، تقديم خدمه النقل للسكّان من والى القدس، وبداخلها، وهي تتمركز في محطه حافلات المدينه الواقعه في شارع يافا بالقرب من مدخل الطريق السريع الغربي للقدس. كانت الحافلات وسيارات الاجره والسيارات الخصوصيه هي وسائل النقل الاكثر استعمالاً في القدس حتى سنه 2008، عندما اُطلق مشروع سكه الحديد الخفيفه، وابتُدئ العمل فيه على قدم وساق. يقول المهندسون العاملون على المشروع، ان هذه القاطرات ستقدم خدمه النقل لحوالي 200,000 شخص يوميًا، وسيكون لها 24 محطه. انتهى العمل على هذه السكّه في 15 يونيو سنه 2010، وتمت تجربه القاطره الاولى في 23 اغسطس من نفس العام.\n\nمن المشاريع الاخرى التي تنوي اسرائيل تنفيذها بالقدس، مشروع سكه حديديه سريعه تمتد من تل ابيب الى القدس، يُخطط الانتهاء من العمل عليها في سنه 2011، وستكون محطتها الاخيره محطهً تحتارضيّه على عمق 80 مترًا (262.47 قدمًا)، تقع بالقرب من مركز المؤتمرات الدوليه ومحطه الحافلات، ويهدف المسؤولون الى وصل هذه السكه في نهايه المطاف بمحطه المالحه، وهي محطه القطارات المملوكه من قبل الدوله، والتي تقدم خدمه النقل من القدس الى تل ابيب مرورًا بمدينه بيت شيمش.\nتُعتبر طريق مناحيم بيگن السريعه احدى ابرز طرق القدس التي تصل شمالها بجنوبها؛ فهي تمتد على طول القسم الغربي من القدس وتتصل بطريق «معاليه بيت حورون» في الشمال لتكمل اتجاهها نحو تل ابيب. يمتد الطريق السريع رقم 60 عبر وسط المدينه بالقرب من الخط الاخضر الفاصل بين القدس الشرقيه والغربيه. يجري العمل حاليًا على تشييد طريق تحيط بالمدينه يبلغ طولها 35 كيلومترًا (22 ميلاً) لتصل الضواحي ببعضها البعض، لكن ردود الفعل حول هذا المشروع جاءت متناقضه حيث عارضه البعض وقبله البعض الاخر.\n\nالتعليم\nتتخذ عدّه جامعات مرموقه من القدس مقرًا لها، وتؤمّن برامج تعليميه للطلاّب باللغات العربيه، العبريه، والانگليزيه، ومن هذه الجامعات الجامعه العبريه التي تاسست في سنه 1925، وتُعتبر حاليًا من بين افضل 100 مؤسسه تعليميه في العالم. كان بعض ابرز العقول المفكره في العالم اعضاءً في مجلس امناء هذه الجامعه، ومنهم البرت اينشتاين وسيگموند فرويد، وقد تخرّج منها بعض الفائزين بجوائز نوبل مثل: اڤرام هيرشكو، داود گروس، ودانيال كاهنمان. تشتهر الجامعه العبريه بمكتبتها المعروفه بالمكتبه اليهوديه، التي يُحتفظ فيها باكثر من 5 ملايين كتاب. افتتحت هذه المكتبه في سنه 1892، اي قبل افتتاح الجامعه ذاتها بحوالي ثلاثه عقود، وهي اليوم المكتبه المركزيه للجامعه ومكتبه اسرائيل الوطنيه. للجامعه العبريه 3 احرام جامعيّه في القدس: على جبل المشارف، تله الشيخ بدر، وحرم طبيّ في مستشفى حداثه بعين كارم.\nتاسست جامعه القدس المفتوحه في سنه 1984 لتكون جامعه رائده لسكّان القدس العرب، وتصف الجامعه نفسها على انها «الجامعه العربيه الوحيده في القدس». تعاونت جامعه القدس المفتوحه وكليّه بارد من نيويورك على افتتاح كليّه مشتركه في ذات المبنى الذي كان يُشكل مقر المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني حيث كان يقع مكتب الرئيس الفلسطيني ياسر عرفات، وذلك في خريف سنه 2010، ومن المقرر انشاء برنامج دراسي لمنح درجه ماجستير تدريس الاداب. يقع الحرم الرئيسي لهذه الجامعه جنوب شرقي القدس في بلده ابو ديس، وتبلغ مساحته 190,000 متر مربّع (47 فدّان). ومن مؤسسات التعليم العالي الاخرى في المدينه: اكاديميه القدس لتعليم الموسيقى والرقص، واكاديميه بيتسالئيل للفنون والتصميم، وكلا المبنيين يقعان في حرم الجامعه العبريه.\n\nتاسست كليّه القدس للعلوم التقنيه في سنه 1969، وهي تؤمن برامج تدريب هندسيه وتقنيه للطلاّب، وهذه الكليّه هي احدى المدارس التي تجمع بين البرامج العلمانيه والدينيّه في القدس الغربيه، وفي الشطر الاخير من المدينه عدد من المدارس الدينيه اليهوديه مثل «مدرسه صموئيل» و«مدرسه مير يشيڤا»، التي يُزعم انها اكبرها. وصل عدد التلاميذ في السنه الدراسيه الاخيره في المدارس اليهوديه خلال العام الدراسي 2003–2004 الى 8,000 تلميذ، الا ان 55% من هؤلاء فقط يتقدمون لامتحان شهاده الثانويه العامه، اما الباقون فيلتحقون بالمعاهد المهنيه الحريديه. تُقدّم بلديّه القدس حوافزًا ماليه في سبيل استقطاب المزيد من التلاميذ اليهود الى الجامعات الاسرائيليه في القدس، بالاضافه الى اعانات لاولئك الذين يستاجرون شققًا سكنيه للاقامه فيها طيله مده دراستهم.\n\nتسعى المؤسسات الاسرائيليه المختلفه وبدعم من الحكومه من اجل تحقيق سيطره مطلقه على قطاع التعليم العربي في مدينه القدس، وذلك بعد ان تمّ التحكم بنحو 66% من قطاع التعليم العربي في مدينه القدس، حيث تم فرض المناهج التعليميه على المدارس الابتدائيه العربيه هناك منذ عام 1968، وتبعًا لذلك تم استبدال كلمه «فلسطين» بكلمه «اسرائيل» و«القدس» بكلمه «اورشليم القدس». ويقول الخبراء الفلسطينيون ان الحكومه الاسرائيليه تحاول التضييق على الطلبه العرب في مدينه القدس لاجبارهم على ترك المدينه للاستئثار بخيارات التعليم، الامر الذي يعرضهم للانتقال من مدينه القدس وفقًا لما تنص عليه القوانين الاسرائيليه. يُعاني معظم الطلاّب العرب في القدس من عوائق ومشاكل عديده من جراء السياسات الاسرائيليه، فثمه اكتظاظ شديد في الصفوف المدرسيه والدوام في غالبيه المدارس على فترتين، وهناك نقص حاد وكبير في المختبرات في المدارس العربيه في القدس، ناهيك عن ضعف التجهيزات الرياضيه وكذلك النقص الواضح للمعلمين والخدمات، والملاحظ ايضًا ان المدارس غير مؤهله للتدريس الجيد بسبب قدمها وعدم القيام بعمليه تحديث ضروريه. ونظرًا لهذه الاسباب وصلت نسبه تسرب الطلبه العرب في القدس قبل الوصول الى المرحله الثانويه الى نحو 50% خلال العقد الاول من القرن الحادي والعشرين، كما تشير احدى الدراسات، وقد ادّى هذا الى هجره لطلاّب واسر كامله الى مدن وقرى الضفه الغربيه للبحث عن فرص تعليم مجانيه. يلتحق البعض من المقدسيين العرب بالمدارس الاسرائيليه، لكن هؤلاء يتبعون في غالبيتهم ادارات وسياسات اما البلديه او وزاره المعارف الاسرائيليه، التي تهدف الى «تعميق المفاهيم الصهيونيه، وضرب الانتماء الفلسطيني، من خلال حصص تعليميه عن الهويه اليهوديه والتراث اليهودي الصهيوني، وربط الهبات والمكافات للمدارس بنسبه التجنيد للجيش او الخدمه المدنيه والعسكريه، الى جانب معايير اخرى».\nاطلقت ملكه الاردن رانيا العبد الله مبادره «مدرستي فلسطين» وذلك لدعم التعليم وتحسين البيئه التعليميه في مدارس القدس العربيه، «لا لان للاردن علاقه بالقدس ودورًا تاريخيًا فقط ولكن لان القدس مسؤوليه كل عربي اولاً واخيرًا» على حد تعبيرها. من ابرز المؤسسات التعليميه في القدس الشرقيه، المركز المعروف باسم «المركز التربوي لتطوير العاملين في حقل التعليم في القدس»، الذي يُعتبر المركز الوحيد التي يقدم الخدمات لمعلمي شرقي القدس. يرى المركز نفسه كمحور تربوي يُقدم الخدمات لجهاز التعليم بكل ما لديه من موارد وامكانات.\n\nالرياضه\nتعتبر كل من كره القدم وكره السله، اللعبتان الاكثر شعبيه في مدينه القدس، سواء عند العرب او اليهود. يعتبر نادي جبل المكبر (المؤسس في 1976) من اشهر الانديه المقدسيه والذي يلعب بالدوري الفلسطيني الممتاز بالضفه الغربيه، والذي هو عضو في الاتحاد الاسيوي لكره القدم، ويتخذ من ملعب فيصل الحسيني مركزًا له، والذي يقع في الرام شمال القدس. من جهه اخرى، يعتبر كل من نادي بيتار القدس ونادي هابويل القدس من اكثر الانديه شهره في اسرائيل، ويتخذان ايضًا من ملاعب القدس مركزًا لهما. من الانديه الفلسطينيه الاخرى في القدس: هلال القدس، العربي بيت صفافا، الانصار المقدسي، دي لاسال، اهلي القدس، جبل الزيتون، اسلامي سلوان، ابناء القدس، ارثوذكسي القدس، وغيرها.\nعرفت الرياضه النسويه الفلسطينيه نهوضًا ملحوظًا في القدس منذ ان تولى اللواء جبريل الرجوب رئاسه اتحاد الكره الفلسطينيه واللجنه الاولمبيه الفلسطينيه، وقد تاسس فريق كره القدم النسائيه الاول بالمدينه حوالي سنه 2008، وواجه وما زال مشكلات كبيره وهي النقص الحاد في الدعم المادي وحتى المعنوي، لكنه استطاع ان يصبح من الانديه المعروفه على الرغم من ذلك.\nيقام في القدس سنويًا، سباق جري سنوي نصفي، حيث يركض المتسابقون من كل انحاء العالم متنافسين في جوله حول اشهر معالم المدينه. بالاضافه الى هذا السباق النصفي ذو 21.1 كم، يمكن للمشاركين الركض مسافه 10 كم. كل من المسارين يبدا وينتهي عند تله الشيخ بدر او «گفعات رام».\n\nالاعلام\nخرج من القدس عددٌ من المشاهير، من عرب واسرائيليين، ومنهم:\n\nالعرب\nمحمد كامل البديري، مفوض مقاطعه رام الله خلال العهد العثماني ومؤسس جريده الصباح.\nمبارك عوّاد، عالم نفس فلسطيني

          "summary": "القُدْس هي أكبر مدن فِلسْطِين المحتلّة مساحةً وسكانًا وأكثرها أهمية دينيًا واقتصاديًا. تُعرف بأسماء أخرى في اللغة العربية مثل: بيت المقدس، القدس الشريف، أولى القبلتين، وفي الكتاب المقدس باسم أورشليم، وتسميها إسرائيل رسمياً: أورشليم القدس.\nيعتبرها العرب والفلسطينيون وقطاع عريض من داعمي القضية الفلسطينية، عاصمةَ دولة فلسطين المستقبلية بعد التحرير، كما ورد في وثيقة إعلان الاستقلال الفلسطينية التي صدرت في الجزائر بتاريخ 15 نوفمبر سنة 1988م، (أما تاريخياً كون أجدادهم اليبوسيين تاريخياً، أول من بنى المدينة وسكنها في الألف الخامس ق.م). فيما تعتبرها إسرائيل عاصمتها الموحدة، أثر ضمها الجزء الشرقي من المدينة عام 1980م، والذي احتلته بعد حرب سنة 1967 (يعتبرها اليهود عاصمتهم الدينية والوطنية لأكثر من 3000 سنة). أما الأمم المتحدة والمجتمع الدولي، فلا يعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، ويعتبر القدس الشرقية جزءاً من الأراضي الفلسطينية، ولا يعترف بضمها للدولة العبرية، مع بعض الاستثناءات. تقع القدس ضمن سلسلة جبال الخليل وتتوسط المنطقة الواقعة بين البحر المتوسط والطرف الشمالي للبحر الميت، وقد نمت هذه المدينة وتوسعت حدودها كثيرًا عما كانت عليه في العصور السابقة.\nتُعتبر القدس مدينة مقدسة عند أتباع الديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث الرئيسية: اليهودية، المسيحية، الإسلام. فبالنسبة لليهود، أصبحت المدينة أقدس المواقع بعد أن فتحها النبي والملك داود وجعل منها عاصمة مملكة إسرائيل الموحدة حوالي سنة 1000 ق.م، ثم أقدم ابنه سليمان، على بناء أول هيكل فيها، كما تنص التوراة. وعند المسيحيين، أصبحت المدينة موقعًا مقدسًا، بعد أن صُلب يسوع المسيح على إحدى تلالها المسماة «جلجثة» حوالي سنة 30 للميلاد، وبعد أن عثرت القديسة هيلانة على الصليب الذي عُلّق عليه بداخل المدينة بعد حوالي 300 سنة، وفقًا لما جاء في العهد الجديد. أما عند المسلمين، فالقدس هي ثالث أقدس المدن بعد مكة والمدينة المنورة، وهي أولى القبلتين، حيث كان المسلمون يتوجهون إليها في صلاتهم بعد أن فُرضت عليهم حوالي سنة 610 للميلاد، وهي أيضًا تمثل الموقع الذي عرج منه نبي الإسلام محمد بن عبد الله إلى السماء وفقًا للمعتقد الإسلامي. وكنتيجة لهذه الأهمية الدينية العظمى، تحوي المدينة القديمة عددًا من المعالم الدينية ذات الأهمية الكبرى، مثل: كنيسة القيامة، حائط البراق والمسجد الأقصى - المكون من عدة معالم مقدسة أهمها مسجد قبة الصخرة والمسجد القبلي، على الرغم من أن مساحتها تصل إلى 0.9 كيلومترات مربعة (0.35 أميال مربعة).\nخلال تاريخها الطويل، تعرضت القدس للتدمير مرتين، وحوصرت 23 مرة، وهوجمت 52 مرة، وتمّ غزوها وفقدانها مجددًا 44 مرة. استوطن البشر الموقع الذي شُيدت به المدينة منذ الألفية الرابعة ق.م، الأمر الذي يجعل من القدس إحدى أقدم المدن المأهولة في العالم. تُصنّف المدينة القديمة على أنها موقع تراث عالمي، وقد جرت العادة والعرف على تقسيمها إلى 4 حارات، إلا أن الأسماء المستخدمة اليوم لكل حارة من هذه الحارات: حارة الأرمن، حارة النصارى، حارة الشرف (أو حارة اليهود)، وحارة المسلمين، لم تظهر إلا في أوائل القرن التاسع عشر. رشحت الأردن المدينة القديمة لتُدرج ضمن قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي المهددة في سنة 1982.\nيُعتبر النزاع القائم حول وضع القدس مسألةً محورية في الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي. أقدمت الحكومة الإسرائيلية بعد حرب سنة 1967 بين الجيوش العربية والإسرائيلية على احتلال القدس الشرقية التي كانت تتبع الأردن، وألحقتها بإسرائيل واعتبرتها جزءاً لا يتجزأ منها، إلا أن المجتمع الدولي بأغلبيته، لم يعترف بهذا الضم، وما زال ينظر إلى القدس الشرقية على أنها منطقة متنازع عليها ويدعو بين الحين والآخر إلى حل هذه القضية عن طريق إجراء مفاوضات سلميّة بين إسرائيل والفلسطينيين. كذلك، فإن أغلبية الدول في العالم لا تعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، لذا فإن معظم السفارات والقنصليات الأجنبية تقع في مدينة تل أبيب وضواحيها. طالب الفلسطينيون -وما زالوا- بالقدس الشرقية عاصمةً لدولة فلسطينية، منذ أن احتلها الإسرائيليون، إلا أن البرلمان الإسرائيلي أقرّ في 31 يوليو سنة 1980 «قانون أساس: القدس عاصمة إسرائيل»، الذي جعل إعلان القدس، بالحدود التي رسمتها الحكومة الإسرائيلية عام 1967، مبدأً دستوريًا في القانون الإسرائيلي. رد مجلس الأمن بقرارين، رقم 476 ورقم 478 سنة 1980 وجه اللوم إلى إسرائيل بسبب إقرار هذا القانون وأكد أنه يخالف القانون الدولي، وليس من شأنه أن يمنع استمرار سريان اتفاقية جنيف الرابعة لسنة 1949 على الجزء الشرقي من القدس، كما ويفترض أن تكون المدينة ضمن محافظة القدس التابعة لدولة فلسطين. أدارت منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية مركزًا لها في بيت الشرق بالقدس إلا أنه أغلق في سنة 2001 بأمر من وزارة الداخلية الإسرائيلية.\nتقع معظم الإدارات الحكومية الإسرائيلية في القدس الغربية، وهي تشمل: البرلمان الإسرائيلي أو الكنيست، مقريّ رئيس الوزراء ورئيس الدولة، والمحكمة العليا. القدس أيضًا هي مقر الجامعة العبرية ومتحف إسرائيل ومزار الكتاب، وفيها أيضًا حديقة الحيوان الكتابية، التي تُصنّف على أنها جاذب هام في السياحة الداخلية، واستاد تيدي الذي يُعتبر أحد أهم وأكبر ملاعب كرة القدم في إسرائيل.",

          "content": "Hebron (Arabic: الخليل, romanized: al-Khalīl, ) is a city in the southern West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Hebron Governorate, which is the largest in the West Bank. It is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south of Jerusalem. The population inside in the city limits is 201,063, while the adjacent metropolitan area within the governorate is home to over 700,000 people. Hebron spans across an area of 74.1 square kilometers (28.6 sq mi). It is the third largest city in the country after Gaza and East Jerusalem. The city is often considered one of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism, as well as in Christianity and Islam.\nIt is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the Levant. According to the Bible, Abraham settled in Hebron and bought the Cave of the Patriarchs as burial place for his wife Sarah. Biblical tradition holds that the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah, were buried in the cave. The city is also recognized in the Bible as the place where David was anointed king of Israel. Following the Babylonian captivity, the Edomites settled in Hebron. During the first century BCE, Herod the Great built the wall that still surrounds the Cave of the Patriarchs, which later became a church, and then a mosque. With the exception of a brief Crusader control, successive Muslim dynasties ruled Hebron from the 7th century CE until the Ottoman Empire's dissolution following World War I, when the city became part of British Mandatory Palestine.\nThe 1929 Hebron massacre of nearly 70 Jews and the Arab uprising of 1936–39 led the British government to evacuate the Jewish community from Hebron. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Hebron, occupied and annexed by Jordan, and since the 1967 Six-Day War, the city has been under Israeli control. Following Israeli occupation, Jewish presence was restored in the city. Since the 1997 Hebron Protocol, most of Hebron has been governed by the Palestinian National Authority. The city is often described as a \"microcosm\" of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. The 1997 protocol divided the city into two sectors—H1 Hebron, governed by the Palestinian National Authority, and H2 Hebron, occupied by Israeli authorities. All security arrangements and travel permits for local residents are coordinated between the Palestinian Authority and Israel via the COGAT. The Jewish settlers have their own governing municipal body, the Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron.\nThe largest city in the southern West Bank, Hebron is a chief commercial and industrial center in the region. It is a busy hub of trade, generating roughly a third of the area's GDP, largely due to the sale of limestone from quarries in its area. Hebron has a local reputation for its grapes, figs, ceramics, plastics, pottery workshops, metalworking and glassblowing industry. The city is home to numerous shopping malls. The Old City of Hebron features narrow, winding streets, flat-roofed stone houses, and old bazaars. It is recognized as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. Hebron is also known as a regional educational and medical hub.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Hebron appears to trace back to two northwest Semitic languages, which coalesce in the form ḥbr, having reflexes in Hebrew and Amorite, with a basic sense of 'unite' and connoting a range of meanings from 'colleague' to 'friend'. In the proper name Hebron, the original sense may have been 'alliance'.\nEarly Muslim sources refer to the city as Ḥabra (حبرة) or Ḥabrūn (حبرون). al-Khalīl emerged as the Arabic name for the city in the 13th century, derived from the Qur'anic epithet for Abraham, Khalīl al-Raḥmān ('Friend of the Merciful [ie. God]'). Thus, the epithet is a calque of the original Hebrew toponym Ḥeḇrōn, understood as ḥaḇēr ('friend').\n\nHistory\nBronze and Iron Age\nArchaeological excavations reveal traces of strong fortifications dated to the Early Bronze Age, covering some 24–30 dunams centered around Tel Rumeida. The city flourished in the 17th–18th centuries BCE before being destroyed by fire, and was resettled in the late Middle Bronze Age. This older Hebron was originally a Canaanite royal city. Abrahamic legend associates the city with the Hittites. It has been conjectured that Hebron might have been the capital of Shuwardata of Gath, an Indo-European contemporary of Jerusalem's regent, Abdi-Ḫeba, although the Hebron hills were almost devoid of settlements in the Late Bronze Age.\n\nAncient Israel\nThe Abrahamic traditions associated with Hebron are nomadic. This may also reflect a Kenite element, since the nomadic Kenites are said to have long occupied the city, and Heber is the name for a Kenite clan. In the narrative of the later Hebrew conquest, Hebron was one of two centers under Canaanite control. They were ruled by the three sons of Anak (benê/yelîdê hāʿănaq). or may reflect some Kenite and Kenizzite migration from the Negev to Hebron, since terms related to the Kenizzites appear to be close to Hurrian. This suggests that behind the Anakim legend lies some early Hurrian population. In Biblical lore they are represented as descendants of the Nephilim. The Book of Genesis mentions that it was formerly called Kiryath-arba, or \"city of four\", possibly referring to the four pairs or couples who were buried there, or four tribes, or four quarters, four hills, or a confederated settlement of four families.\nThe story of Abraham's purchase of the Cave of the Patriarchs from the Hittites constitutes a seminal element in what was to become the Jewish attachment to the land in that it signified the first \"real estate\" of Israel long before the conquest under Joshua. In settling here, Abraham is described as making his first covenant, an alliance with two local Amorite clans who became his ba'alei brit or masters of the covenant.\nThe Hebron of the Israelites was centered on what is now known as Tel Rumeida, while its ritual center was located at Elonei Mamre. Hebrew Bible narrative also describes the city.\n\nIt is said to have been wrested from the Canaanites by either Joshua, who is said to have wiped out all of its previous inhabitants, \"destroying everything that drew breath, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded\", or the Tribe of Judah as a whole, or specifically Caleb the Judahite. The town itself, with some contiguous pasture land, is then said to have been granted to the Levites of the clan of Kohath, while the fields of the city, as well as its surrounding villages were assigned to Caleb (Joshua 21:3–12; 1 Chronicles 6:54–56), who expels the three giants, Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, who ruled the city. Later, the biblical narrative has King David called by God to relocate to Hebron and reign from there for some seven years (2 Samuel 2:1–3). It is there that the elders of Israel come to him to make a covenant before Elohim and anoint him king of Israel. It was in Hebron again that Absalom has himself declared king and then raises a revolt against his father David (2 Samuel 15:7–10). It became one of the principal centers of the Tribe of Judah and was classified as one of the six traditional Cities of Refuge.\nAs is shown by the discovery at Lachish, the second most important city in the Kingdom of Judah after Jerusalem, of seals with the inscription lmlk Hebron (to the king Hebron), Hebron continued to constitute an important local economic center, given its strategic position on the crossroads between the Dead Sea to the east, Jerusalem to the north, the Negev and Egypt to the south, and the Shepelah and the coastal plain to the west. Lying along trading routes, it remained administratively and politically dependent on Jerusalem for this period.\nAfter the destruction of the First Temple, most of the Jewish inhabitants of Hebron were exiled, and according to the conventional view, some researchers found traces of Edomite presence after the 5th–4th centuries BCE, as the area became Achaemenid province, and, in the wake of Alexander the Great's conquest, Hebron was throughout the Hellenistic period under the influence of Idumea (as the new area inhabited by the Edomites was called during the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman periods), as is attested by inscriptions for that period bearing names with the Edomite God Qōs. Jews also appear to have lived there after the return from the Babylonian exile (Nehemiah 11:25). During the Maccabean revolt, Hebron was burnt and plundered by Judah Maccabee who fought against the Edomites in 167 BCE. The city appears to have long resisted Hasmonean dominance, however, and indeed as late as the First Jewish–Roman War was still considered Idumean.\n\nRoman rule\nThe present day city of Hebron was settled in the valley downhill from Tel Rumeida at the latest by Roman times. Herod the Great, king of Judea, built the wall that still surrounds the Cave of the Patriarchs. During the First Jewish–Roman War, Hebron was captured and plundered by Simon Bar Giora, a leader of the Zealots, without bloodshed. The \"little town\" was later laid to waste by Vespasian's officer Sextus Vettulenus Cerialis. Josephus wrote that he \"slew all he found there, young and old, and burnt down the town\". After the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, innumerable Jewish captives were sold into slavery at Hebron's Terebinth slave-market.\nThe city was part of the Byzantine Empire in Palaestina Prima province at the Diocese of the East. The Byzantine emperor Justinian I erected a Christian church over the Cave of Machpelah in the 6th century CE, which was later destroyed by the Sassanid general Shahrbaraz in 614 when Khosrau II's armies besieged and took Jerusalem. Jews were not permitted to reside in Hebron under Byzantine rule. The sanctuary itself however was spared by the Persians, in deference to the Jewish population, who were numerous in the Sassanid army.\n\nMuslim conquest and Islamic caliphate\nHebron was one of the last cities of Palestine to fall to the Islamic invasion in the 7th century, possibly the reason why Hebron is not mentioned in any traditions of the Arab conquest. When the Rashidun Caliphate established its rule over Hebron in 638, the Muslims converted the Byzantine church at the site of Abraham's tomb into a mosque. It became an important station on the caravan trading route from Egypt, and also as a way-station for pilgrims making the yearly hajj from Damascus. After the fall of the city, Jerusalem's conqueror, Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab permitted Jewish people to return and to construct a small synagogue within the Herodian precinct.\nCatholic bishop Arculf, who visited the Holy Land during the Umayyad period, described the city as unfortified and poor. In his writings he also mentioned camel caravans transporting firewood from Hebron to Jerusalem, which implies there was a presence of Arab nomads in the region at that time. Trade greatly expanded, in particular with Bedouins in the Negev (al-Naqab) and the population to the east of the Dead Sea (Baḥr Lūṭ). According to Anton Kisa, Jews from Hebron (and Tyre) founded the Venetian glass industry in the 9th century.\nHebron was almost absent from Muslim literature before the 10th century. In 985, al-Muqaddasi described Hebron (Habra) as the village of Abraham al-Khalil, with a strong fortress and a stone dome over Abraham's sepulchre. The mosque contained the tombs of Isaac, Jacob, and their wives. Surrounding the area were villages with vineyards producing exceptional grapes and apples. Hebron had a public guest house offering lentils and olive oil to both the poor and the rich. The guest house was established through the bequest of Prophet Muhammad's companions, including Tamim-al Dari, and received generous donations. It was highly regarded as an excellent house of hospitality and charity in the realm of al-Islam. The custom, known as the 'Table of Abraham' (simāt al-khalil), was similar to the one established by the Fatimids. In 1047, Nasir-i-Khusraw described Hebron in his Safarnama as having many villages providing revenues for pious purposes. He mentioned a spring flowing from under a stone, with water channeled to a covered tank outside the town. The Sanctuary stood on the town's southern border, enclosed by four walls. Barley was the primary crop, with abundant olives. Visitors were provided with bread, olives, lentils cooked in olive oil, and raisins. Hebron had numerous mills operated by oxen and mules, along with working girls baking bread. The hospitality extended to about three-pound loaves of bread and meals for every arriving person, including up to 500 pilgrims on certain days.\nThe tradition survives to this day in the form of the Takiat Ibrahim soup kitchen, which has been active in providing food for thousands over Ramadan, which coincided with food shortages during the 2024 Gaza war. Geniza documents from this period mention  \"the graves of the patriarchs\" and attest to the presence of an organized Jewish community in Hebron. The Jews maintained a synagogue near the tomb and earned their livelihood accommodating Jewish pilgrims and merchants. During the Seljuk period, the community was headed by Saadia b. Abraham b. Nathan, known as the \"haver of the graves of the patriarchs.\"\n\nCrusader and Ayyubid period\nThe Caliphate lasted in the area until 1099, when the Christian Crusader Godfrey de Bouillon took Hebron and renamed it \"Castellion Saint Abraham\". It was designated capital of the southern district of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and given, in turn, as the fief of Saint Abraham, to Geldemar Carpinel, the bishop Gerard of Avesnes, Hugh of Rebecques, Walter Mohamet and Baldwin of Saint Abraham. As a Frankish garrison of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, its defense was precarious being 'little more than an island in a Moslem ocean'. The Crusaders converted the mosque and the synagogue into a church. In 1106, an Egyptian campaign thrust into southern Palestine and almost succeeded the following year in wresting Hebron back from the Crusaders under Baldwin I of Jerusalem, who personally led the counter-charge to beat the Muslim forces off. In the year 1113 during the reign of Baldwin II of Jerusalem, according to Ali of Herat (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and \"a number of Franks had made their entrance therein\". And they discovered \"(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob\", \"their shrouds having fallen to pieces, lying propped up against a wall...Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more\". Similar information is given in Ibn at Athir's Chronicle under the year 1119; \"In this year was opened the tomb of Abraham, and those of his two sons Isaac and Jacob ...Many people saw the Patriarch. Their limbs had nowise been disturbed, and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver.\" The Damascene nobleman and historian Ibn al-Qalanisi in his chronicle also alludes at this time to the discovery of relics purported to be those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a discovery that excited eager curiosity among all three communities in Palestine, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian. Towards the end of the period of Crusader rule, in 1166 Maimonides visited Hebron and wrote,On Sunday, 9 Marheshvan (October 17), I left Jerusalem for Hebron to kiss the tombs of my ancestors in the Cave. On that day, I stood in the cave and prayed, praise be to God, (in gratitude) for everything.\nA royal domain, Hebron was handed over to Philip of Milly in 1161 and joined with the Seigneurie of Transjordan. A bishop was appointed to Hebron in 1168 and the new cathedral church of St Abraham was built in the southern part of the Haram. In 1167, the episcopal see of Hebron was created along with that of Kerak and Sebastia (the tomb of John the Baptist). In 1170, Benjamin of Tudela visited Hebron, referred to as in its Frankish name St. Abram de Bron. He mentioned the great church called St. Abram, which was once a Jewish place of worship during the time of Muslim rule. The Gentiles had erected six tombs there, claimed to be those of Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah. The custodians collected money from pilgrims by presenting these tombs as the tombs of the Patriarchs. However, if a Jew offered a special reward, they would open an iron gate leading to a series of empty caves, until reaching the third cave where the actual sepulchers of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs were said to be located.\nThe Kurdish Muslim Saladin retook Hebron in 1187 – again with Jewish assistance according to one late tradition, in exchange for a letter of security allowing them to return to the city and build a synagogue there. The name of the city was changed back to Al-Khalil. A Kurdish quarter still existed in the town during the early period of Ottoman rule. Richard the Lionheart retook the city soon after. Richard of Cornwall, brought from England to settle the dangerous feuding between Templars and Hospitallers, whose rivalry imperiled the treaty guaranteeing regional stability stipulated with the Egyptian Sultan As-Salih Ayyub, managed to impose peace on the area. But soon after his departure, feuding broke out and in 1241 the Templars mounted a damaging raid on what was, by now, Muslim Hebron, in violation of agreements.\nIn 1244, the Khwarazmians destroyed the town, but left the sanctuary untouched.\n\nMamluk period\nIn 1260, after Mamluk Sultan Baibars defeated the Mongol army, the minarets were built onto the sanctuary. Six years later, while on pilgrimage to Hebron, Baibars promulgated an edict forbidding Christians and Jews from entering the sanctuary, and the climate became less tolerant of Jews and Christians than it had been under the prior Ayyubid rule. The edict for the exclusion of Christians and Jews was not strictly enforced until the middle of the 14th century and by 1490, not even Muslims were permitted to enter the caverns. The mill at Artas was built in 1307, and the profits from its income were dedicated to the hospital in Hebron. Between 1318 and 1320, the Na'ib of Gaza and much of coastal and interior Palestine ordered the construction of Jawli Mosque to enlarge the prayer space for worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque.\n\nHebron was visited by important rabbis over the next two centuries, among them Nachmanides (1270) and Ishtori HaParchi (1322) who noted the old Jewish cemetery there. Sunni imam Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350) was penalized by the religious authorities in Damascus for refusing to recognize Hebron as a Muslim pilgrimage site, a view also held by his teacher Ibn Taymiyyah. The Jewish-Italian traveler, Meshullam of Volterra (1481) found not more than twenty Jewish families living in Hebron. and recounted how the Jewish women of Hebron would disguise themselves with a veil in order to pass as Muslim women and enter the Cave of the Patriarchs without being recognized as Jews. Minute descriptions of Hebron were recorded in Stephen von Gumpenberg's Journal (1449), by Felix Fabri (1483) and by Mejr ed-Din It was in this period, also, that the Mamluk Sultan Qa'it Bay revived the old custom of the Hebron \"table of Abraham\", and exported it as a model for his own madrasa in Medina. This became an immense charitable establishment near the Haram, distributing daily some 1,200 loaves of bread to travelers of all faiths. The Italian rabbi Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura wrote around 1490:I was in the Cave of Machpelah, over which the mosque has been built; and the Arabs hold the place in high honour. All the Kings of the Arabs come here to repeat their prayers, but neither a Jew nor an Arab may enter the Cave itself, where the real graves of the Patriarchs are; the Arabs remain above, and let down burning torches into it through a window, for they keep a light always burning there. . Bread and lentil, or some other kind of pulse (seeds of peas or beans), is distributed (by the Muslims) to the poor every day without distinction of faith, and this is done in honour of Abraham.\n\nEarly Ottoman period\nThe expansion of the Ottoman Empire along the southern Mediterranean coast under sultan Selim I coincided with the establishment of Inquisition commissions by the Catholic Monarchs in Spain in 1478, which ended centuries of the Iberian convivencia (coexistence). The ensuing expulsions of the Jews drove many Sephardi Jews into the Ottoman provinces, and a slow influx of Jews to the Holy Land took place, with  notable Sephardi kabbalists settling in Hebron. Over the following two centuries, there was a significant migration of Bedouin tribal groups from the Arabian Peninsula into Palestine. Many settled in three separate villages in the Wādī al-Khalīl, and their descendants later formed the majority of Hebron.\nThe Jewish community fluctuated between 8–10 families throughout the 16th century, and suffered from severe financial straits in the first half of the century. In 1540, renowned kabbalist Malkiel Ashkenazi bought a courtyard from the small Karaite community, in which he established the Sephardic Abraham Avinu Synagogue. In 1659, Abraham Pereyra of Amsterdam founded the Hesed Le'Abraham yeshiva in Hebron, which attracted many students. In the early 18th century, the Jewish community suffered from heavy debts, almost quadrupling from 1717 to 1729, and were \"almost crushed\" from the extortion practiced by the Turkish pashas. In 1773 or 1775, a substantial amount of money was extorted from the Jewish community after a false allegation that the son of a local sheikh was murdered  and thrown into a cesspit. Emissaries from the community were frequently sent overseas to solicit funds. During the Ottoman period, the dilapidated patriarchs' tombs were restored to a semblance of  dignity. Ali Bey, in Muslim disguise, was one of the few Westerners to gain access.  In 1807 he reported that the sepulchres were covered with carpets of green silk embroidered in gold and those of the wives were covered in red silk.The sultans of Constantinople furnished these carpets, which were renewed from time to time. Ali Bey counted nine, one over the other, on the sepulchre of Abraham. Hebron also became known  for its glass production, based on Bedouin trade networks that brought up minerals from the Dead Sea. The industry is mentioned in travel literature in 19th century written by Western travelers to Palestine. Ulrich Jasper Seetzen noted during his travels in Palestine in 1808–09 that 150 persons were employed in the glass industry in Hebron, based on 26 kilns. In 1833, a report on the town  in the weekly paper of the London-based Religious Tract Society wrote that Hebron had numerous well-provisioned shops and  produced glass lamps which were exported to Egypt. Early 19th-century travelers also noted Hebron's flourishing agriculture. It was a major exporter of dibse, grape sugar, from the famous Dabookeh grapestock characteristic of Hebron.\n\nAn Arab peasants' revolt broke out in April 1834 when Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt announced he would recruit troops from the local Muslim population. Hebron, headed by its nazir Abd ar-Rahman Amr, declined to supply its quota of conscripts for the army and suffered badly from the Egyptian campaign to crush the uprising. The town was invested and, when its defenses fell on August 4, it was sacked by Ibrahim Pasha's army. An estimated 500 Muslims from Hebron were killed in the attack and some 750 were conscripted. 120 youths were abducted and put at the disposal of Egyptian army officers. Most of the Muslim population managed to flee beforehand to the hills. Many Jews fled to Jerusalem, but during the general pillage of the town at least five were killed.\nWhen the government of Ibrahim Pasha fell in 1841, the local clan leader Abd ar-Rahman Amr once again resumed the reins of power as the Sheik of Hebron. Due to his extortionate demands for cash from the local population, most of the Jewish population fled to Jerusalem. In 1846, the Ottoman Governor-in-chief of Jerusalem (serasker), Kıbrıslı Mehmed Emin Pasha, waged a campaign to subdue rebellious sheiks in the Hebron area, and while doing so, allowed his troops to sack the town. Though it was widely rumored that he secretly protected Abd ar-Rahman, the latter was deported together with other local leaders (such as Muslih al-'Azza of Bayt Jibrin), but he managed to return to the area in 1848.\nAccording to Hillel Cohen, the attacks on Jews in this particular period are an exception that proves the rule, that one of the easiest place for Jews to live in the world were in the various countries of the Ottoman Empire. In the mid-eighteenth century, rabbi Abraham Gershon of Kitov wrote from Hebron that:\"the gentiles here very much love the Jews. When there is a brit milah (circumcision ceremony) or any other celebration, their most important men come at night and rejoice with the Jews and clap hands and dance with the Jews, just like the Jews'.\"\n\nLate Ottoman period\nBy 1850, the Jewish population consisted of 45–60 Sephardic families, some 40 born in the town, and a 30-year-old Ashkenazic community of 50 families, mainly Polish and Russian, the Lubavitch Hasidic movement having established a community in 1823. The ascendency of Ibrahim Pasha led to a decline in the local glass industry. His plan to build a Mediterranean fleet led to severe logging in Hebron's forests, making firewood for the kilns  scarce. At the same time, Egypt began importing cheap European glass. The rerouting of the hajj from Damascus through Transjordan reduced traffic to Hebron, and the Suez Canal (1869) precipitated a drop in caravan trade. The consequence was a steady deterioration of the local economy. At the time, the town was divided into four quarters: the Ancient Quarter (Harat al-Kadim) near the Cave of Machpelah; to its south, the Quarter of the Silk Merchant (Harat al-Kazaz), inhabited by Jews; the Mamluk-era Sheikh's Quarter (Harat ash Sheikh) to the north-west; and further north, the Dense Quarter (Harat al-Harbah).In 1855, the newly appointed Ottoman pasha (\"governor\") of the sanjak (\"district\") of Jerusalem, Kamil Pasha, attempted to put down a  rebellion in the Hebron region. Kamil and his army marched towards Hebron in July 1855, a scene witnessed by representatives of the English, French and other Western consulates. After crushing all opposition, Kamil appointed Salama Amr, brother and rival of Abd al Rachman, as nazir of the Hebron region. Relative quiet reigned in the town for the next 4 years. In 1866, Hungarian Jews of the Karlin Hasidic court settled in Hebron. According to Nadav Shragai, Arab-Jewish relations were good, and Alter Rivlin, who spoke Arabic and Syrian-Aramaic, was appointed Jewish representative to the city council. During a  severe drought in 1869–1871,  food in Hebron sold for ten times the normal amount. From 1874, the Hebron district  was administered directly from Istanbul as part of the Sanjak of Jerusalem. By 1874, when C.R. Conder visited  Hebron under the auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund, the Jewish community numbered  600 in an overall population of 17,000. The Jews lived in the Quarter of the Corner Gate. In the late 19th century the production of Hebron glass declined due to competition from imported European glassware, although it continued to be popular among those who could not afford luxury goods  and was sold by Jewish merchants. Glass ornaments from Hebron were exhibited at the World Fair of 1873 in Vienna.\nA report from the consul of the French Consulate in Jerusalem in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained an important source of income for Hebron, with four factories earning 60,000 francs yearly. While the economy of other cities in Palestine was based on solely on trade, the economy of Hebron was more diverse, including agriculture and livestock herding, along with glassware manufacturing and processing of hides. This was because the most fertile lands were situated within the city limits. Even so, Hebron had an image of being  unproductive and  an \"asylum for the poor and the spiritual\". While the wealthy merchants of Nablus built fine mansions, housing in Hebron consisted of semi-peasant dwellings.\nHebron was described as 'deeply Bedouin and Islamic', and 'bleakly conservative' in its religious outlook, with a strong tradition of hostility to Jews. It had a reputation for religious zeal in jealously protecting its sites from Jews and Christians, although  the Jewish and Christian communities seem to have been an integral part of  the local economy. As income from commerce declined and tax revenues diminished significantly, the Ottoman government left Hebron to manage its own affairs for the most part, making it \"one of the most autonomous regions in late Ottoman Palestine.\" The Jewish community was under French protection until 1914. The Jewish presence itself was divided between the traditional Sephardi community, whose members spoke Arabic and adopted Arab dress, and the more recent influx of Ashkenazi Jews. They prayed in different synagogues, sent their children to different schools, lived in different quarters and did not intermarry. The community was largely Orthodox and anti-Zionist.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nThe British occupied Hebron on December 8, 1917; governance transited to a mandate in 1920. Most of Hebron was owned by old Islamic charitable endowments (waqfs), with about 60% of all the land in and around Hebron belonging to the Tamīm al-Dārī waqf. During the 1920s, Abd al-Ḥayy al-Khaṭīb was appointed Mufti of Hebron. Before his appointment, he had been a staunch opponent of Haj Amin, supported the Muslim National Associations and had good contacts with the Zionists. Later, al-Khaṭīb became one of the few loyal followers of Haj Amin in Hebron. During the late Ottoman period, a new ruling elite had emerged in Palestine. They later formed the core of the growing Arab nationalist movement in the early 20th century. During the Mandate period, delegates from Hebron constituted only 1 percent of the political leadership. The Palestinian Arab decision to boycott the 1923 elections for a Legislative Council was made at the fifth Palestinian Congress, after it was reported by Murshid Shahin (an Arab pro-Zionist activist) that there was intense resistance in Hebron to the elections. Almost no house in Hebron remained undamaged when an earthquake struck Palestine on July 11, 1927.\nThe Cave of the Patriarchs continued to remain officially closed to non-Muslims, and reports that entry to the site had been relaxed in 1928 were denied by the Supreme Muslim Council.\nAt this time following attempts by the Lithuanian government to draft yeshiva students into the army, the Lithuanian Hebron Yeshiva (Knesses Yisroel) relocated to Hebron, after consultations between Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, Yechezkel Sarna and Moshe Mordechai Epstein. and by 1929 had attracted some 265 students from Europe and the United States. The majority of the Jewish population lived on the outskirts of Hebron along the roads to Be'ersheba and Jerusalem, renting homes owned by Arabs, a number of which were built for the express purpose of housing Jewish tenants, with a few dozen within the city around the synagogues. During the 1929 Hebron massacre, Arab rioters slaughtered some 64 to 67 Jewish men, women and children and wounded 60, and Jewish homes and synagogues were ransacked; 435 Jews survived by virtue of the shelter and assistance offered them by their Arab neighbors, who hid them. Some Hebron Arabs, including Ahmad Rashid al-Hirbawi, president of Hebron chamber of commerce, supported the return of Jews after the massacre. Two years later, 35 families moved back into the ruins of the Jewish quarter, but on the eve of the Palestinian Arab revolt (April 23, 1936) the British Government decided to move the Jewish community out of Hebron as a precautionary measure to secure its safety. The sole exception was the 8th generation Hebronite Ya'akov ben Shalom Ezra, who processed dairy products in the city, blended in well with its social landscape and resided there under the protection of friends. In November 1947, in anticipation of the UN partition vote, the Ezra family closed its shop and left the city. Yossi Ezra has since tried to regain his family's property through the Israeli courts.\n\nJordanian occupation\nAt the beginning of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt took control of Hebron. Between May and October, Egypt and Jordan tussled for dominance in Hebron and its environs. Both countries appointed military governors in the town, hoping to gain recognition from Hebron officials. The Egyptians managed to persuade the pro-Jordanian mayor to support their rule, at least superficially, but local opinion turned against them when they imposed taxes. Villagers surrounding Hebron resisted and skirmishes broke out in which some were killed. By late 1948, part of the Egyptian forces from Bethlehem to Hebron had been cut off from their lines of supply and Glubb Pasha sent 350 Arab Legionnaires and an armored car unit to Hebron to reinforce them there. When the Armistice was signed, the city thus fell under Jordanian military control. The armistice agreement between Israel with Jordan intended to allow Israeli Jewish pilgrims to visit Hebron, but, as Jews of all nationalities were forbidden by Jordan into the country, this did not occur.\nIn December 1948, the Jericho Conference, held by Jordan, was convened to decide the future of the West Bank. Hebron notables, headed by mayor Muhamad 'Ali al-Ja'bari, voted in favor of becoming part of Jordan and to recognize Abdullah I of Jordan as their king. The subsequent unilateral annexation benefited the Arabs of Hebron, who during the 1950s, played a significant role in the economic development of Jordan.\nAlthough a significant number of people relocated to Jerusalem from Hebron during the Jordanian period, Hebron itself saw a considerable increase in population with 35,000 settling in the town. During this period, signs of the previous Jewish presence in Hebron were removed.\n\nIsraeli period\nAfter the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israel occupied Hebron along with the rest of the West Bank, establishing a military government to rule the area. In an attempt to reach a land for peace deal, Yigal Allon proposed that Israel annex 45% of the West Bank and return the remainder to Jordan. According to the Allon Plan, the city of Hebron would lie in Jordanian territory, and in order to determine Israel's own border, Allon suggested building a Jewish settlement adjacent to Hebron. David Ben-Gurion also considered that Hebron was the one sector of the conquered territories that should remain under Jewish control and be open to Jewish settlement. Apart from its symbolic message to the international community that Israel's rights in Hebron were, according to Jews, inalienable, settling Hebron also had theological significance in some quarters. For some, the capture of Hebron by Israel had unleashed a messianic fervor.Survivors and descendants of the prior community are mixed. Some support the project of Jewish redevelopment, others commend living in peace with Hebronite Arabs, while a third group recommend a full pullout. Descendants supporting the latter views have met with Palestinian leaders in Hebron. In 1997 one group of descendants dissociated themselves from the settlers by calling them an obstacle to peace. On May 15, 2006, a member of a group who is a direct descendant of the 1929 refugees urged the government to continue its support of Jewish settlement, and allow the return of eight families evacuated the previous January from homes they set up in emptied shops near the Avraham Avinu neighborhood. Beit HaShalom, established in 2007 under disputed circumstances, was under court orders permitting its forced evacuation. All the Jewish settlers were expelled on December 3, 2008.\n\nImmediately after the 1967 war, mayor al-Ja'bari had unsuccessfully promoted the creation of an autonomous Palestinian entity in the West Bank, and by 1972, he was advocating for a confederal arrangement with Jordan instead. al-Ja'bari nevertheless consistently fostered a conciliatory policy towards Israel. He was ousted by Fahad Qawasimi in the 1976 mayoral election, which marked a shift in support towards pro-PLO nationalist leaders. Supporters of Jewish settlement within Hebron see their program as the reclamation of an important heritage dating back to Biblical times, which was dispersed or, it is argued, stolen by Arabs after the massacre of 1929. The purpose of settlement is to return to the 'land of our forefathers', and the Hebron model of reclaiming sacred sites in Palestinian territories has pioneered a pattern for settlers in Bethlehem and Nablus. Many reports, foreign and Israeli, are sharply critical of the behavior of Hebronite settlers.\n\nSheik Farid Khader heads the Ja'bari tribe, consisting of some 35,000 people, which is considered one of the most important tribes in Hebron. For years, members of the Ja'bari tribe were the mayors of Hebron. Khader regularly meets with settlers and Israeli government officials and is a strong opponent of both the concept of Palestinian State and the Palestinian Authority itself. Khader believes that Jews and Arabs must learn to coexist. A violent episode occurred May 2, 1980, when an Al Fatah squad killed five yeshiva students and one other person on their way home from Sabbath prayer at the Tomb of the Patriarchs. The event provided a major motivation for settlers near Hebron to join the Jewish Underground.\nIn the 1980s Hebron, became the center of the Jewish Kach movement, a designated terrorist organization, whose first operations started there, and provided a model for similar behavior in other settlements. On July 26, 1983, Israeli settlers attacked the Islamic University and shot three people dead and injured over thirty others. The 1994 Shamgar Commission of Inquiry concluded that Israeli authorities had consistently failed to investigate or prosecute crimes committed by settlers against Palestinians. Hebron IDF commander Noam Tivon said that his foremost concern is to \"ensure the security of the Jewish settlers\" and that Israeli \"soldiers have acted with the utmost restraint and have not initiated any shooting attacks or violence\".\n\nOslo Accords\nHebron was the one city excluded from the interim agreement of September 1995 to restore rule over all Palestinian West Bank cities to the Palestinian Authority. IDF soldiers see their job as being to protect Israeli settlers from Palestinian residents, not to police the Israeli settlers. IDF soldiers are instructed to leave violent Israeli settlers for the police to deal with. Since The Oslo Agreement, violent episodes have been recurrent in the city. The Cave of the Patriarchs massacre took place on February 25, 1994, when Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli physician and resident of Kiryat Arba, opened fire on Muslims at prayer in the Cave of the Patriarchs, killing 29, and wounding 125 before the survivors overcame and killed him. Standing orders for Israeli soldiers on duty in Hebron disallowed them from firing on fellow Jews, even if they were shooting Arabs. This event was condemned by the Israeli Government, and the extreme right-wing Kach party was banned as a result. The Israeli government also tightened restrictions on the movement of Palestinians in H2, closed their vegetable and meat markets, and banned Palestinian cars on Al-Shuhada Street. The park near the Cave of the Patriarchs for recreation and barbecues is off-limits for Arab Hebronites. Following the 1995 Oslo Agreement and subsequent 1997 Hebron Agreement, Palestinian cities were placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, with the exception of Hebron, which was split into two sectors: H1 is controlled by the Palestinian Authority and H2 – which includes the Old City of Hebron – remained under the military control of Israel. Around 120,000 Palestinians live in H1, while around 30,000 Palestinians along with around 700 Israelis remain under Israeli military control in H2. As of 2009, a total of 86 Jewish families lived in Hebron. The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) may not enter H1 unless under Palestinian escort. Palestinians cannot approach areas where settlers live without special permits from the IDF. The Jewish settlement is widely considered to be illegal by the international community, although the Israeli government disputes this.\n\nOver the period of the First Intifada and Second Intifada, the Jewish community was subjected to attacks by Palestinian militants, especially during the periods of the intifadas; which saw 3 fatal stabbings and 9 fatal shootings in between the first and second Intifada (0.9% of all fatalities in Israel and the West Bank) and 17 fatal shootings (9 soldiers and 8 settlers) and 2 fatalities from a bombing during the second Intifada, and thousands of rounds fired on it from the hills above the Abu-Sneina and Harat al-Sheikh neighborhoods. On November 15, 2002, 12 Israeli soldiers were killed (Hebron Brigade commander Colonel Dror Weinberg and two other officers, 6 soldiers and 3 members of the security unit of Kiryat Arba) in an ambush. Two Temporary International Presence in Hebron observers were killed by Palestinian gunmen in a shooting attack on the road to Hebron On March 27, 2001, a Palestinian sniper targeted and killed the Jewish baby Shalhevet Pass. The sniper was caught in 2002. Hebron is one of the three West Bank towns from which the majority of suicide bombers originate. In May 2003, three students of the Hebron Polytechnic University carried out three separate suicide attacks. In August 2003, in what both Islamic groups described as a retaliation, a 29-year-old preacher from Hebron, Raed Abdel-Hamed Mesk, broke a unilateral Palestinian ceasefire by killing 23 and injured over 130 in a bus bombing in Jerusalem. In 2007, the Palestinian population in H2 declined due to Israeli security measures such as extended curfews, strict restrictions on movement, the closure of Palestinian businesses and settler harassment. Palestinians are barred from using Al-Shuhada Street, a principal commercial thoroughfare that is locally nicknamed \"Apartheid Street\" as a result.\n\nIsraeli organization B'Tselem states that there have been \"grave violations\" of Palestinian human rights in Hebron because of the \"presence of the settlers within the city\". The organization cites regular incidents of \"almost daily physical violence and property damage by settlers in the city\", curfews and restrictions of movement that are \"among the harshest in the Occupied Territories\", and violence by Israeli border policemen and the IDF against Palestinians who live in the city's H2 sector. According to Human Rights Watch, Palestinian areas of Hebron are frequently subject to indiscriminate firing by the IDF, leading to many casualties. One former IDF soldier, with experience in policing Hebron, has testified to Breaking the Silence, that on the briefing wall of his unit a sign describing their mission aim was hung that read: \"To disrupt the routine of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood.\" Hebron mayor Mustafa Abdel Nabi invited the Christian Peacemaker Teams to assist the local Palestinian community in opposition to what they describe as Israeli military occupation, collective punishment, settler harassment, home demolitions and land expropriation. In 2017, Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) issued a confidential report covering their 20 years of work in Hebron. The report, based in part on over 40,000 incidents reported during this period, stated that Israel violated international law in Hebron and has breached the rights of residents as established by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The report claimed that Israel  violated Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits the deportation of civilians from occupied territory. Israeli settlement in Hebron was also cited as a violation.\n\nGeography\nHebron is situated on the southern West Bank. Nestled in the Judaean Mountains, it lies 930 meters (3,050 ft) above sea level. Hebron is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south of Jerusalem, 60.1 kilometers (37.3 mi) east of Gaza, 43 kilometers (27 mi) northeast of Beersheba and 68.4 kilometers (42.5 mi) southeast of Tel Aviv, both in Israel and 89.8 kilometers (55.8 mi) northeast of Amman, Jordan. The city is surrounded by Bani Na'im and Dura to the east, Halhul to the north, Taffuh to the west and Yatta to the south. The Israeli–controlled H2 region is located in the eastern region of the city.\nIt is one of the highest cities in the area and was, until the 19th century, considered the highest city in the Middle East. With the governorate and metropolitan area, it forms about 19% of the West Bank total area. The city is surrounded by several mountains and hills, including the Hebron Hills (Jabal al–Khalil) and Mount Nabi Yunis. The Mount Nabi Yunis, situated north of the city, is the highest point in Palestine, with an altitude of 1,030 meters (3,380 ft). While the Hebron Hills is southern part of the wider Judaean Mountains, which spreads throughout Israel and Palestine and have an altitude of 1,026 m (3,366 ft). The two larger settlements whose population exceeds 7000 sit on the hills overlooking the Hebron's eastern quarters – Kirayt Arba and Givat Harsina. Wadi al–Quff near Hebron is one of the largest natural reserves in Palestine. Located towards northeast of the city, it is surrounded by nearby towns and villages of Tarqumia, Halhoul, Beit Kahel and Beit Ola. The natural reserve covers up an area of 3.73 square kilometers (920 acres). Wadi al–Quff Natural reserve is home to some of the rare species of animals and plants.\nHebron is located on fertile mountainous area, making the city agriculturally rich, thus giving it a strategic importance. This is the reason for Hebron, today being a hub for cultivation of fruits and vineyards. The alternative sources of water network is cisterns. There are ten springs and three wells in the city. The water of springs and wells are not currently used. The Hebron River (Wadi al–Khalil), known as Nahal Hebron in Hebrew located along the region of Judea and Negev, is one of the water sources for the city. Currently the river is polluted, mainly due to the generation of waste, mostly by the industrial areas, situated on the city's east and south.\n\nClimate\nThe climate in Hebron is temperate and the mean year-round temperature ranges between 15 and 16° (an average of 7° in winter and 21° in summer). Annual precipitations average around 502 mm. Hebron has a Mediterranean, hot summer climate (Classification: Csa). The city's yearly temperature is 22.74 °C (72.93 °F) and it is 0.14% higher than Palestine's averages. It typically receives about 15.72 millimeters (0.62 inches) of precipitation and has 39.47 rainy days (10.81% of the time) annually, during January and February.\n\nUrban development\nHistorically, the city consisted of four densely populated quarters: the suq and Harat al-Masharqa adjacent to the Ibrahimi Mosque, the Silk Merchant Quarter (Haret Kheitun) to the south and the Sheikh Quarter (Haret al-Sheikh) to the north. It is believed the basic urban structure of the city had been established by the Mamluk period, during which time the city also had Jewish, Christian and Kurdish quarters.\nIn the mid 19th-century, Hebron was still divided into four quarters, but the Christian quarter had disappeared. The sections included the ancient quarter surrounding the Cave of Machpelah, the Haret Kheitun (the Jewish Quarter, Haret el-Yahud), the Haret el-Sheikh and the Druze Quarter. As Hebron's population gradually increased, inhabitants preferred to build upwards rather than leave the safety of their neighborhoods. By the 1880s, better security provided by the Ottoman authorities allowed the town to expand and a new commercial center, Bab el-Zawiye, emerged. As development continued, new spacious and taller structures were built to the north-west. In 1918, the town consisted of dense clusters of residential dwellings along the valley, rising onto the slopes above it. By the 1920s, the town was made up of seven quarters: el-Sheikh and Bab el-Zawiye to the west, el-Kazzazin, el-Akkabi and el-Haram in the center, el-Musharika to the south and el-Kheitun in the east. Urban sprawl had spread onto the surrounding hills by 1945. \n\nThe large population increase under Jordanian rule resulted in about 1,800 new houses being built, most of them along the Hebron-Jerusalem highway, stretching northwards for over 3 miles (5 km) at a depth of 600 ft (200m) either way. Some 500 houses were built elsewhere on surrounding rural land. There was less development to the south-east, where housing units extended along the valley for about 1 mile (1.5 km). In 1971, with the assistance of the Israeli and Jordanian governments, the Hebron University, an Islamic university, was founded. In an attempt to enhance the view of the Ibrahami Mosque, Jordan demolished whole blocks of ancient houses opposite its entrance, which also resulted in improved access to the historic site. The Jordanians also demolished the old synagogue located in the el-Kazzazin Quarter. In 1976, Israel recovered the site, which had been converted into an animal pen, and by 1989, a settler courtyard had been established there.\nToday, the area along the north–south axis to the east comprises the modern city of Hebron (also called Upper Hebron, Khalil Foq). It was established towards the end of the Ottoman period, its inhabitants being upper and middle class Hebronites who moved there from the crowded old city, Balde al-Qadime (also called Lower Hebron, Khalil Takht). The northern part of Upper Hebron includes some up-scale residential districts and also houses the Hebron University, private hospitals and the only two luxury hotels in the city. The main commercial artery of the city is located here, situated along the Jerusalem Road, and includes modern multi-storey shopping malls. Also in this area are villas and apartment complexes built on the krum, rural lands and vineyards, which used to function as recreation areas during the summer months until the early Jordanian period. The southern part is where the working-class neighborhoods are located, along with large industrial zones and the Hebron Polytechnic University. The main municipal and governmental buildings are located in the center of the city. This area includes high-rise concrete and glass developments and also some distinct Ottoman era one-storey family houses, adorned with arched entrances, decorative motifs and ironwork. Hebron's domestic appliance and textile markets are located here along two parallel roads that lead to the entrance of the old city. Many of these have been relocated from the old commercial center of the city, known as the vegetable market (hesbe), which was closed down by the Israeli military during the 1990s. The vegetable market is now located in the square of Bab el-Zawiye.\n\nDemographics\nHebron has, historically, been an Arab city but a small Jewish community has existed since the 16th century, encouraged to settle there by the Ottoman authorities following the expulsion of Jews from Spain. In 1820, it was reported that there were about 1,000 Jews in Hebron. In 1838, the total population was estimated at 10,000, including an estimated 1,500 taxable Muslim households, and to 41 Jewish taxpayers. Taxpayers consisted here of male heads of households who owned even a very small shop or piece of land. 200 Jews and one Christian household were under 'European protections'. In 1842, it was estimated that about 400 Arab and 120 Jewish families lived in Hebron, the Jews having been diminished in number following the destruction of 1834. Its population stood at 16,577 in 1922 of which 16,074 (97%) were Muslim, 430 (2.5%) were Jewish and 73 (0.4%) were Christian.\nThe Jewish community was expelled from the city following the massacre of nearly 70 Jews in 1929. However, since Israel gained control of the West Bank in 1967, Hebron and eastern Jerusalem have been the only cities in the region to receive Jewish settlement.\nHebron had a population of 201,063 Palestinians in 2017, and seven hundred Jewish settlers concentrated on the outskirts of its Old City. Roughly 20% of the city, including 35,000 Palestinians, under Israeli military administration, lives in the region of H2 Hebron. The surrounding area forms the Hebron metropolitan area, with an estimated population of around 782,227 as of 2021. It is third largest metropolitan area in Palestine, after Gaza and Jerusalem.\nHebron is also home to several ethnic minority and foreign diaspora communities. Kurds have been living in the city since Saladin's conquest of Palestine. Along with Jerusalem and Gaza, the city is also home to Palestinians of Kurdish descent. Nearly a third of the population of Hebron, is considered to be of Kurdish background. The Kurdish Quarter, known as Harat al-Akrad, still exists today. Hebron is also home to a small Samaritan community, after Nablus.\n\nEconomy\nHebron is a leading commercial and industrial center in the Levantine region. The presence of minerals and resources in surroundings have increased the city's value. It emerged as in important trade hub in the West Bank. Hebron is most productive region in the country after Jerusalem–Bethlehem–Ramallah area. The H1 Area, which is under control of Palestinian Authority have been a large contributor to the city's economy. Despite having tense relations, Israelis and Palestinians have strong trade relations in Hebron. The city is popular for its ceramics and glass industry.\n\nIt is the source of 60% of stone and marble resources in the West Bank. 33% of the Palestine's GNP is from Hebron, including 60% of the jewelry industry and jewelry production, 28% of the output in the agricultural sector and 75% of the leather and shoe industry. Most agricultural products from Palestinian controlled Hebron are sent to Israel. Trade volume between Israel and the Palestine reaches $30 billion annually and the city trades with China as well. The minimum wage is 50 NIS per day versus an average of 30 NIS per day in other Palestinian areas. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, a third of those who lived in the city worked in the shoe industry. According to the shoe factory owner Tareq Abu Felat, the number reached least 35,000 people and there were more than 1,000 workshops around the city. Statistics from the Chamber of Commerce in Hebron put the figure at 40,000 people employed in 1,200 shoe businesses. However, the 1993 Oslo Accords and 1994 Paris Protocol between Israel and the PLO made it possible to mass import Chinese goods as the Palestinian National Authority, which was created after the Oslo Accords, did not regulate it. They later put import taxes but the Abu Felat, who also is the Palestinian Federation of Leather Industries's chairman, said more is still needed. The Palestinian government decided to impose an additional tax of 35% on products from China from April 2013.\n90% of the shoes in Palestine are now estimated to come from China, which Palestinian industry workers say are of much lower quality but also much cheaper, and the Chinese are more aesthetic. Another factor contributing to the decline of the local industry is Israeli restrictions on Palestinian exports. Today, there are less than 300 workshops in the shoe industry, who only run part-time, and they employ around 3,000–4,000 people. More than 50% of the shoes are exported to Israel, where consumers have a better economy. Less than 25% goes to the Palestinian market, with some going to Jordan, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries.\n\nThe most advanced printing press in the Middle East is in Hebron. Hebron is major source of import goods to Israel. Mattresses manufactured in Hebron are exported to Israeli markets in Tel Aviv, Beersheba and Haifa. Around 17,000 factories and workshops are located throughout the Area H1. Historically, the traditional glass industry is popular in Hebron. A new industrial city has been built in Tarqumiyah, which houses more than 140 factories. Royal Industrial Trading operates a pipe manufacturing plant in Hebron, which is spread across an area of 40,000 square meters (9.9 acres) and employs over 650 people. In 2021, an electronic recycling factory was opened in Idhna and operates to this day. The European Union and the World Bank proposed to construct a regional water treatment plant, which will treat existing sewage stream coming from 80% of the city. The city is a hub for the jewelry industry and houses approximately 70 jewelry factories employing over 1500 workers.\nSuper Nimer company manufactures sanitary ware products and water network from its factory, whose area ranges from 30,000 square meters (7.4 acres) to 45,000 square meters (11 acres). Opened in 2004, Super Tiger operates a factory spread across an area of 7 acres (28,000 m2). During the COVID-19 pandemic in the State of Palestine, Hebron rapidly transformed into a medical supplies manufacturing hub, with numerous factories installing and commissioning new production lines for the product and was approved by the Ministry of National Economy.\n\nPolitical status\nUnder the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine passed by the UN in 1947, Hebron was envisaged to become part of an Arab state. While the Jewish leaders accepted the partition plan, the Arab leadership (the Arab Higher Committee in Palestine and the Arab League) rejected it, opposing any partition. The aftermath of the 1948 war saw the city occupied and later unilaterally annexed by the kingdom of Jordan in a move supported by local Hebron officials. Following the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel occupied Hebron. In 1997, in accordance with the Hebron Agreement, Israel withdrew from 80 percent of Hebron, which was handed over to the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian police would assume responsibilities in Area H1 and Israel would retain control in Area H2.\nAn international unarmed observer force—the Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) was subsequently established to help the normalization of the situation and to maintain a buffer between the Palestinian Arab population of the city and the Jewish population residing in their enclave in the old city. The TIPH operates with the permission of the Israeli government, meeting regularly with the Israeli army and the Israeli Civil Administration, and is granted free access throughout the city. In 2018, the TIPH came under criticism in Israel due to incidents where an employee was, according to the Israeli police, filmed puncturing the tires of the car of an Israeli settler, and another instance where an observer was deported after slapped a settler boy.\nThe post-1967 settlement in Hebron was driven by theological doctrines from the Mercaz HaRav Kook, which consider the Land of Israel and its people as holy, and believe that the messianic Age of Redemption has arrived. Hebron holds special significance in this narrative, with traditions linking it to Abraham, King David, and the entrance to the Garden of Eden. Settling in Hebron is seen as a right and duty, a favor to the world, and an example of being \"a light unto the nations\" (Or la-Goyim).  This viewpoint has resulted in numerous violent clashes with Palestinians, which some settlers see as contributing to the messianic process.\n\nOccupation and settlements\nIn 1968, Rabbi Moshe Levinger and a group of Israelis, disguised as tourists, rented the main hotel in Hebron and refused to leave. The government initially wanted to evacuate the settlers but eventually allowed them to relocate to a nearby military base, which became the settlement of Kiryat Arba. After lobbying efforts, the settlement gained support from some Israeli leaders. Over time, the settlement expanded with the outpost Givat Ha'avot. The operation was planned and financed by the Movement for Greater Israel. In 2011, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that Jews have no right to properties they possessed in places like Hebron before 1948 and are not entitled to compensation for their losses. Originally named Hesed l'Avraham, Beit Hadassah was constructed in 1893 with donations of Baghdadi Jewish families and was the only modern medical facility in Hebron. In 1909, it was renamed after Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America, which took responsibility for the medical staff and provided free medical care to all. In 1979, a group of 15 settler mothers and their 35 children squatted in the Dabouia building in Hebron, exploiting the government's indecision during negotiations with Egypt. Led by Miriam Levinger, they established a bridgehead for Jewish resettlement and created conflict with Arab shopkeepers. A retaliatory attack by a Palestinian group resulted in the death of six yeshiva students. Despite appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court, the settlers remained. The following year, the government legitimized residency in Hebron and expelled the elected mayor. This pattern of settlement followed by hostilities with Palestinians was repeated in Tel Rumeida.\nThe Abraham Avinu Synagogue was the physical and spiritual center of its neighborhood and regarded as one of the most beautiful synagogues in Palestine. It was the center of Jewish worship in Hebron until it was burnt down during the 1929 riots. In 1948 under Jordanian rule, the remaining ruins were razed. The Avraham Avinu quarter was established next to the Vegetable and Wholesale Markets on Al-Shuhada Street in the south of the Old City. The vegetable market was closed by the Israeli military and some of the neighboring houses were occupied by settlers and soldiers. Settlers started to take over the closed Palestinian stores, despite explicit orders of the Israeli Supreme Court that the settlers should vacate these stores and the Palestinians should be allowed to return. Beit Romano was built and owned by Yisrael Avraham Romano of Constantinople and served Sephardi Jews from Turkey. In 1901, a yeshiva was established there with a dozen teachers and up to 60 students. In 1982, Israeli authorities took over a Palestinian education office (Osama Ben Munqez School) and the adjacent bus station. The school was turned into a settlement, and the bus station into a military base against an order of the Israeli Supreme Court. In 1807 the immigrant Sephardic Rabbi Haim Yeshua Hamitzri (Haim the Jewish Egyptian) purchased 5 dunams on the outskirts of the city and in 1811 he signed a contract for a 99-year lease on a further 800 dunams of land, which included 4 plots in Tel Rumeida. The plots were administered by his descendant Haim Bajaio after Jews left Hebron. Settlers' claims to this land are based on these precedents, but are dismissed by the rabbi's heir. In 1984, settlers established a caravan outpost there called Ramat Yeshai. In 1998, the government recognized it as a settlement, and in 2001 the Defence Minister approved the building of the first housing units.\nIn 2012, Israel Defense Forces called for the immediate removal of a new settlement, because it was seen as a provocation. The IDF, in accordance with settler demands, requested the removal of a Palestinian flag on a Hebronite rooftop contiguous to settlements, though no rule forbids the practice. According to Palestinians, the IDF negotiated the removal of the flag in exchange for the release of a resident of Hebron from legal custody. In August 2016, Israel announced its intention to allow settlement building in the military compound of Plugat Hamitkanim in Hebron, which had been expropriated for military purposes in the 1990s. In late 2019, the Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett instructed the military administration to inform the Palestinian municipality of the government's intention to reconstruct infrastructure in the old Hebron fruit and vegetable market in order to establish a Jewish neighborhood there, which would allow for doubling the city's settler population. The area's original residents, who have protected tenancy rights there, were compelled to evacuate the zone after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. The original site was under Jewish ownership prior to 1948. The plan proposes that the empty shops remain Palestinian while the units built over them house Jewish Israelis.\n\nCulture\nTourism\nHebron is home to numerous mosques, synagogues, churches, parks, palaces, castles and forts. The Old City of Hebron was a declared a Palestinian World Heritage Site by UNESCO on July 7, 2017. The move caused controversies and faced opposition from Israeli officials who objected to it being called as Palestinian site, instead of Israeli. It is one of the best preserved sites of the Mamluk era.\n\nThe most famous site in Hebron is the Cave of the Patriarchs. The Herodian era structure is said to enclose the tombs of the biblical Patriarchs and Matriarchs. The site is known for the burial place of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca and Leah respectively. The Isaac Hall now serves as the Ibrahimi mosque, while the Abraham and Jacob Hall serve as a synagogue.\nThe tombs of other biblical figures – Abner ben Ner, Otniel ben Kenaz, Ruth and Jesse are also located in the city. It is reverred to Christians, Muslims and Jews. These sites are located in the H2 region, which is controlled by the Israeli authorities.\nThe early Ottoman-era Abraham Avinu Synagogue in the city's historic Jewish Quarter was built in 1540 and restored in 1738.\nMosques from the era include the Sheikh Ali al-Bakka and Al-Jawali mosque.\nHebron is also home to several sites for Christian worship, with numerous churches located around the city. The Oak of Sibta (Oak of Abraham) is an ancient tree which, in non-Jewish tradition, is said to mark the place where Abraham pitched his tent. The Russian Orthodox Church owns the site and the nearby Abraham's Oak Holy Trinity Monastery, consecrated in 1925. Hebron is one of the few cities to have preserved its Mamluk architecture. Many structures were built during the period, especially Sufi zawiyas.\nOther sites:\n\nSituated on the northeast of the city, Wadi al–Quff Natural Reserve is visited by 2,000 people, mostly on weekends. It is currently under the management of the Palestinian government.\nAristobolia (Khirbet Istanbul), in south of Hebron, near Zif village, is home to Byzantine-era basilica, built during the beginning of Islamic era.\nKhirbet al–Karmil is home to Crusader pool, ruined Byzantine church and Crusader fortress.\nAs-Samu is an ancient biblical village, currently a modern town. It is home to 4th century synagogue, numerous Ottoman-era structure and an Islamic building, probably built during the time of Saladin of the Ayyubid dynasty.\n\nReligious traditions\nSome Jewish traditions regarding Adam place him in Hebron after his expulsion from Eden. Another has Cain kill Abel there. A third has Adam and Eve buried in the cave of Machpelah. A Jewish-Christian tradition had it that Adam was formed from the red clay of the field of Damascus, near Hebron. A tradition arose in medieval Jewish texts that the Cave of the Patriarchs itself was the very entrance to the Garden of Eden. During the Middle Ages, pilgrims and the inhabitants of Hebron would eat the red earth as a charm against misfortune. Others report that the soil was harvested for export as a precious medicinal spice in Egypt, Arabia, Ethiopia and India and that the earth refilled after every digging. Legend also tells that Noah planted his vineyard on Mount Hebron. In medieval Christian tradition, Hebron was one of the three cities where Elizabeth was said to live, the legend implying that it might have been the birthplace of John the Baptist.\nOne Islamic tradition has it that Muhammad alighted in Hebron during his night journey from Mecca to Jerusalem, and the mosque in the city is said to conserve one of his shoes. Another tradition states that Muhammad arranged for Hebron and its surrounding villages to become part of Tamim al-Dari's domain; this was implemented during Umar's reign as caliph. According to the arrangement, al-Dari and his descendants were only permitted to tax the residents for their land and the waqf of the Ibrahimi Mosque was entrusted to them. The simat al-Khalil or \"Table of Abraham\" is attested to in the writings of the 11th century Persian traveler Nasir-i Khusraw. According to the account, this early Islamic food distribution center — which predates the Ottoman imarets — gave all visitors to Hebron a loaf of bread, a bowl of lentils in olive oil, and some raisins.\nAccording to Tamara Neuman, settlement by a community of Jewish religious fundamentalists has brought about three major changes by redesigning a Palestinian area in terms of biblical imagery and origins: remaking over these revamped religious sites to endow them with an innovative centrality to Jewish worship, that, she argues, effectively erases the diasporic thrust of Jewish tradition; and writing out the overlapping aspects of Judaism, Christianity and Islam in such a way that the possibility of accommodation between the three intertwined traditions is eradicated, while the presence of Palestinians themselves is erased by violent methods.\n\nGallery\nTwin towns / sister cities\nHebron is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nShabab Al-Khalil SC, the town's football team\nPalestinian Child Arts Center\nList of burial places of biblical figures\nList of people from Hebron\nOak of Mamre, Christian holy site, historically near Hebron but now inside the city, distinct from the Terebinth of Mamre\nAbraham's Oak Holy Trinity Monastery, Russian Orthodox monastery at the \"Oak of Mamre\"\n\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\nExternal links\n\nwww.hebron-city.ps\nPhotographs of Hebron\nenglish Hebron.com – English\nCollection of Palestinian articles on Hebron published by \"This Week in Palestine\"\nSephardic Studies 1839 Sephardic census of Ottoman-controlled Hebron.\nArchNet.org. \"Hebron\".

          "summary": "Hebron (Arabic: الخليل, romanized: al-Khalīl, ) is a city in the southern West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Hebron Governorate, which is the largest in the West Bank. It is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south of Jerusalem. The population inside in the city limits is 201,063, while the adjacent metropolitan area within the governorate is home to over 700,000 people. Hebron spans across an area of 74.1 square kilometers (28.6 sq mi). It is the third largest city in the country after Gaza and East Jerusalem. The city is often considered one of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism, as well as in Christianity and Islam.\nIt is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the Levant. According to the Bible, Abraham settled in Hebron and bought the Cave of the Patriarchs as burial place for his wife Sarah. Biblical tradition holds that the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with their wives Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah, were buried in the cave. The city is also recognized in the Bible as the place where David was anointed king of Israel. Following the Babylonian captivity, the Edomites settled in Hebron. During the first century BCE, Herod the Great built the wall that still surrounds the Cave of the Patriarchs, which later became a church, and then a mosque. With the exception of a brief Crusader control, successive Muslim dynasties ruled Hebron from the 7th century CE until the Ottoman Empire's dissolution following World War I, when the city became part of British Mandatory Palestine.\nThe 1929 Hebron massacre of nearly 70 Jews and the Arab uprising of 1936–39 led the British government to evacuate the Jewish community from Hebron. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Hebron, occupied and annexed by Jordan, and since the 1967 Six-Day War, the city has been under Israeli control. Following Israeli occupation, Jewish presence was restored in the city. Since the 1997 Hebron Protocol, most of Hebron has been governed by the Palestinian National Authority. The city is often described as a \"microcosm\" of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. The 1997 protocol divided the city into two sectors—H1 Hebron, governed by the Palestinian National Authority, and H2 Hebron, occupied by Israeli authorities. All security arrangements and travel permits for local residents are coordinated between the Palestinian Authority and Israel via the COGAT. The Jewish settlers have their own governing municipal body, the Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron.\nThe largest city in the southern West Bank, Hebron is a chief commercial and industrial center in the region. It is a busy hub of trade, generating roughly a third of the area's GDP, largely due to the sale of limestone from quarries in its area. Hebron has a local reputation for its grapes, figs, ceramics, plastics, pottery workshops, metalworking and glassblowing industry. The city is home to numerous shopping malls. The Old City of Hebron features narrow, winding streets, flat-roofed stone houses, and old bazaars. It is recognized as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. Hebron is also known as a regional educational and medical hub.",

          "content": "الخَلِيل مدينه فلسطينيه، ومركز محافظه الخليل اداريًا، تقع في الضفه الغربيه الى الجنوب من القدس بحوالي 35 كم. اسسها الكَنعَانِيون في العصر البرونزي المبكر، وتُعد اليوم اكبر مدن الضفه الغربيه من حيث عدد السكان والمساحه، حيث بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2016 بقرابه 215 الف نسمه، وتبلغ مساحتها 42 كم2. تمتاز المدينه باهميه اقتصاديه، حيث تُعد من اكبر المراكز الاقتصاديه في الضفه الغربيه. وللخليل اهميه دينيه للديانات الابراهيميه الثلاث، حيث يتوسط المدينه المسجد الابراهيمي الذي يحوي مقامات للانبياء ابراهيم، واسحق، ويعقوب، وزوجاتهم.\nتُقسم مدينه الخليل حاليّاً الى البلده القديمه والحديثه، وتديرها بلديه الخليل التي اُسِّسَت عام 1927، كما انها مركز محافظه الخليل التي يضم التقسيم الاداري الحالي لها العشرات من القرى والبلدات، ويُقدر عدد سكان المحافظه باكثر من 684 الف نسمه (2014). تقع البلده القديمه بمحاذاه المسجد الابراهيمي. وهي عباره عن ازقّه وبيوت ودكاكين قديمه، وتضم العديد من الاسواق. تقوم اسرائيل باغلاق اجزاء كبيره منها وتنشر قوات من الجيش الاسرائيلي فيها لوجود تجمّع حديث لليهود الارثوذكس يسعى للسيطره على العقارات في تلك المنطقه. تسيطر اسرائيل على حوالي 20% من مساحه المدينه بحسب اتفاق اعاده الانتشار في الخليل في عام 1997، ولكن تتحمل السلطه الفلسطينيه اداره الشؤون المدنيه للفلسطينيين فيها. يحيط بالمدينه ايضًا الكثير من المستوطنات الاسرائيليه، اكبرها مستوطنه كريات اربع، والمستوطنات والتجمعات اليهوديه تحتكم لجسم بلدي منفصل. وتعد المدينه من المدن المقدسه الاربع في الديانه اليهوديه.\nفي السابع من تموز 2017، ادرجت منظمه الامم المتحده للتربيه والعلم والثقافه «اليونسكو» البلده القديمه في مدينه الخليل والمسجد الابراهيمي على قائمه التراث العالمي المُهدد بالخطر بوصفها منطقه تُعرف بقيمتها العالميه، وقد حصلت مدينه الخليل والمسجد الابراهيمي على اغلبيه اصوات الدول المشاركه في التصويت الذي جرى في مدينه كراكوف البولنديه.\n\nالتسميه\nسُميَّت مدينه الخليل بهذا الاسم نسبهً الى نبي الله ابرَاهِيم الخليل، حيث يُعتقد انه سكنها في منطقه الحرم الابراهيمي بعد هجرته من مدينه اور السومريه. كانت تسمى بقريه اربع نسبه الى ملك كنعاني اسمه اربع، وسميت بعدها حبرون لاحد سببين، اما نسبه للملك عفرون الحثي الكنعاني الذي باع المغاره لـ ابراهيم، حسب الروايه التوراتيه، باربعمائه شواقل وكان الشاقل العمله الكنعانيه، واما لكونها كلمه مشتقه من كلمه «حافير» العبريه او الخليل بالعربيه. سمّيت فيما بعد بالخليل ويبلغ عدد سكانها 320,000 نسمه.\n\nالتاريخ\nتُعتبر مدينه الخليل من المدن العربيه القليله التي حافظت على استمراريه الاستقرار البشري. والخليل هي مدينه مقدسه لليهود والمسلمين والمسيحيين. كما انها معروفه باعتبارها مدينه الاباء. يعتقد بعض الناس ان ابراهيم، اب الاديان الابراهيميه، قد عاش في الخليل عام 1800 قبل الميلاد او نحو ذلك. يعتقدون ايضا انه قد اشترى المغاره التي بني عليها المسجد الابراهيمي/ مغاره مكفيلا، حيث يعتقدون ان ابراهيم قد دفن هناك وزوجته ساره، وابنهما اسحاق وحفيدهما يعقوب. على مر التاريخ، كانت هنالك فترات لاغلبيه مسلمه، من الذين عاشوا في مدينه الخليل الى جانب اقليات من اليهود.\n\nوُجدت في الخليل اثار تشير الى وجود مدني في العصر البرونزي المبكر (في حدود النصف الثاني من الالف الثالث قبل الميلاد) وكانت المدينه في الاصل مدينه كنعانيه جليله مترفه، وسيطرت عليها - كما في بقيه فلسطين- العديد من القوى، من الاشوريين عام 732 ق.م والبابليين عام 586 ق.م والفرس عام 539 ق.م والاغريق عام 322 ق.م، وانتزعها منهم الرومان عام 63 ق.م. ثم انتقلت لقبضه البيزنطيين عام 593 م الاّ انّ الفرس احتلوها منهم لبضع سنوات، ثمّ عاد الروم البيزنطيون فاستعادوها مره اخرى، واخرجوا الفرس منها، وانتقلت لسيطره العرب المسلمين في القرن السابع الميلادي. ضمّها الصليبيون لممالكهم عام 1167م حتى هزيمتهم بعد معركه حطين سنه 1187م امام جيش صلاح الدين الايوبي ونقل اليها منبر عسقلان العاجي. لاحقا تطورت المدينه في العهدين المملوكي والعثماني، واشتهرت في عصر العثمانيين بصناعه القناديل والزجاج الملوّن، وبلغ من تقدمها انذاك ان شاركت في المعرض العالمي الذي اقيم في فينا عام 1873م، حيث عرضت صناعات الخليل من ادوات الزينه المصنوعه من الزجاج الملوّن، كما ازدهرت في فتره الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين، حيث اسست بلديه الخليل عام 1927م. وخلال حرب 1948، وقع نصف قضاء الخليل ضمن حدود اسرائيل دون المدينه، حيث فقد القضاء معظم قراه وبلداته واخصب اراضيه الواقعه غربًا، واخضعت المدينه للاداره الاردنيه عام 1950م. وفي حرب 1967 استكملت اسرائيل احتلال المحافظه بما فيها المدينه، وقامت بمصادره جزء كبير من المدينه لاسكان المستوطنين اليهود فيها، وخاصه في البلده القديمه.].\n\nالعهد الكنعاني\nتُعد الخليل من اقدم مدن العالم، وتاريخها يعود الى 5500 عام. بناها الكنعانيون واطلقوا عليها اسم (قريه اربع) نسبه الى بانيها (اربع) وهو ابو عَناق اعظم العناقيين، وكانوا يوصفون بالجبابره، ولما جاء يوشع بن نون غير اسم قريه اربع الى حيرون نسبه الى احد اولاد كالب بن يفنه، ثم سميت الخليل نسبه الى (خليل الرحمن) ابراهيم، ففي اوائل القرن التاسع عشر قبل الميلاد سكن ابراهيم بعض السنين تحت بلوطات «ممرًا» الواقعه شمال الخليل، وتضم الخليل رفاته ورفاه زوجته ساره، وعائلته من بعده اسحق ويعقوب ويوسف لوط ويونس، ثم صارت الخليل قاعده لدواوود بن سليمان سبع سنين ونصفا فقط، وكذلك تضم الكثير من رفات الصحابه وفي مقدمتهم شهداء معركه اجنادين. يواصل اليهود ادعائهم فهم يدَعُون ان موسى استخرج تابوته من اعماق النيل وحمله معه وان «يوشع بن نون» دفنه في مغاره في حبرى (الخليل) وهم بهذا الادعاء وغيره يريدون عبر الصهيونيه الى استدرار عاطفه الناس دينيًا وخلق تاريخ وهمي من العدم.\n\nبعد الميلاد\nفي ايام الرومان، اقيمت كنيسه على مقبره ابراهيم وعائلته، ولما دخل الفرس سنه 614 م هدموها، تُعد الخليل واحده من اخر المدن في فلسطين التي دخلها الفتح الاسلامي في القرن السابع الميلادي. وقد كانت تُسمى على ايام النبي محمد بـ«حبرا». وقد شاد الامويون سقف الحرم الحالي والقباب التي فوق مراقد ابراهيم ويعقوب وزوجتيهما. وفي العصر العباسي فتح الخليفه المهدي باب السور الحالي من جهه الشرق وبنوا له المراقي الجميله من ناحيتي الشمال والجنوب وامر المقتدر بالله ببناء القبه التي على ضريح يوسف.\n\nوفي العصر الفاطمي لم يكن لمشهد الخليل باب، وكان دخوله مستحيلاً، بل كان الناس يزورونه من الايوان في الخارج. فلما جلس المهدي على عرش مصر امر بفتح باب فيه، وزيّنه وفرشه بالسجاجيد، وادخل على عمارته اصلاحاً كثيراً. وباب المشهد وسط الحائط الشمالي على ارتفاع اربع اذرع فوق الارض، وعلى جانبه درجات من الحجر، فيصعد اليه من جانب ويكون النزول من الجانب الثاني. ووضع هناك باب صغير من الحديد.\nلقد وصف الاصطخري المدينه بقوله: ««ومن بيت لحم على سمته في الجنوب مدينه صغيره، شبيهه في القدر بقريه ـ تعرف بمسجد ابراهيم، وفي المسجد الذي يجمّع فيه الجمعه قبر ابراهيم واسحق ويعقوب صفاً، وقبور نسائهم صفاً بحذاء كل قبر من قبورهم قبر امراه صاحبه، والمدينه في وهده بين الجبال كثيره كثيفه الاشجار، واشجار هذه الجبال وسائر جبال فلسطين وسهلها زيتون وتين وجميز وعنب وسائر الفواكه اقل من ذلك»».\nكما وصفها المقدسي: ««حبرى هي قريه ابراهيم الخليل، فيها حصن منيع، يزعمون انه من بناء الجن من حجاره عظيمه منقوشه، وسطه قبّه من الحجاره اسلاميه، على قبر ابراهيم وقبر اسحق، قُدَّام في المغطى، وقبر يعقوب في المؤخر. حذاء كل نبي امراته. وقد جُعل الحبر مسجداً وبني حوله دور للزّوار. واختلطت فيه العماره ولهم قناه ضعيفه. وهذه القريه الى نحو نصف مرحله من كل جانب قرى وكروم واعناب وتفاح، تسمى جبل نصره لا يُرى مثله، ولا احسن من فواكهه، عامتها تحمل الى مصر وتنشر. وفي هذه القريه ضيافه دائمه وطبّاخ وخباز وخدام، مرتبون يقدمون العدس بالزيت لكل من حضر من الفقراء. ويدفع الى الاغنياء اذا اخذوا. ويظن اكثر الناس انه من قرى ابراهيم وانما هو من وقف تميم الداري وغيره. والافضل عندي التورُّع عنه»».\n\nالحروب الصليبيه\nوقد سقطت مدينه «الخليل» في ايدى الفرنجه عام 1099 م ابَّان الحروب الصليبيه. وقام الامير جودفري البويوني ببناء قلعه حصينه لحمايتها والتي سمّاها \"Castellion Saint Abraham\" - اي: «قلعه القديس ابراهام»، ثم منحها وقلعتها الى جيرارد افسنس \"Gerard of Avesenes\" طبقا للعرف الاقطاعي، الذي صار عليه الفرنجه في توزيع معظم البلاد والاراضي التي تم الاستيلاء عليها لكبار الامراء والقاده العسكريين. وهكذا تحولت مدينه الخليل وجزء من الزمام الزراعي المحيط بها الى اقطاعيه فرنجيه صليبيه، يسيطر عليها احد الامراء بفضل جهود الامير جودفري، الذي يرجع اليه الفضل بوضع اساس النظام الاقطاعي الفرنجي الصليبي في فلسطين، غير ان السمات البارزه لهذا النظام لم تظهر في عهده؛ بسبب قصر المده التي حكمها.\nاصبحت الخليل اقطاعيه فرنجيه صليبيه، لكن الملك الفرنجي في بيت المقدس لم يقم بمنح جميع اراضي الخليل للسيد الاقطاعي وانما احتفظ بجزء منها، مما يشير الى ان المملكه الفرنجيه اتبعت نهجا واضحا في سياستها العامه والمتعلقه بمنح الاقطاعات والاملاك المحدده دون اللجوء الى منح المدن المناطق الريفيه المحيطه بها للساده الاقطاعيين. وربما كان ملوك بيت المقدس يهدفون من وراء هذه السياسه تحقيق عده امور منها: الاحتفاظ بمساحات شاسعه من اراضي الخليل من اجل منح جزء منها للكنائس والاديره وصغار النبلاء والفرسان، او ربما للحد من سلطه السيد الاقطاعي، او ربما من اجل الاسهام في تغطيه نفقات التاج من عائدات هذه الاراضي.\nلقد استطاع صلاح الدين الايوبي استرداد المدينه من ايدى الصليبيين اثر موقعه حطين عام 1187 م. وفي عام (656 هـ - 1258 م) اغار المغول على مدينه الخليل بعدما دمّروا بغداد، غير ان انتصارات «قطز» في عين جالوت عام (658 هـ - 1260 م) وضعت حدًا نهائيً لتلك الغارات.\n\nالعهد المملوكي\nاستعاد القائد صلاح الدين الايوبي مدينه الخليل في 1187. تم ذلك بمساعده يهوديه وفقا لتقليد واحد في وقت متاخر، في مقابل خطاب من الامن السماح لهم بالعوده الى المدينه، وبناء كنيس هناك. تم تغيير اسم المدينه مره اخرى الى مدينه الخليل. وقد بقي ربع الكرديه موجود في البلده خلال الفتره الاولى من الحكم العثماني. استعاد ريتشارد قلب الاسد المدينه بعد فتره وجيزه. تمكن ريتشارد من كورنوال، وجلبه من انجلترا لتسويه العداوات الخطيره بين فرسان المعبد والاسبتاريه، التي تنافس للخطر معاهده ضمان الاستقرار الاقليمي المنصوص عليها مع السلطان المصري والصالح ايوب، لفرض السلام في المنطقه. لكن بعد وقت قصير من مغادرته، ونتيجه للحروب المتناحره من عام 1241، وفرسان المعبد الذين شنوا غاره مدمره، في انتهاك للاتفاقيات.\nفي 1260، بعد غارات المغول على فلسطين، لامست واحده منها الخليل. وقد تم بناء ماذن على هيكل مغاره المكفيله/المسجد الابراهيمي في ذلك الوقت. بعد ست سنوات، خلال الحج الى مدينه الخليل، اصدر بيبرس مرسوما يمنع المسيحيين ويهود\nمن دخول الحرم، واصبح المناخ اقل تسامحا مع اليهود والمسيحيين مما كانت عليه تحت حكم الدوله الايوبيه قبل. لم يكن مرسوم لاستبعاد المسيحيين واليهود بصرامه حتى منتصف القرن الرابع عشر وبحلول 1490 سمح لمن هم ليسو بمسلمين بالدخول في كهوف تحت الارض. تم بناء مصنع في ارطاس عام 1307 حيث تم تخصيص الارباح من دخلها الى مستشفى في الخليل. ولقد كتب العديد من الزوار حول الخليل على مدى القرنين التاليين (من بينها \"Ishtori HaParchi\" عام 1322 و \"Nachmanides\" عام 1270 والحاخام ميشولام من فولتيرا عام 1481 و \"HaParchi\" عام 1322. ولم يُسجل اي ذكر لليهود في مدينه الخليل في هذه الفتره.\nلقد استمرت الهجره الى المدينه من قبل المجموعات العرقيه والدينيه المختلفه، ومن ضمنها مجموعات يهوديه صغيره وفقيره اعتاشت على صدقات المحسنين اليهود الذين كانوا يزورون المدينه (خلال الفتره المملوكيه)، وسكنت في قلب المدينه في حاره الداريه. هذا بالاضافه الى نشوء حاره صغيره للنصارى (استمرت بالوجود حتى مطلع الفتره العثمانيه)، لتختفي بعدها. ولكن تعود كل الحارات القديمه، والتي ما زالت قائمه، في شكلها النهائي الى الفتره المملوكيه. وبالتالي من الممكن الاعتقاد بان شكل الخليل القديمه، كما هي عليه الان، قد تشكل في هذه الفتره، في حين كان نصيب الفتره العثمانيه، مجرد تعبئه الفراغات التي تركتها الفتره المملوكيه وتكثيف استعمال المساحات وزياده طوابق المباني القديمه وتوسع ضئيل في مساحه الحارات.\n\nالعهد العثماني\nفتح العثمانيون الشام ومدينه الخليل بعد معركه مرج دابق عام 1517 م، واستمر حكمهم 4 قرون، حتى جاء الاحتلال البريطانى لفلسطين عام 1917م الى عام 1948 م.\nلقد كانت الخليل مشهوره بعمل الزجاج. وكانت ابنيتها في هذه الفتره من الحجر الكلسي الذي يستخرج من الجبال المحيطه بها. ولهذه المدينه عده ابواب تغلق ليلاً منعاً للمواصله مع بقيه المقاطعات ومحافظه على الامن والسكينه. والمدينه الحاضره مبنيه على منحدرات الهضاب وفي السهل. وموقع الحرم او الجامع يقع عند نهايه المنحدر البعيد عنها قليلاً. وضمت الخليل 22 الف نسمه في نهايه الفتره العثمانيه. بينهم 2000 يهودي لهم ثلاثه معابد. تقوم على مساحه ضيقه من واد ينحدر من الشمال الغربي. ضواحي البلده خصبه، تكثر فيها عيون الماء. يصنع اليهود الخمر الجيد من العنب الذي يكثر في الجوار. وفضلاً عن الكرمه فان اشجار اللوز والمشمش في نمو وازدهار. والخليل ايضاً سوق تجاري.\n\nبالنسبه لاحياء المدينه في هذه الفتره، فضلاً عن الاحياء اليهوديه الواقعه في شمالها الغربي وجنوبها الغربي كانت تضم سبعه احياء:\n\nحي الشيخ علي البكا ويعلو هذا الحي على مجرى مياه «عين قشقله» وترى بقربها مغائر وقبور صخريه. ومن هذه العين ممر يؤدي الى راس تله (حبال الرياح).\nحاره باب الزاويه.\nحاره القزازين ـ نسبه الى عمّال الزجاج.\nحاره العقّابه حيث يقيم عمّال المعاطف الشتويه المصنوعه من الجلد\nحاره الحرم\nحاره المشارقه\nحاره قيطون ـ حيث كان يقيم عمال القطن\nكانت البلده القديمه تقوم في القرب من المدينه الحاليه، على «تله الرميده» المغطاه باشجار الزيتون وترى على هذه التله بقايا جدران ضخمه وبنايه حديثه تحمل اسم دير الاربعين. وفي الجنوب الغربي من حاره الحرم انشئت بركتان كبيرتان: الاولى تحمل اسم «بركه القزازين» طولها 28 يارده وعرضها 18 يارده وعمقها 27 قدماً ونصف القدم. والثانيه وتقع في اسفل الوادي وتعرف باسم «بركه السلطان» بنيت باحجار مصقوله، مربعه الشكل طول كل ضلع من اضلاعها نحو 44 يارده. وبقربها تقوم «السراي» الجديده. وكان لا يسمح لغير المسلمين دخول الحرم الشريف. ولم يدخله من غير المسلمين الاّ اقليه ممتازه من الاوروبيين انما كان يسمح لليهود وغيرهم الصعود الى الدرجه السابعه فقط من سلّم الحرم. وعند الدرجه الخامسه يوجد ثقب يعتقد اليهود انه يمتد الى داخل الحرم الى ان تصل بالقبور. وفي كل جمعه ياتون الى الدرجه المذكوره يبكون وينوحون شانهم في شان نحيبهم عند حائط البراق (المبكى) في بيت المقدس. وفي الجنوب من تله «قب الجانب» تقع محطه الكرنتينا. وتلاصق الحرم من الجنوب «القلعه» وهي نصف خربه تستعمل ثكنه للجنود.وفي الخليل ايضاً اداره للبريد والبرق وفرع لبنك انجلو فلسطين ومستشفى للارساليه الاسكوتلنديه.\n\nعهد الانتداب البريطاني\nبعد الحرب العالميه الاولى، انتقلت مدينه الخليل لتكون تحت الانتداب البريطاني. خلال سنوات العشرينات، نتيجه لازدياد الصهيونيه من جهه، وتنميه الوعي القومي العربي من جهه اخرى، زادت حده التوتر بين العرب واليهود الذين عاشوا تحت الانتداب. وقد ادعت كلتا الايديولوجيتين ادعاءات سياسيه واقليميه متضاربه حول نفس المنطقه، مما اسفر عن انفجار في الخليل، في مذبحه عام 1929.\n\nالحكم الاردني\nقامت هيئه الامم المتحده عام 1947 بمحاوله لايجاد حل للنزاع العربي/اليهودي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئه الامم بتشكيل لجنه \"UNSCOP\" المتالّفه من دول متعدّده باستثناء الدّول دائمه العضويه لضمان الحياد في عمليه ايجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنه بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الاول باقامه دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينه القدس من قِبل اداره دوليه. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تاسيس فيدراليه تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهوديه والعربيه. ومال معظم افراد لجنه \"UNSCOP\" تجاه المشروع الاول والرامي لتاسيس دولتين مستقلّتين باطار اقتصادي موحد. وقامت هيئه الامم بقبول مشروع لجنه \"UNSCOP\" الدّاعي للتقسيم مع اجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركه بين الدولتين، العربيه وواليهوديه، على ان يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nاعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من ارض فلسطين للدوله اليهوديه، وشملت حصّه اليهود من ارض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من اسدود الى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينه يافا) واغلبيه مساحه صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينه بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصريه). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحه للزراعه ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الارض الفلسطينيه على اماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهوديه بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدوله اليهوديه.\nلقد افضت احداث حرب 1948 الى اعلان الاداره الاردنيه للضفه الغربيه، حيث ضم الاردن الضفه الغربيه، بما فيها مدينه الخليل، بصفه رسميه يوم 24 نيسان/ ابريل 1950، لكن الجامعه العربيه واخرون اعلنوا بطلان وعدم قانونيه الضم ولم يعترف به سوى ثلاث دول هي العراق وباكستان وبريطانيا.\nاستمر هذا الوضع حتى حرب 1967، بعد سقوط الضفه الغربيه بيد اسرائيل. الا ان الوضع القانوني للمدينه ومعها الضفه الغربيه باكملها قد ظل بكونها جزءًا من حدود المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه حتى قرار فك الارتباط عام 1988، حيث تم اعلان الاستقلال الفلسطيني. وقد تخلى الاردن بموجبه عن المطالبه بالضفه الغربيه لمنظمه التحرير الفلسطينيه، التي كانت قد عُينت سابقًا من قبل الجامعه العربيه ك«ممثل شرعي وحيد للشعب الفلسطيني».\n\nالنكسه\nرزحت الخليل تحت الاحتلال الاسرائيلي واصبحت مركزاً لمنطقه الخليل التي يحكمها حاكم عسكري اسرائيلي مباشره، حيث احتلت اسرائيل مدينه الخليل في 5 يونيو 1967، ومنذ ذلك التاريخ شرع المستوطنون اليهود بالاستيطان في محيط المدينه ثم في داخلها، ويوجد داخل المدينه حاليا خمسه مواقع استيطانيه يهوديه وهي مستوطنه تل الرميده، والدبويا، ومدرسه اسامه بن المنقذ وسوق الخضار والاستراحه السياحيه قرب المسجد الابراهيمي الشريف، بالاضافه الى التجمع الاستيطاني اليهودي على حدود المدينه الشرقيه (كريات اربع وخارسينا).\nالخليل هي المدينه الفلسطينيه الوحيده التي اقيمت في قلبها مستوطنه. لاجل حريه حركه للمئات القلائل من المستوطنين اختارت اسرائيل سياسه رسميه مميزه ضد السكان الفلسطينيين في المدينه. مع مرور السنين اصبح مركز المدينه كمدينه اشباح.\n\nعلى مدار سنوات، تم اقامه عدد من نقاط الاستيطان الاسرائيليه في مدينه الخليل القديمه وضواحيها، وهي منطقه كانت بمثابه مركز تجاري لجنوب الضفه الغربيه. وتقوم الجهات المسئوله عن القانون في اسرائيل وقوات الامن الاسرائيليه بتكبيد ثمن حمايه هذه النقاط الاستيطانيه من جميع السكان الفلسطينيين. ولهذا الغرض، تنتهج اسرائيل نظامًا يستند بصوره صريحه ومكشوفه الى «مبدا الفصل»، الذي على ضوئه اوجدت اسرائيل عزلا (SEGREGATION) على الارض وعزلاً قانونيًا ما بين المستوطنين الاسرائيليين وبين الغالبيه الفلسطينيه.\nوقد ادت هذه السياسه الى انهيار الاقتصاد وسط مدينه الخليل ونزوح واسع للسكان الفلسطينيين. وتُظهر نتائج المسح الذي اُجري من اجل اعداد هذا التقرير، ان الفلسطينيين نزحوا عن ما لا يقل عن 1014 شقه سكنيه في وسط مدينه الخليل، علمًا ان هذه الشقق تُشكل 41.9% من مجموع الشقق السكنيه في هذه المنطقه. كما ان 65% من الشقق التي تم اخلاؤها، وعددها 659، نزح عنها سكانها خلال الانتفاضه الثانيه. كما يتضح من نتائج المسح ان 1829 محلاً تجاريًا فلسطينيًا في المنطقه التي جرى مسحها اصبحت مهجوره اليوم، علما ان هذه المحلات التجاريه المغلقه تشكل 76.6% من مجموع المحال التجاريه في هذه المنطقه. 62.4% من المحال التجاريه المغلقه، وعددها 1141 محلا، تم اغلاقها خلال الانتفاضه الثانيه، وان 440 محلًا منها جرى اغلاقها باوامر عسكريه.\nان المكونات الاساسيه لـ«سياسه الفصل» الاسرائيليه تقوم على الحظر الشديد والواسع لحركه الفلسطينيين والامتناع المنهجي عن فرض القانون والنظام على المستوطنين العنيفين الذين يعتدون على الفلسطينيين. كل هذا الى جانب ما يلحق سكان المدينه الفلسطينيين من اذى مباشر من قبل القوات الاسرائيليه.\n\nالسلطه الفلسطينيه\nاستمر هذا الوضع حتى قدوم السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه عام 1995، واصبحت المدينه منذ ذلك الحين، مركزاً لمحافظه الخليل، كما وقعت معظم اراضي المحافظه ضمن تصنيف (ا) و (ب) حسب اتفاق اوسلو. في عام 1994، عندما كان سير عمليه اتفاق اوسلو في اوجه، قام المستوطن اليهودي باروخ غولدشتاين باطلاق النار على المسلمين الذين كانوا يصلون في الحرم الابراهيمي وقتل 29 منهم واصاب عددًا اكبر بكثير.\nاستمر سير عمليه اتفاق اوسلو وفي شباط/فبراير 1997، تم توقيع اتفاق حول الانتشار الجزئي للجيش الاسرائيلي في الخليل، وتم تقسيم المدينه الى قسمين: منطقه H1، والتي تم تسليم السيطره عليها للسلطه الفلسطينيه، ومنطقه H2 - التي بقيت تحت سيطره الجيش الاسرائيلي. وفي ابريل/ نيسان 2002، سيطر جيش الاحتلال الاسرائيلي على المدينه باكملها، ووضعت ابراج مراقبه ثابته في منطقه H1 في المدينه في عام 2003.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع المدينه على هضبه ترتفع 940 م عن سطح البحر. يربطها طريق رئيسي بمدينتي بيت لحم والقدس، وتقع على الطريق الذي يمر باواسط فلسطين رابطه الشام بمصر مروراً بسيناء.\nوقد بنيت الخليل على سفحي جبلي جبل الرميده وجبل الراس على ارتفاع 927 م، وفي الوادي بين الجبلين الذي يختلف اسمه على طول مجراه، حيث يعرف بوادي التفاح، وهو يخترق وسط الخليل.\nوتقع الخليل على بُعد 35 كم للجنوب من مدينه القدس، و46 كم غرب نهر الاردن، و152 كم جنوب مدينه جنين، و229 كم غرب مدينه الكرك الاردنيه.\n\nمناطق المدينه\nتُقسم المدينه الى البلده القديمه والجديده، من اهم الاحياء الجديده في المدينه:\n\nاما البلده القديمه فتتميز بعراقتها واصالتها، ويعود تاريخ مبانيها الى العهد الايوبي والمملوكي والعثماني، وتمتاز البلده القديمه بنظامها المعماري الرائع وفيها العديد من المباني الاثريه والتاريخيه والقناطر والازقه والاسواق القديمه. ومن اهم الاحياء القديمه في المدينه: حي الشيخ علي البكاء، حي القزازين، حي السواكنه، حي القلعه، حي بني دار، حاره العقابه، حي المحتسبيين، حي المدرسه، حي قيطون، حي المشارقه حي الاكراد، حي المشارقه الفوقا، وحي الحوشيه.\n\nالمناخ\nيسود في الخليل مناخ متوسطي معتدل، ذو صيف حار وجاف، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يحل فصل الربيع في اواخر شهر مارس (اذار) واوائل ابريل (نيسان)، ويعتبر شهرا يوليو (تموز) واغسطس (اب) احرّ شهور السنه، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحراره فيهما الى 28.9 ° مئويه (84 ° فهرنهايت)، اما اكثر الاشهر بروده فهو يناير (كانون الثاني)، ويصل فيه معدل درجه الحراره الى 3.9 ° مئويه (39 ° فهرنهايت).\nاما بالنسبه لمعدلات الامطار فتكون معدومه في بعض الاشهر مثل يونيو ويوليو واغسطس. بينما يتساقط بين شهريّ اكتوبر (تشرين الاول) وابريل (نيسان) عادهً، ويبلغ معدل المتساقطات السنوي 589 مليمتراً (23.2 انش)، وتكون في اعلى معدلاتها في شهري يناير وفبراير حيث يمكن ان يصل مستواها الى اكثر من 170 ميليمتراً.\n\nالسكان\nالخليل اكبر مدن الضفه الغربيه، حيث يبلغ عدد سكانها اليوم 200,000 نسمه (بحسب بلديه الخليل). ويذكر بان عدد سكان الخليل مع مطلع القرن العشرين كان قد قدر بحوالي 8000 – 10000 نسمه فقط.\nوقد بلغ عدد سكانها عام 1922 م حوالي 16,577 نسمه منهم 430 يهودياً وعام 1945 م حوالي 24,560 نسمه وبلغ عدد سكانها عام 1967 م بعد الاحتلال حوالي 38,300 نسمه ارتفع الى 79,100 نسمه عام 1987 م.\nاقامت سلطات الاحتلال احزمه استيطانيه حول المدينه وانشات اول مستوطنه هي (كريات اربع) تمهيداً لتطويق المدينه ومحاصرتها جغرافياً وسكانياً ومن اجل هذا الهدف صادرت مساحات واسعه من اراضيها واقامت مستوطنتين عام 1981م هما مستوطنه (كرمل) وهي من نوع موشاف مساحتها 4 الاف دونم ومستوطنه (ماعون) واقامت سلطات الاحتلال حيا يهوديا في قلب المدينه، وبلغت مساحه الاراضي المصادره من المدينه وما حولها حوالي 72700 دونم حتى عام 1981م وتبلغ عدد المستوطنات المقامه في المحافظه 34 مستوطنه حتى نهايه 1987م ومنها 26 مستوطنه تزيد مساحه الواحده منها عن 25 دونم.\nالجدول الاتي يبين عدد سكان منطقه الخليل في فترات مختلفه:\n\nواما الاصول العرقيه لسكان المدينه، فبالرغم من وقوع الكثير من القصص العائليه تحت الاساطير التاريخيه، الا ان هناك جزء ليس بقليل من السكان، الذين نعرف اصولهم على وجه اليقين، منها الاصول العربيه قبل الاسلاميه (قبيله لخم اجداد التميميه)، واصول كرديه (الاكراد)، واصول عربيه سوريه (الجعابره من قلعه جعبر على الضفاف السوريه من نهر الفرات على بعد 35 من مدينه الرقه)، واصول مغربيه، وتركيه، كما هاجر الى الخليل عائلات من مدن فلسطينيه مختلفه (القدس وعسقلان، او من جبل الخليل مثل دورا ويطا على سبيل المثال). وانضم الى السكان بعد النكبه عام 1948 عددا غير معروف من اللاجئين، الذين سكنوا داخل المدينه واختلطوا باهلها.\n\nالاقتصاد\nالزراعه\nعلى الصعيد الزراعي عرفت الخليل منذ القدم بانها مدينه تحيط بها الاراضي الزراعيه من كل جانب واشتهرت في زراعه العنب والتين واللوز والمشمش والزيتون وتزرع الحبوب، والزراعه هي من اهم الحرف التي يمارسها السكان في محافظه الخليل، وهي تمثل موردًا اقتصاديًا هامًا، وقد بلغت المساحه المزروعه 338,400 دونم عام 2006-2007 ومن اهم المحاصيل الزراعيه في الخليل الحبوب والخضار، والاشجار المثمره مثل الزيتون واللوز والعنب والفواكه الاخرى، وتضم الخليل عددًا كبيرًا من الثروه الحيوانيه، اذ تشكل 30.2% من جمله هذه الثروه في الضفه الغربيه، ومن اهم انواع الحيوانات الماعز والضان.\n\nالصناعه\nمارس سكان الخليل الصناعه منذ القدم، حيث انتشرت الصناعه اليدويه، بل ان بعض حارات الخليل سميت باسماء هذه الحرف، مثل سوق الحصريه وسوق الغزل وحاره الزجاجيين، ولمحافظه الخليل شهره في صناعه الصابون ودباغه الجلود وصناعه الاكياس الكبيره من شعر الحيوان ومعاطف الفرو والفخار والاحذيه والنسيج والصناعات الخشبيه والخزف والنسيج والهدايا، وحتى عام 1978 ضمت محافظه الخليل اكثر من ثلث الوحدات الصناعيه في الضفه الغربيه وهي: الصناعات الغذائيه، النسيج والملابس، الجلود ومنتجاتها ماعدا الاحذيه، الاحذيه ما عدا المطاطيه الاخشاب ما عدا الاثاث، الورق ومنتجاته، النشر والطباعه، الزجاج، صناعات غير معدنيه، صناعات غير حديديه، تصنيع المواد المعدنيه ومشتقاتها، صناعه الادوات الكهربائيه.\nوتشتهر المدينه ايضًا بكثير من الصناعات المحليه التي تصدر ايضا الى الخارح بكميات كبيره وخصوصا الى الاسواق الاوروبيه، ومن اهم الصناعات في الخليل:\n\nصناعه الزجاج - وتعود الى تاريخ المدينه القديم وقد تم نطويرها لتواكب التطور الحاضر.\nصناعه الخزف والفخار - وهي ايضا من تاريخ المدينه القديم.\nصناعه الجلود - تستخدم في صناعه الاحذيه بشكل كبير حيث يتم تصدير الاحذيه الى عده دول اهمها: ايطاليا واسبانيا والاردن ودول الخليج. حيث تعتبر هذه الصناعه من اهم مصادر دخل المدينه.\nصناعه الملابس بكل انواعها - تجدر الاشاره الى ان اكبر ثوب في العالم حيك يدويا موجود في مدينه الخليل (وسجل في موسوعه غينيس).\nصناعه الباطون.\nمناشير الحجر والرخام والبلاط - وهي ايضا من اهم مصادر الدخل الاقتصادي للمدينه، حيث تصدر الى معظم الدول الاوربيه والعربيه.\nصناعنه الحديد والالمنيوم.\nصناعه الدراجات الهوائيه.\nصناعه النايلون\nصناعه الموازين والقبانات القديمه والحديثه.\nصناعه الالبان والمنتجات الغذائيه\nصناعه الاثاث المنزلي والسجاد والعطور.\n\nالتجاره\nتشتهر مدينه الخليل بالتجاره حيث يعتبر اهلها من امهر التجار في فلسطين، وتنتشر الاسواق في الخليل بكثره، حتى انها تعتبر كل المدينه سوق. ولقد حظيت محافظه الخليل بمركز تجاري، اذ ياتي اليها الفلاحون والبدو من المناطق المحيطه بها على الرغم من انها فقدت نصف قضائها عام 1948، وزادت قوه هذا المركز بعد ارتفاع مستوى المعيشه وتطور وسائل النقل فاتسعت الاسواق المركزيه وشملت معظم مساحه المدينه القديمه وبنيت اسواق متخصصه جديده.\nولقد اغلق جنود الاحتلال الاسرائيلي مؤخرا عدد كبير من المحلات التجاريه في الخليل. وتاتي عمليه الاغلاق في اطار السياسه التي تتبعها السلطات الاسرائيليه بكل ما يتعلق بوسط الخليل، والقائمه على نظام فصل يهدف الى حمايه البؤر الاستيطانيه المتعدده التي اقيمت في هذه المنطقه. هذا النظام يتجسد من خلال الفصل الميداني والقانوني بين المستوطنين الاسرائيليين وبين الغالبيه الفلسطينيه، المنع الواسع والقيود المفروضه على حركه وتنقل الفلسطينيين والامتناع المنهجي عن تطبيق القانون والنظام على المستوطنين العنيفين الذين يعتدون على الفلسطينيين. وينضاف الى هذا كله استهداف سكان المدينه الفلسطينيين بايدي عناصر قوات الامن. وقد ادت هذه السياسه الى حدوث انهيار اقتصادي وسط الخليل ورحيل السكان الفلسطينيين بصوره واسعه.\n\nالعماره والتخطيط الحضري\nالتخطيط\nما كان شارع رئيسي في المركز التجاري لمدينه الخليل، مغلق للفلسطينيين منذ عام 2000. اغلق الجيش الاسرائيلي جميع الدكاكين وابواب المنازل. يستعمل الشارع فقط لعبور المستوطنين. في تاريخ 25.12.06 اصدر المستشار القضائي للجيش الاسرائيلي في الضفه الغربيه قرار انه: تم اغلاق الشارع بالخطا وانه لا يوجد لذلك مبرر قانوني ويجب عدم منع حركه الفلسطينيين في الشارع. رغم قرار المستشار القضائي بان اغلاق الشارع غير قانوني الا ان الجيش الاسرائيلي ما زال يمنع الفلسطينيين من العبور في شارع الشهداء.\nومن الشوارع المهمه شـارع عين ساره حيث يقع فيه مبنى البلديه؛ واهم ملعب كره قدم في المدينه ملعب الحسين والعديد من المدارس والمباني الحكوميه. كما تقع فيه ايضًا مغاره عيـن ساره وهي مغاره صغيره وفيها نبع ماء، حيث يعتقد بان سكان المدينه كانوا يستعملوها للاستحمام فيها، بمن فيهم ساره زوجه ابراهيم، لهذا نسب الاسم لها.\nومن اهم الشوارع الاخرى: باب الزاويه (مركز المدينه)، راس الجوره (مدخل المدينه)، عين خير الدين، الجوزات، حاره الشيخ، حاره ابو سنينه، خله ابو مجنونه، حبايل الرياح، شارع السلام، جبل نمره، واد الهريه، حاره القزازين، الشلاله، المحاور، جبل جوهر، الكرنتينه، قيزون، الشعابه، فرش الهوى، قرن الثور، واد التفاح القديم (شارع رئيسي)، واد التفاح الجديد (شارع رئيسي)، بئر الحمص، ضاحيه الرامه، خله حاضور، خله بطرخ، شارع المدارس، شارع العدل (شارع رئيسي)، الحرس، الفحص (المنطقه الصناعيه)، ضاحيه الزيتون، ضاحيه اسكان البلديه، سوق اللبن، عيصى، سنجر، واد الجوز، ننقر، جبل الشريف، جبل سنداس، وادي ابو اكتيله، تل الرميده (منطقه اثريه)، حي الجامعه (جامعه الخليل)، شارع عثمان بن عفان (شارع رئيسي يربط جنوب الخليل بشمالها ويمتد حتى يصل احياء قيزون، حي الرامه وصولا الى راس الجوره (وهو مغلق حاليا امام حركه السكان الفلسطينيين ويستخدمه المستوطنون للوصول من مستوطنه كريات اربع الى الحرم الابراهيمي)، شارع واد النصارى او شارع بيار المحاور وهو شارع يربط شارع الكساره من الشرق بشارع عثمان بن عفان من الغرب وهو مغلق حاليا امام حركه السيارات الفلسطينيه ويستخدمه مستوطنو كريات اربع للوصول الى الحرم الابراهيمي مشيًا على الاقدام في ايام السبت)، حي واد الحصين، حي واد النصارى، حي الراس.\n\nالهويه المعماريه\nوتعتبر الخليل من المدن التي حافظت على استمراريه الاستقرار البشري على مر العصور بالرغم من عمليات التدمير والتهجير لقدسيتها المميزه وموقعها الاستراتيجي بالاشاره الى منطقه تل الرميده ونمره والبلده القديمه. للمباني العامه كالمدرسه القيمريه والفخريه والسلطان حسن والحمامات كحمام ابراهيم الخليل وحمام داري وحمام البركه وحمام كاتبه بدر وحمام الشيخ بدير وقنوات المياه والبرك والاسبله كسبيل الطواشي وصحن الحرم وسيف الدين سلار وسبيل وقناه العين الحمراء والرباطات والتكيه والزوايا ومسجد ابن عثمان ومسجد القزازين.\nتشكيل المباني السكنيه للاحواش الصغيره والكبيره واتصالها معا والمباني السكنيه كمسكن ال سلهب ومجمع الحرباوي ومسكن ال شاهين ومسكن قصر الدويك ومسكن ال الامام ومواد البناء من حجاره وفخار وجير ورماد ومخلوط الرماد والشيد -القصرمل- والاخشاب وبقايا الزيوت -الزيبار- وطرق انشاء المباني من اساسات وجدران واسقف، والحرف التقليديه في مدينه الخليل من صناعه الزجاج والفخار والخزف ودباغه الجلود وتبييض النحاس وحرفه النجاره والحداده والغزل والنسيج ومعاصر زيت الزيتون والسمسم والحفظ بالتجفيف والتمليح والسكر وصناعه طحن الحبوب.\nلقد جاءت فكره تاسيس لجنه اعمار الخليل القديمه عام 1996 لمعالجه مشاكل الاسكان والمساكن والمشاكل الاجتماعيه وبناء علاقات محليه ودوليه وتوثيق الموروث الثقافي والاشراف والترميم وعمل مخططات الحفاظ على البلده القديمه واشغال المباني والخدمات الاجتماعيه والمتابعات القانونيه والصدامات المتكرره مع الجيش والمستوطنين والاوامر العسكريه التي تمنع الترميم.\n\nيشار بالذكر الى ان هناك مذكره اعدتها بلديه الخليل من اجل ترشيح البلده القديمه على لائحه التراث العالمي لليونسكو، حمايهً للمعالم الاثريه التي قامت اسرائيل بتغيير بعضها، او بضم البعض الاخر الى قائمه التراث اليهودي الخاص بها.\n\nمعالم المدينه\nتضم الخليل مجموعه من المعالم الدينيه والتاريخيه والسياحيه التي تشجع السياح على زياره المدينه، وخاصه البلده القديمه، حيث توجد بها مجموعه من المعالم السياحيه والابنيه التاريخيه المهمه مثل المسجد الابراهيمي، الى جانب وجود مجموعه من المتاحف اهمها: متحف الخليل، وتوجد فيها مجموعه من المنتزهات والحدائق العامه اهمها: منتزه الكرمل.\nومن خلال دراسه الاكتشافات الاثريه في منطقه الخليل وقضائها، من حيث خصائصها ومميزاتها ومواصفاتها والماده الخام المستخدمه وطبيعه الرسومات، تبين ان الكنعانيين هم اول من استوطن المنطقه اقاموا فيها الكثير من مدنهم وقراهم، وبنوا الخليل القديمه، وقد بقى من هذه المدينه القديمه بعض الاثار التي تدل على مكانها. كما تحوي اثارا رومانيه وبيزنطيه وامويه وصليبيه ومملوكيه وعثمانيه.\nومن خلال البحث بمورفولوجيا البلده القديمه بالخليل من حيث هيئه العمران وتخطيط المدينه وحاراتها، يمكن تقسيمها الى الحارات التاليه: حاره القزازين وحاره السواكنه وحاره بني دار وحاره العقابه وحاره القلعه وحاره الحوشيه وحاره المحتسبيه وحاره مدرسه المعارف وحاره الاكراد وحاره اليهود وحاره المشارقه بالاضافه الى الحارات المنفصله عن البلده القديمه كحاره قيطون وحاره الشيخ علي بكا. اما الاسواق، فهناك: سوق البازار وسوق الخواجات وسوق الخضار وسوق السكافيه وسوق اللبن وسوق المغاربه وسوق القزازين.\nبعد احتلال المدينه من قبل اسرائيل في عام 1967 م شرع المستوطنون اليهود بالاستيطان في محيط المدينه ثم في داخلها حيث يوجد حاليِا خمس مواقع استيطانيه يهوديه، مما اثر على وضع المدينه السياحي بشكل سلبي الى حد كبير.\n\nالتعليم\nتحتل محافظه الخليل مرتبه متقدمه في نسب التعليم بالاراضي الفلسطينيه، حيث ان المعدل العام للاميه في الاراضي الفلسطينيه هو 5,8% (وهو كما معروف من اقل النسب عربياً).\nويواجه التعليم في الخليل مجموعه من التحديات، اضافه الى ان مؤسساتها التربويه تتميز بخاصيه ايضا تختلف عن باقي المؤسسات التربويه في المناطق المجاوره.\nوقد تم مؤخرًا افتتاح مشروع تحسين جوده برامج التعليم في العلوم الاجتماعيه للمرحله الاساسيه العليا للصفوف الخامس - العاشر.\n\nالتعليم المدرسي\nويوجد في المدينه العديد من المدارس لمختلف المراحل الدراسيه؛ حكوميه، اهليه، ووكاله. وفيها عدد من المعاهد وكليات المجتمع وفيها جامعه بولتكنيك فلسطين ومعهد العروب وفيها جامعه الخليل تاسست عام 1971. وقد بلغ عدد الابنيه المدرسيه في مديريه التربيه والتعليم في الخليل في عام 2011 ما يزيد عن 132 مدرسه ينتظم فيها 66 الف طالبًا وطالبه موزعين في مدارس وسط المدينه وفي المنطقه الجنوبيه، وكذلك في قرى تفوح وبيت كاحل وترقوميا، كما ان هنالك 36 مدرسه تقع في منطقه H2 والتي تخضع للسيطره الاسرائيليه الكامله وهي الاكثر تضرراً فيما يخص الابنيه المدرسيه بسبب منع الاحتلال مديريه تربيه الخليل بناء الطوابق والمدارس في تلك المنطقه، وتواجه مديريه تربيه الخليل ازدياد سنوي كبير في اعداد الطلبه الملتحقين بنظام التعليم الحكومي، مما يؤدي الى اكتظاظ في الصفوف الدراسيه.\n\nالتعليم العالي\nجامعه الخليل.\nجامعه بولتكنيك فلسطين.\nكليه العروب التقنيه (العروب).\nجامعه القدس المفتوحه.\n\nالثقافه\nشكلت الثقافه جزءًا من هويه سكان منطقه الخليل منذ زمن بعيد، والتي كانت في الاغلب ثقافه تعبر عن الاقتصاد الفلسطيني، ويظهر الاختلاف بشكل واضح في اللكنه او للهجه التي تميز سكان هذه المنطقه عن باقي اللهجات الفلسطينيه بقلب القاف الى الف، كما تمتاز اللهجه الخليليه بطول النغمه الموسيقيه والكلمات بها. اما بالنسبه للزي التقليدي، فيتميز في منطقه الخليل وجنوب الضفه الغربيه عن غيره من الازياء الفلسطينيه الاخرى ببساطته ولونه الاحمر والابيض المقلم. كما توجد في الخليل مجموعات شبابيه متعدده تهتم بالادب والثقافه الفلسطينيه والعربيه، ومن اهمها الندوه الثقافيه في الخليل.\n\nالاكلات الشعبيه\nتشتهر مدينه الخليل بكروم العنب، والتي بدورها دخلت في كثير من طعامهم، فيصنعون منه الدبس والعنطبيخ (مربى العنب) (عنب طبيخ، ويسمونه في القضاء عنبيه) والخبيصه والملبن المشهور والراووق (الراووء) والبوء سما والزبيب ومخلل الحصرم.\nكما تشتهر بمنتجات الالبان وخاصه اللبن المخيض واللبن الجميد ذائع الصيت من قرى الخليل والذي يعتبر بحق من افضل انواع الجميد ولذلك اشتهرت الخليل باكله اللبن المعقود والمنسف الفلسطيني الاصل، وكذلك الجبنه البيضاء المغليه التي تؤكل مع العنب او البطيخ او الخيار او مقليه محمره او تنقع في الماء لازاله ملوحتها واستعمالها في الحلويات كالكنافه والقطايف.\nومن اهم الاكلات التي تشتهر بها مدينه الخليل (القدره الخليليه)، وهي عباره عن الارز مع قطع لحم الخروف البلدي او الدجاج والسمنه البلديه تطبخ في قدر نحاسي مع بعضها البعض في الفرن الشعبي، بالاضافه الى المنسف والمقلوبه والمجدره.\n\nالرياضه\nيلعب في الخليل عده انديه رياضيه سواء في كره القدم او كره السله او رياضات اخرى كالفروسيه، منها: الخليل الرياضي، اهلي الخليل، خليل الرحمن، وشباب الخليل - الذي يُعد اقدمها واقدم الانديه الفلسطينيه على الاطلاق (تاسس عام 1943م). شارك بعض هذه الانديه في بطولات كره القدم في الضفه الغربيه (الدوري الاردني) قبل عام 1967، وتشارك اليوم في بطوله كاس فلسطين.\nوتحوي الخليل ملعبًا يتسع لحوالي 15 الف متفرج، وهو ملعب الحسين بن علي، تم اعاده تدشينه في عام 2009م بعد افتتاحه لاول مره في اربعينيات القرن الفائت. كما تحوي فيها اكبر صاله رياضيه في فلسطين، تم افتتاحها سنه 2011م من خلال مباراه بكره السله جمعت بين فريق فلسطيني وفريق اسباني.\n\nالصحه\nعلى الصعيد الصحي في المدينه 3 مستشفيات وهي مستشفى الاميره عاليه ويحتوي على 100 سرير، ومستشفى خليل الرحمن والمستشفى الاهلي التابع لجمعيه

          "content": "Bethlehem is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, located about ten kilometres (six miles) south of Jerusalem, and the capital of the Bethlehem Governorate. It had a population of 28,591 people, as of 2017. The city's economy is strongly linked to tourism, especially during the Christmas period, when Christians embark on a pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, which is revered as the location of the birth of Jesus.\nA possible first mention of Bethlehem is in the Amarna correspondence of ancient Egypt, dated to 1350–1330 BCE, although that reading is uncertain. In the Hebrew Bible, the period of the Israelites is described; it identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of David. In the New Testament, the city is identified as the birthplace of Jesus of Nazareth. Under the Roman Empire, the city of Bethlehem was destroyed by Hadrian, but later rebuilt by Constantine the Great, who commissioned the Church of the Nativity in 327 CE. In 529, the Church of the Nativity was heavily damaged by Samaritans involved in the Samaritan revolts; following the victory of the Byzantine Empire, it was rebuilt by Justinian I.\nLater, during the rule of several Caliphates, Bethlehem became part of Jund Filastin in 637. Muslims continued to rule the city until 1099, when it was conquered by the Crusaders, who replaced the local Christian Greek Orthodox clergy with Catholic ones. In the mid-13th century, Bethlehem's walls were demolished by the Mamluk Sultanate. However, they were rebuilt by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century when it came to control the region. After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Bethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine until 1948, and later of the West Bank that was annexed by Jordan following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Bethlehem was occupied by Israel along with the rest of the West Bank. Since the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority, Bethlehem has been designated as part of Area A of the West Bank, nominally rendering it as being under Palestinian control, but it remains under Israeli occupation. Movement around the city is limited due to the Israeli West Bank barrier.\nHistorically, it was a city of Arab Christians, who made up about 86% of the population in 1950, but this community has dwindled significantly to 10% as of 2022, and now has a majority of Arab Muslims.\n\nEtymology\nThe current name for Bethlehem in local languages is  /Bēt laḥm/ in Arabic (Arabic: بيت لحم), literally meaning \"house of meat\", and Bet Leḥem in Hebrew (Hebrew: בֵּית לֶחֶם), literally \"house of bread\" or \"house of food.\" The city was called in Ancient Greek: Βηθλεέμ Ancient Greek pronunciation: [bɛːtʰle.ém] and in Latin: Bethleem. In Aramaic, the name of Bethlehem was simply the Hebrew name בית לחם, and was pronounced as Beit Lekhem. Evidence for this spelling can be inferred based on the fact that the spelling ܒܝܬܠܚܡ can be found in the Syriac Aramaic version of the bible in Matthew 2 as well as other parts of the book. The letters ܒܝܬܠܚܡ transliterate to ביתלחם. Amarna letter EA290 makes reference to a town bīt-ninurta which has been read as Bit-Lachmi by scholar W. F. Albright, following a proposal by Otto Schroeder in 1815 and making it a potential first historical reference to Bethlehem. This reading is, however, uncertain and has met with objections.\n\n\"House of the god Lahmu\"\nCanaanite and Israelite toponyms starting with beth are interpreted to mean \"house of\", with 'house' understood as 'temple' and the second part of the name indicating the deity the local temple was dedicated to. Accordingly, one longstanding suggestion in scholarship is that the name Bethlehem derives from the Mesopotamian or Canaanite fertility god Laḫmu and his consort sister Lahamu, lahmo being the Chaldean word for \"fertility\". Biblical scholar William F. Albright believed that this hypothesis, first put forth by Otto Schröder, was \"certainly accurate\". Albright noted that the pronunciation of the name had remained essentially the same for 3,500 years, even if the perceived meaning had shifted over time: \"'Temple of the God Lakhmu' in Canaanite, 'House of Bread' in Hebrew and Aramaic, 'House of Meat' in Arabic.\" While Schröder's theory is not widely accepted, it continues to find favour in academic literature over the later literal translations.\n\n\"House of war\"\nAnother suggestion is an association with the root l-h-m \"to fight\", leading to the meaning of \"house of war\" or \"house of fighting\", but this is thought unlikely.\n\nHistory\nCanaanite period\nThe earliest reference to Bethlehem appears in the Amarna correspondence (c. 1400 BCE). In one of his six letters to Pharaoh, Abdi-Heba, the Egyptian-appointed governor of Jerusalem, appeals for aid in retaking Bit-Laḫmi in the wake of disturbances by Apiru mercenaries: \"Now even a town near Jerusalem, Bit-Lahmi by name, a village which once belonged to the king, has fallen to the enemy... Let the king hear the words of your servant Abdi-Heba, and send archers to restore the imperial lands of the king!\"\nIt is thought that the similarity of this name to its modern forms indicates that it was originally a settlement of Canaanites who shared a Semitic cultural and linguistic heritage with the later arrivals. Laḫmu was the Akkadian god of fertility, worshipped by the Canaanites as Leḥem. Some time in the third millennium BCE, Canaanites erected a temple on the hill now known as the Hill of the Nativity, probably dedicated to Laḫmu. The temple, and subsequently the town that formed around it, was then known as Beit Lahama, \"House (Temple) of Lahmu\". By 1200 BC, the area of Bethlehem, as well as much of the region, was conquered by the Philistines, which led the region to be known to the Greeks as \"Philistia\", later corrupted to \"Palestine\".\nA burial ground discovered in spring 2013, and surveyed in 2015 by a joint Italian–Palestinian team found that the necropolis covered 3 hectares (more than 7 acres) and originally contained more than 100 tombs in use between roughly 2200 BCE and 650 BCE. The archaeologists were able to identify at least 30 tombs.\n\nIsraelite and Judean period\nArchaeological confirmation of Bethlehem as a city in the Kingdom of Judah was uncovered in 2012 at the archaeological dig at the City of David in the form of a bulla (seal impression in dried clay) in ancient Hebrew script that reads \"From the town of Bethlehem to the King\". According to the excavators, it was used to seal the string closing a shipment of grain, wine, or other goods sent as a tax payment in the 8th or 7th century BCE.\n\nBiblical scholars believe Bethlehem, located in the \"hill country\" of Judea, may be the same as the Biblical Ephrath, which means \"fertile\", as there is a reference to it in the Book of Micah as Bethlehem Ephrathah or Bethlehem Ephratah. The Hebrew Bible also calls it Beth-Lehem Judah, and the New Testament describes it as the \"City of David\". It is first mentioned in the Bible as the place where the matriarch Rachel died and was buried \"by the wayside\" (Genesis 48:7). Rachel's Tomb, the traditional grave site, stands at the entrance to Bethlehem. According to the Book of Ruth, the valley to the east is where Ruth of Moab gleaned the fields and returned to town with Naomi. In the Books of Samuel, Bethlehem is mentioned as the home of Jesse, father of King David of Israel, and the site of David's anointment by the prophet Samuel. It was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his warriors brought him water when he was hiding in the cave of Adullam.\nWriting in the 4th century, the Pilgrim of Bordeaux reported that the sepulchers of David, Ezekiel, Asaph, Job, Jesse, and Solomon were located near Bethlehem.\n\nClassical period\nThe Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke represent Jesus as having been born in Bethlehem, known in Aramaic by the Hebrew name בית לחם (Beit Lekhem). However, modern scholars regard the two accounts as contradictory; the Gospel of Mark, the earliest gospel, mentions nothing about Jesus having been born in Bethlehem, saying only that he came from Nazareth. Current scholars are divided on the actual birthplace of Jesus: some believe he was actually born in Nazareth, while others still hold that he was born in Bethlehem.\nNonetheless, the tradition that Jesus was born in Bethlehem was prominent in the early church. Around 155, the apologist Justin Martyr recommended that those who doubted Jesus was really born in Bethlehem could go there and visit the very cave where he was supposed to have been born. The same cave is also referenced by the apocryphal Gospel of James and the fourth-century church historian Eusebius. After the Bar Kokhba revolt (c. 132–136 CE) was crushed, the Roman emperor Hadrian converted the Christian site above the Grotto into a shrine dedicated to the Greek god Adonis, to honour his favourite, the Greek youth Antinous.\nAround 395 CE, Jerome wrote in a letter: \"Bethlehem... belonging now to us... was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz, that is to say, Adonis, and in the cave where once the infant Christ cried, the lover of Venus was lamented.\" Many scholars have taken this letter as evidence that the cave of the nativity over which the Church of the Nativity was later built had at one point been a shrine to the ancient Near Eastern fertility god Tammuz. Eusebius, however, mentions nothing about the cave having been associated with Tammuz and there are no other Patristic sources that suggest Tammuz had a shrine in Bethlehem. Peter Welten has argued that the cave was never dedicated to Tammuz and that Jerome misinterpreted Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual over Tammuz's death. Joan E. Taylor has countered this contention by arguing that Jerome, as an educated man, could not have been so naïve as to mistake Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual for Tammuz.\nIn 326–328, the empress Helena, widowed consort of Emperor Constantius Chlorus and mother of the ruling emperor, Constantine the Great, made a pilgrimage to Syria-Palaestina, in the course of which she visited the ruins of Bethlehem. The Church of the Nativity was built at her initiative over the cave where Jesus was purported to have been born. During the Samaritan revolt of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the Church of the Nativity destroyed; they were rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor Justinian I. In 614, the Persian Sassanid Empire, supported by Jewish rebels, invaded Palestina Prima and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the magi depicted in Persian clothing in a mosaic.\n\nMiddle Ages\nIn 637, shortly after Jerusalem was captured by the Muslim armies, 'Umar ibn al-Khattāb, the second caliph, promised that the Church of the Nativity would be preserved for Christian use. A mosque dedicated to Umar was built upon the place in the city where he prayed, next to the church. Bethlehem then passed through the control of the Islamic caliphates of the Umayyads in the 8th century, then the Abbasids in the 9th century. A Persian geographer recorded in the mid-9th century that a well preserved and much venerated church existed in the town. In 985, the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi visited Bethlehem, and referred to its church as the \"Basilica of Constantine, the equal of which does not exist anywhere in the country-round.\" In 1009, during the reign of the sixth Fatimid Caliph, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the Church of the Nativity was ordered to be demolished, but was spared by local Muslims, because they had been permitted to worship in the structure's southern transept.\nIn 1099, Bethlehem was captured by the Crusaders, who fortified it and built a new monastery and cloister on the north side of the Church of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox clergy were removed from their sees and replaced with Latin clerics. Up until that point the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100, Baldwin I, first king of the Frankish Kingdom of Jerusalem, was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.\nIn 1187, Saladin, the Sultan of Egypt and Syria who led the Muslim Ayyubids, captured Bethlehem from the Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered from the loss of the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims. William IV, Count of Nevers had promised the Christian bishops of Bethlehem that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them in the small town of Clamecy in present-day Burgundy, France. As a result, the Bishop of Bethlehem duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy, in 1223. Clamecy remained the continuous 'in partibus infidelium' seat of the Bishopric of Bethlehem for almost 600 years, until the French Revolution in 1789.\nBethlehem, along with Jerusalem, Nazareth, and Sidon, was briefly ceded to the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem by a treaty between Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and Ayyubid Sultan al-Kamil in 1229, in return for a ten-year truce between the Ayyubids and the Crusaders. The treaty expired in 1239, and Bethlehem was recaptured by the Muslims in 1244. In 1250, with the coming to power of the Mamluks under Rukn al-Din Baibars, tolerance of Christianity declined. Members of the clergy left the city, and in 1263 the town walls were demolished. The Latin clergy returned to Bethlehem the following century, establishing themselves in the monastery adjoining the Basilica of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox were given control of the basilica and shared control of the Milk Grotto with the Latins and the Armenians.\n\nOttoman era\nFrom 1517, during the years of Ottoman control, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches. By the end of the 16th century, Bethlehem had become one of the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was subdivided into seven quarters. The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among other leaders during this period. The Ottoman tax record and census from 1596 indicates that Bethlehem had a population of 1,435, making it the 13th largest village in Palestine at the time. Its total revenue amounted to 30,000 akce.\nBethlehem paid taxes on wheat, barley and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were organized into separate communities, each having its own leader. Five leaders represented the village in the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population was slightly more prosperous or grew more grain than grapes (the former being a more valuable commodity).\n\nFrom 1831 to 1841, Palestine was under the rule of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty of Egypt. During this period, the town suffered an earthquake as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops, apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of Ibrahim Pasha, during the Peasants' revolt in Palestine. In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once again and remained so until the end of World War I. Under the Ottomans, Bethlehem's inhabitants faced unemployment, compulsory military service, and heavy taxes, resulting in mass emigration, particularly to South America. An American missionary in the 1850s reported a population of under 4,000, nearly all of whom belonged to the Greek Church. He also noted that a lack of water limited the town's growth.\nSocin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870 that Bethlehem had a population of 179 Muslims in 59 houses, 979 \"Latins\" in 256 houses, 824 \"Greeks\" in 213 houses, and 41 Armenians in 11 houses, a total of 539 houses. The population count only included men. Hartmann found that Bethlehem had 520 houses.\n\nModern era\nBethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine from 1920 to 1948. In the United Nations General Assembly's 1947 resolution to partition Palestine, Bethlehem was included in the international enclave of Jerusalem to be administered by the United Nations. Jordan captured the city during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Many refugees from areas captured by Israeli forces in 1947–48 fled to the Bethlehem area, primarily settling in what became the official refugee camps of 'Azza (Beit Jibrin) and 'Aida in the north and Dheisheh in the south. The influx of refugees significantly transformed Bethlehem's Christian majority into a Muslim one.\nJordan retained control of the city until the Six-Day War in 1967, when Bethlehem was captured by Israel, along with the rest of the West Bank. Following the Six-Day War, Israel took control of the city.\n\nDuring the early months of First Intifada, on 5 May 1989, Milad Anton Shahin, aged 12, was shot dead by Israeli soldiers. Replying to a Member of Knesset in August 1990 Defence Minister Yitzak Rabin stated that a group of reservists in an observation post had come under attack by stone throwers. The commander of the post, a senior non-commissioned officer, fired two plastic bullets in deviation of operational rules. No evidence was found that this caused the boy's death. The officer was found guilty of illegal use of a weapon and sentenced to 5 months imprisonment, two of them actually in prison doing public service. He was also demoted.\nOn December 21, 1995, Israeli troops withdrew from Bethlehem, and three days later the city came under the administration and military control of the Palestinian National Authority in accordance with the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. During the Second Palestinian Intifada in 2000–2005, Bethlehem's infrastructure and tourism industry were damaged. In 2002, it was a primary combat zone in Operation Defensive Shield, a major military counteroffensive by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF besieged the Church of the Nativity, where dozens of Palestinian militants had sought refuge. The siege lasted 39 days. Several militants were killed. It ended with an agreement to exile 13 of the militants to foreign countries.\n\nToday, the city is surrounded by two bypass roads for Israeli settlers, leaving the inhabitants squeezed between thirty-seven Jewish enclaves, where a quarter of all West Bank settlers, roughly 170,000, live; the gap between the two roads is closed by the 8-metre high Israeli West Bank barrier, which cuts Bethlehem off from its sister city Jerusalem. Christian families that have lived in Bethlehem for hundreds of years are being forced to leave as land in Bethlehem is seized, and homes bulldozed, for construction of thousands of new Israeli homes. Land seizures for Israeli settlements have also prevented construction of a new hospital for the inhabitants of Bethlehem, as well as the barrier separating dozens of Palestinian families from their farmland and Christian communities from their places of worship. Christians have reportedly suffered persecution under the Palestinian Authority, leading to emigration.\n\nGeography\nBethlehem is located at an elevation of about 775 meters (2,543 ft) above sea level, 30 meters (98 ft) higher than nearby Jerusalem. Bethlehem is situated on the Judean Mountains.\nThe city is located 73 kilometers (45 mi) northeast of Gaza City and the Mediterranean Sea, 75 kilometers (47 mi) west of Amman, Jordan, 59 kilometers (37 mi) southeast of Tel Aviv, Israel and 10 kilometers (6 mi) south of Jerusalem. Nearby cities and towns include Beit Safafa and Jerusalem to the north, Beit Jala to the northwest, Husan to the west, al-Khadr and Artas to the southwest, and Beit Sahour to the east. Beit Jala and the latter form an agglomeration with Bethlehem. The Aida and Azza refugee camps are located within the city limits.\nIn the center of Bethlehem is its old city. The old city consists of eight quarters, laid out in a mosaic style, forming the area around the Manger Square. The quarters include the Christian an-Najajreh, al-Farahiyeh, al-Anatreh, al-Tarajmeh, al-Qawawsa and Hreizat quarters and al-Fawaghreh—the only Muslim quarter. Most of the Christian quarters are named after the Arab Ghassanid clans that settled there. Al-Qawawsa Quarter was formed by Arab Christian emigrants from the nearby town of Tuqu' in the 18th century. There is also a Syriac quarter outside of the old city, whose inhabitants originate from Midyat and Ma'asarte in Turkey. The total population of the old city is about 5,000.\n\nClimate\nBethlehem has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa), with hot and dry summers and mild, wetter winters. Winter temperatures (mid-December to mid-March) can be cool and rainy. January is the coldest month, with temperatures ranging from 1 to 13 degree Celsius (33–55 °F). From May through September, the weather is warm and sunny. August is the hottest month, with a high of 30 degrees Celsius (86 °F). Bethlehem receives an average of 700 millimeters (28 in) of rainfall annually, 70% between November and January.\nBethlehem's average annual relative humidity is 60% and reaches its highest rates between January and February. Humidity levels are at their lowest in May. Night dew may occur in up to 180 days per year. The city is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea breeze that occurs around mid-day. However, Bethlehem is affected also by annual waves of hot, dry, sandy and dust Khamaseen winds from the Arabian Desert, during April, May and mid-June.\n\nDemographics\nPopulation\nAccording to Ottoman tax records, Christians made up roughly 60% of the population in the early 16th century, while the Christian and Muslim populations became equal by the middle of that century. However, there were no Muslim inhabitants counted by the end of the century, with a recorded population of 287 adult male taxpayers. Christians, like all non-Muslims throughout the Ottoman Empire, were required to pay the jizya tax. In 1867, an American visitor describes the town as having a population of 3,000 to 4,000, of whom about 100 were Protestant, 300 were Muslim and \"the remainder belonging to the Latin and Greek Churches with a few Armenians.\" Another report from the same year puts the Christian population at 3,000, with an additional 50 Muslims. An 1885 source put the population at approximately 6,000 of \"principally Christians, Latins and Greeks\" with no Jewish inhabitants.\nThe census of 1922 lists Bethlehem as having 6,658 residents (5,838 Christians, 818 Muslims, and two Jews), increasing in 1931 to 6,804 (5,588 Christians, 1,219 Muslims, five with no religion, and two Jews) with 506 in nearby suburbs (251 Muslims, 216 Christians, and 39 Jews).\nThe 1938 village statistics list the population as 7,520 with 499 in nearby suburbs (including 42 Jews). The 1945 village statistics list Bethlehem's population as 8,820 (6,430 Christians, 2,370 Muslims, and 20 \"other\").\nIn 1948, the religious makeup of the city was 85% Christian, mostly of the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic denominations, and 13% Muslim. In the 1967 census taken by Israel authorities, the town of Bethlehem proper numbered 14,439 inhabitants, its 7,790 Muslim inhabitants represented 53.9% of the population, while the Christians of various denominations numbered 6,231 or 46.1%.\nIn the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 21,670, including a total of 6,570 refugees, accounting for 30.3% of the city's population. In 1997, the age distribution of Bethlehem's inhabitants was 27.4% under the age of 10, 20% from 10 to 19, 17.3% from 20 to 29, 17.7% from 30 to 44, 12.1% from 45 to 64 and 5.3% above the age of 65. There were 11,079 males and 10,594 females. In the 2007 PCBS census, Bethlehem had a population of 25,266, of which 12,753 were males and 12,513 were females. There were 6,709 housing units, of which 5,211 were households. The average household consisted of 4.8 family members. By 2017, the population was 28,591.\n\nChristian population\nAfter the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 630s, the local Christians were Arabized even though large numbers were ethnically Arabs of the Ghassanid clans. Bethlehem's two largest Arab Christian clans trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids, including al-Farahiyyah and an-Najajreh. The former have descended from the Ghassanids who migrated from Yemen and from the Wadi Musa area in present-day Jordan and an-Najajreh descend from Najran. Another Bethlehem clan, al-Anatreh, also trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids.\nThe percentage of Christians in the town has been in a steady decline since the mid-twentieth century. In 1947, Christians made up 85% of the population, but by 1998, the figure had declined to 40%. In 2005, the mayor of Bethlehem, Victor Batarseh, explained that \"due to the stress, either physical or psychological, and the bad economic situation, many people are emigrating, either Christians or Muslims, but it is more apparent among Christians, because they already are a minority.\" The Palestinian Authority is officially committed to equality for Christians, although there have been incidents of violence against them by the Preventive Security Service and militant factions.\nIn 2006, a Zogby poll that interviewed more than 1,000 Palestinian Christians from Bethlehem found that 79% of the respondents cited the Israeli occupation as source of difficulties leading the emigration of their community. In the same year, the Palestinian Centre for Research and Cultural Dialogue conducted a poll among the city's Christians according to which 90% said they had had Muslim friends, 73.3% agreed that the PNA treated Christian heritage in the city with respect and 78% attributed the exodus of Christians to the Israeli blockade. The only mosque in the Old City is the Mosque of Omar, located in the Manger Square. By 2016, the Christian population of Bethlehem had declined to only 16%. The Christian population's proportion of Bethlehem fell from 87% in the 1950s to 12% in 2016.\nA study by Pew Research Center concluded that the decline in the Arab Christian population of the area was partially a result of a lower birth rate among Christians than among Muslims, but also partially due to the fact that Christians were more likely to emigrate from the region than any other religious group. The seizure of Christian land by Muslim mafias and the bias of the Palestinian Judicial system have been cited as reasons leading to emigration. Amon Ramnon, a researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, stated that the reason why more Christians were emigrating than Muslims is because it is easier for Arab Christians to integrate into western communities than for Arab Muslims, since many of them attend church-affiliated schools, where they are taught European languages. A higher percentage of Christians in the region are urban-dwellers, which also makes it easier for them to emigrate and assimilate into western populations. A statistical analysis of the Christian exodus cited lack of economic and educational opportunity, especially due to the Christians' middle-class status and higher education. Since the Second Intifada, 10% of the Christian population have left the city. However, it is likely that there are many other factors, most of which are shared with the Palestinian population as a whole.\n\nEconomy\nShopping is a major attraction, especially during the Christmas season. The city's main streets and old markets are lined with shops selling Palestinian handicrafts, Middle Eastern spices, jewelry and oriental sweets such as baklawa. Olive wood carvings are the item most purchased by tourists visiting Bethlehem. Religious handicrafts include ornaments handmade from mother-of-pearl, as well as olive wood statues, boxes, and crosses. Other industries include stone and marble-cutting, textiles, furniture and furnishings. Bethlehem factories also produce paints, plastics, synthetic rubber, pharmaceuticals, construction materials and food products, mainly pasta and confectionery.\nCremisan Wine, founded in 1885, is a winery run by monks in the Monastery of Cremisan. The grapes are grown mainly in the al-Khader district. In 2007, the monastery's wine production was around 700,000 liters per year.\nIn 2008, Bethlehem hosted the largest economic conference to date in the Palestinian territories. It was initiated by Palestinian Prime Minister and former Finance Minister Salam Fayyad to convince more than a thousand businessmen, bankers and government officials from throughout the Middle East to invest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A total of 1.4 billion US dollars was secured for business investments in the Palestinian territories. Tourism is Bethlehem's main industry. Unlike other Palestinian localities prior to 2000, the majority of the employed residents did not have jobs in Israel. More than 20% of the working population is employed in the industry. Tourism accounts for approximately 65% of the city's economy and 11% of the Palestinian National Authority. The city has more than two million visitors every year. Tourism in Bethlehem ground to a halt for over a decade after the Second Intifada, but gradually began to pick back up in the early 2010s. Schneider Electric operates a facility in the Multidisciplinary Industrial Park of Bethlehem, which was developed by the Palestinian government and France.\nThe Church of the Nativity is one of Bethlehem's major tourist attractions and a magnet for Christian pilgrims. It stands in the center of the city — a part of the Manger Square — over a grotto or cave called the Holy Crypt, where Jesus is believed to have been born. Nearby is the Milk Grotto where the Holy Family took refuge on their Flight to Egypt and next door is the cave where St. Jerome spent thirty years creating the Vulgate, the dominant Latin version of the Bible until the Reformation. There are over thirty hotels in Bethlehem. Jacir Palace, built in 1910 near the church, is one of Bethlehem's most successful hotels and its oldest. It was closed down in 2000 due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but reopened in 2005 as the Jacir Palace InterContinental at Bethlehem. The hotel is managed by world renowned international brand — the Intercontinental Hotel Group (IHG) and is second IHG hotel in the country after IHG in Jerusalem.\n\nReligious significance and commemoration\nBirthplace of Jesus\nIn the New Testament, the Gospel of Luke says that Jesus' parents traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. The Gospel of Matthew mentions Bethlehem as the place of birth, and adds that King Herod was told that a 'King of the Jews' had been born in the town, prompting Herod to order the killing of all the boys who were two years old or under in the town and surrounding area. Joseph, warned of Herod's impending action by an angel of the Lord, decided to flee to Egypt with his family and then later settled in Nazareth after Herod's death.\nEarly Christian traditions describe Jesus as being born in Bethlehem: in one account, a verse in the Book of Micah is interpreted as a prophecy that the Messiah would be born there. The second century Christian apologist Justin Martyr stated in his Dialogue with Trypho (written c. 155–161) that the Holy Family had taken refuge in a cave outside of the town and then placed Jesus in a manger. Origen of Alexandria, writing around the year 247, referred to a cave in the town of Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus. This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site of the cult of Tammuz. The Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Galilee. However, other archaeologists argue that there is evidence that Bethlehem of Judea was inhabited at that time. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.\n\nChristmas celebrations\nChristmas rites are held in Bethlehem on three different dates: December 25 is the traditional date by the Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations, but Greek, Coptic and Syrian Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on January 6 and Armenian Orthodox Christians on January 19. Most Christmas processions pass through Manger Square, the plaza outside the Basilica of the Nativity. Roman Catholic services take place in St. Catherine's Church and Protestants often hold services at Shepherds' Fields.\n\nOther religious festivals\nBethlehem celebrates festivals related to saints and prophets associated with Palestinian folklore. One such festival is the annual Feast of Saint George (al-Khadr) on May 5–6. During the celebrations, Greek Orthodox Christians from the city march in procession to the nearby town of al-Khader to baptize newborns in the waters around the Monastery of St. George and sacrifice a sheep in ritual. The Feast of St. Elijah is commemorated by a procession to Mar Elias, a Greek Orthodox monastery north of Bethlehem.\n\nCulture\nEmbroidery\nThe women embroiderers of Bethlehem were known for their bridalwear. Bethlehem embroidery was renowned for its \"strong overall effect of colors and metallic brilliance.\" Less formal dresses were made of indigo fabric with a sleeveless coat (bisht) from locally woven wool worn over top. Dresses for special occasions were made of striped silk with winged sleeves with a short taqsireh jacket known as the Bethlehem jacket. The taqsireh was made of velvet or broadcloth, usually with heavy embroidery.\n\nBethlehem work was unique in its use of couched gold or silver cord, or silk cord onto the silk, wool, felt or velvet used for the garment, to create stylized floral patterns with free or rounded lines. This technique was used for \"royal\" wedding dresses (thob malak), taqsirehs and the shatwehs worn by married women. It has been traced by some to Byzantium, and by others to the formal costumes of the Ottoman Empire's elite. As a Christian village, local women were also exposed to the detailing on church vestments with their heavy embroidery and silver brocade.\n\nMother-of-pearl carving\nThe art of mother-of-pearl carving is said to have been a Bethlehem tradition since the 15th century when it was introduced by Franciscan friars from Italy. A constant stream of pilgrims generated a demand for these items, which also provided jobs for women. The industry was noted by Richard Pococke, who visited Bethlehem in 1727.\n\nCultural centers and museums\nBethlehem is home to the Palestinian Heritage Center, established in 1991. The center aims to preserve and promote Palestinian embroidery, art and folklore. The International Center of Bethlehem is another cultural center that concentrates primarily on the culture of Bethlehem. It provides language and guide training, woman's studies and arts and crafts displays, and training.\n\nThe Bethlehem branch of the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music has about 500 students. Its primary goals are to teach children music, train teachers for other schools, sponsor music research, and the study of Palestinian folklore music.\nBethlehem has several museums: The Crib of the Nativity Theatre and Museum offers visitors 31 three-dimensional models depicting the significant stages of the life of Jesus. Its theater presents a 20-minute animated show. The Badd Giacaman Museum, located in the Old City of Bethlehem, dates back to the 18th century and is primarily dedicated to the history and process of olive oil production. Baituna al-Talhami Museum, established in 1972, contains displays of Bethlehem culture. The International Museum of Nativity was built by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to exhibit \"high artistic quality in an evocative atmosphere\". The Palestine Museum of Natural History is the first of its kind and is based on Bethlehem University campus.\n\nLocal government\nBethlehem is the muhfaza (seat) or district capital of the Bethlehem Governorate.\nBethlehem held its first municipal elections in 1876, after the mukhtars (\"heads\") of the quarters of Bethlehem's Old City (excluding the Syriac Quarter) made the decision to elect a local council of seven members to represent each clan in the town. A Basic Law was established so that if the victor for mayor was a Catholic, his deputy should be of the Greek Orthodox community.\n\nThroughout, Bethlehem's rule by the British and Jordan, the Syriac Quarter was allowed to participate in the election, as were the Ta'amrah Bedouins and Palestinian refugees, hence ratifying the number of municipal members in the council to 11. In 1976, an amendment was passed to allow women to vote and become council members and later the voting age was increased from 21 to 25.\nThere are several branches of political parties on the council, including Communist, Islamist, and secular. The leftist factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Palestinian People's Party (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. Hamas gained the majority of the open seats in the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections.\n\nMayors\nIn the October 2012 municipal elections, Fatah member Vera Baboun won, becoming the first female mayor of Bethlehem.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, approximately 84% of Bethlehem's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 10,414 were enrolled in schools (4,015 in primary school, 3,578 in secondary and 2,821 in high school). About 14.1% of high school students received diplomas. There were 135 schools in the Bethlehem Governorate in 2006; 100 run the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, seven by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 28 were private.\n\nBethlehem is home to Bethlehem University, a Catholic Christian co-educational institution of higher learning founded in 1973 in the Lasallian tradition, open to students of all faiths. Bethlehem University is the first university established in the West Bank, and can trace its roots to 1893 when the De La Salle Christian Brothers opened schools throughout Palestine and Egypt.\n\nTransportation\nBethlehem has three bus stations owned by private companies which offer service to Jerusalem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahour, Hebron, Nahalin, Battir, al-Khader, al-Ubeidiya and Beit Fajjar. There are two taxi stations that make trips to Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, Jerusalem, Tuqu' and Herodium. There are also two car rental departments: Murad and 'Orabi. Buses and taxis with West Bank licenses are not allowed to enter Israel, including Jerusalem, without a permit.\nThe Israeli construction of the West Bank barrier has affected Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier is located along the northern side of the town's built-up area, within distance of houses in the Aida refugee camp on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other. Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration to the rest of the West Bank are currently subjected to Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical Solomon's Pools.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nBethlehem is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nBethlehem of Galilee\nBethlehem, Pennsylvania\nBethlehem, Wales\nStar of Bethlehem\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nBethlehem Municipality\nWelcome To The City of Bethlehem\nOpen Bethlehem civil society project Archived April 19, 2010, at the Wayback Machine\nPhoto: Christmas in Bethlehem, 2008 Archived November 23, 2017, at the Wayback Machine\nBethlehem Fair Trade Artisans\nBethlehem University\nBethlehem aerial photo, Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem",
          "summary": "Bethlehem is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, located about ten kilometres (six miles) south of Jerusalem, and the capital of the Bethlehem Governorate. It had a population of 28,591 people, as of 2017. The city's economy is strongly linked to tourism, especially during the Christmas period, when Christians embark on a pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, which is revered as the location of the birth of Jesus.\nA possible first mention of Bethlehem is in the Amarna correspondence of ancient Egypt, dated to 1350–1330 BCE, although that reading is uncertain. In the Hebrew Bible, the period of the Israelites is described; it identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of David. In the New Testament, the city is identified as the birthplace of Jesus of Nazareth. Under the Roman Empire, the city of Bethlehem was destroyed by Hadrian, but later rebuilt by Constantine the Great, who commissioned the Church of the Nativity in 327 CE. In 529, the Church of the Nativity was heavily damaged by Samaritans involved in the Samaritan revolts; following the victory of the Byzantine Empire, it was rebuilt by Justinian I.\nLater, during the rule of several Caliphates, Bethlehem became part of Jund Filastin in 637. Muslims continued to rule the city until 1099, when it was conquered by the Crusaders, who replaced the local Christian Greek Orthodox clergy with Catholic ones. In the mid-13th century, Bethlehem's walls were demolished by the Mamluk Sultanate. However, they were rebuilt by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century when it came to control the region. After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Bethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine until 1948, and later of the West Bank that was annexed by Jordan following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Bethlehem was occupied by Israel along with the rest of the West Bank. Since the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority, Bethlehem has been designated as part of Area A of the West Bank, nominally rendering it as being under Palestinian control, but it remains under Israeli occupation. Movement around the city is limited due to the Israeli West Bank barrier.\nHistorically, it was a city of Arab Christians, who made up about 86% of the population in 1950, but this community has dwindled significantly to 10% as of 2022, and now has a majority of Arab Muslims.",

          "content": "بَيْت لَحم (بالسريانيه: ܒܝܬ ܠܚܡ؛ باليونانيه: Βηθλεὲμ؛ باللاتينيه: Bethleem) هي مدينه فلسطينيه، ومركز محافظه بيت لحم. تقع في الضفه الغربيه التابعه للسلطه الفلسطينيه على بعد 10 كم الى الجنوب من القدس. يبلغ عدد سكانها 30,000 نسمه بدون سكان مخيمات اللاجئين. وتعتبر مركزاً للثقافه والسياحه في فلسطين.\nللمدينه اهميه عظيمه لدى المسيحيين لكونها مسقط راس يسوع (عيسى). تضم بيت لحم العديد من الكنائس، ولعل اهمها كنيسه المهد، التي بنيت على يد قسطنطين الاكبر (330 م). وقد بنيت الكنيسه فوق كهف او مغاره يعتقد انها مذود البقر الذي ولد فيه يسوع. ويعتقد ان هذه الكنيسه هي اقدم الكنائس الموجوده في العالم. كما ان هناك سرداباً اخر قريب يعتقد ان جيروم قضى فيه ثلاثين عاماً من حياته يترجم الكتاب المقدس.\nبنيت المدينه وفقًا لعلماء الاثار على يد الكنعانيين في الالف الثاني قبل الميلاد، وعُرفت بعدد من الاسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسمها في مصادر قدماء السريان والاراميين. وقد مرَّ على المدينه عدد من الغزاه عبر التاريخ، حيث تعرّضت بيت لحم هي وبقيه فلسطين للفتح الاشوري والبابلي والفارسي والاغريقي والروماني والبيزنطي. واُعيد بناؤها من قبل الامبراطور البيزنطي جستنيان الاول. وفتحها العرب المسلمون على يد عمر بن الخطاب عام 637م. وفي عام 1099م، احتلها الصليبيون الذين حصنوها واستبدلوا فيها الارثوذكسيه اليونانيه برجال الدين اللاتين. وقد طُرد هؤلاء رجال الدين اللاتين بعد ان فتح المدينه صلاح الدين الايوبي. ومع مجيء المماليك في عام 1250م، هُدمت جدران المدينه واعيد بناؤها في وقت لاحق خلال حكم الامبراطوريه العثمانيه. في عام 1917 انتزعت بريطانيا السيطره على المدينه من العثمانيين خلال الحرب العالميه الاولى وكان من المفترض ان تُضمّن في المنطقه الدوليه في اطار خطه الامم المتحده لتقسيم فلسطين عام 1947. واُلحقت المدينه بالاردن بعد نكبه فلسطين عام 1948. وقد احتلتها اسرائيل في عام 1967 بحرب الايام السته. ومنذ عام 1995، ووفقاً لاتفاقيه اوسلو، نُقلت السلطات المدنيه والامنيه في المدينه الى يد السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه.\nتقع بيت لحم ضمن سلسله جبال القدس، وترتفع عن سطح البحر 775 متراً. وتعتبر المدينه تاريخياً منطقه مسيحيه السكان، الا ان معظم سكانها اليوم هم من المسلمين، ولكنها لا زالت موطناً لواحد من اكبر المجتمعات المسيحيه الفلسطينيه.\nلبيت لحم دور رئيس في القطاع الاقتصادي الفلسطيني من خلال السياحه التي تزداد اثناء موسم عيد الميلاد عندما يحتشد الحجاج المسيحيون الى كنيسه المهد، حيث يوجد في بيت لحم اكثر من 30 فندقاً و 300 ورشه عمل للحرف اليدويه. ويسكن هذه المدينه احد اقدم المجتمعات المسيحيه في العالم على الرغم من تقلص حجمه بسبب الهجره. اختيرت المدينه عاصمه الثقافه العربيه للعام 2020. وسجّلت مدينه بيت لحم اول اصابات بفايروس كورونا التاجي «كوفيد-19» لتصبح اول مدينه تغلق في فلسطين لمده زادت عن 70 يوماً.\n\nالتسميه\nكان يقع ضمن موقعها مکان عباده كنعاني يدعى بیراث اربع او برج اربع، باسم جد الكنعانيين، فتوارث الاسرائيليون المكان والتقاليد فقدموا الذبائح لالههم يهوه في برج اربع، ويعزو البعض تسميه المدينه بيت لحم بسبب وجود مائده التقدمه في هذا المكان (صموئيل الاول 9 : 12، 20 : 6، 6 : 29) - ویسمی تلمود اورشلیم المغاره الكبيره في افراتا باسم جد الادوميين والعرب الذين ينتمي لهم الكميتيون والكنسينيون وينتسب لهم كالب، فيُقرا في \"مدراش ایکا رباني\" (68 : 3) \"في ببرات اربع في اليهوديه ياتي المسيا للعالم\". وتشير الملاحظه التابعه ان پيرات اربع هي مكان في بيت لحم وتدعي كذلك \"بيرات ملكا\" نسبه الى برج الملك. وتذكر \"اخبار الايام الاولى في التوراه (11 : 16) \"وكان داود حينئذ، في الحصن بينما جنود الفلسطينيين يحاصرون بيت لحم\".\nوذكر نومكينز في مجله مؤسسه الاثار الفلسطينيه الربع سنويه  ان المكان كان مرکراً لاله الخصب الكلداني «لاحمو» وذكرته رسائل تل العمارنه باسم بیت ايلي لاحاما. وكان الكنعانيون يقيمون البيوت لالهتهم اينما اعتقدوا بوجودها وكانت منطقه بيت لحم بسيولها الخصبه اهلا ان يسكنها اله الخصب. فبنوا له معبدا يطل على السيول دعي «بيت ايلي لاحاما» الذي بقي على مر العصور وتقلب الشعوب. واي اسم اجدر واقدس من اسم اله لتحافظ عليه وتحترمه وتتوارته الاقوام اللاحقه. كما ذكر المؤرخ الالماني، و.شريدر في جريده الاداب الشرقيه عدد 18 لعام 1915م عن صفائح رسائل تل العمارنه ان هذا الراي في التسميه قد ثبت وتمكن. بينما التفسيرات العبرانيه لاسم بیت لحم ببيت الخبز فهي شعبيه ترکت نهائيا.\nظهر راي يتردد في المراجع بالرغم من عدم صحته وهو ان قبيله عربيه تدعم لخم سكنت هذه المنطقه، بعد نزوحها من الجزيره العربيه خمسمئه عام قبل الميلاد عندما نزح المنائيون ولحق بهم قبیلتا لخم وجذام، فسكن اللخميون الصحراء ما بين الرمله ومصر وقسم منهم في الجولان وحوران وباسان حتى مدينه نوا، اما الجذامیون فسكنوا غور الاردن من طبريا حتى اللجون، يمون وعكا، ويكفي النظر الى تاريخ النزوح لننفي اي علاقه باسم بيت لحم الذي ذكر قبل 1800 عام قبل الميلاد. وليس لدوله اللخميين في الحيره في العراق كذلك اي علاقه لتسميه بيت لحم. اذ ظهرت دوله اللخميين حوالي القرن الخامس ميلادي فقط.\nودُعيت ببيت لحم بافراتا وهي كلمه كلدانيه معناها الخصبه (تكوين 35 : 16، 19) (منيحا 5 : 2) (راعوت 4)، وذكر المورخ اليهودي يوسفوس فلافيوس\" ان راحيل\nدفنت في بلاد افراتا\". وجدير بالذكر ان القمح البري وجد في هذه المنطقه.\nوبني الكنعانيون بيتا اخر «لايلي لاحاما» في شمال البلاد في الجليل الى الشمال الغربي من مدينه الناصره وعلى بعد احد عشر كيلومترا منها، ذكرتها التوراه عده مرات ولربما كانت اكثر اهميه من بيت لحم الجنوب لخصب محیطها وغنى اهلها. وكانت تابعه لسبط زبلون زمن الاسرائيليين: (يشوع 19 : 10)، (قضاه 12 : 8) \nشيد الالمان الهيكليون قريتهم ببيت لحم على اثار بیت لحم القديمه عام 1901م، وبقيت مزدهره حتى احتلها اليهود عام 1948 لتصبح يهوديه، وللتفرقه عرفت بيت لحم الجنوبيه باليهوديه والشماليه ببيت لحم الجليل.\nوبظهور النبي داوود في بيت لحم الصغرى بزغ اسمها من الظلمه الى النور، اذ جاء صموئيل النبي الى بيت لحم ليصبح ابن يسي الاصغر ملكا على اليهود (صموئيل الاول 16 : 1). وفي يوم التقدمه عند اليهود سكب صموئيل الزيت من الفرن على راس داوود واخذ اسم هذا يعلو على اسم شاول الملك انذاك فامتلا حقدا عليه. ويذكر (صموئيل الاول 20 : 29) کیف اختبا داوود من شاول خوفا منه اذ حاول قتله. واعتذر یوناشاس ابن شاول لابيه عن صديقه داوود لعدم حضوره وليمه الملك بانه ذهب الى بيت لحم بمناسبه راس الشهر القمري ليقدم الذبيحه مع اهله: وتقديم الذبيحه على هيكل مقدس، طقس، لا بد وان الاسرائيليون توارثوه عن الكنعانين - بنت ايلي لاحاما. ويعتقد ان هذا البيت المقدس كان يطل على السهول الخصبه والصحراء الشرقيه حيث تقوم اليوم المقدسات المسيحيه، حيث اشتعلت نيران التقدمه لترضي ايلي لاحاما الكنعاني وثم التهمت النيران قرابين الاسرائيليين لترضي الاههم يهوه، ثم جاءت المسيحيه فالوثنيه فالمسيحيه ثانيه لتشيد مقدساتها على انقاض المقدسات السالفه.\n\nودعي داود بابن يسى الافراتي (صموئيل الاول 17 : 12)  وينسب اليمالك والد زوج راعوث الى هذا النسب ايضا (راعوث 1 : 2) ولما تزوج بوعاز التلحمي من راعوث الارمله تمني له مواطنوه «ان يزدهر بيتها في افراتا ويشتهر في بيت لحم» (راعوت 4 : 11)  وانجبت راعوثم بن بوعاز ابنا هو عوبید والد يسی والد داوود. فاصبح اسم هذا النسل مربتوا باسم بيت لحم، وذكر ميخا في نبواته (5 : 2) حوالي 750 عام قبل الميلاد: «اما ات يا بيت لحم افراته وانت صغيره ان تكوني بين اوف يهوذا، فمنك يخرج لي الذي يكون متسلطا على اسرائيل ومخارجه منذ القديم، منذ ايام الازل» \nكذلك ذكر في (اخبار الايام الاولى 2 : 19، 24، 50) ان هذا النسل الذي كان يسكن محيط بيت لحم (بيت افرات) ينسب دائما لافراتا. وكل هذا يشهد ان الاسم افراتا اطلق على المنطقه التي مركزها بيت لحم.\n\nالتاريخ\nالعهد الكنعاني\nلقد سكن الكنعانيون المدينه سنه 2000 ق.م، ويروى ان النبي يعقوب جاء الى هذه المدينه وهو في طريقه الى الخليل، وماتت زوجته راحيل في مكان قريب من بيت لحم يعرف اليوم بقبه راحيل وفي بيت لحم ولد الملك داوود. وتوالت عليها الاحداث، وكانت في العصور القديمه قريه متواضعه تكتنفها الاوديه العميقه من جهاتها الثلاث. وكانت خصبه الموقع تنتشر فيها حقول القمح. وفي القرن الرابع عشر قبل الميلاد -\tظهرت في مخطوطات تل العمارنه منطقه اسمها بيت لحم وذلك عند الحديث عن انباء الحروب التي قامت جنوب القدس. من المحتمل ان اول استيطان بشري وقع فيها عندما حطت بعض جماعات من البدو حول النبع الواقع على بعد 200 متر من كنيسه الميلاد.\nتظهرُ اول اشاره تاريخيه الى المدينه في رسائل تل العمارنه (حوالي 1400 قبل الميلاد) عندما ناشد ملك القدس سيده الاعلى، ملك مصر، للحصول على المُساعده لاستعاده السيطره على «بيت - لحمي» في اعقاب الاضطرابات من جانب عبيرو. ويعتقد ان تشابه هذا الاسم مع شكلها الحديث يدُل على انها كانت مُستوطنه كنعانيه، الذين يملُكون ثقافيه ولغويه ساميه مع الوافدين على المدينه لاحقًا.\n\nبعد الميلاد\nفي عام 325 بعد اعلان حريه التعبد للديانه المسيحيه، طلب القديس مكاريوس بطريرك القدس من الامبراطور ان يعيد المكان المقدس، فبنت القديسه هيلانه بازيليك الميلاد. في عام 384 مع وصول القديس هيرونيموس الى بيت لحم قام في المدينه مركز عباده لاتيني دام بعد وفاته سنين عديده. في عام 614 ادّى غزو جيوش كسرى الى خراب اليهوديه ولم ينج من بيت لحم سوى بازيليك الميلاد وذلك كما يقال بفضل رسم للمجوس قائم على جدار البازيليك. والمجوس وهم ملوك الفرس الذين سجدوا ليسوع الطفل بحسب الروايه الانجيليه.\n\nاستمدت بيت لحم شهرتها العالميه الكبرى من مولد يسوع فيها. ويروى ان يوسف النجار، ومريم العذراء ذهبا الى بيت لحم لتسجيل اسمهما في الاحصاء العام، فولدت مريم وليدها هناك. وترى المصادر المسيحيه ان الولاده كانت في مغاره قريبه من القريه، ولكن القران (يقول): (فاجاها المخاض الى جذع النخله) وفي سنه 330 م بنت هيلانه ام قسطنطين الكبير، كنيسه فوق المغاره التي قيل ان يسوع ولد فيها، وهي اليوم اقدم كنيسه في العالم. والمغاره تقع داخل كنيسه الميلاد، ومنحوته في صخر كلسي، وتحتوي على غرفتين صغيرتين، وفي الشماليه منها بلاطه رخاميه، منزل منها نجمه فضيه، حيث يقال ان يسوع ولد هناك. وعندما دخل عمر بن الخطاب القدس، توجه الى بيت لحم، وفيها اعطى سكانها امانًا خطيًا على ارواحهم واولادهم وممتلكاتهم وكنائسهم. ولما حان وقت الصلاه، صلى باشاره من راهب، امام الحنيه الجنوبيه للكنيسه، التي اخذ المسلمون يقيمون فيها صلواتهم، فرادى، وجعل الخليفه على النصارى اسراجها وتنظيفها. وهكذا صار المسلمون والمسيحيون يقيمون صلواتهم جنباً الى جنب.\nتذكر بيت لحم في العهد الجديد باعتبارها مكان ميلاد يسوع: «ولما ولد يسوع في بيت لحم اليهوديه» (مت 2: 1 5، لو 2: 4 15)، ونتيجه لذلك حدثت مذبحه الاطفال الابرياء بامر هيرودس الملك (مت 2: 8 و16). وحيث ان هادريان قد جرب بيت لحم تماما، واقام في موضعها نصبا مقدسا للاله «ادونيس»، فلابد ان تكريم تلك المدينه باعتبارها مكان ميلاد يسوع، يرجع الي ما قبل عصر هادريان (132 م). وقد اقام قسطنطين الملك (حوالي 330 م) كنيسه على الطراز الروماني فوق موقع كهف المذود الذي شهد مولد يسوع. وتعتبر هذه الكنيسه حتى اليوم اهم مقصد للسياح، في المدينه. وهي لم يطرا عليها تغيير كبير، رغم ان جستنيان قد وسع فيها وزينها، ورغم ما تعرضت له من تهدم وترميم.\n\nالحكم العربي الاسلامي\nفي سنه 648 م دخلت المدينه تحت الحكم الاسلامي، وزارها الخليفه عمر بن الخطاب الذي لم يصلّ داخل كنيسه المهد، خوفاً من ان تحدث نزاعات في المستقبل على الكنيسه بين المسلمين والمسيحيين حيث صلى بجانبها. وكانت المدينه قد اُلحقت بجند فلسطين التابع لولايه الشام بعد ان تم فتح جميع اراضي بلاد الشام على يد عدد من القاده منهم عمرو بن العاص وابو عبيده بن الجراح.\nيشار الى انه تم بناء مسجد في بيت لحم عام 1860 وهو مسجد عمر نسبه للخليفه عمر بن الخطاب، والذي تم ترميمه حتى العام 1954 تحت الاداره الاردنيه للمدينه. وكانت الارض التي تم بناء المسجد عليها تم التبرع بها من قبل الكنيسه الارثوذكسيه اليونانيه.\nوقد عاش ابناء الديانتين المسيحيه والاسلاميه في هذه المدينه بروح من الاخاء والتعاون وتمارس كل فيهما شعائرها الدينيه ونشاطاتها الاقتصاديه الاجتماعيه على الرغم من ان المدينه تعرضت لفترات من المد والجزر حسب الحكم القائم، ومن اكثر العهود ازدهارًا بالنسبه لبيت لحم هو زمن هارون الرشيد 786-809 م والدوله الفاطميه 952-1094 م، حيث راجت التجاره وتيسرت الحريه والامن ورممت الكنائس واماكن العباده.\n\nالحروب الصليبيه\nفي 1099 دخلت المدينه تحت الحكم الصليبي بعد ان دخلها الجيش الصليبي بقياده تانكرد فدمر المدينه واحرقها ولم يتبق منها الا كنيسه المهد. لم يكتف الصليبيون بما حازوا عليه، فقاموا بتوسيع حدود المملكه، ومع اواخر يوليو 1099 غزوا شمال فلسطين، ثم وصل جيش الفاطميين في 12 اغسطس فالتقى وجيش المملكه الوليده في عسقلان، واحرز الصليبيون نصرًا هامًا ضمن لهم السيطره على الساحل الفلسطيني؛ وقد دار خلاف بين امراء المملكه حول طبيعه الدوله بين كونها دوله دينيه يحكمها اسقفها ديبامرت مبعوث البابا، او دوله مدنيه يحكمها جودفري، واتفق اخيرًا على كونها دوله مدنيه وذلك بمباركه ديبامبرت مبعوث البابا الى المملكه، رغم ان طموحه هذا عاد للظهور بعد وفاه جودفري. عام 1100 توفي جودفري بنتيجه المرض، وخلفه شقيقه بالدوين الاول المتحدر من بولونيا وقد انتخب في 11 نوفمبر وتمّ التتويج في بيت لحم يوم 25 ديسمبر 1100 وهو يوم عيد الميلاد، بعد تنافس مع تانكرد والاسقف ديامبرت حول وراثه العرش، وقد تم ارضاء تانكرد بمنحه اماره انطاكيه بعد اسر اميرها في حلب. اما بالدوين فكان اول من خلع عليه لقب «ملك المملكه اللاتينيه في القدس»، ما شكل ترسيخًا لهويه الدوله الجديده، وقد قسمت الدوله الى اربع مطرانيات وابرشيات عديده تحت سلطه بطريرك القدس.\nوقد دام الحكم الصليبي لبيت لحم حتى عام 1187 حيث عادت لاصحابها بعد انتصار المسلمين بقياده صلاح الدين الايوبي على الصليبين في معركه حطين. وفي عام 1229 عادت مدينه بيت لحم لحكم الصليبين بموجب الاتفاقيه التي وقعت بين ممثلي الخليفه الكامل فخر الدين وامير اربيل صلاح الدين وممثلي الامبراطور فريدريك. لكنهم فقدوها نهائيا بعد عده سنين فقط.\n\nالعهد المملوكي والعثماني\nفي عام 1244 تمكن المسلمون بقياده نجم الدين من استعاده المدينه بشكل نهائي، قام بعدها الظاهر بيبرس بدخول المدينه عام 1263 ودمرا ابراجها وهدم اسوارها، وفي عام 1517 دخلت المدينه تحت الحكم العثماني، وبعد تطور وسائل النقل والمواصلات تحولت المدينه الى مركز جذب هام للحجاج القادمين من اوروبا وانعكست اثاره على الاوضاع في المدينه وازدهرت صناعه الصوف والخزف وغيرها الا ان سوء الاوضاع الاقتصاديه دفع بالكثير من ابناء المدينه الى الهجره خارجها.\nفي القرن التاسع عشر - ومع بدايه القرن الماضي اخذت المدينه بالنمو خاصه على ايدي المسيحيين الذين كانوا يشكلون الاكثريه العظمى. في عام 1831، عندما احتل محمد علي باشا مصر المدينه، طرد المسلمون المسيحيين وامر الباشا بهدم حيّهم. وبعد عشره ايام اعاد الاتراك بناءه.\nمن 1831 الى 1841، كانت فلسطين تحت حكم اسره محمد علي من مصر. خلال هذه الفتره، عانت المدينه من الزلازل الذي ضربها، فضلًا عن تدمير القوات المصريه لحي مسلم في عام 1834، على ما يبدو انتقامًا لمقتل احد الموالين لرعايه ابراهيم باشا. في عام 1841، اصبحت بيت لحم تحت سيطره الحكم العثماني مره اخرى وظلت كذلك حتى نهايه الحرب العالميه الاولى. في العهد العثماني، من المشاكل التي واجهتها سكان بيت لحم البطاله والخدمه العسكريه الاجباريه والضرائب الثقيله، مما ادى الى هجره جماعيه خاصه الى اميركا الجنوبيه.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عام 1917، سقطت بيت لحم بيد الجيش الانجليزي، ودخلت المدينه مع باقي مدن فلسطين مظله الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين عام 1920، واصبحت جزءا من فلسطين في فتره الانتداب البريطاني وتم اضافتها الى المنطقه المدوّله عندما اصدرت الامم المتحده قرار تقسيم فلسطين الى دولتين عربيه ويهوديه عام 1947، ولكن قام الاردن بضمها مع سائر مناطق الضفه الغربيه عام 1951. وبقيت تحت الحكم الاردني حتى حرب 1967.\nارتفعت درجه بيت لحم الاداريه بعد ان كانت (ناحيه) في العهد العثماني الى (قضاء) في العهد البريطاني، يقع بين اقضيه القدس والخليل واريحا. وبقي كذلك لعام 1944 م حيث الغي هو وقضاء اريحا والحقا بقضاء القدس. فكان ذلك اخر تغيير اداري قامت به الحكومه البريطانيه في فلسطين.\nقرار التقسيم\n\nقامت هيئه الامم المتحده عام 1947 بمحاوله لايجاد حل الصراع العربي الاسرائيلي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئه الامم بتشكيل لجنه UNSCOP المتالّفه من دول متعدّده باستثناء الدّول دائمه العضويه لضمان الحياد في عمليه ايجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنه بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الاول باقامه دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينه القدس من قِبل اداره دوليه. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تاسيس فيدراليه تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهوديه والعربيه. ومال معظم افراد لجنه UNSCOP تجاه المشروع الاول والرامي لتاسيس دولتين مستقلّتين باطار اقتصدي موحد. وقامت هيئه الامم بقبول مشروع لجنه UNSCOP الدّاعي للتقسيم مع اجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركه بين الدولتين، العربيه واليهوديه، على ان يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nاعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من ارض فلسطين للدوله اليهوديه، وشملت حصّه اليهود من ارض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من اسدود الى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينه يافا) واغلبيه مساحه صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينه بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصريه). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحه للزراعه ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الارض الفلسطينيه على اماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهوديه بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدوله اليهوديه. وكان نصيب بيت لحم ان يتم الحاقها بالمنطقه المدوله مع القدس.\n\nالحكم الاردني\nومع باقي الضفه الغربيه دخلت المدينه في عام 1951 في اتحاد مع المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه، واصبحت في عام 1964 مركزاً لمحافظه بيت لحم. وبقيت تحت الحكم الاردني حتى احتلالها في حرب 1967 او النكسه.\n\nالنكسه\nسقطت المدينه في يد اسرائيل بعد عام 1967، لتظل تحت الاحتلال لمده 27 سنه وتعاني من الاهمال الاسرائيلي لها كباقي المدن العربيه الفلسطينيه المحتله. وقد صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات شائعه من اراضي بيت لحم واقامت عليها العديد من المستوطنات.\nفي عام 1987، انخرط سكان مدينه بيت لحم بوقت مبكر في الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الاولى. وكانت القياده الوطنيه الموحده للانتفاضه، تقوم بتوزيع النشرات الاسبوعيه في شوارع بيت لحم مع جدول زمني للاضراب المتصاحب مع الاحتجاجات اليوميه ضد الدوريات الاسرائيليه في المدينه. وفي المظاهرات، تم احراق الاطارات في الشوارع، كما القى الحشود الحجاره والزجاجات الحارقه على جنود الاحتلال. ورد الجيش الاسرائيلي بالغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي. واغلقت المدارس في مدينه بيت لحم قسرا، وفتحت تدريجيا لبضع ساعات. ونفذت الاعتقالات خارج البيوت، وفرض حظر التجول ومنع السفر، ما اعتبره الفلسطينيون بانه عقاب جماعي. ردا على اغلاق المدارس، وتنظيم دورات تعليم سكان المنزل لمساعده الطلاب على استدراك الماده الفائته، وهذا اصبح واحدا من الرموز القليله من العصيان المدني.\n\nالسلطه الفلسطينيه\nفي 21 ديسمبر 1995، انسحبت القوات الاسرائيليه من بيت لحم، وبعد ثلاثه ايام اصبحت المدينه تحت اداره السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه وسيطرتُها العسكريه الكامله بناءً على الاتفاق الانتقالي بشان الضفه الغربيه وقطاع غزه في عام 1995. واصبحت المدينه مُنذ ذلك الحين، مركزاً لمحافظه بيت لحم، كما وقعت معظم اراضي المحافظه ضمن تصنيف (ا) و (ب) حسب اتفاق اوسلو.\nخلال الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه، في 2000-2001، تضررت بشده البنيه التحتيه في بيت لحم والسياحه. وفي عام 2002، كانت المدينه منطقه القتال الرئيسيه في عمليه الدرع الواقي، عمليه عسكريه كبرى من جانب الجيش الاسرائيلي.\nخلال العمليه، قام الجيش الاسرائيلي بمُحاصره كنيسه المهد، حيث كان حوالي 200 مسلح فلسطيني لجاوا الى الكنيسه. واستمر الحصار لمده 39 يومًا وقتلوا تسعه من المسلحين ورجل كنيسي. انتهى الحصار باتفاق على نفي 13 من المسلحين المطلوبين الى دول اوروبيه مختلفه وموريتانيا.\n\nالاهميه الدينيه\nلبيت لحم اهميه عظيمه لدى المسيحيين لكونها مسقط راس يسوع (عيسى). في بيت لحم العديد من الكنائس، ولعل اهمها كنيسه المهد، التي بنيت على يد قسطنطين الاكبر (330 م). وذلك فوق كهف او مغاره، والتي يعتقد انها الاسطبل الذي ولد فيه يسوع. يعتقد ان هذه الكنيسه هي اقدم الكنائس الموجوده في العالم. كما ان هناك سرداب اخر قريب يعتقد ان جيروم قد قضى ثلاثين عاما من حياته فيه يترجم الكتاب المقدس.\n\nيفهم من هذا النص ان يوسف ومريم لم يجدا لهما مكانا في منزل كمهام المعروف في بيت لحم فنزلا في مغاره تاوي اليها البهائم ويروي متى الانجيلي انه بعد ولاده يسوع، قام بعض المجوس من الشرق بزياره هيرودس للاستعلام عن مكان «الشخص الذي ولد ملكا لليهود»، لانهم راوا نجمه في الشرق. كان هيرودس، ملك اليهود، قلقًا من احتمال ان يفقد عرشه. قام هيرودس بتجميع رؤساء الكهنه وكتّاب الشعب وسالهم اين وُلد «الممسوح» (المسيح، باليونانيه: Ὁ Χριστός، هو كريستوس). اجابوا: في بيت لحم، حيث تنبا ميخا قبل سبعمئه وخمسين عاما عن قدومه «وانت يا بيت لحم ارض يهوذا لست الصغرى بین روساء يهوذا لان منك يخرج مدبر يرعی شعبي اسرائيل». ارسل هيرودس المجوس الى بيت لحم، وامرهم بالبحث عن الطفل، وبعد ان يعثروا عليه، «ان يخبروه عنه، حتى يذهب هو ايضاً ليعبده». وقدم المجوس الى بيت لحم وقدّموا للمولود هدايا من ذهب ولبان ومر. وانصرفوا من طريق اخر مارین بحقل الرعاه شرقا كي لا يقابلوا هيرودس الذي ظنوا فيه شرا بعد ان تم تحذيرهم في حلم بعدم ابلاغ هيرودس. وبالمثل، تم تحذير يوسف في حلم ان هيرودس كان يعتزم قتل يسوع، لذلك فر هو وعائلته الى مصر. عندما ادرك هيرودس انه قد خدع، اصدر اوامر بقتل جميع الاولاد الذين تقل اعمارهم عن سنتين في بيت لحم والمناطق المجاوره لها من ابن عامين فما دون لعله يقتل الطفل المولود بينهم. بقي يوسف وعائلته في مصر حتى وفاه هيرودس، ثم انتقلوا الى الناصره في الجليل لتجنب العيش تحت حكم ارخيلاوس ابن هيرودس.\nتُذكر روايه الميلاد في انجيلي متى ولوقا، وتغدوا الروايه في انجيل لوقا اكثر تفصيلاً؛ عناصر الروايه الانجيليه للميلاد مفادها ان مريم قد ظهر لها جبرائيل مرسلاً من قبل الله واخبرها انها ستحبل بقوّه الروح القدس بطفل «يكون عظيمًا وابن العلي يدعى، ولن يكون لملكه نهايه»،لوقا 1/32] وعندما اضطرب يوسف النجار خطيب مريم من روايتها ظهر له الملاك ايضًا في الحلم تصديقًا لروايه مريم وتشجيعًا له، ويتفق متى ولوقا ان الميلاد قد تمّ في بيت لحم مدينه النبي داود لا في مدينه الناصره حيث كانا يعيشان وحيث تمت البشاره، يعود ذلك تتميمًا للنبؤات السابقه حول مكان الميلاد سيّما نبؤه النبي ميخا، اما السبب المباشر فهو طلب اغسطس قيصر احصاء سكان الامبراطوريه الرومانيه تمهيدًا لدفع الضرائب، ولذلك سافر يوسف مع مريم وكان حينها قد ضمها الى بيته كزوجته دون ان تنشا بينهما علاقه زوجيه، وعند وصولهما الى بيت لحم لم يجدا مكانًا للاقامه في فندق او نزل وحان وقت وضع مريم، فبحسب انجيل لوقا وضعت طفلها في مذود ولفته بقماط.لوقا 2/7] وان ذكر المذود هو الدافع الاساسي للاعتقاد بوجود المغاره او الحظيره، لان الحظائر عاده كانت عباره عن كهوف اما المذود فهو مكان وضع علف الحيوانات، وكان اوريجانوس قد اثبت المغاره وقال انه نقل القصه عن تقاليد اقدم.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع بيت لحم 31°43′0″N 35°12′0″E وعلى ارتفاع حوالي 775 متر (2,543 قدم) فوق مستوى سطح البحر، 30 مترا (98 قدم) اعلى من القدس. بيت لحم وتقع في الجزء الجنوبي من جبال الخليل.\nتقع المدينه على بعد 10 كيلومترات (6.2 ميل) الى الجنوب من القدس، 73 كيلومترًا (45 ميل) شمال شرق قطاع غزه والبحر المتوسط، و 75 كيلومترًا (47 ميل) الى الغرب من عمان عاصمه الاردن، و 59 كيلومترًا (37 ميل) الى الجنوب الشرقي من تل ابيب وعلى بعد 10 كيلومترات (6.2 ميل) الى الجنوب من القدس.\n\nمن المدن والبلدات القريبه تشمل بيت صفافا والقدس في الشمال، وبيت جالا الى الشمال الغربي، حوسان الى الغرب، الخضر وارطاس الى الجنوب الغربي، وبيت ساحور الى الشرق. وتقع بيت جالا، وبيت ساحور تُشكل تجمع مع بيت لحم وتقع مخيمات اللاجئين عايده ومخيم بيت جبرين داخل حدود المدينه.\nتقع البلده القديمه في وسط المدينه، وتتالف من ثمانيه ارباع سكنيه (احياء)، المبنيه باسلوب الفسيفساء التي تشكل المنطقه المحيطه ساحه كنيسه المهد. الارباع تضمُ المسيحيين وربع واحد فقط يضمُ مسلمين. سُميت معظم الاحياء المسيحيه حسب اسماء عشائر الغساسنه العربيه التي استقرت هُناك. وشكل المغتربين العرب المسيحيين حي القواوسه الذين اتوا من تقوع في القرن الثامن عشر. هُناك ايضًا ربع السريانيه يقع خارج البلده القديمه، تعود اصول سكانها من مديات وماسارتي «وMa'asarte» في تركيا. يبلغ عدد سُكان البلده القديمه 5,000 نسمه.\n\nالتقسيم الاداري\nمناطق المدينه\nتعتبر البلده القديمه في بيت لحم اهم مناطقها على الاطلاق لوجود اهم المعالم الدينيه المسيحيه فيها، وهي تتوسط المدينه وشوارعها. من اهم تلك الشوارع: طريق الخليل، الشارع الجديد، شارع بيت ساحور، شارع بولس السادس، شارع السينما، شارع الفرير، شارع جمال عبد الناصر.\nالمخيمات\n\nتضم منطقه بيت لحم ثلاثه مخيمات رئيسيه هي مخيم عايده، مخيم بيت جبرين، ومخيم الدهيشه. ومثلها مثل باقي مخيمات الضفه الغربيه، فقد تاسست فوق قطعه من الارض استاجرتها الاونروا من الحكومه الاردنيه.\n\nمخيم عايده: تاسس عام 1950 بين مدينتي بيت لحم وبيت جالا. ويمتد فوق مساحه من الارض تبلغ 0,71 كيلومتر مربع لم تنم بشكل كاف مع نمو مجتمع اللاجئين. ولذلك، فان المخيم يعاني من مشاكل اكتظاظ شديده.\nمخيم بيت جبرين: تاسس عام 1950 في قلب مدينه بيت لحم. وهو يعد اصغر مخيم للاجئين في الضفه الغربيه حيث تبلغ مساحته 0.02 كيلومتر مربع فقط. وغالبا ما يطلق على المخيم ايضا اسم مخيم عزه.\nمخيم الدهيشه: تاسس عام 1949 فوق مساحه من الارض تبلغ 0.31 كيلومتر مربع ضمن حدود بلديه بيت لحم.\n\nالمناخ\nيسود في بيت لحم مناخ متوسطي معتدل، ذو صيف حار وجاف، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يحل فصل الربيع في اواخر شهر مارس (اذار) واوائل ابريل (نيسان)، ويعتبر شهرا يوليو (تموز) واغسطس (اب) احرّ شهور السنه، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحراره فيهما الى 28.9 ° مئويه (84 ° فهرنهايت)، اما اكثر الاشهر بروده فهو يناير (كانون الثاني)، ويصل فيه معدل درجه الحراره الى 3.9 ° مئويه (39 ° فهرنهايت).\nاما بالنسبه لمعدلات الامطار فتكون معدومه في بعض الاشهر مثل يونيو ويوليو واغسطس. بينما يتساقط بين شهريّ اكتوبر (تشرين الاول) وابريل (نيسان) عادهً، ويبلغ معدل المتساقطات السنوي 589 مليمتراً (23.2 انش)، وتكون في اعلى معدلاتها في شهري يناير وفبراير حيث يمكن ان يصل مستواها الى اكثر من 170 ميليمتر.\n\nالسكان\nوفقًا لسجلات الضرائب العثمانيه، شكل المسيحيون نسبه 60% من السكان في القرن السادس عشر، وفي منتصف القرن 16 اصبحت اعداد المسلمين والمسيحيين متساويه. لم يكن هناك مسلمون في نهايه القرن، وبلغ عدد سكانها 287 (سجل الذكور البالغين دافعي الضرائب). وطلب انذاك من المسيحيين وغير المسلمين دفع ضريبه الجزيه في جميع انحاء الدوله العثمانيه. في عام 1867، وصف زائر امريكي المدينه الذي بلغ عدد سكانها 3,000 الى 4,000 منهم 100 يتبعون البروتستانتيه و 300 من المسلمين و«ما تبقى ينتمون الى الكنائس اللاتينيه واليونانيه مع نسبه قليله من الارمن»  ووفقًا لتقرير اخر من نفس العام بلغ عدد السكان المسيحيين 3000، وبالاضافه الى 50 من المسلمين.\nفي عام 1948، شكلت المسيحيه نسبه 85% من التركيبه السُكانيه للمدينه معظمها من الطوائف اليونانيه الارثوذكسيه والكاثوليكيه، اما نسبه المسلمين بلغت 13% مسلم سني.\nوفقًا للاحصائيات الاسرائيليه عام 1967، بلغ عدد سكان بيت لحم 14,439 نسمه منهم 7,790 نسمه مسلمين ما نسبته 53,9% بينما بلغ عدد المسيحيين 6,231 نسمه ما يعادل 46,1% من سكان بيت لحم.\nوفقًا لتعداد الجهاز المركزي للاحصاء عام 1997، فقد بلغ عدد سكان المدينه 21,670 نسمه، بما في ذلك 6,570 لاجئ وهو ما يمثل 30.3% من سكان المدينه. وفي عام 1997، اما التوزيع العمري السكاني لفترات عُمريه مختلفه كالتالي: 27,4% تحت سن عشره سنوات و 20% 10-19 سنه و 17.3% 20-29 سنه، 17.7% 30-44 سنه و 12.1% 45-64 سنه و 5.3% فوق سن 65 عامًا. بلغ عدد الذكور 11,079 اما عدد الاناث 10,594.\nوفقا لتقديرات الجهاز المركزي للاحصاء، بلغ عدد سكان بيت لحم 29,930 نسمه في مُنتصف عام 2006. ومع ذلك، في تعداد 2007 كشف عن وجود 25,266 نسمه منهم 12,753 ذكورًا و 12,513 من الاناث. و 6,709 وحده سكنيه منها 5,211 كانت للاُسر. اما مُتوسط عدد افراد الاسر 4,8.\nبحلول عام 2005، كانت نسبه السكان المسيحيين تراجعت بشكل كبير، الى حوالي 40% من 50%. المسجد الوحيد في المدينه القديمه هو مسجد عمر، ويقع في ساحه كنيسه المهد.\n\nالدين\nيدعى الكثير من سكان بيت لحم المسيحيين انهم ينحدرون من العشائر المسيحيه العربيه التي قدمت من شبه الجزيره العربيه، اكبر هذه العشائر في المدينه: الفراحيه ونجاجره. العشائر السابقه الذكر قد تنحدرُ من الغساسنه الذين هاجروا من اليمن الى منطقه وادي موسى في الوقت الحاضر الاردن في حين ان النجاجره تنحدر من العرب في نجران في جنوب الحجاز. عشيره عريقه اخرى في المدينه هي عناتره وتنحدر اصولهم من شبه الجزيره العربيه.\n\nانخفضت اعداد المسيحيين في المدينه بشكل مُطرد، ويرجع ذلك في المقام الاول الى الهجره. انخفاض معدل مواليد المسيحيين يمثل ايضًا سببًا للانخفاض. في عام 1947، بلغت نسبه المسيحيين حوالي 85%، ولكن بحلول عام 1998 انخفضت النسبه الى 40%. في عام 2005، وضح رئيس بلديه بيت لحم فيكتور بطارسه ان \"نتيجه للتوتر سواء الجسدي او النفسي والحاله الاقتصاديه السيئه، كثير من الناس يهاجرون، سواء مسيحيين او مسلمين، لكن الهجره اكثر انتشارًا بين المسيحيين، لانهم بالفعل هم اقليه.\nادت اندلاع الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه الى انخفاض ناتج القطاع السياحي والتي اثرت على الاقليه المسيحيه وعلى اصحاب الفنادق في بيت لحم الذين يقدمون خدمات المُلبيه لاحتياجات السياج الاجانب. اشير تحليل احصائي لهجره المسيحيين من المدينه لانعدام الفرص الاقتصاديه والتعليميه، خصوصًا الطبقه الوسطى والمتعلمه منهم. مُنذ اندلاع الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه، غادر 10% من السكان المسيحيين المدينه.\nذكرت الصحيفه الاسرائيليه جيروزليم بوست ان «تقلص اعداد الطوائف المسيحيه الفلسطينيه في الاراضي المقدسه وبشكل خاص في بيت لحم جاء كنتيجه مباشره بسبب انتمائها الى الطبقه المتوسطه والعليا». يذكر ان المسيحيين لديهم صوره عامه كنخبه متعلمه وذات امتيازات طبقيه، وكذلك عدم لجوئهم الى العنف، مما يجعلهم اكثر عرضه للتعرض لاعمال عنف. يُذكر ان بسبب الهجره المسيحيه يتواجد غالبيه مسيحيين بيت لحم خارج العالم العربي بشكل خاص في امريكا اللاتينيه التي تضم نصف مليون فلسطيني في امريكا اللاتينيه والوسطى حيث ان 80 الى 85% منهم هم من المسيحيين الفلسطينيين. وتضم التشيلي اكبر جاليه فلسطينيه مسيحيه في العالم خارج منطقه فلسطين حيث يصل اعدادهم الى 350,000 وتعود اصول غالبيتهم الى بيت لحم وبيت جالا وبيت ساحور ويعتبرون من الاقليات الناجحه جدًا فغالبيتهم ينتمون الى الطبقه العليا والوسطى ومن المتعلمون كما وقد برز عدد منهم في السياسه والاقتصاد والثقافه.\nفي عام 2006، ووفقًا للاستطلاع الذي اجراهُ المركز الفلسطيني للبحوث والحوار الثقافي في المدينه ان 90% من المسيحيين قالوا ان لديهم اصدقاء مسلمين، ووافق 73,3% منهم على ان السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه تُعامل التراث المسيحي في المدينه باحترام ونسب 78% منهم سبب هجره المسيحيين الى القيود الاسرائيليه التي تفرُضها على السفر.\nان مدينه بيت لحم هي من اقدس المواقع المسيحيه في العالم كونها المدينه التي فيها وُلِدَ يسوع المسيح، وبسبب قدسيه مدينه بيت لحم لدى العالم المسيحي تتواجد في المدينه عدد كبير من الكنائس والاديره فضلًا عن المواقع المسيحيه المقدسه، بالاضافه الى المؤسسات المسيحيّه المختلفه من مدراس وجامعه كاثوليكيه ومستشفيات شتى، وكونها مدينه ميلاد يسوع تُحظى المدينه بشعبيه واسعه وترتبط بعيد الميلاد. كانت كنيسه المهد هي الاولى بين الكنائس الثلاث التي بناها الامبراطور قسطنطين في مطلع القرن الرابع الميلادي حين اصبحت المسيحيه ديانه الدوله الرسميه وكان ذلك استجابه لطلب الاسقف ماكاريوس في المجمع المسكوني الاول في نيقيه عام 325 للميلاد. دخلت كنيسه المهد سنه 2012 قائمه مواقع التراث العالمي، كنيسه المهد هي اول موقع فلسطيني يدرج ضمن لائحه التراث العالمي لمنظمه اليونيسكو. الجدول

          "summary": "بَيْت لَحم (بالسريانية: ܒܝܬ ܠܚܡ؛ باليونانية: Βηθλεὲμ؛ باللاتينية: Bethleem) هي مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة بيت لحم. تقع في الضفة الغربية التابعة للسلطة الفلسطينية على بعد 10 كم إلى الجنوب من القدس. يبلغ عدد سكانها 30,000 نسمة بدون سكان مخيمات اللاجئين. وتعتبر مركزاً للثقافة والسياحة في فلسطين.\nللمدينة أهمية عظيمة لدى المسيحيين لكونها مسقط رأس يسوع (عيسى). تضم بيت لحم العديد من الكنائس، ولعل أهمها كنيسة المهد، التي بنيت على يد قسطنطين الأكبر (330 م). وقد بنيت الكنيسة فوق كهف أو مغارة يعتقد أنها مذود البقر الذي ولد فيه يسوع. ويعتقد أن هذه الكنيسة هي أقدم الكنائس الموجودة في العالم. كما أن هناك سرداباً آخر قريب يعتقد أن جيروم قضى فيه ثلاثين عاماً من حياته يترجم الكتاب المقدس.\nبنيت المدينة وفقًا لعلماء الآثار على يد الكنعانيين في الألف الثاني قبل الميلاد، وعُرفت بعدد من الأسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسمها في مصادر قدماء السريان والآراميين. وقد مرَّ على المدينة عدد من الغزاة عبر التاريخ، حيث تعرّضت بيت لحم هي وبقية فلسطين للفتح الأشوري والبابلي والفارسي والإغريقي والروماني والبيزنطي. وأُعيد بناؤها من قبل الإمبراطور البيزنطي جستنيان الأول. وفتحها العرب المسلمون على يد عمر بن الخطاب عام 637م. وفي عام 1099م، احتلها الصليبيون الذين حصنوها واستبدلوا فيها الأرثوذكسية اليونانية برجال الدين اللاتين. وقد طُرد هؤلاء رجال الدين اللاتين بعد أن فتح المدينة صلاح الدين الأيوبي. ومع مجيء المماليك في عام 1250م، هُدمت جدران المدينة وأعيد بناؤها في وقت لاحق خلال حكم الإمبراطورية العثمانية. في عام 1917 انتزعت بريطانيا السيطرة على المدينة من العثمانيين خلال الحرب العالمية الأولى وكان من المفترض أن تُضمّن في المنطقة الدولية في إطار خطة الأمم المتحدة لتقسيم فلسطين عام 1947. وأُلحقت المدينة بالأردن بعد نكبة فلسطين عام 1948. وقد احتلتها إسرائيل في عام 1967 بحرب الأيام الستة. ومنذ عام 1995، ووفقاً لاتفاقية أوسلو، نُقلت السلطات المدنية والأمنية في المدينة إلى يد السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية.\nتقع بيت لحم ضمن سلسلة جبال القدس، وترتفع عن سطح البحر 775 متراً. وتعتبر المدينة تاريخياً منطقة مسيحية السكان، إلا أن معظم سكانها اليوم هم من المسلمين، ولكنها لا زالت موطناً لواحد من أكبر المجتمعات المسيحية الفلسطينية.\nلبيت لحم دور رئيس في القطاع الاقتصادي الفلسطيني من خلال السياحة التي تزداد أثناء موسم عيد الميلاد عندما يحتشد الحجاج المسيحيون إلى كنيسة المهد، حيث يوجد في بيت لحم أكثر من 30 فندقاً و 300 ورشة عمل للحرف اليدوية. ويسكن هذه المدينة أحد أقدم المجتمعات المسيحية في العالم على الرغم من تقلص حجمه بسبب الهجرة. اختيرت المدينة عاصمة الثقافة العربية للعام 2020. وسجّلت مدينة بيت لحم أول إصابات بفايروس كورونا التاجي «كوفيد-19» لتصبح أول مدينة تغلق في فلسطين لمدة زادت عن 70 يوماً.",

          "content": "Jericho ( JERR-ik-oh; Arabic: أريحا, romanized: Arīḥā, IPA: [ʔaˈriːħaː] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Jericho Governorate. The city is located in the Jordan Valley, with the Jordan River to the east and Jerusalem to the west.\nJericho is among the oldest cities in the world. Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of more than 20 successive settlements in Jericho, the first of which dates back 11,000 years (to 9000 BCE), almost to the very beginning of the Holocene epoch of the Earth's history. Copious springs in and around the city have attracted human habitation for thousands of years. Jericho is described in the Bible as the \"city of palm trees\".\nFollowing the era of Mandatory Palestine, the West Bank was annexed and ruled by Jordan starting in 1950, then was occupied by Israel in 1967. Administrative control of Jericho was handed over to the Palestinian Authority in 1994.\nThe city had a population of 20,907 in 2017. In 2023, the archaeological site in the center of the city, known as Tell es-Sultan / Old Jericho, was inscribed in UNESCO's list as a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine, and described as the \"oldest fortified city in the world\".\n\nEtymology\nJericho's name in Biblical Hebrew, Yəriḥo (יְרִיחוֹ) is generally thought to derive from the Canaanite word rēḥ 'fragrant', but other theories hold that it originates in the Canaanite word Yaraḥ 'moon' or the name of the lunar deity Yarikh, for whom the city was an early centre of worship.\nJericho's Arabic name, Arīḥā, means 'fragrant' and also has its roots in Canaanite rēḥ.\n\nHistory and archaeology\nThe first excavations of the site were carried out by Charles Warren in 1868. Ernst Sellin and Carl Watzinger excavated Tell es-Sultan and Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq between 1907 and 1909, and in 1911, and John Garstang excavated between 1930 and 1936. Kathleen Kenyon worked there between 1952 and 1958.\nSubsequently, Lorenzo Nigro and Nicolò Marchetti excavated in 1997–2000. Since 2009, the Italian-Palestinian archaeological project of excavation and restoration was resumed by Rome (\"La Sapienza\" University and Palestinian MOTA-DACH) under the direction of Nigro, Hamdan Taha, and Jehad Yasine since 2015. The Italian-Palestinian Expedition carried out 13 seasons in 20 years (1997–2017), with some major discoveries, like Tower A1 in the Middle Bronze Age southern Lower Town and Palace G on the eastern flanks of the Spring Hill overlooking the Spring of 'Ain es-Sultan dating from Early Bronze III.\n\nStone Age: Tell es-Sultan and spring\nThe earliest excavated settlement was located at the present-day Tell es-Sultan (or Sultan's Hill), a couple of kilometers from the current city. In both Arabic and Hebrew, tell means \"mound\"; consecutive layers of habitation built up a mound over time, as is common for ancient settlements in the Middle East and Anatolia. Jericho is the type site for the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) periods.\n\nNatufian hunter-gatherers, c. 10,000 BCE\nEpipaleolithic construction at the site appears to predate the invention of agriculture, with the construction of Natufian culture structures beginning earlier than 9000 BCE, the beginning of the Holocene epoch in geologic history.\nJericho has evidence of settlement dating back to c. 10,000 BCE. During the Younger Dryas period of cold and drought, permanent habitation of any one location was impossible. However, the Ein es-Sultan spring at what would become Jericho was a popular camping ground for Natufian hunter-gatherer groups, who left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind them. Around 9600 BCE, the droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas stadial had come to an end, making it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic, c. 9500–6500 BCE\nThe Pre-Pottery Neolithic eras at Jericho are divided into PPNA and PPNB.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA)\nThe first permanent settlement on the site of Jericho developed near the Ein es-Sultan spring between 9,500 and 9000 BCE. As the world warmed up, a new culture based on agriculture and sedentary dwelling emerged, which archaeologists have termed PPNA. Its cultures lacked pottery, but featured the following:\n\nsmall circular dwellings\nburial of the dead under the floor of buildings\nreliance on hunting of wild game\ncultivation of wild or domestic cereals\n\nAt Jericho, circular dwellings were built of clay and straw bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about 5 metres (16 ft) across and was roofed with mud-smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes.\n\nThe Pre-Sultan (c. 8350 – 7370 BCE) is sometimes called Sultanian. The site is a 40,000 m2 (430,000 sq ft) settlement surrounded by a massive stone wall over 3.6 m (12 ft) high and 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) wide at the base, inside of which stood a stone tower, over 8.5 metres (28 ft) high, containing an internal staircase with 22 stone steps and placed in the centre of the west side of the tell. This tower and the even older ones excavated at Tell Qaramel in Syria are the oldest towers ever to be discovered.\nThe wall and tower were built during the PPNA period around 8000 BCE. Carbon dates published in 1981 and 1983 indicate that the tower was built around 8300 BCE and stayed in use until c. 7800 BCE. The wall may have served as a defence against flood water (possibly to prevent the erosion of agricultural soil), with the tower used for ceremonial purposes. The wall and tower would have taken a hundred men more than a hundred days to construct, suggesting some kind of social organization. The town contained round mud-brick houses, but no street planning. The identity and number of Jericho's inhabitants during the PPNA period is still under debate, with estimates as high as 2,000–3,000 and as low as 200–300. It is known that this population had domesticated emmer wheat, barley and pulses, and hunted wild animals.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB)\nThe PPNB was a period of about 1.4 millennia, from 7220 to 5850 BCE (though carbon-14-dates are few and early). The following are PPNB cultural features:\n\nExpanded range of domesticated plants\nPossible domestication of sheep\nApparent cult involving the preservation of human skulls, with facial features reconstructed using plaster, and eyes set with shells in some cases\n\nAfter a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase, there was a settlement hiatus of around five centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the tell. This second settlement, established in 6800 BCE, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten plastered human skulls, painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features. These represent either teraphim or the first example of portraiture in art history, and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.\nThe architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bonding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room (6.5 m × 4 m (21.3 ft × 13.1 ft) and 7 m × 3 m (23.0 ft × 9.8 ft)) with internal divisions; the rest are small, presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish terrazzo-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.\nKathleen Kenyon interpreted one building as a shrine. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fitted into this niche.\nThe dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A skull cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; cowries were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in Tell Ramad and Beisamoun as well.\nOther finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, burins, scrapers, a few tranchet axes, obsidian, and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also querns, hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, anthropomorphic and theriomorphic clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.\nIn the late 4th millennium BCE, Jericho was occupied during Neolithic 2 and the general character of the remains on the site link it culturally with Neolithic 2 (or PPNB) sites in the West Syrian and Middle Euphrates groups. This link is established by the presence of rectilinear mud-brick buildings and plaster floors that are characteristic of the age.\n\nChalcolithic\nA succession of settlements followed from 4500 BCE onward.\n\nEarly Bronze Age\nIn Early Bronze I, the stratigraphic layers are Sultan IIIA1 village (EB IA, c. 3500 – 3200 BCE) and Sultan IIIA2 rural town (proto-urban, EB IB, c. 3200 – 3000 BCE).\nIn Early Bronze II, the strategraphic layers are Sultan IIIB1 foritifed town (EB IIA, c. 3000-2850 BCE) and Sultan IIIB2 with added towers and bastions to the fortification (EB IIB, c.2850 – 2700 BCE).\nIn the Early Bronze IIIA (c. 2700 – 2500/2450 BCE; Sultan IIIC1), the settlement reached its largest extent around 2600 BCE.\nDuring Early Bronze IIIB (c. 2500/2450–2350 BCE; Sultan IIIC2) there was a Palace G on Spring Hill and city walls.\nIn Early Bronze IV, the strategraphic layers are Sultan IIID1 (EB IVA; 2300 – 2200 BCE) and Sultan IIID2 (EB IVB; 2200 – 2000 BCE).\n\nMiddle Bronze Age\nJericho was continually occupied into the Middle Bronze Age; it was destroyed in the Late Bronze Age, after which it no longer served as an urban centre. The city was surrounded by extensive defensive walls strengthened with rectangular towers, and possessed an extensive cemetery with vertical shaft-tombs and underground burial chambers; the elaborate funeral offerings in some of these may reflect the emergence of local kings.\nDuring the Middle Bronze Age, Jericho was a small prominent city of the Canaan region, reaching its greatest Bronze Age extent in the period from 1700 to 1550 BCE. It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the Maryannu, a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the Mitannite state to the north. Kathleen Kenyon reported \"the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna'an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period\" and there was \"a massive stone revetment ... part of a complex system\" of defenses. Bronze Age Jericho fell in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, the calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer dating to 1617–1530 BCE. Carbon dating c. 1573 BCE confirmed the accuracy of the stratigraphical dating c. 1550.\nChronology (Nigro 2016)\n\nMiddle Bronze IA, Tell es-Sultan IVa1 (c. 2000/1950-1900 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IB, Tell es-Sultan IVa2 (c. 1900-1800 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IIA, Tell es-Sultan IVb1 (c. 1800-1700 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IIB, Tell es-Sultan IVb2 (c. 1700-1650 BC)\nMiddle Bronze IIC/III, Tell es-Sultan IVc (c. 1650-1550 BC)\n\nLate Bronze Age\nDecades after the destruction of the Middle Bronze Age city, it recovered again on a smaller scale during the Late Bronze Age (1450–1200 BC), with the previous Middle Bronze city wall being refurbished by adding a mudbrick wall on top of its emerging crest. Excavations have found a structure known as the \"Middle Building\" which apparently served as the residence of the city's local rulers, then vassals of the Egyptian empire. Ultimately, the Middle Building was destroyed, although it was later reused in the early Iron Age. According to Nigro (2023), the Late Bronze IIB layers of the tell were heavily cut by levelling operations during the Iron Age, which explains the scarcity of 13th century BCE materials.\n\nHebrew Bible narrative\nThe Hebrew Bible tells the story of the Battle of Jericho led by Joshua, leading to the fall of the Canaanite city, the first one captured by the Israelites in the Promised Land. The historicity of biblical account is not generally accepted by scholars. Lorenzo Nigro suggests that the story might have developed from local memories of the destructions suffered by the Canaanite city in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE, which were later used by the biblical writers to create their narrative.\n\nIron Age\nOccupation in Tell es-Sultan appears to have resumed in the 11th century BCE, with the town becoming fortified again in the 10th century. Of this new city not much more remains than a four-room house on the eastern slope. By the 7th century, Jericho had become an extensive town, but this settlement was destroyed in the Babylonian conquest of Judah in the late 6th century.\n\nPersian and Early Hellenistic periods\nAfter the destruction of the Judahite city by the Babylonians in the late 6th century, whatever was rebuilt in the Persian period as part of the Restoration after the Babylonian captivity, left only very few remains. The tell was abandoned as a place of settlement not long after this period. During the Persian through Hellenistic periods, there is little in terms of occupation attested throughout the region.\nJericho went from being an administrative centre of Yehud Medinata (\"the Province of Judah\") under Persian rule to serving as the private estate of Alexander the Great between 336 and 323 BCE after his conquest of the region. In the middle of the 2nd century BCE Jericho was under Hellenistic rule of the Seleucid Empire, when the Syrian General Bacchides built a number of forts to strengthen the defences of the area around Jericho against the revolt by the Macabees. One of these forts, built at the entrance to Wadi Qelt, was later refortified by Herod the Great, who named it Kypros after his mother.\n\nHasmonean and Herodian periods\nAfter the abandonment of the Tell es-Sultan location, the new Jericho of the Late Hellenistic or Hasmonean and Early Roman or Herodian periods was established as a garden city in the vicinity of the royal estate at Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq and expanded greatly thanks to the intensive exploitation of the springs of the area. The new site consists of a group of low mounds on both banks of Wadi Qelt. The Hasmoneans were a dynasty descending from a priestly group (kohanim) from the tribe of Levi, who ruled over Judea following the success of the Maccabean Revolt until Roman influence over the region brought Herod to claim the Hasmonean throne.\nThe rock-cut tombs of a Herodian- and Hasmonean-era cemetery lie in the lowest part of the cliffs between Nuseib al-Aweishireh and Mount of Temptation. They date between 100 BCE and 68 CE.\n\nHerodian period\nHerod had to lease back the royal estate at Jericho from Cleopatra, after Mark Antony had given it to her as a gift. After their joint suicide in 30 BCE, Octavian assumed control of the Roman Empire and granted Herod absolute rule over Jericho, as part of the new Herodian domain. Herod's rule oversaw the construction of a hippodrome-theatre (Tell es-Samrat) to entertain his guests and new aqueducts to irrigate the area below the cliffs and reach his winter palaces built at the site of Tulul Abu el-Alaiq (also written ʾAlayiq). In 2008, the Israel Exploration Society published an illustrated volume of Herod's third Jericho palace.\nThe murder of Aristobulus III in a swimming pool at the Hasmonean royal winter palaces, as described by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, took place during a banquet organized by Herod's Hasmonean mother-in-law. After the construction of the palaces, the city had functioned not only as an agricultural center and as a crossroad, but also as a winter resort for Jerusalem's aristocracy.\nHerod was succeeded in Judea by his son, Herod Archelaus, who built a village in his name not far to the north, Archelaïs (modern Khirbet al-Beiyudat), to house workers for his date plantation.\nFirst-century Jericho is described in Strabo's Geography as follows:\n\nJericho is a plain surrounded by a kind of mountainous country, which in a way, slopes toward it like a theatre. Here is the Phoenicon, which is mixed also with all kinds of cultivated and fruitful trees, though it consists mostly of palm trees. It is 100 stadia in length and is everywhere watered with streams. Here also are the Palace and the Balsam Park.\n\nIn the New Testament\nThe Christian Gospels state that Jesus of Nazareth passed through Jericho where he healed blind beggars (Matthew 20:29), and inspired a local chief tax collector named Zacchaeus to repent of his dishonest practices (Luke 19:1–10). The road between Jerusalem and Jericho is the setting for the Parable of the Good Samaritan.\nJohn Wesley, in his New Testament Notes on this section of Luke's Gospel, claimed that \"about twelve thousand priests and Levites dwelt there, who all attended the service of the temple\".\nSmith's Bible Names Dictionary suggests that \"Jericho was once more 'a city of palms' when our Lord visited it. Here he restored sight to the blind (Matthew 20:30; Mark 10:46; Luke 18:35). Here the descendant of Rahab did not disdain the hospitality of Zacchaeus the publican. Finally, between Jerusalem and Jericho was laid the scene of his story of the good Samaritan.\"\n\nRoman province\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem to Vespasian's armies in the Great Revolt of Judea in 70 CE, Jericho declined rapidly, and by 100 CE it was but a small Roman garrison town. A fort was built there in 130 and played a role in putting down the Bar Kochba revolt in 133.\n\nByzantine period\nAccounts of Jericho by a Christian pilgrim are given in 333. Shortly thereafter the built-up area of the town was abandoned and a Byzantine Jericho, Ericha, was built 1600 metres (1 mi) to the east, on which the modern town is centered. Christianity took hold in the city during the Byzantine era and the area was heavily populated. A number of monasteries and churches were built, including the Monastery of Saint George of Choziba in 340 CE and a domed church dedicated to Saint Eliseus. At least two synagogues were also built in the 6th century CE. The monasteries were abandoned after the Sasanian invasion of 614.\nThe Jericho synagogue in the Royal Maccabean winter palace at Jericho dates from 70 to 50 BCE. A synagogue dating to the late 6th or early 7th century CE was discovered in Jericho in 1936, and was named Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue, or \"peace unto Israel\", after the central Hebrew motto in its mosaic floor.\nThe Na'aran synagogue, another Byzantine era construction, was discovered on the northern outskirts of Jericho in 1918. While less is known of it than Shalom Al Yisrael, it has a larger mosaic and is in a similar condition.\n\nEarly Muslim period\nJericho, by then named \"Ariha\" in Arabic variation, became part of Jund Filastin (\"Military District of Palestine\"), part of the larger province of Bilad al-Sham. The Arab Muslim historian Musa b. 'Uqba (died 758) recorded that caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab exiled the Jews and Christians of Khaybar to Jericho (and Tayma).\nBy 659, that district had come under the control of Mu'awiya, founder of the Umayyad dynasty. That year, an earthquake destroyed Jericho. A decade later, the pilgrim Arculf visited Jericho and found it in ruins, all its \"miserable Canaanite\" inhabitants now dispersed in shanty towns around the Dead Sea shore.\nA palatial complex long attributed to the tenth Umayyad caliph, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–743) and thus known as Hisham's Palace, is located at Khirbet al-Mafjar, about 1.5 kilometres (1 mi) north of Tell es-Sultan. This \"desert castle\" or qasr was more likely built by Caliph Walid ibn Yazid (r. 743–744), who was assassinated before he could complete the construction. The remains of two mosques, a courtyard, mosaics, and other items can still be seen in situ today. The unfinished structure was largely destroyed in an earthquake in 747.\nUmayyad rule ended in 750 and was followed by the Arab caliphates of the Abbasid and Fatimid dynasties. Irrigated agriculture was developed under Islamic rule, reaffirming Jericho's reputation as a fertile \"City of the Palms\". Al-Maqdisi, the Arab geographer, wrote in 985 that \"the water of Jericho is held to be the highest and best in all Islam. Bananas are plentiful, also dates and flowers of fragrant odor\". Jericho is also referred to by him as one of the principal cities of Jund Filastin.\n\nCrusader period\nIn 1179, the Crusaders rebuilt the Monastery of St. George of Koziba, at its original site 10 km (6 mi) from the center of town. They also built another two churches and a monastery dedicated to John the Baptist, and were credited by 19th-century authors with introducing sugarcane production to the city, although now scholars date it to the pre-Crusader, Early Arab period. The Crusaders, however, have raised sugar production to the level of a large-scale industry. The site of Tawahin es-Sukkar (lit. \"sugar mills\") holds remains of a Crusader sugar production facility. In 1187, the Crusaders were evicted by the Ayyubid forces of Saladin after their victory in the Battle of Hattin and the town slowly went into decline.\n\nAyyubid and Mamluk periods\nIn 1226, Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi said of Jericho, \"it has many palm trees, also sugarcane in quantities, and bananas. The best of all the sugar in the Ghaur land is made here.\" In the 14th century, Abu al-Fida writes that there are sulfur mines in Jericho, \"the only ones in Palestine\".\n\nOttoman period\n16th century\nJericho was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1545 a revenue of 19,000 Akçe was recorded, destined for the new Waqf for the Haseki Sultan Imaret of Jerusalem. The villagers processed indigo as one source of revenue, using a cauldron specifically for this purpose that was loaned to them by the Ottoman authorities in Jerusalem. Later that century, the Jericho revenues no longer went to the Haseki Sultan Imaret.\nIn 1596 Jericho appeared in the tax registers under the name of Riha, being in the nahiya of Al-Quds in the liwa of Al-Quds. It had a population of 51 households, all Muslims. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards and fruit trees, goats and beehives, water buffaloes, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 40,000 Akçe. All of the revenue still went to a Waqf.\n\n17th century\nThe French traveller Laurent d'Arvieux described the city in 1659 as \"now desolate, and consists only of about fifty poor houses, in bad condition ... The plain around is extremely fertile; the soil is middling fat; but it is watered by several rivulets, which flow into the Jordan. Notwithstanding these advantages only the gardens adjacent to the town are cultivated.\"\n\n19th century\nIn the 19th century, European scholars, archaeologists and missionaries visited often. At the time it was an oasis in a poor state, similar to other regions in the plains and deserts. Edward Robinson (1838) reported 50 families, which were about 200 people, Titus Tobler (1854) reported some 30 poor huts, whose residents paid a total of 3611 kuruş in tax. Abraham Samuel Herschberg (1858–1943) also reported after his 1899–1900 travels in the region of some 30 poor huts and 300 residents. At that time, Jericho was the residence of the region's Turkish governor. The main water sources for the village were a spring called Ein al-Sultan, lit. \"Sultan's Spring\", in Arabic and Ein Elisha, lit. \"Elisha Spring\", in Hebrew, and springs in Wadi Qelt.\nJ. S. Buckingham (1786–1855) describes in his 1822 book how the male villagers of er-Riha, although nominally sedentary, engaged in Bedouin-style raiding, or ghazzu: the little land cultivation he observed was done by women and children, while men spent most of their time riding through the plains and engaging in \"robbery and plunder\", their main and most profitable activity.\nAn Ottoman village list from around 1870 showed that Riha, Jericho, had 36 houses and a population of 105, though the population count included men only.\nThe first excavation at Tell es-Sultan was carried out in 1867.\n\n20th century\nIn Jericho and the Jordan Valley, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem acquired estates that supported agricultural development and served as symbols of its renewed presence in the countryside. The Greek Orthodox monasteries of St. George of Choziba and John the Baptist were refounded and completed in 1901 and 1904, respectively.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nAfter the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Jericho came under British rule, as part of Mandatory Palestine.\nAccording to the 1922 census of Palestine, Jericho had 1,029 inhabitants (931 Muslims, 92 Christians, and six Jews). The Christian population consisted of 45 Orthodox, 12 Roman Catholics, 13 Greek Catholics (Melkite Catholics), 6 Syrian Catholic, 11 Armenians, four Copts and one Church of England.\nIn 1927, an earthquake struck and affected Jericho and other cities. Around 300 people died, but by the 1931 census the population had increased to 1,693 inhabitants (1,512 Muslims, 170 Christians, seven Druze, and four Jews), in 347 houses.\nIn the 1938 statistics, Jericho lists a population of 1,996 people (including five Jews).\nIn the 1945 statistics, Jericho's population was 3,010 (2,570 Muslims, 260 Christians, 170 Jews, and 10 \"other\") and it had jurisdiction over 37,481 dunams of land. Of this, 948 dunams were used for citrus and bananas, 5,873 dunams were for plantations and irrigable land, 9,141 for cereals, while a total of 38 dunams were urban, built-up areas.\nDuring World War II The British built fortresses in Jericho with the help of the Jewish company Solel Boneh, and bridges were rigged with explosives in preparation for a possible invasion by German allied forces.\n\nJordanian period\nJericho came under Jordanian control after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The Jericho Conference, organized by King Abdullah and attended by over 2,000 Palestinian delegates in 1948 proclaimed \"His Majesty Abdullah as King of all Palestine\" and called for \"the unification of Palestine and Transjordan as a step toward full Arab unity\". In mid-1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank and Jericho residents, like other residents of West Bank localities became Jordanian citizens.\nIn 1961, the population of Jericho was 10,166, of whom 935 were Christian, and the rest were Muslim.\n\n1967 and aftermath\nJericho has been occupied by Israel since the Six-Day War of 1967 along with the rest of the West Bank. It was the first city handed over to Palestinian Authority control in accordance with the Oslo Accords. The limited Palestinian self-rule of Jericho was agreed on in the Gaza–Jericho Agreement of 4 May 1994. Part of the agreement was a \"Protocol on Economic Relations\", signed on 29 April 1994. The city is in an enclave of the Jordan Valley that is in Area A of the West Bank, while the surrounding area is designated as being in Area C under full Israeli military control. Four roadblocks encircle the enclave, restricting Jericho's Palestinian population's movement through the West Bank.\nThe Jericho synagogue was controlled by Israel after the Six-Day War, but after the handover to Palestinian Authority control per the Oslo Accords, it has been a source of conflict. On the night of 12 October 2000, the synagogue was vandalized by Palestinians who burned holy books and relics and damaged the mosaic.\nIn response to the 2001 Second Intifada and suicide bombings, Jericho was re-occupied by Israeli troops. A 2 m (6 ft 7 in) deep trench was built around a large part of the city to control Palestinian traffic to and from Jericho.\nOn 14 March 2006, the Israel Defense Forces launched Operation Bringing Home the Goods, raiding a Jericho prison to capture the PFLP general secretary, Ahmad Sa'adat, and five other prisoners, all of whom had been charged with assassinating the Israeli tourist minister Rehavam Zeevi in 2001.\nAfter Hamas assaulted a neighborhood in Gaza mostly populated by the Fatah-aligned Hilles clan, in response to their attack that killed six Hamas members, the Hilles clan was relocated to Jericho on 4 August 2008.\nIn 2009, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs David Johnson inaugurated the Presidential Guard Training Center in Jericho, a $9.1 million training facility for Palestinian Authority security forces built with U.S. funding. In 2024, a Jericho street was named after Aaron Bushnell, a U.S. soldier who self-immolated in support of Palestine.\nThe city had a population of 20,907 in 2017.\n\nGeography and environment\nJericho is located 258 m (846 ft) below sea level in an oasis in Wadi Qelt in the Jordan Valley, which makes it the lowest city in the world. The nearby spring of Ein es-Sultan produces 3.8 m3 (1,000 gallons) of water per minute, irrigating some 10 square kilometres (2,500 acres) through multiple channels and feeding into the Jordan River, 10 kilometres (6 mi) away.\n\nImportant Bird Area\nA 3,500 ha (8,600-acre) site encompassing the city of Jericho and its immediate surrounds has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of black francolins, lanner falcons, lesser kestrels, and Dead Sea sparrows.\n\nClimate\nAnnual rainfall is 204 mm (8.0 in), mostly concentrated in the winter months and into early spring. The average temperature is 11 °C (52 °F) in January and 31 °C (88 °F) in July. According to the Köppen climate classification, Jericho has a hot desert climate (BWh). Rich alluvial soil and abundant spring water have made Jericho an attractive place for settlement.\n\nDemographics\nIn the first census carried out by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, Jericho's population was 14,674. Palestinian refugees constituted  43.6% of the residents or 6,393 people. The gender make-up of the city was 51% male and 49% female. Jericho has a young population, with nearly half (49.2%) of the inhabitants being under the age of 20. People between the ages of 20 and 44 made up 36.2% of the population, 10.7% between the ages of 45 and 64, and 3.6% were over the age of 64. In the 2007 census by the PCBS, Jericho had a population of 18,346.\nIn a 1945 land and population survey by Sami Hadawi, 3,010 inhabitants is the figure given for Jericho, of which 94% (2840) were Arab and 6% (170) were Jews. Today, the overwhelming majority of the population is Muslim. The Christian community makes up around 1% of the population. A large community of black Palestinians lives in Jericho.\n\nEconomy\nIn 1994, Israel and Palestine signed an economic accord that enabled Palestinians in Jericho to open banks, collect taxes and engage in export and import in preparation for self-rule. Agriculture is another source of income, with banana groves ringing the city.\nThe Jericho Agro-Industrial Park is a public-private enterprise being developed in the Jericho area. Agricultural processing companies are being offered financial concessions to lease plots of land in the park in a bid to boost Jericho's economy.\n\nTourism\nIn 1998, a $150 million casino-hotel was built in Jericho with the backing of Yasser Arafat. The casino is now closed, though the hotel on the premises is open for guests.\nIn 2010, Jericho, with its proximity to the Dead Sea, was declared the most popular destination among Palestinian tourists.\n\nBiblical and Christian landmarks\nChristian tourism is one of Jericho's primary sources of income. There are several major Christian pilgrimage sites in and around Jericho.\n\nEin es-Sultan, known as the Spring of Elisha to Jews and Christians;\nQasr al-Yahud on the Jordan River, across from Bethany beyond the Jordan, traditionally identified as the location of the baptism of Jesus;\nMount of Temptation (Jebel Quruntul), traditionally identified as the location of the Temptation of Jesus;\nThe Greek Orthodox Monastery of the Temptation halfway up the mountain, beside a cave said to be the location where Jesus fasted for 40 days. It is connected to Jericho by a cable car;\n2 sycamore trees, both identified as the one mentioned in relation to Zacchaeus;\nDeir Hajla, the monastery of St. Gerasimos in the Jordan Valley near Jericho;\nSaint George Monastery in Wadi Qelt above Jericho.\n\nArchaeological landmarks\nStone, Bronze and Iron Age cities at Tell es-Sultan;\nHasmonean and Herodian winter palaces at Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq;\nByzantine-period synagogues at Jericho (Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue) and Na'aran;\nUmayyad palace at Khirbet al-Mafjar known as Hisham's Palace;\nCrusader sugar production facility at Tawahin es-Sukkar (lit. \"sugar mills\");\nNabi Musa, the Mamluk and Ottoman shrine claimed to be the resting place of Moses (\"Prophet Musa\" to the Muslims)\n\nSchools and religious institutions\nIn 1925, Christian friars opened a school for 100 pupils that became the Terra Santa School. The city has 22 state schools and a number of private schools.\n\nHealth care\nIn April 2010, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) held a groundbreaking ceremony for the renovation of the Jericho Governmental Hospital. USAID is providing $2.5 million in funding for this project.\n\nSports\nThe sports team Hilal Areeha plays association football in the West Bank First Division. They play home games in the 15,000-spectator Jericho International Stadium.\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nJericho is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nMusa Alami\n\nSee also\nAncient underground quarry, Jordan Valley, some 5 km (3 mi) north of Jericho\nal-Auja, Jericho, a Palestinian village north of Jericho\nBattle of Jericho, biblical story\nCities in the Book of Joshua\nHasmonean royal winter palaces, actually Hasmonean and Herodian, at Tulul Abu al-'Alayiq south of Jericho proper\nHistory of pottery in Palestine\nJawa, Jordan, the oldest proto-urban settlement from Jordan (late 4th millennium BC – Early Bronze Age)\nMevo'ot Yericho, Israeli settlement just north of Jericho\nTower of Jericho, the Neolithic stone tower, c. 10,000 years old, excavated at Tell es-Sultan\nWall of Jericho, the Neolithic stone wall, c. 10,000 years old, excavated at Tell es-Sultan\n\nCitations\nGeneral and cited references\nExternal links\n\nWelcome to Jericho\nJericho City (Fact Sheet), Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem, Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem (ARIJ)\nJericho City Profile, ARIJ\nJericho aerial photo, ARIJ\nLocality Development Priorities and Needs in Jericho City, ARIJ\nJericho Municipality Official Website Archived 6 February 2021 at the Wayback Machine\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 18: IAA, Wikimedia commons\nJericho Municipality Official Website Historical site\nJericho Cable Car\nResources on Biblical Archaeology\nJericho: Tel es-Sultan Archived 13 October 2008 at the Wayback Machine\nThe walls of Jericho fell in 1550 BCE",
          "summary": "Jericho ( JERR-ik-oh; Arabic: أريحا, romanized: Arīḥā, IPA: [ʔaˈriːħaː] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Jericho Governorate. The city is located in the Jordan Valley, with the Jordan River to the east and Jerusalem to the west.\nJericho is among the oldest cities in the world. Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of more than 20 successive settlements in Jericho, the first of which dates back 11,000 years (to 9000 BCE), almost to the very beginning of the Holocene epoch of the Earth's history. Copious springs in and around the city have attracted human habitation for thousands of years. Jericho is described in the Bible as the \"city of palm trees\".\nFollowing the era of Mandatory Palestine, the West Bank was annexed and ruled by Jordan starting in 1950, then was occupied by Israel in 1967. Administrative control of Jericho was handed over to the Palestinian Authority in 1994.\nThe city had a population of 20,907 in 2017. In 2023, the archaeological site in the center of the city, known as Tell es-Sultan / Old Jericho, was inscribed in UNESCO's list as a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine, and described as the \"oldest fortified city in the world\".",

          "title": "Nablus",
          "content": "Nablus ( NA(H)B-ləs; Arabic: نابلس, romanized: Nābulus, locally [ˈnæːblɪs] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Nablus Governorate. It is located approximately 49 kilometres (30 mi) north of Jerusalem, between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim with a population of 156,906. The city is a commercial and cultural centre of Palestine, home to An-Najah National University, one of the largest institutions of higher learning in Palestine, and the Palestine Stock Exchange. Nablus is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).\nNablus has been traditionally associated with the ancient city of Shechem. However, Shechem is now identified with the nearby site of Tell Balata in the Balata al-Balad suburb of the West Bank.\nThe modern name of the city can be traced back to the Roman period, when it was named Flavia Neapolis by Roman emperor Vespasian in 72 CE. During the Byzantine period, conflict between the city's Samaritan and newer Christian inhabitants peaked in the Samaritan revolts that were eventually suppressed by the Byzantines by 573, which greatly dwindled the Samaritan population of the city. Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, the city was given its present-day Arabic name of Nablus. After the First Crusade, the Crusaders drafted the laws of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Council of Nablus, and its Christian, Samaritan, and Muslim inhabitants prospered. The city then came under the control of the Ayyubids and the Mamluk Sultanate. Under the Ottoman Turks, who conquered the city in 1517, Nablus served as the administrative and commercial centre for the surrounding area corresponding to the modern-day northern West Bank. Much of Nablus' history is preserved in its Old City, which contains more than 100 monumental buildings.\nAfter the city was captured by British forces during World War I, Nablus was incorporated into Mandatory Palestine in 1922. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Nablus, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Since the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, the West Bank has been occupied by Israel; since 1995, it has been governed by the Palestinian Authority as part of Area A of the West Bank. Today, the population is predominantly Muslim, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities.\n\nHistory\nClassical antiquity\nFlavia Neapolis ('new city of the emperor Flavius') was named in 72 CE by the Roman emperor Vespasian and applied to an older Samaritan village, variously called Mabartha ('the passage') or Mamorpha. Located between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, the new city lay 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) west of the Biblical city of Shechem which was destroyed by the Romans that same year during the First Jewish–Roman War. Holy places at the site of the city's founding include Joseph's Tomb and Jacob's Well. Because of the city's strategic geographic position and the abundance of water from nearby springs, Neapolis prospered, accumulating extensive territory, including the former Judean toparchy of Acraba.\nInsofar as the hilly topography of the site would allow, the city was built on a Roman grid plan and settled with veterans who fought in the victorious legions and other foreign colonists. In the 2nd century CE, Emperor Hadrian built a grand theater in Neapolis that could seat up to 7,000 people. Coins found in Nablus dating to this period depict Roman military emblems and gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon such as Zeus, Artemis, Serapis, and Asklepios. Neapolis was entirely pagan at this time. Justin Martyr who was born in the city c. 100 CE, came into contact with Platonism, but not with Christians there. The city flourished until the civil war between Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger in 198–9 CE. Having sided with Niger, who was defeated, the city was temporarily stripped of its legal privileges by Severus, who designated these to Sebastia instead.\n\nIn 244 CE, Philip the Arab transformed Flavius Neapolis into a Roman colony named Julia Neapolis. It retained this status until the rule of Trebonianus Gallus in 251 CE. The Encyclopaedia Judaica speculates that Christianity was dominant in the 2nd or 3rd century, with some sources positing a later date of 480 CE. It is known for certain that a bishop from Nablus participated in the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. The presence of Samaritans in the city is attested to in literary and epigraphic evidence dating to the 4th century CE. As yet, there is no evidence attesting to a Jewish presence in ancient Neapolis.\nSi'on suggested that Neapolis was about 900 acres (360 ha) in size during the Byzantine period, making it three times larger than it was when it was first established as a Roman colony. Magen estimates that around 20,000 people lived there during this period.\n\nConflict among the Christian population of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis was within the Palaestina Prima province under the rule of the Byzantine Empire. The tension was a result of Monophysite Christian attempts to prevent the return of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Juvenal, to his episcopal see. However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.\nAs tensions among the Christians of Neapolis decreased, tensions between the Christian community and the Samaritans grew dramatically. In 484, the city became the site of a deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of Aaron's sons and grandsons Eleazar, Ithamar and Phinehas. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to Constantinople, requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor Zeno erected a church dedicated to Mary on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and expropriated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.\nThus, the Samaritans rebelled again under the rule of emperor Anastasius I, reoccupying Mount Gerizim, which was subsequently reconquered by the Byzantine governor of Edessa, Procopius. A third Samaritan revolt which took place under the leadership of Julianus ben Sabar in 529 was perhaps the most violent. Neapolis' bishop Ammonas was murdered and the city's priests were hacked into pieces and then burned together with the relics of saints. The forces of Emperor Justinian I were sent in to quell the revolt, which ended with the slaughter of the majority of the Samaritan population in the city.\n\nEarly Muslim period\nNeapolis, along with most of Palestine, was conquered by the Muslims under Khalid ibn al-Walid, a general of the Rashidun army of Umar ibn al-Khattab, in 636 after the Battle of Yarmouk. The city's name was retained in its Arabicized form, Nabulus. The town prevailed as an important trade center during the centuries of Islamic Arab rule under the Umayyad, Abbasid and Fatimid dynasties.\nUnder Muslim rule, Nablus contained a diverse population of Arabs and Persians, Muslims, Samaritans, Christians and Jews. In the 9th century CE, Al-Yaqubi reported that Nablus had a mixed population of Arabs, Ajam (Non-Arabs), and Samaritans. In the 10th century, the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi, described it as abundant of olive trees, with a large marketplace, a finely paved Great Mosque, houses built of stone, a stream running through the center of the city, and notable mills. He also noted that it was nicknamed \"Little Damascus.\" At the time, the linen produced in Nablus was well known throughout the Old World.\n\nCrusader period\nThe city was captured by Crusaders in 1099, under the command of Prince Tancred, and renamed Naples. Though the Crusaders extorted many supplies from the population for their troops who were en route to Jerusalem, they did not sack the city, presumably because of the large Christian population there. Nablus became part of the royal domain of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Muslim, Eastern Orthodox Christian, and Samaritan populations remained in the city and were joined by some Crusaders who settled therein to take advantage of the city's abundant resources. In 1120, the Crusaders convened the Council of Nablus out of which was issued the first written laws for the kingdom. They converted the Samaritan synagogue in Nablus into a church. The Samaritan community built a new synagogue in the 1130s. In 1137, Arab and Turkish troops stationed in Damascus raided Nablus, killing many Christians and burning down the city's churches. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking the city. Queen Melisende of Jerusalem resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161, after she was granted control over the city in order to resolve a dispute with her son Baldwin III. Crusaders began building Christian institutions in Nablus, including a church dedicated to the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus, and in 1170 they erected a hospice for pilgrims.\n\nAyyubid and Mamluk rule\nCrusader rule came to an end in 1187, when the Ayyubids led by Saladin captured the city. According to a liturgical manuscript in Syriac, Latin Christians fled Nablus, but the original Eastern Orthodox Christian inhabitants remained. Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179–1229), wrote that Ayyubid Nablus was a \"celebrated city in Filastin (Palestine)... having wide lands and a fine district.\" He also mentions the large Samaritan population in the city. After its recapture by the Muslims, the Great Mosque of Nablus, which had become a church under Crusader rule, was restored as a mosque by the Ayyubids, who also built a mausoleum in the old city.\n\nIn October 1242, Nablus was raided by the Knights Templar. This was the conclusion of the 1242 campaign season in which the Templars had joined forces with the Ayyubid emir of Kerak, An-Nasir Dawud, against the Mamluks. The Templars raided Nablus in revenge for a previous massacre of Christians by their erstwhile ally An-Nasir Dawud. The attack is reported as a particularly bloody affair lasting for three days, during which the Mosque was burned and many residents of the city, Christians alongside Muslims, were killed or sold in the slave markets of Acre.\nThe successful raid was widely publicized by the Templars in Europe; it is thought to be depicted in a late 13th-century fresco in the Templar church of San Bevignate, Perugia.\nThe Samaritan synagogue, built in 362 by the high priest Akbon, and later converted into a church by the Crusaders, was converted into al-Khadra Mosque in 1244. Two other Crusader churches became the An-Nasr Mosque and al-Masakim Mosque during that century.\nThe Mamluk dynasty gained control of Nablus in 1260 and during their reign, they built numerous mosques and schools. Under Mamluk rule, Nablus possessed running water, many Turkish baths and exported olive oil and soap to Egypt, Syria, the Hejaz, several Mediterranean islands, and the Arabian Desert. The city's olive oil was also used in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. Ibn Battuta, the Arab explorer, visited Nablus in 1355, and described it as a city \"full of trees and streams and full of olives.\" He noted that the city grew and exported carob jam to Cairo and Damascus.\n\nOttoman era\nNablus came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, along with the whole of Palestine. The Ottomans divided Palestine into six sanjaks ('districts'): Safad, Jenin, Jerusalem, Gaza, Ajlun and Nablus, all of which were part of Ottoman Syria. These five sanjaks were subdistricts of the Vilayet of Damascus. Sanjak Nablus was further subdivided into five nahiya ('subdistricts'), in addition to the city itself. The Ottomans did not attempt to restructure the political configuration of the region on the local level such that the borders of the nahiya were drawn to coincide with the historic strongholds of certain families. Nablus was only one among a number of local centers of power within Jabal Nablus, and its relations with the surrounding villages, such as Beita and Aqraba, were partially mediated by the rural-based chiefs of the nahiya. During the 16th century, the population was predominantly Muslim, with Jewish, Samaritan and Christian minorities.\nAfter decades of upheavals and rebellions mounted by Arab tribes in the Middle East, the Ottomans attempted to reassert centralized control over the Arab vilayets. In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force led mostly by Arab sipahi officers from central Syria to reassert Ottoman authority in Nablus and its hinterland, as part of a broader attempt to established centralized rule throughout the empire at that time. In return for their services, the officers were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid creating contiguous territory controlled by individual clans. Contrary to its centralization purpose, the 1657 campaign allowed the Arab sipahi officers to establish their own increasingly autonomous foothold in Nablus. The officers raised their families there and intermarried with the local notables of the area, namely the ulama and merchant families. Without abandoning their nominal military service, they acquired diverse properties to consolidate their presence and income such as soap and pottery factories, bathhouses, agricultural lands, grain mills and, olive and sesame oil presses.\nThe most influential military family were the Nimrs, who were originally local governors of Homs and Hama's rural subdistricts. Other officer families included the Akhrami, Asqalan, Bayram, Jawhari, Khammash, Mir'i, Shafi, Sultan and Tamimi families, some of which remained in active service, while some left service for other pursuits. In the years following the 1657 campaign, two other families migrated to Nablus: the Jarrars from Balqa and the Tuqans from northern Syria or Transjordan. The Jarrars came to dominate the hinterland of Nablus, while the Tuqans and Nimrs competed for influence in the town. The former held the post of mutasallim ('tax collector, strongman') of Nablus longer, though non-consecutively than any other family. The three families maintained their power until the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, Zahir al-Umar, the autonomous Arab ruler of the Galilee became a dominant figure in Palestine. To build up his army, he strove to gain a monopoly over the cotton and olive oil trade of the southern Levant, including Jabal Nablus, which was a major producer of both crops. In 1771, during the Egyptian Mamluk invasion of Syria, Zahir aligned himself with the Mamluks and besieged Nablus, but did not succeed in taking the city. In 1773, he tried again without success. Nevertheless, from a political perspective, the sieges led to a decline in the importance of the city in favor of Acre. Zahir's successor, Jezzar Pasha, maintained Acre's dominance over Nablus. After his reign ended in 1804, Nablus regained its autonomy, and the Tuqans, who represented a principal opposing force, rose to power.\n\nEgyptian rule and Ottoman revival\nIn 1831–32 Khedivate Egypt, then led by Muhammad Ali, conquered Palestine from the Ottomans. A policy of conscription and new taxation was instituted which led to a revolt organized by the a'ayan (notables) of Nablus, Hebron and the Jerusalem–Jaffa area. In May 1834, Qasim al-Ahmad—the chief of the Jamma'in nahiya—rallied the rural sheikhs and fellahin (peasants) of Jabal Nablus and launched a revolt against Governor Ibrahim Pasha, in protest at conscription orders, among other new policies. The leaders of Nablus and its hinterland sent thousands of rebels to attack Jerusalem, the center of government authority in Palestine, aided by the Abu Ghosh clan, and they conquered the city on 31 May. However, they were later defeated by Ibrahim Pasha's forces the next month. Ibrahim then forced the heads of the Jabal Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages. By the end of August, the countrywide revolt had been suppressed and Qasim was executed.\nEgyptian rule in Palestine resulted in the destruction of Acre and thus, the political importance of Nablus was further elevated. The Ottomans wrested back control of Palestine from Egypt in 1840–41. However, the Arraba-based Abd al-Hadi clan which rose to prominence under Egyptian rule for supporting Ibrahim Pasha, continued its political dominance in Jabal Nablus.\nThroughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Nablus was the principal trade and manufacturing center in Ottoman Syria. Its economic activity and regional leadership position surpassed that of Jerusalem and the coastal cities of Jaffa and Acre. Olive oil was the primary product of Nablus and aided other related industries such as soap-making and basket weaving. It was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant, topping the production of northern cities such as Damascus. Jabal Nablus enjoyed a greater degree of autonomy than other sanjaks under Ottoman control, probably because the city was the capital of a hilly region, in which there were no \"foreigners\" who held any military or bureaucratic posts. Thus, Nablus remained outside the direct \"supervision\" of the Ottoman government, according to historian Beshara Doumani.\n\nWorld War I and British Mandate\nBetween 19 September and 25 September 1918, in the last months of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War the Battle of Nablus took place, together with the Battle of Sharon during the set piece Battle of Megiddo. Fighting took place in the Judean Hills where the British Empire's XX Corps and Royal Flying Corps attacked the Ottoman Empire's Yildirim Army Group's Seventh Army which held a defensive position in front of Nablus, and which the Eighth Army had attempted to retreat to, in vain.\nThe 1927 Jericho earthquake destroyed many of the Nablus' historic buildings, including the An-Nasr Mosque. Though they were subsequently rebuilt by Haj Amin al-Husayni's Supreme Muslim Council in the mid-1930s, their previous \"picturesque\" character was lost. During the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the British authorities demolished buildings in the Old City quarter of Qaryun suspected of harboring insurgents or hiding weapons. Jewish immigration did not significantly impact the demographic composition of Nablus, and it was slated for inclusion in the Arab state envisioned by the United Nations General Assembly's 1947 partition plan for Palestine.\n\nJordanian occupation\nDuring the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Nablus came under Jordanian occupation. Thousands of Palestinian refugees displaced from areas captured by Israeli forces arrived in Nablus, settling in refugee camps in and around the city. Its population doubled, and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps are still located within the city limits today: Ein Beit al-Ma', Balata and Askar. During the Jordanian occupation, the adjacent villages of Rafidia, Balata al-Balad, al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality. Nablus was occupied and annexed by Jordan in 1950.\n\nIsraeli period\nThe Six-Day War ended with the Israeli occupation of Nablus. Many Israeli settlements were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada were met by a back-to-the-land movement to secure self-sufficiency, and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production.\nBassam Shakaa was elected mayor in 1976, and four years later he survived an assassination attempt by the Jewish Underground on 2 June 1980, considered a terrorist group by Israel, which resulted in Shakaa losing both his legs. The Israeli administration removed him from office in the spring of 1982, and installed an army officer who ran the city for the following three and a half years.\nIn response to the murder of two Israeli teachers on 21 July near Jenin and the killing of another Israeli on 30 July, the Israeli army imposed a 5-day curfew on the city on 29 July 1985 that was lifted 2 hours a day. Najah University was closed for two months for hanging PLO propaganda posters.\nThe Israeli administration ended in January 1986 with the appointment of Zafer al-Masri as mayor. A popular leader of the Nablus Chamber of Commerce, al-Masri began a program of improvements in the town. Despite maintaining that he would have nothing to do with Israeli autonomy plans, he was assassinated on 2 March 1986, widely believed to be the work of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\nSalah el Bah'sh was shot with a rubber bullet by an Israeli soldier on 18 June 1989 whilst walking through the Nablus Casbah. Witnesses told B'Tselem that he was shot in the chest at close range after not responding to a soldier shouting \"Ta'amod\" (Halt!). Bah'sh died and the army indicated that an investigation was being carried out.\n\nPalestinian control\nJurisdiction over the city was handed over to the Palestinian National Authority on 12 December 1995, as a result of the Oslo Accords Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Nablus is neighbored by Israeli settlements, and was site of regular clashes with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during the First Intifada when the local prison was known for torture.\nThe city was a hub of Palestinian nationalist activity in the West Bank in the 1990s, and when the Second Intifada began, arsonists of Jewish shrines in Nablus were applauded. After the controversy over the Muhammad cartoons in Jyllands-Posten, published in Denmark in late September 2006, militias kidnapped two foreigners and threatened to kidnap more as a protest. Noa Meir, an Israeli military spokeswoman, said in 2008 that the city remains \"capital of terror\" of the West Bank.\nFrom the start of the Second Intifada, which began in September 2000, Nablus became a flash-point of clashes between the IDF and Palestinians. The city has a tradition of political activism, as evinced by its nickname, jabal al-nar (mountain of fire) and, located between two mountains, was closed off at both ends of the valley by Israeli checkpoints. For several years, movements in and out of the city were highly restricted. Nablus produced more Palestinian suicide attacks than any other city during the Second Intifada. The city and the refugee camps of Balata and Askar constituted the center of \"knowhow\" for the production and operation of the rockets in the West Bank.\nAccording to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 522 residents of Nablus and surrounding refugee camps, including civilians, were killed and 3,104 injured during IDF military operations from 2000 to 2005. In April 2002, following the Passover massacre—an attack by Palestinian militants that killed 30 Israeli civilians attending a seder dinner at the Park Hotel in Netanya—Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield, a major military operation targeting in particular Nablus and Jenin. At least 80 Palestinians were killed in Nablus during the operation and several houses were destroyed or severely damaged.\nThe operation also resulted in severe damage to the historic core of the city, with 64 heritage buildings being heavily damaged or destroyed. IDF forces reentered Nablus during Operation Determined Path in June 2002, remaining inside the city until the end of September. Over those three months, there had been more than 70 days of full 24-hour curfews. According to Gush Shalom, IDF bulldozers damaged the al-Khadra Mosque, the Great Mosque, the al-Satoon Mosque and the Greek Orthodox Church in 2002. Some 60 houses were destroyed, and parts of the stone-paving in the old city were damaged. The al-Shifa hammam was hit by three rockets from Apache helicopters. The eastern entrance of the Khan al-Wikala (old market) and three soap factories were destroyed in F-16 bombings. The cost of the damage was estimated at $80 million US.\nThe Old City of Nablus became a site of fierce clashes in August 2016 between a militant group and Palestinian police. Two Palestinian Police officers were killed by terrorists in the city on 18 August. Shortly after, the police raid on the suspected areas in the Old City deteriorated into a gun battle, in which three armed militants were killed, including one killed by beating following his arrest. The person beaten to death was the suspected “mastermind” behind the August 18 shooting - Ahmed Izz Halaweh, a senior member of the armed wing of the Fatah movement the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. His death was branded by the UN and Palestinian factions as a part of “extrajudicial executions.” A widespread manhunt for multiple gunmen was initiated by the police as a result, concluding with the arrest of one suspect Salah al-Kurdi on 25 August.\n\nGeography\nNablus lies in a strategic position at a junction between two ancient commercial roads; one linking the Sharon coastal plain to the Jordan valley, the other linking Nablus to the Galilee in the north, and the biblical Judea to the south through the mountains. The city stands at an elevation of around 550 meters (1,800 ft) above sea level, in a narrow valley running roughly east–west between two mountains: Mount Ebal, the northern mountain, is the taller peak at 940 meters (3,080 ft), while Mount Gerizim, the southern mountain, is 881 meters (2,890 ft) high.\nNablus is located 42 kilometers (26 mi) east of Tel Aviv, Israel, 110 kilometers (68 mi) west of Amman, Jordan and 63 kilometers (39 mi) north of Jerusalem. Nearby cities and towns include Huwara and Aqraba to the south, Beit Furik to the southeast, Tammun to the northeast, Asira ash-Shamaliya to the north and Kafr Qaddum and Tell to the west.\n\nOld City\nIn the center of Nablus lies the old city, composed of six major quarters: Yasmina, Gharb, Qaryun, Aqaba, Qaysariyya, and Habala. Habala is the largest quarter and its population growth led to the development of two smaller neighborhoods: al-Arda and Tal al-Kreim. The old city is densely populated and prominent families include the Nimrs, Tuqans, and Abd al-Hadis. The large fortress-like compound of the Abd al-Hadi Palace built in the 19th century is located in Qaryun. The Nimr Hall and the Tuqan Palace are located in the center of the old city. There are several mosques in the Old City: the Great Mosque of Nablus, An-Nasr Mosque, al-Tina Mosque, al-Khadra Mosque, Hanbali Mosque, al-Anbia Mosque, Ajaj Mosque and others.\nThere are six hamaams (Turkish baths) in the Old City, the most prominent of them being al-Shifa and al-Hana. Al-Shifa was built by the Tuqans in 1624. Al-Hana in Yasmina was the last hamaam built in the city in the 19th century. It was closed in 1928 but restored and reopened in 1994. Several leather tanneries, souks, pottery and textile workshops line the Old City streets. Also located in the Old City is the 15th-century Khan al-Tujjar caravanserai and the Manara Clock Tower, built in 1906.\n\nClimate\nThe relatively temperate Mediterranean climate brings hot, dry summers and cool, rainy winters to Nablus. Spring arrives around March–April and the hottest months in Nablus are July and August with the average high being 29.6 °C (85.3 °F). The coldest month is January with temperatures usually at 6.2 °C (43.2 °F). Rain generally falls between October and March, with annual precipitation rates being approximately 656 mm (25.8 in).\n\nDemographics\nIn 1596, the population consisted of 806 Muslim households, 20 Samaritan households, 18 Christian households, and 15 Jewish households. Local Ottoman authorities recorded a population of around 20,000 residents in Nablus in 1849. In 1867 American visitors found the town to have a population of 4,000 'the chief part of whom are Mohammedans', with some Jews and Christians and 'about 150 Samaritans'. In the 1922 British census of Palestine, there were a total of 15,947 inhabitants (15,238 Muslims, 544 Christians, 147 Samaritans, 16 Jews, and two Druze). Population continued to grow, rising to 17,189 (16,483 Muslims, 533 Christians, 160 Samaritans, seven Druze, and six Jews) at the 1931 census of Palestine with 309 in nearby suburbs (225 Muslims and 84 Christians).\nThe 1938 village statistics show a further increase to 19,200. The 1945 village statistics list the population as 23,250 (22,360 Muslims, 680 Christians, and 120 \"other\").\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Nablus had a population of 126,132 in 2007. In the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 100,034, including 23,397 refugees, accounting for about 24% of the city's residents. Nablus' Old City had a population of 12,000 in 2006. The population of Nablus city comprises 40% of its governorate's inhabitants.\nApproximately half of population is under 20 years old. In 1997, the age distribution of the city's inhabitants was 28.4% under the age of 10, 20.8% from 10 to 19, 17.7% from 20 to 29, 18% from 30 to 44, 11.1% from 45 to 64 and 3.7% above the age of 65. The gender distribution was 50,945 males (50.92%) and 49,089 females (49.07%).\n\nReligion\nIn 891 CE, during the early centuries of Islamic rule, Nablus had a religiously diverse population of Samaritans, Muslims and Christians. Arab geographer Al-Dimashqi, recorded that under the rule of the Mamluk Dynasty (Muslim Dynasty based in Egypt), local Muslims, Samaritans, Orthodox Christians, Catholics and Jews populated the city. At the 1931 census, the population was counted as 16,483 Muslims, 533 Christians, 6 Jews, 7 Druses and 160 Samaritans.  However, this census was taken after the 1929 Palestine riots which drove the Jews out of many majority-Arab cities.\nThe majority of the inhabitants today are Muslim, but there are small Christian and Samaritan communities as well. Much of the local Palestinian Muslim population of Nablus is believed to be descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Certain Nabulsi family names are associated with Samaritan ancestry – Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others. According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted because of persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to accept it.\nIn 1967, there were about 3,500 Christians of various denominations in Nablus, but that figure dwindled to about 650 in 2008. Of the Christian populace, there are seventy Orthodox Christian families, about thirty Catholic (Roman Catholic and Eastern Melkite Catholic) families and thirty Anglican families. Most Christians used to live in the suburb of Rafidia in the western part of the city.\nThere are seventeen Islamic monuments and eleven mosques in the Old City. Nine of the mosques were established before the 15th century. In addition to Muslim houses of worship, Nablus contains an Orthodox church dedicated to Saint Justin Martyr, built in 1898, and the ancient Samaritan synagogue, which is still in use.\n\nEconomy\nBeginning in the early 16th century, trade networks connecting Nablus to Damascus and Cairo were supplemented by the establishment of trading posts in the Hejaz and Gulf regions to the south and east, as well as in the Anatolian Peninsula and the Mediterranean islands of Crete and Cyprus. Nablus also developed trade relations with Aleppo, Mosul, and Baghdad. The Ottoman government oversaw the safety and funding of the annual hajj (qafilat al-hajj) from Damascus to the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Pilgrimage caravans became a key factor in the fiscal and political relationship between Nablus and the central government. For a brief period in the early 17th century, the governor of Nablus, Farrukh Pasha, was appointed leader of \nthe caravan (amir al-hajj), and he constructed a large commercial compound in Nablus for that purpose.\n\nIn 1882, there were 32 soap factories and 400 looms exporting their products throughout the Middle East. Nablus exported three-fourths of its soap — the city's most important commodity—to Cairo by caravan through Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula, and by sea through the ports of Jaffa and Gaza. From Egypt, and particularly from Cairo and Damietta, Nablus merchants imported mainly rice, sugar, and spices, as well as linen, cotton, and wool textiles. Cotton, soap, olive oil, and textiles were exported to Damascus, whence silks, high-quality textiles, copper, and a number luxury items, such as jewellery were imported. Outside  the city limits, extensive fields of olive groves, fig and pomegranate orchards and grape vineyards covered the  slopes. Crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, melons and mulukhiyya were grown in the fields and grain mills were  scattered across central Samaria. Nablus was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant, producing over 225,000 kg (496,040 lb) of the product by 1837.\nToday, Nablus has a bustling modern commercial center with restaurants, and shopping malls. Traditional industries\n such as the production of soap, olive oil, and Palestinian handicrafts continue to operate in Nablus.\n Other industries include furniture production, tile production, stone quarrying, textile manufacturing and leather tanning. The city is widely known for sweets like kunafah, olive oil, soap and ice-cream.\nThe Vegetable Oil Industry Co. is a Nablus factory that produces olive oil, and vegetable butter which is exported to Jordan. In 2000, the al-Huda Textiles factory in Nablus\nproduced 500 pieces of clothing daily; however, production dropped to 150–200 pieces in 2002. Al-Huda  imports textiles from China and exports finished products to Israel.  In 2003, there were eight restaurants  and four hotels — the largest being al-Qasr and al-Yasmeen. The  soap industry has suffered  from the West Bank closures and IDF incursions. In 2008, only two soap factories were still open. \n\nThe Al-Arz ice-cream company is the largest of six ice-cream manufacturers in the Palestinian territories. The Nablus business developed from an ice-factory set up by Mohammad Anabtawi in the town centre in 1950. It produces 50 tons a day, and exports to Jordan and Iraq. Most of the ingredients are imported from Israel.\nBefore 2000, 13.4% of Nablus' residents worked in Israel, with the figure dropping to 4.7% in 2004. The city's manufacturing sector made up 15.7% of the economy in 2004, a drop from 21% in 2000. Since 2000, most of the workforce has been employed in agriculture and local trade. In the wake of the Intifada, unemployment rates rose from 14.2% in 1997 to 60% in 2004. According to an OCHA report in 2008, one of the reasons for the high unemployment was a ring of checkpoints around the city, leading to the relocation of many businesses.\nSince the removal of the Hawara roadblock, the casbah has become a vibrant marketplace. Nablus is home to the Palestine Securities Exchange (PSE) and the al-Quds Financial Index, housed in the al-Qasr building in the Rafidia suburb of the city. The PSE's first trading session took place on 19 February 1997. In 2007, the capitalization of the PSE topped 3.5 million Jordanian dinars.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, 44,926 were enrolled in schools (41.2% in primary school, 36.2% in secondary school, and 22.6% in high school). About 19.8% of high school students received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas. In 2006, there were 234 schools and 93,925 students in the Nablus Governorate; 196 schools are run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 14 by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 24 are private schools.\nNablus is also home to an-Najah National University, the largest Palestinian university in the West Bank. Founded in 1918 by the an-Najah Nabulsi School, it became a college in 1941 and a university in 1977. An-Najah was closed down by Israeli authorities during the First Intifada, but reopened in 1991. Today, the university has three campuses in Nablus with over 16,500 students and 300 professors. The university's faculties include seven in the humanities and nine in the sciences.\nNablus has been ranked as the 5th best city in the Middle East to learn Arabic. For non-Arabic aspirants, An-Najah University has faculties, providing courses related to Arabic language.\n\nHealthcare\nThere are six hospitals in Nablus, the four major ones being al-Ittihad, St. Lukes, al-Watani (the National), and the Rafidia Surgical Hospital, which is located in the western neighborhood of Rafidiya, and is the largest hospital in the city. Al-Watani Hospital specializes in oncology services. The Anglican St. Lukes hospital was founded in 1900 by the medical missionary Gaskoin Wright; the National Hospital was founded in 1910. In addition to hospitals, Nablus contains the al-Rahma and at-Tadamon clinics, the al-Razi medical center, the Amal Center for Rehabilitation and 68 pharmacies. The Nablus Speciality Hospital was built in 2001, which is specializes in open heart surgery, angiograms and angioplasty.\n\nCulture and arts\nNablus and its culture enjoy a certain renown throughout the Palestinian Territories and the Arab world with significant and unique contributions to Palestinian culture, cuisine and costume. Nabulsi, meaning \"from Nablus\", is used to describe items such as handicrafts (e.g. Nabulsi soap) and food products (e.g. Nabulsi cheese) that are made in Nablus or in the traditional Nablus style.\n\nTraditional costume\nNablus costume was of a distinctive style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Because of its position as important trade center with a flourishing souk (\"market\"), in the late 19th century, there was a large choice of fabrics available in the city, from Damascus and Aleppo silk to Manchester cottons and calicos. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the Galilee, both long and short Turkish style jackets were worn over the thob (\"robe\"). For daily wear, thobs were often made of white cotton or linen, with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated interwoven striped bands of red, green and yellow on the front and back, with appliqué and braidwork popularly decorating the qabbeh (\"square chest piece\").\n\nCuisine\nNablus is one of the Palestinian cities that sustained elite classes, fostering the development of a culture of \"high cuisine\", such as that of Damascus or Baghdad. The city is home to a number of food products well known throughout the Levant, the Arab world and the former provinces of the Ottoman Empire.\nKanafeh (or Kunafa) is the best known Nabulsi sweet. It is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Now made throughout the Middle East, kanafeh Nabulsi uses a white-brine cheese called jibneh Nabulsi. Boiled sugar is used as a syrup for kanafeh.\nOther sweets made in Nablus include baklawa, \"Tamriya\", mabrumeh and ghuraybeh, a plain pastry made of butter, flour and sugar in an \"S\"-shape, or shaped as fingers or bracelets.\n\nCultural centers\nThere are three cultural centers in Nablus. The Child Cultural Center (CCC), founded in 1998 and built in a renovated historic building, operates an art and drawing workshop, a stage for play performances, a music room, a children's library and a multimedia lab. The Children Happiness Center (CHC) was also established in 1998. Its main activities include promoting Palestinian culture through social events, dabke classes and field trips. In addition to national culture, the CHC has a football and chess team. The Nablus municipal government established its own cultural center in 2003, called the Nablus Municipality Cultural Center (NMCC) aimed at establishing and developing educational facilities.\n\nSoap production\nNabulsi soap or sabon nabulsi is a type of castile soap produced only in Nablus and made of three primary ingredients: virgin olive oil, water, and a sodium compound. Since the 10th century, Nabulsi soap has enjoyed a reputation for being a fine product, and has been exported across the Arab world and to Europe. Though the number of soap factories decreased from a peak of thirty in the 19th century to only two today, efforts to preserve this important part of Palestinian and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue.\nMade in a cube-like shape about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) tall and 2.25 by 2.25 inches (5.7 by 5.7 cm) wide, the color of Nabulsi soap is like that of \"the page of an old book.\" The cubes are stamped on the top with the seal of the factory that produces it. The soap's sodium compound came from the barilla plant. Prior to the 1860s, in the summertime, the barilla would be placed in towering stacks, burned, and then the ashes and coals would be gathered into sacks, and transported to Nablus from the area of modern-day Jordan in large caravans. In the city, the ashes and coals were pounded into a fine natural alkaline soda powder called qilw. Today, qilw is still used in combination with lime.\n\nLocal government\nThe city of Nablus is the muhfaza (seat) of the Nablus Governorate, and is governed by a municipal council made up of fifteen elected members, including the mayor.\nThe two primary political parties in the municipal council are Hamas and Fatah. In the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections, the Reform and Change list representing the Hamas faction won 73.4% of the vote, gaining the majority of the municipal seats (13). Palestine Tomorrow, representing Fatah, gained the remaining two seats with 13.0% of the vote. Other political parties, such as the Palestinian People's Party and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine failed to gain any seats in the council, though they each received over 1,000 votes.\nYaish's four-year term legally expired in December 2009. While elections in the West Bank were scheduled for 17 July 2010, they were canceled because of Fatah's lack of agreement on list of candidates. Nablus was one of the most important municipalities where Fatah failed to resolve internal conflicts that resulted in two competing Fatah lists: one headed by former mayor Ghassan Shakaa and one headed by Amin Makboul.\nIn the October 2012 municipal elections, Hamas boycotted the polls, protesting the holding of elections while reconciliation efforts with Fatah were at a standstill. Former mayor Ghassan Shakaa, a former local Fatah leader, won the vote as an independent against Fatah member Amin Makboul and another independent candidate.\n\nMayors\nModern mayorship in Nablus began in 1869 with the appointment of Sheikh Mohammad Tuffaha by the Ottoman governor of Syria/Palestine. On 2 July 1980, Bassam Shakaa, then mayor of Nablus, lost both of his legs as a result of a car bombing carried out by Israeli militants affiliated with the Gush Emunim Underground movement.\nThe current mayor, Adly Yaish, a Hamas member, was arrested by the Israel Defense Forces in May 2007, during Operation Summer Rains, launched in retaliation for the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas. Municipal council members Abdel Jabbar Adel Musa \"Dweikat\", Majida Fadda, Khulood El-Masri, and Mahdi Hanbali were also arrested. He spent 15 months in prison without being charged.\n\nMunicipal services\nIn 1997, 99.7% of Nablus' 18,003 households were connected to electricity through a public network. Prior to its establishment in 1957, electricity came from private generators. Today, the majority of the inhabitants of 18 nearby towns, in addition to the city's inhabitants, are connected to the Nablus network.\nThe majority of households are connected to a public sewage system (93%), with the remaining 7% connected through cesspits. The sewage system, established n the early 1950s, also connects the refugee camps of Balata, Askar and Ein Beit al-Ma'. Pipe water is provided for 100% of the city's households, primarily through a public network (99.3%), but some residents receive water through a private system (0.7%). The water network was established in 1932 by the British authorities and is fed by water from four nearby wells: Deir Sharaf, Far'a, al-Badan and Audala.\n\nFire department\nNablus is one of the few cities in the West Bank to have a fire department, which was founded in 1958. At that time, the \"fire brigade\" (as it was called) was composed of five members and one extinguishing vehicle. In 2007, the department had seventy members and over twenty vehicles. Until 1986, it was responsible for all of the northern West Bank, but today it only covers the Nablus and Tubas Governorates. From 1997 to 2006, Nablus' fire department extinguished 15,346 fires.\n\nTransportation\nIn the early 20th century, Nablus was the southernmost station of a spur from the Jezreel Valley railway's Afula station, itself a spur from the Hejaz railway. The extension of the railway to Nablus was built in 1911–12. During the beginning of the British Mandate, one weekly train was operated from Haifa to Nablus via Afula and Jenin. The railway was destroyed during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and the route of the line was bisected by the Green Line.\nThe main Beersheba–Nazareth road running through the middle of the West Bank ends in Nablus, although the thoroughfare of local Arabs is severely restricted. The city was connected to Tulkarm, Qalqilya and Jenin by roads which are now blocked by the Israeli West Bank barrier. From 2000 until 2011, Israel maintained checkpoints such as Huwwara checkpoint which effectively cut off the city, severely curtailing social and economic travel. From January 2002, buses, taxis, trucks and private citizens required a permit from the Israeli military authorities to leave and enter Nablus. Since 2011, there has been a relaxation of travel restrictions and the dismantlement of some checkpoints.\nThe nearest airport is the Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod, Israel, but because of restrictions governing the entry of Palestinians to Israel, and their lack of access to foreign Embassies to get travel visas, many residents must travel to Amman, Jordan to use the Queen Alia International Airport, which requires passage through a number of checkpoints and the Jordanian border. Taxis are the main form of public transportation within Nablus and the city contains 28 taxi offices and garages.\n\nSports\nThe Nablus football stadium has a capacity of 8,000. The stadium is home to the city's football club al-Ittihad, which is in the main league of the Palestinian Territories. The club participated in the Middle East Mediterranean Scholar Athlete Games in 2000.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nNablus is twinned, or has sister city relationships with:\n\nSee also\nList of cities administered by the Palestinian National Authority\nList of people from Nablus\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nWelcome To The City of Nablus\nNablus City, Welcome to Palestine\nA site explaining the reasons for the devastated Palestinian economy\nNablus the Culture, reviving cultural life in Nablus Archived 15 April 2022 at the Wayback Machine\nNablus after Five Years of Conflict December 2005 report by OCHA (PDF).\nArchaeological Remains Found in Nablus\nPicture showing Nablus from east (Panorama)\nPicture showing east region of Nablus (Panorama) – The picture taken from Askar\nBahjat Sabri, \"Urban Aspects in the City of Nablus in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century\" An-Najah University Journal for Research - Humanities, Volume 6 (1992)",
          "summary": "Nablus ( NA(H)B-ləs; Arabic: نابلس, romanized: Nābulus, locally [ˈnæːblɪs] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Nablus Governorate. It is located approximately 49 kilometres (30 mi) north of Jerusalem, between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim with a population of 156,906. The city is a commercial and cultural centre of Palestine, home to An-Najah National University, one of the largest institutions of higher learning in Palestine, and the Palestine Stock Exchange. Nablus is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).\nNablus has been traditionally associated with the ancient city of Shechem. However, Shechem is now identified with the nearby site of Tell Balata in the Balata al-Balad suburb of the West Bank.\nThe modern name of the city can be traced back to the Roman period, when it was named Flavia Neapolis by Roman emperor Vespasian in 72 CE. During the Byzantine period, conflict between the city's Samaritan and newer Christian inhabitants peaked in the Samaritan revolts that were eventually suppressed by the Byzantines by 573, which greatly dwindled the Samaritan population of the city. Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, the city was given its present-day Arabic name of Nablus. After the First Crusade, the Crusaders drafted the laws of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Council of Nablus, and its Christian, Samaritan, and Muslim inhabitants prospered. The city then came under the control of the Ayyubids and the Mamluk Sultanate. Under the Ottoman Turks, who conquered the city in 1517, Nablus served as the administrative and commercial centre for the surrounding area corresponding to the modern-day northern West Bank. Much of Nablus' history is preserved in its Old City, which contains more than 100 monumental buildings.\nAfter the city was captured by British forces during World War I, Nablus was incorporated into Mandatory Palestine in 1922. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Nablus, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Since the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, the West Bank has been occupied by Israel; since 1995, it has been governed by the Palestinian Authority as part of Area A of the West Bank. Today, the population is predominantly Muslim, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities.",

لمحافظه نابلس التي تضم 56 قريه ويُقدر عدد سكانها بقرابه (388,321) نسمه حسب احصاءات عام 2017. تُعرف ايضا باسماء جبل النار ودمشق الصغرى وعش العلماء وملكه فلسطين غير المتوجه. لعبت المدينه ادوارًا مهمه خلال النزاعات في بلاد الشام، ويعتقد انها كانت اكبر مدينه في فلسطين في اواسط القرن الثامن عشر والنصف الاول من القرن التاسع عشر.\nفي القرنين الخامس والسادس للميلاد ادّى نزاع بين سكان المدينه من السامريين والمسيحيين الى بروز عدد من الانتفاضات السامريه ضد الحكم البيزنطي، قبل ان تقوم الامبراطوريه باخماد ثوراتهم هذه بالعنف، مما ادى لاضمحلال عددهم في المدينه.\nفتح العرب المسلمون، في زمن خلافه ابي بكر الصديق، هذه المدينه وباقي فلسطين وبلاد الشام، وفي هذا العهد عُرّب اسمها ليصبح نابلس بدلاً من نيابوليس، وازداد عدد المسلمين من سكانها واخذت بعض من كنائسها ومعابدها السامريه تتحول الى مساجد شيئاً فشيئاً، ثم سقطت نابلس تحت الحكم الصليبي عام 1099 قبل ان تعود لحكم المسلمين الايوبيين والمماليك بعدهم.\nاصبحت نابلس عاصمه سنجق نابلس في العهد العثماني، وكانت في هذه الفتره سنجقا تابعا لاياله دمشق ثم لاياله صيدا (التي خلفت اياله عكا واجزاء من اياله دمشق) واخيرًا ولايه بيروت وفي اخر تقسيم اداري عثماني خضعت المدينه للحكم المصري الذي دام تسع سنوات في بلاد الشام، في العقد الرابع من القرن التاسع عشر، وقبل ان تعود الى الحكم العثماني. احتلها البريطانيون عندما انهزمت الدوله العثمانيه في الحرب العالميه الاولى وخضعت فلسطين للانتداب البريطاني. وسقطت نابلس تحت الاحتلال الاسرائيلي عام 1967 حينها سقطت الضفه الغربيه باكملها.\nتشتهر المدينه القديمه بصناعه الصابون، وبالكنافه النابلسيه، التي تعتبر من اشهر الحلويات الشرقيه في بلاد الشام، بالاضافه الى بعض المنتجات الزراعيه مثل الزعتر النابلسي والجبن النابلسي.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالموقع\nاذا كانت فلسطين قلب الوطن العربي لربطها شماله بجنوبه وشرقه بغربه، فان نابلس هي قلب فلسطين لربطها شمالها بجنوبها وشرقها بغربها. كانت المدينه مركزاً للواء نابلس في الضفه الغربيه بعد عام 1948م وتحولت في منتصف الستينات مركزاً لمحافظه نابلس، تتمتع بموقع جغرافي هام فهي تتوسط اقليم المرتفعات الجبليه الفلسطينيه وجبال نابلس، وتعد حلقه في سلسله المدن الجبليه من الشمال الى الجنوب وتقع على مفترق الطرق الرئيسيه التي تمتد من الناصره وجنين شمالاً حتى الخليل جنوباً ومن يافا غرباً حتى جسر داميه شرقًا. تبعد عن القدس 69 كم وعن عمان 114 كم وعن البحر المتوسط 42 كم، تربطها بمدنها وقراها شبكه جيده من الطرق تصلها بطولكرم وقلقيليه ويافا غرباً وبعمان شرقاً وبجنين والناصره شمالاً وبالقدس جنوباً. في عام 1915 ربطت نابلس مع خط سكه حديد الحجاز الممتد من دمشق الى المدينه المنوره.\nاقيمت نابلس في اجمل بقعه جغرافيه في وسط فلسطين. وصفها شيخ الربوه الدمشقي بانها «قصر في بستان». قال عنها عمر السكندري في كتابه «تاريخ سوريا» المطبوع في بيروت عام 1882:\n\nيرتفع وسط مدينه نابلس 550 مترا فوق سطح البحر بينما يبلغ ارتفاع اطرافها حتى 800 متر ف.س.ب. تقدر مساحه المدينه العمرانيه بحوالي 12700 دونم. يمتد عمران المدينه فوق جبل عيبال شمالاً وجبل جرزيم جنوباً وبينهما وادٍ يمتد نحو الغرب. ولخصوصيه الموقع الجغرافي لمدينه نابلس المتمثله بانحصارها بين جبلين تتواجد في المدينه العشرات من عيون المياه التي تزيد من جمال وبهاء المدينه ومنها عين العسل، عين الست، عين الكاس، عين حسين، عين القريون، عين ميره، عين الخضر، عين الصلاحي، عين السكر، عين الصبيان، عين الساطور، عين العجيبه، عين بدران، عين التوباني، عين بير الدولاب، عين التوته بالاضافه الى سبل المياه مثل سبيل الغزاوي وسبيل الخضر وسبيل السلقيه وسبيل الساطور.\n\nتضم مدينه نابلس جامعه النجاح الوطنيه، كبرى الجامعات الفلسطينيه واقدمها وارفعها مستوى. اسست بلديه المدينه عام 1869 وهي تشرف على تنظيم المدينه وعلى المرافق العامه.\nتذكر كتب التاريخ وصف بعض الرحاله العرب لنابلس بدمشق الصغرى للتشابه مع دمشق بمعالمها ومناخها ومياهها وينابيعها وجبالها وفاكهتها وخضارها وحتى في لهجتها وكثير من عاداتها وتقاليدها. وهي اكثر مدن فلسطين شبهاً وارتباطاً بدمشق وسوريه منذ فجر التاريخ، حيث كان تجارها يصدرون الصابون والمنتجات المحليه الاخرى الى دمشق ويعودون بالاقمشه والتوابل. اضافه الى ذلك، يعود اصل العديد من عائلات نابلس الى مناطق في سوريه حالياً، مثل عائله النمر التي قدمت من منطقه حمص وحماه وعائله طوقان التي قدمت من منطقه حماه.\n\nالمناخ\nيسود في نابلس مناخ متوسطي معتدل، ذو صيف حار وجاف، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يحل فصل الربيع في اواخر شهر مارس (اذار) واوائل ابريل (نيسان)، ويعتبر شهرا يوليو (تموز) واغسطس (اب) احرّ شهور السنه، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحراره فيهما الى 28.9 ° مئويه (84 ° فهرنهايت)، اما اكثر الاشهر بروده فهو يناير (كانون الثاني)، ويصل فيه

بنابلس عدد كبير من القرى ولكنها معزوله عنها بالحواجز العسكريه الاسرائيليه، ففي الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه تم خنق المدينه بعده حواجز عسكريه مثل حاجز حواره من المدخل الجنوبي، وحاجز بيت ايبا من المدخل الغربي، وحاجز (17) من المدخل الشمالي وحاجز الباذان من المدخل الشرقي، وبعد انتهاء الانتفاضه الثانيه ازيلت هذه الحواجز، ثم اُنشئت حواجز جديده بعد عمليه طوفان الاقصى عام 2023 مثل حاجزي حواره وعورتا على طريق رام الله نابلس جنوباً، وحاجز المربعه قرب قريه تل من الجهه الجنوبيه الغربيه، وحاجز صره على طريق قلقيليه نابلس غرباً، وحاجز الطور جنوباً، وحاجز دير شرف من الجهه الغربيه الشماليه على طريق طولكرم نابلس، وحاجز مستوطنه شافي شمرون من الجهه الغربيه الشماليه على طريق جنين نابلس، اضافه الى بعض الحواجز العسكريه المتنقله غير الدائمه مثل حاجزي الباذان وبيت فوريك شرقاً، وحاجز (17) شمالاً.\nمن قراها:

سكان المدينه في عام 1596 يتالفون من 806 اسر مسلمه و18 اسره مسيحيه و15 اسره يهوديه و20 اسره سامريه، والاخيره طائفه دينيه يسمى افرادها بالسمره او السامريين. عاش السامريون قبل حرب 1967 في نابلس كمواطنين اردنيين يتمتعون بكافه حريات المواطنه كحال مسلمي ومسيحيي المدينه.\n\nخلال اوائل القرن التاسع عشر، قدر قسطنطين بازيلي سكان ناحيه نابلس بسته وعشرين الف عائله منها ما يقارب 1000 عائلهٍ مسيحيه. وتفيد السجلات العثمانيه ان عدد سكان نابلس بلغ 2000 نسمه عام 1849، وفي عام 1867 قال زوّار امريكيون، ان البلده بلغ عدد سكانها 4,000 نسمه «اكثرهم محمديون»، وبعض اليهود والمسيحيين، وحوالي 150 سامريّا. قدر عمر السكندري عام 1882 عدد سكانها بثمانيه الاف معظمهم مسلمون. وفي عام 1922 اظهر الاحصاء الرسمي البريطاني لسكان فلسطين، ان عدد سكان المدينه بلغ 15,947 نسمه، ثم ارتفع الى 17,498 عند احصاء عام 1931، و21900 نسمه عام 1941 ووصل عام 1945 الى حوالي 23300 نسمه. وبعد الاحتلال الصهيوني عام 1967 بلغ قرابه 61,050 نسمه، وعاد ليرتفع الى 106,900 عام 1987.\nبلغ عدد سكان نابلس 134,116 نسمه، في منتصف عام 2006، وفقًا للجهاز المركزي للاحصاء الفلسطيني. وفي احصاء الجهاز لعام 1997، ظهر ان عدد سكان المدينه وصل الى 100,034 نسمه، بما فيهم 23,397 لاجئ يشكلون 24% من سكان المدينه. وصل عدد سكان مدينه نابلس القديمه الى 12,000 نسمه عام 2006. تشكل المدينه المسكن لحوالي 40% من سكان المحافظه. توجد في المدينه اربعه مخيمات للاجئين الفلسطينيين هي عين بيت الماء وبلاطه وعسكر القديم وعسكر الجديد، يسكنها ما يفوق مجموعه ال40,000 نسمه.\nيشكل الشباب قسمًا كبيرًا من سكان نابلس، فقرابه نصف السكان يبلغون اعمارًا اقل من 20 سنه. بلغت نسبه السكان الذين تقل اعمارهم عن 10 سنوات، عام 1997، 28.4%، و20.8% للذين تتراوح اعمارهم بين 10 و19 سنه، 17.7% للذين تتراوح اعمارهم بين 20 و29 عام، 18% بين 30 و44 سنه، 11.1% بين 45 و64 سنه، و3.7% للذين تصل اعمارهم لاكثر من 65 عام. اما التوزيع بين الجنسين فكانت نسبته 50.92% (50,945 فردا) للذكور، و49.07% (49,089 فردا للاناث).\n\nالديانه\nكانت نابلس في عام 891 الميلادي، اي خلال العهود الاولى للحكم العربي، تحوي تنوعا دينيا كبيرا، وكان اكثريه سكانها يدينون بالاسلام، المسيحيه، والسامريه. يقول الجغرافي شمس الدين الانصاري الدمشقي، ان المدينه كانت خلال العهد المملوكي، ماهوله بالمسلمين، السامريين، المسيحيين الارثوذكس، المسيحيين الكاثوليك، واليهود. اظهر احصاء عام 1931 ان المدينه حوت 16,483 مسلمًا، 533 مسيحيًّا، 6 يهود، و167 شخص يدينون باديان اخرى، على الارجح ان معظمهم سامريّون.\nان معظم سكان نابلس اليوم يدينون بالاسلام، ولا يزال هناك ايضًا بعض المسيحيين والسامريين. يُعتقد ان كثيرًا من الفلسطينيين المسلمين في المدينه يتحدرون من سامريين اعتنقوا الاسلام عند الفتح الاسلامي لبلاد الشام، والبعض من اسماء العائلات المسلمه اليوم يتم ربطها بالسامريين ويُقال ان اجدادهم كانوا من اتباع ذلك الدين - مثل ال مسلماني وال يعيش وغيرهم. يقول المؤرخ فياض الطيف، ان اعدادًا كبيره من السامريين اعتنقوا الاسلام بسبب الاضطهاد الذي كانوا يتعرضون له، وبسبب الطبيعه التوحيديه للدين الجديد، الامر الذي جعلهم يتقبلونه بصوره اسهل واسرع.\nكان يسكن في المدينه حوالي 3,500 مسيحي عام 1967، ولكن اعدادهم انخفضت الى 650 عام 2008. يتالف المسيحيين في نابلس حاليّا، من 70 اسره روم ارثوذكس، حوالي 30 اسره من الروم الملكيين الكاثوليك، و30 اسره انجليكانيه. كان معظم المسيحيين يسكنون في ضاحيه رفيديا بالقسم الغربي من المدينه.\n\nتاريخ نابلس\nالتاريخ القديم\nنابلس او شكيم بالكنعانيه، مدينه من اقدم مدن العالم يعود تاريخها الى 5600 سنه (حوالي سنه 3600 ق.م). اسست عند ملتقى اقدام جبلي جرزيم في القسم الشرقي لمدينه نابلس الحاليه على يد العرب الكنعانيين فوق تل كبير يدعى الان تل بلاطه، وقد اسماها الكنعانيون في ذلك الوقت \"شكيم\" والتي تعني المكان المرتفع، ومن ثم اصبحت من اشهر المدن الكنعانيه. اقدم من سكن \"شكيم\" من العرب هم الحويون و‌الفرزيون. صارعت نابلس الكثير من الغزاه والمحتلين عبر تاريخها الطويل، بحيث غزاها كل من الفراعنه المصريين والقبائل العبريه والاشوريين والابليين والفارسيين واليونانيين والسلوقيين، الى ان سقطت بيد الرومان سنه 63 قبل الميلاد.\nورد ذكر شكيم في نصوص ايبلا التي اكتشفها عالم الاثار الايطالي باولو ماتييه ضمن مدن كنعانيه اخرى في فلسطين، وهي اضافه الى شكيم بيت جبرين واريحا واورسالم (يبوس) ومجيدو وبيسان. ورد ذكرها ايضاً في رسائل تل العمارنه (1400 ق.م) باسم شاكمي، كما ذكرت في تقارير تحتمس الثالث ايضاً.\n\nتشير النصوص المصريه القديمه بان شكيم كانت مدينهً محصنهً استراتيجيه ذات اهميه دوليه منذ سنه 1800 ق.م، كما كانت مركزاً للديانات الكنعانيه والحياه السياسيه، ويُفهم من النصوص المصريه القديمه ان علاقه فلسطين اصبحت وطيده بمصر ابتداءً من بدايه هذا العصر. وتتحدث رسائل تل العمارنه (سنه 1400-1350 ق.م) عن مدينه شكيم، تحت حكم اميرها الكنعاني لابعايو كمدينه تلعب دوراً هاماً في النضال ضد السيطره المصريه على منطقه فلسطين. وحسب ما ورد في التوراه فانها اول مدينه كنعانيه نزل فيها النبي ابراهيم الخليل قادماً من مدينه اور في العراق، وكان ذلك حوالي عام 1805 ق.م  وبعده اتى النبي يعقوب من فدان ارام على نهر الفرات في العراق، ونزل شكيم، ثم سكن مدينه كنعانيه تعرف باسم بيت ايل وتعني مقر الاله، وكانت مركز عباده الاله الكنعاني ال او ايل. ويذكر ان يعقوب عاد فيما بعد الى شكيم.\nوفي العصر الحديدي (1200-323 قبل الميلاد) استمرت المدن الكنعانيه بنفس نظام المدن المحصنه ذات القلاع خلال فترات العصر البرونزي. وتشير التوراه الى وجود حروب بين اليهود والكنعانيين الفلسطينيين. وقد سيطر اليهود على مدينتين كنعانيتين:\n\nالاولى: مدينه يبوس (اورشاليم)، مدينه اليبوسيين الكنعانيين وقلب مملكتهم منذ عصور ما قبل التاريخ، احتلها اليهود سنه 1000 ق.م بقياده النبي داود (100-963 ق.م)، ثم سليمان سنه 963 ق.م –923 ق.م. واستمر اليهود فيها تحت اسم مملكه يهودا حتى سقطت سنه 586 ق.م على يد نبوخذ نصر.\nالثانيه: مدينه شكيم، التي بدا نفوذهم فيها عام 923 ق.م وانتهى عام 722 ق.م على يد سرجون الثاني، وبقى فيها اهلها الكنعانيون، وتشير بعض المراجع الى احضار كنعانيين من الدواخل، وهم العموريون.\n\nسكنت مدينه شكيم فئه من بني اسرائيل لا تعترف من التوراه بغير الاسفار الخمسه الاولى المنسوبه الى النبي موسى، وتعرف هذه الفئه بالسامريين نسبه الى السامره. وقد ناصبهم اليهود العداء منذ ظهورهم. ويعتقد السامريون بان النبي ابراهيم همّ بالتضحيه بابنه اسحاق على جبل جرزيم. لا يزال معظم السامريين موجودين في مدينه نابلس حتى هذا اليوم ولا يتجاوز عددهم 250 نسمه، وقد خصص لهم مقعد في المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني المنتخب لاول مره في التاريخ الفلسطيني المعاصر عام 1996.\nسقطت فلسطين سنه 332 ق.م في يد الاسكندر المقدوني واصبحت تابعه للامبراطوريه اليونانيه حتى سنه 64 ق.م، وبعد وفاه الاسكندر خضعت للبطالمه والسـلوقيين. وقد تركت الهيلينيه بصماتها واضحه على بعض مظاهر الحياه ايام الحكم اليوناني وذلك بسبب انشاء سبعين مدينه ضخمه على الطراز الاغريقي في البلاد التي احتلها الجيش اليوناني. وقد اُستخدِمت مراكزَ ثقافيه نُشِرت بها الثقافه اليونانيه في بلدان العالم القديم. ومن المدن الثقافيه التي انشئت في العهد اليوناني بيلاوريون (تل الاشعري)، هيبوس (قلعه الحصن)، وهما تقعان شرق طبريا، ومدينه (فيلوتير) في الطرف الجنوبي من بحيره طبريا، وسميت بهذا الاسم نسبه الى فيلوتير شقيقه بطليموس الثاني فيلادلفوس، ومدينه جيراز (جرش). حول الاغريق الكثير من اسماء المدن الكنعانيه الفلسطينيه الى اسماء اغريقيه منها عكا، حيث سميت بتولما في عهد بطليموس الثاني، وبيت شان (بيسان) سميت سكيثوبوليس، وبيت جبرين اطلق عليها اليوثيروبوليس، وايلات سميت بيرينكه، وشكيم سميت نيابوليس. اصبحت المدينه تشتمل على رقعه واسعه من الاراضي تحيط بها الاسوار، وبها بوابات ضخمه ذات جلال، وفي داخل الاسوار يقع القصر الملكي او قصر الحاكم، وكذلك الساحه العامه والمدرج الضخم والمسرح وبرك السباحه والمعابد الضخمه المتعدده.\nوفي العصر الروماني (64 ق.م – 323 م) اقيم سور حول مدينه شكيم (السامره) طوله حوالي 170 اكد. اما بوابه المدينه فقد بنيت في الجهه الغربيه من المدينه وتضم برجين دائريين عظيمين بقطر 46 قدماً (14 متراً)، وهي مقامه على قواعد مربعه الشكل تعود للعصر الهيليني. ومبنى الباسيليكا في السامره يعود تاريخه الى العصر الروماني.\n\nوفي الفتره الممتده بين عاميّ 67 و69 للميلاد، قرر الرومان، تحت قياده الامبراطور فسبازيان، هدمها للمره الاخيره وبناء مدينه جديده الى الغرب منها اسموها «نيابوليس» اي المدينه الجديده والتي حرفت عنها لفظه نابلس الحاليه، وقد اقاموها وفق التخطيط الروماني في بناء المدن من حيث وجود شارعين متقاطعين ينتج عنهما اربع حارات، حيث ما زالت بعض هذه الحارات الرومانيه قائمه بتسميتها الرومانيه الى اليوم مثل حاره القيساريه. وفي عهد هادريان (117-138) اقام الرومان معبداً لجوبيتر على جبل جرزيم مكان معبد السامريين.\nوفي العصر البيزنطي (323 - 638) انتصرت المسيحيه فاصبحت كل فلسطين وبضمنها نابلس تدين بالمسيحيه واصبحت نابلس مركزاً لاسقفيه. وفي القرن الخامس الميلادي بنى الرومان المسيحيون على قمه جبل جرزيم كنيسه تخليداً لمريم العذراء. وفي عهد الامبراطور جستنيان (527-565) شيدت بالقرب من كنيسه مريم قلعه مسوره لا تزال اثارها باقيه، كما اعاد الرومان بناء خمس كنائس تهدمت في حروب سابقه.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nفي عام 638م فتح العرب المسلمون نابلس بقياده عمرو بن العاص في خلافه عمر بن الخطاب، وقد تعهد المسلمون بحمايه من بقي من اهلها على دينه من المسيحيين على ان يدفعوا الجزيه عن رقابهم والخراج عن اراضيهم. اصبحت نابلس بعد الفتح الاسلامي مدينه من مدن جند فلسطين الذي كانت قصبته اللد ثم الرمله.\nاستولى عليها الصليبيون في سنه 1099م بقياده تانكرد صاحب انطاكيه، وبنى بالدوين الاول (1100-1118م) ملك بيت المقدس الفرنجي فيها قلعه على راس جبل جرزيم لحمايه قواته ومراقبه تحركات المسلمين. وعقد فيها خلال الاحتلال الصليبي مجمع كنسي كبير في سنه 1120م تحت رعايه بالدوين الثاني (1118-1130م). غير الصليبيون اسمها الى (باللاتينيه: Naples).\nعادت نابلس بقراها وجبالها الى المسلمين سنه 1187م بعد انتصار صلاح الدين الايوبي في معركه حطين. ازال صلاح الدين ما احدثه الصليبيون من تغييرات فيها اثناء الاحتلال. بدات المدينه في العوده الى ازدهارها خاصه في زمن المماليك الذين خلفوا الايوبيين.\nضرب نابلس زلزال كبير سنه 1189 م، فتهدمت فيها مبان كثيره، ومات تحت الانقاض ثلاثون الفاً من اهلها.\nكانت نابلس مركز تجمع جيش المسلمين بقياده الملك الكامل خلال الحمله الصليبيه السادسه على الشام التي انطلقت في عام 1228م بقياده فردريك الثاني امبراطور المانيا وايطاليا.\nسقطت نابلس بيد التتار سنه 1260م، ولكنهم خرجوا في نفس السنه على يد قطز المملوكي.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nفي سنه 1517 م سيطر العثمانيون على بلاد الشام وبضمنها نابلس، واصبحت نابلس سنجقاً تابعاً لولايه دمشق، ووصلت المدينه اوج ازدهارها في عهدهم.\n\nكانت نابلس خلال القرنين الثامن عشر والتاسع عشر اهم مدينه تجاريه في فلسطين، متفوقه على القدس وعلى المدن الساحليه، ومن المحتمل انها كانت الاكبر سكانيا في فلسطين في هذا الوقت. حوالي عام 1849، وصل عدد سكانها الى عشرين الفًا على الاقل، ما جعلها الاكبر سكانيًا في فلسطين. كانت ايضاً اكبر مركز لانتاج القطن في الشام بكميه بلغت 225,000 كغم عام 1837. كانت المدينه مركزا لتجاره الاقمشه وكانت تصدر الصابون وزيت الزيتون والقطن الى دمشق وبيروت ومصر واوروبا.</\"ref name=\"BD> نتيجه لدورها التجاري المهم، تعرضت نابلس بدءاً من عام 1773 الى حصار عسكري واقتصادي تبعه احتلال قام به ظاهر العمر وخلفه احمد باشا الجزار لاضعاف دورها وتقويه دور عكا، ودام هذا الاحتلال حتى عام 1804. بعد دمار عكا الذي نتج عن هجوم ابراهيم باشا عام 1931-1932، عاده اهميه للازدياد مجددا. في سنه 1832 دخلت نابلس تحت الحكم المصري بقياده القائد ابراهيم باشا، وفي عام 1834 ثار اهل نابلس على الحكم المصري بسبب الضرائب والتجنيد الاجباري ولكنهم اخفقوا. دام هذا الحكم حتى سنه 1840 حيث عادت فلسطين الى الحكم العثماني. وفي نهايه الحكم العثماني اصبحت مدينه نابلس مركز سنجق تابع لولايه بيروت يمتد من نهر الاردن الى البحر المتوسط ويضم مئه قريه. ضرب زلزال كبير ثان نابلس في عام 1837 وادى الى تدمير حي كامل واحداث اضرار كبيره بحي اخر.\nمع نهايه القرن التاسع عشر، بدا دور نابلس بالتراجع مع زياده اهميه مدن اخرى مثل القدس التي اجتذبت مهاجرين يهود وحجاج مسيحيين، ويافا التي بدات بالازدهار نتيجه زياده تجارتها عبر الميناء.</\"ref name=\"BD> استمر التراجع في القرنين اللاحقين بفعل الاحتلال الاجنبي وانتقال مراكز الاداره والتجاره الى مدن اخرى. سقطت نابلس بيد البريطانيين في يوم 21 ايلول 1918 بعد معركه شهدت مقاومه شديده من الجنود العثمانيين. اخضعت فلسطين للانتداب البريطاني عام 1922 واصبحت نابلس مجدداً مركزاً للمقاومه. فجر البريطانيون اجزاءً كبيرهً من حاره القريون خلال ثوره 1936-1939 لقمع المقاومه.\n\nضرب زلزال قوي نابلس يوم 11 تموز من عام 1927  وادى الى تدمير 300 بيت ومبنى في مدينتها القديمه وبضمنها جامع النصر التاريخي  ويمكن رؤيه اثاره على كثير من المباني حتى اليوم. اظهر تعداد عام 1941 ان نابلس جاءت في المرتبه السادسه في تعداد السكان في فلسطين بعد القدس وتل ابيب وحيفا ويافا وغزه على الترتيب، وكانت تضم محكمتين عدليتين على الاقل.\n\nبعد نكبه فلسطين\nبعد نكبه فلسطين عام 1948 ضمت الضفه الغربيه بمحافظاتها الثلاث، نابلس والقدس والخليل، الى الاردن واصبحت في سنه 1950 جزءاً من المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه حتى احتلالها من قبل الاسرائيليين خلال حرب حزيران عام 1967م. منذ سقوطها حتى اليوم، شكلت نابلس احدى اهم بؤر المقاومه وسقط منها شهداء كثر من اقدمهم وابرزهم شاديه ابو غزاله عام 1968 والفتاه لينا النابلسي عام 1976. بعد اتفاق اوسلو، انسحبت قوات الاحتلال منها في 10 كانون الاول سنه 1995م، قبل اربعه ايام من الموعد المتفق عليه مع السلطه الفلسطينيه، وكانت الوحيده من بين المدن الفلسطينيه التي اخليت قبل موعدها.\n\nفي ظل السلطه الفلسطينيه\nفي ظل السلطه الفلسطينيه، استمر دور المدينه بالتراجع بسبب الحصار الاسرائيلي والعمليات العسكريه في مقابل الهدوء النسبي في مناطق اخرى (اهمها رام الله) وتركيز السلطه الفلسطينيه على بناء عاصمتها الجديده في رام الله، فانتقلت كثير من المؤسسات وادارات المصارف والشركات والمراكز الثقافيه ومراكز البحوث الى رام الله. نتيجه لذلك، ارتفعت نسبه البطاله في نابلس وتراجعت تجارتها. كانت الادارات الاقليميه للمصارف الاردنيه العامله في الضفه الغربيه اول من انتقلت من المدينه. بعد ذلك، بدات المؤسسات الثقافيه ودور الابحاث بالانتقال للاقتراب من مراكز صنع القرار في رام الله. على سبيل المثال، انتقل المركز الفلسطيني للبحوث السياسيه والمسحيه (وهو من اوائل مراكز البحوث واستطلاع الراي في فلسطين) من نابلس الى رام الله (وكان اسمه عند التاسيس مركز البحوث والدراسات الفلسطينيه). ايضا، قبل اقامه السلطه الفلسطينيه في رام الله، كانت هناك ثلاثه مراكز ثقافيه فرنسيه (تتبع للقنصليه الفرنسيه في القدس) في الاراضي الفلسطينيه (في القدس وغزه ونابلس)، وبعد اقامه السلطه الفلسطينيه في رام الله اقيم فرع رابع هناك تبعه اغلاق فرع المركز في نابلس.\n\nنابلس في ادب الرحلات\nذكر رحاله كثر نابلس في اعمالهم. من هؤلاء المقدسي في القرن العاشر الميلادي الذي وصفها في كتابه «احسن التقاسيم في معرفه الاقاليم» حيث قال: \n\nفي سنه 1325م زارها ابن بطوطه فوصفها بانها مدينه عظيمه كثيره الاشجار والماء ومن اكثر بلاد الشام زيتوناً، وبها مسجد جامع متقن وحسن في وسطه بركه ماء عذب.\nفي القرن التاسع الهجري، افاض مجير الدين الحنبلي العليمي في ذكر نابلس ونواحيها فقال فيما قال: \n\nفي سنه 1671م زارها الرحاله العثماني اولياجلبي، حيث ذكر انها مركز لواء تابع لولايه دمشق ويضم مائتي قريه. وذكر مساجدها وسوقها ومدارسها وحماماتها قائلاً: \n\n واغلب الظن انه قصد وجود الليمون والنخيل في غور نابلس وليس في جبالها.\n\nالاقتصاد والخدمات\nنابلس عاصمه فلسطين الاقتصاديه، وتعتبر المركز التجاري والصناعي الرئيس في فلسطين قبل النكبه  وفي الضفه الغربيه بعد ذلك. اضافهً الى ذلك، وهبها موقعها الجغرافي المميز وامطارها الغزيره (التي تعتبر الاغزر في فلسطين) اهميه كمركز لانتاج وتبادل المنتجات الزراعيه. كما تشتهر المدينه بصناعه الصابون والمصنوعات اليدويه والاثاث والبلاط وتشتهر بجوده حجارتها ومهاره حجّاريها ومصانع النسيج ودباغه الجلود. كما توجد على تخوم نابلس سوق لتبادل البضائع الحيّه كالمواشي وسوق الخضار المركزيه للضفه الغربيه. تضم نابلس الادارات العامه لكبريات الشركات الفلسطينيه مثل شركه الاتصالات الفلسطينيه وشركه فلسطين للتنميه والاستثمار (PADICO)، وفيها مقر بورصه نابلس المعروفه رسمياً بسوق فلسطين للاوراق الماليه. كانت نابلس مركزاً للادارات الاقليميه للمصارف الفلسطينيه والعربيه الموجوده في الضفه الغربيه قبل ان يتم نقل معظمها الى رام الله مع تاسيس السلطه الفلسطينيه هناك. تشتهر نابلس كذلك بعماره اسواقها، وخاصه في حي القصبه في المدينه القديمه، كما تشتهر بحلوياتها وخاصه «الكنافه» التي تنسب اجودها للمدينه.\n\nالصناعه\nكانت المدينه تشكل ثقلاً اقتصادياً هاماً قبل 1967م وكانت مدن الضفتين تعتمد عليها في بعض الصناعات وبعد الاحتلال ونتيجه لسياسه سلطات الاحتلال الالحقايه التي تقوم على تدمير الاقتصاد الوطني تعرضت الصناعات الكبيره فيها الى التراجع وهبوط مستوى انتاجها واهم هذه الصناعات مصانع الجلود والنسيج والكيمياويات والصناعات المعدنيه، وفي المدينه غرفه تجاره اسست عام 1943م.\nتشتهر المدينه بالكثير من المنتجات الزراعيه والمصنعه اهمها:\n\nالصابون النابلسي: ازدهرت صناعه الصابون في نابلس واشتهر صابونها الذي يصنع من زيت الزيتون حتى اصبحت مصابنها جزءاً من تراث المدينه. كانت صناعه الصابون احد اعمده الاقتصاد النابلسي ووصل عدد المصابن الى اكثر من ثلاثين مصبنه، توقف معظمها عن العمل بفعل اغلاق الاسواق الخارجيه وغياب الابتكار والتجديد.\nالحلويات النابلسيه: اهم حلوياتها على الاطلاق الكنافه النابلسيه الشهيره في كل انحاء المشرق العربي وتركيا. دخلت نابلس موسوعه غينيس للارقام القياسيه باكبر طبق (صدر) كنافه في 18 تموز 2009. تشتهر نابلس ايضاً بالمدلوقه والحلاوه المصنوعه من السمسم والكلاج والقطايف والفطير وحلاوه الزلابيه اضافه الى الحلويات الشاميه مثل البقلاوه.\nمن المُنتجات الاخرى التي تمتاز بها نابلس عن غيرها الجبن النابلسي والطحينه والحلاوه والقزحه، والاخيره عباره عن مائع اسود اللون يستخلص من حبه البركه، يؤكل غمساً وله استعمالات طبيه مهمه.\n\nالزراعه في محافظه نابلس\nتساهم الزراعه بنسبه قليله من الدخل، ويتركز الانتاج الزراعي على سفوح الجبال وفي الاغوار وتعتمد على مياه الامطار والري في الاغوار. فيها العديد من المزارع لتنميه الثروه الحيوانيه.\nتعد نابلس مركز زراعه الزيتون في فلسطين، ولهذا ازدهرت فيها صناعه الصابون النابلسي المطبوخ من زيت الزيتون. اضافه الى الزيتون، تحيط بنابلس بساتين الرمان واللوز والخوخ والمشمش والدراق. تزرع الخضراوات والحمضيات المرويه في الغور حيث تقل اخطار الصقيع. كانت منطقه نابلس تشتهر ايضاً بزراعه القطن، الا ان هذا المحصول اختفى تقريباً الان من منطقه نابلس، ولكنه لا زال يزرع في السهل الساحلي.\nتشتهر المدينه ايضاً بمنتجات زراعيه خاصه مثل الزعتر النابلسي وتعرف بمنتجاتها الجبليه مثل البابونج والميرميه. صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات واسعه من اراضي المحافظه واقامت عليها 43 مستوطنه مما ادى الى انحسار مساحه المراعي الطبيعيه.\n\nالخدمات الصحيه\nفيها مشفيان حكوميان اولهما المستشفى الوطني الذي يٌقدم خدمات في تخصص علم الاورام. بني هذا المستشفى عام 1910 ويقع في وسط المدينه. ثاني المستشفيات الحكوميه مستشفى رفيديا الجراحي الذي يقع في غرب المدينه ويُعد اكبر مستشفى في المدينه. يوجد ايضاً مشفيان خاصان غير ربحيين هما المستشفى الانجيلي العربي وهو الاقدم في المدينه حيث انشيء عام 1900 ومستشفى جمعيه الاتحاد النسائي العربي.. من المشافي الخاصه الربحيه المستشفى العربي التخصصي ومستشفى نابلس التخصصي الذي اسس عام 2001، ويقدم خدمات اختصاصيه في جراحه القلب المفتوح وقثطره شريانيه وراب الوعاء. بعد انشاء كليه الطب في جامعه النجاح انشيء مستشفى النجاح الوطني الجامعي وهو اول مستشفى جامعي في فلسطين.\nاضافه الى ما تقدم، هناك مستوصفات خيريه تقدم خدمات الطوارئ والاسعافات الاوليه مثل مستوصف الرحمه ومستوصف التضامن التابع لجمعيه التضامن الخيريه ومركز الرازي الطبي ومركز الامل للتاهيل. هناك ايضاً العديد من العيادات الطبيه الحكوميه او التابعه لوكاله غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين او الاونروا، وخاصه في مخيمات اللاجئين. في عام 2010، بلغ معدل السكان لكل مركز رعايه صحيه 5,486 مواطن وهو الرقم الاصغر مُقارنه مع باقي المدن الفلسطينيه. ويتمتع المواطن النابلسي بخاصيه التامين الصحي الذي يتم تامينه من جهه الحكومه (نظام التامين الصحي الحكومي) والتامين الصحي الخاص والمنظمات الغير حكوميه والاونروا ايضًا ويصل عدد العائلات التي تستفيد من هذا التامين 19,051 عائله.\n\nالخدمات البلديه\nفي عام 1997، تم ربط 18,003 منزل بالشبكه العامه للكهرباء اي ما يعادل 99,7% من المدينه. قبل بناء هذه الشبكه عام 1957 كان التزود بالكهرباء يتم عن طريق بعض المولدات الخاصه. بالاضافه ان الشبكه تمد 18 بلده وقريه بجوار المدينه بالكهرباء عن طريق نفس الشبكه.\nوترتبط 93% من منازل المدينه بنظام الصرف الصحي و7% عن طريق الحُفر الامتصاصيه. واُنشئ نظام الصرف الصحي في اوائل الخمسينات، بالاضافه الى ارتباط مخيم بلاطه ومخيم عسكر ومخيم عين بيت الماء. وتوفر بلديه نابلس المياه الصحيه عن طريق الانابيب لجميع المنازل في المدينه. وقد قامت السلطات البريطانيه بتاسيس شبكه المياه عام 1932، وتتزود بالمياه من الابار الاربعه المجاوره للمدينه في: دير شرف، الفارعه، وادي الباذان و‌اودلا.\n\nاطفائيه البلديه\nتم تاسيس اطفائيه بلديه نابلس عام 1958. حيث تالفت اول فرقه اطفاء من خمسه افراد مع سياره اطفاء واحده، حتى عام 1986 كانت مسؤوله عن منطقه شمال الضفه الغربيه كاملهً. ولكن اليوم تقتصر خدماتها فقط في نابلس. في عام 2007، بلغ عدد السيارات المُستعمله لاطفاء الحرائق 20 سياره و70 فرد. خلال الفتره الواقعه ما بين 1997 و2006، قامت باطفاء 15,346 حريق.\n\nالطرق والمواصلات\nينقسم نظام الطرق والمواصلات في نابلس كما هو الحال في باقي مناطق الضفه الغربيه الى قسمين رئيسيين، واحد لاستخدام المواطنين الفلسطينيين والاخر لاستخدام المستوطنين الاسرائيليين. تصل مساحه الطرق الرئيسيه التي تربط مدينه نابلس بالقرى المُحيطه بها الى 365.8 كم 2، بينما تصل مساحه الطرق الفرعيه التي تربطها بالقرى الى 313.2 كم 2. ومنذ توقيع اتفاقيه اوسلو بين السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه والجانب الاسرائيلي في ايلول سبتمبر عام 1995 عملت اسرائيل على انشاء نظام طرق خاص يربط مستوطنات الضفه الغربيه ببعضها البعض، ويضمن مرورا امنا لمستوطني الضفه الغربيه. وقد ادى نظام الطرق هذا الى تقسيم الاراضي الزراعيه في الضفه الغربيه وبعثرتها. وقد وصل طول هذه الطرق الى 39,699 كم مربع حتى نهايه شهر مارس من العام 1996.\nتعد المركبات في نابلس اهم وسائل النقل، بل تكاد تكون الوحيده التي يعتمد عليها سكان نابلس للتنقل برًا من والى المناطق المختلفه داخل الوطن والمدن المجاوره. حيث تبلغ عدد السيارات 20.397 منها 15.507 سياره خاصه و1.490 سياره اجره و121 حافله عموميه. ويعتبر متوسط سنه انتاج السياره منخفضًا في المدينه حيث يبلغ عدد السيارات التي تم تصنيعها (قبل عام 1997) 9.540 سياره اي ما يقارب نصفها.\n\nالحياه الثقافيه والتراث\nتعتبر نابلس من اغنى المدن الفلسطينيه ثقافياً وتراثياً. من الالقاب التي عرفت بها نابلس «عش العلماء» ويعود سبب التسميه الى كون نابلس مركزاً علمياً وادبياً ونظراً لظهور الكثير من العلماء والادباء والشعراء منها على مدى كثير من العصور.\n\nشعراؤها وادباؤها\nبرز منها الكثير من اعلام الفكر والشعر والادب. من اشهر شعرائها ابراهيم طوقان شاعر فلسطين وشقيقته فدوى طوقان وحلمي الزواتي وعبد اللطيف عقل وليلى علوش وعلي الخليلي ومحمد مهيب جبر ومن ادبائها في القرن العشرين عادل زعيتر وقدري طوقان ومحمد عزه دروزه وثريا ملحس واكرم زعيتر.\n\nمؤسسات التعليم العالي والمراكز الثقافيه\nتحتضن نابلس جامعه النجاح الوطنيه الاكبر في الضفه الغربيه والتي تضم عشرين كليه. توجد في المدينه ايضاً كليه الروضه للعلوم المهنيه اضافهً الى مراكز ثقافيه مثل المنتدى التنويري الثقافي الفلسطيني والنادي الثقافي الاجتماعي ومركز حواء الثقافي وملتقى بلاطه الثقافي والمركز الثقافي الفرنسي وفرع للمجلس الثقافي البريطاني. كان في المدينه ثلاث دور سينما اغلقت خلال الانتفاضات المتعاقبه منذ 1989، وقد افتتحت عام 2009 دار جديده للسينما، اغلقت ابوابها عام 2019. وتعد مكتبه بلديه نابلس العامه اقدم واكبر المكتبات في الضفه الغربيه حيث انشئت عام 1960.\nوفقًا ل الجهاز المركزي للاحصاء الفلسطيني، في عام 1997، بلغ عدد الطلاب 44,926 (41.2٪ في المدارس الابتدائيه، 36.2٪ في المدرسه الثانويه، و22.6٪ في المدرسه الثانويه). في عام 2006، بلغ عدد المدارس 234 مدرسه و93,925 طالبًا وطالبه في محافظه نابلس؛ منها 196 تابعه لمديريه التربيه والتعليم الفلسطينيه و24 مدرسه خاصه و14 مدرسه تابعه ل الاونروا.\n\nالحركه النسويه\nفي عام 1921، تاسست في نابلس جمعيه الاتحاد النسائي العربي التي كانت اول جمعيه نسائيه غير دينيه في فلسطين (سبقتها ثلاث جمعيات ارثوذكسيه في عكا ويافا والقدس)، وهي لا تزال نشطه حتى الان واسست الكثير من المراكز والنشاطات منها مشفى ومعهد تمريض ومراكز تعليم مهني وناد ثقافي وروضه اطفال.\n\nالمتاحف\nانشئ في نابلس متحف القصبه في موقع غني بالاثار الرومانيه داخل المدينه القديمه. هناك ايضاً متحف سامري اقيم على قمه جبل جرزيم عام 1997 لالقاء الضوء على ديانه وتراث السامريين.\n\nالانتاج التلفزيوني ومحطات البث التلفزيوني\nتم في نابلس عام 2005 انتاج مسلسل تلفزيوني يعالج الكثير من القضايا الاجتماعيه وكان اسم المسلسل «براويز» من انتاج تلفزيون اسيا ـ نابلس، كذلك انتج مسلسل تلفزيوني اجتماعي اخر عام 2008 حمل عنوان «لهون حلو». فيها سبع محطات تلفزه محليه اهمها واولها تلفزيون نابلس وخمس محطات اذاعه محليه تبث على موجات اف ام، وهي تؤثر بشكل فاعل بطرح قضايا تخص المدينه وسكانها، من ابرز هذه الاذاعات راديو شباب اف ام، راديو طريق المحبه، اذاعه جامعه النجاح الوطنيه واذاعه القران الكريم.\n\nالزي الشعبي\nيشبه الزي النسائي القديم المعروف لمدينه نابلس الى حد كبير الزي النسائي لمدينه دمشق، والذي يتكون من يشمك وغطوه وكاب او ملايه. والحال كذلك بالنسبه للزي الرجالي الذي كان يتكون من الشروال والطربوش.\n\nالفن التشكيلي\nاقيمت في مدينه نابلس اضخم جداريه في فلسطين بمساحه 550 متر مربع عند مفترق جامع السلام غرب المدينه. كما اقيم في مدينه نابلس حديثا غالري فني يهتم بالفن التشكيلي بكافه انواعه وهو غالري تهامه.\n\nالرياضه\nتوجد في المدينه العديد من الانديه الرياضيه اهمها نادي حطين ونادي اتحاد نابلس ونادي عيبال وشباب نابلس، اضافه الى انديه صغيره مثل نادي اهلي بلاطه ونادي التضامن ونادي جبل النار ونادي اسكان الموظفين. اضافهً الى ذلك، يوجد مركز للشباب في كل مخيم للاجئين (كبلاطه وعسكر وعين بيت الماء). فيها ملعب بلدي لكره القدم هو الاقدم في فلسطين حيث اسس عام 1950. جرت توسعته واعاده تاهيله ليتسع ل4,000 من المتفرجين.\n\nالحديقه النباتيه\nاقيمت اول حديقه نباتيه تعليميه وبحثيه في فلسطين في قريه تل الواقعه في ضواحي نابلس. اشرف على هذا المشروع ونفذه مركز ابحاث التنوع الحيوي والبيئه «بيرك» ويقع مقره في ذات القريه. تحتوي الحديقه على اشجار الحور، عروس الغابه، الخروب، البطم، الجكرندا، الطلح الناعم، السنديان، العبهر، الصنوبر، الكينا، التين، الزيزفون السوري، الورود، بالاضافه الى حديقه مائيه وحديقه صخريه.\n\nاهميتها الدينيه\nاخرج ابن ابي شيبه عن كعب الاحبار قال: \n\n هي من اهم المدن قداسه وخاصه عند اليهود والنصارى. يقال ان النبي ادم سجد فيها على جبل جرزيم. هي الموقع الكنعاني الاول الذي ذكرته التوراه وفيه بنى ابراهيم اول هيكل لدى قدومه من حلب. اضافه الى ابراهيم، سكنها انبياء اهمهم اسحاق ويعقوب. ويعتقد اليهود ان ابراهيم همّ بذبح اسحاق على جبل جرزيم. مر بها المسيح حيث سقته المراه السامريه من بئر يعقوب. يوجد فيها ايضاً قبر يوسف وبظاهرها قبور انبياء اخرين.\nهناك 17 معلما اسلاميّا في المدينه، و11 مسجدًا في المدينه القديمه. تمّ انشاء 9 مساجد من هذه المذكوره قبل القرن الخامس عشر. تحوي نابلس، بالاضافه لدور العباده الاسلاميه، كنيسه للروم الارثوذكس مكرسه للقديس جوستين الشهيد، المبنيه عام 1898، وكنيسًا للسامريين، لا يزال يُستعمل من قبل تابعي هذه الديانه.\n\nالمساجد\nنابلس مدينه المساجد، فمنذ ان دخلها الاسلام وهي جاده في بناء المساجد التي بنى معظمها الموسرون من اهلها حيث تفيد احصائيه من عام 1997م بان عدد المساجد في مدينه نابلس وحدها دون قراها بلغ 49 مسجدًا  منها ما هو قديم جداً مثل جامع الخضراء، الذي يمتد عمره الى بدايه العهد الاسلامي،جامع التينه، جامع البيك، الجامع الصلاحي الكبير الذي كان كاتدرائيه، جامع الساطون، جامع النصر، المسجد العمري، جامع المساكين، المسجد الحنبلي، جامع الانبياء، جامع الخضر، مسجد العامود. وهناك عدد كبير من المساجد الحديثه.\nتوجد في نابلس لجنه زكاه تعتبر الاكبر في الضفه الغربيه حيث تقوم على اعاله الاف الاسر والايتام وطلاب العلم في نابلس وقراها وتشرف على عده مشاريع استثماريه ضخمه متعدده الاغراض.\n\nالكنائس والاديره\nتمتاز نابلس بتسامحها الديني، وهذا يفسر كثره الكنائس وتنوعها وكذلك الاديره المسيحيه فيها. ومن اشهر الكنائس واقدمها في نابلس كنيسه الارثوذكس في المدينه القديمه، والكنيسه الارثوذكسيه المُقامه فوق بئر يعقوب. ومن اشهر اديرتها دير فنشر قرب جامع الخضر، ودير اللاتين قرب المقبره الغربيه. وهناك موقع شرقي المدينه يسمى خله الرهبان.\n\nاثار ومعالم\nلا تزال مجموعه من المباني الاثريه والتاريخيه الجميله الممثله لمختلف الفترات التاريخيه السابقه التي مرت على نابلس قائمه حتى اليوم داخل المدينه، فبالاضافه الى مدينه شكيم، لا يزال هناك ثلاثه عشر اثراً رومانياً من ابرزها المسرح والمدرج وميدان سباق الخيل، كما ان هناك خمسه وستين اثراً لمعالم التراث الحضاري الاسلامي موزعه على المساجد، المقامات، الزوايا، الخانات، القصور، الاسبله، المدارس وغير ذلك. ومما يؤسف له ان هذه الاثار قد تعرضت للتدمير والهدم والتخريب الوحشي على يد الاسرائيليين اثناء هجومهم على البلده القديمه في نابلس عام 2002.\n\nبوابات نابلس\nيروي مؤرخو المدينه ان نابلس كان لها ثماني عشره بوابه، زال معظمها جراء التوسع العمراني الذي شهدته ابتداءً من القرن التاسع عشر. ومنها: البوابه الشرقيه، البوابه الغربيه، بوابه الدير، بوابه الشيخ مسلم، بوابه ادريس، بوابه سوق الحدادين، بوابه البيك وسط المدينه القديمه، بوابه الوكاله.\n\nالمعالم من العهدين الكنعاني والروماني\nتظهر الاثار الرومانيه على اطراف المدينه القديمه، وبعض المعالم في البلده القديمه ترجع الى العهد البيزنطي والصليبي. من الاثار الكنعانيه والرومانيه المهمه في نابلس:\n\nسبسطيه: مدينه اثريه فيها مدارج رومانيه وشارع اعمده. تقع على بعد كيلومترات قليله شمال غرب نابلس.\nشكيم: مدينه كنعانيه قديمه. بعض جدرانها لا تزال قائمهً الى اليوم في الطرف الشرقي من مدينه نابلس.\nمعبد جوبيتر او زيوس: ويقع في تل الراس في جبل جرزيم (الطور). اُسس كمعبد للالهه زيوس في القرن الثاني للميلاد وقد تم اكتشافه عام 1930.\nمدرج سباق الخيل في ساحه الشهداء (ميدان الحسين سابقاً) وسط مدينه نابلس.\nالمدرج الروماني في راس العين: ويتسع لاكثر من الف شخص، وهو اكبر المسارح المكتشفه في فلسطين.\nالشارع الروماني: اكتشفت اجزاء منه تحت مدرسه ظافر المصري في حاره القيساريه.\nمقبره عسكر البيزنطيه.\nالمقبره الرومانيه الغربيه: وتقع على اطراف المدينه على الطريق المتجه غربًا نحو الساحل الفلسطيني.\nبئر يعقوب: وهو البئر الذي شرب منه يسوع على يد المراه السامريه بحسب التقاليد المسيحيه، واقيم فوقه دير ارثوذكسي، ولا يزال عامراً بالمياه الصالحه للشرب.\nقبر يوسف: هو مقام يعتقد ان القبر الموجود فيه يحتوي رفات النبي يوسف بن يعقوب التي حملت من مصر حسب التوراه،  ولذلك استولى عليه اليهود عام 1967 وجعلوه مقاماً مقدساً لديهم ونقطهً عسكريه قبل ان يطردهم سكان نابلس بالقوه عام 2000.\n\nقناه جر المياه الرومانيه: اقام الرومان هذه القناه في القرن الثاني الميلادي واكتشفت حديثاً على عمق 30 متراً تحت الارض تحت اقسام من المدينه القديمه عند بناء مدرسه ظافر المصري في حاره القيساريه. يُعتقد ان هذه القناه تجر مياه الشرب من ينابيع جبل جرزيم ضمن شبكه من الخزانات والابار،  ولا تزال المياه تتدفق في هذه القناه. تم ترميم جزء منها وفتحه للزوار من قبل بلديه المدينه قبل عده سنوات.\nاربع كنائس بيزنطيه حولت الى مساجد.\nاثار جبل جرزيم. يوجد على قمه الجبل معبد يوناني وكنيسه بيزنطيه مثمنه الاضلاع وقلعه صليبيه ومقام اسلامي اضافه الى خزانات مياه واساسات ابنيه.\nتله صوفر.\n\nقبور الانبياء في عورتا. فيها قبر النبي العزير في مغاره وكذلك قبر يوشع بن نون خادم النبي موسى ومفضل ابن عم النبي هارون.\n\nالمعالم من العهد الاسلامي\nتتمثل اهم الاثار الاسلاميه في احياء المدينه القديمه في نابلس، وهي الياسمينه، القريون، الحبله، القيساريه، العقبه، الغرب، القصبه الذي يمثل شريان المدينه القديمه ومركزها التجاري.\nتحتوي نابلس على 2850 بناءً تاريخيًا من منازل وقصور عائليه، و18 معلماً اسلامياً و17 سبيلاً. يعود تاريخ انشاء العديد من الاماكن التاريخيه المهمه الى العهد الاسلامي وبالاخص العثماني مثل:\n\nبرج الساعه في باب الساحه\nخان التجار القديم\nخان التجار الجديد\nخان الوكاله الغربيه\nالمدرسه الرشاديه او المدرسه الفاطميه\nقصر النمر\nالمناره\nمستشفى الوطني الحكومي\nالمستشفى الانجيلي (المبنيان القديمان)\nسجن النساء التركي\nالسجن (القشله)\nسرايا الحكم التركي\nدار المفتي\nالوكاله الفروخيه\nمحطه ضخ مياه القريون\nالبرج الصليبي\nجسر القطار قرب حدائق جمال عبد الناصر ومحطه القطار\nالمدرسه الهاشميه (هدمت)\nالمحكمه الشرعيه.\nاضافه الى ذلك، تضم المدينه العديد من الاثار والمعالم القديمه، منها تسعه مساجد اثريه، اربع منها كانت كنائس بيزنطيه بالاصل وحولت الى مساجد، وخمسه مساجد بنيت في بدايه العهد الاسلامي، وضريح يعود الى الفتره الايوبيه، وكنيسه من القرن السابع عشر وعشرات المصابن.\nيقع مقام رجال العامود على سفح جبل جرزيم الشمالي، ويعود تاريخه الى عام 1396، ويتكون من سبع غرف متلاصقه يعتقد انها كانت مسكن عامود النور وعائلته، ويوجد في الغرف الوسطى قبور يعتقد ان اصحاب المقام قد دفنوا فيها لاحقًا، وله فناء داخلي وسور، وفي جزئه الشمالي الغربي مسجد صغير تعلوه قبه حجريه.\n\nالحمامات التركيه\nما زالت الحمامات التركيه في نابلس شاهدهً على قدم هذه المدينه وعراقتها. كان عدد الحمامات التركيه في نابلس اكبر من ايه مدينه اخرى في فلسطين، حيث كانت تضم عشره حمامات تركيه  من اصل 38 في كل فلسطين. مع التطور العمراني ووصول المياه الجاريه الى البيوت، تضاءلت اهميه الحمامات العامه فهجر بعضها او تضرر بسبب الاهمال بينما تحولت حمامات اخرى الى مرافق مختلفه مثل حمام الخليلي، حمام الريشه، حمام الدرجه، حمام القاضي، حمام التميمي، وحمام النساء. تم خلال السنوات العشر الماضيه تجديد بعض الحمامات التركيه مثل حمام السمره وحمام الشفاء. واضافه الى وظيفتها الاساسيه، اصبحت هذه الحمامات تشكل ملتقيات للسكان من مختلف الاعمار حيث تشهد اقامه فعاليات ثقافيه وتراثيه.\n\nالتخريب الاسرائيلي للمعالم الاثريه في نابلس\nتعرضت المباني والمعالم التاريخيه في نابلس لاضرار كبيره من قبل الاحتلال الاسرائيلي، حيث دمر 149 معلماً من هذه المعالم بالكامل بينما تعرض 2000 معلم، ابرزها جامع الخضراء الذي يقدر عمره بـ 400 سنه، وخان الوكاله  لاضرار متنوعه اثناء عمليات الجيش الاسرائيلي في المدينه منذ بدايه الانتفاضه الثانيه عام 2000 وخاصه اثناء عمليتها الكبرى في نابلس في نيسان 2002. واصاب الضرر قصورًا اثريه ومساجد ومصابن واسواق.\n\nدور نابلس في النضال القومي العربي والوطني الفلسطيني\nكانت نابلس على الدوام مركزاً للنضال الوطني والقومي حيث لعبت دوراً كبيراً في مقاومه الغزاه. وحسب قسطنطين بازيلي فان «جبليي نابلس هم اكثر القبائل السوريه ضراوه ونزوعاً للقتال.»  لعب مثقفو نابلس واعيانها ادورا كبيره في الكفاح القومي. على سبيل المثال، كان عدد الاجمال للاعضاء في المنظمات والانديه القوميه التي شكلت حتى نهايه الحرب العالميه الاولى 126 عضوا (مثلوا سوريه والعراق)، كان منهم ثلاثه عشر عضوا من نابلس ومنطقتها، وهو اعلى تمثيل من فلسطين متبوعا بالقدس التي مثلها تسعه اعضاء. كان معظم هؤلاء ناشطين في جمعيه العربيه الفتاه وعلى راسهم عوني عبد الهادي ومحمد عزه دروزه. شارك مندوبون عن نابلس في المؤتمر السوري العام الذي عقد في دمشق عام 1920 والقى محمد عزه دروزه مقررات المؤتمر التي اعلنت استقلال سوريه بحدودها الطبيعيه ونادت بفيصل بن الحسين ملكا عليها.\nمن اهم الاحداث التي شهدتها نابلس المؤتمر الفلسطيني الخامس من 20 الى 24 اب 1922 والذي اعلن الفلسطينيون خلاله رفض الانتداب واصدار طوابع عليها شعارات فلسطينيه ومقاطعه اليهود في البيع والشراء. لمتابعه المؤتمر عقد في نابلس مؤتمر اخر بتاريخ 18 ايلول 1931 سمي بمؤتمر التسليح، حيث طالب بالاستقلال والوحده العربيه ودعا الى مقاطعه حكومه الانتداب وتسليح عرب فلسطين ان لم تستجب لذلك.\n\nنابلس في الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه\nتعتبر مدينه نابلس اكثر المدن الفلسطينيه تعرضًا للحصار والضربات العسكريه من قبل الجيش الاسرائيلي خلال الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه ابتداءً من العام 2000. ادى الحصار المستمر للمدينه وصعوبه تبادل البضائع الى تدهور مكانه المدينه كمركز اقتصادي، وادى الى ارتفاع نسب البطاله كثيرًا، مما ادى الى هجره العديد من سكانها الى الخارج او الى مدن اخرى خاصه رام الله. تصف اسرائيل المدينه بانها «مصنع للارهابيين»، وقامت قوات الجيش الاسرائيلي بعده عمليات عسكريه واسعه النطاق في المدينه او عمليات شملت عده مناطق من ضمنها مدينه نابلس من اشهرها عمليه الدرع الواقي عام 2002 وذلك نتيجه عدد الاستشهاديين الذين خرجوا منها. كانت نابلس الاكثر تضرراً من بين المحافظات الفلسطينيه على صعيد الخسائر الاقتصاديه حيث سجلت 2630 منشاه غير عامله من بين العدد الكلي للمنشات (17,167) او ما نسبته 15% من المنشات فيها وفق نتائج تعداد 2007،  وهذه اعلى نسبه سجلت في فلسطين.\n\nاعلام نابلس\nعلى الصعيد القومي\nخرج من نابلس شعراء وكتاب ورجال سياسه واقتصاد منهم من تبوا مناصب رفيعه على مستوى فلسطين والاردن

          "summary": "نَابُلُس إحدى أكبر المدن الفلسطينية سكانًا وأهمها موقعًا. وهي مقر جامعة النجاح الوطنية أكبر الجامعات الفلسطينية. تعتبر نابلس مركزاً لشمال الضفة الغربية إضافةً إلى كونها عاصمة لمحافظة نابلس التي تضم 56 قرية ويُقدر عدد سكانها بقرابة (388,321) نسمة حسب إحصاءات عام 2017. تُعرف أيضا بأسماء جبل النار ودمشق الصغرى وعش العلماء وملكة فلسطين غير المتوجة. لعبت المدينة أدوارًا مهمة خلال النزاعات في بلاد الشام، ويعتقد أنها كانت أكبر مدينة في فلسطين في أواسط القرن الثامن عشر والنصف الأول من القرن التاسع عشر.\nفي القرنين الخامس والسادس للميلاد أدّى نزاع بين سكان المدينة من السامريين والمسيحيين إلى بروز عدد من الانتفاضات السامرية ضد الحكم البيزنطي، قبل أن تقوم الإمبراطورية بإخماد ثوراتهم هذه بالعنف، مما أدى لاضمحلال عددهم في المدينة.\nفتح العرب المسلمون، في زمن خلافة أبي بكر الصديق، هذه المدينة وباقي فلسطين وبلاد الشام، وفي هذا العهد عُرّب اسمها ليصبح نابلس بدلاً من نيابوليس، وازداد عدد المسلمين من سكانها وأخذت بعض من كنائسها ومعابدها السامرية تتحول إلى مساجد شيئاً فشيئاً، ثم سقطت نابلس تحت الحكم الصليبي عام 1099 قبل أن تعود لحكم المسلمين الأيوبيين والمماليك بعدهم.\nأصبحت نابلس عاصمة سنجق نابلس في العهد العثماني، وكانت في هذه الفترة سنجقا تابعا لإيالة دمشق ثم لإيالة صيدا (التي خلفت إيالة عكا وأجزاء من إيالة دمشق) وأخيرًا ولاية بيروت وفي آخر تقسيم إداري عثماني خضعت المدينة للحكم المصري الذي دام تسع سنوات في بلاد الشام، في العقد الرابع من القرن التاسع عشر، وقبل أن تعود إلى الحكم العثماني. احتلها البريطانيون عندما انهزمت الدولة العثمانية في الحرب العالمية الأولى وخضعت فلسطين للانتداب البريطاني. وسقطت نابلس تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي عام 1967 حينها سقطت الضفة الغربية بأكملها.\nتشتهر المدينة القديمة بصناعة الصابون، وبالكنافة النابلسية، التي تعتبر من أشهر الحلويات الشرقية في بلاد الشام، بالإضافة إلى بعض المنتجات الزراعية مثل الزعتر النابلسي والجبن النابلسي.",

          "title": "Gaza City",
          "content": "Gaza City, often simply called Gaza, is a city in the Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Gaza Governorate. Located on the Mediterranean coast, 76.6 kilometres (47.6 mi) southwest of Jerusalem, it was home to Palestine's only port. With a population of 590,481 people as of 2017, Gaza City was the most populous city in Palestine until the Gaza war caused most of the population to be displaced.\nInhabited since at least the 15th century BC, Gaza City has been dominated by different peoples and empires throughout its history. The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years. Under the Roman Empire, Gaza City experienced relative peace and its Mediterranean port flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in the Palestine region to be conquered by the Rashidun army and quickly developed into a centre of Islamic law. However, by the time the Crusader states were established in 1099, Gaza City was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza City experienced several hardships—from Mongol raids to severe flooding and locust swarms, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza City and the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza City was established in 1893.\nGaza City fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine. As a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Its population rose sharply after the influx of Palestinian refugees displaced by the war and the ensuing Nakba. Gaza City was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, and in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly created Palestinian National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas, resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. The Gaza Strip was then subject to an Israeli-led, Egyptian-supported blockade. Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah Border Crossing in 2011 to pedestrians. The city has been largely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes since the Gaza war began in October 2023, including a large amount of significant cultural heritage in the Old City of Gaza.\nThe primary economic activities of Gaza City are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the blockade and recurring conflicts have put the economy under severe pressure. The majority of Gaza City's Palestinian inhabitants are Muslim, although there is also a Christian minority. Gaza City has a very young population, with roughly 75% under the age of 25. As of November 2025, many residents have fled or been evacuated to the Southern Gaza Strip, or killed as a result of Israel's actions in the north. Therefore, previous recorded or estimated population numbers have become outdated.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Gaza first appears in the military records of Thutmose III of New Kingdom of Egypt in the 15th century BC, and was mentioned in the Amarna correspondence as Āl Ḫazzati and other variant spellings. In Neo-Assyrian sources, reflecting the late Philistine period, it was known as Ḫāzat. It is clear that the name originates from none of these languages, however.\nBased on the city's Hebrew name, עַזָּה ʻAzzā, a common folk etymology insists the name stems from the Semitic root ע-ז-ז‎ ʻayin-zayin-zayin, from which words related to strength and fierceness are derived, but this is unlikely. The ע‎ in the root ע-ז-ז‎ corresponds to a Proto-Semitic *ʻ sound (compare Hebrew עַז ʻaz with Arabic عَزَّ ʻazza, both meaning \"to be strong, powerful, mighty\"), while it is clear from city's name in Arabic (غَزَّة, Ġazza), Koine Greek (Γάζα, Gáza), and Egyptian (gꜣḏꜣtw) that the name of Gaza was likely originally pronounced with an initial *ġ (/ʁ/) sound, and thus cannot have been from the same ע-ז-ז‎ root as עַז ʻaz.\nHistorically, Muslims often referred to the city as Ġazzat Hāšim in honor of Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, the great-grandfather of Muhammad who, according to Islamic tradition, is buried in the city.\n\nHistory\nGaza's history of habitation dates back 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world. Located on the Mediterranean coastal route between North Africa and the Levant, for most of its history it served as a key entrepôt of southern Palestine and an important stopover on the spice trade route traversing the Red Sea.\n\nEarly Bronze\nSettlement in the region of Gaza dates back to the ancient Egyptian fortress built in Canaanite territory at Tell es-Sakan, to the south of present-day Gaza. The site was inhabited until about 3000 BC. In about 2600 BC, the settlement was re-founded and this time inhabited by the Canaanites. Tell es-Sakan was abandoned again about 2300 BC.\n\nMiddle Bronze\nAnother urban center known as Tell el-Ajjul began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed.\n\nLate Bronze\nDuring the reign of Thutmose III (r. 1479–1425 BC), the city became a stop on the King's Highway, a crucial trade route of the Levant, and was mentioned in the 14th-century Amarna letters as Azzatu. Gaza later served as Egypt's administrative capital in Canaan. Gaza remained under Egyptian control for 350 years until it was conquered by the Philistines in the 12th century BC.\n\nIron Age\nIn the 12th century BC Gaza became part of the Philistine \"pentapolis\". Gaza achieved relative independence and prosperity under the Persian Empire.\n\nHellenistic period\nAlexander the Great besieged Gaza, the last city to resist his conquest on his path to Egypt, for five months before capturing it 332 BC; the inhabitants were either killed or taken captive. Alexander brought in local Bedouins to populate Gaza and organized the city into a polis (or \"city-state\").\n\nUnder the Seleucid Empire, Seleucus I Nicator or one of his successors renamed Gaza as Seleucia to control the surrounding area against the Ptolemies. Greek culture consequently took root and Gaza earned a reputation as a flourishing center of Hellenistic learning and philosophy. During the Third War of the Diadochi, Ptolemy I Soter defeated Demetrius I Poliorcetes in the Battle of Gaza in 312 BC. In 277 BC, following Ptolemy II's successful campaign against the Nabataeans, the Ptolemaic fortress of Gaza took control of the spice trade with Gerrha and South Arabia.\nGaza experienced another siege in 96 BC by the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus, who \"utterly overthrew\" the city, killing 500 senators who had fled into the temple of Apollo.\n\nRoman period\nJosephus notes that Gaza was resettled under the rule of Antipater, who cultivated friendly relations with Gazans, Ascalonites and neighboring cities after being appointed governor of Idumaea by Jannaeus.\nRebuilt after it was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 63 BC under the command of Pompey Magnus, Gaza then became a part of the Roman province of Judaea. It was targeted by Jewish forces during their rebellion against Roman rule in 66 and was partially destroyed. It nevertheless remained an important city, even more so after the destruction of Jerusalem during the First Jewish–Roman War. Following this, and again at the end of the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), captives were sold into slavery in Gaza.\nThroughout the Roman period, Gaza was a prosperous city and received grants and attention from several emperors. A 500-member senate governed Gaza, and a diverse variety of Greeks, Romans, Phoenicians, Jews, Egyptians, Persians, and Bedouin populated the city. Gaza's mint issued coins adorned with the busts of gods and emperors. During his visit in 130 AD, Emperor Hadrian personally inaugurated wrestling, boxing, and oratorical competitions in Gaza's new stadium. The city was adorned with many pagan temples; the main cult being that of Marnas. Other temples were dedicated to Zeus, Helios, Aphrodite, Apollo, Athena and the local Tyche. Christianity began to spread throughout Gaza in 250 AD, including in the port of Maiuma.\nFirst evidence of a Bishop of Gaza is from early 4th century, when St. Sylvan served in that capacity.\n\nByzantine period\nFollowing the division of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century, Gaza remained under the control of the Eastern Roman Empire, which in turn became the Byzantine Empire. The city prospered and was an important center for southern Palestine. A Christian bishopric was established at Gaza. Conversion to Christianity in Gaza was accelerated under Porphyry of Gaza between 396 and 420. In 402, Theodosius II ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed, and four years later Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas. It was during this era that the Christian philosopher Aeneas of Gaza called Gaza, his hometown, \"the Athens of Asia.\" The large Gaza synagogue existed in the 6th century, according to excavations.\n\nEarly Islamic period\nIn c. 638 Gaza was captured by Arab Muslim forces under Amr ibn al-As, in the years following the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine. It was captured by Amr's forces about three years later. Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great-grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf was buried, Gaza was not destroyed and its inhabitants were not attacked by Amr's army despite the city's stiff and lengthy resistance, though its Byzantine garrison was massacred.\nThe arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought significant changes to Gaza; at first, some of its churches were transformed into mosques, including the present Great Mosque of Gaza (the oldest in the city). It was later rebuilt by Sultan Baybars, who endowed it with a huge manuscript library containing over 20,000 manuscripts in the 13th century. A large segment of the population swiftly adopted Islam, and Arabic became the official language. In 767 Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; he founded the Shafi'i school, one of the four major schools of fiqh (law) in Sunni Islam. \nSecurity, which was well-maintained during the early Muslim rule, was a key factor in Gaza's prosperity. Although alcohol was banned in Islam, the Jewish and Christian communities were allowed to maintain viticulture, and grapes, a major cash crop of the city, were exported, primarily to Egypt.\nBecause it bordered the Negev, Gaza was vulnerable to warring nomadic groups. It was destroyed at the end of the Qays–Yaman war (793–796) between two powerful tribes of Arabia. However, by the 10th century, the city had been rebuilt by the Abbasid Caliphate; during Abbasid rule, the geographer al-Maqdisi described Gaza as \"a large town lying on the highroad to Egypt on the border of the desert.\" In 978, the Fatimid Caliphate established an agreement with Alptakin, the Turkic ruler of Damascus, whereby the Fatimids would control Gaza and the land south of it, including Egypt, while Alptakin controlled the region north of the city.\n\nCrusader and Ayyubid periods\nThe Crusaders conquered Gaza in 1100 and King Baldwin III built a castle in the city for the Knights Templar in 1149. He also had the Great Mosque converted back into a church, the Cathedral of Saint John. In 1154, Arab traveller al-Idrisi wrote that Gaza \"is today very populous and in the hands of the Crusaders.\" In 1187 the Ayyubids, led by Sultan Saladin, captured Gaza and in 1191 destroyed the city's fortifications. Richard the Lionheart apparently refortified the city in 1192, but the walls were dismantled again as a result of the Treaty of Ramla in 1193. Ayyubid rule ended in 1260, after the Mongols under Hulagu Khan completely destroyed Gaza, which became his southernmost conquest.\n\nMamluk period\nFollowing Gaza's destruction by the Mongols, Muslim slave-soldiers based in Egypt known as the Mamluks began to administer the area. In 1277, the Mamluks made Gaza the capital of a province that bore its name, Mamlakat Ghazzah (Governorship of Gaza). This district extended along the coastal plain of Palestine from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea, and to the east as far as the Samarian highlands and the Hebron Hills. Other major towns in the province included Qaqun, Ludd, and Ramla. Gaza, which entered a period of tranquility under the Mamluks, was used by them as an outpost in their offensives against the Crusaders which ended in 1290. In 1294 an earthquake devastated Gaza, and five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that had been restored by the Mamluks. Syrian geographer al-Dimashqi described Gaza in 1300 as a \"city so rich in trees it looks like a cloth of brocade spread out upon the land.\" Under the governorship of Emir Sanjar al-Jawli, Gaza was transformed into a flourishing city and much of the Mamluk-era architecture dates back to his reign between 1311 and 1320 and again in 1342. In 1348 the bubonic plague spread to the city, killing the majority of its inhabitants and in 1352, Gaza suffered from a destructive flood, which was rare in that arid part of Palestine. However, when Arab writer Ibn Battuta visited the city in 1355, he noted that it was \"large and populous, and has many mosques.\" The Mamluks contributed to Gazan architecture by building mosques, Islamic colleges, hospitals, caravansaries, and public baths.\n\nThe Mamluks allowed Jews to return to the city, after being expelled by the Crusaders, and the Jewish community prospered during Mamluk rule. Towards the end of the Mamluk period, the Jewish community in Gaza was the third largest in Palestine, after the communities in Safad and Jerusalem. In 1481, an Italian Jewish traveller, Meshulam of Volterra, wrote of Gaza:It is a fine and renowned place, and its fruits are very renowned and good. Bread and good wine is to be found there, but only Jews make wine. Gaza has a circumference of four miles and no walls. It is about six miles from the sea and situated in a valley and on a hill. It has a population as numerous as the sands of the sea, and there are about fifty (sixty) Jewish householders, artisans. They have a small but pretty Synagogue, and vineyards and fields and houses.\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1516 Gaza—at the time, a small town with an inactive port, ruined buildings and reduced trade—was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman army quickly and efficiently crushed a small-scale uprising, and the local population generally welcomed them as fellow Sunni Muslims. The city was then made the capital of the Gaza Sanjak, part of the larger Province of Damascus. The Ridwan family, named after governor Ridwan Pasha, was the first dynasty to govern Gaza and would continue to rule the city for over a century. Under Ahmad ibn Ridwan, the city became a cultural and religious center as a result of the partnership between the governor and prominent Islamic jurist Khayr al-Din al-Ramli, who was based in the nearby town of al-Ramla.\nAccording to Theodore E. Dowling, writing in 1913, a Samaritan community existed in Gaza in 1584. They possessed a large synagogue and two bathhouses. \"One of them still bears the name \"the Bath of the Samaritans.\" It is believed the Samaritans were expelled from the city before the turn of the 16th century.\nDuring the rule of Husayn Pasha, strife between the settled population and the nearby Bedouin tribes was dramatically reduced, allowing Gaza to peacefully prosper. The Ridwan period is described as a golden age for Gaza, a time when it served as the virtual \"capital of Palestine.\" The Great Mosque was restored, and six other mosques constructed, while Turkish baths and market stalls proliferated. After the death of Musa Pasha, Husayn's successor, Ottoman officials were appointed to govern in place of the Ridwans. The Ridwan period was Gaza's last golden age during Ottoman rule. After the family was removed from office, the city gradually declined.\nStarting in the early 19th century, Gaza was culturally dominated by neighboring Egypt; Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered Gaza in 1832. American scholar Edward Robinson visited the city in 1838, describing it as a \"thickly populated\" town larger than Jerusalem, with its Old City lying upon a hilltop, while its suburbs laid on the nearby plain. The city benefited from trade and commerce because of its strategic position on the caravan route between Egypt and northern Syria as well as from producing soap and cotton for trade with the government, local Arab tribes, and the Bedouin of Wadi Arabah and Ma'an. The bazaars of Gaza were well-supplied and were noted by Robinson as \"far better\" than those of Jerusalem. Robinson noted that virtually all of Gaza's vestiges of ancient history and antiquity had disappeared due to constant conflict and occupation. By the mid-19th century, Gaza's port was eclipsed by the ports of Jaffa and Haifa, but it retained its fishing fleet.\nThe bubonic plague struck Gaza again in 1839 and the city, lacking political and economic stability, went into a state of stagnation. In 1840 Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza. The Ottomans won control of the territory, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. However, the battles brought about more death and destruction in Gaza.\nDuring the late Ottoman period, British ships docking in Gaza were loaded with barley, which was primarily intended for marketing in Scotland for whisky production. Due to the absence of a British consular agent, precise data on the financial value and quantities of the goods are unavailable.\n\nStages of conflict and occupation\nWhile leading the Allied Forces during World War I, the British won control of the city during the Third Battle of Gaza in 1917. After the war, Gaza was included in Mandatory Palestine. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion. New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains. International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction.\nIn the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, Gaza was assigned to be part of an Arab state in Palestine but was occupied by Egypt following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Gaza's growing population was augmented by an influx of refugees from nearby cities, towns and villages that were captured by Israel. In 1957, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser made a number of reforms in Gaza, which included expanding educational opportunities and the civil services, providing housing, and establishing local security forces.\n\nIsraeli occupation and colonisation\nGaza was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War following the defeat of the Egyptian Army. Frequent conflicts have erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city since the 1970s. The tensions led to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza was a center of confrontation during this uprising, and economic conditions in the city worsened.\n\nPalestinian control\nIn September 1993, the leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords. The agreement called for Palestinian administration of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. The PNA, led by Yasser Arafat, chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.In 2005, Israel withdrew its troops from the Gaza Strip and removed the thousands of Israelis who had settled in the territory. (See Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004.) Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organisation Fatah. On 25 January 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Hamas, recognized as a terror organization by most western countries, has de facto control of the city and Strip.\nIn March 2008, a coalition of human rights groups charged that the Israeli blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade of the Gaza Strip. In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians were killed in the conflict.\n\nIn November 2012, after a week of conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant groups, a ceasefire brokered by Egypt was announced on 21 November. In the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed, according to UN OCHA. During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, the 13-story Hanadi Tower, which contained a political office of Hamas, was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike.\n\nGaza War\nIn 2023, the city was again targeted during the Gaza war. On 2 November, the siege of Gaza City started. As of January 2024, Israel’s offensive has either damaged or destroyed 70–80% of all buildings in northern Gaza. Gaza was left largely deserted, with about only 300,000 people staying in the city. The remaining population was subjected to a humanitarian crisis and starvation brought on by the war.Seventy percent of the city was destroyed by airstrikes, and at least 64,964 people were killed in the Strip. Israel has been accused of committing a genocide of Palestinians in Gaza during the war, with South Africa initiating proceedings at the International Court of Justice against Israel. On 10 August 2025, five journalists were killed in Gaza city as a result of an Israeli air strike, including crew from Al-Jazeera Network.\n\nGeography\nCentral Gaza is situated on a low-lying and round hill with an elevation of 14 metres (46 ft) above sea level. Much of the modern city is built along the plain below the hill, especially to the north and east, forming Gaza's suburbs. The beach and the port of Gaza are located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) west of the city's nucleus and the space in between is entirely built up on low-lying hills.\nThe municipal jurisdiction of the city today constitutes about 45 square kilometres (17 sq mi). Gaza is 78 kilometres (48 mi) southwest of Jerusalem, 71 kilometres (44 mi) south of Tel Aviv, and 30 kilometres (19 mi) north of Rafah. Surrounding localities include Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun, and Jabalia to the north, and the village of Abu Middein, the refugee camp of Bureij, and the city of Deir al-Balah to the south.\nThe population of Gaza depends on groundwater as the only source for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears a small amount of water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. The Gaza Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer in the Gaza Strip and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most of the Gaza Strip, Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.\n\nA prominent hill southeast of Gaza, known as Tell al-Muntar, has an elevation of 270 feet (82 m) above sea level. For centuries it has been claimed as the place to which Samson brought the city gates of the Philistines. The hill is crowned by a Muslim shrine (maqam) dedicated to Ali al-Muntar. There are old Muslim graves around the surrounding trees, and the lintel of the doorway of the maqam has two medieval Arabic scriptures.\n\nOld City\nThe Old City forms the main part of Gaza's nucleus. It is roughly divided into two quarters; the northern Daraj Quarter (also known as the Muslim Quarter) and the southern Zaytun Quarter (which contained the Jewish and Christian quarters.) Most structures date from the Mamluk and Ottoman eras, and some were built on top of earlier structures. The ancient part of the Old City is about 1.6 square kilometres (0.62 sq mi).\nThere were seven historic gates to the Old City: Bab Asqalan (Gate of Ascalon), Bab al-Darum (Gate of Deir al-Balah), Bab al-Bahr (Gate of the Sea), Bab Marnas (Gate of Marnas), Bab al-Baladiyah (Gate of the Town), Bab al-Khalil (Gate of Hebron), and Bab al-Muntar (Gate of Tell al-Muntar).\nSome of the older buildings in Gaza's Old City use the ablaq style of decoration which features alternating layers of red and white masonry, prevalent in the Mamluk era. Daraj contains the Gold (Qissariya) Market as well as the Great Mosque of Gaza (oldest mosque in Gaza) and the Sayed al-Hashim Mosque. In Zaytun lies the Saint Porphryrius Church, the Katib al-Wilaya Mosque, and Hamam as-Sammara (\"the Samaritan's Bathhouse.\")\n\nDistricts\nGaza is composed of thirteen districts (hayy) outside of the Old City. The first extension of Gaza beyond its city center was the district of Shuja'iyya, built on a hill just east and southeast of the Old City during the Ayyubid period. In the northeast is the Mamluk-era district of Tuffah, which is roughly divided into eastern and western halves and was originally located within the Old City's walls.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, a new residential district, Rimal (currently divided into the districts of Northern Rimal and Southern Rimal), was constructed on the sand dunes west of the city center, and the district of Zeitoun was built along Gaza's southern and southwestern borders, while the Judeide (\"the New\") and Turukman neighborhoods of Shuja'iyya expanded into separate districts in the northeast and southeast, respectively. Judeide (also known Shuja'iyyat al-Akrad) was named after the Kurdish military units who settled there during the Mamluk era, while Turukman was named after the Turkmen military units who settled there.\n\nThe areas between Rimal and the Old City became the districts of Sabra and Daraj. In the northwest is the district of Nasser, built in the early 1950s and named in honor of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. The district of Sheikh Radwan, developed in the 1970s, is 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the north of the Old City and is named after Sheikh Radwan—the tomb of whom is located within the district. Gaza has absorbed the village of al-Qubbah near the border with Israel, as well as the Palestinian refugee camp of al-Shati along the coast, although the latter is not under the city's municipal jurisdiction. In the late 1990s, the PNA built the more affluent neighborhood of Tel al-Hawa along the southern edge of Rimal. Along the southern coast of the city is the neighborhood of Sheikh Ijlin.\n\nClimate\nGaza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh), with Mediterranean characteristics, featuring mild rainy winters and dry hot but humid summers. Spring arrives around March or April and the hottest month is August, with the average high being 31.7 °C (89.1 °F). The coolest month is January with temperatures usually peaking at 18.3 °C (64.9 °F). Rain is scarce and falls almost exclusively between November and March, with annual rainfall totalling approximately 395 millimetres or 15.6 inches.\n\nDemographics\nPopulation\nAccording to Ottoman tax records in 1557, Gaza had 2,477 male taxpayers. The statistics from 1596 show that Gaza's Muslim population consisted of 456 households, 115 bachelors, 59 religious persons, and 19 disabled persons. In addition to the Muslim figure, there were 141 jundiyan or \"soldiers\" in the Ottoman army. Of the Christians, there were 294 households and seven bachelors, while there were 73 Jewish households and eight Samaritan households. In total, an estimated 6,000 people lived in Gaza, making it the third largest city in Ottoman Palestine after Jerusalem and Safad.\nIn 1838, there were roughly 4,000 Muslim and 100 Christian tax payers, implying a population of about 15,000 or 16,000—making it larger than Jerusalem at the time. The total number of Christian families was 57. Before the outbreak of World War I, the population of Gaza had reached 42,000; however, the fierce battles between Allied Forces and the Ottomans and their German allies in 1917 in Gaza resulted in a massive population decrease. The following census, which was conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities shows a sharp decrease in population which stood at 17,480 residents (16,722 Muslims, 701 Christians, 54 Jews and three Metawilehs). The 1931 census lists 17,046 inhabitants (16,356 Muslims, 689 Christians, and one Jew) and another 4,597 in the suburbs (4,561 Muslims and 36 Christians).\nThe village statistics of 1938 list Gaza's population as 20,500 with 5,282 in nearby suburbs. The village statistics of 1945 list the population as 34,250 (33,160 Muslims, 1,010 Christians, and 80 Jews).\nAccording to a 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Gaza and the adjacent al-Shati camp had a population of 353,115, of which 50.9% were males and 49.1% females. Gaza had an overwhelmingly young population with more than half being 19 and under (60.8%). About 28.8% were between the ages of 20 and 44, 7.7% between 45 and 64, and 3.9% were over the age of 64.\n\nA massive influx of Palestinian refugees swelled Gaza's population after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. By 1967, the population had grown to about six times its 1948 size. In 1997, 51.8% of Gaza's inhabitants were refugees or their descendants. The city's population has continued to increase since that time to 590,481 in 2017, making it the largest city in the Palestinian territories. Gaza City has one of the highest overall growth rates in the world. Its population density is 9,982.69/km2 (26,424.76/sq mi) comparable to New York City (10,725.4/km2 – 27,778.7/sq mi), half of Paris density (21,000/km2 – 55,000/sq mi). In 2007 poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions were widespread and many residents received United Nations food aid.\n\nReligion\nThe population of Gaza is overwhelmingly composed of Muslims, who mostly follow Sunni Islam. During the Fatimid period, Shia Islam was dominant in Gaza, but after Saladin conquered the city in 1187, he promoted a strictly Sunni religious and educational policy, which at the time was instrumental in uniting his Arab and Turkish soldiers.\nGaza is home to a small Palestinian Christian minority of about 3,500 people. The majority live in the Zaytun Quarter of the Old City and belong to the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Baptist denominations. In 1906, there were about 750 Christians, of which 700 were Orthodox and 50 were Roman Catholic.\nGaza's Jewish community was roughly 3,000 years old, and in 1481 there were sixty Jewish households. At the time of the 1929 Palestine riots, there were fifty families living in Gaza, most of whom fled after the riots. In Sami Hadawi's land and population survey, Gaza had a population of 34,250, including 80 Jews in 1945. Most of them left the city after the 1948 War, due to mutual distrust between them and the Arab majority. Today, there are no Jews living in Gaza.\n\nEconomy\nThe major agricultural products are strawberries, citrus, dates, olives, flowers, and various vegetables. Pollution and high demand for water have reduced the productive capacity of farms in the Gaza Strip. Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets. Since the Oslo Accords, thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations. Minor industries include textiles and food processing. A variety of wares are sold in Gaza's street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, wicker furniture, and cotton clothing. The upscale Gaza Mall opened in July 2010.\nA report by human rights and development groups published in 2008 stated that Gaza had suffered a long term pattern of economic stagnation and dire development indicators, the severity which was increased exponentially by the Israeli and Egyptian blockades. The report cited a number of economic indicators to illustrate the point: In 2008, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended due to lack of access inputs for production and export problems. In 2009, unemployment in Gaza was close to 40%. The private sector which generates 53% of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt. In June 2005, 3,900 factories in Gaza employed 35,000 people, by December 2007, only 1,700 were still employed. The construction industry was paralyzed with tens of thousands of laborers out of work. The agriculture sector was hard hit, affecting nearly 40,000 workers dependent on cash crops.\nGaza's food prices rose during the blockade, with wheat flour going up 34%, rice up 21%, and baby powder up 30%. In 2007, households spent an average of 62% of their total income on food, compared to 37% in 2004. In less than a decade, the number of families depending on UNRWA food aid increased tenfold. In 2008, 80% of the population relied on humanitarian aid in 2008 compared to 63% in 2006. According to a report by OXFAM in 2009, Gaza suffered from a serious shortage of housing, educational facilities, health facilities and infrastructure, along with an inadequate sewage system that contributed to hygiene and public health problems.\nFollowing a significant easing of the closure policy in 2010, the economy of Gaza began to see a substantial recovery from anemic levels during the height of the blockade. The economy of Gaza grew by 8% in the first 11 months of 2010. Economic activity is largely supported by foreign aid donations. There are a number of hotels in Gaza, including the Palestine, Grand Palace, Adam, al-Amal, al-Quds, Cliff, al-Deira and Marna House. All, except the Palestine Hotel, are located along in the coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street. Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists, and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists, aid workers, and UN and Red Cross personnel. Upmarket hotels include the al-Quds and the al-Deira Hotel.\nPresence of hydrocarbon reserves around the region gives potential to Gaza, to develop as a leading industrial center. Many of the region’s gas and oil fields are underneath Gaza. In 1999, natural gas reserves were discovered, offshore of the territory, known as Gaza Marine. It holds 1 trillion cubic feet (28 billion cubic metres) of natural gas, as a part of the Levant Basin, which itself holds 122 trillion cubic feet (3.5 trillion cubic metres) of natural gas. The Levant Basin on the Mediterranean Sea, which includes coastal regions of Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, is estimated to have 1.7 billion barrels (270,000,000 m3) of oil. Gaza is the only coastal part of the State of Palestine. In 2000, exploration license were granted by the government to British Gas Group. However, the project was interrupted during the 2000–2005 uprisings, where supportive infrastructure, the seaport and airport was destroyed by Israel. In 2023, the work gain momentum again, until it was crashed in the ongoing war. A large number of people used to believe that, Gaza's oil and gas reserves is the reason for Israel's offensive on the territory, also described as a potential genocidal campaign.\n\nCulture\nCultural centers and museums\nThe Rashad Shawa Cultural Center, located in Rimal, was completed in 1988 and named after its founder, former mayor Rashad al-Shawa. A two-story building with a triangular plan, the cultural centers performs three main functions: a meeting place for large gatherings during annual festivals, a place to stage exhibitions, and a library. The French Cultural Center is a symbol of French partnership and cooperation in Gaza. It holds art exhibits, concerts, film screenings, and other activities. Whenever possible, French artists are invited to display their artwork, and more frequently, Palestinian artists from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are invited to participate in art competitions.\nEstablished in 1998, the Arts and Crafts Village is a children's cultural center with the objectives of promoting comprehensive, regular and periodic documentation of creative art. It interacted on a large scale with a class of artists from different nationalities and organized around 100 exhibitions for creative art, ceramics, graphics, carvings and others. Nearly 10,000 children from throughout the Gaza Strip have benefited from the Arts and Crafts Village.\nThe Gaza Theater, financed by contributions from Norway, opened in 2004. The theater does not receive much funding from the PNA, depending mostly on donations from foreign aid agencies. The A. M. Qattan Foundation, a Palestinian arts charity, runs several workshops in Gaza to develop young artistic talent and impart drama skills to teachers. The Gaza Theater Festival was inaugurated in 2005.\nThe Gaza Museum of Archaeology opened in the summer of 2008. The museum collection features thousands of items, including a statue of a full-breasted Aphrodite in a diaphanous gown, images of other ancient deities and oil lamps featuring menorahs.\n\nCuisine\nGaza's cuisine is characterized by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also played a role in many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas (\"chard and lentils\") and bisara (fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).\nSeafood is a key aspect of Gaza life and a local staple, Some well-known seafood dishes include zibdiyit gambari, literally, \"shrimps in a clay pot\", and shatta which are crabs stuffed with red hot chili pepper dip, then baked in the oven. Fish is either fried or grilled after being stuffed with cilantro, garlic, chillies and cumin, and marinated with various spices. It is also a key ingredient in sayyadiya, rice cooked with caramelized onions, a generous amount of whole garlic cloves, large chunks of well-marinated fried fish, and spices such as turmeric, cinnamon, and cumin. Many of the 1948-era refugees were fellahin (\"peasants\") who ate seasonal foods. Sumaghiyyeh, popular in Gaza not just on Ramadan but all year round, is a mixture of sumac, tahina and water combined with chard, chunks of beef and chickpeas. The dish is topped with crushed dill seeds, chillies and fried garlic and served in bowls. Maftool is a wheat-based dish flavored with dried sour plums that is served like couscous or shaped into little balls and steamed over stew or soup.\nMost Gaza restaurants are located in the Rimal district. Al-Andalus, which specializes in fish and seafood, is popular with tourists, as are al-Sammak and the upscale Roots Club. Atfaluna is a stylish restaurant near Gaza port run and staffed by deaf people with the goal of building a society that is more accepting of people with disabilities.\nThroughout the Old City there are street stalls that sell cooked beans, hummus, roasted sweet potatoes, falafel, and kebabs. Coffee houses (qahwa) serve Arabic coffee and tea. Gaza's well-known sweet shops, Saqqala and Arafat, sell common Arab sweet products and are located off Wehda Street. Alcohol is a rarity, found only in the United Nations Beach Club.\n\nCostumes and embroidery\nGauze is reputed to have originated in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal. Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric that had been made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.\nCirca 1990, Hamas and other Islamic movements sought to increase the use of the hijab (\"headscarf\") among Gazan women, especially urban and educated women, and the hijab styles since introduced have varied according to class and group identity.\n\nSports\nPalestine Stadium, the Palestinian national stadium, is located in Gaza and has a capacity for 10,000 people. Gaza has several local football teams that participate in the Gaza Strip League. They include Khidmat al-Shatia (al-Shati Camp), Ittihad al-Shuja'iyya (Shuja'iyya neighborhood), Gaza Sports Club, and al-Zeitoun (Zeitoun neighborhood).\n\nGovernance\nToday, Gaza serves as the administrative capital of the Gaza Governorate. It contains the currently defunct Palestinian Legislative Council building.\nThe first municipal council of Gaza was formed in 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa. Modern mayorship, however, began in 1906 with his son Said al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by the Ottoman authorities. Al-Shawa oversaw the construction of Gaza's first hospital, several new mosques and schools, the restoration of the Great Mosque, and the introduction of the modern plow to the city. In 1922, British colonial secretary Winston Churchill requested that Gaza develop its own constitution under Mandatory Palestine. However, it was rejected by the Palestinians.\nOn 24 July 1994, the PNA proclaimed Gaza the first city council in the Palestinian territories. The 2005 Palestinian municipal elections were not held in Gaza, nor in Khan Yunis or Rafah. Instead, Fatah party officials selected the smaller cities, towns, and villages to hold elections, assuming they would fare better in less urban areas. The rival Hamas party, however, won the majority of seats in seven of the ten municipalities selected for the first round with voter turnout being around 80%. 2007 saw violent clashes between the two parties that left over 100 dead, ultimately resulting in Hamas taking over the city.\nNormally, Palestinian municipalities with populations over 20,000 and that serve as administrative centers have municipal councils consisting of fifteen members, including the mayor. The current municipal council of Gaza, however, consists of fourteen members, including the installed by Hamas mayor, Nizar Hijazi.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the PCBS, in 1997, approximately over 90% of Gaza's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 140,848 were enrolled in schools (39.8% in elementary school, 33.8% in secondary school, and 26.4% in high school). About 11,134 people received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas.\nIn 2006, there were 210 schools in Gaza; 151 were run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 46 were run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and 13 were private schools. A total of 154,251 students were enrolled and 5,877 teachers were employed. The currently downtrodden economy has affected education in the Gaza Strip severely. In September 2007, a UNRWA survey in the Gaza Strip revealed that there was a nearly 80% failure rate in schools grades four to nine, with up to 90% failure rates in mathematics. In January 2008, the United Nations Children's Fund reported that schools in Gaza had been canceling classes that were high on energy consumption, such as information technology or science labs, and extra curricular activities.\n\nUniversities\nGaza has many universities. The four main universities in the city are al-Azhar University – Gaza, al-Quds Open University, al-Aqsa University and the Islamic University of Gaza. The Islamic University, consisting of ten facilities, was founded by a group of businessmen in 1978, making it the first University in Gaza. It had an enrollment of 20,639 students. Al-Azhar is generally secular and was founded in 1992. Al-Aqsa University was established in 1991. Al-Quds Open University established its Gaza Educational Region campus in 1992 in a rented building in the center of the city originally with 730 students. Because of the rapid increase of the number of students, it constructed the first university owned building in the Nasser District. In 2006–07, it had an enrollment of 3,778 students.\n\nPublic library\nThe Public Library of Gaza is located off Wehda Street and has a collection of nearly 10,000 books in Arabic, English and French. A total area of about 1,410 square metres (15,200 sq ft), the building consists of two floors and a basement. The library was opened in 1999 after cooperation dating from 1996 by Gaza under mayor Aoun Shawa, the municipality of Dunkirk, and the World Bank. The library's primary objectives are to provide sources of information that meets the needs of beneficiaries, provide necessary facilities for access to available information sources, and organizing various cultural programs such as, cultural events, seminars, lectures, film presentations, videos, art and book exhibitions.\nOn 27 November 2023, the Public Library was destroyed by Israeli airstrike.\n\nLandmarks\nLandmarks in Gaza include the Great Mosque in the Old City. Originally a pagan temple, it was consecrated a Greek Orthodox church by the Byzantines, then a mosque in the 8th century by the Arabs. The Crusaders transformed it into a church, but it was reestablished as a mosque soon after Gaza's reconquest by the Muslims. It is the oldest and largest in the Gaza Strip. In 2023, at the beginning of the Gaza war, it was destroyed by the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip, leaving most of the structure collapsed and the minaret partially destroyed.\n\nOther mosques in the Old City include the Mamluk-era Sayed al-Hashim Mosque that believed to house the tomb of the Islamic prophet Mohammed's great-grandfather, Hashim ibn Abd al-Manaf, in its dome. The building was damaged by an Israeli airstrike in October 2023, during the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip. There is also the nearby Kateb al-Welaya Mosque that dates back to 1334. In Shuja'iyya is the Ibn Uthman Mosque, which was built by Nablus native Ahmad ibn Uthman in 1402, and the Mahkamah Mosque built by Mamluk majordomo Birdibak al-Ashrafi in 1455. In Tuffah is the Ibn Marwan Mosque, which was built in 1324 and houses the tomb of Ali ibn Marwan, a holy man.\nThe Unknown Soldier's Square, located in Rimal, is a monument dedicated to an unknown Palestinian fighter who died in the 1948 War. In 1967, the monument was torn down by Israeli forces and remained a patch of sand, until a public garden was built there with funding from Norway.\n\nQasr al-Basha, originally a Mamluk-era villa that was used by Napoleon during his brief sojourn in Gaza, is located in the Old City and is today a girls' school. It was destroyed in the Israeli invasion of Gaza in 2024.\n\nThe Commonwealth Gaza War Cemetery, often referred to as the British War Cemetery, contains the graves of fallen Allied soldiers in World War I; it sits 1.5 km (1 mi) northeast of the city center, in the Tuffah district, near Salah al-Din Road. The cemetery has been damaged by Israeli army in the early stages of the Gaza war in 2023.\n\nThe Church of Saint Porphyrius, a Greek Orthodox church, oldest active church in the city and the third oldest church in the world. On 19 October 2023, part of the church was damaged during an Israeli airstrike, killing at least 18 civilians of the 450 Christian and Muslim Palestinian residents of the Gaza Strip that had been sheltering there.\n\nInfrastructure\nWater supply and sanitation\nAccording to the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 98.1% of Gaza's residents were connected to the public water supply while the remainder used a private system. About 87.6% were connected to a public sewage system and 11.8% used a cesspit. The blockade on Gaza severely restricted the city's water supply. The six main wells for drinking water did not function, and roughly 50% of the population had no water on a regular basis. The municipality claimed it was forced to pump water through \"salty wells\" because of the unavailability of electricity. About 20 million liters of raw sewage and 40 million liters of partially treated water per day flowed into the Mediterranean Sea, and untreated sewage bred insects and mice.\nAs a \"water-poor\" country, Gaza is highly dependent on water from Wadi Ghazza. The Gaza Aquifer is used as Gaza's main resource for obtaining quality water. However, the majority of water from Wadi Ghazza is transported to Jerusalem.\n\nPower grid\nIn 2002 Gaza began operating its own power plant which was built by Enron. However, the power plant was bombed and destroyed by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2006. Prior to the power plant's destruction Israel provided additional electricity to Gaza through the Israel Electric Corporation. The plant was partially rebuilt by December 2007, and Israeli electricity continues to be sold to Gaza.\n\nSolid waste management\nSolid waste management is one of key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, and the absence of law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management. One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.\nFor instance, the scale of damage resulting from Operation Protective Edge was unprecedented. All governorates in the Gaza Strip witnessed extensive aerial bombardment, naval shelling and artillery fire, resulting in a considerable amount of rubble. According to recent statistics, more than 2 million tonnes of debris was generated. Approximately 10,000 houses were leveled to the ground including two 13-story residential buildings. A tremendous amount of debris remains scattered in Gaza. Serious efforts and a high budget are required to handle this challenge. More importantly, and based on a UNEP study after the 2008 war, the debris is highly likely to be contaminated with PAHs and probably with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furan compounds. In January 2024, the Israeli army destroyed Gaza City’s main reservoirs, Al-Balad and Al-Rimal.\n\nHealth care\nAl-Shifa Hospital (\"the Cure\") was founded in the Rimal District by the British Mandate government in the 1940s. Housed in an army barracks, it originally provided quarantine and treatment for febrile diseases. When Egypt administered Gaza, this original department was relocated and al-Shifa became the city's central hospital. When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip after occupying it in the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser had al-Shifa hospital expanded and improved. He also ordered the establishment of a second hospital in the Nasser District with the same name. In 1957, the quarantine and febrile disease hospital was rebuilt and named Nasser Hospital. Today, al-Shifa remains Gaza's largest medical complex.\nThroughout the late 1950s, a new health administration, Bandar Gaza (\"Gaza Region\"), was established and headed by Haidar Abdel-Shafi. Bandar Gaza rented several rooms throughout the city to set up government clinics that provided essential curative care.\n\nThe Ahli Arab Hospital, founded in 1907 by the Church Missionary Society (CMS), was destroyed in World War I. It was rebuilt after the war by the CMS, and in 1955 became the Southern Baptist Hospital. In 1982, the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem took leadership and the original name was restored. Al-Quds Hospital, located in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood and managed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society, is the second largest hospital in Gaza.\nIn 2007, hospitals experienced power cuts lasting for 8–12 hours daily and diesel required for power generators was in short supply. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the proportion of patients given permits to exit Gaza for medical care decreased from 89.3% in January 2007 to 64.3% in December 2007.\nIn 2010, a team of doctors from Al-Durrah Hospital in Gaza spent a year of training at the cystic fibrosis clinic at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. Upon their return to Gaza, a cystic fibrosis center was established at Al-Durrah, although the most serious cases are referred to Hadassah.\nAl-Rantisi Hospital provides care for children.\n\nTransportation\nThe Rasheed Coastal Road runs along Gaza's coastline and connects it with the rest of Gaza Strip's coastline north and south. The main highway of the Gaza Strip, Salah al-Din Road (the modern Via Maris) runs through the middle of Gaza City, connecting it with Deir al-Balah, Khan Yunis, and Rafah in the south and Jabalia and Beit Hanoun in the north. The northern crossing of Salah ad-Din Street into Israel is the Erez Crossing and the crossing into Egypt is the Rafah Crossing.\nOmar Mukhtar Street is the main road in the city running north–south, branching off Salah ad-Din Street, stretching from the Rimal coastline and the Old City where it ends at the Gold Market. Prior to the Blockade of the Gaza Strip, there existed regular lines of collective taxis to Ramallah and Hebron in the West Bank. Except for private cars, Gaza City is served by taxis and buses.\nThe Yasser Arafat International Airport near Rafah opened in 1998 40 kilometres (25 mi) south of Gaza. Its runways and facilities were damaged by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2001 and 2002, rendering the airport unusable. In 2010, the tarmac ramp was destroyed by Palestinians seeking stones and recycled building materials. The Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel is located roughly 75 kilometres (47 mi) northeast of the city.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nGaza is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nGaza genocide\nList of cities administered by the Palestinian Authority\nList of rulers of Gaza\nOutline of the State of Palestine\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nMunicipality of Gaza\nSpokesperson for Gaza Municipality\nGaza at Google Maps\nThe achievements of the municipal council for a period of 5 years (2008–2013) in Arabic Archived 19 August 2014 at the Wayback Machine",
          "summary": "Gaza City, often simply called Gaza, is a city in the Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Gaza Governorate. Located on the Mediterranean coast, 76.6 kilometres (47.6 mi) southwest of Jerusalem, it was home to Palestine's only port. With a population of 590,481 people as of 2017, Gaza City was the most populous city in Palestine until the Gaza war caused most of the population to be displaced.\nInhabited since at least the 15th century BC, Gaza City has been dominated by different peoples and empires throughout its history. The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years. Under the Roman Empire, Gaza City experienced relative peace and its Mediterranean port flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in the Palestine region to be conquered by the Rashidun army and quickly developed into a centre of Islamic law. However, by the time the Crusader states were established in 1099, Gaza City was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza City experienced several hardships—from Mongol raids to severe flooding and locust swarms, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza City and the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza City was established in 1893.\nGaza City fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine. As a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Its population rose sharply after the influx of Palestinian refugees displaced by the war and the ensuing Nakba. Gaza City was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, and in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly created Palestinian National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas, resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. The Gaza Strip was then subject to an Israeli-led, Egyptian-supported blockade. Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah Border Crossing in 2011 to pedestrians. The city has been largely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes since the Gaza war began in October 2023, including a large amount of significant cultural heritage in the Old City of Gaza.\nThe primary economic activities of Gaza City are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the blockade and recurring conflicts have put the economy under severe pressure. The majority of Gaza City's Palestinian inhabitants are Muslim, although there is also a Christian minority. Gaza City has a very young population, with roughly 75% under the age of 25. As of November 2025, many residents have fled or been evacuated to the Southern Gaza Strip, or killed as a result of Israel's actions in the north. Therefore, previous recorded or estimated population numbers have become outdated.",

الشمال الشرقي اراضي مدينه الخليل الغربيه المحتله منذ عام 1948 وهي مركز محافظه غزه اداريًا واكبر مدن قطاع غزه، فمن حيث تعداد السكان بلغ عدد سكان المدينه 2,141,000 نسمه في عام 2023م، ما يجعلها اكبر تجمع للفلسطينيين في فلسطين. تبلغ مساحتها 56 كم2، مما يجعلها من اكثر المدن كثافه بالسكان في العالم.\nتعتبر مدينه غزه من اهم المدن الفلسطينيه؛ لاهميه موقعها الاستراتيجي والاهميه الاقتصاديه والعمرانيه للمدينه، بالاضافه الى كونها المقر المؤقت للسلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه، ووجود الكثير من مقراتها ووزارتها فيها.\nاسس المدينه الكنعانيون في القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، احتلها الكثير من الغزاه كالفراعنه والاغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والعثمانيين والانجليز وغيرهم. في عام 635م دخل المسلمون العرب المدينه واصبحت مركزاً اسلامياً مهماً. يوجد بها قبر هاشم بن عبد مناف الجد الثاني للنبي محمد بن عبد الله، لذلك تُسمى ايضاً غزه هاشم، كما انها مسقط راس الامام الشافعي الذي ولد عام 767م وهو احد ائمه المذاهب الاربعه عند المسلمين السنه.\nفي التاريخ المعاصر، سقطت غزه في ايدي القوات البريطانيه اثناء الحرب العالميه الاولى، واصبحت جزءاً من الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ونتيجه للحرب العربيه الاسرائيليه عام 1948م، تولت مصر اداره اراضي قطاع غزه واجرت عده تحسينات على المدينه. احتلت اسرائيل قطاع غزه عام 1967م (عام النكسه)، وبعد اتفاقيه اوسلو بين منظمه التحرير الفلسطينيه واسرائيل عام 1993م، بموجب اتفاق غزه-اريحا الموقَّع في 4 مايو عام 1994م انتقلت السلطه المدنيه الى سلطه الحكم الذاتي الفلسطيني. بعد انتخابات عام 2006م اندلع قتال بين حركه فتح وحركه المقاومه الاسلاميه حماس، حيث رفضت حركه فتح نقل السلطه في غزه الى حركه حماس، ومنذ ذلك الحين وقعت غزه تحت الحصار من قبل اسرائيل ومصر. بعد الثوره المصريه في 25 يناير 2011م، فتحت مصر معبر رفح من اجل التسهيل على مواطني غزه، مع ان هذا القرار لم يُشكِّل فارقاً كبيراً.\nالانشطه الاقتصاديه الرئيسيه في قطاع غزه هي الصناعات الصغيره والزراعه والعمل، ومع ذلك، فقد دُمِّر الاقتصاد من خلال الحصار الاسرائيلي والصراعات المتكرره.\n\nالتسميه\nتُعتبر غزه احد اقدم المدن التي عرفها التاريخ، اما سبب تسميتها بهذا الاسم فهو غير مُثبَّت بدقه، لان هذا الاسم كان قابلاً للتبديل والتحريف بتبدل الامم التي صارعتها، فهي عند الكنعانيين (هزاتي)، وعند الفراعنه (غزاتو او غذه) منذ القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، اما الاشوريون واليونانيون فكانوا يطلقون عليها (عزاتي) و(فازا)، وعند العبرانيين (عزه). اما العرب الجنوبيين (سبا، ومعين) فهي عندهم باللفظ العربي (غزه)، وهي في وصفهم ميناء مهم بالقرب من قرى اليهود، وذكرت لديهم منذ القرن الرابع قبل الميلاد فصاعدًا.\nفي العصور الوسطى، سماها الصليبيون (غادرز)، والاتراك لم يغيروا من اسمها العربي (غزه)، اما الانجليز ويطلقون عليها اسم (گازا) (بالانجليزيه: Gaza). وقد اختلف المؤرخون - كعادتهم بالنسبه لكثير من المدن القديمه – في سبب تسميتها بغزه، فهناك من يقول انها مشتقه من المَنَعَه والقوه، وهناك من يقول ان معناها: «الثروه»، واخرون يرون انها تعني: «المُميزه» او «المُختصه» بصفات هامه تميزها عن غيرها من المدن. اما ياقوت الحموي فيقول عنها في معجمه: «غَزَّ فلان بفلان واعتز به اذا اختصه من بين اصحابه».\nارتبط العرب بغزه ارتباطاً وثيقاً فقد كان تجارهم يَفِدون اليها في تجارتهم واسفارهم باعتبارها مركزاً مهماً لعدد من الطرق التجاريه، وكانت تمثل الهدف لاحدى الرحلتين الشهيرتين اللتين وردتا في القران الكريم في «سوره قريش»: «رحلتا الشتاء والصيف»: رحله القرشيين شتاءً الى اليمن، ورحلتهم صيفاً الى غزه ومشارف الشام. وفي احدى رحلات الصيف هذه، مات هاشم بن عبد مناف جدُّ الرسول المصطفى صلى الله عليه وسلم، ودُفن في غزه بالجامع المعروف حالياً بجامع السيد هاشم في حي «الدرج».\n\nالتاريخ\nاسس المدينه الكنعانيون في القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد. وطيله تاريخها، لم يكن لغزه حكم مستقل، حيث احتلها الكثير من الغزاه كالفراعنه والاغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والعثمانيين وغيرهم. وكانت اول مره تذكر فيها المدينه في مخطوطه للفرعون تحتمس الثالث (القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد)، وكذلك ورد اسمها في رسائل تل العمارنه. بعد 300 سنه من الاحتلال الفرعوني للمدينه نزلت قبيله من الفلستينيين وسكنت المدينه والمنطقه المجاوره لها، عام 635م دخل المسلمون العرب المدينه واصبحت مركزا اسلاميا مهما وخاصه انها مشهوره بوجود قبر الجد الثاني للنبي محمد، هاشم بن عبد مناف فيها ولذلك احيانا تسمى غزه هاشم. وتُعتبر المدينه مسقط راس الامام الشافعي 767م الذي هو احد الائمه الاربعه عند المسلمين السنه. سيطر الاوروبيون على المدينه في فتره الحملات الصليبيه، لكنها رجعت تحت حكم المسلمين بعد ان انتصر صلاح الدين الايوبي عليهم في معركه حطين عام 1187. ازدهرت المدينه في اخر ايام الحكم العثماني، حيث تاسس فيها اول مجلس بلدي عام 1893. سقطت غزه في ايدي القوات البريطانيه اثناء الحرب العالميه الاولى، واصبحت جزء من الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ونتيجه للحرب العربيه الاسرائيليه عام 1948، تولت مصر اداره اراضي قطاع غزه واجريت عده تحسينات في المدينه.\nاحتلت اسرائيل قطاع غزه عام 1967 (النكسه)، ولكن في عام 1993م، نُقلت المدينه الى السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه. بعد انتخابات عام 2006، اندلع قتال بين حركه فتح وحركه المقاومه الاسلاميه حماس، حيث رفضت حركه فتح نقل السلطه في غزه الى حركه حماس. ومنذ ذلك الحين وقعت غزه تحت الحصار من قبل اسرائيل ومصر. لكن بعد الثوره المصريه، قامت مصر بفتح معبر رفح من اجل التسهيل على مواطنين غزه، مع ان هذا القرار لم يُحدث فرقًا كبيرًا.\n\nالفتره القديمه\nيعود الاستيطان البشري في منطقه قطاع غزه الى تل السكن، وهو حصن مصري قديم، والذي بني في الاراضي الكنعانيه الى الجنوب من قطاع غزه في الوقت الحاضر. كما ان مركزًا اخر في المناطق الحضريه المعروفه باسم تل العجول بدا ينمو على طول وادي مجرى النهر في غزه.\nخلال العصر البرونزي الاوسط، اصبحت تل السكن اقصى مدن جنوب كنعان، وكانت وظيفتها بمثابه حصن. في عام 1650 قبل الميلاد، عندما احتل الهكسوس مصر، عُمرت مدينه ثانيه على انقاض تل السكن. ومع ذلك، هجرها في القرن 14 قبل الميلاد، في نهايه العصر البرونزي.\nاصبحت غزه في وقت لاحق عاصمه مصر الاداريه في ارض كنعان. في عهد تحتمس الثالث، اصبحت المدينه محطه على طريق القوافل بين مصر وسوريا، وجاءت في رسائل تل العمارنه باسم \"Azzati\".\nبقيت المدينه تحت السيطره المصريه لمده 350 عاما حتى غزاها الفلستينيون في القرن الثاني عشر قبل الميلاد، واصبحت جزءا من البنتابوليس \"pentapolis\" الخاص بهم. ووفقا لسفر القضاه، فان غزه كانت المكان الذي كان قد سجن فيه شمشون من قبل الفلستينيين حتى وفاته.\nبعد ان سيطر الاشوريون والمصريون على المدينه، حققت غزه الاستقلال النسبي والازدهار في ظل الامبراطوريه الفارسيه. ولقد حاصر الاسكندر الاكبر غزه، حيث بقت اخر مدينه تقاوم غزوه في طريقه الى مصر، لمده خمسه اشهر قبل احتلالها اخيرا سنه 332 قبل الميلاد، وكان سكانها اما قتلوا او تم سبيهم. احضر الاسكندر البدو المحليين ليسكنوا غزه، ونظم المدينه الى بوليس (او دوله-المدينه). وقد اكتسبت المدينه سمعه طيبه كمركز مزدهر للتعلم اليونانيه والفلسفه.\nشهدت غزه حصارا اخر في 96 قبل الميلاد من قبل الحشمونيين الذين «اطاحوا تماما» في المدينه، مما اسفر عن مقتل 500 من اعضاء مجلس الشيوخ الذين كانوا قد فروا الى معبد ابولو للسلامه.\n\nالعهد الروماني والبيزنطي\nاُعيد بناء المدينه بعد دمجها في الامبراطوريه الرومانيه في 63 قبل الميلاد تحت قياده بومبيوس الكبير، ثم اصبحت غزه بعد ذلك جزءا من احد مقاطعات الدوله الرومانيه في بلاد الشام. وكانت المدينه مستهدفه من قبل اليهود خلال تمردهم ضد الحكم الروماني في 66 وقد دمرت جزئيا. وظلت مع ذلك مدينه مهمه، خاصه بعد تدمير القدس. طوال العصر الروماني، كانت غزه مدينه مزدهره وتلقى المنح واهتمام عده اباطره. كان 500 عضو في مجلس الشيوخ يحكم غزه، وكان سكان المدينه مجموعه متنوعه من مختلف الاعراق، منهم الفلستينيين والاغريق والرومان والكنعانيين والفينيقيين واليهود والفراعنه والفرس، بالاضافه الى البدو. وكانت تصدر في غزه عملات معدنيه تزين مع تماثيل الالهه والاباطره. وخلال زيارته للمدينه في 130م، قام الامبراطور هادريان بافتتاح حلبه المصارعه شخصيا، في ملعب غزه الجديد، الذي اصبح معروفًا من الاسكندريه الى دمشق. وقد زينت المدينه في العديد من المعابد الوثنيه، وكان الاله الرئيسي \"مارناس\"، وهو احد الالهه القديمه التي انتشرت عبادتها في سوريا القديمه منذ النصف الثاني من الالف الثالث قبل الميلاد، وكان يطلق عليها داجون. وخُصصت المعابد الاخرى لزيوس، وهيليوس، وافروديت، وابولو، واثينا، وتيشي المحليه.\nبدات المسيحيه بالانتشار في جميع انحاء منطقه غزه في 250م، بما في ذلك في ميناء غزه.\nوتسارع اعتناق المسيحيه في منطقه غزه في فتره القديس بورفيريوس (بين عامي 396م و 420م). في سنه 402م، امر الامبراطور ثيودوسيوس الثاني بتدمير جميع معابد المدينه الوثنيه الثمانيه، وبعد اربع سنوات كلفت الامبراطوره ايليا ببناء كنيسه فوق انقاض معبد Marnas.\nوبعد انقسام الامبراطوريه الرومانيه في القرن 3 م، كانت غزه لا تزال تحت سيطره الامبراطوريه الرومانيه الشرقيه التي بدورها اصبحت الامبراطوريه البيزنطيه. ازدهرت المدينه، وكانت مركزا هاما لبلاد الشام.\n\nالحكم الاسلامي\nفي عام 635م حاصر المسلمون غزه وسيطر عليها جيش الخلفاء الراشدين تحت قياده عمرو بن العاص بعد معركه اجنادين بين الامبراطوريه البيزنطيه والخلافه الراشده في وسط فلسطين. وكان وصول العرب المسلمين قد جلب تغييرات جذريه على غزه، في البدايه حُولت بعض الكنائس الى مساجد، بما في ذلك المسجد الكبير الحالي في قطاع غزه (الاقدم في المدينه)، كما ان شريحه كبيره من السكان اعتنقت الاسلام، واصبحت اللغه العربيه هي اللغه الرسميه.\nوتعتبر المدينه مسقط راس الشافعي (767) الذي هو احد الائمه الاربعه عند المسلمين السنه. والذي عاش طفولته المبكره هناك. وكان الشافعي قد اسس فلسفه اسلاميه سنيه في الفقه، وسُمي المذهب الشافعي تكريما له. وعلى الرغم من حظر الكحول في الاسلام، سمح للجاليات اليهوديه والمسيحيه للحفاظ على انتاج النبيذ والعنب، وهو محصول نقدي رئيسي في المدينه، وكانت اساسا للتصدير الى مصر. لانه تحدها الصحراء، وكانت غزه عرضه لقتال جماعات البدو.\nفي عام 796م دُمرت غزه خلال حرب اهليه بين القبائل العربيه في المنطقه. ومع ذلك، تم اعاده بناء المدينه من قبل الخلافه العربيه الثالثه التي يحكمها العباسيون. وقد وصف الجغرافي العربي المقدسي غزه في 977م حين كان يحكمها الفاطميون «بانها بلده كبيره تقع على الطريق الرئيسي لمصر على الحدود مع الصحراء.» وقد كان في تلك الفتره اتفاق مع السلاجقه، تم بموجبه سيطره الفاطميين على غزه والاراضي الواقعه جنوبها، بما في ذلك مصر.\n\nالصليبيون والمماليك\nاحتل الصليبيون الاوروبيون المدينه من الفاطميين في عام 1100م، وقام الملك بلدوين الثالث ببناء القلعه التي استخدمها فرسان الهيكل في غزه في عام 1149. كما تحول الجامع الكبير الى كاتدرائيه القديس يوحنا. في عام 1154، كتب الرحاله العربي الادريسي عن غزه «المدينه اليوم كثيره السكان، وهي في ايدي الصليبيين».\nفي عام 1187م سيطرت القوات الايوبيه، بقياده صلاح الدين الايوبي على غزه، ثم دُمّرت تحصيناتها لاحقًا عام 1191م. وقد امر ريتشارد قلب الاسد بتدعيم المدينه مره اخري في 1192، لكن تم تفكيك الجدران مره اخرى نتيجه لمعاهده الرمله المتفق عليها في 1193. ولقد استمرت الفتره الايوبيه حتى 1260، بعد تدمير المدينه تماما على يد المغول تحت قياده هولاكو، حيث اصبحت غزه ابعد نقطه الى جنوب يتقدم اليها الجيش المغولي.\nبعد تدمير غزه على يد المغول، بدا الجنود المماليك باداره المنطقه في عام 1277م. وقد جعل المماليك غزه عاصمه المحافظه التي تحمل اسمها «حاكميه قطاع غزه». هذه منطقه تمتد على طول السهل الساحلي من مدينه رفح في الجنوب الى الشمال مباشره من قيساريه، والى الشرق. بقدر ما المرتفعات الغربيه وتلال الخليل المدن الرئيسيه الاخرى في المحافظه وشملت اللد والرمله. وقد استخدم غزه التي دخلت فتره من الهدوء خلال الفتره المملوكيه بها كموقع في هجماتهم ضد الصليبيين التي انتهت في 1290.\nفي عام 1294م، ضرب زلزال غزه فدمرها، وبعد مرور خمس سنوات، عاد المغول ليُدمروا كل ما اعاد المماليك بناءه. وقد وصف الجغرافي الدمشقي (الذي توفي عام 1327) غزه باعتبارها «مدينه كثيره الشجر، كسماط ممدود لجيش الاسلام في ابواب الرمل ولكل صادر ووارد الى الديار المصريه والشاميه.» وفي 1348م، انتشر الطاعون في المدينه، فقضى على معظم سكانها. كما عانى قطاع غزه من الفيضانات المدمره في عام 1352، والتي كانت نادره في ذلك الجزء القاحل من بلاد الشام الجنوبيه.\nالا ان الرحاله العربي والكاتب ابن بطوطه عندما زار المدينه في 1355، كتب عنها «انها كبيره ومزدحمه بالسكان، وفيها العديد من المساجد». وقد ساهم المماليك في الهندسه المعماريه في غزه ببناء المساجد والمدارس الاسلاميه، والمستشفيات، والحمامات العامه. كما سمحوا لليهود بالعوده الى المدينه، وقد شهد العصر المملوكي ازدهار المجتمع اليهودي في المدينه. في عام 1481م، كتب الرحاله مشولام «انها ارض جيده، ذات اشجار فاكهه وثمار والتي هي من نوعيه ممتازه، وهناك الخبز والخمر، والذي هو من صنع اليهود فقط، وفيها عدد كبير من السكان، هناك 70 عائله يهوديه 4 عائلات سامريه». في نهايه العصر المملوكي كانت الطائفه اليهوديه في غزه ثالث اكبر جاليه يهوديه في فلسطين، بعد صفد والقدس.\nوقد بنى المماليك واحدا من اهم المعالم في غزه، وهو قصر الباشا، الذي كان يُستخدم لحكم المدينه وادارتها. ويقع القصر في البلده القديمه وهو اليوم مدرسه للبنات، بالقرب من مقبره حرب الكومنولث، غالبًا ما يشار اليها بمقبره الحرب البريطانيه، والتي تحتوي على قبور جنود الحلفاء الذين سقطوا في الحرب العالميه الاولى وهي في حي التفاح.\n\nالعهد العثماني\nدخلت المدينه تحت حكم الخلافه العثمانيه الاسلاميه في القرن السادس عشر وبقيت تحت حكمهم حتى سنه 1917 عندما استولت عليها القوات البريطانيه خلال الحرب العالميه الاولى بعد ثلاثه معارك ضاريه راح ضحيتها الالاف من كلا الجانبين. وكانت غزه تتبع متصرفيه القدس العثمانيه، والتي كانت تتبع مباشره للباب العالي دون ان تتبع ايا من الولايات. وكانت المتصرفيه تضم بالاضافه الى قضاء غزه، كل من اقضيه يافا وبئر السبع والخليل. وقد حافظت متصرفيه القدس حتى اواخر العهد العثماني- باستثناء الفتره من 1906 حتى 1909 عندما ضم اليها قضاء الناصره- على حدودها.\nيذكر انه في الحرب العالميه الاولى عندما صمد لواء واحد من الجيش العثماني مؤلف من اقل من ثلاثه الف جندي فلسطيني في وجه فرقتين بريطانيتين امام غزه وكبدهم خسائر فادحه وارغمهما على التقهقر حتى العريش عام 1917 م، اصدر احمد جمال باشا القائد التركي الذي اشتهر بخصومته للعرب، بيانا رسميا اشاد فيه بالشجاعه الفذه التي ابداها اولئك الجنود الفلسطينيون في غزه امام اضعاف اضعافهم من جنود الاعداء، وانها بساله خارقه تذكر بالشجاعه التي ابداها اباؤهم من قبل عندما حموا هذه البقاع المقدسه بقياده صلاح الدين الايوبي.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عام 1917، سقطت غزه بيد الجيش الانجليزي، ودخلت المدينه مع باقي مدن فلسطين مظله الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين عام 1920، واصبحت غزه مركزا لقضاء غزه في تلك الفتره حتى وقوع النكبه، اصبحت جزءا من فلسطين في فتره الانتداب البريطاني وتم اضافتها الى الدوله الفلسطينيه المقترحه عندما اصدرت الامم المتحده قرار تقسيم فلسطين الى دولتين عربيه ويهوديه عام 1947، ولكن قامت مصر بدخول المدينه عام 1948. في فبراير عام 1949 وقعت كل من مصر واسرائيل هدنه تقضي باحتفاظ مصر بالمدينه ولذلك كانت ماوى لكثير من اللاجئين الفلسطينيين عند خروجهم من ديارهم. وبقيت تحت الحكم المصري حتى حرب 1967.\nقرار التقسيم\n\nقامت هيئه الامم المتحده عام 1947 بمحاوله لايجاد حل الصراع العربي الاسرائيلي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئه الامم بتشكيل لجنه UNSCOP المتالّفه من دول متعدّده باستثناء الدّول دائمه العضويه لضمان الحياد في عمليه ايجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنه بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الاول باقامه دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينه القدس من قِبل اداره دوليه. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تاسيس فيدراليه تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهوديه والعربيه. ومال معظم افراد لجنه UNSCOP تجاه المشروع الاول والرامي لتاسيس دولتين مستقلّتين باطار اقتصدي موحد. وقامت هيئه الامم بقبول مشروع لجنه UNSCOP الدّاعي للتقسيم مع اجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركه بين الدولتين، العربيه واليهوديه، على ان يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nاعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من ارض فلسطين للدوله اليهوديه، وشملت حصّه اليهود من ارض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من اسدود الى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينه يافا) واغلبيه مساحه صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينه بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصريه). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحه للزراعه ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الارض الفلسطينيه على اماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهوديه بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدوله اليهوديه.\nوكانت غزه في ذلك الوقت مركزا لقضاء غزه، التي تم الحاقها بالدوله العربيه المُقترحه.\nحكومه عموم فلسطين\n\nهي حكومه تشكلت في غزه في 23 سبتمبر 1948  وذلك خلال حرب 1948 برئاسه احمد حلمي عبد الباقي.\nنشات فكرت تكوينها عندما اعلنت بريطانيا عن نيتها التخلي عن انتدابها على فلسطين واحالت قضيتها الى الامم المتحده. ادركت القياده الفلسطينيه عندئذ، ممثله انذاك بالهيئه العربيه العليا لفلسطين بزعامه الحاج امين الحسيني، اهميه التهيؤ لهذا الحدث واستباقه بايجاد اطار دستوري يملا الفراغ الذي سوف ينجم عن انتهاء الانتداب البريطاني وكان هذا الاطار هو اقامه حكومه عربيه فلسطينيه.\nكان قبل ذلك فولك برنادوت قد اعلن في تقرير له في 16 سبتمبر 1948 ان العرب لم يبدوا اي رغبه في تشكيل حكومه في القسم العربي من فلسطين مما قد يؤدي الى ضمه الى شرق الاردن. وقد قوبل اعلان هذه الحكومه بالرفض من عده انظمه عربيه هي الاردن والعراق ومصر. وظل تمثيلها شكليا لفلسطين في الجامعه العربيه لعده سنوات قبل انهيارها.\n\nالحكم المصري\nبعد حرب 1948، اُلحقت المدينه مع كامل قطاع غزه بمصر، حيث بقت تحت الحكم المصري حتى حرب 1967.\nفي فتره العدوان الثلاثي على مصر سنه 1956 قامت اسرائيل باحتلال المدينه والسيطره على شبه جزيره سيناء المصريه، لكن الضغط العالمي على اسرائيل اضطرها للانسحاب منها.\nحيث حدث في ربيع 1956 عدّه اصطدامات عسكريه بين مصر واسرائيل حدثت في قطاع غزه. اسرائيل اتّهمت مصر باستعمال المنطقه كقاعده للغارات الفدائيه على اسرائيل. في اكتوبر/تشرين الاول 1956، هاجمت اسرائيل منطقه قناه السويس في مصر بالتعاون مع فرنسا وبريطانيا، استولت القوّات الاسرائيليه على قطاع غزه وتقدّمت الى سيناء.\nفي مارس/اذار التالي، حلّت قوات طوارئ الامم المتحده محل القوات الاسرائيليه، ومصر استعادت السيطره على الاداره المدنيه للشريط. واعيد احتلال المدينه في حرب السته ايام (5 يونيو 1967 - 10 يونيو 1967).\n\nالنكسه\nسقطت المدينه في يد اسرائيل بعد عام 1967، لتظل تحت الاحتلال لمده 27 سنه وتعاني من الاهمال الاسرائيلي لها كباقي المدن العربيه الفلسطينيه المحتله. وقد صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات شائعه من اراضي غزه واقامت عليها العديد من المستوطنات.\nكانت مساحه المستوطنات الاسرائيليه في قطاع غزه تبلغ 155 كيلومترا مربعاً تقريباً، وبالنسبه للكتله المحيطه بمدينه غزه، وهي الكتله الشماليه، فتتوزع المستوطنات التي تتصل باسرائيل عبر طرق عرضيه تضمن لها سهوله الاتصال، تضم:\n\nمستوطنه ايرتز: (انشئت عام 1968م) على الحدود الشماليه لقطاع غزه مباشره.\nمستوطنه ايلي سيناي: تقع على بعد 1 كم الى الشرق من شاطئ البحر ملاصقه تماما لحدود قطاع غزه الشماليه، وهي مستوطنه زراعيه انشئت عام 1983 لاستيعاب عددا من المستوطنين الذين تم اجلاؤهم من سيناء في اعقاب اتفاقيه السلام المصريه ـ الاسرائيليه.\nمستوطنه نيسانيت: (انشئت عام 1982م) على بعد 5 كم شرق البحر، وهي مستوطنه زراعيه، انشئت لتستوعب اعدادا من المستوطنين الذين تم اجلاؤهم من سيناء.\nمستوطنه نتساريم: انشئت عام 1972 م لتقسم قطاع غزه الى قسمين شمالي وجنوبي، فهي تقع على بعد 1 كم الى الشرق من شاطئ البحر، وعلى بعد 1 كم الى الغرب من الطريق الرئيس، وعلى بعد 4 كم جنوب غزه، ونظرا لاتساع مساحه هذه المستوطنه، وموقعها المتميز جنوبي مدينه غزه، والمشاكل الناجمه عن هذه المستوطنه، جعلت منها كتله استيطانيه قائمه بذاتها.\nفي ديسمبر 1987، انخرط سكان غزه مبكرًا في الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الاولى (انتفاضه الحجاره) وكانت القياده الوطنيه الموحده للانتفاضه، تقوم بتوزيع النشرات الاسبوعيه في شوارع غزه مع جدول زمني للاضراب المتصاحب مع الاحتجاجات اليوميه ضد الدوريات الاسرائيليه في المدينه. وفي المظاهرات، تم احراق الاطارات في الشوارع، كما القى الحشود الحجاره والزجاجات الحارقه على جنود الاحتلال. ورد الجيش الاسرائيلي بالغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي. واغلقت المدارس في مدينه غزه قسرا، وفتحت تدريجيا لبضع ساعات. ونفذت الاعتقالات خارج البيوت، وفرض حظر التجول ومنع السفر، ما اعتبره الفلسطينيون بانه عقاب جماعي. ردا على اغلاق المدارس، وتنظيم دورات تعليم سكان المنزل لمساعده الطلاب على استدراك الماده الفائته، وهذا اصبح واحدا من الرموز القليله من العصيان المدني.\nيشار بالذكر الى ان قوات الاحتلال الاسرائيليه قد انسحبت من قطاع غزه في 15 اب / اغسطس 2005 وذلك بقرار من رئيس الوزراء الاسرائيلي اريئيل شارون بعد انشاءها منذ 38 عاما، تم بعدها تفكيك 21 مستوطنه بقطاع غزه و4 مستوطنات بالضفه الغربيه.\n\nالسلطه الفلسطينيه\nبقيت المدينه تحت الاحتلال الاسرائيلي حتى عام 1994، حيث انه في سبتمبر 1993، بعد مُفاوضات سريه، وقّع كل من رئيس وزراء اسرائيل اسحاق رابين ورئيس منظمه التحرير الفلسطينيه ياسر عرفات اتفاقيه اعلان مبادئ التي تقر انسحاب اسرائيل من قطاع غزه ومناطق اخرى، وتحويل اداره الحكومه المحليه للفلسطينيين، وفي مايو 1994، انسحبت القوات الاسرائيليه من المدينه ومن القطاع بشكل جزئي تاركه عده مستوطنات لها تحت امره الجيش الاسرائيلي في عمق القطاع، وتولت بموجب اتفاقيه اوسلو السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه اداره المدينه بعد ان كانت تتخذها قوات الجيش الاسرائيلي مقرًا لها اثناء احتلال قطاع غزه ما بين 1967 و1994، واصبحت منطقه قطاع غزه جُزئيًا تحت حكم السلطه الفلسطينيه، الا ان قطاع غزه ظل فعليًا تحت الاحتلال الاسرائيلي الى ان انسحبت اسرائيل بالكامل من اراضي قطاع غزه في 15 اغسطس 2005 باوامر من رئيس الوزراء الاسرائيلي وقتها اريئيل شارون وابقت على حصارها برًا وبحرًا وجوًا.\nبعد فوز حركه حماس بعدد كبير من مقاعد البرلمان الفلسطيني في الانتخابات اندلعت العديد من المناوشات المتفرقه بين عناصر من حركتي فتح وحماس ووصل الامر ذروته في منتصف يونيو من عام 2007 حيث قامت حركه حماس بالسيطره على كامل قطاع غزه والمؤسسات الامنيه والحكوميه فيه.\n\nوفي نهايه عام 2008 وبدايه عام 2009 وتحديدا بدءا من 27 ديسمبر 2008، بدات اسرائيل حرب عدوانيه شرسه على قطاع غزه بدات بالقصف الجوي العنيف لجميع مقرات الشرطه الفلسطينيه ثم تتالى القصف لمده اسبوع للمنازل والمساجد وحتى المستشفيات وبعد اسبوع بدات بالزحف البري الى الاماكن المفتوحه في حمله عسكريه عدوانيه غاشمه كان هدفها حسب ما اعلن قاده الاحتلال الصهيوني هو انهاء حكم حركه المقاومه الاسلاميه حماس، والقضاء على المقاومه الفلسطينيه لا سيما اطلاق الصواريخ محليه الصنع مثل صاروخ القسام او صواريخ روسيه او صينيه مثل صاروخ غراد التي وصل مداها خلال الحرب الى 50 كم، واستُخدمت القوات الصهيونيه الاسلحه والقذائف المحرمه دوليًا مثل القنابل الفسفوريه المسرطنه والقنابل اجله التفجير وغيرها.\nحاصرت القوات الاسرائيليه قطاع غزه، وقطعت عنها الكهرباء والوقود، وحرمت المرضى من الادويه، ومنعت الدول العربيه المُجاوره من ادخال الوقود الى القطاع، وما زال الحصار مفروضًا على القطاع حتى الان، وقد قتل كثير من الفلسطينيين من جراء الاشتباكات والتوغلات الاسرائيليه في القطاع، لا سيما حين قصفت مخيم جباليا شمالي قطاع غزه بالصواريخ وتوغلت فيه.\nنزح كثير من الفلسطينيين الى معبر رفح املين ان يدخلوا الى الاراضي المصريه ليبحثوا عن السلام، لكن الاداره المصريه منعت النازحين من الدخول الى الاراضي المصريه، وقد كسر النازحون معبر رفح في شهر مارس ودخلوا الى الاراضي المصريه وما زالوا يعانون من اثار الحصار الى الان.\nوتحاول منظمات انسانيه دوليه كسر الحصار المفروض على غزه من خلال ارسال سفن بها عدد من النشطاء، محمله بالمساعدات الانسانيه، الا ان اسرائيل تمنع وصول تلك السفن، ومن تلك المحاولات اسطول الحريه عام 2010،  وما تعرض له من هجوم عسكري اسرائيلي.\n\nفي نوفمبر 2012، اقدمت اسرائيل على الهجوم على غزه بقصف عشوائي استهدف في بادئ الامر احد قاده حماس، الاّ انه طال المدنيين بشكل رئيسي، ونتج عنه العشرات من الضحايا. وقد ردّت المقاومه الفلسطينيه بشكل غير مسبوق عبر قصفها لمدن في العمق الاسرائيلي كتل ابيب، وهرتسيليا وبئر السبع بعشرات الصواريخ.\nفي صيف 2014، شنت اسرائيل حربًا اخرى على غزه، فبدءا من يوم 8 يوليو 2014 بدا الجيش الاسرائيلي عمليه الجرف الصامد وردت كتائب عز الدين القسام بمعركه العصف الماكول  وردت حركه الجهاد الاسلامي بعمليه البنيان المرصوص وذلك بعد موجه عنف تفجرت مع خطف وتعذيب وحرق الطفل محمد ابو خضير من شعفاط على ايدي مجموعه مستوطنين في 2 يوليو 2014،، واعاده اعتقال العشرات من محرري صفقه شاليط، واعقبها احتجاجات واسعه في القدس وداخل عرب 48 وكذلك مناطق الضفه الغربيه، واشتدت وتيرتها بعد ان دهس اسرائيلي اثنين من العمال العرب قرب حيفا، وتخلل التصعيد قصف متبادل بين اسرائيل والمقاومه الفلسطينيه في قطاع غزه. تخلل هذه الحرب عده عمليات عسكريه مثل عمليه ناحل عوز وعمليه العاشر من رمضان.\n\nالجغرافيا\nيقع وسط غزه على تله بارتفاع 45 قدما (14 متر) فوق مستوى البحر. بُنيت جزء كبير من المدينه الحديثه على طول السهل اسفل التل، وخصوصا في الشمال والشرق، وتشكّل ضواحي غزه. يقع كل من شاطئ وميناء غزه على بعد 3 كم (1,9 ميل) عن مركز مدينه غزه. تبعد مدينه غزه 78 كيلومترًا (48 ميل) الى الجنوب الغربي من القدس، و 71 كيلومترًا (44 ميل) جنوب تل ابيب،  وعلى بعد 30 كيلومترًا (19 ميل) شمال مدينه رفح. مواقع محيطه تشمل بيت لاهيا وبيت حانون، وجباليا الى الشمال، وقريه ابو مدين، ومخيم البريج ومخيم النصيرات ومدينه دير البلح الى الجنوب.\nتبلغ مساحه الاراضي التابعه للبلديه ما يُقارب 45 كم مربع (17 ميل مربع). في الانتداب البريطاني، شكلت المناطق الحضريه (المبنيه) ما يقارب 7,960 كيلو متر مربع (3070 ميل مربع) اما المناطق الريفيه شكلت 143,063 كيلو متر مربع (55,237 ميل مربع). بلغت مساحه الاراضي المرويه 24,040 كم مربع (9,280 ميل مربع) والاراضي المزروعه بالحبوب حيث بلغت مساحتها 117,899 كم مربع (45,521 ميل مربع).\n\nيعتمد سكان غزه على المياه الجوفيه كمصدر وحيد للشرب والاستخدام الزراعي والمنزلي. يعد وادي غزه اقرب جدول مائي جنوبا. والذي يحتوي على كميه قليله من الماء في الشتاء اما صيفا فيكاد لا يحتوي على ماء. يتم تحويل معظم امدادات المياه فيها الى اسرائيل. المياه الجوفيه على طول ساحل قطاع غزه هو الخزان الرئيسي للماء في قطاع غزه وتتكون معظمها من الحجر الرملي العصر الجليدي. مثل معظم قطاع غزه، مغطى غزه بتراب رباعي.\nالمعادن الطينيه في التربه تمتص الكثير من المواد الكيميائيه العضويه وغير العضويه والتي قد خففت جزئيًا مدى تلوث المياه الجوفيه. تله معروفه في جنوب شرق غزه تسمى (المنطار) وهو ذات ارتفاع 270 قدم (82 م) فوق مستوى سطح البحر.\n\nمناطق المدينه\nتشكل البلده القديمه جزء رئيسي من نواه غزه. وتتكون من حي الدرج في الشمال (المعروف ايضًا باسم الحي مسلم) وحي الزيتون في الجنوب. تعود مُعظم المباني الى العصر المملوكي او العصر العثماني وبُنيت على بعض المباني القديمه. وتبلغ مساحه البلده القديمه حوالي 1,6 كيلومتر مربع (0.62 ميل مربع). تتكون غزه من 11 حي، يقع حي الدرج وحي الصبره ما بين حي الرمال والبلده القديمه.\n\nحي الشجاعيه: من اكبر احياء مدينه غزه، وينقسم الى قسمين الشجاعيه الجنوبيه (التركمان) والشجاعيه الشماليه (الجديده)، بُنى خلال عهد الايوبيين، يسكنه اكثر من 300 الف نسمه، ويعمل معظم سكانه بصناعات خفيفه مثل الخياطه والزراعه وغيرها كما انه يمتاز بانه منطقه تجاريه فيها كل الاشكال التجاريه والورش، به مقبرتان القديمه، ومقبره الشهداء، وبه اكبر منطقه صناعيه في غزه، وبه معبر المنطار التجاري. وقد شهد هذا الحي العديد من الاجتياحات الاسرائيليه.\nحي التفاح: تعود هذه التسميه لكثره اشجار التفاح التي كانت تنتشر في هذا الحي وهو من الاحياء القديمه بمدينه غزه.\nحي الرمال: ويعتبر من ارقى احياء مدينه غزه واكبرها مساحه بُني في ثلاثينيات واربعينيات القرن 20، وينقسم الي الرمال الشمالي والجنوبي. ويمتد الشمالي منه من بدايه حي الشيخ رضوان (الشارع الاول) الى شارع المختار والرمال الجنوبي من شارع عمر المختار الى بدايه حي تل الهوى.\nحي النصر: سُمي الحي بالنصر احترامًا للجمال عبد الناصر الذي بُني في خمسينيات القرن 20.\nحي الزيتون: سمي بذلك لكثره اشجار الزيتون المزروعه فيه، ولكن تم اقتلاع وتجريف الكثير منها خلال انتفاضه الاقصى وبخاصه في الحرب الاخيره من قبل الجيش الاسرائيلي على قطاع غزه بتاريخ 27/12/2008 م، ويعتبر حي الزيتون احد اكبر احياء مدينه غزه، حيث يقطنه اكثر من 100 الف نسمه.\nحي الدرج: وكان يسمى سابقاً «حي بني عامر» نسبه لقبيله بني عامر العربيه التي سكنته مع بدايه الفتح الاسلامي ثم حي«البرجليه» نسبه للمحاربين المدافعين عن ابراج المدينه في العصر المملوكي.\nحي الصبره: من احياء غزه القديمه نسبيًا ويقع بعد شارع الثلاثيني.\nحي الشيخ رضوان: يمتد من الشارع الاول الى الشارع الثالث شمالاً ومن شارع النصر غرباً ومن قريه جباليا النزله شرقاً ويقع الحي على بعد 3 كيلومتر (1.9 ميل) شمال البلده القديمه.\nحي تل الهوى: وهو احد الاحياء الجديده وبرزت فيه العماره بعد قدوم السلطه الفلسطينيه الى غزه حيث اقيمت اغلب المؤسسات الحكوميه في هذا الحي، وعند قدوم حكومه حركه المقاومه الاسلاميه حماس عن طريق الانتخابات قامت بتسميته بتل الاسلام، لكن لم تنجح في ذلك، وبقي الناس ينادوه بتل الهوى.\nحي الشيخ عجلين: هو حي يقع في جنوب مدينه غزه بالقرب من الطريق الساحلي. في 18 نوفمبر 2002، هاجمت قوات الدفاع الاسرائيليه الحي، ودمّرت مكاتب جهاز الامن الوقائي التابع للسلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه.\nحي الدرج\nالمخيمات\n\nمخيم جباليا: يقع شمال مدينه غزه ويعتبر اكبر المخيمات ولكنه يتبع لمحافظه شمال غزه وليس لمحافظه غزه.\nمخيم الشاطئ: يقع غرب المدينه مقابلاً للساحل.\nمخيم النصيرات: يقع على بعد 8 كم جنوب مدينه غزه وعلى بعد 6 كم شمال بلده دير البلح ويقع المخيم في وسط قطاع غزه\n\nالمناخ\nتمتاز غزه بمناخ متوسطي وشتاء معتدل جاف، والصيف حار ساخن. يبدا فصل الربيع في شهر مارس ابريل واكثر الشهور حراره يوليو واغسطس. اما متوسط ارتفاع درجات الحراره يبلغ 33 سلسيوس (91 درجه فهرنهايت). ويعد شهر يناير ابرد شهور السنه متوسط الدرجات الحراره المنخفضه يبلغ 7 سلسيوس (45 درجه فهرنهايت). الامطار شحيحه وتهطل بين شهري نوفمبر ومارس، ويبلغ معدل الامطار السنويه قرابه (116 ملم). وتهب الرياح على المدينه من الناحيه الجنوبيه الغربيه. يصل اعلى معدل لسرعه الرياح في الشتاء الى 60 كم في الساعه (نحو 7.3 عقده/ساعه)، واعلى سرعه للرياح في كامل السنه هي في شهر يناير بنحو 7.6 عقده/ساعه، وقد ترجع هذه السرعه الى مرور المنخفضات الجويه التي عاده ما تصاحبها رياح شديده. تبلغ سرعه الرياح ادنى معدلاتها في فصل الصيف، فيبلغ المتوسط الفصلي حوالي 5 عقده/ساعه، وينخفض متوسط سرعه الرياح في فصل الربيع عما هو في فصل الشتاء ليبلغ 6.7 عقده/ساعه، وتقل سرعه الرياح في الخريف عن فصل الشتاء والربيع بينما تزيد عن فصل الصيف اذ تبلغ 5.6 عقده/ساعه.\n\nالسكان\nوفقا للاحصاءات العثمانيه في عام 1557، كان عدد الذكور 2477. حسب الاحصائيات عام 1596 اظهرت ان عدد المسلمين كان كالتالي (456 اسره، 115 عزاب، 59 شخص ديني و19 شخص من ذو الاحتياجات الخاصه). اضف الى اعداد المسلمين، كان عدد الجنود العثمانيون 119 جندي. اما المسيحين كان عدد الاسر 294 اسره و7 اشخاص عزاب، بينما كان عدد الاسر اليهوديه ما يقارب 73 اسره و8 اسر من السامريون. في المجموع، بلغ عدد سكان غزه 6,000 نسمه وكانت في المركز الثالث كبراً من حيث عدد السكان في فلسطين العثمانيه بعد القدس وصفد.\nفي عام 1838، كان عدد المسلمين 4,000 نسمه و 100 من المسيحيين (دافعين للضرائب مقابل حمايتهم) وبالتالي بلغ عدد السكان النهائي 15,000 او 16,000 نسمه واصبحت اكبر من القدس من حيث عدد السكان في ذلك الوقت. العدد الكامل للاسر المسيحيه بلغ 57 اسره. قبل الحرب العالميه الاولى بلغ عدد سكان غزه حوالي 42,000 نسمه، وادى القتال ما بين القوات العثمانيه والالمانيه وقوات التحالف الى انخفاض اعداد سكان غزه.\nحسب الاحصائيات عام 1997، من قبل الجهاز المركزي للاحصاء الفلسطيني بلغ عدد سكان غزه مع مخيم الشاطئ 353,115 منهم 50,9% ذكور و49,1% اناث. تمتاز غزه بكثره الشباب بنسبه 60,8% وتتراوح اعمارهم ما بين (0-19 سنه). 28,8% من السكان تتراوح اعمارهم (20-44 سنه)، 7,7% ما بين (45-64 سنه)، وبلغت نسبه الذين تجاوزت اعمارهم 64 عام 3,9%.\nبلغ عدد سكان غزه 590,400 نسمه. سكان مدينه غزه وفلسطين عامه ينحدرون من اصول ساميه، وكجميع سكان البحر الابيض المتوسط لهم ملامح عربيه سمراء ومتنوعه لا تخلو من تاثيرات متوسطيه.\nفي سنتي 2023 و2024 مارست قوت الاحتلال الاسرائيلي قصفا مباشرا على السكان المدنيين حيث قتلت ما يزيد عن 40 الف فلسطيني جلهم نساء واطفال من سكان غزه\n\nالدين\nينتمي معظم سكان غزه الى الدين الاسلامي السني. عندما كانت غزه تتبع الدوله الفاطميه، كان الشيعه مسيطرين على غزه، ولكن بعدما استرجعها القائد صلاح الدين الايوبي رقي بالنهج السني بصرامه دينيه وتعليميه، مما كان له دور في توحيد جنوده العربي والترك.\nتوجد اقليه صغيره من المسيحيين الفلسطينيين حوالي 3,500 نسمه تعيش في المدينه. وغالبيه من المسيحيين تعيش في غزه في حي الزيتون في المدينه القديمه، وينتمون الى الارثوذكسيه الشرقيه من القدس، والروم الكاثوليك، والطوائف المعمدانيه. في عام 1906، لم يكن هناك سوى 750 مسيحي، منهم 700 شخص يتبعون الارثوذكسيه و50 يتبعون الكنيسه الرومانيه الكاثوليكيه.\nاستوطن اليهود غزه منذ زمن،  في اسره يهوديه تعيش في غزه  غادر معظمهم من قطاع غزه بعد الثوره الفلسطينيه 1929، حينما تكون مجتمعهم من خمسين اسره. في احصائيات سامي هداوي للاراضي والسكان، كان عدد سكان غزه 34,250 نسمه، في عام 1945. غادر معظمهم من المدينه بعد حرب عام 1948، وذلك بسبب انعدام الثقه المتبادله بينهم وبين الاغلبيه العربيه.\nتحتوي غزه على العديد من مباني العباده القديمه من ابرزها الجامع العمري، كنيسه القديس برفيريوس ومسجد السيد هاشم حيث يرقد قبر جد الرسول محمد.\n\nالاقتصاد\nكانت المدينه ولا زالت مركزًا مُهمًا من حيث موقعها الاستراتيجي بين القارتين الاسيويه والافريقيه ووقوعها على شاطئ البحر الابيض المتوسط الذي يجعل منها ميناء مهما للتجاره واعمال الصيد، ولكن صعوبه نقل البضائع عبر المعابر مع اسرائيل وعدم سلاسه النقل مع مصر يجعل حجم التبادل التجاري ضئيلًا مع الحجم المفترض بسبب الموقع الجغرافي. نما الاقتصاد في غزه بنسبه 8% في الاشهر ال 11 الاولى من عام 2010، وبنسبه 5.4% في عام 2009، والنشاط الاقتصادي مدعوم الى حد كبير من خلال التبرعات والمساعدات الخارجيه، والذي يعتبر السبب الرئيسي وراء النمو الذي حدث مؤخرا. غزه مثلها كمثل اي مدينه فلسطينيه لا تملك عمله وطنيه، ويُستخدم الدينار الاردني والدولار الامريكي والشيكل الاسرائيلي. ويبلغ معدل الناتج المحلي للفرد 1,763 دولار امريكي (طبـقًا لاحصائيه 1997).\nبعد اتفاق اوسلو، تم توظيف الالاف من السكان في مختلف الوزارات والاجهزه الامنيه، في حين قامت وكاله الغوث والمنظمات الدوليه المختلفه التي تدعم تطوير المدينه بتوظيف اخرين.\nيوجد في غزه نقص خطير في مجال الاسكان والمرافق التعليميه والمرافق الصحيه والبنيه التحتيه وعدم كفايه نظام الصرف الصحي، وقد ساهمت كل منها بتهديد النظافه وانشاء مشاكل في الصحه العامه. هُناك عدد من الفنادق في غزه، مثل فندق فلسطين والقصر الكبير وادم والامل والقدس وكليف والديره وبيت مارنا. تقع الفنادق على طول حي الرمال باستثناء فندق فلسطين. لدى الامم المتحده نادي الشاطئ في الشارع نفسه. غزه ليست مقصد للسُياح، مُعظم الاجانب يقيمون في الفنادق وهم صحفيين وعمال الاغاثه والامم المتحده والعاملين في الصليب الاحمر. الفنادق الراقيه تشمل فندق القدس والديره.\nووفقًا لتقرير صدر مؤخرًا عن منظمه اوكسفام، تبلغ نسبه البطاله في غزه ما يقارب 40% ومن المُتوقع ان تصل الى 50%. وقد دُمر القطاع الخاص الذي يؤمن بدوره 53% من جميع الوظائف في غزه، وقد افلست الشركات، بالاضافه الى ان 75,000 عامل من اصل 110,000 هم الان من دون وظيفه. في عام 2008، تم تعليق 95% من العمليات الصناعيه في غزه بسبب عدم وجود المواد الخام للانتاج وعدم القُدره على تصدير ما يُنتج. في يونيو 2005، بلغ عدد المصانع في غزه 3,900 مصنع التي تُوظف 35,000 شخص، ولكن بحلول ديسمبر 2007، لم يبقَ سوى 195 مصنعًا التي تُوظف 1,700 شخص. اُصيبت صناعه البناء والتشييد بالشلل مع عشرات الالاف من العاطلين عن العمل. كما اُصيب القطاع الزراعي باضرارًا جسيمه وقرابه 40,000 عاملًا لا يحصلون على اي دخل وكانوا يعتمدون على الزراعه كمحصول نقدي.\nفي اغسطس 2009، وعدت حماس كل عامل ب100 دولار في شهر رمضان الكريم. ادى زياده الازدهار نوعًا ما الى استبدال واسع للعربات التي تجرها الحمير بالتوك توك. ووفقًا لصندوق النقد الدولي، انخفض معدل البطاله ونما الاقتصاد بنسبه 16% في النصف الاول من عام 2010، تقريبًا ضعف سرعه نمو الاقتصاد في الضفه الغربيه.\n الزراعه \n\nاشتهرت غزه قديماً بزراعه محاصيل القمح والشعير والقطن والزيتون. وتصديرها الى العالم العربي والخارجي، وفي غزه الان العديد من المزروعات وهي: البطاطا، والطماطم، والخيار، والعنب، والفراوله، والتين، والبطيخ، والشمام. وانتشرت فيها البيارات التي تزرع فيها اجود انواع الحمضيات كالليمون والبرتقال، والتي يعتمد البعض عليها في تغذيه النحل.\nويعتمد الري في مدينه غزه على مياه الابار، ويجري حالياً دراسات لتحليه مياه البحر تقوم بها البلديات في قطاع غزه. كما يعتمد الاقتصاد في غزه بدرجه كبيره على زراعه وتصدير الازهار الى مختلف دول العالم.\nويربي بعض سكان القطاع حالياً الاغنام والماشيه، ويعتمدون عليها في تسيير امور حياتهم، والتي تسهم كذلك في بعض الصناعات المحليه الخفيفه؛ فقد ساهمت بلديه غزه بانشاء مسلخ حديث ومتطور يتبع احدث القوانين الصحيه والعمليه ويعمل اوتوماتيكياً حسب احدث النظم والاساليب في العالم، ويعتبر من اكثر المسالخ تطوراً في الشرق الاوسط.\n الصناعه \nتشتهر غزه بصناعه عصر الزيتون والصابون الذي يعتمد على الزيت كماده اوليه كما تعتبر صناعه الفخار من اقدم الصناعات الفلسطينيه التي اشتهرت بها المدينه والتي تُباع في شوارع اسواق غزه، وكذلك صناعه الغزل والتطريز والبسط التراثيه من صوف الماشيه والنسيج والملابس القطنيه والاثاث المصنوع من الخيزران وصناعه الزجاج الملون كذلك. فقد تم انشاء قريه الفنون والحرف التي بُنِيَت من الطين على الطراز المعماري القديم، ويمارس عد من الحرفيين الصناعه التقليديه في تلك القريه. وافتُتَح مول غزه الحديث في يوليو 2010.\n\nالسياحه\nتعتمد السياحه في غزه بشكل رئيسي على البحر الذي تشتهر شواطئه برمالها الذهبيه البراقه. كما وتعتمد السياحه كذلك على المواقع الاثريه التاريخيه المنتشره في غزه. وتشتهر غزه كذلك بجوها المعتدل صيفاً وشتاءً والذي يشجع الناس بدوره، على ارتياد الشواطئ والحدائق والمنتزهات وعلى قضاء اوقاتهم في المزارع والبيارات وفي المرافق السياحيه.\nتضم غزه العديد من الاثار منها الرومانيه والمسيحيه، وتتنوع الاثار الاسلاميه بين المساجد والمدارس والزوايا والاسواق والقيساريات والاسبله والحمامات والقصور التي تجلت فيها روعه العماره والفنون الاسلاميه، علاوه على مكتبه مهمه احتوت على عديد من المخطوطات.\nان اقدم المواقع الاثريه بغزه تل العجول بجنوب المدينه على الضفه الشماليه لوادى غزه، وكان على هذا الموقع مدينه بيت جلايم الكنعانيه، ويعتقد ان موقع مدينه غزه القديمه كانت على هذا التل منذ 2000 ق.م. وتضم غزه اثاراً مسيحيه مثل دير القديس هيلاريون الذي يعتبر مؤسس حياه الرهبنه في فلسطين وكنيسه الروم الارثوذكس بحى الزيتون الذي يعود تاريخها الى بدايه القرن الخامس الميلادي واثاراً اسلاميه متنوعه منها المساجد الاثريه كمسجد السيد هاشم الذي يقع بحى الدرج بالمنطقه الشماليه الذي يعود للعصر المملوكي، وجدده السلطان عبد الحميد سنه 1850 م. وتحوى غزه زوايا كالزاويه الاحمديه بحي الدرج، علاوه على المنشات الاثريه المدنيه كالاسواق مثل سوق القيساريه بحى الدرج، وهو ملاصق للجدار الجنوبي للجامع العمرى الكبير، ويعود بناء السوق الى العصر المملوكي، ويتكون من شارع مغطى بقبو مدبب، وعلى جانبي هذا الشارع حوانيت صغيره مغطاه باقبيه متقاطعه يطلق عليه سوق القيساريه او سوق الذهب نسبه الى تجاره الذهب فيه، والقصور مثل قصر الباشا بحي الدرج المكون من طابقين، ويعود للعصر المملوكي وكان مقراً لنائب غزه في العصرين المملوكي والعثماني، والحمامات كحمام السمره بحي الزيتون، وهو احد النماذج الرائعه الباقيه للحمامات العثمانيه في فلسطين والحمام الوحيد الباقي لغايه الان في مدينه غزه.\nوكذلك تل الرقيش الذي اكتُشف فيه مستعمره تعود للعهد الفينيقي في هذا التل تحيطها اسوار دفاعيه ضخمه ويبلغ طولها حوالي (1600م).\n\nالثقافه\nالازياء والتطريز \nتعتبر غزه الموطن الاصلي الشاش، القماش من اجل «ثوب غزه» يتم نسجه بالقرب من المجدل (عسقلان). القطن الاسود او الازرق او المقلمه باللونان الزهري والاخضر، والتي تم تصنيعها في المجدل استمرت بالانتشار في باقي مناطق قطاع غزه من قبل اللاجئين من قرى السهل الساحلي حتى التسعينيات. يتميز الثوب الغزاوي باكمام ضيقه ومستقيمه. وكان التطريز اقل كثافه من تلك المطبقه في الخليل. ومن الزخرفيات تشمل: مقص، مشط وحجاب والتي رتبت في كثير من الاحيان في مجموعات ثلاثيه او خماسيه او سباعيه. ويعتبر استخدام الارقام الفرديه في الفولكلور العربي ان يكون فعالا ضد العين الحسود.\n المطبخ \nوقد تاثر المطبخ في قطاع غزه بالاكلات المجاوره حيث تاثرت بمصر بفضل موقعها على ساحل البحر المتوسط. الغذاء الرئيسي للغالبيه العظمى من سكان في المنطقه هو السمك. الصناعه الرئيسيه بغزه هي صيد الاسماك اما ان تكون مشويه او مقليه، وتتسم الاطعمه هناك باضافه الثوم والفلفل الاحمر والكمون ويتم نقعه في مزيج من الكزبره، الفلفل الاحمر، كمون، ثوم مفروم والليمون. التاثير المصري يظهر ايضا على جانب الاستخدام المُتكرر للفلفل الحار والثوم والشوندره نكهه لكثير من وجبات الطعام من قطاع غزه. الطبق الوطني لمنطقه غزه هو سماكيه.\nالمراكز الثقافيه والمتاحف\n\nتوجد في غزه عده مراكز ثقافيه منها مركز رشاد الشوا. تم الانتهاء من بناء مركز رشاد الشوا الثقافي في عام 1988 واطلق عليه اسم مؤسسه الامين السابق للمدينه ويقع في حي الرمال. البناء مكون من طابقان على شكل مثلث وتؤدي المراكز الثقافيه ثلاثه وظائف رئيسيه: مكان للتجمعات الكبيره خلال المهرجانات السنويه ومكان لتنظيم المعارض ومكتبه. المركز الثقافي الفرنسي هو رمز للتعاون والشراكه في قطاع غزه. تقدم المعارض الفنيه والحفلات الموسيقيه وعروض الافلام وغيرها من الانشطه. ويقدم دعوات للفنانين الفرنسيين لعرض اعمالهم الفنيه كلما امكن ذلك، ويقدم دعوات ايضًا الى الفنانين الفلسطينيين من قطاع غزه والضفه الغربيه للمشاركه في المسابقات الفنيه.\nانشئت في عام 1998 قريه الفنون والحرف وهي مركز ثقافي للاطفال التي تهدف الى التشجيع الشامل والمنتظم للفن الابداعي في جميع اشكاله. وتفاعل المركز مع فئه واسعه من الفنانين من جنسيات مختلفه، ونظم قرابه 100 معرض للفن الابداعي، والسيراميك، والرسومات، والمنحوتات وغيرها. وقد استفاد ما يقرب 10,000 طفل من مختلف انحاء قطاع غزه من قريه الفنون والحرف.\n\nالرياضه\nيقع ملعب فلسطين «الاستاد الوطني الفلسطيني»، في غزه ولديه القدره على استيعاب 10,000 شخصًا. وهو بمثابه موطن للمنتخب الفلسطيني لكره القدم، ولكن بعد غاره جويه اسرائيليه تضرر بشده ميدان الملعب، وقد لعبت مبارياته في الدوحه، قطر. تملك غزه الكثير من الانديه الرياضيه والتي تشارك في دوري قطاع غزه. وتشمل خدمات الشاطئ (مخيم الشاطئ)، اتحاد الشجاعيه، نادي غزه الرياضي ونادي الزيتون.\n\nالتعليم\nوفقًا للاحصاء الفلسطيني في عام 1997، كان اكثر من 90% من سكان غزه الذين تزيد اعمارهم على 10 يجيدون القراءه والكتابه. من سكان المدينه، كانوا 140,848 مسجلين في المدارس (39.8% في المدارس الابتدائيه، 33.8% في المدارس الثانويه، و 26.4% في المدارس الثانويه العامه). تلقى نحو 11,134 شخص شهادات البكالوريوس او الماجستير والدكتوراه.\nفي عام 2006، كان عدد المدارس في غزه 210، وتم تشغيل وبناء 151 منها من قبل وزاره التربيه والتعليم الفلسطينيه، و 46 من قبل وكاله الامم المتحده لاغاثه وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين في الشرق الادنى، و 13 مدرسه خاصه. التحق ما مجموعه 154,251 طالب وكانوا 5,877 يعملون مدرسين. اثر الاقتصاد المضطهد في الوقت الحالي في قطاع غزه. في سبتمبر 2007، كشف استطلاع للاونروا في قطاع غزه، ان الفشل ينتشر بنسبه 80% من الصف الرابع الى التاسع، وتصل نسبه الفشل في ماده الرياضيات الى 90%. في يناير 2008، افادت منظمه الامم المتحده للطفوله (يونيسف) ان المدارس في غزه قامت بالغاء الفئات التي كانت عاليه في استهلاك الطاقه، مثل تكنولوجيا المعلومات، ومختبرات العلوم والانشطه اللاصفيه.\nيوجد في مدينه غزه عده جامعات وهي: الجامعه الاسلاميه-غزه، جامعه الازهر-غزه، جامعه الاقصى-غزه (كليه التربيه سابقا)، جامعه فلسطين وجامعه الامه وجامعه القدس المفتوحه وهي تعتمد نظام التعليم المفتوح وتضم حوالي 40,000 طالباً. تاسست الجامعه الاسلاميه، التي تتالف من عشره كليات، من قبل احمد ياسين ومجموعه من رجال الاعمال في عام 1978، مما يجعلها اول مؤسسه للتعليم العالي في قطاع غزه. في (2006-2007)، فقد بلغ عدد الملتحقين بها 20,021 طالب وطالبه. جامعه الازهر في غزه والتي تاسست عام 1991، وتاسست جامعه الاقصى في عام 1991. بدات جامعه القدس المفتوحه تعليمها في مبنى مستاجر في وسط المدينه وكان ذلك عام 1992 وكان عدد الملتحقين بها 730 طالب وطالبه. بسبب الزياده السريعه في عدد الطلاب، تم تشيد اول مبنى جامعي في منطقه ناصر. في (2006-2007)، فقد بلغ عدد الملتحقين بها 3,778 طالب.\nوتقع المكتبه العامه في قطاع غزه قباله شارع الوحده، وتحتوي على ما يقارب 10,000 كتابًا في العربيه والانكليزيه والفرنسيه. ويبلغ مجموع مساحتها حوالي 1410 متر مربع (15,200 قدم مربعه)، ويتكون المبنى من دورين وسرداب. افتتحت المكتبه في عام 1999، بعد تعاون رئيس بلديه غزه عون الشوا وبلديه دونكيرك، والبنك الدولي. الاهداف الرئيسيه للمكتبه تتمثل بتوفير مصادر المعلومات لتلبيه احتياجات المستفيدين، وتوفير التسهيلات اللازمه من اجل الوصول الى مصادر المعلومات المتاحه، وتنظيم برامج ثقافيه متنوعه مثل النشاطات الثقافيه والندوات والمحاضرات والعروض السينمائيه والفيديو والفن ومعارض للكتب. وكذلك يوجد بها العديد من المراكز المهنيه والتدريبيه التابعه لوزاره التعليم العالي ووكاله الغوث.\n\nمشاكل التعليم في قطاع غزه\nهناك العديد من المشاكل التي تواجه التعليم في قطاع غزه متمثله في الاتي:\n- الاكتظاظ الطلابي الكبير في الفصول الدراسيه نتيجه لازدياد عدد الطلاب وقله عدد المدارس. حيث ادت الحروب المتتاليه الي تدمير المدارس، وادي الحصار الخانق الي صعوبه اعاده اعمارها\n- تعتبر المعابر من المشاكل التعليم في قطاع غزه. حيث استمرار اغلاق المعابر لفترات طويله يؤدي الي صعوبه التنقل للخارج واستكمال الدراسه\n- من المشاكل الاخرى التي تؤثر سلبا على التعليم مشكله التيار الكهربائي. حيث ادي الانقطاع المستمر للتيار الكهربائي بمعدل 8 ساعات يوميا الي صعوبه مواكبه الطلاب دراستهم وواجباتهم اليوميه.\n\nالمعالم\nالبنيه التحتيه\nالخدمات\nامدادات المياه والصرف الصحي\nووفقًا لتعداد المكتب المركزي للاحصاء الفلسطيني عام 1997، فقد كان 98,1% من سكان غزه يملُكون امدادات المياه العامه في حين ان البقيه يستخدمون النظام الخاص. تم ربط حوالي 87.6% الى نظام الصرف الصحي العام و 11.8% يستخدمون البالوعه.\nبسبب القيود الشديده التي فُرضت على امدادات المياه في غزه، ونظام الصرف بها. لم تعد تعمل الابار السته الرئيسيه لمياه الشرب، وحوالي 50% من السكان لا يحصُلون على المياه بشكل منتظم. يتسرب يوميًا حوالي 20 مليون لتر من مياه الصرف الصحي الخام و40 مليون لتر من المياه المعالجه جُزئيًا في البحر الابيض المتوسط نظرًا لقطع الكهرباء وعدم وجود الوقود وقطع الغيار في محطات المعالجه في قطاع غزه. وتزعم البلديه ان تراكم القمامه في الشوارع والطرق وفي الابار، وفيضانات مياه الصرف الصحي في تتسبب خطر تفشي الامراض والاوبئه الحشريه، وكذلك الفئران وفي المناطق السكنيه.\nالرعايه الصحيه\n\nتوجد في المدنيه عده مشافي منها مستشفى القدس، والذي يقع في حي تل الهوى، ويديرُه جمعيه الهلال الاحمر الفلسطيني، ويعد ثاني اكبر مستشفى في غزه.\nونتيجه القيود الصارمه على الوقود والكهرباء؛ تُعاني المستشفيات حاليًا من انقطاع التيار الكهربائي الدائم الذي يصل الى 8-12 ساعه يوميًا. يُوجد حاليًا نقص 60-70 في المئه في وقود الديزل اللازم لمولدات الكهرباء التي اُبلغ عنها. ووفقًا لمنظمه الصحه العالميه، تم رفض تصاريح مغادره 18.5% من المرضى الذين قدموا تصاريح لكي يتلقوا العلاج الطارئ في المستشفيات خارج قطاع غزه في عام 2007.\nالنقل والمواصلات\n\nيمتد شارع رشيد الساحلي والذي يمتد على طول ساحل غزه ويربطها مع بقيه الساحل الشمالي في قطاع غزه ومع جنوبه. الطريق الرئيسي في قطاع غزه، هو شارع صلاح الدين (فيا ماريس الحديثه) والذي يمر عبر وسط مدينه غزه، والذي يربط بدوره دير البلح وخان يونس ورفح في جنوب القطاع وجباليا وبيت حانون في شمال قطاع غزه. المعبر الشمالي من شارع صلاح الدين في اسرائيل هو معبر بيت حانون ومعبر من مصر هو معبر رفح. وقد تم اغلاق المعابر من قبل اسرائيل ومصر منذ عام 2007، ولكن بعد الثوره المصريه قد تم اعاده فتح معبر رفح ولن دون تغيرات تذكر.\nيعتبر شارع عمر المختار الشارع الرئيسي في مدينه غزه للتنقل من الشرق الى الغرب وبالعكس، وهو فرع من شارع صلاح الدين، والذي يمتد من ساحل الرمال في المدينه القديمه وينتهي في سوق الذهب. وقبل الحصار المفروض على قطاع غزه، كان هناك خطوط منتظمه لسيارات الاجره نحو مدينتان رام الله، القدس والخليل في الضفه الغربيه.\nمطار ياسر عرفات الدولي والذي تم افتتاحه عام 1998 بالقرب من مدينه رفح، ويقع على بعد 40 كم (25 ميل) جنوب قطاع غزه. تضررت المدارجات والمنشات التابعه للمطار الى حد كبير خلال الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه على يد الجيش الاسرائيلي وهو معطل عن العمل حالياً. يقع مطار بن غوريون الدولي في اسرائيل على بعد 75 كم (47 ميل) شمال شرق المدينه.، وبطبيعه الحال لا يمكن استخدامه من قبل المواطنين الفلسطينيين.\n\nمعاناه المدينه\nالحصار\n\nتقوم السلطات الاسرائيليه بحصار قطاع غزه وبالتالي المدينه حصاراً كاملاً حيث تمنع السفر من والى غزه وتمنع عنها مواد البناء والمواد التموينيه والادويه والمحروقات بانواعها، وقد دمر هذا الحصار الاقتصاد الغزاوي بشكل شبه كامل. وفي اوائل سنه 2009 بدات اسرائيل في ضرب قطاع غزه كاملاً. وقد زعمت اسرائيل بان حماس تهدد امنها وسكانها.\nولكن الشعب الفلسطيني ولم يستسلم وانما بادر بشق الانفاق عند حدود الاراضي المصريه، وساعدت هذه الانفاق بدخول جميع مستلزمات الحياه من مواد غذائيه ومواد بناء واسلحه واجهزه كهربائيه والسيارات. وبعد عام من شن اسرائيل الحرب على غزه قاموا بعقد عده اتفاقيات وتهدئات ساهمت بتهدئه الوضع في قطاع غزه وفتح معبر رفح والسماح للمُسافرين بالدخول والخروج من المدينه ولكن بتنسيق من حُكومه حماس المُقاله والسلطه المصريه.\nما زال المواطن الفلسطيني يعاني من ازمه الغلاء المعيشي بالاضافه للمعونات التي تقدم للمواطنين فهي تقدم فقط لعائلات معينه وليس للجميع. ومع ذلك فان سكان قطاع غزه يعيشون في نعيم اكثر من الضفه الغربيه باستثناء تواصل انقطاع التيار الكهربائي بحجه عدم وجود الوقود.\nمجزره غزه\n\nمجزره غزه او محرقه غزه هي عمليه اسرائيليه جرت في قطاع غزه على مدار خمسه ايام في شهر فبراير 2008 بدعوى القضاء على عناصر حركه حماس المطلقه للصواريخ على الاراضي الاسرائيليه. وقد جاءت هذه التسميه بعد ان وصف وزير الدفاع الاسرائيلي ايهود باراك ما تفعله القوات الاسرائيليه في غزه بهولوكوست او اباده عرقيه او محرقه للفلسطينيين في قطاع غزه اثر مقتل جنديين اسرائيليين على يد عناصر من حركه حماس اثناء مقاوماتها للقوات الاسرائيليه؛ فتبنى التسميه عدد كبير من الكتاب والمفكرين والشخصيات السياسيه والدينيه العرب والمسلمين، حيث يرونها اسم مناسب للعمليه، حيث راح ضحيتها 116 شخص من ضمنهم 26 طفلاً فضلاً عن غيرهم من المدنيين ما بين قتيل وجريح. وفي نفس اليوم الذي اعلنت فيه انتهاء العمليات العسكريه في غزه؛ اعلنت مصادر اسرائيليه انها كانت مرحله اولى، وانه قد تكون هناك عمليات اخرى في القريب.\nالعدوان شنته قوات الاحتلال منذ يوم 27 ديسمبر 2008 على قطاع غزه. وقد ذهب ضحيه لهذا العدوان حتى اليوم العشرون ما يزيد على 5,000 مدني شهيد اكثرهم من النساء والاطفال وما يقارب الـ 8,000 جريح من المدنيين، ومعظم الجرحى اصبحوا عاجزين اما اهل غزه فقد ظلوا صابرين يواجهون اكبر ترسانه عسكريه بصُدور عاريه وقُلوب ثابته في مواجهه 10,000 طن من القنابل القُيت عليهم ومنها قنابل محرمه دوليًا.\nوقد شهدت فتره العدوان اكبر انتفاضه عالميه ضد المجزره التي ترتكبها اسرائيل ضد اطفال ونساء وعجائز غزه، حيث عرضت وسائل الاعلام صوراً بشعه من غزه هزت العالم فنزلت الشعوب بمئات الالوف تبكي في الشوارع وتطالب بالتحرك لوقف العدوان والجرائم والمحارق والقنابل الاسرائيليه، واصبحت غزه مدينه عالميه ورمزاً فلسطينياً كبيراً. وقام بعض الفنانين العربيين والعالميين بابداء دعمهم وتاييدهم لنضال الغزاويين ومواساتهم في كارثتهم. ومنهم اول مغني امريكي يغني لغزه وهو مايكل هارت.\nوقد اعلن المسؤولون الاسرائيليون امتداد العمليات العسكريه «حسب الحاجه»، في الوقت الذي ما زالت فيه الدول العربيه تتجادل فيما بينها علي ضروره عقد قمه عربيه طارئه. علمًا بان قطر نادت بعقد قمه عربيه مُنذ بدايه العدوان الاسرائيلي على غزه لمُناصره الشعب فيها.\nوجاء هذا مصاحبا لمجهودات دوليه تندد بالهجمات بوصفها هجمات همجيه ووحشيه وغير انسانيه البته وقد قامت مظاهرات غاضبه في بلدان العالم تندد بالمجزره. وبعد مرور 22 يوماً توقفت الحرب وانسحبت قوات الصهاينه مهزومه لانها لم تحقق اهدافها. وخلفت وراءها اكثر من 5000 شهيد واكثر من 8000 جريح واكثر من 20000 منزل مدمر.\nالجدار الفولاذي\n\nفي ديسمبر 2009، اعلنت مصر عزمها بناء الجدار الفولاذي تحت الارض بين رفح المصريه وقطاع غزه يصل الى عمق 30 مترًا وطول 10 كم، من اجل وقف تسلل الفلسطينيين وتهريب السلاح الى الاراضي المصريه، ووقف تهريب البضائع المصريه بمُختلف انواعها للاراضي المحتله.\nحيث ان الهدف من انشاء هذا الجدار العازل هو القضاء على الانفاق التي تصل بين مصر وقطاع غزه، وحيث ان هذه الانفاق هي المدخل الوحيد الان لكل احتياجات الشعب الفلسطيني في قطاع غزه بعد ان فرضت مصر الحصار على معبر رفح وهو المنفذ الوحيد لغزه على العالم، وضيقت الخناق على اهل غزه، وهناك قضيه مرفوعه الان في مصر ضد قانونيه هذا الجدار.\n\nالحكومه\nاليوم، تُعد غزه العاصمه الاداريه لمحافظه غزه. وتحتوي على مبنى المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني، وكذلك المقر الرئيسي لمعظم وزارات السلطه الفلسطينيه.\nتم تشكيل اول مجلس بلدي في غزه عام 1893 برئاسه علي خليل الشوا. قامت السلطات العثمانيه بتعيين ابنه سعيد الشوا عام 1906 عمده للمدينه. اشرف الشوا على بناء اول مستشفى في غزه وعده مساجد ومدارس وترميم الجامع الكبير وادخال المحراث الحديث للمدينه.\n\nفي 24 يوليو 1994، اعلنت السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه في غزه وتم تاسيس مجلس المدينه الاول في الاراضي الفلسطينيه. لم تعقد الانتخابات البلديه الفلسطينيه في غزه ولا في رفح او في خان يونس. بدلاً من ذلك، اختارت حركه فتح مسؤولي الحزب في المدن الصغيره والبلدات والقرى لاجراء الانتخابات مع افتراض انهم سيفعلون ما هو افضل في المناطق الاقل حضريه. مع ذلك، فازت حماس المنافسه باغلبيه المقاعد، اذ حصلت على سبعه من بين 10 بلديات تم اختيارها لاول جوله ووصلت نسبه الاقبال على التصويت الى 80% تقريباً. شهد عام 2007 مواجهات عنيفه بين الطرفين خلّفت اكثر من 100 قتيل، مما ادى في نهايه المطاف الى سيطره حماس على المدينه.\nبشكل طبيعي، فان البلديات الفلسطينيه التي يزيد عدد سكانها عن 20,000 نسمه تكون بمثابه مراكز اداريه لها مجالس بلديه، ويتشكل المجلس البلدي الحالي في غزه من 11 عضواً، بينهم رئيس البلديه نزار حجازي.\n\nرؤساء البلديه\nالمدن المتوامه\nالمراجع\nوصلات خارجيه\n\nموقع بلديه غزه\nمتحف شهداء محرقه غزه 2009",

          "content": "Ramallah (UK:  rə-MAL-ə, US:  rə-MAH-lə; Arabic: رام الله, romanized: Rām Allāh; IPA: [raːm alˤ.lˤaːh] ; lit. 'God's Height') is a city in the central West Bank, Palestine. It serves as the administrative capital of Palestine, as well as capital of the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate. The city is situated on the Judaean Mountains, 10 km (6 miles) north of Jerusalem, at an average elevation of 872 meters (2,861 ft) above sea level, adjacent to al-Bireh.\nRamallah has buildings containing masonry from the period of Herod the Great, but no complete building predates the Crusades of the 11th century. The modern city was founded during the 16th century by the Hadadeens, an Arab Christian clan descended from Ghassanids. In 1517, the city was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, and in 1920, it became part of British Mandatory Palestine after it was captured by the United Kingdom during World War I. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Ramallah, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Ramallah was later captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Since the 1995 Oslo Accords, Ramallah has been governed by the Palestinian Authority, as part of Area A in the West Bank.\nRamallah has emerged as a key political, cultural, and economic center in recent years. It houses various Palestinian governmental bodies, including the Mukataa, the official residence of the president of the Palestinian National Authority, the Palestinian Legislative Council, and the headquarters of the Palestinian Security Services. It is also home to several museums and cultural centers, and has a notable nightlife scene. Historically, the city was a predominantly Christian town, however the population of Muslims has increased to constitute a majority of Ramallah's 38,998 residents by 2017, while Christians make up a significant minority.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nRamallah was founded in the 16th century by the Hadadeens, an Arab Christian clan. The city boasts archaeological remnants from earlier epochs. Ancient rock-cut tombs have been found near Ramallah. Located just south of the built-up area is Tell en-Nasbeh, an archeological site where biblical Mizpah in Benjamin is likely to have been located.\nSeveral Ramallah buildings incorporate masonry dating back to the reign of Herod the Great (37–4 BCE). Potsherds from the Crusader/Ayyubid and early Ottoman period have also been found there. Ramallah has been identified with the Crusader place called Ramalie. Remains of a building with an arched doorway from the Crusader era, called al-Burj, have been identified, but the original use of the building is undetermined.\n\nOttoman period\nThe area of Ramallah was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine. Modern Ramallah was founded in the mid-1500s by the Haddadins (also: Haddadeen), a clan of brothers descended from Ghassanid Christians. The Haddadins (ancestors of the present-day Jadallah family, among others), and their leader Rashid el-Haddadin, arrived from east of the Jordan River from the areas of Karak and Shoubak. The Haddadin migration is attributed to fighting and unrest among clans in that area.\nHaddadin was attracted to the mountainous site of Ramallah because it was similar to the mountainous areas he came from. In addition, the heavily forested area could supply him with plenty of fuel for his forges. In 1596, Ramallah was listed in the tax registers as being in the nahiya of Quds (Jerusalem), part of the Liwa of Quds. It had a population of 71 Christian households and 9 Muslim households. It paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, olives, vines or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 9,400 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf.\nIn 1838, American biblical scholar Edward Robinson visited the area, noting that the inhabitants were Christian \"of the Greek rite\". There were 200 taxable men, which gives an estimated total population of 800–900 people. The village \"belonged\" to the Haram al-Sharif, Jerusalem, to which it paid an annual tax of 350 Mids of grain. In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Ramallah as\n\nA large Christian village, of well-built stone houses, standing on a high ridge, with a view on the west extending to the sea. It stands amongst gardens and olive-yards, and has three springs to the south and one on the west; on the north there are three more, within a mile from the village. On the east there is a well. There are rock-cut tombs to the north-east with well-cut entrances, but completely blocked with rubbish. In the village is a Greek church, and on the east a Latin convent and a Protestant schoolhouse, all modern buildings. The village lands are Wakuf, or ecclesiastical property, belonging to the Haram of Jerusalem. About a quarter of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics, the rest Orthodox Greeks.\n\nBritish Mandate\nDuring World War I, the British Army captured and occupied Ramallah in December 1917. The city remained occupied until the designation of the Palestine Mandate in 1920, resulting in Ramallah falling under British Mandatory control until 1948. In the 1920s, the economy of Ramallah started to improve, resulting in the local Arab upper class (consisting primarily of landowners and merchants) ordering the construction of several multi-storied villas, many of which still stand today. In 1939, the Jerusalem Electric Company introduced electricity to Ramallah, and a majority of the city's homes became wired shortly thereafter. On the same year, the British Mandatory authorities inaugurated the state-owned Palestine Broadcasting Service in Ramallah, with BBC members training local radio staff to deliver daily broadcasts in Arabic, Hebrew, and English. The station was later renamed Jerusalem Calling.\nThe city became a center of insurgent activity when the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine broke out. The rebels subsequently established a court near Ramallah, in order to provide legal alternatives to the courts of the British Mandate. One British schoolteacher noted that the Ramallah court judge began to produce \"news sheets on typewriters and duplicators, aimed at publicizing the alternative rebel regime.\"\n\nJordanian and Israeli occupation\nFollowing the creation of the State of Israel and the ensuing conflict, Jordan seized part of the territory, which they named the West Bank, which included Ramallah. Jordan annexed the West Bank, applying its national law to the conquered territory. The West Bank was relatively peaceful during the years of Jordanian occupation between 1948 and 1967, with its residents enjoying freedom of movement between the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. However, many Palestinians were arrested and jailed for being members of \"illegal political parties\", which included the Palestine Communist Party, and other socialist and pro-independence groups. The city's population had doubled by 1953, but the economy and infrastructure could not accommodate the influx of poor villagers. Natives of Ramallah began to emigrate, primarily to the United States. About one fourth of Ramallah's 6,000 natives had left by 1956, with Arabs from the surrounding towns and villages (particularly Hebron) buying the homes and land the émigrés left behind.\n\nDuring the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel captured Ramallah from Jordan, imposing a military closure and conducting a census a few weeks later. Every person registered in the census was given an Israeli identity card which allowed the bearer to continue to reside there. Those who were abroad during the census lost their residency rights. Because of Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, for the first time in 19 years, residents of Ramallah could freely visit the Gaza Strip, as well as Israel, and engage in commerce there.\nUnlike the Jordanians, Israel did not offer citizenship to the residents. Ramallah residents were issued permits to work in Israel, but did not gain the rights associated with Israeli citizenship. The city remained under Israeli military rule for more than four decades. The Israeli Civil Administration (CA), established in 1981, was in charge of civilian and day-to-day services such as issuing permission to travel, build, export or import, and host relatives from abroad. The CA reprinted Jordanian textbooks for distribution in schools but did not update them. The CA was in charge of tax collection and land expropriation, which sometimes included Israeli seizure of olive groves that Arab villagers had tended for generations.\nAccording to the Israeli Human Rights activists, the development of Jewish settlements in the Ramallah area, such as Beit El and Psagot, prevented the expansion of the city and cut it off from the surrounding Arab villages. As resistance increased, Ramallah residents who were members of the Palestine Liberation Organization were jailed or deported to neighboring countries. The popular uprising known as the First Intifada erupted in December 1987, protesting against the continued Israeli occupation.\nRamallah residents were among the early joiners of the First Intifada. The Intifada Unified Leadership, an umbrella organization of various Palestinian factions, distributed weekly bulletins on the streets of Ramallah with a schedule of the daily protests, strikes and action against Israeli patrols in the city. At the demonstrations, tires were burned in the street, and the crowds threw stones and Molotov cocktails. The IDF responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. Schools in Ramallah were forcibly shut down, and opened gradually for a few hours a day. The Israelis conducted house arrests, imposing curfews that restricted travel and exports in what Palestinians regarded as collective punishment. In response to the closure of schools, residents organized home schooling sessions to help students make up missed material; this became one of the few symbols of civil disobedience. Following the Oslo Accords, the Israeli army abandoned the Mukataa in December 1995 and withdrew to the city outskirts. The newly established Palestinian Authority assumed civilian and security responsibility for the city, which was designated \"Area A\" under the accords.\n\nPalestinian Authority control\nThe years between 1993 and 2000 (known locally as the \"Oslo Years\") brought relative prosperity to Ramallah. Ramallah and its immediate environs were classified as Area A in the Oslo Accords, under full civil and security control of the Palestinian Authority (PA) administration in September 1995. Many expatriates returned to establish businesses there, and the atmosphere was one of optimism. In 2000, unemployment began to rise and the economy of Ramallah declined. The Israel Defense Forces remained in control of the territories and its government did not restore the freedom of movement enjoyed by Ramallah residents prior to the first Intifada. Travel to Jerusalem required special permits. The number and size of Israeli settlements around Ramallah increased dramatically. A network of bypass roads for use of Israeli citizens only was built around Ramallah, and Israel expropriated land for settlements. Many official documents previously handled by the Israeli Civil Administration were now handled by the Palestinian Authority but still required Israeli approval. A Palestinian passport issued to Ramallah residents was not valid unless the serial number was registered with the Israeli authorities, who controlled border crossings.The failure of the Camp David summit in July 2000 led to the outbreak of the Second Intifada (al-Aqsa Intifada) in September 2000. Young Ramallah residents demonstrated daily against the Israeli army, with marches to the Israeli checkpoints at the outskirts of the city. Over time, the marches were replaced by sporadic use of live ammunition against Israeli soldiers; and various attacks targeting Jewish settlers, particularly on the Israeli-only bypass roads. Army checkpoints were established to restrict movement in and out of Ramallah. On October 12, 2000, two Israeli army reservists, Vadim Norzhich and Yosef Avrahami were lynched in Ramallah. They had taken a wrong turn, and were set upon by a mob, enraged in particular by the Muhammad al-Durrah incident in Gaza. A frenzied crowd killed the two IDF reservists, mutilated their bodies, and dragged them through the streets. Later that afternoon, the Israeli army carried out an air strike on Ramallah, demolishing the police station. Israel later succeeded in capturing and prosecuting some of those involved in the deaths of the reservists.The IDF has occasionally operated inside Ramallah, in breach of the 1995 Oslo Accords. The first and largest incursion was the 2002 Operation Defensive Shield, with a more recent intervention coming in March 2017 while attempting to arrest a suspected terrorist. In 2002, the army imposed curfews, electricity cuts, school closures and disruptions of commercial life. Many Ramallah institutions, including government ministries, were vandalized, and equipment was destroyed or stolen. The IDF took over local Ramallah television stations, and social and economic conditions deteriorated. Many expatriates left, as did many other Palestinians who complained that the living conditions had become intolerable. Construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier has added to Ramallah's isolation. Yasser Arafat established his West Bank headquarters, the Mukataa, in Ramallah. Although considered an interim solution, Ramallah became the de facto capital of the Palestinian Authority, now officially known as the State of Palestine.  It hosts almost all governmental headquarters.  In December 2001, Arafat held meetings at the Mukataa, but lived with his wife and daughter in Gaza City. After suicide bombings in Haifa, Arafat was confined to the Ramallah compound. In 2002, the compound was partly demolished by the Israeli Defense Forces and Arafat's building was cut off from the rest of the compound.\nOn November 11, 2004, Arafat died at the Percy training hospital of the Armies near Paris. He was buried in the courtyard of the Mukataa on November 12, 2004. The site still serves as the Ramallah headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, as well the official West Bank office of Mahmoud Abbas. Throughout 2005, while the Disengagement Plan was underway, some US government officials suggested to the Palestinian leadership to move the provisional capital back to Gaza, where it had been when the Palestinian Authority was first established in 1994. President Abbas, however, refrained from doing so, arguing that at this point, it was important to keep the administrative center in the West Bank in order to remind the international community that the West Bank was still awaiting a territorial solution.\nIn December 2005, local elections were held in Ramallah in which candidates from three different factions competed for a four-year term on the fifteen-seat municipal council. The council elected Janet Mikhail as mayor, the first woman to hold the post.\nMunir Hamdan, a member of Fatah and a Ramallah businessman, discussed the concentration of government offices with a journalist. He said, \"The president and prime minister have their offices here. So do the parliament and all the government ministries\", representing a \"collusion\" between the Palestinian Authority and Israel to turn Ramallah into the political as well as the financial capital of the Palestinians. He is particularly worried by the construction of a large new governmental complex by the PA. Hatem Abdel Kader, a Jerusalem resident, Fatah legislator and former Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, complained that \"If they are building a new government compound here, that means they have no plans to be based in Jerusalem... Unfortunately, the Palestinian government of Salam Fayyad has abandoned Jerusalem in favor of Ramallah.\" In November 2011, King Abdullah II of Jordan visited Ramallah for the first time since 2000.\n\nGeography and climate\nThis area enjoys a Mediterranean climate of a dry summer and mild, rainy winter with occasional snowfall. The recorded average of Ramallah's rainfall is about 615 mm (24 in) and minimum rainfall is 307 mm (12 in) and maximum rainfall is 1,591 mm (63 in).\nThe Köppen climate classification places Ramallah in the Csa category. Climates of this class generally occur on the western sides of continents between the latitudes of 30° and 45°. These climates are in the polar front region in winter, and thus have moderate temperatures and changeable, rainy weather. Summers are hot and dry, due to the domination of the subtropical high pressure systems, except in the immediate coastal areas, where summers are milder due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents that may bring fog but prevent rain.\n\nEconomy\nRamallah is chief financial and commercial center for the Palestinian Authority, home to the country's numerous financial institutions. Currently Ramallah is seat of power of the Palestinian Authority, whose most of the offices are located within the city. The city serves as the headquarters for most international NGOs and embassies. Hundreds of millions of dollars in aid flowing into the city have boosted Ramallah's economy greatly since the end of the Second Intifada. Ramallah's buoyant economy continues to draw Palestinians from other West Bank towns where jobs are fewer. The built-up area has grown fivefold since 2002.\nConstruction boom is one of the most obvious signs of West Bank economic growth, estimated at an annual rate of 8 percent. This has been attributed to relative stability and Western donor support to the Palestinian Authority. The PIF have begun work on a $400 million commercial center comprising 13 towers which will be some of the tallest in Ramallah. The Ersal Commercial Center has drawn investment from a Saudi Arabian firm, The Land Holding, which has a 10% stake. It is not the only Gulf Arab firm investing in Ramallah and its outskirts. The Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company has a stake in Rawabi, a completely new town being constructed in the hills outside Ramallah at a cost of $1 billion.\nRamallah has highest concentration of high-tech companies. ASAL technologies, an information technology company in Ramallah, has 120 employees and is looking forward to \"exponential growth\". In collaboration with the Republic of India, a new tech park named, the India Palestine Techno Park is located in Birzeit. Apple Inc operates a research & development center in Rawabi with ASAL Technologies. A large number multinational companies operates facilities in Ramallah, which outsource Palestinians.\nBy 2010, Ramallah had become the leading center of economic and political activity in the territories under the control of the Palestinian Authority. During a building boom in the early years of the 21st century, apartment buildings and \"five-star\" hotels were erected, particularly in the Al-Masyoun neighborhood. In 2010, \"more than one hundred\" Palestinian businesses were reported to have moved to Ramallah from East Jerusalem, because \"Here they pay less taxes and have more customers.\" One local boasted to a journalist that \"Ramallah is becoming the de facto capital of Palestine.\" This boast was seconded by The New York Times which, in 2010, called Ramallah the \"de facto capital of the West Bank. According to Sani Meo, the publisher of This Week in Palestine, \"Capital or no capital, Ramallah has done well and Palestine is proud of its achievements.\" Some Palestinians allege that Ramallah's prosperity is part of an Israeli \"conspiracy\" to make Ramallah the capital of a Palestinian state, instead of Jerusalem.\n\nDemographics\nAn Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that Ramallah had 249 houses and a population of 635, though the population count included men only. The village was described as being in the Bire area, \"north of Mikhmas, on a rocky hill.\" In 1896, the population of Ramallah was estimated to be about 2,061 persons.\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Ramallah had a population of 3,104 (2,972 Christians, 125 Muslims, and seven Jews), the Christians consisting of 2,162 Orthodox, 1 Syriac Orthodox (Jacobite), 332 Roman Catholics, 144 Greek Catholic (Melkite Catholic), 211 Church of England, and 122 \"other\". The population increased at the time of the 1931 census to 4,286 (3,766 Christians, 519 Muslims and one Jew) in a total of 1,014 houses. In the 1938 village statistics, the population is listed as 4,900. In the 1945 statistics, the population stood at 5,080, with Christians forming the majority of the population (4,440 Christians and 640 Muslims).\nHowever, the demographic makeup of the town changed drastically under Jordanian occupation, when considerable emigration of Christians took place. This left slightly more than half of the city's 12,134 inhabitants Christian by 1967, and the remainder Muslim.\nRamallah expatriates created one of the largest Arab communities in the United States, settling mainly in Washington, New York, Florida, California, Texas, and especially in Michigan. Many worked in the auto industry. In 1959, the American Federation of Ramallah, Palestine (AFRP) was established in Detroit. The AFRP has several branches in the United States, and holds an annual convention every summer attended by a sizable number of former Ramallah residents and their offspring.\nRamallah's population drastically decreased in the late 20th century from 24,722 inhabitants in 1987 to 17,851 in 1997. In the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) census in 1997, Palestinian refugees accounted for 60.3% of the population, which was 17,851. There were 8,622 males and 9,229 females. People younger than 20 years of age made up 45.9% of the population, while those aged between 20 and 64 were 45.4%, and residents aged over 64 constituted 4.7%.\nOnly in 2005 did the population reach more than 24,000. In a PCBS projection in 2006, Ramallah had a population of 25,467 inhabitants. In the 2007 PCBS census, there were 27,460 people living in the city. Sources vary about the current Christian population in the city, ranging around 25%.\n\nHealth\nIn the aftermath of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt, the Ramallah Hospital Foundation was established and registered as a tax exempt organization in New York in 1944. It bought large pieces of land in the south-eastern fringes of the city dedicated for the future hospital. In 1963, a hospital was opened.\n\nReligion\nThe Jamal Abdel Nasser Mosque is one of the city's largest mosques. The Orthodox Church of Ramallah, an Orthodox Christian convent, Melkite Catholic Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church, Arab Episcopal (Anglican) Church, Ramallah Local Church (Evangelical\\Born Again) and Ramallah Baptist Church all operate schools in the city.\n\nChristian presence\nRamallah grew dramatically throughout the 17th and 18th centuries as an agricultural village, attracting more (predominantly Christian) inhabitants from all around the region. In 1700, Yacoub Elias was the first Ramallah native to be ordained by the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, the Christian denomination that prevailed in the Holy Land at the time. In the early 19th century, the first Jerusalemite Greek Orthodox Christian church was built. Later, in 1852, the Greek Orthodox Church of the Transfiguration, was built to replace it; it is the sole Eastern Orthodox Church in Ramallah today.\nThere is also a Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Ramallah, built in 1895. The Roman Catholic Church also established its presence in Ramallah the 19th century and constitutes today the second-largest Christian denomination in the city. The Roman Catholic Church established the St. Joseph's Girls' School run by St. Joseph sisters, as well as the co-educational Al-Ahliyyah College high school run by Rosary sisters. In 1913, construction of the Catholic Holy Family Church was started.\nAs of 2022, Ramallah also has a Coptic Orthodox Church, an Evangelical Lutheran Church and an Episcopalian (Anglican) Church. In the 19th century, the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) established a presence in Ramallah and built the Ramallah Friends Schools, one for girls and later a boys' school, to alleviate the dearth of education for women and girls. Eli and Sybil Jones opened \"The Girls Training Home of Ramallah\" in 1869. A medical clinic was established in 1883, with Dr. George Hassenauer serving as the first doctor in Ramallah. In 1889, the girls academy became the Friends Girls School (FGS). As the FGS was also a boarding school, it attracted a number of girls from surrounding communities, including Jerusalem, Lydda, Jaffa, and Beirut. The Friends Boys School (FBS) was founded in 1901 and opened in 1918. The Quakers opened a Friends Meeting House for worship in the city center in 1910. According to the school's official website, most high school students choose to take the International Baccalaureate exams (IBE) instead of the traditional \"Tawjihi\" university exams.\nThe activity of foreign churches in Palestine in the late 19th century increased awareness of prosperity in the West. In Ramallah and Bethlehem, a few miles south, local residents began to seek economic opportunity overseas. In 1901, merchants from Ramallah emigrated to the United States and established import-export businesses, selling handmade rugs and other exotic wares across the Atlantic. Increased trade dramatically improved living standards for Ramallah's inhabitants. American cars, mechanized farming equipment, radios, and later televisions became attainable luxuries for upper-class families. As residents of Jaffa and Lydda moved to Ramallah, the balance of Muslims and Christians began to change.\nIn the 21st century, a large community of people with direct descent from the Haddadins who founded Ramallah live in the United States. The town is now predominately Muslim, but still contains a Christian minority. The change in demographics is due mostly to new migration of Muslims to the area, and emigration of Christians from the area.\n\nCulture\nRamallah is generally considered the most affluent and cultural, as well as the most liberal, of all Palestinian cities, and is home to a number of popular Palestinian activists, poets, artists, and musicians.\nIn 2004 the Ramallah Cultural Palace opened in the city. The only cultural center of its kind in the Palestinian-governed areas, it houses a 736-seat auditorium, as well as conference rooms, exhibit halls, and movie-screening rooms. It was a joint venture of the Palestinian Authority, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Japanese government. Ramallah hosted its first annual international film festival in 2004.\n\nPalestinian costume\nUntil the 1940s, traditional Palestinian costumes reflected a woman's economic and marital status and her town or district of origin, with knowledgeable observers discerning this information from the fabric, colours, cut, and embroidery motifs (or lack thereof) used in the apparel.\nVillages in the Levant under Ottoman rule remained isolated due to the difficulty of travel in the 19th century. As a result, clothing and accessories became a statement of region. In Ramallah, the back panels of dresses often incorporated a palm tree motif embroidered in cross-stitch.\n\nInternational relations\nMany foreign nations have located their diplomatic missions to the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah, including, as of 2010, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Korea, South Africa, Norway, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, China, Poland, Portugal, The Netherlands, Russia, Jordan, Brazil, Finland, Denmark, Ireland, Germany, India, Japan, the Czech Republic, Canada and Mexico.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nRamallah is twinned with:\n\nNotable people\nPaul Ajlouny (b. 1933), Palestinian-American publisher and businessman\nHamze Awawde (b. 1990), Palestinian peace activist\nMahmoud Eid (b. 1993), professional footballer\nAmber Fares, Lebanese Canadian filmmaker\nYasmeen Mjalli (born 1996), American and Palestinian fashion designer, photographer and anti-street harassment activist.\nJibril Rajoub (b. 1953), Palestinian political leader, former militant\nMosab Hassan Yousef (b. 1978), Palestinian ex-militant and defector\n\nSee also\nPalestinian Christians\nEconomy of the State of Palestine\nAl-Ram, Palestinian town few km southeast of Ramallah\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nRamallah City Archived October 16, 2012, at the Wayback Machine\nWelcome To The City of Ramallah\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 17:  IAA, Wikimedia commons\nRamallah History\nMusic and Art from Ramallah Archived January 21, 2009, at the Wayback Machine\nQuaker Meeting in Ramallah\nWest Bank/Palestine\nRamallah\nAl Kasaba Theatre\nKhalil Sakakini Cultural Centre\nFirst Ramallah Group\nRamallah International Film Festival Archived June 17, 2013, at the Wayback Machine\nRamallahOnline.com\nRamallah Club of Metro Detroit\nJnewswire.com, Ramallah ancient synagogue\nAnne Brunswic's book Welcome to Palestine, English translation",
          "summary": "Ramallah (UK:  rə-MAL-ə, US:  rə-MAH-lə; Arabic: رام الله, romanized: Rām Allāh; IPA: [raːm alˤ.lˤaːh] ; lit. 'God's Height') is a city in the central West Bank, Palestine. It serves as the administrative capital of Palestine, as well as capital of the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate. The city is situated on the Judaean Mountains, 10 km (6 miles) north of Jerusalem, at an average elevation of 872 meters (2,861 ft) above sea level, adjacent to al-Bireh.\nRamallah has buildings containing masonry from the period of Herod the Great, but no complete building predates the Crusades of the 11th century. The modern city was founded during the 16th century by the Hadadeens, an Arab Christian clan descended from Ghassanids. In 1517, the city was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, and in 1920, it became part of British Mandatory Palestine after it was captured by the United Kingdom during World War I. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Ramallah, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Ramallah was later captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Since the 1995 Oslo Accords, Ramallah has been governed by the Palestinian Authority, as part of Area A in the West Bank.\nRamallah has emerged as a key political, cultural, and economic center in recent years. It houses various Palestinian governmental bodies, including the Mukataa, the official residence of the president of the Palestinian National Authority, the Palestinian Legislative Council, and the headquarters of the Palestinian Security Services. It is also home to several museums and cultural centers, and has a notable nightlife scene. Historically, the city was a predominantly Christian town, however the population of Muslims has increased to constitute a majority of Ramallah's 38,998 residents by 2017, while Christians make up a significant minority.",

          "content": "رام الله مدينه فلسطينيه، ومركز محافظه رام الله والبيره. تقع في الضفه الغربيه الى الشمال من القدس بحوالي 15 كم، وترتفع عن سطح البحر 880 مترًا، وتبلغ مساحتها 16,5 كم²، بلغ عدد سكانها حوالي 38,998 نسمه، بينما يبلغ عدد سكان المحافظه حوالي 328,861 نسمه. تلاصق رام الله مدينه البيره حتى تتداخل مبانيهما وشوارعهما لتبدوا كمدينه واحده، ومع ان مدينه البيره اكبر من حيث المساحه وعدد السكان، الّا ان الاشهر بينهما هي مدينه رام الله.\n\nتحتل رام الله حاليًا مركزًا سياسيًا يجعلها من اهم المدن الفلسطينيه، اذ انها تُعتبر العاصمه الاداريه المؤقته للسلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه، وفيها الى جانب مدينه البيره مقر الرئاسه الفلسطينيه، ومبنى المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني، والمقرات العامه للاجهزه الامنيه الفلسطينيه في الضفه الغربيه، بالاضافه الى معظم مكاتب ووزارات السلطه. كما تعتبر العاصمه الثقافيه لوجود عدد من المراكز الثقافيه الفلسطينيه النشطه فيها.\nعُرفت المدينه بعدد من الاسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسم المدينه في مصادر واثار الصليبيين، ووفقًا لعلماء الاثار فان المدينه قد تاسست في القرن السادس عشر اثناء الحكم العثماني، والتي ازدهرت في اواخر ايامهم اذ تاسس اول مجلس بلدي فيها عام 1908. وقد احتفلت بلديه رام الله مؤخرا بمئويتها الاولى مطلقه مشروعًا تنمويًا بهذه المناسبه.\nتقع رام الله ضمن سلسله جبال القدس، حيث تطل على الساحل الفلسطيني للبحر المتوسط، والذي يبعد عن المدينه حوالي 45 كيلومترا الى الغرب. اما من جهه الشرق والجنوب فهي محاطه بالجبال، وترتفع عن سطح البحر بين 770 مترًا. وتعتبر المدينه تاريخيًا منطقه مسيحيه، الا ان معظم سكانها اليوم هم من المسلمين، مع وجود قوي لاقليه مسيحيه.\n\nالتسميه\nتضاربت الاقوال عن تسميه رام الله اذ عرفت في التوراه باسم (رامَتايم صوفيم) وذكرها المؤرخ يوسيفوس باسم (فكولا)، وقيل (جلبات ايلوهم). وقد اثبت الاثريون عدم صحه هذه الاسماء لان امكنه الملوك التي نسبت اليهم مثل الملك صموئيل وشاؤول مختلفه عن المدينه الحاليه.\nالا ان هناك تفسيرات اقرب الى الصحه اذ تعني كلمه رام المنطقه المرتفعه، وهي كلمه كنعانيه منتشره في اماكن مختلفه في فلسطين، واضاف اليها العرب كلمه الله فاصبحت رام الله، وقد عرفها الصليبيون بهذا الاسم، ولكن الثابت تاريخيا ان قبيله عربيه جاءت في اواخر القرن السادس عشر وسكنت في قريه او غابه حرجيه اسمها رام الله.\n\nالتاريخ\nنظرا لان رام الله والبيره تمتدان عمرانيا بشكل متصل، اذ لا يمكن فصل تاريخ المدينتين عن بعضها الاخر، فمن الطبيعي ان يتم دراسه تاريخهما بشكل متكامل. وتشير الدراسات التاريخيه والاثريه الى ان قصه النبي يوسف قد حدثت في منطقه رام الله والبيره، ولقد اختلف المؤرخون في تحديد البئر الذي القي فيه النبي يوسف، وعلى الرغم من هذا الاختلاف فان موقع البيره الحالي لا يبتعد كثيرا عن هذه التوقعات بسبب وقوعه على طريق القوافل المتجهه من الجنوب الى الشمال او بالعكس، وكان هذا الموقع الذي كانت تحط به الرحال طلباً للراحه والاستجمام وسعياً وراء الطعام والماء، وكان يوجد في البيره نبع ماء قديم كان معروفا لتلك القوافل، ما حفز الاهالي في ذلك الوقت الى اقامه اكثر من بناء لتزويد المسافرين بحاجاتهم من الطعام لقاء مال او مبادله تجاريه، وقد ذكر الانجيل ان السيد المسيح كان يمر بالبيره في طريقه من القدس الى الناصره (تخلف مع فتيان البيره الذين كانوا يلهون ويلعبون على نبع الماء وهكذا ضل عن امه وعن يوسف النجار، مما اضطرها الى العوده الى القدس لكي تبحث عنه).\nعند الفتح الاسلامي لبلاد الشام في القرن السابع الميلادي دخلت البيره في حوزه المسلمين، وبنى المسلمون في الفتره الاسلاميه المبكره مسجدين بالقرب من الخان ما زالا مستخدمين حتى اليوم، يعرف الاول منهما باسم «الجامع العمري»، وهو الجامع الملاصق لكنيسه العائله المقدسه وسط البلده القديمه، «وجامع العين» الواقع على عين شارع القدس- نابلس بالقرب من مبنى البلديه الحالي. وتغير مركز مدينه البيره من عصر الى اخر، ويبدو ان اقدم موقع استوطنه اهل البيره هو منطقه الارسال، ثم تل النصبه، ثم عين ام الشرايط، ثم موقع البلده القديمه الحالي، اما الان فقد توسعت حدود المدينه فشملت كل هذه المناطق. وفي سنه 1099 وقعت في ايدي الغزاه الفرنجه قبل احتلالهم لمدينه القدس، واقاموا فيها فتره من الزمن وكانت مركزاً ممتازاً. في عام 1187 عبر جنود المسلمين بقياده صلاح الدين البيره ومن ثم استطاع صلاح الدين انتزاع القدس من ايدي الصليبين.\nكانت رام الله في فتره الحروب الصليبيه مستعمره زراعيه الى جوار البيره، اطلق الصليبيون عليها اسم \"Ramallie\" او \"Ramalie\" حيث توجد بقايا برج صليبي في البلده القديمه لرام الله، ويقال ان رام الله وبعض البلدان الاخرى قد اوقف الملك قلاوون عُشر منتوجات اراضيها على حرم الخليل. الا انها لم تكن معروفه حتى القرن السادس عشر بسبب صغر مساحتها وقله عدد سكانها بالمقارنه بالقرى المحيطه بها.\n\nالدوله العثمانيه\nاسست مدينه رام الله على يد شيخ احدى عشائر الكرك المسيحيه يدعى الشيخ راشد الحدادين، قرر الجلو عن موطنه بسبب خلافات عشائريه في القرن السادس عشر. ويحكى انه جلى من الكرك ليلا وبعد ايام دخل على اهل البيره فرحبوا به. واشاروا عليه بخربه اسمها رام الله لتكون موطنه. اشترى الشيخ راشد خربه رام الله من عائلات البيره القدامى، دون ان يعلم انه كان يؤسس لمدينه سيكون لها دور هام في تاريخ الفلسطينيين.\nوتجسد تماثيل الاسود الخمسه الواقعه في ساحه المناره وسط مدينه رام الله تاريخ المدينه، حيث قام النحات ابو صادق غانم بنحتها لترمز لابناء راشد الحدادين الخمسه، عواد، ويوسف، وجغب، وشقره، وشراقه، والذين انبثقت منهم عائلات رام الله.\nوقد بدا في رام الله مع نهايه القرن التاسع عشر تاسيس مدارس كانت من اولى المدارس النظاميه في فلسطين، اسمها «الفرندز» وتعني (الاصدقاء)، وهي من المدارس التبشيريه التي بادرت الى ايجادها جماعه الكويكرز وهي منظمه دينيه مسيحيه اميركيه. وتضم مدرستين في رام الله والبيره، الاولى للبنات وتعود للعام 1889 والاخرى للصبيان تعود للعام 1901. وكلتاهما تتبعان لمجلس امناء واحد ويزيد عدد طلابهما الان عن الالف.\n\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عام 1917، سقطت رام الله بيد الجيش الانجليزي، ودخلت المدينه مع باقي مدن فلسطين مظله الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين عام 1920، واصبحت رام الله مركزا لقضاء رام الله في تلك الفتره حتى وقوع النكبه. كانت المدنيه قد ازدادت اهميه في هذه الفتره نتيجه ثلاثه تطورات مهمه: اولها انشاء اعمده الارسال الشاهقه لـ «محطه الاذاعه الفلسطينيه» من قبل حكومه الانتداب البريطانيه عام 1936 على اراضي قريه البيره التي يقع مدخلها على الشارع الرئيسي المتجه الى قريه بيرزيت وقرى بني زيد. وهو الشارع الذي اصبح اسمه منذ ذلك الحين «شارع الاذاعه» او «شارع الارسال». وللشارع اهميه كبيره في ذلك الوقت نظرا لوجود عدد من الفنادق «كفندق الحمراء» و«فندق حرب» وكان يجذب اهالي مدينه رام الله والقدس ايام الاحاد للاستمتاع بالجلوس في احضان الطبيعه.\nاما التطور الثاني فقد جاء نتيجه الثوره الفلسطينيه الكبرى 1936-1939، حيث اقامت حكومه الانتداب على غرار ما جرى في بقيه المدن الفلسطينيه، المبنى الضخم المعروف حاليا بمبنى المقاطعه (مبنى تجاري على اسم المهندس البريطاني الذي صمم هذه المباني لتستوعب الدوائر الحكوميه والسجون ...الخ). وبالتالي فقد اصبحت معنيه بتوسيع شبكه الطرق القريبه لتستوعب الضغط الناجم عن انشاء هذا المبنى ومحطه الاذاعه. اما التطور الثالث فكان له علاقه بالهجره الى الاميركيتين من قبل سكان رام الله والبيره وتعاظم ثروه اهل المدينتين مما ادى الى توسع عمراني كبير على امتداد الشوارع الجديده وخارج اطار المسطحات القديمه والمتراصه نسبيا.\nوقد ادت هذه التطورات الى توسيع شبكه الطرق في المدينتين، وخصوصا توسيع وتعبيد طريق الاذاعه وانجاز خريطه التنظيم الهيكليه لرام الله عام 1940. وهكذا اخذت شبكه الطرق المتفرعه عن الميدان شكلها النهائي رغم ان المنطقه المحيطه بالميدان ظلت في معظمها خاليه اساسا من العمران. اذ لم تجر خلال الحرب العالميه الثانيه تطورات عمرانيه تذكر فظروف الحرب قد حالت دون الحصول على مواد البناء وخصوصا الاسمنت والحديد حيث احتفظت بهما حكومه الانتداب للاغراض الحربيه.\nقرار التقسيم\n\nقامت هيئه الامم المتحده عام 1947 بمحاوله لايجاد حل للنزاع العربي/اليهودي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئه الامم بتشكيل لجنه UNSCOP المتالّفه من دول متعدّده باستثناء الدّول دائمه العضويه لضمان الحياد في عمليه ايجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنه بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الاول باقامه دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينه القدس من قِبل اداره دوليه. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تاسيس فيدراليه تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهوديه والعربيه. ومال معظم افراد لجنه UNSCOP تجاه المشروع الاول والرامي لتاسيس دولتين مستقلّتين باطار اقتصدي موحد. وقامت هيئه الامم بقبول مشروع لجنه UNSCOP الدّاعي للتقسيم مع اجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركه بين الدولتين، العربيه واليهوديه، على ان يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nاعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من ارض فلسطين للدوله اليهوديه، وشملت حصّه اليهود من ارض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من اسدود الى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينه يافا) واغلبيه مساحه صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينه بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصريه). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحه للزراعه ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الارض الفلسطينيه على اماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهوديه بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدوله اليهوديه. وكانت رام الله في ذلك الوقت مركزا لقضاء رام الله، التي تم الحاقها بالدوله العربيه المُقترحه.\n\nالاداره الاردنيه\nوفي اوائل خمسينيات القرن العشرين خضعت رام الله للحكم الاردني بين حربي 1948 و1967، واصبحت رام الله فيما بعد مركزا للواء رام الله التابع لمحافظه القدس. وقد كانت المدينه هادئه نسبيا خلال سنوات الحكم الاردني، وكان السكان يتمتعون بحريه الحركه بين الضفه الغربيه والاردن ولبنان وسوريا واماكن اخرى. وكان الاردن بضم الضفه الغربيه، يطبق قانونه على الارض. ومع ذلك، سجن كثير من الفلسطينيين لكونهم اعضاء في ما كانت الحكومه الاردنيه تعتبره احزاب سياسيه غير مشروعه، بما في ذلك الحزب الشيوعي الفلسطيني وغيرها من الجماعات الاشتراكيه والمؤيده للاستقلال. وضع القانون الاردني قيودا على الابداع والحريه المطلوبه من قبل العديد من الفلسطينيين في ذلك الوقت. بحلول عام 1953، تضاعف سكان رام الله، ولكنها لم تكن مجهزه للاقتصاد والبنيه التحتيه للتعامل مع تدفق القرويين الفقراء. غادر اهالي مدينه رام الله، في المقام الاول الى الولايات المتحده. ونظراً لكون مدينه رام الله مركز للواء فقد استاثرت بنصيب وافر من مراكز الخدمات الاداريه والتعليميه والصحيه والاجتماعيه والاقتصاديه يشرف عليها المجلس البلدي والذي قام بتاسيس شركه المياه، وغرفه التجاره تاسست عام 1950م وغايتها تسهيل الاعمال التجاريه.\n\nحرب 1967\nسقطت المدينه في يد اسرائيل بعد عام 1967، لتظل تحت الاحتلال لمده 27 سنه وتعاني من الاهمال الاسرائيلي لها كباقي المدن العربيه الفلسطينيه المحتله. وقد صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات شائعه من اراضي رام الله وقراها واقامت عليها العديد من المستوطنات، وقد بلغ عدد المستوطنات حتى نهايه عام 1987م حوالي 30 مستوطنه، واكبر هذه المستوطنات مستوطنه (ريمونيم) وهي قريه تعاونيه انشات عام 1980م.\nفي عام 1987، انخرط سكان مدينه رام الله بوقت مبكر في الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الاولى. وكانت القياده الوطنيه الموحده للانتفاضه، تقوم بتوزيع النشرات الاسبوعيه في شوارع رام الله مع جدول زمني للاضراب المتصاحب مع الاحتجاجات اليوميه ضد الدوريات الاسرائيليه في المدينه. وفي المظاهرات، تم احراق الاطارات في الشوارع، كما القى الحشود الحجاره والزجاجات الحارقه على جنود الاحتلال. ورد الجيش الاسرائيلي بالغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي. واغلقت المدارس في مدينه رام الله قسرا، وفتحت تدريجيا لبضع ساعات. ونفذت الاعتقالات خارج البيوت، وفرض حظر التجول ومنع السفر، ما اعتبره الفلسطينيون بانه عقاب جماعي. ردا على اغلاق المدارس، وتنظيم دورات تعليم سكان المنزل لمساعده الطلاب على استدراك الماده الفائته، وهذا اصبح واحدا من الرموز القليله من العصيان المدني.\nفي عام 1991، ضم الوفد الفلسطيني الى مؤتمر مدريد للسلام الدولي العديد من وجهاء رام الله. كما خفت حده الانتفاضه قدما، واستانفت الحياه الطبيعيه في رام الله. في ديسمبر 1995، وذلك تامشيا مع اتفاق اوسلو، تخلى الجيش الاسرائيلي عن المقاطعه وانسحب الى ضواحي المدينه. تولت السلطه الفلسطينيه التي انشئت حديثا المدنيه والمسؤوليه الامنيه للمدينه، والتي اعتبرت «المنطقه ا» الخاضعه للاتفاقات.\n\nالسلطه الفلسطينيه\nفي 1994 تم نقل الحكم فيها للسلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه بموجب اتفاق اوسلو الموقع عام 1993، التي اُعلن بموجبه عن مناطق المدينه (دون القرى التابعه لها او امتداداتها) انها منطقه الف (ا)؛ وهذه الارض تخضع لسيطره شبه كامله من السلطه الفلسطينيه. اصبحت رام الله المقر المؤقت للسلطه الفلسطينيه، وبسبب رفض اسرائيل ان يكون مقر السلطه الفلسطينيه في القدس الشرقيه. وقد شهدت المدينه نهضه حضاريه ومعماريه كبيره في هذه الفتره.\nتعرّض كثير من تلك المقرات في رام الله الى دمار كبير الحقته اله الحرب الاسرائيليه كجزء من الهجمات المستمره على المدينه في فتره الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه، مما ادّى الى تعطيلها الى حدِّ كبير، وعادت هذه المقرات للعمل في الفتره اللاحقه للاجتياح الاسرائيلي الكبير للمدينه في عام 2002 جاعله رام الله العاصمه الاداريه (كامر واقع) لسلطه الحكم الذاتي الفلسطينيه. يشار بالذكر الى ان حكومه نتنياهو شرعت في اعداد دراسه تهدف الى اقناع الفلسطينيين باهميه مدينه رام الله كعاصمه بديله من القدس الشرقيه. وتركز الدراسه على التذكير بمواقف اسحق رابين الذي ثبت مدينه القدس بقسميها الغربي والشرقي، عاصمه ابديه موحده لدوله اليهود، ومع انه وافق على فصل الشان السياسي عن الشان الديني، ووعد المسلمين والمسيحيين بممارسه شعائرهم في ظل القانون الاسرائيلي، الا انه اخضع وعده لضرورات الامن القومي. لهذا السبب لم يسمح لياسر عرفات بزياره القدس خوفاً من الجماهير التي ستستقبله.\n\nالجغرافيا\nرام الله مدينه جبليه، مبنيه على جبال مطله الى الغرب على الساحل الفلسطيني، اما من جهه الشرق والجنوب فهي محاطه بالجبال. تبعد رام الله حوالي عشره 15 كم الى الشمال من القدس وتبعد المدينه عن البحر المتوسط الذي يرى من تلالها حوالي 45 كيلومترا هوائيا وكثيرا ما تشاهد منها اثناء النهار السفن الراسيه، كما تبعد عن نهر الاردن قرابه 33 كم الى الغرب. ونظرا لقرب البحر منها فان الهواء الذي يهب عليها من الغرب يحمل معه بعض الرطوبه ولكن ارتفاع البلده عن سطح البحر الذي يتراوح بين 830-880 مترا يلطف من هذه الرطوبه. وتبلغ مساحه مدينه رام الله 19 الف دونم، واتخذت مجالس بلديه سابقه قرارا بتوسيع حدود المدينه الى الفي دونم اخرى.\nويتوسط موقع رام الله فلسطين التاريخيه تقريبا، حيث تبعد عن نابلس 36 كم الى الجنوب، وجنين 63 كم الى الجنوب، والخليل 82 كم الى الشمال، وغزه 82 كم الى الشمال الشرقي، ويافا 45 كم الى الشرق، وحيفا 105 كم الى الجنوب الشرقي.\n\nمناطق المدينه\nتُقسم المدينه الى 19 حيًا وهي: الريحان، الدبلوماسي، الكرينعه، الواد، النرجس، الطيره، المصايف، الاذاعه، ردانا، عين مصباح، الجدول، قدوره، القديره، الماصيون، عين منجد، باطن الهواء، مركز المدينه، البلده القديمه والمنطقه الصناعيه. اما بالنسبه للطرق، فتقطع رام الله عده طرق تربط مناطقها ببعض، كما تربطها بالمدن الملتصقه بها كـالبيره وبيتونيا، وباقي قرى ومدن فلسطين المجاوره كالقدس وبيت لحم ونابلس، والتي قامت بلديه رام الله بتسميتها على اسماء لمناطق وشخصيات فلسطينيه او عالميه، ومن اهم هذه الطرق:\n\nالمناخ\nمناخ رام الله هو مناخ متوسطي ففي الشتاء تتعرض البلده للرياح الجنوبيه الغربيه القاسيه الماطره واحيانا الى رياح شماليه شرقيه جافه بارده نسبيا. اما معدل سقوط الامطار هو حوالي 20 انشا او 500 مليمتر في السنه. وعلى العموم فان معدل درجه الحراره في الشتاء نادرا ما يصل الى 32 فهرنهايت او صفر مئوي وفي الصيف قلما تزيد على 95 ف او 35 درجه مئويه ويمكننا القول بان معدل درجه الحراره السنوي يتراوح بين 41-77 ف او 5-25 م.\nوفي اوائل نيسان تاخذ الرياح الخماسينيه بالهبوب وهذه رياح جافه تحمل معها كثيرا من الغبار وهي تاتينا من الجنوب وينقطع هبوب الرياح الخماسينيه كلما اقترب فصل الصيف وتهب ايضا على البلده رياح دافئه في اواخر الصيف واوائل الخريف وتعجل بانهاء موسمي العنب والتين. وعلى العموم فان مناخ رام الله لطيف منعش في الصيف دافئ في الشتاء وهذا جعل الحياه فيها حياه نشاط وعمل.\n\nالسكان\nالجدول الاتي يبين عدد سكان المدينه في فترات مختلفه:\n\nيبلغ عدد سكان رام الله اليوم قرابه 30 الف نسمه. وبالرغم من ان رام الله كانت مدينه صغيره، الا ان اللاجئين الفلسطينيين بعد النكبه عام 1948 شكلوا جزءا رئيسيا من التوزيع السكاني الجديد، كما ان الهجره الداخليه وانتقال فلسطينيين للعمل في رام الله بعد قدوم سلطه الحكم الذاتي الفلسطينيه جراء تحولها الى مركز اداري للسلطه زاد من عدد السكان المستقرين القادمين من مدن اخرى.\nوقد بلغ عدد سكان رام الله عام 1922م حوالي 3067 نسمه، وفي عام 1945م 5080 نسمه، وفي عام 1967م بلغ عدد سكانها حسب الاحصاء الاسرائيلي 12134 نسمه، ارتفع هذا العدد ليصل عام 1987م حوالي 24772 نسمه.\nتتمتع رام الله عن باقي المدن الفلسطينيه باستمراريه وتعدديه بالنشاطات الثقافيه بين المهرجانات والندوات والمؤتمرات والمعارض، ويعود ذلك الى عده اسباب، احدها تمركز عدد كبير من المؤسسات الناشطه في هذا المجال في مدينه رام الله اضافه الى نشاط بلديه رام الله في هذا المجال ووجود وزاره الثقافه التابعه لسلطه الحكم الذاتي الفلسطيني في المدينه. وكذلك تنوع النسيج الثقافي الاجتماعي في المدينه واتساع هامش الحريه مما جذب العديد من الشخصيات الثقافيه الى مدينه رام الله من مخرجين وكتّاب وشعراء.\nمن المؤسسات العامله في مجال الثقافه في المدينه مركز الفن الشعبي ومعهد ادوارد سعيد للموسيقى ومسرح وسينماتك القصبه ومؤسسه سريه رام الله الاولى والقصر الثقافي التابع لبلديه المدينه ومركز بلدنا الثقافي ورواق وشاشات ومسرح عشتار ومركز خليل السكاكيني الثقافي ومؤسسه الكمنجاتي وجالاري المحطه ومؤسسه تامر ومنتدى الفنانين الصغار والمركز الثقافي البريطاني ومؤسسه عبد المحسن القطان ومتحف محمود درويش والمركز الثقافي اليوناني والمؤسسه الفلسطينيه للفن المعاصر والمركز الثقافي الفرنسي الالماني.\n\nالاقتصاد\nتعكس رام الله صوره مدينه مزدهره تشهد حركه اعمال محمومه وفوره عقاريه كست تلالها بالمباني، غير ان هذه المدينه التي تحتضن مقر السلطه الفلسطينيه في الضفه الغربيه تبقى استثناء في مشهد اقتصادي عام هش.\nولقد مارس سكان مدينه رام الله والبيره العديد من الحرف منذ القدم، منها الزراعه وتربيه المواشي حيث زرعوا العنب والتين والزيتون، واشتغل السكان في التجاره حيث تنقل التجار بين المدن والقرى المجاوره، كما اشتغل السكان في الصناعه مثل صناعه الاحذيه والملابس والمواد الغذائيه والفخار واستمر الحال حتى اوائل القرن العشرين، حيث اتجه السكان الى الهجره الى امريكا خصوصا الشباب منهم، فاخذت الاموال تتدفق على المدينه ليستثمرها السكان في شراء الاراضي وبناء العقارات لاستغلالها في السياحه، وازدادت حركه التعليم وما ان انتهت الحرب العالميه الثانيه حتى وقعت حرب 1948 فكان معظم سكان المدينه قد هاجروا الى امريكا باستثناء 12% منهم بقوا في المدينه.\nتوجد حاليا العديد من الصناعات مثل صناعه الورق الصحي والكرتون والاثاث والمواد الغذائيه وعصر الزيتون والصابون والالمنيوم والادويه والكثير من الحرف اليدويه والتقليديه.\nاما بالنسبه للزراعه فقد اضمحلت بسبب هجره السكان للاراضي الزراعيه وتحويلها بنايات لتاخذ مكان البيوت القديمه واصبحت المدينه تعج بمئات المحال التجاريه الممتده.\nومن الملاحظ ان تكلفه المعيشه في مدينه رام الله هي اعلى مستوى من نظيراتها في المحافظات الاخرى، ويمكن ارجاع السبب الى عده عوامل، اهمها وجود شريحه واسعه في رام الله يفوق مستوى دخلها معدل الدخل لباقي سكان رام الله وباقي سكان المحافظات الاخرى نظرا لعمل هذه الشريحه مع المؤسسات الاجنبيه والدوليه ما يجعلها قادره على تحمّل هذه النفقات، وثانياً وجود عدد كبير من الاجانب العاملين في رام الله ذوي الدخل المرتفع جداً بالمقارنه مع المواطن العادي مما تسبب في زياده الاسعار على كافه المستويات وبالذات العقار والمنافع الخدماتيه كالمطاعم والقاعات، بالاضافه الى وجود تحويلات شبه دائمه من المغتربين من سكان قراها الشرقيه والتي معظم افرادها مغتربون في الولايات المتحده الامريكيه، وهنالك امثله صارخه للقرى الشرقيه للمدينه التي حققت اعلى النسب في اغتراب افرادها الى الولايات المتحده الامريكيه. ويمكن اليوم ان يُقارن مستوى المعيشه في المدينه بنظيره في مدن عالميه اخرى. يشار الى انه يُقام كل عام معرضٌ للصناعات الفلسطينيه في مدينه رام الله.\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nيمكن السفر الى المدن المجاوره لرام الله بواسطه سياره اجره او حافلات صغيره. سيارات الاجره متوفره دائما في جميع انحاء مدينه رام الله، كذلك بالنسبه للحافلات او الحافلات الصغيره. ويتنقل المواطنون الفلسطينيون بين رام الله والمدن والقرى المجاوره - منذ انتفاضه الاقصى - بصعوبه بالغه، حيث يعاني المواطن وفي كثيراً من الاحيان الامرّين حتى يصل الى مبتغاه في الوقت المحدد وربما لا يصله اطلاقاً، مرد ذلك الاجراءات الاسرائيليه من حواجز واغلاقات.\nيقع جنوب رام الله في بلده قلنديا، مطار القدس الدولي او كما تشيع تسميته «مطار قلنديا»، يقع على اراضي محافظه القدس تحديداً في بلده قلنديا على طريق (القدس - رام الله). يعتبر المطار اقرب الى رام الله منه الى مدينه القدس.\nانشيء المطار عام 1920 تحت اداره الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين ثم في اوائل الخمسينيات وضع تحت الاداره الاردنيه بعد انضمام الضفه الغربيه الى المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه، الا انه وقع بيد القوات الاسرائيليه في حرب 1967، والتي سرعان ما غيرت اسمه الى «مطار عطاروت». ومنذ انتفاضه الاقصى والمطار مهمل بالرغم من انه تحت سيطره الجيش الاسرائيلي. شهد المطار حركه سياحيه وتجاريه نشطه في الخمسينيات والستينيات، وقد استخدمه الكثير من المسافرين واصحاب الشخصيات الهامه مثل بابا الفاتيكان على سبيل المثال لا الحصر، وذلك لاهميه القدس الدينيه والسياحيه.\n\nالاتصالات\nتقع في رام الله مقرات شركات الاتصال الفلسطينيه التي تزود الضفه الغربيه بهذه الخدمه (جوال والوطنيه موبايل). تاسست مجموعه الاتصالات الفلسطينيه عام 1995 في رام الله، وكانت اول شركه اتصالات مملوكه للقطاع الخاص في العالم العربي وباشرت اعمالها في يناير عام 1997 كمشغل ومقدم لكافه انواع خدمات الاتصالات في فلسطين. تتكون المجموعه اليوم من شركه الاتصالات الفلسطينيه، وشركه جوال المزود الفلسطيني الاول لخدمه الاتصال الخلوي في فلسطين وشركه «حضاره» لخدمات الاتصالات وتكنولوجيا المعلومات بالاضافه الى شركه «حلول» لتكنولوجيه المعلومات وشركه «بال ميديا» لتقديم الخدمات المرئيه والاعلاميه المميزه. بالاضافه الى هذه الشركات تقوم شركه الوطنيه موبايل بتزويد خدمات الاتصالات الخليويه ايضا، والتي اطلقت خدماتها تجارياً في 2009.\n\nالعماره والتخطيط الحضري\nتمتاز مدينه رام الله بغناها المعماري وتطورها الاجتماعي والذي انعكس عبر مبانيها وحاراتها وتجمع ساكنيها، حيث يشعر الزائر بمتابعه بصريه جميله تعطيه الاحساس والشعور بكينونته كانسان بمقاييسها الانسانيه والاحساس بالزمن ببعديه الماضي والمستقبلي للواجهات والاسقف والخانات والازقه. وتعتبر المدينه اكبر تجمع من حيث عدد المباني القديمه في محافظه رام الله، بحيث تحتوي على 381 مبنى قديماً، وتشكل ما نسبته 5 % من عدد المباني الكلي في المحافظه، وتليها بذلك رنتيس، حيث تحتوي على 326 مبنى، ثم نعلين بـ 292 مبنى، ومن ثم عابود بـ 281 مبنى قديماً.\nوقد تاسس في بدايه تسعينيات القرن الفائت، مركز معني بالحفاظ على الهويه المعماريه الفلسطينيه القديمه في رام الله، اسمه: مركز المعمار الشعبي \"رواق\"، والذي عمل على تحضير مخططات حمايه للمباني في التجمعات، وبخاصه تلك التي ما زالت تحافظ على مراكزها ونسيجها المعماري القديم، وكذلك تلك التي تحتوي على عدد كبير من المباني القديمه، بحيث تتم حمايه اكبر نسبه ممكنه من المباني القديمه بمجرد حمايه بعض التجمعات، ولذلك يمكن حمايه ما نسبته 35.41 % من عدد المباني القديمه بمجرد حمايه التجمعات التي تحتوي على اكثر من 200 مبنى قديم.\nوقد قامت وحده التخطيط في مركز رواق، باعداد مخطط الحفاظ على التراث الثقافي للبلده القديمه في رام الله. حيث تم تعيين حدود وجميع فئات التراث الثقافي في المنطقه التاريخيه (من مباني تاريخيه، واحواش، وازقه...الخ) وذلك بناءً على الدراسه الميدانيه التي قام بها فريق العمل في الموقع.\nنتيجه ذلك تم تقسيم البلده القديمه الى منطقتين: «منطقه تاريخيه ا» والتي تتميز بنسيج معماري تقليدي وعدد كبير من المباني التاريخيه، و«منطقه تاريخيه ب» والتي لم تعد تحتفظ بنسيج معماري تقليدي بالرغم من وجود عدد لا باس به من المباني التاريخيه. هذا وتم تعين كل المباني التاريخيه المنفرده خارج هاتين المنطقتين.\nكما وتم وضع مسوده احكام خاصه لتنظيم اعمال البناء في تللك المناطق، والتي تم نقاشها مطولاً مع لجنه احياء البلده القديمه المكونه من اعضاء في مجلس بلديه رام الله. هذا وتم اقرار جزء من هذه الاحكام من قبل لجنه التنظيم في البلديه.\n\nالثقافه والسياحه\nان ما يميز مدينه رام الله هو هذا التناغم والتنوع والاختلاف في اطار الوحده، ولكثره من رغب بالسكن في رام الله بسبب هذا الميل العام نحو قبول الاخر، جعل منها مكان جذب للكثيرين من مختلف المناطق والبيئات والاديان ممن بحثوا عن الامن والامان. وقد خلق هذا الامر ايضاً تنوعاً ثقافياً وحضارياً فريداً، ووجد الجميع فيه ما يصبون اليه فتشكلت هذه المدينه المنوعه في ثقافتها وتوجهاتها في اطار من التواصل الغريب.\nتعتبر رام الله مركز للحياه الثقافيه والاكثر انفتاحا وليبراليه في الضفه الغربيه، ما دفع البعض الى تسميتها «روح الثقافه» فهي تضم العديد من المكتبات مثل: مكتبه دار الاذاعه ومكتبه رام الله العامه بالاضافه الى العديد من المراكز الثقافيه على تنوعها، فهناك العامله في اطار الفنون البصريه، او السينما او المسرح، او الرقص الشعبي والمعاصر، او الشعر والادب والنشر، او المؤسسات الموسيقيه.\nوتعتبر رام الله مركزا للعديد من المراكز الثقافيه الاجنبيه كالمركز الثقافي الالماني الفرنسي، والمركز الثقافي البريطاني، والمركز الثقافي اليوناني.\nولتطريز الاثواب في رام الله نكهه خاصه فهي لغه للتعبير وحاله نادره ومميزه عن بقيه المناطق الاخرى، بحيث يدمج بين الاشكال الهندسيه والمجرده المستطيله (كالمربعات، والنجوم) وبين الصور الرمزيه، ما يعكس الحياه اليوميه لاهل رام الله وسكانها. ومن اهم المهرجانات التي تقام خصيصا من اجل الحفاظ على هذا التراث، مهرجان الوفاء للتراث وارث الاجداد السنوي الذي ينظمه نادي شباب رام الله، حيث يتم تنظيم عرضاً للازياء التراثيه الفلسطينيه.\nكما وتضم عددا من المراكز الرياضيه، والانديه الشبابيه الفاعله، والتي يعود تاسيس بعضها الى بدايات القرن الماضي، في حين تضم بعض هذه الانديه فرقا كشفيه عريقه كان لها حضورها على مدار التاريخ الفلسطيني. من المؤسسات العامله في مجال الثقافه في المدينه مركز الفن الشعبي ومعهد ادوارد سعيد للموسيقى ومسرح وسينماتك القصبه ومؤسسه سريه رام الله الاولى والقصر الثقافي التابع لبلديه المدينه ومركز بلدنا الثقافي ورواق وشاشات ومسرح عشتار ومركز خليل السكاكيني الثقافي ومؤسسه الكمنجاتي وجالاري المحطه ومؤسسه تامر ومنتدى الفنانين الصغار والمركز الثقافي البريطاني ومؤسسه عبد المحسن القطّان، والتي تعمل على تفعيل الحياه الثقافيه في فلسطين من خلال انتاج اعمال مسرحيه واستضافه عروض فنيه في مجالات المسرح والموسيقى والرقص بالاضافه الى عرض الافلام السينمائيه اليوميه وتنظيم الاسابيع والمهرجانات السينمائيه المتخصصه.\nوتضم رام الله كذلك، عددا من الجمعيات الخيريه، النسويه في مجملها، ويعود تاسيس بعضها الى اربعينيات القرن الماضي، وتهدف هذه الجمعيات التي تضاعفت اعدادها مرارا في العقدين الاخيرين، الى توفير الدعم للعديد من فئات المجتمع، ومن بينها المراه، الطفل، كبار السن، ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصه، الايتام، وغيرهم.\n\nتعتبر مدينه رام الله واحده من المدن الفلسطينيه التي يؤمها السياح، وتشكل وجهه رئيسيه لهم في جولاتهم السياحيه، ولا بد للسائح ان يزور مواقعها الاثريه التي تقسم الى: انقاض بناء اثري فيه بقايا برج من حقبه الصليبيين يقع في وسط المدينه، واثار كنيسه بيزنطيه في المدينه.\nوبالرغم من ان المدينه ليست من المدن القديمه جدا الا انها تعد اكثر المناطق الفلسطينيه جذبا للزائرين على المستوى العالمي والعربي عامه والفلسطينيين خاصه، اخذين بعين الاعتبار ان هذه المدينه مركزا اقتصاديا مهما، وخاصه بعد ان اصبحت مقرا للمصارف الفلسطينيه والعربيه، ومركزا للمؤسسات الاجنبيه، والممثليات الدبلوماسيه، كما ومقرا لمؤسسات ووزارات السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه...الخ، مما ساهم بشكل فعال في تطور هذه المدينه من كافه النواحي وخاصه سياحيا، فازدحام المدينه يعني بناء المرافق السياحيه الكبيره والحديثه القادره على تلبيه احتياجات ساكنيها، وهذا من شانه ان يزيد الدخل القومي بشكل كبير. ويوجد في المدينه مركزا معني بالسياحه هو مركز رام الله للمعلومات السياحيه الذي تاسس بدعم سويدي وبالتعاون مع وزاره السياحه الفلسطينيه ومركز رواق للمعمار الشعبي. وهناك الكثير من الاثار الواقعه في قرى وبلدات قضاء رام الله، فمثلا توجد قلعه حصينه لا تزال اثارها ظاهره حتى الان في بيرزيت، مبنى عثماني ضخم في قريه راس كركر، واثار كنيسه وقطع معماريه تعود الى الفترات البيزنطيه في قريه جفنا، كما يوجد في قريه عابود الكثير من الاديره والكنائس المندثره منذ عهد هيلانه وابنها قسطنطين، وفيها ايضا مسجد قديم وكنيسه للروم الارثوذكس. ويزور رام الله سنويا 300,000 سائح. يشار الى ان السياحه في المدينه كغيرها من مدن فلسطين، تواجه العديد من المشاكل والعقبات، ولعل اول تلك العقبات هو الاحتلال الاسرائيلي الذي يؤثر سلبا بدعاياته المغرضه على السياح الاجانب، ويسعى الى ضرب قطاع السياحه في المدينه. كذلك ينافس الاسرائيليون السياحه الفلسطينيه نظرا لخبرتهم في التسويق.\n\nالتعليم والتعليم العالي\nبدا التعليم في رام الله في مدرسه للروم الاورثوذكس انشاتها البطريركيه في القدس حوالي 1840، عندما حضر مبشر من طائفه البروتستانت اسمه صموئيل غوبات واسس خمس مدارس احداها في رام الله، وهي مدرسه تبشيريه، بينما كانت الاولى الارثوذكسيه مدرسه وطنيه، وظلت مدرسه غوبات مفتوحه حتى قبل الحرب العالميه الاولى، وفي سنه 1857 قدم اللاتين الى رام الله، وافتتحوا لهم مدرسه لم تعمر طويلا، اما عن مدارس الاناث، فقد اسست جماعه الفرندز في عام 1889 اول مدرسه من نوعها للاناث في رام الله. والاولى من نوعها في فلسطين، وكان افتتاح هذه المدرسه حافزاً للروم الارثوذكس لانشاء مدرسه للبنات، وحذا حذوهم اللاتين، وفي عام 1901 افتتح الفرندز مدرسه البنين في رام الله.\nوفي رام الله اليوم ثلاث مدارس حكوميه للذكور ومدرستان للاناث، وبعد عام 1950 افتتحت بعض المعاهد مثل معهد المعلمات الحكومي والحق بالمعهد مدرسه للتطبيقات والتجارب التربويه والتعليم فيها مختلط، ولوكاله الغوث اربع مدارس للذكور ومدرستان للاناث في رام الله كما يتبع وكاله الغوث مركز لتدريب المعلمين والفتيات وهناك سبع مدارس خاصه مختلطه وثلاث مدارس خاصه للاناث وواحده للذكور ودار لرعايه الاحداث وكليه بيرزيت التي تحولت الى جامعه وتعتبر من اهم الجامعات الفلسطينيه.\nكما ان مدينه رام الله تعتبر مركزاً للنشاط الثقافي في الضفه الغربيه اذ تمتلئ بالمسارح ودور السينما والمراكز الثقافيه، وفيها المعهد الوطني للموسيقى ومجموعه كبيره من المنتديات الثقافيه.\nالتعليم العالي\nتقع في محافظه رام الله واحده من الجامعات المميزه فلسطينيا وعربيا، وهي جامعه بيرزيت. يعود تاريخ جامعه بيرزيت الى عام 1924 عندما تاسست كمدرسه ابتدائيه، وكان الهدف الرئيسي للمدرسه توفير فرص التعليم الاوليه للفتيات من بيرزيت والقرى المجاوره في وقت انعدمت فيه المدارس تقريباً في تلك المنطقه.\nتطورت المدرسه لتصبح كليه عام 1942، ولما كانت الكليه عندئذ هي المؤسسه الجامعيه الوحيده في المنطقه، فقد قررت التركيز على التعليم الجامعي، وتقرر ان تصبح الكليه نتيجه لذلك «جامعه بيرزيت» في 1972.\n\nالرياضه\nتلعب في محافظه رام الله العديد من الانديه سواء على مستوى كره القدم او كره السله، منها: مؤسسه شباب البيره، دير عمار، الجلزون، شباب الامعري، ارثوذكسي رام الله، سلواد، بدو، بيت سيرا، وبير زيت الرياضي. ويشارك بعضها في الدوري الفلسطيني الممتاز. ويوجد في المدينه ملعبا بلديا يتسع لعده الاف.\nيقام في مدينه رام الله سباق ماراثون يحمل اسم «القدس عاصمه فلسطين الابديه»، وذلك رداً على سباق مماثل اقيم في المدينه المحتله بمشاركه الاف العدائين الاسرائيليين والاجانب وسط موجه غضب في الشارع الفلسطيني. كما بدات بلديه رام الله باعمال الانشاء لمشروع صاله رام الله الرياضيه. وياتي مشروع الصاله الرياضيه كجزء من الخطه التنمويه للبلديه.\n\nالاعلام\nخرج من رام الله الكثير من المشاهير الفلسطينيين منهم:\n\nكمال ناصر: سياسي وشاعر فلسطيني شارك في اصدار جريده (البعث) كما اصدر مجله الجيل الجديد عام 1949 في القدس. انتخب عام 1969

الكبرى.\n\nالمعالم\nرام الله تحت الاحتلال\nمنذ بدايه الانتفاضه الثانيه للفلسطينيين ضد الاحتلال الاسرائيلي واجتياح جيش الاحتلال الاسرائيلي مدن الضفه الغربيه في خريف عام 2000، كانت مدينه رام الله من المدن الرئيسيه في مواجهه العمليات الاسرائيليه بعد مدن جنين، نابلس، طولكرم، الخليل، هذا وقد فرضت قوات الاحتلال الاسرائيليه حظر التجول على المدينه، وخنقت سكانها وعزلتهم عن مدينه القدس حيث يقطن الكثير من اقربائهم.\nو تعيش مدينه رام الله اليوم ظروف صعبه، بسبب الحصار الاسرائيلي ومصادره الكثير من اراضيها من قبل الاحتلال بواسطه جدار الفصل العنصري، والمستوطنين اليهود.\nومع مرور سنوات عديده على الانتفاضه الثانيه، الا ان مدينه رام الله واهلها نجحوا في الحفاظ على نشاط اقتصادي عالي وثقافي مميز، مما جعل المدينه افضل المدن الفلسطينيه حالا في ظل الاحتلال.\n\nالمخيمات\nيوجد في منطقه رام الله، 4 مخيمات 3 منها مُسجله رسميا في وكاله غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (الاونروا) وواحد غير مسجل، وهي مثل باقي المخيمات في الضفه الغربيه، فقد بُني معظمها فوق قطعه من الارض قامت الاونروا باستئجارها من الحكومه الاردنيه. والمخيمات هي:\n\nمخيم الامعري: قام الصليب الاحمر بتاسيس مخيم الامعري في عام 1949 ضمن حدود بلديه البيره، حيث قام بتوفير الخيام للاجئين الذين قدموا من مدن اللد ويافا والرمله، بالاضافه الى الذين لجئوا من قرى بيت دجن ودير طريف وابو شوشه والنعاني وصيدون وجمزو وبيت نبالا. وقد تسلمت الاونروا مسؤوليه المخيم في عام 1950 وعملت على بناء وحدات سكنيه ذات اسقف اسمنتيه. وبحلول عام 1957، كانت الاونروا قد اتمت استبدال كافه الخيام بالمساكن الاسمنتيه؛ حيث حصلت العائلات التي لا يزيد عدد افرادها عن خمسه اشخاص على مسكن مؤلف من غرفه واحده فيما حصلت العائلات الاكبر على مساكن من غرفتين. واليوم، فان المخيم يغطي مساحه من الارض تبلغ 0,93 كيلومتر مربع، ويفصل بين معظم المساكن مساحه تقل عن نصف متر؛ الامر الذي يجعل التهويه داخل المخيم ضعيفه للغايه. ويرتبط المخيم بشكل كامل بشبكتي الماء والكهرباء البلديه.\nمخيم الجلزون: تاسس المخيم عام 1949 فوق مساحه من الارض تبلغ 0.25 كيلومتر مربع على تله صخريه تبعد مسافه 7 كيلومترات شمال رام الله. وينحدر اصل سكان المخيم من 36 قريه تابعه لمناطق اللد والرمله. واصبح المخيم تحت السيطره الاسرائيليه الفلسطينيه المشترك في اعقاب اتفاقيات اوسلو. وتتصل كافه المساكن بالبنيه التحتيه لشبكتي الكهرباء والماء العامه.\nمخيم دير عمار: تاسس المخيم عام 1949 فوق مساحه من الارض تبلغ 0.16 كيلومتر مربع على بعد 30 كيلومتر الى الشمال الغربي من رام الله. وقد بني المخيم فوق قطعه من الارض تعود ملكيتها لسكان قريه دير عمار غير اللاجئين. وفي المقابل، فان منشات الاونروا في المخيم تعمل على توفير خدماتها للقرويين من غير اللاجئين.\nوتنحدر اصول سكان المخيم من القرى المدمره التابعه لمناطق الرمله ويافا واللد. وفي اعقاب اتفاقيات اوسلو، اصبح المخيم واقعا تحت السيطره المشتركه الفلسطينيه الاسرائيليه.\n\nمخيم قدوره: يقع داخل مدينه رام الله بالقرب من مستشفى رام الله الحكومي من جهه الشمال، يبلغ عدد سكانه في منتصف العام 2023 نحو 1040 لاجئ حسب تقديرات الجهاز المركزي للاحصاء الفلسطيني. معظم سكان المخيم من المدن والقرى المهجره عام 1948 منها: دير طريف، واللد، والسافريه، وبيت نبالا، والرمله، ولفتا، وابو غوش، والقباب، ويافا، وسلمه، وزكريا، والحديثه، وعمواس، ويالو؛ ومن نازحي عام 1967.\n\nالمستوطنات\nما ان اندلعت حرب 1967 والتي كانت نتائجها احتلال ما تبقى من ارض فلسطين - الضفه الغربيه وقطاع غزه، حتى سارعت اسرائيل في وضع الخطط بهدف اقامه العديد من المستوطنات. وكانت رام الله جزءا من هذا المخطط، حيث بنت اسرائيل في منطقه رام الله حوالي 27 مستوطنه وهي:\nمستوطنات تتوسط مجموعه من البلدات الفلسطينيه وهي: المديه، نعلين، دير قديس، حزما، عين حارث، بلعين، ام صفا وبيت سيرا:\n\nمكابيم اب\nكفار روث\nمستوطنه منوره\nشلتا نتتياهو\nحشمونائيم\nكريات سيفر\nوهناك مستوطنات تطوق مدينه رام الله وتسيطر على معظم اراضيها، وهي من الشرق:\n\nتلمون\nياد يائير\nبيت حورون\nجفعات زئيف\nبيت ايل\nبسجوت\nكوخاف يعقوب\nومن الجنوب:\n\nمستوطنه عطروت\nجفعون\nجفعات حداشا ا\nجبعات حدشاه ب\nاما التجمع الاستيطاني شمال شرق رام الله، فيضم مستوطنات: عوفرا، بيت ايل ا، بيت ايل بمعسكر (باعل حتسور)، الذي يطل على منطقه الاغوار الوسطى واريحا والبحر الميت، على ارتفاع 800 متر عن سطح البحر، وهو ذو اهميه استراتيجيه؛ نظراً لارتفاعه واشرافه على مساحات واسعه من مناطق وسط الضفه، ويبلغ عدد المستوطنين في ذلك التجمع نحو 5370 مستوطناً. ويشغل مساحه تبلغ اكثر من 2000 دونم.\n\nمدن متوامه\nالمدن الشقيقه لرام الله هي:\n\nالمراجع\nوصلات خارجيه\n\nموقع بلديه رام الله\nغرفه تجاره وصناعه محافظه رام

          "content": "Jenin ( zhin-EEN; Arabic: جنين, romanized: Jinīn, locally pronounced [ʒɪˈniːn] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and is the capital of the Jenin Governorate. It is a hub for the surrounding towns. Jenin came under Israeli occupation in 1967, and was put under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank, a Palestinian enclave, in 1995.\nThe city had a population of approximately 50,000 people in 2017, whilst the Jenin refugee camp had a population of about 10,000, housing families of Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 Palestine War. The camp has since become a stronghold of Palestinian militants, being the location of several incidents relating to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.\n\nEtymology\nJenin has been identified as the place \"Gina\" or \"Ginah\" mentioned in the Amarna letters from the 14th century BCE, as a town in Canaan. Jenin is commonly identified with the later biblical city of Ein-Ganim, from Hebrew: עֵין גַּנִּים, meaning \"the spring of gardens\" or \"the spring of Ganim\", probably referring to the many springs located nearby. The present-day Arabic name is believed to preserve the city's ancient name.\n\nHistory\nAncient period\nJenin is identified with a number of important towns mentioned in ancient sources. Throughout history, it was referred to as \"Ein Ganim\", \"Beth Hagan\", \"Ginah\", and \"Ginae\", along other names.\nTell Jenin, believed to constitute the original settlement core of the city, is located at the center of what is today Jenin's business district. The tell is also known as Tell el-Nawar, a term derived from the Arabic word for \"gypsies,\" due to former nomadic encampments in this site. The earliest settlement at the tell dates to the late Neolithic and the early Chalcolithic. In the early 20th century, the tell was occupied by a modern cemetery and a threshing floor.\n\nBronze Age\nJenin has been identified as the place Gina or Ginah mentioned in the Amarna letters from the 14th century BCE. At the time, it was a vassal state of the New Kingdom of Egypt. The people of Gina managed to kill the warlord Labaya during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten.\n\nIron Age\nJenin is identical to Ein-Ganim, which the Hebrew Bible describes as a Levite city belonging to the Israelite Tribe of Issachar. It has also been associated with Beth-Haggan, mentioned in 2 Kings in connection with Ahaziah's flight from Jehu, before he is wounded at Ibleam and later dies in Megiddo. The Book of Judith renders its name as Gini.\n\nRoman and Byzantine periods\nJosephus, a Roman-Jewish historian of the 1st-century CE, mentions Ginae as being in the great plain, on the northern border of Samaria. During the Roman period, Ginae was settled exclusively by Samaritans. The people of Galilee were disposed to pass through their city during the annual pilgrimages to Jerusalem. In 51 CE, a Galilean Jew was killed in Ginae by hostile Samaritans while en route to Jerusalem to celebrate Sukkot. With Roman procurator Cumanus failing to respond, Jewish Zealots led by Elazar the Son of Deinaeus (Ben Dinai) sought vengeance, and several Samaritan villages in Aqrabatene were destroyed.\nBiblical commentator F. W. Farrar raised the possibility that this Samaritan village, \"the first village at which [a traveler taking the road from Galilee to Judea over Mount Tabor] would arrive\", was the one which rejected the disciples of Jesus in Luke's Gospel at the point where Jesus and his followers begin his journey towards Jerusalem.\nCeramics dating from the Byzantine era have been found here. There is no mention of Jenin in the reports of the Muslim conquest of the Levant from the Byzantines, which, according to the historian Moshe Sharon, \"is not surprising, since it was a small place of minor importance\".\n\nCrusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods\nJenin came under Crusader rule in 1103. The Crusaders called it Le Grand Guerin (Latin: Garinum or Gallina Major), to distinguish it from the town of Zir'in, which they called Petit Grin. Under the Crusaders it was a small seigniory, forming part of the Principality of Galilee or the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\nShortly before the Battle of Hattin in 1187, Jenin was captured by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin, who destroyed the nearby fort, Castellum Beleismum. In the 1220s, the geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi described Jenin as \"a small and beautiful town, lying between Nabulus and Beisan, in the Jordan Province. There is much water, and many springs are found here, and often have I visited it.\" In 1229, a peace was concluded between Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and Sultan al-Kamil, during the Sixth Crusade, whereby the city was given to the Crusaders, but Sultan as-Salih Ayyub was able to control it permanently in 1244 after the Battle of La Forbie.\nIn 1255, it was agreed between the Ayyubid sultan in Syria, an-Nasir Yusuf, and the first Mamluk sultan in Egypt, Izz al-Din Aybak, to give the latter all of the lands lying west of the Jordan River, and thus Jenin entered into the possession of the Mamluks. It was one of eleven subdistricts of Mamlakat Safad (Province of Safed). In the late 13th century, Mamluk emirs (commanders) stationed at Jenin were ordered by Sultan Qalawun (r. 1279–1290) \"to ride every day with their troops before the fortress of 'Akka, so as to protect the coast and the merchants.\" As one of the stations of the Mamluk barid (postal route) between the Mamluk capital Cairo and Damascus, it was one of the towns where fires were lit to warn of a Mongol attack. The geographer al-Dimashqi mentioned Jenin around 1300. From the time of Qalawun's son, Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1299–1309, 1310–1341), it was a station on the route where ice was transported to Cairo for the sultans' drink houses. The Mamluk historian al-Qalqashandi (d. 1418) described Jenin as \"an ancient spacious town which is riding on a shoulder of a nice valley in which there is a river of flowing water\" north of Qaqun \"on the top end of Marj Bani Amer [Jezreel Valley]\". He also noted that it contained the mausoleum of Dihyah al-Kalbi, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nOttoman era\nThe Ottomans conquered Mamluk Syria in 1516. Jenin became the administrative center of a nahiya (subdistrict) of the Lajjun Sanjak (Lajjun District). The sanjak was officially called the Iqta (Fief) of Turabay until 1559 when it became officially known as the Lajjun Sanjak. The Turabay dynasty was the ruling house of the Bedouin Banu Haritha tribe, whose members held the governorship of Lajjun from the start of Ottoman rule through 1677.\nThe tax registers from 1548 to 1549 report that Jenin had a population of eight households, all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 2,000 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf (religious endowment) in the name of the Mamluk sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri (r. 1501–1516). Turabay rule was occasionally interrupted, including in 1564, when a certain Kemal Bey was appointed sanjak-bey (district governor) by the Ottomans. On 15 October 1564 Kemal Bey requested from the beylerbey (provincial governor) of Damascus that the stone caravanserai of Jenin be repaired, garrisoned and serve as the chief headquarters of the Lajjun sanjak-bey in order for Lajjun to prosper and for the road connecting Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt to become secure. The official response was that the caravanserai be turned into a fortress; the fortress became ruined at some later point and 19th-century residents of Jenin used to claim that certain large rocks strewn in the village were the remnants of the 16th-century fortress.\nThe Turabays, who remained nomads in the plain between Mount Carmel and Caesarea, made Jenin the administrative headquarters of Lajjun and used the town's Izz al-Din Cemetery to bury their dead. A large, domed mausoleum was built for the grave of one of the chiefs and sanjak-beys of the family, Turabay ibn Ali (d. 1601). Known as Qubbat al-Amir Turabay (Dome of the Emir Turabay), it was described in a 1941 report as a ruined structure, and Sharon, writing in 2017, notes that it \"does not exist anymore\". No other graves of the Turabays in Jenin had survived into the 20th century. During the conflict between Fakhr al-Din of the Ma'n dynasty, who governed the sanjaks of Sidon-Beirut and Safed, and the Turabays, in 1623, Fakhr al-Din captured Jenin and stationed his men there. In 1624 the most prominent Turabay chief and sanjak-bey of Lajjun, Ahmad ibn Turabay, drove out the Ma'nid troops from Jenin and established his personal residence in the town.\nIn the mid-18th century, Jenin was designated the administrative capital of the combined districts of Lajjun and Ajlun. There are indications that the area comprising Jenin and Nablus remained functionally autonomous under Ottoman rule and that the empire struggled to collect taxes there. During the Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt which extended into Syria and Palestine in 1799, a local official from Jenin wrote a poem enumerating and calling upon local Arab leaders to resist Bonaparte, without mentioning the Sultan or the need to protect the Ottoman Empire.\nIn the late 19th century, some members of the Jarrar family, who formed part of the mallakin (elite land-owning families) in Jenin, cooperated with merchants in Haifa to set up an export enterprise there. During the Ottoman era, Jenin was plagued by local warfare between members of the same clan. The French explorer Guérin visited in 1870. In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Jenin as \"The capital of the district, the seat of a Caimacam, a town of about 3,000 inhabitants, with a small bazaar. The houses are well built of stone. There are two families of Roman Catholics; the remainder are Moslems. A spring rises east of the town and is conducted to a large masonry reservoir, near the west side, of good squared stonework, with a long stone trough. This reservoir was built by 'And el Hady, Mudir of Acre, in the first half of the century  [..], north of the town is the little mosque of 'Ezz ed Din, with a good- sized dome and a minaret.\"\n\nBritish Mandate period\nAccording to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Jenin had a population of 2,637 (2,307 Muslims, 212 Hindus, 108 Christians, seven Jews, and three Sikhs). A following census in 1931 showed a slight increase to 2,706 (2,610 Muslims, 103 Christians, two Jews, and one Druze) with another 68 in nearby suburbs (all Muslims). From 1936, Jenin became a center of rebellion against the British Mandatory authorities. By the summer of 1938, residents of the city embarked on \"an intensified campaign of murder, intimidation and sabotage\" that caused the British administration \"grave concern\", according to a British report to the League of Nations; the population had further increased to 3,100. The city played an important role in the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, prompted by the death of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam in a fire-fight with British colonial police at the nearby town of Ya'bad months prior to the start of the revolt. On 25 August 1938, the day after the British Assistant District Commissioner was assassinated in his Jenin office, a large British force with explosives entered the town. Despite having captured and killed the assassin, British forces ordered the inhabitants to leave, and blew up one quarter of the town as a form of punishment.\nJenin was used by Fawzi al-Qawuqji's Arab Liberation Army as a base.\nThe village statistics of 1945 list the population as 3,990 (3,840 Muslims and 150 Christians).\n\n1948 War\nIn the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the city was defended by the Iraqi Army, then captured briefly by the forces from Israel's Carmeli Brigade during the \"Ten Days' fighting\" following the cancellation of the first cease-fire. Prior to the battle, the city's residents fled temporarily. The offensive was actually a feint designed to draw Arab forces away from the critical Battle for Jerusalem, and gains in that sector were quickly abandoned when Arab reinforcements arrived.\n\nJordanian control\nIn the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Jenin came under Jordanian rule. It was annexed by Jordan in 1950.\nThe Jenin refugee camp was founded in 1953 by Jordan to house displaced Palestinians who fled or were expelled during the 1948 War. In 2014 the camp had a population of 16,000. For 19 years, the city was under Jordanian control. A war cemetery for Iraqi soldiers and local combatants is located on the outskirts of Jenin.\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 14,402 inhabitants in Jenin.\n\nIsraeli occupation 1967 to 2020\nJenin has been under Israeli occupation since the Six-Day War, in 1967.\nOn 14 May 1989, during the early months of the First Intifada. Mohammad Jibrin, aged 45, died in Ramallah Hospital after being beaten by Israeli soldiers in Jenin. Three months later, in response to a question from a member of Knesset Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin wrote that there was no investigation by the Military Police Investigator.\nAccording to Joel Beinin, Jenin was classified as under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank, a Palestinian enclave, in 1995. In 1996, Israel handed over control of the city to the Palestinian National Authority in keeping with the Oslo Accords.\nAccording to the BBC, the city is \"Known among Palestinians\" as \"the Martyrs' capital\", but the reason they gave was Israeli statistics about suicide bombings, the BBC did not identify any non-Israeli source for the name. During the Second Palestinian uprising (also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada) the camp's militants, some 200 armed men, included members of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, Tanzim, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas. By Israel's count, at least 28 suicide bombers were dispatched from the Jenin camp from 2000 to 2003 during the Second Intifada. Israeli army weekly Bamahane attributes at least 31 militant attacks, totaling 124 victims, to Jenin during the same period, more than any other city in the West Bank.\nDuring the al-Aqsa Intifada, Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield with the stated aim of dismantling militant infrastructure so as to curb suicide bombings and other militant activities. The army encircled and entered six major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank, among them Jenin. During the Battle of Jenin (2002) in April 2002, 23 Israeli soldiers and 52 Palestinians, including civilians,  were killed. Human Rights Watch reported that the refugee camp, which was the major battleground, suffered extensive damage. Witnesses stated unarmed people were shot and denied medical treatment, and as a result died. Human Rights Watch have regarded many killings to be unlawful such as the death of a 57-year-old wheelchair bound man who was shot and run over by a tank despite having attached a white flag on his wheelchair. A 37-year-old man who was paralysed was crushed under the rubble of his house, his family was not allowed to remove his body. A 14-year-old boy was killed as he travelled to purchase groceries during the temporary relief of the curfew that was imposed by the army. Medical staff were shot at (one nurse killed) while trying to reach the wounded even after clearly being in uniform displaying the red crescent symbol. There have also been reports of Israeli soldiers using Palestinians as human shields, one father described how a soldier rested his rifle on his 14-year-old son's shoulder as he shot. Israel denied the entry of rescue teams and journalists into Jenin even after they withdrew. Over the following years, Jenin was subject to extended curfews and targeted killings.\nDuring a gun-battle with Islamic Jihad militants whom Israel says were firing at troops from inside the UN compound, an Israeli military sniper shot and killed a UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) employee, Iain Hook (54) on November 22, 2002. The sniper reportedly mistook a cellphone in Hook's hands for a gun or grenade.\n\nIn the framework of the Valley of Peace initiative, a joint Arab-Israeli project is under way to promote tourism in the Jenin region. In 2010, 600 new businesses opened in Jenin. The Canaan Fair Trade is headquartered in Jenin. Director of The Freedom Theatre in Jenin, Juliano Mer-Khamis, was killed by masked gunmen in the city in April 2011. Mer-Khamis co-founded the theatre with Zakaria Zubeidi, former military chief of the al-Aqsa Brigades who had renounced violence.\n\nIsraeli occupation in the 2020s\nOn 6 February 2020, a Palestinian policeman, Tarek Badwan, was shot dead by an Israeli sniper as he stood at the entrance to the Jenin police station and chatted with a colleague. No explanation has been forthcoming. The incident was recorded on video.\nOn 17 June 2022, Israeli forces conducted a raid in the al-Marah area of the city. During the raid, Israeli forces opened fire on a car, killing three Palestinians and seriously injuring another.\n\nOn 26 January 2023, Israeli forces killed nine in a clash with Islamic Jihad militants during a raid in the city and refugee camp of Jenin.\nOn 3 July 2023, shortly after 1 a.m., Israeli forces attacked the city's refugee camp using drone-fired missiles and ground troops. Eight Palestinians died from injuries sustained during the attack and a further eighty were injured, nine of them critically. Fifty Palestinians, whom Israeli forces labeled \"militants\", were arrested. Israeli forces cut off telecommunications and electricity in the area and medical professionals struggled to reach the injured. Israel claimed that while they were targeting suspected members of the Jenin Brigades, an armed group, they acknowledged that innocent people may have been injured or killed in the raid. Yoav Gallant, the Israeli Minister of Defense, said \"The operation is progressing as planned,\" and Eli Cohen, the Israeli Foreign Minister, said claimed the refugee camp had become a \"center for terrorist activity\" thanks to funding from Iranian sources. The refugee camp has a population of roughly 17,000 inhabitants and is about a quarter a square mile in size.\nOn 19 September 2023, four Palestinians were killed during another Israeli military invasion of the city – among them a 15-year-old Palestinian boy, chased and killed for having noticed the Israeli undercover soldiers sneaking into the Jenin refugee camp.\n\nGaza war\nDuring the Gaza war, Israeli forces carried out multiple operations in Jenin. On October 22, 2023, the IDF conducted an airstrike targeting an underground compound beneath the Al-Ansar Mosque in the city. It was reported to be the first airstrike in the West Bank since the Second Intifada. The IDF stated that the strike aimed at operatives from Hamas and PIJ who were planning a terror attack.\nJenin was severely damaged during the Gaza war. By June 2024 repeated bombing attacks and incursions with bulldozers by Israeli forces razed every street and reduced every public square to rubble. In one incident on 21 May, according to journalist Gideon Levy, an Israeli sniper shot dead bystanders, including surgeon Oussaid Jabareen, who was shot while on his way to work at the Jenin Government Hospital.\n\nIn late August 2024 Israel launched a large-scale, multi-day raid on Jenin as part of Operation Summer Camps, with one resident saying that \"The water is cut off. The electricity is cut off, the sewage system is no longer working. All the infrastructure is destroyed, we no longer have any services that work.\" The governor of Jenin said that \"The Israelis are besieging the hospitals and cutting off the city from the refugee camp, which has become a military zone with no access...neither the civil defence, nor the ambulances, nor the journalists can go and see what is happening there.\" The IDF, on the other hand, says that this is operation is \"not extremely different from regular activity\". At least 20 Palestinians were killed by the IDF in this attack, including a Palestinian man in his 80s. Additionally, the Israeli forces fired at ambulances carrying \"a dead and a wounded person\", leading to the injury of 2 EMTs and a volunteer doctor.\nAlso in August, Israeli bulldozers destroyed miles of the city, including homes, businesses and infrastructure; Israeli soldiers blocked emergency responders from assisting residents. News reports include videos of this attack, as well as assertions by the Israel Defense Forces that it is rooting out terrorism; and that it \"undertakes all feasible precautions to avoid damaging essential infrastructure”, while acknowledging that these “operations in the area have caused unavoidable harm to certain civilian structures\".\nIn December 2024, the Palestinian Authority launched an anti-militant operation in Jenin, the largest in three decades, called \"Protect the Homeland\". The operation aims to regain control of the Jenin refugee camp, targeting militants and those fueling instability.\nOn January 21, 2025, the IDF launched its own operation in Jenin, dubbed Iron Wall, aimed at clearing Jenin of militants and putting a stop to light arms being smuggled into the city. Operations in Jenin were ongoing as of late February 2025. Around 100 homes had been demolished, residents were being prevented from returning to the area by military checkpoints, and Israeli tanks had been deployed.\n\nGeography\nJenin is situated at the foot of the rugged northernmost hills (Jabal Nablus) of the West Bank, and along the southern edge of the Jezreel Valley (Marj Ibn Amer), which the city overlooks. Its highest elevation is about 250 meters above sea level and its lowest areas are 90 meters above sea level. Immediately southwest of Jenin is the Sahl Arraba plain (Dothan Valley), while further south is the Marj Sanur valley.

Six seats each were won by Hamas and the local coalition of Fatah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Jenin was one of several Palestinian cities where Hamas showed a dramatic growth in electoral support.\n Hadem Rida was then elected as Mayor of the city, until he was arrested by the Israel Forces and spent 3 years in jail. After his release, he resigned from the position and went back to practice in his clinic in Jenin city.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2017 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Jenin had a population of 49,908, the Jenin Refugee Camp of 10,417 on 373 dunams (92 acres).

According to local traditions, he was a descendant of Ali Zayn al-Abidin, the grandson of Muhammad and the sixth Sh'ia Imam. According to a local tradition, Sheikh Izz al-Din fought alongside Saladin against the Crusaders. The tomb possibly predates the cemetery, which served as a burial site for the people of Jenin and the Turabay dynasty.

          "content": "جِنِين مدينه فلسطينيه، ومركز محافظه جنين واكبر مدنها، تقع في شمال الضفه الغربيه المحتله التابعه للسلطه الفلسطينيه. تعتبر تاريخيًا، احدى مدن المثلث في شمال فلسطين، وتبعد عن القدس مسافه 75 كيلومترًا الى الشمال. تطل جنين على غور الاردن من ناحيه الشرق، ومرج بن عامر الى جهه الشمال.\nبالرغم من قله عدد سكانها حتى تاريخ وقوع النكبه مقارنه بالمدن الفلسطينيه الاخرى، الا ان لها ثقلا اقتصاديا اكبر بكثير من حجمها السكاني. في عام 2017، بلغ عدد سكان مدينه جنين 48,479 نسمه بينما بلغ عدد سكان مخيم جنين للاجئين حوالي 10 الاف نسمه، حيث يسكنه عائلات من الفلسطينيين الذين فروا او طردوا من منازلهم خلال حرب فلسطين عام 1948، اما المحافظه فيقطنها حوالي 314,866 نسمه.\nتصل مساحه مدينه جنين وحدها الى 21,000 دونم، مما يجعلها خامس اكبر مدينه فلسطينيه في الضفه الغربيه بعد مدن الخليل ونابلس وطولكرم ويطا، بينما تبلغ مساحه محافظه جنين 583 كيلومترًا مربعًا اي 9,7% من مساحه الضفه الغربيه الاجماليه. يتبع المدينه مخيم جنين الذي يقع غربها ويسكنه 16,000 لاجئ. وترتفع المدينه عن سطح البحر بمعدل 175 متراً.\nعُرفت جنين بعدد من الاسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسم المدينه في مصادر واثار المصريين القدماء والبابليين والاشوريين، فوفقًا لعلماء الاثار فان الكنعانيين هم من اسسها في حدود سنه 2450 قبل الميلاد، وبهذا تعتبر من اقدم مدن العالم التي لا تزال ماهوله بالسكان. كانت تسمى قديمًا عين جانيم وتعني الجنائن، حيث ارتبط اسم المدينه بمرج بن عامر الذي يعتبر اخصب اراضي فلسطين التاريخيه، وفي عهد الرومان كان في بقعتها قريه ذكرت باسم «جيناي» من قرى سَبَسْطيه.\nسيطرت على جنين الكثير من القوى، فكانت تاره تنهض وتاره اخرى تنتكس، الا ان المدينه ازدهرت في اواخر الحكم العثماني وتاسس فيها اول مجلس بلدي في عام 1886. تطورت الحياه في جنين بصوره متسارعه عبر ما يزيد عن القرن بازدياد عدد اللاجئين اليها، حتى بلغت منزلتها المهمه بين المدن الكبرى بالضفه الغربيه في العصر الحديث.\nكان لمدينه جنين شان عظيم في النضال الوطني الفلسطيني منذ بدايه الصراع الفلسطيني الاسرائيلي، وظلت هاجسا بالنسبه لاسرائيل بسبب قربها من مدن الداخل ومشاركه عدد كبير من ابناءها في العمل المسلح ضد اسرائيل، خصوصا بعد الانتفاضه الثانيه.\n\nتسميه\nتقوم مدينه جنين على الارض التي كانت تقوم عليها مدينه «عين جنيم» وتعني بالكنعانيه عين الجنائن. لذلك سُميت بهذا الاسم بسبب الجنائن التي تحيط بها.\nذًُكرت مدينه «عين جنيم» في التوراه على انها احدى المدن التي سكنها اللاويون المنتمين لقبيله «اسحقكر»، والذين غيروا اسمها الى «جنّت» بعد بضع سنوات من استقرارهم بها. وفي كتابات اخرى يُرمز الى المدينه باسم «جيني»، ويذكر المؤرخ اليهودي «يوسيفوس فلافيوس» ان مدينه جنين كانت احدى مدن شمال السامره.\n\nتاريخ\nالعصور القديمه\nتوفرت في موقع جنين المظاهر الطبيعيه اللازمه لاي استقرار بشري، ففيه توفر الماء والسهل والجبل والاوديه والكهوف، وبالتالي وفر هذا الموقع الماء والغذاء والماوى والطريق. وعليه فليس من المستغرب ان يكون الانسان الاول قد اقام في هذا الموقع ولا سيما انه اكتشفت بقايا الانسان الاول في جبل الكرمل القريب من موقع جنين، وفي نفس الوقت ليس هناك ما يحول دون انتقال ذلك الانسان من جبل الكرمل الى جنين. وقبل الميلاد بقرون عديده كانت مدن بيت شان (بيسان) ومجدو ودوثان، وحتى تقوم بين هذه المدن علاقات تجاريه فلا بد من موقع وسطي يقوم بتقديم الخدمات للقوافل التجاريه، وانسب موقع في هذا المجال هو موقع مدينه جنين الذي بقع في وسط المثلث الذي شكله مواقع تلك المدن. ويعزز هذا الراي ورود اسم المدينه في النصوص المصريه القديمه وفي الوثائق البابليه والاشوريه. وقد ورد اسم المدينه في التوراه باسم «عين جنيم» او \"Eun Gannim\" (بالعبريه: ג'נין) اي عين الجنات لكثره مياهها وبساتينها، وكانت تعرف باسم «باب السامره» (سبسطيه الحاليه) لانها تقع عند بدايه الوادي الذي يصل بين مرج ابن عامر وجبال السامره. ونظراً لعدم حصانه موقع عين جانيم انشات في ذلك الوقت «مدينه بلعام» (بلعمه حالياً) التي تقع جنوب جنين ومشرفه على طريق السامره. والمعروف ان جنين الحاليه تقوم على المنطقه التي كانت تقوم عليها مدينه «عين جانيم» العربيه الكنعانيه.\n\nالعهد الفينيقي والاغريقي\nعُثر على 4 مشاعل مصنوعه من الطين النضيج في جنين، وهي ذات اصل فينيقي وتعود للقرن الثامن قبل الميلاد، وكان صاحب هذا الاكتشاف هو عالم الاثار «ج.ا. هاردينغ»، الذي قال بان هذا دليل على وجود نوع من التفاعل والعلاقات التجاريه بين سكان جنين وفينيقيا في ذلك الزمن.\n\nالعهد الروماني\nفي العهد الروماني كانت في مكانها قريه ذكرت باسم «جيناي»، وقد مر بالقرب منها المسيح اكثر من مره وهو في طريقه من الناصره الى القدس. وقد اعتنق سكانها المسيحيه، حيث عثر على بقايا كنيسه بالقرب من مركز جنين، في قريه برقين تحديداً، ويعود تاريخ هذه الكنيسه الى القرن السادس الميلادي. وقد غير الرومان اسمها من «عين جنيم» الى «جنين».\n\nالفتح الاسلامي والصليبيون\nولما جاء الفتح الاسلامي حُرّف اسمها الى «جينين»، وقد قال عنها ياقوت الحموي في معجم البلدان بانها «بليده حسنه بين نابلس وبيسان من ارض الاردن، بها عيون ومياه.» وتعاقبت على حكم المنطقه الدوله الامويه ثم العباسيه. وعندما انحطت هذه الاخيره اخذ يسيطر على فلسطين فئه خارجه عن القانون، مما سهّل على الصليبيين غزوها.\nسقطت مدينه جنين تحت الحكم الصليبي عام 1103م، وقد احتلها دوق ادنبره، ودخلت ضمن اماره بلدوين ومملكه بيت المقدس. وقد غير الصليبيون اسمها الى «غرين الكبرى» (بالفرنسيه: Grand Grin)، تمييزاً لها عن بلده زرعين التي دعوها باسم «غرين الصغرى» (بالفرنسيه: Petit Grin)، وقد احاطها الصليبيون بقلاع وحصون منيعه.\nبقيت جنين بيد الصليبيين حتى عام 1187م، حيث هاجمها صلاح الدين الايوبي اذ استطاع جنده ثقب قلعتها ولكن القلعه سقطت عليهم، وبالتالي غادرها صلاح الدين الى زرعين ومن ثم الى عين جالوت. وبعد معركه حطين سقطت جنين بيد المسلمين، وقد عقد صلاح الدين صلحاً مع اعدائه عام 588 هـ، وبالتالي تركها وغادر بعد ذلك الى بيسان.\nفي عام 1229 عُقد صلح بين فردريك الثاني - امبراطور الامبراطوريه الرومانيه المقدسه والكامل الايوبي خلال الحمله الصليبيه السادسه، اعطيت المدينه بموجبه الى الصليبيين ولكن الملك الصالح ايوب استطاع تحريرها نهائياً عام 1244م في معركه هربيا بمساعده الخوارزميه. وفي عام 1255م تم الاتفاق بين الناصر الايوبي وبين عز الدين ايبك، اول سلاطين المماليك، على اعطائه كل الاراضي التي تقع غرب نهر الاردن (فلسطين حالياً)، وبالتالي دخلت جنين في حوزه المماليك.\n\nالعهد المملوكي والعثماني\nلقد كانت جنين وزرعين احدى اقطاعيات الظاهر بيبرس، في عام 1260 شهدت منطقه عين جالوت الواقعه بالقرب من زرعين، شمال جنين واحده من المعارك الفاصله في التاريخ، حيث تعد معركه عين جالوت من اهم المعارك في تاريخ العالم الاسلامي، انتصر فيها المسلمون المماليك انتصارا ساحقا على المغول وكانت هذه هي المره الاولى التي يهزم فيها المغول في معركه حاسمه منذ عهد جنكيز خان. ادت المعركه لانحسار نفوذ المغول في بلاد الشام وخروجهم منها نهائيا وايقاف المد المغولي المكتسح الذي اسقط الخلافه العباسيه سنه 1258م. وفي عام 1280م ولّى السلطان قلاوون الامير بدر الدين درباس ولايه جنين ومرج ابن عامر. ومن ابرز حوادث جنين في العهد المملوكي، انتشار الوباء في مصر والشام عام 748هـ، ويعود تمكن الوباء من هذه المدينه لانفتاحها على البلدان الاخرى ولكثره الوافدين اليها حيث كانت جنين مركزاً من مراكز البريد بين غزه ودمشق. وقد حكم الامراء الحارثيون - الذين اعلنوا الولاء للعثمانيين - هذه البلاد. وكانت مدينه جنين مركزاً لزعامتهم (من 1601م الى 1671م) حيث خرجت الاماره منهم بعد هذا التاريخ وتولى الاماره احمد باشا الترزي ثم جاء بعده شيوخ المهاميط واشهرهم الشيخ علي من اواخر القرن السابع عشر حتى اوائل القرن الثامن عشر. وفي عام 1566م قامت فاطمه خاتون زوجه والي دمشق ببناء جامع اشتمل على حمام وتكيه وسوق (وهو جامع جنين الكبير حالياً) وقد بقي ال طرباي مسيطرين على المنطقه وموالين للعثمانيين الذين ساعدوهم ضد الامير فخر الدين المعني الثاني - حاكم لبنان - الذي فر الى اوروبا عام 1613م، ولكنه ما لبث ان عاد ثانيه الى المنطقه، وتمكن من هزيمه الطرباي الذين حكموا المنطقه عام 1624م. وفي عام 1660م الحقت جنين مع سنجق اللجون بولايه صيدا.\nفي عام 1799 هاجم الفرنسيون بقياده نابليون فلسطين وعسكر قائده كليبر في مرج ابن عامر، هنا هاجمه جنود الدوله العثمانيه بمساعده اهالي جنين ونابلس، الذين كادوا يقضون على الفرنسيين في تلك المنطقه، لولا ان هبّ نابليون لنجده كليبر، حيث قطع نابليون خط امدادات العثمانيين. ولما انتصر الفرنسيون امر نابليون جنده بحرق جنين ونهبها انتقاماً منهم لمساعدتهم للعثمانيين. وبعد اندحار الفرنسيين ورجوعهم الى مصر نمت مدينه جنين ثانيه واصبحت مركزاً لمتسلميه جنين، يحكمها متسلم ينوب عن والي صيدا وكانت في الغالب لعائلتي ال جرار وال عبد الهادي.\nوكان جبل نابلس في هذه الفتره ينقسم الى متسلميتين: الاولى «متسلميه اللجون» والتي انتقلت فيما بعد الى جنين والثانيه «متسلميه نابلس» واللتان تقعان ضمن سنجق البلقاء (نابلس) التابع لولايه بيروت العثمانيه. وكان ال جرار امراء متسلميه اللجون منذ اوائل القرن الثامن عشر، ففي نهايه هذا القرن قامت الدوله العثمانيه بتعيين الشيخ يوسف الجرار اميراً على اللجون في بلاد حارثه، والذي قام وبمساعده سكان المنطقه والعثمانيين بنجده احمد باشا الجزار حاكم عكا في التصدي للغزو الفرنسي على المدينه.\nثم دخلت جنين كباقي مدن الشام تحت الحكم المصري بعد ان نجح ابراهيم باشا في طرد العثمانيين، وعين حسين عبد الهادي حاكماً لها، كما جعلها مركز لواء خاصاً به، الا ان حكم المصريين لم يدم طويلاً حيث اضطر المصريون للخروج من بلاد الشام عام 1840م. فعادت جنين قائمقاميه في متصرفيه نابلس التابعه لولايه بيروت التي انشئت بدلاً من ولايه صيدا. وفي القرن العشرين ربطت جنين بسكه حديد الحجاز التي وصلتها بالعفوله وبيسان ونابلس، وفي الحرب العالميه الاولى اقام الجيش الالماني مطاراً عسكرياً غرب جنين.\n\nالتاريخ المعاصر\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عهد الانتداب البريطاني اصبحت المدينه مركزاً لقضاء جنين، ولها سجل حافل بالنضال ضد الاستعمار البريطاني والصهيوني، حيث اعلنت اول قوه مسلحه ضد الاستعمار البريطاني عام 1935م بقياده عز الدين القسام، والذي استشهد لاحقاً في احراش بلده يعبد وهي احد البلدات التي تقع غرب مدينه جنين. وقد اشترك سكان المدينه في اضراب عام 1936، وقد تعرضت جنين ابان فتره الانتداب البريطاني الى الكثير من اعمال العنف والتنكيل والتخريب وهدم البيوت على ايدي القوات البريطانيه نتيجه لبعض الحوادث مثل قتل حاكم جنين «موفيت» في عام 1938.\n\nقيام دوله اسرائيل\nاما بعد انسحاب البريطانيين من فلسطين منتصف 1948، وفي خضم [[حرب فلسطين\n1948|الحرب العربيه-الاسرائيليه الاولى]] او النكبه، اختير القائد عبد القادر الحسيني لتولي القياده العسكريه في جبل القدس. ولما تاخر وصول كتاب جيش الانقاذ من الدول العربيه المجاوره حتى اواخر شهر كانون الثاني سنه 1948، قرر الحسيني تعبئه القوى الشعبيه في القسم العربي من التقسيم وقد كان يعتمد على متطوعي جبل نابلس لتاريخ هذا الجبل البطولي والعسكري، ولذا فقد وفد الى مدينه جنين مطلع شهر كانون الثاني وبعد مناقشات ومحادثات مع وجهاء المنطقه، عقدت عده اجتماعات في قرى القضاء وتطوع عدد كبير من المقاتلين واختار الجمع الشيخ فوزي الجرار قائداً لجميع فرق مقاتلي جبل نابلس. وقد اقرت الهيئه العربيه العليا والقياده العسكريه العليا لجامعه الدول العربيه هذا التعيين واعتمدته واوصت ان يتخذ جرار مراكزه في قرى صانور، صير وجبع.\nولقد خاضت جنين بمدنها وقراها معركه الدفاع عن الوجود ضد المنظمات الصهيونيه المسلحه، التي استولت في اواخر مايو سنه 1948 على قرى زرعين، والمزار، ونورس، وصندله، والجلمه، والمقيبله، وفقوعه، وعرانه، وحاولت الاستيلاء على مدينه جنين حيث تم تطويقها في 3 يونيو 1948 وكان عدد الصهاينه 4000 مقاتل؛ فاستولوا على معظم احياء المدينه وتحصن المجاهدون في عماره الشرطه في المدخل الغربي لجنين. حتى وصلت نجده للمحاصرين قوامها 500 جندي عراقي بقياده عمر علي وحوالي 800 من المجاهدين الفلسطينيين من المدينه. وبعد معارك داميه خارج البلده وفي شوارعها وازقتها شارك فيها العديد من سكان المنطقه وقراها المجاوره تقدم العرب لاسترداد قراهم المحيطه بالمدينه. وقد كانت معركه جنين التي وقعت في 3 حزيران سنه 1948 مفخره للمقاتلين من اهل البلاد الذين استشهد منهم العشرات بالاضافه للعدد الكبير من الجرحى، والتي ادت في اخر المطاف الى انسحاب القوات الاسرائيليه من جنين في 4 حزيران سنه 1948 وتكبيدها خسائر جسيمه بلغت 1241 قتيل ومفقود من اصل 4000 جندي اسرائيلي كانوا يحاصرون المدينه. يستذكر الفلسطينيون شهداء الجيش العراقي الذين سقطوا دفاعاً عن جنين، حيث توجد مقبره للعشرات منهم بالقرب من مثلث الشهداء جنوب المدينه.\n\nقيام السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه\nومع باقي الضفه الغربيه دخلت المدينه في عام 1951 في اتحاد مع المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه، واصبحت في عام 1964 مركزاً للواء جنين التابع لمحافظه نابلس. وبقيت تحت الحكم الاردني حتى احتلالها في حرب 1967 او النكسه. رزحت جنين تحت الاحتلال الاسرائيلي واصبحت مركزاً لمنطقه جنين التي يحكمها حاكم عسكري اسرائيلي مباشره. استمر هذا الوضع حتى قدوم السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه عام 1995، واصبحت المدينه منذ ذلك الحين، مركزاً لمحافظه جنين، كما وقعت معظم اراضي المحافظه ضمن تصنيف (ا) و (ب) حسب اتفاق اوسلو.\nفي 3 نيسان من سنه 2002 قامت القوات الاسرائيليه باقتحام جنين ومخيمها في عمليه استمرت 10 ايام متواصله، ارتكبت فيها اسرائيل مجزره راح ضحيتها 58 فلسطيني، فيما تكبدت هي خسائر جسيمه باعداد القتلى حيث ناهزت العشرين قتيل من الجنود الاسرائيليين الذي اشتبكوا في حرب شوارع مع فصائل المقاومه داخل مخيم المدينه في ما اطلق عليها لاحقاً معركه جنين.\n\nحرب غزه (2023)\nخلال حرب غزه، نفذت قوات الاحتلال الاسرائيليه عمليات متعدده في جنين. وفي 22 اكتوبر/تشرين الاول، نفذت القوات الاسرائيليه غاره جويه استهدفت مجمعًا تحت الارض اسفل مسجد الانصار في مخيم جنين للاجئين\nبالمدينه +، ما ادى لاستشهاد اثنين واصيب اخرين بجروح متفاوته، وقيل انها كانت اول غاره جويه في الضفه الغربيه منذ الانتفاضه الثانيه. وادعى الجيش الاسرائيلي ان الضربه استهدفت نشطاء من حماس والجهاد الاسلامي في فلسطين كانوا يخططون ل\"هجوم ارهابي\".\nوتعرضت جنين لاضرار بالغه خلال الحرب على غزه، وبحلول يونيو 2024، ادت الهجمات المتكرره بالقنابل والتوغلات بالجرافات من قبل القوات الاسرائيليه الى تدمير كل شارع وتحويل كل ساحه عامه الى انقاض. وفي حادثه واحده في 21 مايو، وفقًا للصحفي الاسرائيلي جدعون ليفي، اطلق قناص اسرائيلي النار على الماره ما ادى لاستشهادهم، بما في ذلك جراح الدكتور اسيد جبارين (50 عامًا) اثناء توجهه الى العمل في مستشفى جنين الحكومي.\n\nالاهميه الدينيه\nورد اسم جنين بالمخطوطات المصريه القديمه، وكذلك البابليه والاشوريه وفي التوراه والانجيل، وهي مشتقه من الاسم القديم «عين جهانيم» او «جنيم» وهي قريبه من الجنائن والبساتين. وتعتبر جنين خامس الاماكن المقدسه عند المسيحيين، لمرور يسوع المسيح من قريه برقين، حيث اشفى العشره البرص المنعزلين في مغاره بطرف القريه.\nوفي المكان نفسه وفي اوائل القرن الرابع الميلادي اقام قسطنطين الكبير كنيسه برقين المعروفه بكنيسه جرجس وقد قامت الحكومه الهولنديه باجراء الاصلاحات اللازمه لها بالتنسيق مع دائره الاثار في السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه باعتبارها من الاماكن المقدسه لدى النصارى، واصبحت هذه الكنيسه تعتبر طريق الوصل للحجاج المسيحيين من الناصره الى بيت لحم. وفي الفتره المشار اليها اقيمت في جنين كنيسه من ضمن 31 مدينه و442 قريه في عموم اراضي فلسطين، وظلت الكنيسه قائمه الى ان دمرها زلزال عام 560م. كما تضم المحافظه ديراً للاتين يقع في قريه الزبابده ذات الاغلبيه المسيحيه، الواقعه جنوب شرق جنين.\nاما اسلامياً، فيقع في المدينه واحد من اقدم واكبر المعالم الاسلاميه العثمانيه في فلسطين وهو جامع جنين الكبير الذي انشاته فاطمه خاتون ابنه محمد بك بن السلطان الملك الاشرف قانصوه الغوري في القرن السادس عشر. ويُعتبر هذا المسجد من ابرز المعالم التاريخيه في الحضاره الاسلاميه في فلسطين، ومن اقدم التحف المعماريه العثمانيه في البلاد.\n\nالجغرافيه\nالموقع\nتقع مدينه جنين على دائره عرض 32,28 شمالاً وعلى خط طول 35,18 شرق غرينتش، كما تقع على الاحداثيات 208 عرض و178 طول حسب شبكه الاحداثيات الفلسطينيه.\nينقطع في الاجزاء الشماليه من فلسطين استمرار الاقليم الجبلي المحاذي للسهول الساحليه مكوناً سهلاً يشبه مثلثاً متساوي الاضلاع، تمتد قاعدته من سفوح جبل الكرمل في حيفا حتى شرق جنين، ويمتد الضلع الاول من جنوب شرق الناصره وينتهي في جوار مدينه جنين، ويمتد الضلع الثاني بمحاذاه جبال الجليل. ويطلق على السهل اسم مرج ابن عامر. وبالتالي، يمثل موقع مدينه جنين راس مثلث سهل مرج ابن عامر، عند التقاء المرتفعات الممتده من جبل الكرمل ومن جنوب شرق الناصره.\nومما يعطي موقع مدينه جنين اهميه انها تقع في موقع وسطي بالنسبه للمدن الفلسطينيه، حيث تقع جنوب مدينه الناصره على بعد 25 كم، والى الجنوب الشرقي من مدينه حيفا على بعد 50 كم، والى الشمال من مدينه نابلس على بعد 43 كم.\nتقع المدينه على السفح الشمالي لجبال نابلس على الجانب المطل على مرج بن عامر، وتنتشر مساكن المدينه على هذا السفح من ارتفاع يناهز 125م الى ارتفاع يقارب 225م. ويتراوح انحدار هذا السفح بين 10-15 %، مما يشير الى تدرج السفح بشكل تدريجي. وعند قمه السفح تقوم هضبه فسيحه ترتفع تدريجياً نحو الشرق، وتطل باتجاه الشمال على مرج ابن عامر ومن الجنوب الغربي تطل على سهل عرابه الذي يرتفع قرابه 250م، وبالتالي يظهر السفح الذي تقوم عليه المدينه، عتبه بين سهل مرج ابن عامر وبين سهل عرابه.\n\nقرى جنين\nفي محافظه جنين مدينتان، مدينه جنين وقباطيه، ويتبع المحافظه 14 بلديه كبيره (هي يعبد، عرابه، برقين، صانور، سيله الحارثيه، سيله الظهر، الزبابده، اليامون، كفر راعي، كفر دان، ميثلون، دير ابو ضعيف، جبع، عجه، صير)، كما ينتشر عدد ليس بقليل من القرى ومخيم يقع الى الغرب من المدينه، والذي تعرض للاجتياح الاسرائيلي في شهر نيسان عام 2002. كانت جنين تضم قبل نكبه 1948 حوالي (70) قريه كبيره وصغيره وبعد النكبه اقتصرت على ما يقارب 30 قريه صغيره. ومثل باقي المدن الفلسطينيه، تعرضت اراضي شاسعه من جنين وقراها للمصادره من قبل اسرائيل، حيث اقام على ارضها ما يزيد عن 10 مستوطنات.\n\nالمناخ\nيختلف مناخ منطقه جنين عن المناخ العام لفلسطين، وذلك لوضعها الطبوغرافي. فتقع المدينه على ارتفاع يتراوح بين 125 و225 متر، كما تحاط بعدد من المرتفعات، فمن الشرق تحيط بها جبال جلبون ومن الجنوب والغرب والشمال الغربي تحيط بها جبال نابلس وامتدادها في جبل الكرمل، وان انفتاحها على مرج ابن عامر تقفله جبال الجليل على بعد لا يتجاوز 20 كم. هذا الوضع قلل من استفاده المدينه من الرياح الغربيه والجنوبيه الغربيه الماطره والمعدله لدرجه الحراره، كما عمل على ابعاد مناخ جنين عن مناخ البحر الابيض المتوسط، وجعلته اكثر تطرفاً. مثلاً، تتلقى منطقه جنين كميه من الامطار اقل من كميه الامطار التي تتلقاها منطقه يعبد المجاوره بمئه وخمسين مليمترا، وحرارتها اعلى من حراره المنطقه المجاوره.\n\nالسكان\nان نمو عدد السكان في جنين لم يكن بمعدل كبير في الفتره الممتده بين عاميّ 1922 و1931، وذلك بسبب هجره العديد من سكانها الى مدن السهل الساحلي، الا ان هذا النمو بدا يرتفع فيما بعد ليتضاعف عام 1947م؛ بسبب عوده سكان المدينه اليها، وبفعل الركود الاقتصادي الذي اصاب المناطق الساحليه، وبحكم الحرب العالميه الثانيه والاحداث الجاريه في المنطقه. وفي عام 1952 سجل تعداد سكان جنين ارتفاعاً كبيراً بعد تدفق اعداد كبيره من اللاجئين الفلسطينيين عقب نكبه العام 1948، وعاد لينخفض انخفاضاً حاداً عام 1967 بسبب نزوح اعداد كبيره من سكان المدينه الى شرق الاردن ودول الخليج في اعقاب نكسه عام 1967. وفي سنه 1980 عاد عدد السكان للارتفاع بسبب عوده سكان المدينه اليها وما زال يواصل ارتفاعه حتى الان.\nوفقاً لاحصاء عام 2007، فقد بلغ عدد سكان مدينه جنين 39,000 نسمه، من بينهم 19,238 اناث و 19,766 ذكور. كما يبلغ عدد سكان مخيم جنين الذي يقع غرب المدينه 16,000 لاجئ، حسب احصائيات وكاله غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (الاونروا) والتي اشارت الى ان 42.3% من سكان المخيم هم دون سن الخمسه عشر عام، وهذا يعني ان النسبه الكبرى من سكان جنين ومخيمها من الشباب. اما بالنسبه للعدد الاجمالي لسكان محافظه جنين فقد بلغ في عام 2007 حوالي 256,000 نسمه، وهو ما يشكل نسبه 6,8% من تعداد الشعب الفلسطيني داخل الاراضي الفلسطينيه. يُشكل مسلم الغالبيه العظمى من السكان كباقي مناطق الاراضي الفلسطينيه، وتتواجد اقليه المسيحيه في اسرائيل تنتشر في بعض قرى المحافظه وفي جنين نفسها. وهذا جدول باعداد سكان منطقه جنين في سنوات مختلفه:\n\nمخيم جنين\nاسست وكاله الامم المتحده لاغاثه وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (UNRWA) مخيمَ اللاجئين عام 1953 برعايه اردنيه. ويقع المخيم غرب مركز المدينه، ويمتد على مساحه ضيقه لا تتجاوز الكيلومتر المربع، ويعيش فيه كما ذُكر ما يقارب 16,000 لاجئ، مما يجعله بقعه مكتظه سكانياً، وهو امر غير صحي وخصوصًا في ظل النقص الحاد في الخدمات الاساسيه.\n\nكان مخيم جنين هدفا استراتيجيا لقوات الاحتلال الاسرائيلي حيث حاولت استهدافه مرات عده، لكنها فشلت امام مقاومه ابنائه، حيث وجدت قوات الاحتلال صموداً من سكانه الذين اصروا على البقاء داخل المخيم رغم الاضرار الكبيره التي تعرضوا لها، وبلغت الاعتداءات الاسرائيليه على المخيم ذروتها فجر 3 نيسان سنه 2002 حين اقتحمت المخيم واشتبكت مع فصائل المقاومه بحرب شوارع اطلق عليها لاحقاً معركه جنين.\n\nالمواصلات\nكان لموقع جنين اكبر الاثر في حياه المدينه قديماً وحديثاً، ويظهر ذلك في تاريخها الاقتصادي والاجتماعي، وفي اهميتها كعقده مواصلات بين جبال فلسطين الوسطى (نابلس - القدس - الخليل) ومدنها، وبين شمال فلسطين لا سيما طريق القدس - الناصره. كما تتفرع من المدينه طرق الى حيفا وعكا. وقد حظيت مدينه جنين باهتمام بالغ من حيث المواصلات، حيث عُبدت الطرق اليها قبل الطرق الساحليه التي كانت تعتبر اهم الطرق بالنسبه للمستعمرين ايام الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ولم تتوقف اهميه المدينه على الطرق البريه، بل امتدت اهميتها الى الخطوط الحديديه، حيث يمر بها خط يصل الى العفوله ومن ثم بيسان فطبريا.\nتعدّ مدينه جنين من المدن الفلسطينيه التي نشات قديمِاً وتطورت عمرانيًا وذلك نتيجه للتزايد السكاني، ولكن لم تتطور شبكه المواصلات فيها بشكل مواز، ويعود ذلك لفترات الاحتلال المتعاقبه والتي مرت بها المدينه، والظروف الاقتصاديه والاجتماعيه الناجمه، مما ادى الى ظهور العديد من المشاكل في نظاِم المواصلات سواءً على مستوى تخطيط وتنظيم الطرقات والشوارع، او على مستوى البنيه الانشائيه للطرق.\n\nتاتي اهميه مدينه جنين من حيث نوع الخدمات التي تقدمها والمؤسسات الموجودهِ فيها، والتي تتضمن مكاتب حكوميه ومدارس، ومستشفيات، وبنوك، واسواق، ومحلات تجاريه ومنطقه صناعيه، والتي تقدم خدمات للقرى والبلدات في المحافظه. اضافه لذلك، فان اهميه المدينه تعود الى الطرق الاقليميه والتي تم تخطيطها من قبل وزاره التخطيط والتي تمر عبر مدينه جنين، فالطريق الاولى من وادي الاردن الى الناصره، والاخرى تربط الخليل بحيفا وتمر عبر مدينتي نابلس ورام الله، وتاتي اهميه المدينه ايضا بسبب قربها من الخط الاخضر الوهمي الذي يفصل مناطق عام 1948 عن المناطق المحتله عام 1967، حيث تشكل مركزا للتسوق للفلسطينيين داخل الخط الاخضر.\nوتزداد اهميه النقل في مدينه جنين وذلك نتيجه للتوسع المدينه ونموها المتسارع. ويستخدم سكان المدينه في تنقلهم داخل المدينه وسائل نقل مختلفه. الا انه تبين من المسح الميداني عام 2007، ان هناك انخفاض في استخدام السيارات الخاصه في المدينه، حيث بلغت نسبه الاسر التي تمتلك سياره خاصه 13.8% من مجموع الاسر بالمدينه. في مقابل ذلك يلاحظ ارتفاع في استخدام سيارات الاجره وخاصه للتنقل بين مركز المدينه ومناطقها المختلفه، حيث بلغت نسبه مستخدمي هذه الوسيله 43.9%، وبنسبه اقل للحافلات تبلغ 25.3% من مجموع السكان.\nتتكون الشبكه الحاليه للطرق في مدينه جنين من مجموعه من الممرات الرئيسيه، التي يتراوح عرضها من اربع مسارب الى مسربين، تربط اجزاء المدينه ببعضها، كما تربطها بمدن فلسطينيه اخرى، بالاضافه لقرى محافظه جنين، وهذه الطرق هي:\n\nالاقتصاد\nمدينه جنين احدى المدن الرئيسيه في فلسطين، بالرغم من قله عدد سكانها تاريخياً حتى النكبه، مقارنه بالمدن الفلسطينيه الاخرى، الا ان لها ثقلاً اقتصادياً يفوق حجمها السكاني بشده، وهذا يعود لتمتع المحافظه بخصائص طبيعيه متنوعه وفرت لها موارد اقتصاديه متنوعه لا سيما في مجال التعليم والخدمات والمهن والحرف، مما مكن ابناءها من ايجاد فرص عمل في الدول العربيه المجاوره، وهذا بدوره خفض من اثر المدينه بالمساهمه الفعاله بالحجم السكاني في الضفه الغربيه، ولكنه اتاح الفرصه لرفع معدلات حوالات المغتربين للمدينه والمحافظه بشكل كبير مما اثر على اقتصاد المدينه والبلاد بشكل ايجابي. تدير غرفه تجاره وصناعه وزراعه لواء جنين الاوضاع الاقتصاديه في المدينه.\n\nالتجاره\nوتنتشر الاسواق في مدينه جنين: فهناك السوق الشعبي، سوق الحلال، سوق الجمله، سوق السيباط، سوق شارع الناصره، سوق شارع ابو بكر، سوق شارع بورسعيد، سوق شارع فيصل، سوق شارع الهلال، سوق شارع فاطمه خاتون، وسوق الحسبه القديمه. وتحتوي الاسواق المذكوره على العديد من المحلات التجاريه المختلفه. بالاضافه الى سوق تجاري رئيس يقع وسط المدينه واخر يقع شمال المدينه مخصص لاستقبال المتسوقين الفلسطينيين داخل الخط الاخضر الذين يشكلون 85% من القوه الشرائيه حسب تقديرات الغرفه التجاريه والصناعيه في جنين.\n\nالزراعه\nتعتبر الزراعه نشاطاً رئيسياً في مدينه جنين ومحافظتها، حيث يعتمد عليها غالبيه السكان سواء كان ذلك بصوره مباشره او غير مباشره. وقبل هجره بعض سكانها الى دول الخليج في ستينات القرن العشرين، كانت الزراعه هي المورد الوحيد في المنطقه. وتعد مدينه جنين زراعيه لحد كبير اذ تشكل مركز التسويق والتمويل الزراعي للمحافظه، حيث تعد اراضيها الزراعيه واحده من اكثر المناطق خصوبه في الضفه الغربيه، حيث تزرع سنوياً بالمحاصيل الحقليه والخضار والاشجار المثمره كالزيتون واللوزيات والحمضيات، بالاضافه الى استخدام البيوت البلاستيكيه على نطاق واسع. كما تشتهر المحافظه منذ عقود بزراعه فاكهه البطيخ بشكل لافت. قدرت وزاره الزراعه الفلسطينيه مساحه الارض المزروعه في المحافظه عام 1998/1997، حوالي 367,415 دونم وهو ما يعادل حوالي 20% من مساحه الارض المزروعه في الاراضي الفلسطينيه.\nتتمتع منطقه جنين وطوباس بثروه حرجيه تميزها على باقي محافظات السلطه الفلسطينيه، وتنتشر الغابات على مساحه تقارب 270,000 دونم، تشكل حوالي 85% من احراش الضفه الغربيه، الا انها تقع في الغالب في التصنيف (ج) حسب اتفاق اوسلو.\n\nالصناعه\nبدا اقتصاد المدينه يتحول تدريجياً الى الصناعه بعد قدوم السلطه الفلسطينيه في منتصف تسعينات القرن الفائت، وبالاخص الصناعات الخفيفه والمتوسطه، حيث ستنشا منطقه صناعيه دوليه من اجل تفعيل الحركه الاقتصاديه وتنشيطها، وايجاد فرص عمل لعدد كبير من اهالي المنطقه، وجعل جنين همزه وصل بين عرب الداخل وباقي مناطق السلطه الفلسطينيه. ويمكن اجمال هذه الصناعات بالتالي: صناعات زراعيه، وتشمل معاصر الزيتون والمطاحن؛ وصناعات خاصه بالبناء وتشمل المقالع والمحاجر والكسارات وصناعه البلاط والفسيفساء؛ وصناعه الملابس والاحذيه والخشب والحديد.\nفي عام 2008، افتتح مهرجان للصناعات الوطنيه الفلسطينيه في القريه السياحيه شرق جنين، برعايه السلطه الفلسطينيه وبدعم اوروبي، وكان لذلك شان كبير في تقدم المشاريع الاقتصاديه وتحقيق النمو الاقتصادي في المحافظه والاراضي الفلسطينيه بصوره عامه.\n\nالعماره\nتعتبر مدينه جنين مدينه سكنيه الى حد كبير، بالاضافه لكونها مركز تجاري وزراعي، الا ان طابع المنازل والبنايات السكنيه يغلب عليها، ويختلف حجم البناء ومساحه المساكن بالنسبه للمدينه عنه في المدن الفلسطينيه الاخرى، فبلغ متوسط عدد الغرف فيها 4.5 غرفه لعام 2007، بينما المعدل العام في المدن الفلسطينيه هو 3.6 غرفه، وقد يعود هذا الى عدد من العوامل منها العادات والتقاليد، حيث ان البناء حجمه وشكله ومادته كلها تعزز القيمه الاجتماعيه للاسره. ويظهر ذلك بوضوح عند الذين تركوا الارياف ثم انتقلوا الى السكن في مدينه جنين، كما للدخل دور في عدد الغرف بالمسكن.\nوتتوفر في محافظه جنين مناطق متعدده يتم استخراج حجاره البناء منها ومن هذه المناطق قباطيا وعجه وغيرها، مما دفع الكثير من السكان لاستخدام الحجاره في بناء مساكنهم بنسبه عاليه. ويستخدم الطوب ايضا بنسبه كبيره - خاصه بمخيم المدينه، كما تستخدم الدكه والطين بنسب اقل. ان نسبه المساكن المبنيه من الحجر بلغت 40.5% من مساكن المدينه، وهي نسبه مقاربه للنسبه العامه لمدن الضفه الغربيه والتي هي 40% حسب احصاء سنه 1997.\n\nالتعليم\nتحتل محافظه جنين مرتبه متقدمه في نسب التعليم بالاراضي الفلسطينيه، وهي الاولى على مستوى الضفه الغربيه، حيث تشاطر النسبه ذاتها تقريباً كل من سلفيت وطولكرم - وتبلغ نسبه الاميه في محافظه جنين 3,9% من الذين هم اكبر من 10 سنوات، بينما المعدل العام في الاراضي الفلسطينيه هو 5,8% (وهو كما معروف من اقل النسب عربياً).\nعرفت المدينه حركه تعليميه منذ امد بعيد، حيث كان نظام (الكتاتيب) سائداً منذ بدايه القرن التاسع عشر. وقد شهدت مساجد المدينه الحلقات التدريسيه والمناظرات العلميه من قبل مشاهير العلماء المسلمين، وغلب على هذه الحركه العلميه الطابع الديني حيث كانت تدرس علوم الدين المختلفه من فقه وحديث.\nوفي نهايه القرن التاسع عشر اقيمت اول مدرسه ابتدائيه ضمت اربعه صفوف، ثم تبع انشاء المدرسه الابتدائيه اخرى علياً. وبقي الامر كذلك حتى بعد الانتداب البريطاني، لان البريطانيين لم يكونوا معنيين بتطور الخدمات العامه لا سيما الخدمات التعليميه. وفي عام 1943 ارتفعت معدلات التضخم في البلاد بشكل حاد، وهذا دفع الاستعمار البريطاني للقيام ببعض الخدمات لامتصاص الفائض النقدي في البلاد، فانشا في مدينه جنين مدرسه ثانويه، دفع الاهالي تكاليفها بالكامل. ومن الامور التي ساهمت فعلاً في تطوير الحركه العلميه في المدينه تشكيل لجنه المعارف المحليه التي كانت مهمتها البحث في الموارد والمصادر الماليه التي يمكن عن طريقها تطوير التعليم في المدينه.\n\nوبعد حرب سنه 1948 لم يكن في المدينه سوى مدرستين، واحده للذكور واخرى للاناث. وبعد تولي الحكومه الاردنيه زاد عدد المدارس وتضاعف عدد الطلاب.\nوفي عام 1982 بلغ عدد المدارس في مدينه جنين احدى عشره مدرسه للذكور وست مدراس للاناث، وبلغ عدد الطلاب في هذه السنه 2610 طالباً و2495 طالبه ومما تجدر الاشاره اليه هو ان عدد الطلاب الذكور في هذه السنه لم يتجاوز عدد الطلاب عام 1960. هذا يشير الى ظاهره الهجره من المدينه في الفتره التي تلت حرب سنه 1967، اما من حيث الطالبات فقد تضاعف عددهن تقريباً بين هاتين السنتين.\nانشات الحكومه الاردنيه في عام 1965 مديريه التربيه والتعليم في جنين لتشرف على 65 مدرسه موزعه بين الذكور والاناث في التجمعات السكانيه المختلفه التابعه للواء جنين انذاك ويعمل بها 508 معلمه ومعلم. في عام 2005 بلغ عدد المدارس التابعه للمديريه 110 مدارس، وعدد الطلبه 37,531 طالب وطالبه وعدد المعلمين 1,852 معلم ومعلمه.\nاما على صعيد التعليم العالي، فقد شهدت جنين طفرهً كبيرهً في اعداد حَمَله شهادات البكالوريوس والماجستير في كثير من التخصصات سواء في الضفه الغربيه او في الخارج. ويتبع تنظيم محافظه جنين اليوم جامعه خاصه هي الجامعه العربيه الامريكيه - جنين وفرع لجامعه القدس المفتوحه، والتي لا تقتصر خدماتها التعليميه على سكان محافظه جنين فقط، بل تمتد هذه الخدمات لتشمل القرى وبعض المدن المحيطه بها.\n\nالثقافه\nشكلت الثقافه جزءً من هويه سكان منطقه جنين منذ زمن بعيد، والتي كانت في الاغلب ثقافه تعبر عن الريف الفلسطيني، وهذا يظهر بشكل واضح في اللكنه او اللهجه التي تميز سكان هذه المنطقه عن باقي اللهجات الفلسطينيه بقلب القاف الى كاف، كذلك هو الحال بالنسبه للزي التقليدي الذي تميز في منطقه جنين وشمال الضفه الغربيه عن غيره من الازياء الفلسطينيه الاخرى ببساطته ولونه الابيض المقلم طولياً. كذلك يظهر التاثير الريفي في المطبخ الفلسطيني لهذا الجزء من فلسطين والذي يشتهر بطبق المسخن الشعبي، الذي يعتبر في نفس الوقت من الاكلات الوطنيه في المطبخ الفلسطيني.\nتحوي جنين وقراها عدداً كبيراً من المعالم الثقافيه البارزه على مستوى الضفه الغربيه، لكنها في الغالب اما ان تكون قد عانت او تضررت بسبب الاحتلال الاسرائيلي. فقد تم في عام 2009 العمل على اعاده

          "content": "Tulkarm or Tulkarem (Arabic: طولكرم, Ṭūlkarm) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine and the capital of the Tulkarm Governorate. Netanya is to the west in Israel, while Nablus and Jenin are to the east. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2017 Tulkarm had a population of 64,532. Tulkarm is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority.\n\nEtymology\nThe Arabic name translates as 'length of vinyard' but is a distortion of the Aramaic name Tur Karma ('mount of the vineyard'), which was used for Tulkarm by the Crusaders and by the mediaeval Samaritan inhabitants.\n\nHistory\nDuring the Ayyubid era, after the Muslim reconquest of Palestine under Sultan Saladin in 1187, the first families to settle in Tulkarm were from the Kurdish clan of Zaydan. A military group, the Zaydan were dispatched to the Wadi al-Sha'ir area, which includes Tulkarm, by Saladin to buttress the defense of the western approaches of Muslim-held Palestine from the Crusaders who dominated the coastal area.\nThe Zaydan politically dominated Tulkarm and the vicinity until the early 17th century. Around 1230, during the late Ayyubid period, a group of Arabs from southern Palestine immigrated to Tulkarm. They had originally migrated to Palestine from Arabia many generations prior and had become semi-nomadic farmers and grazers. Among the Arab families were the Fuqaha clan, who were considered ashraf (related to the Islamic prophet Muhammad) and served as the ulama (religious scholars) of the village.\nDuring the Ayyubid, and later the Mamluk era (1260–1517), the majority of Tulkarm's lands were made part of a waqf (religious trust) to support the al-Farisiyya Madrasa, an Islamic religious school in Jerusalem, located north of the Masjid Al-Aqsa compound. Two-thirds of the village's farmlands were confirmed as part of this trust in 1354 by the deputy-governor of Damascus, Faris al-Din al-Baki. During Mamluk rule another wave of Arab immigrants arrived in Tulkarm from North Africa and nearby Nablus. They largely engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry, supplying hides to leather merchants in the coastal villages, retaken from the Crusaders in the second half of the 13th century.\n\nOttoman era\nTulkarm was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Afterward, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520–66) transferred Tulkarm's waqf to the al-Jawhariyya Madrasa (Commons), located in the Muslim Quarter, northwest of the al-Aqsa Mosque. Under this arrangement, Tulkarm's inhabitants paid a third of their harvest as a tax towards the waqf, called qasm. At the time of the waqf's reassignment, the population of the village was estimated at 522 (95 households) and the qasm consisted of eight carats of wheat and three carats of barley. The town's elite families administered the trust, which enabled them to reach higher social and economic status. The population increased through intermarriage with families fleeing violent feuds between the various clans of Jabal Nablus. By 1548, the population had grown to 189 households or roughly 1,040 persons.\nTulkarm appeared in Ottoman tax registers in 1596 as being in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Qaqun, which was a part of the sanjak (district) of Nablus. The largest village in the nahiya, Tulkarm had a population of 176 Muslim households (roughly 968 persons) and paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, goats, beehives and a press for olives or grapes. During this early period of Ottoman rule, there were five neighborhoods (pl. harat) centered around the Shaykh Ali al-Jazri al-Mughrabi Mosque, today referred to simply as the \"Old Mosque\". The population was overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim, and most residents were fellahin (peasants who worked the land.) The elite families during that time were the Zaydan and the Lajjun-based Tarabay, the latter belonging to the Bani Harith tribe. Because of the decentralized nature of the Ottoman state, these families and their successors in later centuries ruled the area with a high degree of autonomy. The Zaydan had particular authority over Tulkarm, being appointed as the mutassalim (tax collectors or enforcers) on behalf of the central authorities.\nIn the mid-17th-century most members of the Zaydan family, with the exception of the children and the elderly, were killed in a massacre by Tulkarm's inhabitants during Friday prayers. This was in reaction to the Zaydan having forced Tulkarm's residents to harvest and process the village's grains for taxation purposes. Consequently, political power in Tulkarm passed to the Badran clan, while the Fuqaha family took control of administering the \"waqf\" lands, firmly establishing them as the village's religious leaders. The Fuqaha had derived much of their authority from their classification as ashraf and their association with the Sufi Rifa'iyya zawiya of the village. The western neighborhood was mostly emptied of Zaydan members and would serve as the main area of settlement for newcomers.\nTulkarm appears on sheet 45 of Pierre Jacotin's map drawn up during Napoleon's invasion in 1799, named Toun Karin.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Ottoman Land Code in 1858, the musha (collective landownership) system was gradually abrogated and residents were required to register their property with the central authorities. The fellahin were wary of registering their names for fear of military conscription by the Ottoman state and instead entrusted various elite clans with the role of landlords, who were in effect absentee owners. This altered the area's social structure, with the Samara, al-Hajj Ibrahim and Hanun clans legally obtaining vast swathes of Tulkarm's lands. Leadership of the town's two main religious establishments were generally supplied by the Kur-based Jayyusi clan and the al-Barqawi clan of Shufa. The Barqawi clan controlled the area around the town in the 19th century.\nThe 1860s French explorer Victor Guérin visited Tulkarm, which he described as being of \"considerable\" size, with about 1,000 inhabitants. During this time, the Ottoman authorities granted the village an agricultural plot of land called Ghabat Tulkarm in the former confines of the Forest of Arsur (Ar. Al-Ghaba) in the coastal plain, west of the village.\n\nThe Survey of Western Palestine in 1882 described Tulkarm as a \"long straggling village, on high ground\", surrounded by arable land and rock. There were several \"good-sized\" houses, mainly of stone in the village.\nTulkarm became the administrative center of a new subdistrict (qada') Bani Saʿb-Tulkarm in 1876, later becoming a municipality in 1892. Tulkarm was also appointed a governor, bringing the residents who numbered only a few thousand and who were mostly fellahin, closer to the central government. This elevated status gave Tulkarm precedence over the nearby villages, which at that time also included Qalqilya. Tulkarm's center shifted from the Old Mosque to an empty space in the northwest as the town expanded northward with the construction of government buildings, a post office, a school and a hospital in that area.\nAround the turn of the 20th century, Tulkarm was one of the villages in which the Hannun family owned extensive estates. The Hannuns fostered close ties with clans in the village.\nTulkarm became a major rail junction in 1908 on the Hejaz Railway line running up from Egypt and southern Palestine to Haifa and Acre in the northwest, Jerusalem, Nablus and Ramallah to the south, Lebanon to the north, and Syria and Transjordan to the east. The Ottoman Army used Tulkarm as one of its principal bases during the Sinai and Palestine campaign in World War I. It was bombed by British planes carried by HMS Anne. It was captured by British forces in 1918.\n\nBritish Mandate era\nThe British Mandatory administration (1942–1947) in Palestine designated Tulkarm as the center of the Tulkarm Subdistrict.\nA road was constructed in 1920 to connect the town with Netanya on the coast. In order to cope with a significant increase in population and unorganized infrastructural development, a civil planning scheme was designed for Tulkarm and its satellite villages in 1945. At the time Tulkarm was divided into four main sections, with the bulk of commercial activity concentrated along the north–south and east–west roads. Meanwhile, the town continued to expand past its northern fringes, which had previously been characterized by green spaces.\nTulkarm became a haven for Palestinian Arab rebel activity during the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine against British rule. General Commander of the Revolt Abd al-Rahim al-Hajj Muhammad hailed from Dhinnaba, today part of Tulkarm municipality, and led many operations in the region.\nIn the 1945 statistics the population of Tulkarm consisted of 8,090; of whom 7,790 were Muslims, 280 Christian and 20 \"other\", with a land area of 1,672 dunams (urban) and 32,610 dunams (rural), according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 2,399 dunams were designated for citrus and bananas, 276 plantations and irrigable land, 28,256 for cereals, while 1,492 dunams were built-up areas.\n\nJordanian rule\nDuring the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Tulkarm was occupied by the Iraqi Army and later annexed as part of the Jordanian-held West Bank. The 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and Jordan left roughly 30,000 dunams of Tulkarm's 32,610 dunams of land, mostly agricultural, in Israeli territory. In consequence, many residents moved to Transjordan or went abroad in search of employment. Straddling the armistice line, Tulkarm was cut off from nearby Arab towns. Its principal economic and social connection was with Nablus.\nIn 1950, the Tulkarm Camp was established by UNRWA in the city, comprising an area of 0.18 square kilometres (0.07 sq mi). Most of the refugees who resided in the camp came from Jaffa, Caesarea and Haifa. Today it is the second largest Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank. A period of significant municipal expansion began in Tulkarm after a new civil development scheme was authorized in 1961. As part of this plan, in 1963, the hamlet of Jarrad in the southeast and other lands in the northeast (total of 1.8 square km) were annexed to the city, while the eastern village of Dhinnaba was incorporated into the municipality in 1964, adding another 0.75 square kilometres (0.29 sq mi) of territory. The village of Shuweika to the north and the smaller village of Irtah to the south were annexed in 1967.\n\nContemporary period\nSince the Six-Day War in 1967, Tulkarm has been under Israeli occupation. A military government governed Tulkarm until transfer in 1982 to the Israeli Civil Administration.\nDuring the early months of the First Intifada, 16 May 1989, Muhammad As'ad Fokhah, 50 years old, from Shuweika, died in Megiddo prison after a three-day hunger strike. Yitzhak Rabin reported to a Member of Knesset that Fokhah died of a heart attack caused by dehydration and that the military investigation found that prison staff had acted in accordance with orders.\nIn the wake of the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), control of Tulkarm was transferred to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on 10 December 1995, becoming the third Palestinian city from which Israeli forces withdrew. During the early years of the Second Intifada, Israel temporarily reoccupied Tulkarm. Israeli military administration over Tulkarm ended in 2005, when control of the city was handed back to the PNA. Upon assuming control of the city, the PNA instituted new weapons restrictions limiting militants to a single registered weapon that may not be loaded or carried in public.\n\nGaza War\nOn 19 October 2023, the IDF entered the city. In August 2024, Israeli bulldozers destroyed miles of the city, including homes, businesses and infrastructure; Israeli soldiers blocked emergency responders from assisting residents. News reports include videos of this attack, as well as assertions by the Israel Defense Forces that it is rooting out terrorism; and that it \"undertakes all feasible precautions to avoid damaging essential infrastructure,\" while acknowledging that these \"operations in the area have caused unavoidable harm to certain civilian structures.\"\n\nGeography\nThe city is situated on the western edge of northern West Bank, about 15 kilometers (9.3 mi) west of Nablus further southwest of Jenin and 15 kilometers (9.3 mi) east of the Israeli coastal city of Netanya. It is bordered by the 1948 ceasefire line, with Israel's Central and Haifa Districts to the west, and Palestine's Qalqilya and Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorates to the south. Its central location between a plain and a mountain has made it commercially and strategically significant and has had a great impact on its growth. In the past, Tulkarm was a caravan station and a trading center for products from the city's surrounding villages and farms, as well as a point from which armies crossed to Egypt and the Levant (al-Sham).\nTulkarm is at the crossroads of three historically important arteries: A road which runs north from the Latrun area along the edge of the coastal plain to Mount Carmel, Mount Tabor, Mount Gilboa, Nazareth and the Galilee and the Golan Heights, a road which winds northward along the outer tier of hills from the Ajalon valley to the Jezreel Valley, and a road that rises from the Mediterranean Sea at modern-day Netanya east to Nablus. In the past it was a junction of the coastal railroad from north of Haifa to Cairo and a branch of the narrow gauge Hejaz railway to Damascus.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Tulkarm had a population of 3,350 (3,109 Muslims, 208 Christians, 23 Jews, eight Samaritans, one Baha'i, and one Druze). At the time of the 1931 census, Tulkarm had a population of 4,827 (4,540 Muslims, 255 Christians, 18 Jews, six Samaritans, and one Druze) with 541 in nearby suburbs (516 Muslims, 15 Jews, and 10 Christians).\nThe village statistics of 1938 list Tulkarm's population as 5,700 with 629 in nearby suburbs (including 17 Jews). The village statistics of 1945 list the population as 8,090 (7,790 Muslims, 280 Christians, and 20 \"other\").\nThe populations of Tulkarm, Dhinnaba, Shuweika and Irtah steadily increased by an average of 2% annually between 1931 and 1961, with a drastic increase after the 1948 War as the area experienced an influx of Palestinian refugees. The Jews presumably left/fled during the war. Following the 1967 War, the population saw a temporary decrease as some residents fled to Jordan. In the 1967 census by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics the population of Tulkarm city was recorded as 10,255, Tulkarm Camp as 5,020, Dhinnaba as 1,342, Irtah as 925, Shuweika as 2,332 and Khirbet Jarrad as 128, a total of 20,002. Most of the inhabitants were Muslims, although there was a community of 103 Christians according to the census.\nIn the first census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) in 1997, Tulkarm had a population of 33,921 and the Tulkarm Refugee Camp had a population of 5,884. Palestinian refugees made up 31.4% of the city's residents and 94% of the camp's inhabitants. The sex ratio for the city was 50.7% male and 49.3% female. Over half (52.2%) of the city's population was under the age of 20, 44.5% were between the ages of 20 and 64 and 4.1% were over the age of 64. In the 2007 PCBS census Tulkarm's population grew to 51,300 while the camp's increased to 10,641. The sex ratio for the city was 50.3% male and 49.7% female.\n\nToday the population is almost entirely Muslim. Prior to Israel's occupation of the city in 1967, there were an estimated 1,000 Christians living in Tulkarm, but roughly half of the community emigrated in the aftermath of the war, while most of the remaining Christians gradually emigrated afterward. There are two Christian families who continue to live in Tulkarm, who are part of the same extended family. There is a Greek Orthodox church in the city dedicated to St. George, built in the early 19th century. The church is active and opens for visitors.\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Tulkarm is Mediterranean and subtropical as the area surrounding it, with rainfall limited to the winter. The average temperature in the winter ranges from 8 to 16 °C (46 to 61 °F), while the average temperature in the summer ranges from 17 to 30 °C (63 to 86 °F). Tulkarm is distinguished by the moderating effect the sea breeze has on its climate because of its location in the mountains. The average temperature does not exceed 27 °C (81 °F) in August, while February's average temperature does not fall below 13.5 °C (56 °F). Humidity is moderate in summer, about 40-70%, though it rises in winter to between 70 and 85%. Tulkarm receives in excess of 550 millimeters (22 in) of rain yearly, which is dispersed and intermittent, characteristic of the Mediterranean Basin.\n\nThe rainy season starts in October and continues through May. Between December and February, almost 70% of annual rainfall occurs, while 20% of annual rainfall occurs in October and November. Rain in June and September is rare and comes to negligible amounts. July and August have no rain at all, except for one rainfall of 1.5 millimeters (0.059 in) on July 10, 1995, in Tulkarm city (Tulkarm Agricultural Department). The mean annual rainfall in the city of Tulkarm is 642 millimeters (25.3 in) for the period from 1952 to 1995 (Tulkarm Agricultural Department).\n\nEconomy\nPrior to the 1948 War, Tulkarm had a major agricultural sector, with grain, olives and fruits, especially watermelons, being the major crops cultivated by in the town's lands.\n\nEducation\nPalestinian Technical University - Kadoorie which is the sole governmental university in Palestine, was established as an agricultural college in Tulkarem during the British Mandate by an endowment from the Iraqi-born Jewish philanthropist J.S. Kadoorie in 1930 and then became a university in 2007. Other institutions of higher learning include Al-Quds Open University and two campuses of An-Najah National University.\nThere are seven high schools in Tulkarm, three for girls (al-Adawiah, Jamal Abd al-Nasser, and Al-Khawaja) and three for boys (al-Fadilia, Ihsan Samara, and Adnan Sefareni) and a vocational school for both genders.\n\nOn September 24, 2016, the PA named a school in Tulkarem after Salah Khalaf. Tulkarem governor Issam Abu Bakr said that the school was named after “martyr Salah Khalaf in order to commemorate the memory of this great national fighter”.\n\nCulture\nThe traditional costumes of women from Tulkarm were plain, dark-colored gowns with or without embroidery, as most rural women were from the north of Palestine. Today, embroidery is the main source of income for the women of the city. The most popular embroidered images are maps of historic Palestine. The Palestinian dish musakhan is popular in the city. Tulkarm shares many of its cultural features with neighboring Haifa, Jenin, Nablus, Qalqilia, and Jaffa.\nA Tulkarm amusement park called Mega Land attracts tens of thousands of visitors on Muslim holidays.\n\nSports\nTulkarm has 2 semi-professional soccer teams; Thaqafi Tulkarm and Markez Shabab Tulkarm. Both are in the Palestinian League Division One.\n\nSister cities\nTulkarm's sister cities include:\n\n Cenon, France\n Nîmes, France\n Meknes, Morocco\n Santarém, Portugal\n\nNotable people\nSanaa Alsarghali\nAbu Salma (1909–1980)\nAkram Al-Ashqar, film maker\nEkrem Akurgal, Turkish archaeologist born in 1911 in Tulkarm\nKhaled Abu Toameh, Palestinian Israeli-Arab Muslim journalist\nMar'i al-Karmi (1580–1624)\nMahmoud Al-Karmi (1889–1939)\nHasan Karmi (1905–2007)\nAbdul-Ghani Al-Karmi (1906–1974)\nHilmi Hanoun (1913–2001), long-term mayor of Tulkarm\nZuhair Al-Karmi (1921–2009)\nAmeen Nayfeh, film maker and writer\nBassam Lotfi (1940-2022)\nAlaa Shreiteh (1979–2024)\n\nSee also\nTulkarm Brigade\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nWelcome To Tulkarm R.C.\nTulkarem City, Welcome to Palestine\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 11: IAA, Wikimedia commons\nAl-Salim, Farid.

The city had a population of 51,683 in 2017. Qalqilya is surrounded by the Israeli West Bank wall, with a narrow gap in the east controlled by the Israeli military and a tunnel to the Palestinian town of Hableh. Qalqilya is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority (as part of Area A), while remaining under Israeli military occupation.\n\nEtymology\nAccording to Edward Henry Palmer, the name came from \"a type of pomegranate\", or \"gurgling of water\". Qalqilya was known as Calecailes in the Roman period, and Calcelie in the Frankish sources from the early Medieval times. The word \"Qalqilya\" might be derived from a Canaanite term which means \"rounded stones or hills\".\n\nHistory\nThe vicinity of Qalqilya has been populated since prehistoric times, as attested to by the discovery of prehistoric flint tools.\n\nOttoman period\nQalqilya appeared in Ottoman tax registers (transliterated as Qalqili) in 1596, as a village in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Bani Sa'b in the Liwa of Nablus. It paid a total of 3,910 akçe in taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, and goats or beehives.\nEdward Robinson described Kulakilieh in 1838 as a village in Beni Sa'ab district, west of Nablus. An Ottoman census listed the village in the nahiya (sub-district) of Bani Sa'b, in 1288 AH (1871/1872 CE).\nQalqilya was described in 1882 as \"a large somewhat straggling village, with cisterns to the north and a pool on the south-west. The houses are badly built.\" Residents from nearby Baqat al-Hatab move to the city in 1883, and a municipal council to administer Qalqilya was established in 1909.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nAn official land survey recorded 27,915 dunams of land owned in 1945. Of this, 3701 dunams were for citrus and bananas, 3,232 were plantations and irrigable land, 16,197 used for cereals, while 273 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\nAccording to Sami Hadawi, the town had been \"one of the most prosperous in Palestine, owning extensive orange groves and serving as one of the main vegetable markets of the country.\"\n\n1948 War\nDuring the war, many inhabitants from  Kafr Saba, Abu Kishk, Miska, Biyar 'Adas and Shaykh Muwannis resettled in Qalqilya. Residents of Qalqilya who left during the fighting returned with the arrival of the Jordanian Arab Legion and the Iraqi expeditionary force, apart from 2,000 upper-class residents who settled in Nablus for economic reasons. Hadawi argues that the armistice lines established in 1949 \"severed all [Qalqilya's] orange groves in favour of Israel,\" leaving the town \"landless except for its rocky areas towards the east.\"\n\nJordanian occupation\nAfter the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and the 1949 Armistice Agreements, the area was occupied by Jordan in 1950. On the night of 10 October 1956, the Israeli army launched a raid against Qalqilya police station in response to a Jordanian attack on Israeli bus, among other incidents. The attack was ordered by Moshe Dayan and involved several thousand soldiers. During the fighting, a paratroop company was surrounded by Jordanian troops and escaped under close air-cover from four Israeli Air Force aircraft. Eighteen Israelis and 70 to 90 Jordanians were killed in the operation.\n\nPost 1967\nIn the wake of the Six-Day War in 1967, Qalqilya came under Israeli rule. Dozens of inhabitants were expelled to Jordan as part of the Palestinian expulsions of 1967 known as the Naksa. 850 buildings were razed. After the IDF's psychological warfare unit made a visit to the city and many of the residents had fled, the UN representative Nils-Göran Gussing  noted that 850 of the town's 2,000 houses were demolished. In his memoirs, Moshe Dayan wrote that these actions ultimately constituted \"collective punishment\" which was contrary to  government policy. The villagers were eventually allowed to return and the reconstruction of damaged houses was financed by the military authorities.\nAs part of the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), control of Qalqilya was transferred to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on 17 December 1995.\nIn 2003, the Israeli West Bank barrier was built, encircling the town and separating it from agricultural lands on the other side of the wall.\nIn November 2015, Israel arrested what it alleged to be a network of 24 Hamas militants active in the city.\nOn 20 October 2017, the municipality of Qalqilya named a street after Saddam Hussein and erected a memorial with his likeness. The monument was unveiled at a ceremony attended by the Qalqilya District Governor Rafi Rawajba and two other Palestinian officials. It bears the slogan \"Saddam Hussein – The Master of the Martyrs in Our Age\".\nOn 19 June 2022, a 53-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed by Israeli forces as he sought to cross the Israeli West Bank barrier, which encircles Qalqilya. According to the IDF, he damaged the security fence in an attempt to cross into Israeli territory. It's unclear whether he was armed.\nOn 22 June 2024, a 60-year-old Israeli citizen was shot dead in Qalqilya by local residents. The victim, from Petah Tikva, regularly bought vegetables in the city. Following the shooting, his car was set on fire, and his personal documents were taken. This incident was the third in Qalqilya within 48 hours, following another attack on Thursday, where a 70-year-old Israeli was killed, and the elimination of two Islamic Jihad operatives who planned an attack.\n\nGeography\nQalqilya is located in the northwestern West Bank, straddling the border with Israel. It is 16 kilometers southwest of the Palestinian city of Tulkarm, and the nearest localities are the Arab-Israeli city of Tira and the Palestinian hamlet of 'Arab al-Ramadin al-Shamali to the northeast, the Palestinian village of Nabi Ilyas to the east, the Palestinian hamlets 'Arab Abu Farda and 'Arab ar-Ramadin al-Janubi and the Israeli settlement of Alfei Menashe to the southwest, and the Palestinian village Habla and Arab-Israeli town of Jaljuliya to the south. It contains the point in the West Bank closest to the Mediterranean Sea, with about 14 km to the coast at Shefayim.\nThe average annual rainfall 587.4 millimeters and the average annual temperature is 19 degrees Celsius.\n\nDemographics\nIt had a population of 13 Muslim households, according to an Ottoman census in 1596.\nVictor Guérin found a population of 200 in 1870.\nThe British Mandate authorities conducted a census in 1922, which found that Qalqilya had a population of 2,803 (2,794 Muslims and 9 Christians),. The population was 3,867 (3,855 Muslims and 12 Christians), in a total of 796 houses, according to the 1931 census. The population was listed at 4,503 (including 4 Jews) in the 1938 census. The population of Qalqilya was 5,850 (5,840 Muslims and 10 Christians, according to the 1945 census.)\nThe population of Qalqilya was 11,401, according to a Jordanian census in 1961. A census in September 1967 found 8,922 persons, of whom 1,837 were originally from Israeli territory.\nThe Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) census recorded Qalqilya's population to be 22,168 in 1997. The majority of the inhabitants (69.8%) were Palestinian refugees or their descendants. In the 2007 census, Qalqilya's population was 41,739 (50.9% male and (49.1% female)). The number of registered households was 7,866.\nIn the 2017 census, Qalqiliya's population was 51,683.\n\nGovernment\nHamas won the 2006 municipal elections in Qalqiliya and one of its members, Wajih Qawas, became mayor, although he was incarcerated by Israel for much of his term. On 12 September 2009, the PNA dismissed Qawas for allowing Qalqiliya's debt to grow unchecked, failing to attract international funding for city projects and ignoring orders by the Palestinian government. Qawas, however, viewed his dismissal as a result of the ongoing feud between Hamas, which dominates the PNA in the Gaza Strip and Fatah, which dominates the PNA in the West Bank. Human rights groups criticized Qawas's dismissal, condemning the intervention by the central Palestinian authorities in the affairs of an elected official. During the 2012 municipal elections, Fatah member Othman Dawood was elected mayor.\n\nEconomy\nBetween 1967 and 1995 almost 80 percent of Qalqilya's labor force worked for Israeli companies or industries in the construction and agriculture sectors. The remaining 20% engaged in trade and commerce, marketing across the Green Line. According to a field survey taken by the Applied Research Institute-Jerusalem (ARIJ), 45% of Qalqilya's working population was employed by government, 25% worked in agriculture, 15% worked in trade and commerce, 10% worked in industry and 5% worked in Israeli labor. In 2012, the unemployment rate was 22%, with those most affected formerly employed in agriculture, trade and services.\nQalqilya is particularly known for its citrus crop and of its total of 10,252 dunams of land, (of which 5,930 are arable) 1802 dunams (about 17.6% of the city's land and over 30% of its arable land) are planted with citrus trees. Other major crops are olives and vegetables. Local industries include the manufacture of foodstuffs, olive oil, dairy products, soap, glass, stone, marble and building materials, in addition to the manufacture of wood, and mineral water companies.\nThe Qalqilya Zoo, established in 1986, is currently the only zoo in the West Bank and in Palestine, and, according to its owner, is the city's single-largest employer. It serves as one of Qalqilya's main attractions. The zoo houses 170 animals and works closely with zoologists from the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo and the Ramat Gan Safari. The only factory for prosthetic limbs in the northern West Bank is in Qalqilya.\n\nSouqs\nIn Qalqilya there are many markets, including:\n\nSouq Abu Amsha (سوق أبو عمشة)\nSouq Shaheen (سوق شاهين)\nSouq Abu Jaber (سوق أبو جابر)\nSouq Beshara (سوق بشارة)\nSouq Uthman  (سوق عثمان)\nSouq Um Tareq  (سوق أم طارق)\nSouq Abu Aisha  (سوق أبو عيشة)\n\nLand usage and the barrier\nOf the city's total area of 10,252 dunams, 3,027 were built-up areas, 266 were used for industrial purposes, 2,894 were planted with permanent crops, 419 were used for greenhouses, 274 for livestock ranges, 2,343 others were classified as arable, and 283 dunams were occupied by the West Bank barrier. Nearly all of Qalqilya's urban area is under Palestinian civil jurisdiction and Israeli military control (Area B), while 64.7% of the city's municipal territory, mostly agricultural lands and open spaces, is under Israeli civil and military control (Area C).\nIsrael's construction of the barrier began in 2002 and isolates Qalqilya from the north, west, south, and half of its eastern side, leaving a corridor in the east connecting it with smaller Palestinian villages and hamlets. Israel states its construction of the wall is for security purposes, particularly to prevent infiltration by Palestinian militants into Israel as had occurred during the Second Intifada. The Palestinians state that the barrier is meant to annex Palestinian lands (since the wall often juts deep into Palestinian territory) and control the movement of Palestinians. The barrier has negatively affected Qalqilya's economy, particularly the commercial and trade sectors, because it has separated the city from nearby Palestinian localities and bordering Arab towns in Israel, which contributed about 40% of the city's income prior to the barrier's completion. The barrier has also separated 1,836 dunams of mostly agricultural lands and open spaces within Qalqilya's jurisdiction from the city proper. Social relations between Qalqilya's inhabitants and those of other Palestinian cities have also been hindered by the barrier.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the 2007 PCBS census, 95.3% of the inhabitants over the age of 10 were literate. About 75% of the illiterate population were women. The town has 21 public schools, four private schools, three schools managed by UNRWA and 13 kindergartens. All schools are overseen by the Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education. As of 2012, there were 12,286 residents enrolled in school, with 660 teaching staff. In 2007, 10.5% of the population had graduated from an institution of higher education, while 15.7% had completed secondary education, 27.5% preparatory education, 27.4% elementary education and 13.8% had no formal education. There are two colleges in the city: the Ad Da'wa Islamic College established in 1978 and a campus of the Al-Quds Open University established in 1998.\n\nCulture\nThere are charities, recreational and cultural clubs, Qalqilya TV, and a radio station (Radio Nagham). In the Qalqilya governorate, the NGO Cultural Forum Society (جمعية منتدى المثقفين الخيرية) played a role in publicizing the residents' economic and political problems due to the occupation, the wall, and settlements.\n\nSister cities\nQalqilya's sister cities are:\n\n Gainesville, Florida\n Mülheim, Germany\n\nNotable people\nBahaa Al-Din Dawood Bin Ismail Al-Qalqili, a scholar of the eighth century AH who taught in Aleppo and died in the year 780 AH, according to the book Fragments of Gold in News from Gold by Ibn General Shihab al-Din al-Hanbali al-Dimashqi\nAbu Ali Iyad, Fatah field commander in Jordan and Syria\nNajm al-Din Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Qalqili, a scholar born in Qalqilya who moved to Al-Quds Al-Sharif as a child and later went Cairo to study at Al-Azhar University.

          "content": "Khan Yunis (Arabic: خان يونس, lit. 'khan (caravanserai) [of] Yunis'), also spelled Khan Younis or Khan Yunus, is a city in the southern Gaza Strip, Palestine, and serves as the capital of the Khan Yunis Governorate. It has been largely destroyed during the Gaza war.\nBefore the 14th century, Khan Yunis was a village known as \"Salqah\". A vast caravanserai, today known as Barquq Castle, was constructed there by the emir Yunis al-Nawruzi in 1387–88, an official of the Mamluk Empire to protect caravans, pilgrims, and travellers.\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Khan Yunis had a population of 205,125 in 2017. Khan Yunis, which lies only four kilometres (2+1⁄2 miles) east of the Mediterranean Sea, has a semi-arid climate with temperature of 30 °C maximum in summer and 10 °C minimum in winter, with an annual rainfall of approximately 260 mm (10.2 in).\n\nHistory\nAncient period\nHerodotus describes a city named Ienysos (Ancient Greek: Ιηνυσος) located between Lake Serbonis and Kadytis (modern Gaza city). He talks about how the Persian military marched through the location on its way to Egypt. He also describes how the coastal area between Kadytis and Ienysos was inhabited by local Arab tribes. Some sources, due to phonological resemblance of the names and due to the general matching of the geographic locations, associate this site with modern Khan Yunis.\nOther sources have suggested a further inland location of \"Khirbet Ma'in Abu Sitta\" (Palestinian village depopulated in 1949, near modern kibbutz of Nir Oz) or the Egyptian town of Arish as possible locations of Ienysos, but there is no clear evidence to support this identification.\nAncient discoveries in Khan Yunis feature a lintel with a Greek inscription, discovered repurposed in the tomb of Sheikh Hamada. The inscription translates to: 'Hilarion - giving thanks to St. Georgius.' Originally housed in the Musée de Notre Dame de France in Jerusalem, the lintel is currently lost.\n\nEstablishment by Mamluks\nBefore the 14th century, Khan Yunis was a village known as \"Salqah\". A vast caravanserai, today known as Barquq Castle, was constructed there by the emir Yunus al-Nawruzi ad-Dawadar in 1387–88, an official of the Mamluk Empire to protect caravans, pilgrims, and travellers. The growing town surrounding it was named \"Khan Yunis\" after him. Yunus was killed in battle in 1389. Yunus was the executive secretary (dawadar), one of the high-ranking officials of the Mamluk Circassian sultan Barquq. The town became an important center for trade and its weekly Thursday market drew traders from neighboring regions.\nThe khan served as resting stop for couriers of the barid, the Mamluk postal network in Palestine and Syria.\n\nOttoman period\nKhan Yunis was the site of a minor battle in late 1516, when the Egypt-based Mamluks were defeated by Ottoman forces under the leadership of Hadim Sinan Pasha. The Ottoman sultan Selim I then arrived in the area where he led the Ottoman army across the Sinai Peninsula to conquer Egypt. During the 17th and 18th centuries the Ottomans assigned an Asappes garrison associated with the Cairo Citadel to guard the fortress at Khan Yunis.\nPierre Jacotin named the village Kan Jounes on his map from 1799, while in 1838, Robinson noted Khan Yunas as a Muslim village located in the Gaza district. In 1863 French explorer Victor Guérin visited Khan Yunis. He found it had about a thousand inhabitants, and that many fruit trees, especially apricots were planted in the vicinity.\nDuring the Ottoman period, the Bedouin tribe of 'Arab al-Wahidat (عرب الوحيدات) were among the residents of Khan Yunis.\nAt the end of the 19th century, the Ottomans established a municipal council to administer the affairs of Khan Yunis, which had become the second largest town in the Gaza District after Gaza itself.\n\nBritish Mandate\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Khan Yunis had a population of 3890 inhabitants (3866 Muslims, 23 Christians, and one Jew), decreasing in the 1931 census to 3811 (3767 Muslims, 41 Christians, and three Jews), in 717 houses in the urban area and 3440 (3434 Muslims and 6 Christians) in 566 houses in the suburbs.\nIn the 1938 village statistics, the population is listed as 4,379 (including three Jews) with 3,953 in nearby suburbs. In the 1945 statistics, Khan Yunis had a population of 11,220 (11,180 Muslims and 40 Christians), with 2,302 (urban) and 53,820 (rural) dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 4,172 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 23,656 used for cereals, while 1,847 dunams were built-up land.\n\n1948–1967\nDuring the night of 31 August 1955, three Israeli paratroop companies attacked the British-built Tegart fort in Khan Yunis from where attacks had been carried out against Israelis. The police station, a petrol station and several buildings in the village of Abasan were destroyed, as well as railway tracks and telegraph poles. In heavy fighting, 72 Egyptian soldiers were killed. One Israeli soldier was killed and 17 were wounded. The operation led to a ceasefire on September 4, forcing President Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Egyptian government to halt Palestinian fedayeen operations against Israel. One of the mechanized companies was commanded by Rafael Eitan.\nBefore the Suez War, Khan Yunis was officially administered by the All-Palestine Government, seated in Gaza and later in Cairo. After a fierce firefight, the Sherman tanks of the IDF 37th Armored Brigade broke through the heavily fortified lines outside of Khan Yunis held by the 86th Palestinian Brigade. It was the only site in the Gaza strip where the Egyptian army put up any resistance to the Israeli invasion of Gaza, but it surrendered on 3 November 1956.\nThere are conflicting reports of what happened. Israel said that Palestinians were killed when Israeli forces were still facing armed resistance, while the Palestinians said all resistance had ceased by then, and that many unarmed civilians were killed as the Israel troops went through the town and camp, seeking men in possession of arms.\nThe killings, dubbed the Khan Yunis massacre, were reported to the UN General Assembly on 15 December 1956 by the Director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, Henry Labouisse. According to the report, the exact number of dead and wounded is not known, but the director received lists of names of persons allegedly killed from a trustworthy source, including 275 people, of which 140 were refugees and 135 local residents.\nAfter 1959, the All-Palestine Government of Gaza Strip was abolished and the city was included in the United Arab Republic, which was shortly disestablished and the Gaza Strip came under the direct Egyptian military occupation rule.\n\n1967 and aftermath\nIn 1967, during the Six-Day War, Israel occupied Khan Yunis again.\nAs a result of the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords, Khan Yunis and most of the Gaza Strip (excluding Israeli settlements and military areas) were placed under the control of the Palestinian Authority.\nKhan Yunis was the site of Israeli helicopter attacks in August 2001 and October 2002 that left several civilians killed, hundreds wounded and civilian buildings within the vicinity destroyed.\nThe Palestinian Authority came into control of the entirety of the Strip following the 2005 Israeli disengagement. However, following the Battle of Gaza in 2007, Hamas took over the Gaza Strip and established its own government in the region.\n\nIsrael–Gaza war\nDuring the ongoing Israel–Gaza war, Israel has bombed Khan Yunis along with other cities in the Gaza Strip as part of an offensive against Hamas. The Israeli Air Force extensively bombed much of the city, including the Hamad City apartment complex. Local sources have reported numerous civilian casualties in Khan Yunis as a result of Israeli bombings, which Palestinian news agency Wafa put at \"at least 70\" as of December 3. The Al Qarara Cultural Museum was destroyed in an explosion as a result of an Israeli attack in October 2023, part of an offensive that reportedly targeted civilian homes and mosques in the vicinity. Israeli armored units began entering the outskirts of the city in December 2023. After several months of fighting, Israeli forces ended up withdrawing from Khan Yunis and most of the southern Gaza Strip. Having failed to root out Hamas from Khan Yunis, Israeli forces began a second invasion of the city in late July 2024, which also ended in an Israeli withdrawal. Israeli forces invaded Khan Yunis yet again in August 2024, and withdrew once more at the end of the month. Following the January 2025 ceasefire, Hamas forces were seen parading through Khan Yunis. Following the resumption of the war in March, Israeli forces launched a fourth invasion of the city in May.\n\nEconomy\nKhan Yunis is the second largest urban area in the Gaza Strip after Gaza City. It serves as the principal market center of the territory's southern half and hosts a weekly Bedouin souk (\"open-air market\") mostly involving local commodities. As of 2012 Khan Yunis had the highest unemployment rate in the Palestinian territories.\n\nEducation\nUniversity College of Science and Technology\nAl Quds Open University\nPalestine College of Nursing\n\nCulture and heritage\nBarquq Castle\nBarquq Castle was a Mamluk-era fortified mosque and caravanserai. It was very damaged by the Israeli army during the Gaza war.\n\nAl Qarara Cultural Museum\nLocated in Al-Qarara, on the outskirts of Khan Yunis, the cultural museum tells the story of the history of Palestine. Key objects included Byzantine mosaics, swords dating to the Crusader period, thobes, as well as jewellery worn by women prior to the Nakba. It also included military items dating to the British Mandate in Palestine.\nThe museum's structure, display cases, and collection were destroyed in October 2023 by Israeli forces.\n\nNotable people\nHiba Abu Nada (1991-2023), poet and novelist killed in an Israeli air force bombing of her home in Khan Yunis\nRouzan al-Najjar, nurse born September 11, 1996 in Khan Younes, killed by a bullet of an Israeli army sniper in June 2018\nMohammed Assaf, singer who grew up in the Khan Yunis refugee camp, winner of the second season of Arab Idol\nMohammed Shabir (1946 – 2023), doctor in microbiology and former president of The Islamic University in Gaza killed by an Israeli sniper during Gaza War\nYahya Sinwar (1962 - 2024), Palestinian militant and politician who served as chairman of the Hamas Political Bureau from August 2024, and as the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip from February 2017, until his death in October 2024\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns – sister cities\nKhan Yunis is twinned with the following cities:\n\n Hamar, Norway\n Almuñécar, Spain\n Évry, France\n Bisceglie, Italy\n Alcamo, Italy\n\nSee also\nPalestinian refugee camps\nList of cities in Palestinian National Authority areas\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nKhan Younis articles from UNWRA\nWelcome To The City of Khan Yunis Archived 2024-01-24 at the Wayback Machine\nclose-up map of Gaza\nAir photo of Khan Yunis, 1946, with key to sites - Eran Laor Cartographic Collection, The National Library of Israel",

          "content": "Rafah (Arabic: رفح Rafaḥ [rafaħ]) is a city in the southern Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Rafah Governorate. It is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south-west of Gaza City. In 2017, Rafah had a population of 171,889. Due to the Gaza war, about 1.4 million people from Gaza City and Khan Yunis, about 70% of Gaza's population, were displaced to Rafah, as of February 2024. By April 2025, most of the city was destroyed by means of systematic razing by the Israeli military. The remnants of the city are currently under Israeli control.\nAfter the 1948 Palestine war, Egypt governed the area and refugee camps for displaced Palestinians who fled or were expelled from what became Israel were established. During the Suez Crisis, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) killed 111 Palestinians, including 103 refugees in the Rafah refugee camp, during the 1956 Rafah massacre. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Israeli forces occupied the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip after capturing them from Egypt. In the same year, IDF troops bulldozed and demolished 144 houses in the Rafah refugee camp, killing 23 Palestinians.\nWhen Israel withdrew from the Sinai in 1982, Rafah was split into a Gazan part and an Egyptian part, dividing families, separated by barbed-wire barriers. Then, since the year 2000, the core of the city was destroyed by Israel, and since the 2010s also by Egypt, in order to create a large buffer zone.\nRafah is the site of the Rafah Border Crossing, the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. Gaza's only airport, Yasser Arafat International Airport, was located just south of the city. The airport operated from 1998 to 2001, when it was bombed and bulldozed by the IDF.\n\nEtymology\nOver the ages the city has been known as Rpwḥw by the ancient Egyptians, 𒊏𒉿𒄭 Rapiḫi or 𒊏𒉿𒄷 Rapiḫu by the Assyrians, רפיח Rāphiyaḥ by the ancient Israelites, Ῥαφία Rhaphíā by the Greeks, Raphia by the Romans, and Rafh by the Arab Caliphate.\nIn English, Rafah ( (US) or   (UK)), derived from the modern Arabic, is most common, but Rafiah  (from the modern Hebrew) is also used. The form Raphiah  (from the ancient Hebrew) is used as well, especially in historical contexts such as the Battle of Raphiah.\n\nHistory\nBronze Age Raphia\nRafah has a history stretching back thousands of years. It was first recorded in an inscription of Egyptian Pharaoh Seti I, from 1303 BCE as Rph, and as the first stop on Pharaoh Shoshenq I's campaign to the Levant in 925 BCE. In 720 BCE it was the site of the Assyrian king Sargon II's victory over the Egyptians.\n\nHellenistic and Roman periods\nIn 217 BCE, the Battle of Raphia was fought between the victorious Ptolemy IV and Antiochus III. It is said to be one of the largest battles ever fought in the Levant, with over a hundred thousand soldiers and hundreds of elephants.\nAntiochus III, willing to make peace with Ptolemy V, had his daughter Cleopatra I marry Ptolemy V. Their marriage took place in 193 BC in Raphia.\nThe town was conquered by Alexander Yannai and held by the Hasmoneans until it was rebuilt in the time of Pompey and Gabinius; the latter seems to have done the actual work of restoration for the era of the town dates from 57 BCE. Rafah is mentioned in Strabo (16, 2, 31), the Antonine Itinerary, and is depicted on the Map of Madaba.\n\nByzantine period\nDuring the Byzantine period, it was a diocese, and Byzantine ceramics and coins have been found there. It was represented at the Council of Ephesus 431 CE by Bishop Romanus, but today remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church but a small Greek Orthodox presence exists.\n\nEarly Muslim to Mamluk periods\nRafah was one of the towns captured by the Rashidun army under general 'Amr ibn al-'As in 635 CE, and subsequently was an important trading city during the Early Muslim period. Under the Umayyads and Abbasids, Rafah was the southernmost border of Jund Filastin (\"District of Palestine\"). According to Arab geographer al-Ya'qubi, it was the last town in the Province of Syria and on the road from Ramla to Egypt.\nIn 1226, Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi writes of Rafah's former importance in the early Arab period, saying it was \"of old a flourishing town, with a market, and a mosque, and hostelries\". However, he goes on to say that in its current state, Rafah was in ruins, but was an Ayyubid postal station on the road to Egypt after nearby Deir al-Balah.\n\nOttoman and Egyptian period\nRafah appeared in the 1596 Ottoman tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Gaza of the Liwa of Gazza. It had a population of 15 households, all Muslim, who paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, occasional revenues, goats and/or bee hives. In 1799, the French Army of the Orient, led by Napoleon, passed through Rafah during the French campaign in Egypt and Syria. Rafah was the boundary between the provinces of Egypt and Syria. In 1832, the area came under Egyptian occupation of Muhammad Ali, which lasted until 1840.\nFrench explorer Victor Guérin, who visited Rafah in May 1863, noted two pillars of granite which the locals called Bab el Medinet, meaning \"The Gate of the town\". In 1881, Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria wrote: \"Fragments of gray granite pillars, still standing, are here to be met with about the road, the fields, and the sand, and we saw one lying on the ground half buried... The pillars are the remains of an ancient temple, Raphia, and are of special importance in the eyes of the Arabs, who call them Rafah, as they mark the boundary between Egypt and Syria.\"\n\nBritish period\nOn 9 January 1917, British forces captured Rafah, and subsequently used it as a staging post for their first attempt to capture Gaza. The presence of British military bases in Rafah served an economic draw which led to an influx of internal migration to the city. In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandatory authorities, Rafah had a population of 599 inhabitants, all of which Muslim. Nine years later, the Mandatory authorities conducted the 1931 census of Palestine, by which time Rafah's population had increased to 1,423 residents living in 228 houses, all of which were still Muslim.\nIn the Village Statistics, 1945, a joint survey conducted by the Mandatory government's Government Office of Statistics and Department of Lands for the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry, Rafah had an all-Muslim population of 2,220 people with 40,579 dunams of land. Of these, 275 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 24,173 dunams were used for growing cereals, while 16,131 dunams were un-cultivable land.\n\n1948–1967\nAfter the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt governed the area (see Palestinian Protectorate) and refugee camps were established. During the Suez Crisis, 111 Palestinians, including 103 refugees, were killed by troops of the Israel Defence Force in the Palestinian refugee camp of Rafah, during the 1956 Rafah massacre. The United Nations was unable to determine the circumstances surrounding the deaths.\nDuring the 1967 Six-Day War, Israeli forces captured Rafah as part of their invasion of the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip. The population was about 55,000, of whom only 11,000 lived in Rafah itself. On Friday, 9 June 1967, the Israeli military bulldozed & blew up 144 houses in Rafah refugee camp, killing 23 Palestinians.\n\nAfter 1967\nIn the summer of 1971, the IDF, under General Ariel Sharon (then head of the IDF southern command), destroyed approximately 500 houses in the refugee camps of Rafah in order to create patrol roads for Israeli forces. These demolitions displaced nearly 4,000 people. Israel established the Brazil and Canada housing projects to accommodate displaced Palestinians and to provide better conditions in the hopes of integrating the refugees into the general population and its standard of living; Brazil is immediately south of Rafah, while Canada was just across the border in Sinai. Both were named because UN peacekeeping troops from those respective countries had maintained barracks in those locations. After the 1978 Camp David Accords mandated the repatriation of Canada project refugees to the Gaza Strip, the Tel al-Sultan project, northwest of Rafah, was built to accommodate them.\n\nDuring the early months of First Intifada on 25 April 1989 Rafah resident Khaled Musa Armilat, aged 22, was shot dead by Israeli soldiers in Khan Yunis. In a letter to a Member of Knesset, March 1990, Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin stated that the dead man's brother had been interrogated and stated that he had been killed by Border Police but four months later he blamed the army. Rabin added the matter was being investigated by the Israeli Police.\nThree and a half weeks after Armilat's killing, 19 May, five civilians including a 50-year-old woman and a 13-year-old boy, were killed in Rafah by Israeli soldiers using plastic bullets. Two of the 12 other casualties later died of their wounds.\nIn May 2004, the Israeli Government led by, then Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon approved another mass demolition of homes in Rafah. Therefore, he obtained the nickname \"the bulldozer\".\nIn September 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip but Rafah remained divided, with part of it on the Egyptian side of the border under Egyptian rule. It has been claimed that it was in order to cope with the division of the town, that smugglers have made tunnels under the border, connecting the two parts and permitting the smuggling of goods and persons.\n\n2023–25 Gaza war\nDuring the Israeli Defence Forces' (IDF) war on Gaza, civilians were told to flee to Rafah and forcibly displaced from their homes. Although the Israeli government declared the southern half of Gaza a safe zone, the IDF proceeded to bomb the region extensively, with a New York Times investigation estimating that 2,000-pound bombs were dropped at least 200 times as of 21 December 2023.\n\nBy February 2024, roughly two-thirds of Gaza's population, or 1.4 million people, had been forcibly displaced from other parts of the territory into Rafah, with the IDF declaring its intent to enter the city. Critics have warned about the potential for mass civilian casualties in the event of a ground invasion, with the UN secretary general António Guterres arguing that \"Such an action would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences.\" On 9 February, Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the IDF to create an evacuation plan to remove civilians before launching an offensive against Rafah which is the last major population center in the Gaza Strip still under Hamas control and the elimination of Hamas was considered to be impossible as long as the four Hamas battalions in Rafah are intact. Prior to the start of the ground invasion, Israel began to intensify its strikes on Rafah from the air. More than 44 people were killed in airstrikes on Rafah on 11 February, with many likely still under the rubble. Netanyahu continued to push for a ground invasion, claiming that \"We're going to do it....Victory is within reach\".\nOn 11 February, The Wall Street Journal reported that Egypt had warned Hamas to release hostages within two weeks or face an IDF invasion of Rafah. A joint operation in Rafah by the IDF, Shin Bet, and Israel Police recovered two hostages (Fernando Marman and Luis Har) kidnapped by Hamas from Nir Yitzhak. During this operation, heavy bombardment by the IDF occurred in the area that includes many refugee camps killing 112 people with several bodies still under the rubble.\n\n2025 razing and destruction\nIn previous operations, Israel destroyed building on the border with Egypt, arguing it as a military need to cut Hamas from possible supply roads. On 3 April, about two weeks after the Gaza War resumed, the IDF advanced into Rafah as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled the city.  It soon started massive operations to raze most of Rafah itself, flattening mosques, schools, greenhouses and even greenery. By mid May 2025, The New York Times reported with satellite images and on-the-ground videos proofs that most of the city housing and buildings have been purposely razed by Israeli bulldozers or controlled destructions. Side-by-side satellite imagery of the Shaboura neighborhood show it with all its pre-war buildings, then in its early-2025 state of widespread destruction, and then on 3 May 2025 with nearly all its buildings razed to the ground. The same is visible for most of the city.\n\nDevelopment\nThe Ottoman–British agreement of 1 October 1906 established a boundary between Ottoman-ruled Palestine and British-ruled Egypt, from Taba to Rafah. After World War I, Palestine was also under British control, but the Egypt-Palestine Boundary was maintained to control movement of the local Bedouin. During the mid-1930s, the British enhanced the border control and Rafah evolved as a small boundary town that functioned as a trade and services centre for the semi-settled Beduin population. During World War II, it became an important British base.\nFollowing the Armistice Agreement of 24 February 1949, Rafah was located in Egypt-occupied Gaza and consequently, a Gaza–Egypt border did no longer exist. Rafah could grow without any consideration being taken of the old 1906 international boundary. In the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt and all of the city was now under Israeli occupation.\nIn 1979, Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty that returned the Sinai, which borders the Gaza Strip, to Egyptian control. In the Peace Treaty, the re-created Gaza–Egypt border was drawn across the city of Rafah. Rafah was divided into an Egyptian and a Palestinian part, splitting up families, separated by barbed-wire barriers. Families were separated, property was divided and many houses and orchards were cut across and destroyed by the new boundary, bulldozed, allegedly for security reasons. Rafah became one of the three border points between Egypt and Israel.\n\nDemographics\nIn 1922, Rafah's population was 599, which increased to 1,423 in 1931, increasing again to 1,635 in 1938, and further increased to 2,220 in 1945. In 1982, the total population was approximately 10,800.\nIn the 1997 Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) census, Rafah and its adjacent camp had a combined population of 91,181, Tall as-Sultan was listed with a further 17,141. Refugees made up 80.3% of the entire population. In the 1997 census, Rafah's (together with Rafah camp) gender distribution was 50.5% male and 49.5% female.\nIn the 2006 PCBS estimate, Rafah city had a population of 71,003, Rafah camp and Tall as-Sultan form separate localities for census purposes, having populations of 59,983 and 24,418, respectively.\n\nRafah Border Crossing\nRafah is the site of the Rafah Border Crossing, the sole crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. Formerly operated by Israeli military forces, control of the crossing was transferred to the Palestinian Authority in September 2005 as part of the larger Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. A European Union commission began monitoring the crossing in November 2005 amid Israeli security concerns, and in April 2006, Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas's Presidential Guard assumed responsibility for the site on the Palestinian Authority side. On the Egyptian side, the responsibility is assumed by the 750 Border Guards as per the agreement signed by Egypt and Israel in November 2005.\nFollowing the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, Israel announced on October 14, 2025, that the Rafah crossing would remain closed, with no date set for its reopening. This has restricted the entry of aid.\n\nClimate\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot semi-arid (BSh).\n\nSee also\nRafah Governorate\nRafah, Egypt\nIsrael–Gaza barrier\nGaza–Egypt border\nErez Crossing\nPhiladelphi Corridor\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\nWelcome To The City of Rafah Archived 19 February 2010 at the Wayback Machine\nRafah Today, pictures by Palestinian journalist Mohammed Omer\nRafah Smuggling Tunnels\nRafah Pundits: Rafah Focused Blog\nRaising Yousuf – Blog by Laila el-Hadad who is a reporter for Aljazeera living in Gaza\nReports from Rafah\nInterview with Hip Hop Artist Michael Franti Archived 14 November 2007 at the Wayback Machine – Reporting from Rafah.\nPart A Part B Satellite photos comparing 2001 to 2004.\nRazing Rafah: Mass Home Demolitions in the Gaza Strip – Human Rights Watch\nThe Olympia-Rafah Sister City Project – The organization started by people in the communities of Rafah, Gaza, and Olympia, WA\nThe Madison-Rafah Sister City Project – A sistering project connecting the communities of Rafah, Gaza, and Madison, WI",
          "summary": "Rafah (Arabic: رفح Rafaḥ [rafaħ]) is a city in the southern Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Rafah Governorate. It is located 30 kilometers (19 mi) south-west of Gaza City. In 2017, Rafah had a population of 171,889. Due to the Gaza war, about 1.4 million people from Gaza City and Khan Yunis, about 70% of Gaza's population, were displaced to Rafah, as of February 2024. By April 2025, most of the city was destroyed by means of systematic razing by the Israeli military.

          "content": "Beit Jala (Arabic: ) is a Palestinian Christian town in the Bethlehem Governorate of Palestine, in the West Bank. Beit Jala is located 10 km (6.2 mi)10 km south of Jerusalem, on the western side of the Hebron road, opposite Bethlehem, at 825 meters (2,707 ft) altitude. In 2017, Beit Jala had 13,484 inhabitants according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. About 80% of the population were Christians (mostly Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic) and about 20% Muslims.\nSaint Nicholas – the inspiration for Santa Claus – is the patron saint of Beit Jala, where the Church of Saint Nicholas was built over a crypt where it is believed he lived for a couple years during his time in Palestine.\n\nEtymology\nConder and Kitchener identified Beit Jala with Galem or Gallim (Γαλλιμ) of the Septuagint, a place in the 9th district of the inheritance of Judah; homonymous with a settlement in Benjamin NE of Jerusalem.\n\nHistory\nByzantine period\nA crypt, dating to the 5th or 6th century C.E., was located under the Church of Saint Nicholas in Beit Jala.\n\nCrusader period\nIn the Crusader era, the village was called Apezala, and the Church of Saint Nicholas was possibly rebuilt during that time.\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1516, the village was included in the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine. In this century, Beit Jala was a large village of Christian and  peasants and it had over ten elders (akabir) who functioned as leaders, with each religious group having separate sets of leaders. Rare for a single village, it and nearby Bethlehem, served as its own separate jurisdiction instead of being grouped with other villages into a nahiya. In April 1531, when an Ottoman official went to Beit Jala to register the village's grapevines for tax purposes, the residents refused to seriously answer his questions and mocked the authority of the Ottoman sultan, marking a notable episode of initial local resistance to the Ottoman taxation methods and procedures. By the end of the 16th century, Beit Jala was almost entirely inhabited by Christians. Beit Jala's size rendered it similar to that of a town, with the village being subdivided into four quarters. The village produced more wheat and barley than surrounding localities and like other villages south of Jerusalem, grape cultivation was greater than olive cultivation. Beit Jala was taxed on these agricultural products as well as figs, honeybees, and goats. It contained one of the six olive presses in the subdistrict of Jerusalem in the 16th century. Despite its large size, Beit Jala was relatively poorer than other villages in the subdistrict.\nIn the 1596 tax-records, it appeared as Bayt Jala, located in the Nahiya of Jabal Quds of the Liwa of Al-Quds. The population was 245 households; 6 Muslims and 239 Christians. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33,3% on agricultural products, which included  wheat, barley, olive trees, vineyards, fruit trees, occasional revenues, goats and beehives; a total of 30,000 akçe.\nIn 1697 Henry Maundrell passed Beit Jala, and noted that: \"no Turk can live in it above two years. By virtue of this report, whether true or false, the Christians keep the Village to themselves without molestation; no Turk being willing to stake his life experimenting the truth of it.\"\nIn the 17th century, the Christians of Beit Jala offered to become Catholic if the Franciscans paid their jizya tax.\nBeit Jala's inhabitants participated in the 1834 peasants' revolt in Palestine against Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian governor of Syria. Beit Jala's residents were believed to have taken part in the looting of Egyptian property and on 31 May, Egyptian troops assaulted the village. Ibrahim Pasha put a stop to the attack, but at least 33 men and women were killed in the attack. In addition, the village's livestock was seized. The attack on Beit Jala prompted rebels from the Ta'amira tribe, a local Bedouin tribe, to enter into Bethlehem to help bolster its defense.\nIn 1838, it was noted as a Greek Christian village, located in the Beni Hasan area, west of Jerusalem. The population was estimated to be around 2000 people.\nBy the mid-19th century, there were 10 Catholics living in Beit Jala. The Latin Patriarchate founded its first parish in Palestine in Beit Jala in 1853. The establishment of the parish faced fierce resistance by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and the inhabitants of Beit Jala, leading to several skirmishes and official complaints to the Ottoman authorities by both sides. A Latin church was built in Beit Jala and inaugurated on 18 April 1858. The Jerusalem Society, a Protestant movement struggled to maintain a presence in Beit Jala in the late 19th century. When a clash between Orthodox and Protestant residents ended with the death of an Orthodox girl, the village's Protestant community was evacuated to al-Karak in Transjordan for six months until compensation was paid to the family of the slain girl. In 1866, the Russian ambassador to the Ottoman Empire purchased land in Beit Jala and built a girls' school, the first Russian school to be built in Palestine. It had 60 pupils by 1880 and was assigned a Russian principal. In 1886, it became a teachers' training school and was under the administration of the Palestinian Orthodox Imperial Society.\nAlbert Socin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870  that Beit Jala had 234 houses and a population of 874 \"Latins\", though the population count included men, only. Martin Hartmann found that Beit Jala  had 232  houses.\nIn 1883, the  PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Beit Jala as: \"A large and flourishing village of white well-built stone houses, on the slope of a steep hill. The water supply is artificial, with a well in the valley below. The population is said by Pere Lievin to amount to 3,000, of whom 420 are Catholics, and the rest Orthodox Greeks. There is a Greek and a Latin church in the village. There are remarkably fine groves of olives round and beneath the village, and the hill is covered with vineyards which belong to the place.\"\nIn 1896 the population of Beit Jala was estimated to be about 2,880  persons.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Beit Jala had a population of 3,101; 3,060 Christians and 41 Muslims; where the Christians consisted of 2,628 Orthodox, 358 Roman Catholics, 4 Greek Catholic (Melkites), and 1 each of the Armenian Catholic, Maronite and the Coptic Church. In the 1931 census the population had decreased to 2,731; 2,529 Christians, 198 Muslims, 3 with \"no religion\" and 1 Jew; in a total of 631 inhabited houses.\nIn the 1945 statistics  the population of Beit Jala was 3,710; 200 Muslims and 3,510 Christians, with 13,307 (rural) and 737 (urban) dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. 9,860 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 1,064 for cereals, while 737 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\nBy the end of the Mandate, the population of Beit Jala was apprixmately 4,000.\n\nJordanian period\nIn the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Beit Jala came under Jordanian rule.\nThe Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) began relief operations for refugees in the West Bank in 1950. They also worked with Palestinians who had retained their houses and so were not technically refugees, but who had lost their land or means of making a living because of the war. As part of this relief, the MCC founded a school in Beit Jala which was still in operation as of 1979.\nIn 1952, an Israel Defense Forces reprisal raid in Beit Jala killed seven civilians; one man, two women and three children. A complaint was lodged that Israel had violated the General Armistice agreement. The United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation issued a condemnation of Israel for breaching the agreement.\nIn 1961, the population of Beit Jala was  7,966.\n\nPost 1967\nSince the Six-Day War in 1967, Beit Jala has been under Israeli occupation. Control of the town was assumed by the Palestinian Authority following the 1993 Oslo Accords. According to the Beit Jala Municipality, the city's land holdings have been relegated under different areas of administration. Area A comprises approximately 3,500 dunums, or about 25% of the town's land, which is under Palestinian control. The remaining 75% (Area C) is under Israeli jurisdiction, and 7% of the total Area C is located inside the Municipality border.\nAccording to ARIJ, after the war Israel confiscated 3,147 dunums of Beit Jala land in order to expand the Jerusalem municipal boundaries, later taking further land for the two Israeli settlements of Gilo and Har Gilo, the West Bank barrier and bypass roads.\nDuring the Second Intifada, militants from the Fatah-affiliated Tanzim group used Beit Jala as a base for launching sniper and mortar attacks on the  Israeli settlement of Gilo. Gilo is located on a hilltop across from Beit Jala, partially built on the lands of Beit Jala, Beit Safafa and Sharafat. The Israeli government built a concrete barrier and installed bulletproof windows in homes and schools facing Beit Jala.\n\nMilitants were reported to have used the houses of Palestinian Christian residents to fire on Israeli targets in Gilo. Fighters were initially welcomed by residents, but after their homes were attacked by Israeli retaliatory fire and several fighters and residents were killed, they no longer tolerated the militants' presence. According to John Bunzl, the Israeli press used the incident to suggest there was a Christian-Muslim conflict in the incidents, with the former trying to prevent an attack until the Muslims forced them to surrender. Numerous statements taken from Christian residents appear to refute this. In August 2001, the Israeli Army occupied the northeastern corner of Beit Jala, declaring that it would only leave when the gunfire on Gilo stopped. Two days later, the troops withdrew. Palestinian militants subsequently increased their attacks, adding mortars and heavy machine guns. According to Time magazine, the Palestinian militants were not locals, but took up positions in Beit Jala due to its proximity to Gilo. In August 2010, after a long period of calm, the concrete barrier built to protect Gilo was removed.\nThe Israel barrier in the West Bank will separate over 50 Beit Jala families from their land; although Israel says it is a vital security measure. Palestinians believe the ultimate aim of the barrier is a land grab as it is built inside the occupied West Bank on land Palestinians want for a future independent state. Local church leaders - Latin Catholic and Greek Orthodox - have been involved in the campaign to prevent the construction of the barrier.\n\nGeography\nThe Israel bypass road known as the Tunnels Highway passes directly underneath Beit Jala.\n\nDemographics\nThis town's Christian inhabitants are made up of five Christian tribes that trace their origins as Aramaic-and Arabic speaking people who lived in that area near Bethlehem prior to the Muslim conquest in 634. At the 1931 census of Palestine the population of Beit Jala was 2,732. This included 196 Muslims, 2,532 Christians, and one Jew. In 1947, Beit Jala had a population of approximately 3,700. In 1967, according to a census conducted by the Israeli Army Command, the population was 6,041. The population in 2007 was 11,758 according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.\n\nEconomy\nCremisan Cellars, located in the Cremisan monastery, is an important local winemaker. The winery has operated since the establishment of the monastery in the 19th century. Modern equipment was introduced in 1997. Beit Jala was once famous for its pork, olive oil, apricots and stone masonry. Other economic branches are tobacco, textiles, agriculture and pharmaceuticals. The Beit Jala Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Company (formerly Jordan Chemical Laboratory) was established in 1958 to manufacture generic drug pharmaceutical products for the local market.\nThe West Bank Barrier is being extended to encircle the area, splitting the monastery, which would end up on the Israeli side, from the sister Salesian convent, and making access to this recreational area for Beit Jala residents very difficult. 57 Christian families are slated to lose their agricultural property.\n\nHealth care\nBeit Jala has a government-run 113-bed hospital, and a 77-bed privately run specialized surgery hospital operated by the Arab Society for Rehabilitation. Primary health care is provided by the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health. In addition, there are many charities, medical institutions and private health clinics. Societies for the disabled in Beit Jala include the Bethlehem Arab Society, Lifegate Rehabilitation and House Jemima, a Dutch-founded home and daycare-center for children with mental disabilities. Al-Hussein Governmental Hospital, Beit Jala is a government hospital here.\n\nSchools and religious institutions\nBeit Jala is home to educational institutions run by a variety of Christian denominations, including the Arab Orthodox Benevolent Society. A Russian Orthodox school was established in 1866. The Latin Patriarchate Seminary, which supervises religious liturgical education in the Jerusalem Patriarchate, moved to Beit Jala in 1936.\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and the Holy Land (ELCJHL) has a congregation in Beit Jala. The denomination also runs the Talitha Kumi School in Beit Jala, which was founded by Lutheran deaconesses in the 19th century and relocated in Beit Jala in 1961. The school has developed an environmental education program and operates the only bird-ringing station in the Palestinian sector. The school also runs a guesthouse.\n\nThe Beit Jala skyline is dominated by several churches, among them the Church of the Virgin Mary, the Church of St. Michael, and the Church of Saint Nicholas. According to tradition, St. Nicholas spent four years in a cave beneath the Church. These three churches belong to the Greek Orthodox Church. The Latin Church of Annunciation is the Catholic church built in 1850.\nThe Syriac Orthodox Church runs the Mar Afram school in Beit Jala. In 2007, Mar Afram started offering classes in Aramaic (more specifically, Syriac Aramaic) to its students, which were taught by elderly residents of the town who still spoke the waning language fluently.\n\nLocal government\nIn the 2005 municipal election, six seats went to the United Beit Jala list (Fatah and Palestinian People's Party), five seats went to Sons of the Land (PFLP and independents), one seat went to Independent Beit Jala Group and one candidate was elected as an independent. The most popular candidate was Raji George Jadallah Zeidan of United Jala with 2,892 votes, followed by Nadir Antoun Issa Abu Amsha of Sons of the Land with 1764 votes.\n\nSports\nThe Beit Jala Lions is a rugby club active in Beit Jala since 2007.

          "content": "Beit Sahour or Beit Sahur (Arabic: بيت ساحور, romanized: ; Palestine grid 170/123) is a Palestinian town east of Bethlehem, in the Bethlehem Governorate of the West Bank in the State of Palestine. The city is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority. The population was of 13,281 in 2017, consisting of approximately 80% Christians (most of them Greek Orthodox) and 20% Muslims.\nChristian tradition holds Beit Sahour to be the site of the Annunciation to the Shepherds. There are two enclosures in the eastern part of Beit Sahour that are claimed by different Christian denominations to be the actual 'Shepherds Field': one belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church, and the other, the Catholic site, belonging to the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land.\nThe mainly Christian Palestinian inhabitants are being pressured by encroaching Israeli settlements, with one housing development threatened with demolition.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Beit Sahour has been translated variously as \"House of the Magicians\" by Palmer (1881), and more recently on Palestinian websites as \"House of Vigilance\" or literally as \"House of the Night Watch\".\nModern Beit Sahour is also known as Beit Sahur an-Nasara (\"Beit Sahur of the Christians\"). Another, former village near Jerusalem, known as Beit Sahur al-Atiqah (\"ancient Beit Sahur\") or Beit Sahour al-Wadi (\"Beit Sahur of the Valley\"), is fully distinct from the town of Beit Sahour in the Bethlehem Governorate.\n\nHistory\nOrigins and early demographics\nAccording to local tradition, Beit Sahour was uninhabited until the 14th century when a number of Muslim and Christian families from Wadi Musa near Petra (today in Jordan) settled in caves on the site of the modern village. Another Christian family of Wadi Musa, from the remnants of the Ghassanids, arrived in the 17th century. Further immigration in the 18th century from Rashda in Upper Egypt, Shobak in Transjordan and Al-Kukaliya \"in Syria\" cemented the Christian character of the village.\nIn spite of the influx of Christian families, they remained in the minority all until 1839, when Muslims from Palestine fought in the armies led by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt in his war against the Turkish Sultan. Huge losses, due mainly to heat and dehydration rather than battle, meant that three quarters of the male Muslims of Beit Sahour perished, leaving the Christians in the majority.\n\nOttoman period\nBeit Sahour, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the census of 1525/26 (AH 932), Beit Sahur an-Nasara ('Christian Beit Sahur') had 5 Christian and 7 Muslim households, increasing in 1538/39 (AH 945) to 8 Christian and 8 Muslim households. By 1553/34 (AH 961), 13 Christian and 21 Muslim households were noted, and in 1562/63 (AH 970), 9 Christian and 17 Muslim households were counted. In 1596, Beit Sahur an-Nasara was registered as a village in the nahiyah of Quds (Jerusalem) of the Liwa of Quds, with a total population of 24 households; 15 Muslim and 9 Christian. The villages paid taxes on the same products as the villagers of Beit Sahur al-Atiqah.\nThe Franciscans ceased holding religious services at the shrine by Shepherd's Field around 1820. In 1864 a new Roman Catholic church and school were completed.\nAn Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Beit Sahour el-foka (\"upper Beit Sahour\") had a population of 37 \"Latins\" (Catholics) in 11 houses, and 187 \"Greeks\" (Eastern Orthodox) in 48 houses, bringing the total population of both villages, Beit Sahour el-foka and Beit Sahour et-tahta (\"lower Beit Sahour\"), to 190 (men only) in 76 houses.\nIn 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Beit Sahur as:\n\nThis village is a sort of suburb of Bethlehem, situated on the same ridge, with the broad plateau east of it known as the 'Shepherd's Field' ... [with] the small Greek Church of the Grotto of the Shephard, a subterranean chapel reached by 20 steps, containing pictures and mosaic. Above the vault are ruins with a Latin altar. Bait Sahur contains a well-built modern house belonging to the Latin curé, and is surrounded with olives and vines.\nIn 1896 the population of Beit Sahour was estimated to be about 861 persons. A construction text, dating to 1897, engraved in the lintel of a door on Municipality Street has been examined, and was found to be a poem in 19th century Christian naskhi script.\n\nBritish Mandate\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Bait Sahur had a population 1,519; 285 Muslims and 1,234 Christians, increasing in the 1931 census to 1,942; 395 Muslims and 1,547 Christians, in a total of 454 houses.\nIn the 1945 statistics the population of Beit Sahour was 2,770; 370 Muslims and 2,400 Christians, who owned 6,946 (rural) and 138 (urban) dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. 1,031 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 3,641 for cereals, while 100 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\n\nJordanian annexation\nIn the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Beit Sahur was annexed by Jordan along with the rest of the West Bank.\nIn 1961, the population of Beit Sahur was 5,316.\n\nIsraeli occupation\nSince the Six-Day War in 1967, Beit Sahour has been under Israeli occupation. The population in the 1967 census was 5,380.\nAccording to ARIJ, 52.8% of the village land is classified as being in Area A, while the remaining 47.2% is in Area C. From 1997 and onwards, Israel has confiscated hundred of dunams of village land for the construction of the Israeli settlement of Har Homa. The mainly Christian Palestinian inhabitants are being pressured by encroaching Israeli settlements, with one housing development being ruled as illegal by an Israeli court in the early 2000s and, as of 2013, standing under threat of demolition.\n\nEconomy\nThe town's economy is largely based on tourism and related industries, such as the manufacture of olive-wood carvings. Agriculture and work in Israel also play a significant role. The town had a prominent role in the Palestinian national \"Bethlehem 2000\" project, as extensive renovations of tourist sites, hotels and businesses, and historic sites were carried out prior to the millennium celebrations.\nDuring the First Intifada, residents in the town had attempted to develop their own dairy industry—a move resisted by Israeli authorities. These efforts were documented in 2014 film The Wanted 18, co-directed by Palestinian filmmaker Amer Shomali and Canadian Paul Cowan.\nSocial and economic development were disrupted by the Second Intifada.\n\nPolitical activism\nBeit Sahour is a center of Palestinian political activism. The town played a key role in the First and Second Intifadas, with local activists pioneering nonviolent resistance techniques. During the First Intifada and the Second Intifada, the Palestinian Center for Rapprochement between Peoples (PCR) based in Beit Sahour encouraged non-violent activism under the aegis of the International Solidarity Movement. George Rishmawi is director of PCR. During the First Intifada, the Palestinian Center for Rapprochement between Peoples issued an invitation to Israelis of goodwill to come and spend a weekend (Shabbat) in Palestinian homes using the slogan \"Break Bread, Not Bones\".\nThe Alternative Information Center is also partly based in the town. Elias Rishmawi, a member of the Beit Sahour council, is co-founder, together with Ghassan Andoni, Majed Nassar, Rifat Odeh Kassis and Jamal Salameh, of the Alternative Tourism Group (ATG), a non-governmental organisation specializing in tours of the Palestinian territories, where the olive harvest is used as a backdrop for showing the effects of the Israeli occupation and land confiscation on the Palestinian population.\n\nTax resistance\nIn 1989, during the First Intifada, the Palestinian resistance (Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, UNLU) and Ghassan Andoni and Kamel Danoun, urged people to stop paying taxes to Israel, which inherited and modified the previous Jordanian tax-collection regime in the West Bank. \"No taxation without representation,\" said a statement from the organizers. \"The military authorities do not represent us, and we did not invite them to come to our land. Must we pay for the bullets that kill our children or for the expenses of the occupying army?\" The people of Beit Sahour responded to this call with an organized citywide tax strike that included refusal to pay and file tax returns.\nIsraeli defense minister Yitzhak Rabin responded: \"We will teach them there is a price for refusing the laws of Israel.\" The Israeli military authorities placed the town under curfew for 42 days, blocked food shipments into the town, cut telephone lines to the town, tried to bar reporters from the town, imprisoned ten residents (among them Fuad Kokaly and Rifat Odeh Kassis) and seized in house-to-house raids millions of dollars in money and property belonging to 350 families. The Israeli military stopped the consuls-general of Belgium, Britain, France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Sweden when they attempted to go to Beit Sahour and investigate the conditions there during the tax strike.\nIsrael's military occupation had the authority to create and enforce taxes beyond the baseline Jordanian code enacted in 1963 in areas formerly administered by that country, including Beit Sahour. During the Intifada, they used that authority to impose taxes on Palestinians as collective punishment measures to discourage the Intifada, for instance \"the glass tax (for broken windows), the stones tax (for damage done by stones), the missile tax (for Gulf War damage), and a general intifada tax, among others.\"\nThe United Nations Security Council considered a resolution demanding that Israel return the property it confiscated during the Beit Sahour tax resistance. The United States vetoed the resolution, which was supported by the other eleven council members.\n\nDevelopment projects\n'Ush Ghurab, a hill occupied by a military base until 2006, is now the site of a development project. A restaurant, a climbing tower, a football field and a park are being built on the hillside. The municipality of Beit Sahour also has plans for a hospital and a sports center.\n\nMunicipal government\nThe municipal council of Beit Sahour was established by the British Mandate on April 16, 1926, but was formally implemented in 1929. Prior to that date, the first village council was established in 1925 at the initiative of the citizens of Beit Sahour. The village council developed into a municipal council in 1955 under the chairmanship of Nicola Abu Eita.\nIn the 2005 municipal election, two lists gained seats in the municipal council. Eight seats went to 'United Beit Sahour' and five to 'Sons of Beit Sahour'. The most popular vote was for Hani Naji Atallah Abdel Masieh of United Beit Sahour with 2,690 votes, followed by Elen Michael Saliba Qsais of Sons of Bethlehem with 2,280 votes.\n\nDemography\nAccording to the 1984 census, there were 8,900 Beit Sahouris. 67% were Greek Orthodox, 17% were Sunni Muslim, 8% were Latin Catholic, 6% were Greek Catholic and 2% were Lutheran.\n\n\"Shepherds' Field\" pilgrimage churches\nThe old core of Beit Sahour is reputed to be close to the place where, according to the New Testament, an angel announced the birth of Jesus to the shepherds—the \"Annunciation to the shepherds\". The eastern part of Beit Sahour is home to two sites alleged to be the biblical \"Shepherds' Field\".\n\nGreek Orthodox monastery\nKenisat er-Ruwat is the name of the site where, according to tradition, St. Helena built a convent, which is today known as the shepherd's cave. The Franciscans acquired a shrine there in 1347.\nThe Status Quo, a 250-year old understanding between religious communities, applies in principle to the site, although no concrete regulations could be found.\nThe new Greek Orthodox monastery, which includes on its grounds the ancient church, was established through the efforts of Archimandrite Serapheim Savvaitis as a metochion of the Lavra of St. Sabbas between 1971 and 1989.\n\nCatholic monastery\nThe Catholic site belongs to the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land and includes the Chapel of the Shepherds' Field, along with two cave chapels and the ruins of a Byzantine monastery known in Arabic as Khirbet Siyar el-Ghanem (\"Ruins of the Sheepfold\").\n\nArchaeology\nKhirbet Umm-Toba\nWithin the environs of Beit Sahour is the ruin Khirbet Umm Toba. An archaeological survey-excavation was conducted at the site in 2010, 2013 and 2016 by Zubair Adawi on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), which yielded pottery from the Byzantine era. Some had surmised that the site may have been the Caphartobas of Josephus.\n\nKhirbet Beit Bassa\nIn the southern outskirts of the village is the ruin Khirbet Beit Bassa, which is identified with Bethbassi, a fortress in the toparchy of Herodium in which Hasmonean leader Jonathan Appus was besieged by Seleucid general Bacchides.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nBeit Sahour is twinned with many cities and communes across the world.\n\nNotable people\nGhassan Andoni (b. 1956), physics professor and non-violent resistance activist\nLaila al-Atrash (1948–2021),  writer and journalist\nIsraa Ghrayeb, 2019 \"honour killing\" victim\nMunther Isaac (b. 1979), pastor, author, and theologian\nRifat Odeh Kassis, human rights and community activist active since the 1990s\nFuad Kokaly (b. 1962), former mayor, politician and diplomat\nQustandi Shomali (b. 1946), professor of history\nMazin B.

It surrounded the tomb of Sheikh Ahmad al-Sahuri, a local saint to whom the local Arab tribe of al-Sawahreh Mujir al-Din mentions this place in a biography of a Muslim scholar Sha'ban bin Salim bin Sha'ban, who died in Beit Sahur al-Atiqah in 1483 at the age of 105. \nIn 1596, Beit Sahour al-Wadi appeared in Ottoman tax registers as a village in the nahiyah of Quds of the Liwa of Quds. Beit Sahour al-Wadi had a population of 40 Muslim households. The villagers paid taxes on wheat, barley, vines or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 4,500 akçe. All of the revenue went to waqfs; half of which was to the madrasah Muzhiriyya in Jerusalem.\nThe place was noted by French geographer Guerin in 1863 as being 40 minutes south-east of Jerusalem, a short distance south of the Kidron Valley.\nAn Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Beit Sahour et-Tahta (\"the lower Beit Sahour\") [mislabelled?] had a population of 66 (whereby only \nmen were counted), with a total of 17 houses.\nIn 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described the place as: \"Ruins of a village with wells and a mukam.\" Clermont-Ganneau found here several old tombs in the 1890s.\n\nSee also\nHerodium, nearby major archaeological site\nPalestinian Christians\nPalestinian diaspora\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nBeit Sahour Municipality\nHistory of Beit Sahour residents\nBeit Sahour City\nWelcome To The City of Bayt Sahur\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 17: IAA, Wikimedia commons\nBeit Sahour City Profile, Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem (ARIJ), 2010\np.35, also separately as \"The priorities and needs for development in Beit Sahour city based on the community and local authorities' assessment\"\nBeit Sahour, A living Heritage on YouTube",

          "content": "Battir (Arabic: بتير, Hebrew: ביתר) is a Palestinian village in the Bethlehem Governorate of the State of Palestine, in the West Bank, 6.4 km west of Bethlehem, and southwest of Jerusalem. In 2017, the village had a population of 4,696.\nBattir has long history that dates back to ancient times. Within its area is an archaeological site containing the remains of Beitar, an ancient Jewish village and the last stronghold of the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire. The village is particularly known for its ancient terraces and an irrigation system that dates back to the Roman period. Due to this, In 2014, Battir was inscribed in the List of World Heritage Sites as a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine, under the name Battir – Land of Olives and Vines — Cultural Landscape of Southern Jerusalem.\nBattir was inhabited during the Byzantine and Islamic periods, and in the Ottoman and British Mandate censuses its population was recorded as primarily Muslim. In former times, the city lay along the route from Jerusalem to Bayt Jibrin. Battir is situated just above the modern route of the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway, which served as the armistice line between Israel and Jordan from 1949 until the Six-Day War, when it was occupied by Israel. In 2007, Battir had a population of about 4,000.\n\nEtymology\nThe Arabic name Battīr preserves the name Betar, an ancient Jewish town destroyed in the Bar Kokhba revolt, whose ruins can be found within the present-day village. The name is first recorded in the Septuagint, in a verse missing from the Masoretic Text, as Bαιθηρ, or in some manuscripts Θεθηρ.\n\nHistory\nAncient period\nBattir is built just north east of Khirbet el-Yahud (Arabic: خربة اليهود, lit. 'Ruin of the Jews'), also known as Tel Beitar, an archeological site that comprises the ruins of ancient Betar. It was continuously inhabited since the Iron Age up until the second century CE, when the Romans destroyed it during the Bar Kokhba revolt.\nSpearheads, stone balls, vessels, two cisterns, and coins from both the First Jewish-Roman War and the Bar Kokhba revolt were found in Battir in 1907 when three local families who owned the land near the ruin began cleaning the stones. The Warren Cup is also said to have been found near Battir.\nAccording to one Jewish tradition, it is also the site of the tomb of the Tannaic sage Eleazar of Modi'im.\n\nByzantine period\nA mosaic from the late Byzantine or early Islamic period was found in Battir.\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1596, Battir appeared in Ottoman tax registers as a village in the Nahiya of Quds in the Liwa of Quds. It had a population of 24 households and two bachelors, all Muslims, and paid taxes on wheat, summer crops or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 4,800 Akçe. All of the revenue went to a Waqf.\nIn 1838 it was noted as Bittir, a Muslim village in the Beni Hasan district, west of Jerusalem.\nFrench explorer Victor Guérin visited the place in 1863, while an Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Battir had a population of 239, in a total of 62 houses, though that population count only included men. It was further noted that it had \"a beautiful spring flowing through the courtyard of the mosque\".\nIn 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Battir as a moderate sized village, on the precipitous slope of a deep valley.\nIn 1896 the population of Bettir was estimated to be about 750 persons.\n\nIn the 20th century, Battir's development was linked to its location alongside the railroad to Jerusalem, which provided access to the marketplace as well as income from passengers who disembarked to refresh themselves en route.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Batir had an all Muslim population of 542 persons, increasing in the 1931 census to 758; 755 Muslims, two Christians and one Jew, in 172 houses.\nIn the 1945 statistics the population of Battir was 1,050, all Muslims, with a total of 8,028 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 1,805 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 2,287 for cereals, while 73 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\n\nJordanian period\nDuring the 1948 war, most of the villagers had fled, but Mustafa Hassan and a few others stayed. At night they would light candles in the houses, and in the morning they would take out the cattle. When nearing the village, the Israelis thought Battir was still inhabited and gave up attacking. The armistice line was drawn between the railroad and the main part of the village, with Battir ending up just meters from Jordan's border with Israel on the Jordanian side. At least 30% of Battir's land lies on the Israeli side of the Green Line, as well as a few of its buildings, but the villagers were allowed to keep it in return for preventing damage to the railway, thus being the only Palestinians officially allowed to cross into Israel and work their lands before the Six-Day War. The parts of Battir falling on the Israeli side of the Green Line are officially within the territorial jurisdiction of the Mateh Yehuda Regional Council but do not have a local committee of their own and the council's authority is not exercised there.\nBattir came under Jordanian administration following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and was annexed by Jordan in 1950.\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 1,321 inhabitants in Battir.\n\nPost-1967\nSince the Six-Day War in 1967, the status of Battir changed from Jordanian rule on to Israeli occupation. The population in the 1967 census was 1445.\nSince the signing of the Oslo II Accord in 1995, Battir has been administered by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). It is governed by a village council currently administrated by nine members appointed by the PNA. 23.7% of the village's lands were classified as Area B, while the remaining 76.3% were classified as Area C.\nIn 2007, Battir had a population of 3,967, in 2012 the population was estimated at 4,500. In 2024, Israel approved a new settlement on the UNESCO World Heritage Site, which Peace Now denounced as a threat to Battir's \"ancient terraces and sophisticated irrigation systems, evidence of thousands of years of human activity\".\n\nGeography\nBattir is located 6.4 kilometres (4.0 mi) north-west of Bethlehem on a hill above Wadi el-Jundi (lit. \"Valley of the Soldier\"), which runs southwest through the Judean hills to the coastal plain.\nThe village's historical core is characterized by its dense structure, surrounded by agricultural terraces. A newer section of Battir extends along the main way to Bethlehem. Ein al-Balad, the village's spring, is encased in a spring house.\nThe PEF's Survey of Western Palestine in 1883 described the city's natural defenses, saying its houses stand upon rock terraces, having a rocky scarp below; thus from the north the place is very strong, whilst on the south a narrow neck between two ravine heads connects the hill with the main ridge. At an elevation of around 760 metres (2,490 ft) above sea level, Battir's summers are temperate, and its winters mild with occasional snowfall. The average annual temperature is 16o C.\n\nAncient irrigation system and terraces\nBattir has a unique irrigation system that utilizes man-made terraces (habbai'l) and a system of manually diverting water via sluice gates. The Roman-era network is still in use, fed by seven springs which have provided fresh water for 2,000 years. The irrigation system runs through a steep valley near the Green Line where a section of the Ottoman-era Hejaz Railway was laid. Battir's eight main clans take turns each day to water the village's crops. Hence a local saying that in Battir \"a week lasts eight days, not seven.\" According to anthropologist Giovanni Sontana of UNESCO, \"There are few, if any, places left in the immediate region where such a traditional method of agriculture remains, not only intact, but as a functioning part of the village.\"\n\nIn 2007, the village of Battir sued the Israeli Defense Ministry to try to force them to change the planned route of the Israeli West Bank barrier which would cut through part of Battir's 2,000-year-old irrigation system, which is still in use. The Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA), which approved the fence's original route in 2005, changed its mind and wrote in a 13-page policy paper that Battir's terraces were also an Israeli heritage site and should be carefully safeguarded, stating that agricultural terraces around Battir attesting to millennia-old methods of farming in the region will be irreversibly harmed by the fence, no matter how narrow its route. It was the first time an Israeli government agency expressed opposition to the construction of a segment of the fence. This affidavit was one of four expert opinions that contended the fence would decimate the unique farming system, and in early May 2013, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that the Defense Ministry must explain “why should the route of the separation barrier in the Battir village area not be nullified or changed, and alternately why should the barrier not be reconfigured.” The Defense Ministry had to submit a new plan for securing the border that will not destroy Battir by July 2, 2013. A separate petition against the separation barrier was also filed by the nearby Jewish city Beitar Illit, fearing that it would prevent them from expanding the settlement.\n\nIn 2011 UNESCO awarded Battir a $15,000 prize for \"Safeguarding and Management of Cultural Landscapes\" due to its care for its ancient terraces and irrigation system.\nIn May 2012, the Palestinian National Authority sent a delegation to UNESCO headquarters in Paris to discuss the possibility of adding Battir to its World Heritage List. The PNA's deputy minister of tourism, Hamadan Taha, said that the organization wants to \"maintain it as a Palestinian and humanitarian heritage,\" making special note of its historic terraces and irrigation systems. the nomination of Battir was blocked at the last minute because the formal submission was too late. In a document concerning the damage the separation barrier would do to the area, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA) noted \"The struggle of our neighbors to name the area a World Heritage Site places us in an embarrassing position, and we should work together with them to protect the landscape.\" The area was designated a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine in 2014.\nIn January 2015, according to the village mayor Akram Badir, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected the IDF request to build the separation barrier through the village\n\nCulture and cuisine\nBattir is renowned for its distinctive local eggplant variety, known as the Battiri eggplant or \"Bitinjan Battiri\" to Palestinians. This elongated eggplant features a light purple hue and seedless, soft white flesh, and is a key ingredient in Palestinian dishes such as Maqluba. Battir is also known for its khyar abyad, a white cucumber grown in the village and in nearby Wadi Fukin.\nEvery summer, Battir hosts the Eggplant Festival, an event dedicated to supporting local producers and farmers, and celebrating the cultivation of the renowned Battiri eggplants.\n\nDemography\nAmong the residents of Battir village are members of the Abu 'Ebeid Allah, Abu Ni'ma, Batma, Batha, Kttoush, Mashni, Mu'ammar, and 'Uweina families.\n\nArchaeology\nAn old Roman bath fed by a spring is located in the middle of the village.\nArchaeologist D. Ussishkin dates the village to the Iron Age, and states that at the time of the Revolt it was a village of between one and two thousand people chosen by Bar Kochba for its spring, defensible hilltop location, and proximity to the main Jerusalem-Gaza road. A Roman inscription was also discovered near one of the city's natural springs on which are inscribed the names of the Fifth Macedonian Legion and the Eleventh Claudian Legion, which said legions presumably took part in the siege of the city during Emperor Hadrian's reign.\nThere isn't any evidence of habitation in the period immediately after the Revolt.\n\nSister cities\nLuton, United Kingdom\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nWelcome To Battir\nBattir, Welcome to Palestine\nBattir Village (Fact Sheet), Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem (ARIJ)\nBattir Village Profile, ARIJ\nBattir Village Area Photo, ARIJ\nBattir Video",

In 2017, the village had a population of 4,696.\nBattir has long history that dates back to ancient times. Within its area is an archaeological site containing the remains of Beitar, an ancient Jewish village and the last stronghold of the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire. The village is particularly known for its ancient terraces and an irrigation system that dates back to the Roman period. Due to this, In 2014, Battir was inscribed in the List of World Heritage Sites as a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine, under the name Battir – Land of Olives and Vines — Cultural Landscape of Southern Jerusalem.\nBattir was inhabited during the Byzantine and Islamic periods, and in the Ottoman and British Mandate censuses its population was recorded as primarily Muslim. In former times, the city lay along the route from Jerusalem to Bayt Jibrin. Battir is situated just above the modern route of the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway, which served as the armistice line between Israel and Jordan from 1949 until the Six-Day War, when it was occupied by Israel. In 2007, Battir had a population of about 4,000.",

          "content": "The Aqsa Mosque, also known as the Qibli Mosque or Qibli Chapel, is the main congregational mosque or prayer hall in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem. In some sources the building is also named al-Masjid al-Aqṣā, but this name primarily applies to the whole compound in which the building sits, which is itself also known as \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\". The wider compound is known as Al-Aqsa or Al-Aqsa mosque compound, also known as al-Ḥaram al-Sharīf.\nAccording to Islamic tradition, a small prayer hall (musalla), what would later become the Al-Aqsa Mosque, was built by Umar, the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. In the reign of the caliph Mu'awiyah I of the Umayyad Caliphate (founded in AD 661), a quadrangular mosque for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers is recorded somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif. \nThe present-day mosque, located on the south wall of the compound, was originally built by the fifth Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) or his successor al-Walid I (r. 705–715) (or both) as a congregational mosque on the same axis as the Dome of the Rock, a commemorative Islamic monument. After being destroyed in an earthquake in 746, the mosque was rebuilt in 758 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. It was further expanded upon in 780 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi, after which it consisted of fifteen aisles and a central dome. However, it was again destroyed during the 1033 Jordan Rift Valley earthquake. The mosque was rebuilt by the Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021–1036), who reduced it to seven aisles but adorned its interior with an elaborate central archway covered in vegetal mosaics; the current structure preserves the 11th-century outline.\nDuring the periodic renovations undertaken, the ruling Islamic dynasties constructed additions to the mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, façade, minarets, and minbar and interior structure. Upon its capture by the Crusaders in 1099, the mosque was used as a palace; it was also the headquarters of the religious order of the Knights Templar. After the area was conquered by Saladin in 1187, the structure's function as a mosque was restored. More renovations, repairs, and expansion projects were undertaken in later centuries by the Ayyubids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council of British Palestine, and during the Jordanian rule of the West Bank. Since the beginning of the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the mosque has remained under the independent administration of the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.\n\nDefinition\nThe \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\" translates into \"the Farthest Mosque\" in English.\n\nThe Arabic term \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\" is the translation of both al-Masjid al-Aqṣā and Jāmiʿ al-Aqṣā, which have distinct meanings in Arabic. The former (al-Masjid al-Aqṣā) refers to the Quran's Surah 17 – \"the furthest mosque\" – and thus is used for the whole compound of the Temple Mount, also known as the Haram al-Sharif, while the latter name (Jāmiʿ al-Aqṣā) is used for the subject of this article – the silver-domed congregational mosque building. Arabic and Persian writers such as 10th-century geographer al-Muqaddasi, 11th-century scholar Nasir Khusraw, 12th-century geographer al-Idrisi and 15th-century Islamic scholar Mujir al-Din, as well as 19th-century American and British Orientalists Edward Robinson, Guy Le Strange and Edward Henry Palmer explained that the term Masjid al-Aqsa refers to the entire esplanade plaza also known as the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif ('Noble Sanctuary') – i.e. the entire area including the Dome of the Rock, the fountains, the gates, and the four minarets – because none of these buildings existed at the time the Quran was written. Al-Muqaddasi referred to the southern building (the subject of this article) as Al Mughattâ (\"the covered-part\") and Nasir Khusraw referred to it with the Persian word Pushish (also the \"covered part\", exactly as \"Al Mughatta\") or the Maqsurah (a part-for-the-whole synecdoche).\nThe building is also referred to as (al-)Qibli Mosque or (al-)Qibli Chapel (Muṣallā al-Qiblī), in reference to its location on the southern end of the compound as a result of the Islamic qibla being moved from Jerusalem to Mecca. \"Qibli\" is the name used in official publications by the governmental organization which administers the site, the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf (part of the Jordanian government), and the Jordanian government more widely. It is also the official name used by the Palestine Liberation Organization. It has been used by numerous international organizations such as the United States State Department the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (whose role is to act as \"the collective voice of the Muslim world\"), and UNESCO, as well as various scholars and media organizations.\n\nHistory\nPre-construction\nThe mosque is located on the southern part of the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif, an enclosure expanded by King Herod the Great beginning in 20 BCE during his reconstruction of the Second Jewish Temple. The mosque resides on an artificial platform that is supported by arches constructed by Herod's engineers to overcome the difficult topographic conditions resulting from the southward expansion of the enclosure into the Tyropoeon and Kidron valleys. During the late Second Temple period, the present site of the mosque was occupied by the Royal Stoa, a basilica running the southern wall of the enclosure. The Royal Stoa was destroyed along with the Temple during the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE.\nIt was once thought that Emperor Justinian's \"Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos\", lit. 'the New Church of the God-Bearer' and commonly known as the Nea Church, dedicated to the God-bearing Virgin Mary, consecrated in 543, was situated where al-Aqsa Mosque was later constructed. However, remains identified as those of the Nea Church were uncovered in the south part of the Jewish Quarter in 1973.\nAnalysis of the wooden beams and panels removed from the mosque during renovations in the 1930s shows they are made from Lebanese cedar and cypress. Radiocarbon dating gave a large range of ages, some as old as the 9th century BCE, showing that some of the wood had previously been used in older buildings. However, reexamination of the same beams in the 2010s gave dates in the Byzantine period.\nDuring his excavations in the 1930s, Robert Hamilton uncovered portions of a multicolor mosaic floor with geometric patterns, but did not publish them. The date of the mosaic is disputed: Zachi Dvira considers that they are from the pre-Islamic Byzantine period, while Baruch, Reich and Sandhaus favor a much later Umayyad origin on account of their similarity to a mosaic from an Umayyad palace excavated adjacent to the Temple Mount's southern wall. By comparing the photographs to Hamilton's excavation report, Di Cesare determined that they belong to the second phase of mosque construction in the Umayyad period. Moreover, the mosaic designs were common in Islamic, Jewish and Christian buildings from the 2nd to the 8th century. Di Cesare suggested that Hamilton didn't include the mosaics in his book because they were destroyed to explore beneath them.\n\nUmayyad period\nA mostly wooden, rectangular mosque on the Temple Mount site with a capacity for 3,000 worshippers is attested by the Gallic monk Arculf during his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in c. 679–682. Its precise location is not known. The art historian Oleg Grabar deems it likely that it was close to the present mosque, while the historian Yildirim Yavuz asserts it stood at the present site of the Dome of Rock. The architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell notes that Arculf's attestation lends credibility to claims by some Islamic traditions and medieval Christian chronicles, which he otherwise deems legendary or unreliable, that the second Rashidun caliph, Umar (r. 634–644), ordered the construction of a primitive mosque on the Temple Mount. However, Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of Caliph Mu'awiya I (r. 661–680), founder of the Syria-based Umayyad Caliphate. Mu'awiya had been governor of Syria, including Palestine, for about twenty years before becoming caliph and his accession ceremony was held in Jerusalem. The 10th-century Jerusalemite scholar Ibn Tahir claims Mu'awiya built a mosque on the Haram.\nThere is disagreement as to whether the present al-Aqsa Mosque was originally built by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) or his successor, his son al-Walid I (r. 705–715). Several architectural historians hold that Abd al-Malik commissioned the project and that al-Walid finished or expanded it. Abd al-Malik inaugurated great architectural works on the Temple Mount, including construction of the Dome of the Rock in c. 691. A common Islamic tradition holds that Abd al-Malik simultaneously commissioned the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque. As both were intentionally built on the same axis, Grabar comments that the two structures form \"part of an architecturally thought-out ensemble comprising a congregational and a commemorative building\", the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, respectively. Guy le Strange claims that Abd al-Malik used materials from the destroyed Church of Our Lady to build the mosque and points to possible evidence that substructures on the southeast corners of the mosque are remains of the church.\nThe earliest source indicating al-Walid's work on the mosque is the Aphrodito Papryi. These contain the letters between al-Walid's governor of Egypt in December 708–June 711 and a government official in Upper Egypt which discuss the dispatch of Egyptian laborers and craftsmen to help build the al-Aqsa Mosque, referred to as the \"Mosque of Jerusalem\". The referenced workers spent between six months and a year on the construction. Several 10th and 13th-century historians credit al-Walid for founding the mosque, though the historian Amikam Elad doubts their reliability on the matter. In 713–714, a series of earthquakes ravaged Jerusalem, destroying the eastern section of the mosque, which was subsequently rebuilt by al-Walid's order. He had gold from the Dome of the Rock melted to use as money to finance the repairs and renovations. He is credited by the early 15th-century historian al-Qalqashandi for covering the mosque's walls with mosaics. Grabar notes that the Umayyad-era mosque was adorned with mosaics, marble, and \"remarkable crafted and painted woodwork\". The latter are preserved partly in the Palestine Archaeological Museum and partly in the Islamic Museum.\nEstimates of the size of the Umayyad-built mosque by architectural historians range from 112 by 39 meters (367 ft × 128 ft) to 114.6 by 69.2 meters (376 ft × 227 ft). The building was rectangular. In the assessment of Grabar, the layout was a modified version of the traditional hypostyle mosque of the period. Its \"unusual\" characteristic was that its aisles laid perpendicular to the qibla wall. The number of aisles is not definitively known, though fifteen is cited by a number of historians. The central aisle, double the width of the others, was probably topped by a dome.\nThe last years of Umayyad rule were turbulent for Jerusalem. The last Umayyad caliph, Marwan II (r. 744–750), punished Jerusalem's inhabitants for supporting a rebellion against him by rival princes, and tore down the city's walls. In 746, the al-Aqsa Mosque was ruined in an earthquake. Four years later, the Umayyads were toppled and replaced by the Iraq-based Abbasid Caliphate.\n\nAbbasid period\nThe Abbasids generally exhibited little interest in Jerusalem, though the historian Shelomo Dov Goitein notes they \"paid special tribute\" to the city during the early part of their rule, and Grabar asserts that the early Abbasids' work on the mosque suggests \"a major attempt to assert Abbasid sponsorship of holy places\". Nevertheless, in contrast to the Umayyad period, maintenance of the al-Aqsa Mosque during Abbasid rule often came at the initiative of the local Muslim community, rather than from the caliph. The second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur (r. 754–775), visited Jerusalem in 758, on his return from the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. He found the structures on the Haram in ruins from the 746 earthquake, including the al-Aqsa Mosque. According to the tradition cited by Mujir al-Din, the caliph was beseeched by the city's Muslim residents to fund the buildings' restoration. In response, he had the gold and silver plaques covering the mosque's doors converted into dinars and dirhams to finance the reconstruction.\nA second earthquake damaged most of al-Mansur's repairs, except for the southern portion near the mihrab (prayer niche indicating the qibla). In 780, his successor, al-Mahdi, ordered its reconstruction, mandating that his provincial governors and other commanders each contribute the cost of a colonnade. Al-Mahdi's renovation is the first known to have written records describing it. The Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi, writing in 985, provided the following description:\n\nThis mosque is even more beautiful than that of Damascus ... the edifice [after al-Mahdi's reconstruction] rose firmer and more substantial than ever it had been in former times. The more ancient portion remained, even like a beauty spot, in the midst of the new ... the Aqsa mosque has twenty-six doors ... The centre of the Main-building is covered by a mighty roof, high pitched and gable-wise, over which rises a magnificent dome.\nAl-Muqaddasi further noted that the mosque consisted of fifteen aisles aligned perpendicularly to the qibla and possessed an elaborately decorated porch with the names of the Abbasid caliphs inscribed on its gates. According to Hamilton, al-Muqaddasi's description of the Abbasid-era mosque is corroborated by his archaeological findings in 1938–1942, which showed the Abbasid construction retained some parts of the older structure and had a broad central aisle topped by a dome. The mosque described by al-Muqaddasi opened to the north, toward the Dome of the Rock, and, unusually according to Grabar, to the east.\nOther than al-Mansur and al-Mahdi, no other Abbasid caliphs visited Jerusalem or commissioned work on the al-Aqsa Mosque, though Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) ordered significant work elsewhere on the Haram. He also contributed a bronze portal to the mosque's interior, and the geographer Nasir Khusraw noted during his 1047 visit that al-Ma'mun's name was inscribed on it. Abd Allah ibn Tahir, the Abbasid governor of the eastern province of Khurasan (r. 828–844), is credited by al-Muqaddasi for building a colonnade on marble pillars in front of the fifteen doors on the mosque's front (north) side.\n\nFatimid period\nIn 970, the Egypt-based Fatimid Caliphate conquered Palestine from the Ikhshidids, nominal allegiants of the Abbasids. Unlike the Abbasids and the Muslim inhabitants of Jerusalem, who were Sunnis, the Fatimids followed Shia Islam in its Isma'ili form. In 1033, another earthquake severely damaged the mosque. The Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021–1036) had the mosque reconstructed between 1034 and 1036, though work was not completed until 1065, during the reign of Caliph al-Mustansir (r. 1036–1094).\nThe new mosque was considerably smaller, reduced from fifteen aisles to seven, probably a reflection of the local population's significant decline by this time. Excluding the two aisles on each side of the central nave, each aisle was made up of eleven arches running perpendicular to the qibla. The central nave was twice the breadth of the other aisles and had a gabled roof with a dome. The mosque likely lacked the side doors of its predecessor.\nA prominent and distinctive feature of the new construction was the rich mosaic program endowed to the drum of the dome, the pendentives leading to the dome, and the arch in front of the mihrab. These three adjoining areas covered by the mosaics are collectively referred to as the \"triumphal arch\" by Grabar or the \"maqsura\" by Pruitt. Mosaic designs were rare in Islamic architecture in the post-Umayyad era and al-Zahir's mosaics were a revival of this Umayyad architectural practice, including Abd al-Malik's mosaics in the Dome of the Rock, but on a larger scale. The drum mosaic depicts a luxurious garden inspired by the Umayyad or Classical style. The four pendentives are gold and characterized by indented roundels with alternating gold and silver planes and patterns of peacock's eyes, eight-pointed stars, and palm fronds. On the arch are large depictions of vegetation emanating from small vases.\n\nAtop the mihrab arch is a lengthy inscription in gold directly linking the al-Aqsa Mosque with Muhammad's Night Journey (the isra and mi'raj) from the \"masjid al-haram\" to the \"masjid al-aqsa\". It marked the first instance of this Quranic verse being inscribed in Jerusalem, leading Grabar to hypothesize that it was an official move by the Fatimids to magnify the site's sacred character. The inscription credits al-Zahir for renovating the mosque and two otherwise unknown figures, Abu al-Wasim and a sharif, al-Hasan al-Husayni, for supervising the work.\nNasir Khusraw described the mosque during his 1047 visit. He deemed it \"very large\", measuring 420 by 150 cubits on its western side. The distance between each \"sculptured\" marble column, 280 in number, was six cubits. The columns were supported by stone arches and lead joints. He noted the following features:\n\n ... the mosque is everywhere flagged with coloured marble ... The Maksurah [or space railed off for the officials] is facing the centre of the south wall [of the Mosque and Haram Area], and is of such size as to contain sixteen columns. Above rises a mighty dome that is ornamented with enamel work.\nAl-Zahir's substantial investment in the Haram, including the al-Aqsa Mosque, amid the political instability in the capital Cairo, rebellions by Bedouin tribes, especially the Jarrahids of Palestine, and plagues, indicate the caliph's \"commitment to Jerusalem\", in Pruitt's words. Although the city had experienced decreases in its population in the preceding decades, the Fatimids attempted to build up the magnificence and symbolism of the mosque, and the Haram in general, for their own religious and political reasons. The present-day mosque largely retains al-Zahir's plan.\nFatimid investment in Jerusalem ground to a halt toward the end of the 11th century as their rule became further destabilized. In 1071, a Turkish mercenary, Atsiz, was invited by the city's Fatimid governor to rein in the Bedouin, but he turned on the Fatimids, besieging and capturing Jerusalem that year. A few years later, the inhabitants revolted against him, and were slaughtered by Atsiz, including those who had taken shelter in the al-Aqsa Mosque. He was killed by the Turkish Seljuks in 1078, establishing Seljuk rule over the city, which lasted until the Fatimids regained control in 1098.\n\nCrusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods\nJerusalem was captured by the Crusaders in 1099, during the First Crusade. They named the mosque Templum Solomonis (Solomon's Temple), distinguishing it from the Dome of the Rock, which they named Templum Domini (Temple of God). While the Dome of the Rock was turned into a Christian church under the care of the Augustinians, the al-Aqsa Mosque was used as a royal palace and also as a stable for horses. In 1119, the Crusader king accommodated the headquarters of the Knights Templar next to his palace within the building. During this period, the mosque underwent some structural changes, including the expansion of its northern porch, and the addition of an apse and a dividing wall. A new cloister and church were also built at the site, along with various other structures. The Templars constructed vaulted western and eastern annexes to the building; the western currently serves as the women's mosque and the eastern as the Islamic Museum.\nAfter the Ayyubids under the leadership of Saladin reconquered Jerusalem following the siege of 1187, several repairs and renovations were undertaken at al-Aqsa Mosque. In order to prepare the mosque for Friday prayers, within a week of his capture of Jerusalem Saladin had the toilets and grain stores installed by the Crusaders at al-Aqsa removed, the floors covered with precious carpets, and its interior scented with rosewater and incense. Saladin's predecessor—the Zengid sultan Nur al-Din—had commissioned the construction of a new minbar or \"pulpit\" made of ivory and wood in 1168–69, but it was completed after his death; Nur ad-Din's minbar was added to the mosque in November 1187 by Saladin. The Ayyubid sultan of Damascus, al-Mu'azzam, built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates in 1218. In 1345, the Mamluk sultan al-Kamil Sha'ban added two naves and two gates to the mosque's eastern side.\n\nOttoman/modern period\nAfter the Ottomans assumed power in 1517, they did not undertake any major renovations or repairs to the mosque. They made architectural contributions elsewhere on the Haram, including building the Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527) and three free-standing domes—the most notable being the Dome of the Prophet built in 1538, and restoring the Pool of Raranj. These constructions were commissioned by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem, rather than the sultans, whose contributions were limited to additions to the existing minarets.\nIn 1816, the mosque was restored by Sulayman Pasha al-Adil, the Acre-based governor of Sidon, after having been in a dilapidated state.\nThe first renovation in the 20th century occurred in 1922, when the Supreme Muslim Council under Amin al-Husayni (the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) commissioned Turkish architect Ahmet Kemalettin Bey to restore al-Aqsa Mosque and the monuments in its precincts. The council also commissioned British architects, Egyptian engineering experts and local officials to contribute to and oversee the repairs and additions which were carried out in 1924–25 by Kemalettin. The renovations included reinforcing the mosque's ancient Umayyad foundations, rectifying the interior columns, replacing the beams, erecting a scaffolding, conserving the arches and drum of the main dome's interior, rebuilding the southern wall, and replacing timber in the central nave with a slab of concrete. The renovations also revealed Fatimid-era mosaics and inscriptions on the interior arches that had been covered with plasterwork. The arches were decorated with gold and green-tinted gypsum and their timber tie beams were replaced with brass. A quarter of the stained glass windows also were carefully renewed so as to preserve their original Abbasid and Fatimid designs.\nSevere damage was caused by the 1837 and 1927 earthquakes. The damage from the 1927 earthquake and a small tremor in the summer of 1937 caused the roof of the mosque to collapse. Repairs were undertaken in 1938 and 1942. The upper part of the north wall of the mosque was reconstructed and the whole interior of the roofing was refaced. Other repairs included the partial reconstruction of the jambs and lintels of the central doors, the refacing of the front of five bays of the porch, and the demolition of the vaulted buildings that formerly adjoined the east side of the mosque. Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini donated Carrara marble columns in the late 1930s.\nOn 20 July 1951, King Abdullah I was shot three times by a Palestinian gunman as he entered the mosque, killing him. His grandson Prince Hussein, was at his side and was also hit, though a medal he was wearing on his chest deflected the bullet.\n\nThe site fell under Israeli control on 7 June 1967, during the Six Day War.\nOn 21 August 1969, a fire was started by a visitor from Australia named Denis Michael Rohan, an evangelical Christian who hoped that by burning down al-Aqsa Mosque he would hasten the Second Coming of Jesus. In response to the incident, a summit of Islamic countries was held in Rabat that same year, hosted by Faisal of Saudi Arabia, the then king of Saudi Arabia. The al-Aqsa fire is regarded as one of the catalysts for the formation of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC, now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) in 1972.\nFollowing the fire, the dome was reconstructed in concrete and covered with anodized aluminium, instead of the original ribbed lead enamel work sheeting. In 1983, the aluminium outer covering was replaced with lead to match the original design by az-Zahir.\nIn the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both members of the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted to blow up the al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion believed that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque.\nOn 5 November 2014, Israeli police entered Al-Aqsa for the first time since capturing Jerusalem in 1967, said Sheikh Azzam Al-Khatib, director of the Islamic Waqf. Previous media reports of 'storming Al-Aqsa' referred to the Haram al-Sharif compound rather than the Al-Aqsa mosque itself.\n\nArchitecture\nThe rectangular al-Aqsa Mosque and its precincts cover 14.4 hectares (36 acres), although the mosque itself is about 1.1 acres (0.46 ha) in area and can hold up to 5,000 worshippers. It is 83 m (272 ft) long, 56 m (184 ft) wide. Unlike the Dome of the Rock, which reflects classical Byzantine architecture, the Aqsa Mosque is characteristic of early Islamic architecture.\n\nDome\nNothing remains of the original dome built by Abd al-Malik. The present-day dome mimicks that of az-Zahir, which consisted of wood plated with lead enamelwork, but which was destroyed by fire in 1969. Today it is made of concrete with lead sheeting.\nAl-Aqsa's dome is one of the few domes to be built in front of the mihrab during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, the others being the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus (715) and the Great Mosque of Sousse (850). The interior of the dome is painted with 14th-century-era decorations. During the 1969 burning, the paintings were assumed to be irreparably lost, but were completely reconstructed using the trateggio technique, a method that uses fine vertical lines to distinguish reconstructed areas from original ones.\n\nFacade and porch\nThe facade of the mosque was built in 1065 CE on the instructions of the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir Billah. It was crowned with a balustrade consisting of arcades and small columns. The Crusaders damaged the facade, but it was restored and renovated by the Ayyubids. One addition was the covering of the facade with tiles. The second-hand material of the facade's arches includes sculpted, ornamental material taken from Crusader structures in Jerusalem. The facade consists of fourteen stone arches, most of which are of a Romanesque style. The outer arches added by the Mamluks follow the same general design. The entrance to the mosque is through the facade's central arch.\nThe porch is located at the top of the facade. The central bays of the porch were built by the Knights Templar during the First Crusade, but Saladin's nephew al-Mu'azzam Isa ordered the construction of the porch itself in 1217.\n\nInterior\nThe al-Aqsa Mosque has seven aisles of hypostyle naves with several additional small halls to the west and east of the southern section of the building. There are 121 stained glass windows in the mosque from the Abbasid and Fatimid eras. About a fourth of them were restored in 1924. The spandrels of the arch opposite the main entrance include a mosaic decoration and inscription dating back to Fatimid period.\n\nThe mosque's interior is supported by 45 columns, 33 of which are white marble and 12 of stone. The column rows of the central aisles are heavy and stunted. The remaining four rows are better proportioned. The capitals of the columns are of four different kinds: those in the central aisle are heavy and primitively designed, while those under the dome are of the Corinthian order, and made from Italian white marble. The capitals in the eastern aisle are of a heavy basket-shaped design and those east and west of the dome are also basket-shaped, but smaller and better proportioned. The columns and piers are connected by an architectural rave, which consists of beams of roughly squared timber enclosed in a wooden casing.\nA great portion of the mosque is covered with whitewash, but the drum of the dome and the walls immediately beneath it are decorated with mosaics and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927. The ceiling of the mosque was painted with funding by King Farouk of Egypt.\n\nMinbar\nThe minbar of the mosque was built by a craftsman named Akhtarini from Aleppo on the orders of the Zengid sultan Nur ad-Din. It was intended to be a gift for the mosque when Nur ad-Din would capture Jerusalem from the Crusaders and took six years to build (1168–74). Nur ad-Din died and the Crusaders still controlled Jerusalem, but in 1187, Saladin captured the city and the minbar was installed. The structure was made of ivory and carefully crafted wood. Arabic calligraphy, geometrical and floral designs were inscribed in the woodwork.\nAfter its destruction by Rohan in 1969, it was replaced by a much simpler minbar. In January 2007, Adnan al-Husayni—head of the Islamic waqf in charge of al-Aqsa—stated that a new minbar would be installed; it was installed in February 2007. The design of the new minbar was drawn by Jamil Badran based on an exact replica of the Saladin Minbar and was finished by Badran within a period of five years. The minbar itself was built in Jordan over a period of four years and the craftsmen used \"ancient woodworking methods, joining the pieces with pegs instead of nails, but employed computer images to design the pulpit [minbar].\"\n\nCurrent situation\nAdministration\nThe administrative body responsible for the whole Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is known as \"the Jerusalem Waqf\", an organ of the Jordanian government.\nThe Jerusalem Waqf is responsible for administrative matters in the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Religious authority on the site, on the other hand, is the responsibility of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, appointed by the government of the State of Palestine.\nAfter the 1969 arson attack, the waqf employed architects, technicians and craftsmen in a committee that carry out regular maintenance operations. The Islamic Movement in Israel and the waqf have attempted to increase Muslim control of the Temple Mount as a way of countering Israeli policies and the escalating presence of Israeli security forces around the site since the Second Intifada. Some activities included refurbishing abandoned structures and renovating.\nOwnership of the al-Aqsa Mosque is a contentious issue in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. During the negotiations at the 2000 Camp David Summit, Palestinians demanded complete ownership of the mosque and other Islamic holy sites in East Jerusalem.\n\nAccess\nMuslims who are residents of Israel or visiting the country and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally allowed to enter the Temple Mount and pray at al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions. Due to security measures, the Israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex; the restrictions vary from time to time. At times, restrictions have prevented all men under 45, unmarried men under 50 and women under 45 from entering. Sometimes the restrictions are enforced on the occasion of Friday prayers, other times they are over an extended period of time. Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank. The Israeli government states that the restrictions are in place for security reasons.\nUntil 2000, non-Muslim visitors could enter the Aqsa Mosque by getting a ticket from the Waqf. That procedure ended when the Second Intifada began. Over two decades later, the Waqf still hopes negotiations between Israel and Jordan may result in allowing visitors to enter once again.\n\nExcavations\nSeveral excavations outside the Temple Mount took place following the 1967 War. In 1970, Israeli authorities commenced intensive excavations outside the walls next to the mosque on the southern and western sides. Palestinians believed that tunnels were being dug under the Aqsa Mosque in order to undermine its foundations, which was denied by Israelis, who claimed that the closest excavation to the mosque was some 70 meters (230 ft) to its south. The Archaeological Department of the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs dug a tunnel near the western portion of the mosque in 1984. According to UNESCO's special envoy to Jerusalem Oleg Grabar, buildings and structures on the Temple Mount are deteriorating due mostly to disputes between the Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian governments over who is actually responsible for the site.\nIn February 2007, the department started to excavate a site for archaeological remains in a location where the government wanted to rebuild a collapsed pedestrian bridge leading to the Mughrabi Gate, the only entrance for non-Muslims into the Temple Mount complex. This site was 60 meters (200 ft) away from the mosque. The excavations provoked anger throughout the Islamic world, and Israel was accused of trying to destroy the foundation of the mosque. Ismail Haniyeh—then Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority and Hamas leader—called on Palestinians to unite to protest the excavations, while Fatah said they would end their ceasefire with Israel. Israel denied all charges against them, calling them \"ludicrous\".\n\nConflicts\nIn April 2021, during both Passover and Ramadan, the site was a focus of tension between Israeli settlers and Palestinians. Jewish settlers broke an agreement between Israel and Jordan and performed prayers and read from the Torah inside the compound, an area normally off limits to non-Muslims. On 14 April, Israeli police entered the area and forcibly cut wires to speakers in minarets around the mosque, silencing the call to prayer, claiming the sound was interfering with an event by the Israeli president at the Western Wall. On 16 April, seventy thousand Muslims prayed in the compound around the mosque, the largest gathering since the beginning of the COVID pandemic; police barred most from entering the structure itself. In May 2021, hundreds of Palestinians were injured following clashes in the compound after reports of Israel's intention to proceed to evict Palestinians from land claimed by Israeli settlers.\nOn 15 April 2022, Israeli forces entered the Temple Mount and used tear gas shells and sound bombs to disperse Palestinians who, they said, were throwing stones at policemen. Some Palestinians barricaded themselves inside the Al-Aqsa mosque, where they were detained by Israeli police. Over 150 people ended up injured and 400 arrested.\nOn April 5, 2023, Israeli police raided the temple, saying \"agitators\" who had thrown stones and fired fireworks at the police, had barricaded themselves and worshippers inside. Following the incident, militants fired rockets from Gaza into southern Israel.\nOn 22 April 2024 Israeli police arrested 13 for incitement to violence after they were caught in the act of smuggling goats onto the site for ritual sacrifice, 3 had been arrested in 2023 for trying to smuggle lambs and goats onto the site.\n\nSee also\nIslam in Israel\nList of mosques in Israel\nList of the oldest mosques in the world\nIslam in the Palestinian territories\nAl-Juʽranah in Saudi Arabia, alternative location for Quranic \"al-Aqsa mosque\"\nPalestinian nationalism – Movement for self-determination and sovereignty of Palestine\nReligious significance of the Syrian region – Region east of the Mediterranean SeaPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nAllan, J.

          "summary": "The Aqsa Mosque, also known as the Qibli Mosque or Qibli Chapel, is the main congregational mosque or prayer hall in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem. In some sources the building is also named al-Masjid al-Aqṣā, but this name primarily applies to the whole compound in which the building sits, which is itself also known as \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\". The wider compound is known as Al-Aqsa or Al-Aqsa mosque compound, also known as al-Ḥaram al-Sharīf.\nAccording to Islamic tradition, a small prayer hall (musalla), what would later become the Al-Aqsa Mosque, was built by Umar, the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. In the reign of the caliph Mu'awiyah I of the Umayyad Caliphate (founded in AD 661), a quadrangular mosque for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers is recorded somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif. \nThe present-day mosque, located on the south wall of the compound, was originally built by the fifth Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) or his successor al-Walid I (r. 705–715) (or both) as a congregational mosque on the same axis as the Dome of the Rock, a commemorative Islamic monument. After being destroyed in an earthquake in 746, the mosque was rebuilt in 758 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. It was further expanded upon in 780 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi, after which it consisted of fifteen aisles and a central dome. However, it was again destroyed during the 1033 Jordan Rift Valley earthquake. The mosque was rebuilt by the Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021–1036), who reduced it to seven aisles but adorned its interior with an elaborate central archway covered in vegetal mosaics; the current structure preserves the 11th-century outline.\nDuring the periodic renovations undertaken, the ruling Islamic dynasties constructed additions to the mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, façade, minarets, and minbar and interior structure. Upon its capture by the Crusaders in 1099, the mosque was used as a palace; it was also the headquarters of the religious order of the Knights Templar. After the area was conquered by Saladin in 1187, the structure's function as a mosque was restored. More renovations, repairs, and expansion projects were undertaken in later centuries by the Ayyubids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council of British Palestine, and during the Jordanian rule of the West Bank. Since the beginning of the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the mosque has remained under the independent administration of the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.",

يقع داخل البلده القديمه بالقدس في فلسطين. وهو كامل المنطقه المحاطه بالسور واسم لكل ما هو داخل سور المسجد الاقصى الواقع في اقصى الزاويه الجنوبيه الشرقيه من البلده القديمه المسوره.\nتبلغ مساحته قرابه 144000 متر مربع، ويشمل قبه الصخره والمسجد القِبْلي والمصلى المرواني ومصلى باب الرحمه، وعده معالم اخرى يصل عددها الى 200 معلمًا. ويقع المسجد الاقصى فوق هضبه صغيره تُسمى «هضبه موريا»، وتعد الصخره اعلى نقطه فيه، وتقع في قلبه.\nذُكر المسجد الاقصى في القران: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي اَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ اِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْاَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ايَاتِنَا اِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾ [الاسراء:1] (1).\nيُقدّس اليهود ايضًا المكان نفسه، ويطلقون على ساحات المسجد الاقصى اسمَ «جبل الهيكل» نسبه الى هيكل النبي سليمان، وتُحاول العديد من المنظمات اليهوديه التذرع بهذه الحجه لبناء الهيكل حسب مُعتقدها.\n\nاصل التسميه\nللمسجد الاقصى عده اسماء، اهمّها ثلاثه:\n\nالمسجد الاقصى: وكلمه «الاقصى» تعني الابعد، وسُمِّيَ الاقصَى لبعد ما بينه وبين المسجد الحرام، وكان ابعد مسجد عن اهل مكه في الارض يعظَّم بالزياره. والذي سمّاه بهذا الاسم وفقًا للعقيده الاسلاميه الله في القران، وذلك في الايه: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي اَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ اِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْاَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ايَاتِنَا اِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾ [الاسراء:1] (1)، كُتبت فيه الالفُ الاخيره ممدودهً الاقصا، وهو اسم تفضيل معناه الابعد، ثم صار يُقصد به الوصف لا التفضيل، وفي الاسم اعلال اذ اصلها الاقصَي بالياء المنقوطه، ثم اصبحت الياء الفاً لان ما قبلها حرف الصاد مفتوح، واصل الف الاقصى واو او ياء، اما قصِيَ يقصو، او قصا يقصو.\nالبيت المُقَدَّس: وكلمه «المقدّس» تعني المبارك والمطهّر، وقد ذكر علماءُ المسلمين وشعراؤهم هذا الاسم كثيرًا، كما قال الامام ابن حجر العسقلاني:\n\nبيت المَقْدِس: وهو الاسم الذي كان متعارفًا عليه قبل ان يُطلق عليه اسم «المسجد الاقصى» في القران الكريم، وهذا الاسم هو المستَخدَم في معظم احاديث النبي محمد، مثل ما قاله يوم الاسراء والمعراج: «ثم دخلت انا وجبريل عليه السلام بيت المقدس فصلى كل واحد منا ركعتين».\n\nاعتقادات خاطئه عن حدوده بسبب الاحتلال\nيعتقد الكثيرون ان المسجد الاقصى هو فقط المصلى المبني جنوبي قبه الصخره (المصلى القبلي)، وهو الذي تقام فيه الصلوات الخمس الان للرجال، وهذا الاعتقاد نتيجه محاولات الاحتلال الاسرائيلي الصهيوني السيطره على اجزاء من الاقصى او تدميره، والصحيح ان المسجد الاقصى هو اسم لجميع المسجد وهو كل ما هو داخل سور المسجد ويشمل الساحات الواسعه، والجامع القبلي وقبه الصخره والمصلى المرواني ومصلى باب الرحمه والاروقه والقباب والمصاطب واسبله الماء والحدائق وتحت ارض المسجد وفوقه وغيرها من المعالم، وعلى اسواره الماذن، والمسجد كله غير مسقّف سوى بناء قبه الصخره والمصلى القبلي الجامع والمصلى المرواني. وهذا ما اتفق عليه العلماء والمؤرخون، وعليه تكون مضاعفه ثواب الصلاه في اي جزء مما دار عليه السور، وتبلغ مساحته تقريباً 144000 متراً مربعاً.\n\nتاريخ المسجد الاقصى\nاول بنائه\nلا يُعرف بدقه متى بُني المسجد الاقصى لاول مره، ولكن ورد في احاديث النبي محمد بان بناءه كان بعد بناء الكعبه باربعين عامًا، فعن ابي ذر انه قال: «قلت: يا رسول الله! اي مسجد وضع في الارض اول؟ قال: المسجد الحرام. قلت: ثم اي؟ قال: المسجد الاقصى. قلت: كم بينهما؟ قال: اربعون سنه». وقد اختلف المؤرخون في مساله الباني الاول للمسجد الاقصى على عده اقوال: انهم الملائكه، او النبي ادم ابو البشر، او ابنه شيث، او سام بن نوح، او النبي ابراهيم، ويرجع الاختلاف في ذلك الى الاختلاف في الباني الاول للكعبه، وقد رجّح الباحث عبد الله معروف بان ادم هو من بنى المسجد الاقصى البناء الاول، لروايه عن ابن عباس، ولترجيح ان يكون ادم هو الباني للكعبه، كما رجّحه الامام ابن حجر العسقلاني في كتابه فتح الباري. ويُرجّح عبد الله معروف ان يكون البناء الاول للمسجد الاقصى قد اقتصر على وضع حدوده وتحديد مساحته التي تتراوح ما بين 142 و144 دونماً.\n\nعهد اليبوسيين وبني اسرائيل\nاما من بعد عهد ادم، فقد انقطعت اخبار المسجد لانعدام التاريخ في تلك الفتره، الى ان سُجلت معلومات تاريخيه عن اول مجموعه من البشر قدمت الى مدينه القدس وسكنتها، وهم اليبوسيون (3000 - 1550 ق.م) قبيله كنعانيه، وهم الذين بنوا مدينه القدس واسموها \"اور شليم (مدينه السلام)، حتى ان بقايا الاثار اليبوسيه ما تزال باقيه في سور المسجد الاقصى بحسب راي بعض الباحثين. وفي تلك الفتره، هاجر النبي ابراهيم الى مدينه القدس، وعمّر المسجد وصلّى فيه، وكذلك ابنه اسحق وحفيده يعقوب من بعده.\nوبعد ذلك ال امر مدينه القدس والمسجد الاقصى الى الفراعنه (1550 - 1000 ق.م)، ثم استولى عليها لاحقًا «القوم العمالقه»، ثم فتح المدينه النبي داود ومعه بنو اسرائيل عام 995 ق.م، فَوُسْع المدينه وعمّر المسجد الاقصى. ثم استلم الحكم ابنه سليمان، فعمّر المسجد وجدّده مره اخرى، ويروي النبي محمد ذلك فيقول: «لِمَا فرغ سُليمانُ بنُ داودَ عليهما اَلسَّلَام من بناءِ بيتِ المقدسِ سال اللهَ عَزَّ وَجِلَ ثلاثًا ان يُؤتيَه حُكمًا يُصادِفُ حُكمَه ومُلكًا لا ينبغي لاحدٍ من بعدِه وَاَنَّهُ لا ياتي هذا المسجدَ احدٌ لا يُريدُ اِلَّا اَلصَّلَاه فيه الَّا خرج من ذنوبِه كيومِ ولدَتْه اُمّه» فقال النبي محمد: «اما اثنتيْن فقد اُعْطِيهما وارجو ان يكونَ قد اُعْطِي اَلثَّالِثَه»، وهذا البناء لسليمان هو الذي يقول اليهود بنسبته اليهم، ويطلقون عليه اسم «هيكل سليمان». وبوفاه النبي سليمان، انتهى حكم بني اسرائيل الذي دام 80 عامًا.\n\nعهد الهياكل\nبعد وفاه سليمان، انقسمت دوله بني اسرائيل الى «مملكه اسرائيل» في الشمال، و«مملكه يهوذا» في الجنوب ومعها القدس، وما لبثت ان هاجمها البابليون واحرقوا الهيكل، وسبوا اليهود الى بابل فيما عُرْف بالسبي البابلي. بعد ذلك هزم الفرس البابليين، وسمح الملك الفارسي قورش الكبير عام 538 ق.م لمن اراد من اسرى اليهود في بابل بالعوده الى القدس واعاده بناء الهيكل المهدم، فعاد عدد من اليهود الى القدس وشرعوا في بناء الهيكل الثاني، وانتهوا من العمل به سنه 516 ق.م، في عهد الملك الفارسي دارا الاول، وعُرف فيما بعد بمعبد حيرود تيمنًا بملك اليهود حيرود الكبير الذي قام بتوسيعه.\n\nعهد الرومان والبيزنطيين\nاحتلّ الاغريق اراضي فلسطين، وخضعت للاسكندر المقدوني (حوالي عام 332 ق.م)، ثم لخلفائه البطالمه، ثم للسلوقيين، ولم تلبث المدينه حتى خضعت لحكم الامبراطوريه الرومانيه، وكان من اوائل الحكام وابرزهم الذين عينهم الرومان لحكم القدس الحاكم هيرودس (حوالي عام 37 ق.م)، وقد قام بتجديد بناء البيت المقدس (حوالي عام 20 ق.م)، كما اقام قلعه عظيمه بباب الخليل (يطلق عليها اليهود الان اسم «قلعه داود»). وفي تلك الفتره تذكر المصادر الاسلاميه بعثه النبي عيسى بن مريم، وزكريا وابنه يحيى بن زكريا الى بني اسرائيل في القدس، حيث كان يحيى يعِظُهم داخل المسجد الاقصى، كما يفيد الحديث النبوي: «فجمع يحيى بن زكريا بني اسرائيل في بيت المقدس حتى امتلا المسجد فقعد على الشرف فحمد الله واثنى عليه ثم قال ان الله امرني بخمس كلمات ان اعمل بهن وامركم ان تعملوا بهن..»، كما يذكر الانجيل الذي بين ايدي النصارى اليوم ان عيسى بن مريم انكر على بني اسرائيل انحرافهم عن عباده الله تعالى داخل المسجد الاقصى، وتحويلهم اياه الى مكان للبيع والشراء.\nوبعد النبي عيسى بن مريم بحوالي 300 عام، انقسمت الامبراطوريه الرومانيه الى الامبراطوريه الرومانيه الغربيه في الغرب، والامبراطوريه البيزنطيه في الشرق، وبقيت الامبراطوريه البيزنطيه هي المُسيطره على القدس، فاصبحت القدس مدينه نصرانيه، وبنوا فيها كنيسه القيامه. اما المسجد الاقصى فبقي متروكًا كما هو دون بناء. وفي عام 614 احتل الفرس مدينه القدس بمعاونه اليهود، وذلك بعد حرب طويله ضد البيزنطيين الروم، وقد وقع ذلك في الفتره التي بُعث فيها النبي محمد في مكه، اذ يذكر القران قصه الحروب في سوره الروم: ﴿غُلِبَتِ الرُّومُ ۝٢ فِي اَدْنَى الْاَرْضِ وَهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ غَلَبِهِمْ سَيَغْلِبُونَ ۝٣﴾ [الروم:2–3].(2) وما لبث ان عاد البيزنطيون الروم الى الحكم عام 624، وفي تلك الفتره اصبحت ارض المسجد الاقصى مكبًا للنّفايات، وذلك انتقامًا من اليهود، اذ كانت الصخره المُشرفه قبله لهم.\n\nعهد النبي محمد\nكانت هناك اهميّه خاصه للمسجد الاقصى في عهد النبي محمد، اذ كان القبله الاولى للمسلمين بعد هجره النبي محمد الى المدينه المنوره عام 1 هـ الموافق 622م، فقد كان المسلمون يتوجّهون الى المسجد الاقصى في صلواتهم، ومكثوا على ذلك مده 16 شهرًا تقريبًا. فقد روى البراء بن عازب انه قال: «لما قَدِمَ النَّبيُ صلى الله عليه وسلم المدينهَ صلّى نَحوَ بيتِ المقدسِ سِتهَ عَشرَ شهرًا او سبعهَ عَشرَ شهرًا، وكان يُحبُ انْ يُوَجِّهِ الى الكَعبهِ، فانزل اللّه  ﴿قَدْ نَرَى تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي السَّمَاءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَهً تَرْضَاهَا فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ وَاِنَّ الَّذِينَ اُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ اَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ ۝١٤٤﴾ [البقره:144] (3).».\nوكان المسجد الاقصى وجهه النبي محمد في الرحله المعجزه المعروفه باسم الاسراء والمعراج، وذلك ليله 27 رجب بعد البعثه بعشر سنين (3 ق هـ)، اذ يؤمن المسلمون ان النبيَّ محمدًا خرج من المسجد الحرام بصحبه المَلَك جبريل راكبًا دابّه البراق، فنزل في المسجد الاقصى وربط البُراق بحلقه باب المسجد عند حائط البراق، وصلّى بجميع الانبياء امامًا، ثم عُرج به من الصخره المشرّفه الى فوق سبع سماوات مارًا بالانبياء: ادم ويحيى بن زكريا وعيسى بن مريم ويوسف وادريس وهارون وموسى وابراهيم.\n\nالفتح الاسلامي\nعندما تولّى الخليفه ابو بكر الصديق خلافه المسلمين خلفاً للنبي محمد، قام بتسيير جيش اسامه بن زيد لفتح بلاد الشام عامّه ونشر الدعوه الاسلاميه فيها، وقد كان النبي محمد قد جهّز جيش اسامه قبل وفاته، وما لبث ان تُوفي ابو بكر الصديق، فتولّى عمر بن الخطاب الخلافه، فكان اوّل ما فعله ان ولّى ابا عبيده بن الجراح قياده الجيش الفاتح لبلاد الشام بدلاً من خالد بن الوليد، فوصل ابو عبيده بن الجراح الى مدينه القدس (وكانت تُسمى «ايلياء»)، فاستعصت عليهم ولم يتمكنوا من فتحها لمناعه اسوارها، حيث اعتصم اهلها داخل الاسوار، فحاصرهم حتى تعبوا وارسلوا يطلبون الصلحَ وتسليم المدينه بلا قتال، واشترطوا ان ياتي خليفه المسلمين بنفسه الى القدس ليتسلّم مفاتيحها منهم، فخرج عمر بن الخطاب من المدينه المنوره حتى وصل القدس، وذلك عام 15 هـ الموافق 636م، واعطى اهلها الامن وكتب لهم العهده العمريه. وقد صحبه البطريرك «صفرونيوس» فزار كنيسه القيامه، ومن ثم اوصله الى المسجد الاقصى، فلمّا دخله قال: «الله اكبر، هذا المسجد الذي وصفه لنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم»، وكان في تلك الايام هضبه خاليه في قلبها الصخره المشرفه، ثم امر الخليفه عمر بن الخطاب ببناء المصلّى الرئيسي الذي سيكون مكان الصلاه الرئيسي في المسجد الاقصى، وهو موقع «الجامع القبلي» اليوم، ويقع في الجنوب في جهه القبله، وكان المسجد في عهده خشبيًّا يتّسع لحوالي 1000 شخص، وبقي على حاله الى زمن الخليفه الاموي معاويه بن ابي سفيان.\n\nالعهد الاموي\nبعد قيام الدوله الامويه في عام 41 هـ الموافق 661 على يد معاويه بن ابي سفيان، قام بتجديد بناء المسجد القبلي داخل المسجد الاقصى الذي بناه عمر بن الخطاب، فجعل من الحجر بدلاً من الخشب، ووسّعه ليسع 3000 مصلٍ. وقد ذكر بعض المؤرخين المسلمين في مذكراتهم مثل مجير الدين والمقدسي والسيوطي ان اوسع حركه تعمير للمسجد تمت في عهد الخليفه عبد الملك بن مروان منذ عام 65 هـ الموافق 685 جنبا الى جنب مع قبه الصخره، وتواصلت في عهد ابنه الوليد بن عبد الملك حتى عام 96 هـ الموافق 715. حيث بدا البناء الاموي للمسجد الاقصى ببناء قبه الصخره وهي قبه ذهبيه فوق الصخره المشرفه الواقعه في قلب الاقصى (في منتصف المسجد اقرب الى الغرب قليلا)، والتي تمثل اعلى نقطه في جبل البيت المقدس، ويعتقد ان معراج النبي محمد الى السماء تم منها، لتكون قبه للمسجد كاملاً. وقبل الشروع ببنائها، اقيمت بجانبها قبه صغيره في منتصف المسجد الاقصى تماماً، عُرفت بـ «قبه السلسله»، لتكون مقراً للمشرفين على البناء للاقصى، وخزانه لجمع الاموال اللازمه لذلك، وقيل لتكون نموذجاً لقبه الصخره.\n\nالزلزال واعاده البناء\nفي عام 746م، تعرض المسجد الاقصى الى زلزال ادى الى تدميره، وبعد اربع سنوات اطاح السفاح بالخلافه الامويه، وانشا الخلافه العباسيه عام 750م. وبعد اربع سنوات توفي السفاح بعد ان عهد بالخلافه لاخيه ابو جعفر المنصور، وقد اعلن المنصور نيته لاصلاح المسجد، وقال انه لويحات الذهب والفضه التي غطت بوابات المسجد يجب ازالتها وتحولت الى دينار ودرهم لتمويل اعاده الاعمار التي انتهت في عام 771م. وفي عام 774م، ضرب زلزال ثاني المسجد ادى الى تدمير معظم اصلاحات المنصور، باستثناء تلك التي في الجزء الجنوبي من المسجد. وفي عام 780م، اعيد بناء المسجد في عهد الخليفه محمد المهدي الذي امر ببنائه فانقص من طوله وزيد في عرضه وفي عام 985، اشار الجغرافي المقدسي ان المسجد الذي تم تجديده كان يضم «خمسه عشر رواق وخمسه عشر باب».\n\nفي عام 1033م، تعرض المسجد لاضرار بليغه بسبب وقوع زلزال اخر. وفي عهد الخليفه الفاطمي الظاهر تم اصلاح الاضرار، وتجديد المسجد بين عامي 1034 و1036م. وتم تخفيض عدد الاروقه جذريا من خمسه عشر الى سبعه. وفي عهد الظاهر بنيت الاروقه الاربعه من القاعه المركزيه والممر الذي يستخدم حاليا كاساس للمسجد. وقد كان الممر المركز ضعف عرض الممرات الاخرى، وقد وصف الجغرافي الفارسي ناصر بن خسرو المسجد الاقصى خلال زيارته له عام 1047م:\n\n.\n\nالحمله الصّليبيّه\nفي عام 1099م، سيطر الصليبيون على القدس، اثناء الحمله الصليبيه الاولى. وبدلا من تدمير المسجد اطلقوا عليه اسم معبد سليمان، وقد استخدمه الصليبيون اولًا كقصر ملكي واسطبل للخيول. وفي عام 1119م، تم تحويله الى مقر لفرسان الهيكل. وخلال هذه الفتره، خضع المسجد الى بعض التغييرات الهيكليه، بما في ذلك توسيع الشرفه الشماليه، واضافه حنيه (محراب الكنيسه) وجدار فاصل. وقد تم بناء دير جديد وكنيسه ايضًا في الموقع، جنبًا الى جنب مع غيرها من الهياكل المختلفه وقد شيد فرسان المعبد اقباء ومرفقاتها في الجهه الغربيه والشرقيه للمبنى؛ ويستعمل القبو الغربي حاليًا كمسجد للنساء اما الشرقي فيستخدم كمتحف اسلامي.\nبعد حصار 1187م استطاع صلاح الدين الايوبي باستعاده القدس من يد الصليبيين، واجريت العديد من الاصلاحات والتجديدات في المسجد الاقصى. من اجل اعداد المسجد لاداء صلاه الجمعه، وفي غضون اسبوع من استعاده صلاح الدين للقدس تم ازاله المراحيض ومخازن الحبوب المثبته من قبل الصليبيين في الاقصى، وقد تم ايضا ازاله الارضيات المغطاه بالسجاد الثمين، وباطنها المعطر بماء الورد والبخور، وقد كلف نور الدين الزنكي، ببناء منبر جديد مصنوع من العاج والخشب في 1168-1169م، ولكن تم الانتهاء منه بعد وفاته، وقد قام صلاح الدين باضافه منبر نور الدين زنكي الى المسجد في نوفمبر 1187م، وفي عام 1218م، تم تشييد الرواق الشمالي للمسجد مع ثلاث بوابات في عهد المعظم السلطان الايوبي لدمشق، وفي عام 1345م، تم اضافه اضاف اثنين من البلاطات وبوابتين على الجانب الشرقي للمسجد، بامر من السلطان المملوكي الكامل سيف الدين شعبان ابن قلاوون.\nوبعد وصول العثمانيين الى السلطه في 1517م، لم يقوموا باي تجديدات او اصلاحات للمسجد نفسه، لكن قاموا ببعض الاضافات للحرم الشريف ككل. وشمل ذلك بناء نافوره قاسم باشا عام 1527م، وتم ترميم بركه الرارانج، وبناء ثلاث قباب قائمه بذاتها، وابرزها قبه النبي التي بنيت في عام 1538م. وقد اهتم الولاه العثمانيين في القدس بالمسجد كثيرا وجعلوه في مقدمه اولياتهم.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nالتجديد الاول للمسجد الاقصى في القرن العشرين حدث في عام 1922، عندما كلف المجلس الاسلامي الاعلى تحت امين الحسيني (مفتي القدس الكبرى) المهندس المعماري التركي احمد كيماليتين استعاده المسجد الاقصى والمعالم الاثريه في ساحاته. كما ان المجلس ايضا قام بتكليف المهندسين المعماريين البريطانيين وخبراء مصريين والمسؤولين المحليين للمساهمه والاشراف على الاصلاحات والاضافات التي نفذها كيماليتين مابين 1924–1925. وقد شملت التجديدات تعزيز الاسس الامويه القديمه للمسجد، وتصحيح الاعمده الداخليه، لتحل محل العوارض ونصب السقالات، وشملت ايضا التجديدات ترميم الاقواس والمنطقه الداخليه للقبه الرئيسيه وكيفيه الحفاظ عليها، وقد تم اعاده بناء الجدار الجنوبي، واستبدال الاخشاب في الصحن المركزي بكتله من الخرسانه. وكشفت التجديدات ايضا عن فسيفساء تعود الى العصر الفاطمي، وايضا اكتشف وجود نقوش على الاقواس الداخليه التي كانت مغطاه بالجبس. وقد زينت الاقواس بالذهب والجص الاخضر ملون واستبدلت الاخشاب بالنحاس. وجدد ربع نوافذ الزجاج المعشق ايضا بعنايه شديده حفاظا على تصاميمهم العباسيه والفاطميه الاصليه، وقد تعرض المسجد الاقصى لاضرار شديده بسبب وقوع زلازل ما بين 1927 و1937، وقد تم اصلاح الاضرار التي لحقت بالمسجد في عام 1938 و1942.\n\nحريق المسجد\nتعرض في صبيحه يوم الخميس الموافق 22 اغسطس 1969م لحريق على يد يهودي استرالي متطرف اسمه مايكل دينس روهن، حيث تم حرق الجامع القبلي الذي سقط سقف قسمه الشرقي بالكامل، كما احترق منبر صلاح الدين، الذي امر ببنائه نور الدين زنكي قبل تحرير المسجد الاقصى من الصليبيين وقام (صلاح الدين الايوبي) بوضعه داخل المسجد بعد التحرير، وقد قال روهن تعقيبا على الحريق الذي افتعله انه كان يامل من احراق المسجد الاقصى كان من شانه ان يعجل المجيء الثاني للمسيح، مما يجعل الطريق لاعاده بناء الهيكل اليهودي المزعوم على جبل الهيكل. وادخل روهن الى مصحه الامراض العقليه، وردا على الحادث، تم عقد قمه للدول الاسلاميه في الرباط في العام نفسه، الذي استضافه الملك فيصل. ويعتبر حريق الاقصى احد العوامل المحفزه لتشكيل منظمه المؤتمر الاسلامي (والان منظمه التعاون الاسلامي)، وفي عام 1972، تم ترميم المسجد الاقصى والمنبر معه، وتتولى الاردن ترميم واصلاح المسجدين على نفقتها الخاصه كلما دعا الامر لذلك.\nفي الثمانينيات من القرن الماضي، تامر بن شوشان ويهودا اتزيون وكلاهما عضو في منظمه غوش ايمونيم السريه، لتفجير المسجد الاقصى وقبه الصخره. اما اتزيون فقد كان يعتقد ان تفجير اثنين من المساجد سوف يتسبب بصحوه روحيه في الكيان الصهيوني، وسوف يحل جميع مشاكل اليهود. كما اعرب كل من بن شونان واتزينون عن املهم في بناء المعبد الثالث في القدس وتحديداً في موقع المسجد الاقصى. وفي 15 يناير 1988، خلال الانتفاضه الاولى، اطلقت القوات الصهيونيه الرصاص المطاطي والغاز المسيل للدموع على المتظاهرين خارج المسجد، مما ادى الى اصابه 40 من المصلين. وفي 8 اكتوبر 1990، قتل 22 فلسطينياً واصيب اكثر من 100 اخرين من «شرطه الحدود الصهيونيه» خلال الاحتجاجات التي تم تشغيلها بواسطه الاعلان عن «جبل الهيكل»، على يد مجموعه من اليهود المتدينين، الذين كانوا في طريقهم لوضع حجر الاساس للهيكل الثالث المزعوم.\n\nالقرن 21\nفي 28 سبتمبر 2000، قام ارئيل شارون واعضاء من حزب الليكود، جنبا الى جنب مع 1000 حارس مسلح، بزياره المسجد الاقصى، مما تسبب بمظاهره كبيره من الفلسطينيين احتجاجا على هذه الزياره، وبدا الفلسطينيون من الحرم القدسي برمي الحجاره على الشرطه الاسرائيليه. التي قامت باطلاق الغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي على الحشد مما اسفر عن مقتل اربعه واصابه حوالي 200 شخص، مما اسفر عن اصابه 24 شخصًا. وقد اثارت هذه الزياره انتفاضه لمده خمس سنوات على يد الفلسطينيين، ويُشار اليها باسم «انتفاضه الاقصى»، ويرى بعض المعلقين، نقلاً عن خطب لاحقه من قبل مسؤولين في السلطه الفلسطينيه، وخاصه عماد الفالوجي وعرفات نفسه، ان الانتفاضه كانت مخططه مسبقا قبل اشهر من هذه الزياره ، ربما في يوليو او تموز عند عوده ياسر عرفات من محادثات كامب ديفيد.\nومع اندلاع الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثالثه شدد الاحتلال الاسرائيلي القيود على دخول المسجد الاقصى من تحديد اعمار المصلين، فلا يسمح لمن هم دون الـ45 سنه من سكان الضفه الغربيه من دخول المسجد بدون تصاريح، حتى في اهم واقدس المناسبات الاسلاميه مثل شهر رمضان المبارك، اما بالنسبه لسكان قطاع غزه فلا يسمح الا لاعداد قليله من كبار السن ممن تتجاوز اعمارهم 50 سنه بدخول المسجد الاقصى وبتصاريح خاصه.\n\nقرار اليونيسكو سنه 2016\nفي يوم 14 اكتوبر 2016، اتخذت لجنه البرامج والعلاقات الخارجيه في المجلس التنفيذي لمنظمه اليونسكو قرارًا جاء فيه ان المنظمه تعتبر المسجد الاقصى احد المقدسات الاسلاميه، بدون ذكر وجود اي علاقه تاريخيه بين اليهود والمسجد، ومستنكره اقتحامه المتكرر من قبل بعض المتطرفين الاسرائيليين ومن قبل الجيش الاسرائيلي. وجاء هذا القرار استجابهً لمشروع تم تقديمه من قبل الجزائر ومصر ولبنان والمغرب وعمان وقطر والسودان. وقد رحبت عده منظمات وهيئات اسلاميه بالقرار وفي مقدمتها منظمه التعاون الاسلامي ومرصد الجامع الازهر، وهيئه علماء المسلمين في العراق، الى جانب الحكومه والفصائل الفلسطينيه. بالمقابل، قالت مصادر اسرائيليه ان الحكومه تسعى الى تليين قرار اليونيسكو سالف الذكر، وان اسرائيل تجري اتصالات دبلوماسيه حثيثه لتليين صيغه نص القرار. وقال محللين اخرين ايضًا ان هذا تاكيد دولي على ان القدس منطقه محتله، وعلى اسرائيل التفاوض بشانها.\n\nمنع الصلاه في المسجد سنه 2017\nفي يوم الجمعه 20 شوال 1438هـ الموافق فيه 14 يوليو 2017م، قالت الشرطه الاسرائيليه انها قررت منع صلاه الجمعه في المسجد الاقصى لهذا اليوم واغلاق ابوابه حتى اشعار اخر، وذلك في اعقاب عمليه اطلاق نار وقعت صباح نفس اليوم المذكور افضت الى استشهاد ثلاثه شبان فلسطينيين وقتل ثلاثه من افراد الشرطه الاسرائيليه بالقرب من باب الاسباط بالقدس. ونشرت الشرطه المذكوره تصريح مكتوب قالت فيه ان قائدها العام في القدس «يهورام هاليفي» قرر اغلاق ابواب المسجد، واعلانه منطقه عسكريه يمنع بموجبها على المصلين دخوله اضافه الى البلده القديمه في القدس، لتكون تلك المره الاولى التي تقفل فيها ابواب المسجد امام المصلين منذ سنه 1969م، وذلك في اليوم التالي لاقدام اليهودي المتطرف مايكل دينس روهن على محاوله احراق المسجد. بِالمُقابل قال مكتب رئيس الوزراء الاسرائيلي بنيامين نتنياهو ان الاغلاق هو ليوم واحد فقط. وعندما اُعلن هذا الامر، دعا المفتي العام للقدس والديار الفلسطينيه الشيخ محمد حسين الى شد الرحال للاقصى والتواجد على الحواجز وفي الساحات لاقامه صلاه الجمعه، وقال ان «لا قوه على وجه الارض ستمنعهم من التوجه للاقصى واقامه صلاه الجمعه فيه». بالمقابل شرعت منظمات واحزاب يهوديه بحمله تحريض واسعه بحق المسجد الاقصى والمصلين، عقب عمليه اطلاق النار سالِفه الذِكر، وقال عضو الكنيست من حزب البيت اليهودي «موتي يوغاف» الى اغلاق المسجد الاقصى بوجه المسلمين لفتره دائمه، وقالت منظمه جبل الهيكل الى الرد على عمليه القدس عبر زياده بناء المستوطنات اليهوديه وزياده ساعات الاقتحام للاقصى، كما قال نائب وزير الجيش الاسرائيلي، الحاخام ايلي بن دهان، انه يجب على اليهود ان يعززوا قبضتهم على المسجد الاقصى، وضمان ان يصلي كل يهودي فيه بامان وفي كل وقت.\n\nوفي يوم 22 شوال 1438هـ الموافق فيه 16 يوليو 2017م، نصبت السُلطات الاسرائيليه بوَّابات تفتيش الكترونيَّه على عدد من ابواب الاقصى في سبيل تعزيز اجراءاتها الامنيَّه، بِالاضافه الى كاميرات مُراقبه لِلاطلاع على ما يجري داخل باحات المسجد. ثُمَّ اعلن وزير الامن الداخلي الاسرائيلي جلعاد اردان افتتاح بابيّ الاسباط والمجلس المُؤديان الى المسجد، لكنَّهُ في نفس الوقت قال انَّ «اسرائيل هي صاحبه السياده في المسجد، وموقف الدُول الاُخرى ليس مهماً» وانَّ «اسرائيل اذا قررت فعل شيء في القدس ستُنفذه». وقد رفض موظفو الاوقاف الاسلاميَّه الدُخول الى المسجد ومُباشره اعمالهم احتجاجًا على هذه الخطوه الاسرائيليَّه. ايضًا رفض عامَّه الناس الانصياع للاجراءات الاسرائيليَّه ورفضوا دخول المسجد عبر هذه البوابات، وتجمهروا امام باب الاسباط لِاداء الصلاه، واعلنوا الاعتصام لِلحيلوله دون تحويل وضع المسجد الاقصى الى ما يشبه الوضع القائم في المسجد الابراهيمي بالخليل والابقاء على البوابات الالكترونيه بشكلٍ دائم. استمرَّ الوضع قائمًا على هذه الحال بضعه ايَّام، فتظاهر المقدسيُّون وتابعوا اعتصامهم امام ابواب المسجد الاقصى، وتخلل ذلك بعض الاشتباكات مع الشرطه الاسرائيليَّه، وفي يوم 4 ذي القعده 1438هـ الموافق فيه 27 يوليو 2017م اعلنت الشرطه الاسرائيليه ازاله كل الاجراءات الامنيه التي استحدثتها وعوده الوضع الى ما كان عليه قبل وقوع الهُجوم الذي ادى الى مقتل ثلاثه من افراد الشرطه، فعمَّت الاحتفالات مدينه القدس ابتهاجًا بفتح ابواب المسجد الاقصى، واقيمت الصلوات في مواعيدها المعتاده بداخل الحرم يومذاك. وبعد اعاده افتتاح المسجد ببضعه ايَّام، وتحديدًا يوم 8 ذي القعده 1438هـ، كشف رئيس مركز القدس الدولي حسن خاطر، ان السلطات الاسرائيليه صادرت وثائق مهمه كانت محفوظه بداخله، تتعلق باملاك واوقاف القدس واراضيها، وذلك اثناء فتره اغلاقه امام المسلمين. وحذَّر من كارثه كبيره تحوم حول الحرم القدسي نظرًا لان اسرائيل تمهد للتلاعب بالوثائق التي استولت عليها بهدف الحاق الضرر بالاوقاف، التي تشكل املاكها ما نسبته 90% من البلده القديمه، مقسمه بين عقارات واراضٍ ووقف اسلامي. بعد هذا الاكتشاف، شكَّلت دائره الاوقاف الاسلاميه بالقدس لجنه فنيه لحصر حجم المفقودات من الوثائق المسروقه للتحرك ضد اسرائيل.\n\nاقتحام المسجد الاقصى 2022\nفي صباح يوم الجمعه الموافق 15 ابريل 2022 قامت قوات الاحتلال الاسرائيلي باقتحام المسجد الاقصى، مستخدمهً قنابل الغاز المسيل للدموع والقنابل الصوتيه، مما ادى الى اصابه ما لا يقل عن 90 فلسطينياً بجروح.\n\nالعماره\nالمسجد الاقصى هو المنطقه المحاطه بالسور المستطيل الواقعه في جنوب شرق مدينه القدس المسوره والتي تعرف بالبلده القديمه. وتبلغ مساحه المسجد قرابه الـ 144 دونماً ويشمل قبه الصخره والمسجد الاقصى حسب الصوره المرفقه، وعده معالم اخرى يصل عددها الى 200 معلم. ويقع المسجد الاقصى فوق هضبه صغيره تسمى هضبه موريا وتعتبر الصخره هي اعلى نقطه في المسجد وتقع في موقع القلب بالنسبه للمسجد الاقصى الشريف.\nوتبلغ قياسات المسجد: من الجنوب 281 مترا ومن الشمال 310 امتار ومن الشرق 462 مترا ومن الغرب 491 مترا. وتشكل هذه المساحه سدس مساحه البلده القديمه، وهذه الحدود لم تتغير منذ وضع المسجد اول مره كمكان للصلاه بخلاف المسجد الحرام والمسجد النبوي اللذين تم توسعيهما عده مرات.\nوللمسجد الاقصى اربعه ماذن هي مئذنه باب المغاربه الواقعه الجنوب الغربي، مئذنه باب السلسله الواقعه في الجهه الغربيه قرب باب السلسله، مئذنه باب الغوانمه الواقعه في الشمال الغربي، ومئذنه باب الاسباط الواقعه في الجهه الشماليه.\n\nمعالم المسجد الاقصى\nالمصليات\nيتكون المسجد الاقصى من سبع مصليات او مساجد معمده مع عده قاعات صغيره اضافيه من الجهه الغربيه والشرقيه من الجزء الجنوبي من المسجد. وقد كان يوجد 121 نافذه من الزجاج الملون في المسجد من عصور الخلافه العباسيه والفاطميه. تم استعاده حوالي ربعهم في عام 1924.\nوالمساجد هي:\n\n1 - الجامع القِبلي\n\nوهو الجامع المسقوف الذي تعلوه قبّه رصاصيه، والواقع في جنوبيّ المسجد الاقصى في جهه القِبله، ومن هنا جاءت تسميته بـ «القِبلي». ويُعتبر هذا الجامع المصلّى الرئيس الذي يخطب فيه الخطيب في صلاه الجمعه، كما انّه يُعتبر المصلّى الرئيس للرجال داخل المسجد الاقصى حيث يقف الامام، وحيث يوجد المحراب والمنبر الرئيسان. والبناء الحالي يعود للعصر الاموي، حيث بَدا العمل على تجديد بناءه الخليفه عبد الملك بن مروان، واتمّه ابنه الخليفه الوليد بن عبد الملك بين عامي 86 هـ-96 هـ الموافق 705-714م، وكان في الاصل مكونًا من 15 رواقًا، ثم اًعيد ترميمه بعد تعرّضه لزلازل ادّت لتصدّعه، واختُصِرت اروقته في عصر الخليفه الفاطمي الظاهر لاعزاز دين الله الى 7 اروقه، وفي وقتنا الحالي يتكوّن من رواق كبير في الوسط و3 اروقه في كل جانب. وللجامع قبّه مرتفعه داخليه مصنوعه من الخشب، تعلوها القبّه الرئيسه الخارجيّه والمُغطّاه بالواح الرصاص. وتبلغ مساحه الجامع حوالي 4 دونمات، طوله 80م وعرضه 55م، على اختلاف يسير بين طول ضلعه الشرقي والغربي، وله 11 بابًا، ويتّسع الى حوالي 5500 مصلّ.\nوكان اوّل من بناه هو عمر بن الخطاب عند الفتح الاسلامي عام 15 هـ، وذلك بعد ان استشار كعب الاحبار في مكان بناء المسجد، فاشار عليه في مكان الصخره، فرفض ذلك عمر وقال: «بل نجعل قبلته صدره كما جعل رسول الله صَلَّى الله عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ قبله مساجدنا صدورنا»، وكان بناؤه من الخشب، وكان يتّسع حوالي 1000 مصلّ، ثمّ جدّده الخليفه معاويه بن ابي سفيان، فصار يتّسع حوالي 3000 مصلّ. وعندما سيطر الصليبيون على القدس قسّموا الجامع القبلي الى ثلاثه اقسام: احدها تحوّل الى مكاتب، والاخر الى سكن لفرسان المعبد، والثالث الى كنيسه، وبقي الامر كذلك حتى عهد صلاح الدين الايوبي فرمّم المسجد عام 538 هـ الموافق 1187، ثم توالت الترميمات في عصر الدوله المملوكيه والدوله العثمانيه لاحقًا. وفي العصر الحديث، وبعد احتلال اليهود لفلسطين، بقي الجامع القبلي تحت تهديد اليهود، فعمدوا الى اعمال حفر تحت اغلب الجدار الجنوبي للمسجد وتحت اساسات الجامع القبلي كلها مما هدّدت اساساته، كما تعرّض الجامع القبلي لحريق مفتعل وذلك يوم 21 اغسطس 1969 على يد مايكل دينس روهن، فاحترق منبر نور الدين زنكي، وامتد الحريق ليشمل اغلب الاروقه الثلاثه الشرقيه، بالاضافه الى سقفه الخشبي.\nوفي يناير 2007، ذكر عدنان الحسيني – رئيس دائره الاوقاف الاسلاميه والمسؤول عن كتائب شهداء – انه سيجري تركيب منبر جديد؛ وقد جرى تثبيته في فبراير 2007. كما ان تصميم المنبر الجديد هو من تصميم جمال بدران استناداً الى نسخه طبق الاصل من منبر صلاح الدين الايوبي، وقد عمل عليه بدران مده خمس سنوات. المنبر نفسه جرى بناؤه في الاردن في مده اربع سنوات، واستخدم الحرفيين اساليب النجاره القديمه لبنائه، واستعمل قطع من اوتاد بدلاً من المسامير لتثبيته.\n\n2 - المصلى المرواني\n\nويقع في اسفل الزاويه الجنوبيه الشرقيه للمسجد الاقصى، وكان يُعرَف قديمًا «بالتسويه الشرقيه»، وقد بناه الامويون كتسويه معماريه لهضبه بيت المقدس الاصليه المنحدره جهه الجنوب، حتى يتسنّى البناء فوق قسمها الجنوبيّ. ويتكوّن المصلّى المرواني من 16 رواقًا، وتبلغ مساحته الاجماليه اكثر من 4000 مترًا مربعًا، وهي اكبر مساحه مُغطاه للصلاه في المسجد الاقصى. عندما سيطر الصليبيون على المسجد الاقصى، قاموا بتحويل المصلّى المرواني الى اسطبلات للخيول، وسمّوه «اسطبلات سليمان»، وهي تسميّه توراتيه نسبهً الى النبي سليمان. وبعد تحرير المسجد الاقصى في عهد صلاح الدين الايوبي، اعاد المصلى المرواني الى استعماله السابق باعتباره تسويهً ومخزنًا. وبقي الامر كذلك حتى عام 1996، حيث تم افتتاحه كمُصلّى وسُمي يومئذٍ بالمُصلّى المرواني نسبهً الى عبد الملك بن مروان.\nوكان سبب افتتاحه كمُصلّى هو تسريب وثيقه سريّه لتقسيم المسجد الاقصى باعتبار ما تحت الارض لليهود وما فوق الارض للمسلمين وذلك في عام 1995، بعد ذلك قررت عده هيئات اسلاميه البدء بالعمل على فتح المصلّى المرواني، فبدات بتنظيف المكان، ومدّ الكهرباء اليه واضاءته، ثم تبليط المصلّى، وتبرعت مصر بفرش المصلّى، وتم فتح عدّه ابواب له. وكان هذا العمل الذي تم هو السبب المُعلَن للزياره التي قام بها ارئيل شارون للمسجد يوم الخميس 28 سبتمبر 2000، والتي ادّت لانطلاق انتفاضه الاقصى والتي استمرت 5 سنوات.\n3 - مصلى الاقصى القديم\n\nويقع هذا المصلّى تحت الجامع القبلي، يدخل اليه عبر درج يقع قرب الرواق الاوسط في الجهه الشماليه للجامع القبلي، وهو عباره عن ممر يتكون من رواقين باتجاه الجنوب بناه الامويون ليكون مدخلاً ملكيًا الى المسجد الاقصى من القصور الامويه التي تقع خارج حدود الاقصى من الجهه الجنوبيه. ويوجد عند المدخل الشمالي منه غرفه صغيره كانت تستخدم للحرس، كما يوجد غرفه اكبر تقع عند بقايا الباب المزدوج عند المدخل الجنوبي للمصلّى والتي كانت تستخدم للحرس ايضًا، وهي تحتوي على محراب في مدخلها، ويوجد بئر عميق ومغلق الان. ومن العناصر المعماريه المميزه فيه وجود قبّتان امويتان مسطحتان تقومان فوق مدخله الجنوبي، وعندهما يوجد اعمده حجريه ضخمه تشكل الاساس الذي تقوم عليه منطقه قبه الجامع القبلي، وقد رُممت عام 1927. بتمويل من الملك فاروق من مصر، وقد كان هذا المصلّى مغلقًا لا يُفتح الا في حالات الضروري حتى عام 1998، حيث تم تنظيفه واعداده ليكون مكانًا ملائمًا للصلاه، وهو يتّسع لحوالي 1000 مصلّ.\n4 - مسجد قبّه الصخره\n\nوتعتبر قبّته احدى اهم وابرز المعالم المعماريه الاسلامي، واقدم بناء اسلامي بقي محافظًا على شكله وزخرفته في الاغلب. بنى هذه القبّه الخليفه عبد الملك بن مروان، حيث بدا في بنائها عام 66 هـ الموافق 685م، وانتهى منها عام 72 هـ الموافق 691م، واشرف على بنائها المهندسان رجاء بن حيوه الكندي، وهو من التابعين المعروفين، ويزيد بن سلام مولى عبد الملك بن مروان. وقبّه الصخره عباره عن بناء مثمن الاضلاع له اربعه ابواب، وفي داخله تثمينه اخرى تقوم على دعامات واعمده اسطوانيه، في داخلها دائره تتوسطها «الصخره المشرفه» التي يعتقد المسلمون بان النبي محمد صعد منها الى السماء في رحله الاسراء والمعراج، وترتفع هذه الصخره نحو 1.5 مترًا عن ارضيه البناء، وهي غير منتظمه الشكل يتراوح قطرها بين 13 و18 مترًا، وتوجد مغاره تُسمّى «مغاره الارواح» اسفل جزء منها تعلوها فتحه، وتعلو الصخره في الوسط قبّه دائره بقطر حوالي 20 مترًا، مطليه من الخارج بالواح الذهب، ارتفاعها 35م، يعلوها هلال بارتفاع 5م. ويعتقد بعض الباحثين ان بناتها خططوا لجعلها قبه للمسجد الاقصى كاملاً.\n5 - مسجد البراق\n\nويقع في الناحيه الجنوبيه الغربيه من المسجد الاقصى، وسُمّي بذلك نسبهً الى المكان الذي ربط فيه النبي محمد دابته البراق في رحله الاسراء والمعراج، وفيه حلقه عثمانيه يُقال انّها وُضعت في مكان الحلقه التي رُبط عندها البراق. كما يحتوي المسجد على محراب اموي، وكان يوجد في جهته الغربيه باب قديم يُسمّى «باب البراق» وقد اُغلق بعد العهد الاموي، والذي كان يصل مباشره الى ساحه البراق خارج المسجد الاقصى، وينزل الى مصلّى البراق حاليًا من خلال الرواق الغربي للاقصى بدرجات حجريه، والذي يُفتح كل يوم جمعه للزياره.\n6 - مسجد المغاربه\nويقع في الزاويه الجنوبيه الغربيه من المسجد الاقصى جنوبي حائط البراق، وله بابان، واحد مُغلق في الجهه الشماليه، واخر مفتوح في الجهه الشرقيه. ويُستعمل اليوم كقاعه عرض لاغراض المتحف الاسلامي الذي نُقل من الرباط المنصوري الى هذا المسجد وذلك في عام 1348 هـ الموافق 1929. وقد قيل انّ اوّل من بناه هو صلاح الدين الايوبي سنه 590 هـ الموافق 1193، وكانت تُقام فيه الصلاه على المذهب المالكي.\n7 - جامع النساء\nويقع داخل المسجد الاقصى، ويمثّل الجزء الجنوبي الغربي منه، حيث يمتد بمحاذاه حائطه الجنوبي بدءًا من الجدار الغربي للجامع القِبلي وحتى الحائط الغربي للمسجد. وهو اليوم مُقسّم الى ثلاثه اقسام: اولها غربي ملحق بالمتحف الاسلامي، وثانيها في الوسط وبه توجد مكتبه الاقصى الرئيسيه، وثالثها شرقي ملاصق للجامع القبلي، ويُستعمل الان كمستودع. وجامع النساء عباره عن بناء كبير واسع مرتفع عن مستوى الجامع القبلي، ويرى باحثون بان بناءه يعود الى العهد الصليبي، حيث بُني ككنيسه، ليعيده صلاح الدين الايوبي لمُصلّى خُصّص للنساء.\n8-مصلى باب الرحمه\n\nانشا الاميون باب الرحمه ليكون مشتركا بين سور القدس التاريخي والمسجد الاقصى، وبُني المصلى ملاصقا له، فمنذ العهد الاموي حتى العباسي بقي المصلى مفتوحا، وتعمد الفرنجه خلال احتلالهم للمدينه فتح المصلى في ايام عيد الفصح، وبعد تحرير القدس اغلق القائد صلاح الدين الايوبي الباب المشترك بين السور والمسجد لاسباب امنيه واعاد استخدام المبنى للصلاه وظل كذلك في العهدين المملوكي والعثماني.اُهمل المكان في فتره الاحتلال البريطاني التي اتسمت بالتضييق على المصلين لكنه بقي مفتوحا امامهم طيله العهدين البريطاني والاردني، ومع مجيء الاحتلال الاسرائيلي عام 1967 تم تهميش المصلى، لكنه عاد وانتعش عام 1992 عندما بات مقرا للجنه التراث الاسلامي التي حُظرت عام 2003 وكان ذلك الاجراء الذريعه التي اتخذها الاحتلال لاغلاق المصلى المستهدف، وفي العام 2018 وضعت نقطه حراسه لشرطه الاحتلال الاسرائيلي اعلى المصلى، وفي العام 2019 وضعت قوات الاحتلال قفل على البوابه المؤديه للمصلى وهو ما فجّر هبّه شعبيه ادت لاعاده فتح المصلى، ومنذ اعاده فتح المصلى استهدفت شرطه الاحتلال الحراس والمصلين وكافه المبادرات الراميه لاعمار المصلى وتهيئته لاستقبال المصلين.\n\nواجهه المسجد والشرفه\nالواجهه\n\nتم بناء واجهه المسجد في عام 1065م، بناء على تعليمات من الخليفه الفاطمي المستنصر بالله. مع درابزين (بهو) يتكون من ممرات واعمده الصغيره. وقد تضررت الواجهه خلال الحقبه الصليبيه خلال حكمهم لفلسطين، ولكن تم ترميمها وتجديدها في العهد الايوبي. بالاضافه الى ذلك تم تغطيه الواجهه بالبلاط. اما المواد المستعمله في اقواس الواجهه فهي مواد زينه منحوته اخذت من الهياكل الصليبيه في القدس. كما يوجد اربعه عشر قوس حجري على طول الواجهه معظمها من نمط العماره الرومانسكيه، اما الاقواس الخارجيه التي اضيفت في العهد المملوكي فقد اتبعت نفس التصميم العام. كما يوجد قوس مركزي عند مدخل واجهه المسجد.\n\nالشرفه\nالشرفه تقع في الجزء العلوي من الواجهه. والخلجان المركزيه من الشرفه فهي تعود لفتره فرسان الهيكل اثناء الحمله الصليبيه الاولى، اما الشرفه نفسها فقد امر ببنائها المعظم ابن العادل ابو بكر بن ايوب اخ صلاح الدين الايوبي وذلك عام 1217م.\n\nالقباب\nيحتوي المسجد الاقصى عده قباب جميله تعد من ابرز معالمه واحدى التحف الاسلاميه الخالده، واجملها كما انها تضفي عليه جواً قدسياً، خاصه درتها قبه الصخره المشرفه الواقعه في قلب المسجد الاقصى المبارك. والمعلوم ان المسجد الاقصى يحتوي على خمسه عشره قبه وهي:\n\nقبه الصخره\n\nقبه الصخره هي المبنى المثمن ذو القبه الذهبيه، وموقعها بالنسبه للمسجد الاقصى ككل كموقع القلب من جسد الانسان اي انها تقع في وسطه الى اليسار قليلاً. وهذه القبه تعتبر هي قبه المسجد ككل، وهي من اقدم واعظم المعالم الاسلاميه المتميزه. ويعود تاريخ تاشييدها الى العهد الاموي عام 72هـ (692م)، وسميت بهذا الاسم نسبه الى الصخره التي تقع داخل المبنى والتي عرج منها النبي النبي محمد الى السماء في ليله الاسراء والمعراج على ارجح الاقوال لان الصخره هي اعلى بقعه في المسجد الاقصى. وقبه الصخره هي حالياً مصلى النساء في المسجد الاقصى. والصخره غير معلقه كما يعتقد عامه الناس، لكنه يوجد اسفلها مغاره صغيره.\n\nقبه السلسله.\n\nوتقع قبه السلسله داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك شرقي قبه الصخره، وتم تشييدها بناء على اوامر الخليفه الاموي عبد الملك بن مروان عام 72هـ (692م)، ويشير ابن عبد ربه مؤلف كتاب العقد الفريد، ان سبب تسميتها بقبه السلسله انه كانت توجد بها سلسله يمسها المتقاضون وان هذه السلسله حليف كل صديق في القول وانها تبتعد عن كل من يكذب وتربط هذه الروايات بين هذه السلسله وتلك التي كان يتخذها النبي داود لحسم النزاع بين الخصوم في مجلس القضاء، وهذا لاشك من الخزعبلات غير المقبوله.\nومن المعروف ان هذه القبه قد تعرضت للانتهاك اثناء الحملات الصليبيه واعيد تجديدها عده مرات منذ استرداد صلاح الدين الايوبي بيت المقدس وقد اوقفت سلطات الاحتلال الصهيوني عمليات الترميم التي كانت جاريه بها في عام 1970م ، ثم استكملت في التسعينات من القرن الماضي.\nوقبه السلسله هي على شكل سداسي يحملها مضلع مسدس مؤلف داخلياً من سته اعمده، تحمل تحمل بدورها العقود التي يرتكز عليها عامود القبه، وخارجها احد عشر عموداً تحمل عقوداً مماثله وقد سد فيما بعد بين اثنين من هذه الاعمده لانشاء المحراب الموجود بها وعلى ذلك فان لهذه القبه سبعه عشر عموداً، وقد كسيت هذه القبه ببلاطات من القاشاني التركي عند ترميمها في عهد السلطان سليمان القانوني في القرن 16م.\n\nقبه النحويه.\n\nتقع القبه النحويه في الطرف الجنوب الغربي لساحه قبه الصخره، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى العهد الايوبي عام 1207 على يد الامير حسام الدين ابي معد قمباز في عهد الملك شرف الدين ابو المنصور عيسى الايوبي، لتكون مدرسه متخصصه لتعليم العلوم اللغويه من صرف ونحو داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك، فعرفت بالقبه النحويه، وايضا المدرسه النحويه.\nتتكون القبه من ثلاث غرف متصله، حيث تقوم قبتها الكبرى فوق الغرفه الغربيه، بينما توجد قبه اخرى اقل ارتفاعا فوق الغرفه الشرقيه، ولها مدخل رّئيسي يقع في واجهتها الشّماليه.\nتحولت القبه النحويه الى مكتبه في عهد الاحتلال البريطاني، وتستعمل اليوم كمقر لمحكمه الاستئناف الشرعيه (وهو جزء من المحكمه الشرعيه في القدس، والذي يتبع بدوره للاردن)، واسمها الدقيق الان هو: مكتب القائم باعمال قاضي القضاه، ومن تحتها ارشيف المحكمه.\nوقد حماها هذا الاستعمال هو من اخطار الاحتلال، حيث انها تشرف بشكل واضح على حائط البراق من داخل الاقصى المبارك، كما تشرف على بابي المغاربه وباب السلسله. ولذلك تعتبر نقطهً ساخنهً عند وقوع اعتداءات صهيونيه على المسجد الاقصى المبارك، كما حدث في انتفاضه الاقصى عام 2000م، حيث اقتحم الصهاينه الاقصى من باب السلسله، وسيطروا على القبه النحويه، ومن ثم سيطروا على الجهه الجنوبيه الغربيه من المسجد الاقصى المبارك، وقتلوا شهيدا عند باب المغاربه، وقد استشهد 5 مصلين برصاص الاحتلال في ذلك اليوم، فضلا عن اصابه العشرات.\n\nقبه الارواح\nوتقع قبه الارواح داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك بالقرب من قبه المعراج، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى العهد العثماني في منتصف القرن 16م.\nوقد شيدت هذه القبه على مضلع مثمن الاضلاع يتالف من ثمانيه اعمده رخاميه تحمل ثمانيه عقود حجريه وهي قبه قليله الارتفاع بعض الشيء.\n\nقبه النبي سليمان\n\nوتقع قبه النبي سليمان داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك من الجهه الشماليه ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى العهد الاموي وعلى الارجح في عهد الخليفه سليمان بن عبد الملك.\nوتقوم هذه القبه ايضا على بناء مثمن يبدا باربعه من الرخام وتم تخصيص واحده منها لباب الدخول يواجه المحراب، وفوق المثمن تم تشييد عامود اسطواني وقد فتحت به ثمانيه نوافذ معقوده للاضاءه، وفوق هذا العامود خوذه القبه وهي حجريه متينه البنيان وبداخل هذه القبه توجد صخره صغيره.\n\nقبه الخضر\n\nوتقع قبه الخضر داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك في الزاويه الشماليه الغربيه لساحه قبه الصخره، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى الفتره العثمانيه، وتقوم هذه القبه على سته اعمده رخاميه رشيقه وتحمل هذه الاعمده عقودا حجريه مدببه ومزخرفه.\n\nقبه المعراج\n\nوتقع قبه المعراج داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك الى الشمال الغربي من قبه الصخره. وشيدت عام 1200م بامر من الامير عز الدين الزنجلي والي القدس في عهد السلطان العادل ابو بكر بن ايوب. وتم تشييدها لتخليد ذكرى المعراج، وتذكر بعض المصادر ان هذه القبه بنيت مكان قبه اخرى قديمه تعود الى عهد عبد الملك بن مروان، وقد اشار الى وجودها الرحاله ناصر بن خسرو قبل استيلاء الصليبيين على المدينه وهدمهم لها.\n\nويعتبر التصميم المعماري للقبه فريد من نوعه وهو مثمن الشكل مثل قبه الصخره المجاوره له، ونجد في كل ركن من اركان المثمن اربعه اعمده مدمجه الا الجهه الجنوبيه التي بها عمودان ليصبح مجموع الاعمده ثلاثين عمودا، وتحمل الاعمده ثمانيه عقود مدببه سدت فتحاتها بالرخام فيما عدا ضلع واحد يقع في الناحيه الجنوبيه، وقد شيد به محراب حجري تبرز حنيته من الخارج، ويقابله ضلع اخر في الناحيه الشماليه فتح به باب الدخول الى القبه، وقد شيدت خوذه القبه بعد تحويل اعلى المثمن الى دائره، وتتميز هذه القبه بوجود قبه اخرى صغيره فوقها، بما يشبه التاج فوق راسها.\nوالقبه تستخدم اليوم من قبل لجنه الاعمار في المسجد الاقصى المبارك.\n\nقبه الميزان\n\nتقع قبه الميزان في الركن الجنوبي من صحن الصخره المشرفه، ملاصقه للبائكه الجنوبيه، والمعلوم ان بوائك الاقصى تعرف ايضا بالموازيين، ومنه جاءت تسميه القبه باسم قبه الميزان. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى الفتره المملوكيه على يد قاضي القضاه برهان الدين بن جماعه الذي انشاها عام 1388م، قبه الميزان وتعرف ايضا بمنبر برهان الدين وذلك لانها على هيئه منبر فوقه قبه.\nوقد ذكر بعض المؤرخين ان المنبر في بدايه عهده كان عباره عن منبر خشبي جميل في شكله، وفي عام 1388م اعيد بناء المنبر بالكامل من الحجر على النمط الهندسي الذي تشتهر به المنابر المملوكيه المعروفه بنقشها وجمالها.\nويتكون هذا المنبر من بناء حجري، وله مدخل يقوم في اعلاه عقد يرتكز على عمودين صغيرين من الرخام. ويُصعد منه الى درجات قليله تؤدي الى دكه حجريه معده لجلوس الخطيب، وتقوم فوقها قبه لطيفه صغيره، وقد اقيمت على اعمده رخاميه جميله الشكل.\nوقدد جُدّد المنبر مرتين الاولى في عهد السلطان العثماني عبد المجيد بن محمود الثاني عام 1843م، والثانيه في اواخر سنه 2000م، على يد مجموعه من الطلبه الايطاليين، وذلك عن طريق دائره الاوقاف الاسلاميه.\n\nقبه يوسف اغا\nتقع القبه داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك على الجانب الغربي من الجامع القبلي، وتم تشييدها عام 1092هـ (1681م) بامر من يوسف اغا الوالي العثماني على القدس، وقد كانت على ما يبدو مخصصه للعباده على مقربه من الجامع القبلي. وهي تغطي هذه القبه مساحه مربعه شيدت بمداميك من الاحجار المشذبه وقد فتحت ثلاثه جدران بكاملها تقريباً على ساحه المسجد الاقصى المبارك، وذلك باستخدام عقود مدببه بينما شيد المحراب في الجدار الجنوبي، وهو محراب مجوف بسيط.\n\nقبه النبي موسى\n\nوتقع قبه النبي موسى داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك على بالقرب من البائكه الجنوبيه الغربيه، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى عام 1250م في عهد الملك الصالح نجم الدين ايوب بن الملك الكامل الايوبي، ويبدو من تصميمها انها كانت مخصصه لتعبد امراء الايوبيين عند زيارتهم للقدس او لبعض المشاهير والشيوخ بعد ذلك.\nوالقبه هي مربعه الجدران فتحت بها نوافذ للاضاءه ، ويقع المدخل في الضلع الشمالي المواجه لجدار القبه ومن ناحيه الشكل فقد تم تحويل المربع الى مثمن، وقد فتحت في اضلاع المثمن نوافذ للاضاءه ، وبعد ذلك تم تشييد خوذه القبه المثمنه.\n\nقبه النبي\nوتقع قبه النبي داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك غرب قبه الصخره، بجوار قبه المعراج ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى عام 1538 بامر من محمد بك والي غزه والقدس الشريف ثم اعاد تشييدها السلطان العثماني عبد المجيد الاول عام 1845، اما عن سبب تسميتها فيعتقد بعض المؤرخين انها بنيت في المكان الذي صلى فيه النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم اماما بالانبياء والملائكه في ليله الاسراء، حيث تشير بعض النصوص الى انّ المعراج كان على يمين الصخره، ويقول الباحثون ان هذا سبب تعدد القباب على يمين قبه الصخره.\nكما يعتبر محراب النبي هو اول ما تم تشييده في هذه القبه، وقد امر بتشييدها محمد بك والي غزه والقدس الشريف في عهد السلطان العثماني سليمان القانوني في عام 1538م، والمحراب هو على هيئه مستطيل رخامي لا يرتفع عن الارض كثيراً، وفي نهايته شكل ثلاثي الاضلاع اكثر ارتفاعاً من بقيه المستطيل.\nوفي عام 1845م، قام السلطان عبد المجيد الثاني بتشييد قبه فوق هذا المحراب ومنها جاءت تسميتها، وهي مثمنه الشكل قاعدتها من ثمانيه اعمده رخاميه رشيقه تحمل ثمانيه من العقود الحجريه المدببه.\n\nقبه يوسف\n\nتقع قبه يوسف داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك جنوب قبه الصخره، ويعود تشييدها الى العهد العثماني عام 1681 م. وسميت القبه بقبه يوسف تيمناً وتذكاراً بيوسف بن ايوب المعروف بالناصر صلاح الدين الايوبي. وتقوم هذه القبه على بناء مربع تتالف قاعدته من عمودين رخاميين رشيقين وجدار في ناحيه القِبله، ومن ثم فهي عباره عن ثلاثه عقود مفتوحه وجدار مسدود وبوسط هذا الجدار حنيه صغيره تشبه المحاريب المجوفه وبداخلها نص على لوح يحمل اسم صلاح الدين الايوبي، وهذا اللوح ماخوذ من برج بناه السلطان صلاح الدين على سور المدينه عند الخندق. وخلف هذا النص من الخارج يوجد نص اخر يبين اعمال البناء التي اجريت في العهد العثماني، واسم المشرف على البناء وهو علي اغا يوسف اغا.\n\nقبه عشاق النبي\nتقع قبه عشاق النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك، في الركن الجنوب الشرقي من باب العتم، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى عام 1817م في عهد السلطان العثماني محمود الثاني، ولهذا السبب تعرف باسم ايوان السلطان محمود الثاني. واما اسمها الحالي فمصدره اعتياد بعض شيوخ الصوفيه الاجتماع للذكر تحتها.\nوهي عباره عن مبنـى مربع الشكل طول ضلعه 7 امتار، قائم على اربع دعائم ركنيّه تعلوها اربعه عقود مدببه تعلوها قبـه ضحله. والمبنى مفتوح الجوانب، وبه محراب حجري مجوف جميل اضيف في فتره لاحقه في وسط الجهه الجنوبيّه. ويصعد الـى صحن هذه القبه من خلال ثلاث درجات من الجهتين الغربيه والشرقيّه، وارضيتها مبلّطه بالحجر، وعلى حافتها من الجهه الشماليه عمودان نائمان يبدو انّهما وضعا في زمن متاخّر كدربزين\n\nقبه الشيخ الخليلي.\n\nتقع قبه الشيخ الخليلي في صحن الصخره، في جزء الشمال الغربي من قبه الصخره، وتفصل بينهما قبتا النبي والمعراج. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى العهد العثماني عام 1700م، وعرفت باسم شيخ صوفي كان يؤمها ويتعبد فيها، وتعرف كذلك بقبه بخ بخ، ومصلى الخضر، ومسجد النبي.\nوالقبه هي عباره عن مبنى مربّع مقام على اربعه اركان، تعلوه قبّه ضحله على الطراز العثماني، وفي الجهات الاربع ثماني نوافذ مستطيله الشكل. حيث يقع في واجهه المبنى الشرقيّه باب صغير يعلوه نقش يحمل اسم وتاريخ المبنى. ويوجد بداخل هذه القبه من جهه القبله محراب من حجر كلسي ملكي فيه حنيه حجريّه، وتحت مبنى قبه الخليلي يوجد مبنى سفلي يسمى مغاره الارواح، يتوصل اليه من خلال سلم حجري مقطوع من الصخر، وهذا الكهف قليل التهويه عديم النور ولا يستعمل.\nوتستعمل القبه اليوم كمكتب للجنه اعمار المسجد الاقصى المبارك.\n\nقبه النبي عيسى/ مهد النبي عيسى\n\nوتقع قبه النبي عيسى والمسماه ايضا مهد النبي عيسى عند الزاويه الجنوبيه الشرقيه لسور القدس وسور المسجد الاقصى، وتم تشييده لتخليد ذكرى النبي عيسى، ورغم التجديدات التي لحقت به على مر العصور فهو يحتفظ بطابعه الاصلي والاساسي والذي ورد في اوصاف المؤرخين والرحاله الذين عاينوا هذا المكان المعروف باسم مهد النبي عيسى ومسجده. وجددت القبه في العهد العثماني على نفس طرازها القديم وهي محموله على اربعه عقود مدببه تستند بدورها على اربعه اعمده رخاميه رشيقه، وتحت هذه القبه يوجد حوض حجري يسمى مهد النبي عيسى، وامام هذا الحوض يوجد محراب حجري مجوف.\n\nالماَذن\nللمسجد اربع ماذن وهي:\n\nمئذنه باب المغاربه/ المئذنه الفخاريه\n\nتعتبر مئذنه المغاربه وتسمى ايضا المئذنه الفخاريه اول مئذنه تشيد في المسجد في عام 1278م، وتقع على الزاويه الجنوبيه الغربيه من المسجد الاقصى، وهي قريبه من باب المغاربه وتحديدا فوق الطرف الشمالي الغربي لجامع النساء الواقع داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك، بناء على اوامر من السلطان المملوكي لاجين. وسميت بالفخاريه نسبه الى فخر الدين الخليلي، والد القاضي شرف الدين عبد الرحمن الذي اشرف على بناء المبنى. وتم بناء المئذنه على الطراز السوري التقليدي، مع وجود قاعده مربعه الشكل وعامود، مقسوم الى ثلاثه طوابق ويقع فوق الطابقين الاولين شرفه المؤذن. ويحيط الشرفه غرفه مربعه التي تنتهي بدورها الى قبه حجريه مغطاه بالرصاص.\n\nمئذنه باب الغوانمه\nوتعتبر مئذنه الغوانمه المئذنه الثانيه التي تشيد في المسجد، وقد بناها المهندس المعماري القاضي شرف الدين الخليلي مابين 1297–98م،  وهي ايضا بناء على الاوامر من بناء على اوامر من السلطان المملوكي لاجين، وتقع في الركن الشمالي الغربي من الحرم القدسي الشريف بالقرب من باب الغوانمه . وتتكون من سته طوابق عاليه ونوازل، وهي اطول مئذنه في الحرم القدسي. وبرج المئذنه كلياً هو مصنوع من الحجر تقريبا، بصرف النظر عن القبه الخشبيه التي تقع على شرفه المؤذن، وبقيت مئذنه باب الغوانمه تقريبا بمناى عن الهزات الارضيه بسبب هيكلها الراسخ. والمئذنه تنقسم الى عده طوابق مشكله من الحجاره .ويعتبر الطابقين الاولين اوسع من بقيه الطوابق، ويشكلا قاعده البرج. ويعلو كلا من اربعه الطوابق الباقيه عمود اسطواني وقبه بصليه الشكل (منتفخه). اما الدرج فهو يقع خارج الطابقين الاول والثاني، ولكنه يصبح على شكل لولبي داخل الطابق الثالث حتى تصل الى شرفه المؤذن.\n\nمئذنه باب السلسله\n\nتعتبر مئذنه السلسله المئذنه الثالثه التي تشيد في المسجد وذلك في عام 1329 م بناء على اوامر الامير سيف الدين تنكز الناصري الحاكم المملوكي على الشام، في عهد السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون وذلك وفق ما جاء بالنقش التذكاري الموجود في الجهه الشرقيه من قاعده المئذنه:\n\nوتقع مئذنه باب السلسله على الحدود الغربيه من المسجد الاقصى شمال باب السلسله وتسمى ايضا بمناره المحكمه. وربما تكون هذه المئذنه حلت محل المئذنه الامويه في وقت سابق، ومبنى البرج هو مربع الشكل ومصنوع بالكامل من الحجاره. ومنذ القرن 16، فقد كان التقليد المتبع هو اختيار افضل مؤذن في المدينه وتم تعيينه في هذه المئذنه للنداء الى كل من الصلوات الخمس، ويتم رفع الاذان من هذه المئذنه اولا، لاعطاء الاشاره لمؤذني المساجد الاخرى في جميع انحاء القدس على ان تحذو حذوها.\n\nمئذنه باب الاسباط/ مئذنه الصلاحيه\n\nتعتبر مئذنه الاسباط المئذنه الرابعه للمسجد واخر مئذنه تشيده عليه وذلك في سنه 1367 كما انها تسمى ايضا بمئذنه الصلاحيه لكونها واقعه في جهه المدرسه الصلاحيه الواقعه خارج المسجد الاقصى المبارك،  وتقع هذه المئذنه في الجهه الشماليه للحرم القدسي الشريف، بين باب حطه وباب الاسباط، وقد بُنِيَت بامر من الامير سيف الدين قطلوبغا وهو ناظر الحرمين الشريفين في عهد السلطان المملوكي الاشرف شعبان، وذلك وفقاً للنقش التذكاري الذي كان موجوداً عليها:\n\nومئذنه الاسباط هي عباره برج حجر اسطواني (بني في وقت لاحق في العهد العثمانيين) وليست مربعه الماذن الاخرى، ويبدا برج المئذنه صعودا من قاعده مستطيله تعود للعهد المملوكي. ويضيق فوق شرفه المؤذن، وتنتشر فيه نوافذ دائريه، وتنتهي بقبه بصليه الشكل (منتفخه). وقد اعيد بناء القبه بعد وقوع زلزال وادي الاردن عام 1927.\nومن الجدير للذكر انه لا وجود للماذن في الجزء الشرقي من المسجد الاقصى المبارك. ومع ذلك، اعلن عبد الله الثاني ملك الاردن في عام 2006 عن نيته لبناء المئذنه الخامسه لتطل على جبل الزيتون. ومن المقرر ان تحمل المئذنه اسم حسين ملك الاردن كما انها سيكون اطول مبنى في البلده القديمه من القدس.\n\nابواب المسجد الاقصى\nيحتوي المسجد الاقصى على خمسه عشر باب منها ما هو مستعمل (مفتوح) في ايامنا هذه وعددها عشره، والبقيه مغلقه منذ زمن بعيد لاسباب عديده،: وتقع جميع الابواب المفتوحه في الجهه الشماليه والغربيه من المسجد، وهي في الوقت نفسه تقع ضمن اسوار المسجد الاقصى.\nابواب المسجد الاقصى تشترك جميعها في انها ابواب خشبيه مكونه من دفه او دفتين، وتشتمل على خوخه «فتحه» لتنظيم المرور استعملت لمرور المتاخرين بعد اغلاق الابواب عند الغروب.\nوقد برع المسلمون في الاعمال الخشبيه وتفننوا في زخرفتها واظهار تفصيلاتها والعنايه بدقائقها كالمزاليج والمفاتيح والمفاصل وغيرها من الامور التي تؤكد.\n\nالابواب المفتوحه\nباب الاسباط/ باب الاُسود\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه ويسمى ايضا باب الاًسود نسبه للاسدين المنحوتين على جانبي الباب ، ويقع في الزاويه الشماليه الشرقيه للمسجد الاقصى، ويعود تاريخ تجديد بنائه الى الفتره الايوبيه، كما تم تجديد الباب في الفتره المملوكيه في 1367م.\nوالواجهه الجنوبيه لهذا الباب هي مدخل بارتفاع 4 امتار تقريباً وفتحه مستطيله بعقد مدبب، وفي زاويه المدخل توجد دركاه مربعه الشكل تعد جزءاً من الرواق الشمالي، وللباب دفتان من الخشب يبدو انهما حديثتا العهد، ويوجد في احد الدفتين خوخه (مدخل صغير) تسمح بدخول شخص واحد فقط، ويعد مدخل الدركاه احد اقواس الرواق الشمالي الضخمه المدببه. اما الواجهه الشماليه للباب فهي فتحه مستطيله لقوس مدبب عرضه 2 متر تقريباً وارتفاعه 4 امتار كما ان المدخل مسقوف بقنطره مدببه عرضها حوالي 1 متر.\n\nباب حطه\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه، ويقع في الواجهه الشماليه للمسجد الاقصى وتحديدا ضمن الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الشمالي. وقد تم تجديده عام 1220م في الفتره الايوبيه في عهد شرف الدين ابو المنصور عيسى الايوبي. وتتكون واجهته الجنوبيه التي تقع داخل المسجد من باب مستطيل ذي عقد حجري موتور، وعليه باب خشبي من دفتين، في احداها خوخه صغيره، ويتقدمه دركاه وهي جزء من الرواق الشمالي ايضا مدخلها عباره عن عقد حجري مدبب يعلوه صف من الكوابل الحجريه عددها تسعه كوابل، يزداد قطرها كلما ارتفعنا لاعلى الباب، وبين فتحه الباب وهذه الكوابل يوجد ثلاثه زخارف دائريه بارزه على مركز الفتحه واطرافها.\n\nباب العتم\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه ويسمى ايضا باب فيصل نسبه الى الملك فيصل الاول. وقد جدد بناء هذا الباب في الفتره الايوبيه، في ايام الملك المعظم ابن الملك العادل ابو بكر بن ايوب سنه 1213، وذلك عند تجديد الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى. كما انه يعرف ولهذا الباب عده اسماء فهو باب الدودداريه، وباب الملك فيصل، وباب شرف الانبياء.\nوتتكون واجهه الباب الجنوبيه من فتحه ارتفاعها 4 امتار، وعليها باب خشبي من دفتين يتقدمه من الجهه الجنوبيه دركاه تعد جزءاً من الرواق الشمالي، وهي مغطاه بعقد صليبي ومدخل الدركاه عباره عن قوس مدبب ضخم، وهو يقع ضمن سلسله اقواس الرواق الشمالي\n\nباب الغوانمه/باب الوليد\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه، ويعتبر اول باب يشيد في الجدار الغربي ابتداء من الناحيه الشماليه، وقد انشئ في العهد الاموي، وعرف انذاك باسم باب الوليد نسبه الى الوليد بن عبد الملك، وقد جدد الباب عام 1307م وذلك عند انشاء الرواق الغربي للمسجد في عهد قلاوون، والباب مستطيل الشكل نسبه عرضه الى ارتفاعه لباقي ابواب المسجد تعد قليله، وعلى المدخل باب خشبي من دفه واحده من الخشب يوجد به خوخه صغيره لتمييزها من الباب ويتقدم الباب من الجهه الشرقيه دهليز معقود بعقد برميلي واجهته عقد حجري مدبب، يرقى للباب بواسطه ثماني درجات عن ساحه المسجد الاقصى المبلطه، وبجانب الباب عقد مدبب اخر لكنه مغلق.\n\nباب الناظر\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه، يقع في الجدار الغربي لساحه المسجد الاقصى، وقد جدد بناؤه في الفتره الايوبيه سنه 1203م في عهد الملك المعظم عيسى بن احمد، وله عده اسماء اخرى متداوله مثل باب الحبس لقربه من الحبس ايام العثمانيين، وباب المجلس .\nويتقدم الباب من الجهه الشرقيه دركاه مربعه تقع ضمن امتداد الرواق الغربي، وتغطيها قبه مرفوعه على ثلاثه صفوف من المقرنصات، اما فتحه الباب فهي عباره عن مستطيل ضخم ارتفاعه 4,5 متر وعرضه 2 متر، ويعلو الفتحه المستطيله قوس موتور تعلوه زخرفه على شكل رواق صغير، وتنفصل مساحه الدركاه عن بقيه الرواق باقواس مدببه. وعلى الدعامه التي تقع على عقد المدخل المدبب والعقد المجاور له من عقود الرواق يوجد نقش حجري، ويبين النقش تاريخ البناء والسلطان الذي جدد في عهده. ويتقدم الباب قنطره مغطاه بقبو متقاطع يؤدي الى طريق باب الناظر المؤديه الى طريق الواد. وفي الجهه الجنوبيه من القنطره مدخل يؤدي بواسطه درج حجري، وفي الجهه الشماليه مدخل المدرسه المنجكيه.\n\nباب الحديد\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه، ويقع في الواجهه الغربيه للمسجد الاقصى، وهو احد المداخل المتفرعه عن طريق باب العمود. وقد سمي بهذا الاسم نسبه الى الامير ارغون الذي يعني باللغه التركيه الـحديد، وقد جدد في عهده بين سنتي 755هـــ و758هـــ/1354-1357م، والباب عباره عن فتحه مستطيله بعقد، ويتقدمه من الواجهه الشرقيه دركاه مغطاه بقبو متقاطع، وباب الحديد على شكل قوس حذوي مدبب على جانبيه مداميك حجريه بارتفاع 60 سم تقريبا، ويعلو الباب واجهه تعود للفتره المملوكيه، وتتوسط هذه الواجهه نافذه معقوده بعقد مدبب زخرف بخطوط متعرجه.\n\nباب القطانين\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه، ويقع في الجهه الغربيه لساحه المسجد الاقصى، ويعد من الابواب الرئيسيه الهامه والجميله المؤديه للمسجد، ويؤدي هذا الباب الى سوق القطانين ومنه جاءت تسميته، وقد جدد هذا الباب في عهد السلطان قلاوون على يد الامير سيف الدين تنكز عام 1336م، وهذا واضح من خلال نقش يوجد في اعلى المدخل من الجهه الشرقيه المطله على ساحه الحرم القدسي، وقد ازيلت على يد المجلس الاسلامي الاعلى سنه 1922م. والواجهه الشماليه للباب مكونه من قوصره مدخل تنخفض عن مستوى الساحه بتسع درجات تحيط بها من ثلاث جهات، وهذه القوصره واسعه حيث يبلغ عرضها 7 امتار تقريباً وارتفاعها 13 متر، وهي مغطاه بنصف قبه من الحجر. واما المفتاح فهو اسود اللون ونصف القبه مقامه على خمسه صفوف من المقرنصات، وفتحه الباب مستطيله بارتفاع 4 امتار وعرض 2,5 متر ويعلو الباب عتب حجري مستقيم وهو مكون من ثلاث قطع خارجيه.\n\nباب المطهره\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه، ويقع في الواجهه الغربيه لساحه المسجد الاقصى، ويؤدي الى المتوضا (مكان الوضوء)، ولذلك سمي بباب المطهره، وقد جدد في العهد المملوكي سنه 1266م، على يد الامير ادغيدي، وهناك من يرى انه جدد سنه 1267م على يد الامير علاء الدين البصيري، وتتكون الواجهه الغربيه للباب من عقد حجري مدبب، وهو يخلو من اي عنصر معماري مزخرف، وعليه باب خشبي من دفتين في احداها خوخه صغيره والباب بارتفاع 3,5 متر تقريبا، وعرضه 2 متر، اما الجهه الشرقيه من الباب فهو فتحه مستطيله في عقد حجري موتور عليه مدماكان من الحجر، ويتقدمه دركاه مغطاه بقبو متقاطع، وهي جزء من الرواق الغربي.\n\nباب السلسله والسكينه/باب النبي داود\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه ويسمى ايضا باب النبي داود، ويقع في الواجهه الغربيه من ساحه المسجد الاقصى ضمن الرواق الغربي، ويعد من الابواب الرئيسيه المؤديه الى المسجد الاقصى، وهناك من يعتبرهما بابين منفصلين وليس باباً واحداً بمدخلين. اما الباب الاول والمسمى بباب السلسله، فهو مفتوح ويؤمه الزائرون للمسجد الاقصى، وقد سمي بهذا الاسم للاعتقاد بوجود سلسله كانت معلقه فيه او ربما لوجود علاقه ما تربطه بقبه السلسله، اما الاخر فهو باب السكينه، وهو يقع شمال باب السلسله، وهو ملاصق له، والباب لا يفتح الا في حالات الطوارئ والضروره القصوى، وقد جدد هذان البابان في الفتره الايوبيه سنه 1203م، في عهد السلطان الملك العادل سيف الدين ابو بكر، وهناك من يرى انه في عهد الملك المعظم عيسى، ويتكون المدخل من بابين متسعين بارتفاع 4,5 متر وعرض 2 متر والفتحه مستطيله بقوس موتور عليه باب خشبي من دفتين، في احداهما خوخه صغيره لتنظيم المرور الى المسجد الاقصى.\n\nباب المغاربه\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه، ويقع في الزاويه الغربيه الجنوبيه لساحه المسجد الاقصى، وسمي بباب المغاربه لانه يوصل الى حاره المغاربه غرب الاقصى، ويعرف ايضا بباب البراق، وباب النبي، حيث يعتقد ان الرسول محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم دخل منه الى المسجد الاقصى المبارك ليله الاسراء والمعراج، كما يعتقد بعض المؤرخين ان عمر بن الخطاب دخل منه الى الاقصى ايضا بعد الفتح، حيث اورد ابن كثير: \n\nوقد اعيد بناؤه في الفتره المملوكيه في عهد السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون الذي قام بانشاء الاروقه الغربيه ما بين سنه 1305م- 1336م،  والباب من الواجهه الغربيه معقود بعقد مدبب بسيط التكوين. اما الجهه الشرقيه فهو عباره عن فتحه مستطيله ، وهو على شكل قوس موتور عليه باب خشبي بدفه واحده، ويفضي من الجهه الشرقيه الى دركاه تقع ضمن امتداد الرواق، وهي مؤلفه من عقدين حجريين، وتقوم على ثلاث دعامات، وعلى مركز الدعامه الوسطى زخرفه حجريه بشكل مربع في وسطه دائره، ويغطيها قبوان متقاطعان، ويجاور الباب من الجهه الشماليه مسجد صغير يسمى مسجد البراق.\n\nالابواب المغلقه\nالباب المنفرد\nهو احد المداخل الجنوبيه المغلقه في الجزء الجنوبي الشرقي من سور مدينه القدس والمسجد الاقصى المبارك، وقد اغلق بطريقه متقنه للغايه حتى لا يظهر للباب اي اثر من داخل اسوار المسجد، وقد سمي بباب الوحيد المفرد والمغلق الذي يظهر للعيان، وقد اشتهر عند المؤرخين العرب باسم باب العين لانه يؤدي الى عين سلوان.\n\nالباب الثلاثي\n\nوهو احدى ابواب المسجد المغلقه، وهو عباره عن ثلاث بوابات متجاوره تقع في الجدار الجنوبي من سور المسجد الاقصى على بعد 50 متراً من البوابه المفرده، و80 متراً من البوابه المزدوجه. وهذه البوابات شامخه العلو بجوار بعضها البعض، اتساع كلٍ منها 13 قدماً، وقد اشتهرت عند المؤرخين والكتّاب العرب باسم بوابات محراب مريم او باب محراب مريم، وهذا الباب قديم العهد يعود الى عصر ادريانوس باني القدس سنه 135م، وهو مغلق منذ اوائل القرن التاسع عشر ميلادي.\n\nالباب المزدوج\nوهو احدى ابواب المسجد المغلقه، وهو باب بمدخلين مزدوجين مغلقين، يقع في الجهه الجنوبيه من سور الجامع الاقصى خلف منبر الامام تماماً حيث يؤدي الى اسفل الجامع الاقصى عبر ممداخل مائله، ويبعد عن الباب الثلاثي مسافه 80 متراً. وهو باب قديم جداً يعود تاريخه الى البيزنطيين، ومن اسماء هذا الباب: بوابه خلده، بوابه الاقصى القديمه، وبوابه النبي.\n\nالباب الذهبي (باب الرحمه والتوبه)\n\nوهو احدى ابواب المسجد المغلقه، ويكاد ان يكون الباب الوحيد في الجهه الشرقيه الشماليه للسور لولا وجود باب صغير يسمى باب الجنائز، وهناك من يرى ان الباب الذهبي اسس قبل الفتح الاسلامي للمدينه، الا انه لم يبق من ذلك البناء سوى الموقع، وربما لمسات من التصميم العام، وقد اعيد بناؤه مرات عديده بعد ذلك، منها ما كان بعد جلاء الفرس عن القدس ودخول الامبراطور هرقل، واما البناء الاخير فقد تم في العصر الاموي، والباب الذهبي في حقيقه الامر مكون من بابين الرحمه والتوبه، اما اغلاقهما فيرجح انهما اغلقا في عهد صلاح الدين الايوبي بعد اخراجه الصليبيين من القدس، وذلك لاسباب امنيه، وهناك من يقول انهما اغلقا بامر الخليفه عمر بن الخطاب للاسباب نفسها، ومهما يكن فان الحصيله هي ان هذه الابواب مغلقه منذ زمن ولم تفتح الى يومنا هذا. اما اسم الباب الذهبي فقد اطلقه عليه المسيحيون لاعتقادهم ان السيد المسيح سيمر من خلاله عند رجوعه، وهم يؤمنون بانه كان قد دخل منه فعلاً في احد الشعانين.\n\nباب الجنائز\nوهو احدى ابواب المسجد المغلقه، يقع في السور الشرقي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك يؤدي الى المقبره المجاوره بعد الصلاه عليها في المسجد الاقصى، وهو باب صغير لا يستخدم حاليا. تظهر اثاره من خلف الخزائن الحديديه التي يستعملها حراس باب الاسباط في المكان، لكن المرجح انه كان يقع جنوبي باب الرحمه. وعلى اي حال، فيحتمل ان يكون قد وجد في التاريخ بابان بهذا الاسم، حيث يمكن ان يكون الباب قديماً كان جنوب باب الرحمه، ومن ثم تحول في فترات متاخره (على الاصح الفتره العثمانيه) الى قرب باب الاسباط.\nكان هذا الباب يستخدم لاخراج الجنائز من المسجد الاقصى المبارك الى مقبره الرحمه المحاذيه للسور الشرقي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك، واغلق على الارجح بامر من السلطان صلاح الدين الايوبي بعد تحرير القدس في 583هـ - 1187م، لحمايه المسجد والمدينه من اي غزو محتمل.\n\nالمساطب\nالاروقه\nيحتوي المسجد الاقصى على رواقان يمتدان من جهته الشماليه والغربيه وهما\n\nالرواق الغربي\nوهو ممر مسقوف يتكون من 55 عقدا، ويمتد بطول الواجهه الغربيه للمسجد الاقصى، بنى على عده مراحل في العهد المملوكي، وتحديدا ما بين عامي 1307 و1336م بهدف تسهيل المرور بين كافه المعالم الموجوده في المنطقه الغربيه للمسجد المبارك.\n\nالرواق الشمالي\nهو ممر مسقوف بطول الواجهه الشماليه للمسجد الاقصى، وقد بني على عده مراحل في العهدين الايوبي والمملوكي، وتحديدا ما بين عامي 1213 و1367م، بهدف تسهيل المرور بين كافه المعالم الموجوده في المنطقه الشماليه للمسجد.\nواليوم يتكون الرواق من عده مدارس، ولم يتبق اي جزء منه.\n\nالمدارس\nتتميز بيوت العباده في الاسلام بكونها دور عباده وعلم في انٍ واحد، حيث نجد ان الكثير من المساجد تعتبر جامعا وجامعه في ان واحد. ولذا حرص المسلمون منذ العصور الاسلاميه المبكره على اقامه المدارس في المسجد الاقصى المبارك، ووقفها على الشيوخ والطلاب الذين يرابطون في هذا الموضع الشريف طلبا للعلم والثواب. وتنتشر مدارس المسجد الاقصى المبارك في الرواقين الشمالي والغربي للمسجد، وبعضها يمتد خارج سور المسجد المبارك ملاصقا له، وكلها تعتبر جزءا لا يتجزا من الاقصى الشريف، ونذكر منها \n\nمدارس ورياض الاقصى الاسلاميه\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع هذه المدارس داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك، بين بابي حطه وفيصل. انشئت في مطلع الثمانينات من القرن العشرين. ولها فروع عديده بعضها خارج المسجد الاقصى المبارك.\n\nالمدرسه البكريه/الدواداريه\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع على الحد الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك من الخارج الى الشمال من مدارس ورياض الاقصى الاسلاميه، وهي مدرسه كبيره من مدارس البلده القديمه، وتمتد غربا حتى المدرسه العمريه، وكانت تعرف حتى اواسط القرن العشرين باسم «المدرسه الدواداريه»، نسبه لبانيها الامير علم الدين سنجر الدوادار، سنه 695هـ -1295م.\nوقد ظلت المدرسه البكريه تستعمل كمدرسه اكاديميه ابتدائيه حتى مجيء الاحتلال الصهيوني حيث حول الجزء الاكبر منها الى مدرسه للمعاقين تخضع لاداره دائره المعارف التابعه لبلديه القدس المحتله منذ عام 1967م.\nثانويه الاقصى الشرعيه\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك، غلب عليها هذا الاسم لانها كانت عند انشائها في مطلع الثمانينيات من القرن العشرين ثانويه محضه، واليوم هي عباره عن مدرسه اعداديه وثانويه لطلبه الفرع الشرعي من الذكور.\n\nالمدرسه الغادريه\n\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك. يعود تاريخ تشييدها الى عهد السلطان المملوكي برسباي عام 1432م على يد مصر خاتون زوجه الامير ناصر الدين بن دلغادر، ومنه جاءت تسميتها.\nتم تجديدها من قبل دائره الاوقاف الاسلاميه، لكن سلطات الاحتلال منعت تتمه السقف، ولا زالت بلا سقف حتى اليوم.\nوالحقيقه ان هذا هو حال معظم مدارس الاقصى اليوم، التي اهملت بسبب مزاعم الصهاينه انها تحوي اثارا يهوديه، مما ادى الى اهمال الكثير من المدارس القديمه واغلاقها، او تاجيرها للسكنى.\n\nالمدرسه الباسطيه\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع فوق مدارس ورياض الاقصى الاسلاميه الواقعه داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك بين بابي حطه والعتم. ويعتبر شمس الدين محمد الهروي شيخ الصلاحيه وناظر الحرمين في العهد المملوكي اول من بدا بتشييدها، ولكن ادركته المنيه قبل عمارتها، فعمرها القاضي زين الدين عبد الباسط بن خليل الدمشقي، سنه 835هـ -1431م، وحملت المدرسه اسمه.\nوقد كانت المدرسه الباسطيه مدرسه عظيمه اشتهرت في ارجاء العالم الاسلامي، حيث تخرج منها العديد من العلماء ودرس فيها العديد من الحفاظ ورواه الحديث والاطباء وعلماء الفلك والرياضيات. وهي اليوم عباره عن قسمين: واحد ماهول بجماعه من ال جار الله، والاخر يستعمل مقرا للمدرسه البكريه.\n\nالمدرسه الامينيه\n\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع غربي باب العتم في السور الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى، ويحدها من الشرق الطريق الداخل الى باب العتم، ومن الشمال طريق المجاهدين، ومن الغرب المدرسه الفارسيه، ومن الجنوب ساحه المسجد الاقصى المبارك. وهي مؤلفه من اربعه طوابق. وتسمى ايضا دار الامام، حيث درّس فيها اجداد عائله الامام واتخذت دارا لسكناهم.\nويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى عام 730هـ -1329م في العهد المملوكي على يد الوزير امين الدين عبد الله بن غانم، الذي كان احد المسؤولين في جيش الناصر محمد بن قلاوون ويعرف بامين الملك، فعرفت باسمه، وقد جرى ترميمها في العهد العثماني.\nوتعتبر هذه المدرسه من اجمل المدارس المطله على ساحات المسجد الاقصى، ومن اهمها\n\nالمدرسه الملكيه\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع في الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك بين المدرسه الفارسيه شرقا، والمدرسه الاسعرديه غربا، ومدخلها مشترك مع الاسعرديه. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى عام 741هـ - 1340م، في عهد السلطان المملوكي الناصر محمد بن قلاوون، واوقفها الحاج ال الملك الجوكندار، بعد بنائها باربع سنوات. والمدرسه

والسبيل عين ماء وما لحقها، وقد زودت بصنابير للمياه وثلاجات لدى تجديدها في العصر الحديث.\nويعود انشاء هذه الاسبله الى العصرين الايوبي والمملوكي، كما ان كثيرا منها استحدث او جدد في العصر العثماني بامر السلطان سليمان القانوني الذي تميز عهده ببناء الاسبله. وللاقصى اسبله كثيره نذكر منها 14 التاليه:\n\nسبيل الكاس\n\nيقع هذا السبيل المشهور امام المصلى القبلي، قيل انه من بناء العباسيين في الاصل، ولكن البناء الحالي تم في عهد السلطان الايوبي العادل ابو بكر بن ايوب عام 589هـ/1193م، وقد جدده المماليك وقاموا بتوسعته في عهد الامير سيف الدين تنكز عام 1327-1328م، لاستيعاب المزيد من المصلين. على الرغم من

تشييده الى العهد العثماني.\n\nسبيل باب حطه\nيوجد هذا السبيل البسيط على شكل تجويف داخل الجدار الشرقي لباب حطه، ويعود تاريخ تشييده الى العهد العثماني، وقد رممته مؤسسه الاقصى لاعمار المقدسات الاسلاميه اثناء بنائها لوحده المراحيض القريبه مؤخرا، ثم اُلْغٍي نهائيا بعد ذلك.\nوالى الشرق من باب حطه.\n\nبركه النارنج\n\nوهي بركه تقع في الساحات الغربيه للمسجد الاقصى المبارك امام المدرسه الاشرفيه، بين مصطبه سبيل قايتباي شمالا، وسبيل قاسم باشا جنوبا، وتسمى ايضاً بركه عنغج، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى 887هـ/1482م في عهد السلطان المملوكي قايتباي، وقامت لجنه اعمار المقدسات بترميمها مؤخرا.\nوهي بركه مربعه الشكل، طول ضلعها سبعه امتار، فرشت ارضها وحيطانها بالرخام، يتوسطها صحن به نافوره معطله، ويحيط بها اربع وعشرين حنفيه من ثلاث جهات.\n\nسبيل الشيخ بدير\n\nيقع سبيل الشيخ بدير الى الجنوب الشرقي من باب الحبس، غرب البائكه الشماليه الغربيه التي تقود الى صحن قبه الصخره، وقد بني في عهد السلطان العثماني محمود الاول عام 1153هـ/1740م، باشراف مصطفى اغا قائم مقام القدس، وبامر من الوالي عثمان بيك. وتسمى ايضا سبيل البديري.\nوقد نُقِشَتْ عليه عده ابيات شعريه مقروءه وجميله، في رخامه على حائطه الشرقي. وهو اليوم معطل رغم انه رُمٌِمَ حديثا على يد دائره الاوقاف الاسلاميه.\n\nسبيل منبر برهان الدين\nيقع هذا السبيل على زاويه درج البائكه الجنوبيه، خلف قبه الميزان (وتسمى ايضا منبر برهان الدين)، في الساحات الجنوبيه للمسجد الاقصى. ويعود تاريخ تشييده الى عام 1418هـ/1998م على يد لجنه الاعمار المنبثقه عن دائره الاوقاف الاسلاميه.\nويبلغ تعداد صنابيرها اربعه وعشرين، ويستخدمها بعض الزائرين للوضوء.\n\nسبيل الزيتونه\nويقع السبيل غربي سبيل الكاس، اقامته لجنه التراث الاسلامي حديثا برعايه دائره الاوقاف الاسلاميه. وقد سُمِّيَ بهذا الاسم نسبه الى شجره الزيتون التي تحيط بها حنفياته السبع.\nيعمل السبيل من خلال ثلاجه في عرق الزيتونه المعمره ذات الثلاث شعب، والتي عرفت منذ بدايات القرن العشرين باسم زيتونه النبي، ولا يعرف سبب تسميتها بهذا الاسم.\n\nسبيل الرحمه\nيقع السبيل غرب بابي الرحمه والتوبه، ويعود تاريخ تشييده الى 1416هـ/1995م على يد لجنه التراث الاسلامي، وهو عباره عن اثنتي عشره حنفيه عامره ومستعمله.\n\nمعالم

ارتفاعه فيقل عن 20 مترا، وقد عرف بهذا الاسم لان النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم ربط دابته البراق فيه على الارجح يوم اسرائه الى المسجد الاقصى المبارك.\n\nمنبر نور الدين الزنكي\nهو منبر تاريخي شهير يمثل روعه الفن والزخرفه الاسلاميه، بناه نور الدين زنكي عام 564هـ/1168م، ليحمل الى المسجد الاقصى بعد تحريرها من الصليبيين، لكنه مات قبل ان يحقق ذلك، فلما حرر صلاح الدين بيت المقدس، امر باحضاره من حلب، وذلك بعد اكثر من عشرين عاما من بنائه، ووضعه داخل المصلى القبلي وهو المصلى الرئيسي في المسجد الاقصى المبارك.\nوالمنبر مصنوع من الخشب المطعّم بالعاج والابنوس، تعب النجّارون والصنّاع والمهندسون فيه سنين، وكان لترديد النظر فيه على الايّام الوفاً، له بوّابه يرتفع فوقها تاجٌ عظيم ثمّ درج يرقى الى قوس اعلاه وشرف خشبيّه.\n\nوفي عام 1389هـ/1969م، احرق المصلى القبلي في حريق الاقصى مما ادى ايضا الى تدمير المنبر بالكامل، ولدى اعاده ترميم الجامع بين عامي 1389هـ/1969م و1402هـ/1982م وقد استحدث منبر حديدي بسيط الصناعه مكان منبر نور الدين، وهو منبر مؤقت بقي هناك حتى تم انشاء منبر اخر مطابق للمنبر الاصلي وبنفس المميزات والمواد في الاردن، وتم تركيبه في بدايه شهر فبراير عام 2007م.\n\nابار الاقصى\nيحتوي الاقصى على 25 بئرا عامره، فيها من الماء ما يكفى سكانَ البلده القديمه بالقدس، وليس للمصلين الذين يفدون الى الاقصى فقط. وهذه الابار موزعه بين صحن الصخره المشرفه في قلب المسجد الاقصى المبارك، وباقي ساحات المسجد الاقصى المبارك، حيث يوجد منها ثمانيه فوق صحن الصخره، وسبعه عشر في الساحات المحيطه ومن اشهرها:\n\nبئر الجنه\nبئر رمانه\n\nمصاطب المسجد الاقصى المبارك\nتنتشر في ساحات المسجد الاقصى المبارك 26 مصطبه، خاصه الساحات الغربيه، واغلبها يعود للفتره العثمانيه، وهي عباره عن مساحات مسطحه ترتفع ببناء لمسافه اقل من متر عن سطح الارض. وتبنى عاده من الحجر، ويتم الوصول اليها من خلال عده درجات. وغالبا ما يكون لها محراب على شكل حنيه او تجويف في جدار صغير يحدد اتجاه القبله. وتستخدم المصاطب للجلوس والصلاه والتدريس، خاصه في فصل الصيف. اغلبها غير مؤرخ\n\nمصاطب غير مؤرخه :\n\nقدسيه المسجد الاقصى عند المسلمين\nكان الاقصى قبله المسلمين الاولى وقبله يهود يثرب، لكن الله امر النبي بتحويل القبله الى المسجد الحرام: ﴿قَدْ نَرَى تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي السَّمَاءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَهً تَرْضَاهَا فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ وَاِنَّ الَّذِينَ اُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ اَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ ۝١٤٤ وَلَئِنْ اَتَيْتَ الَّذِينَ اُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ بِكُلِّ ايَهٍ مَا تَبِعُوا قِبْلَتَكَ وَمَا اَنْتَ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَتَهُمْ وَمَا بَعْضُهُمْ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَهَ بَعْضٍ وَلَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتَ اَهْوَاءَهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ اِنَّكَ اِذًا لَمِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ ۝١٤٥﴾\n\nفضائل المسجد الاقصى\nورد لدى المسلمين في القران، وفي احاديث النبي محمد العديد من فضائل المسجد الاقصى واهميته، منها:\n\nفي القران: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي اَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ اِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْاَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ايَاتِنَا اِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾ (1)\nعن ميمونه بنت الحارث انها قالت: «يا رسول الله افتِنَا في بيت المقدس، فقال: اِيتوهُ فصلُّوا فيه، وكانت البلاد اذ ذاك حربًا، فان لم تاتوه وتصلّوا فيه فابعثوا بزيتٍ يُسرَج في قناديله».\nعن ام سلمه عن النبي محمد انه قال: «من اهلَّ بعمرهٍ من بيتِ المقدسِ غُفر له».\nعن ابي سعيد الخدري، عن النبي محمد انه قال: «لا تُشَدُّ الرحالُ الا الى ثلاثهِ مساجدَ: المسجدِ الحرام، والمسجدِ الاقصَى، ومسجدي هذا».\nعن جابر بن عبد الله، عن النبي محمد انه قال: «صلاهٌ في المسجدِ الحرامِ مائهُ الفِ صلاهٍ، وصلاهٌ في مسجدِي الفُ صلاهٍ، وفي بيتِ المقدسِ خمسمائهِ صلاهٍ».\nعن ابي ذر الغفاري، عن النبي محمد انه قال: «صلاهً في مسجدي هذا (المسجد النبوي) افضلُ من اَرْبَعِ صلواتٍ فيهِ (المسجد الاقصى)، ولَنِعمَ المُصَلى هُوَ، ولِيُوشِكَنَّ اَنْ لا يَكُونَ للرَّجلِ مثلُ شطنِ فرسهِ من الارضِ حيث يَرَى مِنهُ بيتَ المقدسِ خيراً لَهُ مِنَ الدنيا جميعاً».\n\nللمسجد الاقصى قدسيه كبيره عند المسلمين ارتبطت بعقيدتهم منذ بدايه الدعوه. فهو يعتبر قبله الانبياء جميعاً قبل النبي محمد وهو القبله الاولى التي صلى اليها النبي قبل ان يتم تغير القبله الى مكه.\nوقد توثقت علاقه الاسلام بالمسجد الاقصى ليله الاسراء والمعراج، حيث انه اسرى بالنبي من المسجد الحرام الى المسجد الاقصى، وفيه صلى النبي اماماً بالانبياء ومنه عرج النبي الى السماء. وفي السماء العليا فرضت عليه الصلاه.\nذكر القران واصفاً ليله الاسراء والمعراج: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي اَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ اِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْاَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ايَاتِنَا اِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾، ووصف الله للمسجد الاقصى بـ﴿الذي باركنا حوله﴾، يدل على بركه المسجد ومكانته عند الله وعند المسلمين. فالاقصى هو منبع البركه التي عمت كل المنطقه حوله في اعتقاد المسلمين.\nوروي عن ام المؤمنين ام سلمه انها سمعت رسول الله يقول:\n\nوللصلاه في المسجد الاقصى ثواب يعادل خمسمائه صلاه في غيره من المساجد. قال رسول الله: « الصلاه في المسجد الحرام بمائه الف صلاه، والصلاه في مسجدي بالف صلاه، والصلاه في بيت المقدس بخمسمائه صلاه »، وفي روايه اخرى ان الصلاه في المسجد الاقصى تعدل مئتين وخمسين صلاه في غير المساجد الثلاثه.\nوهو المسجد الذي امر النبي الصحابه بالبقاء قربه، فقد روى احمد في مسنده عن ذِي الاصَابِعِ قَال: «قلت: يا رسول الله، اِنِ ابْتُلِينَا بعدك بالبقاء اين تامرنا؟ قال: عليك ببيت المقدس فلعله ان ينشا لك ذريه يعدون الى ذلك المسجد ويروحون».\nويعتبر المسجد الاقصى ثالث المساجد التي تشد اليها الرحال، فقد ذكر النبي ان المساجد الثلاثه الوحيده التي تشد اليها الرحال هي: المسجد الحرام، والمسجد النبوي، والمسجد الاقصى.\n\nوكلها احاديث تدل على مكانه

قامت بعده حفريات خارج ساحات المسجد الاقصى او كما تسميه بجبل الهيكل. وفي عام 1970م، بدات السلطات الاسرائيليه بحفريات مكثفه خارج الاسوار بجوار المسجد على الجانبين الجنوبي والغربي. ويعتقد الفلسطينيون ان انفاقا حفرت تحت المسجد الاقصى من اجل تقويض اساساته، وهو الامر الذي نفته القوات الاسرائيليه، وقد زعموا ان اقرب الحفريات الى المسجد كانت نحو 70 مترا الى الجنوب منها. كما قام الاسرائيليون بحفر نفق بالقرب من الجزء الغربي من المسجد عام 1984م. ووفقاً لمبعوث اليونسكو الخاص بالقدس اوليغ غرابار، ذكر ان المباني والهياكل في الحرم القدسي اخذه في التدهور ويرجع ذلك اساسا الى النزاعات بين الاسرائيليين والفلسطينيين والحكومه الاردنيه حول من هو المسؤول عن هذا الموقع.\nفي 2007م قام الاسرائيليون بحفريات جديده للكشف عن اثار مزعومه على بعد 60 مترًا من الحرم القدسي، وقد اثارت هذه الحفريات غضب العالم الاسلامي، واتهموا الاسرائيليين بمحاوله تدمير اسس المسجد. وقد دعا اسماعيل هنيه الفلسطينيين للقيام باحتجاجات ضد هذه الحفريات، بينما قالت حركه فتح انها ستنهي اتفاق وقف اطلاق النار مع اسرائيل.\n\nابرز

          "content": "The Dome of the Rock (Arabic: قبة الصخرة, romanized: Qubbat aṣ-Ṣaḵra) is an octagonal Islamic shrine at the center of the Al-Aqsa mosque compound on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is the world's oldest surviving work of Islamic architecture, the earliest archaeologically-attested religious structure to be built by a Muslim ruler and contains the earliest inscriptions proclaiming Islam and the prophet Muhammad.\nIts initial construction was undertaken by the Umayyad Caliphate on the orders of Abd al-Malik during the Second Fitna in 691–692 CE, and it has since been situated on top of the site of the Second Jewish Temple (built in c. 516 BCE to replace the destroyed Solomon's Temple and rebuilt by Herod the Great), which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. The original dome collapsed in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–23.\nIts architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces. Its outside appearance was significantly changed during the Early Ottoman period, when brightly coloured, mainly blue-and-white Iznik-style tiles were applied to the exterior, and again in the modern period, notably with the addition of the gold-plated roof, in 1959–61 and again in 1993. The octagonal plan of the structure may have been influenced by the Byzantine-era Church of the Seat of Mary (also known as Kathisma in Greek and al-Qadismu in Arabic), which was built between 451 and 458 on the road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem.\nThe Foundation Stone (or Noble Rock) that the temple was built over bears great significance in the Abrahamic religions as the place where God created the world as well as the first human, Adam. It is also believed to be the site where Abraham attempted to sacrifice his son, and as the place where God's divine presence is manifested more than in any other place, towards which Jews turn during prayer. The site's great significance for Muslims derives from traditions connecting it to the creation of the world and the belief that the Night Journey of Muhammad began from the rock at the centre of the structure.\nDesignated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, it has been called \"Jerusalem's most recognizable landmark\" along with two nearby Old City structures: the Western Wall and the \"Resurrection Rotunda\" in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Its Islamic inscriptions proved to be a milestone, as afterward they became a common feature in Islamic structures and almost always mention Muhammad. The Dome of the Rock remains a \"unique monument of Islamic culture in almost all respects\", including as a \"work of art and as a cultural and pious document\", according to art historian Oleg Grabar.\n\nArchitecture\nStructure\nThe Dome of the Rock's basic plan is essentially octagonal. It is capped at its center by a dome, approximately 20 m (66 ft) in diameter, mounted on an elevated circular drum standing on 16 supports (4 piers and 12 columns). Surrounding this circle is an octagonal arcade of 24 piers and columns. The inner circular row of drum supports and the octagonal arcade create an inner ambulatory that encircles the holy rock. The outer walls are also octagonal. They each measure approximately 60 m (200 ft) wide and 36 m (118 ft) high. The inner and outer octagon create a second, outer ambulatorium surrounding the inner one. Both the circular drum and the exterior walls contain many windows.\n\nInterior decoration\nThe interior of the dome is lavishly decorated with mosaic, faience and marble, much of which was added several centuries after its completion. The inner colonnade features ablaq light and dark stone voussoirs in its arches. The origins of these marble treatments are controversial, with some scholars theorizing them to be from the original construction, and some saying they were later additions (and differing then as to the dates and identity of the builders).\nIt also contains Qur'anic inscriptions. They vary from today's standard text (mainly changes from the first to the third person) and are mixed with pious inscriptions not in the Quran. The dedicatory inscription in Kufic script placed around the dome contains the date believed to be the year the Dome was first completed, AH 72 (691/2 CE), while the name of the corresponding caliph and builder of the Dome, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, was deleted and replaced by the name of Abbasid caliph Al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) during whose reign renovations took place.\n\nExterior decoration\nThe decoration of the outer walls went through two major phases: the initial Umayyad scheme comprised marble and mosaics, much like the interior walls. 16th-century Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent replaced it with Ottoman tile decoration. This tilework was of many different styles and techniques, including cuerda seca tiles, multi-coloured underglaze tiles, and blue-and-white tilework, resembling the Iznik tiles that were produced for the Ottoman capital. A small number of tiles were actual Iznik productions that were imported to Jerusalem. The original tiles were replaced in the 1960s with faithful copies produced in Italy.\nSurah Ya-Sin (the 'Heart of the Quran') is inscribed across the top of the tile work and was commissioned in the 16th century by Suleiman the Magnificent. Surah 17, Al-Isra', which tells the story of the Isra or Night Journey, is inscribed above this.\n\nHistory\nPre-Islamic background\nThe Dome of the Rock is situated in the center of the Temple Mount, the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Jewish Temple, which had been greatly expanded under Herod the Great in the 1st century BCE. Herod's Temple was destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans, and after the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, a Roman temple to Jupiter Capitolinus was built at the site by Emperor Hadrian.\nJerusalem was ruled by the Byzantine Empire throughout the 4th to 6th centuries. During this time, Christian pilgrimage to Jerusalem began to develop. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built under Constantine in the 320s, but the Temple Mount was left undeveloped after a failed project of restoration of the Jewish Temple under Emperor Julian.\nIn 638 CE, Byzantine Jerusalem was conquered by the Arab armies of Umar ibn al-Khattab, second Caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. Umar was advised by Ka'b al-Ahbar, a Jewish rabbi who converted to Islam, that the site is identical with the site of the former Jewish Temples in Jerusalem. Among the first Muslims, Jerusalem was referred to as Madinat bayt al-Maqdis ('City of the Temple').\n\nUmayyads\nOriginal construction\nThe initial octagonal structure of the Dome of the Rock and its round wooden dome had basically the same shape as it does today. It was built by the order of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705). According to Sibt ibn al-Jawzi (1185–1256), construction started in 685/6, while al-Suyuti (1445–1505) holds that its commencement year was 688. A dedicatory inscription in Kufic script is preserved inside the dome. The date is recorded as AH 72 (691/2 CE), the year most historians believe the construction of the original Dome was completed. An alternative interpretation of the inscription claims that it indicates the year when construction started. In this inscription, the name of \"al-Malik\" was removed and replaced by the name of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833). This alteration of the original inscription was first noted by Melchior de Vogüé in 1864. Some scholars have suggested that the dome was added to an existing building, built either by Muawiyah I (r. 661–680), or indeed a Byzantine building dating to before the Muslim conquest, built under Heraclius (r. 610–641).\nThe Dome of the Rock's architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces. The supervisor and engineer in charge of the project were Raja ibn Haywa, Yazid ibn Salam, and the latter's son Baha. Raja was a Muslim theologian and native of Beisan, and Yazid and Baha were mawali (non-Arab, Muslim converts; clients) of Abd al-Malik from Jerusalem. Abd al-Malik was represented in the supervision of the construction by his son Sa'id al-Khayr. The Caliph employed expert works from across his domain, at the time restricted to Syria and Egypt, who were presumably Christians. Construction cost was reportedly seven times the yearly tax income of Egypt. The historian K. A. C. Creswell noted that those who built the shrine used the measurements of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The diameter of the dome of the shrine is 20.20 m (66.3 ft) and its height 20.48 m (67.2 ft), while the diameter of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is 20.90 m (68.6 ft) and its height 21.05 m (69.1 ft).\n\nMotivations for construction\nNarratives by the medieval sources about Abd al-Malik's motivations in building the Dome of the Rock vary. At the time of its construction, the Caliph was engaged in war with Christian Byzantium and its Syrian Christian allies on the one hand and with the rival caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, who controlled Mecca, the annual destination of Muslim pilgrimage, on the other hand. Thus, one series of explanations was that Abd al-Malik intended for the Dome of the Rock to be a religious monument of victory over the Christians that would distinguish Islam's uniqueness within the common Abrahamic religious setting of Jerusalem, home of the two older Abrahamic faiths, Judaism and Christianity. The historian Shelomo Dov Goitein has argued that the Dome of the Rock was intended to compete with the many fine buildings of worship of other religions: \"The very form of a rotunda, given to the Qubbat as-Sakhra, although it was foreign to Islam, was destined to rival the many Christian domes\" - and more specifically, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, according to others.\nThe other main explanation holds that Abd al-Malik, in the heat of the war with Ibn al-Zubayr, sought to build the structure to divert the focus of the Muslims in his realm from the Ka'aba in Mecca, where Ibn al-Zubayr would publicly condemn the Umayyads during the annual pilgrimage to the sanctuary. Though most modern historians dismiss the latter account as a product of anti-Umayyad propaganda in the traditional Muslim sources and doubt that Abd al-Malik would attempt to alter the sacred Muslim requirement of fulfilling the pilgrimage to the Ka'aba, other historians concede that this cannot be conclusively dismissed.\n\nAbbasids and Fatimids\nThe building was severely damaged by earthquakes in 808 and again in 846. The dome collapsed in an earthquake in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–1023. The mosaics on the drum were repaired in 1027–1028. The earthquake of 1033 resulted in the introduction of wooden beams to enforce the dome.\n\nCrusaders\nFor centuries Christian pilgrims were able to come and experience the Temple Mount, but escalating violence against pilgrims to Jerusalem (Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, who ordered the destruction of the Holy Sepulchre, was an example) resulted in the Crusades. The Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099 and the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church, while the nearby Al-Aqsa main prayer hall or Qibli Mosque first became a royal palace for a while, and then for much of the 12th century the headquarters of the Knights Templar. The Templars, active from c. 1119, identified the Dome of the Rock as the site of the Temple of Solomon. The Templum Domini, as they called the Dome of the Rock, featured on the official seals of the Order's Grand Masters (such as Everard des Barres and Renaud de Vichiers), and soon became the architectural model for round Templar churches across Europe.\n\nAyyubids and Mamluks\nJerusalem was recaptured by Saladin on 2 October 1187, and the Dome of the Rock was reconsecrated as a Muslim shrine. The cross on top of the dome was replaced by a crescent, and a wooden screen was placed around the rock below. Saladin's nephew al-Malik al-Mu'azzam Isa carried out other restorations within the building, and added the porch to the Jami'a Al-Aqsa.\nThe Dome of the Rock was the focus of extensive royal patronage by the sultans during the Mamluk period, which lasted from 1260 until 1516.\n\nOttoman period (1517–1917)\nDuring the Ottoman period, the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520–1566) brought Ottoman dynastic patronage to the city, around the same time that the sultan and his wife, Haseki Hürrem Sultan (Roxelana), were also commissioning works in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Suleiman initiated a major renovation of the Dome of the Rock. The most visible legacy of this work was the covering of the exterior with Ottoman-style tiles, which replaced the old Umayyad mosaics. This was likely part of an effort to impose a visibly Ottoman mark on this major Islamic holy site. Inscriptions on the tiles provide the dates 952 AH (1545–6 CE) and 959 AH (1552 CE), but work continued until the end of Suleiman's reign, if not later. Documents show repairs were still incomplete by the time of Murad III (r. 1574–1595) and the latter can probably be credited with finishing this work, which included repairs to the lead of the dome.\nThe tiles seem to have been fabricated locally rather than at centers like Iznik (famous for its production of Iznik pottery at this time), although there does not appear to have been a sophisticated ceramic production center in the region. Robert Hillenbrand remarks that the workshops that produced the tiles must have been dedicated to this project alone, because there is no evidence that similar tilework was produced for other monuments in Jerusalem during this period. The name of one of the craftsmen is recorded in an inscription as Abdallah of Tabriz. This may indicate that the tiles were commissioned from a workshop of Iranian craftsmen from Tabriz who are thought to have produced many earlier Ottoman tiles.\nThe Dome of the Chain, a free-standing structure next to the Dome of the Rock, was also renovated as part of Suleiman's project, in 1561–2. Also nearby, the Ottomans built the Dome of the Prophet in its current form sometime in the 16th or 17th century.\nFurther restorations to the building are recorded in 1720–1721, 1742,1754, 1780, 1817–1818, and 1853. In another major restoration project undertaken in 1874–1875 during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz, all the tiles on the west and southwest walls of the octagonal part of the building were removed and replaced by copies that had been made in Turkey.\n\nBritish Mandate\nHaj Amin al-Husseini, appointed Grand Mufti by the British in 1917, along with Yaqub al-Ghusayn, implemented the restoration of the Dome of the Rock and the Jami Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem.\nParts of the Dome of the Rock collapsed during the 11 July 1927 earthquake, and the walls were left badly cracked, damaging many of the repairs that had taken place over previous years.\n\nJordanian rule\nIn 1955, an extensive program of renovation was begun by the government of Jordan, with funds supplied by Arab governments and Turkey. The work included replacement of large numbers of tiles dating back to the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, which had become dislodged by heavy rain. In 1965, as part of this restoration, the dome was covered with a durable aluminium bronze alloy made in Italy that replaced the lead exterior. Before 1959, the dome was covered in blackened lead. In the course of substantial restoration carried out from 1959 to 1962, the lead was replaced by aluminum-bronze plates covered with gold leaf.\n\nIsraeli rule\nA few hours after the Israeli flag was hoisted over the Dome of the Rock in 1967 during the Six-Day War, Israelis lowered it on the orders of Moshe Dayan and invested the Muslim waqf (religious trust) with the authority to manage the Temple Mount in order to \"keep the peace\".\nIn 1993, the golden dome covering was refurbished following a donation of US$8.25 million by King Hussein of Jordan, who sold one of his houses in London to fund the 80 kilograms (180 lb) of gold required.\n\nAccessibility\nThe Dome is maintained by the Ministry of Awqaf in Amman, Jordan.\nUntil the mid-20th century, non-Muslims were not permitted in the area. Since 1967, non-Muslims have been permitted limited access; however non-Muslims are not permitted to pray on the Temple Mount, bring prayer books, or wear religious apparel. The Israeli police help enforce this. Israel restricted access for a short time during 2012 of Palestinian residents of the West Bank to the Temple Mount. West Bank Palestinian men had to be over 35 to be eligible for a permit. Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, who hold Israeli residency cards, and Palestinians with Israeli citizenship are permitted unrestricted access.\nSome Orthodox rabbis encourage Jews to visit the site, while most forbid entry to the compound lest there be a violation of Jewish law. Even rabbis who encourage entrance to the Temple Mount prohibit entrance to the actual Dome of the Rock.\n\nReligious significance\nThe location of the Dome of the Rock is believed by many Muslims to be the site mentioned in Sura 17 of the Qur'an, which tells the story of the Isra and Mi'raj, the mythical Night Journey of Muhammad from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Masjid Al-Aqsa (\"the farthest place of prayer\") where he prayed, and then to visit heaven where he leads prayers and rises to heaven to receive instructions from Allah. Although the city of Jerusalem is not mentioned by any of its names in the Qur'an, it is mentioned in hadiths as the place of Muhammad's Night Journey.\nJudging though by the early Muslim sources, this does not seem to have been yet a fully formulated part of the beliefs shared by Muslims during the construction of the Dome in the 8th century, and the inscriptions inside the dome attributing the building to Caliph 'Abd al-Malik in the year 691/2 do not refer at all to the Night Journey, but contain only the Quranic view on the nature of the prophet Isa (Jesus) instead. The inscription is in a mosaic frieze that includes an explicit rejection of the divinity of Christ:\n\n33. \"So peace is upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!\" 34. Such is Jesus, son of Mary. It is a statement of truth, about which they doubt. 35. It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should take himself a child. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it, \"Be\", and it is.\nAccording to Goitein, the inscriptions decorating the interior clearly display a spirit of polemic against Christianity, whilst stressing at the same time the Qur'anic doctrine that Jesus was a true prophet. The formula la sharika lahu ('God has no companion') is repeated five times; the verses from Sura Maryam 19:35–37, which strongly reaffirm Jesus' prophethood to God, are quoted together with the prayer: Allahumma salli ala rasulika wa'abdika 'Isa bin Maryam – \"O Lord, send your blessings to your Prophet and Servant Jesus son of Mary.\" He believes that this shows that rivalry with Christendom, together with the spirit of Muslim mission to the Christians, was at work at the time of construction.\nAt the beginning of the 8th century, Ibn Ishaq codified the earliest Arabic source pertaining to the Jerusalem Rock, as part of his Sirat al-Nabi, a biography of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, introducing the notion that right after his Night Journey from Mecca to Jerusalem (isra'), he set off immediately and specifically from the Rock in his Ascension (mi'raj) to Heaven, where God instructed him in the doctrines of the new religion.\nToday, many Muslims believe the Dome serves for the commemoration of Muhammad's Ascension, in accordance to the views shared by some Islamic scholars, that the Rock is indeed the spot from which Muhammad ascended to Heaven accompanied by the angel Gabriel. Further, Muhammad was taken here by Gabriel to pray with Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.\n\nOther Islamic scholars believe that Muhammad ascended to Heaven from the Masjid Al-Aqsa, of which the Dome of the Rock is a part.\nIn traditional Jewish sources, it is believed to be the place from which the creation of the world began. Moreover, many Jews believe the site to be where Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac. The Foundation Stone and its surroundings which lie at the center of the dome, are considered the holiest site in Judaism. Jews traditionally regard the location of the stone as the holiest spot on Earth, the site of the Holy of Holies of the First and the Second Temple.\nThough Muslims now pray towards the Kaaba at Mecca, they once faced the Temple Mount as the Jews do; Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad led prayers towards Jerusalem until the 16th or 17th month after his migration from Mecca to Medina, when Allah directed him to instead turn towards the Kaaba in Mecca.\nThe Temple Institute wishes to relocate the Dome to another site and replace it with a Third Temple, a vision in line with the New Jerusalem prophecy. Some religious Jews, following rabbinic teaching, believe that the Temple should only be rebuilt in the messianic era, and that it would be presumptuous of people to force God's hand. However, some Evangelical Christians consider rebuilding of the Temple to be a prerequisite to Armageddon and the Second Coming. Jeremy Gimpel, a US-born candidate for The Jewish Home political party in the 2013 Israeli elections, caused a controversy when he was recorded telling a Fellowship Church evangelical group in Florida in 2011 to imagine the incredible experience that would follow were the Dome to be destroyed and the construction of the Third Temple begun. All evangelicals would immediately rush to go to Israel, he opined.\n\nInfluence and depiction\nHomages in art and architecture\nIt was long believed that the Dome of the Rock echoed the architecture of the Temple in Jerusalem, as can be seen in Raphael's The Marriage of the Virgin and in Perugino's Marriage of the Virgin.\nFor the same reason, the Dome of the Rock has inspired the architecture of a number of buildings. These include the 15th-century octagonal Church of St. Giacomo in Italy, the 19th-century octagonal Moorish Revival-style Rumbach Street Synagogue in Budapest, as well as the Mausoleum of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in Istanbul and the New Synagogue in Berlin, Germany.\n\nOn banknotes\nThe Dome of the Rock has been depicted on the obverse and reverse of several Middle Eastern currencies:\n\nGallery\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\nCreswell, K.A.C.

          "summary": "The Dome of the Rock (Arabic: قبة الصخرة, romanized: Qubbat aṣ-Ṣaḵra) is an octagonal Islamic shrine at the center of the Al-Aqsa mosque compound on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is the world's oldest surviving work of Islamic architecture, the earliest archaeologically-attested religious structure to be built by a Muslim ruler and contains the earliest inscriptions proclaiming Islam and the prophet Muhammad.\nIts initial construction was undertaken by the Umayyad Caliphate on the orders of Abd al-Malik during the Second Fitna in 691–692 CE, and it has since been situated on top of the site of the Second Jewish Temple (built in c. 516 BCE to replace the destroyed Solomon's Temple and rebuilt by Herod the Great), which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. The original dome collapsed in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–23.\nIts architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces. Its outside appearance was significantly changed during the Early Ottoman period, when brightly coloured, mainly blue-and-white Iznik-style tiles were applied to the exterior, and again in the modern period, notably with the addition of the gold-plated roof, in 1959–61 and again in 1993. The octagonal plan of the structure may have been influenced by the Byzantine-era Church of the Seat of Mary (also known as Kathisma in Greek and al-Qadismu in Arabic), which was built between 451 and 458 on the road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem.\nThe Foundation Stone (or Noble Rock) that the temple was built over bears great significance in the Abrahamic religions as the place where God created the world as well as the first human, Adam. It is also believed to be the site where Abraham attempted to sacrifice his son, and as the place where God's divine presence is manifested more than in any other place, towards which Jews turn during prayer. The site's great significance for Muslims derives from traditions connecting it to the creation of the world and the belief that the Night Journey of Muhammad began from the rock at the centre of the structure.\nDesignated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, it has been called \"Jerusalem's most recognizable landmark\" along with two nearby Old City structures: the Western Wall and the \"Resurrection Rotunda\" in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Its Islamic inscriptions proved to be a milestone, as afterward they became a common feature in Islamic structures and almost always mention Muhammad. The Dome of the Rock remains a \"unique monument of Islamic culture in almost all respects\", including as a \"work of art and as a cultural and pious document\", according to art historian Oleg Grabar.",

في العالم، اذ تُعتبر قبّته من اهم وابرز المعالم المعماريه الاسلاميه، كما ويُعتبر اقدم بناء اسلامي بقي مُحافظا على شكله وزخرفته. بنى هذا المسجد والقبّه الخليفه عبد الملك بن مروان، حيث بدا في بنائها عام 66هـ الموافق 685م، وانتهى منها عام 72هـ الموافق 691م، واشرف على بنائها المهندسان رجاء بن حيوه الكندي، وهو من التابعين المعروفين، ويزيد بن سلام مولى عبد الملك بن مروان. وقبّه الصخره عباره عن بناء مثمن الاضلاع له اربعه ابواب، وفي داخله تثمينه اخرى تقوم على دعامات واعمده اسطوانيه، في داخلها دائره تتوسطها «الصخره المُشرفه» التي عرج منها النبي محمد الى السماء في رحله الاسراء والمعراج،\nوترتفع هذه الصخره نحو 1,5 متراً عن ارضيه البناء، وهي غير منتظمه الشكل، ويتراوح قطرها بين 13 و 18 متراً، وتعلو الصخره في الوسط قبّه دائريه قطرها حوالي 20 متراً، مطليه من الخارج بالواح الذهب، ارتفاعها 35 متراً، يعلوها هلال بارتفاع خمسه امتار.\nويذكر بعض العلماء ان الكنائس التي بناها فرسان الهيكل فيما بعد، تاثرت باسلوب العماره الاسلاميه وبنمط قبه الصخره، ويظهر ذلك جليًا في قلعه كاستل دل مونتي الايطاليه.\nتعتبر قبه الصخره المشرفه احدى اهم المعالم الاسلاميه في العالم، فاضافه الى مكانتها وقدسيتها الدينيه، فهي اقدم نموذج في العماره الاسلاميه، ولما تحمله من روعه فنيه وجماليه تطوي بين زخارفها بصمات الحضاره الاسلاميه على مر فتراتها المتتابعه، حيث جلبت انتباه واهتمام الباحثين والزائرين من كل البقاع، لما امتازت به من تناسق وانسجام عناصرها المعماريه والزخرفيه، حتى اعتبرت ايه في الهندسه المعماريه.\nوقد اهتم المسلمون برعايه وعنايه قبه الصخره المشرفه، على مر الفترات الاسلاميه المتعاقبه، خاصه بعد كل خراب له جراء التاثيرات الطبيعيه، من هزات ارضيه او عواصف او امطار او حرائق، فلم يتاخر اي خليفه او سلطان في ترميمها والحفاظ عليها.\n\nتاريخ\nبنى الخليفه الاموي عبد الملك بن مروان المصلى عام 72هـ لاستقطاب المسلمين الى هذه البقعه المقدسه، بعد نقل عاصمه الخلافه من المدينه المنوره الى دمشق واقامه الامويين في بلاد الشام. ويقع المصلى وسط هضبه صخريه واسعه تسمى الحرم الشريف ويقع على امتداد محوره الجامع القبلي.\nتعد قبه الصخره من اهم معالم المسجد الاقصى المبارك، وقد شرع في انشائه عبد الملك بن مروان الخليفه الاموي الخامس، سنه 68هـ\\688م، حول الصخره المشرفه الواقعه على صحن مرتفع وسط ساحه الحرم الشريف، وانتهى بناؤها عام 72هـ\\691م.\nوقد اقام عبد الملك فوقها بناء مستديرًا، مكونًا من قبه خشبيه مرتكزه على رقبه مستديره الشكل، محاطه بست عشره نافذه. وهذه الرقبه مستنده على رواق مستدير، محموله على اربعه اركان من الرخام الابيض المشجر، واثني عشر عمودًا موزعه، بحيث يعقب كل ركن ثلاثه اعمده. ويتكون باقي البناء الذي في ظاهر الرواق الداخلي المستدير من مطافين يحوطان به. وهما منفصلان، احدهما عن الاخر، برواق وسطي مثمن الشكل، محمول على ثمانيه اركان، مؤزره بالرخام المشجر والملون البديع، وسته عشر عمودًا موزعه بحيث يعقب كل ركن عمودان. ويربط الاركان والعمد التي بينها بساطل وهو رابط خشبي ملبس بالنحاس الاصفر المذهب المنقوش. وتعلو البساطلَ قناطرُ كلها مزينه بالفص المذهب البديع المزين بانواع التشجير والتنميق. وقد نص على هذه القناطر سقف مائل من الخشب، دهن باطنه باشكال هندسيه ظريفه، وصفح من الظاهر بانواع الرصاص. ويشغل باقي المساحه مطاق خارجي يقع بين الرواق الوسطي وجدران البناء الخارجيه التي تتخذ شكلًا مثمنًا، ولكل ضلع من اضلاعه المقابله للجهات الاربع باب. وعلى بعد بضعه امتار خارج الباب الشرقي تقوم فيه السلسله. وهي بناء جميل كثير الشبه بقبه الصخره مما جعل بعض الدارسين يعتقد انه بني كاُنْموذَجٍ لها.\nوجدير بالذكر، ان جميع الدراسات والاختبارات الاثريه الكثيره التي اجراها علماء مختصون على البناء، خلال عمليات الصيانه والترميم على مدى الازمان، اثبتت بما لا يدع مجالًا لاي شك، ان قبه الصخره، بكامل اساساتها وجدرانها الخارجيه، هي من انشاء عبد الملك بن مروان، وانها بناء متجانس الاجزاء، لا يضم بقايا اي بناء قديم كما توهم بعضهم.\n\nالتسميه\nسُميَّ مسجد قبه الصخره بهذا الاسم نسبهً الى الصخره المُشرفه التي عرج منها النبي محمد في رحله الاسراء والمعراج. ان قبه الصخره اثر هام في تاريخ العماره الاسلاميه مرتبط بكل مسلم وبعقيدته في الاسراء والمعراج، وهي في العماره الاسلاميه اقدم اثر باق يشهد على نشاه فن العماره الاسلاميه، وعلى جمال زخرفه هذا الفن الجديد، وقبه الصخره اثر يشهد لبانيه خليفه المسلمين الاموي عبد الملك بن مروان بجهده ويوضع لبنه اولى في صرح العماره الاسلاميه.\n\nالوصف\nهو بناء من الحجر على تخطيط مثمن طول ضلعه نحو 12,5 متراً، وداخل المثمن الخارجي مثمن اخر داخلي، وفي كل ضلع من اضلاعه ثلاثه عقود محموله على عمود وثمانيه اكتاف، وداخل المثمن الثاني دائره من 12 عمودا واربعه اكتاف، وفوق الدائره قبه قطرها 20,44 متراً، وارتفاع القبه الحالي يبلغ 35,30 متراً عن مستوى التربه، مرفوعه على رقبه اسطوانه فتحت بها 161 نافذه، وهي من الخشب تغطيها من الداخل طبقه من الجبص ومن الخارج طبقه من الرصاص، وللمسجد اربعه ابواب متعامده.\nاما القبب الخارجيه والداخليه فهي منظمه على هيكل مركزي، هيكل القبه الخارجيه مشبوك على اطار الاسطوانه الخارجيه، هذا الاطار مصنوع من جسور خشبيه موصوله مع بعضها لتشكل سلسله دائريه مستمره، فوق هذه الجسور توجد شبكه خشبيه يوضع عليها طبقه الغطاء الخارجيه.\nوتقع الصخره المشرفه في مركز هذا المصلى، ويعتقد العامه ان هذه الصخره معلقه بين السماء والارض وهذا اعتقاد خاطئ. ويوجد اسفل الصخره كهف به محراب قديم يطلق عليه مصلى الانبياء، ويحيط بالصخره حاجز من الخشب المعشق من تجديدات السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون عام 725هـ، وتحيط بمنطقه الصخره اربع دعامات من الحجر المغلف ببلاطات الرخام، بينها 12 عموداً من الرخام، تحمل 16 عقداً تشكل في اعلاها رقبه اسطوانيه، تقوم عليها القبه.\n\nالصخره\nهي عباره عن قطعه ضخمه من الصخر، تقع تحت القبه في وسط المصلى، طولها من الشمال الى الجنوب حوالي 18 متراً، وعرضها من الشرق الى الغرب حوالي اربعه عشر متراً، واعلى نقطه فيها مرتفعه عن الارضيه نحو متر ونصف، وحولها حاجز من الخشب المنقوش والمدهون، وحول هذا الحاجز مصلى للنساء وله اربعه ابواب، يفصل بينه وبين مصلى الرجال حاجز من الحديد المشبك.\n\nالمغاره\nتقع تحت الصخره مغاره يطلق عليها اسم مغاره الارواح، وينزل اليها من الناحيه الجنوبيه باحد عشر درجه. على شكل قريب من المربع، طول كل ضلع منه حوالي اربعه امتار ونصف. ولها سقف ارتفاعه ثلاثه امتار، به ثغره اتساعها متر واحد وعند الباب قنطره مقصوره بالرخام على عمودين.\n\nالزخرفه\nغطت معظم اروقه وجدران المصلى من الداخل بالفسيفساء وهي تظهر الفن الاسلامي في الزخرفه كي تشكل وحده فنيه منسجمه في التكوين ومتحده في الاسلوب، حيث انّ حجاره الفسيفساء كانت مصنوعه محلياً. اجمل ما في الزخرفه الايات القرانيه في اعلى اقواس المضلع المثمن الاوسط تعتبر اقدم ما كتب من الخط العربي الجميل، اطلق عليه اسم الخط الجليل. ومجموعه الالواح البرونزيه المذهبه التي تغطي بعضها اجزاء من الابواب الاربعه او الافاريز الواصله بين تيجان اعمده ارواق هي اجزاء فريده في العالم لاصالتها ولجمالها وغناها الزخرفي، وتسيطر عليها اوراق العنب والعناقيد المعالجه بمهاره متجدده.\nوقد جاء الاستغناء عن الصور الممثله للانسان والحيوان وفقًا لاحكام الديانه الاسلاميه. واستعيض عنها بالاشكال الطبيعيه والرسوم المركبه والتقليديه، مما اعطى المكان رونقًا يمتاز عن غيره بما يبعث في النفس من الشعور بالهدوء والطمانينه والتامل العميق. والزخرفه بمجموعها مكونه من اشكال متباينه مرنه التكييف، ولا شك ان الفنان الصانع لها كان امينًا في صنعه على المبادئ الاساسيه لاساليب الزخرفه التي كثيرًا ما اهملت، وهي ان تاتي الزينه والزخرفه متنافسين مع المكان الذي تجملانه. وهندسه البناء الداخليه هي التي تطلبت ان تكون الزخرفه على ما جاءت عليه.\nوصفوه القول ان قبه الصخره في هندستها وشكلها وزخرفتها كانت ولا تزال من اجمل واروع المباني التي اتحف بها العالم. وقلما يوجد في مباني العالم ما يفوقها، او يضارعها بهاء وروعه وجمالًا. فزياده على زخرفه سقوفها المذهبه وجدرانها الرخاميه ونوافذها الزجاجيه تفتن العين بالفسيفساء. وجمال تاليفها، والوانها التي جاءت كلها على احسن تناسق وانسجام، وبالاشكال المختلفه التي استعملت، والاساليب، والالوان، ودقه الصنع التي بلغت الحد الاعلى من الكمال. كل هذا جعل من قبه الصخره اثرًا فريدًا في تاريخ الفن.\nقبه الصخره المشرفه بين الحقائق والزيف\nالصخره المشرفه هي صخره طبيعيه غير منتظمه الشكل تقع في اعلى نقطه من المسجد الاقصى المبارك في موقع قلب المسجد بالضبط، وهي صخره طبيعيه تتراوح ابعادها بين حوالي 13 مترًا و18 مترًا، ويبلغ ارتفاعها حوالي المترين تقريبًا، وقد دارت حولها القصص الخياليه غير الصحيحه بشكل كبير، كمن قال انها طائره في الهواء، ومن قال انها طارت خلف النبي ، ومن قال ان لها نورًا، وغير ذلك.\nوالحقيقه انها صخره عاديه ليس فيها اي ميزه الا انها كانت قبله انبياء بني اسرائيل قبل النبي ، وقيل ان النبي عرج من فوقها للسماء ليله الاسراء والمعراج، وفيها مغاره صغيره تسمى مغاره الارواح، وهي كذلك تجويف طبيعي وليس فيه اي ميزه خارقه للعاده. وقد بنيت قبه الصخره المشرفه فوق الصخره، وهي ظاهره للعيان الى اليوم.\nوحيكت عده قصص شعبيه خياليه زائفه حول الصخره المشرفه، ذكرها كثير من العلماء، وجمعها الاستاذ عيسى القدومي في كتابه (المسجد الاقصى: الحقيقه والتاريخ)، فمما ذكر القدومي انها اخبار مكذوبه: ان الصخره من صخور الجنه، وانها سيده الصخور، وهي معلقه من كل الجهات، كما ان مياه الارض كلها تخرج من تحت هذه الصخره، وتتحول الى مرجانه بيضاء.\nونشر عنها غيرها من اكاذيب مثل ان عليها موضع قدم رسول الله محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم، وعليها اثر اصابع الملائكه، وان الماء الذي يخرج من اصل الصخره نهر من انهار الجنه، وان المياه العذبه والرياح واللواقح من تحت صخره ببيت المقدس.\nقيل ايضًا انها عرش الله الادنى، ومن تحتها بسطت الارض، وانها وسط الدنيا واوسط الارض كلها، واخيرًا ان لها مكانه الحجر الاسود في الكعبه.\nواكد الدكتور عبد الله معروف في دراسته لمعالم المسجد الاقصى ان العلماء انكروا هذا التعلق بالصخره، وبينوا انها صخره طبيعيه وجزء من المسجد الاقصى، وليس لها ايه ميزه خاصه، واكد ان تنبيه الناس الى حقيقه صخره بيت المقدس، لا يقلل من فضائل المسجد الاقصى وبيت المقدس بالبركه والفضيله، وثبت عن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم في الكتب الصحاح والسنن، الكثير من الاحاديث التي نصت على ما حباه الله تعالى من الخير والبركه، وبينت الخصائص التي تميز بها المسجد الاقصى وارضه لما لها من مكانه عظيمه ومنزله رفيعه في الشرع الاسلامي. فبركه المسجد الاقصى ثابته بالكتاب والسنه، ولنا غنى في الصحيح منها عن الموضوع والمكذوب.\nوخلاصه الامر ان اغلب ما قيل عن الصخره من اخبار خياليه اصله من الاسرائيليات، وليس له اصل في المصادر الاسلاميه الاساسيه سواء القران الكريم او الصحيح من حديث النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم. وما التركيز على هذا الامر الا بسبب انتشار كبير لبعض هذه الاخبار الزائفه بين المسلمين هذه الايام، وخاصه مساله تعليق الصخره في الهواء!\n\nمعرض الصور\nوصلات خارجيه\nفيديو لداخل قبه الصخره على يوتيوب.\nنموذج ثلاثي الابعاد لقبه الصخره.\n\nانظر ايضًا\nالمسجد الاقصى.\nالاوقاف في

          "content": "The Church of the Holy Sepulchre,  also known as the Church of the Resurrection, is a fourth-century church in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. The church is simultaneously the seat of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, and the Catholic Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. It is the holiest site in Christianity and it has been an important pilgrimage site for Christians since the fourth century.\nAccording to traditions dating to the fourth century, the church contains both the site where Jesus was crucified at Calvary, or Golgotha, and the location of Jesus's empty tomb, where he was buried and, resurrected. Both locations are considered immensely holy sites by most Christians. The church and rotunda was built under Constantine the Great in the 4th century and destroyed by al-Hakim in 1009. Al-Hakim's son allowed Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos to reconstruct the church, which was completed in 1048. After it was captured by the crusaders in 1099, it continued to undergo modifications, resulting in a significant departure from the original structure. Several renovations and restorations were made under the Ottomans. The tomb itself is enclosed by a 19th-century shrine called the Aedicule.\nWithin the church proper are the last four stations of the Cross of the Via Dolorosa, representing the final episodes of the Passion of Jesus. The church has been a major Christian pilgrimage destination since its creation in the fourth century, as the traditional site of the resurrection of Christ, thus its original Greek name, Church of the Anastasis ('Resurrection').\nThe Status Quo, an understanding between religious communities dating to 1757, applies to the site. Control of the church itself is shared among several Christian denominations and secular entities in complicated arrangements essentially unchanged for over 160 years, and some for much longer. The main denominations sharing property over parts of the church are the Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, Coptic, Syriac, and Ethiopian Orthodox churches. Directly adjacent to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is the Church of the Redeemer, marking a Lutheran presence at the site.\n\nName\nThe Church of the Holy Sepulchre is also known as the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre or simply as the Holy Sepulchre, named for the tomb of Jesus, which is at the focal point of his resurrection according to Christians. Eastern Christians also directly call it the Church of the Resurrection or the Church of the Anastasis – anástasis (ἀνάστασις) being Greek for 'resurrection'.\n\nHistory\nBackground (1st–4th centuries)\nAfter the siege of Jerusalem in AD 70 during the First Jewish–Roman War, Jerusalem had been reduced to ruins. In AD 130, the Roman emperor Hadrian began the building of a Roman colony, the new city of Aelia Capitolina, on the site. About AD 135, he ordered that a cave containing a rock-cut tomb be filled in to make a flat foundation for a temple dedicated to Jupiter or Venus. The temple remained until the early fourth century.\n\nConstantine and Macarius: context for the first sanctuary\nAfter seeing a vision of a cross in the sky in 312, Constantine the Great began to favour Christianity and signed the Edict of Milan legalizing the religion. The Bishop of Jerusalem Macarius asked Constantine for permission to dig for the tomb. With the help of Eusebius (a Bishop of Caesarea) and Macarius, three crosses were found near a tomb; one, which was said to have cured people near death, was presumed to be the True Cross, on which Jesus was crucified, leading the Romans to believe that they had found Calvary.\nAbout 326, Constantine ordered that the temple to Jupiter or Venus be replaced by a church. After the temple was torn down and its ruins removed, the soil was removed from the cave, revealing a rock-cut tomb that Macarius identified as the burial site of Jesus.\n\nFirst sanctuary (4th century)\nA shrine was built on the site of the tomb Macarius had identified as that of Jesus, enclosing the rock tomb walls within its own.\nThe Church of the Holy Sepulchre, planned by the architect Zenobius, was built as separate constructs over two holy sites:\n\na rotunda called the Anastasis ('Resurrection'), where Macarius believed Jesus to have been buried, and;\nthe great basilica (also known as Martyrium), across a courtyard to the east (an enclosed colonnaded atrium, known as the Triportico) with the traditional site of Calvary in one corner.\n\nThe Church of the Holy Sepulchre site has been recognized since early in the fourth century as the place where Jesus was crucified, buried, and rose from the dead. The church was consecrated on 13 September 335.\nIn 327, Constantine and Helena separately commissioned the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem to commemorate the birth of Jesus.\n\nDamage and destruction (614–1009)\nThe Constantinian sanctuary in Jerusalem was destroyed by a fire in May of 614, when the Sassanid Empire, under Khosrow II, invaded Jerusalem and captured the True Cross. In 630, the Emperor Heraclius rebuilt the church after recapturing the city.\nAfter Jerusalem came under Islamic rule, it remained a Christian church, with the early Muslim rulers protecting the city's Christian sites, prohibiting their destruction or use as living quarters. A story reports that the caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab visited the church and stopped to pray on the balcony, but at the time of prayer, turned away from the church and prayed outside. He feared that future generations would misinterpret this gesture, taking it as a pretext to turn the church into a mosque. Eutychius of Alexandria adds that Umar wrote a decree saying that Muslims would not inhabit this location. The building suffered severe damage from an earthquake in 746.\nEarly in the ninth century, another earthquake damaged the dome of the Anastasis. The damage was repaired in 810 by Patriarch Thomas I. In 841, the church suffered a fire. In 935, the Christians prevented the construction of a Muslim mosque adjacent to the Church. In 938, a new fire damaged the inside of the basilica and came close to the rotunda. In 966, due to a defeat of Muslim armies in the region of Syria, a riot broke out, which was followed by reprisals. The basilica was burned again. The doors and roof were burnt, and Patriarch John VII was murdered.\nOn 18 October 1009, Fatimid caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah ordered the complete destruction of the church as part of a more general campaign against Christian places of worship in Palestine and Egypt. The damage was extensive, with few parts of the early church remaining, and the roof of the rock-cut tomb damaged; the original shrine was destroyed. The tomb itself was almost completely destroyed, with only portions of the northern wall containing the burial bench and the southern wall surviving. Some partial repairs followed. Christian Europe reacted with shock: it was a spur to expulsions of Jews and, later on, used as a justification for the Crusades.\n\nReconstruction (11th century)\nIn wide-ranging negotiations between the Fatimids and the Byzantine Empire in 1027–1028, an agreement was reached whereby the new Caliph Ali az-Zahir (al-Hakim's son) agreed to allow the rebuilding and redecoration of the church. The rebuilding was finally completed during the tenures of Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos and Patriarch Nicephorus of Jerusalem in 1048. As a concession, the mosque in Constantinople was reopened and the khutba sermons were to be pronounced in az-Zahir's name. Muslim sources say a by-product of the agreement was the renunciation of Islam by many Christians who had been forced to convert under al-Hakim's persecutions. In addition, the Byzantines, while releasing 5,000 Muslim prisoners, made demands for the restoration of other churches destroyed by al-Hakim and the reestablishment of a patriarch in Jerusalem. Contemporary sources credit the emperor with spending vast sums in an effort to restore the Church of the Holy Sepulchre after this agreement was made. Still, \"a total replacement was far beyond available resources. The new construction was concentrated on the rotunda and its surrounding buildings: the great basilica remained in ruins.\"\nThe rebuilt church site consisted of \"a court open to the sky, with five small chapels attached to it.\" The chapels were east of the court of resurrection (when reconstructed, the location of the tomb was under open sky), where the western wall of the great basilica had been. They commemorated scenes from the passion, such as the location of the prison of Christ and his flagellation, and presumably were so placed because of the difficulties of free movement among shrines in the city streets. The dedication of these chapels indicates the importance of the pilgrims' devotion to the suffering of Christ. They have been described as \"a sort of Via Dolorosa in miniature\" since little or no rebuilding took place on the site of the great basilica. Western pilgrims to Jerusalem during the 11th century found much of the sacred site in ruins. Control of Jerusalem, and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, continued to change hands several times between the Fatimids and the Seljuk Turks (loyal to the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad) until the Crusaders' arrival in 1099.\n\nCrusader period (1099–1244)\nBackground\nMany historians maintain that the main concern of Pope Urban II, when calling for the First Crusade, was the threat to Constantinople from the Seljuk invasion of Asia Minor in response to the appeal of Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Historians agree that the fate of Jerusalem and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was also of concern, if not the immediate goal of papal policy in 1095. The idea of taking Jerusalem gained more focus as the Crusade was underway. The rebuilt church site was taken from the Fatimids (who had recently taken it from the Abbasids) by the knights of the First Crusade on 15 July 1099.\nThe First Crusade was envisioned as an armed pilgrimage, and no crusader could consider his journey complete unless he had prayed as a pilgrim at the Holy Sepulchre. The classical theory is that Crusader leader Godfrey of Bouillon, who became the first Latin ruler of Jerusalem, decided not to use the title \"king\" during his lifetime, and declared himself Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri ('Protector [or Defender] of the Holy Sepulchre').\nAccording to the German priest and pilgrim Ludolf von Sudheim, the keys of the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre were in hands of the \"ancient Georgians\", and the food, alms, candles and oil for lamps were given to them by the pilgrims at the south door of the church.\n\nCrusaders: reconstruction (12th century) and ownership\nBy the Crusader period, a cistern under the former basilica was rumoured to have been where Helena had found the True Cross, and began to be venerated as such; the cistern later became the Chapel of the Invention of the Cross, but there is no evidence of the site's identification before the 11th century, and modern archaeological investigation has now dated the cistern to 11th-century repairs by Monomachos.\nWilliam of Tyre, chronicler of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, reports on the rebuilding of the church in the mid-12th century. The Crusaders investigated the eastern ruins on the site, occasionally excavating through the rubble, and while attempting to reach the cistern, they discovered part of the original ground level of Hadrian's temple enclosure; they transformed this space into a chapel dedicated to Helena, widening their original excavation tunnel into a proper staircase.\n\nThe Crusaders began to refurnish the church in Romanesque style and added a bell tower. These renovations unified the small chapels on the site and were completed during the reign of Queen Melisende in 1149, placing all the holy places under one roof for the first time.\nThe church became the seat of the first Latin patriarchs and the site of the kingdom's scriptorium.\n\nEight 11th- and 12th-century Crusader leaders (Godfrey, Baldwin I, Baldwin II, Fulk, Baldwin III, Amalric, Baldwin IV and Baldwin V – the first eight rulers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem) were buried in the south transept and inside the Chapel of Adam. \nThe royal tombs were looted during the Khwarizmian sack of Jerusalem in 1244 but probably remained mostly intact until 1808 when a fire damaged the church. The tombs may have been destroyed by the fire, or during renovations by the Greek Orthodox custodians of the church in 1809–1810. The remains of the kings may still be in unmarked pits under the church's pavement.\nThe church was lost to Saladin, along with the rest of the city, in 1187, although the treaty established after the Third Crusade allowed Christian pilgrims to visit the site. Emperor Frederick II (r. 1220–50) regained the city and the church by treaty in the 13th century while under a ban of excommunication, with the consequence that the holiest church in Christianity was laid under interdict. The church seems to have been largely in the hands of Greek Orthodox patriarch Athanasius II of Jerusalem (c. 1231–47) during the last period of Latin control over Jerusalem. Both city and church were captured by the Khwarezmians in 1244.\n\nOttoman period\nThere was certainly a recognisable Nestorian (Church of the East) presence at the Holy Sepulchre from the years 1348 through 1575, as contemporary Franciscan accounts indicate. The Franciscan friars renovated the church in 1555, as it had been neglected despite increased numbers of pilgrims. The Franciscans rebuilt the Aedicule, extending the structure to create an antechamber. A marble shrine commissioned by Friar Boniface of Ragusa was placed to envelop the remains of Christ's tomb, probably to prevent pilgrims from touching the original rock or taking small pieces as souvenirs. A marble slab was placed over the limestone burial bed where Jesus's body is believed to have lain.\n\nAfter the renovation of 1555, control of the church oscillated between the Franciscans and the Orthodox, depending on which community could obtain a favourable firman from the \"Sublime Porte\" at a particular time, often through outright bribery. Violent clashes were not uncommon. There was no agreement about this question, although it was discussed at the negotiations to the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699. During the Holy Week of 1757, Orthodox Christians reportedly took over some of the Franciscan-controlled church. This may have been the cause of the sultan's firman (decree) later developed into the Status Quo.\nA fire severely damaged the structure again in 1808, causing the dome of the rotunda to collapse and smashing the Aedicule's exterior decoration. The rotunda and the Aedicule's exterior were rebuilt in 1809–10 by architect Nikolaos Ch. Komnenos of Mytilene in the contemporary Ottoman Baroque style. The interior of the antechamber, now known as the Chapel of the Angel, was partly rebuilt to a square ground plan in place of the previously semicircular western end.\nAnother decree in 1853 from the sultan solidified the existing territorial division among the communities and solidified the Status Quo for arrangements to \"remain in their present state\", requiring consensus to make even minor changes.\n\nThe dome was restored by Catholics, Greeks, and Turks in 1868, being made of iron ever since.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nBy the time of the British Mandate for Palestine following the end of World War I, the cladding of red limestone applied to the Aedicule by Komnenos had deteriorated badly and was detaching from the underlying structure; from 1947 until restoration work in 2016–17, it was held in place with an exterior scaffolding of iron girders installed by the British authorities.\n\nJordanian and Israeli periods\nIn 1948, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan and where the church was located, in the Old City, were made part of Jordan. In 1967, Israeli forces captured East Jerusalem in the Six Day War, and that area has remained under Israeli control ever since. Under Israeli rule, legal arrangements relating to the churches of East Jerusalem were maintained in coordination with the Jordanian government. The dome at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was restored again in 1994–97 as part of extensive modern renovations that have been ongoing since 1959. During the 1970–78 restoration works and excavations inside the building, and under the nearby Muristan bazaar, it was found that the area was originally a quarry, from which white meleke limestone was struck. Blocks of Meleke limestone were extracted from the quarry and their traces can be seen on the surfaces of floors, walls and the ceiling in the Chapel of St. Vartan\n\nChapel of St. Vartan\nEast of the Chapel of Saint Helena, the excavators discovered a void containing a fourth-century drawing of a Roman pilgrim ship, two low walls supporting the platform of Hadrian's second-century temple, and a higher fourth-century wall built to support Constantine's basilica. After the excavations of the early 1970s, the Armenian authorities converted this archaeological space into the Chapel of Saint Vartan, and created an artificial walkway over the quarry on the north of the chapel, so that the new chapel could be accessed (by permission) from the Chapel of Saint Helena.\n\nAedicule restoration\nAfter seven decades of being held together by steel girders, the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) declared the visibly deteriorating Aedicule structure unsafe. A restoration of the Aedicule was agreed upon and executed from May 2016 to March 2017. Much of the $4 million project was funded by the World Monuments Fund, as well as $1.3 million from Mica Ertegün and a significant sum from King Abdullah II of Jordan. The existence of the original limestone cave walls within the Aedicule was confirmed, and a window was created to view this from the inside. The presence of moisture led to the discovery of an underground shaft resembling an escape tunnel carved into the bedrock, seeming to lead from the tomb. For the first time since at least 1555, on 26 October 2016, marble cladding that protects the supposed burial bed of Jesus was removed. Members of the National Technical University of Athens were present. Initially, only a layer of debris was visible. This was cleared in the next day, and a partially broken marble slab with a Crusader-style cross carved was revealed. By the night of 28 October, the original limestone burial bed was shown to be intact. The tomb was resealed shortly thereafter. Mortar from just above the burial bed was later dated to the mid-fourth century.\n\n2020 pandemic\nOn 25 March 2020, Israeli health officials ordered the site closed to the public due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the keeper of the keys, it was the first such closure since 1349, during the Black Death. Clerics continued regular prayers inside the building, and it reopened to visitors two months later, on 24 May.\n\nCrusader altar slab discovered (2022)\nDuring church renovations in 2022, a stone slab covered in modern graffiti was moved from a wall, revealing Cosmatesque-style decoration on one face. According to an IAA archaeologist, the decoration was once inlaid with pieces of glass and fine marble; it indicates that the relic was the front of the church's high altar from the Crusader era (c. 1149), which was later used by the Greek Orthodox until being damaged in the 1808 fire.\n\nDescription\nParvis (courtyard)\nThe courtyard facing the entrance to the church is known as the parvis. Two streets open into the parvis: St Helena Road (west) and Suq ed-Dabbagha (east). Around the parvis are a few smaller structures.\nSouth of the parvis, opposite the churchBroken columns—once forming part of an arcade—stand opposite the church, at the top of a short descending staircase stretching over the entire breadth of the parvis. In the 13th century, the tops of the columns were removed and sent to Mecca by the Khwarezmids.\n\nThe Gethsemane Metochion, a small Greek Orthodox monastery (metochion).\nOn the eastern side of the parvis, south to north:\n\nThe Monastery of St Abraham (Greek Orthodox), next to the Suq ed-Dabbagha entrance to the parvis.\nThe Chapel of St John the Evangelist (Armenian Orthodox)\nThe Chapel of St Michael and the Chapel of the Four Living Creatures (both are disputed between the Copts and Ethiopians), giving access to Deir es-Sultan (also disputed), a rooftop monastery surrounding the dome of the Chapel of St Helena.\nNorth of the parvis, in front of the church façade or against it:\n\n Chapel of the Franks (Chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows): a blue-domed Roman Catholic Crusader chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows, which once provided exclusive access to Calvary. The chapel marks the 10th Station of the Cross (the stripping of Jesus's garments).\nOratory of St. Mary of Egypt: a Greek Orthodox oratory and chapel, directly beneath the Chapel of the Franks, dedicated to St. Mary of Egypt.\nThe tomb (including a ledgerstone) of Philip d'Aubigny (died 1236), a knight, tutor, and royal councillor to Henry III of England and signer of Magna Carta—is placed in front of, and between, the church's two original entrance doors, of which the eastern one is walled up. It is one of the few tombs of crusaders and other Europeans not removed from the Church after the Khwarizmian capture of Jerusalem in 1244. In the 1900s, during a fight between the Greeks and Latins, some monks damaged the tomb by throwing stones from the roof. A stone marker was placed on his tomb in 1925, sheltered by a wooden trapdoor that hides it from view.\nA group of three chapels borders the parvis on its west side. They originally formed the baptistery complex of the Constantinian church. The southernmost chapel was the vestibule, the middle chapel the baptistery, and the north chapel the chamber in which the patriarch chrismated the newly baptized before leading them into the rotunda north of this complex. Now they are dedicated as (from south to north)\n\nThe Chapel of St. James the Just (Greek Orthodox),\nThe Chapel of St. John the Baptist (Greek Orthodox),\nThe Chapel of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste (Greek Orthodox; at the base of the bell tower).\n\nBell tower\nThe 12th-century Crusader bell tower is just south of the Rotunda, to the left of the entrance. Its upper level was lost in a 1545 collapse. In 1719, another two storeys were lost.\n\nFaçade and entrance\nThe wooden doors that compose the main entrance are the original, highly carved arched doors. Today, only the left-hand entrance is currently accessible, as the right doorway has long since been bricked up. The entrance to the church leads to the south transept, through the crusader façade in the parvis of a larger courtyard. This is found past a group of streets winding through the outer Via Dolorosa by way of a souq in the Muristan. This narrow way of access to such a large structure has proven to be hazardous at times. For example, when a fire broke out in 1840, dozens of pilgrims were trampled to death.\nAccording to their own family lore, the Muslim Nuseibeh family has been responsible for opening the door as an impartial party to the church's denominations already since the seventh century. However, they themselves admit that the documents held by various Christian denominations only mention their role since the 12th century, in the time of Saladin, which is the date more generally accepted. After retaking Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187, Saladin entrusted the Joudeh family with the key to the church, which is made of iron and 30 centimetres (12 in) long; the Nuseibehs either became or remained its doorkeepers.\nThe 'immovable ladder' stands beneath a window on the façade.\n\nCalvary (Golgotha)\nJust inside the church entrance is a stairway leading up to Calvary (Golgotha), traditionally regarded as the site of Jesus's crucifixion and the most lavishly decorated part of the church. The exit is via another stairway opposite the first, leading down to the ambulatory. Golgotha and its chapels are just south of the main altar of the catholicon.\nCalvary is split into two chapels: one Greek Orthodox and one Catholic, each with its own altar. On the left (north) side, the Greek Orthodox chapel's altar is placed over the supposed rock of Calvary (the 12th Station of the Cross), which can be touched through a hole in the floor beneath the altar. The rock can be seen under protective glass on both sides of the altar. The softer surrounding stone was removed when the church was built. The Roman Catholic (Franciscan) Chapel of the Nailing of the Cross (the 11th Station of the Cross) stretches to the south. \nBetween the Catholic Altar of the Nailing to the Cross and the Orthodox altar is the Catholic Altar of the Stabat Mater, which has a statue of Mary with an 18th-century bust; this middle altar marks the 13th Station of the Cross.\n\nOn the ground floor, just underneath the Golgotha chapel, is the Chapel of Adam. According to tradition, Jesus was crucified over the place where Adam's skull was buried. According to some, the blood of Christ ran down the cross and through the rocks to fill Adam's skull. Through a window at the back of the 11th-century apse, the rock of Calvary can be seen with a crack traditionally held to be caused by the earthquake that followed Jesus's death; some scholars claim it is the result of quarrying against a natural flaw in the rock.\nBehind the Chapel of Adam is the Greek Treasury (Treasury of the Greek Patriarch). Some of its relics, such as a 12th-century crystal mitre, were transferred to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate Museum (the Patriarchal Museum) on Greek Orthodox Patriarchate Street.\n\nStone of Anointing\nJust inside the entrance to the church is the Stone of Anointing (also Stone of the Anointing or Stone of Unction), which tradition holds to be where Jesus's body was prepared for burial by Joseph of Arimathea, though this tradition is only attested since the crusader era (notably by the Italian Dominican pilgrim Riccoldo da Monte di Croce in 1288), and the present stone was only added in the 1810 reconstruction.\nThe wall behind the stone is defined by its striking blue balconies and taphos symbol-bearing red banners (depicting the insignia of the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre), and is decorated with lamps. The modern mosaic along the wall depicts the anointing of Jesus's body, preceded on the right by the Descent from the Cross, and succeeded on the left by the Burial of Jesus.\nThe wall was a temporary addition to support the arch above it, which had been weakened after the damage in the 1808 fire; it blocks the view of the rotunda, separates the entrance from the catholicon, sits on top of four of the now empty and desecrated Crusader graves and is no longer structurally necessary. Opinions differ as to whether it is to be seen as the 13th Station of the Cross, which others identify as the lowering of Jesus from the cross and located between the 11th and 12th stations on Calvary.\nThe lamps that hang over the Stone of Unction, adorned with cross-bearing chain links, are contributed by Armenians, Copts, Greeks and Latins.\nImmediately inside and to the left of the entrance is a bench (formerly a divan) that has traditionally been used by the church's Muslim doorkeepers, along with some Christian clergy, as well as electrical wiring. To the right of the entrance is a wall along the ambulatory containing the staircase leading to Golgotha. Further along the same wall is the entrance to the Chapel of Adam.\n\nRotunda and Aedicule\nThe rotunda is the building of the larger dome located on the far west side. In the centre of the rotunda is a small chapel called the Aedicule in English, from the Latin aedicula, in reference to a small shrine. The Aedicule has two rooms: the first holds a relic called the Angel's Stone, which is believed to be a fragment of the large stone that sealed the tomb; the second, smaller room contains the tomb of Jesus. Possibly to prevent pilgrims from removing bits of the original rock as souvenirs, by 1555, a surface of marble cladding was placed on the tomb to prevent further damage to the tomb. In October 2016, the top slab was pulled back to reveal an older, partially broken marble slab with a Crusader-style cross carved in it. Beneath it, the limestone burial bed was revealed to be intact.\nUnder the Status Quo, the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Armenian Apostolic Churches all have rights to the interior of the tomb, and all three communities celebrate the Divine Liturgy or Holy Mass there daily. It is also used for other ceremonies on special occasions, such as the Holy Saturday ceremony of the Holy Fire led by the Greek Orthodox patriarch (with the participation of the Coptic and Armenian patriarchs). To its rear, in the Coptic Chapel, constructed of iron latticework, lies the altar used by the Coptic Orthodox. Historically, the Georgians also retained the key to the Aedicule.\nTo the right of the sepulchre on the northwestern edge of the rotunda is the Chapel of the Apparition, which is reserved for Roman Catholic use.\nThough not within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre compound, directly adjacent to it is the Church of the Redeemer, marking a Lutheran presence at the site.\n\nCatholicon\nIn the central nave of the Crusader-era church, just east of the larger rotunda, is the Crusader structure housing the main altar of the Church, today the Greek Orthodox catholicon. Its dome is 19.8 metres (65 ft) in diameter, and is set directly over the centre of the transept crossing of the choir where the compas is situated, an omphalos (\"navel\") stone once thought to be the center of the world and still venerated as such by Orthodox Christians (associated with the site of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection).\nSince 1996 this dome is topped by the monumental Golgotha Crucifix, which the Greek Patriarch Diodoros I of Jerusalem consecrated. It was at the initiative of Israeli professor Gustav Kühnel to erect a new crucifix at the church that would not only be worthy of the singularity of the site, but that would also become a symbol of the efforts of unity in the community of Christian faith.\nThe catholicon's iconostasis demarcates the Orthodox sanctuary behind it, to its east.\nThe iconostasis is flanked to the front by two episcopal thrones: the southern seat (cathedra) is the patriarchal throne of the Greek Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem, and the northern seat is for an archbishop or bishop. (There is also a popular claim that both are patriarchal thrones, with the northern one being for the patriarch of Antioch – which has been described as a misstatement, however.)\n\nArmenian monastery south of the Aedicule\nSouth of the Aedicule is the \"Place of the Three Marys\", marked by a stone canopy (the Station of the Holy Women) and a large modern wall mosaic. From here one can enter the Armenian monastery, which stretches over the ground and first upper floor of the church's southeastern part.\n\nSyriac Chapel with Tomb of Joseph of Arimathea\nWest of the Aedicule, to the rear of the Rotunda, is the Syriac Chapel with the Tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, located in a Constantinian apse and containing an opening to an ancient Jewish rock-cut tomb. This chapel is where the Syriac Orthodox celebrate their Liturgy on Sundays.\nThe Syriac Orthodox Chapel of Saint Joseph of Arimathea and Saint Nicodemus. On Sundays and feast days it is furnished for the celebration of Mass. It is accessed from the Rotunda, by a door west of the Aedicule.\n\nFirst-century tomb\nOn the far side of the chapel is the low entrance to an almost complete first-century Jewish tomb, initially holding six kokh-type funeral shafts radiating from a central chamber, two of which are still exposed. Although this space was discovered relatively recently and contains no identifying marks, some believe that Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were buried here. Since Jews always buried their dead outside the city, the presence of this tomb seems to prove that the Holy Sepulchre site was outside the city walls at the time of the crucifixion.\n\nFranciscan area north of the Aedicule\nThe Franciscan Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene – The chapel, an open area, indicates the place where Mary Magdalene met Jesus after his resurrection.\nThe Franciscan Chapel of the Apparition (Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament), directly north of the above – in memory of Jesus's meeting with his mother after the Resurrection, a non-scriptural tradition. Here stands a piece of an ancient column, allegedly part of the one Jesus was tied to during his scourging.\n\nArches of the Virgin\nThe Arches of the Virgin are seven arches (an arcade) at the northern end of the north transept, which is to the catholicon's north. \nDisputed by the Orthodox and the Latin, the area is used to store ladders. \nOver the years the Greek-Orthodox patriarchate placed several icons along the arcade. Dating mostly to the 19th century and designed in Orthodox Post-Byzantine style, they were restored in 2021.\n\nPrison of Christ\nIn the northeast side of the complex, there is the Prison of Christ, alleged to be where Jesus was held. The Greek Orthodox are showing pilgrims yet another place where Jesus was allegedly held, the similarly named Prison of Christ in their Monastery of the Praetorium, located near the Church of Ecce Homo, between the Second and Third Stations of the Via Dolorosa. The Armenians regard a recess in the Monastery of the Flagellation at the Second Station of the Via Dolorosa as the Prison of Christ. A cistern among the ruins beneath the Church of St. Peter in Gallicantu on Mount Zion is also alleged to have been the Prison of Christ. To reconcile the traditions, some allege that Jesus was held in the Mount Zion cell in connection with his trial by the Jewish high priest, at the Praetorium in connection with his trial by the Roman governor Pilate, and near the Golgotha before crucifixion.\n\nAmbulatory\nThe chapels in the ambulatory are, from north to south: the Greek Chapel of Saint Longinus (named after Longinus), the Armenian Chapel of the Division of Robes, the entrance to the Chapel of Saint Helena, and the Greek Chapel of the Derision.\n\nChapel of Saint Helena\nChapel of Saint Helena – between the Chapel of the Division of Robes and the Greek Chapel of the Derision are stairs descending to the Chapel of Saint Helena. The Armenians, who own it, call it the Chapel of St. Gregory the Illuminator, after the saint who brought Christianity to the Armenians.\n\nChapel of Saint Vartan\nChapel of St Vartan (or Vardan) Mamikonian – on the north side of the Chapel of Saint Helena is an ornate wrought iron door, beyond which a raised artificial platform affords views of the quarry, and which leads to the Chapel of Saint Vartan. The latter chapel contains archaeological remains from Hadrian's temple and Constantine's basilica. These areas are open only on request.\n\nChapel of the Invention of the Holy Cross\nChapel of the Invention of the Cross (named for the Invention (Finding) of the Holy Cross) – another set of 22 stairs from the Chapel of Saint Helena leads down to the Roman Catholic Chapel of the Invention of the Holy Cross, believed to be the place where the True Cross was found.\n\nStatus Quo\nOttoman decrees\nAn Ottoman decree of 1757 helped establish a status quo upholding the state of affairs for various Holy Land sites.\nThe status quo was upheld in Sultan Abdülmecid I's firman (decree) of 1852/53, which pinned down the now-permanent statutes of property and the regulations concerning the roles of the different denominations and other custodians.\nThe primary custodians are the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic churches. The Greek Orthodox act through the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate as well as through the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre. Roman Catholics act through the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land. In the 19th century, the Coptic Orthodox, the Ethiopian Orthodox and the Syriac Orthodox also acquired lesser responsibilities, which include shrines and other structures in and around the building.\nNone of these controls the main entrance. In 1192, Saladin assigned door-keeping responsibilities to the Muslim Nusaybah family. The wooden doors that compose the main entrance are the original, highly carved doors. The Joudeh al-Goudia (al-Ghodayya) family were entrusted as custodian to the keys of the Holy Sepulchre by Saladin in 1187. Despite occasional disagreements, religious services take place in the Church with regularity and coexistence is generally peaceful. An example of concord between the Church custodians is the full restoration of the Aedicule from 2016 to 2017.\n\nInterdenominational issues\nThe establishment of the modern Status Quo in 1853 did not halt controversy and occasional violence. \nIn 1902, 18 friars were hospitalized and some monks were jailed after the Franciscans and Greeks disagreed over who could clean the lowest step of the Chapel of the Franks. In the aftermath, the Greek patriarch, Franciscan custos, Ottoman governor and French consul general signed a convention that both denominations could sweep it.\nOn a hot summer day in 2002, a Coptic monk moved his chair from its agreed spot into the shade. This was interpreted as a hostile move by the Ethiopians and eleven were hospitalized after the resulting fight. In another incident in 2004, during Orthodox celebrations of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, a door to the Franciscan chapel was left open. This was taken as a sign of disrespect by the Orthodox and a fistfight broke out. Some people were arrested, but no one was seriously injured.\nOn Palm Sunday, in April 2008, a brawl broke out when a Greek monk was ejected from the building by a rival faction. Police were called to the scene but were also attacked by the enraged brawlers. On Sunday, 9 November 2008, a clash erupted between Armenian and Greek monks during celebrations for the Feast of the Cross.\n\nIssues with Israeli authorities\nTax and land disputes\nIn February 2018, the church was closed following a tax dispute over 152 million euros of uncollected taxes on church properties. The city hall stressed that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and all other churches are exempt from the taxes, with the changes only affecting establishments like \"hotels, halls and businesses\" owned by the churches.\nThere was a lock-in protest against an Israeli legislative proposal which would expropriate church lands that had been sold to private companies since 2010, a measure which church leaders assert constitutes a serious violation of their property rights and the Status Quo. In a joint official statement the church authorities protested what they considered to be the peak of a systematic campaign in:\n\na discriminatory and racist bill that targets solely the properties of the Christian community in the Holy Land ... This reminds us all of laws of a similar nature which were enacted against the Jews during dark periods in Europe.\nThe 2018 taxation affair does not cover any church buildings or religious related facilities (because they are exempt by law), but commercial facilities such as the Notre Dame Hotel which was not paying the municipal property tax, and any land which is owned and used as a commercial land. The church holds the rights to land where private homes have been constructed, and some of the disagreement had been raised after the Knesset had proposed a bill that will make it harder for a private company not to extend a lease for land used by homeowners. The church leaders have said that such a bill will make it harder for them to sell church-owned lands. According to The Jerusalem Post:\n\nThe stated aim of the bill is to protect homeowners against the possibility that private companies will not extend their leases of land on which their houses or apartments stand.\n\nLand sale to Israeli settlers\nIn 2017, NPR reported that the Greek Orthodox Church owns many properties across Jerusalem, Israel and the West Bank. It owns some 30% of the land in the Old City. But, due to property sales, these properties are diminishing every year. The decision to sell is made by Greek leaders, even though most local followers of the church are Arab Palestinians. The Palestinian Christians have raised concerns about selling these properties to Israeli settler-affiliated organizations.\nIn June 2019, a number of Christian denominations in Jerusalem raised their voice against the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the sale of three properties by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate to Ateret Cohanim – an organization that seeks to increase the number of Jews living in the Old City and East Jerusalem. The church leaders warned that if the organization gets to control the sites, Christians could lose access to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In June 2022, the Supreme Court upheld the sale and ended the legal battle.\n\nConnection to Roman temple\nThe site of the church had been a temple to Jupiter or Venus built by Hadrian before Constantine's edifice was built. Hadrian's temple had been located there because it was the junction of the main north–south road with one of the two main east–west roads and directly adjacent to the forum (now the location of the Muristan, which is smaller than the former forum). The forum itself had been placed, as is traditional in Roman towns, at the junction of the main north–south road with the other main east–west road (which is now El-Bazar/David Street). The temple and forum together took up the entire space between the two main east–west roads (a few above-ground remains of the east end of the temple precinct still survive in the Alexander Nevsky Church complex of the Russian Mission in Exile).\nFrom the archaeological excavations in the 1970s, it is clear that construction took over most of the site of the earlier temple enclosure and that the Triportico and Rotunda roughly overlapped with the temple building itself; the excavations indicate that the temple extended at least as far back as the Aedicule, and the temple enclosure would have reached back slightly further. Virgilio Canio Corbo, a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, who was present at the excavations, estimated from the archaeological evidence that the western retaining wall of the temple itself would have passed extremely close to the east side of the supposed tomb; if the wall had been any further west any tomb would have been crushed under the weight of the wall (which would be immediately above it) if it had not already been destroyed when foundations for the wall were made.\nOther archaeologists have criticized Corbo's reconstructions. Dan Bahat, the former city archaeologist of Jerusalem, regards them as unsatisfactory, as there is no known temple of Aphrodite (Venus) matching Corbo's design, and no archaeological evidence for Corbo's suggestion that the temple building was on a platform raised high enough to avoid including anything sited where the Aedicule is now; indeed Bahat notes that many temples to Aphrodite have a rotunda-like design, and argues that there is no archaeological reason to assume that the present rotunda was not based on a rotunda in the temple previously on the site.\n\nLocation\nThe New Testament describes Jesus's tomb as being outside the city wall, as was normal for burials across the ancient world, which were regarded as unclean. Today, the site of the Church is within the current walls of the old city of Jerusalem. It has been well documented by archaeologists that in the time of Jesus, the walled city was smaller and the wall then was to the east of the current site of the Church. In other words, the city had been much narrower in Jesus's time, with the site then having been outside the walls; since Herod Agrippa (41–44) is recorded by history as extending the city to the north (beyond the present northern walls), the required repositioning of the western wall is traditionally attributed to him as well.\nA recent archeological excavation conducted by Professor Francesca Romana Stasolla, found remains of olive trees and grapevines that are approximately 2,000 years old. These plant remnants, seeds and pollen, were discovered via archaeobotanical analysis performed on soil samples that had been extracted from beneath the stone floor of the church.\nThe area immediately to the south and east of the sepulchre was a quarry and outside the city during the early first century as excavations under the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer across the street demonstrated. \nThe church is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Old City of Jerusalem.\nThe Christian Quarter and the (also Christian) Armenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem are both located in the northwestern and western part of the Old City, due to the fact that the Holy Sepulchre is located close to the northwestern corner of the walled city. The adjacent neighbourhood within the Christian Quarter is called the Muristan, a term derived from the Persian word for hospital – Christian pilgrim hospices have been maintained in this area near the Holy Sepulchre since at least the time of Charlemagne.\n\nInfluence\nFrom the ninth century onward, the construction of churches inspired by the Anastasis was extended across Europe. One example is Santo Stefano in Bologna, Italy, an agglomeration of seven churches recreating shrines of Jerusalem.\nSeveral churches and monasteries in Europe, for instance, in Germany and Russia, and at least one church in the United States have been wholly or partially modelled on the Church of the Resurrection, some even reproducing other holy places for the benefit of pilgrims who could not travel to the Holy Land. They include the Heiliges Grab (\"Holy Tomb\") of Görlitz, constructed between 1481 and 1504, the New Jerusalem Monastery in Moscow Oblast, constructed by Patriarch Nikon between 1656 and 1666, and Mount St. Sepulchre Franciscan Monastery built by the Franciscans in Washington, DC in 1898.\nAuthor Andrew Holt writes that the church was the most important in all Christendom at the time of the Crusades.\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nJerusalem, Israel, Petra & Sinai.

          "summary": "The Church of the Holy Sepulchre,  also known as the Church of the Resurrection, is a fourth-century church in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. The church is simultaneously the seat of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, and the Catholic Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. It is the holiest site in Christianity and it has been an important pilgrimage site for Christians since the fourth century.\nAccording to traditions dating to the fourth century, the church contains both the site where Jesus was crucified at Calvary, or Golgotha, and the location of Jesus's empty tomb, where he was buried and, resurrected. Both locations are considered immensely holy sites by most Christians. The church and rotunda was built under Constantine the Great in the 4th century and destroyed by al-Hakim in 1009. Al-Hakim's son allowed Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos to reconstruct the church, which was completed in 1048. After it was captured by the crusaders in 1099, it continued to undergo modifications, resulting in a significant departure from the original structure. Several renovations and restorations were made under the Ottomans. The tomb itself is enclosed by a 19th-century shrine called the Aedicule.\nWithin the church proper are the last four stations of the Cross of the Via Dolorosa, representing the final episodes of the Passion of Jesus. The church has been a major Christian pilgrimage destination since its creation in the fourth century, as the traditional site of the resurrection of Christ, thus its original Greek name, Church of the Anastasis ('Resurrection').\nThe Status Quo, an understanding between religious communities dating to 1757, applies to the site. Control of the church itself is shared among several Christian denominations and secular entities in complicated arrangements essentially unchanged for over 160 years, and some for much longer. The main denominations sharing property over parts of the church are the Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, Coptic, Syriac, and Ethiopian Orthodox churches. Directly adjacent to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is the Church of the Redeemer, marking a Lutheran presence at the site.",

          "content": "The Western Wall (Hebrew: הַכּוֹתֶל הַמַּעֲרָבִי, romanized: HaKotel HaMa'aravi, lit. 'the western wall'; ; Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation: HaKosel HaMa'arovi) is an ancient retaining wall of the built-up hill known to Jews and Christians as the Temple Mount of Jerusalem. Its most famous section, known by the same name, often shortened by Jews to the Kotel or Kosel, is known in the West as the Wailing Wall, and in Arab world and Islamic world as the Buraq Wall (Arabic: حَائِط ٱلْبُرَاق, romanized: Ḥā'iṭ al-Burāq; ['ħaːʔɪtˤ albʊ'raːq]). In a Jewish religious context, the term Western Wall and its variations is used in the narrow sense, for the section used for Jewish prayer; in its broader sense it refers to the entire 488-metre-long (1,601 ft) retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount.\nAt the prayer section, just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates from the end of the Second Temple period, and is believed to have been begun by Herod the Great. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad period, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.\nThe Western Wall plays an important role in Judaism due to it being part of the man-made \"Temple Mount\", an artificially expanded hilltop best known as the traditional site of the Jewish Temple. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray outside the Temple Mount platform, because the presumed site of the Holy of Holies, the most sacred site in the Jewish faith, presumably lies just above and behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. The earliest source possibly mentioning this specific site as a place of Jewish worship is from the 10th century. The Western Wall, in the narrow sense, i.e. referring to the section used for Jewish prayer, is also known as the \"Wailing Wall\", in reference to the practice of Jews weeping at the site. During the period of  Christian Roman rule over Jerusalem (ca. 324–638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except on Tisha B'Av, the day of national mourning for the Temples. The term \"Wailing Wall\" has historically been used mainly by Christians, with use by Jews becoming marginal. Of the entire retaining wall, the section ritually used by Jews now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the Muslim Quarter, with the small exception of an 8-metre (26 ft) section, the so-called \"Little Western Wall\" or \"Small Wailing Wall\". This segment of the western retaining wall derives particular importance from having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much of the original Herodian stonework. In religious terms, the \"Little Western Wall\" is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the \"presence of God\" (Shechina), and the underground Warren's Gate, which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century.\nThe entire Western Wall constitutes the western border of al-Haram al-Sharif (\"the Noble Sanctuary\"), or the Al-Aqsa compound. It is believed to be the site where the Islamic Prophet Muhammad tied his winged steed, the Burāq, on his Night Journey, which tradition connects to Jerusalem, before ascending to heaven. While the wall was considered an integral part of the Haram esh-Sharif and waqf property of the Moroccan Quarter under Muslim rule, a right of Jewish prayer and pilgrimage has long existed as part of the Status Quo regulations. This position was confirmed in a 1930 international commission during the British Mandate period. \nWith the rise of the Zionist movement in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly riot in 1929 in which 133 Jews and 116 Arabs were killed, with many more people injured. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the Jewish Quarter, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall for 19 years. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the Six-Day War. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site, the Moroccan Quarter was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.\n\nEtymology\nWestern Wall\nEarly Jewish texts referred to a \"western wall of the Temple\", but there is doubt whether the texts were referring to the outer, retaining wall called today \"the Western Wall\", or to the western wall of the actual Temple. The earliest Jewish use of the Hebrew term \"ha-kotel ha-ma'aravi\", \"the Western Wall\", as referring to the wall visible today, was by the 11th-century poet Ahimaaz ben Paltiel.\n\nWailing Wall\nThe name \"Wailing Wall\", and descriptions such as \"wailing place\", appeared regularly in English literature during the 19th century. The name Mur des Lamentations was used in French and Klagemauer in German. This description stemmed from the Jewish practice of coming to the site to mourn and bemoan the destruction of the Temple and the loss of national freedom it symbolized.\n\nAl-Buraq Wall\nArab world and Islamic world have associated the name Al-Buraq with the wall at least since the 1860s.\n\nLocation, dimensions, stones\nPrayer section vs. entire wall\nThe term Western Wall commonly refers to a 187-foot (57 m) exposed section of a much longer retaining wall, built by Herod on the western flank of the Temple Mount. Only when used in this sense is it synonymous with the term Wailing Wall. This section faces a large plaza and is set aside for prayer.\nIn its entirety, the western retaining wall of the Herodian Temple Mount complex stretches for 1,600 feet (488 m), most of which is hidden behind medieval residential structures built along its length.\nThere are only two other revealed sections: the southern part of the Wall (see Robinson's Arch area), which measures approximately 80 metres (262 ft), and is separated from the prayer area by just a narrow stretch of archaeological remains; and another, much shorter section, known as the Little Western Wall, which is located close to the Iron Gate.\nThe entire western wall functions as a retaining wall, supporting and enclosing the ample substructures built by Herod the Great around 19 BCE. Herod's project was to create an artificial extension to the small quasi-natural plateau on which the First Temple stood, already widened in Hasmonean times during the Second Temple period, by finally transforming it into the almost rectangular, wide expanse of the Temple Mount platform visible today.\n\nHeight, courses, building stones\nAt the Western Wall Plaza, the total height of the Wall from its foundation is estimated at 105 feet (32 m), with the above-ground section standing approximately 62 feet (19 m) high. The Wall consists of 45 stone courses, 28 of them above ground and 17 underground. The first seven above-ground layers are from the Herodian period. This section of wall is built from enormous meleke limestone blocks, possibly quarried at either Zedekiah's Cave situated under the Muslim Quarter of the Old City, or at Ramat Shlomo 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) northwest of the Old City. Most of them weigh between 2 and 8 short tons (1.8 and 7.3 tonnes) each, but others weigh even more, with one extraordinary stone located slightly north of Wilson's Arch measuring 13.55 metres (44.5 ft) long, 3.3 metres (11 ft) high, approximately 1.8 to 2.5 metres (5.9 to 8.2 ft) deep, and weighing between 250 and 300 tonnes (280 and 330 short tons). Each of these ashlars is framed by fine-chiseled borders. The margins themselves measure between 5 and 20 centimetres (2 and 8 in) wide, with their depth measuring 1.5 centimetres (0.59 in). In the Herodian period, the upper 10 metres (33 ft) of wall were 1 metre (39 in) thick and served as the outer wall of the double colonnade of the Temple platform. This upper section was decorated with pilasters, the remainder of which were destroyed when the Byzantines reconquered Jerusalem from the Persians in 628.\nThe next four courses, consisting of smaller plainly dressed stones, are Umayyad work (8th century, Early Muslim period). Above that are 16 to 17 courses of small stones from the Mamluk period (13th–16th centuries) and later.\n\nHistory\nConstruction and destruction (19 BCE – 70 CE)\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, Solomon's Temple was built atop what is known as the Temple Mount in the 10th century BCE and destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, and the Second Temple completed and dedicated in 516 BCE. Around 19 BCE Herod the Great began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount. In addition to fully rebuilding and enlarging the Temple, he artificially expanded the platform on which it stood, doubling it in size. Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death, found under the foundation stones of the wall. The excavators came upon the coins inside a ritual bath that predates Herod's building project, which was filled in to create an even base for the wall and was located under its southern section. This seems to indicate that Herod did not finish building the entire wall by the time of his death in 4 BCE. The find confirms the description by historian Josephus Flavius, which states that construction was finished only during the reign of King Agrippa II, Herod's great-grandson. Given Josephus' information, the surprise mainly regarded the fact that an unfinished retaining wall in this area could also mean that at least parts of the splendid Royal Stoa and the monumental staircase leading up to it could not have been completed during Herod's lifetime. Also surprising was the fact that the usually very thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath, rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock. Some scholars are doubtful of the interpretation and have offered alternative explanations, such as, for example, later repair work.\nHerod's Temple was destroyed by the Romans, along with the rest of Jerusalem, in 70 CE, during the First Jewish–Roman War.\n\nLate Roman and Byzantine periods (135–638)\nDuring much of the 2nd–5th centuries of the Common Era, after the Roman defeat of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, Jews were banned from Jerusalem. There is some evidence that Roman emperors in the 2nd and 3rd centuries did permit them to visit the city to worship on the Mount of Olives and sometimes on the Temple Mount itself. When the empire started becoming Christian under Constantine I, they were given permission to enter the city once a year, on the Tisha B'Av, to lament the loss of the Temple at the wall. The Bordeaux Pilgrim, who wrote in 333 CE, suggests that it was probably to the perforated stone or the Rock of Moriah, \"to which the Jews come every year and anoint it, bewail themselves with groans, rend their garments, and so depart\". This was because an imperial decree from Rome barred Jews from living in Jerusalem. Just once per year they were permitted to return and bitterly grieve about the fate of their people. Comparable accounts survive, including those by the Church Father, Gregory of Nazianzus (c. 329–390) and by Jerome in his commentary to Zephaniah written in 392 CE. In the 4th century, Christian sources reveal that the Jews encountered great difficulty in buying the right to pray near the Western Wall, at least on the 9th of Av. In 425 CE, the Jews of the Galilee wrote to Byzantine empress Aelia Eudocia seeking permission to pray by the ruins of the Temple. Permission was granted and they were officially permitted to resettle in Jerusalem.\n\nArchaeology\nDiscovery of underground rooms that could have been used as food storage carved out of the bedrock under the 1,400-year-old mosaic floor of Byzantine structure was announced by Israel Antiquities Authority in May in 2020.\n\"At first we were very disappointed because we found we hit the bedrock, meaning that the material culture, the human activity here in Jerusalem ended. What we found here was a rock-cut system—three rooms, all hewn in the bedrock of ancient Jerusalem\" said co-director of the excavation Barak Monnickendam-Givon.\n\nEarly Muslim to Mamluk period (638–1517)\nSeveral Jewish authors of the 10th and 11th centuries write about the Jews resorting to the Western Wall for devotional purposes. Ahimaaz relates that Samuel ben Paltiel (980–1010) gave money for oil at \"the sanctuary at the Western Wall.\" Benjamin of Tudela (1170) wrote \"In front of this place is the western wall, which is one of the walls of the Holy of Holies. This is called the Gate of Mercy, and hither come all the Jews to pray before the Wall in the open court.\" The account gave rise to confusion about the actual location of Jewish worship, and some suggest that Benjamin in fact referred to the Eastern Wall along with its Gate of Mercy. While Nahmanides (d. 1270) did not mention a synagogue near the Western Wall in his detailed account of the temple site, shortly before the Crusader period a synagogue existed at the site. Obadiah of Bertinoro (1488) states \"the Western Wall, part of which is still standing, is made of great, thick stones, larger than any I have seen in buildings of antiquity in Rome or in other lands.\"\nShortly after Saladin's 1187 siege of the city, in 1193, the sultan's son and successor al-Afdal established the land adjacent to the wall as a charitable trust (waqf). The largest part of it was named after an important mystic, Abu Madyan Shu'aib. The Abu Madyan waqf was dedicated to Maghrebian pilgrims and scholars who had taken up residence there, and houses were built only metres away from the wall, from which they were thus separated by just a narrow passageway, some 4 metres (13 ft) wide.\nThe first likely mention of the Islamic tradition that Buraq was tethered at the site is from the 14th century. A manuscript by Ibrahim b. Ishaq al-Ansari (known as Ibn Furkah, d. 1328) refers to Bab al-Nabi (lit. 'Gate of the Prophet'), an old name for Barclay's Gate below the Maghrebi Gate. Charles D. Matthews however, who edited al-Firkah's work, notes that other statements of al-Firkah might seem to point to the Double Gate in the southern wall.\n\nOttoman period (1517–1917)\nIn 1517, the Turkish Ottomans under Selim I conquered Jerusalem from the Mamluks who had held it since 1250. Selim's son, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, ordered the construction of an imposing wall to be built around the entire city, which still stands today. Various folktales relate Suleiman's quest to locate the Temple site and his order to have the area \"swept and sprinkled, and the Western Wall washed with rosewater\" upon its discovery. According to a legend cited by Moses Hagiz, Jews received official permission to worship at the site and Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan built an oratory for them there, but, as of Purim 1625, Jews were banned from praying on the Temple Mount and only sometimes dared to pray at the Western Wall, for which purpose a special liturgy had been arranged. Gedaliah of Siemiatycze, who lived in Jerusalem from 1700 to 1706, reports that Jews then had access to the wall and would pray there as often as possible.\nOver the centuries, land close to the Wall became built up. Public access to the Wall was through the Moroccan Quarter, a labyrinth of narrow alleyways. In May 1840 a firman issued by Ibrahim Pasha forbade the Jews to pave the passageway in front of the Wall. It also cautioned them against \"raising their voices and displaying their books there.\" They were, however, allowed \"to pay visits to it as of old.\"\nRabbi Joseph Schwarz writing in the mid-19th century records:\n\nThis wall is visited by all our brothers on every feast and festival; and the large space at its foot is often so densely filled up, that all cannot perform their devotions here at the same time. It is also visited, though by less numbers, on every Friday afternoon, and by some nearly every day. No one is molested in these visits by the Mahomedans, as we have a very old firman from the Sultan of Constantinople that the approach shall not be denied to us, though the Porte obtains for this privilege a special tax, which is, however, quite insignificant.\nOver time the increased numbers of people gathering at the site resulted in tensions between the Jewish visitors who wanted easier access and more space, and the residents, who complained of the noise. This gave rise to Jewish attempts at gaining ownership of the land adjacent to the Wall.\n\nIn the late 1830s a wealthy Jew named Shemarya Luria attempted to purchase houses near the Wall, but was unsuccessful, as was Jewish sage Abdullah of Bombay who tried to purchase the Western Wall in the 1850s. In 1869 Rabbi Hillel Moshe Gelbstein settled in Jerusalem. He arranged that benches and tables be brought to the Wall on a daily basis for the study groups he organised and the minyan which he led there for years. He also formulated a plan whereby some of the courtyards facing the Wall would be acquired, with the intention of establishing three synagogues—one each for the Sephardim, the Hasidim and the Perushim. He also endeavoured to re-establish an ancient practice of \"guards of honour\", which according to the mishnah in Middot, were positioned around the Temple Mount. He rented a house near the Wall and paid men to stand guard there and at various other gateways around the mount. However, this set-up lasted only for a short time due to lack of funds or because of Arab resentment. In 1874, Mordechai Rosanes paid for the repaving of the alleyway adjacent to the wall.\nIn 1887 Baron Rothschild conceived a plan to purchase and demolish the Moroccan Quarter as \"a merit and honor to the Jewish People.\" The proposed purchase was considered and approved by the Ottoman Governor of Jerusalem, Rauf Pasha, and by the Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammed Tahir Husseini. Even after permission was obtained from the highest secular and Muslim religious authority to proceed, the transaction was shelved after the authorities insisted that after demolishing the quarter no construction of any type could take place there, only trees could be planted to beautify the area. Additionally the Jews would not have full control over the area. This meant that they would have no power to stop people from using the plaza for various activities, including the driving of mules, which would cause a disturbance to worshippers. Other reports place the scheme's failure on Jewish infighting as to whether the plan would foster a detrimental Arab reaction.\n\nIn 1895 Hebrew linguist and publisher Rabbi Chaim Hirschensohn became entangled in a failed effort to purchase the Western Wall and lost all his assets. The attempts of the Palestine Land Development Company to purchase the environs of the Western Wall for the Jews just before the outbreak of World War I also never came to fruition. In the first two months following the Ottoman Empire's entry into the First World War, the Turkish governor of Jerusalem, Zakey Bey, offered to sell the Moroccan Quarter, which consisted of about 25 houses, to the Jews in order to enlarge the area available to them for prayer. He requested a sum of £20,000 which would be used to both rehouse the Muslim families and to create a public garden in front of the Wall. However, the Jews of the city lacked the necessary funds. A few months later, under Muslim Arab pressure on the Turkish authorities in Jerusalem, Jews became forbidden by official decree to place benches and light candles at the Wall. This sour turn in relations was taken up by the Chacham Bashi who managed to get the ban overturned. In 1915 it was reported that Djemal Pasha, closed off the wall to visitation as a sanitary measure. Probably meant was the \"Great\", rather than the \"Small\" Djemal Pasha.\n\nDecrees (firman)s issued regarding the Wall:\n\nThese firmans were cited by the Jewish contingent at the International Commission, 1930, as proof for rights at the Wall. Muslim authorities responded by arguing that historic sanctions of Jewish presence were acts of tolerance shown by Muslims, who, by doing so, did not concede any positive rights.\n\nBritish rule (1917–1948)\nIn December 1917, Allied forces under Edmund Allenby captured Jerusalem from the Turks. Allenby pledged \"that every sacred building, monument, holy spot, shrine, traditional site, endowment, pious bequest, or customary place of prayer of whatsoever form of the three religions will be maintained and protected according to the existing customs and beliefs of those to whose faith they are sacred\".\nIn 1919 Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann approached the British Military Governor of Jerusalem, Colonel Sir Ronald Storrs, and offered between £75,000 and £100,000 (approx. £5m in modern terms) to purchase the area at the foot of the Wall and rehouse the occupants. Storrs was enthusiastic about the idea because he hoped some of the money would be used to improve Muslim education. Although they appeared promising at first, negotiations broke down after strong Muslim opposition. Storrs wrote two decades later:\n\nThe acceptance of the proposals, had it been practicable, would have obviated years of wretched humiliations, including the befouling of the Wall and pavement and the unmannerly braying of the tragi-comic Arab band during Jewish prayer, and culminating in the horrible outrages of 1929.\nIn early 1920, the first Jewish-Arab dispute over the Wall occurred when the Muslim authorities were carrying out minor repair works to the Wall's upper courses. The Jews, while agreeing that the works were necessary, appealed to the British that they be made under supervision of the newly formed Department of Antiquities, because the Wall was an ancient relic.\nAccording to Hillel Halkin, in the 1920s, among rising tensions with the Jews regarding the wall, the Arabs ceased using the more traditional name El-Mabka, \"the Place of Weeping\", which related to Jewish practices, and replaced it with El-Burak, a name with Muslim connotations.\nIn 1926 an effort was made to lease the Maghrebi waqf, which included the wall, with the plan of eventually buying it. Negotiations were begun in secret by the Jewish judge Gad Frumkin, with financial backing from American millionaire Nathan Straus. The chairman of the Palestine Zionist Executive, Colonel F. H. Kisch, explained that the aim was \"quietly to evacuate the Moroccan occupants of those houses which it would later be necessary to demolish\" to create an open space with seats for aged worshippers to sit on. However, Straus withdrew when the price became excessive and the plan came to nothing. The Va'ad Leumi, against the advice of the Palestine Zionist Executive, demanded that the British expropriate the wall and give it to the Jews, but the British refused.\nIn 1928 the World Zionist Organization reported that John Chancellor, High Commissioner of Palestine, believed that the Western Wall should come under Jewish control and wondered \"why no great Jewish philanthropist had not bought it yet\".\n\nSeptember 1928 disturbances\nIn 1922, a Status Quo agreement issued by the mandatory authority forbade the placing of benches or chairs near the Wall. The last occurrence of such a ban was in 1915, but the Ottoman decree was soon retracted after intervention of the Chacham Bashi. In 1928 the District Commissioner of Jerusalem, Edward Keith-Roach, acceded to an Arab request to implement the ban. This led to a British officer being stationed at the Wall making sure that Jews were prevented from sitting. Nor were Jews permitted to separate the sexes with a screen. In practice, a flexible modus vivendi had emerged and such screens had been put up from time to time when large numbers of people gathered to pray.\n\nOn September 24, 1928, the Day of Atonement, British police resorted to removing by force a screen used to separate men and women at prayer. Women who tried to prevent the screen being dismantled were beaten by the police, who used pieces of the broken wooden frame as clubs. Chairs were then pulled out from under elderly worshipers. The episode made international news and Jews the world over objected to the British action. Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, the Chief Rabbi of the Haredi Jews in Jerusalem, issued a protest letter on behalf of his community, the Edah HaChareidis and Agudas Yisroel, strongly condemning the desecration of the holy site. Various communal leaders called for a general strike. A large rally was held in the Etz Chaim Yeshiva, following which an angry crowd attacked the local police station in which they believed Douglas Valder Duff, the British officer involved, was sheltering.\nCommissioner Edward Keith-Roach described the screen as violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western Wall area. He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Masjid Al-Aqsa. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle at the Wall. It stressed that the removal of the screen was necessary, but expressed regret over the ensuing events.\nA widespread Arab campaign to protest against presumed Jewish intentions and designs to take possession of the Al Aqsa Mosque swept the country and a \"Society for the Protection of the Muslim Holy Places\" was established. The Jewish National Council (Vaad Leumi) responding to these Arab fears declared in a statement that \"We herewith declare emphatically and sincerely that no Jew has ever thought of encroaching upon the rights of Moslems over their own Holy places, but our Arab brethren should also recognise the rights of Jews in regard to the places in Palestine which are holy to them.\" The committee also demanded that the British administration expropriate the wall for the Jews.\nFrom October 1928 onward, Mufti Amin al-Husayni organised a series of measures to demonstrate the Arabs' exclusive claims to the Temple Mount and its environs. He ordered new construction next to and above the Western Wall. The British granted the Arabs permission to convert a building adjoining the Wall into a mosque and to add a minaret. A muezzin was appointed to perform the Islamic call to prayer and Sufi rites directly next to the Wall. These were seen as a provocation by the Jews who prayed at the Wall. The Jews protested and tensions increased.\n\nA British inquiry into the disturbances and investigation regarding the principal issue in the Western Wall dispute, namely the rights of the Jewish worshipers to bring appurtenances to the wall, was convened. The Supreme Muslim Council provided documents dating from the Turkish regime supporting their claims. However, repeated reminders to the Chief Rabbinate to verify which apparatus had been permitted failed to elicit any response. They refused to do so, arguing that Jews had the right to pray at the Wall without restrictions. Subsequently, in November 1928, the Government issued a White Paper entitled \"The Western or Wailing Wall in Jerusalem: Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies\", which emphasised the maintenance of the status quo and instructed that Jews could only bring \"those accessories which had been permitted in Turkish times.\"\nA few months later, Haj Amin complained to Chancellor that \"Jews were bringing benches and tables in increased numbers to the wall and driving nails into the wall and hanging lamps on them.\"\n\n1929 Palestine riots\nIn the summer of 1929, the Mufti Haj Amin Al Husseinni ordered an opening be made at the southern end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall. The former cul-de-sac became a thoroughfare which led from the Temple Mount into the prayer area at the Wall. Mules were herded through the narrow alley, often dropping excrement. This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, and restricted access to the Wall, resulted in Jewish protests to the British, who remained indifferent.\nOn August 14, 1929, after attacks on individual Jews praying at the Wall, 6,000 Jews demonstrated in Tel Aviv, shouting \"The Wall is ours.\" The next day, the Jewish fast of Tisha B'Av, 300 youths raised the Zionist flag and sang Hatikva at the Wall. The day after, on August 16, an organized mob of 2,000 Muslim Arabs descended on the Western Wall, injuring the beadle and burning prayer books, liturgical fixtures and notes of supplication. The rioting spread to the Jewish commercial area of town, and was followed a few days later by the Hebron massacre. One hundred and thirty-three Jews were killed and 339 injured in the Arab riots, and in the subsequent process of quelling the riots 110 Arabs were killed by British police. This was by far the deadliest attack on Jews during the period of British Rule over Palestine.\n\n1930 international commission\nIn 1930, in response to the 1929 riots, the British Government appointed a commission \"to determine the rights and claims of Muslims and Jews in connection with the Western or Wailing Wall\", and to determine the causes of the violence and prevent it in the future. The League of Nations approved the commission on condition that the members were not British.\nThe Commission noted that \"the Jews do not claim any proprietorship to the Wall or to the Pavement in front of it (concluding speech of Jewish Counsel, Minutes, page 908).\"\n\nThe Commission concluded that the wall, and the adjacent pavement and Moroccan Quarter, were solely owned by the Muslim waqf. However, Jews had the right to \"free access to the Western Wall for the purpose of devotions at all times\", subject to some stipulations that limited which objects could be brought to the Wall and forbade the blowing of the shofar, which was made illegal. Muslims were forbidden to disrupt Jewish devotions by driving animals or other means.\nThe recommendations of the Commission were brought into law by the Palestine (Western or Wailing Wall) Order in Council, 1931, which came into effect on June 8, 1931. Persons violating the law were liable to a fine of 50 pounds or imprisonment up to 6 months, or both.\nDuring the 1930s, at the conclusion of Yom Kippur, young Jews persistently flouted the shofar ban each year and blew the shofar resulting in their arrest and prosecution. They were usually fined or sentenced to imprisonment for three to six months. The Shaw commission determined that the violence occurred due to \"racial animosity on the part of the Arabs, consequent upon the disappointment of their political and national aspirations and fear for their economic future.\"\n\nJordanian rule (1948–1967)\nDuring the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the Old City together with the Wall was controlled by Jordan. Article VIII of the 1949 Armistice Agreement called for a Special Committee to make arrangements for (amongst other things) \"free access to the Holy Places and cultural institutions and use of the cemetery on the Mount of Olives\". The committee sat multiple times during 1949, but both sides made additional demands and at the same time the Palestine Conciliation Commission was pressing for the internationalization of Jerusalem against the wishes of both parties. No agreement was ever reached, leading to recriminations in both directions. Neither Israeli Arabs nor Israeli Jews could visit their holy places in the Jordanian territories. An exception was made for Christians to participate in Christmas ceremonies in Bethlehem. Some sources claim Jews could only visit the wall if they traveled through Jordan (which was not an option for Israelis) and did not have an Israeli visa stamped in their passports. Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location to the Wall under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.\n\n\"Al Buraq (Wailing Wall) Rd\" sign\nDuring the Jordanian rule of the Old City, a ceramic street sign in Arabic and English was affixed to the stones of the ancient wall. Attached 2.1 metres (6.9 ft) up, it was made up of eight separate ceramic tiles and said Al Buraq Road in Arabic at the top with the English \"Al-Buraq (Wailing Wall) Rd\" below. When Israeli soldiers arrived at the wall in June 1967, one attempted to scrawl Hebrew lettering on it. The Jerusalem Post reported that on June 8, Ben-Gurion went to the wall and \"looked with distaste\" at the road sign; \"this is not right, it should come down\" and he proceeded to dismantle it. This act signaled the climax of the capture of the Old City and the ability of Jews to once again access their holiest sites. Emotional recollections of this event are related by David Ben-Gurion and Shimon Peres.\n\nFirst years under Israeli rule (1967–1969)\nDeclarations after the conquest\nFollowing Israel's victory during the 1967 Six-Day War, the Western Wall came under Israeli control. Brigadier Rabbi Shlomo Goren proclaimed after its capture that \"Israel would never again relinquish the Wall\", a stance supported by Israeli Minister for Defence Moshe Dayan and Chief of Staff General Yitzhak Rabin. Rabin described the moment Israeli soldiers reached the Wall:\n\n\"There was one moment in the Six-Day War which symbolized the great victory: that was the moment in which the first paratroopers—under Gur's command—reached the stones of the Western Wall, feeling the emotion of the place; there never was, and never will be, another moment like it. Nobody staged that moment. Nobody planned it in advance. Nobody prepared it and nobody was prepared for it; it was as if Providence had directed the whole thing: the paratroopers weeping—loudly and in pain—over their comrades who had fallen along the way, the words of the Kaddish prayer heard by Western Wall's stones after 19 years of silence, tears of mourning, shouts of joy, and the singing of 'Hatikvah'\".\n\nDemolition of the Moroccan Quarter\nForty-eight hours after capturing the wall, the military, without explicit government order, hastily proceeded to demolish the entire Moroccan Quarter, which stood 4 metres (13 ft) from the Wall. The Sheikh Eid Mosque, built on the site of one of Jerusalem's earliest Islamic schools (the Afdiliyyah), was pulled down to make way for the plaza. 106 Arab families consisting of 650 people were ordered to leave their homes at night. When they refused, bulldozers began to demolish the buildings with people still inside, killing one person and injuring a number of others.\nAccording to Eyal Weizman, Chaim Herzog, who later became Israel's sixth president, took much of the credit for the destruction of the neighbourhood:\n\nWhen we visited the Wailing Wall we found a toilet attached to it ... we decided to remove it and from this we came to the conclusion that we could evacuate the entire area in front of the Wailing Wall ... a historical opportunity that will never return. ... We knew that the following Saturday [sic Wednesday], June 14, would be the Jewish festival of Shavuot and that many will want to come to pray ... it all had to be completed by then.\nThe narrow pavement, which could accommodate a maximum of 12,000 per day, was transformed into an enormous plaza that could hold in excess of 400,000. Several months later, the pavement close to the wall was excavated to a depth of two and half metres, exposing an additional two courses of large stones.\nA complex of buildings against the wall at the southern end of the plaza, that included Madrasa Fakhriya and the house that the Abu al-Sa'ud family had occupied since the 16th century, were spared in the 1967 destruction, but demolished in 1969. The section of the wall dedicated to prayers was thus extended southwards to double its original length, from 28 to 60 metres (92 to 197 ft), while the 4 metres (13 ft) space facing the wall grew to 40 metres (130 ft).\nThe narrow, approximately 120 square metres (1,300 sq ft) pre-1948 alley along the wall, used for Jewish prayer, was enlarged to 2,400 square metres (26,000 sq ft), with the entire Western Wall Plaza covering 20,000 square metres (4.9 acres), stretching from the wall to the Jewish Quarter.\n\nPlaza\nThe new plaza created in 1967 is used for worship and public gatherings, including Bar mitzvah celebrations and the swearing-in ceremonies of newly full-fledged soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces. Tens of thousands of Jews flock to the wall on the Jewish holidays, and particularly on the fast of Tisha B'Av, which marks the destruction of the Temple and on Jerusalem Day, which commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 and the delivery of the Wall into Jewish hands.\nIn November 2010, the government approved a NIS 85 million ($23 million) plan to improve access from the Jewish Quarter and upgrade infrastructure at the Wall.\n\nOrthodox rules\nConflicts over prayer at the national monument began a little more than a year after Israel's victory in the Six-Day War, which again made the site accessible to Jews. In July 1968 the World Union for Progressive Judaism, which had planned the group's international convention in Jerusalem, appealed to the Knesset after the Ministry of Religious Affairs prohibited the organization from hosting mixed-gender services at the Wall. The Knesset committee on internal affairs backed the Ministry of Religious Affairs in disallowing the Jewish convention attendees, who had come from over 24 countries, from worshiping in their fashion. The Orthodox held that services at the Wall should follow traditional Jewish law for segregated seating followed in synagogues, while the non-Orthodox perspective was that \"the Wall is a shrine of all Jews, not one particular branch of Judaism.\"\n\nWilson's Arch area\nArchaeology\nTransformation into worship area\nIn September 1983, U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain, Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff was allowed to hold an unusual interfaith service—the first interfaith service ever conducted at the Wall during the time it was under Israeli control—that included men and women sitting together. The ten-minute service included the Priestly Blessing, recited by Resnicoff, who is a Kohen. A Ministry of Religions representative was present, responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.\nIn 2005, the Western Wall Heritage Foundation initiated a major renovation effort under Rabbi-of-the-Wall Shmuel Rabinovitch. Its goal was to renovate and restructure the area within Wilson's Arch, the covered area to the left of worshipers facing the Wall in the open prayer plaza, in order to increase access for visitors and for prayer.\nThe restoration of the men's section included a Torah ark that can house over 100 Torah scrolls, in addition to new bookshelves, a library, heating for the winter, and air conditioning for the summer. A new room was also built for the scribes who maintain and preserve the Torah scrolls used at the Wall. New construction also included a women's section, overlooking the men's prayer area, so that women could use this separate area to \"take part in the services held inside under the Arch\" for the first time.\nOn July 25, 2010, a ner tamid, an oil-burning \"eternal light,\" was installed within the prayer hall within Wilson's Arch, the first eternal light installed in the area of the Western Wall. According to the Western Wall Heritage Foundation, requests had been made for many years that \"an olive oil lamp be placed in the prayer hall of the Western Wall Plaza, as is the custom in Jewish synagogues, to represent the menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem as well as the continuously burning fire on the altar of burnt offerings in front of the Temple,\" especially in the closest place to those ancient flames.\n\nA number of special worship events have been held since the renovation. They have taken advantage of the cover, temperature control, and enhanced security.\n\nRobinson's Arch area\nArchaeology\nAt the southern end of the Western Wall, Robinson's Arch along with a row of vaults once supported stairs ascending from the street to the Temple Mount.\nThe so-called Isaiah Stone, located under Robinson's Arch, has a carved inscription in Hebrew with a partial and slightly faulty quote from (or paraphrase of) Isaiah 66:14: \"And you will see and your heart will rejoice and their bones like an herb [will flourish]\" (the correct line from Isaiah would read \"... your bones\".) This gave room to various interpretations, some speculating about it being written during a period of hope for Jews. Alternatively, it might be connected to nearby graves. The inscription has tentatively been dated to the 4th–8th century, some extending the possible timespan all the way to the 11th century.\n\nNon-Orthodox worship area\nBecause it does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the site has been opened to religious groups that hold worship services that would not be approved by the Rabbi of the Western Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs in the major men's and women's prayer areas against the Wall. The worship site was inaugurated in 2004 and has since hosted services by Reform and Conservative groups, as well as services by the Women of the Wall. A platform has been added in 2013 in order to expand the prayer area.\n\nIn Judaism\nHistory as place of prayer\nJews were banned from Jerusalem by the Roman authorities after the Second Jewish revolt (2nd century CE) and, although there are intermittent accounts of limited 9th of Av services on the Temple Mount, no sources from before the 7th-century Islamic conquest attest to any other Jewish services allowed near the Mount and many report that none were permitted. Sources conflict with regard to the Mount's status under Islamic rule, but Karaite commentator Salmon ben Jeroham (c. 950 CE) reports that Jews were initially granted wide access to the Mount, then restricted to gathering near \"one of its gates\", then banned entirely before his own time.\n\n10th–12th centuries\nHowever, a synagogue was apparently founded by the Western Wall (in the broader sense) shortly after the time of Salmon. The Scroll of Ahimaaz, a historical chronicle written in 1050 CE, describes:Samuel his son arose to replace [Paltiel], and this great man filled his father's place [in c. 980 CE] ... [He] dedicated 20,000 golden  drachmas to the One Who Dwells on High, to entreat the favor of the Rider of Clouds. These were alms for the poor...; oil for the synagogue in the western wall, for [the lamps on] its bema ...This account of Jewish prayer at the edge of the Mount in confirmed by Daniel ben Azariah, who writes (c. 1055 CE) that Jews were then permitted to \"pray near the Mount's gates\".\nIn 1099 CE the Crusader army  captured Jerusalem, killing almost every Jew inside, and banned Jewish pilgrims from approaching the Mount. In his Scroll of Revelation (c. 1125 CE), Abraham bar Hiyya records that:... the Romans who destroyed the Temple in the days of the evil Titus, though they despoiled its sanctuary, never claimed any ownership of the holy Mount or any need to pray there. But ever since the evil  Constantine converted to Christianity, they have begun to make these claims ... Since [1099 CE] the Christians have desecrated the Mount, made the citadel their church, brought their idols within it, and prevented Jews from praying there. Ever since those villains took over the Mount, no Jew has been allowed to enter it, and none are to be found in all Jerusalem.\n\nIn another reversal by c. 1167 CE, during the later Crusader period, the Western Wall was reopened to Jewish prayer. Benjamin of Tudela attests:. . . and the Gate of Jehoshaphat, which faced the Temple in ancient times. There is the Templi Domini, which is the site of the Temple, and on it is a large and very beautiful dome built by Umar bin al-Khataab. Although they come to pray, the gentiles do not bring any images or effigies onto the site. And in front of this place is the western wall, which was one of the walls in the Holy of Holies; this is called the Gate of Mercy and hither come all the Jews to pray before the wall in the courtyard.\n\n17th century\nIn 1625, David Finzi reported to the Jewish leadership of Carpi that:. . . from there we went up to the Temple Mount, passing mundane structures until we reached the peak of the Mount, where once the Temple stood, which was destroyed for our sins. Now a mosque is built upon it, and Jews are prohibited from entering it; only outside it, near the Western Wall, are Jews allowed to gather, and even this only in peaceful times—in difficult times, such as these, the Jewish community has decreed that no one go there.\nBut in the first week of our visit, before this decree, we went all the way in, and kissed it, and I prostrated myself before its base, and there I said the ordered prayers, and also entreated God to bless all the Jews of Carpi ... Though it is called the Western Wall, nothing of the Temple whatever survived the destruction, the looting by thieves, and the construction of the mosque. They built a citadel on the site of the Foundation Stone, surpassingly lovely ...Tensions eventually calmed again. Gedaliah of Siemiatycze, who lived in Jerusalem from 1700 to 1706, records that:Only Muslims are permitted to enter the Mount and not Jews or other peoples, unless they convert to the Muslim faith. They say that not just any faith is worthy of the Mount, and they continually remind us that the Muslims have superseded the Jews in the eyes of God. When we go to pray at the Wall, we press right up against it, like the lover in Song of Songs who \"standeth behind our wall\". On the eve of the New Moon, on Tisha ba'Av, and on other fast days, we go there to pray, and the women to raise their plangent cries, but no one challenges us, and even the qadi who lives there does not object. Though the Arab youths sometimes come to prey on us, they are easily bribed to leave us alone, and if caught by their own elders they are rebuked ... Prayer by the Wall usually meets with God's favor ... . Once in olden times, or so I heard, there was a terrible drought. The Jews declared a day of fasting, and they went with a Torah scroll to the Western Wall to pray, and God answered their prayers so readily that they had to wrap the scroll in their clothes on their return to the synagogue. Every Sabbath morning, after the services at the synagogue, we immediately set off for the Western Wall ... every single one of us, Ashkenazic and Sephardic, old and young ... there we recite those Psalms that mention Jerusalem, and Pitom haQtores, and Aleinu l'Shabeach, and the Kaddish, and we bless those in the diaspora who fundraise for Eretz Yisrael ... .\n\n18th–19th centuries\nThe writings of various travellers in the Holy Land, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries, tell of how the Wall and its environs continued to be a place of devotion for the Jews. Isaac Yahuda, a prominent member of the Sephardic community in Jerusalem recalled how men and women used to gather in a circle at the Wall to hear sermons delivered in Ladino. His great-grandmother, who arrived in Palestine in 1841, \"used to go to the Western Wall every Friday afternoon, winter and summer, and stay there until candle-lighting time, reading the entire Book of Psalms and the Song of Songs...she would sit there by herself for hours.\"\n\n20th–21st centuries\nIn the past women could be found sitting at the entrance to the Wall every Sabbath holding fragrant herbs and spices in order to enable worshipers to make additional blessings. In the hot weather they would provide cool water. The women also used to cast lots for the privilege of sweeping and washing the alleyway at the foot of the Wall.\nThroughout several centuries, the Wall is where Jews have gathered to express gratitude to God or to pray for divine mercy. On news of the Normandy landings on June 6, 1944 thousands of Jews went to the Wall to offer prayers for the \"success of His Majesty's and Allied Forces in the liberation of all enemy-occupied territory.\" On October 13, 1994, 50,000 gathered to pray for the safe return of kidnapped soldier Nachshon Wachsman. August 10, 2005 saw a massive prayer rally at the Wall. Estimates of people protesting Israel's unilateral disengagement plan ranged from 50,000 to 250,000 people. Every year on Tisha B'Av large crowds congregate at the Wall to commemorate the destruction of the Temple. In 2007 over 100,000 gathered. During the month of Tishrei 2009, a record 1.5 million people visited the site.\n\nRelation to the Foundation Stone\nIn Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as the sole remnant of the Holy Temple. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, as it is the closest permitted accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the Even ha-shetiya or Foundation Stone, which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by Kareth. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the Dome of the Rock is the Foundation Stone, some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain. This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.\n\nPart of the Temple proper\nRabbinic tradition teaches that the western wall was built upon foundations laid by the biblical King Solomon from the time of the First Temple.\nSome medieval rabbis claimed that today's Western Wall is a surviving wall of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts in a state of impurity. Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness.\n\nDivine custody\nA 7th-century Midrash refers to a western wall of the Temple which \"would never be destroyed\", and a 6th-century Midrash mentions how Rome was unable to topple the western wall due to the Divine oath promising its eternal survival.\n\nDivine Presence\nAn 11th-century Midrash quotes a 4th-century scholar: \"Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never departed from the Western Wall\", and the Zohar (13th century) similarly writes that \"the Divine Presence rests upon the Western Wall\".\nEighteenth-century scholar Jonathan Eybeschutz writes that \"after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour\". It is told that great Jewish sages, including Isaac Luria and the Radvaz, experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.\n\nKabbalah of the word kotel\nRabbi Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word kotel when discussing the significance of praying against a wall. He cites the Zohar which writes that the word kotel, meaning wall, is made up of two parts: \"Ko\", which has the numerical value of God's name, and \"Tel\", meaning mount, which refers to the Temple and its Western Wall.\n\nRitual\nStatus as a synagogue\nMany contemporary Orthodox scholars rule that the area in front of the Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect. This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall to show its sanctity. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.\n\nContact with the Wall\nSome Orthodox Jewish codifiers warn against inserting fingers into the cracks of the Wall as they believe that the breadth of the Wall constitutes part of the Temple Mount itself and retains holiness, while others who permit doing so claim that the Wall is located outside the Temple area.\nIn the past, some visitors would write their names on the Wall, or based upon various scriptural verses, would drive nails into the crevices. These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of the Wall. Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long responsa appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper Havatzelet in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration. More recently the Yalkut Yosef rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness. Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a halachic point of view. Blasphemous graffiti once sprayed by a tourist was left visible for months until it began to peel away.\n\nBarefoot approach\nThere was once an old custom of removing one's shoes upon approaching the Wall. A 17th-century collection of special prayers to be said at holy places mentions that \"upon coming to the Western Wall one should remove his shoes, bow and recite...\". Rabbi Moses Reicher wrote that \"it is a good and praiseworthy custom to approach the Western Wall in white garments after ablution, kneel and prostrate oneself in submission and recite \"This is nothing other than the House of God and here is the gate of Heaven.\" When within four cubits of the Wall, one should remove their footwear.\" Over the years the custom of standing barefoot at the Wall has ceased, as there is no need to remove one's shoes when standing by the Wall, because the plaza area is outside the sanctified precinct of the Temple Mount.\n\nMourning over the Temple's destruction\nAccording to Jewish Law, one is obliged to grieve and rend one's garment upon visiting the Western Wall and seeing the desolate site of the Temple. Bach (17th century) instructs that \"when one sees the Gates of Mercy which are situated in the Western Wall, which is the wall King David built, he should recite: Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the nations: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord\". Some scholars write that rending one's garments is not applicable nowadays as Jerusalem is under Jewish control. Others disagree, pointing to the fact that the Temple Mount is controlled by the Muslim waqf and that the mosques which sit upon the Temple site should increase feelings of distress. If one hasn't seen the Wall for over 30 days, the prevailing custom is to rend one's garments, but this can be avoided if one visits on the Sabbath or on festivals. According to Donneal Epstein, a person who has not seen the Wall within the last 30 days should recite: \"Our Holy Temple, which was our glory, in which our forefathers praised You, was burned and all of our delights were destroyed\".\n\nSignificance as place of prayer\nThe Sages of the Talmud stated that anyone who prays at the Temple in Jerusalem, \"it is as if he has prayed before the throne of glory because the gate of heaven is situated there and it is open to hear prayer.\" Jewish Law stipulates that the Silent Prayer should be recited facing towards Jerusalem, the Temple and ultimately the Holy of Holies, as God's bounty and blessing emanates from that spot. It is generally believed that prayer by the Western Wall is particularly beneficial since it was that wall which was situated closest to the Holy of Holies. Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger (1798–1871) writes, making reference to a medieval rabbi, \"since the Theology and ritual Israel's prayers ascend on high there... as one of the great ancient kabbalists Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla said, when the Jews send their prayers from the Diaspora in the direction of Jerusalem, from there they ascend by way of the Western Wall.\" A well-known segula (efficacious remedy) for finding one's soulmate is to pray for 40 consecutive days at the Western Wall, a practice apparently conceived by Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Fisher (1928–2003).\n\nEgalitarian and non-Orthodox prayer\nWhile during the late 19th century, no formal segregation of men and women was to be found at the Wall, conflict erupted in July 1968 when members of the World Union for Progressive Judaism were denied the right to host a mixed-gender service at the site after the Ministry of Religious Affairs insisted on maintaining the gender segregation customary at Orthodox places of worship. The progressives responded by claiming that \"the Wall is a shrine of all Jews, not one particular branch of Judaism.\"\nIn 1988, the small but vocal group called Women of the Wall launched a campaign for recognition of non-Orthodox prayer at the Wall. Their form and manner of prayer elicited a violent response from some Orthodox worshippers and they were subsequently banned from holding services at the site. After repeated attacks by haredim, in 1989 the Women of the Wall petitioned to secure the right of women to pray at the wall without restrictions.\nA decade on, some commentators called for the closure of the Wall unless an acceptable solution to the controversy was found.\nIn 2003 Israel's Supreme Court upheld the ban on non-Orthodox worship at the Wall, disallowing any women from reading publicly from the Torah or wearing traditional prayer shawls at the plaza itself, but instructed the Israeli government to prepare the site of Robinson's Arch to host such events, given that this area does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs. The government responded by allocating Robinson's Arch for such purposes.\nThe Robinson's Arch worship site was inaugurated in August 2004 and has since hosted services by Reform and Conservative groups, as well as services by the Women of the Wall.\nIn 2012, critics still complained about the restrictions at the Western Wall, saying Israel had \"turned a national monument into an ultra-Orthodox synagogue.\"\nIn April 2013 things came to a head. In response to the repeated arrest of women, including Anat Hoffman, found flouting the law, the Jewish Agency observed 'the urgent need to reach a permanent solution and make the Western Wall once again a symbol of unity among the Jewish people, and not one of discord and strife.\" Jewish Agency leader Natan Sharansky spearheaded a concept that would expand and renovate the Robinson's Arch area into an area where people may \"perform worship rituals not based on the Orthodox interpretation of Jewish tradition.\" The Jerusalem District Court ruled that as long as there was no other appropriate area for pluralistic prayer, prayer according to non-Orthodox custom should be allowed at the Wall, and a judge ruled that the 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling prohibiting women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls had been misinterpreted and that Women of the Wall prayer gatherings at the Wall should not be deemed as disturbing the public order.\n\nOn August 25, 2013, a new 4,480 square foot prayer platform named \"Ezrat Yisrael Plaza\" was completed as part of this plan of facilitating non-Orthodox worship, with access to the platform at all hours, even when the rest of the area's archaeological park is closed to visitors. After some controversy regarding the question of authority over this prayer area, the announcement was made that it would come under the authority of a future government-appointed \"pluralist council\" that would include non-Orthodox representatives.\nIn January 2016, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to designate a new space at the Kotel that would be available for egalitarian prayer and that would not be controlled by the Rabbinate. Women of the Wall welcomed the decision, although Sephardic Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar of Jerusalem said creating a mixed-gender prayer section was paramount to destroying the Wall. The Chief Rabbinate said it would create an alternate plan. In June 2017, it was announced that the plan approved in January 2016 had been suspended.\n\nPrayer notes\nThere is a much publicised practice of placing slips of paper containing written prayers into the crevices of the Wall. The earliest account of this practice describes Chaim ibn Attar (d. 1743) writing an amulet for a petitioner and instructing him to place it inside the wall. More than a million notes are placed each year and the opportunity to e-mail notes is offered by a number of organisations. It has become customary for visiting dignitaries to place notes too.\n\nChabad tefillin stand\nShortly after the Western Wall came under Israeli control in 1967, a stand of the Chabad movement offering phylacteries (tefillin) was erected with permission from Rabbi Yehuda Meir Getz, the first rabbi of the Kotel. The stand offers male visitors the chance to put on tefillin, a daily Jewish prayer ritual. In the months following the Six-Day War an estimated 400,000 Jews observed this ritual at the stand. The stand is staffed by multilingual Chabad volunteers and an estimated 100,000 male visitors put on tefillin there annually.\n\nIn Islam\nTradition of the place of tethering\nMuslim reverence for the site is derived from the belief that the Islamic prophet Muhammad tied his winged mount Buraq nearby during his night journey to Jerusalem. Various places have been suggested for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered, but for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq Mosque, which is just inside the wall at the south end of the present Western Wall plaza. The mosque is located above an ancient passageway, which once came out through the long-sealed Barclay's Gate whose huge lintel is still visible directly below the Maghrebi Gate.\nThere are four different locations, along the southern, eastern, and western wall, with gates known successively or simultaneously as the Gate of the Prophet and al-Buraq.\n\nEarly Muslim vs. Mamluk-period traditions\nUS scholar Charles D. Matthews wrote in 1932 that, based on the work of Muslim authors of the 10th to 11th centuries (the later part of the Early Muslim period), the place where Prophet Muhammad had tethered Buraq and entered the haram was considered at the time to be the Double Gate of the Temple Mount's southern wall. To reach this conclusion, which he shares with Charles Wilson and Guy Le Strange, he analysed the relevant texts by Ibn al-Faqih (903), Ibn Abd Rabbih (913), and mainly by Muqaddasi (985) and Nasir-i-Khusrau (1047). One of the earliest authors who are more ambiguous, opening the possibility of identifying the Gate of the Prophet and al-Buraq with either the Double or Barclay's Gate, is Burhan ad-Din ibn al-Firkah of Damascus (d. 1329). Another Mamluk-period writer, Mujir ad-Din (1496), is the first one to unambiguously identify Barclay's Gate as the Gate of al-Buraq or of the Prophet. However, Mujir ad-Din's work is effectively a rework of earlier texts, with as-Suyuti (1471) being the main source—and he fails to mention that as—Suyuti stated that the Gate of the Inspector, located close to the northern end of the western wall, was also known as the Gate of al-Buraq or of the Prophet.\n\nOttoman-period identification\nTo the previously mentioned variations in identification adds yet another gate, the now walled-up Funeral Gate (bab al-jana'iz), just south of the Golden Gate, also known as 'Gate of al-Buraq' and marked as such on a 1864 Temple Mount map by Melchior de Vogüé, based on the 1833 survey by Frederick Catherwood (see Bab al-Rahmah Cemetery at MadainProject.com for a photo and short description).\nWhen a British Jew asked the Egyptian authorities in 1840 for permission to re-pave the ground in front of the Western Wall, the governor of Syria wrote:\n\nIt is evident from the copy of the record of the deliberations of the Consultative Council in Jerusalem that the place the Jews asked for permission to pave adjoins the wall of the Haram al-Sharif and also the spot where al-Buraq was tethered, and is included in the endowment charter of Abu Madyan, may God bless his memory; that the Jews never carried out any repairs in that place in the past. ... Therefore the Jews must not be enabled to pave the place.\nCarl Sandreczki, who was charged with compiling a list of place names for Charles Wilson's Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem in 1865, reported that the street leading to the Western Wall, including the part alongside the wall, belonged to the Hosh (court/enclosure) of al Burâk, \"not Obrâk, nor Obrat\". In 1866, the Prussian Consul and Orientalist Georg Rosen wrote that \"The Arabs call Obrâk the entire length of the wall at the wailing place of the Jews, southwards down to the house of Abu Su'ud and northwards up to the substructure of the Mechkemeh [Shariah court]. Obrâk is not, as was formerly claimed, a corruption of the word Ibri (Hebrews), but simply the neo-Arabic pronunciation of Bōrâk, ... which, whilst (Muhammad) was at prayer at the holy rock, is said to have been tethered by him inside the wall location mentioned above.\"\nThe name Hosh al Buraq appeared on the maps of Wilson's 1865 survey, its revised editions of 1876 and 1900, and other maps in the early 20th century.\n\nBritish Mandate\nIn 1922, Hosh al Buraq was the street name specified by the official Pro-Jerusalem Council.\n\nIn Christianity\nSome scholars believe that when Jerusalem came under Christian rule in the 4th century, there was a purposeful \"transference\" of respect for the Temple Mount and the Western Wall in terms of sanctity to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, while the sites around the Temple Mount became a refuse dump for Christians. However, the actions of many modern Christian leaders, including Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, who visited the Wall and left prayer messages in its crevices, have symbolized for many Christians a restoration of respect and even veneration for this ancient religious site.\n\nIdeological views\nJewish\nMost Jews, religious and secular, consider the wall to be important to the Jewish people since it was originally built to hold the Second Temple. They consider the capture of the wall by Israel in 1967 as a historic event since it restored Jewish access to the site after a 19-year gap.\nIsraeli philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz referred to the attitude towards the Western Wall as \"idolatry\" and publicly decried the Israelis' triumphalism following the 1967 victory.\nDan Bahat, former district archaeologist of Jerusalem who headed the Western Wall Tunnel excavations in the years 1986–2007, decried in 2018 the transformation of this iconic historical site into a regulated place of worship: \"The Western Wall is sacrosanct. But out of a national monument, it has become a synagogue.\"\n\nIsraeli\nA poll carried out in 2007 by the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies indicated that 96% of Israeli Jews were against Israel relinquishing the Western Wall. \nYitzhak Reiter writes that \"the Islamization and de-Judaization of the Western Wall are a recurrent motif in publications and public statements by the heads of the Islamic Movement in Israel.\"\n\nMuslim\nIn December 1973, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia stated that \"Only Muslims and Christians have holy places and rights in Jerusalem\". The Jews, he maintained, had no rights there at all. As for the Western Wall, he said, \"Another wall can be built for them. They can pray against that\".\n\nPalestinian\nThe Palestinian National Authority's State Information Service (SIS) stated as fact that the Jews did not consider the Wall as a place for worship until after the Balfour Declaration was issued in 1917.\nIn 2006, Dr. Hassan Khader, founder of the Al Quds Encyclopedia, told PA television that the first connection of the Jews to the Wall is \"a recent one, which began in the 16th century...not ancient...like the roots of the Islamic connection\".\nThe Mufti of Jerusalem, Sheikh Ekrima Sa'id Sabri said in 2007 that \"there never was a Jewish temple on the Temple Mount\" and that \"there is not a single stone with any relation at all to the history of the Hebrews.\"\nIn November 2010, an official paper published by the PA Ministry of Information denied Jewish rights to the Wall. It stated that \"Al-Buraq Wall is in fact the western wall of Al-Aksa Mosque\" and that Jews had only started using the site for worship after the 1917 Balfour Declaration.\n\nAmerican\nWhile recognizing the difficulties inherent in any ultimate peace agreement that involves the status of Jerusalem, the official position of the United States includes a recognition of the importance of the Wall to the Jewish people, and has condemned statements that seek to \"delegitimize\" the relationship between Jews and the area in general, and the Western Wall in particular. For example, in November 2010, the Obama administration \"strongly condemned a Palestinian official's claim that the Western Wall in the Old City has no religious significance for Jews and is actually Muslim property.\" The U.S. State Department noted that the United States rejects such a claim as \"factually incorrect, insensitive and highly provocative.\"\n\nAdministration\nAfter the 1967 Arab–Israeli war, Rabbi Yehuda Meir Getz was named the overseer of proceedings at the wall. After Rabbi Getz's death in 1995, Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz was given the position. The Western Wall Heritage Foundation is the administrative body put in charge of the Wall.\n\nSee also\nList of artifacts in biblical archaeology\nMughrabi Bridge\nPro–Wailing Wall Committee\nSouthern Wall\nWalls of Jerusalem\nWestern Stone\nWestern Wall camera\nWestern Wall Tunnel\n\nFootnotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThe political role of the Israeli Chief Rabbinate in the Temple Mount question, Yoel Cohen, from the Jewish Political Studies Review, Volume 11:1–2 (Spring 1999), accessed March 2020.\nOfficial website of the Western Wall Heritage Foundation\nJewish Virtual Library: The Western Wall\nChabad.org: The Shofar and the Wall, 1930\nLiberation of the Temple Mount and Western Wall: Historic Live Broadcast on Voice of Israel Radio, June 7th, 1967 Archived February 1, 2016, at the Wayback Machine\nThe Western Wall Online Archived February 19, 2019, at the Wayback Machine – online services related to the Kotel: Prayer note, Live cam, and Information\nPhotographs\n\nWailing Wall to Western Wall (1960s)\nPhotographs of the Western Wall (Summer 2007)\nGoogle Street View\n\nThe Western Wall on Google Street View",
          "summary": "The Western Wall (Hebrew: הַכּוֹתֶל הַמַּעֲרָבִי, romanized: HaKotel HaMa'aravi, lit. 'the western wall'; ; Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation: HaKosel HaMa'arovi) is an ancient retaining wall of the built-up hill known to Jews and Christians as the Temple Mount of Jerusalem. Its most famous section, known by the same name, often shortened by Jews to the Kotel or Kosel, is known in the West as the Wailing Wall, and in Arab world and Islamic world as the Buraq Wall (Arabic: حَائِط ٱلْبُرَاق, romanized: Ḥā'iṭ al-Burāq; ['ħaːʔɪtˤ albʊ'raːq]). In a Jewish religious context, the term Western Wall and its variations is used in the narrow sense, for the section used for Jewish prayer; in its broader sense it refers to the entire 488-metre-long (1,601 ft) retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount.\nAt the prayer section, just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates from the end of the Second Temple period, and is believed to have been begun by Herod the Great. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad period, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.\nThe Western Wall plays an important role in Judaism due to it being part of the man-made \"Temple Mount\", an artificially expanded hilltop best known as the traditional site of the Jewish Temple. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray outside the Temple Mount platform, because the presumed site of the Holy of Holies, the most sacred site in the Jewish faith, presumably lies just above and behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. The earliest source possibly mentioning this specific site as a place of Jewish worship is from the 10th century. The Western Wall, in the narrow sense, i.e. referring to the section used for Jewish prayer, is also known as the \"Wailing Wall\", in reference to the practice of Jews weeping at the site. During the period of  Christian Roman rule over Jerusalem (ca. 324–638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except on Tisha B'Av, the day of national mourning for the Temples. The term \"Wailing Wall\" has historically been used mainly by Christians, with use by Jews becoming marginal. Of the entire retaining wall, the section ritually used by Jews now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the Muslim Quarter, with the small exception of an 8-metre (26 ft) section, the so-called \"Little Western Wall\" or \"Small Wailing Wall\". This segment of the western retaining wall derives particular importance from having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much of the original Herodian stonework. In religious terms, the \"Little Western Wall\" is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the \"presence of God\" (Shechina), and the underground Warren's Gate, which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century.\nThe entire Western Wall constitutes the western border of al-Haram al-Sharif (\"the Noble Sanctuary\"), or the Al-Aqsa compound. It is believed to be the site where the Islamic Prophet Muhammad tied his winged steed, the Burāq, on his Night Journey, which tradition connects to Jerusalem, before ascending to heaven. While the wall was considered an integral part of the Haram esh-Sharif and waqf property of the Moroccan Quarter under Muslim rule, a right of Jewish prayer and pilgrimage has long existed as part of the Status Quo regulations. This position was confirmed in a 1930 international commission during the British Mandate period. \nWith the rise of the Zionist movement in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly riot in 1929 in which 133 Jews and 116 Arabs were killed, with many more people injured. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the Jewish Quarter, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall for 19 years. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the Six-Day War. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site, the Moroccan Quarter was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.",

جنوبًا، والمدرسه التنكزيه شمالاً، طوله نحو 50م، وارتفاعه يقل عن 20م.\n\nساحه الحائط هي حاره المغاربه\nالساحه التي امام الحائط حالياً هي مكان حاره المغاربه سابقاً والتي حوت بيوت المسلمين، عند احتلال القدس قام الاحتلال الاسرائيلي بهدم بيوتهم وطردوهم منها عنوه.\n\nالمكانه الدينيه\nيعتبر من اشهر معالم مدينه القدس، ولهذا الحائط مكانه كبيره عند اتباع الديانتين الاسلاميه واليهوديه. اذ يُذكر في بعض المصادر الاسلاميه على انه الحائط الذي قام الرسول محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم بربط البراق اليه في ليله الاسراء والمعراج.\n\nمكانته عند اليهود\nيعتبر اليهود الحائط الاثر الاخير الباقي من هيكل سليمان. في راي اغلبيه الحاخامين اليهود يكون الدخول الى الحرم القدسي محظورا على اليهود منذ خراب الهيكل، فلذلك الحائط هو اقرب نقطه من مكان الهيكل التي يمكن لليهود الصلاه فيها حسب الشريعه اليهوديه العصريه. واطلق عليه العرب المقدسيون اسم «حائط المبكى» نسبه الى الطقوس التي كان اليهود يؤدونها قباله الحائط حدادًا على خراب هيكل سليمان. \nعلى ما يبدو من تقارير المسافرين اليهود والقرائين، اصبح الحائط مصلى يهوديا مشهورا في بدايه القرن السادس عشر، وتعاظمت اهميته في نظر اليهود في القرن التاسع عشر حتى اصبح اهم المعالم اليهوديه الدينيه في راي اكثريتهم. في نظر بعض اليهود خاصه الاسرائيليين منهم يعتبر الحائط رمزًا يهوديًا وطنيًا ايضًا.\nقبل القرن السادس عشر، كان اليهود يؤدون صلواتهم وطقوس الحداد على خراب هيكل النبي سليمان في اماكن مختلفه حول الحرم القدسي. اول ذكر لذلك يرد في تقرير لحاج مسيحي من مدينه بوردو زار القدس سنه 333 م. يقول المسافر ان اليهود يحتشدون سنويا امام حجر قريبه من السور المحد للحرم القدسي ويتفجعون. في كتاب المسافر اليهودي بنيامين من توديلا الذي زار القدس في نهايه القرن الثاني عشر يذكر مصلىً يهوديًا امام قبه الصخره يسمى «الحائط الغربي» او «باب الرحمه». اما التقرير الاول الذي يشير بوضوح الى المصلى الذي يسمى لدى اليهود الحائط الغربي فهو من 1488 م بقلم الحاخام عبديا من برتانورا.[ما هي؟]\n\nمكانته عند المسلمين\nبالنسبه للمسلمين، يرتبط حائط البراق بقصه الاسراء والمعراج في التاريخ الاسلامي، ومنها جاءت تسميه الحائط حائط البراق نسبه للدابه التي ركبها النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم عند اسرائه ليلا من مكه الى المسجد الاقصى، حيث ربط البراق في حلقه على هذا الحائط، ودخل الى المسجد حيث صلى بالانبياء ثم عُرج به الى السماوات العلا. وقد ورد في الطبقات الكبرى لابن سعد ان الرسول محمد حُمل على البراق حتى انتهى الى بيت المقدس، فانتهى البراق الى موقفه الذي كان يقف في مربطه. كما يعتبره المسلمون جزءا مهما من المسجد الاقصى. وتوارث اهل القدس المسلمون عامه انه يوجد محل يسمى البراق عند باب المسجد الاقصى المدعو باب المغاربه ويجاوره مسجد البراق ملاصقاً الجدار الغربي للحرم القدسي.\nكما ان هذا الحائط هو احد جدران المسجد الاقصى الذي يمثل اولى القبلتين وثالث اقدس المساجد عند المسلمين بعد المسجد الحرام في مكه والمسجد النبوي في المدينه المنوره.\n\nالمكانه السياسيه\nمنذ الفتح الاسلامي لبيت المقدس، ابان خلافه عمر بن الخطاب، تحولت اداره الحرم القدسي وما حوله (بما فيها حائط البراق) للمسلمين بما فيها ذلك فترات الاحتلال الصليبي.\nفي ايام الدوله العثمانيه، سمحت السلطات العثمانيه لليهود المقدسيين اداء بعض الطقوس الدينيه قبال الحائط ولكنها حظرتهم من حط المقاعد قبال الحائط او ايه مبادره اخرى لجعل المكان مصلى يهوديا دائما. في 1887 قام ادموند دي روتشيلد، من يهود فرنسا، بمحاوله فاشله لشراء الحائط وجعله ملكا يهوديا. هذه المحاوله عارضها الحاخامون المقدسيون خشيه من هز العلاقات بين اليهود والسلطات الاسلاميه.\nفي تاريخ 12 نوفمبر 1911 قام متولي الاوقاف ابو مدين الغوث بالاحتجاج حين قام افراد من الطائفه اليهوديه، الذين جرت عادتهم بزياره الحائط وقوفًا، بجلب كراسي للجلوس عليها اثناء الزياره. وطلب متولي الاوقاف ايقاف هذه الحاله تجنباً لادعاء اليهود في المستقبل بملكيه المكان. وبناءً على ذلك اصدر مجلس اداره لواء القدس تعليمات تنظم زياره اليهود للحائط، وتمنع جلب اي مقاعد او ستائر عند الحائط. بعد انتهاء الحرب العالميه الاولى واعتماداً على وعد بلفور الذي يعد باقامه وطن قومي لليهود في فلسطين، اخذ اليهود يسعون الى اكتساب حقوق واسعه لهم في هذا المكان عن طريق تغيير الحاله الراهنه التي كان عليها الحائط قبل الحرب.\nفي يناير 1914 قام الاديب اليهودي دافيد يالين بمبادره اخرى لشراء الحائط. في رساله للسفير الامريكي لدى اسطنبول قال يالين: «نامل ان تفعل كل ما بوسعك لتحرير اقدس الاماكن من بين جميع الاماكن المقدسه في المدينه التي كانت من قبل اروع المدن». في هذه الرساله قدر يالين ثمن الحائط بمليون فرانك فرنسي على الاقل. فشلت هذه المبادره كما فشلت المحاوله التي سبقتها.\nوعندما وضع صك الانتداب على فلسطين الذي صودق عليه من قبل عصبه الامم في 24 يوليو 1922 تضمنت مواده الثمانيه والعشرون عددًا من المواد المتعلقه بالاماكن المقدسه كان اهمها الماده 14التي تنص على ما يلي:\n«تؤلف الدوله المنتدبه لجنه خاصه لدرس وتحقيق وتقرير الحقوق والادعاءات المتعلقه بالاماكن المقدسه والحقوق والادعاءات المتعلقه بالطوائف الدينيه المختلفه في فلسطين وتعرض طريقه اختيار هذه اللجنه وقوامها ووظائفها على مجلس عصبه الامم لاقرارها ولا تعين اللجنه ولا تقوم بوظائفها دون موافقه المجلس المذكور.»\nلكن هذه اللجنه لم تعين. وطوال السنوات 22، 23، 25، 26، 28، كان هناك محاولات يهوديه لجلب مقاعد عند الحائط لكنهم في عام 1928 حاولوا استخدام خزانه ومصابيح وحصر وستائر للفصل بين الرجال والنساء، وارسل مفتي فلسطين رسائل الى حاكم القدس ينبهه الى تلك المخالفات، وصدرت التعليمات من الاداره المنتدبه في اكثر من موقف بمنع اليهود من جلب كراسي او ستائر الى الحائط. عينت اللجنه سابقه الذكر في عام 1930 بعد ان اوصت لجنه التحقيق في اسباب انتفاضه البراق عام 1929 بسرعه تعيينها.\n\nالكتاب الابيض\nفي سنه 1928 صدر كتاب ابيض من الحكومه البريطانيه برقم 3229 مؤيداً المحافظه على الحاله الراهنه داعياً اليهود والمسلمين الى عقد اتفاق فيما بينهم لتحديد حقوقهم وواجباتهم في الاماكن المقدسه.\nلكن الاتفاق لم يحدث، فطلبت الحكومه من الطرفين ابراز ما لديهما من مستندات لتتمكن من الفصل في الموضوع فقدم المجلس الاسلامي ما لديه من مستندات، لكن الجهه اليهوديه المسؤوله لم تقدم ايه مستندات واكتفت بارسال بحث فقهي عن الموضوع.\nوفي هذا الجو المتوتر صدرت قرارات المؤتمر الصهيوني السادس عشر الذي عقد في زيورخ من 28 يوليو الى 11 اغسطس 1929 والتي كان من اهمها المطالبه بفتح ابواب فلسطين على مصراعيها لليهود، وبذل الجهود لحمل الحكومه البريطانيه على سحب كتابها الابيض لعام 1928 الذي اعترف بحقوق المسلمين في الاماكن المقدسه كما عقد فور انتهاء المؤتمر الصهيوني اول اجتماع للوكاله اليهوديه التي جمعت الصهاينه واليهود. وتابعت لجنه الدفاع اليهوديه عن المبكى نداءاتها المقلقه لاثاره يهود العالم الى ان يعاد اليهم حائط المبكى.\n\nاسباب النزاع\nيقول اليهود ان الحائط جزء من الهيكل، قيام اليهود بالبكاء والنواح عنده في العصور المتاخره، على خلفيه ادعاءات متفرقه منها ان الحائط المذكور، هو جزء من بقايا معبدهم القديم، وهو ما تدحضه المعطيات التاريخيه ونتائج التنقيبات عن الاثار، فالموسوعه اليهوديه تقول ان اليهود لم يصلّوا امام هذا الحائط الا في العهد العثماني. يذهب عالم الاثار اليهودي فينكلشتاين -رئيس قسم الاثار في جامعه تل ابيب- هو يقول: «لا يوجد اي سند (يعني اي سند علمي) لما ورد في العهد القديم بشان حائط المبكى)» ويذهب الى ابعد من ذلك بتشكيكه بوجود الهيكل اصلا.\nومن جهه اخرى، اذ ليس هناك اي اثر يثبت وجود الهيكل اليهودي او ما يمكن ان يمت اليه بصله، وان علماء الاثار والمنقبين اليهود انفسهم او الذين استقدمهم اليهود وصلوا الى صخره الاساس في المكان ولم يعثروا على اي دليل مادي مهما كان صغيراً يؤكد صحه الروايات اليهوديه.\nبالنسبه للمسلمين والمقدسيين لا يعدو الامر ان يكون عمليه انتحال مكشوفه يقوم بها اليهود والصهاينه، تنطوي على نسبه الحائط الى تاريخهم. فهم يرون ان العمليه هي استيلاء على المكان دون اي وجه حق، لا فرق في ذلك بين انتزاع ملكيه الاراضي من الفلسطينيين وتهجيرهم من بلادهم بالقوه الغاشمه، وبين اغتصاب حائط البراق الذي يعد ملكا اسلامياً ومعلماً بارزاً من معالم الحرم القدسي.\n\nالوضع الحالي\nفي 1948 دخلت قوات المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه الجزء الشرقي من مدينه القدس ومنعت اليهود الاسرائيليين من اداء الصلاه امام الحائط. في حرب يونيو 1967 احتلت اسرائيل البلده من الاردن فقررت الحكومه الاسرائيليه توسيع الساحه المجاوره للحائط. لهذه الغايه هدمت حي المغاربه الذي كان يوجد قباله الحائط.\n\nالشعائر المقامه فيه\nبركات الشمس : هو عيد يهودي ترجع اصوله لكتاب

          "content": "The Mount of Olives or Mount Olivet (Hebrew: הַר הַזֵּיתִים, romanized: Har ha-Zeitim; Arabic: جبل الزيتون, romanized: Jabal az-Zaytūn; both lit. 'Mount of Olives'; in Arabic also الطور, Aṭ-Ṭūr, 'the Mountain') is a mountain ridge in East Jerusalem, east of and adjacent to Jerusalem's Old City. It is named for the olive groves that once covered its slopes. The southern part of the mount was the Silwan necropolis, attributed to the elite of the ancient Kingdom of Judah. The western slopes of the mount, those facing Jerusalem, have been used as a Jewish cemetery for over 3,000 years and holds approximately 150,000 graves, making it central in the tradition of Jewish cemeteries. Atop the hill lies the Palestinian neighbourhood of At-Tur, a former village that is now part of East Jerusalem.\nSeveral key events in the life of Jesus, as related in the Gospels, took place on the Mount of Olives, and in the Acts of the Apostles it is described as the place from which Jesus ascended to heaven. Because of its association with both Jesus and Mary, the mount has been a site of Christian worship since ancient times and is today a major site of pilgrimage.\n\nGeography and geology\nThe Mount of Olives is one of three peaks of a mountain ridge which runs for 3.5 kilometres (2.2 miles) just east of the Old City of Jerusalem across the Kidron Valley, in the area called the Valley of Josaphat. The peak to its north is Mount Scopus, at 826 metres (2,710 feet), while the peak to its south is the Mount of Corruption (or the Mount of Offence), at 747 m (2,451 ft). \nThe Mount of Olives itself also consists of three distinct peaks. The middle peak has a double summit: its eastern top contains the Russian Orthodox Convent of the Ascension and an Islamic maqam, while its western top supports the Palestinian town of At-Tur and the Chapel of the Ascension, at 818 m (2,684 ft). The southern head is topped by the Church of the Pater Noster complex. The northern head is known as \"Kurm es Saiad,\" or the Vineyard of the Hunter, and contains the Viri Galilaei Church.\nThe ridge is formed of oceanic sedimentary rock from the Late Cretaceous and contains a soft chalk and a hard flint. While the chalk areas are easily quarried, they are not a suitable strength for construction and features many man-made burial caves. The ridge acts as a watershed, and its eastern side is the beginning of the Judean Desert.\n\nHistory\nFrom Biblical times until the present, Jews have been buried on the Mount of Olives. The necropolis on the southern ridge, the location of the modern village of Silwan, was the burial place of Jerusalem's most important citizens in the period of the Biblical kings.\nThe religious ceremony marking the start of a new month was held on the Mount of Olives during the Second Temple period. During the time of the Roman procurator Antonius Felix (52–60 CE), a Jewish prophetic figure known as \"the Egyptian\" gathered his followers atop the Mount of Olives in preparation for an invasion of the city or in the belief that he would cause the walls of Jerusalem to fall, allowing them to enter (depending on the version). This group was crushed by the Romans. While \"the Egyptian\" managed to flee, many of his followers were killed or taken captive, and the remainder escaped.\nRoman soldiers from the 10th Legion camped on the mount during the Siege of Jerusalem in the year 70 AD. After the destruction of the Second Temple, Jews celebrated the festival of Sukkot on the Mount of Olives. They made pilgrimages to the Mount of Olives because it was 80 meters higher than the Temple Mount and offered a panoramic view of the Temple site. It became a traditional place for lamenting the Temple's destruction, especially on Tisha B'Av. In 1481, an Italian Jewish pilgrim, Meshullam of Volterra, wrote: \"And all the community of Jews, every year, goes up to Mount Zion on the day of Tisha B'Av to fast and mourn, and from there they move down along Yoshafat Valley and up to Mount of Olives. From there they see the whole Temple (the Temple Mount) and there they weep and lament the destruction of this House.\"\nIn 1189, in the wake of the 1187 Battle of Hattin and reconquest of the land by Saladin, the sultan gave the Mount to two of his commanders.\nIn the mid-1850s, the villagers of Silwan were paid £100 annually by the Jews in an effort to prevent the desecration of graves on the mount.\nPrime Minister of Israel Menachem Begin asked to be buried on the Mount of Olives near the graves of Etzel members Meir Feinstein and Moshe Barazani, rather than Mount Herzl national cemetery.\n\nStatus since 1948\nThe armistice agreement signed by Israel and Jordan following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War called for the establishment of a Special Committee to negotiate developments including \"free access to the holy sites and cultural institutions and use of the cemetery on the Mount of Olives\". However, during the 19 years the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank lasted, the committee was not formed. Non-Israeli Christian pilgrims were allowed to visit the mount, but Jews of all countries and most non-Jewish Israeli citizens were barred from entering Jordan and therefore were unable to travel to the area.\nBy the end of 1949, and throughout the Jordanian rule of the site, some Arab residents uprooted tombstones and plowed the land in the cemeteries, and an estimated 38,000 tombstones were damaged in total. During this period, a road was paved through the cemetery, in the process destroying graves including those of famous persons. In 1964, the Intercontinental Hotel was built at the summit of the mount. Graves were also demolished for parking lots and a filling station and were used in latrines at a Jordanian Army barracks.\n\nState of Israel\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War restoration work was done and the cemetery was reopened for burials. Tombs in the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery have been prone to vandalism, among them the tombs of the Gerrer Rebbe and Menachem Begin.\nIsrael's 1980 unilateral annexation of East Jerusalem was condemned as a violation of international law and ruled null and void by the UN Security Council in UNSC Resolution 478.\nOn 6 November 2010, an international watch-committee was set up by Diaspora Jews with the aim of reversing the desecration of the Jewish cemetery. According to one of the founders, the initiative was triggered by witnessing tombstones that were wrecked with \"the kind of maliciousness that defies the imagination.\"\n\nReligious significance\nHebrew Bible references\nDavid and Absalom\nThe Mount of Olives is first mentioned in connection with David's flight from Absalom\n(II Samuel 15:30): \"And David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up.\" The ascent was probably east of the City of David, near the village of Silwan.\n\nSite of \"the glory of the Lord\"\nThe sacred character of the mount is alluded to in the Book of Ezekiel (11:23): \"And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.\"\n\n\"Mount of Corruption\"\nThe biblical designation \"Mount of Corruption,\" \"Mount of Ruination\" or \"Mount of Offense,\" or in Hebrew Har HaMashchit (הר־המשחית), derives from the idol worship there, begun by King Solomon building altars to the gods of his Moabite and Ammonite wives on the southern peak, \"on the mountain which is before (east of) Jerusalem\" (1 Kings 11:7), just outside the limits of the holy city. This site was known for idol worship throughout the First Temple period, until King Josiah finally destroyed \"the high places that were before Jerusalem, to the right of Har HaMashchit...\"(II Kings 23:13).\n\nApocalypse, resurrection, and burials\nAn apocalyptic prophecy in the Book of Zechariah states that YHWH will stand on the Mount of Olives and the mountain will split in two, with one half shifting north and one half shifting south (Zechariah 14:4). According to the Masoretic Text, people will flee through this newly formed valley to a place called Azal (Zechariah 14:5). The Septuagint (LXX) has a different reading of Zechariah 14:5 stating that a valley will be blocked up as it was blocked up during the earthquake during King Uzziah's reign. Jewish historian Flavius Josephus mentions in Antiquities of the Jews that the valley in the area of the King's Gardens was blocked up by landslide rubble during Uzziah's earthquake. Israeli geologists Wachs and Levitte identified the remnant of a large landslide on the Mount of Olives directly adjacent to this area. Based on geographic and linguistic evidence, Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, a 19th-century linguist and archeologist in Palestine, theorized that the valley directly adjacent to this landslide is Azal. This evidence accords with the LXX reading of Zechariah 14:5, which states that the valley will be blocked up as far as Azal. The valley he identified (which is now known as Wady Yasul in Arabic, and Nahal Etzel in Hebrew) lies south of both Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives.\nMany Jews have wanted to be buried on the Mount of Olives since antiquity, based on the Jewish tradition (from the Biblical verse Zechariah 14:4) that when the Messiah comes, the resurrection of the dead will begin there. There are an estimated 150,000 graves on the Mount. Notable rabbis buried on the mount include Chaim ibn Attar and others from the 15th century to the present day. Tradition wrongly identifies Roman-period tombs at the foot of the mount as those of Zechariah and Absalom, and a burial complex of the same period on the upper slope as the Tomb of the Prophets Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi.\n\nNew Testament references\nThe Mount of Olives is frequently mentioned in the New Testament as part of the route from Jerusalem to Bethany and the place where Jesus stood when he wept over Jerusalem (an event known as Flevit super illam in Latin).\nJesus is said to have spent time on the mount, teaching and prophesying to his disciples (Matthew 24–25), including the Olivet Discourse, returning after each day to rest (Luke 21:37, and John 8:1 in the additional section of John's Gospel known as the Pericope Adulterae), and also coming there on the night of his betrayal. At the foot of the Mount of Olives lies the Garden of Gethsemane. The New Testament tells how Jesus and his disciples sang together – \"When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives\" Gospel of Matthew 26:30. Jesus ascended to heaven from the Mount of Olives according to Acts 1:9–12.\n\nGnostic references\nAgain, the story of Jesus with his disciples on the Mount of Olives can be found in the Gnostic text Pistis Sophia, dated around the 3rd to 4th century CE.\n\nLandmarks\nLandmarks at the top of the Mount of Olives include the Augusta Victoria Hospital with the Lutheran Church of the Ascension and its massive 50-metre (160 ft) bell tower, the Russian Orthodox Convent of the Ascension with its tall and slender bell tower, the Mosque or Chapel of the Ascension, the Church of the Pater Noster, and the Seven Arches Hotel. On the western slope are the historic Jewish cemetery, the Tomb of the Prophets, the Catholic Church of Dominus Flevit, and the Russian Orthodox Church of Mary Magdalene. At the foot of the mount, where it meets the Kidron Valley, there is the Garden of Gethsemane with the Church of All Nations. Within the Kidron Valley itself are the Tomb of the Virgin Mary, the Grotto of Gethsemane, and the nearby tomb of the medieval historian Mujir ed-Din, and further south are the tombs of Absalom (Hebrew name: Yad Avshalom), the Hezir priestly family and of Zechariah. At the northern margin of Mount Olivet stand the Mormon University with the Orson Hyde Memorial Garden and the Jewish settlement of Beit Orot, bordering on the Tzurim Valley and the Mitzpe Hamasu'ot ('Beacons Lookout') site, where the Temple Mount Sifting Project facilities are located. What lays north of here belongs to Mount Scopus. On the south-eastern slope of the Mount of Olives lies the Palestinian Arab village of al-Eizariya, identified with the ancient village of Bethany mentioned in the New Testament; a short distance from the village centre, towards the top of the mount, is the traditional site of Bethphage, marked by a Franciscan church.\nThe construction of the Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies, better known locally as the Mormon University, owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) near the Tzurim Valley which separates the Mount of Olives from Mount Scopus, initially sparked controversy because of concerns that the Mormons would engage in missionary activities. After the Mormons pledged not to proselytize in Israel, work on the building was allowed to proceed.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nMount of Olives Jewish Cemetery\nBeit Orot, Jewish settlement on the Mount of Olives\nMa'ale ha-Zeitim, Jewish settlement on the Mount of Olives\nOlivet (disambiguation)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Mount of Olives at Wikimedia Commons\nMount of Olives website\nHar Hazeitim website\nInteractive Panoramas of the Mount of Olives – jerusalem360.com, GoJerusalem.com\n\"Olives, Mount of\" .

          "summary": "The Mount of Olives or Mount Olivet (Hebrew: הַר הַזֵּיתִים, romanized: Har ha-Zeitim; Arabic: جبل الزيتون, romanized: Jabal az-Zaytūn; both lit. 'Mount of Olives'; in Arabic also الطور, Aṭ-Ṭūr, 'the Mountain') is a mountain ridge in East Jerusalem, east of and adjacent to Jerusalem's Old City. It is named for the olive groves that once covered its slopes. The southern part of the mount was the Silwan necropolis, attributed to the elite of the ancient Kingdom of Judah. The western slopes of the mount, those facing Jerusalem, have been used as a Jewish cemetery for over 3,000 years and holds approximately 150,000 graves, making it central in the tradition of Jewish cemeteries. Atop the hill lies the Palestinian neighbourhood of At-Tur, a former village that is now part of East Jerusalem.\nSeveral key events in the life of Jesus, as related in the Gospels, took place on the Mount of Olives, and in the Acts of the Apostles it is described as the place from which Jesus ascended to heaven. Because of its association with both Jesus and Mary, the mount has been a site of Christian worship since ancient times and is today a major site of pilgrimage.",

          "content": "The Cave of the Patriarchs or Tomb of the Patriarchs, known to Jews by its Biblical name Cave of Machpelah (Biblical Hebrew: מְעָרַת הַמַּכְפֵּלָה, romanized: , lit. 'Cave of the Double') and to Muslims as the Ibrahami Mosque (Arabic: المسجد الإبراهيمي, romanized: al-Masjid al-ʾibrāhīmī), or Sanctuary of Ibrahim (Arabic: الحرم الإبراهيمي, romanized: ), is a series of caves situated in the heart of the Old City of Hebron in the West Bank, 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of Jerusalem. According to the Abrahamic religions, the cave and adjoining field were purchased by Abraham as a burial plot, although most historians believe the Abraham-Isaac-Jacob narrative to be primarily mythological. The site is considered a holy place in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\nOver the cave stands a large rectangular enclosure dating from the Herodian era. During Byzantine rule of the region, a Christian basilica was built on the site; the structure was converted into the Ibrahimi Mosque following the Muslim conquest of the Levant. By the 12th century, the mosque and its surrounding regions had fallen under Crusader-state control, but were retaken in 1188 by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin, who again converted the structure into a mosque. In 1119 CE, a monk found bones inside the cave, believing them to be the bones of the patriarchs. \nDuring the Six-Day War of 1967, the entire Jordanian-ruled West Bank was seized and occupied by the State of Israel, after which the mosque was divided, with half of it repurposed as a synagogue. In 1968, special Jewish services were authorized outside the usual permitted hours on the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement, leading to a hand-grenade attack on 9 October which injured 47 Israelis; and a second bombing on 4 November, which wounded 6 people. In 1972, the Israeli government increased the Jewish prayer area. New changes to the \"status quo\" were made by Israeli authorities in 1975, which again led to protests by Muslims. \nIn 1976, a scuffle took place between Jewish and Muslim worshippers, during which a Quran was torn. Muslim and Arab figures went to Hebron the next day to protest what was called a \"profanation of the Quran\". The Tomb was closed and a curfew was imposed on the whole city. A few days later, about two hundred Arab youths entered the Tomb and destroyed Torah scrolls and prayer books. In May 1980, an attack on Jewish worshippers returning from prayers at the tomb left 6 dead and 17 wounded. In 1994, the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre occurred at the Ibrahimi Mosque, in which an armed Israeli settler entered the complex during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and opened fire on Palestinian Muslims who had gathered to pray at the site, killing 29 people, including children, and wounding over 125.\n\nEtymology of \"Makhpela\"\nAmoraic proposals\nThe etymology of the Biblical name for the site, Me'arat haMakhpela, is uncertain. The word Me'arat means \"cave of\" and haMakhpela may mean \"doubled\", \"multiplied\" or \"twofold\", so a literal translation would be \"cave of the double\". Two hypotheses are discussed by the Talmud in b. Eruvin 53a:The cave of makhpela: Abba Arikha and Samuel of Nehardea [disputed]; one said, \"It is two chambers, one behind the other\", and one said, \"It is two chambers, one above the other.\"The position that the chambers are stacked is satisfactory—this is makhpela. However, according to the position that one is behind the other, what is makhpela? That it is doubled in [that it contains] couples:\"And Jacob came to his father Isaac, [to] Mamre, the 'City of the Four' which is Hebron ...\" (Gen. 35:27). Isaac the Smith said, \"The City of the Four Couples: Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, and Jacob and Leah\".According to b. Bava Batra 58a, Abba Arikha and Samuel of Nehardea agreed that the two chambers, whatever their layout, shared identical dimensions. Genesis Rabbah 58 gives a third hypothesis:\"And Epron's field which was in the makhpela ...\" (Gen. 23:17). This teaches that it universally \"doubles\" the renown of those [within], as whoever is interred within is believed to have earned a very great reward [in Heaven].\n\nLater scholarship\nSaadia b. Joseph and Abraham ibn Ezra believed it referred to a \"cave within a cave\". Another hypothesis, supported by Samuel b. Meir, Moses b. Nachman, Obadiah Sforno, Moses Mendelssohn, Ernst Rosenmüller, and Samuel David Luzzatto, holds that makhpela isn't an adjective describing the cave but rather is a proper noun describing the tract of land on which it sits. This hypothesis is supported by the phrasing of some Bible verses, such as Genesis 49:30, \"the cave in the field of the Makhpela . . .\" The question over the right interpretation of makhpela has been discussed extensively in various Biblical commentaries.\nStrong's Concordance derives makhpela from kaphal, a verb meaning “to double”.\n\nBiblical origin\nAccording to Genesis 23:1–20, Abraham's wife Sarah dies in Kiryat Arba near Hebron in the land of Canaan at the age of 127, being the only woman in the Bible whose exact age is given, while Abraham is tending to business elsewhere. Abraham comes to mourn for her. After a while he stands up and speaks to the Biblical Hittites. He tells them that he is a foreigner in their land and requests that they give him a burial site so that he can bury his dead. The Hittites flatter Abraham, call him a Lord and mighty prince, and say that he can bury his dead in any of their tombs. Abraham doesn't take them up on their offer and instead asks them to contact Ephron the Hittite, the son of Zohar, who lives in Mamre and owns the cave of Machpelah which he is offering to buy for \"the full price\". Ephron slyly replies that he is prepared to give Abraham the field and the cave within it, knowing that it would not result in Abraham having a permanent claim to it. Abraham politely refuses the offer and insists on paying for the field. Ephron replies that the field is worth four hundred shekels of silver and Abraham agrees to the price without any further bargaining. He then proceeded to bury his dead wife Sarah there.\nThe burial of Sarah is the first account of a burial in the Bible, and Abraham's purchase of Machpelah is the first commercial transaction mentioned.\nThe next burial in the cave is that of Abraham himself, who at the age of 175 years was buried by his sons Isaac and Ishmael. The title deed to the cave was part of the property of Abraham that passed to his son Isaac. The third burial was that of Isaac, by his two sons Esau and Jacob, who died when he was 180 years old. There is no mention of how or when Isaac's wife Rebecca died, but she is included in the list of those that had been buried in Machpelah in Jacob's final words to the children of Israel. Jacob himself died at the age of 147 years.\nIn the final chapter of Genesis, Joseph had his physicians embalm his father Jacob, before they removed him from Egypt to be buried in the cave of the field of Machpelah. When Joseph died in the last verse, he was also embalmed. He was buried much later in Shechem after the children of Israel came into the Promised Land.\n\nExtra-biblical parallels\nIn the Ugaritic texts (13th–12th century BCE), three out of the six real estate contracts discovered were for the sum of 400 silver shekels, and the terms of sale in them parallel the Biblical description of the sale of Machpelah. Apparently 400 shekels was a common price for Canaanite real estate transactions in this period.\n\nHistory\nFirst and Second Temple period\nIn 2020, Israeli archaeologists led by David Ben-Shlomo (Ariel University) dated pottery from the caves (recovered surreptitiously by local residents in 1981) to the 8th century BCE. The different origins of the shards, from various areas around Hebron and Jerusalem, suggest the site may have been a pilgrimage site as early as this date, according to the study authors.\nThe time from which the Israelites regarded the site as sacred is unknown, though some scholars consider that the biblical story of Abraham's burial there probably dates from the 6th century BCE.\nBetween 31 and 4 BCE, Herod the Great built a large, rectangular enclosure over the cave to commemorate the site for his subjects. It is the only fully surviving Herodian structure from the period of Hellenistic Judaism. Herod's building, with 6-foot-thick (1.8 m) stone walls made from stones that were at least 3 feet (0.91 m) tall and sometimes reach a length of 24 feet (7.3 m), did not have a roof. Archaeologists are not certain where the original entrance to the enclosure was located, or even if there was one. The Herodian building stands on an earlier structure possibly built during the Hasmonean dynasty (c. 2nd century BCE).\n\nByzantine Christian period\nUntil the era of the Byzantine Empire, the interior of the enclosure remained exposed to the sky. Under Byzantine rule, a simple basilica was constructed at the southeastern end and the enclosure was roofed everywhere except at the centre.\nDuring this period, the site became an important Christian pilgrimage destination. The Pilgrim of Bordeaux, c. 333, reported \"a monument of square form built of stone of wondrous beauty, in which lie Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sara, Rebecca, and Leah\". The Piacenza Pilgrim (c. 570) noted in his pilgrimage account that Jews and Christians shared possession of the site.\n\nArab period\nIn 614, the Sasanid Persians conquered the area and destroyed the castle, leaving only ruins; but in 637, the area came under the control of the Arab Muslims and the building was reconstructed as a roofed mosque.\nThe Muslims permitted the building of two small synagogues at the site.\nDuring the 10th century, an entrance was pierced through the north-eastern wall, some way above the external ground level, and steps from the north and from the east were built up to it (one set of steps for entering, the other for leaving). A building known as the qal'ah (قلعة i.e. castle) was also constructed near the middle of the southwestern side. Its purpose is unknown but one historic account claims that it marked the spot where Joseph was buried (see Joseph's Tomb), the area having been excavated by a Muslim caliph, under the influence of a local tradition regarding Joseph's tomb. Some archaeologists believe that the original entrance to Herod's structure was in the location of the qal'ah and that the northeastern entrance was created so that the kalah could be built by the former entrance.\n\nCrusader period\nIn 1100, after the area was captured by the Crusaders, the enclosure once again became a church and Muslims were no longer permitted to enter. During this period, the area was given a new gabled roof, clerestory windows and vaulting.\nWhen the Crusaders took control of the site Jews were banned from using the synagogues.\nIn the year 1113 during the reign of Baldwin II of Jerusalem, according to Ali of Herat (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and \"a number of Franks had made their entrance therein\". And they discovered \"(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob\", \"their shrouds having fallen to pieces, lying propped up against a wall. ... Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more\". Similar information is given in Ibn al Athir's Chronicle under the year 1119; \"In this year was opened the tomb of Abraham, and those of his two sons Isaac and Jacob. ... Many people saw the Patriarch. Their limbs had nowise been disturbed, and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver.\" The Damascene nobleman and historian Ibn al-Qalanisi in his chronicle also alludes at this time to the discovery of relics purported to be those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a discovery that excited eager curiosity among all three communities in the southern Levant, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian.\nTowards the end of the period of Crusader rule, in 1166 Maimonides visited Hebron and wrote, \"On Sunday, 9 Marheshvan (17 October), I left Jerusalem for Hebron to kiss the tombs of my ancestors in the Cave. On that day, I stood in the cave and prayed, praise be to God, (in gratitude) for everything.\"\nIn 1170, Benjamin of Tudela visited the city, which he called by its Frankish name, St. Abram de Bron. He reported:\n\n\"Here that there is the great church called St. Abram, and this was a Jewish place of worship at the time of the Mohammedan rule, but the Gentiles have erected there six tombs, respectively called those of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah. The custodians tell the pilgrims that these are the tombs of the Patriarchs, for which information the pilgrims give them money. If a Jew comes, however, and gives a special reward, the custodian of the cave opens unto him a gate of iron, which was constructed by our forefathers, and then he is able to descend below by means of steps, holding a lighted candle in his hand. He then reaches a cave, in which nothing is to be found, and a cave beyond, which is likewise empty, but when he reaches the third cave behold there are six sepulchres, those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, respectively facing those of Sarah, Rebekah and Leah, upon which the names of the three Patriarchs and their wives are inscribed in Hebrew characters. The cave is filled with barrels containing bones of people, which are taken there as to a sacred place. At the end of the field of the Machpelah stands Abraham's house with a spring in front of it\".\n\nAyyubid period\nIn 1188 Saladin conquered the area, reconverting the enclosure to a mosque but allowing Christians to continue worshipping there. Saladin also added a minaret at each corner—two of which still survive—and added an existing minbar (pulpit) from the Shrine of Husayn's Head near Ascalon to the mosque's interior. Samuel ben Samson visited the cave in 1210; he says that the visitor must descend by twenty-four steps in a passageway so narrow that the rock touches him on either hand.\n\nMamluk period\nBetween 1318 and 1320, the Mamluk governor of Gaza, a province that included Hebron, Sanjar al-Jawli ordered the construction of the Amir Jawli Mosque within the Haram enclosure to enlarge the prayer space and accommodate worshipers. In the late 14th century, under the Mamluks, two additional entrances were pierced into the western end of the south western side and the kalah was extended upwards to the level of the rest of the enclosure. A cenotaph in memory of Joseph was created in the upper level of the kalah so that visitors to the enclosure would not need to leave and travel round the outside just to pay respects. The Mamluks also built the northwestern staircase and the six cenotaphs (for Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob, Leah, Abraham, and Sarah, respectively), distributed evenly throughout the enclosure. The Mamluks forbade Jews from entering the site, allowing them only as close as the fifth step on a staircase at the southeast, but after some time this was increased to the seventh step.\nThe Jewish geographer Ishtori Haparchi, who visited the site in the 14th century, reported that a large square of high wall surrounded the tomb. According to a local tradition he recorded there, the stones of the wall were taken from the Temple built by King Solomon.\n\nOttoman period\nDuring the Ottoman period, the dilapidated state of the patriarchs' tombs was restored, with Ali Bey, one of the few foreigners to gain access, reporting in 1807 that,all the sepulchres of the patriarchs are covered with rich carpets of green silk, magnificently embroidered with gold; those of the wives are red, embroidered in like manner. The sultans of Constantinople furnish these carpets, which are renewed from time to time. Ali Bey counted nine, one over the other, upon the sepulchre of Abraham.\nA contemporary traveller, M. Ermete Pierotti, in 1862 described the great jealousy with which the Muslims guarded the sanctuary and the practice of sending petitions to the patriarchs:\n\nThe true entrance to the Patriarchs' tomb is to be seen close to the western wall of the enclosure, and near the north-west comer; it is guarded by a very thick iron railing, and I was not allowed to go near it. I observed that the Mussulmans themselves did not go very near it. In the court opposite the entrance gate of the Mosque, there is an opening, through which I was allowed to go down for three steps, and I was able to ascertain by sight and touch that the rock exists there, and to conclude it to be about five feet thick. From the short observations I could make during my brief descent, as also from the consideration of the east wall of the Mosque, and the little information I extracted from the Chief Santon, who jealously guards the sanctuary, I consider that a part of the grotto exists under the Mosque, and that the other part is under the court, but at a lower level than that lying under the Mosque. This latter must be separated from the former by a vertical stratum of rock which contains an opening, as I conclude, for two reasons : first, because the east wall being entirely solid and massive, requires a good foundation; secondly, because the petitions which the Mussulmans present to the Santon to be transmitted to the Patriarchs are thrown, some through one opening, some through the other, according to the Patriarch to whom they are directed; and the Santon goes down by the way I went, whence I suppose that on that side there is a vestibule, and that the tombs may be found below it. I explained my conjectures to the Santon himself after leaving the Mosque, and he showed himself very much surprised at the time, and told the Pacha afterwards that I knew more about it than the Turks themselves. The fact is that even the Pacha who governs the province has no right to penetrate into the sacred enclosure, where (according to the Mussulman legend) the Patriarchs are living, and only condescend to receive the petitions addressed to them by mortals.\n\nBritish mandate on Palestine\nJordanian control\nAfter Jordan occupied the West Bank in 1948, no Jews were allowed in the territory and consequently no Jews could visit the tomb. In the 1960s, Jordan renovated the area surrounding the mosque, destroying several historical buildings in the process, among them, the ruins of the nearby Crusader fortress built in 1168.\n\nIsraeli control\nFollowing the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in the Six-Day War, Hebron came under Jewish control for the first time in 2,000 years, though restrictions on visits by Jews were to continue.  According to the autobiography of the Chief Rabbi of the Israel Defense Forces, Major general Rabbi Shlomo Goren, during the Six-Day War on 8 June 1967, he made his way from Gush Etzion to Hebron. In Hebron he realized that the Arabs had surrendered and quickly made his way to the Cave of the Patriarchs. He shot at the doors of the mosque with his Uzi submachine gun. But when that was ineffective in prying the doors open, he attached chains to his Jeep and the doors, proceeding to pull them down. He entered the mosque and began to pray. While praying, a messenger from the Mufti of Hebron delivered a surrender note to him, whereby the rabbi replied \"This place, Ma'arat HaMachpela, is a place of prayer and peace. Surrender elsewhere.\"\nThe first Jew to enter the burial caves was Michal Arbel, the 13-year-old daughter of Yehuda Arbel, chief of Shin Bet operations in the West Bank, because she was slender enough to be lowered into the narrow, 28 centimetres (11 in) wide hole on 9 October 1968, to gain access to the tomb site, after which she took photographs.\nIsraeli settlers reestablished a small synagogue under the mosque. The first Jewish wedding ceremony to take place in it was on 7 August 1968. The stone stairway leading to the mosque was also destroyed in order to erase the humiliating \"seventh step\".\nIn 1968, a special arrangement was made to accommodate Jewish services on the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement. This led to an attack on worshippers, with a hand-grenade being thrown on the stairway leading to the tomb on 9 October; 47 Israelis were injured, 8 seriously. On 4 November, a large explosion went off near the gate to the compound and 6 people, Jews and Arabs, were wounded. On Yom Kippur eve, 3 October 1976, an Arab mob destroyed several Torah scrolls and prayer books at the tomb. In May 1980, an attack on Jewish worshippers returning from prayers at the tomb left 6 dead and 17 wounded.\nIn 1981, a group of Jewish settlers from the Hebron community led by Noam Arnon broke into the caves and took photos of the burial chambers.\nTensions would later increase as the Israeli government signed the Oslo Accords in September 1993, which gave limited autonomy to the PLO in the West Bank city of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. The city of Hebron and the rest of the major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank were not included in the initial agreement. The Cave of the Patriarchs massacre committed by Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli-American settler in February 1994, left 29 Palestinian Muslims dead and scores injured. The resulting riots resulted in a further 35 deaths.\n\nThe increased sensitivity of the site meant that in 1996 the Wye River Accords, part of the Arab–Israeli peace process, included a temporary status agreement for the site restricting access for both Jews and Muslims. As part of this agreement, the waqf (Islamic charitable trust) controls 81% of the building. This includes the whole of the southeastern section, which lies above the only known entrance to the caves and possibly over the entirety of the caves themselves. As a consequence, Jews are not permitted to visit the Cenotaphs of Isaac or Rebecca, which lie entirely within the southeastern section, except for 10 days a year that hold special significance in Judaism. One of these days is the Shabbat Chayei Sarah, when the Torah portion concerning the death of Sarah and the purchase by Abraham of the land in which the caves are situated, is read.\nThe Israeli authorities do not allow Jewish religious authorities the right to maintain the site and allow only the waqf to do so. Tourists are permitted to enter the site. Security at the site has increased since the Intifada; the Israel Defense Forces surround the site with soldiers and control access to the shrines. Israeli forces also subject locals to checkpoints and bar all non-Jews from setting foot on some of the main roads to the complex and ban Palestinian vehicles from many of the roads in the area.\nOn 21 February 2010, Israel announced that it would include the site in a national heritage site protection and rehabilitation plan. The announcement sparked protests from the UN, Arab governments and the United States. A subsequent UNESCO vote in October aimed to affirm that the \"al-Haram al-Ibrahimi/Tomb of the Patriarchs in al-Khalil/Hebron\"\nwas \"an integral part of the occupied Palestinian Territories.\"\nIsraeli authorities have placed restrictions on calling the faithful to prayer by the muezzin of the Ibrahimi mosque. The order was enforced 61 times in October 2014, and 52 times in December of that year. This was following numerous complaints by the Jewish residents who claim that the calls violate legal decibel limits. In December 2009 Israeli authorities banned Jewish music played at the cave following similar complaints from the Arab residents.\n\nStructure\nBuilding\nThe rectangular stone enclosure lies on a northwest–southeast axis, and is divided into two sections by a wall running between the northwestern three fifths, and the southeastern two fifths. The northwestern section is roofed on three sides, the central area and north eastern side being open to the sky; the southeastern section is fully roofed, the roof being supported by four columns evenly distributed through the section.\nNearly the entire building itself was built by King Herod and it remains the only Herodian building surviving today virtually intact.\n\nIn the northwestern section are four cenotaphs, each housed in a separate octagonal room, those dedicated to Jacob and Leah being on the northwest, and those to Abraham and Sarah on the southeast. A corridor runs between the cenotaphs on the northwest, and another between those on the southeast. A third corridor runs the length of the southwestern side, through which access to the cenotaphs, and to the southeastern section, can be gained. An entrance to the enclosure exists on the southwestern side, entering this third corridor; a mosque outside this entrance must be passed through to gain access.\nAt the center of the northeastern side, there is another entrance, which enters the roofed area on the southeastern side of the northwestern section and through which access can also be gained to the southeastern (fully roofed) section. This entrance is approached on the outside by a corridor which leads from a long staircase running most of the length of the northwestern side. The southeastern section, which functions primarily as a mosque, contains two cenotaphs, symmetrically placed, near the center, dedicated to Isaac and Rebecca. Between them, in the southeastern wall, is a mihrab. The cenotaphs have a distinctive red and white horizontal striped pattern to their stonework but are usually covered by decorative cloth.\nUnder the present arrangements, Jews are restricted to entering by the southwestern side, and limited to the southwestern corridor and the corridors that run between the cenotaphs, while Muslims may enter only by the northeastern side but are allowed free rein of the remainder of the enclosure.\n\nCaves\nThe caves under the enclosure are not themselves generally accessible; the waqf have historically prevented access to the actual tombs out of respect for the dead. Only two entrances are known to exist, the most visible of which is located to the immediate southeast of Abraham's cenotaph on the inside of the southeastern section. This entrance is a narrow shaft covered by a decorative grate, which itself is covered by an elaborate dome. The other entrance is located to the southeast, near the mihrab, and is sealed by a large stone, and usually covered by prayer mats; this is very close to the location of the seventh step on the outside of the enclosure, beyond which the Mamelukes forbade Jews from approaching.\nWhen the enclosure was controlled by crusaders, access was occasionally possible. One account, by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela dating from 1163 CE, states that after passing through an iron door, and descending, the caves would be encountered. According to Benjamin of Tudela, there was a sequence of three caves, the first two of which were empty; in the third cave were six tombs, arranged to be opposite to one another.\n\nThese caves had been rediscovered only in 1119 CE by a monk named Arnoul, after an unnamed monk at prayer \"noticed a draught\" in the area near the present location of the mihrab and, with other \"brethren\", removed the flagstones and found a room lined with Herodian masonry. Arnoul, still searching for the source of the draught, hammered on the cave walls until he heard a hollow sound, pulled down the masonry in that area, and discovered a narrow passage. The narrow passage, which subsequently became known as the serdab (Arabic for passage), was similarly lined with masonry, but partly blocked up. Having unblocked the passage, Arnoul discovered a large round room with plastered walls. In the floor of the room, he found a square stone slightly different from the others and, upon removing it, found the first of the caves. The caves were filled with dust. After removing the dust, Arnoul found bones; believing the bones to be those of the biblical Patriarchs, Arnoul washed them in wine and stacked them neatly. Arnoul carved inscriptions on the cave walls describing whose bones he believed them to be.This passage to the caves was sealed at some time after Saladin had recaptured the area, though the roof of the circular room was pierced, and a decorative grate was placed over it. In 1967, after the Six-Day War, the area fell into the hands of the Israel Defense Forces, and Moshe Dayan, the Defence Minister, who was an amateur archaeologist, attempted to regain access to the tombs. Ignorant of the serdab entrance, Dayan concentrated his attention on the shaft visible below the decorative grate and had the idea of sending someone thin enough to fit through the shaft and down into the chamber below. Dayan eventually found a slim 12-year-old girl named Michal to assist and sent her into the chamber with a camera.\nMichal explored the round chamber, but failed to find the square stone in the floor that led to the caves. Michal did, however, explore the passage and find steps leading up to the surface, though the exit was blocked by a large stone (this is the entrance near the mihrab). According to the report of her findings, which Michal gave to Dayan after having been lifted back through the shaft, there are 16 steps leading down into the passage, which is 1 cubit wide, 17.37 metres (57.0 ft) and 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) high. In the round chamber, which is 12 metres (39 ft) below the entrance to the shaft, there are three stone slabs, the middle of which contains a partial inscription of Sura 2, verse 255, from the Quran, the famous Ayatul Kursi, Verse of the Throne.\nIn 1981, Seev Jevin, the former director of the Israel Antiquities Authority, entered the passage after a group of Jewish settlers from Hebron had entered the chamber via the entrance near the mihrab and discovered the square stone in the round chamber that concealed the cave entrance. The reports state that after entering the first cave, which seemed to Jevin to be empty, he found a passage leading to a second oval chamber, smaller than the first, which contained shards of pottery and a wine jug. Findings published in the Israel Exploration Journal in 2020 stated that the pottery dated from the 8th century BCE and originated from various locations in the Hebron and Jerusalem areas.\n\nReligions beliefs and traditions\nJudaism\nAccording to the Book of Genesis, Abraham specifically purchased the land for use as a burial plot from Ephron the Hittite, making it one of two purchases by Abraham of real estate in the Land of Canaan, the Promised Land. The book describes how the three patriarchs and their wives, the matriarchs, were buried there.\n\nAbraham and Sarah (Genesis 23:1–20; Genesis 49:31)\nIsaac and Rebekah (Genesis 35:29; Genesis 49:31)\nJacob and Leah (Genesis 49:28–33; Genesis 50:4–5; Genesis 50:12–13)\nThe only matriarch missing is Jacob's other wife, Rachel, described in Genesis as having been buried near Bethlehem. These verses are the common source for the religious beliefs surrounding the cave. While they are not part of the Quran they exist in Islam's oral tradition. The story of Abraham's burial is recounted in, for example, Ibn Kathir's 14th century Stories of the Prophets.\n\nJewish midrashic literature avows that, in addition to the patriarch couples, Adam, the first man, and his wife, Eve, were also interred in the Cave of the Patriarchs, a tradition supported by ancient Samaritan texts. The tradition is supported by the simple wording of Genesis 23:2, which refers to \"Kiryat Arba... Hevron\" (\"arba\" means 'four'). Commenting on that passage, Rashi listed the four couples chronologically, starting with Adam and Eve.\nAnother Jewish tradition tells that when Jacob was brought to be buried in the cave, Esau prevented the burial, claiming that he had the right to be buried in the cave; after some negotiation Naphtali was sent to Egypt to retrieve the document stating Esau sold his part in the cave to Jacob. As this was going on, Hushim, the son of Dan, and who was hard of hearing, did not understand what was transpiring, and why his grandfather was not being buried, so he asked for an explanation; after being given one he became angry and said: \"Is my grandfather to lie there in contempt until Naphtali returns from the land of Egypt?\" He then took a club and killed Esau, and Esau's head rolled into the cave. This implies that the head of Esau is also buried in the cave. Some Jewish sources record the selling of Esau's right to be buried in the cave—according to a commentary on the \"Book of Exodus\", Jacob gave all his possessions to acquire a tomb in the Cave of the Patriarchs. He put a large pile of gold and silver before Esau and asked, \"My brother, do you prefer your portion of this cave, or all this gold and silver?\" Esau's selling to Jacob his right to be buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs is also recorded in Sefer HaYashar.\nAn early Jewish text, the Genesis Rabbah, states that this site is one of three that enemies of Judaism cannot taunt the Jews by saying \"you have stolen them,\" as it was purchased \"for its full price\" by Abraham.\nAccording to the Midrash, the Patriarchs were buried in the cave because the cave is the threshold to the Garden of Eden. The Patriarchs are said not to be dead but \"sleeping\". They rise to beg mercy for their children throughout the generations. According to the Zohar, this tomb is the gateway through which souls enter into Gan Eden (heaven).\nThere are Hebrew prayers of supplication for marriage on the walls of the Sarah cenotaph.\n\nIslam\nMuslims believe that Muhammad visited Hebron on his nocturnal journey from Mecca to Jerusalem to stop by the tomb and pay his respects. For this reason the tomb quickly became a popular Islamic pilgrimage site. It was said that Muhammad himself encouraged the activity, saying \"He who cannot visit me, let him visit the Tomb of Abraham\" and \"He who visits the Tomb of Abraham, Allah abolishes his sins.\"\nAccording to one tradition, childless women threw petitions addressed to Sarah, known for giving birth at an advanced age, through a hole in the mosque floor to the caves below.\nAfter the conquest of the city by Umar, this holy place was \"simply taken over from the Jewish tradition\" by the new rulers; the Herodian enclosure was converted into a mosque and placed under the control of a waqf. The waqf continues to maintain most of the site, while the Israeli military controls access to the site.\nAccording to some Islamic sources the cave is also the tomb of Joseph. Though the Bible has Joseph buried in Shechem (the present-day Palestinian city of Nablus), Jewish aggadic tradition conserved the idea that he wished to be interred at Hebron, and the Islamic version may reflect this. The Jewish apocryphal book, The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, also states that this is the burial place of Jacob's twelve sons.\nAccording to some sources, the mosque is the 4th holiest in Islam; other sources rank other sites as 4th.\nA Fatimid-era minbar is kept at the mosque. According to an Arabic inscription written on the minbar, it was commissioned by Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali during the reign of Caliph al-Mustansir when he discovered the head of Husayn ibn Ali in 1092 CE (448 AH) at Ascalon and kept it at a mosque and shrine there.\n\nSee also\nIslam in Palestine\nJudaism in Palestine\nChristianity in Palestine\nList of mosques in Palestine\nList of burial places of founders of religious traditions\nList of World Heritage Sites in the State of Palestine\nThe Cave – a 1993 multimedia opera set in the cave\nTomb of the Matriarchs\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nConder, J.

          "summary": "The Cave of the Patriarchs or Tomb of the Patriarchs, known to Jews by its Biblical name Cave of Machpelah (Biblical Hebrew: מְעָרַת הַמַּכְפֵּלָה, romanized: , lit. 'Cave of the Double') and to Muslims as the Ibrahami Mosque (Arabic: المسجد الإبراهيمي, romanized: al-Masjid al-ʾibrāhīmī), or Sanctuary of Ibrahim (Arabic: الحرم الإبراهيمي, romanized: ), is a series of caves situated in the heart of the Old City of Hebron in the West Bank, 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of Jerusalem. According to the Abrahamic religions, the cave and adjoining field were purchased by Abraham as a burial plot, although most historians believe the Abraham-Isaac-Jacob narrative to be primarily mythological. The site is considered a holy place in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\nOver the cave stands a large rectangular enclosure dating from the Herodian era. During Byzantine rule of the region, a Christian basilica was built on the site; the structure was converted into the Ibrahimi Mosque following the Muslim conquest of the Levant. By the 12th century, the mosque and its surrounding regions had fallen under Crusader-state control, but were retaken in 1188 by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin, who again converted the structure into a mosque. In 1119 CE, a monk found bones inside the cave, believing them to be the bones of the patriarchs. \nDuring the Six-Day War of 1967, the entire Jordanian-ruled West Bank was seized and occupied by the State of Israel, after which the mosque was divided, with half of it repurposed as a synagogue. In 1968, special Jewish services were authorized outside the usual permitted hours on the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement, leading to a hand-grenade attack on 9 October which injured 47 Israelis; and a second bombing on 4 November, which wounded 6 people. In 1972, the Israeli government increased the Jewish prayer area. New changes to the \"status quo\" were made by Israeli authorities in 1975, which again led to protests by Muslims. \nIn 1976, a scuffle took place between Jewish and Muslim worshippers, during which a Quran was torn. Muslim and Arab figures went to Hebron the next day to protest what was called a \"profanation of the Quran\". The Tomb was closed and a curfew was imposed on the whole city. A few days later, about two hundred Arab youths entered the Tomb and destroyed Torah scrolls and prayer books. In May 1980, an attack on Jewish worshippers returning from prayers at the tomb left 6 dead and 17 wounded. In 1994, the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre occurred at the Ibrahimi Mosque, in which an armed Israeli settler entered the complex during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and opened fire on Palestinian Muslims who had gathered to pray at the site, killing 29 people, including children, and wounding over 125.",

          "content": "The Church of the Nativity, or Basilica of the Nativity, is a basilica located in Bethlehem, West Bank, Palestine. The grotto holds a prominent religious significance to Christians of various denominations as the birthplace of Jesus. The grotto is the oldest site continuously used as a place of worship in Christianity, and the basilica is the oldest major church in the Holy Land.\nThe church was originally commissioned by Constantine the Great a short time after his mother Helena's visit to Jerusalem and Bethlehem in 325–326, on the site that was traditionally considered to be the birthplace of Jesus. That original basilica was likely built between 330 and 333, being already mentioned in 333, and was dedicated on 31 May 339. It was probably destroyed by fire during the Samaritan revolts of the sixth century, possibly in 529, and a new basilica was built a number of years later by Byzantine Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), who added a porch or narthex, and replaced the octagonal sanctuary with a cruciform transept complete with three apses, but largely preserved the original character of the building, with an atrium and a basilica consisting of a nave with four side aisles.\nThe Church of the Nativity, while remaining basically unchanged since the Justinianic reconstruction, has seen numerous repairs and additions, especially from the Crusader period, such as two bell towers (now gone), wall mosaics and paintings (partially preserved). Over the centuries, the surrounding compound has been expanded, and today it covers approximately 12,000 square meters, comprising three different monasteries: one Catholic, one Armenian Apostolic, and one Greek Orthodox, of which the first two contain bell towers built during the modern era.\nThe silver star marking the spot where Christ was born, inscribed in Latin, was stolen in October 1847 by Greek monks who wished to remove this Catholic item. Some assert that this was a contributing factor in the Crimean War against the Russian Empire. Others assert that the war grew out of the wider European situation.\nSince 2012, the Church of the Nativity is a World Heritage Site and was the first to be listed by UNESCO under 'Palestine'.\nSince 1852, the rights of the three religious communities have been governed by an understanding known as the Status Quo. Initially informal, this was made official by the Treaty of Paris in 1856, and was codified by the United Nations in the Palestine Conciliation Commission in 1949.\n\nBase in scripture\nOf the four canonical gospels, Matthew and Luke mention the birth of Jesus, both placing it in Bethlehem. Luke mentions the manger: \"and she gave birth to her son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.\"\nA variant of the narrative is contained in the Gospel of James, an apocryphal infancy gospel.\n\nHistory\nHoly site before Constantine (ca. 4 BC–AD 326)\nThe holy site known as the Nativity Grotto is thought to be the manger where Jesus was born. In 135, Emperor Hadrian had the site above the grotto converted into a worship place for Adonis, the mortal lover of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of beauty and desire. Jerome claimed in 420 that the grotto had been consecrated to the worship of Adonis, and that a sacred grove was planted there in order to completely wipe out the memory of Jesus from the world.\nAround AD 248, Greek philosopher Origen of Alexandria wrote the following about the grotto:\n\nIn Bethlehem the cave is pointed out where He was born, and the manger in the cave where He was wrapped in swaddling clothes. And the rumor is in those places, and among foreigners of the Faith, that indeed Jesus was born in this cave who is worshiped and reverenced by the Christians.\n\nConstantinian basilica (326 – 529 or 556)\nThe first basilica on this site was built by Emperor Constantine I, on the site identified by his mother, Empress Helena and Bishop Makarios of Jerusalem. The construction started in 326 under the supervision of Makarios, who followed Constantine's orders, and was dedicated on 31 May 339—however, it had already been visited in 333 by the Bordeaux Pilgrim, at which time it was already in use.\nConstruction of this early church was carried out as part of a larger project following the First Council of Nicaea during Constantine's reign, aimed to build churches on the sites assumed at the time to have witnessed the crucial events in the life of Jesus. The design of the basilica centered around three major architectural sections:\n\nAt the eastern end, an apse in a polygonal shape (broken pentagon, rather than the once proposed, but improbable full octagon), encircling a raised platform with an opening in its floor of ca. 4 metres diameter that allowed direct view of the Nativity site underneath. An ambulatory with side rooms surrounded the apse.\nA five-aisled basilica in continuation of the eastern apse, one bay shorter than the still standing Justinianic reconstruction.\nA porticoed atrium.\nThe structure was burned and destroyed in one of the Samaritan Revolts of 529 or 556, in the second of which Jews seem to have joined the Samaritans.\n\nJustinian's basilica (6th century)\nThe basilica was rebuilt in its present form in the 6th century on the initiative of Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (527–565), after the destruction of either 529 or 556. It was probably accomplished after the Emperor's death, as is indicated by the dating of the wooden elements embedded in the church walls between 545 and 665, which was provided by the dendrochronological analyses made during the recent restoration works.\nThe Persians under Khosrau II invaded Palestine and conquered nearby Jerusalem in 614, but they did not destroy the structure. According to legend, their commander Shahrbaraz was moved by the depiction above the church entrance of the Three Magi wearing the garb of Persian Zoroastrian priests, so he ordered that the building be spared.\n\nCrusader period (1099–1187)\nThe First Crusade captured Jerusalem in 1099. The Latin conquerors promoted the redecoration of the building in the medium of wall painting: images of saints were displayed in the central and southern colonnades of the nave, largely on the initiative of private donors, as is shown by the frequent use of dedicatory inscriptions and portraits. Remnants of a cycle of narrative scenes are preserved in the north-western pillar of the choir and the south transepts, as well as in the chapel located below the bell tower.\nFrom 1131 until the end of the Latin rule over Jerusalem, the Holy Sepulchre was the site of royal coronations and burials. The Latins undertook extensive decoration and restoration on the basilica and grounds, a process that continued until 1169, from 1165 to 1169 even through a sort of \"joint venture\" between Bishop Ralph and King Amalric and the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos. As detailed in the bilingual Greek and Latin inscription in the altar space, the mosaic decoration was made by a teamwork headed by a painter named Ephraim. Another bilingual, Latin and Syriac, inscription located in the lower half of a mosaic panel displaying an angel in the northern wall of the nave bears witness to the work of a painter named Basil, who was probably a local Syrian Melkite. The two artists collaborated within the same workshop.\n\nAyyubid and Mamluk periods (1187–1516)\nThe Ayyubid conquest of Jerusalem and its area in 1187 was without consequences for the Nativity church. The Greek-Melkite clergy was granted the right to serve in the church, and similar concessions were given almost immediately also to other Christian denominations.\nIn the year 1227 the church was embellished with an elegantly carved wooden door, the remnants of which can still be seen in the narthex. As detailed in its double, Armenian and Arabic inscription, it was made by two Armenian monks, Father Abraham and Father Arakel, in the times of King Hethum I of Cilicia (1224–1269) and the Emir of Damascus, and Saladin's nephew, al-Mu'azzam Isa.\nIn 1229 Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II signed an agreement with Sultan al-Kamil which led to the restitution of the Holy Places to the Crusaders. The property of the Nativity Church came back into the possession of the Latin clergy on the condition that Muslim pilgrims may be allowed to visit the holy cave.\nLatin hegemony probably lasted until the incursion of Khwarezmian Turks in April 1244. On that occasion, the church treasures, now preserved in the Terra Sancta Museum in Jerusalem, were concealed underground and rediscovered only in 1863. The church was devastated, but not destroyed, the major damage being the dilapidation of its roof.\nUnder Mamluk rule, the church was used by different Christian denominations, including Greeks, Armenians, Copts, Ethiopians, and Syrians. In 1347 the Franciscans of the newly established Custody of the Holy Land were bestowed with the ownership of the former monastery of the regular canons to the north of the basilica. The Friars managed to gain a hegemonic role in Bethlehem until the Ottoman period.\nStarting from the late 13th century, pilgrims lament the dilapidation of the church interior by order of Mamluk authorities: in particular, the marble revetments of the walls and floor were gradually removed, until they thoroughly disappeared.\nThe Duchy of Burgundy committed resources to restore the roof in August 1448, and multiple regions contributed supplies to have the church roof repaired in 1480: England supplied the lead, the Second Kingdom of Burgundy supplied the wood, and the Republic of Venice provided the labor.\n\nOttoman period, first three centuries (16th–18th)\nAfter the Ottoman conquest of Palestine in 1516, the Nativity church suffered from a long decay. The nave was largely abandoned and used for profane purposes. In the aim to prevent people from entering the church with horses and cattle, the main entrance was walled up and transformed into a diminutive door, known until our days as the \"Door of Humility\", since visitors are forced to bend down to go through it. An elevated chancel, provided with three doors, thoroughly separated the nave from the east end of the building, which was reserved for liturgical activities.\nThe Ottoman period was characterized by increasing tensions between the different Christian denominations. In 1637, Greeks were granted hegemony by the Sublime Porte and the Franciscans were expelled from the holy cave. In 1621 the Armenian Patriarch Grigor Paronter bought the partly ruined buildings to the south of the courtyard and established there a monastery and a hospice for pilgrims. In 1639, the Cretan painter Jeremias Palladas was commissioned by the Greek Patriarch to paint new icons to embellish the church. Further works were made in 1671 on the initiative of Patriarch Dositheos II. In 1675, Dositheos managed to gain control also of the nave, and promoted restorations of the floor and the roof, as well as the making of a new iconostasis. The Franciscans were restored in their rights in 1690, but they lose their hegemony once again in 1757, when the Greek Orthodox were granted full ownership of the upper church and the authorization to keep the keys to the grotto. Afterwards, a redecoration of the church was promoted: the nave was newly paved, the bema was provided with a solemn iconostasis and a wooden baldachin was erected over the main altar.\nBecause of uninterrupted water infiltrations from the roof, the Crusader mosaics started falling down, as is documented in many pilgrims' accounts from the 16th century onwards.\n\nNineteenth century\nEarthquakes inflicted significant damage to the Church of the Nativity between 1834 and 1837. The 1834 Jerusalem earthquake damaged the church's bell tower, the furnishings in the cave on which the church is built, and other parts of its structure. Minor damages were further inflicted by a series of strong aftershocks in 1836 and the Galilee earthquake of 1837. As part of the repairs executed by the Greek Orthodox after receiving a firman in 1842, a wall was built between the nave and aisles, used at the time as a market, and the eastern part of the church containing the choir, which allowed for worship to be continued there.\nThe religiously significant silver star marking the exact birthplace of Jesus was removed in October 1847 from the Grotto of the Nativity by the Greek Orthodox. The church was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, but around Christmas 1852, Napoleon III forced the Ottomans to recognise Catholic France as the \"sovereign authority\" over Christian holy sites in the Holy Land. The Sultan of Turkey replaced the silver star at the grotto, complete with a Latin inscription, but the Christian Orthodox Russian Empire disputed the change in authority. They cited the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca and then deployed armies to the Danube area. As a result, the Ottomans issued firmans essentially reversing their earlier decision, renouncing the French treaty, and restoring to the Orthodox Christians the sovereign authority over the churches of the Holy Land for the time being, thus increasing local tensions—and all this fuelled the conflict between the Russian and the Ottoman empires over the control of holy sites around the region.\n\nTwentieth century to the present\nIn 1918 British governor Colonel Ronald Storrs demolished the wall erected in 1842 by the Greek Orthodox between nave and choir.\nThe passageway which connects St. Jerome's Cave and the Cave of the Nativity was expanded in February 1964, allowing easier access for visitors. American businessman Stanley Slotkin was visiting at the time and purchased a quantity of the limestone rubble, more than a million irregular fragments about 5 mm (0.20 in) across. He sold them to the public encased in plastic crosses, and they were advertised in infomercials in 1995.\nDuring the Second Intifada in April 2002, the church was the site of a month-long siege in which approximately 50 armed Palestinians wanted by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) took refuge inside the church. Christians in the church gave refuge to the fighters, giving them food, water, and protection from Israeli military forces stationed outside. Israeli media claimed that the Christians inside were being held hostage, however, parishioners inside the church say they and the church were treated with respect.\nCurtains caught fire in the grotto beneath the church on 27 May 2014, which resulted in some slight damage.\nThe church's joint owners undertook a major renovation starting in September 2013, probably to be completed in 2021 (see also under Restoration (2013–2019)).\n\nWorld Heritage Site\nIn 2012, the church complex became the first Palestinian site to be listed as a World Heritage Site by the World Heritage Committee at its 36th session on 29 June. It was approved by a secret vote of 13–6 in the 21-member committee, according to UNESCO spokeswoman Sue Williams, and following an emergency candidacy procedure that by-passed the 18-month process for most sites, despite the opposition of the United States and Israel. The site was approved under criteria four and six. The decision was a controversial one on both technical and political terms. It was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger from 2012 to 2019, as it was suffering from damages due to water leaks.\n\nRestoration (2013–2019)\nEndangered status\nThe basilica was placed on the 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the World Monuments Fund:\n\nThe present state of the church is worrying. Many roof timbers are rotting, and have not been replaced since the 19th century. The rainwater that seeps into the building not only accelerates the rotting of the wood and damages the structural integrity of the building, but also damages the 12th-century wall mosaics and paintings. The influx of water also means that there is an ever-present chance of an electrical fire. If another earthquake were to occur on the scale of the one of 1834, the result would most likely be catastrophic. ... It is hoped that the listing will encourage its preservation, including getting the three custodians of the church—the Greek Orthodox Church, the Armenian Orthodox Church, and the Franciscan order—to work together, which has not happened for hundreds of years. The Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority would also have to work together to protect it.\nA Presidential committee for the restoration of the Nativity Church was appointed in 2008. In the following year, an international consortium team of experts from different Universities, under the supervision of Prof. Claudio Alessandri (University of Ferrara, Italy), was given the task of planning and coordinating the restoration works.\n\nLogistics and organisation\nIn 2010, the Palestinian Authority announced that a multimillion-dollar restoration programme was imminent. Although a majority Muslim nation, albeit with a significant Christian minority, Palestinians consider the church a national treasure and one of their most visited tourist sites. President Mahmoud Abbas has been actively involved in the project, which is led by Ziad al-Bandak. The project is partially funded by Palestinians and conducted by a team of Palestinian and international experts.\n\nRestoration process\nThe initial phase of the restoration work was completed in early 2016. New windows have been installed, structural repairs on the roof have been completed and art works and mosaics have been cleaned and restored. The works went further with the consolidation of the narthex, the cleaning and consolidation of all wooden elements, the cleaning of wall mosaics, mural paintings, and floor mosaics. The works came to pause in 2021; however there is still restoration work to be done as of June 2024. The remaining goals of the project include: the conservation of the stone tiles of the Church of the Nativity’s front yard, the addition of a firefighting system, a climate control system, structural consolidation, further prevention of seismic activity damage, and the restoration of the central nave. The most necessary of the repairs yet to be done is restoration of the Grotto of the Nativity.\n\nDiscoveries\nItalian restoration workers uncovered a seventh surviving mosaic angel in July 2016, which was previously hidden under plaster. According to the Italian restorer Marcello Piacenti, the mosaics \"are made of gold leaf placed between two glass plates\" and solely \"faces and limbs are drawn with small pieces of stone.\"\n\nProperty and administration\nThe property rights, liturgical use and maintenance of the church are regulated by a set of documents and understandings known as the Status Quo. The church is owned by three church authorities, the Greek Orthodox (most of the building and furnishings), the Catholic and the Armenian Apostolic (each of them with lesser properties). The Coptic Orthodox and Syriac Orthodox are holding minor rights of worship at the Armenian church in the northern transept, and at the Altar of Nativity.\nThere have been repeated brawls among monk trainees over quiet respect for others' prayers, hymns and even the division of floor space for cleaning duties. The Palestinian police are often called to restore peace and order.\n\nSite architecture and layout\nThe centrepiece of the Nativity complex is the Grotto of the Nativity, a cave which enshrines the site where Jesus is said to have been born.\nThe core of the complex connected to the Grotto consists of the Church of the Nativity itself, and the adjoining Catholic Church of St. Catherine north of it.\n\nOuter courtyard\nBethlehem's main city square, Manger Square, is an extension of the large paved courtyard in front of the Church of the Nativity and St Catherine's. Here crowds gather on Christmas Eve to sing Christmas carols in anticipation of the midnight services.\n\nBasilica of the Nativity\nThe main Basilica of the Nativity is maintained by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem. It is designed like a typical Roman basilica, with five aisles formed by Corinthian columns, and an apse in the eastern end containing the sanctuary.\nThe basilica is entered through a very low door called the \"Door of Humility.\"\nThe church's interior walls feature medieval golden mosaics once covering the side walls, which are now in large parts lost.\nThe original Roman-style floor of the basilica has been covered over with flagstones, but there is a trap door in the floor which opens up to reveal a portion of the original mosaic pavement from the Constantinian basilica.\nThere are 44 columns separating the aisles from each other and from the nave, some of which are painted with images of saints, such as the Irish monk Catald (fl. 7th century), the patron of the Sicilian Normans, Canute IV (c. 1042–1086), king of Denmark, and Olaf II (995–1030), king of Norway.\nThe east end of the church consists of a raised chancel, closed by an apse containing the main altar and separated from the chancel by a large gilded iconostasis.\nA complex array of sanctuary lamps is placed throughout the entire building.\nThe open ceiling exposes the wooden rafters, recently restored. The previous 15th-century restoration used beams donated by King Edward IV of England, who also donated lead to cover the roof; however, this lead was taken by the Ottoman Turks, who melted it down for ammunition to use in war against Venice.\nStairways on either side of the chancel lead down to the Grotto.\n\nGrotto of the Nativity\nThe Grotto of the Nativity, the place where Jesus is said to have been born, is an underground space which forms the crypt of the Church of the Nativity. It is situated underneath its main altar, and it is normally accessed by two staircases on either side of the chancel. The grotto is part of a network of caves, which are accessed from the adjacent Church St Catherine's. The tunnel-like corridor connecting the Grotto to the other caves is normally locked.\nThe cave has an eastern niche said to be the place where Jesus was born, which contains the Altar of Nativity. The exact spot where Jesus was born is marked beneath this altar by a 14-pointed silver star with the Latin inscription Hic De Virgine Maria Jesus Christus Natus Est-1717 (\"Here Jesus Christ was born to the Virgin Mary-1717\"). It was installed by the Catholics in 1717, removed – allegedly by the Greeks – in 1847, and replaced by the Turkish government in 1853. The star is set into the marble floor and surrounded by 15 silver lamps representing the three Christian communities: six belong to the Greek Orthodox, four to the Catholics, and five to the Armenian Apostolic. The Altar of the Nativity is maintained by the Greek Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic churches. The significance of the 14 points on the star is to represent the three sets of 14 generations in the genealogy of Jesus Christ. First 14 from Abraham to David, then 14 from David to the Babylonian captivity, then 14 more to Jesus Christ. In the middle of the 14 pointed star is a circular hole, through which one can reach in to touch the stone that is said to be the original stone that Mary lay on when she gave birth to Jesus. On the apse above the altar was a 12th-century mosaic depicting the Nativity; the base of the mosaic read \"Gloria in excelsis Deo et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis\" (\"Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men of good will\"). The mosaic was vandalized in 1873 by Greeks who rioted against the Franciscans. Fragments of the mosaic can still be seen on the apse but are covered over by an icon during liturgical celebrations by the Greeks and Armenians.\nCatholics are in charge of a section of the grotto known as the \"Grotto of the Manger\", marking the traditional site where Mary laid the newborn baby in the manger. The Altar of the Magi is located directly opposite from the manger site. The Franciscans are also in charge of a door, at the opposite end of the Altar of the Nativity, that opens to a passageway connecting the grotto with the underground chapels of Saint Catherine Church.\n\nChurch of St. Catherine\nThe adjoining Church of St. Catherine is a Catholic church dedicated to Catherine of Alexandria, built in a more modern Gothic Revival style. It has been further modernized according to the liturgical trends which followed Vatican II.\nThis is the church where the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem celebrates Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. Certain customs in this Midnight Mass predate Vatican II, but must be maintained because the Status Quo was legally fixed by a Firman (decree) in 1852 under the Ottoman Empire, which is still in force today.\nThe bas-relief of the Tree of Jesse is a 3.75 by 4 metres (12 ft 4 in by 13 ft 1 in) sculpture by Czesław Dźwigaj which was recently incorporated into the Church of St. Catherine as a gift of Pope Benedict XVI during his trip to the Holy Land in 2009. It represents an olive tree as the Tree of Jesse, displaying the genealogy of Jesus from Abraham through Joseph, as well as symbolism from the Old Testament. The upper portion is dominated by a crowned figure of Christ the King in an open-armed pose blessing the Earth. It is situated along the passage used by pilgrims making their way to the Grotto of the Nativity.\n\nCaves accessed from St. Catherine's\nSeveral chapels are found in the caves accessed from St. Catherine's, including the Chapel of Saint Joseph commemorating the angel's appearance to Joseph, commanding him to flee to Egypt; the Chapel of the Innocents, commemorating the children killed by Herod; and the Chapel of Saint Jerome, in the underground cell where tradition holds he lived while translating the Bible into Latin (the Vulgate).\n\nTombs\nTraditional tombs of saints\nAccording to a tradition not sustained by history, the tombs of four Catholic saints are said to be located beneath the Church of the Nativity, in the caves accessible from the Church of St. Catherine:\n\nJerome, whose remains are said to have been transferred to the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome\nPaula, a disciple and benefactor of Jerome\nEustochium, the daughter of Paula\nEusebius of Cremona, a disciple of Jerome. A different tradition holds that he is buried in Italy.\n\nAncient burials\nA number of ancient trough-shaped tombs can be seen in the Catholic-owned caves adjacent to the Nativity Grotto and St Jerome's Cave, some of them inside the Chapel of the Innocents; more tombs can be seen on the southern, Greek-Orthodox side of the Basilica of the Nativity, also presented as being those of the infants murdered by Herod.\nAccording to researcher Haytham Dieck, rock-cut tombs and bone fragments in one restricted room of the church date from the 1st century AD. In another clandestine chamber, the Cave of the Holy Innocents, skulls and other bones from as many as 2,000 people (according to Dieck) are collected, but are clearly not infantile.\n\nChristmas in Bethlehem\nThere are three different dates for the celebration of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in Bethlehem:\n\n24 and 25 December for the Catholics (Latins), who use the General Roman Calendar (Gregorian);\n6 and 7 January for the Greek Orthodox, together with the Syriac Orthodox, Ethiopian and Coptic Orthodox, who use the Julian calendar;\n18 and 19 January for the Armenian Apostolic Church, which combines the celebration of the Nativity with that of the Baptism of Jesus into the Armenian Feast of Theophany on 6 January, according to the early traditions of Eastern Christianity, but follows the rules of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem in its calculations (6 January Julian style corresponds to 19 January Gregorian style).\n\nLatin and Protestant\nThe Catholic Midnight Mass in Bethlehem on Christmas Eve is broadcast around the world. Festivities begin hours earlier when dignitaries welcome the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem at the entrance to the city, near Rachel's Tomb. Accompanied by a parade of youth organizations, he then makes his way to Manger Square, where crowds are waiting. Finally, he enters the Catholic Church of Saint Catherine for Mass, after which he leads the way to the adjacent Church of the Nativity. The patriarch carries a figurine of the Baby Jesus and places it on the silver star in the Nativity Grotto under the basilica.\nProtestants worship either at the Lutheran church or the Church of the Nativity. However, some Protestant congregations go to Beit Sahour, a village near Bethlehem.\n\nGreek Orthodox\nOn the Orthodox Christmas Eve, 13 days later, many visitors and faithful again fill Manger Square, this time to watch processions and receptions for the religious leaders of the different Eastern Orthodox communities.\n\nArmenian\nMembers of the Armenian community are the last ones to celebrate Christmas, on 18 and 19 January, in their own section of the Nativity Church. The altars there are also used by the smaller denominations during their respective Christmas festivities.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nNativity of Jesus\nNativity scene\nEarly Christian art and architecture\nList of oldest church buildings\nPalestinian Christians\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nHugues Vincent and Félix-Marie Abel, Bethléem.

          "summary": "The Church of the Nativity, or Basilica of the Nativity, is a basilica located in Bethlehem, West Bank, Palestine. The grotto holds a prominent religious significance to Christians of various denominations as the birthplace of Jesus. The grotto is the oldest site continuously used as a place of worship in Christianity, and the basilica is the oldest major church in the Holy Land.\nThe church was originally commissioned by Constantine the Great a short time after his mother Helena's visit to Jerusalem and Bethlehem in 325–326, on the site that was traditionally considered to be the birthplace of Jesus. That original basilica was likely built between 330 and 333, being already mentioned in 333, and was dedicated on 31 May 339. It was probably destroyed by fire during the Samaritan revolts of the sixth century, possibly in 529, and a new basilica was built a number of years later by Byzantine Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), who added a porch or narthex, and replaced the octagonal sanctuary with a cruciform transept complete with three apses, but largely preserved the original character of the building, with an atrium and a basilica consisting of a nave with four side aisles.\nThe Church of the Nativity, while remaining basically unchanged since the Justinianic reconstruction, has seen numerous repairs and additions, especially from the Crusader period, such as two bell towers (now gone), wall mosaics and paintings (partially preserved). Over the centuries, the surrounding compound has been expanded, and today it covers approximately 12,000 square meters, comprising three different monasteries: one Catholic, one Armenian Apostolic, and one Greek Orthodox, of which the first two contain bell towers built during the modern era.\nThe silver star marking the spot where Christ was born, inscribed in Latin, was stolen in October 1847 by Greek monks who wished to remove this Catholic item. Some assert that this was a contributing factor in the Crimean War against the Russian Empire. Others assert that the war grew out of the wider European situation.\nSince 2012, the Church of the Nativity is a World Heritage Site and was the first to be listed by UNESCO under 'Palestine'.\nSince 1852, the rights of the three religious communities have been governed by an understanding known as the Status Quo. Initially informal, this was made official by the Treaty of Paris in 1856, and was codified by the United Nations in the Palestine Conciliation Commission in 1949.",

          "content": "Hisham's Palace (Arabic: قصر هشام Qaṣr Hishām), also known as Khirbat al-Mafjar (Arabic: خربة المفجر), is an important early Islamic archaeological site in the city of Jericho, in the West Bank in Palestine. Built by the Umayyad dynasty in the first half of the 8th century, it is one of the so-called Umayyad desert castles. It is located 3 kilometres (2 mi) north of Jericho's city center, in an area governed by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). The palace was used until the 11th century, and it may have been destroyed by an earthquake in 1033.\nSpreading over 60 hectares (150 acres), the site consists of three main parts: a palace, an ornate bath complex, and an agricultural estate. The entire complex – palace, baths, and farm – was connected to nearby springs by an elaborate water system. The site is on the tentative list of World Heritage Sites and has been open to the public since 2021.\n\nLocation\nHisham's Palace was established north of Jericho's urban centre. It was separated from Jericho by the Wadi Nueima. The archaeologist Michael Jennings suggests that the separation provided protection as Jericho was at the time a mostly Christian settlement. Its position that meant accessing the main water source in the area, the Ayn al-Sultan spring, was impractical. Instead, the palace drew its water from springs at Naaran to the north-west. Aqueducts were built to transport water from the springs to the palace. The palace was immediately east of a road running north from Jericho, through the Jordan Valley, and connecting to Damascus.\n\nHistory\nIt is difficult to establish a secure historical framework for Hisham's Palace. No textual sources reference the site, and archaeological excavations are the only source of further information. An ostracon bearing the name \"Hisham\" was found during the course of Baramki's excavations. This was interpreted as evidence that the site was built during the reign of the caliph Hishām ibn ʿAbd al-Malik. Robert Hamilton subsequently argued that the palace was a residence of al-Walid ibn Yazid, a nephew of Hisham who was famous for his extravagant lifestyle. Archaeologically it is certain that the site is a product of the Umayyad dynasty in the first half of the 8th century, although the specifics of its patronage and use remain unknown.\n\nHisham's Palace belongs to the category of desert castles, a collection of monuments dating to the Umayyad dynasty and found throughout Syria, Jordan, Israel, and Palestine. Although there is great variation in the size, location, and presumed function of these different sites, they can be connected to the patronage of different figures in the Umayyad ruling family. Though it has been described as one of the Umayyad desert castles, Hisham's Palace is located in a fertile area. Consequently, it has become more common to refer to it as a qasr (plural: qusur), an Arabic word roughly translating to \"palace\". As a category of building, the Umayyad qusur had several typical characteristics. The main structure was usually two-storeys tall and consisted of ranges of buildings arranged around a courtyard. Other buildings were often found nearby, creating a complex of related structures. This could include a bath building, a mosque, outlying residential buildings, and a large walled enclosure called a hayr that extended east beyond the buildings.\nThe site is commonly thought to have been destroyed during the earthquake of 749 and then abandoned, but an analysis of Baramki's detailed reporting shows that this is incorrect. Instead the ceramic record indicates that the occupation continued through the Ayyubid-Mamluk period, with a significant phase of occupation between 900 and 1000 during the Abbasid and Fatimid periods. A 2013 geological investigation of the site suggest the palace was destroyed by the later earthquake of 1033. Evidence of faulting and damage corresponded to a more severe earthquake than that of 749.\n\nExcavation history\nThe site was discovered in 1873. The northern area of the site was noted, but not excavated, in 1894 by F. J. Bliss. Palestinian archaeologist Dimitri Baramki carried out major excavations at the palace between 1935 and 1948. In 1959 Baramki's colleague, colonial administrator for the British Mandate government Robert Hamilton, published the major work on Hisham's Palace, Khirbat al-Mafjar: An Arabian Mansion in the Jordanian Valley. Unfortunately, Baramki's archaeological research is absent from this volume, so Hamilton's analysis is exclusively art historical. Baramki's research on the archaeological aspects of the site, particularly the ceramics, was published in various preliminary reports and articles in the Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine. When Hisham's Palace was discovered there were few similar sites known which could aid interpretation. Since then nearly 40 Umayyad qusur have been identified. Many of the finds from Baramki and Hamilton's excavations are now held in the Rockefeller Archeological Museum in East Jerusalem.\n\nFollowing the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the West Bank was annexed by the Kingdom of Jordan. This meant that archaeological sites in the area came under the administration of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan. Baramki was offered the position of director with authority over sites in the West Bank, but he decided to work at the Palestine Archaeological Museum instead. Awni Dajani was appointed to the role; Dajani's family owned the land where Hisham's Palace had been discovered and he began new excavations there in 1957 and continued into the 1960s. Dajani dug to the north of the bathhouse; the results were only partially published and the first plan of the excavated area was created decades after Dajani's investigations.\nAcross 1994 and 1995, control of archaeological sites in Areas A and B of the West Bank was transferred to the Department of Antiquities of the newly formed Palestinian National Authority. The department initiated international partnerships to address a skills gap resulting from Palestinians being excluded from archaeological investigations in Palestine under occupation. One such project was the conservation of Hisham's Palace. The work led by the department began at the palace in 1996 with funding from the Italian government and the involvement of UNESCO and the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum.\nIn 2006, new excavations were initiated under Hamdan Taha of the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. The Jericho Mafjar Project investigating the site was a collaboration between the ministry and archaeologists from the University of Chicago.\nBetween 2009 and 2014 Mahmoud Hawari led investigations of the landscape around the palace to better understand how Hisham's Palace was connected to its hinterland. In 2015, an agreement was signed between the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities and the Japan International Cooperation Agency to enable the 825 square metres (8,880 sq ft) mosaic in the palace, one of the largest in the world, to be uncovered and readied for display.\n\nArchitecture\nThe palace, bath complex, and external mosque are enclosed by a retaining wall. The southern gate was known from Baramki's excavations, but the 21st-century discovery of a northern gate in alignment indicates that the development of Hisham's Palace was conceived of as a complete unit to be constructed at once.\n\nPalace\nThe largest building at the site is the palace, a roughly square building with round towers at the corners. It originally had two stories. Entrance was through a gate on the center of the east side. The inner rooms were aligned around a central paved portico (riwaq), which featured an underground cellar (sirdab); for refuge from the heat. The room to the south of the portico was a mosque with a mihrab built into the outer wall.\n\nOuter pavilion and mosque\nIn the courtyard east of the palace-and-baths complex was a pavilion containing a monumental fountain. A second, larger mosque was located inside the complex, north of the palace gateway.\n\nBath complex\nThe bath complex is located just north of the palace across an open area. This free-standing structure is almost 30 meters square, more precisely 827 square metres (8,900 sq ft), and three of its sides feature semi-circular exedrae which project out from the building, three each to the south and west, and two to the east. The east face of the bath had an ornate entrance in its center, flanked by exedrae. Along much of the southern side of the main, square hall is a pool. The  interior floor surface of the bath complex was paved with mosaic decoration. A special reception room, or diwan, was entered from the northwest corner. The floor of this room is paved with the famous \"tree of life\" mosaic, depicting a lion and gazelles at the foot of a tree.\nThe actual bathing rooms were attached to the northern wall of the complex, and were heated from below the floor by hypocausts.\n\nAgricultural annex\nTo the north of the bath complex are the ruins of a large square structure which has clearly gone through many phases of reuse and reconstruction. This part of the site was initially assumed to be a khan or caravanserai, but recent excavations have indicated that the northern area had an agricultural function connected to the hayr or agricultural enclosure during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods.\n\nPhoto gallery\nDecorative elements\nThe decorative elements at Hisham's Palace are some of the finest representations of Umayyad period art and are well documented in the publications of Robert Hamilton.\n\nMosaics\nThe floor of the main bathing hall is covered with colorful geometric mosaics, at the center of which is a large kaleidoscope design. The enormous mosaic is divided into 25 square bays that are separated by pier clusters. A large variety of geometric designs cover the floor, which are rarely repeated. The colors used are primarily blue, red, green, yellow, and orange. After years of restoration funded by Japan, the mosaic covering 836 square metres (9,000 sq ft), one of the largest floor mosaics in the world, with more than five million distinctive pieces of stone from Palestine, was unveiled in October 2021. This floor mosaic is one of the largest that has survived from the ancient world.\n\nThe most famous mosaic at the site is the \"Tree of Life\" mosaic in the diwan, or the private audience room, located in the northwestern corner of the main bathing hall. The pavement mosaic depicts a fruiting tree with two unknowing gazelles on the left side and a lion attacking another gazelle on the right side. It is a popular design throughout Islamic history in places like Northern Syria and Transjordan, and has been a popular topic of conversation as there are numerous theories related to its meaning. One idea is that the mosaic represents the peace that the caliph brought with his military prowess. Another idea stems from the border of the mosaic, which resembles the tassels of a curtain or drape. During the Umayyad, Abbasid, and Fatimid periods, court accounts recall that the caliphs sat behind curtains from where they appeared at specified moments in various rituals. The tassels that border the \"Tree of Life\" mosaic may suggest that the scene of the lion and gazelles should be understood through a lens of intimacy.\nAll of the mosaics found at Hisham's Palace are of very high quality and feature a wide variety of colors and figural motifs.\n\nCarved stucco\nThe carved stucco found at the site is also of exceptional quality. Of particular note is the statue depicting a male figure with a sword, often presumed to be the caliph, which stood in a niche above the entrance to the bath hall. Additional male and female figures carved in stucco, some semi-nude, adorn the bath complex. Geometric and vegetal patterns are also quite common.\nWhile Hamilton described the carvings at Hisham's Palace as amateurish and chaotic, many subsequent art historians have noted similarities with Iranian themes. Hana Taragan has argued that the artistic themes seen at the site are Levantine examples of an Islamic visual language of power that coalesced from Sasanian influences in Iraq. Priscilla Soucek has also drawn attention to the site's representation of the Islamic myth of Solomon.\n\nPhoto gallery\nConservation\nAccording to the Global Heritage Fund (GHF), the rapid urban development of Jericho, as well as expansion of agricultural activity in the area, are limiting archaeologists' access to the site, much of which remain unexplored. Conservation efforts aimed at protecting important structures have been hindered by lack of resources. In a 2010 report titled Saving Our Vanishing Heritage, GHF identified Hisham's Palace as one of 12 worldwide heritage sites most \"On the Verge\" of irreparable loss and destruction. Hamdan Taha of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has published reports concerning the preservation of this and other sites in the Jericho region. In 2020, it was added to the tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Palestine.\nIn 2021, the restoration of the bath complex's 835-square-meter mosaic floor was completed, at a cost of 12 million USD and with Japanese funding, with a dome-shaped shelter protecting the mosaics, which was designed and executed by a Japanese architecture office. The mosaics can be viewed from walkways suspended over the floor.\n\nMuseum\nThe Hisham's Palace Museum is located within the grounds of the Hisham's Palace archaeological site. The museum was established in 2000. It displays relics and examples of pottery from the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates, discovered within the Umayyad palace complex. The museum also houses ancient artifacts from the Khirbet al-Mafjar site.\n\nTourism\nHisham's Palace is one of the most important Islamic monuments in Palestine, and is a major attraction for both visitors and Palestinians. In 2010, according to figures collected by the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, the site received 43,455 visitors. The site is a common field trip destination for Palestinian schoolchildren. Foreign visitors who enter Palestine through the nearby Allenby Bridge often make Hisham's Palace their first stop. The site has been visited by foreign dignitaries, and was the set for a production of Shakespeare's Richard II in 2012.\nSince 2021, the mosaic floor of the bath complex has been opened to the public after the completion of restoration and preservation work and the building of a shelter provided with walkways placed above the floor.\n\nSee also\nLevantine archaeology\nList of archaeological sites in Israel and Palestine\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nFurther reading\nHamilton, Robert W.

          "content": "Tell es-Sultan (Arabic: تل السلطان, lit. Sultan's Hill), also known as Tel Jericho or Ancient Jericho, is an archaeological site and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Palestine, in the city of Jericho, consisting of the remains of the oldest fortified city in the world.\nIt is located adjacent to the Ein es-Sultan refugee camp, two kilometres north of the centre of the Palestinian city of Jericho. The tell was inhabited from the 10th millennium BCE, which makes Jericho among the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world. The site is notable for its role in the history of Levantine archaeology.\nThe area was first identified as the site of ancient Jericho in modern times by Charles Warren in 1868, on the basis of its proximity to the large spring of Ein es-Sultan, that had been proposed as the spring of Elisha by Edward Robinson three decades earlier.\n\nHistory and archaeology\nEpipalaeolithic\nThe droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas came to an end around 9600 BCE, ushering in the Holocene epoch and the Epipaleolithic period of human history. The resulting warmer climate made it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement. The first permanent settlement at Tell es-Sultan—marked by the construction of  Natufian structures—developed between 10,000 and 9000 BCE, which appears to predate the invention of agriculture. Tell es-Sultan was a popular camping ground for Natufian hunter-gatherer groups due to the nearby Ein as-Sultan spring; these hunter-gatherers left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA)\nThe Pre-Pottery Neolithic A phase at Tell es-Sultan (c. 8500–7500 BCE) saw the emergence of one of the world's first major proto-cities. As the world warmed up, a new culture based on agriculture and sedentary dwelling emerged, which archaeologists have termed \"Pre-Pottery Neolithic A\" (abbreviated as PPNA), sometimes called the Sultanian era after the town. PPNA villages are characterized by small circular dwellings, burial of the dead under the floor of buildings, reliance on hunting wild game, the cultivation of wild or domestic cereals, and no use of pottery yet.\nThe PPNA-era town, a settlement of around 4 hectares (9.9 acres), contained round mud-brick houses, yet no street planning. Circular dwellings were built of clay and straw bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about 5 metres (16 ft) across, and was roofed with mud-smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes.\nThe identity and number of the inhabitants of Jericho during the PPNA period is still under debate, with estimates going as high as 2,000–3,000, and as low as 200–300. It is known that this population had cultivated emmer wheat, barley and pulses and hunted wild animals.\nThe town was surrounded by a massive stone wall over 3.6 metres (12 ft) high and 1.8 metres (6 ft) wide at the base, inside of which stood a stone tower, placed in the centre of the west side of the tell. This tower was the tallest structure in the world until the Pyramid of Djoser, and the second-oldest tower after the one at Tell Qaramel. The wall and tower were built around 8000 BCE. For the tower carbon dates published in 1981 and 1983 indicate that it was built around 8300 BCE and stayed in use until c. 7800 BCE. The wall and tower would have taken a hundred men more than a hundred days to construct, thus suggesting some kind of social organization and division of labour.\nThe major structures help understand Sultanian settlements in the southern Levant.\n\nPre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB)\nAfter a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase, there was a settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the tell. This second settlement, established in 6800 BCE, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten plastered human skulls, painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features. These represent either teraphim or an early example of portraiture in art history, and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.\nThe architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumbprints to facilitate bonding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room (6.5 m × 4 m (21 ft × 13 ft)) and a second slightly smaller room (7 m × 3 m (23 ft × 10 ft)) containing internal divisions. The remaining areas are small, and presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish terrazzo-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.\nKathleen Kenyon interpreted one building as a shrine. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fit into this niche.\nThe dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A skull cache contained seven human skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; cowries were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modeled skulls were found in Tell Ramad and Beisamoun as well.\nOther finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, burins, scrapers, a few tranchet axes, obsidian, and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also querns, hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, anthropomorphic and theriomorphic clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.\n\nBronze Age\nA succession of settlements followed from 4500 BCE onward, the largest constructed in the Early Bronze Age, around 2600 BCE. Tell es-Sultan has been occupied, destroyed, and abandoned many times, as evidenced by its many destruction layers.\nThe site appears to have been continuously occupied from the Early Bronze Age into the early part of the Middle Bronze Age.  Radiocarbon dating suggests the city was destroyed and abandoned around 2000/1950 BCE. The city was subsequently reconstructed, reaching its greatest extent in the period from 1700 to 1550 BCE. At that time, it was a small but important city of the Canaan region which reflected the greater urbanization in the area. The city has been linked to the rise of the Maryannu, a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the Mitannite state to the north. It was surrounded by extensive defensive walls strengthened with rectangular towers, and possessed an extensive cemetery with vertical shaft-tombs and underground burial chambers; the elaborate funeral offerings in some of these may reflect the emergence of local kings. Kathleen Kenyon reported \"the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna'an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period\" and there was \"a massive stone revetment;... part of a complex system\" of defenses (pp. 213–218).\nThe city was destroyed again in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age. The calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer date to 1617–1530 BCE. Although this destruction is dated to 16th century by carbon dating, scholars propose that this destruction could be ascribed to either Ahmose I(1549-1524 BCE), whose royal signet was found in the necropolis in a slightly later LB I tomb, or Tuthmose III(1479-1425 BCE), whose scarab was recovered from a cemetery northwest of Jericho. Following this destruction, the town was reoccupied again during the Late Bronze Age (1550–1200 BC), with the previous Middle Bronze city wall being refurbished by adding a mudbrick wall on top of its surviving crest. According to Lorenzo Nigro, the top Late Bronze IIB layers of the tell were heavily cut by levelling operations during the Iron Age, which explains the scarcity of 13th century materials.\n\nIron Age\nOccupation in Tell es-Sultan appears to have resumed in the 11th century BCE, with the town becoming fortified again in the 10th century. Of this new city not much more remains than a four-room house on the eastern slope. By the 7th century Jericho had become an extensive town, but this settlement was destroyed in the Babylonian conquest of Judah in the early 6th century.\n\nAbandonment of the tell\nIn response to Judah's revolts against Babylon, Jericho was destroyed by the Babylonians in 587/586 BCE. The city was rebuilt during the Persian period after the Jews were freed from the Babylonian captivity. There are very few remains from this period, and the site was abandoned as a place of settlement not long after this period.\n\nArchaeological excavation\nThe first excavations of the tells around Ain es-Sultan (Arabic: عين سلطان, lit. 'Sultan's spring') were made by Charles Warren in 1868 on behalf of the Palestine Exploration Fund. Warren excavated nine mounds in the area of the spring; during one of the excavations his workmen dug through the mud bricks of the wall without realizing what it was.\nThe spring had been identified in 1838 in Edward Robinson's Biblical Researches in Palestine as \"the scene of Elisha's miracle\", on the basis of it being the primary spring near to Jericho. On this basis Warren proposed the surrounding mounds as the site of Ancient Jericho, but he did not have the funds to carry out a full excavation. Believing that it was clearly the spring where Elisha healed, he suggested shifting the entire mound for evidence, which he thought could be done for £400.\nErnst Sellin and Carl Watzinger excavated Tell es-Sultan and Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq between 1907 and 1909 and in 1911, finding the remains of two walls which they initially suggested supported the biblical account of the Battle of Jericho. They later revised this conclusion and dated their finds to the Middle Bronze Age (1950–1550 BCE).\nThe site was again excavated by John Garstang between 1930 and 1936, who again raised the suggestion that remains of the upper wall was that described in the Bible, and dated to around 1400 BCE.\nExtensive investigations using more modern techniques were made by Kathleen Kenyon between 1952 and 1958. Her excavations discovered a tower and wall in trench I. Kenyon provided evidence that both constructions dated much earlier than previous estimates of the site's age, to the Neolithic, and were part of an early proto-city. Her excavations found a series of seventeen early Bronze Age walls, some of which she thought may have been destroyed by earthquakes. The last of the walls was put together in a hurry, indicating that the settlement had been destroyed by nomadic invaders. Another wall was built by a more sophisticated culture in the Middle Bronze Age with a steep plastered escarpment leading up to mud bricks on top.\nLorenzo Nigro and Nicolo Marchetti conducted excavations in 1997–2000. Since 2009 the Italian-Palestinian archaeological project of excavation and restoration was resumed by Rome \"La Sapienza\" University and Palestinian MOTA-DACH under the direction of Lorenzo Nigro and Hamdan Taha.\nRenewed excavations were carried out at Tell es-Sultan from 2009 to 2023 by the Italian-Palestinian Expedition directed by Lorenzo Nigro for Sapienza University of Rome and Jehad Yasine for the Ministry of Tourism & Antiquities of Palestine. These works uncovered several monuments of the Bronze Age City: the Palaces on the Spring Hill (Early Bronze II–III, 3000–2350 BCE; MB I–II, called \"Palace of the Shepherds Kings\" and the MB III palace, called \"Hyksos' Palace\"), the south-east Gate, called Jerusalem Gate, and several traits of the ancient city walls.\n\nWalls\nThe PPNA-era city wall was designed for either defensive or flood protection purposes; the mass of the wall (approximately 1.5 to 2 metres (4.9 to 6.6 ft) thick and 3.7 to 5.2 metres (12 to 17 ft) high) as well as that of the tower suggests a defensive purpose as well. It is suggested to date to approximately 8000 BCE. If interpreted as an \"urban fortification\", the Wall of Jericho is the oldest city wall discovered by archaeologists anywhere in the world. Surrounding the wall was a ditch 8.2 metres (27 ft) wide by 2.7 metres (9 ft) deep, cut through solid bedrock with a circumference around the town of as much as 600 metres (2,000 ft). Kenyon commented that the \"labour involved in excavating this ditch out of solid rock must have been tremendous.\"\n\nTower of Jericho\nThe Tower of Jericho is an 8.5-metre-tall (28 ft) stone structure, built in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A period around 8000 BCE. It is among the earliest stone monuments of mankind. Conical in shape, the tower is almost 9 metres (30 ft) in diameter at the base, decreasing to 7 metres (23 ft) at the top, with walls approximately 1.5 metres (5 ft) thick. It contains an internal staircase with 22 stone steps.\n\nComparative Chronology\nReferences\nBibliography\nJacobs, Paul F. (2000). \"Jericho\".

          "content": "Mount Gerizim ( GHERR-iz-im; Samaritan Hebrew: ࠄࠟࠓࠬࠂࠟࠓࠩࠆࠝࠉࠌ, romanized: ʾĀ̊rgā̊rīzem; Hebrew: הַר גְּרִזִים, romanized: Har Gərīzīm; Arabic: جَبَل جَرِزِيم, romanized: Jabal Jarizīm, or جَبَلُ ٱلطُّورِ, Jabal at-Ṭūr) is one of two mountains near the Palestinian city of Nablus and the biblical city of Shechem, located in the north of Palestine’s West Bank. It forms the southern side of the valley in which Nablus is situated, the northern side being formed by Mount Ebal. The mountain is one of the highest peaks in the West Bank and rises to 881 m (2,890 ft) above sea level, 70 m (230 ft) lower than Mount Ebal. The mountain is particularly steep on the northern side, is sparsely covered at the top with shrubbery, and lower down there is a spring with a high yield of fresh water. The mountain is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as the place where, upon first entering the Promised Land after the Exodus, the Israelites performed ceremonies of blessings, as they had been instructed by Moses.\nIn Samaritan tradition, it is the oldest and most central mountain in the world, towering above the Great Flood and providing the first land for Noah’s disembarkation. Samaritans believe that Mount Gerizim is the location where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac. Jews, on the other hand, consider the location of the near-sacrifice to be Mount Moriah. Samaritans regard Mount Gerizim, rather than Jerusalem's Temple Mount, as the location chosen by God for a holy temple. A Samaritan Temple was located on Mount Gerizim from the 5th century BCE until it was destroyed in the 2nd century BCE. Mount Gerizim continues to be the centre of Samaritan religion, and Samaritans ascend it three times a year: at Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot.\nThe Samaritan village of Kiryat Luza and an Israeli settlement, Har Brakha, are situated on the ridge of Mount Gerizim. During the First Intifada in 1987, many Samaritan families relocated from Nablus to Mount Gerizim to avoid the violence. Today, about half of the remaining Samaritans live near Gerizim, mostly in the village of Kiryat Luza.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of the mountain may mean \"mountain of the Girzites\", a tribe of Philistia that, according to the Hebrew Bible, was conquered by David. Another possible meaning is \"mountain cut in two\".\n\nHistory\nBronze Age\nThe Israelites are believed to have entered Canaan sometime in the 12th or 13th century BCE, around the time of the Late Bronze Age collapse. According to the Book of Deuteronomy, when they first entered Canaan the Israelites celebrated the event with ceremonies of blessings that took place on Mount Gerizim, and cursings on nearby Mount Ebal.\nThe Pulpit Commentary suggests that these mountains were probably selected because they are located roughly in the center of Israel. A commentary in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges argues that \"the face of Gerizim, the mount of blessing, is the more fertile; the opposite face of Ebal, the mount of curse, much the more bare\", but the Pulpit Commentary states that both Gerizim and Ebal are \"equally barren-looking, though neither is wholly destitute of culture and vegetation\".\nThe Masoretic Text version of Deuteronomy says that Moses had also commanded the Israelites to build an altar on Mount Ebal, constructed from natural (rather than cut) stones, to place stones there and whiten them with lime, to make sacrificial offerings on the altar, eat there, and write the Mosaic Law in stones there. The Samaritan Pentateuch version of Deuteronomy, as well as an ancient manuscript of the biblical text found in the Qumran Caves, both contain the same text as the Masoretic Text, with the only difference being the name \"Gerizim\", instead of \"Ebal\", therefore stating that Moses commanded the building of the altar on Mount Gerizim. Recent work on the Dead Sea Scrolls, which include the oldest surviving manuscripts of Deuteronomy, further supports the accuracy of the Samaritan Pentateuch's designation of Mount Gerizim, rather than Mount Ebal, as the first location in the Promised Land where Moses commanded an altar to be built.\nAll versions of Deuteronomy then have Moses specifying how the Israelites should split into two groups. The tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin were to go to Gerizim to pronounce blessings, while those of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali were to remain on Ebal to pronounce curses.\n\nIron Age\nThe altar on Mount Ebal is again mentioned in the Book of Joshua, when, after the Battle of Ai, the Israelites build an altar of unhewn stones and make offerings on it, and Joshua inscribes the Law of Moses on the stones. The Israelites then split into the two groups specified in the Book of Deuteronomy to pronounce blessings on Mount Gerizim and curses on Mount Ebal.\nMount Gerizim is also the setting of the first parable in the Bible. According to a narrative in the Book of Judges, Jotham ascends to the summit of Mount Gerizim and delivers the \"Parable of the Bramble King\" to the people of Shechem. The parable is a story about the trees who wanted to appoint the bramble (possibly Ziziphus spina-christi, a thorny tree with crooked branches) as their king, an allusion to the people of Shechem who wanted to make the ungodly and treacherous Abimelech their king.\n\nPersian period\nSanballat I established a Samaritan temple dedicated to Yahweh at the summit of Mount Gerizim in the mid-to-late 5th century BCE. Josephus describes the construction of the Temple on Gerizim and says it was modeled on the Temple in Jerusalem. A city of more than 10,000 inhabitants named Luzah (modern-day Kiryat Luza) was situated adjacent to the temple. By that time, the Israelites were divided as \"Samaritans\" and \"Jews\", both claiming descendance from the Biblical Israelites and preaching adherence to the Torah, but differing on the holiest place on Earth to adore God: Mount Gerizim for the Samaritans, and Jerusalem for the Jews.\n\nHellenistic period\nDuring the 3rd century BCE, the Samaritans built an ancient city adjacent to Mount Gerizim, which became the capital of the Samaritan community. In 168 BCE, Antiochus IV Epiphanes constructed a temple for the worship of Zeus Xenios (Zeus as the patron of hospitality and guests, avenger of wrongs done to strangers) on Mount Gerizim.\n\nReligious rivalry between Samaritans and Jews led to the destruction of the Mount Gerizim Temple by the latter in 112–111 BCE, on orders of John Hyrcanus. Even after the destruction of their temple by the Jews, Mount Gerizim continued to be the holiest place for the Samaritans, as mentioned in the Gospel of John in the New Testament. Coins produced by a Roman mint situated in Nablus, dated to 138–161 CE, seemingly depict the destroyed Samaritan temple, showing a huge temple complex, statues, and a staircase leading from Nablus to the temple.\n\nRoman Empire\nIn the Gospel of John, in his discussion with the Samaritan woman at the well, Jesus discusses the merits of worshipping at the Mount Gerizim Temple (as the Samaritans did) versus at the Temple in Jerusalem (as the Jews then did): Jesus said to her, \"Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.\"\nIn 36 CE, unrest flared in Samaria when a Samaritan prophet (possibly Dositheos) rallied Samaritans to Mount Gerizim, promising to show them the sacred vessels buried there by Moses. Pontius Pilate, Roman governor of Judaea, alarmed by the growing assembly, deployed troops to block their ascent. This led to clashes, fatalities, and arrests, prompting Samaritan leaders to accuse Pilate of brutality. In response, Lucius Vitellius, the legate of Syria, deposed Pilate (replacing Pilate with Marcellus) and sent him to Rome for investigation by Emperor Tiberius, who died before Pilate's arrival.\nIn the summer of 67, during the First Jewish–Roman War, a large group of armed Samaritans gathered on Mount Gerizim. Vespasian dispatched Legio V Macedonica (commanded by Cerialis) to disarm and disperse them. While some surrendered upon the Romans' arrival, the majority chose to fight. According to Josephus, the Roman forces slaughtered 11,600 Samaritans in this conflict.\nIn the late 4th century, when Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, Samaritans were barred from worshiping on Mount Gerizim. In 475, a Christian church was built on its summit. In 484, during the reign of Emperor Zeno, a martyrium-type octagonal church dedicated to the Theotokos (the God-bearing Virgin Mary) was erected at the site. In 529, Justinian I made Samaritanism illegal and arranged for a protective wall to be constructed around the church. As a result, the same year, Julianus ben Sabar led a pro-Samaritan revolt and by 530 had captured most of Samaria, destroying churches and killing priests and officials. However, in 531, after Justinian enlisted the help of Ghassanids, the revolt was completely quashed, and surviving Samaritans were mostly enslaved or exiled. In 533, Justinian had a castle constructed on Mount Gerizim to protect the church from raids by the few disgruntled Samaritans left in the area.\nAccording to Abu'l-Fath, Continuation of the Samaritan Chronicle, during Sukkot in the seventh year of Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil's reign (855), the governor of Nablus forbade Samaritans from praying aloud and blowing the shofar. However, the following Thursday, they ascended the mountain and prayed loudly without interruption.\n\nArchaeology\nExcavations at the site were initiated in 1983 and continued until 2006, yielding tens of thousands of finds. Remnants found there identified that a Samaritan temple existed atop Mount Gerizim by the mid-5th century BCE and that it was destroyed and rebuilt in the early 2nd century BCE, only to be destroyed again in 111–110 BCE by Jewish forces. The archeological finds have shown that the precincts of the Samaritan temple, not including its gates, measured roughly 98 square metres (1,050 square feet). Inside the perimeter, thousands of pottery vessels and burned bones of animal sacrifices were found – sheep, goats, cattle, and doves – as well as many stones with inscriptions containing the Tetragrammaton (the name of God).\nIn 475, a Christian church was built on the summit. As a result of the fortified church and the previous Samaritan temple, extensive ruins still exist at the somewhat plateau-like top of Gerizim. The line of the wall around the church can easily be seen, as can portions of the former castle, and initial archaeological study of the site postulated that the castle built by Justinian had used stones from an earlier structure on the site, probably the Samaritan temple. In the centre of the plateau is a smooth surface, containing a hollow.\nThe excavation, initiated when the site was in the possession of Jordan and continued under Israeli rule, uncovered Corinthian columns, a large rectangular platform surrounded by walls 2 m (6 ft 7 in) thick and 9 m (30 ft), and a staircase leading down from the platform to a marbled esplanade. The complex also has a series of cisterns in which ceramics dated to the late Roman period were found. These discoveries are now called \"structure A\", and have been dated to the time of Hadrian from excavated coins and external literary evidence. Underneath these remains was found a large stone structure built on top of the bedrock. This structure, now known as \"structure B\", has no internal rooms or dividing walls and consists almost entirely of uncut limestone slabs fitted together without any mortar. Structure B was surrounded by a courtyard similar to the platform above it, and from ceramics found in a cistern cut into the bedrock at its northern side, it was dated to during or just before the Hellenistic period. The excavating archaeologist considered structure B to be the altar built by the Samaritans in the 5th or 6th century.\n\nSee also\nSamaritan revolts\n\nReferences\nCited works\nBerlin, Adele (2011).

          "summary": "Mount Gerizim ( GHERR-iz-im; Samaritan Hebrew: ࠄࠟࠓࠬࠂࠟࠓࠩࠆࠝࠉࠌ, romanized: ʾĀ̊rgā̊rīzem; Hebrew: הַר גְּרִזִים, romanized: Har Gərīzīm; Arabic: جَبَل جَرِزِيم, romanized: Jabal Jarizīm, or جَبَلُ ٱلطُّورِ, Jabal at-Ṭūr) is one of two mountains near the Palestinian city of Nablus and the biblical city of Shechem, located in the north of Palestine’s West Bank. It forms the southern side of the valley in which Nablus is situated, the northern side being formed by Mount Ebal. The mountain is one of the highest peaks in the West Bank and rises to 881 m (2,890 ft) above sea level, 70 m (230 ft) lower than Mount Ebal. The mountain is particularly steep on the northern side, is sparsely covered at the top with shrubbery, and lower down there is a spring with a high yield of fresh water. The mountain is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as the place where, upon first entering the Promised Land after the Exodus, the Israelites performed ceremonies of blessings, as they had been instructed by Moses.\nIn Samaritan tradition, it is the oldest and most central mountain in the world, towering above the Great Flood and providing the first land for Noah’s disembarkation. Samaritans believe that Mount Gerizim is the location where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac. Jews, on the other hand, consider the location of the near-sacrifice to be Mount Moriah. Samaritans regard Mount Gerizim, rather than Jerusalem's Temple Mount, as the location chosen by God for a holy temple. A Samaritan Temple was located on Mount Gerizim from the 5th century BCE until it was destroyed in the 2nd century BCE. Mount Gerizim continues to be the centre of Samaritan religion, and Samaritans ascend it three times a year: at Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot.\nThe Samaritan village of Kiryat Luza and an Israeli settlement, Har Brakha, are situated on the ridge of Mount Gerizim. During the First Intifada in 1987, many Samaritan families relocated from Nablus to Mount Gerizim to avoid the violence. Today, about half of the remaining Samaritans live near Gerizim, mostly in the village of Kiryat Luza.",

          "content": "The Herodeion (Ancient Greek: Ἡρώδειον), in Latin: Herodium, in Modern Hebrew: הרודיון Herodion, known in Arabic as Jabal al-Fureidis (Arabic: جبل فريديس, lit. '\"Mountain of the Little Paradise\"') is a fortified desert palace built by Herod the Great, king of Judaea, in the first century BCE. The complex stands atop a hill in the Judaean Desert, approximately 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) south of Jerusalem and 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) southeast of Bethlehem, between Beit Ta'mir, Za'atara to the east and Jannatah, Tekoa and Nokdim to the west. The site is located at an elevation of 758 meters (2,487 ft) above sea level.\nHerodium was originally built by Herod to commemorate his victory in 40 BCE over the Hasmonean ruler Antigonus II Mattathias during their struggle for control of Judaea. The site stands atop an artificial, cone-shaped hill that dominates the surrounding landscape and can be seen from Jerusalem. At its summit, Herod's engineers built a fortified palace with double walls, towers, a Roman-style bathhouse, banquet halls, and residential quarters. At the base, a lower palace complex was built complete with gardens, courtyards, and a large pool fed by aqueducts. According to the historian Josephus, Herod was buried at the site following his death in 4 BCE.\nHerodium remained active during the Jewish–Roman wars. Jewish rebels occupied the site during the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE), repurposing the dining hall into a synagogue before it was captured by the Romans in 71 CE. The fort was again used as a rebel base during the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–135 CE), after which it was abandoned. From 1972 onward, intermittent excavations were carried out by Prof. Ehud Netzer, working on behalf of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 2007, he found and identified the long sought-after tomb of King Herod on the northern slope of the hill. Netzer excavated mostly the lower palace, at the base of the hill; he fell to his death at the site in 2010.\nThe site is in Area C of the West Bank, formally under the jurisdiction of the Israeli Civil Administration, a body of military officers, and in practice it is administered jointly with the Israel Nature and Parks Authority. Israel asserts that it is entitled to work in the area under the Oslo Accords, but the Palestinian authorities say Israel has no right to undertake digs there or remove artifacts that Israel discovered in excavations there.\n\nEtymology\nHerodium is the only site that is named after King Herod the Great. It was known by the Crusaders as the \"Mountain of Franks\". Palestinian locals historically called it Jabal al-Firdous or Jabal al-Fureidis (Arabic: جبل فريديس, lit. \"Mountain of the Little Paradise\"); Edward Robinson in 1838 described it as \"Frank Mountain\", in reference to the Crusaders.\nIn 1841, Edward Robinson's identified the site in Biblical Researches in Palestine as Herodium based on the description found in Josephus. Josephus described a palace fortress and a small town, named after Herod the Great, built between 23 and 15 BCE. A sarcophagus discovered in 2007 was claimed to belong to Herod as it was more ornate than others found in the area.\nThe modern English name is a transliteration of the Greek spelling (Ancient Greek: Ἡρώδειον). This is followed by the Modern Arabic (Arabic: هيروديون) and the Modern Hebrew (Herodion Hebrew: הרודיון). The name Herodis (Hebrew: הרודיס) was found in the 1960s inscribed in one of the Bar Kokhba letters recovered from the Muraba’at Caves in the Judaean desert, and is thought to represent the original Hebrew name for the site.\n\nHistory\nConstruction\nIn 40 BCE, after the Parthian conquest of Syria, Herod fled to Masada. On the way, at the location of Herodion, Herod clashed with Jews loyal to his enemy Antigonus, and emerged victorious. According to the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, he \"built a town on that spot in commemoration of his victory, and enhanced it with wonderful palaces... and he called it Herodion after himself\".\nJosephus describes Herodium as follows:\n\nThis fortress, which is some sixty stadia distant from Jerusalem, is naturally strong and very suitable for such a structure, for reasonably nearby is a hill, raised to a (greater) height by the hand of man and rounded off in the shape of a breast. At intervals it has round towers, and it has a steep ascent formed of two hundred steps of hewn stone. Within it are costly royal apartments made for security and for ornament at the same time. At the base of the hill there are pleasure grounds built in such a way as to be worth seeing, among other things because of the way in which water, which is lacking in that place, is brought in from a distance and at great expense. The surrounding plain was built up as a city second to none, with the hill serving as an acropolis for the other dwellings.\nArchaeologists believe that the palace was designed by architects and built by slaves and paid workers (contractors).  Herod was considered one of the greatest builders of his time and was not daunted by geography—his palace was built on the edge of the desert and was situated atop an artificial hill. The largest of the four towers was built on a stone base 18 meters in diameter. This was most likely where Herod lived; he decorated his rooms with mosaic floors and elaborate frescoes. The other three towers, which consisted of living spaces and storage, were 16 meters in diameter. Outside, several cisterns were built to collect water that was channeled into the palace.\nThe city of Herodium served as a capital of a toparchy.\n\nGreat Jewish Revolt\nDuring the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE), Herodium was held by Jewish rebels. At some point during the revolt, the fort's defenders transformed Herod's triclinium into a synagogue. In 68 CE, rebel leader Simon bar Giora, then operating from nearby Teqoa, attempted to seize Herodium. He sent an emissary, Eleazar, to persuade the garrison to surrender, but the defenders uncovered the plot and expelled him. Eleazar then threw himself from the fortress ramparts.\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE, Herodium remained one of three major fortresses (alongside Machaerus and Masada) still under rebel control, though the specific faction holding it is uncertain. By this time, the site appears to have been defended by a relatively small force, likely joined by refugees fleeing Jerusalem. Herodium was ultimately captured, likely in early 72 CE, by the Roman legate Sextus Lucilius Bassus. The fortress seems to have fallen rapidly, as Josephus provides only a brief mention of its surrender.\n\nBar Kokhba revolt\nAt the beginning of the Bar Kokhba revolt sixty years later, Simon bar Kokhba declared Herodium as his secondary headquarters. The fortress was commanded by Yeshua ben Galgula, who was likely in Bar Kokhba's second or third line of command. Archaeological evidence for the revolt was found all over the site, from the outside buildings to the water system under the mountain. Inside the water system, supporting walls built by the rebels were discovered, and another system of caves was found. Inside one of the caves, burned wood was found which was dated to the time of the revolt.\nAs in other parts of Judea during the final stages of the Bar Kokhba revolt, the rebels active in Herodium likely sought shelter in nearby refuge caves, including the cave of El Matzia.\n\nExcavation history\nUpper Herodium\nThe archaeological excavation of Herodium was begun in 1962 by Virgilio Canio Corbo and Stanislao Loffreda, from the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum of Jerusalem, and it continued until 1967: they discovered the upper citadel, at the top of the hill.\n\nLower Herodium\nFrom 1972, excavations were carried out by Ehud Netzer, working on behalf of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and they were intermittent until the archaeologist's death in 2010. Netzer excavated mostly the lower palace, at the base of the hill.\n\nDescription\nHerod's hilltop palace\nHerod the Great built a palace within the fortress of Herodium. Herod himself commissioned a lavish palace to be built between 23 and 15 BCE atop Herodium for all to see. The palace itself consisted of four towers of seven stories, a bathhouse, courtyards, a Roman theatre, banquet rooms, a large walkway (\"the course\"), as well as extravagant living quarters for himself and guests. Once Herod died and the Great Revolt started, Herodium was abandoned. The Jews eventually had a base at Herodium where they built a synagogue which can still be seen today, unlike much of Herod's Palace.\n\nBathhouse\nThe Roman bathhouse consisted of three areas, the caldarium, the tepidarium, and the frigidarium. It also had a very impressive dome which is still in good condition today despite thousands of years of earthquakes and wars. The caldarium had vaulted ceilings, raised floors, and channels in the walls to conduct heat. The tepidarium had mosaic floors and frescoes just like the living quarters of the palace. The frigidarium, the last stop in the bathhouse, was where guests would cool off in a large pool.\n\nSynagogue\nDuring the First Jewish–Roman War, the defenders of Herodium repurposed an existing structure within the upper palace as a synagogue, considered one of the earliest in the Levant. The original space, formerly Herod's triclinium, underwent renovations that involved installing benches along the walls and constructing a mikveh outside the entrance. There is minimal evidence regarding any alterations made by the defenders to the existing decor or furnishings, and the space essentially functioned as a simple communal hall. The entrance faced eastward, while Jerusalem lay almost due north. The repurposed synagogue lacked specialized features commonly found in synagogues, such as a niche for housing the Torah scrolls and a reading desk.\n\nTheatre\nNetzer discovered the Roman Theatre just before his death in late 2010. The royal theatre was uncovered near the base of Herod's tomb. The theatre contained an elaborately decorated loggia, or a theatre box, was discovered. This means that when Herod or other notable officials went to see a play, they would receive luxury treatment. The rest of the audience would be seated below on benches that could accommodate about 450–650 people. What is quite unique about this find is that frescoes of landscapes were discovered, of a kind suggesting that the painters were well travelled; they depict scenes of Italy and even the Nile River in Egypt. It is also assumed that the painters were on loan to Herod from Caesar in Rome.\n\nPilate ring\nIn 1968–1969, during excavations directed by archaeologist Gideon Foerster, at a section of Herod's burial tomb and palace hundreds of artifacts were found, including a copper alloy ring. The ring was overlooked but in 2018 it was given a thorough laboratory cleaning and scholarly examination. At the center of the ring is an engraved krater, or amphora similar in style to the monumental urn (handleless amphorae or acroteria) of Herodium which is encircled by \"partly deformed\" Greek letters spelling out \"of Pilates\" in Greek. Although scientists were not sure about who is the \"Pilates\" mentioned on the ring, media published that it could have possibly belonged to Pontius Pilate. Archaeologist Roi Porat said that all explanations are equally possible for the owner of the ring: \"It was important to publish a careful scientific article, but in practice we have a ring inscribed with the name Pilate and the personal connection just cries out.\"\nWhile much of the debate has focused on the Greek name inscribed on the ring, the image is of equal significance and may further support that this was the ring used by Pilate's administrative assistant for sealing documents for Pilate. The image on the ring is possibly associated with Roman religious ceremonies (i.e., suovetaurilia, bacchanalia) and the imperial cult that were characteristic of the images on the coins that Pilate had minted during his term as governor.\n\nLegal aspects\nIn February 2013 an exhibit dedicated to Herod at the Israel Museum featured finds from among some 30 tons of material transferred from the Herodium site back into Israel. The Palestinian National Authority protested, and Rula Maayah, the Palestinian tourism and antiquities minister said that according to international law Israelis have no right to excavate Herodium, which is in the occupied West Bank, or to take any antiquities from it. Palestinian officials compared the exhibition to the historical plunder of archaeological treasures by former colonial powers. Some Israeli commentators have argued that, such excavations of, and removal of material from, sites in the Palestinian territories go beyond what is permitted to an occupying power such as Israel. One Israeli archaeologist, Yonathan Mizrachi, in an article co-written with Yigal Bronner, stated that, 'Since Herodion and Herod's palaces in Jericho are located in the territories that Israel occupied in 1967, they are—according to international law, the codes of ethics for the preservation of antiquities, and even the Oslo Accords—supposedly under Palestinian control and responsibility.' The Israel Museum's director, James S. Snyder initially stated that the items from Herodium would be returned to the West Bank after the exhibition, \"in better condition than before\", but later clarified that this did not mean the artifacts would be returned to the Palestinians after the exhibition. The site is in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli control. The Israel Museum cited the Oslo Accords as giving Israel a right to perform archaeology in the territories and said they will return it to the West Bank when the exhibition has ended. In analyzing the controversy, Morag Kersel states that the site is regulated by Israeli military orders, the Jordanian Temporary Law no. 51, 1966, and the Oslo Accords. According to the provisions of the Oslo II Accord, archaeological issues of common interest would be handled by a joint Israeli–Palestinian committee. Few if any of these agreements have been implemented, and Palestinians have not been consulted or asked to collaborate in the work at the site.\n\nFilms\nHerod's Lost Tomb (2008; National Geographic Society), in addition to examining Netzer's purported find of Herod's tomb, the palace and most of Herod's other large projects are reconstructed in CGI.\n\"Finding Jesus: Faith, Fact, Forgery: Season 2, Episode 4: The tomb of Herod\" (2017; CNN), the episode unpacks the epic story of the client king of Judea.\nJesus Christ Superstar (1973), the song \"Then We Are Decided\" was filmed here.\n\nSee also\nAncient synagogues in the Palestine region - covers entire Palestine region/Land of Israel\nHerodian architecture\nJohn McRay\nMachaerus\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nDavies, Gwyn (2023). \"Stamping Out the Embers: Roman \"Mopping-Up\" Operations at the End of the First Jewish Revolt\".

          "content": "The Qumran Caves (Arabic: كهوف قمران Kuhūf Qumrān; Hebrew: מערות קומראן HaMeara Kumran) are a series of caves, both natural and artificial, found around the archaeological site of Qumran in the Judaean Desert. It is in these caves that the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered.\nIsrael Nature and Parks Authority took over the site following the end of the 1967 war, when Israel occupied the West Bank and seized Qumran. Israel has since invested heavily in the area to establish the Qumran caves as a site of \"uniquely Israeli Jewish heritage\". The caves are recognized in Israel as a National Heritage Site, despite the caves being in occupied Palestinian territories; as such, the designation has drawn criticism.\n\nCaves\nThe limestone cliffs above Qumran contain numerous caves that have been used over the millennia: the first traces of occupation are from the Chalcolithic period then onward to the Arab period. The artificial caves relate to the period of the settlement at Qumran and were cut into the marl bluffs of the terrace on which Qumran sits.\n\nArtificial caves\nThe artificial marl-cut caves at Qumran were hewn during the site's late Second Temple occupation. This began in the Hasmonean phase, in the late 2nd to early 1st century BCE, and continued in use through the Herodian period. The caves were contemporaneous with the Qumran settlement on the terrace, and they were functionally linked to it.\n\nIn all there are ten marl cut caves in the near vicinity of Qumran: 4Qa, 4Qb, 5Q, 7Q, 8Q, 9Q, 10Q, an oval cave west of 5Q, and two caves to the north in a separate ravine. Their location necessitates a direct connection with the Qumran settlement. The three caves at the end of the esplanade could only be accessed via the settlement. These caves are thought to have been cut for storage and habitation. The artificial caves at Qumran were cut into soft, rapidly weathering marl of the Lisan Formation, which made excavation easy but led to erosion and collapse. The marl-cut caves on the terrace where caves 7Q, 8Q and 9Q were recorded survive only as eroded, partially collapsed remains.\n4Q, which is now visible from the Qumran esplanade, is actually two caves, one adjacent to the other. De Vaux referred to them as 4a and 4b. When the Ta'amireh removed all the fragments they could before Harding's arrival, there was no way to tell which scrolls belonged to which cave, so they were later all catalogued simply as from 4Q. In excavating the caves hundreds of fragments were still to be found in 4a while only two or three fragments in 4b. 4a was 8 meters long and 3.25 meters wide with tapering walls reaching 3 meters in height.\n\nDead Sea Scrolls Discovery\nIn late 1946 or early 1947, a Bedouin boy of the Ta'amireh tribe, Muhammid Ahmed el-Hamed called edh-Dhib (the wolf), found a cave after searching for a lost animal. He stumbled onto the first cave containing old scrolls. More Ta'amireh visited the cave and scrolls were taken back to their encampment. They were shown to Mar Samuel of the Syriac Orthodox Church in April 1947 who realised their significance and the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls was made known. The location of the cave was not revealed for another 18 months, but eventually a joint investigation of the cave site was led by Roland de Vaux and Gerald Lankester Harding from 15 February to 5 March 1949.\nThe interest in the scrolls with the hope of money from their sale initiated a long area-wide search by the Ta'amireh to find more such scrolls, the first result of which was the discovery of four caves in Wadi Murabba'at about 15 km (9.3 mi) south of Qumran in 1951. In the Qumran area another cave was discovered, now referred to as Cave 2Q (1Q was the first scroll-bearing cave), in February 1952. However, only a few fragments were found in the cave. Fear of the destruction of archaeological evidence with the discovery of caves by the Bedouin led to a campaign by the French and American Schools to explore all other caves to find any remaining scrolls. Although 230 natural caves, crevices and other possible hiding places were examined in an 8-kilometer area along the cliffs near Qumran, only 40 contained any artifacts and one alone, 3Q, produced texts, the most unusual being the Copper Scroll.\n\n4Q was discovered in September 1952 by the Ta'amireh. De Vaux, on being offered a vast amount of fragments, contacted Harding who drove to the Qumran site to find that the Bedouin had discovered caves very near the Qumran ruins. These were Caves 4Q, 5Q, and 6Q, the most important of which was 4Q which originally contained around three-quarters of all the scrolls found in the immediate Qumran area. The first two of these caves had been cut into the marl terrace. The third was at the entrance to the Qumran Gorge just below the aqueduct.\nIn 1955, a survey of the terrace brought to light a staircase leading down to the remains of three more artificial caves, 7Q, 8Q and 9Q at the end of the Qumran esplanade, all of which had collapsed and had been eroded, and a fourth cave, 10Q, on the outcrop which housed caves 4Q and 5Q.\nQumran Cave 11 (11Q), discovered by Ta'amireh Bedouin in early 1956, was the final Qumran cave to yield Dead Sea Scrolls. Finds include Paleo-Hebrew Leviticus scroll (11QpaleoLev), the Great Psalms Scroll (11Q5), and the Temple Scroll. The Temple Scroll entered scholarly custody in 1967, when Yigael Yadin announced Israel's acquisition following the Six-Day War. Between its discovery in Qumran Cave 11 in early 1956 and its transfer to Israeli custody in June 1967, the Temple Scroll remained outside institutional control in Bethlehem, held by the antiquities dealer Khalil Iskander Shahin (Kando), intermittently offered to authorities and intermediaries, hidden for long periods in his home, and known to scholars only through reports and a small fragment circulated in the early 1960s. After the Six-Day War, Yigael Yadin obtained the scroll from Kando for the Shrine of the Book.  Accounts based on Yadin's narrative and later syntheses specify that Kando concealed the manuscript in a shoebox beneath a floor tile in his Bethlehem shop or home until 1967, when Israeli authorities secured it and paid Kando as part of the acquisition. \nIn February 2017, the discovery of cave 12Q was announced, the contents of which included completely broken storage jars and scroll fragments, but no scrolls themselves. The cave was investigated by J. Randall Price and students of Liberty University in Virginia, along with an international team of archaeologists from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. Iron pickaxe heads from the 1950s were also found, which indicate looting had occurred. In addition, archaeologists discovered pottery, flint blades, arrowheads, and a carnelian seal that date to the Chalcolithic and Neolithic periods.\n\"This exciting excavation is the closest we've come to discovering new Dead Sea scrolls in 60 years. Until now, it was accepted that Dead Sea scrolls were found only in 11 caves at Qumran, but now there is no doubt that this is the 12th cave,\" reported Dr. Oren Gutfeld, the head of the excavations.\nAccording to Israel Hasson, Director-General of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), the discovery of this cave showed that significant works were waiting to be done in the Judean Desert and some of important ones were waiting to be revealed.\n\nArchaeological excavations\nIn 1984–1985 Joseph Patrich and Yigael Yadin carried out a systematic survey of over 57 caves north of Qumran and two to the south. In 1985–1991 Patrich excavated five caves, including Caves 3Q and 11Q. One of Patrich's conclusions was that the caves \"did not serve as habitations for the members of the Dead Sea Sect, but rather as stores and hiding places\".\n\nIt was discovered that under the rocks in Cave 3Q there were only a few Chalcolithic sherds, showing that the ceiling had collapsed before any Qumran-era occupation. The cave was uninhabited and used only to store the scrolls left there.\nIn 1988 in the cave Patrich designated as Cave 13, just north of 3Q, a small juglet was found from the Herodian era, which was wrapped in palm fibres and contained a viscous liquid which Patrich presumed was aromatic balsam residue. In 1991 he discovered several jar stoppers and a complete jar along with date stones and dry dates suggesting occupation, but as the area in front of the cave showed no attempt to convert it into a terrace, he concluded that occupation was not of any length.\n11Q was examined and no traces of Qumran era occupation was found. A cave Patrich called Cave 24, which lay between 11Q and 3Q, was large and habitable, but showed no sign of long-term habitation. Cave FQ37 (named in the 1952 survey) located high up on the cliff face 2 kilometers south of Qumran was also an improbable site for permanent dwelling, due to its inaccessibility.\nIn late 1995 and early 1996, Magen Broshi and Hanan Eshel carried out further excavations in the caves north of Qumran. They reported other caves not examined by Patrich and believed that they served as dwellings for the inhabitants of Qumran along with other artificial caves that have long ago eroded away from the edge of the marl terrace.\nBroshi and Eshel concentrated their interest in the area just north of Qumran, examining two caves they designated as C and F in a small ravine. The former had part of its ceiling caved in and was filled with silt from flash floods, but contained 280 potsherds. Cave F had completely collapsed, but when excavated yielded 110 potsherds. They concluded that the area was residential.\nTwo other archaeological sites from the same time period, Ein Feshkha, and Ain el-Ghuweir, both located south of Qumran along the shore of the Dead Sea, are also often linked with Qumran.\n\nSee also\nShrine of the Book\nRockefeller Museum\nAntiquities trade\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nAllegro, J.

          "content": "Saint Hilarion Monastery, at the archaeological site of Tell Umm el-'Amr, was an ancient Christian monastery. Its excavated ruins lay close to Deir al-Balah in the Gaza Strip, Palestine.\n\nHistory and archaeology\nThe monastery was founded in ca. 340 by Hilarion, a native of the Gaza region and one possible father of Palestinian monasticism (see also Chariton the Confessor). Hilarion had converted to Christianity in Alexandria and then, inspired by St Anthony, become a hermit first in Egypt and then in his home region. He then founded a hermitage close to his home village of Thabatha and by the time Hilarion was sixty-three, the monastery was large and attracted many visitors. Though seemingly back then located in the desert, it was in reality at the crossroads between Egypt, Palestine, Syria and Mesopotamia and is believed to be a center of missionary work in the Gaza region.\n\nThe remains of Saint Hilarion Monastery span more than four centuries, from the Late Roman to the Umayyad period, and are characterized by five successive churches, bath and sanctuary complexes, geometric mosaics, and an expansive crypt. As the hermitage was likely consisting of small hermits' cells according to the tradition of St. Anthony build out of mud bricks and perishable material, resulting in that their remains have not been preserved. The site was abandoned after a seventh-century earthquake and rediscovered by local archaeologists in 1999. The fourteenth century pilgrim Antony of Cremona mentioned in his travel report that there was a church called St. Hilarion in Tabatha, but it is uncertain whether he was referring to a building that still existed or if he was retelling information derived from an earlier source. According to local tradition and observations from Western travelers in the 19th century, the prayer hall of the Monastery of Hilarion is currently occupied by the Mosque of al-Khidr. French explorer Victor Guérin noted that two marble columns in the mosque were possibly parts of the Byzantine-era monastery.\n\nCurrent state\nIn 2015, it was the only archaeological site accessible to the public in Gaza, making it an especially treasured and important cultural heritage. According to the Ministry of Tourism in Gaza, the Saint Hilarion Monastery in 2016 was in dire need of preservation. Current preservation efforts are plagued by war and conflict in the region, as well as a shortage of materials and equipment needed for excavation. The site was included on the 2012 World Monuments Watch and classified as \"Rescue Needed\" by Global Heritage Network.\n\nDamage during the Gaza War\nIn December 2023, UNESCO granted the monastery \"provisional enhanced protection\". In January 2024, Al Jazeera reported that the monastery is one of 195 cultural heritage sites that have been damaged or destroyed since Gaza war began. In July 2024, the monastery was included on the List of World Heritage in Danger by UNESCO. The listing was fast-tracked using emergency procedures, with UNESCO expressing \"deep concern about the impact of the ongoing conflict on cultural heritage, particularly in the Gaza Strip\" and stating \"The organization urges all involved parties to strictly adhere to international law, emphasizing that cultural property should not be targeted or used for military purposes, as it is considered civilian infrastructure.\"\n\nSee also\nList of archaeological sites in the Gaza Strip\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nTell Umm el-'Amr on Global Heritage Network\nWorld Monuments Fund 2012 Watch List\nSaint Hilarion Monastery.

Located in the Old City of Acre, it is one of the prominent projects constructed during the rule of Ahmed Jezzar Pasha in Galilee, under the Ottoman era.\n\nHistory\nOttoman period\nBeing one of four Khans in Acre, Khan al-Umdan was built in 1784 on the place of the Royal Customs house of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Due to its plethora of columns the khan was named Khan al-Umdan which means \"Inn of the Columns\" or \"Caravanserai of Pillars\". It incorporates forty columns made of granite that were taken from Caesarea, Atlit and the ruins of Crusader monuments in Acre itself.\n\nDue to its proximity to the port, Khan al-Umdan has throughout its history been an important trading spot. Merchants arriving at Acre used the khan as a warehouse while the second floor functioned as a hostel. Camel caravans once brought produce and grain from Galilean villages to the city's markets and port.\nThe khan later gained importance to the Baháʼí Faith (as the Khán-i-'Avámid) as it was the site where Baha'ullah used to receive guests, and later the site for a Baháʼí school.\nIn 1906 a clock tower was added adjacent to the main entrance to the khan to commemorate the silver jubilee of the rule of Ottoman sultan Abd al-Hamid II. It is similar to the Jaffa Clock Tower, a building dedicated to the same purpose, \n along with five more towers in Ottoman Palestine (in Jerusalem, Haifa, Safed, Nablus, and possibly Nazareth) and over a hundred across the entire empire.\n\nModern era\nIn 2001 Khan al-Umdan, together with the rest of Acre's old city, was designated as a World Heritage Site. In 2004 Khan al-Umdan (Hebrew: ח'אן אל עומדאן) was featured on a stamp of Israel worth 1.3 sheqels. Nowadays, the khan is a major tourist attraction open all hours of the day and used as an open-air stage during festivals in the city, such as the theater festival of Acre during the month of October.\n\nReferences",

          "content": "The Great Mosque of Gaza, also known as the Great Omari Mosque, is a mosque in a ruinous state, located in Gaza City, in the State of Palestine. Prior to its 2023 partial destruction, it was the largest and oldest mosque in the Gaza Strip.\nBelieved to stand on the site of an ancient Philistine temple, the site was used by the Byzantines to erect a church in the 5th century. After the Rashidun conquest in the 7th century, it was transformed into a mosque. The Great Mosque's minaret was toppled in an earthquake in 1033. In 1149, the Crusaders built a large church. It was mostly destroyed by the Ayyubids in 1187, and then rebuilt as a mosque by the Mamluks in the early 13th century.\nIt was destroyed by the Mongols in 1260, then soon restored. It was destroyed by an earthquake at the end of the century. The Great Mosque was restored again by the Ottomans roughly 300 years later. Severely damaged after British bombardment during World War I, the mosque was restored in 1925 by the Supreme Muslim Council. In 2023, during the Gaza war, it was destroyed by the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip, leaving most of the structure collapsed and the minaret partially destroyed.\n\nLocation\nThe Great Mosque is situated in the Daraj Quarter of the Old City in Downtown Gaza at the eastern end of Omar Mukhtar Street, southeast of Palestine Square. Gaza's Gold Market is located adjacent to it on the south side. To the northeast is the Katib al-Wilaya Mosque. To the east, on Wehda Street, is a girls' school.\n\nHistory\nLegendary Philistine roots\nAccording to tradition, the mosque stands on the site of the Philistine temple dedicated to Dagon—the god of fertility—which Samson toppled in the Book of Judges. Later, a temple dedicated to Marnas—god of rain and grain—was erected. Local legend today claims that Samson is buried under the present mosque.\n\nByzantine church\nA Christian basilica was built on the site in the 5th century CE, either during the reign of Eastern Roman Empress Aelia Eudocia, or Emperor Marcianus. In either event, the basilica was finished and appeared on the 6th-century Madaba Map of the Holy Land.\n\nEarly Muslim mosque\nThe Byzantine church was transformed into a mosque in the 7th century by Omar ibn al-Khattab's generals, after the conquest of Roman Palaestina by the Rashidun Caliphate. The mosque is still alternatively named \"al-Omari\", in honour of Omar ibn al-Khattab who was caliph during the Muslim conquest of Palestine. In 985, during Abbasid rule, Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi wrote that the Great Mosque was a \"beautiful mosque.\" On 5 December 1033, an earthquake caused the pinnacle of the mosque's minaret to collapse.\n\nCrusader church\nIn 1149, the Crusaders, who had conquered Gaza in 1100, built a large church atop the ruins of the earlier Byzantine church upon a decree by Baldwin III of Jerusalem. However, in William of Tyre's descriptions of grand Crusader churches, it is not mentioned. Of the Great Mosque's three aisles today, it is believed that portions of two of them had formed part of the Crusader church.\n\nBased on a Jewish bas-relief accompanied by a Hebrew and Greek inscription carved on the upper tier of one of the building's columns, it was suggested in the late 19th century that the upper pillars of the building were brought from a 3rd-century Jewish synagogue in Caesarea Maritima. The discovery of a 6th-century synagogue at  Maiumas, the ancient port of Gaza, in the 1960s make local re-use of this column much likelier. The relief on the column depicted Jewish cultic objects - a menorah, a shofar, a lulav and etrog - surrounded by a decorative wreath, and the inscription read \"Hananyah son of Jacob\" in both Hebrew and Greek. Above it was carved a menorah with a shofar on one side and an etrog on the other. During the late 19th century, the column was part of an old synagogue in Caesarea Maritima and was brought to the mosque for its perceived religious value, as the Caesarea church had appeared in the Madaba Map. The fact that this Jewish symbol was preserved throughout the decades inside the mosque was described as demonstrating \"peaceful coexistence\" by scholar Ziad Shehada.\nIn 1187, the Ayyubids, under Saladin wrested control of Gaza from the Crusaders and destroyed the church.\n\nMamluk mosque\nThe Mamluks reconstructed the mosque in the 13th century. In 1260, the Mongols destroyed it. It was rebuilt, but in 1294, an earthquake caused its collapse.  Extensive renovations centered on the iwan were undertaken by the governor Sunqur al-Ala'i during the sultanate of Husam ad-Din Lajin between 1297 and 1299. A later Mamluk governor of the city, Sanjar al-Jawli, commissioned the restoration of the Great Mosque sometime between 1311 and 1319.\nThe Mamluks rebuilt the mosque completely in 1340. In 1355, Muslim geographer Ibn Battuta noted the mosque's former existence as \"a fine Friday mosque,\" and said that al-Jawli's mosque was \"well-built.\" Inscriptions on the mosque bear the signatures of the Mamluk sultans al-Nasir Muhammad (dated 1340), Qaitbay (dated May 1498), Qansuh al-Ghawri (dated 1516), and the Abbasid caliph al-Musta'in Billah (dated 1412).\n\nOttoman period\nIn the 16th century, the mosque was restored after apparent damage in the previous century. The Ottomans commissioned its restoration and built six other mosques in the city. They had been in control of Palestine since 1517. The interior bears an inscription of the name of the Ottoman governor of Gaza, Musa Pasha, brother of deposed Husayn Pasha, dating from 1663.\n\nSome Western travelers in the late 19th century reported that the Great Mosque was the only structure in Gaza worthy of historical or architectural note. The Great Mosque was severely damaged by Allied forces while attacking the Ottoman positions in Gaza during World War I. The British claimed that Ottoman munitions were stored in the mosque which exploded in the bombardment.\n\nBritish Mandate\nUnder the supervision of former Gaza mayor Sa'id al-Shawwa, it was restored by the Supreme Muslim Council in 1926-27.\nIn 1928, the Supreme Muslim Council held a mass demonstration of Muslims and Christians at the Great Mosque in  support for boycotting elections and participation in the Legislative Assembly of the British Mandate of Palestine government. To increase the number of people in the rally, they ordered all the mosques in one of Gaza's quarters to temporarily close.\n\nPost-1948\nThe ancient inscriptions and bas-relief of Jewish religious symbols were chiseled away intentionally between 1973 and 1993. During the  Battle of Gaza between the Palestinian organizations of Hamas and Fatah, the mosque's pro-Hamas imam Mohammed al-Rafati was shot dead by Fatah gunmen on 12 June 2007, in retaliation for the killing of an official of Mahmoud Abbas's presidential guard by Hamas earlier that day.\nIn 2019–2020, 211 manuscripts in the library's collection were digitised.\nThe mosque was heavily damaged, with some sources describing it as destroyed, by Israeli bombardment during the Gaza war. Photographs show the central section of the mosque fully collapsed, with its minaret partially toppled. After the 2025 Ceasefire agreement in January, Palestinians near the area started to restore the mosque. As of 28 May 2025, UNESCO confirmed that the mosque was one of more than 100 cultural properties with preliminary damage, assessed on satellite imagery.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Great Mosque has an area of 4,100 square metres (44,000 sq ft). Most of the general structure is constructed from local marine sandstone known as kurkar. The mosque forms a large sahn (\"courtyard\") surrounded by rounded arches. The Mamluks, and later the Ottomans, had the south and southeastern sides of the building expanded.\nOver the door of the mosque is an inscription containing the name of Mamluk sultan Qalawun and there are also inscriptions containing the names of the sultans Lajin and Barquq.\n\nInterior\nWhen the building was transformed from a church into a mosque, most of the previous Crusader construction was completely replaced, but the mosque's facade with its arched western entrance is a typical piece of Crusader ecclesiastical architecture, and columns within the mosque compound still retain their Italian Gothic style. One of the columns was reused from an ancient synagogue.\nInternally, the wall surfaces are plastered and painted. Marble is used for the western door and the western facade's oculus. The floors are covered with glazed tiles. The columns are also made of marble and their capitals are built in Corinthian style.\nThe central nave is groin-vaulted, each bay being separated from one another by pointed transverse arches with rectangular profiles. The nave arcades are carried on cruciform piers with an engaged column on each face, sitting on a raised plinth. The two aisles of the mosque are also groin-vaulted. Ibn Battuta noted that the Great Mosque had a white marble minbar (\"pulpit\"); it still exists today. There is a small mihrab in the mosque with an inscription dating from 1663, containing the name of Musa Pasha, a governor of Gaza during Ottoman rule.\n\nMinaret\nThe mosque is well known for its minaret, which is square-shaped in its lower half and octagonal in its upper half, typical of Mamluk architectural style. The minaret is constructed of stone from the base to the upper, hanging balcony, including the four-tiered upper half.  The pinnacle is mostly made of woodwork and tiles, and is frequently renewed. A simple cupola springs from the octagonal stone drum and is of light construction similar to most mosques in the Levant. The minaret stands on what was the end of the eastern bay of the Crusader church. Its three semicircular apses were transformed into the base of the minaret.\n\nSee also\nAttacks on religious sites during the Israeli invasion of Gaza\nConversion of non-Islamic places of worship into mosques\nDestruction of cultural heritage during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip\nIslam in Palestine\nList of archaeological sites in the Gaza Strip\nList of churches in Palestine\nChurch of Saint Porphyrius, second Crusader-built church in Gaza\nList of mosques in Palestine\nSayed al-Hashim Mosque, Gaza\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nFurther reading\nOsheroff, Eli; Halevy, Dotan (2019), \"Destruction as Layered Event: Twentieth Century Ruins in the Great Mosque of Gaza\", International Journal of Islamic Architecture, 8 (1): 45–69, doi:10.1386/ijia.8.1.45_1, ISSN 2045-5895\n\nExternal links\n\nPalestinians pray in the Great Omari Mosque in Gaza Archived 2013-10-20 at the Wayback Machine Ma'an News Agency.",

Located in the Zaytun Quarter of the Old City of Gaza, it is named after the 5th-century bishop of Gaza, Saint Porphyrius, whose tomb is situated in the northeastern corner of the church.\nOn 19 October 2023, during the Gaza war, a building from the church compound was damaged during an Israeli airstrike, killing 18 Palestinian civilians, but the church building itself was not damaged.\n\nHistory\nSaint Porphyrius of Gaza\nThe  Patriarch of Jerusalem appointed Saint Porphyrius (c. 347–420), when he was aged 45, as custodian of the  Venerable Wood of the Cross of the Lord. He was described by the Roman Christian hagiographer Mark the Deacon, Porphyrius' companion from 395 until 420, as the Christianizer of the \"disobedient pagan people of Gaza.\" According to the legend, there was a terrible drought in Gaza that ended only after Saint Porphyrios and a group of 280 Christians prayed to God with \"fasting, vigil and procession.\" This led to the conversion of 25 pagans, as rain in this region was considered God's greatest gift.\n\nThe Byzantine- and Crusader-period churches\nA church was built on the site as early as AD 425, and was  converted into a mosque in the 7th century.\nThe current church was built by the Crusaders in the 1150s or 1160s; they probably dedicated it to St Porphyrius as well. Records from the 15th century however show that the church was also dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\nThe church was renovated in 1856.\n\nGaza wars\nIn the 2014 Gaza War, around 2,000 Palestinians slept in the church compound during Israeli bombings.\nThe church premises were again used as refuge for hundreds of civilians during the Gaza war, which started on October 7, 2023. On 19 October 2023, it was the site of an airstrike by the Israeli Air Force, which hit two halls sheltering Gazan Palestinian Muslims and Christians, causing the collapse of at least one building, and killed 18 civilians. Over 450 Palestinians had been sheltering there. A church annex was targeted again in July 2024.\n\nDescription\nThe church pavement is far below ground level (1.8 meters (5.9 ft) in its southern part, and 3 meters (9.8 ft) on the northern side), suggesting that the present building was built atop of an earlier church structure. There are some cornices and bases that date back to the  Crusader period, but much of the other portions are later additions.\n\nThe church is rectangular in shape, with a half-dome roof over the altar apse. It consists of a single aisle made up of two groin-vaulted bays, with a projecting semi-circular apse preceded by a barrel-vaulted  presbytery. Internally, the building measures 22.9 meters (75 ft) by 8.9 meters (29 ft), including the apse. It has architectural and constructional similarities with the Crusader-period former Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist (currently the Great Mosque of Gaza).\nThe church has three entrances. The main entrance is at the western façade and has a portico with three marble columns supporting two pointed arches. The column bases date to the Crusader period. A second entrance passes through the former medieval window on the southern side of the west bay, enlarged to become a door opening onto a women's gallery added in the modern period, equipped with stairs for going down to the level of the pavement. The third entrance, which  offers access from the north side toward the eastern bay, seems to also be of recent date in its current form, probably dating to the 1856 restoration, but retains several medieval elements.\n\nThe thick-walled structure is supported by horizontal marble and granite columns and pilasters.\n\nSee also\nDestruction of cultural heritage during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip\nGaza Baptist Church,  Protestant church of Gaza City\nHoly Family Church, Gaza,  Latin Catholic church of Gaza City\nList of archaeological sites in the Gaza Strip\nList of oldest church buildings\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n Media related to Saint Porphyrius Church (Gaza City) at Wikimedia Commons\n\nÉglise Saint-Porphyre (in French), part of Gaza, inventaire d’un patrimoine bombardé",

          "content": "Silwan or Siloam (Arabic: سلوان, romanized: Silwan; Greek: Σιλωάμ, romanized: Siloam; Hebrew: כְּפַר הַשִּׁילוֹחַ, romanized: Kfar ha-Shiloaḥ) is a predominantly Palestinian district in East Jerusalem, on the southeastern outskirts of the current Old City of Jerusalem.\nIt is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament; in the latter it is the location of Jesus' healing the man blind from birth. Medieval Silwan began as a farming village, dating back to the 7th century according to local traditions, while the earliest mention of the village is from the year 985. From the 19th century onwards, the village was slowly being incorporated into Jerusalem until it became an urban neighborhood.\nAfter the 1948 war, the village came under Jordanian rule. Jordanian rule lasted until the 1967 Six-Day War, since which it has been occupied by Israel. Silwan is administered as part of the Jerusalem Municipality.\nIn 2016,  Haaretz reported that the Israeli government and the  settler organization Ateret Cohanim were working together to evict Palestinians living on property classified as heqdesh,  especially in the Batn al-Hawa area of Silwan.\nDepending on how the neighborhood is defined, the Palestinian residents in Silwan number 20,000 to 50,000 while there are about 500 to 2,800 Jews.\n\nGeography\nSilwan is located southwest of the Old City Walls and constitutes part of the Jerusalem's \"Holy Basin\". The neighborhood has a narrow shape on a north-to-south axis. It is bounded by  Wadi Hilweh and Abu Tor to the west and the Ras al-Amud neighborhood to east. Its southern tip touches the Jabel Mukaber neighborhood and its northern tip touches the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery.\nBuilt on the southern ridge of the Mount of Olives, Silwan slopes steeply from approximately 700–600 metres (2,300–2,000 ft) above sea level, until it reaches the Kidron Valley, which bounds it in the west. The historical core lies  is in the northwestern section, considered to be the site of ancient Jerusalem. Dozens of ancient burial tombs attributed to the time of ancient Israel and Judah as well as the Byzantine rule were found there. Arab villagers used the tombs as dwellings or enclosures for livestock. Many of the burial tombs are inhabited until today. The village was built next to numerous water sources of historical importance, such as the Pool of Siloam (Ain Silwan), Gihon Spring and Ein Rogel. The rest of the village was built in the 19th century.\n\nHistory\nIron Age\nIn the ancient period, the area where the village stands was occupied by the necropolis of the Biblical kingdom. In the valley below, according to the Hebrew Bible, \"the waters of Shiloah go softly\" (from the Gihon Spring; Isaiah 8:6) and \"the Pool of Siloam\" (Nehemiah 3:15) to water what since King Solomon became known as the king's garden (Jeremiah 39:4; 52:7; 2 Kings 25:4; Nehemiah 3:15).\nThe necropolis, or ancient cemetery, is an archaeological site of major significance. It contains fifty rock-cut tombs of distinguished calibre, assumed to be the burial places of the highest-ranking officials of the Judean kingdom. Tomb inscriptions are in Hebrew. One of the ancient rock-cut tombs in Silwan is  known as the Tomb of Pharaoh's daughter. Another notable tomb, called the Tomb of the Royal Steward is now incorporated into a modern-period house. The ancient inscription states that it was the final resting place of \"\"...yahu who is over the house.\" The first part of the Hebrew name is effaced, but refers to a Judean royal steward or chamberlain. The inscription \nis now in the collection of the British Museum.\nAt their first thorough archaeological investigation, all of the tombs were long since emptied, and their contents removed. A great deal of destruction was done to the tombs over the centuries by Roman-period quarrying and later by their conversion for use as housing, both by monks in the Byzantine period, when some were used as churches, and later by Muslim villagers \"...when the Arab village was built; tombs were destroyed, incorporated in houses or turned into water cisterns and sewage dumps.\"\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, Siloam was built around the \"serpent-stone\", Zoheleth, where Adonijah gave his feast in the time of Solomon.\n\nThe Siloam inscription was discovered in the water tunnel built during the reign of Hezekiah, in the early 7th century BC. The Siloam inscription is now preserved in the Archeological Museum of Istanbul, Turkey. Another important inscription found at Siloam is the lintel of Shebna-yahu's tomb (known as the Shebna Inscription), which is in the collections of the British Museum. In 2004, archaeologists excavating the site for the Israel Antiquities Authority found biblical-era coins marked with ancient Hebrew writing, pottery shards and a stone bottle cork that confirmed the identification of the site as the biblical Siloam Pool.\n\nRoman period\nThe King's Garden was used as a staging area for Jewish pilgrims who, during the festivals of Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot, used the spring-fed Pool of Siloam to wash and ritually purify themselves before ascending the monumental stepped street to the Temple Mount while singing hymns based on Psalms. On Sukkot water was brought from the Pool of Siloam to the Temple and poured upon the altar and the priests also drank of this water.\nIn the New Testament, the collapse of the Tower of Siloam is cited by Jesus as one of two examples where sudden, untimely death came to people who didn't necessarily deserve it more than most other sinful people.\nAccording to the Gospel of John, Jesus healed a man who had been blind from birth. Jesus spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and spread the mud over the blind man's eyes. He then told the man, \"Go wash yourself in the Pool of Siloam.\" So the man went and washed and came back seeing.\nJosephus described the waters of Siloam as \"sweet and abundant\". During the general outbreak of hostilities between the Jewish nation and the Roman Imperial army in ca. 66 CE, Simon bar Giora controlled all of the \"Upper City\" where he made his place of residence in the Phasael tower before abandoning it, and part of the \"Lower City\" (Acra) as far as the great wall in the Kidron Valley and the fountain of Siloam, now in Silwan.\n\nByzantine period\nA pool and church were built at Siloam by the Byzantine empress Eudocia (c. 400–460 CE) to commemorate Jesus' miraculous healing of the blind.\n\nEarly Muslim period\nLocal folklore dates Silwan to the arrival of the second Rashidun caliph, Umar ibn al-Khattab from Arabia. According to one resident's version of the story, the Greeks were so impressed that the Caliph entered on foot while his servant rode on a camel that they presented him with the key to the city. The Caliph thereafter granted the wadi to \"Khan Silowna,\" an agricultural community of cave dwellers living in ancient rock-cut tombs along the face of the eastern ridge.\nIn medieval Muslim tradition, the spring of Silwan (Ayn Silwan) was among the four most sacred water sources in the world. The others were Zamzam in Mecca, Ayn Falus in Beisan and Ayn al-Baqar in Acre. Silwan is mentioned as \"Sulwan\" by the 10th-century Arab writer and traveller al-Muqaddasi. In his 985 book he noted that (as rendered in the edition by Le Strange) \"The village of Sulwan is a place on the outskirts of the city [Jerusalem]. Below the village of 'Ain Sulwan (Spring of Siloam), of fairly good water, which irrigates the large gardens which were given in bequest (Waqf) by the Khalif 'Othman ibn 'Affan for the poor of the city. Lower down than this, again, is Job's Well (Bir Ayyub). It is said that on the Night of 'Arafat the water of  the holy well Zamzam, at Makkah, comes underground to the water of the Spring (of Siloam). The people hold a festival here on that evening.\"\nMoshe Gil interprets statements by Muqaddasi (writing in 985), Nasir-i Khusraw (1047), and Yaqut (1225), as meaning that what they called the Spring of Silwan can only be a water source located at quite a distance farther south, Khusraw actually indicating a distance of c. 3 km from Jerusalem's walls. This leads to Gil identifying this \"Spring of Silwan\" with what we know today as the Spring of Bir Ayyub (biblical Ein Rogel), whose exact location in those days cannot be pinpointed anymore, but was in any case several km away from the city walls.\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1596, Ayn Silwan appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Quds of the Liwa of Quds, with a population of 60 households, all Muslim. They paid a total of 35,500 akçe in taxes, and all of the revenues went to a Waqf.\nIn 1834, during a large-scale peasants' rebellion against Ibrahim Pasha, thousands of rebels infiltrated Jerusalem through ancient underground sewage channels leading to the farm fields of the village of Silwan. A traveller to Palestine in 1883, T. Skinner, wrote that the olive groves near Silwan were a gathering place for Muslims on Fridays.\nIn 1838 Silwan was noted as a Muslim village, part of el-Wadiyeh district, located east of Jerusalem.\nA photograph of the village taken between 1853 and 1857 by James Graham can be found on page 35 of Picturing Jerusalem by photographers James Graham and Mendel Diness. It shows the western part of the modern village as empty of habitations, a few trees are scattered across the southern ridge with the small village confined to the ridgetop east of the valley.\nIn the mid-1850s, the villagers of Silwan were paid £100 annually by the Jews in an effort to prevent the desecration of graves on the Mount of Olives. Nineteenth-century travellers described the village as a robbers' lair. Charles Wilson wrote that \"the houses and the streets of Siloam, if such they may be called, are filthy in the extreme.\" Charles Warren depicted the population as a lawless set, credited with being \"the most unscrupulous ruffians in Palestine.\"\nAn official Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Silwan had a total of 92 houses and a population of 240, though the population count included only men.\nIn 1883, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Silwan as a \"village perched on a precipice and badly built of stone. The waters is brought from Ain Umm ed Deraj. There are numerous caves among and behind the houses, which are used as stables by the inhabitants.\"\nModern settlement of the western ridge of the modern urban neighborhood of Silwan, called Wadi Hilweh in Arabic and dubbed in 1920 \"the City of David\" by Jewish-French archaeologist de:Raymond Weill (1874–1950), began in 1873–1874, when the Meyuchas family moved out of the Old City to a new home on the ridge.\nIn books published between 1888 and 1911, travellers describe the valley floor as verdant and cultivated, with the stony village perched along the top of the eastern ridge hillside. Explorer Gustaf Dalman (1855–1941) describes the manner in which the villagers of Silwan irrigated their vegetable crop which they planted on terraces. The village of Silwan was located on the eastern slope of the Kidron Valley, above the outlet of the Gihon Spring opposite Wadi Hilweh. The villagers cultivated the arable land in the Kidron Valley, which in biblical tradition formed the king's gardens during the Davidic dynasty, to grow vegetables for market in Jerusalem.\nBetween 1885 and 1891, 45 new stone houses were built for a Yemenite Jewish community in what is now the Batn al-Hawa area of Silwan.  The neighbourhood included a place of worship now known as the Old Yemenite Synagogue.\nIn 1896 the population of Silwan was estimated to be about 939 persons.\n\nBritish Mandate\nAt the time of the 1922 census of Palestine, \"Selwan (Kfar Hashiloah)\" had a population of 1,901 persons; 1,699 Muslims, 153 Jews and 49 Christians, where the Christians were 16 Roman Catholics and 33 Syrian Catholics. In the same year, Baron Edmond de Rothschild bought several acres of land there and transferred it to the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association. By the time of the 1931 census, Silwan had 630 occupied houses and a population of 2968; 2,553 Muslims, 124 Jews and 91 Christians (the last including the Latin, Greek and St. Stephens convents).\nIn the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, the Yemenite community was removed from Silwan by the Welfare Bureau of the Va'ad Leumi into the Jewish Quarter as security conditions for Jews worsened, and in 1938, the remaining Yemenite Jews in Silwan were evacuated by the Jewish Community Council on the advice of the police. According to documents in the custodian office and real estate and project advancement expert Edmund Levy, the homes of the Yemenite Jews were occupied by Arab families without registering ownership.\n\nThe British Mandatory government began annexing parts of Silwan to the Jerusalem Municipality, a process completed by the final Jordanian annexation of remaining Silwan in 1952.\n\nIn the twentieth century, Silwan grew northward towards Jerusalem, expanding from a small farming village into an urban neighborhood. Modern Arab Silwan encompasses Old Silwan (generally to the south), the Yemenite village (to the north), and the once-vacant land between. Today Silwan follows the ridge of the southern peak of the Mount of Olives to the east of the Kidron Valley, from the ridge west of the Ophel up to the southern wall of the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif.\nIn the 1945 statistics the population of Silwan was 3,820; 3,680 Muslims and 140 Christians, with a total of 5,421 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, Arabs used 58 dunams for plantations and irrigable land and 2,498 for cereals, while Jews used 51 for cereals. A total of 172 dunams were classified as built-up (urban) land.\n\nJordanian period\nAfter the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Silwan came under Jordanian administration along with the rest of the West Bank, and land there owned by Jews was managed by the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property. It remained under Jordanian rule until 1967, when Israel captured the Old City and surrounding region. Until then, the village had delegates in the Jerusalem City Council.\n\nDisplacement of Palestinians\nSince the 1967 Six-Day War Silwan has been under Israeli occupation, and Jewish organizations have sought to re-establish a Jewish presence there. The Ir David Foundation and the Ateret Cohanim organizations are promoting resettlement of Jews in the neighborhood in cooperation with the Committee for the Renewal of the Yemenite Village in Shiloah.\nIn 1987, the Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations wrote to the Secretary-General to inform him of Israeli settlement activity; his letter noted that an Israeli company had taken over two Palestinian houses in the neighborhood of al-Bustan, after evicting their occupants, claiming the houses were its property. Wadi Hilweh, an area of Silwan close to the southern wall of the Old City, and its neighborhood of al-Bustan, has been ever since a focus of Jewish settlement.\n\nJewish settlements\nIn 1991, a movement was formed to promote Jewish settlement in Silwan. Some Silwan properties had already been declared absentee property in the 1980s, and suspicions arose that a number of claims filed by Jewish organizations had been accepted by the Custodian without any site visits or follow-up. Property in Silwan has been purchased by Jews through indirect sales, some by invoking the Absentee Property Law. In other cases, the Jewish National Fund signed protected tenant agreements that enabled construction to proceed without a tender process.\nAs of 2004, more than 50 Jewish families live in the area, some in homes acquired from Arabs who claim they did not know they were selling their homes to Jews, some in Beit Yonatan.\nIn 2003, Ateret Cohanim built a seven-storey apartment building known as Beit Yonatan (named for Jonathan Pollard) without a permit. In 2007, the courts ordered the eviction of the residents, but the building was approved retroactively. In 2008 a plan was submitted for a building complex including a synagogue, 10 apartments, a kindergarten, a library and underground parking for 100 cars in a location 200 meters from the Old City walls.\nRabbis for Human Rights-North America, which changed its name to T'ruah in 2012, accused Elad of creating a \"method of expelling citizens from their properties, appropriating public areas, enclosing these lands with fences and guards, and banning the entrance of the local residents...under the protection of a private security force.\" Approximately 1,500 supporters of RHR-NA/T'ruah wrote to Russell Robinson, CEO of JNF-US, to demand an end to the eviction of a Silwan family.\nOvernight on September 30, 2014, at 1:30 am, settlers, supported by police officers and reportedly connected to the Ir David Foundation, commonly known as Elad, entered 25 houses in 7 buildings which previously belonged to several Palestinian families in the neighborhood, in what was the largest Israeli purchase of homes in Silwan since 1986. Most were vacant, but in one house where a family was evicted a confrontation broke out. Details concerning the process whereby the properties were purchased are lacking, but Palestinian middle men appear to be involved, buying the six houses, and then selling them to a private American company, Kendall Finance. Elad stated that the houses had been bought properly and legally. Advertisements were posted on Facebook offering Jewish ex-army veterans $140 a day to sit in the properties until families move in. As those who sell land to Israelis may be sentenced to death by the PA, the son of one Palestinian family who sold his property has fled Jerusalem, in fear for his life. Some of the Palestinian families claiming ownership intended to get the settlers out by taking legal steps.\nIn response to this move, on October 2, 2014, the European Union condemned settlement expansion in Silwan. White House spokesman Josh Earnest, in a condemnation of the takeover, described the new occupants as \"individuals who are associated with an organization whose agenda, by definition, stokes tensions between Israelis and Palestinians.\" Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was \"baffled\" by US criticism, deeming it \"un-American\" to criticize the legal purchase of homes in East Jerusalem to either Jews or Arabs.\nOn June 15, 2016, Jerusalem's City Hall approved the construction of a three-storey residential house for Jews wishing to make Silwan their home.\nA ruling handed down by the Jerusalem Magistrats Court in January 2020 gave a substantial boost to efforts by the settler organization Ateret Cohanim to evict large numbers of Palestinians in Silwan from their homes. The organization managed to take over control of an Ottoman era (19th century) Jewish trust, called the Benvenisti Trust after Rabbi Moshe Benvenisti, and claims that land in areas of Silwan, such as the Batan al-Hawa neighborhood, was 'sacred religious land' and that Palestinians residing on this trust land were illegal squatters. The decisions are thought to effectively threaten with displacement some 700 Palestinians in Silwan.\n\nThe Sumreen (or Sumarin) family\nThe house where the family lives is in the middle of an area designated by Israel as \"the City of David National Park.\" where a right-wing, pro-settler organization, Elad, runs an archaeological and biblical theme park known as City of David.\nIn December 2011, a board member of the Jewish National Fund's US fundraising arm resigned in protest after a 20-year legal process came to a head with an order for the eviction of a Palestinian family from a JNF-owned home. The home had been acquired via the Absentee Property Law. Several days before the order was carried out, JNF announced it would be delayed.\nIn 2011 the verdict was overturned. In 2017, the claim was successfully renewed. In September 2019, the Sumreen family lost an appeal and appealed to the District Court. In June 2020, the appeal was rejected. After criticism from many directions the JNF has asked for a rehearing of the proceedings. In August, the eviction process was suspended. JNF and Elad are in disagreement over the process.\nOn 9 January 2022, following receipt of an opinion stating \"there is no objection to the expulsion\" from Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, a decision by the Supreme Court is awaited.\nOn 3 April 2023, the Supreme Court ruled against eviction and that the JNF's subsidiary Heimanuta must pay compensation of 20,000 shekels ($5,560).\n\nHousing demolition and construction permits\nIn 2005, the Israeli government planned to demolish 88 Arab homes in al-Bustan neighborhood built without permits but they were not found illegal in a municipal court.\nAccording to the State Comptroller's report, there were 130 illegal structures in Silwan in 2009, a tenfold increase since 1967. When enforcement of the building code began in al-Bustan in 1995, thirty illegal structures were found, mostly old residential buildings. By 2004, the number of illegal structures rose to 80. The municipality launched legal proceedings against 43 and demolished 10, but these were soon replaced by new buildings.\nThe group Ir Amim argues that the illegal construction is due to insufficient granting of permits by the Jerusalem municipality. They say that under Israeli administration, fewer than 20 permits, mainly minor, were issued for this part of Silwan, and that as a result, most building in this part of Silwan and the whole neighborhood generally lack permits. They also say that as of 2009, the vast majority of buildings in the neighborhood were built without permits, in particular in al-Bustan. In 2010, Ir Amim's petition to halt a municipal zoning plan for the City of David area was rejected. The plan does not call for demolition of illegal construction, but rather regulates where construction may continue. The group said that the plan favored the interests of Elad and the neighborhood's Jewish residents, while Elad said that the plan allotted only 15 percent of construction to Jews versus 85 percent to Arab residents. The mukhtar of Silwan objected to Ir Amim's petition against the plan. \"We have said that there are good aspects of the plan and there are bad aspects of the plan, we're still working it all out. But to come and say that the whole plan is bad, and to ask that it be done away with, then what have you accomplished? Nothing.\"\n\nTorching of olive trees\nIn May 2010, a group of Israeli settlers torched \"an 11-Dunam olive orchard in al-Rababa valley, in Silwan, south of the Old City of Jerusalem\" which included the destruction of three olive trees that were over 300 years old. In a 2011 New York Times article, these attacks were called \"price tag\" attacks.\n\nDemography\nThe Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem by the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies put the number of residents to 19,050 in 2012. However, the Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem are difficult to define, in contrast to the Jewish neighborhoods, because dense construction has blurred older boundaries and Silwan is now merged with Ras al-Amud, Jabel Mukaber and Abu Tor. The Palestinian residents in Silwan number 20,000 to 50,000 while there are fewer than 700 Jews.\n\nPalestinian cultural activities\nThe Silwan Ta'azef Music School opened in October 2007. Since November 2007, an art program, language courses for women, men and children, leadership training for teenage girls, cooking classes, an embroidery club and swimming classes have opened in Silwan. In 2009, a local library was established. The Silwan theater group is led by a professional actress from Bethlehem. Many of these activities take place at the Madaa Silwan Creative Center.\n\nArchaeology\nSilwan necropolis\nA part of Silwan was built around and above the Silwan necropolis, a series of rock-cut structures originally used as Iron Age tombs, but repurposed for various uses over the millennia.\n\nWadi Hilweh\nThe ridge to the west of Silwan, part of the Wadi Hilweh Arab neighbourhood and known as the City of David in archaeological and tourism contexts, is believed to be the original Bronze Age and Iron Age site of Jerusalem.  Archaeological exploration began in the 19th century. Vacant during most of the Ottoman period, Jewish and Arab settlement began in the late 19th century.\nThe National-Religious Jewish settlers' organisation, ElAd, was accused of excavating on Palestinian property and beginning its work on the City of David tunnels before receiving a permit from the Jerusalem Municipality.\nThe general area was thought by many historical geographers to be that of Josephus' Acra, so-named after an old fortress that was once there, an area also called the \"Lower City.\"\nIn 2007, archaeologists unearthed under a parking lot a 2,000-year-old mansion that may have belonged to Queen Helene of Adiabene. The building includes storerooms, living quarters and ritual baths.\nIn 2008, Islamic-era skeletons discovered in the course of excavations have disappeared.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\nAncient Silwan (Shiloah) Siloam in Israel and The City of David\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 17:   IAA, Wikimedia commons\nSilwan & Ath Thuri (Fact Sheet) Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem, ARIJ\nAerial photo, ARIJ\nSilwan (Shiloah) in Antiquity Archaeological Survey of Israel\nEast Jerusalem: 'Every action in this area is very sensitive' – video, The Guardian\nEast Jerusalem: Witnessing the truth – video, The Guardian\nHome Demolition and Forced Displacement in Silwan, The Civic Coalition for Palestinian Rights in Jerusalem\nA City Divided: Jerusalem's Most Contested Neighborhood, Vice News\nOverview of the Yemenite Village Adjacent to the Gihon Spring, by Ateret Cohanim\nWadi Hilweh Information Center",

Jordanian rule lasted until the 1967 Six-Day War, since which it has been occupied by Israel. Silwan is administered as part of the Jerusalem Municipality.\nIn 2016,  Haaretz reported that the Israeli government and the  settler organization Ateret Cohanim were working together to evict Palestinians living on property classified as heqdesh,  especially in the Batn al-Hawa area of Silwan.\nDepending on how the neighborhood is defined, the Palestinian residents in Silwan number 20,000 to 50,000 while there are about 500 to 2,800 Jews.",

          "content": "Lifta (Arabic: لفتا; Hebrew: ליפתא) was a Palestinian village on the outskirts of Jerusalem. The village's Palestinian Arab inhabitants were expelled by Zionist paramilitary forces during the 1948 Palestine war.\nDuring the Ottoman period, the village was recorded to have a population of 400 Arabs, all Muslim households. In 1834, a battle took place in the village during the Palestinian Peasants' Revolt. A British 1922 census registered Lifta's population at 1,451, all Muslims.\nPrior to 1948, the village had orchards, several olive presses, a winepress, in addition to a modern clinic, two coffeehouses, two carpentry shops, barbershops, a butcher, and a mosque. In the 1945 statistics the population of Lifta was 2,250; 2,230 Muslims and 20 Christians. In addition, a small number of Jews resided in the village, and one former Jewish inhabitant described the relationship her family and the Palestinian Arab majority as 'excellent'.\nDuring the 1948 Palestine war, a massacre occurred on 28 December 1947, when a Jewish militia launched a machine-gun and grenade assault on a cafe in Lifa. The mukhtar's home was also incinerated by the Zionist forces and 20 buildings were blown up as the village was put under siege. The village's Palestinian Arab inhabitants were expelled, and the abandoned village was later repopulated by Jewish immigrants until the 1970s. In July 2017, Israel declared Lifta (called Mei Neftoach) as a national nature reserve. It has been referred to as the \"Palestinian Pompeii\".\n\nHistory\nAntiquity\nA perennial spring located in the channel's upper section is believed to be the site where the village first developed. Surrounding this spring, artifacts including a burial cave and pottery shards from the Middle Bronze Age II and Iron Age II periods were uncovered.\nArchaeological remains dating as far back as Iron Age II have been found in the village.\n\nBiblical identification\nThe site is considered by some to be identical with biblical Hebrew: מי נפתוח Mei Neftoach. It was populated since ancient times; \"Nephtoah\" (Hebrew: נפתח, lit. spring of the corridor) is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as the border between the Israelite tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and was the northernmost demarcation point of the territory of the Tribe of Judah. Other scholars hold the identification to be plausible but by no means certain. Kitchener and Conder found the identification with Nephtoah unsatisfactory, and preferred to identify Lifta with Eleph of Benjamin (Joshua 18:28).\n\nRoman and Byzantine periods\nThe Romans and Byzantines called it Nephtho, and the Crusaders referred to it as Clepsta.\n\nCrusader period\nThe remains of a court-yard home from the Crusader period remains in the centre of the village.\n\nOttoman era\nIn 1596, Lifta was a village in the Ottoman Empire, nahiya (subdistrict) of Jerusalem under the liwa' (district) of Jerusalem, and it had a population 72 Muslim households, an estimated  396 persons. It paid taxes on wheat, barley, olives, fruit orchards and vineyards; a total of 4,800  akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf.\nIn 1834, a battle took place here, during the revolt of that year. The Egyptian Ibrahim Pasha and his army fought and defeated local rebels, led by Shaykh Qasim al-Ahmad, a prominent local ruler. However, the Qasim al-Ahmad family remained powerful and ruled the region southwest of Nablus from their fortified villages of Deir Istiya and Bayt Wazan some 40 kilometers (25 mi) due north of Lifta. In 1838 Edward Robinson noted  Lifta  as a Muslim village, located in the Beni Malik area, west of Jerusalem. Robinson hired muleteers from Lifta, noting that in Lifta \"every peasant keeps his mule and usually accompanies it\".\nIn 1863 Victor Guérin described Lifta as being surrounded by gardens of lemon-trees, oranges, figs, pomegranates, alms and apricots. An Ottoman village list of about 1870 indicated 117 houses and a population of 395, though the population count included men, only.\nThe PEF's Survey of Western Palestine in 1883 described it as a village on the side of a steep hill, with a spring and rock-cut tombs to the south.\nIn 1896 the population of Lifta was estimated to be about 966 persons.\nIn 1907 the German historian Gustav Rothstein was invited to Lifta by his Arabic language teacher, Elias Nasrallah Haddad. Rothstein wrote a 20-pages article describing the marriage celebrations and religious festivals in Lifta.\n\nBritish Mandate era\nIn 1917, Lifta surrendered to the British forces with white flags and, as a symbolic gesture, the keys to the village.\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine, Lifta had a population 1,451, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census (when Lifta was counted with \"Shneller's Quarter\"), to 1,893; 1,844 Muslims, 35 Jews and 14 Christians, in a total of 410 houses.\nDuring the 1929 Palestine riots, according to one Israeli source, some villagers from Lifta were among gangs that  participated in a number of robberies and attacks on nearby Jewish communities.\n\nIn the 1945 statistics the population of Lifta was 2,250; 2,230 Muslims and 20 Christians, and the total land area was 8,743 dunams, according to an official land and population survey. 3,248 dunams were for cereals, while 324 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\n\nPrior to 1948, the village, with a population of some 2,500 people, had orchards, several olive presses, a winepress, in addition to a modern clinic, two coffeehouses, two carpentry shops, barbershops, a butcher, and a mosque. A small number of Jews resided in the village, and one former Jewish inhabitant described the relationship her family and the Palestinian majority as 'excellent'.\n\n1948 war and depopulation\nIn the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine Lifta, Romema, and Shaykh Badr which were strategically located on the road leaving Jerusalem to Tel-Aviv, were an operational priority for Jewish forces.  Some families had already left the village after a decision had been made  somewhat earlier on 4 December, to evacuate its women and children, in order to host a military company, and on 4 December 1947 some Arab families left. By mid-December irregular Arab militia took up positions in Lifta to defend the site. Hagannah patrols engaged in firefights with the village militiamen while Irgun and Lehi were even more aggressive. On 28 December 1947, the village suffered from what survivors called the Lifta massacre when a Jewish militia launched a machine-gun and grenade assault on the café of Salah Eisa. In order to warn residents that they should evacuate, the mukhtar's home was incinerated, and 20 buildings blown up as the village was put under siege. The attack left seven dead, and more women and children left the village. The village was suffering from food shortages in the beginning of January. Subsequently, a number of the villagers returned home, with Benny Morris reporting \"some, or most\" doing so. Subsequently, Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, while visiting the village, ordered the women, children and elderly to evacuate and the men to stay put. On 29 January, a Lehi raid blew up 3 houses in the village. By early February the village was abandoned by the irregular militia. Benny Morris lists the cause of the depopulation of the village as being a military assault on the settlement.\nAccording to one resident, interviewed in 2021, there were are around 40,000 descendants of the original refugee population, dispersed in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Jordan and the Palestinian diaspora. Several families still retain their Ottoman period property deeds, attesting to their ownership of parts of Lifta.\n\nState of Israel\nAfter the expulsion of its Palestinian villagers, of Lifta's 410 homes, 60 stone houses, some three stories high, remained, together with its  mosque, an olive press, and a tiled pathway to a spring. It is listed by Unesco as a potential World Heritage Site, and in 2018, the World Heritage Fund registered the village among a list of 24 heritage sites that were endangered.\nLifta was used for Jewish refugee housing during the war, and following the war the Jewish Agency and the state of Israel settled Jewish immigrants from Yemen and Kurdistan in the village, totaling 300 families. However ownership of the houses was not registered in their name. Living conditions in Lifta were difficult, the buildings were in poor repair, poor roads and transport, and lack of electricity, water, and sanitation infrastructure. In 1969-71 most of the Jewish inhabitants of Lifta chose to leave as part of a compensation program by Amidar. Holes were drilled in the roofs of the evacuated buildings to make them less inhabitable, so that squatters wouldn't take up residence. 13 families, who lived in the portion of the village close to Highway 1 and didn't suffer from transportation issues chose to remain.\nIn the 1980s, Lifta was declared a municipal nature reserve under the auspices of the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.\nIn 1984, one of the abandoned buildings in the village was occupied by the \"Lifta gang\", a Jewish group plotting the blow up the mosques on the Temple Mount, who were stopped at the gates of the site with 250 pounds of explosives, hand grenades, and other armaments.\n\nFollowing the departure of the Jewish residents, some of the buildings in the village were used for Lifta drug abuse rehabilitation center for adolescents, which was closed in 2014, and from 1971 for the Lifta high school, an open education school, which relocated to German Colony, Jerusalem in 2001.\n\nIn 2011, plans were announced to demolish the village and build a luxury development consisting of 212 luxury housing units and a hotel. Former residents brought a legal petition to preserve the village as a historic site. Lifta was the last remaining Arab village that was depopulated to have not been either completely destroyed or re-inhabited.  In 2012, the  plans to rebuild the village as an upscale neighborhood were rejected by the Jerusalem District Court.\nBy 2011, three books about the Palestinian village history had been published.\nIn June 2017 the last Jewish residents left the village following a settlement with the government who acknowledged they were not squatters but rather resettled in Lifta by the appropriate authorities.\nIn July 2017 Mei Neftoach was declared a national nature reserve. 55 out of 450 pre-1948 stone houses are still standing.\nIn 2021, the Israel Land Administration, without informing beforehand the Jerusalem Municipality authorities,  announced on Jerusalem Day that it was reported to be preparing a tender for the  construction of a luxury neighborhood on the village's ruins, projected to consist of  259 villas, a hotel, and a mall. On 11 August 2022, the plan to demolish Lifta and build luxury housing was shelved, with new Jerusalem mayor Moshe Lion seeking to preserve the village of Lifta and transform it into a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The previous Mayor of Jerusalem, Israeli businessman and politician Nir Barkat, had initially approved the plan for Lifta's demolition before changing his mind, opposing the development plans after visiting the site. Currently, Lifta is still on the list of UNESCO's tentative World Heritage Sites.\n\nArchaeology\nIn 2010, an archaeological survey was conducted at Lifta by Mordechai Heiman on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA).\n\nArab traditional dress\nLifta was among the wealthiest communities in the Jerusalem area, and the women were known for their fine embroidery Thob Ghabani bridal dresses were sewn in Lifta. They were made of ghabani, a natural cotton covered with gold color silk floral embroidery produced in Aleppo, and were narrower than other dresses. The sleeves were also more tapered. The sides, sleeves and chest panel of the dress were adorned with silk insets. The dresses were ordered by brides in Bethlehem. The married women of Lifta wore a distinctive conical shaṭweh head-dress, that was also worn in Bethlehem, Ayn Karim, Beit Jala and Beit Sahour.\n\nNotable people\nRasmea Odeh\nYahya Hammuda\n\nSee also\nAli Abunimah\nList of modern names for biblical place names\nPalestinian costumes\nZochrot\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nWelcome to Lifta, palestineremembered.com; accessed 2 September 2015.\nLifta, Zochrot\n[1], The Ruins of Lifta (2016)\nIsrael Antiquities Authority, Jerusalem, Lifta, Survey (2010)\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 17: IAA, Wikimedia commons\nLifta in Antiquity Archaeological Survey of Israel\nF.A.S.T.-Lifta Preservation Joint project on the reconstruction of memory and the preservation of Lifta, archive.org, 14 May 2006.\nLifta photos by Dr Moslih Kanaaneh, jalili48.com; accessed 2 September 2015.\nLifta, by Rami Nashashibi (1996), Center for Research and Documentation of Palestinian Society.\nLifta, zochrot.org\nReturn to Lifta, 13 May 2006, zochrot.org\nLifta Society website, liftasociety.org\nLifta website, schulen.eduhi.at\n3D models of different houses in Lifta, sketchfab.com; accessed 2 September 2015.",

          "content": "Ein Karem (Hebrew: עין כרם, romanized: ʿEin Kārem; Arabic: عين كارم, romanized: ʿAyn Kārim) also Ein Kerem or Ain Karem, is a historic mountain village southwest of Jerusalem, presently a neighborhood in the outskirts of the modern city, within the Jerusalem District in Israel. It is the site of the Hadassah Medical Center.\nEin Karem was an important Jewish village during the late Second Temple period, during which it became important to Christianity. Christian tradition holds that John the Baptist was born in Ein Karem, following the biblical verse in Luke saying John's family lived in a \"town in the hill country of Judea\". Probably because of its location between Bethlehem and Jerusalem, this location was a very comfortable one for a pilgrimage, and this led to the establishment of many churches and monasteries in the area.\nDuring the years of Ottoman and later British Mandate, Ein Karem was a Palestinian Arab village. It was depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. After the war it became once again a Jewish settlement. Today, Ein Karem is a vibrant bohemian neighborhood of Jerusalem, with a population of 2,000 (2010).\nIt has retained a very high-level of authenticity, its natural environment remains intact, and its old houses are still inhabited and preserved. It attracts three million visitors a year, one-third of them pilgrims from around the world. Alongside its religious landmarks, Ein Karem is also known for its fine art, culinary, and musical scenes.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Ein Karem or Ein Kerem can be literally translated from both Hebrew and Arabic as \"Spring of the Vineyard\". It is derived from the springs and vineyards established on the village's terraced slopes.\nAnother possible translation would be \"Spring of Carem\", if derived from an ancient Iron Age Israelite city called Carem, mentioned as a city in the dominion of the tribe of Judah in the Septuagint version of Book of Joshua. In Arabic, other than meaning \"Spring of the Vineyard\", it could be understood as well as \"the Generous Spring\".\n\nHistory\nA spring that provides water to the village of Ein Karem stimulated settlement there from an early time.\n\nBronze Age\nPottery has been found near the spring dating to the Middle Bronze Age.\n\nIron Age/Israelite period\nDuring the Iron Age, or Israelite period, Ein Karem is usually identified as the location of the biblical village of Beth HaKerem (Jeremiah 6:1; Nehemiah 3:14).\n\nSecond Temple period\nA well-preserved mikveh (Jewish ritual bath) indicates there was a Jewish settlement in the Second Temple period along with some other discoveries such as handful of graves, bits of a wall, and an olive press. A reservoir here was mentioned in the Copper Scroll, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nRoman and Byzantine periods\nDuring excavations in the Church of Saint John the Baptist, a marble statue of Aphrodite (or Venus) was found, broken in two. It is believed to date from the Roman era and was probably toppled in Byzantine times. Today, the statue is at the Rockefeller Museum. Excavations in front of the same church, which has at its core the cave which Christian tradition identifies as the birthplace of John the Baptist, have unearthed remains of two Byzantine chapels, one containing an inscription mentioning Christian \"martyrs\", but without any mention of John. Ceramics from the Byzantine period have also been found in Ein Karem.\nIn the Byzantine period, as part of the establishment of the “Liturgy of Jerusalem\", Ein Karem was identified with the \"Visitation\", an event mentioned in the New Testament where Mary, expecting Jesus, encountered her cousin Elizabeth, who was pregnant with John the Baptist. Byzantine sources link Ein Karem with the residence of Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, a place not specified in the New Testament. In around 530 CE, the Christian pilgrim Theodosius places Elizabeth's town at a distance of five miles (8.0 km) from Jerusalem, which suits Ein Karem.\n\nEarly Islamic period\nEin Karem was recorded after the Islamic conquest. Al-Tamimi, the physician (d. 990),  refers to a church in Ein Karem that was venerated by Christians, and notes a particular plant he collected there.\n\nCrusader period\nIt is mentioned under the name St. Jehan de Bois, \"Saint John in the Mountains\", during the Crusades. The Crusaders were the first to build here a church dedicated to St John, rebuilt in the 17th century by the Franciscans and still active today, and Moshe Sharon considers it as \"almost sure\" that the Crusaders are the ones who started the tradition of identifying that particular site as St John's birthplace.\n\nAyyubid and Mamluk periods\nAfter conquering Jerusalem in 1187, Saladin granted the village of Ein Karem to Abu Maydan, a renowned Sufi teacher from Seville, Andalusia. Abu Madyan had fought in the 1187 Battle of Hattin against the Crusaders before returning to the Maghreb, where he eventually died in Tlemcen, in what is today Algeria. A document, drafted in Jerusalem in 1320 (720 AH) by Abu Maydan's great-grandson, outlines the waqf's holdings, beginning with Ein Karem:\"A village known by the name of Ein Karem, one of the villages adjacent to Jerusalem. This village includes farmed and fallow lands, both cultivated and abandoned, slopes and plains, unproductive bare rock, buildings in ruins, farmhouses, buildings in good repair with their surrounding fields, a little garden, pomegranate trees and other kinds irrigated with water from springs on the property, olive trees of a “rumi” or western variety, carob trees, fig trees, sessile oaks, qiqebs (hardwoods). This village is bounded on all sides: to the south by the great Maliha (salt pan); to the north by properties belonging to Ein-Kaout, Qalunya, Harash, Sataf, and Zawiya el-Bakhtyari; to the west by Ein Esheshqqaq, and to the east by properties belonging to the Maliha and to Beit Mazmil. This village is established as a waqf, with all attendant rights, appurtenances, fields, cultivated lands, threshing floors, loamy earth, with freshwater springs on location, prairies, planted trees, disused wells, vineyards, in a word, with all rights relating thereto, both within and without. However, the mosque, house of God, the path and the cemetery intended for use by Muslims, are not included in the present waqf.\"The Waqf Abu Maydan endowment, which included the Mughrabi Quarter in Jerusalem, has been supported by agricultural and property revenues from the village of Ein Karem until the 1948 war.\nA coin from the reign of As-Salih Hajji (1389 CE) was found here, together with pottery, glassware and other coins from the Mamluk era.\n\nOttoman period\nMost of the village – some 15,000 dunams – was waqf land set aside charitably to benefit the Moroccan Muslim community in Jerusalem, belonging to the endowment established by Abu Madyan in the 14th century.\nIn 1517, the village was included in the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine and in the 1596 tax-records it appeared as 'Ain Karim, located in the Nahiya of Jabal Quds of the Liwa of Al-Quds. The village had at this time 29 households, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, which included wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards, grape syrup/molasse, goats and beehives in addition to \"occasional revenues\"; a total of 5,300 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf.\nIn the course 17th century, the Franciscans manage to recover the ruins of the church raised by the Crusaders over the traditional birth cave of St. John and, in spite of local Muslim opposition, to rebuild and fortify it as the Monastery of St. John in the Mountains.\nIsraeli geographer Yehoshua Ben-Arieh described Ein Karem as \"the most important village west of Jerusalem\" in the 19th century.\nJames Silk Buckingham visited in the early 1800s, and found he was \"more pleased with this village [...] than with any other place I had yet visited in Palestine.\"\nIn 1838, Ain Karim was noted as a Muslim and Latin Christian village in the Beni Hasan district.\nIn 1863 Victor Guérin noted a thousand inhabitants \"of whom there are barely two hundred and fifty who are Catholics; the others are Muslim.\" The ancestors of the latter were held to descend from Maghrabins, that is to say, originating from the Maghreb (North Africa). Guérin describes them as rowdy and fanatical, until a few years before his visit having very often attacked the Catholic monks at the Monastery of St John in order to extort from them food and money, a habit that had subsided only lately.\nAn official Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Ain Karim had 178 houses and a population of 533, though the population count included only men. The population consisted of 412 Muslims in 138 houses, 66 Latin Christians in 18 houses, and 55 Greek Christians in 12 houses.\nIn 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Ain Karim as: \"A flourishing village of about 600 inhabitants, 100 being Latin Christians. It stands on a sort of natural terrace projecting from the higher hills on the east of it, with a broad flat valley below on the west. On the south below the village is a fine spring ('Ain Sitti Miriam), with a vaulted place for prayer over it. The water issues from a spout into a trough.\"\nIn 1896 the population of 'Ain Karim was estimated to be about 1,290 persons.\n\nBritish Mandate period\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, the population of 'Ain Karim was 1,735; consisting of 1,282 Muslims and 453 Christians, increasing in the 1931 census to 2,637, in 555 houses.\nDuring the 1929 riots in Palestine, Arab residents of 'Ain Karim launched raids against the nearby Jewish neighborhood of Bayit VeGan.\nIn the 1945 statistics, Ein Karim had a population of 3,180; 2,510 Muslims and 670 Christians, The total land area was 15,029 dunams, of this, a total of 7,960 dunums of land were irrigated or used for plantations, 1,199 were used for cereals; while a total of 1,704 dunams were classified as built-up (urban) areas.\nThe 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine placed 'Ayn Karim in the Jerusalem enclave intended for international control.\n\n1948 Arab–Israeli War\nWhen the 1947–1949 Palestine war started, 'Ain Karim became a major base of operations against nearby Jewish neighborhoods. In February 1948, the village's 300 guerilla fighters were reinforced by a well-armed Arab Liberation Army force of mainly Syrian fighters, and on March 10 a substantial Iraqi detachment arrived in the village. This was followed within days by some 160 Egyptian fighters. On March 19, the villagers joined their foreign guests in attacking a Jewish convoy on the Tel Aviv–Jerusalem road. Immediately after the April 1948 massacre at the nearby village of Deir Yassin (1.2 miles (2 km) to the north), most of the women and children in the village were evacuated.\nThe village was finally captured by Israeli forces during the ten-day campaign of July 1948. The remaining residents fled on July 10–11. The Arab Liberation Army forces which had camped in the village left on July 14–16 after Jewish forces captured two dominating hilltops, Khirbet Beit Mazmil and Khirbet al-Hamama, and shelled the village. During its last days, 'Ayn Karim suffered from severe food shortages.\n\nState of Israel\nAfter the war ended, Israel incorporated the village into the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem. Ein Karem was one of the few depopulated localities which survived the war with most of the buildings intact. The abandoned homes were resettled with inmigrants, many of whom Mizrahi Jews who fled from the Arab countries who fought the Arab-Israeli War during the war and after it, i.e. Jews from Iraq and Egypt but also from Yemen. Over the years, the bucolic atmosphere attracted a population of artisans and craftsmen. Today it is a vibrant bohemian neighborhood of Jerusalem, attracting many artist, young people and tourists.\nIn 1961, Hadassah built its medical center on a nearby hilltop, including the Hadassah Medical Center and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing, and pharmacology.\n\nBiblical connections\nOld Testament\nOnly the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible, the base for the Christian Old Testament, names a place in the hills of Judah as \"Carem\" (Joshua 15:30).\n\nNew Testament\nAccording to the New Testament, Mary went \"into the hill country, to a city of Judah\" (Luke 1:39) when she visited her cousin Elizabeth, the wife of Zechariah.\nDuring the Byzantine period, Theodosius (530 CE) gives the distance between Jerusalem and the town of Elizabeth as five miles (8.0 km).\nThe Jerusalem Calendar (Kalendarium Hyerosolimitanum) or the Georgian Festival Calendar, dated by some before 638, the year of the Muslim conquest, mentions the village by name, \"Enqarim,\" as the place of a festival in memory of Elizabeth celebrated on the twenty-eighth of August.\nThe English writer Saewulf, on pilgrimage to Palestine in 1102–1103, wrote of a monastery in the area of Ein Karim dedicated to St. Sabas, where 300 monks had been \"slain by Saracens\", but without mentioning any tradition connected to St. John.\n\nLandmarks\nChurch of the Visitation\nThe Church of the Visitation, or Abbey Church of St John in the Woods, is located across the village to the southwest from St. John's. The ancient sanctuary there was built against a rock declivity. It is venerated as the pietra del nascondimento, the \"stone in which John was concealed,\" in reference to the Protevangelium of James. The site is also attributed to John the Baptist's parental summer house, where Mary visited them. The modern church was built in 1955, also on top of ancient church remnants. It was designed by Antonio Barluzzi, an Italian architect, who designed many other churches in the Holy Land during the 20th century.\n\nMonastery of St. John in the Mountains\nThe Monastery of St. John Ba-Harim (lit. 'in the Mountains'), is centered on a church containing the cave identified by tradition as the birthplace of Saint John the Baptist. The church is built over the remnants of a Crusader church and its porch stands over the remains of two Byzantine chapels, both containing mosaic floors. The current structure received its outlook as the result of the latest large architectural intervention, finished in 1939 under the guidance of the Italian architect, Antonio Barluzzi.\nIn 1941–1942 the Franciscans excavated the area west of the church and monastery. The southernmost of the rock-cut chambers they found can probably be dated to the first century CE. Some remnants below the southern part of the porch suggests the presence of a mikve (Jewish ritual bath) that is dated to the Second Temple Period.\nThe church is mentioned in the Book of the Demonstration, attributed to Eutychius of Alexandria (940): \"The church of Bayt Zakariya in the district of Aelia bears witness to the visit of Mary to her kinswoman Elizabeth.\"\nThe site of the Crusader church built above the traditional birth cave of St John, destroyed after the departure of the Crusaders, was purchased by Franciscan custos, Father Thomas of Novara in 1621. After a decades-long struggle with the Muslim inhabitants, the Franciscans finally managed to rebuild and fortify their church and monastery by the 1690s.\n\nConvent of the Sisters of Zion\nThe monastery of Les Sœurs de Notre-Dame de Sion (Sisters of Our Lady of Zion), built in 1860, was founded by two brothers from France, Marie-Théodore Ratisbonne and Marie-Alphonse Ratisbonne, who were born Jewish and converted to Christianity.\nThey established an orphanage here. Alphonse himself lived in the monastery and is buried in its garden.\n\nGorny or \"Moscobia\" Convent\nThe convent was established by the Jerusalem mission of the Russian Orthodox Church in 1871. The name \"Gorny Convent\" refers to the visit of the Virgin Mary to her cousin St. Elizabeth \"into the hill country, to a town in Judah\", gorny meaning mountainous in Russian. It was nicknamed \"Muskobiya\" (Arabic for Muscovite) by the local Arab villagers, which mutated in Hebrew to \"Moskovia\".\nApart from the structures serving the nunnery and a pilgrims hostel, it now contains three churches, enclosed within a compound wall. The Church of Our Lady of Kazan (Kazanskaya) is dedicated to the holy icon of Our Lady of Kazan and is the oldest among the three churches, being consecrated in 1873. The Cathedral of All Russian Saints, with its gilded domes, was started before the Russian Revolution and could only be completed in 2007. The cave church of St. John the Baptist was consecrated in 1987.\n\nMary's Spring\nAccording to a Christian tradition which started in the 14th century, the Virgin Mary drank water from this village spring, and here is also the place where Mary and Elizabeth met. Therefore, since the 14th century the spring is known as the Fountain of the Virgin. The spring waters are considered holy by some Catholic and Orthodox Christian pilgrims who visit the site and fill their bottles. What looks like a spring is actually the end of an ancient aqueduct.\nThe former Arab inhabitants built a mosque and school on the site, of which a maqam and minaret still remain. An inscribed panel to the courtyard of the mosque dates it to 1828–1829 CE (AH 1244). The spring was repaired and renovated by Baron Edmond de Rothschild.\n\nMonastery of St. John in the Wilderness\nThe Monastery of St. John in the Wilderness, containing a cave associated with the saint, is located close to Ein Karem and Even Sapir.\n\nSt. Vincent\nSt. Vincent-Ein Kerem is a home for physically or mentally handicapped children. Founded in 1954, St. Vincent-Ein Kerem is a non-profit enterprise under leadership of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul.\n\nOther churches and religious institutions\nCatholic\nThe Convent of the Franciscan Sisters\nThe Convent of the Rosary Sisters, built in 1910\nCasa Nova, a guesthouse for pilgrims reopened in 2014\n\nGreek Orthodox\nThe Greek Orthodox Church of St John, built in 1894 on the remnants of an ancient church\n\nNotable residents\nShlomo Aronson (1936–2018), landscape architect\nErel Margalit (born 1961), high-tech and social entrepreneur\nNaomi Henrik (1920–2018), sculptor\n\nSee also\n1948 Palestine War\nBeit HaKerem, a biblical fortress in Judah identified with either the later Herodium site, Ramat Rachel, or Ein Kerem\nCarem, a town mentioned only in the Septuagint\nEin Kerem Agricultural School\nDepopulated Palestinian locations in Israel\nList of villages depopulated during the Arab–Israeli conflict\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nFurther reading\nOlivier Rota, « L'exode arabe d'Eïn-Kerem en 1948.

          "summary": "Ein Karem (Hebrew: עין כרם, romanized: ʿEin Kārem; Arabic: عين كارم, romanized: ʿAyn Kārim) also Ein Kerem or Ain Karem, is a historic mountain village southwest of Jerusalem, presently a neighborhood in the outskirts of the modern city, within the Jerusalem District in Israel. It is the site of the Hadassah Medical Center.\nEin Karem was an important Jewish village during the late Second Temple period, during which it became important to Christianity. Christian tradition holds that John the Baptist was born in Ein Karem, following the biblical verse in Luke saying John's family lived in a \"town in the hill country of Judea\". Probably because of its location between Bethlehem and Jerusalem, this location was a very comfortable one for a pilgrimage, and this led to the establishment of many churches and monasteries in the area.\nDuring the years of Ottoman and later British Mandate, Ein Karem was a Palestinian Arab village. It was depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. After the war it became once again a Jewish settlement. Today, Ein Karem is a vibrant bohemian neighborhood of Jerusalem, with a population of 2,000 (2010).\nIt has retained a very high-level of authenticity, its natural environment remains intact, and its old houses are still inhabited and preserved. It attracts three million visitors a year, one-third of them pilgrims from around the world. Alongside its religious landmarks, Ein Karem is also known for its fine art, culinary, and musical scenes.",
