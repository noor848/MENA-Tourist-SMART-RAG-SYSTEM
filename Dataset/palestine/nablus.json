      "content": "Nablus ( NA(H)B-ləs; Arabic: نابلس, romanized: Nābulus, locally [ˈnæːblɪs] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Nablus Governorate. It is located approximately 49 kilometres (30 mi) north of Jerusalem, between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim with a population of 156,906. The city is a commercial and cultural centre of Palestine, home to An-Najah National University, one of the largest institutions of higher learning in Palestine, and the Palestine Stock Exchange. Nablus is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).\nNablus has been traditionally associated with the ancient city of Shechem. However, Shechem is now identified with the nearby site of Tell Balata in the Balata al-Balad suburb of the West Bank.\nThe modern name of the city can be traced back to the Roman period, when it was named Flavia Neapolis by Roman emperor Vespasian in 72 CE. During the Byzantine period, conflict between the city's Samaritan and newer Christian inhabitants peaked in the Samaritan revolts that were eventually suppressed by the Byzantines by 573, which greatly dwindled the Samaritan population of the city. Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, the city was given its present-day Arabic name of Nablus. After the First Crusade, the Crusaders drafted the laws of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Council of Nablus, and its Christian, Samaritan, and Muslim inhabitants prospered. The city then came under the control of the Ayyubids and the Mamluk Sultanate. Under the Ottoman Turks, who conquered the city in 1517, Nablus served as the administrative and commercial centre for the surrounding area corresponding to the modern-day northern West Bank. Much of Nablus' history is preserved in its Old City, which contains more than 100 monumental buildings.\nAfter the city was captured by British forces during World War I, Nablus was incorporated into Mandatory Palestine in 1922. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Nablus, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Since the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, the West Bank has been occupied by Israel; since 1995, it has been governed by the Palestinian Authority as part of Area A of the West Bank. Today, the population is predominantly Muslim, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities.\n\nHistory\nClassical antiquity\nFlavia Neapolis ('new city of the emperor Flavius') was named in 72 CE by the Roman emperor Vespasian and applied to an older Samaritan village, variously called Mabartha ('the passage') or Mamorpha. Located between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, the new city lay 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) west of the Biblical city of Shechem which was destroyed by the Romans that same year during the First Jewish–Roman War. Holy places at the site of the city's founding include Joseph's Tomb and Jacob's Well. Because of the city's strategic geographic position and the abundance of water from nearby springs, Neapolis prospered, accumulating extensive territory, including the former Judean toparchy of Acraba.\nInsofar as the hilly topography of the site would allow, the city was built on a Roman grid plan and settled with veterans who fought in the victorious legions and other foreign colonists. In the 2nd century CE, Emperor Hadrian built a grand theater in Neapolis that could seat up to 7,000 people. Coins found in Nablus dating to this period depict Roman military emblems and gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon such as Zeus, Artemis, Serapis, and Asklepios. Neapolis was entirely pagan at this time. Justin Martyr who was born in the city c. 100 CE, came into contact with Platonism, but not with Christians there. The city flourished until the civil war between Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger in 198–9 CE. Having sided with Niger, who was defeated, the city was temporarily stripped of its legal privileges by Severus, who designated these to Sebastia instead.\n\nIn 244 CE, Philip the Arab transformed Flavius Neapolis into a Roman colony named Julia Neapolis. It retained this status until the rule of Trebonianus Gallus in 251 CE. The Encyclopaedia Judaica speculates that Christianity was dominant in the 2nd or 3rd century, with some sources positing a later date of 480 CE. It is known for certain that a bishop from Nablus participated in the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. The presence of Samaritans in the city is attested to in literary and epigraphic evidence dating to the 4th century CE. As yet, there is no evidence attesting to a Jewish presence in ancient Neapolis.\nSi'on suggested that Neapolis was about 900 acres (360 ha) in size during the Byzantine period, making it three times larger than it was when it was first established as a Roman colony. Magen estimates that around 20,000 people lived there during this period.\n\nConflict among the Christian population of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis was within the Palaestina Prima province under the rule of the Byzantine Empire. The tension was a result of Monophysite Christian attempts to prevent the return of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Juvenal, to his episcopal see. However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.\nAs tensions among the Christians of Neapolis decreased, tensions between the Christian community and the Samaritans grew dramatically. In 484, the city became the site of a deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of Aaron's sons and grandsons Eleazar, Ithamar and Phinehas. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to Constantinople, requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor Zeno erected a church dedicated to Mary on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and expropriated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.\nThus, the Samaritans rebelled again under the rule of emperor Anastasius I, reoccupying Mount Gerizim, which was subsequently reconquered by the Byzantine governor of Edessa, Procopius. A third Samaritan revolt which took place under the leadership of Julianus ben Sabar in 529 was perhaps the most violent. Neapolis' bishop Ammonas was murdered and the city's priests were hacked into pieces and then burned together with the relics of saints. The forces of Emperor Justinian I were sent in to quell the revolt, which ended with the slaughter of the majority of the Samaritan population in the city.\n\nEarly Muslim period\nNeapolis, along with most of Palestine, was conquered by the Muslims under Khalid ibn al-Walid, a general of the Rashidun army of Umar ibn al-Khattab, in 636 after the Battle of Yarmouk. The city's name was retained in its Arabicized form, Nabulus. The town prevailed as an important trade center during the centuries of Islamic Arab rule under the Umayyad, Abbasid and Fatimid dynasties.\nUnder Muslim rule, Nablus contained a diverse population of Arabs and Persians, Muslims, Samaritans, Christians and Jews. In the 9th century CE, Al-Yaqubi reported that Nablus had a mixed population of Arabs, Ajam (Non-Arabs), and Samaritans. In the 10th century, the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi, described it as abundant of olive trees, with a large marketplace, a finely paved Great Mosque, houses built of stone, a stream running through the center of the city, and notable mills. He also noted that it was nicknamed \"Little Damascus.\" At the time, the linen produced in Nablus was well known throughout the Old World.\n\nCrusader period\nThe city was captured by Crusaders in 1099, under the command of Prince Tancred, and renamed Naples. Though the Crusaders extorted many supplies from the population for their troops who were en route to Jerusalem, they did not sack the city, presumably because of the large Christian population there. Nablus became part of the royal domain of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Muslim, Eastern Orthodox Christian, and Samaritan populations remained in the city and were joined by some Crusaders who settled therein to take advantage of the city's abundant resources. In 1120, the Crusaders convened the Council of Nablus out of which was issued the first written laws for the kingdom. They converted the Samaritan synagogue in Nablus into a church. The Samaritan community built a new synagogue in the 1130s. In 1137, Arab and Turkish troops stationed in Damascus raided Nablus, killing many Christians and burning down the city's churches. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking the city. Queen Melisende of Jerusalem resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161, after she was granted control over the city in order to resolve a dispute with her son Baldwin III. Crusaders began building Christian institutions in Nablus, including a church dedicated to the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus, and in 1170 they erected a hospice for pilgrims.\n\nAyyubid and Mamluk rule\nCrusader rule came to an end in 1187, when the Ayyubids led by Saladin captured the city. According to a liturgical manuscript in Syriac, Latin Christians fled Nablus, but the original Eastern Orthodox Christian inhabitants remained. Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179–1229), wrote that Ayyubid Nablus was a \"celebrated city in Filastin (Palestine)... having wide lands and a fine district.\" He also mentions the large Samaritan population in the city. After its recapture by the Muslims, the Great Mosque of Nablus, which had become a church under Crusader rule, was restored as a mosque by the Ayyubids, who also built a mausoleum in the old city.\n\nIn October 1242, Nablus was raided by the Knights Templar. This was the conclusion of the 1242 campaign season in which the Templars had joined forces with the Ayyubid emir of Kerak, An-Nasir Dawud, against the Mamluks. The Templars raided Nablus in revenge for a previous massacre of Christians by their erstwhile ally An-Nasir Dawud. The attack is reported as a particularly bloody affair lasting for three days, during which the Mosque was burned and many residents of the city, Christians alongside Muslims, were killed or sold in the slave markets of Acre.\nThe successful raid was widely publicized by the Templars in Europe; it is thought to be depicted in a late 13th-century fresco in the Templar church of San Bevignate, Perugia.\nThe Samaritan synagogue, built in 362 by the high priest Akbon, and later converted into a church by the Crusaders, was converted into al-Khadra Mosque in 1244. Two other Crusader churches became the An-Nasr Mosque and al-Masakim Mosque during that century.\nThe Mamluk dynasty gained control of Nablus in 1260 and during their reign, they built numerous mosques and schools. Under Mamluk rule, Nablus possessed running water, many Turkish baths and exported olive oil and soap to Egypt, Syria, the Hejaz, several Mediterranean islands, and the Arabian Desert. The city's olive oil was also used in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. Ibn Battuta, the Arab explorer, visited Nablus in 1355, and described it as a city \"full of trees and streams and full of olives.\" He noted that the city grew and exported carob jam to Cairo and Damascus.\n\nOttoman era\nNablus came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, along with the whole of Palestine. The Ottomans divided Palestine into six sanjaks ('districts'): Safad, Jenin, Jerusalem, Gaza, Ajlun and Nablus, all of which were part of Ottoman Syria. These five sanjaks were subdistricts of the Vilayet of Damascus. Sanjak Nablus was further subdivided into five nahiya ('subdistricts'), in addition to the city itself. The Ottomans did not attempt to restructure the political configuration of the region on the local level such that the borders of the nahiya were drawn to coincide with the historic strongholds of certain families. Nablus was only one among a number of local centers of power within Jabal Nablus, and its relations with the surrounding villages, such as Beita and Aqraba, were partially mediated by the rural-based chiefs of the nahiya. During the 16th century, the population was predominantly Muslim, with Jewish, Samaritan and Christian minorities.\nAfter decades of upheavals and rebellions mounted by Arab tribes in the Middle East, the Ottomans attempted to reassert centralized control over the Arab vilayets. In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force led mostly by Arab sipahi officers from central Syria to reassert Ottoman authority in Nablus and its hinterland, as part of a broader attempt to established centralized rule throughout the empire at that time. In return for their services, the officers were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid creating contiguous territory controlled by individual clans. Contrary to its centralization purpose, the 1657 campaign allowed the Arab sipahi officers to establish their own increasingly autonomous foothold in Nablus. The officers raised their families there and intermarried with the local notables of the area, namely the ulama and merchant families. Without abandoning their nominal military service, they acquired diverse properties to consolidate their presence and income such as soap and pottery factories, bathhouses, agricultural lands, grain mills and, olive and sesame oil presses.\nThe most influential military family were the Nimrs, who were originally local governors of Homs and Hama's rural subdistricts. Other officer families included the Akhrami, Asqalan, Bayram, Jawhari, Khammash, Mir'i, Shafi, Sultan and Tamimi families, some of which remained in active service, while some left service for other pursuits. In the years following the 1657 campaign, two other families migrated to Nablus: the Jarrars from Balqa and the Tuqans from northern Syria or Transjordan. The Jarrars came to dominate the hinterland of Nablus, while the Tuqans and Nimrs competed for influence in the town. The former held the post of mutasallim ('tax collector, strongman') of Nablus longer, though non-consecutively than any other family. The three families maintained their power until the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, Zahir al-Umar, the autonomous Arab ruler of the Galilee became a dominant figure in Palestine. To build up his army, he strove to gain a monopoly over the cotton and olive oil trade of the southern Levant, including Jabal Nablus, which was a major producer of both crops. In 1771, during the Egyptian Mamluk invasion of Syria, Zahir aligned himself with the Mamluks and besieged Nablus, but did not succeed in taking the city. In 1773, he tried again without success. Nevertheless, from a political perspective, the sieges led to a decline in the importance of the city in favor of Acre. Zahir's successor, Jezzar Pasha, maintained Acre's dominance over Nablus. After his reign ended in 1804, Nablus regained its autonomy, and the Tuqans, who represented a principal opposing force, rose to power.\n\nEgyptian rule and Ottoman revival\nIn 1831–32 Khedivate Egypt, then led by Muhammad Ali, conquered Palestine from the Ottomans. A policy of conscription and new taxation was instituted which led to a revolt organized by the a'ayan (notables) of Nablus, Hebron and the Jerusalem–Jaffa area. In May 1834, Qasim al-Ahmad—the chief of the Jamma'in nahiya—rallied the rural sheikhs and fellahin (peasants) of Jabal Nablus and launched a revolt against Governor Ibrahim Pasha, in protest at conscription orders, among other new policies. The leaders of Nablus and its hinterland sent thousands of rebels to attack Jerusalem, the center of government authority in Palestine, aided by the Abu Ghosh clan, and they conquered the city on 31 May. However, they were later defeated by Ibrahim Pasha's forces the next month. Ibrahim then forced the heads of the Jabal Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages. By the end of August, the countrywide revolt had been suppressed and Qasim was executed.\nEgyptian rule in Palestine resulted in the destruction of Acre and thus, the political importance of Nablus was further elevated. The Ottomans wrested back control of Palestine from Egypt in 1840–41. However, the Arraba-based Abd al-Hadi clan which rose to prominence under Egyptian rule for supporting Ibrahim Pasha, continued its political dominance in Jabal Nablus.\nThroughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Nablus was the principal trade and manufacturing center in Ottoman Syria. Its economic activity and regional leadership position surpassed that of Jerusalem and the coastal cities of Jaffa and Acre. Olive oil was the primary product of Nablus and aided other related industries such as soap-making and basket weaving. It was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant, topping the production of northern cities such as Damascus. Jabal Nablus enjoyed a greater degree of autonomy than other sanjaks under Ottoman control, probably because the city was the capital of a hilly region, in which there were no \"foreigners\" who held any military or bureaucratic posts. Thus, Nablus remained outside the direct \"supervision\" of the Ottoman government, according to historian Beshara Doumani.\n\nWorld War I and British Mandate\nBetween 19 September and 25 September 1918, in the last months of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War the Battle of Nablus took place, together with the Battle of Sharon during the set piece Battle of Megiddo. Fighting took place in the Judean Hills where the British Empire's XX Corps and Royal Flying Corps attacked the Ottoman Empire's Yildirim Army Group's Seventh Army which held a defensive position in front of Nablus, and which the Eighth Army had attempted to retreat to, in vain.\nThe 1927 Jericho earthquake destroyed many of the Nablus' historic buildings, including the An-Nasr Mosque. Though they were subsequently rebuilt by Haj Amin al-Husayni's Supreme Muslim Council in the mid-1930s, their previous \"picturesque\" character was lost. During the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the British authorities demolished buildings in the Old City quarter of Qaryun suspected of harboring insurgents or hiding weapons. Jewish immigration did not significantly impact the demographic composition of Nablus, and it was slated for inclusion in the Arab state envisioned by the United Nations General Assembly's 1947 partition plan for Palestine.\n\nJordanian occupation\nDuring the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Nablus came under Jordanian occupation. Thousands of Palestinian refugees displaced from areas captured by Israeli forces arrived in Nablus, settling in refugee camps in and around the city. Its population doubled, and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps are still located within the city limits today: Ein Beit al-Ma', Balata and Askar. During the Jordanian occupation, the adjacent villages of Rafidia, Balata al-Balad, al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality. Nablus was occupied and annexed by Jordan in 1950.\n\nIsraeli period\nThe Six-Day War ended with the Israeli occupation of Nablus. Many Israeli settlements were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada were met by a back-to-the-land movement to secure self-sufficiency, and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production.\nBassam Shakaa was elected mayor in 1976, and four years later he survived an assassination attempt by the Jewish Underground on 2 June 1980, considered a terrorist group by Israel, which resulted in Shakaa losing both his legs. The Israeli administration removed him from office in the spring of 1982, and installed an army officer who ran the city for the following three and a half years.\nIn response to the murder of two Israeli teachers on 21 July near Jenin and the killing of another Israeli on 30 July, the Israeli army imposed a 5-day curfew on the city on 29 July 1985 that was lifted 2 hours a day. Najah University was closed for two months for hanging PLO propaganda posters.\nThe Israeli administration ended in January 1986 with the appointment of Zafer al-Masri as mayor. A popular leader of the Nablus Chamber of Commerce, al-Masri began a program of improvements in the town. Despite maintaining that he would have nothing to do with Israeli autonomy plans, he was assassinated on 2 March 1986, widely believed to be the work of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\nSalah el Bah'sh was shot with a rubber bullet by an Israeli soldier on 18 June 1989 whilst walking through the Nablus Casbah. Witnesses told B'Tselem that he was shot in the chest at close range after not responding to a soldier shouting \"Ta'amod\" (Halt!). Bah'sh died and the army indicated that an investigation was being carried out.\n\nPalestinian control\nJurisdiction over the city was handed over to the Palestinian National Authority on 12 December 1995, as a result of the Oslo Accords Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Nablus is neighbored by Israeli settlements, and was site of regular clashes with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during the First Intifada when the local prison was known for torture.\nThe city was a hub of Palestinian nationalist activity in the West Bank in the 1990s, and when the Second Intifada began, arsonists of Jewish shrines in Nablus were applauded. After the controversy over the Muhammad cartoons in Jyllands-Posten, published in Denmark in late September 2006, militias kidnapped two foreigners and threatened to kidnap more as a protest. Noa Meir, an Israeli military spokeswoman, said in 2008 that the city remains \"capital of terror\" of the West Bank.\nFrom the start of the Second Intifada, which began in September 2000, Nablus became a flash-point of clashes between the IDF and Palestinians. The city has a tradition of political activism, as evinced by its nickname, jabal al-nar (mountain of fire) and, located between two mountains, was closed off at both ends of the valley by Israeli checkpoints. For several years, movements in and out of the city were highly restricted. Nablus produced more Palestinian suicide attacks than any other city during the Second Intifada. The city and the refugee camps of Balata and Askar constituted the center of \"knowhow\" for the production and operation of the rockets in the West Bank.\nAccording to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 522 residents of Nablus and surrounding refugee camps, including civilians, were killed and 3,104 injured during IDF military operations from 2000 to 2005. In April 2002, following the Passover massacre—an attack by Palestinian militants that killed 30 Israeli civilians attending a seder dinner at the Park Hotel in Netanya—Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield, a major military operation targeting in particular Nablus and Jenin. At least 80 Palestinians were killed in Nablus during the operation and several houses were destroyed or severely damaged.\nThe operation also resulted in severe damage to the historic core of the city, with 64 heritage buildings being heavily damaged or destroyed. IDF forces reentered Nablus during Operation Determined Path in June 2002, remaining inside the city until the end of September. Over those three months, there had been more than 70 days of full 24-hour curfews. According to Gush Shalom, IDF bulldozers damaged the al-Khadra Mosque, the Great Mosque, the al-Satoon Mosque and the Greek Orthodox Church in 2002. Some 60 houses were destroyed, and parts of the stone-paving in the old city were damaged. The al-Shifa hammam was hit by three rockets from Apache helicopters. The eastern entrance of the Khan al-Wikala (old market) and three soap factories were destroyed in F-16 bombings. The cost of the damage was estimated at $80 million US.\nThe Old City of Nablus became a site of fierce clashes in August 2016 between a militant group and Palestinian police. Two Palestinian Police officers were killed by terrorists in the city on 18 August. Shortly after, the police raid on the suspected areas in the Old City deteriorated into a gun battle, in which three armed militants were killed, including one killed by beating following his arrest. The person beaten to death was the suspected “mastermind” behind the August 18 shooting - Ahmed Izz Halaweh, a senior member of the armed wing of the Fatah movement the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. His death was branded by the UN and Palestinian factions as a part of “extrajudicial executions.” A widespread manhunt for multiple gunmen was initiated by the police as a result, concluding with the arrest of one suspect Salah al-Kurdi on 25 August.\n\nGeography\nNablus lies in a strategic position at a junction between two ancient commercial roads; one linking the Sharon coastal plain to the Jordan valley, the other linking Nablus to the Galilee in the north, and the biblical Judea to the south through the mountains. The city stands at an elevation of around 550 meters (1,800 ft) above sea level, in a narrow valley running roughly east–west between two mountains: Mount Ebal, the northern mountain, is the taller peak at 940 meters (3,080 ft), while Mount Gerizim, the southern mountain, is 881 meters (2,890 ft) high.\nNablus is located 42 kilometers (26 mi) east of Tel Aviv, Israel, 110 kilometers (68 mi) west of Amman, Jordan and 63 kilometers (39 mi) north of Jerusalem. Nearby cities and towns include Huwara and Aqraba to the south, Beit Furik to the southeast, Tammun to the northeast, Asira ash-Shamaliya to the north and Kafr Qaddum and Tell to the west.\n\nOld City\nIn the center of Nablus lies the old city, composed of six major quarters: Yasmina, Gharb, Qaryun, Aqaba, Qaysariyya, and Habala. Habala is the largest quarter and its population growth led to the development of two smaller neighborhoods: al-Arda and Tal al-Kreim. The old city is densely populated and prominent families include the Nimrs, Tuqans, and Abd al-Hadis. The large fortress-like compound of the Abd al-Hadi Palace built in the 19th century is located in Qaryun. The Nimr Hall and the Tuqan Palace are located in the center of the old city. There are several mosques in the Old City: the Great Mosque of Nablus, An-Nasr Mosque, al-Tina Mosque, al-Khadra Mosque, Hanbali Mosque, al-Anbia Mosque, Ajaj Mosque and others.\nThere are six hamaams (Turkish baths) in the Old City, the most prominent of them being al-Shifa and al-Hana. Al-Shifa was built by the Tuqans in 1624. Al-Hana in Yasmina was the last hamaam built in the city in the 19th century. It was closed in 1928 but restored and reopened in 1994. Several leather tanneries, souks, pottery and textile workshops line the Old City streets. Also located in the Old City is the 15th-century Khan al-Tujjar caravanserai and the Manara Clock Tower, built in 1906.\n\nClimate\nThe relatively temperate Mediterranean climate brings hot, dry summers and cool, rainy winters to Nablus. Spring arrives around March–April and the hottest months in Nablus are July and August with the average high being 29.6 °C (85.3 °F). The coldest month is January with temperatures usually at 6.2 °C (43.2 °F). Rain generally falls between October and March, with annual precipitation rates being approximately 656 mm (25.8 in).\n\nDemographics\nIn 1596, the population consisted of 806 Muslim households, 20 Samaritan households, 18 Christian households, and 15 Jewish households. Local Ottoman authorities recorded a population of around 20,000 residents in Nablus in 1849. In 1867 American visitors found the town to have a population of 4,000 'the chief part of whom are Mohammedans', with some Jews and Christians and 'about 150 Samaritans'. In the 1922 British census of Palestine, there were a total of 15,947 inhabitants (15,238 Muslims, 544 Christians, 147 Samaritans, 16 Jews, and two Druze). Population continued to grow, rising to 17,189 (16,483 Muslims, 533 Christians, 160 Samaritans, seven Druze, and six Jews) at the 1931 census of Palestine with 309 in nearby suburbs (225 Muslims and 84 Christians).\nThe 1938 village statistics show a further increase to 19,200. The 1945 village statistics list the population as 23,250 (22,360 Muslims, 680 Christians, and 120 \"other\").\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Nablus had a population of 126,132 in 2007. In the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 100,034, including 23,397 refugees, accounting for about 24% of the city's residents. Nablus' Old City had a population of 12,000 in 2006. The population of Nablus city comprises 40% of its governorate's inhabitants.\nApproximately half of population is under 20 years old. In 1997, the age distribution of the city's inhabitants was 28.4% under the age of 10, 20.8% from 10 to 19, 17.7% from 20 to 29, 18% from 30 to 44, 11.1% from 45 to 64 and 3.7% above the age of 65. The gender distribution was 50,945 males (50.92%) and 49,089 females (49.07%).\n\nReligion\nIn 891 CE, during the early centuries of Islamic rule, Nablus had a religiously diverse population of Samaritans, Muslims and Christians. Arab geographer Al-Dimashqi, recorded that under the rule of the Mamluk Dynasty (Muslim Dynasty based in Egypt), local Muslims, Samaritans, Orthodox Christians, Catholics and Jews populated the city. At the 1931 census, the population was counted as 16,483 Muslims, 533 Christians, 6 Jews, 7 Druses and 160 Samaritans.  However, this census was taken after the 1929 Palestine riots which drove the Jews out of many majority-Arab cities.\nThe majority of the inhabitants today are Muslim, but there are small Christian and Samaritan communities as well. Much of the local Palestinian Muslim population of Nablus is believed to be descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Certain Nabulsi family names are associated with Samaritan ancestry – Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others. According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted because of persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to accept it.\nIn 1967, there were about 3,500 Christians of various denominations in Nablus, but that figure dwindled to about 650 in 2008. Of the Christian populace, there are seventy Orthodox Christian families, about thirty Catholic (Roman Catholic and Eastern Melkite Catholic) families and thirty Anglican families. Most Christians used to live in the suburb of Rafidia in the western part of the city.\nThere are seventeen Islamic monuments and eleven mosques in the Old City. Nine of the mosques were established before the 15th century. In addition to Muslim houses of worship, Nablus contains an Orthodox church dedicated to Saint Justin Martyr, built in 1898, and the ancient Samaritan synagogue, which is still in use.\n\nEconomy\nBeginning in the early 16th century, trade networks connecting Nablus to Damascus and Cairo were supplemented by the establishment of trading posts in the Hejaz and Gulf regions to the south and east, as well as in the Anatolian Peninsula and the Mediterranean islands of Crete and Cyprus. Nablus also developed trade relations with Aleppo, Mosul, and Baghdad. The Ottoman government oversaw the safety and funding of the annual hajj (qafilat al-hajj) from Damascus to the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Pilgrimage caravans became a key factor in the fiscal and political relationship between Nablus and the central government. For a brief period in the early 17th century, the governor of Nablus, Farrukh Pasha, was appointed leader of \nthe caravan (amir al-hajj), and he constructed a large commercial compound in Nablus for that purpose.\n\nIn 1882, there were 32 soap factories and 400 looms exporting their products throughout the Middle East. Nablus exported three-fourths of its soap — the city's most important commodity—to Cairo by caravan through Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula, and by sea through the ports of Jaffa and Gaza. From Egypt, and particularly from Cairo and Damietta, Nablus merchants imported mainly rice, sugar, and spices, as well as linen, cotton, and wool textiles. Cotton, soap, olive oil, and textiles were exported to Damascus, whence silks, high-quality textiles, copper, and a number luxury items, such as jewellery were imported. Outside  the city limits, extensive fields of olive groves, fig and pomegranate orchards and grape vineyards covered the  slopes. Crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, melons and mulukhiyya were grown in the fields and grain mills were  scattered across central Samaria. Nablus was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant, producing over 225,000 kg (496,040 lb) of the product by 1837.\nToday, Nablus has a bustling modern commercial center with restaurants, and shopping malls. Traditional industries\n such as the production of soap, olive oil, and Palestinian handicrafts continue to operate in Nablus.\n Other industries include furniture production, tile production, stone quarrying, textile manufacturing and leather tanning. The city is widely known for sweets like kunafah, olive oil, soap and ice-cream.\nThe Vegetable Oil Industry Co. is a Nablus factory that produces olive oil, and vegetable butter which is exported to Jordan. In 2000, the al-Huda Textiles factory in Nablus\nproduced 500 pieces of clothing daily; however, production dropped to 150–200 pieces in 2002. Al-Huda  imports textiles from China and exports finished products to Israel.  In 2003, there were eight restaurants  and four hotels — the largest being al-Qasr and al-Yasmeen. The  soap industry has suffered  from the West Bank closures and IDF incursions. In 2008, only two soap factories were still open. \n\nThe Al-Arz ice-cream company is the largest of six ice-cream manufacturers in the Palestinian territories. The Nablus business developed from an ice-factory set up by Mohammad Anabtawi in the town centre in 1950. It produces 50 tons a day, and exports to Jordan and Iraq. Most of the ingredients are imported from Israel.\nBefore 2000, 13.4% of Nablus' residents worked in Israel, with the figure dropping to 4.7% in 2004. The city's manufacturing sector made up 15.7% of the economy in 2004, a drop from 21% in 2000. Since 2000, most of the workforce has been employed in agriculture and local trade. In the wake of the Intifada, unemployment rates rose from 14.2% in 1997 to 60% in 2004. According to an OCHA report in 2008, one of the reasons for the high unemployment was a ring of checkpoints around the city, leading to the relocation of many businesses.\nSince the removal of the Hawara roadblock, the casbah has become a vibrant marketplace. Nablus is home to the Palestine Securities Exchange (PSE) and the al-Quds Financial Index, housed in the al-Qasr building in the Rafidia suburb of the city. The PSE's first trading session took place on 19 February 1997. In 2007, the capitalization of the PSE topped 3.5 million Jordanian dinars.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, 44,926 were enrolled in schools (41.2% in primary school, 36.2% in secondary school, and 22.6% in high school). About 19.8% of high school students received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas. In 2006, there were 234 schools and 93,925 students in the Nablus Governorate; 196 schools are run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 14 by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 24 are private schools.\nNablus is also home to an-Najah National University, the largest Palestinian university in the West Bank. Founded in 1918 by the an-Najah Nabulsi School, it became a college in 1941 and a university in 1977. An-Najah was closed down by Israeli authorities during the First Intifada, but reopened in 1991. Today, the university has three campuses in Nablus with over 16,500 students and 300 professors. The university's faculties include seven in the humanities and nine in the sciences.\nNablus has been ranked as the 5th best city in the Middle East to learn Arabic. For non-Arabic aspirants, An-Najah University has faculties, providing courses related to Arabic language.\n\nHealthcare\nThere are six hospitals in Nablus, the four major ones being al-Ittihad, St. Lukes, al-Watani (the National), and the Rafidia Surgical Hospital, which is located in the western neighborhood of Rafidiya, and is the largest hospital in the city. Al-Watani Hospital specializes in oncology services. The Anglican St. Lukes hospital was founded in 1900 by the medical missionary Gaskoin Wright; the National Hospital was founded in 1910. In addition to hospitals, Nablus contains the al-Rahma and at-Tadamon clinics, the al-Razi medical center, the Amal Center for Rehabilitation and 68 pharmacies. The Nablus Speciality Hospital was built in 2001, which is specializes in open heart surgery, angiograms and angioplasty.\n\nCulture and arts\nNablus and its culture enjoy a certain renown throughout the Palestinian Territories and the Arab world with significant and unique contributions to Palestinian culture, cuisine and costume. Nabulsi, meaning \"from Nablus\", is used to describe items such as handicrafts (e.g. Nabulsi soap) and food products (e.g. Nabulsi cheese) that are made in Nablus or in the traditional Nablus style.\n\nTraditional costume\nNablus costume was of a distinctive style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Because of its position as important trade center with a flourishing souk (\"market\"), in the late 19th century, there was a large choice of fabrics available in the city, from Damascus and Aleppo silk to Manchester cottons and calicos. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the Galilee, both long and short Turkish style jackets were worn over the thob (\"robe\"). For daily wear, thobs were often made of white cotton or linen, with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated interwoven striped bands of red, green and yellow on the front and back, with appliqué and braidwork popularly decorating the qabbeh (\"square chest piece\").\n\nCuisine\nNablus is one of the Palestinian cities that sustained elite classes, fostering the development of a culture of \"high cuisine\", such as that of Damascus or Baghdad. The city is home to a number of food products well known throughout the Levant, the Arab world and the former provinces of the Ottoman Empire.\nKanafeh (or Kunafa) is the best known Nabulsi sweet. It is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Now made throughout the Middle East, kanafeh Nabulsi uses a white-brine cheese called jibneh Nabulsi. Boiled sugar is used as a syrup for kanafeh.\nOther sweets made in Nablus include baklawa, \"Tamriya\", mabrumeh and ghuraybeh, a plain pastry made of butter, flour and sugar in an \"S\"-shape, or shaped as fingers or bracelets.\n\nCultural centers\nThere are three cultural centers in Nablus. The Child Cultural Center (CCC), founded in 1998 and built in a renovated historic building, operates an art and drawing workshop, a stage for play performances, a music room, a children's library and a multimedia lab. The Children Happiness Center (CHC) was also established in 1998. Its main activities include promoting Palestinian culture through social events, dabke classes and field trips. In addition to national culture, the CHC has a football and chess team. The Nablus municipal government established its own cultural center in 2003, called the Nablus Municipality Cultural Center (NMCC) aimed at establishing and developing educational facilities.\n\nSoap production\nNabulsi soap or sabon nabulsi is a type of castile soap produced only in Nablus and made of three primary ingredients: virgin olive oil, water, and a sodium compound. Since the 10th century, Nabulsi soap has enjoyed a reputation for being a fine product, and has been exported across the Arab world and to Europe. Though the number of soap factories decreased from a peak of thirty in the 19th century to only two today, efforts to preserve this important part of Palestinian and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue.\nMade in a cube-like shape about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) tall and 2.25 by 2.25 inches (5.7 by 5.7 cm) wide, the color of Nabulsi soap is like that of \"the page of an old book.\" The cubes are stamped on the top with the seal of the factory that produces it. The soap's sodium compound came from the barilla plant. Prior to the 1860s, in the summertime, the barilla would be placed in towering stacks, burned, and then the ashes and coals would be gathered into sacks, and transported to Nablus from the area of modern-day Jordan in large caravans. In the city, the ashes and coals were pounded into a fine natural alkaline soda powder called qilw. Today, qilw is still used in combination with lime.\n\nLocal government\nThe city of Nablus is the muhfaza (seat) of the Nablus Governorate, and is governed by a municipal council made up of fifteen elected members, including the mayor.\nThe two primary political parties in the municipal council are Hamas and Fatah. In the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections, the Reform and Change list representing the Hamas faction won 73.4% of the vote, gaining the majority of the municipal seats (13). Palestine Tomorrow, representing Fatah, gained the remaining two seats with 13.0% of the vote. Other political parties, such as the Palestinian People's Party and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine failed to gain any seats in the council, though they each received over 1,000 votes.\nYaish's four-year term legally expired in December 2009. While elections in the West Bank were scheduled for 17 July 2010, they were canceled because of Fatah's lack of agreement on list of candidates. Nablus was one of the most important municipalities where Fatah failed to resolve internal conflicts that resulted in two competing Fatah lists: one headed by former mayor Ghassan Shakaa and one headed by Amin Makboul.\nIn the October 2012 municipal elections, Hamas boycotted the polls, protesting the holding of elections while reconciliation efforts with Fatah were at a standstill. Former mayor Ghassan Shakaa, a former local Fatah leader, won the vote as an independent against Fatah member Amin Makboul and another independent candidate.\n\nMayors\nModern mayorship in Nablus began in 1869 with the appointment of Sheikh Mohammad Tuffaha by the Ottoman governor of Syria/Palestine. On 2 July 1980, Bassam Shakaa, then mayor of Nablus, lost both of his legs as a result of a car bombing carried out by Israeli militants affiliated with the Gush Emunim Underground movement.\nThe current mayor, Adly Yaish, a Hamas member, was arrested by the Israel Defense Forces in May 2007, during Operation Summer Rains, launched in retaliation for the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas. Municipal council members Abdel Jabbar Adel Musa \"Dweikat\", Majida Fadda, Khulood El-Masri, and Mahdi Hanbali were also arrested. He spent 15 months in prison without being charged.\n\nMunicipal services\nIn 1997, 99.7% of Nablus' 18,003 households were connected to electricity through a public network. Prior to its establishment in 1957, electricity came from private generators. Today, the majority of the inhabitants of 18 nearby towns, in addition to the city's inhabitants, are connected to the Nablus network.\nThe majority of households are connected to a public sewage system (93%), with the remaining 7% connected through cesspits. The sewage system, established n the early 1950s, also connects the refugee camps of Balata, Askar and Ein Beit al-Ma'. Pipe water is provided for 100% of the city's households, primarily through a public network (99.3%), but some residents receive water through a private system (0.7%). The water network was established in 1932 by the British authorities and is fed by water from four nearby wells: Deir Sharaf, Far'a, al-Badan and Audala.\n\nFire department\nNablus is one of the few cities in the West Bank to have a fire department, which was founded in 1958. At that time, the \"fire brigade\" (as it was called) was composed of five members and one extinguishing vehicle. In 2007, the department had seventy members and over twenty vehicles. Until 1986, it was responsible for all of the northern West Bank, but today it only covers the Nablus and Tubas Governorates. From 1997 to 2006, Nablus' fire department extinguished 15,346 fires.\n\nTransportation\nIn the early 20th century, Nablus was the southernmost station of a spur from the Jezreel Valley railway's Afula station, itself a spur from the Hejaz railway. The extension of the railway to Nablus was built in 1911–12. During the beginning of the British Mandate, one weekly train was operated from Haifa to Nablus via Afula and Jenin. The railway was destroyed during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and the route of the line was bisected by the Green Line.\nThe main Beersheba–Nazareth road running through the middle of the West Bank ends in Nablus, although the thoroughfare of local Arabs is severely restricted. The city was connected to Tulkarm, Qalqilya and Jenin by roads which are now blocked by the Israeli West Bank barrier. From 2000 until 2011, Israel maintained checkpoints such as Huwwara checkpoint which effectively cut off the city, severely curtailing social and economic travel. From January 2002, buses, taxis, trucks and private citizens required a permit from the Israeli military authorities to leave and enter Nablus. Since 2011, there has been a relaxation of travel restrictions and the dismantlement of some checkpoints.\nThe nearest airport is the Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod, Israel, but because of restrictions governing the entry of Palestinians to Israel, and their lack of access to foreign Embassies to get travel visas, many residents must travel to Amman, Jordan to use the Queen Alia International Airport, which requires passage through a number of checkpoints and the Jordanian border. Taxis are the main form of public transportation within Nablus and the city contains 28 taxi offices and garages.\n\nSports\nThe Nablus football stadium has a capacity of 8,000. The stadium is home to the city's football club al-Ittihad, which is in the main league of the Palestinian Territories. The club participated in the Middle East Mediterranean Scholar Athlete Games in 2000.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nNablus is twinned, or has sister city relationships with:\n\nSee also\nList of cities administered by the Palestinian National Authority\nList of people from Nablus\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nWelcome To The City of Nablus\nNablus City, Welcome to Palestine\nA site explaining the reasons for the devastated Palestinian economy\nNablus the Culture, reviving cultural life in Nablus Archived 15 April 2022 at the Wayback Machine\nNablus after Five Years of Conflict December 2005 report by OCHA (PDF).\nArchaeological Remains Found in Nablus\nPicture showing Nablus from east (Panorama)\nPicture showing east region of Nablus (Panorama) – The picture taken from Askar\nBahjat Sabri, \"Urban Aspects in the City of Nablus in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century\" An-Najah University Journal for Research - Humanities, Volume 6 (1992)",
      "summary": "Nablus ( NA(H)B-ləs; Arabic: نابلس, romanized: Nābulus, locally [ˈnæːblɪs] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Nablus Governorate. It is located approximately 49 kilometres (30 mi) north of Jerusalem, between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim with a population of 156,906. The city is a commercial and cultural centre of Palestine, home to An-Najah National University, one of the largest institutions of higher learning in Palestine, and the Palestine Stock Exchange. Nablus is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).\nNablus has been traditionally associated with the ancient city of Shechem. However, Shechem is now identified with the nearby site of Tell Balata in the Balata al-Balad suburb of the West Bank.\nThe modern name of the city can be traced back to the Roman period, when it was named Flavia Neapolis by Roman emperor Vespasian in 72 CE. During the Byzantine period, conflict between the city's Samaritan and newer Christian inhabitants peaked in the Samaritan revolts that were eventually suppressed by the Byzantines by 573, which greatly dwindled the Samaritan population of the city. Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century, the city was given its present-day Arabic name of Nablus. After the First Crusade, the Crusaders drafted the laws of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Council of Nablus, and its Christian, Samaritan, and Muslim inhabitants prospered. The city then came under the control of the Ayyubids and the Mamluk Sultanate. Under the Ottoman Turks, who conquered the city in 1517, Nablus served as the administrative and commercial centre for the surrounding area corresponding to the modern-day northern West Bank. Much of Nablus' history is preserved in its Old City, which contains more than 100 monumental buildings.\nAfter the city was captured by British forces during World War I, Nablus was incorporated into Mandatory Palestine in 1922. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War saw the entire West Bank, including Nablus, occupied and annexed by Transjordan. Since the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, the West Bank has been occupied by Israel; since 1995, it has been governed by the Palestinian Authority as part of Area A of the West Bank. Today, the population is predominantly Muslim, with small Christian and Samaritan minorities.",

      "content": "نَابُلُس احدى اكبر المدن الفلسطينيه سكانًا واهمها موقعًا. وهي مقر جامعه النجاح الوطنيه اكبر الجامعات الفلسطينيه. تعتبر نابلس مركزاً لشمال الضفه الغربيه اضافهً الى كونها عاصمه لمحافظه نابلس التي تضم 56 قريه ويُقدر عدد سكانها بقرابه (388,321) نسمه حسب احصاءات عام 2017. تُعرف ايضا باسماء جبل النار ودمشق الصغرى وعش العلماء وملكه فلسطين غير المتوجه. لعبت المدينه ادوارًا مهمه خلال النزاعات في بلاد الشام، ويعتقد انها كانت اكبر مدينه في فلسطين في اواسط القرن الثامن عشر والنصف الاول من القرن التاسع عشر.\nفي القرنين الخامس والسادس للميلاد ادّى نزاع بين سكان المدينه من السامريين والمسيحيين الى بروز عدد من الانتفاضات السامريه ضد الحكم البيزنطي، قبل ان تقوم الامبراطوريه باخماد ثوراتهم هذه بالعنف، مما ادى لاضمحلال عددهم في المدينه.\nفتح العرب المسلمون، في زمن خلافه ابي بكر الصديق، هذه المدينه وباقي فلسطين وبلاد الشام، وفي هذا العهد عُرّب اسمها ليصبح نابلس بدلاً من نيابوليس، وازداد عدد المسلمين من سكانها واخذت بعض من كنائسها ومعابدها السامريه تتحول الى مساجد شيئاً فشيئاً، ثم سقطت نابلس تحت الحكم الصليبي عام 1099 قبل ان تعود لحكم المسلمين الايوبيين والمماليك بعدهم.\nاصبحت نابلس عاصمه سنجق نابلس في العهد العثماني، وكانت في هذه الفتره سنجقا تابعا لاياله دمشق ثم لاياله صيدا (التي خلفت اياله عكا واجزاء من اياله دمشق) واخيرًا ولايه بيروت وفي اخر تقسيم اداري عثماني خضعت المدينه للحكم المصري الذي دام تسع سنوات في بلاد الشام، في العقد الرابع من القرن التاسع عشر، وقبل ان تعود الى الحكم العثماني. احتلها البريطانيون عندما انهزمت الدوله العثمانيه في الحرب العالميه الاولى وخضعت فلسطين للانتداب البريطاني. وسقطت نابلس تحت الاحتلال الاسرائيلي عام 1967 حينها سقطت الضفه الغربيه باكملها.\nتشتهر المدينه القديمه بصناعه الصابون، وبالكنافه النابلسيه، التي تعتبر من اشهر الحلويات الشرقيه في بلاد الشام، بالاضافه الى بعض المنتجات الزراعيه مثل الزعتر النابلسي والجبن النابلسي.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالموقع\nاذا كانت فلسطين قلب الوطن العربي لربطها شماله بجنوبه وشرقه بغربه، فان نابلس هي قلب فلسطين لربطها شمالها بجنوبها وشرقها بغربها. كانت المدينه مركزاً للواء نابلس في الضفه الغربيه بعد عام 1948م وتحولت في منتصف الستينات مركزاً لمحافظه نابلس، تتمتع بموقع جغرافي هام فهي تتوسط اقليم المرتفعات الجبليه الفلسطينيه وجبال نابلس، وتعد حلقه في سلسله المدن الجبليه من الشمال الى الجنوب وتقع على مفترق الطرق الرئيسيه التي تمتد من الناصره وجنين شمالاً حتى الخليل جنوباً ومن يافا غرباً حتى جسر داميه شرقًا. تبعد عن القدس 69 كم وعن عمان 114 كم وعن البحر المتوسط 42 كم، تربطها بمدنها وقراها شبكه جيده من الطرق تصلها بطولكرم وقلقيليه ويافا غرباً وبعمان شرقاً وبجنين والناصره شمالاً وبالقدس جنوباً. في عام 1915 ربطت نابلس مع خط سكه حديد الحجاز الممتد من دمشق الى المدينه المنوره.\nاقيمت نابلس في اجمل بقعه جغرافيه في وسط فلسطين. وصفها شيخ الربوه الدمشقي بانها «قصر في بستان». قال عنها عمر السكندري في كتابه «تاريخ سوريا» المطبوع في بيروت عام 1882:\n\nيرتفع وسط مدينه نابلس 550 مترا فوق سطح البحر بينما يبلغ ارتفاع اطرافها حتى 800 متر ف.س.ب. تقدر مساحه المدينه العمرانيه بحوالي 12700 دونم. يمتد عمران المدينه فوق جبل عيبال شمالاً وجبل جرزيم جنوباً وبينهما وادٍ يمتد نحو الغرب. ولخصوصيه الموقع الجغرافي لمدينه نابلس المتمثله بانحصارها بين جبلين تتواجد في المدينه العشرات من عيون المياه التي تزيد من جمال وبهاء المدينه ومنها عين العسل، عين الست، عين الكاس، عين حسين، عين القريون، عين ميره، عين الخضر، عين الصلاحي، عين السكر، عين الصبيان، عين الساطور، عين العجيبه، عين بدران، عين التوباني، عين بير الدولاب، عين التوته بالاضافه الى سبل المياه مثل سبيل الغزاوي وسبيل الخضر وسبيل السلقيه وسبيل الساطور.\n\nتضم مدينه نابلس جامعه النجاح الوطنيه، كبرى الجامعات الفلسطينيه واقدمها وارفعها مستوى. اسست بلديه المدينه عام 1869 وهي تشرف على تنظيم المدينه وعلى المرافق العامه.\nتذكر كتب التاريخ وصف بعض الرحاله العرب لنابلس بدمشق الصغرى للتشابه مع دمشق بمعالمها ومناخها ومياهها وينابيعها وجبالها وفاكهتها وخضارها وحتى في لهجتها وكثير من عاداتها وتقاليدها. وهي اكثر مدن فلسطين شبهاً وارتباطاً بدمشق وسوريه منذ فجر التاريخ، حيث كان تجارها يصدرون الصابون والمنتجات المحليه الاخرى الى دمشق ويعودون بالاقمشه والتوابل. اضافه الى ذلك، يعود اصل العديد من عائلات نابلس الى مناطق في سوريه حالياً، مثل عائله النمر التي قدمت من منطقه حمص وحماه وعائله طوقان التي قدمت من منطقه حماه.\n\nالمناخ\nيسود في نابلس مناخ متوسطي معتدل، ذو صيف حار وجاف، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يحل فصل الربيع في اواخر شهر مارس (اذار) واوائل ابريل (نيسان)، ويعتبر شهرا يوليو (تموز) واغسطس (اب) احرّ شهور السنه، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحراره فيهما الى 28.9 ° مئويه (84 ° فهرنهايت)، اما اكثر الاشهر بروده فهو يناير (كانون الثاني)، ويصل فيه معدل درجه الحراره الى 3.9 ° مئويه (39 ° فهرنهايت). يتساقط المطر بين شهريّ اكتوبر (تشرين الاول) وابريل (نيسان) عادهً، ويبلغ معدل المتساقطات السنوي 589 مليمتراً (23.2 انش).\n\nقرى وبلدات نابلس\nيحيط بنابلس عدد كبير من القرى ولكنها معزوله عنها بالحواجز العسكريه الاسرائيليه، ففي الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه تم خنق المدينه بعده حواجز عسكريه مثل حاجز حواره من المدخل الجنوبي، وحاجز بيت ايبا من المدخل الغربي، وحاجز (17) من المدخل الشمالي وحاجز الباذان من المدخل الشرقي، وبعد انتهاء الانتفاضه الثانيه ازيلت هذه الحواجز، ثم اُنشئت حواجز جديده بعد عمليه طوفان الاقصى عام 2023 مثل حاجزي حواره وعورتا على طريق رام الله نابلس جنوباً، وحاجز المربعه قرب قريه تل من الجهه الجنوبيه الغربيه، وحاجز صره على طريق قلقيليه نابلس غرباً، وحاجز الطور جنوباً، وحاجز دير شرف من الجهه الغربيه الشماليه على طريق طولكرم نابلس، وحاجز مستوطنه شافي شمرون من الجهه الغربيه الشماليه على طريق جنين نابلس، اضافه الى بعض الحواجز العسكريه المتنقله غير الدائمه مثل حاجزي الباذان وبيت فوريك شرقاً، وحاجز (17) شمالاً.\nمن قراها:

سكان المدينه في عام 1596 يتالفون من 806 اسر مسلمه و18 اسره مسيحيه و15 اسره يهوديه و20 اسره سامريه، والاخيره طائفه دينيه يسمى افرادها بالسمره او السامريين. عاش السامريون قبل حرب 1967 في نابلس كمواطنين اردنيين يتمتعون بكافه حريات المواطنه كحال مسلمي ومسيحيي المدينه.\n\nخلال اوائل القرن التاسع عشر، قدر قسطنطين بازيلي سكان ناحيه نابلس بسته وعشرين الف عائله منها ما يقارب 1000 عائلهٍ مسيحيه. وتفيد السجلات العثمانيه ان عدد سكان نابلس بلغ 2000 نسمه عام 1849، وفي عام 1867 قال زوّار امريكيون، ان البلده بلغ عدد سكانها 4,000 نسمه «اكثرهم محمديون»، وبعض اليهود والمسيحيين، وحوالي 150 سامريّا. قدر عمر السكندري عام 1882 عدد سكانها بثمانيه الاف معظمهم مسلمون. وفي عام 1922 اظهر الاحصاء الرسمي البريطاني لسكان فلسطين، ان عدد سكان المدينه بلغ 15,947 نسمه، ثم ارتفع الى 17,498 عند احصاء عام 1931، و21900 نسمه عام 1941 ووصل عام 1945 الى حوالي 23300 نسمه. وبعد الاحتلال الصهيوني عام 1967 بلغ قرابه 61,050 نسمه، وعاد ليرتفع الى 106,900 عام 1987.\nبلغ عدد سكان نابلس 134,116 نسمه، في منتصف عام 2006، وفقًا للجهاز المركزي للاحصاء الفلسطيني. وفي احصاء الجهاز لعام 1997، ظهر ان عدد سكان المدينه وصل الى 100,034 نسمه، بما فيهم 23,397 لاجئ يشكلون 24% من سكان المدينه. وصل عدد سكان مدينه نابلس القديمه الى 12,000 نسمه عام 2006. تشكل المدينه المسكن لحوالي 40% من سكان المحافظه. توجد في المدينه اربعه مخيمات للاجئين الفلسطينيين هي عين بيت الماء وبلاطه وعسكر القديم وعسكر الجديد، يسكنها ما يفوق مجموعه ال40,000 نسمه.\nيشكل الشباب قسمًا كبيرًا من سكان نابلس، فقرابه نصف السكان يبلغون اعمارًا اقل من 20 سنه. بلغت نسبه السكان الذين تقل اعمارهم عن 10 سنوات، عام 1997، 28.4%، و20.8% للذين تتراوح اعمارهم بين 10 و19 سنه، 17.7% للذين تتراوح اعمارهم بين 20 و29 عام، 18% بين 30 و44 سنه، 11.1% بين 45 و64 سنه، و3.7% للذين تصل اعمارهم لاكثر من 65 عام. اما التوزيع بين الجنسين فكانت نسبته 50.92% (50,945 فردا) للذكور، و49.07% (49,089 فردا للاناث).\n\nالديانه\nكانت نابلس في عام 891 الميلادي، اي خلال العهود الاولى للحكم العربي، تحوي تنوعا دينيا كبيرا، وكان اكثريه سكانها يدينون بالاسلام، المسيحيه، والسامريه. يقول الجغرافي شمس الدين الانصاري الدمشقي، ان المدينه كانت خلال العهد المملوكي، ماهوله بالمسلمين، السامريين، المسيحيين الارثوذكس، المسيحيين الكاثوليك، واليهود. اظهر احصاء عام 1931 ان المدينه حوت 16,483 مسلمًا، 533 مسيحيًّا، 6 يهود، و167 شخص يدينون باديان اخرى، على الارجح ان معظمهم سامريّون.\nان معظم سكان نابلس اليوم يدينون بالاسلام، ولا يزال هناك ايضًا بعض المسيحيين والسامريين. يُعتقد ان كثيرًا من الفلسطينيين المسلمين في المدينه يتحدرون من سامريين اعتنقوا الاسلام عند الفتح الاسلامي لبلاد الشام، والبعض من اسماء العائلات المسلمه اليوم يتم ربطها بالسامريين ويُقال ان اجدادهم كانوا من اتباع ذلك الدين - مثل ال مسلماني وال يعيش وغيرهم. يقول المؤرخ فياض الطيف، ان اعدادًا كبيره من السامريين اعتنقوا الاسلام بسبب الاضطهاد الذي كانوا يتعرضون له، وبسبب الطبيعه التوحيديه للدين الجديد، الامر الذي جعلهم يتقبلونه بصوره اسهل واسرع.\nكان يسكن في المدينه حوالي 3,500 مسيحي عام 1967، ولكن اعدادهم انخفضت الى 650 عام 2008. يتالف المسيحيين في نابلس حاليّا، من 70 اسره روم ارثوذكس، حوالي 30 اسره من الروم الملكيين الكاثوليك، و30 اسره انجليكانيه. كان معظم المسيحيين يسكنون في ضاحيه رفيديا بالقسم الغربي من المدينه.\n\nتاريخ نابلس\nالتاريخ القديم\nنابلس او شكيم بالكنعانيه، مدينه من اقدم مدن العالم يعود تاريخها الى 5600 سنه (حوالي سنه 3600 ق.م). اسست عند ملتقى اقدام جبلي جرزيم في القسم الشرقي لمدينه نابلس الحاليه على يد العرب الكنعانيين فوق تل كبير يدعى الان تل بلاطه، وقد اسماها الكنعانيون في ذلك الوقت \"شكيم\" والتي تعني المكان المرتفع، ومن ثم اصبحت من اشهر المدن الكنعانيه. اقدم من سكن \"شكيم\" من العرب هم الحويون و‌الفرزيون. صارعت نابلس الكثير من الغزاه والمحتلين عبر تاريخها الطويل، بحيث غزاها كل من الفراعنه المصريين والقبائل العبريه والاشوريين والابليين والفارسيين واليونانيين والسلوقيين، الى ان سقطت بيد الرومان سنه 63 قبل الميلاد.\nورد ذكر شكيم في نصوص ايبلا التي اكتشفها عالم الاثار الايطالي باولو ماتييه ضمن مدن كنعانيه اخرى في فلسطين، وهي اضافه الى شكيم بيت جبرين واريحا واورسالم (يبوس) ومجيدو وبيسان. ورد ذكرها ايضاً في رسائل تل العمارنه (1400 ق.م) باسم شاكمي، كما ذكرت في تقارير تحتمس الثالث ايضاً.\n\nتشير النصوص المصريه القديمه بان شكيم كانت مدينهً محصنهً استراتيجيه ذات اهميه دوليه منذ سنه 1800 ق.م، كما كانت مركزاً للديانات الكنعانيه والحياه السياسيه، ويُفهم من النصوص المصريه القديمه ان علاقه فلسطين اصبحت وطيده بمصر ابتداءً من بدايه هذا العصر. وتتحدث رسائل تل العمارنه (سنه 1400-1350 ق.م) عن مدينه شكيم، تحت حكم اميرها الكنعاني لابعايو كمدينه تلعب دوراً هاماً في النضال ضد السيطره المصريه على منطقه فلسطين. وحسب ما ورد في التوراه فانها اول مدينه كنعانيه نزل فيها النبي ابراهيم الخليل قادماً من مدينه اور في العراق، وكان ذلك حوالي عام 1805 ق.م  وبعده اتى النبي يعقوب من فدان ارام على نهر الفرات في العراق، ونزل شكيم، ثم سكن مدينه كنعانيه تعرف باسم بيت ايل وتعني مقر الاله، وكانت مركز عباده الاله الكنعاني ال او ايل. ويذكر ان يعقوب عاد فيما بعد الى شكيم.\nوفي العصر الحديدي (1200-323 قبل الميلاد) استمرت المدن الكنعانيه بنفس نظام المدن المحصنه ذات القلاع خلال فترات العصر البرونزي. وتشير التوراه الى وجود حروب بين اليهود والكنعانيين الفلسطينيين. وقد سيطر اليهود على مدينتين كنعانيتين:\n\nالاولى: مدينه يبوس (اورشاليم)، مدينه اليبوسيين الكنعانيين وقلب مملكتهم منذ عصور ما قبل التاريخ، احتلها اليهود سنه 1000 ق.م بقياده النبي داود (100-963 ق.م)، ثم سليمان سنه 963 ق.م –923 ق.م. واستمر اليهود فيها تحت اسم مملكه يهودا حتى سقطت سنه 586 ق.م على يد نبوخذ نصر.\nالثانيه: مدينه شكيم، التي بدا نفوذهم فيها عام 923 ق.م وانتهى عام 722 ق.م على يد سرجون الثاني، وبقى فيها اهلها الكنعانيون، وتشير بعض المراجع الى احضار كنعانيين من الدواخل، وهم العموريون.\n\nسكنت مدينه شكيم فئه من بني اسرائيل لا تعترف من التوراه بغير الاسفار الخمسه الاولى المنسوبه الى النبي موسى، وتعرف هذه الفئه بالسامريين نسبه الى السامره. وقد ناصبهم اليهود العداء منذ ظهورهم. ويعتقد السامريون بان النبي ابراهيم همّ بالتضحيه بابنه اسحاق على جبل جرزيم. لا يزال معظم السامريين موجودين في مدينه نابلس حتى هذا اليوم ولا يتجاوز عددهم 250 نسمه، وقد خصص لهم مقعد في المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني المنتخب لاول مره في التاريخ الفلسطيني المعاصر عام 1996.\nسقطت فلسطين سنه 332 ق.م في يد الاسكندر المقدوني واصبحت تابعه للامبراطوريه اليونانيه حتى سنه 64 ق.م، وبعد وفاه الاسكندر خضعت للبطالمه والسـلوقيين. وقد تركت الهيلينيه بصماتها واضحه على بعض مظاهر الحياه ايام الحكم اليوناني وذلك بسبب انشاء سبعين مدينه ضخمه على الطراز الاغريقي في البلاد التي احتلها الجيش اليوناني. وقد اُستخدِمت مراكزَ ثقافيه نُشِرت بها الثقافه اليونانيه في بلدان العالم القديم. ومن المدن الثقافيه التي انشئت في العهد اليوناني بيلاوريون (تل الاشعري)، هيبوس (قلعه الحصن)، وهما تقعان شرق طبريا، ومدينه (فيلوتير) في الطرف الجنوبي من بحيره طبريا، وسميت بهذا الاسم نسبه الى فيلوتير شقيقه بطليموس الثاني فيلادلفوس، ومدينه جيراز (جرش). حول الاغريق الكثير من اسماء المدن الكنعانيه الفلسطينيه الى اسماء اغريقيه منها عكا، حيث سميت بتولما في عهد بطليموس الثاني، وبيت شان (بيسان) سميت سكيثوبوليس، وبيت جبرين اطلق عليها اليوثيروبوليس، وايلات سميت بيرينكه، وشكيم سميت نيابوليس. اصبحت المدينه تشتمل على رقعه واسعه من الاراضي تحيط بها الاسوار، وبها بوابات ضخمه ذات جلال، وفي داخل الاسوار يقع القصر الملكي او قصر الحاكم، وكذلك الساحه العامه والمدرج الضخم والمسرح وبرك السباحه والمعابد الضخمه المتعدده.\nوفي العصر الروماني (64 ق.م – 323 م) اقيم سور حول مدينه شكيم (السامره) طوله حوالي 170 اكد. اما بوابه المدينه فقد بنيت في الجهه الغربيه من المدينه وتضم برجين دائريين عظيمين بقطر 46 قدماً (14 متراً)، وهي مقامه على قواعد مربعه الشكل تعود للعصر الهيليني. ومبنى الباسيليكا في السامره يعود تاريخه الى العصر الروماني.\n\nوفي الفتره الممتده بين عاميّ 67 و69 للميلاد، قرر الرومان، تحت قياده الامبراطور فسبازيان، هدمها للمره الاخيره وبناء مدينه جديده الى الغرب منها اسموها «نيابوليس» اي المدينه الجديده والتي حرفت عنها لفظه نابلس الحاليه، وقد اقاموها وفق التخطيط الروماني في بناء المدن من حيث وجود شارعين متقاطعين ينتج عنهما اربع حارات، حيث ما زالت بعض هذه الحارات الرومانيه قائمه بتسميتها الرومانيه الى اليوم مثل حاره القيساريه. وفي عهد هادريان (117-138) اقام الرومان معبداً لجوبيتر على جبل جرزيم مكان معبد السامريين.\nوفي العصر البيزنطي (323 - 638) انتصرت المسيحيه فاصبحت كل فلسطين وبضمنها نابلس تدين بالمسيحيه واصبحت نابلس مركزاً لاسقفيه. وفي القرن الخامس الميلادي بنى الرومان المسيحيون على قمه جبل جرزيم كنيسه تخليداً لمريم العذراء. وفي عهد الامبراطور جستنيان (527-565) شيدت بالقرب من كنيسه مريم قلعه مسوره لا تزال اثارها باقيه، كما اعاد الرومان بناء خمس كنائس تهدمت في حروب سابقه.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nفي عام 638م فتح العرب المسلمون نابلس بقياده عمرو بن العاص في خلافه عمر بن الخطاب، وقد تعهد المسلمون بحمايه من بقي من اهلها على دينه من المسيحيين على ان يدفعوا الجزيه عن رقابهم والخراج عن اراضيهم. اصبحت نابلس بعد الفتح الاسلامي مدينه من مدن جند فلسطين الذي كانت قصبته اللد ثم الرمله.\nاستولى عليها الصليبيون في سنه 1099م بقياده تانكرد صاحب انطاكيه، وبنى بالدوين الاول (1100-1118م) ملك بيت المقدس الفرنجي فيها قلعه على راس جبل جرزيم لحمايه قواته ومراقبه تحركات المسلمين. وعقد فيها خلال الاحتلال الصليبي مجمع كنسي كبير في سنه 1120م تحت رعايه بالدوين الثاني (1118-1130م). غير الصليبيون اسمها الى (باللاتينيه: Naples).\nعادت نابلس بقراها وجبالها الى المسلمين سنه 1187م بعد انتصار صلاح الدين الايوبي في معركه حطين. ازال صلاح الدين ما احدثه الصليبيون من تغييرات فيها اثناء الاحتلال. بدات المدينه في العوده الى ازدهارها خاصه في زمن المماليك الذين خلفوا الايوبيين.\nضرب نابلس زلزال كبير سنه 1189 م، فتهدمت فيها مبان كثيره، ومات تحت الانقاض ثلاثون الفاً من اهلها.\nكانت نابلس مركز تجمع جيش المسلمين بقياده الملك الكامل خلال الحمله الصليبيه السادسه على الشام التي انطلقت في عام 1228م بقياده فردريك الثاني امبراطور المانيا وايطاليا.\nسقطت نابلس بيد التتار سنه 1260م، ولكنهم خرجوا في نفس السنه على يد قطز المملوكي.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nفي سنه 1517 م سيطر العثمانيون على بلاد الشام وبضمنها نابلس، واصبحت نابلس سنجقاً تابعاً لولايه دمشق، ووصلت المدينه اوج ازدهارها في عهدهم.\n\nكانت نابلس خلال القرنين الثامن عشر والتاسع عشر اهم مدينه تجاريه في فلسطين، متفوقه على القدس وعلى المدن الساحليه، ومن المحتمل انها كانت الاكبر سكانيا في فلسطين في هذا الوقت. حوالي عام 1849، وصل عدد سكانها الى عشرين الفًا على الاقل، ما جعلها الاكبر سكانيًا في فلسطين. كانت ايضاً اكبر مركز لانتاج القطن في الشام بكميه بلغت 225,000 كغم عام 1837. كانت المدينه مركزا لتجاره الاقمشه وكانت تصدر الصابون وزيت الزيتون والقطن الى دمشق وبيروت ومصر واوروبا.</\"ref name=\"BD> نتيجه لدورها التجاري المهم، تعرضت نابلس بدءاً من عام 1773 الى حصار عسكري واقتصادي تبعه احتلال قام به ظاهر العمر وخلفه احمد باشا الجزار لاضعاف دورها وتقويه دور عكا، ودام هذا الاحتلال حتى عام 1804. بعد دمار عكا الذي نتج عن هجوم ابراهيم باشا عام 1931-1932، عاده اهميه للازدياد مجددا. في سنه 1832 دخلت نابلس تحت الحكم المصري بقياده القائد ابراهيم باشا، وفي عام 1834 ثار اهل نابلس على الحكم المصري بسبب الضرائب والتجنيد الاجباري ولكنهم اخفقوا. دام هذا الحكم حتى سنه 1840 حيث عادت فلسطين الى الحكم العثماني. وفي نهايه الحكم العثماني اصبحت مدينه نابلس مركز سنجق تابع لولايه بيروت يمتد من نهر الاردن الى البحر المتوسط ويضم مئه قريه. ضرب زلزال كبير ثان نابلس في عام 1837 وادى الى تدمير حي كامل واحداث اضرار كبيره بحي اخر.\nمع نهايه القرن التاسع عشر، بدا دور نابلس بالتراجع مع زياده اهميه مدن اخرى مثل القدس التي اجتذبت مهاجرين يهود وحجاج مسيحيين، ويافا التي بدات بالازدهار نتيجه زياده تجارتها عبر الميناء.</\"ref name=\"BD> استمر التراجع في القرنين اللاحقين بفعل الاحتلال الاجنبي وانتقال مراكز الاداره والتجاره الى مدن اخرى. سقطت نابلس بيد البريطانيين في يوم 21 ايلول 1918 بعد معركه شهدت مقاومه شديده من الجنود العثمانيين. اخضعت فلسطين للانتداب البريطاني عام 1922 واصبحت نابلس مجدداً مركزاً للمقاومه. فجر البريطانيون اجزاءً كبيرهً من حاره القريون خلال ثوره 1936-1939 لقمع المقاومه.\n\nضرب زلزال قوي نابلس يوم 11 تموز من عام 1927  وادى الى تدمير 300 بيت ومبنى في مدينتها القديمه وبضمنها جامع النصر التاريخي  ويمكن رؤيه اثاره على كثير من المباني حتى اليوم. اظهر تعداد عام 1941 ان نابلس جاءت في المرتبه السادسه في تعداد السكان في فلسطين بعد القدس وتل ابيب وحيفا ويافا وغزه على الترتيب، وكانت تضم محكمتين عدليتين على الاقل.\n\nبعد نكبه فلسطين\nبعد نكبه فلسطين عام 1948 ضمت الضفه الغربيه بمحافظاتها الثلاث، نابلس والقدس والخليل، الى الاردن واصبحت في سنه 1950 جزءاً من المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه حتى احتلالها من قبل الاسرائيليين خلال حرب حزيران عام 1967م. منذ سقوطها حتى اليوم، شكلت نابلس احدى اهم بؤر المقاومه وسقط منها شهداء كثر من اقدمهم وابرزهم شاديه ابو غزاله عام 1968 والفتاه لينا النابلسي عام 1976. بعد اتفاق اوسلو، انسحبت قوات الاحتلال منها في 10 كانون الاول سنه 1995م، قبل اربعه ايام من الموعد المتفق عليه مع السلطه الفلسطينيه، وكانت الوحيده من بين المدن الفلسطينيه التي اخليت قبل موعدها.\n\nفي ظل السلطه الفلسطينيه\nفي ظل السلطه الفلسطينيه، استمر دور المدينه بالتراجع بسبب الحصار الاسرائيلي والعمليات العسكريه في مقابل الهدوء النسبي في مناطق اخرى (اهمها رام الله) وتركيز السلطه الفلسطينيه على بناء عاصمتها الجديده في رام الله، فانتقلت كثير من المؤسسات وادارات المصارف والشركات والمراكز الثقافيه ومراكز البحوث الى رام الله. نتيجه لذلك، ارتفعت نسبه البطاله في نابلس وتراجعت تجارتها. كانت الادارات الاقليميه للمصارف الاردنيه العامله في الضفه الغربيه اول من انتقلت من المدينه. بعد ذلك، بدات المؤسسات الثقافيه ودور الابحاث بالانتقال للاقتراب من مراكز صنع القرار في رام الله. على سبيل المثال، انتقل المركز الفلسطيني للبحوث السياسيه والمسحيه (وهو من اوائل مراكز البحوث واستطلاع الراي في فلسطين) من نابلس الى رام الله (وكان اسمه عند التاسيس مركز البحوث والدراسات الفلسطينيه). ايضا، قبل اقامه السلطه الفلسطينيه في رام الله، كانت هناك ثلاثه مراكز ثقافيه فرنسيه (تتبع للقنصليه الفرنسيه في القدس) في الاراضي الفلسطينيه (في القدس وغزه ونابلس)، وبعد اقامه السلطه الفلسطينيه في رام الله اقيم فرع رابع هناك تبعه اغلاق فرع المركز في نابلس.\n\nنابلس في ادب الرحلات\nذكر رحاله كثر نابلس في اعمالهم. من هؤلاء المقدسي في القرن العاشر الميلادي الذي وصفها في كتابه «احسن التقاسيم في معرفه الاقاليم» حيث قال: \n\nفي سنه 1325م زارها ابن بطوطه فوصفها بانها مدينه عظيمه كثيره الاشجار والماء ومن اكثر بلاد الشام زيتوناً، وبها مسجد جامع متقن وحسن في وسطه بركه ماء عذب.\nفي القرن التاسع الهجري، افاض مجير الدين الحنبلي العليمي في ذكر نابلس ونواحيها فقال فيما قال: \n\nفي سنه 1671م زارها الرحاله العثماني اولياجلبي، حيث ذكر انها مركز لواء تابع لولايه دمشق ويضم مائتي قريه. وذكر مساجدها وسوقها ومدارسها وحماماتها قائلاً: \n\n واغلب الظن انه قصد وجود الليمون والنخيل في غور نابلس وليس في جبالها.\n\nالاقتصاد والخدمات\nنابلس عاصمه فلسطين الاقتصاديه، وتعتبر المركز التجاري والصناعي الرئيس في فلسطين قبل النكبه  وفي الضفه الغربيه بعد ذلك. اضافهً الى ذلك، وهبها موقعها الجغرافي المميز وامطارها الغزيره (التي تعتبر الاغزر في فلسطين) اهميه كمركز لانتاج وتبادل المنتجات الزراعيه. كما تشتهر المدينه بصناعه الصابون والمصنوعات اليدويه والاثاث والبلاط وتشتهر بجوده حجارتها ومهاره حجّاريها ومصانع النسيج ودباغه الجلود. كما توجد على تخوم نابلس سوق لتبادل البضائع الحيّه كالمواشي وسوق الخضار المركزيه للضفه الغربيه. تضم نابلس الادارات العامه لكبريات الشركات الفلسطينيه مثل شركه الاتصالات الفلسطينيه وشركه فلسطين للتنميه والاستثمار (PADICO)، وفيها مقر بورصه نابلس المعروفه رسمياً بسوق فلسطين للاوراق الماليه. كانت نابلس مركزاً للادارات الاقليميه للمصارف الفلسطينيه والعربيه الموجوده في الضفه الغربيه قبل ان يتم نقل معظمها الى رام الله مع تاسيس السلطه الفلسطينيه هناك. تشتهر نابلس كذلك بعماره اسواقها، وخاصه في حي القصبه في المدينه القديمه، كما تشتهر بحلوياتها وخاصه «الكنافه» التي تنسب اجودها للمدينه.\n\nالصناعه\nكانت المدينه تشكل ثقلاً اقتصادياً هاماً قبل 1967م وكانت مدن الضفتين تعتمد عليها في بعض الصناعات وبعد الاحتلال ونتيجه لسياسه سلطات الاحتلال الالحقايه التي تقوم على تدمير الاقتصاد الوطني تعرضت الصناعات الكبيره فيها الى التراجع وهبوط مستوى انتاجها واهم هذه الصناعات مصانع الجلود والنسيج والكيمياويات والصناعات المعدنيه، وفي المدينه غرفه تجاره اسست عام 1943م.\nتشتهر المدينه بالكثير من المنتجات الزراعيه والمصنعه اهمها:\n\nالصابون النابلسي: ازدهرت صناعه الصابون في نابلس واشتهر صابونها الذي يصنع من زيت الزيتون حتى اصبحت مصابنها جزءاً من تراث المدينه. كانت صناعه الصابون احد اعمده الاقتصاد النابلسي ووصل عدد المصابن الى اكثر من ثلاثين مصبنه، توقف معظمها عن العمل بفعل اغلاق الاسواق الخارجيه وغياب الابتكار والتجديد.\nالحلويات النابلسيه: اهم حلوياتها على الاطلاق الكنافه النابلسيه الشهيره في كل انحاء المشرق العربي وتركيا. دخلت نابلس موسوعه غينيس للارقام القياسيه باكبر طبق (صدر) كنافه في 18 تموز 2009. تشتهر نابلس ايضاً بالمدلوقه والحلاوه المصنوعه من السمسم والكلاج والقطايف والفطير وحلاوه الزلابيه اضافه الى الحلويات الشاميه مثل البقلاوه.\nمن المُنتجات الاخرى التي تمتاز بها نابلس عن غيرها الجبن النابلسي والطحينه والحلاوه والقزحه، والاخيره عباره عن مائع اسود اللون يستخلص من حبه البركه، يؤكل غمساً وله استعمالات طبيه مهمه.\n\nالزراعه في محافظه نابلس\nتساهم الزراعه بنسبه قليله من الدخل، ويتركز الانتاج الزراعي على سفوح الجبال وفي الاغوار وتعتمد على مياه الامطار والري في الاغوار. فيها العديد من المزارع لتنميه الثروه الحيوانيه.\nتعد نابلس مركز زراعه الزيتون في فلسطين، ولهذا ازدهرت فيها صناعه الصابون النابلسي المطبوخ من زيت الزيتون. اضافه الى الزيتون، تحيط بنابلس بساتين الرمان واللوز والخوخ والمشمش والدراق. تزرع الخضراوات والحمضيات المرويه في الغور حيث تقل اخطار الصقيع. كانت منطقه نابلس تشتهر ايضاً بزراعه القطن، الا ان هذا المحصول اختفى تقريباً الان من منطقه نابلس، ولكنه لا زال يزرع في السهل الساحلي.\nتشتهر المدينه ايضاً بمنتجات زراعيه خاصه مثل الزعتر النابلسي وتعرف بمنتجاتها الجبليه مثل البابونج والميرميه. صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات واسعه من اراضي المحافظه واقامت عليها 43 مستوطنه مما ادى الى انحسار مساحه المراعي الطبيعيه.\n\nالخدمات الصحيه\nفيها مشفيان حكوميان اولهما المستشفى الوطني الذي يٌقدم خدمات في تخصص علم الاورام. بني هذا المستشفى عام 1910 ويقع في وسط المدينه. ثاني المستشفيات الحكوميه مستشفى رفيديا الجراحي الذي يقع في غرب المدينه ويُعد اكبر مستشفى في المدينه. يوجد ايضاً مشفيان خاصان غير ربحيين هما المستشفى الانجيلي العربي وهو الاقدم في المدينه حيث انشيء عام 1900 ومستشفى جمعيه الاتحاد النسائي العربي.. من المشافي الخاصه الربحيه المستشفى العربي التخصصي ومستشفى نابلس التخصصي الذي اسس عام 2001، ويقدم خدمات اختصاصيه في جراحه القلب المفتوح وقثطره شريانيه وراب الوعاء. بعد انشاء كليه الطب في جامعه النجاح انشيء مستشفى النجاح الوطني الجامعي وهو اول مستشفى جامعي في فلسطين.\nاضافه الى ما تقدم، هناك مستوصفات خيريه تقدم خدمات الطوارئ والاسعافات الاوليه مثل مستوصف الرحمه ومستوصف التضامن التابع لجمعيه التضامن الخيريه ومركز الرازي الطبي ومركز الامل للتاهيل. هناك ايضاً العديد من العيادات الطبيه الحكوميه او التابعه لوكاله غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين او الاونروا، وخاصه في مخيمات اللاجئين. في عام 2010، بلغ معدل السكان لكل مركز رعايه صحيه 5,486 مواطن وهو الرقم الاصغر مُقارنه مع باقي المدن الفلسطينيه. ويتمتع المواطن النابلسي بخاصيه التامين الصحي الذي يتم تامينه من جهه الحكومه (نظام التامين الصحي الحكومي) والتامين الصحي الخاص والمنظمات الغير حكوميه والاونروا ايضًا ويصل عدد العائلات التي تستفيد من هذا التامين 19,051 عائله.\n\nالخدمات البلديه\nفي عام 1997، تم ربط 18,003 منزل بالشبكه العامه للكهرباء اي ما يعادل 99,7% من المدينه. قبل بناء هذه الشبكه عام 1957 كان التزود بالكهرباء يتم عن طريق بعض المولدات الخاصه. بالاضافه ان الشبكه تمد 18 بلده وقريه بجوار المدينه بالكهرباء عن طريق نفس الشبكه.\nوترتبط 93% من منازل المدينه بنظام الصرف الصحي و7% عن طريق الحُفر الامتصاصيه. واُنشئ نظام الصرف الصحي في اوائل الخمسينات، بالاضافه الى ارتباط مخيم بلاطه ومخيم عسكر ومخيم عين بيت الماء. وتوفر بلديه نابلس المياه الصحيه عن طريق الانابيب لجميع المنازل في المدينه. وقد قامت السلطات البريطانيه بتاسيس شبكه المياه عام 1932، وتتزود بالمياه من الابار الاربعه المجاوره للمدينه في: دير شرف، الفارعه، وادي الباذان و‌اودلا.\n\nاطفائيه البلديه\nتم تاسيس اطفائيه بلديه نابلس عام 1958. حيث تالفت اول فرقه اطفاء من خمسه افراد مع سياره اطفاء واحده، حتى عام 1986 كانت مسؤوله عن منطقه شمال الضفه الغربيه كاملهً. ولكن اليوم تقتصر خدماتها فقط في نابلس. في عام 2007، بلغ عدد السيارات المُستعمله لاطفاء الحرائق 20 سياره و70 فرد. خلال الفتره الواقعه ما بين 1997 و2006، قامت باطفاء 15,346 حريق.\n\nالطرق والمواصلات\nينقسم نظام الطرق والمواصلات في نابلس كما هو الحال في باقي مناطق الضفه الغربيه الى قسمين رئيسيين، واحد لاستخدام المواطنين الفلسطينيين والاخر لاستخدام المستوطنين الاسرائيليين. تصل مساحه الطرق الرئيسيه التي تربط مدينه نابلس بالقرى المُحيطه بها الى 365.8 كم 2، بينما تصل مساحه الطرق الفرعيه التي تربطها بالقرى الى 313.2 كم 2. ومنذ توقيع اتفاقيه اوسلو بين السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه والجانب الاسرائيلي في ايلول سبتمبر عام 1995 عملت اسرائيل على انشاء نظام طرق خاص يربط مستوطنات الضفه الغربيه ببعضها البعض، ويضمن مرورا امنا لمستوطني الضفه الغربيه. وقد ادى نظام الطرق هذا الى تقسيم الاراضي الزراعيه في الضفه الغربيه وبعثرتها. وقد وصل طول هذه الطرق الى 39,699 كم مربع حتى نهايه شهر مارس من العام 1996.\nتعد المركبات في نابلس اهم وسائل النقل، بل تكاد تكون الوحيده التي يعتمد عليها سكان نابلس للتنقل برًا من والى المناطق المختلفه داخل الوطن والمدن المجاوره. حيث تبلغ عدد السيارات 20.397 منها 15.507 سياره خاصه و1.490 سياره اجره و121 حافله عموميه. ويعتبر متوسط سنه انتاج السياره منخفضًا في المدينه حيث يبلغ عدد السيارات التي تم تصنيعها (قبل عام 1997) 9.540 سياره اي ما يقارب نصفها.\n\nالحياه الثقافيه والتراث\nتعتبر نابلس من اغنى المدن الفلسطينيه ثقافياً وتراثياً. من الالقاب التي عرفت بها نابلس «عش العلماء» ويعود سبب التسميه الى كون نابلس مركزاً علمياً وادبياً ونظراً لظهور الكثير من العلماء والادباء والشعراء منها على مدى كثير من العصور.\n\nشعراؤها وادباؤها\nبرز منها الكثير من اعلام الفكر والشعر والادب. من اشهر شعرائها ابراهيم طوقان شاعر فلسطين وشقيقته فدوى طوقان وحلمي الزواتي وعبد اللطيف عقل وليلى علوش وعلي الخليلي ومحمد مهيب جبر ومن ادبائها في القرن العشرين عادل زعيتر وقدري طوقان ومحمد عزه دروزه وثريا ملحس واكرم زعيتر.\n\nمؤسسات التعليم العالي والمراكز الثقافيه\nتحتضن نابلس جامعه النجاح الوطنيه الاكبر في الضفه الغربيه والتي تضم عشرين كليه. توجد في المدينه ايضاً كليه الروضه للعلوم المهنيه اضافهً الى مراكز ثقافيه مثل المنتدى التنويري الثقافي الفلسطيني والنادي الثقافي الاجتماعي ومركز حواء الثقافي وملتقى بلاطه الثقافي والمركز الثقافي الفرنسي وفرع للمجلس الثقافي البريطاني. كان في المدينه ثلاث دور سينما اغلقت خلال الانتفاضات المتعاقبه منذ 1989، وقد افتتحت عام 2009 دار جديده للسينما، اغلقت ابوابها عام 2019. وتعد مكتبه بلديه نابلس العامه اقدم واكبر المكتبات في الضفه الغربيه حيث انشئت عام 1960.\nوفقًا ل الجهاز المركزي للاحصاء الفلسطيني، في عام 1997، بلغ عدد الطلاب 44,926 (41.2٪ في المدارس الابتدائيه، 36.2٪ في المدرسه الثانويه، و22.6٪ في المدرسه الثانويه). في عام 2006، بلغ عدد المدارس 234 مدرسه و93,925 طالبًا وطالبه في محافظه نابلس؛ منها 196 تابعه لمديريه التربيه والتعليم الفلسطينيه و24 مدرسه خاصه و14 مدرسه تابعه ل الاونروا.\n\nالحركه النسويه\nفي عام 1921، تاسست في نابلس جمعيه الاتحاد النسائي العربي التي كانت اول جمعيه نسائيه غير دينيه في فلسطين (سبقتها ثلاث جمعيات ارثوذكسيه في عكا ويافا والقدس)، وهي لا تزال نشطه حتى الان واسست الكثير من المراكز والنشاطات منها مشفى ومعهد تمريض ومراكز تعليم مهني وناد ثقافي وروضه اطفال.\n\nالمتاحف\nانشئ في نابلس متحف القصبه في موقع غني بالاثار الرومانيه داخل المدينه القديمه. هناك ايضاً متحف سامري اقيم على قمه جبل جرزيم عام 1997 لالقاء الضوء على ديانه وتراث السامريين.\n\nالانتاج التلفزيوني ومحطات البث التلفزيوني\nتم في نابلس عام 2005 انتاج مسلسل تلفزيوني يعالج الكثير من القضايا الاجتماعيه وكان اسم المسلسل «براويز» من انتاج تلفزيون اسيا ـ نابلس، كذلك انتج مسلسل تلفزيوني اجتماعي اخر عام 2008 حمل عنوان «لهون حلو». فيها سبع محطات تلفزه محليه اهمها واولها تلفزيون نابلس وخمس محطات اذاعه محليه تبث على موجات اف ام، وهي تؤثر بشكل فاعل بطرح قضايا تخص المدينه وسكانها، من ابرز هذه الاذاعات راديو شباب اف ام، راديو طريق المحبه، اذاعه جامعه النجاح الوطنيه واذاعه القران الكريم.\n\nالزي الشعبي\nيشبه الزي النسائي القديم المعروف لمدينه نابلس الى حد كبير الزي النسائي لمدينه دمشق، والذي يتكون من يشمك وغطوه وكاب او ملايه. والحال كذلك بالنسبه للزي الرجالي الذي كان يتكون من الشروال والطربوش.\n\nالفن التشكيلي\nاقيمت في مدينه نابلس اضخم جداريه في فلسطين بمساحه 550 متر مربع عند مفترق جامع السلام غرب المدينه. كما اقيم في مدينه نابلس حديثا غالري فني يهتم بالفن التشكيلي بكافه انواعه وهو غالري تهامه.\n\nالرياضه\nتوجد في المدينه العديد من الانديه الرياضيه اهمها نادي حطين ونادي اتحاد نابلس ونادي عيبال وشباب نابلس، اضافه الى انديه صغيره مثل نادي اهلي بلاطه ونادي التضامن ونادي جبل النار ونادي اسكان الموظفين. اضافهً الى ذلك، يوجد مركز للشباب في كل مخيم للاجئين (كبلاطه وعسكر وعين بيت الماء). فيها ملعب بلدي لكره القدم هو الاقدم في فلسطين حيث اسس عام 1950. جرت توسعته واعاده تاهيله ليتسع ل4,000 من المتفرجين.\n\nالحديقه النباتيه\nاقيمت اول حديقه نباتيه تعليميه وبحثيه في فلسطين في قريه تل الواقعه في ضواحي نابلس. اشرف على هذا المشروع ونفذه مركز ابحاث التنوع الحيوي والبيئه «بيرك» ويقع مقره في ذات القريه. تحتوي الحديقه على اشجار الحور، عروس الغابه، الخروب، البطم، الجكرندا، الطلح الناعم، السنديان، العبهر، الصنوبر، الكينا، التين، الزيزفون السوري، الورود، بالاضافه الى حديقه مائيه وحديقه صخريه.\n\nاهميتها الدينيه\nاخرج ابن ابي شيبه عن كعب الاحبار قال: \n\n هي من اهم المدن قداسه وخاصه عند اليهود والنصارى. يقال ان النبي ادم سجد فيها على جبل جرزيم. هي الموقع الكنعاني الاول الذي ذكرته التوراه وفيه بنى ابراهيم اول هيكل لدى قدومه من حلب. اضافه الى ابراهيم، سكنها انبياء اهمهم اسحاق ويعقوب. ويعتقد اليهود ان ابراهيم همّ بذبح اسحاق على جبل جرزيم. مر بها المسيح حيث سقته المراه السامريه من بئر يعقوب. يوجد فيها ايضاً قبر يوسف وبظاهرها قبور انبياء اخرين.\nهناك 17 معلما اسلاميّا في المدينه، و11 مسجدًا في المدينه القديمه. تمّ انشاء 9 مساجد من هذه المذكوره قبل القرن الخامس عشر. تحوي نابلس، بالاضافه لدور العباده الاسلاميه، كنيسه للروم الارثوذكس مكرسه للقديس جوستين الشهيد، المبنيه عام 1898، وكنيسًا للسامريين، لا يزال يُستعمل من قبل تابعي هذه الديانه.\n\nالمساجد\nنابلس مدينه المساجد، فمنذ ان دخلها الاسلام وهي جاده في بناء المساجد التي بنى معظمها الموسرون من اهلها حيث تفيد احصائيه من عام 1997م بان عدد المساجد في مدينه نابلس وحدها دون قراها بلغ 49 مسجدًا  منها ما هو قديم جداً مثل جامع الخضراء، الذي يمتد عمره الى بدايه العهد الاسلامي،جامع التينه، جامع البيك، الجامع الصلاحي الكبير الذي كان كاتدرائيه، جامع الساطون، جامع النصر، المسجد العمري، جامع المساكين، المسجد الحنبلي، جامع الانبياء، جامع الخضر، مسجد العامود. وهناك عدد كبير من المساجد الحديثه.\nتوجد في نابلس لجنه زكاه تعتبر الاكبر في الضفه الغربيه حيث تقوم على اعاله الاف الاسر والايتام وطلاب العلم في نابلس وقراها وتشرف على عده مشاريع استثماريه ضخمه متعدده الاغراض.\n\nالكنائس والاديره\nتمتاز نابلس بتسامحها الديني، وهذا يفسر كثره الكنائس وتنوعها وكذلك الاديره المسيحيه فيها. ومن اشهر الكنائس واقدمها في نابلس كنيسه الارثوذكس في المدينه القديمه، والكنيسه الارثوذكسيه المُقامه فوق بئر يعقوب. ومن اشهر اديرتها دير فنشر قرب جامع الخضر، ودير اللاتين قرب المقبره الغربيه. وهناك موقع شرقي المدينه يسمى خله الرهبان.\n\nاثار ومعالم\nلا تزال مجموعه من المباني الاثريه والتاريخيه الجميله الممثله لمختلف الفترات التاريخيه السابقه التي مرت على نابلس قائمه حتى اليوم داخل المدينه، فبالاضافه الى مدينه شكيم، لا يزال هناك ثلاثه عشر اثراً رومانياً من ابرزها المسرح والمدرج وميدان سباق الخيل، كما ان هناك خمسه وستين اثراً لمعالم التراث الحضاري الاسلامي موزعه على المساجد، المقامات، الزوايا، الخانات، القصور، الاسبله، المدارس وغير ذلك. ومما يؤسف له ان هذه الاثار قد تعرضت للتدمير والهدم والتخريب الوحشي على يد الاسرائيليين اثناء هجومهم على البلده القديمه في نابلس عام 2002.\n\nبوابات نابلس\nيروي مؤرخو المدينه ان نابلس كان لها ثماني عشره بوابه، زال معظمها جراء التوسع العمراني الذي شهدته ابتداءً من القرن التاسع عشر. ومنها: البوابه الشرقيه، البوابه الغربيه، بوابه الدير، بوابه الشيخ مسلم، بوابه ادريس، بوابه سوق الحدادين، بوابه البيك وسط المدينه القديمه، بوابه الوكاله.\n\nالمعالم من العهدين الكنعاني والروماني\nتظهر الاثار الرومانيه على اطراف المدينه القديمه، وبعض المعالم في البلده القديمه ترجع الى العهد البيزنطي والصليبي. من الاثار الكنعانيه والرومانيه المهمه في نابلس:\n\nسبسطيه: مدينه اثريه فيها مدارج رومانيه وشارع اعمده. تقع على بعد كيلومترات قليله شمال غرب نابلس.\nشكيم: مدينه كنعانيه قديمه. بعض جدرانها لا تزال قائمهً الى اليوم في الطرف الشرقي من مدينه نابلس.\nمعبد جوبيتر او زيوس: ويقع في تل الراس في جبل جرزيم (الطور). اُسس كمعبد للالهه زيوس في القرن الثاني للميلاد وقد تم اكتشافه عام 1930.\nمدرج سباق الخيل في ساحه الشهداء (ميدان الحسين سابقاً) وسط مدينه نابلس.\nالمدرج الروماني في راس العين: ويتسع لاكثر من الف شخص، وهو اكبر المسارح المكتشفه في فلسطين.\nالشارع الروماني: اكتشفت اجزاء منه تحت مدرسه ظافر المصري في حاره القيساريه.\nمقبره عسكر البيزنطيه.\nالمقبره الرومانيه الغربيه: وتقع على اطراف المدينه على الطريق المتجه غربًا نحو الساحل الفلسطيني.\nبئر يعقوب: وهو البئر الذي شرب منه يسوع على يد المراه السامريه بحسب التقاليد المسيحيه، واقيم فوقه دير ارثوذكسي، ولا يزال عامراً بالمياه الصالحه للشرب.\nقبر يوسف: هو مقام يعتقد ان القبر الموجود فيه يحتوي رفات النبي يوسف بن يعقوب التي حملت من مصر حسب التوراه،  ولذلك استولى عليه اليهود عام 1967 وجعلوه مقاماً مقدساً لديهم ونقطهً عسكريه قبل ان يطردهم سكان نابلس بالقوه عام 2000.\n\nقناه جر المياه الرومانيه: اقام الرومان هذه القناه في القرن الثاني الميلادي واكتشفت حديثاً على عمق 30 متراً تحت الارض تحت اقسام من المدينه القديمه عند بناء مدرسه ظافر المصري في حاره القيساريه. يُعتقد ان هذه القناه تجر مياه الشرب من ينابيع جبل جرزيم ضمن شبكه من الخزانات والابار،  ولا تزال المياه تتدفق في هذه القناه. تم ترميم جزء منها وفتحه للزوار من قبل بلديه المدينه قبل عده سنوات.\nاربع كنائس بيزنطيه حولت الى مساجد.\nاثار جبل جرزيم. يوجد على قمه الجبل معبد يوناني وكنيسه بيزنطيه مثمنه الاضلاع وقلعه صليبيه ومقام اسلامي اضافه الى خزانات مياه واساسات ابنيه.\nتله صوفر.\n\nقبور الانبياء في عورتا. فيها قبر النبي العزير في مغاره وكذلك قبر يوشع بن نون خادم النبي موسى ومفضل ابن عم النبي هارون.\n\nالمعالم من العهد الاسلامي\nتتمثل اهم الاثار الاسلاميه في احياء المدينه القديمه في نابلس، وهي الياسمينه، القريون، الحبله، القيساريه، العقبه، الغرب، القصبه الذي يمثل شريان المدينه القديمه ومركزها التجاري.\nتحتوي نابلس على 2850 بناءً تاريخيًا من منازل وقصور عائليه، و18 معلماً اسلامياً و17 سبيلاً. يعود تاريخ انشاء العديد من الاماكن التاريخيه المهمه الى العهد الاسلامي وبالاخص العثماني مثل:\n\nبرج الساعه في باب الساحه\nخان التجار القديم\nخان التجار الجديد\nخان الوكاله الغربيه\nالمدرسه الرشاديه او المدرسه الفاطميه\nقصر النمر\nالمناره\nمستشفى الوطني الحكومي\nالمستشفى الانجيلي (المبنيان القديمان)\nسجن النساء التركي\nالسجن (القشله)\nسرايا الحكم التركي\nدار المفتي\nالوكاله الفروخيه\nمحطه ضخ مياه القريون\nالبرج الصليبي\nجسر القطار قرب حدائق جمال عبد الناصر ومحطه القطار\nالمدرسه الهاشميه (هدمت)\nالمحكمه الشرعيه.\nاضافه الى ذلك، تضم المدينه العديد من الاثار والمعالم القديمه، منها تسعه مساجد اثريه، اربع منها كانت كنائس بيزنطيه بالاصل وحولت الى مساجد، وخمسه مساجد بنيت في بدايه العهد الاسلامي، وضريح يعود الى الفتره الايوبيه، وكنيسه من القرن السابع عشر وعشرات المصابن.\nيقع مقام رجال العامود على سفح جبل جرزيم الشمالي، ويعود تاريخه الى عام 1396، ويتكون من سبع غرف متلاصقه يعتقد انها كانت مسكن عامود النور وعائلته، ويوجد في الغرف الوسطى قبور يعتقد ان اصحاب المقام قد دفنوا فيها لاحقًا، وله فناء داخلي وسور، وفي جزئه الشمالي الغربي مسجد صغير تعلوه قبه حجريه.\n\nالحمامات التركيه\nما زالت الحمامات التركيه في نابلس شاهدهً على قدم هذه المدينه وعراقتها. كان عدد الحمامات التركيه في نابلس اكبر من ايه مدينه اخرى في فلسطين، حيث كانت تضم عشره حمامات تركيه  من اصل 38 في كل فلسطين. مع التطور العمراني ووصول المياه الجاريه الى البيوت، تضاءلت اهميه الحمامات العامه فهجر بعضها او تضرر بسبب الاهمال بينما تحولت حمامات اخرى الى مرافق مختلفه مثل حمام الخليلي، حمام الريشه، حمام الدرجه، حمام القاضي، حمام التميمي، وحمام النساء. تم خلال السنوات العشر الماضيه تجديد بعض الحمامات التركيه مثل حمام السمره وحمام الشفاء. واضافه الى وظيفتها الاساسيه، اصبحت هذه الحمامات تشكل ملتقيات للسكان من مختلف الاعمار حيث تشهد اقامه فعاليات ثقافيه وتراثيه.\n\nالتخريب الاسرائيلي للمعالم الاثريه في نابلس\nتعرضت المباني والمعالم التاريخيه في نابلس لاضرار كبيره من قبل الاحتلال الاسرائيلي، حيث دمر 149 معلماً من هذه المعالم بالكامل بينما تعرض 2000 معلم، ابرزها جامع الخضراء الذي يقدر عمره بـ 400 سنه، وخان الوكاله  لاضرار متنوعه اثناء عمليات الجيش الاسرائيلي في المدينه منذ بدايه الانتفاضه الثانيه عام 2000 وخاصه اثناء عمليتها الكبرى في نابلس في نيسان 2002. واصاب الضرر قصورًا اثريه ومساجد ومصابن واسواق.\n\nدور نابلس في النضال القومي العربي والوطني الفلسطيني\nكانت نابلس على الدوام مركزاً للنضال الوطني والقومي حيث لعبت دوراً كبيراً في مقاومه الغزاه. وحسب قسطنطين بازيلي فان «جبليي نابلس هم اكثر القبائل السوريه ضراوه ونزوعاً للقتال.»  لعب مثقفو نابلس واعيانها ادورا كبيره في الكفاح القومي. على سبيل المثال، كان عدد الاجمال للاعضاء في المنظمات والانديه القوميه التي شكلت حتى نهايه الحرب العالميه الاولى 126 عضوا (مثلوا سوريه والعراق)، كان منهم ثلاثه عشر عضوا من نابلس ومنطقتها، وهو اعلى تمثيل من فلسطين متبوعا بالقدس التي مثلها تسعه اعضاء. كان معظم هؤلاء ناشطين في جمعيه العربيه الفتاه وعلى راسهم عوني عبد الهادي ومحمد عزه دروزه. شارك مندوبون عن نابلس في المؤتمر السوري العام الذي عقد في دمشق عام 1920 والقى محمد عزه دروزه مقررات المؤتمر التي اعلنت استقلال سوريه بحدودها الطبيعيه ونادت بفيصل بن الحسين ملكا عليها.\nمن اهم الاحداث التي شهدتها نابلس المؤتمر الفلسطيني الخامس من 20 الى 24 اب 1922 والذي اعلن الفلسطينيون خلاله رفض الانتداب واصدار طوابع عليها شعارات فلسطينيه ومقاطعه اليهود في البيع والشراء. لمتابعه المؤتمر عقد في نابلس مؤتمر اخر بتاريخ 18 ايلول 1931 سمي بمؤتمر التسليح، حيث طالب بالاستقلال والوحده العربيه ودعا الى مقاطعه حكومه الانتداب وتسليح عرب فلسطين ان لم تستجب لذلك.\n\nنابلس في الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه\nتعتبر مدينه نابلس اكثر المدن الفلسطينيه تعرضًا للحصار والضربات العسكريه من قبل الجيش الاسرائيلي خلال الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه ابتداءً من العام 2000. ادى الحصار المستمر للمدينه وصعوبه تبادل البضائع الى تدهور مكانه المدينه كمركز اقتصادي، وادى الى ارتفاع نسب البطاله كثيرًا، مما ادى الى هجره العديد من سكانها الى الخارج او الى مدن اخرى خاصه رام الله. تصف اسرائيل المدينه بانها «مصنع للارهابيين»، وقامت قوات الجيش الاسرائيلي بعده عمليات عسكريه واسعه النطاق في المدينه او عمليات شملت عده مناطق من ضمنها مدينه نابلس من اشهرها عمليه الدرع الواقي عام 2002 وذلك نتيجه عدد الاستشهاديين الذين خرجوا منها. كانت نابلس الاكثر تضرراً من بين المحافظات الفلسطينيه على صعيد الخسائر الاقتصاديه حيث سجلت 2630 منشاه غير عامله من بين العدد الكلي للمنشات (17,167) او ما نسبته 15% من المنشات فيها وفق نتائج تعداد 2007،  وهذه اعلى نسبه سجلت في فلسطين.\n\nاعلام نابلس\nعلى الصعيد القومي\nخرج من نابلس شعراء وكتاب ورجال سياسه واقتصاد منهم من تبوا مناصب رفيعه على مستوى فلسطين والاردن

      "summary": "نَابُلُس إحدى أكبر المدن الفلسطينية سكانًا وأهمها موقعًا. وهي مقر جامعة النجاح الوطنية أكبر الجامعات الفلسطينية. تعتبر نابلس مركزاً لشمال الضفة الغربية إضافةً إلى كونها عاصمة لمحافظة نابلس التي تضم 56 قرية ويُقدر عدد سكانها بقرابة (388,321) نسمة حسب إحصاءات عام 2017. تُعرف أيضا بأسماء جبل النار ودمشق الصغرى وعش العلماء وملكة فلسطين غير المتوجة. لعبت المدينة أدوارًا مهمة خلال النزاعات في بلاد الشام، ويعتقد أنها كانت أكبر مدينة في فلسطين في أواسط القرن الثامن عشر والنصف الأول من القرن التاسع عشر.\nفي القرنين الخامس والسادس للميلاد أدّى نزاع بين سكان المدينة من السامريين والمسيحيين إلى بروز عدد من الانتفاضات السامرية ضد الحكم البيزنطي، قبل أن تقوم الإمبراطورية بإخماد ثوراتهم هذه بالعنف، مما أدى لاضمحلال عددهم في المدينة.\nفتح العرب المسلمون، في زمن خلافة أبي بكر الصديق، هذه المدينة وباقي فلسطين وبلاد الشام، وفي هذا العهد عُرّب اسمها ليصبح نابلس بدلاً من نيابوليس، وازداد عدد المسلمين من سكانها وأخذت بعض من كنائسها ومعابدها السامرية تتحول إلى مساجد شيئاً فشيئاً، ثم سقطت نابلس تحت الحكم الصليبي عام 1099 قبل أن تعود لحكم المسلمين الأيوبيين والمماليك بعدهم.\nأصبحت نابلس عاصمة سنجق نابلس في العهد العثماني، وكانت في هذه الفترة سنجقا تابعا لإيالة دمشق ثم لإيالة صيدا (التي خلفت إيالة عكا وأجزاء من إيالة دمشق) وأخيرًا ولاية بيروت وفي آخر تقسيم إداري عثماني خضعت المدينة للحكم المصري الذي دام تسع سنوات في بلاد الشام، في العقد الرابع من القرن التاسع عشر، وقبل أن تعود إلى الحكم العثماني. احتلها البريطانيون عندما انهزمت الدولة العثمانية في الحرب العالمية الأولى وخضعت فلسطين للانتداب البريطاني. وسقطت نابلس تحت الاحتلال الإسرائيلي عام 1967 حينها سقطت الضفة الغربية بأكملها.\nتشتهر المدينة القديمة بصناعة الصابون، وبالكنافة النابلسية، التي تعتبر من أشهر الحلويات الشرقية في بلاد الشام، بالإضافة إلى بعض المنتجات الزراعية مثل الزعتر النابلسي والجبن النابلسي.",
