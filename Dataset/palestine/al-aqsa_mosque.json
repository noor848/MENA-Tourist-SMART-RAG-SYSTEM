      "content": "The Aqsa Mosque, also known as the Qibli Mosque or Qibli Chapel, is the main congregational mosque or prayer hall in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem. In some sources the building is also named al-Masjid al-Aqṣā, but this name primarily applies to the whole compound in which the building sits, which is itself also known as \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\". The wider compound is known as Al-Aqsa or Al-Aqsa mosque compound, also known as al-Ḥaram al-Sharīf.\nAccording to Islamic tradition, a small prayer hall (musalla), what would later become the Al-Aqsa Mosque, was built by Umar, the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. In the reign of the caliph Mu'awiyah I of the Umayyad Caliphate (founded in AD 661), a quadrangular mosque for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers is recorded somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif. \nThe present-day mosque, located on the south wall of the compound, was originally built by the fifth Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) or his successor al-Walid I (r. 705–715) (or both) as a congregational mosque on the same axis as the Dome of the Rock, a commemorative Islamic monument. After being destroyed in an earthquake in 746, the mosque was rebuilt in 758 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. It was further expanded upon in 780 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi, after which it consisted of fifteen aisles and a central dome. However, it was again destroyed during the 1033 Jordan Rift Valley earthquake. The mosque was rebuilt by the Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021–1036), who reduced it to seven aisles but adorned its interior with an elaborate central archway covered in vegetal mosaics; the current structure preserves the 11th-century outline.\nDuring the periodic renovations undertaken, the ruling Islamic dynasties constructed additions to the mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, façade, minarets, and minbar and interior structure. Upon its capture by the Crusaders in 1099, the mosque was used as a palace; it was also the headquarters of the religious order of the Knights Templar. After the area was conquered by Saladin in 1187, the structure's function as a mosque was restored. More renovations, repairs, and expansion projects were undertaken in later centuries by the Ayyubids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council of British Palestine, and during the Jordanian rule of the West Bank. Since the beginning of the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the mosque has remained under the independent administration of the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.\n\nDefinition\nThe \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\" translates into \"the Farthest Mosque\" in English.\n\nThe Arabic term \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\" is the translation of both al-Masjid al-Aqṣā and Jāmiʿ al-Aqṣā, which have distinct meanings in Arabic. The former (al-Masjid al-Aqṣā) refers to the Quran's Surah 17 – \"the furthest mosque\" – and thus is used for the whole compound of the Temple Mount, also known as the Haram al-Sharif, while the latter name (Jāmiʿ al-Aqṣā) is used for the subject of this article – the silver-domed congregational mosque building. Arabic and Persian writers such as 10th-century geographer al-Muqaddasi, 11th-century scholar Nasir Khusraw, 12th-century geographer al-Idrisi and 15th-century Islamic scholar Mujir al-Din, as well as 19th-century American and British Orientalists Edward Robinson, Guy Le Strange and Edward Henry Palmer explained that the term Masjid al-Aqsa refers to the entire esplanade plaza also known as the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif ('Noble Sanctuary') – i.e. the entire area including the Dome of the Rock, the fountains, the gates, and the four minarets – because none of these buildings existed at the time the Quran was written. Al-Muqaddasi referred to the southern building (the subject of this article) as Al Mughattâ (\"the covered-part\") and Nasir Khusraw referred to it with the Persian word Pushish (also the \"covered part\", exactly as \"Al Mughatta\") or the Maqsurah (a part-for-the-whole synecdoche).\nThe building is also referred to as (al-)Qibli Mosque or (al-)Qibli Chapel (Muṣallā al-Qiblī), in reference to its location on the southern end of the compound as a result of the Islamic qibla being moved from Jerusalem to Mecca. \"Qibli\" is the name used in official publications by the governmental organization which administers the site, the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf (part of the Jordanian government), and the Jordanian government more widely. It is also the official name used by the Palestine Liberation Organization. It has been used by numerous international organizations such as the United States State Department the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (whose role is to act as \"the collective voice of the Muslim world\"), and UNESCO, as well as various scholars and media organizations.\n\nHistory\nPre-construction\nThe mosque is located on the southern part of the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif, an enclosure expanded by King Herod the Great beginning in 20 BCE during his reconstruction of the Second Jewish Temple. The mosque resides on an artificial platform that is supported by arches constructed by Herod's engineers to overcome the difficult topographic conditions resulting from the southward expansion of the enclosure into the Tyropoeon and Kidron valleys. During the late Second Temple period, the present site of the mosque was occupied by the Royal Stoa, a basilica running the southern wall of the enclosure. The Royal Stoa was destroyed along with the Temple during the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE.\nIt was once thought that Emperor Justinian's \"Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos\", lit. 'the New Church of the God-Bearer' and commonly known as the Nea Church, dedicated to the God-bearing Virgin Mary, consecrated in 543, was situated where al-Aqsa Mosque was later constructed. However, remains identified as those of the Nea Church were uncovered in the south part of the Jewish Quarter in 1973.\nAnalysis of the wooden beams and panels removed from the mosque during renovations in the 1930s shows they are made from Lebanese cedar and cypress. Radiocarbon dating gave a large range of ages, some as old as the 9th century BCE, showing that some of the wood had previously been used in older buildings. However, reexamination of the same beams in the 2010s gave dates in the Byzantine period.\nDuring his excavations in the 1930s, Robert Hamilton uncovered portions of a multicolor mosaic floor with geometric patterns, but did not publish them. The date of the mosaic is disputed: Zachi Dvira considers that they are from the pre-Islamic Byzantine period, while Baruch, Reich and Sandhaus favor a much later Umayyad origin on account of their similarity to a mosaic from an Umayyad palace excavated adjacent to the Temple Mount's southern wall. By comparing the photographs to Hamilton's excavation report, Di Cesare determined that they belong to the second phase of mosque construction in the Umayyad period. Moreover, the mosaic designs were common in Islamic, Jewish and Christian buildings from the 2nd to the 8th century. Di Cesare suggested that Hamilton didn't include the mosaics in his book because they were destroyed to explore beneath them.\n\nUmayyad period\nA mostly wooden, rectangular mosque on the Temple Mount site with a capacity for 3,000 worshippers is attested by the Gallic monk Arculf during his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in c. 679–682. Its precise location is not known. The art historian Oleg Grabar deems it likely that it was close to the present mosque, while the historian Yildirim Yavuz asserts it stood at the present site of the Dome of Rock. The architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell notes that Arculf's attestation lends credibility to claims by some Islamic traditions and medieval Christian chronicles, which he otherwise deems legendary or unreliable, that the second Rashidun caliph, Umar (r. 634–644), ordered the construction of a primitive mosque on the Temple Mount. However, Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of Caliph Mu'awiya I (r. 661–680), founder of the Syria-based Umayyad Caliphate. Mu'awiya had been governor of Syria, including Palestine, for about twenty years before becoming caliph and his accession ceremony was held in Jerusalem. The 10th-century Jerusalemite scholar Ibn Tahir claims Mu'awiya built a mosque on the Haram.\nThere is disagreement as to whether the present al-Aqsa Mosque was originally built by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) or his successor, his son al-Walid I (r. 705–715). Several architectural historians hold that Abd al-Malik commissioned the project and that al-Walid finished or expanded it. Abd al-Malik inaugurated great architectural works on the Temple Mount, including construction of the Dome of the Rock in c. 691. A common Islamic tradition holds that Abd al-Malik simultaneously commissioned the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque. As both were intentionally built on the same axis, Grabar comments that the two structures form \"part of an architecturally thought-out ensemble comprising a congregational and a commemorative building\", the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, respectively. Guy le Strange claims that Abd al-Malik used materials from the destroyed Church of Our Lady to build the mosque and points to possible evidence that substructures on the southeast corners of the mosque are remains of the church.\nThe earliest source indicating al-Walid's work on the mosque is the Aphrodito Papryi. These contain the letters between al-Walid's governor of Egypt in December 708–June 711 and a government official in Upper Egypt which discuss the dispatch of Egyptian laborers and craftsmen to help build the al-Aqsa Mosque, referred to as the \"Mosque of Jerusalem\". The referenced workers spent between six months and a year on the construction. Several 10th and 13th-century historians credit al-Walid for founding the mosque, though the historian Amikam Elad doubts their reliability on the matter. In 713–714, a series of earthquakes ravaged Jerusalem, destroying the eastern section of the mosque, which was subsequently rebuilt by al-Walid's order. He had gold from the Dome of the Rock melted to use as money to finance the repairs and renovations. He is credited by the early 15th-century historian al-Qalqashandi for covering the mosque's walls with mosaics. Grabar notes that the Umayyad-era mosque was adorned with mosaics, marble, and \"remarkable crafted and painted woodwork\". The latter are preserved partly in the Palestine Archaeological Museum and partly in the Islamic Museum.\nEstimates of the size of the Umayyad-built mosque by architectural historians range from 112 by 39 meters (367 ft × 128 ft) to 114.6 by 69.2 meters (376 ft × 227 ft). The building was rectangular. In the assessment of Grabar, the layout was a modified version of the traditional hypostyle mosque of the period. Its \"unusual\" characteristic was that its aisles laid perpendicular to the qibla wall. The number of aisles is not definitively known, though fifteen is cited by a number of historians. The central aisle, double the width of the others, was probably topped by a dome.\nThe last years of Umayyad rule were turbulent for Jerusalem. The last Umayyad caliph, Marwan II (r. 744–750), punished Jerusalem's inhabitants for supporting a rebellion against him by rival princes, and tore down the city's walls. In 746, the al-Aqsa Mosque was ruined in an earthquake. Four years later, the Umayyads were toppled and replaced by the Iraq-based Abbasid Caliphate.\n\nAbbasid period\nThe Abbasids generally exhibited little interest in Jerusalem, though the historian Shelomo Dov Goitein notes they \"paid special tribute\" to the city during the early part of their rule, and Grabar asserts that the early Abbasids' work on the mosque suggests \"a major attempt to assert Abbasid sponsorship of holy places\". Nevertheless, in contrast to the Umayyad period, maintenance of the al-Aqsa Mosque during Abbasid rule often came at the initiative of the local Muslim community, rather than from the caliph. The second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur (r. 754–775), visited Jerusalem in 758, on his return from the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. He found the structures on the Haram in ruins from the 746 earthquake, including the al-Aqsa Mosque. According to the tradition cited by Mujir al-Din, the caliph was beseeched by the city's Muslim residents to fund the buildings' restoration. In response, he had the gold and silver plaques covering the mosque's doors converted into dinars and dirhams to finance the reconstruction.\nA second earthquake damaged most of al-Mansur's repairs, except for the southern portion near the mihrab (prayer niche indicating the qibla). In 780, his successor, al-Mahdi, ordered its reconstruction, mandating that his provincial governors and other commanders each contribute the cost of a colonnade. Al-Mahdi's renovation is the first known to have written records describing it. The Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi, writing in 985, provided the following description:\n\nThis mosque is even more beautiful than that of Damascus ... the edifice [after al-Mahdi's reconstruction] rose firmer and more substantial than ever it had been in former times. The more ancient portion remained, even like a beauty spot, in the midst of the new ... the Aqsa mosque has twenty-six doors ... The centre of the Main-building is covered by a mighty roof, high pitched and gable-wise, over which rises a magnificent dome.\nAl-Muqaddasi further noted that the mosque consisted of fifteen aisles aligned perpendicularly to the qibla and possessed an elaborately decorated porch with the names of the Abbasid caliphs inscribed on its gates. According to Hamilton, al-Muqaddasi's description of the Abbasid-era mosque is corroborated by his archaeological findings in 1938–1942, which showed the Abbasid construction retained some parts of the older structure and had a broad central aisle topped by a dome. The mosque described by al-Muqaddasi opened to the north, toward the Dome of the Rock, and, unusually according to Grabar, to the east.\nOther than al-Mansur and al-Mahdi, no other Abbasid caliphs visited Jerusalem or commissioned work on the al-Aqsa Mosque, though Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) ordered significant work elsewhere on the Haram. He also contributed a bronze portal to the mosque's interior, and the geographer Nasir Khusraw noted during his 1047 visit that al-Ma'mun's name was inscribed on it. Abd Allah ibn Tahir, the Abbasid governor of the eastern province of Khurasan (r. 828–844), is credited by al-Muqaddasi for building a colonnade on marble pillars in front of the fifteen doors on the mosque's front (north) side.\n\nFatimid period\nIn 970, the Egypt-based Fatimid Caliphate conquered Palestine from the Ikhshidids, nominal allegiants of the Abbasids. Unlike the Abbasids and the Muslim inhabitants of Jerusalem, who were Sunnis, the Fatimids followed Shia Islam in its Isma'ili form. In 1033, another earthquake severely damaged the mosque. The Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021–1036) had the mosque reconstructed between 1034 and 1036, though work was not completed until 1065, during the reign of Caliph al-Mustansir (r. 1036–1094).\nThe new mosque was considerably smaller, reduced from fifteen aisles to seven, probably a reflection of the local population's significant decline by this time. Excluding the two aisles on each side of the central nave, each aisle was made up of eleven arches running perpendicular to the qibla. The central nave was twice the breadth of the other aisles and had a gabled roof with a dome. The mosque likely lacked the side doors of its predecessor.\nA prominent and distinctive feature of the new construction was the rich mosaic program endowed to the drum of the dome, the pendentives leading to the dome, and the arch in front of the mihrab. These three adjoining areas covered by the mosaics are collectively referred to as the \"triumphal arch\" by Grabar or the \"maqsura\" by Pruitt. Mosaic designs were rare in Islamic architecture in the post-Umayyad era and al-Zahir's mosaics were a revival of this Umayyad architectural practice, including Abd al-Malik's mosaics in the Dome of the Rock, but on a larger scale. The drum mosaic depicts a luxurious garden inspired by the Umayyad or Classical style. The four pendentives are gold and characterized by indented roundels with alternating gold and silver planes and patterns of peacock's eyes, eight-pointed stars, and palm fronds. On the arch are large depictions of vegetation emanating from small vases.\n\nAtop the mihrab arch is a lengthy inscription in gold directly linking the al-Aqsa Mosque with Muhammad's Night Journey (the isra and mi'raj) from the \"masjid al-haram\" to the \"masjid al-aqsa\". It marked the first instance of this Quranic verse being inscribed in Jerusalem, leading Grabar to hypothesize that it was an official move by the Fatimids to magnify the site's sacred character. The inscription credits al-Zahir for renovating the mosque and two otherwise unknown figures, Abu al-Wasim and a sharif, al-Hasan al-Husayni, for supervising the work.\nNasir Khusraw described the mosque during his 1047 visit. He deemed it \"very large\", measuring 420 by 150 cubits on its western side. The distance between each \"sculptured\" marble column, 280 in number, was six cubits. The columns were supported by stone arches and lead joints. He noted the following features:\n\n ... the mosque is everywhere flagged with coloured marble ... The Maksurah [or space railed off for the officials] is facing the centre of the south wall [of the Mosque and Haram Area], and is of such size as to contain sixteen columns. Above rises a mighty dome that is ornamented with enamel work.\nAl-Zahir's substantial investment in the Haram, including the al-Aqsa Mosque, amid the political instability in the capital Cairo, rebellions by Bedouin tribes, especially the Jarrahids of Palestine, and plagues, indicate the caliph's \"commitment to Jerusalem\", in Pruitt's words. Although the city had experienced decreases in its population in the preceding decades, the Fatimids attempted to build up the magnificence and symbolism of the mosque, and the Haram in general, for their own religious and political reasons. The present-day mosque largely retains al-Zahir's plan.\nFatimid investment in Jerusalem ground to a halt toward the end of the 11th century as their rule became further destabilized. In 1071, a Turkish mercenary, Atsiz, was invited by the city's Fatimid governor to rein in the Bedouin, but he turned on the Fatimids, besieging and capturing Jerusalem that year. A few years later, the inhabitants revolted against him, and were slaughtered by Atsiz, including those who had taken shelter in the al-Aqsa Mosque. He was killed by the Turkish Seljuks in 1078, establishing Seljuk rule over the city, which lasted until the Fatimids regained control in 1098.\n\nCrusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods\nJerusalem was captured by the Crusaders in 1099, during the First Crusade. They named the mosque Templum Solomonis (Solomon's Temple), distinguishing it from the Dome of the Rock, which they named Templum Domini (Temple of God). While the Dome of the Rock was turned into a Christian church under the care of the Augustinians, the al-Aqsa Mosque was used as a royal palace and also as a stable for horses. In 1119, the Crusader king accommodated the headquarters of the Knights Templar next to his palace within the building. During this period, the mosque underwent some structural changes, including the expansion of its northern porch, and the addition of an apse and a dividing wall. A new cloister and church were also built at the site, along with various other structures. The Templars constructed vaulted western and eastern annexes to the building; the western currently serves as the women's mosque and the eastern as the Islamic Museum.\nAfter the Ayyubids under the leadership of Saladin reconquered Jerusalem following the siege of 1187, several repairs and renovations were undertaken at al-Aqsa Mosque. In order to prepare the mosque for Friday prayers, within a week of his capture of Jerusalem Saladin had the toilets and grain stores installed by the Crusaders at al-Aqsa removed, the floors covered with precious carpets, and its interior scented with rosewater and incense. Saladin's predecessor—the Zengid sultan Nur al-Din—had commissioned the construction of a new minbar or \"pulpit\" made of ivory and wood in 1168–69, but it was completed after his death; Nur ad-Din's minbar was added to the mosque in November 1187 by Saladin. The Ayyubid sultan of Damascus, al-Mu'azzam, built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates in 1218. In 1345, the Mamluk sultan al-Kamil Sha'ban added two naves and two gates to the mosque's eastern side.\n\nOttoman/modern period\nAfter the Ottomans assumed power in 1517, they did not undertake any major renovations or repairs to the mosque. They made architectural contributions elsewhere on the Haram, including building the Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527) and three free-standing domes—the most notable being the Dome of the Prophet built in 1538, and restoring the Pool of Raranj. These constructions were commissioned by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem, rather than the sultans, whose contributions were limited to additions to the existing minarets.\nIn 1816, the mosque was restored by Sulayman Pasha al-Adil, the Acre-based governor of Sidon, after having been in a dilapidated state.\nThe first renovation in the 20th century occurred in 1922, when the Supreme Muslim Council under Amin al-Husayni (the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) commissioned Turkish architect Ahmet Kemalettin Bey to restore al-Aqsa Mosque and the monuments in its precincts. The council also commissioned British architects, Egyptian engineering experts and local officials to contribute to and oversee the repairs and additions which were carried out in 1924–25 by Kemalettin. The renovations included reinforcing the mosque's ancient Umayyad foundations, rectifying the interior columns, replacing the beams, erecting a scaffolding, conserving the arches and drum of the main dome's interior, rebuilding the southern wall, and replacing timber in the central nave with a slab of concrete. The renovations also revealed Fatimid-era mosaics and inscriptions on the interior arches that had been covered with plasterwork. The arches were decorated with gold and green-tinted gypsum and their timber tie beams were replaced with brass. A quarter of the stained glass windows also were carefully renewed so as to preserve their original Abbasid and Fatimid designs.\nSevere damage was caused by the 1837 and 1927 earthquakes. The damage from the 1927 earthquake and a small tremor in the summer of 1937 caused the roof of the mosque to collapse. Repairs were undertaken in 1938 and 1942. The upper part of the north wall of the mosque was reconstructed and the whole interior of the roofing was refaced. Other repairs included the partial reconstruction of the jambs and lintels of the central doors, the refacing of the front of five bays of the porch, and the demolition of the vaulted buildings that formerly adjoined the east side of the mosque. Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini donated Carrara marble columns in the late 1930s.\nOn 20 July 1951, King Abdullah I was shot three times by a Palestinian gunman as he entered the mosque, killing him. His grandson Prince Hussein, was at his side and was also hit, though a medal he was wearing on his chest deflected the bullet.\n\nThe site fell under Israeli control on 7 June 1967, during the Six Day War.\nOn 21 August 1969, a fire was started by a visitor from Australia named Denis Michael Rohan, an evangelical Christian who hoped that by burning down al-Aqsa Mosque he would hasten the Second Coming of Jesus. In response to the incident, a summit of Islamic countries was held in Rabat that same year, hosted by Faisal of Saudi Arabia, the then king of Saudi Arabia. The al-Aqsa fire is regarded as one of the catalysts for the formation of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC, now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) in 1972.\nFollowing the fire, the dome was reconstructed in concrete and covered with anodized aluminium, instead of the original ribbed lead enamel work sheeting. In 1983, the aluminium outer covering was replaced with lead to match the original design by az-Zahir.\nIn the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both members of the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted to blow up the al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion believed that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque.\nOn 5 November 2014, Israeli police entered Al-Aqsa for the first time since capturing Jerusalem in 1967, said Sheikh Azzam Al-Khatib, director of the Islamic Waqf. Previous media reports of 'storming Al-Aqsa' referred to the Haram al-Sharif compound rather than the Al-Aqsa mosque itself.\n\nArchitecture\nThe rectangular al-Aqsa Mosque and its precincts cover 14.4 hectares (36 acres), although the mosque itself is about 1.1 acres (0.46 ha) in area and can hold up to 5,000 worshippers. It is 83 m (272 ft) long, 56 m (184 ft) wide. Unlike the Dome of the Rock, which reflects classical Byzantine architecture, the Aqsa Mosque is characteristic of early Islamic architecture.\n\nDome\nNothing remains of the original dome built by Abd al-Malik. The present-day dome mimicks that of az-Zahir, which consisted of wood plated with lead enamelwork, but which was destroyed by fire in 1969. Today it is made of concrete with lead sheeting.\nAl-Aqsa's dome is one of the few domes to be built in front of the mihrab during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, the others being the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus (715) and the Great Mosque of Sousse (850). The interior of the dome is painted with 14th-century-era decorations. During the 1969 burning, the paintings were assumed to be irreparably lost, but were completely reconstructed using the trateggio technique, a method that uses fine vertical lines to distinguish reconstructed areas from original ones.\n\nFacade and porch\nThe facade of the mosque was built in 1065 CE on the instructions of the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir Billah. It was crowned with a balustrade consisting of arcades and small columns. The Crusaders damaged the facade, but it was restored and renovated by the Ayyubids. One addition was the covering of the facade with tiles. The second-hand material of the facade's arches includes sculpted, ornamental material taken from Crusader structures in Jerusalem. The facade consists of fourteen stone arches, most of which are of a Romanesque style. The outer arches added by the Mamluks follow the same general design. The entrance to the mosque is through the facade's central arch.\nThe porch is located at the top of the facade. The central bays of the porch were built by the Knights Templar during the First Crusade, but Saladin's nephew al-Mu'azzam Isa ordered the construction of the porch itself in 1217.\n\nInterior\nThe al-Aqsa Mosque has seven aisles of hypostyle naves with several additional small halls to the west and east of the southern section of the building. There are 121 stained glass windows in the mosque from the Abbasid and Fatimid eras. About a fourth of them were restored in 1924. The spandrels of the arch opposite the main entrance include a mosaic decoration and inscription dating back to Fatimid period.\n\nThe mosque's interior is supported by 45 columns, 33 of which are white marble and 12 of stone. The column rows of the central aisles are heavy and stunted. The remaining four rows are better proportioned. The capitals of the columns are of four different kinds: those in the central aisle are heavy and primitively designed, while those under the dome are of the Corinthian order, and made from Italian white marble. The capitals in the eastern aisle are of a heavy basket-shaped design and those east and west of the dome are also basket-shaped, but smaller and better proportioned. The columns and piers are connected by an architectural rave, which consists of beams of roughly squared timber enclosed in a wooden casing.\nA great portion of the mosque is covered with whitewash, but the drum of the dome and the walls immediately beneath it are decorated with mosaics and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927. The ceiling of the mosque was painted with funding by King Farouk of Egypt.\n\nMinbar\nThe minbar of the mosque was built by a craftsman named Akhtarini from Aleppo on the orders of the Zengid sultan Nur ad-Din. It was intended to be a gift for the mosque when Nur ad-Din would capture Jerusalem from the Crusaders and took six years to build (1168–74). Nur ad-Din died and the Crusaders still controlled Jerusalem, but in 1187, Saladin captured the city and the minbar was installed. The structure was made of ivory and carefully crafted wood. Arabic calligraphy, geometrical and floral designs were inscribed in the woodwork.\nAfter its destruction by Rohan in 1969, it was replaced by a much simpler minbar. In January 2007, Adnan al-Husayni—head of the Islamic waqf in charge of al-Aqsa—stated that a new minbar would be installed; it was installed in February 2007. The design of the new minbar was drawn by Jamil Badran based on an exact replica of the Saladin Minbar and was finished by Badran within a period of five years. The minbar itself was built in Jordan over a period of four years and the craftsmen used \"ancient woodworking methods, joining the pieces with pegs instead of nails, but employed computer images to design the pulpit [minbar].\"\n\nCurrent situation\nAdministration\nThe administrative body responsible for the whole Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is known as \"the Jerusalem Waqf\", an organ of the Jordanian government.\nThe Jerusalem Waqf is responsible for administrative matters in the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Religious authority on the site, on the other hand, is the responsibility of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, appointed by the government of the State of Palestine.\nAfter the 1969 arson attack, the waqf employed architects, technicians and craftsmen in a committee that carry out regular maintenance operations. The Islamic Movement in Israel and the waqf have attempted to increase Muslim control of the Temple Mount as a way of countering Israeli policies and the escalating presence of Israeli security forces around the site since the Second Intifada. Some activities included refurbishing abandoned structures and renovating.\nOwnership of the al-Aqsa Mosque is a contentious issue in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. During the negotiations at the 2000 Camp David Summit, Palestinians demanded complete ownership of the mosque and other Islamic holy sites in East Jerusalem.\n\nAccess\nMuslims who are residents of Israel or visiting the country and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally allowed to enter the Temple Mount and pray at al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions. Due to security measures, the Israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex; the restrictions vary from time to time. At times, restrictions have prevented all men under 45, unmarried men under 50 and women under 45 from entering. Sometimes the restrictions are enforced on the occasion of Friday prayers, other times they are over an extended period of time. Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank. The Israeli government states that the restrictions are in place for security reasons.\nUntil 2000, non-Muslim visitors could enter the Aqsa Mosque by getting a ticket from the Waqf. That procedure ended when the Second Intifada began. Over two decades later, the Waqf still hopes negotiations between Israel and Jordan may result in allowing visitors to enter once again.\n\nExcavations\nSeveral excavations outside the Temple Mount took place following the 1967 War. In 1970, Israeli authorities commenced intensive excavations outside the walls next to the mosque on the southern and western sides. Palestinians believed that tunnels were being dug under the Aqsa Mosque in order to undermine its foundations, which was denied by Israelis, who claimed that the closest excavation to the mosque was some 70 meters (230 ft) to its south. The Archaeological Department of the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs dug a tunnel near the western portion of the mosque in 1984. According to UNESCO's special envoy to Jerusalem Oleg Grabar, buildings and structures on the Temple Mount are deteriorating due mostly to disputes between the Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian governments over who is actually responsible for the site.\nIn February 2007, the department started to excavate a site for archaeological remains in a location where the government wanted to rebuild a collapsed pedestrian bridge leading to the Mughrabi Gate, the only entrance for non-Muslims into the Temple Mount complex. This site was 60 meters (200 ft) away from the mosque. The excavations provoked anger throughout the Islamic world, and Israel was accused of trying to destroy the foundation of the mosque. Ismail Haniyeh—then Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority and Hamas leader—called on Palestinians to unite to protest the excavations, while Fatah said they would end their ceasefire with Israel. Israel denied all charges against them, calling them \"ludicrous\".\n\nConflicts\nIn April 2021, during both Passover and Ramadan, the site was a focus of tension between Israeli settlers and Palestinians. Jewish settlers broke an agreement between Israel and Jordan and performed prayers and read from the Torah inside the compound, an area normally off limits to non-Muslims. On 14 April, Israeli police entered the area and forcibly cut wires to speakers in minarets around the mosque, silencing the call to prayer, claiming the sound was interfering with an event by the Israeli president at the Western Wall. On 16 April, seventy thousand Muslims prayed in the compound around the mosque, the largest gathering since the beginning of the COVID pandemic; police barred most from entering the structure itself. In May 2021, hundreds of Palestinians were injured following clashes in the compound after reports of Israel's intention to proceed to evict Palestinians from land claimed by Israeli settlers.\nOn 15 April 2022, Israeli forces entered the Temple Mount and used tear gas shells and sound bombs to disperse Palestinians who, they said, were throwing stones at policemen. Some Palestinians barricaded themselves inside the Al-Aqsa mosque, where they were detained by Israeli police. Over 150 people ended up injured and 400 arrested.\nOn April 5, 2023, Israeli police raided the temple, saying \"agitators\" who had thrown stones and fired fireworks at the police, had barricaded themselves and worshippers inside. Following the incident, militants fired rockets from Gaza into southern Israel.\nOn 22 April 2024 Israeli police arrested 13 for incitement to violence after they were caught in the act of smuggling goats onto the site for ritual sacrifice, 3 had been arrested in 2023 for trying to smuggle lambs and goats onto the site.\n\nSee also\nIslam in Israel\nList of mosques in Israel\nList of the oldest mosques in the world\nIslam in the Palestinian territories\nAl-Juʽranah in Saudi Arabia, alternative location for Quranic \"al-Aqsa mosque\"\nPalestinian nationalism – Movement for self-determination and sovereignty of Palestine\nReligious significance of the Syrian region – Region east of the Mediterranean SeaPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nAllan, J.

      "summary": "The Aqsa Mosque, also known as the Qibli Mosque or Qibli Chapel, is the main congregational mosque or prayer hall in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem. In some sources the building is also named al-Masjid al-Aqṣā, but this name primarily applies to the whole compound in which the building sits, which is itself also known as \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\". The wider compound is known as Al-Aqsa or Al-Aqsa mosque compound, also known as al-Ḥaram al-Sharīf.\nAccording to Islamic tradition, a small prayer hall (musalla), what would later become the Al-Aqsa Mosque, was built by Umar, the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate. In the reign of the caliph Mu'awiyah I of the Umayyad Caliphate (founded in AD 661), a quadrangular mosque for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers is recorded somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif. \nThe present-day mosque, located on the south wall of the compound, was originally built by the fifth Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) or his successor al-Walid I (r. 705–715) (or both) as a congregational mosque on the same axis as the Dome of the Rock, a commemorative Islamic monument. After being destroyed in an earthquake in 746, the mosque was rebuilt in 758 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. It was further expanded upon in 780 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi, after which it consisted of fifteen aisles and a central dome. However, it was again destroyed during the 1033 Jordan Rift Valley earthquake. The mosque was rebuilt by the Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021–1036), who reduced it to seven aisles but adorned its interior with an elaborate central archway covered in vegetal mosaics; the current structure preserves the 11th-century outline.\nDuring the periodic renovations undertaken, the ruling Islamic dynasties constructed additions to the mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, façade, minarets, and minbar and interior structure. Upon its capture by the Crusaders in 1099, the mosque was used as a palace; it was also the headquarters of the religious order of the Knights Templar. After the area was conquered by Saladin in 1187, the structure's function as a mosque was restored. More renovations, repairs, and expansion projects were undertaken in later centuries by the Ayyubids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council of British Palestine, and during the Jordanian rule of the West Bank. Since the beginning of the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the mosque has remained under the independent administration of the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.",

      "content": "ٱلْمَسْجِدُ ٱلْاَقْصَىٰ احد اكبر مساجد العالم واحد المساجد الثلاثه التي يشد المسلمون الرحال اليها، كما قال نبي الاسلام محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم؛ وهو ايضًا اول القبلتين في الاسلام. يقع داخل البلده القديمه بالقدس في فلسطين. وهو كامل المنطقه المحاطه بالسور واسم لكل ما هو داخل سور المسجد الاقصى الواقع في اقصى الزاويه الجنوبيه الشرقيه من البلده القديمه المسوره.\nتبلغ مساحته قرابه 144000 متر مربع، ويشمل قبه الصخره والمسجد القِبْلي والمصلى المرواني ومصلى باب الرحمه، وعده معالم اخرى يصل عددها الى 200 معلمًا. ويقع المسجد الاقصى فوق هضبه صغيره تُسمى «هضبه موريا»، وتعد الصخره اعلى نقطه فيه، وتقع في قلبه.\nذُكر المسجد الاقصى في القران: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي اَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ اِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْاَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ايَاتِنَا اِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾ [الاسراء:1] (1).\nيُقدّس اليهود ايضًا المكان نفسه، ويطلقون على ساحات المسجد الاقصى اسمَ «جبل الهيكل» نسبه الى هيكل النبي سليمان، وتُحاول العديد من المنظمات اليهوديه التذرع بهذه الحجه لبناء الهيكل حسب مُعتقدها.\n\nاصل التسميه\nللمسجد الاقصى عده اسماء، اهمّها ثلاثه:\n\nالمسجد الاقصى: وكلمه «الاقصى» تعني الابعد، وسُمِّيَ الاقصَى لبعد ما بينه وبين المسجد الحرام، وكان ابعد مسجد عن اهل مكه في الارض يعظَّم بالزياره. والذي سمّاه بهذا الاسم وفقًا للعقيده الاسلاميه الله في القران، وذلك في الايه: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي اَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ اِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْاَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ايَاتِنَا اِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾ [الاسراء:1] (1)، كُتبت فيه الالفُ الاخيره ممدودهً الاقصا، وهو اسم تفضيل معناه الابعد، ثم صار يُقصد به الوصف لا التفضيل، وفي الاسم اعلال اذ اصلها الاقصَي بالياء المنقوطه، ثم اصبحت الياء الفاً لان ما قبلها حرف الصاد مفتوح، واصل الف الاقصى واو او ياء، اما قصِيَ يقصو، او قصا يقصو.\nالبيت المُقَدَّس: وكلمه «المقدّس» تعني المبارك والمطهّر، وقد ذكر علماءُ المسلمين وشعراؤهم هذا الاسم كثيرًا، كما قال الامام ابن حجر العسقلاني:\n\nبيت المَقْدِس: وهو الاسم الذي كان متعارفًا عليه قبل ان يُطلق عليه اسم «المسجد الاقصى» في القران الكريم، وهذا الاسم هو المستَخدَم في معظم احاديث النبي محمد، مثل ما قاله يوم الاسراء والمعراج: «ثم دخلت انا وجبريل عليه السلام بيت المقدس فصلى كل واحد منا ركعتين».\n\nاعتقادات خاطئه عن حدوده بسبب الاحتلال\nيعتقد الكثيرون ان المسجد الاقصى هو فقط المصلى المبني جنوبي قبه الصخره (المصلى القبلي)، وهو الذي تقام فيه الصلوات الخمس الان للرجال، وهذا الاعتقاد نتيجه محاولات الاحتلال الاسرائيلي الصهيوني السيطره على اجزاء من الاقصى او تدميره، والصحيح ان المسجد الاقصى هو اسم لجميع المسجد وهو كل ما هو داخل سور المسجد ويشمل الساحات الواسعه، والجامع القبلي وقبه الصخره والمصلى المرواني ومصلى باب الرحمه والاروقه والقباب والمصاطب واسبله الماء والحدائق وتحت ارض المسجد وفوقه وغيرها من المعالم، وعلى اسواره الماذن، والمسجد كله غير مسقّف سوى بناء قبه الصخره والمصلى القبلي الجامع والمصلى المرواني. وهذا ما اتفق عليه العلماء والمؤرخون، وعليه تكون مضاعفه ثواب الصلاه في اي جزء مما دار عليه السور، وتبلغ مساحته تقريباً 144000 متراً مربعاً.\n\nتاريخ المسجد الاقصى\nاول بنائه\nلا يُعرف بدقه متى بُني المسجد الاقصى لاول مره، ولكن ورد في احاديث النبي محمد بان بناءه كان بعد بناء الكعبه باربعين عامًا، فعن ابي ذر انه قال: «قلت: يا رسول الله! اي مسجد وضع في الارض اول؟ قال: المسجد الحرام. قلت: ثم اي؟ قال: المسجد الاقصى. قلت: كم بينهما؟ قال: اربعون سنه». وقد اختلف المؤرخون في مساله الباني الاول للمسجد الاقصى على عده اقوال: انهم الملائكه، او النبي ادم ابو البشر، او ابنه شيث، او سام بن نوح، او النبي ابراهيم، ويرجع الاختلاف في ذلك الى الاختلاف في الباني الاول للكعبه، وقد رجّح الباحث عبد الله معروف بان ادم هو من بنى المسجد الاقصى البناء الاول، لروايه عن ابن عباس، ولترجيح ان يكون ادم هو الباني للكعبه، كما رجّحه الامام ابن حجر العسقلاني في كتابه فتح الباري. ويُرجّح عبد الله معروف ان يكون البناء الاول للمسجد الاقصى قد اقتصر على وضع حدوده وتحديد مساحته التي تتراوح ما بين 142 و144 دونماً.\n\nعهد اليبوسيين وبني اسرائيل\nاما من بعد عهد ادم، فقد انقطعت اخبار المسجد لانعدام التاريخ في تلك الفتره، الى ان سُجلت معلومات تاريخيه عن اول مجموعه من البشر قدمت الى مدينه القدس وسكنتها، وهم اليبوسيون (3000 - 1550 ق.م) قبيله كنعانيه، وهم الذين بنوا مدينه القدس واسموها \"اور شليم (مدينه السلام)، حتى ان بقايا الاثار اليبوسيه ما تزال باقيه في سور المسجد الاقصى بحسب راي بعض الباحثين. وفي تلك الفتره، هاجر النبي ابراهيم الى مدينه القدس، وعمّر المسجد وصلّى فيه، وكذلك ابنه اسحق وحفيده يعقوب من بعده.\nوبعد ذلك ال امر مدينه القدس والمسجد الاقصى الى الفراعنه (1550 - 1000 ق.م)، ثم استولى عليها لاحقًا «القوم العمالقه»، ثم فتح المدينه النبي داود ومعه بنو اسرائيل عام 995 ق.م، فَوُسْع المدينه وعمّر المسجد الاقصى. ثم استلم الحكم ابنه سليمان، فعمّر المسجد وجدّده مره اخرى، ويروي النبي محمد ذلك فيقول: «لِمَا فرغ سُليمانُ بنُ داودَ عليهما اَلسَّلَام من بناءِ بيتِ المقدسِ سال اللهَ عَزَّ وَجِلَ ثلاثًا ان يُؤتيَه حُكمًا يُصادِفُ حُكمَه ومُلكًا لا ينبغي لاحدٍ من بعدِه وَاَنَّهُ لا ياتي هذا المسجدَ احدٌ لا يُريدُ اِلَّا اَلصَّلَاه فيه الَّا خرج من ذنوبِه كيومِ ولدَتْه اُمّه» فقال النبي محمد: «اما اثنتيْن فقد اُعْطِيهما وارجو ان يكونَ قد اُعْطِي اَلثَّالِثَه»، وهذا البناء لسليمان هو الذي يقول اليهود بنسبته اليهم، ويطلقون عليه اسم «هيكل سليمان». وبوفاه النبي سليمان، انتهى حكم بني اسرائيل الذي دام 80 عامًا.\n\nعهد الهياكل\nبعد وفاه سليمان، انقسمت دوله بني اسرائيل الى «مملكه اسرائيل» في الشمال، و«مملكه يهوذا» في الجنوب ومعها القدس، وما لبثت ان هاجمها البابليون واحرقوا الهيكل، وسبوا اليهود الى بابل فيما عُرْف بالسبي البابلي. بعد ذلك هزم الفرس البابليين، وسمح الملك الفارسي قورش الكبير عام 538 ق.م لمن اراد من اسرى اليهود في بابل بالعوده الى القدس واعاده بناء الهيكل المهدم، فعاد عدد من اليهود الى القدس وشرعوا في بناء الهيكل الثاني، وانتهوا من العمل به سنه 516 ق.م، في عهد الملك الفارسي دارا الاول، وعُرف فيما بعد بمعبد حيرود تيمنًا بملك اليهود حيرود الكبير الذي قام بتوسيعه.\n\nعهد الرومان والبيزنطيين\nاحتلّ الاغريق اراضي فلسطين، وخضعت للاسكندر المقدوني (حوالي عام 332 ق.م)، ثم لخلفائه البطالمه، ثم للسلوقيين، ولم تلبث المدينه حتى خضعت لحكم الامبراطوريه الرومانيه، وكان من اوائل الحكام وابرزهم الذين عينهم الرومان لحكم القدس الحاكم هيرودس (حوالي عام 37 ق.م)، وقد قام بتجديد بناء البيت المقدس (حوالي عام 20 ق.م)، كما اقام قلعه عظيمه بباب الخليل (يطلق عليها اليهود الان اسم «قلعه داود»). وفي تلك الفتره تذكر المصادر الاسلاميه بعثه النبي عيسى بن مريم، وزكريا وابنه يحيى بن زكريا الى بني اسرائيل في القدس، حيث كان يحيى يعِظُهم داخل المسجد الاقصى، كما يفيد الحديث النبوي: «فجمع يحيى بن زكريا بني اسرائيل في بيت المقدس حتى امتلا المسجد فقعد على الشرف فحمد الله واثنى عليه ثم قال ان الله امرني بخمس كلمات ان اعمل بهن وامركم ان تعملوا بهن..»، كما يذكر الانجيل الذي بين ايدي النصارى اليوم ان عيسى بن مريم انكر على بني اسرائيل انحرافهم عن عباده الله تعالى داخل المسجد الاقصى، وتحويلهم اياه الى مكان للبيع والشراء.\nوبعد النبي عيسى بن مريم بحوالي 300 عام، انقسمت الامبراطوريه الرومانيه الى الامبراطوريه الرومانيه الغربيه في الغرب، والامبراطوريه البيزنطيه في الشرق، وبقيت الامبراطوريه البيزنطيه هي المُسيطره على القدس، فاصبحت القدس مدينه نصرانيه، وبنوا فيها كنيسه القيامه. اما المسجد الاقصى فبقي متروكًا كما هو دون بناء. وفي عام 614 احتل الفرس مدينه القدس بمعاونه اليهود، وذلك بعد حرب طويله ضد البيزنطيين الروم، وقد وقع ذلك في الفتره التي بُعث فيها النبي محمد في مكه، اذ يذكر القران قصه الحروب في سوره الروم: ﴿غُلِبَتِ الرُّومُ ۝٢ فِي اَدْنَى الْاَرْضِ وَهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ غَلَبِهِمْ سَيَغْلِبُونَ ۝٣﴾ [الروم:2–3].(2) وما لبث ان عاد البيزنطيون الروم الى الحكم عام 624، وفي تلك الفتره اصبحت ارض المسجد الاقصى مكبًا للنّفايات، وذلك انتقامًا من اليهود، اذ كانت الصخره المُشرفه قبله لهم.\n\nعهد النبي محمد\nكانت هناك اهميّه خاصه للمسجد الاقصى في عهد النبي محمد، اذ كان القبله الاولى للمسلمين بعد هجره النبي محمد الى المدينه المنوره عام 1 هـ الموافق 622م، فقد كان المسلمون يتوجّهون الى المسجد الاقصى في صلواتهم، ومكثوا على ذلك مده 16 شهرًا تقريبًا. فقد روى البراء بن عازب انه قال: «لما قَدِمَ النَّبيُ صلى الله عليه وسلم المدينهَ صلّى نَحوَ بيتِ المقدسِ سِتهَ عَشرَ شهرًا او سبعهَ عَشرَ شهرًا، وكان يُحبُ انْ يُوَجِّهِ الى الكَعبهِ، فانزل اللّه  ﴿قَدْ نَرَى تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي السَّمَاءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَهً تَرْضَاهَا فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ وَاِنَّ الَّذِينَ اُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ اَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ ۝١٤٤﴾ [البقره:144] (3).».\nوكان المسجد الاقصى وجهه النبي محمد في الرحله المعجزه المعروفه باسم الاسراء والمعراج، وذلك ليله 27 رجب بعد البعثه بعشر سنين (3 ق هـ)، اذ يؤمن المسلمون ان النبيَّ محمدًا خرج من المسجد الحرام بصحبه المَلَك جبريل راكبًا دابّه البراق، فنزل في المسجد الاقصى وربط البُراق بحلقه باب المسجد عند حائط البراق، وصلّى بجميع الانبياء امامًا، ثم عُرج به من الصخره المشرّفه الى فوق سبع سماوات مارًا بالانبياء: ادم ويحيى بن زكريا وعيسى بن مريم ويوسف وادريس وهارون وموسى وابراهيم.\n\nالفتح الاسلامي\nعندما تولّى الخليفه ابو بكر الصديق خلافه المسلمين خلفاً للنبي محمد، قام بتسيير جيش اسامه بن زيد لفتح بلاد الشام عامّه ونشر الدعوه الاسلاميه فيها، وقد كان النبي محمد قد جهّز جيش اسامه قبل وفاته، وما لبث ان تُوفي ابو بكر الصديق، فتولّى عمر بن الخطاب الخلافه، فكان اوّل ما فعله ان ولّى ابا عبيده بن الجراح قياده الجيش الفاتح لبلاد الشام بدلاً من خالد بن الوليد، فوصل ابو عبيده بن الجراح الى مدينه القدس (وكانت تُسمى «ايلياء»)، فاستعصت عليهم ولم يتمكنوا من فتحها لمناعه اسوارها، حيث اعتصم اهلها داخل الاسوار، فحاصرهم حتى تعبوا وارسلوا يطلبون الصلحَ وتسليم المدينه بلا قتال، واشترطوا ان ياتي خليفه المسلمين بنفسه الى القدس ليتسلّم مفاتيحها منهم، فخرج عمر بن الخطاب من المدينه المنوره حتى وصل القدس، وذلك عام 15 هـ الموافق 636م، واعطى اهلها الامن وكتب لهم العهده العمريه. وقد صحبه البطريرك «صفرونيوس» فزار كنيسه القيامه، ومن ثم اوصله الى المسجد الاقصى، فلمّا دخله قال: «الله اكبر، هذا المسجد الذي وصفه لنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم»، وكان في تلك الايام هضبه خاليه في قلبها الصخره المشرفه، ثم امر الخليفه عمر بن الخطاب ببناء المصلّى الرئيسي الذي سيكون مكان الصلاه الرئيسي في المسجد الاقصى، وهو موقع «الجامع القبلي» اليوم، ويقع في الجنوب في جهه القبله، وكان المسجد في عهده خشبيًّا يتّسع لحوالي 1000 شخص، وبقي على حاله الى زمن الخليفه الاموي معاويه بن ابي سفيان.\n\nالعهد الاموي\nبعد قيام الدوله الامويه في عام 41 هـ الموافق 661 على يد معاويه بن ابي سفيان، قام بتجديد بناء المسجد القبلي داخل المسجد الاقصى الذي بناه عمر بن الخطاب، فجعل من الحجر بدلاً من الخشب، ووسّعه ليسع 3000 مصلٍ. وقد ذكر بعض المؤرخين المسلمين في مذكراتهم مثل مجير الدين والمقدسي والسيوطي ان اوسع حركه تعمير للمسجد تمت في عهد الخليفه عبد الملك بن مروان منذ عام 65 هـ الموافق 685 جنبا الى جنب مع قبه الصخره، وتواصلت في عهد ابنه الوليد بن عبد الملك حتى عام 96 هـ الموافق 715. حيث بدا البناء الاموي للمسجد الاقصى ببناء قبه الصخره وهي قبه ذهبيه فوق الصخره المشرفه الواقعه في قلب الاقصى (في منتصف المسجد اقرب الى الغرب قليلا)، والتي تمثل اعلى نقطه في جبل البيت المقدس، ويعتقد ان معراج النبي محمد الى السماء تم منها، لتكون قبه للمسجد كاملاً. وقبل الشروع ببنائها، اقيمت بجانبها قبه صغيره في منتصف المسجد الاقصى تماماً، عُرفت بـ «قبه السلسله»، لتكون مقراً للمشرفين على البناء للاقصى، وخزانه لجمع الاموال اللازمه لذلك، وقيل لتكون نموذجاً لقبه الصخره.\n\nالزلزال واعاده البناء\nفي عام 746م، تعرض المسجد الاقصى الى زلزال ادى الى تدميره، وبعد اربع سنوات اطاح السفاح بالخلافه الامويه، وانشا الخلافه العباسيه عام 750م. وبعد اربع سنوات توفي السفاح بعد ان عهد بالخلافه لاخيه ابو جعفر المنصور، وقد اعلن المنصور نيته لاصلاح المسجد، وقال انه لويحات الذهب والفضه التي غطت بوابات المسجد يجب ازالتها وتحولت الى دينار ودرهم لتمويل اعاده الاعمار التي انتهت في عام 771م. وفي عام 774م، ضرب زلزال ثاني المسجد ادى الى تدمير معظم اصلاحات المنصور، باستثناء تلك التي في الجزء الجنوبي من المسجد. وفي عام 780م، اعيد بناء المسجد في عهد الخليفه محمد المهدي الذي امر ببنائه فانقص من طوله وزيد في عرضه وفي عام 985، اشار الجغرافي المقدسي ان المسجد الذي تم تجديده كان يضم «خمسه عشر رواق وخمسه عشر باب».\n\nفي عام 1033م، تعرض المسجد لاضرار بليغه بسبب وقوع زلزال اخر. وفي عهد الخليفه الفاطمي الظاهر تم اصلاح الاضرار، وتجديد المسجد بين عامي 1034 و1036م. وتم تخفيض عدد الاروقه جذريا من خمسه عشر الى سبعه. وفي عهد الظاهر بنيت الاروقه الاربعه من القاعه المركزيه والممر الذي يستخدم حاليا كاساس للمسجد. وقد كان الممر المركز ضعف عرض الممرات الاخرى، وقد وصف الجغرافي الفارسي ناصر بن خسرو المسجد الاقصى خلال زيارته له عام 1047م:\n\n.\n\nالحمله الصّليبيّه\nفي عام 1099م، سيطر الصليبيون على القدس، اثناء الحمله الصليبيه الاولى. وبدلا من تدمير المسجد اطلقوا عليه اسم معبد سليمان، وقد استخدمه الصليبيون اولًا كقصر ملكي واسطبل للخيول. وفي عام 1119م، تم تحويله الى مقر لفرسان الهيكل. وخلال هذه الفتره، خضع المسجد الى بعض التغييرات الهيكليه، بما في ذلك توسيع الشرفه الشماليه، واضافه حنيه (محراب الكنيسه) وجدار فاصل. وقد تم بناء دير جديد وكنيسه ايضًا في الموقع، جنبًا الى جنب مع غيرها من الهياكل المختلفه وقد شيد فرسان المعبد اقباء ومرفقاتها في الجهه الغربيه والشرقيه للمبنى؛ ويستعمل القبو الغربي حاليًا كمسجد للنساء اما الشرقي فيستخدم كمتحف اسلامي.\nبعد حصار 1187م استطاع صلاح الدين الايوبي باستعاده القدس من يد الصليبيين، واجريت العديد من الاصلاحات والتجديدات في المسجد الاقصى. من اجل اعداد المسجد لاداء صلاه الجمعه، وفي غضون اسبوع من استعاده صلاح الدين للقدس تم ازاله المراحيض ومخازن الحبوب المثبته من قبل الصليبيين في الاقصى، وقد تم ايضا ازاله الارضيات المغطاه بالسجاد الثمين، وباطنها المعطر بماء الورد والبخور، وقد كلف نور الدين الزنكي، ببناء منبر جديد مصنوع من العاج والخشب في 1168-1169م، ولكن تم الانتهاء منه بعد وفاته، وقد قام صلاح الدين باضافه منبر نور الدين زنكي الى المسجد في نوفمبر 1187م، وفي عام 1218م، تم تشييد الرواق الشمالي للمسجد مع ثلاث بوابات في عهد المعظم السلطان الايوبي لدمشق، وفي عام 1345م، تم اضافه اضاف اثنين من البلاطات وبوابتين على الجانب الشرقي للمسجد، بامر من السلطان المملوكي الكامل سيف الدين شعبان ابن قلاوون.\nوبعد وصول العثمانيين الى السلطه في 1517م، لم يقوموا باي تجديدات او اصلاحات للمسجد نفسه، لكن قاموا ببعض الاضافات للحرم الشريف ككل. وشمل ذلك بناء نافوره قاسم باشا عام 1527م، وتم ترميم بركه الرارانج، وبناء ثلاث قباب قائمه بذاتها، وابرزها قبه النبي التي بنيت في عام 1538م. وقد اهتم الولاه العثمانيين في القدس بالمسجد كثيرا وجعلوه في مقدمه اولياتهم.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nالتجديد الاول للمسجد الاقصى في القرن العشرين حدث في عام 1922، عندما كلف المجلس الاسلامي الاعلى تحت امين الحسيني (مفتي القدس الكبرى) المهندس المعماري التركي احمد كيماليتين استعاده المسجد الاقصى والمعالم الاثريه في ساحاته. كما ان المجلس ايضا قام بتكليف المهندسين المعماريين البريطانيين وخبراء مصريين والمسؤولين المحليين للمساهمه والاشراف على الاصلاحات والاضافات التي نفذها كيماليتين مابين 1924–1925. وقد شملت التجديدات تعزيز الاسس الامويه القديمه للمسجد، وتصحيح الاعمده الداخليه، لتحل محل العوارض ونصب السقالات، وشملت ايضا التجديدات ترميم الاقواس والمنطقه الداخليه للقبه الرئيسيه وكيفيه الحفاظ عليها، وقد تم اعاده بناء الجدار الجنوبي، واستبدال الاخشاب في الصحن المركزي بكتله من الخرسانه. وكشفت التجديدات ايضا عن فسيفساء تعود الى العصر الفاطمي، وايضا اكتشف وجود نقوش على الاقواس الداخليه التي كانت مغطاه بالجبس. وقد زينت الاقواس بالذهب والجص الاخضر ملون واستبدلت الاخشاب بالنحاس. وجدد ربع نوافذ الزجاج المعشق ايضا بعنايه شديده حفاظا على تصاميمهم العباسيه والفاطميه الاصليه، وقد تعرض المسجد الاقصى لاضرار شديده بسبب وقوع زلازل ما بين 1927 و1937، وقد تم اصلاح الاضرار التي لحقت بالمسجد في عام 1938 و1942.\n\nحريق المسجد\nتعرض في صبيحه يوم الخميس الموافق 22 اغسطس 1969م لحريق على يد يهودي استرالي متطرف اسمه مايكل دينس روهن، حيث تم حرق الجامع القبلي الذي سقط سقف قسمه الشرقي بالكامل، كما احترق منبر صلاح الدين، الذي امر ببنائه نور الدين زنكي قبل تحرير المسجد الاقصى من الصليبيين وقام (صلاح الدين الايوبي) بوضعه داخل المسجد بعد التحرير، وقد قال روهن تعقيبا على الحريق الذي افتعله انه كان يامل من احراق المسجد الاقصى كان من شانه ان يعجل المجيء الثاني للمسيح، مما يجعل الطريق لاعاده بناء الهيكل اليهودي المزعوم على جبل الهيكل. وادخل روهن الى مصحه الامراض العقليه، وردا على الحادث، تم عقد قمه للدول الاسلاميه في الرباط في العام نفسه، الذي استضافه الملك فيصل. ويعتبر حريق الاقصى احد العوامل المحفزه لتشكيل منظمه المؤتمر الاسلامي (والان منظمه التعاون الاسلامي)، وفي عام 1972، تم ترميم المسجد الاقصى والمنبر معه، وتتولى الاردن ترميم واصلاح المسجدين على نفقتها الخاصه كلما دعا الامر لذلك.\nفي الثمانينيات من القرن الماضي، تامر بن شوشان ويهودا اتزيون وكلاهما عضو في منظمه غوش ايمونيم السريه، لتفجير المسجد الاقصى وقبه الصخره. اما اتزيون فقد كان يعتقد ان تفجير اثنين من المساجد سوف يتسبب بصحوه روحيه في الكيان الصهيوني، وسوف يحل جميع مشاكل اليهود. كما اعرب كل من بن شونان واتزينون عن املهم في بناء المعبد الثالث في القدس وتحديداً في موقع المسجد الاقصى. وفي 15 يناير 1988، خلال الانتفاضه الاولى، اطلقت القوات الصهيونيه الرصاص المطاطي والغاز المسيل للدموع على المتظاهرين خارج المسجد، مما ادى الى اصابه 40 من المصلين. وفي 8 اكتوبر 1990، قتل 22 فلسطينياً واصيب اكثر من 100 اخرين من «شرطه الحدود الصهيونيه» خلال الاحتجاجات التي تم تشغيلها بواسطه الاعلان عن «جبل الهيكل»، على يد مجموعه من اليهود المتدينين، الذين كانوا في طريقهم لوضع حجر الاساس للهيكل الثالث المزعوم.\n\nالقرن 21\nفي 28 سبتمبر 2000، قام ارئيل شارون واعضاء من حزب الليكود، جنبا الى جنب مع 1000 حارس مسلح، بزياره المسجد الاقصى، مما تسبب بمظاهره كبيره من الفلسطينيين احتجاجا على هذه الزياره، وبدا الفلسطينيون من الحرم القدسي برمي الحجاره على الشرطه الاسرائيليه. التي قامت باطلاق الغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي على الحشد مما اسفر عن مقتل اربعه واصابه حوالي 200 شخص، مما اسفر عن اصابه 24 شخصًا. وقد اثارت هذه الزياره انتفاضه لمده خمس سنوات على يد الفلسطينيين، ويُشار اليها باسم «انتفاضه الاقصى»، ويرى بعض المعلقين، نقلاً عن خطب لاحقه من قبل مسؤولين في السلطه الفلسطينيه، وخاصه عماد الفالوجي وعرفات نفسه، ان الانتفاضه كانت مخططه مسبقا قبل اشهر من هذه الزياره ، ربما في يوليو او تموز عند عوده ياسر عرفات من محادثات كامب ديفيد.\nومع اندلاع الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثالثه شدد الاحتلال الاسرائيلي القيود على دخول المسجد الاقصى من تحديد اعمار المصلين، فلا يسمح لمن هم دون الـ45 سنه من سكان الضفه الغربيه من دخول المسجد بدون تصاريح، حتى في اهم واقدس المناسبات الاسلاميه مثل شهر رمضان المبارك، اما بالنسبه لسكان قطاع غزه فلا يسمح الا لاعداد قليله من كبار السن ممن تتجاوز اعمارهم 50 سنه بدخول المسجد الاقصى وبتصاريح خاصه.\n\nقرار اليونيسكو سنه 2016\nفي يوم 14 اكتوبر 2016، اتخذت لجنه البرامج والعلاقات الخارجيه في المجلس التنفيذي لمنظمه اليونسكو قرارًا جاء فيه ان المنظمه تعتبر المسجد الاقصى احد المقدسات الاسلاميه، بدون ذكر وجود اي علاقه تاريخيه بين اليهود والمسجد، ومستنكره اقتحامه المتكرر من قبل بعض المتطرفين الاسرائيليين ومن قبل الجيش الاسرائيلي. وجاء هذا القرار استجابهً لمشروع تم تقديمه من قبل الجزائر ومصر ولبنان والمغرب وعمان وقطر والسودان. وقد رحبت عده منظمات وهيئات اسلاميه بالقرار وفي مقدمتها منظمه التعاون الاسلامي ومرصد الجامع الازهر، وهيئه علماء المسلمين في العراق، الى جانب الحكومه والفصائل الفلسطينيه. بالمقابل، قالت مصادر اسرائيليه ان الحكومه تسعى الى تليين قرار اليونيسكو سالف الذكر، وان اسرائيل تجري اتصالات دبلوماسيه حثيثه لتليين صيغه نص القرار. وقال محللين اخرين ايضًا ان هذا تاكيد دولي على ان القدس منطقه محتله، وعلى اسرائيل التفاوض بشانها.\n\nمنع الصلاه في المسجد سنه 2017\nفي يوم الجمعه 20 شوال 1438هـ الموافق فيه 14 يوليو 2017م، قالت الشرطه الاسرائيليه انها قررت منع صلاه الجمعه في المسجد الاقصى لهذا اليوم واغلاق ابوابه حتى اشعار اخر، وذلك في اعقاب عمليه اطلاق نار وقعت صباح نفس اليوم المذكور افضت الى استشهاد ثلاثه شبان فلسطينيين وقتل ثلاثه من افراد الشرطه الاسرائيليه بالقرب من باب الاسباط بالقدس. ونشرت الشرطه المذكوره تصريح مكتوب قالت فيه ان قائدها العام في القدس «يهورام هاليفي» قرر اغلاق ابواب المسجد، واعلانه منطقه عسكريه يمنع بموجبها على المصلين دخوله اضافه الى البلده القديمه في القدس، لتكون تلك المره الاولى التي تقفل فيها ابواب المسجد امام المصلين منذ سنه 1969م، وذلك في اليوم التالي لاقدام اليهودي المتطرف مايكل دينس روهن على محاوله احراق المسجد. بِالمُقابل قال مكتب رئيس الوزراء الاسرائيلي بنيامين نتنياهو ان الاغلاق هو ليوم واحد فقط. وعندما اُعلن هذا الامر، دعا المفتي العام للقدس والديار الفلسطينيه الشيخ محمد حسين الى شد الرحال للاقصى والتواجد على الحواجز وفي الساحات لاقامه صلاه الجمعه، وقال ان «لا قوه على وجه الارض ستمنعهم من التوجه للاقصى واقامه صلاه الجمعه فيه». بالمقابل شرعت منظمات واحزاب يهوديه بحمله تحريض واسعه بحق المسجد الاقصى والمصلين، عقب عمليه اطلاق النار سالِفه الذِكر، وقال عضو الكنيست من حزب البيت اليهودي «موتي يوغاف» الى اغلاق المسجد الاقصى بوجه المسلمين لفتره دائمه، وقالت منظمه جبل الهيكل الى الرد على عمليه القدس عبر زياده بناء المستوطنات اليهوديه وزياده ساعات الاقتحام للاقصى، كما قال نائب وزير الجيش الاسرائيلي، الحاخام ايلي بن دهان، انه يجب على اليهود ان يعززوا قبضتهم على المسجد الاقصى، وضمان ان يصلي كل يهودي فيه بامان وفي كل وقت.\n\nوفي يوم 22 شوال 1438هـ الموافق فيه 16 يوليو 2017م، نصبت السُلطات الاسرائيليه بوَّابات تفتيش الكترونيَّه على عدد من ابواب الاقصى في سبيل تعزيز اجراءاتها الامنيَّه، بِالاضافه الى كاميرات مُراقبه لِلاطلاع على ما يجري داخل باحات المسجد. ثُمَّ اعلن وزير الامن الداخلي الاسرائيلي جلعاد اردان افتتاح بابيّ الاسباط والمجلس المُؤديان الى المسجد، لكنَّهُ في نفس الوقت قال انَّ «اسرائيل هي صاحبه السياده في المسجد، وموقف الدُول الاُخرى ليس مهماً» وانَّ «اسرائيل اذا قررت فعل شيء في القدس ستُنفذه». وقد رفض موظفو الاوقاف الاسلاميَّه الدُخول الى المسجد ومُباشره اعمالهم احتجاجًا على هذه الخطوه الاسرائيليَّه. ايضًا رفض عامَّه الناس الانصياع للاجراءات الاسرائيليَّه ورفضوا دخول المسجد عبر هذه البوابات، وتجمهروا امام باب الاسباط لِاداء الصلاه، واعلنوا الاعتصام لِلحيلوله دون تحويل وضع المسجد الاقصى الى ما يشبه الوضع القائم في المسجد الابراهيمي بالخليل والابقاء على البوابات الالكترونيه بشكلٍ دائم. استمرَّ الوضع قائمًا على هذه الحال بضعه ايَّام، فتظاهر المقدسيُّون وتابعوا اعتصامهم امام ابواب المسجد الاقصى، وتخلل ذلك بعض الاشتباكات مع الشرطه الاسرائيليَّه، وفي يوم 4 ذي القعده 1438هـ الموافق فيه 27 يوليو 2017م اعلنت الشرطه الاسرائيليه ازاله كل الاجراءات الامنيه التي استحدثتها وعوده الوضع الى ما كان عليه قبل وقوع الهُجوم الذي ادى الى مقتل ثلاثه من افراد الشرطه، فعمَّت الاحتفالات مدينه القدس ابتهاجًا بفتح ابواب المسجد الاقصى، واقيمت الصلوات في مواعيدها المعتاده بداخل الحرم يومذاك. وبعد اعاده افتتاح المسجد ببضعه ايَّام، وتحديدًا يوم 8 ذي القعده 1438هـ، كشف رئيس مركز القدس الدولي حسن خاطر، ان السلطات الاسرائيليه صادرت وثائق مهمه كانت محفوظه بداخله، تتعلق باملاك واوقاف القدس واراضيها، وذلك اثناء فتره اغلاقه امام المسلمين. وحذَّر من كارثه كبيره تحوم حول الحرم القدسي نظرًا لان اسرائيل تمهد للتلاعب بالوثائق التي استولت عليها بهدف الحاق الضرر بالاوقاف، التي تشكل املاكها ما نسبته 90% من البلده القديمه، مقسمه بين عقارات واراضٍ ووقف اسلامي. بعد هذا الاكتشاف، شكَّلت دائره الاوقاف الاسلاميه بالقدس لجنه فنيه لحصر حجم المفقودات من الوثائق المسروقه للتحرك ضد اسرائيل.\n\nاقتحام المسجد الاقصى 2022\nفي صباح يوم الجمعه الموافق 15 ابريل 2022 قامت قوات الاحتلال الاسرائيلي باقتحام المسجد الاقصى، مستخدمهً قنابل الغاز المسيل للدموع والقنابل الصوتيه، مما ادى الى اصابه ما لا يقل عن 90 فلسطينياً بجروح.\n\nالعماره\nالمسجد الاقصى هو المنطقه المحاطه بالسور المستطيل الواقعه في جنوب شرق مدينه القدس المسوره والتي تعرف بالبلده القديمه. وتبلغ مساحه المسجد قرابه الـ 144 دونماً ويشمل قبه الصخره والمسجد الاقصى حسب الصوره المرفقه، وعده معالم اخرى يصل عددها الى 200 معلم. ويقع المسجد الاقصى فوق هضبه صغيره تسمى هضبه موريا وتعتبر الصخره هي اعلى نقطه في المسجد وتقع في موقع القلب بالنسبه للمسجد الاقصى الشريف.\nوتبلغ قياسات المسجد: من الجنوب 281 مترا ومن الشمال 310 امتار ومن الشرق 462 مترا ومن الغرب 491 مترا. وتشكل هذه المساحه سدس مساحه البلده القديمه، وهذه الحدود لم تتغير منذ وضع المسجد اول مره كمكان للصلاه بخلاف المسجد الحرام والمسجد النبوي اللذين تم توسعيهما عده مرات.\nوللمسجد الاقصى اربعه ماذن هي مئذنه باب المغاربه الواقعه الجنوب الغربي، مئذنه باب السلسله الواقعه في الجهه الغربيه قرب باب السلسله، مئذنه باب الغوانمه الواقعه في الشمال الغربي، ومئذنه باب الاسباط الواقعه في الجهه الشماليه.\n\nمعالم المسجد الاقصى\nالمصليات\nيتكون المسجد الاقصى من سبع مصليات او مساجد معمده مع عده قاعات صغيره اضافيه من الجهه الغربيه والشرقيه من الجزء الجنوبي من المسجد. وقد كان يوجد 121 نافذه من الزجاج الملون في المسجد من عصور الخلافه العباسيه والفاطميه. تم استعاده حوالي ربعهم في عام 1924.\nوالمساجد هي:\n\n1 - الجامع القِبلي\n\nوهو الجامع المسقوف الذي تعلوه قبّه رصاصيه، والواقع في جنوبيّ المسجد الاقصى في جهه القِبله، ومن هنا جاءت تسميته بـ «القِبلي». ويُعتبر هذا الجامع المصلّى الرئيس الذي يخطب فيه الخطيب في صلاه الجمعه، كما انّه يُعتبر المصلّى الرئيس للرجال داخل المسجد الاقصى حيث يقف الامام، وحيث يوجد المحراب والمنبر الرئيسان. والبناء الحالي يعود للعصر الاموي، حيث بَدا العمل على تجديد بناءه الخليفه عبد الملك بن مروان، واتمّه ابنه الخليفه الوليد بن عبد الملك بين عامي 86 هـ-96 هـ الموافق 705-714م، وكان في الاصل مكونًا من 15 رواقًا، ثم اًعيد ترميمه بعد تعرّضه لزلازل ادّت لتصدّعه، واختُصِرت اروقته في عصر الخليفه الفاطمي الظاهر لاعزاز دين الله الى 7 اروقه، وفي وقتنا الحالي يتكوّن من رواق كبير في الوسط و3 اروقه في كل جانب. وللجامع قبّه مرتفعه داخليه مصنوعه من الخشب، تعلوها القبّه الرئيسه الخارجيّه والمُغطّاه بالواح الرصاص. وتبلغ مساحه الجامع حوالي 4 دونمات، طوله 80م وعرضه 55م، على اختلاف يسير بين طول ضلعه الشرقي والغربي، وله 11 بابًا، ويتّسع الى حوالي 5500 مصلّ.\nوكان اوّل من بناه هو عمر بن الخطاب عند الفتح الاسلامي عام 15 هـ، وذلك بعد ان استشار كعب الاحبار في مكان بناء المسجد، فاشار عليه في مكان الصخره، فرفض ذلك عمر وقال: «بل نجعل قبلته صدره كما جعل رسول الله صَلَّى الله عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ قبله مساجدنا صدورنا»، وكان بناؤه من الخشب، وكان يتّسع حوالي 1000 مصلّ، ثمّ جدّده الخليفه معاويه بن ابي سفيان، فصار يتّسع حوالي 3000 مصلّ. وعندما سيطر الصليبيون على القدس قسّموا الجامع القبلي الى ثلاثه اقسام: احدها تحوّل الى مكاتب، والاخر الى سكن لفرسان المعبد، والثالث الى كنيسه، وبقي الامر كذلك حتى عهد صلاح الدين الايوبي فرمّم المسجد عام 538 هـ الموافق 1187، ثم توالت الترميمات في عصر الدوله المملوكيه والدوله العثمانيه لاحقًا. وفي العصر الحديث، وبعد احتلال اليهود لفلسطين، بقي الجامع القبلي تحت تهديد اليهود، فعمدوا الى اعمال حفر تحت اغلب الجدار الجنوبي للمسجد وتحت اساسات الجامع القبلي كلها مما هدّدت اساساته، كما تعرّض الجامع القبلي لحريق مفتعل وذلك يوم 21 اغسطس 1969 على يد مايكل دينس روهن، فاحترق منبر نور الدين زنكي، وامتد الحريق ليشمل اغلب الاروقه الثلاثه الشرقيه، بالاضافه الى سقفه الخشبي.\nوفي يناير 2007، ذكر عدنان الحسيني – رئيس دائره الاوقاف الاسلاميه والمسؤول عن كتائب شهداء – انه سيجري تركيب منبر جديد؛ وقد جرى تثبيته في فبراير 2007. كما ان تصميم المنبر الجديد هو من تصميم جمال بدران استناداً الى نسخه طبق الاصل من منبر صلاح الدين الايوبي، وقد عمل عليه بدران مده خمس سنوات. المنبر نفسه جرى بناؤه في الاردن في مده اربع سنوات، واستخدم الحرفيين اساليب النجاره القديمه لبنائه، واستعمل قطع من اوتاد بدلاً من المسامير لتثبيته.\n\n2 - المصلى المرواني\n\nويقع في اسفل الزاويه الجنوبيه الشرقيه للمسجد الاقصى، وكان يُعرَف قديمًا «بالتسويه الشرقيه»، وقد بناه الامويون كتسويه معماريه لهضبه بيت المقدس الاصليه المنحدره جهه الجنوب، حتى يتسنّى البناء فوق قسمها الجنوبيّ. ويتكوّن المصلّى المرواني من 16 رواقًا، وتبلغ مساحته الاجماليه اكثر من 4000 مترًا مربعًا، وهي اكبر مساحه مُغطاه للصلاه في المسجد الاقصى. عندما سيطر الصليبيون على المسجد الاقصى، قاموا بتحويل المصلّى المرواني الى اسطبلات للخيول، وسمّوه «اسطبلات سليمان»، وهي تسميّه توراتيه نسبهً الى النبي سليمان. وبعد تحرير المسجد الاقصى في عهد صلاح الدين الايوبي، اعاد المصلى المرواني الى استعماله السابق باعتباره تسويهً ومخزنًا. وبقي الامر كذلك حتى عام 1996، حيث تم افتتاحه كمُصلّى وسُمي يومئذٍ بالمُصلّى المرواني نسبهً الى عبد الملك بن مروان.\nوكان سبب افتتاحه كمُصلّى هو تسريب وثيقه سريّه لتقسيم المسجد الاقصى باعتبار ما تحت الارض لليهود وما فوق الارض للمسلمين وذلك في عام 1995، بعد ذلك قررت عده هيئات اسلاميه البدء بالعمل على فتح المصلّى المرواني، فبدات بتنظيف المكان، ومدّ الكهرباء اليه واضاءته، ثم تبليط المصلّى، وتبرعت مصر بفرش المصلّى، وتم فتح عدّه ابواب له. وكان هذا العمل الذي تم هو السبب المُعلَن للزياره التي قام بها ارئيل شارون للمسجد يوم الخميس 28 سبتمبر 2000، والتي ادّت لانطلاق انتفاضه الاقصى والتي استمرت 5 سنوات.\n3 - مصلى الاقصى القديم\n\nويقع هذا المصلّى تحت الجامع القبلي، يدخل اليه عبر درج يقع قرب الرواق الاوسط في الجهه الشماليه للجامع القبلي، وهو عباره عن ممر يتكون من رواقين باتجاه الجنوب بناه الامويون ليكون مدخلاً ملكيًا الى المسجد الاقصى من القصور الامويه التي تقع خارج حدود الاقصى من الجهه الجنوبيه. ويوجد عند المدخل الشمالي منه غرفه صغيره كانت تستخدم للحرس، كما يوجد غرفه اكبر تقع عند بقايا الباب المزدوج عند المدخل الجنوبي للمصلّى والتي كانت تستخدم للحرس ايضًا، وهي تحتوي على محراب في مدخلها، ويوجد بئر عميق ومغلق الان. ومن العناصر المعماريه المميزه فيه وجود قبّتان امويتان مسطحتان تقومان فوق مدخله الجنوبي، وعندهما يوجد اعمده حجريه ضخمه تشكل الاساس الذي تقوم عليه منطقه قبه الجامع القبلي، وقد رُممت عام 1927. بتمويل من الملك فاروق من مصر، وقد كان هذا المصلّى مغلقًا لا يُفتح الا في حالات الضروري حتى عام 1998، حيث تم تنظيفه واعداده ليكون مكانًا ملائمًا للصلاه، وهو يتّسع لحوالي 1000 مصلّ.\n4 - مسجد قبّه الصخره\n\nوتعتبر قبّته احدى اهم وابرز المعالم المعماريه الاسلامي، واقدم بناء اسلامي بقي محافظًا على شكله وزخرفته في الاغلب. بنى هذه القبّه الخليفه عبد الملك بن مروان، حيث بدا في بنائها عام 66 هـ الموافق 685م، وانتهى منها عام 72 هـ الموافق 691م، واشرف على بنائها المهندسان رجاء بن حيوه الكندي، وهو من التابعين المعروفين، ويزيد بن سلام مولى عبد الملك بن مروان. وقبّه الصخره عباره عن بناء مثمن الاضلاع له اربعه ابواب، وفي داخله تثمينه اخرى تقوم على دعامات واعمده اسطوانيه، في داخلها دائره تتوسطها «الصخره المشرفه» التي يعتقد المسلمون بان النبي محمد صعد منها الى السماء في رحله الاسراء والمعراج، وترتفع هذه الصخره نحو 1.5 مترًا عن ارضيه البناء، وهي غير منتظمه الشكل يتراوح قطرها بين 13 و18 مترًا، وتوجد مغاره تُسمّى «مغاره الارواح» اسفل جزء منها تعلوها فتحه، وتعلو الصخره في الوسط قبّه دائره بقطر حوالي 20 مترًا، مطليه من الخارج بالواح الذهب، ارتفاعها 35م، يعلوها هلال بارتفاع 5م. ويعتقد بعض الباحثين ان بناتها خططوا لجعلها قبه للمسجد الاقصى كاملاً.\n5 - مسجد البراق\n\nويقع في الناحيه الجنوبيه الغربيه من المسجد الاقصى، وسُمّي بذلك نسبهً الى المكان الذي ربط فيه النبي محمد دابته البراق في رحله الاسراء والمعراج، وفيه حلقه عثمانيه يُقال انّها وُضعت في مكان الحلقه التي رُبط عندها البراق. كما يحتوي المسجد على محراب اموي، وكان يوجد في جهته الغربيه باب قديم يُسمّى «باب البراق» وقد اُغلق بعد العهد الاموي، والذي كان يصل مباشره الى ساحه البراق خارج المسجد الاقصى، وينزل الى مصلّى البراق حاليًا من خلال الرواق الغربي للاقصى بدرجات حجريه، والذي يُفتح كل يوم جمعه للزياره.\n6 - مسجد المغاربه\nويقع في الزاويه الجنوبيه الغربيه من المسجد الاقصى جنوبي حائط البراق، وله بابان، واحد مُغلق في الجهه الشماليه، واخر مفتوح في الجهه الشرقيه. ويُستعمل اليوم كقاعه عرض لاغراض المتحف الاسلامي الذي نُقل من الرباط المنصوري الى هذا المسجد وذلك في عام 1348 هـ الموافق 1929. وقد قيل انّ اوّل من بناه هو صلاح الدين الايوبي سنه 590 هـ الموافق 1193، وكانت تُقام فيه الصلاه على المذهب المالكي.\n7 - جامع النساء\nويقع داخل المسجد الاقصى، ويمثّل الجزء الجنوبي الغربي منه، حيث يمتد بمحاذاه حائطه الجنوبي بدءًا من الجدار الغربي للجامع القِبلي وحتى الحائط الغربي للمسجد. وهو اليوم مُقسّم الى ثلاثه اقسام: اولها غربي ملحق بالمتحف الاسلامي، وثانيها في الوسط وبه توجد مكتبه الاقصى الرئيسيه، وثالثها شرقي ملاصق للجامع القبلي، ويُستعمل الان كمستودع. وجامع النساء عباره عن بناء كبير واسع مرتفع عن مستوى الجامع القبلي، ويرى باحثون بان بناءه يعود الى العهد الصليبي، حيث بُني ككنيسه، ليعيده صلاح الدين الايوبي لمُصلّى خُصّص للنساء.\n8-مصلى باب الرحمه\n\nانشا الاميون باب الرحمه ليكون مشتركا بين سور القدس التاريخي والمسجد الاقصى، وبُني المصلى ملاصقا له، فمنذ العهد الاموي حتى العباسي بقي المصلى مفتوحا، وتعمد الفرنجه خلال احتلالهم للمدينه فتح المصلى في ايام عيد الفصح، وبعد تحرير القدس اغلق القائد صلاح الدين الايوبي الباب المشترك بين السور والمسجد لاسباب امنيه واعاد استخدام المبنى للصلاه وظل كذلك في العهدين المملوكي والعثماني.اُهمل المكان في فتره الاحتلال البريطاني التي اتسمت بالتضييق على المصلين لكنه بقي مفتوحا امامهم طيله العهدين البريطاني والاردني، ومع مجيء الاحتلال الاسرائيلي عام 1967 تم تهميش المصلى، لكنه عاد وانتعش عام 1992 عندما بات مقرا للجنه التراث الاسلامي التي حُظرت عام 2003 وكان ذلك الاجراء الذريعه التي اتخذها الاحتلال لاغلاق المصلى المستهدف، وفي العام 2018 وضعت نقطه حراسه لشرطه الاحتلال الاسرائيلي اعلى المصلى، وفي العام 2019 وضعت قوات الاحتلال قفل على البوابه المؤديه للمصلى وهو ما فجّر هبّه شعبيه ادت لاعاده فتح المصلى، ومنذ اعاده فتح المصلى استهدفت شرطه الاحتلال الحراس والمصلين وكافه المبادرات الراميه لاعمار المصلى وتهيئته لاستقبال المصلين.\n\nواجهه المسجد والشرفه\nالواجهه\n\nتم بناء واجهه المسجد في عام 1065م، بناء على تعليمات من الخليفه الفاطمي المستنصر بالله. مع درابزين (بهو) يتكون من ممرات واعمده الصغيره. وقد تضررت الواجهه خلال الحقبه الصليبيه خلال حكمهم لفلسطين، ولكن تم ترميمها وتجديدها في العهد الايوبي. بالاضافه الى ذلك تم تغطيه الواجهه بالبلاط. اما المواد المستعمله في اقواس الواجهه فهي مواد زينه منحوته اخذت من الهياكل الصليبيه في القدس. كما يوجد اربعه عشر قوس حجري على طول الواجهه معظمها من نمط العماره الرومانسكيه، اما الاقواس الخارجيه التي اضيفت في العهد المملوكي فقد اتبعت نفس التصميم العام. كما يوجد قوس مركزي عند مدخل واجهه المسجد.\n\nالشرفه\nالشرفه تقع في الجزء العلوي من الواجهه. والخلجان المركزيه من الشرفه فهي تعود لفتره فرسان الهيكل اثناء الحمله الصليبيه الاولى، اما الشرفه نفسها فقد امر ببنائها المعظم ابن العادل ابو بكر بن ايوب اخ صلاح الدين الايوبي وذلك عام 1217م.\n\nالقباب\nيحتوي المسجد الاقصى عده قباب جميله تعد من ابرز معالمه واحدى التحف الاسلاميه الخالده، واجملها كما انها تضفي عليه جواً قدسياً، خاصه درتها قبه الصخره المشرفه الواقعه في قلب المسجد الاقصى المبارك. والمعلوم ان المسجد الاقصى يحتوي على خمسه عشره قبه وهي:\n\nقبه الصخره\n\nقبه الصخره هي المبنى المثمن ذو القبه الذهبيه، وموقعها بالنسبه للمسجد الاقصى ككل كموقع القلب من جسد الانسان اي انها تقع في وسطه الى اليسار قليلاً. وهذه القبه تعتبر هي قبه المسجد ككل، وهي من اقدم واعظم المعالم الاسلاميه المتميزه. ويعود تاريخ تاشييدها الى العهد الاموي عام 72هـ (692م)، وسميت بهذا الاسم نسبه الى الصخره التي تقع داخل المبنى والتي عرج منها النبي النبي محمد الى السماء في ليله الاسراء والمعراج على ارجح الاقوال لان الصخره هي اعلى بقعه في المسجد الاقصى. وقبه الصخره هي حالياً مصلى النساء في المسجد الاقصى. والصخره غير معلقه كما يعتقد عامه الناس، لكنه يوجد اسفلها مغاره صغيره.\n\nقبه السلسله.\n\nوتقع قبه السلسله داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك شرقي قبه الصخره، وتم تشييدها بناء على اوامر الخليفه الاموي عبد الملك بن مروان عام 72هـ (692م)، ويشير ابن عبد ربه مؤلف كتاب العقد الفريد، ان سبب تسميتها بقبه السلسله انه كانت توجد بها سلسله يمسها المتقاضون وان هذه السلسله حليف كل صديق في القول وانها تبتعد عن كل من يكذب وتربط هذه الروايات بين هذه السلسله وتلك التي كان يتخذها النبي داود لحسم النزاع بين الخصوم في مجلس القضاء، وهذا لاشك من الخزعبلات غير المقبوله.\nومن المعروف ان هذه القبه قد تعرضت للانتهاك اثناء الحملات الصليبيه واعيد تجديدها عده مرات منذ استرداد صلاح الدين الايوبي بيت المقدس وقد اوقفت سلطات الاحتلال الصهيوني عمليات الترميم التي كانت جاريه بها في عام 1970م ، ثم استكملت في التسعينات من القرن الماضي.\nوقبه السلسله هي على شكل سداسي يحملها مضلع مسدس مؤلف داخلياً من سته اعمده، تحمل تحمل بدورها العقود التي يرتكز عليها عامود القبه، وخارجها احد عشر عموداً تحمل عقوداً مماثله وقد سد فيما بعد بين اثنين من هذه الاعمده لانشاء المحراب الموجود بها وعلى ذلك فان لهذه القبه سبعه عشر عموداً، وقد كسيت هذه القبه ببلاطات من القاشاني التركي عند ترميمها في عهد السلطان سليمان القانوني في القرن 16م.\n\nقبه النحويه.\n\nتقع القبه النحويه في الطرف الجنوب الغربي لساحه قبه الصخره، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى العهد الايوبي عام 1207 على يد الامير حسام الدين ابي معد قمباز في عهد الملك شرف الدين ابو المنصور عيسى الايوبي، لتكون مدرسه متخصصه لتعليم العلوم اللغويه من صرف ونحو داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك، فعرفت بالقبه النحويه، وايضا المدرسه النحويه.\nتتكون القبه من ثلاث غرف متصله، حيث تقوم قبتها الكبرى فوق الغرفه الغربيه، بينما توجد قبه اخرى اقل ارتفاعا فوق الغرفه الشرقيه، ولها مدخل رّئيسي يقع في واجهتها الشّماليه.\nتحولت القبه النحويه الى مكتبه في عهد الاحتلال البريطاني، وتستعمل اليوم كمقر لمحكمه الاستئناف الشرعيه (وهو جزء من المحكمه الشرعيه في القدس، والذي يتبع بدوره للاردن)، واسمها الدقيق الان هو: مكتب القائم باعمال قاضي القضاه، ومن تحتها ارشيف المحكمه.\nوقد حماها هذا الاستعمال هو من اخطار الاحتلال، حيث انها تشرف بشكل واضح على حائط البراق من داخل الاقصى المبارك، كما تشرف على بابي المغاربه وباب السلسله. ولذلك تعتبر نقطهً ساخنهً عند وقوع اعتداءات صهيونيه على المسجد الاقصى المبارك، كما حدث في انتفاضه الاقصى عام 2000م، حيث اقتحم الصهاينه الاقصى من باب السلسله، وسيطروا على القبه النحويه، ومن ثم سيطروا على الجهه الجنوبيه الغربيه من المسجد الاقصى المبارك، وقتلوا شهيدا عند باب المغاربه، وقد استشهد 5 مصلين برصاص الاحتلال في ذلك اليوم، فضلا عن اصابه العشرات.\n\nقبه الارواح\nوتقع قبه الارواح داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك بالقرب من قبه المعراج، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى العهد العثماني في منتصف القرن 16م.\nوقد شيدت هذه القبه على مضلع مثمن الاضلاع يتالف من ثمانيه اعمده رخاميه تحمل ثمانيه عقود حجريه وهي قبه قليله الارتفاع بعض الشيء.\n\nقبه النبي سليمان\n\nوتقع قبه النبي سليمان داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك من الجهه الشماليه ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى العهد الاموي وعلى الارجح في عهد الخليفه سليمان بن عبد الملك.\nوتقوم هذه القبه ايضا على بناء مثمن يبدا باربعه من الرخام وتم تخصيص واحده منها لباب الدخول يواجه المحراب، وفوق المثمن تم تشييد عامود اسطواني وقد فتحت به ثمانيه نوافذ معقوده للاضاءه، وفوق هذا العامود خوذه القبه وهي حجريه متينه البنيان وبداخل هذه القبه توجد صخره صغيره.\n\nقبه الخضر\n\nوتقع قبه الخضر داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك في الزاويه الشماليه الغربيه لساحه قبه الصخره، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى الفتره العثمانيه، وتقوم هذه القبه على سته اعمده رخاميه رشيقه وتحمل هذه الاعمده عقودا حجريه مدببه ومزخرفه.\n\nقبه المعراج\n\nوتقع قبه المعراج داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك الى الشمال الغربي من قبه الصخره. وشيدت عام 1200م بامر من الامير عز الدين الزنجلي والي القدس في عهد السلطان العادل ابو بكر بن ايوب. وتم تشييدها لتخليد ذكرى المعراج، وتذكر بعض المصادر ان هذه القبه بنيت مكان قبه اخرى قديمه تعود الى عهد عبد الملك بن مروان، وقد اشار الى وجودها الرحاله ناصر بن خسرو قبل استيلاء الصليبيين على المدينه وهدمهم لها.\n\nويعتبر التصميم المعماري للقبه فريد من نوعه وهو مثمن الشكل مثل قبه الصخره المجاوره له، ونجد في كل ركن من اركان المثمن اربعه اعمده مدمجه الا الجهه الجنوبيه التي بها عمودان ليصبح مجموع الاعمده ثلاثين عمودا، وتحمل الاعمده ثمانيه عقود مدببه سدت فتحاتها بالرخام فيما عدا ضلع واحد يقع في الناحيه الجنوبيه، وقد شيد به محراب حجري تبرز حنيته من الخارج، ويقابله ضلع اخر في الناحيه الشماليه فتح به باب الدخول الى القبه، وقد شيدت خوذه القبه بعد تحويل اعلى المثمن الى دائره، وتتميز هذه القبه بوجود قبه اخرى صغيره فوقها، بما يشبه التاج فوق راسها.\nوالقبه تستخدم اليوم من قبل لجنه الاعمار في المسجد الاقصى المبارك.\n\nقبه الميزان\n\nتقع قبه الميزان في الركن الجنوبي من صحن الصخره المشرفه، ملاصقه للبائكه الجنوبيه، والمعلوم ان بوائك الاقصى تعرف ايضا بالموازيين، ومنه جاءت تسميه القبه باسم قبه الميزان. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى الفتره المملوكيه على يد قاضي القضاه برهان الدين بن جماعه الذي انشاها عام 1388م، قبه الميزان وتعرف ايضا بمنبر برهان الدين وذلك لانها على هيئه منبر فوقه قبه.\nوقد ذكر بعض المؤرخين ان المنبر في بدايه عهده كان عباره عن منبر خشبي جميل في شكله، وفي عام 1388م اعيد بناء المنبر بالكامل من الحجر على النمط الهندسي الذي تشتهر به المنابر المملوكيه المعروفه بنقشها وجمالها.\nويتكون هذا المنبر من بناء حجري، وله مدخل يقوم في اعلاه عقد يرتكز على عمودين صغيرين من الرخام. ويُصعد منه الى درجات قليله تؤدي الى دكه حجريه معده لجلوس الخطيب، وتقوم فوقها قبه لطيفه صغيره، وقد اقيمت على اعمده رخاميه جميله الشكل.\nوقدد جُدّد المنبر مرتين الاولى في عهد السلطان العثماني عبد المجيد بن محمود الثاني عام 1843م، والثانيه في اواخر سنه 2000م، على يد مجموعه من الطلبه الايطاليين، وذلك عن طريق دائره الاوقاف الاسلاميه.\n\nقبه يوسف اغا\nتقع القبه داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك على الجانب الغربي من الجامع القبلي، وتم تشييدها عام 1092هـ (1681م) بامر من يوسف اغا الوالي العثماني على القدس، وقد كانت على ما يبدو مخصصه للعباده على مقربه من الجامع القبلي. وهي تغطي هذه القبه مساحه مربعه شيدت بمداميك من الاحجار المشذبه وقد فتحت ثلاثه جدران بكاملها تقريباً على ساحه المسجد الاقصى المبارك، وذلك باستخدام عقود مدببه بينما شيد المحراب في الجدار الجنوبي، وهو محراب مجوف بسيط.\n\nقبه النبي موسى\n\nوتقع قبه النبي موسى داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك على بالقرب من البائكه الجنوبيه الغربيه، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى عام 1250م في عهد الملك الصالح نجم الدين ايوب بن الملك الكامل الايوبي، ويبدو من تصميمها انها كانت مخصصه لتعبد امراء الايوبيين عند زيارتهم للقدس او لبعض المشاهير والشيوخ بعد ذلك.\nوالقبه هي مربعه الجدران فتحت بها نوافذ للاضاءه ، ويقع المدخل في الضلع الشمالي المواجه لجدار القبه ومن ناحيه الشكل فقد تم تحويل المربع الى مثمن، وقد فتحت في اضلاع المثمن نوافذ للاضاءه ، وبعد ذلك تم تشييد خوذه القبه المثمنه.\n\nقبه النبي\nوتقع قبه النبي داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك غرب قبه الصخره، بجوار قبه المعراج ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى عام 1538 بامر من محمد بك والي غزه والقدس الشريف ثم اعاد تشييدها السلطان العثماني عبد المجيد الاول عام 1845، اما عن سبب تسميتها فيعتقد بعض المؤرخين انها بنيت في المكان الذي صلى فيه النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم اماما بالانبياء والملائكه في ليله الاسراء، حيث تشير بعض النصوص الى انّ المعراج كان على يمين الصخره، ويقول الباحثون ان هذا سبب تعدد القباب على يمين قبه الصخره.\nكما يعتبر محراب النبي هو اول ما تم تشييده في هذه القبه، وقد امر بتشييدها محمد بك والي غزه والقدس الشريف في عهد السلطان العثماني سليمان القانوني في عام 1538م، والمحراب هو على هيئه مستطيل رخامي لا يرتفع عن الارض كثيراً، وفي نهايته شكل ثلاثي الاضلاع اكثر ارتفاعاً من بقيه المستطيل.\nوفي عام 1845م، قام السلطان عبد المجيد الثاني بتشييد قبه فوق هذا المحراب ومنها جاءت تسميتها، وهي مثمنه الشكل قاعدتها من ثمانيه اعمده رخاميه رشيقه تحمل ثمانيه من العقود الحجريه المدببه.\n\nقبه يوسف\n\nتقع قبه يوسف داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك جنوب قبه الصخره، ويعود تشييدها الى العهد العثماني عام 1681 م. وسميت القبه بقبه يوسف تيمناً وتذكاراً بيوسف بن ايوب المعروف بالناصر صلاح الدين الايوبي. وتقوم هذه القبه على بناء مربع تتالف قاعدته من عمودين رخاميين رشيقين وجدار في ناحيه القِبله، ومن ثم فهي عباره عن ثلاثه عقود مفتوحه وجدار مسدود وبوسط هذا الجدار حنيه صغيره تشبه المحاريب المجوفه وبداخلها نص على لوح يحمل اسم صلاح الدين الايوبي، وهذا اللوح ماخوذ من برج بناه السلطان صلاح الدين على سور المدينه عند الخندق. وخلف هذا النص من الخارج يوجد نص اخر يبين اعمال البناء التي اجريت في العهد العثماني، واسم المشرف على البناء وهو علي اغا يوسف اغا.\n\nقبه عشاق النبي\nتقع قبه عشاق النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك، في الركن الجنوب الشرقي من باب العتم، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى عام 1817م في عهد السلطان العثماني محمود الثاني، ولهذا السبب تعرف باسم ايوان السلطان محمود الثاني. واما اسمها الحالي فمصدره اعتياد بعض شيوخ الصوفيه الاجتماع للذكر تحتها.\nوهي عباره عن مبنـى مربع الشكل طول ضلعه 7 امتار، قائم على اربع دعائم ركنيّه تعلوها اربعه عقود مدببه تعلوها قبـه ضحله. والمبنى مفتوح الجوانب، وبه محراب حجري مجوف جميل اضيف في فتره لاحقه في وسط الجهه الجنوبيّه. ويصعد الـى صحن هذه القبه من خلال ثلاث درجات من الجهتين الغربيه والشرقيّه، وارضيتها مبلّطه بالحجر، وعلى حافتها من الجهه الشماليه عمودان نائمان يبدو انّهما وضعا في زمن متاخّر كدربزين\n\nقبه الشيخ الخليلي.\n\nتقع قبه الشيخ الخليلي في صحن الصخره، في جزء الشمال الغربي من قبه الصخره، وتفصل بينهما قبتا النبي والمعراج. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى العهد العثماني عام 1700م، وعرفت باسم شيخ صوفي كان يؤمها ويتعبد فيها، وتعرف كذلك بقبه بخ بخ، ومصلى الخضر، ومسجد النبي.\nوالقبه هي عباره عن مبنى مربّع مقام على اربعه اركان، تعلوه قبّه ضحله على الطراز العثماني، وفي الجهات الاربع ثماني نوافذ مستطيله الشكل. حيث يقع في واجهه المبنى الشرقيّه باب صغير يعلوه نقش يحمل اسم وتاريخ المبنى. ويوجد بداخل هذه القبه من جهه القبله محراب من حجر كلسي ملكي فيه حنيه حجريّه، وتحت مبنى قبه الخليلي يوجد مبنى سفلي يسمى مغاره الارواح، يتوصل اليه من خلال سلم حجري مقطوع من الصخر، وهذا الكهف قليل التهويه عديم النور ولا يستعمل.\nوتستعمل القبه اليوم كمكتب للجنه اعمار المسجد الاقصى المبارك.\n\nقبه النبي عيسى/ مهد النبي عيسى\n\nوتقع قبه النبي عيسى والمسماه ايضا مهد النبي عيسى عند الزاويه الجنوبيه الشرقيه لسور القدس وسور المسجد الاقصى، وتم تشييده لتخليد ذكرى النبي عيسى، ورغم التجديدات التي لحقت به على مر العصور فهو يحتفظ بطابعه الاصلي والاساسي والذي ورد في اوصاف المؤرخين والرحاله الذين عاينوا هذا المكان المعروف باسم مهد النبي عيسى ومسجده. وجددت القبه في العهد العثماني على نفس طرازها القديم وهي محموله على اربعه عقود مدببه تستند بدورها على اربعه اعمده رخاميه رشيقه، وتحت هذه القبه يوجد حوض حجري يسمى مهد النبي عيسى، وامام هذا الحوض يوجد محراب حجري مجوف.\n\nالماَذن\nللمسجد اربع ماذن وهي:\n\nمئذنه باب المغاربه/ المئذنه الفخاريه\n\nتعتبر مئذنه المغاربه وتسمى ايضا المئذنه الفخاريه اول مئذنه تشيد في المسجد في عام 1278م، وتقع على الزاويه الجنوبيه الغربيه من المسجد الاقصى، وهي قريبه من باب المغاربه وتحديدا فوق الطرف الشمالي الغربي لجامع النساء الواقع داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك، بناء على اوامر من السلطان المملوكي لاجين. وسميت بالفخاريه نسبه الى فخر الدين الخليلي، والد القاضي شرف الدين عبد الرحمن الذي اشرف على بناء المبنى. وتم بناء المئذنه على الطراز السوري التقليدي، مع وجود قاعده مربعه الشكل وعامود، مقسوم الى ثلاثه طوابق ويقع فوق الطابقين الاولين شرفه المؤذن. ويحيط الشرفه غرفه مربعه التي تنتهي بدورها الى قبه حجريه مغطاه بالرصاص.\n\nمئذنه باب الغوانمه\nوتعتبر مئذنه الغوانمه المئذنه الثانيه التي تشيد في المسجد، وقد بناها المهندس المعماري القاضي شرف الدين الخليلي مابين 1297–98م،  وهي ايضا بناء على الاوامر من بناء على اوامر من السلطان المملوكي لاجين، وتقع في الركن الشمالي الغربي من الحرم القدسي الشريف بالقرب من باب الغوانمه . وتتكون من سته طوابق عاليه ونوازل، وهي اطول مئذنه في الحرم القدسي. وبرج المئذنه كلياً هو مصنوع من الحجر تقريبا، بصرف النظر عن القبه الخشبيه التي تقع على شرفه المؤذن، وبقيت مئذنه باب الغوانمه تقريبا بمناى عن الهزات الارضيه بسبب هيكلها الراسخ. والمئذنه تنقسم الى عده طوابق مشكله من الحجاره .ويعتبر الطابقين الاولين اوسع من بقيه الطوابق، ويشكلا قاعده البرج. ويعلو كلا من اربعه الطوابق الباقيه عمود اسطواني وقبه بصليه الشكل (منتفخه). اما الدرج فهو يقع خارج الطابقين الاول والثاني، ولكنه يصبح على شكل لولبي داخل الطابق الثالث حتى تصل الى شرفه المؤذن.\n\nمئذنه باب السلسله\n\nتعتبر مئذنه السلسله المئذنه الثالثه التي تشيد في المسجد وذلك في عام 1329 م بناء على اوامر الامير سيف الدين تنكز الناصري الحاكم المملوكي على الشام، في عهد السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون وذلك وفق ما جاء بالنقش التذكاري الموجود في الجهه الشرقيه من قاعده المئذنه:\n\nوتقع مئذنه باب السلسله على الحدود الغربيه من المسجد الاقصى شمال باب السلسله وتسمى ايضا بمناره المحكمه. وربما تكون هذه المئذنه حلت محل المئذنه الامويه في وقت سابق، ومبنى البرج هو مربع الشكل ومصنوع بالكامل من الحجاره. ومنذ القرن 16، فقد كان التقليد المتبع هو اختيار افضل مؤذن في المدينه وتم تعيينه في هذه المئذنه للنداء الى كل من الصلوات الخمس، ويتم رفع الاذان من هذه المئذنه اولا، لاعطاء الاشاره لمؤذني المساجد الاخرى في جميع انحاء القدس على ان تحذو حذوها.\n\nمئذنه باب الاسباط/ مئذنه الصلاحيه\n\nتعتبر مئذنه الاسباط المئذنه الرابعه للمسجد واخر مئذنه تشيده عليه وذلك في سنه 1367 كما انها تسمى ايضا بمئذنه الصلاحيه لكونها واقعه في جهه المدرسه الصلاحيه الواقعه خارج المسجد الاقصى المبارك،  وتقع هذه المئذنه في الجهه الشماليه للحرم القدسي الشريف، بين باب حطه وباب الاسباط، وقد بُنِيَت بامر من الامير سيف الدين قطلوبغا وهو ناظر الحرمين الشريفين في عهد السلطان المملوكي الاشرف شعبان، وذلك وفقاً للنقش التذكاري الذي كان موجوداً عليها:\n\nومئذنه الاسباط هي عباره برج حجر اسطواني (بني في وقت لاحق في العهد العثمانيين) وليست مربعه الماذن الاخرى، ويبدا برج المئذنه صعودا من قاعده مستطيله تعود للعهد المملوكي. ويضيق فوق شرفه المؤذن، وتنتشر فيه نوافذ دائريه، وتنتهي بقبه بصليه الشكل (منتفخه). وقد اعيد بناء القبه بعد وقوع زلزال وادي الاردن عام 1927.\nومن الجدير للذكر انه لا وجود للماذن في الجزء الشرقي من المسجد الاقصى المبارك. ومع ذلك، اعلن عبد الله الثاني ملك الاردن في عام 2006 عن نيته لبناء المئذنه الخامسه لتطل على جبل الزيتون. ومن المقرر ان تحمل المئذنه اسم حسين ملك الاردن كما انها سيكون اطول مبنى في البلده القديمه من القدس.\n\nابواب المسجد الاقصى\nيحتوي المسجد الاقصى على خمسه عشر باب منها ما هو مستعمل (مفتوح) في ايامنا هذه وعددها عشره، والبقيه مغلقه منذ زمن بعيد لاسباب عديده،: وتقع جميع الابواب المفتوحه في الجهه الشماليه والغربيه من المسجد، وهي في الوقت نفسه تقع ضمن اسوار المسجد الاقصى.\nابواب المسجد الاقصى تشترك جميعها في انها ابواب خشبيه مكونه من دفه او دفتين، وتشتمل على خوخه «فتحه» لتنظيم المرور استعملت لمرور المتاخرين بعد اغلاق الابواب عند الغروب.\nوقد برع المسلمون في الاعمال الخشبيه وتفننوا في زخرفتها واظهار تفصيلاتها والعنايه بدقائقها كالمزاليج والمفاتيح والمفاصل وغيرها من الامور التي تؤكد.\n\nالابواب المفتوحه\nباب الاسباط/ باب الاُسود\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه ويسمى ايضا باب الاًسود نسبه للاسدين المنحوتين على جانبي الباب ، ويقع في الزاويه الشماليه الشرقيه للمسجد الاقصى، ويعود تاريخ تجديد بنائه الى الفتره الايوبيه، كما تم تجديد الباب في الفتره المملوكيه في 1367م.\nوالواجهه الجنوبيه لهذا الباب هي مدخل بارتفاع 4 امتار تقريباً وفتحه مستطيله بعقد مدبب، وفي زاويه المدخل توجد دركاه مربعه الشكل تعد جزءاً من الرواق الشمالي، وللباب دفتان من الخشب يبدو انهما حديثتا العهد، ويوجد في احد الدفتين خوخه (مدخل صغير) تسمح بدخول شخص واحد فقط، ويعد مدخل الدركاه احد اقواس الرواق الشمالي الضخمه المدببه. اما الواجهه الشماليه للباب فهي فتحه مستطيله لقوس مدبب عرضه 2 متر تقريباً وارتفاعه 4 امتار كما ان المدخل مسقوف بقنطره مدببه عرضها حوالي 1 متر.\n\nباب حطه\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه، ويقع في الواجهه الشماليه للمسجد الاقصى وتحديدا ضمن الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الشمالي. وقد تم تجديده عام 1220م في الفتره الايوبيه في عهد شرف الدين ابو المنصور عيسى الايوبي. وتتكون واجهته الجنوبيه التي تقع داخل المسجد من باب مستطيل ذي عقد حجري موتور، وعليه باب خشبي من دفتين، في احداها خوخه صغيره، ويتقدمه دركاه وهي جزء من الرواق الشمالي ايضا مدخلها عباره عن عقد حجري مدبب يعلوه صف من الكوابل الحجريه عددها تسعه كوابل، يزداد قطرها كلما ارتفعنا لاعلى الباب، وبين فتحه الباب وهذه الكوابل يوجد ثلاثه زخارف دائريه بارزه على مركز الفتحه واطرافها.\n\nباب العتم\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه ويسمى ايضا باب فيصل نسبه الى الملك فيصل الاول. وقد جدد بناء هذا الباب في الفتره الايوبيه، في ايام الملك المعظم ابن الملك العادل ابو بكر بن ايوب سنه 1213، وذلك عند تجديد الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى. كما انه يعرف ولهذا الباب عده اسماء فهو باب الدودداريه، وباب الملك فيصل، وباب شرف الانبياء.\nوتتكون واجهه الباب الجنوبيه من فتحه ارتفاعها 4 امتار، وعليها باب خشبي من دفتين يتقدمه من الجهه الجنوبيه دركاه تعد جزءاً من الرواق الشمالي، وهي مغطاه بعقد صليبي ومدخل الدركاه عباره عن قوس مدبب ضخم، وهو يقع ضمن سلسله اقواس الرواق الشمالي\n\nباب الغوانمه/باب الوليد\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه، ويعتبر اول باب يشيد في الجدار الغربي ابتداء من الناحيه الشماليه، وقد انشئ في العهد الاموي، وعرف انذاك باسم باب الوليد نسبه الى الوليد بن عبد الملك، وقد جدد الباب عام 1307م وذلك عند انشاء الرواق الغربي للمسجد في عهد قلاوون، والباب مستطيل الشكل نسبه عرضه الى ارتفاعه لباقي ابواب المسجد تعد قليله، وعلى المدخل باب خشبي من دفه واحده من الخشب يوجد به خوخه صغيره لتمييزها من الباب ويتقدم الباب من الجهه الشرقيه دهليز معقود بعقد برميلي واجهته عقد حجري مدبب، يرقى للباب بواسطه ثماني درجات عن ساحه المسجد الاقصى المبلطه، وبجانب الباب عقد مدبب اخر لكنه مغلق.\n\nباب الناظر\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه، يقع في الجدار الغربي لساحه المسجد الاقصى، وقد جدد بناؤه في الفتره الايوبيه سنه 1203م في عهد الملك المعظم عيسى بن احمد، وله عده اسماء اخرى متداوله مثل باب الحبس لقربه من الحبس ايام العثمانيين، وباب المجلس .\nويتقدم الباب من الجهه الشرقيه دركاه مربعه تقع ضمن امتداد الرواق الغربي، وتغطيها قبه مرفوعه على ثلاثه صفوف من المقرنصات، اما فتحه الباب فهي عباره عن مستطيل ضخم ارتفاعه 4,5 متر وعرضه 2 متر، ويعلو الفتحه المستطيله قوس موتور تعلوه زخرفه على شكل رواق صغير، وتنفصل مساحه الدركاه عن بقيه الرواق باقواس مدببه. وعلى الدعامه التي تقع على عقد المدخل المدبب والعقد المجاور له من عقود الرواق يوجد نقش حجري، ويبين النقش تاريخ البناء والسلطان الذي جدد في عهده. ويتقدم الباب قنطره مغطاه بقبو متقاطع يؤدي الى طريق باب الناظر المؤديه الى طريق الواد. وفي الجهه الجنوبيه من القنطره مدخل يؤدي بواسطه درج حجري، وفي الجهه الشماليه مدخل المدرسه المنجكيه.\n\nباب الحديد\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه، ويقع في الواجهه الغربيه للمسجد الاقصى، وهو احد المداخل المتفرعه عن طريق باب العمود. وقد سمي بهذا الاسم نسبه الى الامير ارغون الذي يعني باللغه التركيه الـحديد، وقد جدد في عهده بين سنتي 755هـــ و758هـــ/1354-1357م، والباب عباره عن فتحه مستطيله بعقد، ويتقدمه من الواجهه الشرقيه دركاه مغطاه بقبو متقاطع، وباب الحديد على شكل قوس حذوي مدبب على جانبيه مداميك حجريه بارتفاع 60 سم تقريبا، ويعلو الباب واجهه تعود للفتره المملوكيه، وتتوسط هذه الواجهه نافذه معقوده بعقد مدبب زخرف بخطوط متعرجه.\n\nباب القطانين\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه، ويقع في الجهه الغربيه لساحه المسجد الاقصى، ويعد من الابواب الرئيسيه الهامه والجميله المؤديه للمسجد، ويؤدي هذا الباب الى سوق القطانين ومنه جاءت تسميته، وقد جدد هذا الباب في عهد السلطان قلاوون على يد الامير سيف الدين تنكز عام 1336م، وهذا واضح من خلال نقش يوجد في اعلى المدخل من الجهه الشرقيه المطله على ساحه الحرم القدسي، وقد ازيلت على يد المجلس الاسلامي الاعلى سنه 1922م. والواجهه الشماليه للباب مكونه من قوصره مدخل تنخفض عن مستوى الساحه بتسع درجات تحيط بها من ثلاث جهات، وهذه القوصره واسعه حيث يبلغ عرضها 7 امتار تقريباً وارتفاعها 13 متر، وهي مغطاه بنصف قبه من الحجر. واما المفتاح فهو اسود اللون ونصف القبه مقامه على خمسه صفوف من المقرنصات، وفتحه الباب مستطيله بارتفاع 4 امتار وعرض 2,5 متر ويعلو الباب عتب حجري مستقيم وهو مكون من ثلاث قطع خارجيه.\n\nباب المطهره\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه، ويقع في الواجهه الغربيه لساحه المسجد الاقصى، ويؤدي الى المتوضا (مكان الوضوء)، ولذلك سمي بباب المطهره، وقد جدد في العهد المملوكي سنه 1266م، على يد الامير ادغيدي، وهناك من يرى انه جدد سنه 1267م على يد الامير علاء الدين البصيري، وتتكون الواجهه الغربيه للباب من عقد حجري مدبب، وهو يخلو من اي عنصر معماري مزخرف، وعليه باب خشبي من دفتين في احداها خوخه صغيره والباب بارتفاع 3,5 متر تقريبا، وعرضه 2 متر، اما الجهه الشرقيه من الباب فهو فتحه مستطيله في عقد حجري موتور عليه مدماكان من الحجر، ويتقدمه دركاه مغطاه بقبو متقاطع، وهي جزء من الرواق الغربي.\n\nباب السلسله والسكينه/باب النبي داود\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه ويسمى ايضا باب النبي داود، ويقع في الواجهه الغربيه من ساحه المسجد الاقصى ضمن الرواق الغربي، ويعد من الابواب الرئيسيه المؤديه الى المسجد الاقصى، وهناك من يعتبرهما بابين منفصلين وليس باباً واحداً بمدخلين. اما الباب الاول والمسمى بباب السلسله، فهو مفتوح ويؤمه الزائرون للمسجد الاقصى، وقد سمي بهذا الاسم للاعتقاد بوجود سلسله كانت معلقه فيه او ربما لوجود علاقه ما تربطه بقبه السلسله، اما الاخر فهو باب السكينه، وهو يقع شمال باب السلسله، وهو ملاصق له، والباب لا يفتح الا في حالات الطوارئ والضروره القصوى، وقد جدد هذان البابان في الفتره الايوبيه سنه 1203م، في عهد السلطان الملك العادل سيف الدين ابو بكر، وهناك من يرى انه في عهد الملك المعظم عيسى، ويتكون المدخل من بابين متسعين بارتفاع 4,5 متر وعرض 2 متر والفتحه مستطيله بقوس موتور عليه باب خشبي من دفتين، في احداهما خوخه صغيره لتنظيم المرور الى المسجد الاقصى.\n\nباب المغاربه\n\nهو احدى ابواب المسجد الاقصى المفتوحه، ويقع في الزاويه الغربيه الجنوبيه لساحه المسجد الاقصى، وسمي بباب المغاربه لانه يوصل الى حاره المغاربه غرب الاقصى، ويعرف ايضا بباب البراق، وباب النبي، حيث يعتقد ان الرسول محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم دخل منه الى المسجد الاقصى المبارك ليله الاسراء والمعراج، كما يعتقد بعض المؤرخين ان عمر بن الخطاب دخل منه الى الاقصى ايضا بعد الفتح، حيث اورد ابن كثير: \n\nوقد اعيد بناؤه في الفتره المملوكيه في عهد السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون الذي قام بانشاء الاروقه الغربيه ما بين سنه 1305م- 1336م،  والباب من الواجهه الغربيه معقود بعقد مدبب بسيط التكوين. اما الجهه الشرقيه فهو عباره عن فتحه مستطيله ، وهو على شكل قوس موتور عليه باب خشبي بدفه واحده، ويفضي من الجهه الشرقيه الى دركاه تقع ضمن امتداد الرواق، وهي مؤلفه من عقدين حجريين، وتقوم على ثلاث دعامات، وعلى مركز الدعامه الوسطى زخرفه حجريه بشكل مربع في وسطه دائره، ويغطيها قبوان متقاطعان، ويجاور الباب من الجهه الشماليه مسجد صغير يسمى مسجد البراق.\n\nالابواب المغلقه\nالباب المنفرد\nهو احد المداخل الجنوبيه المغلقه في الجزء الجنوبي الشرقي من سور مدينه القدس والمسجد الاقصى المبارك، وقد اغلق بطريقه متقنه للغايه حتى لا يظهر للباب اي اثر من داخل اسوار المسجد، وقد سمي بباب الوحيد المفرد والمغلق الذي يظهر للعيان، وقد اشتهر عند المؤرخين العرب باسم باب العين لانه يؤدي الى عين سلوان.\n\nالباب الثلاثي\n\nوهو احدى ابواب المسجد المغلقه، وهو عباره عن ثلاث بوابات متجاوره تقع في الجدار الجنوبي من سور المسجد الاقصى على بعد 50 متراً من البوابه المفرده، و80 متراً من البوابه المزدوجه. وهذه البوابات شامخه العلو بجوار بعضها البعض، اتساع كلٍ منها 13 قدماً، وقد اشتهرت عند المؤرخين والكتّاب العرب باسم بوابات محراب مريم او باب محراب مريم، وهذا الباب قديم العهد يعود الى عصر ادريانوس باني القدس سنه 135م، وهو مغلق منذ اوائل القرن التاسع عشر ميلادي.\n\nالباب المزدوج\nوهو احدى ابواب المسجد المغلقه، وهو باب بمدخلين مزدوجين مغلقين، يقع في الجهه الجنوبيه من سور الجامع الاقصى خلف منبر الامام تماماً حيث يؤدي الى اسفل الجامع الاقصى عبر ممداخل مائله، ويبعد عن الباب الثلاثي مسافه 80 متراً. وهو باب قديم جداً يعود تاريخه الى البيزنطيين، ومن اسماء هذا الباب: بوابه خلده، بوابه الاقصى القديمه، وبوابه النبي.\n\nالباب الذهبي (باب الرحمه والتوبه)\n\nوهو احدى ابواب المسجد المغلقه، ويكاد ان يكون الباب الوحيد في الجهه الشرقيه الشماليه للسور لولا وجود باب صغير يسمى باب الجنائز، وهناك من يرى ان الباب الذهبي اسس قبل الفتح الاسلامي للمدينه، الا انه لم يبق من ذلك البناء سوى الموقع، وربما لمسات من التصميم العام، وقد اعيد بناؤه مرات عديده بعد ذلك، منها ما كان بعد جلاء الفرس عن القدس ودخول الامبراطور هرقل، واما البناء الاخير فقد تم في العصر الاموي، والباب الذهبي في حقيقه الامر مكون من بابين الرحمه والتوبه، اما اغلاقهما فيرجح انهما اغلقا في عهد صلاح الدين الايوبي بعد اخراجه الصليبيين من القدس، وذلك لاسباب امنيه، وهناك من يقول انهما اغلقا بامر الخليفه عمر بن الخطاب للاسباب نفسها، ومهما يكن فان الحصيله هي ان هذه الابواب مغلقه منذ زمن ولم تفتح الى يومنا هذا. اما اسم الباب الذهبي فقد اطلقه عليه المسيحيون لاعتقادهم ان السيد المسيح سيمر من خلاله عند رجوعه، وهم يؤمنون بانه كان قد دخل منه فعلاً في احد الشعانين.\n\nباب الجنائز\nوهو احدى ابواب المسجد المغلقه، يقع في السور الشرقي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك يؤدي الى المقبره المجاوره بعد الصلاه عليها في المسجد الاقصى، وهو باب صغير لا يستخدم حاليا. تظهر اثاره من خلف الخزائن الحديديه التي يستعملها حراس باب الاسباط في المكان، لكن المرجح انه كان يقع جنوبي باب الرحمه. وعلى اي حال، فيحتمل ان يكون قد وجد في التاريخ بابان بهذا الاسم، حيث يمكن ان يكون الباب قديماً كان جنوب باب الرحمه، ومن ثم تحول في فترات متاخره (على الاصح الفتره العثمانيه) الى قرب باب الاسباط.\nكان هذا الباب يستخدم لاخراج الجنائز من المسجد الاقصى المبارك الى مقبره الرحمه المحاذيه للسور الشرقي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك، واغلق على الارجح بامر من السلطان صلاح الدين الايوبي بعد تحرير القدس في 583هـ - 1187م، لحمايه المسجد والمدينه من اي غزو محتمل.\n\nالمساطب\nالاروقه\nيحتوي المسجد الاقصى على رواقان يمتدان من جهته الشماليه والغربيه وهما\n\nالرواق الغربي\nوهو ممر مسقوف يتكون من 55 عقدا، ويمتد بطول الواجهه الغربيه للمسجد الاقصى، بنى على عده مراحل في العهد المملوكي، وتحديدا ما بين عامي 1307 و1336م بهدف تسهيل المرور بين كافه المعالم الموجوده في المنطقه الغربيه للمسجد المبارك.\n\nالرواق الشمالي\nهو ممر مسقوف بطول الواجهه الشماليه للمسجد الاقصى، وقد بني على عده مراحل في العهدين الايوبي والمملوكي، وتحديدا ما بين عامي 1213 و1367م، بهدف تسهيل المرور بين كافه المعالم الموجوده في المنطقه الشماليه للمسجد.\nواليوم يتكون الرواق من عده مدارس، ولم يتبق اي جزء منه.\n\nالمدارس\nتتميز بيوت العباده في الاسلام بكونها دور عباده وعلم في انٍ واحد، حيث نجد ان الكثير من المساجد تعتبر جامعا وجامعه في ان واحد. ولذا حرص المسلمون منذ العصور الاسلاميه المبكره على اقامه المدارس في المسجد الاقصى المبارك، ووقفها على الشيوخ والطلاب الذين يرابطون في هذا الموضع الشريف طلبا للعلم والثواب. وتنتشر مدارس المسجد الاقصى المبارك في الرواقين الشمالي والغربي للمسجد، وبعضها يمتد خارج سور المسجد المبارك ملاصقا له، وكلها تعتبر جزءا لا يتجزا من الاقصى الشريف، ونذكر منها \n\nمدارس ورياض الاقصى الاسلاميه\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع هذه المدارس داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك، بين بابي حطه وفيصل. انشئت في مطلع الثمانينات من القرن العشرين. ولها فروع عديده بعضها خارج المسجد الاقصى المبارك.\n\nالمدرسه البكريه/الدواداريه\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع على الحد الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك من الخارج الى الشمال من مدارس ورياض الاقصى الاسلاميه، وهي مدرسه كبيره من مدارس البلده القديمه، وتمتد غربا حتى المدرسه العمريه، وكانت تعرف حتى اواسط القرن العشرين باسم «المدرسه الدواداريه»، نسبه لبانيها الامير علم الدين سنجر الدوادار، سنه 695هـ -1295م.\nوقد ظلت المدرسه البكريه تستعمل كمدرسه اكاديميه ابتدائيه حتى مجيء الاحتلال الصهيوني حيث حول الجزء الاكبر منها الى مدرسه للمعاقين تخضع لاداره دائره المعارف التابعه لبلديه القدس المحتله منذ عام 1967م.\nثانويه الاقصى الشرعيه\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك، غلب عليها هذا الاسم لانها كانت عند انشائها في مطلع الثمانينيات من القرن العشرين ثانويه محضه، واليوم هي عباره عن مدرسه اعداديه وثانويه لطلبه الفرع الشرعي من الذكور.\n\nالمدرسه الغادريه\n\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك. يعود تاريخ تشييدها الى عهد السلطان المملوكي برسباي عام 1432م على يد مصر خاتون زوجه الامير ناصر الدين بن دلغادر، ومنه جاءت تسميتها.\nتم تجديدها من قبل دائره الاوقاف الاسلاميه، لكن سلطات الاحتلال منعت تتمه السقف، ولا زالت بلا سقف حتى اليوم.\nوالحقيقه ان هذا هو حال معظم مدارس الاقصى اليوم، التي اهملت بسبب مزاعم الصهاينه انها تحوي اثارا يهوديه، مما ادى الى اهمال الكثير من المدارس القديمه واغلاقها، او تاجيرها للسكنى.\n\nالمدرسه الباسطيه\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع فوق مدارس ورياض الاقصى الاسلاميه الواقعه داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك بين بابي حطه والعتم. ويعتبر شمس الدين محمد الهروي شيخ الصلاحيه وناظر الحرمين في العهد المملوكي اول من بدا بتشييدها، ولكن ادركته المنيه قبل عمارتها، فعمرها القاضي زين الدين عبد الباسط بن خليل الدمشقي، سنه 835هـ -1431م، وحملت المدرسه اسمه.\nوقد كانت المدرسه الباسطيه مدرسه عظيمه اشتهرت في ارجاء العالم الاسلامي، حيث تخرج منها العديد من العلماء ودرس فيها العديد من الحفاظ ورواه الحديث والاطباء وعلماء الفلك والرياضيات. وهي اليوم عباره عن قسمين: واحد ماهول بجماعه من ال جار الله، والاخر يستعمل مقرا للمدرسه البكريه.\n\nالمدرسه الامينيه\n\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع غربي باب العتم في السور الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى، ويحدها من الشرق الطريق الداخل الى باب العتم، ومن الشمال طريق المجاهدين، ومن الغرب المدرسه الفارسيه، ومن الجنوب ساحه المسجد الاقصى المبارك. وهي مؤلفه من اربعه طوابق. وتسمى ايضا دار الامام، حيث درّس فيها اجداد عائله الامام واتخذت دارا لسكناهم.\nويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى عام 730هـ -1329م في العهد المملوكي على يد الوزير امين الدين عبد الله بن غانم، الذي كان احد المسؤولين في جيش الناصر محمد بن قلاوون ويعرف بامين الملك، فعرفت باسمه، وقد جرى ترميمها في العهد العثماني.\nوتعتبر هذه المدرسه من اجمل المدارس المطله على ساحات المسجد الاقصى، ومن اهمها\n\nالمدرسه الملكيه\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع في الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك بين المدرسه الفارسيه شرقا، والمدرسه الاسعرديه غربا، ومدخلها مشترك مع الاسعرديه. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى عام 741هـ - 1340م، في عهد السلطان المملوكي الناصر محمد بن قلاوون، واوقفها الحاج ال الملك الجوكندار، بعد بنائها باربع سنوات. والمدرسه تحمل معظم العناصر المعماريه المميزه للعهد المملوكي، وخاصه تبادل الوان الحجاره التي بنيت بها بين الاحمر والابيض.\nوالمدرسه عباره عن طابقين، ماهوله حاليا على سبيل السكنى من قبل عائله الدجاني، اذ استاجروها من دائره الاوقاف الاسلاميه.\n\nالمدرسه الاسعرديه\n\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع داخل الرواق الشمالي للمسجد الاقصى، اوقفها التاجر مجد الدين الاسعردي عام 770هـ - 1368م، فعرفت باسمه.\nوهذه المدرسه واسعه تتكون من طابقين يتوسطهما صحن مكشوف مربع الشكل، ويحيط بالصحن عدد من الخلاوي الصغيره ذات المداخل المعقوده. تتميز بوجود ثلاث قباب فوقها من جهاتها الشرقيه والوسطى والغربيه،\nوقد قام المجلس الاسلامي الاعلى في عهد الاحتلال البريطاني بترميمها، ونقل اليها دار كتب المسجد الاقصى قبل ان تتحول الى دار لسكنى ال البيطار حاليا.\n\nالمدرسه المنجكيه\n\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع فوق باب الناظر في الرواق الغربي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك، ويقع فوقها قبه، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى العهد المملوكي في عام 763هـ - 1361م على يد الامير يوسف الدين منجك. وهي عباره عن طابقين يصعد اليهما بدرجات.\nوالمدرسه تستخدم اليوم كمقر لدائره الاوقاف الاسلاميه العامه بالقدس، التابعه لوزاره الاوقاف الاردنيه، والمكلفه اداره شئون المسجد الاقصى المبارك.\n\nالمدرسه العثمانيه\n\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع على السور الغربي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك جنوبي باب المطهره، اوقفتها اصفهان شاه خاتون بنت محمود العثمانيه سنه 840هـ-1437م، في عهد السلطان الاشرف برسباي.\nوالمدرسه العثمانيه عباره عن طابقين جلهما خارج المسجد الاقصى، ومسجد المدرسه بمستوى ساحات المسجد الاقصى ويطل عليها، وقد استولى عليه اليهود واغلقوا شباكه بالحجاره. اما المدرسه فتستخدم حاليا لسكنى العائلات المسلمه.\n\nالمدرسه الاشرفيه\n\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع في الجهه الغربيه من المسجد الاقصى المبارك، بين المدرسه العثمانيه شمالا ومئذنه باب السلسله جنوبا. وتسمى ايضا السلطانيه، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى العهد المملوكي عام 875هـ -1470م، على يد الامير حسن الظاهري لكن البناء لم يعجب السلطان الاشرف قايتباي عندما راه اثناء زيارته للقدس، فامر بهدمها، واعيد بناءها عام 885/884هـ - 1480/1479م.\n\nوالمدرسه تنقسم الى قسمان: حيث يقع القسم الاول داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك، والاخر خارجه، والذي داخله عباره عن طابقين: الاول كان مصلى الحنابله في المسجد الاقصى المبارك في اصله، ويستخدم جزء منه الان كمقر لقسم المخطوطات التابع لمكتبه المسجد الاقصى المبارك ومقرها الرئيسي في جامع النساء، والجزء الاكبر منه هو مقر ثانويه الاقصى الشرعيه للبنات، وفيه ايضا قبر الشيخ الخليلي، وبعض الاجزاء الصغيره التي تستخدم دوراً للسكن.\nاما الطابق الثاني، فمتهدم السقف، وهو مسجد المدرسه. ويرجع انهدام هذا الجزء لزلزال وقع في عام 1346هـ - 1927م.\n\nومبنى المدرسه جميل البناء، حيث اشتملت عناصره على صفوف الحجاره المشهره الملونه باللونين الاحمر والابيض، وامتازت بغناها بالعناصر المعماريه والزخرفيه. وصفها مجير الدين الحنبلي بانها \nالمدرسه التنكزيه\n\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتقع بين باب السلسله شمالا وحائط البراق المحتل جنوبا، ويقع جزء منها داخل الرواق الغربي للمسجد الاقصى.\nويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى العهد المملوكي عام 729هـ -1328م على يد نائب الشام الامير سيف الدين تنكز، ونسبت اليه.\nوقد كانت مدرسه عظيمه وداراً للحديث، وفي عهد السلطان المملوكي قايتباي، اتخذت مقراً للقضاء والحكم. وفي العهد العثماني، تحولت المدرسه الى محكمه شرعيه، ومن هنا صارت تعرف باسم المحكمه، وبقيت كذلك حتى اوائل عهد الانتداب البريطاني، فاتخذها المجلس الاسلامي الاعلى دارا للسكنى، ثم عادت بعد ذلك مدرسه لتعليم الفقه الاسلامي.\nوفي عام 1389هـ -1969م، صادرتها سلطات الاحتلال الصهيوني، ثم حولتها الى موقع عسكري لما يعرف بحرس الحدود، حيث يشرفون منها على المسجد الاقصى، ويتدخلون لملاحقه المصلين عند اندلاع المظاهرات المندده بالاحتلال.\n\nالمدرسه العمريه (المحدثيه- الصبيبيه- الجاوليه)\n\nهي احدى مدارس المسجد الاقصى، وتطل على الحد الشمالي الغربي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك، وتعتبر جزءا منه. وهي مدرسه تاريخيه كبيره وواسعه تبلغ مساحتها 4 دونمات، وتتكون من ثلاثه مدارس مملوكيه سابقه:\n\nالمحدثيه\nالصبيبيه\nالجاوليه\nبالاضافه الى عدد من الغرف والزوايا المختلفه التي كانت قائمه في عهود سابقه. وكانت المدرستان الاخيرتان قد استعملتا سكنا لنواب القدس، ومقرا للحكم العثماني، ثم مدرسه باسم روضه المعارف، ثم مقرا لشرطه الاحتلال البريطاني، ثم اتخذها المجاهدون مقراً للجهاد المقدس، ثم مقرا لقائد القدس الاردني، ثم مدرسه.\nوقد استولى عليها الصهاينه عام 1967م بعد احتلال القدس والمسجد الاقصى.\n\nالبوائك\nالبوائك وتسمى ايضا القناطر والموازين، وهي عباره عن اعمده تربطها عقود، وتقع اعلى الدرجات الحجريه التي تقود الى صحن الصخره المشرفه التي تقع في قلب المسجد الاقصى المبارك. وقد انشئت هذه البوائك لاغراض جماليه، فوق الدرجات التي تقود الى صحن الصخره والتي تسهل ايضا انتقال المصلين بين مختلف جهات المسجد الاقصى دون الحاجه الى الالتفاف حول الصحن.\nويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى بدايه العهد الاسلامي للاقصى خاصه العهد المملوكي الذي يعتبر من ازهى العهود التي مرت بالاقصى المبارك، وجددت في العهد العثماني. وهي 8 بوائك\n\nالبائكه الشماليه\nهي احدى بوائك الاقصى، وتقع في منتصف الركن الشمالي لصحن الصخره، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى العهد المملوكي عام 721هـ - 1321م، ويبلغ ارتفاعها 7.5 امتار.\nوهي عباره عن ركبتين عظيمتين في الاطراف، وعمودين اسطوانيين في الوسط، وسلمها الحجري يقوم على مرحله واحده وهو من تسع درجات.\n\nالبائكه الشماليه الغربيه\n\nهي احدى بوائك الاقصى، وتقع على الطرف الغربي لصحن الصخره في جهته الشماليه، بالقرب من قبه الخضر. يعود تاريخ تشييدها الى العهد المملوكي عام 778هـ/1376م،\nثم جددت في العهد العثماني، ويبلغ ارتفاعها 7 امتار.\nوالبائكه عباره عن ركبتين عظيمتين في الاطراف، وثلاثه اعمده اسطوانيه في الوسط، سلمها الحجري تبلغ عدد درجاته ثلاثا وعشرين درجه.\n\nالبائكه الغربيه\n\nهي احدى بوائك الاقصى، وتقع في منتصف الحد الغربي لصحن الصخره المشرفه الواقعه في قلب المسجد الاقصى المبارك. يعود تاريخ تشييدها المعروف حالياً الى عام 340هـ/951م.\nوهي عباره عن ركبتين عظيمتين في الاطراف، وثلاثه اعمده اسطوانيه في الوسط، سلمها تبلغ درجاته اربعا وعشرين درجه، توصل الصاعد الى صحن الصخره من ساحه المسجد الغربيه.\n\nالبائكه الجنوبيه الغربيه\n\nهي احدى بوائك الاقصى، وتقع على المحيط الغربي لصحن قبه الصخره في جهته الجنوبيه، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى 877هـ/1472م.\nوهي عباره عن ركبتين عظيمتين في الاطراف، وعمودين من الرخام في الوسط، ويبلغ ارتفاعها 7 امتار، ويوصل اليها سلم حجري، من اربع وعشرين درجه.\n\nالبائكه الجنوبيه\n\nهي احدى بوائك الاقصى، وتقع في منتصف الركن الجنوبي لصحن الصخره، يُعْتَقَدُ انها انشئت في العهد الاموي، ولكن من المؤكد انها جددت في العهد العباسي، ثم الفاطمي والعثماني، ثم رممتها دائره الاوقاف الاسلاميه عام 1402هـ/1982م.\nوهي عباره عن ثلاثه اعمده اسطوانيه وسطى، تحفها ركبتان عظيمتان عن يمين وعن شِمال، يبلغ ارتفاعها سته امتار ونصف المتر. ويصل ساحه المسجد بصحن الصخره درج حجري من عشرين درجه.\nوفي الواجهه الجنوبيه من هذه البائكه الجنوبيه، توجد مزوله شمسيه يستعين بها المصلون للتعرف على اوقات الصلوات، وهي من صنع مهندس المجلس الاسلامي الاعلى رشدي الامام سنه 1907م.\n\nالبائكه الجنوبيه الشرقيه\n\nهي احدى بوائك الاقصى، وتقع قرب الطرف الشرقي للحد الجنوبي لصحن الصخره. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى العهد الفاطمي عام 412هـ/1021م، وتم تجديدها في العهد الايوبي عام 608هـ/1211م.\nوالبائكه عباره عن ركبتين عظيمتين في الاطراف، وعمودي رخام اسطواني الشكل في الوسط، وعدد درجات سلمها الحجري تسع عشره، ويتراوح ارتفاعها بين 6.5 متر و7 امتار.\n\nالبائكه الشرقيه\n\nهي احدى بوائك الاقصى، وتقع في الركن الشرقي لصحن الصخره، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها على الارجح في العهد الاموي، واعيد بناؤها في العصر العباسي في القرن العاشر الميلادي\nوتعد اكبر البوائك حول صحن الصخره، حيث تتكون من ركبتين عظيمتين، واربعه اعمده اسطوانيه رخاميه الصناعه. ويصل ساحه المسجد الشرقيه بصحن الصخره اثنتان وعشرون درجه، وثلاث درجات اخريات، ويبلغ ارتفاعها 6.5 متر.\n\nالبائكه الشماليه الشرقيه\n\nهي احدى بوائك الاقصى، وتقع في الجانب الشمالي من سطح قبه الصخره من ناحيه الشرق، تتصل بمحور مستقيم عبر ممر مبلط بباب حطه. ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى العهد المملوكي عام 726هـ/1325م في عهد السلطان الناصر ناصر الدين محمد بن قلاوون، وقد وثق ذلك بنقش على الواجهه الجنوبيه للبائكه.\n\nالاسبله\nحرص المسلمون حرصاً شديداً على توفير المياه للشرب والطهور في المسجد الاقصى المبارك، فحُفرت الابار، وتم انشاء الصهاريج والاسبله داخله في الساحات المكشوفه، لتخزين مياه الامطار. والسبيل عين ماء وما لحقها، وقد زودت بصنابير للمياه وثلاجات لدى تجديدها في العصر الحديث.\nويعود انشاء هذه الاسبله الى العصرين الايوبي والمملوكي، كما ان كثيرا منها استحدث او جدد في العصر العثماني بامر السلطان سليمان القانوني الذي تميز عهده ببناء الاسبله. وللاقصى اسبله كثيره نذكر منها 14 التاليه:\n\nسبيل الكاس\n\nيقع هذا السبيل المشهور امام المصلى القبلي، قيل انه من بناء العباسيين في الاصل، ولكن البناء الحالي تم في عهد السلطان الايوبي العادل ابو بكر بن ايوب عام 589هـ/1193م، وقد جدده المماليك وقاموا بتوسعته في عهد الامير سيف الدين تنكز عام 1327-1328م، لاستيعاب المزيد من المصلين. على الرغم من توفير المياه اصلا من مياه بركه سليمان بالقرب من بيت لحم، اما حاليا فيتلقى المياه من الانابيب المرتبطه بشبكه مياه القدس. وقد سمي بهذا الاسم لشكله الشبيه بالكاس، ويسمى ايضا بسبيل البركه\nوالكاس بركه اسطوانيه الشكل، وفي وسطها كاس مرتفعه، تتوسطها ماسوره مياه، تتدفق المياه منها الى الحوض، فتصب من الكاس للبركه، بشكل جميل. ويستعمل الناس مياه الكاس للوضوء خاصه، على كراسٍ حجريه الصنع ذات الوان جميله، وامام كل منها حنفيه مربوطه بالبركه، وهي عشرون حنفيه.\n\nسبيل شعلان\nيقع هذا السبيل شمالي درج البائكه الشماليه الغربيه التي تقود الى صحن قبه الصخره، ويعود تاريخ تشييده الى عام 1216م في عهد السلطان الايوبي الملك المعظم عيسى، وجدد في العهد المملوكي على يد الملك الاشرف بربساي عام 1429م، وجدد مره اخرى سنه 1037هـ/1627م على يد بيرام باشا محافظ مصر، في عهد محافظ القدس محمد باشا في العصر العثماني، وقد كان السبيل عامرا حتى اخر عهد الاحتلال البريطاني، واما اليوم فهو معطل.\n\nصهريج المعظم عيسى الايوبي\nوهو مبنى يقوم في الساحات الغربيه للمسجد الاقصى المبارك، بين البائكتين: البائكه الغربيه والبائكه الجنوبيه الغربيه اسفل صحن الصخره، امام باب القطانين. ويعود تاريخ تشييده الى عام 607هـ/1210م في عهد السلطان الايوبي عيسى، وسمي باسمه.\nوالبناء مؤلف من ثلاثه اروقه سفليه، فصلت بقواطع بنائيه فيما بينها، لكل منها مدخل منفصل في جهتها الغربيه. وهو يرتفع عن مستوى صحن الصخره ببناء اضيف في الفتره العثمانيه، وكان احد اروقته الثلاثه قد استخدم في عهد المماليك مخزنا لحاصلات المسجد الاقصى، واخر مصلى للحنابله، ثم اهمل فتره من الزمن، وحُول في وقت لاحق الى مخزن لحدائق المسجد، ويستعمل جزء منه حاليا كعياده طبيه مكمله للعياده الطبيه الواقعه شماله، والجزء الاكبر منه عباره عن مكاتب للاوقاف.\n\nسبيل البصيري\n\nيقع هذا السبيل شمال شرق باب الناظر داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك. ويعود تاريخ تشييده الى عام 839هـ/1436م في عهد السلطان المملوكي الاشرف برسباي، وقيل انه انشئ قبله وان بناءه تجديد فقط. ويسمى ايضا سبيل الحبس، وسبيل باب الناظر، وبئر ابراهيم الرومي.\n\nسبيل قايتباي\n\nوهو سبيل مياه شهير يقع مقابل باب المطهره، وقد بُني السبيل فوق الطرف الشماليّ الغربيّ لمصطبه واسعه تحمل نفس الاسم، ولها محراب في الجهه الجنوبيه، بناهما الملك الاشرف ابوالنصر اينال عام 860هـ، ثم جدد السبيل في عهد الملك الاشرف قايتباي عام 887هـ/1482م بعد تهدمه، وعرف باسمه، واعاد تجديده السلطان العثماني عبد المجيد الثاني عام 1330هـ/1912م.\nوالسبيل عباره عن مبنى مرتفع وجميل، دخلت فيه فنون العماره، وجملته الحجاره الملونه الداخله في بنائه، وله قبه جميله مزخرفه بزخارف نباتيه، قيل انه السبيل الوحيد من نوعه في فلسطين قاطبه.\n\nسبيل قاسم باشا\n\nيقوم هذا السبيل بين المدرسه الاشرفيه غربا، والصحن الغربي للصخره المشرفه شرقا، في الساحات الغربيه للمسجد الاقصى المبارك.\nويسمى ايضا سبيل باب المحكمه، نسبه الى باب السلسله الذي يقع بالقرب منه. بني في عهد السلطان العثماني سليمان القانوني عام 933هـ/1527م، على يد والي القدس قاسم باشا، وسمي باسمه.\nوالسبيل مثمن الشكل، تنزل اليه بدرجات، من فوقه سقف خشبي يحجب اشعه الشمس عن مستعمليه، ويقلل من ضغط الرياح القارصه ليلا والامطار النازله شتاء.\n\nسبيل سليمان القانوني\n\nيقع في الساحات الشماليه للمسجد الاقصى المبارك، بناه السلطان العثماني سليمان القانوني عام 943هـ/1536م، ومنه جاءت تسميته. ويسمى ايضا بسبيل السلسله وسبيل العتم.\n\nسبيل باب المغاربه\n\nيقع هذا السبيل شرقي باب المغاربه داخل المسجد الاقصى المبارك، وتحديدا على الطرف الجنوبي الشرقي لمصطبه مصلى البراق، ويعود تاريخ تشييده الى العهد العثماني.\n\nسبيل باب حطه\nيوجد هذا السبيل البسيط على شكل تجويف داخل الجدار الشرقي لباب حطه، ويعود تاريخ تشييده الى العهد العثماني، وقد رممته مؤسسه الاقصى لاعمار المقدسات الاسلاميه اثناء بنائها لوحده المراحيض القريبه مؤخرا، ثم اُلْغٍي نهائيا بعد ذلك.\nوالى الشرق من باب حطه.\n\nبركه النارنج\n\nوهي بركه تقع في الساحات الغربيه للمسجد الاقصى المبارك امام المدرسه الاشرفيه، بين مصطبه سبيل قايتباي شمالا، وسبيل قاسم باشا جنوبا، وتسمى ايضاً بركه عنغج، ويعود تاريخ تشييدها الى 887هـ/1482م في عهد السلطان المملوكي قايتباي، وقامت لجنه اعمار المقدسات بترميمها مؤخرا.\nوهي بركه مربعه الشكل، طول ضلعها سبعه امتار، فرشت ارضها وحيطانها بالرخام، يتوسطها صحن به نافوره معطله، ويحيط بها اربع وعشرين حنفيه من ثلاث جهات.\n\nسبيل الشيخ بدير\n\nيقع سبيل الشيخ بدير الى الجنوب الشرقي من باب الحبس، غرب البائكه الشماليه الغربيه التي تقود الى صحن قبه الصخره، وقد بني في عهد السلطان العثماني محمود الاول عام 1153هـ/1740م، باشراف مصطفى اغا قائم مقام القدس، وبامر من الوالي عثمان بيك. وتسمى ايضا سبيل

سبب تسميتها بهذا الاسم.\n\nسبيل الرحمه\nيقع السبيل غرب بابي الرحمه والتوبه، ويعود تاريخ تشييده الى 1416هـ/1995م على يد لجنه التراث الاسلامي، وهو عباره عن اثنتي عشره حنفيه عامره ومستعمله.\n\nمعالم اخرى\nيحتوي المسجد الاقصى على عده معالم اخرى نذكر منها:\n\nحائط البراق\nقسم من الحائط الغربي للمسجد الاقصى المبارك يمتد بين باب المغاربه جنوبا، والمدرسه التنكزيه شمالا، ويبلغ طوله حوالي 50 مترا، اما ارتفاعه فيقل عن 20 مترا، وقد عرف بهذا الاسم لان النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم ربط دابته البراق فيه على الارجح يوم اسرائه الى المسجد الاقصى المبارك.\n\nمنبر نور الدين الزنكي\nهو منبر تاريخي شهير يمثل روعه الفن والزخرفه الاسلاميه، بناه نور الدين زنكي عام 564هـ/1168م، ليحمل الى المسجد الاقصى بعد تحريرها من الصليبيين، لكنه مات قبل ان يحقق ذلك، فلما حرر صلاح الدين بيت المقدس، امر باحضاره من حلب، وذلك بعد اكثر من عشرين عاما من بنائه، ووضعه داخل المصلى القبلي وهو المصلى الرئيسي في المسجد الاقصى المبارك.\nوالمنبر مصنوع من الخشب المطعّم بالعاج والابنوس، تعب النجّارون والصنّاع والمهندسون فيه سنين، وكان لترديد النظر فيه على الايّام الوفاً، له بوّابه يرتفع فوقها تاجٌ عظيم ثمّ درج يرقى الى قوس اعلاه وشرف خشبيّه.\n\nوفي عام 1389هـ/1969م، احرق المصلى القبلي في حريق الاقصى مما ادى ايضا الى تدمير المنبر بالكامل، ولدى اعاده ترميم الجامع بين عامي 1389هـ/1969م و1402هـ/1982م وقد استحدث منبر حديدي بسيط الصناعه مكان منبر نور الدين، وهو منبر مؤقت بقي هناك حتى تم انشاء منبر اخر مطابق للمنبر الاصلي وبنفس المميزات والمواد في الاردن، وتم تركيبه في بدايه شهر فبراير عام 2007م.\n\nابار الاقصى\nيحتوي الاقصى على 25 بئرا عامره، فيها من الماء ما يكفى سكانَ البلده القديمه بالقدس، وليس للمصلين الذين يفدون الى الاقصى فقط. وهذه الابار موزعه بين صحن الصخره المشرفه في قلب المسجد الاقصى المبارك، وباقي ساحات المسجد الاقصى المبارك، حيث يوجد منها ثمانيه فوق صحن الصخره، وسبعه عشر في الساحات المحيطه ومن اشهرها:\n\nبئر الجنه\nبئر رمانه\n\nمصاطب المسجد الاقصى المبارك\nتنتشر في ساحات المسجد الاقصى المبارك 26 مصطبه، خاصه الساحات الغربيه، واغلبها يعود للفتره العثمانيه، وهي عباره عن مساحات مسطحه ترتفع ببناء لمسافه اقل من متر عن سطح الارض. وتبنى عاده من الحجر، ويتم الوصول اليها من خلال عده درجات. وغالبا ما يكون لها محراب على شكل حنيه او تجويف في جدار صغير يحدد اتجاه القبله. وتستخدم المصاطب للجلوس والصلاه والتدريس، خاصه في فصل الصيف. اغلبها غير مؤرخ\n\nمصاطب غير مؤرخه :\n\nقدسيه المسجد الاقصى عند المسلمين\nكان الاقصى قبله المسلمين الاولى وقبله يهود يثرب، لكن الله امر النبي بتحويل القبله الى المسجد الحرام: ﴿قَدْ نَرَى تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي السَّمَاءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَهً تَرْضَاهَا فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنْتُمْ فَوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ وَاِنَّ الَّذِينَ اُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ لَيَعْلَمُونَ اَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَمَا اللَّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا يَعْمَلُونَ ۝١٤٤ وَلَئِنْ اَتَيْتَ الَّذِينَ اُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ بِكُلِّ ايَهٍ مَا تَبِعُوا قِبْلَتَكَ وَمَا اَنْتَ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَتَهُمْ وَمَا بَعْضُهُمْ بِتَابِعٍ قِبْلَهَ بَعْضٍ وَلَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتَ اَهْوَاءَهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَكَ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ اِنَّكَ اِذًا لَمِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ ۝١٤٥﴾\n\nفضائل المسجد الاقصى\nورد لدى المسلمين في القران، وفي احاديث النبي محمد العديد من فضائل المسجد الاقصى واهميته، منها:\n\nفي القران: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي اَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ اِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْاَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ايَاتِنَا اِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾ (1)\nعن ميمونه بنت الحارث انها قالت: «يا رسول الله افتِنَا في بيت المقدس، فقال: اِيتوهُ فصلُّوا فيه، وكانت البلاد اذ ذاك حربًا، فان لم تاتوه وتصلّوا فيه فابعثوا بزيتٍ يُسرَج في قناديله».\nعن ام سلمه عن النبي محمد انه قال: «من اهلَّ بعمرهٍ من بيتِ المقدسِ غُفر له».\nعن ابي سعيد الخدري، عن النبي محمد انه قال: «لا تُشَدُّ الرحالُ الا الى ثلاثهِ مساجدَ: المسجدِ الحرام، والمسجدِ الاقصَى، ومسجدي هذا».\nعن جابر بن عبد الله، عن النبي محمد انه قال: «صلاهٌ في المسجدِ الحرامِ مائهُ الفِ صلاهٍ، وصلاهٌ في مسجدِي الفُ صلاهٍ، وفي بيتِ المقدسِ خمسمائهِ صلاهٍ».\nعن ابي ذر الغفاري، عن النبي محمد انه قال: «صلاهً في مسجدي هذا (المسجد النبوي) افضلُ من اَرْبَعِ صلواتٍ فيهِ (المسجد الاقصى)، ولَنِعمَ المُصَلى هُوَ، ولِيُوشِكَنَّ اَنْ لا يَكُونَ للرَّجلِ مثلُ شطنِ فرسهِ من الارضِ حيث يَرَى مِنهُ بيتَ المقدسِ خيراً لَهُ مِنَ الدنيا جميعاً».\n\nللمسجد الاقصى قدسيه كبيره عند المسلمين ارتبطت بعقيدتهم منذ بدايه الدعوه. فهو يعتبر قبله الانبياء جميعاً قبل النبي محمد وهو القبله الاولى التي صلى اليها النبي قبل ان يتم تغير القبله الى مكه.\nوقد توثقت علاقه الاسلام بالمسجد الاقصى ليله الاسراء والمعراج، حيث انه اسرى بالنبي من المسجد الحرام الى المسجد الاقصى، وفيه صلى النبي اماماً بالانبياء ومنه عرج النبي الى السماء. وفي السماء العليا فرضت عليه الصلاه.\nذكر القران واصفاً ليله الاسراء والمعراج: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي اَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ اِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْاَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ايَاتِنَا اِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾، ووصف الله للمسجد الاقصى بـ﴿الذي باركنا حوله﴾، يدل على بركه المسجد ومكانته عند الله وعند المسلمين. فالاقصى هو منبع البركه التي عمت كل المنطقه حوله في اعتقاد المسلمين.\nوروي عن ام المؤمنين ام سلمه انها سمعت رسول الله يقول:\n\nوللصلاه في المسجد الاقصى ثواب يعادل خمسمائه صلاه في غيره من المساجد. قال رسول الله: « الصلاه في المسجد الحرام بمائه الف صلاه، والصلاه في مسجدي بالف صلاه، والصلاه في بيت المقدس بخمسمائه صلاه »، وفي روايه اخرى ان الصلاه في المسجد الاقصى تعدل مئتين وخمسين صلاه في غير المساجد الثلاثه.\nوهو المسجد الذي امر النبي الصحابه بالبقاء قربه، فقد روى احمد في مسنده عن ذِي الاصَابِعِ قَال: «قلت: يا رسول الله، اِنِ ابْتُلِينَا بعدك بالبقاء اين تامرنا؟ قال: عليك ببيت المقدس فلعله ان ينشا لك ذريه يعدون الى ذلك المسجد ويروحون».\nويعتبر المسجد الاقصى ثالث المساجد التي تشد اليها الرحال، فقد ذكر النبي ان المساجد الثلاثه الوحيده التي تشد اليها الرحال هي: المسجد الحرام، والمسجد النبوي، والمسجد الاقصى.\n\nوكلها احاديث تدل على مكانه المسجد، وعمق علاقته بالاسلام. وهناك العديد من الاحاديث الاخرى التي ذكرت المسجد الاقصى وحثت على زيارته والصلاه فيه.\n\nحفريات المسجد الاقصى\nفي اعقاب استيلاء اسرائيل على القدس الشرقيه في حرب 1967م، قامت بعده حفريات خارج ساحات المسجد الاقصى او كما تسميه بجبل الهيكل. وفي عام 1970م، بدات السلطات الاسرائيليه بحفريات مكثفه خارج الاسوار بجوار المسجد على الجانبين الجنوبي والغربي. ويعتقد الفلسطينيون ان انفاقا حفرت تحت المسجد الاقصى من اجل تقويض اساساته، وهو الامر الذي نفته القوات الاسرائيليه، وقد زعموا ان اقرب الحفريات الى المسجد كانت نحو 70 مترا الى الجنوب منها. كما قام الاسرائيليون بحفر نفق بالقرب من الجزء الغربي من المسجد عام 1984م. ووفقاً لمبعوث اليونسكو الخاص بالقدس اوليغ غرابار، ذكر ان المباني والهياكل في الحرم القدسي اخذه في التدهور ويرجع ذلك اساسا الى النزاعات بين الاسرائيليين والفلسطينيين والحكومه الاردنيه حول من هو المسؤول عن هذا الموقع.\nفي 2007م قام الاسرائيليون بحفريات جديده للكشف عن اثار مزعومه على بعد 60 مترًا من الحرم القدسي، وقد اثارت هذه الحفريات غضب العالم الاسلامي، واتهموا الاسرائيليين بمحاوله تدمير اسس المسجد. وقد دعا اسماعيل هنيه الفلسطينيين للقيام باحتجاجات ضد هذه الحفريات، بينما قالت حركه فتح انها ستنهي اتفاق وقف اطلاق النار مع اسرائيل.\n\nابرز

      "summary": "ٱلْمَسْجِدُ ٱلْأَقْصَىٰ أحد أكبر مساجد العالم وأحد المساجد الثلاثة التي يشد المسلمون الرحال إليها، كما قال نبي الإسلام محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم؛ وهو أيضًا أول القبلتين في الإسلام. يقع داخل البلدة القديمة بالقدس في فلسطين. وهو كامل المنطقة المحاطة بالسور واسم لكل ما هو داخل سور المسجد الأقصى الواقع في أقصى الزاوية الجنوبية الشرقية من البلدة القديمة المسورة.\nتبلغ مساحته قرابة 144000 متر مربع، ويشمل قبة الصخرة والمسجد القِبْلي والمصلى المرواني ومصلى باب الرحمة، وعدة معالم أخرى يصل عددها إلى 200 معلمًا. ويقع المسجد الأقصى فوق هضبة صغيرة تُسمى «هضبة موريا»، وتعد الصخرة أعلى نقطة فيه، وتقع في قلبه.\nذُكر المسجد الأقصى في القرآن: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ۝١﴾ [الإسراء:1] (1).\nيُقدّس اليهود أيضًا المكان نفسه، ويطلقون على ساحات المسجد الأقصى اسمَ «جبل الهيكل» نسبة إلى هيكل النبي سليمان، وتُحاول العديد من المنظمات اليهودية التذرع بهذه الحجة لبناء الهيكل حسب مُعتقدها.",
