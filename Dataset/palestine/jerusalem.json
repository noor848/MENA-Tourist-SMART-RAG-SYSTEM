      "content": "Jerusalem is a city in the Southern Levant, on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Both Israel and Palestine claim Jerusalem as their capital city; Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there, while Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power. Neither claim is widely recognised internationally.\nThroughout its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. During the Canaanite period (14th century BCE) Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning \"City of Shalem\" after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 10th century BCE (Iron Age II), and by the 9th century BCE the city had developed into the religious and administrative centre of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538 the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today those walls define the Old City, which since the 19th century has been divided into four quarters—the Armenian, Christian, Jewish and Muslim quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2023 Jerusalem had a population of 1,028,366. In 2022 60% were Jews and almost 40% were Palestinians. In 2020 the population was 951,100, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353,800 (37.2%), Christians 16,300 (1.7%) and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son King Solomon commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Israelites branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous—and later monotheistic—religion centred on El/Yahweh. These foundational events assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city (Hebrew: עיר הקודש, romanized: 'Ir ha-Qodesh) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians adopted as the Old Testament, was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection there. Meanwhile, in Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. The city was the first standard direction for Muslim prayers, and in Islamic tradition, Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he spoke to God, per the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (3⁄8 sq mi), the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nAt present, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, Jerusalem was to be \"established as a corpus separatum under a special international regime\" administered by the United Nations. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas incorporated into Israel, while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was occupied and annexed by Jordan. Israel occupied East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into the city's municipality, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residences of the prime minister and president, and the Supreme Court. The international community rejects the annexation as illegal and regards East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.\n\nEtymology and names\nEtymology\nThe name \"Jerusalem\" is variously etymologised to mean \"foundation (Semitic yry' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of the pagan god Shalem\"; the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city.\nShalim or Shalem was the name of the god of dusk in the Canaanite religion, whose name is based on the same root S-L-M from which the Hebrew word for \"peace\" is derived (Shalom in Hebrew, cognate with Arabic Salam). The name thus offered itself to etymologisations such as \"The City of Peace\", \"Abode of Peace\", \"Dwelling of Peace\" (\"founded in safety\"), or \"Vision of Peace\" in some Christian authors.\nThe ending -ayim indicates the dual, thus leading to the suggestion that the name Yerushalayim refers to the fact that the city initially sat on two hills.\n\nAncient Egyptian sources\nThe Execration Texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 19th century BCE), which refer to a city called rwšꜣlmm or ꜣwšꜣmm, variously transcribed as Rušalimum, or Urušalimum, may indicate Jerusalem. Alternatively, the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE), which reference an Úrušalim, may be the earliest mention of the city.\n\nHebrew Bible and Jewish sources\nThe form Yerushalem or Yerushalayim first appears in the Bible, in the Book of Joshua. According to a Midrash, the name is a combination of two names united by God, Yireh (\"the abiding place\", the name given by Abraham to the place where he planned to sacrifice his son) and Shalem (\"Place of Peace\", the name given by high priest Shem).\n\nOldest written mention of Jerusalem\nOne of the earliest extra-biblical Hebrew writing of the word Jerusalem is dated to the sixth or seventh century BCE and was discovered in Khirbet Beit Lei near Beit Guvrin in 1961. The inscription states: \"I am Yahweh thy God, I will accept the cities of Judah and I will redeem Jerusalem\", or as other scholars suggest: \"Yahweh is the God of the whole earth. The mountains of Judah belong to him, to the God of Jerusalem\". An earlier example of the name appears in a papyrus from the 7th century BCE.\n\nIn extra-biblical inscriptions, the earliest known example of the -ayim ending was discovered on a column about 3 km west of ancient Jerusalem, dated to the first century BCE.\n\nJebus, Zion, City of David\nAn ancient settlement of Jerusalem, founded as early as the Bronze Age on the hill above the Gihon Spring, was, according to the Bible, named Jebus. Called the \"Fortress of Zion\" (metsudat Zion), it was renamed as the \"City of David\", and was known by this name in antiquity. Another name, \"Zion\", initially referred to a distinct part of the city, but later came to signify the city as a whole, and afterwards to represent the whole biblical Land of Israel.\n\nGreek, Roman and Byzantine names\nIn Greek and Latin the city's name was transliterated Hierosolyma/Hierosoluma (Greek: Ἱεροσόλυμα; in Greek hieròs, ἱερός, means holy), and was the term used by Matthew and Mark in their gospels instead of the Hebrew term.\nUp until the 2010s the consensus among historians was that following Alexander the Great's conquest, Hierosoluma was set to be incorporated into the larger temple cities of the Seleucid kingdom, and to be Hellenised as Hierapolis. However, modern historians dispute this as a proper Ancient Greek translation for the polis would be similar to Hierolophos.\nAfter the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), the city was renamed Aelia Capitolina during the Roman period of its history. Named for the Roman emperor Hadrian and the deities of Rome, the name lasted until the Byzantine era.\n\nSalem\nThe Aramaic Apocryphon of Genesis of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1QapGen 22:13) equates Jerusalem with the earlier \"Salem\" (שלם), said to be the kingdom of Melchizedek in Genesis 14. Other early Hebrew sources, early Christian renderings of the verse and targumim, however, put Salem in Northern Israel near Shechem (Sichem), now Nablus, a city of some importance in early sacred Hebrew writing. Possibly the redactor of the Apocryphon of Genesis wanted to dissociate Melchizedek from the area of Shechem, which at the time was in possession of the Samaritans. However that may be, later Rabbinic sources also equate Salem with Jerusalem, mainly to link Melchizedek to later Temple traditions.\n\nArabic names\nOriginally titled Bayt al-Maqdis, today, Jerusalem is most commonly known in Arabic as القُدس, transliterated as al-Quds and meaning \"the holy\" or \"the holy sanctuary\", cognate with Hebrew: הקדש, romanized: ha-qodesh. The name is possibly a shortened form of مدينة القُدس Madīnat al-Quds \"city of the holy sanctuary\" after the Hebrew nickname with the same meaning, Ir ha-Qodesh (עיר הקדש). The ق (Q) is pronounced either with a voiceless uvular plosive (/q/), as in Classical Arabic, or with a glottal stop (ʔ) as in Levantine Arabic. Official Israeli government policy mandates that أُورُشَلِيمَ, transliterated as Ūrušalīm, which is the name frequently used in Christian translations of the Bible into Arabic, be used as the Arabic language name for the city in conjunction with القُدس, giving أُورُشَلِيمَ-القُدس, Ūrušalīm-al-Quds. Palestinian Arab families who hail from this city are often called \"Qudsi\" (قُدسي) or \"Maqdasi\" (مقدسي), while Palestinian Muslim Jerusalemites may use these terms as a demonym.\n\nHistory\nJerusalem is one of the world's oldest cities, with a history spanning over 5,000 years. Its origins trace back to around 3000 BCE, with the first settlement near the Gihon Spring. The city is first mentioned in Egyptian Execration texts around 2000 BCE as \"Rusalimum.\" By the 17th century BCE Jerusalem had developed into a fortified city under Canaanite rule, with massive walls protecting its water system. During the Late Bronze Age Jerusalem became a vassal of Ancient Egypt, as documented in the Amarna letters.\nThe city's importance grew during the Israelite period, which began around 1000 BCE when King David captured Jerusalem and made it the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel. David's son King Solomon built the First Temple, establishing the city as a major religious centre. Following the kingdom's split Jerusalem became the capital of the Kingdom of Judah until it was captured by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE. The Babylonians destroyed the First Temple, leading to the Babylonian exile of the Jewish population. After the Persian conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE, Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews to return and rebuild the city and its temple, marking the start of the Second Temple period. Jerusalem fell under Hellenistic rule after the conquests of Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, leading to increasing cultural and political influence from Greece. The Hasmonean revolt in 164 BCE briefly restored Jewish sovereignty, with Jerusalem as the capital of an independent state.\nIn 63 BCE Jerusalem was captured by Pompey and brought under the rule of the Roman Republic. The city was embellished by Herod the Great, who expanded the Second Temple, making it one of the largest sanctuaries in the ancient world. Tensions between the Jews and the Roman Empire eventually escalated into the First Jewish Revolt, resulting in the siege and destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70 CE. A few decades later, the city was rebuilt as the Roman colony Aelia Capitolina, dedicated to Jupiter, provoking the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–136 CE). After the revolt's suppression, Jews were banned from the city. During the Byzantine period, Jerusalem gained prominence as a centre of Christian pilgrimage, especially after Constantine the Great supported the construction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 638 CE, Jerusalem was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate, and under early Islamic rule, the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque were built, solidifying its religious importance in Islam.\nDuring the Crusades Jerusalem changed hands multiple times, being captured by the Crusaders in 1099 and recaptured by Saladin in 1187. It remained under Islamic control through the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, until it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517. In the modern period Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Israel captured East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967, uniting the city under Israeli control. The status of Jerusalem remains a highly contentious issue, with both Israelis and Palestinians claiming it as their capital. Historiographically, the city's history is often interpreted through the lens of competing national narratives. Israeli scholars emphasise the ancient Jewish connection to the city, while Palestinian narratives highlight the city's broader historical and multicultural significance. Both perspectives influence contemporary discussions of Jerusalem's status and future.\n\nPolitical status\nFrom 1923 until 1948 Jerusalem served as the administrative capital of Mandatory Palestine.\nFrom 1949 until 1967 West Jerusalem served as Israel's capital, but was not recognised as such internationally because UN General Assembly Resolution 194 envisaged Jerusalem as an international city. As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of Jerusalem came under Israeli control. On 27 June 1967, the government of Levi Eshkol extended Israeli law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, but agreed that administration of the Temple Mount compound would be maintained by the Jordanian waqf, under the Jordanian Ministry of Religious Endowments.\nIn 1988 the Israeli government ordered the closure of Orient House, home of the Arab Studies Society, but also the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization, for security reasons. The building reopened in 1992 as a Palestinian guesthouse. The Oslo Accords stated that the final status of Jerusalem would be determined by negotiations with the Palestinian Authority. The accords banned any official Palestinian presence in the city until a final peace agreement, but provided for the opening of a Palestinian trade office in East Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority regards East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas has said that any agreement that did not include East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine would be unacceptable. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has similarly stated that Jerusalem would remain the undivided capital of Israel. Due to its proximity to the city, especially the Temple Mount, Abu Dis, a Palestinian suburb of Jerusalem, has been proposed as the future capital of a Palestinian state by Israel. Israel has not incorporated Abu Dis within its security wall around Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority has built a possible future parliament building for the Palestinian Legislative Council in the town, and its Jerusalem Affairs Offices are all located in Abu Dis.\n\nInternational status\nWhile the international community regards East Jerusalem, including the entire Old City, as part of the occupied Palestinian territories, neither part, West or East Jerusalem, is recognised as part of the territory of Israel or the State of Palestine. Under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1947, Jerusalem was envisaged to become a corpus separatum administered by the United Nations. In the war of 1948 the western part of the city was occupied by forces of the nascent state of Israel, while the eastern part was occupied by Jordan. The international community largely considers the legal status of Jerusalem to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognise Israeli sovereignty over the city.\n\nStatus under Israeli rule\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel extended its jurisdiction and administration over East Jerusalem, establishing new municipal borders.\n\nIn 2010 Israel approved legislation giving Jerusalem the highest national priority status in Israel. The law prioritised construction throughout the city, and offered grants and tax benefits to residents to make housing, infrastructure, education, employment, business, tourism and cultural events more affordable. Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon said that the bill sent \"a clear, unequivocal political message that Jerusalem will not be divided\", and that \"all those within the Palestinian and international community who expect the current Israeli government to accept any demands regarding Israel's sovereignty over its capital are mistaken and misleading\".\nThe status of the city, and especially its holy places, remains a core issue in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The Israeli government has approved building plans in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City in order to expand the Jewish presence in East Jerusalem, while some Islamic leaders have made claims that Jews have no historical connection to Jerusalem, alleging that the 2,500-year-old Western Wall was constructed as part of a mosque. Palestinians regard Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine, and the city's borders have been the subject of bilateral talks. A team of experts assembled by the then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in 2000 concluded that the city must be divided, since Israel had failed to achieve any of its national aims there.\nHowever, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in 2014 that \"Jerusalem will never be divided\". A poll conducted in June 2013 found that 74% of Israeli Jews reject the idea of a Palestinian capital in any portion of Jerusalem, though 72% of the public regarded it as a divided city. A poll conducted by the Palestinian Centre for Public Opinion and American Pechter Middle East Polls for the Council on Foreign Relations among East Jerusalem Arab residents in 2011 revealed that 39% of East Jerusalem Arab residents would prefer Israeli citizenship, while 31% opted for Palestinian citizenship. According to the poll 40% of Palestinian residents would prefer to leave their neighbourhoods if they would be placed under Palestinian rule.\n\nJerusalem as capital of Israel\nOn 5 December 1949 Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, proclaimed Jerusalem as Israel's \"eternal\" and \"sacred\" capital, and eight days later specified that only the war had \"compelled\" the Israeli leadership \"to establish the seat of Government in Tel Aviv\", while \"for the State of Israel there has always been and always will be one capital only—Jerusalem the Eternal\", and that after the war, efforts had been ongoing for creating the conditions for \"the Knesset... returning to Jerusalem.\" This indeed took place, and since the beginning of 1950 all branches of the Israeli government—legislative, judicial and executive—have resided there, except for the Ministry of Defense, which is located at HaKirya in Tel Aviv. At the time of Ben Gurion's proclamations and the ensuing Knesset vote of 24 January 1950, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan, and thus the proclamation only applied to West Jerusalem.\nIn July 1980 Israel passed the Jerusalem Law as Basic Law. The law declared Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel. The Jerusalem Law was condemned by the international community, which did not recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 478 on 20 August 1980, which declared that the Jerusalem Law is \"a violation of international law\", is \"null and void and must be rescinded forthwith\". Member states were called upon to withdraw their diplomatic representation from Jerusalem.\nFollowing the resolution, 22 of the 24 countries that previously had their embassy in (West) Jerusalem relocated them in Tel Aviv, where many embassies already resided prior to Resolution 478. Costa Rica and El Salvador followed in 2006. There are five embassies—United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Papua New Guinea and Kosovo—and two consulates located within the city limits of Jerusalem. Paraguay maintains an embassy in the Jerusalem District town of Mevaseret Zion, in addition to Bolivia whose embassy is now closed. There are a number of consulates-general located in Jerusalem, which work primarily either with Israel, or the Palestinian authorities.\nIn 1995 the United States Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which required, subject to conditions, that its embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. On 6 December 2017 the US president, Donald Trump, officially recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and announced his intention to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, reversing decades of United States policy on the issue. The move was criticised by many nations. A resolution condemning the US decision was supported by all the 14 other members of the UN Security Council, but was vetoed by the US on 18 December 2017. A subsequent resolution condemning the US decision was passed in the United Nations General Assembly. On 14 May 2018 the United States officially opened its embassy in Jerusalem, transforming its Tel Aviv location into a consulate. Due to the general lack of international recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, some non-Israeli media outlets use Tel Aviv as a metonym for Israel.\nIn December 2017, US President Donald Trump made the decision to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to that city. This decision faced significant opposition, particularly from leaders within the Arab and Muslim communities. The Palestinians assert that East Jerusalem should serve as the capital of their future state, and its status ought to be resolved through peace negotiations as outlined in the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas remarked that Trump's action effectively negated the United States' position as a mediator in the peace process. Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Islamist Hamas movement, urged for a new \"intifada,\" or uprising. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized the decision, stating it would \"place the region in a ring of fire.\" Saudi Arabia's King Salman described it as \"a clear provocation to Muslims globally.\" Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi indicated that this decision would exacerbate the situation in the region. Iran warned that the decision would incite a \"new intifada,\" labeling it a blatant infringement of international resolutions.\nIn April 2017 the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced it viewed Western Jerusalem as Israel's capital in the context of UN-approved principles which include the status of East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian state. On 15 December 2018 the Australian government officially recognised West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but said their embassy in Tel Aviv would stay until a two-state resolution was settled. The decision was reversed in October 2022.\n\nGovernment precinct and national institutions\nThe Kiryat HaLeom (national precinct) project is intended to house most government agencies and national cultural institutions. They are located in the Kiryat HaMemshala (government complex) in the Givat Ram neighbourhood. Some government buildings are located in Kiryat Menachem Begin. The city is home to the Knesset, the Supreme Court, the Bank of Israel, the National Headquarters of the Israel Police, the official residences of the president and the prime minister, the Cabinet, and all ministries except for the Ministry of Defense (which is located in central Tel Aviv's HaKirya district) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (which is located in Rishon LeZion, in the wider Tel Aviv metropolitan area, near Beit Dagan).\n\nIsraeli settlements\nSince its capture in 1967, the Israeli government has built 12 Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, with a population amounting to 220,000 Israeli Jewish settlers as of 2019. The international community consider Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law.\n\nJerusalem as capital of Palestine\nThe Palestinian National Authority views East Jerusalem as occupied territory according to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. The Palestinian Authority claims Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharif, as the capital of the State of Palestine, The PLO claims that West Jerusalem is also subject to permanent status negotiations. However, it has stated that it would be willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making Jerusalem an open city.\nThe PLO's position is that East Jerusalem, as defined by the pre-1967 municipal boundaries, shall be the capital of Palestine and West Jerusalem the capital of Israel, with each state enjoying full sovereignty over its respective part of the city and with its own municipality. A joint development council would be responsible for coordinated development. Orient House in East Jerusalem served as the headquarters of the PLO in the 1980s and 1990s. It was closed by Israel in 2001, two days after the Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing.\nSome states, such as Russia and China, recognise the Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 58/292 affirmed that the Palestinian people have the right to sovereignty over East Jerusalem.\n\nPalestinian offices and institutions\nGovernment offices are located outside the Israeli municipal limits include the Palestinian Security Services, Force 17, the Preventative Security Service and the Ministry of Interior. There is a Palestinian Authority regional office and an electoral office located in the Dahiyat al Barid neighbourhood.\n\nMunicipal administration\nThe Jerusalem City Council is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies. The former mayor of Jerusalem, Uri Lupolianski, was elected in 2003. In the November 2008 city elections, Nir Barkat was elected. In November 2018 Moshe Lion was elected mayor.\nApart from the mayor and his deputies, City Council members receive no salaries and work on a voluntary basis. The longest-serving Jerusalem mayor is Teddy Kollek, who spent 28 years—six consecutive terms—in office. Most of the meetings of the Jerusalem City Council are private, but each month, it holds a session that is open to the public. Within the city council, religious political parties form an especially powerful faction, accounting for the majority of its seats.\nThe headquarters of the Jerusalem Municipality and the mayor's office are at Safra Square (Kikar Safra) on Jaffa Road. The municipal complex, comprising two modern buildings and ten renovated historic buildings surrounding a large plaza, opened in 1993 when it moved from the old town hall building built by the Mandate authorities. The city falls under the Jerusalem District, with Jerusalem as the district's capital. 37% of the population is Palestinian, but in 2014 not more than 10% of tax revenues were allocated for them. In East Jerusalem, 52% of the land was excluded from development, 35% designated for Jewish settlements, and 13% for Palestinian use, almost all of which was already built upon.\nIn the Oslo I Accord, certain parts of few neighbourhoods were allotted to the Palestinian Authority. Parts of Sur Baher, Wadi al-Hummus, Umm Leisun and Umm Tuba, altogether came under Area A, which is completely controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Al-Ram and Dahiyat al-Barid are mostly in Area B, where both Palestine and Israel has control. Other parts of Beit Hanina, Kafr Aqab and Arab al-Jahalin also falls under Area B.\n\nGeography\nJerusalem is situated on the southern spur of a plateau in the Judaean Mountains, which include the Mount of Olives (East) and Mount Scopus (North East). The elevation of the Old City is approximately 760 m (2,490 ft). The whole of Jerusalem is surrounded by valleys and dry riverbeds (wadis). The Kidron, Hinnom, and Tyropoeon Valleys intersect in an area just south of the Old City of Jerusalem. The Kidron Valley runs to the east of the Old City and separates the Mount of Olives from the city proper. Along the southern side of old Jerusalem is the Valley of Hinnom, a steep ravine associated in biblical eschatology with the concept of Gehenna or Hell.\nThe Tyropoeon Valley commenced in the northwest near the Damascus Gate, ran south-southeasterly through the centre of the Old City down to the Pool of Siloam, and divided the lower part into two hills, the Temple Mount to the east, and the rest of the city to the west, the lower and the upper cities described by Josephus. Today, this valley is hidden by debris that has accumulated over the centuries. In biblical times Jerusalem was surrounded by forests of almond, olive and pine trees. These were destroyed by centuries of warfare and neglect. Farmers in the Jerusalem region built stone terraces along the slopes to hold back the soil, a feature still very much in evidence in the Jerusalem landscape.\nWater supply has always been a major problem in Jerusalem, as attested to by the intricate network of ancient aqueducts, tunnels, pools and cisterns found in the city.\nJerusalem is 60 km (37 mi) east of Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean Sea. On the opposite side of the city, approximately 35 km (22 mi) away, is the Dead Sea, the lowest body of water on Earth. Neighbouring cities and towns include Bethlehem and Beit Jala to the south, Abu Dis and Ma'ale Adumim to the east, Mevaseret Zion to the west, and Ramallah and Giv'at Ze'ev to the north.\nMount Herzl, at the western side of the city near the Jerusalem Forest, serves as the national cemetery of Israel.\n\nClimate\nThe city is characterised by a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa), with hot, dry summers, and mild, wet winters. Snow flurries usually occur once or twice a winter, although the city experiences heavy snowfall every three to four years, on average, with short-lived accumulation.\nJanuary is the coldest month of the year, with an average temperature of 9.1 °C (48.4 °F); July and August are the hottest months, with an average temperature of 24.2 °C (75.6 °F), and the summer months are usually rainless. The average annual precipitation is around 537 mm (21 in), with rain occurring almost entirely between October and May. Snowfall is rare, and large snowfalls are even more rare. Jerusalem received over 30 cm (12 in) of snow on 13 December 2013, which nearly paralysed the city. A day in Jerusalem has on average, 9.3 sunshine hours. With summers averaging similar temperatures as the coastline, the maritime influence from the Mediterranean Sea is strong, in particular given that Jerusalem is located on a similar latitude as scorching hot deserts not far to its east.\nThe highest recorded temperature in Jerusalem was 44.4 °C (111.9 °F) on 28 and 30 August 1881, and the lowest temperature recorded was −6.7 °C (19.9 °F) on 25 January 1907.\nMost of the air pollution in Jerusalem comes from vehicular traffic. Many main streets in Jerusalem were not built to accommodate such a large volume of traffic, leading to traffic congestion and more carbon monoxide released into the air. Industrial pollution inside the city is sparse, but emissions from factories on the Israeli Mediterranean coast can travel eastward and settle over the city.\n\nDemographics\nDemographic history\nJerusalem's population size and composition have shifted many times over its 5,000-year history. Since the 19th century, the Old City of Jerusalem has been divided into Jewish, Muslim, Christian and Armenian quarters. Matthew Teller writes that this convention may have originated in the 1841 British Royal Engineers map of Jerusalem, or at least the Rev. George Williams' subsequent labelling of it.\nMost population data before 1905 are based on estimates, often from foreign travellers or organisations, since previous census data usually covered wider areas such as the Jerusalem District. These estimates suggest that since the end of the Crusades, Muslims formed the largest group in Jerusalem until the mid-nineteenth century.\nBetween 1838 and 1876 a number of estimates exist which conflict as to whether Jews or Muslims were the largest group during this period, and between 1882 and 1922 estimates conflict as to exactly when Jews became an absolute majority of the population.\n\nCurrent demographics\nIn December 2007 Jerusalem had a population of 747,600—63.7% were Jewish, 33.1% Muslim, and 2% Christian.\nAccording to a study published in 2000, the percentage of Jews in the city's population had been decreasing; this was attributed to a higher Muslim birth rate, and Jewish residents leaving. The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City's 32,488 people were Jews. Of the Jewish population, 200,000 live in East Jerusalem settlements which are considered illegal under international law.\nIn 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the United States, France and the former Soviet Union. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in. Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high birth rate, especially in the Haredi Jewish and Arab communities. Consequently, the total fertility rate in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem's 180,000 households is 3.8 people.\nIn 2005 the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%)—similar to the Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is 42%.\nIn 1967 Jews accounted for 74% of the population, while the figure for 2006 is down by 9%. Possible factors are the high cost of housing, fewer job opportunities and the increasingly religious character of the city, although proportionally, young Haredim are leaving in higher numbers. The percentage of secular Jews, or those who 'wear their faith lightly' is dropping, with some 20,000 leaving the city over the past seven years (2012). They now number 31% of the population, the same percentage as the rising Haredi population.\nIn 2010, 61% of all Jewish children in Jerusalem studied in Haredi (Ultra-Orthodox) schools. This correlates with the high number of children in Haredi families.\nWhile some secular Jews leave Jerusalem for its relative lack of development and religious and political tensions, Jerusalem-born Palestinians cannot leave Jerusalem, or they lose their right to live in the city. Palestinians with a \"Jerusalem resident status\" are entitled to the subsidised healthcare and social security benefits Israel provides to its citizens, and have the right to vote in municipal elections, but not to be voted in municipal elections, or to vote in national elections. Arabs in Jerusalem can send their children to Israeli-run schools, although not every neighbourhood has one, and universities. Israeli doctors and highly regarded hospitals such as Hadassah Medical Centre are available to residents.\nDemographics and the Jewish-Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jerusalem. In 1998, the Jerusalem Development Authority expanded city limits to the west to include more areas heavily populated with Jews.\n\nWithin the past few years, there has been a steady increase in the Jewish birthrate and a steady decrease in the Arab birthrate. In May 2012 it was reported that the Jewish birthrate had overtaken the Arab birthrate. The city's birthrate stands about 4.2 children per Jewish family and 3.9 children per Arab family. In addition, increasing numbers of Jewish immigrants chose to settle in Jerusalem. In the last few years, thousands of Palestinians have moved to previously fully Jewish neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem, built after the 1967 Six-Day War. In 2007, 1,300 Palestinians lived in the previously exclusively Jewish neighbourhood of Pisgat Ze'ev and constituted 3% of the population in Neve Ya'akov. In the French Hill neighbourhood Palestinians today constitute one-sixth of the overall population.At the end of 2008 the population of East Jerusalem was 456,300, comprising 60% of Jerusalem's residents. Of these 195,500 (43%) were Jews, (comprising 40% of the Jewish population of Jerusalem as a whole), and 260,800 (57%) were Muslim (comprising 98% of the Muslim population of Jerusalem). In 2008 the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported the number of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem was 208,000 according to a recently completed census.\nJerusalem's Jewish population is overwhelmingly religious. Only 18% of Jewish residents are secular. In addition, Haredi Jews comprise 35% of the city's adult Jewish population. In a phenomenon seen rarely around the world, the percentage of Jewish women who work, 81%, exceeds the percentage of Jewish men who work, 70%.\nJerusalem had a population of 804,400 in 2011, of which Jews comprised 499,400 (62.1%), Muslims 281,100 (34.9%), Christians 14,700 (1.8%), and 9,000 (1.1%) were not classified by religion.\nJerusalem had a population of 882,700 in 2016, of which Jews comprised 536,600 (60.8%), Muslims 319,800 (36.2%), Christians 15,800 (1.8%), and 10,300 unclassified (1.2%).\nJerusalem had a population of 951,100 in 2020, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353.800 (37.2%), Christians 16.300 (1.7%), and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\n\nAccording to Peace Now, approvals for building in Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem expanded by 60% under Donald Trump's first US presidency. Since 1991, Palestinians, who make up the majority of the residents in East Jerusalem, have only received 30% of the building permits.\n\nUrban planning issues\nCritics of efforts to promote a Jewish majority in Jerusalem say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction. According to a World Bank report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighbourhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West Jerusalem than in East Jerusalem; Arabs in Jerusalem were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and \"the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators\" than Jewish violators of the permit process. In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the City of David archaeological site in the 60% Arab neighbourhood of Silwan (adjacent to the Old City), and the Museum of Tolerance on Mamilla Cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square).\n\nReligious significance\nJerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city. Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy. The Temple Mount is the holiest spot in Judaism and the third holiest site in Islam. Jews venerate it as the site of the two former Temples and Muslims believe that Muhammad was transported from the Great Mosque of Mecca to this location during the Night Journey.\n\nJudaism\nJerusalem has been the holiest city in Judaism and the ancestral and spiritual homeland of the Jewish people since King David proclaimed it his capital in the 10th century BCE. Without counting its other names, Jerusalem appears in the Hebrew Bible 669 times. The first five books of the Torah (Pentateuch), only mentions Moriah, but in the rest of the Bible, the city is mentioned explicitly. The Temple Mount, which was the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Temple, is the holiest site in Judaism and the place Jews throughout the world turn towards during prayer. The Western Wall, a remnant of the wall surrounding the Second Temple, attracts over 10 million visitors each year. Synagogues around the world are traditionally built with the Holy Ark facing Jerusalem, and Arks within Jerusalem face the Holy of Holies. As prescribed in the Mishna and codified in the Shulchan Aruch, daily prayers are recited while facing towards Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Many Jews have \"Mizrach\" plaques hung on a wall of their homes to indicate the direction of prayer. Many parts of Jewish liturgy mention Jerusalem, including at the conclusion of the Passover Seder when participants declare \"Next Year in Jerusalem!\" The fourteenth blessing of the Amidah prayer, said three times per day is a request that the Jerusalem be rebuilt, as well as the \"Shechinah\" be returned to Zion. The \"Grace After Meals\" which is said after eating a meal including bread, has multiple references to Jerusalem. The entire fast day of Tisha B'Av is dedicated to remembering and mourning the destruction of the first and second temples in Jerusalem.\n\nChristianity\nJerusalem is generally considered the cradle of Christianity. Christianity reveres Jerusalem for its Old Testament history, and also for its significance in the life of Jesus. According to the New Testament, Jesus was brought to Jerusalem soon after his birth and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple. The Cenacle, believed to be the site of Jesus' Last Supper, is located on Mount Zion in the same building that houses the Tomb of King David. Another prominent Christian site in Jerusalem is Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion. The Gospel of John describes it as being located outside Jerusalem, but recent archaeological evidence suggests Golgotha is a short distance from the Old City walls, within the present-day confines of the city. The land occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is considered one of the top candidates for Golgotha and thus has been a Christian pilgrimage site for the past 2000 years. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is generally considered the most important church in Christendom. It contains the two holiest sites in Christianity: the site where Jesus was crucified, and Jesus's empty tomb, where he is believed by Christians to have been buried and resurrected.\n\nIslam\nJerusalem is the third-holiest city in Sunni Islam. Islamic tradition holds that for approximately a year, before it was permanently switched to the Kaaba in Mecca, the qibla (direction of prayer) for Muslims was Jerusalem. The city's lasting place in Islam, however, is primarily due to Muhammad's Night Journey (c. 620 CE). Muslims believe that Muhammad was miraculously transported one night from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, whereupon he ascended to Heaven to meet previous prophets of Islam. The first verse in the Qur'an's Surat al-Isra notes the destination of Muhammad's journey as al-masjid al-aqṣā (\"the farthest place of prayer\"). In the earliest days of Islam, this was understood as a reference to a site in the heavens, however, Post-Rashidun Islamic scholars understood it as relating to Jerusalem, and particularly to the site of the former Jewish Temple. The hadith, a collection of the sayings of Muhammad, mentions that the location of the Al-Aqsa Mosque is in Jerusalem. The Al-Aqsa Mosque, originally named after the wider compound it sits within, was built on the Temple Mount under the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid several decades after Muhammad's death to commemorate the place from which Muslims believe he had ascended to Heaven.\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, Jerusalem's economy was supported almost exclusively by religious pilgrims, as it was far from the major ports of Jaffa and Gaza. Jerusalem's religious and cultural landmarks today remain the top draw for foreign visitors, with the majority of tourists visiting the Western Wall and the Old City. In 2010, Jerusalem was named the top leisure travel city in Africa and the Middle East by Travel + Leisure magazine. In 2013, 75% of the 3.5 million tourists to Israel visited Jerusalem.\n\nSince the establishment of the State of Israel, the national government has remained a major player in Jerusalem's economy. The government, centred in Jerusalem, generates a large number of jobs, and offers subsidies and incentives for new business initiatives and start-ups. Although Tel Aviv remains Israel's financial centre, a growing number of high tech companies are moving to Jerusalem, providing 12,000 jobs in 2006. Northern Jerusalem's Har Hotzvim industrial park and the Jerusalem Technology Park in south Jerusalem are home to large Research and Development centres of international tech companies, among them Intel, Cisco Systems, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, IBM, Mobileye, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and more. In April 2015 Time magazine picked Jerusalem as one of the five emerging tech hubs in the world, proclaiming that \"The city has become a flourishing centre for biomed, cleantech, Internet/mobile startups, accelerators, investors and supporting service providers.\"\n\nHigher than average percentages are employed in education (17.9% vs. 12.7%); health and welfare (12.6% vs. 10.7%); community and social services (6.4% vs. 4.7%); hotels and restaurants (6.1% vs. 4.7%); and public administration (8.2% vs. 4.7%). During the British Mandate, a law was passed requiring all buildings to be constructed of Jerusalem stone in order to preserve the unique historic and aesthetic character of the city. Complementing this building code, which is still in force, is the discouragement of heavy industry in Jerusalem; only about 2.2% of Jerusalem's land is zoned for \"industry and infrastructure\". By comparison, the percentage of land in Tel Aviv zoned for industry and infrastructure is twice as high, and in Haifa, seven times as high. Only 8.5% of the Jerusalem District work force is employed in the manufacturing sector, which is half the national average (15.8%).\nAlthough many statistics indicate economic growth in the city, since 1967, East Jerusalem has lagged behind the development of West Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the percentage of households with employed persons is higher for Arab households (76.1%) than for Jewish households (66.8%). The unemployment rate in Jerusalem (8.3%) is slightly better than the national average (9.0%), although the civilian labour force accounted for less than half of all persons fifteen years or older—lower in comparison to that of Tel Aviv (58.0%) and Haifa (52.4%). Poverty remains a problem in the city as 37% of the families in Jerusalem lived in 2011 below the poverty line. According to a report by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), 78% of Arabs in Jerusalem lived in poverty in 2012, up from 64% in 2006. While the ACRI attributes the increase to the lack of employment opportunities, infrastructure and a worsening educational system, the activist group Ir Amim blames the legal status of Palestinians in Jerusalem.\nThe increasing number of educated Palestinians in Jerusalem has brought about positive economic changes. Through reforms and initiatives in sectors like technology, tourism, trade, and infrastructure, they have helped drive economic growth, create jobs, and improve living conditions in the city. Various joint summits between Israeli and Palestinian entrepreneurs have been held in the city. Palestine Investment Fund have proposed various projects in Jerusalem. Palestinian industrialist Bashar Masri sought to make heavy investments in the city. PA controlled industrial areas are located outskirts of Jerusalem, primarily in Bir Nabala, Abu Dis and Eizariya, engaging in manufacture of tires, food products and concretes.\nHigh-tech industry is emerged among Palestinian society of Jerusalem. In 2023 Israel opened a technology park in East Jerusalem, known as EasTech. Local Palestinian engineers are employed in the complex by multinational companies, some of which includes AT&T, Natural Intelligence, Nvidia, Unity and Synamedia. Station J, an innovation hub is located in Sheikh Jarrah, which is yet another tech hub for Palestinians in the city. Hani Alami, a Jerusalem-based Palestinian entrepreneur has set up a start-+up accelerator. As a part of Israeli–Palestinian economic peace efforts, interaction between Israeli and Palestinian business community, also contributes in growth of Palestinian IT sector in the city.\n\nUrban structure\nHigh-rise construction\nJerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline. About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter. One of them, Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem's tallest building, is a skyscraper by international standards, rising 32 stories. Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height.\n\nA new master plan for the city will see many high-rise buildings, including skyscrapers, built in certain, designated areas of downtown Jerusalem. Under the plan, towers will line Jaffa Road and King George Street. One of the proposed towers along King George Street, the Migdal Merkaz HaYekum, is planned as a 65-story building, which would make it one of the tallest buildings in Israel. At the entrance to the city, near the Jerusalem Chords Bridge and the Central Bus Station, twelve towers rising between 24 and 33 stories will be built, as part of a complex that will also include an open square and an underground train station serving a new express line between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and will be connected by bridges and tunnels. Eleven of the skyscrapers will be either office or apartment buildings, and one will be a 2,000-room hotel. The complex is expected to attract many businesses from Tel Aviv, and become the city's main business hub. In addition, a complex for the city's courts and the prosecutor's office will be built, as well as new buildings for Central Zionist Archives and Israel State Archives. The skyscrapers built throughout the city are expected to contain public space, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, and it has been speculated that this may lead to a revitalization of downtown Jerusalem. In August 2015, the city council approved construction of a 344-foot pyramid-shaped skyscraper designed by Daniel Libeskind and Yigal Levi, in place of a rejected previous design by Libeskind; it was set to break ground by 2019.\n\nNew projects in Jerusalem\nIn 2021 Bashar Masri announced and launched \"Lana\", a massive mix-used project in East Jerusalem, which is located in the neighbourhood of Beit Hanina. The project is in a partnership between Massar International and the Orthodox Church of Jerusalem. It features 400 residential apartments along with a vibrant commercial centre that hosts well-known global brands, cinemas, restaurants, cafés and offices. The project also includes modern educational facilities, such as a school and a kindergarten, catering to the needs of residents. In addition to its focus on residential and commercial aspects, the Lana project emphasises the improvement of infrastructure within the project and its surroundings. This involves the construction of three to four floors of underground parking to accommodate the residents' vehicles conveniently. Furthermore, there is a comprehensive plan to expand the road network surrounding the project, ensuring smooth transportation and accessibility for both residents and visitors. It is situated just 15 minutes away from the historic Old City of Jerusalem.\n\nTransportation\nPublic transport\nJerusalem is served by highly developed communication infrastructures, making it a leading logistics hub for Israel.\nThe Jerusalem Central Bus Station, located on Jaffa Road, is the busiest bus station in Israel. It is served by Egged Bus Cooperative, which is the second-largest bus company in the world, The Dan serves the Bnei Brak-Jerusalem route along with Egged, and Superbus serves the routes between Jerusalem, Modi'in Illit and Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut. The companies operate from Jerusalem Central Bus Station. Arab neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem and routes between Jerusalem and locations in the West Bank are served by the East Jerusalem Central Bus Station, a transportation hub located near the Old City's Damascus Gate.\n\nRailway\nThe Jerusalem Light Rail initiated service in August 2011. According to plans, the first rail line will be capable of transporting an estimated 200,000 people daily, and has 23 stops. The route is from Pisgat Ze'ev in the north via the Old City and city centre to Mt. Herzl in the south.\n\nA high-speed rail line connecting Tel Aviv to Jerusalem became partially operational in 2018 and was completed in 2019. Its terminus is at the new underground station (80 m or 262 ft deep) serving the International Convention Centre and the Central Bus Station, and is planned to be extended eventually to Malha station. Israel Railways operated train services to Malha train station from Tel Aviv via Beit Shemesh, but this service was discontinued in 2020.\nBegin Expressway is one of Jerusalem's major north–south thoroughfares; it runs on the western side of the city, merging in the north with Route 443, which continues toward Tel Aviv. Route 60 runs through the centre of the city near the Green Line between East and West Jerusalem. Construction is progressing on parts of a 35 km (22 mi) ring road around the city, fostering faster connection between the suburbs. The eastern half of the project was conceptualised decades ago, but reaction to the proposed highway is still mixed.\n\nAirport\nIn the past, Jerusalem was also served by the local Jerusalem International Airport, locally known as Atarot Airport. It was the first airport built in the British Mandate of Palestine. Palestinians considered the Atarot Airport as a \"symbol of Palestinian sovereignty\". The airport falls beyond Green Line. After the 1948 war it came under control of Jordan. Following the Six Day War of 1967, the airport came under control of Israel. With increase of violence in the second intifada, Atarot Airport ceased operation in 2000. Today Jerusalem is served by Ben Gurion Airport, some 50 km (30 mi) northwest of the Jerusalem, on the route to Tel Aviv. The Tel Aviv–Jerusalem railway runs non-stop from Jerusalem–Yitzhak Navon railway station to the airport and began operation in 2018.\nThe Australian businessman Kevin Bermeister proposed a masterplan of Jerusalem, which also includes the development of an airport for Jerusalem in the Jordan Valley, near Jericho. The airport is sought to be a joint Israeli-Palestinian airport. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh have also appealed to Israeli authorities to redevelop the airport. In 2021, the Israeli government planned to redevelop Atarot Airport as a joint Israeli–Palestinian airport. The new Atarot Airport will include two separate Israeli and Palestinian terminals.\n\nEducation\nUniversities\nJerusalem is home to several prestigious universities offering courses in Hebrew, Arabic and English.\n\nFounded in 1925, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has been ranked among the top 100 schools in the world. The Board of Governors has included such prominent Jewish intellectuals as Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. The university has produced several Nobel laureates; recent winners associated with Hebrew University include Avram Hershko, David Gross, and Daniel Kahneman. One of the university's major assets is the Jewish National and University Library, which houses over five million books. The library opened in 1892, over three decades before the university was established, and is one of the world's largest repositories of books on Jewish subjects. Today it is both the central library of the university and the national library of Israel. The Hebrew University operates three campuses in Jerusalem, on Mount Scopus, on Giv'at Ram and a medical campus at the Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital. The Academy of the Hebrew Language are located in the Hebrew university in Givat Ram and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities located near the Presidents House.\nThe Jerusalem College of Technology, founded in 1969, combines training in engineering and other high-tech industries with a Jewish studies programme. It is one of many schools in Jerusalem, from elementary school and up, that combine secular and religious studies. Numerous religious educational institutions and Yeshivot, including some of the most prestigious yeshivas, among them the Brisk, Chevron, Midrash Shmuel and Mir, are based in the city, with the Mir Yeshiva claiming to be the largest. There were nearly 8,000 twelfth-grade students in Hebrew-language schools during the 2003–2004 school year. However, due to the large portion of students in Haredi Jewish frameworks, only fifty-five percent of twelfth graders took matriculation exams (Bagrut) and only thirty-seven percent were eligible to graduate. Unlike public schools, many Haredi schools do not prepare students to take standardised tests. To attract more university students to Jerusalem, the city has begun to offer a special package of financial incentives and housing subsidies to students who rent apartments in downtown Jerusalem.\n\nAl-Quds University was established in 1984 to serve as a flagship university for the Arab and Palestinian peoples. It describes itself as the \"only Arab university in Jerusalem\". Bard College of Annandale-on-Hudson, New York and Al-Quds University agreed to open a joint college in a building originally built to house the Palestinian Legislative Council and Yasser Arafat's office. The college gives Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. Al-Quds University resides southeast of the city proper on a 190,000 m2 (47-acre) Abu Dis campus. Other campuses of AQU are located within city limits of Jerusalem. A campus of university in Sheikh Jarrah, which is one of the oldest faculties, is known as Hind Al Husseini College for Arts. It was named after Hind al-Husseini, a Palestinian activists known for rescuing orphaned survivors of Deir Yassin massacre and giving them shelter in a palace of her grandfather, which was converted into an orphanage and later a college, which is a part today's Al Quds University. A joint campus of AQU and Bard College is located in Beit Hanina. Bayt Mal Al Qods Acharif Agency, a Moroccan organisation, is constructing a new campus in the same neighbourhood.\nOther institutions of higher learning in Jerusalem are the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance and Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, whose buildings are located on the campuses of the Hebrew University.\n\nArab schools\nIsrael's public schools for Arabs in Jerusalem and other parts of the country have been criticised for offering a lower quality education than those catering to Israeli Jewish students. While many schools in the heavily Arab East Jerusalem are filled to capacity and there have been complaints of overcrowding, the Jerusalem Municipality is building over a dozen new schools in the city's Arab neighbourhoods. Schools in Ras el-Amud and Umm Lison opened in 2008. In March 2007 the Israeli government approved a five-year plan to build 8,000 new classrooms in the city, 40 percent in the Arab sector and 28 percent in the Haredi sector. A budget of 4.6 billion shekels was allocated for this project. In 2008, Jewish British philanthropists donated $3 million for the construction of schools for Arabs in East Jerusalem. Arab high school students take the Bagrut matriculation exams, so that much of their curriculum parallels that of other Israeli high schools and includes certain Jewish subjects.\n\nCulture\nAlthough Jerusalem is known primarily for its religious significance, the city is also home to many artistic and cultural venues. The Israel Museum attracts nearly one million visitors a year, approximately one-third of them tourists. The 8 ha (20-acre) museum complex comprises several buildings featuring special exhibits and extensive collections of Judaica, archaeological findings, and Israeli and European art. The Dead Sea scrolls, discovered in the mid-20th century in the Qumran Caves near the Dead Sea, are housed in the Museum's Shrine of the Book. The Youth Wing, which mounts changing exhibits and runs an extensive art education programme, is visited by 100,000 children a year. The museum has a large outdoor sculpture garden and includes the Holyland Model of Jerusalem, a scale-model of the city during the late Second Temple period. The Ticho House in downtown Jerusalem houses the paintings of Anna Ticho and the Judaica collections of her husband, an ophthalmologist who opened Jerusalem's first eye clinic in this building in 1912.\n\nNext to the Israel Museum is the Bible Lands Museum, near The National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel, which includes the Israel Antiquities Authority offices. A World Bible Centre is planned to be built adjacent to Mount Zion at a site called the \"Bible Hill\". A planned World Kabbalah Centre is to be located on the nearby promenade, overlooking the Old City. The Rockefeller Museum, located in East Jerusalem, was the first archaeological museum in the Middle East. It was built in 1938 during the British Mandate. In 2006, a 38 km (24 mi) Jerusalem Trail was opened, a hiking trail that goes to many cultural sites and national parks in and around Jerusalem. The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo has ranked consistently as Israel's top tourist attraction for Israelis. The national cemetery of Israel is located at the city's western edge, near the Jerusalem Forest on Mount Herzl. The western extension of Mount Herzl is the Mount of Remembrance, where the main Holocaust museum of Israel is located. Yad Vashem, Israel's national memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, houses the world's largest library of Holocaust-related information. It houses an estimated 100,000 books and articles. The complex contains a state-of-the-art museum that explores the genocide of the Jews through exhibits that focus on the personal stories of individuals and families killed in the Holocaust. An art gallery featuring the work of artists who perished is also present. Further, Yad Vashem commemorates the 1.5 million Jewish children murdered by the Nazis, and honours the Righteous among the Nations.\n\nThe Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, established in the 1940s, has appeared around the world. The International Convention Centre (Binyanei HaUma) near the entrance to city houses the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. The Jerusalem Cinemateque, the Gerard Behar Centre (formerly Beit Ha'Am) in downtown Jerusalem, the Jerusalem Music Centre in Yemin Moshe, and the Targ Music Centre in Ein Kerem also present the arts. The Israel Festival, featuring indoor and outdoor performances by local and international singers, concerts, plays, and street theatre has been held annually since 1961, and Jerusalem has been the major organiser of this event. The Jerusalem Theatre in the Talbiya neighbourhood hosts over 150 concerts a year, as well as theatre and dance companies and performing artists from overseas. The Khan Theatre, located in a caravanserai opposite the old Jerusalem train station, is the city's only repertoire theatre. The station itself has become a venue for cultural events in recent years as the site of Shav'ua Hasefer (an annual week-long book fair) and outdoor music performances. The Jerusalem Film Festival is held annually, screening Israeli and international films. In 1974 the Jerusalem Cinematheque was founded. In 1981 it was moved to a new building on Hebron Road near the Valley of Hinnom and the Old City.\nJerusalem was declared the Capital of Arab Culture in 2009. Jerusalem is home to the Palestinian National Theatre, which engages in cultural preservation as well as innovation, working to rekindle Palestinian interest in the arts. The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music sponsors the Palestine Youth Orchestra which toured Arab states of the Persian Gulf and other Middle East countries in 2009. The Islamic Museum on the Temple Mount, established in 1923, houses many Islamic artefacts, from tiny kohl flasks and rare manuscripts to giant marble columns. Al-Hoash, established in 2004, is a gallery for the preservation of Palestinian art. While Israel approves and financially supports some Arab cultural activities, Arab Capital of Culture events were banned because they were sponsored by the Palestine National Authority. In 2009 a four-day culture festival was held in the Beit 'Anan suburb of Jerusalem, attended by more than 15,000 people\nPalestinian cinema is based in the city. Jerusalem has been location for \"Jerusalem Arab Film Festival\", for exhibiting Palestinian films. The city is home to numerous artists, singers, actors, actresses and filmmakers. Established in 1991, Riwaq have been working on various projects to restore cultural and historical sites across Palestine. Difficulties to operate in the annexed areas of Palestinian Jerusalem, it have successfully worked across those neighbourhoods, rural and suburban area and Jerusalem Mountains (Jibal al-Quds), where the Palestinian government has control. So far, the organisation have restored a number of sites across the neighbourhoods of Kafr 'Aqab, Al Jib, Jaba and Qalandia. Those restored structures serves as local community centres, cultural sites and headquarters of several NGOs and cultural groups. Yabous Cultural Center is the largest cultural centre in the city, opened by Palestinian groups in 1997. Edward Said National Conservatory of Music have a branch in Jerusalem.\nHadassah Medical Center and the Hebrew University have unveiled a \"Tree of Peace\" statue at the Al Quds University School of Dental Medicine. The Museum on the Seam, which explores issues of coexistence through art, is situated on the road dividing eastern and western Jerusalem. The Abraham Fund and the Jerusalem Intercultural Centre (JICC) promote joint Jewish-Palestinian cultural projects. The Jerusalem Centre for Middle Eastern Music and Dance is open to Arabs and Jews and offers workshops on Jewish-Arab dialogue through the arts. The Jewish-Arab Youth Orchestra performs both European classical and Middle Eastern music. In 2008 the Tolerance Monument, an outdoor sculpture by Czesław Dźwigaj, was erected on a hill between Jewish Armon HaNetziv and Arab Jebl Mukaber as a symbol of Jerusalem's quest for peace.\n\nMedia\nThe headquarters of the Israel Broadcasting Authority and its successor Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation are located in Jerusalem, as well as television and radio studios for Channel 12, Channel 13, and part of the radio studios of BBC News. The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel are also headquartered in Jerusalem. Local newspapers include the Israeli Kol Ha'ir and the Palestinian Jerusalem Times. God TV, an international Christian television network, is also based in the city. PYALARA, an organisation based in Jerusalem, transformed Jaba into a digital hub, which is the Middle East's first digital village and is also home to the first Media Interactive Learning Center in the Middle East.\n\nSports\nThe two most popular sports are football (soccer) and basketball. Beitar Jerusalem Football Club is one of the most well known in Israel. Fans include political figures who often attend its games. Jerusalem's other major football team, and one of Beitar's top rivals, is Hapoel Jerusalem F.C. Whereas Beitar has been Israel State Cup champion seven times, Hapoel has won the Cup only once. Beitar has won the top league six times, while Hapoel has never succeeded. Beitar plays in the more prestigious Ligat HaAl, while Hapoel is in the second division Liga Leumit. Since its opening in 1992, Teddy Stadium has been Jerusalem's primary football stadium, with a capacity of 31,733.\nThe most popular Palestinian football club is Jabal Al Mukaber (since 1976) which plays in West Bank Premier League. The club hails from Mount Scopus at Jerusalem, part of the Asian Football Confederation, and plays at the Faisal Al-Husseini International Stadium at Al-Ram, across the West Bank Barrier.\nIn basketball Hapoel Jerusalem is one of the top teams in the top division. The club has won Israel's championship in 2015, the State Cup four times, and the ULEB Cup in 2004.\nThe Jerusalem Marathon, established in 2011, is an international marathon race held annually in Jerusalem in the month of March. The full 42-kilometre race begins at the Knesset, passes through Mount Scopus and the Old City's Armenian Quarter, and concludes at Sacher Park.

      "summary": "Jerusalem is a city in the Southern Levant, on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Both Israel and Palestine claim Jerusalem as their capital city; Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there, while Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power. Neither claim is widely recognised internationally.\nThroughout its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. During the Canaanite period (14th century BCE) Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning \"City of Shalem\" after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 10th century BCE (Iron Age II), and by the 9th century BCE the city had developed into the religious and administrative centre of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538 the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today those walls define the Old City, which since the 19th century has been divided into four quarters—the Armenian, Christian, Jewish and Muslim quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2023 Jerusalem had a population of 1,028,366. In 2022 60% were Jews and almost 40% were Palestinians. In 2020 the population was 951,100, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353,800 (37.2%), Christians 16,300 (1.7%) and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son King Solomon commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Israelites branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous—and later monotheistic—religion centred on El/Yahweh. These foundational events assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city (Hebrew: עיר הקודש, romanized: 'Ir ha-Qodesh) was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians adopted as the Old Testament, was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection there. Meanwhile, in Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. The city was the first standard direction for Muslim prayers, and in Islamic tradition, Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he spoke to God, per the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only 0.9 km2 (3⁄8 sq mi), the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nAt present, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, Jerusalem was to be \"established as a corpus separatum under a special international regime\" administered by the United Nations. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas incorporated into Israel, while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was occupied and annexed by Jordan. Israel occupied East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into the city's municipality, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residences of the prime minister and president, and the Supreme Court. The international community rejects the annexation as illegal and regards East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.",

      "content": "القُدْس هي اكبر مدن فِلسْطِين المحتلّه مساحهً وسكانًا واكثرها اهميه دينيًا واقتصاديًا. تُعرف باسماء اخرى في اللغه العربيه مثل: بيت المقدس، القدس الشريف، اولى القبلتين، وفي الكتاب المقدس باسم اورشليم، وتسميها اسرائيل رسمياً: اورشليم القدس.\nيعتبرها العرب والفلسطينيون وقطاع عريض من داعمي القضيه الفلسطينيه، عاصمهَ دوله فلسطين المستقبليه بعد التحرير، كما ورد في وثيقه اعلان الاستقلال الفلسطينيه التي صدرت في الجزائر بتاريخ 15 نوفمبر سنه 1988م، (اما تاريخياً كون اجدادهم اليبوسيين تاريخياً، اول من بنى المدينه وسكنها في الالف الخامس ق.م). فيما تعتبرها اسرائيل عاصمتها الموحده، اثر ضمها الجزء الشرقي من المدينه عام 1980م، والذي احتلته بعد حرب سنه 1967 (يعتبرها اليهود عاصمتهم الدينيه والوطنيه لاكثر من 3000 سنه). اما الامم المتحده والمجتمع الدولي، فلا يعترف بالقدس عاصمه لاسرائيل، ويعتبر القدس الشرقيه جزءاً من الاراضي الفلسطينيه، ولا يعترف بضمها للدوله العبريه، مع بعض الاستثناءات. تقع القدس ضمن سلسله جبال الخليل وتتوسط المنطقه الواقعه بين البحر المتوسط والطرف الشمالي للبحر الميت، وقد نمت هذه المدينه وتوسعت حدودها كثيرًا عما كانت عليه في العصور السابقه.\nتُعتبر القدس مدينه مقدسه عند اتباع الديانات الابراهيميه الثلاث الرئيسيه: اليهوديه، المسيحيه، الاسلام. فبالنسبه لليهود، اصبحت المدينه اقدس المواقع بعد ان فتحها النبي والملك داود وجعل منها عاصمه مملكه اسرائيل الموحده حوالي سنه 1000 ق.م، ثم اقدم ابنه سليمان، على بناء اول هيكل فيها، كما تنص التوراه. وعند المسيحيين، اصبحت المدينه موقعًا مقدسًا، بعد ان صُلب يسوع المسيح على احدى تلالها المسماه «جلجثه» حوالي سنه 30 للميلاد، وبعد ان عثرت القديسه هيلانه على الصليب الذي عُلّق عليه بداخل المدينه بعد حوالي 300 سنه، وفقًا لما جاء في العهد الجديد. اما عند المسلمين، فالقدس هي ثالث اقدس المدن بعد مكه والمدينه المنوره، وهي اولى القبلتين، حيث كان المسلمون يتوجهون اليها في صلاتهم بعد ان فُرضت عليهم حوالي سنه 610 للميلاد، وهي ايضًا تمثل الموقع الذي عرج منه نبي الاسلام محمد بن عبد الله الى السماء وفقًا للمعتقد الاسلامي. وكنتيجه لهذه الاهميه الدينيه العظمى، تحوي المدينه القديمه عددًا من المعالم الدينيه ذات الاهميه الكبرى، مثل: كنيسه القيامه، حائط البراق والمسجد الاقصى - المكون من عده معالم مقدسه اهمها مسجد قبه الصخره والمسجد القبلي، على الرغم من ان مساحتها تصل الى 0.9 كيلومترات مربعه (0.35 اميال مربعه).\nخلال تاريخها الطويل، تعرضت القدس للتدمير مرتين، وحوصرت 23 مره، وهوجمت 52 مره، وتمّ غزوها وفقدانها مجددًا 44 مره. استوطن البشر الموقع الذي شُيدت به المدينه منذ الالفيه الرابعه ق.م، الامر الذي يجعل من القدس احدى اقدم المدن الماهوله في العالم. تُصنّف المدينه القديمه على انها موقع تراث عالمي، وقد جرت العاده والعرف على تقسيمها الى 4 حارات، الا ان الاسماء المستخدمه اليوم لكل حاره من هذه الحارات: حاره الارمن، حاره النصارى، حاره الشرف (او حاره اليهود)، وحاره المسلمين، لم تظهر الا في اوائل القرن التاسع عشر. رشحت الاردن المدينه القديمه لتُدرج ضمن قائمه مواقع التراث العالمي المهدده في سنه 1982.\nيُعتبر النزاع القائم حول وضع القدس مسالهً محوريه في الصراع العربي الاسرائيلي. اقدمت الحكومه الاسرائيليه بعد حرب سنه 1967 بين الجيوش العربيه والاسرائيليه على احتلال القدس الشرقيه التي كانت تتبع الاردن، والحقتها باسرائيل واعتبرتها جزءاً لا يتجزا منها، الا ان المجتمع الدولي باغلبيته، لم يعترف بهذا الضم، وما زال ينظر الى القدس الشرقيه على انها منطقه متنازع عليها ويدعو بين الحين والاخر الى حل هذه القضيه عن طريق اجراء مفاوضات سلميّه بين اسرائيل والفلسطينيين. كذلك، فان اغلبيه الدول في العالم لا تعترف بالقدس عاصمه لاسرائيل، لذا فان معظم السفارات والقنصليات الاجنبيه تقع في مدينه تل ابيب وضواحيها. طالب الفلسطينيون -وما زالوا- بالقدس الشرقيه عاصمهً لدوله فلسطينيه، منذ ان احتلها الاسرائيليون، الا ان البرلمان الاسرائيلي اقرّ في 31 يوليو سنه 1980 «قانون اساس: القدس عاصمه اسرائيل»، الذي جعل اعلان القدس، بالحدود التي رسمتها الحكومه الاسرائيليه عام 1967، مبداً دستوريًا في القانون الاسرائيلي. رد مجلس الامن بقرارين، رقم 476 ورقم 478 سنه 1980 وجه اللوم الى اسرائيل بسبب اقرار هذا القانون واكد انه يخالف القانون الدولي، وليس من شانه ان يمنع استمرار سريان اتفاقيه جنيف الرابعه لسنه 1949 على الجزء الشرقي من القدس، كما ويفترض ان تكون المدينه ضمن محافظه القدس التابعه لدوله فلسطين. ادارت منظمه التحرير الفلسطينيه مركزًا لها في بيت الشرق بالقدس الا انه اغلق في سنه 2001 بامر من وزاره الداخليه الاسرائيليه.\nتقع معظم الادارات الحكوميه الاسرائيليه في القدس الغربيه، وهي تشمل: البرلمان الاسرائيلي او الكنيست، مقريّ رئيس الوزراء ورئيس الدوله، والمحكمه العليا. القدس ايضًا هي مقر الجامعه العبريه ومتحف اسرائيل ومزار الكتاب، وفيها ايضًا حديقه الحيوان الكتابيه، التي تُصنّف على انها جاذب هام في السياحه الداخليه، واستاد تيدي الذي يُعتبر احد اهم واكبر ملاعب كره القدم في اسرائيل.\n\nالتسميه\nاوّل اسم ثابت لمدينه القدس هو «اورسالم» الذي يظهر في رسائل تل العمارنه المصريه، ويعني اسس سالم؛ وسالم او شالم هو اسم الاله الكنعاني حامي المدينه، وقيل مدينه السلام. وقد ظهرت هذه التسميه مرتين في الوثائق المصريه القديمه: حوالي سنه 2000 ق.م و1330 ق.م، ثم ما لبثت تلك المدينه، وفقًا لسفر الملوك الثاني، ان اخذت اسم «يبوس» نسبه الى اليبوسيين، المتفرعين من الكنعانيين، وقد بنوا قلعتها والتي تعني بالكنعانيه مرتفع. تذكر مصادر تاريخيه عن الملك اليبوسي «ملكي صادق» انه هو اول من بنى يبوس او القدس، وكان محبًا للسلام، حتى اُطلق عليه «ملك السلام» ومن هنا جاء اسم المدينه وقد قيل انه هو من سماها باورسالم اي «مدينه سالم».\nظهر الاسم «اورشليم» اوّل ما ظهر في الكتاب المقدس، وفي سفر يشوع تحديدًا، ويقول الخبراء اللغويون انه نحت، اي دمج، لكلمتيّ اور، التي تعني «موقع مخصص لعباده الله وخدمته»، والجذر اللغوي س ل م، الذي يعني على ما يُعتقد «سلام»، او يشير الى اله كنعاني قديم اسمه «شاليم»، وهو اله الغسق. اطلق العبرانيون على اقدم الاقسام الماهوله من المدينه اسميّ «مدينه داود» و«صهيون»، وقد اصبحت هذه الاسماء القاب ونعوت للمدينه ككل فيما بعد بحسب التقليد اليهودي. حُرّف اسم القدس من قبل الاغريق خلال العصر الهيليني، فاصبح يُلفظ «هيروسليما» (باليونانيه: Ἱεροσόλυμα)، وعند سيطره الامبراطوريه الرومانيه على حوض البحر المتوسط، اطلق الرومان على المدينه تسميه «مستعمره ايليا الكاپيتولينيّه» (باللاتينيه: Colonia Aelia Capitolina) سنه 131 للميلاد. في بعض الرسائل الاسلاميه باللغه العربيه من القرون الوسطى، وخصوصًا في العهده العمريه، تذكر المدينه باسم «ايلياء» او «ايليا» وهو على ما يبدو اختصار لاسمها اللاتيني. ذُكرت المدينه في فتره لاحقه من القرون الوسطى باسم «بيت المقدس»، وهو ماخوذ من الاراميه בית מקדשא بمعنى «الكنيس». ولا يزال هذا الاسم يُستخدم في بعض اللغات مثل اللغه الارديه، وهو مصدر لقب «مقدسي» الذي يطلق على سكان المدينه.\nاما اسم القدس الشائع اليوم في العربيه وخاصه لدى المسلمين فقد يكون اختصارًا لاسم «بيت المقدس» او لعباره «مدينه القدس» وكثيرًا ما يُقال «القدس الشريف» لتاكيد قدسيه المدينه. اما السلطات الاسرائيليه فتشير في اعلاناتها الى المدينه باسم «اورشليم القدس».\n\nتاريخ القدس\nنظره شامله\nتلعب القدس دورًا اساسيًا عند الحديث عن القوميه العربيه عمومًا والوطنيه الفلسطينيه خصوصًا، وكذلك بالنسبه للقوميه الاسرائيليه او الصهيونيه، لذا فان الحديث عن تاريخها الطويل، الذي يمتد لاكثر من 5,000 سنه، غالبًا ما ياخذ منحى متحيزًا من الناحيه الايديولوجيه. فعلى سبيل المثال، يُركز القوميون الاسرائيليون على الحقبه التاريخيه التي استوطن فيها بنو اسرائيل ارض فلسطين ويزعمون بان جميع يهود العالم اليوم ينحدرون من اولئك القوم الى جانب المكابيين، مما يدعم قضيتهم الهادفه الى توطين يهود العالم في فلسطين ويعزز من موقفهم امام الشعوب المختلفه، حيث يُظهرون انهم الورثه الشرعيين للمدينه والبلاد ككل. ومن ناحيه اخرى، يُركز القوميون العرب والفلسطينيين على الحقبتين المسيحيه والاسلاميه وغيرها من الحقبات غير الاسرائيليه في تاريخ المدينه، مما يدعم قضيتهم التي تقول بان الفلسطينيين الحاليين هم ورثه المدينه والبلاد بما انهم ينحدرون من جميع الشعوب والامم التي سكنت القدس وفلسطين عبر العصور وتزاوجت واختلطت. وكنتيجه لهذا التباين، يزعم كل من الاسرائيليين والفلسطينيين ان الطرف الاخر يُحرّف التاريخ لتحقيق مصالحه الخاصه والقضاء على مصالح الاخر، ولتاييد ادعائه باحقيته بالمدينه، وبطبيعه الحال فان كل طرف وجد المؤيدين لرايه، واغلبهم من ذات القوميه، والمعارضين، واغلبهم من القوميه الاخرى.\n\nالعهد الكنعاني\nاظهرت بعض التنقيبات الاثريه وجود بعض الاواني الخزفيه في مدينه داود، الواقعه ضمن حدود القدس حاليًا، والتي تعود لحوالي الالفيه الرابعه قبل الميلاد، اي منذ العصر النحاسي، واظهرت اكتشافات اخرى وجود مستعمره بشريه قامت خلال اوائل العصر البرونزي (ما بين عاميّ 3000 و2800 ق.م تقريبًا)، ويقول بعض المؤرخين ان من اسسها هم الكنعانيون الذين سكنوا فلسطين في الالف الثالث قبل الميلاد، وخلال هذه الفتره قدم اليها العرب الساميون في هجرتين كبيرتين: الاولى في بدايه الالف الثالث قبل الميلاد، والثانيه في بدايه الالف الثاني قبل الميلاد، بينما يقول اخرون، مثل عالمه الاثار البريطانيه كاتلين كينيون، ان القدس تاسست على يد قوم ساميين شماليين غربيين حوالي سنه 2600 قبل الميلاد. ورد اول ذكر لتجمع سكاني في موقع القدس في رسائل اللعنه الفرعونيه من القرن الثامن عشر قبل الميلاد، ويُذكر موقع القدس فيها باسم اشمام كاحد تجمعات العدو الذي يجب لعنه كي لا يضر بالجيوش المصريه.\nتنص التوراه على ان المدينه تاسست على يد سام بن نوح، وعابر حفيد سام، من اسلاف النبي ابراهيم (وهو ابو الانبياء جميعا وجدهم)، وسكنها في ذلك الوقت شعب يُعرف بشعب اليبوسيين، فسُميت المدينه «يبوس» تيمنًا بسكانها. ازدهرت المدينه في عهد ملكي صادق، وهو احد ملوك اليبوسيين خلال فتره بعثه ابراهيم، واستمر الوضع كما هو الى حين عهد يشوع، عندما دخلت المدينه في نطاق الاراضي الخاضعه لبني بنيامين، يشوع 28/18] الا انها استمرت ماهوله باليبوسيين بعد ان لم يتمكن بنو بنيامين من طردهم. سيطر الملك والنبي داود على المدينه حوالي سنه 1000 ق.م، بعد ان احتلها من اليبوسيين، وجعل منها عاصمه لمملكته. اظهرت اعمال التنقيب مؤخرًا وجود اساسات حجريه ضخمه في وسط القدس، قال الاسرائيليون بانها بقايا هيكل داود، وقد توقفت اعمال التنقيب بعد ان صرّح الخبراء باعتقادهم هذا، الى حين ان يتم التصديق على هذا الامر من قبل مفسري التوراه.\n\nعهد الهياكل\nتنص المخطوطات العبرانيه على ان النبي داود دام حكمه لمملكه اسرائيل 40 عامًا، وبالتحديد حتى سنه 970 ق.م، وبعد وفاته خلفه ولده سليمان الذي حكم طيله 33 عامًا، وفي عهده تمّ تشييد هيكل المدينه على جبل موريا، بالاضافه الى هيكل سليمان الشهير، الذي يلعب دورًا مهمًا عند اليهود، كونه يمثل المستودع الذي حُفظ فيه تابوت العهد وفقًا للمعتقد اليهودي. اصبحت القدس تُسمى بالمدينه المقدسه في عام 975 ق.م، وشكّلت عاصمه لمملكه اسرائيل الموحده، وبعد وفاه سليمان انقسمت المملكه الى قسمين شمالي وجنوبي وذلك بعد تمرد الاسباط العبريه الشماليه بسبط يهوذا الجنوبي الذي كان ال داود ينتمون اليه. سُمي القسم الجنوبي بمملكه يهوذا في الجنوب، واصبحت القدس عاصمه لها تحت قياده رحبعام بن سليمان. وفي سنه 587 ق.م، احتل الملك البابلي «نبوخذ نصّر الثاني» مدينه القدس بعد ان هزم اخر ملوك اليهود «صدقيا بن يوشيا»، ونقل من بقي فيها من اليهود اسرى الى بابل بمن فيهم الملك صدقيا نفسه، وعاث في المدينه دمارًا وخرابًا واقدم على تدمير هيكل سليمان، مما انهى الفتره التي يُطلق عليها المؤرخون تسميه «عهد الهيكل الاول».\n\nبعد 50 سنه من السبي الى بابل، سمح الملك الفارسي قورش الكبير عام 538 ق.م لمن اراد من اسرى اليهود في بابل بالعوده الى القدس واعاده بناء الهيكل المهدم، فعاد عدد من اليهود الى القدس وشرعوا ببناء الهيكل الثاني، وانتهوا من العمل به سنه 516 ق.م، في عهد الملك الفارسي دارا الاول، وعُرف فيما بعد بمعبد حيرود تيمنًا بملك اليهود حيرود الكبير الذي قام بتوسيعه. وحوالي سنه 445 ق.م، اصدر الملك الفارسي «ارتحشستا الاول» مرسومًا سمح فيه لسكان المدينه باعاده بناء اسوارها، واستمرت المدينه عاصمه لمملكه يهوذا طيله العقود التي تلت. فقدت الامبراطوريه الفارسيه فلسطين بما فيها القدس لصالح القائد والملك المقدوني، الاسكندر الاكبر، عام 333 ق.م، وبعد وفاته استمر خلفاؤه المقدونيون البطالمه في حكم المدينه، واستولى عليها في العام نفسه بطليموس الاول وضمها مع فلسطين الى مملكته في مصر عام 323 ق.م. ثم في عام 198 ق.م، خسر بطليموس الخامس القدس ومملكه يهوذا لصالح السلوقيين في سوريا، بقياده انطيوخوس الثالث الكبير. حاول الاغريق ان يطبعوا المدينه بطابعهم الخاص ويجعلوا منها مدينه هيلينيه تقليديه، لكن هذه المحاوله باءت بالفشل سنه 168 ق.م، عندما قام المكابيين بثوره على الحاكم انطيوخوس الرابع، تحت قياده كبير الكهنه «متياس» وابنائه الخمسه، ونجحوا بتاسيس المملكه الحشمونائيميه وعاصمتها القدس سنه 152 ق.م. استولى قائد الجيش الروماني «پومپيوس الكبير»، على القدس في عام 63 ق.م بعد ان استغل صراعًا على سدّه المُلك بين الملوك الحشمونائيميه، وبهذا ضُمت القدس الى الجمهوريه الرومانيه.\n\nالحروب اليهوديه الرومانيه\nاقدم الرومان على تنصيب حيرود الاول ملكًا على اليهود ليضمنوا سيطرتهم وتحكمهم بمملكه يهوذا، فكرّس حيرود عهده لتجميل المدينه وتطوير مرافقها، فبنى عددًا من الاسوار والقصور والابراج والقلاع، وقام بتوسيع المعبد حتى تضاعف حجم المنطقه حيث يقع. وبعد وفاه حيرود الاول في السنه السادسه قبل الميلاد، خلفه حيرود الثاني في حكم القدس من عام 4 قبل الميلاد حتى 6 بعده وعندها اخضع الرومان مملكه يهوذا للحكم الروماني المباشر نتيجه لعدم ثقه الحكومه بحيرود، فاصبحت تُعرف بمقاطعه اليهوديه، على الرغم من ان خلفاء حيرود الاول، المتحدرين من اغريباس الثاني، استمروا بحكم المناطق المجاوره بوصفهم ملوك تابعين لروما حتى سنه 96 ميلاديه.\nشهد الحكم الروماني المباشر للقدس حوادث كثيره، اولها الثوره اليهوديه الكبرى، التي استمرت من سنه 66 الى سنه 70م، حيث قام اليهود في القدس باعمال شغب وعصيان مدني قمعها الحاكم الروماني «تيطس» بالقوه فاحرق المدينه واسر كثيراً من اليهود ودُمّر المعبد للمره الثانيه، وعادت الامور الى طبيعتها في ظل الاحتلال الروماني للمدينه المقدسه. ثم عاود اليهود التمرد واعلان العصيان مرتين في عاميّ 115 و132م، والمره الاخيره عُرفت بثوره شمعون بن كوكبه، تيمنًا بقائد العصيان، وخلالها تمكن اليهود بالفعل من السيطره على المدينه، واعلنوها عاصمه لمملكه يهوذا مجددًا، الا ان الامبراطور الروماني «هادريان» تعامل مع الثوّار بعنف واسفر ذلك عن تدمير القدس للمره الثانيه، واخرج اليهود المقيمين فيها ولم يبق الا المسيحيين، ومن شدّه نقمه الامبراطور على اليهود، اصدر مرسومًا بجعل المدينه ذات طابع روماني فتم تغيير اسمها الى «مستعمره ايليا الكاپيتولينيّه» واشترط الا يسكنها يهودي، بل اقدم على تغيير اسم مقاطعه اليهوديه بكاملها وجعله «مقاطعه سوريا الفلسطينيه» (باللاتينيه: Syria Palaestina) تيمنًا بالفلستينيون الذين سكنوا الساحل الجنوبي الكنعانيون.\n\nخضعت المدينه لسيطره الرومان ثم الروم البيزنطيين خلال القرون الخمسه التي تلت ثوره شمعون بن كوكبه، وبعد ان نقل الامبراطور الروماني قسطنطين الاول عاصمه الامبراطوريه الرومانيه من روما الى بيزنطيه، واعلن المسيحيه ديانه رسميه للدوله، امر بتشييد عدد من المعالم المسيحيه بالقدس، فبنيت كنيسه القيامه عام 326م، فكانت تلك نقطه تحول بالنسبه للمسيحيين في المدينه، حيث لم يعودوا مضطهدين، واستطاعوا ممارسه شعائرهم الدينيه بحريّه. اصبحت القدس مركزًا لبطريركيه من البطريركيات الخمس الكبرى، وهي الى جانب القدس: الاسكندريه وروما والقسطنطينيه وانطاكيه، بعد ان تقرر انشائها في مجمع نيقيه. استمرت القدس بالنمو والاتساع منذ ان انتهى عهد الهيكل الثاني بعد تدمير الاخير، حيث بلغت مساحتها كيلومترين مربعين (0.8 اميال مربعه.) ووصل عدد سكانها الى حوالي 200,000 نسمه. استمر حظر دخول اليهود الى القدس طيله عهد قسطنطين الاول حتى القرن السابع الميلادي.\n\nحروب الروم والفرس\nانقسمت الامبراطوريه الرومانيه عام 395م الى قسمين متناحرين: الامبراطوريه الغربيه وعاصمتها روما، والامبراطوريه الشرقيه او البيزنطيه وعاصمتها القسطنطينيه، وخضعت القدس مع باقي بلاد الشام الى الامبراطوريه الاخيره. شجع الانقسام الروماني الفرس على الاغاره على القدس، فامر شاه الامبراطوريه الساسانيه، كسرى الثاني، قائدا جيوشه «شهربراز» و«شاهين»، بالسير الى سوريا واستخلاص القدس من ايدي الروم، ففعلا ما طُلب منهما ونجحا في احتلالها، خصوصًا بعد ان ساعدهم اليهود في فلسطين، الذين كانوا ناقمين على البيزنطيين.\nفتح الفرس المدينه في سنه 614م، بعد حصار استمر 21 يومًا. تنص السجلات البيزنطيه ان الفرس واليهود ذبحوا الاف المسيحيين من سكان القدس، وما زال هذا الامر موضع جدال بين المؤرخين، حيث قال البعض بصحته ونفاه البعض الاخر. استمرت المدينه خاضعه للفرس طيله 15 سنه، الى ان استطاع الروم استعادتها سنه 629م تحت قياده الامبراطور هرقل، وظلت بايديهم حتى الفتح الاسلامي عام 636م.\nيؤمن المسلمون انه خلال هذه الفتره، وبالتحديد في عام 621م تقريبًا، شهدت القدس زياره النبي محمد، حيث اسرى به الملاك جبريل ليلاً من المسجد الحرام الى المسجد الاقصى ثم صعد الى السماوات العلى حيث راى الانبياء والرسل السابقين وعاد بعد ان خاطب الله الذي علّمه عدد الصلوات المفروضه على الانسان، وبهذا الحدث، اصبحت القدس ثالث اقدس الاماكن عند المسلمين.\n\nالفتح الاسلامي\nاصبحت القدس مدينه مقدسه بالنسبه للمسلمين بعد حادثه الاسراء والمعراج، وبعد ان فُرضت الصلاه على المسلمين، اصبحوا يتوجهون اثناء اقامتها نحو المدينه، وبعد حوالي 16 شهرًا، عاد المسلمون ليتوجهوا في صلاتهم نحو مكه بدلاً من القدس، بسبب كثره تعيير اليهود للنبي محمد وللمسلمين بسبب استقبالهم لقبله اليهود، ولاسباب اخرى.\n\nفي عهد عمر بن الخطاب والفتوحات الاسلاميه، اُرسل عمرو بن العاص وابو عبيده بن الجراح لفتح فلسطين عامه ونشر الدعوه الاسلاميه فيها، لكن القدس عصيت عليهم ولم يتمكنوا من فتحها لمناعه اسوارها، حيث اعتصم اهلها داخل الاسوار. وعندما طال حصار المسلمين لها، طلب رئيس البطاركه والاساقفه، المدعو «صفرونيوس»، طلب منهم ان لا يسلم القدس الا للخليفه عمر بن الخطاب بشخصه. فارسل عمرو بن العاص يخبر عمر في المدينه بما طلبه صفرونيوس رئيس الاساقفه المسيحيين في القدس فاستشار الخليفه عمر بن الخطاب اصحابه فكان اول من تكلم عثمان بن عفان فقال: «اقم ولا تسر اليهم فاذا راوا انك بامرهم مستخفن ولقتالهم مستحقر فلا يلبثون الا اليسير حتى ينزلوا على الصغار ويعطوا الجزيه». وقال علي بن ابي طالب: «اني ارى انك ان سرت اليهم فتح الله هذه المدينه على يديك وكان في مسيرك الاجر العظيم». ففرح عمر بن الخطاب بمشوره علي فقال: «لقد احسن عثمان النظر في المكيده للعدو واحسن علي المشوره للمسلمين فجزاهما الله خيراً ولست اخذاً الا بمشوره علي فما عرفناه الا محمود المشوره ميمون الغره».\nفقصد عمر بن الخطاب وخادمه ومعهما ناقه الى بيت المقدس في رحله شاقه. وما ان وصلا مشارف القدس حتى اطل عليهما صفرونيوس والبطاركه وسالوا من هذين الرجلين فقال المسلمون انه عمر بن الخطاب وخادمه، فسال ايهما عمر فقيل ذاك الواقف على قدميه اذ كان خادمه ممتطيا الناقه فذهلوا بهذا لانه مذكور في كتبهم، فكان الفتح العمري لبيت المقدس. كتب عمر مع المسيحيين وثيقهً عُرفت باسم «العهده العمريه» وهي وثيقه منحتهم الحريه الدينيه مقابل الجزيه، وتعهد بالحفاظ على ممتلكاتهم ومقدساتهم، وعرض صفرونيوس على عمر بن الخطاب ان يؤدي الصلاه في كنيسه القيامه بعد ان حان موعدها اثناء زيارته لها، فخرج من الكنيسه وصلى على مبعده منها وعاد. ولمّا ساله البطريرك صفرونيوس عن السبب اجابه انه يخاف من ان يتخذ المسلمون من فعله ذريعه فيما بعد للسيطره على الكنيسه فيقولون من بعده «ها هنا صلّى عمر» وبالتالي يحولون الكنيسه الى مسجد للمسلمين. سمح المسلمون لليهود بالرجوع للسكن في المدينه بعد فتحها، وطبقوا عليهم ما طبقوه على المسيحيين من حمايه لمقدساتهم مقابل الجزيه. اقام المسلمون مسجدًا في الموقع الذي صلّى به عمر بن الخطاب، بالقرب من مدخل كنيسه القيامه اليوم، وقال الاسقف الغالي «اركولف» الذي عاش في القدس من سنه 679 حتى سنه 688، ان مسجد عمر كان مبنًى خشبيًا مربع الشكل بُني على انقاض بعض المباني والمنشات، وكان يتسع لحوالي 3,000 مصل.\n\nقام عمر بن الخطاب بعد فتح المدينه بالبحث عن مكان المسجد الاقصى المذكور في القران والصخره المقدسه واضعًا نصب عينيه الروايه التي سمعها من محمد ليله الاسراء، وسال الصحابه وكعب الاحبار، وهو من اليهود الذين اسلموا، والبطريرك صفرنيوس، وكان عمر بن الخطاب يراجع المرافقين له حين يدلونه على مكان لا يجد اوصافه تنطبق على ما لديه قائلاً: «لقد وصف لي رسول الله صلّى الله عليه وسلم المسجد بصفه ما هي عليه هذه». وقد عثر الخليفه على مكان المسجد الاقصى والصخره المقدسه في وقت قصير، وكان المكان مطموراً بالاتربه التي تكاد تخفي معالمه. وامر عمر بن الخطاب باقامه مسجد موضع المسجد الاول، واقامه ظله من الخشب فوق الصخره المقدسه، وعندما جاء الخليفه الاموي عبد الملك بن مروان بنى قبه الصخره فوق الصخره المقدسه عام 691، ثم بنى الخليفه الوليد بن عبد الملك الجامع القبلي عام 709. يقول المؤرخ من القرن العاشر، محمد بن احمد شمس الدين المقدسي، ان عبد الملك بن مروان بنى قبه الصخره وجعل منها ذهبيه كي تطغى على قبب الكنائس المنتشره في القدس، ولتصبح معلمًا بارزًا يلفت نظر الزائر اوّل ما يراها. اهتم الامويون والعباسيون بالمدينه فشهدت نهضه علميه في مختلف الميادين، لكن شهرتها سرعان ما تضعضعت بسبب عدم الاستقرار الذي شهدته الدوله العباسيه وانقسامها الى دويلات عديده.\n\nعهد الصليبيين، الايوبيين، والمماليك\nادّى تفكك الدوله العباسيه الى دويلات متناحره الى ضعف العمل بالشريعه الاسلاميه من قبل بعض الحكّام، فلقي المسيحيون كثيرًا من الاضطهاد، وهُدمت كنيسه القيامه في القدس خلال عهد الخليفه الفاطمي، ابو علي منصور الحاكم بامر الله، وتعرّضت حياه الحجاج الاوروبيين للخطر. وعندما سقطت القدس بقبضه الاتراك السلاجقه سنه 1076، ازدادت الحاله سوءًا وكثر التعدي على الحجاج الاوروبيين بشكل خاص بسبب ما كانوا يحملونه معهم من النفائس والاموال، فكانت تلك احدى الاسباب التي ادّت لنشوب الحروب الصليبيه. انطلق الصليبيون في حملتهم الاولى سنه 1095 متوجهين الى مدينه القدس، فوصلوها في سنه 1099 وضربوا الحصار عليها فسقطت في ايديهم بعد شهر من الحصار، وقتل الصليبيون فور دخولهم القدس قرابه 70 الفًا من المسلمين واليهود وانتهكوا مقدساتهم، وقامت في القدس منذ ذلك التاريخ مملكه لاتينيه تُحكم من قبل ملك كاثوليكي فرض الشعائر الكاثوليكيه على المسيحيين الارثوذكس مما اثار غضبهم.\n\nاستطاع صلاح الدين الايوبي استرداد القدس من الصليبيين عام 1187 بعد معركه حطين، وعامل اهلها معامله طيبه، وازال الصليب عن قبه الصخره، ودعا اليهود والمسلمين ليعودوا الى المدينه، واهتم بعمارتها وتحصينها. ولكن الصليبيين نجحوا في السيطره على المدينه بعد وفاه صلاح الدين في عهد الامبراطور فريدريش الاول بربروسا امبراطور الامبراطوريه الرومانيه المقدسه، وكانت القدس في هذه الفتره قد ضعف شانها وافل نجمها واصبحت مجرّد قريه عاديّه نظرًا لتراجع اهميتها الاستراتيجيه، خصوصًا بسبب انهماك اولاد صلاح الدين بالنزاع فيما بينهم، وعدم تركيزهم على محاربه الصليبيين. ظلت القدس بايدي الصليبيين 11 عامًا الى ان استردها نهائياً الملك الصالح نجم الدين ايوب عام 1244.\nتعرضت المدينه لغزو التتار الخوارزميين عام 1244، الذين قضوا على القسم الاعظم من سكانها المسيحيين وطردوا اليهود منهم. هُزم التتار على يد المماليك بقياده سيف الدين قطز والظاهر بيبرس في معركه عين جالوت عام 1259، وضمت فلسطين بما فيها القدس الى السلطنه المملوكيه التي حكمت مصر والشام بعد الدوله الايوبيه حتى عام 1517. وخلال هذه الفتره تعرّضت المدينه والمنطقه ككل لسلسله من الزلازل وتفشّى فيها وباء الطاعون الاسود.\n\nالعهد العثماني\nدخلت جيوش العثمانيين فلسطين بقياده السلطان سليم الاول بعد معركه مرج دابق في سنه 1517، واصبحت القدس مدينه تابعه للدوله العثمانيه طيله 400 سنه حتى سقوطها بيد قوّات الحلفاء في الحرب العالميه الاولى سنه 1917. تمتعت القدس بعهد من الرخاء والازدهار خلال عهد السلطان سليمان الاول \"القانوني\"، خليفه سليم الاول، حيث اعاد الاخير بناء اسوار المدينه وقبه الصخره. استمرت القدس خلال معظم العهد العثماني مجرّد مدينه محلّيه عاديه ولم يعلوا شانها التجاري او الثقافي بشكل يُذكر، لكنها بقيت من ضمن المدن العثمانيه المهمه نظرًا لمكانتها الدينيه. تطوّرت الحياه المقدسيّه بشكل ملحوظ خلال القرن التاسع عشر بعد ان انشات السلطات العثمانيه عدد من المرافق الحديثه لتسهيل حياه الناس، فافتتح مركز للبريد وانشات خطوط سير نظاميه مخصصه لمركبات الجياد العموميه، واُنيرت الشوارع بالمصابيح الزيتيّه، وفي اواسط القرن سالف الذكر انشا العثمانيون اوّل طريق معبّده بين القدس ويافا، وبحلول عام 1892، كانت المدينه موصوله بغيرها من المدن الشاميّه والحجازيه بسكه حديديه.\nخلال الفتره الممتده من عام 1831 حتى عام 1840، اصبحت فلسطين جزءًا من الدوله المصريه التي اقامها محمد علي باشا، وخلال هذا العهد اخذت الارساليات والقنصليات الاجنبيه تضع موطئ قدم لها في المدينه. وفي سنه 1836، سمح ابراهيم باشا بن محمد علي، سمح لليهود ان يعيدوا انشاء اربعه معابد رئيسيّه، ومن ضمنها كنيس الخراب. ثار الشوام على الحكم المصري بعد ان استقر في البلاد لاسباب مختلفه منها زياده الضرائب بمقدار لم يعهده الناس ايام العثمانيين والتجنيد الاجباري في الجيش المصري، وكان من ضمن هذه الثورات ثوره قامت في سنه 1834 بفلسطين بقياده قاسم الاحمد، الذي قاد جيشًا من الثوّار من مدينه نابلس تعاونه عشائر بلده ابو غوش، وهاجم القدس ودخلها بتاريخ 31 مايو 1834، لكن الجيش المصري استطاع ان يرد الثوّار على اعقابهم في الشهر التالي.\nعادت القدس الى الحكم العثماني بعد هزيمه المصريين امام الجيوش الحليفه العثمانيه والاوروبيه سنه 1840، الا ان كثيرًا من المصريين بقي واستقر بالمدينه، وفي نفس الفتره قدمت وفود من اليهود والمسلمين المغاربه، من مدينه الجزائر وغيرها من مدن المغرب العربي، واستقرت في القدس. اخذت القوى العظمى في العالم تتدخل في الشؤون الداخليه العثمانيه بشكل متزايد خلال عقد الاربعينيات والخمسينيات من القرن التاسع عشر، بحجه حمايه الاقليات الدينيه في الدوله العثمانيه، وقد لعب القناصله في القدس دورًا كبيرًا في هذه المساله. افاد القنصل البروسي بالقدس ان عدد سكان المدينه في سنه 1845 وصل الى 16,410 نسمه، منهم 7,120 يهودي، 5,000 مسلم، 3,390 مسيحي، 800 جندي تركي، و100 شخص اوروبي. ارتفعت نسبه الحجاج المسيحيين في المدينه خلال العهد العثماني، الامر الذي كان يجعل جمهره المسيحيين بالقدس تتضاعف في حجمها خلال موسم الفصح.\n\nاخذت المنازل تظهر خارج اسوار القدس خلال عقد الستينيات من القرن التاسع عشر، بعد ان ازداد عدد سكان المدينه بفعل المهاجرين، ولاقامه منشات اكثر صحيّه مخصصه لاستضافه الحجاج المسيحيين، خصوصًا وان كثيرًا منهم كان يشتكي من الاكتظاظ السكاني داخل المدينه ومن رداءه نظام الصرف الصحي. ومن المنشات المهمه التي برزت خلال هذه الفتره، المجمّع الروسي سنه 1860، الذي خُصص لاستقبال وايواء الحجاج الروس الارثوذكس. قدّرت احدى احصائيات ارساليه امريكيه عدد سكان القدس سنه 1867 «باكثر من» 15,000 نسمه، 6,000 منهم مسلمين، وما بين 4,000 الى 5,000 منهم يهود، كذلك تبيّن ان عدد الحجاج الروس كان يتراوح بين 5,000 الى 6,000 حاج كل عام. انشات الدوله العثمانيه عام 1880 متصرفيه القدس، وازيل الحائط القديم للمدينه عام 1898 لتسهيل دخول القيصر الالماني ڤيلهلم الثاني وحاشيته اثناء زيارته للقدس. وظلت المدينه تحت الحكم العثماني حتى هزمت الدوله العثمانيه في الحرب العالميه الاولى.\n\nالانتداب البريطاني وحرب سنه 1948\nسقطت القدس بيد الجيش البريطاني بقياده الفريق اول ادموند النبي في سنه 1917، بعد ان تقهقر الجيش العثماني مهزومًا امامهم، وفي سنه 1922 منحت عصبه الامم بريطانيا حق الانتداب على فلسطين واماره شرق الاردن والعراق، واصبحت القدس عاصمه فلسطين تحت الانتداب البريطاني.\nدخلت المدينه في عهد جديد كان من ابرز سماته زياده اعداد المهاجرين اليهود اليها خاصه بعد وعد بلفور الذي اصدرته الحكومه البريطانيه، وقد اظهرت بعض احصائيات تلك الفتره ان عدد سكان المدينه ارتفع من 52,000 نسمه عام 1922 الى 165,000 نسمه عام 1948 بفعل هجره اليهود. ادّى ازدياد عدد اليهود في فلسطين عمومًا والقدس خصوصًا، وشرائهم للاراضي ومساعده البريطانيين لهم، ادّى الى استياء المقدسيين من مسلمين ومسيحيين، فقامت اعمال شغب في سنتيّ 1920 و1929، وعُرفت الاخيره بثوره البراق، قُتل خلالها عدد من اليهود. عمل البريطانيون على اخماد هذه الثورات، وساهموا في جعل اليهود يستقرون في المدينه عن طريق بنائهم لاحياء سكنيّه كامله في شمال وغرب المدينه، وانشائهم لعدد من مؤسسات التعليم العالي، مثل الجامعه العبريه.\nاحيلت قضيه القدس الى الامم المتحده بعد الحرب العالميه الثانيه، فاصدرت الهيئه الدوليه قرارها في 29 نوفمبر سنه 1947 بتدويل القدس تحت رعايتها واشرافها. وجاء في القرار انه سوف يُطبّق طيله 10 سنوات، ويشمل مدينه بيت لحم، وانه بعد هذه الفتره سيتم اجراء استفتاء عام لتحديد نظام الحكم الذي يرغب اغلبيه سكان المدينه بتطبيقه عليهم. الا ان تطبيق هذا القرار لم يُكتب له ان يتم، فبعد ان اعلنت بريطانيا في عام 1948 انهاء الانتداب في فلسطين وسحب قواتها، استغلت العصابات اليهوديه حاله الفراغ السياسي والعسكري واعلنت قيام الدوله الاسرائيليه، فثار العرب عمومًا والفلسطينيون خصوصًا واعلنوا الحرب على اسرائيل، فهوجمت المدينه من قبل الجيش العربي والثوّار الفلسطينيين، وقُتل عدد من الاسرائيليين في هذا الهجوم وتم اسر البعض الاخر. كذلك هاجم القنّاصه العرب القسم الغربي من المدينه.\n\nالتقسيم والضم\nكان من نتائج حرب سنه 1948 بين العرب والاسرائيليين ان قُسمت القدس الى شطرين: الجزء الغربي الخاضع لاسرائيل، والجزء الشرقي الخاضع للاردن. وفي شهر نوفمبر من نفس السنه، اقيمت منطقه عازله بين الجزئين، حيث قابل قائد القوّات الاسرائيليه في القدس، موشيه دايان، نظيره الاردني عبد الله التل في احدى منازل حيّ مصراره بالقدس، وقاما بتعليم الحدود الفاصله بين شطريّ المدينه، حيث لوّنت حصه اسرائيل باللون الاحمر وحصه الاردن باللون الاخضر. نجم هذا اللقاء عن رسم خريطه لحدود غير رسميّه بين الطرفين المتحاربين، لكنها اخذت بعين الاعتبار عند توقيع اتفاقيه الهدنه بين اسرائيل ولبنان ومصر والاردن وسوريا سنه 1949، والتي اتفقت فيها تلك الدول على وقف اطلاق النار والتزام الاسرائيليين بالبقاء ضمن هذه الحدود لحين ايجاد حل سلمي للنزاع. كذلك نصّت هذه الاتفاقيه على تقسيم القدس على ان يبقى جبل المشارف في يد اسرائيل على الرغم من انه يقع في القسم الشرقي، بوصفه جيب داخلي. بناءً على هذا، اقيمت الحواجز الاسمنتيّه والاسلاك الشائكه في وسط المدينه ومرّت بالقرب من باب الخليل في الجانب الغربي من البلده القديمه، واُنشات نقطه عبور شمال الاخيره عُرفت بمعبر ماندلباوم. استمرت بعض المناوشات العسكريه بين الاردن واسرائيل بين الحين والاخر على الرغم من اتفاق وقف اطلاق النار، الا انها لم تكن ذات اهميه تُذكر غالبًا. كان داود بن گوريون، رئيس وزراء اسرائيل، قد اعلن في 3 ديسمبر 1948 ان القدس الغربيه عاصمه للدوله الاسرائيليه الوليده، وفي سنه 1950 اعلن الاردن رسميًا خضوع القدس الشرقيه للسياده الاردنيه، وقد اعترفت المملكه المتحده وباكستان بهذا الضم، فيما لم تعترف دول اخرى بهذا الامر بحجه ان القدس الشرقيه خضعت للاردن بحكم الامر الواقع وليس بشكل رسمي، ويشكك البعض ان كانت باكستان قد اعترفت بضم الاردن للقدس الشرقيه حتى.\nخضعت اغلبيه المواقع المقدسه في القدس للسياده الاردنيه، بما ان اغلبها يقع في القسم الشرقي من المدينه، فاجرت الحكومه الاردنيه عدد من الاصلاحات والترميمات لقبه الصخره والمسجد الاقصى، وسمحت للمسيحيين الاجانب بزياره المقدسات المسيحيه شرط خضوعهم للرقابه، اما اليهود فلم يُسمح لهم بدخول المدينه لاعتبارات سياسيه، حيث كانت الحكومه تخشى ان يعمل بعضهم في الجاسوسيه لصالح اسرائيل.\n\nخاض العرب واسرائيل حربًا اخرى في سنه 1967 انتصرت فيها الاخيره، وقامت بالسيطره على القدس الشرقيه، وكان من نتيجه ذلك ان عاد اليهود ليدخلوا دون اي قيود الى اماكنهم المقدسه، كذلك ازيلت القيود المفروضه على المسيحيين الغربيين، اما المسجد الاقصى وقبه الصخره فاستمرا خاضعين للاوقاف الاسلاميه. قام الاسرائيليون بهدم حاره المغاربه بعد دخولهم المدينه، بما انها كانت تواجه حائط البراق الذي يتعبّد اليهود عنده، ولكي يجعلوا من الموقع ساحه لرفع الصلاه اليهوديه. قامت اسرائيل بتوسيع حدود المدينه بعد انتهاء الحرب وذلك عبر بناء عدد من الاحياء السكنيه والمستعمرات اليهوديه شرق الخط الاخضر، وقد اقدمت اسرائيل منذ سنه 1967 بمحاولات عديده تهدف الى تهويد المناطق التي احتلتها بعد الحرب، وذلك عبر وسائل عديده، منها التركيز الاعلامي على اهميه المواقع الاثريه العبرانيه في المدينه.\nقوبل ضم اسرائيل للقدس الشرقيه بالاستنكار الدولي، وبعد ان اصدرت اسرائيل قانون اساس اعتبرت فيه القدس الموحده عاصمه ابديه للبلاد، اصدر مجلس امن الامم المتحده القرار رقم 478 الذي نص على ان اسرائيل خرقت قانونًا دوليًا وطالب جميع الدول الاعضاء بسحب ما تبقى من سفاراتها من القدس. ما زالت مساله القدس تُشكل قضيه محوريه في الصراع العربي الاسرائيلي، خصوصًا مع اقرار الحكومه الاسرائيليه بناء وحدات استيطانيه جديده على الدوام في حارات واحياء في البلده القديمه يسكنها مسلمون وتحوي مقدسات اسلاميه، في سبيل رفع عدد اليهود في القدس الشرقيه، الا ان علماء الدين المسلمون وعدد من المؤرخين العرب يزعمون ان اليهود ليس لهم اي حق في المدينه لاسباب متنوعه، منها ان حائط البراق الذي بُني منذ حوالي 2,500 سنه كان جزءًا من مسجد سليمان الذي تسميه اليهود هيكل سليمان. طالب الفلسطينيون وما زالوا بالقدس الشرقيه عاصمه للدوله الفلسطينيه المستقبليه، لذا لطالما كانت حدود المدينه موضع نقاش وجدال في المحادثات الثنائيه بين السلطه الفلسطينيه واسرائيل. اقام بعض الاشخاص من الفلسطينيين والاسرائيليين الراغبين بالسلام نصبًا تذكاريًا مصنوع من الاسلحه القديمه الباليه، يواجه سور القدس القديم ونقشوا عليه عبارات بالعربيه والعبريه مقتبسه من سفر اشعياء.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع مدينه القدس في وسط فلسطين تقريبًا شرق البحر المتوسط، على رعن هضبه من هضاب جبال الخليل، التي تضم عددًا من الجبال بدورها، وهي: جبل الزيتون او جبل الطور شرق المدينه، جبل المشارف ويقع الى الشمال الغربي للمدينه، ويُقال له ايضًا «جبل المشهد»، وقد اقيمت فوقه في سنه 1925 الجامعه العبريه، ومستشفى هداسا الجامعي في سنه 1939، جبل صهيون ويقع الى الجنوب الغربي وتكوّن البلده القديمه جزءًا كبيرًا منه وتمر اسوارها من فوقه، جبل المكبر الذي سُمي بهذا الاسم عندما دخل عمر بن الخطاب القدس وكبّر على متنه، بالاضافه الى جبل النبي صموئيل، وجبل ابو غنيم. ترتفع القدس عن سطح البحر المتوسط نحو 750 مترًا (2,460 قدمًا)، وعن سطح البحر الميت نحو 1150 مترًا (3,770 قدمًا). بالاضافه الى جبال القدس فان هناك ثلاثه اوديه تحيط بها وهي: وادي سلوان او وادي جهنم واسمه القديم «وادي قدرون»، الوادي او الواد، وادي الجوز، ونبع ام الدرج.\nكانت القدس محاطه بغابات من اشجار الجوز الزيتون الصنوبر منذ القدم، الا ان الحروب والاستغلال البشري كان لها وقعٌ مدمّر عليها، فاختفت معظم هذه الغابات، وقد اثّر ذلك على تماسك التربه، فاضطر المزارعون الى تشييد المدرّجات الزراعيه على عدد من السفوح لمنع تاكلها وانجراف تربتها. شكّل شح المياه مشكله للمقدسيين منذ العهود الاولى لاستيطان المدينه، فقاموا بتشييد عدد من القناطر والقنوات لجرّ مياه الانهار، اضافه لعدد من البرك والابار لجمع ماء الامطار، وما زال البعض منها موجودًا بالبلده القديمه. ومن ابرز ابار المدينه بئر ايوب، نسبه الى النبي ايوب، وهذه البئر هي التي يؤمن المسلمون انها ذُكرت في القران بسوره ص، حيث جاء: ﴿ارْكُضْ بِرِجْلِكَ هَذَا مُغْتَسَلٌ بَارِدٌ وَشَرَابٌ﴾، كذلك من ابرز بركها او عيونها، العين المعروفه بعين سلوان، وهي احدى العيون الجاريه التي يؤمن المسلمون انها ذُكرت في القران ايضًا في سوره الرحمن: ﴿فِيهِمَا عَيْنَانِ تَجْرِيَانِ﴾. قال مجير الدين الحنبلي عن القدس في نهايه القرن التاسع سنه 900 هـ: \n\nتبعد القدس نحو 60 كيلومترًا (37 ميلاً) عن البحر المتوسط، وحوالي 35 كيلومترًا (22 ميلاً) عن البحر الميت، و250 كيلومتر (155 ميلاً) عن البحر الاحمر، وتبعد عن عمّان 88 كيلومتر (55 ميلاً)، وعن بيروت 388 كيلومتر (241 ميلاً)، وعن دمشق 290 كيلومتر (180 ميلاً). اما المدن والبلدات المجاوره للقدس فتشمل: بيت لحم وبيت جالا جنوبًا، ابو ديس ومستوطنه معاليه ادوميم شرقًا، مڤاسرت صهيون غربًا، ورام الله ومستوطنه گفعات زئيف شمالاً.\n\nمناطق القدس\nتمتد اراضي بلديه القدس اليوم لتشمل مناطق شاسعه كانت في السابق قرى او ضواحي للمدينه، فتشمل حدود البلديه كل من: بيت حنينا، كفر عقب، شعفاط، التل الفرنسي، جبل المشارف، الشيخ جراح، وادي الجوز، جبل الزيتون، البلده القديمه، سلوان، العيسويه، راس العمود، ابو الطور، جبل المكبر، صور باهر، ام طوبا، جبل ابو غنيم، بيت صفافا والولجه، قائمه المدن والقرى في فلسطين التاريخيه.\nمن جهه اخرى، اقامت اسرائيل العديد من المستوطنات، كما قامت بضم مستوطنات قديمه اخرى خارج حدود البلديه بعد احتلالها للقدس الشرقيه عام 1967 وبنائها لجدار الفصل عام 2002، والذي عزل العديد من البلدات العربيه عن القدس، كالعيزريه، ابو ديس، الرام، حزما، عناتا، السواحره الشرقيه، بيت اكسا، الشيخ سعد وقلنديا - حيث مطار القدس الدولي، والتي من المفترض ان تشكل الامتداد الطبيعي لتوسع الاحياء العربيه في المدينه مستقبلاً. وهذه المستوطنات هي: مستوطنه عطروت، مستوطنه نيڤيه يعقوب، مستوطنه بيسغات زئيف، مستوطنه رامات اشكول، مستوطنه غيلو، مستوطنه هماطوس ومستوطنه ناليبوت مزراح.\nالقدس الغربيه\nاقدمت اسرائيل بعد قيامها عام 1948، على تدمير معظم القرى الواقعه غرب القدس، من اهمها: المالحه، دير ياسين، عين كارم، لفتا، والقسطل. واقامت مكانها العديد من المستوطنات التي اصبحت تشكل فيما بعد مناطق القدس الغربيه، وهي: گفعات شاؤول، بيت هيكرم، جبل هرتزل، كريات هيوفيل، عميق زيفائيم، يمين موشيه، ربحاميا، نحلاؤوت، محانيه يهودا، مئه سيعاريم، روميما وگفعات رام.\n\nالحياه البريه والغابات\nيقع في محيط القدس عده غابات ومناطق بريه مثل وادي الغزال، تقع هذه المنطقه بوسط القدس بالقرب من حي «گفعات مردخاي» اليهودي،\nوهي ارض مكشوفه تبلغ مساحتها 260 دونمًا. اُطلق هذا الاسم على الوادي كون ما يُقارب من 17 غزالاً جبليًا تتخذ منه موطنًا ولا تستطيع مغادرته لاحاطه المدينه به من مختلف الجوانب. كان متعهدو العقارات والمقاولون قد خططوا لتحويل المنطقه الى منطقه سكنيه، لكن محبي الطبيعه وجمعيه حمايه البيئه في اسرائيل استطاعت ايقاف هذا الامر، وارغام السلطات المختصه على النظر في مساله حمايه الموقع.\n\nالمناخ\nتتميز القدس بمناخ البحر الابيض المتوسط (تصنيف كوبن للمناخ: Csa)، مع صيف حار جاف، وشتاء مُعتدل البروده رطب. تتساقط الثلوج عادهً مره او مرتين خلال الشتاء، على الرغم من ان المدينه تختبر تساقطًا كثيفًا للثلوج مره كل ثلاث الى اربع سنوات، في المتوسط، مع تراكم قصير العمر.\nيُعتبر يناير ابرد شهور السنه، بمتوسط درجه حراره 9.1 درجه °مئويه (48.4 درجه °فهرنهايت)؛ يُعد شهري يوليو واغسطس الاكثر سخونه، حيث يبلغ متوسط درجه الحراره 24.2 درجه °مئويه (75.6 درجه °فهرنهايت)، وعاده ما تكون اشهر الصيف جافه. يبلغ متوسط هطول الامطار السنوي حوالي 537 مليمترًا (21 انشًا)، وذلك في الفتره الممتده بين شهريّ اكتوبر ومايو، اما الاشهر الاخرى فينعدم فيها تساقط الامطار غالبًا. تساقط الثلوج ليس شائعًا، لكن تساقط الثلوج بغزاره يعتبر نادرًا. تلقت القدس اكثر من 30 سم (12 بوصه) من الثلج في 13 ديسمبر 2013، والتي شلت المدينه تقريبًا. مع متوسط درجات حراره في الصيف مماثله للسواحل، فان التاثير البحري من البحر الابيض المتوسط قوي، لا سيما بالنظر الى ان القدس تقع على خط عرض مشابه للصحاري الحاره غير البعيده الى الشرق.\nكانت اعلى درجه حراره مُسجله في القدس 44.4 درجه °مئويه (111.9 درجه °فهرنهايت) في 28 و30 اغسطس 1881، وكانت ادنى درجه حراره مُسجله −6.7 درجه °مئويه (19.9 درجه °فهرنهايت) في 25 يناير 1907.\nياتي معظم تلوث الهواء في القدس من حركه مرور السيارات. لم يتم بناء العديد من الشوارع الرئيسيه في القدس لاستيعاب هذا الحجم الكبير من حركه المرور، مما ادى الى ازدحام حركه المرور والمزيد من انبعاثات اول اكسيد الكربون في الهواء. تُساهم انبعاثات المصانع بنسبه ضئيله من تلوّث الهواء بالمدينه، الا انه يمكن لتلك الصادره عن المصانع الواقعه على ساحل البحر المتوسط ان تتجه شرقًا ناحيه القدس وتُشكل ضبخانًا فوقها.\n\nالقرى\nقرى القدس عديده وكثيره فقد اختلف التحاق بعض القرى لمدينه القدس وفقًا للتغيرات التاريخيه التي مرت بها المدينه. كان اخر تغيير لحدود مدينه القدس الاداريه في يونيو سنه 1967 بموجب قرار اصدرته الحكومه الاسرائيليه بعد احتلال الضفه الغربيه من الاردن. نص هذا القرار على ضم 70,4 كيلومترات مربعه الى منطقه البلديه المقدسيه الاسرائيليه وفرض القانون الاسرائيلي عليها. كانت 6,4 كيلومترات مربعه من المساحه المضمومه تابعه للبلديه المقدسيه الاردنيه قبل حرب سنه 1967، اما الباقي فكان من اراضي بعض القرى المجاوره للقدس. اقدم الاسرائيليون على هدم عدد من القرى الفلسطينيه وبناء قرىً ومستوطنات جديده على انقاضها، وقد سمحت الحكومه في وقت لاحق لبعض المهجرين من الفلسطينيين بالعوده الى قراهم، فاقاموا بجانب المستوطنات قرىً جديده. حاز سكان المنطقه المضمومه على مكانه «مقيم دائم» في اسرائيل، دون ان يحصلوا على المواطنه، اما القرى التي بقيت خارج حدود القدس الاداريه وسكانها، فيخضعون لسيطره الحكم العسكري او لسيطره السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه. وكانت الحكومه الاسرائيليه قد اصدرت قانون املاك الغائب عام 1950، الذي منح اسرائيل صفه الوصي على على املاك الفلسطينيين الغائبين، واعطاها الحق في الاستيلاء عليها وادارتها. من القرى العربيه التي كانت بجوار القدس من جانبها الغربي قبل حرب سنه 1948 لم تبق الا ثلاثًا: ابو غوش (اكبرها)، عين رافه، وعين نقوبا. تعتبر هذه القرى الثلاثه اليوم تجمعات عربيه اسرائيليه وسكانها ذوي جنسيه اسرائيليه. ومن قرى القدس الاخرى: اشوع، البريج، بيت ام الميس، بيت عطاب، بيت محسير، جرش، خربه العمور، خربه اللوز، دير الشيخ، وغيرها.\n\nالتركيبه السكانيّه\nاشارت الاحصاءات الاسرائيليه الرسميه الصادره نهايه عام 2000 الى انّ تعداد السكان في المدينه ارتفع بنسبه 2% من اجمالي السكان البالغ 646,3 الف نسمه، بينهم 436,7 الف يهودي بنسبه 67,6%، في حين بلغ عدد السكان العرب 209,5 الاف عربي بنسبه 32.4%. وقد تبيّن في احصائيه اخرى من نفس السنه ان نسبه السكان من اليهود تتراجع تدريجيًا بينما نسبه العرب في ازدياد مطّرد، ويرجع ذلك الى نسبه الولادات الاعلى عند العرب والى هجره البعض من اليهود الى مدن وبلدان اخرى. كذلك افادت نفس الدراسه ان حوالي 9% من جمهره البلده القديمه البالغه 32,488 نسمه كانوا يهودًا. بلغت نسبه الكثافه السكانيّه بالمدينه في نهايه عام 2005 حوالي 5,750.4 نسمه في الكيلومتر المربّع (14,893.5 نسمه/ميل مربّع)، وفي نهايه سنه 2006 اظهرت احصائيه اعدّتها مؤسسه اسرائيليه للدراسات حول مدينه القدس ان عدد سكان القدس بلغ 733 الف شخص بينهم 481 الف يهودي و252 الف فلسطيني يعيشون خصوصًا في الاحياء الشرقيه من المدينه. وفي شهر ديسمبر من سنه 2007، وصل عدد سكان القدس الى 747,600 نسمه، 64% منهم يهود و32% مسلمين و2% مسيحيين.\n\nيخوض الفلسطينيون والاسرائيليون حربًا ديمغرافيّه في القدس، حيث يسعى كل طرف الى زياده عدد السكان المنتمين الى عرقيته ليضمن هيمنته على المدينه، وتعمل الحكومه الاسرائيليه - كما تقول الدكتوره ساره هيرشكوبيتس رئيسه قسم التخطيط الاستراتيجي في بلديه القدس - على الا تتعدى نسبه العرب بالمدينه 28%. وتحاول الحكومه الاسرائيليه زياده عدد اليهود في المدينه بطرق عده، منها على سبيل المثال العمل على احلال اليهود محلّ العرب الذين هدّمت منازلهم بحجّه البناء دون تصريح. وتشير احصائيات بيت الشرق لعام 1999 في هذا الصدد الى هدم اكثر من الفيْ منزل منذ عام 1967، مما خلق ظروفاً صعبه للفلسطينيين حيث يسكن معظمهم في منازل مكتظه. ومن الوسائل الاخرى التي تتّخذها اسرائيل لاجبار المقدسيّين على الهجره من القدس، عدم منحهم تصاريح بناء الا فيما ندر، وتسهيل بناء المنازل لليهود المهاجرين. وفي سنه 2005، قدم المدينه 2,850 مهاجر يهودي جديد من الولايات المتحده وفرنسا ومن بعض دول الاتحاد السوڤيتي السابق، وبنهايه السنه ذاتها تبيّن ان 16,000 من السكان غادر المدينه، الا ان جمهره المدينه ما زالت في ازدياد بفضل ارتفاع نسبه الانجاب بين الاهالي العرب واليهود الحريديه. يصل معدل الخصوبه الكلي في القدس الى 4.02، وهو اعلى من ذاك الخاص بتل ابيب (1.98) والمعدل الوطني حتى، الذي يصل الى 2.90.\n\nبلغت الزياده الصافيه للسكان في سنه 2000، بعد حساب الولادات والوفيات والمهاجرين من والى المدينه، 12600 نسمه، كان نصيب اليهود منها 2900 نسمه، في حين بلغت الزياده العربيه 9700. وبهذا كانت نسبه نمو السكان اليهود في القدس هي 0.7% بينما كانت عند السكان العرب 4.7%. وفي سنه 2005 ازداد عدد السكان بحوالي 13,000 نسمه، اي قرابه 1.8%، وهي نسبه مشابهه لنسبه معدّل النمو السكاني في اسرائيل في ذلك العام، الا ان ما يميزها هو التباين في التركيبه السكانيّه والعرقيّه، فقرابه 31% من الجمهره اليهوديه تالفت من اولاد دون سن الخامسه عشر، بالمقابل فان هذه النسبه وصلت لحوالي 42% عند السكان العرب، ويتوافق ذلك مع الدراسات التي اظهرت تراجع عدد اليهود في القدس خلال العقود الاربع الماضيه، واتجاه معظمهم الى المدن الساحليه والضواحي.\nعادت نسبه اليهود الحريديه في المدينه الى الارتفاع بحلول عام 2009، حيث تبيّن في احدى الاحصائيات ان 59,900 تلميذ من اصل 150,100، او 40% منهم، يطلبون العلم في المدارس الرسميّه العلمانيّه والدينيّه على حد سواء، بينما 90,200 تلميذ او 60% من المجموع الاصلي، يتلقون دراستهم في مدارس حريديه خاصه.\nيرى العديد من الاسرائيليين ان القدس مدينه فقيره تمزقها النزاعات السياسيه والدينيه، لذا فهم يفضلون سكن مدن اخرى اكثر امانًا وغنى، وبالمقابل تستقطب المدينه عددًا كبيرًا من الفلسطينيين من سكّان الضفه الغربيه وقطاع غزه، كونها تقدم لهم فرص عمل وخدمات صحيه اكبر من تلك المتاحه في مدنهم وقراهم. شجّع الزعماء الفلسطينيون والعرب السكان الفلسطينيين عبر السنين على البقاء في المدينه لتاكيد حقهم بالمطالبه بها، وقد فعل البعض منهم هذا.\n\nمخيم شعفاط\nتاسس مخيم شعفاط للاجئين في عام 1965، اي بعد اكثر من عقد واحد على تاسيس كافه المخيمات الرسميه الاخرى في الضفه الغربيه، وذلك فوق ارض مساحتها 0,2 كيلومتر مربع شمال القدس. وقد تاسس مخيم شعفاط بعد ان تم اغلاق مخيم المعسكر في المدينه القديمه للقدس بسبب سوء الظروف الصحيه فيه.\nوتعود اصول اللاجئين في مخيم المعسكر والذين رُحلوا الى شعفاط الى 55 قريه تابعه لمناطق القدس واللد ويافا والرمله. ومثل باقي مخيمات الضفه الغربيه، فقد تاسس المخيم فوق قطعه من الارض استاجرتها وكاله غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين من الحكومه الاردنيه.\nويُعد مخيم شعفاط المخيم الوحيد في الضفه الغربيه الذي يقع ضمن الحدود البلديه للقدس. ولذلك، فان اللاجئين فيه يحق لهم الحصول على هويات مدنيه تابعه للقدس، الامر الذي يضمن لهم حقوق الاقامه في القدس ويجعلهم مؤهلين للحصول على بعض الخدمات الاجتماعيه الاسرائيليه، بما في ذلك الرعايه الصحيه.\nوفي الوقت الذي تبين سجلات الاونروا الرسميه ان عدد اللاجئين المسجلين في المخيم يصل الى حوالي 11,000 لاجئ، الا انه من المرجح ان يبلغ عدد اللاجئين فيه اكثر من 18,000. ويُقدر ان حوالي 4,000 لاجئ قد انتقلوا الى المخيم في السنوات الاخيره لتجنب فقدان حقوق الاقامه في القدس. ويعمل حوالي 70% من سكان المخيم في القطاع الخاص الاسرائيلي.\n\nتهويد القدس\nتتّبع اسرائيل سياسه دمج المستوطنات لاستيعاب اكبر عدد ممكن من اليهود داخل القدس، فعلى سبيل المثال دمجت الحكومه الاسرائيليه مستوطنه گفعات زئيف ومعاليه ادوميم ومناطق الخط الاخضر لاحتواء حوالي 30 الف مستوطن جديد داخل المدينه. كما بنت 142 الف شقه في القطاع اليهودي لزياده حجم السكان فيها. تفيد احدى تقارير البنك الدولي ان عدد مخالفات البناء في الفتره الممتده بين عاميّ 1996 و2000، كان اكبر باربع مرّات ونصف في الاحياء اليهوديه، وان عمليات الهدم في القدس الغربيه كانت اقل باربع مرّات من تلك الحاصله في القدس الشرقيه؛ كذلك افاد التقرير ان السلطات الاسرائيليه كانت تمنح الفلسطينيين اذونًا بالبناء اقل بكثير من الاذون التي تمنحها لليهود، وان المخالفين الفلسطينيين تُزال مخالفاتهم بنسبه اكبر من مخالفات اليهود. حصلت بعض المؤسسات اليهوديه على اذن من الحكومه الاسرائيليه خلال السنوات القليله الماضيه، يسمح لها بتشييد المباني والمعالم على الاراضي المتنازع عليها، من شاكله «حديقه الملك سليمان» المخطط انشاؤها في قريه سلوان بمدينه داود، والتي يُشكل العرب حوالي 60% من سكانها، وفي مقبره «مامن الله». اطلق معارضو هذه الخطوات المُتخذه من قبل الحكومه الاسرائيليه مصطلح «تهويد القدس» على هذه الاجراءات، كونها تصب في مصلحه اليهود دون الفلسطينيين.\n\nالقدس الرسميه\nالبلديّه\nتاسس المجلس البلدي لمدينه القدس في سنه 1863 ابّان الحكم العثماني، وقد انقسم هذا المجلس الى مجلسين عند تقسيم المدينه. تولت امانه القدس الاهتمام بالقدس العربيه بين نكبه فلسطين واحتلال القدس في حرب 1967.\nيتالّف مجلس بلديّه القدس الاسرائيلي اليوم من 31 عضوًا منتخبًا على راسهم رئيس البلديّه، الذي يُنتخب لخمس سنوات، ويتمتع بحق تعيين سته مفوضين بلديين لينوبوا عنه، وهؤلاء الى جانب رئيس البلديه يتلقون رواتبهم كامله من الحكومه الاسرائيليه، اما باقي الاعضاء فيُعتبر عملهم تطوعيًا. يعقد مجلس بلديه القدس معظم اجتماعاته بصفه سريّه، عدا جلسه واحده في كل شهر تكون علنيّه. تُشكل الاحزاب الدينيه عصبه قويّه داخل مجلس البلديه، حيث تسيطر غالبًا على معظم المقاعد. يقع دار بلديه القدس ومكتب رئيسها في ساحه الصفراء في شارع يافا. يتكوّن مجمّع البلديه، الذي افتتح في سنه 1993، من مبنيين حديثيّ البناء الى جانب عشره مبان قديمه مجدده، تحيط بساحه عامّه واسعه. تتبع المدينه محافظه القدس وتُشكّل عاصمتها. اضافه الى ذلك، تقوم مؤسسه الاقصى لاعمار المقدسات بصيانه وترميم ورعايه المؤسسات والمباني الاسلاميه في القدس.\nقامت بلديه القدس الغربيه في سنه 1949 باجراء مسابقه لتصميم علم للشطر الغربي من المدينه، ففاز تصميم تضمن رسمًا لخطين عريضين باللون الازرق يرمزان الى شال الصلاه اليهوديه، على خلفيه بيضاء يقع في وسطهما شعار المدينه. وجعلت اسرائيل التصميم الاسرائيلي شعارًا للمدينه بشطريها بعد حرب سنه 1967 عندما ضمت القدس الشرقيه، على الرغم من ان السكان العرب والمجتمع الدولي لم يتعرف بذلك، لكن العلم والشعار بقيا بحكم الامر الواقع. صُمم شعار القدس ما بين سنتيّ 1950 و1951، وهو يُظهر اسدًا جامحًا يُرمز به الى اسد يهودا، شعار القبيله اليهوديه القديمه، محاطًا باغصنه زيتون، وفي الخلفيه رُسم حائط البراق. اما السلطه الفلسطينيه فلم تنشئ شعار ولا علم للمدينه.\n\nرؤساء البلديه\nتوالى على رئاسه بلديه القدس عدد من اعيان المدينه، كان اولهم «موسى العلمي». تولّى اليهود رئاسه البلديه لاوّل مره في سنه 1937، وذلك عندما فاز «دانيال استر» برئاسه البلديه بدعم من حكومه الانتداب البريطانيه. وعندما انقسمت القدس الى شطرين، اصبحت هناك بلديتين: بلديه القدس الشرقيه ورئيسها عربي، وبلديه القدس الغربيه ويراسها اسرائيلي. اما اوّل رؤساء بلديه القدس الشرقيه فهو «انور الخطيب»، واوّل رؤساء بلديه القدس الغربيه هو الحاكم العسكري «دوڤ يوسف». وعندما ضمّت اسرائيل القدس الشرقيه بعد حرب حزيران سنه 1967، اسست بلديه «اورشليم القدس» وتولّى رئاستها «ثيودور كولك». يشغل نير بركات منصب رئيس بلديه اورشليم القدس حاليًا، ويراس زكي الغول امانه القدس الشرقيه، بما ان السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه واغلب دول العالم لا تعتبر ضم الاخيره قانونياً.\n\nالوضع السياسي\nبعد ان اصدرت هيئه الامم المتحده قرارها القاضي بتقسيم فلسطين في سنه 1947، نصّت على وجوب تدويل القدس تحت اشرافها ورقابتها، وقد سارع القاده اليهود الى قبول هذا الامر نظرًا لانه يحقق مطامحهم في اقامه دوله لهم، بينما عارضه الزعماء العرب ورفضوا اي تقسيم يُخطط اجراؤه في فلسطين. انقسمت المدينه الى شطرين بعد حرب سنه 1948 بين العرب واسرائيل، واحتلت الاخيره القسم الغربي، فيما سيطر الاردن على القسم الشرقي. اعتبرت معظم الدول، وما زالت، ان وضع القدس ينبغي ان يُحدد كما ورد في قرار التقسيم، لذا فان اغلبها لا يعترف بالقدس عاصمه لاسرائيل.\nبعد ان اعلن دافيد بن غوريون، اوّل رئيس وزراء لاسرائيل، ان القدس الغربيه عاصمه البلاد، اتخذت جميع الهيئات الحكوميه الاسرائيليه، من قضائيه وتشريعيه وتنفيذيه، من المدينه مقرًا لها، عدا وزاره الدفاع، التي لا تزال تتخذ من منطقه كرياه بوسط تل ابيب مركزًا لها. سيطرت اسرائيل على المدينه بشطريها مباشرهً بعد حرب سنه 1967، وجعلت منها جزءًا من العاصمه بحكم الامر الواقع، على الرغم من معارضه المجتمع الدولي لهذا الامر. لا تزال هويّه القدس كعاصمه «ابديّه» لاسرائيل تُشكّل موضع جدل كبير في المجتمع الدولي، فعلى الرغم من ان بعض الدول فتحت قنصليات لها في المدينه، فان جميع السفارات موجوده خارجها، ومعظمها في تل ابيب. وبسبب عدم الاعتراف بالقدس كعاصمه لاسرائيل، فان معظم الصحف العالميه والمحليه تصف اعلانات الحكومه الاسرائيليه بانها «صادره عن تل ابيب».\nاصدر مجلس امن الامم المتحده القرار رقم 478 بتاريخ 20 اغسطس سنه 1980، الذي نصّ على ان قانون الاساس الذي اصدرته اسرائيل واعتبرت فيه القدس عاصمه ابديه لها، قانونًا «فاسدًا باطلاً وينبغي الغاؤه فورًا»، واقتُرح ان تقوم الدول الاعضاء في هذا المجلس بسحب كل هيئاتها الدبلوماسيه من المدينه حتى تذعن اسرائيل للقرار الدولي، وقد استجابت معظم الدول ذات السفارات المتبقيه في القدس لهذا الامر، وقامت بنقل مراكز سفاراتها الى تل ابيب، كما فعلت غيرها من الدول قبيل صدور القرار رقم 478، وكنتيجه لهذا الامر، فرغت القدس من السفارات الاجنبيه، لكن بعضًا منها اتخذ من احدى ضواحيها، وهي «مڤاسرت صهيون»، مقرًا لها، كذلك استمرت 4 قنصليات موجوده بالمدينه. قرر الكونغرس الامريكي نقل مقر السفاره الامريكيه من تل ابيب الى القدس في سنه 1995، وذلك بعد اصدار «قانون السفاره في القدس» (بالانگليزيه: Jerusalem Embassy Act)، الا ان بيل كلنتون، رئيس الولايات المتحده انذاك، استمر بتاجيل التوقيع على هذا القرار الى ان انتهت ولايته، وعندها قال الرئيس الذي خلفه، وهو جورج بوش الابن، قال بان قرارات الكونغرس المتعلقه بوضع القدس ليست الزاميه والهدف منها ابداء النصح والمشوره فقط، فلم يُقدم على توقيع القرار واستمرت السفاره الامريكيه موجوده في تل ابيب. قال امين عام الامم المتحده، بان كي مون، في 28 اكتوبر سنه 2009، بان القدس يجب ان تكون عاصمهً لكل من فلسطين واسرائيل كي يتحقق السلام العادل والشامل.\n\nتقع في القدس ابرز المؤسسات الحكوميه الاسرائيليه، بما فيها البرلمان او الكنيست، والمحكمه العليا، والمقر الرسمي لرئيس الجمهوريه ورئيس الوزراء. وقبيل اعلان قيام «دوله» اسرائيل، كانت القدس عاصمهً اداريه للاراضي الشاميّه الخاضعه للانتداب البريطاني، اي تلك التي تشمل اليوم اراضي السلطه الفلسطينيه واسرائيل والاردن. كانت القدس الغربيه عاصمهً لاسرائيل من سنه 1949 حتى سنه 1967، الا ان دول العالم لم تعترف بهذا الامر بما ان قرار الامم المتحده رقم 194 كان قد نصّ على تدويل المدينه. بعد ان خضعت المدينه بشطريها لاسرائيل بعد حرب سنه 1967، اعلنت حكومه ليڤي اشكول تطبيق القانون الاسرائيلي على القدس الشرقيه وامتداد نطاق اختصاص القضاء الاسرائيلي اليها، لكنها وافقت على خضوع منطقه المسجد الاقصى وقبه الصخره لوزاره الاوقاف الاردنيه. امرت السلطات الاسرائيليه باقفال بيت الشرق، وهو مقرّ منظمه التحرير الفلسطينيه، في سنه 1988 لاسباب امنيّه، وفي سنه 1992 اعيد افتتاح البيت بصفته مضافه. نصّت اتفاقيه اوسلو على ان الوضع النهائي للقدس يجب ان يتحدد عن طريق مفاوضات مع السلطه الفلسطينيه، التي تعتبر القدس الشرقيه عاصمه لدوله فلسطينيه مستقبليه، وقد قال الرئيس الفلسطيني محمود عبّاس ان ايه مفاوضات لا تتضمن الاعتراف بالقدس الشرقيه عاصمه لفلسطين ستكون غير مقبوله. في السادس من ديسمبر 2017 قرر الرئيس الامريكي دونالد ترامب الاعتراف بالقدس عاصمه لاسرائيل ونقل سفاره الولايات المتحده الى القدس.\n\nالاهميه الدينيه\nالقدس مدينه ذات اهميه دينيه كبرى عند اتباع الديانات الابراهيميه الثلاث: اليهود والمسيحيون والمسلمون. اظهرت احدى الاحصائيات من سنه 2000 ان القدس تحوي حاليًا 1204 كنسات، 158 كنيسه، و73 مسجدًا، والبعض من دور العباده هذه يُعتبر من بين اكثر المواقع تقديسًا عند اتباع هذه الديانه او تلك، ان لم يكن اقدسها في بعض الاحيان، لذا فقد كان انتهاك حُرمه احدى هذه الدور من بين الاسباب التي ادّت دومًا الى حصول نزاعات كبيره في المدينه والمنطقه ككل.\n\nفي الاسلام\nالقدس هي ثالث اقدس الاماكن عند المسلمين بعد مكه والمدينه المنوره، وكانت تمثّل قبله الصلاه الاسلاميه طيله ما يُقارب من سنه، قبل ان تتحول القبله الى الكعبه في مكه. وقد اصبحت القدس مدينه ذات اهميّه دينيه عند المسلمين بعد ان اسرى الملاك جبريل بالنبي محمد اليها، وفق المعتقد الاسلامي، قرابه سنه 620 حيث عرج من الصخره المقدسه الى السماوات العلى حيث قابل جميع الانبياء والرسل الذين سبقوه وتلقّى من الله تعاليم الصلاه وكيفيه ادائها. تنص سوره الاسراء ان محمدًا اُسري به من المسجد الحرام الى «المسجد الاقصى»: ﴿سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي اَسْرَى بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلاً مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ اِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الاَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ ايَاتِنَا اِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ﴾؛ وقد اجمع المفسرون على ان المقصود بالمسجد الاقصى مدينه القدس ذاتها، وسُميت الاقصى لبعد المسافه بينها وبين المسجد الحرام، اذ لم يكن حين اذن فيها المسجد الاقصى الحالي. يقع اليوم معلمين اسلاميين في الموقع الذي عرج منه النبي محمد (صلى الله عليه وسلم) الى السماء، وهما قبه الصخره التي تحوي الصخره المقدسه، والمسجد الاقصى الذي بُني خلال العهد الاموي. ومما يجعل من القدس مدينه مهمه في الاسلام ايضًا، ان عددًا كبيرًا من الانبياء والصالحين الذين يتشارك المسلمون واهل الكتاب عمومًا بالايمان بهم، مع اختلاف النظره اليهم، حيث يعتبر المسلمون واليهود ان عدد منهم انبياء او رسل بينما ينظر المسيحيون اليهم بصفتهم قديسين، قطنوا المدينه عبر التاريخ او عبروها، ومنهم داود وسليمان وزكريا ويحيى والمسيح عيسى بن مريم، وكذلك لذكر المدينه في القران بانها وما حولها اراض مباركه شكّلت قبله للانبياء ومهبطًا للملائكه والوحي وان الناس يُحشرون فيها يوم القيامه.\nاما عند الشيعه الاثنا عشريه فالمسجد الاقصى مكانه في السماء الرابعه وليس على الارض فليس للمسجد الاقصى مكانه ذات اهميه لديهم، عن سلام الحناط، عن رجل، عن ابي عبد الله قال: سالته عن المساجد التي لها الفضل فقال: المسجد الحرام ومسجد الرسول، قلت: والمسجد الاقصى جعلت فداك؟ فقال: ذاك في السماء اليه اسري رسول الله صلى الله عليه واله فقلت: ان الناس يقولون: انه بيت المقدس؟ فقال: مسجد الكوفه افضل منه.\n\nفي المسيحيه\nيجلّ المسيحيون القدس لاسباب مختلفه، منها تاريخها الذي ورد ذكره في العهد القديم، اضافه الى لعبها دورًا محوريًا في حياه يسوع المسيح. ينص العهد الجديد ان يسوع اُحضر الى المدينه بعد ولادته بفتره قصيره، وتذكر التقاليد المسيحيه انه قام لاحقًا بتطهير معبد حيرود من الاصنام الرومانيه التي وضعها الملك حيرود داخله، وانه قلب موائد الصيارفه وكراسي باعه الحمام ولم يدع احدًا يجتاز الهيكل بمتاع.\nيؤمن البعض ان العليّه حيث تناول المسيح وتلاميذه العشاء الاخير، تقع على جبل صهيون في ذات المبنى حيث يقع ضريح الملك داود. ومن المواقع المسيحيه المقدسه في المدينه ايضًا، التلّه المعروفه باسم «جلجثه»، وهي موقع صلب يسوع بحسب الايمان المسيحي. يصف انجيل يوحنا هذه التلّه بانها تقع خارج القدس، الا ان بعض الحفريات اظهرت مؤخرًا انها تقع على بُعد مسافه قليله من البلده القديمه داخل حدود المدينه الحاليّه. امّا اقدس الاماكن المسيحيه في القدس فهي كنيسه القيامه، التي يحج اليها المسيحيون من مختلف انحاء العالم منذ حوالي الفيّ سنه، ويقول بعض الخبراء والمؤرخين انها اكثر المواقع احتمالاً بان تكون قد شُيدت على الجلجثه.\n\nفي اليهوديه\nاصبحت المدينه مقدسه عند اليهود بعد ان فتحها النبي والملك داود وجعلها عاصمه مملكه اسرائيل الموحده في القرن العاشر قبل الميلاد. وكانت القدس تحوي الهيكل الذي بناه سليمان بن داود، الذي يسميه اليهود «هيكل سليمان»، بالاضافه الى هيكل او معبد حيرود الذي شُيّد في وقت لاحق بعد ان هُدم الهيكل الاوّل. ورد ذكر هذا الهيكل 632 مرّه في الكتاب المقدس، وما زال اليهود اليوم يتعبدون عند حائط البراق او حائط المبكى، الذي يؤمنون بانه كل ما تبقى من المعبد القديم، ويُشكل هذا الحائط ثاني اقدس الاماكن في اليهوديه بعد «قدس الاقداس».\nتُبنى جميع الكنس في العالم ومحرابها يواجه القدس، اما محاريب كنس القدس فتواجه «قدس الاقداس». تنص التوراه الشفهيه والشريعه اليهوديه ان الصلاه يجب ان تتلى في اتجاه القدس وهيكل حيرود، والكثير من الاسر اليهوديه تضع لويحه «مزراح» على احدى جدران منزلها لتحديد قبله الصلاه. ذُكرت القدس في التناخ 669 مرّه، وذُكر اسم «صهيون» التي يقصد بها اليهود المدينه تاره وفلسطين ككل تاره اخرى، 154 مرّه.\n\nمعالم المدينه\nتعتبر البلده القديمه بحد ذاتها احدى المعالم التاريخيه المقدسيه. تبلغ مساحه القدس القديمه، ضمن الاسوار قرابه كيلومترًا مربعًا ويقع المسجد الاقصى في الناحيه الشرقيه من المدينه واسوارها. وتقسم المدينه الى حارات او خطط، وفي هذه الاحياء اسواق محليه صغيره استقلت عن الاسواق الرئيسه، وكانت الاحياء تضم مجموعات سكانيه منسجمه في بيئتها الاجتماعيه والدينيه، وطرق المدينه القديمه متعرجه، غُطي بعضها بعقود، وقد تقوم منشات او امتدادات عاليه للبيوت. ومن اهم هذه المنشات المساجد والماذن والمدارس، واذا استثنيت قبه الصخره والمسجد القبلي، فان اكثر المساجد والماذن في القدس تعود الى العصر المملوكي، مثل المئذنه الفخريه عام 1278، ومئذنه باب الغوانمه من عام 1329، ومئذنه باب الاسباط عام 1367. ومن المساجد هناك مسجد القلعه الذي بُني عام 1310، والمسجد القيمري عام 1276 وجامع الخانقاه الصلاحيه، وتعود مئذنته الى عام 1395. ومن المساجد التي بنيت في العهد العثماني مسجد النبي داود الذي انشاه السلطان سليمان القانوني وهو مجمع معماري، ولقد حوّلته اسرائيل الى كنيس وازيلت الكتابات القرانيه منه واستبدلت بكتابه عبريه، وجامع المولويه المُشيّد سنه 1587 والمسجد القيمري.\nان اكثر المباني الاسلاميه في القدس هي المدارس التعليميه. حيث ان عدد المدارس والزوايا في القدس خلال القرن الحادي عشر الهجري كان 630 مدرسه، ومن اقدم المدارس المدرسه المنصوريه التي انشاها الملك المنصور قلاوون. وتمتاز عماره المدارس بالفناء ذي البركه تشرف عليه الاواوين والغرف، اما الواجهه الجميله التي تدخل منها الى المدرسه من خلال دركاه، فهي من مميزات العماره المملوكيه، واذا كانت المدارس المملوكيه في القدس لم ترق الى مستوى المدارس في القاهره التي تميزت بالاتساع والفخامه كمدرسه السلطان حسن، فانها مع ذلك تتمتع بالاناقه والبساطه والوحده، ومن اهم المدارس المملوكيه الباقيه حتى اليوم: المدرسه السلاميه (1300م)، المدرسه الجاوليه (1320م)، المدرسه التنكزيه (1329م)، المدرسه الامينيه (1330م)، المدرسه الملكيه (1340م)، المدرسه الفارسيه (1353م)، المدرسه الارغونيه (1356م)، المدرسه القشتمريه (1358م)، المدرسه المحدثيه (1360م)، والمدرسه الطشتمريه (1384م). تشمل معالم القدس الحاليّه ما يلي:\n\nالثقافه\nتُعتبر القدس مدينهً تنصهر فيها دينيًا الثقافه في بوتقه واحده، نظرًا لاهميتها الدينيه ولعب الدين دورًا مهمًا في حياه سكانها من العرب والاسرائيليين، كما ان ثقافه سكان منطقه القدس شكلت جزءًا كبيرًا من هويتهم منذ زمن بعيد، والتي كانت في الاغلب ثقافه تعبر عن الحضر الفلسطيني، وهذا يظهر بشكل واضح في اللكنه او اللهجه التي تميز سكان هذه المنطقه عن معظم اللهجات الفلسطينيه بقلب القاف الى الف، كذلك هو الحال بالنسبه للزي التقليدي الذي تميّز في منطقه القدس ووسط الضفه الغربيه عن غيره من الازياء الفلسطينيه الاخرى، حيث ان لمدينه القدس ثوبها الخاص، الذي يمتاز بانه اكثر الاثواب الفلسطينيه جمعًا لاثار كل العصور التي مرت على المدينه، فعلى الصدر توجد قبه ملكات الكنعانيون وعلى الجوانب تظهر طريقه التصليب منذ ايام الحكم الصليبي، كما ويظهر الهلال والايات القرانيه كدليل على عوده القدس للحكم الاسلامي العربي. وبشكل عام فان اثار النكبه تظهر علي الثوب الفلسطيني، اذ يظهر الحزن والحنين من خلال الالوان، من خلال اختفاء الالوان الزاهيه مشيره الى ان ظهور تطريز الماكينه دليل على عدم اهتمام المراه بالتطريز وعلى الوضع الاقتصادي السيئ.\nيُعتبر المتحف الاسرائيلي احد اهم المواقع الثقافيه بالمدينه، حيث يستقبل نحو مليون زائر سنويًا، يُشكل السيّاح ثلثهم. تصل مساحه مجمّع المتحف الى 20 دونم (81,000 م2) وهو يضم عدد من المباني ذات المعارض المختلفه، حيث تُعرض اعمال فنيّه اسرائيليه واوروبيه، اضافه للعديد من المكتشفات الاثريه والمخطوطات اليهوديه القديمه. وفي المتحف معلمٌ بارز هو صحن مائي يُعرف بصحن الكتاب، وهو يحوي مخطوطات البحر الميت التي اكتُشفت في اواسط القرن العشرين في كهوف خربه قمران بالقرب من البحر سالف الذكر. خُصصت احدى اجنحه المتحف لتلقين الاطفال دروس في الرسم النحت، ويزور هذا الجناح قرابه 100,000 طفل في السنه، ولهذا المتحف حديقه خارجيه مخصصه لعرض اعمال النحت، ومن ابرز المنحوتات فيها المنحوته المصغره لمعبد حيرود. ومن المتاحف الاخرى ذات الاهميه، متحف روكفلر في القدس الشرقيه او «متحف فلسطين للاثار» سابقا، الذي بُني ايام الانتداب البريطاني في سنه 1938، وهو يُعد اوّل متحف للاثار شُيّد في الشرق الاوسط. والذي تتخذه اليوم سلطه الاثار الاسرائيليه مقرا لها.\n\nتاوي القدس النصب التذكاري المعروف باسم نصب «ياد ڤاشيم» (بالعبريه: יד ושם)، المخصص لاحياء ذكرى اليهود الذين قضوا في المحرقه النازيه، وهذا النصب مجمّع ذو اجنحه عديده تُشكل اكبر ارشيف عالميّ لكل ما يتعلق بالمحرقه سالفه الذكر. من ابرز اجنحه المجمّع متحفًا فريدًا يعرض مواضيعًا مختلفه تتعلق بالاباده الجماعيه لليهود ويُركز على الروايات والقصص المتعلقه ببعض الافراد والعائلات الذين قُتلوا انذاك، كما يعرض مجموعه فنيّه من اعمال بعض الفنانين الذين قضوا نحبهم في المحرقه. يُحيي هذا النصب ايضًا ذكرى الاطفال اليهود الذين قتلهم النازيون بالاضافه الى «الشرفاء من بين الامم»، ويُقصد بهم الاشخاص غير اليهود الذين خاطروا بحياتهم خلال الحرب العالميه الثانيه لانقاذ اطفال اليهود من الاعدام. كذلك هناك جناحٌ يُطلق عليه تسميه «الجناح الموصول»، وهو يعرض اعمال فنيّه تمثل العيش المشترك بين الاسرائيليين والفلسطينيين، وهو يقع على الطريق الفاصله بين القدس الشرقيه والغربيه.\n\nتتخذ عدّه مراق وفرق فنيّه من القدس مقرًا لها، ومن هذه الاوركسترا السمفونيه المقدسيّه التي تاسست في عقد الاربعينات من القرن العشرين، بالاضافه الى الاوركسترا الاسرائيليه التي تؤدي اعمالها الفنيه في مركز المؤتمرات الدوليه (بالعبريه: מרכז הקונגרסים הבינלאומי) الذي يقع بالقرب من مدخل القدس الغربيّه، وايضًا المركز الموسيقي في القدس، الواقع حي «يمين موشيه»، وغيرها. استضافت القدس «المهرجان الاسرائيلي» طيله 25 عامًا، وهذا المهرجان يُقام سنويًا منذ سنه 1961 وتؤدى فيه عدّه اعمال مسرحيه خارجيه وداخليه بالاضافه لحفلات موسيقيه لمغنين محليين وعالميين. يستضيف مسرح القدس في حاره الطالبيه ما يزيد عن 150 حفلاً موسيقيًا في السنه، الى جانب عروض مسرحيه وراقصه لفنانين عالميين. وهناك ايضًا «مسرح خان» الذي يقع في الكاروانسرا مقابل محطه القطارات القديمه، وهو مسرح الذخائر الوحيد بالمدينه. ومن البرامج الثقافيه الخاصه بالقدس، مهرجان القدس السينمائي، الذي تُعرض فيه اعمال سينمائيه اسرائيليه وعالميه.\n\nتؤوي القدس بعض معارض اللوحات مثل «بيت تيخو»، في وسط المدينه، وهو منزل قديم تحوّل الى متحف حاليًا، تُعرض فيه لوحات الفنانه «حنّه تيخو» المعروفه برسمها لتلال القدس، والمجموعات العبرانيه لزوجها الذي كان يعمل كحالاً، وافتتح اول عياده لطب العيون في القدس سنه 1912. كذلك هناك معرض الحوش، وهو معرض فني فلسطيني تاسس في سنه 2004 تُعرض فيه عدّه اعمال فنيّه لفنانين فلسطينيين.\n\nاعلنت القدس عاصمهً للثقافه العربيه في سنه 2009. تُشكل المدينه مقرًا للمسرح الوطني الفلسطيني، الذي يعمل على الحفاظ على الثقافه والهويّه العربيه والفلسطينيه للقدس، بالاضافه لاجراء عدّه نشاطات تهدف الى احياء اهتمام الفلسطينيين بالفن. يرعى معهد ادوارد سعيد الوطني للموسيقى الاوركسترا الشبابيه الفلسطينيه، التي قامت بجوله فنيّه شملت دول الخليج العربي وغيرها من دول الشرق الاوسط في سنه 2009. يقع المتحف الاسلامي في القدس على متن الحرم القدسي الشريف، وقد تاسس هذا المتحف في سنه 1923، وهو يضم كثيرًا من القطع الاثريه الاسلاميه، التي تتراوح من ادوات الكحل صغيره الحجم والمخطوطات النادره، الى العواميد الرخاميه الضخمه. حظرت اسرائيل احتفالات اعلان القدس عاصمهً للثقافه العربيه بحجه انها كانت برعايه السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه، واقيم احتفال في بلده بيت عنان عوضًا عن ذلك، وعلى مدى 4 ايام، وحضره ما يزيد عن 15,000 شخص.\nهناك عدد من المؤسسات والمنظمات اللاربحيّه في القدس، التي تسعى للتقريب بين السكان من العرب والاسرائيليين، ومن شاكله هذه المنظمات: «الصندوق الابراهيمي» و«مركز التبادل الثقافي المقدسي»، الذان يُشجعان على القيام بمشاريع ثقافيه مشتركه بين الاسرائيليين والفلسطينيين، كذلك «مركز القدس للموسيقى والرقص الشرقي» الذي يُخصص حلقات عمل للاسرائيليين والعرب على حد سواء، ويهدف الى تعزيز لغه الحوار والتواصل بين الطرفين عن طريق تشجيعهم على القيام باعمال فنيّه مشتركه، ايضًا هناك الاوركسترا اليهوديه العربيه الشبابيّه، التي تؤدي عروض موسيقيه تقليديه اوروبيه وشرق اوسطيّه. قام الفنان البولندي «تشيسلاو دزاڤيگاي» بصنع منحوته تمثّل التعايش السلمي الذي يُطمح اليه بين الفلسطينيين والاسرائيليين، واطلق عليه «نصب التسامح» ونُصب في سنه 2008 على تله فاصله بين مستوطنه تلبيوت الشرقيه وجبل المكبر، كعلامه على نضال المقدسيين في سبيل الحصول على السلام.\n\nالاقتصاد\nكان الحج الى القدس يُشكل ابرز مواردها الماليه عبر التاريخ، بما انها مدينه داخليه تقع بعيدًا عن المرافئ الهامّه مثل يافا وغزه. لا تزال المعالم الدينيه في القدس هي ما يستقطب الزوّار الاجانب بشكل رئيسي، حيث ان معظمهم ياتي ليزور حائط البراق وكنيسه القيامه والمسجد الاقصى، وغيرها من الاماكن في البلده القديمه، الا انه اصبح من الجليّ خلال نصف القرن الفائت ان المدينه لا يمكنها ان تعتمد على هذه الزيارات وحدها لتؤمن مدخولاً كافيًا يفي بجميع الحاجات الحياتيه للسكان.\nتُظهر عدّه احصائيات ان اقتصاد المدينه في نمو مطّرد، الا انه من الملاحظ بان القدس الشرقيه لا تزال اقل نموًا من الغربيه، لكن على الرغم من ذلك فان نسبه الاسر العربيه التي يعمل عدد من افرادها اعلى من تلك الخاصه بالاسر اليهوديه، حيث تصل الاولى الى 76.1% والثانيه الى 66.8%. يصل معدّل البطاله في القدس الى 8.3%، وهو بهذا اقل من المعدّل الوطني الاسرائيلي الذي يصل الى 9.0%، على الرغم من ان نسبه القوّه العامله بالمدينه اقل من تلك الخاصه بمدن اخرى مثل تل ابيب (58.0%) وحيفا (52.4%). اظهرت دراسات اخرى ان نسبه الفقر بالقدس ارتفعت بشكل ملحوظ خلال الفتره الممتده من سنه 2001 حتى سنه 2007، حيث ازدادت نسبه السكان الذين يعيشون تحت خط الفقر بحوالي 40%. وصل معدّل المدخول الشهري للعامل في القدس خلال سنه 2006 الى 5,940 شيكل جديد (1,410 دولار امريكي)، اي اقل بحوالي 1,350 شيكل من العامل في تل ابيب.\n\nاصدرت السلطات البريطانيه قانونًا ايام الانتداب ينص على عدم جواز تشييد المباني الا باستخدام الحجر المقدسي، وذلك في سبيل الحفاظ على الهويّه التاريخيه وجماليّه هذه المدينه الفريده، وما زال هذا القانون ساري المفعول حتى الوقت الحالي، وهناك جهود لتكملته عن طريق عدم التشجيع على بناء المصانع داخل القدس؛ وقد خصصت السلطات الاسرائيليه 2.2% فقط من مساحه المدينه لتشييد المصانع، وبالمقابل يُلاحظ ان نسبه الاراضي المخصصه للبنى التحتيه في تل ابيب تفوق تلك الخاصه بالقدس بحوالي الضعف، بينما تفوق نسبه تلك الاراضي في حيفا نسبه اراضي القدس بحوالي سبعه مرّات. يعمل ما نسبته 8.5% من اجمالي القوه العامله الخاصه بمحافظه القدس في قطاع الصناعه، وهذا يُشكل نصف المعدل الوطني في اسرائيل (15.8%)، بالمقابل تفوق نسبه المقدسيين العاملين في قطاعات اخرى باقي المعدلات الوطنيه. قامت بضعه شركات التقنيه العاليه بفتح فروع لها او نقل مراكزها حتى من تل ابيب الى القدس، وقد ادّى مثل هذا الامر الى توفير 12,000 فرصه عمل جديده في سنه 2006. من المراكز الاقتصاديه المهمه في القدس ما يُعرف باسم «مجمّع الصناعات العلميه الغنيّه»، وهو مجمّع يقع في شمال المدينه ويُشكل مقرًا لبعض اهم الشركات مثل: انتل، شركه تيڤا لصناعه الادويه، اتوترونكس عوفير، وشركه ECI للاتصالات. يُخطط بعض المسؤولين لتوسعه هذا المجمّع حتى يُغطي مساحه 530,000 متر مربّع (130 فدّان)، ويتسع لمزيد من الشركات بالاضافه لمحطه اطفاء ومدرسه.\nلعبت الحكومه الاسرائيليه دورًا كبيرًا في تنميه اقتصاد القدس منذ تاسيس «دوله» اسرائيل، فهناك عدد كبير من الوظائف الحكوميه الشاغره بالمدينه، كونها مقر للحكومه، والاخيره تقدم دعمًا وحوافز متعدده للشركات والمؤسسات الوليده، كي تستمر متمركزه بالقدس. افادت مجله «السياحه والترفيه» (بالانجليزيه: Travel + Leisure) الامريكيه ان القدس هي افضل مدن افريقيا والشرق الاوسط للسياحه الترفيهيه في سنه 2010.\nيقول الخبراء ان اقتصاد القدس الشرقيه لا يزال يُعاني من مشاكل وعوائق مختلفه لاسباب عديده، منها جدار الفصل العازل الذي شيدته اسرائيل في عمق الضفه الغربيه وفي محيط مدينه القدس، الامر الذي يؤدي الى اخراج مدينه القدس من ارتباطها ببقيه الاراضي الفلسطينيه في الضفه الغربيه، والذي يجعلها مفتوحه فقط نحو اسرائيل، بالاضافه لاقامه الحواجز العسكريه واعاقه دخول سكان القرى المجاوره للقدس، وباقي سكان المدن الفلسطينيه مع ارتفاع تكلفه نقل البضائع نتيجه الحواجز والاغلاق. وحسب تقديرات الغرفه التجاريه في اخر دراسه اعدتها في شهر يوليو من سنه 2006 فانّ مدينه القدس كانت بحاجه الى استثمارات فوريه تقارب المئه وخمسون مليون دولار كنقطه بدايه كاستثمارات فوريه خلال الاعوام الثلاثه القادمه، وتشمل هذه الاستثمارات مجالات الاسكان السياحه وترميم البلده القديمه، وتطوير الصناعات الحرفيه في المدينه.\n\nومن الصعوبات التي تواجه هذا الشطر من المدينه وتعيق نموّه بشكل مطّرد التشدد في فرض الضرائب وجبايتها وتطبيق باقي القوانين الاقتصاديه والاجتماعيه على العرب الفلسطينيين في القدس. كذلك يقول الخبراء الفلسطينيون ان هنالك تشدّد في منع دخول المنتجات الفلسطينيه الى اسواق القدس، خصوصاً المنتجات الغذائيه كالالبان البيض وهي منتجات اقلّ سعراً من المنتجات الاسرائيليه المماثله.\nوقد ادّت القيود والاجراءات الاسرائيليه الى تراجع الاداء الاقتصادي للقدس الشرقيه في مختلف القطاعات، فقد اضطر عدد من المصانع الى تقليص انتاجها او اغلاق مصانعها بسبب انخفاض الطلب على المنتجات المحليه غير الغذائيه منها الى الثلث وضعف امكانيه المنتج المحلي على المنافسه نتيجه لارتفاع تكاليف التوزيع بسبب الاغلاق، كذلك ظهر انه في شهر اكتوبر من سنه 2000 انقطع التدفّق السياحي الى الشطر الشرقي، والغيت جميع الحجوزات حتى نهايه سنه 2001، فكان من نتيجه ذلك ان اغلقت بضعه فنادق ابوابها وسرّحت موظفيها.\n\nيقول مدير الغرفه التجاريه في القدس الشرقيه، عزّام ابو السعود، انّ موضوع الاستثمار، وبوجه الخصوص الاستثمار طويل المدى، او الذي يستغرق اقامه منشاته عده سنوات، والبحث عن مستثمرين، هو العنصر الذي يجب التركيز عليه في سبيل النهوض باقتصاد القدس الشرقيه، ودعا الى انشاء صندوق ضمان الاستثمار، الذي يضمن للمستثمر الخائف عائدًا مناسبًا لامواله، وضمانات ان لا يؤثّر الوضع الامني السياسي على مشروعه، وضمان عائد مجدي لاستثماره، كذلك دعا الى عدم اغفال موضوع التدريب واقتباس النموذج الالماني في التدريب الحرفي، كونه النموذج الذي قاد الالمان لاعاده بناء اقتصادهم الذي دمرته الحرب العالميه الثانيه. وقال انه يجب ان يتم احياء مشروع سوق القطّانين بالبلده القديمه، وكذلك الحمامات المملوكيه او التركيه بعد ترميمها. هذا بالاضافه الى تحويل جزء من الاستثمار الى قطاع الاسكان والانشاءات لتوفير المنازل الكافيه لبقاء اكبر عدد من سكان القدس. والاهتمام الاكبر بترميم منازل البلده القديمه، وانْ يشمل المنازل القديمه خارج السور وذلك لتوفير نوعيه حياه افضل للسكان. وفي سنه 2010، اعلن المهندس مازن سنقرط رئيس مجموعه سنقرط الاستثماريه عن تاسيس شركه قابضه في القدس تحمل اسم«القدس القابضه» براسمال 20 مليون دولار بهدف الاستثمار في عدد من القطاعات الاقتصاديه والتعليميه في القدس الشرقيه.\n\nالمواصلات\nيُعتبر مطار القدس الدولي اقرب المطارات الى القدس، وقد كان يُستخدم للطيران المدني حتى اغلقته السلطات الاسرائيليه في سنه 2001، وسيطر عليه الجيش الاسرائيلي لقمع الانتفاضه التي قامت في وجه اسرائيل في الضفه الغربيه وقطاع غزه. تحوّلت جميع الرحلات الجويّه بعد اغلاق المطار الى مطار بن غوريون الدولي، وهو اكبر مطارات اسرائيل واكثرها ازدحامًا، حيث يصل عدد المسافرين فيه سنويًا الى 9 ملايين مسافر.\nتتولى شركه «ايگد» التعاونيه، وهي ثاني اكبر شركه نقل بالحفلات في العالم، تقديم خدمه النقل للسكّان من والى القدس، وبداخلها، وهي تتمركز في محطه حافلات المدينه الواقعه في شارع يافا بالقرب من مدخل الطريق السريع الغربي للقدس. كانت الحافلات وسيارات الاجره والسيارات الخصوصيه هي وسائل النقل الاكثر استعمالاً في القدس حتى سنه 2008، عندما اُطلق مشروع سكه الحديد الخفيفه، وابتُدئ العمل فيه على قدم وساق. يقول المهندسون العاملون على المشروع، ان هذه القاطرات ستقدم خدمه النقل لحوالي 200,000 شخص يوميًا، وسيكون لها 24 محطه. انتهى العمل على هذه السكّه في 15 يونيو سنه 2010، وتمت تجربه القاطره الاولى في 23 اغسطس من نفس العام.\n\nمن المشاريع الاخرى التي تنوي اسرائيل تنفيذها بالقدس، مشروع سكه حديديه سريعه تمتد من تل ابيب الى القدس، يُخطط الانتهاء من العمل عليها في سنه 2011، وستكون محطتها الاخيره محطهً تحتارضيّه على عمق 80 مترًا (262.47 قدمًا)، تقع بالقرب من مركز المؤتمرات الدوليه ومحطه الحافلات، ويهدف المسؤولون الى وصل هذه السكه في نهايه المطاف بمحطه المالحه، وهي محطه القطارات المملوكه من قبل الدوله، والتي تقدم خدمه النقل من القدس الى تل ابيب مرورًا بمدينه بيت شيمش.\nتُعتبر طريق مناحيم بيگن السريعه احدى ابرز طرق القدس التي تصل شمالها بجنوبها؛ فهي تمتد على طول القسم الغربي من القدس وتتصل بطريق «معاليه بيت حورون» في الشمال لتكمل اتجاهها نحو تل ابيب. يمتد الطريق السريع رقم 60 عبر وسط المدينه بالقرب من الخط الاخضر الفاصل بين القدس الشرقيه والغربيه. يجري العمل حاليًا على تشييد طريق تحيط بالمدينه يبلغ طولها 35 كيلومترًا (22 ميلاً) لتصل الضواحي ببعضها البعض، لكن ردود الفعل حول هذا المشروع جاءت متناقضه حيث عارضه البعض وقبله البعض الاخر.\n\nالتعليم\nتتخذ عدّه جامعات مرموقه من القدس مقرًا لها، وتؤمّن برامج تعليميه للطلاّب باللغات العربيه، العبريه، والانگليزيه، ومن هذه الجامعات الجامعه العبريه التي تاسست في سنه 1925، وتُعتبر حاليًا من بين افضل 100 مؤسسه تعليميه في العالم. كان بعض ابرز العقول المفكره في العالم اعضاءً في مجلس امناء هذه الجامعه، ومنهم البرت اينشتاين وسيگموند فرويد، وقد تخرّج منها بعض الفائزين بجوائز نوبل مثل: اڤرام هيرشكو، داود گروس، ودانيال كاهنمان. تشتهر الجامعه العبريه بمكتبتها المعروفه بالمكتبه اليهوديه، التي يُحتفظ فيها باكثر من 5 ملايين كتاب. افتتحت هذه المكتبه في سنه 1892، اي قبل افتتاح الجامعه ذاتها بحوالي ثلاثه عقود، وهي اليوم المكتبه المركزيه للجامعه ومكتبه اسرائيل الوطنيه. للجامعه العبريه 3 احرام جامعيّه في القدس: على جبل المشارف، تله الشيخ بدر، وحرم طبيّ في مستشفى حداثه بعين كارم.\nتاسست جامعه القدس المفتوحه في سنه 1984 لتكون جامعه رائده لسكّان القدس العرب، وتصف الجامعه نفسها على انها «الجامعه العربيه الوحيده في القدس». تعاونت جامعه القدس المفتوحه وكليّه بارد من نيويورك على افتتاح كليّه مشتركه في ذات المبنى الذي كان يُشكل مقر المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني حيث كان يقع مكتب الرئيس الفلسطيني ياسر عرفات، وذلك في خريف سنه 2010، ومن المقرر انشاء برنامج دراسي لمنح درجه ماجستير تدريس الاداب. يقع الحرم الرئيسي لهذه الجامعه جنوب شرقي القدس في بلده ابو ديس، وتبلغ مساحته 190,000 متر مربّع (47 فدّان). ومن مؤسسات التعليم العالي الاخرى في المدينه: اكاديميه القدس لتعليم الموسيقى والرقص، واكاديميه بيتسالئيل للفنون والتصميم، وكلا المبنيين يقعان في حرم الجامعه العبريه.\n\nتاسست كليّه القدس للعلوم التقنيه في سنه 1969، وهي تؤمن برامج تدريب هندسيه وتقنيه للطلاّب، وهذه الكليّه هي احدى المدارس التي تجمع بين البرامج العلمانيه والدينيّه في القدس الغربيه، وفي الشطر الاخير من المدينه عدد من المدارس الدينيه اليهوديه مثل «مدرسه صموئيل» و«مدرسه مير يشيڤا»، التي يُزعم انها اكبرها. وصل عدد التلاميذ في السنه الدراسيه الاخيره في المدارس اليهوديه خلال العام الدراسي 2003–2004 الى 8,000 تلميذ، الا ان 55% من هؤلاء فقط يتقدمون لامتحان شهاده الثانويه العامه، اما الباقون فيلتحقون بالمعاهد المهنيه الحريديه. تُقدّم بلديّه القدس حوافزًا ماليه في سبيل استقطاب المزيد من التلاميذ اليهود الى الجامعات الاسرائيليه في القدس، بالاضافه الى اعانات لاولئك الذين يستاجرون شققًا سكنيه للاقامه فيها طيله مده دراستهم.\n\nتسعى المؤسسات الاسرائيليه المختلفه وبدعم من الحكومه من اجل تحقيق سيطره مطلقه على قطاع التعليم العربي في مدينه القدس، وذلك بعد ان تمّ التحكم بنحو 66% من قطاع التعليم العربي في مدينه القدس، حيث تم فرض المناهج التعليميه على المدارس الابتدائيه العربيه هناك منذ عام 1968، وتبعًا لذلك تم استبدال كلمه «فلسطين» بكلمه «اسرائيل» و«القدس» بكلمه «اورشليم القدس». ويقول الخبراء الفلسطينيون ان الحكومه الاسرائيليه تحاول التضييق على الطلبه العرب في مدينه القدس لاجبارهم على ترك المدينه للاستئثار بخيارات التعليم، الامر الذي يعرضهم للانتقال من مدينه القدس وفقًا لما تنص عليه القوانين الاسرائيليه. يُعاني معظم الطلاّب العرب في القدس من عوائق ومشاكل عديده من جراء السياسات الاسرائيليه، فثمه اكتظاظ شديد في الصفوف المدرسيه والدوام في غالبيه المدارس على فترتين، وهناك نقص حاد وكبير في المختبرات في المدارس العربيه في القدس، ناهيك عن ضعف التجهيزات الرياضيه وكذلك النقص الواضح للمعلمين والخدمات، والملاحظ ايضًا ان المدارس غير مؤهله للتدريس الجيد بسبب قدمها وعدم القيام بعمليه تحديث ضروريه. ونظرًا لهذه الاسباب وصلت نسبه تسرب الطلبه العرب في القدس قبل الوصول الى المرحله الثانويه الى نحو 50% خلال العقد الاول من القرن الحادي والعشرين، كما تشير احدى الدراسات، وقد ادّى هذا الى هجره لطلاّب واسر كامله الى مدن وقرى الضفه الغربيه للبحث عن فرص تعليم مجانيه. يلتحق البعض من المقدسيين العرب بالمدارس الاسرائيليه، لكن هؤلاء يتبعون في غالبيتهم ادارات وسياسات اما البلديه او وزاره المعارف الاسرائيليه، التي تهدف الى «تعميق المفاهيم الصهيونيه، وضرب الانتماء الفلسطيني، من خلال حصص تعليميه عن الهويه اليهوديه والتراث اليهودي الصهيوني، وربط الهبات والمكافات للمدارس بنسبه التجنيد للجيش او الخدمه المدنيه والعسكريه، الى جانب معايير اخرى».\nاطلقت ملكه الاردن رانيا العبد الله مبادره «مدرستي فلسطين» وذلك لدعم التعليم وتحسين البيئه التعليميه في مدارس القدس العربيه، «لا لان للاردن علاقه بالقدس ودورًا تاريخيًا فقط ولكن لان القدس مسؤوليه كل عربي اولاً واخيرًا» على حد تعبيرها. من ابرز المؤسسات التعليميه في القدس الشرقيه، المركز المعروف باسم «المركز التربوي لتطوير العاملين في حقل التعليم في القدس»، الذي يُعتبر المركز الوحيد التي يقدم الخدمات لمعلمي شرقي القدس. يرى المركز نفسه كمحور تربوي يُقدم الخدمات لجهاز التعليم بكل ما لديه من موارد وامكانات.\n\nالرياضه\nتعتبر كل من كره القدم وكره السله، اللعبتان الاكثر شعبيه في مدينه القدس، سواء عند العرب او اليهود. يعتبر نادي جبل المكبر (المؤسس في 1976) من اشهر الانديه المقدسيه والذي يلعب بالدوري الفلسطيني الممتاز بالضفه الغربيه، والذي هو عضو في الاتحاد الاسيوي لكره القدم، ويتخذ من ملعب فيصل الحسيني مركزًا له، والذي يقع في الرام شمال القدس. من جهه اخرى، يعتبر كل من نادي بيتار القدس ونادي هابويل القدس من اكثر الانديه شهره في اسرائيل، ويتخذان ايضًا من ملاعب القدس مركزًا لهما. من الانديه الفلسطينيه الاخرى في القدس: هلال القدس، العربي بيت صفافا، الانصار المقدسي، دي لاسال، اهلي القدس، جبل الزيتون، اسلامي سلوان، ابناء القدس، ارثوذكسي القدس، وغيرها.\nعرفت الرياضه النسويه الفلسطينيه نهوضًا ملحوظًا في القدس منذ ان تولى اللواء جبريل الرجوب رئاسه اتحاد الكره الفلسطينيه واللجنه الاولمبيه الفلسطينيه، وقد تاسس فريق كره القدم النسائيه الاول بالمدينه حوالي سنه 2008، وواجه وما زال مشكلات كبيره وهي النقص الحاد في الدعم المادي وحتى المعنوي، لكنه استطاع ان يصبح من الانديه المعروفه على الرغم من ذلك.\nيقام في القدس سنويًا، سباق جري سنوي نصفي، حيث يركض المتسابقون من كل انحاء العالم متنافسين في جوله حول اشهر معالم المدينه. بالاضافه الى هذا السباق النصفي ذو 21.1 كم، يمكن للمشاركين الركض مسافه 10 كم. كل من المسارين يبدا وينتهي عند تله الشيخ بدر او «گفعات رام».\n\nالاعلام\nخرج من القدس عددٌ من المشاهير، من عرب واسرائيليين، ومنهم:\n\nالعرب\nمحمد كامل البديري، مفوض مقاطعه رام الله خلال العهد العثماني ومؤسس جريده الصباح.\nمبارك عوّاد، عالم نفس فلسطيني

      "summary": "القُدْس هي أكبر مدن فِلسْطِين المحتلّة مساحةً وسكانًا وأكثرها أهمية دينيًا واقتصاديًا. تُعرف بأسماء أخرى في اللغة العربية مثل: بيت المقدس، القدس الشريف، أولى القبلتين، وفي الكتاب المقدس باسم أورشليم، وتسميها إسرائيل رسمياً: أورشليم القدس.\nيعتبرها العرب والفلسطينيون وقطاع عريض من داعمي القضية الفلسطينية، عاصمةَ دولة فلسطين المستقبلية بعد التحرير، كما ورد في وثيقة إعلان الاستقلال الفلسطينية التي صدرت في الجزائر بتاريخ 15 نوفمبر سنة 1988م، (أما تاريخياً كون أجدادهم اليبوسيين تاريخياً، أول من بنى المدينة وسكنها في الألف الخامس ق.م). فيما تعتبرها إسرائيل عاصمتها الموحدة، أثر ضمها الجزء الشرقي من المدينة عام 1980م، والذي احتلته بعد حرب سنة 1967 (يعتبرها اليهود عاصمتهم الدينية والوطنية لأكثر من 3000 سنة). أما الأمم المتحدة والمجتمع الدولي، فلا يعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، ويعتبر القدس الشرقية جزءاً من الأراضي الفلسطينية، ولا يعترف بضمها للدولة العبرية، مع بعض الاستثناءات. تقع القدس ضمن سلسلة جبال الخليل وتتوسط المنطقة الواقعة بين البحر المتوسط والطرف الشمالي للبحر الميت، وقد نمت هذه المدينة وتوسعت حدودها كثيرًا عما كانت عليه في العصور السابقة.\nتُعتبر القدس مدينة مقدسة عند أتباع الديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث الرئيسية: اليهودية، المسيحية، الإسلام. فبالنسبة لليهود، أصبحت المدينة أقدس المواقع بعد أن فتحها النبي والملك داود وجعل منها عاصمة مملكة إسرائيل الموحدة حوالي سنة 1000 ق.م، ثم أقدم ابنه سليمان، على بناء أول هيكل فيها، كما تنص التوراة. وعند المسيحيين، أصبحت المدينة موقعًا مقدسًا، بعد أن صُلب يسوع المسيح على إحدى تلالها المسماة «جلجثة» حوالي سنة 30 للميلاد، وبعد أن عثرت القديسة هيلانة على الصليب الذي عُلّق عليه بداخل المدينة بعد حوالي 300 سنة، وفقًا لما جاء في العهد الجديد. أما عند المسلمين، فالقدس هي ثالث أقدس المدن بعد مكة والمدينة المنورة، وهي أولى القبلتين، حيث كان المسلمون يتوجهون إليها في صلاتهم بعد أن فُرضت عليهم حوالي سنة 610 للميلاد، وهي أيضًا تمثل الموقع الذي عرج منه نبي الإسلام محمد بن عبد الله إلى السماء وفقًا للمعتقد الإسلامي. وكنتيجة لهذه الأهمية الدينية العظمى، تحوي المدينة القديمة عددًا من المعالم الدينية ذات الأهمية الكبرى، مثل: كنيسة القيامة، حائط البراق والمسجد الأقصى - المكون من عدة معالم مقدسة أهمها مسجد قبة الصخرة والمسجد القبلي، على الرغم من أن مساحتها تصل إلى 0.9 كيلومترات مربعة (0.35 أميال مربعة).\nخلال تاريخها الطويل، تعرضت القدس للتدمير مرتين، وحوصرت 23 مرة، وهوجمت 52 مرة، وتمّ غزوها وفقدانها مجددًا 44 مرة. استوطن البشر الموقع الذي شُيدت به المدينة منذ الألفية الرابعة ق.م، الأمر الذي يجعل من القدس إحدى أقدم المدن المأهولة في العالم. تُصنّف المدينة القديمة على أنها موقع تراث عالمي، وقد جرت العادة والعرف على تقسيمها إلى 4 حارات، إلا أن الأسماء المستخدمة اليوم لكل حارة من هذه الحارات: حارة الأرمن، حارة النصارى، حارة الشرف (أو حارة اليهود)، وحارة المسلمين، لم تظهر إلا في أوائل القرن التاسع عشر. رشحت الأردن المدينة القديمة لتُدرج ضمن قائمة مواقع التراث العالمي المهددة في سنة 1982.\nيُعتبر النزاع القائم حول وضع القدس مسألةً محورية في الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي. أقدمت الحكومة الإسرائيلية بعد حرب سنة 1967 بين الجيوش العربية والإسرائيلية على احتلال القدس الشرقية التي كانت تتبع الأردن، وألحقتها بإسرائيل واعتبرتها جزءاً لا يتجزأ منها، إلا أن المجتمع الدولي بأغلبيته، لم يعترف بهذا الضم، وما زال ينظر إلى القدس الشرقية على أنها منطقة متنازع عليها ويدعو بين الحين والآخر إلى حل هذه القضية عن طريق إجراء مفاوضات سلميّة بين إسرائيل والفلسطينيين. كذلك، فإن أغلبية الدول في العالم لا تعترف بالقدس عاصمة لإسرائيل، لذا فإن معظم السفارات والقنصليات الأجنبية تقع في مدينة تل أبيب وضواحيها. طالب الفلسطينيون -وما زالوا- بالقدس الشرقية عاصمةً لدولة فلسطينية، منذ أن احتلها الإسرائيليون، إلا أن البرلمان الإسرائيلي أقرّ في 31 يوليو سنة 1980 «قانون أساس: القدس عاصمة إسرائيل»، الذي جعل إعلان القدس، بالحدود التي رسمتها الحكومة الإسرائيلية عام 1967، مبدأً دستوريًا في القانون الإسرائيلي. رد مجلس الأمن بقرارين، رقم 476 ورقم 478 سنة 1980 وجه اللوم إلى إسرائيل بسبب إقرار هذا القانون وأكد أنه يخالف القانون الدولي، وليس من شأنه أن يمنع استمرار سريان اتفاقية جنيف الرابعة لسنة 1949 على الجزء الشرقي من القدس، كما ويفترض أن تكون المدينة ضمن محافظة القدس التابعة لدولة فلسطين. أدارت منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية مركزًا لها في بيت الشرق بالقدس إلا أنه أغلق في سنة 2001 بأمر من وزارة الداخلية الإسرائيلية.\nتقع معظم الإدارات الحكومية الإسرائيلية في القدس الغربية، وهي تشمل: البرلمان الإسرائيلي أو الكنيست، مقريّ رئيس الوزراء ورئيس الدولة، والمحكمة العليا. القدس أيضًا هي مقر الجامعة العبرية ومتحف إسرائيل ومزار الكتاب، وفيها أيضًا حديقة الحيوان الكتابية، التي تُصنّف على أنها جاذب هام في السياحة الداخلية، واستاد تيدي الذي يُعتبر أحد أهم وأكبر ملاعب كرة القدم في إسرائيل.",
