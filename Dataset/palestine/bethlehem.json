      "content": "Bethlehem is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, located about ten kilometres (six miles) south of Jerusalem, and the capital of the Bethlehem Governorate. It had a population of 28,591 people, as of 2017. The city's economy is strongly linked to tourism, especially during the Christmas period, when Christians embark on a pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, which is revered as the location of the birth of Jesus.\nA possible first mention of Bethlehem is in the Amarna correspondence of ancient Egypt, dated to 1350–1330 BCE, although that reading is uncertain. In the Hebrew Bible, the period of the Israelites is described; it identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of David. In the New Testament, the city is identified as the birthplace of Jesus of Nazareth. Under the Roman Empire, the city of Bethlehem was destroyed by Hadrian, but later rebuilt by Constantine the Great, who commissioned the Church of the Nativity in 327 CE. In 529, the Church of the Nativity was heavily damaged by Samaritans involved in the Samaritan revolts; following the victory of the Byzantine Empire, it was rebuilt by Justinian I.\nLater, during the rule of several Caliphates, Bethlehem became part of Jund Filastin in 637. Muslims continued to rule the city until 1099, when it was conquered by the Crusaders, who replaced the local Christian Greek Orthodox clergy with Catholic ones. In the mid-13th century, Bethlehem's walls were demolished by the Mamluk Sultanate. However, they were rebuilt by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century when it came to control the region. After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Bethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine until 1948, and later of the West Bank that was annexed by Jordan following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Bethlehem was occupied by Israel along with the rest of the West Bank. Since the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority, Bethlehem has been designated as part of Area A of the West Bank, nominally rendering it as being under Palestinian control, but it remains under Israeli occupation. Movement around the city is limited due to the Israeli West Bank barrier.\nHistorically, it was a city of Arab Christians, who made up about 86% of the population in 1950, but this community has dwindled significantly to 10% as of 2022, and now has a majority of Arab Muslims.\n\nEtymology\nThe current name for Bethlehem in local languages is  /Bēt laḥm/ in Arabic (Arabic: بيت لحم), literally meaning \"house of meat\", and Bet Leḥem in Hebrew (Hebrew: בֵּית לֶחֶם), literally \"house of bread\" or \"house of food.\" The city was called in Ancient Greek: Βηθλεέμ Ancient Greek pronunciation: [bɛːtʰle.ém] and in Latin: Bethleem. In Aramaic, the name of Bethlehem was simply the Hebrew name בית לחם, and was pronounced as Beit Lekhem. Evidence for this spelling can be inferred based on the fact that the spelling ܒܝܬܠܚܡ can be found in the Syriac Aramaic version of the bible in Matthew 2 as well as other parts of the book. The letters ܒܝܬܠܚܡ transliterate to ביתלחם. Amarna letter EA290 makes reference to a town bīt-ninurta which has been read as Bit-Lachmi by scholar W. F. Albright, following a proposal by Otto Schroeder in 1815 and making it a potential first historical reference to Bethlehem. This reading is, however, uncertain and has met with objections.\n\n\"House of the god Lahmu\"\nCanaanite and Israelite toponyms starting with beth are interpreted to mean \"house of\", with 'house' understood as 'temple' and the second part of the name indicating the deity the local temple was dedicated to. Accordingly, one longstanding suggestion in scholarship is that the name Bethlehem derives from the Mesopotamian or Canaanite fertility god Laḫmu and his consort sister Lahamu, lahmo being the Chaldean word for \"fertility\". Biblical scholar William F. Albright believed that this hypothesis, first put forth by Otto Schröder, was \"certainly accurate\". Albright noted that the pronunciation of the name had remained essentially the same for 3,500 years, even if the perceived meaning had shifted over time: \"'Temple of the God Lakhmu' in Canaanite, 'House of Bread' in Hebrew and Aramaic, 'House of Meat' in Arabic.\" While Schröder's theory is not widely accepted, it continues to find favour in academic literature over the later literal translations.\n\n\"House of war\"\nAnother suggestion is an association with the root l-h-m \"to fight\", leading to the meaning of \"house of war\" or \"house of fighting\", but this is thought unlikely.\n\nHistory\nCanaanite period\nThe earliest reference to Bethlehem appears in the Amarna correspondence (c. 1400 BCE). In one of his six letters to Pharaoh, Abdi-Heba, the Egyptian-appointed governor of Jerusalem, appeals for aid in retaking Bit-Laḫmi in the wake of disturbances by Apiru mercenaries: \"Now even a town near Jerusalem, Bit-Lahmi by name, a village which once belonged to the king, has fallen to the enemy... Let the king hear the words of your servant Abdi-Heba, and send archers to restore the imperial lands of the king!\"\nIt is thought that the similarity of this name to its modern forms indicates that it was originally a settlement of Canaanites who shared a Semitic cultural and linguistic heritage with the later arrivals. Laḫmu was the Akkadian god of fertility, worshipped by the Canaanites as Leḥem. Some time in the third millennium BCE, Canaanites erected a temple on the hill now known as the Hill of the Nativity, probably dedicated to Laḫmu. The temple, and subsequently the town that formed around it, was then known as Beit Lahama, \"House (Temple) of Lahmu\". By 1200 BC, the area of Bethlehem, as well as much of the region, was conquered by the Philistines, which led the region to be known to the Greeks as \"Philistia\", later corrupted to \"Palestine\".\nA burial ground discovered in spring 2013, and surveyed in 2015 by a joint Italian–Palestinian team found that the necropolis covered 3 hectares (more than 7 acres) and originally contained more than 100 tombs in use between roughly 2200 BCE and 650 BCE. The archaeologists were able to identify at least 30 tombs.\n\nIsraelite and Judean period\nArchaeological confirmation of Bethlehem as a city in the Kingdom of Judah was uncovered in 2012 at the archaeological dig at the City of David in the form of a bulla (seal impression in dried clay) in ancient Hebrew script that reads \"From the town of Bethlehem to the King\". According to the excavators, it was used to seal the string closing a shipment of grain, wine, or other goods sent as a tax payment in the 8th or 7th century BCE.\n\nBiblical scholars believe Bethlehem, located in the \"hill country\" of Judea, may be the same as the Biblical Ephrath, which means \"fertile\", as there is a reference to it in the Book of Micah as Bethlehem Ephrathah or Bethlehem Ephratah. The Hebrew Bible also calls it Beth-Lehem Judah, and the New Testament describes it as the \"City of David\". It is first mentioned in the Bible as the place where the matriarch Rachel died and was buried \"by the wayside\" (Genesis 48:7). Rachel's Tomb, the traditional grave site, stands at the entrance to Bethlehem. According to the Book of Ruth, the valley to the east is where Ruth of Moab gleaned the fields and returned to town with Naomi. In the Books of Samuel, Bethlehem is mentioned as the home of Jesse, father of King David of Israel, and the site of David's anointment by the prophet Samuel. It was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his warriors brought him water when he was hiding in the cave of Adullam.\nWriting in the 4th century, the Pilgrim of Bordeaux reported that the sepulchers of David, Ezekiel, Asaph, Job, Jesse, and Solomon were located near Bethlehem.\n\nClassical period\nThe Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke represent Jesus as having been born in Bethlehem, known in Aramaic by the Hebrew name בית לחם (Beit Lekhem). However, modern scholars regard the two accounts as contradictory; the Gospel of Mark, the earliest gospel, mentions nothing about Jesus having been born in Bethlehem, saying only that he came from Nazareth. Current scholars are divided on the actual birthplace of Jesus: some believe he was actually born in Nazareth, while others still hold that he was born in Bethlehem.\nNonetheless, the tradition that Jesus was born in Bethlehem was prominent in the early church. Around 155, the apologist Justin Martyr recommended that those who doubted Jesus was really born in Bethlehem could go there and visit the very cave where he was supposed to have been born. The same cave is also referenced by the apocryphal Gospel of James and the fourth-century church historian Eusebius. After the Bar Kokhba revolt (c. 132–136 CE) was crushed, the Roman emperor Hadrian converted the Christian site above the Grotto into a shrine dedicated to the Greek god Adonis, to honour his favourite, the Greek youth Antinous.\nAround 395 CE, Jerome wrote in a letter: \"Bethlehem... belonging now to us... was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz, that is to say, Adonis, and in the cave where once the infant Christ cried, the lover of Venus was lamented.\" Many scholars have taken this letter as evidence that the cave of the nativity over which the Church of the Nativity was later built had at one point been a shrine to the ancient Near Eastern fertility god Tammuz. Eusebius, however, mentions nothing about the cave having been associated with Tammuz and there are no other Patristic sources that suggest Tammuz had a shrine in Bethlehem. Peter Welten has argued that the cave was never dedicated to Tammuz and that Jerome misinterpreted Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual over Tammuz's death. Joan E. Taylor has countered this contention by arguing that Jerome, as an educated man, could not have been so naïve as to mistake Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual for Tammuz.\nIn 326–328, the empress Helena, widowed consort of Emperor Constantius Chlorus and mother of the ruling emperor, Constantine the Great, made a pilgrimage to Syria-Palaestina, in the course of which she visited the ruins of Bethlehem. The Church of the Nativity was built at her initiative over the cave where Jesus was purported to have been born. During the Samaritan revolt of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the Church of the Nativity destroyed; they were rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor Justinian I. In 614, the Persian Sassanid Empire, supported by Jewish rebels, invaded Palestina Prima and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the magi depicted in Persian clothing in a mosaic.\n\nMiddle Ages\nIn 637, shortly after Jerusalem was captured by the Muslim armies, 'Umar ibn al-Khattāb, the second caliph, promised that the Church of the Nativity would be preserved for Christian use. A mosque dedicated to Umar was built upon the place in the city where he prayed, next to the church. Bethlehem then passed through the control of the Islamic caliphates of the Umayyads in the 8th century, then the Abbasids in the 9th century. A Persian geographer recorded in the mid-9th century that a well preserved and much venerated church existed in the town. In 985, the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi visited Bethlehem, and referred to its church as the \"Basilica of Constantine, the equal of which does not exist anywhere in the country-round.\" In 1009, during the reign of the sixth Fatimid Caliph, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the Church of the Nativity was ordered to be demolished, but was spared by local Muslims, because they had been permitted to worship in the structure's southern transept.\nIn 1099, Bethlehem was captured by the Crusaders, who fortified it and built a new monastery and cloister on the north side of the Church of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox clergy were removed from their sees and replaced with Latin clerics. Up until that point the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100, Baldwin I, first king of the Frankish Kingdom of Jerusalem, was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.\nIn 1187, Saladin, the Sultan of Egypt and Syria who led the Muslim Ayyubids, captured Bethlehem from the Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered from the loss of the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims. William IV, Count of Nevers had promised the Christian bishops of Bethlehem that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them in the small town of Clamecy in present-day Burgundy, France. As a result, the Bishop of Bethlehem duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy, in 1223. Clamecy remained the continuous 'in partibus infidelium' seat of the Bishopric of Bethlehem for almost 600 years, until the French Revolution in 1789.\nBethlehem, along with Jerusalem, Nazareth, and Sidon, was briefly ceded to the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem by a treaty between Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and Ayyubid Sultan al-Kamil in 1229, in return for a ten-year truce between the Ayyubids and the Crusaders. The treaty expired in 1239, and Bethlehem was recaptured by the Muslims in 1244. In 1250, with the coming to power of the Mamluks under Rukn al-Din Baibars, tolerance of Christianity declined. Members of the clergy left the city, and in 1263 the town walls were demolished. The Latin clergy returned to Bethlehem the following century, establishing themselves in the monastery adjoining the Basilica of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox were given control of the basilica and shared control of the Milk Grotto with the Latins and the Armenians.\n\nOttoman era\nFrom 1517, during the years of Ottoman control, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches. By the end of the 16th century, Bethlehem had become one of the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was subdivided into seven quarters. The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among other leaders during this period. The Ottoman tax record and census from 1596 indicates that Bethlehem had a population of 1,435, making it the 13th largest village in Palestine at the time. Its total revenue amounted to 30,000 akce.\nBethlehem paid taxes on wheat, barley and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were organized into separate communities, each having its own leader. Five leaders represented the village in the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population was slightly more prosperous or grew more grain than grapes (the former being a more valuable commodity).\n\nFrom 1831 to 1841, Palestine was under the rule of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty of Egypt. During this period, the town suffered an earthquake as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops, apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of Ibrahim Pasha, during the Peasants' revolt in Palestine. In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once again and remained so until the end of World War I. Under the Ottomans, Bethlehem's inhabitants faced unemployment, compulsory military service, and heavy taxes, resulting in mass emigration, particularly to South America. An American missionary in the 1850s reported a population of under 4,000, nearly all of whom belonged to the Greek Church. He also noted that a lack of water limited the town's growth.\nSocin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870 that Bethlehem had a population of 179 Muslims in 59 houses, 979 \"Latins\" in 256 houses, 824 \"Greeks\" in 213 houses, and 41 Armenians in 11 houses, a total of 539 houses. The population count only included men. Hartmann found that Bethlehem had 520 houses.\n\nModern era\nBethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine from 1920 to 1948. In the United Nations General Assembly's 1947 resolution to partition Palestine, Bethlehem was included in the international enclave of Jerusalem to be administered by the United Nations. Jordan captured the city during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Many refugees from areas captured by Israeli forces in 1947–48 fled to the Bethlehem area, primarily settling in what became the official refugee camps of 'Azza (Beit Jibrin) and 'Aida in the north and Dheisheh in the south. The influx of refugees significantly transformed Bethlehem's Christian majority into a Muslim one.\nJordan retained control of the city until the Six-Day War in 1967, when Bethlehem was captured by Israel, along with the rest of the West Bank. Following the Six-Day War, Israel took control of the city.\n\nDuring the early months of First Intifada, on 5 May 1989, Milad Anton Shahin, aged 12, was shot dead by Israeli soldiers. Replying to a Member of Knesset in August 1990 Defence Minister Yitzak Rabin stated that a group of reservists in an observation post had come under attack by stone throwers. The commander of the post, a senior non-commissioned officer, fired two plastic bullets in deviation of operational rules. No evidence was found that this caused the boy's death. The officer was found guilty of illegal use of a weapon and sentenced to 5 months imprisonment, two of them actually in prison doing public service. He was also demoted.\nOn December 21, 1995, Israeli troops withdrew from Bethlehem, and three days later the city came under the administration and military control of the Palestinian National Authority in accordance with the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. During the Second Palestinian Intifada in 2000–2005, Bethlehem's infrastructure and tourism industry were damaged. In 2002, it was a primary combat zone in Operation Defensive Shield, a major military counteroffensive by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF besieged the Church of the Nativity, where dozens of Palestinian militants had sought refuge. The siege lasted 39 days. Several militants were killed. It ended with an agreement to exile 13 of the militants to foreign countries.\n\nToday, the city is surrounded by two bypass roads for Israeli settlers, leaving the inhabitants squeezed between thirty-seven Jewish enclaves, where a quarter of all West Bank settlers, roughly 170,000, live; the gap between the two roads is closed by the 8-metre high Israeli West Bank barrier, which cuts Bethlehem off from its sister city Jerusalem. Christian families that have lived in Bethlehem for hundreds of years are being forced to leave as land in Bethlehem is seized, and homes bulldozed, for construction of thousands of new Israeli homes. Land seizures for Israeli settlements have also prevented construction of a new hospital for the inhabitants of Bethlehem, as well as the barrier separating dozens of Palestinian families from their farmland and Christian communities from their places of worship. Christians have reportedly suffered persecution under the Palestinian Authority, leading to emigration.\n\nGeography\nBethlehem is located at an elevation of about 775 meters (2,543 ft) above sea level, 30 meters (98 ft) higher than nearby Jerusalem. Bethlehem is situated on the Judean Mountains.\nThe city is located 73 kilometers (45 mi) northeast of Gaza City and the Mediterranean Sea, 75 kilometers (47 mi) west of Amman, Jordan, 59 kilometers (37 mi) southeast of Tel Aviv, Israel and 10 kilometers (6 mi) south of Jerusalem. Nearby cities and towns include Beit Safafa and Jerusalem to the north, Beit Jala to the northwest, Husan to the west, al-Khadr and Artas to the southwest, and Beit Sahour to the east. Beit Jala and the latter form an agglomeration with Bethlehem. The Aida and Azza refugee camps are located within the city limits.\nIn the center of Bethlehem is its old city. The old city consists of eight quarters, laid out in a mosaic style, forming the area around the Manger Square. The quarters include the Christian an-Najajreh, al-Farahiyeh, al-Anatreh, al-Tarajmeh, al-Qawawsa and Hreizat quarters and al-Fawaghreh—the only Muslim quarter. Most of the Christian quarters are named after the Arab Ghassanid clans that settled there. Al-Qawawsa Quarter was formed by Arab Christian emigrants from the nearby town of Tuqu' in the 18th century. There is also a Syriac quarter outside of the old city, whose inhabitants originate from Midyat and Ma'asarte in Turkey. The total population of the old city is about 5,000.\n\nClimate\nBethlehem has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa), with hot and dry summers and mild, wetter winters. Winter temperatures (mid-December to mid-March) can be cool and rainy. January is the coldest month, with temperatures ranging from 1 to 13 degree Celsius (33–55 °F). From May through September, the weather is warm and sunny. August is the hottest month, with a high of 30 degrees Celsius (86 °F). Bethlehem receives an average of 700 millimeters (28 in) of rainfall annually, 70% between November and January.\nBethlehem's average annual relative humidity is 60% and reaches its highest rates between January and February. Humidity levels are at their lowest in May. Night dew may occur in up to 180 days per year. The city is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea breeze that occurs around mid-day. However, Bethlehem is affected also by annual waves of hot, dry, sandy and dust Khamaseen winds from the Arabian Desert, during April, May and mid-June.\n\nDemographics\nPopulation\nAccording to Ottoman tax records, Christians made up roughly 60% of the population in the early 16th century, while the Christian and Muslim populations became equal by the middle of that century. However, there were no Muslim inhabitants counted by the end of the century, with a recorded population of 287 adult male taxpayers. Christians, like all non-Muslims throughout the Ottoman Empire, were required to pay the jizya tax. In 1867, an American visitor describes the town as having a population of 3,000 to 4,000, of whom about 100 were Protestant, 300 were Muslim and \"the remainder belonging to the Latin and Greek Churches with a few Armenians.\" Another report from the same year puts the Christian population at 3,000, with an additional 50 Muslims. An 1885 source put the population at approximately 6,000 of \"principally Christians, Latins and Greeks\" with no Jewish inhabitants.\nThe census of 1922 lists Bethlehem as having 6,658 residents (5,838 Christians, 818 Muslims, and two Jews), increasing in 1931 to 6,804 (5,588 Christians, 1,219 Muslims, five with no religion, and two Jews) with 506 in nearby suburbs (251 Muslims, 216 Christians, and 39 Jews).\nThe 1938 village statistics list the population as 7,520 with 499 in nearby suburbs (including 42 Jews). The 1945 village statistics list Bethlehem's population as 8,820 (6,430 Christians, 2,370 Muslims, and 20 \"other\").\nIn 1948, the religious makeup of the city was 85% Christian, mostly of the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic denominations, and 13% Muslim. In the 1967 census taken by Israel authorities, the town of Bethlehem proper numbered 14,439 inhabitants, its 7,790 Muslim inhabitants represented 53.9% of the population, while the Christians of various denominations numbered 6,231 or 46.1%.\nIn the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 21,670, including a total of 6,570 refugees, accounting for 30.3% of the city's population. In 1997, the age distribution of Bethlehem's inhabitants was 27.4% under the age of 10, 20% from 10 to 19, 17.3% from 20 to 29, 17.7% from 30 to 44, 12.1% from 45 to 64 and 5.3% above the age of 65. There were 11,079 males and 10,594 females. In the 2007 PCBS census, Bethlehem had a population of 25,266, of which 12,753 were males and 12,513 were females. There were 6,709 housing units, of which 5,211 were households. The average household consisted of 4.8 family members. By 2017, the population was 28,591.\n\nChristian population\nAfter the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 630s, the local Christians were Arabized even though large numbers were ethnically Arabs of the Ghassanid clans. Bethlehem's two largest Arab Christian clans trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids, including al-Farahiyyah and an-Najajreh. The former have descended from the Ghassanids who migrated from Yemen and from the Wadi Musa area in present-day Jordan and an-Najajreh descend from Najran. Another Bethlehem clan, al-Anatreh, also trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids.\nThe percentage of Christians in the town has been in a steady decline since the mid-twentieth century. In 1947, Christians made up 85% of the population, but by 1998, the figure had declined to 40%. In 2005, the mayor of Bethlehem, Victor Batarseh, explained that \"due to the stress, either physical or psychological, and the bad economic situation, many people are emigrating, either Christians or Muslims, but it is more apparent among Christians, because they already are a minority.\" The Palestinian Authority is officially committed to equality for Christians, although there have been incidents of violence against them by the Preventive Security Service and militant factions.\nIn 2006, a Zogby poll that interviewed more than 1,000 Palestinian Christians from Bethlehem found that 79% of the respondents cited the Israeli occupation as source of difficulties leading the emigration of their community. In the same year, the Palestinian Centre for Research and Cultural Dialogue conducted a poll among the city's Christians according to which 90% said they had had Muslim friends, 73.3% agreed that the PNA treated Christian heritage in the city with respect and 78% attributed the exodus of Christians to the Israeli blockade. The only mosque in the Old City is the Mosque of Omar, located in the Manger Square. By 2016, the Christian population of Bethlehem had declined to only 16%. The Christian population's proportion of Bethlehem fell from 87% in the 1950s to 12% in 2016.\nA study by Pew Research Center concluded that the decline in the Arab Christian population of the area was partially a result of a lower birth rate among Christians than among Muslims, but also partially due to the fact that Christians were more likely to emigrate from the region than any other religious group. The seizure of Christian land by Muslim mafias and the bias of the Palestinian Judicial system have been cited as reasons leading to emigration. Amon Ramnon, a researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, stated that the reason why more Christians were emigrating than Muslims is because it is easier for Arab Christians to integrate into western communities than for Arab Muslims, since many of them attend church-affiliated schools, where they are taught European languages. A higher percentage of Christians in the region are urban-dwellers, which also makes it easier for them to emigrate and assimilate into western populations. A statistical analysis of the Christian exodus cited lack of economic and educational opportunity, especially due to the Christians' middle-class status and higher education. Since the Second Intifada, 10% of the Christian population have left the city. However, it is likely that there are many other factors, most of which are shared with the Palestinian population as a whole.\n\nEconomy\nShopping is a major attraction, especially during the Christmas season. The city's main streets and old markets are lined with shops selling Palestinian handicrafts, Middle Eastern spices, jewelry and oriental sweets such as baklawa. Olive wood carvings are the item most purchased by tourists visiting Bethlehem. Religious handicrafts include ornaments handmade from mother-of-pearl, as well as olive wood statues, boxes, and crosses. Other industries include stone and marble-cutting, textiles, furniture and furnishings. Bethlehem factories also produce paints, plastics, synthetic rubber, pharmaceuticals, construction materials and food products, mainly pasta and confectionery.\nCremisan Wine, founded in 1885, is a winery run by monks in the Monastery of Cremisan. The grapes are grown mainly in the al-Khader district. In 2007, the monastery's wine production was around 700,000 liters per year.\nIn 2008, Bethlehem hosted the largest economic conference to date in the Palestinian territories. It was initiated by Palestinian Prime Minister and former Finance Minister Salam Fayyad to convince more than a thousand businessmen, bankers and government officials from throughout the Middle East to invest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A total of 1.4 billion US dollars was secured for business investments in the Palestinian territories. Tourism is Bethlehem's main industry. Unlike other Palestinian localities prior to 2000, the majority of the employed residents did not have jobs in Israel. More than 20% of the working population is employed in the industry. Tourism accounts for approximately 65% of the city's economy and 11% of the Palestinian National Authority. The city has more than two million visitors every year. Tourism in Bethlehem ground to a halt for over a decade after the Second Intifada, but gradually began to pick back up in the early 2010s. Schneider Electric operates a facility in the Multidisciplinary Industrial Park of Bethlehem, which was developed by the Palestinian government and France.\nThe Church of the Nativity is one of Bethlehem's major tourist attractions and a magnet for Christian pilgrims. It stands in the center of the city — a part of the Manger Square — over a grotto or cave called the Holy Crypt, where Jesus is believed to have been born. Nearby is the Milk Grotto where the Holy Family took refuge on their Flight to Egypt and next door is the cave where St. Jerome spent thirty years creating the Vulgate, the dominant Latin version of the Bible until the Reformation. There are over thirty hotels in Bethlehem. Jacir Palace, built in 1910 near the church, is one of Bethlehem's most successful hotels and its oldest. It was closed down in 2000 due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but reopened in 2005 as the Jacir Palace InterContinental at Bethlehem. The hotel is managed by world renowned international brand — the Intercontinental Hotel Group (IHG) and is second IHG hotel in the country after IHG in Jerusalem.\n\nReligious significance and commemoration\nBirthplace of Jesus\nIn the New Testament, the Gospel of Luke says that Jesus' parents traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. The Gospel of Matthew mentions Bethlehem as the place of birth, and adds that King Herod was told that a 'King of the Jews' had been born in the town, prompting Herod to order the killing of all the boys who were two years old or under in the town and surrounding area. Joseph, warned of Herod's impending action by an angel of the Lord, decided to flee to Egypt with his family and then later settled in Nazareth after Herod's death.\nEarly Christian traditions describe Jesus as being born in Bethlehem: in one account, a verse in the Book of Micah is interpreted as a prophecy that the Messiah would be born there. The second century Christian apologist Justin Martyr stated in his Dialogue with Trypho (written c. 155–161) that the Holy Family had taken refuge in a cave outside of the town and then placed Jesus in a manger. Origen of Alexandria, writing around the year 247, referred to a cave in the town of Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus. This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site of the cult of Tammuz. The Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Galilee. However, other archaeologists argue that there is evidence that Bethlehem of Judea was inhabited at that time. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.\n\nChristmas celebrations\nChristmas rites are held in Bethlehem on three different dates: December 25 is the traditional date by the Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations, but Greek, Coptic and Syrian Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on January 6 and Armenian Orthodox Christians on January 19. Most Christmas processions pass through Manger Square, the plaza outside the Basilica of the Nativity. Roman Catholic services take place in St. Catherine's Church and Protestants often hold services at Shepherds' Fields.\n\nOther religious festivals\nBethlehem celebrates festivals related to saints and prophets associated with Palestinian folklore. One such festival is the annual Feast of Saint George (al-Khadr) on May 5–6. During the celebrations, Greek Orthodox Christians from the city march in procession to the nearby town of al-Khader to baptize newborns in the waters around the Monastery of St. George and sacrifice a sheep in ritual. The Feast of St. Elijah is commemorated by a procession to Mar Elias, a Greek Orthodox monastery north of Bethlehem.\n\nCulture\nEmbroidery\nThe women embroiderers of Bethlehem were known for their bridalwear. Bethlehem embroidery was renowned for its \"strong overall effect of colors and metallic brilliance.\" Less formal dresses were made of indigo fabric with a sleeveless coat (bisht) from locally woven wool worn over top. Dresses for special occasions were made of striped silk with winged sleeves with a short taqsireh jacket known as the Bethlehem jacket. The taqsireh was made of velvet or broadcloth, usually with heavy embroidery.\n\nBethlehem work was unique in its use of couched gold or silver cord, or silk cord onto the silk, wool, felt or velvet used for the garment, to create stylized floral patterns with free or rounded lines. This technique was used for \"royal\" wedding dresses (thob malak), taqsirehs and the shatwehs worn by married women. It has been traced by some to Byzantium, and by others to the formal costumes of the Ottoman Empire's elite. As a Christian village, local women were also exposed to the detailing on church vestments with their heavy embroidery and silver brocade.\n\nMother-of-pearl carving\nThe art of mother-of-pearl carving is said to have been a Bethlehem tradition since the 15th century when it was introduced by Franciscan friars from Italy. A constant stream of pilgrims generated a demand for these items, which also provided jobs for women. The industry was noted by Richard Pococke, who visited Bethlehem in 1727.\n\nCultural centers and museums\nBethlehem is home to the Palestinian Heritage Center, established in 1991. The center aims to preserve and promote Palestinian embroidery, art and folklore. The International Center of Bethlehem is another cultural center that concentrates primarily on the culture of Bethlehem. It provides language and guide training, woman's studies and arts and crafts displays, and training.\n\nThe Bethlehem branch of the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music has about 500 students. Its primary goals are to teach children music, train teachers for other schools, sponsor music research, and the study of Palestinian folklore music.\nBethlehem has several museums: The Crib of the Nativity Theatre and Museum offers visitors 31 three-dimensional models depicting the significant stages of the life of Jesus. Its theater presents a 20-minute animated show. The Badd Giacaman Museum, located in the Old City of Bethlehem, dates back to the 18th century and is primarily dedicated to the history and process of olive oil production. Baituna al-Talhami Museum, established in 1972, contains displays of Bethlehem culture. The International Museum of Nativity was built by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to exhibit \"high artistic quality in an evocative atmosphere\". The Palestine Museum of Natural History is the first of its kind and is based on Bethlehem University campus.\n\nLocal government\nBethlehem is the muhfaza (seat) or district capital of the Bethlehem Governorate.\nBethlehem held its first municipal elections in 1876, after the mukhtars (\"heads\") of the quarters of Bethlehem's Old City (excluding the Syriac Quarter) made the decision to elect a local council of seven members to represent each clan in the town. A Basic Law was established so that if the victor for mayor was a Catholic, his deputy should be of the Greek Orthodox community.\n\nThroughout, Bethlehem's rule by the British and Jordan, the Syriac Quarter was allowed to participate in the election, as were the Ta'amrah Bedouins and Palestinian refugees, hence ratifying the number of municipal members in the council to 11. In 1976, an amendment was passed to allow women to vote and become council members and later the voting age was increased from 21 to 25.\nThere are several branches of political parties on the council, including Communist, Islamist, and secular. The leftist factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Palestinian People's Party (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. Hamas gained the majority of the open seats in the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections.\n\nMayors\nIn the October 2012 municipal elections, Fatah member Vera Baboun won, becoming the first female mayor of Bethlehem.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, approximately 84% of Bethlehem's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 10,414 were enrolled in schools (4,015 in primary school, 3,578 in secondary and 2,821 in high school). About 14.1% of high school students received diplomas. There were 135 schools in the Bethlehem Governorate in 2006; 100 run the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, seven by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 28 were private.\n\nBethlehem is home to Bethlehem University, a Catholic Christian co-educational institution of higher learning founded in 1973 in the Lasallian tradition, open to students of all faiths. Bethlehem University is the first university established in the West Bank, and can trace its roots to 1893 when the De La Salle Christian Brothers opened schools throughout Palestine and Egypt.\n\nTransportation\nBethlehem has three bus stations owned by private companies which offer service to Jerusalem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahour, Hebron, Nahalin, Battir, al-Khader, al-Ubeidiya and Beit Fajjar. There are two taxi stations that make trips to Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, Jerusalem, Tuqu' and Herodium. There are also two car rental departments: Murad and 'Orabi. Buses and taxis with West Bank licenses are not allowed to enter Israel, including Jerusalem, without a permit.\nThe Israeli construction of the West Bank barrier has affected Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier is located along the northern side of the town's built-up area, within distance of houses in the Aida refugee camp on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other. Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration to the rest of the West Bank are currently subjected to Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical Solomon's Pools.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nBethlehem is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nBethlehem of Galilee\nBethlehem, Pennsylvania\nBethlehem, Wales\nStar of Bethlehem\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nBethlehem Municipality\nWelcome To The City of Bethlehem\nOpen Bethlehem civil society project Archived April 19, 2010, at the Wayback Machine\nPhoto: Christmas in Bethlehem, 2008 Archived November 23, 2017, at the Wayback Machine\nBethlehem Fair Trade Artisans\nBethlehem University\nBethlehem aerial photo, Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem",
      "summary": "Bethlehem is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, located about ten kilometres (six miles) south of Jerusalem, and the capital of the Bethlehem Governorate. It had a population of 28,591 people, as of 2017. The city's economy is strongly linked to tourism, especially during the Christmas period, when Christians embark on a pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, which is revered as the location of the birth of Jesus.\nA possible first mention of Bethlehem is in the Amarna correspondence of ancient Egypt, dated to 1350–1330 BCE, although that reading is uncertain. In the Hebrew Bible, the period of the Israelites is described; it identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of David. In the New Testament, the city is identified as the birthplace of Jesus of Nazareth. Under the Roman Empire, the city of Bethlehem was destroyed by Hadrian, but later rebuilt by Constantine the Great, who commissioned the Church of the Nativity in 327 CE. In 529, the Church of the Nativity was heavily damaged by Samaritans involved in the Samaritan revolts; following the victory of the Byzantine Empire, it was rebuilt by Justinian I.\nLater, during the rule of several Caliphates, Bethlehem became part of Jund Filastin in 637. Muslims continued to rule the city until 1099, when it was conquered by the Crusaders, who replaced the local Christian Greek Orthodox clergy with Catholic ones. In the mid-13th century, Bethlehem's walls were demolished by the Mamluk Sultanate. However, they were rebuilt by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century when it came to control the region. After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Bethlehem was part of Mandatory Palestine until 1948, and later of the West Bank that was annexed by Jordan following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Bethlehem was occupied by Israel along with the rest of the West Bank. Since the Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority, Bethlehem has been designated as part of Area A of the West Bank, nominally rendering it as being under Palestinian control, but it remains under Israeli occupation. Movement around the city is limited due to the Israeli West Bank barrier.\nHistorically, it was a city of Arab Christians, who made up about 86% of the population in 1950, but this community has dwindled significantly to 10% as of 2022, and now has a majority of Arab Muslims.",

      "content": "بَيْت لَحم (بالسريانيه: ܒܝܬ ܠܚܡ؛ باليونانيه: Βηθλεὲμ؛ باللاتينيه: Bethleem) هي مدينه فلسطينيه، ومركز محافظه بيت لحم. تقع في الضفه الغربيه التابعه للسلطه الفلسطينيه على بعد 10 كم الى الجنوب من القدس. يبلغ عدد سكانها 30,000 نسمه بدون سكان مخيمات اللاجئين. وتعتبر مركزاً للثقافه والسياحه في فلسطين.\nللمدينه اهميه عظيمه لدى المسيحيين لكونها مسقط راس يسوع (عيسى). تضم بيت لحم العديد من الكنائس، ولعل اهمها كنيسه المهد، التي بنيت على يد قسطنطين الاكبر (330 م). وقد بنيت الكنيسه فوق كهف او مغاره يعتقد انها مذود البقر الذي ولد فيه يسوع. ويعتقد ان هذه الكنيسه هي اقدم الكنائس الموجوده في العالم. كما ان هناك سرداباً اخر قريب يعتقد ان جيروم قضى فيه ثلاثين عاماً من حياته يترجم الكتاب المقدس.\nبنيت المدينه وفقًا لعلماء الاثار على يد الكنعانيين في الالف الثاني قبل الميلاد، وعُرفت بعدد من الاسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسمها في مصادر قدماء السريان والاراميين. وقد مرَّ على المدينه عدد من الغزاه عبر التاريخ، حيث تعرّضت بيت لحم هي وبقيه فلسطين للفتح الاشوري والبابلي والفارسي والاغريقي والروماني والبيزنطي. واُعيد بناؤها من قبل الامبراطور البيزنطي جستنيان الاول. وفتحها العرب المسلمون على يد عمر بن الخطاب عام 637م. وفي عام 1099م، احتلها الصليبيون الذين حصنوها واستبدلوا فيها الارثوذكسيه اليونانيه برجال الدين اللاتين. وقد طُرد هؤلاء رجال الدين اللاتين بعد ان فتح المدينه صلاح الدين الايوبي. ومع مجيء المماليك في عام 1250م، هُدمت جدران المدينه واعيد بناؤها في وقت لاحق خلال حكم الامبراطوريه العثمانيه. في عام 1917 انتزعت بريطانيا السيطره على المدينه من العثمانيين خلال الحرب العالميه الاولى وكان من المفترض ان تُضمّن في المنطقه الدوليه في اطار خطه الامم المتحده لتقسيم فلسطين عام 1947. واُلحقت المدينه بالاردن بعد نكبه فلسطين عام 1948. وقد احتلتها اسرائيل في عام 1967 بحرب الايام السته. ومنذ عام 1995، ووفقاً لاتفاقيه اوسلو، نُقلت السلطات المدنيه والامنيه في المدينه الى يد السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه.\nتقع بيت لحم ضمن سلسله جبال القدس، وترتفع عن سطح البحر 775 متراً. وتعتبر المدينه تاريخياً منطقه مسيحيه السكان، الا ان معظم سكانها اليوم هم من المسلمين، ولكنها لا زالت موطناً لواحد من اكبر المجتمعات المسيحيه الفلسطينيه.\nلبيت لحم دور رئيس في القطاع الاقتصادي الفلسطيني من خلال السياحه التي تزداد اثناء موسم عيد الميلاد عندما يحتشد الحجاج المسيحيون الى كنيسه المهد، حيث يوجد في بيت لحم اكثر من 30 فندقاً و 300 ورشه عمل للحرف اليدويه. ويسكن هذه المدينه احد اقدم المجتمعات المسيحيه في العالم على الرغم من تقلص حجمه بسبب الهجره. اختيرت المدينه عاصمه الثقافه العربيه للعام 2020. وسجّلت مدينه بيت لحم اول اصابات بفايروس كورونا التاجي «كوفيد-19» لتصبح اول مدينه تغلق في فلسطين لمده زادت عن 70 يوماً.\n\nالتسميه\nكان يقع ضمن موقعها مکان عباده كنعاني يدعى بیراث اربع او برج اربع، باسم جد الكنعانيين، فتوارث الاسرائيليون المكان والتقاليد فقدموا الذبائح لالههم يهوه في برج اربع، ويعزو البعض تسميه المدينه بيت لحم بسبب وجود مائده التقدمه في هذا المكان (صموئيل الاول 9 : 12، 20 : 6، 6 : 29) - ویسمی تلمود اورشلیم المغاره الكبيره في افراتا باسم جد الادوميين والعرب الذين ينتمي لهم الكميتيون والكنسينيون وينتسب لهم كالب، فيُقرا في \"مدراش ایکا رباني\" (68 : 3) \"في ببرات اربع في اليهوديه ياتي المسيا للعالم\". وتشير الملاحظه التابعه ان پيرات اربع هي مكان في بيت لحم وتدعي كذلك \"بيرات ملكا\" نسبه الى برج الملك. وتذكر \"اخبار الايام الاولى في التوراه (11 : 16) \"وكان داود حينئذ، في الحصن بينما جنود الفلسطينيين يحاصرون بيت لحم\".\nوذكر نومكينز في مجله مؤسسه الاثار الفلسطينيه الربع سنويه  ان المكان كان مرکراً لاله الخصب الكلداني «لاحمو» وذكرته رسائل تل العمارنه باسم بیت ايلي لاحاما. وكان الكنعانيون يقيمون البيوت لالهتهم اينما اعتقدوا بوجودها وكانت منطقه بيت لحم بسيولها الخصبه اهلا ان يسكنها اله الخصب. فبنوا له معبدا يطل على السيول دعي «بيت ايلي لاحاما» الذي بقي على مر العصور وتقلب الشعوب. واي اسم اجدر واقدس من اسم اله لتحافظ عليه وتحترمه وتتوارته الاقوام اللاحقه. كما ذكر المؤرخ الالماني، و.شريدر في جريده الاداب الشرقيه عدد 18 لعام 1915م عن صفائح رسائل تل العمارنه ان هذا الراي في التسميه قد ثبت وتمكن. بينما التفسيرات العبرانيه لاسم بیت لحم ببيت الخبز فهي شعبيه ترکت نهائيا.\nظهر راي يتردد في المراجع بالرغم من عدم صحته وهو ان قبيله عربيه تدعم لخم سكنت هذه المنطقه، بعد نزوحها من الجزيره العربيه خمسمئه عام قبل الميلاد عندما نزح المنائيون ولحق بهم قبیلتا لخم وجذام، فسكن اللخميون الصحراء ما بين الرمله ومصر وقسم منهم في الجولان وحوران وباسان حتى مدينه نوا، اما الجذامیون فسكنوا غور الاردن من طبريا حتى اللجون، يمون وعكا، ويكفي النظر الى تاريخ النزوح لننفي اي علاقه باسم بيت لحم الذي ذكر قبل 1800 عام قبل الميلاد. وليس لدوله اللخميين في الحيره في العراق كذلك اي علاقه لتسميه بيت لحم. اذ ظهرت دوله اللخميين حوالي القرن الخامس ميلادي فقط.\nودُعيت ببيت لحم بافراتا وهي كلمه كلدانيه معناها الخصبه (تكوين 35 : 16، 19) (منيحا 5 : 2) (راعوت 4)، وذكر المورخ اليهودي يوسفوس فلافيوس\" ان راحيل\nدفنت في بلاد افراتا\". وجدير بالذكر ان القمح البري وجد في هذه المنطقه.\nوبني الكنعانيون بيتا اخر «لايلي لاحاما» في شمال البلاد في الجليل الى الشمال الغربي من مدينه الناصره وعلى بعد احد عشر كيلومترا منها، ذكرتها التوراه عده مرات ولربما كانت اكثر اهميه من بيت لحم الجنوب لخصب محیطها وغنى اهلها. وكانت تابعه لسبط زبلون زمن الاسرائيليين: (يشوع 19 : 10)، (قضاه 12 : 8) \nشيد الالمان الهيكليون قريتهم ببيت لحم على اثار بیت لحم القديمه عام 1901م، وبقيت مزدهره حتى احتلها اليهود عام 1948 لتصبح يهوديه، وللتفرقه عرفت بيت لحم الجنوبيه باليهوديه والشماليه ببيت لحم الجليل.\nوبظهور النبي داوود في بيت لحم الصغرى بزغ اسمها من الظلمه الى النور، اذ جاء صموئيل النبي الى بيت لحم ليصبح ابن يسي الاصغر ملكا على اليهود (صموئيل الاول 16 : 1). وفي يوم التقدمه عند اليهود سكب صموئيل الزيت من الفرن على راس داوود واخذ اسم هذا يعلو على اسم شاول الملك انذاك فامتلا حقدا عليه. ويذكر (صموئيل الاول 20 : 29) کیف اختبا داوود من شاول خوفا منه اذ حاول قتله. واعتذر یوناشاس ابن شاول لابيه عن صديقه داوود لعدم حضوره وليمه الملك بانه ذهب الى بيت لحم بمناسبه راس الشهر القمري ليقدم الذبيحه مع اهله: وتقديم الذبيحه على هيكل مقدس، طقس، لا بد وان الاسرائيليون توارثوه عن الكنعانين - بنت ايلي لاحاما. ويعتقد ان هذا البيت المقدس كان يطل على السهول الخصبه والصحراء الشرقيه حيث تقوم اليوم المقدسات المسيحيه، حيث اشتعلت نيران التقدمه لترضي ايلي لاحاما الكنعاني وثم التهمت النيران قرابين الاسرائيليين لترضي الاههم يهوه، ثم جاءت المسيحيه فالوثنيه فالمسيحيه ثانيه لتشيد مقدساتها على انقاض المقدسات السالفه.\n\nودعي داود بابن يسى الافراتي (صموئيل الاول 17 : 12)  وينسب اليمالك والد زوج راعوث الى هذا النسب ايضا (راعوث 1 : 2) ولما تزوج بوعاز التلحمي من راعوث الارمله تمني له مواطنوه «ان يزدهر بيتها في افراتا ويشتهر في بيت لحم» (راعوت 4 : 11)  وانجبت راعوثم بن بوعاز ابنا هو عوبید والد يسی والد داوود. فاصبح اسم هذا النسل مربتوا باسم بيت لحم، وذكر ميخا في نبواته (5 : 2) حوالي 750 عام قبل الميلاد: «اما ات يا بيت لحم افراته وانت صغيره ان تكوني بين اوف يهوذا، فمنك يخرج لي الذي يكون متسلطا على اسرائيل ومخارجه منذ القديم، منذ ايام الازل» \nكذلك ذكر في (اخبار الايام الاولى 2 : 19، 24، 50) ان هذا النسل الذي كان يسكن محيط بيت لحم (بيت افرات) ينسب دائما لافراتا. وكل هذا يشهد ان الاسم افراتا اطلق على المنطقه التي مركزها بيت لحم.\n\nالتاريخ\nالعهد الكنعاني\nلقد سكن الكنعانيون المدينه سنه 2000 ق.م، ويروى ان النبي يعقوب جاء الى هذه المدينه وهو في طريقه الى الخليل، وماتت زوجته راحيل في مكان قريب من بيت لحم يعرف اليوم بقبه راحيل وفي بيت لحم ولد الملك داوود. وتوالت عليها الاحداث، وكانت في العصور القديمه قريه متواضعه تكتنفها الاوديه العميقه من جهاتها الثلاث. وكانت خصبه الموقع تنتشر فيها حقول القمح. وفي القرن الرابع عشر قبل الميلاد -\tظهرت في مخطوطات تل العمارنه منطقه اسمها بيت لحم وذلك عند الحديث عن انباء الحروب التي قامت جنوب القدس. من المحتمل ان اول استيطان بشري وقع فيها عندما حطت بعض جماعات من البدو حول النبع الواقع على بعد 200 متر من كنيسه الميلاد.\nتظهرُ اول اشاره تاريخيه الى المدينه في رسائل تل العمارنه (حوالي 1400 قبل الميلاد) عندما ناشد ملك القدس سيده الاعلى، ملك مصر، للحصول على المُساعده لاستعاده السيطره على «بيت - لحمي» في اعقاب الاضطرابات من جانب عبيرو. ويعتقد ان تشابه هذا الاسم مع شكلها الحديث يدُل على انها كانت مُستوطنه كنعانيه، الذين يملُكون ثقافيه ولغويه ساميه مع الوافدين على المدينه لاحقًا.\n\nبعد الميلاد\nفي عام 325 بعد اعلان حريه التعبد للديانه المسيحيه، طلب القديس مكاريوس بطريرك القدس من الامبراطور ان يعيد المكان المقدس، فبنت القديسه هيلانه بازيليك الميلاد. في عام 384 مع وصول القديس هيرونيموس الى بيت لحم قام في المدينه مركز عباده لاتيني دام بعد وفاته سنين عديده. في عام 614 ادّى غزو جيوش كسرى الى خراب اليهوديه ولم ينج من بيت لحم سوى بازيليك الميلاد وذلك كما يقال بفضل رسم للمجوس قائم على جدار البازيليك. والمجوس وهم ملوك الفرس الذين سجدوا ليسوع الطفل بحسب الروايه الانجيليه.\n\nاستمدت بيت لحم شهرتها العالميه الكبرى من مولد يسوع فيها. ويروى ان يوسف النجار، ومريم العذراء ذهبا الى بيت لحم لتسجيل اسمهما في الاحصاء العام، فولدت مريم وليدها هناك. وترى المصادر المسيحيه ان الولاده كانت في مغاره قريبه من القريه، ولكن القران (يقول): (فاجاها المخاض الى جذع النخله) وفي سنه 330 م بنت هيلانه ام قسطنطين الكبير، كنيسه فوق المغاره التي قيل ان يسوع ولد فيها، وهي اليوم اقدم كنيسه في العالم. والمغاره تقع داخل كنيسه الميلاد، ومنحوته في صخر كلسي، وتحتوي على غرفتين صغيرتين، وفي الشماليه منها بلاطه رخاميه، منزل منها نجمه فضيه، حيث يقال ان يسوع ولد هناك. وعندما دخل عمر بن الخطاب القدس، توجه الى بيت لحم، وفيها اعطى سكانها امانًا خطيًا على ارواحهم واولادهم وممتلكاتهم وكنائسهم. ولما حان وقت الصلاه، صلى باشاره من راهب، امام الحنيه الجنوبيه للكنيسه، التي اخذ المسلمون يقيمون فيها صلواتهم، فرادى، وجعل الخليفه على النصارى اسراجها وتنظيفها. وهكذا صار المسلمون والمسيحيون يقيمون صلواتهم جنباً الى جنب.\nتذكر بيت لحم في العهد الجديد باعتبارها مكان ميلاد يسوع: «ولما ولد يسوع في بيت لحم اليهوديه» (مت 2: 1 5، لو 2: 4 15)، ونتيجه لذلك حدثت مذبحه الاطفال الابرياء بامر هيرودس الملك (مت 2: 8 و16). وحيث ان هادريان قد جرب بيت لحم تماما، واقام في موضعها نصبا مقدسا للاله «ادونيس»، فلابد ان تكريم تلك المدينه باعتبارها مكان ميلاد يسوع، يرجع الي ما قبل عصر هادريان (132 م). وقد اقام قسطنطين الملك (حوالي 330 م) كنيسه على الطراز الروماني فوق موقع كهف المذود الذي شهد مولد يسوع. وتعتبر هذه الكنيسه حتى اليوم اهم مقصد للسياح، في المدينه. وهي لم يطرا عليها تغيير كبير، رغم ان جستنيان قد وسع فيها وزينها، ورغم ما تعرضت له من تهدم وترميم.\n\nالحكم العربي الاسلامي\nفي سنه 648 م دخلت المدينه تحت الحكم الاسلامي، وزارها الخليفه عمر بن الخطاب الذي لم يصلّ داخل كنيسه المهد، خوفاً من ان تحدث نزاعات في المستقبل على الكنيسه بين المسلمين والمسيحيين حيث صلى بجانبها. وكانت المدينه قد اُلحقت بجند فلسطين التابع لولايه الشام بعد ان تم فتح جميع اراضي بلاد الشام على يد عدد من القاده منهم عمرو بن العاص وابو عبيده بن الجراح.\nيشار الى انه تم بناء مسجد في بيت لحم عام 1860 وهو مسجد عمر نسبه للخليفه عمر بن الخطاب، والذي تم ترميمه حتى العام 1954 تحت الاداره الاردنيه للمدينه. وكانت الارض التي تم بناء المسجد عليها تم التبرع بها من قبل الكنيسه الارثوذكسيه اليونانيه.\nوقد عاش ابناء الديانتين المسيحيه والاسلاميه في هذه المدينه بروح من الاخاء والتعاون وتمارس كل فيهما شعائرها الدينيه ونشاطاتها الاقتصاديه الاجتماعيه على الرغم من ان المدينه تعرضت لفترات من المد والجزر حسب الحكم القائم، ومن اكثر العهود ازدهارًا بالنسبه لبيت لحم هو زمن هارون الرشيد 786-809 م والدوله الفاطميه 952-1094 م، حيث راجت التجاره وتيسرت الحريه والامن ورممت الكنائس واماكن العباده.\n\nالحروب الصليبيه\nفي 1099 دخلت المدينه تحت الحكم الصليبي بعد ان دخلها الجيش الصليبي بقياده تانكرد فدمر المدينه واحرقها ولم يتبق منها الا كنيسه المهد. لم يكتف الصليبيون بما حازوا عليه، فقاموا بتوسيع حدود المملكه، ومع اواخر يوليو 1099 غزوا شمال فلسطين، ثم وصل جيش الفاطميين في 12 اغسطس فالتقى وجيش المملكه الوليده في عسقلان، واحرز الصليبيون نصرًا هامًا ضمن لهم السيطره على الساحل الفلسطيني؛ وقد دار خلاف بين امراء المملكه حول طبيعه الدوله بين كونها دوله دينيه يحكمها اسقفها ديبامرت مبعوث البابا، او دوله مدنيه يحكمها جودفري، واتفق اخيرًا على كونها دوله مدنيه وذلك بمباركه ديبامبرت مبعوث البابا الى المملكه، رغم ان طموحه هذا عاد للظهور بعد وفاه جودفري. عام 1100 توفي جودفري بنتيجه المرض، وخلفه شقيقه بالدوين الاول المتحدر من بولونيا وقد انتخب في 11 نوفمبر وتمّ التتويج في بيت لحم يوم 25 ديسمبر 1100 وهو يوم عيد الميلاد، بعد تنافس مع تانكرد والاسقف ديامبرت حول وراثه العرش، وقد تم ارضاء تانكرد بمنحه اماره انطاكيه بعد اسر اميرها في حلب. اما بالدوين فكان اول من خلع عليه لقب «ملك المملكه اللاتينيه في القدس»، ما شكل ترسيخًا لهويه الدوله الجديده، وقد قسمت الدوله الى اربع مطرانيات وابرشيات عديده تحت سلطه بطريرك القدس.\nوقد دام الحكم الصليبي لبيت لحم حتى عام 1187 حيث عادت لاصحابها بعد انتصار المسلمين بقياده صلاح الدين الايوبي على الصليبين في معركه حطين. وفي عام 1229 عادت مدينه بيت لحم لحكم الصليبين بموجب الاتفاقيه التي وقعت بين ممثلي الخليفه الكامل فخر الدين وامير اربيل صلاح الدين وممثلي الامبراطور فريدريك. لكنهم فقدوها نهائيا بعد عده سنين فقط.\n\nالعهد المملوكي والعثماني\nفي عام 1244 تمكن المسلمون بقياده نجم الدين من استعاده المدينه بشكل نهائي، قام بعدها الظاهر بيبرس بدخول المدينه عام 1263 ودمرا ابراجها وهدم اسوارها، وفي عام 1517 دخلت المدينه تحت الحكم العثماني، وبعد تطور وسائل النقل والمواصلات تحولت المدينه الى مركز جذب هام للحجاج القادمين من اوروبا وانعكست اثاره على الاوضاع في المدينه وازدهرت صناعه الصوف والخزف وغيرها الا ان سوء الاوضاع الاقتصاديه دفع بالكثير من ابناء المدينه الى الهجره خارجها.\nفي القرن التاسع عشر - ومع بدايه القرن الماضي اخذت المدينه بالنمو خاصه على ايدي المسيحيين الذين كانوا يشكلون الاكثريه العظمى. في عام 1831، عندما احتل محمد علي باشا مصر المدينه، طرد المسلمون المسيحيين وامر الباشا بهدم حيّهم. وبعد عشره ايام اعاد الاتراك بناءه.\nمن 1831 الى 1841، كانت فلسطين تحت حكم اسره محمد علي من مصر. خلال هذه الفتره، عانت المدينه من الزلازل الذي ضربها، فضلًا عن تدمير القوات المصريه لحي مسلم في عام 1834، على ما يبدو انتقامًا لمقتل احد الموالين لرعايه ابراهيم باشا. في عام 1841، اصبحت بيت لحم تحت سيطره الحكم العثماني مره اخرى وظلت كذلك حتى نهايه الحرب العالميه الاولى. في العهد العثماني، من المشاكل التي واجهتها سكان بيت لحم البطاله والخدمه العسكريه الاجباريه والضرائب الثقيله، مما ادى الى هجره جماعيه خاصه الى اميركا الجنوبيه.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عام 1917، سقطت بيت لحم بيد الجيش الانجليزي، ودخلت المدينه مع باقي مدن فلسطين مظله الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين عام 1920، واصبحت جزءا من فلسطين في فتره الانتداب البريطاني وتم اضافتها الى المنطقه المدوّله عندما اصدرت الامم المتحده قرار تقسيم فلسطين الى دولتين عربيه ويهوديه عام 1947، ولكن قام الاردن بضمها مع سائر مناطق الضفه الغربيه عام 1951. وبقيت تحت الحكم الاردني حتى حرب 1967.\nارتفعت درجه بيت لحم الاداريه بعد ان كانت (ناحيه) في العهد العثماني الى (قضاء) في العهد البريطاني، يقع بين اقضيه القدس والخليل واريحا. وبقي كذلك لعام 1944 م حيث الغي هو وقضاء اريحا والحقا بقضاء القدس. فكان ذلك اخر تغيير اداري قامت به الحكومه البريطانيه في فلسطين.\nقرار التقسيم\n\nقامت هيئه الامم المتحده عام 1947 بمحاوله لايجاد حل الصراع العربي الاسرائيلي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئه الامم بتشكيل لجنه UNSCOP المتالّفه من دول متعدّده باستثناء الدّول دائمه العضويه لضمان الحياد في عمليه ايجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنه بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الاول باقامه دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينه القدس من قِبل اداره دوليه. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تاسيس فيدراليه تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهوديه والعربيه. ومال معظم افراد لجنه UNSCOP تجاه المشروع الاول والرامي لتاسيس دولتين مستقلّتين باطار اقتصدي موحد. وقامت هيئه الامم بقبول مشروع لجنه UNSCOP الدّاعي للتقسيم مع اجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركه بين الدولتين، العربيه واليهوديه، على ان يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nاعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من ارض فلسطين للدوله اليهوديه، وشملت حصّه اليهود من ارض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من اسدود الى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينه يافا) واغلبيه مساحه صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينه بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصريه). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحه للزراعه ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الارض الفلسطينيه على اماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهوديه بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدوله اليهوديه. وكان نصيب بيت لحم ان يتم الحاقها بالمنطقه المدوله مع القدس.\n\nالحكم الاردني\nومع باقي الضفه الغربيه دخلت المدينه في عام 1951 في اتحاد مع المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه، واصبحت في عام 1964 مركزاً لمحافظه بيت لحم. وبقيت تحت الحكم الاردني حتى احتلالها في حرب 1967 او النكسه.\n\nالنكسه\nسقطت المدينه في يد اسرائيل بعد عام 1967، لتظل تحت الاحتلال لمده 27 سنه وتعاني من الاهمال الاسرائيلي لها كباقي المدن العربيه الفلسطينيه المحتله. وقد صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات شائعه من اراضي بيت لحم واقامت عليها العديد من المستوطنات.\nفي عام 1987، انخرط سكان مدينه بيت لحم بوقت مبكر في الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الاولى. وكانت القياده الوطنيه الموحده للانتفاضه، تقوم بتوزيع النشرات الاسبوعيه في شوارع بيت لحم مع جدول زمني للاضراب المتصاحب مع الاحتجاجات اليوميه ضد الدوريات الاسرائيليه في المدينه. وفي المظاهرات، تم احراق الاطارات في الشوارع، كما القى الحشود الحجاره والزجاجات الحارقه على جنود الاحتلال. ورد الجيش الاسرائيلي بالغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي. واغلقت المدارس في مدينه بيت لحم قسرا، وفتحت تدريجيا لبضع ساعات. ونفذت الاعتقالات خارج البيوت، وفرض حظر التجول ومنع السفر، ما اعتبره الفلسطينيون بانه عقاب جماعي. ردا على اغلاق المدارس، وتنظيم دورات تعليم سكان المنزل لمساعده الطلاب على استدراك الماده الفائته، وهذا اصبح واحدا من الرموز القليله من العصيان المدني.\n\nالسلطه الفلسطينيه\nفي 21 ديسمبر 1995، انسحبت القوات الاسرائيليه من بيت لحم، وبعد ثلاثه ايام اصبحت المدينه تحت اداره السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه وسيطرتُها العسكريه الكامله بناءً على الاتفاق الانتقالي بشان الضفه الغربيه وقطاع غزه في عام 1995. واصبحت المدينه مُنذ ذلك الحين، مركزاً لمحافظه بيت لحم، كما وقعت معظم اراضي المحافظه ضمن تصنيف (ا) و (ب) حسب اتفاق اوسلو.\nخلال الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه، في 2000-2001، تضررت بشده البنيه التحتيه في بيت لحم والسياحه. وفي عام 2002، كانت المدينه منطقه القتال الرئيسيه في عمليه الدرع الواقي، عمليه عسكريه كبرى من جانب الجيش الاسرائيلي.\nخلال العمليه، قام الجيش الاسرائيلي بمُحاصره كنيسه المهد، حيث كان حوالي 200 مسلح فلسطيني لجاوا الى الكنيسه. واستمر الحصار لمده 39 يومًا وقتلوا تسعه من المسلحين ورجل كنيسي. انتهى الحصار باتفاق على نفي 13 من المسلحين المطلوبين الى دول اوروبيه مختلفه وموريتانيا.\n\nالاهميه الدينيه\nلبيت لحم اهميه عظيمه لدى المسيحيين لكونها مسقط راس يسوع (عيسى). في بيت لحم العديد من الكنائس، ولعل اهمها كنيسه المهد، التي بنيت على يد قسطنطين الاكبر (330 م). وذلك فوق كهف او مغاره، والتي يعتقد انها الاسطبل الذي ولد فيه يسوع. يعتقد ان هذه الكنيسه هي اقدم الكنائس الموجوده في العالم. كما ان هناك سرداب اخر قريب يعتقد ان جيروم قد قضى ثلاثين عاما من حياته فيه يترجم الكتاب المقدس.\n\nيفهم من هذا النص ان يوسف ومريم لم يجدا لهما مكانا في منزل كمهام المعروف في بيت لحم فنزلا في مغاره تاوي اليها البهائم ويروي متى الانجيلي انه بعد ولاده يسوع، قام بعض المجوس من الشرق بزياره هيرودس للاستعلام عن مكان «الشخص الذي ولد ملكا لليهود»، لانهم راوا نجمه في الشرق. كان هيرودس، ملك اليهود، قلقًا من احتمال ان يفقد عرشه. قام هيرودس بتجميع رؤساء الكهنه وكتّاب الشعب وسالهم اين وُلد «الممسوح» (المسيح، باليونانيه: Ὁ Χριστός، هو كريستوس). اجابوا: في بيت لحم، حيث تنبا ميخا قبل سبعمئه وخمسين عاما عن قدومه «وانت يا بيت لحم ارض يهوذا لست الصغرى بین روساء يهوذا لان منك يخرج مدبر يرعی شعبي اسرائيل». ارسل هيرودس المجوس الى بيت لحم، وامرهم بالبحث عن الطفل، وبعد ان يعثروا عليه، «ان يخبروه عنه، حتى يذهب هو ايضاً ليعبده». وقدم المجوس الى بيت لحم وقدّموا للمولود هدايا من ذهب ولبان ومر. وانصرفوا من طريق اخر مارین بحقل الرعاه شرقا كي لا يقابلوا هيرودس الذي ظنوا فيه شرا بعد ان تم تحذيرهم في حلم بعدم ابلاغ هيرودس. وبالمثل، تم تحذير يوسف في حلم ان هيرودس كان يعتزم قتل يسوع، لذلك فر هو وعائلته الى مصر. عندما ادرك هيرودس انه قد خدع، اصدر اوامر بقتل جميع الاولاد الذين تقل اعمارهم عن سنتين في بيت لحم والمناطق المجاوره لها من ابن عامين فما دون لعله يقتل الطفل المولود بينهم. بقي يوسف وعائلته في مصر حتى وفاه هيرودس، ثم انتقلوا الى الناصره في الجليل لتجنب العيش تحت حكم ارخيلاوس ابن هيرودس.\nتُذكر روايه الميلاد في انجيلي متى ولوقا، وتغدوا الروايه في انجيل لوقا اكثر تفصيلاً؛ عناصر الروايه الانجيليه للميلاد مفادها ان مريم قد ظهر لها جبرائيل مرسلاً من قبل الله واخبرها انها ستحبل بقوّه الروح القدس بطفل «يكون عظيمًا وابن العلي يدعى، ولن يكون لملكه نهايه»،لوقا 1/32] وعندما اضطرب يوسف النجار خطيب مريم من روايتها ظهر له الملاك ايضًا في الحلم تصديقًا لروايه مريم وتشجيعًا له، ويتفق متى ولوقا ان الميلاد قد تمّ في بيت لحم مدينه النبي داود لا في مدينه الناصره حيث كانا يعيشان وحيث تمت البشاره، يعود ذلك تتميمًا للنبؤات السابقه حول مكان الميلاد سيّما نبؤه النبي ميخا، اما السبب المباشر فهو طلب اغسطس قيصر احصاء سكان الامبراطوريه الرومانيه تمهيدًا لدفع الضرائب، ولذلك سافر يوسف مع مريم وكان حينها قد ضمها الى بيته كزوجته دون ان تنشا بينهما علاقه زوجيه، وعند وصولهما الى بيت لحم لم يجدا مكانًا للاقامه في فندق او نزل وحان وقت وضع مريم، فبحسب انجيل لوقا وضعت طفلها في مذود ولفته بقماط.لوقا 2/7] وان ذكر المذود هو الدافع الاساسي للاعتقاد بوجود المغاره او الحظيره، لان الحظائر عاده كانت عباره عن كهوف اما المذود فهو مكان وضع علف الحيوانات، وكان اوريجانوس قد اثبت المغاره وقال انه نقل القصه عن تقاليد اقدم.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع بيت لحم 31°43′0″N 35°12′0″E وعلى ارتفاع حوالي 775 متر (2,543 قدم) فوق مستوى سطح البحر، 30 مترا (98 قدم) اعلى من القدس. بيت لحم وتقع في الجزء الجنوبي من جبال الخليل.\nتقع المدينه على بعد 10 كيلومترات (6.2 ميل) الى الجنوب من القدس، 73 كيلومترًا (45 ميل) شمال شرق قطاع غزه والبحر المتوسط، و 75 كيلومترًا (47 ميل) الى الغرب من عمان عاصمه الاردن، و 59 كيلومترًا (37 ميل) الى الجنوب الشرقي من تل ابيب وعلى بعد 10 كيلومترات (6.2 ميل) الى الجنوب من القدس.\n\nمن المدن والبلدات القريبه تشمل بيت صفافا والقدس في الشمال، وبيت جالا الى الشمال الغربي، حوسان الى الغرب، الخضر وارطاس الى الجنوب الغربي، وبيت ساحور الى الشرق. وتقع بيت جالا، وبيت ساحور تُشكل تجمع مع بيت لحم وتقع مخيمات اللاجئين عايده ومخيم بيت جبرين داخل حدود المدينه.\nتقع البلده القديمه في وسط المدينه، وتتالف من ثمانيه ارباع سكنيه (احياء)، المبنيه باسلوب الفسيفساء التي تشكل المنطقه المحيطه ساحه كنيسه المهد. الارباع تضمُ المسيحيين وربع واحد فقط يضمُ مسلمين. سُميت معظم الاحياء المسيحيه حسب اسماء عشائر الغساسنه العربيه التي استقرت هُناك. وشكل المغتربين العرب المسيحيين حي القواوسه الذين اتوا من تقوع في القرن الثامن عشر. هُناك ايضًا ربع السريانيه يقع خارج البلده القديمه، تعود اصول سكانها من مديات وماسارتي «وMa'asarte» في تركيا. يبلغ عدد سُكان البلده القديمه 5,000 نسمه.\n\nالتقسيم الاداري\nمناطق المدينه\nتعتبر البلده القديمه في بيت لحم اهم مناطقها على الاطلاق لوجود اهم المعالم الدينيه المسيحيه فيها، وهي تتوسط المدينه وشوارعها. من اهم تلك الشوارع: طريق الخليل، الشارع الجديد، شارع بيت ساحور، شارع بولس السادس، شارع السينما، شارع الفرير، شارع جمال عبد الناصر.\nالمخيمات\n\nتضم منطقه بيت لحم ثلاثه مخيمات رئيسيه هي مخيم عايده، مخيم بيت جبرين، ومخيم الدهيشه. ومثلها مثل باقي مخيمات الضفه الغربيه، فقد تاسست فوق قطعه من الارض استاجرتها الاونروا من الحكومه الاردنيه.\n\nمخيم عايده: تاسس عام 1950 بين مدينتي بيت لحم وبيت جالا. ويمتد فوق مساحه من الارض تبلغ 0,71 كيلومتر مربع لم تنم بشكل كاف مع نمو مجتمع اللاجئين. ولذلك، فان المخيم يعاني من مشاكل اكتظاظ شديده.\nمخيم بيت جبرين: تاسس عام 1950 في قلب مدينه بيت لحم. وهو يعد اصغر مخيم للاجئين في الضفه الغربيه حيث تبلغ مساحته 0.02 كيلومتر مربع فقط. وغالبا ما يطلق على المخيم ايضا اسم مخيم عزه.\nمخيم الدهيشه: تاسس عام 1949 فوق مساحه من الارض تبلغ 0.31 كيلومتر مربع ضمن حدود بلديه بيت لحم.\n\nالمناخ\nيسود في بيت لحم مناخ متوسطي معتدل، ذو صيف حار وجاف، وشتاء بارد ممطر. يحل فصل الربيع في اواخر شهر مارس (اذار) واوائل ابريل (نيسان)، ويعتبر شهرا يوليو (تموز) واغسطس (اب) احرّ شهور السنه، حيث يصل معدل درجات الحراره فيهما الى 28.9 ° مئويه (84 ° فهرنهايت)، اما اكثر الاشهر بروده فهو يناير (كانون الثاني)، ويصل فيه معدل درجه الحراره الى 3.9 ° مئويه (39 ° فهرنهايت).\nاما بالنسبه لمعدلات الامطار فتكون معدومه في بعض الاشهر مثل يونيو ويوليو واغسطس. بينما يتساقط بين شهريّ اكتوبر (تشرين الاول) وابريل (نيسان) عادهً، ويبلغ معدل المتساقطات السنوي 589 مليمتراً (23.2 انش)، وتكون في اعلى معدلاتها في شهري يناير وفبراير حيث يمكن ان يصل مستواها الى اكثر من 170 ميليمتر.\n\nالسكان\nوفقًا لسجلات الضرائب العثمانيه، شكل المسيحيون نسبه 60% من السكان في القرن السادس عشر، وفي منتصف القرن 16 اصبحت اعداد المسلمين والمسيحيين متساويه. لم يكن هناك مسلمون في نهايه القرن، وبلغ عدد سكانها 287 (سجل الذكور البالغين دافعي الضرائب). وطلب انذاك من المسيحيين وغير المسلمين دفع ضريبه الجزيه في جميع انحاء الدوله العثمانيه. في عام 1867، وصف زائر امريكي المدينه الذي بلغ عدد سكانها 3,000 الى 4,000 منهم 100 يتبعون البروتستانتيه و 300 من المسلمين و«ما تبقى ينتمون الى الكنائس اللاتينيه واليونانيه مع نسبه قليله من الارمن»  ووفقًا لتقرير اخر من نفس العام بلغ عدد السكان المسيحيين 3000، وبالاضافه الى 50 من المسلمين.\nفي عام 1948، شكلت المسيحيه نسبه 85% من التركيبه السُكانيه للمدينه معظمها من الطوائف اليونانيه الارثوذكسيه والكاثوليكيه، اما نسبه المسلمين بلغت 13% مسلم سني.\nوفقًا للاحصائيات الاسرائيليه عام 1967، بلغ عدد سكان بيت لحم 14,439 نسمه منهم 7,790 نسمه مسلمين ما نسبته 53,9% بينما بلغ عدد المسيحيين 6,231 نسمه ما يعادل 46,1% من سكان بيت لحم.\nوفقًا لتعداد الجهاز المركزي للاحصاء عام 1997، فقد بلغ عدد سكان المدينه 21,670 نسمه، بما في ذلك 6,570 لاجئ وهو ما يمثل 30.3% من سكان المدينه. وفي عام 1997، اما التوزيع العمري السكاني لفترات عُمريه مختلفه كالتالي: 27,4% تحت سن عشره سنوات و 20% 10-19 سنه و 17.3% 20-29 سنه، 17.7% 30-44 سنه و 12.1% 45-64 سنه و 5.3% فوق سن 65 عامًا. بلغ عدد الذكور 11,079 اما عدد الاناث 10,594.\nوفقا لتقديرات الجهاز المركزي للاحصاء، بلغ عدد سكان بيت لحم 29,930 نسمه في مُنتصف عام 2006. ومع ذلك، في تعداد 2007 كشف عن وجود 25,266 نسمه منهم 12,753 ذكورًا و 12,513 من الاناث. و 6,709 وحده سكنيه منها 5,211 كانت للاُسر. اما مُتوسط عدد افراد الاسر 4,8.\nبحلول عام 2005، كانت نسبه السكان المسيحيين تراجعت بشكل كبير، الى حوالي 40% من 50%. المسجد الوحيد في المدينه القديمه هو مسجد عمر، ويقع في ساحه كنيسه المهد.\n\nالدين\nيدعى الكثير من سكان بيت لحم المسيحيين انهم ينحدرون من العشائر المسيحيه العربيه التي قدمت من شبه الجزيره العربيه، اكبر هذه العشائر في المدينه: الفراحيه ونجاجره. العشائر السابقه الذكر قد تنحدرُ من الغساسنه الذين هاجروا من اليمن الى منطقه وادي موسى في الوقت الحاضر الاردن في حين ان النجاجره تنحدر من العرب في نجران في جنوب الحجاز. عشيره عريقه اخرى في المدينه هي عناتره وتنحدر اصولهم من شبه الجزيره العربيه.\n\nانخفضت اعداد المسيحيين في المدينه بشكل مُطرد، ويرجع ذلك في المقام الاول الى الهجره. انخفاض معدل مواليد المسيحيين يمثل ايضًا سببًا للانخفاض. في عام 1947، بلغت نسبه المسيحيين حوالي 85%، ولكن بحلول عام 1998 انخفضت النسبه الى 40%. في عام 2005، وضح رئيس بلديه بيت لحم فيكتور بطارسه ان \"نتيجه للتوتر سواء الجسدي او النفسي والحاله الاقتصاديه السيئه، كثير من الناس يهاجرون، سواء مسيحيين او مسلمين، لكن الهجره اكثر انتشارًا بين المسيحيين، لانهم بالفعل هم اقليه.\nادت اندلاع الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه الى انخفاض ناتج القطاع السياحي والتي اثرت على الاقليه المسيحيه وعلى اصحاب الفنادق في بيت لحم الذين يقدمون خدمات المُلبيه لاحتياجات السياج الاجانب. اشير تحليل احصائي لهجره المسيحيين من المدينه لانعدام الفرص الاقتصاديه والتعليميه، خصوصًا الطبقه الوسطى والمتعلمه منهم. مُنذ اندلاع الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه، غادر 10% من السكان المسيحيين المدينه.\nذكرت الصحيفه الاسرائيليه جيروزليم بوست ان «تقلص اعداد الطوائف المسيحيه الفلسطينيه في الاراضي المقدسه وبشكل خاص في بيت لحم جاء كنتيجه مباشره بسبب انتمائها الى الطبقه المتوسطه والعليا». يذكر ان المسيحيين لديهم صوره عامه كنخبه متعلمه وذات امتيازات طبقيه، وكذلك عدم لجوئهم الى العنف، مما يجعلهم اكثر عرضه للتعرض لاعمال عنف. يُذكر ان بسبب الهجره المسيحيه يتواجد غالبيه مسيحيين بيت لحم خارج العالم العربي بشكل خاص في امريكا اللاتينيه التي تضم نصف مليون فلسطيني في امريكا اللاتينيه والوسطى حيث ان 80 الى 85% منهم هم من المسيحيين الفلسطينيين. وتضم التشيلي اكبر جاليه فلسطينيه مسيحيه في العالم خارج منطقه فلسطين حيث يصل اعدادهم الى 350,000 وتعود اصول غالبيتهم الى بيت لحم وبيت جالا وبيت ساحور ويعتبرون من الاقليات الناجحه جدًا فغالبيتهم ينتمون الى الطبقه العليا والوسطى ومن المتعلمون كما وقد برز عدد منهم في السياسه والاقتصاد والثقافه.\nفي عام 2006، ووفقًا للاستطلاع الذي اجراهُ المركز الفلسطيني للبحوث والحوار الثقافي في المدينه ان 90% من المسيحيين قالوا ان لديهم اصدقاء مسلمين، ووافق 73,3% منهم على ان السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه تُعامل التراث المسيحي في المدينه باحترام ونسب 78% منهم سبب هجره المسيحيين الى القيود الاسرائيليه التي تفرُضها على السفر.\nان مدينه بيت لحم هي من اقدس المواقع المسيحيه في العالم كونها المدينه التي فيها وُلِدَ يسوع المسيح، وبسبب قدسيه مدينه بيت لحم لدى العالم المسيحي تتواجد في المدينه عدد كبير من الكنائس والاديره فضلًا عن المواقع المسيحيه المقدسه، بالاضافه الى المؤسسات المسيحيّه المختلفه من مدراس وجامعه كاثوليكيه ومستشفيات شتى، وكونها مدينه ميلاد يسوع تُحظى المدينه بشعبيه واسعه وترتبط بعيد الميلاد. كانت كنيسه المهد هي الاولى بين الكنائس الثلاث التي بناها الامبراطور قسطنطين في مطلع القرن الرابع الميلادي حين اصبحت المسيحيه ديانه الدوله الرسميه وكان ذلك استجابه لطلب الاسقف ماكاريوس في المجمع المسكوني الاول في نيقيه عام 325 للميلاد. دخلت كنيسه المهد سنه 2012 قائمه مواقع التراث العالمي، كنيسه المهد هي اول موقع فلسطيني يدرج ضمن لائحه التراث العالمي لمنظمه اليونيسكو. الجدول

في مدينه بيت لحم في اوائل الخمسينات حيث اُنتخب اول مجلس اداره لها بتاريخ 16 ابريل 1952. في 30 اغسطس 1965، تم انتخاب مجلس اداره جديد. ومع قرب البدء باحتفالات الالفيه الثانيه ودخول المحافظه في مرحله جديده من البناء والاعمار، اصدر معالي وزير الاقتصاد والتجاره قرارًا بتعيين مجلس الاداره الحالي الذي يضمُ نُخبه من رجال الاعمال والاقتصاديين لاداره شؤون الغرفه. وتندرج غرفه تجاره وصناعه محافظه بيت لحم

طرازان معماريان مختلفان: الطراز القديم السائد في البلده القديمه حيث القباب والجدران السميكه المبنيه من الحجر الكلسي والشبابيك والابواب على شكل اقواس، والمباني فيها ملتصقه ببعضها ومتراصه وشوارعها ضيقه ومقسمه الى حارات لكي يسهل الدفاع عنها. اما الطراز الثاني فهو الطراز الحديث السائد في مناطق السكن الجديده حيث البيوت الحديثه المستقله او العمارات المكونه من طبقات.\nويطوق المدينه الان مجموعه من المستوطنات التي يطلق عليها مجموعه (غوش عتسيون) ووصل عدد المستوطنات حولها عام 1985 الى 16 مستوطنه وتشكل مستوطنه افرات مركزها واكبرها، ويخطط لاقامه 9 مستوطنات حتى عام 2010.\nكونها المدينه التي شهدت

التصماميم المُميزه بقطب واشكال فنيه باستخدام الخيطان الحريريه بهيه الالوان، حيث حاول البعض المقاربه بين هذه التصاميم وتصاميم الزخارف والازياء الكنسيه، والزينه الرسميه والاوسمه للملابس العسكريه العثمانيه والبريطانيه القديمه.\n نحت عرق اللؤلؤ\nيعود فن نحت عرق اللؤلؤ في بيت لحم الى القرن الخامس عشر عندما اُدخل من قبل رهبان فرنسيسكان من ايطاليا. وازداد الطلب على هذه الاصناف بسبب زياده اعداد

      "summary": "بَيْت لَحم (بالسريانية: ܒܝܬ ܠܚܡ؛ باليونانية: Βηθλεὲμ؛ باللاتينية: Bethleem) هي مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة بيت لحم. تقع في الضفة الغربية التابعة للسلطة الفلسطينية على بعد 10 كم إلى الجنوب من القدس. يبلغ عدد سكانها 30,000 نسمة بدون سكان مخيمات اللاجئين. وتعتبر مركزاً للثقافة والسياحة في فلسطين.\nللمدينة أهمية عظيمة لدى المسيحيين لكونها مسقط رأس يسوع (عيسى). تضم بيت لحم العديد من الكنائس، ولعل أهمها كنيسة المهد، التي بنيت على يد قسطنطين الأكبر (330 م). وقد بنيت الكنيسة فوق كهف أو مغارة يعتقد أنها مذود البقر الذي ولد فيه يسوع. ويعتقد أن هذه الكنيسة هي أقدم الكنائس الموجودة في العالم. كما أن هناك سرداباً آخر قريب يعتقد أن جيروم قضى فيه ثلاثين عاماً من حياته يترجم الكتاب المقدس.\nبنيت المدينة وفقًا لعلماء الآثار على يد الكنعانيين في الألف الثاني قبل الميلاد، وعُرفت بعدد من الأسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسمها في مصادر قدماء السريان والآراميين. وقد مرَّ على المدينة عدد من الغزاة عبر التاريخ، حيث تعرّضت بيت لحم هي وبقية فلسطين للفتح الأشوري والبابلي والفارسي والإغريقي والروماني والبيزنطي. وأُعيد بناؤها من قبل الإمبراطور البيزنطي جستنيان الأول. وفتحها العرب المسلمون على يد عمر بن الخطاب عام 637م. وفي عام 1099م، احتلها الصليبيون الذين حصنوها واستبدلوا فيها الأرثوذكسية اليونانية برجال الدين اللاتين. وقد طُرد هؤلاء رجال الدين اللاتين بعد أن فتح المدينة صلاح الدين الأيوبي. ومع مجيء المماليك في عام 1250م، هُدمت جدران المدينة وأعيد بناؤها في وقت لاحق خلال حكم الإمبراطورية العثمانية. في عام 1917 انتزعت بريطانيا السيطرة على المدينة من العثمانيين خلال الحرب العالمية الأولى وكان من المفترض أن تُضمّن في المنطقة الدولية في إطار خطة الأمم المتحدة لتقسيم فلسطين عام 1947. وأُلحقت المدينة بالأردن بعد نكبة فلسطين عام 1948. وقد احتلتها إسرائيل في عام 1967 بحرب الأيام الستة. ومنذ عام 1995، ووفقاً لاتفاقية أوسلو، نُقلت السلطات المدنية والأمنية في المدينة إلى يد السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية.\nتقع بيت لحم ضمن سلسلة جبال القدس، وترتفع عن سطح البحر 775 متراً. وتعتبر المدينة تاريخياً منطقة مسيحية السكان، إلا أن معظم سكانها اليوم هم من المسلمين، ولكنها لا زالت موطناً لواحد من أكبر المجتمعات المسيحية الفلسطينية.\nلبيت لحم دور رئيس في القطاع الاقتصادي الفلسطيني من خلال السياحة التي تزداد أثناء موسم عيد الميلاد عندما يحتشد الحجاج المسيحيون إلى كنيسة المهد، حيث يوجد في بيت لحم أكثر من 30 فندقاً و 300 ورشة عمل للحرف اليدوية. ويسكن هذه المدينة أحد أقدم المجتمعات المسيحية في العالم على الرغم من تقلص حجمه بسبب الهجرة. اختيرت المدينة عاصمة الثقافة العربية للعام 2020. وسجّلت مدينة بيت لحم أول إصابات بفايروس كورونا التاجي «كوفيد-19» لتصبح أول مدينة تغلق في فلسطين لمدة زادت عن 70 يوماً.",
