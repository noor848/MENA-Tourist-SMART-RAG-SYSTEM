      "content": "Gaza City, often simply called Gaza, is a city in the Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Gaza Governorate. Located on the Mediterranean coast, 76.6 kilometres (47.6 mi) southwest of Jerusalem, it was home to Palestine's only port. With a population of 590,481 people as of 2017, Gaza City was the most populous city in Palestine until the Gaza war caused most of the population to be displaced.\nInhabited since at least the 15th century BC, Gaza City has been dominated by different peoples and empires throughout its history. The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years. Under the Roman Empire, Gaza City experienced relative peace and its Mediterranean port flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in the Palestine region to be conquered by the Rashidun army and quickly developed into a centre of Islamic law. However, by the time the Crusader states were established in 1099, Gaza City was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza City experienced several hardships—from Mongol raids to severe flooding and locust swarms, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza City and the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza City was established in 1893.\nGaza City fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine. As a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Its population rose sharply after the influx of Palestinian refugees displaced by the war and the ensuing Nakba. Gaza City was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, and in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly created Palestinian National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas, resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. The Gaza Strip was then subject to an Israeli-led, Egyptian-supported blockade. Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah Border Crossing in 2011 to pedestrians. The city has been largely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes since the Gaza war began in October 2023, including a large amount of significant cultural heritage in the Old City of Gaza.\nThe primary economic activities of Gaza City are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the blockade and recurring conflicts have put the economy under severe pressure. The majority of Gaza City's Palestinian inhabitants are Muslim, although there is also a Christian minority. Gaza City has a very young population, with roughly 75% under the age of 25. As of November 2025, many residents have fled or been evacuated to the Southern Gaza Strip, or killed as a result of Israel's actions in the north. Therefore, previous recorded or estimated population numbers have become outdated.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Gaza first appears in the military records of Thutmose III of New Kingdom of Egypt in the 15th century BC, and was mentioned in the Amarna correspondence as Āl Ḫazzati and other variant spellings. In Neo-Assyrian sources, reflecting the late Philistine period, it was known as Ḫāzat. It is clear that the name originates from none of these languages, however.\nBased on the city's Hebrew name, עַזָּה ʻAzzā, a common folk etymology insists the name stems from the Semitic root ע-ז-ז‎ ʻayin-zayin-zayin, from which words related to strength and fierceness are derived, but this is unlikely. The ע‎ in the root ע-ז-ז‎ corresponds to a Proto-Semitic *ʻ sound (compare Hebrew עַז ʻaz with Arabic عَزَّ ʻazza, both meaning \"to be strong, powerful, mighty\"), while it is clear from city's name in Arabic (غَزَّة, Ġazza), Koine Greek (Γάζα, Gáza), and Egyptian (gꜣḏꜣtw) that the name of Gaza was likely originally pronounced with an initial *ġ (/ʁ/) sound, and thus cannot have been from the same ע-ז-ז‎ root as עַז ʻaz.\nHistorically, Muslims often referred to the city as Ġazzat Hāšim in honor of Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, the great-grandfather of Muhammad who, according to Islamic tradition, is buried in the city.\n\nHistory\nGaza's history of habitation dates back 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world. Located on the Mediterranean coastal route between North Africa and the Levant, for most of its history it served as a key entrepôt of southern Palestine and an important stopover on the spice trade route traversing the Red Sea.\n\nEarly Bronze\nSettlement in the region of Gaza dates back to the ancient Egyptian fortress built in Canaanite territory at Tell es-Sakan, to the south of present-day Gaza. The site was inhabited until about 3000 BC. In about 2600 BC, the settlement was re-founded and this time inhabited by the Canaanites. Tell es-Sakan was abandoned again about 2300 BC.\n\nMiddle Bronze\nAnother urban center known as Tell el-Ajjul began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed.\n\nLate Bronze\nDuring the reign of Thutmose III (r. 1479–1425 BC), the city became a stop on the King's Highway, a crucial trade route of the Levant, and was mentioned in the 14th-century Amarna letters as Azzatu. Gaza later served as Egypt's administrative capital in Canaan. Gaza remained under Egyptian control for 350 years until it was conquered by the Philistines in the 12th century BC.\n\nIron Age\nIn the 12th century BC Gaza became part of the Philistine \"pentapolis\". Gaza achieved relative independence and prosperity under the Persian Empire.\n\nHellenistic period\nAlexander the Great besieged Gaza, the last city to resist his conquest on his path to Egypt, for five months before capturing it 332 BC; the inhabitants were either killed or taken captive. Alexander brought in local Bedouins to populate Gaza and organized the city into a polis (or \"city-state\").\n\nUnder the Seleucid Empire, Seleucus I Nicator or one of his successors renamed Gaza as Seleucia to control the surrounding area against the Ptolemies. Greek culture consequently took root and Gaza earned a reputation as a flourishing center of Hellenistic learning and philosophy. During the Third War of the Diadochi, Ptolemy I Soter defeated Demetrius I Poliorcetes in the Battle of Gaza in 312 BC. In 277 BC, following Ptolemy II's successful campaign against the Nabataeans, the Ptolemaic fortress of Gaza took control of the spice trade with Gerrha and South Arabia.\nGaza experienced another siege in 96 BC by the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus, who \"utterly overthrew\" the city, killing 500 senators who had fled into the temple of Apollo.\n\nRoman period\nJosephus notes that Gaza was resettled under the rule of Antipater, who cultivated friendly relations with Gazans, Ascalonites and neighboring cities after being appointed governor of Idumaea by Jannaeus.\nRebuilt after it was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 63 BC under the command of Pompey Magnus, Gaza then became a part of the Roman province of Judaea. It was targeted by Jewish forces during their rebellion against Roman rule in 66 and was partially destroyed. It nevertheless remained an important city, even more so after the destruction of Jerusalem during the First Jewish–Roman War. Following this, and again at the end of the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), captives were sold into slavery in Gaza.\nThroughout the Roman period, Gaza was a prosperous city and received grants and attention from several emperors. A 500-member senate governed Gaza, and a diverse variety of Greeks, Romans, Phoenicians, Jews, Egyptians, Persians, and Bedouin populated the city. Gaza's mint issued coins adorned with the busts of gods and emperors. During his visit in 130 AD, Emperor Hadrian personally inaugurated wrestling, boxing, and oratorical competitions in Gaza's new stadium. The city was adorned with many pagan temples; the main cult being that of Marnas. Other temples were dedicated to Zeus, Helios, Aphrodite, Apollo, Athena and the local Tyche. Christianity began to spread throughout Gaza in 250 AD, including in the port of Maiuma.\nFirst evidence of a Bishop of Gaza is from early 4th century, when St. Sylvan served in that capacity.\n\nByzantine period\nFollowing the division of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century, Gaza remained under the control of the Eastern Roman Empire, which in turn became the Byzantine Empire. The city prospered and was an important center for southern Palestine. A Christian bishopric was established at Gaza. Conversion to Christianity in Gaza was accelerated under Porphyry of Gaza between 396 and 420. In 402, Theodosius II ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed, and four years later Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas. It was during this era that the Christian philosopher Aeneas of Gaza called Gaza, his hometown, \"the Athens of Asia.\" The large Gaza synagogue existed in the 6th century, according to excavations.\n\nEarly Islamic period\nIn c. 638 Gaza was captured by Arab Muslim forces under Amr ibn al-As, in the years following the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine. It was captured by Amr's forces about three years later. Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great-grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf was buried, Gaza was not destroyed and its inhabitants were not attacked by Amr's army despite the city's stiff and lengthy resistance, though its Byzantine garrison was massacred.\nThe arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought significant changes to Gaza; at first, some of its churches were transformed into mosques, including the present Great Mosque of Gaza (the oldest in the city). It was later rebuilt by Sultan Baybars, who endowed it with a huge manuscript library containing over 20,000 manuscripts in the 13th century. A large segment of the population swiftly adopted Islam, and Arabic became the official language. In 767 Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; he founded the Shafi'i school, one of the four major schools of fiqh (law) in Sunni Islam. \nSecurity, which was well-maintained during the early Muslim rule, was a key factor in Gaza's prosperity. Although alcohol was banned in Islam, the Jewish and Christian communities were allowed to maintain viticulture, and grapes, a major cash crop of the city, were exported, primarily to Egypt.\nBecause it bordered the Negev, Gaza was vulnerable to warring nomadic groups. It was destroyed at the end of the Qays–Yaman war (793–796) between two powerful tribes of Arabia. However, by the 10th century, the city had been rebuilt by the Abbasid Caliphate; during Abbasid rule, the geographer al-Maqdisi described Gaza as \"a large town lying on the highroad to Egypt on the border of the desert.\" In 978, the Fatimid Caliphate established an agreement with Alptakin, the Turkic ruler of Damascus, whereby the Fatimids would control Gaza and the land south of it, including Egypt, while Alptakin controlled the region north of the city.\n\nCrusader and Ayyubid periods\nThe Crusaders conquered Gaza in 1100 and King Baldwin III built a castle in the city for the Knights Templar in 1149. He also had the Great Mosque converted back into a church, the Cathedral of Saint John. In 1154, Arab traveller al-Idrisi wrote that Gaza \"is today very populous and in the hands of the Crusaders.\" In 1187 the Ayyubids, led by Sultan Saladin, captured Gaza and in 1191 destroyed the city's fortifications. Richard the Lionheart apparently refortified the city in 1192, but the walls were dismantled again as a result of the Treaty of Ramla in 1193. Ayyubid rule ended in 1260, after the Mongols under Hulagu Khan completely destroyed Gaza, which became his southernmost conquest.\n\nMamluk period\nFollowing Gaza's destruction by the Mongols, Muslim slave-soldiers based in Egypt known as the Mamluks began to administer the area. In 1277, the Mamluks made Gaza the capital of a province that bore its name, Mamlakat Ghazzah (Governorship of Gaza). This district extended along the coastal plain of Palestine from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea, and to the east as far as the Samarian highlands and the Hebron Hills. Other major towns in the province included Qaqun, Ludd, and Ramla. Gaza, which entered a period of tranquility under the Mamluks, was used by them as an outpost in their offensives against the Crusaders which ended in 1290. In 1294 an earthquake devastated Gaza, and five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that had been restored by the Mamluks. Syrian geographer al-Dimashqi described Gaza in 1300 as a \"city so rich in trees it looks like a cloth of brocade spread out upon the land.\" Under the governorship of Emir Sanjar al-Jawli, Gaza was transformed into a flourishing city and much of the Mamluk-era architecture dates back to his reign between 1311 and 1320 and again in 1342. In 1348 the bubonic plague spread to the city, killing the majority of its inhabitants and in 1352, Gaza suffered from a destructive flood, which was rare in that arid part of Palestine. However, when Arab writer Ibn Battuta visited the city in 1355, he noted that it was \"large and populous, and has many mosques.\" The Mamluks contributed to Gazan architecture by building mosques, Islamic colleges, hospitals, caravansaries, and public baths.\n\nThe Mamluks allowed Jews to return to the city, after being expelled by the Crusaders, and the Jewish community prospered during Mamluk rule. Towards the end of the Mamluk period, the Jewish community in Gaza was the third largest in Palestine, after the communities in Safad and Jerusalem. In 1481, an Italian Jewish traveller, Meshulam of Volterra, wrote of Gaza:It is a fine and renowned place, and its fruits are very renowned and good. Bread and good wine is to be found there, but only Jews make wine. Gaza has a circumference of four miles and no walls. It is about six miles from the sea and situated in a valley and on a hill. It has a population as numerous as the sands of the sea, and there are about fifty (sixty) Jewish householders, artisans. They have a small but pretty Synagogue, and vineyards and fields and houses.\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1516 Gaza—at the time, a small town with an inactive port, ruined buildings and reduced trade—was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman army quickly and efficiently crushed a small-scale uprising, and the local population generally welcomed them as fellow Sunni Muslims. The city was then made the capital of the Gaza Sanjak, part of the larger Province of Damascus. The Ridwan family, named after governor Ridwan Pasha, was the first dynasty to govern Gaza and would continue to rule the city for over a century. Under Ahmad ibn Ridwan, the city became a cultural and religious center as a result of the partnership between the governor and prominent Islamic jurist Khayr al-Din al-Ramli, who was based in the nearby town of al-Ramla.\nAccording to Theodore E. Dowling, writing in 1913, a Samaritan community existed in Gaza in 1584. They possessed a large synagogue and two bathhouses. \"One of them still bears the name \"the Bath of the Samaritans.\" It is believed the Samaritans were expelled from the city before the turn of the 16th century.\nDuring the rule of Husayn Pasha, strife between the settled population and the nearby Bedouin tribes was dramatically reduced, allowing Gaza to peacefully prosper. The Ridwan period is described as a golden age for Gaza, a time when it served as the virtual \"capital of Palestine.\" The Great Mosque was restored, and six other mosques constructed, while Turkish baths and market stalls proliferated. After the death of Musa Pasha, Husayn's successor, Ottoman officials were appointed to govern in place of the Ridwans. The Ridwan period was Gaza's last golden age during Ottoman rule. After the family was removed from office, the city gradually declined.\nStarting in the early 19th century, Gaza was culturally dominated by neighboring Egypt; Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered Gaza in 1832. American scholar Edward Robinson visited the city in 1838, describing it as a \"thickly populated\" town larger than Jerusalem, with its Old City lying upon a hilltop, while its suburbs laid on the nearby plain. The city benefited from trade and commerce because of its strategic position on the caravan route between Egypt and northern Syria as well as from producing soap and cotton for trade with the government, local Arab tribes, and the Bedouin of Wadi Arabah and Ma'an. The bazaars of Gaza were well-supplied and were noted by Robinson as \"far better\" than those of Jerusalem. Robinson noted that virtually all of Gaza's vestiges of ancient history and antiquity had disappeared due to constant conflict and occupation. By the mid-19th century, Gaza's port was eclipsed by the ports of Jaffa and Haifa, but it retained its fishing fleet.\nThe bubonic plague struck Gaza again in 1839 and the city, lacking political and economic stability, went into a state of stagnation. In 1840 Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza. The Ottomans won control of the territory, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. However, the battles brought about more death and destruction in Gaza.\nDuring the late Ottoman period, British ships docking in Gaza were loaded with barley, which was primarily intended for marketing in Scotland for whisky production. Due to the absence of a British consular agent, precise data on the financial value and quantities of the goods are unavailable.\n\nStages of conflict and occupation\nWhile leading the Allied Forces during World War I, the British won control of the city during the Third Battle of Gaza in 1917. After the war, Gaza was included in Mandatory Palestine. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion. New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains. International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction.\nIn the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, Gaza was assigned to be part of an Arab state in Palestine but was occupied by Egypt following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Gaza's growing population was augmented by an influx of refugees from nearby cities, towns and villages that were captured by Israel. In 1957, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser made a number of reforms in Gaza, which included expanding educational opportunities and the civil services, providing housing, and establishing local security forces.\n\nIsraeli occupation and colonisation\nGaza was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War following the defeat of the Egyptian Army. Frequent conflicts have erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city since the 1970s. The tensions led to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza was a center of confrontation during this uprising, and economic conditions in the city worsened.\n\nPalestinian control\nIn September 1993, the leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords. The agreement called for Palestinian administration of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. The PNA, led by Yasser Arafat, chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.In 2005, Israel withdrew its troops from the Gaza Strip and removed the thousands of Israelis who had settled in the territory. (See Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004.) Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organisation Fatah. On 25 January 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Hamas, recognized as a terror organization by most western countries, has de facto control of the city and Strip.\nIn March 2008, a coalition of human rights groups charged that the Israeli blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade of the Gaza Strip. In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians were killed in the conflict.\n\nIn November 2012, after a week of conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant groups, a ceasefire brokered by Egypt was announced on 21 November. In the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed, according to UN OCHA. During the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, the 13-story Hanadi Tower, which contained a political office of Hamas, was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike.\n\nGaza War\nIn 2023, the city was again targeted during the Gaza war. On 2 November, the siege of Gaza City started. As of January 2024, Israel’s offensive has either damaged or destroyed 70–80% of all buildings in northern Gaza. Gaza was left largely deserted, with about only 300,000 people staying in the city. The remaining population was subjected to a humanitarian crisis and starvation brought on by the war.Seventy percent of the city was destroyed by airstrikes, and at least 64,964 people were killed in the Strip. Israel has been accused of committing a genocide of Palestinians in Gaza during the war, with South Africa initiating proceedings at the International Court of Justice against Israel. On 10 August 2025, five journalists were killed in Gaza city as a result of an Israeli air strike, including crew from Al-Jazeera Network.\n\nGeography\nCentral Gaza is situated on a low-lying and round hill with an elevation of 14 metres (46 ft) above sea level. Much of the modern city is built along the plain below the hill, especially to the north and east, forming Gaza's suburbs. The beach and the port of Gaza are located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) west of the city's nucleus and the space in between is entirely built up on low-lying hills.\nThe municipal jurisdiction of the city today constitutes about 45 square kilometres (17 sq mi). Gaza is 78 kilometres (48 mi) southwest of Jerusalem, 71 kilometres (44 mi) south of Tel Aviv, and 30 kilometres (19 mi) north of Rafah. Surrounding localities include Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun, and Jabalia to the north, and the village of Abu Middein, the refugee camp of Bureij, and the city of Deir al-Balah to the south.\nThe population of Gaza depends on groundwater as the only source for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears a small amount of water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. The Gaza Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer in the Gaza Strip and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most of the Gaza Strip, Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.\n\nA prominent hill southeast of Gaza, known as Tell al-Muntar, has an elevation of 270 feet (82 m) above sea level. For centuries it has been claimed as the place to which Samson brought the city gates of the Philistines. The hill is crowned by a Muslim shrine (maqam) dedicated to Ali al-Muntar. There are old Muslim graves around the surrounding trees, and the lintel of the doorway of the maqam has two medieval Arabic scriptures.\n\nOld City\nThe Old City forms the main part of Gaza's nucleus. It is roughly divided into two quarters; the northern Daraj Quarter (also known as the Muslim Quarter) and the southern Zaytun Quarter (which contained the Jewish and Christian quarters.) Most structures date from the Mamluk and Ottoman eras, and some were built on top of earlier structures. The ancient part of the Old City is about 1.6 square kilometres (0.62 sq mi).\nThere were seven historic gates to the Old City: Bab Asqalan (Gate of Ascalon), Bab al-Darum (Gate of Deir al-Balah), Bab al-Bahr (Gate of the Sea), Bab Marnas (Gate of Marnas), Bab al-Baladiyah (Gate of the Town), Bab al-Khalil (Gate of Hebron), and Bab al-Muntar (Gate of Tell al-Muntar).\nSome of the older buildings in Gaza's Old City use the ablaq style of decoration which features alternating layers of red and white masonry, prevalent in the Mamluk era. Daraj contains the Gold (Qissariya) Market as well as the Great Mosque of Gaza (oldest mosque in Gaza) and the Sayed al-Hashim Mosque. In Zaytun lies the Saint Porphryrius Church, the Katib al-Wilaya Mosque, and Hamam as-Sammara (\"the Samaritan's Bathhouse.\")\n\nDistricts\nGaza is composed of thirteen districts (hayy) outside of the Old City. The first extension of Gaza beyond its city center was the district of Shuja'iyya, built on a hill just east and southeast of the Old City during the Ayyubid period. In the northeast is the Mamluk-era district of Tuffah, which is roughly divided into eastern and western halves and was originally located within the Old City's walls.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, a new residential district, Rimal (currently divided into the districts of Northern Rimal and Southern Rimal), was constructed on the sand dunes west of the city center, and the district of Zeitoun was built along Gaza's southern and southwestern borders, while the Judeide (\"the New\") and Turukman neighborhoods of Shuja'iyya expanded into separate districts in the northeast and southeast, respectively. Judeide (also known Shuja'iyyat al-Akrad) was named after the Kurdish military units who settled there during the Mamluk era, while Turukman was named after the Turkmen military units who settled there.\n\nThe areas between Rimal and the Old City became the districts of Sabra and Daraj. In the northwest is the district of Nasser, built in the early 1950s and named in honor of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. The district of Sheikh Radwan, developed in the 1970s, is 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the north of the Old City and is named after Sheikh Radwan—the tomb of whom is located within the district. Gaza has absorbed the village of al-Qubbah near the border with Israel, as well as the Palestinian refugee camp of al-Shati along the coast, although the latter is not under the city's municipal jurisdiction. In the late 1990s, the PNA built the more affluent neighborhood of Tel al-Hawa along the southern edge of Rimal. Along the southern coast of the city is the neighborhood of Sheikh Ijlin.\n\nClimate\nGaza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh), with Mediterranean characteristics, featuring mild rainy winters and dry hot but humid summers. Spring arrives around March or April and the hottest month is August, with the average high being 31.7 °C (89.1 °F). The coolest month is January with temperatures usually peaking at 18.3 °C (64.9 °F). Rain is scarce and falls almost exclusively between November and March, with annual rainfall totalling approximately 395 millimetres or 15.6 inches.\n\nDemographics\nPopulation\nAccording to Ottoman tax records in 1557, Gaza had 2,477 male taxpayers. The statistics from 1596 show that Gaza's Muslim population consisted of 456 households, 115 bachelors, 59 religious persons, and 19 disabled persons. In addition to the Muslim figure, there were 141 jundiyan or \"soldiers\" in the Ottoman army. Of the Christians, there were 294 households and seven bachelors, while there were 73 Jewish households and eight Samaritan households. In total, an estimated 6,000 people lived in Gaza, making it the third largest city in Ottoman Palestine after Jerusalem and Safad.\nIn 1838, there were roughly 4,000 Muslim and 100 Christian tax payers, implying a population of about 15,000 or 16,000—making it larger than Jerusalem at the time. The total number of Christian families was 57. Before the outbreak of World War I, the population of Gaza had reached 42,000; however, the fierce battles between Allied Forces and the Ottomans and their German allies in 1917 in Gaza resulted in a massive population decrease. The following census, which was conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities shows a sharp decrease in population which stood at 17,480 residents (16,722 Muslims, 701 Christians, 54 Jews and three Metawilehs). The 1931 census lists 17,046 inhabitants (16,356 Muslims, 689 Christians, and one Jew) and another 4,597 in the suburbs (4,561 Muslims and 36 Christians).\nThe village statistics of 1938 list Gaza's population as 20,500 with 5,282 in nearby suburbs. The village statistics of 1945 list the population as 34,250 (33,160 Muslims, 1,010 Christians, and 80 Jews).\nAccording to a 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Gaza and the adjacent al-Shati camp had a population of 353,115, of which 50.9% were males and 49.1% females. Gaza had an overwhelmingly young population with more than half being 19 and under (60.8%). About 28.8% were between the ages of 20 and 44, 7.7% between 45 and 64, and 3.9% were over the age of 64.\n\nA massive influx of Palestinian refugees swelled Gaza's population after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. By 1967, the population had grown to about six times its 1948 size. In 1997, 51.8% of Gaza's inhabitants were refugees or their descendants. The city's population has continued to increase since that time to 590,481 in 2017, making it the largest city in the Palestinian territories. Gaza City has one of the highest overall growth rates in the world. Its population density is 9,982.69/km2 (26,424.76/sq mi) comparable to New York City (10,725.4/km2 – 27,778.7/sq mi), half of Paris density (21,000/km2 – 55,000/sq mi). In 2007 poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions were widespread and many residents received United Nations food aid.\n\nReligion\nThe population of Gaza is overwhelmingly composed of Muslims, who mostly follow Sunni Islam. During the Fatimid period, Shia Islam was dominant in Gaza, but after Saladin conquered the city in 1187, he promoted a strictly Sunni religious and educational policy, which at the time was instrumental in uniting his Arab and Turkish soldiers.\nGaza is home to a small Palestinian Christian minority of about 3,500 people. The majority live in the Zaytun Quarter of the Old City and belong to the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Baptist denominations. In 1906, there were about 750 Christians, of which 700 were Orthodox and 50 were Roman Catholic.\nGaza's Jewish community was roughly 3,000 years old, and in 1481 there were sixty Jewish households. At the time of the 1929 Palestine riots, there were fifty families living in Gaza, most of whom fled after the riots. In Sami Hadawi's land and population survey, Gaza had a population of 34,250, including 80 Jews in 1945. Most of them left the city after the 1948 War, due to mutual distrust between them and the Arab majority. Today, there are no Jews living in Gaza.\n\nEconomy\nThe major agricultural products are strawberries, citrus, dates, olives, flowers, and various vegetables. Pollution and high demand for water have reduced the productive capacity of farms in the Gaza Strip. Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets. Since the Oslo Accords, thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations. Minor industries include textiles and food processing. A variety of wares are sold in Gaza's street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, wicker furniture, and cotton clothing. The upscale Gaza Mall opened in July 2010.\nA report by human rights and development groups published in 2008 stated that Gaza had suffered a long term pattern of economic stagnation and dire development indicators, the severity which was increased exponentially by the Israeli and Egyptian blockades. The report cited a number of economic indicators to illustrate the point: In 2008, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended due to lack of access inputs for production and export problems. In 2009, unemployment in Gaza was close to 40%. The private sector which generates 53% of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt. In June 2005, 3,900 factories in Gaza employed 35,000 people, by December 2007, only 1,700 were still employed. The construction industry was paralyzed with tens of thousands of laborers out of work. The agriculture sector was hard hit, affecting nearly 40,000 workers dependent on cash crops.\nGaza's food prices rose during the blockade, with wheat flour going up 34%, rice up 21%, and baby powder up 30%. In 2007, households spent an average of 62% of their total income on food, compared to 37% in 2004. In less than a decade, the number of families depending on UNRWA food aid increased tenfold. In 2008, 80% of the population relied on humanitarian aid in 2008 compared to 63% in 2006. According to a report by OXFAM in 2009, Gaza suffered from a serious shortage of housing, educational facilities, health facilities and infrastructure, along with an inadequate sewage system that contributed to hygiene and public health problems.\nFollowing a significant easing of the closure policy in 2010, the economy of Gaza began to see a substantial recovery from anemic levels during the height of the blockade. The economy of Gaza grew by 8% in the first 11 months of 2010. Economic activity is largely supported by foreign aid donations. There are a number of hotels in Gaza, including the Palestine, Grand Palace, Adam, al-Amal, al-Quds, Cliff, al-Deira and Marna House. All, except the Palestine Hotel, are located along in the coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street. Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists, and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists, aid workers, and UN and Red Cross personnel. Upmarket hotels include the al-Quds and the al-Deira Hotel.\nPresence of hydrocarbon reserves around the region gives potential to Gaza, to develop as a leading industrial center. Many of the region’s gas and oil fields are underneath Gaza. In 1999, natural gas reserves were discovered, offshore of the territory, known as Gaza Marine. It holds 1 trillion cubic feet (28 billion cubic metres) of natural gas, as a part of the Levant Basin, which itself holds 122 trillion cubic feet (3.5 trillion cubic metres) of natural gas. The Levant Basin on the Mediterranean Sea, which includes coastal regions of Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, is estimated to have 1.7 billion barrels (270,000,000 m3) of oil. Gaza is the only coastal part of the State of Palestine. In 2000, exploration license were granted by the government to British Gas Group. However, the project was interrupted during the 2000–2005 uprisings, where supportive infrastructure, the seaport and airport was destroyed by Israel. In 2023, the work gain momentum again, until it was crashed in the ongoing war. A large number of people used to believe that, Gaza's oil and gas reserves is the reason for Israel's offensive on the territory, also described as a potential genocidal campaign.\n\nCulture\nCultural centers and museums\nThe Rashad Shawa Cultural Center, located in Rimal, was completed in 1988 and named after its founder, former mayor Rashad al-Shawa. A two-story building with a triangular plan, the cultural centers performs three main functions: a meeting place for large gatherings during annual festivals, a place to stage exhibitions, and a library. The French Cultural Center is a symbol of French partnership and cooperation in Gaza. It holds art exhibits, concerts, film screenings, and other activities. Whenever possible, French artists are invited to display their artwork, and more frequently, Palestinian artists from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are invited to participate in art competitions.\nEstablished in 1998, the Arts and Crafts Village is a children's cultural center with the objectives of promoting comprehensive, regular and periodic documentation of creative art. It interacted on a large scale with a class of artists from different nationalities and organized around 100 exhibitions for creative art, ceramics, graphics, carvings and others. Nearly 10,000 children from throughout the Gaza Strip have benefited from the Arts and Crafts Village.\nThe Gaza Theater, financed by contributions from Norway, opened in 2004. The theater does not receive much funding from the PNA, depending mostly on donations from foreign aid agencies. The A. M. Qattan Foundation, a Palestinian arts charity, runs several workshops in Gaza to develop young artistic talent and impart drama skills to teachers. The Gaza Theater Festival was inaugurated in 2005.\nThe Gaza Museum of Archaeology opened in the summer of 2008. The museum collection features thousands of items, including a statue of a full-breasted Aphrodite in a diaphanous gown, images of other ancient deities and oil lamps featuring menorahs.\n\nCuisine\nGaza's cuisine is characterized by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also played a role in many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas (\"chard and lentils\") and bisara (fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).\nSeafood is a key aspect of Gaza life and a local staple, Some well-known seafood dishes include zibdiyit gambari, literally, \"shrimps in a clay pot\", and shatta which are crabs stuffed with red hot chili pepper dip, then baked in the oven. Fish is either fried or grilled after being stuffed with cilantro, garlic, chillies and cumin, and marinated with various spices. It is also a key ingredient in sayyadiya, rice cooked with caramelized onions, a generous amount of whole garlic cloves, large chunks of well-marinated fried fish, and spices such as turmeric, cinnamon, and cumin. Many of the 1948-era refugees were fellahin (\"peasants\") who ate seasonal foods. Sumaghiyyeh, popular in Gaza not just on Ramadan but all year round, is a mixture of sumac, tahina and water combined with chard, chunks of beef and chickpeas. The dish is topped with crushed dill seeds, chillies and fried garlic and served in bowls. Maftool is a wheat-based dish flavored with dried sour plums that is served like couscous or shaped into little balls and steamed over stew or soup.\nMost Gaza restaurants are located in the Rimal district. Al-Andalus, which specializes in fish and seafood, is popular with tourists, as are al-Sammak and the upscale Roots Club. Atfaluna is a stylish restaurant near Gaza port run and staffed by deaf people with the goal of building a society that is more accepting of people with disabilities.\nThroughout the Old City there are street stalls that sell cooked beans, hummus, roasted sweet potatoes, falafel, and kebabs. Coffee houses (qahwa) serve Arabic coffee and tea. Gaza's well-known sweet shops, Saqqala and Arafat, sell common Arab sweet products and are located off Wehda Street. Alcohol is a rarity, found only in the United Nations Beach Club.\n\nCostumes and embroidery\nGauze is reputed to have originated in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal. Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric that had been made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.\nCirca 1990, Hamas and other Islamic movements sought to increase the use of the hijab (\"headscarf\") among Gazan women, especially urban and educated women, and the hijab styles since introduced have varied according to class and group identity.\n\nSports\nPalestine Stadium, the Palestinian national stadium, is located in Gaza and has a capacity for 10,000 people. Gaza has several local football teams that participate in the Gaza Strip League. They include Khidmat al-Shatia (al-Shati Camp), Ittihad al-Shuja'iyya (Shuja'iyya neighborhood), Gaza Sports Club, and al-Zeitoun (Zeitoun neighborhood).\n\nGovernance\nToday, Gaza serves as the administrative capital of the Gaza Governorate. It contains the currently defunct Palestinian Legislative Council building.\nThe first municipal council of Gaza was formed in 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa. Modern mayorship, however, began in 1906 with his son Said al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by the Ottoman authorities. Al-Shawa oversaw the construction of Gaza's first hospital, several new mosques and schools, the restoration of the Great Mosque, and the introduction of the modern plow to the city. In 1922, British colonial secretary Winston Churchill requested that Gaza develop its own constitution under Mandatory Palestine. However, it was rejected by the Palestinians.\nOn 24 July 1994, the PNA proclaimed Gaza the first city council in the Palestinian territories. The 2005 Palestinian municipal elections were not held in Gaza, nor in Khan Yunis or Rafah. Instead, Fatah party officials selected the smaller cities, towns, and villages to hold elections, assuming they would fare better in less urban areas. The rival Hamas party, however, won the majority of seats in seven of the ten municipalities selected for the first round with voter turnout being around 80%. 2007 saw violent clashes between the two parties that left over 100 dead, ultimately resulting in Hamas taking over the city.\nNormally, Palestinian municipalities with populations over 20,000 and that serve as administrative centers have municipal councils consisting of fifteen members, including the mayor. The current municipal council of Gaza, however, consists of fourteen members, including the installed by Hamas mayor, Nizar Hijazi.\n\nEducation\nAccording to the PCBS, in 1997, approximately over 90% of Gaza's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 140,848 were enrolled in schools (39.8% in elementary school, 33.8% in secondary school, and 26.4% in high school). About 11,134 people received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas.\nIn 2006, there were 210 schools in Gaza; 151 were run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 46 were run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and 13 were private schools. A total of 154,251 students were enrolled and 5,877 teachers were employed. The currently downtrodden economy has affected education in the Gaza Strip severely. In September 2007, a UNRWA survey in the Gaza Strip revealed that there was a nearly 80% failure rate in schools grades four to nine, with up to 90% failure rates in mathematics. In January 2008, the United Nations Children's Fund reported that schools in Gaza had been canceling classes that were high on energy consumption, such as information technology or science labs, and extra curricular activities.\n\nUniversities\nGaza has many universities. The four main universities in the city are al-Azhar University – Gaza, al-Quds Open University, al-Aqsa University and the Islamic University of Gaza. The Islamic University, consisting of ten facilities, was founded by a group of businessmen in 1978, making it the first University in Gaza. It had an enrollment of 20,639 students. Al-Azhar is generally secular and was founded in 1992. Al-Aqsa University was established in 1991. Al-Quds Open University established its Gaza Educational Region campus in 1992 in a rented building in the center of the city originally with 730 students. Because of the rapid increase of the number of students, it constructed the first university owned building in the Nasser District. In 2006–07, it had an enrollment of 3,778 students.\n\nPublic library\nThe Public Library of Gaza is located off Wehda Street and has a collection of nearly 10,000 books in Arabic, English and French. A total area of about 1,410 square metres (15,200 sq ft), the building consists of two floors and a basement. The library was opened in 1999 after cooperation dating from 1996 by Gaza under mayor Aoun Shawa, the municipality of Dunkirk, and the World Bank. The library's primary objectives are to provide sources of information that meets the needs of beneficiaries, provide necessary facilities for access to available information sources, and organizing various cultural programs such as, cultural events, seminars, lectures, film presentations, videos, art and book exhibitions.\nOn 27 November 2023, the Public Library was destroyed by Israeli airstrike.\n\nLandmarks\nLandmarks in Gaza include the Great Mosque in the Old City. Originally a pagan temple, it was consecrated a Greek Orthodox church by the Byzantines, then a mosque in the 8th century by the Arabs. The Crusaders transformed it into a church, but it was reestablished as a mosque soon after Gaza's reconquest by the Muslims. It is the oldest and largest in the Gaza Strip. In 2023, at the beginning of the Gaza war, it was destroyed by the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip, leaving most of the structure collapsed and the minaret partially destroyed.\n\nOther mosques in the Old City include the Mamluk-era Sayed al-Hashim Mosque that believed to house the tomb of the Islamic prophet Mohammed's great-grandfather, Hashim ibn Abd al-Manaf, in its dome. The building was damaged by an Israeli airstrike in October 2023, during the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip. There is also the nearby Kateb al-Welaya Mosque that dates back to 1334. In Shuja'iyya is the Ibn Uthman Mosque, which was built by Nablus native Ahmad ibn Uthman in 1402, and the Mahkamah Mosque built by Mamluk majordomo Birdibak al-Ashrafi in 1455. In Tuffah is the Ibn Marwan Mosque, which was built in 1324 and houses the tomb of Ali ibn Marwan, a holy man.\nThe Unknown Soldier's Square, located in Rimal, is a monument dedicated to an unknown Palestinian fighter who died in the 1948 War. In 1967, the monument was torn down by Israeli forces and remained a patch of sand, until a public garden was built there with funding from Norway.\n\nQasr al-Basha, originally a Mamluk-era villa that was used by Napoleon during his brief sojourn in Gaza, is located in the Old City and is today a girls' school. It was destroyed in the Israeli invasion of Gaza in 2024.\n\nThe Commonwealth Gaza War Cemetery, often referred to as the British War Cemetery, contains the graves of fallen Allied soldiers in World War I; it sits 1.5 km (1 mi) northeast of the city center, in the Tuffah district, near Salah al-Din Road. The cemetery has been damaged by Israeli army in the early stages of the Gaza war in 2023.\n\nThe Church of Saint Porphyrius, a Greek Orthodox church, oldest active church in the city and the third oldest church in the world. On 19 October 2023, part of the church was damaged during an Israeli airstrike, killing at least 18 civilians of the 450 Christian and Muslim Palestinian residents of the Gaza Strip that had been sheltering there.\n\nInfrastructure\nWater supply and sanitation\nAccording to the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 98.1% of Gaza's residents were connected to the public water supply while the remainder used a private system. About 87.6% were connected to a public sewage system and 11.8% used a cesspit. The blockade on Gaza severely restricted the city's water supply. The six main wells for drinking water did not function, and roughly 50% of the population had no water on a regular basis. The municipality claimed it was forced to pump water through \"salty wells\" because of the unavailability of electricity. About 20 million liters of raw sewage and 40 million liters of partially treated water per day flowed into the Mediterranean Sea, and untreated sewage bred insects and mice.\nAs a \"water-poor\" country, Gaza is highly dependent on water from Wadi Ghazza. The Gaza Aquifer is used as Gaza's main resource for obtaining quality water. However, the majority of water from Wadi Ghazza is transported to Jerusalem.\n\nPower grid\nIn 2002 Gaza began operating its own power plant which was built by Enron. However, the power plant was bombed and destroyed by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2006. Prior to the power plant's destruction Israel provided additional electricity to Gaza through the Israel Electric Corporation. The plant was partially rebuilt by December 2007, and Israeli electricity continues to be sold to Gaza.\n\nSolid waste management\nSolid waste management is one of key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, and the absence of law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management. One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.\nFor instance, the scale of damage resulting from Operation Protective Edge was unprecedented. All governorates in the Gaza Strip witnessed extensive aerial bombardment, naval shelling and artillery fire, resulting in a considerable amount of rubble. According to recent statistics, more than 2 million tonnes of debris was generated. Approximately 10,000 houses were leveled to the ground including two 13-story residential buildings. A tremendous amount of debris remains scattered in Gaza. Serious efforts and a high budget are required to handle this challenge. More importantly, and based on a UNEP study after the 2008 war, the debris is highly likely to be contaminated with PAHs and probably with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furan compounds. In January 2024, the Israeli army destroyed Gaza City’s main reservoirs, Al-Balad and Al-Rimal.\n\nHealth care\nAl-Shifa Hospital (\"the Cure\") was founded in the Rimal District by the British Mandate government in the 1940s. Housed in an army barracks, it originally provided quarantine and treatment for febrile diseases. When Egypt administered Gaza, this original department was relocated and al-Shifa became the city's central hospital. When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip after occupying it in the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser had al-Shifa hospital expanded and improved. He also ordered the establishment of a second hospital in the Nasser District with the same name. In 1957, the quarantine and febrile disease hospital was rebuilt and named Nasser Hospital. Today, al-Shifa remains Gaza's largest medical complex.\nThroughout the late 1950s, a new health administration, Bandar Gaza (\"Gaza Region\"), was established and headed by Haidar Abdel-Shafi. Bandar Gaza rented several rooms throughout the city to set up government clinics that provided essential curative care.\n\nThe Ahli Arab Hospital, founded in 1907 by the Church Missionary Society (CMS), was destroyed in World War I. It was rebuilt after the war by the CMS, and in 1955 became the Southern Baptist Hospital. In 1982, the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem took leadership and the original name was restored. Al-Quds Hospital, located in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood and managed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society, is the second largest hospital in Gaza.\nIn 2007, hospitals experienced power cuts lasting for 8–12 hours daily and diesel required for power generators was in short supply. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the proportion of patients given permits to exit Gaza for medical care decreased from 89.3% in January 2007 to 64.3% in December 2007.\nIn 2010, a team of doctors from Al-Durrah Hospital in Gaza spent a year of training at the cystic fibrosis clinic at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. Upon their return to Gaza, a cystic fibrosis center was established at Al-Durrah, although the most serious cases are referred to Hadassah.\nAl-Rantisi Hospital provides care for children.\n\nTransportation\nThe Rasheed Coastal Road runs along Gaza's coastline and connects it with the rest of Gaza Strip's coastline north and south. The main highway of the Gaza Strip, Salah al-Din Road (the modern Via Maris) runs through the middle of Gaza City, connecting it with Deir al-Balah, Khan Yunis, and Rafah in the south and Jabalia and Beit Hanoun in the north. The northern crossing of Salah ad-Din Street into Israel is the Erez Crossing and the crossing into Egypt is the Rafah Crossing.\nOmar Mukhtar Street is the main road in the city running north–south, branching off Salah ad-Din Street, stretching from the Rimal coastline and the Old City where it ends at the Gold Market. Prior to the Blockade of the Gaza Strip, there existed regular lines of collective taxis to Ramallah and Hebron in the West Bank. Except for private cars, Gaza City is served by taxis and buses.\nThe Yasser Arafat International Airport near Rafah opened in 1998 40 kilometres (25 mi) south of Gaza. Its runways and facilities were damaged by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2001 and 2002, rendering the airport unusable. In 2010, the tarmac ramp was destroyed by Palestinians seeking stones and recycled building materials. The Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel is located roughly 75 kilometres (47 mi) northeast of the city.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns and sister cities\nGaza is twinned with:\n\nSee also\nGaza genocide\nList of cities administered by the Palestinian Authority\nList of rulers of Gaza\nOutline of the State of Palestine\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nMunicipality of Gaza\nSpokesperson for Gaza Municipality\nGaza at Google Maps\nThe achievements of the municipal council for a period of 5 years (2008–2013) in Arabic Archived 19 August 2014 at the Wayback Machine",
      "summary": "Gaza City, often simply called Gaza, is a city in the Gaza Strip, Palestine, and the capital of the Gaza Governorate. Located on the Mediterranean coast, 76.6 kilometres (47.6 mi) southwest of Jerusalem, it was home to Palestine's only port. With a population of 590,481 people as of 2017, Gaza City was the most populous city in Palestine until the Gaza war caused most of the population to be displaced.\nInhabited since at least the 15th century BC, Gaza City has been dominated by different peoples and empires throughout its history. The Philistines made it a part of their pentapolis after the ancient Egyptians had ruled it for nearly 350 years. Under the Roman Empire, Gaza City experienced relative peace and its Mediterranean port flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in the Palestine region to be conquered by the Rashidun army and quickly developed into a centre of Islamic law. However, by the time the Crusader states were established in 1099, Gaza City was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza City experienced several hardships—from Mongol raids to severe flooding and locust swarms, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the Ridwan dynasty controlled Gaza City and the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza City was established in 1893.\nGaza City fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a part of Mandatory Palestine. As a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Its population rose sharply after the influx of Palestinian refugees displaced by the war and the ensuing Nakba. Gaza City was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, and in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly created Palestinian National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas, resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. The Gaza Strip was then subject to an Israeli-led, Egyptian-supported blockade. Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah Border Crossing in 2011 to pedestrians. The city has been largely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes since the Gaza war began in October 2023, including a large amount of significant cultural heritage in the Old City of Gaza.\nThe primary economic activities of Gaza City are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the blockade and recurring conflicts have put the economy under severe pressure. The majority of Gaza City's Palestinian inhabitants are Muslim, although there is also a Christian minority. Gaza City has a very young population, with roughly 75% under the age of 25. As of November 2025, many residents have fled or been evacuated to the Southern Gaza Strip, or killed as a result of Israel's actions in the north. Therefore, previous recorded or estimated population numbers have become outdated.",

      "content": "غَزَّه مدينه ساحليه فلسطينيه، واكبر مدن قطاع غزه وتقع في شماله، في الطرف الجنوبي للساحل الشرقي من البحر المتوسط. تبعد عن مدينه القدس مسافه 78 كم الى الجنوب الغربي، ويحدها من الشمال الشرقي اراضي مدينه الخليل الغربيه المحتله منذ عام 1948 وهي مركز محافظه غزه اداريًا واكبر مدن قطاع غزه، فمن حيث تعداد السكان بلغ عدد سكان المدينه 2,141,000 نسمه في عام 2023م، ما يجعلها اكبر تجمع للفلسطينيين في فلسطين. تبلغ مساحتها 56 كم2، مما يجعلها من اكثر المدن كثافه بالسكان في العالم.\nتعتبر مدينه غزه من اهم المدن الفلسطينيه؛ لاهميه موقعها الاستراتيجي والاهميه الاقتصاديه والعمرانيه للمدينه، بالاضافه الى كونها المقر المؤقت للسلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه، ووجود الكثير من مقراتها ووزارتها فيها.\nاسس المدينه الكنعانيون في القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، احتلها الكثير من الغزاه كالفراعنه والاغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والعثمانيين والانجليز وغيرهم. في عام 635م دخل المسلمون العرب المدينه واصبحت مركزاً اسلامياً مهماً. يوجد بها قبر هاشم بن عبد مناف الجد الثاني للنبي محمد بن عبد الله، لذلك تُسمى ايضاً غزه هاشم، كما انها مسقط راس الامام الشافعي الذي ولد عام 767م وهو احد ائمه المذاهب الاربعه عند المسلمين السنه.\nفي التاريخ المعاصر، سقطت غزه في ايدي القوات البريطانيه اثناء الحرب العالميه الاولى، واصبحت جزءاً من الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ونتيجه للحرب العربيه الاسرائيليه عام 1948م، تولت مصر اداره اراضي قطاع غزه واجرت عده تحسينات على المدينه. احتلت اسرائيل قطاع غزه عام 1967م (عام النكسه)، وبعد اتفاقيه اوسلو بين منظمه التحرير الفلسطينيه واسرائيل عام 1993م، بموجب اتفاق غزه-اريحا الموقَّع في 4 مايو عام 1994م انتقلت السلطه المدنيه الى سلطه الحكم الذاتي الفلسطيني. بعد انتخابات عام 2006م اندلع قتال بين حركه فتح وحركه المقاومه الاسلاميه حماس، حيث رفضت حركه فتح نقل السلطه في غزه الى حركه حماس، ومنذ ذلك الحين وقعت غزه تحت الحصار من قبل اسرائيل ومصر. بعد الثوره المصريه في 25 يناير 2011م، فتحت مصر معبر رفح من اجل التسهيل على مواطني غزه، مع ان هذا القرار لم يُشكِّل فارقاً كبيراً.\nالانشطه الاقتصاديه الرئيسيه في قطاع غزه هي الصناعات الصغيره والزراعه والعمل، ومع ذلك، فقد دُمِّر الاقتصاد من خلال الحصار الاسرائيلي والصراعات المتكرره.\n\nالتسميه\nتُعتبر غزه احد اقدم المدن التي عرفها التاريخ، اما سبب تسميتها بهذا الاسم فهو غير مُثبَّت بدقه، لان هذا الاسم كان قابلاً للتبديل والتحريف بتبدل الامم التي صارعتها، فهي عند الكنعانيين (هزاتي)، وعند الفراعنه (غزاتو او غذه) منذ القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، اما الاشوريون واليونانيون فكانوا يطلقون عليها (عزاتي) و(فازا)، وعند العبرانيين (عزه). اما العرب الجنوبيين (سبا، ومعين) فهي عندهم باللفظ العربي (غزه)، وهي في وصفهم ميناء مهم بالقرب من قرى اليهود، وذكرت لديهم منذ القرن الرابع قبل الميلاد فصاعدًا.\nفي العصور الوسطى، سماها الصليبيون (غادرز)، والاتراك لم يغيروا من اسمها العربي (غزه)، اما الانجليز ويطلقون عليها اسم (گازا) (بالانجليزيه: Gaza). وقد اختلف المؤرخون - كعادتهم بالنسبه لكثير من المدن القديمه – في سبب تسميتها بغزه، فهناك من يقول انها مشتقه من المَنَعَه والقوه، وهناك من يقول ان معناها: «الثروه»، واخرون يرون انها تعني: «المُميزه» او «المُختصه» بصفات هامه تميزها عن غيرها من المدن. اما ياقوت الحموي فيقول عنها في معجمه: «غَزَّ فلان بفلان واعتز به اذا اختصه من بين اصحابه».\nارتبط العرب بغزه ارتباطاً وثيقاً فقد كان تجارهم يَفِدون اليها في تجارتهم واسفارهم باعتبارها مركزاً مهماً لعدد من الطرق التجاريه، وكانت تمثل الهدف لاحدى الرحلتين الشهيرتين اللتين وردتا في القران الكريم في «سوره قريش»: «رحلتا الشتاء والصيف»: رحله القرشيين شتاءً الى اليمن، ورحلتهم صيفاً الى غزه ومشارف الشام. وفي احدى رحلات الصيف هذه، مات هاشم بن عبد مناف جدُّ الرسول المصطفى صلى الله عليه وسلم، ودُفن في غزه بالجامع المعروف حالياً بجامع السيد هاشم في حي «الدرج».\n\nالتاريخ\nاسس المدينه الكنعانيون في القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد. وطيله تاريخها، لم يكن لغزه حكم مستقل، حيث احتلها الكثير من الغزاه كالفراعنه والاغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والعثمانيين وغيرهم. وكانت اول مره تذكر فيها المدينه في مخطوطه للفرعون تحتمس الثالث (القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد)، وكذلك ورد اسمها في رسائل تل العمارنه. بعد 300 سنه من الاحتلال الفرعوني للمدينه نزلت قبيله من الفلستينيين وسكنت المدينه والمنطقه المجاوره لها، عام 635م دخل المسلمون العرب المدينه واصبحت مركزا اسلاميا مهما وخاصه انها مشهوره بوجود قبر الجد الثاني للنبي محمد، هاشم بن عبد مناف فيها ولذلك احيانا تسمى غزه هاشم. وتُعتبر المدينه مسقط راس الامام الشافعي 767م الذي هو احد الائمه الاربعه عند المسلمين السنه. سيطر الاوروبيون على المدينه في فتره الحملات الصليبيه، لكنها رجعت تحت حكم المسلمين بعد ان انتصر صلاح الدين الايوبي عليهم في معركه حطين عام 1187. ازدهرت المدينه في اخر ايام الحكم العثماني، حيث تاسس فيها اول مجلس بلدي عام 1893. سقطت غزه في ايدي القوات البريطانيه اثناء الحرب العالميه الاولى، واصبحت جزء من الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ونتيجه للحرب العربيه الاسرائيليه عام 1948، تولت مصر اداره اراضي قطاع غزه واجريت عده تحسينات في المدينه.\nاحتلت اسرائيل قطاع غزه عام 1967 (النكسه)، ولكن في عام 1993م، نُقلت المدينه الى السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه. بعد انتخابات عام 2006، اندلع قتال بين حركه فتح وحركه المقاومه الاسلاميه حماس، حيث رفضت حركه فتح نقل السلطه في غزه الى حركه حماس. ومنذ ذلك الحين وقعت غزه تحت الحصار من قبل اسرائيل ومصر. لكن بعد الثوره المصريه، قامت مصر بفتح معبر رفح من اجل التسهيل على مواطنين غزه، مع ان هذا القرار لم يُحدث فرقًا كبيرًا.\n\nالفتره القديمه\nيعود الاستيطان البشري في منطقه قطاع غزه الى تل السكن، وهو حصن مصري قديم، والذي بني في الاراضي الكنعانيه الى الجنوب من قطاع غزه في الوقت الحاضر. كما ان مركزًا اخر في المناطق الحضريه المعروفه باسم تل العجول بدا ينمو على طول وادي مجرى النهر في غزه.\nخلال العصر البرونزي الاوسط، اصبحت تل السكن اقصى مدن جنوب كنعان، وكانت وظيفتها بمثابه حصن. في عام 1650 قبل الميلاد، عندما احتل الهكسوس مصر، عُمرت مدينه ثانيه على انقاض تل السكن. ومع ذلك، هجرها في القرن 14 قبل الميلاد، في نهايه العصر البرونزي.\nاصبحت غزه في وقت لاحق عاصمه مصر الاداريه في ارض كنعان. في عهد تحتمس الثالث، اصبحت المدينه محطه على طريق القوافل بين مصر وسوريا، وجاءت في رسائل تل العمارنه باسم \"Azzati\".\nبقيت المدينه تحت السيطره المصريه لمده 350 عاما حتى غزاها الفلستينيون في القرن الثاني عشر قبل الميلاد، واصبحت جزءا من البنتابوليس \"pentapolis\" الخاص بهم. ووفقا لسفر القضاه، فان غزه كانت المكان الذي كان قد سجن فيه شمشون من قبل الفلستينيين حتى وفاته.\nبعد ان سيطر الاشوريون والمصريون على المدينه، حققت غزه الاستقلال النسبي والازدهار في ظل الامبراطوريه الفارسيه. ولقد حاصر الاسكندر الاكبر غزه، حيث بقت اخر مدينه تقاوم غزوه في طريقه الى مصر، لمده خمسه اشهر قبل احتلالها اخيرا سنه 332 قبل الميلاد، وكان سكانها اما قتلوا او تم سبيهم. احضر الاسكندر البدو المحليين ليسكنوا غزه، ونظم المدينه الى بوليس (او دوله-المدينه). وقد اكتسبت المدينه سمعه طيبه كمركز مزدهر للتعلم اليونانيه والفلسفه.\nشهدت غزه حصارا اخر في 96 قبل الميلاد من قبل الحشمونيين الذين «اطاحوا تماما» في المدينه، مما اسفر عن مقتل 500 من اعضاء مجلس الشيوخ الذين كانوا قد فروا الى معبد ابولو للسلامه.\n\nالعهد الروماني والبيزنطي\nاُعيد بناء المدينه بعد دمجها في الامبراطوريه الرومانيه في 63 قبل الميلاد تحت قياده بومبيوس الكبير، ثم اصبحت غزه بعد ذلك جزءا من احد مقاطعات الدوله الرومانيه في بلاد الشام. وكانت المدينه مستهدفه من قبل اليهود خلال تمردهم ضد الحكم الروماني في 66 وقد دمرت جزئيا. وظلت مع ذلك مدينه مهمه، خاصه بعد تدمير القدس. طوال العصر الروماني، كانت غزه مدينه مزدهره وتلقى المنح واهتمام عده اباطره. كان 500 عضو في مجلس الشيوخ يحكم غزه، وكان سكان المدينه مجموعه متنوعه من مختلف الاعراق، منهم الفلستينيين والاغريق والرومان والكنعانيين والفينيقيين واليهود والفراعنه والفرس، بالاضافه الى البدو. وكانت تصدر في غزه عملات معدنيه تزين مع تماثيل الالهه والاباطره. وخلال زيارته للمدينه في 130م، قام الامبراطور هادريان بافتتاح حلبه المصارعه شخصيا، في ملعب غزه الجديد، الذي اصبح معروفًا من الاسكندريه الى دمشق. وقد زينت المدينه في العديد من المعابد الوثنيه، وكان الاله الرئيسي \"مارناس\"، وهو احد الالهه القديمه التي انتشرت عبادتها في سوريا القديمه منذ النصف الثاني من الالف الثالث قبل الميلاد، وكان يطلق عليها داجون. وخُصصت المعابد الاخرى لزيوس، وهيليوس، وافروديت، وابولو، واثينا، وتيشي المحليه.\nبدات المسيحيه بالانتشار في جميع انحاء منطقه غزه في 250م، بما في ذلك في ميناء غزه.\nوتسارع اعتناق المسيحيه في منطقه غزه في فتره القديس بورفيريوس (بين عامي 396م و 420م). في سنه 402م، امر الامبراطور ثيودوسيوس الثاني بتدمير جميع معابد المدينه الوثنيه الثمانيه، وبعد اربع سنوات كلفت الامبراطوره ايليا ببناء كنيسه فوق انقاض معبد Marnas.\nوبعد انقسام الامبراطوريه الرومانيه في القرن 3 م، كانت غزه لا تزال تحت سيطره الامبراطوريه الرومانيه الشرقيه التي بدورها اصبحت الامبراطوريه البيزنطيه. ازدهرت المدينه، وكانت مركزا هاما لبلاد الشام.\n\nالحكم الاسلامي\nفي عام 635م حاصر المسلمون غزه وسيطر عليها جيش الخلفاء الراشدين تحت قياده عمرو بن العاص بعد معركه اجنادين بين الامبراطوريه البيزنطيه والخلافه الراشده في وسط فلسطين. وكان وصول العرب المسلمين قد جلب تغييرات جذريه على غزه، في البدايه حُولت بعض الكنائس الى مساجد، بما في ذلك المسجد الكبير الحالي في قطاع غزه (الاقدم في المدينه)، كما ان شريحه كبيره من السكان اعتنقت الاسلام، واصبحت اللغه العربيه هي اللغه الرسميه.\nوتعتبر المدينه مسقط راس الشافعي (767) الذي هو احد الائمه الاربعه عند المسلمين السنه. والذي عاش طفولته المبكره هناك. وكان الشافعي قد اسس فلسفه اسلاميه سنيه في الفقه، وسُمي المذهب الشافعي تكريما له. وعلى الرغم من حظر الكحول في الاسلام، سمح للجاليات اليهوديه والمسيحيه للحفاظ على انتاج النبيذ والعنب، وهو محصول نقدي رئيسي في المدينه، وكانت اساسا للتصدير الى مصر. لانه تحدها الصحراء، وكانت غزه عرضه لقتال جماعات البدو.\nفي عام 796م دُمرت غزه خلال حرب اهليه بين القبائل العربيه في المنطقه. ومع ذلك، تم اعاده بناء المدينه من قبل الخلافه العربيه الثالثه التي يحكمها العباسيون. وقد وصف الجغرافي العربي المقدسي غزه في 977م حين كان يحكمها الفاطميون «بانها بلده كبيره تقع على الطريق الرئيسي لمصر على الحدود مع الصحراء.» وقد كان في تلك الفتره اتفاق مع السلاجقه، تم بموجبه سيطره الفاطميين على غزه والاراضي الواقعه جنوبها، بما في ذلك مصر.\n\nالصليبيون والمماليك\nاحتل الصليبيون الاوروبيون المدينه من الفاطميين في عام 1100م، وقام الملك بلدوين الثالث ببناء القلعه التي استخدمها فرسان الهيكل في غزه في عام 1149. كما تحول الجامع الكبير الى كاتدرائيه القديس يوحنا. في عام 1154، كتب الرحاله العربي الادريسي عن غزه «المدينه اليوم كثيره السكان، وهي في ايدي الصليبيين».\nفي عام 1187م سيطرت القوات الايوبيه، بقياده صلاح الدين الايوبي على غزه، ثم دُمّرت تحصيناتها لاحقًا عام 1191م. وقد امر ريتشارد قلب الاسد بتدعيم المدينه مره اخري في 1192، لكن تم تفكيك الجدران مره اخرى نتيجه لمعاهده الرمله المتفق عليها في 1193. ولقد استمرت الفتره الايوبيه حتى 1260، بعد تدمير المدينه تماما على يد المغول تحت قياده هولاكو، حيث اصبحت غزه ابعد نقطه الى جنوب يتقدم اليها الجيش المغولي.\nبعد تدمير غزه على يد المغول، بدا الجنود المماليك باداره المنطقه في عام 1277م. وقد جعل المماليك غزه عاصمه المحافظه التي تحمل اسمها «حاكميه قطاع غزه». هذه منطقه تمتد على طول السهل الساحلي من مدينه رفح في الجنوب الى الشمال مباشره من قيساريه، والى الشرق. بقدر ما المرتفعات الغربيه وتلال الخليل المدن الرئيسيه الاخرى في المحافظه وشملت اللد والرمله. وقد استخدم غزه التي دخلت فتره من الهدوء خلال الفتره المملوكيه بها كموقع في هجماتهم ضد الصليبيين التي انتهت في 1290.\nفي عام 1294م، ضرب زلزال غزه فدمرها، وبعد مرور خمس سنوات، عاد المغول ليُدمروا كل ما اعاد المماليك بناءه. وقد وصف الجغرافي الدمشقي (الذي توفي عام 1327) غزه باعتبارها «مدينه كثيره الشجر، كسماط ممدود لجيش الاسلام في ابواب الرمل ولكل صادر ووارد الى الديار المصريه والشاميه.» وفي 1348م، انتشر الطاعون في المدينه، فقضى على معظم سكانها. كما عانى قطاع غزه من الفيضانات المدمره في عام 1352، والتي كانت نادره في ذلك الجزء القاحل من بلاد الشام الجنوبيه.\nالا ان الرحاله العربي والكاتب ابن بطوطه عندما زار المدينه في 1355، كتب عنها «انها كبيره ومزدحمه بالسكان، وفيها العديد من المساجد». وقد ساهم المماليك في الهندسه المعماريه في غزه ببناء المساجد والمدارس الاسلاميه، والمستشفيات، والحمامات العامه. كما سمحوا لليهود بالعوده الى المدينه، وقد شهد العصر المملوكي ازدهار المجتمع اليهودي في المدينه. في عام 1481م، كتب الرحاله مشولام «انها ارض جيده، ذات اشجار فاكهه وثمار والتي هي من نوعيه ممتازه، وهناك الخبز والخمر، والذي هو من صنع اليهود فقط، وفيها عدد كبير من السكان، هناك 70 عائله يهوديه 4 عائلات سامريه». في نهايه العصر المملوكي كانت الطائفه اليهوديه في غزه ثالث اكبر جاليه يهوديه في فلسطين، بعد صفد والقدس.\nوقد بنى المماليك واحدا من اهم المعالم في غزه، وهو قصر الباشا، الذي كان يُستخدم لحكم المدينه وادارتها. ويقع القصر في البلده القديمه وهو اليوم مدرسه للبنات، بالقرب من مقبره حرب الكومنولث، غالبًا ما يشار اليها بمقبره الحرب البريطانيه، والتي تحتوي على قبور جنود الحلفاء الذين سقطوا في الحرب العالميه الاولى وهي في حي التفاح.\n\nالعهد العثماني\nدخلت المدينه تحت حكم الخلافه العثمانيه الاسلاميه في القرن السادس عشر وبقيت تحت حكمهم حتى سنه 1917 عندما استولت عليها القوات البريطانيه خلال الحرب العالميه الاولى بعد ثلاثه معارك ضاريه راح ضحيتها الالاف من كلا الجانبين. وكانت غزه تتبع متصرفيه القدس العثمانيه، والتي كانت تتبع مباشره للباب العالي دون ان تتبع ايا من الولايات. وكانت المتصرفيه تضم بالاضافه الى قضاء غزه، كل من اقضيه يافا وبئر السبع والخليل. وقد حافظت متصرفيه القدس حتى اواخر العهد العثماني- باستثناء الفتره من 1906 حتى 1909 عندما ضم اليها قضاء الناصره- على حدودها.\nيذكر انه في الحرب العالميه الاولى عندما صمد لواء واحد من الجيش العثماني مؤلف من اقل من ثلاثه الف جندي فلسطيني في وجه فرقتين بريطانيتين امام غزه وكبدهم خسائر فادحه وارغمهما على التقهقر حتى العريش عام 1917 م، اصدر احمد جمال باشا القائد التركي الذي اشتهر بخصومته للعرب، بيانا رسميا اشاد فيه بالشجاعه الفذه التي ابداها اولئك الجنود الفلسطينيون في غزه امام اضعاف اضعافهم من جنود الاعداء، وانها بساله خارقه تذكر بالشجاعه التي ابداها اباؤهم من قبل عندما حموا هذه البقاع المقدسه بقياده صلاح الدين الايوبي.\n\nالعصر الحديث\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عام 1917، سقطت غزه بيد الجيش الانجليزي، ودخلت المدينه مع باقي مدن فلسطين مظله الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين عام 1920، واصبحت غزه مركزا لقضاء غزه في تلك الفتره حتى وقوع النكبه، اصبحت جزءا من فلسطين في فتره الانتداب البريطاني وتم اضافتها الى الدوله الفلسطينيه المقترحه عندما اصدرت الامم المتحده قرار تقسيم فلسطين الى دولتين عربيه ويهوديه عام 1947، ولكن قامت مصر بدخول المدينه عام 1948. في فبراير عام 1949 وقعت كل من مصر واسرائيل هدنه تقضي باحتفاظ مصر بالمدينه ولذلك كانت ماوى لكثير من اللاجئين الفلسطينيين عند خروجهم من ديارهم. وبقيت تحت الحكم المصري حتى حرب 1967.\nقرار التقسيم\n\nقامت هيئه الامم المتحده عام 1947 بمحاوله لايجاد حل الصراع العربي الاسرائيلي القائم على فلسطين، وقامت هيئه الامم بتشكيل لجنه UNSCOP المتالّفه من دول متعدّده باستثناء الدّول دائمه العضويه لضمان الحياد في عمليه ايجاد حلّ للنزاع.\nقامت اللجنه بطرح مشروعين لحل النزاع، تمثّل المشروع الاول باقامه دولتين مستقلّتين، وتُدار مدينه القدس من قِبل اداره دوليه. وتمثّل المشروع الثاني في تاسيس فيدراليه تضم كلا من الدولتين اليهوديه والعربيه. ومال معظم افراد لجنه UNSCOP تجاه المشروع الاول والرامي لتاسيس دولتين مستقلّتين باطار اقتصدي موحد. وقامت هيئه الامم بقبول مشروع لجنه UNSCOP الدّاعي للتقسيم مع اجراء بعض التعديلات على الحدود المشتركه بين الدولتين، العربيه واليهوديه، على ان يسري قرار التقسيم في نفس اليوم الذي تنسحب فيه قوات الانتداب البريطاني من فلسطين.\nاعطى قرار التقسيم 55% من ارض فلسطين للدوله اليهوديه، وشملت حصّه اليهود من ارض فلسطين على وسط الشريط البحري (من اسدود الى حيفا تقريبا، ما عدا مدينه يافا) واغلبيه مساحه صحراء النقب (ما عدا مدينه بئر السبع وشريط على الحدود المصريه). ولم تكن صحراء النّقب في ذاك الوقت صالحه للزراعه ولا للتطوير المدني، واستند مشروع تقسيم الارض الفلسطينيه على اماكن تواجد التّكتّلات اليهوديه بحيث تبقى تلك التكتّلات داخل حدود الدوله اليهوديه.\nوكانت غزه في ذلك الوقت مركزا لقضاء غزه، التي تم الحاقها بالدوله العربيه المُقترحه.\nحكومه عموم فلسطين\n\nهي حكومه تشكلت في غزه في 23 سبتمبر 1948  وذلك خلال حرب 1948 برئاسه احمد حلمي عبد الباقي.\nنشات فكرت تكوينها عندما اعلنت بريطانيا عن نيتها التخلي عن انتدابها على فلسطين واحالت قضيتها الى الامم المتحده. ادركت القياده الفلسطينيه عندئذ، ممثله انذاك بالهيئه العربيه العليا لفلسطين بزعامه الحاج امين الحسيني، اهميه التهيؤ لهذا الحدث واستباقه بايجاد اطار دستوري يملا الفراغ الذي سوف ينجم عن انتهاء الانتداب البريطاني وكان هذا الاطار هو اقامه حكومه عربيه فلسطينيه.\nكان قبل ذلك فولك برنادوت قد اعلن في تقرير له في 16 سبتمبر 1948 ان العرب لم يبدوا اي رغبه في تشكيل حكومه في القسم العربي من فلسطين مما قد يؤدي الى ضمه الى شرق الاردن. وقد قوبل اعلان هذه الحكومه بالرفض من عده انظمه عربيه هي الاردن والعراق ومصر. وظل تمثيلها شكليا لفلسطين في الجامعه العربيه لعده سنوات قبل انهيارها.\n\nالحكم المصري\nبعد حرب 1948، اُلحقت المدينه مع كامل قطاع غزه بمصر، حيث بقت تحت الحكم المصري حتى حرب 1967.\nفي فتره العدوان الثلاثي على مصر سنه 1956 قامت اسرائيل باحتلال المدينه والسيطره على شبه جزيره سيناء المصريه، لكن الضغط العالمي على اسرائيل اضطرها للانسحاب منها.\nحيث حدث في ربيع 1956 عدّه اصطدامات عسكريه بين مصر واسرائيل حدثت في قطاع غزه. اسرائيل اتّهمت مصر باستعمال المنطقه كقاعده للغارات الفدائيه على اسرائيل. في اكتوبر/تشرين الاول 1956، هاجمت اسرائيل منطقه قناه السويس في مصر بالتعاون مع فرنسا وبريطانيا، استولت القوّات الاسرائيليه على قطاع غزه وتقدّمت الى سيناء.\nفي مارس/اذار التالي، حلّت قوات طوارئ الامم المتحده محل القوات الاسرائيليه، ومصر استعادت السيطره على الاداره المدنيه للشريط. واعيد احتلال المدينه في حرب السته ايام (5 يونيو 1967 - 10 يونيو 1967).\n\nالنكسه\nسقطت المدينه في يد اسرائيل بعد عام 1967، لتظل تحت الاحتلال لمده 27 سنه وتعاني من الاهمال الاسرائيلي لها كباقي المدن العربيه الفلسطينيه المحتله. وقد صادرت سلطات الاحتلال مساحات شائعه من اراضي غزه واقامت عليها العديد من المستوطنات.\nكانت مساحه المستوطنات الاسرائيليه في قطاع غزه تبلغ 155 كيلومترا مربعاً تقريباً، وبالنسبه للكتله المحيطه بمدينه غزه، وهي الكتله الشماليه، فتتوزع المستوطنات التي تتصل باسرائيل عبر طرق عرضيه تضمن لها سهوله الاتصال، تضم:\n\nمستوطنه ايرتز: (انشئت عام 1968م) على الحدود الشماليه لقطاع غزه مباشره.\nمستوطنه ايلي سيناي: تقع على بعد 1 كم الى الشرق من شاطئ البحر ملاصقه تماما لحدود قطاع غزه الشماليه، وهي مستوطنه زراعيه انشئت عام 1983 لاستيعاب عددا من المستوطنين الذين تم اجلاؤهم من سيناء في اعقاب اتفاقيه السلام المصريه ـ الاسرائيليه.\nمستوطنه نيسانيت: (انشئت عام 1982م) على بعد 5 كم شرق البحر، وهي مستوطنه زراعيه، انشئت لتستوعب اعدادا من المستوطنين الذين تم اجلاؤهم من سيناء.\nمستوطنه نتساريم: انشئت عام 1972 م لتقسم قطاع غزه الى قسمين شمالي وجنوبي، فهي تقع على بعد 1 كم الى الشرق من شاطئ البحر، وعلى بعد 1 كم الى الغرب من الطريق الرئيس، وعلى بعد 4 كم جنوب غزه، ونظرا لاتساع مساحه هذه المستوطنه، وموقعها المتميز جنوبي مدينه غزه، والمشاكل الناجمه عن هذه المستوطنه، جعلت منها كتله استيطانيه قائمه بذاتها.\nفي ديسمبر 1987، انخرط سكان غزه مبكرًا في الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الاولى (انتفاضه الحجاره) وكانت القياده الوطنيه الموحده للانتفاضه، تقوم بتوزيع النشرات الاسبوعيه في شوارع غزه مع جدول زمني للاضراب المتصاحب مع الاحتجاجات اليوميه ضد الدوريات الاسرائيليه في المدينه. وفي المظاهرات، تم احراق الاطارات في الشوارع، كما القى الحشود الحجاره والزجاجات الحارقه على جنود الاحتلال. ورد الجيش الاسرائيلي بالغاز المسيل للدموع والرصاص المطاطي. واغلقت المدارس في مدينه غزه قسرا، وفتحت تدريجيا لبضع ساعات. ونفذت الاعتقالات خارج البيوت، وفرض حظر التجول ومنع السفر، ما اعتبره الفلسطينيون بانه عقاب جماعي. ردا على اغلاق المدارس، وتنظيم دورات تعليم سكان المنزل لمساعده الطلاب على استدراك الماده الفائته، وهذا اصبح واحدا من الرموز القليله من العصيان المدني.\nيشار بالذكر الى ان قوات الاحتلال الاسرائيليه قد انسحبت من قطاع غزه في 15 اب / اغسطس 2005 وذلك بقرار من رئيس الوزراء الاسرائيلي اريئيل شارون بعد انشاءها منذ 38 عاما، تم بعدها تفكيك 21 مستوطنه بقطاع غزه و4 مستوطنات بالضفه الغربيه.\n\nالسلطه الفلسطينيه\nبقيت المدينه تحت الاحتلال الاسرائيلي حتى عام 1994، حيث انه في سبتمبر 1993، بعد مُفاوضات سريه، وقّع كل من رئيس وزراء اسرائيل اسحاق رابين ورئيس منظمه التحرير الفلسطينيه ياسر عرفات اتفاقيه اعلان مبادئ التي تقر انسحاب اسرائيل من قطاع غزه ومناطق اخرى، وتحويل اداره الحكومه المحليه للفلسطينيين، وفي مايو 1994، انسحبت القوات الاسرائيليه من المدينه ومن القطاع بشكل جزئي تاركه عده مستوطنات لها تحت امره الجيش الاسرائيلي في عمق القطاع، وتولت بموجب اتفاقيه اوسلو السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه اداره المدينه بعد ان كانت تتخذها قوات الجيش الاسرائيلي مقرًا لها اثناء احتلال قطاع غزه ما بين 1967 و1994، واصبحت منطقه قطاع غزه جُزئيًا تحت حكم السلطه الفلسطينيه، الا ان قطاع غزه ظل فعليًا تحت الاحتلال الاسرائيلي الى ان انسحبت اسرائيل بالكامل من اراضي قطاع غزه في 15 اغسطس 2005 باوامر من رئيس الوزراء الاسرائيلي وقتها اريئيل شارون وابقت على حصارها برًا وبحرًا وجوًا.\nبعد فوز حركه حماس بعدد كبير من مقاعد البرلمان الفلسطيني في الانتخابات اندلعت العديد من المناوشات المتفرقه بين عناصر من حركتي فتح وحماس ووصل الامر ذروته في منتصف يونيو من عام 2007 حيث قامت حركه حماس بالسيطره على كامل قطاع غزه والمؤسسات الامنيه والحكوميه فيه.\n\nوفي نهايه عام 2008 وبدايه عام 2009 وتحديدا بدءا من 27 ديسمبر 2008، بدات اسرائيل حرب عدوانيه شرسه على قطاع غزه بدات بالقصف الجوي العنيف لجميع مقرات الشرطه الفلسطينيه ثم تتالى القصف لمده اسبوع للمنازل والمساجد وحتى المستشفيات وبعد اسبوع بدات بالزحف البري الى الاماكن المفتوحه في حمله عسكريه عدوانيه غاشمه كان هدفها حسب ما اعلن قاده الاحتلال الصهيوني هو انهاء حكم حركه المقاومه الاسلاميه حماس، والقضاء على المقاومه الفلسطينيه لا سيما اطلاق الصواريخ محليه الصنع مثل صاروخ القسام او صواريخ روسيه او صينيه مثل صاروخ غراد التي وصل مداها خلال الحرب الى 50 كم، واستُخدمت القوات الصهيونيه الاسلحه والقذائف المحرمه دوليًا مثل القنابل الفسفوريه المسرطنه والقنابل اجله التفجير وغيرها.\nحاصرت القوات الاسرائيليه قطاع غزه، وقطعت عنها الكهرباء والوقود، وحرمت المرضى من الادويه، ومنعت الدول العربيه المُجاوره من ادخال الوقود الى القطاع، وما زال الحصار مفروضًا على القطاع حتى الان، وقد قتل كثير من الفلسطينيين من جراء الاشتباكات والتوغلات الاسرائيليه في القطاع، لا سيما حين قصفت مخيم جباليا شمالي قطاع غزه بالصواريخ وتوغلت فيه.\nنزح كثير من الفلسطينيين الى معبر رفح املين ان يدخلوا الى الاراضي المصريه ليبحثوا عن السلام، لكن الاداره المصريه منعت النازحين من الدخول الى الاراضي المصريه، وقد كسر النازحون معبر رفح في شهر مارس ودخلوا الى الاراضي المصريه وما زالوا يعانون من اثار الحصار الى الان.\nوتحاول منظمات انسانيه دوليه كسر الحصار المفروض على غزه من خلال ارسال سفن بها عدد من النشطاء، محمله بالمساعدات الانسانيه، الا ان اسرائيل تمنع وصول تلك السفن، ومن تلك المحاولات اسطول الحريه عام 2010،  وما تعرض له من هجوم عسكري اسرائيلي.\n\nفي نوفمبر 2012، اقدمت اسرائيل على الهجوم على غزه بقصف عشوائي استهدف في بادئ الامر احد قاده حماس، الاّ انه طال المدنيين بشكل رئيسي، ونتج عنه العشرات من الضحايا. وقد ردّت المقاومه الفلسطينيه بشكل غير مسبوق عبر قصفها لمدن في العمق الاسرائيلي كتل ابيب، وهرتسيليا وبئر السبع بعشرات الصواريخ.\nفي صيف 2014، شنت اسرائيل حربًا اخرى على غزه، فبدءا من يوم 8 يوليو 2014 بدا الجيش الاسرائيلي عمليه الجرف الصامد وردت كتائب عز الدين القسام بمعركه العصف الماكول  وردت حركه الجهاد الاسلامي بعمليه البنيان المرصوص وذلك بعد موجه عنف تفجرت مع خطف وتعذيب وحرق الطفل محمد ابو خضير من شعفاط على ايدي مجموعه مستوطنين في 2 يوليو 2014،، واعاده اعتقال العشرات من محرري صفقه شاليط، واعقبها احتجاجات واسعه في القدس وداخل عرب 48 وكذلك مناطق الضفه الغربيه، واشتدت وتيرتها بعد ان دهس اسرائيلي اثنين من العمال العرب قرب حيفا، وتخلل التصعيد قصف متبادل بين اسرائيل والمقاومه الفلسطينيه في قطاع غزه. تخلل هذه الحرب عده عمليات عسكريه مثل عمليه ناحل عوز وعمليه العاشر من رمضان.\n\nالجغرافيا\nيقع وسط غزه على تله بارتفاع 45 قدما (14 متر) فوق مستوى البحر. بُنيت جزء كبير من المدينه الحديثه على طول السهل اسفل التل، وخصوصا في الشمال والشرق، وتشكّل ضواحي غزه. يقع كل من شاطئ وميناء غزه على بعد 3 كم (1,9 ميل) عن مركز مدينه غزه. تبعد مدينه غزه 78 كيلومترًا (48 ميل) الى الجنوب الغربي من القدس، و 71 كيلومترًا (44 ميل) جنوب تل ابيب،  وعلى بعد 30 كيلومترًا (19 ميل) شمال مدينه رفح. مواقع محيطه تشمل بيت لاهيا وبيت حانون، وجباليا الى الشمال، وقريه ابو مدين، ومخيم البريج ومخيم النصيرات ومدينه دير البلح الى الجنوب.\nتبلغ مساحه الاراضي التابعه للبلديه ما يُقارب 45 كم مربع (17 ميل مربع). في الانتداب البريطاني، شكلت المناطق الحضريه (المبنيه) ما يقارب 7,960 كيلو متر مربع (3070 ميل مربع) اما المناطق الريفيه شكلت 143,063 كيلو متر مربع (55,237 ميل مربع). بلغت مساحه الاراضي المرويه 24,040 كم مربع (9,280 ميل مربع) والاراضي المزروعه بالحبوب حيث بلغت مساحتها 117,899 كم مربع (45,521 ميل مربع).\n\nيعتمد سكان غزه على المياه الجوفيه كمصدر وحيد للشرب والاستخدام الزراعي والمنزلي. يعد وادي غزه اقرب جدول مائي جنوبا. والذي يحتوي على كميه قليله من الماء في الشتاء اما صيفا فيكاد لا يحتوي على ماء. يتم تحويل معظم امدادات المياه فيها الى اسرائيل. المياه الجوفيه على طول ساحل قطاع غزه هو الخزان الرئيسي للماء في قطاع غزه وتتكون معظمها من الحجر الرملي العصر الجليدي. مثل معظم قطاع غزه، مغطى غزه بتراب رباعي.\nالمعادن الطينيه في التربه تمتص الكثير من المواد الكيميائيه العضويه وغير العضويه والتي قد خففت جزئيًا مدى تلوث المياه الجوفيه. تله معروفه في جنوب شرق غزه تسمى (المنطار) وهو ذات ارتفاع 270 قدم (82 م) فوق مستوى سطح البحر.\n\nمناطق المدينه\nتشكل البلده القديمه جزء رئيسي من نواه غزه. وتتكون من حي الدرج في الشمال (المعروف ايضًا باسم الحي مسلم) وحي الزيتون في الجنوب. تعود مُعظم المباني الى العصر المملوكي او العصر العثماني وبُنيت على بعض المباني القديمه. وتبلغ مساحه البلده القديمه حوالي 1,6 كيلومتر مربع (0.62 ميل مربع). تتكون غزه من 11 حي، يقع حي الدرج وحي الصبره ما بين حي الرمال والبلده القديمه.\n\nحي الشجاعيه: من اكبر احياء مدينه غزه، وينقسم الى قسمين الشجاعيه الجنوبيه (التركمان) والشجاعيه الشماليه (الجديده)، بُنى خلال عهد الايوبيين، يسكنه اكثر من 300 الف نسمه، ويعمل معظم سكانه بصناعات خفيفه مثل الخياطه والزراعه وغيرها كما انه يمتاز بانه منطقه تجاريه فيها كل الاشكال التجاريه والورش، به مقبرتان القديمه، ومقبره الشهداء، وبه اكبر منطقه صناعيه في غزه، وبه معبر المنطار التجاري. وقد شهد هذا الحي العديد من الاجتياحات الاسرائيليه.\nحي التفاح: تعود هذه التسميه لكثره اشجار التفاح التي كانت تنتشر في هذا الحي وهو من الاحياء القديمه بمدينه غزه.\nحي الرمال: ويعتبر من ارقى احياء مدينه غزه واكبرها مساحه بُني في ثلاثينيات واربعينيات القرن 20، وينقسم الي الرمال الشمالي والجنوبي. ويمتد الشمالي منه من بدايه حي الشيخ رضوان (الشارع الاول) الى شارع المختار والرمال الجنوبي من شارع عمر المختار الى بدايه حي تل الهوى.\nحي النصر: سُمي الحي بالنصر احترامًا للجمال عبد الناصر الذي بُني في خمسينيات القرن 20.\nحي الزيتون: سمي بذلك لكثره اشجار الزيتون المزروعه فيه، ولكن تم اقتلاع وتجريف الكثير منها خلال انتفاضه الاقصى وبخاصه في الحرب الاخيره من قبل الجيش الاسرائيلي على قطاع غزه بتاريخ 27/12/2008 م، ويعتبر حي الزيتون احد اكبر احياء مدينه غزه، حيث يقطنه اكثر من 100 الف نسمه.\nحي الدرج: وكان يسمى سابقاً «حي بني عامر» نسبه لقبيله بني عامر العربيه التي سكنته مع بدايه الفتح الاسلامي ثم حي«البرجليه» نسبه للمحاربين المدافعين عن ابراج المدينه في العصر المملوكي.\nحي الصبره: من احياء غزه القديمه نسبيًا ويقع بعد شارع الثلاثيني.\nحي الشيخ رضوان: يمتد من الشارع الاول الى الشارع الثالث شمالاً ومن شارع النصر غرباً ومن قريه جباليا النزله شرقاً ويقع الحي على بعد 3 كيلومتر (1.9 ميل) شمال البلده القديمه.\nحي تل الهوى: وهو احد الاحياء الجديده وبرزت فيه العماره بعد قدوم السلطه الفلسطينيه الى غزه حيث اقيمت اغلب المؤسسات الحكوميه في هذا الحي، وعند قدوم حكومه حركه المقاومه الاسلاميه حماس عن طريق الانتخابات قامت بتسميته بتل الاسلام، لكن لم تنجح في ذلك، وبقي الناس ينادوه بتل الهوى.\nحي الشيخ عجلين: هو حي يقع في جنوب مدينه غزه بالقرب من الطريق الساحلي. في 18 نوفمبر 2002، هاجمت قوات الدفاع الاسرائيليه الحي، ودمّرت مكاتب جهاز الامن الوقائي التابع للسلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه.\nحي الدرج\nالمخيمات\n\nمخيم جباليا: يقع شمال مدينه غزه ويعتبر اكبر المخيمات ولكنه يتبع لمحافظه شمال غزه وليس لمحافظه غزه.\nمخيم الشاطئ: يقع غرب المدينه مقابلاً للساحل.\nمخيم النصيرات: يقع على بعد 8 كم جنوب مدينه غزه وعلى بعد 6 كم شمال بلده دير البلح ويقع المخيم في وسط قطاع غزه\n\nالمناخ\nتمتاز غزه بمناخ متوسطي وشتاء معتدل جاف، والصيف حار ساخن. يبدا فصل الربيع في شهر مارس ابريل واكثر الشهور حراره يوليو واغسطس. اما متوسط ارتفاع درجات الحراره يبلغ 33 سلسيوس (91 درجه فهرنهايت). ويعد شهر يناير ابرد شهور السنه متوسط الدرجات الحراره المنخفضه يبلغ 7 سلسيوس (45 درجه فهرنهايت). الامطار شحيحه وتهطل بين شهري نوفمبر ومارس، ويبلغ

هي في شهر يناير بنحو 7.6 عقده/ساعه، وقد ترجع هذه السرعه الى مرور المنخفضات الجويه التي عاده ما تصاحبها رياح شديده. تبلغ سرعه الرياح ادنى معدلاتها في فصل الصيف، فيبلغ المتوسط الفصلي حوالي 5 عقده/ساعه، وينخفض متوسط سرعه الرياح في فصل الربيع عما هو في فصل الشتاء ليبلغ 6.7 عقده/ساعه، وتقل سرعه الرياح في الخريف عن فصل الشتاء والربيع بينما تزيد عن فصل الصيف اذ تبلغ 5.6 عقده/ساعه.\n\nالسكان\nوفقا للاحصاءات العثمانيه في عام 1557، كان عدد الذكور 2477. حسب الاحصائيات عام 1596 اظهرت ان عدد المسلمين كان كالتالي (456 اسره، 115 عزاب، 59 شخص ديني و19 شخص من ذو الاحتياجات الخاصه). اضف الى اعداد المسلمين، كان عدد الجنود العثمانيون 119 جندي. اما المسيحين كان عدد الاسر 294 اسره و7 اشخاص عزاب، بينما كان عدد الاسر اليهوديه ما يقارب 73 اسره و8 اسر من السامريون. في المجموع، بلغ عدد سكان غزه 6,000 نسمه وكانت في المركز الثالث كبراً من حيث عدد السكان في فلسطين العثمانيه بعد القدس وصفد.\nفي عام 1838، كان عدد المسلمين 4,000 نسمه و 100 من المسيحيين (دافعين للضرائب مقابل حمايتهم) وبالتالي بلغ عدد السكان النهائي 15,000 او 16,000 نسمه واصبحت اكبر من القدس من حيث عدد السكان في ذلك الوقت. العدد الكامل للاسر المسيحيه بلغ 57 اسره. قبل الحرب العالميه الاولى بلغ عدد سكان غزه حوالي 42,000 نسمه، وادى القتال ما بين القوات العثمانيه والالمانيه وقوات التحالف الى انخفاض اعداد سكان غزه.\nحسب الاحصائيات عام 1997، من قبل الجهاز المركزي للاحصاء الفلسطيني بلغ عدد سكان غزه مع مخيم الشاطئ 353,115 منهم 50,9% ذكور و49,1% اناث. تمتاز غزه بكثره الشباب بنسبه 60,8% وتتراوح اعمارهم ما بين (0-19 سنه). 28,8% من السكان تتراوح اعمارهم (20-44 سنه)، 7,7% ما بين (45-64 سنه)، وبلغت نسبه الذين تجاوزت اعمارهم 64 عام 3,9%.\nبلغ عدد سكان غزه 590,400 نسمه. سكان مدينه غزه وفلسطين عامه ينحدرون من اصول ساميه، وكجميع سكان البحر الابيض المتوسط لهم ملامح عربيه سمراء ومتنوعه لا تخلو من تاثيرات متوسطيه.\nفي سنتي 2023 و2024 مارست قوت الاحتلال الاسرائيلي قصفا مباشرا على السكان المدنيين حيث قتلت ما يزيد عن 40 الف فلسطيني جلهم نساء واطفال من سكان غزه\n\nالدين\nينتمي معظم سكان غزه الى الدين الاسلامي السني. عندما كانت غزه تتبع الدوله الفاطميه، كان الشيعه مسيطرين على غزه، ولكن بعدما استرجعها القائد صلاح الدين الايوبي رقي بالنهج السني بصرامه دينيه وتعليميه، مما كان له دور في توحيد جنوده العربي والترك.\nتوجد اقليه صغيره من المسيحيين الفلسطينيين حوالي 3,500 نسمه تعيش في المدينه. وغالبيه من المسيحيين تعيش في غزه في حي الزيتون في المدينه القديمه، وينتمون الى الارثوذكسيه الشرقيه من القدس، والروم الكاثوليك، والطوائف المعمدانيه. في عام 1906، لم يكن هناك سوى 750 مسيحي، منهم 700 شخص يتبعون الارثوذكسيه و50 يتبعون الكنيسه الرومانيه الكاثوليكيه.\nاستوطن اليهود غزه منذ زمن،  في اسره يهوديه تعيش في غزه  غادر معظمهم من قطاع غزه بعد الثوره الفلسطينيه 1929، حينما تكون مجتمعهم من خمسين اسره. في احصائيات سامي هداوي للاراضي والسكان، كان عدد سكان غزه 34,250 نسمه، في عام 1945. غادر معظمهم من المدينه بعد حرب عام 1948، وذلك بسبب انعدام الثقه المتبادله بينهم وبين الاغلبيه العربيه.\nتحتوي غزه على العديد من مباني العباده القديمه من ابرزها الجامع العمري، كنيسه القديس برفيريوس ومسجد السيد هاشم حيث يرقد قبر جد الرسول محمد.\n\nالاقتصاد\nكانت المدينه ولا زالت مركزًا مُهمًا من حيث موقعها الاستراتيجي بين القارتين الاسيويه والافريقيه ووقوعها على شاطئ البحر الابيض المتوسط الذي يجعل منها ميناء مهما للتجاره واعمال الصيد، ولكن صعوبه نقل البضائع عبر المعابر مع اسرائيل وعدم سلاسه النقل مع مصر يجعل حجم التبادل التجاري ضئيلًا مع الحجم المفترض بسبب الموقع الجغرافي. نما الاقتصاد في غزه بنسبه 8% في الاشهر ال 11 الاولى من عام 2010، وبنسبه 5.4% في عام 2009، والنشاط الاقتصادي مدعوم الى حد كبير من خلال التبرعات والمساعدات الخارجيه، والذي يعتبر السبب الرئيسي وراء النمو الذي حدث مؤخرا. غزه مثلها كمثل اي مدينه فلسطينيه لا تملك عمله وطنيه، ويُستخدم الدينار الاردني والدولار الامريكي والشيكل الاسرائيلي. ويبلغ معدل الناتج المحلي للفرد 1,763 دولار امريكي (طبـقًا لاحصائيه 1997).\nبعد اتفاق اوسلو، تم توظيف الالاف من السكان في مختلف الوزارات والاجهزه الامنيه، في حين قامت وكاله الغوث والمنظمات الدوليه المختلفه التي تدعم تطوير المدينه بتوظيف اخرين.\nيوجد في غزه نقص خطير في مجال الاسكان والمرافق التعليميه والمرافق الصحيه والبنيه التحتيه وعدم كفايه نظام الصرف الصحي، وقد ساهمت كل منها بتهديد النظافه وانشاء مشاكل في الصحه العامه. هُناك عدد من الفنادق في غزه، مثل فندق فلسطين والقصر الكبير وادم والامل والقدس وكليف والديره وبيت مارنا. تقع الفنادق على طول حي الرمال باستثناء فندق فلسطين. لدى الامم المتحده نادي الشاطئ في الشارع نفسه. غزه ليست مقصد للسُياح، مُعظم الاجانب يقيمون في الفنادق وهم صحفيين وعمال الاغاثه والامم المتحده والعاملين في الصليب الاحمر. الفنادق الراقيه تشمل فندق القدس والديره.\nووفقًا لتقرير صدر مؤخرًا عن منظمه اوكسفام، تبلغ نسبه البطاله في غزه ما يقارب 40% ومن المُتوقع ان تصل الى 50%. وقد دُمر القطاع الخاص الذي يؤمن بدوره 53% من جميع الوظائف في غزه، وقد افلست الشركات، بالاضافه الى ان 75,000 عامل من اصل 110,000 هم الان من دون وظيفه. في عام 2008، تم تعليق 95% من العمليات الصناعيه في غزه بسبب عدم وجود المواد الخام للانتاج وعدم القُدره على تصدير ما يُنتج. في يونيو 2005، بلغ عدد المصانع في غزه 3,900 مصنع التي تُوظف 35,000 شخص، ولكن بحلول ديسمبر 2007، لم يبقَ سوى 195 مصنعًا التي تُوظف 1,700 شخص. اُصيبت صناعه البناء والتشييد بالشلل مع عشرات الالاف من العاطلين عن العمل. كما اُصيب القطاع الزراعي باضرارًا جسيمه وقرابه 40,000 عاملًا لا يحصلون على اي دخل وكانوا يعتمدون على الزراعه كمحصول نقدي.\nفي اغسطس 2009، وعدت حماس كل عامل ب100 دولار في شهر رمضان الكريم. ادى زياده الازدهار نوعًا ما الى استبدال واسع للعربات التي تجرها الحمير بالتوك توك. ووفقًا لصندوق النقد الدولي، انخفض معدل البطاله ونما الاقتصاد بنسبه 16% في النصف الاول من عام 2010، تقريبًا ضعف سرعه نمو الاقتصاد في الضفه الغربيه.\n الزراعه \n\nاشتهرت غزه قديماً بزراعه محاصيل القمح والشعير والقطن والزيتون. وتصديرها الى العالم العربي والخارجي، وفي غزه الان العديد من المزروعات وهي: البطاطا، والطماطم، والخيار، والعنب، والفراوله، والتين، والبطيخ، والشمام. وانتشرت فيها البيارات التي تزرع فيها اجود انواع الحمضيات كالليمون والبرتقال، والتي يعتمد البعض عليها في تغذيه النحل.\nويعتمد الري في مدينه غزه على مياه الابار، ويجري حالياً دراسات لتحليه مياه البحر تقوم بها البلديات في قطاع غزه. كما يعتمد الاقتصاد في غزه بدرجه كبيره على زراعه وتصدير الازهار الى مختلف دول العالم.\nويربي بعض سكان القطاع حالياً الاغنام والماشيه، ويعتمدون عليها في تسيير امور حياتهم، والتي تسهم كذلك في بعض الصناعات المحليه الخفيفه؛ فقد ساهمت بلديه غزه بانشاء مسلخ حديث ومتطور يتبع احدث القوانين الصحيه والعمليه ويعمل اوتوماتيكياً حسب احدث النظم والاساليب في العالم، ويعتبر من اكثر المسالخ تطوراً في الشرق الاوسط.\n الصناعه \nتشتهر غزه بصناعه عصر الزيتون والصابون الذي يعتمد على الزيت كماده اوليه كما تعتبر صناعه الفخار من اقدم الصناعات الفلسطينيه التي اشتهرت بها المدينه والتي تُباع في شوارع اسواق غزه، وكذلك صناعه الغزل والتطريز والبسط التراثيه من صوف الماشيه والنسيج والملابس القطنيه والاثاث المصنوع من الخيزران وصناعه الزجاج الملون كذلك. فقد تم انشاء قريه الفنون والحرف التي بُنِيَت من الطين على الطراز المعماري القديم، ويمارس عد من الحرفيين الصناعه التقليديه في تلك القريه. وافتُتَح مول غزه الحديث في يوليو 2010.\n\nالسياحه\nتعتمد السياحه في غزه بشكل رئيسي على البحر الذي تشتهر شواطئه برمالها الذهبيه البراقه. كما وتعتمد السياحه كذلك على المواقع الاثريه التاريخيه المنتشره في غزه. وتشتهر غزه كذلك بجوها المعتدل صيفاً وشتاءً والذي يشجع الناس بدوره، على ارتياد الشواطئ والحدائق والمنتزهات وعلى قضاء اوقاتهم في المزارع والبيارات وفي المرافق السياحيه.\nتضم غزه العديد من الاثار منها الرومانيه والمسيحيه، وتتنوع الاثار الاسلاميه بين المساجد والمدارس والزوايا والاسواق والقيساريات والاسبله والحمامات والقصور التي تجلت فيها روعه العماره والفنون الاسلاميه، علاوه على مكتبه مهمه احتوت على عديد من المخطوطات.\nان اقدم المواقع الاثريه بغزه تل العجول بجنوب المدينه على الضفه الشماليه لوادى غزه، وكان على هذا الموقع مدينه بيت جلايم الكنعانيه، ويعتقد ان موقع مدينه غزه القديمه كانت على هذا التل منذ 2000 ق.م. وتضم غزه اثاراً مسيحيه مثل دير القديس هيلاريون الذي يعتبر مؤسس حياه الرهبنه في فلسطين وكنيسه الروم الارثوذكس بحى الزيتون الذي يعود تاريخها الى بدايه القرن الخامس الميلادي واثاراً اسلاميه متنوعه منها المساجد الاثريه كمسجد السيد هاشم الذي يقع بحى الدرج بالمنطقه الشماليه الذي يعود للعصر المملوكي، وجدده السلطان عبد الحميد سنه 1850 م. وتحوى غزه زوايا كالزاويه الاحمديه بحي الدرج، علاوه على المنشات الاثريه المدنيه كالاسواق مثل سوق القيساريه بحى الدرج، وهو ملاصق للجدار الجنوبي للجامع العمرى الكبير، ويعود بناء السوق الى العصر المملوكي، ويتكون من شارع مغطى بقبو مدبب، وعلى جانبي هذا الشارع حوانيت صغيره مغطاه باقبيه متقاطعه يطلق عليه سوق القيساريه او سوق الذهب نسبه الى تجاره الذهب فيه، والقصور مثل قصر الباشا بحي الدرج المكون من طابقين، ويعود للعصر المملوكي وكان مقراً لنائب غزه في العصرين المملوكي والعثماني، والحمامات كحمام السمره بحي الزيتون، وهو احد النماذج الرائعه الباقيه للحمامات العثمانيه في فلسطين والحمام الوحيد الباقي لغايه الان في مدينه غزه.\nوكذلك تل الرقيش الذي اكتُشف فيه مستعمره تعود للعهد الفينيقي في هذا التل تحيطها اسوار دفاعيه ضخمه ويبلغ طولها حوالي (1600م).\n\nالثقافه\nالازياء والتطريز \nتعتبر غزه الموطن الاصلي الشاش، القماش من اجل «ثوب غزه» يتم نسجه بالقرب من المجدل (عسقلان). القطن الاسود او الازرق او المقلمه باللونان الزهري والاخضر، والتي تم تصنيعها في المجدل استمرت بالانتشار في باقي مناطق قطاع غزه من قبل اللاجئين من قرى السهل الساحلي حتى التسعينيات. يتميز الثوب الغزاوي باكمام ضيقه ومستقيمه. وكان التطريز اقل كثافه من تلك المطبقه في الخليل. ومن الزخرفيات تشمل: مقص، مشط وحجاب والتي رتبت في كثير من الاحيان في مجموعات ثلاثيه او خماسيه او سباعيه. ويعتبر استخدام الارقام الفرديه في الفولكلور العربي ان يكون فعالا ضد العين الحسود.\n المطبخ \nوقد تاثر المطبخ في قطاع غزه بالاكلات المجاوره حيث تاثرت بمصر بفضل موقعها على ساحل البحر المتوسط. الغذاء الرئيسي للغالبيه العظمى من سكان في المنطقه هو السمك. الصناعه الرئيسيه بغزه هي صيد الاسماك اما ان تكون مشويه او مقليه، وتتسم الاطعمه هناك باضافه الثوم والفلفل الاحمر والكمون ويتم نقعه في مزيج من الكزبره، الفلفل الاحمر، كمون، ثوم مفروم والليمون. التاثير المصري يظهر ايضا على جانب الاستخدام المُتكرر للفلفل الحار والثوم والشوندره نكهه لكثير من وجبات الطعام من قطاع غزه. الطبق الوطني لمنطقه غزه هو سماكيه.\nالمراكز الثقافيه والمتاحف\n\nتوجد في غزه عده مراكز ثقافيه منها مركز رشاد الشوا. تم الانتهاء من بناء مركز رشاد الشوا الثقافي في عام 1988 واطلق عليه اسم مؤسسه الامين السابق للمدينه ويقع في حي الرمال. البناء مكون من طابقان على شكل مثلث وتؤدي المراكز الثقافيه ثلاثه وظائف رئيسيه: مكان للتجمعات الكبيره خلال المهرجانات السنويه ومكان لتنظيم المعارض ومكتبه. المركز الثقافي الفرنسي هو رمز للتعاون والشراكه في قطاع غزه. تقدم المعارض الفنيه والحفلات الموسيقيه وعروض الافلام وغيرها من الانشطه. ويقدم دعوات للفنانين الفرنسيين لعرض اعمالهم الفنيه كلما امكن ذلك، ويقدم دعوات ايضًا الى الفنانين الفلسطينيين من قطاع غزه والضفه الغربيه للمشاركه في المسابقات الفنيه.\nانشئت في عام 1998 قريه الفنون والحرف وهي مركز ثقافي للاطفال التي تهدف الى التشجيع الشامل والمنتظم للفن الابداعي في جميع اشكاله. وتفاعل المركز مع فئه واسعه من الفنانين من جنسيات مختلفه، ونظم قرابه 100 معرض للفن الابداعي، والسيراميك، والرسومات، والمنحوتات وغيرها. وقد استفاد ما يقرب 10,000 طفل من مختلف انحاء قطاع غزه من قريه الفنون والحرف.\n\nالرياضه\nيقع ملعب فلسطين «الاستاد الوطني الفلسطيني»، في غزه ولديه القدره على استيعاب 10,000 شخصًا. وهو بمثابه موطن للمنتخب الفلسطيني لكره القدم، ولكن بعد غاره جويه اسرائيليه تضرر بشده ميدان الملعب، وقد لعبت مبارياته في الدوحه، قطر. تملك غزه الكثير من الانديه الرياضيه والتي تشارك في دوري قطاع غزه. وتشمل خدمات الشاطئ (مخيم الشاطئ)، اتحاد الشجاعيه، نادي غزه الرياضي ونادي الزيتون.\n\nالتعليم\nوفقًا للاحصاء الفلسطيني في عام 1997، كان اكثر من 90% من سكان غزه الذين تزيد اعمارهم على 10 يجيدون القراءه والكتابه. من سكان المدينه، كانوا 140,848 مسجلين في المدارس (39.8% في المدارس الابتدائيه، 33.8% في المدارس الثانويه، و 26.4% في المدارس الثانويه العامه). تلقى نحو 11,134 شخص شهادات البكالوريوس او الماجستير والدكتوراه.\nفي عام 2006، كان عدد المدارس في غزه 210، وتم تشغيل وبناء 151 منها من قبل وزاره التربيه والتعليم الفلسطينيه، و 46 من قبل وكاله الامم المتحده لاغاثه وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين في الشرق الادنى، و 13 مدرسه خاصه. التحق ما مجموعه 154,251 طالب وكانوا 5,877 يعملون مدرسين. اثر الاقتصاد المضطهد في الوقت الحالي في قطاع غزه. في سبتمبر 2007، كشف استطلاع للاونروا في قطاع غزه، ان الفشل ينتشر بنسبه 80% من الصف الرابع الى التاسع، وتصل نسبه الفشل في ماده الرياضيات الى 90%. في يناير 2008، افادت منظمه الامم المتحده للطفوله (يونيسف) ان المدارس في غزه قامت بالغاء الفئات التي كانت عاليه في استهلاك الطاقه، مثل تكنولوجيا المعلومات، ومختبرات العلوم والانشطه اللاصفيه.\nيوجد في مدينه غزه عده جامعات وهي: الجامعه الاسلاميه-غزه، جامعه الازهر-غزه، جامعه الاقصى-غزه (كليه التربيه سابقا)، جامعه فلسطين وجامعه الامه وجامعه القدس المفتوحه وهي تعتمد نظام التعليم المفتوح وتضم حوالي 40,000 طالباً. تاسست الجامعه الاسلاميه، التي تتالف من عشره كليات، من قبل احمد ياسين ومجموعه من رجال الاعمال في عام 1978، مما يجعلها اول مؤسسه للتعليم العالي في قطاع غزه. في (2006-2007)، فقد بلغ عدد الملتحقين بها 20,021 طالب وطالبه. جامعه الازهر في غزه والتي تاسست عام 1991، وتاسست جامعه الاقصى في عام 1991. بدات جامعه القدس المفتوحه تعليمها في مبنى مستاجر في وسط المدينه وكان ذلك عام 1992 وكان عدد الملتحقين بها 730 طالب وطالبه. بسبب الزياده السريعه في عدد الطلاب، تم تشيد اول مبنى جامعي في منطقه ناصر. في (2006-2007)، فقد بلغ عدد الملتحقين بها 3,778 طالب.\nوتقع المكتبه العامه في قطاع غزه قباله شارع الوحده، وتحتوي على ما يقارب 10,000 كتابًا في العربيه والانكليزيه والفرنسيه. ويبلغ مجموع مساحتها حوالي 1410 متر مربع (15,200 قدم مربعه)، ويتكون المبنى من دورين وسرداب. افتتحت المكتبه في عام 1999، بعد تعاون رئيس بلديه غزه عون الشوا وبلديه دونكيرك، والبنك الدولي. الاهداف الرئيسيه للمكتبه تتمثل بتوفير مصادر المعلومات لتلبيه احتياجات المستفيدين، وتوفير التسهيلات اللازمه من اجل الوصول الى مصادر المعلومات المتاحه، وتنظيم برامج ثقافيه متنوعه مثل النشاطات الثقافيه والندوات والمحاضرات والعروض السينمائيه والفيديو والفن ومعارض للكتب. وكذلك يوجد بها العديد من المراكز المهنيه والتدريبيه التابعه لوزاره التعليم العالي ووكاله الغوث.\n\nمشاكل التعليم في قطاع غزه\nهناك العديد من المشاكل التي تواجه التعليم في قطاع غزه متمثله في الاتي:\n- الاكتظاظ الطلابي الكبير في الفصول الدراسيه نتيجه لازدياد عدد الطلاب وقله عدد المدارس. حيث ادت الحروب المتتاليه الي تدمير المدارس، وادي الحصار الخانق الي صعوبه اعاده اعمارها\n- تعتبر المعابر من المشاكل التعليم في قطاع غزه. حيث استمرار اغلاق المعابر لفترات طويله يؤدي الي صعوبه التنقل للخارج واستكمال الدراسه\n- من المشاكل الاخرى التي تؤثر سلبا على التعليم مشكله التيار الكهربائي. حيث ادي الانقطاع المستمر للتيار الكهربائي بمعدل 8 ساعات يوميا الي صعوبه مواكبه الطلاب دراستهم وواجباتهم اليوميه.\n\nالمعالم\nالبنيه التحتيه\nالخدمات\nامدادات المياه والصرف الصحي\nووفقًا لتعداد المكتب المركزي للاحصاء الفلسطيني عام 1997، فقد كان 98,1% من سكان غزه يملُكون امدادات المياه العامه في حين ان البقيه يستخدمون النظام الخاص. تم ربط حوالي 87.6% الى نظام الصرف الصحي العام و 11.8% يستخدمون البالوعه.\nبسبب القيود الشديده التي فُرضت على امدادات المياه في غزه، ونظام الصرف بها. لم تعد تعمل الابار السته الرئيسيه لمياه الشرب، وحوالي 50% من السكان لا يحصُلون على المياه بشكل منتظم. يتسرب يوميًا حوالي 20 مليون لتر من مياه الصرف الصحي الخام و40 مليون لتر من المياه المعالجه جُزئيًا في البحر الابيض المتوسط نظرًا لقطع الكهرباء وعدم وجود الوقود وقطع الغيار في محطات المعالجه في قطاع غزه. وتزعم البلديه ان تراكم القمامه في الشوارع والطرق وفي الابار، وفيضانات مياه الصرف الصحي في تتسبب خطر تفشي الامراض والاوبئه الحشريه، وكذلك الفئران وفي المناطق السكنيه.\nالرعايه الصحيه\n\nتوجد في المدنيه عده مشافي منها مستشفى القدس، والذي يقع في حي تل الهوى، ويديرُه جمعيه الهلال الاحمر الفلسطيني، ويعد ثاني اكبر مستشفى في غزه.\nونتيجه القيود الصارمه على الوقود والكهرباء؛ تُعاني المستشفيات حاليًا من انقطاع التيار الكهربائي الدائم الذي يصل الى 8-12 ساعه يوميًا. يُوجد حاليًا نقص 60-70 في المئه في وقود الديزل اللازم لمولدات الكهرباء التي اُبلغ عنها. ووفقًا لمنظمه الصحه العالميه، تم رفض تصاريح مغادره 18.5% من المرضى الذين قدموا تصاريح لكي يتلقوا العلاج الطارئ في المستشفيات خارج قطاع غزه في عام 2007.\nالنقل والمواصلات\n\nيمتد شارع رشيد الساحلي والذي يمتد على طول ساحل غزه ويربطها مع بقيه الساحل الشمالي في قطاع غزه ومع جنوبه. الطريق الرئيسي في قطاع غزه، هو شارع صلاح الدين (فيا ماريس الحديثه) والذي يمر عبر وسط مدينه غزه، والذي يربط بدوره دير البلح وخان يونس ورفح في جنوب القطاع وجباليا وبيت حانون في شمال قطاع غزه. المعبر الشمالي من شارع صلاح الدين في اسرائيل هو معبر بيت حانون ومعبر من مصر هو معبر رفح. وقد تم اغلاق المعابر من قبل اسرائيل ومصر منذ عام 2007، ولكن بعد الثوره المصريه قد تم اعاده فتح معبر رفح ولن دون تغيرات تذكر.\nيعتبر شارع عمر المختار الشارع الرئيسي في مدينه غزه للتنقل من الشرق الى الغرب وبالعكس، وهو فرع من شارع صلاح الدين، والذي يمتد من ساحل الرمال في المدينه القديمه وينتهي في سوق الذهب. وقبل الحصار المفروض على قطاع غزه، كان هناك خطوط منتظمه لسيارات الاجره نحو مدينتان رام الله، القدس والخليل في الضفه الغربيه.\nمطار ياسر عرفات الدولي والذي تم افتتاحه عام 1998 بالقرب من مدينه رفح، ويقع على بعد 40 كم (25 ميل) جنوب قطاع غزه. تضررت المدارجات والمنشات التابعه للمطار الى حد كبير خلال الانتفاضه الفلسطينيه الثانيه على يد الجيش الاسرائيلي وهو معطل عن العمل حالياً. يقع مطار بن غوريون الدولي في اسرائيل على بعد 75 كم (47 ميل) شمال شرق المدينه.، وبطبيعه الحال لا يمكن استخدامه من قبل المواطنين الفلسطينيين.\n\nمعاناه المدينه\nالحصار\n\nتقوم السلطات الاسرائيليه بحصار قطاع غزه وبالتالي المدينه حصاراً كاملاً حيث تمنع السفر من والى غزه وتمنع عنها مواد البناء والمواد التموينيه والادويه والمحروقات بانواعها، وقد دمر هذا الحصار الاقتصاد الغزاوي بشكل شبه كامل. وفي اوائل سنه 2009 بدات اسرائيل في ضرب قطاع غزه كاملاً. وقد زعمت اسرائيل بان حماس تهدد امنها وسكانها.\nولكن الشعب الفلسطيني ولم يستسلم وانما بادر بشق الانفاق عند حدود الاراضي المصريه، وساعدت هذه الانفاق بدخول جميع مستلزمات الحياه من مواد غذائيه ومواد بناء واسلحه واجهزه كهربائيه والسيارات. وبعد عام من شن اسرائيل الحرب على غزه قاموا بعقد عده اتفاقيات وتهدئات ساهمت بتهدئه الوضع في قطاع غزه وفتح معبر رفح والسماح للمُسافرين بالدخول والخروج من المدينه ولكن بتنسيق من حُكومه حماس المُقاله والسلطه المصريه.\nما زال المواطن الفلسطيني يعاني من ازمه الغلاء المعيشي بالاضافه للمعونات التي تقدم للمواطنين فهي تقدم فقط لعائلات معينه وليس للجميع. ومع ذلك فان سكان قطاع غزه يعيشون في نعيم اكثر من الضفه الغربيه باستثناء تواصل انقطاع التيار الكهربائي بحجه عدم وجود الوقود.\nمجزره غزه\n\nمجزره غزه او محرقه غزه هي عمليه اسرائيليه جرت في قطاع غزه على مدار خمسه ايام في شهر فبراير 2008 بدعوى القضاء على عناصر حركه حماس المطلقه للصواريخ على الاراضي الاسرائيليه. وقد جاءت هذه التسميه بعد ان وصف وزير الدفاع الاسرائيلي ايهود باراك ما تفعله القوات الاسرائيليه في غزه بهولوكوست او اباده عرقيه او محرقه للفلسطينيين في قطاع غزه اثر مقتل جنديين اسرائيليين على يد عناصر من حركه حماس اثناء مقاوماتها للقوات الاسرائيليه؛ فتبنى التسميه عدد كبير من الكتاب والمفكرين والشخصيات السياسيه والدينيه العرب والمسلمين، حيث يرونها اسم مناسب للعمليه، حيث راح ضحيتها 116 شخص من ضمنهم 26 طفلاً فضلاً عن غيرهم من المدنيين ما بين قتيل وجريح. وفي نفس اليوم الذي اعلنت فيه انتهاء العمليات العسكريه في غزه؛ اعلنت مصادر اسرائيليه انها كانت مرحله اولى، وانه قد تكون هناك عمليات اخرى في القريب.\nالعدوان شنته قوات الاحتلال منذ يوم 27 ديسمبر 2008 على قطاع غزه. وقد ذهب ضحيه لهذا العدوان حتى اليوم العشرون ما يزيد على 5,000 مدني شهيد اكثرهم من النساء والاطفال وما يقارب الـ 8,000 جريح من المدنيين، ومعظم الجرحى اصبحوا عاجزين اما اهل غزه فقد ظلوا صابرين يواجهون اكبر ترسانه عسكريه بصُدور عاريه وقُلوب ثابته في مواجهه 10,000 طن من القنابل القُيت عليهم ومنها قنابل محرمه دوليًا.\nوقد شهدت فتره العدوان اكبر انتفاضه عالميه ضد المجزره التي ترتكبها اسرائيل ضد اطفال ونساء وعجائز غزه، حيث عرضت وسائل الاعلام صوراً بشعه من غزه هزت العالم فنزلت الشعوب بمئات الالوف تبكي في الشوارع وتطالب بالتحرك لوقف العدوان والجرائم والمحارق والقنابل الاسرائيليه، واصبحت غزه مدينه عالميه ورمزاً فلسطينياً كبيراً. وقام بعض الفنانين العربيين والعالميين بابداء دعمهم وتاييدهم لنضال الغزاويين ومواساتهم في كارثتهم. ومنهم اول مغني امريكي يغني لغزه وهو مايكل هارت.\nوقد اعلن المسؤولون الاسرائيليون امتداد العمليات العسكريه «حسب الحاجه»، في الوقت الذي ما زالت فيه الدول العربيه تتجادل فيما بينها علي ضروره عقد قمه عربيه طارئه. علمًا بان قطر نادت بعقد قمه عربيه مُنذ بدايه العدوان الاسرائيلي على غزه لمُناصره الشعب فيها.\nوجاء هذا مصاحبا لمجهودات دوليه تندد بالهجمات بوصفها هجمات همجيه ووحشيه وغير انسانيه البته وقد قامت مظاهرات غاضبه في بلدان العالم تندد بالمجزره. وبعد مرور 22 يوماً توقفت الحرب وانسحبت قوات الصهاينه مهزومه لانها لم تحقق اهدافها. وخلفت وراءها اكثر من 5000 شهيد واكثر من 8000 جريح واكثر من 20000 منزل مدمر.\nالجدار الفولاذي\n\nفي ديسمبر 2009، اعلنت مصر عزمها بناء الجدار الفولاذي تحت الارض بين رفح المصريه وقطاع غزه يصل الى عمق 30 مترًا وطول 10 كم، من اجل وقف تسلل الفلسطينيين وتهريب السلاح الى الاراضي المصريه، ووقف تهريب البضائع المصريه بمُختلف انواعها للاراضي المحتله.\nحيث ان الهدف من انشاء هذا الجدار العازل هو القضاء على الانفاق التي تصل بين مصر وقطاع غزه، وحيث ان هذه الانفاق هي المدخل الوحيد الان لكل احتياجات الشعب الفلسطيني في قطاع غزه بعد ان فرضت مصر الحصار على معبر رفح وهو المنفذ الوحيد لغزه على العالم، وضيقت الخناق على اهل غزه، وهناك قضيه مرفوعه الان في مصر ضد قانونيه هذا الجدار.\n\nالحكومه\nاليوم، تُعد غزه العاصمه الاداريه لمحافظه غزه. وتحتوي على مبنى المجلس التشريعي الفلسطيني، وكذلك المقر الرئيسي لمعظم وزارات السلطه الفلسطينيه.\nتم تشكيل اول مجلس بلدي في غزه عام 1893 برئاسه علي خليل الشوا. قامت السلطات العثمانيه بتعيين ابنه سعيد الشوا عام 1906 عمده للمدينه. اشرف الشوا على بناء اول مستشفى في غزه وعده مساجد ومدارس وترميم الجامع الكبير وادخال المحراث الحديث للمدينه.\n\nفي 24 يوليو 1994، اعلنت السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه في غزه وتم تاسيس مجلس المدينه الاول في الاراضي الفلسطينيه. لم تعقد الانتخابات البلديه الفلسطينيه في غزه ولا في رفح او في خان يونس. بدلاً من ذلك، اختارت حركه فتح مسؤولي الحزب في المدن الصغيره والبلدات والقرى لاجراء الانتخابات مع افتراض انهم سيفعلون ما هو افضل في المناطق الاقل حضريه. مع ذلك، فازت حماس المنافسه باغلبيه المقاعد، اذ حصلت على سبعه من بين 10 بلديات تم اختيارها لاول جوله ووصلت نسبه الاقبال على التصويت الى 80% تقريباً. شهد عام 2007 مواجهات عنيفه بين الطرفين خلّفت اكثر من 100 قتيل، مما ادى في نهايه المطاف الى سيطره حماس على المدينه.\nبشكل طبيعي، فان البلديات الفلسطينيه التي يزيد عدد سكانها عن 20,000 نسمه تكون بمثابه مراكز اداريه لها مجالس بلديه، ويتشكل المجلس البلدي الحالي في غزه من 11 عضواً، بينهم رئيس البلديه نزار حجازي.\n\nرؤساء البلديه\nالمدن المتوامه\nالمراجع\nوصلات خارجيه\n\nموقع بلديه غزه\nمتحف شهداء محرقه غزه 2009",
      "summary": "غَزَّة مدينة ساحلية فلسطينية، وأكبر مدن قطاع غزة وتقع في شماله، في الطرف الجنوبي للساحل الشرقي من البحر المتوسط. تبعد عن مدينة القدس مسافة 78 كم إلى الجنوب الغربي، ويحدها من الشمال الشرقي أراضي مدينة الخليل الغربية المحتلة منذ عام 1948 وهي مركز محافظة غزة إداريًا وأكبر مدن قطاع غزة، فمن حيث تعداد السكان بلغ عدد سكان المدينة 2,141,000 نسمة في عام 2023م، ما يجعلها أكبر تجمع للفلسطينيين في فلسطين. تبلغ مساحتها 56 كم2، مما يجعلها من أكثر المدن كثافة بالسكان في العالم.\nتعتبر مدينة غزة من أهم المدن الفلسطينية؛ لأهمية موقعها الاستراتيجي والأهمية الاقتصادية والعمرانية للمدينة، بالإضافة إلى كونها المقر المؤقت للسلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية، ووجود الكثير من مقراتها ووزارتها فيها.\nأسس المدينة الكنعانيون في القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، احتلها الكثير من الغزاة كالفراعنة والإغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والعثمانيين والإنجليز وغيرهم. في عام 635م دخل المسلمون العرب المدينة وأصبحت مركزاً إسلامياً مهماً. يوجد بها قبر هاشم بن عبد مناف الجد الثاني للنبي محمد بن عبد الله، لذلك تُسمى أيضاً غزة هاشم، كما أنها مسقط رأس الإمام الشافعي الذي ولد عام 767م وهو أحد أئمة المذاهب الأربعة عند المسلمين السنة.\nفي التاريخ المعاصر، سقطت غزة في أيدي القوات البريطانية أثناء الحرب العالمية الأولى، وأصبحت جزءاً من الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ونتيجة للحرب العربية الإسرائيلية عام 1948م، تولت مصر إدارة أراضي قطاع غزة وأجرت عدة تحسينات على المدينة. احتلت إسرائيل قطاع غزة عام 1967م (عام النكسة)، وبعد اتفاقية أوسلو بين منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية وإسرائيل عام 1993م، بموجب اتفاق غزة-أريحا الموقَّع في 4 مايو عام 1994م انتقلت السلطة المدنية إلى سلطة الحكم الذاتي الفلسطيني. بعد انتخابات عام 2006م اندلع قتال بين حركة فتح وحركة المقاومة الإسلامية حماس، حيث رفضت حركة فتح نقل السلطة في غزة إلى حركة حماس، ومنذ ذلك الحين وقعت غزة تحت الحصار من قبل إسرائيل ومصر. بعد الثورة المصرية في 25 يناير 2011م، فتحت مصر معبر رفح من أجل التسهيل على مواطني غزة، مع أن هذا القرار لم يُشكِّل فارقاً كبيراً.\nالأنشطة الاقتصادية الرئيسية في قطاع غزة هي الصناعات الصغيرة والزراعة والعمل، ومع ذلك، فقد دُمِّر الاقتصاد من خلال الحصار الإسرائيلي والصراعات المتكررة.",
