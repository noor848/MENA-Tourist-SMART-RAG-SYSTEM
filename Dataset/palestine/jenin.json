      "content": "Jenin ( zhin-EEN; Arabic: جنين, romanized: Jinīn, locally pronounced [ʒɪˈniːn] ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and is the capital of the Jenin Governorate. It is a hub for the surrounding towns. Jenin came under Israeli occupation in 1967, and was put under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank, a Palestinian enclave, in 1995.\nThe city had a population of approximately 50,000 people in 2017, whilst the Jenin refugee camp had a population of about 10,000, housing families of Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 Palestine War. The camp has since become a stronghold of Palestinian militants, being the location of several incidents relating to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.\n\nEtymology\nJenin has been identified as the place \"Gina\" or \"Ginah\" mentioned in the Amarna letters from the 14th century BCE, as a town in Canaan. Jenin is commonly identified with the later biblical city of Ein-Ganim, from Hebrew: עֵין גַּנִּים, meaning \"the spring of gardens\" or \"the spring of Ganim\", probably referring to the many springs located nearby. The present-day Arabic name is believed to preserve the city's ancient name.\n\nHistory\nAncient period\nJenin is identified with a number of important towns mentioned in ancient sources. Throughout history, it was referred to as \"Ein Ganim\", \"Beth Hagan\", \"Ginah\", and \"Ginae\", along other names.\nTell Jenin, believed to constitute the original settlement core of the city, is located at the center of what is today Jenin's business district. The tell is also known as Tell el-Nawar, a term derived from the Arabic word for \"gypsies,\" due to former nomadic encampments in this site. The earliest settlement at the tell dates to the late Neolithic and the early Chalcolithic. In the early 20th century, the tell was occupied by a modern cemetery and a threshing floor.\n\nBronze Age\nJenin has been identified as the place Gina or Ginah mentioned in the Amarna letters from the 14th century BCE. At the time, it was a vassal state of the New Kingdom of Egypt. The people of Gina managed to kill the warlord Labaya during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten.\n\nIron Age\nJenin is identical to Ein-Ganim, which the Hebrew Bible describes as a Levite city belonging to the Israelite Tribe of Issachar. It has also been associated with Beth-Haggan, mentioned in 2 Kings in connection with Ahaziah's flight from Jehu, before he is wounded at Ibleam and later dies in Megiddo. The Book of Judith renders its name as Gini.\n\nRoman and Byzantine periods\nJosephus, a Roman-Jewish historian of the 1st-century CE, mentions Ginae as being in the great plain, on the northern border of Samaria. During the Roman period, Ginae was settled exclusively by Samaritans. The people of Galilee were disposed to pass through their city during the annual pilgrimages to Jerusalem. In 51 CE, a Galilean Jew was killed in Ginae by hostile Samaritans while en route to Jerusalem to celebrate Sukkot. With Roman procurator Cumanus failing to respond, Jewish Zealots led by Elazar the Son of Deinaeus (Ben Dinai) sought vengeance, and several Samaritan villages in Aqrabatene were destroyed.\nBiblical commentator F. W. Farrar raised the possibility that this Samaritan village, \"the first village at which [a traveler taking the road from Galilee to Judea over Mount Tabor] would arrive\", was the one which rejected the disciples of Jesus in Luke's Gospel at the point where Jesus and his followers begin his journey towards Jerusalem.\nCeramics dating from the Byzantine era have been found here. There is no mention of Jenin in the reports of the Muslim conquest of the Levant from the Byzantines, which, according to the historian Moshe Sharon, \"is not surprising, since it was a small place of minor importance\".\n\nCrusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk periods\nJenin came under Crusader rule in 1103. The Crusaders called it Le Grand Guerin (Latin: Garinum or Gallina Major), to distinguish it from the town of Zir'in, which they called Petit Grin. Under the Crusaders it was a small seigniory, forming part of the Principality of Galilee or the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\nShortly before the Battle of Hattin in 1187, Jenin was captured by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin, who destroyed the nearby fort, Castellum Beleismum. In the 1220s, the geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi described Jenin as \"a small and beautiful town, lying between Nabulus and Beisan, in the Jordan Province. There is much water, and many springs are found here, and often have I visited it.\" In 1229, a peace was concluded between Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and Sultan al-Kamil, during the Sixth Crusade, whereby the city was given to the Crusaders, but Sultan as-Salih Ayyub was able to control it permanently in 1244 after the Battle of La Forbie.\nIn 1255, it was agreed between the Ayyubid sultan in Syria, an-Nasir Yusuf, and the first Mamluk sultan in Egypt, Izz al-Din Aybak, to give the latter all of the lands lying west of the Jordan River, and thus Jenin entered into the possession of the Mamluks. It was one of eleven subdistricts of Mamlakat Safad (Province of Safed). In the late 13th century, Mamluk emirs (commanders) stationed at Jenin were ordered by Sultan Qalawun (r. 1279–1290) \"to ride every day with their troops before the fortress of 'Akka, so as to protect the coast and the merchants.\" As one of the stations of the Mamluk barid (postal route) between the Mamluk capital Cairo and Damascus, it was one of the towns where fires were lit to warn of a Mongol attack. The geographer al-Dimashqi mentioned Jenin around 1300. From the time of Qalawun's son, Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1299–1309, 1310–1341), it was a station on the route where ice was transported to Cairo for the sultans' drink houses. The Mamluk historian al-Qalqashandi (d. 1418) described Jenin as \"an ancient spacious town which is riding on a shoulder of a nice valley in which there is a river of flowing water\" north of Qaqun \"on the top end of Marj Bani Amer [Jezreel Valley]\". He also noted that it contained the mausoleum of Dihyah al-Kalbi, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nOttoman era\nThe Ottomans conquered Mamluk Syria in 1516. Jenin became the administrative center of a nahiya (subdistrict) of the Lajjun Sanjak (Lajjun District). The sanjak was officially called the Iqta (Fief) of Turabay until 1559 when it became officially known as the Lajjun Sanjak. The Turabay dynasty was the ruling house of the Bedouin Banu Haritha tribe, whose members held the governorship of Lajjun from the start of Ottoman rule through 1677.\nThe tax registers from 1548 to 1549 report that Jenin had a population of eight households, all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 2,000 akçe. All of the revenue went to a waqf (religious endowment) in the name of the Mamluk sultan Qansuh al-Ghuri (r. 1501–1516). Turabay rule was occasionally interrupted, including in 1564, when a certain Kemal Bey was appointed sanjak-bey (district governor) by the Ottomans. On 15 October 1564 Kemal Bey requested from the beylerbey (provincial governor) of Damascus that the stone caravanserai of Jenin be repaired, garrisoned and serve as the chief headquarters of the Lajjun sanjak-bey in order for Lajjun to prosper and for the road connecting Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt to become secure. The official response was that the caravanserai be turned into a fortress; the fortress became ruined at some later point and 19th-century residents of Jenin used to claim that certain large rocks strewn in the village were the remnants of the 16th-century fortress.\nThe Turabays, who remained nomads in the plain between Mount Carmel and Caesarea, made Jenin the administrative headquarters of Lajjun and used the town's Izz al-Din Cemetery to bury their dead. A large, domed mausoleum was built for the grave of one of the chiefs and sanjak-beys of the family, Turabay ibn Ali (d. 1601). Known as Qubbat al-Amir Turabay (Dome of the Emir Turabay), it was described in a 1941 report as a ruined structure, and Sharon, writing in 2017, notes that it \"does not exist anymore\". No other graves of the Turabays in Jenin had survived into the 20th century. During the conflict between Fakhr al-Din of the Ma'n dynasty, who governed the sanjaks of Sidon-Beirut and Safed, and the Turabays, in 1623, Fakhr al-Din captured Jenin and stationed his men there. In 1624 the most prominent Turabay chief and sanjak-bey of Lajjun, Ahmad ibn Turabay, drove out the Ma'nid troops from Jenin and established his personal residence in the town.\nIn the mid-18th century, Jenin was designated the administrative capital of the combined districts of Lajjun and Ajlun. There are indications that the area comprising Jenin and Nablus remained functionally autonomous under Ottoman rule and that the empire struggled to collect taxes there. During the Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt which extended into Syria and Palestine in 1799, a local official from Jenin wrote a poem enumerating and calling upon local Arab leaders to resist Bonaparte, without mentioning the Sultan or the need to protect the Ottoman Empire.\nIn the late 19th century, some members of the Jarrar family, who formed part of the mallakin (elite land-owning families) in Jenin, cooperated with merchants in Haifa to set up an export enterprise there. During the Ottoman era, Jenin was plagued by local warfare between members of the same clan. The French explorer Guérin visited in 1870. In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Jenin as \"The capital of the district, the seat of a Caimacam, a town of about 3,000 inhabitants, with a small bazaar. The houses are well built of stone. There are two families of Roman Catholics; the remainder are Moslems. A spring rises east of the town and is conducted to a large masonry reservoir, near the west side, of good squared stonework, with a long stone trough. This reservoir was built by 'And el Hady, Mudir of Acre, in the first half of the century  [..], north of the town is the little mosque of 'Ezz ed Din, with a good- sized dome and a minaret.\"\n\nBritish Mandate period\nAccording to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Jenin had a population of 2,637 (2,307 Muslims, 212 Hindus, 108 Christians, seven Jews, and three Sikhs). A following census in 1931 showed a slight increase to 2,706 (2,610 Muslims, 103 Christians, two Jews, and one Druze) with another 68 in nearby suburbs (all Muslims). From 1936, Jenin became a center of rebellion against the British Mandatory authorities. By the summer of 1938, residents of the city embarked on \"an intensified campaign of murder, intimidation and sabotage\" that caused the British administration \"grave concern\", according to a British report to the League of Nations; the population had further increased to 3,100. The city played an important role in the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, prompted by the death of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam in a fire-fight with British colonial police at the nearby town of Ya'bad months prior to the start of the revolt. On 25 August 1938, the day after the British Assistant District Commissioner was assassinated in his Jenin office, a large British force with explosives entered the town. Despite having captured and killed the assassin, British forces ordered the inhabitants to leave, and blew up one quarter of the town as a form of punishment.\nJenin was used by Fawzi al-Qawuqji's Arab Liberation Army as a base.\nThe village statistics of 1945 list the population as 3,990 (3,840 Muslims and 150 Christians).\n\n1948 War\nIn the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the city was defended by the Iraqi Army, then captured briefly by the forces from Israel's Carmeli Brigade during the \"Ten Days' fighting\" following the cancellation of the first cease-fire. Prior to the battle, the city's residents fled temporarily. The offensive was actually a feint designed to draw Arab forces away from the critical Battle for Jerusalem, and gains in that sector were quickly abandoned when Arab reinforcements arrived.\n\nJordanian control\nIn the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Jenin came under Jordanian rule. It was annexed by Jordan in 1950.\nThe Jenin refugee camp was founded in 1953 by Jordan to house displaced Palestinians who fled or were expelled during the 1948 War. In 2014 the camp had a population of 16,000. For 19 years, the city was under Jordanian control. A war cemetery for Iraqi soldiers and local combatants is located on the outskirts of Jenin.\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 14,402 inhabitants in Jenin.\n\nIsraeli occupation 1967 to 2020\nJenin has been under Israeli occupation since the Six-Day War, in 1967.\nOn 14 May 1989, during the early months of the First Intifada. Mohammad Jibrin, aged 45, died in Ramallah Hospital after being beaten by Israeli soldiers in Jenin. Three months later, in response to a question from a member of Knesset Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin wrote that there was no investigation by the Military Police Investigator.\nAccording to Joel Beinin, Jenin was classified as under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank, a Palestinian enclave, in 1995. In 1996, Israel handed over control of the city to the Palestinian National Authority in keeping with the Oslo Accords.\nAccording to the BBC, the city is \"Known among Palestinians\" as \"the Martyrs' capital\", but the reason they gave was Israeli statistics about suicide bombings, the BBC did not identify any non-Israeli source for the name. During the Second Palestinian uprising (also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada) the camp's militants, some 200 armed men, included members of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, Tanzim, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas. By Israel's count, at least 28 suicide bombers were dispatched from the Jenin camp from 2000 to 2003 during the Second Intifada. Israeli army weekly Bamahane attributes at least 31 militant attacks, totaling 124 victims, to Jenin during the same period, more than any other city in the West Bank.\nDuring the al-Aqsa Intifada, Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield with the stated aim of dismantling militant infrastructure so as to curb suicide bombings and other militant activities. The army encircled and entered six major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank, among them Jenin. During the Battle of Jenin (2002) in April 2002, 23 Israeli soldiers and 52 Palestinians, including civilians,  were killed. Human Rights Watch reported that the refugee camp, which was the major battleground, suffered extensive damage. Witnesses stated unarmed people were shot and denied medical treatment, and as a result died. Human Rights Watch have regarded many killings to be unlawful such as the death of a 57-year-old wheelchair bound man who was shot and run over by a tank despite having attached a white flag on his wheelchair. A 37-year-old man who was paralysed was crushed under the rubble of his house, his family was not allowed to remove his body. A 14-year-old boy was killed as he travelled to purchase groceries during the temporary relief of the curfew that was imposed by the army. Medical staff were shot at (one nurse killed) while trying to reach the wounded even after clearly being in uniform displaying the red crescent symbol. There have also been reports of Israeli soldiers using Palestinians as human shields, one father described how a soldier rested his rifle on his 14-year-old son's shoulder as he shot. Israel denied the entry of rescue teams and journalists into Jenin even after they withdrew. Over the following years, Jenin was subject to extended curfews and targeted killings.\nDuring a gun-battle with Islamic Jihad militants whom Israel says were firing at troops from inside the UN compound, an Israeli military sniper shot and killed a UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) employee, Iain Hook (54) on November 22, 2002. The sniper reportedly mistook a cellphone in Hook's hands for a gun or grenade.\n\nIn the framework of the Valley of Peace initiative, a joint Arab-Israeli project is under way to promote tourism in the Jenin region. In 2010, 600 new businesses opened in Jenin. The Canaan Fair Trade is headquartered in Jenin. Director of The Freedom Theatre in Jenin, Juliano Mer-Khamis, was killed by masked gunmen in the city in April 2011. Mer-Khamis co-founded the theatre with Zakaria Zubeidi, former military chief of the al-Aqsa Brigades who had renounced violence.\n\nIsraeli occupation in the 2020s\nOn 6 February 2020, a Palestinian policeman, Tarek Badwan, was shot dead by an Israeli sniper as he stood at the entrance to the Jenin police station and chatted with a colleague. No explanation has been forthcoming. The incident was recorded on video.\nOn 17 June 2022, Israeli forces conducted a raid in the al-Marah area of the city. During the raid, Israeli forces opened fire on a car, killing three Palestinians and seriously injuring another.\n\nOn 26 January 2023, Israeli forces killed nine in a clash with Islamic Jihad militants during a raid in the city and refugee camp of Jenin.\nOn 3 July 2023, shortly after 1 a.m., Israeli forces attacked the city's refugee camp using drone-fired missiles and ground troops. Eight Palestinians died from injuries sustained during the attack and a further eighty were injured, nine of them critically. Fifty Palestinians, whom Israeli forces labeled \"militants\", were arrested. Israeli forces cut off telecommunications and electricity in the area and medical professionals struggled to reach the injured. Israel claimed that while they were targeting suspected members of the Jenin Brigades, an armed group, they acknowledged that innocent people may have been injured or killed in the raid. Yoav Gallant, the Israeli Minister of Defense, said \"The operation is progressing as planned,\" and Eli Cohen, the Israeli Foreign Minister, said claimed the refugee camp had become a \"center for terrorist activity\" thanks to funding from Iranian sources. The refugee camp has a population of roughly 17,000 inhabitants and is about a quarter a square mile in size.\nOn 19 September 2023, four Palestinians were killed during another Israeli military invasion of the city – among them a 15-year-old Palestinian boy, chased and killed for having noticed the Israeli undercover soldiers sneaking into the Jenin refugee camp.\n\nGaza war\nDuring the Gaza war, Israeli forces carried out multiple operations in Jenin. On October 22, 2023, the IDF conducted an airstrike targeting an underground compound beneath the Al-Ansar Mosque in the city. It was reported to be the first airstrike in the West Bank since the Second Intifada. The IDF stated that the strike aimed at operatives from Hamas and PIJ who were planning a terror attack.\nJenin was severely damaged during the Gaza war. By June 2024 repeated bombing attacks and incursions with bulldozers by Israeli forces razed every street and reduced every public square to rubble. In one incident on 21 May, according to journalist Gideon Levy, an Israeli sniper shot dead bystanders, including surgeon Oussaid Jabareen, who was shot while on his way to work at the Jenin Government Hospital.\n\nIn late August 2024 Israel launched a large-scale, multi-day raid on Jenin as part of Operation Summer Camps, with one resident saying that \"The water is cut off. The electricity is cut off, the sewage system is no longer working. All the infrastructure is destroyed, we no longer have any services that work.\" The governor of Jenin said that \"The Israelis are besieging the hospitals and cutting off the city from the refugee camp, which has become a military zone with no access...neither the civil defence, nor the ambulances, nor the journalists can go and see what is happening there.\" The IDF, on the other hand, says that this is operation is \"not extremely different from regular activity\". At least 20 Palestinians were killed by the IDF in this attack, including a Palestinian man in his 80s. Additionally, the Israeli forces fired at ambulances carrying \"a dead and a wounded person\", leading to the injury of 2 EMTs and a volunteer doctor.\nAlso in August, Israeli bulldozers destroyed miles of the city, including homes, businesses and infrastructure; Israeli soldiers blocked emergency responders from assisting residents. News reports include videos of this attack, as well as assertions by the Israel Defense Forces that it is rooting out terrorism; and that it \"undertakes all feasible precautions to avoid damaging essential infrastructure”, while acknowledging that these “operations in the area have caused unavoidable harm to certain civilian structures\".\nIn December 2024, the Palestinian Authority launched an anti-militant operation in Jenin, the largest in three decades, called \"Protect the Homeland\". The operation aims to regain control of the Jenin refugee camp, targeting militants and those fueling instability.\nOn January 21, 2025, the IDF launched its own operation in Jenin, dubbed Iron Wall, aimed at clearing Jenin of militants and putting a stop to light arms being smuggled into the city. Operations in Jenin were ongoing as of late February 2025. Around 100 homes had been demolished, residents were being prevented from returning to the area by military checkpoints, and Israeli tanks had been deployed.\n\nGeography\nJenin is situated at the foot of the rugged northernmost hills (Jabal Nablus) of the West Bank, and along the southern edge of the Jezreel Valley (Marj Ibn Amer), which the city overlooks. Its highest elevation is about 250 meters above sea level and its lowest areas are 90 meters above sea level. Immediately southwest of Jenin is the Sahl Arraba plain (Dothan Valley), while further south is the Marj Sanur valley.

Six seats each were won by Hamas and the local coalition of Fatah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Jenin was one of several Palestinian cities where Hamas showed a dramatic growth in electoral support.\n Hadem Rida was then elected as Mayor of the city, until he was arrested by the Israel Forces and spent 3 years in jail. After his release, he resigned from the position and went back to practice in his clinic in Jenin city.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2017 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Jenin had a population of 49,908, the Jenin Refugee Camp of 10,417 on 373 dunams (92 acres).

      "content": "جِنِين مدينه فلسطينيه، ومركز محافظه جنين واكبر مدنها، تقع في شمال الضفه الغربيه المحتله التابعه للسلطه الفلسطينيه. تعتبر تاريخيًا، احدى مدن المثلث في شمال فلسطين، وتبعد عن القدس مسافه 75 كيلومترًا الى الشمال. تطل جنين على غور الاردن من ناحيه الشرق، ومرج بن عامر الى جهه الشمال.\nبالرغم من قله عدد سكانها حتى تاريخ وقوع النكبه مقارنه بالمدن الفلسطينيه الاخرى، الا ان لها ثقلا اقتصاديا اكبر بكثير من حجمها السكاني. في عام 2017، بلغ عدد سكان مدينه جنين 48,479 نسمه بينما بلغ عدد سكان مخيم جنين للاجئين حوالي 10 الاف نسمه، حيث يسكنه عائلات من الفلسطينيين الذين فروا او طردوا من منازلهم خلال حرب فلسطين عام 1948، اما المحافظه فيقطنها حوالي 314,866 نسمه.\nتصل مساحه مدينه جنين وحدها الى 21,000 دونم، مما يجعلها خامس اكبر مدينه فلسطينيه في الضفه الغربيه بعد مدن الخليل ونابلس وطولكرم ويطا، بينما تبلغ مساحه محافظه جنين 583 كيلومترًا مربعًا اي 9,7% من مساحه الضفه الغربيه الاجماليه. يتبع المدينه مخيم جنين الذي يقع غربها ويسكنه 16,000 لاجئ. وترتفع المدينه عن سطح البحر بمعدل 175 متراً.\nعُرفت جنين بعدد من الاسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسم المدينه في مصادر واثار المصريين القدماء والبابليين والاشوريين، فوفقًا لعلماء الاثار فان الكنعانيين هم من اسسها في حدود سنه 2450 قبل الميلاد، وبهذا تعتبر من اقدم مدن العالم التي لا تزال ماهوله بالسكان. كانت تسمى قديمًا عين جانيم وتعني الجنائن، حيث ارتبط اسم المدينه بمرج بن عامر الذي يعتبر اخصب اراضي فلسطين التاريخيه، وفي عهد الرومان كان في بقعتها قريه ذكرت باسم «جيناي» من قرى سَبَسْطيه.\nسيطرت على جنين الكثير من القوى، فكانت تاره تنهض وتاره اخرى تنتكس، الا ان المدينه ازدهرت في اواخر الحكم العثماني وتاسس فيها اول مجلس بلدي في عام 1886. تطورت الحياه في جنين بصوره متسارعه عبر ما يزيد عن القرن بازدياد عدد اللاجئين اليها، حتى بلغت منزلتها المهمه بين المدن الكبرى بالضفه الغربيه في العصر الحديث.\nكان لمدينه جنين شان عظيم في النضال الوطني الفلسطيني منذ بدايه الصراع الفلسطيني الاسرائيلي، وظلت هاجسا بالنسبه لاسرائيل بسبب قربها من مدن الداخل ومشاركه عدد كبير من ابناءها في العمل المسلح ضد اسرائيل، خصوصا بعد الانتفاضه الثانيه.\n\nتسميه\nتقوم مدينه جنين على الارض التي كانت تقوم عليها مدينه «عين جنيم» وتعني بالكنعانيه عين الجنائن. لذلك سُميت بهذا الاسم بسبب الجنائن التي تحيط بها.\nذًُكرت مدينه «عين جنيم» في التوراه على انها احدى المدن التي سكنها اللاويون المنتمين لقبيله «اسحقكر»، والذين غيروا اسمها الى «جنّت» بعد بضع سنوات من استقرارهم بها. وفي كتابات اخرى يُرمز الى المدينه باسم «جيني»، ويذكر المؤرخ اليهودي «يوسيفوس فلافيوس» ان مدينه جنين كانت احدى مدن شمال السامره.\n\nتاريخ\nالعصور القديمه\nتوفرت في موقع جنين المظاهر الطبيعيه اللازمه لاي استقرار بشري، ففيه توفر الماء والسهل والجبل والاوديه والكهوف، وبالتالي وفر هذا الموقع الماء والغذاء والماوى والطريق. وعليه فليس من المستغرب ان يكون الانسان الاول قد اقام في هذا الموقع ولا سيما انه اكتشفت بقايا الانسان الاول في جبل الكرمل القريب من موقع جنين، وفي نفس الوقت ليس هناك ما يحول دون انتقال ذلك الانسان من جبل الكرمل الى جنين. وقبل الميلاد بقرون عديده كانت مدن بيت شان (بيسان) ومجدو ودوثان، وحتى تقوم بين هذه المدن علاقات تجاريه فلا بد من موقع وسطي يقوم بتقديم الخدمات للقوافل التجاريه، وانسب موقع في هذا المجال هو موقع مدينه جنين الذي بقع في وسط المثلث الذي شكله مواقع تلك المدن. ويعزز هذا الراي ورود اسم المدينه في النصوص المصريه القديمه وفي الوثائق البابليه والاشوريه. وقد ورد اسم المدينه في التوراه باسم «عين جنيم» او \"Eun Gannim\" (بالعبريه: ג'נין) اي عين الجنات لكثره مياهها وبساتينها، وكانت تعرف باسم «باب السامره» (سبسطيه الحاليه) لانها تقع عند بدايه الوادي الذي يصل بين مرج ابن عامر وجبال السامره. ونظراً لعدم حصانه موقع عين جانيم انشات في ذلك الوقت «مدينه بلعام» (بلعمه حالياً) التي تقع جنوب جنين ومشرفه على طريق السامره. والمعروف ان جنين الحاليه تقوم على المنطقه التي كانت تقوم عليها مدينه «عين جانيم» العربيه الكنعانيه.\n\nالعهد الفينيقي والاغريقي\nعُثر على 4 مشاعل مصنوعه من الطين النضيج في جنين، وهي ذات اصل فينيقي وتعود للقرن الثامن قبل الميلاد، وكان صاحب هذا الاكتشاف هو عالم الاثار «ج.ا. هاردينغ»، الذي قال بان هذا دليل على وجود نوع من التفاعل والعلاقات التجاريه بين سكان جنين وفينيقيا في ذلك الزمن.\n\nالعهد الروماني\nفي العهد الروماني كانت في مكانها قريه ذكرت باسم «جيناي»، وقد مر بالقرب منها المسيح اكثر من مره وهو في طريقه من الناصره الى القدس. وقد اعتنق سكانها المسيحيه، حيث عثر على بقايا كنيسه بالقرب من مركز جنين، في قريه برقين تحديداً، ويعود تاريخ هذه الكنيسه الى القرن السادس الميلادي. وقد غير الرومان اسمها من «عين جنيم» الى «جنين».\n\nالفتح الاسلامي والصليبيون\nولما جاء الفتح الاسلامي حُرّف اسمها الى «جينين»، وقد قال عنها ياقوت الحموي في معجم البلدان بانها «بليده حسنه بين نابلس وبيسان من ارض الاردن، بها عيون ومياه.» وتعاقبت على حكم المنطقه الدوله الامويه ثم العباسيه. وعندما انحطت هذه الاخيره اخذ يسيطر على فلسطين فئه خارجه عن القانون، مما سهّل على الصليبيين غزوها.\nسقطت مدينه جنين تحت الحكم الصليبي عام 1103م، وقد احتلها دوق ادنبره، ودخلت ضمن اماره بلدوين ومملكه بيت المقدس. وقد غير الصليبيون اسمها الى «غرين الكبرى» (بالفرنسيه: Grand Grin)، تمييزاً لها عن بلده زرعين التي دعوها باسم «غرين الصغرى» (بالفرنسيه: Petit Grin)، وقد احاطها الصليبيون بقلاع وحصون منيعه.\nبقيت جنين بيد الصليبيين حتى عام 1187م، حيث هاجمها صلاح الدين الايوبي اذ استطاع جنده ثقب قلعتها ولكن القلعه سقطت عليهم، وبالتالي غادرها صلاح الدين الى زرعين ومن ثم الى عين جالوت. وبعد معركه حطين سقطت جنين بيد المسلمين، وقد عقد صلاح الدين صلحاً مع اعدائه عام 588 هـ، وبالتالي تركها وغادر بعد ذلك الى بيسان.\nفي عام 1229 عُقد صلح بين فردريك الثاني - امبراطور الامبراطوريه الرومانيه المقدسه والكامل الايوبي خلال الحمله الصليبيه السادسه، اعطيت المدينه بموجبه الى الصليبيين ولكن الملك الصالح ايوب استطاع تحريرها نهائياً عام 1244م في معركه هربيا بمساعده الخوارزميه. وفي عام 1255م تم الاتفاق بين الناصر الايوبي وبين عز الدين ايبك، اول سلاطين المماليك، على اعطائه كل الاراضي التي تقع غرب نهر الاردن (فلسطين حالياً)، وبالتالي دخلت جنين في حوزه المماليك.\n\nالعهد المملوكي والعثماني\nلقد كانت جنين وزرعين احدى اقطاعيات الظاهر بيبرس، في عام 1260 شهدت منطقه عين جالوت الواقعه بالقرب من زرعين، شمال جنين واحده من المعارك الفاصله في التاريخ، حيث تعد معركه عين جالوت من اهم المعارك في تاريخ العالم الاسلامي، انتصر فيها المسلمون المماليك انتصارا ساحقا على المغول وكانت هذه هي المره الاولى التي يهزم فيها المغول في معركه حاسمه منذ عهد جنكيز خان. ادت المعركه لانحسار نفوذ المغول في بلاد الشام وخروجهم منها نهائيا وايقاف المد المغولي المكتسح الذي اسقط الخلافه العباسيه سنه 1258م. وفي عام 1280م ولّى السلطان قلاوون الامير بدر الدين درباس ولايه جنين ومرج ابن عامر. ومن ابرز حوادث جنين في العهد المملوكي، انتشار الوباء في مصر والشام عام 748هـ، ويعود تمكن الوباء من هذه المدينه لانفتاحها على البلدان الاخرى ولكثره الوافدين اليها حيث كانت جنين مركزاً من مراكز البريد بين غزه ودمشق. وقد حكم الامراء الحارثيون - الذين اعلنوا الولاء للعثمانيين - هذه البلاد. وكانت مدينه جنين مركزاً لزعامتهم (من 1601م الى 1671م) حيث خرجت الاماره منهم بعد هذا التاريخ وتولى الاماره احمد باشا الترزي ثم جاء بعده شيوخ المهاميط واشهرهم الشيخ علي من اواخر القرن السابع عشر حتى اوائل القرن الثامن عشر. وفي عام 1566م قامت فاطمه خاتون زوجه والي دمشق ببناء جامع اشتمل على حمام وتكيه وسوق (وهو جامع جنين الكبير حالياً) وقد بقي ال طرباي مسيطرين على المنطقه وموالين للعثمانيين الذين ساعدوهم ضد الامير فخر الدين المعني الثاني - حاكم لبنان - الذي فر الى اوروبا عام 1613م، ولكنه ما لبث ان عاد ثانيه الى المنطقه، وتمكن من هزيمه الطرباي الذين حكموا المنطقه عام 1624م. وفي عام 1660م الحقت جنين مع سنجق اللجون بولايه صيدا.\nفي عام 1799 هاجم الفرنسيون بقياده نابليون فلسطين وعسكر قائده كليبر في مرج ابن عامر، هنا هاجمه جنود الدوله العثمانيه بمساعده اهالي جنين ونابلس، الذين كادوا يقضون على الفرنسيين في تلك المنطقه، لولا ان هبّ نابليون لنجده كليبر، حيث قطع نابليون خط امدادات العثمانيين. ولما انتصر الفرنسيون امر نابليون جنده بحرق جنين ونهبها انتقاماً منهم لمساعدتهم للعثمانيين. وبعد اندحار الفرنسيين ورجوعهم الى مصر نمت مدينه جنين ثانيه واصبحت مركزاً لمتسلميه جنين، يحكمها متسلم ينوب عن والي صيدا وكانت في الغالب لعائلتي ال جرار وال عبد الهادي.\nوكان جبل نابلس في هذه الفتره ينقسم الى متسلميتين: الاولى «متسلميه اللجون» والتي انتقلت فيما بعد الى جنين والثانيه «متسلميه نابلس» واللتان تقعان ضمن سنجق البلقاء (نابلس) التابع لولايه بيروت العثمانيه. وكان ال جرار امراء متسلميه اللجون منذ اوائل القرن الثامن عشر، ففي نهايه هذا القرن قامت الدوله العثمانيه بتعيين الشيخ يوسف الجرار اميراً على اللجون في بلاد حارثه، والذي قام وبمساعده سكان المنطقه والعثمانيين بنجده احمد باشا الجزار حاكم عكا في التصدي للغزو الفرنسي على المدينه.\nثم دخلت جنين كباقي مدن الشام تحت الحكم المصري بعد ان نجح ابراهيم باشا في طرد العثمانيين، وعين حسين عبد الهادي حاكماً لها، كما جعلها مركز لواء خاصاً به، الا ان حكم المصريين لم يدم طويلاً حيث اضطر المصريون للخروج من بلاد الشام عام 1840م. فعادت جنين قائمقاميه في متصرفيه نابلس التابعه لولايه بيروت التي انشئت بدلاً من ولايه صيدا. وفي القرن العشرين ربطت جنين بسكه حديد الحجاز التي وصلتها بالعفوله وبيسان ونابلس، وفي الحرب العالميه الاولى اقام الجيش الالماني مطاراً عسكرياً غرب جنين.\n\nالتاريخ المعاصر\nالانتداب البريطاني\nفي عهد الانتداب البريطاني اصبحت المدينه مركزاً لقضاء جنين، ولها سجل حافل بالنضال ضد الاستعمار البريطاني والصهيوني، حيث اعلنت اول قوه مسلحه ضد الاستعمار البريطاني عام 1935م بقياده عز الدين القسام، والذي استشهد لاحقاً في احراش بلده يعبد وهي احد البلدات التي تقع غرب مدينه جنين. وقد اشترك سكان المدينه في اضراب عام 1936، وقد تعرضت جنين ابان فتره الانتداب البريطاني الى الكثير من اعمال العنف والتنكيل والتخريب وهدم البيوت على ايدي القوات البريطانيه نتيجه لبعض الحوادث مثل قتل حاكم جنين «موفيت» في عام 1938.\n\nقيام دوله اسرائيل\nاما بعد انسحاب البريطانيين من فلسطين منتصف 1948، وفي خضم [[حرب فلسطين\n1948|الحرب العربيه-الاسرائيليه الاولى]] او النكبه، اختير القائد عبد القادر الحسيني لتولي القياده العسكريه في جبل القدس. ولما تاخر وصول كتاب جيش الانقاذ من الدول العربيه المجاوره حتى اواخر شهر كانون الثاني سنه 1948، قرر الحسيني تعبئه القوى الشعبيه في القسم العربي من التقسيم وقد كان يعتمد على متطوعي جبل نابلس لتاريخ هذا الجبل البطولي والعسكري، ولذا فقد وفد الى مدينه جنين مطلع شهر كانون الثاني وبعد مناقشات ومحادثات مع وجهاء المنطقه، عقدت عده اجتماعات في قرى القضاء وتطوع عدد كبير من المقاتلين واختار الجمع الشيخ فوزي الجرار قائداً لجميع فرق مقاتلي جبل نابلس. وقد اقرت الهيئه العربيه العليا والقياده العسكريه العليا لجامعه الدول العربيه هذا التعيين واعتمدته واوصت ان يتخذ جرار مراكزه في قرى صانور، صير وجبع.\nولقد خاضت جنين بمدنها وقراها معركه الدفاع عن الوجود ضد المنظمات الصهيونيه المسلحه، التي استولت في اواخر مايو سنه 1948 على قرى زرعين، والمزار، ونورس، وصندله، والجلمه، والمقيبله، وفقوعه، وعرانه، وحاولت الاستيلاء على مدينه جنين حيث تم تطويقها في 3 يونيو 1948 وكان عدد الصهاينه 4000 مقاتل؛ فاستولوا على معظم احياء المدينه وتحصن المجاهدون في عماره الشرطه في المدخل الغربي لجنين. حتى وصلت نجده للمحاصرين قوامها 500 جندي عراقي بقياده عمر علي وحوالي 800 من المجاهدين الفلسطينيين من المدينه. وبعد معارك داميه خارج البلده وفي شوارعها وازقتها شارك فيها العديد من سكان المنطقه وقراها المجاوره تقدم العرب لاسترداد قراهم المحيطه بالمدينه. وقد كانت معركه جنين التي وقعت في 3 حزيران سنه 1948 مفخره للمقاتلين من اهل البلاد الذين استشهد منهم العشرات بالاضافه للعدد الكبير من الجرحى، والتي ادت في اخر المطاف الى انسحاب القوات الاسرائيليه من جنين في 4 حزيران سنه 1948 وتكبيدها خسائر جسيمه بلغت 1241 قتيل ومفقود من اصل 4000 جندي اسرائيلي كانوا يحاصرون المدينه. يستذكر الفلسطينيون شهداء الجيش العراقي الذين سقطوا دفاعاً عن جنين، حيث توجد مقبره للعشرات منهم بالقرب من مثلث الشهداء جنوب المدينه.\n\nقيام السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه\nومع باقي الضفه الغربيه دخلت المدينه في عام 1951 في اتحاد مع المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه، واصبحت في عام 1964 مركزاً للواء جنين التابع لمحافظه نابلس. وبقيت تحت الحكم الاردني حتى احتلالها في حرب 1967 او النكسه. رزحت جنين تحت الاحتلال الاسرائيلي واصبحت مركزاً لمنطقه جنين التي يحكمها حاكم عسكري اسرائيلي مباشره. استمر هذا الوضع حتى قدوم السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه عام 1995، واصبحت المدينه منذ ذلك الحين، مركزاً لمحافظه جنين، كما وقعت معظم اراضي المحافظه ضمن تصنيف (ا) و (ب) حسب اتفاق اوسلو.\nفي 3 نيسان من سنه 2002 قامت القوات الاسرائيليه باقتحام جنين ومخيمها في عمليه استمرت 10 ايام متواصله، ارتكبت فيها اسرائيل مجزره راح ضحيتها 58 فلسطيني، فيما تكبدت هي خسائر جسيمه باعداد القتلى حيث ناهزت العشرين قتيل من الجنود الاسرائيليين الذي اشتبكوا في حرب شوارع مع فصائل المقاومه داخل مخيم المدينه في ما اطلق عليها لاحقاً معركه جنين.\n\nحرب غزه (2023)\nخلال حرب غزه، نفذت قوات الاحتلال الاسرائيليه عمليات متعدده في جنين. وفي 22 اكتوبر/تشرين الاول، نفذت القوات الاسرائيليه غاره جويه استهدفت مجمعًا تحت الارض اسفل مسجد الانصار في مخيم جنين للاجئين\nبالمدينه +، ما ادى لاستشهاد اثنين واصيب اخرين بجروح متفاوته، وقيل انها كانت اول غاره جويه في الضفه الغربيه منذ الانتفاضه الثانيه. وادعى الجيش الاسرائيلي ان الضربه استهدفت نشطاء من حماس والجهاد الاسلامي في فلسطين كانوا يخططون ل\"هجوم ارهابي\".\nوتعرضت جنين لاضرار بالغه خلال الحرب على غزه، وبحلول يونيو 2024، ادت الهجمات المتكرره بالقنابل والتوغلات بالجرافات من قبل القوات الاسرائيليه الى تدمير كل شارع وتحويل كل ساحه عامه الى انقاض. وفي حادثه واحده في 21 مايو، وفقًا للصحفي الاسرائيلي جدعون ليفي، اطلق قناص اسرائيلي النار على الماره ما ادى لاستشهادهم، بما في ذلك جراح الدكتور اسيد جبارين (50 عامًا) اثناء توجهه الى العمل في مستشفى جنين الحكومي.\n\nالاهميه الدينيه\nورد اسم جنين بالمخطوطات المصريه القديمه، وكذلك البابليه والاشوريه وفي التوراه والانجيل، وهي مشتقه من الاسم القديم «عين جهانيم» او «جنيم» وهي قريبه من الجنائن والبساتين. وتعتبر جنين خامس الاماكن المقدسه عند المسيحيين، لمرور يسوع المسيح من قريه برقين، حيث اشفى العشره البرص المنعزلين في مغاره بطرف القريه.\nوفي المكان نفسه وفي اوائل القرن الرابع الميلادي اقام قسطنطين الكبير كنيسه برقين المعروفه بكنيسه جرجس وقد قامت الحكومه الهولنديه باجراء الاصلاحات اللازمه لها بالتنسيق مع دائره الاثار في السلطه الوطنيه الفلسطينيه باعتبارها من الاماكن المقدسه لدى النصارى، واصبحت هذه الكنيسه تعتبر طريق الوصل للحجاج المسيحيين من الناصره الى بيت لحم. وفي الفتره المشار اليها اقيمت في جنين كنيسه من ضمن 31 مدينه و442 قريه في عموم اراضي فلسطين، وظلت الكنيسه قائمه الى ان دمرها زلزال عام 560م. كما تضم المحافظه ديراً للاتين يقع في قريه الزبابده ذات الاغلبيه المسيحيه، الواقعه جنوب شرق جنين.\nاما اسلامياً، فيقع في المدينه واحد من اقدم واكبر المعالم الاسلاميه العثمانيه في فلسطين وهو جامع جنين الكبير الذي انشاته فاطمه خاتون ابنه محمد بك بن السلطان الملك الاشرف قانصوه الغوري في القرن السادس عشر. ويُعتبر هذا المسجد من ابرز المعالم التاريخيه في الحضاره الاسلاميه في فلسطين، ومن اقدم التحف المعماريه العثمانيه في البلاد.\n\nالجغرافيه\nالموقع\nتقع مدينه جنين على دائره عرض 32,28 شمالاً وعلى خط طول 35,18 شرق غرينتش، كما تقع على الاحداثيات 208 عرض و178 طول حسب شبكه الاحداثيات الفلسطينيه.\nينقطع في الاجزاء الشماليه من فلسطين استمرار الاقليم الجبلي المحاذي للسهول الساحليه مكوناً سهلاً يشبه مثلثاً متساوي الاضلاع، تمتد قاعدته من سفوح جبل الكرمل في حيفا حتى شرق جنين، ويمتد الضلع الاول من جنوب شرق الناصره وينتهي في جوار مدينه جنين، ويمتد الضلع الثاني بمحاذاه جبال الجليل. ويطلق على السهل اسم مرج ابن عامر. وبالتالي، يمثل موقع مدينه جنين راس مثلث سهل مرج ابن عامر، عند التقاء المرتفعات الممتده من جبل الكرمل ومن جنوب شرق الناصره.\nومما يعطي موقع مدينه جنين اهميه انها تقع في موقع وسطي بالنسبه للمدن الفلسطينيه، حيث تقع جنوب مدينه الناصره على بعد 25 كم، والى الجنوب الشرقي من مدينه حيفا على بعد 50 كم، والى الشمال من مدينه نابلس على بعد 43 كم.\nتقع المدينه على السفح الشمالي لجبال نابلس على الجانب المطل على مرج بن عامر، وتنتشر مساكن المدينه على هذا السفح من ارتفاع يناهز 125م الى ارتفاع يقارب 225م. ويتراوح انحدار هذا السفح بين 10-15 %، مما يشير الى تدرج السفح بشكل تدريجي. وعند قمه السفح تقوم هضبه فسيحه ترتفع تدريجياً نحو الشرق، وتطل باتجاه الشمال على مرج ابن عامر ومن الجنوب الغربي تطل على سهل عرابه الذي يرتفع قرابه 250م، وبالتالي يظهر السفح الذي تقوم عليه المدينه، عتبه بين سهل مرج ابن عامر وبين سهل عرابه.\n\nقرى جنين\nفي محافظه جنين مدينتان، مدينه جنين وقباطيه، ويتبع المحافظه 14 بلديه كبيره (هي يعبد، عرابه، برقين، صانور، سيله الحارثيه، سيله الظهر، الزبابده، اليامون، كفر راعي، كفر دان، ميثلون، دير ابو ضعيف، جبع، عجه، صير)، كما ينتشر عدد ليس بقليل من القرى ومخيم يقع الى الغرب من المدينه، والذي تعرض للاجتياح الاسرائيلي في شهر نيسان عام 2002. كانت جنين تضم قبل نكبه 1948 حوالي (70) قريه كبيره وصغيره وبعد النكبه اقتصرت على ما يقارب 30 قريه صغيره. ومثل باقي المدن الفلسطينيه، تعرضت اراضي شاسعه من جنين وقراها للمصادره من قبل اسرائيل، حيث اقام على ارضها ما يزيد عن 10 مستوطنات.\n\nالمناخ\nيختلف مناخ منطقه جنين عن المناخ العام لفلسطين، وذلك لوضعها الطبوغرافي. فتقع المدينه على ارتفاع يتراوح بين 125 و225 متر، كما تحاط بعدد من المرتفعات، فمن الشرق تحيط بها جبال جلبون ومن الجنوب والغرب والشمال الغربي تحيط بها جبال نابلس وامتدادها في جبل الكرمل، وان انفتاحها على مرج ابن عامر تقفله جبال الجليل على بعد لا يتجاوز 20 كم. هذا الوضع قلل من استفاده المدينه من الرياح الغربيه والجنوبيه الغربيه الماطره والمعدله لدرجه الحراره، كما عمل على ابعاد مناخ جنين عن مناخ البحر الابيض المتوسط، وجعلته اكثر تطرفاً. مثلاً، تتلقى منطقه جنين كميه من الامطار اقل من كميه الامطار التي تتلقاها منطقه يعبد المجاوره بمئه وخمسين مليمترا، وحرارتها اعلى من حراره المنطقه المجاوره.\n\nالسكان\nان نمو عدد السكان في جنين لم يكن بمعدل كبير في الفتره الممتده بين عاميّ 1922 و1931، وذلك بسبب هجره العديد من سكانها الى مدن السهل الساحلي، الا ان هذا النمو بدا يرتفع فيما بعد ليتضاعف عام 1947م؛ بسبب عوده سكان المدينه اليها، وبفعل الركود الاقتصادي الذي اصاب المناطق الساحليه، وبحكم الحرب العالميه الثانيه والاحداث الجاريه في المنطقه. وفي عام 1952 سجل تعداد سكان جنين ارتفاعاً كبيراً بعد تدفق اعداد كبيره من اللاجئين الفلسطينيين عقب نكبه العام 1948، وعاد لينخفض انخفاضاً حاداً عام 1967 بسبب نزوح اعداد كبيره من سكان المدينه الى شرق الاردن ودول الخليج في اعقاب نكسه عام 1967. وفي سنه 1980 عاد عدد السكان للارتفاع بسبب عوده سكان المدينه اليها وما زال يواصل ارتفاعه حتى الان.\nوفقاً لاحصاء عام 2007، فقد بلغ عدد سكان مدينه جنين 39,000 نسمه، من بينهم 19,238 اناث و 19,766 ذكور. كما يبلغ عدد سكان مخيم جنين الذي يقع غرب المدينه 16,000 لاجئ، حسب احصائيات وكاله غوث وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (الاونروا) والتي اشارت الى ان 42.3% من سكان المخيم هم دون سن الخمسه عشر عام، وهذا يعني ان النسبه الكبرى من سكان جنين ومخيمها من الشباب. اما بالنسبه للعدد الاجمالي لسكان محافظه جنين فقد بلغ في عام 2007 حوالي 256,000 نسمه، وهو ما يشكل نسبه 6,8% من تعداد الشعب الفلسطيني داخل الاراضي الفلسطينيه. يُشكل مسلم الغالبيه العظمى من السكان كباقي مناطق الاراضي الفلسطينيه، وتتواجد اقليه المسيحيه في اسرائيل تنتشر في بعض قرى المحافظه وفي جنين نفسها. وهذا جدول باعداد سكان منطقه جنين في سنوات مختلفه:\n\nمخيم جنين\nاسست وكاله الامم المتحده لاغاثه وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (UNRWA) مخيمَ اللاجئين عام 1953 برعايه اردنيه. ويقع المخيم غرب مركز المدينه، ويمتد على مساحه ضيقه لا تتجاوز الكيلومتر المربع، ويعيش فيه كما ذُكر ما يقارب 16,000 لاجئ، مما يجعله بقعه مكتظه سكانياً، وهو امر غير صحي وخصوصًا في ظل النقص الحاد في الخدمات الاساسيه.\n\nكان مخيم جنين هدفا استراتيجيا لقوات الاحتلال الاسرائيلي حيث حاولت استهدافه مرات عده، لكنها فشلت امام مقاومه ابنائه، حيث وجدت قوات الاحتلال صموداً من سكانه الذين اصروا على البقاء داخل المخيم رغم الاضرار الكبيره التي تعرضوا لها، وبلغت الاعتداءات الاسرائيليه على المخيم ذروتها فجر 3 نيسان سنه 2002 حين اقتحمت المخيم واشتبكت مع فصائل المقاومه بحرب شوارع اطلق عليها لاحقاً معركه جنين.\n\nالمواصلات\nكان لموقع جنين اكبر الاثر في حياه المدينه قديماً وحديثاً، ويظهر ذلك في تاريخها الاقتصادي والاجتماعي، وفي اهميتها كعقده مواصلات بين جبال فلسطين الوسطى (نابلس - القدس - الخليل) ومدنها، وبين شمال فلسطين لا سيما طريق القدس - الناصره. كما تتفرع من المدينه طرق الى حيفا وعكا. وقد حظيت مدينه جنين باهتمام بالغ من حيث المواصلات، حيث عُبدت الطرق اليها قبل الطرق الساحليه التي كانت تعتبر اهم الطرق بالنسبه للمستعمرين ايام الانتداب البريطاني على فلسطين. ولم تتوقف اهميه المدينه على الطرق البريه، بل امتدت اهميتها الى الخطوط الحديديه، حيث يمر بها خط يصل الى العفوله ومن ثم بيسان فطبريا.\nتعدّ مدينه جنين من المدن الفلسطينيه التي نشات قديمِاً وتطورت عمرانيًا وذلك نتيجه للتزايد السكاني، ولكن لم تتطور شبكه المواصلات فيها بشكل مواز، ويعود ذلك لفترات الاحتلال المتعاقبه والتي مرت بها المدينه، والظروف الاقتصاديه والاجتماعيه الناجمه، مما ادى الى ظهور العديد من المشاكل في نظاِم المواصلات سواءً على مستوى تخطيط وتنظيم الطرقات والشوارع، او على مستوى البنيه الانشائيه للطرق.\n\nتاتي اهميه مدينه جنين من حيث نوع الخدمات التي تقدمها والمؤسسات الموجودهِ فيها، والتي تتضمن مكاتب حكوميه ومدارس، ومستشفيات، وبنوك، واسواق، ومحلات تجاريه ومنطقه صناعيه، والتي تقدم خدمات للقرى والبلدات في المحافظه. اضافه لذلك، فان اهميه المدينه تعود الى الطرق الاقليميه والتي تم تخطيطها من قبل وزاره التخطيط والتي تمر عبر مدينه جنين، فالطريق الاولى من وادي الاردن الى الناصره، والاخرى تربط الخليل بحيفا وتمر عبر مدينتي نابلس ورام الله، وتاتي اهميه المدينه ايضا بسبب قربها من الخط الاخضر الوهمي الذي يفصل مناطق عام 1948 عن المناطق المحتله عام 1967، حيث تشكل مركزا للتسوق للفلسطينيين داخل الخط الاخضر.\nوتزداد اهميه النقل في مدينه جنين وذلك نتيجه للتوسع المدينه ونموها المتسارع. ويستخدم سكان المدينه في تنقلهم داخل المدينه وسائل نقل مختلفه. الا انه تبين من المسح الميداني عام 2007، ان هناك انخفاض في استخدام السيارات الخاصه في المدينه، حيث بلغت نسبه الاسر التي تمتلك سياره خاصه 13.8% من مجموع الاسر بالمدينه. في مقابل ذلك يلاحظ ارتفاع في استخدام سيارات الاجره وخاصه للتنقل بين مركز المدينه ومناطقها المختلفه، حيث بلغت نسبه مستخدمي هذه الوسيله 43.9%، وبنسبه اقل للحافلات تبلغ 25.3% من مجموع السكان.\nتتكون الشبكه الحاليه للطرق في مدينه جنين من مجموعه من الممرات الرئيسيه، التي يتراوح عرضها من اربع مسارب الى مسربين، تربط اجزاء المدينه ببعضها، كما تربطها بمدن فلسطينيه اخرى، بالاضافه لقرى محافظه جنين، وهذه الطرق هي:\n\nالاقتصاد\nمدينه جنين احدى المدن الرئيسيه في فلسطين، بالرغم من قله عدد سكانها تاريخياً حتى النكبه، مقارنه بالمدن الفلسطينيه الاخرى، الا ان لها ثقلاً اقتصادياً يفوق حجمها السكاني بشده، وهذا يعود لتمتع المحافظه بخصائص طبيعيه متنوعه وفرت لها موارد اقتصاديه متنوعه لا سيما في مجال التعليم والخدمات والمهن والحرف، مما مكن ابناءها من ايجاد فرص عمل في الدول العربيه المجاوره، وهذا بدوره خفض من اثر المدينه بالمساهمه الفعاله بالحجم السكاني في الضفه الغربيه، ولكنه اتاح الفرصه لرفع معدلات حوالات المغتربين للمدينه والمحافظه بشكل كبير مما اثر على اقتصاد المدينه والبلاد بشكل ايجابي. تدير غرفه تجاره وصناعه وزراعه لواء جنين الاوضاع الاقتصاديه في المدينه.\n\nالتجاره\nوتنتشر الاسواق في مدينه جنين: فهناك السوق الشعبي، سوق الحلال، سوق الجمله، سوق السيباط، سوق شارع الناصره، سوق شارع ابو بكر، سوق شارع بورسعيد، سوق شارع فيصل، سوق شارع الهلال، سوق شارع فاطمه خاتون، وسوق الحسبه القديمه. وتحتوي الاسواق المذكوره على العديد من المحلات التجاريه المختلفه. بالاضافه الى سوق تجاري رئيس يقع وسط المدينه واخر يقع شمال المدينه مخصص لاستقبال المتسوقين الفلسطينيين داخل الخط الاخضر الذين يشكلون 85% من القوه الشرائيه حسب تقديرات الغرفه التجاريه والصناعيه في جنين.\n\nالزراعه\nتعتبر الزراعه نشاطاً رئيسياً في مدينه جنين ومحافظتها، حيث يعتمد عليها غالبيه السكان سواء كان ذلك بصوره مباشره او غير مباشره. وقبل هجره بعض سكانها الى دول الخليج في ستينات القرن العشرين، كانت الزراعه هي المورد الوحيد في المنطقه. وتعد مدينه جنين زراعيه لحد كبير اذ تشكل مركز التسويق والتمويل الزراعي للمحافظه، حيث تعد اراضيها الزراعيه واحده من اكثر المناطق خصوبه في الضفه الغربيه، حيث تزرع سنوياً بالمحاصيل الحقليه والخضار والاشجار المثمره كالزيتون واللوزيات والحمضيات، بالاضافه الى استخدام البيوت البلاستيكيه على نطاق واسع. كما تشتهر المحافظه منذ عقود بزراعه فاكهه البطيخ بشكل لافت. قدرت وزاره الزراعه الفلسطينيه مساحه الارض المزروعه في المحافظه عام 1998/1997، حوالي 367,415 دونم وهو ما يعادل حوالي 20% من مساحه الارض المزروعه في الاراضي الفلسطينيه.\nتتمتع منطقه جنين وطوباس بثروه حرجيه تميزها على باقي محافظات السلطه الفلسطينيه، وتنتشر الغابات على مساحه تقارب 270,000 دونم، تشكل حوالي 85% من احراش الضفه الغربيه، الا انها تقع في الغالب في التصنيف (ج) حسب اتفاق اوسلو.\n\nالصناعه\nبدا اقتصاد المدينه يتحول تدريجياً الى الصناعه بعد قدوم السلطه الفلسطينيه في منتصف تسعينات القرن الفائت، وبالاخص الصناعات الخفيفه والمتوسطه، حيث ستنشا منطقه صناعيه دوليه من اجل تفعيل الحركه الاقتصاديه وتنشيطها، وايجاد فرص عمل لعدد كبير من اهالي المنطقه، وجعل جنين همزه وصل بين عرب الداخل وباقي مناطق السلطه الفلسطينيه. ويمكن اجمال هذه الصناعات بالتالي: صناعات زراعيه، وتشمل معاصر الزيتون والمطاحن؛ وصناعات خاصه بالبناء وتشمل المقالع والمحاجر والكسارات وصناعه البلاط والفسيفساء؛ وصناعه الملابس والاحذيه والخشب والحديد.\nفي عام 2008، افتتح مهرجان للصناعات الوطنيه الفلسطينيه في القريه السياحيه شرق جنين، برعايه السلطه الفلسطينيه وبدعم اوروبي، وكان لذلك شان كبير في تقدم المشاريع الاقتصاديه وتحقيق النمو الاقتصادي في المحافظه والاراضي الفلسطينيه بصوره عامه.\n\nالعماره\nتعتبر مدينه جنين مدينه سكنيه الى حد كبير، بالاضافه لكونها مركز تجاري وزراعي، الا ان طابع المنازل والبنايات السكنيه يغلب عليها، ويختلف حجم البناء ومساحه المساكن بالنسبه للمدينه عنه في المدن الفلسطينيه الاخرى، فبلغ متوسط عدد الغرف فيها 4.5 غرفه لعام 2007، بينما المعدل العام في المدن الفلسطينيه هو 3.6 غرفه، وقد يعود هذا الى عدد من العوامل منها العادات والتقاليد، حيث ان البناء حجمه وشكله ومادته كلها تعزز القيمه الاجتماعيه للاسره. ويظهر ذلك بوضوح عند الذين تركوا الارياف ثم انتقلوا الى السكن في مدينه جنين، كما للدخل دور في عدد الغرف بالمسكن.\nوتتوفر في محافظه جنين مناطق متعدده يتم استخراج حجاره البناء منها ومن هذه المناطق قباطيا وعجه وغيرها، مما دفع الكثير من السكان لاستخدام الحجاره في بناء مساكنهم بنسبه عاليه. ويستخدم الطوب ايضا بنسبه كبيره - خاصه بمخيم المدينه، كما تستخدم الدكه والطين بنسب اقل. ان نسبه المساكن المبنيه من الحجر بلغت 40.5% من مساكن المدينه، وهي نسبه مقاربه للنسبه العامه لمدن الضفه الغربيه والتي هي 40% حسب احصاء سنه 1997.\n\nالتعليم\nتحتل محافظه جنين مرتبه متقدمه في نسب التعليم بالاراضي الفلسطينيه، وهي الاولى على مستوى الضفه الغربيه، حيث تشاطر النسبه ذاتها تقريباً كل من سلفيت وطولكرم - وتبلغ نسبه الاميه في محافظه جنين 3,9% من الذين هم اكبر من 10 سنوات، بينما المعدل العام في الاراضي الفلسطينيه هو 5,8% (وهو كما معروف من اقل النسب عربياً).\nعرفت المدينه حركه تعليميه منذ امد بعيد، حيث كان نظام (الكتاتيب) سائداً منذ بدايه القرن التاسع عشر. وقد شهدت مساجد المدينه الحلقات التدريسيه والمناظرات العلميه من قبل مشاهير العلماء المسلمين، وغلب على هذه الحركه العلميه الطابع الديني حيث كانت تدرس علوم الدين المختلفه من فقه وحديث.\nوفي نهايه القرن التاسع عشر اقيمت اول مدرسه ابتدائيه ضمت اربعه صفوف، ثم تبع انشاء المدرسه الابتدائيه اخرى علياً. وبقي الامر كذلك حتى بعد الانتداب البريطاني، لان البريطانيين لم يكونوا معنيين بتطور الخدمات العامه لا سيما الخدمات التعليميه. وفي عام 1943 ارتفعت معدلات التضخم في البلاد بشكل حاد، وهذا دفع الاستعمار البريطاني للقيام ببعض الخدمات لامتصاص الفائض النقدي في البلاد، فانشا في مدينه جنين مدرسه ثانويه، دفع الاهالي تكاليفها بالكامل. ومن الامور التي ساهمت فعلاً في تطوير الحركه العلميه في المدينه تشكيل لجنه المعارف المحليه التي كانت مهمتها البحث في الموارد والمصادر الماليه التي يمكن عن طريقها تطوير التعليم في المدينه.\n\nوبعد حرب سنه 1948 لم يكن في المدينه سوى مدرستين، واحده للذكور واخرى للاناث. وبعد تولي الحكومه الاردنيه زاد عدد المدارس وتضاعف عدد الطلاب.\nوفي عام 1982 بلغ عدد المدارس في مدينه جنين احدى عشره مدرسه للذكور وست مدراس للاناث، وبلغ عدد الطلاب في هذه السنه 2610 طالباً و2495 طالبه ومما تجدر الاشاره اليه هو ان عدد الطلاب الذكور في هذه السنه لم يتجاوز عدد الطلاب عام 1960. هذا يشير الى ظاهره الهجره من المدينه في الفتره التي تلت حرب سنه 1967، اما من حيث الطالبات فقد تضاعف عددهن تقريباً بين هاتين السنتين.\nانشات الحكومه الاردنيه في عام 1965 مديريه التربيه والتعليم في جنين لتشرف على 65 مدرسه موزعه بين الذكور والاناث في التجمعات السكانيه المختلفه التابعه للواء جنين انذاك ويعمل بها 508 معلمه ومعلم. في عام 2005 بلغ عدد المدارس التابعه للمديريه 110 مدارس، وعدد الطلبه 37,531 طالب وطالبه وعدد المعلمين 1,852 معلم ومعلمه.\nاما على صعيد التعليم العالي، فقد شهدت جنين طفرهً كبيرهً في اعداد حَمَله شهادات البكالوريوس والماجستير في كثير من التخصصات سواء في الضفه الغربيه او في الخارج. ويتبع تنظيم محافظه جنين اليوم جامعه خاصه هي الجامعه العربيه الامريكيه - جنين وفرع لجامعه القدس المفتوحه، والتي لا تقتصر خدماتها التعليميه على سكان محافظه جنين فقط، بل تمتد هذه الخدمات لتشمل القرى وبعض المدن المحيطه بها.\n\nالثقافه\nشكلت الثقافه جزءً من هويه سكان منطقه جنين منذ زمن بعيد، والتي كانت في الاغلب ثقافه تعبر عن الريف الفلسطيني، وهذا يظهر بشكل واضح في اللكنه او اللهجه التي تميز سكان هذه المنطقه عن باقي اللهجات الفلسطينيه بقلب القاف الى كاف، كذلك هو الحال بالنسبه للزي التقليدي الذي تميز في منطقه جنين وشمال الضفه الغربيه عن غيره من الازياء الفلسطينيه الاخرى ببساطته ولونه الابيض المقلم طولياً. كذلك يظهر التاثير الريفي في المطبخ الفلسطيني لهذا الجزء من فلسطين والذي يشتهر بطبق المسخن الشعبي، الذي يعتبر في نفس الوقت من الاكلات الوطنيه في المطبخ الفلسطيني.\nتحوي جنين وقراها عدداً كبيراً من المعالم الثقافيه البارزه على مستوى الضفه الغربيه، لكنها في الغالب اما ان تكون قد عانت او تضررت بسبب الاحتلال الاسرائيلي. فقد تم في عام 2009 العمل على اعاده ترميم وتاهيل سينما جنين بدعم الماني -والتي كانت تعتبر من اكبر صالات العرض في الضفه الغربيه- بعد اغلاقها مده تزيد عن 22 عاماً، اي بعد الانتفاضه الاولى مباشره.\nبموازاه ذلك يوجد في مخيم جنين مسرح هو مسرح الحريه. يعتبر مسرح الحريه الاول في المنطقه والوحيد، تاسس عام 1990. يعمل المسرح على عقد ورش عمل مختلفه في مجالي الدراما وموسيقى الاطفال والشباب، حيث يقوم كادر العمل المسرحي بتدريب استشاريين من الشباب للعمل مع المشاركين من مخيم جنين. يوفر المسرح ايضاً دورات في العلاج من خلال التمثيل المسرحي. وتجدر الاشاره الى انه يقام في محافظه جنين كل عام مهرجان ثقافي هو مهرجان مرج ابن عامر للتراث والثقافه والذي يعكس الوجه الحضاري والثقافي للمحافظه والضفه الغربيه بشكل عام.\nوفي جنين ايضاً مركزاً للثقافه والابداع اُسّس عام 2005، ومعهد جنين للموسيقى يضم اوركسترا جنين للشباب، ومتحف جنين للتراث الشعبي يحاكي تاريخ فلسطين ويعتبر الاول من نوعه في البلاد، وهو يجسد جانبا من تاريخ فلسطين منذ العهده العمريه وحتى عوده الرئيس ياسر عرفات الى فلسطين، ويقع في القريه السياحيه جنوب شرق المدينه.\n\nالاعلام\nتوجد في جنين محطتان محليتان للبث الارضي هما تلفزيون جنين المركزي وتلفزيون فرح، كما تبث محطتان اذاعيتان من المدينه على موجه (اف ام) هما: راديو البلد - جنين وصوت الاحلام، يغطي بثيهما معظم مناطق شمال الضفه الغربيه.\n\nالبنيه التحتيه\nتحوي المدينه عدداً قليلاً من المنشات الكبيره في المجالات الخدميه والاجتماعيه والصحيه، فتوجد بعض المستشفيات الصغيره والعيادات بالاضافه الى مستشفى جنين الحكومي ومستشفى الشفاء. اما بالنسبه للجانب الرياضي، فيوجد في جنين ملعب يتبع البلديه ويتسع لثلاثه الاف متفرج، يلعب فيه نادي جنين الرياضي الذي يلعب في الدوري الفلسطيني الممتاز، اضافه الى عده فرق تنتشر في قرى المحافظه. وتوجد في المدينه العديد من المكتبات اهمها مكتبه البلديه القديمه وسط المدينه.\n\nبلديه جنين\nتم انشاء اول بلديه في مدينه جنين عام 1886 برئاسه الحاج عبد المجيد منصور حيث كان عدد الناخبين لا يتجاوز الثمانين ناخباً من بينهم سته اعضاء بطريقه الاقتراع السري، بحيث يعين المتصرف الرئيسي من بين الاعضاء المنتخبين لمده اربع سنوات. وقد بقي التشريع التركي هذا معمولاً به الى ان صدر القانون رقم 17 لسنه 1954م. وظل الوضع كما هو الى ان قامت السلطات الاسرائيليه باقاله اخر مجلس منتخب سنه 1982 والذي كان برئاسه احمد شوقي موسى المحمود، وتسلمت اسرائيل اداره البلديه حتى عام 1995 حيث تشكلت لجنه وطنيه برئاسه وليد ابو مويس، وقد تسلم رئاستها بقرار رئاسي من الرئيس ياسر عرفات في تشرين الاول من سنه 1995، اي بعد تاسيس السلطه الفلسطينيه. وتتبع بلديه جنين اليوم 14 بلديه وحوالي 30 قريه في المحافظه.\n\nقائمه رؤساء بلديه جنين\nتوالى على رئاسه بلديه جنين 18 شخصًا هم:\n\nانظر ايضًا\nمعركه جنين\nفيلم جنين\nاجتياح جنين (2023)\n\nمراجع\nقراءات اخرى\nوصلات خارجيه\n\nمعلومات عن جنين من صفحه مكتب تنسيق الشؤون الانسانيه

      "summary": "جِنِين مدينة فلسطينية، ومركز محافظة جنين وأكبر مدنها، تقع في شمال الضفة الغربية المحتلة التابعة للسلطة الفلسطينية. تعتبر تاريخيًا، إحدى مدن المثلث في شمال فلسطين، وتبعد عن القدس مسافة 75 كيلومترًا إلى الشمال. تطل جنين على غور الأردن من ناحية الشرق، ومرج بن عامر إلى جهة الشمال.\nبالرغم من قلة عدد سكانها حتى تاريخ وقوع النكبة مقارنة بالمدن الفلسطينية الأخرى، إلا أن لها ثقلا اقتصاديا أكبر بكثير من حجمها السكاني. في عام 2017، بلغ عدد سكان مدينة جنين 48,479 نسمة بينما بلغ عدد سكان مخيم جنين للاجئين حوالي 10 آلاف نسمة، حيث يسكنه عائلات من الفلسطينيين الذين فروا أو طردوا من منازلهم خلال حرب فلسطين عام 1948، أما المحافظة فيقطنها حوالي 314,866 نسمة.\nتصل مساحة مدينة جنين وحدها إلى 21,000 دونم، مما يجعلها خامس أكبر مدينة فلسطينية في الضفة الغربية بعد مدن الخليل ونابلس وطولكرم ويطا، بينما تبلغ مساحة محافظة جنين 583 كيلومترًا مربعًا أي 9,7% من مساحة الضفة الغربية الإجمالية. يتبع المدينة مخيم جنين الذي يقع غربها ويسكنه 16,000 لاجئ. وترتفع المدينة عن سطح البحر بمعدل 175 متراً.\nعُرفت جنين بعدد من الأسماء عبر الزمن، وقد ورد اسم المدينة في مصادر وآثار المصريين القدماء والبابليين والآشوريين، فوفقًا لعلماء الآثار فإن الكنعانيين هم من أسسها في حدود سنة 2450 قبل الميلاد، وبهذا تعتبر من أقدم مدن العالم التي لا تزال مأهولة بالسكان. كانت تسمى قديمًا عين جانيم وتعني الجنائن، حيث ارتبط اسم المدينة بمرج بن عامر الذي يعتبر أخصب أراضي فلسطين التاريخية، وفي عهد الرومان كان في بقعتها قرية ذكرت باسم «جيناي» من قرى سَبَسْطية.\nسيطرت على جنين الكثير من القوى، فكانت تارة تنهض وتارة أخرى تنتكس، إلا أن المدينة ازدهرت في أواخر الحكم العثماني وتأسس فيها أول مجلس بلدي في عام 1886. تطورت الحياة في جنين بصورة متسارعة عبر ما يزيد عن القرن بازدياد عدد اللاجئين إليها، حتى بلغت منزلتها المهمة بين المدن الكبرى بالضفة الغربية في العصر الحديث.\nكان لمدينة جنين شأن عظيم في النضال الوطني الفلسطيني منذ بداية الصراع الفلسطيني الإسرائيلي، وظلت هاجسا بالنسبة لإسرائيل بسبب قربها من مدن الداخل ومشاركة عدد كبير من أبناءها في العمل المسلح ضد إسرائيل، خصوصا بعد الانتفاضة الثانية.",
