Bahla Fort (Arabic: قلعة بهلاء, romanized: Qalʿat Bahlāʿ) is one of four historic fortresses situated at the foot of the Jebel Akhdar highlands in Oman and was the country's first UNESCO-listed fort added in 1987.
In 1988, the Archaeological Sites of Bat, Al-Khutm and Al-Ayn became the second Omani site to be declared World Heritage by UNESCO.
Bahla Fort underwent massive restoration efforts and reopened in 2012. However, the complex lacks in visitor information. There are no exhibits or brochures available to learn more about this large space or guides at hand to provide further details, so people either need to go on a tour or explore on their own.

History of Bahla Fort
The fort is believed to have been built between the 12th and 15th century by the Banu Nebhan tribe who inhabited the area at the time and were known for controlling the trade of frankincense.
As part of the complex, there is also a citadel oasis adjacent to the fort and an ancient wall spanning 13 kilometres part of which are still standing. The majority of the oasis is in ruins but the structure and some of the houses still stand.
As the fort was built with bricks made of mud and straw, erosion damaged the structure until rehabilitation efforts were launched. There are a lot of legends surrounding the castle.

Structure of Bahla Fort
There are three main parts inside the fort. The oldest part of the fort is Al-Qasabah. Bait al-Hadith, or new house, was built by the Ya’riba dynasty (1624–1743). Bait Al-Jabal was erected in the 18th century.

Risks to the fort
Bahla Fort was in the list of World Heritage in Danger until 2004. Nevertheless, the fort remains at risk:

The unfired brick is likely to decay
Drainage is bad
Modern materials are used on the rebuilding of the souk

Previous restorations
Preservation attempt in 1995 was found to be a renovation not a restoration because the aim of the remodeling was to make the fort look new. This renovation began without prior archaeological, topographic, architectural or technical surveys.
Original building was mud-brick and mortar and plaster. Restoration unjustifiably used stone and cement to cover the walls so severely that the original walls could not be seen at all
Irrigation is an issue, as there have not been any recent efforts to conserve this system. Parts of the ancient wall surrounding the fort have been destroyed or altered because of nearby building construction.
In 2013,  ArCHIAM Centre led by Professor Soumyen Bandyopadhyay developed a heritage management plan for the Bahla fort and its neighbouring oasis.

The Nizwa Fort (Arabic: قلعة نزوى) is a large castle in Nizwa, Oman built in the seventeenth century. It is a popular tourist destination.

History
It was built in the 1650s by the second Ya’rubi; Imam Sultan Bin Saif Al Ya'rubi, although its underlying structure goes back to the 12th century. It is Oman's most visited national monument. The fort was the administrative seat of authority for the presiding Imams and Walis in times of peace and conflict. The main bulk of the fort took about 12 years to complete and was built above an underground stream. The fort is a powerful reminder of the town's significance through turbulent periods in Oman's long history. It was a formidable stronghold against raiding forces that desired Nizwa's abundant natural wealth and its strategic location at the crossroads of vital routes.

Layout
The fort's design reflects the Omani architectural ingenuity in the Ya’rubi era that witnessed considerable advancement in military fortifications and the introduction of mortar-based warfare. The main part of the fort is its enormous drum-like tower that rises 30 metres above the ground and has a diameter of 36 metres. The strong foundations of the fort go 30 metres into the ground, and a portion of the tower is filled with rocks, dirt and rubble. The doors are inches deep and the walls are rounded and robust, designed to withstand fierce barrages of mortar fire. There are 24 openings all around the top of the tower for mortar fire.
Two cannons guard the entrance to the fort which opens into a maze of rooms, high-ceilinged halls, doorways, terraces, narrow staircases and corridors. Four cannons remain on the tower's top, down from a total of 24, which once served as the fort’s main firepower. They provided complete 360-degree coverage of the countryside around making it virtually impossible for a surprise attack on the fort without provoking a reply from the cannons. One of them has the name of Imam Sultan bin Saif engraved on it. Another, from Boston City, was presented to the first Omani ambassador to the United States in 1840. Clumps of cannonballs, misshapen with rust and age lie around. 
The design of the tower, complete with battlements, turret, secret shafts, false doors and wells incorporates a great deal of architectural deception. Access to the top is only by means of a narrow twisty staircase barred by a heavy wooden door studded with metal spikes to exhaust the enemy and impede their progress to the top of the tower. Those who did manage to run the gauntlet of hurdles risked being burnt by boiling oil or water that was poured through shafts which opened directly above each set of doors and which are called murder holes. Date syrup, a liquid that oozed from bags of dates stored in special date cellars, also came in handy as an alternative to oil and water. The fort was built above a subterranean stream that ensured a permanent supply of water when subjected to a prolonged siege. Several cisterns located within the fortified compound also ensured plentiful supplies. Underground cellars stockpiled food and munitions. Running all round the summit of the tower is a wall for use by 120 guards who kept watch over the surrounding countryside and were armed with muskets and flintlocks. Furthermore, 480 gun-ports allowed for a concentrated barrage of fire if the fort came under attack.
There are around 6 pitfalls to catch enemies off guard in the dark passageway. Some of the stairs has wooden planks that could be removed to expose deep, gaping pits which were certain to put an end to anyone unfortunate enough to fall into them.
Nizwa Fort is open from 8:00am to 8:00pm every day Friday from 8:00am to 11:30am and 1:30pm to 8:00pm. Admission fees are OMR 5, OMR 2 for Omanis while the children go in free (Jan. 10, 2020).

Etymology
The name of this town is a derived from the Middle Iranian rōstāg, meaning "district" (also in Baluchi, Persian, Kumzari, etc.), New Iranian rusta, meaning a 'large village.'  The term is a cognate to other Indo-European tongues such as Latin, where 'rustica', means the same thing (whence the source for the English term, 'rustic').

Geography
Rustaq is located amidst the Hajar Mountains, and they surround the city from all directions except the northern side. This northern side is the direction from which the city opens up to the coastal regions in the area of Al-Batinah (including Al-Musannah and Al-Suwayq), which is the most active and important vital passage in the region. It is also considered a link connecting the city to the Omani capital, Muscat, which is only 160 km away. Rustaq is also distinguished by its rocky and sandy desert environment in the northeastern direction.

Climate
History
During the days of the Sasanian Empire, Al-Rustaq had a Persian marzban (military governor), whom Sasanians in the area would report to. Dibba and Tuwwam, which Oman today shares with the U.A.E., were taxed by Al-Julanda, who were clients of the Sasanians. There are also historical mosques in Rustaq, including Al-Bayada Mosque, the Basra Mosque, and the Qasra Mosque.

Rustaq Castle
Rustaq Fort, built four centuries prior to the 7th century C.E., is an imposing structure built on three levels, containing separate houses, an armoury, a mosque and four towers. The tallest tower stands over 18.5 m (61 ft) high, and has a diameter of 6 m (20 ft).
The Rustaq Castle (Arabic: قَلْعَة ٱلرُّسْتَاق, romanized: Qalʿat Ar-Rustāq) is located on the slopes of the Green Mountain at the edge of the Batinah plain in the Rustaq province of South Al Batinah Governorate. The castle was initially built on Persian ruins around the year 1250 AD, but the impressive current structure was rebuilt by the first Imams of the dynasty of Ya'Aruba during the period from 1624 to 1649 AD. It consists of two main floors in addition to the ground floor, featuring residences, weapon storage rooms, reception rooms, gates, a mosque, prisons, wells, and other facilities.
In Rustaq Castle, there are four towers that were constructed in the years 1477 and 1906. The first one is the "Red Tower," which stands at a height of over 16 meters and has a diameter of nine and a half meters. The second tower is the "Wind Tower," built by Imam Saif bin Sultan Al Ya'arubi, whose tomb is located in the western corner of the castle. The "Wind Tower" reaches a height of 12 meters and has a diameter of 12 meters as well, with a hundred decorative triangles surrounding its walls.
The third tower is the "Devils Tower," also built by Imam Saif bin Sultan Al Ya'arubi, and is nicknamed the "Underground Tower." It has a height of 18 and a half meters and a diameter of about six meters, with five decorative triangles encircling its walls. The fourth tower is the "Modern Tower," constructed during the reign of Imam Ahmed bin Said. It stands at a height of 11 and a half meters and is adorned with eighty decorative triangles.
Within Rustaq Castle, there are ten cannons. Four of them are in the Modern Tower, three in the Wind Tower, and the remaining three at the lower section of the castle. The castle is also equipped with four gates: Ya'Aruba Gate, Al A'la Gate, Central Gate, and Sarhah Gate.
Castle dimensions: Length 60 meters, Width 45 meters, Total area: 2700 square meters.

Al-Hazm Fortress
Al-Hazm Castle is an outstanding example of Omani Islamic architecture and was built in 1711 AD. The fort's roof is built on columns, and contains no wooden supports. Its walls, at no less than 3 m (9.8 ft) thick at any point, can withstand great impact.
It is located in the Rustaq province of South Al Batinah Governorate and features a military stronghold that is among the traditional Omani defense landmarks. It includes prominent elements such as the massive wooden gate, secret escape tunnels, fortified towers, and upper-level gunports. There are also openings at the entrance used for pouring boiling oil or date honey on charging attackers.
It is also considered one of the most exquisite examples of Omani Islamic architectural treasures. It was built by Imam Sultan bin Saif bin Sultan Al Ya'arubi in the year 1711 CE. The fort stands out for its absence of wooden roofs, instead utilizing fixed round contracts resembling cylinders. The wall width is three meters, and the fort features several massive gates that do not meet in a single passage.
The fort houses various historical Portuguese and Spanish cannons with a firing range of up to 70 kilometers. It boasts specialized horse ascent staircases to the upper parts of the fort, along with secret passageways, each two meters wide and two meters high, dispersed in all four directions of the fort, leading out to the city. In the Hazm Fort, there are several rooms used for teaching the Quran, sciences, and religious knowledge. The fort is crossed by the Hazm Falaj, serving residents and visitors of the fort. The total area of the fort is 1600 square meters.

The area is adorned with unique old mosques and prayer halls, such as Al 'Ulayyah Mosque and Al Bia'dah Mosque located within Rustaq Castle, along with Qasri Mosque.

Springs and wells
Rustaq is an area of healing warm springs, the most notable being 'Ain al-Kasafa. Its waters runs at 45 °C (113 °F) and are regarded as a cure for rheumatism and skin diseases due to its sulphur content.
There are three popular wadis to visit: Wadi Bani Ghafar, Wadi al-Sahtan and Wadi Bani Awf. In addition, the mountains are pitted with caves such as Al Sanaqha Cave with its own subterranean springs. One of the main occupations in Rustaq is beekeeping. Pure Omani honey is a most sought-after commodity and is of the highest quality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nakhal Fort (Arabic: قَلْعَة نَخَل, romanized: Qalʿat Nakhal) is a large fortification in Al Batinah Region of Oman. It is named after the Wilayah of Nakhal.

History
The fort, also known as Husn Al Heem, was named after the state of Nakhal that exists above the old village of Nakhl. Imams of Wadi Bani Kharous and the Ya'arubah dynasty resided here in the past. Over the centuries, it underwent many renovations and improvements. It was reconstructed by Omani architects in the 17th century. Initially built as a protective measure for an area oasis and nearby trade routes, it passes through the regional capital of Nizwa. The gateway and towers seen now were extensions built in 1834 attributed to imam Said bin Sultan. In 1990, it was fully renovated.
In November 2003, the Prince of Wales Charles (now Charles III) visited the restored fort during an official visit to Oman.

Overview
The fort is approximately 120 kilometres (75 mi) to the west of Muscat, the capital of Oman, at the entrance of Wilayt Nakhal in Wadi Ar Raqeem. It is situated on a rocky prominence at the foot of Jebel Nakhal, a spur of the main Western Hajar range. It is to the northeast of Jabal Akhdar also called green mountain. Nakhal Fort is surrounded by orchards of palm trees. Its battlements provide a view of the Al Batinah Region. The ancient Nakhal village is below the fort and close by is the warm springs of Ain A'Thawwarah. Nakhal Fort is one of several fortifications in the Al Batinah Region, the others being Al Hazim, Al-Sifalah, Rustaq, and Shinas forts.
Built in the architectural style of the Sultanate of Oman, it is unique in that it was built to fit around an irregularly-shaped rock, with some rock exposures jutting out into the interiors. The fort houses a museum, operated by the Ministry of Tourism with exhibits of historic guns. A weekly Friday goat auction market takes place within the precincts of the fort. During recent renovations the fort has been fitted with traditional furniture, handicrafts and historic artifacts.

The Archaeological Sites of Bat, Al-Khutm and Al-Ayn (Arabic: ٱلْمَوَاقِع ٱلْأَثَرِيَّة فِيْ بَات وَٱلْخُطْم وَٱلْعَيْن, romanized: Al-Mawāqiʿ al-Athariyyah fī Bāt wal-Khuṭm wal-ʿAyn) are a group of beehive tombs or necropolis from the Hafit period in the 3rd Millennium BC, located near a palm grove in Oman. They were declared World Heritage by UNESCO in 1988, becoming only the second such Omani site after the Bahla Fort was designated world heritage in 1987.

History or prehistory
Studies during the last 15 years have shown the existence of numerous human settlements ranging from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman.

Bat
The site of Bat is located inside a palm grove. Around 3000 B.C., there was an intense trade of copper (extracted locally) and stone (probably diorite) with Sumerians. The necropolis consists of 100 graves and circular buildings each with a diameter of about 20 metres (66 feet). These buildings have no outside openings, so besides the possibility of their ritualistic function, they may have been used as tanks or silos. Their precise function is as of yet unknown. In 1972, the excavations carried out by a Danish team led by Karen Frifelt showed that the area has been continuously inhabited for 4000 years.

Al-Khutm
The ruins at Al-Khutm are thought to have derived from a stone fort, with a tower made of rock with a diameter of 20 metres (66 feet). They are located 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) west of Bat.

Al-Ayn
Al-Ayn is a small necropolis, although it is in the best condition of the three necropolises. It is located 22 kilometres (14 miles) southeast of Bat.

Conservation
The sites have not been subjected to restoration or other types of conservation before the protection provided by UNESCO, so their isolation has been their only protection. One of the greatest dangers concerning the sites preservation comes from locals who take building material from the archaeological sites.

Development
A road between Oman and Saudi Arabia, which goes through the villages, was completed in September 2021. Measuring between 700 and 800 kilometres (430 and 500 miles) in total, it extends from the town of Ibri in Oman to Al-Ahsa in eastern Saudi Arabia. The Omani side of the road measures approximately 160 km (99 miles), and the Saudi side 580 km (360 miles).

The Land of Frankincense (Arabic: أرض البخور, romanized: ʿArḍ al-Bakhūr) is a site in Oman on the Incense Road. The site includes frankincense trees, Khor Rori and the remains of a caravan oasis, which were crucial to the medieval incense trade. 
The site was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 as Frankincense Trail and was renamed in 2005 to Land of Frankincense. Although Somalia is home to the largest frankincense forests, Oman has capitalized on the challenges faced by the African nation, positioning itself as the primary source of frankincense.

Al-Baleed Archaeological Park is an archaeological park located in Al Balīd (Arabic: البليد) of Salalah, Dhofar, Oman. It is a part of the Land of Frankincense in the UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000.
The ruins in the park belong to the medieval city of Ẓafār/Ẓufār (Arabic: ظفار) which also covers the adjacent area in Ar Rubāṭ (Arabic: الرباط). Ẓafār/Ẓufar, from which the Dhofar Governorate got its name, acted as an important port for frankincense trade after the decline of the nearby port in Khor Rori. It is sometimes associated with Sapphara Metropolis mentioned by ancient Greek/Roman authors, but this name more likely refers to the ancient Himyarite city with the same name.
It was visited by many famous travellers, such as Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, Ibn al-Mujawir and Zheng He. The city declined in the 16th–17th centuries due to various reasons such as the closure of the lake Khawr al Balīd (which used to be a bay) and Portuguese/Turkish/Mamluk invasion.
The park also contains the Museum of the Land of Frankincense.

Khor Rori (Arabic: خور روري, romanized: Khawr Rawrī) is a bar-built estuary at the mouth of Wādī Darbāt in the Dhofar Governorate, Oman, near Taqah. It is an intermittently closed/open lake/lagoon, with an inlet from Arabian Sea that is usually disconnected. It is a major breeding ground for birds, and used to act as an important harbour for frankincense trade when it was an open estuary. The area represents a popular tourist spot within Oman and since 2000, is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Land of Frankincense.
Khor Rori is best known for the ruins of the ancient fortified port city of Sumhuram on the eastern bank, which was founded in the 3rd century BC as an outpost for the Kingdom of Ḥaḍramawt. After the eclipse of Ḥaḍramawt, Sumhuram was under the influence of the Kingdom of Ḥimyar, as indicated by the Himyarite coins excavated from there. It was finally abandoned in the 5th century, most likely due to the formation of the sandbar blocking the estuary.
There are also archaeological ruins on the two promontories at the mouth of Khor Rori. The eastern promontory (Inqitat Mirbat) is better explored than the western promontory (Inqitat Taqah). Inqitat Mirbat, also known as Khatiya or al-Ḥamr al-Sharqiya, had been inhabited by the 4th century BC before the emergence of Sumhuram, and its settlement history might date back to the 8th century BC. It was abandoned in the 1st or 2nd century, and re-occupied in the medieval period.

History
Inscriptions at Khor Rori report that the town of Sumhuram (Hadramautic: s1mhrm), was founded on royal initiative and settled by Hadhrami emigrants. The Dhofar region was the main source of frankincense in the ancient period, and it seems likely that the foundation of the settlement by the Hadhramaut was in part motivated by wish to control the production of this valuable commodity.
Khor Rori has been tentatively identified as the location of Moscha Limen (Ancient Greek: Μόσχα λιμήν, probably meaning "the harbour of young shoots (μόσχος)" and referring to the possible mangrove vegetation in the past), or else "the harbour of musk, perfume" The name appeared in the anonymous Periplus of the Erythraean Sea of the 1st century CE, and in Ptolemy's Geographia in the next century. It has also been identified with Abissa polis or Abyssapolis (Ancient Greek: Ἄβισσα πόλις) from Ptolemy; this name has first been connected with the abyss besides the waterfall of Wādī Darbāt, but may be related to the Abyssinian people. The existence of an ancient port city in this area has been expected by 19th century western geographers based on the classical and Arabic sources. In the 1890s the location was pointed out by Eduard Glaser, and English explorer James Theodore Bent, who visited it in January 1895 with his wife Mabel, published a description of it, and reiterated the double identification.
In 1908, J.G. Lorimer recorded Khor Rori in his Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, noting its location as the eastern extremity of Dhofar proper. He wrote:

A remarkable lake or inlet of the sea running a mile or more inland; it is the estuary of Wadi Dirbat from Jabal Samhan.
The inlet is divided from the sea by a sand bar over which the water flows at high tide. A peninsula, once fortified, adjoins the east side of the entrance. Remains of ancient buildings surround the lake. There is a fortified rock at the entrance to the inlet, which is called Khatiyah. This harbour is the ancient Moscha, or Abyssapolis. 
The site has been excavated by the American Foundation for the Study of Man (AFSM) in the early 1950s and by the Italian Mission to Oman (IMTO) since 1994. The excavations have uncovered the ground plan of the settlement and has attested maritime contacts with the Ḥaḑramite homeland, India and the Mediterranean.
It was inscribed in 2000, along with other sites along the Incense Route in Oman, as part of the World Heritage Site "Land of Frankincense".

Other contexts
In tourism literature, Sumhuram is occasionally promoted as the summer palace of the Queen of Sheba, the legendary ruler of the Sabaʾ Kingdom living in the 10th century BC. 
Some members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints believe that Khor Rori is the "land Bountiful" where Nephi from the Book of Mormon stayed during his travels from Jerusalem (First Nephi, chapter 17).
However, current archaeological evidence indicates that Sumhuram was founded in the 3rd century BC by the Kingdom of Ḥaḍramawt.

The Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque (Arabic: جَامِع ٱلسُّلْطَان قَابُوْس ٱلْأَكْبَر, romanized: Jāmiʿ As-Sulṭān Qābūs Al-Akbar) is a Friday mosque located in Muscat, the capital city of the Sultanate of Oman. Completed in 2001 in a contemporary Islamic style, it is the largest mosque in the country and can accommodate 20,000 worshipers.

Architecture
Construction
In 1992, the then Sultan of Oman, Qaboos bin Said Al Said, directed that his country should have a Grand Mosque. In 1993, a competition for the design of the proposed mosque took place. The building contract was awarded to Carillion Alawi LLC. Construction commenced in December 1994, after a site was chosen at Bausher, and it took six years and seven months to build the mosque.
The mosque is made of different type of stones, with doors, windows and embellishments made of wood and glass. Approximately 270,000 tonnes (300,000 short tons) of Indian sandstone was imported for the building. Five minarets were built around the premises of the mosque: the main minaret is 90 metres (300 ft) high, and the four flanking minarets are 45.5 metres (149 ft) high. Together, they are the mosque’s chief visual features from the exterior. In the interior, the main musalla is the focus of both prayer and tourism. The 5,476-square-metre (58,940 sq ft) square prayer hall has a central dome that is 50 metres (160 ft) above the floor. The dome is embellished spectacularly from the inside and it is a major tourist attraction. The main musalla can hold over 6,500 worshippers, while the women's musalla can accommodate 750 worshipers. The outer sahn can hold 8,000 worshipers and there is additional space available in the interior courtyard and the passageways, making a total capacity of up to 20,000 worshipers.
The mosque is built on a site occupying 416,000 square metres (4,480,000 sq ft), and the complex extends to cover an area of more than 40,000 square metres (430,000 sq ft). The Grand Mosque was inaugurated by Sultan of Oman on May 4, 2001 to celebrate 30 years of his reign.

Interior
A major feature of the design of the interior is the prayer carpet which covers the floor of the prayer hall. It contains 1.7 million knots, weighs 21 tonnes (21 long tons; 23 short tons) and took four years to produce with over 600 workers. The carpet brings together the classical Persian Tabriz, Kashan and Isfahan design traditions. 28 colors in varying shades were used, the majority obtained from traditional vegetable dyes. It was the largest single-piece carpet in the world, until 2018, when the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, the UAE was completed. This Muscat hand-woven carpet was produced by Iran Carpet Company (ICC) at the order of the Diwan of the Royal Court of Sultanate. The carpet measures over 70 by 60 metres (230 by 200 feet), and covers the floor of the 4,343-square-metre (46,750 sq ft)  prayer hall.
The 14-metre-high (46 ft) chandelier was manufactured by the Italian company Faustig. Since the mosque is 90 metres (300 feet) high, the chandelier looks proportional, and it was the world's largest chandelier, prior to the 2018 completion of the Sheikh Zayed Mosque in Abu Dhabi. The Muscat chandelier weighs 7.7 tonnes (8.5 short tons), includes 600,000 crystals, 1,122 halogen bulbs complete with a dimming system, and includes a staircase for maintenance within the chandelier. Thirty-four smaller chandeliers of the same design are hung in other parts of the building.

The Royal Opera House Muscat (ROHM) is Oman's premier venue for musical arts and culture. The opera house is located in Shati Al-Qurm district of Muscat on Sultan Qaboos Street. Built on the royal orders of Sultan Qaboos of Oman, the Royal Opera House reflects unique contemporary Omani architecture, and has a capacity to accommodate maximum of 1,100 people. The opera house complex consists of a concert theatre, auditorium, formal landscaped gardens, cultural market with retail, luxury restaurants and an art centre for musical, theatrical and operatic productions.

History
Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said, who was the ruler of Oman during the opera construction, had been always a fan of classical music and arts. In 2001, the sultan ordered the building of an opera house. Initially called 'House of Musical Arts', the name 'Royal Opera House Muscat (ROHM)' was finally chosen. This opera house, which was built by Carillion Alawi, became the first in the world equipped with Radio Marconi's multimedia interactive display seatback system, Mode23. It was officially opened on October 12, 2011, with a production of the opera Turandot, conducted by Spanish tenor Plácido Domingo.

Prominent guests
The opera house had an impressive first season, with performances by Plácido Domingo, Andrea Bocelli, and soprano Renée Fleming. There have also been music performances by cellist Yo Yo Ma and the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the American Ballet Theatre in a production of Don Quixote, The Paul Taylor Dance Company, the performance of Swan Lake by the Mariinsky Ballet, and trumpeter Wynton Marsalis with New York's Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. There have been some Arab artists performing at the opera house as well such as Majida El Roumi as well as a tribute in honour of legendary Arab singer Um Kalthoum. In March 2013, Indian violin icon L. Subramaniam performed at the opera house and described it as the only orchestra in the Middle East composed entirely of musicians from the region.

Misfat al Abriyeen or Misfah al Abriyyin (Arabic: مسفاة العبريين, romanized: msfā ālʿbryyn) is a village in the wilayah of Al Hamra in Oman.
Located in an oasis at 900 metres (3,000 ft) above sea level in the Western Hajar mountains, it has an extensive falaj water canalization system which dates back more than 2,000 years. It is still in use nowadays to supply the village with water from a local spring, and to irrigate the terraced fields where crops such as mangoes, pomegranates, figs, and olives are grown.
The settlement is perched on a rock, which acts as a natural fortification, and is characterized by narrow stone-paved roads and houses built with mud, stone and sarooj. Several of the buildings that are still standing date back more than 200 years. Its architectural style has been described as similar to that of the Yemeni highlands.
The village has undergone significant restoration work in the past years, with the creation of new hotels and heritage houses, and has been placed in the Best Tourism Villages list by the World Tourism Organization in 2021.
The valley of Wadi Al-Saq can be reached from the village, and is a tourist destination for hiking and trekking. From Misfat departs the trekking route W9 along an ancient donkey path, leading to the junction with W8 to Bilad Sayt and W10 to Sharaf Al Alamayn.

Population
As of 2020, the village counted 962 inhabitants. Of these, 901 were Omani nationals and 61 foreign residents (6.3%). 39.2% of the inhabitants (377) were 14 years old or younger, while only 44 residents (4.6%) were 65 or older. Most of the inhabitants are of Bedouin descent.

Hawiyyat Najm (Arabic: هوية نجم), known as Bimmah Sinkhole in English, is a water-filled depression, structurally a sinkhole, in the limestone of eastern Muscat Governorate in the Sultanate of Oman, very close to the Al Sharqiyah region just off the highway to Sur, few kilometers before Tiwi.

Location
To preserve the sinkhole, the local municipality developed a fenced and toilet-equipped park, Hawiyat Najm Park, around it, along with a stairway leading down to the hole.

Geology
A lake of turquoise waters, it is 50 m by 70 m wide and approximately 20 m deep.  It is only about 600 m away from the sea, between the coastal towns of Ḑibāb and Bamah (Bimmah). The sinkhole was formed by a collapse of the surface layer due to dissolution of the underlying limestone. However, locals used to believe this sinkhole in the shape of a water well was created by a meteorite, hence the Arabic name Hawiyyat Najm which means "the deep well of the (falling) star".
Bimmah Sinkhole ranges in depth from only a few feet to over 300+ feet in the deepest part.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nizwa (Arabic: نِزْوَى, romanized: Nizwā) is the largest city in Ad Dakhiliyah Region in Oman and was the capital of Oman proper. Nizwa is about 140 km (87 miles) (1.5 hour drive) from the Omani capital Muscat. The population is estimated at around 83,544 people.
Nizwa is one of the oldest cities in Oman, and was once a center of trade, religion, education and art. Its Jama (grand mosque) was formerly a center for Islamic learning. Nizwa acquired its importance because it has been an important meeting point at the base of the Western Hajar Mountains. Set amid a verdant spread of date palms, it is strategically located at the crossroads of routes linking the interior with Muscat and the lower reaches of Dhofar, thus serving as the link for a large part of the country. Today, Nizwa is a diverse prosperous place with numerous agricultural, historical and recreational aspects. Nizwa is a center for date growing and is the market place for the area.

Etymology
Historians cannot agree on the origins of the name of the city. Some suggest the name was derived from the Arabic verb (Arabic: انزوا) which means being alone. Others say that the city was named after an old water spring.

History
Nizwa was the capital of Oman in the 6th and 7th centuries AD. With its deep connection to the root of Islam, Nizwa possesses a number of renowned mosques, such as Sultan Qaboos Jama (Friday mosque), So'al Mosque built in the 2nd century AH (9th century AD), Ash-Shawathinah Mosque in Uqr and Ash-Sharja Mosque. There are also Al-Ain Mosque, Ash-Sheikh Mosque and Shuraij Mosque in Tanuf built in 377 AH (around 1000 AD).
A handwritten letter from the Islamic Prophet Muhammad in 630 asked the locals of the mountain town of Nizwa to convert. The locals then sent a return delegation to Medina and embraced Islam. A tutor was sent by Muhammad to teach the new Muslims of Nizwa the fundamentals of the religion.
The explorer Ibn Battuta visited in the 14th century, noting Nizwa as "a city at the foot of a mountain, enveloped by orchards and streams, and with fine bazaars and splendid clean mosques."
In the early 1950s, the large round tower of the ancient fort built in the center of the town was bombed and rocketed by the British Royal Air Force, who were called in to assist the then-reigning Sultan Said bin Taimur in suppressing a revolt by leaders of the interior Imamate of Oman. The conflict was driven by a struggle for a share of Oman's newly discovered oil wealth.
Nizwa has become a more modern city since 1970 under the reign of Sultan Qaboos. Improvements include connections to Muscat via a two-lane highway, which has increased tourism.  Communications have been improved to include broadband access, and the city is home to a substantial hospital. It is also a hub for education including a technical college, College of Applied Sciences, The University of Nizwa, and the training academy for the Royal Oman Police. There are now many hotels and tourism is promoted in the area.

Geography and climate
Mountains surround Nizwa on every side and there is outstanding mountain scenery close by. Nizwa has an arid climate under the Köppen climate classification. In the winter from November until March the climate is pleasant, with temperatures as low as 12 degrees Celsius in January. In the summer, the climate is hot and dry with temperatures reaching 45 degrees Celsius in July.

Attractions
The main tourist attractions in the city are the Nizwa Fort, the traditional souq or market, and the Falaj Daris irrigation system, which was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006. In the 1990s, the mosque, fort, and souq, which are located next to each other in the city centre, were renovated using traditional materials. In 1993, Nizwa won the award of 'Organisation of Arab Cities'.

Nizwa Fort
Nizwa Fort was built in 1668 AD by Imam Sultan Bin Saif Al Ya'rubi, and today is Oman's most visited national monument. The fort was the administrative seat of authority for the presiding imams and walis in times of peace and conflict. The main bulk of the fort took about 12 years to complete and was built above an underground stream. The fort is a reminder of the town's significance through turbulent periods in Oman's long history. It was a formidable stronghold against raiding forces that desired Nizwa's abundant natural wealth and its strategic crossroads location.

Nizwa Souq
The city, famous for its handicrafts and agricultural products, has an expansive souq with an array of products. It is one of the most important in the country besides Muttrah. The souq bustles with vendors selling everything from meat, fish, fruits and vegetables to spices, dates, gold and silverware. Nizwa is renowned for its silver jewelry which is considered to be the best in the country. Its people are masters in making khanjars (curved daggers), recognized for their distinctive style and patterns. They also make copperware, coffee pots, swords, leather goods and pottery.

Falaj Daris
Falaj Daris, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the largest falaj, or irrigation system, in Oman. It provides the surrounding countryside with much-needed water for farming. Al Ghantuq and Dhoot are two other important irrigation systems in Nizwa. Farming is widely practiced and the town's immense palm farms stretch for eight kilometers along the course of two wadis, Kalbouh and Al Abiad.

Economy
Historically, Nizwa was known for producing mats from straw. As of 1920, the city was described as having a "thriving" metalworking industry.

Education
University of Nizwa
University of Technology and Applied Sciences

Transportation
A short drive from Nizwa centre is the old village of Tanuf, known for its seasonal waterfalls. Waterfalls in Tanuf are unique to the area within the steep mountain sides and the water reservoir.
Nizwa is connected to the U.A.E. city of Al Ain by road, via the Mezyad border post. This road also goes past the Provinces of Ibri and Dhank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Salalah (Arabic: صَلَالَة, romanized: Ṣalālah) is the capital and largest city of the southern Omani governorate of Dhofar. It has a population close to 331,949.
Salalah is the third-largest city in the Sultanate of Oman, and the largest city in the Dhofar province. Salalah is the birthplace of former Omani Sultan Qaboos bin Said. Salalah attracts many tourists from other parts of Oman and from abroad during the monsoon/khareef season, from June to September. The climate of the region and the monsoon allow the city to grow some vegetables and fruits like coconut and bananas. There are many gardens within the city where these vegetables and fruits grow.

History
Salalah currently is and was the traditional capital of Dhofar, which reached the peak of prosperity in the 13th century thanks to the incense trade. Later it decayed, and in the 19th century it was absorbed by the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman.
Between 1932 and 1970, Salalah was the residence of Sultan Said bin Taimur. His son, Qaboos, who acceded to his father's throne in 1970, decided to move his capital to Muscat, the largest city in Oman, where he lived until he quietly left for treatment in Germany. Sultan Qaboos's absence was much regretted in Salalah, where his palace was always kept ready to receive him. His last visits were in 2006 to meet influential tribal and local leaders, and in 2010 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of his accession with a massive parade watched for several hours by an estimated 100,000 spectators.
Despite the Sultan's generally benevolent government running Oman without national taxation, thanks to its vast mineral resources, and with all menial work done by Asian labourers, Salalah saw peaceful protests for a few months in 2011 in the domino effect of the Arab Spring. Some Omani protesters demanded the dismissal of current ministers, better job opportunities, salary increases, a solution to the increasing cost of living, or the establishment of Islamic banks.

Demographics
Religion
The city, like many other in Arab states of the Arabian Peninsula, has a relatively large expatriate community, mainly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the Philippines.
The majority of the Omani population (98.9%) in Salalah is Muslim. Unlike Omanis on the eastern coast of Oman in and around Muscat, most of whom are Ibadis, most Muslims in Salalah follow the Sunni sect of Islam. There is also a considerable population of Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, and Sikhs in the expatriate community.

Language
Arabic is the official language. The unofficial, unwritten non-Arabic language known as Shehri is the second most spoken language and the mother tongue of many in Salalah and its surrounding areas, with 25,000 estimated speakers as of 1993.
English is the official foreign language and the most spoken language of the expats. Malayalam is another popular language and together with Tamil, Telugu, along with Urdu, Hindi, European Spanish, Catalan, Romanian and Somali are widely spoken language among expatriates.

Economy
APM Terminals, part of the A. P. Moller-Maersk Group of Denmark, manages the Port of Salalah; one of the largest ports on the Arabian Peninsula which is an important transshipment hub for container shipping in the area. The Port of Salalah is also one of the most vital ports on the peninsula connecting together Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. But the port is outside the city, to the south. It is also the largest private employer in the Dhofar region. The Salalah Free Zone, situated right beside the port, is emerging as a new center for heavy industries in the Middle East.

Tourism
Salalah has an international tourist economy with many Middle Eastern tourists during the Khareef season from June to September. In this season the mountains turn green, and there are many waterfalls to visit, such as at Wadi Darbat, Ain Athum, Ain Tubrook, and Ain Khor. There are four reputed tombs of Islamic prophets: Nabi Imran, possibly the Virgin Mary's father but more likely a local prophet; Nabi Ayoob, the biblical Job; Nabi Houd; and Nabi Salih. The city received more than 600,000 tourists during the khareef season in 2017. Amongst the Dhofar Governorate's cultural attractions is the Salalah carnival, which includes the usual rides, family activities, concerts, cultural events and vendors.
One of Joachim's or Al Imran's believed graves is in Salalah; which is claimed to be the "longest grave in the world" (12 metres).

Climate
The city has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), although summers are cooler than in more northern or inland parts of Oman. Salalah is very cloudy and foggy during the monsoon months of July and August, even though it receives relatively little rainfall. Khareef, خريف means "autumn" in Arabic, but it refers to monsoon when describing the region around Salalah. During this time, the brown landscape of Salalah and its surroundings are completely transformed to beautiful and lush green scenes. This provides picturesque scenes for photos. 
Cyclone Mekunu, which originated over the Arabian Sea, became an extremely severe cyclone before hitting the Salalah city on 25 May 2018. 200 km/h was the recorded windspeed, and the city of Salalah was pounded with over 617 mm (24.3 in) of rainfall, which is almost 5 years of Oman's average rainfall.

Sports
Salalah is known as the home of some of the best football clubs in Oman. In total, Salalah has four sport clubs based in the city: Salalah Club, Al-Ittihad, Al-Nasr, and Dhofar (the most successful club in the League with 11 trophies).
Dhofar F.C. have been nicknamed as "Al-Zaeem", or "The Leader(s)", due to their enormous success in both the Omani League, and in the Sultan Qaboos Cup.  Dhofar also have an adequate number of trophies in sports like volleyball, and handball. Al-Nasr have also been known for their great success in football, winning the Omani League five times, and the Sultan Qaboos Cup 4 times. Al-Nasr, like Dhofar, have also been successful in other sports such as hockey, basketball, volleyball, and handball.
Salalah currently has two stadiums, the Salalah Sports Complex (also known as the "Youth Sports Complex"), which is the only multi-purpose stadium in Salalah.  The newer, Al-Saadah Stadium is the newly built stadium in Al-Saada district of Salalah devoted to football.  Incorporated in the walls of the sports complex apart from the football stadium is a hockey field, tennis court, Olympic swimming pool, and indoor volleyball/basketball court. Al-Saada Stadium is the venue where Saudi national football team, and the Omani national team first met in Salalah on August 12, 2009.
The most popular sport played among the youth is by far football. It is very normal to see a group of boys and young men from around the area playing in makeshift fields in parking lots, or in a large open area. Beach football is also a common sight to see along the beach in the Al-Haffa district. Another popular sport in Salalah is volleyball. Although not as popular as football the game is frequently played, special in the beach of Salalah.
In December 2026, Salalah will host the finish of the Budapest–Baghdad–Salalah Rally, a transcontinental endurance rally spanning over 10,000 kilometers. The route starts in Budapest and passes through numerous countries across Europe and the Middle East – including Iraq and Saudi Arabia – before reaching its final destination in southern Oman. The event is a unique blend of adventure travel and motorsport, where participants compete or tour in various vehicle categories such as motorcycles, cars, quads, and side-by-sides. Designed in the spirit of minimalist assistance, the rally combines challenging navigation with cultural interaction, aiming to showcase the natural beauty and hospitality of the regions along the route. Salalah, as the endpoint, plays a symbolic and celebratory role, highlighting its geographical and cultural significance.

Education
Currently Salalah has two colleges, the Salalah College of Technology and Salalah College of Applied Science, both of which are government owned and sponsored.
The Salalah College of Applied Sciences incorporates an English Department. Its aim is to offer students a solid grasp of the English language so that they may go on to complete further studies in important sectors such as I.T. and Communication and Design.
Salalah is also home to a private university, Dhofar University which is one of the largest in the region. It has significant shares owned by Mustahil Al-Mashani, uncle of Sultan Qaboos bin Said. Recently the university has constructed a new campus worth 25 million OR.
British School Salalah was founded in 1970. The school follows the National Curriculum of England and Wales, and offers schooling to children from Reception to Year 10 (Year 11 from August 2021). It is also situated in Dahariz next to the Indian School and Pakistani School.
The Indian School Salalah, established in 1981, is an Indian-run, self-financing, co-educational institution, primarily established to meet the academic needs of children of Indian expatriates working in Salalah.

Transportation

Salalah International Airport mainly caters to domestic flights from Muscat and some International flights from India and regional Arab countries such as Qatar, U.A.E, and Saudi Arabia. Oman Air, the national airline operates five flights daily from Salalah to Muscat, the capital city and also two flights to Dubai weekly.
Oman Air introduced Oman Air Pass for regular travelers between Salalah and Muscat. Qatar Airways has daily flights from Salalah to Doha connecting to over 130 destinations worldwide.
Very convenient connections are available to destinations in Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia and Australia. There is also a direct weekly flight from and to Kochi, Kozhikode (Calicut) for the Malayalee expatriates. During the Khareef Season (Monsoons) there are weekly flights to other international destinations including Sweden and Turkey. There are also transit flights to almost all countries.

Bus
There is a daily bus service from Deira, Dubai, UAE to Salalah at 3pm. There is daily bus service between Muscat and Salalah from many bus service providers.

Public transport
Salalah did not have a public transportation system within the city limits until 2018, but in 2019 Sultan Qaboos announced a bus service within the city from Salalah airport to city center and city center to Salalah port.
Oman National Transport Company (Mwasalat) has started daily public bus service in Salalah from December 2018.
Long-distance air-conditioned buses are operated daily from Salalah to Haima, Muscat, Nizwa, Al-Buraimi, Dubai, Al-Ain, Al-Ghaydah, Mukalla, and Seiyun, as well as PDO locations such as Marmul.
Other forms of public transport popular in Salalah are taxis. Generally fares vary from half a Rial to 2 Rials depending on the distance to destination. Taxis are color-coded orange and white and provide semi-personal transportation in the form of both individual hire and the same opportunistic roadway service as Baisa buses, which are not as popular in the city.
Minibuses, colour-coded orange and white, are unmetered like taxis, after several government initiatives to introduce meters were rejected. The fare is set by way of negotiation, although drivers usually adhere to certain unwritten rules for fares within the city. One should always find out the normally accepted fare for one's journey from one's hotel or host before looking for a taxi.

Water transport
The Port of Salalah is one of the deepwater ports in Oman and also eleventh-busiest transshipment port in the world, second-busiest port in the Middle East, which is located at Port Raysut (Salalah).

Raʾs al-Jinz (Arabic: رَأْس ٱلْجِنْز; formerly known as Cape Rosalgate as named by the Portuguese, a corruption of Raʾs al-Hadd; Arabic: رَأْس ٱلْحَدّ) or Raʾs al-Junayz (Arabic: رَأْس ٱلْجُنَيْز), located in Ash-Sharqiyyah South Governorate, Oman, is the easternmost point of the Arabian Peninsula. It is a nesting site for green turtles, as also is the beach at the local village of Ras al Hadd. It is home to a well-known turtle reserve. Important archaeological discoveries have also been made at this site, demonstrating connections to the Indus Valley in ancient times.

Bronze Age harbour
At Ras al-Jinz, since 1985, a Bronze Age (approximately 2200 to 1900 BC) harbour site has been excavated by a Franco-Italian team. There was a large mudbrick building with seven rooms. These rooms opened onto a corridor. The building seems to have served as a manufacturing workshop. There is evidence of processing of shellfish, turtle shell, flint, and the cosmetics, which was extracted from magnesium ore.
Among the finds, about 20% of the ceramics came from the Indus Valley culture. There were also ceramic fragments inscribed with the Indus script symbols.
Among the Indus wares, large ceramic jars were found in Oman. Their presence at Ras Al Jinz is seen as a clear indication of overseas trade. Thus, during the 3d millennium BCE, Oman must have been part of a great trading systems linked with the Indian Ocean. These jars as interpreted as cargo-shipment containers for dry goods being transported over water.

Remains of boats
The discovery of impressed bitumen fragments and slabs at the site provides information on procedures for reed and wooden boat construction. These objects are dated to the mid-3d millennium BCE.
The bitumen pieces carry traces of ropes, reed mats, reed bundles and other details of boat construction. Many of them are also encrusted with sea barnacles. Based on these finds, a mid-3rd millennium 12-m long boat replica was built and tested. These are the indications that this was a Bronze Age port serving the ships from the Indus Valley. Ras al-Jinz still remains an important landmark for merchant ships coming from Pakistan and India.

Metallurgy
Copper smelting and metal working workshops dating to 3000-1200 BCE have also been discovered.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Masirah Island (Arabic: جَزِيْرَة مَصِيْرَة, romanized: Jazīrat Maṣīrah), also referred to as Mazeira Island, is an island off the east coast of mainland Oman in the Arabian Sea, and the largest island of the country. Administratively, it forms one of the five provinces (Wilayah, plural Wilayat) of the Ash Sharqiyah South Governorate, namely Wilāyat Maṣīrah (Arabic: وِلَايَة مَصِيْرَة); previously it was a province of the Ash Sharqiyah Region.
Masirah is 95 km (59 miles) long north–south, between 12 and 14 km (7.5 and 8.7 miles) wide, with an area of about 649 km2, and a population estimated at 12,000 in 12 villages mainly in the north of the island (9,292 as of the census of 2003, of which were 2,311 foreigners). It is divided from the mainland by the Masirah Channel. Most of the island's interior is deserted, with access to the island possible by ferry on National Ferries Company (NFC) or smaller privately owned ferries for cars and passengers. Salam Air also flies to Masirah weekly.
The principal village of Wilayat Masirah is Raʾs-Ḥilf (Arabic: رَأْس حِلْف) in the northern part of the island. It contains a Royal Air Force of Oman air base and a fish factory, as well as a few small towns. Previously, the BBC had a relay facility consisting of both HF and MF broadcasting transmitters stationed there. The main industries are fishing and traditional textile manufacturing. Formerly, traditional shipbuilding was important.

Geography
Located about 19 km (12 miles) off the east side of Barr al Hikman, the island is generally hilly, especially on its east side. The hills along the east side of the island are separated from the island coast by a narrow sandy plain; they run nearly its entire length. A steep plateau stands in the middle of the range on the northeast side of the island. Along the west side of the island, there are a few low hills separated from the east range by an extensive sandy plain marked by several hillocks:

Jabal Madrub, a 256 m (840 ft) high mountain, stands about 13 km (8.1 miles) south of the north end of the island.
Ras Abu Rasas, the south extremity of Al Masirah, is low and rocky. Jabal Suwayr (Jabal al Hilm), a conspicuous conical hill, rises to a height of 153 m (502 ft), about 3 km (1.9 miles) north-northeast of Ras Abu Rasas. It houses the Masirah lighthouse.
Ras Kaydah, a small and rocky headland, has a conspicuous, conical hill about 20 m (66 ft) high nearby. There are small islets 600 m (2,000 ft) east and 4 km (2.5 miles) north of Ras Kayda.
The coast between Ras Kaydah and Ras Zafaranat, about 27 km (17 miles) to the northeast, is regular with a few small rounded projections and a low rocky beach. Haql (Hakkan), a small village in a grove of trees, lies close to the shore about eight km north of Ras Kaydah.
Ras Zafaranat is rocky with hills rising abruptly. Between Ras Abu Rasas and Ras Kaydah, about 18 km (11 miles) to the northeast, the coast is indented by small, sandy bays fringed by rocks.
Ras al-Ya, about 3 km (1.9 miles) northeast of Ras Zafaranat, is the east extremity of the island and consists of a prominent bluff rising to a ridge of hills which extend westward to the center of the island. A conspicuous peak, 99 m (325 ft) high, stands about 3 km (1.9 miles) west-northwest of Ras al-Ya.
Jabal Madrub rises about 5 km (3.1 miles) farther west-northwest.
Ras al-Jazirah, about six km north-northwest of Ras al-Ya, is rocky and well-marked by a black patch on its south side. A sharp peak, rising to a height of 95 m (312 ft), stands about 3 km (1.9 miles) west of this point.
Jazirat Thukhayr, a sandy islet close north of Ras al-Jazirah, lies on a drying reef connected to the shore. Drying rocks extend up to 300 m (980 ft) off the eastern extremity of the islet.
The coast between Ras al Jazirah and Ras Qudufah, the northeast extremity of the island, about 11 km (6.8 miles) further north-northwest, is indented by a bay. Ras Qudufah, consisting of two rocky projections about 800 m (2,600 ft) apart, rises to Jabal al-Jidufa, about 64 m (210 ft) high, a short distance inland. A cairn stands on a hill close south of Jabal al-Jidufa, and a small monument stands close southwest of Ras Qudufah.

Landscape
The rugged terrain of the island and surrounding rough coastline has led to the appearance of many wrecked dhows on the beaches of the island, most of them well preserved by the salt water and intense heat. On 21 September 1835, the USS Peacock grounded on a coral reef.
The ocean bottom environment surrounding Masirah is hostile as the majority of the area is covered in either sand or hard rock. There is a swift current flowing through the area with a very sharp halocline visible on the surface of the ocean. The water depth nearby is around 10 m and is not conducive to side-scan sonar searches due to the shallow water and choppy surface conditions. Despite the poor quality ocean bottom, the area is very productive with marine fisheries, and any hard objects (barrels, engines) are immediately colonised by local fauna.
During summer there is normally a constant strong wind which is ideal for kite and windsurfers. Big waves are a result of the wind on the sea side and is so also attractive for wave surfers. Kite and windsurfers can pick spots around the island according to their skill and what conditions they prefer. On 5–6 June 2007, 7000 people on the island were forced to temporarily leave their homes due to the high storm waves produced by the powerful Cyclone Gonu, the strongest to hit the Persian Gulf region in 60 years.

Ecology
The island is an important hatching ground for loggerhead sea turtles, similar in importance to the beaches at Ras al Hadd and nearby Ras al-Jinz as a hatching ground for green sea turtles. A critically-endangered local population of humpback whales also migrate in the waters surrounding the island and Masirah gulf. The island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports many species of waders and seabirds, as well as Egyptian vultures.

Climate
Saiq has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with hot summers and warm winters. Precipitation is low, and falls mainly from February to April as well as in the brief monsoon season from June to August.

History
Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age archaeological sites are dotted over the island, with one study finding shell middens dating to 6000BC, stone axes from 3000BC and fish line sinkers from 4000BC The Magan Civilization was present, with archaeological records from 2000-2700BC, Indus region pottery shards, and local copper mining in small quantities around 1500BC.
The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a periplus dated to between AD 40 and 70 describes Masirah island, then called Isle of Serapis:

After sailing along it over open water for about 2000 stades from the Isles of Zenobios, you come to the Isle of Sarapis, as it is called, about 120 stades offshore. It is some 200 stades wide and 600 long and is populated by three villages and by holy men of the Ichthyophagi. They use the Arabic tongue and wear loincloths of palm leaves. The island has good supplies of fine-quality tortoise shell.
There was occupation by the Portuguese navy in the sixteenth century. The modern history of the island is little researched, but it is known that the fishermen were accomplished sailors, constructed their own boats, and trade with the mainland was well advanced. In the 1950s the sheikh lived on the East coast at Ra's al Ya.

Military base
The British established a military presence on Masirah in the 1930s. A small stone building, a fuel store for land based aircraft flying between Aden and Muscat, stood at the midpoint of the island on the west side, and had a stone above the door inscribed "RAF 1936".
A dispute between British forces and the local inhabitants took place in 1942, led by one of two local sheikhs, who were eventually forced to flee the island.
During WW II, The British paid the Sultan of Muscat a stipend of £18,000 per annum for affording British forces 'necessary facilities', which included Masirah. A Cabinet Office memorandum of 1945 recommended the acquisition of Masirah on a 99-year lease, US interests in the island notwithstanding (During World War II the United States also had a base on the island.). The Sultan was to be offered an annual payment of £3,750 with an initial premium of £7,500. The base continued to expand into the 1970s, supporting British and Oman forces fighting insurgents during the Dhofar Rebellion and providing transit facilities for long-distance RAF flights.
The British military presence at RAF Masirah extended until 31 March 1977, when Sultan of Oman's Air Force (now the Royal Air Force of Oman) took over the base, which became first SOAF Masirah and then RAFO Masirah.  In the 1970s, the base included a HF communications hub and a rear link to SAS units and british Royal Engineer Units based in Oman in support of the actions against rebels in the south of the country (RAF Salalah). United States' units used Masirah Island as a staging base in Operation Eagle Claw, the unsuccessful 1980 attempt to free US hostages then held in Iran. The island was subsequently used as a staging area for operations into Afghanistan in 2001.
As of 2009, the American private military contractor DynCorp had a contract to staff and serve a US military storage-depot at this base.

Radio Relay Station
In 1966 Masirah took on a new role, it became the base for the British Middle East Relay Station. This was built by the British Diplomatic Wireless Service to be a relay station for the World Service of the BBC. The station had been previously based in Somalia and Perim called the East Africa Relay Station. These stations were both closed as the politics of the region changed. The station was badly damaged by a Hurricane in 1976 but was rebuilt and handed over to the BBC in 1985.

Economy
Historically, the island had copper ore mining dating back to the Bronze Age. The fishing industry, building on a long tradition, is centered on the north coast, and includes a fish processing plant.

Tourism
Masirah Island opened for tourism in the 1990s. One can still only get to the island by ferry, managed by the National Ferry Company, which runs six times a day between Shannah to Masirah.
There are hotels and a kitesurfing camp. For kitesurfers, Masirah is an attractive spot in summer because of the monsoon winds which blow steadily at over 20 knots (37 km/h; 23 mph). Rental cars are available on the island.
