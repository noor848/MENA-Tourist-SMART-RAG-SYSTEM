Cold water from here was taken by the Zaghouan Aqueduct to Carthage. The town is famous for its roses, originally cultivated by Muslim refugees from Spain in the seventeenth century.

It is the capital of the Zaghouan Governorate.\nOn the mountain south of the city is the Roman Water Temple Djebel Zaghouan (Temple de Eaux), source of an aqueduct which used to take water to the city of Carthage over 100 km away. The ruins here are illustrated in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1840, as 'Temple and Fountain of Zagwhan', the painting being by Sir Greenville Temple with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon.\n\nEcclesiastical history\nEtymology\nThe etymology of \"Zaghouan\" is thought to derive from the Andalusian Arabic إِسْطَوَان (Isṭawán), which in turn comes from the Arabic أُسْطُوَانَة (usṭuwānah) meaning 'pillar'. This origin is linked to the settlement of Andalusian Moors in the area at the beginning of the 17th century. In Spanish, the term zaguán refers to a hallway or vestibule, typically serving as a transitional space between the exterior and interior of a building.\nHowever, Zaghouan is the presumed site of the ancient city of Zica or Ziqua, which may have been the source of the modern name. The city was among the many of sufficient importance in the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis to become a suffragan diocese of the Metropolitan of Carthage, in the papal sway, yet was to fade completely, probably at the seventh century advent of Islam.\nIts historically documented bishops were :\n\nDonatist schismatic Donatus attended the Council of Carthage in 411, where his heresy was condemned as such by the Catholic bishops, among whom Zica had no counterpart\nVincentius intervened at the Council of Carthage in 484 called by king Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom, and was afterwards exiled like most Catholic bishops.\n\nClimate\nGallery\nSee also\nList of Catholic dioceses in Tunisia\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources and external links\nGCatholic - (former &) titular see of Zica\nBibliography - Zica bishopric\nJ.
