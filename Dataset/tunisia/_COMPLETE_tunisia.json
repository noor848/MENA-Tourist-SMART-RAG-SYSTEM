          "content": "Carthage (Arabic: قرطاج, ) was an ancient city in Northern Africa, on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis in what is now Tunisia. Carthage was one of the most important trading hubs of the Ancient Mediterranean and one of the most affluent cities of the classical world. It became the capital city of the civilization of Ancient Carthage and later Roman Carthage.\nThe city developed from a Phoenician colony into the capital of a Punic empire which dominated large parts of the Southwest Mediterranean during the first millennium BC. The legendary Queen Elissa, Alyssa or Dido, originally from Tyre, is regarded as the founder of the city, though her historicity has been questioned. In the myth, Dido asked for land from a local tribe, which told her that she could get as much land as an oxhide could cover. She cut the oxhide into strips and laid out the perimeter of the new city. As Carthage prospered at home, the polity sent colonists abroad as well as magistrates to rule the colonies.\nThe ancient city was destroyed in the nearly three year siege of Carthage by the Roman Republic during the Third Punic War in 146 BC. It was re-developed a century later as Roman Carthage, which became the major city of the Roman Empire in the province of Africa. The question of Carthaginian decline and demise has remained a subject of literary, political, artistic, and philosophical debates in both ancient and modern histories.\nLate antique and medieval Carthage continued to play an important cultural and economic role in the Byzantine period. The city was sacked and destroyed by Umayyad forces after the Battle of Carthage in 698 to prevent it from being reconquered by the Byzantine Empire. It remained occupied during the Muslim period and was used as a fort by the Muslims until the Hafsid period when it was taken by the Crusaders with its inhabitants massacred during the Eighth Crusade. The Hafsids decided to destroy its defenses so it could not be used as a base by a hostile power again. It also continued to function as an episcopal see.\nThe regional power shifted to Kairouan and the Medina of Tunis in the medieval period, until the early 20th century, when it began to develop into a coastal suburb of Tunis, incorporated as Carthage municipality in 1919. The archaeological site was first surveyed in 1830, by Danish consul Christian Tuxen Falbe. Excavations were performed in the second half of the 19th century by Charles Ernest Beulé and by Alfred Louis Delattre. The Carthage National Museum was founded in 1875 by Cardinal Charles Lavigerie. Excavations performed by French archaeologists in the 1920s first attracted attention because of the evidence they produced for child sacrifice. There has been considerable disagreement among scholars concerning whether child sacrifice was practiced by ancient Carthage. The open-air Carthage Paleo-Christian Museum has exhibits excavated under the auspices of UNESCO from 1975 to 1984. The site of the ruins is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Carthage ( KAR-thij) is the Early Modern anglicisation of Middle French Carthage /kartaʒə/, from Latin Carthāgō and Karthāgō (cf. Greek Karkhēdōn (Καρχηδών), as well as Karkhadōn (Καρχαδών), and Etruscan *Carθaza) from the Punic qrt-ḥdšt (𐤒𐤓𐤕 𐤇𐤃𐤔𐤕‎) \"new city\", implying it was a \"new Tyre\". The Latin adjective pūnicus, meaning \"Phoenician\", is reflected in English in some borrowings from Latin – notably the Punic Wars and the Punic language.\nThe Modern Standard Arabic form  (قرطاج) is an adoption of French Carthage, replacing an older local toponym reported as Cartagenna that directly continued the Latin name. It also traces back to the Punic name \"Qart-ḥadašt\", meaning \"new city\".\n\nTopography, layout, and society\nOverview\nCarthage was built on a promontory with sea inlets to the north and the south. The city's location made it master of the Mediterranean's maritime trade. All ships crossing the sea had to pass between Sicily and the coast of Tunisia, where Carthage was built, affording it great power and influence. Two large, artificial harbors were built within the city, one for harboring the city's prodigious navy of 220 warships and the other for mercantile trade. A walled tower overlooked both harbors. The city had massive walls, 37 km (23 mi) long, which was longer than the walls of comparable cities. Most of the walls were on the shore and so could be less impressive, as Carthaginian control of the sea made attack from that direction difficult. The 4.0 to 4.8 km (2.5 to 3 mi) of wall on the isthmus to the west were truly massive and were never penetrated.\nCarthage was one of the largest cities of the Hellenistic period and was among the largest cities in preindustrial history. Whereas by AD 14, Rome had at least 750,000 inhabitants and in the following century may have reached 1 million, the cities of Alexandria and Antioch numbered only a few hundred thousand or less. According to the history of Herodian, Carthage rivaled Alexandria for second place in the Roman empire.\n\nLayout\nThe Punic Carthage was divided into four equally sized residential areas with the same layout. It had religious areas, market places, a council house, towers, a theatre, and a huge necropolis; roughly in the middle of the city stood a high citadel called the Byrsa. Surrounding Carthage were walls \"of great strength\" said in places to rise above 13 m, being nearly 10 m thick, according to ancient authors. To the west, three parallel walls were built. The walls altogether ran for about 33 kilometres (21 miles) to encircle the city. The heights of the Byrsa were additionally fortified; this area being the last to succumb to the Romans in 146 BC. Originally the Romans had landed their army on the strip of land extending southward from the city.\nOutside the city walls of Carthage is the Chora or farm lands of Carthage. Chora encompassed a limited area: the north coastal tell, the lower Bagradas river valley (inland from Utica), Cape Bon, and the adjacent sahel on the east coast. Punic culture here achieved the introduction of agricultural sciences first developed for lands of the eastern Mediterranean, and their adaptation to local African conditions.\nThe urban landscape of Carthage is known in part from ancient authors, augmented by modern digs and surveys conducted by archeologists. The \"first urban nucleus\" dating to the seventh century, in area about 10 hectares (25 acres), was apparently located on low-lying lands along the coast (north of the later harbours). As confirmed by archaeological excavations, Carthage was a \"creation ex nihilo\", built on 'virgin' land, and situated at what was then the end of a peninsula. Here among \"mud brick walls and beaten clay floors\" (recently uncovered) were also found extensive cemeteries, which yielded evocative grave goods like clay masks. \"Thanks to this burial archaeology we know more about archaic Carthage than about any other contemporary city in the western Mediterranean.\" Already in the eighth century, fabric dyeing operations had been established, evident from crushed shells of murex (from which the 'Phoenician purple' was derived). Nonetheless, only a \"meager picture\" of the cultural life of the earliest pioneers in the city can be conjectured, and not much about housing, monuments, or defenses. The Roman poet Virgil (70–19 BC) imagined early Carthage, when his legendary character Aeneas had arrived there:\n\n\"Aeneas found, where lately huts had been,\nmarvelous buildings, gateways, cobbled ways,\nand din of wagons. There the Tyrians\nwere hard at work: laying courses for walls,\nrolling up stones to build the citadel,\nwhile others picked out building sites and plowed\na boundary furrow. Laws were being enacted,\nmagistrates and a sacred senate chosen.\nHere men were dredging harbors, there they laid\nthe deep foundations of a theatre,\nand quarried massive pillars... .\"\n\nThe two inner harbors, named cothon in Punic, were located in the southeast; one being commercial, and the other for war. Their definite functions are not entirely known, probably for the construction, outfitting, or repair of ships, perhaps also loading and unloading cargo. Larger anchorages existed to the north and south of the city. North and west of the cothon were located several industrial areas, e.g., metalworking and pottery (e.g., for amphora), which could serve both inner harbors, and ships anchored to the south of the city.\nConsidering the importance of the Byrsa, the citadel area to the north, our knowledge of it is patchy. Its prominent heights were the scene of fierce combat during the fiery destruction of the city in 146 BC. The Byrsa was the reported site of the Temple of Eshmun (the healing god), at the top of a stairway of sixty steps. A temple of Tanit (the city's queen goddess) was likely situated on the slope of the 'lesser Byrsa' immediately to the east, which runs down toward the sea. Also situated on the Byrsa were luxury homes.\nSouth of the citadel, near the cothon was the tophet, a special and very old cemetery, which when begun lay outside the city's boundaries. Here the Salammbô was located, the Sanctuary of Tanit, not a temple but an enclosure for placing stone stelae. These were mostly short and upright, carved for funeral purposes. The presence of infant skeletons from here may indicate the occurrence of child sacrifice, as claimed in the Bible and Greco-Roman sources, although there has been considerable doubt among archeologists as to this interpretation and many consider it simply a cemetery devoted to infants. Probably the tophet burial fields were \"dedicated at an early date, perhaps by the first settlers.\" Recent studies, on the other hand, indicate that child sacrifice was practiced by the Carthaginians.  According to K.L. Noll, many scholars believe that child sacrifice took place in Carthage.\nBetween the sea-filled cothon for shipping and the Byrsa heights lay the agora [Greek: \"market\"], the city-state's central marketplace for business and commerce. The agora was also an area of public squares and plazas, where the people might formally assemble, or gather for festivals. It was the site of religious shrines, and the location of whatever were the major municipal buildings of Carthage. Here beat the heart of civic life. In this district of Carthage, more probably, the ruling suffets presided, the council of elders convened, the tribunal of the 104 met, and justice was dispensed at trials in the open air.\nEarly residential districts wrapped around the Byrsa from the south to the north east. Houses usually were whitewashed and blank to the street, but within were courtyards open to the sky. In these neighborhoods multistory construction later became common, some up to six stories tall according to an ancient Greek author. Several architectural floorplans of homes have been revealed by recent excavations, as well as the general layout of several city blocks. Stone stairs were set in the streets, and drainage was planned, e.g., in the form of soakaways leaching into the sandy soil. Along the Byrsa's southern slope were located not only fine old homes, but also many of the earliest grave-sites, juxtaposed in small areas, interspersed with daily life.\nArtisan workshops were located in the city at sites north and west of the harbours. The location of three metal workshops (implied from iron slag and other vestiges of such activity) were found adjacent to the naval and commercial harbours, and another two were further up the hill toward the Byrsa citadel. Sites of pottery kilns have been identified, between the agora and the harbours, and further north. Earthenware often used Greek models. A fuller's shop for preparing woolen cloth (shrink and thicken) was evidently situated further to the west and south, then by the edge of the city. Carthage also produced objects of rare refinement. During the 4th and 3rd centuries, the sculptures of the sarcophagi became works of art. \"Bronze engraving and stone-carving reached their zenith.\"\nThe elevation of the land at the promontory on the seashore to the north-east (now called Sidi Bou Saïd), was twice as high above sea level as that at the Byrsa (100 m and 50 m). In between runs a ridge, several times reaching 50 m; it continues northwestward along the seashore, and forms the edge of a plateau-like area between the Byrsa and the sea. Newer urban developments lay here in these northern districts.\n\nDue to the Roman's leveling of the city, the original Punic urban landscape of Carthage was largely lost. Since 1982, French archaeologist Serge Lancel excavated a residential area of the Punic Carthage on top of Byrsa hill near the Forum of the Roman Carthage. The neighborhood can be dated back to early second century BC, and with its houses, shops, and private spaces, is significant for what it reveals about daily life of the Punic Carthage.\nThe remains have been preserved under embankments, the substructures of the later Roman forum, whose foundation piles dot the district. The housing blocks are separated by a grid of straight streets about 6 m (20 ft) wide, with a roadway consisting of clay; in situ stairs compensate for the slope of the hill. Construction of this type presupposes organization and political will, and has inspired the name of the neighborhood, \"Hannibal district\", referring to the legendary Punic general or sufet (consul) at the beginning of the second century BC. The habitat is typical, even stereotypical. The street was often used as a storefront/shopfront; cisterns were installed in basements to collect water for domestic use, and a long corridor on the right side of each residence led to a courtyard containing a sump, around which various other elements may be found. In some places, the ground is covered with mosaics called punica pavement, sometimes using a characteristic red mortar.\n\nSociety and local economy\nPunic culture and agricultural sciences, after arriving at Carthage from the eastern Mediterranean, gradually adapted to the local conditions. The merchant harbor at Carthage was developed after settlement of the nearby Punic town of Utica, and eventually the surrounding African countryside was brought into the orbit of the Punic urban centers, first commercially, then politically. Direct management over cultivation of neighbouring lands by Punic owners followed. A 28-volume work on agriculture written in Punic by Mago, a retired army general (c. 300), was translated into Latin and later into Greek. The original and both translations have been lost; however, some of Mago's text has survived in other Latin works. Olive trees (e.g., grafting), fruit trees (pomegranate, almond, fig, date palm), viniculture, bees, cattle, sheep, poultry, implements, and farm management were among the ancient topics which Mago discussed. As well, Mago addresses the wine-maker's art (here a type of sherry).\nIn Punic farming society, according to Mago, the small estate owners were the chief producers. They were, two modern historians write, not absent landlords. Rather, the likely reader of Mago was \"the master of a relatively modest estate, from which, by great personal exertion, he extracted the maximum yield.\" Mago counselled the rural landowner, for the sake of their own 'utilitarian' interests, to treat carefully and well their managers and farm workers, or their overseers and slaves. Yet elsewhere these writers suggest that rural land ownership provided also a new power base among the city's nobility, for those resident in their country villas. By many, farming was viewed as an alternative endeavour to an urban business. Another modern historian opines that more often it was the urban merchant of Carthage who owned rural farming land to some profit, and also to retire there during the heat of summer. It may seem that Mago anticipated such an opinion, and instead issued this contrary advice (as quoted by the Roman writer Columella):\n\nThe man who acquires an estate must sell his house, lest he prefer to live in the town rather than in the country. Anyone who prefers to live in a town has no need of an estate in the country.\" \"One who has bought land should sell his town house, so that he will have no desire to worship the household gods of the city rather than those of the country; the man who takes greater delight in his city residence will have no need of a country estate.\nThe issues involved in rural land management also reveal underlying features of Punic society, its structure and stratification. The hired workers might be considered 'rural proletariat', drawn from the local Berbers. Whether there remained Berber landowners next to Punic-run farms is unclear. Some Berbers became sharecroppers. Slaves acquired for farm work were often prisoners of war. In lands outside Punic political control, independent Berbers cultivated grain and raised horses on their lands. Yet within the Punic domain that surrounded the city-state of Carthage, there were ethnic divisions in addition to the usual quasi feudal distinctions between lord and peasant, or master and serf. This inherent instability in the countryside drew the unwanted attention of potential invaders. Yet for long periods Carthage was able to manage these social difficulties.\nThe many amphorae with Punic markings subsequently found about ancient Mediterranean coastal settlements testify to Carthaginian trade in locally made olive oil and wine. Carthage's agricultural production was held in high regard by the ancients, and rivaled that of Rome – they were once competitors, e.g., over their olive harvests. Under Roman rule, however, grain production (wheat and barley) for export increased dramatically in 'Africa'; yet these later fell with the rise in Roman Egypt's grain exports. Thereafter olive groves and vineyards were re-established around Carthage. Visitors to the several growing regions that surrounded the city wrote admiringly of the lush green gardens, orchards, fields, irrigation channels, hedgerows (as boundaries), as well as the many prosperous farming towns located across the rural landscape.\nAccordingly, the Greek author and compiler Diodorus Siculus (fl. 1st century BC), who enjoyed access to ancient writings later lost, and on which he based most of his writings, described agricultural land near the city of Carthage c. 310 BC:\n\nIt was divided into market gardens and orchards of all sorts of fruit trees, with many streams of water flowing in channels irrigating every part. There were country homes everywhere, lavishly built and covered with stucco. ... Part of the land was planted with vines, part with olives and other productive trees. Beyond these, cattle and sheep were pastured on the plains, and there were meadows with grazing horses.\n\nAncient history\nGreek cities contested with Carthage for the Western Mediterranean culminating in the Sicilian Wars and the Pyrrhic War over Sicily, while the Romans fought three wars against Carthage, known as the Punic Wars, from the Latin \"Punicus\" meaning \"Phoenician\", as Carthage was a Phoenician colony grown into an empire.\n\nPunic Republic\nThe Carthaginian republic was one of the longest-lived and largest states in the ancient Mediterranean. Reports relay several wars with Syracuse and finally, Rome, which eventually resulted in the defeat and destruction of Carthage in the Third Punic War. The Carthaginians were Phoenician settlers of primarily Southern Mediterranean and Southern European ancestry. Phoenicians had originated in the Mediterranean coast of the Levant. They spoke Canaanite, a Semitic language, and followed a local variety of the ancient Canaanite religion, the Punic religion. The Carthaginians travelled widely across the seas and set up numerous colonies. Unlike Greek, Phoenician, and Tyrian colonizers who \"only required colonies to pay due respect for their home-cities\", Carthage is said to have \"sent its own magistrates to govern overseas settlements\".\n\nThe fall of Carthage came at the end of the Third Punic War in 146 BC at the Battle of Carthage. Despite initial devastating Roman naval losses and Hannibal's 15-year occupation of much of Roman Italy, who was on the brink of defeat but managed to recover, the end of the series of wars resulted in the end of Carthaginian power and the complete destruction of the city by Scipio Aemilianus. The Romans pulled the Phoenician warships out into the harbor and burned them before the city, and went from house to house, capturing and enslaving the people. About 50,000 Carthaginians were sold into slavery. The city was set ablaze and razed to the ground, leaving only ruins and rubble. After the fall of Carthage, Rome annexed the majority of the Carthaginian colonies, including other North African locations such as Volubilis, Lixus, and Chellah. Today a \"Carthaginian peace\" can refer to any brutal peace treaty demanding total subjugation of the defeated side.\n\nSalting legend\nSince at least 1863, it has been claimed that Carthage was sown with salt after being razed, but there is no evidence for this.\n\nRoman Carthage\nWhen Carthage fell, its nearby rival Utica, a Roman ally, was made capital of the region and replaced Carthage as the leading center of Punic trade and leadership. It had the advantageous position of being situated on the outlet of the Medjerda River, Tunisia's only river that flowed all year long. However, grain cultivation in the Tunisian mountains caused large amounts of silt to erode into the river. This silt accumulated in the harbor until it became useless, and Rome was forced to rebuild Carthage.\nBy 122 BC, Gaius Gracchus founded a short-lived colony, called Colonia Iunonia, after the Latin name for the Punic goddess Tanit, Iuno Caelestis. The purpose was to obtain arable lands for impoverished farmers. The Senate abolished the colony some time later, to undermine Gracchus' power.\nAfter this ill-fated effort, a new city of Carthage was built on the same land by Julius Caesar in the period from 49 to 44 BC, and by the first century, it had grown to be the second-largest city in the western half of the Roman Empire, with a peak population of 500,000. It was the center of the province of Africa, which was a major breadbasket of the Empire. Among its major monuments was an amphitheater.\nCarthage also became a center of early Christianity (see Carthage (episcopal see)). In the first of a string of rather poorly reported councils at Carthage a few years later, no fewer than 70 bishops attended. Tertullian later broke with the mainstream that was increasingly represented in the West by the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, but a more serious rift among Christians was the Donatist controversy, against which Augustine of Hippo spent much time and parchment arguing. At the Council of Carthage (397), the biblical canon for the western Church was confirmed. The Christians at Carthage conducted persecutions against the pagans, during which the pagan temples, notably the famous Temple of Juno Caelesti, were destroyed.\n\nThe Vandals under Gaiseric invaded Africa in 429. They relinquished the facade of their allied status to Rome and defeated the Roman general Bonifacius to seize Carthage, the once most treasured province of Rome. The 5th-century Roman bishop Victor Vitensis mentions in his Historia Persecutionis Africanae Provincia that the Vandals destroyed parts of Carthage, including various buildings and churches. Once the Vandals were in power, the ecclesiastical authorities were persecuted, the locals were aggressively taxed, and naval raids were routinely launched on Romans in the Mediterranean.\nAfter a failed attempt to recapture the city in the fifth century, the Eastern Roman Empire finally subdued the Vandals in the Vandalic War in 533–534 and made Carthage capital of Byzantine North Africa. Thereafter, the city became the seat of the praetorian prefecture of Africa, which was made into an exarchate during the emperor Maurice's reign, as was Ravenna on the Italian Peninsula. These two exarchates were the western bulwarks of the Byzantine Empire, all that remained of its power in the West. In the early seventh century Heraclius the Elder, the exarch of Carthage, overthrew the Byzantine emperor Phocas, whereupon his son Heraclius succeeded to the imperial throne.\n\nIslamic period\nThe Roman Exarchate of Africa was not able to withstand the seventh-century Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. The Umayyad Caliphate under Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan in 686 sent a force led by Zuhayr ibn Qays, who won a battle over the Romans and Berbers led by King Kusaila of the Kingdom of Altava on the plain of Kairouan, but he could not follow that up. In 695, Hassan ibn al-Nu'man captured Carthage and advanced into the Atlas Mountains. An imperial fleet arrived and retook Carthage, but in 698, Hasan ibn al-Nu'man returned and defeated Emperor Tiberios III at the 698 Battle of Carthage. Roman imperial forces withdrew from all of Africa except Ceuta. Fearing that the Byzantine Empire might reconquer it, they decided to destroy Roman Carthage in a scorched earth policy and establish their headquarters somewhere else. Its walls were torn down, the water supply from its aqueducts cut off, the agricultural land was ravaged and its harbors made unusable.\nThe destruction of the Exarchate of Africa marked a permanent end to the Byzantine Empire's influence in the region.\nIt is clear from archaeological evidence that the town of Carthage continued to be occupied, as did the neighborhood of Bjordi Djedid. The Baths of Antoninus continued to function in the Arab period and the eleventh-century historian Al-Bakri stated that they were still in good condition at that time. They also had production centers nearby. It is difficult to determine whether the continued habitation of some other buildings belonged to Late Byzantine or Early Arab period. The Bir Ftouha church may have continued to remain in use although it is not clear when it became uninhabited. Constantine the African was born in Carthage.\nThe Medina of Tunis, originally a Berber settlement, was established as the new regional center under the Umayyad Caliphate in the early 8th century. Under the Aghlabids, the people of Tunis revolted numerous times, but the city profited from economic improvements and quickly became the second most important in the kingdom. It was briefly the national capital, from the end of the reign of Ibrahim II in 902, until 909, when the Shi'ite Berbers took over Ifriqiya and founded the Fatimid Caliphate.\nCarthage remained a residential see until the high medieval period, and is mentioned in two letters of Pope Leo IX dated 1053, written in reply to consultations regarding a conflict between the bishops of Carthage and Gummi. In each of the two letters, Pope Leo declares that, after the Bishop of Rome, the first archbishop and chief metropolitan of the whole of Africa is the bishop of Carthage. Later, an archbishop of Carthage named Cyriacus was imprisoned by the Arab rulers because of an accusation by some Christians. Pope Gregory VII wrote Cyriacus a letter of consolation, repeating the hopeful assurances of the primacy of the Church of Carthage, \"whether the Church of Carthage should still lie desolate or rise again in glory\". By 1076, Cyriacus was set free, but there was only one other bishop in the province. These are the last of whom there is mention in that period of the history of the see.\nThe fortress of Carthage was used by the Muslims until Hafsid era and was captured by the Crusaders during the Eighth Crusade. The inhabitants of Carthage were slaughtered by the Crusaders after they took it, and it was used as a base of operations against the Hafsids. After repelling them, Muhammad I al-Mustansir decided to raze Cathage's defenses in order to prevent a repeat.\n\nModern history\nCarthage is some 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) east-northeast of Tunis; the settlements nearest to Carthage were the town of Sidi Bou Said to the north and the village of Le Kram to the south. Sidi Bou Said was a village which had grown around the tomb of the eponymous sufi saint (d. 1231), which had been developed into a town under Ottoman rule in the 18th century. Le Kram was developed in the late 19th century under French administration as a settlement close to the port of La Goulette.\nIn 1881, Tunisia became a French protectorate, and in the same year Charles Lavigerie, who was archbishop of Algiers, became apostolic administrator of the vicariate of Tunis. In the following year, Lavigerie became a cardinal. He \"saw himself as the reviver of the ancient Christian Church of Africa, the Church of Cyprian of Carthage\", and, on 10 November 1884, was successful in his great ambition of having the metropolitan see of Carthage restored, with himself as its first archbishop. In line with the declaration of Pope Leo IX in 1053, Pope Leo XIII acknowledged the revived Archdiocese of Carthage as the primatial see of Africa and Lavigerie as primate.\nThe Acropolium of Carthage (Saint Louis Cathedral of Carthage) was erected on Byrsa hill in 1884.\n\nArchaeological sites\nThe Danish consul Christian Tuxen Falbe conducted a first survey of the topography of the archaeological site (published in 1833).\nAntiquarian interest was intensified following the publication of Flaubert's Salammbô in 1858. Charles Ernest Beulé performed some preliminary excavations of Roman remains on Byrsa hill in 1860. In 1866, Muhammad Khaznadar, the son of the Prime Minister of Tunisia, carried out the first locally led excavations. A more systematic survey of both Punic and Roman-era remains is due to Alfred Louis Delattre, who was sent to Tunis by cardinal Charles Lavigerie in 1875 on both an apostolic and an archaeological mission.\nAudollent cites Delattre and Lavigerie to the effect that in the 1880s, locals still knew the area of the ancient city under the name of Cartagenna (i.e. reflecting the Latin n-stem Carthāgine).\nAuguste Audollent divided the area of Roman Carthage into four quarters, Cartagenna, Dermèche, Byrsa and La Malga. Cartagenna and Dermèche correspond with the lower city, including the site of Punic Carthage; Byrsa is associated with the upper city, which in Punic times was a walled citadel above the harbour; and La Malga is linked with the more remote parts of the upper city in Roman times.\nFrench-led excavations at Carthage began in 1921, and from 1923 reported finds of a large quantity of urns containing a mixture of animal and children's bones. René Dussaud identified a 4th-century BC stela found in Carthage as depicting a child sacrifice.\nA temple at Amman (1400–1250 BC) excavated and reported upon by J.B. Hennessy in 1966, shows the possibility of bestial and human sacrifice by fire. While evidence of child sacrifice in Canaan was the object of academic disagreement, with some scholars arguing that merely children's cemeteries had been unearthed in Carthage, the mixture of children's with animal bones as well as associated epigraphic evidence involving mention of mlk led some to believe that, at least in Carthage, child sacrifice was indeed common practice. However, though the animals were surely sacrificed, this does not entirely indicate that the infants were, and in fact the bones indicate the opposite. Rather, the animal sacrifice was likely done to, in some way, honour the deceased.\nA study conducted in 1970 by M. Chabeuf, the then Doctor of Science from the University of Paris, showed little difference between 17 modern Tunisians, and 68 Punic remains. An analysis the following year on 42 North-West African skulls dating back to Roman times concluded that they were overall similar to modern Berbers and other Mediterranean populations, especially eastern Iberians. They also noted the presence of one outlier in Tunisia who appears to have inherited mechtoid traits, which led them to hypothesize the persistence of such affinities well into the Punic and Roman era.\nM. C. Chamla and D Ferembach (1988) in their entry dealing with the craniometric conclusions of Protohistorical Algerians and Punics in the region of Tunisia, found strong sexual dimorphism with male skulls being robust. Mediterranean elements were dominant, but Mechtoid features, as well as 'Negroid' traits were present in some of the samples. Overall, Punic burials showed affinities with Algerians, Roman Era skulls from Tarragona (Spain), Guanches, and to a lesser extent Abydos (XVIIIth dynasty), Etruscans, Bronze Age Syrians (Euphrates) and skulls from Lozere (France). The anthropological position of the Algerian and Punic people when it comes to populations of the Mediterranean Basin agreed quite well with the geographical situation.\nJehan Desanges stated that \"In the Punic burial grounds, negroid remains were not rare and there were black auxiliaries in the Carthaginian army who were certainly not Nilotics\".\nIn 1990, Shomarka Keita, a biological anthropologist, had conducted a craniometric study which featured a set of remains from Northern Africa. He examined a sample of 49 Maghreban crania which included skulls from pre-Roman Carthage and concluded that, although they were heterogeneous, many of them showed physical similarities to crania from equatorial Africa, ancient Egypt, and Kush; with most having traits conforming to the northern (Lower) Egyptian pattern. S.O.Y. Keita's later report in 2018, found the pre-Roman Carthaginian series to be intermediate between the Phoenician and Maghreban. He noted the findings are consistent with an interpretation that it reflects both local and Levantine ancestry due to specific interactions in the ancient period.\nJoel. D. Irish, when measuring for dental affinities in 2001, found strong similarities and very small distances between the Canary Islanders and Punic Carthaginians (who originated in West Asia), suggesting a particularly close affinity, despite the geographic distance between these two populations. This result according to Irish, may reflect Berber/Carthaginian admixture. Overall, the findings discovered that \"the Canary Island sample is most similar to the four samples from Northwest Africa: the Shawia Berbers, Kabyle Berbers, Bedouin Arabs and Carthaginians, less similar to the three Egyptian samples and least like the three Nubian samples.\"\nIn 2016, an ancient Carthaginian individual, who was excavated from a Punic tomb in Byrsa Hill, was found to belong to the rare U5b2c1 maternal haplogroup. The Young Man of Byrsa specimen dates from the late 6th century BC, and his lineage is believed to represent early gene flow from Iberia to the Maghreb. Craniometric analysis of the young man indicated likely Mediterranean/European ancestry as opposed to African or Asian.\n\nClimate change\nDue to its coastal location, Carthage Archeological Site is vulnerable to sea level rise. In 2022, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report included it in the list of African cultural sites which would be threatened by flooding and coastal erosion by the end of the century, but only if climate change followed RCP 8.5, which is the scenario of high and continually increasing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the warming of over 4 °C (7.2 °F), and is no longer considered very likely. The other, more plausible scenarios result in lower warming levels and consequently lower sea level rise: yet, sea levels would continue to increase for about 10,000 years under all of them. Even if the warming is limited to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F), global sea level rise is still expected to exceed 2–3 m (7–10 ft) after 2,000 years (and higher warming levels will see larger increases by then), consequently exceeding 2,100 levels of sea level rise under RCP 8.5 (~0.75 m (2 ft) with a range of 0.5–1 m (2–3 ft)) well before the year 4000. Thus, it is a matter of time before the Carthage Archeological Site is threatened by rising water levels, unless it can be protected by adaptation efforts such as sea walls.\n\nCommune\nThe commune of Carthage was created by a decree of the Bey of Tunis on 15 June 1919, during the rule of Naceur Bey.\nIn 1920, the first seaplane base was built on the Lake of Tunis for the seaplanes of Compagnie Aéronavale. The Tunis Airfield opened in 1938, serving around 5,800 passengers annually on the Paris-Tunis route.\nDuring World War II, the airport was used by the United States Army Air Force Twelfth Air Force as a headquarters and command control base for the Italian Campaign of 1943.\nConstruction on the Tunis-Carthage Airport, which was fully funded by France, began in 1944, and in 1948 the airport become the main hub for Tunisair.\nIn the 1950s the Lycée Français de Carthage was established to serve French families in Carthage. In 1961 it was given to the Tunisian government as part of the Independence of Tunisia, so the nearby Collège Maurice Cailloux in La Marsa, previously an annex of the Lycée Français de Carthage, was renamed to the Lycée Français de La Marsa and began serving the lycée level. It is currently the Lycée Gustave Flaubert.\nAfter Tunisian independence in 1956, the Tunis conurbation gradually extended around the airport, and Carthage (قرطاج Qarṭāj) is now a suburb of Tunis, covering the area between Sidi Bou Said and Le Kram. Its population as of January 2013 was estimated at 21,276,\nmostly attracting the more wealthy residents. If Carthage is not the capital, it tends to be the political pole, a \"place of emblematic power\" according to Sophie Bessis, leaving to Tunis the economic and administrative roles. The Carthage Palace (the Tunisian presidential palace) is located in the coast.\nThe suburb has six train stations of the TGM line between Le Kram and Sidi Bou Said:\nCarthage Salammbo (named for the ancient children's cemetery where it stands), Carthage Byrsa (named for Byrsa hill), Carthage Dermech (Dermèche), Carthage Hannibal (named for Hannibal), Carthage Présidence (named for the Presidential Palace) and Carthage Amilcar (named for Hamilcar).\n\nTrade and business\nThe merchants of Carthage were in part heirs of the Mediterranean trade developed by Phoenicia, and so also heirs of the rivalry with Greek merchants. Business activity was accordingly both stimulated and challenged. Cyprus had been an early site of such commercial contests. The Phoenicians then had ventured into the western Mediterranean, founding trading posts, including Utica and Carthage. The Greeks followed, entering the western seas where the commercial rivalry continued. Eventually it would lead, especially in Sicily, to several centuries of intermittent war. Although Greek-made merchandise was generally considered superior in design, Carthage also produced trade goods in abundance. That Carthage came to function as a manufacturing colossus was shown during the Third Punic War with Rome. Carthage, which had previously disarmed, then was made to face the fatal Roman siege. The city \"suddenly organised the manufacture of arms\" with great skill and effectiveness. According to Strabo (63 BC – AD 21) in his Geographica:\n\n[Carthage] each day produced one hundred and forty finished shields, three hundred swords, five hundred spears, and one thousand missiles for the catapults... . Furthermore, [Carthage although surrounded by the Romans] built one hundred and twenty decked ships in two months... for old timber had been stored away in readiness, and a large number of skilled workmen, maintained at public expense.\nThe textile industry in Carthage probably started in private homes, but the existence of professional weavers indicates that a sort of factory system later developed. Products included embroidery, carpets, and use of the purple murex dye (for which the Carthaginian isle of Djerba was famous). Metalworkers developed specialized skills, i.e., making various weapons for the armed forces, as well as domestic articles, such as knives, forks, scissors, mirrors, and razors (all articles found in tombs). Artwork in metals included vases and lamps in bronze, also bowls, and plates. Other products came from such crafts as the potters, the glassmakers, and the goldsmiths. Inscriptions on votive stele indicate that many were not slaves but 'free citizens'.\n\nPhoenician and Punic merchant ventures were often run as a family enterprise, putting to work its members and its subordinate clients. Such family-run businesses might perform a variety of tasks: own and maintain the ships, providing the captain and crew; do the negotiations overseas, either by barter or buying and selling, of their own manufactured commodities and trade goods, and native products (metals, foodstuffs, etc.) to carry and trade elsewhere; and send their agents to stay at distant outposts in order to make lasting local contacts, and later to establish a warehouse of shipped goods for exchange, and eventually perhaps a settlement. Over generations, such activity might result in the creation of a wide-ranging network of trading operations. Ancillary would be the growth of reciprocity between different family firms, foreign and domestic.\nState protection was extended to its sea traders by the Phoenician city of Tyre and later likewise by the daughter city-state of Carthage. Stéphane Gsell, the well-regarded French historian of ancient North Africa, summarized the major principles guiding the civic rulers of Carthage with regard to its policies for trade and commerce:\n\nto open and maintain markets for its merchants, whether by entering into direct contact with foreign peoples using either treaty negotiations or naval power, or by providing security for isolated trading stations\nthe reservation of markets exclusively for the merchants of Carthage, or where competition could not be eliminated, to regulate trade by state-sponsored agreements with its commercial rivals\nsuppression of piracy, and promotion of Carthage's ability to freely navigate the seas\nBoth the Phoenicians and the Carthaginians were well known in antiquity for their secrecy in general, and especially pertaining to commercial contacts and trade routes. Both cultures excelled in commercial dealings. Strabo (63 BC – AD 21), the Greek geographer, wrote that before its fall (in 146 BC) Carthage enjoyed a population of 700,000 and directed an alliance of 300 cities. The Greek historian Polybius (c. 203–120) referred to Carthage as \"the wealthiest city in the world\".\n\nConstitution of state\nA \"suffet\" (possibly two) was elected by the citizens, and held office with no military power for a one-year term. Carthaginian generals marshalled mercenary armies and were separately elected. From about 550 to 450 the Magonid family monopolized the top military position; later the Barcid family acted similarly. Eventually it came to be that, after a war, the commanding general had to testify justifying his actions before a court of 104 judges.\nAristotle (384–322) discusses Carthage in his work, Politica; he begins: \"The Carthaginians are also considered to have an excellent form of government.\" He briefly describes the city as a \"mixed constitution\", a political arrangement with cohabiting elements of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, i.e., a king (Gk: basileus), a council of elders (Gk: gerusia), and the people (Gk: demos). Later Polybius of Megalopolis (c. 204–122, Greek) in his Histories would describe the Roman Republic in more detail as a mixed constitution in which the Consuls were the monarchy, the Senate the aristocracy, and the Assemblies the democracy.\nEvidently Carthage also had an institution of elders who advised the Suffets, similar to a Greek gerusia or the Roman Senate. We do not have a Punic name for this body. At times its members would travel with an army general on campaign. Members also formed permanent committees. The institution had several hundred members drawn from the wealthiest class who held office for life. Vacancies were probably filled by recruitment from among the elite, i.e., by co-option. From among its members were selected the 104 Judges mentioned above. Later the 104 would come to evaluate not only army generals but other office holders as well. Aristotle regarded the 104 as most important; he compared it to the ephorate of Sparta with regard to control over security. In Hannibal's time, such a Judge held office for life. At some stage there also came to be independent self-perpetuating boards of five who filled vacancies and supervised (non-military) government administration.\nPopular assemblies also existed at Carthage. When deadlocked the Suffets and the quasi-senatorial institution of elders might request the assembly to vote; also, assembly votes were requested in very crucial matters in order to achieve political consensus and popular coherence. The assembly members had no legal wealth or birth qualification. How its members were selected is unknown, e.g., whether by festival group or urban ward or another method.\nThe Greeks were favourably impressed by the constitution of Carthage; Aristotle had a separate study of it made, which is lost. In his Politica he states: \"The government of Carthage is oligarchical, but they successfully escape the evils of oligarchy by enriching one portion of the people after another by sending them to their colonies.\" \"[T]heir policy is to send some [poorer citizens] to their dependent towns, where they grow rich.\" Yet Aristotle continues, \"[I]f any misfortune occurred, and the bulk of the subjects revolted, there would be no way of restoring peace by legal means.\" Aristotle remarked also:\n\nMany of the Carthaginian institutions are excellent. The superiority of their constitution is proved by the fact that the common people remain loyal to the constitution; the Carthaginians have never had any rebellion worth speaking of, and have never been under the rule of a tyrant.\nThe city-state of Carthage, whose citizens were mainly Libyphoenicians (of Phoenician ancestry born in Africa), dominated and exploited an agricultural countryside composed mainly of native Berber sharecroppers and farmworkers, whose affiliations to Carthage were open to divergent possibilities. Beyond these more settled Berbers and the Punic farming towns and rural manors, lived the independent Berber tribes, who were mostly pastoralists.\nIn the brief, uneven review of government at Carthage found in his Politica Aristotle mentions several faults. Thus, \"that the same person should hold many offices, which is a favorite practice among the Carthaginians.\" Aristotle disapproves, mentioning the flute-player and the shoemaker. Also, that \"magistrates should be chosen not only for their merit but for their wealth.\" Aristotle's opinion is that focus on pursuit of wealth will lead to oligarchy and its evils.\n\n[S]urely it is a bad thing that the greatest offices... should be bought. The law which allows this abuse makes wealth of more account than virtue, and the whole state becomes avaricious. For, whenever the chiefs of the state deem anything honorable, the other citizens are sure to follow their example; and, where virtue has not the first place, their aristocracy cannot be firmly established.\nIn Carthage the people seemed politically satisfied and submissive, according to the historian Warmington. They in their assemblies only rarely exercised the few opportunities given them to assent to state decisions. Popular influence over government appears not to have been an issue at Carthage. Being a commercial republic fielding a mercenary army, the people were not conscripted for military service, an experience which can foster the feel for popular political action. But perhaps this misunderstands the society; perhaps the people, whose values were based on small-group loyalty, felt themselves sufficiently connected to their city's leadership by the very integrity of the person-to-person linkage within their social fabric. Carthage was very stable; there were few openings for tyrants. Only after defeat by Rome devastated Punic imperial ambitions did the people of Carthage seem to question their governance and to show interest in political reform.\nIn 196, following the Second Punic War (218–201), Hannibal, still greatly admired as a Barcid military leader, was elected suffet. When his reforms were blocked by a financial official about to become a judge for life, Hannibal rallied the populace against the 104 judges. He proposed a one-year term for the 104, as part of a major civic overhaul. Additionally, the reform included a restructuring of the city's revenues, and the fostering of trade and agriculture. The changes rather quickly resulted in a noticeable increase in prosperity. Yet his incorrigible political opponents cravenly went to Rome, to charge Hannibal with conspiracy, namely, plotting war against Rome in league with Antiochus the Hellenic ruler of Syria. Although the Roman Scipio Africanus resisted such manoeuvre, eventually intervention by Rome forced Hannibal to leave Carthage. Thus, corrupt city officials efficiently blocked Hannibal in his efforts to reform the government of Carthage.\nMago (6th century) was King of Carthage; the head of state, war leader, and religious figurehead. His family was considered to possess a sacred quality. Mago's office was somewhat similar to that of a pharaoh, but although kept in a family it was not hereditary, it was limited by legal consent. Picard, accordingly, believes that the council of elders and the popular assembly are late institutions. Carthage was founded by the king of Tyre who had a royal monopoly on this trading venture. Thus it was the royal authority stemming from this traditional source of power that the King of Carthage possessed. Later, as other Phoenician ship companies entered the trading region, and so associated with the city-state, the King of Carthage had to keep order among a rich variety of powerful merchants in their negotiations among themselves and over risky commerce across the Mediterranean. Under these circumstance, the office of king began to be transformed. Yet it was not until the aristocrats of Carthage became wealthy owners of agricultural lands in Africa that a council of elders was institutionalized at Carthage.\n\nContemporary sources\nMost ancient literature concerning Carthage comes from Greek and Roman sources as Carthage's own documents were destroyed by the Romans. Apart from inscriptions, hardly any Punic literature has survived, and none in its own language and script. A brief catalogue would include:\n\nthree short treaties with Rome (Latin translations);\nseveral pages of Hanno the Navigator's log-book concerning his fifth century maritime exploration of the Atlantic coast of west Africa (Greek translation);\nfragments quoted from Mago's fourth/third century 28-volume treatise on agriculture (Latin translations);\nthe Roman playwright Plautus (c. 250 – 184) in his Poenulus incorporates a few fictional speeches delivered in Punic, whose written lines are transcribed into Latin letters phonetically;\nthe thousands of inscriptions made in Punic script, thousands, but many extremely short, e.g., a dedication to a deity with the personal name(s) of the devotee(s).\n\"[F]rom the Greek author Plutarch [(c. 46 – c. 120)] we learn of the 'sacred books' in Punic safeguarded by the city's temples. Few Punic texts survive, however.\" Once \"the City Archives, the Annals, and the scribal lists of Suffets\" existed, but evidently these were destroyed in the horrific fires during the Roman capture of the city in 146 BC.\nYet some Punic books (Latin: libri punici) from the libraries of Carthage reportedly did survive the fires. These works were apparently given by Roman authorities to the newly augmented Berber rulers. Over a century after the fall of Carthage, the Roman politician-turned-author Gaius Sallustius Crispus or Sallust (86–34) reported his having seen volumes written in Punic, which books were said to be once possessed by the Berber king, Hiempsal II (r. 88–81). By way of Berber informants and Punic translators, Sallust had used these surviving books to write his brief sketch of Berber affairs.\n\nProbably some of Hiempsal II's libri punici, that had escaped the fires that consumed Carthage in 146 BC, wound up later in the large royal library of his grandson Juba II (r. 25 BC–AD 24). Juba II not only was a Berber king, and husband of Cleopatra's daughter, but also a scholar and author in Greek of no less than nine works. He wrote for the Mediterranean-wide audience then enjoying classical literature. The libri punici inherited from his grandfather surely became useful to him when composing his Libyka, a work on North Africa written in Greek. Only fragments of Libyka survive, mostly from quotations made by other ancient authors. It may have been Juba II who 'discovered' the five-centuries-old 'log book' of Hanno the Navigator, called the Periplus, among library documents saved from fallen Carthage.\nIn the end, however, most Punic writings that survived the destruction of Carthage \"did not escape the immense wreckage in which so many of Antiquity's literary works perished.\" Accordingly, the long and continuous interactions between Punic citizens of Carthage and the Berber communities that surrounded the city have no local historian. Their political arrangements and periodic crises, their economic and work life, the cultural ties and social relations established and nourished (infrequently as kin), are not known to us directly from ancient Punic authors in written accounts. Neither side has left us their stories about life in Punic-era Carthage.\nRegarding Phoenician writings, few remain and these seldom refer to Carthage. The more ancient and most informative are cuneiform tablets, c. 1600–1185, from ancient Ugarit, located to the north of Phoenicia on the Syrian coast; it was a Canaanite city politically affiliated with the Hittites. The clay tablets tell of myths, epics, rituals, medical and administrative matters, and also correspondence. The highly valued works of Sanchuniathon, an ancient priest of Beirut, who reportedly wrote on Phoenician religion and the origins of civilization, are themselves completely lost, but some little content endures twice removed. Sanchuniathon was said to have lived in the 11th century, which is considered doubtful. Much later a Phoenician History by Philo of Byblos (64–141) reportedly existed, written in Greek, but only fragments of this work survive. An explanation proffered for why so few Phoenician works endured: early on (11th century) archives and records began to be kept on papyrus, which does not long survive in a moist coastal climate. Also, both Phoenicians and Carthaginians were well known for their secrecy.\nThus, of their ancient writings we have little of major interest left to us by Carthage, or by Phoenicia the country of origin of the city founders. \"Of the various Phoenician and Punic compositions alluded to by the ancient classical authors, not a single work or even fragment has survived in its original idiom.\" \"Indeed, not a single Phoenician manuscript has survived in the original [language] or in translation.\" We cannot therefore access directly the line of thought or the contour of their worldview as expressed in their own words, in their own voice. Ironically, it was the Phoenicians who \"invented or at least perfected and transmitted a form of writing [the alphabet] that has influenced dozens of cultures including our own.\"\nAs noted, the celebrated ancient books on agriculture written by Mago of Carthage survives only via quotations in Latin from several later Roman works.\n\nSee also\nHistory of Carthage\nCarthage tophet\nAsterius Chapel\nMosaic of the Horses of Carthage\nNecropolis of the Rabs\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAltekamp, Stefan (2024).

          "summary": "Carthage (Arabic: قرطاج, ) was an ancient city in Northern Africa, on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis in what is now Tunisia. Carthage was one of the most important trading hubs of the Ancient Mediterranean and one of the most affluent cities of the classical world. It became the capital city of the civilization of Ancient Carthage and later Roman Carthage.\nThe city developed from a Phoenician colony into the capital of a Punic empire which dominated large parts of the Southwest Mediterranean during the first millennium BC. The legendary Queen Elissa, Alyssa or Dido, originally from Tyre, is regarded as the founder of the city, though her historicity has been questioned. In the myth, Dido asked for land from a local tribe, which told her that she could get as much land as an oxhide could cover. She cut the oxhide into strips and laid out the perimeter of the new city. As Carthage prospered at home, the polity sent colonists abroad as well as magistrates to rule the colonies.\nThe ancient city was destroyed in the nearly three year siege of Carthage by the Roman Republic during the Third Punic War in 146 BC. It was re-developed a century later as Roman Carthage, which became the major city of the Roman Empire in the province of Africa. The question of Carthaginian decline and demise has remained a subject of literary, political, artistic, and philosophical debates in both ancient and modern histories.\nLate antique and medieval Carthage continued to play an important cultural and economic role in the Byzantine period. The city was sacked and destroyed by Umayyad forces after the Battle of Carthage in 698 to prevent it from being reconquered by the Byzantine Empire. It remained occupied during the Muslim period and was used as a fort by the Muslims until the Hafsid period when it was taken by the Crusaders with its inhabitants massacred during the Eighth Crusade. The Hafsids decided to destroy its defenses so it could not be used as a base by a hostile power again. It also continued to function as an episcopal see.\nThe regional power shifted to Kairouan and the Medina of Tunis in the medieval period, until the early 20th century, when it began to develop into a coastal suburb of Tunis, incorporated as Carthage municipality in 1919. The archaeological site was first surveyed in 1830, by Danish consul Christian Tuxen Falbe. Excavations were performed in the second half of the 19th century by Charles Ernest Beulé and by Alfred Louis Delattre. The Carthage National Museum was founded in 1875 by Cardinal Charles Lavigerie. Excavations performed by French archaeologists in the 1920s first attracted attention because of the evidence they produced for child sacrifice. There has been considerable disagreement among scholars concerning whether child sacrifice was practiced by ancient Carthage. The open-air Carthage Paleo-Christian Museum has exhibits excavated under the auspices of UNESCO from 1975 to 1984. The site of the ruins is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",

التونسيه\n\nمقالات عن قرطاج\nقرطاج العاصمه في افريقيا الفينيقيه – رؤيه اثريه د. خليل المقداد 2008\nيذكر فيها: تاسيس المدينه: لقد كانت البدايه في تاسيس المدينه الفينيقيه قرطاج فوق انف المنقار الافريقي الشمالي المطل على منتصف الساحل الجنوبي لحوض البحر الابيض المتوسط حين رست سفينه الاميره الفينيقيه ايليسا ديدون على ضفاف الهضبه حاملهً الاميره الفينيقيه القادمه من عام 814 ق. م اي منذ 2825 عاماً مضت. وقد دخلت السفينه ورست على الشاطئ الافريقي في وضح النهار ودخل معها نور التاريخ والحضاره. ثم لحق بالاميره امير سوري فينيقي يدعى عينه بعد حريق مدينه طرواده، وهناك عشق الاميره الفينيقيه ايليسا Elissa من مدينه صور التي اسست مدينه قرطاج في القرن التاسع ق. م، ولظروفٍ غامضه اجبر على الهرب الى ايطاليا واسس هناك العديد من المدن ومنها مدينه لافينيوم Lavinium ومدينه روما.\nوحسب ما جاء في الملحمه الشعريه الاينيد Eneide للشاعر اللاتيني بوبيليوس فيرجيليوس ماروpublius virgilius maro (70-19 ق. م) صديق اوكتاف ان اينيه /عينه Enee الهارب احبَّ ديدون/ ايليسا وتزوجها، الا انه اجبر على هجرها بناءً على اوامر الاله زيوس/ جوبيتير ولهذا قتلته. ويذكر في المعتقدات الدينيه الرومانيه ايضاً ان روميليوس/ رومولوس Romulus مؤسس مدينه روما من احفاد عينه وزوجته الفينيقيه ايليسا من مدينه قرطاج.\n\nالثقافه\nتحتوي مدينه قرطاج على مكتبه عموميه ومركزا ثقافيا و20 رواقا فنيا وفيها الاكربوليوم وتضم متحفا واحدا متحف قرطاج و20 متنزها عموميا.\n\nمهرجان قرطاج الدولي\nهو مهرجان سنوي للموسيقى، ينتظم في الفتره المتده من منتصف شهر (يوليو، تموز) الى منتصف شهر اب من كل سنه منذ سنه 1964 بمدينه قرطاج الساحليه، الواقعه قرب مدينه تونس. يحتضن المسرح الاثري بقرطاج فعاليات هذا المهرجان كل سنه ويعتبر مهرجان قرطاج من ابرز المهرجانات العربيه والعالميه واعرقها.\nوكذلك يقام فيها مهرجان ايام قرطاج المسرحيه وفعاليات اخرى متعدده.\n\nمتحف قرطاج\nينتصب المتحف على قمه هضبه بيرسا تم انشاؤه عام 1875 م. وهو من حيث التنظيم المتحفي يحفظ ويعرض مجموعات من التحف الاثريه التي وجدت في هذا الموقع ويمثل ثلاث فترات كبـرى: الفتره الفينيقيـه البونيـه، الفتره الرومانيه الافريقيه والفتره العربيه الاسلاميه.\n\nالمعالم الاثريه الاخرى\nالحي البونيقي والفوروم: يقع هذا الحي بجوار متحف قرطاج الوطني وداخل نطاقه اذ يشكل جناحا تابعا لهذا المتحف يقع في الهواء الطلق. وقد تمت تهيئه هذا الحي في عهد حنبعل (في اوائل القرن الثاني ق م). وهو حي سكني تخترقه شوارع تتقاطع حسب زاويه قائمه، وتقوم داخله مجموعه من المباني ذات الطوابق نجدها مجزاه الى شقق سكنيه على غرار البناء الحديث. كما نجد به دكاكين مفتوحه على الشارع بالطابق الارضي من المباني.\nدمر حي بيرسا واحرق مع كامل المدينه في سنه 146 ق م، ولكنه ظل محميا من الاندثار تحت طبقه ضخمه من التراب والانقاض جنبته الزوال والتسويه بالارض خلال قرون عده.\n\nحمامات انطونيوس: شيدت الحمامات على شاطئ البحر في منتصف القرن الثاني بعد الميلاد (145 م- 162م) ثم دمرها الوندال فبقيت مده طويله مغموره تحت التراب. ولم يتم الكشف عنها وازاحه التربه من فوقها الا بعد سنه 1945.\nتاتي هذه الحمامات في المرتبه الثالثه في العالم من حيث الحجم بعد حمامات كاركالا بايطاليا وحمامات ديوكليسيان بسوريا. ولم يبق منها اليوم سوى الطابق تحت الارضي الذي كانت به غرف مقببه تمثل القاعات الفخمه للحمامات، وفي المحور الاوسط توجد القاعه البارده (Frigidaire) مقاييسها 47 × 22 مترا محموله على ثمانيه اعمده من الغرانيت كبيره الحجم من ضمنها واحده تم ترميمها لاعطاء فكره عن ارتفاعها (15 مترا مع التاج) كما توجد القاعه الساخنه على شكل قبه. ومن الجهتين تمتد، بالتناظر، الاجنحه المكونه من غرف منتصبه بانتظام حول الصحن المكشوف على الساحه.\n\nحي المنازل الرومانيه: يحتوي هذا الحي على مجموعه من المنازل الارستقراطيه موزعه بتناسق على سفح الهضبه الشرقيه للاديون او المسرح وعلى طول الكاردو و«دوكيمانوس» (نهجان بقرطاج حسب تقسيم الشوارع الرومانيه القديمه) وتخترق ممرات وفق رسم الشوارع الرومانيه القديمه. ومن بين المعالم التي لا تزال قائمه:\n- مبنى «السكولا» Schola وهو مقر جمعيه سياسيه دينيه، تقام فيه الطقوس الامبراطوريه\n- كنيسه مسيحيه تعود الى القرن السابع\n- كنيسه ذات طابع معماري بيزنطي خالص\n- مقبره بونيقيه\n- منزل روماني يعود تاريخه الى القرن الثالث تم ترميمه جزئيا في سنه 1960 واطلق عليه اسم \"villa de la voliére \" فيه رسوم فيفسائيه تغطي ارضيه البهو.\n\nالاديون: او المسرح ويتقدم هذا المعلم شمالا بهو في شكل مستطيل قد تهدم كليا ولم يبق منه سوى الاسس وبعض العناصر المعماريه وبعض الزينه التي عثر عليها خلال الحفريات 1900-1901.\nوقد اخرجت من الصهاريج الموجوده في الطابق تحت ارضي مجموعه كبيره من اجزاء مرمريه وتماثيل واجزاء معماريه كانت من ضمن زخرفه «الاديون».\nوكان هذا المعلم محل حفريات وبحث ودراسه من سنه 1994 الى سنه 1999.\n\nمسرح قرطاج الروماني: شيد المسرح الروماني في اوائل القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد على ضفاف هضبه «اوديون» Odeon» «ويتميز هذا المعلم بهندسته وزخرفته وبمدارجه نصف الدائريه التي يفوق قطرها 100 م تتخللها اعمده متوجه من الرخام المزركش.\nوزين مسرح قرطاج بتماثيل من بينها تمثال ابولون والذي تم ايداعه بمتحف باردو. لعب هذا المسرح دورا هاما جدا في حياه مواطني قرطاج الذين كانوا مولعين بالمسرح والموسيقى وفن المحاكاه والفلسفه مما ساهم في اشعاع الثقافه في تلك الحقبه.\nوقد رمم سنه 1967 ليكون فضاء مهرجان قرطاج الدولي.\n\nكنيسه داموس الكريطه: يضم هذا المركب الديني الشاسع كنيستان وبعض المباني الملحقه بهما. عثر عليه في افريقيه الرومانيه (65 م/ 45 م) فانها تبدو مقسمه الى اجنحه عديده باعمده لم يبق لها اثر زياده على جناحين كبيرين يتلاقيان وسط المعلم وينتهي كل منها بصدرفي الجنوب الشرقي والجنوب الغربي.\nصهاريج المعلقه: تتكون من 15 صهريجا طول الواحد 100 متر وعرضه 7 امتار وارتفاعه 7,50 متر، تحتل كلها اكثر من هكتار من المساحه وتبلغ كميه خزنها اكثر من 50.000 متر مكعب. وقد استعملت هذه الصهاريج في القرون الوسطى من طرف سكان القرى المجاوره.\nالمسرح الدائري بقرطاج: يوجد في مدخل المدينه من جهه الطريق السريعه تونس – قرطاج. كانت ساحه الانفتياتر شاهده على كل المعارك الداميه التي وقعت بين المصارعين والمحكومين عليهم بالاعدام والحيوانات المفترسه. وكانت الغايه من هذه المصارعه التي ينظمها الحاكم ابراز للرعيه مصير كل خارج عن سياسه حكمه. وقد بني منذ تاسيس المدينه بمساحه حوالي 120 مترا×93 متر، وحلبه تبلغ مساحتها 64 مترا× 36 متر. ووقع توسيعه في القرنين الثاني والثالث الى ان بلغ مساحته 156م ×128 م وبلغ حجم استيعابه اكثر من 41 الف نسمه.\nحي ماغون: اكتشف حي ماقون بعد حفريات عده اجريت على ضفاف البحر. ويمثل هذا الموقع تجمعا سكنيا يعود الى القرن الخامس ق م ويتميز بتواجد حي حسب تصميم متناسق محمي بسور مزود بكل شيء بمــا في ذلك مرسى بحري.\nوفي الفتره الاخيره وقع تحوير في الحي حيث وسعت المنازل واصبحت تضم فناء واعمده وطابقا علويا ويوجد بالحي خزانات وابار تزوده بالماء، كما تدل بقايا الحي المدهون والارضيه المزوقه على قيمه المعمار في تلك الحقبه من التاريخ.\nلقد دمر الحي في قرطاج البونيه لكن الرومان اسسوا عاصمه جديـده على الموقع ذاته وحافظوا على نفس النسق العمراني الذي امتد على كامـــل ارض المدينه.\n\nمدفن \" التوفاه \": كان القرطاجيون يعتقدون في وجود عالم فوقي مليء بالكائنات المقدسه المنظمه، فقاموا ببعض الطقوس التي تضمن للمؤمن الرخاء والسعاده في الارض وايضا الخلاص الابدي للروح ولقد كانوا يعبدون الهه كثيره من اصل فينيقي،

          "title": "Medina of Tunis",
          "content": "The Medina of Tunis is the medina quarter of Tunis, the capital of Tunisia. It has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979.\nThe Medina contains some 700 monuments, including palaces, mosques, mausoleums, madrasas and fountains dating from various periods.\n\nHistory\nFounded in 698 around the original core of the Zitouna Mosque, the Medina of Tunis developed throughout the Middle Ages. The main axis was between the mosque and the centre of government to the west in the kasbah. To the east this same main road extended to the Bab el Bhar. Expansions to the north and south divided the main Medina into two suburbs north (Bab Souika) and south (Bab El Jazira).\nBefore the Almohad Caliphate, other cities such as Mahdia and Kairouan had served as capitals.  Under Almohad rule, Tunis became the capital of Ifriqiya, and under the Hafsid period it developed into a religious, intellectual and economic center.  It was during the Hafsid period that the Medina as we now know it took on its essential form. It gradually acquired a number of buildings and monuments combining the styles of Ifriqiya, Andalusian and Oriental influences, but also borrowing some of the columns and capitals of Roman and Byzantine monuments.\n\nSocial and urban structure\nWith an area of 270 hectares (670 acres) (plus 29 hectares (72 acres) for the district of the kasbah) and nearly 110,000 inhabitants, the Medina has one-tenth of the population of Tunis and a sixth of the urbanized area of the agglomeration.\nThe complex organization of the urban fabric fueled an entire colonial literature of the dangerous Medina, anarchic and chaotic, and the territory of ambush. However, since the 1930s, with the arrival of the first ethnologists, studies have revealed that the articulation of the Medina areas is not random, and houses are built according to clear sociocultural norms, codified according to complex types of human relationships. Many publications have detailed the development of the Medina model and system of prioritization of public and private spaces, residential and commercial, sacred and profane.\nThe urban layout of the Medina of Tunis has the distinction of not obeying geometrical layouts or formal compositions such as gridlines. Nevertheless the north-south and east-west axes are comparable to a Roman cardo and decumanus (Sidi Ben Arous, Jemaa Zitouna and Pasha Streets) that intersect at the court of Zitouna mosque, house of prayer and studies. The thoroughfares include the main streets; secondary streets and finally, small cul-de-sacs.  Sometimes entire private spots are reserved for women. The built environment is generally characterized by the juxtaposition of large plots (600 m2) and joint ownership.\nThe concept of public space is ambiguous in the Medina where the streets are considered as the extension of houses and subject to social tags.  The notion of individual ownership is low and displays in the souks often spill out onto the highway. This idea is reinforced by the area of a shop (about 3 m2) and bedroom (10 m2).\n\nIn the case of domestic architecture, the more a building is set back from the shops, the more it is valued. The concept of withdrawal and privacy is paramount. The late introduction of a sewer system means that much waste water still flows through the streets of the Medina. The largest houses and noble places are generally located in the district with the highest elevation, the Kasbah quarter. The roof terraces of the Medina are also an important place for social life, as illustrated by the film Halfaouine by Férid Boughedir.\nNowadays, every district retains its culture and rivalries can be strong. Thus, the northern suburb supports the football club Espérance Sportive de Tunis while the southern side is the district of the rival Club Africain. The Medina has also witnessed a social segmentation: the districts of Tourbet el Bey and the kasbah are wealthier, with a population of judges and politicians, Pasha street is the military and the bourgeoisie (merchants and notables), and smaller communities such as Hafisa where the Jewish population have traditionally lived.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Muradid dynasty were great builders in the Medina. Hammouda Pasha (1631–1666) was responsible for the construction of many souks in the Medina, as well as many palaces, including the Dar Hammouda Pacha and the predecessor of the modern Dar El Bey. In 1655, he had Ottoman architects build the Hammouda Pacha Mosque in the Turkish style, with an elegant octagonal minaret, below which he constructed his family mausoleum.  His son Murad II Bey (1666–1675) built the Mouradia Madrasah, dedicated to the Maliki school of Islamic law. Murad's son Mohamed Bey El Mouradi (1686–1696) built several monuments in Tunis including the (Sidi Mahrez Mosque), modelled on the mosques of Istanbul with a great central dome.\nThe Husainid ruler Ali II ibn Hussein (1759–1782) had the Tourbet el Bey constructed in the south of the Medina as a mausoleum for his family, It is the largest funerary monument in Tunis.\nIn the time of Muhammad III as-Sadiq (1859–1882) the walls of the Medina were in such bad repair that in some places they threatened to collapse. In 1865 he began demolishing them, along with a number of the Medina's historic gates: Bab Cartagena, Bab Souika, Bab Bnet and Bab El Jazira.\n\nDomestic architecture\nDar Lasram\nDar Al Jaziri\nDar Bach Hamba\nDar Ben Ayed\n\nLandmarks\nCity gates\nOut of the original four gates, two are still standing, namely the Bab el Bhar in the east and the Bab Sidi Kacem as part of the Kasbah Fortress in the south-west. The other two, located at the northern entrances, were named Bab Sidi Abdallah Cherif and Bab El Allouj.\n\nMadrasas\nSince the Hafsid era, madrasas had emerged in the medina of Tunis which appeared in Arab Orient style. It was established to serve Almohads by raising workers for public services. The Hafsid sultans took care of the establishment of madrasas, and the princesses participated in this effort as well as the initiatives of the scholars and the imams in this field, and several madrasas emerged as a link to the patrons. The establishment of schools continued after the annexation of Tunisia by the Ottoman Empire, but the purpose of these madrasas had changed over time. Since 17th century when the Ottomans arrived, they employed these madrasas to spread their Hanafi maddhab. However in the 20th century, the role of these madrasas are mostly confined to accommodation of the students studying in Ez-Zitouna University.\n\nMosques\nThe Medina contains most of the great mosques of the capital, which were all built before the French protectorate.\nThe main Zitouna Mosque was built in 732 in the heart of the Medina and then rebuilt in 864. It was also for a long time an important place of culture and knowledge, acting as home to the Zitouna University until the independence of Tunisia. It still hosts ceremonies marking the main dates of the Muslim calendar that are regularly attended by the President of the Republic.\nThe Kasbah Mosque built between 1231 and 1235, was the second mosque to be built in the Medina, intended for the rulers themselves, who lived in the nearby Kasbah. It is distinguished especially by the dome in stalactites preceding the mihrab and by its minaret that recalls that of the Koutoubia of Marrakech and is the highest in the Medina.\nThe Ksar Mosque of the Hanafi rite, located opposite the Dar Hussein (Bab Menara), was built in the 12th century under the Khurasanid dynasty.\nThe Youssef Dey Mosque functioned first as an oratory before becoming a mosque in 1631, and is the first mosque of the Ottoman-Turkish period. The Hammouda-Pacha mosque, built in 1655, was the second mosque of the Hanefite rite built in Tunis while the Sidi Mahrez mosque is the largest mosque of this type in the country. Built from 1692 to 1697, it is Ottoman-inspired and recalls some Istanbul mosques such as the Blue Mosque (erected between 1609 and 1616) and the Yeni Valide (completed in 1663). The El Jedid Mosque, built by the founder of the Hussein dynasty Hussein the Ist Bey between 1723 and 1727, has, like the Youssef Dey and Hammouda-Pacha mosques, an Ottoman-inspired octagonal minaret.\nThe Saheb Ettabaâ Mosque, built between 1808 and 1814, is the last mosque constructed in Tunis by the Husseinites before the French occupation.\n\nPalaces\nThe palaces or the Dars are one of the most important historical monuments in the ancient city of Tunis, which were inhabited by politicians, wealthy class and dignitaries of the city.\n\nClimate change\nAs a coastal heritage site, Medina of Tunis is vulnerable to sea level rise. In 2022, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report included it in the list of African cultural sites which would be threatened by flooding and coastal erosion by the end of the century, but only if climate change followed RCP 8.5, which is the scenario of high and continually increasing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the warming of over 4 °C., and is no longer considered very likely. The other, more plausible scenarios result in lower warming levels and consequently lower sea level rise: yet, sea levels would continue to increase for about 10,000 years under all of them. Even if the warming is limited to 1.5 °C, global sea level rise is still expected to exceed 2–3 m (7–10 ft) after 2000 years (and higher warming levels will see larger increases by then), consequently exceeding 2100 levels of sea level rise under RCP 8.5 (~0.75 m (2 ft) with a range of 0.5–1 m (2–3 ft)) well before the year 4000. This means that unless effective adaptation efforts such as sea walls can be constructed to deal with the sea level rise, damage and the potential destruction of Medina of Tunis is a matter of time.\n\nSee also\nReligion in Tunisia\nSainte-Croix Church of Tunis, a former church building\nSidi Abdallah Cherif Mausoleum\nMoorish architecture\nHara, the former Jewish quarter of the Medina of Tunis\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAssociation pour la sauvegarde de la medina de Tunis (in French)\nUNESCO site on the Tunis Medina\nthe Hafsia quarter of the medina of Tunis\nthe former Jewish quarter (hara) of the medina",

          "content": "Al-Zaytuna Mosque, also known as Ez-Zitouna Mosque, and El-Zituna Mosque (Arabic: جامع الزيتونة, romanized: Jāmiʿ al-Zaytūnah, lit. 'Mosque of the olive'), is a major mosque at the center of the Medina of Tunis in Tunis, Tunisia. The mosque is the oldest in the city and covers an area of 5,000 square metres (1.2 acres) with nine entrances. It was founded at the end of the 7th century or in the early 8th century, but its current architectural form dates from a reconstruction in the 9th century, including many antique columns reused from Carthage, and from later additions and restorations over the centuries. \nThe mosque developed into a place of higher education, today the University of Ez-Zitouna, which became the most important educational institution in Tunisia from around the 13th century onward. Ibn 'Arafa, a major Maliki scholar, al-Maziri, the great traditionalist and jurist, and Aboul-Qacem Echebbi, a famous Tunisian poet, all taught there, among others.\n\nEtymology\nOne legend states that it was called \"Mosque of Olive\" because it was built on an ancient place of worship where there was an olive. Another account, transmitted by the 17th century Tunisian historian Ibn Abi Dinar, reports the presence of a Byzantine Christian church dedicated to Santa Olivia at that location. Archeological investigations and restoration works in 1969–1970 have shown that the mosque was built over an existing Byzantine-era building with columns, covering a cemetery. This may have been a Christian basilica, which provides support for the legend reported by Ibn Abi Dinar. A more recent interpretation by Muhammad al-Badji Ibn Mami suggests that the previous structures may have been part of a Byzantine fortification, inside which the Arab conquerors built their mosque. This hypothesis is also supported by Sihem Lamine.\nThe saint is particularly venerated in Tunisia because it is superstitiously thought that if the site and its memory are profaned then a misfortune will happen; this includes a belief that when her relics are recovered Islam will end. This ancillary legend related to the discovery of the saint's relics is widespread in Sicily, however it is connected to other Saints as well. In 1402 king Martin I of Sicily requested the return of Saint Olivia's relics from the Berber Caliph of Ifriqiya Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz II, who refused him. Even today the Tunisians, who still venerate her, believe that the dominion of their religion will fade when the body of the Virgin Olivia will disappear.\n\nHistory\nFoundation\nAl-Zaytuna was the second mosque to be built in Ifriqiya and the Maghreb region after the Mosque of Uqba in Kairouan. The exact date of building varies according to different sources and interpretations. The 11th-century writer Al-Bakri wrote that Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab, the Umayyad governor of Ifriqiya, built a Friday mosque (jāmīʿ) in Tunis in 114 AH (732/733 CE). Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406) also repeats this account. However, al-Bakri also mentions a mosque (masjid) being built by Hasan ibn al-Nu'man, who led the conquest of Carthage, in 79 AH (698/699 CE). \nModern historians have been divided over the exact date of construction and on whether it should be attributed to Ibn al-Habhab or to Ibn al-Nu'man. Most scholars support the second explanation and attribute the foundation to Ibn al-Nu'man in 698 CE. Under this explanation, it is assumed that Ibn al-Habhab subsequently rebuilt it, expanded it, or completed its construction. One supporting argument is that it is unlikely the city of Tunis remained a long time without a mosque after its conquest in 79 AH (698/699CE). Ahmed ibn Abu Diyaf, a 19th-century Tunisian historian, attributes the foundation to Hasan ibn al-Nu'man in 84 AH (703/704CE). Lucien Golvin, a 20th-century French scholar, argued that Ibn al-Habhab was the founder but that the construction took place in 116 AH (734/735CE).\n\nAghlabid reconstruction\nThe mosque owes its current overall form to a reconstruction under the Aghlabids, the dynasty that ruled Ifriqiya on behalf of the Abbasid caliphs in the 9th century. The work was begun during the reign of emir Abu Ibrahim Ahmad and completed in 864–865. As a result, the mosque's layout is also very similar to the Mosque of Uqba in Kairouan, which was also rebuilt by the Aghlabids earlier in the same century. A contemporary inscription at the base of the dome in front of the mihrab gives the date of this construction and names three individuals: 1) the Abbasid caliph al-Musta'in Billah, identified as the main patron; 2) Nusayr, a mawla of the caliph and probably the overseer of the works; and 3) Fathallah or Fath al-Banna', the architect and chief builder. Another inscription, along one of the mosque's courtyard façades, provides the same information. The Aghlabid emir himself (Abu Ibrahim Ahmad) is not mentioned in these inscriptions, suggesting that he may not have been officially involved in the construction and that Nusayr was directing the works directly on behalf of the Abbasid caliph instead. \nThe Aghlabid structure, in turn, is mostly obscured today by later additions and reconstructions. The sections that are best preserved from the 9th century are the interior of the prayer hall (though some of this was later rebuilt too) and the projecting round corner bastions at the northern and eastern corners of the mosque. There is no evidence that a minaret was attached to the mosque at this time. The reasons for this omission are unclear. It suggests that minarets were not yet a standard feature of congregational mosques or that they were still considered a controversial innovation at the time.\n\nLater history\nBetween 990 and 995 further works were carried out under the Zirids, clients of the Fatimid caliphs. These works included the addition of galleries around the courtyard and the Qubbat al-Bahu (or Qubbat al-Bahw), the dome at the entrance of the prayer hall. The dome itself is dated more specifically to 991. The dates for these works are provided by a series of inscriptions around the Qubbat al-Bahu, but the names of the patrons themselves were erased at a later period, possibly when the Zirids declared independence from the Fatimids in the 11th century. From context, the works can be attributed to the patronage of the Zirid emir Al-Mansur ibn Buluggin. The inscriptions also provide the names of four craftsmen: Ahmad al-Burjini, Abu al-Thana, 'Abdallah ibn Qaffas, and Bishr ibn al-Burjini.\n\nUnder the Hafsids, who ruled during the 13th to 15th centuries, Tunis became the main capital of Ifriqiya for the first time. This led to an increase in the Zaytuna Mosque's importance and allowed it to overtake the prestige of the older Mosque of Uqba in Kairouan. Significant restoration work was carried out by the Hafsid rulers, under al-Mustansir in 1250 and under Abu Yahya Zakariya in the early 14th century, adding features such as ablution facilities and replacing some of the woodwork. Other repairs and restorations were carried at multiple points during this era. The mosque's first attested minaret was also built under Hafsid patronage in 1438–1439. Its appearance is known from old photographs: it had a cuboid shape (having a shaft with a square base) and was crowned with an arcaded gallery and a polygonal turret or lantern at its summit. \n\nIn 1534 Spanish forces occupied Tunis and broke into the mosque, raiding its libraries and destroying or dispersing many of its manuscripts. During the Ottoman period, both the Muradid and Husaynid dynasties restored and expanded the mosque and its associated institutions. This helped restore the mosque's prominence and its prestige as a center of learning. In 1637 an arcaded loggia was added to the mosque's exterior eastern façade by a patron named Muhammad al-Andalus ibn Ghalib, whose name suggests he was one of the moriscos expelled from Spain in 1609. From 1624 to 1812 the local Bakri family took charge of the mosque's care and occupied the position of the mosque's imam. The present-day minaret was entirely rebuilt in 1894 and imitates the Almohad style of the Kasbah Mosque's minaret further west. Tunisian presidents Bourguiba and Ben Ali carried out major restoration work and rehabilitation, especially during the 1960s and 1990s.\n\nScholarship and the University\nThere is little information about teaching at the Zaytuna Mosque prior to the 14th century. During this time there were most likely courses being offered voluntarily by ulama (Islamic legal scholars), but not in an organized manner. For centuries, Kairouan was the early centre of learning and intellectual pursuits in Tunisia and North Africa in general. Starting from the 13th century, Tunis became the capital of Ifriqiya under Almohad and Hafsid rule. This shift in power helped al-Zaytuna to flourish and become one of the major centres of Islamic learning, and Ibn Khaldun, the first social historian in history was one of its products. The flourishing university attracted students and men of learning from all parts of the known world at the time. Along with disciplines theology – such as exegesis of the Qur'an (tafsir) – the university taught fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), Arabic grammar, history, science and medicine. It also had a kuttab or elementary school that taught youth how to read, write, and memorize religious texts. The system of teaching was not rigid: attendance was not mandatory and students could follow the courses of their choice. Students who followed a course and became knowledgeable enough to teach the subject on their own were granted a certificate called an ijazah by their instructor.\nRich libraries were also attached to the university. The manuscripts covered almost all subjects and sciences, including grammar, logic, documentations, etiquette of research, cosmology, arithmetic, geometry, minerals, vocational training, etc. One of its famous libraries, al-Abdaliyah, included a large collection of rare manuscripts that attracted scholars from abroad. Much of the library's original collection was dispersed or destroyed when the Spanish occupied Tunis and broke into the Zaytuna Mosque in 1534. After Tunisia gained independence from France in the 1950s the university's library was integrated into the National Libraries of Tunis.\nThe start of Ottoman rule in 1574 initially brought a decline in teaching, but this quickly recovered. The institution received greater attention and political patronage in the 18th century. By this time, however, the teaching of non-religious subjects had significantly declined. Administrative and curricular reforms to the institution were begun by Ahmad Bey in 1842. They continued in 1875 under Prime Minister Khayr al-Din al-Tunisi, who also expanded the al-Abdaliyah Library and opened it to the public. In 1896 new courses were introduced such as physics, political economy, and French, and in 1912 these reforms were extended to the university's other branches in Kairouan, Sousse, Tozeur, and Gafsa. Until the 20th century the students were mostly recruited from Tunisia's wealthiest families but afterwards its recruitment broadened. Under French colonial rule it turned into a bastion of Arab and Islamic culture resisting French influence. Some prominent members of the Algerian nationalist movement studied here, such as 'Abd al-Hamid ibn Badis, Tawfiq Madani, and Houari Boumédiène. \nAfter independence from France, reforms to the education system in 1958 and the creation of the University of Tunis in 1960 reduced the Zaytuna's importance. In 1964–1965 its status as an independent university was abolished by President Habib Bourguiba and it was relegated to being a theological college for the University of Tunis. For years afterward, under the rule of both Bourguiba and his successor Ben Ali, the Zaytuna educational institution was kept officially and physically distinct from the Zaytuna Mosque itself. In 2012, after the Tunisian revolution and in response to a court petition by a group of Tunisian citizens, the mosque's former educational offices were reopened and it was declared an independent educational institution once again.\n\nArchitecture\nGeneral layout\nThe al-Zaytuna Mosque followed the design and architecture of previous mosques, particularly the Mosque of Uqba in Kairouan that was built in its current form a few decades earlier. The layout of the building and its interior is irregular, with many of its lines not quite parallel or perpendicular, but this is not perceptible to a visitor. The building consists primarily of a trapezoidal courtyard (sahn) and a hypostyle prayer hall. The main difference between this mosque and the Kairouan mosque is the position of the minaret, which in this case was added at a much later period. \nThe mosque is closely integrated into the urban fabric and most of the building's exterior is concealed by other neighbouring structures. Only on the eastern side of the mosque is an external façade, fronted by an arcaded loggia from 1637. The adjoining rooms and structures around the rest of the mosque's perimeter include shops, libraries, and maqsuras (areas reserved for specific individuals or groups during prayer).\n\nCourtyard and minaret\nThe courtyard is accessible from the exterior via seven doorways and is surrounded by galleries supported by arcades of arches and columns. The gallery on the southern side, preceding the prayer hall, dates from the 10th-century Zirid restoration and is supported by spoliated antique columns and capitals, while the three other galleries currently date from the 17th and 19th centuries, with columns imported from Italy by the prime minister Mustapha Khaznadar in the mid-19th century. The pavement of the courtyard itself consists of antique marble plaques, also spolia. \n\nThe square minaret rises from the northwest corner of the courtyard. Built in 1894, the minaret is 43 meters (141 ft) high and imitates the decoration of the Almohad-style minaret of the Kasbah Mosque with its limestone strap-work in a sebka pattern on a background of ochre sandstone.\n\nPrayer hall\nThe central entrance to the prayer hall is covered by a dome, the Qubbat al-Bahu, added by the Zirids around 991. Measuring about 12 metres in height and 4 metres in width, the dome has a sophisticated construction and Jonathan Bloom describes it is one of the finest architectural works from this period of western Islamic architecture. The dome is ribbed and rests on an octagonal base, which rests in turn on a square supporting structure. The ornamentation includes carved moldings, decorative blind arches and niches, pilasters, and polychrome mosaic or ablaq stonework in red, white, and black stone. The arches and windows have horseshoe arches and voussoirs of alternating white and red stone. Arabic inscriptions in Fatimid floriated Kufic are found around the base of the dome and above the capitals of some of the columns.\nThe hypostyle prayer hall is divided into 15 aisles by rows of columns, 6 bays long, supporting horseshoe arches running perpendicular to the southeastern qibla wall. Each aisle is about 3 metres wide but the central aisle, leading to the mihrab (niche symbolizing the qibla), is wider than the others at 4.8 metres. Another transverse aisle runs in front of the qibla wall. There are around 160 columns and most of them are antique spolia, most likely taken from the site of Carthage. The space in front of the mihrab is covered by a well-preserved dome from the Aghlabid period (9th century), with Kufic inscriptions from the same period. A few carved stucco panels along the upper walls of the central aisle, probably former windows, still date from the Aghlabid period. \nThe mihrab itself was redecorated in later periods and most of the prayer hall's decoration, apart from the antique columns, dates from the 13th century onward. The stucco decoration around the mihrab dates largely from 1638, and the stuccowork on the imposts of the columns dates from 1820. Inside the mihrab is a marble plaque covered in gold leaf and carved with an Aghlabid Kufic inscription with religious formulas such as the shahada. \nThe minbar (pulpit) next to the mihrab is one of the oldest existing minbars after the minbar of Kairouan, though only some of its side panels are still originals from the Aghlabid period, with the others dating from later renovations. The latest pieces date from 1583 in the early Ottoman period. The minbar is smaller than the Kairouan minbar, measuring 2.53 by 3.30 metres. The wooden panels are carved with a variety of geometric and stylized vegetal motifs.\n\nSee also\nIslam in Tunisia\nList of mosques in Tunisia\nList of the oldest mosques in the world\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Zaytuna Mosque at Wikimedia Commons",

          "content": "Kairouan (UK: , US: ), also spelled El Qayrawān or Kairwan (Arabic: ٱلْقَيْرَوَان, romanized: al-Qayrawān [æl qɑjrɑˈwæːn] , Tunisian Arabic: Qeirwān [qɪrˈwɛːn] ), is the capital of the Kairouan Governorate in Tunisia and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city was founded by the Umayyads around 670, in the period of Caliph Mu'awiya (reigned 661–680); this is when it became an important centre for Sunni Islamic scholarship and Quranic learning, attracting Muslims from various parts of the world. The Mosque of Uqba is situated in the city.\n\nEtymology\nThe name (ٱلْقَيْرَوَان al-Qayrawān) is an Arabic word meaning \"military group\" or \"caravan\", borrowed early on from the Middle Persian word kārawān (modern Persian کاروان kârvân), meaning \"military column\" (kâr \"people/military\" + vân \"outpost\") or \"caravan\" (see caravanserai). In Berber, the city used to be called تيكيروان Tikirwan, thought to be an adaptation of the Arabic name. It has also been romanized as Cairoan in early modern English.\n\nHistory\nFoundation and early Islamic period\nThe foundation of Kairouan dates to about the year 670 when the Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi of Caliph Mu'awiya selected a site in the middle of a dense forest, then infested with wild beasts and reptiles, as the location of a military post for the conquest of the West. Formerly, the city of Kamounia was located where Kairouan now stands. It had housed a Byzantine garrison before the Arab conquest, and stood far from the sea – safe from the continued attacks of the Berbers who had fiercely resisted the Arab invasion. Berber resistance continued, led first by Kusaila, whose troops killed Uqba at Biskra about fifteen years after the establishment of the military post, and then by a Berber woman called Al-Kahina who was killed and her army defeated in 702. Subsequently, there occurred a mass conversion of the Berbers to Islam. Kharijites or Islamic \"outsiders\" who formed an egalitarian and puritanical sect appeared and are still present on the island of Djerba.\nIn October 741, in the course of the Great Berber Revolt in the Maghreb, the Ifriqiyan army, along with a Syrian force dispatched by the caliph, was destroyed by the Berbers at the Battle of Bagdoura. The governor Kulthum ibn Iyad al-Qasi perished in the field, his nephew and successor Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri was holed up with the remnant of the army in Spain, leaving the whole of Ifriqiya open to the advance of the Berber rebels. Not having any more forces at his disposal, the Umayyad Caliph Hisham quickly appointed Handhala ibn Safwan as governor of Ifriqiya, with supervisory authority over all the Maghreb (North Africa west of Egypt) and al-Andalus (Spain), and instructed him to take whatever forces he could gather to defend Ifriqiya and quash the Berber rebellion. Leaving Egypt in the hand of Hafs ibn al-Walid ibn Yusuf al-Hadrami, Handhala set out westwards in February 742, picking up additional forces from Barqa (Cyrenaica) and Tripoli (Tripolitana). He arrived in Kairouan around April, 742. The qadi of Ifriqiya, Abd al-Rahman ibn Oqba al-Ghaffari, had been managing the defense of Kairouan, and succeeded in fending off an attack by the Berber rebel army raised in southern Tunisia by the Sufrite leader Oqasha ibn Ayub al-Fezari. Handhala ibn Safwan arrived in Kairouan just as Oqasha was said to be mounting a new attack, in coordination with another large Berber army coming in from the west, led by Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid al-Hawwari. The Berber rebel armies were to make junction in front of Kairouan, before launching their final attack on the city. Wasting no time, Handhala dispatched a cavalry force to slow down Abd al-Wahid's progress, and threw the bulk of his forces south, defeating Oqasha in a bloody battle at El-Qarn and taking him prisoner. But Handhala had taken a lot of losses himself, and now faced the unhappy prospect of Abd al-Wahid's gigantic army, said to be some 300,000, ostensibly the largest Berber army ever seen. Hurrying back, Handhala is said to have put the entire population of Kairouan under arms to bolster his ranks, before setting out again. In perhaps the bloodiest encounter in the Berber wars, Handhala ibn Safwan defeated the great Berber army of Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid at al-Asnam in May 742 (perhaps a little later), just three miles outside of Kairouan. Some 120,000–180,000 Berbers, including Abd al-Wahid, fell in the field of battle in that single encounter.\n\nAghlabid period\nIn 745, Kharijite Berbers captured Kairouan, which was already at that time a developed city with luxuriant gardens and olive groves. Power struggles continued until Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab recaptured Kairouan at the end of the 8th century.\n\nIn 800 Caliph Harun ar-Rashid in Baghdad confirmed Ibrahim as emir and hereditary ruler of Ifriqiya. Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab founded the Aghlabid dynasty which ruled Ifriqiya between 800 and 909. The new emirs embellished Kairouan and made it their capital. It soon became famous for its wealth and prosperity, reaching the levels of Basra and Kufa and giving Tunisia a period of power and prosperity.\nThe Aghlabids built the great mosque and established in it a university that was a centre of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences. Its role can be compared to that of the University of Paris in the Middle Ages. In the 9th century, the city became a brilliant focus of Arab and Islamic cultures attracting scholars from all over the Islamic World. In that period Imam Sahnun and Asad ibn al-Furat made of Kairouan a temple of knowledge and a magnificent centre of diffusion of Islamic sciences. The Aghlabids also built palaces, fortifications and fine waterworks of which only the pools remain. From Kairouan envoys from Charlemagne and the Holy Roman Empire returned with glowing reports of the Aghlabid palaces, libraries and gardens – and from the crippling taxation imposed to pay for their drunkenness and sundry debaucheries. The Aghlabids also pacified the country and conquered Sicily in 827.\n\nFatimid and Zirid period\nIn 893, through the mission of Abdullah al Mahdi, the Kutama Berbers from the west of the country started the movement of the Shiite Fatimids. The year 909 saw the overthrow of the Sunni Aghlabids who ruled Ifriqiya and the establishment of the Fatimid dynasty. During the rule of the Fatimids, Kairouan was neglected and lost its importance: the new rulers resided first in Raqqada but soon moved their capital to the newly built Al Mahdiyah on the eastern coast of Tunisia. After succeeding in extending their rule over all of central Maghreb, an area consisting of the modern countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, they eventually moved east to Egypt to found Cairo making it the capital of their vast Caliphate and leaving the Zirids as their vassals in Ifriqiya. Governing again from Kairouan, the Zirids led the country through another artistic, commercial and agricultural heyday. Schools and universities flourished, overseas trade in local manufactures and farm produce ran high and the courts of the Zirids rulers were centres of refinement that eclipsed those of their European contemporaries. When the Zirids declared their independence from Cairo and their conversion to Sunni Islam in 1045 by giving allegiance to Baghdad, the Fatimid Caliph Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah sent as punishment hordes of troublesome Arab tribes (Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym) to invade Ifriqiya. These invaders so utterly captured Kairouan from the Zirids in 1057 and destroyed it that it never regained its former importance and their influx was a major factor in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant. Some 1,700 years of intermittent but continual progress was undone within a decade as in most part of the country the land was laid to waste for nearly two centuries.\n\nLater history\nAl-Idrisi described the city in the 12th century:The city of Kairouan is the mother of settlements and the capital of regions. It was once the greatest city of the West in its expanse, the most populous, the wealthiest, the most prosperous, the most finely built, and the most ambitious, with the most profitable trade, the highest tax revenues, the most flourishing markets, and the greatest commercial gains, while its people were also the most rebellious and the most arrogant of the ignorant, yet among its virtuous elite, the dominant qualities were adherence to righteousness, fulfillment of covenants, avoidance of doubtful matters, abstention from prohibitions, mastery of refined sciences, and an inclination toward moderation. But God Almighty afflicted it with the Arabs, and calamities befell it one after another, until nothing remained of it but fading ruins and obliterated traces. In our present time, only a portion of it is enclosed by an earthen wall. Its rulers are Arabs, who collect whatever revenues remain. A few people still reside there, engaged in modest trade with meager benefits. Scholars speculate that it will soon return to its former state of prosperity and grandeur. Its water supply is scarce, and its inhabitants drink from the great cistern (majel) within the city. This cistern is an architectural marvel, as it is built in a square shape with a tower-like structure rising in the center. Each side measures two hundred cubits, and it remains filled with water. Kairouan was originally two cities: one was Kairouan itself, and the other was Sabra. Sabra was the royal residence, and at the height of its prosperity, it contained three hundred baths—most of them private, while the rest were public for all people. Sabra, however, is now in complete ruin, devoid of any inhabitants.\nIn the 13th century under the prosperous Hafsids dynasty that ruled Ifriqiya, the city started to emerge from its ruins. It is only under the Husainid Dynasty that Kairouan started to find an honorable place in the country and throughout the Islamic world.\nIn 1881, Kairouan was taken by the French, after which non-Muslims were allowed access to the city. The French built the 600 mm (1 ft 11+5⁄8 in) Sousse–Kairouan Decauville railway, which operated from 1882 to 1996, before it was regauged to 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) gauge.\nThe old city of Kairouan and its associated historic monuments became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988.\nIn December 2023, about 30m of wall near the Gate of the Leather Workers collapsed during restoration. Three masons were killed, and several others injured.\n\nGeography\nLocation\nKairouan, the capital of Kairouan Governorate, lies south of Sousse, 50 km (31 mi) from the east coast, 75 km (47 mi) from Monastir and 184 km (114 mi) from Tunis.\n\nClimate\nKairouan has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh).\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, the city had about 187,000 inhabitants.\n\nReligion\nBetween the 9th and 11th centuries AD, Kairouan functioned as one of the great centers of Islamic civilization and gained a reputation as a hotbed of scholarship across the entire Maghreb. During this period, the Great Mosque of Kairouan became both a place of prayer and a center for teaching Islamic sciences under the Maliki current. A unique religious tradition practiced in Kairouan was the use of Islamic law to enforce monogamy by stipulating it in the marriage contract. Local tradition holds that seven pilgrimages to the Great Mosque equals one pilgrimage to Mecca. According to some, this makes Kairouan the fourth holiest city in Islam after Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. As of 2004, the city contained 89 mosques. Sufi festivals are held in the city in memory of saints.\nBefore the arrival of the French in 1881, non-Muslims were forbidden from living in Kairouan. A Christian community had existed during the early 11th century alongside Jews who were among the original settlers of Kairouan. The Jewish community's golden era began in the late 8th century and lasted until the early 11th century during which time it played an important role in Jewish history, having been a world center of Talmudic and Halakhic scholarship for at least three generations. The Banu Hilal conquest of Kairouan in 1057 led to the decline of the medieval community with Jews only returning after Tunisia was established as a French protectorate in 1881. By the 1960s the community had disappeared, and all that remains is their dilapidated cemetery.\n\nMain sights\nGreat Mosque of Kairouan\nThe city's main landmark is the Great Mosque of Sidi-Uqba (also known as the Great Mosque of Kairouan) which is one of the most impressive and largest Islamic monuments in North Africa. Originally built when Kairouan was founded in 670 AD, the mosque currently occupies an area of over 9,000 square metres (97,000 sq ft) and is one of the oldest places of worship in the Islamic world. The mosque became a center of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences and helped the city to develop and expand.\n\nMosque of the Three Doors\nThe Mosque of the Three Doors was founded in 866. Its façade is a notable example of Islamic architecture. It has three arched doorways surmounted by three inscriptions in Kufic script, interspersed with floral and geometrical reliefs and topped by a carved frieze; the first inscription includes the verses 70–71 in the sura 33 of Quran. The small minaret was added during the restoration works held under the Hafsid dynasty. The prayer hall has a nave and two aisles, divided by arched columns, parallel to the qibla wall.\n\nMosque of the Barber\nThe Zawiya of Sidi Sahib, also known as the Mosque of the Barber, is a religious complex containing the mausoleum of Abu Zama' al-Balawi, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who, according to legend, had saved for himself three hairs of Muhammad's beard, hence the edifice's name. The complex was first built up in the 14th century under the Hafsids, but in its present state it dates from the 17th century, under the Muradids. The tomb chamber is accessed from a cloister-like court with rich tile and stucco decoration. In addition to the mausoleum, the complex includes a madrasa and several other facilities.\n\nAghlabid basins\nThe Aghlabid basins are a Tunisian historical monument located in Kairouan. Dating from the 9th century and located outside the ramparts of the medina of Kairouan, they are considered to be the most important hydraulic systems in the history of the Muslim world. The structure covers an area of 11,000 square meters and consists of a small settling basin, a large basin for storing water and two drawing tanks, all having a total storage capacity of 68,800 cubic meters.\n\nEconomy\nThe primary economic sectors in Kairouan are industry, agriculture and tourism.\n\nIndustry\nThe Kairouan region currently has 167 industrial companies offering more than 10,000 jobs, of which 33 are fully exporters.\nThe industrial activities of the region are quite diversified, although the agrifood industry sector is preeminent with 91 units.\n\nAgriculture\nThe governorate of Kairouan is known mainly for the production of vegetables (peppers, tomatoes) and fruits (apricots, almonds and olives). It is the leading national producer of chili peppers with nearly 90,000 tonnes in 2019, as well as apricots with more than 15,000 tonnes.\n\nTourism\nKairouan is one of the four most visited sites in Tunisia along with Carthage, El Jem and Le Bardo as historic sites. Tourist activity is focused on the historic sites and monuments of the city of Kairouan.\n\nFood\nKairouan is known for its pastries (e.g. zlebia and makroudh).\n\nIn popular culture\nKairouan was used as a filming location for the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark, standing in for Cairo. As the film is set in 1936, television antennas throughout the city were taken down for the duration of filming.\n\nNotable people\nSu'da – historically attested Berber princess supposedly died there.\nNajla Bouden – 17th Prime Minister of Tunisia (first female prime minister in the Arab world).\nHabib Galhia, boxer\nHabiba Ghribi, athlete\nFatima al-Fihriya, founder of the first university in the world.\nSalih al-Souissi al-Qayrawani (1871–1941), writer and activist\n\nTwin towns\nGallery\nSee also\nKairouan's significance in Islam\nList of mosques in Kairouan\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nKairouan, tourismtunisia.com\nKairouan World heritage Site, whc.unesco.org\nKairouan University\nAl-Qayrawan, muslimheritage.com\nKairwan, jewishencyclopedia.com\nWorldStatesmen-Tunisia\nKAIROUAN, The Capital of Islamic Culture \nPanoramic virtual tour of Kairouan medina Archived 30 July 2021 at the Wayback Machine",

          "title": "القيروان",
          "content": "القَيْرَوَان ( او )، مدينه تونسيه، تبعد حوالي 160 كيلومتر عن تونس العاصمه والقيروان المعروفه بعاصمه الاغالبه هي اول المدن الاسلاميه المشيده في بلاد المغرب وكان لها دور استراتيجي في الفتح الاسلامي، انطلقت منها حملات الفتح نحو الجزائر والمغرب واسبانيا وافريقيا بالاضافه الى انها رقاد لعدد من صحابه رسول الله محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم ويطلق عليها الفقهاء «رابعه الثلاث،» بعد مكه والمدينه المنوره والقدس وفي هذه المدينه توجد اهم المعالم للقيروان، منها جامع القيروان الكبير و الذي اسسه عقبه بن نافع.\n\nتاريخ القيروان\nيعود تاريخ القيروان الى عام 50 هـ / 670 م، عندما قام بانشائها عقبه بن نافع. وكان هدفه من هذا البناء ان يستقر به المسلمون، اذ كان يخشى ان رجع المسلمون عن اهل افريقيه ان يعودوا الى دينهم. وتعتبر القيروان من اقدم واهم المدن الاسلاميه، بل هي المدينه الاسلاميه الاولى في منطقه المغرب الاسلامي ويعتبر انشاء مدينه القيروان بدايه تاريخ الحضاره العربيه الاسلاميه في المغرب العربي، فلقد كانت مدينه القيروان تلعب دورين هامين في ان واحد، هما: الجهاد والدعوه، فبينما كانت الجيوش تخرج منها للغزو والتوسعات، كان الفقهاء يخرجون منها لينتشروا بين البلاد يعلِّمون العربيه وينشرون الاسلام. فهي بذلك تحمل في كلّ شبر من ارضها عطر مجد شامخ وارثا عريقا يؤكده تاريخها الزّاهر ومعالمها الباقيه التي تمثل مراحل هامه من التاريخ العربي الاسلامي. لقد بقيت القيروان حوالي اربعه قرون عاصمه الاسلام الاولى لافريقيه والاندلس ومركزا حربيّا للجيوش الاسلاميه ونقطه ارتكاز رئيسيه لاشاعه اللغه العربيه. وعندما تذكر القيروان يذكر القائد العربي الكبير عقبه بن نافع وقولته المشهوره عندما بلغ في توسعاته المحيط الاطلسي وهو يرفع يده الى السماء ويصرخ باعلى صوته : «اللهم اشهد اني بلغت المجهول ولولا هذا البحر لمضيت في البلاد اقاتل من كفر بك حتى لا يعبد احد من دونك». تقع القيروان في تونس على بُعد 160 كم من العاصمه تونس. وكلمه القيروان كلمه فارسيه دخلت الى العربيه، وتعني مكان السلاح ومحط الجيش او استراحه القافله وموضع اجتماع الناس في الحرب..\n\nاصل التسميه\nيرجع اصل كلمه «القيروان» الى كلمه «کاروان» الفارسيه، والتي تعني الرَّتْل العسكري او القافله. وهي نفسها الكلمه التي اعطت «caravane» الفرنسيه.\n\nاختيار موقع القيروان\nاجتمع عقبه بن نافع بعد انتهائه من بناء مدينه القيروان بوجود اصحابه واهل العسكر فدار بهم حول مدينه القيروان، واقبل يدعو لها ويقول في دعائه: اللهم املاها علما وفقها، واعمرها بالمطيعين والعابدين، واجعلها عزا لدينك وذلا لمن كفر بك، واعز بها الاسلام.\nفلما ارسى عقبه بن نافع قواعد مدينته الجديده، لم يكن يدري وهو يدعو ربّه ليمنعها من جبابره الارض ويملاها فقهاً وعلماً ويجعلها عزّاً للاسلام ايّ مصير تخبِّئه لها الايام، الا انه استراتيجياً كان موفَّقاً في اختياره، فالقيروان توجد على مسيره يوم من البحر الذي كان البيزنطيون يسيطرون على عبابه، وهي تبعد بمثل ذلك عن الجبال، حيث كانت انذاك تعتصم القبائل البربريه المناوئه للاسلام، وتمثل القاعده المحدثه راس الحربه وسط خط المواجهه المتخذ بين المسلمين والبيزنطيين، بعد انهزام ملكهم جرجير في سبيطله امام جيوش معاويه بن حديج سنه 45 هـ، 665 م وتراجع سلطانهم وانحصاره في شمال البلاد.\nبجانب ذلك فالقيروان في منبسط من الارض مديد يسمح باستنفار الفرسان في غير صعوبه، وقد كانت الخيل قوام جيش المسلمين في جُلّ معاركهم وحروبهم المصيريه، وقد راعى عقبه في اختياره لموقع مدينته الجديده تقريبها من السبخه حتى يوفّر ما تحتاجه الابل من المراعي، وتسميه القيروان تستجيب للغرض الاصلي من تاسيسها فهي كلمه معرَّبه عن اللغه الفارسيه وتعني المعسكر او القافله او محط اثقال الجيش.\nولا ريب ان مختلف الحملات والغزوات التي سبقت بناء القيروان كانت تمر بالموقع، وتتّفق المصادر على ان معاويه بن حديج قد عسكر خلال احدى حملاته الثلاث على افريقيّه بالموضع المعروف بالقرن على بعد عشره كيلومترات شمال غربي القيروان، كما تذكر كتب الطبقات ان الصحابي ابا زمعه البلوي قد استشهد خلال غزوه معاويه بن حديج الاولى العام 34 هـ، 654 م وهو محاصر لجلوله، فاُخذ ودُفن بموضع القيروان\n\nالمكانه العلميه للقيروان\nكانت القيروان اولى المراكز العلميه في المغرب العربي تليها قرطبه في الاندلس ثم فاس في المغرب الاقصى ولقد قصدها ابناء المغرب وغيرها من البلاد المجاوره. وكان مسجد عقبه الجامع ومعه بقيه مساجد القيروان تعقد فيه حلقات للتدريس وانشئت مدارس جامعه اطلقوا عليها (دور الحكمه). واستقدم لها العلماء والفقهاء ورجال الدعوه من الشرق فكانت هذه المدارس وما اقترن به انشاؤها من انصراف القائمين عليها للدرس والبحث عاملا في رفع شان لغه القران لغه العرب وثقافتهم.\nولقد كان للقيروان دور كبير في نشر وتعليم الدين وعلومه بحكم ما علق على هذه المدينه من امال في هدايه الناس وجلبهم الى افريقيه وهي نقطه هامه لاحظها الفاتحون منذ ان استقر رايهم على انشاء مدينه القيروان، فعندما عزم عقبه بن نافع ومن معه على وضع محراب المسجد الجامع فكروا كثيرا في متجه القبله، وراقبوا طلوع الشمس وغروبها عده ايام. وقال له اصحابه:\n\nواصبح محراب القيروان اسوه وقدوه لبقيه مساجد المغرب الاسلامي بمعناه الواسع حتى ان محمد بن حارث الخشني بعد ان قدم من القيروان الى سبته وشاهد انحراف مسجدها عن قبله الصلاه عدله وصوبه.\nوفي عهد الخليفه الاموي عمر بن عبد العزيز (99-101 هـ / 717 -720م) اراد تثقيف اهل المغرب وتعليمهم امر دينهم فجعل من مدينه القيروان مركزا للبعثه العلميه المكونه من عشره اشخاص من التابعين فارسلهم الى افريقيه حيث انقطعوا الى تعليم السكان امور الدين، ومات غالب افراد البعثه في مدينه القيروان نفسها.\nوهكذا اصبحت مدينه القيروان مركزا للعلم في المغرب الاسلامي حتى كانت مفخره المغرب. ومنها خرجت علوم المذهب المالكي، والى ائمتها كل عالم ينتسب وكان قاضي القيروان يمثل اعلى منصب ديني في عموم البلاد المغربيه، واليه المرجع في تسميه قضاه مختلف الجهات.\nو اسهمت القيروان في عهد الاغالبه في نشر المذهب المالكي في ارجاء الدوله الاغلبيه، ومنها انتشر في صقليه والاندلس. وقد تم ذلك على يد الامام سحنون (160-240 هـ / 777 -855م)، واقرانه وتلاميذه. فهؤلاء كانوا يلتزمون المذهب المالكي، اذ انهم كانوا يذهبون لاداء فريضه الحج، ثم يلزمون الامام مالك بن انس في المدينه المنوره، فتاثروا بفقهه. وقد ولي سحنون قضاء القيروان (234-240 هـ / 848 -854 م)، فكان صاحب النفوذ الاكبر لا في شئون القضاء فحسب، بل في جميع شئون الدوله. ولما عاد سحنون من المدينه المنوره كان قد وضع اسس الكتاب الذي دونه ويسمى المدونه التي اصبحت قاعده التدريس في المغرب الادنى، ومن هناك انتقلت الى الاندلس. وكانت الكتب الفقهيه التي الفها علماء القيروان ابتداء من كتاب المدونه لصاحبه الفقيه الكبير سحنون والذي اصبح مرجعا دينيا لرجال القيروان، الى رساله ابن ابي زيد ونوادره وزياداته الى تهذيب ابي سعيد البراذعي، كانت هذه الكتب وامثالها عمده الدارسين والشراح والمعلقين لا يعرفون غيرها الى المائه السابعه من التاريخ الهجري عندما ابتدات كتب المشارقه تاتي الى المغرب مثل مختصر ابن الحاجب ومختصر خليل فيما بعد.\n\nبيت الحكمه\nانشئت في القيروان المكتبات العامه والمكتبات الملحقه بالجوامع والمدارس والزوايا وكانت مفتوحه للدارسين وتضم نفائس امهات الكتب. ومن اشهر مكتبات القيروان بيت الحكمه الذي انشاه ابراهيم الثاني 261-289 هـ / 875 -902 م. في رقاده بالقيروان محاكاه لبيت الحكمه التي اسسها هارون الرشيد في بغداد حيث كانت هذه البيت نواه لمدرسه الطب القيروانيه التي اثرت في الحركه العلميه في المغرب لزمن طويل.\nوقد استقدم ابراهيم بن احمد الاغلبي اعدادا كبيره من علماء الفلك والطب والنبات والهندسه والرياضيات من المشرق والمغرب وزوده بالالات الفلكيه. وكان ابراهيم بن احمد يبعث كل عام (واحيانا كل سته اشهر) بعثه الى بغداد هدفها تجديد ولائه للخلافه العباسيه واقتناء نفائس الكتب المشرقيه في الحكمه والفلك مما لا نظير له في المغرب واستقدام مشاهير العلماء في العراق ومصر. وعلى هذا النحو امكنه في امد قصير ان يقيم في رقاده نموذجا مصغرا من بيت الحكمه في بغداد، ولم يلبث هذا البيت ان وقع في ايدي الفاطميين بعد سنوات معدوده من وفاته.\nولقد كان بيت الحكمه معهدا علميا للدرس والبحث العلمي والترجمه من اللاتينيه، ومركزا لنسخ المصنفات، وكان يتولى الاشراف عليه حفظه مهمتهم السهر على حراسه ما يحتويه من كتب، وتزويد الباحثين والمترددين عليه من طلاب العلم بما يلزمهم من هذه الكتب حسب تخصصاتهم، ويراس هؤلاء الحفظه ناظر كان يعرف بصاحب بيت الحكمه.\nواول من تولى هذا المنصب عالم الرياضيات ابو اليسر ابراهيم بن محمد الشيباني الكاتب المعروف بابي اليسر الرياضي، وهو بغدادي النشاه، حيث اتيح له ان يلتقي بالعديد من المحدثين والفقهاء والادباء واللغويين. وكان قد تنقل في اقطار المشرق قبل انتقاله الى الاندلس واخيرا استقر بالقيروان.\nوكان الامير ابراهيم بن احمد يعقد المجالس العلميه للمناظره في بيت الحكمه، وكان يحضر هذه المجالس العلماء البارزون من فقهاء المالكيه والحنفيه.\n\nالمساجد\nيعد مسجد القيروان الذي بناه عقبه بن نافع عند انشاء المدينه من اهم معالمها عبر التاريخ. ولقد بدا المسجد صغير المساحه، بسيط البناء، ولكن لم يمض على بنائه عشرون عاما حتى هدمه حسان بن نعمان الغساني واقام مكانه مسجدا جديدا اكبر من الاول. وفي عهد الخليفه هشام بن عبد الملك امر بزياده مساحته، واضاف اليه حديقه كبيره في شماله، وجعل له صهريجا للمياه، وشيد ماذنه.\nوفي عام 155 هـ / 724 م اعيد بناؤه على يد يزيد بن حاتم، وظل على حاله هذه الى ان تولى\nزياده الله بن ابراهيم بن الاغلب اماره افريقيه عام 201 هـ / 817 م فزاد فيه. ولقد سارت التوسعات في العصور المختلفه حتى اصبح يشغل اليوم مساحه مستطيله تتراوح اضلاعها ما بين (70 و122) مترا.\nويعتبر جامع القيروان من اقدم مساجد المغرب الاسلامي والمصدر الاول الذي اقتبست منه العماره المغربيه والاندلسيه عناصرها الزخرفيه والمعماريه. كما كان هذا المسجد ميدانا للحلقات الدينيه والعلميه واللغويه التي ضمت نخبه من اكبر علماء ذلك العصر.\n\nمن اعلام القيروان\nلقد تميّز كل عصر من عصور القيروان بعدد وافر من الاسماء والاعلام في شتى ضروب العلم والمعرفه لمّْا كانت عاصمه المغرب العربي واعظم مدن القاره الافريقيه ومناره عاليه للاشعاع الفكري والديني والحضاري في عصور الاغالبه والفاطميين والصنهاجيين. ومن هؤلاء الاعلام الامام سحنون وابن رشيق القيرواني وابن شرف واسد بن الفرات وابن الجزار.\nلكن المهتمين بالتاريخ يذكرون خصوصا اسم المعزّ بن باديس الصنهاجي كاكبر رمز لما بلغته القيروان من حضاره في عهد الصنهاجيين وعبد الله بن الاغلب الذي جعل من القيروان اسما ملا الدنيا، اما عقبه بن نافع فانه يظل الفاتح والمؤسس.\nكان من اوائل من قام بالتعليم في مدينه القيروان اولئك العشره من التابعين الذين ارسلهم عمر بن عبد العزيز ليعلموا الناس وكان من اشهر اولئك العشره اسماعيل بن عبيد الله بن ابي المهاجر الذي كان -بالاضافه الى انه عامل للخليفه- من اكثر افراد تلك البعثه اندفاعا في نشر الدين وادخال البربر الى الاسلام.\nوكان منهم عبد الله بن يزيد الحُبُلي الذي شهد الاستيلاء على الاندلس مع موسى بن نصير، ثم عاد الى القيروان ومات فيها.\nومنهم ايضا اسماعيل بن عبيد المشهور بلقب «تاجر الله» وهو الذي بنى المسجد المعروف باسم مسجد الزيتونه، كما بنى سوقا للتجاره عرفت باسم سوق اسماعيل. وقد استشهد غريقا في احدى الغزوات البحريه لصقليه سنه 107 هـ / 726 م، ومنهم عبد الرحمن بن رافع التنوخي اول من تولى القضاء بمدينه القيروان.\nواما رواد الفقه في القيروان فهم كثير منهم الامام سحنون بن سعيد الفقيه صاحب ابي القاسم - تلميذ الامام مالك - ومؤلف كتاب المدونه والذي كان له دور كبير في تدوين المذهب المالكي، وقد حضر دروس هذا الفقيه العديد من طلاب الاندلس الذين قاموا بنشر مذهبه فيما بعد.\nوقد عرفت من رجال الفقه كذلك اسد بن الفرات قاضي افريقيه في عهد الاغالبه وقائد الحمله الى صقليه وفاتح الجزيره ومحمد ابن الامام سحنون بن سعيد وابن ابي زيد القيرواني.\nكما اشتهر فيها من الشعراء: ابو عبد الله القزاز القيرواني، والحسين بن رشيق القيرواني، وابن هانئ الاندلسي.\nوكان من بين علمائها عبد الكريم النهشلي عالم اللغه وكان من اهل الادب ابو اسحاق (الحصري) القيرواني صاحب زهر الاداب.\nاما عن مدرسه الطب فقد اشتهرت منها اسره ابن الجزار التي توارثت الطب ابا عن جد.\n\nدورها\nلعبت مدينه القيروان دورا رئيسيا في القرون الاسلاميه الاولى، فكانت العاصمه السياسيه للمغرب الاسلامي ومركز الثقل فيه منذ ابتداء الفتح الى اخر دوله الامويين بدمشق. وعندما تاسست الخلافه العباسيه ببغداد رات فيها عاصمه العباسيين خير مساند لها لما اصبح يهدد الدوله الناشئه من خطر الانقسام والتفكك. ومع ظهور عده دول مناوئه للعاصمه العباسيه في المغرب الاسلامي فقد نشات دوله الامويين بالاندلس، ونشات الدوله الرستميه في الجزائر، ونشات الدوله الادريسيه العلويه في المغرب الاقصى.\nوكانت كل دوله من تلك الدول تحمل عداوه لبني العباس خاصه الدوله الادريسيه الشيعيه التي تعتبرها بغداد اكبر خطر يهددها. لهذا كله راى هارون الرشيد ان يتخذ سدا منيعا يحول دون تسرب الخطر الشيعي. ولم ير الا عاصمه افريقيه قادره على ذلك، فاعطى لابراهيم بن الاغلب الاستقلال في النفوذ وتسلسل الاماره في نسله.\nوقامت دوله الاغالبه (184-296هـ / 800 -909م) كوحده مستقله ومدافعه عن الخلافه. وقد كانت دوله الاغالبه هذا الدرع المنيع ايام استقرارها، ونجحت في ضم صقليه الى ملكها عام 264 هـ / 878 م، وقام امراؤها الاوائل باعمال بنائيه ضخمه في القيروان ذاتها ومنها توسيع الجامع في القيروان، وتوسيع الجامع في تونس، كما عمل الاغالبه على الاهتمام بالزراعه والري في المنطقه، واقاموا الفسقيه المشهوره.\nوقد استغل الامراء الاغالبه تلك المكانه واتخذوها سلاحا يهددون به عاصمه بغداد كلما هم خليفه من خلفائها بالتقليل من شان الامراء الاغالبه او انتقاص سيادتهم. وهذا ما فعله زياده الله بن الاغلب مع الخليفه المامون العباسي. فقد اراد هذا الاخير الحاق القيراون بولايه مصر، وطلب من زياده الله ان يدعو لعبد الله بن طاهر بن الحسين والي المامون على مصر فادخل زياده الله رسول المامون اليه، وقال له: ان الخليفه يامرني بالدعاء لعبد خزاعه. هذا لا يكون ابدا ثم مد يده الى كيس بجنبه فيه الف دينار ودفعه للرسول. وكان في الكيس دنانير مضروبه باسم الادارسه في المغرب ؛ ففهم المامون مقصد الامير الاغلبي فكف عن محاولته ولم يعد اليها.\nوبسبب هذه المكانه فقد عمل على التقرب منها اكبر ملك في اوروبا اذ بعث الامبراطور شارلمان بسفرائه الى ابراهيم بن الاغلب فقابلهم في دار الاماره بالعباسيه في ابهه عجيبه بالرغم من الصلات الوديه التي كانت بين هذا الامبراطور والخليفه العباسي هارون الرشيد.\nوفي عهد ولايه ابراهيم بن احمد بن محمد بن الاغلب (261 - 289 هـ / 875 -902 م) بدات الفتن تدب بين امراء الاغالبه. وكان ابراهيم بن احمد سفاحا لم تسلم منه عامه الناس ولا اقرب الناس اليه وكان غدره بسبعمائه من اهل بلزمه سنه 280 هـ / 894 م سببا من اسباب سقوط دوله بني الاغلب. وفي نفس السنه شقت عصا الطاعه في وجه هذا الامير مدن تونس، وباجه، وقموده، وغيرها. وعمت الفوضى ارجاء البلاد بينما الخطر العبيدي الشيعي يزداد يوما بعد يوم. ولما ايقن ابراهيم بن احمد بخطر بني عبيد حاول سنه 289 هـ /902 م تغيير سياسته، فرفع المظالم، واستمال الفقهاء، وبذل الاموال للشعب ولكن بدون جدوى. وفي عهد حفيده زياده الله ازداد خوف بغداد واشتد جزعها من الزحف العبيدي فبعث الخليفه العباسي المكتفي بالله يحث اهل افريقيه على نصره زياده الله فلم يكن لذلك صدى في النفوس وبذل زياده الله الاموال بلا حساب ولكن دون جدوى. فلم يمض على هذا الحادث سوى ثلاث سنوات حتى جاءت معركه الاربس الحاسمه سنه 296 هـ / 909 م وفر على اثرها زياده الله الى\nالمشرق ومعه وجوه رجاله وفتيانه وعبيده. وباستيلاء العبيديين على القيروان جمعوا كل المغرب تحت سيطرتهم فشجعهم ذلك على متابعه السير نحو المشرق. وامكن لهم فيما بعد ان يستولوا على مصر والشام والحجاز. ولولا الظروف السياسيه والوضع الداخلي للفاطميين لاستولوا على بغداد نفسها.\n\nوعندما انتقل بنو عبيد الى مصر ووصل المعز لدين الله الفاطمي القاهره عام 362 هـ / 973 م اهتموا بالقيروان واتخذوها مركزا لنائبهم في افريقيه، وعهدوا اليه بالسهر على حفظ وحده المغرب والسيطره عليه. واستخلف المعز الفاطمي بلكين بن زيري الصنهاجي على افريقيه، وكتب الى العمال وولاه الاشغال بالسمع والطاعه له فاصبح اميرا على افريقيه والمغرب كله، وقام بلكين وخلفاؤه بقمع الثورات التي حصلت خاصه في المغرب في قبائل زناته.\nواستمر المغرب في وحدته الصنهاجيه وتبعيته الى مصر الفاطميه الى ان انقسم البيت الصنهاجي على نفسه فاستقل حماد الصنهاجي عن القيروان متخذا من القلعه التي بناها قاعده لامارته. وكان هذا الانقسام السياسي خير ممهد لظهور دوله المرابطين في المغرب الاقصى. كما كان لهذا الانقسام نتائجه الاليمه فيما بعد عندما اعلن المعز ابن باديس الصنهاجي استقلاله عن الفاطميين، فبعثوا اليه بقبائل الاعراب من الهلاليين فمزق شمل الدوله، وقضى على معالم الحضاره، وخربت القيروان، ولم تعد العاصمه السياسيه القويه او مركزا تشع منه المعارف والعلوم والاداب.\nالشيخ عبد الرحمن خليف (27 ماي 1917 - 19 فيفري 2006)\n\nالمدينه الحديثه\nاحدى اهم المدن التونسيه ومقر الولايه (117.903 الف نسمه، عام 2004).

          "content": "The Great Mosque of Kairouan (Arabic: جامع القيروان الأكبر), also known as the Mosque of Uqba (جامع عقبة بن نافع), is a mosque situated in the UNESCO World Heritage town of Kairouan, Tunisia and is one of the largest Islamic monuments in North Africa. \nEstablished by the Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi in 50 AH (670/671 CE) at the founding of the city of Kairouan, the mosque occupies an area of over 9,000 square metres (97,000 sq ft).  It is one of the oldest places of worship in the Islamic world, and is a model for all later mosques in the Maghreb. Its perimeter, of about 405 metres (1,329 ft), contains a hypostyle prayer hall, a marble-paved courtyard and a square minaret. In addition to its spiritual prestige, the Mosque of Uqba is one of the masterpieces of Islamic architecture, notable among other things for the first Islamic use of the horseshoe arch.\nExtensive works under the Aghlabids two centuries later (9th Cent.AD/CE) gave the mosque its present aspect. The fame of the Mosque of Uqba and of the other holy sites at Kairouan helped the city to develop and expand. The university, consisting of scholars who taught in the mosque, was a centre of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences. Its role at the time can be compared to that of the University of Paris in the Middle Ages. With the decline of the city from the mid-11th century, the centre of intellectual thought moved to the University of Ez-Zitouna in Tunis.\n\nLocation\nLocated in the north-east of the medina of Kairouan, the mosque is in the intramural district of Houmat al-Jami (literally \"area of the Great Mosque\"). This location corresponded originally to the heart of the urban fabric of the city founded by Uqba ibn Nafi. However, given the natural lay of the land crossed by several tributaries of the wadis, the urban development of the city spread southwards. Human factors including Hilalian's invasions in 449 AH (1057 AD) led to the decline of the city and halted development. For all these reasons, the mosque which once occupied the center of the medina when first built in 670 is now on the easternmost quarter abutting the city walls.\n\nHistory\nEvolution\nAt the foundation of Kairouan in 670, the Arab general and conqueror Uqba ibn Nafi (himself the founder of the city) chose the site of his mosque in the center of the city, near the headquarters of the governor. Around 690, shortly after its construction, the mosque was destroyed during the occupation of Kairouan by the Berbers, originally conducted by Kusaila. It was rebuilt by the Ghassanid general Hasan ibn al-Nu'man in 703. With the gradual increase of the population of Kairouan and the consequent increase in the number of faithful, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, Umayyad Caliph in Damascus, charged his governor Bishr ibn Safwan to carry out development work in the city, which included the renovation and expansion of the mosque around the years 724–728. During this expansion, he pulled down the mosque and rebuilt it with the exception of the mihrab. It was under his auspices that the construction of the minaret began. In 774, a new reconstruction accompanied by modifications and embellishments took place under the direction of the Abbasid governor Yazid ibn Hatim.\nUnder the rule of the Aghlabid dynasty, Kairouan was at its apogee, and the mosque profited from this period of stability and prosperity. In 836, Emir Ziyadat Allah I reconstructed the mosque once more: this is when the building acquired, at least in its entirety, its current appearance. At the same time, the mihrab's ribbed dome  was raised on squinches. Around 862–863, Emir Abu Ibrahim enlarged the oratory, with three bays to the north, and added the cupola over the arched portico which precedes the prayer hall. In 875 Emir Ibrahim II built another three bays, thereby reducing the size of the courtyard which was further limited on the three other sides by the addition of double galleries.\nThe current state of the mosque can be traced back to the Aghlabid period—no element is earlier than the ninth century besides the mihrab—except for some partial restorations and a few later additions made in 1025 during the Zirid period, 1248 and 1293–1294 under the reign of the Hafsids, 1618 at the time of Muradid beys, and in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. In 1967, major restoration works, executed during five years and conducted under the direction of the National Institute of Archeology and Art, were achieved throughout the monument, and were ended with an official reopening of the mosque during the celebration of the Mawlid of 1972.\n\nHost stories\nSeveral centuries after its founding, the Great Mosque of Kairouan is the subject of numerous descriptions by Arab historians and geographers in the Middle Ages. The stories concern mainly the different phases of construction and expansion of the sanctuary, and the successive contributions of many princes to the interior decoration (mihrab, minbar, ceilings, etc.). Among the authors who have written on the subject and whose stories have survived are Al-Bakri (Andalusian geographer and historian who died in 1094 and who devoted a sufficiently detailed account of the history of the mosque in his book Description of Septentrional Africa), Al-Nuwayri (historian who died in Egypt, 1332) and Ibn Nagi (scholar and historian of Kairouan who died around 1435).\nOn additions and embellishments made to the building by the Aghlabid emir Abu Ibrahim, Ibn Nagi gives the following account: « He built in the mosque of Kairouan the cupola that rises over the entrance to the central nave, together with the two colonnades which flank it from both sides, and the galleries were paved by him. He then made the mihrab. »\nAmong the Western travelers, poets and writers who visited Kairouan, some of them leave impressions and testimonies sometimes tinged with emotion or admiration on the mosque. From the eighteenth century, the French doctor and naturalist John Andrew Peyssonnel, conducting a study trip to 1724, during the reign of sovereign Al-Husayn Bey I, underlines the reputation of the mosque as a deemed centre of religious and secular studies: « The Great Mosque is dedicated to Uqba, where there is a famous college where we will study the remotest corners of this kingdom : are taught reading and writing of Arabic grammar, laws and religion. There are large rents for the maintenance of teachers. » \nAt the same time, the doctor and Anglican priest Thomas Shaw (1692–1751), touring the Tunis Regency and passes through Kairouan in 1727, described the mosque as that: \"which is considered the most beautiful and the most sacred of Berberian territories\", evoking for example: \"an almost unbelievable number of granite columns\".\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, the French writer Guy de Maupassant expresses in his book La vie errante (The Wandering Life), his fascination with the majestic architecture of the Great Mosque of Kairouan as well as the effect created by countless columns: \"The unique harmony of this temple consists in the proportion and the number of these slender shafts upholding the building, filling, peopling, and making it what it is, create its grace and greatness. Their colorful multitude gives the eye the impression of unlimited\". Early in the twentieth century, the Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke describes his admiration for the minaret: « Is there a more beautiful than this still preserved old tower, the minaret, in Islamic architecture? In the history of Art, its three-storey minaret is considered such a masterpiece and a model among the most prestigious monuments of Muslim architecture. »\n\nArchitecture\nGeneral layout\nThe building is a vast slightly irregular quadrilateral covering some 9,000 m2. It is longer (127.60 metres) on the east side than the west (125.20 metres), and shorter on the north side (72.70 metres) than the south (78 metres). It consists mainly of an interior prayer hall to the south preceded by a large courtyard (sahn) to the north. The main minaret is centered on the north side of the courtyard.\n\nExterior\nEnclosure\nFrom the outside, the Great Mosque of Kairouan is a fortress-like building with its 1.90 metres thick massive ocher walls, a composite of well-worked stones with intervening courses of rubble stone and baked bricks. The corner towers measuring 4.25 metres on each side are buttressed with solid projecting supports. Structurally given the soft grounds subject to compaction, the buttressed towers added stability to the entire mosque. Despite the austere façades, the rhythmic patterns of buttresses and towering porches, some surmounted by cupolas, give the sanctuary a sense of striking sober grandeur.\nToday, the enclosure of the Great Mosque of Kairouan is pierced by nine gates (six opening on the courtyard, two opening on the prayer hall and a ninth allows access to the maqsura) some of them, such as Bab Al-Ma (gate of water) located on the western façade, are preceded by salient porches flanked by buttresses and surmounted by ribbed domes based on square tholobate which are porting squinches with three vaults. However, Arab geographers and historians of the Middle Ages Al-Muqaddasi and Al-Bakri reported the existence, around the tenth and eleventh centuries, of about ten gates named differently from today. This reflects the fact that, unlike the rest of the mosque, the enclosure has undergone significant changes to ensure the stability of the building (adding many buttresses). Thus, some entries have been sealed, while others were kept.\nDuring the thirteenth century, new gates were opened, the most remarkable, Bab Lalla Rihana dated from 1293, is located on the eastern wall of the enclosure. The monumental entrance, work of the Hafsid sovereign Abu Hafs `Umar ibn Yahya (reign from 1284 to 1295), is entered in a salient square, flanked by ancient columns supporting horseshoe arches and covered by a dome on squinches. The front façade of the porch has a large horseshoe arch relied on two marble columns and surmounted by a frieze adorned with a blind arcade, all crowned by serrated merlons (in a sawtooth arrangement). Despite its construction at the end of the thirteenth century, Bab Lalla Rihana blends well with all of the building mainly dating from the ninth century.\n\nCourtyard\nThe courtyard is a vast trapezoidal area whose interior dimensions are approximately 67 by 52 metres. It is surrounded on all its four sides by a portico with double rows of arches, opened by slightly horseshoe arches supported by columns in various marbles, in granite or in porphyry, reused from Roman, Early Christian or Byzantine monuments particularly from Carthage. Access to the courtyard by six side entrances dating from the ninth and thirteenth centuries.\nThe portico on the south side of the courtyard, near the prayer hall, includes in its middle a large dressed stone pointed horseshoe arch which rests on ancient columns of white veined marble with Corinthian capitals. This porch of seven metres high is topped with a square base upon which rests a semi-spherical ribbed dome; the latter is ribbed with sharp-edged ribs. The intermediary area, the dodecagonal drum of the dome, is pierced by sixteen small rectangular windows set into rounded niches. The great central arch of the south portico, is flanked on each side by six rhythmically arranged horseshoe arches, which fall on twin columns backed by pillars. Overall, the proportions and general layout of the façade of the south portico, with its thirteen arches of which that in the middle constitutes a sort of triumphal arch crowned with a cupola, form an ensemble with \"a powerful air of majesty\", according to the French historian and sociologist Paul Sebag (1919–2004).\n\nDetails of the courtyard\nThe combination formed by the courtyard and the galleries that surround it covers an immense area whose dimensions are about 90 metres long and 72 metres in width. The northern part of the courtyard is paved with flagstones while the rest of the floor is almost entirely composed of white marble slabs. Near its centre is an horizontal sundial, bearing an inscription in naskhi engraved on the marble dating from 1258 AH (which corresponds to the year 1843) and which is accessed by a little staircase; it determines the time of prayers. The rainwater collector or impluvium, probably the work of the Muradid Bey Mohamed Bey al-Mouradi (1686–1696), is an ingenious system that ensures the capture (with the slightly sloping surface of the courtyard) then filtering stormwater at a central basin furnished with horseshoe arches sculpted in white marble. Freed from its impurities, the water flows into an underground cistern supported by seven-metre-high pillars. In the courtyard there are also several water wells some of which are placed side by side. Their edges, obtained from the lower parts of ancient cored columns, support the string grooves back the buckets.\n\nMinaret\nThe minaret, which occupies the centre of the northern façade of the complex's enclosure, is 31.5 metres tall and is seated on a square base of 10.7 metres on each side. It is located inside the enclosure and does not have direct access from the outside. It consists of three tapering levels, the last of which is topped with a small ribbed dome that was most probably built later than the rest of the tower. The first and second stories are surmounted by rounded merlons which are pierced by arrowslits. The minaret served as a watchtower, as well as to call the faithful to prayer.\nThe door giving access to the minaret is framed by a lintel and jambs made of recycled carved friezes of antique origin. There are stone blocks from the Roman period that bear Latin inscriptions. Their use probably dates to the work done under the Umayyad governor Bishr ibn Safwan in about 725 AD, and they have been reused at the base of the tower. The greater part of the minaret dates from the time of the Aghlabid princes in the ninth century. It consists of regular layers of carefully cut rubble stone, thus giving the work a stylistically admirable homogeneity and unity.\nThe interior includes a staircase of 129 steps, surmounted by a barrel vault, which gives access to the terraces and the first tier of the minaret. The courtyard façade (or south façade) of the tower is pierced with windows that provide light and ventilation, while the other three façades—facing north, east and west—are pierced with small openings in the form of arrowslits. The minaret, in its present aspect, dates largely from the early ninth century, about 836 AD. It is the oldest minaret in the Muslim world, and it is also the world's oldest minaret still standing.\nDue to its age and its architectural features, the minaret of the Great Mosque of Kairouan is the prototype for all the minarets of the western Islamic world: it served as a model in both North Africa and in Andalusia. Despite its massive form and austere decoration, it nevertheless presents a harmonious structure and a majestic appearance.\n\nDomes\nThe Mosque has several domes, the largest being over the mihrab and the entrance to the prayer hall from the courtyard. The dome of the mihrab is based on an octagonal drum with slightly concave sides, raised on a square base, decorated on each of its three southern, eastern and western faces with five flat-bottomed niches surmounted by five semi-circular arches, the niche in the middle is cut by a lobed oculus enrolled in a circular frame. This dome, whose construction goes back to the first half of the ninth century (towards 836), is one of the oldest and most remarkable domes in the western Islamic world.\n\nInterior\nPrayer hall\nThe prayer hall is located on the southern side of the courtyard; and is accessed by 17 carved wooden doors. A portico with double row of arches precede the spacious prayer hall, which takes the shape of a rectangle of 70.6 metres in width and 37.5 metres' depth.\nThe hypostyle hall is divided into 17 aisles of eight bays, the central nave is wider, as well as the bay along the wall of the qibla. They cross with right angle in front of the mihrab, this device, named \"T shape\", which is also found in two Iraqi mosques in Samarra (around 847) has been adopted in many North African and Andalusian mosques where it became a feature.\nThe central nave, a sort of triumphal alley which leads to the mihrab, is significantly higher and wider than the other sixteen aisles of the prayer hall. It is bordered on each side of a double row of arches rested on twin columns and surmounted by a carved plaster decoration consisting of floral and geometric patterns.\nEnlightened by chandeliers which are applied in countless small glass lamps, the nave opens into the south portico of the courtyard by a monumental delicately carved wooden door, made in 1828 under the reign of the Husainids. This sumptuous door, which has four leaves richly carved with geometric motifs embossed on the bottom of foliages and interlacing stars, is decorated at the typanum by a stylised vase from which emerge winding stems and leaves. The other doors of the prayer hall, some of which date from the time of the Hafsids, are distinguished by their decoration which consists essentially of geometric patterns (hexagonal, octagonal, rectangular patterns, etc.).\n\nColumns and ceiling\nIn the prayer hall, the 414 columns of marble, granite or porphyry (among more than 500 columns in the whole mosque), taken from ancient sites in the country such as Sbeitla, Carthage, Hadrumetum and Chemtou, support the horseshoe arches. A legend says they could not count them without going blind. The capitals resting on the column shafts offer a wide variety of shapes and styles (Corinthian, Ionic, Composite, etc.). Some capitals were carved for the mosque, but others come from Roman or Byzantine buildings (dating from the second to sixth century) and were reused. According to the German archaeologist Christian Ewert, the special arrangement of reused columns and capitals surrounding the mihrab obeys to a well-defined program and would draw symbolically the plan of the Dome of the Rock. The shafts of the columns are carved in marble of different colors and different backgrounds. Those in white marble come from Italy, some shafts located in the area of the mihrab are in red porphyry imported from Egypt, while those made of greenish or pink marble are from quarries of Chemtou, in the north-west of current Tunisia. Although the shafts are of varying heights, the columns are ingeniously arranged to support fallen arches harmoniously. The height difference is compensated by the development of variable bases, capitals and crossbeams; a number of these crossbeams are in cedar wood. The wooden rods, which usually sink to the base of the transom, connect the columns together and maintain the spacing of the arches, thus enhancing the stability of all structures which support the ceiling of the prayer hall.\n\nThe covering of the prayer hall consists of painted ceilings decorated with vegetal motifs and two domes: one raised at the beginning of the central nave and the other in front of the mihrab. The latter, which its hemispherical cap is cut by 24 concave grooves radiating around the top, is based on ridged horns shaped shell and a drum pierced by eight circular windows which are inserted between sixteen niches grouped by two. The niches are covered with carved stone panels, finely adorned with characteristic geometric, vegetal and floral patterns of the Aghlabid decorative repertoire: shells, cusped arches, rosettes, vine-leaf, etc. From the outside, the dome of the mihrab is based on an octagonal drum with slightly concave sides, raised on a square base, decorated on each of its three southern, Easter and western faces with five flat-bottomed niches surmounted by five semi-circular arches, the niche in the middle is cut by a lobed oculus enrolled in a circular frame.\nThe painted ceilings are a unique ensemble of planks, beams and brackets, illustrating almost thousand years of the history of painting on wood in Tunisia. Wooden brackets offer a wide variety of style and decor in the shape of a crow or a grasshopper with wings or fixed, they are characterised by a setting that combines floral painted or carved, with grooves. The oldest boards date back to the Aghlabid period (ninth century) and are decorated with scrolls and rosettes on a red background consists of squares with concave sides in which are inscribed four-petaled flowers in green and blue, and those performed by the Zirid dynasty (eleventh century) are characterised by inscriptions in black kufic writing with gold rim and the uprights of the letters end with lobed florets, all on a brown background adorned with simple floral patterns.\nThe boards painted under the Hafsid period (during the thirteenth century) offers a floral decor consists of white and blue arches entwined with lobed green. The latest, dated the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (mostly dating from the time of the Muradid Beys), are distinguished by an epigraphic decoration consists of long black and red texts on olive green background to those painted from 1618 to 1619, under the reign of Murad I Bey (1613–1631), while those back to the eighteenth century have inscriptions in white naskhi script on an orange background.\n\nMihrab\nThe mihrab, which indicates the Qibla (direction of Mecca), in front of which stands the imam during the prayer, is located in the middle of the southern wall of the prayer hall. It is formed by an oven-shaped niche framed by two marble columns and topped by a painted wooden half-cupola. The niche of the mihrab is two metres long, 4.5 metres high and 1.6 metres deep.\nThe mosque's mihrab, whose decor is a remarkable witness of Muslim art in the early centuries of Islam, is distinguished by its harmonious composition and the quality of its ornaments. Considered as the oldest example of concave mihrab, it dates in its present state to 862–863 AD.\nIt is surrounded at its upper part by 139 lusterware tiles (with a metallic sheen), each one is 21.1 centimetres square and they are arranged on the diagonal in a chessboard pattern. Divided into two groups, they are dated from the beginning of the second half of the ninth century but it is not determined with certainty whether they were made in Baghdad or in Kairouan by a Baghdadi artisan, the controversy over the origin of this precious collection agitates the specialists. These tiles are mainly decorated with floral and plant motifs (stylised flowers, palm leaves and asymmetrical leaves on bottom hatch and checkered) belong to two series: one polychrome characterised by a greater richness of tones ranging from light gold to light, dark or ocher yellow, and from brick-red to brown lacquer, the other monochrome is a beautiful luster that goes from smoked gold to green gold. The coating around them is decorated with blue plant motifs dating from the eighteenth century or the first half of the nineteenth century. The horseshoe arch of the mihrab, stilted and broken at the top, rest on two columns of red marble with yellow veins, which surmounted with Byzantine style capitals that carry two crossbeams carved with floral patterns, each one is decorated with a Kufic inscription in relief.\nThe wall of the mihrab is covered with 28 panels of white marble, carved and pierced, which have a wide variety of plant and geometric patterns including the stylised grape leaf, the flower and the shell. Behind the openwork hint, there is an oldest niche on which several assumptions were formulated. If one refers to the story of Al-Bakri, an Andalusian historian and geographer of the eleventh century, it is the mihrab which would be done by Uqba Ibn Nafi, the founder of Kairouan, whereas Lucien Golvin shares the view that it is not an old mihrab but hardly a begun construction which may serve to support marble panels and either goes back to work of Ziadet Allah I (817–838) or to those of Abul Ibrahim around the years 862–863. Above the marble cladding, the mihrab niche is crowned with a half dome-shaped vault made of manchineel bentwood. Covered with a thick coating completely painted, the concavity of the arch is decorated with intertwined scrolls enveloping stylised five-lobed vine leaves, three-lobed florets and sharp clusters, all in yellow on midnight blue background.\n\nMinbar\nThe minbar, situated on the right of the mihrab, is used by the imam during the Friday or Eids sermons, is a staircase-shaped pulpit with an upper seat, reached by eleven steps, and measuring 3.93 metres' length to 3.31 metres in height. Dated from the ninth century (about 862) and erected under the reign of the sixth Aghlabid ruler Abul Ibrahim (856–863), it is made in teak wood imported from India. Among all the pulpits of the Muslim world, it is certainly the oldest example of minbar still preserved today. Probably made by cabinetmakers of Kairouan (some researchers also refer to Baghdad), it consists of an assembly of more than 300 finely carved wood pieces with an exceptional ornamental wealth (vegetal and geometric patterns refer to the Umayyad and Abbasid models), among which about 90 rectangular panels carved with plenty of pine cones, grape leaves, thin and flexible stems, lanceolate fruits and various geometric shapes (squares, diamonds, stars, etc.). The upper edge of the minbar ramp is adorned with a rich and graceful vegetal decoration composed of alternately arranged foliated scrolls, each one containing a spread vine-leaf and a cluster of grapes. In the early twentieth century, the minbar had a painstaking restoration. Although it has existed for more than eleven centuries, all panels, with the exception of nine, are originals and are in a good state of conservation, the fineness of the execution of the minbar makes it a great masterpiece of Islamic wood carving referring to Paul Sebag. This old chair of the ninth century is still in its original location, next to the mihrab.\n\nMaqsura\nThe maqsura, located near the minbar, consists of a fence bounding a private enclosure that allows the sovereign and his senior officials to follow the solemn prayer of Friday without mingling with the faithful. Jewel of the art of woodwork produced during the reign of the Zirid prince Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis and dated from the first half of the eleventh century, it is considered the oldest still in place in the Islamic world. It is a cedar wood fence finely sculpted and carved on three sides with various geometric motifs measuring 2.8 metres tall, eight metres long and six metres wide. Its main adornment is a frieze that crowns calligraphy, the latter surmounted by a line of pointed openwork merlons, features an inscription in flowery kufic character carved on the background of interlacing plants. Carefully executed in relief, it represents one of the most beautiful epigraphic bands of Islamic art.\nThe library is near located, accessible by a door which the jambs and the lintel are carved in marble, adorned with a frieze of floral decoration. The library window is marked by an elegant setting that has two columns flanking the opening, which is a horseshoe arch topped by six blind arches and crowned by a series of berms sawtooth.\n\nArtworks\nThe Mosque of Uqba, one of the few religious buildings of Islam has remained intact almost all of its architectural and decorative elements, is due to the richness of its repertoire which is a veritable museum of Islamic decorative art and architecture. Most of the works on which rests the reputation of the mosque are still conserved in situ while a certain number of them have joined the collections of the Raqqada National Museum of Islamic Art; Raqqada is located about ten kilometres southwest of Kairouan.\nFrom the library of the mosque comes a large collection of calligraphic scrolls and manuscripts, the oldest dating back to the second half of the ninth century. This valuable collection, observed from the late nineteenth century by the French orientalists Octave Houdas and René Basset who mention in their report on their scientific mission in Tunisia published in the Journal of African correspondence in 1882, comprises according to the inventory established at the time of the Hafsids (c. 1293–1294) several Qur'ans and books of fiqh that concern mainly the Maliki fiqh and its sources. These are the oldest fund of Maliki legal literature to have survived.\n\nAmong the finest works of this series, the pages of the Blue Qur'an, currently exhibited at Raqqada National Museum of Islamic Art, from a famous Qur'an in the second half of the fourth century of the Hijrah (the tenth century) most of which is preserved in Tunisia and the rest scattered in museums and private collections worldwide. Featuring kufic character suras are written in gold on vellum dyed with indigo, they are distinguished by a compact graph with no marks for vowels. The beginning of each surah is indicated by a band consisting of a golden stylised leafy foliage, dotted with red and blue, while the verses are separated by silver rosettes. Other scrolls and calligraphic Qur'ans, as that known as the Hadinah's Qur'an, copied and illuminated by the calligrapher Ali ibn Ahmad al-Warraq for the governess of the Zirid prince Al-Muizz ibn Badis at about 1020 AD, were also in the library before being transferred to Raqqada museum. This collection is a unique source for studying the history and evolution of calligraphy of medieval manuscripts in the Maghreb, covering the period from the ninth to the eleventh century.\nOther works of art such as the crowns of light (circular chandeliers) made in cast bronze, dating from the Fatimid-Zirid period (around the tenth to the early eleventh century), originally belonged to the furniture of the mosque. These polycandelons, now scattered in various Tunisian museums including Raqqada, consist of three chains supporting a perforated brass plate, which has a central circular ring around which radiate 18 equidistant poles connected by many horseshoe arches and equipped for each of two landmarks flared. The three chains, connected by a suspension ring, are each fixed to the plate by an almond-shaped finial. The crowns of light are marked by Byzantine influence to which the Kairouanese artisan brought the specificities of Islamic decorative repertoire (geometric and floral motifs).\n\nRole in Muslim civilisation\nAt the time of its greatest splendor, between the ninth and eleventh centuries AD, Kairouan was one of the greatest centres of Islamic civilisation and its reputation as a hotbed of scholarship covered the entire Maghreb. During this period, the Great Mosque of Kairouan was both a place of prayer and a centre for teaching Islamic sciences under the Maliki current. One may conceivably compare its role to that of the University of Paris during the Middle Ages.\nIn addition to studies on the deepening of religious thought and Maliki jurisprudence, the mosque also hosted various courses in secular subjects such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine and botany. The transmission of knowledge was assured by prominent scholars and theologians which included Sahnun ibn Sa'id and Asad ibn al-Furat, eminent jurists who contributed greatly to the dissemination of the Maliki thought, Ishaq ibn Imran and Ibn al-Jazzar in medicine, Abu Sahl al-Kairouani and Abd al-Monim al-Kindi in mathematics.

          "summary": "The Great Mosque of Kairouan (Arabic: جامع القيروان الأكبر), also known as the Mosque of Uqba (جامع عقبة بن نافع), is a mosque situated in the UNESCO World Heritage town of Kairouan, Tunisia and is one of the largest Islamic monuments in North Africa. \nEstablished by the Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi in 50 AH (670/671 CE) at the founding of the city of Kairouan, the mosque occupies an area of over 9,000 square metres (97,000 sq ft).  It is one of the oldest places of worship in the Islamic world, and is a model for all later mosques in the Maghreb. Its perimeter, of about 405 metres (1,329 ft), contains a hypostyle prayer hall, a marble-paved courtyard and a square minaret. In addition to its spiritual prestige, the Mosque of Uqba is one of the masterpieces of Islamic architecture, notable among other things for the first Islamic use of the horseshoe arch.\nExtensive works under the Aghlabids two centuries later (9th Cent.AD/CE) gave the mosque its present aspect. The fame of the Mosque of Uqba and of the other holy sites at Kairouan helped the city to develop and expand. The university, consisting of scholars who taught in the mosque, was a centre of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences. Its role at the time can be compared to that of the University of Paris in the Middle Ages. With the decline of the city from the mid-11th century, the centre of intellectual thought moved to the University of Ez-Zitouna in Tunis.",

          "content": "جامع عقبه بن نافع او جامع القيروان الكبير هو مسجد بناه عقبه بن نافع في مدينه القيروان التي اسسها بعد فتح افريقيه (تونس حاليًا) على يد جيشه. كان الجامع حين انشائه على اغلب الظن بسيطاً صغير المساحه تستند اسقفه على الاعمده مباشره، دون عقود تصل بين الاعمده والسقف. وحرص الذين جددوا بناءه فيما بعد على هيئته العامه، وقبلته ومحرابه، وتوسع وزيد في مساحتهِ عده مرات ولقي اهتمام الامراء والخلفاء والعلماء في شتى مراحل التاريخ الاسلامي، حتى اصبح معلماً تاريخياً بارزاً ومهما.\nوبناء الجامع في شكلهِ وحجمهِ وطرازهِ المعماري الذي نراه اليوم يعود اساسا الى عهد\nالدوله الاغلبيه في القرن الثالث هجري اي القرن التاسع ميلادي وقد تواصلت اعمال الصيانه والتحسينات خصوصا في ظل الحكم الصنهاجي ثم في بدايه العهد الحفصي.\nويعتبر المسجد الجامع بالقيروان من اضخم المساجد في الغرب الاسلامي وتبلغ مساحتهُ الاجماليه حوالي 9700 متر مربع، وبقياس ما يقارب 126 متر طولا و 77 متر عرضا، وحرم الصلاه فيهِ واسع ومساحته كبيره يستند الى مئات الاعمده الرخاميه هذا الى جانب صحن فسيح الارجاء تحيط بهِ الاروقه ومع ضخامه مساحته يعد ايضا تحفه معماريه واحد اروع المعالم الاسلاميه.\n\nجامع القيروان يحتوي على كنوز قيمه فالمنبر يعتبر تحفه فنيه رائعه وهو مصنوع من خشب الساج المنقوش ويعتبر اقدم منبر في العالم الاسلامي ما زال محتفظا به في مكانه الاصلي ويعود الى القرن الثالث للهجره اي التاسع ميلادي.\nكذلك مقصوره المسجد النفيسه التي تعود الى القرن الخامس هجري اي الحادي عشر ميلادي وهي ايضا\nاقدم مقصوره ما زالت محتفظه بعناصرها الزخرفيه الاصليه.\nالشكل الخارجي للجامع يوحي للناظر انه حصن ضخم اذ ان جدران المسجد سميكه ومرتفعه وشدت بدعامات واضحه.\nومن اياته ان جمعت بقايا هذه الامم السالفه لتؤلّف بيتا يذكر فيها اسم الله. وهو ما يضفي على جامع القيروان مسحه انسانيه تؤهّله ليصبح تراثا عالميا قد اسهمت في تشييده حضارات متتاليه، وهو يعكس بذلك تاريخ افريقيه على امتداد ثلاثه الاف سنه. فما من امير او خليفه او سلطان يسعى لجميل الذكر وحسن الخلود ويبتغي ثواب ربه الا وقد التمس وجها لاعمار هذا الجامع او ترميمه وتحسين مظهره. فهذا الجامع مراه ناصعه لتجليات الحضاره العربيه الاسلاميه في بلادنا.\nوجامع القيروان يمثّل الوجه المتالّق للعماره القيروانيه التي ظلّت من ابرز روافد العماره المغربيّه والاندلسيه عبر التاريخ حيث اصبح جامع عقبه بن نافع النموذج السائد والمثال الذي تحتذي به الجوامع المغربيّه عامّه والتونسيّه خاصّه. وتقع القيروان في تونس على بُعد 156 كم من العاصمه تونس. وكلمه القيروان كلمه فارسيه دخلت الى العربيه، وتعني مكان السلاح ومحط الجيش او استراحه القافله وموضع اجتماع الناس في الحرب.\n\nتاريخ الجامع\nمثلما بُنيت مدينه القيروان بعد الفتح الاسلامي لشمال افريقيا، بُني جامعها الكبير ويسمونه ايضا جامع عقبه بن نافع نسبه للقائد الاموي الذي اخضع القيروان كليا في حملته الثالثه عليها عام 665م. ويقال ان المدينه شيدت على انقاض حصن للروم ودام بناؤها خمس سنوات انتهى عام 670 م، بعد عام بني الجامع الواقع في الطرف الشمالي من المدينه، فليس «اقدم من المدينه جامعها» كما هو متداول. والحال انهما الاثنان ولدا في زمن واحد قبل ثلاثه عشر قرنا.\nان من ابرز ما جادت به العبقريّه التونسيه عبر العصور: جامع عقبه بن نافع بالقيروان. وهو يعتبر من اروع واجل ماثر الحضاره العربيه الاسلاميه في العالم. وقد ظل هذا المعلم الشامخ يبهر الناظرين والدارسين بتناسق عمارته وتالف عناصره وثراء رصيد الفني وتلالا انواره. فمن اعلى صومعته صاح الرسام العالمي بول كلي « Paul Klee » الان اصبحت رساما وذلك لفرط ما سرى فيه من احساس بالظل النور. واعتبر الاديب الفرنسي قي دي منبسان الذي زار القيروان في اواخر القرن التاسع عشر جامع عقبه بن نافع من روائع الدنيا لما ينطوي عليه من ابراز للعبقريّه الاسلاميه التي استطاعت نحت روحها وعقيدتها الدينيه من خلال شتات من المواد الصخريه المتناثره في اطلال بائده لامم غابره. فالمتامل في العناصر التي اتّخذت في بناء جامع القيروان يقف على مجموعه فريده من الاعمده والتيجان والوسادات المستجلبه من الخرائب الرومانيه والبيزنطيّه اثار حضارات تلاشت واندثرت فيتذكر ارم ذات العماد التي لم يخلق مثلها في البلاد وثمود الذين جابوا الصخر بالواد، كل هذه الحضارات انقرضت ولم يبق الا وجه ربك الواحد الاحد.\nاول من جدد بناء الجامع بعد عقبه هو حسان بن النعمان الغساني الذي هدمه كله وابقى المحراب واعاد بناءه بعد ان وسعه وقوى بنيانه وكان ذلك في عام 80 هـ.\nفي عام 105 هـ طلب الخليفه الاموي هشام بن عبد الملك من واليه على القيروان بشر بن صفران ان يزيد في بناء المسجد ويوسعه، فاشترى بشر ارض شمالي المسجد وضمها اليه، واضاف لصحن المسجد مكانا للوضوء وبنى مئذنه للمسجد في منتصف جداره الشمالي عند بئر تسمى بئر الجنان. وبعدها بخمسين عاما (155 هـ) قام يزيد بن حاتم والي ابي جعفر المنصور على افريقيه باصلاح وترميم وزخرفه المسجد.\nفي عام 221 هـ هدم ثاني امراء الاغلبيين زياده الله بن الاغلب اجزاء من الجامع لتوسعته كما رفع سقفه وبنى قبه مزخرفه بلوحات رخاميه على اسطوانه المحراب. اراد زياده الله ان يهدم المحراب الا ان فقهاء القيروان عارضوه وقالوا له: «ان من تقدمك توقفوا عن ذلك لما كان واضعه عقبه بن نافع ومن كان معه». قال بعض المعماريين: «انا ادخله بين حائطين فيبقى دون ان يظهر في الجامع اثر لغيرك»، فاخذ بهذا الراي وامر ببناء محراب جديد بالرخام الابيض المخرم الذي يطل منه الناظر على محراب عقبه الاساسي.\nفي عام 248 هـ زين احمد بن محمد الاغلبي المنبر وجدار المحراب بلوحات رخاميه وقرميد خزفي. وفي عام 261 هـ وسع احمد الاغلبي الجامع وبنى قبه باب البهو واقام مجنبات تدور حول الصحن. وفي هذه المرحله يعتقد ان الجامع قد وصل الى اقصى درجات جماله.\nفي عام 441 هـ قام المعز بن باديس بترميم المسجد وتجديد بنائه وبنى لهُ مقصوره خشبيه لا تزال موجوده الى يومنا هذا بجانب محراب المسجد. ثم جدد الحفصيون المسجد مره اخرى بعد الغزوه الهلاليه.\nجامع عقبه بن نافع بناه القائد عقبه بن نافع (رضي الله عنه) في مدينه القيروان التي اسسها بعد فتح تونس على يد جيشه المقدام.. كان بسيطاً صغير المساحه، تستند اسقفه على الاعمده مباشره، دون عقود تصل بين الاعمده والسقف.\nوحرص الذين جددوا بناءه فيما بعد على هيئته العامه، وقبلته ومحرابه، وقد تمت زياده مساحته كثيراً، ولقي اهتمام الامراء والخلفاء والعلماء في شتى مراحل التاريخ الاسلامي، حتى اصبح مَعلماً تاريخياً بارزاً ومهماً في تاريخنا العظيم.\nالشكل الخارجي للجامع يوحي للناظر انه حصن ضخم، بسبب جدرانه السميكه والمرتفعه التي شُّدت بدعامات واضحه للعيان.\nاول من جدده حسان بن النعمان الغساني سنه 80هـ، فقد هدمه كله وابقى على المحراب واعاد بناءه بعد ان وسعه وقوى بنيانه.\nوفي عام 105 هـ قام الخليفه الاموي هشام بن عبد الملك بالطلب من واليه على القيروان بشر بن صفران ان يزيد في بناء المسجد ويوسعه، فقام بشر بشراء ارض شمالي المسجد وضمها اليه، واضاف لصحن المسجد مكاناً للوضوء.\nوبنى مئذنه للمسجد في منتصف جداره الشمالي عند بئر تسمى بئر الجنان، وبعدها بخمسين عاماً (155هـ) قام يزيد بن حاتم والي ابو جعفر المنصور على افريقيه باصلاح وترميم وزخرفه المسجد.\nتعتبر مئذنه جامع عقبه من اجمل الماذن التي بناها المسلمون في افريقيا، تتكون من ثلاث طبقات مربعه الشكل، وفوق الطبقات الثلاث قبه مفصصه، ويصل ارتفاع المئذنه الى 31.5 متراً.\nوتقع في الحائط المواجه لجدار القبله في اقصى الصحن المكشوف، ويدور بداخلها درج ضيق يرتفع كلما ارتفع المبنى متناسباً مع حجمه، ويضيق كلما ارتفعنا لاعلى.\nفي المسجد ست قباب وهي: قبه المحراب، وقبه باب البهو، وقبتان تعلوان مدخل بيت الصلاه، وقبه تعلو المجنبه الغربيه للمسجد، وقبه في اعلى المئذنه.\nلذلك فهو تحفه فنيه نادره الوجود، تدل على عظمه اجدادنا في فن العمار الهندسي الرائع.\n\nمقاييس الجامع\nالمسجد اليوم لا يزال يحتفظ بمقاييسه الاولى التي كان عليها ايام ابراهيم بن احمد الاغلبي، يبلغ طوله 126 متراً وعرضه 77 مترا. وطول بيت الصلاه فيه 70 مترا وعرضه حوالي 38 مترا وصحنه المكشوف طوله 67 وعرضه 56 مترا. ولهذا الصحن مجنبات عرض كل منها نحو سته امتار وربع المتر.\nيغطي بيت الصلاه ثلث مساحه المسجد تقريبا.\nيوحي الجامع للناظر انه حصن ضخم. اذ ان جدرانه سميكه ومرتفعه وشدت بدعامات واضحه. ويتميّز تخطيط الجامع ببساطته فهو يتكوّن من مستطيل منحرف ومبنى في اتّجاه الطول اقتداء بالجوامع العراقيّه ويبلغ طوله بين 127،6و 125.2 وعرضه بين 78م عند جدار القبله و71.70م. ويُعَدُّ بذلك من اكبر المساجد الجامعه الباقيه في الاسلام، واعظمها مظهرًا. وابعاد جامع القيروان تخضع الى العدد الذهبي 62.1 المتعارف لدى الاغريق ثمّ الرومان من بعدهم. وهذا العدد هو المعتمد في التدليل على حسن تناسق الابعاد الهندسيّه لمعلم ما وتناغم احجامه.\n\nالمئذنه والقباب\nالمئذنه\nتعتبر مئذنه جامع عقبه من اقدم واجمل الماذن التي بناها المسلمون في افريقيا. وتعد جميع الماذن التي بنيت بعدها في بلاد المغرب العربي على شاكلتها ولا تختلف عنها الا قليلا، ومن الماذن التي تشبهها مئذنه جامع صفاقس، وماذن جوامع تلمسان واغادير والرباط وجامع القرويين، هذا غير بعض ماذن مساجد الشرق كمئذنه مسجد الجيوشي في مصر.\n\nتتكون المئذنه من ثلاث طبقات كلها مربعه الشكل، والطبقه الثانيه اصغر من الاولى، والثالثه اصغر من الثانيه، وفوق الطبقات الثلاث قبه مفصصه. يصل ارتفاع المئذنه الكليه الى 31.5 متراً.\nتقع المئذنه في الحائط المواجه لجدار القبله في اقصى الصحن المكشوف، وضلع طبقتها الاولى المربعه من اسفل يزيد على 10.5 متر مع ارتفاع يضاهي 19 مترا، وتم بناء الامتار الثلاثه والنصف الاولى منه بقطع حجريه مصقوله، بينما شيد بقيه جسم المئذنه بقطع حجريه مستطيله الشكل كقوالب الاجر.\nالطابق الثاني من المئذنه مزين بطاقات ثلاث مغلقه ومعقوده في كل وجه من اوجه المناره، في حين زين كل وجه من اوجه الطابق الثالث بنافذه حولها طاقتان مغلقتان، ويوجد في اعلى الجدار الاعلى من كل طابق شرفات على هيئه عقود متصله ومفرغه وسطها.\nيدور بداخل المئذنه درج ضيق يرتفع كلما ارتفع المبنى متناسبا مع حجمه حيث يضيق كلما ارتفعنا لاعلى. يعتقد ان هذه المناره لم تبن دفعه واحده، حتى ان الجزء الاول الاضخم منها بني في عهد الخليفه الاموي هشام بن عبد الملك ايام واليه على القيروان بشر بن صفوان، ثم اكملت عمليه البناء بعد مده طويله حيث بني الجزءان الثاني والثالث فوق تلك القاعده الضخمه.\n\nالقباب\nفي مسجد عقبه ست قباب:\n\nقبه المحراب وتعد اقدم قبه بنيت في المغرب الاسلامي.\nقبه باب البهو على مدخل البلاط الاوسط من جهه الصحن، وقد تم الاعتناء بها وزخرفتها بشكل كبير، واعطت توازنا على بيت الصلاه. بعدها، اصبح بناء قبتين في بيوت الصلاه قاعده ثابته في مساجد المغرب الاسلامي.\nقبتان تعلوان مدخل بيت الصلاه في الشرق والغرب.\nقبه تعلو المجنبه الغربيه للمسجد.\nقبه في اعلى المئذنه.\n\nزخارف الجامع\nمن افضل زخارف الجامع زخارف المحراب والقبه التي فوقه. تكسو المحراب زخارف منقوشه على الواح رخاميه يوجد فيها فراغات تسمح بدخول الضوء وقد زين جدار المحراب بمربعات من الخزف ذو البريق المعدني المذهب. تغطي القبه زخارف نباتيه على شكل ساق متوسطه او فروع متموجه تتدلى منها عناقيد من العنب.\nوتغطي القبه زخارف نباتيه على شكل ساق متوسطه او فروع متموجه تتدلى منها عناقيد من العنب، اما المنبر فهو محفور على الخشب وفيه زخارف هندسيه ونباتيه، ويعود عهده الى عام 248هـ.\nاما المنبر فهو محفور على الخشب وفيه زخارف هندسيه ونباتيه، ومصنوع من خشب الساج المستورد من الهند ويتكون من اكثر من 300 لوحه\nمنقوشه تتميز بلونها الزخرفي الفريد وهذا المنبر من ابدع ما انتجته المدرسه القيروانيه\nفي ظل الحكم الاغلبي ويعود عهده الى عام 248 هـ.\nوتعتبر المقصوره التي توجد على يمين المنبر من اقدم المقصورات في العالم الاسلامي\nويعود عهدها الى القرن الخامس هجري اي الحادي عشر ميلادي وقد امر بصنعها الامير المعز بن باديس من سلاله بنو زيري.\nو المقصوره تحفه فنيه من خشب الارز المحفور والمصقول بشكل بديع وقد زينت بنقيشه\nكتبت بالخط الكوفي المورق تعد من اروع النماذج الخطيه في الفن الاسلامي.\nقرابه خمسه وخمسين مجموعه مختلفه النحت والزخرفه والتخريم لتيجان الاعمده في الاروقه المحيطه بصحن المسجد من المرمر الابيض والابيض المشوب بالخضره والحجر الجيري الابيض والابيض المائل للصفره من مناطق مختلفه، من اثار رومانيه وكنائس بيزنطيه.. لم اعثر على تاجين متجاورين متشابهين عدا اعمده باب البهو التي بنيت فيما بعد، في القرن الحادي عشر. ماذا دار في خلد المعماري وهو يناى بعيدا عن التكرار ؟ الم يكن ابن صحراء تتكرر مشاهدها كل يوم منذ الولاده حتى الممات، او ابن مدينه لا يختلف فيها بيت عن جاره ولا نهج عن نهج بما يفضي اليه ؟ كان يدرك ان اللاتماثل واستواء الاضداد انما هو طريق يفضي الى جمال هارب من الفه السياق يكمن في اخاديد الحجر واختلال القياس وغربه التاريخ... جمال يجمع تاجا من مرمر مزينا بصليب وعمودا مزينا بطره مربعه منقوش عليها (لا قوه الا بالله وعليه توكلنا) كان واثقا انهما يرفعان سقف بيت الله بنفس الكفاءه. انه برهان على حقيقه كانت تعنيه بقدر اكبر مما تعنينا الان.\n\nروعه الهندسه المعماريه\nيكشف لنا الجامع الكبير في القيروان عن عماره ذات منطق مغاير وذائقه تستبطن بدائيه ثقافه شعبيه، ثقافه غير مشذبه اهملت ترف العماره المدنيه او على الارجح انها تجهل وسائل تحقيقها. عزز ذلك الواقع ان الحجاره والاعمده التي جلبت من مختلف المناطق التونسيه هي بقايا اثار رومانيه وبيزنطيه وكنائس هدمت في وقتها، فهي مواد مستعمله سابقا بعضها قد تكسر وتشوه شكله بفعل الهدم والنقل البدائي. لقد ادت مجموعه المواد المختلفه وغير المتماثله الى نتائج لم تكن في الحسبان، نتائج لا تنتمي لاسم بعينه ولا لماده محدده ولا لزمن محسوب، حتى ان الجامع ذاته الذي شيده عقبه بن نافع لم يبق منه ذكرى سوى محراب يختفي خلف المحراب الذي بناه بنو الاغلب (يمكن مشاهده محراب عقبه بن نافع عبر خروم المحراب القائم حاليا). انها نتائج لا يمكن ان تركن في زاويه معينه، اذ اسهمت في صياغتها عوامل لا حصر لها مجهول اغلبها.\nوقل في المساجد القديمه مسجد ينافس بصحنه صحن جامع القيروان بقياس اضلاع شكله شبه المربع، وكل ذلك الفضاء الفسيح المبلط برخام حديث لا يكاد يكون للمزاوله الشمسيه الموجوده فيه فوق مبنى صغير الحجم، وكذلك فوهات المواجل الخمس المكونه في اصل تيجان اعمده رخاميه عتيقه ضخمه. وعند مسيل الماء في الصحن تشاهد تلك المصفاه المربعه ذات الدوائر والسطوح المتفاوته لتصفيه مياه الامطار المنحدره الى الخزانات الواسعه الموجوده فيه تحت الصحن.\n\nو للجامع ثمانيه مداخل، اربعه في الجانب الشرقي واربعه في الجانب الغربي وواحد من هذه المداخل فقط في الجانب الشرقي له بهو، اما الرابع فهو من الشمال المعروف باسم باب الله رجانا المنسوب - حسب النقش - الى ابي حفص في عام 693هـ -1294م والثلاثه ابواب الاخرى قائمه في ارتدادات مقنطره ضحله مختلفه العمق ومحاطه باعمده نصف ظاهره، اقواس المدخلين الاولين متشابهه تماما، كلاهما ذو قالب زخرفي ممتد حولها ويشكل عقده في القمه، ثم يمتد حتى يشكل اطارا مستطيلا والنتيجه هو انه شكل نسخه طبق الاصل عن قوس باب الله رجانا. اما الباب الثلاث فان حجارته مستورده تماما بالطلاء الكلسي ولكن قوسه من النوع المدبب البسيط، الذي لا يشبه باي شكل اقواس الجزء القديم من المسجد.\nوتوجد امام الابواب جهه الجانب الغربي بهو صغير مقنطر في الباب الاول والرابع واخر متصالب والاخير بسيط مؤلف من العوارض الخشبيه. والباب الوحيد الخالي نسبيا من الكسوه والطلاء الابيض هو المدخل الرئيسي للحرم المعروف باسم السلطات مقابل باب الله رجانا. والى الجنوب من الباب في الجانب الغربي يوجد ارتداد اخر بعرض (2.75) مترا يعلوه قوس دائري حدودي وهذان المدخلان لابد وانهما كانا على جانب الواجهه القديمه للحرم بما هو الحال في مسجدي دمشق وقرطبه.\n\nتقنيه الاعمده\nكانت الاعمده من اهم الاشياء التي تناولها الفن الاسلامي، وقد اتخذت تيجانًاوعقودًا مدبَّبَه، وروابط خشبيه، حتى انه ظهر ما يُعْرَفُ بعلم عقود الابنيه، وقداصبحت اقواس حدوه الفرس تدلُّ على الفنِّ المعماري الاسلامي، وان وُجِدَتِ الاقواس قبلاً الاَّ انه قد تَغَيَّر شكلها على يد المسلمين.\nاسهمت الحجاره والاعمده متباينه المنشا المستعمله مرارا في مضاعفه حجه العماره على تاكيد نظامها الخاص. فعبر ما يقارب سبعه قرون من الترميم واعاده البناء واستخدام البواقي من المواد تم الحصول على مبنى فريد لا يشبه اي مبنى اخر. كيف نفسر وجود كتله صخريه على الضلع الخارجي للدعامه الثانيه ما قبل الاخيره من جهه بيت الصلاه؟ حجر بيزنطي منحوت يزن اكثر من طن بدا كانه سيسقط ارضا نبت على الجدار، لا تدري مغزاه، ولا وظيفته الانشائيه، فلا تراه الا نزوه، نزوه متطامنه مع استخدام ما تحت يديه من مواد كلها وايجاد مواقع لها في نظامه الخاص.\n\nتقنيه المقرنصات\nكذلك كانت المقرنصات من ابرز خصائص الفنِّ المعماري الاسلامي، وتعني الاجزاء المتدلِّيَه من السقف، والمقرنصات منها داخليه وخارجيه: انتشرت\nالداخليه في المحاريب والسقوف، وكانت الخارجيه في صحون الماذن وابواب القصور والشرفات.\n\nالمشربيات\nكما كان من مظاهر الفنِّ المعماري الاسلامي الظاهره بناء مشربيات البيوت مخرمهً او مزخرفه، وتسمَّى قمريه اذا كانت مستديره، او شمسيه اذا كانت غير مستديره، او حتى شيشًا، وهي من خشب خُرِطَ كستائر للنوافذ، من فوائدها انها تُخَفِّفُ حِدَّه الضوء، وتُمَكِّنُ النساء من مشاهده مَنْ بالخارج دون ان يراهنَّ اَحَدٌ، وقد اصبح ذلك طابع البيوت الاسلاميه.\n\nتاثيرات الفن الاغلبي والفاطمي\nزاوجت القيروان في تخطيطها بين خصوصيه موقعها وعبقريه اهلها اهميه مركزها الديني والحضاري، وقد شابهت في عموم رسومها وبنيانها ما كان ينبغي ان تشبه فيه سائر العواصم والمدن العربيه وكما انطبعت الصناعه الاغلبيه الغالبه بجامع القيروان بالتاثيرات الفنيه الشرقيه والبغداديه فاننا نلاحظ تاثير الفن الفاطمي المصري الواضح في الزخارف الملونه على خشب سقوف عدد من الاروقه. ماعدا سقف الاسكوب القبلي الكبير فهو السقف الوحيد الاصلي الباقي بالجامع، حيث لا تزال الوانه القزحيه تحتفظ بجاذبيتها وتناسبها عبر الاشكال الزهريه التي تحليه. ويختص جامع القيروان بسقوفه الخشبيه المدهونه والمصقوله الراجعه الى فترات تاريخيه مختلفه تمتد بشريطها الكتابي المورق على ما يربو عن الالف سنه. وهي تنضاف الى المقصوره الفريده التي بناها المعز باديس باريس بجامع القيروان حوالي (425هـ) وهي مجموعه متكامله تسمح بتتبع خطوات نشاه الفن التجريدي المعاصر.\n\nالمحراب\nويعد المحراب تحفه المحاريب الاسلاميه في ادنى تفصيل من تفصيلاته وهو الان اقدمها على الاطلاق. وقد صنعت نصف القبه الدائريه باعلاه من الواح متراوحه من افخر خشب الساج. وهي تمتاز بزخرفتها الفنيه الرائعه التي حافظت على تكوينها الزاهي وتذهيبها البديع رغم تقادم الزمن مما يدل على المواد المختاره المستعمله في ذلك. وليس لتلك الاوراق المخمسه والعناقيد المذببه في سمائها من حد لتشابكها وتعانقها الا حدود الرحله الفنيه التي انتهت بها يد الفنان القيرواني. ومهما يطلب من سمات لهذه القبه في معالم فنيه مماثله في الشرق الاموي او الغرب البيزنطي لعهدها فانها تبقى نسيجا وحدها. ويقوم العقد المنصف للقبه على ساريتين حمراوين من الرخام الرفيع يعلوهما تاجان من اجمل ما نقشت التيجان. وفوقهما مسطحان يتوسطهما العقد كتب على رخام كل منهما بالخط الكوفي القيرواني الاصيل: «بسم الله، كفى بالله حسيبا».\nويزين اعلى جدران المحراب وعقده مربعات زخرفيه او (قراميد) تمتاز ببريقها المعدني وعددها (130) قطعه. ولا يعرف اقدم من نوعها في الاسلام. ويقال لها باللسان القيرواني (جليزيات) وقد استقدمها من العراق ابو ابراهيم احمد الاغلبي وزينتها واضحه التاثير بالتقاليد الفارسيه. انها في جبين المحراب وطوقه حليه فريده.\n\nالمنبر\nوعلى يمين المحراب يقوم «اجمل واعرق منبر في الاسلام». وهو من خشب الساج المجلوب، اجزاؤه التي يزيد على الثلاثمائه لوحه منقوشه نقشا دقيقا يذهل المقارن بينهما لاستقلال كل واحده منها، رغم كثرتها، بزينه مخصوصه. وكلها متماسكه من عجب بدون غراء ولا مسامير، لكن بمواشير خشبيه متداخله. وفي مدينه بيونيه، عاصمه السلاجقه منبر يحاكي منبر القيروان ويقاربه في التاريخ. ويضفي ضوء النهار المتعاكس على نقاش تلك اللوحات جمالا باهرا. ولعلها هي الخزف البراق باعلى المحراب صناعه بغداديه قيروانيه متوامه للصله القويه التي كانت في عهد الاغالبه بين العراق وافريقيه.\n\nالمقصوره المعزيه\nوحذو المحراب الساق بالساق تمتد المقصوره المعزيه، نسبه الى المعز لدين الله الصنهاجي الذي بناه في سنه (431هـ / 1023م) واصلحت بعد سته قرون من ذلك التاريخ. ويقدر طولها بثمانيه امتار وارتفاعها بـ (2.80 متر). واحد طوليها حائط القبله نفسه وتفتح من ناحيته على بيت الامام. واما الباب الذي يفضي اليه من جهه بيت الصلاه فله دفتان كبيرتان مطعمتان بالصفائح الغليظه والمسامير المحدودبه . واجمل ما في المقصوره شرفتها المميزه ذات الفتحه المستطيله في الوسط الى جانب هندسه المقصوره نفسها واسلوب خراطه خشبها ونقشه، ومما نقرا في نقش باعلاه: «بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم

افغانستان، بل ان افريز مقصوره القيروان يكاد يكون هو الشبه الامثل.\n\nالصومعه\nومن اجمل ما يميز الصومعه القيروانيه شرفات طابقيها الاول والثاني بما تمنحها وحداتها من تقويس بسيط في عقودها وتساو محكم في المجالات الفاصله بينهما والفراغات المتوسطه بداخلها. ويجلل الطابق الاعلى على قبه مضلعه يظن انها من اضافات العهد الحفصي. (اخر القرن التاسع هـ/ الثالث عشر م). وباعلاها ثلاث كرات نحاسيه متفاوته الحجم وفوقها رسم للهلال من نحاس ايضا رمزا الى مواقيت الاسلام في قوله تعالى «يسالونك عن الاهله قل هي مواقيت للناس».\nوتشير فتحته الى اتجاه القبله . ومن اعلى الصومعه ذات البناء الهرمي اللطيف يستطيع الزائر او المشاهد الاستمتاع بمنظر المدينه الجميل ذات البياض المشرق وما يحيط بها من سهول وله كذلك ان يتامل ابعاد الجامع من جميع جهاته ويشاهد باعجاب قباب بيت الصلاه والابواب الخارجيه الفخمه والعضائد السميكه التي تدعم جداره الخارجي، وفي الوقت نفسه تكثر من حده الشمس وتاثير الرياح عليه، فهي للعائذين به ظلا ودفئا دائمين. وتحيط بباب الصومعه رخامات ثلاث عظيمه الحجم، محفور عليها باشكال نباتيه بديعه. ومن نوادر المسجد ايضا«الزبيبتان» وهما في اصطلاح اهل القيروان الساريتان الكبيرتان الملونتان بلون العنب الجاف القائمتان من كل جانب باخر الرواق الاوسط عند المحراب. ويقال في اعتقاد العامه ان من يجتاز بينهما ييسر الله دخول الجنه. ومهما يكن مصدر ذلك الاعتقاد الا انه غالبا ما يكون عند بسطاء الايمان من اسباب الزياره. وهما الساريتان اللتان قيل ان امبراطور روما عندما علم بهما اعطى وزنهما ذهبا ! وهما من الرخام السماقي او البرفيري.\nيتواصل اليوم اشعاع الجامع المسجد ليبقى المناره التي حملت واشاعت حضاره الدين الاسلامي، وساهمت في تواصل هذه الحضاره.\n\nاقدم من المدينه جامعها\nثمه قول يردده التونسيون يفيد بان جامع القيروان اقدم من مدينها وهو كنايه عن علاقه الجامع بالمدينه.\nوجامع عقبه او جامع القيروان هو اكبر مساجد الاسلام القديمه واول بناء اقيم في افريقيا المسلمه في اول عاصمه اسست لها، وما من امير او خليفه او سلطان يبتغي جميل الذكر وحسن الخلود وخاصه الثواب عند الله الا وقد التمس لوحا من ناحيه من هذا المسجد يسجل فيه ترميما قام به او تحسينا اذن به.\nويعد الجامع من ابرز ما جاءت به العماره القيروانيه، ابده الحضاره الاسلاميه بالمغرب فقد كان محل تعهد من طرف الولاه والامراء الافارقه.\nويعود الفضل لزياده الله الاول في رسم ملامحه وتخطيطه النهائي (220-226 هـ) وهو يشتمل على 17 بلاطه وثمانيه اساكيب ويستمد تخطيطه من الجوامع الامويه مع الاقتداء بجامع الرسول صلى الله وعليه وسلم.\nولمدينه القيروان مكانه خاصه في وجدان الرئيس زين العابدين بن علي الذي حباها وخصها باعتمادات ماليه هامه في مخططات التنميه اعادت لها مجدها وظل اعلامها ورموزها.\nولقد كان من ابرز واحدث مظاهر الاهتمام بجامع القيروان المشروع الرئاسي الكبير الذي شرع في انجازه في شهر نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني 2000. والمتعلق بالاناره الفنيه للجامع بما زاده رونقا واجلالا واظهرت روعه المعمار الذي يختصر به، سيما وان هذه الاناره يمكن ان تكون متحركه لانها تعمل وفق منظومه الكترونيه وتتغير حسب توقيت زمني مبرمج مسبقا وقد انجزت هذا المشروع التحديثي الذي يزيد الجامع بهاء وتالقا بخبرات تونسيه.\nواذا كانت من عاده التونسيين سنويا احياء ذكرى المولد النبوي الشريف في رحاب جامع عقبه فانهم ايضا يفضلون مدينه القيروان في شهر رمضان المبارك للصلاه في جامعها الاعظم ولزياره الاسواق المحيطه به للتعرف على ما تركه الاسلاف من ارث حضاري يحي سيره القيروان مدينه الخشوع ، عاصمه المخزون التراثي الاسلامي لا في تونس فحسب وانما في المغرب العربي وشمال افريقيا.\nويتميز جامع القيروان دون غيره من جوامع العالم الاسلامي التاريخيه بما في ذلك جوامع عواصم الخلافه بالاضافه الى معماره وتركيبته الهندسيه بالمحافظه على اغلب اثاثه الاصلي الذي يرجع الى فتراته الاولى وحسبنا للتدليل على ذلك ان نذكر المنبر الخشبي 298هـ وهو اقدم المنابر الاسلاميه التي سلمت من تقلب الازمان وهو مصنوع من خشب الساج. ويشتمل على ما يربو عن 106 لوحات تحمل زخارف نباتيه وهندسيه بديعه وتعبر عن تمازج التاثيرات البيزنطيه والفارسيه وتوحدها في روح اسلاميه .\n\nتزاوج بين الامس واليوم\nويتالف المسجد من بناء مستطيل كبير، محوره الرئيسي يتجه تقريبا الى الجنوب الشرقي ومظهر غايه في الانتظام والجمال. وترتكز الابواب في الجانب الجنوبي الغربي بين دعامتين في معظم الحالات، وهناك رواق في الفراغ بينهما . والكل مغطى باثار متعدده من الطلاء الكلسي ما عدا الدعائم في الجانب القبلي . وبما ان الارض تنحدر من الشمال الغربي الى الجنوب الشرقي فان الجدران تختلف في الارتفاع من ثمانيه امتار الى حوالي عشره امتار. والسمات الجيده من الخارج هي القباب الخمسه والمئذنه الهائله.\n\nوتتقسم قاعده الحرم الى سبعه عشر جناحا بواسطه سته عشر صفا من الاعمده المتعامده من الجدار الخلفي دون ان تصل اليه، لان صفا عرضانيا يمتد على بعد سته امتار منه، وعلى هذا الاخير تستند الصفو ف السته عشر. ويتالف كل من هذه الصفوف من سبعه اقواس مترابطه بواسطه صفين عرضانيين، يمتدان خلالهما بين القوسين الاول والثاني، والقوسين الرابع والخامس من الواجهه الاصليه على الصحن. ولا يخترق الصف الاخير الرواق المركزي.\nويبلغ متوسط ارتفاع الاعمـده (3.55 مترا) ويترواح قطرها بين (34و44 سم). وتيجان هذه الاعمده من انواع مختلفه. بعض الاعمده لها قواعد، اما اعمده الصف الذي يبطن الجناح المركزي يبلغ متوسط ارتفاعها (4.23 مترا)، والاعمده التي تحمل القبه اكثر ارتفاعا وهي اجمل ما في الحرم بعضها من الرخام الملون الجميل، وبعضها من الرخام الغرانيت، او الرخام السماقي .\nويخيل لمن يطلع على المدينه من مكان مشرف او من صومعه الجامع، وهي اعلى ما هناك ان قيروان الاغالبه والفاطميين وبني زيري هي قيروان اليوم... لو لا شيئا من التضييق في دائره سورها الحسيني الحالي بالقياس الى سورها الاموي القديم، بحيث لو اعيد عليها الان لحّوط على جميع ما تخرم جوانبها حديثا من البناءات والمرافق والمنشات، وربما تجاوزها الى ما وراءها ببعيد... ومن النادر ان تجد او تلمح روعه القدم على مدينه في العصر الحديث في عمر مدينه القيروان.\n\nمشاريع اعمار وتوسعه\nيؤكد الباحثون وعلماء الاثار انه لم يبق من البناء الاول الذي بناه الفاتح عقبه بن نافع من الجامع سنه 50 للهجره سوى المحراب. وهو مورى الان خلف المحراب الاغلبي القائم. ولكن بالامكان مشاهدته من خلال ثقوب زخرفيه فيه مخصصه فيما يبدو لذلك الغرض في لوحات تزينه. اما بناء الجامع الماثل اليوم للعيان فيرجع الى تجديدات عديده وزيادات مختلفه يعود اهمها الى اخر القرن الاول ثم القرنين الثاني والثالث. غير ان الفضل في بقاء محراب عقبه من الطوب الى الاثر المشهور الوارد بحقه.\nوذلك ان عقبه وجماعه الصحابه «اختلفوا عليه في القبله، وقالوا ان جميع اهل المغرب يصنعون قبلتهم على قبله هذا المسجد. فاجهد نفسه في تقويمها. فاقاموا اياما ينظرون الى مطالع الشتاء والصيف من النجوم ومشارق الشمس فلما راى امرهم قد اختلف بات مغموما فدعا الله عز وجل ان يفرج عنه فاتاه ات في منامه فقال له: اذا اصبحت فخذ اللواء في يدك واجعله على عنقك. فانك تسمع بين يديك تكبيرا لا يسمعه احد من المسلمين غيرك فانظر الموضع الذي ينقطع عنك فيه التكبير، فهو قبلتك ومحرابك».\nو تم له ما راى في المنام «فركز لواءه وقال: هذا محرابك».\nويعود الى الفاتح الصحابي حسان بن النعمان بناء الجامع على اثار عقبه بن نافع. فهو الذي اخذ فيه ووسعه اثناء ولايته (74 – 79هـ) بامر من الخليفه الاموي في دمشق هشـام بن عبد الملك، ويقال انه بامر الخليفه هشام بنى بشير بن صفـوان خلال ولايتـه (103 – 109هـ) صومعه الجامع . وعنها يقول البكرى: «بنى الصومعه في بئر الجنان ونصب اساسها على الماء، واتفق ان وقعت في وسط الحائط». والجنان المقصود هو بستان لبني فهر. قوم عقبه.\nوالحائط هو الجدار الخارجي الذي قد يكون عقبه او من بعده خطه للجامع. ويبدو ان اختيار البئر للنصب اساس الصومعه بها راجع الى ما توفره البئر من عمق مناسب واتساع وحجاره صلده في بناءها، خاصه اذا كانت من بناء الاول. اما توسطها للحائط القائمه فيه، وهو الحائط الشمالي، فلم يجعلها مقابله تماما للمحراب المتوسط بطبيعه الحال في الجهه القبليه، بسبب الشكل المستطيل غير المتوازي الاضلاع الذي تهيا للجامع.\n\nصور\nمقالات ذات صله\nقائمه مساجد تونس",

          "content": "Dougga or Thugga or TBGG (Arabic: دقة, romanized: Duqqah; Tunisian Arabic: دڨة, romanized: ) was a Berber, Punic and Roman settlement near present-day Téboursouk in northern Tunisia. The current archaeological site covers 75 hectares (190 acres). UNESCO qualified Dougga as a World Heritage Site in 1997, believing that it represents \"the best-preserved Roman small town in North Africa\". The site, which lies in the middle of the countryside, has been protected from the encroachment of modern urbanization, in contrast, for example, to Carthage, which has been pillaged and rebuilt on numerous occasions. Dougga's size, its well-preserved monuments and its rich Numidian-Berber, Punic, ancient Roman, and Byzantine history make it exceptional. Amongst the most famous monuments at the site are a Libyco-Punic Mausoleum, the Capitol, the Roman theatre, and the temples of Saturn and of Juno Caelestis.\n\nNames\nThe Numidian name of the settlement was recorded in the Libyco-Berber alphabet as TBGG. The Punic name of the settlement is recorded as tbgg (𐤕𐤁‬𐤂‬𐤂‬) and tbgʿg (𐤕𐤁‬𐤂𐤏‬𐤂). The Root B GG in Phoenician means (\"in the roof terrace\"). Camps states that this may represent a borrowing of a Berber word derived from the root tbg (\"to protect\"). This evidently derives from the site's position atop an easily defensible plateau. The name was borrowed into Latin as Thugga. Once it was granted \"free status\", it was formally refounded and known as Municipium Septimium Aurelium Liberum Thugga; \"Septimium\" and \"Aurelium\" are references to the \"new\" town's \"founders\" (conditores), Septimius Severus and M. Aurelius Antoninus (i.e., Caracalla). For treatment of liberum, see below. Once Dougga received the status of a Roman colony, it was formally known as Colonia Licinia Septimia Aurelia Alexandriana Thuggensis.\nIn present-day Berber, it is known as either Dugga or Tugga. That was borrowed into Arabic: دڨة or دقة and Dougga is a French transcription of this Arabic name.\n\nLocation\nThe archaeological site is located 4.6 km (2.9 mi) SSW of the modern town of Téboursouk on a plateau with an uninhibited view of the surrounding plains in the Oued Khalled. The site offers a high degree of natural protection, which helps to explain its early occupation. The slope on which Dougga is built rises to the north and is bordered in the east by the cliff known as Kef Dougga. Further to the east, the ridge of the Fossa Regia, a ditch and boundary made by the Romans after the destruction of Carthage, indicates Dougga's position as a point of contact between the Punic and Berber worlds.\n\nHistory\nDougga's history is best known from the time of the Roman conquest, even though numerous pre-Roman monuments, including a necropolis, a mausoleum, and several temples have been discovered during archaeological digs. These monuments are an indication of the site's importance before the arrival of the Romans.\n\nBerber Kingdom\nThe city appears to have been founded in the 6th century BC. Some historians believe that Dougga is the city of Tocae (Ancient Greek: Τοκαί, Tokaí), which was captured by a lieutenant of Agathocles of Syracuse at the end of the 4th century BC; Diodorus of Sicily described Tocae as \"a city of beautiful grandeur\".\nDougga was in any case an early and important human settlement. Its urban character is evidenced by the presence of a necropolis with dolmens, the most ancient archaeological find at Dougga, a sanctuary dedicated to Ba'al Hammon, neo-Punic steles, a mausoleum, architectural fragments, and a temple dedicated to Masinissa, the remains of which were found during archaeological excavations. Even though our knowledge of the city before the Roman conquest remains very limited, recent archaeological finds have revolutionized the image that we had of this period.\nThe identification of the temple dedicated to Masinissa beneath the forum disproved Louis Poinssot's theory that the Numidian city stood on the plateau but that it was separate from the newer Roman settlement. The temple, which was erected in the tenth year of Micipsa's reign (139 BC), is 14 m × 6.3 m (46 ft × 21 ft) wide. It proves that the area around the forum was already built upon before the arrival of the Roman colonists. A building dating to the 2nd century BC has also been discovered nearby. Similarly, Dougga's mausoleum is not isolated but stands within an urban necropolis.\nRecent finds have disproved earlier theories about the so-called \"Numidian walls\". The walls around Dougga are in fact not Numidian; they are part of the city's fortifications erected in late antiquity. Targeted digs have also proven that what had been interpreted as two Numidian towers in the walls are in fact two funeral monuments from the Numidian era reused much later as foundations and a section of defences.\nThe discovery of Libyan and Punic inscriptions at the site provoked a debate on the administration of the city at the time of the Kingdom of Numidia. The debate—about the interpretation of epigraphic sources—focussed on the question of whether the city was still under Punic influence or whether it was increasingly Berber. Local Berber institutions distinct from any form of Punic authority arose from the Numidian period onwards, but Camps notes that Punic shofets were still in place in several cities, including Dougga, during the Roman era, which is a sign of continuing Punic influence and the preservation of certain elements of Punic civilization well after the fall of Carthage.\n\nRoman Empire\nThe Romans granted Dougga the status of an indigenous city (Latin: civitas) following their conquest of the region.\nThe creation of the colony of Carthage during the reign of Augustus complicated Dougga's institutional status. The city was included in the territory (pertica) of the Roman colony, but around this time, a community (pagus) of Roman colonists also arose alongside the existing settlement. For two centuries, the site was thus governed by two civic and institutional bodies: the city with its peregrini and the pagus with its Roman citizens. Both had Roman civic institutions: magistrates and a council (ordo) of decurions for the city, a local council from the end of the 1st century AD, and local administrators for the pagus, who were legally subordinated to the distant but powerful colony of Carthage. In addition, epigraphic evidence indicates that a Punic-style dual magistracy, the sufetes, achieved some civic stature here well into the imperial period. In fact, the city once had three magistrates serve at once, a relative rarity in the Mediterranean.\nOver time, the romanization of the city brought the two communities closer together. Notable members of the peregrini increasingly adopted Roman culture and behavior, became Roman citizens, and the councils of the two communities began to take decisions in unison. The increasing closeness of the communities was facilitated at first by their geographic proximity—there was no physical distinction between their two settlements—and then later by institutional arrangements. During the reign of Marcus Aurelius, the city was granted Roman law; from this moment onward, the magistrates automatically received Roman citizenship and the rights of the city's inhabitants became similar to those of the Roman citizens. During the same era, the pagus won a certain degree of autonomy from Carthage; it was able to receive bequests and administer public funds.\nNonetheless, it was not until AD 205, during the reign of Septimius Severus, that the two communities came together as one municipality (municipium), made \"free\" (see below) while Carthage's pertica was reduced. The city was supported by the euergetism of its great families of wealthy individuals, which sometimes reached exorbitant levels, while its interests were successfully represented by appeals to the emperors. Dougga's development culminated during the reign of Gallienus, when it obtained the status of a separate Roman colony.\nDougga's monuments attest to its prosperity in the period from the reign of Diocletian to that of Theodosius I, but it fell into a sort of stupor from the 4th century. The city appears to have experienced an early decline, as evidenced by the relatively poor remains of Christianity. The period of Byzantine rule saw the area around the forum transformed into a fort; several important buildings were destroyed in order to provide the necessary materials for its construction.\n\nCaliphate\nDougga was never completely abandoned following the Muslim invasions of the area. For a long time, Dougga remained the site of a small village populated by the descendants of the city's former inhabitants, as evidenced by the small mosque situated in the Temple of August Piety and the small bath dating to the Aghlabid period on the southern flank of the forum.\n\nArchaeological work\nThe first Western visitors to have left eyewitness accounts of the ruins reached the site in the 17th century. This trend continued in the 18th century and at the start of the 19th century. The best-preserved monuments, including the mausoleum, were described and, at the end of this period, were the object of architectural studies.\nThe establishment of France's Tunisian protectorate in 1881 led to the creation of a national antiquities institute (French: Institut national du patrimoine), for which the excavation of the site at Dougga was a priority from 1901, parallel to the works carried out at Carthage. The works at Dougga concentrated at first on the area around the forum; other discoveries ensured that there was an almost constant series of digs at the site until 1939. Alongside these excavations, work was conducted to restore the capitol, of which only the front and the base of the wall of the cella were still standing, and to restore the mausoleum, particularly between 1908 and 1910 .\nAfter Tunisia's independence, other buildings were excavated, including the Temple of Caracalla's Victory in Germany. During the same period, the last inhabitants of the site were evicted and relocated to a village located on the plain several kilometers from the antique site, which is named New Dougga. In 1991, the decision was taken to make the site into a national archaeological park. A cooperative scientific programme aims in particular to promote the study of the inscriptions at the site and the pagan temples. In 1997, Dougga was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.\nDespite its importance and its exceptional state, Dougga remains off the beaten track for many tourists and receives only about 50,000 visitors per year. In order to make it more attractive, the construction of an on-site museum is being considered, while the national antiquities institute has established a website presenting the site and the surrounding region. For the time being, visitors with sufficient time can appreciate Dougga, not only because of its many ruins but also for its olive groves, which give the site a unique ambiance.\n\nDougga's \"Liberty\"\nFrom AD 205, when the city (civitas) and community (pagus) fused into one municipality (municipium), Dougga bore the title liberum, whose significance is not immediately clear. The term appears in the titles of a certain number of other municipia also founded at the same time: Thibursicum Bure, Aulodes, and Thysdrus. Several interpretations of its meaning have been suggested. According to Merlin and Poinssot, the term derives from the name of the god Liber, in whose honor a temple was erected at Dougga. The epithet Liberum would thus follow the same pattern as Frugifer and Concordia, which appear in the title of Thibursicum Bure. Thibursicum Bure is however an exception to the rule; the titles of the other municipia including the term liberum do not include the names of any divinities, and this hypothesis has therefore been abandoned. Alternatively, liberum is taken as a reference to free status (libertas, \"liberty\"). This interpretation is confirmed by an inscription found at Dougga that honors Alexander Severus as the \"preserver of liberty\" (conservator libertatis).\nIt is, however, unclear exactly what form this liberty took. Toutain is of the opinion that this is a designation for a particular type of municipium—free cities where the Roman governor did not have the right to control the municipal magistrates. There is however no evidence that Dougga enjoyed exceptional legal privileges of the type associated with certain free cities such as Aphrodisias in Asia Minor. Veyne has thus suggested that Dougga's \"freedom\" is nothing but an expression of the concept of liberty without any legal meaning; obtaining the status of a municipium had freed the city of its subjugation and enabled it to adorn itself with the \"ornaments of liberty\" (ornamenta libertatis). The city's liberty was celebrated just as its dignity was extolled; the emperor Probus is a \"preserver of liberty and dignity\" (conservator libertatis et dignitatis). Gascou, in line with Veyne's interpretation, describes the situation thus: \"Liberum, in Thugga's title, is a term [...] with which the city, which had waited a long time for the status of a municipium, is happy to flatter itself\".\n\nDespite Gascou's conclusion, efforts have been made more recently to identify concrete aspects of Dougga's liberty. Lepelley believes on the one hand that this must be a reference to the relations between the city and Rome and on the other hand that the term can cover a range of diverse privileges of differing degrees. It is known that the territory of Carthage, to which the Dougga pagus belonged until AD 205, enjoyed such privileges: the inhabitants of the pagus even sent an appeal during Trajan's reign to defend the fiscal immunity of the territory of Carthage (immunitas perticae Carthaginiensium). The Dougga civitas had not been granted this concession, so the fusion of pagus with the civitas meant that the citizens of the pagus risked losing their enviable privilege. The liberty of the municipia founded during the reign of Septimius Severus could thus be a reference to the fiscal immunity made possible by the region's great wealth and by the emperor's generosity to each municipium at the time of its fusion. During the reign of Gallienus, a certain Aulus Vitellius Felix Honoratus, a well-known individual in Dougga, made an appeal to the emperor \"in order to assure the public liberty\". Lepelley believes that this is an indication that the city's privilege had been called into question, although Dougga appears to have been at least partially able to preserve its concessions, as evidenced by an inscription to the honor of \"Probus, defender of its liberty\".\nAccording to Christol though, this interpretation overly restricts the meaning of the word libertas. In Christol's view, it is important not to forget that the emperor's decision in 205 must have been taken in response to a request made by the civitas and must have taken account of the relations that already existed between it and the pagus. It was the autonomy that the civitas had achieved during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and the granting of Roman law that raised the specter of a fusion of the two communities, which would without a doubt have provoked a certain unease in the pagus. The inhabitants of the pagus would have expressed \"concern or even refusal when faced with the pretensions of their closest neighbors\". This would explain the honor that the pagus attributed to Commodus (conservator pagi, \"protector of the community\").\nFor Christol, the term liberum must be understood in this context and in an abstract sense. This liberty derives from belonging to a city and expresses the end of the civitas's dependence, \"the elevation of a community of peregrini to the liberty of Roman citizenship\", which also served to placate the fears of the inhabitants of the pagus and to open the door to a later promotion, to the status of a colony. This promotion took place in AD 261, during the reign of Gallienus, following an appeal from Aulus Vitellius Felix Honoratus in Christol's version of events. Thereafter, the defence of the libertas publica was not a question of defending a privilege at risk, but of requesting the \"ultimate liberty\" (summa libertas)—the promotion to the status of a colony. Christol also points out that, despite the abstract character of terms such as libertas or dignitas, their formal appearance should be references to concrete and unique events.\n\nGeneral layout\nThe city as it exists today consists essentially of remains from the Roman era dating for the most part to the 2nd and 3rd century. The Roman builders had to take account both of the site's particularly craggy terrain and of earlier constructions, which led them to abandon the normal layout of Roman settlements, as is also particularly evident in places such as Timgad.\nRecent archaeological digs have confirmed the continuity in the city's urban development. The heart of the city has always been at the top of the hill, where the forum replaced the Numidian agora. As Dougga developed, urban construction occupied the side of the hill, so that the city must have resembled \"a compact mass\", according to Hédi Slim\nEarly archaeological digs concentrated on public buildings, which meant that private buildings tended at first to be uncovered at the ends of the trenches dug for this purpose. Later, trenches were cut with the purpose of exposing particularly characteristic private buildings.\n\nNumidian residence\nTraces of a residence dating to the Numidian era have been identified in the foundations of the temple dedicated to Liber. Although these traces are very faint, they served to disprove the theories of the first archaeologists, including Louis Poinssot, that the Roman and pre-Roman settlements were located on separate sites. The two settlements evidently overlapped.\n\nThe trifolium villa\nThis residence, which dates to the 2nd or 3rd century, stands downhill from the quarters that surround the forum and the principal public monuments in the city, in an area where the streets are winding.\nThe trifolium villa, named after a clover-shaped room that was without a doubt used as a triclinium, is the largest private house excavated so far at Dougga. The house had two storeys, but there is almost nothing left of the upper storey. It stands in the south of the city, halfway up the hill. The house is particularly interesting because of the way in which it is built to align with the lay of the land; the entrance hall slopes down to a courtyard around which the various rooms were arranged.\n\nThe market\nThe market dates from the middle of the 1st century. It took the form of a square 35.5 m × 28 m (116 ft × 92 ft) in size, surrounded by a portico and shops on two sides. The northern side had a portico, while an exedra occupied the southern side. The exedra probably housed a statue of Mercury.\nIn order to compensate for the natural incline of the ground on which the market stands, its builders undertook significant earthworks. These earthworks have been dated as being amongst the oldest Roman constructions, and their orientation vis-à-vis the forum seems to suggest that they were not built on any earlier foundations. The modern-day location of the remains from the market near the forum should however not be misunderstood as indicating a link between the two. The market was almost completely destroyed during the construction of the Byzantine fort. It was excavated in 1918–1919.\n\nLicinian Baths\nThe Licinian Baths are interesting for having much of its original walls intact, as well as a long tunnel used by the slaves working at the baths. The baths were donated to the city by the Licinii family in the 3rd century. They were primarily used as winter baths. The frigidarium  has triple arcades at both ends and large windows with views over the valley beyond.\n\nFunerary structures\nDolmens\nThe presence of dolmens in North Africa has served to stoke historiographic debates that have been said to have ideological agendas. The dolmens at Dougga have been the subject of archaeological digs, which have also uncovered skeletons and ceramic models.\nAlthough it is difficult to put a date on the erection of the dolmens, as they were in use until the dawn of the Christian era, it seems likely that they date from at least 2000 years BC. Gabriel Camps has suggested that a link to Sicily. He has made the same suggestion for the \"haouanet\" tombs found in Algeria and Tunisia.\n\nNumidian bazina tombs\nA type of tomb unique to the Numidian world has been discovered at Dougga. They are referred to as bazina tombs or circular monument tombs.\n\nPunic-Libyan Mausoleum\nThe Mausoleum of Ateban is one of the very rare examples of royal Numidian architecture. There is another in Sabratha in Libya. Some authors believe that there is a link with the funeral architecture in Anatolia and the necropoleis in Alexandria from the 3rd and 2nd century BC.\nThis tomb is 21 m (69 ft) tall and was built in the 2nd century BC. A bilingual inscription installed in the mausoleum mentioned that the tomb was dedicated to Ateban, the son of Iepmatath and Palu. In 1842, Sir Thomas Reade, the British consul in Tunis seriously damaged the monument while removing this inscription. This bilingual Punic-Libyan Inscription, now held at the British Museum, made it possible to decode the Libyan characters. It has only recently been established that the inscription was originally located on one side of a fake window on the podium. According to the most recent research, the names cited in the inscription are only those of its architect and of representatives of the different professions involved in its construction. The monument was built by the inhabitants of the city for a Numidian prince; some authors believe that it was intended for Massinissa\nThe monument owes its current appearance to the work of French archaeologist Louis Poinssot, who essentially reconstructed it from pieces that were left lying on the ground. The tomb is accessed via a pedestal with five steps. On the northern side of the podium (the lowest of three levels in the monument), there is an opening to the funeral chamber that is closed with a stone slab. The other sides are decorated with fake windows and four Aeolic pilasters. The second level is made up of a temple-like colonnade (naiskos); the columns on each side are Ionic. The third level is the most richly decorated of all: in addition to pilasters similar to those on the lowest level, it is capped with a pyramid. Some elements of carved stone have also survived.\n\nRoman sepulchres\nAlthough work has in the past been undertaken to uncover the Roman sepulchres, today they have been reclaimed in part by olive trees.\n\nThe different necropoleis mark the zones of settlement at Dougga. There are five areas that have been identified as necropoleis: the first in the northeast, around the Temple of Saturn and the Victoria Church, the second in the northwest, a zone which also encompasses the dolmens on the site, the third in the west, between the Aïn Mizeb and Aïn El Hammam cisterns and to the north of the Temple of Juno Caelestis, the fourth and the fifth in the south and the south-east, one around the mausoleum and the other around Septimius Severus' triumphal arch.\n\nHypogeum\nThe hypogeum is a half-buried edifice from the 3rd century. It was erected in the middle of the oldest necropolis, which was excavated in 1913. The hypogeum was designed to house funeral urns in small niches in the walls; at the time of its discovery, it contained sarcophagi, which suggests that it was in use for a long time.\n\nPolitical monuments\nTriumphal arches\nDougga still contains two triumphal arches, which are in different states of disrepair.\n\nSeptimius Severus's arch, which is heavily damaged, stands close to the mausoleum and on the route leading from Carthage to Théveste. It was erected in AD 205.\nAlexander Severus' arch, which dates from 222 to 235, is relatively well preserved, despite the loss of its upper elements. It is equidistant from the capitol and the Temple of Juno Caelestis. Its arcade is 4 m (13 ft) tall.\nA third triumphal arch, dating from the Tetrarchy, has been completely lost.\n\nForum\nThe city forum, which is 924 m2 (9,950 sq ft) in size is small. It is better preserved in some places than others, because the construction of the Byzantine fort damaged a large section of it. The capitol, which stands on an area surrounded by porticos, dominates its surroundings by virtue of its imposing appearance. The \"square of the Rose of the Winds\" (which is named after a decorative element) seems more like an esplanade leading to the Temple of Mercury, which stands on its northern side, than an open public space. The city's curia and a tribune for speeches probably also stood here.\nLong ago, archaeologists believed that Roman settlement at Dougga occurred ex nihilo. This suggestion has been contradicted by the discovery of a sanctuary dedicated to Massinissa amongst the substructures to the rear of the capitol.\n\nRecreational facilities\nTheatre\nRoman theatres were a fundamental element of the monumental make-up of a city from the reign of Augustus.\nThe theatre, which was built in AD 168 or 169, is one of the best preserved examples in Roman Africa. It could seat 3500 spectators, even though Dougga only had 5000 inhabitants. It was one of a series of imperial buildings constructed over the course of two centuries at Dougga which deviate from the classic \"blueprints\" only inasmuch as they have been adapted to take account of the local terrain. Some minor adjustments have been made and the local architects had a certain freedom with regard to the ornamentation of the buildings.\n\nA dedication engraved into the pediment of the stage and on the portico the dominates the city, recalls the building's commissioner, P. Marcius Quadratus, who \"built [it] for his homeland with his own denarii\"; the dedication was celebrated with \"scenic representations, distributions of life, a festival and athletic games\".\nThe theater is still used for performances of classic theater, particularly during the festival of Dougga, and conservation work has been carried out on it.\n\nAuditorium\nThe site known as the auditorium is an annex of the Temple of Liber, which probably served for the initiation of novices. Despite its modern appellation, the auditorium was not a site for spectacles; only its form suggests otherwise. It measures 20 m × 20 m (66 ft × 66 ft).\n\nCircus\nThe city has a circus designed for chariot racing, but it is barely visible nowadays. Originally, the circus consisted of nothing more than a field; an inscription in the temple in honor of Caracalla's victory in Germany notes that the land was donated by the Gabinii in 214 and describes it as an ager qui appellatur circus (field that serves as a circus) ). In 225 though, the site was prepared and the circus was constructed. It was financed by the magistrates (duumviri and aedile) after they had promised to do so following in response to a request from the entire population of the city. The circus was built to take the maximum possible advantage of the surrounding landscape, in reflection of an understandable need to limit costs in a medium-sized city with limited resources, but certainly also out of desire to finish the construction works as quickly as possible, given that magistrates' mandates were limited to one year. The construction was nonetheless expected to have \"a certain magnitude\"; at 393 m (1,289 ft) long with a spina 190 m × 6 m (623 ft × 20 ft), the circus is quite extraordinary in Roman Africa. The circus marks Dougga out as one of the most important cities in the province, alongside Carthage, Thysdrus, Leptis Magna, Hadrumet et Utica. The donation of the land for the pleasure of the general populace (ad voluptatem populi) and its development following a request from the entire population (postulante universo populo) are a reminder of the importance of spectacles in the social life of Roman cities and the demand for popular entertainment.\n\nAmphitheater\nThe question of whether there was an amphitheater at Dougga has not been conclusively answered. Traditionally, a large elliptic depression to the northwest of the site has been interpreted as the site of an amphitheater. Archeologists have however become much more cautious on this subject.\n\nBaths\nThree Roman baths have been completely excavated at Dougga; a fourth has so far only been partially uncovered. Of these four baths, one (\"the bath of the house to the west of the Temple of Tellus\") belongs to a private residence, two, the Aïn Doura bath and the bath known for a long time as the \"Licinian bath\", were, judging by their size, open to the public, while the nature of the last bath, the bath of the Cyclopses, is more difficult to interpret.\n\nBath of the Cyclopses\nDuring the excavation of the Bath of the Cyclopses, a mosaic of cyclopses forging Jupiter's thunderbolts was uncovered. It is now on display at the Bardo National Museum, where several very well preserved latrines are also on display. The building has been dated to the 3rd century CE on the basis of a study of the mosaic.\nThe size of the building (its frigidarium is less than 30 m2 (320 sq ft)) has led some experts to believe that it was a private bath, but the identification of a domus in the immediate vicinity has proven difficult. The \"trifolium villa\" is quite distant, and the closest ruins are hard to identify as they have not been well preserved. Yvon Thébert therefore suggests that the bath served the local quarter.\n\nAntonian or Licinian Bath\nThe Antonian Bath, which dates from the 3rd century, was known as the Licinian Baths (after emperor Publius Licinius Egnatius Gallienus) and has several storeys. Louis Poinssot's identification of the bath as dating to Gallienus' reign on the basis of incomplete inscriptions and Dougga's prosperity at this time has been called into question by recent research, conducted in particular by Michel Christol. Christol has suggested that the bath dates from the reign of Caracalla; this thesis has since been confirmed by an analysis of inscriptions. Others have even suggested that the bath dates from the reign of the Severan dynasty, because of a particularity which became common a century later in the west: the columns in the northwest peristyle feature daises bearing arches.\nThe bath was later used for the production of olive oil at an unknown date.\nThe symmetrical building is medium-sized, with an area of 1,700 m2 (18,000 sq ft) excluding the palaestra, of which 175 m2 (1,880 sq ft) are taken up by the frigidarium. The construction of the bath required work both to lower and to raise sections of the slope on which it stood, which may explain why parts of the building have been better preserved than others; the section built on raised ground has for the most part been lost.\n\nAïn Doura Baths\nIn the immediate vicinity of Aïn Doura is a partially excavated complex that could turn out to be the largest bath in the city, the Aïn Doura Baths. On the basis of the mosaics that have been found here, it has been suggested that the bath dates from the end of the 2nd century or the start of the 3rd century, and that the mosaic décor was renewed in the 4th century CE.\nThe complex remains largely unexposed, but it seems, according to Yvon Thébert, that it has a symmetrical design, of which only a section of the cold rooms has been excavated.\n\nThe bath of the house to the west of the Temple of Tellus\nThis bath, measuring 75 m2 (810 sq ft), which can be accessed from the house and from the street, was uncovered at the start of the 20th century. The archaeological analysis of the bath's relationship with the house in which it is located has led Thébert to suggest that it was a later addition to the original construction but he does not propose a date for this event.\n\nReligious edifices\nThere is archaeological or epigraphic evidence for more than twenty temples at Dougga; a significant number for a small city. There are archaeological remains and inscriptions proving the existence of eleven temples, archaeological remains of a further eight, and inscriptions referring to another fourteen. This abundance of religious sites is the result in particular of the philanthropy of wealthy families.\n\nTemple of Massinissa\nThe Temple of Massinissa is located on the western flank of the capital. The first archaeologists believed that the remains of the temple were a monumental fountain, even though an inscription proving the existence of a sanctuary to the deceased Numidian king was discovered in 1904. This inscription has been dated to 139 BC, during the reign of Micipsa.\nThe remains are similar to those of the temple in Chemtou and are evidence of the fact that the political center of the Roman city was in the same place as the Hellenic agora. The stone remains found in this area seem to belong to several different structures; the exact location of the sanctuary is still open to debate.\nAlthough it is believed that the sanctuary set Massinissa on par with a god, this is debated by some experts. Gsell believes that a temple to the king would reflect a continuation of eastern and Hellenic practices; Camps builds on this hypothesis, pointing out the lack of any antique sources testifying to anything more than simple expressions of respect by a people vis-à-vis its king. According to Camps, the temple is only a memorial, a site belonging to a funeral cult. Its construction ten years into Micipsa's reign can be explained by its political symbolism: Micipsa, sole ruler after the death of his brothers Gulussa and Mastanabal, was affirming the unity of his kingdom around the person of the king.\n\nThe Capitol\nThe Capitol is a Roman temple from the 2nd century, principally dedicated to Rome's protective triad: Jupiter Best and Greatest (Jupiter Optimus Maximus), Juno the Queen (Juno Regina), and Minerva the August (Minerva Augusta). It has a secondary dedication to the wellbeing of the emperors Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius; judging by this reference, the Capitol must have been completed in AD 166-167.\nThomas d'Arcos identified the Capitol as a temple of Jupiter in the 17th century. It was the object of further research at the end of the 19th century, led in particular by the doctor Louis Carton in 1893. The walls, executed in opus africanum style, and the entablature of the portico were restored between 1903 and 1910. Claude Poinssot discovered a crypt beneath the cella in 1955. The most recent works were carried out by the Tunisian Institut national du patrimoine between 1994 and 1996.\nThe Capitol is exceptionally well preserved, which is a consequence of its inclusion in the Byzantine fortification. A series of eleven stairs lead up to the front portico. The temple front's Corinthian columns are 8 m (26 ft) tall, on top of which is the perfectly preserved pediment. The pediment bears a depiction of emperor Antoninus Pius's elevation to godhood. The emperor is being carried by an eagle.\nThe base of the cella still features alcoves for three statues. The middle alcove houses a colossal statue of Jupiter.\nThe discovery of the head of a statue of Jupiter has led Poinssot to suggest that the crypt dates from the period of Christianity's triumph over the old religions. St-Amans does not exclude the possibility that the crypt was built at the same time as the Byzantine citadel, of which the forum and capitol formed the nerve center.\nThe construction of the Capitol at Dougga occurred at the same time as the construction of other monuments of the same type elsewhere in North Africa, which Gros explains as a consequence of the greater proximity of the imperial cult and the cult of Jupiter.\nNear the Capitol are the \"square of the Rose of the Winds\"—which is named after a compass rose that is engraved on the floor—and the remains of the Byzantine citadel, which reused a section of the ruins after the city's decline.\n\nTemple of Mercury\nThe Temple of Mercury is also dedicated to Tellus. It faces towards the market; between the two lies the \"square of the Rose of the Winds\". The temple is largely in ruins. It has three cellae but no courtyard. The sanctuary, which can be accessed via a series of four stairs, stands on a faded podium. It was excavated and shored up between 1904 and 1908.\n\nTemple of August Piety\nThe small Temple of August Piety was built during the reign of Hadrian. It was financed through the philanthropy of a certain Caius Pompeius Nahanius. The temple faces the \"square of the Rose of the Winds\". Part of the vestibule survives. Behind the temple, on the foundations of the Temple of Fortuna, Venus Concordia and Mercury, stands a mosque. The mosque is the last remnant of the little village that existed on the site until the creation of New Dougga.\nD'Arcos identified the temple in 1631 thanks to an inscription that was still in place at the time. The podium is relatively low (1–1.5 m or 3 ft 3 in – 4 ft 11 in); it can be ascended by a series of seven stairs on the southern side.\n\nTemple of Minerva\nThe first Temple of Minerva at Dougga was a gift of the patron of the civitas at the end of the 1st century, but the more important site dedicated to this divinity is a building which features a temple and an area surrounded by a portico dating from the reign of Antoninus Pius. It was financed through the philanthropy of a priestess of the imperial cult, Julia Paula Laenatiana. The building was designed to take advantage of the slope on which it stands; the podium is at the level of the roof of the portico and the temple in the strict sense of the word is located outside the surrounding building. The stairs providing access to the temple accentuates the inaccessible nature of the divinity.\n\nTemple of Caracalla's Victory in Germany\nThe Temple of Caracalla's Victory in Germany is the only edifice dedicated to the imperial cult to have been located precisely at Dougga. Fragments of an inscription on the temple's lintel were discovered in 1835, but the temple was not identified until 1966. It features a nymphaeum that dates to the reign of Commodus.\nThe temple, which is relatively narrow, has an unusual design. It is 41.5 m × 14.2 m (136 ft × 47 ft), and is situated beside the road that descends from the forum to the Aïn Doura Bath. The temple is associated with a triumphal arch over the road. The temple can be accessed via a semi-circular staircase; in each corner of the courtyard in front of the staircase is a reservoir for rain water. The cella inside the sanctuary features six lateral niches which are designed to hold the bases of statues of Apollo, Liber, Neptune, Mercury and of two other gods that can no longer be identified.\nThe temple can be seen from afar, but passers-by can only see the cella, the foundations of which are decoratively rusticated. Seven columns are spaced along the cella, linking to the lateral door, which opens onto the staircase. The tetrastyle temple is built in Tuscan order in antis. The temple's design is unusual inasmuch as temples of the imperial cult are generally Corinthian and located in the middle of a vast courtyard with a portico; the Tuscan order was thus quite rare in the provinces.\nThe temple therefore bears witness to a desire to construct something that was different from other such buildings, doubtless in response to the constraints created by the terrain. The dedication in the temple sheds light on its construction: the inscription, which has been very precisely dated to AD 214, consecrates the temple to the personification of victory, Victoria, here specifically in connection with the emperor's campaigns in Germany, for the welfare of Caracalla and of his mother Iulia Domna.\nThe text recalls the military projects of the son of Septimius Severus and their celebration within the context of the imperial cult. This inscription also explains that the temple was constructed at a cost of 100,000 sestertii on the wishes of a great lady of Dougga named Gabinia Hermiona after her death. Besides the generosity of this act of philanthropy, her will foresaw the holding of an annual banquet for the ordo decurionum to be financed by her inheritors on the anniversary of the dedication of the temple. At the same time, Gabinia Hermiona bequeathed the land for the circus \"for the pleasure of the people\".\nThe temple occupied what was doubtlessly one of the last free spaces in the vicinity of the forum. The temple's benefactor preferred this site in the city center to those that she owned in the outskirts: the site of the circus or the site where the Temple of Celeste was later built. Gabinia's family, one of the richest in Dougga, was well placed within Carthage's notables and maintained its power at Dougga, even during the reduction of the local aristocracy in the 3rd century. The terms of Gabinia's will provide evidence of her concern that the family should endure - the annual banquet would keep alive the memory of the family's generosity and emphasize its sociability, while the circus would provide for the pleasure of the most humble of the city's inhabitants.\n\nAt the end of the 4th century, the Temple of Caracalla's Victory in Germany was transformed into a church. The reservoirs in the courtyard were filled in order to provide space for the faithful, while pulpits were added to the cella. The decoration of the cella was also modified.\n\nTemple of Pluto\nPluto receives particular honor at Dougga as the city's patron divinity, as demonstrated by the Genius Thuggae.\nIt is possible that the Temple of Pluto is located near Septimius Severus's triumphal arch in an area of the city that has only been partially excavated as yet, but this hypothesis is not very firm and is based on the discovery of a bust in a courtyard, which has been dated by Poinssot to the 2nd or 3rd century. The associated building was excavated in the 1960s but little is known about the manner in which the excavation was conducted and the stabilization work carried out at the site. A cella with just one niche has been discovered on a podium in the middle of a courtyard and the altar has also been preserved.\nAn architectural study was carried out between 2000 and 2002, but it did not lead to any excavation work.\n\nTemple of Saturn\nSaturn was the successor of the Punic Ba'al Hammon and was the attendant (paredros) of Tanit or Heavenly Juno (Juno Caelestis). During the Roman era, the city of Dougga had at least two sanctuaries dedicated to Saturn. The evidence for the existence of one of the two derives mostly from inscriptions found in the city. The second temple, which is the one commonly known as the Temple of Saturn at Dougga, has been excavated. The remains of this temple, which are less significant than those of the capitol or the Temple of Juno Caelestis, are of particular interest because of their location. The ruins lie atop a promontory that overlooks the rich cereal valley of the Oued Khalled, 160 m (520 ft) from the theater and outside the bounds of the city. During the excavation works, remains of a temple of Ba'al Hammon, particularly ritual ditches (favissae) containing ex-votos, were discovered. The Roman temple thus replaced an indigenous sanctuary that dated back at least to the 2nd century BC. This sanctuary consisted essentially of a wide open space designed to receive ex-votos and sacrifices. It was covered over to facilitate the construction of the Temple of Saturn, the ruins of which can still be seen today.\nThe Roman temple was built during the reign of Septimius Severus. It consists of three cellae, a courtyard with a portico, and a vestibule. Water from the temple roof was collected in cisterns. An inscription provides details about the temple's construction: it was erected using funds bequeathed in the testament of a notable local resident named Lucius Octavius Victor Roscianus at a cost of at least 150,000 sestertii, which seems expensive but may be explained by the extent of the earthworks required to give the temple a solid foundation; these works nonetheless seem to have proven insufficient as work to restore and shore up the edifice appear to have been carried out before it finally fell into ruin.\n\nTemple of Juno Caelestis\nThe Temple of Juno Caelestis, which was built on the outskirts of the city, was described in the 17th century and excavated in the 1890s. Significant restoration work was undertaken between 1904 and 1914, and new studies were carried out between 1999 and 2002.\n\nThe temple is dedicated to Heavenly Juno (Juno Caelestis), the successor of the Punic god Tanit. Its well-preserved temenos is demarcated by a wall, a large section of which has been very well preserved. The court is only partially tiled and has two symmetrical doors. A portico with 25 bays runs along the circular section of the temenos. The portico is topped with a frieze depicting the construction of the temple.\nThe temple in the strict sense of the word stands on a high podium that can be accessed via a series of eleven steps. It is a Corinthian hexastyle peripteros. The pediment features a dedication to Alexander Severus. The cella has been completely lost.\nThe temple, which was erected between AD 222 and 235, was paid for by a certain Q. Gabinius Rufus Felix, who donated inter alia two silver statues of Juno Caelestis that cost 35,000 sestertii.\nThe temenos, which is 52 m (171 ft) in diameter, is reminiscent of a crescent moon, the symbol of Juno Caelestis.\n\nDar Lacheb\nThe purpose of the edifice known as Dar Lacheb (Latin: Domus Lachebia, \"House of Lacheb\") has not been clearly identified. St-Amans believes that it is a sanctuary dedicated to Aesculapius, which accords with Poinssot's hypothesis that it is a temple.\nDar Lacheb was excavated at the end of the 19th century by Carton and has not been the subject of further works since 1912. A house that was built nearby re-using antique remains was destroyed at the start of the 20th century.\nDar Lacheb was built between AD 164 and 166, at the same era as the capitol, which is 50 m (160 ft) away. The entrance to the building has been perfectly preserved, as has one of the columns of the entrance porch. The interior consists of a courtyard that was once surrounded with a portico. To the south is the cella of a temple that has been entirely destroyed.\n\nVictoria Church\nThe Victoria Church, which stands in the northeast of the site, below the Temple of Saturn, is the only Christian building that has been so far excavated at Dougga. At the end of the 4th century or at the start of the 5th century, the Christian community erected the unusually designed little church over a pagan cemetery. The small hypogeum is located nearby.\n\nBishopric\nDuring antiquity, Thugga was also the seat of the bishop of Thucca Terenbenthina. The bishopric was founded during the Roman Empire and survived through the Arian Vandal Kingdom and Orthodox Byzantine Empire, only ceasing to function with the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. The diocese was re-founded by the Roman Catholic Church as a titular see in the 20th century.\n\nInfrastructure\nCisterns and aqueducts\nDougga has two networks of cisterns, in the north and in the west, one of which is particularly well preserved. An aqueduct leading to the city, located a short distance from the well-preserved cisterns, is amongst the best preserved examples of this type of structure on the territory of modern-day Tunisia.\nThe six cisterns of Aïn El Hammam, situated close to the Temple of Juno Caelestis, have a total capacity of 6000 m3 but are in ruins. They were fed by a spring 12 km (7.5 mi) away and an aqueduct constructed during the reign of Commodus and restored in the last quarter of the 4th century CE.\nThis site is still used once annually for a festival celebrating Mokhola, who was a female saint and benefactor of Moroccan origin according to local oral tradition The veneration of Mokhola is accompanied with animal sacrifices. It has been shown that this tradition has pagan origins; the object of veneration was originally the spring, known as fons moccolitanus\nThe second network of cisterns, the cisterns of Aïn Mizeb, is very well preserved. Located close to the Temple of Minerva, these eight domed reservoirs can hold 9,000 m3 (320,000 cu ft) and feature a basin into which they decant. The cisterns are fed by a spring located 200 m (660 ft) away connected via an underground aqueduct.\nA final network of secondary cisterns is located in the vicinity of the Aïn Doura Bath, in the south-west of the site.\n\nStreets\nDougga's streets are not laid out as prescribed by the normal theoretical model of a Roman settlement—around a cardo and a decumanus—as a result of the city's unique design.\nThe center of the city was probably paved; the streets resembled meandering lanes. The city had sewers, as is evidenced by the access stones that are still in place in the streets. At the foot of the hill, there are traces of streets joining with the main road from Carthage to Theveste\n\nDiscoveries made at Dougga\nThe site at Dougga has offered up numerous works or art, many of which have been removed and placed in museums, most notably the Bardo National Museum in Tunis.\n\nWorks on site\nFew works of art have been left on site, with the exception of a sculpture of a togate man (togatus) at the \"Square of the Rose of the Winds\" and a number of mosaics, including those in the building known as the house of Venus and in particular at the Aïn Doura Bath. This is a consequence of the discovery of Dougga's works of art at a time when archaeological sites were robbed of their treasures and abandoned after a dig. This approach has made it possible to preserve a certain number of mosaics with their colours intact; other mosaics that were uncovered but not removed have suffered due to their exposure to the elements.\nA proposal to construct a museum on the site is being studied. It would serve in particular to house recent discoveries and those yet to be made.\n\nWorks at the Bardo National Museum\nStatues\nA number of heads of emperors have been discovered during the digs at the site. Amongst these, the portrait of Lucius Verus is particularly noteworthy: he is depicted with a generous head of hair, a full beard and a vivacity that makes it one of the most significant statues yet discovered in Roman Africa. This African masterpiece was realized in marble from Carrara and still has traces of color amongst the hairs.\nThe Bardo National Museum also houses a togate man (togatus) that dates from the 3rd century. It depicts an aged man, who has a short beard and is dressed in a toga. It seems certain that this is a later work of art reflective of the contemporary taste in art.\n\nMosaics\nThe \"butler's mosaic\" dating from the middle of the 3rd century features a drinking scene. Two characters are serving two others, who are much smaller, from amphoras on their shoulders. The two amphoras bear the letters ΡΙΕ (Rie, \"Drink!\" in Ancient Greek) and ΖΗϹΗϹ (Zēsēs, \"You will live!\"). The amphora bearers are flanked by another two characters, one of whom is carrying another amphora, the other of whom is carrying a branch of laurel and a basket of roses. This depiction is a greeting to all guests and a promise of hospitality. The same is true of another mosaic held at the museum which bears the phrase Omnia tibi felicia (\"May everything please you\").\nThe \"mosaic of the victorious charioteer\" is younger than these works. It dates from the second half of the 4th century, and features the phrase Eros omnia per te (\"All things through you, Eros\"). The depiction of the charioteer shows great attention to realism, as do the depictions of the horses, two of which are named Amandus and Frunitus after their characters. The horses are arranged symmetrically; such symmetries were very popular at the time. The charioteer is holding a whip, a crown made of branches and a palm branch. The starting blocks of the circus can be seen in the background. This work of art was found in a private residence and it appears that it must be interpreted as a monument donated by the owner celebrating the victory of a charioteer named Eros.\nThe \"Ulysses mosaic\" is a work inspired by the Odyssey: the Greek hero Odysseus (Ulysses to the Romans) is seen standing on a boat that is decorated with a human head and a palm branch and that has two sails and a battering ram. Ulysses's hands are tied to the main mast so that he will not succumb to the fatal charm of the sirens' music. Ulysses's companions are seated around him, their ears blocked with wax as described in the legend. Three sirens stand at the base of a rocky crag. They are depicted with the upper body of a woman but the wings and legs of a bird. One of them holds a flute, the second a lyre, while the third, who does not carry an instrument, is believed to be the singing siren. In front of Ulysses's boat, there is a small barque with a fisherman holding a lobster, the depiction of which is over-sized. The mosaic has been dated to around AD 260–268; it was discovered in the \"House of Ulysses and the Pirates\".\nThe mosaic \"Neptune and the pirates\" originates from the same peristyle as the preceding work. It depicts the punishment of pirates on the Tyrrhenian Sea, merging themes linked to Dionysus and more common marine themes. The god is standing, ready to throw his spear. He is supported by a maenad, a satyr and aged Silenus, who is holding the ship's rudder. A leopard is attacking one of the pirates, who are transformed into dolphins as soon as they recognize the divine nature of their adversary. To the left, genii have boarded another ship, while to the right, fishermen are attempting to catch an octopus with a net.\nYacoub attributes a protective function to these two scenes, a means of invoking fate, a practice which is probably based on Hellenic tradition.\nThe mosaic of the \"cyclopses forging Jupiter's thunderbolts\" from the floor of a frigidarium depicts three cyclopses: Brontes, Steropes, and Pyracmon or Arges. They are depicted naked, forging Jupiter's thunderbolts, which Vulcan, seated in front of them, is holding on an anvil. This last element has been lost. The mosaic dates to the end of the 3rd century and was discovered in the \"Bath of the Cyclopses\".\n\nWorks held in other museums\nThe bilingual inscription from the mausoleum taken by the British consul Read is held by the British Museum. The Punic-Libyan Inscription shows the same text in both the Punic and the Berber languages.\n\nSee also\nNumidia\nCarthage\nRoman Africa\nRoman colonies in Berber Africa\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nGhaki, Mansour (2015), \"Toponymie et Onomastique Libyques: L'Apport de l'Écriture Punique/Néopunique\" (PDF), La Lingua nella Vita e la Vita della Lingua: Itinerari e Percorsi degli Studi Berberi, Studi Africanistici: Quaderni di Studi Berberi e Libico-Berberi, Naples: Unior, pp. 65–71, ISBN 978-88-6719-125-3, ISSN 2283-5636, archived from the original (PDF) on 2020-04-28, retrieved 2018-11-03.

          "summary": "Dougga or Thugga or TBGG (Arabic: دقة, romanized: Duqqah; Tunisian Arabic: دڨة, romanized: ) was a Berber, Punic and Roman settlement near present-day Téboursouk in northern Tunisia. The current archaeological site covers 75 hectares (190 acres). UNESCO qualified Dougga as a World Heritage Site in 1997, believing that it represents \"the best-preserved Roman small town in North Africa\". The site, which lies in the middle of the countryside, has been protected from the encroachment of modern urbanization, in contrast, for example, to Carthage, which has been pillaged and rebuilt on numerous occasions. Dougga's size, its well-preserved monuments and its rich Numidian-Berber, Punic, ancient Roman, and Byzantine history make it exceptional. Amongst the most famous monuments at the site are a Libyco-Punic Mausoleum, the Capitol, the Roman theatre, and the temples of Saturn and of Juno Caelestis.",

          "content": "Bulla Regia was a Berber, Punic, and Roman town near present-day Jendouba, Tunisia. Its surviving ruins and archaeological site are noted for their Hadrianic-era semi-subterranean housing, a protection from the fierce heat and effects of the sun. Many of the mosaic floors have been left in place; others may be seen at the Bardo Museum in Tunis. There is also a small museum connected with the site.\n\nNames\nThe Punic name of the town appears on its currency as BBʿL (𐤁𐤁𐤏𐤋‬). This has been suggested to have been a contraction of BT BʿL (𐤁𐤕 𐤁𐤏𐤋‬), meaning \"House\" or \"Temple of Baal\".\nThe name Bulla Regia is Latin for \"Royal Bulla\". The epithet refers to its status as the Numidian capital under Masinissa. It was notionally refounded at the time of its elevation to colony status and formally named Colonia Aelia Hadriana Augusta Bulla Regia after its imperial sponsor Hadrian.\n\nHistory\nBerber town\nA Berber settlement probably predated the Punic one. Imported Greek ceramics dating to the 4th century BC have been found.\n\nPunic town\nCarthage gained control over the town during the 3rd century BC, when inscriptions reveal that the inhabitants venerated Baal Hammon and buried their dead in urns in the Punic style. A capital from a temple of Tanit is preserved at the site's museum.\n\nNumidian capital\nBulla Regia was part of the territory won for Rome by Scipio Africanus in 203 BC during the Second Punic War. The Numidian king Masinissa \"recovered the lands of his ancestors\" (as noted in an inscription) and made Bulla his capital in 156 BC. One of his sons maintained a palace in the city. Under the Numidians, a regularized orthogonal grid street plan was imposed in the hellenistic manner on at least part of the earlier irregular system.\n\nRoman colony\nThe Romans assumed direct control in 46 BC, when Julius Caesar organized the province of Africa and rewarded the (perhaps simply neutral) conduct of Bulla during the recent civil war by making it a free city (Latin: civitas libera). Under Hadrian, it was raised to the status of a Roman colony and its citizens given full citizenship.\n\nDestruction\nBulla Regia slowly lost importance under Byzantine rule. As elsewhere in the late empire, the local aristocracy found themselves in a position to increase the extent of their houses at the expense of public space: the House of the Fisherman was adapted to link two separate insulae, turning a thoroughfare into a dead end. An earthquake destroyed Bulla Regia, collapsing its first floors into the subterranean floors.\n\nRe-discovery\nDrifting sand protected the abandoned sites, which were forgotten until the first excavations were begun in 1906, in part spurred by the destruction of the monumental entrance to the Roman city.\nThe forum, surrounded by porticoes, was excavated 1949–52. Its public basilica had an apse at each end. As a cathedral, it had a highly unusual cruciform baptismal font inserted in the center of the rear (west end) of its nave. Its small amphitheater, the subject of a reproach in a sermon of Augustine of Hippo, retains the crispness of its edges and steps because it lay buried until 1960–61.\n\nMuseum and archeological site\nBulla Regia is now an archeological site. There is a museum, and underground tours are available. Restoration work aims to protect the buildings, which are well-preserved due to being largely built underground. Most of the elaborate polychrome mosaics are being conserved in-situ, allowing visitors to see them in their original architectural context. The Roman drainage system has been restored to keep the houses from flooding.\n\nBuildings\nIn the unique domus architecture developed in the city, a ground-level storey, open to the warming winter sun, stood above a subterranean level, built round a two-story atrium. Open-bottomed terracotta bottle-shapes were built into vaulting. Water sprinkled on the floors brought the colors of the mosaics to life while they provided cooling by evaporation.\nIn the House of the Hunt, the basilica, with an apse at its head, a transept and dependent spaces opening into what would be the nave if it were a church, has been instanced (Thébert) as an example of the conjunction between public architecture and the domus of the ruling class in the fourth century, spaces soon to be Christianized as churches and cathedrals.\nThe subtle colors and shading and the modelling of three-dimensional forms of the finest mosaics at Bulla Regia are not surpassed by any in North Africa, where the Roman art of mosaic floors reached its fullest development. The mosaic of a haloed Amphitrite (House of Amphitrite) is often illustrated (see image above).\nA temple complex at Bulla Regia dates to the time of Emperor Septimius Severus and features intricate mosaic floors, opus sectile decorations, and paintings. An inscription confirms that the emperor and his sons, Geta and Caracalla, were venerated at the site.\nA Temple of Apollo has also been identified at the site. In its courtyard, abandonment deposits over the paved surface yielded the remains of a woman who had worn a slave collar made out of lead. The tag states that the wearer had fled from Bulla Regia and instructs the finder to detain her; it includes the words \"Adultera meretrix,\" taken by scholars either as a slave name or as an insulting descriptor (which scholar Jennifer Trimble notes would amount to something like \"a slutty prostitute\").\n\nReligion\nBulla Regia was important enough to become a bishopric, suffragan of Carthage, which transformed the civil basilica into its cathedral. Bulla Regia  was the seat of an ancient bishopric bearing its name. The bishopric was founded during the Roman Empire and survived through the Arian Vandal Kingdom and Orthodox Byzantine Empire, only declined with the city and the arrival of Islam.\nThe diocese was refounded in the 20th century as Bullensium Regiorum, a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church. Its bishops have included:\n\nJules Girard (8 July 1921 – 23 March 1950)\nHerbert Bednorz (4 May 1950 – 12 November 1967)\nTitular Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục (17 February 1968 – 13 December 1984), retired Metropolitan Archbishop of Huê\nAdam Marcinkowski (23 February 1985 on), Auxiliary Bishop of Płock\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nGarcía Moreno, Luis A.

          "content": "Kerkouane or Kerkuane (Arabic: كركوان, Karkwān) is the site of an ancient Punic city in north-eastern Tunisia, near Cape Bon. Kerkouane was one of the most important Punic cities, with Carthage, Hadrumetum (modern Sousse), and Utica. This Phoenician city was probably abandoned during the First Punic War (c. 250 BC) and was not rebuilt by the Romans. It had existed for almost 400 years.\nUNESCO declared the Punic town of Kerkouane and its necropolis a World Heritage Site in 1985, citing among other things that the remains constitute the only example of a Phoenicio-Punic city to have survived.\nThe name Kerkouane was given to the town by archaeologists. Its name in antiquity has not been preserved in any known historical documents.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Kerkouane is a Libyco-Berber toponym deriving from Berber kkerker \"to wall up\", it is also found in Algeria and the Sahel region.\n\nExcavations\nKerkouane is a small town and was probably never home to more than 1,200 people, mostly fishermen and craftsmen. Based on the presence of many murex shells, it would appear that the town produced purple dye, in addition to salt and garum (a food product).\nExcavations of the town have revealed ruins and coins from the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. Around the site where the layout is clearly visible, many houses still show their walls, and the coloured clay on the facades is often still visible. The town was built on a grid with wide streets and public squares. The houses were built to a standard plan, in accordance with a sophisticated notion of town planning.\nTraces of red ochre found in excavated tombs are common also to native Libyan burial customs, but the religious and architectural traditions of the town are predominantly of Carthaginian style. A black-figure wine jug decorated with a scene from The Odyssey found with an Ionian cup, and Greek architectural elements like peristyle courtyards and stucco plaster decorations found among the remains of upscale private homes, show the town was influenced by the culture of the greater Mediterranean world.\nA sanctuary has some columns preserved, and in a small atrium parts of mosaics are found. Curbstones, doorsteps, thresholds, and floors of simple mosaic layers are found all over the ruins.\nThere is an area for ritual banquets and a sacrificial altar. While archaeologists are unsure precisely which deities the temple was dedicated to, they speculate based on artifacts found at the site that it may have been Melqart, Sid and Tanit. Terracotta heads showing two males wearing conical hats resemble Sid and Melqart iconography known from the Temple of Antas in Sardinia.\n\nClimate change\nDue to its coastal location, Kerkouane is vulnerable to sea level rise. In 2022, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report included it in the list of African cultural sites which would be threatened by flooding and coastal erosion by the end of the century, but only if climate change followed RCP 8.5, which is the scenario of high and continually increasing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the warming of over 4 °C., and is no longer considered very likely. The other, more plausible scenarios result in lower warming levels and consequently lower sea level rise: yet, sea levels would continue to increase for about 10,000 years under all of them. Even if the warming is limited to 1.5 °C, global sea level rise is still expected to exceed 2–3 m (7–10 ft) after 2000 years (and higher warming levels will see larger increases by then), consequently exceeding 2100 levels of sea level rise under RCP 8.5 (~0.75 m (2 ft) with a range of 0.5–1 m (2–3 ft)) well before the year 4000. Thus, it is a matter of time before Kerkouane is threatened by rising water levels, unless it can be protected by adaptation efforts such as sea walls.\n\nSee also\nSanctuary of Thinissut\n\nReferences\nGallery\nExternal links\n Media related to Kerkouane at Wikimedia Commons\nLexicorient Archived 2011-11-13 at the Wayback Machine\nKerkounane Guide",

          "content": "Sousse,  Sūsah , or Soussa (Arabic: سوسة, IPA: [ˈsuːsa] ), is a city in Tunisia, capital of the Sousse Governorate. Located 140 km (87 mi) south of the capital Tunis, the city has 271,428 inhabitants (2014). Sousse is in the central-east of the country, on the Gulf of Hammamet, which is a part of the Mediterranean Sea. Its economy is based on transport equipment, processed food, olive oil, textiles, and tourism. It is home to the Université de Sousse.\n\nToponymy\nSousse and Soussa are both French spellings of the Arabic name Sūsa. The present city has also grown to include the ruins of Hadrumetum, which had many names in several languages during antiquity.\n\nGeography\nSousse is in eastern Tunisia, on the Tunisian Sahel coast bordering the Mediterranean Sea. The city covers 45 km2 and is 25 meters above sea level.\nSousse is between two wadis: the Wadi Bliban (and its tributary the Wadi al-Kharrub) to the north and northwest and the Wadi al-Halluf to the southeast. The subsoil is mostly sedimentary with some deep alluvial deposits, which are more recent closer to the coast. Winters are generally mild, there is an average of 69 days of rainfall per year, and there is a lot of sunshine year-round with relatively few cloudy days.\n\nAdministration\nThe Municipality of Sousse is the capital of a governorate that extends over 2669 km2. It is divided into four municipal districts: Sousse Nord, Sousse Sud, Sousse Médina and Sousse Riadh. The first two were created on 11 February 1976 and the last two on 19 February 1982. Its main constituencies and Delegation are four in number: Sousse Sidi Abdelhamid, Sousse Médina, Sousse Jawhara and Sousse Riadh. Its geographic code is 31.\n\nHistory\nHadrumetum\nIn the 11th century BC, Tyrians established Hadrumetum as a trading post and waypoint along their trade routes to Italy and the Strait of Gibraltar. Its establishment (at a river mouth about 9.7 km or 6 mi north of old Sousse) preceded Carthage's but, like other western Phoenician colonies, it became part of the Carthaginian Empire following Nebuchadnezzar II's long siege of Tyre in the 580s and 570s BC.\nThe city featured in the Third Sicilian War, the Second and Third Punic Wars (in the latter of which it secured additional territory and special privileges by aiding Rome against what was left of the Carthaginians), and Caesar's Civil War, when it was the scene of Caesar's famously deft recovery: upon tripping while coming ashore, he dealt with the poor omen this threatened to become by grabbing handfuls of dirt and proclaiming \"I have you now, Africa!\" (Latin: Teneo te Africa!) The second city in Roman Africa after Carthage, it became the capital of the province of Byzacena during the Diocletianic Reforms. Its native sons included the jurist Salvius Julianus, the emperor Clodius Albinus, and numerous Christian saints. The Roman and Byzantine catacombs beneath the city are extensive: they were mainly investigated in 1913-1927 by French missionaries and soldiers.\nThe Vandals sacked Hadrumetum in 434 but it remained a place of importance within their kingdom; a bishop and proconsul were martyred there during the Vandals' periodic forced conversions of their subjects to Arianism. The Byzantine Empire reconquered the town in 534 during the Vandal War and engaged in a public works program that included new fortifications and churches. The town was sacked during the Umayyad Caliphate's 7th-century conquest of North Africa. According to a 1987 ICOMOS report, Uqba ibn Nafi's siege and capture of the city resulted in its almost complete destruction, such that no monument of Hadrumetum \"subsists in situ\".\n\nMedieval Susa\nMuslim Arab armies rapidly spread Arab culture across what had been a thoroughly Romanized and Christianized landscape. Under the Aghlabids, Susa was established near the ruins of Hadrumetum and served as their main port. Their 827 invasion of Sicily was mainly launched from the town's harbor. After the Byzantine city of Melite (modern Mdina on Malta) was captured by the Aghlabids in 870, marble from its churches was used to build the Ribat. A soaring structure that combined the purposes of a minaret and a watch tower, it remains in outstanding condition and draws visitors from around the world. Its mosque is sometimes accounted the oldest surviving in the region and the town's main mosque, also built during the 9th century, has a similarly fortress-like appearance.\nSusa was briefly occupied by Norman Sicily in the 12th century; it fell to the Ottoman Empire in the 16th; and it was bombarded by a French and Venetian fleet in the 18th.\nMedieval Susa was known for its textile industries, producing silk and flax fabrics called Sūsī. Especially renowned were its robes called shuqqas, some of which were mass-produced and sold ready-to-wear throughout the Mediterranean.\nAfter the decline of Mahdia in the 15th and 16th centuries, Susa remained as the most important town in the Sahel region, with a population of about 15,000.\n\nColonial Sousse\nTunisia became a French protectorate in 1881. Around the end of the 19th century, Sousse had a population of 7,000 and was the second-most-important city in Tunisia after Tunis itself. At this point, the entire population of Sousse lived in the walled medina. The medina was surrounded by agricultural settlements, two of which - Kala Kebira and Msaken - were more densely populated than the city itself. The French Protectorate reinforced Sousse's role as a commercial and administrative center by establishing public buildings, enlarging the city's port, and building railways. Between 1896 and 1911, railways were built connecting Sousse with Tunis, Kairouan, Sfax, Mahdia, Moknin, and Henshir Suwatir. Food industries were also established in the city.\nBefore the First World War, Sousse had about 25,000 inhabitants, including around 10,000 French and roughly 5,000 other Europeans, mostly Italians and Maltese. The port was the garrison of the 4th Tunisian Rifle Regiment.\nThe first developments outside the medina walls were begun during this period, but they were home to a relatively small number of people until after the Second World War. Sousse was devastated by the war and suffered 39 bombardments between December 1942 and May 1943. In 1946, after the war was over, the authorities decided to give a high priority to reconstruction efforts in Sousse.\n\nModern Sousse\nWhen Tunisia became independent in 1956, Sousse was made a wileya capital and it continued to expand in all directions. Over the course of the 20th century, its growth was explosive: from just 8,577 residents in 1885, it had grown to 134,835 residents in 1994. Its physical area had also increased massively, from a compact 29 hectares in 1881 to 3,100 hectares in 1992. The secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy also grew accordingly.\nSousse has retained the Arabian look and feel it assumed in the centuries after its initial conquest. Today it is considered one of the best examples of seaward-facing fortifications built by the Arabs. With a population of about 200,000, Sousse retains a medieval heart of narrow, twisted streets, a kasbah and medina, its ribat fortress and long wall on the Mediterranean. Surrounding it is a modern city of long, straight roads and more widely spaced buildings.\nSousse was the site of the chess interzonal in 1967, made famous when American Grandmaster Bobby Fischer withdrew from the tournament even though he was in first place at the time.\nOn 26 June 2015, a lone gunman, Seifeddine Rezgui Yacoubi, opened fire on tourists sunbathing on a beach near the Riu Imperial Marhaba and Soviva hotels, killing 38 and wounding 39, before being shot dead by the police.\n\nCityscape\nDemography\nAs of 2019, Sousse's population was 737,027. Males represent 50.1% of the population structure (with a population of 509,456) against 49.9% by females (with a population of 507,426) in 2014.\n\nPublic services\nThe city contains the University of Sousse, formerly known as the University of the Center, including its Ibn El Jazzar, Faculty of Medicine, the Sousse National School of Engineers, and the Higher Institute of Music of Sousse, founded in 1999.\nThere are a number of high schools, such as the pilot high school of Sousse, the boys' high school, the Tahar-Sfar high school (formerly the young girls' high school), the 20 – March 1934 high school (technical high school), the Abdelaziz-El-Bahi high school or the Jawhara high school, and colleges, such as the Pilot College of Sousse, the Mohamed El Aroui College and the Constantine College.\nSousse is served by a hospital, the Hospital of Sahloul, the largest in the region.\n\nEconomy\nSousse's most important economic activity takes place in the tertiary sector, which employs over 50% of the city's workforce and includes administration, education, healthcare, trade, communications, and banking. Not far behind is the secondary sector, which employs another 45% of the city's workers and includes industries like textiles and leather, construction, chemicals, electronics, and mechanical and electrical components. The small remainder is engaged in the primary sector, mainly fishing. Although smaller than the port in Sfax, Sousse has a port that serves an important commercial outlet for central Tunisia, particularly for the regions around Kairouan and Kasserine.\nSousse is the third largest city in Tunisia after Tunis and Sfax. Although it is associated with olive oil manufacture and has other industries, tourism predominates today. An olive grove covering more than 2,500 km2 (965 sq mi) constitutes one of its main riches since antiquity. The busy port near downtown adds a touch of liveliness to its activity. Sousse also had many oil wells in the area during its colonial period.\n\nTourism\nSousse is an important tourist resort. It has a hot semi-arid climate, with the seaside location moderating the climate, making it an all-season resort with hot, dry summers and warm, mild, wet winters. The fine sandy beaches are backed by orchards and olive groves.\nOnly 20 km (12 mi) from Monastir and Monastir Habib Bourguiba International Airport, hotel complexes with a capacity of 40,000 beds extend 20 km (12 mi) from the old city (medina) north along the seafront to Port El Kantaoui. Some 1,200,000 visitors come every year to enjoy its hotels and restaurants, nightclubs, casinos, beaches, and sports facilities.\nSousse is considered a popular tourist destination, especially due to its nightlife. The season traditionally begins at the start of June and finishes on the first weekend of October with the closing parties.\n\nTransport\nSousse is well-connected with the main Tunisian Railways network, having non-electrified lines to Tunis (since 1899), Sfax (since 1911), and Kasserine (since 2004) with diesel multiple unit and locomotive-driven trains. The main Gare Sousse terminus is in the city center, while Gare Kalaa Seghira serves a bypass route.\nSince 2010 the electrified Sahel Metro line goes south to Monastir Habib Bourguiba International Airport, Monastir, and Mahdia. This line has the Sousse - Bab Jadid station as its northern terminus in Sousse's city center, and 4 additional stations in the city.\nIntercity buses and red-strip microbuses (so-called louages) connect Sousse with many cities in Tunisia. Urban transit in Sousse is served by routes of articulated and conventional buses, blue-strip louages, and cheap taxis. The 600 mm (1 ft 11+5⁄8 in) Sousse–Kairouan Decauville railway operated from 1882 to 1996, before it was regauged to 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) gauge.\n\nSights\nMedina\nA medina, surrounded by its city walls and fortifications, is of historical interest. The medina includes open and covered bazaars (souks). Buildings of historical interest include the ribat castle, the central mosque, and a historical museum in the Casbah with mosaics from the area's many Roman villas. The Carthaginian catacombs can be visited.\nUNESCO declared the medina of Sousse a World Heritage Site in 1988, citing among various things its preservation from modern development.\n\nPort Kantaoui\nThe Kantaoui Port, is a touristic station in the form of a Port. It was built in 1979 specifically as a tourist center.\nThe architecture, although modern and dazzlingly white, has been modeled on the more traditional buildings in Tunisia, complete with narrow streets and arches. The hotels that line the beachfront extend from Sousse itself along miles of sparkling clean sea to the harbor of Port El Kantaoui and to the north of the harbor.\n\nReligious buildings\nGreat Mosque\nLocated at the entrance to the medina, it was erected by the Aghlabid sovereign Aboul Abbas I (841–856) in 850–851, almost thirty years after the construction of the Ribat of Sousse. This mosque is the most emblematic of a city that became a few years after the reign of Ziadet-Allah I (817–838), the second city of Ifriqiya and the Sahel. Subsequently, the building is enlarged during the reign of Ibrahim II (875–902).\n\nOther religious sights\nBou Ftetah Mosque\nMédersa El Zaqqaq\nÉglise Saint-Félix\n\nSport\nSousse is represented by Étoile Sportive du Sahel, a large multisport club. Football is the city's most popular sport, and ES Sahel has won the Tunisian football championship eleven times and the Tunisian Cup ten times. The team's home ground is Stade Olympique de Sousse. Handball, basketball, and volleyball are also popular.\n\nClimate\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies Sousse's climate as hot semi-arid (BSh) bordering with hot-summer Mediterranean (Csa) and cool semi-arid (BSk).\nThe highest recorded temperature was 48 °C (118 °F) on 28 August 2007, while the lowest recorded temperature was 4.5 °C (40.1 °F) on 27 December 1993.\n\nNotable people\nOns Jabeur, professional tennis player\nSalvius Julianus or Julian the Jurist, a master jurist, public official, and politician who served in the Roman imperial state under four successive emperors.\nPrimasius of Hadrumetum, Roman bishop and exegete, noted for his Commentary on the Apocalypse\nMohamed Ghannouchi, former prime minister\nHamadi Jebali, former prime minister\nAymen Abdennour, footballer\nMakrem Ben Romdhane, basketball player\nDov Alfon, author and journalist\nMarcel Dadi, guitarist who died in the TWA accident of 1996.\nZine El Abidine Ben Ali former President\nSleim Ammar, neuropsychiatrist and poet.\nRihab Chaieb, opera singer, mezzosopran\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nSousse is twinned with:\n\nGallery\nReferences\nFurther reading\nA New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology, and Geography, New York: Harper & Bros, 1860.\nBabelon, Ernest Charles François (1911). \"Hadrumetum\" .

A number of Punic steles were discovered in the Medina, between the Ribat and the Great Mosque, in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nHistory\nThe Medina of Sousse is located in the Tunisian Sahel and forms an outstanding archeological site. This was primarily because of the time it was built at the dawn of Islamic civilization, making it one of the earliest constructions after the Islamic conquests in the Maghreb. It was also because of the location of the Medina, a site that required protection against piracy and plunder.\nThe constructions comprised in its precincts witnessed the early post-conquest civilisations. Its architectural style, from the time of the Aghlabid, is representative of the military coastal constructions of the era, meant to be stout and imposing, so as to ward off foes.\n\nClimate change\nAs a coastal heritage site, Medina of Sousse is vulnerable to sea level rise. In 2022, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report included it in the list of African cultural sites which would be threatened by flooding and coastal erosion by the end of the century, but only if climate change followed RCP 8.5, which is the scenario of high and continually increasing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the warming of over 4 °C., and is no longer considered very likely. The other, more plausible scenarios result in lower warming levels and consequently lower sea level rise: yet, sea levels would continue to increase for about 10,000 years under all of them. Even if the warming is limited to 1.5 °C, global sea level rise is still expected to exceed 2–3 m (7–10 ft) after 2000 years (and higher warming levels will see larger increases by then), consequently exceeding 2100 levels of sea level rise under RCP 8.5 (~0.75 m (2 ft) with a range of 0.5–1 m (2–3 ft)) well before the year 4000. This means that unless effective adaptation efforts such as sea walls can be constructed to deal with the sea level rise, damage and the potential destruction of Medina of Sousse is a matter of time.\n\nSee Also\nZawiya of Sidi Bouraoui",

          "content": "Ribat of Sousse (Arabic: رباط سوسة) is a ribat in the city of Sousse, Tunisia. Although scholars differ on the chronology of its original construction, it was most likely founded in the 8th century and reconstructed or completed in its current form during the early 9th century, under the Aghlabid dynasty. Although a large number of ribats were built in the region during that period, the Ribat of Sousse is by far the best-preserved.\n\nHistory\nThe Ribat of Sousse was founded during the 8th century, or late 8th century, during the tenure of the Abbasid governor Yazid ibn Hatim al-Muhallabi (d. 787). There is also evidence that the site of the ribat was formerly occupied in Classical antiquity, reflecting the fact that many ribats in Tunisia were built over the remains of more ancient fortifications.\n\nIn the year 800 the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid granted the governorship of Ifriqiya (roughly modern-day Tunisia) to Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab, who founded the Aghlabid dynasty that ruled the region for the next century, nominally on behalf of the Abbasids. This was period in which the construction of ribats proliferated, and they were constructed at regular intervals along Ifriqiya's coastline, permitting signals to be sent rapidly between them. An inscription carved on a marble plaque over the doorway of the ribat's cylindrical tower records the name of the Aghlabid emir Ziyadat Allah I and the year 821. It also names Masrur al-Khadim, a freed slave and Ziyadat Allah's mawla, as responsible for the construction. This is the oldest surviving Islamic-era monumental inscription in Tunisia. The full Arabic inscription and its translation reads:\n\nIn the name of God, the Kind, the Merciful. God’s Blessing. This is what the Emir Ziyādat Allāh ibn Ibrāhīm has ordered, may God prolong his life!... by the hands of Masrūr al-Khūdim [the servant], his emancipated slave, in the year 206 [821 AD]. O God, lead us down into a blessed home. You are the best of leaders.\nSome scholars have interpreted the date in this inscription as the year of the ribat's original foundation. Other scholars, such as Alexandre Lézine and Jonathan Bloom, interpret this date as the year when the tower was added to the existing ribat. Georges Marçais cited the year 821 as the date of the tower's construction and the completion of the ribat in its current form. Mourad Rammah states that the ribat was almost certainly founded in the 8th century but was completely reconstructed by Ziyadat Allah I in 821. Scholar Sibylle Mazot states that soil analysis has demonstrated that the ribat's foundation is indeed older than 821 and dates back to the 8th century, so that the year 821 signifies the date of a reconstruction. \nDuring the restoration, two floors, a basement, and battlements were added, as well as thirty rooms for guards to live complete with bathroom and toilet. A mosque was also established on the terrace and used by the citizens of Sousse especially during the Eid al-Fitr or Eid al-Adha. It is considered the first mosque built in the city, older even than the Bou Ftata Mosque and the Great Mosque of Sousse. The ribat is also equipped with a water basin that collects rainwater for the use of drinking and washing. The basin was first built by Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab and was expanded later by Ziyadat Allah. After the Byzantine city of Melite (modern Mdina on Malta) was captured by the Aghlabids in 870, marble and columns plundered from its churches was used to build the Ribat.\nThe north and east wings of the ribat's interior were rebuilt or restored in 1722. Other than this, the building has mostly retained its original aspect. In 1988 it was inscribed, along with the Medina of Sousse, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nArchitecture\nThe ribat is built of stone and consists of a square walled enclosure measuring around 38 meters long and 11 meters high. Its plan resembles the original form of the Ribat of Monastir founded in 796 by Harthama ibn A'yan. Round towers reinforce its corners and the middle of its of its four sides, except for the southeastern corner, where a square tower serves as the base for a tall cylindrical tower on top of it, and the middle south side, where a projecting rectangular salient serves as the entrance gate. The gate entrance is framed by reused ancient columns. Inside the gate are narrow openings for a former portcullis and for defenders to drop projectiles or boiling oil on attackers. The vestibule of the gate is covered by a groin vault and flanked by guardrooms.The gate leads to the rectangular courtyard which is flanked by arcades on four sides, behind which are lines of small rooms and an upper floor. There are 33 narrow rooms in total on the ground floor. Most of the rooms and galleries are covered by barrel vaults made of rubble stone, except for those of the north and east sides (rebuilt in the 18th century) which contain groin vaults. Stairs lead to the upper floor, which is lined by more rooms on three sides. The south side is occupied by a long vaulted hall with a mihrab (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer), which is the oldest preserved mosque or prayer hall in North Africa. The room is divided into two aisles by a row of cross-shaped pillars supporting a vaulted ceiling. It had a capacity of about 200 worshipers.Another set of stairs leads to the roof and the top of the walls, which are crowned with crenellations on both their inner and outer edges. Another small room in the fortress, located above the gate at the top of the walls, contains another mihrab and is covered by a dome supported on squinches. This is the oldest example of a dome with squinches in Islamic North Africa. The cylindrical tower above the southeast corner was most likely intended as a lighthouse. It can be ascended via a spiral staircase inside. It has a marble inscription plaque over its entrance (mentioned above).",

Renowned for being the most southerly of the Tunisian oases and one of the gates of the Tunisian Sahara desert, the oasis is fed by a hot source water in which one can bathe and with alleged thermal virtues. Ksar Ghilane has long been difficult to reach but is now connected by an asphalt road to Douz (80 kilometers to the north) or Matmata: it can be now accessed by all-terrain vehicles or private or rental cars.\n\nEconomy\nKsar Ghilane hosts some fifty now sedentarized formerly nomadic families living from date palm agriculture, the raising of goats and sheep and an increasingly important tourist activity. For tourism, several activities are on offer: ATV quad biking, motorcycling, horseback riding or camel trekking on dromedaries. Tourists can enjoy the sandy landscapes while basking in the relative freshness of the oasis and the comfort of swimming in a hot spring (as nights in the desert can get cooler).\nThere are three campsites with Berber tents and a luxury hotel with about 60 air-conditioned tents, a guest house and a ranch with private rooms for overnight stays. In addition to those in the 3 campsites, some cafes and a restaurant are located around the hot spring.\n\nHistory\nAs its name suggests (ksar means \"castle\" in Arabic), the oasis contains fortifications:\nLess than a kilometer away from the palm trees stand the ruins of the Roman castellum named Tisavar. Build at the latest under emperor Commodus (180‑192 CE), it  was a border post on the Western portion of the limes tripolitanus, i.e. the Southern limes, or border of the Roman empire which, in Tunisia, follows the edge of the Sahara desert. Though partially covered by sand drift, three structures built on a hill remain visible today: The fortress with a small portion of its rampart walkway next to the entry gate still standing, and in its South-West a rectangular building of ca 12x8.5 meters. Opposite the fortress' gate is another building with rooms looking like small cells gathered in a rectangular shape with rounded angles around a rectangular central courtyard: those small rooms were the living quarters of the Legio III Augusta from the Roman Army of Africa and in the center of the courtyard, a temple dedicated to Jupiter has been found. A bit lower on the dune a trefoiled-shaped small construction has been excavated and shown to function as a chapel (a votive writing dedicating it to the local genie of Tisavar was found in it)\nThe Tunisian government requested (on Feb 17th, 2012) for the Tisavar Roman ruins for be included in a future classification on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\nIn 1906, large deposits of phosphates and iron were found in the area prompting the construction of a railway track to connect the mining area to the rest of the network.\n\nDuring World War II the town was involved in the battle of Tunisia. One kilometer to the East of this battle site stands a commemorative stele, locally known under the General Leclerc's column name. It celebrates the presence of the French army in 1943, during the battle of Ksar Ghilane. The stela's writing reads:\n\"Here, from February 23rd to March 10th 1943, General Leclerc and Force L, coming from Chad, successfully supported the assault of the enemy forces, inflicting severe losses on them.\"\nIn 2001, the television show The Amazing Race 1 went through the town, and in 2011 the Saharun road race went through the town.\nIn 2010, a Martian (Shergottite) meteorite fell close to the oasis. It was analyzed and approved as an official meteorite under the Ksar Ghilaine 002 name. It is the 100th meteorite of Martian origin ever collected on earth.",

The lake and wetlands of Ichkeul National Park are an important stopping-over point for hundreds of thousands of migrating birds each year. Among the lake's visitors are ducks, geese, storks, and pink flamingoes. Dam construction on the lake's feeder rivers has produced major changes to the ecological balance of the lake and wetlands.\n\nHistory\nIn the reign of the Hafsid dynasty, Lake Ichkuel was a reserve during the 13th century. It later became the property of the public domain in the early 20th century during French rule. Since 1980, it has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nBecause dams have sharply reduced the freshwater inflow to the lakes and marshes, the reedbeds, sedges, and other fresh-water plant species have been replaced with salt-loving plants. These changes have produced a sharp reduction in the migratory bird populations, which depend on the mix of plants that used to exist.\nAccording to the UNESCO Website, the Tunisian government has undertaken some steps to retain freshwater and reduce salinity, and the lake was removed from UNESCO's list of World heritage in danger in 2006.\nHowever some reports from the World Conservation Union suggest that the salinity has already become excessively high and the possibility for rehabilitation may be rapidly disappearing.\n\nIchkeul National Park\nIchkeul National Park is a World Heritage Site located in the north of Tunisia, 25 km southwest of Bizerte and 15 km north of Mateur.

          "content": "The Zaghouan Aqueduct or Aqueduct of Carthage is an ancient Roman aqueduct, which supplied the city of Carthage, Tunisia with water. From its source in Zaghouan it flows a total of 132 km, making it among the longest aqueducts in the Roman Empire.\nSome of its length (40 ha area) is also classified as an Important Bird Area (TN013) as the cavities and holes in the aqueduct are used as nesting and roosting sites by falcons and other species.\n\nDate\nThe date of the construction of the aqueduct is not entirely clear. Sources mention a visit by the Emperor Hadrian in 128, with which a five-year-long drought is meant to have come to an end. The water shortage resulting from the drought might have convinced him that the people should not rely only on rainwater anymore. A second event that might have inspired it was the opening of the Baths of Antonius in Carthage in 162. These facilities on the same scale as the Imperial baths in Rome demanded a steady supply of water, which could not be fulfilled with rainwater.\n\nSources\nThe aqueduct draws on several sources which ran dry at different times. The first and most important source is located near the town of Zaghouan in the Djebel Zaghouan, a mountain range about 60 km south of Carthage. In Roman times a sacred fountain structure was built over the spring, which became one of the most important in ancient North Africa.\n\nDescription\nThe sacred fountain is located on an artificial terrace. It is open on the north side, and on the southern side there is an open space enclosed by a 4-metre-wide (13 ft), crescent-shaped portico. In the center of the portico is a cella from which the spring sprang.\nThe outer wall had a core of Roman concrete covered with coarse limestone bossages. This wall continued from the ends of the crescent-shaped portico and was divided into 26 sections be engaged columns. In every second section, there is a niche for statues, which do not survive. Opposite each engaged column is a full column, which together once supported a vaulted peristyle. The vaults are made of porous travertine covered in marble, while the columns are sandstone. The exterior of the vault was sealed with waterproof Opus signinum and left without further protection. The floor of the portico was decorated with mosaic. The cella, the most important part of the building was built from limestone and clad in marble.\n\nIntake\nThere were five springs in the area of the sacred fountain. These were in the area of the artificial terrace in their original, underground bed and gathered in a basin under the terrace. From this basin, the water then flowed into the pipe of the aqueduct. As well as feeding the aqueduct intake, the basin also served to clean the water - while the water sat in the basin, impurities would settle on the bottom.\n\nSecond source\nIn Severan times, a second source was attached to the aqueduct. This was located in the region of Djouggar. A sacred fountain was built over this spring too, but it never reached the significance of the one at Zaghouan.\n\nWater channel\nTechnical data\nThe aqueduct is a masterpiece of Roman engineering. In the journey from Zaghouan to Carthage, it travels a little over 90 km and drops only 264 m in height, which is an average decline of 0.3%. However, 130 m of the height difference occurs in the first 6 km from Zaghouan to Moghrane. For the rest of the journey to Carthage, the decline averages only 0.15%. In Moghrane the aqueduct met the later channel coming from Djouggar, another 33 km away. Including all its tributary channels, the aqueduct has a length of 132 km and is among the longest in the Roman empire.\nThe channel discharged between 200 and 370 L of water per second or between 17 and 32 million liters per day. The flow rate was around 3.5 and 5.5 km per hour. Therefore, the water made the journey from Zaghouan to Carthage in between a day and a half, to two days.\n\nCourse\nThe channel was built such that it had a steady, if not uniform, fall so that the water would travel the route by the force of gravity alone. In order to minimize the building work, the channel was laid on or a little under the Earth's surface where possible. In order to avoid unnecessary loss of height, the channel follows the contours of hills. In three places it was not possible for the channel to remain at ground level, so the engineers erected imposing arcades. They are:\n\nThe plain of Oudna: 5 km, including a 125-metre-long (410 ft) bridge on a double arcade with a height of 33 m. This bridge was demolished in 1859 in order to reuse the stone for the construction of a new bridge.\nThe plain of Miliane: 2 km, the arcade reaches up to 20 m in height.\nThe plain of La Soukra, before Carthage: 10 km, the arcade reaches up to 20 m in height.\n\nCross-section\nIn cross-section, the channel measures about 90 cm in width and 130 cm in height. It was closed on top by a vault. The walls were made from Roman cement and were clad with sandstone bossage. The part of the channel which came in contact with water was further clad in waterproof opus signinum. The screed also served to smooth the channel's rate of decline. Ventilation was provided by small, square openings in the roof. At regular intervals on the base of the channel, there were circular depressions, which served to purify the water, since detritus would settle in them. To continue to operate, these had to be cleaned out regularly, so the channel required ongoing care and attention\n\nCisterns\nThe distribution of the water within Carthage is not yet entirely clear. It seems that the channel discharged into two cisterns and the water was further distributed from these. To date, however, archaeological excavations have found no sure signs of discharge into the cisterns.\n\nCisterns of La Malga\nThe cisterns of La Malga form the largest cisterns surviving from the ancient world anywhere. They held approximately 51 million liters. Based on the nature of the mortar, they are dated to the first century AD. It is not yet clear how these cisterns were used in that period, since the aqueduct had not yet been built and this enormous volume could never have been filled by rainwater alone.\n\nCistern of Bordj Djedid\nThe cistern of Bordj Djedid is made up of 18 barrel-shaped basins arranged in parallel and held between 25 and 30 million liters. It was responsible for supplying the Baths of Antonius. The construction date is unknown, but modifications have been detected in connection with the construction of the Baths of Antonius, implying that the cistern preceded the baths.\n\nLater usage\nSince the water supply was essential for the city, the aqueduct was destroyed during the Vandal siege of 439, the Eastern Roman reconquest under Justinian and finally at the conquest of Carthage by the Arabs in 698, but each time it was subsequently restored. In the thirteenth century, one of the Hafsid rulers added a branch leading to his palace in Manouba in order to supply water for his garden. From the sixteenth century, the aqueduct deteriorated rapidly and was employed as a stone quarry.\nIn 1859 a French engineer received the task of restoring the water channel in order to supply Tunis with water. While the majority of the channels at ground level could be reused, the parts of the channel on pillars were mostly destroyed and a modern pressure pipe system was installed. Since it was put into operation in 1862, the channel has remained in use and today it supplies an average of 12,000,000 L per day in winter and 3,000,000 in summer.\n\nImportant Bird Area\nThe cavities and holes in the aqueduct are used as nesting and roosting sites by the lesser kestrel Falco naumanni (30 pairs), but also by the Lanner falcon Falco biarmicus and the common kestrel Falco tinnunculus as well as the European roller Coracias garrulus, rock sparrows Petronia petronia, spotless starlings Sturnus unicolor and common ravens Corvus corax. The site is of particular significance for the lesser krestel as it regularly holds significant numbers the species, (which is a species of global conservation concern).\nThe protected area extends over 40 ha as a band stretching near the Milliana river along the aqueduct 20-m-high pillars and arches in which many cavities and holes used by birds have developed. The surrounding area consists of cereal fields and is a hunting reserve.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of aqueducts in the Roman Empire\nList of Roman aqueducts by date\nAncient Roman technology\nRoman engineering\n\nReferences\nGeneral\n\nFriedrich Rakob. \"Das römische Quellenheiligtum bei Zaghouan in Tunesien\".

This thoroughfare connects Carthage to the Sahara.  Other towns along the way included Sbiba, Sufes, Sbeitla, and Sufetula.  Parts of the old Roman road are in ruins, but others do remain.\n\nHistory\nThuburbo Majus or Colonia Julia Aurelia Commoda, its Roman name, was originally a Punic town, later founded as a Roman veteran colony by Augustus in 27 BC. Military veterans were sent to Thuburbo, among other sites, by Augustus to allow them to start their post-army lives with land of their own.  Its strategic location and access to trade routes made it an important establishment. Ruins of the town are in the middle of the countryside with no towns in close proximity.\nMost of the town was built around 150–200 and restored in the 4th century after the Crisis of the Third Century. It received a Capitolium in 168.  The town was a productive grower of grain, olives, and fruit.  Under Hadrian it was made a municipium, helping cause a growth in wealth, and Commodus made it a colony. The early third century Christian martyr Perpetua was born in the town.\n\nExcavations\nA 1916 excavation found a tetrastyle temple.  The building was decorated with statues of Apollo, Venus, Silvanus, Bacchus, the Dioscuri, and a satyr.  Three perfume vases showed dogs pursuing rabbits.\nIn 1920 an inscription found in Thuburbo Majus written in honor of C. Vettius Sabinianus proved that several other inscriptions bearing that name were referring to the same person.\nRemains of the house of Bacchus and Ariadne dating back to the early 5th century were excavated in 1925.  Researchers found the town to be a valuable site, as evidence of food preparation in a garden was discovered.  Those and other finds point to what daily life in ancient Rome might have been like.  Mosaics found in the town date to the late 4th century.  These mosaics depict items from nature, like a still life arrangement of food items and a sea filled with fish as young people fish from boats. They have been studied by archaeologist Aïcha Ben Abed. Another mosaic represents a nude Venus riding a chariot, with plant life surrounding her to represent well-being and fertility.\nThis town does not have fully restored buildings, but there are remains of a forum, the amphitheatre, temples, baths, houses, and other sites.\n\nBishopric\nThe Bishopric was founded during the Roman Empire and survived through the Arian Vandal and Orthodox Byzantine empires, only ceasing to function with the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. The diocese was refounded in name at least in the 20th century. Known bishops include:\n\nSedatus, present at the Council of Carthage (256),\nFaustus, at the Council of Arles (314),\nCatholic Bishop Cyprianus, at the Council of Carthage (411),\nDonatist Bishop Rufinus, at the Council of Carthage, 411,\nBenenatus, exiled by the Vandal king Huneric, 484.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nScheding, Paul (2019).

It was the entry point of the Muslim conquest of North Africa.\nSbeitla is the capital of the largest delegation in Kasserine Governorate with an area of 1133.5 km2. It is located in 33 km in the west of the governorate, and 264 km to Tunis. It has a population of 23,844 (2014 estimate). Sbeitla is mentioned in Norman Douglas's Fountains in the Sand as being wooded by junipers and Aleppo pines as late as the 19th century, though he found them \"bleak and bare\" in the early 20th century.\n\nHistory\nThe oldest traces of civilisation in the zone are Punic megaliths and funereal stelae.\nThe region was inhabited by nomadic tribes until the Legio III Augusta established a camp at Ammaedara. Through the surrender of the Berber leader Tacfarinas, the region was pacified and populated under the Roman emperor Vespasian and his sons between 67 and 69, becoming a bishopric in the Roman province of Byzacena.\nSome inscriptions found in the city suggest that the settlement had success along the lines of others in North Africa during the 2nd century, reaching great prosperity through the olive industry, whose cultivation benefited from excellent climatic conditions in the region. The olive presses found in the ruins of the city further bolster this conclusion. The resulting prosperity made possible the construction of a splendid forum and other important buildings.\nThe city began to decline during the Late Empire, during which the city was surrounded and occupied by Vandals, a fact that is demonstrated by the appearance of temples dedicated to their gods.\nThe arrival of the Byzantines inaugurated a new period of splendor. In 647, the fields before the city were the site of a major battle between the Byzantines and Berbers of Gregory the Patrician and the Rashidun Caliphate's governor of Egypt, Abdullah ibn Saad. The Battle of Sufetula ended in a decisive Muslim victory, which shook Byzantine control over the region and signalled the beginning of the Muslim conquest of North Africa.\n\nThe caliph at the time of the battle was Uthman ibn Affan, who set the army under the leadership of Abdullah ibn Saad. At his arrival to Barqa, Uqba ibn Nafi and his troops joined the main army and the two commanders prepared together the plan to conquer Sbeitla. The battle was long and hard, and Caliph Uthman sent reinforcement under the leadership of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. The three leaders prepared a new battle plan and they finally succeeded in taking Sufetula.\nThe Muslim conquest marked the end of the diocese of Sufetula, which was however nominally revived as a Catholic titular bishopric.\n\nGeography\nSbeitla is located in western central Tunisia. By road it is 33 kilometres (29 mi) north-east of Kasserine, 246 kilometres (180 mi) south-west of Tunis, and 166 kilometres (141 mi) south-west of Sousse. The city is known by its semi-arid climate.\n\nCulture\nThanks to the well preserved archaeological site with its prestigious Roman forum, the cultural activities in Sbeitla have prospered. An annual festival is organised in the forum.\n\nMuseums\nThe archaeological museum of Sbeitla houses several sculptures and mosaics. It consists of three exhibition rooms: the first one is about the Capsian culture, the second about the rest of Dionysus' empire, and the third contains two mosaics.\n\nFestivals\nSince 2000, the city holds its Spring International festival each year, it is an international celebration where many famous actors like Mahmoud Yacine and authors like Mahmoud Messadi were honored. The city celebrates also its international festival named also festival abadelah of Sbeitla. It was founded in 2000, and it became international in 2013.\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of Sbeitla relays on handicraft, agricultural and petroleum production managed by ETAP in the oil field of Douleb.\nSmuggling goods and oil from Algerian Borders represent a major parallel economy activity in the region.\n\nAgricultural\nThe city is surrounded by a large field of agriculture of olive, almond and animal husbandry. It contains 919 shallow wells, 137 deep wells, a mountain lake and a mountain dam the irrigated Area remains limited to 2930 hectares.\n\nPetroleum industries\nThe Oil field of Douleb is one of the fields explored by ETAP, since April 12, 1968 and it produces 230 000 barrels\\year. In 1974, the field reached it maximal productivity with 1200m3 per day.\n\nHandicraft\nThe majority of handicraft known in Sbeitla relay on wool processing. Tunisian barnous is one of those handcrafts.\n\nSports\nSbeitla's most popular sport club is Union Sportive Sbeitla also known as USS, the club plays in the Tunisian ligue professionnelle 3 before being promoted to ligue 2 in the 2013 season .\nThe team currently plays in the Third Tunisian League. \nOn June 5, 2013, the club advanced to the Quarter-finals of Tunisian Cup for the first time in its history.

قال فيها صاحب معجم الاعلام: «سُبَيْطِلَه: بضم اوله وفتح ثانيه وياءٍ مثناه من تحت وطاءٍ مكسوره ولام، مدينه من مُدُن افريقيه وهي كما يزعمون مدينه جرجير الملك الرومي وبينها وبين القيروان سبعون ميلاً». كما ذكرها الادريسي في كتابه نزهه المشتاق في اختراق الافاق بقوله: «واذ قد انتهى بنا القول في ذكر بلاد افريقيه فلنرجع الان الى ذكر بلاد نفزاوه فنقول ان مدينه سبيطله كانت مدينه جرجير ملك الروم الافارقه وكانت من احسن البلاد منظراً واكبرها قطراً واكثرها مياهاً واعدلها هواء واطيبه ثرى وكانت بها بساتين وجنات وافتتحها المسلمون في صدر الاسلام وقتلوا بها ملكها العظيم المسمى جرجيس ومنها الى مدينه قفصه مرحله وبعض ومنها ايضاً الى القيروان سبعون ميلاً».\nوفي كتاب البلدان لابي العباس اليعقوبي ذُكِرت سبيطله على انها «المدينه القديمه العظمى هي التي يقال لها سبيطله، وهي التي افتتحت في ايام عثمان بن عفان، وحصرها عبد الله بن عمر بن الخطاب، وعبد الله بن الزبير، وامير الجيش عبد الله بن سعد بن ابي سرح سنه سبع وثلاثين».\nاما الحميري فقد ذكر المدينه في كتابه الروض المعطار في خبر الاقطار كالتالي: «وكان عبد الله بن سعد بن ابي سرح لما بعثه عثمان الى افريقيا غازياً لقي جرجير صاحب سبيطله، وقاتله فقتله عبد الله بن الزبير وشن الغارات على سبيطله، واصاب الروم رعب شديد، ولجاوا الى الحصون والقلاع، فاجتمع اكثر الروم بقصر الاجم فطلبوا من عبد الله بن سعد ان ياخذ منهم ثلاثمائه قنطار من ذهب على ان يكف عنهم ويخرج من بلادهم، فقبل ذلك منهم وقبض المال، وكان في شرطه ان ما اصاب المسلمون قبل الصلح فهو لهم وما اصابوه بعد الصلح ردوه لهم». فيها الجمال بكثره\nويضيف نفس المصدر: \"هي مدينه قموده، على سبعين ميلاً من القيروان، وقال عريب: على مسافه يومين من القيروان، قال اليعقوبي: وهو بلد واسع فيه مدن وحصون، والمدينه القديمه العظمى هي التي يقال لها سبيطله.\n\nالعبادله السبعه\nاستاذن عمرو بن العاص والي مصر في عهد الخليفه عمر بن الخطاب في فتح افريقيا، الا انَّ الخليفه لم يستجب لطلبه. وقد اراد من وراء ذلك ان يثبِّت اقدام المسلمين في مصر وطرابلس، فلمَّا كان عهد الخليفه الراشدي عثمان بن عفان اجاب واليه على مصر، الذي تقدم بنفس الطلب، فاُوكِلَت اليه مهمَّه هذه الحمله، وانتقى الخليفه من المدينه خيره ابناء الصحابه منهم:\n\nولذلك تُعرَف الحمله ايضًا بغزوه العبادله السبعه. وهي معركه قامت ما بين المسلمين والروم في القرن الهجري الاول في عهد الخليفه عثمان بن عفان، وقد انتصر المسلمون فيها انتصارًا ساحقًا على الروم، حيث ذكر بعض المؤرخين ان عبد الله بن سعد غزا افريقيه في جماعه من الصحابه، فلقي جرجيرًا في سُبيطله، وهي مدينه على سبعين ميلًا من القيروان، فقتل جرْجيرًا وهو في مائه الف، وصالح ابن ابي سرحٍ اهل الحصون واهل المدائن على مائه الف رطل من الذهب.\nفي القرن العشرين، كانت مدينه سبيطله من المدن التونسيه التي وقعت تحت سيطره الفوج 66 للمشاه الفرنسيه، اثر انزال سريته الاولى في القصبه في تونس العاصمه في 10 سبتمبر 1881.\n\nالحرب العالميه الثانيه\nعاشت سبيطله مثل مختلف مدن ولايه القصرين مواجهات بين جيش المانيا النازيه والجيش الامريكي اثناء الحرب العالميه الثانيه في شمال افريقيا في ما يعرف بحمله تونس، تحت قياده الجنرال الالماني ارفين رومل من ناحيه والجنرال الامريكي لويد فردندال من ناحيه اخرى. دارت احداث هذا الصراع في ما يعرف بمعركه القصرين بين التاسع عشر والخامس والعشرين فيفري 1943. في 16 فيفري 1943، وبعد فوزهم على الجيش الامريكي، هاجمت فرق البانزر 21 للجيش الالماني سبيطله.\n\nالثوره التونسيه\nاثناء الثوره التونسيه، شهدت مدينه سبيطله احتجاجات واسعه ومصادمات مع الامن حتى تاريخ هروب الرئيس التونسي السابق زين العابدين بن علي. وفي شهر جويليه من نفس السنه، كانت المدينه مسرحا لاعمال عنف دارت بين اهالي المدينه وقبيله الهراره من احد الارياف المجاوره. وادت اعمال العنف الى جرح 17 شخصا، ولم يُحسم النزاع الا بتدخل الجيش من ثكنه الهادي خفشه التابعه للمدينه، واعلنت على اثرها وزاره الداخليه حاله حظر تجول في المدينه. بعد الثوره، شهدت المدينه العديد من الاحتجاجات وتدخلات للامن.\nعلى اثر نتائج الانتخابات الرئاسيه التونسيه 2014 شهدت مدينه سبيطله مثل بعض مدن الجنوب احتجاجات تمركزت اساسا في حي السرور. كما حاول المحتجين حرق مقر الحزب نداء تونس، وادت الاحتجاجات الى تدخل الجيش لحمايه المؤسسات الحكوميه.\n\nالجغرافيا\nمدينه سبيطله هي مركز معتمديه سبيطله التي تمتد على مساحه 1133.5 كلم2. وتبعد المدينه عن مركز ولايه القصرين التابعه لها مسافه 32.7 كلم، عبر الطريق الوطنيه رقم 13. و260 كلم عن تونس العاصمه.\n\nخصائص التربه والمناخ\nتتكون اراضي سبيطله بصفه عامه من اراضٍ خصبه دوباليه، واراضي تراسبات، واراضٍ دوباليه عضويه، واراضٍ كلسيه. كما تتميز كاغلب مناطق الجهه بمناخ شبه جاف.\n\nالنقل\nتعتمد مدينه سبيطله بالاساس على الخواص عبر سيارات الاجره اللواج  للنقل بين المدن، وبنسبه اقل على الشركه الجهويه للنقل بالقصرين مدعومه بالشركه الوطنيه للنقل بين المدن. في حين تتكفل شبكه من سيارات تاكسي بتيسير التنقل في المدينه.\nكما ترتبط مدينه سبيطله بشبكه السكك الحديديه منذ مطلع القرن الفارط. حيث قامت شركه بون-قالمه للسكك الحديديه بفتح الخط سبيطله-جلمه في 15 جوان 1908، ويمتد على طول 28.2 كيلومتر، والخط سبيطله-القصرين-هنشير السواطير في غرّه ديسمبر 1909، والذي يتمد على طول 124 كيلومتر.\n\nالتوزع الديمغرافي\nتنقسم معتمديه سبيطله الى 14 عماده وفي ما يلي توزع السكان والاسر والمساكن في مدينه سبيطله حسب احصائيات سنه 2004. ويعتبر حي السرور بشقيه الشرقي والغربي اكثر المناطق العمرانيه اكتظاظًا بالسكان، رغم تهميشه، خاصه من ناحيه البنيه التحتيه والخدمات.\n\nالاقتصاد\nيتركز في مدينه سبيطله معمل الورق الرهيف الذي يعد المصدر الاول لهذا المنتوج في تونس، بالاضافه الى انتاجها المتميز للزيتون واللوز. وبالرغم من وفره الموارد المائيه في معتمديه سبيطله، فان المساحات السقويه بقيت محدوده ولا تتعدى 2930 هكتار.\n\nالنفط والموارد المائيه\nسبيطله هي احدى اكبر الجهات المنتجه للنفط، بل وكذلك الماء. منذ عده سنوات ظلت منطقه سبيطله تضخُّ هاتين المادتين الحيويتين انطلاقا من حقل الدولاب ومن عيونها السطحيه والعميقه عبر قنوات تمتدّ الى صفاقس، وبالرغم من ذلك لا يوجد مسبح بلدي في المدينه.\n\nيقع حقل الدولاب وصمامه في معتمديه سبيطله من ولايه القصرين على بعد قرابه 40 كيلومترًا شمال مدينه القصرين، في منطقه جبليه ارتفاعها 1000 متر، وهو تحت اشراف شركه البحث عن النفط واستغلاله بالبلاد التونسيه. انطلق الانتاج في حقل الدولاب في 12 افريل 1968 وينتج 230,000 برميل سنويًّا، وبلغت الكميه القصوى المنتجه سنه 1974، 1200 متر مكعب يوميًّا. يتكون الحقل من:\n\n4 ابار منتجه بالدولوميت مجهزه بمضخات كهربائيه مغموره.\n4 ابار منتجه بالكلس مجهزه بمضخات متارجحه.\n3 ابار منتجه بالصخر الفيراكوني مجهزه بمضخات متارجحه.\n1 بئر للحقن بالكلس.\n1 بئر للحقن بدولوميت مياه الانتاج.\nوتحيط بمدينه سبيطله غابات من شجر الزيتون واللوز، وبها اربعه معاصر لزيت الزيتون.\n\nالصناعات التقليديه\nمثل باقي مدن الوسط الغربي، تنتشر في سبيطله تربيه الماشيه وهو ما يوفر انتاجيه مرتفعه للصوف والصناعات التقليديه المرتكزه على هذه الماده مثل صناعه الزربيه والبطانيه والبرنوس. وهي صناعات تقليديه منتشره نظرًا لقلَّه تكلفتها، وتوفِّر مورد رزق للعديد من سكان المنطقه.\n\nالسياحه\nتعتبر سبيطله من اشهر المدن الاثريه في تونس نظرًا لتعاقب الحضارات عليها، وساهم موقعها الاثري بالاضافه الى مهرجانيها الدولين السنوين ومركبها السياحي الكابيتول في تنشيط الحركه السياحيه واستقطاب اعداد متزايده من الزائرين الاجانب. وفي 21 جانفي 2015، تنظم ملتقى البلديات السياحيه والمندوبين الجهويين للسياحه من اجل محيط نظيف. اشرف عليه كل من لطفي بن جدو وزير الدّاخليه وامال كربول وزيره السياحه، وفازت فيه بلديه سبيطله بجائزه بقيمه 50 الف دينار. وهو تكريم من شانه دعم النشاط السياحي في المدينه.\n\nالموقع الاثري\nهو اول موقع مزود باضاءه حركيه وبمنظومه ارشادات متكامله.هو اول موقع مزود باضاءه حركيه وبمنظومه ارشادات متكامله. ويضم العديد من الاثار الرومانيه والبيزنطيه التي وقع ترميم اغلبها، وهي تحت رعايه المعهد الوطني للتراث، الذي يشرف في مدينه سبيطله على 12 من مجموع البناءات الاثريه المدرجه في ولايه القصرين.\nويُعتبر قوس دقلديانوس المعلم الاثري المميز للمدينه وهو قوس النصر تم تشيده كهديه لاباطره الرباعي الاول في الحقبه الرومانيه. والذي اسسه الامبراطور الروماني ديوكلتيانوس، في اواخر القرن الثالث لمجابهه هجمات الامازيغ المتكرره والتي يصعب مواجهتها من قبل رجل واحد. عُرف الرباعي الاول بهيمنه ديوكلتيانوس لذلك سمي هذا المعلم الاثري باسمه.\n\nالاثار

على اربع قاعات عرضت داخلها قطع اثريه تصوِّر مختلف جوانب الحياه اليوميه منذ عصر ما قبل التاريخ الى التاريخ الاسلامي، كما توجد فيه صور شمسيه تمثل مواقع او معالم موجوده بالمنطقه.\n\nالثقافه\nالمهرجانات\nتتميز مدينه سبيطله بنشاط ثقافي متميز يهدف للتعريف بها وتوفير انشطه ترفيهيه. من ابرز الفعاليات الثقافيه التي تحتفي بها المدينه نجد مهرجان العبادله الاثري الذي اتخذ صيغته الدوليه منذ سنه 2013، ومهرجان ربيع سبيطله الدولي.\n\nمهرجان العبادله الاثري الدولي\nتاسس المهرجان سنه 1980، واتخذ طابعه الدولي سنه 2013، وبالرغم من ذلك لا يزال المهرجاني يعاني من تقصير وزاره الثقافه، حيث تخصص له ميزانيه 80 الف دينار تونسي. وهو مبلغ غير كاف لتمكين اداره المهرجان من توفير عروض فرجويه متميزه لجماهير المهرجان، وتكتفي بتقديم عروض في اطار التبادل الثقافي.\n\nمهرجان ربيع سبيطله\nتنتظم بسبيطله سنويًا فعاليات مهرجان ربيع سبيطله الدولي من 30 ابريل الى 3 ماي. ويُعرّف الشاعر عدنان الهلالي مدير سابق ومؤسس مهرجان سبيطله الدولي على انه مهرجان اسسه شبّان المدينه حبًّا في مدينتهم، سفيطله القلعه الغابره التي كاد يطويها النسيان في العهود الماضيه رغم انها كانت بوابه الفتح العربي الاسلامي في شمال افريقيا، ومنها دخل العبادله السبعه الى بلاد الامازيغ التي كان يحتلها الروم سنه 647 ميلاديه، وهو فكره لتكريم المدينه تطورت الى مهرجان له شخصيته وطابعه الخاصّان. وتدور جل فعاليات المهرجان في المسرح الروماني.\n\nعيد الرعاه\nكما تحتفل منطقه الوساعيه التابعه لمدينه سبيطله سنويًّا بعيد الرعاه منذ سنه 2011. وهي تظاهره من تنظيم فريق المركز الثقافي الجبلي بالوساعيه، ويتم فيها تكريم الرعاه في اجواء احتفاليه. عرفت هذه التظاهره الفريده نجاحًا لافتًا في دورتيها السابقتين 2011 و2012، اذ تميَّزت فقراتها بالتلقائيه والبساطه التي تطبع حياه الرعاه فكانت سهرات الناي تحت بيوت الشعر والاهازيج الجبليه الاصيله في الموعد، وخرج الصحافيون والضيوف الى جبل سمامه مع القطعان، حيث انتظمت احتفاليات رائقه في اغوار الجبل.\n\nالتعليم\nمن ابرز المؤسسات التعليميه الجامعيه واقدمها بسبيطله المعهد الاعلى لتكوين المعلمين، حيث فتح المعهد ابوابه في 15 سبتمبر 1988 باسم مدرسه ترشيح المعلمين، تم بمقتضى القانون عدد 98 لسنه 1991 والمتعلق بقانون الماليه لسنه 1992 وخاصه الفصل 98 منه تحويل اسمه لما يعرف به اليوم. وبلغ عدد طلبته 325 في السنه الدراسيه 2003-2004.\nثم تم غلق المعهد وتعويضه بالمعهد العالي للدراسات التطبيقيه في الانسانيات، وهو تابع لجامعه القيروان. تاسَّس المعهد سنه 2007 ويختص في الاداب والعلوم الانسانيه. بلغ عدد طلابه 1200 طالب وطالبه، حسب احصائيات سنه 2009.\nويساهم المعهد في تنشيط الحركه الثقافيه في المدينه، حيث انتظم الملتقى العلمي الدولي الاول حول تعدد الثقافات وحواراتها بقاعه الاجتماعات بالمعهد، وهو اول تظاهره علميه عالميه تشهدها ولايه القصرين، حيث شارك فيها ضيوف من الجزائر وفرنسا وامريكا. واختير لهذا الملتقى عنوان تعدد الثقافات وحواراتها. كما توجد بمدينه سبيطله مدرستان اعداديَّتان وثلاثه معاهد ثانويه ومركز قطاعي لتكوين مهن الخدمات ومركز تكوين مهني للحرف.\nتضم المدينه مكتبه العبادله العموميه، والتي وقع تاسيسها في جوان 2006، وتحتوي على قاعه اعلاميه وقاعتي مطالعه تتسع كل منهما لثمانيه واربعون مقعدا.\n\nالرياضه\nينشط في المدينه الاتحاد الرياضي بسبيطله الذي تاسس سنه 1962. وينتمي الى بطوله الرابطه الثالثه مجموعه الوسط. ينشط النادي في ملعب سبيطله وهو متواجد امام معهد الاثار وقرب الموقع الاثري. وهو ملعب غير معشب ويتكون من مدرج واحد. يتراس الفريق في الموسم الحالي (2013-2014) كريم الهاني ويدربه ونيّس بوزيدي. وتتميز تشكيله الفريق بقوه خط الهجوم ممَّا جعله يتصدر الترتيب في المجموعه، حتى تمكن من الصعود الى الرابطه المحترفه الثانيه لكره القدم، والالتحاق بالمجموعه ا.\nفي 9 جوان 2013 ترشَّح الفريق لاول مره في تاريخه للمربع الذهبي لكاس تونس بعد ازاحته فريق الملعب التونسي العريق والحائز علي الكاس ست مرات سابقه، حيث تغلَّب عليه بركلات الترجيح في دور الثمانيه بعد انتهاء اللقاء بالتعادل بفضل ركلات الترجيح (4-2).\nترشح الاتحاد عده مرات لنهائيات كاس الرابطه للهواه والبروموسبور دون ان يفوز به. وفي الموسم 2013-2014، ترشح النادي للدور النهائي بعد فوزه على شبيبه سكره بنتيجه 2-1، ثم فاز للمره الاولى في تاريخه بالكاس اثر تغلبه على مولديه منوبه في ملعب المنزه، في 25 جوان 2014. انتهت المبارات بالتعادل السلبي مما استوجب الالتجاء الى الركلات الترجيحيه التي كانت نتيجتها لصالح سبيطله (3-2)، وفاز النادي بمبلغ 40 الف دينار تونسي.\nكما ينشط في المدينه الجمعيه النسائيه لكره القدم بسبيطله، التي تاسست سنه 2003 ولها فرعان كبريات وصغريات وتنشط في الرابطه الثانيه وتتراس السيده رجاء الدريدي ولديها 40 مجازه.\nيعاني فريق الجمعيه النسائيه من عراقيل بالجمله ابرزها غياب كلي للموارد الماليه القاره وافتقاره الى ملعب يمكنه من ممارسه نشاطه في ظروف طيبه وهو ما ساهم في تعطيل مسيرته نحو الصعود الى الرابطه الاولى كما ان الموارد الماليه المتاتيه سواء من جامعه كره القدم او من وزاره الشباب والرياضه او من البلديه والولايه متواضعه ولا تفي بالحاجه.\nمن ابرز نتائج الفريق في كاس تونس لكره

It was a diocese and is now a Roman Catholic titular see.\n\nHistory\nAmmaedara was on the border between the valleys and the Berber tribes and was part of the Roman province of Byzacena.\nThe Third Augustan Legion (Legio III Augusta) was installed in Ammaedara in 30 BC where they built their first fortress. From here the legion was partly responsible for the urbanisation of the North African provinces, building roads and other infrastructure. Its ruins include mausoleums, Byzantine fortresses, underground baths and a church.\n\nEcclesiastical history\nExcavation of what has been called the Church of Melleus in the centre of Ammaedara has brought to light the tombs of some bishops of the see. In addition, documentary records survive of Eugenius, a bishop of Ammaedara, who participated in the Council of Carthage (255), which discussed the question of the lapsi, and of Speratus and Crescentianus, representing respectively the Catholics and the Donatists of the city, who took part in the Council of Carthage (411) of 411. Later Catholic bishops were Hyacinthus and Melleus, both of the second half of the 6th century.\nGiven the Roman province, it must have been a suffragan of the Metropolitan archbishop of its capital Hadrumetum (modern Sousse, also in Tunisia).\n\nTitular see\nNo longer a residential bishopric, Ammaedara is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

          "content": "Maktar or Makthar (Arabic: مكثر), also known by other names during antiquity, is a town and archaeological site in Siliana Governorate, Tunisia.\nMaktar was founded by the Berber Numidians as a defense post against Carthaginian expansion. At the end of the Third Punic War, it was settled by many Punic refugees after the Romans' destruction of Carthage in 146 BC. Under Roman rule, it obtained the status of a free city under Julius Caesar in 46 BC and became a Roman colony in AD 146. It formed part of the province of Byzacena and was the seat of a Christian bishop. Under the Romans and Byzantines, it reversed its earlier role to serve as a defense post against local Berber attacks. The town survived the Muslim invasions but was destroyed by the Banu Hilal tribe in the 11th century before being reëstablished. The present town had a population of 13,576 in 2014.\n\nName\nThe Carthaginians recorded the town's name variously as mktrm (Punic: 𐤌𐤊𐤕𐤓‬𐤌), mktrʿm (Punic: 𐤌𐤊𐤕𐤓𐤏‬𐤌), and mktʿrym (Punic: 𐤌𐤊𐤕𐤏𐤓‬𐤉𐤌). The Romans latinized the name as Mactaris, which became Colonia Aelia Aurelia Mactaris upon its elevation to colony status. This name was later arabized as Maktar.\n\nGeography\nIt is located around 140 km (87 mi) southwest of Tunis and 60 km (37 mi) southeast of El Kef. The modern town lies on a plateau at around 900 m (2,953 ft) above sea level. It sits on the other side of a ravine from the Roman ruins and is known for its scenic views. The town has a continental climate, with cold winters and warm summers and occasional snowfall during the months of January and February.\n\nHistory\nIn the 3rd century BC the Numidians built a strategic fortress at the site, chosen to control trade routes between Sbeitla, Kairouan, and El Kef. The establishment grew rapidly, and under Masinissa developed into a major center of Numidia. After the fall of Carthage in 146 BC, many Punic refugees flocked to Maktar, bringing their culture and skills. Buildings, civic organization, and language were strongly influenced by the Carthaginians.\nRoman occupation at first retained the Punic government and administration through the consular-style magistracy of the sufetes, while Roman immigrants largely remained in a separate community (pagus). Mactaris grew into one of the richest cities in the province as a transit point for grain, oil, livestock, and textiles between Carthage, Sufetula, Thugga, and Tebessa. Under Trajan (97–117), the city was romanized.  The city received a uniform Roman constitution and colony status, whereby all residents were automatically given Roman citizenship.\nThe troubles of the third century, which ushered in the decline of the Roman Empire, also affected Maktar. The decline was halted awhile under Diocletian (284–305). In late antiquity the Mactaris diocese of the Roman Church was founded, and Christianization of the city could be seen in the construction of numerous churches. The city was mentioned in the 5th-century Notitia provinciarum et civitatum Africae and the Peutinger Map. Maktar survived the invasion of the Vandals and became an important Byzantine fortress.\nMaktar survived the Muslim invasions, but the devastating raid of the Beni Hilal in 1050 led to the complete destruction and abandonment of the site.\n\nArchaeology\nNumerous inscriptions are recorded through the ruins. French archaeological excavations began in 1914, and were continued from 1944 on a large scale. Although not fully excavated, the ruins unearthed so far, especially of the thermal baths and the Schola of the Juvenes, mark this as one of the most remarkable ancient sites in Tunisia.\n\nPre-Roman structures\nThe site has several megaliths, large slabs evidently used in the burial of ashen remains.  Excavations by Mansour Ghaki of an intact burial chamber uncovered many ceramics of various origins, both local and imported, dating from the early third century BC.\nThe site includes an example of Punic mausoleum pyramid, similar to the mausoleum of Atban at Dougga (Thugga).  In addition, archaeologists have unearthed a Numidian-period public square that is thought to be the religious center of the city due to the presence of temples, which later housed a temple to Augustus and Rome.\nThe temple of Hathor Miskar is well known because of the extensive excavations that were carried out there, even if the remains are poorly preserved.  At the center of the sanctuary, archaeologists have found an altar dated to about 100 BC.\nThe Tunisian government included the site in its proposal of 2012 to add various pre-Islamic monuments to the Unesco World Heritage List.\n\nTrajan Forum\nThis rectangular paved gathering place was designed ca 116 AD under Trajan as a forum for the Roman population when Roman citizenship was granted to members of the local elite. (The indigenous population had its own forum 50m to the southwest.) The space was surrounded by a portico, and the south side is still dominated by the majestic and well-preserved Arch of Trajan.\n\nLarge baths\nThe Great Baths are among the best preserved of their kind in North Africa. The walls of the frigidarium rise to 15 m. The building was constructed around the year 200 AD and is decorated with oriental foliage on the capitals and with a beautiful mosaic floor.\n\nScholia Juvenum\nBuilt around the year 200, this building complex was the meeting place of the \"youth organization\" or Brotherhood, a kind of militia of young men, whose duties included policing and especially tax collection. The organization in Maktar consisted of about 70 members, and as in other Roman provincial cities it temporarily played an important role. Membership in the strictly managed organization was a prerequisite for higher  military service. The curriculum of the school included paramilitary exercises and sports, but also subjects such as finance, politics, and culture. The Brotherhood became increasingly influential over time, as rich citizens of provincial cities used it to resist the authority of the central government. In the year 238 the Emperor Gordian I himself joined the organization. Emperor Diocletian restored the school. In the Christian era the original building, called the Basilica, was used as a church, using a Punic sarcophagus from the adjacent necropolis as an altar.\n\nBishopric\nAlthough the Roman diocese effectively ceased operating with the arrival of the Islamic armies, the see remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church, and there have been 20 titular bishops since 1514. The current bishop is Pedro Dulay Arigo\nSix bishops are known from antiquity, including:\n\nMarcus of Mactaris fl 325.\nComparitor fl.411 (Donatist)\nAdelfius fl.484 (Catholic)\nGermanus\nRutilius\nVictor 6th century\n\nCulture\nEach year, the city hosts a festival called the \"Maktaris Festival,\" which boosts the economy of the region.\n\nPopulation\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nGhaki, Mansour (2015), \"Toponymie et Onomastique Libyques: L'Apport de l'Écriture Punique/Néopunique\" (PDF), La Lingua nella Vita e la Vita della Lingua: Itinerari e Percorsi degli Studi Berberi, Studi Africanistici: Quaderni di Studi Berberi e Libico-Berberi, Naples: Unior, pp. 65–71, ISBN 978-88-6719-125-3, ISSN 2283-5636, archived from the original (PDF) on 2020-04-28, retrieved 2018-11-02.

          "summary": "Maktar or Makthar (Arabic: مكثر), also known by other names during antiquity, is a town and archaeological site in Siliana Governorate, Tunisia.\nMaktar was founded by the Berber Numidians as a defense post against Carthaginian expansion. At the end of the Third Punic War, it was settled by many Punic refugees after the Romans' destruction of Carthage in 146 BC. Under Roman rule, it obtained the status of a free city under Julius Caesar in 46 BC and became a Roman colony in AD 146. It formed part of the province of Byzacena and was the seat of a Christian bishop. Under the Romans and Byzantines, it reversed its earlier role to serve as a defense post against local Berber attacks. The town survived the Muslim invasions but was destroyed by the Banu Hilal tribe in the 11th century before being reëstablished. The present town had a population of 13,576 in 2014.",

It is important for the associated fish-processing industry, as well as weaving. It is the capital of Mahdia Governorate.\n\nHistory\nAntiquity\nThe old part of Mahdia corresponds to the Roman city called Aphrodisium and, later, called Africa (a name perhaps derived from the older name), or Cape Africa. The Catholic Church's list of titular sees includes a no longer residential bishopric called Africa and, since there is no record of an episcopal see in Roman times called by either of these names (nor by that of Alipota, another Roman town that Charles Tissot suggested tentatively might be represented by present-day Mehdia), it is supposed that the episcopal see of Africa was established when the city was held by the Kingdom of Sicily, as a part of the Kingdom of Africa (1147–1160) and when Pope Eugene III consecrated a bishop for it in 1148. An inventory of movable property of the church of Africa (inventarium thesauri Africani) exists in an archive of the Cappella Palatina of Palermo in Sicily. Salim Dev identified Mahdia instead with ancient Ruspae or Ruspe, which is more commonly taken to have been at Henchir Sbia (or just Sbia), north of Mahdia, or at the ruins known as Ksour Siad. The most illustrious bishop of this see was Fulgentius of Ruspe. The Catholic Church's list of titular sees, which identifies the see of Africa as Mahdia, identifies Ruspe/Ruspae as Henchir Sbia.\nThe Mahdia shipwreck – a sunken ship found off Mahdia's shore, containing Greek art treasures – is dated to about 80 BC, the early part of Roman rule in this region.\n\nIslamic era\nMuslim Mahdia was founded by the Fatimids under the Caliph Abdallah al-Mahdi and made the capital of Ifriqiya. As the then-newly-created Fatimid Caliphate was a Shi'a regime supported by a Berber Kutama military, the caliph may have been motivated to move his capital here so as to put some distance between his power base and the predominantly Sunni city of Kairouan (the traditional capital of Ifriqiya up to that point). Construction began in 916 and the new city was officially inaugurated on 20 February 921, although some construction continued afterward. In addition to its heavy fortified walls, the city included the Fatimid palaces, an artificial harbor, and a congregational mosque (the Great Mosque of Mahdia). Most of the Fatimid city has not survived to the present day. The mosque, however, is one of the most well-preserved Fatimid monuments in the Maghreb, although it has been extensively damaged over time and was in large part reconstructed by archeologists in the 1960s. Fragments of mosaic pavements from the palaces have also been discovered from modern excavations. \nThe Zirid dynasty, which succeeded the Fatimids in the Maghreb, moved their capital here in 1057. In 1087, the town was attacked by raiding ships from Genoa and Pisa who burned the Muslim fleet in the harbor. The attack played a critical role in Christians' seizure of control of the Western Mediterranean, which allowed the First Crusade to be supplied by sea. Their rule was brought to an end by the Norman conquest of the city in 1148. In 1160 the city came under Almohad rule.\n\nal-Bakri, in the 11th century, wrote about the city:\"The city of Mahdia is named after Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi, who built it, as mentioned in historical records. It is sixty miles from Kairouan. The sea surrounds it on three sides, and it can only be entered from the western side. It has a large suburb known as Zwaila, where markets, public baths, and the homes of its inhabitants are located. Al-Mu‘izz ibn Badis built a wall around this suburb. The city itself is about two miles long, with its width varying—it is never as wide as its full length. All its buildings are made of stone. The city has iron gates with no wood in them, each gate weighing a thousand quintals. Each gate is thirty spans long, with each nail in them weighing six pounds. The gates are decorated with depictions of animals. [..] Mahdia serves as a harbor for ships from Alexandria, the Levant, Sicily, al-Andalus, and other places. Its port is carved into solid rock and can accommodate thirty ships.\"\nThe role of the capital was taken over by Tunis in the 12th century during the Almohad era, which it remained during the Hafsid Dynasty. Later the city was subject to many raids. In 1390 it was the target of the Barbary Crusade, when a French army laid siege to the city but failed to take it.\nThe city was captured by the Spaniards in 1550. A Spanish garrison remained there until 1553. Charles V then offered the charge of the town to the Order of Saint John who ruled Malta but they refused it deeming it too expensive. The emperor ordered the Viceroy of Sicily, Juan de Vega, to dismantle Mahdia despite it being a strategically important stronghold. The demolition tasks were carried out by Hernando de Acuña. Shortly after Mahdia was reoccupied by the Ottomans, but only to live by fishing and oil-works, and the town lost its logistic and commercial importance. It remained under Turkish rule until the 19th century.\nDuring the Nazi Occupation of Tunisia in World War II, Mahdia was the site where Khaled Abdelwahhab hid approximately two dozen persecuted Jews.\n\nTransport\nGare Mahdia forms the southern terminus of the metre-gauge Sahel Metro railway line, which runs from Sousse and Monastir.\n\nClimate\nGallery of images\nSee also\nEuropean enclaves in North Africa before 1830\nMahdia shipwreck\nList of cities in Tunisia\n\nReferences\nNotes\nExternal links\n\ntourismtunisia.com Archived 2010-11-23 at the Wayback Machine (in English)\nLookLex / Tunisia Archived 2010-11-25 at the Wayback Machine\nMahdia Portal\n\"Mahdia\" .

المدينه\nتعتبر مدينه المهديه ثاني عواصم الخلافه بافريقيه ولئن عرفت فترات تاريخيه متعاقبه منذ القدم فان الغموض يكتنف تاريخ هذه المدينه قبل العهد الفاطمي رغم تنوع الاثار الموجوده بالجهه من ناحيه البرّ والبحر والتي تشير الى وجود تجمع سكني بالمنطقه منذ الفتره البونيه.\nوقد امتدت الحقبه التاريخيه التي ميزت المدينه منذ تاسيس الفاطميين لها وجعلها عاصمه للخلافه الفاطميه سنه 308هـ./920م، حيث اتخذها الخليفه الاول عبيد الله الفاطمي عاصمه وذلك لموقعها الجغرافي المميز فهي تطل على البحر من ثلاث جهات جعلت من المدينه حصنا منيعا قادرا على التصدي للغزوات الخارجيه وجعلتها مركزا تجاريا هاما بحوض البحر الابيض المتوسط.\nيقول المؤرخ حسن حسني عبد الوهاب عن المهديه في كتابه خلاصه تاريخ تونس”المهديه مدينه جليل قدرها، شهير في قواعد الاسلام ذكرها، وهي من بناء عبيد الله المهدي اول خلفاء العبيديين واليه تنتسب، وكان ابتداء بنائه لها سنه 303هـ/ 915م وجعلها دار مملكته.\nواول ما ابتنى منها سورها الغربي الذي فيه ابوابها، ثم امر بحفر مرسى المدينه، وكان حجرا صلدا، فنقره نقرا وجعله حصنا لمراكبه الحربيه، واقام على فم هذا المرسى سلسله من حديد رفع احد طرفيها عند دخول السفن ثم تعاد كما كانت، تحصينا للمرسى من دخول مراكب الروم وابتنى ” دار الصناعه” وهي من عجائب الدنيا، ثم شرع في حفر الاهراء بداخل المدينه، وبنى الجباب والمصانع، واختزن الاهراء بالطعام، وملا الجباب (جمع جب) بالماء.\nوكان اتساع المهديه في اول بناءها من الجوف الى القبله قدر غلوه سهم، فاستصغرها المهدي عند ذلك، فردم من البحر مقدارها وادخله في المدينه فاتسعت، والجامع الاعظم الان والدار المعروفه في القديم بدار المحاسبات من ما من البحر. وابتنى لسائر الناس مدينه اخرى تسمى زويله وهي احدى المهديتين وبينهما قدر غلوه سهم، وجعل الاسواق والفنادق فيها، وادار بها خندق متسعه تجتمع بها الامطار، فكانت كالربض لمدينه المهديه. وكان بخارجها الحمى المعروفه بحمى زويله، وكان كله جنات وبساتين بسائر الثمار وانواع الفاكهه\"\nبعد خروج المعز لدين الله الخليفه الفاطمي الى مصر سنه 360هـ./970م، وتاسيس مدينه القاهره حكم الصنهاجيين افريقيه ولكنهم تالبوا فيما بعد على الفاطميين فانتقم هؤلاء منهم وارسلوا اليهم القبائل الهلاليه التي ساهمت في نشر قدر كبير من الفوضى، ومنذ ذلك التاريخ توالت الحملات ضد المدينه من الاساطيل الاوروبيه وخاصه الاسبانيه حيث تراوحت حال المدينه بين السقوط والاسترداد وقد انتهى كل ذلك بتدميرها وحرقها من طرف الاسبان في 1555م. وقد فقدت بذلك اهميتها كعاصمه الى ان قامت العناصر التركيه باعاده اعمارها من جديد حيث اعطتها طابعا جديدا تحولت بموجبه الى مدينه نشطه يتعايش فيها المسلمون والمسيحيون واليهود ويرتكز اقتصادها على قطاعات متعدّده.\nوفي فتره الاحتلال الفرنسي للبلاد التونسيه ساهمت المهديه في الحركه الوطنيه التونسيه والكفاح وانجبت ثله من المناضلين وشاركت في فتره الاستقلال في بناء تونس الحديثه، وعرفت فيما بعد نقله نوعيه على جميع المستويات جعلت من المدينه قبله الزوار من الداخل والخارج وجعلتها من اجمل مدن المتوسط.\n\nالموقع الجغرافي\nتقع مدينه المهديه (ويطلق عليها المدينه ذات الهلالين) على الساحل الشرقي بوسط الجمهوريه التونسيه وهي عباره عن برزخ ممتد داخل البحر (شبه جزيره) يحيط بها البحر من ثلاث جهات وهي ذات مناخ معتدل تؤثر فيها التيارات الهوائيه للحوض المتوسط وتبعد عن العاصمه 200 كلم\nان انتماء المهديه الى الساحل يجعلها تحت تاثير المناخ المتوسطي المعتدل المتميز بنسبه من الرطوبه. وتساهم الرياح البحريه والشماليه والشماليه الشرقيه في تعديل درجات الحراره صيفا وشتاء، وتبلغ نسبه التساقطات على الشريط الساحلي 300مم لتصل في بعض الاحيان الى 400مم، ما يساهم في انتشار غطاء نباتي متنوع.\n\nالمناخ الثقافي\nمثل المدينه العتيقه بالمهديه عاملا من عوامل تطور السياحه بالمنطقه وذلك لثراء مخزونها التراثي والتاريخي والثقافي، هذا الى جانب اختلاف الانشطه بهذه المدينه ومدى مواكبتها للتنميه التي تشهدها المهديه في مختلف مراحلها، ومساهمتها في استقطاب الوافدين على المدينه باعتبارها مسلكا سياحيا فريدا من نوعه.\nفثراء المعالم الاثريه دليل على تعاقب الحضارات بالمدينه وتنوعها مما دفع بالبلديه الى دعم مجهودات ترميم الاثار وصيانتها، كما تتميز المدينه العتيقه بطابع معماري مميز من حيث تنوع اشكال المعمار التقليدي ويرجع السبب في ذلك الى اختلاف الوافدين قديما من مختلف الاصقاع.\nكما يوجد فيها الجامع الكبير والقصبه التي تم بناءها اواخر القرن السادس عشر. وبين الجامع والقصبه اثار رومانيه قديمه كثيره.\nتسير طريق جنوب المهديه عبر مزارع كثيره يتم ريّها بواسطه الدلو الذي تقوم الحيوانات بتشغيله واستخراج\nالمياه من الابار الكثيره الموجوده في المنطقه، وهي عاده للري معروفه ومنتشره في كل انحاء المغرب، حتى تصل\nالطريق الى قصور الساف بمسافه 12 كلم جنوب المهديه، وهي مدينه صغيره. يتفرع شارع الى الشرق ناحيه الجم.\nوتستمر الطريق بمحاذات الساحل الى شِبّه فوق الشاطئ الذي ينتهي داخل البحر ب (راس قبوديه) مع وجود ميناء صغير فيه، وبرج قديم من العصور الوسطى. ثم تتابع الطريق عبر التلال الخضراء حول جبنيانه حتى تصل جنوبا الى مدينه صفاقس.\nتتميز المهديه بانها مركز نشط لصيادي الاسماك، لذا انشات فيها صناعه تعليب السمك، بالاضافه الى الاعمال اليدويه والحرفيه التقليديه.\nسوق علي بابا\nتتحوّل بوابه السقيفه الكحله الى سوق علي بابا، الشبيه بذلك الذي ورد في قصص الف ليله وليله. واثناء السوق الاسبوعيه التي تقام يوم الجمعه في المدينه، يعرض النساء اللّواتي يشتغلن بالحياكه والتطريز والنسيج منتجاتهنّ من الملابس التقليديّه الغايه في الجمال، ومنسوجاتهن المصنوعه من الحرير المذّهب، ومصوغاتهن التقليديه ذات التصاميم المتنوعه. وتمثل زياره هذه السوق فرصه للاطّلاع على هذه الصناعات التقليديّه النسويّه، التي تمثّل احدى العلامات المميّزه للصناعات التقليديّه التونسيّه.\nويحتل التزيين الداخلي للمنازل التونسيه مكاناً بارزاً في المهديّه بشكل خاص، حيث تصبح تحفه حقيقيه، ويبدو ذلك واضحاً في منازل الاثرياء، خصوصاً في نهج الحمزوات الذي به العديد من المنازل الجميله المبنيّه في اوائل القرن العشرين الميلادي من قبل افراد عائله واحده. وتتميز المهديّه بذلك البهاء التقليدي المميّز للمدن البحريّه، فهي تضم ميناء صيد بحري يعد احد اهم الموانيء في تونس، ويختصّ بصيد سمك الساردين بالاعتماد على الاضواء ليلاً، ممّا يجعل ليالي الصيف في هذا المدينه تتحوّل عند مغادره سفن الصيد باتجاه البحر، الى مناسبات فرح جميله، حيث ينار الميناء والبحر بالاف المصابيح، ويصبح شاطىء المدينه محل حركه كبيره عند خيوط الفجر الاولى في ايّام فصل الصيف، ويخترق جنباته صراخ باعه السمك، ووصول مئات الصناديق من سمك الساردين والانشوّجه، التي تم صيدها في اعالي البحار.\n\nاهم المواقع الاثريه والتاريخيه\nباب الفتوح (او باب زويله)\n«السقيفه الكحله» كما تسمى حاليا: يعود بناء هذا المعلم الى اوائل القرن الرابع هجري (303 هـ 308 هـ) الموافق لاوائل القرن العاشر ميلادي (916 م – 921 م)\nوهو يمثل البرج الرئيسي للسور البري لمدينه المهديه، كما كان يمثل المدخل الوحيد للمدينه برا. يتكون باب زويله من برج يبلغ علوه 18.50م في حين يبلغ عرضه حوالي 21 م وعمقه 12.70 م\nوكذلك من ممر مغطى يؤدي مباشره الى الاسواق، يبلغ طوله 33 م وعرضه حوالي 5.10 م.\nمنذ اوائل القرن العاشر حتى اواسط القرن السادس عشر كان الممر يحتوي على سته ابواب حديديه.\nادخلت على هذا المعلم العديد من التحويرات بعد هدم الاسوار من قبل الاسبان سنه 1555،\nاخر هذه التحويرات سنه 1311 هـ الموافق لسنه 1893 م.\n\nقصر القائم بامر الله\nبناه عبيد الله المهدي في اوائل القرن العاشر لابنه وخليفته القائم بامر الله، وتواصل استعماله كقصر من قبل الامراء الزيريين،\nوقد وقع هدمه واستعمال حجارته بعد الاحتلال الاسباني للمدينه (اواسط القرن السادس عشر). مكنت الحفريات الجاريه\nبهذا المعلم من اكتشاف فسيفساء تفوق مساحتها 60 م2 ومن الارجح انها كانت تزين ارضيه القاعه الكبرى للقصر.\n\nالجامع الكبير\nتزامن بناء هذا الجامع مع تاسيس المدينه في اوائل القرن العاشر ميلادي (اوائل القرن الرابع هجري)،\nوكان يعتبر الجامع الرئيسي المخصص للخليفه ولحاشيته. طرات عليه عديد التغييرات خاصه في اواسط القرن السادس عشر ميلادي حيث حوله الاسبان الى كنيسه ومقبره لقواد الجيش. وقع تجديده سنه 1962\nمع احترام مساحته الاصليه والابقاء على واجهته الرئيسيه ومدخله الذي يشبه قوس النصر الروماني.\nومن خصائصه انه لا يحتوي على مئذنه.\n\nمصنع السفن (او دار البحر)\nهو ثاني مصنع للسفن احدث بالمهديه الفاطميه، اسسه المعز لدين الله الفاطمي، كان يحتوي على مراسي سفن ومخازن مغطاه.\nتواصل اشتغال هذا المصنع الى العهد الحفصي حيث كان يعتبر خلال القرن السادس عشر ميلادي من اهم المصانع الى جانب مصنعي تونس وبجايه.\n\nالميناء القديم\nيحتل هذا الميناء منخفضا يفصل بين مرتفع سيدي جابر ومرتفع البرج الكبير، على الساحل الجنوبي الشرقي لشبه جزيره المهديه،\nفهو يوجد اذن في موقع محمي من الرياح الشماليه الغربيه ويفتح على مياه عميقه. اثبتت البحوث الحديثه ان هذا الميناء المنقور في الحجاره يعود الى العهد البوني\nوتواصل استعماله كمرسى للسفن التجاريه والحربيه الى العهد العثماني (اواسط القرن 18 ميلادي).\nتبلغ مساحه هذا الميناء المستطيل الشكل 8250 م2، في حين يفوق عمقه الاصلي 10 امتار وبامكانه احتواء 30 مركبا.\nلا تزال اثار الاسوار المحيطه به وا البرجان اللذان يحرسان مدخله بارزه.\n\nالبرج العثماني\nوقع بناءه في اواخر القرن السادس عشر ميلادي من قبل الاتراك العثمانيين عندما استقروا نهائيا بالمهديه.\nومن الارجح انه بني على انقاض قصر عبيد الله المهدي، وهو برج عسكري مخصص لاحتواء الحاميه الانكشاريه.بني على انقاض البرج الفاطمي واسم مؤسسه لا يزال مكتوبا عليه رغم اختلاف المؤرخين في سبب اعاده بنائه فقد امر القبطان سنان باشا المهندس سنان اغا باعاده ترميمه الا انه وجده مدمرا تماما من الاسبان ومن جسن الحظ ان المخطط وجد في مكان ما جلبه احدهم الى المهندس سنان اغا فبدا في اعاده بنائه مستعملا حجاره من كل مكان منها ما جلب من انقاض قصر الامر بالله ابن عبيد الله المهدي ومنها ما جلب من مناطق اخرى واتم بناءه من فضل الله احمد باشا واسمه مكتوب على المعلم\n\nجامع الحاج مصطفى حمزه\nبني هذا الجامع على نفقه الحاج مصطفى حمزه سنه 1772. وقد شهد هذا المعلم عمليات توسيع وترميم عديده\nخاصه في القرن العشرين.\nويعتبر هذا الجامع من اهم المعالم الدينيه الموجوده بمدينه المهديه نظرا لانه يضم كل المقاييس المعماريه المميزه للمسجد الجامع في الفتره العثمانيه.\n\nالمدينه العتيقه\nتمثل المدينه العتيقه بالمهديه عاملا من عوامل تركز السياحه وتطورها بالمنطقه وذلك لثراء مخزونها التراثي والتاريخي والثقافي،\nهذا الى جانب اختلاف الانشطه بهذه المدينه ومدى مواكبتها للتنميه التي تشهدها المهديه في مختلف مراحلها،\nومساهمتها في استقطاب الوافدين للمدينه باعتبارها مسلكا سياحيا فريدا من نوعه.\nفثراء المعالم الاثريه دليل على تعاقب الحضارات بالمدينه وتنوعها مما دفع بالبلديه الى دعم مجهودات ترميم الاثار وصيانتها،\nكما تتميز المدينه العتيقه بطابع معماري مميز من حيث تنوع اشكال المعمار التقليدي ويرجع السبب في ذلك\nالى اختلاف الوافدين قديما من مختلف الاصقاع، وتسعى البلديه جاهده للحفاظ على الطابع المعماري التقليدي وذلك من خلال:\n\nالتنسيق مع المعهد الوطني للتراث عند اسناد رخص البناء بالمدينه العتيقه.\nاعتماد كراس شروط خصوصي لصيانه المدينه العتيقه.\nابراز دور «البيت المخبر» من حيث كيفيه البناء واعاده

الفوضوي.\n\nالمساهمه في تهيئه المنطقه بالتنسيق مع صندوق حمايه وتهيئه المناطق السياحيه من تعبيد الانهج وتبليط الازقه وتركيز التنوير التجميلي والتنوير العمومي...\nان المتامل في المدينه العتيقه يلاحظ نوعا خاصا من التقسيم الحضري فهي شبه جزيره تتوسطها الاحياء السكنيه التي تستغل قرابه 45 % من المساحه الجمليه للمدينه. ويربط التجمعات السكنيه والمدينه الحديثه الحي التجاري او ما يطلق عليه السوق العربي ويتسع ل: 35 % من المساحه اما المنطقه الثالثه المتبقيه فهي المقبره البحريه ومساحتها 20 % علما وان المساحه الجمليه للمدينه العتيقه تفوق الكلم مربع.\nيقطن التجمعات السكنيه قرابه 5500 ساكن تختلف انشطتهم بين صيادين وفلاحين وموظفين (800 صياد- 1000 موظف...)\nواهم نشاط في المدينه هو نشاط الصيد البحري من حيث عدد المشتغلين في هذا القطاع وارتباط هذا النشاط بالحياه اليوميه\nلكافه متساكني المنطقه اذ هو مورد الرزق الاوحد لعدد كبير من العائلات.\nاما بالنسبه للمنطقه التجاريه فهي تضم 305 محل تجاري ومهني وخدماتي مقسمه كالاتي:\nنوع النشاط العدد النسبه\n\nمحلات تجاريه 172 56 %\nمحلات مهنيه 84 27%\nمحلات خدماتيه 49 17%\nهذا اضافه الى 5 مؤسسات اداريه وتعليميه واقتصاديه عامه وتمثل عدد المحلات التي تتعاطى انشطه للصناعات التقليديه 91 محلا اي بنسبه تقارب الـ 30 % من النشاط وتشمل خاصه صناعه المصوغ ونسيج الحرير.\nولمزيد تنشيط المدينه وخاصه الاحياء التجاريه تجتهد البلديه بالتنسيق مع صندوق حمايه وتهيئه المناطق السياحيه على تهيئه هذه الاحياء الى جانب حث اصحاب المحلات على تحسين واجهات محلاتهم والتعريف بالطابع المعماري التقليدي للمدينه العتيقه\nكما تضم هذه المنطقه السوق المركزي و«سوق التركي» للصناعات التقليديه و«دار الهمه» للتعريف باللباس التقليدي ونقابه التوجيه السياحي و«دار الحرفي» الى جانب تواجد المناطق الخضراء بساحه القاضي النعمان وساحه البيئه ومنطقه راس افريقيا (وراء المناره البحريه).\n\nوما يميز المنطقه التجاريه كثافه المرافق الخدماتيه والسياحيه من مقاهي واثار فهي اضافه الى المعالم الاثريه للعهد الفاطمي (الجامع الكبير والسقيفه الكحلاء) او العثماني (البرج الكبير) تتواجد المعالم الدينيه الاخرى من جوامع وزوايا وكتاتيب ومدرسه قرانيه الى جانب مقام الاولياء الصالحين التي توليها البلديه عنايه فائقه من حيث الترميم والتعهد والصيانه والتجميل باعتبار هذه المعالم ارثا قيما.\n\nالمنشات\nالمنشات الشبابيه والثقافيه\nالمتحف الجهوي.\nدار الشباب.\nدار الثقافه.\nنادي الشباب.\nمكتبه عموميه جهويه.\nثلاث

This origin is linked to the settlement of Andalusian Moors in the area at the beginning of the 17th century. In Spanish, the term zaguán refers to a hallway or vestibule, typically serving as a transitional space between the exterior and interior of a building.\nHowever, Zaghouan is the presumed site of the ancient city of Zica or Ziqua, which may have been the source of the modern name. The city was among the many of sufficient importance in the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis to become a suffragan diocese of the Metropolitan of Carthage, in the papal sway, yet was to fade completely, probably at the seventh century advent of Islam.\nIts historically documented bishops were :\n\nDonatist schismatic Donatus attended the Council of Carthage in 411, where his heresy was condemned as such by the Catholic bishops, among whom Zica had no counterpart\nVincentius intervened at the Council of Carthage in 484 called by king Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom, and was afterwards exiled like most Catholic bishops.\n\nClimate\nGallery\nSee also\nList of Catholic dioceses in Tunisia\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources and external links\nGCatholic - (former &) titular see of Zica\nBibliography - Zica bishopric\nJ.
