      "content": "Kairouan (UK: , US: ), also spelled El Qayrawān or Kairwan (Arabic: ٱلْقَيْرَوَان, romanized: al-Qayrawān [æl qɑjrɑˈwæːn] , Tunisian Arabic: Qeirwān [qɪrˈwɛːn] ), is the capital of the Kairouan Governorate in Tunisia and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city was founded by the Umayyads around 670, in the period of Caliph Mu'awiya (reigned 661–680); this is when it became an important centre for Sunni Islamic scholarship and Quranic learning, attracting Muslims from various parts of the world. The Mosque of Uqba is situated in the city.\n\nEtymology\nThe name (ٱلْقَيْرَوَان al-Qayrawān) is an Arabic word meaning \"military group\" or \"caravan\", borrowed early on from the Middle Persian word kārawān (modern Persian کاروان kârvân), meaning \"military column\" (kâr \"people/military\" + vân \"outpost\") or \"caravan\" (see caravanserai). In Berber, the city used to be called تيكيروان Tikirwan, thought to be an adaptation of the Arabic name. It has also been romanized as Cairoan in early modern English.\n\nHistory\nFoundation and early Islamic period\nThe foundation of Kairouan dates to about the year 670 when the Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi of Caliph Mu'awiya selected a site in the middle of a dense forest, then infested with wild beasts and reptiles, as the location of a military post for the conquest of the West. Formerly, the city of Kamounia was located where Kairouan now stands. It had housed a Byzantine garrison before the Arab conquest, and stood far from the sea – safe from the continued attacks of the Berbers who had fiercely resisted the Arab invasion. Berber resistance continued, led first by Kusaila, whose troops killed Uqba at Biskra about fifteen years after the establishment of the military post, and then by a Berber woman called Al-Kahina who was killed and her army defeated in 702. Subsequently, there occurred a mass conversion of the Berbers to Islam. Kharijites or Islamic \"outsiders\" who formed an egalitarian and puritanical sect appeared and are still present on the island of Djerba.\nIn October 741, in the course of the Great Berber Revolt in the Maghreb, the Ifriqiyan army, along with a Syrian force dispatched by the caliph, was destroyed by the Berbers at the Battle of Bagdoura. The governor Kulthum ibn Iyad al-Qasi perished in the field, his nephew and successor Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri was holed up with the remnant of the army in Spain, leaving the whole of Ifriqiya open to the advance of the Berber rebels. Not having any more forces at his disposal, the Umayyad Caliph Hisham quickly appointed Handhala ibn Safwan as governor of Ifriqiya, with supervisory authority over all the Maghreb (North Africa west of Egypt) and al-Andalus (Spain), and instructed him to take whatever forces he could gather to defend Ifriqiya and quash the Berber rebellion. Leaving Egypt in the hand of Hafs ibn al-Walid ibn Yusuf al-Hadrami, Handhala set out westwards in February 742, picking up additional forces from Barqa (Cyrenaica) and Tripoli (Tripolitana). He arrived in Kairouan around April, 742. The qadi of Ifriqiya, Abd al-Rahman ibn Oqba al-Ghaffari, had been managing the defense of Kairouan, and succeeded in fending off an attack by the Berber rebel army raised in southern Tunisia by the Sufrite leader Oqasha ibn Ayub al-Fezari. Handhala ibn Safwan arrived in Kairouan just as Oqasha was said to be mounting a new attack, in coordination with another large Berber army coming in from the west, led by Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid al-Hawwari. The Berber rebel armies were to make junction in front of Kairouan, before launching their final attack on the city. Wasting no time, Handhala dispatched a cavalry force to slow down Abd al-Wahid's progress, and threw the bulk of his forces south, defeating Oqasha in a bloody battle at El-Qarn and taking him prisoner. But Handhala had taken a lot of losses himself, and now faced the unhappy prospect of Abd al-Wahid's gigantic army, said to be some 300,000, ostensibly the largest Berber army ever seen. Hurrying back, Handhala is said to have put the entire population of Kairouan under arms to bolster his ranks, before setting out again. In perhaps the bloodiest encounter in the Berber wars, Handhala ibn Safwan defeated the great Berber army of Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid at al-Asnam in May 742 (perhaps a little later), just three miles outside of Kairouan. Some 120,000–180,000 Berbers, including Abd al-Wahid, fell in the field of battle in that single encounter.\n\nAghlabid period\nIn 745, Kharijite Berbers captured Kairouan, which was already at that time a developed city with luxuriant gardens and olive groves. Power struggles continued until Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab recaptured Kairouan at the end of the 8th century.\n\nIn 800 Caliph Harun ar-Rashid in Baghdad confirmed Ibrahim as emir and hereditary ruler of Ifriqiya. Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab founded the Aghlabid dynasty which ruled Ifriqiya between 800 and 909. The new emirs embellished Kairouan and made it their capital. It soon became famous for its wealth and prosperity, reaching the levels of Basra and Kufa and giving Tunisia a period of power and prosperity.\nThe Aghlabids built the great mosque and established in it a university that was a centre of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences. Its role can be compared to that of the University of Paris in the Middle Ages. In the 9th century, the city became a brilliant focus of Arab and Islamic cultures attracting scholars from all over the Islamic World. In that period Imam Sahnun and Asad ibn al-Furat made of Kairouan a temple of knowledge and a magnificent centre of diffusion of Islamic sciences. The Aghlabids also built palaces, fortifications and fine waterworks of which only the pools remain. From Kairouan envoys from Charlemagne and the Holy Roman Empire returned with glowing reports of the Aghlabid palaces, libraries and gardens – and from the crippling taxation imposed to pay for their drunkenness and sundry debaucheries. The Aghlabids also pacified the country and conquered Sicily in 827.\n\nFatimid and Zirid period\nIn 893, through the mission of Abdullah al Mahdi, the Kutama Berbers from the west of the country started the movement of the Shiite Fatimids. The year 909 saw the overthrow of the Sunni Aghlabids who ruled Ifriqiya and the establishment of the Fatimid dynasty. During the rule of the Fatimids, Kairouan was neglected and lost its importance: the new rulers resided first in Raqqada but soon moved their capital to the newly built Al Mahdiyah on the eastern coast of Tunisia. After succeeding in extending their rule over all of central Maghreb, an area consisting of the modern countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, they eventually moved east to Egypt to found Cairo making it the capital of their vast Caliphate and leaving the Zirids as their vassals in Ifriqiya. Governing again from Kairouan, the Zirids led the country through another artistic, commercial and agricultural heyday. Schools and universities flourished, overseas trade in local manufactures and farm produce ran high and the courts of the Zirids rulers were centres of refinement that eclipsed those of their European contemporaries. When the Zirids declared their independence from Cairo and their conversion to Sunni Islam in 1045 by giving allegiance to Baghdad, the Fatimid Caliph Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah sent as punishment hordes of troublesome Arab tribes (Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym) to invade Ifriqiya. These invaders so utterly captured Kairouan from the Zirids in 1057 and destroyed it that it never regained its former importance and their influx was a major factor in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant. Some 1,700 years of intermittent but continual progress was undone within a decade as in most part of the country the land was laid to waste for nearly two centuries.\n\nLater history\nAl-Idrisi described the city in the 12th century:The city of Kairouan is the mother of settlements and the capital of regions. It was once the greatest city of the West in its expanse, the most populous, the wealthiest, the most prosperous, the most finely built, and the most ambitious, with the most profitable trade, the highest tax revenues, the most flourishing markets, and the greatest commercial gains, while its people were also the most rebellious and the most arrogant of the ignorant, yet among its virtuous elite, the dominant qualities were adherence to righteousness, fulfillment of covenants, avoidance of doubtful matters, abstention from prohibitions, mastery of refined sciences, and an inclination toward moderation. But God Almighty afflicted it with the Arabs, and calamities befell it one after another, until nothing remained of it but fading ruins and obliterated traces. In our present time, only a portion of it is enclosed by an earthen wall. Its rulers are Arabs, who collect whatever revenues remain. A few people still reside there, engaged in modest trade with meager benefits. Scholars speculate that it will soon return to its former state of prosperity and grandeur. Its water supply is scarce, and its inhabitants drink from the great cistern (majel) within the city. This cistern is an architectural marvel, as it is built in a square shape with a tower-like structure rising in the center. Each side measures two hundred cubits, and it remains filled with water. Kairouan was originally two cities: one was Kairouan itself, and the other was Sabra. Sabra was the royal residence, and at the height of its prosperity, it contained three hundred baths—most of them private, while the rest were public for all people. Sabra, however, is now in complete ruin, devoid of any inhabitants.\nIn the 13th century under the prosperous Hafsids dynasty that ruled Ifriqiya, the city started to emerge from its ruins. It is only under the Husainid Dynasty that Kairouan started to find an honorable place in the country and throughout the Islamic world.\nIn 1881, Kairouan was taken by the French, after which non-Muslims were allowed access to the city. The French built the 600 mm (1 ft 11+5⁄8 in) Sousse–Kairouan Decauville railway, which operated from 1882 to 1996, before it was regauged to 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) gauge.\nThe old city of Kairouan and its associated historic monuments became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988.\nIn December 2023, about 30m of wall near the Gate of the Leather Workers collapsed during restoration. Three masons were killed, and several others injured.\n\nGeography\nLocation\nKairouan, the capital of Kairouan Governorate, lies south of Sousse, 50 km (31 mi) from the east coast, 75 km (47 mi) from Monastir and 184 km (114 mi) from Tunis.\n\nClimate\nKairouan has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh).\n\nDemographics\nIn 2014, the city had about 187,000 inhabitants.\n\nReligion\nBetween the 9th and 11th centuries AD, Kairouan functioned as one of the great centers of Islamic civilization and gained a reputation as a hotbed of scholarship across the entire Maghreb. During this period, the Great Mosque of Kairouan became both a place of prayer and a center for teaching Islamic sciences under the Maliki current. A unique religious tradition practiced in Kairouan was the use of Islamic law to enforce monogamy by stipulating it in the marriage contract. Local tradition holds that seven pilgrimages to the Great Mosque equals one pilgrimage to Mecca. According to some, this makes Kairouan the fourth holiest city in Islam after Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. As of 2004, the city contained 89 mosques. Sufi festivals are held in the city in memory of saints.\nBefore the arrival of the French in 1881, non-Muslims were forbidden from living in Kairouan. A Christian community had existed during the early 11th century alongside Jews who were among the original settlers of Kairouan. The Jewish community's golden era began in the late 8th century and lasted until the early 11th century during which time it played an important role in Jewish history, having been a world center of Talmudic and Halakhic scholarship for at least three generations. The Banu Hilal conquest of Kairouan in 1057 led to the decline of the medieval community with Jews only returning after Tunisia was established as a French protectorate in 1881. By the 1960s the community had disappeared, and all that remains is their dilapidated cemetery.\n\nMain sights\nGreat Mosque of Kairouan\nThe city's main landmark is the Great Mosque of Sidi-Uqba (also known as the Great Mosque of Kairouan) which is one of the most impressive and largest Islamic monuments in North Africa. Originally built when Kairouan was founded in 670 AD, the mosque currently occupies an area of over 9,000 square metres (97,000 sq ft) and is one of the oldest places of worship in the Islamic world. The mosque became a center of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences and helped the city to develop and expand.\n\nMosque of the Three Doors\nThe Mosque of the Three Doors was founded in 866. Its façade is a notable example of Islamic architecture. It has three arched doorways surmounted by three inscriptions in Kufic script, interspersed with floral and geometrical reliefs and topped by a carved frieze; the first inscription includes the verses 70–71 in the sura 33 of Quran. The small minaret was added during the restoration works held under the Hafsid dynasty. The prayer hall has a nave and two aisles, divided by arched columns, parallel to the qibla wall.\n\nMosque of the Barber\nThe Zawiya of Sidi Sahib, also known as the Mosque of the Barber, is a religious complex containing the mausoleum of Abu Zama' al-Balawi, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who, according to legend, had saved for himself three hairs of Muhammad's beard, hence the edifice's name. The complex was first built up in the 14th century under the Hafsids, but in its present state it dates from the 17th century, under the Muradids. The tomb chamber is accessed from a cloister-like court with rich tile and stucco decoration. In addition to the mausoleum, the complex includes a madrasa and several other facilities.\n\nAghlabid basins\nThe Aghlabid basins are a Tunisian historical monument located in Kairouan. Dating from the 9th century and located outside the ramparts of the medina of Kairouan, they are considered to be the most important hydraulic systems in the history of the Muslim world. The structure covers an area of 11,000 square meters and consists of a small settling basin, a large basin for storing water and two drawing tanks, all having a total storage capacity of 68,800 cubic meters.\n\nEconomy\nThe primary economic sectors in Kairouan are industry, agriculture and tourism.\n\nIndustry\nThe Kairouan region currently has 167 industrial companies offering more than 10,000 jobs, of which 33 are fully exporters.\nThe industrial activities of the region are quite diversified, although the agrifood industry sector is preeminent with 91 units.\n\nAgriculture\nThe governorate of Kairouan is known mainly for the production of vegetables (peppers, tomatoes) and fruits (apricots, almonds and olives). It is the leading national producer of chili peppers with nearly 90,000 tonnes in 2019, as well as apricots with more than 15,000 tonnes.\n\nTourism\nKairouan is one of the four most visited sites in Tunisia along with Carthage, El Jem and Le Bardo as historic sites. Tourist activity is focused on the historic sites and monuments of the city of Kairouan.\n\nFood\nKairouan is known for its pastries (e.g. zlebia and makroudh).\n\nIn popular culture\nKairouan was used as a filming location for the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark, standing in for Cairo. As the film is set in 1936, television antennas throughout the city were taken down for the duration of filming.\n\nNotable people\nSu'da – historically attested Berber princess supposedly died there.\nNajla Bouden – 17th Prime Minister of Tunisia (first female prime minister in the Arab world).\nHabib Galhia, boxer\nHabiba Ghribi, athlete\nFatima al-Fihriya, founder of the first university in the world.\nSalih al-Souissi al-Qayrawani (1871–1941), writer and activist\n\nTwin towns\nGallery\nSee also\nKairouan's significance in Islam\nList of mosques in Kairouan\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nKairouan, tourismtunisia.com\nKairouan World heritage Site, whc.unesco.org\nKairouan University\nAl-Qayrawan, muslimheritage.com\nKairwan, jewishencyclopedia.com\nWorldStatesmen-Tunisia\nKAIROUAN, The Capital of Islamic Culture \nPanoramic virtual tour of Kairouan medina Archived 30 July 2021 at the Wayback Machine",

      "content": "القَيْرَوَان ( او )، مدينه تونسيه، تبعد حوالي 160 كيلومتر عن تونس العاصمه والقيروان المعروفه بعاصمه الاغالبه هي اول المدن الاسلاميه المشيده في بلاد المغرب وكان لها دور استراتيجي في الفتح الاسلامي، انطلقت منها حملات الفتح نحو الجزائر والمغرب واسبانيا وافريقيا بالاضافه الى انها رقاد لعدد من صحابه رسول الله محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم ويطلق عليها الفقهاء «رابعه الثلاث،» بعد مكه والمدينه المنوره والقدس وفي هذه المدينه توجد اهم المعالم للقيروان، منها جامع القيروان الكبير و الذي اسسه عقبه بن نافع.\n\nتاريخ القيروان\nيعود تاريخ القيروان الى عام 50 هـ / 670 م، عندما قام بانشائها عقبه بن نافع. وكان هدفه من هذا البناء ان يستقر به المسلمون، اذ كان يخشى ان رجع المسلمون عن اهل افريقيه ان يعودوا الى دينهم. وتعتبر القيروان من اقدم واهم المدن الاسلاميه، بل هي المدينه الاسلاميه الاولى في منطقه المغرب الاسلامي ويعتبر انشاء مدينه القيروان بدايه تاريخ الحضاره العربيه الاسلاميه في المغرب العربي، فلقد كانت مدينه القيروان تلعب دورين هامين في ان واحد، هما: الجهاد والدعوه، فبينما كانت الجيوش تخرج منها للغزو والتوسعات، كان الفقهاء يخرجون منها لينتشروا بين البلاد يعلِّمون العربيه وينشرون الاسلام. فهي بذلك تحمل في كلّ شبر من ارضها عطر مجد شامخ وارثا عريقا يؤكده تاريخها الزّاهر ومعالمها الباقيه التي تمثل مراحل هامه من التاريخ العربي الاسلامي. لقد بقيت القيروان حوالي اربعه قرون عاصمه الاسلام الاولى لافريقيه والاندلس ومركزا حربيّا للجيوش الاسلاميه ونقطه ارتكاز رئيسيه لاشاعه اللغه العربيه. وعندما تذكر القيروان يذكر القائد العربي الكبير عقبه بن نافع وقولته المشهوره عندما بلغ في توسعاته المحيط الاطلسي وهو يرفع يده الى السماء ويصرخ باعلى صوته : «اللهم اشهد اني بلغت المجهول ولولا هذا البحر لمضيت في البلاد اقاتل من كفر بك حتى لا يعبد احد من دونك». تقع القيروان في تونس على بُعد 160 كم من العاصمه تونس. وكلمه القيروان كلمه فارسيه دخلت الى العربيه، وتعني مكان السلاح ومحط الجيش او استراحه القافله وموضع اجتماع الناس في الحرب..\n\nاصل التسميه\nيرجع اصل كلمه «القيروان» الى كلمه «کاروان» الفارسيه، والتي تعني الرَّتْل العسكري او القافله. وهي نفسها الكلمه التي اعطت «caravane» الفرنسيه.\n\nاختيار موقع القيروان\nاجتمع عقبه بن نافع بعد انتهائه من بناء مدينه القيروان بوجود اصحابه واهل العسكر فدار بهم حول مدينه القيروان، واقبل يدعو لها ويقول في دعائه: اللهم املاها علما وفقها، واعمرها بالمطيعين والعابدين، واجعلها عزا لدينك وذلا لمن كفر بك، واعز بها الاسلام.\nفلما ارسى عقبه بن نافع قواعد مدينته الجديده، لم يكن يدري وهو يدعو ربّه ليمنعها من جبابره الارض ويملاها فقهاً وعلماً ويجعلها عزّاً للاسلام ايّ مصير تخبِّئه لها الايام، الا انه استراتيجياً كان موفَّقاً في اختياره، فالقيروان توجد على مسيره يوم من البحر الذي كان البيزنطيون يسيطرون على عبابه، وهي تبعد بمثل ذلك عن الجبال، حيث كانت انذاك تعتصم القبائل البربريه المناوئه للاسلام، وتمثل القاعده المحدثه راس الحربه وسط خط المواجهه المتخذ بين المسلمين والبيزنطيين، بعد انهزام ملكهم جرجير في سبيطله امام جيوش معاويه بن حديج سنه 45 هـ، 665 م وتراجع سلطانهم وانحصاره في شمال البلاد.\nبجانب ذلك فالقيروان في منبسط من الارض مديد يسمح باستنفار الفرسان في غير صعوبه، وقد كانت الخيل قوام جيش المسلمين في جُلّ معاركهم وحروبهم المصيريه، وقد راعى عقبه في اختياره لموقع مدينته الجديده تقريبها من السبخه حتى يوفّر ما تحتاجه الابل من المراعي، وتسميه القيروان تستجيب للغرض الاصلي من تاسيسها فهي كلمه معرَّبه عن اللغه الفارسيه وتعني المعسكر او القافله او محط اثقال الجيش.\nولا ريب ان مختلف الحملات والغزوات التي سبقت بناء القيروان كانت تمر بالموقع، وتتّفق المصادر على ان معاويه بن حديج قد عسكر خلال احدى حملاته الثلاث على افريقيّه بالموضع المعروف بالقرن على بعد عشره كيلومترات شمال غربي القيروان، كما تذكر كتب الطبقات ان الصحابي ابا زمعه البلوي قد استشهد خلال غزوه معاويه بن حديج الاولى العام 34 هـ، 654 م وهو محاصر لجلوله، فاُخذ ودُفن بموضع القيروان\n\nالمكانه العلميه للقيروان\nكانت القيروان اولى المراكز العلميه في المغرب العربي تليها قرطبه في الاندلس ثم فاس في المغرب الاقصى ولقد قصدها ابناء المغرب وغيرها من البلاد المجاوره. وكان مسجد عقبه الجامع ومعه بقيه مساجد القيروان تعقد فيه حلقات للتدريس وانشئت مدارس جامعه اطلقوا عليها (دور الحكمه). واستقدم لها العلماء والفقهاء ورجال الدعوه من الشرق فكانت هذه المدارس وما اقترن به انشاؤها من انصراف القائمين عليها للدرس والبحث عاملا في رفع شان لغه القران لغه العرب وثقافتهم.\nولقد كان للقيروان دور كبير في نشر وتعليم الدين وعلومه بحكم ما علق على هذه المدينه من امال في هدايه الناس وجلبهم الى افريقيه وهي نقطه هامه لاحظها الفاتحون منذ ان استقر رايهم على انشاء مدينه القيروان، فعندما عزم عقبه بن نافع ومن معه على وضع محراب المسجد الجامع فكروا كثيرا في متجه القبله، وراقبوا طلوع الشمس وغروبها عده ايام. وقال له اصحابه:\n\nواصبح محراب القيروان اسوه وقدوه لبقيه مساجد المغرب الاسلامي بمعناه الواسع حتى ان محمد بن حارث الخشني بعد ان قدم من القيروان الى سبته وشاهد انحراف مسجدها عن قبله الصلاه عدله وصوبه.\nوفي عهد الخليفه الاموي عمر بن عبد العزيز (99-101 هـ / 717 -720م) اراد تثقيف اهل المغرب وتعليمهم امر دينهم فجعل من مدينه القيروان مركزا للبعثه العلميه المكونه من عشره اشخاص من التابعين فارسلهم الى افريقيه حيث انقطعوا الى تعليم السكان امور الدين، ومات غالب افراد البعثه في مدينه القيروان نفسها.\nوهكذا اصبحت مدينه القيروان مركزا للعلم في المغرب الاسلامي حتى كانت مفخره المغرب. ومنها خرجت علوم المذهب المالكي، والى ائمتها كل عالم ينتسب وكان قاضي القيروان يمثل اعلى منصب ديني في عموم البلاد المغربيه، واليه المرجع في تسميه قضاه مختلف الجهات.\nو اسهمت القيروان في عهد الاغالبه في نشر المذهب المالكي في ارجاء الدوله الاغلبيه، ومنها انتشر في صقليه والاندلس. وقد تم ذلك على يد الامام سحنون (160-240 هـ / 777 -855م)، واقرانه وتلاميذه. فهؤلاء كانوا يلتزمون المذهب المالكي، اذ انهم كانوا يذهبون لاداء فريضه الحج، ثم يلزمون الامام مالك بن انس في المدينه المنوره، فتاثروا بفقهه. وقد ولي سحنون قضاء القيروان (234-240 هـ / 848 -854 م)، فكان صاحب النفوذ الاكبر لا في شئون القضاء فحسب، بل في جميع شئون الدوله. ولما عاد سحنون من المدينه المنوره كان قد وضع اسس الكتاب الذي دونه ويسمى المدونه التي اصبحت قاعده التدريس في المغرب الادنى، ومن هناك انتقلت الى الاندلس. وكانت الكتب الفقهيه التي الفها علماء القيروان ابتداء من كتاب المدونه لصاحبه الفقيه الكبير سحنون والذي اصبح مرجعا دينيا لرجال القيروان، الى رساله ابن ابي زيد ونوادره وزياداته الى تهذيب ابي سعيد البراذعي، كانت هذه الكتب وامثالها عمده الدارسين والشراح والمعلقين لا يعرفون غيرها الى المائه السابعه من التاريخ الهجري عندما ابتدات كتب المشارقه تاتي الى المغرب مثل مختصر ابن الحاجب ومختصر خليل فيما بعد.\n\nبيت الحكمه\nانشئت في القيروان المكتبات العامه والمكتبات الملحقه بالجوامع والمدارس والزوايا وكانت مفتوحه للدارسين وتضم نفائس امهات الكتب. ومن اشهر مكتبات القيروان بيت الحكمه الذي انشاه ابراهيم الثاني 261-289 هـ / 875 -902 م. في رقاده بالقيروان محاكاه لبيت الحكمه التي اسسها هارون الرشيد في بغداد حيث كانت هذه البيت نواه لمدرسه الطب القيروانيه التي اثرت في الحركه العلميه في المغرب لزمن طويل.\nوقد استقدم ابراهيم بن احمد الاغلبي اعدادا كبيره من علماء الفلك والطب والنبات والهندسه والرياضيات من المشرق والمغرب وزوده بالالات الفلكيه. وكان ابراهيم بن احمد يبعث كل عام (واحيانا كل سته اشهر) بعثه الى بغداد هدفها تجديد ولائه للخلافه العباسيه واقتناء نفائس الكتب المشرقيه في الحكمه والفلك مما لا نظير له في المغرب واستقدام مشاهير العلماء في العراق ومصر. وعلى هذا النحو امكنه في امد قصير ان يقيم في رقاده نموذجا مصغرا من بيت الحكمه في بغداد، ولم يلبث هذا البيت ان وقع في ايدي الفاطميين بعد سنوات معدوده من وفاته.\nولقد كان بيت الحكمه معهدا علميا للدرس والبحث العلمي والترجمه من اللاتينيه، ومركزا لنسخ المصنفات، وكان يتولى الاشراف عليه حفظه مهمتهم السهر على حراسه ما يحتويه من كتب، وتزويد الباحثين والمترددين عليه من طلاب العلم بما يلزمهم من هذه الكتب حسب تخصصاتهم، ويراس هؤلاء الحفظه ناظر كان يعرف بصاحب بيت الحكمه.\nواول من تولى هذا المنصب عالم الرياضيات ابو اليسر ابراهيم بن محمد الشيباني الكاتب المعروف بابي اليسر الرياضي، وهو بغدادي النشاه، حيث اتيح له ان يلتقي بالعديد من المحدثين والفقهاء والادباء واللغويين. وكان قد تنقل في اقطار المشرق قبل انتقاله الى الاندلس واخيرا استقر بالقيروان.\nوكان الامير ابراهيم بن احمد يعقد المجالس العلميه للمناظره في بيت الحكمه، وكان يحضر هذه المجالس العلماء البارزون من فقهاء المالكيه والحنفيه.\n\nالمساجد\nيعد مسجد القيروان الذي بناه عقبه بن نافع عند انشاء المدينه من اهم معالمها عبر التاريخ. ولقد بدا المسجد صغير المساحه، بسيط البناء، ولكن لم يمض على بنائه عشرون عاما حتى هدمه حسان بن نعمان الغساني واقام مكانه مسجدا جديدا اكبر من الاول. وفي عهد الخليفه هشام بن عبد الملك امر بزياده مساحته، واضاف اليه حديقه كبيره في شماله، وجعل له صهريجا للمياه، وشيد ماذنه.\nوفي عام 155 هـ / 724 م اعيد بناؤه على يد يزيد بن حاتم، وظل على حاله هذه الى ان تولى\nزياده الله بن ابراهيم بن الاغلب اماره افريقيه عام 201 هـ / 817 م فزاد فيه. ولقد سارت التوسعات في العصور المختلفه حتى اصبح يشغل اليوم مساحه مستطيله تتراوح اضلاعها ما بين (70 و122) مترا.\nويعتبر جامع القيروان من اقدم مساجد المغرب الاسلامي والمصدر الاول الذي اقتبست منه العماره المغربيه والاندلسيه عناصرها الزخرفيه والمعماريه. كما كان هذا المسجد ميدانا للحلقات الدينيه والعلميه واللغويه التي ضمت نخبه من اكبر علماء ذلك العصر.\n\nمن اعلام القيروان\nلقد تميّز كل عصر من عصور القيروان بعدد وافر من الاسماء والاعلام في شتى ضروب العلم والمعرفه لمّْا كانت عاصمه المغرب العربي واعظم مدن القاره الافريقيه ومناره عاليه للاشعاع الفكري والديني والحضاري في عصور الاغالبه والفاطميين والصنهاجيين. ومن هؤلاء الاعلام الامام سحنون وابن رشيق القيرواني وابن شرف واسد بن الفرات وابن الجزار.\nلكن المهتمين بالتاريخ يذكرون خصوصا اسم المعزّ بن باديس الصنهاجي كاكبر رمز لما بلغته القيروان من حضاره في عهد الصنهاجيين وعبد الله بن الاغلب الذي جعل من القيروان اسما ملا الدنيا، اما عقبه بن نافع فانه يظل الفاتح والمؤسس.\nكان من اوائل من قام بالتعليم في مدينه القيروان اولئك العشره من التابعين الذين ارسلهم عمر بن عبد العزيز ليعلموا الناس وكان من اشهر اولئك العشره اسماعيل بن عبيد الله بن ابي المهاجر الذي كان -بالاضافه الى انه عامل للخليفه- من اكثر افراد تلك البعثه اندفاعا في نشر الدين وادخال البربر الى الاسلام.\nوكان منهم عبد الله بن يزيد الحُبُلي الذي شهد الاستيلاء على الاندلس مع موسى بن نصير، ثم عاد الى القيروان ومات فيها.\nومنهم ايضا اسماعيل بن عبيد المشهور بلقب «تاجر الله» وهو الذي بنى المسجد المعروف باسم مسجد الزيتونه، كما بنى سوقا للتجاره عرفت باسم سوق اسماعيل. وقد استشهد غريقا في احدى الغزوات البحريه لصقليه سنه 107 هـ / 726 م، ومنهم عبد الرحمن بن رافع التنوخي اول من تولى القضاء بمدينه القيروان.\nواما رواد الفقه في القيروان فهم كثير منهم الامام سحنون بن سعيد الفقيه صاحب ابي القاسم - تلميذ الامام مالك - ومؤلف كتاب المدونه والذي كان له دور كبير في تدوين المذهب المالكي، وقد حضر دروس هذا الفقيه العديد من طلاب الاندلس الذين قاموا بنشر مذهبه فيما بعد.\nوقد عرفت من رجال الفقه كذلك اسد بن الفرات قاضي افريقيه في عهد الاغالبه وقائد الحمله الى صقليه وفاتح الجزيره ومحمد ابن الامام سحنون بن سعيد وابن ابي زيد القيرواني.\nكما اشتهر فيها من الشعراء: ابو عبد الله القزاز القيرواني، والحسين بن رشيق القيرواني، وابن هانئ الاندلسي.\nوكان من بين علمائها عبد الكريم النهشلي عالم اللغه وكان من اهل الادب ابو اسحاق (الحصري) القيرواني صاحب زهر الاداب.\nاما عن مدرسه الطب فقد اشتهرت منها اسره ابن الجزار التي توارثت الطب ابا عن جد.\n\nدورها\nلعبت مدينه القيروان دورا رئيسيا في القرون الاسلاميه الاولى، فكانت العاصمه السياسيه للمغرب الاسلامي ومركز الثقل فيه منذ ابتداء الفتح الى اخر دوله الامويين بدمشق. وعندما تاسست الخلافه العباسيه ببغداد رات فيها عاصمه العباسيين خير مساند لها لما اصبح يهدد الدوله الناشئه من خطر الانقسام والتفكك. ومع ظهور عده دول مناوئه للعاصمه العباسيه في المغرب الاسلامي فقد نشات دوله الامويين بالاندلس، ونشات الدوله الرستميه في الجزائر، ونشات الدوله الادريسيه العلويه في المغرب الاقصى.\nوكانت كل دوله من تلك الدول تحمل عداوه لبني العباس خاصه الدوله الادريسيه الشيعيه التي تعتبرها بغداد اكبر خطر يهددها. لهذا كله راى هارون الرشيد ان يتخذ سدا منيعا يحول دون تسرب الخطر الشيعي. ولم ير الا عاصمه افريقيه قادره على ذلك، فاعطى لابراهيم بن الاغلب الاستقلال في النفوذ وتسلسل الاماره في نسله.\nوقامت دوله الاغالبه (184-296هـ / 800 -909م) كوحده مستقله ومدافعه عن الخلافه. وقد كانت دوله الاغالبه هذا الدرع المنيع ايام استقرارها، ونجحت في ضم صقليه الى ملكها عام 264 هـ / 878 م، وقام امراؤها الاوائل باعمال بنائيه ضخمه في القيروان ذاتها ومنها توسيع الجامع في القيروان، وتوسيع الجامع في تونس، كما عمل الاغالبه على الاهتمام بالزراعه والري في المنطقه، واقاموا الفسقيه المشهوره.\nوقد استغل الامراء الاغالبه تلك المكانه واتخذوها سلاحا يهددون به عاصمه بغداد كلما هم خليفه من خلفائها بالتقليل من شان الامراء الاغالبه او انتقاص سيادتهم. وهذا ما فعله زياده الله بن الاغلب مع الخليفه المامون العباسي. فقد اراد هذا الاخير الحاق القيراون بولايه مصر، وطلب من زياده الله ان يدعو لعبد الله بن طاهر بن الحسين والي المامون على مصر فادخل زياده الله رسول المامون اليه، وقال له: ان الخليفه يامرني بالدعاء لعبد خزاعه. هذا لا يكون ابدا ثم مد يده الى كيس بجنبه فيه الف دينار ودفعه للرسول. وكان في الكيس دنانير مضروبه باسم الادارسه في المغرب ؛ ففهم المامون مقصد الامير الاغلبي فكف عن محاولته ولم يعد اليها.\nوبسبب هذه المكانه فقد عمل على التقرب منها اكبر ملك في اوروبا اذ بعث الامبراطور شارلمان بسفرائه الى ابراهيم بن الاغلب فقابلهم في دار الاماره بالعباسيه في ابهه عجيبه بالرغم من الصلات الوديه التي كانت بين هذا الامبراطور والخليفه العباسي هارون الرشيد.\nوفي عهد ولايه ابراهيم بن احمد بن محمد بن الاغلب (261 - 289 هـ / 875 -902 م) بدات الفتن تدب بين امراء الاغالبه. وكان ابراهيم بن احمد سفاحا لم تسلم منه عامه الناس ولا اقرب الناس اليه وكان غدره بسبعمائه من اهل بلزمه سنه 280 هـ / 894 م سببا من اسباب سقوط دوله بني الاغلب. وفي نفس السنه شقت عصا الطاعه في وجه هذا الامير مدن تونس، وباجه، وقموده، وغيرها. وعمت الفوضى ارجاء البلاد بينما الخطر العبيدي الشيعي يزداد يوما بعد يوم. ولما ايقن ابراهيم بن احمد بخطر بني عبيد حاول سنه 289 هـ /902 م تغيير سياسته، فرفع المظالم، واستمال الفقهاء، وبذل الاموال للشعب ولكن بدون جدوى. وفي عهد حفيده زياده الله ازداد خوف بغداد واشتد جزعها من الزحف العبيدي فبعث الخليفه العباسي المكتفي بالله يحث اهل افريقيه على نصره زياده الله فلم يكن لذلك صدى في النفوس وبذل زياده الله الاموال بلا حساب ولكن دون جدوى. فلم يمض على هذا الحادث سوى ثلاث سنوات حتى جاءت معركه الاربس الحاسمه سنه 296 هـ / 909 م وفر على اثرها زياده الله الى\nالمشرق ومعه وجوه رجاله وفتيانه وعبيده. وباستيلاء العبيديين على القيروان جمعوا كل المغرب تحت سيطرتهم فشجعهم ذلك على متابعه السير نحو المشرق. وامكن لهم فيما بعد ان يستولوا على مصر والشام والحجاز. ولولا الظروف السياسيه والوضع الداخلي للفاطميين لاستولوا على بغداد نفسها.\n\nوعندما انتقل بنو عبيد الى مصر ووصل المعز لدين الله الفاطمي القاهره عام 362 هـ / 973 م اهتموا بالقيروان واتخذوها مركزا لنائبهم في افريقيه، وعهدوا اليه بالسهر على حفظ وحده المغرب والسيطره عليه. واستخلف المعز الفاطمي بلكين بن زيري الصنهاجي على افريقيه، وكتب الى العمال وولاه الاشغال بالسمع والطاعه له فاصبح اميرا على افريقيه والمغرب كله، وقام بلكين وخلفاؤه بقمع الثورات التي حصلت خاصه في المغرب في قبائل زناته.\nواستمر المغرب في وحدته الصنهاجيه وتبعيته الى مصر الفاطميه الى ان انقسم البيت الصنهاجي على نفسه فاستقل حماد الصنهاجي عن القيروان متخذا من القلعه التي بناها قاعده لامارته. وكان هذا الانقسام السياسي خير ممهد لظهور دوله المرابطين في المغرب الاقصى. كما كان لهذا الانقسام نتائجه الاليمه فيما بعد عندما اعلن المعز ابن باديس الصنهاجي استقلاله عن الفاطميين، فبعثوا اليه بقبائل الاعراب من الهلاليين فمزق شمل الدوله، وقضى على معالم الحضاره، وخربت القيروان، ولم تعد العاصمه السياسيه القويه او مركزا تشع منه المعارف والعلوم والاداب.\nالشيخ عبد الرحمن خليف (27 ماي 1917 - 19 فيفري 2006)\n\nالمدينه الحديثه\nاحدى اهم المدن التونسيه ومقر الولايه (117.903 الف نسمه، عام 2004).
