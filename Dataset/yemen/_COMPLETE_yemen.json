          "content": "The Great Mosque of Sana'a (Arabic: الجامع الكبير بصنعاء‎, al-Jāmiʿ al-Kabīr bi-Ṣanʿāʾ) is an ancient mosque in Sana'a, Yemen, and one of the oldest mosques in the world. The mosque is said to have been founded in the early Islamic period, suggested to be in 633. While the precise date of construction is unknown, the earliest recorded renovations occurred under Caliph al-Walid I in the early 8th century, implying a possible earlier date of construction. The mosque was reportedly built in part from spolia from the Himyarite-era Ghumdan Palace and from the Axumite Christian Church of al-Qalis that formerly occupied the site. The Great Mosque is the largest and most notable of over one hundred mosques in the Old City of Sana’a.\nThe building has undergone renovations in the 8th century, the 13th century, and during the Ottoman period. An important archaeological find was the Sana'a manuscript, discovered there during restoration in 1972. Today, the Great Mosque of Sana’a is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Old City of Sana'a.\n\nLocation\nThe city of Sana'a was the military center of the pre-Islamic kingdom of the Sabeans and was an important center for the Himyarite Kingdom. The mosque, commissioned by Muhammad, who instructed for its construction within the garden of the Persian governors, was built upon the ruins of Sheba's Ghumdan Palace, between the two areas of Sana'a at the time: al-Qati and al-Sirar. The Great mosque was built near the suq, which was already in place at the time of its construction.\nIn later years, city planning, expansion, and orientation were greatly influenced by the construction of the Great Mosque and two other mosques on the city's north side.\n\nHistory\nAround 630 CE (6 AH), according to early Islamic sources, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was said to have commanded the construction of the Great Mosque of Sana’a, and the mosque is known as the first mosque to have been built outside of the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. During this post-Hijra period (622-632 CE), Sana'a was central in the propagation of the Islamic religion. Many of the archaeological finds discovered in the Great Mosque substantiate an argument for its construction to the era when Muhammad was alive, including several spolia from the Axumite Cathedral as well as from the Sabaean Ghumdan Palace. During the 7th century, the remains of pre-Islamic Sana'a were largely destroyed when it became the center for the spread of the Islamic faith during the early years of the Hijrah. This is evidenced by the architectural remains of pre-Islamic buildings found within the Great Mosque.\nFrom 705 to 715 (86–96 AH), the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I expanded the mosque. An inscription found in the courtyard of the mosque dates to 753 CE,  in the Abbasid period.\nIn 876/7 CE, floods twice caused substantial damage to the mosque, after which it was renovated.\nIn the early 9th century, a minaret was constructed on the east side. In the year 911 CE, Karmatis invaded the city, damaging the mosque.\nIn the twelfth century, 1130 CE, the Isma`ili Queen Arwa al-Sulayhi restored much of the mosque. She was responsible for the sculpted ceilings of the mosque's eastern, western, and northern wings. The mosque's western minaret was built as a part of this restoration.\nIn the early 16th century, the mosque was renovated with a domed square structure and the paving of its courtyard.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Great Mosque is built in a style of stepped stone, which is linked to similar ancient Abyssinian Axumite stonework. The wooden ceilings, made of lacunari's wood, are carved and painted.\n\nThe central courtyard measures 80 by 60 metres (260 ft × 200 ft), with prayer halls arranged in a north–south direction. Halls with three aisles aligned along the east–west direction are built with materials of the pre-Islamic period brought from other areas. Within the courtyard is a domed structure dating back to the 16th century. It is an Ottoman building that resembles the Ka'ba in Mecca, however, it is argued that the two are not connected due to the alternating layers of colored materials, which is an ablaq technique, predating Islam within the region. This structure first served as the mosque's treasury, and later as a storage place for waqf and has a large library and other ancient manuscripts. This structure may originally have had a water feature such as an ablution pool beneath it for those wishing to purify themselves when visiting the mosque.The interior stone arcades of the flat roofs of the mosque are suggested to be Byzantine architectural features of the Axumite Empire. This is evidenced by the fact that the Axumite Empire erected its largest cathedral within the city of Sana'a and that remains of this cathedral, as well as from Gumdan palace and Christian and Jewish places of worship, are incorporated into the Great Mosque. Further evidence of this relation is an inscription in the pre-Islamic language of the region, Sabaic, in a reused stone arch support implies it is connected to Byzantine architecture.The western minaret, built during Queen Arwa bint Ahmad's restoration, is similar to those of the mosques of the same period built in Cairo, due to her close links with the Fatimid dynasty in Egypt.\n\nDiscoveries\nIn 1972–73, when plaster was removed by archaeologists, they discovered some 65 artifacts, including large quantities of old manuscripts and parchments, as well as the Sana'a manuscript, found by construction workers while renovating an attic wall. Four thousand rare Arabic manuscripts were also uncovered that are linked to the start of Islam, the Umayyad period, and Sheba's Palace of Ghamdan and its destruction. One of the Koran found here is said to have been written or compiled by Imam Ali, which is preserved by the mosque library. Early book bindings found at the mosque have been well documented by scholars such as Ursula Dreibholz (1997).\nOther archaeological finds at the Great Mosque are remnants of vaults and old buildings connected to the capital when it contained the Axumite Church of al-Qalis, unearthed in 2006.\n\nPreservation\nThe Great Mosque is included on the UNESCO World Heritage Site List, designated in 1986 as list no. 345, under Criteria: (iv)(v)(vi), which includes 103 mosques, 14 hammams, and over 6,000 houses of Sana'a, all built before the eleventh century. Preservation of the Great Mosque, which is of exceptional religious and historical value, has been supported by UNESCO's World Heritage Institute of Training and Research-Asia and Pacific (Shanghai). Analysis of the damage suffered by the mosque over several centuries includes evidence of floods, rains, soil subsidence, old electrical wiring and connections, groundwater seepage, vandalism, and wars, and also weak old buildings adjoining the mosque.\nRepairs and maintenance, initiated in 2003, continue to be carried out in phases, such as electrical system renovation. Plastering has been redone, including restoration of the old traditional plaster known as qudad. Pavings have been improved and minarets are being restored. Improvements have been made in ablution areas and modern toilets were added. Other improvements have been made to the water supply and sewerage systems, as well as the removal of old buildings that do not match the historical and architectural features of the mosque.\n\nSee also\nList of mosques in Yemen\nList of mosques in Sanaa\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\n\nLewcock, Ronald; Smith, G.

          "content": "The Dar al-Hajar (Arabic: دار الحجر, \"Stone House\" or \"Rock Palace\") is a former royal palace located in Wadi Dhar about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Sanaa, Yemen.  Built in 1920 as the summer retreat of Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din, Imam of Yemen from 1904 to 1948, it sits on top of a structure built in 1786 for the scholar al-Imam Mansour.  The royal family resided in the palace until the North Yemen Civil War.  The palace is currently a museum.\n\nHistory\nThe construction of the palace dates back to the late 18th century when the Imam of Yemen, Al-Mansur Ali bin Abbas, ordered his minister Ali bin Saleh Al-Amari (1736-1798), who was renowned for his expertise in architecture, astronomy, poetry, and literature, to build a summer palace for him in Wadi Dhahr. Historians narrate that it was built on the ruins of an ancient Sabaean palace known as the Fortress of Dhi Saydan, constructed by the Himyarites in 3000 B.C. The fortress was destroyed by the Turks four hundred years ago and was restored in the early 20th century by Imam Yahya Hamid al-Din after being passed down through several Yemeni Imams. It is currently a tourist attraction regularly visited by locals and foreigners. The construction remained in its initial form for years until Imam Yahya bin Hamid al-Din added the upper floor (the Mafraj).\nThe accounts regarding the founding and construction of Dar Al-Hajar vary. Some stories suggest that the palace was destroyed dozens of times but was always rebuilt. It is said that during their first invasion of Yemen, the Turks preferred to reside in this palace because of its unique architectural style and the valley, which, along with other surrounding sites and landscapes, forms a garden and orchard for the residents and visitors of this historical palace. These places are known for their perennial greenery, with the valley being famous for growing grapes, peaches, and quinces, in addition to the giant doum palm trees, which have begun to disappear due to the expansion of qat cultivation. It is also said that during Turkish rule, the country experienced heavy rains that led to the palace's collapse, leaving no trace of it.\nSubsequently, Imam Abdullah Al-Mansur came to the area and rebuilt the three floors using black basalt stone, which is the structure that exists today. He then lived there, and after his death, Imam Al-Nasir resided in the palace. It is said that during his rule, there were some wars and conflicts between him and the people of Hamdan, who killed him while he was asleep. They took his body and buried him, along with his guards, in an area south of Wadi Dahr. The locals say that his grave still exists and is known to everyone.\nAfter the death of Imam Al-Nasir, the imams were apprehensive about residing in this palace. Imam Yahya even built some other palaces in the valley. However, he soon changed his mind and decided to restore Dar Al-Hajar, adding several additional floors using fired bricks and incorporating other facilities such as the Mafraj, where he would receive people. The Imam also constructed a mosque adjacent to the palace and inscribed on its door \"Built for God by Al-Mutawakkil ala Allah\", which remains there to this day.\n\nArchitectural style\nThe palace consists of seven floors that are designed to align with the natural formation of the rock (the foundation of the structure). At its entrance, there is an ancient talouqa tree estimated to be 700 years old. The entry to the palace is through a wide passage paved with large stones, leading to a rest area. The Mafraj is located on the northern side, overlooking a circular water basin constructed from black basalt stone.\n\nIn popular culture\nIn 1974, Pier Paolo Pasolini used the palace as the home of Princess Dunya in his film The Arabian Nights.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nDar al-Bashair\nDar as-Sa'd\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Dar al-Hajar at Wikimedia Commons",

          "content": "Shibam (Arabic: شِبَام, romanized: Shibām), officially the Old Walled City of Shibam (Arabic: مدينة شبام القديمة وسورها), is a town in Wadi Hadhramaut in eastern Yemen with about 7,000 inhabitants. It is the seat of the Shibam District in the Hadhramaut Governorate. It is known for its mudbrick-made high-rise buildings, with some of the buildings reaching as high as 11 stories. The design centred around protecting the residents of the city from Bedouin attacks.\nThe city was founded around the 3rd century and became the capital of the Kingdom of Hadhramaut in 300 AD. Its strategic location along ancient trade routes contributed to its prosperity. Shibam has been continuously inhabited for an estimated 1,700 years. In 1982, Shibam was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its unique architecture and cultural significance. It is sometimes informally referred to as the \"Manhattan of the Desert\" (مَانْهَاتَن ٱلصَّحْرَاء) or \"Chicago of the Desert\" (شِيْكَاغو ٱلصَّحْرَاء).\n\nHistory\nThe first known inscription about the city dates from the 3rd century CE. According to al-Hamdani, the origins of the city of Shibam date back to the pre-Islamic period, when the town rose to prominence until it became the capital of the Kingdom of Hadhramaut in 300 AD, after the destruction of its previous capital, Shabwa, located in the far west of the Hadhramaut Valley. It is not clear whether the current city is standing where the ancient city stood, a theory suggests that the city's rise of more than 6 meters from the surrounding floor plain might be because of the accumilation of ruins over a long period of time, although there hasn't been any archaeological excavations that back this theory up and it might be a natural outcrop of the mountain spur behind it.\nThere are two major archaeological sites near Shibam: Jujah and Gabusa. Jujah used to be a quarry for large squared building stones. Gabusa was the site of an Assyrian-style bronze lion's head.\nIn the 20th century, it was one of the three major cities of the Qu'aiti Sultanate, the others being Mukalla and Ash-Shihr.\nThe city was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1982.\nThe 2008 Yemen cyclone flooded Shibam causing some of the buildings to collapse.\nDuring the Yemen Civil War, the city suffered some damage after insurgents detonated a car bomb. There was also coalition bombing in the area. In 2015, UNESCO listed the city, along with Old Sana'a, as \"cultural heritage at risk\".\n\nCulture\nArchitecture\nShibam, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is known for its distinct architecture. The houses of Shibam are all made out of mudbrick, and about 500 of them are tower blocks, which rise 5 to 11 stories high, with each floor having one or two rooms. This architectural style was used in order to protect residents from Bedouin attacks. While Shibam has been in existence for an estimated 1,700 years, the present town dates to 1533. Many houses, though, have been rebuilt numerous times in the last few centuries.\nShibam is often called \"the oldest skyscraper city in the world\". It is one of the oldest and best examples of urban planning based on the principle of vertical construction. The city has some of the tallest mud buildings in the world, with some of them over 30 m (98 feet) high, thus being early high-rise apartment buildings. In order to protect the buildings from rain and erosion, the walls must be routinely maintained by applying fresh layers of mud. The city is surrounded by a fortified wall, giving it the name \"the walled city of Shibam\".\n\nThreats\nThe mudbrick buildings are frequently threatened by wind, rain, and heat erosion, and require constant upkeep in order to maintain their structures. The city was heavily affected by flooding from a tropical storm in 2008. The foundations of many of the buildings in the city were compromised by the flood waters, eventually leading to their collapse. It was also the target of an Al Qaeda attack in 2009.\nIn 2015, Shibam was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger when violent civil war erupted in Yemen. Historic buildings were significantly damaged during heavy bombing in Sana'a, and remain at risk from armed conflict.\n\nGeography\nThe town is located in the central-western area of Hadhramaut Governorate, in the desert of Ramlat al-Sab'atayn. Its main road links Sana'a and other cities of western Yemen to the far eastern territories. The nearest towns are Seiyun, seat of an airport, and Tarim, both in the east. Another road, departing from the village of Alajlanya, in the west, links Shibam to Mukalla, the governorate's capital on the Indian Ocean.\n\nClimate\nShibam has a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh). At an average temperature of 28.0 degrees Celsius (82.4 degrees Fahrenheit), June is the hottest month of the year. January is the coldest month, with temperatures averaging 18.6 °C (65.5 °F).\n\nInfluence\nThe Dubai Global Village, an open-air shopping and entertainment complex in the United Arab Emirates, includes a Yemeni pavilion with mud-brick structures intended to evoke the architecture of Shibam.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nMukalla\nMarib\nSeiyun\nTarim\n\nReferences\nSources\nLewcock, Ronald B.

          "content": "Zabid (Arabic: زَبِيد) (also spelled Zabīd, Zabeed and Zebid) is a town with an urban population of around 52,590 people, located on Yemen's western coastal plain. It is one of the oldest towns in Yemen, and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993. However, in 2000, the site was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The town was the capital of several ruling dynasties in Yemen over many centuries.\n\nHistory\nThe town is one of the oldest in Yemen. It was originally a village known as al-Husayb that was inhabited by the Asha'ir tribe. It later took on the name of the Wadi Zabid, the valley to its south. According to tradition, the town's early history is associated with Abu Musa al-Ash'ari, one of the companions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who is said to have built the al-Asha'ir Mosque as the fifth mosque in the history of Islam. \nThe present town was created circa 820 by Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Ziyad, the founder of the Ziyadid dynasty, who had been sent by the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun to suppress a rebellion of the Asha'ir and Akk tribes. It became the capital of the Ziyadids (up to 1016) and continued to serve this role under their successors, the Najahid dynasty (from 1022 to 1158) and the Mahdids (1158 to 1174). During this time the city grew in importance. Its mosques, including the al-Asha'ir Mosque and the Great Mosque, became centers of Islamic learning. Its location on the road between Mecca and Aden also granted the city economic prosperity.\nIn 1067, during the pilgrimage to Mecca, the Banu Najah clan under Sa'id Ibn Najah, the prince of Zabid, attacked the travel party of the Sulayhid sultan, Ali al-Sulayhi, and his wife Asma bint Shihab. They killed Ali and took Asma prisoner. She was sequestered in a secret prison in Zabid, and the severed head of her spouse was reportedly planted on a pole visible from her cell. After a year's imprisonment, she managed to get a message through to her son and daughter-in-law in Sanaa, and her son stormed Zabid and freed her.\nAli ibn Mahdi, a native of the Yemeni highlands, founded the Mahdid dynasty in the Tihama region. Al-Himyari and his followers burned down several districts north of Zabid. He had sworn to put the Abyssinians into slavery and ordered his men to kill everyone, including the handicapped. Out of desperation, the people of Zabid sought assistance from the Zaydi imam Ahmed ibn Sulayman against al-Himyari. The Zaydi imam ordered Fatiq III to be executed on account of his alleged homosexuality. Fatiq III was either killed by the Imam, the Mahdids, or his own soldiers. With this event, the slave dynasty came an end and the Mahdids took over Zabid in 1158.\nAfter the Ayyubids took control of Yemen in 1174, Zabid continued to be the economic and political center of the region. Under the Rasulid dynasty (1229–1454), the official capital was moved to Ta'izz but the rulers continued to use Zabid as a winter residence. The city reached its apogee during this period and had a larger number of palaces, gardens, and religious institutions than any other city in Yemen. Al-Khazraji, a local 14th-century Arab writer, claimed that the city counted between 230 and 240 mosques. Even today, the city reportedly has the highest concentration of mosques in Yemen.\nHadım Suleiman Pasha extended the Ottoman Empire's authority to include Zabid in 1539. Zabid became the administrative headquarters of Yemen Eyalet.\n\nToday, however, Zabid is at the economic margins of modern Yemen. Muhammad Abdul-Wali's novel Sana'a: An Open City tells the story of a young man who traveled to Zabid in the mid-20th century and was surprised to find the town had become a backwater. Some descendants of the Rasulids continue to use Zabid alongside their nobiliary particles.\n\nGeography\nZabid has an urban population of around 52,590 persons. It is located on Yemen's western coastal plain, in the Tihama region.\n\nWorld Heritage Site\nZabid was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1993. Zabid's Great Mosque occupies a prominent place in the town. The vestiges of its university can also be visited. In 2000, Zabid was listed on the List of World Heritage in Danger; the listing was made at the behest of the Yemeni government due to a state of poor upkeep and conservation. According to a UNESCO report, roughly \"40% of the city's houses have been replaced by concrete buildings, and other houses and the ancient souk are in a deteriorating state. The ongoing Yemeni civil war also poses a threat to Zabid's heritage. Some historic homes were damaged by coalition bombing in 2015. Further concerns were raised in 2018 as fighting drew near to the city.\n\nEconomy\nAs of 1920, Zabid was one of two places in Arabia growing indigo. Zabid also grows and produces cotton. The British cite tribal disputes as dampening the economy in Zabid during the early 20th century.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Site listing\nEncyclopædia Britannica, Zabid",

          "title": "Aden",
          "content": "Aden (Arabic: عَدَنْ‎, romanized: ʿAdan; IPA: [ʕa.dan]) is a port city located in Yemen in the southern part of the Arabian peninsula, on the north coast of the Gulf of Aden, positioned near the eastern approach to the Red Sea. It is situated approximately 170 km (110 mi) east of the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. With its strategic location on the coastline, Aden serves as a gateway between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, making it a crucial maritime hub connecting Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. As of September 2025, Aden has a population of approximately  1,154,000 residents, making it one of the largest cities in Yemen.\nAden is the capital and principal part of Aden Governorate, encompassing eight districts. During the colonial period, the name Aden referred to the area along the north coast of the gulf, encompassing Tawahi, Mualla, Crater, and much of Khor Maksar district. The western harbour peninsula, known as Little Aden, now falls within the Al Buraiqeh district.\n\nBefore gaining independence, Aden comprised distinct sectors: Crater, the original port; Ma'alla, the modern port; Tawahi, formerly \"Steamer Point\"; and Gold Mohur resorts. Khormaksar, on the isthmus connecting Aden to the mainland, hosts diplomatic missions, Aden University's main offices, and Aden International Airport. On the mainland, sectors include Sheikh Othman, an old oasis area; Al-Mansura, a British-planned town; and Madinat ash-Sha'b (formerly Madinat al-Ittihad), the former capital of the South Arabian Federation, now housing a large power/desalination facility and additional Aden University faculties.\nAden encloses the eastern side of a vast, natural harbour that constitutes the modern port. Little Aden was developed as the site of the oil refinery and tanker port. Both were established and operated by British Petroleum until they were turned over to South Yemeni government ownership and control in 1978.\nAden used to be the capital of South Yemen until its unity with North Yemen on 22 May 1990. It is currently the temporary capital of Yemen since the 2014 Coup d'état, hosting some members of the Cabinet of Yemen mainly in al-Maashiq Palace. It is also the seat of the secessionist Southern Transitional Council, which exercises control over the city.\n\nEtymology\nAden is a home and a place for ships, and the word Aden means reside in the place, so the word \"Aden\" means resident, and it is said \"Aden Al-Balad\", meaning the settlement of the country. Among the sayings of geographers about the city:\nYaqut al-Hamwi said: \"It is a famous city on the coast of the Indian Sea, towards the Yemen, and it is poor, with no water or pasture. They drink from a spring between it and Aden, about a distance of about today, and despite that, it is bad, except that this place is the port for Indian ships, and merchants gather there for that reason, as it is a town of trade.\" And it is added to Abyan, which is the opposite of Aden in its entirety.\nIbn Manzur said: \"It is a country on the edge of the sea in the furthest part of Yemen.\"\nIbn Khaldun said: \"This Aden is one of the most fortified cities in Yemen, and it is on the bank of the Indian Sea. It is still a country of trade from the time of the Trabaids, and most of them were built with stones, which is why silk merchants visit it often.\"\n\nHistory\nAntiquity\nAden is an ancient port and was mentioned by the Greeks under the name (Ancient Greek: Αραβία Εμπόριον, romanised: Arabia Emporion), which means an Arabic trade port. The port's convenient position on the sea route between India and Europe has made Aden desirable to rulers who sought to possess it at various times throughout history. Known as Eudaemon (Ancient Greek: Ευδαίμων, meaning \"blissful, prosperous\") in the 1st century BC, it was a transshipping point for the Red Sea trade, but fell on hard times when new shipping practices by-passed it and made the daring direct crossing to India in the 1st century AD, according to the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. The same work describes Aden as \"a village by the shore\", which would well describe the town of Crater while it was still little developed. There is no mention of fortification at this stage. Aden was more an island than a peninsula, as the isthmus (a tombolo) was not then so developed as it is today. Aden was explicitly mentioned by this name in the Book of Ezekiel, which talks about Jerusalem, and it says:\"The merchants of Sheba and Raamah are your merchants. They set up your markets with the finest perfumes and every precious stone and gold. Harran, Qena, and Aden are the merchants of Sheba, and Assyria and Kilmud are your merchants.\"At its beginning, the city was a small peninsula with no significant natural resources, but its location between Egypt and India made it important in the ancient Indian Ocean trade route. The city was the home of the ancient Kingdom of Awsan from the eighth to seventh centuries BC. In the beginning of the seventh century BC, Karibʾil Watar I, king of the Kingdom of Sheba, launched a campaign against Awsan during which, according to the Sabaean texts, sixteen thousand people were killed, forty thousand people were enslaved, and the kings of Awsan made offerings to the god Almaqah, according to the inscription that Karibʾil Watar I left in Sirwah, commemorating his victory.\nIn the second half of the first century BC, the Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar determined to control Arabia Felix and reach the Indian Ocean. Aelius Gallus' Roman expedition to Arabia Felix (26–25 BCE) aimed to capture the Sabaean capital of Marib but failed due to extreme desert conditions, disease, and logistical challenges. After an unsuccessful week-long siege, the army, weakened by illness and dehydration, withdrew, losing most of its ~10,000 troops to environmental factors and disease\" The Himyarites overthrew the Kingdom of Sheba in 275 AD and took control of Aden. Recent incomplete archaeological studies suggest that the Himyarites were the ones who built the huge water cisterns currently known as the \"Cisterns of Aden\", which stored approximately 136,382,757 liters of water.\nThe Himyarite Kingdom fell in the first quarter of the sixth century AD. Yusuf Dhu Nuwas mentioned Bab al-Mandab in one of his writings. The forces of the Kingdom of Aksum were entering Yemen through it. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian I sent a fleet to fight the Himyarite Jews and support the Kingdom of Aksum and the Christians of Najran. The fleet entered through Aden. Byzantine sources indicate that the Sasanian Empire took control of the city in 571 AD.\nA local legend in Yemen states that Aden may be as old as human history itself. Some also believe that Cain and Abel are buried somewhere in the city.\n\nMedieval history\nAlthough the pre-Islamic Himyar civilisation was capable of building large structures, there seems to have been little fortification at this stage. Fortifications at Mareb and other places in Yemen and the Hadhramaut make it clear that both the Himyar and the Sabean cultures were well capable of it. Thus, watchtowers, since destroyed, are possible. However, the Arab historians Ibn al Mujawir and Abu Makhramah attribute the first fortification of Aden to Beni Zuree'a. Abu Makhramah has also included a detailed biography of Muhammad Azim Sultan Qamarbandi Naqsh in his work, Tarikh ul-Yemen. The aim seems to have been twofold: to keep hostile forces out and to maintain revenue by controlling the movement of goods, thereby preventing smuggling. In its original form, some of this work was relatively feeble.\nWith the introduction of Islam to Yemen in the seventh century AD, Aden experienced a period of stagnation that lasted until the ninth century AD. In the early years of Islam, Aden belonged to the province of Jund (Taiz). It was controlled by the state of Ziyadid and the Sulayhid. After the death of Ali bin Muhammad Al-Sulayhi, his son took charge of Zurayids, and Aden continued to pay the annual royalty until Queen Arwa bint Ahmed Al-Sulayhi reduced it. After the fall of the Sulayhid state, the Banu Zurayi became independent in Aden, taking advantage of the Sulayhids’ preoccupation with the Khawlan tribes. The Zurayites continued to rule Aden, Lahj, and Abyan for less than forty years until they fell under the Ayyubids’ control of the city. A major battle took place between Turan Shah bin Ayyub and Yasser bin Bilal al-Muhammadi, Minister of State, and the Zurayiyyah were defeated and al-Muhammadi fled to Taiz. One of the most important contributors to the defeat of the Zurayids was their ongoing wars with the Bani Mahdi in Tihama and the departure of their army to confront the Ayyubids instead of fortifying themselves in Aden.\nAfter 1175, rebuilding in a more solid form began, and ever since then Aden has been a popular city attracting sailors and merchants from Egypt, Sindh, Gujarat, East Africa and even China. According to Muqaddasi, Persians formed the majority of Aden's population in the 10th century. It was visited by the medieval scholar Ibn Battuta in the 14th century, who described Aden's reservoirs, the Cisterns of Tawila, \"These reservoirs accumulate rainwater for the sole purpose of drinking for the city's citizens.\"\nDuring the Ayyubid period in Yemen, Sana'a and its environs were more hostile to their presence than other regions. The Zaidi tribes were able to defeat the Ayyubids in 1226, but Omar bin Rasul, the founder of the Rasulid state, was able to repel them, so he tightened his control over Aden. The city regained its position during the days of the Rasulids, so they dug wells and built schools, and Aden flourished commercially. The kings of Bani Rasul were also merchants and enacted a number of laws and regulations to codify trade in the city.\nThe Banu Tahir were able to control Aden after the Banu Rasool, and the Italian traveller Lodovico di Verthama describes it as one of the most powerful cities seen on Earth during the days of the Tahirids.\n\nIn 1513, the Portuguese, led by Afonso de Albuquerque, launched an unsuccessful four-day naval siege of Aden. The Mamluks in Egypt sensed the danger and sent a force led by Hussein al-Kurdi. The victorious King Amer bin Abdul Wahhab provided great aid to the Kurds, but he suffered a heavy defeat in the Battle of Diu. The Mamluks sent a second fleet, but the victorious king refused to cooperate with the Mamluks because he had succeeded in repelling the Portuguese from Aden without their help. Hussein al-Kurdi became angry and allied with the Zaidi Imam, who was opposed to the Tahirids, al-Mutawakkil Sharaf al-Din, and the Tahirid cities fell successively, with the exception of Aden. The Ottoman Empire took control of the city in 1538. The Ottomans' goal was to prevent the Portuguese from controlling Aden, so the city witnessed difficult days, in addition to the fact that the port of Mocha gained greater importance at the expense of Aden during the sixteenth century. The city's population declined and it turned into a small village with a population of no more than 600 people. While its population was approximately eighty thousand people during the days of the Rasulid state.In 1421, China's Ming dynasty Yongle Emperor ordered principal envoy grand eunuch Li Xing and grand eunuch Zhou Man of Zheng He's fleet to convey an imperial edict with hats and robes to bestow on the king of Aden. The envoys boarded three treasure ships and set sail from Sumatra to the port of Aden. This event was recorded in the book Yingyai Shenglan by Ma Huan who accompanied the imperial envoy.\nAfter Ottoman rule, Aden was ruled by the Sultanate of Lahej, under suzerainty of the Zaidi imams of Yemen. The first political intercourse between Lahej and the British took place in 1799, when a naval force was sent from Great Britain, with a detachment of troops from India, to occupy the island of Perim and prevent all communication of the French in Egypt with the Indian Ocean, by way of the Red Sea. The island of Perim was found unsuitable for troops, and the Sultan of Lahej, Ahmed bin Abdul Karim, received the detachment for some time at Aden. He proposed to enter into an alliance and to grant Aden as a permanent station, but the offer was declined. A Treaty was, however, concluded with the Sultan in 1802 by Admiral Sir Home Popham, who was instructed to enter into political and commercial alliances with the chief rulers on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea.\n\nModern history\nThe situation was different in the north of the country, where the Zaidis did not recognise the authority of the Ottomans and revolted against them many times, the most recent of which was the revolution of Imam Al-Mansur Billah Al-Qasim bin Muhammad bin Al-Qasim, who and his son Al-Mu'ayyad Billah Muhammad were able to unite the tribes and expel the Ottomans. The imams relied on the revenues from the port of Mocha, and Aden was not as important as the Abadlahs were. At the end of the eighteenth century, Sultan Fadl al-Abdali concluded an alliance with the Yafi tribes to rebel against the Zaidi imams and monopolise Aden's revenues equally among them. The Sultan of Lahej got rid of the imams, but he did not fulfil his promise to Yafa. The Zaidi imams did not recognise inheritance and saw fighting for the imamate, so the war between Al-Nasir Muhammad bin Ishaq and Al-Mansur Al-Hussein bin Al-Mutawakkil prolonged, so Al-Abdali took the opportunity to declare his independence in Lahej and Aden. The English had been visiting Aden and Mocha from 1609, led by Sir Henry Middleton, who was imprisoned, his ships confiscated, and eight of his men killed.\nThe British tried to conclude treaties with the Zaidi imams after the Ottomans were expelled from Aden. They visited Sana'a and Mocha, but they treated the British ambassador poorly and rejected his offer. Things were different when the Abdali gained independence from Lahj and Medina. They signed a treaty with the British in 1802, stipulating that they build a factory in Crater and allocate a special cemetery for British subjects free of charge. The Abdali wanted protection from the tribes. Sultan Fadl bin Ali was killed by Yafi’ gunmen, then one of the sheikhs of Al-Hujariya invaded Lahj and besieged it for five months. Al-Awaliq also besieged it with eight thousand fighters, and they did not leave until Sultan Ahmed bin Abdul Karim paid them seven thousand dollars. Then the Fadl family attacked Aden in 1836.\n\nBritish administration 1839–1967\nIn 1609 The Ascension was the first English ship to visit Aden, before sailing on to Mocha during the fourth voyage of the East India Company.\nBritish interests in Aden began in 1796 with Napoleon's invasion of Egypt, after which a British fleet docked at Aden for several months at the invitation of the sultan. The French were defeated in Egypt in 1801, and their privateers were tracked down over the subsequent decade. By 1800, Aden was a small village with a population of 600 Arabs, Somalis, Jews, and Indians—housed for the most part in huts of reed matting erected among ruins recalling a vanished era of wealth and prosperity. As there was little British trade in the Red Sea, most British politicians until the 1830s had no further interest in the area beyond the suppression of piracy. However, a small number of government officials and the East India Company officials thought that a British base in the area was necessary to prevent another French advance through Egypt or Russian expansion through Persia. The emergence of Muhammad Ali of Egypt as a strong local ruler only increased their concerns. The governor of Bombay from 1834 to 1838, Sir Robert Grant, was one of those who believed that India could only be protected by preemptively seizing \"places of strength\" to protect the Indian Ocean.\nThe Red Sea increased in importance after the steamship Hugh Lindsay sailed from Bombay to the Suez isthmus in 1830, stopping at Aden with the sultan's consent to resupply with coal. Although cargo was still carried around the Cape of Good Hope in sailing ships, a steam route to the Suez could provide a much quicker option for transporting officials and important communications. Grant felt that armed ships steaming regularly between Bombay and Suez would help secure British interests in the region and did all he could to progress his vision. After lengthy negotiations due to the costs of investing in the new technology, the government agreed to pay half the costs for six voyages per year and the East India Company board approved the purchase of two new steamers in 1837. Grant immediately announced that monthly voyages to Suez would take place, despite the fact that no secure coal supplying station had been found. The British first stationed a coal depot on the island of Socotra in 1834. However, due to the lack of suitable infrastructure there, they quickly lost interest in Socotra and turned towards Aden instead.\nIn 1838, under Muhsin bin Fadl, Lahej ceded 194 km2 (75 sq mi) including Aden to the British. On 19 January 1839, the British East India Company landed Royal Marines at Aden to definitively conquer the territory (the so-called Aden Expedition) and stop attacks by pirates against British shipping to India. In 1850 it was declared a free trade port, with the liquor, salt, arms, and opium trades developing duties as it won all the coffee trade from Mokha. The port lies about equidistant from the Suez Canal, Bombay, and Zanzibar, which were all important British possessions. Aden had been an entrepôt and a way-station for ships in the ancient world. There, supplies, particularly water, were replenished, so, in the mid-19th century, it became necessary to replenish coal and boiler water. Thus Aden acquired a coaling station at Steamer Point and Aden was to remain under British control until November 1967.\n\nUntil 1937, Aden was governed as part of British India and was known as the Aden Settlement. Its original territory was enlarged in 1857 by the 13 km2 (5.0 sq mi) island of Perim, in 1868 by the 73 km2 (28 sq mi) Khuriya Muriya Islands, and in 1915 by the 108 km2 (42 sq mi) island of Kamaran. The settlement would become Aden Province in 1935.\n\nIn 1937, the settlement was detached from India and became the Colony of Aden, a British Crown colony. The change in government was a step towards the change in the official currency unit. When British India became independent in 1947, Indian rupees (divided into annas) were replaced in Aden by East African shillings. The hinterland of Aden and Hadhramaut were also loosely tied to Britain as the Aden Protectorate, which was overseen from Aden.\n\nAden's location also made it a useful entrepôt for mail passing between places around the Indian Ocean and Europe. Thus, a ship passing from Suez to Bombay could leave mail for Mombasa at Aden for collection (See Postage stamps and postal history of Aden). In December 1947, a three-day riot broke out in reaction to the drafting of the Partition Plan for Palestine. The riots and their repression by the Aden Protectorate Levies saw the killing of 76-82 Jews, 33 Arabs, 4 Muslim Indians and 1 Somali, in addition to looting and damaging of property. After the Suez Crisis in 1956, the British held on to Aden as an outpost in the region for another decade. The British authorities had already decided to further expand its port shortly before the Suez Canal's 1956 closure.\nAden sent a team of two to the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Western Australia.\n\nFederation of South Arabia and the Aden Emergency\nIn order to stabilise Aden and the surrounding Aden Protectorate from the designs of the Egyptian backed republicans of North Yemen, the British attempted gradually to unite the disparate states of the region in preparation for eventual independence. On 18 January 1963, the Colony of Aden was incorporated into the Federation of Arab Emirates of the South against the wishes of North Yemen. The city became the State of Aden and the Federation was renamed the Federation of South Arabia (FSA).\nAn insurgency against British administration known as the Aden Emergency began with a grenade attack by the communist National Liberation Front (NLF), against the British High Commissioner on 10 December 1963, killing one person and injuring fifty, and a \"state of emergency\" was declared.\nIn 1964, Britain announced its intention to grant independence to the FSA in 1968, but that British troops would remain in Aden. The security situation deteriorated as NLF and FLOSY (Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen) vied for the upper hand.\nIn January 1967, there were mass riots between the NLF and their rival FLOSY supporters in the old Arab quarter of Aden town. This conflict continued until mid February, despite the intervention of British troops. On 20 June 1967, 23 British Army soldiers were ambushed and shot dead by members of Aden Police during the Aden Mutiny in the Crater District. During the period there were as many attacks on the British troops by both sides as against each other culminating in the destruction of an Aden Airways DC3 plane in the air with no survivors.\nThe increased violence was a determining factor in the British ensuring all families were evacuated more quickly than initially intended, as recorded in From Barren Rocks to Living Stones.\nOn 30 November 1967, British troops were evacuated, leaving Aden and the rest of the FSA under NLF control. The Royal Marines, who had been the first British troops to arrive in Aden in 1839, were the last to leave – with the exception of a Royal Engineer detachment (10 Airfields Squadron left Aden on 13 December 1967). As part of a larger Royal Navy task force, HMS Albion's helicopters lifted off remaining Royal Marine commandos left to secure the airfield.\n\nPost-independence\nThe last British soldier left Aden on November 30, 1967, and the National Liberation Front had the upper hand at the expense of the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, whose members were divided between joining the National Front or leaving for North Yemen, so Abdullah Al-Asanj and Muhammad Basindwa left for North Yemen. Qahtan al-Sha'bi assumed the presidency of the new state, and the sheikhdoms of the Eastern Protectorate of Hadramaut and Al-Mahra were annexed to the new state. Al-Shaabi took over a new country with a collapsed economy. Civilian workers and businessmen left, and British support ceased. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 played an important role in the country's economy, as it reduced the number of ships crossing Aden by 75%.\nThe new state was divided into six governorates on December 11, 1967, in order to end the manifestations of tribalism in the state and ignore the tribal borders between the defunct sheikhdoms. On March 20, 1968, Qahtan dismissed all leftist leaders from the government and party membership. He was able to put down a rebellion led by leftist factions in the army in May of the same year, and faced new rebellions from leftist parties in July, August and December 1968. This is because all Arab countries welcomed the front. National Liberation received a cold reception. Regimes like Egypt wanted to merge the National Front with the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, where the leftist section was more numerous than the supporters of the popular Qahtan. They wanted a regime that would lead the masses and face the great challenges facing the new state, the most important of which was the bankruptcy of the treasury.\n\nQahtan al-Shaabi dismissed Interior Minister Muhammad Ali Haitham on 16 June 1969, but the latter, with his ties to the tribes and the army, reassembled the leftist forces that had been dispersed by President Qahtan al-Shaabi, and they were able to place him under house arrest on 22 June. A presidential committee was formed from Five people: Salem Rabie Ali, who became president, Muhammad Saleh Al-Awlaki, Ali Antar, Abdel Fattah Ismail, and Muhammad Ali Haitham, who became prime minister. This group took an extreme leftist line, declaring its support for the Palestinians and the Dhofar Revolution, and strengthening its relationship with the Soviet Union. West Germany severed its relationship with the state due to its recognition of East Germany, and the United States also severed its relationship in October 1969. The new powers issued a new constitution, nationalised foreign banks and insurance companies, and changed the name of the country to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in line with the Marxist–Leninist approach they followed. A centrally planned economy was established. The port of Aden was the largest source of national income for the Republic of South Yemen, but the closure of the Suez Canal by Egypt between 1967 and 1975 - reduced commercial activities in the port.\nSalem Rabie Ali wanted to adopt a practical approach, so he communicated with the President of North Yemen, Ibrahim al-Hamdi, and made attempts to restore normal relations with Western countries. During his presidency, relations between South Yemen and Saudi Arabia were established in 1976. President Salmin, as he is known, coveted more Soviet support, so the contract with Saudi Arabia worried him. The Soviets pushed them to increase aid, but relations with Saudi Arabia became strained again in 1977 following the assassination of North Yemeni President Ibrahim al-Hamdi. It is believed that Salem Rabie Ali orchestrated the assassination of Ahmed Hussein al-Ghashmi in revenge for Ibrahim al-Hamdi. Salem Rabie Ali was subjected to a quick trial that ended with his execution and Abdel Fattah Ismail assuming the presidency of South Yemen. Relations with North Yemen became tense, due to Fattah's support for the factions opposing Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was more fanatical than his predecessors. Relations with the Soviet Union became active in an unprecedented way, so the Front War broke out in 1978, in which the Soviet Union and the United States intervened.\nAli Nasser Muhammad was able to force Abd al-Fattah Ismail al-Jawfi to resign for \"health reasons\", and Ismail was exiled to Moscow two years after he assumed the presidency. Despite the approach of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and its removal of tribal aspects, tribalism remained alive among politicians and the public despite the exposure of its sheikhs. Tribes from their authorities. Tribal and regional favouritism and nepotism remained rife in southern Yemen, as political forces called on their tribal and regional affiliations during crises.\n\nBy January 1986, Aden was torn apart by the rivalry of two factions in the ruling Socialist Party, when President Ali Nasser Muhammad's guards launched a surprise attack on the political party's office in Aden on January 13, 1986. This was the beginning of the 1986 civil war in South Yemen. The basis of the war was regional. Ali Nasser Muhammad was from Abyan Governorate, while most of those killed in the political party office were from Al-Dhalea and Lahj. Military brigades from those areas bombed Aden from land and sea, forcing Ali Nasser Muhammad to flee and hundreds of thousands of civilians and soldiers to flee to northern Yemen, including Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi. This was followed by systematic killings and liquidations against the people of Abyan Governorate, on charges that they were collaborating with Ali Nasser Muhammad. Nearly ten thousand people were killed and thousands migrated towards North Yemen, most of whom were from Abyan and Shabwa.\nWith the unification of north and south Yemen in 1990, Aden was no longer a national capital but remained the capital of Aden Governorate which covered an area similar to that of the Aden Colony.\nOn 29 December 1992, Al Qaeda conducted its first known terrorist attack in Aden, bombing the Gold Mohur Hotel, where US servicemen were known to have been staying en route to Somalia for Operation Restore Hope. A Yemeni and an Austrian tourist died in the attack.\n\nThat war marked the end of the state of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, and Haider Abu Bakr Al-Attas assumed the presidency until May 22, 1990, the unity of South Yemen with North Yemen, and the establishment of the Republic of Yemen. At that time, Ali Salem Al-Baidh was considered Ali Abdullah Saleh's deputy, and Haider Abu Bakr Al-Attas was considered prime minister, and after the 1993 elections. Conflicts began within the ruling coalition, and Vice President Ali Salem Al-Beidh retreated to Aden in August 1993. The general security situation in the country deteriorated, and the complete integration of the two armies failed. The southern forces, which were transferred to Amran, clashed with the northern forces there, and the forces of the northern giants, which were transferred to Amran, clashed. Abyan with the southern forces, and the political parties signed the 1994 Covenant and Agreement, in the Jordanian capital, on February 20, 1994, in an attempt to end the crisis, and successive events led to the outbreak of the Summer 1994 civil war, and the southern military leaders who fled after the events of 1986 joined the ranks of the forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and supported the Unity Army in the war against their former comrades in 1994 in the war against the separatists. At the forefront of these emerged a group of the brightest officers, such as President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, who became Minister of Defense at the time, the former Chief of Staff, Major General Abdullah Aliwa, and Major General Salem Qatan, who was assassinated by an Al-Qaeda gunman. After the war, Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi was appointed Vice President of the Republic, and remained in office. He held his position until 2012, when he was elected president of the country.\nMembers of al Qaeda attempted to bomb the US guided-missile destroyer The Sullivans at the port of Aden as part of the 2000 millennium attack plots. The boat that had the explosives in it sank, forcing the planned attack to be aborted.\nThe bombing attack on destroyer USS Cole took place in Aden on 12 October 2000.\nIn 2007 growing dissatisfaction with unification led to the formation of the secessionist South Yemen Movement. According to The New York Times, the Movement's mainly underground leadership includes socialists, Islamists and individuals desiring a return to the perceived benefits of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.\n\nTemporary capital and civil war\nAden remained in a state of political stagnation for 25 years until President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi took refuge there and carried out his work from the Republican Palace in Aden. Hadi declared Aden the temporary capital on March 7, 2015, instead of Sana’a, which he described as occupied by the Houthis. This was after the Houthis took control of Sanaa on September 21, 2014, and imposed a siege on the Republican Palace and the home of President Hadi on January 20. Hadi submitted his resignation on January 22 to Parliament, which did not hold a session to accept or reject the resignation, and Hadi remained under house arrest imposed by the Houthis. Until he was able to leave for Aden on February 21, 2015, he retracted his resignation, and announced a statement in which he said, \"All decisions taken since September 21 are invalid and have no legitimacy.\"\nPresident Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi fled to Aden, his hometown, in February 2015 after being deposed in the coup d'état that many consider to be the start of the Yemeni civil war. Others consider that the civil war began in September 2014 when Houthi forces took over the capital city Sana'a, which was followed by a rapid Houthi takeover of the government.\nHadi declared in Aden that he was still Yemen's legitimate president and called on state institutions and loyal officials to relocate to Aden. In a televised speech on 21 March 2015, he declared Aden to be Yemen's \"economic and temporary capital\" while Sana'a is controlled by the Houthis.\nAden was hit by violence in the aftermath of the coup d'état, with forces loyal to Hadi clashing with those loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh in a battle for Aden International Airport on 19 March 2015. After the airport battle, the entire city became a battleground for the Battle of Aden, which left large parts of the city in ruins and has killed at least 198 people since 25 March 2015.\nSome Arab and foreign embassies were transferred to Aden, and Defense Minister Mahmoud Al-Subaihi was able to leave Sanaa for Aden and met with President Hadi. On March 4, 2016, unidentified gunmen stormed the Mother Teresa House in the city and killed sixteen people, including four nuns. A number of the old city's churches have also been destroyed by Islamic extremists since mid-2015.\nOn 14 July 2015, the Saudi Arabian Army launched an offensive to win control of the city. Within three days, the city was cleared of Houthi rebels, ending the Battle of Aden with a coalition victory.\nBeginning on 28 January 2018, separatists loyal to the Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized control of the Yemeni government headquarters in Aden in a coup d'état against the Hadi-led government.\nOn 30 December 2020, the undersecretary of labour and deputy minister of public works were killed along with between 20 and 30 others at the Aden airport while they conducted an international press briefing about their new arrangements with the STC, which includes the partition of forces inside Aden, as they returned from hiding in the Saudi capital. Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed, his ministers and his entourage were conducted to safety under the barrage of hostile fire.\n\nCulture\nDialects\nThe entry of the Yemenis into Islam contributed to their abandoning their ancient script and replacing it with the late Nabataean alphabet in which the Qur’an was written. Today, Yemenis speak Arabic in the Yemeni dialect, which is a developed dialect and closely linked to the ancient language. It has three dialects with branches: the Sanani dialect, the Hadrami dialect, and the Taizi-Adeni dialect, in addition to the Bedouin dialect of the residents of Marib. Al-Jawf, Shabwa, and Inner Hadhramaut, and each of these dialects has characteristics and features.\n\nMusic and poetry\nAdeni art or the Adeniyat is an art of Arabic music. Among the ancient artists of Aden are Iskander Thabet Saleh and Muhammad Murshid Naji, and among the poets are Abdul Rahman Ibrahim Muhammad, Ahmed Ghaleb Muhammad Al-Jabri, Abdullah Abdul Karim Muhammad, Ali Abdullah Jaafar Aman, Farid Muhammad Barakat, Lotfi Jaafar Aman, and Mohsen Ali Brik.\n\"Adeni music\" played a major role in Aden society, and artists in the Aden dialect were called \"al-Mutariba\", meaning people of music. Adeni music began in 1920 when the army of the Aden Protectorate was formed, and after it the National Guard, where there were teams for those forces and those teams participated On special occasions and weddings.\n\nSports\nPre-independence\nThe first beginning of Adenian sports dates back to the year 1902, when the Adeni Tennis Club was established, with its headquarters in the Al-Qatee’ neighbourhood in Crater, and Youssef Muhammad Khan founded the \"Recreational Club United\" in the city of Crater, and it was known as the Yousef Khan Stadium. The city of Aden is considered the first city in which sports were practiced in the Arabian Peninsula, and the first private club in Aden was founded in 1905 under the name \"Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club\", as the first sports club in Yemen and the Arab world. He was fighting the occupation army divisions and the fleet divisions coming and passing to the port of Aden.\nIn 1924, the \"Al-Husseini Sports Club\" was founded in Crater, and a third club appeared in Tawahi under the name \"Al-Bamboot Club\" and Sheikh Othman. The 1930s witnessed the emergence of a number of clubs. In 1933, the \"Nujoom Al-Layl Club\", Al-Aidrousi Club, and Nujoom Al-Sabah Club appeared in Crater, and in Tawahi, the \"Al-Ittihad Al-Islami Club\" (Al-Mawlada) appeared.\nUntil that year, football matches were played in a friendly manner between the teams of the Crater, Al-Tawahi, and Sheikh Othman regions, as there were no federations regulating sports activity. In 1934, the occupation authority announced the establishment of a sports association called the \"Adeniya Sports Association\", after the increasing number of local clubs. Its members were appointed by the Governor-General of Aden, and all of its members were English, headed by the English Governor of Aden, Bernard Reilly, as sponsor. The association's board of directors consists of Hikam Bottom as president, the Indian Rosario as secretary, and two other members.\nThis association began holding the first club tournament, which was the \"Rosario Cup Championship\". Six clubs participated in the tournament, three from Crater (Al-Ittihad Al-Mohammadi, Al-Husseini, and Nojoom Al-Layl), from Al-Tawahi (Al-Mawalda, and Al-Bamiot), and from Sheikh Othman, Sheikh Othman Club, which includes Players from various small teams in the Sheikh Othman area, and Al-Ittihad Al-Mohammadi Club won this championship.\nAmong the most important tournaments held in Aden before independence were the Rosario Cup, the Riley Cup, the Somali Bassem Al-Nar Cup, the Aramco Cup, and the Kik Muncherji Championship.\n\nPost-independence\nAfter independence, the \"Football Federation\" was established on January 18, 1968, on the ruins of the \"Adeniya Sports Association\". The Federation took a decision regarding the Adeniya clubs, which had numbered about 64 sports clubs, reducing and merging the clubs in Aden and Lahj to only 16 clubs, and the clubs were forced to join or unite with large teams. In February 1968, several sports clubs were abolished, leaving only 12 clubs remaining. In December 1968, Al-Islah Club and Al-Shaab Club were merged into one club under the name of the latter in Al-Tawahi. In 1969, the Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club and Al-Tadamon Club were united in Crater, under the name Al-Tadamon Al-Muhammadi Club.\nIn the \"First General Sports Conference\" in 1973, the clubs were merged and reduced again, so that their number became only 7 clubs: Al-Ahrar Club, Al-Ahly Club, Shamsan Club, Al-Shaab Club, Al-Hilal Club, United Youth Club, and Aden Tennis Club. On July 18, 1975, the stage of forming urban clubs, and the beginning of the stage of politicisation of the clubs in favour of the National Liberation Front, took place. It was decided to change their names and reduce them to become 5 clubs: Al-Tilal Club, Shamsan Club, Al-Minaa Club, Al-Wahda Club, and Al-Shoula Club.\nOn July 18, 1975, the \"Al-Tilal Sports Club\" appeared, headed by Yassin Saeed Noman, as a new name for the \"Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club\", which was founded in 1905, and in 1976 the \"Yemeni Football Federation\" appeared. Al-Tilal Club participated in the \"September 26 Cup Competition\" in 1980, as the first football competition in which it participated with teams from northern and southern Yemen, such as the national team of Ibb Governorate, Taiz Governorate, Hadhramaut Governorate, Lahj and Hodeidah, at the Shaheed Al-Dharafi Stadium in Sana’a, and Al-Hilal was crowned champion of the September 26 Cup, after victory over Hodeidah national team by five clean goals.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Aden. There are 9 stadiums in Aden, including the May 22 International Stadium, and 10 sports clubs. In November 2010, Aden hosted the 2010 Arabian Gulf Football Cup.\n\nTourist sites\nAden has several historical and natural sites of interest to visitors. These include:\n\nThe historical British churches, one of which lies empty and semi-derelict in 2019.\nThe Zoroastrian Temple\nThe Cisterns of Tawila—an ancient water-catchment system located in the sub-centre of Crater\nSira Fortress\nThe Aden Minaret\nLittle Ben, a miniature Big Ben Clock Tower overlooking Steamer Point. Built during the colonial period, this was restored in 2012 after 3 decades of neglect since the British withdrawal of 1967.\nThe Landing Pier at Steamer Point is a 19th-century building used by visiting dignitaries during the colonial period, most notably Queen Elizabeth during her 1954 visit to the colony. This building was hit by an airstrike in 2015 and is currently in the process of being restored in 2019.\nThe Crescent Hotel which contained a number of artifacts relating to the Royal Visit of 1954 and which currently remains derelict as a result of a recent airstrike.\nThe Palace of the Sultanate of Lahej/National Museum—The National Museum was founded in 1966 and is located in what used to be the Palace of the Sultanate of Lahej. Northern forces robbed it during the 1994 Civil War, but its collection of pieces remains one of the biggest in Yemen.\nThe Aden Military Museum which features a painting depicting the 20 June 1967 ambush by Arab Police Barracks on a British Army unit when a number of the 22 soldiers killed that day were driving in two Land Rovers on Queen Arwa Road, Crater.\nThe Rimbaud House, which opened in 1991, is the two-story house of French poet Arthur Rimbaud who lived in Aden from 1880 to 1891. Rimbaud moved to Aden on his way to Ethiopia in an attempt for a new life. As of the late 1990s, the first floor of the house belonged to the French Consulate, a cultural centre and a library. The house is located in al-Tawahi—the European Quarter of Aden—and is politically and culturally debated for its French nature in an area previously colonised by Britain.\nThe fortifications of Jebal Hadid and Jebal Shamsan\nThe beaches of Aden and Little Aden—Some of the popular beaches in Aden consist of Lover's Bay Beach, Elephant Beach and Gold Beach. The popular beach in Little Aden is called Blue Beach. Some beaches are private and some are public, which is subject to change over time due to the changing resort industry. According to the Wall Street Journal, kidnappings on the beaches and the threat of Al Qaeda has caused problems for the resort industry in Aden, which used to be popular among locals and Westerners.\nAl-Aidaroos Mosque\nMain Pass – now called Al-Aqba Road is the only road into Aden through Crater. Originally an Arched Upper bridge known as Main Gate, it overlooked Aden city and was built during the Ottoman Empire. A painted crest of the 24th British army battalion is still visible on the brickwork adjacent to the Gate site and is believed to be the only remaining army Crest from colonial rule still visible in Aden. In March 1963 the bridge was removed by a British Army controlled explosion to widen the 2 lane roadway to the present 4 lane highway and the only reminder of this bridge is a quarter scale replica built at the end of the Al-Aqba road intersection known as the AdenGate Model roundabout.\n\nEconomy and transportation\nThe industrial activity in Aden is represented by a group of factories and production units, the forefront of which is the oil refinery. The oil refinery in Aden is considered one of the first refineries to be established in the region, and began operating in 1954 AD. The Aden Refineries Company has facilities such as an oil tanker port, a network of storage tanks, and a centre to supply ships with fuel.\nHistorically, Aden was a station for importing goods from the African coast and from Europe, the United States, and India. As of 1920, Aden was a major commercial centre for trade in the Arabian Peninsula, and the port exported small quantities of local products to most Arab ports. Aden provided coal and salt to passing ships, and the port was a stopping point for ships when they entered Bab al-Mandab.\n\nTransport\nHistorically, the port of Aden was the main transport port in the region. Passenger ships land in Al-Tawahi District, and the city is served by Aden International Airport, which is about 10 kilometres (6 mi) from the city. The airport is the main headquarters of Al-Saeeda Airlines and its operations centre. The airport is considered the second largest airport. In Yemen, after Sana'a International Airport, it is considered the best airport in Yemen in terms of location due to the mountainous nature of Yemen. However, this airport is surrounded by the Arabian Sea in terms of take-off and landing. The establishment of Aden Airport dates back to the year 1927 when the British forces established a military airport in the district. Khor Maksar. After World War II, Britain carried out extensive urban modernisation and built Aden International Airport, known today, next to the military airport. Al-Yamda Airlines was the official carrier of South Yemen, before unification, and was based in Aden, before merging with Yemen Airways in 1996. Before the Battle of Aden Airport and the 2015 military intervention in Yemen closed this airport along with other airports in Yemen.  On 22 July, Aden International Airport was declared fit for operation again after the Houthi forces were driven from the city, and a Saudi plane carrying aid reportedly became the first plane to land in Aden in four months. The same day, a ship chartered by the World Food Programme carrying fuel docked in Aden's port.\nHistorically, Aden's harbour has been a major hub of transportation for the region. As of 1920, the harbour was 13 by 6 km (8 by 4 mi) in size. Passenger ships landed at Steamer Point now called Tawahi.\nDuring the British colonial period motor vehicles drove on the left, as in the United Kingdom. On 2 January 1977, Aden, along with the rest of South Yemen, changed to driving on the right, bringing it into line with neighbouring Arab states.\nDuring the early 20th century, Aden was a prominent export centre for coffee grown in the Jubail highlands. And also to export frankincense, wheat, barley, alfalfa and millet, which are produced and exported from Aden. The leaves and stems of clover, millet, and corn produced in Aden were generally used as fodder. Beginning in 1920, Aden was desalinating seawater to produce table salt. Between 1916 and 1917, Aden produced more than 120,000 tons of salt. Aden also produced potash, which was exported to Mumbai.\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, Aden would import goods from the African coast and from Europe, the United States, and India. As of 1920, the British described it as \"the chief emporium of Arabian trade, receiving the small quantities of native produce, and supplying the modest wants of the interior and of most of the smaller Arabian ports.\" At the docks, the city provided coal to passing ships. The only item being produced by the city, as of 1920, was salt. Also, the port was the stop ships had to take when entering the Bab-el-Mandeb; this was how cities like Mecca had received goods by ship. Yemen Airlines, the national airline of South Yemen, had its head office in Aden. On 15 May 1996, Yemen Airlines merged with Yemenia.\nDuring the early 20th century Aden was a notable centre of coffee production. Women processed coffee beans, grown in the Yemen highlands. Frankincense, wheat, barley, alfalfa, and millet was also produced and exported from Aden. The leaves and stalks of the alfalfa, millet and maize produced in Aden were generally used as fodder. As of 1920, Aden was also gathering salt from salt water. An Italian company called Agostino Burgarella Ajola and Company gathered and process the salt under the name Aden Salt Works. There was also a smaller company from India, called Abdullabhoy and Joomabhoy Lalji & Company that owned a salt production firm in Aden. Both companies exported the salt. Between 1916 and 1917, Aden produced over 120,000 tons of salt. Aden has also produced potash, which was generally exported to Mumbai.\nAden produced jollyboats. Charcoal was produced as well, from acacia, and mainly in the interior of the region. Cigarettes were produced by Jewish and Greek populations in Aden. The tobacco used was imported from Egypt.\nSince the outbreak of the Yemeni Civil War spread to Aden in 2015, the city has been struck by constant protests over a range of issues, but especially concerning electricity generation. Aden's power grid is composed solely of diesel generators and is thus heavily dependent on imported fuel. The main power plant is al-Hasswa diesel power plant, which in June 2021 had only two turbines out of five running, producing up to 50 megawatts (MW) of power in a region where the deficit hovers around 300 MW. Nawfal al-Mojamal, the plant director, said \"In its 35 years of existence, al-Hasswa station never had any kind of maintenance, except in 2016 ... when the two turbines were restored\".\n\nFree zone\nThe free zone, which was opened in 1991, represents Yemen's economic gateway and the meeting point of the continents of Asia and Africa. The free zone gains its strategic importance from the special location of the port of Aden, as it is located directly on the main trade route around the world and from the Middle East to Europe and America, and is distinguished by the possibility of providing transit services. To East Africa, the Red Sea, the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Gulf. The free zone represents a storage and distribution area suitable for Africa, the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf.\n\nGeography and climate\nGeography\nAden is located on the coast of the Gulf of Aden, and is about 363 kilometres away from the capital, Sana’a. It is located between latitudes 47 and 12 north of the equator, and at an altitude of 6 metres above sea level. It is surrounded by Lahj Governorate to the north and east, and the Governorate of Abyan is from the northwest, and Aden has an air port represented by Aden International Airport, and a sea port represented by the port of Aden, and it has land routes from the north linking it to Hajj, Abyan and Taiz.\n\nLandforms\nThe city of Aden is a coastal city, as it overlooks a large body of water, the Gulf of Aden, which in turn opens to the Indian Ocean. The shape of the city of Aden in the form of two peninsulas helped this factor to make the city of Aden unique in this particularity, which clearly affected the occurrence of the phenomenon of land and sea breezes. Which occurs due to air exchange between land and water during the day and night. Its location on the water surface also affects the daily and annual temperature range. This does not mean that there are no significant differences in temperatures in summer and winter.\nThe surface of the city of Aden slopes south, and the highlands appear in the southern part of Aden, represented by the highlands of Jabal Shamsan, whose highest peaks exceed 500 metres, and the highlands of Jabal Ihsan and Jabal Al-Muzalqim in Little Aden, which are lower in height than Jabal Shamsan, and the highlands of Aden do not differ from the rest of the highlands of Yemen in terms of In terms of composition, it is of volcanic origin, and although the mountain highlands occupy large areas of the city, their influence is weak and limited on the climate of the city of Aden.\n\nClimate\nAden has a hot desert climate (BWh) in the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system. Although Aden sees next to no precipitation year-round, it is humid throughout the year.\n\nEnvironment\nCoasts\nMost of the coasts of Aden Governorate along the coastal strip are sandy coasts, and the governorate has coastal beaches, including the Golden Coast in Al-Tawahi District, the coast of Abyan Bakhour Maksar, Al-Ghadeer Beach, and Kud Al-Nimr Beach in Buraiqa.\n\nOffshore islands\nThere are about 21 islands around the peninsulas of Aden, Aden Lesser, and Ras Amran. They are mostly rocky islands, some of which are surrounded by incomplete coral reefs, and most of them are considered fishing areas. A number of islands have many activities, especially on Al-Ummal Island and Sirah Island.\n\nWild and domestic animal diversity\nYemen is considered one of the countries rich in bird species in the Middle East due to the availability of many suitable coastal environments that helped attract many migratory birds to wetland sites, coasts and islands. The Aden region (Khor Maksar - Al-Haswah) was registered on the list of important areas of the World Bird Organization as a habitat. The last three species that are globally threatened with extinction are: the great eagle, the gull eagle, and the eastern king eagle.\nThere are dozens of bird species recorded in the wetlands of Aden and the Caltex swamp area, which are rich in a wide variety of endemic and migratory birds, including birds that are present throughout the year. There are many birds in the area, including great flamingos, dwarf flamingos, and rock egrets. And the spoonbill, the hooked tern and the seagull.\n\nPublic services\nEducation\nThere are 95 schools in Aden, including 13 kindergartens, and 82 basic education schools, including 29 schools for boys, 29 schools for girls, and 29 joint schools for boys and girls. There are also 29 secondary schools, including 15 schools for boys and 14 schools for girls, all of which are in a double shift system.

In secondary education, the number of male students reached 11,029 students, and 9,643 female students.\nAs for vocational, technical and vocational education centres and institutes, their number is 13, with 2,214 students enrolled, including 453 teachers. The health institutes have one institute, with 864 students enrolled, including 147 teachers, according to 2010 statistics.

More than 29 thousand students are enrolled, according to 2010 statistics.\n\nHealth\nThere are 15 hospitals in the economic capital, Aden, including 5 public government hospitals, 6 belonging to the private sector, and 37 health centres. There are 34 facilities in the city that provide maternity and childhood services, and the number of specialised workforce in health facilities is 2,825 specialists.\n\nEndemic areas\nIn June 2015, the International Red Cross team present in conflict areas in Yemen during the events of the Yemeni civil war announced that the cities of Crater, Al-Mualla, Khor Maksar and Al-Tawahi in the Aden Governorate in the south of the country were areas affected by dengue fever. The health authorities in Aden said that this fever had spread remarkably and widely. Since the beginning of May, health services have deteriorated and infrastructure facilities, such as electricity, water, and sanitation, have been damaged as a result of the ongoing fighting in the city for months.\n\nMail\nAden has known mail since June 15, 1839, that is, a year after the British occupation, although the official post office was not inaugurated until 1857. Postage stamps of both Britain and India were used in Aden until it became called the Aden Colony on April 1, 1937, although the stamps of this stage It bears no distinctive sign, but the use of the number 124 as a postal code is attributed to Aden as part of the Indian postal numerical system.\nThen, when it became a colony in 1937, it had sets of postage stamps containing pictures and the name Aden printed on them. In 1939, a new postage set was issued containing a picture of King George VI, but the Sultans of Hadhramaut - who were under the umbrella of the Aden Protectorate - controlled Britain has had it since the 1880s - they refused to do so, and so Britain issued a separate postal set in 1942, but this time with the inclusion of a phrase and pictures expressing the Kathiri Sultanate in Sayun and the Qu’aiti Sultanate in Shihr and Mukalla, in addition to pictures of the sultans.\n\nMedia\nJournalism\nThe weekly Al-Amal newspaper was founded in 1957 in Aden. Its slogan was (Freedom, Bread, and Peace). The British authorities allowed only 1,500 copies to be printed weekly, and the newspaper was banned shortly after.\nIn 1958, Al-Ayyam newspaper was established in Aden, as an independent daily newspaper in the Arabic language, during the British occupation. The first issue was published on July 30, 1958, and its founder and editor-in-chief was Brigadier General Muhammad Ali Bashraheel. It stopped publishing after independence during the era of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, and then resumed publication. After achieving Yemeni unity, the first issue of the second edition was on November 7, 1990, after a hiatus that lasted more than 23 years. In 1998, Al-Ayyam was the first newspaper in Yemen that the government prosecuted under a criminal law. Other cases followed until it became public by the end of the year. 2008, responsible for 73% of the total number of cases filed by the Ministry of Information and the Yemeni government against the press in Yemen. When the protests and clashes intensified in Aden in April 2009, \"Al-Ayyam covered the events extensively, and pictures of blood and injuries were on the cover of the newspaper for days.\" President Ali Abdullah Saleh sent delegations to the newspaper, asking them to reduce the severity of their coverage, and to stop using pictures of the injured and bleeding blood. On May 12, 2009, security forces launched an attack on the headquarters of Al-Ayyam newspaper in Aden.\n\nRadio and television\nRadio Aden was established on August 17, 1954, under the name \"Aden Radio Station\". It is currently broadcast in two periods, morning and evening. The British occupation opened the Aden Channel on September 11, 1964, following the revolution of October 14, 1963. Television transmission was limited to covering populated neighbourhoods in the city of Aden, especially where soldiers and families of the British forces were present. In January 1979, the television headquarters moved to the \"Radio and Television Building\" in Tawahi. Which was prepared, and at that time the broadcast was in black and white, and in March 1981 the gradual transition to colour broadcasting began, and in June 1981 the channel began broadcasting via satellite. After the Yemeni unification on May 22, 1990, Aden Channel was the second official channel of Yemeni TV.\n\nNotable people\nSabah al-Alwani - first woman member of Yemen's Supreme Judicial Council\nMukesh Ambani (born 1957) - businessman\nAmr Gamal (born 1983) - film and theatre director, producer, and writer\nEddie Izzard (born 1962) - comedian\nShafiqa Zawqari (born 1942) - author\n\nSee also\nHadhramaut Mountains\nHistory of the Jews in Aden\nMilitary history of Britain\nPostage stamps and postal history of Aden\nYemen Ports Authority\n\nFootnotes\nReferences\nGarston, J. \"Aden: The First Hundred Years,\" History Today (March 1965) 15#3 pp 147–158. covers 1839 to 1939.\nNorris, H.T.; Penhey, F.W.

          "summary": "Aden (Arabic: عَدَنْ‎, romanized: ʿAdan; IPA: [ʕa.dan]) is a port city located in Yemen in the southern part of the Arabian peninsula, on the north coast of the Gulf of Aden, positioned near the eastern approach to the Red Sea. It is situated approximately 170 km (110 mi) east of the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. With its strategic location on the coastline, Aden serves as a gateway between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, making it a crucial maritime hub connecting Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. As of September 2025, Aden has a population of approximately  1,154,000 residents, making it one of the largest cities in Yemen.\nAden is the capital and principal part of Aden Governorate, encompassing eight districts. During the colonial period, the name Aden referred to the area along the north coast of the gulf, encompassing Tawahi, Mualla, Crater, and much of Khor Maksar district. The western harbour peninsula, known as Little Aden, now falls within the Al Buraiqeh district.\n\nBefore gaining independence, Aden comprised distinct sectors: Crater, the original port; Ma'alla, the modern port; Tawahi, formerly \"Steamer Point\"; and Gold Mohur resorts. Khormaksar, on the isthmus connecting Aden to the mainland, hosts diplomatic missions, Aden University's main offices, and Aden International Airport. On the mainland, sectors include Sheikh Othman, an old oasis area; Al-Mansura, a British-planned town; and Madinat ash-Sha'b (formerly Madinat al-Ittihad), the former capital of the South Arabian Federation, now housing a large power/desalination facility and additional Aden University faculties.\nAden encloses the eastern side of a vast, natural harbour that constitutes the modern port. Little Aden was developed as the site of the oil refinery and tanker port. Both were established and operated by British Petroleum until they were turned over to South Yemeni government ownership and control in 1978.\nAden used to be the capital of South Yemen until its unity with North Yemen on 22 May 1990. It is currently the temporary capital of Yemen since the 2014 Coup d'état, hosting some members of the Cabinet of Yemen mainly in al-Maashiq Palace. It is also the seat of the secessionist Southern Transitional Council, which exercises control over the city.",

          "content": "عَدَن هي مدينه يمنيه تقع على ساحل خليج عدن وبحر العرب في جنوب البلاد، وهي العاصمه الاقتصاديه لليمن، وثاني اهم مدينه يمنيه بعد صنعاء، شهدت عدن احداثاً تاريخيه هامه، وعرفت بانها عين اليمن. يبلغ عدد سكانها نحو 589,419 نسمه حسب تعداد اليمن في 2004 اعتبارًا من عام 2023، بلغ عدد سكان مدينه عدن حوالي 1,080,000 نسمه، مما يجعلها واحده من اكبر المدن في اليمن، وتبعد عن العاصمه صنعاء بمسافه تصل الى حوالي 363 كيلو متراً، ويمثل سكان محافظه عدن ما نسبته 3% من اجمالي سكان اليمن تقريباً،  تعتبر اهم منفذ طبيعي على بحر العرب والمحيط الهندي فضلاً عن تحكّمها بطريق البحر الاحمر، وتشكل عدن انموذجاً متميزاً لتكامل النشاط الاقتصادي وتنوع البنيان الانتاجي، اذ جمعت بين الانشطه الصناعيه والسمكيه والتجاريه والسياحيه والخدميه، وتنبع اهميتها من كونها ميناءً تجاريًّا من اهم الموانئ في المنطقه، ومنطقه تجاره حره اقليميه ودوليه. تكتسب المدينه اهميتها السياحيه من شواطئها الدافئه ومنتجعاتها الجميله، وتكتسب الصناعه مقوماتها من مجموعه مصانع ووحدات انتاجيه اهمها «مصفاه عدن». تتكون عدن من عده مناطق هي كريتر، المعلا، التواهي، خور مكسر، الشيخ عثمان، المنصوره، دار سعد، البريقه.\nورد ذكرها في «سفر حزقيال» في العهد القديم كاحد المدن ذات العلاقه التجاريه مع صور اللبنانيه كون عدن كانت احد المحطات المهمه لتجاره التوابل التي انتعشت لمده الفيه كامله. كانت المدينه في بدايتها شبه جزيره صغيره بلا موارد طبيعيه تذكر ولكن موقعها بين مصر والهند جعلها ذات شان مهم في طريق التجاره العالميه القديم. وكانت المدينه موطن مملكه اوسان القديمه،  وشن كربئيل وتر الاول ملك مملكه سبا حمله على اوسان في بدايات القرن الثامن للسابع ق.م، وسيطر عليها،  واستطاع الحِمْيَرِيُّون اسقاط مملكه سبا عام 275م وسيطروا على عدن. وسيطرت الامبراطوريه الساسانيه على عدن في 671 للميلاد.\nبدخول الاسلام الى اليمن، كانت عدن قد شهدت فتره ركود استمرت حتى القرن التاسع الميلادي. وفي عصر صدر الاسلام كانت عدن تتبع مخلاف الجند،  وسيطرت عليها دوله بني زياد في 819م وتبعهم الصليحيون،  وبسقوط الصليحيين في 1138م استقل بنو زريع بعدن لحوالي 40 عاماً حتى 1175م،  تمكنت القبائل الزيديه من هزيمه الايوبيين عام 1226، الا ان عمر بن رسول مؤسس الدوله الرسوليه تمكن من صدهم فاحكم سيطرته على عدن، واستعادت المدينه مكانتها خلال ايام الرسوليين فحفروا الابار وبنوا المدارس وانتعشت عدن تجارياً،  وسنوا عددا من القوانين والانظمه لتقنين التجاره في المدينه. وتمكن بنو طاهر من السيطره على عدن بعد بني رسول ويصفها الرحاله الايطالي لودفيكو دي فارتيما بانها من اقوى المدن المشاهده على مستوى الارض خلال ايام الطاهريين. وتمكّن الملك الظافر عامر بن عبد الوهاب من صدِّ البرتغاليين عن عدن. ومن ثم سقطت الدوله الطاهريه وبقيت سيطرتهم على عدن. وبعد ذلك سيطرت الدوله العثمانيه على المدينه عام 1538. كان هدف العثمانيين منصباً على منع البرتغاليين من السيطره على عدن فشهدت المدينه اياماً عصيبه بالاضافه لحقيقه ان ميناء المخاء اكتسب اهميه اكبر على حساب عدن خلال القرن السادس عشر. فانخفض تعداد المدينه وتحولت الى قريه صغيره بتعداد لا يتجاوز 600 نسمه. بينما كان تعدادها يقارب الثمانين الف نسمه ايام الدوله الرسوليه.\nاحتلت بريطانيا مدينه عدن في يناير 1839،  وانتعشت عدن من جديد بعد ثلاثمائه سنه من الركود واستوطنها تجار يهود وفرس وهنود واعتمد الانجليز على تقسيم صارم بين المدينه والريف. وخلال اربعينيات وخمسينيات القرن العشرين، اصبحت عدن احد اكثر موانئ العالم نشاطاً، بل كانت الثانيه في الترتيب بعد نيويورك. وبقيام ثوره 14 اكتوبر عام 1963،  اعلنت بريطانيا انها ستخرج من عدن عام 1968 وهو ما فجّر اعمال العنف بين فصائل ما سُمّي بالـ«مقاومه» لاحتكار تقرير المصير عقب خروج الانجليز. وكان للجبهه القوميه للتحرير بقياده قحطان محمد الشعبي اليد العليا قبل خروج الانجليز من عدن عام 1967. وقيام جمهوريه اليمن الجنوبيه الشعبيه برئاسه قحطان الشعبي واتخذت عدن عاصمه للدوله.\nقامت الحركه التصحيحيه باعتقال الرئيس قحطان الشعبي وادخلت العامل الايديولوجي الماركسي في جمهوريه اليمن الجنوبيه الشعبيه وغيّرت اسمها الى جمهوريه اليمن الديمقراطيه الشعبيه وبداوا بتاميم قطاعات واسعه من الاقتصاد وبحلول عام 1974 وضع القاده الشباب الجدد اول خطه خمسيه لجميع المحافظات الجنوبيه. كان ميناء عدن مصدر الدخل القومي الاكبر لجمهوريه اليمن الجنوبي، في يناير 1986 تمزقت عدن بسبب تناحر فصيلين في الحزب الاشتراكي اليمني التي ادت لاندلاع الحرب الاهليه في 1986.\nوقُصِفت مدينه عدن خلال الحرب من البر والجو، في 1990 قامت الوحده اليمنيه واُعتبر علي سالم البيض نائباً لعلي عبد الله صالح. بعد اربعه سنوات، قامت حرب صيف 1994 واستعادت القوات الحكوميه السيطره على المدينه، اعقب ذلك عمليات نهب منظمه. وظلت عدن في حاله ركود سياسي لـ 25 عاماً حتى لجوء الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي اليها، ومباشره اعماله منها، ونقلت بعض السفارات العربيه والاجنبيه الى عدن،  التي اعلن الرئيس هادي انها عاصمه مؤقته لليمن في 7 مارس 2015،  بدلا من صنعاء التي وصفها بالمحتله من الحوثيين. الا ان هذا القرار لم يكن سوى اعلانًا رمزيًا حيث ان تغيير العاصمه في اليمن يتطلب تعديل الدستور، والذي ما يزال ينص على ان الاخيره لا تزال هي العاصمه.\n\nالتسميه\nعدن هي موطن ومقام للسفن وكلمه عدن تعني اقام بالمكان فكلمه «عادن» تعني مقيم ويقال «عدن البلد» اي توطن البلد.، ومن اقوال الجغرافيين عن المدينه:\n\nقال ياقوت الحموي: «هي مدينه مشهوره على ساحل بحر الهند من ناحيه اليمن ردئه لا ماء بها ولا مرعى وشربهم من عين بينها وبين عدن مسيره نحو اليوم وهو مع ذلك ردئ الا ان هذا الموضع هو مرفا مراكب الهند والتجار يجتمعون اليه لاجل ذلك فانها بلده تجاره، وتضاف الى ابين وهو مخلاف عدن من جملته.»\nقال ابن منظور:«هي بلد على سيف البحر في اقصى بلاد اليمن.»\nقال ابن خلدون:«وعدن هذه من امنع مدائن اليمن وهي على ضفه البحر الهندي وما زالت بلد تجاره من عهد التبابعه واكثر بنائهم بالاخصاص ولذلك يطرقها تجار الحرير كثيراً.»\nوعن باب عدن قال الهمداني:«وهو شصر مقطوع في جبل كان محيطاً بموضع عدن من الساحل فلم يكن لها طريق الى البر الا للرّجل لمن ركب ظهر الجبل فقطع في الجبل باب مبلغ عرض الجبل حتى سلكه الدواب والجمال والمحامل والمحفات.»\n\nالتاريخ\nالتاريخ القديم\nعدن ميناء قديم وذكرها اليونان باسم (يونانيه:Αραβία Εμπόριον - Arabia Emporion) وتعني ميناء تجاره العربيه وذكرت عدن صراحه باسمها هذا في سفر حزقيال الذي يتحدث عن اورشليم وجاء فيه: \n\nكانت المدينه في بدايتها شبه جزيره صغيره بلا موارد طبيعيه تذكر ولكن موقعها بين مصر والهند جعلها ذا شان مهم في طريق التجاره العالميه القديم. كانت المدينه موطن مملكه اوسان القديمه من القرن الثامن للسابع ق.م  في بدايات القرن السابع ق.م، شن كربئيل وتر الاول ملك مملكه سبا حمله على اوسان قُتل خلالها وفق النصوص السبئيه سته عشر الف قتيل وتم استعباد اربعين الف نسمه وتقديم ملوك اوسان قرابين للاله ايل مقه وفقا للكتابه التي كربئيل وتر الاول تركها في صرواح مخلداً فيها انتصاره.\nفي النصف الثاني من القرن الاول ق.م، عزم الامبراطور الروماني اغسطس قيصر السيطره على العربيه السعيده وبلوغ المحيط الهندي. واُرسل حاكم مصر الروماني ايليوس غالوس عام 25 ق.م وانتهت الحمله بنتائج كارثيه وفناء الجيش الروماني امام اسوار مارب. اسقط الحِميَّريون مملكه سبا عام 275 للميلاد وسيطروا على عدن. دراسات اثريه حديثه غير مكتمله، ترجح ان الحِميَّريين كان من شيد صهاريج المياه الضخمه المعروفه حالياً بـ«صهاريج عدن» والتي تخزن قرابه 136,382,757 لتر من الماء.\nسقطت مملكه حمير في الربع الاول من القرن السادس قبل الميلاد وذكر يوسف ذو نواس باب المندب في احدى كتاباته فقد كانت قوات مملكه اكسوم تدخل اليمن من خلاله، ارسل الامبراطور البيزنطي جستنيان الاول اسطولاً لقتال اليهود الحِميَّريين ودعم مملكه اكسوم ومسيحيي نجران، دخل الاسطول عن طريق عدن. تشير المصادر البيزنطيه ان الامبراطوريه الساسانيه سيطرت على المدينه عام 671 للميلاد.\n\nالتاريخ الوسيط\nمع دخول الاسلام الى اليمن في القرن السابع الميلادي، كانت عدن قد شهدت فتره ركود استمرت حتى القرن التاسع الميلادي. كانت عدن في سنين الاسلام الاولى تتبع مخلاف الجند (تعز) سيطرت عليها دوله بني زياد والصليحيون وبعد وفاه علي بن محمد الصليحي قام ابنه المكرم بتوليه بنو زريع واستمرت عدن بتاديه الاتاوه السنويه حتى خفضتها الملكه اروى بنت احمد الصليحي. عقب سقوط الدوله الصليحيه استقل بنو زريع بعدن مستغلين انشغال الصليحيين بقبائل خولان. استمر الزريعيون بحكم عدن ولحج وابين لاقل من اربعين سنه حتى سقطوا بسيطره الايوبيين على المدينه. دارت معركه كبيره بين توران شاه بن ايوب وياسر بن بلال المحمدي وزير الدوله الزريعيه وهزم الزريعيون وهرب المحمدي الى تعز. من اهم الاسباب التي ساهمت في هزيمه الزريعيين كانت حروبهم المتواصله مع بني مهدي في تهامه وخروج جيشهم لملاقاه الايوبيين عوضا عن التحصن في عدن.\nخلال فتره الايوبيين في اليمن، كانت صنعاء وما يجاورها اكثر رفضا لوجودهم من سواها من المناطق. تمكنت القبائل الزيديه من هزيمه الايوبيين عام 1226 الا ان عمر بن رسول مؤسس الدوله الرسوليه تمكن من صدهم فاحكم سيطرته على عدن واستعادت المدينه مكانتها خلال ايام الرسوليين فحفروا الابار وبنوا المدارس وانتعشت عدن تجاريا. فقد كان ملوك بني رسول تجاراً كذلك وسنّوا عددا من القوانين والانظمه لتقنين التجاره في المدينه.\nتمكن بنو طاهر من السيطره على عدن بعد بني رسول ويصفها الرحاله الايطالي لودوفيكو دي فيرثاما بانها من اقوى المدن المشاهده على مستوى الارض خلال ايام الطاهريين.\n\nبدا البرتغاليون بالتوسع في المحيط الهندي وبحلول العام 1498 م ادركوا ان عدن مفتاحهم لدخول البحر الاحمر. فاستشعر المماليك في مصر الخطر وارسلوا قوه بقياده حسين الكردي، قدم الملك الظافر عامر بن عبد الوهاب مساعدات كبيره للكردي ولكنه تعرض لهزيمه فادحه في معركه ديو. ارسل المماليك اسطولا ثانيا ولكن الملك الظافر رفض التعاون مع المماليك كونه نجح في صد البرتغاليين عن عدن دون عون منهم. غضب حسين الكردي وتحالف مع الامام الزيدي المناوئ للطاهريين المتوكل شرف الدين وسقطت مدن الطاهريين تباعا باستثناء عدن. سيطرت الدوله العثمانيه على المدينه عام 1538. كان هدف العثمانيين منصبا على منع البرتغاليين من السيطره على عدن فشهدت المدينه اياما عصيبه بالاضافه لحقيقه ان ميناء المخا اكتسب اهميه اكبر على حساب عدن خلال القرن السادس عشر. فانخفض تعداد المدينه وتحولت الى قريه صغيره بتعداد لا يتجاوز 600 نسمه. بينما كان تعدادها يقارب الثمانين الف نسمه ايام الدوله الرسوليه.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nكانت الاوضاع مختلفه في شمال البلاد، حيث لم يعترف الزيديه بسلطه العثمانيين وثاروا مرات عديده ضدهم اخرها ثوره الامام المنصور بالله القاسم بن محمد بن القاسم الذي تمكن وابنه المؤيد بالله محمد توحيد القبائل وطرد العثمانيين. اعتمد الائمه على مداخيل ميناء المخا ولم تكن عدن بتلك الاهميه التي ولي عليها العبادله. على اواخر القرن الثامن عشر، عقد السلطان فضل العبدلي حلفا مع قبائل يافع على التمرد على الائمه الزيديه واحتكار مداخيل عدن بينهم مناصفه. تخلص سلطان لحج من الائمه ولكنه لم يف بوعده ليافع. كان الائمه الزيديه لا يعترفون بالتوريث ويرون القتال لاجل الامامه فطالت الحرب بين الناصر محمد بن اسحاق والمنصور الحسين بن المتوكل فانتهز العبدلي الفرصه ليعلن استقلاله بلحج وعدن. كان الانجليز يزورون عدن والمخا من عام 1609 بقياده السير هنري ميدلتون الذي سُجن وصودرت سفنه وقتل ثمانيه من رجاله.\nحاول الانجليز عقد معاهدات مع الائمه الزيديه عقب اخراج العثمانيين من عدن، فزاروا صنعاء والمخا ولكنهم عاملوا سفير الانجليز معامله سيئه ورفضوا عرضه. كانت الامور مختلفه عندما استقل العبادله بلحج والمدينه، فوقعوا معاهده مع الانجليز عام 1802 تقضي ببنائهم مصنعا في كريتر وخصص مقبره خاصه للرعايا الانجليز مجاناَ، كان العبدلي يريد الحمايه الانجليزيه من القبائل. قُتل السلطان فضل بن علي من قبل مسلحي يافع ثم غزا احد مشايخ الحجريه لحج وحاصرها لخمسه اشهر وحاصرها العوالق كذلك بثمانيه الاف مقاتل ولم يغادروا الا بعد ان دفع لهم السلطان احمد بن عبد الكريم سبعه الاف دولار. ثم هاجم ال فضل عدن سنه 1836.\n\nالاحتلال البريطاني\nاحكمت الامبراطوريه البريطانيه سيطرتها على المدينه في يناير 1839، بسبعمائه من المشاه وقتلت 150 من المقاومه العدنيه. ووفقاً للروايه الانجليزيه، فان باخره هنديه تابعه لبريطانيا حطت رحالها في عدن عام 1837، فهاجمها عرب من عدن وسرقوا كل ما بداخلها. فقام الكابتن «ستافورد هاينز» بزياره عدن في 28 ديسمبر من نفس السنه، والتقى بسلطان لحج الذي نفى اي علاقه له بالحادثه، ولكن الكابتن هاينز لم يصدقه كونه راى بضاعه السفينه تباع علناً في سوق المدينه، وفقا للروايه الانجليزيه. فطالب الانجليز السلطان بدفع تعويضات قدرها 12,000 دولار دفع منها السلطان 7,808 على ان يعيد الباقي خلال سنه وان يتخلى عن عدن للانجليز مقابل معاش سنوي قدره 8,700 دولار،  الا ان ابن السلطان العبدلي رفض المعاهده، وقاتل الانجليز فنزل الكابتن سميث بسبعمائه من المشاه محذراً ابن السلطان مطالباً اياه بالالتزام بالمعاهده، فرفض السلطان وقُتل من الانجليز خمسه عشر جنديا مقابل 150 عدني وكان عدد سكان المدينه حينها لا يتجاوز 600 نسمه.\n\nحاول العبادله وال فضل عام 1841 مهاجمه الانجليز في عدن بقوه تعدادها خمسه الاف مقاتل، تصدى الانجليز لها وخسرت القبائل مئتي رجل وتراجعوا. اعلن الكابتن ستافورد هاينز عدن منطقه حره. فانتعشت عدن من جديد بعد ثلاثمائه سنه من الركود، واستوطنها تجار يهود وفرس وهنود، واعتمد الانجليز على تقسيم صارم بين المدينه والريف. عام 1872، عاد العثمانيون الى شمال اليمن واسسوا ولايه اليمن وقسموها لاربع الويه لواء صنعاء، لواء تعز، لواء عسير، ولواء الحديده ولم يعترف العثمانيون بسلطه الانجليز في الجنوب فسيطروا على الضالع التي فر سلطانها الى عدن طالباً العون من الانجليز. فسيطر الانجليز على الضالع واجبروا العثمانيين على ترسيم الحدود، وذلك الترسيم هو ما قسم اليمن الى «شمال» و«جنوب»،  وتذكر المصادر البريطانيه ان العرب لم يهتموا بهذا الخط الفاصل تلك الايام،  وكان الائمه الزيديه يقاتلون العثمانيين دون توقف، فاُنهك العثمانيون وتمكن الامام يحيى حميد الدين اجبارهم على الاستسلام. ودعا الامام يحيى القبائل المحميه من الانجليز للوحده، فعمد الانجليز لتبني سياسات اكثر صرامه لحمايه مصالحهم وعززوا من المشاعر الانفصاليه.\nخلال اربعينيات وخمسينيات القرن العشرين، كانت عدن قد اصبحت احد اكثر موانئ العالم نشاطاً، بل كانت الثانيه في الترتيب بعد نيويورك. وكانت عدن جزءاً من الهند البريطانيه الى ان اصبحت مستعمره عام 1937. وبحلول الخمسينيات ادرك الانجليز انهم لن يستطيعوا الاستمرار باداره عدن مباشره، ففكروا باقامه كيان بعيد عن موجه القوميه العربيه التي اجتاحت المنطقه، فاقاموا ما اسموه اتحاد امارات الجنوب العربي، وهو اتحاد فيدرالي يشمل المحميات الغربيه حول عدن ولكنه فشل لافتقار المشيخات للخبره في الحكم،  وعارضت سلطنه لحج الاتحاد وكان هناك خلاف بين السلاطين عن هويه رئيسه.\n\nوبالاضافه لرفض السلطنه الكثيريه والسلطنه القعيطيه التي كانتا تسيطران على حضرموت وسلطان سلطنه المهره اقامه حكم اتحادي يجمعهم، ورفض النخبه الاجتماعيه المتعلمه التي كانت مسيطره على عدن الاتحاد مع المشيخات التي اعتبروها متخلفه واميه الى حد كبير. بينما كانت المشيخات تخشى اسقاطها في اسوا السيناريوهات او نفوذ سياسي محدود بهيمنه النخبه العدنيه.\nففشل الاتحاد واقام الانجليز اتحاد الجنوب العربي، ولم يستمر لاشتعال ثوره 14 اكتوبر عام 1963. اندلعت ثوره اكتوبر بسبب قتل البريطانيين لسبعه مواطنين من ردفان، وتاثراً بثوره 26 سبتمبر، وظهرت حركات مقاومه مثل جبهه التحرير القوميه المدعومه من الجيش المصري، واعلنت حاله الطوارئ (انجليزيه: Aden Emergency) في 10 ديسمبر 1963، عندما القى عناصر من جبهه التحرير القوميه قنبله ادت الى مقتل المندوب البريطاني السامي. فاعلنت بريطانيا انها ستخرج من عدن عام 1968، وهو ما فجّر اعمال العنف بين فصائل ما سمي ب«ًا لمقاومه» لاحتكار تقرير المصير عقب خروج الانجليز.\n\nبعد الاستقلال\nخرج اخر جندي بريطاني من عدن في 30 نوفمبر 1967، وكان للجبهه القوميه للتحرير اليد العليا على حساب جبهه تحرير جنوب اليمن المحتل التي انقسم اعضائها ما بين منضم للجبهه القوميه او الرحيل لشمال اليمن، فرحل عبد الله الاصنج ومحمد باسندوه لشمال اليمن. تولى قحطان الشعبي رئاسه الدوله الجديده وتم ضم مشيخات المحميه الشرقيه في حضرموت والمهره الى الدوله الجديده. تولى الشعبي دوله جديده باقتصاد منهار، فغادر العمال المدنيين ورجال الاعمال وتوقف الدعم الانجليزي وكان لاغلاق قناه السويس عام 1967 دوراً هاماً في اقتصاد الدوله فقد قلل عدد السفن العابره لعدن بنسبه 75%.\nقسمت الدوله الجديده لست محافظات في 11 ديسمبر 1967، وذلك لانهاء لمظاهر القبليه في الدوله وتجاهل الحدود القبليه بين المشيخات البائده. وفي 20 مارس 1968 عزل قحطان كل القيادات اليساريه من الحكومه وعضويه الحزب وتمكن من اخماد تمرد قادته فصائل يساريه في الجيش من شهر مايو نفس العام، وواجه تمردات جديده من اطراف يساريه في شهور يوليو، اغسطس وديسمبر من 1968. ذلك ان كل الدول العربيه استقبلت الجبهه القوميه للتحرير استقبالاً بارداً، فانظمه مثل مصر ارادوا دمج الجبهه القوميه مع جبهه تحرير جنوب اليمن المحتل،  حيث كان القسم اليساري اكثر عدداً من انصار قحطان الشعبي، واراد هؤلاء نظاما يقود الجموع ويواجه التحديات الكبيره التي تواجه الدوله الجديده اهمها افلاس الخزينه.\nقام قحطان الشعبي بفصل وزير الداخليه محمد علي هيثم في 16 يونيو 1969، ولكن الاخير بعلاقاته مع القبائل والجيش، اعاد تجميع القوى اليساريه التي فرقها الرئيس قحطان الشعبي، وتمكنوا من اعتقاله ووضعه رهن الاقامه الجبريه في 22 يونيو من نفس العام،  وشُكِّلَت لجنه رئاسيه من خمسه اشخاص، سالم رُبيِّع علي الذي اصبح رئيساً ومحمد صالح العولقي وعلي عنتر وعبد الفتاح اسماعيل ومحمد علي هيثم الذي اصبح رئيسا للوزراء. واتخذت هذه المجموعه خطاً يسارياً متطرفاً، فاعلنت تاييدها للفلسطينيين ولثوره ظفار وقوت علاقتها مع الاتحاد السوفيتي، فقطعت المانيا الغربيه علاقتها بالدوله لاعترافها بالمانيا الشرقيه وقطعت الولايات المتحده علاقتها كذلك في اكتوبر عام 1969، وقامت القوى الجديده باصدار دستور جديد، تاميم البنوك الاجنبيه وشركات التامين وغيروا اسم الدوله الى جمهوريه اليمن الديمقراطيه الشعبيه تماشيا مع منهج الماركسيه اللينينيه الذي انتهجوه. وتم تاسيس اقتصاد مخطط مركزيا. وكان ميناء عدن مصدر الدخل القومي الاكبر لجمهوريه اليمن الجنوبي، ولكن اغلاق قناه السويس من قبل اسرائيل - عندما ضربت سفينه داخل المياه المصريه الاقليميه - قلل من النشاطات التجاريه في الميناء.\nاراد سالم ربيع علي تبنّي منهجا عملياً، فتواصل مع رئيس اليمن الشمالي ابراهيم الحمدي وكان يريد علاقات طبيعيه مع الدول الغربيه، وفي عهده تاسست العلاقات بين اليمن الجنوبي والسعوديه عام 1976،  كان الرئيس سالمين كما يُعرف، يطمع لمزيد من الدعم السوفييتي فعقد العلاقات مع السعوديه اقلق السوفييت ودفعهم لزياده المساعدات ولكن العلاقات مع السعوديه توترت من جديد عام 1977 عقب اغتيال رئيس اليمن الشمالي ابراهيم الحمدي،  ويُعتقد ان سالم ربيع علي دبر عمليه اغتيال احمد حسين الغشمي انتقاماً لابراهيم الحمدي. فخضع سالم ربيع علي لمحاكمه سريعه انتهت باعدامه وتولي عبد الفتاح اسماعيل رئاسه اليمن الجنوبي. وتوترت العلاقات مع شمال اليمن، بسبب دعم فتاح للفصائل المعارضه لعلي عبد الله صالح وكان اكثر تعصباً ممن سبقه ونشطت العلاقات مع الاتحاد السوفيتي على نحو غير مسبوق، فقامت حرب الجبهه عام 1978 تدخل فيها الاتحاد السوفيتي والولايات المتحده.\n\nتمكن علي ناصر محمد من اجبار عبد الفتاح اسماعيل الجوفي على الاستقاله لـ«اسباب صحيه» ونفي اسماعيل الى موسكو بعد اقل من سنتين على توليه الرئاسه،  رغم منهج جمهوريه اليمن الديمقراطيه الشعبيه وازالتها للمظاهر القبليه، الا ان القبيله بقيت حيه في السياسيين والعامه رغم تعريه مشايخ القبائل من سلطاتهم، فالمحاباه والمحسوبيه القبليه والمناطقيه بقيت في جنوب اليمن اذ كانت القوى السياسيه تستدعي انتمائتها القبليه والمناطقيه خلال الازمات.\nوبحلول يناير 1986 كانت عدن ممزقه بسبب تناحر فصيلين في الحزب الاشتراكي الحاكم، عندما اقدم حراس الرئيس علي ناصر محمد على هجوم مفاجئ على مكتب الحزب السياسي في عدن في 13 يناير 1986، فكانت تلك بدايه حرب 1986 الاهليه في جنوب اليمن. كان اساس الحرب مناطقيا، فعلي ناصر محمد من محافظه ابين بينما كان جل المقتولين في مكتب الحزب السياسي من الضالع ولحج. فقامت الويه عسكريه من تلك المناطق بقصف عدن من البر والبحر، مما اجبر علي ناصر محمد على الهرب ونزح مئات الالاف من المدنيين والعسكريين لشمال اليمن منهم عبد ربه منصور هادي. ولحق ذلك عمليات قتل وتصفيه ممنهجه ضد ابناء محافظه ابين، بتهمه انهم كانوا متعاونين مع علي ناصر محمد، فقُتل قرابه عشره الاف شخص وهاجر الالاف نحو اليمن الشمالي جلهم كان من ابين وشبوه.\n\nوشكلت تلك الحرب نهايه دوله جمهوريه اليمن الديمقراطيه الشعبيه وتولى حيدر ابو بكر العطاس الرئاسه حتى 22 مايو 1990 واندماج اليمن الجنوبي مع اليمن الشمالي وقيام الجمهوريه اليمنيه، واعتبر حينها علي سالم البيض نائبا لعلي عبد الله صالح، وحيدر ابو بكر العطاس رئيساً للحكومه، وبعد انتخابات 1993، بدات الصراعات ضمن الائتلاف الحاكم وقام نائب الرئيس علي سالم البيض بالاعتكاف في عدن، في اغسطس 1993 وتدهور الوضع الامني العام في البلاد، وفشل الدمج التام للجيشين، فاشتبكت القوات الجنوبيه التي نُقلت الى عمران مع القوات الشماليه هناك، واشتبكت قوات العمالقه الشماليه التي نقلت الى ابين مع القوات الجنوبيه، ووقعت الاطراف السياسيه على وثيقه العهد والاتفاق 1994، في العاصمه الاردنيه، في 20 فبراير 1994، لمحاوله انهاء الازمه، وادت الاحداث المتتابعه الى اندلاع حرب صيف 1994، والتحق القاده العسكريين الجنوبيين الفارين بعد احداث 1986 بصفوف القوات المواليه للرئيس السابق علي عبد الله صالح،  وساندوا جيش الوحده في الحرب ضد رفاقهم السابقين عام 1994 في الحرب على الانفصاليين. وفي طليعه هؤلاء برزت مجموعه من المع الضباط، مثل الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي الذي اصبح وزير الدفاع انذاك، ورئيس الاركان السابق اللواء عبد الله عليوه، واللواء سالم قطن الذي اغتاله مسلح قاعدي، وبعد الحرب عُيّن عبد ربه منصور هادي نائباً لرئيس الجمهوريه، وظل في منصبه حتى 2012، عندما انتخب رئيساً للبلاد.\n\nالعاصمه المؤقته عدن\nظلت عدن في حاله ركود سياسي ل25 عاماً حتى لجوء الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي اليها، ومباشره اعماله من القصر الجمهوري بعدن، واعلن هادي عدن عاصمه مؤقته في 7 مارس 2015،  بدلاً من صنعاء التي وصفها بالمحتله من الحوثيين. وذلك بعد سيطره الحوثيين على صنعاء في 21 سبتمبر 2015، وفرضهم حصاراً على القصر الجمهوري ومنزل الرئيس هادي في 20 يناير، وقدم هادي استقالته في 22 يناير الى البرلمان الذي لم يعقد جلسه لقبول الاستقاله او رفضها، وظل هادي قيد الاقامه الجبريه التي فرضها الحوثيون عليه، حتى تمكن من المغادره الى عدن في 21 فبراير 2015،  وتراجع عن استقالته، واعلن بياناً قال فيه «ان جميع القرارات التي اتخذت من 21 سبتمبر باطله ولا شرعيه لها».\nونقلت بعض السفارات العربيه والاجنبيه الى عدن،  وتمكن وزير الدفاع محمود الصبيحي من مغادره صنعاء الى عدن والتقى فيها الرئيس هادي.\nفي 4 مارس 2016، اقتحم مسلحون مجهولون دار الام تريزا في المدينه وقتلوا سته عشر شخصاً بينهن اربع راهبات. كما تعرضت عدد من كنائس المدينه القديمه للتدمير على يد متطرفين اسلاميين منذ منتصف العام 2015.\n\nالتركيبه السكانيه\nبلغ عدد سكان عدن 865,000 نسمه بحسب الاسقاط السكاني لعام 2015،  ووفقاً لنتائج التعداد السكاني لعام 2004 م كان تعداد عدن 589,419 نسمه، وهو يشكل ما نسبته 3% من اجمالي سكان اليمن. ينمو عدد السكان بمعدل 3.77% سنوياً.\n\nسكان المديريات\nيتوزع السكان والمساكن والاسر على مستوى المديريات على النحو التالي:\n\nالتوزيع الحضري\nشهدت كل محافظات اليمن تحولات هامه في نسبه سكان الريف والحضر، بين تعداد اليمن 1994 وتعداد 2004 وتمثل هذا التحول في نمو سكان الحضر، حيث تشير نتائج تعداد 1994م ان نسبه سكان الحضر كانت (23,5%) بينما ارتفعت هذه النسبه لتصل عام 2004م الى حوالي (28,64%)، مما يؤكد ان النمط الريفي هو السائد في الجمهوريه اليمنيه. وقد شهدت اليمن نمواً في سكان الحضر في المدن الرئيسه بشكل اكبر من المدن الاخرى ويتضح ذلك من خلال نمو السكان في العاصمه صنعاء ومدينه عدن والحديده حيث يمثل الحضر في العاصمه صنعاء 97,7% بينما يمثل الريف 3.3% وتصل النسبه الى 100% في عدن الا ان التحضر في المدن الرئيسيه في اليمن وخاصه العاصمه صنعاء تحضر زائف حيث ينتقل السكان من الريف الى المدينه مع احتفاظهم بعاداتهم وتقاليدهم دون تغيير ومنها العادات السيئه كما ان الهجره لا تغير من مستوى معيشه الفرد لتصبح الهجره مجرد تغيير مكان الاقامه.\n\nالجغرافيا والمناخ\nالموقع\nتقع عدن على ساحل خليج عدن، وتبعد عن العاصمه صنعاء بمسافه تصل الى حوالي (363) كيلو متراً، وتقع بين دائرتي عرض 47- 12 شمال خط الاستواء،  وعلى ارتفاع 6 متر عن مستوى سطح البحر، وتحيط بها محافظه لحج من الشمال والشرق، ومحافظه ابين من الشمال الغربي، ولعدن منفذ جوي يتمثل في مطار عدن الدولي، ومنفذ بحري يتمثل في ميناء عدن، ولها طرق بريه من الشمال يربطها بلحج وابين وتعز.\n\nالتضاريس\nمدينه عدن مدينه ساحليه، حيث تطل على مسطح مائي كبير هو خليج عدن، الذي بدوره ينفتح على المحيط الهندي، كما ان شكل مدينه عدن بشكل شبه جزيرتين ساعد هذا العامل لتنفرد مدينه عدن بهذه الخصوصيه مما اثر ذلك بشكل واضح في حدوث ظاهره نسيم البر والبحر، التي تحدث بفعل التبادل الهوائي لليابسه والماء اثناء الليل والنهار، كما اثر موقعها من السطح المائي في المدى الحراري اليومي والسنوي، ولا يعني ذلك بانه لا توجد فروق كبيره في درجات الحراره بالنسبه للصيف والشتاء.\nينحدر سطح مدينه عدن جنوباً، وتظهر المرتفعات في الجزء الجنوبي من عدن متمثله في مرتفعات جبل شمسان التي تزيد اعلى قممها عن 500م، ومرتفعات جبل احسان وجبل المزلقم في عدن الصغرى، وهي اقل ارتفاعاً من جبل شمسان، ولا تختلف مرتفعات عدن عن بقيه مرتفعات اليمن من حيث التكوين، فهي ذات اصل بركاني، وبالرغم من احتلال المرتفعات الجبليه مساحات كبيره من المدينه الا ان تاثيرها ضعيف ومحدود في مناخ مدينه عدن.\n\nالمناخ\nمناخ عدن حار نسبياً خلال ايام السنه، ويصل متوسط درجه الحراره في عدن خلال ايام السنه بحدود 27 درجه مئويه، وتبلغ نسبه الرطوبه بين 62% - 73%.، هطول الامطار في عدن بصوره عامه قليل وغالباً ما تكون الامطار شتويه ربيعيه وتندر في الصيف.\n\nالبيئه\nالسواحل\nمعظم سواحل محافظه عدن على امتداد الشريط الساحلي هي سواحل رمليه، وتمتلك المحافظه شواطئ ساحليه ومنها الساحل الذهبي بمديريه التواهي وساحل ابين بخور مكسر وشاطئ الغدير وشاطئ كود النمر بالبريقه.\n\nالجزر البحريه\nهناك حوالي 21 جزيره حول شبه جزيرتي عدن وعدن الصغرى وراس عمران، وهي في الغالب جزر صخريه تحيط بجزء منها شعاب مرجانيه غير مكتمله واغلبها تعتبر مناطق اصطياد، عدد من الجزر قائم عليها انشطه عديده وخاصه في جزيره العمال وجزيره صيره.\n\nالتنوع الحيواني البري والاليف\nتعتبر اليمن من الدول الغنيه بانواع الطيور في الشرق الاوسط نظرا لتوافر العديد من البيئات الساحليه المناسبه التي ساعدت على اجتذاب العديد من الطيور المهاجره في مواقع الاراضي الرطبه والسواحل والجزر، وسجلت منطقه عدن (خور مكسر- الحسوه) ضمن قائمه المناطق الهامه لمنظمه الطيور العالميه باعتبارها موئلاً منتظماً لاخر ثلاثه انواع مهدده بالانقراض عالمياً هي: عقاب سعفاء كبرى، نورسيه وعقاب ملكي شرقي.\nهناك العشرات من انواع الطيور سجلت في الاراضي الرطبه في عدن ومنطقه مستنقع (كالتكس)، الغنيه بتنوع كبير من الطيور المستوطنه والمهاجره، ومنها الطيور التي تتواجد على مدار السنه، ويتواجد في المنطقه العديد من الطيور منها، طيور النحام الكبير والنحام القزم، وبلشون الصخر، وابو ملعقه، والخرشنه الخطافيه وطائر النورس.\n\nالاقتصاد والنقل\nيتمثل النشاط الصناعي في عدن، من مجموعه المصانع والوحدات الانتاجيه وفي طليعتها مصفاه النفط حيث تعتبر مصفاه البترول في عدن من اوائل المصافي التي انشئت في المنطقه، وبدء في تشغيلها عام 1954م، وتتبع شركه مصافي عدن مرافق مثل ميناء ناقلات النفط، وشبكه صهاريج التخزين، ومركز لتموين السفن بالوقود.\nتاريخياً، كانت عدن محطه لاستيراد السلع من الساحل الافريقي ومن اوروبا، والولايات المتحده، والهند. واعتبارا من عام 1920، كانت عدن مركز تجاري رئيسي للتجاره في شبه الجزيره العربيه، وكان الميناء يقوم بتصدير كميات صغيره من المنتجات المحليه، الى معظم الموانئ العربيه، وكانت عدن توفر الفحم والملح للسفن العابره، وكان الميناء محطه لتوقف السفن، عند دخولها باب المندب.\n\nالنقل\nتاريخياً كان ميناء عدن المرفا الرئيسي للنقل في المنطقه، وتحط سفن الركاب في مديريه التواهي،  وتخدم المدينه بواسطه مطار عدن الدولي الذي يبعد حوالي 10 كيلومتر (6 ميل) عن المدينه، ويعد المطار المقر الرئيسي لشركه طيران السعيده ومركز عملياتها، ويعتبر المطار ثاني اكبر مطار في اليمن بعد مطار صنعاء الدولي، ويعتبر افضل مطارات اليمن من حيث الموقع وذلك بسبب طبيعه اليمن الجبليه، الا ان هذا المطار يحيط به بحر العرب من جهه الاقلاع والهبوط، يرجع تاريخ انشاء مطار عدن الى عام 1927 عندما قامت القوات البريطانيه بتاسيس مطار عسكري في مديريه خور مكسر، وبعد الحرب العالميه الثانيه قامت بريطانيا بتحديث عمراني واسع وشيدت بجانب المطار العسكري مطار عدن الدولي المعروف حالياً.\nكان «طيران اليمدا» الناقل الرسمي لجنوب اليمن، قبل الوحده، وكان مقرها عدن، قبل دمجها مع الخطوط الجويه اليمنيه في 1996.\nخلال اوائل القرن ال20 كانت عدن مركزاً بارزاً لتصدير البن الذي يزرع في المرتفعات الجبيله. وايضاً لتصدير اللبان والقمح والشعير والبرسيم والدخن، التي تنتج وتصدر من عدن. وكانت اوراق وسيقان البرسيم والدخن والذره التي تنتج في عدن تستخدم اعلاف بصفه عامه. واعتباراً من عام 1920 كانت عدن تقوم بتحليه ماء البحر لانتاج ملح الطعام، وبين عامي 1916 - 1917، انتجت عدن اكثر من 120,000 طن من الملح، وقد انتجت عدن ايضا البوتاس، التي تم تصديرها الى مومباي.\n\nالمنطقه الحره\nتمثل المنطقه الحره التي افتتحت في عام 1991، بوابه اليمن الاقتصاديه ونقطه التقاء قارتي اسيا وافريقيا، وتكتسب المنطقه الحره اهميتها الاستراتيجيه من الموقع الخاص لميناء عدن، كونه يقع مباشره على الطريق التجاري الرئيسي حول العالم ومن الشرق الاوسط الى اوروبا وامريكا، ويتميز بامكانيه توفير خدمات الترانزيت الى شرق افريقيا والبحر الاحمر وشبه القاره الهنديه والخليج العربي. وتمثل المنطقه الحره منطقه تخزين وتوزيع مناسبه لافريقيا والبحر الاحمر والخليج العربي.\n\nالمياه\nترجح دراسات اثريه حديثه، ان الحِميَّريين كان من شيد صهاريج المياه الضخمه المعروفه حالياً بـ«صهاريج عدن» والتي تخزن قرابه 13,638,2757 لتر من الماء.\n\nاهم المؤشرات الرئيسيه لمدينه عدن:\n\nالتقسيم الاداري\nتقسم الجمهوريه اليمنيه ادارياً في اطار نظام السلطه المحليه الى 21 محافظه ، بما فيها محافظه عدن، وتقسم العاصمه الاقتصاديه عدن الى ثمانيه مديريات كالتالي:\n\nالمديريات\nالخدمات العامه\nالتعليم\nيوجد في عدن 95 مدرسه منها 13 روضه اطفال، و82 مدرسه للتعليم الاساسي منها 29 مدرسه للذكور و29 مدرسه للبنات و29 مدرسه مشتركه للبنين والبنات، كما يوجد 29 مدرسه ثانويه منها 15 مدرسه للذكور و14 مدرسه للبنات وجميعها بنظام الفترتين، وحتى عام 2004م بلغ عدد الطلاب الذكور في التعليم الاساسي 57,941 والاناث 48,081 وبمجموع 104,622 طالباً، اما في التعليم الثانوي فبلغ عدد الطلاب الذكور 11,029 طالباً، والاناث 9,643 طالبه.\nاما مراكز ومعاهد التعليم المهني والتقني والفني فيبلغ عددها 13 مراكز ويلتحق فيها 2214 طالب ويشمل 453 مدرس والمعاهد الصحيه معهداً واحداً، يلتحق فيه 864 طالب ويشمل 147 مدرس حسب احصائيات 2010. وبالنسبه للتعليم العالي توجد في عدن جامعه حكوميه واحده، وهي جامعه عدن فيها 9 كليات، ويلتحق فيها اكثر من 29 الف طالب حسب احصائيات 2010.\n\nالصحه\nيوجد في العاصمه الاقتصاديه عدن 15 مستشفى، منها 5 مستشفيات عامه حكوميه، و6 تابعه للقطاع الخاص، و37 مركز صحي، وتوجد في المدينه 34 منشاه تقدم خدمات الامومه والطفوله، ويبلغ عدد القوى العامله التخصصيه في المنشات الصحيه 2,825 متخصص.\n\nمناطق موبوئه\nفي يونيو 2015 اعلن فريق الصليب الاحمر الدولي الموجود في مناطق الصراع في اليمن خلال احداث الحرب الاهليه اليمنيه ان مدن كريتر والمعلا وخور مكسر والتواهي بمحافظه عدن جنوبي البلاد مناطق موبوءه بمرض «حمى الضنك»، وقالت السلطات الصحيه في عدن ان هذه الحمى انتشرت بشكل ملفت وواسع منذ مطلع شهر مايو بعد تدهور الخدمات الصحيه وتضرر منشئات البنيه التحتيه من كهرباء ومياه وصرف صحي جراء القتال المستمر في المدينه منذ اشهر.\n\nالبريد\nعرفت عدن البريد منذ 15 يونيو 1839 اي بعد سنه من الاحتلال البريطاني، برغم ان مكتب البريد الرسمي لم يدشن الا عام 1857، اُستخدم في عدن الطوابع البريديه لكل من بريطانيا والهند الى ان صارت تسمى مستعمره عدن في 1 ابريل 1937، برغم ان طوابع هذه المرحله لم تحمل اي اشاره مميزه، لكن استخدام الرقم 124 كرمز بريدي ينسب لعدن كجزء من النظام العددي البريدي الهندي.\nثم عندما صارت مستعمره عام 1937 اصبح لها مجموعات من الطوابع البريديه التي تحتوي على صور ويطبع اسم عدن (Aden) عليها، وفي العام 1939 اصدرت مجوعه بريديه جديده تحتوي على صوره للملك جورج السادس، لكن سلاطين حضرموت -الذين كانوا تحت مظله محميه عدن التي تسيطر عليها بريطانيا منذ ثمانينات القرن التاسع عشر- رفضوا ذلك ولهذا اصدرت بريطانيا مجوعه بريديه منفصله في عام 1942، ولكن هذه المره مع ادراج عباره وصور تعبر عن السلطنه الكثيريه في سيؤن والسلطنه القعيطيه في الشحر والمكلا اضافه لصوَر السلاطين.\n\nالاعلام\nالصحافه\nتاسست صحيفه العمل الاسبوعيه في 1957 في عدن، كان شعارها (الحريه، الخبز، والسلام)، ولم تسمح السلطات البريطانيه، سوى بطبع 1500 نسخه اسبوعيا، وتم حظر الصحيفه بعد فتره وجيزه.\nوفي 1958 اُسست صحيفه الايام في عدن، كصحيفه يوميه مستقله باللغه العربيه، ابان الاحتلال البريطاني، وصدر العدد الاول في 30 يوليو 1958 وكان مؤسسها ورئيس تحريرها العميد محمد علي باشراحيل، وتوقفت عن الصدور بعد الاستقلال في عهد جمهوريه اليمن الديمقراطيه الشعبيه، من ثم عاودت الصدور بعد تحقيق الوحده اليمنيه، وكان اول عدد للصدور الثاني في 7 نوفمبر 1990 بعد توقف دام اكثر من 23 عام، وفي العام 1998 كانت «الايام» الصحيفه الاولى في اليمن التي تقوم الحكومه بمقاضاتها بموجب قانون جزائي، وتبعت تلك القضيه قضايا اخرى حتى غدت بنهايه العام 2008 متحمله 73% من اجمالي عدد القضايا التي رفعتها وزاره الاعلام والحكومه اليمنيه ضد الصحافه في اليمن. وعندما اشتدت وطاه الاحتجاجات والمصادمات في عدن في ابريل 2009، «غطت الايام الاحداث بشكل موسع، وكانت صوَر الدماء والاصابات تعلو غلاف الصحيفه لايام»  وارسل الرئيس علي عبد الله صالح وفود الى الصحيفه، مطالباً اياهم بتخفيف وطاه تغطيتهم، والتوقف عن استخدام صور المصابين ونزيف الدماء. وفي 12 مايو 2009 شنت قوات الامن هجوماً على مقر صحيفه الايام في عدن.\n\nالاذاعه والتلفزيون\nتاسست اذاعه عدن في 17 اغسطس 1954 تحت اسم «محطه عدن للاذاعه». وتبث حالياً على فترتين صباحيه ومسائيه. افتتح الاحتلال البريطاني قناه عدن في 11 سبتمبر 1964، عقب قيام ثوره 14 اكتوبر 1963م، واقتصر الارسال التلفزيوني على تغطيه الاحياء الاهله بالسكان في مدينه عدن، وبالذات حيث يتواجد جنود وعائلات القوات البريطانيه، وفي يناير 1979 انتقل مقر التلفزيون الى «مبنى الاذاعه والتلفزيون» بالتواهي الذي تم تجهيزه، وكان حينها البث باللونين الابيض والاسود، وفي مارس 1981 بدا الانتقال التدريجي الى البث الملون، وفي يونيو 1981م بدا بث القناه عبر الاقمار الصناعيه. وبعد الوحده اليمنيه في 22 مايو 1990م، كانت قناه عدن هي القناه الثانيه الرسميه للتلفزيون اليمني.\n\nالثقافه\nاللهجات\nساهم دخول اليمنيين في الاسلام الى هجرهم قلمهم القديم واستبداله بالابجديه النبطيه المتاخره التي دون بها القران  يتحدث اليمنيون اليوم العربيه باللهجه اليمنيه وهي لهجه متطوره ومرتبطه ارتباطا وثيقا باللغه القديمه،  وهي ثلاث لهجات بتفرعات لهجه صنعانيه ولهجه حضرميه ولهجه تعزيه-عدنيه، بالاضافه للهجه بدويه لسكان مارب والجوف وشبوه وباديه حضرموت، ولكل من هذه اللهجات خصائص ومميزات.\n\nالموسيقى والشعر\nالفن العدني او العدنيات هو فن من فنون الموسيقى العربيه، ومن فنانو عدن القدامى اسكندر ثابت صالح ومحمد مرشد ناجي ومن الشعراء عبد الرحمن ابراهيم محمد واحمد غالب محمد الجابري وعبد الله عبد الكريم محمد وعلي عبد الله جعفر امان وفريد محمد بركات ولطفي جعفر امان ومحسن علي بريك.\nلعبت «المزيكه العدنيه» دوراً كبيراً في المجتمع العدني، وكان يطلق على الفنانين في اللهجه العدنيه «المَطاربه» اي اهل الطرب، بدات المزيكه العدنيه في 1920 حين تشكل جيش محميه عدن، وبعده الحرس الوطني، حيث كانت هناك فرق لتلك القوات وكانت تلك الفرق تشارك في المناسبات وفي حفلات الزواج.\n\nالرياضه\nقبل الاستقلال\nتعود البدايه الاولى للرياضه العدنيه الى عام 1902م، عندما تم تاسيس نادي للتنس العدني، ومقره في حي القطيع بكريتر، واسس يوسف محمد خان «نادي الترفيه المتحد» (بالانجليزيه: Recreational Club United) في مدينه كريتر، وكان يعرف بملعب يوسف خان. وتعتبر مدينه عدن اول مدينه مُورِسَتْ الرياضه فيها في الجزيره العربيه، وتاسس في 1905 اول نادي اهلي في عدن تحت مسمى «نادي الاتحاد المُحمدي»، كاول نادي رياضي في اليمن والعالم العربي. وكان ينازل فرق جيش الاحتلال وفرق الاساطيل القادمه والماره الى ميناء عدن.\nوفي عام 1924 تاسس في كريتر «نادي الحسيني الرياضي»، كما ظهر نادي ثالث في التواهي باسم «نادي البامبوت»، والشيخ عثمان. وشهدت فتره الثلاثينيات ظهور عدد من الانديه ففي عام 1933م ظهر «نادي نجوم الليل» والعيدروسي ونجوم الصباح في كريتر، وفي التواهي ظهر «نادي الاتحاد الاسلامي» (الموالده).\nوكانت مباريات كره القدم حتى ذلك العام تمارس بشكل ودي بين فرق المناطق كريتر، التواهي، الشيخ عثمان، حيث لم يكن وجود لاتحادات تنظم النشاط الرياضي. وفي عام 1934م اعلنت سلطه الاحتلال عن تاسيس جمعيه رياضيه اطلق عليها «الجمعيه الرياضيه العدنيه»، وذلك بعد تزايد اعداد النوادي المحليه، وقد تم تعيين اعضائها من قبل الحاكم العام لعدن، وكان جميع اعضائها من الانجليز، برئاسه حاكم عدن الانجليزي «برنارد رايلي» كراعي للجمعيه، ويتكون مجلس الاداره من «هيكم بوتم» رئيساً، والهندي «روزاريو» سكرتيراً، وعضويه اثنين اخرين.\nوبدات هذه الجمعيه في اقامه اول بطوله للانديه وهي «بطوله كاس روزاريو»، شاركت في البطوله 6 انديه، ثلاثه من كريتر (الاتحاد المحمدي، الحسيني، نجوم الليل)، ومن التواهي (الموالده، والباميوت)، ومن الشيخ عثمان نادي الشيخ عثمان، ويضم لاعبين من مختلف الفرق الصغيره في منظقه الشيخ عثمان، وقد احرز هذه البطوله نادي الاتحاد المحمدي.\nومن اهم البطولات المقامه في عدن قبل الاستقلال، كاس روزاريو، وكاس رايلي، وكاس باسم باصفه النار الصوماليه، وكاس ارامكو، وبطوله كيك منشرجي.\n\nبعد الاستقلال\nبعد الاستقلال تاسس «اتحاد كره القدم» في 18 يناير 1968م على انقاض «الجمعيه الرياضيه العدنيه»، واتخذ الاتحاد قراراً بخصوص الانديه العدنيه التي كانت قد بلغ عددها حوالي 64 نادي رياضي، قضى بتقليص ودمج الانديه في عدن ولحج الى 16 نادي فقط، واضطرت الانديه للانضمام للفرق الكبيره او التوحد معها. وفي فبراير 1968م، الغيت عده نواد رياضيه وبقي 12 نادي فقط، وفي ديسمبر 1968م، تم دمج نادي الاصلاح ونادي الشعب، في نادي واحد باسم الاخير في التواهي، وفي 1969م توحد في كريتر نادي الاتحاد المحمدي ونادي التضامن، تحت اسم نادي التضامن المحمدي.\nوفي «المؤتمر الرياضي العام الاول» في 1973م دمجت الانديه وقلصت مره اخرى، ليصبح عددها 7 انديه فقط: هي نادي الاحرار، نادي الاهلي، نادي شمسان، نادي الشعب، نادي الهلال، نادي الشبيبه المتحده، نادي التنس العدني. في 18 يوليو 1975م، كانت مرحله تشكيل انديه المدن، وبدايه مرحله تسييس الانديه لصالح الجبهه القوميه للتحرير، وقُرر تغيير اسمائها وتقليصها لتصبح 5 انديه هي نادي التلال وشمسان والميناء ونادي الوحده ونادي الشعله.\nفي 18 يوليو 1975 ظهر «نادي التلال الرياضي» برئاسه ياسين سعيد نعمان، كاسم جديد ل«نادي الاتحاد المُحمدي» الذي تاسس في 1905م، وفي 1976 م ظهر «الاتحاد اليمني لكره القدم». وشارك نادي التلال في «مسابقه كاس 26 سبتمبر» في 1980، كاول مسابقه كرويه يشارك فيها مع منتخبات من شمال اليمن وجنوبه، كمنتخب محافظه اب ومحافظه تعز ومحافظه حضرموت ولحج والحديده، وذلك في ملعب الشهيد الظرافي بصنعاء، وتوج الهلال بطلاً لكاس 26 سبتمبر، بعد فوزه على منتخب الحديده بخمسه اهداف نظيفه.\nكره القدم هي الرياضه الاكبر شعبيه في عدن، يوجد في عدن 9 ملاعب منها استاد 22 مايو الدولي، و10 انديه رياضيه،  وفي نوفمبر 2010 استضافت عدن كاس الخليج العربي لكره القدم 2010.\n\nالسياحه\nلا زالت الكثير من مواقع الجذب السياحي غير مطوره وتنقصها الخدمات جراء الحروب والاقتتال الدائم الذي يعاني منه اليمن فاليمن يمتلك اربعه مواقع ضمن مواقع التراث العالمي هي سقطرى وصنعاء

          "summary": "عَدَن هي مدينة يمنية تقع على ساحل خليج عدن وبحر العرب في جنوب البلاد، وهي العاصمة الاقتصادية لليمن، وثاني أهم مدينة يمنية بعد صنعاء، شهدت عدن أحداثاً تاريخية هامة، وعرفت بأنها عين اليمن. يبلغ عدد سكانها نحو 589,419 نسمة حسب تعداد اليمن في 2004 اعتبارًا من عام 2023، بلغ عدد سكان مدينة عدن حوالي 1,080,000 نسمة، مما يجعلها واحدة من أكبر المدن في اليمن، وتبعد عن العاصمة صنعاء بمسافة تصل إلى حوالي 363 كيلو متراً، ويمثل سكان محافظة عدن ما نسبته 3% من إجمالي سكان اليمن تقريباً،  تعتبر أهم منفذ طبيعي على بحر العرب والمحيط الهندي فضلاً عن تحكّمها بطريق البحر الأحمر، وتشكل عدن أنموذجاً متميزاً لتكامل النشاط الاقتصادي وتنوع البنيان الإنتاجي، إذ جمعت بين الأنشطة الصناعية والسمكية والتجارية والسياحية والخدمية، وتنبع أهميتها من كونها ميناءً تجاريًّا من أهم الموانئ في المنطقة، ومنطقة تجارة حرة إقليمية ودولية. تكتسب المدينة أهميتها السياحية من شواطئها الدافئة ومنتجعاتها الجميلة، وتكتسب الصناعة مقوماتها من مجموعة مصانع ووحدات إنتاجية أهمها «مصفاة عدن». تتكون عدن من عدة مناطق هي كريتر، المعلا، التواهي، خور مكسر، الشيخ عثمان، المنصورة، دار سعد، البريقة.\nورد ذكرها في «سفر حزقيال» في العهد القديم كأحد المدن ذات العلاقة التجارية مع صور اللبنانية كون عدن كانت أحد المحطات المهمة لتجارة التوابل التي انتعشت لمدة ألفية كاملة. كانت المدينة في بدايتها شبه جزيرة صغيرة بلا موارد طبيعية تذكر ولكن موقعها بين مصر والهند جعلها ذات شأن مهم في طريق التجارة العالمية القديم. وكانت المدينة موطن مملكة أوسان القديمة،  وشن كربئيل وتر الأول ملك مملكة سبأ حملة على أوسان في بدايات القرن الثامن للسابع ق.م، وسيطر عليها،  واستطاع الحِمْيَرِيُّون إسقاط مملكة سبأ عام 275م وسيطروا على عدن. وسيطرت الإمبراطورية الساسانية على عدن في 671 للميلاد.\nبدخول الإسلام إلى اليمن، كانت عدن قد شهدت فترة ركود استمرت حتى القرن التاسع الميلادي. وفي عصر صدر الإسلام كانت عدن تتبع مخلاف الجند،  وسيطرت عليها دولة بني زياد في 819م وتبعهم الصليحيون،  وبسقوط الصليحيين في 1138م استقل بنو زريع بعدن لحوالي 40 عاماً حتى 1175م،  تمكنت القبائل الزيدية من هزيمة الأيوبيين عام 1226، إلا أن عمر بن رسول مؤسس الدولة الرسولية تمكن من صدهم فأحكم سيطرته على عدن، واستعادت المدينة مكانتها خلال أيام الرسوليين فحفروا الآبار وبنوا المدارس وانتعشت عدن تجارياً،  وسنوا عددا من القوانين والأنظمة لتقنين التجارة في المدينة. وتمكن بنو طاهر من السيطرة على عدن بعد بني رسول ويصفها الرحالة الإيطالي لودفيكو دي فارتيما بأنها من أقوى المدن المشاهدة على مستوى الأرض خلال أيام الطاهريين. وتمكّن الملك الظافر عامر بن عبد الوهاب من صدِّ البرتغاليين عن عدن. ومن ثم سقطت الدولة الطاهرية وبقيت سيطرتهم على عدن. وبعد ذلك سيطرت الدولة العثمانية على المدينة عام 1538. كان هدف العثمانيين منصباً على منع البرتغاليين من السيطرة على عدن فشهدت المدينة أياماً عصيبة بالإضافة لحقيقة أن ميناء المخاء اكتسب أهمية أكبر على حساب عدن خلال القرن السادس عشر. فانخفض تعداد المدينة وتحولت إلى قرية صغيرة بتعداد لا يتجاوز 600 نسمة. بينما كان تعدادها يقارب الثمانين ألف نسمة أيام الدولة الرسولية.\nاحتلت بريطانيا مدينة عدن في يناير 1839،  وانتعشت عدن من جديد بعد ثلاثمائة سنة من الركود واستوطنها تجار يهود وفرس وهنود واعتمد الإنجليز على تقسيم صارم بين المدينة والريف. وخلال أربعينيات وخمسينيات القرن العشرين، أصبحت عدن أحد أكثر موانئ العالم نشاطاً، بل كانت الثانية في الترتيب بعد نيويورك. وبقيام ثورة 14 أكتوبر عام 1963،  أعلنت بريطانيا أنها ستخرج من عدن عام 1968 وهو ما فجّر أعمال العنف بين فصائل ما سُمّي بالـ«مقاومة» لاحتكار تقرير المصير عقب خروج الإنجليز. وكان للجبهة القومية للتحرير بقيادة قحطان محمد الشعبي اليد العليا قبل خروج الإنجليز من عدن عام 1967. وقيام جمهورية اليمن الجنوبية الشعبية برئاسة قحطان الشعبي واتخذت عدن عاصمة للدولة.\nقامت الحركة التصحيحية باعتقال الرئيس قحطان الشعبي وأدخلت العامل الأيديولوجي الماركسي في جمهورية اليمن الجنوبية الشعبية وغيّرت اسمها إلى جمهورية اليمن الديمقراطية الشعبية وبدأوا بتأميم قطاعات واسعة من الاقتصاد وبحلول عام 1974 وضع القادة الشباب الجدد أول خطة خمسية لجميع المحافظات الجنوبية. كان ميناء عدن مصدر الدخل القومي الأكبر لجمهورية اليمن الجنوبي، في يناير 1986 تمزقت عدن بسبب تناحر فصيلين في الحزب الاشتراكي اليمني التي أدت لاندلاع الحرب الأهلية في 1986.\nوقُصِفت مدينة عدن خلال الحرب من البر والجو، في 1990 قامت الوحدة اليمنية واُعتبر علي سالم البيض نائباً لعلي عبد الله صالح. بعد أربعة سنوات، قامت حرب صيف 1994 واستعادت القوات الحكومية السيطرة على المدينة، أعقب ذلك عمليات نهب منظمة. وظلت عدن في حالة ركود سياسي لـ 25 عاماً حتى لجوء الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي إليها، ومباشرة أعماله منها، ونقلت بعض السفارات العربية والأجنبية إلى عدن،  التي أعلن الرئيس هادي أنها عاصمة مؤقتة لليمن في 7 مارس 2015،  بدلا من صنعاء التي وصفها بالمحتلة من الحوثيين. إلا أن هذا القرار لم يكن سوى إعلانًا رمزيًا حيث أن تغيير العاصمة في اليمن يتطلب تعديل الدستور، والذي ما يزال ينص على أن الأخيرة لا تزال هي العاصمة.",

          "content": "The Cisterns of Tawila, or the Tawila Tanks, is a historic site in Aden, Yemen designed to collect and store the rain that flows down from the Shamsan massif through Wadi Tawila, and to protect the city from periodic flooding. The site consists of a series of tanks of varying shape and capacity. They are connected to one another and located in Wadi Tawila to the southwest of Aden’s oldest district, Crater. Originally there were about 53 tanks, but only 13 remain following a succession of renovations, including those done by the British in the 19th century. The existing tanks have a combined capacity of about nineteen million gallons. The largest of the tanks are the Coghlan Tank at the center of the main site and the large, circular Playfair Tank, located at the lowest point, outside the main site.\n\nHistory\nThe tanks were hewn from the volcanic rocks of Wadi Tawila and then lined with a special stucco that included volcanic ash to create a strong, natural cement that rendered the tanks' walls impermeable in order to retain water for extended periods.\nVisitors to the Tanks are often surprised by the words on a plaque near the Coghlan Tank: \"Regarding the original construction of which nothing is accurately known...\" There is indeed little hard evidence and there are few reliable sources of information about the Tanks. One favored hypothesis is that Himyar, a pre-Islamic Arabian kingdom that ruled parts of Yemen from 115 B.C. to 525 A.D., started to build water tanks in the area that eventually became the Cisterns of Tawila. The Himyarites are known to have employed water-catchment tanks in other areas under their rule. The proposed Himyaritic origins of the tanks may help explain a recessed, rectangular area in the Coghlan tank that, according to the Director of the site, could have been used in pre-Islamic times for animal sacrifice (a ritual that the Himyarites were known to perform for a variety of occasions, including drought). \n\nThe Tanks were mentioned in some manuscripts after the coming of Islam to Yemen in the 7th century A.D. \"Aden has Tanks that store water when the rain falls\", wrote Al-Hamdani in the 10th century. Al-Makdsi, writing three centuries later, also recorded the presence of wells and cisterns in Aden. By the time of the Rasulid dynasty (1229-1454 A.D.), the Tanks had fallen into disrepair. However, the Rassulids recognized the utility of the Tanks and began to restore them. This restoration has led some to claim that the Rassulids built the Tanks, thereby obscuring what are, in all probability, the far more ancient origins of the Tanks. After the Rassulids, the Tanks once again fell into disrepair, damaged by flooding and neglect and filled with the rubble of successive floods.\nBy the time of the British occupation of Aden (beginning in 1839), the Tanks had been almost completely buried by debris carried down the mountains by successive floods. Sir Robert L. Playfair rediscovered the tanks and recognized their potential value. Aden had no fresh water and was often cut off from mainland water supplies by hostile tribes. Playfair hoped that the Tanks, once repaired, could provide a reliable source of water for public consumption. The British accordingly set out to restore the tanks to their original function. However, in the process, the British modified the design and layout of the Tanks significantly from their original state. With the intention of storing the greatest quantity of water possible, British engineers replaced an intricate network of numerous, small, cascading cisterns along the valley walls with a few, larger tanks. The Tanks' ability to both control floods and store water was thus hampered, and the site that tourists visit today is very much a Victorian British creation. Further, the remodeling destroyed what archaeological evidence might have been present with regards to the original site, and this, coupled with the scarcity of documentary evidence, has made learning more about the Tanks' origins difficult.\n\nToday, the cisterns are primarily a public park and a tourist attraction. They have not been filled for at least fifteen years and do not serve the city's water needs. They may still help with flooding, although the presence of structures in the saila, or flood course, that leads from the Tanks to the sea, impedes the flow of water. No significant restoration work has been conducted on the Tanks since the British colonial era ended in 1967. Time, floods, and visitors have taken their toll on the structures. In addition, construction on the tableland above the Tanks may threaten the entire system of wadis and dams that help channel floodwaters into the Tanks. The future of the Tanks remains uncertain.\n\n== Footnotes ==",

          "content": "The Marib Dam (Arabic: سَدّ مَأْرِب Sadd Ma'rib, or سُدّ مَأْرِب Sudd Ma'rib) is a dam blocking wadi Adhanah  (أَذَنَة, also Dhanah ذَنَة) in the Balaq Hills, located in the Ma'rib Governorate in Yemen. The current dam was built in the 1980s and is close to the ruins of the ancient dam, first built in the 8th century BC. It was one of the engineering wonders of the ancient world and a central part of the Sabaean and Himyarite kingdoms around Ma'rib.\nOther important ancient dams in Yemen include the Dam of Jufaynah, the Dam of Khārid, the Dam of Aḑraʾah, the Dam of Miqrān and the Dam of Yathʾān. Historically, Yemen has been recognized for the magnificence of its ancient water engineering. From the Red Sea coast to the limits of the Empty Quarter Desert are numerous ruins of small and large dams made of earth and stone.\nIn 2023, along with other landmarks of the ancient Kingdom of Saba, Marib Dam was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nAncient dam\nThe site of the great Dam of Marib, also called the Dam of 'Arim (Arabic: سَدّ ٱلْعَرِم, sadd al-ˁArim), is upstream (south-west) of the ancient city of Maʾrib, once the capital of the ancient kingdom of Sheba. The Kingdom of Sabaʾ was a prosperous trading nation, with control of the frankincense and spice routes in Arabia and Abyssinia. The Sabaeans built the dam to capture the periodic monsoon rains which fall on the nearby mountains and so irrigate the land around the city. Some tentative archaeological findings suggest that simple earth dams and a canal network were constructed as far back as around 1750 BC, but the most reliable information dates the Great Dam of Marib to about the 8th century BC. It is counted by some as one of the most wonderful feats of engineering in the ancient world.\nThe medieval Arab geographer Yāqūt al-Ḥamawī describes it thus:\n\nIt is between three mountains, and the flood waters all flow to the one location, and because of that the water only discharges in one direction; and the ancients blocked that place with hard rocks and lead. The water from springs gathers there as well as floodwater, collecting behind the dam like a sea. Whenever they wanted to they could irrigate their crops from it, by just letting out however much water they needed from sluice gates; once they had used enough they would close the gates again as they pleased.\n\nConstruction\nThe date of the first construction of a dam at Ma’rib goes back to somewhere between 1750 and 1700 BC. The earliest inscription on the dam is one placed there at the time of its construction or repair of parts of the dam undertaken by Yatha' Amar Watar I, son of Yada' El Zarih I, who reigned in 760–740 BC. The following repair was in the time of Yada' El Bayin II who reigned in 740–720 BC. Renovations were then carried out by Dhamar El Zarih I and Karab El Bayin who reigned in 700–680 BC. All repairs were minor, consisting of essential maintenance, such as removing dirt, opening water courses, or stopping up gaps. The Makrib Samah' El Yanuf II, son of Dhamar El Watar II, had his name carved into parts of the dam to mark the completion and repair of the dam.\nThe dam was composed of packed earth, triangular in cross section, 580 m (1,900 ft) in length and 4 metres (13 feet) high. It ran between two groups of rocks on either side of the river and was linked to the rock with substantial stonework. The dam's position allowed for a spillway and sluices between the northern end of the dam and the cliffs to the west. Around 500 BC, its height was increased to 7 metres (23 feet), the upstream slope (the water face) was reinforced with a cover of stones, and irrigation was extended to include the southern side as well as the northern side.\nAfter the end of the Kingdom of Sabaʾ, the dam fell under the control of the Ḥimyarites around 115 BC. They undertook further reconstruction, creating a structure 14 metres (46 feet) high, with extensive waterworks at both the northern and southern ends, five spillway channels, two masonry-reinforced sluices, a settling pond, and a 1,000-meter canal to a distribution tank. These extensive works were not actually finalized until 325 AD, and they allowed the irrigation of 100 km2 (25,000 acres).\n\nMaintenance\nThe Muslim historian al-Isfahani (whose Annals were completed in 961 CE) maintains that a dam breach occurred some 400 years before the rise of Islam, but Yāqūt al-Ḥamawī assigns it to the time of Abyssinian rule.\nAncient South Arabian sources report that in about 145 BC, the dam suffered a major breach during the war between the people of Raydān and the Kingdom of Sabaʾ, and that is the very breach that many scholars consider to have caused the Sayl al-ˁArim (Arabic: سَيْل ٱلْعَرِم, Flood of the ‘Arim) mentioned in the Quran; it is also mentioned in Arab proverbs which speak about the hands of Sabaʾ having separated at that time. The fighting between the Raydānites and the Sabaeans delayed the repair of the dam, and this caused devastating losses of crops and fruit, leading large numbers of people to disperse in search of new land capable of supporting life, so huge migrations ensued. It is still uncertain though whether it was that particular breach that caused the \"flood of ˁArim\" or not, since some migrations certainly took place in the 2nd or 3rd centuries CE, and they are also ascribed to the breaking of the Dam of Maʾrib. Generally speaking, the dam was repaired twice shortly before the coming of Islam, once by Sharḥabīl Yaˁfar bin Abī Karab Yasˁad in 450, and by Abrahah in 543. The inscriptions on the dam explain the costs of repair and the large number of workers involved.\nThe archaeology of the Ma'rib Dam shows the effects of siltation behind dams in antiquity, and measures to extend the operational life of the reservoir. The same problems of siltation encountered in the ancient dam were also faced in the construction of the new dam. Despite the increases in height, the dam suffered numerous breaches (recorded major incidents occurred in 449, 450, 542 and 548) and the maintenance work became increasingly onerous; the last recorded repairs took place in 557.\n\nFinal breach\nLocals report that the final breach of the dam had been predicted by a king called ʿImrān, who was also a soothsayer, and later by the wife of the king. According to legend, the breach was caused by large rats gnawing at it with their teeth and scratching it with their nails. In 570 or 575, the dam was again overtopped, and this time left unrepaired. The final destruction of the Dam of Maʾrib is alluded to in the Quran (34: 15–17):\n\nلَقَدْ كَانَ لِسَبَإٍ فِي مَسْكَنِهِمْ آيَةٌ ۖ جَنَّتَانِ عَن يَمِينٍ وَشِمَالٍ ۖ كُلُوا مِن رِّزْقِ رَبِّكُمْ وَاشْكُرُوا لَهُ ۚ بَلْدَةٌ طَيِّبَةٌ وَرَبٌّ غَفُورٌ، فَأَعْرَضُوا فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سَيْلَ الْعَرِمِ وَبَدَّلْنَاهُم بِجَنَّتَيْهِمْ جَنَّتَيْنِ ذَوَاتَيْ أُكُلٍ خَمْطٍ وَأَثْلٍ وَشَيْءٍ مِّن سِدْرٍ قَلِيلٍ\n \"There was for [the tribe of] Sabaʾ in their dwelling place a sign: two [fields of] gardens on the right and on the left. [They were told], \"Eat from the provisions of your Lord and be grateful to Him. A good land [have you], and a forgiving Lord. But they turned away [refusing], so We sent upon them the flood of the dam, and We replaced their two [fields of] gardens with gardens of bitter fruit, tamarisks and something of sparse lote trees.\"The consequent failure of the irrigation system provoked the migration of up to 50,000 people from Yemen to other areas of the Arabian Peninsula, and even to the Levant.\n\nModern dam\nA dam was built in the 1980s by Doğuş Group, close to the location of the old one, at the expense of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, whose tribe reportedly resettled from Ma'rib to his country, sometime during the 17th century, or in the 6th century, after the collapse of the historical dam. The opening ceremony took place on 20 December 1986, in the presence of Zayed and Ayhan Şahenk of Doğuş Group. The dam was considered by people inside and outside Yemen to have a positive effect on the agriculture and economy of the region of Ma'rib, and the country in general.\n\nThe dam is 38 m (125 ft) high, 763 m (2,503 ft) long, built of earth across the Wadi Dhana at 15°23′47″N 45°14′37″E, creating a storage capacity of 398 million cubic meters. The dam site is located 3 km (1.9 miles) upstream of the ruins of the Great Dam. The new dam, like the old, was designed to store water for irrigating the Ma'rib plains. However, the wadi bed at the new dam site consists of alluvial sand and gravel material 30–50 m (98–164 ft) thick. Seepage that emanates from this dam does not threaten its structure but results in the loss of water. As a way of capturing the seepage, consideration is being given to rebuilding the ancient Ma'rib dam, both as a functioning structure and as a historic monument and tourist attraction. The complexity and volume of work involved in this project make it necessary that several organizations work together under the aegis of UNESCO, using financial contributions from international organizations.  \nThe dam was damaged in an airstrike in 2015. Yemeni officials said that Saudi Arabian coalition forces were responsible for the airstrike.\n\nSee also\nJawa Dam (Jordan), also an archaeological site\n\nNotes\nReferences\n\"A study of the Marib dam and its sluice system (BC 115 to AD 575)\".

          "summary": "The Marib Dam (Arabic: سَدّ مَأْرِب Sadd Ma'rib, or سُدّ مَأْرِب Sudd Ma'rib) is a dam blocking wadi Adhanah  (أَذَنَة, also Dhanah ذَنَة) in the Balaq Hills, located in the Ma'rib Governorate in Yemen. The current dam was built in the 1980s and is close to the ruins of the ancient dam, first built in the 8th century BC. It was one of the engineering wonders of the ancient world and a central part of the Sabaean and Himyarite kingdoms around Ma'rib.\nOther important ancient dams in Yemen include the Dam of Jufaynah, the Dam of Khārid, the Dam of Aḑraʾah, the Dam of Miqrān and the Dam of Yathʾān. Historically, Yemen has been recognized for the magnificence of its ancient water engineering. From the Red Sea coast to the limits of the Empty Quarter Desert are numerous ruins of small and large dams made of earth and stone.\nIn 2023, along with other landmarks of the ancient Kingdom of Saba, Marib Dam was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.",

          "content": "سد مارب: سد مائي يقع في محافظه مارب اليمنيه. المكانه الايقونيه لسد مارب في شبه الجزيره العربيه قبل الاسلام تعود الى العديد من العوامل، من بينها ابعاده الضخمه والابتكار. لكن الاهم من ذلك هو ان القران الكريم قد اشار الى انهياره النهائي، ما جعله رمزا من رموز التحولات الكبيره التي شهدتها المنطقه. ووفق التقارير الالمانيه التي دونت عام 2010م، نتيجه القيام بدراسه لمده 25 عامًا، والحصول على بعض العينات المختلفه من الفحم التي عثر عليه بداخل سد مارب بواسطه التحليل بالكربون ١٤ المشع، والتي ارجعت تاريخ تلك العينات بناء وتاسيس سد مارب الى فتره ما فيما بين 600 ق م و400 ق م على ابعد تقدير، وهذا ما تؤكده نقوش المكربين \"سمه علي ينوف بن ذمار علي\" وابنه \"يثع امر بين\" على الهيكل الجنوبي من السد الكبير.مع ذلك، فان النقاش حول تاريخ تاسيس السد، لم يُغلق بعد، ويشكك بعض العلماء في المعايير الاثاريه الالمانيه، حيث يرجعون السد الى القرن الاول قبل الميلاد على اقصى تقدير.\nتشير النقوش السبئيه الى ان تاريخ نظم الري المتطوره في مارب، متعدده المراحل، وموثقه من خلال عده نقوش منذ القرن الثامن قبل الميلاد، وابرز من عمل على تحسين الري المكاربه: يثع امر وتر بن يكرب ملك، وكربئيل وتر بن ذمار علي، ويدع ايل ذريح من سمه علي، والاخير قام بعمل قنوات ري في منطقه ابين، الواحه الشماليه من جنتي مارب. مع ذلك، فان السد الكبير يمثل المرحله الاخيره، وهو نتاج تراكم خبرات امتدت لاكثر من قرنين من الزمان. تُعدّ الاعمال الهيدروليكيه المبكره التي يُعترف بها حاليًا في موقع السد قد بدات تحت قياده مكرب سبا، سمه علي بنوف ابن ذمار علي، وابنه يثع امر بين، وذلك في القرنين السادس والخامس قبل الميلاد. فقد تم ذكر حفر مدخل مياه في الصخور على حافه وادي ذنه. ومع ذلك، لا يُمكن الجزم بناءً على البيانات المتاحه ما اذا كان هذا المدخل قد تم حجزه بواسطه سد يمتد عبر مجرى الوادي بالكامل، او من خلال جدار تحويل بسيط جزئيًا على قاع الوادي. في الوقت الحالي، لا يوجد اي دليل على وجود سد في هذه الفتره المبكره.\nكان طول السد الترابي يبلغ 650 مترًا وارتفاعه 15 مترًا في قاع الوادي، في حين كان عرضه عند قاعدته حوالي 100 متر. ولتفادي الاختراقات المتكرره، تم حمايه السد باستخدام احجار مسطحه مغروسه في سطحه. اليوم، لم يتبقَ منه سوى الثلث الشمالي فقط.\n\nالتاريخ\nبني السد من حجاره اقتطعت من صخور الجبال، حيث نحتت بدقه، ووضعت فوق بعضها البعض واستخدم الجبس لربط الحجاره المنحوته ببعضها البعض، واستخدام قضبان اسطوانيه من النحاس والرصاص يبلغ طول الواحده منها سته عشر متراً، وقطرها حوالي اربع سنتمرات توضع في ثقوب الحجاره فتصبح كالمسمار فيتم دمجها بصخره مطابقه لها وذلك ليتمكن من الثبات امام خطر الزلازل والسيول العنيفه. حسب التنقيبات الاثريه، فان السد تعرض لاربعه انهيارات على الاقل، اخرها كان في العام 575. ولم تبذل جهود لترميمه من ذلك الحين بعد لغياب حكومه مركزيه واضطراب الامن في البلاد وتدخل القوى الاجنبيه (الفرس) واستقلال زعماء القبائل باقطاعياتهم.\n\nبناء السد القديم\nهناك اختلاف بين العلماء حول مرحله بناء سد مارب العظيم، ووفق ابحاث اثريه حديثه قام بها المعهد الالماني للاثار  عام 2010م، عثر على سته عينات كربونيه بداخل سد مارب (Marib Dam) تم فحصها بواسطه التحليل كربون-14، وقد ارجعت  اقدم العينات تاريخ بناء سد مارب فيما بين 600 ق م و400 ق م، وبمتوسط تقديري 500 قبل الميلاد. كما اشارات الدراسه الى ان هناك ري زراعي بدائي استخدم في جنوب مارب يعود الى الالفيه الثالثه ق م في عصر ما قبل السبئيين.الا ان السد الشهير (Marib Dam) نفسه يعود الى النصف الثاني من الالفيه الاولى قبل الميلاد على ابعد تقدير، وفق متوسط ثلاثه عينات من الفحم عثر عليها في سد مارب بواسطه كربون-14، وجاء جدول دراسه سد مارب كالاتي:\n\nبقى سد مارب صامدا يؤدي عمله حتى الربع الثالث من القرن السادس الميلادي، وتعرض السد لعده تصدعات ولكن نهايته كانت في العام 575 بعد الميلاد لغياب حكومه مركزيه واضطراب الامن في البلاد وتدخل القوى الاجنبيه (الفرس) واستقلال زعماء القبائل باقطاعياتهم.\nفي القرن السادس والخامس قبل الميلاد، وردت نصوص لمكاربه من السد، تشير الى اعمال بناء. كان يبلغ طول السد الترابي 650 متراً، وعرضه 100م، وارتفاعه نحو 15م. وبني في الجهه التي تسيل منها السيول فتمكن السد من حصر الماء وزود بثقوب او ابواب لتسمح بقدر اكبر من التحكم بجهه المياه عقب استقرارها في الحوض. اُقتطعت حجاره السد من صخور الجبال ونحتت بدقه ووضعت فوق بعضها البعض واستخدم الجبس لربط الحجاره المنحوته ببعضها البعض واستخدام قضبان اسطوانيه من النحاس والرصاص يبلغ طول الواحده منها سته عشر مترا وقطرها حوالي اربع سنتمرات توضع في ثقوب الحجاره فتصبح كالمسمار فيتم دمجها بصخره مطابقه لها وذلك ليتمكن من الثبات امام خطر الزلازل والسيول العنيفه  كان يروي ما يقارب 24,000 اكر (قرابه 98 كم مربع)  وهو ماعنى ان سكان اليمن حققوا الاكتفاء الذاتي من ناحيه احتياجهم للماء والغذاء، فالماء الناتج عن السد القديم كان يكفيهم للزراعه واطعام مواشيهم.\nويعتبر سد مارب من ارقى السدود من الناحيه الهندسيه. وقد قام المهندسون بمعاينه طبيعه الارض قبل انشاء السد، ثم بنوا عليها المخطط الهندسي الذي هو عباره عن حائط حجري ضخم اقيم في مربط الدم عند مخرج السيل من الوادي، وبني على زاويه منفرجه، ممتدًا من الجنوب الى الشمال مسافه ستمائه وخمسين مترًا، وله فتحات وابواب تُفتح وتُغلق حسب الحاجه لمرور الماء منها المسايل المتصله بها لارواء الحقول والبساتين والمزارع.\n\nتهدم السد\nاول ثغره موثقه مؤكده حدثت لسد مارب خلال الربع الثالث من القرن الرابع الميلادي تقريبًا، وقد جرت اعمال الاصلاح تحت سلطه الحميريين في عهد الملكين ثاران يهنعم وابنه ملكي كرب يهامن (النقش: Ja 671+788).\nثم حدثت ثغرتان في عامي 454م و455م، اصلحهما الملك شُرَحبئيل يعفر. (النقشان: CIH 540; Gar Sharahbil A).\nلاحقاً اصلح الملك ابرهه ثغره جديده في 547- 548م (النقشان: CIH 541, DAI GDN 2002-20).\nيشير نقش لاتحاد ذو همدان الى اعمال ترميم للسد، مؤرخ باواخر العام 558م من عهد الملك ابرهه (النقش: Ja 547+544+546+545).\nادت ثغره اخيره الى هجر نظام الري، يرى باحثون انها المذكوره في سوره سبا من القران الكريم: ﴿لَقَدْ كَانَ لِسَبَاٍ فِي مَسْكَنِهِمْ ايَهٌ جَنَّتَانِ عَنْ يَمِينٍ وَشِمَالٍ كُلُوا مِنْ رِزْقِ رَبِّكُمْ وَاشْكُرُوا لَهُ بَلْدَهٌ طَيِّبَهٌ وَرَبٌّ غَفُورٌ ۝١٥ فَاَعْرَضُوا فَاَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ سَيْلَ الْعَرِمِ وَبَدَّلْنَاهُمْ بِجَنَّتَيْهِمْ جَنَّتَيْنِ ذَوَاتَيْ اُكُلٍ خَمْطٍ وَاَثْلٍ وَشَيْءٍ مِنْ سِدْرٍ قَلِيلٍ ۝١٦﴾ [سبا:15–16]\nترتب على ذلك فشل نظام الري، ما ادى لهجره ما يصل الى 50,000 شخصاُ من اليمن الى مناطق اخرى من شبه الجزيره العربيه.\n\nالسد الحديث\nفي 2 اكتوبر 1984م تم وضع حجر الاساس للسد، وفي اواخر 1986م اعلن رئيس دوله الامارات الراحل الشيخ زايد بن سلطان ال نهيان تبرعه باعاده بناء وتاهيل وتوسيع سد مارب، وفي عام 2003م بدا العمل في المرحله الثانيه من مشروع قنوات اعاده تاهيل سد مارب بطول 69 كيلو متراً بتكلفه بلغت 23 مليون و910 الاف دولار امريكي بتمويل من صندوق ابو ظبي للتنميه.\n\nمواصفات السد\nتبلغ مساحه بحيره السد 30 كيلومتر مربع، ويسع 400 مليون متر مكعب من الماء، فيما تعمل بوابه التصريف الخاصه به بطاقه قدرها 35 مترا مكعبا في الثانيه وذلك لري حوالي 16 الف هكتار من الاراضي الزراعيه، ويبلغ عمق الجسم الخرساني للسد 60 مترا ومساحته 24 الف متر مربع وطوله 763 مترا وعرضه عند مستوى سطح الوادي 337 مترا، وعند مخرج المياه من بوابه التصريف 195 مترا كما بلغ اجمالي حجم الردميات في جسم السد 3 ملايين متر مكعب، واُزيلت 200 الف متر مكعب من الصخور من جانبي الموقع وتغطيه جسم السد بصخور بلغ حجمها 100 الف متر مكعب.\nفي اغسطس 2020 شهد السد فيضان المياه من الاماكن المخصصه لذلك وهي المره الاولى التي تتجاوز كميه المياه السعه القصوى للسد منذ اعاده بنائه قبل 34 عاماً، حيث تجاوز منسوب المياه حاجز الـ 550 مليون متر مكعب.\n\nالحرب الاهليه 2015\nقالت اليونسكو انها تلقت معلومات عن اضرار لحقت بجدران «سد مارب القديم» في 31 مايو 2015، اثر غاره جويه لطيران التحالف الذي ينفذ العمليات العسكريه ضد الحوثيين، لكن مصادر قبليه اكدت لبي بي سي عدم صحه الانباء التي تحدثت عن تعرض سد مارب للقصف وتحدثت عن تعمد الحوثيين والقوات المواليه لعلي عبد الله صالح نصب منصه صواريخ كاتيوشا في اعلى السد لقصف مدينه مارب ومواقع المقاومه الا ان السد لم يتعرض لغارات جويه.\n\nانظر ايضًا\nمملكه سبا\nبلقيس\nسد القفلات الثلاث\nطاقه كهرمائيه\nقائمه سدود اليمن\n\n== المراجع ==",

          "content": "The Temple of Awwam (Arabic: معبد أوام, Sabaean: 𐩱𐩥𐩣), commonly known as Mahram Bilqis (Arabic: محرم بلقيس, romanized: Mḥrm blqīs, lit. 'Sanctuary of the Queen of Sheba') by locals, was the main Sabaean temple dedicated to their national god, Almaqah (frequently called \"Lord of ʾAwwām\"), and it is also the largest known temple complex in South Arabia, located near Marib in what is now Yemen. The temple is situated 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) southeast of ancient Marib, and was built in the outskirts of the city. Although usually major Sabaean sanctuaries are located outside urban centers, its placement was probably for reasons of religious privacy, and to facilitate the conduct of rituals by arriving pilgrims from remote areas of Sabaean territories. Nearly a thousand inscriptions have been discovered from the Temple, comprising the single most important collection of Ancient South Arabian inscriptions that provide the foundation for reconstructing an outline of the political history of Yemen in its first three centuries of the Christian era.\nThe temple was in operation from the beginning of the 1st millennium BC until the 4th century AD. Pilgrim rites began at the Harunum Temple, before moving to the Awwam Temple through a processional road connecting the two temples.\nIn 2023, along with other landmarks of the ancient Kingdom of Saba, Awam Temple was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nArchaeology\nThe oldest inscription found in the complex was in reference to the building of the temple's massive enclosure known as The great wall of Awwam by  Mukarrib Yada`'il Dharih I in the middle of the 7th century BCE. Indicating a much earlier period for the temple's construction. Yada`'il inscription was carved outside the wall, and contains the following:\n\nYadaʿʾil Dharih, son of Sumhuʾalay, mukarrib of Saba', walled ʾAwwam, the temple of Almaqah, when he sacrificed to Athtar and [when] he established the whole community [united] by a god and a patron and a pact and a [secret] trea[ty. By Athtar and by Hawbas and by] Almaqah.\nThe largest part of the temple is occupied by an unguarded yard that is enclosed by a stone wall with an irregular oval ground plan. On the inner wall of the hall were several dozen highly important inscriptions from the late period of the Sabaean kingdom.\nPartial excavation of Awwam peristyle in 1951–1952 by the American Foundation for the Study of Man that was led by Wendell Philips, cleared the entrance court almost completely and made numerous discoveries. Such as elaborate bronze statues, and the usage of the southern entrance in the elliptic wall for ablution rituals before entering the cella.\n\nGeneral plan of Awwam temple\nThe temple is situated in isolated site functioning mainly as religious sacred area. The place-name, 'wm (place of refuge), signify that sacredness attached to the sanctuary. There is a possibility that the temple developed from a small shrine into an enormous complex encompassing multiple structures associated with the temple i.e. houses for priests, auxiliary rooms, workshops for metalworkers, cemetery connected to the sanctuary, and a residential area which form the so-called protected enclave. Geomorphological investigations have shown that the Awwam temple was erected on high natural platform, making it even more impressive for the viewers.\nAccess to the complex was controlled by doors leading to hierarchical series of courtyards and halls that served as transitional areas.\nThe temple itself was oriented towards the rising sun (north-east) and consisted of eight pillars propylaeum marking the entrance, followed by large rectangular peristyle hall, and massive oval shaped enclosure with other exterior linked structures (nearby cemetery). Pillars are the most widespread architectural feature used in ancient South Arabian religious structures. The peristyle hall might have reflected the numbers of the 8 pillared propylaeum; There are 32 pillars (4 × 8) inside the peristyle hall, and 64 recessed false windows (8 × 8).\nStatues of bronze bulls, horses, and humans used to be attached to the entrance gates of the temple. Many aspects of the decoration, geometrical and figural paintings, sculptures, large and precisely dressed stones, finely carved inscriptions painted red, and beautiful ornamental friezes on the wall's exterior, were meant to impress visitors and fill them with awe in the presence of god.\n\nThe peristyle hall\nThe hall has a semi-rectangular form, with a pillared 8 monolith propylaeum entrance, topped by square tenons designed to accommodate an architrave. The perimeter of the peristyle hall is approximately 42 m × 19 m and is flanked by the end of the oval-shaped enclosure in its western and eastern exterior walls. The interior of the structure contains a large library of inscribed stone blocks and 64 vertically double false windows motif with 32 pillars made from single monolith except two that once supported stone beams.\nThe number 8 seems to reflect a sacred number, since it is used at the entrance, interior pillars (8 × 4), and false windows (8 × 8). Ancient South Arabian buildings, including Awwam peristyle hall, appears to be pre-planned according to a system of prescribed measurements instead of full use of space. AFSM excavation in the paved courtyard revealed multiple South Arabian inscriptions, a group of broken column capitals, bronze plaques, altars, and numerous pottery statues, along with potsherds that date back roughly to 1500–1200 BCE.\nVisitors of the sanctuary are obliged to go through the annex, then via a gate of three entrances into the peristyle hall. The gate could be closed if needed.\nA visible water conduit made from alabaster used to run through the hall and into a bronze basin (69 × 200 cm) placed in a room for purification purposes. The water fell on the floor like a fountain, and it fell so long and with such force that it eventually cut through a copper basin placed under and then into the stone itself.\n\nThe oval shaped enclosure\nThe enclosure is defined by massive oval shaped wall that flank the peristyle hall from its western and eastern wings, the wall measures approximately 757 m long and 13 m high, however the original height can't be determined for certainty, and it's difficult to assess its full extent.\nMany inscriptions, hundreds in quantity, were discovered in the sanctuary and nearby, only few that deals directly with the temple's construction. One of the terms used for the sanctuary was \"gwbn\"; the oracle sanctuary. The sanctuary includes a raised platform within the temple's sacred area representing primordial mound, which makes it more impressive when looked from a distance. It appears, from archeological investigation, that a cultic place was built around a wellspring inside the sanctuary.\nThe oval sanctuary is accessible from two gates, either through the northwestern gate, or from the peristyle hall one, the latter of which was the main entrance, while the former was exclusively built for priests. A third gate was discovered by AFSM, but  this was restricted to funerary rites usage as it was the cemetery entrance, and could only be accessed from the interior of the oval sanctuary.\nThe oval sanctuary precinct was the main and holy part of Awwam temple. It was an open space that contains several structures, courtyards, and wellspring. Most rituals were performed in the oval sanctuary, and according to Sabaean inscriptions, was the house of Almaqah. This holiness is demonstrated by the existence of three places for purification and to perform ablutions before entering the sacred spaces, primarily the oval sanctuary (dwelling house of Almaqah). Cleanness is emphasized by the discovered inscriptions that deals with physical and spiritual purity of worshipers. Several inscriptions attest that an individual who enter the sanctuary without performing purification rituals, will suffer severe consequences. Although no detailed information concerning the act of purification is mentioned in Sabaean inscriptions.\n\nThe cemetery\nThe 7th century BCE cemetery is attached to the Oval Sanctuary, and apparently accessed only from it. The cemetery hosts around 20,000 estimated burials during its long period of usage. That lengthy period created a large settlement of the dead, where passages and streets divide the tombs. The cemetery tombs were multi-storey structures (up to four) built using excellently polished and dressed limestone blocks. External walls were sometimes decorated with friezes and low relief of the dead's face.\nAccording to South Arabian inscriptions the cemetery was known as \"Mhrm Gnztn\" (cemetery sacred enclave). Despite the sacredness of the cemetery, no surplus of epigraphic remains for the ritual ceremonies were found in the complex. Apparently the rituals were conducted in the Oval Sanctuary Precinct, then they enter the cemetery where further ceremonies took place before burial.\nThe memory of the dead was preserved by placing sculptural representations of them on their tombs, frequently inscribing their names.\n\nPilgrimage\nThe Awwam Temple was the most important site of pilgrimage in pre-Islamic Yemen, centered around the god Almaqah. The communal pilgrimage may have lasted between eight and ten days and it took place in the month of Dhu-Abhay (corresponding to February/March), the same month that Muhammad's Farewell Pilgrimage occurred in. Alongside the annual and communal pilgrimage, pilgrims could also conduct an ordinary visit to the Temple at any time of the year. These two rites have been compared to the Islamic Hajj and Umrah respectively. \nThe Awwam Temple, like other pre-Islamic Yemeni temples was also associated with a sacred space known as a ḥaram or maḥram (“precinct, protected area, sacred household”). The temple was called bayt (\"house, resident\"). Some inscriptions call the Awwam Temple the byt ʾlmqh, \"House of Almaqah\". This is comparable to how the Kaaba is called al-Bayt al-Ḥarām, \"the sacred house\" in the Quran (5:2).\nThe pilgrimage rite to the Awwam Temple was considered obligatory in the Kingdom of Saba, to the point that the statue of the god Ta'lab of the Sum'ay tribe, the focus of another major Sabaean pilgrimage, directed its visitors to also perform the Awwam pilgrimage. The ceremonial procession appears to have begun at Ḥarūnum Temple before making its way to Awwam through a processional road that connected the two temples. The main entry site into the Awwam Temple for worshipers was through the west side of the complex and was controlled by a set of gates. Many inscriptions composed by worshipers and participants of the pilgrimage have been found, where Almaqah is thanked for allowing successful childbirth, or prayers are made for the birth of a son, or requests are made for protection from bad luck, harm, mischief, and more. The authors of these texts included both men and women. It appears that the management and feeding of pilgrims was managed by several personnel, including administrators and priests. Personnel were also involved in ensuring the safety of the pilgrims on the roads to the site. \nA number of policies appear to have been put into place in order to maintain the sanctity and purity of the Awwam Temple during pilgrimage. One was a ban on bringing animals into the temple, and any violations of this rule would have been met with fines that had to be paid to the king. Texts indicate that a requirement for pilgrims was that they be in a state of ritual purity upon entrance of sacred sites (and fines were also distributed for violating these). Achieving a state of purity was a multi-step process, facilitated by several rooms in the temple, including ritual washings (ablutions). Other Sabaic inscriptions offer information about how ritual purity was understood in Saba: certain foods had to be avoided, sexual intercourse had to be avoided for a few days, weapons (and related behavior) could not be carried, and so on. More detailed rules and regulations are known from other pilgrimage rituals in the Sabaean kingdom, especially the statue of the god Ta'lub in Marib, which might indirectly offer a better understanding for pilgrimage rites and rituals at Awwam. \nRecent discoveries suggest that a Maʿlaṣ festival was included among the ceremonies of the pilgrimage. Little about it is known, but the festival may be related to fertility or harvest, and not performing it was considered an offence.\nA few temple hymns have been found, most importantly in the inscription Zaid Inan 11. One site at the complex was reserved for animal sacrifice, and sacrifices to Almaqah were performed on the seventh of the month of Dhu-Abhay (potentially analogous to the Islamic rites of ʿīd al-aḍḥā and ayyām at-tashrīq). Several dozen inscriptions describe the role of the Awwan Temple as an oracle temple. Spaces were reserved with communication with the oracle including a shrine inside the Sacred Sanctuary Precinct. Rooms were also present in this shrine for pilgrims to sleep where they would receive dreams sent by the oracle (a practice widely attested in the Near East that is called incubation). The oracle represented the manifestation of the god Almaqah. Circumambulation may have taken place, but no concrete evidence exists for this as of yet.\n\nSee also\nBarran Temple\n\nReferences\nSources\nLe Baron Bowen Jr., Richard; Albright, Frank P. (1958).

          "summary": "The Temple of Awwam (Arabic: معبد أوام, Sabaean: 𐩱𐩥𐩣), commonly known as Mahram Bilqis (Arabic: محرم بلقيس, romanized: Mḥrm blqīs, lit. 'Sanctuary of the Queen of Sheba') by locals, was the main Sabaean temple dedicated to their national god, Almaqah (frequently called \"Lord of ʾAwwām\"), and it is also the largest known temple complex in South Arabia, located near Marib in what is now Yemen. The temple is situated 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) southeast of ancient Marib, and was built in the outskirts of the city. Although usually major Sabaean sanctuaries are located outside urban centers, its placement was probably for reasons of religious privacy, and to facilitate the conduct of rituals by arriving pilgrims from remote areas of Sabaean territories. Nearly a thousand inscriptions have been discovered from the Temple, comprising the single most important collection of Ancient South Arabian inscriptions that provide the foundation for reconstructing an outline of the political history of Yemen in its first three centuries of the Christian era.\nThe temple was in operation from the beginning of the 1st millennium BC until the 4th century AD. Pilgrim rites began at the Harunum Temple, before moving to the Awwam Temple through a processional road connecting the two temples.\nIn 2023, along with other landmarks of the ancient Kingdom of Saba, Awam Temple was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.",

However, the Minean kingdom was recaptured by the Saba kingdom in the 2nd century BC.\nThe city was the capitol of the Minaean kingdom until they shifted their capital to Qarnāwu at some time. However, and Yathill remained a sort of religious center for them.\nUnder the Minean kingdom it was an important stop on the incense route. The ancient city of Yathill was surrounded by a wall 14 meters high, much of which is still visible today; this wall had 57 towers and two gates. Inscriptions mention that the wall was rebuilt by the Sabaeans in 450 BCE. \nThe city was retaken by the Saba in the 2nd century BC.\nThe city was taken by the Romans under Aelius Gallus, Augustus's general. They left quickly, however, due to disease and poor water. According to Strabo and Cassius Dio, Gallus was under orders from Augustus to quell tribes to the north. The tomb of a Roman cavalryman, P. Cornelius, has been found there.\nThe city was taken by Hadhramaut in 242.\n\nArchaeology\nThe ruins of a temple in the southern part of the city are considered by archaeologist to have been dedicated to the god Athtar. There is a necropolis near this temple, which contains numerous grave stelae.  The temple is very typical of the Minaean style and consists of 16 columns and beams. There are also a number of ancient inscriptions in the South Arabian alphabet through the city.\nThere is another temple in the center of the city but only four of its columns are still erect.\nThe city is mentioned in a number of Minaean language temple stelae across southern Arabia.\nFrom 1989-90 and 2003-07, a team of Italian archaeologists excavated a temple with its roof intact in Baraqish. Inside they found a number of stone tables or altars with bulls' heads at each end, which are believed to have been a sanctuary to a god of healing.\nIn 2015, the city was reported as being badly destroyed when the Saudi Arabian military, supported by the US and Britain, bombed the site of Baraqish, which was occupied by Houthi forces.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nWorld66\nPhoto\nArticle in Italian",

          "title": "Socotra",
          "content": "Socotra, locally known as Saqatri, is a Yemeni island in the Indian Ocean. Situated between the Guardafui Channel and the Arabian Sea near major shipping routes. The largest of the six islands in the Socotra archipelago, it comprises around 95% of the landmass of the archipelago. It lies 380 kilometres (205 nautical miles) south of the Arabian Peninsula and 232 km (125 nmi) east of the Horn of Africa. The inhabitants of the island are called Socotrans, and they speak Arabic and Soqotri. \nSocotra is home to a high number of unique species that are endemic. Up to a third of its plant life is unique. Due to the island's unusual geography, it has been described as \"the most alien-looking place on Earth\". The island measures 132 km (82 mi) in length and 42 km (26 mi) across at its widest. In 2008, Socotra was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe island is under the control of the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a United Arab Emirates-backed, pro-Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), \"secessionist\" faction in Yemen's ongoing civil war. The STC seized control of the island following a coup in 2020, ousting the local authorities and establishing its own governance.\n\nEtymology\nScholars' views vary regarding the origin of the island's name. One theory is that the term Socotra may derive from a Greek name that is derived from the name of a South Arabian tribe mentioned in Sabaic and Ḥaḍraumitic inscriptions as Dhū-Śakūrid (s³krd). Another theory is that the Arabic term Suqutra broken down as follows: Suq, means market, and qutra is a vulgar form of qatir, which refers to dragon's blood. The capital city of Socotra was Suq as reported by the Portuguese in the 16th century, which they referred to as market place.\n\nHistory\nPrehistory\nThere was initially an Oldowan lithic culture in Socotra. Oldowan stone tools were found in the area around Hadibo in 2008. Socotra played an important role in the ancient international trade and appears as Dioskouridou (Διοσκουρίδου νῆσος), meaning \"the island of  Dioscurides\" in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a first-century AD Greek navigation aid.\nThe Hoq Cave contains a large number of inscriptions, drawings and archaeological objects. Further investigation showed that these had been left by sailors who visited the island between the first century BC and the sixth century AD. The texts are written in the Indian Brāhmī, South Arabian, Ethiopic, Greek, Palmyrene and Bactrian languages. This corpus of nearly 250 texts and drawings constitutes one of the main sources for the investigation of Indian Ocean trade networks in that time period.\n\nAntiquity\nIn 880, an Aksumite expeditionary force conquered the island, and an Oriental Orthodox bishop was consecrated. The Ethiopians were later dislodged by a large armada sent by Imam Al-Salt bin Malik of Oman. According to the Persian geographer Ibn al-Mujawir, who testifies having arrived in Socotra from India in 1222, there were two groups of people on the island, the indigenous mountain dwellers and the foreign coastal dwellers. There were large settlements of Indian traders from Sindh and Balochistan.\nIbn Hawqal, a 10th-century history chronicler, mentions Socotra in his book The Renaissance of Islam. He mentioned it as a prominent source of piracy, stating:  \"the island Socotra in particular was regarded as a dangerous nest of pirates, at which people trembled as they passed it. It was the point d'appui of the Indian pirates who ambushed the Believers there.\"\n\nMiddle ages\nIn 1507, a Portuguese fleet commanded by Tristão da Cunha with Afonso de Albuquerque landed at Suq and captured the port after a stiff battle against the Mahra Sultanate. Their objective was to set a base in a strategic place on the route to India. The lack of a proper harbor and the infertility of the land led to famine and sickness in the garrison, and the Portuguese abandoned the island in 1511. The Mahra sultans took back control of the island, and the inhabitants were converted to Islam.\n\nModern\nIn 1834, the East India Company stationed a garrison on Socotra, in the expectation that the Mahra sultan of Qishn and Socotra would accept an offer to sell the island. The lack of good anchorages proved to be as much a problem for the British as the Portuguese. The sultan refused to sell, and the British left in 1835. After the capture of Aden by the British in 1839, they lost interest in acquiring Socotra. In 1886, the British government decided to conclude a protectorate treaty with the sultan in which he promised this time to \"refrain from entering into any correspondence, agreement, or treaty with any foreign nation or power, except with the knowledge and sanction of the British Government\". In October 1967, in the wake of the departure of the British from Aden and southern Arabia, the Mahra Sultanate was abolished. \nOn 30 November of the same year, Socotra became part of South Yemen. Between 1976 and 1979, the island served as a base for the Soviet Navy. Although the South Yemeni government and president, Ali Nasir Muhammad, had denied their existence. Slavery in the island was abolished under the rule of the Yemeni Socialist Party.\nSince Yemeni unification in 1990, Socotra has been a part of the Republic of Yemen, affiliated first to Aden Governorate. Then in 2004, it was moved to be a part of the Hadhramaut Governorate. Later in 2013, it became a governorate of its own.\nSocotra was impacted by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami which damaged 40 fishing boats, even though the island was 4,600 km (2,858 mi) away from the tsunami epicentre off the west coast of Aceh, Indonesia. In 2015, the cyclones Chapala and Megh struck the island, causing severe damage to its infrastructure.\nBeginning in 2015, the UAE began increasing its presence on Socotra, first with humanitarian aid in the wake of tropical cyclones Chapala and Megh, and eventually establishing a military presence on the island. On 30 April 2018, the UAE, as part of the ongoing Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen, landed troops on the island and took control of Socotra Airport and seaport. On 14 May 2018, Saudi troops were also deployed on the island, and a deal was brokered between the UAE and Yemen for a joint military training exercise and the return of administrative control of the airport and seaport to Yemen. In June 2020, the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized control of the island in a coup, ousting the local authorities and establishing its own government. Although in 2023, the Presidential Leadership Council, Yemen's internationally-recognized government, integrated the STC into the government and recognized the STC's rule of the archipelago. Under its rule, peaceful protests against the coup and the UAE's interference in Socotra were violently dispersed, and journalists who criticized the coup were arrested and beaten.\n\nGeography\nSocotra is one of the most isolated landforms on Earth of continental origin (i.e. not of volcanic origin). The archipelago was once part of the supercontinent of Gondwana and detached during the Miocene epoch, in the same set of rifting events that opened the Gulf of Aden to its northwest. The island is culturally and administratively a part of Yemen, but it geographically belongs to Africa as it represents a continental fragment that is geologically linked to the Somali Plate.\nThe archipelago consists of the main island of Socotra (3,665 km2 or 1,415 sq mi), three smaller islands, Abd al Kuri, Samhah and Darsa, and two rocky islets, Ka'l Fir'awn and Sābūnīyah, both uninhabitable by humans but important for seabirds. The island is about 125 kilometres (78 mi) long and 45 kilometres (28 mi) north to south. The distance from Socotra to Cape Guardafui, its nearest point in the African mainland, is 232 km (125 nmi), and about 351 km (190 nmi) from Ras Fartaq in mainland Arabia. It has three major physical regions:\n\nThe narrow coastal plains with its characteristic dunes, formed by monsoon winds blowing during three summer months. The wind takes up the coast sand in a spiral and, as a result, forms the snow-white Socotran sand dunes.\nThe limestone plateaus of Momi, Homhil and Diksam with its characteristic karst topography based on limestone rock areas intersected with inter-hill plains. For centuries until recently Socotra's main economic activity was subsistent transhumant animal husbandry, predominantly goats and sheep on these plateaus. The outcome is a unique and still active cultural landscape of agro-pastoralism with its characteristic rainwater harvesting systems.\nA central massif, the Hajhir Mountains, composed of granite and metamorphic rocks. rising to 1,503 metres (4,931 ft).\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Socotra is classified in the Köppen climate classification as BWh and BSh, meaning a transitional hot desert climate and a semi-desert climate with a mean annual temperature over 25 °C (77 °F). Yearly rainfall is light but is roughly spread throughout the year. Orographic lift provided by the interior mountains, especially during the northeast monsoon from October to December, results in the highest inland areas averaging as much as 800 millimetres (31.50 in) per year and receiving over 250 millimetres (9.84 in) per month during November and December. The southwest monsoon season from June to September brings strong winds and high seas. \nIn an extremely unusual occurrence, the normally arid western side of Socotra received more than 410 millimetres (16.14 in) of rain from Cyclone Chapala in November 2015. Cyclones rarely affect the island, but in 2015 Cyclone Megh became the strongest, and only, major cyclone to strike the island directly.\n\nEndemism\nThe Socotra archipelago has been dubbed the Galapagos of the Indian Ocean due to its ecological diversity and high rates of endemism. It has 835 vascular plant species, of which 37% are endemic. Six bird species, 95% of its terrestrial molluscs, and 90% of its reptiles are endemic to the archipelago. A 2016 genetic survey of all Socotran reptiles revealed unexpectedly high levels of cryptic diversity, indicating that the island's actual reptile diversity may be greater than currently recognized. Socotra is home to several native mammals, none of which are endemic.\n\nEndemic species\nDue to the dry conditions and small size of the island, its fauna tend to be small.\nThe island has several native bats and shrews, including the Etruscan shrew, which is the smallest mammal in the world by mass. Socotra is of particular interest to ornithologists. The island has been designated an endemic bird area.\nSome of the island's most striking species are its endemic plants and trees. Socotra has many native drought resistant plants which have adapted to the island's arid environment by developing large, bulbous stems in which they store their water.  One notable example is Dendrosicyos socotranus (cucumber tree) which is the only tree in the Cucurbitaceae family. This species, which can grow over six meters high, has specialized cells which expand to hold water during wet periods.\nDue to the island's long arid periods, several endemic flora have developed an evolutionary strategy of longevity,  prioritizing long individual life span over reproduction.  These endemic flora are found in dry, low-lying areas of the island, and they grow slowly and rarely fruit or flower. These slow-growing endemic species are particularly vulnerable to climate warming, as increasing dry periods may prevent them from reproducing. One example is the Dragon's Blood Tree, or Dracaena cinnabari, which may be the most well known example of Socotran endemism. The tree contains a bright red sap which is used commercially. D. cinnabari has a very distinct appearance: its trunk branches out into an umbrella-like crown with tightly packed leaves and widespread branches. This plant structure is observed in arid climates which have atmospheric moisture. Tightly packed leaves and wide spread branches facilitate the condensation of water from moisture in the air, and the shade provided by the umbrella crown may prevent evaporation of moisture from the soil. One dragon's blood forest remains on the island. The average age of these trees is approximately 300 years. This suggests that the forest is over-mature, and indicates a decline in new growth.\n\nEvolution\nSocotra's high rates of species diversity and endemism can be attributed to a long period of isolation, as well as extreme climatic conditions which vary spatially and depending on altitude.  These conditions have created a variety of ecological niches.  Researchers have attempted to date the origins of endemic species in convergence with the geological timeline of the island, which may help discern instances of vicariant speciation after the island split off from the mainland.\nPlant life on Socotra shares floristic similarities with northeast Africa and the Indian subcontinent. The genus Dirachma has two species – one is native to Socotra and the other is native to Somalia, over 1000 km away. These species share unique traits, including eight-part flowers. Several of the island's endemic species (members of the Echidnopsis genus, for example) are thought to have evolved from a single colonizing ancestor.  Once the colonizing ancestor was cut off from its original gene pool its descendents began to diversify rapidly.\nThe most ecologically diverse parts of Socotra are its wet refugia, such as its cliffs and escarpments. These areas receive significantly more rainfall and mist than the rest of the island. These isolated areas in numerous separate areas on the island have allowed for speciation to occur. Species in the refugia are twice as likely to be endemic as species on the rest of the island. The refugia are particularly sensitive to changes in the climate, and have probably expanded and retracted many times over the evolutionary history of the island. The largest wet refugium on the island is the Hajhir massif. Incredibly, fifty five of the endemic species on the mountains are endemic to that particular refugium.\n\nCurrent ecological threats\nSocotra has been experiencing a steady decline of vegetation and floral species diversity over the past several decades. These flora are vital for the survival of endemic fauna. Several factors, such as erosion, extreme weather events, and overgrazing may be responsible for this decline.  Intensified winds due to rising global temperatures threaten Socotra's old growth forests. Traditional land management which has been practiced by indigenous people on Socotra for thousands of years, is becoming less widespread as the island becomes more influenced by the outside world. Increasing populations of invasive species, such as rats and cats, also threaten the endemic flora and fauna. Species on socotra have evolved in very particular climatic conditions, and their ranges are very restricted. This makes them highly vulnerable to climate change. Without intervention, many of the island's endemic species may face extinction, including potentially numerous cryptic species that have yet to be formally described.\n\nDemographics\nMost of the inhabitants are indigenous Soqotri people from Al-Mahrah tribe, who are of Southern Arabian descent from Al Mahrah Governorate, and are said to be especially closely related with the Qara and Mahra groups of Southern Arabia. Some of the inhabitants are African, descending from former slaves who settled on the island. The majority of male residents on Socotra are reported to be in the J* subclade of Y-DNA haplogroup J. Several of the female lineages, notably those in mtDNA haplogroup N, are unique to the island.\nAlmost all inhabitants of Socotra, numbering about 50,000, live on the main island of the archipelago. The principal city, Hadibu (with a population of 8,545 at the census of 2004); the second largest town, Qalansiyah (population 3,862); and Qād̨ub (population 929) are all located on the north coast of the island of Socotra. Only about 450 people live on 'Abd-al-Kūrī and 100 on Samha; the island of Darsa and the islets of the archipelago are uninhabited.\n\nLanguage\nThe island is home to the Semitic language Soqotri, which is related to such other Modern South Arabian languages on the Arabian mainland as Mehri, Harsusi, Bathari, Shehri, and Hobyot, which became the subject of European academic study in the nineteenth century.\nThere is an ancient tradition of poetry and a poetry competition is held annually on the island. The first attested Socotran poet is believed to be the ninth-century Fatima al-Suqutriyya, a popular figure in Socotran culture. Socotra Swahili is extinct.\n\nReligion\nThe earliest account concerning the presence of Christians in Socotra stems from the early-medieval 6th century AD Greek merchant Cosmas Indicopleustes Later the Socotrans joined the Assyrian church. During the 10th century, Arab geographer Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani recorded during his visits that most of the islanders were Christian.\nChristianity went into decline when the Mahra Sultanate took power in the 16th century, and the populace had become mostly Muslim by the time the Portuguese arrived later that century. An 1884 edition of Nature writes that the disappearance of Christian churches and monuments can be accounted for by a Wahhabi excursion to the island in 1800. Today the only remnants of Christianity are some cross engravings from the first century CE, a few Christian tombs, and some church ruins.\n\nTransport\nPublic transport on Socotra is limited to a few minibuses; car hire usually means hiring a 4WD car and a driver. Transport is a delicate matter on Socotra as road construction is considered locally to be detrimental to the island and its ecosystem. In particular, damage has occurred via chemical pollution from road construction while new roads have resulted in habitat fragmentation.\nThe only port on Socotra is 5 kilometres (3 miles) east of Hadibu. Ships connect the port with the Yemeni coastal city of Mukalla. The journey takes 2–3 days, and the service is used mostly for cargo. The UAE funded the modernization of the port on Socotra. \nYemenia and Felix Airways flew from Socotra Airport to Sana'a and Aden via Riyan Airport. As of March 2015, due to ongoing civil war involving Saudi Arabia's Air Force, all flights to and from Socotra were cancelled. During the deployment of Emirati troops and aid to the Island, multiple flight connections were made between Abu Dhabi and Hadibu as part of Emirati effort to provide Socotra residents with access to free healthcare and provide work opportunities. Currently, there are weekly scheduled flights from Cairo and Abu Dhabi to Socotra.\n\nTourism\nAmong 19th-century visitors to the island came British celebrity explorers Theodore and Mabel Bent, and their party, from mid December 1896 to mid February 1897.\nPrior to the construction of the Socotra airport, the island could only be reached by a cargo ship. The ideal time to visit Socotra is from October to April; the remaining months usually have heavy monsoon rainfall, making it difficult for tourists; flights also usually get cancelled. The island lacks any well-established hotels, although there are a few guesthouses for travelers to stay during their short visits. The island received over 1,000 tourists each year until 2014, which has since been affected by the civil war.\nTourism to the island has increased over the years as many operators have begun offering trips to the island, which Gulf Today claimed \"will become a dream destination despite the country's conflict\". In May 2021, the Ministry of Information stated that the UAE is violating the island and has been planning to control it for years, running illegal trips there for foreign tourists without obtaining any permission from the Yemeni government.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nGalápagos Islands, an archipelago of Ecuador which is also famous for its isolated geography and plant and animal species\nMasirah Island, another island with a rugged terrain off the coast of the Arabian Peninsula\nList of islands of Yemen\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nBrown, Gary; Mies, Bruno (2012).

          "summary": "Socotra, locally known as Saqatri, is a Yemeni island in the Indian Ocean. Situated between the Guardafui Channel and the Arabian Sea near major shipping routes. The largest of the six islands in the Socotra archipelago, it comprises around 95% of the landmass of the archipelago. It lies 380 kilometres (205 nautical miles) south of the Arabian Peninsula and 232 km (125 nmi) east of the Horn of Africa. The inhabitants of the island are called Socotrans, and they speak Arabic and Soqotri. \nSocotra is home to a high number of unique species that are endemic. Up to a third of its plant life is unique. Due to the island's unusual geography, it has been described as \"the most alien-looking place on Earth\". The island measures 132 km (82 mi) in length and 42 km (26 mi) across at its widest. In 2008, Socotra was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe island is under the control of the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a United Arab Emirates-backed, pro-Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), \"secessionist\" faction in Yemen's ongoing civil war. The STC seized control of the island following a coup in 2020, ousting the local authorities and establishing its own governance.",

          "title": "Taiz",
          "content": "Taiz (Arabic: تَعِزّ, romanized: Taʿizz) is a city in southwestern Yemen. It is located in the Yemeni highlands, near the port city of Mocha on the Red Sea, at an elevation of about 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) above sea level. It is the capital of Taiz Governorate. As of 2023, the city has an estimated population of approximately 940,600 residents making it the third largest city in Yemen.\n\nHistory\nMedieval\nThe first reference to Taiz in historical sources dates back to the first half of the 12th century CE, when the sultan of the Sulayhid dynasty, Abdullah bin Muhammad al-Sulayhi, built the Al-Qahira Castle. Taiz first became an urbanized area during the days of his brother Ali bin Muhammad al-Sulayhi.\nThe next historical reference to Taiz mentioned that Queen Arwa al-Sulayhi's minister, Prince Al-Mansur bin Al-Mufaddal bin Abi Al-Barakat, sold many of the country's castles and cities - except for the fortresses of Taiz and Sabr - to the ruler of Aden Al-Zari'i, the preacher Muhammad Ibn Saba, in exchange for one hundred thousand dinars.\nTuran-Shah, the older brother of Saladin, ruled the city after he conquered Yemen in 1173 CE. Turan-Shah built the citadel on the hill overlooking the old city. In 1175 CE, Taiz was made the capital of Yemen as it was incorporated into dominions of the Ayyubid dynasty by Turan-Shah.\nTaiz's expansion accelerated when the Rasulid dynasty, which ruled Yemen from 1229 to 1454, took over the city. The second Rasulid King, Almaddhafar (1288 CE), moved his kingdom's capital from Sanaa to Taiz, due to its proximity to Aden.  Taiz was said to have reached its golden age during the Rasulid dynasty, whose sultans spent lavishly on palaces, mosques, and madrassas. Its neighborhoods also teemed with schools, guesthouses, markets, orchards, and lush gardens, and the city was considered to be a center for the study of the Shafi'i school of Islamic jurisprudence.\nIn 1332 Ibn Battutah visited Taiz and described it as one of the largest and most beautiful cities of Yemen:\n\nWe went on ... to the town of Taʻizz, the capital of the king of Yemen, and one of the finest and largest towns in that country. Its people are overbearing, insolent, and rude, as is generally the case in towns where kings reside. Taʻizz is made up of three quarters; the first is the residence of the king and his court, the second, called ʽUdayna, is the military station, and the third, called al-Mahálib, is inhabited by the commonalty, and contains the principal market.\n\nIn 1500, the capital was moved to Sana'a by the ruler of the Taharid dynasty. In 1516 Taiz came under Ottoman control.\n\n20th century\nIn 1918 the Ottomans lost Taiz to the newly independent Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen.\nTaiz remained a walled city until 1948, when Imam Ahmed made it the second capital of Yemen, allowing for expansion beyond its fortified wall. In the 1960s, the first purified water system in Yemen was opened in Taiz. In 1962, state administrations moved back to Sana'a.\n\n1994 mass shooting\nOn March 25–26, 1994, a mass shooting took place in the city. A Yemeni killed eleven women and seven men, among them his wife and his mother, before he was arrested by police. When he was led away he managed to wrestle the gun from a police officer and kill another four people, three of them police officers, before he himself was shot dead. A total of 23 people were killed, including the suspect.\n\nYemeni uprising and war\nDuring the Yemeni Revolution fighting in Taiz resulted in anti-government forces seizing control of the city from president Ali Abdullah Saleh.\nAs part of the 2015 Yemeni Civil War, on 22 March 2015, the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh took the city in the aftermath of their coup d'état in Sanaa. The city became the site of a military confrontation between Houthis and the forces loyal to Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. The city was effectively under siege and the United Nations warned of an \"extreme and irreversible\" food shortage if fighting continued. In August 2015, Yemeni Member of Parliament Muhammad Muqbil Al-Himyari reported Houthi attacks on civilians in Taiz and appealed for help on Suhail TV (Yemen).\nThe 2015 confrontation expanded into a military campaign for control of this strategic city. Despite ceasefires and prisoner swaps, the battle continues to this day and the city has been described as a \"volatile front line.\" The frontline runs through the city from east to west, and journeys across the frontline that once took 5 minutes now take 5 hours. Once known as the \"cultural capital of Yemen\", the war has bestowed a new name on Taiz: \"city of snipers\".\nAs of 2018, at least seven journalists had been killed in Taiz since the start of the war.\nThe fighting has also devastated Taiz's architectural heritage: Cairo Citadel was damaged by airstrikes in 2015, and the Taiz Museum was shelled in 2016, causing its manuscripts to be destroyed.\n\nGeography\nClimate\nTaiz has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: BSh), bordering both a humid subtropical climate (Cwa) and a tropical savanna climate (Aw). The average daily temperature high during August is 32.5 °C (90.5 °F). Annual rainfall of Taiz is around 660 millimetres (26 in), but on Jabal Sabir it is probably around 1,000 millimetres (39.4 in) per year.\n\nLandmarks\nThe city has many old quarters, with houses that are typically built with brown bricks, and mosques that are usually whitewashed. The most famous mosques in the city are the Ashrafiya, the Mua'tabiya Mosque, and the Mudhaffar Mosque. Other landmarks include Cairo Citadel, which looms above the city from the south, and the governor's palace, which rests on top of a mountain spur 450 m (1,480 ft) above the city centre. Taiz is also home to one of the best-known mountains in Yemen, Jabal Saber, almost 3,000 metres (1.9 miles) above sea level), which affords panoramic views over the city.\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, the mountainous city of Taiz was known for coffee production. The Mocha coffee produced in Taiz was considered some of the finest in the region in the early 20th century. Today, coffee remains a major part of the economy but mango, pomegranate, citrus, banana, papai, vegetables, cereals, onions, and qat are also grown in the surrounding landscapes. Taiz is also known for its cheese. It is produced in rural areas like Araf, Awshaqh, Akhuz, Bargah, Barah, Jumah, Mukyas, Suayra, Kamb and Hajda and sold in Bab al-Kabeer and Bab Musa markets. Industries in the city of Taiz include cotton-weaving, tanning and jewelry production.\nHowever, since the outbreak of the civil war in 2015, Taiz's economy has been devastated by the fighting and the city's siege by Houthi rebels. Many goods are in short supply, and must be smuggled in across steep mountain roads to avoid sniper fire.\n\nTransport\nTaiz has many road connections with the rest of the country. However, as of January 2023, most roads to and from Ta'iz are controlled by the Houthis, who are besieging the city as part of the Yemeni Civil War. The city is served by Ta'izz International Airport. With the closing of this airport due to the civil war, the only way into and out of the city is via cars or small buses that goes through a longer and less serviced roads than the normal roads before the war. However, There was an agreement recently towards open roads in Taiz that will save time and effort for people to go in and out the city.\n\nZoo\nLike Sana'a Zoo, this zoo held fauna caught in the wild, such as the Arabian leopard, as well as exotic animals such as African lions and gazelles. Due to the civil war, however, many of the animals held at the zoo have become sick or died due to lack of food.\n\nNotable people\nTawakkol Karman, Yemeni Nobel Laureate, journalist, politician, and human rights activist\nAmat Al Alim Alsoswa, journalist and Yemen's first female ambassador\nReham al-Badr, human rights activist\nAbdel Karim al-Khaiwani, politician and human rights activist\nBushra al-Maqtari, writer and activist\nAli al-Muqri, novelist\nMaeen Abdulmalik Saeed, Yemeni prime minister\nArwa Othman, Yemeni writer, journalist, human rights activist and former Minister of Culture\nHisham Sharaf, Yemeni minister of foreign affairs\nZayd Mutee' Dammaj, writer\nSabri Al-Haiki, painter, critic, and poet\nAdam Saif, actor\n\nSee also\nSarawat Mountains\nHaraz Mountains\nAhmed Fadl Al-Qomandan\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Ta'izz at Wikimedia Commons\n\nArchNet.org. \"Taizz\".

          "content": "Al-Qahira Castle is a historical castle in the ancient city of Taiz, Yemen. It is located on the northern slope of Mount Sabr, which is based on rocky highlands overlooking the city. It is said that the area was originally referred as the old Taiz, and later renamed as Al-Qahira. The castle is considered as the nucleus of the city of Taiz.\nThe sultan of the Sulayhids 'Abd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Sulayhi commissioned the castle in the first half of the 12th-century and it was expanded during the rule of his brother Ali ibn Muhammad al-Sulayhi.\n\nArchitecture\nAl-Qahira Castle consists of two sections. The first section is called \"Al-Adina\" and includes gardens constructed in the form of a terrace built on the slope of the mountain. Water vapor and basins are carved and built-in one of the facades of the mountain, as well as the mansions scattered around it, surrounded by towers and parks. In this section, there are four palaces, each named Dar al-Adab, Dar al-Shajarah, Dar al-'Adil, and Dar al-'Amara. Dar al-'Amara was specially designated for the sultan and as the guest house for distinguished guests, and it was attached with the tunnels and secret passages connecting to the other palaces. The second part of the castle is referred to as \"the area of the Maghreb\", and consists of a number of palaces, guard towers, grain storage facilities, and water reservoirs. The wall of the castle is one of the most important historical artifacts of the city of Taiz, which was built in ancient times in order to contain all the neighborhoods of the old city. It is also believed to have been founded in the era of the Sulayhid dynasty and was built with complex engineering technology. Its height reaches 120 meters and a thickness of four meters, and it contained rooms for servants and guardians, some of which still remain today.\nAs for the castle wall, it connects with the old wall of Taiz, which had four main gates: Bab al-Kabir, Bab Musa, Bab al-Madjar, and Bab al-Nasr. Above the gate existed a watchtower guarding the city. The main entrance to the castle is located on the south side of the Al-Moayad area. It consists of a madrasa (school) built by the Sultan al-Muayyad in 1281, a small dome, a pond, and the remains of Sultan Al-Muayyed Park. The madrasa has a small sahn, and the park still stands until today.\n\nDestruction\nIn 2015, during the course of the Yemeni Civil War, the castle was taken over by Houthi rebels, and struck by an airstrike of the Saudi-led coalitions afterwards. The local outlet stated that the castle was \"destroyed\", although the level of destruction remains unclear.\nAccording to a UNESCO report, Al-Qahira Castle was damaged in two separate strikes: on May 10 and May 21, 2015. 30% of the castle was damaged in the second strike.\nThe castle was later taken over by al-Qaeda-linked Abu Al Abbas Brigades, who used it as a military barracks. On 26 August 2018, the castle was reported to be under the control of the internationally recognized Yemeni government who reopened it for visitors after defeating the UAE-backed Abu Al Abbas Brigades. The castle was closed for 4 years and was being used as barracks.\n\nSee also\nList of castles in Yemen",

          "content": "Madrasa and Mosque of Al-Ashrafiya or Al-Ashrafiya Mosque (Arabic: جامع ومدرسة الأشرفية) is a historical madrasa-mosque located in the old city of Taiz, Yemen at the foot of Mount Sabr in the southwestern part of the city. It is arguably the most notable preserved artifact of Taiz, given its distinct and beautiful design. It is considered to be one of the most important centers in the Islamic history of Yemen along with its complement, the Mudhaffar Mosque. It was supposedly built in two stages: (1) by Sultan Al-Ashraf Umar II (1295-6) or 800 Hijri, (2) by Sultan Al-Ashraf Isma'il I (1377-1400) and opened in 1382 or 803 Hijri. This compound can be found in the neighborhood of Ashrafiya, surrounded by a number of other locations and overlooks the Cairo Citadel. The mosque accommodates approximately 120 to 800 worshippers.\n\nArchitecture\nThe material used in the mosque construction is qadad; it's made of a lime plaster treated with slaked lime, oils and water. Since the mosque was built on top of storm drains, every part of the structure built above the foundation is made of red brick. Located in the northern part of the compound, the prayer room is the main space of this mosque. It forms a large rectangular area that spans approximately 25.40 meters east to west and is 7.65 meters wide from north to south.\nThe center of the mosque is sheltered by a large dome decorated with colorful motifs. The dome's square is neighbored by two separate hallways, each one covered by four smaller domes. In its earliest model, the mosque consisted of a single prayer hall along with eight smaller domes. In its first stage, the mosque had a prayer hall with eight small domes surrounding a much larger central dome. Also on the premises, a square courtyard can be found behind the main mosque building. A royal tomb chamber and several classrooms for the Quranic school surround the courtyard. Consequently, this creates an almost perfect square of the land plot. The south side of the courtyard contains a pair of non-homogenously designed minarets in the corners of the plot. Although they may appear the same to the naked eye from a distant glance, the minarets actually differ in dimensions and symmetry.\nThe mosque was decorated in stucco and painted ornament of high sophistication. The decorative program of the mosque is often considered a finer example than that of other mosques in the region. In addition, the qibla wall is decorated to match the exact design concept of the courtyard. It has a succession of adjacent arches with supporting columns, or arcades, that superimpose and get increasingly smaller.\n\nMadrasa\nConsistent with the Islamic architectural design of the Arabian Peninsula, domed buildings became very prominent with the architectural design of madrasas like the Ashrafiya Mosque. However, the Ashrafiya Mosque varied from other traditional models in that the library and Quranic school were integral to the structure of the mosque complex. The madrasa was mainly built of raw materials such as stone and plaster that had primarily been sourced locally. It is considered one of the most influential centers of education of the Shafiʽi Islamic school of thought and jurisprudence in the Islamic world. The school has a vast library with books in various subjects to satisfy the studies of the Muslim scholars and students belonging to the institution. Structurally, the madrasa has four accessible entrances. Above the main entrance is an inscription the reads the following:\n\nOrder of the building of this blessed school by our lord and king Sultan Al-Sayyid by the terms of the honorable king of the country and the religion Ismail bin Abbas bin Ali bin Dawud bin Yusuf God gave his kingdom and victory.\n\nTomb History in Yemen\nIn addition to a functional prayer hall and Islamic school, the mosque compound contains a burial yard where kings from the Rasulid dynasty that ruled Yemen were buried. In Yemen, the concept of tomb architecture as a part of a mosque compound began to emerge in the sixteenth century. This had been, in principle, a popular aspect of mosque planning in other parts of the Muslim world, especially in Saudi Arabia. Two of the holiest sites of the Muslim faith, Masjid al-Haram and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, located in Mecca and Medina, respectively, contain burial grounds for some of the most notable figures in Islam like the Prophet Muhammed, his family members, and his companions. Previously, in this region of Yemen, tombs and mosques were two separate entities until a dome was placed over the tomb of Murad Pasha in a mosque setting under the rule of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nImpacts of War\nRecently, the architectural integrity of this landmark has been compromised by the destruction caused by the Yemeni Civil War. An unexpected artillery shell launched by the Ansar Allah group (Houthis) and the forces of their former ally, Saleh, against the neighborhood of Al-Ashrafiya had caused significant structural damage to the historic mosque and the neighboring communities. In June 2015, severe damage to the mosque was caused when an artillery shell hit the eastern lighthouse. Although the intention was not to damage the minarets, locals have reported that the Houthis were trying to target a house nearby and missed, gravely destroying a piece of historic Yemeni and Muslim culture and society. Before then, Houthi militias had shelled the Ashrafiya Mosque several times, severely damaging the mosque and madrasa site.\nThe deputy director-general of tourism in the governorate of Taiz was a witness to this particular incident. He detailed that \"On Wednesday, June 17th, 2015, at 4:30, the eastern minaret of the historic Al-Ashrafiya Mosque was suddenly bombed.\" This incident shook the entire area surrounding the mosque and even shattered the windows of the houses neighboring the mosque. Regarding the structural integrity of the mosque itself, the minaret was visibly damaged by the shell in its middle section leaving a widely visible crack. Concerned citizens and activist groups have long called for intervention to protect this mosque as a historical monument. They have even gone on to directly accuse the Houthis of \"intentionally damaging the country’s historical ruins and of not respecting the mosque’s sanctity.\"\nThe implications of this war go beyond the worries of that period alone. Tourism, mainly for the purpose of visiting the city’s archaeological sites, has quickly decreased and come to a halt. In turn, there has been a recession for artisans of the region as tourist engagement was their primary source of income. Ultimately, the Al-Ashrafiya Mosque and Madrasa did not only serve as a cultural monument and school as its title suggests, but it also held an important role in the economic sector of the community because of its close ties with tourism.\n\nRestoration and Preservation Status\nAlong with the destruction caused by war and conflict, the mosque faces degradation caused by many other environmental factors such as seismic movements, geological instability, and rooftop water seepage. Consequently, damage by physical and chemical means as well as anthropogenic degradation have been of significant concern to locals and government officials alike.\nIn the past decade, the project of restoring the Al-Ashrafiya Mosque and Madrasa has been prioritized and made an example for the purpose of rescue and restoration measures and rehabilitation within the Third International Architectural Conservation Conference and Exhibition in Dubai of 2012. The cooperation and participation of local community members throughout various phases of the project have been instrumental in facilitating a smooth and authentic reconstruction of the mosque to its historical origins.\nAs part of the final phase of the restoration project, the southern and northern walls, eastern domes, and the basement were restored with plaster resurfacing. In the process of preparing a task force, thirteen technicians were trained on documentation and restoration of gypsum motifs. These sessions were constructed and facilitated by a local expert knowledgeable about the specifics of the Islamic art and architecture field in this particular region. Mural paintings and gypsum decorations at the shrines and the open courtyard were chemically cleaned to more than fifty percent of their original state. Also, the central dome of the mosque, along with the wall of the prayer hall, were mechanically cleaned and consolidated up to sixty-five percent of their original state. In order to update the functionality of the structure, electrical wiring was installed throughout all parts of the premises besides the primary prayer hall. In July 2014, restoration efforts on the mosque were considered complete.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of mosques in Yemen",

It is arguably the most notable preserved artifact of Taiz, given its distinct and beautiful design. It is considered to be one of the most important centers in the Islamic history of Yemen along with its complement, the Mudhaffar Mosque. It was supposedly built in two stages: (1) by Sultan Al-Ashraf Umar II (1295-6) or 800 Hijri, (2) by Sultan Al-Ashraf Isma'il I (1377-1400) and opened in 1382 or 803 Hijri. This compound can be found in the neighborhood of Ashrafiya, surrounded by a number of other locations and overlooks the Cairo Citadel. The mosque accommodates approximately 120 to 800 worshippers.",

Its first known historical mention is in 1599 (1007 AH), in the Ghayat al-amani of Yahya ibn al-Husayn.\nThe old town of Al-Mahwit is situated around a mountain fortress. Until the 1970s, Al Mahwit was extremely isolated. The town had a population of about 10,000 in the early 1980s, after which infrastructure was developed and water, sanitation and electricity added.\n\nGeography\nThe area is mountainous, set in the Haraz Mountains and attracts trekkers.

          "content": "Mukalla, officially the Mukalla City District, is a seaport and the capital city district of Yemen's largest governorate, Hadhramaut. The city is in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula on the Gulf of Aden, on the shores of the Arabian Sea, about 480 kilometres (300 miles) east of Aden. It is the most important port city in the Hadhramaut region. It is also the sixth-largest city in Yemen, with a population of approximately 595,000 as of 2023. The city is served by the nearby Riyan International Airport.\n\nEtymology\nThe current name \"Mukalla\" (المكلا) is derived from the Arabic verb \"kala\" (كلا), meaning \"to preserve\" or \"to nurture.\" This reflects the city's historical role as a safe harbor and bustling port, providing shelter and nurturing trade in the region.\nHowever, several other names and epithets have been associated with Mukalla throughout its history, each offering insights into its development and cultural significance:\n\nAl-Kheesa: This early name, meaning \"bay\" or \"cove\" in Arabic, highlights Mukalla's sheltered location and its early function as a fishing village.\nBandar Yaqoub: This name comes from the saint Yaqoub bin Yusuf, a man who settled in the city around the 12th century AD. His shrine remains a significant local landmark.\nBandar Omar: Named after a local figure, Omar bin Ali bin Sheikh Abu Bakr, who founded the Al-Rawda Mosque near Yaqoub's shrine.\nBandar Al-Naqeeb: Attributed to Captain Salah bin Hamad Al-Kassadi, a prominent ruler from the Al-Kassad dynasty that governed Mukalla in the 18th century.\nBandar Ghalib: This name emerged during the reign of Sultan Ghaleb bin Awad Al-Quaiti, who ruled the Hadhramaut region in the early 20th century.\n\nHistory\nMukalla is not far from Qana, the ancient principal Hadrami trading post between India and Africa, with incense producing areas in its hinterland.\n\nMukalla was founded in 1035 as a fishing settlement. After witnessing a struggle for control by the Kathiri and Qu'aiti Sultanates in the 19th and 20th centuries, it became the capital of the Qu'aiti State of Hadhramaut. The Qu'aiti Sultanate was part of the Eastern Aden Protectorate until that merger, and a British Resident Advisor was stationed at Mukalla. The other major cities of the Sultanates were Ash-Shihr and Shibam.\n\nCaptain Haines, a British officer who surveyed Yemen in the 1830s, described Mukalla as a town of 4,500 inhabitants with a significant trade in slaves. British explorers Theodore Bent and Mabel Bent used Mukalla several times in the 1890s to enter and exit the Wadi Hadhramaut: “Our starting-point for the interior was Makalla, which is 230 miles from Aden, and is the only spot between Aden and Maskat which has any pretensions to the name of port. The name itself means 'harbour'… Here we were deposited in December 1893 by a chance steamer, one which had been chartered and on which for a consideration we were allowed to take passage. I took turns with the captain to sleep in his cabin, but there was nothing but the deck for the others.” In 1967, Mukalla lost its status of capital city of the Qu'aiti Sultanate as it became a part of the communist People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and following the Yemeni unification in 1990, it became part of what is modern-day Yemen.\n\nYemeni Civil War\nDuring the Yemeni Civil War, on 2 April 2015, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) stormed the central prison, freeing hundreds of prisoners including two senior AQAP commanders. They attacked the central bank and seized 17 billion Yemeni riyals and 1 million U.S. dollars before taking control of the presidential palace in the city. During the Battle of Mukalla (2015), it was reported the entire city was under their control and they planned to establish an Islamic emirate in the wider Hadramaut region. \nOn 3 November 2015, Cyclone Chapala struck Mukalla and destroyed the city's waterfront.\nMukalla was recaptured from Al Qaeda (AQAP) on 25 April 2016, after 2,000 Yemeni and Emirati troops of the Saudi-led coalition advanced into the city, taking control of its port and airport and setting up checkpoints throughout the city.\n\nEconomy\nThe main market souq is one of the main commercial hubs of the city. Mukalla port is located to the east of the town. The port is available for vessels with length not more than 150 metres (490 feet), as per Pilot Book Pilot Directions (as of 2010). At the same time two vessels with the length 150 metres (490 feet) each and about 20 small fishing vessels can stay alongside in Mukalla port (fishing vessel moored alongside one to another). The port is fitted with oil pipe line for tankers. Oil tanks located close to the port. A cement factory of the \"RAYSUT\" Omani-Yemeni company (Oman-Yemen company) located in the port and is able to receive cement in bulk from cement carriers.\n\nSights\nThe old town is open for tourists. Sights include the royal palace of the sultan. Guard towers that were outposts surmount the vicinity of the old town. Nearby are Hadhramaut Mountains, such as that of Husn Ghuraf.\n\nEducation\nThe HUCOM (College of Medicine) of the Hadhramout University is located in Mukalla.\n\nClimate\nNotable residents\nMujahid al-Haiqi, journalist\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nhannah (2021-12-09). \"The Case for Mukalla as Yemen's Capital\".

It is located in the middle of the Hadhramaut Valley, about 360 km (220 miles) from Mukalla, the capital of Mukalla District and the largest city in the area, via western route. It is 12 km (7.5 miles)  from Shibam and 35 km (22 miles) from Tarim, the other large cities in the valley.\nIt is said that the origin of the city was a resting point for travellers. There was a café with a woman named Seiyun there, and the area was named after her in her honor. Since then, the city has become the largest area of Hadhramaut valley. Prominent villages surrounding the city include Madurah, Mérida, Burr, Hazkir, and Houta Sultana.\nIt is served by Seiyun Airport. It is also well known for the Seiyun Palace of the Sultan of Kathiri built in the 1920s with mud and stones. It oversees the marketplace for merchants coming from outside.\n\nHistory\nSeiyun is first mentioned in the beginning of the 4th century, during the reign of King Dhamar who ruled the area around Hadhramaut Valley at the time and was known for destroying 60,000 columns in the area. Destruction of the columns confirms that the Hadhramaut region was undergoing an economic prosperity owing to the spread of grape cultivation in large areas under the climatic conditions different from the current ones.\nSeiyun during the Islamic period emerged as a village in the era of the Rashidun Caliphate. It was administratively part of the city of Tarim. This was the case during the Umayyad period as well. In 708, it became administratively affiliated with the city of Shibam. The son of Haritha led the revolution in 1179 but it gained its autonomy only in the year 1501 when it became the capital of the valley in the era of Badr Abu Tuwairq (1501-1556), where an administrative unit consisting of a sultanate that extended from Ain Ba to the west of the city of Dhofar was founded. In the 18th-century, Yafa conquered the cities of Hadhramaut and took over many parts of Seiyun, where the state was established. In 1852, it became the capital of the State of Kathiri (Aden-Kathiri) which was within the British Aden Protectorate (1869 - 1963). Its fortified fortress, the Sultan's Palace, was the seat of Sultan al-Kathiri. Postage stamps from the Sultanate were sometimes inscribed \"Kathiri State of Seiyun.\" After the independence from British colonialism, Seiyun became the capital of the Southern district in the fifth province of Hadhramaut.\n\nGeography\nSayun District covers an area of approximately 804 square kilometers. It is located in the central part of Hadramaut Governorate and Wadi Hadramaut, at a latitude of 15.57° North and a longitude of 48.46° East. It is bordered by the districts of Tarim and Sah, to the south, Tarim and Al-Quf to the north, Tarim to the east, and Shibam to the west. Sayun is situated 320 kilometers from the governorate's capital, Al Mukalla.\nThe terrain consists of a relatively flat plain, part of the Wadi Hadramaut, surrounded by mountain ranges on the northern and southern sides, leading to the northern and southern plateaus. Several sub-valleys of Wadi Hadramaut pass through these mountain ranges, including Wadi Shuhuh, Wadi Jathmah, and Wadi Bin Salman in Tarim, and Wadi Mudar in Bur.\n\nClimate\nThe climate is tropical with a high temperature in the summer (26 - 42 °C) and a mild temperature in the winter (6 - 28 °C). Rain is rare and usually falls from mid-spring until autumn.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2004 census projections, the population of Sayun District was approximately 111,728 people. The population density was estimated at around 139 people per square kilometer. The residential areas are concentrated in the city and its suburbs, as well as in areas like Taribah, Taris, Al-Gharfah, Wadi Bur, and Mudawwarah. Urban areas constitute approximately 47.4% of the population, while rural areas constitute 52.6%. Sayun District accounts for 10.9% of the total population of the governorate and 14.3% of the population in Wadi Hadramaut and the Desert.\n\nArchitecture\nAs for its architectural development, it can be summarized as follows: In the 7th century AH, it was a small village located within the district of Shaharah - Al-Sahil. It then developed to include other buildings, and a wall was built around it during the reign of Sultan Badr Abi Tuwairq in the year 922 AH. This wall remained until the year 1347 AH.\nRegarding the buildings, in the 7th century AH, they were confined to Shaharah - Al-Sahil until the 8th century AH. The cemetery of the city was established in the 7th century outside the city in the eastern direction. Taha ibn Umar later acquired a piece of land far from the city and built a mosque (Taha Mosque), but there were no other architectural features. In the 10th century AH, the urbanization expanded due to its status as the capital of the Kathiri Sultanate during the reign of Sultan Badr Abi Tuwairq (922-977 AH). In the year 1120 AH, Ali ibn Abdullah Al-Sqaf obtained a piece of desert land in the tribal district and built a mosque on it. The urbanization continued in the 14th century when Abu Bakr bin Salim Al-Saban acquired a piece of desert land in Wadi Jatham and built a mosque on it. The Seiyun Mosque was built in the 9th century AH to accommodate this development. In the 14th century, the mosque was rebuilt as a Friday mosque, and there are four mosques in Seiyun where Friday prayers are held: Al-Jami Mosque, Taha Mosque, Al-Qarn Mosque, and Basalam Mosque. The oldest of them is the Al-Jami Mosque in Seiyun, which was the only mosque where Friday prayers were held.\n\nCity Landmarks\nThere are many ancient landmarks in Seiyun, the most prominent of which are:\n\nSeiyun Museum Palace\nThe Kathiri Palace, also known as the \"Dawil Palace,\" is located in the center of Seiyun, making it one of the most prominent landmarks in the city and all of Hadhramaut. It is considered one of the most magnificent mud-brick architectural masterpieces.\nThis palace was initially established as the residence of the Sultan during the reign of Sultan Badr bin Abdullah bin Jafar Al Kathiri, famously known as \"Abu Tuwairq\" (922-977 AH). This indicates that the palace existed before the reign of Sultan Abu Tuwairq, who made it his official residence and added a mosque to it. He also renovated the palace and expanded it. The Sultan Abu Tuwairq, who emerged during a period of bloody conflicts that engulfed most of the territories of Hadhramaut, managed to occupy most of these territories, including Shahr.\nIn the year 1125 AH, Omar bin Jafar Al Kathiri renewed the construction of the palace. In 1272 AH, Ghalib bin Muhsin Al Kathiri arrived in Seiyun and made it the capital of his rule. He used the Dawil Palace as his ruling headquarters and renovated it. Later, his son Mansour bin Ghalib bin Muhsin Al Kathiri continued the construction of the palace in the period between 1355-1357 AH, adding adornments and making expansions, including the construction of the Al-Aqra, which is the entrance leading to the palace, and building a large hall in the façade and its surroundings. The palace remains in the same state until now.\nRecently, part of the palace has been utilized as a museum, which was inaugurated in 1983. The museum houses ancient artifacts collected from various sites in Wadi Hadhramaut, including those excavated from the Ribat site. It also features sections dedicated to folk heritage and historical documents, including those related to the Kathiri Sultanate when Seiyun served as its capital. Additionally, part of the palace has been designated as an administration office for the Ministry of Culture. A theater was also built on the southeast side of the palace in 1982, accommodating over 5000 spectators.\n\nSeiyun Olympic Stadium\nSeiyun Olympic Stadium is one of the largest stadiums in Yemen and the largest in Hadhramaut, capable of accommodating over 35,000 spectators.\n\nQarat Al-Ar\nQarat Al-Ar houses an ancient fortress mentioned in the year 616 AH when it was cited by historians as the place where Sultan Abdullah bin Rashid Al Qahtani was imprisoned and killed. Later, the fortress was renewed in 855 AH during the reign of Sultan Badr bin Abdullah bin Ali Al Kathiri, who used it as a prison for sultans.\n\nHisn Al-Fals\nHisn Al-Fals is an ancient fortress mentioned initially by historians in the year 603 AH. Its age is estimated to be around 400 years, as it was built during the reign of Sultan Badr Bintuwaireq or the period that followed. It is situated on a hill in the center of Al-Qarn neighborhood in Seiyun and served as an advanced military fortress, with its edges meeting the extensions of the historical wall of Seiyun.\n\nSee also\nKathiri State of Seiyun in Hadhramaut\n\nReferences",

          "content": "Hadhramaut (Arabic: حَضْرَمَوْت, romanized: Ḥaḍramawt ; Hadrami Arabic: حَضْرَمُوت, romanized: Ḥaḍramūt ) is a geographic region in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula which includes the Yemeni governorates of Hadhramaut, Shabwah and Mahrah, Dhofar in southwestern Oman, and Sharurah in the Najran Province of Saudi Arabia, and sometimes the Aden, Abyan and Lahij governorates of Yemen at a more stretched historical definition. The region's people are known as the Hadharem. They formerly spoke Hadramautic, an old South Arabian language, but they now predominantly speak the Hadhrami dialect of Arabic.\nThough the origins of the name are unknown, the name Hadhramaut is traditionally explained as a compound word meaning \"death has come\" or \"court of death,\" derived either from the Arabic ḥaḍara (\"he came\") plus mawt (\"death\"), a folk nickname for Amer bin Qahtan, the region's legendary first settler, or from the Biblical Hebrew ḥaṣar (\"court\" or \"dwelling\") plus māweṯ (\"death\") as seen in Hazarmaveth. The name is of ancient origin and is reflected in the name of the modern-day Yemeni governorate of Hadhramaut.\nThe boundaries of Hadhramaut stretches from the Empty Quarter desert in the north down through its Wadi Hadhramaut and its coastal plain on the Arabian Sea, historically spanning from modern-day Aden in the west across Dhofar to the east but today spans Yemen's Shabwah from the west and Oman's Dhofar to the east. The region once comprised the Qu'aiti and Kathiri sultanates whose lands now form the Hadhramaut governorate, with tribal Hadhrami towns clustered around oasis wells in the wadis, where they farm wheat, millet, dates, coconuts and coffee, while Bedouin herders graze flocks on the plateau. Physically, the region divides into Inner Hadhramaut,centered on the main wadi and its tributaries, and Coastal Hadhramaut, a narrow plain backed by the steep Jowl escarpment rising to about 1,370 m; to the north the highland plateau (Haḍbat Ḥaḍramawt) slopes down sharply into the Empty Quarter, creating a transition from lush valley to arid desert.\n\nToponymy\nThe origins of the name Ḥaḍramawt is disputed, and numerous debated hypotheses regarding its meaning exist. The most popular folk etymology is that the word comes from a nickname of Amer bin Qahtan, who is thought to be the first person to dwell in the region, meaning \"death has come\", from the words in Arabic: حَضَر, romanized: ḥaḍara, lit. 'he came' and Arabic: مَوْت, romanized: mawt, lit. 'death'. Another theory is that it is a variant of the name of Islamic prophet Hud who was sent to this region or his last words \"Ludara al-mawt,\" meaning \"death has come.\"\nThe name Ḥaḍramawt has also been found within Biblical Hazarmaveth. The name means \"court of death\" and is composed of two parts: Hebrew: חֲצַרְ, romanized: ḥaṣar, lit. 'dwelling; court' and Hebrew: מָוֶת māweṯ \"death\". There, Hud was the descendant of ʿĀd, son of Joktan, the purported ancestor and progenitor of the South Arabian kingdoms. According to tradition, the family of ʿĀd was the first to settle in the region, and when the sons of ʿĀd had died, Amer bin Qahtan, nicknamed \"Hadhramaut\", came to power.\nThough the origins of the name are unknown, there are several scholarly proposals. Kamal Salibi says that the diphthong \"-aw\" is an incorrect vocalisation, noting that \"-ūt\" is a frequent ending for place names in the Ḥaḍramawt; given that \"Ḥaḍramūt\" is the colloquial pronunciation of the name, and also its ancient pronunciation, the correct reading of the name would thus be \"place of ḥḍrm\". Salibi proposes, then, that the name means \"the green place\", which is appropriate given its well-irrigated wadis, giving a lushness that contrasts with the surrounding high desert plateau.\nVariations of the name are attested to as early as the middle of the 1st millennium BC. The names ḥḍrmt (𐩢𐩳𐩧𐩣𐩩) and ḥḍrmwt (𐩢𐩳𐩧𐩣𐩥𐩩) are found in texts of the Old South Arabian languages (Ḥaḍramitic, Minaic, Qatabanic and Sabaic), though the second form is not found in any known Ḥaḍramitic inscriptions. In either form, the word itself can be a toponym, a tribal name, or the name of the kingdom of Ḥaḍramawt. In the late fourth or early 3rd century BC, Theophrastus gives the name Άδρραμύτα, a direct transcription of the Semitic name into Greek.\n\nHistory\nPrehistory\nThe earliest human activities in the region date from the Middle Palaeolithic, with the local population using a Levallois technique for flake preparation until the appearance of tools produced by a desert-dwelling pre-agricultural population. From this latter period, or perhaps the succeeding one, can be dated several megalithic structures, large stone circles, and four dolmen-like strictures whose inner surfaces were decorated with repetitive rows of pecked meander or crenellated design.\n\nAncient\nThe Kingdom of Hadhramaut was established in the early 1st millennium BCE. Its capital was Shabwa, not far from the city of Teman (the capital of the Kingdom of Qataban), a tribal federation consisting of several tribes united by their common veneration of the lunar god Sin. Hadhramaut became independent from Sheba in c. 330 BCE.  Hadhramaut and its god Sin are mentioned in the inscription of Surwah by the Makrib Sabean writer Karib'il Watar I around 700–680 BCE.\nThe Kingdom, led by King Shahr-al-Khuraymat, allied with the Minaeans and the Kingdom of Qataban and became independent from the Kingdom of Sheba around 330 BCE, during which the Himyarite dynasty ruled the Kingdom of Sheba. The relationship between the Kingdom of Hadhramaut and the Himyarite Kingdom remained tense, with both sides waging wars against each other for control of the trade routes and territory in the region. Early Islamic authors believed the nomadic Kinda tribe that founded a kingdom in central Arabia were originally from Hadhramaut, although distinct from the settled Hadhrami population.\n\nThe Hadhrami are referred to as \"Chatramotitai\" in ancient Greek texts. Hadhramautic texts come later than Sabaean ones, and some Sabaean texts from Hadhramaut are known. Greek, Latin, Sabaean and Hadhramautic texts preserve the names of many kings of Hadhramaut, but there is as yet no definitive chronology of their reigns. Their capital was Shabwa in the northwest corner of the kingdom, along the Incense trade route. Eratosthenes called it a metropolis. It was an important cult centre as well. At first, the religion was South Arabian polytheism, distinguished by the worship of the Babylonian moon god Sin. By the sixth century, the monotheistic cult of Rahmanan was followed in the local temple.\nThe political history of Hadhramaut is not easy to piece together. Numerous wars involving Hadhramaut are referenced in Sabaean texts. From their inscriptions, the Hadhrami are known to have fortified Libna (now Qalat) against Himyar and to have fortified mwyt (Ḥiṣn al-Ghurāb حِصْن ٱلْغُرَاب) against the Kingdom of Aksum in the period following the death of Dhū Nuwās. The kingdom ceased to exist by the end of the 3rd century CE, having been annexed by the Himyarite Kingdom. Hadhramaut continued to be used in the full titulature of the kings of Sabaʾ and Dhu Raydān (Himyar).\nIn the 2nd century CE, Hadhramaut was known for its frankincense and myrrh trade. The incense trade route (southern incense route) that passed through the southern part of Hadhramaut helped the region flourish economically and culturally. The Kingdom of Hadhramaut played a significant role in connecting the cultures of Arabia, Mesopotamia, East Africa, and the Roman Empire.\n\nMiddle Ages\nIslamic\nIslam reached Hadhramaut in c. 630 after Islamic prophet Muhammad sent Wael bin Hajar as a da'i to the region. The tribes of the region and the ancient aristocracy initially resisted the religion for a considerable period with the city of Tarim being the only adopter of the religion. Nevertheless, companions of Muhammad like Miqdad ibn Aswad and Islamic military leaders like Qaisabah ibn Kalthum were from the region.\nIn the 11th century, the Hadhramaut region came under the rule of the Mahdids, who were of Banu Hadhrami origin. They established the Qasimi dynasty, which ruled the region for several centuries.\nwas reportedly from Hadhramaut. Several prophets before them are believed to have dwelt here, including Hud of ʿĀd. He is thought to be buried at Qabr Hud.\n\nPortuguese and Ottoman Influence\nIn the 16th century, the Portuguese arrived in Hadhramaut and established several settlements along the southern coast. However, their influence was short-lived as the Yemeni Imams managed to drive them out by the 17th century. Subsequently, Hadhramaut came under Ottoman influence, and the Ottomans maintained control over the region until the early 20th century.\n\nModern\nSultanates and the British rule\nThe Qu'aiti sultans ruled the vast majority of Hadramaut, under a loose British protectorate, the Aden Protectorate, from 1882 to 1967, when the Hadhramaut was annexed by South Yemen. The Qu'aiti dynasty was founded by Umar bin Awadh al-Qu'aiti, a Yafa'i tribesman whose wealth and influence as hereditary Jemadar of the Nizam of Hyderabad's armed forces enabled him to establish the Qu'aiti dynasty in the latter half of the 19th century, winning British recognition of his paramount status in the region in 1882. The British Government and the traditional and scholarly sultan Ali bin Salah signed a treaty in 1937, appointing the British government as \"advisors\" in Hadhramaut. The British exiled him to Aden in 1945, but the Protectorate lasted until 1967.\n\nCommunist rule\nIn 1967, the former states of the British Aden Protectorate became an independent Communist state, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. South Yemen was united with North Yemen in 1990 as the Republic of Yemen.\n\nContemporary Yemen\nThe capital and largest city of Hadhramaut is the port Mukalla. Mukalla had a 1994 population of 122,400 and a 2003 population of 174,700, while the port city of Ash Shihr has grown from 48,600 to 69,400 in the same time. One of the more historically important cities in the region is Tarim. An important locus of Islamic learning, it is estimated to contain the highest concentration of descendants of Muhammad anywhere in the world.\n\nGeography\nPolitical geography\nThe borders of Hadhramaut have varied over time to include the territory between Aden and Dhofar, but it always included the Wadi Hadhramaut, the lands between the Wadi and the coast, and the desert region of the Empty Quarter north of the Wadi. This encompasses the current governorates of Hadramaut and Mahra in their entirety as well as parts of the Shabwah Governorate. The current governorate of Hadhramaut roughly incorporates the former territory of the two sultanates.\nThe Hadharem live in densely built towns centered on traditional watering stations along the wadis. Hadharem harvest crops of wheat and millet, tend date palm and coconut groves, and grow some coffee. On the plateau, Bedouins tend sheep and goats. Society is still highly tribal, with the old Seyyid aristocracy, descended from the Islamic prophet Muhammad, traditionally educated, strict in their Islamic observance, and highly respected in religious and secular affairs.\n\nPhysical geography\nHadhramaut is geographically divided into Inner Hadhramaut (Hadrami Arabic: حضرموت الداخل) which is made up of Wadi Hadhramaut, smaller tributary wadis south from the main wadi, and Coastal Hadhramaut (Hadrami Arabic: حضرموت الساحل) which consists of a narrow, arid coastal plain bounded by the steep escarpment of a broad plateau locally known as the Jowl (Hadrami Arabic: ٱلْجَوْل, romanized: al-Jawl, averaging 1,370 m (4,490 ft)). The undefined northern edge of Hadhramaut slopes down to the desert of the Empty Quarter, where the Hadhramaut Plateau or Highlands (Arabic: هَضْبَة حَضْرَمَوْت, romanized: Haḍbat Ḥaḍramawt) meets the Gulf of Aden in the Arabian Sea, elevation abruptly decreases.\n\nInner Hadhramaut\nMountains\nThe Hadhramaut Mountains (Arabic: جِبَال حَضْرَمَوْت, romanized: Jibāl Ḥaḍramawt), also known as the \"Mahrat Mountains\" (Arabic: جِبَال ٱلْمَهْرَة, romanized: Jibāl Al-Mahrah), are a mountain range in Yemen. They are contiguous with the Omani Dhofar Mountains to the northeast, and James Canton considered Aden in the southwest to be in the mountains' recesses.\n\nWadis\nWadi Hadhramaut (Arabic: وادي حضرموت) is the main wadi in the region, which has 16 tributary wadis, which are:\n\nDesert\nCoastal Hadhramaut\nEconomy\nHistorically, Hadhramaut was known for being a major producer of frankincense, which in the early 20th century was mainly exported to Mumbai in India. The region has also produced senna and coconut. Farming and fishing are other economic activities in the region, where 5.8% of Yemen's total agriculture comes from the Hadhramaut Governorate alone. Key agricultural products from this region include dates and various grains. Additionally, the fishing sector serves as a primary economic resource for the local population, benefiting from a lengthy coastline along the Arabian Sea that is rich in diverse fish and marine life.\nThe governorate's lands also hold mineral resources, notably oil and gold, further enhancing its economic significance. Currently, Hadhramaut produces approximately 260,000 barrels of oil per day; one of the most productive fields is Al Maseelah in the strip (14), which was discovered in 1993. The Yemeni government is keen to develop its oil fields to increase oil production to increase national wealth in response to the requirements of economic and social development in the country. Oil contributes 30–40% of the nation's GDP, over 70% of total state revenues, and more than 90% of the value of the country's exports.\n\nOil and gas\nA Soviet discovery in the southern governorate of Shabwah has proven only marginally successful even when taken over by a different group. A Western consortium began exporting oil from Masila in the Hadhramaut in 1993, and production there reached 67,000 m3/d (420,000 bbl/d) in 1999. There are new finds in the Jannah (formerly known as the Joint Oil Exploration Area) and east Shabwah blocks. Yemen's oil exports in 1995 earned about US$1 billion. Yemen's offshore oil and gas deposits are estimated to contain billions of barrels of oil and gas. Marib oil contains associated natural gas. In September 1995, the Yemeni Government signed an agreement that designated TotalEnergies of France to be the lead company for a project for the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In 1997, Yemen Gas Company joined with various privately held companies to establish Yemen LNG (YLNG).\n\nIn August 2005, the government gave final approval to three LNG supply agreements, enabling YLNG to award a $2 billion contract to an international consortium to build the country's first liquefaction plant at Balhaf on the Arabian Sea coast. The project is a $3.7 billion investment over 25 years, producing approximately 6.7 million tons of LNG annually, with shipments likely to go to the United States and South Korea. Production of LNG began in October 2009. The Yemen government expects the LNG project to add $350 million to its budget and enable it to develop a petrochemicals industry.\nHadramout produces approximately 258.8 thousand barrels per day. One of the prominent oil fields is the Masila Basin Sector (14), discovered in 1993. The Yemeni government is committed to developing its oil fields to increase oil production, aiming to enhance national wealth in response to the country's economic and social development needs. Oil contributes between 30% and 40% of the gross domestic product (GDP) value and represents more than 70% of the total general budget revenues of the state. Moreover, it constitutes more than 90% of the country's export value.\n\nCulture\nMusic and dance\nHadhrami Music is one of the five main Yemeni musical genres or \"colours\" (alwan). It is native to the Hadhramaut region and regarded as one of the most prominent forms of Arabic music. Its unique maqamat are widely employed by composers and musicians throughout the Arabian Peninsula. It compasses vocal performances in the Hadhrami Arabic dialect and features melodic phrases and a characteristic humming-style known as the Dan.\nHadhramaut's strategic location along the ancient incense road has shaped a unique musical tradition. Indian and African musical elements have intermingled with indigenous forms over time. Besides, It has been deeply influenced by Sufism.\n\nThe region is renowned for its vast array of over four hundred distinct rhythmic patterns that vary by locality. These rhythms are closely tied to daily activities and special occasions—from planting and fishing to wedding celebrations. A key musical form in the region is al-Dan, a fixed melodic structure in which the melody precedes the lyrics; in contrast, in other songs, the lyrics typically come before the melody. Steps have been taken by the Yemeni government to include the Dan art on UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage, Cultural authorities in Yemen have already received initial approval from UNESCO to consider its inclusion.\nNumerous art critics note that the Hadhrami Dan has played a pivotal role in shaping vocal traditions throughout the Arab world, particularly within the Gulf region. This distinctive musical form is regarded as a foundational element for many singing schools, with contemporary artists continuing to draw inspiration from its rich heritage and folkloric melodies.\nThe Hadhrami Dan has spread to the Arabian Gulf through the migration of Hadhrami musicians who settled in Gulf countries. Over time, local musicians integrated the Hadhrami Dan and other forms of the Dan and other Hadhrami musical forms into their own repertoires. Furthermore, Hadhrami music has significantly influenced the cultural landscapes of regions beyond the Arabian Peninsula, notably in parts of Africa and East Asia.\n\nSeveral Hadhrami influential musicians and poets played an important role in shaping Hadhrami and the wider Arabian music. Abu Bakr Salem Belfkih (1932–2017), for example, modernised al-Dân songs by incorporating contemporary musical instruments, while poets such as Haddad al-Kaff (1910–1970) and Hussein al-Mihdhar (1932–2000) enriched the tradition with their lyrics. Additionally, Mohammed Juma Khan (1903–1963) is celebrated as a pioneer who blended his Punjabi musical influences with local traditions.\nMoreover, several prominent non-Hadhrami Arab musicians have also embraced Hadhrami styles. These include Kuwaiti singer Abdallah Al Rowaished; Saudi singers Abdul Majeed Abdullah and Abdel Rab Idris, the latter of Hadhrami origin; as well as Emirati singers Ahlam and Hussain Al Jassmi.\nThe instruments used in Hadhrami music vary widely, encompassing percussion instruments, string instruments, wind instruments, and simple clapping techniques, often used individually or in combination. This includes notably the Qanbūs, which the Hadhrami migrants spread across the Indian Ocean across the  Muslim Southeast Asia areas (notably in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei).\n\nArchitecture\nThe Hadhramaut region has significant tourism potential due to its historical and cultural heritage. The ancient city of Shibam, known as \"the Manhattan of the Desert,\" is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is famous for its high-rise mud-brick buildings and has attracted tourists worldwide. Other notable tourist attractions in the region include the historic towns of Tarim and Seiyun, the Wadi Hadramout with its lush palm groves, and the traditional mud-brick architecture found throughout the region.\nMukalla, a coastal city in the Hadhramaut region. The city's buildings exhibit intricate facades adorned with geometric patterns, reflecting local craftsmanship. Minarets with delicate latticework rise gracefully, reflecting a blend of architectural and spiritual significance. Mukalla's urban design features narrow alleys and courtyard houses, showcasing adaptation to the arid climate and fostering community interaction. The use of indigenous materials further emphasizes its connection to the local context.\n\nTarim has a distinctive Hadhrami architecture with filigreed facades and minarets. It has interconnected alleyways and courtyards. Tarim was the Islamic Capital of Culture in 2010. It has the world's tallest mudbrick minaret, located in the Al-Muhdhar Mosque. There are initiatives to protect and restore its mud structures.\n\nShibam, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is known for its distinct architecture. The houses of Shibam are all made out of mudbrick, and about 500 of them are tower blocks, which rise 5 to 11 stories high, with each floor having one or two rooms. This architectural style was used in order to protect residents from Bedouin attacks. While Shibam has been in existence for an estimated 1,700 years, most of the city's houses originate from the 16th century. Many, though, have been rebuilt numerous times in the last few centuries.\nShibam is often called \"the oldest skyscraper city in the world\". It is one of the oldest and best examples of urban planning based on the principle of vertical construction. The city has some of the tallest mud buildings in the world, with some of them over 30 m (98 feet) high, thus being early high-rise apartment buildings. In order to protect the buildings from rain and erosion, the walls must be routinely maintained by applying fresh layers of mud. The city is surrounded by a fortified wall, giving it the name \"the walled city of Shibam\".\n\nHabban, an ancient city within the Shabwa governorate, boasts a distinct architectural legacy characterized by ingenious mud and straw construction techniques. Notable features include towering mud structures with intricate carvings, reflecting both historical significance and artistic flair. Habban's architecture showcases a blend of utilitarian functionality and aesthetic charm. The enduring mud buildings' diverse architectural styles, including palaces, mosques, and tombs, capture the city's cultural tapestry. Rooted in Yemeni heritage, Habban's architecture is a living embodiment of the intersection between local culture and the built environment, reflecting the city's historical and cultural significance.\n\nDemographics\nThe people of the region are known as the Hadharem, generally belong to the Semitic south Arabians who claim descent from Yarub bin Qahtan. There is, however, a large number of Sada (Hadrami Arabic: سادة, romanized: Sadah; Singular: Sayyid), or descendant of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, and of townsmen of northern origin, besides a considerable class of African or mixed descent. The Sada, descendants of Husain ibn Ali, grandson of the Islamic Prophet, form a numerous and highly respected aristocracy. They are divided into families, the chiefs of which are known as Munsibs, who are looked on as the religious leaders of the people and are even, in some cases are regarded with great respect as saints. Among the leading families are that of Sheikh Abu Bakar bin Salem (Hadrami Arabic: الشيخ ابو بكر بن سالم) of ʽAynat, al-Aidarus (Hadrami Arabic: العيدروس) of Shihr and Wadi Dawan, Bin Sumayt (Hadrami Arabic: بن سميط) of Shibam and the Sakkaf (Hadrami Arabic: سقاف) of Seiyun. They do not bear arms, nor occupy themselves in trade, nor manual labour, nor even agriculture; though owning a large proportion of the land, they employ labourers to cultivate it. As compared with the other classes, they are well educated and are strict in their observance of religious duties, and owing to the respect due to their descent, they exercise a strong influence both in temporal and spiritual affairs.\nThe Mashayikh (Hadrami Arabic: المشايخ) is another highly regarded group that is second in prestige to the Sada. Like the Sada, they don't bear arms. Men from this group are given the honorific surname Sheikh (Hadrami Arabic: شيخ) and women are given the surname Sheikha (Hadrami Arabic: شيخة) which is different from the term Sheikh (Arabic: شيخ) that is used to refer to a tribal chief or a Muslim scholar. Prominent Mashayikh families include the ‘Amudi (Hadrami Arabic: العمودي), Ba Wazir (Hadrami Arabic: با وزير), and Ba ‘Abbad (Hadrami Arabic: با عبّاد) families.\nThe Qaba'il (Hadrami Arabic: القبائل) or tribesmen, as in the rest of Arabia, are the predominant class in the population. All the adults carry arms. Some of the tribes have settled towns and villages, others live a bedouin life, keeping however within the territory which is recognised as belonging to the tribe. They are divided into sections or families, each headed by a chief while the head of the tribe is called the muqaddam or sultan. He is the leader in peace and in war, but the tribesmen are not his subjects; he can only rule with their support. Historically, the most powerful tribes in Hadhramaut was the Qu’aiti, a branch of the Yafa'a tribe. Originally invited by the Sada to protect the settled districts against the marauding tribes, they established themselves as rulers of the country, and possessed the coastal districts with the towns of Mukalla and Shihr as well as Shibam in the interior. The family had accumulated great wealth and was  in the service of the Nizam of Hyderabad in India as commander of the Arab levy composed of his tribesmen.\nThe townsmen are the free inhabitants of the towns and villages as distinguished from the Sada and the tribesmen; they do not carry arms, but are the working members of the community, merchants, artificers, cultivators, and servants and are entirely dependent on the tribes and chiefs under whose protection they live. The servile class contains a large African element, brought over formerly when the slave trade nourished on this coast; as all Islamic countries they are well treated, and often rise to positions of trust.\n\nHadhrami diaspora\nSince the early 19th century, large-scale Hadhramaut migration has established sizable Hadhrami minorities all around the Indian Ocean, in South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Africa, including Mombasa, Hyderabad, Aurangabad, Maharashtrian Konkan, Mangalore, Bhatkal, Gangolli, Malabar, Sylhet, Tanzania, the Malay Archipelago, Sri Lanka, southern Philippines and Singapore. In Hyderabad and Aurangabad, the community is known as Chaush and resides mostly in the neighborhood of Barkas. There are also settlements of Hadharem  in Gujarat, such as in Ahmadabad and Surat. In South India, the Nawayath community also descends from Hadrami traders.\nEarlier, several sultans in the Malay Archipelago such as the Malacca Sultanate, Pontianak Sultanate or Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura were descents of Hadharem . In the 19th century, Hadhrami businessmen owned many of the maritime armada of barks, brigs, schooners and other ships in the Malay archipelago. In modern times, several Indonesian ministers, including former Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and former Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad are of Hadhrami descent, as is the former Prime Minister of East Timor, Mari Alkatiri (2006).\nThe Hadharem  have also settled in large numbers along the East African coast, and two former ministers in Kenya, Shariff Nasser and Najib Balala, are of Hadhrami descent. It has also been proved by genetic evidence that the Lemba people of Southern Africa bear some relation to the people of Hadramaut.\nWithin the Hadhramaut region there has been a historical Jewish population.\n\nSee also\nHejaz\nTihamah\nAl-Yamama\nNajd\nGreater Yemen\n\nExplanatory notes\nLanguage notes\nReferences\nSources\nDarles, Christian (2018). \"Mud Brick Architecture in Ḥaḍramawt-Yemen under the Qu'aiti and Kathiri Sultanates\".

          "summary": "Hadhramaut (Arabic: حَضْرَمَوْت, romanized: Ḥaḍramawt ; Hadrami Arabic: حَضْرَمُوت, romanized: Ḥaḍramūt ) is a geographic region in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula which includes the Yemeni governorates of Hadhramaut, Shabwah and Mahrah, Dhofar in southwestern Oman, and Sharurah in the Najran Province of Saudi Arabia, and sometimes the Aden, Abyan and Lahij governorates of Yemen at a more stretched historical definition. The region's people are known as the Hadharem. They formerly spoke Hadramautic, an old South Arabian language, but they now predominantly speak the Hadhrami dialect of Arabic.\nThough the origins of the name are unknown, the name Hadhramaut is traditionally explained as a compound word meaning \"death has come\" or \"court of death,\" derived either from the Arabic ḥaḍara (\"he came\") plus mawt (\"death\"), a folk nickname for Amer bin Qahtan, the region's legendary first settler, or from the Biblical Hebrew ḥaṣar (\"court\" or \"dwelling\") plus māweṯ (\"death\") as seen in Hazarmaveth. The name is of ancient origin and is reflected in the name of the modern-day Yemeni governorate of Hadhramaut.\nThe boundaries of Hadhramaut stretches from the Empty Quarter desert in the north down through its Wadi Hadhramaut and its coastal plain on the Arabian Sea, historically spanning from modern-day Aden in the west across Dhofar to the east but today spans Yemen's Shabwah from the west and Oman's Dhofar to the east. The region once comprised the Qu'aiti and Kathiri sultanates whose lands now form the Hadhramaut governorate, with tribal Hadhrami towns clustered around oasis wells in the wadis, where they farm wheat, millet, dates, coconuts and coffee, while Bedouin herders graze flocks on the plateau. Physically, the region divides into Inner Hadhramaut,centered on the main wadi and its tributaries, and Coastal Hadhramaut, a narrow plain backed by the steep Jowl escarpment rising to about 1,370 m; to the north the highland plateau (Haḍbat Ḥaḍramawt) slopes down sharply into the Empty Quarter, creating a transition from lush valley to arid desert.",
