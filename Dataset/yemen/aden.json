      "content": "Aden (Arabic: عَدَنْ‎, romanized: ʿAdan; IPA: [ʕa.dan]) is a port city located in Yemen in the southern part of the Arabian peninsula, on the north coast of the Gulf of Aden, positioned near the eastern approach to the Red Sea. It is situated approximately 170 km (110 mi) east of the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. With its strategic location on the coastline, Aden serves as a gateway between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, making it a crucial maritime hub connecting Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. As of September 2025, Aden has a population of approximately  1,154,000 residents, making it one of the largest cities in Yemen.\nAden is the capital and principal part of Aden Governorate, encompassing eight districts. During the colonial period, the name Aden referred to the area along the north coast of the gulf, encompassing Tawahi, Mualla, Crater, and much of Khor Maksar district. The western harbour peninsula, known as Little Aden, now falls within the Al Buraiqeh district.\n\nBefore gaining independence, Aden comprised distinct sectors: Crater, the original port; Ma'alla, the modern port; Tawahi, formerly \"Steamer Point\"; and Gold Mohur resorts. Khormaksar, on the isthmus connecting Aden to the mainland, hosts diplomatic missions, Aden University's main offices, and Aden International Airport. On the mainland, sectors include Sheikh Othman, an old oasis area; Al-Mansura, a British-planned town; and Madinat ash-Sha'b (formerly Madinat al-Ittihad), the former capital of the South Arabian Federation, now housing a large power/desalination facility and additional Aden University faculties.\nAden encloses the eastern side of a vast, natural harbour that constitutes the modern port. Little Aden was developed as the site of the oil refinery and tanker port. Both were established and operated by British Petroleum until they were turned over to South Yemeni government ownership and control in 1978.\nAden used to be the capital of South Yemen until its unity with North Yemen on 22 May 1990. It is currently the temporary capital of Yemen since the 2014 Coup d'état, hosting some members of the Cabinet of Yemen mainly in al-Maashiq Palace. It is also the seat of the secessionist Southern Transitional Council, which exercises control over the city.\n\nEtymology\nAden is a home and a place for ships, and the word Aden means reside in the place, so the word \"Aden\" means resident, and it is said \"Aden Al-Balad\", meaning the settlement of the country. Among the sayings of geographers about the city:\nYaqut al-Hamwi said: \"It is a famous city on the coast of the Indian Sea, towards the Yemen, and it is poor, with no water or pasture. They drink from a spring between it and Aden, about a distance of about today, and despite that, it is bad, except that this place is the port for Indian ships, and merchants gather there for that reason, as it is a town of trade.\" And it is added to Abyan, which is the opposite of Aden in its entirety.\nIbn Manzur said: \"It is a country on the edge of the sea in the furthest part of Yemen.\"\nIbn Khaldun said: \"This Aden is one of the most fortified cities in Yemen, and it is on the bank of the Indian Sea. It is still a country of trade from the time of the Trabaids, and most of them were built with stones, which is why silk merchants visit it often.\"\n\nHistory\nAntiquity\nAden is an ancient port and was mentioned by the Greeks under the name (Ancient Greek: Αραβία Εμπόριον, romanised: Arabia Emporion), which means an Arabic trade port. The port's convenient position on the sea route between India and Europe has made Aden desirable to rulers who sought to possess it at various times throughout history. Known as Eudaemon (Ancient Greek: Ευδαίμων, meaning \"blissful, prosperous\") in the 1st century BC, it was a transshipping point for the Red Sea trade, but fell on hard times when new shipping practices by-passed it and made the daring direct crossing to India in the 1st century AD, according to the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. The same work describes Aden as \"a village by the shore\", which would well describe the town of Crater while it was still little developed. There is no mention of fortification at this stage. Aden was more an island than a peninsula, as the isthmus (a tombolo) was not then so developed as it is today. Aden was explicitly mentioned by this name in the Book of Ezekiel, which talks about Jerusalem, and it says:\"The merchants of Sheba and Raamah are your merchants. They set up your markets with the finest perfumes and every precious stone and gold. Harran, Qena, and Aden are the merchants of Sheba, and Assyria and Kilmud are your merchants.\"At its beginning, the city was a small peninsula with no significant natural resources, but its location between Egypt and India made it important in the ancient Indian Ocean trade route. The city was the home of the ancient Kingdom of Awsan from the eighth to seventh centuries BC. In the beginning of the seventh century BC, Karibʾil Watar I, king of the Kingdom of Sheba, launched a campaign against Awsan during which, according to the Sabaean texts, sixteen thousand people were killed, forty thousand people were enslaved, and the kings of Awsan made offerings to the god Almaqah, according to the inscription that Karibʾil Watar I left in Sirwah, commemorating his victory.\nIn the second half of the first century BC, the Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar determined to control Arabia Felix and reach the Indian Ocean. Aelius Gallus' Roman expedition to Arabia Felix (26–25 BCE) aimed to capture the Sabaean capital of Marib but failed due to extreme desert conditions, disease, and logistical challenges. After an unsuccessful week-long siege, the army, weakened by illness and dehydration, withdrew, losing most of its ~10,000 troops to environmental factors and disease\" The Himyarites overthrew the Kingdom of Sheba in 275 AD and took control of Aden. Recent incomplete archaeological studies suggest that the Himyarites were the ones who built the huge water cisterns currently known as the \"Cisterns of Aden\", which stored approximately 136,382,757 liters of water.\nThe Himyarite Kingdom fell in the first quarter of the sixth century AD. Yusuf Dhu Nuwas mentioned Bab al-Mandab in one of his writings. The forces of the Kingdom of Aksum were entering Yemen through it. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian I sent a fleet to fight the Himyarite Jews and support the Kingdom of Aksum and the Christians of Najran. The fleet entered through Aden. Byzantine sources indicate that the Sasanian Empire took control of the city in 571 AD.\nA local legend in Yemen states that Aden may be as old as human history itself. Some also believe that Cain and Abel are buried somewhere in the city.\n\nMedieval history\nAlthough the pre-Islamic Himyar civilisation was capable of building large structures, there seems to have been little fortification at this stage. Fortifications at Mareb and other places in Yemen and the Hadhramaut make it clear that both the Himyar and the Sabean cultures were well capable of it. Thus, watchtowers, since destroyed, are possible. However, the Arab historians Ibn al Mujawir and Abu Makhramah attribute the first fortification of Aden to Beni Zuree'a. Abu Makhramah has also included a detailed biography of Muhammad Azim Sultan Qamarbandi Naqsh in his work, Tarikh ul-Yemen. The aim seems to have been twofold: to keep hostile forces out and to maintain revenue by controlling the movement of goods, thereby preventing smuggling. In its original form, some of this work was relatively feeble.\nWith the introduction of Islam to Yemen in the seventh century AD, Aden experienced a period of stagnation that lasted until the ninth century AD. In the early years of Islam, Aden belonged to the province of Jund (Taiz). It was controlled by the state of Ziyadid and the Sulayhid. After the death of Ali bin Muhammad Al-Sulayhi, his son took charge of Zurayids, and Aden continued to pay the annual royalty until Queen Arwa bint Ahmed Al-Sulayhi reduced it. After the fall of the Sulayhid state, the Banu Zurayi became independent in Aden, taking advantage of the Sulayhids’ preoccupation with the Khawlan tribes. The Zurayites continued to rule Aden, Lahj, and Abyan for less than forty years until they fell under the Ayyubids’ control of the city. A major battle took place between Turan Shah bin Ayyub and Yasser bin Bilal al-Muhammadi, Minister of State, and the Zurayiyyah were defeated and al-Muhammadi fled to Taiz. One of the most important contributors to the defeat of the Zurayids was their ongoing wars with the Bani Mahdi in Tihama and the departure of their army to confront the Ayyubids instead of fortifying themselves in Aden.\nAfter 1175, rebuilding in a more solid form began, and ever since then Aden has been a popular city attracting sailors and merchants from Egypt, Sindh, Gujarat, East Africa and even China. According to Muqaddasi, Persians formed the majority of Aden's population in the 10th century. It was visited by the medieval scholar Ibn Battuta in the 14th century, who described Aden's reservoirs, the Cisterns of Tawila, \"These reservoirs accumulate rainwater for the sole purpose of drinking for the city's citizens.\"\nDuring the Ayyubid period in Yemen, Sana'a and its environs were more hostile to their presence than other regions. The Zaidi tribes were able to defeat the Ayyubids in 1226, but Omar bin Rasul, the founder of the Rasulid state, was able to repel them, so he tightened his control over Aden. The city regained its position during the days of the Rasulids, so they dug wells and built schools, and Aden flourished commercially. The kings of Bani Rasul were also merchants and enacted a number of laws and regulations to codify trade in the city.\nThe Banu Tahir were able to control Aden after the Banu Rasool, and the Italian traveller Lodovico di Verthama describes it as one of the most powerful cities seen on Earth during the days of the Tahirids.\n\nIn 1513, the Portuguese, led by Afonso de Albuquerque, launched an unsuccessful four-day naval siege of Aden. The Mamluks in Egypt sensed the danger and sent a force led by Hussein al-Kurdi. The victorious King Amer bin Abdul Wahhab provided great aid to the Kurds, but he suffered a heavy defeat in the Battle of Diu. The Mamluks sent a second fleet, but the victorious king refused to cooperate with the Mamluks because he had succeeded in repelling the Portuguese from Aden without their help. Hussein al-Kurdi became angry and allied with the Zaidi Imam, who was opposed to the Tahirids, al-Mutawakkil Sharaf al-Din, and the Tahirid cities fell successively, with the exception of Aden. The Ottoman Empire took control of the city in 1538. The Ottomans' goal was to prevent the Portuguese from controlling Aden, so the city witnessed difficult days, in addition to the fact that the port of Mocha gained greater importance at the expense of Aden during the sixteenth century. The city's population declined and it turned into a small village with a population of no more than 600 people. While its population was approximately eighty thousand people during the days of the Rasulid state.In 1421, China's Ming dynasty Yongle Emperor ordered principal envoy grand eunuch Li Xing and grand eunuch Zhou Man of Zheng He's fleet to convey an imperial edict with hats and robes to bestow on the king of Aden. The envoys boarded three treasure ships and set sail from Sumatra to the port of Aden. This event was recorded in the book Yingyai Shenglan by Ma Huan who accompanied the imperial envoy.\nAfter Ottoman rule, Aden was ruled by the Sultanate of Lahej, under suzerainty of the Zaidi imams of Yemen. The first political intercourse between Lahej and the British took place in 1799, when a naval force was sent from Great Britain, with a detachment of troops from India, to occupy the island of Perim and prevent all communication of the French in Egypt with the Indian Ocean, by way of the Red Sea. The island of Perim was found unsuitable for troops, and the Sultan of Lahej, Ahmed bin Abdul Karim, received the detachment for some time at Aden. He proposed to enter into an alliance and to grant Aden as a permanent station, but the offer was declined. A Treaty was, however, concluded with the Sultan in 1802 by Admiral Sir Home Popham, who was instructed to enter into political and commercial alliances with the chief rulers on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea.\n\nModern history\nThe situation was different in the north of the country, where the Zaidis did not recognise the authority of the Ottomans and revolted against them many times, the most recent of which was the revolution of Imam Al-Mansur Billah Al-Qasim bin Muhammad bin Al-Qasim, who and his son Al-Mu'ayyad Billah Muhammad were able to unite the tribes and expel the Ottomans. The imams relied on the revenues from the port of Mocha, and Aden was not as important as the Abadlahs were. At the end of the eighteenth century, Sultan Fadl al-Abdali concluded an alliance with the Yafi tribes to rebel against the Zaidi imams and monopolise Aden's revenues equally among them. The Sultan of Lahej got rid of the imams, but he did not fulfil his promise to Yafa. The Zaidi imams did not recognise inheritance and saw fighting for the imamate, so the war between Al-Nasir Muhammad bin Ishaq and Al-Mansur Al-Hussein bin Al-Mutawakkil prolonged, so Al-Abdali took the opportunity to declare his independence in Lahej and Aden. The English had been visiting Aden and Mocha from 1609, led by Sir Henry Middleton, who was imprisoned, his ships confiscated, and eight of his men killed.\nThe British tried to conclude treaties with the Zaidi imams after the Ottomans were expelled from Aden. They visited Sana'a and Mocha, but they treated the British ambassador poorly and rejected his offer. Things were different when the Abdali gained independence from Lahj and Medina. They signed a treaty with the British in 1802, stipulating that they build a factory in Crater and allocate a special cemetery for British subjects free of charge. The Abdali wanted protection from the tribes. Sultan Fadl bin Ali was killed by Yafi’ gunmen, then one of the sheikhs of Al-Hujariya invaded Lahj and besieged it for five months. Al-Awaliq also besieged it with eight thousand fighters, and they did not leave until Sultan Ahmed bin Abdul Karim paid them seven thousand dollars. Then the Fadl family attacked Aden in 1836.\n\nBritish administration 1839–1967\nIn 1609 The Ascension was the first English ship to visit Aden, before sailing on to Mocha during the fourth voyage of the East India Company.\nBritish interests in Aden began in 1796 with Napoleon's invasion of Egypt, after which a British fleet docked at Aden for several months at the invitation of the sultan. The French were defeated in Egypt in 1801, and their privateers were tracked down over the subsequent decade. By 1800, Aden was a small village with a population of 600 Arabs, Somalis, Jews, and Indians—housed for the most part in huts of reed matting erected among ruins recalling a vanished era of wealth and prosperity. As there was little British trade in the Red Sea, most British politicians until the 1830s had no further interest in the area beyond the suppression of piracy. However, a small number of government officials and the East India Company officials thought that a British base in the area was necessary to prevent another French advance through Egypt or Russian expansion through Persia. The emergence of Muhammad Ali of Egypt as a strong local ruler only increased their concerns. The governor of Bombay from 1834 to 1838, Sir Robert Grant, was one of those who believed that India could only be protected by preemptively seizing \"places of strength\" to protect the Indian Ocean.\nThe Red Sea increased in importance after the steamship Hugh Lindsay sailed from Bombay to the Suez isthmus in 1830, stopping at Aden with the sultan's consent to resupply with coal. Although cargo was still carried around the Cape of Good Hope in sailing ships, a steam route to the Suez could provide a much quicker option for transporting officials and important communications. Grant felt that armed ships steaming regularly between Bombay and Suez would help secure British interests in the region and did all he could to progress his vision. After lengthy negotiations due to the costs of investing in the new technology, the government agreed to pay half the costs for six voyages per year and the East India Company board approved the purchase of two new steamers in 1837. Grant immediately announced that monthly voyages to Suez would take place, despite the fact that no secure coal supplying station had been found. The British first stationed a coal depot on the island of Socotra in 1834. However, due to the lack of suitable infrastructure there, they quickly lost interest in Socotra and turned towards Aden instead.\nIn 1838, under Muhsin bin Fadl, Lahej ceded 194 km2 (75 sq mi) including Aden to the British. On 19 January 1839, the British East India Company landed Royal Marines at Aden to definitively conquer the territory (the so-called Aden Expedition) and stop attacks by pirates against British shipping to India. In 1850 it was declared a free trade port, with the liquor, salt, arms, and opium trades developing duties as it won all the coffee trade from Mokha. The port lies about equidistant from the Suez Canal, Bombay, and Zanzibar, which were all important British possessions. Aden had been an entrepôt and a way-station for ships in the ancient world. There, supplies, particularly water, were replenished, so, in the mid-19th century, it became necessary to replenish coal and boiler water. Thus Aden acquired a coaling station at Steamer Point and Aden was to remain under British control until November 1967.\n\nUntil 1937, Aden was governed as part of British India and was known as the Aden Settlement. Its original territory was enlarged in 1857 by the 13 km2 (5.0 sq mi) island of Perim, in 1868 by the 73 km2 (28 sq mi) Khuriya Muriya Islands, and in 1915 by the 108 km2 (42 sq mi) island of Kamaran. The settlement would become Aden Province in 1935.\n\nIn 1937, the settlement was detached from India and became the Colony of Aden, a British Crown colony. The change in government was a step towards the change in the official currency unit. When British India became independent in 1947, Indian rupees (divided into annas) were replaced in Aden by East African shillings. The hinterland of Aden and Hadhramaut were also loosely tied to Britain as the Aden Protectorate, which was overseen from Aden.\n\nAden's location also made it a useful entrepôt for mail passing between places around the Indian Ocean and Europe. Thus, a ship passing from Suez to Bombay could leave mail for Mombasa at Aden for collection (See Postage stamps and postal history of Aden). In December 1947, a three-day riot broke out in reaction to the drafting of the Partition Plan for Palestine. The riots and their repression by the Aden Protectorate Levies saw the killing of 76-82 Jews, 33 Arabs, 4 Muslim Indians and 1 Somali, in addition to looting and damaging of property. After the Suez Crisis in 1956, the British held on to Aden as an outpost in the region for another decade. The British authorities had already decided to further expand its port shortly before the Suez Canal's 1956 closure.\nAden sent a team of two to the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Western Australia.\n\nFederation of South Arabia and the Aden Emergency\nIn order to stabilise Aden and the surrounding Aden Protectorate from the designs of the Egyptian backed republicans of North Yemen, the British attempted gradually to unite the disparate states of the region in preparation for eventual independence. On 18 January 1963, the Colony of Aden was incorporated into the Federation of Arab Emirates of the South against the wishes of North Yemen. The city became the State of Aden and the Federation was renamed the Federation of South Arabia (FSA).\nAn insurgency against British administration known as the Aden Emergency began with a grenade attack by the communist National Liberation Front (NLF), against the British High Commissioner on 10 December 1963, killing one person and injuring fifty, and a \"state of emergency\" was declared.\nIn 1964, Britain announced its intention to grant independence to the FSA in 1968, but that British troops would remain in Aden. The security situation deteriorated as NLF and FLOSY (Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen) vied for the upper hand.\nIn January 1967, there were mass riots between the NLF and their rival FLOSY supporters in the old Arab quarter of Aden town. This conflict continued until mid February, despite the intervention of British troops. On 20 June 1967, 23 British Army soldiers were ambushed and shot dead by members of Aden Police during the Aden Mutiny in the Crater District. During the period there were as many attacks on the British troops by both sides as against each other culminating in the destruction of an Aden Airways DC3 plane in the air with no survivors.\nThe increased violence was a determining factor in the British ensuring all families were evacuated more quickly than initially intended, as recorded in From Barren Rocks to Living Stones.\nOn 30 November 1967, British troops were evacuated, leaving Aden and the rest of the FSA under NLF control. The Royal Marines, who had been the first British troops to arrive in Aden in 1839, were the last to leave – with the exception of a Royal Engineer detachment (10 Airfields Squadron left Aden on 13 December 1967). As part of a larger Royal Navy task force, HMS Albion's helicopters lifted off remaining Royal Marine commandos left to secure the airfield.\n\nPost-independence\nThe last British soldier left Aden on November 30, 1967, and the National Liberation Front had the upper hand at the expense of the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, whose members were divided between joining the National Front or leaving for North Yemen, so Abdullah Al-Asanj and Muhammad Basindwa left for North Yemen. Qahtan al-Sha'bi assumed the presidency of the new state, and the sheikhdoms of the Eastern Protectorate of Hadramaut and Al-Mahra were annexed to the new state. Al-Shaabi took over a new country with a collapsed economy. Civilian workers and businessmen left, and British support ceased. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 played an important role in the country's economy, as it reduced the number of ships crossing Aden by 75%.\nThe new state was divided into six governorates on December 11, 1967, in order to end the manifestations of tribalism in the state and ignore the tribal borders between the defunct sheikhdoms. On March 20, 1968, Qahtan dismissed all leftist leaders from the government and party membership. He was able to put down a rebellion led by leftist factions in the army in May of the same year, and faced new rebellions from leftist parties in July, August and December 1968. This is because all Arab countries welcomed the front. National Liberation received a cold reception. Regimes like Egypt wanted to merge the National Front with the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, where the leftist section was more numerous than the supporters of the popular Qahtan. They wanted a regime that would lead the masses and face the great challenges facing the new state, the most important of which was the bankruptcy of the treasury.\n\nQahtan al-Shaabi dismissed Interior Minister Muhammad Ali Haitham on 16 June 1969, but the latter, with his ties to the tribes and the army, reassembled the leftist forces that had been dispersed by President Qahtan al-Shaabi, and they were able to place him under house arrest on 22 June. A presidential committee was formed from Five people: Salem Rabie Ali, who became president, Muhammad Saleh Al-Awlaki, Ali Antar, Abdel Fattah Ismail, and Muhammad Ali Haitham, who became prime minister. This group took an extreme leftist line, declaring its support for the Palestinians and the Dhofar Revolution, and strengthening its relationship with the Soviet Union. West Germany severed its relationship with the state due to its recognition of East Germany, and the United States also severed its relationship in October 1969. The new powers issued a new constitution, nationalised foreign banks and insurance companies, and changed the name of the country to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in line with the Marxist–Leninist approach they followed. A centrally planned economy was established. The port of Aden was the largest source of national income for the Republic of South Yemen, but the closure of the Suez Canal by Egypt between 1967 and 1975 - reduced commercial activities in the port.\nSalem Rabie Ali wanted to adopt a practical approach, so he communicated with the President of North Yemen, Ibrahim al-Hamdi, and made attempts to restore normal relations with Western countries. During his presidency, relations between South Yemen and Saudi Arabia were established in 1976. President Salmin, as he is known, coveted more Soviet support, so the contract with Saudi Arabia worried him. The Soviets pushed them to increase aid, but relations with Saudi Arabia became strained again in 1977 following the assassination of North Yemeni President Ibrahim al-Hamdi. It is believed that Salem Rabie Ali orchestrated the assassination of Ahmed Hussein al-Ghashmi in revenge for Ibrahim al-Hamdi. Salem Rabie Ali was subjected to a quick trial that ended with his execution and Abdel Fattah Ismail assuming the presidency of South Yemen. Relations with North Yemen became tense, due to Fattah's support for the factions opposing Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was more fanatical than his predecessors. Relations with the Soviet Union became active in an unprecedented way, so the Front War broke out in 1978, in which the Soviet Union and the United States intervened.\nAli Nasser Muhammad was able to force Abd al-Fattah Ismail al-Jawfi to resign for \"health reasons\", and Ismail was exiled to Moscow two years after he assumed the presidency. Despite the approach of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and its removal of tribal aspects, tribalism remained alive among politicians and the public despite the exposure of its sheikhs. Tribes from their authorities. Tribal and regional favouritism and nepotism remained rife in southern Yemen, as political forces called on their tribal and regional affiliations during crises.\n\nBy January 1986, Aden was torn apart by the rivalry of two factions in the ruling Socialist Party, when President Ali Nasser Muhammad's guards launched a surprise attack on the political party's office in Aden on January 13, 1986. This was the beginning of the 1986 civil war in South Yemen. The basis of the war was regional. Ali Nasser Muhammad was from Abyan Governorate, while most of those killed in the political party office were from Al-Dhalea and Lahj. Military brigades from those areas bombed Aden from land and sea, forcing Ali Nasser Muhammad to flee and hundreds of thousands of civilians and soldiers to flee to northern Yemen, including Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi. This was followed by systematic killings and liquidations against the people of Abyan Governorate, on charges that they were collaborating with Ali Nasser Muhammad. Nearly ten thousand people were killed and thousands migrated towards North Yemen, most of whom were from Abyan and Shabwa.\nWith the unification of north and south Yemen in 1990, Aden was no longer a national capital but remained the capital of Aden Governorate which covered an area similar to that of the Aden Colony.\nOn 29 December 1992, Al Qaeda conducted its first known terrorist attack in Aden, bombing the Gold Mohur Hotel, where US servicemen were known to have been staying en route to Somalia for Operation Restore Hope. A Yemeni and an Austrian tourist died in the attack.\n\nThat war marked the end of the state of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, and Haider Abu Bakr Al-Attas assumed the presidency until May 22, 1990, the unity of South Yemen with North Yemen, and the establishment of the Republic of Yemen. At that time, Ali Salem Al-Baidh was considered Ali Abdullah Saleh's deputy, and Haider Abu Bakr Al-Attas was considered prime minister, and after the 1993 elections. Conflicts began within the ruling coalition, and Vice President Ali Salem Al-Beidh retreated to Aden in August 1993. The general security situation in the country deteriorated, and the complete integration of the two armies failed. The southern forces, which were transferred to Amran, clashed with the northern forces there, and the forces of the northern giants, which were transferred to Amran, clashed. Abyan with the southern forces, and the political parties signed the 1994 Covenant and Agreement, in the Jordanian capital, on February 20, 1994, in an attempt to end the crisis, and successive events led to the outbreak of the Summer 1994 civil war, and the southern military leaders who fled after the events of 1986 joined the ranks of the forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and supported the Unity Army in the war against their former comrades in 1994 in the war against the separatists. At the forefront of these emerged a group of the brightest officers, such as President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, who became Minister of Defense at the time, the former Chief of Staff, Major General Abdullah Aliwa, and Major General Salem Qatan, who was assassinated by an Al-Qaeda gunman. After the war, Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi was appointed Vice President of the Republic, and remained in office. He held his position until 2012, when he was elected president of the country.\nMembers of al Qaeda attempted to bomb the US guided-missile destroyer The Sullivans at the port of Aden as part of the 2000 millennium attack plots. The boat that had the explosives in it sank, forcing the planned attack to be aborted.\nThe bombing attack on destroyer USS Cole took place in Aden on 12 October 2000.\nIn 2007 growing dissatisfaction with unification led to the formation of the secessionist South Yemen Movement. According to The New York Times, the Movement's mainly underground leadership includes socialists, Islamists and individuals desiring a return to the perceived benefits of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.\n\nTemporary capital and civil war\nAden remained in a state of political stagnation for 25 years until President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi took refuge there and carried out his work from the Republican Palace in Aden. Hadi declared Aden the temporary capital on March 7, 2015, instead of Sana’a, which he described as occupied by the Houthis. This was after the Houthis took control of Sanaa on September 21, 2014, and imposed a siege on the Republican Palace and the home of President Hadi on January 20. Hadi submitted his resignation on January 22 to Parliament, which did not hold a session to accept or reject the resignation, and Hadi remained under house arrest imposed by the Houthis. Until he was able to leave for Aden on February 21, 2015, he retracted his resignation, and announced a statement in which he said, \"All decisions taken since September 21 are invalid and have no legitimacy.\"\nPresident Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi fled to Aden, his hometown, in February 2015 after being deposed in the coup d'état that many consider to be the start of the Yemeni civil war. Others consider that the civil war began in September 2014 when Houthi forces took over the capital city Sana'a, which was followed by a rapid Houthi takeover of the government.\nHadi declared in Aden that he was still Yemen's legitimate president and called on state institutions and loyal officials to relocate to Aden. In a televised speech on 21 March 2015, he declared Aden to be Yemen's \"economic and temporary capital\" while Sana'a is controlled by the Houthis.\nAden was hit by violence in the aftermath of the coup d'état, with forces loyal to Hadi clashing with those loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh in a battle for Aden International Airport on 19 March 2015. After the airport battle, the entire city became a battleground for the Battle of Aden, which left large parts of the city in ruins and has killed at least 198 people since 25 March 2015.\nSome Arab and foreign embassies were transferred to Aden, and Defense Minister Mahmoud Al-Subaihi was able to leave Sanaa for Aden and met with President Hadi. On March 4, 2016, unidentified gunmen stormed the Mother Teresa House in the city and killed sixteen people, including four nuns. A number of the old city's churches have also been destroyed by Islamic extremists since mid-2015.\nOn 14 July 2015, the Saudi Arabian Army launched an offensive to win control of the city. Within three days, the city was cleared of Houthi rebels, ending the Battle of Aden with a coalition victory.\nBeginning on 28 January 2018, separatists loyal to the Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized control of the Yemeni government headquarters in Aden in a coup d'état against the Hadi-led government.\nOn 30 December 2020, the undersecretary of labour and deputy minister of public works were killed along with between 20 and 30 others at the Aden airport while they conducted an international press briefing about their new arrangements with the STC, which includes the partition of forces inside Aden, as they returned from hiding in the Saudi capital. Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed, his ministers and his entourage were conducted to safety under the barrage of hostile fire.\n\nCulture\nDialects\nThe entry of the Yemenis into Islam contributed to their abandoning their ancient script and replacing it with the late Nabataean alphabet in which the Qur’an was written. Today, Yemenis speak Arabic in the Yemeni dialect, which is a developed dialect and closely linked to the ancient language. It has three dialects with branches: the Sanani dialect, the Hadrami dialect, and the Taizi-Adeni dialect, in addition to the Bedouin dialect of the residents of Marib. Al-Jawf, Shabwa, and Inner Hadhramaut, and each of these dialects has characteristics and features.\n\nMusic and poetry\nAdeni art or the Adeniyat is an art of Arabic music. Among the ancient artists of Aden are Iskander Thabet Saleh and Muhammad Murshid Naji, and among the poets are Abdul Rahman Ibrahim Muhammad, Ahmed Ghaleb Muhammad Al-Jabri, Abdullah Abdul Karim Muhammad, Ali Abdullah Jaafar Aman, Farid Muhammad Barakat, Lotfi Jaafar Aman, and Mohsen Ali Brik.\n\"Adeni music\" played a major role in Aden society, and artists in the Aden dialect were called \"al-Mutariba\", meaning people of music. Adeni music began in 1920 when the army of the Aden Protectorate was formed, and after it the National Guard, where there were teams for those forces and those teams participated On special occasions and weddings.\n\nSports\nPre-independence\nThe first beginning of Adenian sports dates back to the year 1902, when the Adeni Tennis Club was established, with its headquarters in the Al-Qatee’ neighbourhood in Crater, and Youssef Muhammad Khan founded the \"Recreational Club United\" in the city of Crater, and it was known as the Yousef Khan Stadium. The city of Aden is considered the first city in which sports were practiced in the Arabian Peninsula, and the first private club in Aden was founded in 1905 under the name \"Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club\", as the first sports club in Yemen and the Arab world. He was fighting the occupation army divisions and the fleet divisions coming and passing to the port of Aden.\nIn 1924, the \"Al-Husseini Sports Club\" was founded in Crater, and a third club appeared in Tawahi under the name \"Al-Bamboot Club\" and Sheikh Othman. The 1930s witnessed the emergence of a number of clubs. In 1933, the \"Nujoom Al-Layl Club\", Al-Aidrousi Club, and Nujoom Al-Sabah Club appeared in Crater, and in Tawahi, the \"Al-Ittihad Al-Islami Club\" (Al-Mawlada) appeared.\nUntil that year, football matches were played in a friendly manner between the teams of the Crater, Al-Tawahi, and Sheikh Othman regions, as there were no federations regulating sports activity. In 1934, the occupation authority announced the establishment of a sports association called the \"Adeniya Sports Association\", after the increasing number of local clubs. Its members were appointed by the Governor-General of Aden, and all of its members were English, headed by the English Governor of Aden, Bernard Reilly, as sponsor. The association's board of directors consists of Hikam Bottom as president, the Indian Rosario as secretary, and two other members.\nThis association began holding the first club tournament, which was the \"Rosario Cup Championship\". Six clubs participated in the tournament, three from Crater (Al-Ittihad Al-Mohammadi, Al-Husseini, and Nojoom Al-Layl), from Al-Tawahi (Al-Mawalda, and Al-Bamiot), and from Sheikh Othman, Sheikh Othman Club, which includes Players from various small teams in the Sheikh Othman area, and Al-Ittihad Al-Mohammadi Club won this championship.\nAmong the most important tournaments held in Aden before independence were the Rosario Cup, the Riley Cup, the Somali Bassem Al-Nar Cup, the Aramco Cup, and the Kik Muncherji Championship.\n\nPost-independence\nAfter independence, the \"Football Federation\" was established on January 18, 1968, on the ruins of the \"Adeniya Sports Association\". The Federation took a decision regarding the Adeniya clubs, which had numbered about 64 sports clubs, reducing and merging the clubs in Aden and Lahj to only 16 clubs, and the clubs were forced to join or unite with large teams. In February 1968, several sports clubs were abolished, leaving only 12 clubs remaining. In December 1968, Al-Islah Club and Al-Shaab Club were merged into one club under the name of the latter in Al-Tawahi. In 1969, the Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club and Al-Tadamon Club were united in Crater, under the name Al-Tadamon Al-Muhammadi Club.\nIn the \"First General Sports Conference\" in 1973, the clubs were merged and reduced again, so that their number became only 7 clubs: Al-Ahrar Club, Al-Ahly Club, Shamsan Club, Al-Shaab Club, Al-Hilal Club, United Youth Club, and Aden Tennis Club. On July 18, 1975, the stage of forming urban clubs, and the beginning of the stage of politicisation of the clubs in favour of the National Liberation Front, took place. It was decided to change their names and reduce them to become 5 clubs: Al-Tilal Club, Shamsan Club, Al-Minaa Club, Al-Wahda Club, and Al-Shoula Club.\nOn July 18, 1975, the \"Al-Tilal Sports Club\" appeared, headed by Yassin Saeed Noman, as a new name for the \"Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club\", which was founded in 1905, and in 1976 the \"Yemeni Football Federation\" appeared. Al-Tilal Club participated in the \"September 26 Cup Competition\" in 1980, as the first football competition in which it participated with teams from northern and southern Yemen, such as the national team of Ibb Governorate, Taiz Governorate, Hadhramaut Governorate, Lahj and Hodeidah, at the Shaheed Al-Dharafi Stadium in Sana’a, and Al-Hilal was crowned champion of the September 26 Cup, after victory over Hodeidah national team by five clean goals.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Aden. There are 9 stadiums in Aden, including the May 22 International Stadium, and 10 sports clubs. In November 2010, Aden hosted the 2010 Arabian Gulf Football Cup.\n\nTourist sites\nAden has several historical and natural sites of interest to visitors. These include:\n\nThe historical British churches, one of which lies empty and semi-derelict in 2019.\nThe Zoroastrian Temple\nThe Cisterns of Tawila—an ancient water-catchment system located in the sub-centre of Crater\nSira Fortress\nThe Aden Minaret\nLittle Ben, a miniature Big Ben Clock Tower overlooking Steamer Point. Built during the colonial period, this was restored in 2012 after 3 decades of neglect since the British withdrawal of 1967.\nThe Landing Pier at Steamer Point is a 19th-century building used by visiting dignitaries during the colonial period, most notably Queen Elizabeth during her 1954 visit to the colony. This building was hit by an airstrike in 2015 and is currently in the process of being restored in 2019.\nThe Crescent Hotel which contained a number of artifacts relating to the Royal Visit of 1954 and which currently remains derelict as a result of a recent airstrike.\nThe Palace of the Sultanate of Lahej/National Museum—The National Museum was founded in 1966 and is located in what used to be the Palace of the Sultanate of Lahej. Northern forces robbed it during the 1994 Civil War, but its collection of pieces remains one of the biggest in Yemen.\nThe Aden Military Museum which features a painting depicting the 20 June 1967 ambush by Arab Police Barracks on a British Army unit when a number of the 22 soldiers killed that day were driving in two Land Rovers on Queen Arwa Road, Crater.\nThe Rimbaud House, which opened in 1991, is the two-story house of French poet Arthur Rimbaud who lived in Aden from 1880 to 1891. Rimbaud moved to Aden on his way to Ethiopia in an attempt for a new life. As of the late 1990s, the first floor of the house belonged to the French Consulate, a cultural centre and a library. The house is located in al-Tawahi—the European Quarter of Aden—and is politically and culturally debated for its French nature in an area previously colonised by Britain.\nThe fortifications of Jebal Hadid and Jebal Shamsan\nThe beaches of Aden and Little Aden—Some of the popular beaches in Aden consist of Lover's Bay Beach, Elephant Beach and Gold Beach. The popular beach in Little Aden is called Blue Beach. Some beaches are private and some are public, which is subject to change over time due to the changing resort industry. According to the Wall Street Journal, kidnappings on the beaches and the threat of Al Qaeda has caused problems for the resort industry in Aden, which used to be popular among locals and Westerners.\nAl-Aidaroos Mosque\nMain Pass – now called Al-Aqba Road is the only road into Aden through Crater. Originally an Arched Upper bridge known as Main Gate, it overlooked Aden city and was built during the Ottoman Empire. A painted crest of the 24th British army battalion is still visible on the brickwork adjacent to the Gate site and is believed to be the only remaining army Crest from colonial rule still visible in Aden. In March 1963 the bridge was removed by a British Army controlled explosion to widen the 2 lane roadway to the present 4 lane highway and the only reminder of this bridge is a quarter scale replica built at the end of the Al-Aqba road intersection known as the AdenGate Model roundabout.\n\nEconomy and transportation\nThe industrial activity in Aden is represented by a group of factories and production units, the forefront of which is the oil refinery. The oil refinery in Aden is considered one of the first refineries to be established in the region, and began operating in 1954 AD. The Aden Refineries Company has facilities such as an oil tanker port, a network of storage tanks, and a centre to supply ships with fuel.\nHistorically, Aden was a station for importing goods from the African coast and from Europe, the United States, and India. As of 1920, Aden was a major commercial centre for trade in the Arabian Peninsula, and the port exported small quantities of local products to most Arab ports. Aden provided coal and salt to passing ships, and the port was a stopping point for ships when they entered Bab al-Mandab.\n\nTransport\nHistorically, the port of Aden was the main transport port in the region. Passenger ships land in Al-Tawahi District, and the city is served by Aden International Airport, which is about 10 kilometres (6 mi) from the city. The airport is the main headquarters of Al-Saeeda Airlines and its operations centre. The airport is considered the second largest airport. In Yemen, after Sana'a International Airport, it is considered the best airport in Yemen in terms of location due to the mountainous nature of Yemen. However, this airport is surrounded by the Arabian Sea in terms of take-off and landing. The establishment of Aden Airport dates back to the year 1927 when the British forces established a military airport in the district. Khor Maksar. After World War II, Britain carried out extensive urban modernisation and built Aden International Airport, known today, next to the military airport. Al-Yamda Airlines was the official carrier of South Yemen, before unification, and was based in Aden, before merging with Yemen Airways in 1996. Before the Battle of Aden Airport and the 2015 military intervention in Yemen closed this airport along with other airports in Yemen.  On 22 July, Aden International Airport was declared fit for operation again after the Houthi forces were driven from the city, and a Saudi plane carrying aid reportedly became the first plane to land in Aden in four months. The same day, a ship chartered by the World Food Programme carrying fuel docked in Aden's port.\nHistorically, Aden's harbour has been a major hub of transportation for the region. As of 1920, the harbour was 13 by 6 km (8 by 4 mi) in size. Passenger ships landed at Steamer Point now called Tawahi.\nDuring the British colonial period motor vehicles drove on the left, as in the United Kingdom. On 2 January 1977, Aden, along with the rest of South Yemen, changed to driving on the right, bringing it into line with neighbouring Arab states.\nDuring the early 20th century, Aden was a prominent export centre for coffee grown in the Jubail highlands. And also to export frankincense, wheat, barley, alfalfa and millet, which are produced and exported from Aden. The leaves and stems of clover, millet, and corn produced in Aden were generally used as fodder. Beginning in 1920, Aden was desalinating seawater to produce table salt. Between 1916 and 1917, Aden produced more than 120,000 tons of salt. Aden also produced potash, which was exported to Mumbai.\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, Aden would import goods from the African coast and from Europe, the United States, and India. As of 1920, the British described it as \"the chief emporium of Arabian trade, receiving the small quantities of native produce, and supplying the modest wants of the interior and of most of the smaller Arabian ports.\" At the docks, the city provided coal to passing ships. The only item being produced by the city, as of 1920, was salt. Also, the port was the stop ships had to take when entering the Bab-el-Mandeb; this was how cities like Mecca had received goods by ship. Yemen Airlines, the national airline of South Yemen, had its head office in Aden. On 15 May 1996, Yemen Airlines merged with Yemenia.\nDuring the early 20th century Aden was a notable centre of coffee production. Women processed coffee beans, grown in the Yemen highlands. Frankincense, wheat, barley, alfalfa, and millet was also produced and exported from Aden. The leaves and stalks of the alfalfa, millet and maize produced in Aden were generally used as fodder. As of 1920, Aden was also gathering salt from salt water. An Italian company called Agostino Burgarella Ajola and Company gathered and process the salt under the name Aden Salt Works. There was also a smaller company from India, called Abdullabhoy and Joomabhoy Lalji & Company that owned a salt production firm in Aden. Both companies exported the salt. Between 1916 and 1917, Aden produced over 120,000 tons of salt. Aden has also produced potash, which was generally exported to Mumbai.\nAden produced jollyboats. Charcoal was produced as well, from acacia, and mainly in the interior of the region. Cigarettes were produced by Jewish and Greek populations in Aden. The tobacco used was imported from Egypt.\nSince the outbreak of the Yemeni Civil War spread to Aden in 2015, the city has been struck by constant protests over a range of issues, but especially concerning electricity generation. Aden's power grid is composed solely of diesel generators and is thus heavily dependent on imported fuel. The main power plant is al-Hasswa diesel power plant, which in June 2021 had only two turbines out of five running, producing up to 50 megawatts (MW) of power in a region where the deficit hovers around 300 MW. Nawfal al-Mojamal, the plant director, said \"In its 35 years of existence, al-Hasswa station never had any kind of maintenance, except in 2016 ... when the two turbines were restored\".\n\nFree zone\nThe free zone, which was opened in 1991, represents Yemen's economic gateway and the meeting point of the continents of Asia and Africa. The free zone gains its strategic importance from the special location of the port of Aden, as it is located directly on the main trade route around the world and from the Middle East to Europe and America, and is distinguished by the possibility of providing transit services. To East Africa, the Red Sea, the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Gulf. The free zone represents a storage and distribution area suitable for Africa, the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf.\n\nGeography and climate\nGeography\nAden is located on the coast of the Gulf of Aden, and is about 363 kilometres away from the capital, Sana’a. It is located between latitudes 47 and 12 north of the equator, and at an altitude of 6 metres above sea level. It is surrounded by Lahj Governorate to the north and east, and the Governorate of Abyan is from the northwest, and Aden has an air port represented by Aden International Airport, and a sea port represented by the port of Aden, and it has land routes from the north linking it to Hajj, Abyan and Taiz.\n\nLandforms\nThe city of Aden is a coastal city, as it overlooks a large body of water, the Gulf of Aden, which in turn opens to the Indian Ocean. The shape of the city of Aden in the form of two peninsulas helped this factor to make the city of Aden unique in this particularity, which clearly affected the occurrence of the phenomenon of land and sea breezes. Which occurs due to air exchange between land and water during the day and night. Its location on the water surface also affects the daily and annual temperature range. This does not mean that there are no significant differences in temperatures in summer and winter.\nThe surface of the city of Aden slopes south, and the highlands appear in the southern part of Aden, represented by the highlands of Jabal Shamsan, whose highest peaks exceed 500 metres, and the highlands of Jabal Ihsan and Jabal Al-Muzalqim in Little Aden, which are lower in height than Jabal Shamsan, and the highlands of Aden do not differ from the rest of the highlands of Yemen in terms of In terms of composition, it is of volcanic origin, and although the mountain highlands occupy large areas of the city, their influence is weak and limited on the climate of the city of Aden.\n\nClimate\nAden has a hot desert climate (BWh) in the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system. Although Aden sees next to no precipitation year-round, it is humid throughout the year.\n\nEnvironment\nCoasts\nMost of the coasts of Aden Governorate along the coastal strip are sandy coasts, and the governorate has coastal beaches, including the Golden Coast in Al-Tawahi District, the coast of Abyan Bakhour Maksar, Al-Ghadeer Beach, and Kud Al-Nimr Beach in Buraiqa.\n\nOffshore islands\nThere are about 21 islands around the peninsulas of Aden, Aden Lesser, and Ras Amran. They are mostly rocky islands, some of which are surrounded by incomplete coral reefs, and most of them are considered fishing areas. A number of islands have many activities, especially on Al-Ummal Island and Sirah Island.\n\nWild and domestic animal diversity\nYemen is considered one of the countries rich in bird species in the Middle East due to the availability of many suitable coastal environments that helped attract many migratory birds to wetland sites, coasts and islands. The Aden region (Khor Maksar - Al-Haswah) was registered on the list of important areas of the World Bird Organization as a habitat. The last three species that are globally threatened with extinction are: the great eagle, the gull eagle, and the eastern king eagle.\nThere are dozens of bird species recorded in the wetlands of Aden and the Caltex swamp area, which are rich in a wide variety of endemic and migratory birds, including birds that are present throughout the year. There are many birds in the area, including great flamingos, dwarf flamingos, and rock egrets. And the spoonbill, the hooked tern and the seagull.\n\nPublic services\nEducation\nThere are 95 schools in Aden, including 13 kindergartens, and 82 basic education schools, including 29 schools for boys, 29 schools for girls, and 29 joint schools for boys and girls.

More than 29 thousand students are enrolled, according to 2010 statistics.\n\nHealth\nThere are 15 hospitals in the economic capital, Aden, including 5 public government hospitals, 6 belonging to the private sector, and 37 health centres. There are 34 facilities in the city that provide maternity and childhood services, and the number of specialised workforce in health facilities is 2,825 specialists.\n\nEndemic areas\nIn June 2015, the International Red Cross team present in conflict areas in Yemen during the events of the Yemeni civil war announced that the cities of Crater, Al-Mualla, Khor Maksar and Al-Tawahi in the Aden Governorate in the south of the country were areas affected by dengue fever. The health authorities in Aden said that this fever had spread remarkably and widely. Since the beginning of May, health services have deteriorated and infrastructure facilities, such as electricity, water, and sanitation, have been damaged as a result of the ongoing fighting in the city for months.\n\nMail\nAden has known mail since June 15, 1839, that is, a year after the British occupation, although the official post office was not inaugurated until 1857. Postage stamps of both Britain and India were used in Aden until it became called the Aden Colony on April 1, 1937, although the stamps of this stage It bears no distinctive sign, but the use of the number 124 as a postal code is attributed to Aden as part of the Indian postal numerical system.\nThen, when it became a colony in 1937, it had sets of postage stamps containing pictures and the name Aden printed on them. In 1939, a new postage set was issued containing a picture of King George VI, but the Sultans of Hadhramaut - who were under the umbrella of the Aden Protectorate - controlled Britain has had it since the 1880s - they refused to do so, and so Britain issued a separate postal set in 1942, but this time with the inclusion of a phrase and pictures expressing the Kathiri Sultanate in Sayun and the Qu’aiti Sultanate in Shihr and Mukalla, in addition to pictures of the sultans.\n\nMedia\nJournalism\nThe weekly Al-Amal newspaper was founded in 1957 in Aden. Its slogan was (Freedom, Bread, and Peace). The British authorities allowed only 1,500 copies to be printed weekly, and the newspaper was banned shortly after.\nIn 1958, Al-Ayyam newspaper was established in Aden, as an independent daily newspaper in the Arabic language, during the British occupation. The first issue was published on July 30, 1958, and its founder and editor-in-chief was Brigadier General Muhammad Ali Bashraheel. It stopped publishing after independence during the era of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, and then resumed publication. After achieving Yemeni unity, the first issue of the second edition was on November 7, 1990, after a hiatus that lasted more than 23 years.

      "summary": "Aden (Arabic: عَدَنْ‎, romanized: ʿAdan; IPA: [ʕa.dan]) is a port city located in Yemen in the southern part of the Arabian peninsula, on the north coast of the Gulf of Aden, positioned near the eastern approach to the Red Sea. It is situated approximately 170 km (110 mi) east of the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. With its strategic location on the coastline, Aden serves as a gateway between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, making it a crucial maritime hub connecting Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. As of September 2025, Aden has a population of approximately  1,154,000 residents, making it one of the largest cities in Yemen.\nAden is the capital and principal part of Aden Governorate, encompassing eight districts. During the colonial period, the name Aden referred to the area along the north coast of the gulf, encompassing Tawahi, Mualla, Crater, and much of Khor Maksar district. The western harbour peninsula, known as Little Aden, now falls within the Al Buraiqeh district.\n\nBefore gaining independence, Aden comprised distinct sectors: Crater, the original port; Ma'alla, the modern port; Tawahi, formerly \"Steamer Point\"; and Gold Mohur resorts. Khormaksar, on the isthmus connecting Aden to the mainland, hosts diplomatic missions, Aden University's main offices, and Aden International Airport. On the mainland, sectors include Sheikh Othman, an old oasis area; Al-Mansura, a British-planned town; and Madinat ash-Sha'b (formerly Madinat al-Ittihad), the former capital of the South Arabian Federation, now housing a large power/desalination facility and additional Aden University faculties.\nAden encloses the eastern side of a vast, natural harbour that constitutes the modern port. Little Aden was developed as the site of the oil refinery and tanker port. Both were established and operated by British Petroleum until they were turned over to South Yemeni government ownership and control in 1978.\nAden used to be the capital of South Yemen until its unity with North Yemen on 22 May 1990. It is currently the temporary capital of Yemen since the 2014 Coup d'état, hosting some members of the Cabinet of Yemen mainly in al-Maashiq Palace. It is also the seat of the secessionist Southern Transitional Council, which exercises control over the city.",

اليمن. يبلغ عدد سكانها نحو 589,419 نسمه حسب تعداد اليمن في 2004 اعتبارًا من عام 2023، بلغ عدد سكان مدينه عدن حوالي 1,080,000 نسمه، مما يجعلها واحده من اكبر المدن في اليمن، وتبعد عن العاصمه صنعاء بمسافه تصل الى حوالي 363 كيلو متراً، ويمثل سكان محافظه عدن ما نسبته 3% من اجمالي سكان اليمن تقريباً،  تعتبر اهم منفذ طبيعي على بحر العرب والمحيط الهندي فضلاً عن تحكّمها بطريق البحر الاحمر، وتشكل عدن انموذجاً متميزاً لتكامل النشاط الاقتصادي وتنوع البنيان الانتاجي، اذ جمعت بين الانشطه الصناعيه والسمكيه والتجاريه والسياحيه والخدميه، وتنبع اهميتها من كونها ميناءً تجاريًّا من اهم الموانئ في المنطقه، ومنطقه تجاره حره اقليميه ودوليه. تكتسب المدينه اهميتها السياحيه من شواطئها الدافئه ومنتجعاتها الجميله، وتكتسب الصناعه مقوماتها من مجموعه مصانع ووحدات انتاجيه اهمها «مصفاه عدن». تتكون عدن من عده مناطق هي كريتر، المعلا، التواهي، خور مكسر، الشيخ عثمان، المنصوره، دار سعد، البريقه.\nورد ذكرها في «سفر حزقيال» في العهد القديم كاحد المدن ذات العلاقه التجاريه مع صور اللبنانيه كون عدن كانت احد المحطات المهمه لتجاره التوابل التي انتعشت لمده الفيه كامله. كانت المدينه في بدايتها شبه جزيره صغيره بلا موارد طبيعيه تذكر ولكن موقعها بين مصر والهند جعلها ذات شان مهم في طريق التجاره العالميه القديم. وكانت المدينه موطن مملكه اوسان القديمه،  وشن كربئيل وتر الاول ملك مملكه سبا حمله على اوسان في بدايات القرن الثامن للسابع ق.م، وسيطر عليها،  واستطاع الحِمْيَرِيُّون اسقاط مملكه سبا عام 275م وسيطروا على عدن. وسيطرت الامبراطوريه الساسانيه على عدن في 671 للميلاد.\nبدخول الاسلام الى اليمن، كانت عدن قد شهدت فتره ركود استمرت حتى القرن التاسع الميلادي. وفي عصر صدر الاسلام كانت عدن تتبع مخلاف الجند،  وسيطرت عليها دوله بني زياد في 819م وتبعهم الصليحيون،  وبسقوط الصليحيين في 1138م استقل بنو زريع بعدن لحوالي 40 عاماً حتى 1175م،  تمكنت القبائل الزيديه من هزيمه الايوبيين عام 1226، الا ان عمر بن رسول مؤسس الدوله الرسوليه تمكن من صدهم فاحكم سيطرته على عدن، واستعادت المدينه مكانتها خلال ايام الرسوليين فحفروا الابار وبنوا المدارس وانتعشت عدن تجارياً،  وسنوا عددا من القوانين والانظمه لتقنين التجاره في المدينه. وتمكن بنو طاهر من السيطره على عدن بعد بني رسول ويصفها الرحاله الايطالي لودفيكو دي فارتيما بانها من اقوى المدن المشاهده على مستوى الارض خلال ايام الطاهريين. وتمكّن الملك الظافر عامر بن عبد الوهاب من صدِّ البرتغاليين عن عدن. ومن ثم سقطت الدوله الطاهريه وبقيت سيطرتهم على عدن. وبعد ذلك سيطرت الدوله العثمانيه على المدينه عام 1538. كان هدف العثمانيين منصباً على منع البرتغاليين من السيطره على عدن فشهدت المدينه اياماً عصيبه بالاضافه لحقيقه ان ميناء المخاء اكتسب اهميه اكبر على حساب عدن خلال القرن السادس عشر. فانخفض تعداد المدينه وتحولت الى قريه صغيره بتعداد لا يتجاوز 600 نسمه. بينما كان تعدادها يقارب الثمانين الف نسمه ايام الدوله الرسوليه.\nاحتلت بريطانيا مدينه عدن في يناير 1839،  وانتعشت عدن من جديد بعد ثلاثمائه سنه من الركود واستوطنها تجار يهود وفرس وهنود واعتمد الانجليز على تقسيم صارم بين المدينه والريف. وخلال اربعينيات وخمسينيات القرن العشرين، اصبحت عدن احد اكثر موانئ العالم نشاطاً، بل كانت الثانيه في الترتيب بعد نيويورك. وبقيام ثوره 14 اكتوبر عام 1963،  اعلنت بريطانيا انها ستخرج من عدن عام 1968 وهو ما فجّر اعمال العنف بين فصائل ما سُمّي بالـ«مقاومه» لاحتكار تقرير المصير عقب خروج الانجليز. وكان للجبهه القوميه للتحرير بقياده قحطان محمد الشعبي اليد العليا قبل خروج الانجليز من عدن عام 1967. وقيام جمهوريه اليمن الجنوبيه الشعبيه برئاسه قحطان الشعبي واتخذت عدن عاصمه للدوله.\nقامت الحركه التصحيحيه باعتقال الرئيس قحطان الشعبي وادخلت العامل الايديولوجي الماركسي في جمهوريه اليمن الجنوبيه الشعبيه وغيّرت اسمها الى جمهوريه اليمن الديمقراطيه الشعبيه وبداوا بتاميم قطاعات واسعه من الاقتصاد وبحلول عام 1974 وضع القاده الشباب الجدد اول خطه خمسيه لجميع المحافظات الجنوبيه. كان ميناء عدن مصدر الدخل القومي الاكبر لجمهوريه اليمن الجنوبي، في يناير 1986 تمزقت عدن بسبب تناحر فصيلين في الحزب الاشتراكي اليمني التي ادت لاندلاع الحرب الاهليه في 1986.\nوقُصِفت مدينه عدن خلال الحرب من البر والجو، في 1990 قامت الوحده اليمنيه واُعتبر علي سالم البيض نائباً لعلي عبد الله صالح. بعد اربعه سنوات، قامت حرب صيف 1994 واستعادت القوات الحكوميه السيطره على المدينه، اعقب ذلك عمليات نهب منظمه. وظلت عدن في حاله ركود سياسي لـ 25 عاماً حتى لجوء الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي اليها، ومباشره اعماله منها، ونقلت بعض السفارات العربيه والاجنبيه الى عدن،  التي اعلن الرئيس هادي انها عاصمه مؤقته لليمن في 7 مارس 2015،  بدلا من صنعاء التي وصفها بالمحتله من الحوثيين. الا ان هذا القرار لم يكن سوى اعلانًا رمزيًا حيث ان تغيير العاصمه في اليمن يتطلب تعديل الدستور، والذي ما يزال ينص على ان الاخيره لا تزال هي العاصمه.\n\nالتسميه\nعدن هي موطن ومقام للسفن وكلمه عدن تعني اقام بالمكان فكلمه «عادن» تعني مقيم ويقال «عدن البلد» اي توطن البلد.، ومن اقوال الجغرافيين عن المدينه:\n\nقال ياقوت الحموي: «هي مدينه مشهوره على ساحل بحر الهند من ناحيه اليمن ردئه لا ماء بها ولا مرعى وشربهم من عين بينها وبين عدن مسيره نحو اليوم وهو مع ذلك ردئ الا ان هذا الموضع هو مرفا مراكب الهند والتجار يجتمعون اليه لاجل ذلك فانها بلده تجاره، وتضاف الى ابين وهو مخلاف عدن من جملته.»\nقال ابن منظور:«هي بلد على سيف البحر في اقصى بلاد اليمن.»\nقال ابن خلدون:«وعدن هذه من امنع مدائن اليمن وهي على ضفه البحر الهندي وما زالت بلد تجاره من عهد التبابعه واكثر بنائهم بالاخصاص ولذلك يطرقها تجار الحرير كثيراً.»\nوعن باب عدن قال الهمداني:«وهو شصر مقطوع في جبل كان محيطاً بموضع عدن من الساحل فلم يكن لها طريق الى البر الا للرّجل لمن ركب ظهر الجبل فقطع في الجبل باب مبلغ عرض الجبل حتى سلكه الدواب والجمال والمحامل والمحفات.»\n\nالتاريخ\nالتاريخ القديم\nعدن ميناء قديم وذكرها اليونان باسم (يونانيه:Αραβία Εμπόριον - Arabia Emporion) وتعني ميناء تجاره العربيه وذكرت عدن صراحه باسمها هذا في سفر حزقيال الذي يتحدث عن اورشليم وجاء فيه: \n\nكانت المدينه في بدايتها شبه جزيره صغيره بلا موارد طبيعيه تذكر ولكن موقعها بين مصر والهند جعلها ذا شان مهم في طريق التجاره العالميه القديم. كانت المدينه موطن مملكه اوسان القديمه من القرن الثامن للسابع ق.م  في بدايات القرن السابع ق.م، شن كربئيل وتر الاول ملك مملكه سبا حمله على اوسان قُتل خلالها وفق النصوص السبئيه سته عشر الف قتيل وتم استعباد اربعين الف نسمه وتقديم ملوك اوسان قرابين للاله ايل مقه وفقا للكتابه التي كربئيل وتر الاول تركها في صرواح مخلداً فيها انتصاره.\nفي النصف الثاني من القرن الاول ق.م، عزم الامبراطور الروماني اغسطس قيصر السيطره على العربيه السعيده وبلوغ المحيط الهندي. واُرسل حاكم مصر الروماني ايليوس غالوس عام 25 ق.م وانتهت الحمله بنتائج كارثيه وفناء الجيش الروماني امام اسوار مارب. اسقط الحِميَّريون مملكه سبا عام 275 للميلاد وسيطروا على عدن. دراسات اثريه حديثه غير مكتمله، ترجح ان الحِميَّريين كان من شيد صهاريج المياه الضخمه المعروفه حالياً بـ«صهاريج عدن» والتي تخزن قرابه 136,382,757 لتر من الماء.\nسقطت مملكه حمير في الربع الاول من القرن السادس قبل الميلاد وذكر يوسف ذو نواس باب المندب في احدى كتاباته فقد كانت قوات مملكه اكسوم تدخل اليمن من خلاله، ارسل الامبراطور البيزنطي جستنيان الاول اسطولاً لقتال اليهود الحِميَّريين ودعم مملكه اكسوم ومسيحيي نجران، دخل الاسطول عن طريق عدن. تشير المصادر البيزنطيه ان الامبراطوريه الساسانيه سيطرت على المدينه عام 671 للميلاد.\n\nالتاريخ الوسيط\nمع دخول الاسلام الى اليمن في القرن السابع الميلادي، كانت عدن قد شهدت فتره ركود استمرت حتى القرن التاسع الميلادي. كانت عدن في سنين الاسلام الاولى تتبع مخلاف الجند (تعز) سيطرت عليها دوله بني زياد والصليحيون وبعد وفاه علي بن محمد الصليحي قام ابنه المكرم بتوليه بنو زريع واستمرت عدن بتاديه الاتاوه السنويه حتى خفضتها الملكه اروى بنت احمد الصليحي. عقب سقوط الدوله الصليحيه استقل بنو زريع بعدن مستغلين انشغال الصليحيين بقبائل خولان. استمر الزريعيون بحكم عدن ولحج وابين لاقل من اربعين سنه حتى سقطوا بسيطره الايوبيين على المدينه. دارت معركه كبيره بين توران شاه بن ايوب وياسر بن بلال المحمدي وزير الدوله الزريعيه وهزم الزريعيون وهرب المحمدي الى تعز. من اهم الاسباب التي ساهمت في هزيمه الزريعيين كانت حروبهم المتواصله مع بني مهدي في تهامه وخروج جيشهم لملاقاه الايوبيين عوضا عن التحصن في عدن.\nخلال فتره الايوبيين في اليمن، كانت صنعاء وما يجاورها اكثر رفضا لوجودهم من سواها من المناطق. تمكنت القبائل الزيديه من هزيمه الايوبيين عام 1226 الا ان عمر بن رسول مؤسس الدوله الرسوليه تمكن من صدهم فاحكم سيطرته على عدن واستعادت المدينه مكانتها خلال ايام الرسوليين فحفروا الابار وبنوا المدارس وانتعشت عدن تجاريا. فقد كان ملوك بني رسول تجاراً كذلك وسنّوا عددا من القوانين والانظمه لتقنين التجاره في المدينه.\nتمكن بنو طاهر من السيطره على عدن بعد بني رسول ويصفها الرحاله الايطالي لودوفيكو دي فيرثاما بانها من اقوى المدن المشاهده على مستوى الارض خلال ايام الطاهريين.\n\nبدا البرتغاليون بالتوسع في المحيط الهندي وبحلول العام 1498 م ادركوا ان عدن مفتاحهم لدخول البحر الاحمر. فاستشعر المماليك في مصر الخطر وارسلوا قوه بقياده حسين الكردي، قدم الملك الظافر عامر بن عبد الوهاب مساعدات كبيره للكردي ولكنه تعرض لهزيمه فادحه في معركه ديو. ارسل المماليك اسطولا ثانيا ولكن الملك الظافر رفض التعاون مع المماليك كونه نجح في صد البرتغاليين عن عدن دون عون منهم. غضب حسين الكردي وتحالف مع الامام الزيدي المناوئ للطاهريين المتوكل شرف الدين وسقطت مدن الطاهريين تباعا باستثناء عدن. سيطرت الدوله العثمانيه على المدينه عام 1538. كان هدف العثمانيين منصبا على منع البرتغاليين من السيطره على عدن فشهدت المدينه اياما عصيبه بالاضافه لحقيقه ان ميناء المخا اكتسب اهميه اكبر على حساب عدن خلال القرن السادس عشر. فانخفض تعداد المدينه وتحولت الى قريه صغيره بتعداد لا يتجاوز 600 نسمه. بينما كان تعدادها يقارب الثمانين الف نسمه ايام الدوله الرسوليه.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nكانت الاوضاع مختلفه في شمال البلاد، حيث لم يعترف الزيديه بسلطه العثمانيين وثاروا مرات عديده ضدهم اخرها ثوره الامام المنصور بالله القاسم بن محمد بن القاسم الذي تمكن وابنه المؤيد بالله محمد توحيد القبائل وطرد العثمانيين. اعتمد الائمه على مداخيل ميناء المخا ولم تكن عدن بتلك الاهميه التي ولي عليها العبادله. على اواخر القرن الثامن عشر، عقد السلطان فضل العبدلي حلفا مع قبائل يافع على التمرد على الائمه الزيديه واحتكار مداخيل عدن بينهم مناصفه. تخلص سلطان لحج من الائمه ولكنه لم يف بوعده ليافع. كان الائمه الزيديه لا يعترفون بالتوريث ويرون القتال لاجل الامامه فطالت الحرب بين الناصر محمد بن اسحاق والمنصور الحسين بن المتوكل فانتهز العبدلي الفرصه ليعلن استقلاله بلحج وعدن. كان الانجليز يزورون عدن والمخا من عام 1609 بقياده السير هنري ميدلتون الذي سُجن وصودرت سفنه وقتل ثمانيه من رجاله.\nحاول الانجليز عقد معاهدات مع الائمه الزيديه عقب اخراج العثمانيين من عدن، فزاروا صنعاء والمخا ولكنهم عاملوا سفير الانجليز معامله سيئه ورفضوا عرضه. كانت الامور مختلفه عندما استقل العبادله بلحج والمدينه، فوقعوا معاهده مع الانجليز عام 1802 تقضي ببنائهم مصنعا في كريتر وخصص مقبره خاصه للرعايا الانجليز مجاناَ، كان العبدلي يريد الحمايه الانجليزيه من القبائل. قُتل السلطان فضل بن علي من قبل مسلحي يافع ثم غزا احد مشايخ الحجريه لحج وحاصرها لخمسه اشهر وحاصرها العوالق كذلك بثمانيه الاف مقاتل ولم يغادروا الا بعد ان دفع لهم السلطان احمد بن عبد الكريم سبعه الاف دولار. ثم هاجم ال فضل عدن سنه 1836.\n\nالاحتلال البريطاني\nاحكمت الامبراطوريه البريطانيه سيطرتها على المدينه في يناير 1839، بسبعمائه من المشاه وقتلت 150 من المقاومه العدنيه. ووفقاً للروايه الانجليزيه، فان باخره هنديه تابعه لبريطانيا حطت رحالها في عدن عام 1837، فهاجمها عرب من عدن وسرقوا كل ما بداخلها. فقام الكابتن «ستافورد هاينز» بزياره عدن في 28 ديسمبر من نفس السنه، والتقى بسلطان لحج الذي نفى اي علاقه له بالحادثه، ولكن الكابتن هاينز لم يصدقه كونه راى بضاعه السفينه تباع علناً في سوق المدينه، وفقا للروايه الانجليزيه. فطالب الانجليز السلطان بدفع تعويضات قدرها 12,000 دولار دفع منها السلطان 7,808 على ان يعيد الباقي خلال سنه وان يتخلى عن عدن للانجليز مقابل معاش سنوي قدره 8,700 دولار،  الا ان ابن السلطان العبدلي رفض المعاهده، وقاتل الانجليز فنزل الكابتن سميث بسبعمائه من المشاه محذراً ابن السلطان مطالباً اياه بالالتزام بالمعاهده، فرفض السلطان وقُتل من الانجليز خمسه عشر جنديا مقابل 150 عدني وكان عدد سكان المدينه حينها لا يتجاوز 600 نسمه.\n\nحاول العبادله وال فضل عام 1841 مهاجمه الانجليز في عدن بقوه تعدادها خمسه الاف مقاتل، تصدى الانجليز لها وخسرت القبائل مئتي رجل وتراجعوا. اعلن الكابتن ستافورد هاينز عدن منطقه حره. فانتعشت عدن من جديد بعد ثلاثمائه سنه من الركود، واستوطنها تجار يهود وفرس وهنود، واعتمد الانجليز على تقسيم صارم بين المدينه والريف. عام 1872، عاد العثمانيون الى شمال اليمن واسسوا ولايه اليمن وقسموها لاربع الويه لواء صنعاء، لواء تعز، لواء عسير، ولواء الحديده ولم يعترف العثمانيون بسلطه الانجليز في الجنوب فسيطروا على الضالع التي فر سلطانها الى عدن طالباً العون من الانجليز. فسيطر الانجليز على الضالع واجبروا العثمانيين على ترسيم الحدود، وذلك الترسيم هو ما قسم اليمن الى «شمال» و«جنوب»،  وتذكر المصادر البريطانيه ان العرب لم يهتموا بهذا الخط الفاصل تلك الايام،  وكان الائمه الزيديه يقاتلون العثمانيين دون توقف، فاُنهك العثمانيون وتمكن الامام يحيى حميد الدين اجبارهم على الاستسلام. ودعا الامام يحيى القبائل المحميه من الانجليز للوحده، فعمد الانجليز لتبني سياسات اكثر صرامه لحمايه مصالحهم وعززوا من المشاعر الانفصاليه.\nخلال اربعينيات وخمسينيات القرن العشرين، كانت عدن قد اصبحت احد اكثر موانئ العالم نشاطاً، بل كانت الثانيه في الترتيب بعد نيويورك. وكانت عدن جزءاً من الهند البريطانيه الى ان اصبحت مستعمره عام 1937. وبحلول الخمسينيات ادرك الانجليز انهم لن يستطيعوا الاستمرار باداره عدن مباشره، ففكروا باقامه كيان بعيد عن موجه القوميه العربيه التي اجتاحت المنطقه، فاقاموا ما اسموه اتحاد امارات الجنوب العربي، وهو اتحاد فيدرالي يشمل المحميات الغربيه حول عدن ولكنه فشل لافتقار المشيخات للخبره في الحكم،  وعارضت سلطنه لحج الاتحاد وكان هناك خلاف بين السلاطين عن هويه رئيسه.\n\nوبالاضافه لرفض السلطنه الكثيريه والسلطنه القعيطيه التي كانتا تسيطران على حضرموت وسلطان سلطنه المهره اقامه حكم اتحادي يجمعهم، ورفض النخبه الاجتماعيه المتعلمه التي كانت مسيطره على عدن الاتحاد مع المشيخات التي اعتبروها متخلفه واميه الى حد كبير. بينما كانت المشيخات تخشى اسقاطها في اسوا السيناريوهات او نفوذ سياسي محدود بهيمنه النخبه العدنيه.\nففشل الاتحاد واقام الانجليز اتحاد الجنوب العربي، ولم يستمر لاشتعال ثوره 14 اكتوبر عام 1963. اندلعت ثوره اكتوبر بسبب قتل البريطانيين لسبعه مواطنين من ردفان، وتاثراً بثوره 26 سبتمبر، وظهرت حركات مقاومه مثل جبهه التحرير القوميه المدعومه من الجيش المصري، واعلنت حاله الطوارئ (انجليزيه: Aden Emergency) في 10 ديسمبر 1963، عندما القى عناصر من جبهه التحرير القوميه قنبله ادت الى مقتل المندوب البريطاني السامي. فاعلنت بريطانيا انها ستخرج من عدن عام 1968، وهو ما فجّر اعمال العنف بين فصائل ما سمي ب«ًا لمقاومه» لاحتكار تقرير المصير عقب خروج الانجليز.\n\nبعد الاستقلال\nخرج اخر جندي بريطاني من عدن في 30 نوفمبر 1967، وكان للجبهه القوميه للتحرير اليد العليا على حساب جبهه تحرير جنوب اليمن المحتل التي انقسم اعضائها ما بين منضم للجبهه القوميه او الرحيل لشمال اليمن، فرحل عبد الله الاصنج ومحمد باسندوه لشمال اليمن. تولى قحطان الشعبي رئاسه الدوله الجديده وتم ضم مشيخات المحميه الشرقيه في حضرموت والمهره الى الدوله الجديده. تولى الشعبي دوله جديده باقتصاد منهار، فغادر العمال المدنيين ورجال الاعمال وتوقف الدعم الانجليزي وكان لاغلاق قناه السويس عام 1967 دوراً هاماً في اقتصاد الدوله فقد قلل عدد السفن العابره لعدن بنسبه 75%.\nقسمت الدوله الجديده لست محافظات في 11 ديسمبر 1967، وذلك لانهاء لمظاهر القبليه في الدوله وتجاهل الحدود القبليه بين المشيخات البائده. وفي 20 مارس 1968 عزل قحطان كل القيادات اليساريه من الحكومه وعضويه الحزب وتمكن من اخماد تمرد قادته فصائل يساريه في الجيش من شهر مايو نفس العام، وواجه تمردات جديده من اطراف يساريه في شهور يوليو، اغسطس وديسمبر من 1968. ذلك ان كل الدول العربيه استقبلت الجبهه القوميه للتحرير استقبالاً بارداً، فانظمه مثل مصر ارادوا دمج الجبهه القوميه مع جبهه تحرير جنوب اليمن المحتل،  حيث كان القسم اليساري اكثر عدداً من انصار قحطان الشعبي، واراد هؤلاء نظاما يقود الجموع ويواجه التحديات الكبيره التي تواجه الدوله الجديده اهمها افلاس الخزينه.\nقام قحطان الشعبي بفصل وزير الداخليه محمد علي هيثم في 16 يونيو 1969، ولكن الاخير بعلاقاته مع القبائل والجيش، اعاد تجميع القوى اليساريه التي فرقها الرئيس قحطان الشعبي، وتمكنوا من اعتقاله ووضعه رهن الاقامه الجبريه في 22 يونيو من نفس العام،  وشُكِّلَت لجنه رئاسيه من خمسه اشخاص، سالم رُبيِّع علي الذي اصبح رئيساً ومحمد صالح العولقي وعلي عنتر وعبد الفتاح اسماعيل ومحمد علي هيثم الذي اصبح رئيسا للوزراء. واتخذت هذه المجموعه خطاً يسارياً متطرفاً، فاعلنت تاييدها للفلسطينيين ولثوره ظفار وقوت علاقتها مع الاتحاد السوفيتي، فقطعت المانيا الغربيه علاقتها بالدوله لاعترافها بالمانيا الشرقيه وقطعت الولايات المتحده علاقتها كذلك في اكتوبر عام 1969، وقامت القوى الجديده باصدار دستور جديد، تاميم البنوك الاجنبيه وشركات التامين وغيروا اسم الدوله الى جمهوريه اليمن الديمقراطيه الشعبيه تماشيا مع منهج الماركسيه اللينينيه الذي انتهجوه. وتم تاسيس اقتصاد مخطط مركزيا. وكان ميناء عدن مصدر الدخل القومي الاكبر لجمهوريه اليمن الجنوبي، ولكن اغلاق قناه السويس من قبل اسرائيل - عندما ضربت سفينه داخل المياه المصريه الاقليميه - قلل من النشاطات التجاريه في الميناء.\nاراد سالم ربيع علي تبنّي منهجا عملياً، فتواصل مع رئيس اليمن الشمالي ابراهيم الحمدي وكان يريد علاقات طبيعيه مع الدول الغربيه، وفي عهده تاسست العلاقات بين اليمن الجنوبي والسعوديه عام 1976،  كان الرئيس سالمين كما يُعرف، يطمع لمزيد من الدعم السوفييتي فعقد العلاقات مع السعوديه اقلق السوفييت ودفعهم لزياده المساعدات ولكن العلاقات مع السعوديه توترت من جديد عام 1977 عقب اغتيال رئيس اليمن الشمالي ابراهيم الحمدي،  ويُعتقد ان سالم ربيع علي دبر عمليه اغتيال احمد حسين الغشمي انتقاماً لابراهيم الحمدي. فخضع سالم ربيع علي لمحاكمه سريعه انتهت باعدامه وتولي عبد الفتاح اسماعيل رئاسه اليمن الجنوبي. وتوترت العلاقات مع شمال اليمن، بسبب دعم فتاح للفصائل المعارضه لعلي عبد الله صالح وكان اكثر تعصباً ممن سبقه ونشطت العلاقات مع الاتحاد السوفيتي على نحو غير مسبوق، فقامت حرب الجبهه عام 1978 تدخل فيها الاتحاد السوفيتي والولايات المتحده.\n\nتمكن علي ناصر محمد من اجبار عبد الفتاح اسماعيل الجوفي على الاستقاله لـ«اسباب صحيه» ونفي اسماعيل الى موسكو بعد اقل من سنتين على توليه الرئاسه،  رغم منهج جمهوريه اليمن الديمقراطيه الشعبيه وازالتها للمظاهر القبليه، الا ان القبيله بقيت حيه في السياسيين والعامه رغم تعريه مشايخ القبائل من سلطاتهم، فالمحاباه والمحسوبيه القبليه والمناطقيه بقيت في جنوب اليمن اذ كانت القوى السياسيه تستدعي انتمائتها القبليه والمناطقيه خلال الازمات.\nوبحلول يناير 1986 كانت عدن ممزقه بسبب تناحر فصيلين في الحزب الاشتراكي الحاكم، عندما اقدم حراس الرئيس علي ناصر محمد على هجوم مفاجئ على مكتب الحزب السياسي في عدن في 13 يناير 1986، فكانت تلك بدايه حرب 1986 الاهليه في جنوب اليمن. كان اساس الحرب مناطقيا، فعلي ناصر محمد من محافظه ابين بينما كان جل المقتولين في مكتب الحزب السياسي من الضالع ولحج. فقامت الويه عسكريه من تلك المناطق بقصف عدن من البر والبحر، مما اجبر علي ناصر محمد على الهرب ونزح مئات الالاف من المدنيين والعسكريين لشمال اليمن منهم عبد ربه منصور هادي. ولحق ذلك عمليات قتل وتصفيه ممنهجه ضد ابناء محافظه ابين، بتهمه انهم كانوا متعاونين مع علي ناصر محمد، فقُتل قرابه عشره الاف شخص وهاجر الالاف نحو اليمن الشمالي جلهم كان من ابين وشبوه.\n\nوشكلت تلك الحرب نهايه دوله جمهوريه اليمن الديمقراطيه الشعبيه وتولى حيدر ابو بكر العطاس الرئاسه حتى 22 مايو 1990 واندماج اليمن الجنوبي مع اليمن الشمالي وقيام الجمهوريه اليمنيه، واعتبر حينها علي سالم البيض نائبا لعلي عبد الله صالح، وحيدر ابو بكر العطاس رئيساً للحكومه، وبعد انتخابات 1993، بدات الصراعات ضمن الائتلاف الحاكم وقام نائب الرئيس علي سالم البيض بالاعتكاف في عدن، في اغسطس 1993 وتدهور الوضع الامني العام في البلاد، وفشل الدمج التام للجيشين، فاشتبكت القوات الجنوبيه التي نُقلت الى عمران مع القوات الشماليه هناك، واشتبكت قوات العمالقه الشماليه التي نقلت الى ابين مع القوات الجنوبيه، ووقعت الاطراف السياسيه على وثيقه العهد والاتفاق 1994، في العاصمه الاردنيه، في 20 فبراير 1994، لمحاوله انهاء الازمه، وادت الاحداث المتتابعه الى اندلاع حرب صيف 1994، والتحق القاده العسكريين الجنوبيين الفارين بعد احداث 1986 بصفوف القوات المواليه للرئيس السابق علي عبد الله صالح،  وساندوا جيش الوحده في الحرب ضد رفاقهم السابقين عام 1994 في الحرب على الانفصاليين. وفي طليعه هؤلاء برزت مجموعه من المع الضباط، مثل الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي الذي اصبح وزير الدفاع انذاك، ورئيس الاركان السابق اللواء عبد الله عليوه، واللواء سالم قطن الذي اغتاله مسلح قاعدي، وبعد الحرب عُيّن عبد ربه منصور هادي نائباً لرئيس الجمهوريه، وظل في منصبه حتى 2012، عندما انتخب رئيساً للبلاد.\n\nالعاصمه المؤقته عدن\nظلت عدن في حاله ركود سياسي ل25 عاماً حتى لجوء الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي اليها، ومباشره اعماله من القصر الجمهوري بعدن، واعلن هادي عدن عاصمه مؤقته في 7 مارس 2015،  بدلاً من صنعاء التي وصفها بالمحتله من الحوثيين. وذلك بعد سيطره الحوثيين على صنعاء في 21 سبتمبر 2015، وفرضهم حصاراً على القصر الجمهوري ومنزل الرئيس هادي في 20 يناير، وقدم هادي استقالته في 22 يناير الى البرلمان الذي لم يعقد جلسه لقبول الاستقاله او رفضها، وظل هادي قيد الاقامه الجبريه التي فرضها الحوثيون عليه، حتى تمكن من المغادره الى عدن في 21 فبراير 2015،  وتراجع عن استقالته، واعلن بياناً قال فيه «ان جميع القرارات التي اتخذت من 21 سبتمبر باطله ولا شرعيه لها».\nونقلت بعض السفارات العربيه والاجنبيه الى عدن،  وتمكن وزير الدفاع محمود الصبيحي من مغادره صنعاء الى عدن والتقى فيها الرئيس هادي.\nفي 4 مارس 2016، اقتحم مسلحون مجهولون دار الام تريزا في المدينه وقتلوا سته عشر شخصاً بينهن اربع راهبات. كما تعرضت عدد من كنائس المدينه القديمه للتدمير على يد متطرفين اسلاميين منذ منتصف العام 2015.\n\nالتركيبه السكانيه\nبلغ عدد سكان عدن 865,000 نسمه بحسب الاسقاط السكاني لعام 2015،  ووفقاً لنتائج التعداد السكاني لعام 2004 م كان تعداد عدن 589,419 نسمه، وهو يشكل ما نسبته 3% من اجمالي سكان اليمن. ينمو عدد السكان بمعدل 3.77% سنوياً.\n\nسكان المديريات\nيتوزع السكان والمساكن والاسر على مستوى المديريات على النحو التالي:\n\nالتوزيع الحضري\nشهدت كل محافظات اليمن تحولات هامه في نسبه سكان الريف والحضر، بين تعداد اليمن 1994 وتعداد 2004 وتمثل هذا التحول في نمو سكان الحضر، حيث تشير نتائج تعداد 1994م ان نسبه سكان الحضر كانت (23,5%) بينما ارتفعت هذه النسبه لتصل عام 2004م الى حوالي (28,64%)، مما يؤكد ان النمط الريفي هو السائد في الجمهوريه اليمنيه. وقد شهدت اليمن نمواً في سكان الحضر في المدن الرئيسه بشكل اكبر من المدن الاخرى ويتضح ذلك من خلال نمو السكان في العاصمه صنعاء ومدينه عدن والحديده حيث يمثل الحضر في العاصمه صنعاء 97,7% بينما يمثل الريف 3.3% وتصل النسبه الى 100% في عدن الا ان التحضر في المدن الرئيسيه في اليمن وخاصه العاصمه صنعاء تحضر زائف حيث ينتقل السكان من الريف الى المدينه مع احتفاظهم بعاداتهم وتقاليدهم دون تغيير ومنها العادات السيئه كما ان الهجره لا تغير من مستوى معيشه الفرد لتصبح الهجره مجرد تغيير مكان الاقامه.\n\nالجغرافيا والمناخ\nالموقع\nتقع عدن على ساحل خليج عدن، وتبعد عن العاصمه صنعاء بمسافه تصل الى حوالي (363) كيلو متراً، وتقع بين دائرتي عرض 47- 12 شمال خط الاستواء،  وعلى ارتفاع 6 متر عن مستوى سطح البحر، وتحيط بها محافظه لحج من الشمال والشرق، ومحافظه ابين من الشمال الغربي، ولعدن منفذ جوي يتمثل في مطار عدن الدولي، ومنفذ بحري يتمثل في ميناء عدن، ولها طرق بريه من الشمال يربطها بلحج وابين وتعز.\n\nالتضاريس\nمدينه عدن مدينه ساحليه، حيث تطل على مسطح مائي كبير هو خليج عدن، الذي بدوره ينفتح على المحيط الهندي، كما ان شكل مدينه عدن بشكل شبه جزيرتين ساعد هذا العامل لتنفرد مدينه عدن بهذه الخصوصيه مما اثر ذلك بشكل واضح في حدوث ظاهره نسيم البر والبحر، التي تحدث بفعل التبادل الهوائي لليابسه والماء اثناء الليل والنهار، كما اثر موقعها من السطح المائي في المدى الحراري اليومي والسنوي، ولا يعني ذلك بانه لا توجد فروق كبيره في درجات الحراره بالنسبه للصيف والشتاء.\nينحدر سطح مدينه عدن جنوباً، وتظهر المرتفعات في الجزء الجنوبي من عدن متمثله في مرتفعات جبل شمسان التي تزيد اعلى قممها عن 500م، ومرتفعات جبل احسان وجبل المزلقم في عدن الصغرى، وهي اقل ارتفاعاً من جبل شمسان، ولا تختلف مرتفعات عدن عن بقيه مرتفعات اليمن من حيث التكوين، فهي ذات اصل بركاني، وبالرغم من احتلال المرتفعات الجبليه مساحات كبيره من المدينه الا ان تاثيرها ضعيف ومحدود في مناخ مدينه عدن.\n\nالمناخ\nمناخ عدن حار نسبياً خلال ايام السنه، ويصل متوسط درجه الحراره في عدن خلال ايام السنه بحدود 27 درجه مئويه، وتبلغ نسبه الرطوبه بين 62% - 73%.، هطول الامطار في عدن بصوره عامه قليل وغالباً ما تكون الامطار شتويه ربيعيه وتندر في الصيف.\n\nالبيئه\nالسواحل\nمعظم سواحل محافظه عدن على امتداد الشريط الساحلي هي سواحل رمليه، وتمتلك المحافظه شواطئ ساحليه ومنها الساحل الذهبي بمديريه التواهي وساحل ابين بخور مكسر وشاطئ الغدير وشاطئ كود النمر بالبريقه.\n\nالجزر البحريه\nهناك حوالي 21 جزيره حول شبه جزيرتي عدن وعدن الصغرى وراس عمران، وهي في الغالب جزر صخريه تحيط بجزء منها شعاب مرجانيه غير مكتمله واغلبها تعتبر مناطق اصطياد، عدد من الجزر قائم عليها انشطه عديده وخاصه في جزيره العمال وجزيره صيره.\n\nالتنوع الحيواني البري والاليف\nتعتبر اليمن من الدول الغنيه بانواع الطيور في الشرق الاوسط نظرا لتوافر العديد من البيئات الساحليه المناسبه التي ساعدت على اجتذاب العديد من الطيور المهاجره في مواقع الاراضي الرطبه والسواحل والجزر، وسجلت منطقه عدن (خور مكسر- الحسوه) ضمن قائمه المناطق الهامه لمنظمه الطيور العالميه باعتبارها موئلاً منتظماً لاخر ثلاثه انواع مهدده بالانقراض عالمياً هي: عقاب سعفاء كبرى، نورسيه وعقاب ملكي شرقي.\nهناك العشرات من انواع الطيور سجلت في الاراضي الرطبه في عدن ومنطقه مستنقع (كالتكس)، الغنيه بتنوع كبير من الطيور المستوطنه والمهاجره، ومنها الطيور التي تتواجد على مدار السنه، ويتواجد في المنطقه العديد من الطيور منها، طيور النحام الكبير والنحام القزم، وبلشون الصخر، وابو ملعقه، والخرشنه الخطافيه وطائر النورس.\n\nالاقتصاد والنقل\nيتمثل النشاط الصناعي في عدن، من مجموعه المصانع والوحدات الانتاجيه وفي طليعتها مصفاه النفط حيث تعتبر مصفاه البترول في عدن من اوائل المصافي التي انشئت في المنطقه، وبدء في تشغيلها عام 1954م، وتتبع شركه مصافي عدن مرافق مثل ميناء ناقلات النفط، وشبكه صهاريج التخزين، ومركز لتموين السفن بالوقود.\nتاريخياً، كانت عدن محطه لاستيراد السلع من الساحل الافريقي ومن اوروبا، والولايات المتحده، والهند. واعتبارا من عام 1920، كانت عدن مركز تجاري رئيسي للتجاره في شبه الجزيره العربيه، وكان الميناء يقوم بتصدير كميات صغيره من المنتجات المحليه، الى معظم الموانئ العربيه، وكانت عدن توفر الفحم والملح للسفن العابره، وكان الميناء محطه لتوقف السفن، عند دخولها باب المندب.\n\nالنقل\nتاريخياً كان ميناء عدن المرفا الرئيسي للنقل في المنطقه، وتحط سفن الركاب في مديريه التواهي،  وتخدم المدينه بواسطه مطار عدن الدولي الذي يبعد حوالي 10 كيلومتر (6 ميل) عن المدينه، ويعد المطار المقر الرئيسي لشركه طيران السعيده ومركز عملياتها، ويعتبر المطار ثاني اكبر مطار في اليمن بعد مطار صنعاء الدولي، ويعتبر افضل مطارات اليمن من حيث الموقع وذلك بسبب طبيعه اليمن الجبليه، الا ان هذا المطار يحيط به بحر العرب من جهه الاقلاع والهبوط، يرجع تاريخ انشاء مطار عدن الى عام 1927 عندما قامت القوات البريطانيه بتاسيس مطار عسكري في مديريه خور مكسر، وبعد الحرب العالميه الثانيه قامت بريطانيا بتحديث عمراني واسع وشيدت بجانب المطار العسكري مطار عدن الدولي المعروف حالياً.\nكان «طيران اليمدا» الناقل الرسمي لجنوب اليمن، قبل الوحده، وكان مقرها عدن، قبل دمجها مع الخطوط الجويه اليمنيه في 1996.\nخلال اوائل القرن ال20 كانت عدن مركزاً بارزاً لتصدير البن الذي يزرع في المرتفعات الجبيله. وايضاً لتصدير اللبان والقمح والشعير والبرسيم والدخن، التي تنتج وتصدر من عدن. وكانت اوراق وسيقان البرسيم والدخن والذره التي تنتج في عدن تستخدم اعلاف بصفه عامه. واعتباراً من عام 1920 كانت عدن تقوم بتحليه ماء البحر لانتاج ملح الطعام، وبين عامي 1916 - 1917، انتجت عدن اكثر من 120,000 طن من الملح، وقد انتجت عدن ايضا البوتاس، التي تم تصديرها الى مومباي.\n\nالمنطقه الحره\nتمثل المنطقه الحره التي افتتحت في عام 1991، بوابه اليمن الاقتصاديه ونقطه التقاء قارتي اسيا وافريقيا، وتكتسب المنطقه الحره اهميتها الاستراتيجيه من الموقع الخاص لميناء عدن، كونه يقع مباشره على الطريق التجاري الرئيسي حول العالم ومن الشرق الاوسط الى اوروبا وامريكا، ويتميز بامكانيه توفير خدمات الترانزيت الى شرق افريقيا والبحر الاحمر وشبه القاره الهنديه والخليج العربي. وتمثل المنطقه الحره منطقه تخزين وتوزيع مناسبه لافريقيا والبحر الاحمر والخليج العربي.\n\nالمياه\nترجح دراسات اثريه حديثه، ان الحِميَّريين كان من شيد صهاريج المياه الضخمه المعروفه حالياً بـ«صهاريج عدن» والتي تخزن قرابه 13,638,2757 لتر من الماء.\n\nاهم المؤشرات الرئيسيه لمدينه عدن:\n\nالتقسيم الاداري\nتقسم الجمهوريه اليمنيه ادارياً في اطار نظام السلطه المحليه الى 21 محافظه ، بما فيها محافظه عدن، وتقسم العاصمه الاقتصاديه عدن الى ثمانيه مديريات كالتالي:\n\nالمديريات\nالخدمات العامه\nالتعليم\nيوجد في عدن 95 مدرسه منها 13 روضه اطفال، و82 مدرسه للتعليم الاساسي منها 29 مدرسه للذكور و29 مدرسه للبنات و29 مدرسه مشتركه للبنين والبنات، كما يوجد 29 مدرسه ثانويه منها 15 مدرسه للذكور و14 مدرسه للبنات وجميعها بنظام الفترتين، وحتى عام 2004م بلغ عدد الطلاب الذكور في التعليم الاساسي 57,941 والاناث 48,081 وبمجموع 104,622 طالباً، اما في التعليم الثانوي فبلغ عدد الطلاب الذكور 11,029 طالباً، والاناث 9,643 طالبه.\nاما مراكز ومعاهد التعليم المهني والتقني والفني فيبلغ عددها 13 مراكز ويلتحق فيها 2214 طالب ويشمل 453 مدرس والمعاهد الصحيه معهداً واحداً، يلتحق فيه 864 طالب ويشمل 147 مدرس حسب احصائيات 2010. وبالنسبه للتعليم العالي توجد في عدن جامعه حكوميه واحده، وهي جامعه عدن فيها 9 كليات، ويلتحق فيها اكثر من 29 الف طالب حسب احصائيات 2010.\n\nالصحه\nيوجد في العاصمه الاقتصاديه عدن 15 مستشفى، منها 5 مستشفيات عامه حكوميه، و6 تابعه للقطاع الخاص، و37 مركز صحي، وتوجد في المدينه 34 منشاه تقدم خدمات الامومه والطفوله، ويبلغ عدد القوى العامله التخصصيه في المنشات الصحيه 2,825 متخصص.\n\nمناطق موبوئه\nفي يونيو 2015 اعلن فريق الصليب الاحمر الدولي الموجود في مناطق الصراع في اليمن خلال احداث الحرب الاهليه اليمنيه ان مدن كريتر والمعلا وخور مكسر والتواهي بمحافظه عدن جنوبي البلاد مناطق موبوءه بمرض «حمى الضنك»، وقالت السلطات الصحيه في عدن ان هذه الحمى انتشرت بشكل ملفت وواسع منذ مطلع شهر مايو بعد تدهور الخدمات الصحيه وتضرر منشئات البنيه التحتيه من كهرباء ومياه وصرف صحي جراء القتال المستمر في المدينه منذ اشهر.\n\nالبريد\nعرفت عدن البريد منذ 15 يونيو 1839 اي بعد سنه من الاحتلال البريطاني، برغم ان مكتب البريد الرسمي لم يدشن الا عام 1857، اُستخدم في عدن الطوابع البريديه لكل من بريطانيا والهند الى ان صارت تسمى مستعمره عدن في 1 ابريل 1937، برغم ان طوابع هذه المرحله لم تحمل اي اشاره مميزه، لكن استخدام الرقم 124 كرمز بريدي ينسب لعدن كجزء من النظام العددي البريدي الهندي.\nثم عندما صارت مستعمره عام 1937 اصبح لها مجموعات من الطوابع البريديه التي تحتوي على صور ويطبع اسم عدن (Aden) عليها، وفي العام 1939 اصدرت مجوعه بريديه جديده تحتوي على صوره للملك جورج السادس، لكن سلاطين حضرموت -الذين كانوا تحت مظله محميه عدن التي تسيطر عليها بريطانيا منذ ثمانينات القرن التاسع عشر- رفضوا ذلك ولهذا اصدرت بريطانيا مجوعه بريديه منفصله في عام 1942، ولكن هذه المره مع ادراج عباره وصور تعبر عن السلطنه الكثيريه في سيؤن والسلطنه القعيطيه في الشحر والمكلا اضافه لصوَر السلاطين.\n\nالاعلام\nالصحافه\nتاسست صحيفه العمل الاسبوعيه في 1957 في عدن، كان شعارها (الحريه، الخبز، والسلام)، ولم تسمح السلطات البريطانيه، سوى بطبع 1500 نسخه اسبوعيا، وتم حظر الصحيفه بعد فتره وجيزه.\nوفي 1958 اُسست صحيفه الايام في عدن، كصحيفه يوميه مستقله باللغه العربيه، ابان الاحتلال البريطاني، وصدر العدد الاول في 30 يوليو 1958 وكان مؤسسها ورئيس تحريرها العميد محمد علي باشراحيل، وتوقفت عن الصدور بعد الاستقلال في عهد جمهوريه اليمن الديمقراطيه الشعبيه، من ثم عاودت الصدور بعد تحقيق الوحده اليمنيه، وكان اول عدد للصدور الثاني في 7 نوفمبر 1990 بعد توقف دام اكثر من 23 عام، وفي العام 1998 كانت «الايام» الصحيفه الاولى في اليمن التي تقوم الحكومه بمقاضاتها بموجب قانون جزائي، وتبعت تلك القضيه قضايا اخرى حتى غدت بنهايه العام 2008 متحمله 73% من اجمالي عدد القضايا التي رفعتها وزاره الاعلام والحكومه اليمنيه ضد الصحافه في اليمن. وعندما اشتدت وطاه الاحتجاجات والمصادمات في عدن في ابريل 2009، «غطت الايام الاحداث بشكل موسع، وكانت صوَر الدماء والاصابات تعلو غلاف الصحيفه لايام»  وارسل الرئيس علي عبد الله صالح وفود الى الصحيفه، مطالباً اياهم بتخفيف وطاه تغطيتهم، والتوقف عن استخدام صور المصابين ونزيف الدماء. وفي 12 مايو 2009 شنت قوات الامن هجوماً على مقر صحيفه الايام في عدن.\n\nالاذاعه والتلفزيون\nتاسست اذاعه عدن في 17 اغسطس 1954 تحت اسم «محطه عدن للاذاعه». وتبث حالياً على فترتين صباحيه ومسائيه. افتتح الاحتلال البريطاني قناه عدن في 11 سبتمبر 1964، عقب قيام ثوره 14 اكتوبر 1963م، واقتصر الارسال التلفزيوني على تغطيه الاحياء الاهله بالسكان في مدينه عدن، وبالذات حيث يتواجد جنود وعائلات القوات البريطانيه، وفي يناير 1979 انتقل مقر التلفزيون الى «مبنى الاذاعه والتلفزيون» بالتواهي الذي تم تجهيزه، وكان حينها البث باللونين الابيض والاسود، وفي مارس 1981 بدا الانتقال التدريجي الى البث الملون، وفي يونيو 1981م بدا بث القناه عبر الاقمار الصناعيه. وبعد الوحده اليمنيه في 22 مايو 1990م، كانت قناه عدن هي القناه الثانيه الرسميه للتلفزيون اليمني.\n\nالثقافه\nاللهجات\nساهم دخول اليمنيين في الاسلام الى هجرهم قلمهم القديم واستبداله بالابجديه النبطيه المتاخره التي دون بها القران  يتحدث اليمنيون اليوم العربيه باللهجه اليمنيه وهي لهجه متطوره ومرتبطه ارتباطا وثيقا باللغه القديمه،  وهي ثلاث لهجات بتفرعات لهجه صنعانيه ولهجه حضرميه ولهجه تعزيه-عدنيه، بالاضافه للهجه بدويه لسكان مارب والجوف وشبوه وباديه حضرموت، ولكل من هذه اللهجات خصائص ومميزات.\n\nالموسيقى والشعر\nالفن العدني او العدنيات هو فن من فنون الموسيقى العربيه، ومن فنانو عدن القدامى اسكندر ثابت صالح ومحمد مرشد ناجي ومن الشعراء عبد الرحمن ابراهيم محمد واحمد غالب محمد الجابري وعبد الله عبد الكريم محمد وعلي عبد الله جعفر امان وفريد محمد بركات ولطفي جعفر امان ومحسن علي بريك.\nلعبت «المزيكه العدنيه» دوراً كبيراً في المجتمع العدني، وكان يطلق على الفنانين في اللهجه العدنيه «المَطاربه» اي اهل الطرب، بدات المزيكه العدنيه في 1920 حين تشكل جيش محميه عدن، وبعده الحرس الوطني، حيث كانت هناك فرق لتلك القوات وكانت تلك الفرق تشارك في المناسبات وفي حفلات الزواج.\n\nالرياضه\nقبل الاستقلال\nتعود البدايه الاولى للرياضه العدنيه الى عام 1902م، عندما تم تاسيس نادي للتنس العدني، ومقره في حي القطيع بكريتر، واسس يوسف محمد خان «نادي الترفيه المتحد» (بالانجليزيه: Recreational Club United) في مدينه كريتر، وكان يعرف بملعب يوسف خان. وتعتبر مدينه عدن اول مدينه مُورِسَتْ الرياضه فيها في الجزيره العربيه، وتاسس في 1905 اول نادي اهلي في عدن تحت مسمى «نادي الاتحاد المُحمدي»، كاول نادي رياضي في اليمن والعالم العربي. وكان ينازل فرق جيش الاحتلال وفرق الاساطيل القادمه والماره الى ميناء عدن.\nوفي عام 1924 تاسس في كريتر «نادي الحسيني الرياضي»، كما ظهر نادي ثالث في التواهي باسم «نادي البامبوت»، والشيخ عثمان. وشهدت فتره الثلاثينيات ظهور عدد من الانديه ففي عام 1933م ظهر «نادي نجوم الليل» والعيدروسي ونجوم الصباح في كريتر، وفي التواهي ظهر «نادي الاتحاد الاسلامي» (الموالده).\nوكانت مباريات كره القدم حتى ذلك العام تمارس بشكل ودي بين فرق المناطق كريتر، التواهي، الشيخ عثمان، حيث لم يكن وجود لاتحادات تنظم النشاط الرياضي. وفي عام 1934م اعلنت سلطه الاحتلال عن تاسيس جمعيه رياضيه اطلق عليها «الجمعيه الرياضيه العدنيه»، وذلك بعد تزايد اعداد النوادي المحليه، وقد تم تعيين اعضائها من قبل الحاكم العام لعدن، وكان جميع اعضائها من الانجليز، برئاسه حاكم عدن الانجليزي «برنارد رايلي» كراعي للجمعيه، ويتكون مجلس الاداره من «هيكم بوتم» رئيساً، والهندي «روزاريو» سكرتيراً، وعضويه اثنين اخرين.\nوبدات هذه الجمعيه في اقامه اول بطوله للانديه وهي «بطوله كاس روزاريو»، شاركت في البطوله 6 انديه، ثلاثه من كريتر (الاتحاد المحمدي، الحسيني، نجوم الليل)، ومن التواهي (الموالده، والباميوت)، ومن الشيخ عثمان نادي الشيخ عثمان، ويضم لاعبين من مختلف الفرق الصغيره في منظقه الشيخ عثمان، وقد احرز هذه البطوله نادي الاتحاد المحمدي.\nومن اهم البطولات المقامه في عدن قبل الاستقلال، كاس روزاريو، وكاس رايلي، وكاس باسم باصفه النار الصوماليه، وكاس ارامكو، وبطوله كيك منشرجي.\n\nبعد الاستقلال\nبعد الاستقلال تاسس «اتحاد كره القدم» في 18 يناير 1968م على انقاض «الجمعيه الرياضيه العدنيه»، واتخذ الاتحاد قراراً بخصوص الانديه العدنيه التي كانت قد بلغ عددها حوالي 64 نادي رياضي، قضى بتقليص ودمج الانديه في عدن ولحج الى 16 نادي فقط، واضطرت الانديه للانضمام للفرق الكبيره او التوحد معها. وفي فبراير 1968م، الغيت عده نواد رياضيه وبقي 12 نادي فقط، وفي ديسمبر 1968م، تم دمج نادي الاصلاح ونادي الشعب، في نادي واحد باسم الاخير في التواهي، وفي 1969م توحد في كريتر نادي الاتحاد المحمدي ونادي التضامن، تحت اسم نادي التضامن المحمدي.\nوفي «المؤتمر الرياضي العام الاول» في 1973م دمجت الانديه وقلصت مره اخرى، ليصبح عددها 7 انديه فقط: هي نادي الاحرار، نادي الاهلي، نادي شمسان، نادي الشعب، نادي الهلال، نادي الشبيبه المتحده، نادي التنس العدني. في 18 يوليو 1975م، كانت مرحله تشكيل انديه المدن، وبدايه مرحله تسييس الانديه لصالح الجبهه القوميه للتحرير، وقُرر تغيير اسمائها وتقليصها لتصبح 5 انديه هي نادي التلال وشمسان والميناء ونادي الوحده ونادي الشعله.\nفي 18 يوليو 1975 ظهر «نادي التلال الرياضي» برئاسه ياسين سعيد نعمان، كاسم جديد ل«نادي الاتحاد المُحمدي» الذي تاسس في 1905م، وفي 1976 م ظهر «الاتحاد اليمني لكره القدم». وشارك نادي التلال في «مسابقه كاس 26 سبتمبر» في 1980، كاول مسابقه كرويه يشارك فيها مع منتخبات من شمال اليمن وجنوبه، كمنتخب محافظه اب ومحافظه تعز ومحافظه حضرموت ولحج والحديده، وذلك في ملعب الشهيد الظرافي بصنعاء، وتوج الهلال بطلاً لكاس 26 سبتمبر، بعد فوزه على منتخب الحديده بخمسه اهداف نظيفه.\nكره القدم هي الرياضه الاكبر شعبيه في عدن، يوجد في عدن 9 ملاعب منها استاد 22 مايو الدولي، و10 انديه رياضيه،  وفي نوفمبر 2010 استضافت عدن كاس الخليج العربي لكره القدم 2010.\n\nالسياحه\nلا زالت الكثير من مواقع الجذب السياحي غير مطوره وتنقصها الخدمات جراء الحروب والاقتتال الدائم الذي يعاني منه اليمن فاليمن يمتلك اربعه مواقع ضمن مواقع التراث العالمي هي سقطرى وصنعاء القديمه وشبام ومدينه زبيد القديمه ورغم ارتفاع عدد السياح الى 176.98% في اليمن ما بين 2004 -2003 الا ان الحكومه لم تبدي اهتماما بالقطاع السياحي وارتفع معدل اقامه السياح من 7 ايام الى 16 يوم وكلها مؤشرات الى امكانيه تطوير القطاع السياحي في البلاد واشارت بعض الدراسات ان تنميه قطاع السياحه في اليمن كفيل باخراجه من دائره البلدان الاقل نماء ياتي اغلب السياح الى اليمن لزياره سقطرى والاثار القديمه والتعرف على ثقافه الشعب اليماني وفنونه الشعبيه والمهتمين بدراسه الثقافه العربيه التي لم تتاثر بمؤثرات خارجيه وذلك النتاج العزله التي فُرضت على اليمن لعقود طويله واشارت وزاره السياحيه اليمنيه الى ذلك في تقريرها الاخير بشان التنميه السياحيه بان الخدمات السياحيه متواضعه في اليمن وتنعدم تماما في القرى الصغيره التي تلقى اقبالا سياحيا.\n\nمعالم ومواقع اثريه وسياحيه\nالمتاحف\nالمتحف الوطني: للاثار، يقع في مدينه كريتر، ويطل على البحر المواجه لقلعه صيره، بني في عهد السلطان فضل بن علي العبدلي خلال الفتره 1912م - 1918م، ويوجد به مجموعه من الاثار الحجريه (تعود الى العصر الحجري) والعصر البرونزي، وكذلك مجموعه من القطع الحجريه المكتوبه بانواع مختلفه من الخط اليمني القديم. وتماثيل وحلي وزخارف تعود الى مملكه سبا ومملكه حمير وقتبان واوسان، واثار اسلاميه.\nالمتحف الحربي: يقع في شارع المتحف بمدينه كريتر، يعود تاريخه الى العام 1918م حيث كان مدرسه للتعليم الابتدائي (بالانجليزيه: Residency School) وبعد الاستقلال عن بريطانيا، وفي 1971، جرى تحويله الى متحف مخصص للتراث العسكري اليمني، بقرار من الرئيس سالم ربيع علي انذاك، وكان يتالف من 7 صالات، وبعد الوحده اليمنيه جرت عمليه ترميم له وافتتح مره اخرى في 2001م وقسم الى اربعه اجنحه، كل جناح ضم عده قاعات، جرت عمليه اعاده تاهيل لهذا المتحف في 2007م. وصل عدد زوار المتحف خلال العام 2007 الى 2008 حوالي 17,000 زائر يمني ومائتي سائح اجنبي. كما ارتفع هذا العدد الى حوالي 27,800 سائح في 2009.\n\nصور من عدن\nالتوامه\nملاحظات\n\n== المراجع ==",
      "summary": "عَدَن هي مدينة يمنية تقع على ساحل خليج عدن وبحر العرب في جنوب البلاد، وهي العاصمة الاقتصادية لليمن، وثاني أهم مدينة يمنية بعد صنعاء، شهدت عدن أحداثاً تاريخية هامة، وعرفت بأنها عين اليمن. يبلغ عدد سكانها نحو 589,419 نسمة حسب تعداد اليمن في 2004 اعتبارًا من عام 2023، بلغ عدد سكان مدينة عدن حوالي 1,080,000 نسمة، مما يجعلها واحدة من أكبر المدن في اليمن، وتبعد عن العاصمة صنعاء بمسافة تصل إلى حوالي 363 كيلو متراً، ويمثل سكان محافظة عدن ما نسبته 3% من إجمالي سكان اليمن تقريباً،  تعتبر أهم منفذ طبيعي على بحر العرب والمحيط الهندي فضلاً عن تحكّمها بطريق البحر الأحمر، وتشكل عدن أنموذجاً متميزاً لتكامل النشاط الاقتصادي وتنوع البنيان الإنتاجي، إذ جمعت بين الأنشطة الصناعية والسمكية والتجارية والسياحية والخدمية، وتنبع أهميتها من كونها ميناءً تجاريًّا من أهم الموانئ في المنطقة، ومنطقة تجارة حرة إقليمية ودولية. تكتسب المدينة أهميتها السياحية من شواطئها الدافئة ومنتجعاتها الجميلة، وتكتسب الصناعة مقوماتها من مجموعة مصانع ووحدات إنتاجية أهمها «مصفاة عدن». تتكون عدن من عدة مناطق هي كريتر، المعلا، التواهي، خور مكسر، الشيخ عثمان، المنصورة، دار سعد، البريقة.\nورد ذكرها في «سفر حزقيال» في العهد القديم كأحد المدن ذات العلاقة التجارية مع صور اللبنانية كون عدن كانت أحد المحطات المهمة لتجارة التوابل التي انتعشت لمدة ألفية كاملة. كانت المدينة في بدايتها شبه جزيرة صغيرة بلا موارد طبيعية تذكر ولكن موقعها بين مصر والهند جعلها ذات شأن مهم في طريق التجارة العالمية القديم. وكانت المدينة موطن مملكة أوسان القديمة،  وشن كربئيل وتر الأول ملك مملكة سبأ حملة على أوسان في بدايات القرن الثامن للسابع ق.م، وسيطر عليها،  واستطاع الحِمْيَرِيُّون إسقاط مملكة سبأ عام 275م وسيطروا على عدن. وسيطرت الإمبراطورية الساسانية على عدن في 671 للميلاد.\nبدخول الإسلام إلى اليمن، كانت عدن قد شهدت فترة ركود استمرت حتى القرن التاسع الميلادي. وفي عصر صدر الإسلام كانت عدن تتبع مخلاف الجند،  وسيطرت عليها دولة بني زياد في 819م وتبعهم الصليحيون،  وبسقوط الصليحيين في 1138م استقل بنو زريع بعدن لحوالي 40 عاماً حتى 1175م،  تمكنت القبائل الزيدية من هزيمة الأيوبيين عام 1226، إلا أن عمر بن رسول مؤسس الدولة الرسولية تمكن من صدهم فأحكم سيطرته على عدن، واستعادت المدينة مكانتها خلال أيام الرسوليين فحفروا الآبار وبنوا المدارس وانتعشت عدن تجارياً،  وسنوا عددا من القوانين والأنظمة لتقنين التجارة في المدينة. وتمكن بنو طاهر من السيطرة على عدن بعد بني رسول ويصفها الرحالة الإيطالي لودفيكو دي فارتيما بأنها من أقوى المدن المشاهدة على مستوى الأرض خلال أيام الطاهريين. وتمكّن الملك الظافر عامر بن عبد الوهاب من صدِّ البرتغاليين عن عدن. ومن ثم سقطت الدولة الطاهرية وبقيت سيطرتهم على عدن. وبعد ذلك سيطرت الدولة العثمانية على المدينة عام 1538. كان هدف العثمانيين منصباً على منع البرتغاليين من السيطرة على عدن فشهدت المدينة أياماً عصيبة بالإضافة لحقيقة أن ميناء المخاء اكتسب أهمية أكبر على حساب عدن خلال القرن السادس عشر. فانخفض تعداد المدينة وتحولت إلى قرية صغيرة بتعداد لا يتجاوز 600 نسمة. بينما كان تعدادها يقارب الثمانين ألف نسمة أيام الدولة الرسولية.\nاحتلت بريطانيا مدينة عدن في يناير 1839،  وانتعشت عدن من جديد بعد ثلاثمائة سنة من الركود واستوطنها تجار يهود وفرس وهنود واعتمد الإنجليز على تقسيم صارم بين المدينة والريف. وخلال أربعينيات وخمسينيات القرن العشرين، أصبحت عدن أحد أكثر موانئ العالم نشاطاً، بل كانت الثانية في الترتيب بعد نيويورك. وبقيام ثورة 14 أكتوبر عام 1963،  أعلنت بريطانيا أنها ستخرج من عدن عام 1968 وهو ما فجّر أعمال العنف بين فصائل ما سُمّي بالـ«مقاومة» لاحتكار تقرير المصير عقب خروج الإنجليز. وكان للجبهة القومية للتحرير بقيادة قحطان محمد الشعبي اليد العليا قبل خروج الإنجليز من عدن عام 1967. وقيام جمهورية اليمن الجنوبية الشعبية برئاسة قحطان الشعبي واتخذت عدن عاصمة للدولة.\nقامت الحركة التصحيحية باعتقال الرئيس قحطان الشعبي وأدخلت العامل الأيديولوجي الماركسي في جمهورية اليمن الجنوبية الشعبية وغيّرت اسمها إلى جمهورية اليمن الديمقراطية الشعبية وبدأوا بتأميم قطاعات واسعة من الاقتصاد وبحلول عام 1974 وضع القادة الشباب الجدد أول خطة خمسية لجميع المحافظات الجنوبية. كان ميناء عدن مصدر الدخل القومي الأكبر لجمهورية اليمن الجنوبي، في يناير 1986 تمزقت عدن بسبب تناحر فصيلين في الحزب الاشتراكي اليمني التي أدت لاندلاع الحرب الأهلية في 1986.\nوقُصِفت مدينة عدن خلال الحرب من البر والجو، في 1990 قامت الوحدة اليمنية واُعتبر علي سالم البيض نائباً لعلي عبد الله صالح. بعد أربعة سنوات، قامت حرب صيف 1994 واستعادت القوات الحكومية السيطرة على المدينة، أعقب ذلك عمليات نهب منظمة. وظلت عدن في حالة ركود سياسي لـ 25 عاماً حتى لجوء الرئيس عبد ربه منصور هادي إليها، ومباشرة أعماله منها، ونقلت بعض السفارات العربية والأجنبية إلى عدن،  التي أعلن الرئيس هادي أنها عاصمة مؤقتة لليمن في 7 مارس 2015،  بدلا من صنعاء التي وصفها بالمحتلة من الحوثيين. إلا أن هذا القرار لم يكن سوى إعلانًا رمزيًا حيث أن تغيير العاصمة في اليمن يتطلب تعديل الدستور، والذي ما يزال ينص على أن الأخيرة لا تزال هي العاصمة.",
