      "content": "The Umayyad Mosque (Arabic: ٱلْجَامِع ٱلْأُمَوِي‎, romanized: al-Jāmiʿ al-Umawī), also known as the Great Mosque of Damascus (Arabic: جَامِع بَنِي أُمَيَّة ٱلْكَبِيْر‎, romanized: Jāmiʿ Banī Umayyah al-Kabīr), located in the old city of Damascus, the capital of Syria, is one of the largest and oldest mosques in the world. Its religious importance stems from the eschatological reports concerning the mosque and historic events associated with it. Christian and Muslim tradition alike consider it the burial place of John the Baptist's head, a tradition originating in the 6th century. Two shrines inside the premises commemorate the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grandson Husayn ibn Ali, whose martyrdom is frequently compared to that of John the Baptist. It is considered to be the oldest mosque still in use in its original form.\nThe site has been used as a house of worship since the Iron Age, when the Arameans built on it a temple dedicated to their god of rain, Hadad. It was later associated with the Greek god Zeus during the Hellenistic period. Under Roman rule after 64 CE, it was converted into the center of the imperial cult of Jupiter, the Roman god of rain, becoming one of the largest temples in Syria. The current walls of the mosque were the inner walls of the Temple of Jupiter (built in the 1st century BC to 4th century AD). When the empire in Syria transitioned to Christian Byzantine rule, Emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395) transformed it into a cathedral and the seat of the second-highest-ranking bishop in the Patriarchate of Antioch.\nAfter the Muslim conquest of Damascus in 634, part of the cathedral was designated as a small prayer house (musalla) for the Muslim conquerors. As the Muslim community grew, the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715) confiscated the rest of the cathedral for Muslim use, returning to the Christians other properties in the city as compensation. The structure was largely demolished and a grand congregational mosque complex was built in its place. The new structure was built over nine years by thousands of laborers and artisans from across the Islamic and Byzantine empires at considerable expense and was funded by the war booty of Umayyad conquests and taxes on the Arab troops of Damascus. Unlike the simpler mosques of the time, the Umayyad Mosque had a large basilical plan with three parallel aisles and a perpendicular central nave leading from the mosque's entrance to the world's second concave mihrab (prayer niche). The mosque was noted for its rich compositions of marble paneling and its extensive gold mosaics of vegetal motifs, covering some 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft), likely the largest in the world. \nUnder Abbasid rule (750–860), new structures were added, including the Dome of the Treasury and the Minaret of the Bride, while the Mamluks (1260–1516) undertook major restoration efforts and added the Minaret of Qaytbay. The Umayyad Mosque innovated and influenced nascent Islamic architecture by introducing a more organized and monumental design compared to earlier mosques. It enjoyed great prestige throughout its history and was regarded as a \"wonder of the world\" by many medieval Muslim writers. Although the original structure has been altered several times due to fire, war damage, and repairs, it is one of the few mosques to maintain the same form and architectural features of its 8th-century construction, as well as its Umayyad character.\n\nHistory\nPre-Islamic period\nThe site of the Umayyad Mosque is attested as a place of worship since the Iron Age. Damascus was the capital of the Aramaean state Aram-Damascus and a large temple was dedicated to Hadad-Ramman, the god of thunderstorms and rain, and was erected at the site of the present-day mosque. One stone remains from the Aramaean temple, dated to the rule of King Hazael, and is currently on display in the National Museum of Damascus.\nThe Temple of Hadad-Ramman continued to serve a central role in the city afterwards. Under the rule of the Seleucids in the Hellenistic period, probably in the 2nd century BC, the temple was formally dedicated to the Greek god Zeus, who was assmilated to Haddad-Ramman. After the Roman Empire conquered Damascus in 64 BC, they introduced worship of the equivalent Roman god, Jupiter. Thus, they engaged in a project to reconfigure and expand the temple, probably beginning in the reign of Augustus (r. 27 BC – 14 AD). The later Damascus-born architect Apollodorus may have been involved in the design.\nThe new Temple of Jupiter became the center of the imperial cult of Jupiter and was served as a response to the Second Temple in Jerusalem. The Temple of Jupiter would attain further additions during the early Roman period, some funded by contributions from individuals. The temple was further renovated and embellished during the reign of Septimius Severus (r. 193–211). The remains of the western propylaeum visible today most likely date from his tme. By the 4th century, the temple was especially renowned for its size and beauty. It was separated from the city by two sets of walls. The first, outer wall spanned a wide area that included a market, and the second inner wall surrounded the actual sanctuary of Jupiter. It was the largest temple in Roman Syria.\nIn 391, the Temple of Jupiter was converted into a cathedral by the Christian emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395). The church was likely one of the largest of the time. It served as the seat of the Bishop of Damascus, who ranked second within the Patriarchate of Antioch after the patriarch himself.\n\nUmayyad construction\nFoundation and construction\nDamascus was captured by Muslim Arab forces led by Khalid ibn al-Walid in 634. In 661, the Islamic Caliphate came under the rule of the Umayyad dynasty, which chose Damascus to be the administrative capital of the Muslim world. The Byzantine cathedral had remained in use by the local Christians, but a prayer room (musalla) for Muslims was constructed on the southeastern part of the building. The musalla did not have the capacity to house the rapidly growing number of Muslim worshippers in Damascus. The city otherwise lacked sufficient free space for a large congregational mosque. The sixth Umayyad caliph, al-Walid I (r. 705–715), resolved to construct such a mosque on the site of the cathedral in 706.\nAl-Walid personally supervised the project and had most of the cathedral, including the musalla, demolished. The construction of the mosque completely altered the layout of the building, though it preserved the outer walls of the temenos (sanctuary or inner enclosure) of the Roman-era temple. While the church (and the temples before it) had the main building located at the centre of the rectangular enclosure, the mosque's prayer hall is placed against its south wall. The architect recycled the columns and arcades of the church, dismantling and repositioning them in the new structure. Besides its use as a large congregational mosque for the Damascenes, the new house of worship was meant as a tribute to the city. \nIn response to Christian protest at the move, al-Walid ordered all the other confiscated churches in the city to be returned to the Christians as compensation. The mosque was completed in 711, or in 715, shortly after al-Walid's death, by his successor, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 715–717). According to 10th-century Persian historian Ibn al-Faqih, somewhere between 600,000 and 1,000,000 gold dinars were spent on the project. The historian Khalid Yahya Blankinship notes that the field army of Damascus, numbering some 45,000 soldiers, were taxed a quarter of their salaries for nine years to pay for its construction. Coptic craftsmen as well as Persian, Indian, Greek, and Moroccan laborers provided the bulk of the labor force which consisted of 12,000 people. The extravagant costs also attracted initial resentment among the population and criticism from some Muslim writers.     \nThe mosque subsequently held major religious and cultural significance throughout its history, while also having a strong influence on later Islamic architecture. It was commonly regarded as one of the \"wonders of the world\" by medieval Muslim authors, who praised its architecture and decoration. Some medieval authors even claim that of the five wonders the mosque ranks fourth for its superlative beauty and extraordinary cost while its decoration ranks fifth.\n\nLayout design\nThe plan of the new mosque was innovative and highly influential in the history of early Islamic architecture. The earliest mosques before this had been relatively plain hypostyle structures (a flat-roof hall supported by columns), of which the Prophet's Mosque in Medina was an important model. The new mosque in Damascus introduced a more basilical plan to this model, with three parallel aisles and a perpendicular central nave. The central nave, which leads from the main entrance to the mihrab (niche in the qibla wall) and features a central dome, provided a new aesthetic focus which may have been designed to emphasize the area originally reserved for the caliph during prayers, near the mihrab. There is some uncertainty as to whether the dome was originally directly in front of the mihrab (as in many later mosques) or in its current position mid-way along the central nave. Scholars have attributed the design of the mosque's plan to the influences of Byzantine Christian basilicas in the region. Rafi Grafman and Myriam Rosen-Ayalon have argued that the first Umayyad Al-Aqsa Mosque built in Jerusalem, begun by Abd al-Malik (al-Walid's father) and now replaced by later constructions, had a layout very similar to the current Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and that it probably served as a model for the latter.\nThe mosque initially had no minaret towers, as this feature of mosque architecture was not established until later. However, at least two of the corners of the mosque's outer wall had short towers, platforms, or roof shelters which were used by the muezzin to issue the call to prayer (adhān), constituting a type of proto-minaret. These features were referred to as a mi'd͟hana (\"place of the adhān\") or as a ṣawma῾a (\"monk's cell\", due to their small size) in historical Arabic sources. Arabic sources indicated that they were former Roman towers which already stood at the corners of the temenos before the mosque's construction and were simply left intact and reused after construction.\n\nDecoration\nThe mosque was richly decorated. A rich composition of marble paneling covered the lower walls, though only minor examples of the original marbles have survived today near the east gate. The walls of the prayer hall were raised above the level of the old temenos walls, which allowed for new windows to be inserted in the upper walls. The windows had ornately carved grilles that foreshadowed the styles of windows in later Islamic architecture.\nThe most celebrated decorative element of all was the revetment of mosaics, which originally covered much of the courtyard and the interior hall. The best-preserved remains are still visible in the courtyard today.\nBy some estimates, the original mosque had the largest area of gold mosaics in the world, covering approximately 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft). The mosaics depict landscapes and buildings in a characteristic late Roman style. They reflected a wide variety of artistic styles used by mosaicists and painters since the 1st century CE, but the combined use of all these different styles in the same place was innovative at the time. Similar to the Dome of the Rock, built earlier by Abd al-Malik, vegetation and plants were the most common motif, but those of the Damascus mosque are more naturalistic. In addition to the large landscape depictions, a mosaic frieze with an intricate vine motif (referred to as the karma in Arabic historical sources) once ran around the walls of the prayer hall, above the level of the mihrab. The only notable omission is the absence of human and animal figures, which was likely a new restriction imposed by the Muslim patron. \n\nHistorical Arabic sources, often written in later centuries, suggest that both the craftsmen and the materials employed to create the mosque's mosaics were imported from the Byzantine capital of Constantinople. The 12th-century historian Ibn Asakir claimed that al-Walid pressured the Byzantine emperor into sending him 200 craftsmen by threatening to destroy all churches inside Umayyad territory if he refused. Many scholars, based on such evidence from Arabic sources, have accepted a Byzantine (Constantinopolitan) origin for the mosaics, while some, such as Creswell, have interpreted the story as a later embellishment of Muslim historians with a symbolic political significance.\nArt historian Finbarr Barry Flood notes that historical sources report many other apparent gifts of artisans and materials from the Byzantine emperors to the Umayyad caliphs and other rulers, probably reflecting a widespread admiration for Byzantine craftsmanship that continued in the early Islamic period. He notes that while Byzantine influence is indeed apparent in the mosque's mosaic imagery, there are multiple ways in which Byzantine mosaicists could have contributed to its production, including a collaboration with local craftsmen. Some scholars argue that the mosaic techniques in both the Dome of the Rock and the Umayyad Mosque, including their distinctive colour scheme, are more clearly consistent with the craftsmanship of Syro-Palestinian or Egyptian mosaicists. Archeologist Judith McKenzie suggests that the mosaics could have been designed by local artisans who oversaw their production, while any mosaicists sent from Constantinople could have been working under their supervision. A recent 2022 study of the chemical composition of mosaic tesserae in the Umayyad Mosque concluded that the majority were produced in Egypt around the time of the mosque's construction, matching other recent studies of samples from the Dome of the Rock and Khirbat al-Majfar that came to the same conclusion.\n\nScholars have long debated the meaning of the mosaic imagery. Some historical Muslim writers and some modern scholars have interpreted them as a topographical representation of all the cities in the known world (or within the Umayyad world), some have interpreted them as a representation of Damascus itself and the Barada River, and other scholars interpret them as a depiction of Paradise. The earliest known interpretation of the mosaics is by the 10th-century geographer al-Muqaddasi, who suggested a topographical meaning, commenting that \"there is hardly a tree or a notable town that has not been pictured on these walls.\" An early example of the Paradise interpretation dates from the writings of Ibn al-Najjar in the 12th century. This interpretation has been favoured by more recent scholarship. Some of the Qur'anic inscriptions that were originally present on the qibla wall of the mosque, mentioning the Day of Judgment and promising the reward of a heavenly garden (al-janna), may support this interpretation. Another clue is an account by historian Ibn Zabala in 814, which reports that one of the mosaicists who worked for al-Walid's reconstruction of the Prophet's Mosque in Medina (contemporary with the construction in Damascus) directly explained the mosaics there as a reproduction of the trees and palaces of Paradise, which suggests that the contemporary Umayyad mosaics in Damascus had the same intention.\nIn this interpretation, the lack of human figures in these scenes possibly represents a Paradise that stands empty until the arrival of its human inhabitants at the end of time. Other motifs in the mosaics have been cited to support a paradisal meaning and the imagery has been compared with both the descriptions of Paradise in the Qur'an and the earlier iconography of paradisal imagery in Late Antique art. According to Judith McKenzie, there is a similarity between certain architectural elements depicted in the Umayyad mosaics and those shown in Pompeian frescoes (such as broken pediments and tholoi with tented roofs and Corinthian columns), as well as some early Christian and Byzantine art, which are most likely depictions of the architecture of Hellenistic Alexandria. In Roman and Late Antique art, Alexandrian and Egyptian landscapes had a paradisal connotation. McKenzie argues that the Umayyad mosaics, extending these traditions, can thus be understood as a depiction of Paradise. The possibility also remains that the mosaic scenes combine more than one of these meanings at the same time; for example, by using paradisal imagery to represent Damascus or the Umayyad realm as an idealized, earthly paradise.\n\nThe mihrab\nThe original mihrab was one of the first concave mihrabs in the Islamic world, the second one known to exist after the one created in 706–707 during al-Walid's reconstruction of the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. The exact appearance of the mosque's original main mihrab is uncertain, due to the multiple repairs and restorations that took place over the centuries. Ibn Jubayr, who visited the mosque in 1184, described the inside of the mihrab as filled with miniature blind arcades whose arches resembled \"small mihrabs\", each filled with inlaid mother-of-pearl mosaics and framed by spiral columns of marble. This mihrab was famed across the Islamic world for its beauty, as noted by other writers of the era.\nIts appearance may have been imitated by other surviving mihrabs built under the Mamluk sultans al-Mansur Qalawun and al-Nasir Muhammad in the 13th and 14th centuries, such as the richly decorated mihrab of Qalawun's mausoleum in Cairo (completed in 1285). Scholars generally assume that the mihrab described by Ibn Jubayr dated from a restoration of the mosque in 1082. Another restoration occurred after 1401 and this version, which survived until another fire in 1893, was again decorated with miniature arcades, while its semi-dome was filled with coffering similar to Roman architecture. Finbarr Barry Flood has suggested that the perpetuation of the mihrab's arcaded decoration across several restorations indicates that the medieval restorations were aimed at preserving at least some of the original mihrab's appearance, and therefore the 8th-century Umayyad mihrab may have had these features.\n\nAbbasid and Fatimid era\nFollowing the toppling of the Umayyads in 750, the Abbasid dynasty came to power and moved the capital of the Caliphate to Baghdad. Apart from the attention given for strategic and commercial purposes, the Abbasids had no interest in Damascus. Thus, the Umayyad Mosque reportedly suffered under their rule, with little recorded building activity between the 8th and 10th centuries. However, the Abbasids did consider the mosque to be a major symbol of Islam's triumph, and thus it was spared the systematic eradication of the Umayyad legacy in the city. In 789–90 the Abbasid governor of Damascus, al-Fadl ibn Salih ibn Ali, constructed the Dome of the Treasury with the purpose of housing the mosque's funds. The so-called Dome of the Clock, standing in the eastern part of the courtyard, may have also been erected originally by the same Abbasid governor in 780. The 10th-century Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi credited the Abbasids for building the northern minaret (Madhanat al-Arous, meaning 'Minaret of the Bride') of the mosque in 831 during the reign of Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833). This was accompanied by al-Ma'mun's removal and replacement of Umayyad inscriptions in the mosque.\nBy the early 10th century, a monumental water clock had been installed by the entrance in the western part of the southern wall of the mosque, which was consequently known as Bab al-Sa'a ('Gate of the Clock') at the time but is known today as Bab al-Ziyada. This clock seems to have stopped functioning by the middle of the 12th century. Abbasid rule over Syria began crumbling during the early 10th century, and in the decades that followed, it came under the control of autonomous realms who were only nominally under Abbasid authority. The Fatimids of Egypt, who adhered to Shia Islam, conquered Damascus in 970, but few recorded improvements of the mosque were undertaken by the new rulers. The Umayyad Mosque's prestige allowed the residents of Damascus to establish the city as a center for Sunni intellectualism, enabling them to maintain relative independence from Fatimid religious authority. In 1069, large sections of the mosque, particularly the northern wall, were destroyed in a fire as a result of an uprising by the city's residents against the Fatimids' Berber army who were garrisoned there.\n\nSeljuk and Ayyubid era\nThe Sunni Muslim Seljuk Turks gained control of the city in 1078 and restored the nominal rule of the Abbasid Caliphate. The Seljuk ruler Tutush (r. 1079–1095) initiated the repair of damage caused by the 1069 fire. In 1082, his vizier, Abu Nasr Ahmad ibn Fadl, had the central dome restored in a more spectacular form; the two piers supporting it were reinforced and the original Umayyad mosaics of the northern inner façade were renewed. The northern riwaq ('portico') was rebuilt in 1089. The Seljuk atabeg of Damascus, Toghtekin (r. 1104–1128), repaired the northern wall in 1110 and two inscribed panels located above its doorways were dedicated to him. In 1113, the Seljuk atabeg of Mosul, Sharaf al-Din Mawdud (r. 1109–1113), was assassinated in the Umayyad Mosque. As the conflict between Damascus and the Crusaders intensified in the mid-12th century, the mosque was used as a principal rallying point calling on Muslims to defend the city and return Jerusalem to Muslim hands. Prominent imams, including Ibn Asakir, preached a spiritual jihad ('struggle') and when the Crusaders advanced towards Damascus in 1148, the city's residents heeded their calls; the Crusader army withdrew as a result of their resistance.\n\nDuring the reign of the Zengid ruler Nur ad-Din Zangi, which began in 1154, a second monumental clock, the Jayrun Water Clock, was built on his personal orders. It was constructed outside the eastern entrance to the mosque, called Bab Jayrun, by the architect Muhammad al-Sa'ati, was rebuilt by al-Sa'ati following a fire in 1167, and was eventually repaired by his son, Ridwan, in the early 13th century. It may have survived into the 14th century. The Arab geographer al-Idrisi visited the mosque in 1154.\nDamascus witnessed the establishment of several religious institutions under the Ayyubids, but the Umayyad Mosque retained its place as the center of religious life in the city. Muslim traveler Ibn Jubayr described the mosque as containing many different zawaya (religious lodges) for religious and Quranic studies. In 1173, the northern wall of the mosque was damaged again by the fire and was rebuilt by the Ayyubid sultan, Saladin (r. 1174–1193), along with the Minaret of the Bride, which had been destroyed in the 1069 fire. During the internal feuds between later Ayyubid princes, the city was dealt a great deal of damage, and the mosque's eastern minaret—known as the 'Minaret of Jesus'—was destroyed at the hands of as-Salih Ayyub of Egypt while besieging as-Salih Ismail of Damascus in 1245. The minaret was later rebuilt with little decoration. Saladin, along with many of his successors, were buried around the Umayyad Mosque (see Mausoleum of Saladin).\n\nMamluk era\nThe Mongols, under the leadership of the Nestorian Christian Kitbuqa, with the help of some submitted Western Christian forces, captured Damascus from the Ayyubids in 1260 while Kitbuqa's superior Hulagu Khan had returned to the Mongol Empire for other business. Bohemond VI of Antioch, one of the Western Christian generals in the invasion, ordered Catholic Mass to be performed in the Umayyad Mosque. However, the Muslim Mamluks of Egypt, led by Sultan Qutuz and Baybars, wrested control of the city from the Mongols later in the same year, killing Kitbuqa in the Battle of Ain Jalut, and the purpose of the Mosque was returned from Christian to its original Islamic function. In 1270, Baybars, by now sultan, ordered extensive restorations to the mosque, particularly its marble, mosaics and gildings. According to Baybars' biographer, Ibn Shaddad, the restorations cost the sultan 20,000 dinars. Among the largest mosaic fragments restored was a 34.5 by 7.3 metres (113 by 24 ft) segment in the western portico called the \"Barada panel\". The mosaics that decorated the mosque were a specific target of the restoration project and they had a major influence on Mamluk architecture in Syria and Egypt.\nIn 1285, the Hanbali scholar Ibn Taymiyya started teaching Qur'an exegesis in the mosque. When the Ilkhanid Mongols under Ghazan invaded the city in 1300, Ibn Taymiyya preached jihad, urging the citizens of Damascus to resist their occupation. The Mamluks under Sultan Qalawun drove out the Mongols later that year. When Qalawun's forces entered the city, the Mongols attempted to station several catapults in the Umayyad Mosque because the Mamluks had started fires around the citadel to prevent Mongol access to it. The attempt failed as the Mamluks burned the catapults before they were placed in the mosque.\nThe Mamluk viceroy of Syria, Tankiz, carried out restoration work in the mosque in 1326–1328. He reassembled the mosaics on the qibla wall and replaced all the marble tiles in the prayer hall. Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad also undertook major restoration work for the mosque in 1328. He demolished and completely rebuilt the unstable qibla wall and moved the Bab al-Ziyadah gate to the east. Much of that work was damaged during a fire that burned the mosque in 1339. Islamic art expert, Finbarr Barry Flood, describes the Bahri Mamluks' attitude towards the mosque as an \"obsessive interest\" and their efforts at maintaining, repairing, and restoring the mosque were unparalleled in any other period of Muslim rule. The Arab astronomer Ibn al-Shatir worked as the chief muwaqqit ('religious timekeeper') and the chief muezzin at the Umayyad Mosque from 1332 until he died in 1376. He erected a large sundial on the mosque's northern minaret in 1371, now lost. A replica was installed in its place in the modern period. The Minaret of Jesus was burnt down in a fire in 1392.\nThe Mongol conqueror Timur besieged Damascus in 1400. He ordered the burning of the city on 17 March 1401, and the fire ravaged the Umayyad Mosque. The eastern minaret was reduced to rubble, and the central dome collapsed. Another fire damaged the mosque in October 1479, causing the Mamluk sultan Qaytbay (r. 1468–1496) to sponsor repair works. This included the reconstruction of the southwestern minaret in 1488.\n\nOttoman era\nDamascus was conquered from the Mamluks by the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Selim I in 1516. The first Friday prayer performed in Selim's name in the Umayyad Mosque was attended by the sultan himself. The Ottomans used an endowment system (waqf) for religious sites as a means to link the local population with the central authority. The waqf of the Umayyad Mosque was the largest in the city, employing 596 people. Supervisory and clerical positions were reserved for Ottoman officials while religious offices were held mostly by members of the local ulema (Muslim scholars). Although the awqaf (plural of \"waqf\") were taxed, the waqf of the Umayyad Mosque was exempted from taxation. In 1518, the Ottoman governor of Damascus and supervisor of the mosque's waqf, Janbirdi al-Ghazali, had the mosque repaired and redecorated as part of his architectural reconstruction program for the city.\nThe prominent Sufi scholar Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi taught regularly at the Umayyad Mosque starting in 1661.\nThe khatib (preacher) of the Umayyad Mosque was one of the three most influential religious officials in Ottoman Damascus, the other two being the Hanafi mufti and the naqib al-ashraf. He served as a link between the imperial government in Constantinople and the elites of Damascus and was a key shaper of public opinion in the city. By 1650 members of the mercantile and scholarly Mahasini family held the position, retaining it for much of the 18th and early and mid-19th centuries, partly due to their links with the Shaykh al-Islam in the imperial capital. In the late 19th century, another Damascene family with connections in Constantinople, the Khatibs, vied for the position. After the death of the Mahasini preacher in 1869, a member of the Khatibs succeeded him.\nThe mosque's prayer hall was once again ravaged and partly destroyed by fire in 1893. A laborer engaging in repair work accidentally started the fire when he was smoking his nargila (water pipe). The fire destroyed the inner fabric of the prayer hall and caused the collapse of the mosque's central dome. The Ottomans fully restored the mosque, largely maintaining the original layout. The restoration process, which lasted nine years, did not attempt to reproduce the original decoration. The central mihrab was replaced and the dome was rebuilt in a contemporary Ottoman style. The rubble and damaged elements from the fire, including some of the original pillars and mosaic remains, were simply disposed of.\n\nUntil 1899 the mosque's library included the \"very old\" Qubbat al-Khazna collection; \"most of its holdings were given to the German emperor Wilhelm II and only a few pieces kept for the National Archives in Damascus.\"\nIt is the burial place of the first three officers of the Ottoman Aviation Squadrons who died on mission, in this case the Istanbul-Cairo expedition in 1914. They were Navy Lieutenant Fethi Bey and his navigator, Artillery First Lieutenant Sadık Bey and Artillery Second Lieutenant Nuri Bey.\n\nModern era\nThe Umayyad Mosque underwent major restorations in 1929 during the French Mandate over Syria and in 1954 and 1963 under the Syrian Republic.\nIn the 1980s and in the early 1990s, Syrian president Hafez al-Assad ordered a wide-scale renovation of the mosque. The methods and concepts of Assad's restoration project were heavily criticized by UNESCO, but the general approach in Syria was that the mosque was more of a symbolic monument rather than a historical one and thus, its renovation could only enhance the mosque's symbolism.\nIn 1990s, Mohammed Burhanuddin constructed a zarih of the martyrs of the Battle of Karbala, whose heads were brought to the Mosque after their defeat at the hands of the then Umayyad caliph, Yazid I.\nIn 2001, Pope John Paul II visited the mosque, primarily to visit the relics of John the Baptist. It was the first time a pope paid a visit to a mosque.\nOn March 15, 2011, the first significant protests related to the Arab Spring and eventually the Syrian civil war began at the Umayyad Mosque when 40–50 worshippers gathered outside the complex and chanted pro-democracy slogans. Syrian security forces swiftly quelled the protests and cordoned off the area during Friday prayers to prevent large-scale demonstrations.\n\nAfter the Fall of the Assad regime and the victory of opposition forces in the civil war, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham leader Ahmed al-Sharaa gave a victory speech from Umayyad Mosque during which he declared a new era in Syria's history.\n\nArchitecture\nThe ground plan of the Umayyad Mosque is rectangular in shape and measures 97 meters (318 ft) by 156 meters (512 ft). A large courtyard occupies the northern part of the mosque complex, while the prayer hall or haram ('sanctuary') covers the southern part. The mosque is enclosed by four exterior walls which were part of the temenos of the original Roman temple.\n\nSanctuary\nThree arcades make up the interior space of the sanctuary. They are parallel to the direction of prayer which is towards Mecca. The arcades are supported by two rows of stone Corinthian columns. Each of the arcades contain two levels. The first level consists of large semi-circular arches, while the second level is made up of double arches. This pattern is the same repeated by the arcades of the courtyard. The three interior arcades intersect in the center of the sanctuary with a larger, higher arcade that is perpendicular to the qibla wall and faces the mihrab and the minbar. The central transept divides the arcades into two halves each with eleven arches. The entire sanctuary measures 136 meters (446 ft) by 37 meters (121 ft) and takes up the southern half of the mosque complex.\nFour mihrabs line the sanctuary's rear wall, the main one being the Great Mihrab which is located roughly at the center of the wall. The Mihrab of the Sahaba, named after the sahaba ('companions of Muhammad') is situated in the eastern half. According to the 9th-century Muslim engineer Musa ibn Shakir, the latter mihrab was built during the mosque's initial construction and it became the third niche-formed mihrab in Islam's history.\nThe central dome of the mosque is known as the 'Dome of the Eagle' (Qubbat an-Nisr) and located atop the center of the prayer hall. The original wooden dome was replaced by one built of stone following the 1893 fire. It receives its name because it is thought to resemble an eagle, with the dome itself being the eagle's head while the eastern and western flanks of the prayer hall represent the wings. With a height of 36 meters (118 ft), the dome rests on an octagonal substructure with two arched windows on each of its sides. It is supported by the central interior arcade and has openings along its parameter.\n\nCourtyard\nIn the courtyard (sahn), the level of the stone pavement had become uneven over time due to several repairs throughout the mosque's history. Recent work on the courtyard has restored it to its consistent Umayyad-era levels. Arcades (riwaq) surround the courtyard supported by alternating stone columns and piers. There is one pier in between every two columns. Because the northern part of the courtyard had been destroyed in an earthquake in 1759, the arcade is not consistent; when the northern wall was rebuilt the columns that were supporting it were not. The courtyard and its arcades contain the largest preserved remnants of the mosque's Umayyad-era mosaic decoration.\nSeveral domed pavilions stand in the courtyard. The Dome of the Treasury is an octagonal structure decorated with mosaics, standing on eight Roman columns in the western part of the courtyard. Its 8th-century mosaics were largely remade in the late 20th-century restoration. In a mirror position on the other side of the courtyard is the Dome of the Clock, another octagonal domed pavilion. Near the middle of the courtyard, sheltering an ablutions fountain at ground level, is a rectangular pavilion which is a modern reconstruction of a late Ottoman pavilion.\n\nMinarets\nWithin the Umayyad Mosque complex are three minarets. The Minaret of Isa on the southeast corner, the Minaret of Qaytbay (also called Madhanat al-Gharbiyya) on the southwest corner, and the Minaret of the Bride located along the northern wall.\n\nMinaret of the Bride\nThe Minaret of the Bride was the first one built and is located on the mosque's northern wall. The exact year of the minaret's original construction is unknown. The bottom part of the minaret most likely dates back to the Abbasid era in the 9th century. While it is possible that the Umayyads built it, there is no indication that a minaret on the northern wall was a part of al-Walid I's initial concept. Al-Muqaddasi visited the minaret in 985 when Damascus was under Abbasid control and described it as \"recently built\". The upper segment was constructed in 1174. This minaret is used by the muezzin for the call to prayer (adhan) and there is a spiral staircase of 160 stone steps that lead to the muezzin's calling position.\nThe Minaret of the Bride is divided into two sections; the main tower and the spire which are separated by a lead roof. The oldest part of the minaret, or the main tower, is square in shape, has four galleries, and consists of two different forms of masonry; the base consists of large blocks, while the upper section is built of dressed stone. There are two light openings near the top of the main tower, before the roof, with horseshoe arches and cubical capitals enclosed in a single arch. A smaller arched corbel is located below these openings. According to local legend, the minaret is named after the daughter of the merchant who provided the lead for the minaret's roof who was married to Syria's ruler at the time. Attached to the Minaret of the Bride is the 18th-century replica of the 14th-century sundial built by Ibn al-Shatir.\n\nMinaret of Isa\nThe Minaret of Isa is around 77 meters (253 ft) in height and the tallest of the three minarets. Some sources claim it was originally built by the Abbasids in the 9th century. The main body of the current minaret was built by the Ayyubids in 1247, but the upper section was constructed by the Ottomans. The main body of the minaret is square-shaped and the spire is octagonal. It tapers to a point and is surmounted by a crescent (as are the other two minarets). Two covered galleries are situated in the main body and two open galleries are located on the spire. Islamic belief holds that Isa (Jesus) will descend from heaven during the time of the Fajr prayer and will pray behind the Mahdi. He will then confront the Antichrist. According to local Damascene tradition, relating from hadith, Isa will reach earth via the Minaret of Isa, hence its name. Ibn Kathir, a prominent 14th-century Muslim scholar, backed this notion.\n\nMinaret of Qaytbay\nThe Minaret of Qaytbay was built by Qaytbay in 1488. He also commissioned its renovation due to the 1479 fire. The minaret displays strong Islamic-era Egyptian architectural influence typical of the Mamluk period. It is octagonal in shape and built in receding sections with three galleries. It is generally believed that both the Minaret of Jesus and the Western Minaret were built on the foundation of ancient Roman towers. In October 2025, nearly one year after the fall of the Assad regime, the name of Hafez al-Assad, which had been inscribed on the Qaytbay Minaret following earlier restoration works, was removed.\n\nInfluence on mosque architecture\nThe Umayyad Mosque is one of the few early mosques in the world to have maintained the same general structure and architectural features since its initial construction in the early 8th century. Its Umayyad character has not been significantly altered. Since its establishment, the mosque has served as a model for congregational mosque architecture in Syria as well as globally. According to Flood, \"the construction of the Damascus mosque not only irrevocably altered the urban landscape of the city, inscribing upon it a permanent affirmation of Muslim hegemony, but by giving the Syrian congregational mosque its definitive form it also transformed the subsequent history of the mosque in general.\" The influence of the Umayyad Mosque's ground plan can be found in many mosques in the historic Muslim world, such as the al-Azhar Mosque and Baybars Mosque in Cairo, the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain, and the Bursa Grand Mosque and Edirne's Grand Mosque in Turkey.\n\nReligious significance\nAccording to some, the mosque is the fourth holiest site of Islam. A Christian tradition dating to the 6th century developed an association between the former cathedral structure and John the Baptist. Legend had it that his head was buried there. Ibn al-Faqih relays that during the construction of the mosque, workers found a cave-chapel which had a box containing the head of John the Baptist, known as Yahya ibn Zakariya by Muslims. Upon learning of that and examining it, al-Walid I ordered the head buried under a specific pillar in the mosque that was later inlaid with marble.\nAccording to one hadith reported by Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, the Great Mosque of Damascus is the site where Jesus will descend from heaven at his Second Coming, appearing on a \"white minaret\". Most Muslim theologians interpret this passage as symbolic rather than literal. In a study of Muslim sources, William Richard Oakes suggests that some aspects of this hadith could date from the late Umayyad period, when the mosque was built, rather than from Muhammad's time, when Damascus had not yet been conquered by Muslims.\nTwo shrines commemorating the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grandson Husayn ibn Ali, whose martyrdom is also compared in Shi'a tradition to that of John the Baptist, exist within the building premises.\n\nSee also\nAblaq\nGreat Mosque of Aleppo\nList of the oldest mosques in the world\nReligious significance of the Syrian region\nTimeline of Islamic history\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAbdulkarim, Maamoun (2003). \"Syria in the times of Apollodorus of Damascus\".

      "summary": "The Umayyad Mosque (Arabic: ٱلْجَامِع ٱلْأُمَوِي‎, romanized: al-Jāmiʿ al-Umawī), also known as the Great Mosque of Damascus (Arabic: جَامِع بَنِي أُمَيَّة ٱلْكَبِيْر‎, romanized: Jāmiʿ Banī Umayyah al-Kabīr), located in the old city of Damascus, the capital of Syria, is one of the largest and oldest mosques in the world. Its religious importance stems from the eschatological reports concerning the mosque and historic events associated with it. Christian and Muslim tradition alike consider it the burial place of John the Baptist's head, a tradition originating in the 6th century. Two shrines inside the premises commemorate the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grandson Husayn ibn Ali, whose martyrdom is frequently compared to that of John the Baptist. It is considered to be the oldest mosque still in use in its original form.\nThe site has been used as a house of worship since the Iron Age, when the Arameans built on it a temple dedicated to their god of rain, Hadad. It was later associated with the Greek god Zeus during the Hellenistic period. Under Roman rule after 64 CE, it was converted into the center of the imperial cult of Jupiter, the Roman god of rain, becoming one of the largest temples in Syria. The current walls of the mosque were the inner walls of the Temple of Jupiter (built in the 1st century BC to 4th century AD). When the empire in Syria transitioned to Christian Byzantine rule, Emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395) transformed it into a cathedral and the seat of the second-highest-ranking bishop in the Patriarchate of Antioch.\nAfter the Muslim conquest of Damascus in 634, part of the cathedral was designated as a small prayer house (musalla) for the Muslim conquerors. As the Muslim community grew, the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715) confiscated the rest of the cathedral for Muslim use, returning to the Christians other properties in the city as compensation. The structure was largely demolished and a grand congregational mosque complex was built in its place. The new structure was built over nine years by thousands of laborers and artisans from across the Islamic and Byzantine empires at considerable expense and was funded by the war booty of Umayyad conquests and taxes on the Arab troops of Damascus. Unlike the simpler mosques of the time, the Umayyad Mosque had a large basilical plan with three parallel aisles and a perpendicular central nave leading from the mosque's entrance to the world's second concave mihrab (prayer niche). The mosque was noted for its rich compositions of marble paneling and its extensive gold mosaics of vegetal motifs, covering some 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft), likely the largest in the world. \nUnder Abbasid rule (750–860), new structures were added, including the Dome of the Treasury and the Minaret of the Bride, while the Mamluks (1260–1516) undertook major restoration efforts and added the Minaret of Qaytbay. The Umayyad Mosque innovated and influenced nascent Islamic architecture by introducing a more organized and monumental design compared to earlier mosques. It enjoyed great prestige throughout its history and was regarded as a \"wonder of the world\" by many medieval Muslim writers. Although the original structure has been altered several times due to fire, war damage, and repairs, it is one of the few mosques to maintain the same form and architectural features of its 8th-century construction, as well as its Umayyad character.",

      "content": "جامع بني اميه الكبير، ويعرف اختصارًا بالجامع الاموي، هو المسجد الذي امر الوليد بن عبد الملك بتشييده في دمشق، وهو من اشهر المساجد وافخمها، واحد عجائب الاسلام السبعه في العالم.\nبدا بناء الجامع الاموي في عام 705م على يد الوليد بن عبد الملك، وقد حشد له صنّاعاً من الفرس والهنود، واوفد امبراطور بيزنطه مئه فنان يوناني للمشاركه في التزيين، ونال قسطًا وافرًا من المدح والوصف، لا سيَّما من الرحاله والمؤرخين والادباء الذين مرّوا بدمشق عبر العصور واطروا بشكل خاص على زينه سقف المسجد وجدرانه الفسيفسائيه الملونه، والرخام المستعمل في البناء. الا ان اغلبها طُمس بناءً على فتاوى بعدم جوزاها حتى اُعيد اكتشافها وترميمها عام 1928. وقد وصفها المؤرخ فيليب حتي بانها «تمثل الصناعه الاهليه السوريه وليس الفن اليوناني او البيزنطي.»\nيتميز الجامع الاموي ايضًا بكونه اول مسجد ظهر فيه المحراب والحنيه نتيجه طراز البناء الذي كان يشكل كنيسه يوحنا المعمدان سابقاً. اما مئذنته الشماليه، وهي اقدم ماذنه الثلاث، فتعود لعهد الوليد بن عبد الملك. كما استخدمت ايضاً منارهً لمدينه دمشق، وكانت ستعمل خلال القرون الوسطى للمنقطين للتامل والصلاه، ومنها انتشر نموذج المئذنه المربعه الى سائر انحاء سوريا وشمال افريقيا والاندلس.\nيحتوي الجامع على مدفن جسد يوحنا المعمدان -النبي يحيى- نسيب المسيح، ولم يبقَ من اثاره المسيحيه سوى جرن العماد ونقش باليونانيه في مدح المسيح على احد الجدران. كما يحوي المسجد ايضاً على الفتحه التي وضع فيها راس الحسين بن علي حين حُمل الى دمشق. واُلحق بالمسجد مقبره تضم رفات صلاح الدين الايوبي.\nاحترقت اجزاء من الجامع ثلاث مرات: الاولى عام 1069م، والثانيه على يد تيمورلنك عام 1400م، والثالثه عام 1893م. وكانت اخر عمليات الترميم في العصر الحديث عام 1994م.\n\nالموقع\nيقع الجامع الاموي في وسط مدينه دمشق القديمه، المنطقه المدرجه على لائحه التراث العالمي.\n\nالتاريخ\nقبل الاسلام\nيعود تاريخ المسجد الاموي في سوريه الى 1200 سنه قبل الميلاد، حيث كانت دمشق عاصمه لدوله ارام دمشق خلال العصر الحديدي. وقد كان اراميو غرب سوريا يعبدون «حدد الارامي،» اله الخصب والرعد والمطر حسب معتقدهم، لذلك اقاموا معبداً مخصصاً له في موقع «المسجد الاموي» المعاصر. ولا يُعرف بالضبط كيف بدا المعبد، لكن يعتقد انه اتَّبع النموذج المعماري الكنعاني السامي التقليدي. وهو يشبه معبد القدس، ويتالف من فناء مسور وغرفه صغيره للعباده. وقد بقي حجر واحد من المعبد الارامي يعود لحكم الملك حازائيل، وهو حالياً يُعرض في متحف دمشق الوطني.\nواصل معبد حدد الارامي القيام بدوره المركزي في المدينه حتى غزا الرومان دمشق في عام 64م فاقاموا فيه معبداً للاله جوبيتر، فقاموا باعاده تكوين وتوسيع المعبد تحت اشراف مهندس معماري وُلد في دمشق يدعى ابولودوروس، وهو من صمم ونفذ التصميم الجديد. وقد اُعجب السكان المحليين بتماثُل وابعاد «معبد جوبيتر اليوناني الروماني.» وباستثناء زياده حجم المبنى، حافظ الرومانيون على معظم تصميمه الاصلي، وتُرِك الفناء المسور سليماً الى حد كبير. واقيمت في وسط الفناء غرفه داخليه، وكان هناك برج واحد في كل من الزوايا الاربع للفناء. كما استخدمت الابراج للطقوس تمشياً مع التقاليد الدينيه الساميه القديمه حيث قُدِّمت الاضاحي في الاماكن المرتفعه.\nاصبح المعبد الروماني الجديد السلطه التشريعيه الدينيه في مدينه دمشق بسبب حجمه الكبير، وكان الغرض من تشييده (وقد اصبح فيما بعد المركز الرئيسي للعباده في الامبراطوريه الرومانيه) ان يكون منافساً للمعبد العبري في القدس. وقد اضيف لـ«معبد جوبيتر» المزيد من الاضافات خلال الفتره الاولى من الحكم الروماني للمدينه، واصبح اغلب كهنه المعبد اثرياء بسبب التبرعات التي كانوا يجمعونها من المواطنين الاثرياء في دمشق. وقد وُسِّعت البوابه الشرقيه لفناء المعبد في عهد سيبتيموس سيفيروس (حكم 193-211 م).\nبحلول القرن الرابع للميلاد اصبح المعبد مشهوراً بسبب حجمه وجماله وفُصل عن المدينه بمجموعتين من الجدران. وكان الجدار الاول، الذي يعتبر الاكبر، يمتد على مساحه واسعه شملت السوق. اما الجدار الثاني فيحيط بحرم معبد جوبيتر الاصلي. وكان هذا المعبد الاكبر في سوريا الرومانيه. وفي نهايه القرن الرابع للميلاد، تحديداً في عام 391، حُوِّل معبد جوبيتر الى كاتدرائيه القديس يوحنا بامر من الامبراطور ثيودوسيوس الاول (حكم بين 379 و395 للميلاد). لكن هذه الكاتدرائيه المسيحيه لم تكن مكرسه مباشره ليوحنا المعمدان -النبي يحيى، وكُرِّست لاحقًا من القرن السادس للميلاد، اذ تشير الاسطوره المحليه ان راس يوحنا المعمدان -النبي يحيى - دُفن هناك. وكانت الكاتدرائيه بمثابه مقر اسقف دمشق، الذي يحتل المرتبه الثانيه ضمن بطريركيه انطاكيه بعد البطريرك نفسه.\nولا تزال اطلال المعبد باقيه في منطقه سوق الحريم وحتى منطقه القيمريه.\n\nالفتح الاسلامي وقيام المسجد\nفي عام 634، تمت محاصره دمشق من طرف الجيوش الاسلاميه بقياده خالد بن الوليد، ونجح خالد بضمها للاراضي الاسلاميه صلحا. بعد عقود من فتح دمشق، اصبحت الخلافه الاسلاميه تحت حكم السلاله الامويه، الذين اختاروا دمشق لتكون العاصمه الاداريه للعالم الاسلامي. وقد كلف الخليفه الاموي السادس، الوليد بن عبد الملك (705–715م) الصناع والمهندسين، ببناء المسجد في موقع الكاتدرائيه البيزنطيه في عام 706 م. قبل هذا، كانت الكاتدرائيه لا تزال قيد الاستخدام من طرف المسيحيين المحليين، ولكن قد شُيِّدت غرفه صلاه (المصلي) للمسلمين في الجزء الجنوبي الشرقي من المبنى. الوليد، الذي اشرف شخصياً على المشروع، امر بهدم معظم الكاتدرائيه، بما في ذلك المصلى، وغُيِّر تخطيط المبنى تماما، ليستخدم بصفته مسجداً كبيراً لصلاه الجماعه لمواطني دمشق ومعلماً دينياً لمدينه دمشق.احتج المسيحيون على هذه الخطوه، وردا على هذا الاحتجاج امر الوليد باسترجاع جميع الكنائس المصادره الاخرى في المدينه الى المسيحيين كتعويض. واكتمل بناء المسجد في عام 715 م، بعد وقت قصير من وفاه الوليد، وخلفه سليمان بن عبد الملك (715–717م) في الحكم.\nووفقا لمؤرخ القرن العاشر ابن الفقيه، اُنفق ما بين 600 الف و 1,000,000 دينار على المشروع، وقد اشتغل به حرفيون اقباط، فضلا عن عمال فارسيين وهنديين ويونانيين الذين يشكلون الجزء الاكبر من القوه العامله التي تتالف من 12 الف شخص. ويذكر ابن الفقيه ايضا ان العمال وجدوا مغاره تعود للكنيسه البيزنطيه اثناء بناء المسجد، وكانت هذه المغاره تحتوي على صندوق يوجد به راس القديس يوحنا المعمدان حسب المعتقد المسيحي، او النبي يحيى بن زكريا في الاسلام. فامر الوليد بتركه على حاله، وجعل عمودا قائما على المغاره كعلامه مميزه ثم وضع فوقه تابوت عليه اسم النبي يحيى.\n\nفي اعقاب الانتفاضه التي انهت حكم الامويين عام 750م على يد العباسيين، واصبحت الخلافه الاسلاميه تحت حكم السلاله العباسيه الذين قاموا نقل عاصمه الخلافه من دمشق الى بغداد. وبصرف النظر عن موقع دمشق الاستراتيجي والتجاري، لم يكن للعباسيون مصالح في دمشق. وبالتالي، فان المسجد الاموي قد عانى في بدايه حكمهم، مع القليل من نشاط البناء المسجل بين القرنين 8 و 10 . ومع ذلك، فان العباسيين نظروا للمسجد ليكون رمزا رئيسيا لانتصار الاسلام، وبالتالي نجا المسجد من منهجيه القضاء على تركه الامويين في مدينه دمشق. . وقام الفضل بن صالح بن علي الحاكم العباسي في دمشق، ببناء قبه في القسم الشرقي من المسجد في 780م. وبعد تسع سنوات، بدا بتشييد قبه الخزينه بغرض ادخار اموال المسجد  وجاء في مذكرات الجغرافي المقدسي، ان العباسيين قاموا ببناء المئذنه الشماليه («مئذنه العروس») من المسجد في عام 831 في عهد الخليفه المامون (813-833). وقد امر المامون بازاله واستبدال النقوش الامويه في المسجد.\nبحلول القرن 10م، رُكِّبت ساعه ضخمه عند المدخل في الجزء الغربي من الجدار الجنوبي للمسجد (باب زياده) ويبدو ان هذه الساعه قد توقفت عن عملها بحلول منتصف القرن 12م.\n\nاصبح الحكم العباسي على بلاد الشام متداعيا خلال القرن 10، وفي العقود التي تلت ذلك، اصبحت بلاد الشام خاضعه لحكم الامراء المحليين، وكانت تابعه للخلافه العباسيه اسميا فقط. وفي عام 970م، قام الفاطميون من مصر، بغزوا دمشق، واجرى الفاطميون بعض التحسينات المسجله للمسجد. وسمح لسكان دمشق بممارسه مذهبهم السني داخل الجامع الاموي في سكان، وتمكينهم من الحفاظ على الاستقلال النسبي من السلطه الدينيه الفاطميه الشيعيه. وفي 1069، دُمِّرت اجزاء كبيره من المسجد، خاصه الجدار الشمالي، في حريق نتيجه لانتفاضه سكان مدينه دمشق ضد الجيش الفاطمي بسبب الاعتداءات من طرف الثكنات الفاطميه في حق سكان دمشق.\n\nعصر السلاجقه والايوبيين\nفي سنه 1078م، استعاد سلاجقه الاتراك مدينه دمشق من ايدي الفاطميين، واصبحت دمشق تابعه للخلافه العباسيه اسميا فقط. وشرع الملك السلجوقي تتش بن الب ارسلان (حكم 1079-1095) لاصلاح الاضرار الناجمه عن الحريق الذي اصاب المسجد سنه 1069، وفي عام 1082م، قام ابو نصر احمد بن الفضل وزير تتش السلجوقي، باعاده تشييد القبه المركزيه في شكل اكثر اثاره؛ وقام ايضا بترميم اثنين من الارصفه دعم وتجديد الفسيفساء الامويه الاصليه من الواجهه الداخليه الشماليه للمسجد. واعيد بناء الرواق الشمالي في عام 1089م. وفي عام 1110م، قام ظاهر الدين طغتكين (حكم 1104-1128) وهو احد اتابكه السلاجقه في دمشق، باصلاح الجدار الشمالي وخُصص نقشان له ادرجا فوق مدخل. وفي عام 1113، اُغتيل شرف الدين مودود (حكم 1109-1113) احد اتابكه السلاجقه في الموصل في الجامع الاموي. وبما ان الصراع بين دمشق والصليبيين زاد في منتصف القرن 12م، كان المسجد الاموي بمثابه نقطه التجمع الرئيسيه لدعوه المسلمين للدفاع عن المدينه واستعاده القدس الى ايدي المسلمين. ويُعتبر ابن عساكر احد الائمه البارزين الذي بشروا بالجهاد، وعندما تقدم الصليبيون نحو دمشق سنه 1148، استجاب سكان المدينه لدعوات المطالبه بالجهاد؛ وعلى اثر هذا انسحب الجيش الصليبي نتيجه المقاومه البطوليه لسكان دمشق.\n\nوفي عام 1154 م، خلال عهد نور الدين زنكي، بنيت ساعه اثريه ثانيه، وساعه جيرون المائيه، باوامر شخصيه من نور الدين. وشيدت الساعه من خارج المدخل الشرقي للمسجد (باب جيرون) من قبل واعاد بناؤها المعماري محمد الساعاتي، بعد حريق اصاب المسجد في عام 1167، كما رُمِّمت في نهايه المطاف على يد ابنه، رضوان، في اوائل القرن 13. وقد نجت من حريق في القرن 14. وقد زار الجغرافي العربي الادريسي المسجد الاموي عام 1154.\nوفي العهد الايوبي شهدت دمشق انشاء العديد من المؤسسات الدينيه، واُبقي على الجامع الاموي في مكانه كمركز للحياه الدينيه في المدينه. ووصف الرحاله الاندلسي ابن جبير اهميه المسجد كمركز شامل للعلوم الدينيه، نظرا لاحتوائه العديد من الزوايا المختلفه للدراسات الدينيه والقرانيه. وفي عام 1173، تعرض الجدار الشمالي للمسجد مره اخرى لاضرار بسبب اندلاع حريق، واعيد بناؤه من قبل السلطان الايوبي صلاح الدين (حكم 1174-1193)، جنبا الى جنب مع مئذنه العروس، التي كانت قد دمرت في الحريق الذي وقع سنه 1069م، وخلال النزاعات الداخليه بين الامراء الايوبيين لاحقًا، تعرضت مدينه دمشق بسب هذه النزاعات لاضرار كبيره، وفي عام 1245م، دُمِّرت المئذنه الشرقيه للمسجد المعروفه بمئذنه عيسى على يد الصالح ايوب سابع خلافاء بني ايوب بمصر، في اثناء محاصرته لدمشق في عهد الصالح اسماعيل الامير الايوبي لدمشق. وقد اعيد بناء المئذنه لاحقًا مع اضافه زخرفه قليله لها.\nدُفن صلاح الدين الايوبي مع العديد من خلفائه، حول المسجد الاموي.\n\nدوله المماليك\nوفي عام 1260م. تحالف المغول، بقياده كتبغا مع القوات الصليبيه، واستولوا على دمشق من الايوبيين، وقد امر بوهيموند السادس امير اماره انطاكيه، باقامه القداس الكاثوليكي في «المسجد الاموي». ومع ذلك، استطاع المماليك بقياده قطز وبيبرس، استرجاع مدينه دمشق لاحقًا في نفس العام. وفي عام 1270، امر بيبرس بترميمات واسعه النطاق للمسجد، لا سيما الرخام والفسيفساء والايرمينيه. ووفقا لكاتب سيره بيبرس، ابن شداد، ان تكلفه ترميمات التي اقيمت في عهد بيبرس بلغت 20,000 ديناراً. وكان من بين اكبر الشظايا التي اضيفت للمسجد هي قطعه فسيفساء يبلغ طولها 34.5 متر وعرضها 7.3 متر، وقد اقيمت هذه الفسيفساء في الرواق الغربي وتسمى لوحه بردى. وكانت هذه القطعه من الفسيفساء التي زينت المسجد جزء من مشروع الترميم الذي شمل المسجد، وكان لها تاثير كبير في عماره المماليك في مصر والشام.\nفي عام 1285م، بدا العالم ابن تيميه بتدريس تفسير القران في المسجد. وفي عام 1300م، قام الخانيه المغول بقياده محمود غازان بغزو مدينه دمشق، فقام ابن تيميه بحثّ مواطني دمشق على الجهاد ومقاومه الاحتلال. واستطاع المماليك بقياده قلاوون بطرد المغول لاحقًا من تلك السنه. وعندما دخلت قوات قلاوون الى المدينه، حاول المغول اقامه عده مجانيق في «المسجد الاموي» لكن محاولتهم باءت بالفشل. وشرع المماليك بحرق المجانيق قبل ان توضع في المسجد.\nوفي الاعوام الممتده مابين 1326-1328م، قام الوالي المملوكي في الشام، تانكيز، باعمال ترميم في المسجد، وامر باعاده تجميع لوحات الفسيفساء على جدار القبله واستبدال كل البلاط في قاعه الصلاه بالرخام. كما قام السلطان المملوكي الناصر محمد بن قلاوون باعمال ترميم رئيسيه للمسجد في عام 1328. وقد هدمت قبله الجدار غير المستقره واُعيد بناؤها ونُقلت بوابه باب زياده الى الجهه الشرقيه من المسجد. وقد تضرر جزء كبير من هذه الاعمال خلال الحريق الذي احرق المسجد في عام 1339. وقد وصف خبير الفن الاسلامي، فينبار ب.فلوود. دور المماليك البحريه في اعاده ترميم المسجد الاموي بالهوس، وجهودهم في صيانه واصلاح واستعاده المسجد كانت لا مثيل لها في اي فتره اخرى من حكم الاسلامي لدمشق. وقد قضى عالم الفلك العربي ابن الشاطر معظم حياته في وظيفه التوقيت ورئاسه المؤذنين في الجامع الاموي من عام 1332 حتى وفاته في عام 1376. وقد قيل انه قام بتنصيب مزوله كبيره على المئذنه الشماليه للمسجد في عام 1371. وفي عام 1392م احترقت مئذنه عيسى خلال حريق اصاب المسجد عام 1392م .\nوفي عام 1400، غزا تيمور دمشق. واصدر اوامره باحراق المدينه يوم 17 اذار/مارس، وقد دمر الحريق اجزاء كبيره من المسجد الاموي. وانهارت المئذنه الشرقيه والقبه المركزيه. ورُمِّمت لاحقًا، واضيفت مئذنه في جهه الجنوب الغربي من المسجد خلال عهد السلطان المملوكي قايتباي في عام 1488م.\n\nالدوله العثمانيه\nفي عام 1516م، سيطر العثمانيون على دمشق بقياده سليم الاول بعد انتصارهم على المماليك في معركه مرج دابق. وحضر سليم الاول لتاديه صلاه الجمعه في الجامع الاموي . واستخدم العثمانيون نظام الوقف للمواقع الدينيه كوسيله لربط السكان المحليين مع السلطه المركزيه. وكان وقف الجامع الاموي هو الاكبر في المدينه، ووظِّف 596 شخص. وخُصصت اغلب الوظائف الاشرافيه والكتابيه للمسؤولين العثمانيين في حين خُصصت المكاتب الدينيه في الغالب للعلماء المحليين. على الرغم من ان الاوقاف تخضع للضريبه، فقداُعفي الجامع الاموي منها. وفي عام 1518، قام جانبيردي الغزالي الوالي العثماني لدمشق والمشرف العام لوقف المسجد، بعمليات اصلاح وتزيين المسجد كجزء من برنامجه باعاده اعمار مدينه دمشق.\nوفي عام 1661م عُيِّن الباحث الصوفي البارز عبد الغني النابلسي للتدريس في المسجد الاموي.\n\nوفي عام 1893م شب حريق ادى الى تدمير معظم الفسيفساء والالواح الرخاميه، ولكن اُعيدا في وقت لاحق. وقد دمر الحريق ايضا النسيج الداخلي لقاعه الصلاه وتسبب في انهيار القبه الوسطى للمسجد. والسبب الرئيسي لهذا الحريق هو احد العمال الذين كانوا يقومون باعمال ترميم للمسجد، وقد كان هذا العامل يقوم بطريق الخطا بتدخين النارجيله. وقد قام العثمانيون باعاده تشييد كامل المسجد، ولكن اُحتفظ بالهيكل الاصيل احتفاظاً كبيراً.\nوفي عام 1899م، اعطيت معظم محتويات قبه الخزنه الى الامبراطور الالماني فيلهلم الثاني واُحتفظ بعدد قليل من القطع في الارشيف الوطني في دمشق\"\n\nسوريا الحديثه\nالانتداب الفرنسي\nفي عام 1929، كان اهالي دمشق يجتمعون في الجامع الاموي كل جمعه، ليقوموا بمظاهرات مندده ضد سلطات الانتداب الفرنسي، ولم يقتحم الفرنسيون الجامع طيله وجودهم في سوريا لمعرفتهم بمكانه الجامع الاموي عند اهل الشام.\nوقد خضع المسجد الاموي لترميمات كبرى خلال الانتداب الفرنسي على سوريا، واستمرت حتى عام 1963 في ظل الجمهوريه السوريه الاولى.\n\nما بعد الاستعمار\nفي الثمانينات وفي اوائل التسعينات، امر الرئيس السوري حافظ الاسد بعمليه تجديد واسعه النطاق للمسجد. وشملت الترميمات المئذنه الغربيه للمسجد (مئذنه قيتابي) والواجه الغربيه للجامع، والجدار الشمالي للجامع المطل على ضريح صلاح الدين، كما اعيد تبليط المدخل الغربي للجامع، وتجديد الارضيات وتبديل القواعد الحجريه التالفه للاعمده، ومعالجه الخشبيات التالفه وترميم واصلاح الصالات واعاده انشاء وتركيب قبه داخل صحن الجامع، اضافهً لانشاء شبكه اطفاء خاصه بالمسجد.\nوقد انتهت اعمال الترميم والاصلاح في سنه 1414هـ / 1994م، واعيد افتتاح المسجد.\nوفي عام 2001، زار البابا يوحنا بولس الثاني المسجد، لرؤيه اثار مقام يوحنا المعمدان. وكانت هذه هي المره الاولى التي يقوم فيها البابا بزياره الى مسجد.\nوفي 15 مارس 2011، بدات اول الاحتجاجات التي تتعلق بالحرب الاهليه السوريه في المسجد الاموي عندما اجتمع مابين 40-50 مصلٍّ، حيث قام المتظاهرون برفع شعارات تطالب بالديمقراطيه. لكن قوات الامن السوريه قامت بقمع الاحتجاجات بسرعه، وطُوِّق المسجد خلال صلاه الجمعه لمنع ظهور مظاهرات الواسعه النطاق.\n\nالعماره\nالفناء وحرم الجامع\nارضيه المسجد الاموي هي مستطيله الشكل وهي بقياس 97 متر عرض و 156 متر طول. ويحتل الفناء الجزء الاكبر من المسجد وهو يغطي الجزء الخارجي الشمالي من المسجد، في حين يغطي حرم الجامع الجزء الجنوبي من المسجد. ويحيط فناء المسجد اربعه جدران خارجيه. اما الارصفه الحجريه للفناء فقد اصبحت متفاوته بمرور الزمن بسبب الاصلاحات التي مر بها المسجد على مدار التاريخ، وقد سُويَّت مؤخرًا. اما الاروقه المحيطه بالفناء فقد دُعِمت باعمده حجريه وارصفه بشكل متناوب. ويوجد رصيف واحد بين كل عمودين. نظراً لان الجزء الشمالي من الفناء قد دمر في زلزال وقع في عام 1759، كما ان الممرات ليست متسقه؛ ويرجع ذلك لعدم وجود الاعمده التي كانت تدعم ذلك، عندما اعيد بناء الجدار الشمالي. كما يوجد ايضاً داخل صحن الجامع عمودان ذوو راس نحاسي مزخرف كانا يستعملان للاضاءه.\nوتتكون المساحه الداخليه من الحرم من ثلاثه اروقه. وهي موازيه لاتجاه الصلاه نحو مكه المكرمه. ودُعِمت الاروقه بصفين من الاعمده الكورنثيه. وكل واحد من هذه الاروقه ينقسم الى مستويين. ويتالف المستوى الاول من اقواس نصف دائريه كبيره، في حين ان المستوى الثاني يتكون من اقواس مزدوجه. ويتكرر هذا النمط في اروقه الفناء. اما الاروقه الداخليه الثلاثه تتقاطع في وسط الحرم مع رواق كبير، يوازي جدار القبله («اتجاه الصلاه») ويواجه المحراب والمنبر. وينقسم الجناح المركزي في الاروقه الى نصفين ويتكون من احد عشر قوسًا. والحرم الشريف هو بقياس 136 متر طول و37 متر عرض.\nكما يوجد داخل فناء الجامع ثلاث منشئات صغيره وهي:\n\nقبه الخزنه\n\nانشئت قبه الخزنه بدايه في العهد العباسي في عام 789م، واستخدمت كخزنه لاموال الجامع، ومن ثم اصبحت مكتبه لكتب ومخطوطات الجامع النفيسه.\n\nقبه الوضوء\nانشئت قبه الوضوء بدايه في العهد العباسي، وانهارت بعد وقوع زلزال في عام 1759م، وقد جددت في العهد العثماني بامر من والي دمشق عثمان باشا الكرجي، وتقع في وسط الفناء وهي مجوفه مثمنه من رخام قائمه على اربعه اعمده رخاميه في وسطها انبوب ماء من النحاس يمج الماء الى الاعلى.\n\nقبه الساعات\nتقع في الجهه الشرقيه من فناء الجامع الاموي، ويعود تاريخها الى العهد العثماني، اما عن تسميتها بقبه الساعات، فيعود الى العصر العثماني الذي نقل اليها الساعات الموجوده على باب الجامع، وجعل منها مركز التوقيت.\n\nالمحاريب\nيوجد اربعه محاريب على خط جدار الحرم، واهمها محراب الصحابه الكبير الذي يقع تقريبًا في وسط الجدار. ويقع محراب صحابه النبي في النصف الشرقي. ووفقا للمهندس العباسي موسى بن شاكر، بُني المحراب الاخير خلال مرحله التشييد الاولى للمسجد، واصبح المحراب ثالث محراب متخصص في تاريخ الاسلام. وهو اقدم محراب في المسجد، حيث كان يصلي المسلمين قبل انشاء المسجد، ويسمى ايضاً محراب المالكيه. اما المحاريب الباقيه فهي:\n\nمحراب الخطيب\nمحراب الحنفيه\nمحراب الحنابله\n\nواجهه الحرم\nزُيين الفناء والحرم الشريف للجامع الاموي بواجهه فخمه تزيد المسجد فخامه ووقاراً معروفه بواجهه الحرم، وتقع في الجهه الجنوبيه من المسجد، وتطل على الفناء والذي يضم 25 باباً خشبياً تنفتح مباشره على الحرم.\nويعتقد المؤرخون ان واجهه الحرم كانت مماثله للاسلوب والنمط المعماري لبقيه الاروقه من حيث تناوب العضائد والاعمده، واعيد بناء الواجهه من غير اعمده بعد حريق وقع عام 1067، وحلَّ محل هذه الاعمده عضائد يرتفع في منتصفها كتله فخمه مازالت على وضعها الاموي الاصلي، وتتالف هذه الكتله من ثلاثه ابواب بقناطر نصف دائريه ترتكز على عضادتين يتوسطهما عمودان، وفوق هذه الابواب الثلاثه قوس كبير يحتوي ثلاثه نوافذ.\nوقد وُضِع على جانبي هذه الكتله برجان صغيران تعلوهما قبتان صغيرتان من الرصاص فوقهما ثلاث تفاحات وهلال من النحاس.\nوفي عهد الوليد كانت هذه الواجهه بما فيها مكسوّه بـالفسيفساء، سقط معظمها اثر الحرائق والزلازل التي اصابت المسجد على مدار التاريخ، وبقيت على حالها حتى الستينات من القرن الماضي حيث تمت عمليه ترميم واستصناع الفسيفساء باشراف وزاره الاوقاف والمديريه العامه للمتاحف، وكُسيت هذه الواجهه برسوم فسيفسائيه مستوحاه من الاسلوب الاموي الاصيل.\n\nقبه النسر\nهي احدى انجازات الوليد بن عبد الملك واكبر قبه في المسجد الاموي، وقد جددت هذه القبه في عهد نظام الملك وزير ملك شاه السلجوقي في عام 1075، وقام صلاح الدين الايوبي بتجديد ركنين منها في عام 1179، واستبدلت القبه الخشبيه الاصليه وبنائها من الحجر في اعقاب الحريق الذي وقع عام 1893.\nوتقع القبه فوق مركز قاعه الصلاه، بارتفاع 45 متر وقطرها 16 مترًا، وترتكز القبه على طبقه تحتيه مثمنه مع اثنين من النوافذ المقوسه على جانبيها، ودُعِمت باعمده الممرات الداخليه المركزيه.\nووصفها ابن جبير قائلا فيها:\n\nاما عن تسميتها بقبه النسر فيقول ابن جبير في كتابه احسن التقاسيم في معرفه الاقاليم:\n\nالماذن والمشاهد\nالماذن\nيحتوي المسجد الاموي على ثلاث ماذن وهي مئذنه العروس و مئذنه النبي عيسى ومئذنه قايتباي.\n\nمئذنه العروس\nتعتبر مئذنه العروس اقدم مئذنه شيدت في المسجد، وتقع في الجدار الشمالي للمسجد. لكن تاريخ تشييدها الدقيق غير معروف. اما الجزء السفلي من المئذنه يعود الى الحقبه العباسيه في القرن التاسع حسب المراجع التي وصلتنا. وقد يكون العباسيون قد بنوها فوق المئذنه الامويه القديمه، ولكن لا يوجد دليل قطعي يؤكد ان مئذنه الجدار الشمالي (مئذنه العروس) كانت جزءًا من المسجد الاصلي الذي بناه الخليفه الوليد. وقد ذكر شمس الدين المقدسي في مذكراته ان المئذنه قد شيدت في اواخر القرن العاشر الميلادي، اثناء زيارته لموقع المئذنه خلال الحكم العباسي لدمشق في عام 985م حيث وصفها انها شيدت مؤخرًا، اما الجزء العلوي من المئذنه شُيِّدَ في عام 1174. ويستخدم هذه المئذنه المؤذن للدعوه للصلاه، ويوجد درج لولبي يتكون من 160 درجه يؤدي بدوره الى غرفه المؤذن.\n\nوتنقسم مئذنه العروس الى قسمين؛ البرج الرئيسي متصل بمئذنه صغيره ثانيه من خلال ممر مسقوف ينتهي بشرفه خشبيه مضلعه يعلوها قبه صنوبريه بتفاحات وهلال دائري. تعود الى العصر المملوكي. ويعتبر البرج الرئيسي اقدم جزء من المئذنه، وهو مربع الشكل، له اربعه معارض، ويتالف من شكلين مختلفين من البناء؛ حيث تتكون القاعده من كتل كبيره، في حين بُني الجزء العلوي من الحجر. كما يوجد اثنين من فتحات الضوء بالقرب من اعلى البرج الرئيسي قبل السطح، مع اقواس على شكل حدوه الحصان مقوسنه تحت قوس واحد. وفي القرن 18 عُلِّقت مزوله اصليه تعود للقرن 14 التي بناها ابن الشاطر.\n\nمئذنه عيسى\nتقع مئذنه عيسى في الزاويه الجنوبيه الشرقيه للمسجد الاموي، ويبلغ ارتفاعها حوالي 77 متر، كما تعتبر اطول الماذن الثلاث. وتذكر بعض المصادر ان المئذنه بنيت من طرف العباسيين في القرن التاسع، بينما تعزو مصادر اخرى ان الهيكل الاصلي يعود للعهد الاموي، وقد ظلت مئدنه عيسى احدى اطول 5 بنايات بشريه لاكثر من 400 عام، ما بين القرن 8 والقرن 12 م. وتنقسم المئذنه الى قسمين متنافرين، حيث ان القسم السفلي بُنِى في العهد الايوبي في عام 1247، بينما شيد القسم العلوي في العهد العثماني. الجزء السفلي للمئذنه هو على مربع الشكل وتحتوي على نوافذ عثمانيه مقوسنه، شبيهه بنوافذ مئذنه العروس، اما الجزء العلوي فياتي مباشره وبانتقال غير متناسب هندسياً الى جذع مثمن الاضلاع عثماني الطراز، يتضمن شرفتين للمؤذن بمقرنصات خفيفه بدون مظلات ساتره، ويعلو المئذنه قلنسوه مخروطيه الشكل يعلوها ثلاث تفاحات وهلال كامل الاستداره.\nاما عن سبب تسميتها بمئذنه عيسى، فهي بسبب الاعتقاد الشعبي السائد بان النبي عيسى سينزل في اخر الزمان في هذا الموقع لمحاربه الدجال. ويدعم ابن كثير هذه الفكره، وهو احد العلماء المسلمين البارزين في القرن الرابع عشر.\n\nمئذنه قايتباي\nبنيت مئذنه قايتباي المعروفه ايضا بالمئذنه الغربيه، في عهد السلطان المملوكي قايتباي في عام 1488. وهي احد اهم المعالم الاسلاميه المصريه النموذجيه في دمشق، في الفتره المملوكيه، وتعتبر اول مئذنه شيدت في دمشق على هذا الطراز، والمئذنه هي مثمنه الشكل وتنقسم الى ثلاثه اجزاء. ويوجد اعتقاد ان مئذنه عيسى ومئذنه قايتباي بنيا فوق ابراج رومانيه قديمه، لكن بعض العلماء شككوا في صحه هذا الاعتقاد. في اكتوبر 2025، بعد مرور ما يقارب العام على سقوط نظام الاسد، اُزيل اسم حافظ الاسد الذي كان منقوشاً على مئذنه قايتباي عقب اعمال ترميم سابقه.\n\nالمشاهد\nالمشاهد هي عباره عن صالات واسعه ضمن المسجد الاموي، وقد اختلفت وظيفتها باختلاف الزمن، ويحتوي الجامع الاموي بدمشق على اربعه مشاهد تقع على يمين ويسار البابين الشرقي والغربي، وسُميت بدايهً باسماء الخلفاء الراشدين الاربعه وهي تتوزع كالتالي:\n\nمشهد ابي بكر\nيقع مشهد ابي بكر الصديق في الجهه الجنوبيه الشرقيه من المسجد الاموي ويستعمل الان كمتحف للجامع.\n\nمشهد عمر\nيقع مشهد عمر بن الخطاب في الجهه الجنوبيه الغربيه من المسجد الاموي ويستعمل الان كمقر لاداره المسجد.\n\nمشهد عثمان\nيقع مشهد الخليفه عثمان بن عفان في الجهه الشماليه الغربيه من المسجد ويستعمل الان كقاعه شرف لاستقبال كبار الضيوف.\n\nمشهد علي والحسين\nيقع مشهد الخليفه علي بن ابي طالب في الزاويه الشماليه الشرقيه من المسجد الاموي، ويحتوي على مزار ومقام راس الامام الحسين بن علي، وقد غلبت عليه تسميه مشهد الحسين.\n\nبئر الجامع\nيقع بئر الجامع في الحرم الشريف، ويقابل محراب الصحابه، ويعتبر البئر من اقدم منشات الجامع، وقد انشا في حرم الجامع قبل توسعه الوليد، وقد شُيِّد بهدف تزويد المصلين بماء الوضوء والشرب. وقد حافظ الوليد على هذا البئر واضاف اليه عمودين نفيسين مع توابعهما قدر ثمنهم بالف وخمس مئه دينار ذهبي، دفعها الوليد لخالد بن يزيد اثناء التجهيزات التي اجريت على البئر .\n\nابواب الجامع\nيحتوي المسجد الاموي على اربعه ابواب رئيسيه وهي:\n\nباب جيرون\nهو احد ابواب الجامع الاموي الاربعه، ويقع على الحائط الشرقي للجامع ويقابل حي النوفره، وهو مؤلف من ثلاث فتحات، حيث يوجد في الوسط باب كبير والى جانبيه بابان صغيران، اما عن تسميته بـ باب جيرون فتوجد عده نظريات تشرح ذلك، فالمؤرخون العرب ينسبوه الى جيرون بن سعد بن عاد، ويعتقد انه هو الذي بنى مدينه جيرون التي سميت لاحقا بدمشق، ويوجد تحليل اخر للاسم وهو لغوي مشتق من الجذر جار، وهو للدلاله على الاحياء المجاوره، ويطلق على هذا الباب الان اسم باب النوفره نسبهً لـ حي النوفره المقابل له.\n\nباب العماره/باب الكلاسه\nهو احد ابواب الجامع الاموي الاربعه، ويقع على الحائط الشمالي للجامع تحت مئذنه العروس من ناحيه العماره، وهو مؤلف من بوابه واحده تطل على صحن فناء الجامع الاموي، وقد سُمي بعده اسماء نذكر منها باب الفراديس، وباب الناطفانيين لكونه كان يطل على الحي المشهور بصناعه الناطف، ويسمى ايضا باب الكلاسه نسبه الى حي الكلاسه المقابل له، ويعرف ايضاً بباب العماره نسبهً لحي العماره القريب منه.\n\nباب بريد\nهو احد ابواب الجامع الاموي الاربعه، ويقع على الحائط الغربي للجامع مقابل ساحه المسكيه، وهو مؤلف من ثلاث فتحات، حيث يوجد في الوسط باب كبير والى جانبيه بابان صغيران، كما ان باب بريد يقابل باب جيرون، ويشرح المؤرخون العرب هذه التسميه بان بريد هو شقيق جيرون، وهو ابن عاد بن عوص بن ارم بن سام بن نوح وقد سميت البوابتان الرئيستان باسمهما، ويطلق على هذا الباب ايضا اسم باب المسكيه نسبهً لسوق المسكيه المقابل له.\n\nباب الزياده\nهو احد ابواب الجامع الاموي الاربعه، ويقع في الجهه الغربيه من الحائط الجنوبي مقابل سوق الصاغه، وهو الباب الوحيد المؤدي مباشره لحرم المسجد، وقد سُمي بهذا الاسم لكونه اُحدث زيادهً في سور المعبد عند بناء الجامع في عهد الوليد، ويعرف ايضاً باسم باب الساعات في نهايه الالفيه الاولى حيث وصفه ابن عساكر بقوله:\n\nوقد زود الجامع الاموي في كل العهود بساعه شمسيه، وساعه فلكيه، وساعات اخرى، اختلفت اشكالها واحجامها باختلاف العصور، وقد اشتهرت منها ساعه وصفها بدقه الرحاله ابن جبير قائلاً:\n\nوفي عام 1200، انتقلت هذه الساعات الى باب جيرون، وانتقلت هذه التسميه ايضاً الى باب جيرون.\nويعرف باب الزياده الان باسم باب الصاغه نسبهً لسوق الصاغه المقابل له. ويسمى ايضا بـ باب القوافين نسبه الى سوق القوافين القديم وحي القوافين الذي كان موجوداً هناك انذاك.\n\nالتاثيرات الهندسيه على المسجد\nالمسجد الاموي هو احد المساجد القليله في العالم الاسلامي التي حافظت على نفس الهيكل العام والمعالم المعماريه، منذ بنائه الاول في اوائل القرن الثامن، وطابعه الاموي لم يتغير الى حد كبير. ومنذ انشائه استعمل المسجد لتاديه صلاه الجماعه في سوريا، ووفقًا للمؤرخ فينبار باري فلوود، فان «بناء مسجد دمشق لم يغير المشهد الحضري لمدينه دمشق فقط، بل اكد اثر هيمنه العماره الامويه في العالم الاسلامي، واضاف المسجد الاموي في دمشق بعدا اخر في عماره المساجد في سوريا والعالم الاسلامي بشكل عام». ومن امثله المساجد التي تاثرت بالمسجد الاموي كنموذج اولي هي:\n\nالجامع الازهر\nمسجد بيبرس في القاهره\nالمسجد الكبير في قرطبه في اسبانيا\nالمسجد الكبير في مدينه بورصه\nجامع السليميه في تركيا.\n\nخطباء الجامع الاموي\nاعتلى سده منبر الجامع وامامه المصلين فيه، عدد من اشهر علماء بلاد الشام عبر التاريخ، منهم:\n\nعلماء عائله الخطيب الحسني\nالشيخ عبد القادر

      "summary": "جامع بني أمية الكبير، ويعرف اختصارًا بالجامع الأموي، هو المسجد الذي أمر الوليد بن عبد الملك بتشييده في دمشق، وهو من أشهر المساجد وأفخمها، وأحد عجائب الإسلام السبعة في العالم.\nبدأ بناء الجامع الأموي في عام 705م على يد الوليد بن عبد الملك، وقد حشد له صنّاعاً من الفرس والهنود، وأوفد إمبراطور بيزنطة مئة فنان يوناني للمشاركة في التزيين، ونال قسطًا وافرًا من المدح والوصف، لا سيَّما من الرحالة والمؤرخين والأدباء الذين مرّوا بدمشق عبر العصور وأطروا بشكل خاص على زينة سقف المسجد وجدرانه الفسيفسائية الملونة، والرخام المستعمل في البناء. إلا أن أغلبها طُمس بناءً على فتاوى بعدم جوزاها حتى أُعيد اكتشافها وترميمها عام 1928. وقد وصفها المؤرخ فيليب حتي بأنها «تمثل الصناعة الأهلية السورية وليس الفن اليوناني أو البيزنطي.»\nيتميز الجامع الأموي أيضًا بكونه أول مسجد ظهر فيه المحراب والحنية نتيجة طراز البناء الذي كان يشكل كنيسة يوحنا المعمدان سابقاً. أما مئذنته الشمالية، وهي أقدم مآذنه الثلاث، فتعود لعهد الوليد بن عبد الملك. كما استخدمت أيضاً منارةً لمدينة دمشق، وكانت ستعمل خلال القرون الوسطى للمنقطين للتأمل والصلاة، ومنها انتشر نموذج المئذنة المربعة إلى سائر أنحاء سوريا وشمال إفريقيا والأندلس.\nيحتوي الجامع على مدفن جسد يوحنا المعمدان -النبي يحيى- نسيب المسيح، ولم يبقَ من آثاره المسيحية سوى جرن العماد ونقش باليونانية في مدح المسيح على أحد الجدران. كما يحوي المسجد أيضاً على الفتحة التي وضع فيها رأس الحسين بن علي حين حُمل إلى دمشق. وأُلحق بالمسجد مقبرة تضم رفات صلاح الدين الأيوبي.\nاحترقت أجزاء من الجامع ثلاث مرات: الأولى عام 1069م، والثانية على يد تيمورلنك عام 1400م، والثالثة عام 1893م. وكانت آخر عمليات الترميم في العصر الحديث عام 1994م.",
