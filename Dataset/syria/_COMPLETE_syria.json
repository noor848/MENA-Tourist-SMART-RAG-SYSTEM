          "content": "Damascus is the capital and largest city of Syria. It is the oldest capital city in the world. Known colloquially in Syria as aš-Šām and dubbed, poetically, the \"City of Jasmine\" (مَدِيْنَةُ الْيَاسْمِينِ Madīnat al-Yāsmīn), Damascus is a major cultural center of the Levant and the Arab world.\nSituated in southwestern Syria, Damascus is the center of a large metropolitan area. Nestled among the eastern foothills of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean on a plateau 680 metres (2,230 ft) above sea level, Damascus experiences an arid climate because of the rain shadow effect. The Barada River flows through Damascus.\nDamascus is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. First settled in the 3rd millennium BC, it was chosen as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate from 661 to 750. After the victory of the Abbasid dynasty, the seat of Islamic power was moved to Baghdad. According to some, Damascus is the fourth holiest city in Islam. The city saw its importance decline throughout the Abbasid era, only to regain significant importance in the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods.\nToday, it is the seat of the central government of Syria. Damascus was named the least livable city out of 140 global cities in the Global Liveability Ranking. As of June 2023, it was the least livable out of 173 global cities in the same Global Liveability Ranking. In 2017, two new development projects were launched in Damascus to build new residential districts, Marota City and Basillia City to symbolize post-war reconstruction.\n\nNames and etymology\nThe name of Damascus first appeared in the geographical list of Thutmose III as ṯmśq (𓍘𓄟𓊃𓈎𓅱) in the 15th century BC.\nThe etymology of the ancient name ṯmśq is uncertain. It is attested as Imerišú (𒀲𒋙) in Akkadian, Damašq (𐡃𐡌𐡔𐡒‎) in Old Aramaic and Dammeśeq (דַּמֶּשֶׂק) in Biblical Hebrew. A number of Akkadian spellings are found in the Amarna letters, from the 14th century BC: Dimašqa (𒁲𒈦𒋡), Dimašqì (𒁲𒈦𒀸𒄀), and Dimašqa (𒁲𒈦𒀸𒋡).\nLater Aramaic spellings of the name often include an intrusive resh (letter r), perhaps influenced by the root dr, meaning \"dwelling\". Thus, the English and Latin name of the city is Damascus, which was imported from Greek Δαμασκός and originated from the Qumranic Darmeśeq (דרמשק), and Darmsûq (ܕܪܡܣܘܩ) in Syriac, meaning \"a well-watered land\".\nAccording to ancient Greek tradition, there were three myths about the origin of the city's name (Δαμασκός). One claims it was named after the giant Ascus (Ἄσκος). Another says it was named after Damaskos, the son of Hermes and the nymph Alimede, who traveled from Arcadia to Syria and founded a city bearing his name. A third version holds that Damaskos was a man who, after Dionysus made Syria fertile with vineyards, cut them down with an axe. Enraged, Dionysus pursued and flayed him. His original name was Darmaskos, which later evolved into Damaskos.\nIn Arabic, the city is called Dimashq (دمشق Dimašq). The city is also known as aš-Šām by the citizens of Damascus, of Syria and other Arab neighbors and Turkey (Şam). Aš-Šām is an Arabic term for \"Levant\" and for \"Syria\"; the latter, and particularly the historical region of Syria, is called Bilād aš-Šām (بلاد الشام, lit. 'land of the Levant'). The latter term etymologically means \"land of the left-hand side\" or \"the north\", as someone in the Hijaz facing east, oriented to the sunrise, will find the north to the left. This is contrasted with the name of Yemen (اَلْيَمَن al-Yaman), correspondingly meaning \"the right-hand side\" or \"the south\". The variation ش ء م (š-ʾ-m'), of the more typical ش م ل (š-m-l), is also attested in Old South Arabian, 𐩦𐩱𐩣 (šʾm), with the same semantic development.\n\nGeography\nDamascus was built in a strategic site on a plateau 680 m (2,230 ft) above sea level and about 80 km (50 mi) inland from the Mediterranean, sheltered by the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, supplied with water by the Barada River, and at a crossroads between trade routes: the north–south route connecting Egypt with Asia Minor, and the east–west cross-desert route connecting Lebanon with the Euphrates river valley. The Anti-Lebanon Mountains mark the border between Syria and Lebanon. The range has peaks of over 10,000 ft (3,000 m) and blocks precipitation from the Mediterranean Sea, so the region of Damascus is sometimes subject to droughts. However, in ancient times, the Barada River mitigated this, which originates from mountain streams fed by melting snow. Damascus is surrounded by the Ghouta, irrigated farmland where many vegetables, cereals, and fruits have been farmed since ancient times. Maps of Roman Syria indicate that the Barada River emptied into a lake of some size east of Damascus. Today it is called Bahira Atayba, the hesitant lake because in years of severe drought, it does not even exist.\nThe modern city has an area of 105 km2 (41 sq mi), out of which 77 km2 (30 sq mi) is urban, while Jabal Qasioun occupies the rest.\n\nThe old city of Damascus, enclosed by the city walls, lies on the south bank of the river Barada which is almost dry (3 cm (1 in) left). To the southeast, north, and northeast it is surrounded by suburban areas whose history stretches back to the Middle Ages: Midan in the southwest, Sarouja and Imara in the north and north-west. These neighborhoods originally arose on roads leading out of the city, near the tombs of religious figures. In the 19th century outlying villages developed on the slopes of Jabal Qasioun, overlooking the city, already the site of the al-Salihiyah neighborhood centered on the important shrine of medieval Andalusian Sheikh and philosopher Ibn Arabi. These new neighborhoods were initially settled by Kurdish soldiery and Muslim refugees from the Europe regions of the Ottoman Empire which had fallen under Christian rule. Thus they were known as al-Akrad (the Kurds) and al-Muhajirin (the migrants). They lay 2–3 km (1–2 mi) north of the old city.\nFrom the late 19th century on, a modern administrative and commercial center began to spring up to the west of the old city, around the Barada, centered on the area known as al-Marjeh or \"the meadow\". Al-Marjeh soon became the name of what was initially the central square of modern Damascus, with the city hall in it. The courts of justice, post office, and railway station stood on higher ground slightly to the south. A Europeanized residential quarter soon began to be built on the road leading between al-Marjeh and al-Salihiyah. The commercial and administrative center of the new city gradually shifted northwards slightly towards this area.\n\nIn the 20th century, newer suburbs developed north of the Barada, and to some extent to the south, invading the Ghouta oasis. In 1956–1957, the new neighborhood of Yarmouk became a second home to many Palestinian refugees. City planners preferred to preserve the Ghouta as far as possible, and in the later 20th century some of the main areas of development were to the north, in the western Mezzeh neighborhood and most recently along the Barada valley in Dummar in the northwest and on the slopes of the mountains at Barzeh in the north-east. Poorer areas, often built without official approval, have mostly developed south of the main city.\nDamascus used to be surrounded by an oasis, the Ghouta region (Arabic: الغوطة, romanized: al-ġūṭä), watered by the Barada river. The Fijeh spring, west along the Barada valley, used to provide the city with drinking water, and various sources to the west are tapped by water contractors. The flow of the Barada dropped with the rapid expansion of housing and industry in the city and it is almost dry. The lower aquifers are polluted by the city's runoff from heavily used roads, industry, and sewage.\n\nClimate\nDamascus has a cool arid climate (BWk) in the Köppen-Geiger system, due to the rain shadow effect of the Anti-Lebanon Mountains and the prevailing ocean currents. Summers are prolonged, dry, and hot with less humidity. Winters are cool and somewhat rainy; snowfall is infrequent. Autumn is brief and mild, but has the most drastic temperature change, unlike spring where the transition to summer is more gradual and steady. Annual rainfall is around 130 mm (5 in), occurring from October to May.\n\nHistory\nEarly settlement\nCarbon-14 dating at Tell Ramad, on Damascus's outskirts, suggests that the site may have been occupied since the second half of the seventh millennium BC, possibly around 6300 BC. But evidence of settlement in the wider Barada basin dating to 9000 BC exists, although no large-scale settlement was present within Damascus's walls until the second millennium BC.\n\nLate Bronze\nSome of the earliest Egyptian records are the Amarna letters, from 1350 BC, when Damascus (called Dimasqu) was ruled by king Biryawaza. Circa 1260 BC, the Damascus region and the rest of Syria became a battleground between the Hittites from the north and the Egyptians from the south, ending with a signed treaty between Hattusili III and Ramesses II. The former handed over control of the Damascus area to the latter in 1259 BC. The arrival of the Sea Peoples around 1200 BC marked the end of the Bronze Age in the region and brought about new development of warfare. Damascus was only a peripheral part of this picture, which mostly affected the larger population centers of ancient Syria. But these events contributed to Damascus's emergence as an influential center during the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age.\nDamascus is mentioned in Genesis 14:15 as existing at the time of the War of the Kings. According to the 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus's Antiquities of the Jews, Damascus (along with Trachonitis) was founded by Uz, the son of Aram. In Antiquities i. 7, Josephus reports:\n\nNicolaus of Damascus, in the fourth book of his History, says thus: \"Abraham reigned at Damascus, being a foreigner, who came with an army out of the land above Babylon, called the land of the Chaldeans: but, after a long time, he got him up, and removed from that country also, with his people, and went into the land then called the land of Canaan, but now the land of Judea, and this when his posterity became a multitude; as to which posterity of his, we relate their history in another work. Now the name of Abraham is even still famous in the country of Damascus; and there is a village named after him, The Habitation of Abraham.\n\nAram-Damascus\nDamascus is first documented as an important city during the arrival of the Aramaeans, a Semitic people, in the 11th century BC. By the start of the first millennium BC, several Aramaic kingdoms formed, as Aramaeans abandoned their nomadic lifestyle and formed federated tribal states. One of these was Aram-Damascus, centered on its capital, Damascus. The Aramaeans who entered the city without battle adopted the name \"Dimashqu\" for their new home. Noticing the agricultural potential of the still undeveloped and sparsely populated area, they established a water distribution system by constructing canals and tunnels that maximized the efficiency of the river Barada. The Romans and the Umayyads later improved the network, which still forms the basis of the water system of the old part of the city. The Aramaeans initially turned Damascus into an outpost of a loose federation of Aramaean tribes, known as Aram-Zobah, based in the Beqaa Valley.\nThe city gained preeminence in southern Syria when Ezron, the claimant to Aram-Zobah's throne who was denied kingship of the federation, fled Beqaa and captured Damascus by force in 965 BC. He overthrew the city's tribal governor and founded the independent entity of Aram-Damascus. As this state expanded south, it prevented the Kingdom of Israel from spreading north and the two kingdoms soon clashed as they both sought to dominate trading hegemony in the east. Under Ezron's grandson, Ben-Hadad I (880–841 BC), and his successor Hazael, Damascus annexed Bashan (modern-day Hauran region), and went on the offensive with Israel. This conflict continued until the early 8th century BC, when Ben-Hadad II was captured by Israel after unsuccessfully besieging Samaria. As a result, he granted Israel trading rights in Damascus.\nAnother possible reason for the treaty between Aram-Damascus and Israel was the common threat of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which was trying to expand into the Mediterranean coast. In 853 BC, King Hadadezer of Damascus led a Levantine coalition that included forces from the northern Aram-Hamath kingdom and troops supplied by King Ahab of Israel in the Battle of Qarqar against the Neo-Assyrian army. Aram-Damascus was victorious, temporarily preventing the Assyrians from encroaching into Syria. But after Hadadzezer was killed by his successor, Hazael, the Levantine alliance collapsed. Aram-Damascus tried to invade Israel but was interrupted by the renewed Assyrian invasion. Hazael ordered a retreat to the walled part of Damascus while the Assyrians plundered the remainder of the kingdom. Unable to enter the city, they declared their supremacy in the Hauran and Beqa'a valleys.\nBy the 8th century BC, Damascus was practically engulfed by the Assyrians and entered a Dark Age. Nonetheless, it remained the economic and cultural center of the Near East as well as the Arameaen resistance. In 727, a revolt took place in the city but was put down by Assyrian forces. After Assyria led by Tiglath-Pileser III went on a wide-scale campaign of quelling revolts throughout Syria, Damascus became subjugated by their rule. One effect of this was stability for the city and benefits from the spice and incense trade with Arabia. In 694 BC, the town was called Šaʾimerišu (Akkadian: 𒐼𒄿𒈨𒊑𒋙𒌋) and its governor was named Ilu-issīya. Assyrian authority dwindled by 609–605 BC, and Syria-Palestine fell into the orbit of Pharaoh Necho II's Egypt. By 572 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonians had conquered all of Syria, but Damascus's status under Babylon is relatively unknown.\n\nHellenistic period\nDamascus was conquered by Alexander the Great. After his death in 323 BC, it became the site of a struggle between the Seleucid and Ptolemaic empires. Control of the city passed frequently from one empire to the other. Seleucus I Nicator, one of Alexander's generals, made Antioch the capital of his empire, which led to the decline of Damascus's importance compared with new Seleucid cities such as Syrian Laodicea in the north. Later, Demetrius III Philopator rebuilt the city according to the Greek hippodamian system and renamed it \"Demetrias\".\n\nRoman period\nIn 64 BC, the Roman general Pompey annexed the western part of Syria. The Romans occupied Damascus and incorporated it into the league of ten cities known as the Decapolis which itself was incorporated into the province of Syria and granted autonomy.\nDamascus was entirely redesigned by the Romans after Pompey conquered the region. The Old Town of Damascus retains the rectangular shape of the Roman city, with its two main axes: the Decumanus Maximus (east-west; known today as the Via Recta) and the Cardo (north-south), the Decumanus being about twice as long. The Romans built a monumental gate at the eastern end of Decumanus Maximus. The gate originally had three arches, with the central arch for chariots and others for pedestrians.\n\nIn 23 BC, Caesar Augustus gave Herod the Great lands controlled by Zenodorus, and some scholars believe Herod was also granted control of Damascus. Either control of Damascus reverted to Syria upon Herod the Great's death or it was part of the lands given to Herod Philip that were given to Syria with his death in 33/34 AD.\nIt is speculated that control of Damascus was gained by Aretas IV Philopatris of Nabatea between the death of Herod Philip in 33/34 AD and the death of Aretas in 40 AD, but there is substantial evidence that Aretas did not control the city before 37 AD and there are many reasons it could not have been a gift from Caligula between 37 and 40 AD. In fact, all these theories stem not from any actual evidence outside the New Testament but rather \"a certain understanding of 2 Corinthians 11:32\" and in reality \"neither from archaeological evidence, secular-historical sources, nor New Testament texts can Nabatean sovereignty over Damascus in the first century AD be proven.\" Roman emperor Trajan, who annexed the Nabataean Kingdom, creating the province of Arabia Petraea, had previously been in Damascus, as his father Marcus Ulpius Traianus was governor of Syria from 73 to 74 AD, where he met the ethnically Greek architect and engineer Apollodorus of Damascus, who joined him in Rome when he was a consul in 91 AD and built several monuments during the 2nd century.\nDamascus became a metropolis by the beginning of the 2nd century and in 222 it was upgraded to a colonia by Emperor Septimius Severus. During the Pax Romana, Damascus and the entire Roman province of Syria began to prosper. Damascus's importance as a caravan city was evident, with the trade routes from southern Arabia, Palmyra, Petra, and the Silk Road all converging on it. The city satisfied the Roman demands for eastern luxuries. Circa 125 AD the Roman emperor Hadrian promoted the city of Damascus to \"Metropolis of Coele-Syria\".\nLittle remains of the architecture of the Romans, but the town planning of the old city had a lasting effect. Roman architects brought together the city's Greek and Aramaean foundations and fused them into a new layout measuring about 1,500 by 750 m (4,920 by 2,460 ft), surrounded by a wall. The wall had seven gates, but only the eastern gate, Bab Sharqi, remains. Roman Damascus lies mostly at depths of up to five meters (16 feet) below the modern city.\n\nThe old borough of Bab Tuma was developed at the end of the Roman/Byzantine era by the local Eastern Orthodox community. According to the Acts of the Apostles, Saint Paul and Saint Thomas both lived in that neighborhood. Roman Catholic historians also consider Bab Tuma the birthplace of several Popes, such as John V and Gregory III. Accordingly, a community of Jewish Christians converted to Christianity with the advent of Saint Paul's proselytization.\nDuring the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the city was besieged and captured by Shahrbaraz in 613 along with a large number of Byzantine troops as prisoners. It was in Sasanian hands until near the end of the war.\n\nRashidun period\nThe Prophet Muhammad's first indirect interaction with the people of Damascus was when he sent a letter, through his companion Shiya ibn Wahab, to Harith ibn Abi Shamir, the king of Damascus. The letter stated: \"Peace be upon him who follows true guidance. Be informed that my religion shall prevail everywhere. You should accept Islam, and whatever under your command shall remain yours.\"\n\nAfter most of the Syrian countryside was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate during the reign of Caliph Umar (r. 634–644), Damascus itself was conquered by the Arab Muslim general Khalid ibn al-Walid in August–September 634 CE. His army had previously attempted to capture the city in April 634 but without success. With Damascus now in Muslim-Arab hands, the Byzantines, alarmed at the loss of their most prestigious city in the Near East, had decided to wrest back control of it. Under Emperor Heraclius, the Byzantines fielded an army superior to that of the Rashidun in manpower. They advanced into southern Syria during the spring of 636 and consequently Khalid ibn al-Walid's forces withdrew from Damascus to prepare for renewed confrontation. In August, the two sides met along the Yarmouk River where they fought a major battle which ended in a decisive Muslim victory, solidifying Muslim rule in Syria and Palestine. While the Muslims administered the city, the population of Damascus remained mostly Christian—Eastern Orthodox and Monophysite—with a growing community of Muslims from Mecca, Medina, and the Syrian Desert. The governor assigned to the city which had been chosen as the capital of Islamic Syria was Mu'awiya I.\n\nUmayyad and Abbasid periods\nFollowing the fourth Rashidun caliph Ali's death in 661, Mu'awiya was chosen as the caliph of the expanding Islamic empire. Because of the vast amounts of assets his clan, the Umayyads, owned in the city and because of its traditional economic and social links with the Hijaz as well as the Christian Arab tribes of the region, Mu'awiya established Damascus as the capital of the entire Caliphate. With the ascension of Caliph Abd al-Malik in 685, an Islamic coinage system was introduced, and all the surplus revenue of the Caliphate's provinces was forwarded to the treasury of Damascus. Arabic was also established as the official language, giving the city's Muslim minority an advantage over the Aramaic-speaking Christians in administrative affairs.\nAbd al-Malik's successor al-Walid initiated the construction of the Grand Mosque of Damascus (known as the Umayyad Mosque) in 706. The site originally had been the Christian Cathedral of St. John and the Muslims maintained the building's dedication to John the Baptist. By 715, the mosque was complete. Al-Walid died that same year and was succeeded at first by Suleiman ibn Abd al-Malik and then by Umar II, who each ruled for brief periods before the reign of Hisham in 724. With these successions, the status of Damascus was gradually weakening, as Suleiman chose Ramla as his residence and Hisham chose Resafa. Following the murder of the latter in 743, the Caliphate of the Umayyads—which by then stretched from Spain to India—was crumbling as a result of widespread revolts. During the reign of Marwan II in 744, the capital of the empire was relocated to Harran in the Jazira region.\n\nOn 25 August 750, the Abbasids, having already beaten the Umayyads in the Battle of the Zab in Iraq, conquered Damascus after facing little resistance. With the heralding of the Abbasid Caliphate, Damascus became eclipsed and subordinated by Baghdad, the new Islamic capital. Within the first six months of Abbasid rule, revolts began erupting in the city, albeit too isolated and unfocused to present a viable threat. Nonetheless, the last of the prominent Umayyads were executed, the traditional officials of Damascus were ostracised, and army generals from the city were dismissed. Afterwards, the Umayyad family cemetery was desecrated and the city walls were torn down, reducing Damascus into a provincial town of little importance. It mostly disappeared from written records for the next century, and the only significant improvement of the city was the Abbasid-built treasury dome in the Umayyad Mosque in 789. In 811, distant remnants of the Umayyad dynasty staged a strong uprising in Damascus that was eventually put down.\nOn 24 November 847, a multiple earthquake struck and destroyed Damascus, killing about 70,000 people.\nAhmad ibn Tulun, a dissenting Turkish wali appointed by the Abbasids, conquered Syria, including Damascus, from his overlords in 878–79. Out of respect for the Umayyad rulers, he erected a shrine on the site of Mu'awiya's grave. Tulunid rule of Damascus was brief, lasting only until 906 before being replaced by the Qarmatians, who adhered to Shia Islam. Due to their inability to control the vast land they occupied, the Qarmatians withdrew from Damascus and a new dynasty, the Ikhshidids, took control of it. They maintained the independence of Damascus from the Arab Hamdanid dynasty of Aleppo 967. A period of instability in the city followed, with a Qarmatian raid in 968, a Byzantine raid in 970, and increasing pressures from the Fatimids in the south and the Hamdanids in the north.\n\nThe Shia Fatimids gained control in 970, inflaming hostilities between them and the city's Sunni Arabs, who frequently revolted. The Turk Alptakin drove out the Fatimids five years later, and through diplomacy, prevented the Byzantines during the Syrian campaigns of John Tzimiskes from attempting to annex the city. But by 977, the Fatimids under Caliph al-Aziz wrested control of the city back and tamed Sunni dissidents. The Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi visited Damascus in 985, remarking that the architecture and infrastructure of the city were \"magnificent\" but living conditions were awful. Under al-Aziz, the city saw a brief period of stability that ended with the reign of al-Hakim (996–1021). In 998, he executed hundreds of Damascus citizens for incitement. Three years after his mysterious disappearance, a rebellion began in southern Syria against the Fatimids but was stifled by the Fatimid Turkish governor of Syria and Palestine, Anushtakin al-Duzbari, in 1029. This victory gave him mastery over Syria, displeasing his Fatimid overlords but gaining the admiration of Damascus's citizens. He was exiled by Fatimid authorities to Aleppo, where he died in 1041. From that date to 1063, there are no known records of the city's history. By then, Damascus lacked a city administration and had an enfeebled economy and a greatly reduced population.\n\nSeljuq and Ayyubid periods\nWith the arrival of the Seljuq Turks in the late 11th century, Damascus again became the capital of independent states. It was ruled by Abu Sa'id Taj ad-Dawla Tutush I starting in 1079 and he was succeeded by his son Abu Nasr Duqaq in 1095. The Seljuqs established a court in Damascus and a systematic reversal of Shia inroads in the city. The city also saw an expansion of religious life through private endowments financing religious institutions (madrasas) and hospitals (maristans). Damascus soon became one of the most important centers of propagating Islamic thought in the Muslim world. After Duqaq died in 1104, his mentor (atabeg), Toghtekin, took control of Damascus and the Burid line of the Seljuq dynasty. Under Duqaq and Toghtekin, Damascus experienced stability, elevated status, and a revived role in commerce. In addition, the city's Sunni majority enjoyed being a part of the larger Sunni framework effectively governed by various Turkic dynasties who in turn were under the moral authority of the Baghdad-based Abbasids.\nWhile the rulers of Damascus were preoccupied in conflict with their fellow Seljuqs in Aleppo and Diyarbakir, the Crusaders, who arrived in the Levant in 1097, conquered Jerusalem, Mount Lebanon and Palestine. Duqaq seemed to have been content with Crusader's rule as a buffer between his dominion and the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt. Toghtekin, however, saw the Western invaders as a viable threat to Damascus which, at the time, nominally included Homs, the Beqaa Valley, Hauran, and the Golan Heights as part of its territories. With military support from Sharaf al-Din Mawdud of Mosul, Toghtekin managed to halt Crusader raids in the Golan and Hauran. Mawdud was assassinated in the Umayyad Mosque in 1109, depriving Damascus of northern Muslim backing and forcing Toghtekin to agree to a truce with the Crusaders in 1110. In 1126, the Crusader army led by Baldwin II fought Burid forces led by Toghtekin at Marj al-Saffar near Damascus; however, despite their tactical victory, the Crusaders failed in their objective to capture Damascus.\n\nFollowing Toghtekin's death in 1128, his son, Taj al-Muluk Buri, became the nominal ruler of Damascus. Coincidentally, the Seljuq prince of Mosul, Imad al-Din Zengi, took power in Aleppo and gained a mandate from the Abbasids to extend his authority to Damascus. In 1129, around 6,000 Isma'ili Muslims were killed in the city along with their leaders. The Sunnis were provoked by rumors alleging there was a plot by the Isma'ilis, who controlled the strategic fort at Banias, to aid the Crusaders in capturing Damascus in return for control of Tyre. Soon after the massacre, the Crusaders aimed to take advantage of the unstable situation and launch an assault against Damascus with nearly 2,000 knights and 10,000 infantry. However, Buri allied with Zengi and managed to prevent their army from reaching the city. Buri was assassinated by Isma'ili agents in 1132; he was succeeded by his son, Shams al-Mulk Isma'il who ruled tyrannically until he was murdered in 1135 on secret orders from his mother, Safwat al-Mulk Zumurrud; Isma'il's brother, Shihab al-Din Mahmud, replaced him. Meanwhile, Zengi, intent on putting Damascus under his control, married Safwat al-Mulk in 1138. Mahmud's reign then ended in 1139 after he was killed for relatively unknown reasons by members of his family. Mu'in al-Din Unur, his mamluk (\"slave soldier\") took effective power of the city, prompting Zengi—with Safwat al-Mulk's backing—to lay siege against Damascus the same year. In response, Damascus allied with the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem to resist Zengi's forces. Consequently, Zengi withdrew his army and focused on campaigns against northern Syria.\nIn 1144, Zengi conquered Edessa, a crusader stronghold, which led to a new crusade from Europe in 1148. In the meantime, Zengi was assassinated and his territory was divided among his sons, one of whom, Nur ad-Din, emir of Aleppo, made an alliance with Damascus. When the European crusaders arrived, they and the nobles of Jerusalem agreed to attack Damascus. Their siege, however, was a complete failure. When the city seemed to be on the verge of collapse, the crusader army suddenly moved against another section of the walls and was driven back. By 1154, Damascus was firmly under Nur ad-Din's control.\nIn 1164, King Amalric of Jerusalem invaded Fatimid Egypt, requested help from Nur ad-Din. The Nur ad-Din sent his general Shirkuh, and in 1166 Amalric was defeated at the Battle of al-Babein. When Shirkuh died in 1169, he was succeeded by his nephew Yusuf, better known as Saladin, who defeated a joint crusader-Byzantine siege of Damietta. Saladin eventually overthrew the Fatimid caliphs and established himself as Sultan of Egypt. He also began to assert his independence from Nur ad-Din, and with the death of both Amalric and Nur ad-Din in 1174, he was well-placed to begin exerting control over Damascus and Nur ad-Din's other Syrian possessions. In 1177 Saladin was defeated by the crusaders at the Battle of Montgisard, despite his numerical superiority. Saladin also besieged Kerak in 1183, but was forced to withdraw. He finally launched a full invasion of Jerusalem in 1187 and annihilated the crusader army at the Battle of Hattin in July. Acre fell to Saladin soon after, and Jerusalem itself was captured in October. These events shocked Europe, resulting in the Third Crusade in 1189, led by Richard I of England, Philip II of France and Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, though the last drowned en route.\nThe surviving crusaders, joined by new arrivals from Europe, put Acre to a lengthy siege which lasted until 1191. After re-capturing Acre, Richard defeated Saladin at the Battle of Arsuf in 1191 and the Battle of Jaffa in 1192, recovering most of the coast for the Christians, but could not recover Jerusalem or any of the inland territory of the kingdom. The crusade came to an end peacefully, with the Treaty of Jaffa in 1192. Saladin allowed pilgrimages to be made to Jerusalem, allowing the Crusaders to fulfill their vows, after which they all returned home. Local crusader barons set about rebuilding their kingdom from Acre and the other coastal cities.\nSaladin died in 1193, and there were frequent conflicts between different Ayyubid sultans ruling in Damascus and Cairo. Damascus was the capital of independent Ayyubid rulers between 1193 and 1201, from 1218 to 1238, from 1239 to 1245, and from 1250 to 1260. At other times it was ruled by the Ayyubid rulers of Egypt. During the internecine wars fought by the Ayyubid rulers, Damascus was besieged repeatedly, as, e.g., in 1229.\nThe patterned Byzantine and Chinese silks available through Damascus, one of the Western termini of the Silk Road, gave the English language \"damask\".\n\nMamluk period\nAyyubid rule (and independence) came to an end with the Mongol invasion of Syria in 1260, in which the Mongols led by Kitbuqa entered the city on 1 March 1260, along with the King of Armenia, Hethum I, and the Prince of Antioch, Bohemond VI; hence, the citizens of Damascus saw for the first time for six centuries three Christian potentates ride in triumph through their streets. However, following the Mongol defeat at Ain Jalut on 3 September 1260, Damascus was captured five days later and became the provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate, ruled from Egypt, following the Mongol withdrawal. Following their victory at the Battle of Wadi al-Khaznadar, the Mongols led by Ghazan besieged the city for ten days, which surrendered between 30 December 1299, and 6 January 1300, though its Citadel resisted. Ghazan then retreated with most of his forces in February, probably because the Mongol horses needed fodder, and left behind about 10,000 horsemen under the Mongol general Mulay. Around March 1300, Mulay returned with his horsemen to Damascus, then followed Ghazan back across the Euphrates. In May 1300, the Egyptian Mamluks returned from Egypt and reclaimed the entire area without a battle. In April 1303, the Mamluks managed to defeat the Mongol army led by Kutlushah and Mulay along with their Armenian allies at the Battle of Marj al-Saffar, to put an end to Mongol invasions of the Levant. Later on, the Black Death of 1348–1349 killed as much as half of the city's population.\nIn 1400, Timur, the Turco-Mongol conqueror, besieged Damascus. The Mamluk sultan dispatched a deputation from Cairo, including Ibn Khaldun, who negotiated with him, but after their withdrawal, Timur sacked the city on 17 March 1401. The Umayyad Mosque was burnt and men and women were taken into slavery. A huge number of the city's artisans were taken to Timur's capital at Samarkand. These were the luckier citizens: many were slaughtered and their heads piled up in a field outside the north-east corner of the walls, where a city square still bears the name Burj al-Ru'us (between modern-day Al-Qassaa and Bab Tuma), originally \"the tower of heads\".\nRebuilt, Damascus continued to serve as a Mamluk provincial capital until 1516.\n\nOttoman period\nIn early 1516, the Ottoman Empire, wary of the danger of an alliance between the Mamluks and the Persian Safavids, started a campaign of conquest against the Mamluk sultanate. On 21 September, the Mamluk governor of Damascus fled the city, and on 2 October the khutba in the Umayyad mosque was pronounced in the name of Selim I. The day after, the victorious sultan entered the city, staying for three months. On 15 December, he left Damascus by Bab al-Jabiya, intent on the conquest of Egypt. Little appeared to have changed in the city: one army had simply replaced another. However, on his return in October 1517, the sultan ordered the construction of a mosque, tekkiye and mausoleum at the shrine of Shaikh Muhi al-Din ibn Arabi in al-Salihiyah. This was to be the first of Damascus's great Ottoman monuments.\nDuring this time, according to an Ottoman census, Damascus had 10,423 households.\nThe Ottomans remained for the next 400 years, except for a brief occupation by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt from 1832 to 1840. Because of its importance as the point of departure for one of the two great Hajj caravans to Mecca, Damascus was treated with more attention by the Porte than its size might have warranted—for most of this period, Aleppo was more populous and commercially more important. In 1559 the western building of Sulaymaniyya Takiyya, comprising a mosque and khan for pilgrims on the road to Mecca, was completed to a design by the famous Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan, and soon afterward the Salimiyya Madrasa was built adjoining it.\n\nEarly in the nineteenth century, Damascus was noted for its shady cafes along the banks of the Barada. A depiction of these by William Henry Bartlett was published in 1836, along with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, see  Cafes in Damascus. Under Ottoman rule, Christians and Jews were considered dhimmis and were allowed to practice their religious precepts. During the Damascus affair of 1840 the false accusation of ritual murder was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus. The massacre of Christians in 1860 was also one of the most notorious incidents of these centuries when fighting between Druze and Maronites in Mount Lebanon spilled over into the city. Several thousand Christians were killed in June 1860, with many more being saved through the intervention of the Algerian exile Abd al-Qadir and his soldiers (three days after the massacre started), who brought them to safety in Abd al-Qadir's residence and the Citadel of Damascus. The Christian quarter of the old city (mostly inhabited by Catholics), including several churches, was burnt down. The Christian inhabitants of the notoriously poor and refractory Midan district outside the walls (mostly Orthodox) were, however, protected by their Muslim neighbors.\n\nAmerican Missionary E.C. Miller records that in 1867 the population of the city was 'about' 140,000, of whom 30,000 were Christians, 10,000 Jews, and 100,000 'Mohammedans' with fewer than 100 Protestant Christians. In the meantime, American writer Mark Twain visited Damascus, then wrote about his travel in The Innocents Abroad, in which he mentioned: \"Though old as history itself, thou art fresh as the breath of spring, blooming as thine own rose-bud, and fragrant as thine own orange flower, O Damascus, pearl of the East!\". In November 1898, German emperor Wilhelm II toured Damascus, during his trip to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nModern period\n20th century\nIn the early years of the 20th century, nationalist sentiment in Damascus, initially cultural in its interest, began to take a political coloring, largely in reaction to the turkicisation program of the Committee of Union and Progress government established in Istanbul in 1908. The hanging of a number of patriotic intellectuals by Jamal Pasha, governor of Damascus, in Beirut and Damascus in 1915 and 1916 further stoked nationalist feeling, and in 1918, as the forces of the Arab Revolt and the British Imperial forces approached, residents fired on the retreating Turkish troops.\n\nOn 1 October 1918, T. E. Lawrence entered Damascus, the third arrival of the day, the first being the Australian 3rd Light Horse Brigade, led by Major A.C.N. 'Harry' Olden. Two days later, 3 October 1918, the forces of the Arab revolt led by Prince Faisal also entered Damascus. A military government under Shukri Pasha was named and Faisal ibn Hussein was proclaimed king of Syria. Political tension arose in November 1917, when the new Bolshevik government in Russia revealed the Sykes-Picot Agreement whereby Britain and France had arranged to partition the Arab East between them. A new Franco-British proclamation on 17 November promised the \"complete and definitive freeing of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks.\" The Syrian National Congress in March adopted a democratic constitution. However, the Versailles Conference had granted France a mandate over Syria, and in 1920 a French army commanded by the General Mariano Goybet crossed the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, defeated a small Syrian defensive expedition at the Battle of Maysalun and entered Damascus. The French made Damascus the capital of their League of Nations Mandate for Syria.\nWhen in 1925 the Great Syrian Revolt in the Hauran spread to Damascus, the French suppressed it with heavy weaponry, bombing and shelling the city on 9 May 1926. As a result, the area of the old city between Al-Hamidiyah Souq and Medhat Pasha Souq was burned to the ground, with many deaths, and has since then been known as al-Hariqa (\"the fire\"). The old city was surrounded with barbed wire to prevent rebels from infiltrating the Ghouta, and a new road was built outside the northern ramparts to facilitate the movement of armored cars. Reporter George Seldes viewed 308 bodies, and suggested there might be more dead under the rubble—and that a maximum might be one thousand.  \"When the Muslims, who had rebelled, threatened to kill all Christians, General Maurice Sarrail gave the civilian population time to evacuate, then ordered Fort Gouraud to fire some warning shots, then shell the rebel sector.\"  \nOn 21 June 1941, 3 weeks into the Allied Syria-Lebanon campaign, Damascus was captured from the Vichy French forces by a mixed British Indian and Free French force. The French agreed to withdraw in 1946, following the British intervention during the Levant Crisis, thus leading to the full independence of Syria. Damascus remained the capital and has been unchanged even following the start of Ba'athist rule in 1963.\nIn 1979, the Old City of Damascus, with its collection of archaeological and historical religious sites, was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\n\nCivil war\nBy January 2012, clashes between the regular army and rebels reached the outskirts of Damascus, reportedly preventing people from leaving or reaching their houses, especially when security operations there intensified from the end of January into February.\nBy June 2012, bullets and shrapnel shells smashed into homes in Damascus overnight as troops battled the Free Syrian Army in the streets. At least three tank shells slammed into residential areas in the central Damascus neighborhood of Qaboun, according to activists. Intense exchanges of assault rifle fire marked the clash, according to residents and amateur video posted online.\nThe Damascus suburb of Ghouta suffered heavy bombing in December 2017 and a further wave of bombing started in February 2018, also known as Rif Dimashq Offensive.\nOn 20 May 2018, Damascus and the entire Rif Dimashq Governorate came fully under government control for the first time in 7 years after the evacuation of IS from Yarmouk Camp. In September 2019, Damascus entered the Guinness World Records as the least liveable city, scoring 30.7 points on the Economist's Global Liveability Index in 2019, based on factors such as: stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure. However, the trend of being the least liveable city on Earth started in 2017, and continued as of 2024.\n\nSyrian rebels, led by the HTS rebel group entered Damascus on 8 December 2024 after a series of offensives, capturing Sednaya Prison and later resulting in the collapse of Ba'athist Syria.\nOn 23 February 2025, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded the complete demilitarization of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Daraa and Suweyda, and the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Syrian territory south of Damascus. Syria's new government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa rejected Netanyahu's demands. Hours later, Israel conducted a wave of airstrikes in Damascus and southern Syria.\n\nEconomy\nThe historical role that Damascus played as an important trade center has changed in recent years due to political development in the region as well as the development of modern trade. Most goods produced in Damascus, as well as in Syria, are distributed to countries of the Arabian peninsula. Damascus has also held an annual international trade exposition every fall, since 1954.\nThe tourism industry in Damascus has a lot of potential, however, the civil war has hampered these prospects. The abundance of cultural wealth in Damascus has been modestly employed since the late 1980s with the development of many accommodation and transportation establishments and other related investments. Since the early 2000s, numerous boutique hotels and bustling cafes opened in the old city which attracts plenty of European tourists and Damascenes alike.\nIn 2009 new office space was built and became available on the real estate market. Marota City and Basilia City are two new development projects in Damascus. These two projects are viewed as post-war reconstruction efforts. The Damascus stock exchange formally opened for trade in March 2009, and the exchange is the only stock exchange in Syria. It is located in the Barzeh district, within Syria's financial markets and securities commission. Its final home is to be located in the upmarket business district of Yaafur.\nDamascus is home to a wide range of industrial activities, such as textile, food processing, cement, and various chemical industries. The majority of factories are run by the state, however limited privatization in addition to economic activities led by the private sector, were permitted starting in the early 2000s with the liberalization of trade that took place.\nTraditional handcrafts and artisan copper engravings are still produced in the old city.\n\nDemographics\nPopulation\nIn the 2004 Census of Population conducted by Central Bureau of Statistics (Syria), Damascus had a population of 1,552,161 living in 309,317 of its 345,097 total dwellings.\nDamascus is the center of a crowded metropolitan area with an estimated population of 5 million. The metropolitan area of Damascus includes the cities of Douma, Harasta, Darayya, Al-Tall and Jaramana.\nThe city's growth rate is higher than in Syria as a whole, primarily due to rural-urban migration and the influx of young Syrian migrants drawn by employment and educational opportunities. The migration of Syrian youths to Damascus has resulted in an average age within the city that is below the national average. Nonetheless, the population of Damascus is thought to have decreased in recent years as a result of the ongoing Syrian civil war.\n\nEthnicity\nThe vast majority of Damascenes are Syrian Arabs. The Kurds are the second largest ethnic minority, with a population of approximately 300,000. They reside primarily in the neighborhoods of Wadi al-Mashari (\"Zorava\" or \"Zore Afa\" in Kurdish) and Rukn al-Din. Other minorities include Palestinians, Armenians, Assyrians, Turkmens, Circassians and a small Greek community.\n\nReligion\nIslam is the largest religion. The majority of Muslims are Sunni while Alawites and Twelver Shi'a comprise sizeable minorities. Alawites live primarily in the neighbourhoods of Mezzeh 86 and Sumariyah part of the Mezzeh district, in addition to the neighbourhood of Eish al-Warwar in the district of Barzeh. Twelvers primarily live near the Shia holy sites of Sayyidah Ruqayya and Sayyidah Zaynab. It is believed that there are more than 200 mosques in Damascus, the most well-known being the Umayyad Mosque.\nChristians represent about 10%–15% of the population. Several Eastern Christian rites have their headquarters in Damascus, including the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Syriac Catholic Church, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, and the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch. The Christian districts in the city are Bab Tuma, Qassaa and Ghassani. Each have many churches, most notably the ancient Chapel of Saint Paul, St. Paul Cathedral, Our Lady of the Dormition Cathedral, and St Georges Cathedral in Bab Tuma. At the suburb of Soufanieh a series of apparitions of the Virgin Mary have reportedly been observed between 1982 and 2004. The Patriarchal See of the Syriac Orthodox is based in Damascus, Bab Touma.\nA smaller Druze minority inhabits the city, notably in the mixed Christian-Druze suburbs of Tadamon, Jaramana, and Sahnaya.\nThere was a small Jewish community namely in what is called Harat al-Yahud (\"the Jewish quarter\"). They are the remnants of an ancient and much larger Jewish presence in Syria, dating back at least to Roman times, if not before to the time of King David. There was once a significant Jewish community in Damascus, but as of 2023, no Jews remain.\n\nSufism\nSufism throughout the second half of the 20th century has been an influential current in the Sunni religious practises, particularly in Damascus. The largest women-only and girls-only Muslim movement in the world happens to be Sufi-oriented and is based in Damascus, led by Munira al-Qubaysi. Syrian Sufism has its stronghold in urban regions such as Damascus, where it also established political movements such as Zayd, with the help of a series of mosques, and clergy such as Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi, Sa'id Hawwa, Abd al-Rahman al-Shaghouri and Muhammad al-Yaqoubi.\n\nHistorical sites\nThe Ancient City of Damascus was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1979. Beginning with the Aramaic kingdom (11th-7th centuries BC), Damascus grew into the political and urban hub for the region. Today, the ancient city encompasses over 125 cultural heritage sites that represent Damascus's long history, including archaeological and architectural remains from the Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Islamic, and Ottoman periods. Tragically, ongoing conflict and war continues to threaten the archaeological heritage and prevent archaeological discovery of Damascus.\n\nThe Citadel of Damascus is in the northwest corner of the Old City. The Damascus Straight Street (referred to in the account of the conversion of St. Paul in Acts 9:11), also known as the Via Recta, was the decumanus (east–west main street) of Roman Damascus, and extended for over 1,500 m (4,900 ft). Today, it consists of the street of Bab Sharqi and the Souk Medhat Pasha, a covered market. The Bab Sharqi street is filled with small shops and leads to the old Christian quarter of Bab Tuma (St. Thomas's Gate), where St George's Cathedral, the seat of the Syriac Orthodox Church, is notably located. Medhat Pasha Souq is also a main market in Damascus and was named after Midhat Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Syria who renovated the Souk. At the end of Bab Sharqi Street, one reaches the House of Ananias, an underground chapel that was the cellar of Ananias's house. The Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus, is one of the largest mosques in the world and also one of the oldest sites of continuous prayer since the rise of Islam. A shrine in the mosque is said to contain the body of St. John the Baptist. The mausoleum where Saladin was buried is located in the gardens just outside the mosque. Sayyidah Ruqayya Mosque, the shrine of the youngest daughter of Husayn ibn Ali, can also be found near the Umayyad Mosque. The ancient district of Amara is also within walking distance from these sites. Another heavily visited site is Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque, where the tomb of Zaynab bint Ali is located. Shias, Fatemids, and Dawoodi Bohras believe that after the battle of Karbala (680 AD), in Iraq, the Umayyad Caliph Yezid brought Imam Husain's head to Damascus, where it was first kept in the courtyard of Yezid Mahal, now part of Umayyad Mosque complex. All other remaining members of Imam Husain's family (left alive after Karbala) along with the heads of all other companions, who were killed at Karbala, were also brought to Damascus. These members were kept as prisoners on the outskirts of the city (near Bab al-Saghir), where the other heads were kept at the same location, now called Ru'ûs ash-Shuhadâ-e-Karbala or ganj-e-sarha-e-shuhada-e-Karbala. There is a qibla (place of worship) marked at the place, where devotees say Imam Ali-Zain-ul-Abedin used to pray while in captivity.\nThe Harat Al Yehud or Jewish Quarter is a recently restored historical tourist destination popular among Europeans before the outbreak of civil war. Vacationers can enjoy the neighborhood and scenic ancient homes abandoned by the completely departed Syrian Jewish community.\n\nWalls and gates of Damascus\nThe Old City of Damascus with an approximate area of 86.12 hectares is surrounded by ramparts on the northern and eastern sides and part of the southern side. There are seven extant city gates, the oldest of which dates back to the Roman period. These are, clockwise from the north of the citadel:\n\nBab al-Faradis (\"the gate of the orchards\", or \"of the paradise\")\nBab al-Salam (\"the gate of peace\"), all on the north boundary of the Old City\nBab Tuma (\"Touma\" or \"Thomas's Gate\") in the north-east corner, leading into the Christian quarter of the same name,\nBab Sharqi (\"eastern gate\") in the east wall, the only one to retain its Roman plan\nBab Kisan in the south-east, from which tradition holds that Saint Paul made his escape from Damascus, lowered from the ramparts in a basket; this gate has been closed and turned into Chapel of Saint Paul marking this event,\nBab al-Saghir (The Small Gate)\nBab al-Jabiya at the entrance to Souk Midhat Pasha, in the southwest.\nOther areas outside the walled city also bear the name \"gate\": Bab al-Faraj, Bab Mousalla and Bab Sreija, both to the south-west of the walled city.\n\nChurches in the old city\nChapel of Saint Paul\nHouse of Saint Ananias\nMariamite Cathedral of Damascus\nCathedral of the Dormition of Our Lady\nSaint John the Damascene Church\nSaint Paul's Laura\nSaint George's Syriac Orthodox Cathedral\n\nIslamic sites in the old city\nUmayyad Mosque, also known as the Great Mosque of Damascus\nSayyidah Ruqayya Mosque\nBab Saghir Cemetery\nMausoleum of Saladin\nNabi Habeel Mosque\n\nMadrasas\nAl-Adiliyah Madrasa\nAz-Zahiriyah Library\nNur al-Din Madrasa\n\nKhans\nKhan Jaqmaq\nKhan As'ad Pasha\nKhan Sulayman Pasha\n\nOld Damascene houses\nAzm Palace, originally built in 1750 as the residence for the Ottoman governor of Damascus As'ad Pasha al-Azm, housing the Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions.\nBayt al-Aqqad\nBayt Farhi, a large late-18th-century courtyard Jewish mansion built for the prominent Farhi family.\nMaktab Anbar, a mid-19th-century Jewish private mansion, restored by the Ministry of Culture in 1976 to serve as a library, exhibition center, museum and craft workshops.\nBeit al-Mamlouka, a 17th-century Damascene house, serving as a luxury boutique hotel within the old city since 2005.\n\nThreats to the future of the old City\nDue to the rapid decline of the population of Old Damascus (between 1995 and 2009 about 30,000 people moved out of the old city for more modern accommodation), a growing number of buildings are being abandoned or are falling into disrepair. In March 2007, the local government announced that it would be demolishing Old City buildings along a 1,400 m (4,600 ft) stretch of rampart walls as part of a redevelopment scheme. These factors resulted in the Old City being placed by the World Monuments Fund on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world. It is hoped that its inclusion on the list will draw more public awareness to these significant threats to the future of the historic Old City of Damascus.\n\nState of old Damascus\nIn spite of the recommendations of the UNESCO World Heritage Center:\n\nSouq al-Atiq, a protected buffer zone, was destroyed in three days in November 2006;\nKing Faysal Street, a traditional hand-craft region in a protected buffer zone near the walls of Old Damascus between the Citadel and Bab Touma, is threatened by a proposed motorway.\nIn 2007, the Old City of Damascus and notably the district of Bab Tuma have been recognized by The World Monument Fund as one of the most endangered sites in the world.\nIn October 2010, Global Heritage Fund named Damascus one of 12 cultural heritage sites most \"on the verge\" of irreparable loss and destruction.\n\nEducation\nDamascus is the main center of education in Syria. It is home to Damascus University, which is the oldest and largest university in Syria. After the enactment of legislation allowing private higher institutions, several new universities were established in the city and the surrounding area, including:\n\nSyrian Virtual University\nInternational University for Science and Technology\nSyrian Private University\nArab International University\nUniversity of Kalamoon\nYarmouk Private University\nWadi International University\nAl-Jazeera University\nEuropean University Damascus\nThe institutes play an important rule in the education, including:\n\nHigher Institute of Business Administration\nHigher Institute of Applied Science and Technology\nHigher Institute of Dramatic Arts\nNational Institute of Administration\nIn Damascus, Higher education in Syrian Arab Republic started with sustainable development steps through Damascus University. \n\nAdditional:\nSyrian International Academy for Training and Development\n\nTransportation\nDamascus is linked with other major cities in Syria via a motorway network. The M5 connects Damascus with Homs, Hama, Aleppo and Turkey in the north and Jordan in the south. The M1 is going from Homs onto Latakia and Tartus.\nThe M4 links the city with Al-Hasakah and Iraq. The M1 highway connects the city to western Syria and Beirut.\nThe main airport is Damascus International Airport, approximately 20 km (12 mi) away from the city, with connections to a few Middle Eastern cities. Before the beginning of the Syrian civil war, the airport had connectivity to many Asian, European, African, and, South American cities.\n\nStreets in Damascus are often narrow, especially in the older parts of the city, and speed bumps are widely used to limit the speed of vehicles. Many taxi companies operate in Damascus. Fares are regulated by law and taxi drivers are obliged to use a taximeter.\nPublic transport in Damascus depends extensively on buses and minibuses. There are about one hundred lines that operate inside the city and some of them extend from the city center to nearby suburbs. There is no schedule for the lines, and due to the limited number of official bus stops, buses will usually stop wherever a passenger needs to get on or off. The number of buses serving the same line is relatively high, which minimizes the waiting time. Lines are not numbered, rather they are given captions mostly indicating the two endpoints and possibly an important station along the line. Between 2019 and 2022, more than 100 modern buses were delivered from China as part of the international agreement. These deliveries strengthened and modernized the public transport of Damascus.\nServed by Syrian Railways, the former main railway station of Damascus was al-Hejaz railway station, about 1 km (5⁄8 mi) west of the old city. The station is now defunct and the tracks have been removed, but there still is a ticket counter and a shuttle to Damascus Qadam station in the south of the city, which now functions as the main railway station.\nIn 2008, the government announced a plan to construct a Damascus Metro. The green line will be an essential west–east axis for the future public transportation network, serving Moadamiyeh, Sumariyeh, Mezzeh, Damascus University, Hijaz, the Old City, Abbassiyeen and Qaboun Pullman bus station. A four-line metro network is expected to be in operation by 2050.\n\nCulture\nDamascus was chosen as the 2008 Arab Capital of Culture. The preparation for the festivity began in February 2007 with the establishing of the Administrative Committee for \"Damascus Arab Capital of Culture\" by a presidential decree. Museums in Damascus includes National Museum of Damascus, Azem Palace, Military Museum, October War Panorama Museum, Museum of Arabic Calligraphy and Nur al-Din Bimaristan\n\nSports and leisure\nPopular sports include football, basketball, swimming, tennis, table tennis, equestrian and chess. Damascus is home to many football clubs that participate in the Syrian Premier League including al-Jaish, al-Shorta, Al-Wahda and Al-Majd. Many Other sports clubs are located in several districts of the city: Barada SC, Al-Nidal SC, Al-Muhafaza, Qasioun SC, al-Thawra SC, Maysalun SC, al-Fayhaa SC, Dummar SC, al-Majd SC and al-Arin SC.\nThe fifth and the seventh Pan Arab Games were held in Damascus in 1976 and 1992 respectively.\nThe now modernized Al-Fayhaa Sports City features a basketball court and a hall that can accommodate up to 8,000 people. In late November 2021, Syria's national basketball team played there against Kazakhstan, making Damascus host of Syria's first international basketball tournament in almost two decades.\nThe city also has a modern golf course located near the Ebla Cham Palace Hotel on the southeastern outskirts of Damascus.\nDamascus has a busy nightlife. Coffeehouses offer Arabic coffee, tea and  nargileh (water pipes). Card games, tables (backgammon variants), and chess are activities frequented in cafés. These coffeehouses had an international reputation in the past, as indicated by Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poetical illustration, Cafes in Damascus, to a picture by William Henry Bartlett in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837. Current movies can be seen at Cinema City which was previously known as Cinema Dimashq.\n\nTishreen Park is one of the largest parks in Damascus. It is home to the annual Damascus Flower Show. Other parks include al-Jahiz, al-Sibbki, al-Tijara, al-Wahda, etc... The city's famous Ghouta oasis is also a weekend destination for recreation. Many recreation centers operate in the city including sports clubs, swimming pools, and golf courses. The Syrian Arab Horse Association in Damascus offers a wide range of activities and services for horse breeders and riders.\n\nNearby attractions\nMadaya: a small mountainous town and well-known holiday resort.\nBloudan: a town located 51 km (32 mi) north-west of Damascus, its moderate temperature and low humidity in summer attracts many visitors from Damascus and throughout Syria, Lebanon and the Persian Gulf.\nZabadani: a city close to the border with Lebanon. Its mild weather along with the scenic views, made the town a popular resort both for tourists and for visitors from other Syrian cities.\nMaaloula: a town dominated by speakers of Western Neo-Aramaic.\nSaidnaya: a city located in the mountains, 1,500 metres (4,921 ft) above sea level, it was one of the episcopal cities of the ancient Patriarchate of Antioch.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nNotable people\nSee also\nDamascus Document\nList of World Heritage in Danger\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAbdulkarim, Maamoun (2003).

          "summary": "Damascus is the capital and largest city of Syria. It is the oldest capital city in the world. Known colloquially in Syria as aš-Šām and dubbed, poetically, the \"City of Jasmine\" (مَدِيْنَةُ الْيَاسْمِينِ Madīnat al-Yāsmīn), Damascus is a major cultural center of the Levant and the Arab world.\nSituated in southwestern Syria, Damascus is the center of a large metropolitan area. Nestled among the eastern foothills of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean on a plateau 680 metres (2,230 ft) above sea level, Damascus experiences an arid climate because of the rain shadow effect. The Barada River flows through Damascus.\nDamascus is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. First settled in the 3rd millennium BC, it was chosen as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate from 661 to 750. After the victory of the Abbasid dynasty, the seat of Islamic power was moved to Baghdad. According to some, Damascus is the fourth holiest city in Islam. The city saw its importance decline throughout the Abbasid era, only to regain significant importance in the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods.\nToday, it is the seat of the central government of Syria. Damascus was named the least livable city out of 140 global cities in the Global Liveability Ranking. As of June 2023, it was the least livable out of 173 global cities in the same Global Liveability Ranking. In 2017, two new development projects were launched in Damascus to build new residential districts, Marota City and Basillia City to symbolize post-war reconstruction.",

          "content": "دِمَشْق هي عاصمه الجمهوريه العربيه السوريه، ومركز محافظه دمشق. وهي احدى اقدم مدن العالم مع تاريخ غير منقطع منذ احد عشر الف عام تقريبًا، واقدم مدينه - عاصمه في العالم. اصبحت عاصمه منطقه سوريا منذ عام 635.\nهناك عده نظريات في شرح معنى اسم دمشق، اوفرها انتشارًا كون اللفظه ساميه قديمه بمعنى الارض المسقيه؛ يعود ذلك لموقع المدينه الجغرافي في سهل خصيب يرويه نهر بردى وفروعه العديده، مشكلاً بذلك غوطه دمشق؛ وايضًا يتميز موقع المدينه بوجود جبل قاسيون فيها. اقتصرت تسميه دمشق على المدينه القديمه حتى القرون الوسطى، حين اخذت المدينه بالتوسّع خارجها، حاليًا تتالف دمشق من خمسه عشر منطقه سكنيه متصله بمحيطها من الضواحي لتشكل ما يعرف باسم دمشق الكبرى.\nالمدينه تعدّ المركز الاداري لمحافظه دمشق، بينما تتبع معظم الضواحي اداريًا لمحافظه ريف دمشق. حسب احصاءات عام 2013 فان عدد سكان دمشق بلغ 1.9 مليون نسمه، لتكون بذلك ثاني اكبر المدن السوريه بعد حلب، بينما يبلغ عدد سكان دمشق الكبرى (حسب احصاء 2010) 4.4 مليون نسمه، لتكون بذلك اكبر تجمع سكاني في سوريا، وبر الشام، وضمن اكبر عشر مدن في الوطن العربي بعد القاهره، وبغداد والرياض؛ وتبلغ مساحه المدينه 105 كم2؛ غالبيه سكان دمشق التقليديه هم من عرب سوريا على صعيد العرق، ومن المسلمين السنه على صعيد الدين. عبر التاريخ، سكنت دمشق جماعات صغيره العدد، من اصول اوروبيه - بلقانيه بشكل اساسي - وعربيه، بدواع مختلفه، انسجم اغلبها بمرور الوقت مع نسيج المدينه؛ تحوي دمشق ايضًا اعدادًا كبيره من المواطنين المنحدرين من سائر المدن والمحافظات السوريه، كمقيمين دائمين فيها. بوصفها العاصمه، فان دمشق مقر جميع الوزرات والمقرات الهامه في الدوله السوريه، بما فيها البرلمان، والمحكمه الدستوريه العليا.\nمنذ العصور القديمه، اشتهرت دمشق بوصفها مدينه تجاريه، تقصدها القوافل للراحه او التبضع، كانت المدينه احدى محطات طريق الحرير، وطريق البحر، وموكب الحج الشامي، والقوافل المتجهه الى فارس او اسيا الصغرى او مصر او الجزيره العربيه. هذا الدور الاقتصادي البارز لعب دورًا في اغناء المدينه وتحويلها الى مقصد ثقافي وسياسي ايضًا، فالمدينه كانت خلال تاريخها مركزًا لعدد من الدول اهمها الدوله الامويه - اكبر دوله اسلاميه من حيث المساحه في التاريخ، وفيها اقامت ودفنت شخصيات بارزه في تاريخ الشرق مثل صلاح الدين الايوبي والظاهر بيبرس. اما حاليًا، فيقوم اقتصاد دمشق على التجاره، والصناعه المنتشره في الضواحي، والسياحه، وقد اعتبرت دمشق عام 2010 واحده من افضل المقاصد السياحيه في العالم، الا انّ الازمه السوريه المندلعه منذ 2011، افضت الى تراجع كبير في اقتصاد المدينه، وبروز ازمات اجتماعيه واقتصاديه فيها. اعتبارًا من سبتمبر 2019،\nاي بعد مرور ما يُقارب ثماني سنوات على الحرب الاهليه، تم تصنيف دمشق على انها المدينه الاقل ملاءمهً للعيش في العالم، من قبل وحده الاستخبارات الاقتصاديه. صنفت دمشق في عام 2022 اسوا مدينه في العالم من حيث العيش.\nتُعرف ايضًا باسماء عديده منها الشام و مدينه الياسمين؛ وقد احتلت مكانه اقليميه بارزه على صعيد الفنون، والاداب، والسياسه؛ وحظيت باهتمام الادباء والشعراء والرحاله ونظم في وصفها العديد من النصوص الشعريّه والادبيّه، نذكر منهم ياقوت الحموي الذي كتب:\n\nويقول نزار قباني:\n\nاصل التسميه\nمن اقدم الوثائق التي ذكرت فيها دمشق على مرِّ التاريخ رُقم مدينه ايبلا العائده الى حوالي عام 2000 ق.م، اذ وردَ ذكرها تحتَ مُسمَّى داماسكي. كما ان ذكرها جاءَ اكثرَ من مرَّه في النصوص المصريَّه القديمه، ومن ابرزها الواح تحتمس الثالث العائده الى القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، حيثُ ذكرت باسم تيمساك، وفي رسائل تل العمارنه باسم تيماشكي. وفي الفترات التي تبعت ذلك تعاقبت عده اسماء عليها مع كل دوله جديده كانت تحكم المنطقه، فاطلق عليها الاشوريون دَمَشْقا واحياناً استخدموا اسم ايميري شو ايضًا، والاراميون كانوا يُطلقون عليها اسم ديماشقو، كما ورد اسمي دارميساك او دارميسيق في بعض النصوص الاراميه الذي قد يَعني «الدَّار/الارض المسقيه» او «المكان الوافر بالمياه» او «ارض الحجر الكلسي». ومنه في العصور الانتيكيه، عرف في اللغه اللاتينيه، ومنها اللغات الاوروبيه المعاصره ببعض التحريف في النطق ليُصبح داماسْكُس (باللاتينيه: Damascus).\nبعد الفتح الاسلامي للشام عُرفت المدينه بالكثير من الاسماء، منها دمشق الشام تمييزاً لها عن مدينه غرناطه في الاندلس التي سُميت ايضاً دمشق العرب، وذاتَ العِماد لكثره الاعمده في ابنيتها، وباب الكعبه لوُجودها على طريق مكه، والفَيْحَاء لاتساعها ورائحتها الزكيه، بالاضافه الى عده اسماء والقاب اخرى منها جِلَّق وحصن الشام وفسطاط المسلمين. كما تُسمَّى ايضاً الشام، على طريقه تسميه الفرع باسم الاصل. يُوجد خلاف كبيرٌ وافتراضات عديده بشان اصل اسم دمشق نفسه وطريقه اشتقاقه في العربيه؛ فانصار الجذر العربي للاسم يرونه ناجمًا عن مصطلح دَمْشَقَ في العربيه القديمه اي «اذا اسرع»، ولذلك يُقال ان المدينه سُميت باسمها لان «ابناءها دَمْشَقوا – اي اسرعوا – في بنائها». اما غالب المؤرخين الذين اعادوا اللفظه لكونها سريانيه، او لاتينيه، لا العربيه، فيرون انه اشتق من كلمه دُومَسْكَس بمعنى المسك او الرائحه الطيِّبه، فيما يَرى اخرون انها سُمِّيت تيمناً بالقائد اليونانيّ دماس الذي اسَّسَ المدينه، ونظراً الى ذكر المدينه في رسائل تل العمارنه والكرنك في مصر باللغه الهيروغليفيِّه تحتَ مُسمَّى دِمَشْقُوا ودَمْشَقَا؛ كما ساد الاعتقاد بان الكلمه مشتقه من اسم احد احفاد النبي نوح دَمَاشِق.\nفي الايام الراهنه، تعرف دمشق في اللهجه السوريه باسم الشام؛ اما اكثر القابها شهره فهي، مدينه الياسمين، وجلّق، والفيحاء، الى جانب عدد من الالقاب الاقل انتشارًا مثل دره الشرق، شامه الدنيا، شام شريف والتي كانت منتشره بشكل رسمي خلال سوريا العثمانيه، كنانه الله، الدار المسقيه.\n\nالتاريخ\nما قبل العصر البرونزي\nبحسب عمليات التنقيب والبحث التي تركزت في الغوطه ووادي نهر بردى فان منطقه دمشق ماهوله بالبشر منذ ما يقارب 10,000 عام اي خلال مرحله الصيد والانتقال، وقد عثر اضافه لاثار الانسان العاقل على اثار لانسان نياندرتال، وابرز ما اثر عن تلك الحقبه فؤوس ومقاحف حجريه وغيرها من الادوات اليدويه، غير ان الفتره الممتده من انقراض انسان نياندرتال قبل 40,000 عام وحتى 30,000 عام تلبث شديده الغموض في تاريخ دمشق، وكذلك في تاريخ سائر الشرق الاوسط عمومًا، ثم تعود الاثار البشريه والحضريه للظهور مع دخول العصر الزراعي قبل 30,000 عام تقريبًا، اذ عثر على العديد من القرى والمستوطنات البدائيه، خصوصًا في منطقه تل الاسود وتل الغريفه،  وقد عُثر في هاتين البقعتين من دمشق على اقدم مخازن الحبوب في العالم وبعض حبيبات من الشعير والقمح المتفحم، اما عن نمط الحياه حينها فقد بنى السكان الاوائل اكواخًا بيضويه صغيره الحجم استخدم في بنائها الطين واللبن والقصب وهي من المواد التي كانت متوفره بكثره في المستنقعات والبحيرات التي كانت تسوّر المدينه، وجفّت مع تتالي الحُقب.\nوبحسب تحليل ماده الكربون 14 فان موقع تل الرماد يرجع تاريخه الى النصف الثاني من الالف السابع قبل الميلاد وربما نحو 6300 قبل الميلاد، وقد شهدت المستوطنه البشريه تطورًا حياتيًا فاستعمل الحجر في بنائها ورصفت شوارعها بالحجاره ايضًا، وعثر في موقع تل الغريقه على اقبيه ومخازن ومواقد للشيْ، وطور السكان نظام سقايه بسيط، كما عثر ايضًا على عدد وافر من عظام الماعز والغنم وغيرها من الحيوانات المدجنه، ورغم عدم تمكن المنقبين من وضع تصور دقيق حول الفن والحياه الاجتماعيه والدين في دمشق خلال تلك الفتره، الا انّ المكتشفات تدلّ على وجود نوع من الفن وحياه اجتماعيه متكامله في كلا الموقعين. مستوطنه تل الغريقه دمرت في الالف الخامس قبل الميلاد، غير انه خلال الفتره نفسها بنيت مستوطنه ثالثه شمال الغوطه، ويشير الباحثون الى ان عددًا من السكان عاد الى التنقل بدلاً من الاستقرار بدليل اثار المنازل الضعيفه الصنع، والتي تشير الى تنقل مستمر بين المناطق، والى وفره عظام الحيوانات، ما يدلّ على امتهان الرعي. كما يشير تحليل الكربون 14 في ولعلّ تطور الحركه العمرانيه في المدينه يبدا من الالف الثاني قبل الميلاد. كانت دمشق جزءًا من مقاطعه امورو القديمه في عهد مملكه الهكسوس، ما بين 1720-1570 قبل الميلاد، وتذكر بعض السجلات المصريه القديمه من رسائل تل العمارنه حوالي 1350 قبل الميلاد، انها كانت تسمى في ذلك العهد ديماسكو، وانها تحت سيطره ملك مصر القديمه بيرياوازا. حوالي عام 1260 قبل الميلاد، اصبحت دمشق فضلا عن بقيه البلاد، ساحه معركه بين الحيثيين من الشمال والمصريين من الجنوب، وانتهت المعركه بتوقيع معاهده بين هاتوسيلي الثالث ورمسيس الثاني، والتي سلمت مقاليد السيطره على منطقه دمشق لرمسيس الثاني عام 1259 قبل الميلاد. وحوالي 1200 قبل الميلاد، وصلت شعوب البحر الى دمشق، ما وضع علامه على نهايه العصر البرونزي في المنطقه ودخول العصر الحديدي؛ والذي لم تكن دمشق فيه، في الجزء الطرفي في الصوره، بل اثرت على عدد من المراكز السكانيه في سوريا القديمه.\n\nفي سوريا الاراميه\nيعود ظهور دمشق كمدينه على جانب من الاهميه الى فتره سوريا الاراميه حوالي القرن الثاني عشر قبل الميلاد؛ اذ اسس الاراميون سلسله ممالك متحالفه مع بعضها البعض كانت ارام دمشق المذكوره في الكتاب المقدس احداها؛ ويعود لتلك الفتره اكتساب دمشق لاقدم اشكال اسمها الحالي ديماشقو. انشا الاراميون نظام توزيع للمياه، وبنوا الترع وقنوات الري على اطراف نهر بردى، وهو ما ساهم بازدهار الزراعه وزياده عدد السكان، خصوصًا من ناحيه وفود قبائل ارام زوبه من سهل البقاع المجاور لدمشق، واستقرارهم في المدينه، وهو ما جعل دمشق تابعه لمركزهم في البقاع، حتى القرن العاشر قبل الميلاد، حين تمكّن ايزرون عام 965 قبل الميلاد من الاطاحه بـارام زوبه مؤسسًا الكيان المستقل المعروف بارام دمشق؛ التي بزرت كالقوه المتفوقه في جنوب سوريا الاراميه، وسعت للتوسع واحتكار طرق التجاره مع الشرق، وحاربت مملكه اسرائيل، لاسيّما في عهد بن حدد الاول (880 - 841 قبل الميلاد)، وفي عهد خلفه حزائيل غدت باشان المعروفه اليوم باسم حوران الى مملكته؛ الا ان بن حدد الثاني فشل في حصار السامره ووقع في الاسر، ما اضطره الى فتح المجال التجاري لليهود في دمشق؛ بكل الاحوال فان التهديد الذي شكلته الامبراطوريه الاشوريه كان احد اهم اسباب عقد معاهده السلام بين ارام دمشق ومملكه اسرائيل، لمواجهه الخطر المشترك على كليهما.\nفي عام 853 قبل الميلاد، قام الملك هدادايزر من دمشق بقياده تحالف سوريا الاراميه، وقد شمل هذا التحالف قوات من شمال مملكه حماه، والقوات التي وفرها احاب ملك اسرائيل؛ واحتدم القتال في معركه قرقر ضد الجيش الاشوري، والذي انتهى بانتصار التحالف الارامي. قتل هدادايزر على يد خليفته حزائيل الثاني، وانهار التحالف المعقود مع مملكه اسرائيل، فحاولت ارام دمشق غزوا مملكه اسرائيل مجددًا لكن الغزو الاشوري الثاني افضى لالغاء الخطه. امر حزائيل الثاني بالتراجع الى الجزء المحصن من دمشق، في حين نهب الاشوريون ما تبقى من المملكه، الا انهم فشلوا من دخول مدينه دمشق ذاتها، معلنين سيادتهم على حوران والبقاع. وبحلول القرن الثامن قبل الميلاد، تمكنت الامبراطوريه الاشوريه من الاستيلاء على جميع الممالك الاراميه في سوريا بما فيها دمشق؛ وبالرغم من الاضطرابات السياسيه والثورات التي شهدتها هذه الفتره، الا ان المدينه اشتهرت كمركز تجاري وثقافي في سوريا الاراميه؛ كما ازدهرت كموقع للقوافل التجاريه نحو الشرق والجنوب؛ ولم تضمحل اللغه او الثقافه الاراميه بل انتشرت نحو الاجزاء الشرقيه من الهلال الخصيب؛ وبحلول سنه 605 قبل الميلاد اضمحلت السيطره الاشوريه بعد سقوط نينوى بيد الميديين والبابليين، الذين ورثوا حكم سوريا، التي اضحت او بعض اجزائها على الاقل ومنها دمشق ضمن نطاق سيطره الفرعون نخاو الثاني، لفتره وجيزه، الا ان الامبراطوريه البابليه الثانيه تمكنت من استعادتها بعد فتره قصيره. واصبحت المدينه لاحقا بعد صعود الاخمينيين جزا من امبراطوريتهم.\n\nفي سوريا الانتيكيه\nلحوالي الالف عام وبدءًا من 331 قبل الميلاد، كانت دمشق جزءًا من سوريا الانتيكيه، اساسًا عبر حكمي الدوله السلوقيه ثم ولايه سوريا الرومانيه؛ وخلال بعض الفترات كانت دمشق جزءًا من ممالك الحكم الذاتي السوريه، كدوله الانباط في القرن الاول، ومملكه تدمر في القرن الثالث، ويذكر ان سكان دمشق استنجدوا بالملك النبطي الحارث الثالث عام 84 لحمايتهم من قطاع الطرق، وبذلك بلغت الدوله النبطيه اقصى اتساعها. واكتسبت دمشق وضع مدينه حرّه، وهو ما كان يعفيها من الضرائب ويشجّع فيها التجاره، وشكلت حلف المدن العشر او «الديكابوليس» بدءًا من القرن الاول قبل الميلاد؛ ومنحت في عهد الامبراطور هادريان وضح متروبول اي مدينه كبرى، وان لم تكن مركزًا لولايه حتى عام 400 حين قسّم البيزنطيون البلاد الى اربعه ولايات، والتي كانت دمشق بموجبها عاصمه ولايه فينيقيا الثانيه. ولعلّ اكبر كارثه حلّت بالمدينه، الاجتياح الفارسي عام 614 بقياده كسرى الثاني، والذي انتهى عام 629 حين تمكن هرقل من طرد الفرس في سوريا.\n\nمكثت دمشق سريانيه اللغه والثقافه في العصور الانتيكيه، رغم انتشار اليونانيه فيها لاسيّما في الطبقات العليا، ولم تحلّ لغه الانثقاف مكان اللغه الاصليه كما حصل في مناطق عديده لاسيّما في الساحل، وبرزت من دمشق شخصيات سوريه يونانيه الثقافه على مستوى الامبراطوريه مثل ابولودور؛ وشهدت دمشق في مرحله سوريا الانتيكيه، ازدهارًا عمرانيًا، وتخطيطًا على نمط هيبوداموس وتوسعًا، واحتوت كعواصم العالم الاغريقي، مسارح، وساحات لسباق الخيل، وحمامات، واقواس نصر، ومدافن فخمه، ويعود لتلك الحقبه من تاريخ دمشق، نمو سورها، وابوابها، ويضيف بعض المؤرخين قلعتها. خلال مرحله ما قبل الميلاد، انتشرت عباده الاله الارامي حدد - وهو المقابل لجوبتير الروماني، وزيوس اليوناني، ضمن سياسه توفيق الالهه - في المدينه؛ ووصف بكونه سيّد دمشق، وشيّد على اسمه معبد جوبتير؛ ووجدت في دمشق جماعات ضخمه من يهود سوريا من مرحله قبل الميلاد، وانتشرت فيها المسيحيه منذ قرنها الاول، وحسب سفر اعمال الرسل، فان القديس بولس، تحوّل الى المسيحيه قرب دمشق،اع 9:3] ومنها انطلق في النشاط التبشيري، بعد ان تمّت تدليته في سله من احدى نوافذ السور، اذ اراد الحاكم القاء القبض عليه وقتله.2كو 11:33]\n\nالخلافه الراشده والامويه\nفي سبتمبر 635م فتح خالد بن الوليد دمشق سلمًا بعد سته اشهر من الحصار، ومنح في اثرها الامان لسكانها حسب صكّ التسليم المبرم بينه وبين اسقفها سرجون بن منصور؛ وهو الصك الذي استسلمت بموجبه سائر المدن السوريه؛ وفي العام التالي (13هـ/636م) وقعت معركه اليرموك الحاسمه في تاريخ فتوح الشام. بعد الفتح استقرّ الولاه في دمشق، وبذلك انتقلت عاصمه البلاد من انطاكيه اليها؛ وبعد اربع سنوات من الفتح عيّن معاويه بن ابي سفيان واليًا على دمشق، خلفًا لاخيه يزيد بن ابي سفيان؛ وخلال فتنه مقتل عثمان اعلن معاويه التمرد على الخليفه علي بن ابي طالب، واستقلّ بحكم الشام، وبسط نفوذه في مصر عبر عامله عمرو بن العاص، وبعد خمس سنوات من القتال، انتهت الحرب في عام الجماعه (40هـ) باعلان الدوله الامويه وعاصمتها دمشق؛ وبذلك يكون معاويه قد حكم دمشق اربعين عامًا عشرون منها كوالي، وعشرون اخرى كخليفه.\n\nوخلال «الفتنه الثانيه» والتي كان قائدها في دمشق يزيد بن معاويه، نقل الى دمشق راس الامام الحسين وعدد من نساء اهل البيت منهم السيده زينب؛ كما استقر في دمشق عدد من زوجات النبي، والصحابه، ودفنوا فيها. خلال الصراع بين فروع الاسره الامويه على الحكم وقعت معركه مرج راهط قرب دمشق بين اتباع الامويين واتباع عبد الله بن الزبير، والتي ثبتت البيت المرواني وزعيمه مروان بن الحكم في السلطه؛ وفي اعقاب حكمه لا سيّما ايام ابنه عبد الملك، وحفيديه الوليد وهشام، عاشت دمشق ازهى ايامها، فمع توسع الدوله وتدفق اموال الجبايه على عاصمتها تكاثرت في دمشق القصور والحمامات وغيرها من المباني والمحال العامه، ويروي المؤرخون ان الناس اذا التقوا بعضهم في ايّام الوليد وهشام، كان حديثهم عن العماره، وفنون البناء، ومجمل ما يمكن استنتاجه من خلال مصادر المؤرّخين، ان مدينه دمشق في العهد الاموي كانت تحفل بحلّه جميله بعد ان نعمت بالمركز الممتاز، والخير العميم، والازدهار الاقتصادي، ويحدّث المؤرخون عن احواض المياه والنواعير والسّقايات التي كانت منبّثه على اطراف الشوارع، وعلى ابواب المباني العامّه، وفي الاسواق والسّاحات، وعند ابواب المدينه، ولقد عدّد ابن عساكر عشرين منها كانت باقيه الى عهده يرجع اكثرها الى عصر بني اميّه؛ ولعلّ «دار الاماره» التي شيدها معاويه لتكون مقرًا له والتي سميت ايضًا «الدار الخضراء» نظرًا لقبتها الخضراء، احدى اول وابرز المشاهد العمرانيه الامويّه في المدينه، كما شيّد الامويون مستشفيان كبيران داخل المدينه ودارًا للخيول.\nوبنى الوليد الجامع الاموي واسرف في تزينه بالفسيفساء، وكذلك الحال في حلب، وكان الجامع الاموي مسجد دمشق الوحيد داخل الاسوار الى جانب مصليين صغيرين خارجها، ولم يبن الامويون سواهم. ونتيجه هذا الازدهار استقر حولها على ضفاف نهر بردى عدد من القبائل، وشقّ «نهر يزيد» من نهر بردى لتامين الريّ لمساحه اكبر من الاراضي؛ كما اهتمّ الوليد ايضًا بالطرقات وربط المدن بعضها ببعض لا سيّما بين دمشق والباديه، حيث شيّد الامويون ما يزيد عن عشرين قصرًا للتنزه وممارسه الرياضات المختلفه، وشهدت المدينه بالتزامن مع ذلك نهضه ثقافيّه. وبعد وفاه هشام اصيبت الدوله بالتصدع، وتعاقب عليها ضعاف الخلفاء، واندلعت فيها فتن داميه بين العرب من القيسيه واليمنيه، وخلع البيت الاموي نفسه خليفتين، ونقل مروان بن محمد اخر الامويين، عاصمته الى حران، ولم يتوقف تداعي صرح الدوله في عهده، وبختام العصر الامويّ زال عهد دمشق الذهبي.\n\nالخلافه العباسيه\nتابعت قوات الثوره العباسيه تقدمها في املاك الدوله بعد انتصارها على الامويين في معركه الزاب عام 749م، حتى فرضت حصارًا على دمشق دام شهرًا ونصف الشهر، ثم تمكّن المحاصِرون من نقب السور عند باب الصغير، وفتحت المدينه للعباسيين، الذين ارتكبوا فيها قسطًا وافرًا من عمليات القتل، والنهب، والتدمير، وقد ذكرها مؤرخو تلك الفتره ومنهم المقدسي. وقد اهملت المدينه في العصر العباسي الاول، ولم تول ايه اهميه، وشهدت عده ثورات ضد الولاه العباسيين، منها ثوره عثمان الازدي عام 753، وثوره 850 ضد المتوكل على الله لما مارسه واليها من «استذلال» لاهلها، ثم عام 868 بقياده عيسى بن الشيخ الذي اعلنها دوله مستقله استمرت حتى عام 896، حيث كلف المعتمد على الله اماجور التركي بالقضاء على دوله عيسى بن الشيخ، وهو ما تمّ له فعلاً. كذلك فقد اندلعت فتن وحروب اهليه بين القيسيه واليمانيه داخل المدينه بين 792 - 796، وفي عام 802 ايضًا. ويذكر انّ المتوكل على الله اراد نقل حاضره الخلافه من سامراء الى دمشق، وكتب لواليه فيها بذلك، غير انه لم يمكث فيها سوى شهرين وعاد الى سامراء تحت ضغط رجال دولته الاتراك. ولم يترك العباسيون اثرًا معماريًا هامًا في المدينه باستثناء ما ذهب اليه عدد من المؤرخين بان قبه الخزنه في الجامع الاموي انما بنيت في خلافه محمد المهدي عام 774.\n\nخلال القرن العاشر الذي تميّز بضعف الدوله في بغداد، وانتشار الدويلات المستقله في ارباضها، تتالى على حكم دمشق الطولونيون حتى عام 906، ثم الاخشيديون، وتعرضت المدينه في عهدهم لغارات شنها القرامطه والبيزنطيون؛ وتلا الاخشيد الحمدانيون 968 حين استعادها الاخشيد مجددًا عام 967، وكانت جزءًا من املاك خلفائهم الفاطميين حتى 947، حين استنجد اهل دمشق بالقائد التركي افتكين الذي وصل حمص، فزحف منها الى دمشق للسيطره عليها، وقد وقعت اثنتي عشره معركه بين افتكين والقائد الفاطمي جوهر، كان اخرها معركه الشاغور، التي خرجت بنتيجتها الشام عن حكم الفاطميين؛ الا انهم عادوا بعد فتره قصيره، وساءت ايام الفاطميين احوال المعيشه وهجرها السكان بنتيجه الغلاء، فانخفض عدد قاطنيها بشكل كبير، وقامت ثورات احداث عامي 982 و999، واستمرّ حكم الفاطميين حتى 1075 حين سيطر عليها السلاجقه، بقياده تتش بن الب ارسلان ثم ابنه دقاق؛ اهتم السلاجقه بالناحيه الدينيه في دمشق خصوصًا اثر انتشار المذهب الشيعي في اعقاب سيطره الفاطميين على المدينه، فانشؤوا عددًا من المدارس الدينيه مجانًا، كما اعتنوا ببناء البيمارستانات، وقد تحولت دمشق الى دوله سلجوقيه مستقله بعد انفراط عقد الدوله السلجوقيه الموحده الى مجموعه من الدول المسيطره على المدن الكبرى في الشام.\n\nبعد نجاح الحمله الصليبيه الاولى في تاسيس امارات لها في الساحل الشامي، بلغت حدود مملكه بيت المقدس اطراف دمشق الجنوبيه في الجولان، وتعرضت حوران لغارات عديده من قبلهم، وهو ما هدد امن دمشق واقتصادها، لكون حوران مصدر قمحها؛ وابرمت دمشق السلجوقيه عام 1110 هدنه مع مملكه بيت المقدس، وفي 1129 اتهم السلاجقه الاسماعيليون بالخيانه وقتل 6,000 اسماعيلي من سكان المدينه مع قادتهم؛ وشهد عام 1132 انتقام الاسماعيليه باغتيال تاج الدين البوري، حاكم دمشق السلجوقي؛ واستغلّ صليبيو القدس الوضع مجهزين جيشًا من 60,000 جندي للهجوم على المدينه، فقام تاج الدين بوري بالتحالف مع عماد الدين زنكي بهدف منع تقدم الجيش وهو ما نجح في تحقيقه؛ وفي عام 1148 ضربت الحمله الصليبيه الثانيه حصارًا حول دمشق الا انه باء بالفشل بجهود نور الدين زنكي حاكم حلب، الذي عاد فخلع السلاجقه عام 1154 موحدًا سوريا تحت حكمه؛ وبعد وفاه نور الدين واندثار الدوله الزنكيه، تبعت دمشق حكم صلاح الدين والدوله الايوبيه التي شملت في عهده الشام، ومصر، والحجاز، واليمن؛ الا انه بعد وفاته عام 1193 انقسمت دولته بين الورثه، فكانت دمشق دوله ايوبيه مستقله بين 1193 - 1201، و1218 - 1245، و1250 - 1260. خلال فتره الحروب الصليبيه، اكتسبت دمشق سمعه كبيره لدى الصليبيين، فالحرير والخشب المزخرف والمطعم وغيرها من سلع الرفاهيه انما كانت تنقل عبر دمشق ومنها الى اوروبا.\n\nعهد السلطنه المملوكيه\nاعتبر المماليك الذين حكموا البلاد بدءًا من 1250 دمشق ثاني مدنهم بعد القاهره لموقعها الحربي وغنى اراضيها؛ واعتبروها مركز نيابه بلاد الشام. وتتالت على دمشق في القرن الثالث عشر غزوات المغول المتلاحقه، واشدها «غزوه غازان» التي وقعت في عام 1300، وقد بلغ عدد قتلى سكان المدينه حوالي مائه الف شخص حسب ما نقل عن قدماء المؤرخين، الى جانب احراق مكتباتها واسواقها، غير انهم فشلوا في اقتحام قلعتها لمناعه موقعها وحصانه سورها المزدوج، فخرجوا من المدينه واعيدت الخطبه لسلطان مصر.\n\nوفي عام 1402، قام المغول بحمله ثانيه على دمشق بقياده تيمورلنك، وقد احرقت المدينه بما فيها الجامع الاموي، وسُبي منها بنتيجه الحمله عدد وافر من الصنّاع والحرفيين والعلماء الى سمرقند، فساهموا بنهضتها الثقافيه. وفي عهد السلطان برسباي (1422 - 1438) اصيبت بلاد الشام بدءًا من حلب وانتهاءً بالكرك بوباء مجاعه، حتى مات الناس من الجوع او من الطاعون، ولعلّ عدم ايلاء المماليك للزراعه الاهتمام الكافي من ساهم في انتشاره، ويقول نقولا زياده انه لو لم تكن دمشق غزيره المياه وخصبه الاراضي لما عادت اليها الحياه المزدهره بسرعه ما كان، على ان المماليك لم يهملوا الزراعه فحسب بل الامن ايضًا وباستثناء قلعه دمشق التي يتولى شؤون حراستها حاميه معينه من القاهره، فان احياء دمشق وحاراتها كانت معرضه لغزو البدو وقطاع الطرق، هذا ما دفع اهالي الاحياء لتسليح انفسهم وتنظيم فرق من اهالي الحيْ تتولى الدفاع عن الحي، ثم اصبح لهذه القوى من الامن ذاتي ما يشبه نقابات خاصه؛ كذلك فقد حُصر بال السيوفي منصب شيخ المدينه، يتناقله اعضائها بالوراثه، ومن مهام شيخ المدينه تمثيل الاهالي ومطالبهم امام الوالي، والتوسط لهم في القضايا المختلفه. رغم ذلك فان عدد سكان المدينه كان ينمو باطراد وحينها كان حي الصالحيه اكبرها، اضافه الى ظهور احياء جديده وضواحي على اطرافها، والى جانب النمو الديموغرافي فان نموًا اقتصاديًا شهدته المدينه خلال القرنين الرابع عشر والخامس عشر، وقامت عدد من الاسواق كسوق الدباغين وسوق الخيل وسوق ساروجه الذي كان اكبرها واسرعها نموًا. وقد اهتم المماليك بتاسيس المدارس الشرعيه الاسلاميه ومنها المدرسه الظاهريه التي اشتهرت بزخرفتها، واداروا سته مستشفيات كبيره تعرف باسم «البيمارستان» خلال مده حكمهم، ومنذ القرن الخامس عشر غدت دمشق مركزًا هامًا للصوفيين، وقد برز من المدينه خلال حكم المماليك عدد من الشعراء والمؤرخين والفقهاء وغيرهم.\n\nفي سوريا العثمانيه\nاوليت دمشق اهميه خاصه خلال زمن الدوله العثمانيه ولقبت «بالشام الشريف»؛ وبعد معركه مرج دابق، دخل السلطان سليم الاول دمشق يوم 26 سبتمبر 1516، وكان اول اعماله ترميم الجامع الاموي؛ وقضى السلطان سليم في دمشق فترتين الاولى عام 1516، والثانيه بعد عودته من مصر عام 1517، حيث انفق معظمها في تنظيم الشؤون الاداريه للولايه، وفي عام 1524 ثارت دمشق بقياده واليها جان بردي الغزالي، وانضمت اليها مدن اخرى كحمص وحماه، فسار فرحات باشا والي حلب بامر من سليمان القانوني اليها، فقضى على التمرد قبل امتداده.\nبين العصرين المملوكي والعثماني استمرت الكتابه في مصنفات تربيه الاطفال وتاديبهم، ونذكر من مصنفات تلك الحقبه ابن حجر الهيتمي (974-909هـ/1566 – 1503 م) الذي وضع وهو في مكه مصنفه الشهير\"تحرير المقال في اداب واحكام وفوائد يحتاج اليها مؤدبو الاطفال. ويبين الهيتمي في مؤلفه هذا ما يحتاج اليه مؤدبو الاطفال من المعارف المتصله بالتربيه، ويعرض لاهم المبادئ التربويه التي توجه عمل المؤدبين في دور العلم.\nووقف المؤرخون الدمشقيون اللاحقون (م1546) امام انتشار ظاهره فساد الاخلاق في فتره القرن الذي سبقهم، والتي كانت محل استهجان ورفض ونقد لموقف السلطه السياسيه منها، وبخاصه فيما يتصل بارتكاب الفواحش والجهر بها من شرب الخمر، وممارسه اللواط، وانتشار بنات الهوى في الاسواق.\nويكشف ابن طولون الصالحي (ت:953هـ/1546م) بان لبنات الهوى بيوتاً خاصه بهن؛ اذ يذكر في احداث شهر جمادى الاولى سنه 885هـ/ تموز 1480م انه تم تخريب «..بيوت بنات الخطا بين جامع التوبه وجامع الجديد بعد ان اشتريت القيساريه من ابن الصقر التاجر بمبلغ ثلاثين اشرفيه، ثم انتقلت بنات الخطا الى جوار المدرسه اليونسيه بالشرف الاعلى» \nغير ان اهتمام العثمانيين بالمدينه لم ينقص، فشيّدوا التكيه السليمانيه، ورمموا حي الصالحيه، الذين لا يزالا ماثلين الى اليوم، كاحد منجزات العثمانيين المعماريه المبكره في سوريا، ولم يكن استقرار الولاه من شيم العهد العثماني، وهكذا تعاقب على دمشق في 148 سنه الاولى من حكم العثمانيين فيها ما لا يقلّ عن 138 واليًا ولم يدم منهم في وظيفته مده سنتين الا ثلاثه وثلاثون واليا؛ وبين عامي 1815 و1895 توالى 61 والي بمعدل والي في كل سنه ونصف. وكان الولاه دائمي النزاع مع الولايات المجاوره، فعلى سبيل المثال نشبت الحرب بين والي دمشق ووالي طرابلس الشام بين عامي 1664 و1667.\n\nاصبحت دمشق ميناءً بريًا للقوافل التجاريه بين مختلف مناطق الدوله، وحسب شهاده الرحاله الفرنسي لوران دارفيو في القرن السابع عشر، فان سكّان دمشق يحبون العيش برفاهه واقتناء الاثاث الفاخر، وان منازل المدينه توحي بالعظمه لروعتها، اما فيما يخصّ التجاره فقد كتب درافيو ان دمشق واحده من الاسواق الرئيسيه في الدوله العثمانيه فهي محط القوافل التجاريه القادمه من مكه والهند وبلاد فارس محمّله بمختلف السلع، ومكان لصناعه الاقمشه التي اشتهرت بها المدينه. والى جانب القوافل التجاريّه، فان المدينه والتي كانت نقطه تجمّع لقوافل الحجاج المسلمين، قد اعتمدت على قوافل الحج في تامين الوفره النقديه وتنشيط عمليات البيع والشراء. لسوء الحظ، فان قوافل الحج في اواسط القرن الثامن عشر قد تعرضت لهجمات من قبل البدو او من قبل مقاتلي الحركه الوهابيه وفشل الولاه المتعاقبون في الغالب في تامين الحجيج ولعلّ اكبر الحوادث ما وقع عام 1757 حين نهبت القافله التي كانت تحوي ستين الف حاج بكامل ما تحمل. ونتيجه انعدام الامن خلال تلك المرحله انخفض عدد الحجاج الى نحو الفي حاج فقط ما اثر على اقتصاد دمشق بشكل بالغ السوء.\nفي عام 1724 اسندت ولايه دمشق الى اسماعيل باشا العظم وهو «خير وال عرفته المدينه في العصر العثماني»، وله يعود تشيييد قصر العظم الذي اعتبره فيليب حتي «اروع اثر عربي في القرن الثامن عشر»، وفي عام 1771 دخلت المدينه في حوزه والي عكا ضاهر العمر الا انه اضطر للتنازل عنها سلمًا في العام التالي. وفي عام 1782 غدا احمد باشا الجزار واليًا وكان حكمه قاسيًا اذ اضنك الشعب بالضرائب وضاعف من الاتاوه على التجار، واصيبت دمشق وغوطتها بالقحط والجفاف عام 1793، وحين اعيد تعيينه واليًا عام 1803 اغلق اهل دمشق باب المدينه في وجه مندوبه سليمان باشا، ولذلك فرض عليهم غرامات طائله وصادر املاكهم ومكث واليًا الى ان توفي عام 1804 قبل ان يعود الولاه العثمانيين المتعاقبين على تسيير شؤونها.\n\nوفي فبراير 1831 ثارت دمشق بعد اعلان الوالي ضريبه جديده اعتبرها السكان باهظه، وشكّل اهالي حي الميدان ذي الغالبيه الفقيره نواه المنتفضين، الذين قاموا بمحاصره الوالي وكبار حاشيته في القلعه، ثم اقتحموها قاتلين الوالي وكبار حاشيته، وساحلين جثته جارين اياها من حي الى حي في شوارع دمشق.\nوفي العام نفسه، دخل ابراهيم باشا دمشق سلمًا باسم والده والي مصر محمد علي باشا، وكان حكم ابراهيم باشا في الشام اصلاحيًا من مختلف الجوانب، رغم الفتره القصيره التي مكث بها في السلطه، اذ اضطر للانسحاب بضغط القوى الكبرى العسكري في 17 سبتمبر 1840. في عام 1845 نهب البدو قافله تجار دمشق المتوجهه الى بغداد وكانت مكونه من ثلاثه الاف جمل فافلس تجار المدينه واصبحت طريق التجاره مع بغداد تمرّ بحلب والموصل اي اطول مما كانت عليه بثلاث مرات، وفي عام 1851 طبّق نظام التجنيد الاجباري للمره الاولى بعد سقوط حكم محمد علي مع ما تركه من اثار سلبيه تمثلت بالهجره الداخليّه والخارجيّه على حد سواء وتراجع الاقتصاد وقسمه العائلات للحصول على اعفاء الرجل الوحيد؛ وشهدت دمشق مجازر 1860 التي افضت لقتل الاف المسيحيين؛ على انّ الهزيع الاخير من القرن التاسع عشر كان عهد نهضه، لاسيّما في عهود الولاه المصلحين امثال مدحت باشا، وغدت دمشق خلال تلك الفتره، احدى ميادين النهضه العربيه وتاسست بها صحف ومجلات، وانتشرت المدارس واسست نواه الجامعه السوريه، والجمعيات السياسيه، والمسرح برعايه ابو خليل القباني، وتزايدت الاثار العمرانيه وشقت ساحات المدينه البازره امثال ساحه المرجه فضلاً عن انطلاق سكه حديد الحجاز والاتصال بالتلغراف معها.\n\nدمشق المعاصره\nعانت دمشق خلال الحرب العالميه الاولى من ضنك العيش بنتيجه المجاعه التي اجتاحت البلاد وموجات الهجره، فضلاً عن كونها مقر الجيش العثماني الخامس، وتعسّف الحاكم العسكري جمال باشا السفّاح، الذي اسس ديوانًا للاحكام العرفيه فيها، وبلغ ذروه قرارته باعدام سبعه من وجهاء المدينه في 6 مايو 1916 وهو ما تحوّل الى عيد للشهداء. في 30 سبتمبر 1918 انسحبت القوات العثمانيه والوالي العثماني من دمشق مؤذنًه بانتهاء عصر سوريا العثمانيه. وفي اليوم التالي وصلتها قوات من جيش الثوره العربيه الكبرى، وبعدها بايام فيصل بن الحسين، الذي نصّب في دمشق يوم 8 اذار/مارس 1920 ملكًا على سوريا (التي كانت تعني كامل بلاد الشام) خلال حفل اعلان الاستقلال وانشاء المملكه السوريه العربيه. غير ان عهد الاستقلال لم يستمرّ طويلاً، اذ دخلت القوات الفرنسيه دمشق بعد معركه ميسلون في 24 يوليو 1920، وفي سبتمبر اعلنت دوله دمشق المصغّره ضمن خطه الانتداب الفرنسي لتقسيم سوريا الى دويلات. في عام 1922 نقلت عاصمه البلاد الى حمص ضمن الاتحاد السوري، على ان تبقى دمشق عاصمه اقليم دمشق فقط، وهو ما الغي عام 1925 بعوده دمشق عاصمه الدوله السوريه.\nعام 1925 وصلت الثوره السوريه الكبرى الى دمشق، وتحولت الغوطه الى احدى معاقلها الرئيسيه، ولعلّ ابرز مرحله في تلك الفتره احداث 18 اكتوبر حين استولى الثوار على احياء الميدان والشاغور ووصلوا حتى سوق البزوريه وقصر العظم مقر مندوبي المفوضيّه الفرنسيّه العليا، وطردوا جميع عناصر الشرطه واستطاعوا الاستيلاء على ما فيها من اسلحه، وبلغ التماس ساحه المرجه، الا ان قصف المدينه بالمدفعيه الثقيله من قاسيون اجبر المقتحمين على الانسحاب. في 1936 كانت دمشق شراره الاضراب الستيني، وبعدها انطلقت منها احتجاجات 1939، التي افضت لنزول وحدات الجيش الفرنسي السنغاليه واحتلالها ساحات المدينه. خلال الحرب العالميه الثانيه، نشبت معركه دمشق عام 1941 والتي افضت لسيطره الحلفاء ممثلين بالجيش البريطاني وقوات فرنسا الحره على المدينه. بعد نهايه الحرب العالميه الثانيه، اندلعت من دمشق انتفاضه الاستقلال التي شهدت قصف دمشق للمره الثانيه، ونزول قوات بريطانيه فيها، وبشكل عام ادت الانتفاضه لنيل الجلاء. بعد الاستقلال كانت دمشق مسرحًا لعدد من الانقلابات العسكريه اهمها انقلاب اذار 1949 وانقلاب 1954، الذي انطلق من حلب وادى الى حاله فوضى في دمشق لمده يومين تخللتها عمليات سلب ونهب. وكرد فعل على حرب فلسطين وانشاء اسرائيل، شهدت المدينه عام 1948 احتجاجات ومظاهرات تعرضت خلالها مواقع لليهود في المدينه وعدد من مقار البعثات الدبلوماسيه، بما فيها مقر الامم المتحده، لعمليات نهب واعتداء، وكان اكبر هذه الاعتداءات تفجير كنيس المنشاره. خلال تمرد الاخوان المسلمين في الثمانينات، وقعت في دمشق عده تفجيرات بين 1981 - 1986، واستهدافات بالسيارات المفخخه كان اكبرها تفجير الازبكيه. تاثرت المدينه بالصراع مع اسرائيل، فتعرضت دمشق الكبرى لاستهدافات صهيونيه في ازمنه الحرب، مثل حرب حزيران 1967، وخارج ازمنه الحرب مثل اغتيال عماد مغنيه عام 2008 وقصف مركز البحوث العلميه في جمرايا مرتين في 2013.\nتطورت المدينه على صعيد الخدمات والتخطيط العمراني وزادت المرافق العامه وغدت اكثر حداثه، وبرزت المشاريع المعماريه الضخمه فيها؛ كما افضت الهجره من الريف الى المدينه والنزوح من الجولان وفلسطين الى نشوء ضواحٍ سكنيه ملحقه بدمشق مثل مخيم اليرموك والحجر الاسود.\n\nالثوره السوريه\nاندلعت الازمه السوريه في مارس 2011، وشهدت دمشق احتجاجات سلميه لمدَّه سنه كامله، قابلها النظام بعنف مفرط، ممَّا انشا انواع مختلفه من الاحتجاجات المعارضه، التي تحولت الى نزاع مسلح مع النظام؛ في 6 يناير 2012 انفجرت اول سياره مفخخه في دمشق ما اسفر عن مقتل 26 شخصًا؛ وتكررت عمليات الاستهداف فيما بعد ولعلّ عمليه بركان دمشق وزلزال سوريا، التي استهدفت قيادات بارزه في النظام، اهم عمليه تفجير داخل المدينه. ايضًا، فان المعارك الحربيه، احتدمت في مناطق ريف دمشق، عازلهً المدينه عن اجزاء واسعه من ريفها، وعن بعض ضواحيها، وافضت لحركه نزوح واسعه الى المدينه؛ وبشكل عام تكررت الاشتباكات والمعارك في ريف دمشق وبعض ضواحي المدينه نفسها كمخيم اليرموك، وكذلك الاستهدافات بالسيارات المفخخه، وبقذائف الهاون والصواريخ، ما بعد مرحله تحول الازمه الى صيغه العسكره الكامله؛ في حين عانت المدينه من الغلاء، وانقطاع الطرق، وانتشار الحواجز الامنيه بشكل كثيف اضافه الى نزوح الالاف من المناطق المحيطه بدمشق الى المناطق الامنه.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالتشكل الجيولوجي\nبدا تشكل المنطقه التي تحتلها دمشق حاليًا منذ العصر الطباشيري، وتشير المعلومات المتوافره انه مع بدايه الزمن الرابع كانت تغطي المنطقه بحيره واسعه امتدت من الكسوه حتى الضمير، وكانت شواطئها اعلى من شواطئ بحيره العتيبه الحاليه بحوالي 125 مترًا، ويقوم نهر بردى ونهر الاعوج برفدها بالمياه باستمرار اضافه الى الامطار والاوديه الفرعيه والانهار الموسميه الاخرى، ما ادى الى قيام مناخ بارد وماطر وانتشار غابات كثيفه. منذ حوالي 500,000 سنه حصل جفاف نسبي في المناخ فتراجعت مياه البحيره حتى بلغ ارتفاعها 15 مترًا فقط، وادى تراجعها الى تشكل تربه غوطه دمشق ومنطقه التربه السوداء الخصبتين نتيجه جمله نشاطات سيليه حتيه، ولم يبق من هذه البحيره سوى بحيره العتيبه حاليًا، مع العلم انه قبل حوالي 10,000 سنه حصل جفاف مناخي اخر ادى الى تراجع مستوى ما تبقى من البحيره لحدود 6 امتار فقط.\n\nالموقع\nدمشق مدينه داخليه تبعد حوالي 80كم عن البحر الابيض المتوسط قباله سلسله جبال لبنان الشرقيه، وتقع على هضبه بارتفاع 690م عن سطح البحر، وتبعد عنها بيروت 85 كم الى الغرب، وكل من عمان 180 كم والقدس 220 كم الى الجنوب. وقد نوّه الجغرافيون والرحاله لحسن موقعها منذ القديم، حيث ان المياه المتوفره بكثره من الانهار والينابيع والتربه الخصبه والمناخ المعتدل، ساهمت في عمران المدينه وازدهارها؛ ومما قاله فيها ابن حوقل: «هي اجمل مدينه من مدن الشام تقع في ارض مستويه.» تمتد المدينه من السفح الجنوبي لجبل قاسيون نحو الشرق الى الباديه وتحيط بها الغوطه من جميع الجهات، فهي قائمه في وسط الغوطه. كانت البساتين الخصبه سبب وجود دمشق الاساسي وغناها عبر العصور، مرتويه من فروع نهري بردى في الشمال، والاعوج في الجنوب، وكلاهما شديدي التشعب في سواقٍ تغطي المدينه والغوطه ايضًا. يتغذى كلا النهرين من ذوبان ثلوج سلسله لبنان الشرقيه، لاسيّما جبل الشيخ، الذي اكتسب اسمه لكونه مجللاً دومًا بالثلج الابيض. يشكل جبل الشيخ ايضًا، مع سلسلته الجبليه، النهايه والحد لسهول دمشق الخصبه من ناحيه الغرب. اما الجبل المحيط بالمدينه بحد ذاتها من ناحيه الغرب ايضًا ليشكل «اسوره دمشق» فهو جبل قاسيون، الذي تبلغ اعلى قممه 1170 م فوق سطح البحر، ويعدّ احد مراكز المدينه السياحيه الهامه.\nتبلغ مساحه المدينه 105 كم2 بما فيها العمران المنتشر على جبل قاسيون، اما من دون احتساب العمران المنتشر على الجبل فتبلغ مساحتها 77 كم2.\n\nالاحياء والمناطق\nتعدّ المدينه القديمه اساس دمشق التاريخي، وهو ذات سور وعشره ابواب تاريخيه، وينصّفها الشارع الشارع المستقيم على نسق العماره الرومانيه، وتحوي عددًا من المعالم البارزه مثل القلعه، والجامع الاموي، وقصر العظم، وقصر الخضراء، وعدد من الاسواق التقليديه؛ والكثير من النمط العماري المعروف باسم البيوت العربيه، وتعدّ من اهم معالم سوريا السياحيه، وهي مدرجه على لائحه التراث العالمي منذ 1979. خارج المدينه القديمه، بدات الاحياء بالنشوء منذ القرن الثالث عشر مع ساروجه، والشاغور، والميدان، وتابعت نموّها حتى القسم الثاني من القرن العشرين، فزحف العمران نحو سفوح قاسيون وبساتين الغوطه؛ في المحصله فانّ بلدات مستقله عن دمشق باتت تعدّ جزءًا من المدينه، مثل برزه، وجوبر، والمزه، فضلاً عن الانشاءات السكنيه الحديثه مثل مشروع دمر، وكفر سوسه؛ في الاونه الراهنه تقسّم دمشق الى 15 منطقه، تقسم هذه الاحياء بدورها الى 95 حيًا، اما تاريخيًا فحتى بدايه القرن العشرين كان التقسيم التقليدي لدمشق، يجعلها في ثمانيه اثمان. بكل الاحوال، وبنتيجه توّسع المدينه، فهي ملتصقه بضواحيها، التي تتبع اداريًا محافظه ريف دمشق، بعض هذه التوسعات انشاءات حديثه مثل جرمانا واشرفيه صحنايا، والبعض الاخر بلدات تاريخيه مثل عربين، ودوما؛ يذكر ان عدد من اهالي دمشق انتقل من المدينه الى الضواحي، لكون تكلفه الحياه واسعار العقارات فيها اقل، ومن الشائع - كما في عدد كبير من مناطق العالم - ان يكون مكان استقرار الافراد في المدينه، بينما مركز عملهم في الضواحي، او العكس. وخلال الازمه السوريه افضت المعارك والقصف، الى دمار واسع في عدد كبير من هذه الضواحي، فضلاً عن هجره معظم سكانها لداخل مدينه دمشق او مناطق سوريه اخرى.\n\nالمناخ\nمناخ دمشق يتميز بكونه قاريًا جافًا الى شبه جاف، اذ ان قمم سلسله جبال لبنان الشرقيه تمنع تاثيرات البحر المتوسط من الوصول الى المدينه، وسوى ذلك فان انفتاحها من ناحيه الشرق والجنوب الشرقي على باديه الشام يجعلها عرضه لتاثيرات مناخيه من الباديه. اما درجات الحراره فيبلغ مدى تغيرها خلال العام 18 درجه مئويه، تتجاوز خلال فصل الصيف الاربعين وتنخفض في فصل الشتاء لحوالي سبع درجات، وفي بعض الاوقات لما دون الصفر ما يؤدي الى اصابه المزروعات بالصقيع فضلاً عن تساقط الثلوج. وعموما لا يتجاوز معدل الهطول المطري السنوي في دمشق بين 200 ملم، وهي غير منتظمه السقوط ما يجعل الاعتماد عليها في الزراعه امرًا صعبًا، غير ان الروافد المائيه وعلى راسها نهر بردى يغني عن ذلك. اما الرياح التي تهبّ على دمشق فلها نوعان الرياح الغربيه والجنوبيه الغربيه التي تكون محمله بدرجات عاليه من الرطوبه، والرياح الشرقيه القادمه من الباديه التي تهبّ عاده في فصل الصيف مسببه ارتفاعًا في درجات الحراره وعاده ما تكون محمله بالغبار.\n\nالسكان\nيَبلغ عدد سكان دمشق وريفها مُجتمعين وفقَ احصاء عام 2010 حوالي 4.4 ملايين نسمه، مُوزعين كـ1,724 الف نسمه في محافظه دمشق و2,701 الف نسمه في محافظه ريف دمشق، و50% من هؤلاء ذكور في دمشق فيما ان نسبتهم تصل الى حوالي 52% في ريفها، وبذلك يكون عدد سكان دمشق الكبرى اكبر تجمّع بشري في سوريا، ويقطنه حوالي 19.5% من الشعب، كما تعدّ المدينه بذلك اكبر مدن بلاد الشام، والرابعه في الوطن العربي. اما على صعيد مدينه دمشق الاداريه دون ضواحيها، فانها تحتل المرتبه الثانيه في سوريا بعد مدينه حلب، وبفارق ضئيل عن مدينه حمص، وهي المدن المليونيه الثلاث في سوريا.\nكان مجموع سكان المدينه وريفها قد بلغ حسب احصاء 2004 حوالي 4 ملايين نسمه، منهم 1.5 مليون في المدينه و2.5 في الريف. واما في احصاء 2007 فكان مجموع عدد السكان في المُحافظتين 4.15 ملايين نسمه، حيث احتلَّت ريف دمشق المرتبه الثانيه بعد حلب بـ2,487,000 نسمه تليها دمشق في المرتبه الثالثه بـ1,669,000 نسمه، واما حمص فكانت لا تزال في المرتبه الرَّابعه انذاك بفارق 22 الف نسمه عن دمشق. وفيما يخصُّ المستقبل يُتوقع ان يَصل عدد سكان دمشق وحدها بحلول عام 2025 الى اكثر من 5.6 ملايين نسمه، واما ريفها فسيَبلغ عدد سكانه 4.6 ملايين نسمه، لكن 80% من الزحف العمراني سيكون باتجاه الريف، وستزداد نسبه الاحياء العشوائيه في محيط المدينه. لا يُمكن الحصول على احصائيات دقيقه للتعداد التاريخي لسكان دمشق، وعُموماً يُوجد الكثير من التضارب في الاحصائيات المسجَّله. مع تحسُّن الامن والخدمات الصحيه وتوفر الغذاء في فتره النصف الثاني من القرن التاسع عشر والنصف الاول من القرن العشرين، بدا ازدياد مضطرب في نمو السكان بالنسبه الى المعدًّلات التاريخيه، حيث تضاعف المعدل مرَّات خلال العقود الاخيره. حسب اخر احصاء سكاني عام 2010، بلغ عدد سكان المدينه وريفها 4.4 ملايين نسمه.\n\nيَتالف التركيب العرقيُّ لسكان دمشق بشكل اساسي من عرب سوريا الذين يمثلون حوالي 95% من اجمالي السكان، ويَليهم الاكراد بنسبه 4%، وبالاضافه الى هؤلاء تُوجد اقليَّات اخرى من الارمن والسريان والتركمان والشركس والاذريين والبشناق والالبان وهم من وفدوا اليها خلال العهد العثماني، تمثل معاً الـ1% المتبقيه. الغالبيه العُظمى من السكان هي من المسلمين الذي يمثلون 93% من سكان المدينه، تاريخيًا من السُّنَّه، مع هجره حديثه للمدينه او ضواحيها من سائر الطوائف. بشكل مميز تعدّ ضاحيه الست زينب في الجنوب وحي شارع الامين ذات اقليه شيعيه اثني عشريه معتبره، وضاحيه حرستا (ضاحيه الاسد سابقًا) وعش الوروار في الشمال، ذات غالبيه علويه. يشكل المسيحيون حوالي 7% من سكان دمشق، وهم يتبعون اساسًا بطريركيه انطاكيه وسائر المشرق للروم الارثوذكس وبطريركيه الروم الكاثوليك. بقي في دمشق عدد ضئيل من اليهود، اذ انخفضت اعدادهم بشكل كبير خلال النصف الثاني من القرن العشرين.\nعدد الطلاب في دمشق وريفها كبير وهذا يجعل المدينه من «المدن الفتيّه». بلغ عدد المتقدمين في دمشق لامتحانات شهاده التعليم الاساسي والشهاده الثانويّه بمختلف فروعها 64,262 طالبا مقابل 42,994 طالبا في ريفها. تبلغ نسبه الاميّه في المدينه حسب احصاءات عام 2001 نحو 5.2% من السكان فقط وهي رابع محافظه سوريه من حيث القضاء على الاميه، رغم ذلك فان 33.3% من السكان اي ثلث دمشق حاصلون على التعليم الابتدائي فقط، وطبق الاحصاءات نفسها فان 6.6% من السكان فقط حاصلون على شهاده جامعيّه؛ علمًا بان دمشق تحقق افضل النتائج في البلاد من هذه الناحيه. اغلب الطبقات الاميّه والقليله التعليم هي متقدمه في العُمر بينما تنال اغلب الاجيال الجديده تعليمًا كاملاً، في حين تبلغ نسبه التسرّب الدراسي 7% من مجموع الطلاب فقط.\n\nالاداره\nحسب الماده الخامسه من دستور سوريا فان دمشق عاصمه البلاد، وهي بالتالي مقر الحكومه المركزيه والهيئات السياديه في الدوله، كالرئاسه، والحكومه، والبرلمان، وايضًا مقر البعثات الدبلوماسيه، واول قنصليه دبلوماسيه افتتحت في دمشق هي قنصليه الكرسي الرسولي عام 1762؛ وتقع غالب مقرات البعثات الاجنبيه في مناطق المالكي والمزّه. من ناحيه اداريه، فان دمشق هي محافظه سوريه، وهي اصغر المحافظات الاربع عشر من حيث المساحه، والوحيده التي فصل عنها الريف ومدن الضواحي، لتشكل محافظه اخرى هي محافظه ريف دمشق، ويقع مقرها في حرستا. طبقًا للقانون السوري، يعيّن رئيس الجمهوريه المحافظ ويعفيه من منصبه، في حين يقوم ناخبي المحافظه بانتخاب مجلس مدينه لمتابعه تنفيذ القضايا الاداريه اليوميه فيها. تقوم فروع دمشق من الهلال الاحمر السوري، والدفاع المدني السوري، والشرطه السوريه، بمهام الاسعاف، والاطفاء، والطوارئ، واداره المرور، وحفظ الامن الداخلي في المدينه؛ ويكون للضواحي فروعها الخاصه التابعه لمحافظه ريف دمشق. في مجلس الشعب السوري، تمثل دمشق منذ 1990 بعدد 29 نائبًا، وهو اعلى من حقها في التوزيع في حال توزيع النواب تناسبيًا لاعداد الناخبين بعشره مقاعد، كما تعدّ دائره انتخابيه واحده؛ تقليديًا فان دمشق تنتخب الحزب الوطني خلال مرحله الجمهوريه الاولى، عدا انتخابات 1961 حين حصل الاخوان المسلمون 4 مقاعد مقابل 3 للحزب الوطني ومستقلين لسائر المقاعد، وهي اخر انتخابات تعدديه جرت في سوريا، اما جميع الانتخابات اللاحقه خلال عهد الجمهوريه الثانيه كانت لمرشحي الجبهه الوطنيه التقدميه.\n\nالاقتصاد\nتقليديًا فان دمشق مدينه تجاريه، ورغم تغيّر طبيعه طرق التجاريه من القوافل التقليديه الى الوسائل الحديثه، فان دور المدينه كسوق استهلاكيه وانتاجيه هامه في سوريا، ومصدره لمنتجاتها للخارج لاسيّما دول مجلس التعاون لدول الخليج العربيه لم يتوقف. منذ 1954 يقام سنويًا معرض دمشق الدولي وقد شاركت به عام 2009 ثمانيه واربعين دوله، ويعدّ اقدم معرض يقام في الشرق الاوسط، الى جانب عدد من المعارض التخصصيه الاقل اهميه. وفي عام 2012 تم وضع اول ميزانيه ماليه لمحافظه دمشق، حيث وضعت ميزانيه قدرها 25 مليار ليره سوريه (حوالي نصف مليار دولار). خُصِّص 10% من الميزانيه للمشاريع الطارئه، وتركز الباقي على مشاريع التنميه والخدمات العامه، كشق الطرقات وبناء الجسور وحفر الانفاق. في عام 2009 افتتح سوق دمشق للاوراق الماليه، بوصفه الاول والوحيد في سوريا. كما تحتوي دمشق على عده نشاطات صناعيه، فالى جانب الصناعات التقليديه، مثل الحلويات الدمشقيه، والسيف الدمشقي، والتطعيم بالخزف، والمنسوجات اليدويه بانواعها، والتي تراجع دورها واهميتها في العصور الحديثه، فان ضواحي دمشق تحوي عددًا من المدن الصناعيه مثل مدينه حوش بلاس الصناعيه ومدينه عدرا، وتحوي مصانع عامّه وخاصه، بشكل خاص لصناعه المواد الغذائيه المعتمد على انتاج الغوطه الزراعي والحيواني، ومواد البناء، والملابس والمنسوجات، والعطور، وبعض الصناعات الثقيله. اما بالنسبه لسوق العقارات في دمشق فهو مزدهر، وحسب تقرير اعده مستشاري المؤسسه العقاريه كوشمان ويكفيلد اند، والذي افاد ان دمشق تعدّ ثامن اغلى مناطق العالم من حيث سعر المتر المربع في عام 2009.\n\nرغم ان قطاع السياحه قد دمّر بالكامل بنتيجه الازمه السوريه، فانّ دمشق تعدّ مدينه سياحيه بامتياز، ووضعت حسب بعض التصنيفات ضمن قائمه المواقع السياحيه الاكثر اهميه في العالم؛ وقد قدّر عدد السيّاح الاجانب في سوريا عام 2010 بنحو 6 ملايين سائح، لتحتل بذلك المرتبه الثالثه في النمو السياحي. نتيجه ذلك، فان دمشق تحوي جميع عناصر الصناعه السياحيه، كالفنادق، وبشكل خاص البيوت العربيه التقليديه التي تحولت الى فنادق في المدينه القديمه، والفنادق الحديثه مثل فندق الفورسيزون وفندق الشام، فضلاً عن المطاعم ومن اشهرها بوابه دمشق، وصالات الرقص والترفيه، والمكاتب السياحيه لتنظيم الرحلات الى المواقع المختلفه.\n\nخدمات\nالاعلام\nمنذ تاسيسهما اواسط القرن العشرين، فان دمشق مقر الاذاعه والتلفزيون السوري الرسمي، وكذلك الصحف الوطنيّه الثلاث صحيفه تشرين، وصحيفه الثوره، والبعث؛ خلال الفتره الممتده بين 1963 - 2004 كانت الدوله السوريه تحتكر وسائل الاعلام، خارج هذه الفتره وجدت ومنذ 1878 وجدت في دمشق منابر اعلاميه خاصه لاسيّما الصحف والمجلات، حاليًا يوجد اكثر من 60 صحيفه ومجله تصدر في دمشق. تعدّ دمشق ايضًا مقرًا للعديد من الاذاعات والتلفزات الخاصه، مع مكاتب اعلاميه دائمه لعدد من القنوات الاقليميه او الدوليه؛ فضلاً عن كونها مقر وكاله الانباء الرسميه سانا.\n\nالتعليم\nعام 2005 كانت دمشق تحوي 426 مدرسه حكوميّه ابتدائيّه و81 مدرسه حكوميّه ثانويّه و47 مدرسه حكوميّه مهنيّه، في حين يحوي ريفها 937 مدرسه ابتدائيّه و130 مدرسه ثانويه و81 مدرسه مهنيّه، كانت الدوله السوريّه ومنذ العام 1963 تحتكر القطاع التعليمي بكامل مفاصله، ففي عام 2004 سُمح لقطاع الخاص بالاستثمار في السلك التعليمي وشهدت العاصمه تاسيس عدد وافر من المدارس الخاصه الوطنيه امثال «واحه الشام» او فروع لمدارس في المنطقه العربيه امثال «مدرسه الشويفات»، على ان الطبقات الثريّه في المجتمع وحدها من تتجه نحو المدارس الخاصه بسبب اقساطها المرتفعه وغير المتلائمه مع متوسط دخل المواطن. في عام 1913، انشئت اول جامعه بالمفهوم المعاصر في دمشق وهي «مدرسه الحقوق» التي انشئت اواخر العهد العثماني، وشكلت نواه «الجامعه السوريّه» التي انشات في عهد صبحي بركات عام 1923، وحوّل اسمها لاحقًا الى جامعه دمشق، وهي مداره من قبل الحكومه السوريّه ويبلغ عدد الكليات التابعه لها 16 كليه و11 معهد عالي؛ ويبلغ عدد الطلاب فيها 115,256 طالب بموجب احصاءات العام 2007؛ الى جانب التعليم الحكومي الشبه مجاني بهذه الصيغه، هناك التعليم الموازي والتعليم المفتوح في جامعه دمشق؛ هناك ايضًا الجامعه الافتراضيه السوريه، والمعهد العالي لاداره الاعمال والمعهد العالي للعلوم التطبيقيه والتكنولوجيا، بعد السماح للقطاع الخاص الاستثمار في حقل التعليم العالي انتشرت في ضواحي دمشق عدد من الجامعات الخاصه امثال الجامعه السوريه الخاصه والجامعه العربيه الدوليه والجامعه الدوليه للعلوم والتكنولوجيا.\n\nالرياضه\nيتوفر في مدينه دمشق منشات رياضيه لعده رياضات شعبيه مثل كره القدم، وكره السله، والسباحه، والتنس، وتنس الطاوله والفروسيه والشطرنج. وقد برز الاهتمام بالمنشات الرياضيه في اعقاب استضافه المدينه لاحداث رياضيه هامه منها دوره الالعاب العربيه الخامسه والسابعه بين عامي 1976 و1992 على التوالي، ومهرجان الشباب العربي عام 1981، الى جانب العديد من الفعاليات الاخرى الاصغر حجمًا. كما تعدّ دمشق موطن لكثير من الانديه العريقه التي تنشط في الدوري الممتاز السوري لكره القدم، هي نادي الجيش، ونادي الوحده، ونادي المجد. تحوي دمشق مدينه الفيحاء الرياضيه التي تضم ملعبًا لكره القدم وصالات مغلقه لكره اليد والسله والطائره ونوادي ومنشات للجودو ورفع الاثقال والجمباز وملاعب تنس ومسابح. كما يوجد ايضًا ثلاث منشات رياضيه كبيره في المدينه هي ملاعب تشرين والجلاء والعباسيين، ويوجد ايضا ميدان للفروسيه واخر للرمايه في صحنايا على مقربه من دمشق.\n\nالصحه\nتحوي دمشق 43 مشفى خاص، وثلاثه مشافي كبيره تديرها الحكومه اهمها مشفى تشرين، ومشفى المواساه الجامعي؛ تدير الحكومه ايضًا عددًا من المراكز الصحيه موزعين على قطاعات دمشق الخمسه عشر، تقدم نحو 2.5 مليون خدمه طبيه سنويه حسب الارقام الرسميه. تقليديًا، فانّ البيمارستانات كانت مشافي دمشق التاريخيه، واهمها البيمارستان النوري.\n\nمعالم\nاسواق\nتحوي مدينه دمشق نمطًا تقليديًا من الاسواق المسقوفه، داخل الاسوار وخارجها، ابرز اسواق دمشق المسقوفه اربع: سوق الحميديه، وسوق مدحت باشا، والبزوريه، والحريقه، فضلاً عن وجود الاسواق التخصصيه مثل سوق الصاغه المتخصص ببيع المجوهرات والمصاغ؛ بشكل عام يمكن احصاء خمسين سوقًا تقليديًا متنوع الاستخدامات في مدينه دمشق؛ وتشكل فضلاً عن كونها ذات اهميه تراثيه واثريه كبيره، احد شرايين المدينه الاقتصاديه حتى وقتنا الراهن. ويلاحظ بشكل خاص في سوريا العثمانيه ازدهار «الخانات»، وهي بناء مربع من طابقين في وسطه ساحه مكشوفه يستخدم في الدور الاسفل كمستودع للبضائع والمعاملات التجاريه وفي الدور الاعلى كمنامه للتجار، على ان اغلب الخانات تحولت لمتاحف، وابرزها خان اسعد باشا. الاشكال الحديثه من الاسواق، يمكن تقسيمها الى فئتين: الشوارع التي تكثر فيها المحلات التجاريه مثل شارع الشعلان، وشارع الحمراء، ويعدّ البعض منطقه ابو رمانه بوصفها الوسط التجاري لدمشق الحديثه؛ والمراكز التجاريه الكبيره، وتحوي دمشق عددًا كبيرًا منها مثل: مالكي بلازا مول، شام سيتي سنتر، قاسيون مول، والاب تاون.\n\nحدائق واضرحه ونصب\nتقليديًا يعدّ جبل قاسيون الفسحه الرئيسيه لسكان دمشق، الى جانب الجبل فانّ مدينه دمشق تحوي 172 حديقه عامه تديرها محافظه دمشق، و790 حديقه خاصه ملحقه بالمنازل؛ تبلغ المساحه التقريبيه لحدائق دمشق 1.4 مليون كليومتر مربع، اهم حدائق دمشق العامه واكبرها حديقه تشرين، وحديقه السبكي، وحديقه التجاره. ابرز النصب العامه في مدينه دمشق، نصب الجندي المجهول في جبل قاسيون؛ ونصب ساحه المرجه التاريخي الذي اقيم لمناسبه ربط المدينه بالتغراف، ونصب السيف الدمشقي في ساحه الامويين، والذي غدا «رمزًا من رموز مدينه دمشق المعماريه»؛ ونصب صلاح الدين الايوبي مقابل سور القلعه؛ كما يترفع نصب يوسف العظمه في وسط ساحه المحافظه، شاهرًا سيفه.\nتحوي دمشق 33 مقبره عامه، ابرزها مقبره باب الصغير ومقبره الدحداح والتي تحوي قبورًا لشخصيات تاريخيه عديده؛ في المقبرتين المذكورتين تصل كلفه القبر لحوالي 500.000 ليره سوريه وغالبًا ما تتوارثه العائله؛ غلاء اسعار القبور في دمشق دفع شرائح من السكان لدفن موتاها في الضواحي، على سبيل المثال في حرستا لا تتجاوز تكلفه القبر 20.000 ليره سوريه. اما ابرز الاضرحه، فسوى ضريح يوحنا المعمدان - يحيى - في الجامع الاموي، وضريح الست زينب في الضاحيه المعروفه بالاسم في جنوب دمشق؛ فان دمشق تحوي اكثر من 65 ضريحًا الّفت حولها كتب مثل كتاب مشيدات دمشق ذوات الاضرحه؛ هذه الاضرحه تتنوع لشخصيات دينيه مثل ام سلمه وحفصه بنت عمر بن الخطاب من امهات المؤمنين، وصحابه مثل بلال الحبشي ودحيه الكلبي، وامراء مثل نور الدين زنكي، وصلاح الدين الايوبي، والظاهر بيبرس، وفلاسفه وعلماء مثل محي الدين بن عربي والفارابي، واخيرًا شخصيات سياسيه معاصره مثل شكري القوتلي.\n\nدور الثقافه\nتاسس المسرح في دمشق على يد ابو خليل القباني في القرن التاسع عشر، ويعدّ اول مسرح عربي حديث؛ في الايام الراهنه تحوي دمشق 25 مسرحًا تديرها وزاره الثقافه او الجهات الخاصه موزعه على 151 دار، ابرز مسارح دمشق دار اوبرا دمشق في ساحه الامويين. اول دور السينما في دمشق تاسس عام 1916 حاليًا تحوي دمشق 36 دار للسينما بعضها لا زال في الخدمه منذ تلك الفتره؛ وتحوي دمشق ايضًا تسعه متاحف سوريه، ابرزها المتحف الوطني الذي يحوي اثارًا من مختلف المحافظات السوريه، فضلاً عن متحف دمشق التاريخي المؤسس لتوثيق الحياه في مدينه دمشق عبر القرون، الى جانب المتاحف التخصصيه، مثل متحف الخط العربي، والمتحف الحربي السوري، وغيرهما من متاحف المدينه السبعه. على صعيد المكتبات العامه، فانّ المكتبه الظاهريه تعدّ من اكبر مكتبات الشرق من حيث المخطوطات القديمه والمؤلفات المحفوظه بها، والمكتبه الوطنيه السوريه التي افتتحت عام 1984 لتكون دارًا عامه للكتب في المدينه. الى جانب المراكز الثقافيه الوطنيه، تحوي دمشق عددًا من المراكز الثقافيه الاجنبيه الملحقه بالبعثات الدبلوماسيه، وتحوي الضواحي في مجمل محافظه ريف دمشق على 132 مركزًا ثقافيًا تابعًا لوزاره الثقافه.\n\nدور العباده\nتحوي دمشق على حوالي 200 مسجد، و36 كنيسه، و10 كنس يهوديه، لم يبق في الخدمه حاليًا منها سوى اثنان وبشكل غير متصل.\nويعدّ الجامع الاموي، اشهر مساجد دمشق، ومعالمها الدينيه اجمالاً، واعتبره البعض رابع المساجد شهره في الاسلام، تاركًا اثاره المعماريه على عدد من الابنيه الاخرى داخل وخارج سوريا. كما مساجد بارزه اخرى ذات انماط ايوبيه - مملوكيه، او عثمانيه نذكر منها على المثال التكيه السليمانيه، وهناك ايضًا المساجد الحديثه؛ ويمكن تصنيف مساجد دمشق بثلاث تصنيفات المساجد باصلها، والمساجد التي انشات كمدارس، والمساجد التي انشات كاضرحه. وتعدّ المدينه مقرًا دائمًا لثلاثه صروح بطريركيه انطاكيه ابرزها الكنيسه المريميه، وكنيسه الزيتون، وتوجد الى جانب هذه الكنائس الاثريه كنائس حديثه النمط المعماري مثل كنيسه الصليب في القصاع. الى جانب دور العباده، فان الجهات المديره لهذه الاماكن، تدير عددًا من المؤسسات المتصله بها مثل مجمع الدراسات الاسلاميه.\n\nنمط العماره\nالاسلوب المعماري التقليدي في دمشق، هو ما يعرف في سوريا باسم البيت العربي وهو الاساس المعماري في المدينه القديمه، التي تتميز بالشوارع المرصوفه بالحجاره، والازقه الضيقه، والاسراف في الزخرفه والتطعيم. منذ اواخر القرن التاسع عشر وبدايه القرن العشرين، تطور اسلوب العماره في دمشق، وانفتح على اساليب متعدده فرضتها تدخلات المعماريين الاجانب في عماره بعض المنشات العامه ثم تسربت اتجاهات العماره الاوروبيه الشائعه بواسطه المعماريين المحليين الذين درسوا في الغرب؛ وفي عام 1936 وضع اول مخطط تنظيمي شامل لمدينه دمشق على يد المعماري الفرنسي دانجييه عام 1936، والذي اهتم بصوره خاصه بتخطيط الشوارع الرئيسيه وانشاء الساحات الكبيره الدائريّه، وفي عام 1963 قام المعماري الفرنسي ميشيل ايكوشار بتخطيط عمراني جديد لدمشق ساهم في توسعها نحو الجبال والشمال بشكل كبير، وقد صدرت عده مخططات تنظيميه اخرى كان اخرها عام 2010، ركز هذا التخطيط الاخير على الضواحي والتوسعات.\nويمكن ملاحظه انواع معماريه مختلفه في المدينه، مكتب عنبر على سبيل المثال يتبع نمط المحلي مضافًا اليه العماره الباروكيه، بينما محطه حديد الحجاز تتبع النمط الكلاسيكي الجديد مع طغيان العناصر المحليه في الزخرفه والتطعيم وجميع التفاصيل البناء الداخليه، وكذلك حال مبنى البرلمان، اما حي الصالحيه يغلب عليه الطراز المتوسطي مثل مدرسه الفيحاء، في حين ان الطراز الكولونيالي يمكن ان تصنف ضمنه عده ابنيه منها مبنى العابد. الطراز الاوروبي التقليدي الذي ساد في القرن التاسع عشر وبدايات القرن العشرين، يصنّف ضمنه عدد كبير من ابنيه دمشق التي بنيت في تلك الفتره، ابرزها فندق الشرق؛ ويعود للطراز المعماري الحديث كل من مبنى المكتبه الوطنيه السوريه، ومبنى دار اوبرا دمشق، والبنك المركزي.\n\nطرق النقل والساحات\nتنظم حركه النقل والمواصلات في دمشق، عدد من المحاور والطرق السريعه والعاديه، المزوده بالجسور والانفاق، ابرزها المتحلق الجنوبي، الذي يمرّ فوق مدينه دمشق رابطًا اياها بالريف، ومنتهيًا في شارع شكري القوتلي وسط المدينه؛ ويمتدّ المتحلق الشمالي بطول 37 كم، الذي يتصل مع الضواحي في الهامه مارًا فوق وادي بردى، وينتهي في حي الميدان. كذلك فان ساحه الامويين، وساحه العباسيين، تعدّان ابرز ساحتين في قلب المدينه واكبرهما، وتقوم عقده قصر الشعب وجسر المهاجرين المقام الاساسي في عقد المواصلات للقسم الغربي من المدينه، وعقده القابون اساس قسمها الشرقي؛ وتقليديًا في ساحه المرجه تعدّ ساحه وسط مدينه دمشق. اما الطرق السريعه لخارج دمشق الكبرى، فاقدمها واهمها طريق بيروت الشام، الذي يصلّ دمشق ايضًا بالمناطق الغربيه من ريفها كالزبداني؛ والطريق الثاني هو طريق الاردن، الذي يربط دمشق بالمحافظات الجنوبيه حتى عمان، والطريق الثالث شمالاً نحو حمص وحلب؛ وهناك ايضًا طريق تدمر وطريق المطار، بالاتجاه الشرقي من دمشق.\n\nبين 1903 - 1962 كان ترام دمشق يستخدم داخل المدينه؛ اما سكك الحديد في دمشق بدات عام 1895 بربط دمشق ببيروت، عبر عده محطات على الطريق، وانشا عام 1900 الخط الحديدي الحجازي لربط المدينه بجنوبها حتى المدينه المنوره، وبشمالها حتى حلب واسطنبول، الا انه متوقف منذ الحرب العالميه الاولى، ومستبدل باخر محلي يربط دمشق بحمص ومنها الى سائر المحافظات الشماليه والغربيه؛ كشفت الحكومه السوريّه مؤخرًا عن مشروع ربط المدن القريبه في ريف دمشق بالمدينه عن طريق سكك الحديد ايضًا، في حين تنفذ حاليًا مشروعًا لربط المدينه بسكك الحديد مع درعا والقنيطره. وفي عام 2008، اعلنت الحكومه عن خطه لبناء مترو دمشق مع وقت افتتاح الخط الاخضر، ومن المقرر افتتاح المرحله الاولى منه عام 2015، والمرحله الرابعه والاخيره عام 2050. اما المطار الرئيسي منذ 1975 هو مطار دمشق الدولي، على بعد 20 كيلومتر من مركز المدينه، وولجه 5.5 مليون مسافر خلال عام 2010 بزياده تقدر 50% عما كان عليه عدد الوالجين خلال عام 2004؛ قبل مطار دمشق كان مطار المزه يعدّ بوابه دمشق الجويّه، وحوّل للاستعمال العسكري بعد افتتاح مطار دمشق.\nالنقل العام يتم من خلال سيارات الاجره او الحافلات الصغيره التي تربط ضواحي المدينه بعضها ببعض، ويبلغ عدد مجمل الخطوط 100 خط يصل بعضها الى قلب المدينه، وبعضها الاخر الى الضواحي، مع تفوق لسيارات الاجره. تواجه دمشق في السنوات الاخيره ازمه مروريه متزايده، حيث تسجَّل فيها 250 سياره جديده كل يوم، وهناك 40 عقده مروريه بها بحاجه الى حل، ويقدر اجمالي النقص في الحافلات العامه بمقدار 1,800 الى 2,200 حافله للنقل العام لتلبيه احتياجات المدينه، فضلاً عن غياب المرائب التارضيّه. وتعدّ سرعه السيارات في دمشق، مراقبه عبر هيئه مرور دمشق، التي وزعت ضوابط للعدادات وكاميرات مراقبه في شوارع المدينه.\n\nالثقافه\nثقافه اهل دمشق تعدّ جزءًا من الثقافه السوريه بشكل عام، مؤثره ومتاثره بها، فبينما تعدّ دمشق اصل العراضه الشاميه، ورقصه السيف والترس التي انتقلت الى المدن الاخرى، فانّ الانماط التقليديه للغناء، واغاني دمشق التراثيه التي يعود تاليف اشهرها لابي خليل القباني، وفدت من ناحيه النمط والاسلوب من حلب. من عادات دمشق شبه المندثره، اقامه الاحتفالات الخاصه لمناسبات الولاده، او الختان، ويتم تقليديًا في عمر سبع سنوات؛ والاحتفالات التي تقام في الحمامات العامه، وحضور الحكواتي والكركوزاتي او مسرح خيال الظل؛ وقد فصّل عدد كبير من المؤرخين انواع الاحتفالات التي تقام في دمشق، ومجالس اللهو والطرب التقليديه منها الاصفهاني في كتاب الاغاني، من ناحيه المطبخ السوري في دمشق، فللمدينه بعض اصناف من الاطباق تختصّ بها وحدها مثل حراء باصبعو، كما تعدّ السيارين او السياحه في بساتين الغوطه او جبل قاسيون، احد عناصر ثقافه دمشق، والتي حسب ما ذكره المؤرخون، ذات اصول معينه، ففي سبع سبوت في العام تتم في الغوطه، وفي خمسه اخمسه في العام تتم في قاسيون، الى جانب الاحتفال ببدا فصل الربيع او النوروز من عموم اهل دمشق. اللهجه السوريه السائده في دمشق ذات الف مثقله اكثر من باقي المدن والمناطق وهو ما يميّزها؛ في الدراما السوريه، ومع مسلسل ايام شاميه عام 1992 برز نمط جديد يعرف باسم مسلسلات البيئه الشاميه، والذي يوّثق الحياه اليوميه لاهل دمشق من مختلف الصعد والجوانب في مرحله سوريا العثمانيه، او بدايات الانتداب الفرنسي، يذكر انّ مسلسل باب الحاره حقق في جزءه الثاني جماهيريه شعبيّه في الوطن العربي دفعت صحيفه الواشنطن بوست لاعتباره احد الاعمال التلفزيونيه العشره الاكثر متابعه حول العالم. رغم ذلك، فانّ هذه الطائفه من الدراما استقطبت انتقادات واسعه وذهب عدد متزايد من النقاد لاعتبارها لا تنقل واقع دمشق شكل امين بل بشكل مشوّه. وقد انشات القريه الشاميه، كمنطقه تحاكي دمشق في تلك المرحله. في عام 2008 تم اختيار دمشق عاصمه للثقافه العربيه، واقيمت العديد من الفعاليات والنشاطات ضمن الاحتفالات، وصدرت العديد من الاعمال التوثيقيه حول دمشق للمناسبه.\n\nفي الشعر والادب\nمن شعرها في وصف دمشقعائشه الباعونيه[من ]\n\nعبر التاريخ، وصفت دمشق ومدحت في العديد من الاداب العالميه من قبل الرحاله، والشعراء، والروائيين، بعضهم اجانب مثل الرحاله الفرنسي لامارتين، والبعض الاخر عرب. مدح دمشق في الادب العربي يعود لما قبل الاسلام حتى، وقد مدح حسان بن ثابت دمشق ببضع ابيات؛ اما ابرز من مدح دمشق في الادب القديم، فيذكر البحتري، وابي تمام في الشعر، وابن جبير والمقدسي في ادب الرحلات، كما وضعت مؤلفات مستقله في وصف دمشق مثل كتاب «النجوم الزاهره في اخبار دمشق والقاهره»، وكتاب «نزهه الانام في محاسن الشام» للبدري. حديثًا، ومنذ النهضه العربيه في القرن التاسع عشر، فان معظم شعراء العرب البارزين، من سوريين وغير سوريين، قد كتبوا عن دمشق، منهم احمد شوقي، محمود درويش، سعيد عقل، عمر ابو ريشه، نزار قباني، بشاره الخوري وسواهم. هذه الاعمال جمعت في ديوان دمشق الذي اطلق لمناسبه احتفاليه دمشق عاصمه الثقافه العربيه؛ والبعض منها، تحولت الى اغاني مثل قصيدتي شام يا ذا السيف وقرات مجدك لسعيد عقل وقد غنتهما فيروز، والقصيده الدمشقيه لنزار قباني وقد غنتها اصاله نصري.\n\nمدن شقيقه\nالمدن الشقيقه لدمشق هي:\n\nمعرض الصور\nانظر ايضًا\nالجدول الزمني لتاريخ دمشق.\n\nالمراجع\nكتب\nمواقع خارجيه\n\nموقع محافظه

          "summary": "دِمَشْق هي عاصمة الجمهورية العربية السورية، ومركز محافظة دمشق. وهي إحدى أقدم مدن العالم مع تاريخ غير منقطع منذ أحد عشر ألف عام تقريبًا، وأقدم مدينة - عاصمة في العالم. أصبحت عاصمة منطقة سوريا منذ عام 635.\nهناك عدة نظريات في شرح معنى اسم دمشق، أوفرها انتشارًا كون اللفظة سامية قديمة بمعنى الأرض المسقية؛ يعود ذلك لموقع المدينة الجغرافي في سهل خصيب يرويه نهر بردى وفروعه العديدة، مشكلاً بذلك غوطة دمشق؛ وأيضًا يتميز موقع المدينة بوجود جبل قاسيون فيها. اقتصرت تسمية دمشق على المدينة القديمة حتى القرون الوسطى، حين أخذت المدينة بالتوسّع خارجها، حاليًا تتألف دمشق من خمسة عشر منطقة سكنية متصلة بمحيطها من الضواحي لتشكل ما يعرف باسم دمشق الكبرى.\nالمدينة تعدّ المركز الإداري لمحافظة دمشق، بينما تتبع معظم الضواحي إداريًا لمحافظة ريف دمشق. حسب إحصاءات عام 2013 فإن عدد سكان دمشق بلغ 1.9 مليون نسمة، لتكون بذلك ثاني أكبر المدن السورية بعد حلب، بينما يبلغ عدد سكان دمشق الكبرى (حسب إحصاء 2010) 4.4 مليون نسمة، لتكون بذلك أكبر تجمع سكاني في سوريا، وبر الشام، وضمن أكبر عشر مدن في الوطن العربي بعد القاهرة، وبغداد والرياض؛ وتبلغ مساحة المدينة 105 كم2؛ غالبية سكان دمشق التقليدية هم من عرب سوريا على صعيد العرق، ومن المسلمين السنة على صعيد الدين. عبر التاريخ، سكنت دمشق جماعات صغيرة العدد، من أصول أوروبية - بلقانية بشكل أساسي - وعربية، بدواع مختلفة، انسجم أغلبها بمرور الوقت مع نسيج المدينة؛ تحوي دمشق أيضًا أعدادًا كبيرة من المواطنين المنحدرين من سائر المدن والمحافظات السورية، كمقيمين دائمين فيها. بوصفها العاصمة، فإن دمشق مقر جميع الوزرات والمقرات الهامة في الدولة السورية، بما فيها البرلمان، والمحكمة الدستورية العليا.\nمنذ العصور القديمة، اشتهرت دمشق بوصفها مدينة تجارية، تقصدها القوافل للراحة أو التبضع، كانت المدينة إحدى محطات طريق الحرير، وطريق البحر، وموكب الحج الشامي، والقوافل المتجهة إلى فارس أو آسيا الصغرى أو مصر أو الجزيرة العربية. هذا الدور الاقتصادي البارز لعب دورًا في إغناء المدينة وتحويلها إلى مقصد ثقافي وسياسي أيضًا، فالمدينة كانت خلال تاريخها مركزًا لعدد من الدول أهمها الدولة الأموية - أكبر دولة إسلامية من حيث المساحة في التاريخ، وفيها أقامت ودفنت شخصيات بارزة في تاريخ الشرق مثل صلاح الدين الأيوبي والظاهر بيبرس. أما حاليًا، فيقوم اقتصاد دمشق على التجارة، والصناعة المنتشرة في الضواحي، والسياحة، وقد اعتبرت دمشق عام 2010 واحدة من أفضل المقاصد السياحية في العالم، إلا أنّ الأزمة السورية المندلعة منذ 2011، أفضت إلى تراجع كبير في اقتصاد المدينة، وبروز أزمات اجتماعية واقتصادية فيها. اعتبارًا من سبتمبر 2019،\nأي بعد مرور ما يُقارب ثماني سنوات على الحرب الأهلية، تم تصنيف دمشق على أنها المدينة الأقل ملاءمةً للعيش في العالم، من قبل وحدة الاستخبارات الاقتصادية. صنفت دمشق في عام 2022 أسوأ مدينة في العالم من حيث العيش.\nتُعرف أيضًا بأسماء عديدة منها الشام و مدينة الياسمين؛ وقد احتلت مكانة إقليمية بارزة على صعيد الفنون، والآداب، والسياسة؛ وحظيت باهتمام الأدباء والشعراء والرحالة ونظم في وصفها العديد من النصوص الشعريّة والأدبيّة، نذكر منهم ياقوت الحموي الذي كتب:\n\nويقول نزار قباني:",

          "content": "The old city of Damascus (Arabic: دِمَشْق ٱلْقَدِيمَة, romanized: Dimašq al-Qadīmah) is the historic city centre of Damascus, Syria. The old city, which is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, contains numerous archaeological sites, including some historical churches and mosques. Many cultures have left their mark, especially Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine and Islamic. In 1979, the historical center of the city, surrounded by walls of Roman era, was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In June 2013, UNESCO included all Syrian sites on the list of World Heritage in Danger to warn of the risks to which they are exposed because of the Syrian Civil War. Within it lies the monumental Umayyad mosque, one of the largest and oldest mosques in the world.\n\nOrigins and founding\nLying on the south bank of Barada River, the ancient city was founded in the 3rd millennium B.C. The horizontal diameter of the oval is about 1.5 km (0.93 mi) which is known as Damascus Straight Street, while the vertical diameter (Latin: Cardus Maximus) is about 1 km (0.62 mi). With an approximate area of 86.12 hectares (212.8 acres; 0.8612 square kilometres), the ancient city was enclosed within a historic wall of 4.5 km (2.8 mi) in circuit that was mainly built by the Romans, then fortified by the Ayyubids and Mamluks.\n\nThe first mentioning of Damascus was as \"Ta-ms-qu\" in the second millennium BC, it was situated in an Amorite region in the middle of a conflict zone between the Hittites and Egyptians. The city was tributary to these powers until the emergence of the Sea Peoples in 1200 BC whose raids helped in weakening the arch rivals. Consequently, the Semitic Arameans managed to establish the independent state of Aram-Damascus (11th century – 733 BC), naming the main city as ‘Dimashqu’ or ‘Darmeseq’.\n\nHistorical timeline\nThroughout its history, Damascus has been part of the following states:\n\nMain sights\nDamascus has a wealth of historical sites dating back to many different periods of the city's history. Since the city has been built up with every passing occupation, it has become almost impossible to excavate all the ruins of Damascus that lie up to 2.4 m (8 ft) below the modern level. The Citadel of Damascus is located in the northwest corner of the Old City. The Damascus Straight Street (referred to in the conversion of St. Paul in Acts 9:11), also known as the Via Recta, was the decumanus (east–west main street) of Roman Damascus, and extended for over 1,500 m (4,900 ft). Today, it consists of the street of Bab Sharqi and the Souk Medhat Pasha, a covered market. The Bab Sharqi street is filled with small shops and leads to the old Christian quarter of Bab Tuma (St. Thomas's Gate). Medhat Pasha Souq is also a main market in Damascus and was named after Midhat Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Syria who renovated the Souk. At the end of the Bab Sharqi street, one reaches the House of Ananias, an underground chapel that was the cellar of Ananias's house. The Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus, is one of the largest mosques in the world and also one of the oldest sites of continuous prayer since the rise of Islam. A shrine in the mosque is said to contain the body of St. John the Baptist. The mausoleum where Saladin was buried is located in the gardens just outside the mosque.

The Damascene baths were mentioned by a number of Damascus historians, such as Ibn 'Asakir (1106–1175 AD) in his famous book \"The History of Damascus\". In his book, Ibn 'Asakir named 77 of baths working at that time within the city. The historian Ibn Shaddad counted 114 baths located in Damascus in 1250 AD.\nThe number of these baths increased to 365 during the Ottoman era, then decreased drastically to reach 60 baths in the late nineteenth century AD.

In March 2007, the local government announced that it would be demolishing Old City buildings along a 1,400 m (4,600 ft) stretch of rampart walls as part of a redevelopment scheme. These factors resulted in the Old City being placed by the World Monuments Fund on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world.\n\nCurrent state of old Damascus\nIn spite of the recommendations of the UNESCO World Heritage Center:\n\nSouq al-Atiq, a protected buffer zone, was destroyed in three days in November 2006;\nKing Faysal Street, a traditional hand-craft region in a protected buffer zone near the walls of Old Damascus between the Citadel and Bab Touma, is threatened by a proposed motorway.\nIn 2007, the Old City of Damascus and notably the district of Bab Tuma have been recognized by The World Monument Fund as one of the most endangered sites in the world.\nIn October 2010, Global Heritage Fund named Damascus one of 12 cultural heritage sites most \"on the verge\" of irreparable loss and destruction.\nThe old city outside of the walls of the Roman era, is also considered part of the old Damascus, however, it hasn't been given the same historical priority. During the French mandate, Michel Écochard, the French architect, planned an urban scheme for the city, that advised to only reserve the parts of the old city inside the Roman walls. This approach has been adopted later by the ruling governments of Syria, which contributed to demolishing parts of its old neighborhoods. Old houses in Sarouja, Al Midan, and Shagour Barrani was replaced by new buildings for trade mainly.\n\nSee also\nTourism in Syria\nTimeline of Damascus history\nList of rulers of Damascus\nWorld Heritage Sites in Danger\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBurns, Ross (2005).

          "content": "The Umayyad Mosque (Arabic: ٱلْجَامِع ٱلْأُمَوِي‎, romanized: al-Jāmiʿ al-Umawī), also known as the Great Mosque of Damascus (Arabic: جَامِع بَنِي أُمَيَّة ٱلْكَبِيْر‎, romanized: Jāmiʿ Banī Umayyah al-Kabīr), located in the old city of Damascus, the capital of Syria, is one of the largest and oldest mosques in the world. Its religious importance stems from the eschatological reports concerning the mosque and historic events associated with it. Christian and Muslim tradition alike consider it the burial place of John the Baptist's head, a tradition originating in the 6th century. Two shrines inside the premises commemorate the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grandson Husayn ibn Ali, whose martyrdom is frequently compared to that of John the Baptist. It is considered to be the oldest mosque still in use in its original form.\nThe site has been used as a house of worship since the Iron Age, when the Arameans built on it a temple dedicated to their god of rain, Hadad. It was later associated with the Greek god Zeus during the Hellenistic period. Under Roman rule after 64 CE, it was converted into the center of the imperial cult of Jupiter, the Roman god of rain, becoming one of the largest temples in Syria. The current walls of the mosque were the inner walls of the Temple of Jupiter (built in the 1st century BC to 4th century AD). When the empire in Syria transitioned to Christian Byzantine rule, Emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395) transformed it into a cathedral and the seat of the second-highest-ranking bishop in the Patriarchate of Antioch.\nAfter the Muslim conquest of Damascus in 634, part of the cathedral was designated as a small prayer house (musalla) for the Muslim conquerors. As the Muslim community grew, the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715) confiscated the rest of the cathedral for Muslim use, returning to the Christians other properties in the city as compensation. The structure was largely demolished and a grand congregational mosque complex was built in its place. The new structure was built over nine years by thousands of laborers and artisans from across the Islamic and Byzantine empires at considerable expense and was funded by the war booty of Umayyad conquests and taxes on the Arab troops of Damascus. Unlike the simpler mosques of the time, the Umayyad Mosque had a large basilical plan with three parallel aisles and a perpendicular central nave leading from the mosque's entrance to the world's second concave mihrab (prayer niche). The mosque was noted for its rich compositions of marble paneling and its extensive gold mosaics of vegetal motifs, covering some 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft), likely the largest in the world. \nUnder Abbasid rule (750–860), new structures were added, including the Dome of the Treasury and the Minaret of the Bride, while the Mamluks (1260–1516) undertook major restoration efforts and added the Minaret of Qaytbay. The Umayyad Mosque innovated and influenced nascent Islamic architecture by introducing a more organized and monumental design compared to earlier mosques. It enjoyed great prestige throughout its history and was regarded as a \"wonder of the world\" by many medieval Muslim writers. Although the original structure has been altered several times due to fire, war damage, and repairs, it is one of the few mosques to maintain the same form and architectural features of its 8th-century construction, as well as its Umayyad character.\n\nHistory\nPre-Islamic period\nThe site of the Umayyad Mosque is attested as a place of worship since the Iron Age. Damascus was the capital of the Aramaean state Aram-Damascus and a large temple was dedicated to Hadad-Ramman, the god of thunderstorms and rain, and was erected at the site of the present-day mosque. One stone remains from the Aramaean temple, dated to the rule of King Hazael, and is currently on display in the National Museum of Damascus.\nThe Temple of Hadad-Ramman continued to serve a central role in the city afterwards. Under the rule of the Seleucids in the Hellenistic period, probably in the 2nd century BC, the temple was formally dedicated to the Greek god Zeus, who was assmilated to Haddad-Ramman. After the Roman Empire conquered Damascus in 64 BC, they introduced worship of the equivalent Roman god, Jupiter. Thus, they engaged in a project to reconfigure and expand the temple, probably beginning in the reign of Augustus (r. 27 BC – 14 AD). The later Damascus-born architect Apollodorus may have been involved in the design.\nThe new Temple of Jupiter became the center of the imperial cult of Jupiter and was served as a response to the Second Temple in Jerusalem. The Temple of Jupiter would attain further additions during the early Roman period, some funded by contributions from individuals. The temple was further renovated and embellished during the reign of Septimius Severus (r. 193–211). The remains of the western propylaeum visible today most likely date from his tme. By the 4th century, the temple was especially renowned for its size and beauty. It was separated from the city by two sets of walls. The first, outer wall spanned a wide area that included a market, and the second inner wall surrounded the actual sanctuary of Jupiter. It was the largest temple in Roman Syria.\nIn 391, the Temple of Jupiter was converted into a cathedral by the Christian emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395). The church was likely one of the largest of the time. It served as the seat of the Bishop of Damascus, who ranked second within the Patriarchate of Antioch after the patriarch himself.\n\nUmayyad construction\nFoundation and construction\nDamascus was captured by Muslim Arab forces led by Khalid ibn al-Walid in 634. In 661, the Islamic Caliphate came under the rule of the Umayyad dynasty, which chose Damascus to be the administrative capital of the Muslim world. The Byzantine cathedral had remained in use by the local Christians, but a prayer room (musalla) for Muslims was constructed on the southeastern part of the building. The musalla did not have the capacity to house the rapidly growing number of Muslim worshippers in Damascus. The city otherwise lacked sufficient free space for a large congregational mosque. The sixth Umayyad caliph, al-Walid I (r. 705–715), resolved to construct such a mosque on the site of the cathedral in 706.\nAl-Walid personally supervised the project and had most of the cathedral, including the musalla, demolished. The construction of the mosque completely altered the layout of the building, though it preserved the outer walls of the temenos (sanctuary or inner enclosure) of the Roman-era temple. While the church (and the temples before it) had the main building located at the centre of the rectangular enclosure, the mosque's prayer hall is placed against its south wall. The architect recycled the columns and arcades of the church, dismantling and repositioning them in the new structure. Besides its use as a large congregational mosque for the Damascenes, the new house of worship was meant as a tribute to the city. \nIn response to Christian protest at the move, al-Walid ordered all the other confiscated churches in the city to be returned to the Christians as compensation. The mosque was completed in 711, or in 715, shortly after al-Walid's death, by his successor, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 715–717). According to 10th-century Persian historian Ibn al-Faqih, somewhere between 600,000 and 1,000,000 gold dinars were spent on the project. The historian Khalid Yahya Blankinship notes that the field army of Damascus, numbering some 45,000 soldiers, were taxed a quarter of their salaries for nine years to pay for its construction. Coptic craftsmen as well as Persian, Indian, Greek, and Moroccan laborers provided the bulk of the labor force which consisted of 12,000 people. The extravagant costs also attracted initial resentment among the population and criticism from some Muslim writers.     \nThe mosque subsequently held major religious and cultural significance throughout its history, while also having a strong influence on later Islamic architecture. It was commonly regarded as one of the \"wonders of the world\" by medieval Muslim authors, who praised its architecture and decoration. Some medieval authors even claim that of the five wonders the mosque ranks fourth for its superlative beauty and extraordinary cost while its decoration ranks fifth.\n\nLayout design\nThe plan of the new mosque was innovative and highly influential in the history of early Islamic architecture. The earliest mosques before this had been relatively plain hypostyle structures (a flat-roof hall supported by columns), of which the Prophet's Mosque in Medina was an important model. The new mosque in Damascus introduced a more basilical plan to this model, with three parallel aisles and a perpendicular central nave. The central nave, which leads from the main entrance to the mihrab (niche in the qibla wall) and features a central dome, provided a new aesthetic focus which may have been designed to emphasize the area originally reserved for the caliph during prayers, near the mihrab. There is some uncertainty as to whether the dome was originally directly in front of the mihrab (as in many later mosques) or in its current position mid-way along the central nave. Scholars have attributed the design of the mosque's plan to the influences of Byzantine Christian basilicas in the region. Rafi Grafman and Myriam Rosen-Ayalon have argued that the first Umayyad Al-Aqsa Mosque built in Jerusalem, begun by Abd al-Malik (al-Walid's father) and now replaced by later constructions, had a layout very similar to the current Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and that it probably served as a model for the latter.\nThe mosque initially had no minaret towers, as this feature of mosque architecture was not established until later. However, at least two of the corners of the mosque's outer wall had short towers, platforms, or roof shelters which were used by the muezzin to issue the call to prayer (adhān), constituting a type of proto-minaret. These features were referred to as a mi'd͟hana (\"place of the adhān\") or as a ṣawma῾a (\"monk's cell\", due to their small size) in historical Arabic sources. Arabic sources indicated that they were former Roman towers which already stood at the corners of the temenos before the mosque's construction and were simply left intact and reused after construction.\n\nDecoration\nThe mosque was richly decorated. A rich composition of marble paneling covered the lower walls, though only minor examples of the original marbles have survived today near the east gate. The walls of the prayer hall were raised above the level of the old temenos walls, which allowed for new windows to be inserted in the upper walls. The windows had ornately carved grilles that foreshadowed the styles of windows in later Islamic architecture.\nThe most celebrated decorative element of all was the revetment of mosaics, which originally covered much of the courtyard and the interior hall. The best-preserved remains are still visible in the courtyard today.\nBy some estimates, the original mosque had the largest area of gold mosaics in the world, covering approximately 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft). The mosaics depict landscapes and buildings in a characteristic late Roman style. They reflected a wide variety of artistic styles used by mosaicists and painters since the 1st century CE, but the combined use of all these different styles in the same place was innovative at the time. Similar to the Dome of the Rock, built earlier by Abd al-Malik, vegetation and plants were the most common motif, but those of the Damascus mosque are more naturalistic. In addition to the large landscape depictions, a mosaic frieze with an intricate vine motif (referred to as the karma in Arabic historical sources) once ran around the walls of the prayer hall, above the level of the mihrab. The only notable omission is the absence of human and animal figures, which was likely a new restriction imposed by the Muslim patron. \n\nHistorical Arabic sources, often written in later centuries, suggest that both the craftsmen and the materials employed to create the mosque's mosaics were imported from the Byzantine capital of Constantinople. The 12th-century historian Ibn Asakir claimed that al-Walid pressured the Byzantine emperor into sending him 200 craftsmen by threatening to destroy all churches inside Umayyad territory if he refused. Many scholars, based on such evidence from Arabic sources, have accepted a Byzantine (Constantinopolitan) origin for the mosaics, while some, such as Creswell, have interpreted the story as a later embellishment of Muslim historians with a symbolic political significance.\nArt historian Finbarr Barry Flood notes that historical sources report many other apparent gifts of artisans and materials from the Byzantine emperors to the Umayyad caliphs and other rulers, probably reflecting a widespread admiration for Byzantine craftsmanship that continued in the early Islamic period. He notes that while Byzantine influence is indeed apparent in the mosque's mosaic imagery, there are multiple ways in which Byzantine mosaicists could have contributed to its production, including a collaboration with local craftsmen. Some scholars argue that the mosaic techniques in both the Dome of the Rock and the Umayyad Mosque, including their distinctive colour scheme, are more clearly consistent with the craftsmanship of Syro-Palestinian or Egyptian mosaicists. Archeologist Judith McKenzie suggests that the mosaics could have been designed by local artisans who oversaw their production, while any mosaicists sent from Constantinople could have been working under their supervision. A recent 2022 study of the chemical composition of mosaic tesserae in the Umayyad Mosque concluded that the majority were produced in Egypt around the time of the mosque's construction, matching other recent studies of samples from the Dome of the Rock and Khirbat al-Majfar that came to the same conclusion.\n\nScholars have long debated the meaning of the mosaic imagery. Some historical Muslim writers and some modern scholars have interpreted them as a topographical representation of all the cities in the known world (or within the Umayyad world), some have interpreted them as a representation of Damascus itself and the Barada River, and other scholars interpret them as a depiction of Paradise. The earliest known interpretation of the mosaics is by the 10th-century geographer al-Muqaddasi, who suggested a topographical meaning, commenting that \"there is hardly a tree or a notable town that has not been pictured on these walls.\" An early example of the Paradise interpretation dates from the writings of Ibn al-Najjar in the 12th century. This interpretation has been favoured by more recent scholarship. Some of the Qur'anic inscriptions that were originally present on the qibla wall of the mosque, mentioning the Day of Judgment and promising the reward of a heavenly garden (al-janna), may support this interpretation. Another clue is an account by historian Ibn Zabala in 814, which reports that one of the mosaicists who worked for al-Walid's reconstruction of the Prophet's Mosque in Medina (contemporary with the construction in Damascus) directly explained the mosaics there as a reproduction of the trees and palaces of Paradise, which suggests that the contemporary Umayyad mosaics in Damascus had the same intention.\nIn this interpretation, the lack of human figures in these scenes possibly represents a Paradise that stands empty until the arrival of its human inhabitants at the end of time. Other motifs in the mosaics have been cited to support a paradisal meaning and the imagery has been compared with both the descriptions of Paradise in the Qur'an and the earlier iconography of paradisal imagery in Late Antique art. According to Judith McKenzie, there is a similarity between certain architectural elements depicted in the Umayyad mosaics and those shown in Pompeian frescoes (such as broken pediments and tholoi with tented roofs and Corinthian columns), as well as some early Christian and Byzantine art, which are most likely depictions of the architecture of Hellenistic Alexandria. In Roman and Late Antique art, Alexandrian and Egyptian landscapes had a paradisal connotation. McKenzie argues that the Umayyad mosaics, extending these traditions, can thus be understood as a depiction of Paradise. The possibility also remains that the mosaic scenes combine more than one of these meanings at the same time; for example, by using paradisal imagery to represent Damascus or the Umayyad realm as an idealized, earthly paradise.\n\nThe mihrab\nThe original mihrab was one of the first concave mihrabs in the Islamic world, the second one known to exist after the one created in 706–707 during al-Walid's reconstruction of the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. The exact appearance of the mosque's original main mihrab is uncertain, due to the multiple repairs and restorations that took place over the centuries. Ibn Jubayr, who visited the mosque in 1184, described the inside of the mihrab as filled with miniature blind arcades whose arches resembled \"small mihrabs\", each filled with inlaid mother-of-pearl mosaics and framed by spiral columns of marble. This mihrab was famed across the Islamic world for its beauty, as noted by other writers of the era.\nIts appearance may have been imitated by other surviving mihrabs built under the Mamluk sultans al-Mansur Qalawun and al-Nasir Muhammad in the 13th and 14th centuries, such as the richly decorated mihrab of Qalawun's mausoleum in Cairo (completed in 1285). Scholars generally assume that the mihrab described by Ibn Jubayr dated from a restoration of the mosque in 1082. Another restoration occurred after 1401 and this version, which survived until another fire in 1893, was again decorated with miniature arcades, while its semi-dome was filled with coffering similar to Roman architecture. Finbarr Barry Flood has suggested that the perpetuation of the mihrab's arcaded decoration across several restorations indicates that the medieval restorations were aimed at preserving at least some of the original mihrab's appearance, and therefore the 8th-century Umayyad mihrab may have had these features.\n\nAbbasid and Fatimid era\nFollowing the toppling of the Umayyads in 750, the Abbasid dynasty came to power and moved the capital of the Caliphate to Baghdad. Apart from the attention given for strategic and commercial purposes, the Abbasids had no interest in Damascus. Thus, the Umayyad Mosque reportedly suffered under their rule, with little recorded building activity between the 8th and 10th centuries. However, the Abbasids did consider the mosque to be a major symbol of Islam's triumph, and thus it was spared the systematic eradication of the Umayyad legacy in the city. In 789–90 the Abbasid governor of Damascus, al-Fadl ibn Salih ibn Ali, constructed the Dome of the Treasury with the purpose of housing the mosque's funds. The so-called Dome of the Clock, standing in the eastern part of the courtyard, may have also been erected originally by the same Abbasid governor in 780. The 10th-century Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi credited the Abbasids for building the northern minaret (Madhanat al-Arous, meaning 'Minaret of the Bride') of the mosque in 831 during the reign of Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833). This was accompanied by al-Ma'mun's removal and replacement of Umayyad inscriptions in the mosque.\nBy the early 10th century, a monumental water clock had been installed by the entrance in the western part of the southern wall of the mosque, which was consequently known as Bab al-Sa'a ('Gate of the Clock') at the time but is known today as Bab al-Ziyada. This clock seems to have stopped functioning by the middle of the 12th century. Abbasid rule over Syria began crumbling during the early 10th century, and in the decades that followed, it came under the control of autonomous realms who were only nominally under Abbasid authority. The Fatimids of Egypt, who adhered to Shia Islam, conquered Damascus in 970, but few recorded improvements of the mosque were undertaken by the new rulers. The Umayyad Mosque's prestige allowed the residents of Damascus to establish the city as a center for Sunni intellectualism, enabling them to maintain relative independence from Fatimid religious authority. In 1069, large sections of the mosque, particularly the northern wall, were destroyed in a fire as a result of an uprising by the city's residents against the Fatimids' Berber army who were garrisoned there.\n\nSeljuk and Ayyubid era\nThe Sunni Muslim Seljuk Turks gained control of the city in 1078 and restored the nominal rule of the Abbasid Caliphate. The Seljuk ruler Tutush (r. 1079–1095) initiated the repair of damage caused by the 1069 fire. In 1082, his vizier, Abu Nasr Ahmad ibn Fadl, had the central dome restored in a more spectacular form; the two piers supporting it were reinforced and the original Umayyad mosaics of the northern inner façade were renewed. The northern riwaq ('portico') was rebuilt in 1089. The Seljuk atabeg of Damascus, Toghtekin (r. 1104–1128), repaired the northern wall in 1110 and two inscribed panels located above its doorways were dedicated to him. In 1113, the Seljuk atabeg of Mosul, Sharaf al-Din Mawdud (r. 1109–1113), was assassinated in the Umayyad Mosque. As the conflict between Damascus and the Crusaders intensified in the mid-12th century, the mosque was used as a principal rallying point calling on Muslims to defend the city and return Jerusalem to Muslim hands. Prominent imams, including Ibn Asakir, preached a spiritual jihad ('struggle') and when the Crusaders advanced towards Damascus in 1148, the city's residents heeded their calls; the Crusader army withdrew as a result of their resistance.\n\nDuring the reign of the Zengid ruler Nur ad-Din Zangi, which began in 1154, a second monumental clock, the Jayrun Water Clock, was built on his personal orders. It was constructed outside the eastern entrance to the mosque, called Bab Jayrun, by the architect Muhammad al-Sa'ati, was rebuilt by al-Sa'ati following a fire in 1167, and was eventually repaired by his son, Ridwan, in the early 13th century. It may have survived into the 14th century. The Arab geographer al-Idrisi visited the mosque in 1154.\nDamascus witnessed the establishment of several religious institutions under the Ayyubids, but the Umayyad Mosque retained its place as the center of religious life in the city. Muslim traveler Ibn Jubayr described the mosque as containing many different zawaya (religious lodges) for religious and Quranic studies. In 1173, the northern wall of the mosque was damaged again by the fire and was rebuilt by the Ayyubid sultan, Saladin (r. 1174–1193), along with the Minaret of the Bride, which had been destroyed in the 1069 fire. During the internal feuds between later Ayyubid princes, the city was dealt a great deal of damage, and the mosque's eastern minaret—known as the 'Minaret of Jesus'—was destroyed at the hands of as-Salih Ayyub of Egypt while besieging as-Salih Ismail of Damascus in 1245. The minaret was later rebuilt with little decoration. Saladin, along with many of his successors, were buried around the Umayyad Mosque (see Mausoleum of Saladin).\n\nMamluk era\nThe Mongols, under the leadership of the Nestorian Christian Kitbuqa, with the help of some submitted Western Christian forces, captured Damascus from the Ayyubids in 1260 while Kitbuqa's superior Hulagu Khan had returned to the Mongol Empire for other business. Bohemond VI of Antioch, one of the Western Christian generals in the invasion, ordered Catholic Mass to be performed in the Umayyad Mosque. However, the Muslim Mamluks of Egypt, led by Sultan Qutuz and Baybars, wrested control of the city from the Mongols later in the same year, killing Kitbuqa in the Battle of Ain Jalut, and the purpose of the Mosque was returned from Christian to its original Islamic function. In 1270, Baybars, by now sultan, ordered extensive restorations to the mosque, particularly its marble, mosaics and gildings. According to Baybars' biographer, Ibn Shaddad, the restorations cost the sultan 20,000 dinars. Among the largest mosaic fragments restored was a 34.5 by 7.3 metres (113 by 24 ft) segment in the western portico called the \"Barada panel\". The mosaics that decorated the mosque were a specific target of the restoration project and they had a major influence on Mamluk architecture in Syria and Egypt.\nIn 1285, the Hanbali scholar Ibn Taymiyya started teaching Qur'an exegesis in the mosque. When the Ilkhanid Mongols under Ghazan invaded the city in 1300, Ibn Taymiyya preached jihad, urging the citizens of Damascus to resist their occupation. The Mamluks under Sultan Qalawun drove out the Mongols later that year. When Qalawun's forces entered the city, the Mongols attempted to station several catapults in the Umayyad Mosque because the Mamluks had started fires around the citadel to prevent Mongol access to it. The attempt failed as the Mamluks burned the catapults before they were placed in the mosque.\nThe Mamluk viceroy of Syria, Tankiz, carried out restoration work in the mosque in 1326–1328. He reassembled the mosaics on the qibla wall and replaced all the marble tiles in the prayer hall. Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad also undertook major restoration work for the mosque in 1328. He demolished and completely rebuilt the unstable qibla wall and moved the Bab al-Ziyadah gate to the east. Much of that work was damaged during a fire that burned the mosque in 1339. Islamic art expert, Finbarr Barry Flood, describes the Bahri Mamluks' attitude towards the mosque as an \"obsessive interest\" and their efforts at maintaining, repairing, and restoring the mosque were unparalleled in any other period of Muslim rule. The Arab astronomer Ibn al-Shatir worked as the chief muwaqqit ('religious timekeeper') and the chief muezzin at the Umayyad Mosque from 1332 until he died in 1376. He erected a large sundial on the mosque's northern minaret in 1371, now lost. A replica was installed in its place in the modern period. The Minaret of Jesus was burnt down in a fire in 1392.\nThe Mongol conqueror Timur besieged Damascus in 1400. He ordered the burning of the city on 17 March 1401, and the fire ravaged the Umayyad Mosque. The eastern minaret was reduced to rubble, and the central dome collapsed. Another fire damaged the mosque in October 1479, causing the Mamluk sultan Qaytbay (r. 1468–1496) to sponsor repair works. This included the reconstruction of the southwestern minaret in 1488.\n\nOttoman era\nDamascus was conquered from the Mamluks by the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Selim I in 1516. The first Friday prayer performed in Selim's name in the Umayyad Mosque was attended by the sultan himself. The Ottomans used an endowment system (waqf) for religious sites as a means to link the local population with the central authority. The waqf of the Umayyad Mosque was the largest in the city, employing 596 people. Supervisory and clerical positions were reserved for Ottoman officials while religious offices were held mostly by members of the local ulema (Muslim scholars). Although the awqaf (plural of \"waqf\") were taxed, the waqf of the Umayyad Mosque was exempted from taxation. In 1518, the Ottoman governor of Damascus and supervisor of the mosque's waqf, Janbirdi al-Ghazali, had the mosque repaired and redecorated as part of his architectural reconstruction program for the city.\nThe prominent Sufi scholar Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi taught regularly at the Umayyad Mosque starting in 1661.\nThe khatib (preacher) of the Umayyad Mosque was one of the three most influential religious officials in Ottoman Damascus, the other two being the Hanafi mufti and the naqib al-ashraf. He served as a link between the imperial government in Constantinople and the elites of Damascus and was a key shaper of public opinion in the city. By 1650 members of the mercantile and scholarly Mahasini family held the position, retaining it for much of the 18th and early and mid-19th centuries, partly due to their links with the Shaykh al-Islam in the imperial capital. In the late 19th century, another Damascene family with connections in Constantinople, the Khatibs, vied for the position. After the death of the Mahasini preacher in 1869, a member of the Khatibs succeeded him.\nThe mosque's prayer hall was once again ravaged and partly destroyed by fire in 1893. A laborer engaging in repair work accidentally started the fire when he was smoking his nargila (water pipe). The fire destroyed the inner fabric of the prayer hall and caused the collapse of the mosque's central dome. The Ottomans fully restored the mosque, largely maintaining the original layout. The restoration process, which lasted nine years, did not attempt to reproduce the original decoration. The central mihrab was replaced and the dome was rebuilt in a contemporary Ottoman style. The rubble and damaged elements from the fire, including some of the original pillars and mosaic remains, were simply disposed of.\n\nUntil 1899 the mosque's library included the \"very old\" Qubbat al-Khazna collection; \"most of its holdings were given to the German emperor Wilhelm II and only a few pieces kept for the National Archives in Damascus.\"\nIt is the burial place of the first three officers of the Ottoman Aviation Squadrons who died on mission, in this case the Istanbul-Cairo expedition in 1914. They were Navy Lieutenant Fethi Bey and his navigator, Artillery First Lieutenant Sadık Bey and Artillery Second Lieutenant Nuri Bey.\n\nModern era\nThe Umayyad Mosque underwent major restorations in 1929 during the French Mandate over Syria and in 1954 and 1963 under the Syrian Republic.\nIn the 1980s and in the early 1990s, Syrian president Hafez al-Assad ordered a wide-scale renovation of the mosque. The methods and concepts of Assad's restoration project were heavily criticized by UNESCO, but the general approach in Syria was that the mosque was more of a symbolic monument rather than a historical one and thus, its renovation could only enhance the mosque's symbolism.\nIn 1990s, Mohammed Burhanuddin constructed a zarih of the martyrs of the Battle of Karbala, whose heads were brought to the Mosque after their defeat at the hands of the then Umayyad caliph, Yazid I.\nIn 2001, Pope John Paul II visited the mosque, primarily to visit the relics of John the Baptist. It was the first time a pope paid a visit to a mosque.\nOn March 15, 2011, the first significant protests related to the Arab Spring and eventually the Syrian civil war began at the Umayyad Mosque when 40–50 worshippers gathered outside the complex and chanted pro-democracy slogans. Syrian security forces swiftly quelled the protests and cordoned off the area during Friday prayers to prevent large-scale demonstrations.\n\nAfter the Fall of the Assad regime and the victory of opposition forces in the civil war, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham leader Ahmed al-Sharaa gave a victory speech from Umayyad Mosque during which he declared a new era in Syria's history.\n\nArchitecture\nThe ground plan of the Umayyad Mosque is rectangular in shape and measures 97 meters (318 ft) by 156 meters (512 ft). A large courtyard occupies the northern part of the mosque complex, while the prayer hall or haram ('sanctuary') covers the southern part. The mosque is enclosed by four exterior walls which were part of the temenos of the original Roman temple.\n\nSanctuary\nThree arcades make up the interior space of the sanctuary. They are parallel to the direction of prayer which is towards Mecca. The arcades are supported by two rows of stone Corinthian columns. Each of the arcades contain two levels. The first level consists of large semi-circular arches, while the second level is made up of double arches. This pattern is the same repeated by the arcades of the courtyard. The three interior arcades intersect in the center of the sanctuary with a larger, higher arcade that is perpendicular to the qibla wall and faces the mihrab and the minbar. The central transept divides the arcades into two halves each with eleven arches. The entire sanctuary measures 136 meters (446 ft) by 37 meters (121 ft) and takes up the southern half of the mosque complex.\nFour mihrabs line the sanctuary's rear wall, the main one being the Great Mihrab which is located roughly at the center of the wall. The Mihrab of the Sahaba, named after the sahaba ('companions of Muhammad') is situated in the eastern half. According to the 9th-century Muslim engineer Musa ibn Shakir, the latter mihrab was built during the mosque's initial construction and it became the third niche-formed mihrab in Islam's history.\nThe central dome of the mosque is known as the 'Dome of the Eagle' (Qubbat an-Nisr) and located atop the center of the prayer hall. The original wooden dome was replaced by one built of stone following the 1893 fire. It receives its name because it is thought to resemble an eagle, with the dome itself being the eagle's head while the eastern and western flanks of the prayer hall represent the wings. With a height of 36 meters (118 ft), the dome rests on an octagonal substructure with two arched windows on each of its sides. It is supported by the central interior arcade and has openings along its parameter.\n\nCourtyard\nIn the courtyard (sahn), the level of the stone pavement had become uneven over time due to several repairs throughout the mosque's history. Recent work on the courtyard has restored it to its consistent Umayyad-era levels. Arcades (riwaq) surround the courtyard supported by alternating stone columns and piers. There is one pier in between every two columns. Because the northern part of the courtyard had been destroyed in an earthquake in 1759, the arcade is not consistent; when the northern wall was rebuilt the columns that were supporting it were not. The courtyard and its arcades contain the largest preserved remnants of the mosque's Umayyad-era mosaic decoration.\nSeveral domed pavilions stand in the courtyard. The Dome of the Treasury is an octagonal structure decorated with mosaics, standing on eight Roman columns in the western part of the courtyard. Its 8th-century mosaics were largely remade in the late 20th-century restoration. In a mirror position on the other side of the courtyard is the Dome of the Clock, another octagonal domed pavilion. Near the middle of the courtyard, sheltering an ablutions fountain at ground level, is a rectangular pavilion which is a modern reconstruction of a late Ottoman pavilion.\n\nMinarets\nWithin the Umayyad Mosque complex are three minarets. The Minaret of Isa on the southeast corner, the Minaret of Qaytbay (also called Madhanat al-Gharbiyya) on the southwest corner, and the Minaret of the Bride located along the northern wall.\n\nMinaret of the Bride\nThe Minaret of the Bride was the first one built and is located on the mosque's northern wall. The exact year of the minaret's original construction is unknown. The bottom part of the minaret most likely dates back to the Abbasid era in the 9th century. While it is possible that the Umayyads built it, there is no indication that a minaret on the northern wall was a part of al-Walid I's initial concept. Al-Muqaddasi visited the minaret in 985 when Damascus was under Abbasid control and described it as \"recently built\". The upper segment was constructed in 1174. This minaret is used by the muezzin for the call to prayer (adhan) and there is a spiral staircase of 160 stone steps that lead to the muezzin's calling position.\nThe Minaret of the Bride is divided into two sections; the main tower and the spire which are separated by a lead roof. The oldest part of the minaret, or the main tower, is square in shape, has four galleries, and consists of two different forms of masonry; the base consists of large blocks, while the upper section is built of dressed stone. There are two light openings near the top of the main tower, before the roof, with horseshoe arches and cubical capitals enclosed in a single arch. A smaller arched corbel is located below these openings. According to local legend, the minaret is named after the daughter of the merchant who provided the lead for the minaret's roof who was married to Syria's ruler at the time. Attached to the Minaret of the Bride is the 18th-century replica of the 14th-century sundial built by Ibn al-Shatir.\n\nMinaret of Isa\nThe Minaret of Isa is around 77 meters (253 ft) in height and the tallest of the three minarets. Some sources claim it was originally built by the Abbasids in the 9th century. The main body of the current minaret was built by the Ayyubids in 1247, but the upper section was constructed by the Ottomans. The main body of the minaret is square-shaped and the spire is octagonal. It tapers to a point and is surmounted by a crescent (as are the other two minarets). Two covered galleries are situated in the main body and two open galleries are located on the spire. Islamic belief holds that Isa (Jesus) will descend from heaven during the time of the Fajr prayer and will pray behind the Mahdi. He will then confront the Antichrist. According to local Damascene tradition, relating from hadith, Isa will reach earth via the Minaret of Isa, hence its name. Ibn Kathir, a prominent 14th-century Muslim scholar, backed this notion.\n\nMinaret of Qaytbay\nThe Minaret of Qaytbay was built by Qaytbay in 1488. He also commissioned its renovation due to the 1479 fire. The minaret displays strong Islamic-era Egyptian architectural influence typical of the Mamluk period. It is octagonal in shape and built in receding sections with three galleries. It is generally believed that both the Minaret of Jesus and the Western Minaret were built on the foundation of ancient Roman towers. In October 2025, nearly one year after the fall of the Assad regime, the name of Hafez al-Assad, which had been inscribed on the Qaytbay Minaret following earlier restoration works, was removed.\n\nInfluence on mosque architecture\nThe Umayyad Mosque is one of the few early mosques in the world to have maintained the same general structure and architectural features since its initial construction in the early 8th century. Its Umayyad character has not been significantly altered. Since its establishment, the mosque has served as a model for congregational mosque architecture in Syria as well as globally. According to Flood, \"the construction of the Damascus mosque not only irrevocably altered the urban landscape of the city, inscribing upon it a permanent affirmation of Muslim hegemony, but by giving the Syrian congregational mosque its definitive form it also transformed the subsequent history of the mosque in general.\" The influence of the Umayyad Mosque's ground plan can be found in many mosques in the historic Muslim world, such as the al-Azhar Mosque and Baybars Mosque in Cairo, the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain, and the Bursa Grand Mosque and Edirne's Grand Mosque in Turkey.\n\nReligious significance\nAccording to some, the mosque is the fourth holiest site of Islam. A Christian tradition dating to the 6th century developed an association between the former cathedral structure and John the Baptist. Legend had it that his head was buried there. Ibn al-Faqih relays that during the construction of the mosque, workers found a cave-chapel which had a box containing the head of John the Baptist, known as Yahya ibn Zakariya by Muslims. Upon learning of that and examining it, al-Walid I ordered the head buried under a specific pillar in the mosque that was later inlaid with marble.\nAccording to one hadith reported by Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, the Great Mosque of Damascus is the site where Jesus will descend from heaven at his Second Coming, appearing on a \"white minaret\". Most Muslim theologians interpret this passage as symbolic rather than literal. In a study of Muslim sources, William Richard Oakes suggests that some aspects of this hadith could date from the late Umayyad period, when the mosque was built, rather than from Muhammad's time, when Damascus had not yet been conquered by Muslims.\nTwo shrines commemorating the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grandson Husayn ibn Ali, whose martyrdom is also compared in Shi'a tradition to that of John the Baptist, exist within the building premises.\n\nSee also\nAblaq\nGreat Mosque of Aleppo\nList of the oldest mosques in the world\nReligious significance of the Syrian region\nTimeline of Islamic history\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAbdulkarim, Maamoun (2003). \"Syria in the times of Apollodorus of Damascus\".

          "summary": "The Umayyad Mosque (Arabic: ٱلْجَامِع ٱلْأُمَوِي‎, romanized: al-Jāmiʿ al-Umawī), also known as the Great Mosque of Damascus (Arabic: جَامِع بَنِي أُمَيَّة ٱلْكَبِيْر‎, romanized: Jāmiʿ Banī Umayyah al-Kabīr), located in the old city of Damascus, the capital of Syria, is one of the largest and oldest mosques in the world. Its religious importance stems from the eschatological reports concerning the mosque and historic events associated with it. Christian and Muslim tradition alike consider it the burial place of John the Baptist's head, a tradition originating in the 6th century. Two shrines inside the premises commemorate the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grandson Husayn ibn Ali, whose martyrdom is frequently compared to that of John the Baptist. It is considered to be the oldest mosque still in use in its original form.\nThe site has been used as a house of worship since the Iron Age, when the Arameans built on it a temple dedicated to their god of rain, Hadad. It was later associated with the Greek god Zeus during the Hellenistic period. Under Roman rule after 64 CE, it was converted into the center of the imperial cult of Jupiter, the Roman god of rain, becoming one of the largest temples in Syria. The current walls of the mosque were the inner walls of the Temple of Jupiter (built in the 1st century BC to 4th century AD). When the empire in Syria transitioned to Christian Byzantine rule, Emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395) transformed it into a cathedral and the seat of the second-highest-ranking bishop in the Patriarchate of Antioch.\nAfter the Muslim conquest of Damascus in 634, part of the cathedral was designated as a small prayer house (musalla) for the Muslim conquerors. As the Muslim community grew, the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715) confiscated the rest of the cathedral for Muslim use, returning to the Christians other properties in the city as compensation. The structure was largely demolished and a grand congregational mosque complex was built in its place. The new structure was built over nine years by thousands of laborers and artisans from across the Islamic and Byzantine empires at considerable expense and was funded by the war booty of Umayyad conquests and taxes on the Arab troops of Damascus. Unlike the simpler mosques of the time, the Umayyad Mosque had a large basilical plan with three parallel aisles and a perpendicular central nave leading from the mosque's entrance to the world's second concave mihrab (prayer niche). The mosque was noted for its rich compositions of marble paneling and its extensive gold mosaics of vegetal motifs, covering some 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft), likely the largest in the world. \nUnder Abbasid rule (750–860), new structures were added, including the Dome of the Treasury and the Minaret of the Bride, while the Mamluks (1260–1516) undertook major restoration efforts and added the Minaret of Qaytbay. The Umayyad Mosque innovated and influenced nascent Islamic architecture by introducing a more organized and monumental design compared to earlier mosques. It enjoyed great prestige throughout its history and was regarded as a \"wonder of the world\" by many medieval Muslim writers. Although the original structure has been altered several times due to fire, war damage, and repairs, it is one of the few mosques to maintain the same form and architectural features of its 8th-century construction, as well as its Umayyad character.",

          "content": "جامع بني اميه الكبير، ويعرف اختصارًا بالجامع الاموي، هو المسجد الذي امر الوليد بن عبد الملك بتشييده في دمشق، وهو من اشهر المساجد وافخمها، واحد عجائب الاسلام السبعه في العالم.\nبدا بناء الجامع الاموي في عام 705م على يد الوليد بن عبد الملك، وقد حشد له صنّاعاً من الفرس والهنود، واوفد امبراطور بيزنطه مئه فنان يوناني للمشاركه في التزيين، ونال قسطًا وافرًا من المدح والوصف، لا سيَّما من الرحاله والمؤرخين والادباء الذين مرّوا بدمشق عبر العصور واطروا بشكل خاص على زينه سقف المسجد وجدرانه الفسيفسائيه الملونه، والرخام المستعمل في البناء. الا ان اغلبها طُمس بناءً على فتاوى بعدم جوزاها حتى اُعيد اكتشافها وترميمها عام 1928. وقد وصفها المؤرخ فيليب حتي بانها «تمثل الصناعه الاهليه السوريه وليس الفن اليوناني او البيزنطي.»\nيتميز الجامع الاموي ايضًا بكونه اول مسجد ظهر فيه المحراب والحنيه نتيجه طراز البناء الذي كان يشكل كنيسه يوحنا المعمدان سابقاً. اما مئذنته الشماليه، وهي اقدم ماذنه الثلاث، فتعود لعهد الوليد بن عبد الملك. كما استخدمت ايضاً منارهً لمدينه دمشق، وكانت ستعمل خلال القرون الوسطى للمنقطين للتامل والصلاه، ومنها انتشر نموذج المئذنه المربعه الى سائر انحاء سوريا وشمال افريقيا والاندلس.\nيحتوي الجامع على مدفن جسد يوحنا المعمدان -النبي يحيى- نسيب المسيح، ولم يبقَ من اثاره المسيحيه سوى جرن العماد ونقش باليونانيه في مدح المسيح على احد الجدران. كما يحوي المسجد ايضاً على الفتحه التي وضع فيها راس الحسين بن علي حين حُمل الى دمشق. واُلحق بالمسجد مقبره تضم رفات صلاح الدين الايوبي.\nاحترقت اجزاء من الجامع ثلاث مرات: الاولى عام 1069م، والثانيه على يد تيمورلنك عام 1400م، والثالثه عام 1893م. وكانت اخر عمليات الترميم في العصر الحديث عام 1994م.\n\nالموقع\nيقع الجامع الاموي في وسط مدينه دمشق القديمه، المنطقه المدرجه على لائحه التراث العالمي.\n\nالتاريخ\nقبل الاسلام\nيعود تاريخ المسجد الاموي في سوريه الى 1200 سنه قبل الميلاد، حيث كانت دمشق عاصمه لدوله ارام دمشق خلال العصر الحديدي. وقد كان اراميو غرب سوريا يعبدون «حدد الارامي،» اله الخصب والرعد والمطر حسب معتقدهم، لذلك اقاموا معبداً مخصصاً له في موقع «المسجد الاموي» المعاصر. ولا يُعرف بالضبط كيف بدا المعبد، لكن يعتقد انه اتَّبع النموذج المعماري الكنعاني السامي التقليدي. وهو يشبه معبد القدس، ويتالف من فناء مسور وغرفه صغيره للعباده. وقد بقي حجر واحد من المعبد الارامي يعود لحكم الملك حازائيل، وهو حالياً يُعرض في متحف دمشق الوطني.\nواصل معبد حدد الارامي القيام بدوره المركزي في المدينه حتى غزا الرومان دمشق في عام 64م فاقاموا فيه معبداً للاله جوبيتر، فقاموا باعاده تكوين وتوسيع المعبد تحت اشراف مهندس معماري وُلد في دمشق يدعى ابولودوروس، وهو من صمم ونفذ التصميم الجديد. وقد اُعجب السكان المحليين بتماثُل وابعاد «معبد جوبيتر اليوناني الروماني.» وباستثناء زياده حجم المبنى، حافظ الرومانيون على معظم تصميمه الاصلي، وتُرِك الفناء المسور سليماً الى حد كبير. واقيمت في وسط الفناء غرفه داخليه، وكان هناك برج واحد في كل من الزوايا الاربع للفناء. كما استخدمت الابراج للطقوس تمشياً مع التقاليد الدينيه الساميه القديمه حيث قُدِّمت الاضاحي في الاماكن المرتفعه.\nاصبح المعبد الروماني الجديد السلطه التشريعيه الدينيه في مدينه دمشق بسبب حجمه الكبير، وكان الغرض من تشييده (وقد اصبح فيما بعد المركز الرئيسي للعباده في الامبراطوريه الرومانيه) ان يكون منافساً للمعبد العبري في القدس. وقد اضيف لـ«معبد جوبيتر» المزيد من الاضافات خلال الفتره الاولى من الحكم الروماني للمدينه، واصبح اغلب كهنه المعبد اثرياء بسبب التبرعات التي كانوا يجمعونها من المواطنين الاثرياء في دمشق. وقد وُسِّعت البوابه الشرقيه لفناء المعبد في عهد سيبتيموس سيفيروس (حكم 193-211 م).\nبحلول القرن الرابع للميلاد اصبح المعبد مشهوراً بسبب حجمه وجماله وفُصل عن المدينه بمجموعتين من الجدران. وكان الجدار الاول، الذي يعتبر الاكبر، يمتد على مساحه واسعه شملت السوق. اما الجدار الثاني فيحيط بحرم معبد جوبيتر الاصلي. وكان هذا المعبد الاكبر في سوريا الرومانيه. وفي نهايه القرن الرابع للميلاد، تحديداً في عام 391، حُوِّل معبد جوبيتر الى كاتدرائيه القديس يوحنا بامر من الامبراطور ثيودوسيوس الاول (حكم بين 379 و395 للميلاد). لكن هذه الكاتدرائيه المسيحيه لم تكن مكرسه مباشره ليوحنا المعمدان -النبي يحيى، وكُرِّست لاحقًا من القرن السادس للميلاد، اذ تشير الاسطوره المحليه ان راس يوحنا المعمدان -النبي يحيى - دُفن هناك. وكانت الكاتدرائيه بمثابه مقر اسقف دمشق، الذي يحتل المرتبه الثانيه ضمن بطريركيه انطاكيه بعد البطريرك نفسه.\nولا تزال اطلال المعبد باقيه في منطقه سوق الحريم وحتى منطقه القيمريه.\n\nالفتح الاسلامي وقيام المسجد\nفي عام 634، تمت محاصره دمشق من طرف الجيوش الاسلاميه بقياده خالد بن الوليد، ونجح خالد بضمها للاراضي الاسلاميه صلحا. بعد عقود من فتح دمشق، اصبحت الخلافه الاسلاميه تحت حكم السلاله الامويه، الذين اختاروا دمشق لتكون العاصمه الاداريه للعالم الاسلامي. وقد كلف الخليفه الاموي السادس، الوليد بن عبد الملك (705–715م) الصناع والمهندسين، ببناء المسجد في موقع الكاتدرائيه البيزنطيه في عام 706 م. قبل هذا، كانت الكاتدرائيه لا تزال قيد الاستخدام من طرف المسيحيين المحليين، ولكن قد شُيِّدت غرفه صلاه (المصلي) للمسلمين في الجزء الجنوبي الشرقي من المبنى. الوليد، الذي اشرف شخصياً على المشروع، امر بهدم معظم الكاتدرائيه، بما في ذلك المصلى، وغُيِّر تخطيط المبنى تماما، ليستخدم بصفته مسجداً كبيراً لصلاه الجماعه لمواطني دمشق ومعلماً دينياً لمدينه دمشق.احتج المسيحيون على هذه الخطوه، وردا على هذا الاحتجاج امر الوليد باسترجاع جميع الكنائس المصادره الاخرى في المدينه الى المسيحيين كتعويض. واكتمل بناء المسجد في عام 715 م، بعد وقت قصير من وفاه الوليد، وخلفه سليمان بن عبد الملك (715–717م) في الحكم.\nووفقا لمؤرخ القرن العاشر ابن الفقيه، اُنفق ما بين 600 الف و 1,000,000 دينار على المشروع، وقد اشتغل به حرفيون اقباط، فضلا عن عمال فارسيين وهنديين ويونانيين الذين يشكلون الجزء الاكبر من القوه العامله التي تتالف من 12 الف شخص. ويذكر ابن الفقيه ايضا ان العمال وجدوا مغاره تعود للكنيسه البيزنطيه اثناء بناء المسجد، وكانت هذه المغاره تحتوي على صندوق يوجد به راس القديس يوحنا المعمدان حسب المعتقد المسيحي، او النبي يحيى بن زكريا في الاسلام. فامر الوليد بتركه على حاله، وجعل عمودا قائما على المغاره كعلامه مميزه ثم وضع فوقه تابوت عليه اسم النبي يحيى.\n\nفي اعقاب الانتفاضه التي انهت حكم الامويين عام 750م على يد العباسيين، واصبحت الخلافه الاسلاميه تحت حكم السلاله العباسيه الذين قاموا نقل عاصمه الخلافه من دمشق الى بغداد. وبصرف النظر عن موقع دمشق الاستراتيجي والتجاري، لم يكن للعباسيون مصالح في دمشق. وبالتالي، فان المسجد الاموي قد عانى في بدايه حكمهم، مع القليل من نشاط البناء المسجل بين القرنين 8 و 10 . ومع ذلك، فان العباسيين نظروا للمسجد ليكون رمزا رئيسيا لانتصار الاسلام، وبالتالي نجا المسجد من منهجيه القضاء على تركه الامويين في مدينه دمشق. . وقام الفضل بن صالح بن علي الحاكم العباسي في دمشق، ببناء قبه في القسم الشرقي من المسجد في 780م. وبعد تسع سنوات، بدا بتشييد قبه الخزينه بغرض ادخار اموال المسجد  وجاء في مذكرات الجغرافي المقدسي، ان العباسيين قاموا ببناء المئذنه الشماليه («مئذنه العروس») من المسجد في عام 831 في عهد الخليفه المامون (813-833). وقد امر المامون بازاله واستبدال النقوش الامويه في المسجد.\nبحلول القرن 10م، رُكِّبت ساعه ضخمه عند المدخل في الجزء الغربي من الجدار الجنوبي للمسجد (باب زياده) ويبدو ان هذه الساعه قد توقفت عن عملها بحلول منتصف القرن 12م.\n\nاصبح الحكم العباسي على بلاد الشام متداعيا خلال القرن 10، وفي العقود التي تلت ذلك، اصبحت بلاد الشام خاضعه لحكم الامراء المحليين، وكانت تابعه للخلافه العباسيه اسميا فقط. وفي عام 970م، قام الفاطميون من مصر، بغزوا دمشق، واجرى الفاطميون بعض التحسينات المسجله للمسجد. وسمح لسكان دمشق بممارسه مذهبهم السني داخل الجامع الاموي في سكان، وتمكينهم من الحفاظ على الاستقلال النسبي من السلطه الدينيه الفاطميه الشيعيه. وفي 1069، دُمِّرت اجزاء كبيره من المسجد، خاصه الجدار الشمالي، في حريق نتيجه لانتفاضه سكان مدينه دمشق ضد الجيش الفاطمي بسبب الاعتداءات من طرف الثكنات الفاطميه في حق سكان دمشق.\n\nعصر السلاجقه والايوبيين\nفي سنه 1078م، استعاد سلاجقه الاتراك مدينه دمشق من ايدي الفاطميين، واصبحت دمشق تابعه للخلافه العباسيه اسميا فقط. وشرع الملك السلجوقي تتش بن الب ارسلان (حكم 1079-1095) لاصلاح الاضرار الناجمه عن الحريق الذي اصاب المسجد سنه 1069، وفي عام 1082م، قام ابو نصر احمد بن الفضل وزير تتش السلجوقي، باعاده تشييد القبه المركزيه في شكل اكثر اثاره؛ وقام ايضا بترميم اثنين من الارصفه دعم وتجديد الفسيفساء الامويه الاصليه من الواجهه الداخليه الشماليه للمسجد. واعيد بناء الرواق الشمالي في عام 1089م. وفي عام 1110م، قام ظاهر الدين طغتكين (حكم 1104-1128) وهو احد اتابكه السلاجقه في دمشق، باصلاح الجدار الشمالي وخُصص نقشان له ادرجا فوق مدخل. وفي عام 1113، اُغتيل شرف الدين مودود (حكم 1109-1113) احد اتابكه السلاجقه في الموصل في الجامع الاموي. وبما ان الصراع بين دمشق والصليبيين زاد في منتصف القرن 12م، كان المسجد الاموي بمثابه نقطه التجمع الرئيسيه لدعوه المسلمين للدفاع عن المدينه واستعاده القدس الى ايدي المسلمين. ويُعتبر ابن عساكر احد الائمه البارزين الذي بشروا بالجهاد، وعندما تقدم الصليبيون نحو دمشق سنه 1148، استجاب سكان المدينه لدعوات المطالبه بالجهاد؛ وعلى اثر هذا انسحب الجيش الصليبي نتيجه المقاومه البطوليه لسكان دمشق.\n\nوفي عام 1154 م، خلال عهد نور الدين زنكي، بنيت ساعه اثريه ثانيه، وساعه جيرون المائيه، باوامر شخصيه من نور الدين. وشيدت الساعه من خارج المدخل الشرقي للمسجد (باب جيرون) من قبل واعاد بناؤها المعماري محمد الساعاتي، بعد حريق اصاب المسجد في عام 1167، كما رُمِّمت في نهايه المطاف على يد ابنه، رضوان، في اوائل القرن 13. وقد نجت من حريق في القرن 14. وقد زار الجغرافي العربي الادريسي المسجد الاموي عام 1154.\nوفي العهد الايوبي شهدت دمشق انشاء العديد من المؤسسات الدينيه، واُبقي على الجامع الاموي في مكانه كمركز للحياه الدينيه في المدينه. ووصف الرحاله الاندلسي ابن جبير اهميه المسجد كمركز شامل للعلوم الدينيه، نظرا لاحتوائه العديد من الزوايا المختلفه للدراسات الدينيه والقرانيه. وفي عام 1173، تعرض الجدار الشمالي للمسجد مره اخرى لاضرار بسبب اندلاع حريق، واعيد بناؤه من قبل السلطان الايوبي صلاح الدين (حكم 1174-1193)، جنبا الى جنب مع مئذنه العروس، التي كانت قد دمرت في الحريق الذي وقع سنه 1069م، وخلال النزاعات الداخليه بين الامراء الايوبيين لاحقًا، تعرضت مدينه دمشق بسب هذه النزاعات لاضرار كبيره، وفي عام 1245م، دُمِّرت المئذنه الشرقيه للمسجد المعروفه بمئذنه عيسى على يد الصالح ايوب سابع خلافاء بني ايوب بمصر، في اثناء محاصرته لدمشق في عهد الصالح اسماعيل الامير الايوبي لدمشق. وقد اعيد بناء المئذنه لاحقًا مع اضافه زخرفه قليله لها.\nدُفن صلاح الدين الايوبي مع العديد من خلفائه، حول المسجد الاموي.\n\nدوله المماليك\nوفي عام 1260م. تحالف المغول، بقياده كتبغا مع القوات الصليبيه، واستولوا على دمشق من الايوبيين، وقد امر بوهيموند السادس امير اماره انطاكيه، باقامه القداس الكاثوليكي في «المسجد الاموي». ومع ذلك، استطاع المماليك بقياده قطز وبيبرس، استرجاع مدينه دمشق لاحقًا في نفس العام. وفي عام 1270، امر بيبرس بترميمات واسعه النطاق للمسجد، لا سيما الرخام والفسيفساء والايرمينيه. ووفقا لكاتب سيره بيبرس، ابن شداد، ان تكلفه ترميمات التي اقيمت في عهد بيبرس بلغت 20,000 ديناراً. وكان من بين اكبر الشظايا التي اضيفت للمسجد هي قطعه فسيفساء يبلغ طولها 34.5 متر وعرضها 7.3 متر، وقد اقيمت هذه الفسيفساء في الرواق الغربي وتسمى لوحه بردى. وكانت هذه القطعه من الفسيفساء التي زينت المسجد جزء من مشروع الترميم الذي شمل المسجد، وكان لها تاثير كبير في عماره المماليك في مصر والشام.\nفي عام 1285م، بدا العالم ابن تيميه بتدريس تفسير القران في المسجد. وفي عام 1300م، قام الخانيه المغول بقياده محمود غازان بغزو مدينه دمشق، فقام ابن تيميه بحثّ مواطني دمشق على الجهاد ومقاومه الاحتلال. واستطاع المماليك بقياده قلاوون بطرد المغول لاحقًا من تلك السنه. وعندما دخلت قوات قلاوون الى المدينه، حاول المغول اقامه عده مجانيق في «المسجد الاموي» لكن محاولتهم باءت بالفشل. وشرع المماليك بحرق المجانيق قبل ان توضع في المسجد.\nوفي الاعوام الممتده مابين 1326-1328م، قام الوالي المملوكي في الشام، تانكيز، باعمال ترميم في المسجد، وامر باعاده تجميع لوحات الفسيفساء على جدار القبله واستبدال كل البلاط في قاعه الصلاه بالرخام. كما قام السلطان المملوكي الناصر محمد بن قلاوون باعمال ترميم رئيسيه للمسجد في عام 1328. وقد هدمت قبله الجدار غير المستقره واُعيد بناؤها ونُقلت بوابه باب زياده الى الجهه الشرقيه من المسجد. وقد تضرر جزء كبير من هذه الاعمال خلال الحريق الذي احرق المسجد في عام 1339. وقد وصف خبير الفن الاسلامي، فينبار ب.فلوود. دور المماليك البحريه في اعاده ترميم المسجد الاموي بالهوس، وجهودهم في صيانه واصلاح واستعاده المسجد كانت لا مثيل لها في اي فتره اخرى من حكم الاسلامي لدمشق. وقد قضى عالم الفلك العربي ابن الشاطر معظم حياته في وظيفه التوقيت ورئاسه المؤذنين في الجامع الاموي من عام 1332 حتى وفاته في عام 1376. وقد قيل انه قام بتنصيب مزوله كبيره على المئذنه الشماليه للمسجد في عام 1371. وفي عام 1392م احترقت مئذنه عيسى خلال حريق اصاب المسجد عام 1392م .\nوفي عام 1400، غزا تيمور دمشق. واصدر اوامره باحراق المدينه يوم 17 اذار/مارس، وقد دمر الحريق اجزاء كبيره من المسجد الاموي. وانهارت المئذنه الشرقيه والقبه المركزيه. ورُمِّمت لاحقًا، واضيفت مئذنه في جهه الجنوب الغربي من المسجد خلال عهد السلطان المملوكي قايتباي في عام 1488م.\n\nالدوله العثمانيه\nفي عام 1516م، سيطر العثمانيون على دمشق بقياده سليم الاول بعد انتصارهم على المماليك في معركه مرج دابق. وحضر سليم الاول لتاديه صلاه الجمعه في الجامع الاموي . واستخدم العثمانيون نظام الوقف للمواقع الدينيه كوسيله لربط السكان المحليين مع السلطه المركزيه. وكان وقف الجامع الاموي هو الاكبر في المدينه، ووظِّف 596 شخص. وخُصصت اغلب الوظائف الاشرافيه والكتابيه للمسؤولين العثمانيين في حين خُصصت المكاتب الدينيه في الغالب للعلماء المحليين. على الرغم من ان الاوقاف تخضع للضريبه، فقداُعفي الجامع الاموي منها. وفي عام 1518، قام جانبيردي الغزالي الوالي العثماني لدمشق والمشرف العام لوقف المسجد، بعمليات اصلاح وتزيين المسجد كجزء من برنامجه باعاده اعمار مدينه دمشق.\nوفي عام 1661م عُيِّن الباحث الصوفي البارز عبد الغني النابلسي للتدريس في المسجد الاموي.\n\nوفي عام 1893م شب حريق ادى الى تدمير معظم الفسيفساء والالواح الرخاميه، ولكن اُعيدا في وقت لاحق. وقد دمر الحريق ايضا النسيج الداخلي لقاعه الصلاه وتسبب في انهيار القبه الوسطى للمسجد. والسبب الرئيسي لهذا الحريق هو احد العمال الذين كانوا يقومون باعمال ترميم للمسجد، وقد كان هذا العامل يقوم بطريق الخطا بتدخين النارجيله. وقد قام العثمانيون باعاده تشييد كامل المسجد، ولكن اُحتفظ بالهيكل الاصيل احتفاظاً كبيراً.\nوفي عام 1899م، اعطيت معظم محتويات قبه الخزنه الى الامبراطور الالماني فيلهلم الثاني واُحتفظ بعدد قليل من القطع في الارشيف الوطني في دمشق\"\n\nسوريا الحديثه\nالانتداب الفرنسي\nفي عام 1929، كان اهالي دمشق يجتمعون في الجامع الاموي كل جمعه، ليقوموا بمظاهرات مندده ضد سلطات الانتداب الفرنسي، ولم يقتحم الفرنسيون الجامع طيله وجودهم في سوريا لمعرفتهم بمكانه الجامع الاموي عند اهل الشام.\nوقد خضع المسجد الاموي لترميمات كبرى خلال الانتداب الفرنسي على سوريا، واستمرت حتى عام 1963 في ظل الجمهوريه السوريه الاولى.\n\nما بعد الاستعمار\nفي الثمانينات وفي اوائل التسعينات، امر الرئيس السوري حافظ الاسد بعمليه تجديد واسعه النطاق للمسجد. وشملت الترميمات المئذنه الغربيه للمسجد (مئذنه قيتابي) والواجه الغربيه للجامع، والجدار الشمالي للجامع المطل على ضريح صلاح الدين، كما اعيد تبليط المدخل الغربي للجامع، وتجديد الارضيات وتبديل القواعد الحجريه التالفه للاعمده، ومعالجه الخشبيات التالفه وترميم واصلاح الصالات واعاده انشاء وتركيب قبه داخل صحن الجامع، اضافهً لانشاء شبكه اطفاء خاصه بالمسجد.\nوقد انتهت اعمال الترميم والاصلاح في سنه 1414هـ / 1994م، واعيد افتتاح المسجد.\nوفي عام 2001، زار البابا يوحنا بولس الثاني المسجد، لرؤيه اثار مقام يوحنا المعمدان. وكانت هذه هي المره الاولى التي يقوم فيها البابا بزياره الى مسجد.\nوفي 15 مارس 2011، بدات اول الاحتجاجات التي تتعلق بالحرب الاهليه السوريه في المسجد الاموي عندما اجتمع مابين 40-50 مصلٍّ، حيث قام المتظاهرون برفع شعارات تطالب بالديمقراطيه. لكن قوات الامن السوريه قامت بقمع الاحتجاجات بسرعه، وطُوِّق المسجد خلال صلاه الجمعه لمنع ظهور مظاهرات الواسعه النطاق.\n\nالعماره\nالفناء وحرم الجامع\nارضيه المسجد الاموي هي مستطيله الشكل وهي بقياس 97 متر عرض و 156 متر طول. ويحتل الفناء الجزء الاكبر من المسجد وهو يغطي الجزء الخارجي الشمالي من المسجد، في حين يغطي حرم الجامع الجزء الجنوبي من المسجد. ويحيط فناء المسجد اربعه جدران خارجيه. اما الارصفه الحجريه للفناء فقد اصبحت متفاوته بمرور الزمن بسبب الاصلاحات التي مر بها المسجد على مدار التاريخ، وقد سُويَّت مؤخرًا. اما الاروقه المحيطه بالفناء فقد دُعِمت باعمده حجريه وارصفه بشكل متناوب. ويوجد رصيف واحد بين كل عمودين. نظراً لان الجزء الشمالي من الفناء قد دمر في زلزال وقع في عام 1759، كما ان الممرات ليست متسقه؛ ويرجع ذلك لعدم وجود الاعمده التي كانت تدعم ذلك، عندما اعيد بناء الجدار الشمالي. كما يوجد ايضاً داخل صحن الجامع عمودان ذوو راس نحاسي مزخرف كانا يستعملان للاضاءه.\nوتتكون المساحه الداخليه من الحرم من ثلاثه اروقه. وهي موازيه لاتجاه الصلاه نحو مكه المكرمه. ودُعِمت الاروقه بصفين من الاعمده الكورنثيه. وكل واحد من هذه الاروقه ينقسم الى مستويين. ويتالف المستوى الاول من اقواس نصف دائريه كبيره، في حين ان المستوى الثاني يتكون من اقواس مزدوجه. ويتكرر هذا النمط في اروقه الفناء. اما الاروقه الداخليه الثلاثه تتقاطع في وسط الحرم مع رواق كبير، يوازي جدار القبله («اتجاه الصلاه») ويواجه المحراب والمنبر. وينقسم الجناح المركزي في الاروقه الى نصفين ويتكون من احد عشر قوسًا. والحرم الشريف هو بقياس 136 متر طول و37 متر عرض.\nكما يوجد داخل فناء الجامع ثلاث منشئات صغيره وهي:\n\nقبه الخزنه\n\nانشئت قبه الخزنه بدايه في العهد العباسي في عام 789م، واستخدمت كخزنه لاموال الجامع، ومن ثم اصبحت مكتبه لكتب ومخطوطات الجامع النفيسه.\n\nقبه الوضوء\nانشئت قبه الوضوء بدايه في العهد العباسي، وانهارت بعد وقوع زلزال في عام 1759م، وقد جددت في العهد العثماني بامر من والي دمشق عثمان باشا الكرجي، وتقع في وسط الفناء وهي مجوفه مثمنه من رخام قائمه على اربعه اعمده رخاميه في وسطها انبوب ماء من النحاس يمج الماء الى الاعلى.\n\nقبه الساعات\nتقع في الجهه الشرقيه من فناء الجامع الاموي، ويعود تاريخها الى العهد العثماني، اما عن تسميتها بقبه الساعات، فيعود الى العصر العثماني الذي نقل اليها الساعات الموجوده على باب الجامع، وجعل منها مركز التوقيت.\n\nالمحاريب\nيوجد اربعه محاريب على خط جدار الحرم، واهمها محراب الصحابه الكبير الذي يقع تقريبًا في وسط الجدار. ويقع محراب صحابه النبي في النصف الشرقي. ووفقا للمهندس العباسي موسى بن شاكر، بُني المحراب الاخير خلال مرحله التشييد الاولى للمسجد، واصبح المحراب ثالث محراب متخصص في تاريخ الاسلام. وهو اقدم محراب في المسجد، حيث كان يصلي المسلمين قبل انشاء المسجد، ويسمى ايضاً محراب المالكيه. اما المحاريب الباقيه فهي:\n\nمحراب الخطيب\nمحراب الحنفيه\nمحراب الحنابله\n\nواجهه الحرم\nزُيين الفناء والحرم الشريف للجامع الاموي بواجهه فخمه تزيد المسجد فخامه ووقاراً معروفه بواجهه الحرم، وتقع في الجهه الجنوبيه من المسجد، وتطل على الفناء والذي يضم 25 باباً خشبياً تنفتح مباشره على الحرم.\nويعتقد المؤرخون ان واجهه الحرم كانت مماثله للاسلوب والنمط المعماري لبقيه الاروقه من حيث تناوب العضائد والاعمده، واعيد بناء الواجهه من غير اعمده بعد حريق وقع عام 1067، وحلَّ محل هذه الاعمده عضائد يرتفع في منتصفها كتله فخمه مازالت على وضعها الاموي الاصلي، وتتالف هذه الكتله من ثلاثه ابواب بقناطر نصف دائريه ترتكز على عضادتين يتوسطهما عمودان، وفوق هذه الابواب الثلاثه قوس كبير يحتوي ثلاثه نوافذ.\nوقد وُضِع على جانبي هذه الكتله برجان صغيران تعلوهما قبتان صغيرتان من الرصاص فوقهما ثلاث تفاحات وهلال من النحاس.\nوفي عهد الوليد كانت هذه الواجهه بما فيها مكسوّه بـالفسيفساء، سقط معظمها اثر الحرائق والزلازل التي اصابت المسجد على مدار التاريخ، وبقيت على حالها حتى الستينات من القرن الماضي حيث تمت عمليه ترميم واستصناع الفسيفساء باشراف وزاره الاوقاف والمديريه العامه للمتاحف، وكُسيت هذه الواجهه برسوم فسيفسائيه مستوحاه من الاسلوب الاموي الاصيل.\n\nقبه النسر\nهي احدى انجازات الوليد بن عبد الملك واكبر قبه في المسجد الاموي، وقد جددت هذه القبه في عهد نظام الملك وزير ملك شاه السلجوقي في عام 1075، وقام صلاح الدين الايوبي بتجديد ركنين منها في عام 1179، واستبدلت القبه الخشبيه الاصليه وبنائها من الحجر في اعقاب الحريق الذي وقع عام 1893.\nوتقع القبه فوق مركز قاعه الصلاه، بارتفاع 45 متر وقطرها 16 مترًا، وترتكز القبه على طبقه تحتيه مثمنه مع اثنين من النوافذ المقوسه على جانبيها، ودُعِمت باعمده الممرات الداخليه المركزيه.\nووصفها ابن جبير قائلا فيها:\n\nاما عن تسميتها بقبه النسر فيقول ابن جبير في كتابه احسن التقاسيم في معرفه الاقاليم:\n\nالماذن والمشاهد\nالماذن\nيحتوي المسجد الاموي على ثلاث ماذن وهي مئذنه العروس و مئذنه النبي عيسى ومئذنه قايتباي.\n\nمئذنه العروس\nتعتبر مئذنه العروس اقدم مئذنه شيدت في المسجد، وتقع في الجدار الشمالي للمسجد. لكن تاريخ تشييدها الدقيق غير معروف. اما الجزء السفلي من المئذنه يعود الى الحقبه العباسيه في القرن التاسع حسب المراجع التي وصلتنا. وقد يكون العباسيون قد بنوها فوق المئذنه الامويه القديمه، ولكن لا يوجد دليل قطعي يؤكد ان مئذنه الجدار الشمالي (مئذنه العروس) كانت جزءًا من المسجد الاصلي الذي بناه الخليفه الوليد. وقد ذكر شمس الدين المقدسي في مذكراته ان المئذنه قد شيدت في اواخر القرن العاشر الميلادي، اثناء زيارته لموقع المئذنه خلال الحكم العباسي لدمشق في عام 985م حيث وصفها انها شيدت مؤخرًا، اما الجزء العلوي من المئذنه شُيِّدَ في عام 1174. ويستخدم هذه المئذنه المؤذن للدعوه للصلاه، ويوجد درج لولبي يتكون من 160 درجه يؤدي بدوره الى غرفه المؤذن.\n\nوتنقسم مئذنه العروس الى قسمين؛ البرج الرئيسي متصل بمئذنه صغيره ثانيه من خلال ممر مسقوف ينتهي بشرفه خشبيه مضلعه يعلوها قبه صنوبريه بتفاحات وهلال دائري. تعود الى العصر المملوكي. ويعتبر البرج الرئيسي اقدم جزء من المئذنه، وهو مربع الشكل، له اربعه معارض، ويتالف من شكلين مختلفين من البناء؛ حيث تتكون القاعده من كتل كبيره، في حين بُني الجزء العلوي من الحجر. كما يوجد اثنين من فتحات الضوء بالقرب من اعلى البرج الرئيسي قبل السطح، مع اقواس على شكل حدوه الحصان مقوسنه تحت قوس واحد. وفي القرن 18 عُلِّقت مزوله اصليه تعود للقرن 14 التي بناها ابن الشاطر.\n\nمئذنه عيسى\nتقع مئذنه عيسى في الزاويه الجنوبيه الشرقيه للمسجد الاموي، ويبلغ ارتفاعها حوالي 77 متر، كما تعتبر اطول الماذن الثلاث. وتذكر بعض المصادر ان المئذنه بنيت من طرف العباسيين في القرن التاسع، بينما تعزو مصادر اخرى ان الهيكل الاصلي يعود للعهد الاموي، وقد ظلت مئدنه عيسى احدى اطول 5 بنايات بشريه لاكثر من 400 عام، ما بين القرن 8 والقرن 12 م. وتنقسم المئذنه الى قسمين متنافرين، حيث ان القسم السفلي بُنِى في العهد الايوبي في عام 1247، بينما شيد القسم العلوي في العهد العثماني. الجزء السفلي للمئذنه هو على مربع الشكل وتحتوي على نوافذ عثمانيه مقوسنه، شبيهه بنوافذ مئذنه العروس، اما الجزء العلوي فياتي مباشره وبانتقال غير متناسب هندسياً الى جذع مثمن الاضلاع عثماني الطراز، يتضمن شرفتين للمؤذن بمقرنصات خفيفه بدون مظلات ساتره، ويعلو المئذنه قلنسوه مخروطيه الشكل يعلوها ثلاث تفاحات وهلال كامل الاستداره.\nاما عن سبب تسميتها بمئذنه عيسى، فهي بسبب الاعتقاد الشعبي السائد بان النبي عيسى سينزل في اخر الزمان في هذا الموقع لمحاربه الدجال. ويدعم ابن كثير هذه الفكره، وهو احد العلماء المسلمين البارزين في القرن الرابع عشر.\n\nمئذنه قايتباي\nبنيت مئذنه قايتباي المعروفه ايضا بالمئذنه الغربيه، في عهد السلطان المملوكي قايتباي في عام 1488. وهي احد اهم المعالم الاسلاميه المصريه النموذجيه في دمشق، في الفتره المملوكيه، وتعتبر اول مئذنه شيدت في دمشق على هذا الطراز، والمئذنه هي مثمنه الشكل وتنقسم الى ثلاثه اجزاء. ويوجد اعتقاد ان مئذنه عيسى ومئذنه قايتباي بنيا فوق ابراج رومانيه قديمه، لكن بعض العلماء شككوا في صحه هذا الاعتقاد. في اكتوبر 2025، بعد مرور ما يقارب العام على سقوط نظام الاسد، اُزيل اسم حافظ الاسد الذي كان منقوشاً على مئذنه قايتباي عقب اعمال ترميم سابقه.\n\nالمشاهد\nالمشاهد هي عباره عن صالات واسعه ضمن المسجد الاموي، وقد اختلفت وظيفتها باختلاف الزمن، ويحتوي الجامع الاموي بدمشق على اربعه مشاهد تقع على يمين ويسار البابين الشرقي والغربي، وسُميت بدايهً باسماء الخلفاء الراشدين الاربعه وهي تتوزع كالتالي:\n\nمشهد ابي بكر\nيقع مشهد ابي بكر الصديق في الجهه الجنوبيه الشرقيه من المسجد الاموي ويستعمل الان كمتحف للجامع.\n\nمشهد عمر\nيقع مشهد عمر بن الخطاب في الجهه الجنوبيه الغربيه من المسجد الاموي ويستعمل الان كمقر لاداره المسجد.\n\nمشهد عثمان\nيقع مشهد الخليفه عثمان بن عفان في الجهه الشماليه الغربيه من المسجد ويستعمل الان كقاعه شرف لاستقبال كبار الضيوف.\n\nمشهد علي والحسين\nيقع مشهد الخليفه علي بن ابي طالب في الزاويه الشماليه الشرقيه من المسجد الاموي، ويحتوي على مزار ومقام راس الامام الحسين بن علي، وقد غلبت عليه تسميه مشهد الحسين.\n\nبئر الجامع\nيقع بئر الجامع في الحرم الشريف، ويقابل محراب الصحابه، ويعتبر البئر من اقدم منشات الجامع، وقد انشا في حرم الجامع قبل توسعه الوليد، وقد شُيِّد بهدف تزويد المصلين بماء الوضوء والشرب. وقد حافظ الوليد على هذا البئر واضاف اليه عمودين نفيسين مع توابعهما قدر ثمنهم بالف وخمس مئه دينار ذهبي، دفعها الوليد لخالد بن يزيد اثناء التجهيزات التي اجريت على البئر .\n\nابواب الجامع\nيحتوي المسجد الاموي على اربعه ابواب رئيسيه وهي:\n\nباب جيرون\nهو احد ابواب الجامع الاموي الاربعه، ويقع على الحائط الشرقي للجامع ويقابل حي النوفره، وهو مؤلف من ثلاث فتحات، حيث يوجد في الوسط باب كبير والى جانبيه بابان صغيران، اما عن تسميته بـ باب جيرون فتوجد عده نظريات تشرح ذلك، فالمؤرخون العرب ينسبوه الى جيرون بن سعد بن عاد، ويعتقد انه هو الذي بنى مدينه جيرون التي سميت لاحقا بدمشق، ويوجد تحليل اخر للاسم وهو لغوي مشتق من الجذر جار، وهو للدلاله على الاحياء المجاوره، ويطلق على هذا الباب الان اسم باب النوفره نسبهً لـ حي النوفره المقابل له.\n\nباب العماره/باب الكلاسه\nهو احد ابواب الجامع الاموي الاربعه، ويقع على الحائط الشمالي للجامع تحت مئذنه العروس من ناحيه العماره، وهو مؤلف من بوابه واحده تطل على صحن فناء الجامع الاموي، وقد سُمي بعده اسماء نذكر منها باب الفراديس، وباب الناطفانيين لكونه كان يطل على الحي المشهور بصناعه الناطف، ويسمى ايضا باب الكلاسه نسبه الى حي الكلاسه المقابل له، ويعرف ايضاً بباب العماره نسبهً لحي العماره القريب منه.\n\nباب بريد\nهو احد ابواب الجامع الاموي الاربعه، ويقع على الحائط الغربي للجامع مقابل ساحه المسكيه، وهو مؤلف من ثلاث فتحات، حيث يوجد في الوسط باب كبير والى جانبيه بابان صغيران، كما ان باب بريد يقابل باب جيرون، ويشرح المؤرخون العرب هذه التسميه بان بريد هو شقيق جيرون، وهو ابن عاد بن عوص بن ارم بن سام بن نوح وقد سميت البوابتان الرئيستان باسمهما، ويطلق على هذا الباب ايضا اسم باب المسكيه نسبهً لسوق المسكيه المقابل له.\n\nباب الزياده\nهو احد ابواب الجامع الاموي الاربعه، ويقع في الجهه الغربيه من الحائط الجنوبي مقابل سوق الصاغه، وهو الباب الوحيد المؤدي مباشره لحرم المسجد، وقد سُمي بهذا الاسم لكونه اُحدث زيادهً في سور المعبد عند بناء الجامع في عهد الوليد، ويعرف ايضاً باسم باب الساعات في نهايه الالفيه الاولى حيث وصفه ابن عساكر بقوله:\n\nوقد زود الجامع الاموي في كل العهود بساعه شمسيه، وساعه فلكيه، وساعات اخرى، اختلفت اشكالها واحجامها باختلاف العصور، وقد اشتهرت منها ساعه وصفها بدقه الرحاله ابن جبير قائلاً:\n\nوفي عام 1200، انتقلت هذه الساعات الى باب جيرون، وانتقلت هذه التسميه ايضاً الى باب جيرون.\nويعرف باب الزياده الان باسم باب الصاغه نسبهً لسوق الصاغه المقابل له. ويسمى ايضا بـ باب القوافين نسبه الى سوق القوافين القديم وحي القوافين الذي كان موجوداً هناك انذاك.\n\nالتاثيرات الهندسيه على المسجد\nالمسجد الاموي هو احد المساجد القليله في العالم الاسلامي التي حافظت على نفس الهيكل العام والمعالم المعماريه، منذ بنائه الاول في اوائل القرن الثامن، وطابعه الاموي لم يتغير الى حد كبير. ومنذ انشائه استعمل المسجد لتاديه صلاه الجماعه في سوريا، ووفقًا للمؤرخ فينبار باري فلوود، فان «بناء مسجد دمشق لم يغير المشهد الحضري لمدينه دمشق فقط، بل اكد اثر هيمنه العماره الامويه في العالم الاسلامي، واضاف المسجد الاموي في دمشق بعدا اخر في عماره المساجد في سوريا والعالم الاسلامي بشكل عام». ومن امثله المساجد التي تاثرت بالمسجد الاموي كنموذج اولي هي:\n\nالجامع الازهر\nمسجد بيبرس في القاهره\nالمسجد الكبير في قرطبه في اسبانيا\nالمسجد الكبير في

          "summary": "جامع بني أمية الكبير، ويعرف اختصارًا بالجامع الأموي، هو المسجد الذي أمر الوليد بن عبد الملك بتشييده في دمشق، وهو من أشهر المساجد وأفخمها، وأحد عجائب الإسلام السبعة في العالم.\nبدأ بناء الجامع الأموي في عام 705م على يد الوليد بن عبد الملك، وقد حشد له صنّاعاً من الفرس والهنود، وأوفد إمبراطور بيزنطة مئة فنان يوناني للمشاركة في التزيين، ونال قسطًا وافرًا من المدح والوصف، لا سيَّما من الرحالة والمؤرخين والأدباء الذين مرّوا بدمشق عبر العصور وأطروا بشكل خاص على زينة سقف المسجد وجدرانه الفسيفسائية الملونة، والرخام المستعمل في البناء. إلا أن أغلبها طُمس بناءً على فتاوى بعدم جوزاها حتى أُعيد اكتشافها وترميمها عام 1928. وقد وصفها المؤرخ فيليب حتي بأنها «تمثل الصناعة الأهلية السورية وليس الفن اليوناني أو البيزنطي.»\nيتميز الجامع الأموي أيضًا بكونه أول مسجد ظهر فيه المحراب والحنية نتيجة طراز البناء الذي كان يشكل كنيسة يوحنا المعمدان سابقاً. أما مئذنته الشمالية، وهي أقدم مآذنه الثلاث، فتعود لعهد الوليد بن عبد الملك. كما استخدمت أيضاً منارةً لمدينة دمشق، وكانت ستعمل خلال القرون الوسطى للمنقطين للتأمل والصلاة، ومنها انتشر نموذج المئذنة المربعة إلى سائر أنحاء سوريا وشمال إفريقيا والأندلس.\nيحتوي الجامع على مدفن جسد يوحنا المعمدان -النبي يحيى- نسيب المسيح، ولم يبقَ من آثاره المسيحية سوى جرن العماد ونقش باليونانية في مدح المسيح على أحد الجدران. كما يحوي المسجد أيضاً على الفتحة التي وضع فيها رأس الحسين بن علي حين حُمل إلى دمشق. وأُلحق بالمسجد مقبرة تضم رفات صلاح الدين الأيوبي.\nاحترقت أجزاء من الجامع ثلاث مرات: الأولى عام 1069م، والثانية على يد تيمورلنك عام 1400م، والثالثة عام 1893م. وكانت آخر عمليات الترميم في العصر الحديث عام 1994م.",

          "content": "Aleppo is the largest city in Syria and serves as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most populous governorate of Syria. With an estimated population of 2,098,000 residents as of 2021, it is Syria's largest city by urban area, and was the primary economic centre until it was surpassed by Damascus, the capital of Syria. Aleppo is also the largest city in Syria's northern governorates and one of the largest cities in the Levant region.\nAleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world; it may have been inhabited since the sixth millennium BC. Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari, just south of the old city of Aleppo, show that the area was occupied by Amorites by the latter part of the third millennium BC. That is also the time at which Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets unearthed in Ebla and Mesopotamia, which speak of it as part of the Amorite state of Yamhad, and note its commercial and military importance. Such a long history is attributed to its strategic location as a trading center between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia. For centuries, Aleppo was the largest city in the Syrian region, and the Ottoman Empire's third-largest after Constantinople (now Istanbul) and Cairo. The city's significance in history has been its location at one end of the Silk Road, which passed through Central Asia and Mesopotamia. When the Suez Canal was inaugurated in 1869, much trade was diverted to sea and Aleppo began its slow decline.\nAt the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, Aleppo lost its northern hinterland to modern Turkey, as well as the important Baghdad Railway connecting it to Mosul. In 1939, it lost its main access to the sea, by Antakya and İskenderun, also to Turkey. The growth in importance of Damascus in the past few decades further exacerbated the situation. This decline may have helped to preserve the old city of Aleppo, its medieval architecture and traditional heritage. It won the title of the Islamic Capital of Culture 2006 and has had a wave of successful restorations of its historic landmarks. The battle of Aleppo occurred in the city during the Syrian civil war, and many parts of the city suffered massive destruction. Affected parts of the city are currently undergoing reconstruction. An estimated 31,000 people were killed in Aleppo during the conflict.\n\nEtymology\nProto-Semitic Origins\nThe etymology of the name Aleppo (Arabic: Ḥalab, حلب) is ancient and rooted in the long history of the region.\nThe name Ḥalab is believed to originate from a Semitic root, possibly the Proto-Semitic root ḥlb, meaning “to milk” or “milk.” This connection might have arisen due to the area's association with pastoralism and the production of milk. Another possibility is that the name refers to the color “white,” as the root ḥlb could metaphorically describe the pale or white hue of certain local soils or materials. Similarly, the modern-day nickname al-Shahbāʾ (Arabic: الشهباء), meaning \"the white-colored mixed with black\", is said to be derived from its famed white marble.\n\nAmorite Origins and Hittite Influence\nDuring the second millennium BCE, it became a key city of the Amorite state, who referred to it as Ḥalab. The Hittites, a contemporary Anatolian Empire within the region, referred to the city as Ḥalpa or Ḥalpu in their inscriptions. This indicates the name was already well-established by this time.\n\nAramaic and Akkadian Adaptations\nIn Aramaic, the city retained a similar name, with forms like Ḥalba. Akkadian sources also refer to the city as Ḥalab.\n\nGreek and Roman Periods\nDuring the Hellenistic and Roman periods, Aleppo was known as Beroea (Βέροια in Greek), a name likely assigned by the Seleucid rulers after the Macedonian city of the same name. Despite this, the local population continued to use the original Semitic name.\n\nIslamic Period\nWith the advent of Islam and the Arabization of the region, the name Ḥalab (Arabic: حلب) remained in use, reflecting its deep historical continuity. The Arabic form also preserved its earlier meanings, with folklore often associating the name with the prophet Abraham, who is said to have “milked” his livestock in the area to provide for travelers.\n\nModern-day English\nThe adoption of “Aleppo” into English likely coincided with the Crusades (11th–13th centuries) and subsequent increased trade and travel between Europe and the Middle East. By the late 14th to early 15th centuries, the term Aleppo was well-established in English literature and travel accounts.\nThe earliest documented use of “Aleppo” in English occurs in translations of medieval texts and chronicles, such as the travel writings of Marco Polo, where the city is mentioned as a key trading hub. Additionally, it was featured in maps and documents produced during the European Renaissance as a center of commerce on the Silk Road.\n\nHistory\nPre-history and pre-classical era\nAleppo has scarcely been touched by archaeologists, since the modern city occupies its ancient site. The earliest occupation of the site was around 8,000 BC, as shown by excavations in Tallet Alsauda.\nAleppo appears in historical records as an important city much earlier than Damascus. The first record of Aleppo comes from the third millennium BC, in the Ebla tablets when Aleppo was referred to as Ha-lam (𒄩𒇴). This has been identified as an early form of Ḥalab due to an interchange of /m/ and /b/ that has been attested in Sumerian texts, including with the cuneiform sign Lam. Some historians, such as Wayne Horowitz, identify Aleppo with the capital of an independent kingdom closely related to Ebla, known as Armi, although this identification is contested. The main temple of the storm god Hadad was located on the citadel hill in the center of the city, when the city was known as the city of Hadad.\n\nNaram-Sin of Akkad mentioned his destruction of Ebla and Armanum, in the 23rd century BC. However, the identification of Armani in the inscription of Naram-Sim as Armi in the Eblaite tablets is heavily debated, as there was no Akkadian annexation of Ebla or northern Syria.\nIn the Old Babylonian and Old Assyrian Empire period, Aleppo's name appears in its original form as Ḥalab (Ḥalba) for the first time. Aleppo was the capital of the important Amorite dynasty of Yamḥad. The kingdom of Yamḥad (c. 1800–1525 BC), alternatively known as the 'land of Ḥalab,' was one of the most powerful in the Near East during the reign of Yarim-Lim I, who formed an alliance with Hammurabi of Babylonia against Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria.\n\nHittite period\nYamḥad was devastated by the Hittites under Mursili I in the 16th century BC. However, it soon resumed its leading role in the Levant when the Hittite power in the region waned due to internal strife.\nTaking advantage of the power vacuum in the region, Baratarna, king of the Hurrian kingdom of Mitanni instigated a rebellion that ended the life of Yamhad's last king Ilim-Ilimma I in c. 1525 BC, Subsequently, Parshatatar conquered Aleppo and the city found itself on the frontline in the struggle between the Mitanni, the Hittites and Egypt. Niqmepa of Alalakh who descends from the old Yamhadite kings controlled the city as a vassal to Mitanni and was attacked by Tudhaliya I of the Hittites as a retaliation for his alliance to Mitanni. Later the Hittite king Suppiluliumas I permanently defeated Mitanni, and conquered Aleppo in the 14th century BC. Suppiluliumas installed his son Telepinus as king and a dynasty of Suppiluliumas descendants ruled Aleppo until the Late Bronze Age collapse. However, Talmi-Šarruma, grandson of Suppiluliumas I, who was the king of Aleppo, had fought on the Hittite side, along with king Muwatalli II during the Battle of Kadesh against the Egyptian army led by Ramesses II.\n\nAleppo had cultic importance to the Hittites as the center of worship of the Storm-God. This religious importance continued after the collapse of the Hittite empire at the hands of the Assyrians and Phrygians in the 12th century BC, when Aleppo became part of the Middle Assyrian Empire, whose king renovated the temple of Hadad which was discovered in 2003.\nIn 2003, a statue of a king named Taita bearing inscriptions in Luwian was discovered during excavations conducted by German archeologist Kay Kohlmeyer in the Citadel of Aleppo. The new readings of Anatolian hieroglyphic signs proposed by the Hittitologists Elisabeth Rieken and Ilya Yakubovich were conducive to the conclusion that the country ruled by Taita was called Palistin. This country extended in the 11th-10th centuries BC from the Amouq Valley in the west to Aleppo in the east down to Maharda and Shaizar in the south. Due to the similarity between Palistin and Philistines, Hittitologist John David Hawkins (who translated the Aleppo inscriptions) hypothesizes a connection between the Syro-Hittite states Palistin and the Philistines, as do archaeologists Benjamin Sass and Kay Kohlmeyer. Gershon Galil suggests that King David halted the Arameans' expansion into the Land of Israel on account of his alliance with the southern Philistine kings, as well as with Toi, king of Ḥamath, who is identified with Tai(ta) II, king of Palistin (the northern Sea Peoples).\n\nState of Bit Agusi\nDuring the early years of the 1st millennium BC, Aleppo was incorporated into the Aramean realm of Bit Agusi, which held its capital at Arpad. Bit Agusi along with Aleppo and the entirety of the Levant was conquered by the Assyrians in the 8th century BC and became part of the Neo-Assyrian Empire during the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III until the late 7th century BC, before passing through the hands of the Neo-Babylonians and the Achaemenid Persians. The region remained known as Aramea and Eber Nari throughout these periods.\n\nClassical antiquity (Beroea)\nAlexander the Great took over the city in 333 BC. Seleucus Nicator established a Hellenic settlement in the site between 301 and 286 BC. He called it Beroea (Βέροια), after Beroea in Macedon; it is sometimes spelled as Beroia. Beroea is mentioned in 1 Macc. 9:4.\nNorthern Syria was the center of gravity of the Hellenistic world and Greek culture in the Seleucid Empire. As did other Greek cities of the Seleucid kingdom, Beroea probably enjoyed a measure of local autonomy, with a local civic assembly or boulē composed of free Hellenes.\nBeroea remained under Seleucid rule until 88 BC when Syria was conquered by the Armenian king Tigranes the Great and Beroea became part of the Kingdom of Armenia. After the Roman victory over Tigranes, Syria was handed over to Pompey in 64 BC, at which time they became a Roman province. Rome's presence afforded relative stability in northern Syria for over three centuries. Although the province was administered by a legate from Rome, Rome did not impose its administrative organization on the Greek-speaking ruling class or Aramaic speaking populace.\nThe Roman era saw an increase in the population of northern Syria that accelerated under the Byzantines well into the 5th century. In Late Antiquity, Beroea was the second largest Syrian city after Antioch, the capital of Roman Syria and the third largest city in the Roman world. Archaeological evidence indicates a high population density for settlements between Antioch and Beroea right up to the 6th century. This agrarian landscape still holds the remains of large estate houses and churches such as the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites.\n\nEcclesiastical history\nThe names of several bishops of the episcopal see of Beroea, which was in the Roman province of Syria Prima, are recorded in extant documents. The first whose name survives is that of Saint Eustathius of Antioch, who, after being bishop of Beroea, was transferred to the important metropolitan see of Antioch shortly before the 325 First Council of Nicaea. His successor in Beroea Cyrus was for his fidelity to the Nicene faith sent into exile by the Roman Emperor Constantius II. After the Council of Seleucia of 359, called by Constantius, Meletius of Antioch was transferred from Sebastea to Beroea but in the following year was promoted to Antioch. His successor in Beroea, Anatolius, was at a council in Antioch in 363. Under the persecuting Emperor Valens, the bishop of Beroea was Theodotus, a friend of Basil the Great. He was succeeded by Acacius of Beroea, who governed the see for over 50 years and was at the First Council of Constantinople in 381 and the Council of Ephesus in 431. In 438, he was succeeded by Theoctistus, who participated in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 and was a signatory of the joint letter that the bishops of the province of Syria Prima sent in 458 to Emperor Leo I the Thracian about the murder of Proterius of Alexandria. In 518, Emperor Justin I exiled the bishop of Beroea Antoninus for rejecting the Council of Chalcedon. The last known bishop of the see is Megas, who was at a synod called by Patriarch Menas of Constantinople in 536. After the Arab conquest, Beroea ceased to be a residential bishopric, and is today listed by the Roman Catholic Church as a titular see.\nVery few physical remains have been found from the Roman and Byzantine periods in the Citadel of Aleppo. The two mosques inside the Citadel are known to have been converted by the Mirdasids during the 11th century from churches originally built by the Byzantines.\n\nMedieval period\nEarly Islamic period\nThe Sasanian Persians led by King Khosrow I pillaged and burned Aleppo in 540, then they invaded and controlled Syria briefly in the early 7th century. Soon after Aleppo was taken by the Rashidun Muslims under Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah in 637. It later became part of Jund Qinnasrin under the Umayyad Caliphate. In 944, it became the seat of an independent Emirate under the Hamdanid prince Sayf al-Dawla, and enjoyed a period of great prosperity, being home to the great poet al-Mutanabbi and the philosopher and polymath al-Farabi. In 962, the city was sacked by the Byzantine general Nikephoros Phokas. Subsequently, the city and its emirate became a temporary vassal of the Byzantine Empire. For the next few decades, the city was disputed by the Fatimid Caliphate and Byzantine Empire, with the nominally independent Hamdanids in between, eventually falling to the Fatimids in 1017. In 1024, Salih ibn Mirdas launched an attack on Fatimid Aleppo, and after a few months was invited into the city by its population. The Mirdasid dynasty then ruled the city until 1080, interrupted only in 1038–1042, when it was in the hands of the Fatimid commander-in-chief in Syria, Anushtakin al-Dizbari, and in 1057–1060, when it was ruled by a Fatimid governor, Ibn Mulhim. Mirdasid rule was marked by internal squabbles between different Mirdasid chieftains that sapped the emirate's power and made it susceptible to external intervention by the Byzantines, Fatimids, Uqaylids, and Turkoman warrior bands.\n\nSeljuq and Ayyubid periods\nIn late 1077, Seljuk emir Tutush I launched a campaign to capture Aleppo during the reign of Sabiq ibn Mahmud of the Mirdasid dynasty, which lasted until 1080, when his reinforcements were ambushed and routed by a coalition of Arab tribesmen led by Kilabi chief Abu Za'ida at Wadi Butnan. After the death of Sharaf al-Dawla of the Uqaylid dynasty in June 1085, the headman in Aleppo Sharif Hassan ibn Hibat Allah Al-Hutayti promised to surrender the city to Sultan Malik-Shah I. When the latter delayed his arrival, Hassan contacted the Sultan's brother Tutush. However, after Tutush defeated Suleiman ibn Qutulmish, who had intended to take Aleppo for himself, in the battle of Ain Salm, Hassan went back on his commitment. In response, Tutush attacked the city and managed to get hold of parts of the walls and towers in July 1086, but he left in September, either due to the advance of Malik-Shah or because the Fatimids were besieging Damascus. In 1087, Aq Sunqur al-Hajib became the Seljuk governor of Aleppo under Sultan Malik Shah I. During his bid for the Seljuk throne, Tutush had Aq Sunqur executed and after Tutush died in battle, the town was ruled by his son Ridwan.\nThe city was besieged by Crusaders led by the King of Jerusalem Baldwin II in 1124–1125, but was not conquered after receiving protection by forces of Aqsunqur al Bursuqi arriving from Mosul in January 1125.\nIn 1128, Aleppo became capital of the expanding Zengid dynasty, which ultimately conquered Damascus in 1154. In 1138, Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos led a campaign, which main objective was to capture the city of Aleppo. On 20 April 1138, the Christian army including Crusaders from Antioch and Edessa launched an attack on the city but found it too strongly defended, hence John II moved the army southward to take nearby fortresses. On 11 October 1138, a deadly earthquake ravaged the city and the surrounding area. Although estimates from this time are very unreliable, it is believed that 230,000 people died, making it the seventh deadliest earthquake in recorded history.\nIn 1183, Aleppo came under the control of Saladin and then the Ayyubid dynasty. When the Ayyubids were toppled in Egypt by the Mamluks, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo An-Nasir Yusuf became sultan of the remaining part of the Ayyubid Empire. He ruled Syria from his seat in Aleppo until, on 24 January 1260, the city was taken by the Mongols under Hulagu in alliance with their vassals the Frankish knights of the ruler of Antioch Bohemond VI and his father-in-law the Armenian ruler Hethum I. The city was poorly defended by Turanshah, and as a result the walls fell after six days of siege, and the citadel fell four weeks later. The Muslim population was massacred and many Jews were also killed. The Christian population was spared. Turanshah was shown unusual respect by the Mongols, and was allowed to live because of his age and bravery. The city was then given to the former Emir of Homs, al-Ashraf, and a Mongol garrison was established in the city. Some of the spoils were also given to Hethum I for his assistance in the attack. The Mongol Army then continued on to Damascus, which surrendered, and the Mongols entered the city on 1 March 1260.\n\nMamluk period\nIn September 1260, the Egyptian Mamluks negotiated for a treaty with the Franks of Acre which allowed them to pass through Crusader territory unmolested, and engaged the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut on 3 September 1260. The Mamluks won a decisive victory, killing the Mongols' Nestorian Christian general Kitbuqa, and five days later they had retaken Damascus. Aleppo was recovered by the Muslims within a month, and a Mamluk governor placed to govern the city. Hulagu sent troops to try to recover Aleppo in December. They were able to massacre a large number of Muslims in retaliation for the death of Kitbuqa, but after a fortnight could make no other progress and had to retreat.\n\nThe Mamluk governor of the city became insubordinate to the central Mamluk authority in Cairo, and in Autumn 1261 the Mamluk leader Baibars sent an army to reclaim the city. In October 1271, the Mongols led by general Samagar took the city again, attacking with 10,000 horsemen from Anatolia, and defeating the Turcoman troops who were defending Aleppo. The Mamluk garrisons fled to Hama, until Baibars came north again with his main army, and the Mongols retreated.\nOn 20 October 1280, the Mongols took the city again, pillaging the markets and burning the mosques. The Muslim inhabitants fled for Damascus, where the Mamluk leader Qalawun assembled his forces. When his army advanced following the Second Battle of Homs in October 1281, the Mongols again retreated, back across the Euphrates. In October 1299, Ghazan captured the city, joined by his vassal Armenian King Hethum II, whose forces included some Templars and Hospitallers.\nIn 1400, the Mongol-Turkic leader Tamerlane captured the city again from the Mamluks. He massacred many of the inhabitants, ordering the building of a tower of 20,000 skulls outside the city. After the withdrawal of the Mongols, all the Muslim population returned to Aleppo. On the other hand, Christians who left the city during the Mongol invasion, were unable to resettle back in their own quarter in the old town, a fact that led them to establish a new neighbourhood in 1420, built at the northern suburbs of Aleppo outside the city walls, to become known as al-Jdeydeh quarter (\"new district\" Arabic: جديدة).\n\nOttoman era\nAleppo became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1516 as part of the vast expansion of the Ottoman borders during the reign of Selim I. The city then had around 50,000 inhabitants, or 11,224 households according to an Ottoman census. In 1517, Selim I obtained a fatwa from Sunnite religious leaders and unleashed violence on the Alawites, killing 9,400 men, which is known as the Massacre of the Telal. It was the centre of the Aleppo Eyalet; the rest of what later became Syria was part of either the eyalets of Damascus, Tripoli, Sidon or Raqqa. Following the Ottoman provincial reform of 1864 Aleppo became the centre of the newly constituted Vilayet of Aleppo in 1866.\nAleppo's agriculture was well-developed in the Ottoman period. Archaeological excavations revealed water mills in its river basin. Contemporary Chinese source also suggests Aleppo in the Ottoman period had well-developed animal husbandry.\nDuring his travels to the Levant in the 17th century, French traveler Jacques Goujon recounted how the Maronite community in Aleppo, facing financial difficulties and considering conversion to Islam due to their inability to pay the jizya tax, was aided by the Franciscans who bought their church, enabling them to meet their tax obligations.\nMoreover, thanks to its strategic geographic location on the trade route between Anatolia and the east, Aleppo rose to high prominence in the Ottoman era, at one point being second only to Constantinople in the empire. By the middle of the 16th century, Aleppo had displaced Damascus as the principal market for goods coming to the Mediterranean region from the east. This is reflected by the fact that the Levant Company of London, a joint-trading company founded in 1581 to monopolize England's trade with the Ottoman Empire, never attempted to settle a factor, or agent, in Damascus, despite having had permission to do so. Aleppo served as the company's headquarters until the late 18th century.\n\nAs a result of the economic development, many European states had opened consulates in Aleppo during the 16th and the 17th centuries, such as the consulate of the Republic of Venice in 1548, the consulate of France in 1562, the consulate of England in 1583 and the consulate of the Netherlands in 1613. The Armenian community of Aleppo also rose to prominence in this period as they moved into the city to take up trade and developed the new quarter of Judayda. The most outstanding among Aleppine Armenian merchants during the late 16th and early 17th centuries were Khwaja Petik Chelebi, the richest merchant in the city, and his brother Khwaja Sanos Chelebi, who monopolized Aleppine silk trade and were important patrons of the Armenians.\n\nHowever, the prosperity Aleppo experienced in the 16th and 17th century started to fade as silk production in Iran went into decline with the fall of the Safavid dynasty in 1722. By mid-century, caravans were no longer bringing silk from Iran to Aleppo, and local Syrian production was insufficient for Europe's demand. European merchants left Aleppo and the city went into an economic decline that was not reversed until the mid-19th century when locally produced cotton and tobacco became the principal commodities of interest to the Europeans. According to Halil İnalcık, \"Aleppo ... underwent its worst catastrophe with the wholesale destruction of its villages by Bedouin raiding in the later years of the century, creating a long-running famine which by 1798 killed half of its inhabitants.\"\nThe economy of Aleppo was badly hit by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. This, in addition to political instability that followed the implementation of significant reforms in 1841 by the central government, contributed to Aleppo's decline and the rise of Damascus as a serious economic and political competitor with Aleppo. The city nevertheless continued to play an important economic role and shifted its commercial focus from long-distance caravan trade to more regional trade in wool and agricultural products. This period also saw the immigration of numerous \"Levantine\" (European-origin) families who dominated international trade. Aleppo's mixed commercial tribunal (ticaret mahkamesi), one of the first in the Ottoman Empire, was set up around 1855.\n\nReference is made to the city in 1606 in William Shakespeare's Macbeth. The witches torment the captain of the ship the Tiger, which was headed to Aleppo from England and endured a 567-day voyage before returning unsuccessfully to port. Reference is also made to the city in Shakespeare's Othello when Othello speaks his final words (ACT V, ii, 349f.): \"Set you down this/And say besides that in Aleppo once,/Where a malignant and a turbanned Turk/Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,/I took by th' throat the circumcised dog/And smote him—thus!\" (Arden Shakespeare Edition, 2004). The English naval chaplain Henry Teonge describes in his diary a visit he paid to the city in 1675, when there was a colony of Western European merchants living there.\n\nThe city remained under Ottoman rule until the empire's collapse, but was occasionally riven with internal feuds as well as attacks of cholera from 1823. Around 20–25 percent of the population died of plague in 1827. In 1850, a Muslim mob attacked Christian neighbourhoods, tens of Christians were killed and several churches looted. Though this event has been portrayed as driven by pure sectarian principles, Bruce Masters argues that such analysis of this period of violence is too shallow and neglects the tensions that existed among the population due to the commercial favor afforded to certain Christian minorities by the Tanzimat Reforms during this time which played a large role in creating antagonism between previously cooperative groups of Muslim and Christians in the eastern quarters of the city. By 1901, the city's population was around 110,000.\nIn October 1918, Aleppo was captured by Prince Feisal's Sherifial Forces and the 5th Cavalry Division of the Allied forces from the Ottoman Empire during the World War I. At the end of war, the Treaty of Sèvres made most of the Vilayet of Aleppo, including the cities of Urfa, Marash, and Aintab, part of the newly established nation of Syria. However, Kemal Atatürk annexed most of the Vilayet of Aleppo as well as Allied-controlled Cilicia to Turkey in his War of Independence. The Muslim Arab and Kurdish residents in the province supported the Turks in this war against the French, including the leader of the Hananu Revolt, Ibrahim Hananu, who directly coordinated with Atatürk and received weaponry from him. The outcome, however, was disastrous for Aleppo, because as per the Treaty of Lausanne, most of the vilayet was made part of Turkey with the exception of Aleppo and Alexandretta; thus Aleppo was cut from its northern satellites which connected it to the Anatolian cities beyond on which Aleppo depended heavily in commerce. Moreover, the Sykes-Picot division of the Near East separated Aleppo from most of Mesopotamia, including its twin city of Mosul, which also harmed the economy of Aleppo. The outcome of these newly created borders was epochal, as they redirected Syria's would-be capital from Aleppo to Damascus.\n\nFrench mandate\nThe State of Aleppo was declared by French General Henri Gouraud in September 1920 as part of a French plan to make Syria easier to administer by dividing it into several smaller states. France became more concerned about the idea of a united Syria after the Battle of Maysaloun.\nBy separating Aleppo from Damascus, Gouraud wanted to capitalize on a traditional state of competition between the two cities and turn it into political division. The people in Aleppo were unhappy with the fact that Damascus was chosen as capital for the new nation of Syria. Gouraud sensed this sentiment and tried to address it by making Aleppo the capital of a large and wealthier state with which it would have been hard for Damascus to compete. The State of Aleppo as drawn by France contained most of the fertile area of Syria: the fertile countryside of Aleppo in addition to the entire fertile basin of river Euphrates. The state also had access to sea via the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta. On the other hand, Damascus, which is basically an oasis on the fringes of the Syrian Desert, had neither enough fertile land nor access to sea. Basically, Gouraud wanted to satisfy Aleppo by giving it control over most of the agricultural and mineral wealth of Syria so that it would never want to unite with Damascus again. Damascus's relative economic weakness was further exacerbated by the economic success of Beirut during the 1920s, a territory part of the larger French Mandate at the time.\n\nThe limited economic resources of the Syrian states made the option of completely independent states undesirable for France, because it threatened an opposite result: the states collapsing and being forced back into unity. This was why France proposed the idea of a Syrian federation that was realized in 1923. Initially, Gouraud envisioned the federation as encompassing all the states, even Lebanon. In the end however, only three states participated: Aleppo, Damascus, and the Alawite State. The capital of the federation was Aleppo at first, but it was relocated to Damascus. The president of the federation was Subhi Barakat, an Antioch-born politician from Aleppo.\n\nThe federation ended in December 1924, when France merged Aleppo and Damascus into a single Syrian State and separated the Alawite State again. This action came after the federation decided to merge the three federated states into one and to take steps encouraging Syria's financial independence, steps which France viewed as too much.\n\nWhen the Syrian Revolt erupted in southern Syria in 1925, the French held in Aleppo State new elections that were supposed to lead to the breaking of the union with Damascus and restore the independence of Aleppo State. The French were driven to believe by pro-French Aleppine politicians that the people in Aleppo were supportive of such a scheme. After the new council was elected, however, it surprisingly voted to keep the union with Damascus. Syrian nationalists had waged a massive anti-secession public campaign that vigorously mobilized the people against the secession plan, thus leaving the pro-French politicians no choice but to support the union. The result was a big embarrassment for France, which wanted the secession of Aleppo to be a punitive measure against Damascus, which had participated in the Syrian Revolt, however, the result was respected. This was the last time that independence was proposed for Aleppo.\nBad economic situation of the city after the separation of the northern countryside was exacerbated further in 1939 when Alexandretta was annexed to Turkey as Hatay State, thus depriving Aleppo of its main port of Iskenderun and leaving it in total isolation within Syria.\n\nPost-independence\nThe increasing disagreements between Aleppo and Damascus led eventually to the split of the National Block into two factions: the National Party, established in Damascus in 1946, and the People's Party, established in Aleppo in 1948 by Rushdi al-Kikhya, Nazim Qudsi and Mustafa Bey Barmada. An underlying cause of the disagreement, in addition to the union with Iraq, was Aleppo's intention to relocate the capital from Damascus. The issue of the capital became an open debate matter in 1950 when the Popular Party presented a constitution draft that called Damascus a \"temporary capital.\"\n\nThe first coup d'état in modern Syrian history was carried out in March 1949 by an army officer from Aleppo, Hussni Zaim. However, lured by the absolute power he enjoyed as a dictator, Zaim soon developed a pro-Egyptian, pro-Western orientation and abandoned the cause of union with Iraq. This incited a second coup only four months after his. The second coup, led by Sami Hinnawi (also officer from Aleppo), empowered the Popular Party and actively sought to realize the union with Iraq. The news of an imminent union with Iraq incited a third coup the same year: in December 1949, Adib Shishakly led a coup preempting a union with Iraq that was about to be declared.\n\nSoon after Shishakly's domination ended in 1954, a union with Egypt under Gamal Abdul Nasser was implemented in 1958. The union, however, collapsed three and a half years later when a junta of young Damascene officers carried out a separatist coup. Aleppo resisted the separatist coup, but eventually it had no choice but to recognize the new government.\n\nIn March 1963 a coalition of Baathists, Nasserists, and Socialists launched a new coup whose declared objective was to restore the union with Egypt. However, the new government only restored the flag of the union. Soon thereafter disagreement between the Baathists and the Nasserists over the restoration of the union became a crisis, and the Baathists ousted the Nasserists from power. The Nasserists, most of whom were from the Aleppine middle class, responded with an insurgency in Aleppo in July 1963.\nAgain, the Ba'ath government tried to absorb the dissent of the Syrian middle class (whose center of political activism was Aleppo) by putting to the front Amin al-Hafiz, a Baathist military officer from Aleppo.\n\nPresident Hafez al-Assad, who came to power in 1970, relied on support from the business class in Damascus. This gave Damascus further advantage over Aleppo, and hence Damascus came to dominate the Syrian economy. The strict centralization of the Syrian state, the intentional direction of resources towards Damascus, and the hegemony Damascus enjoys over the Syrian economy made it increasingly hard for Aleppo to compete. Despite this, Aleppo remained a nationally important economic and cultural center.\n\nOn 16 June 1979, thirty-two military cadets were massacred by antigovernmental Islamist rebel group Muslim Brotherhood. In the subsequent violence around fifty people were killed. On 10 July a further twenty-two Syrian soldiers were killed. Both terrorist attacks were part of the Islamist uprising in Syria. In 1980, events escalated into the a large-scale military operation in Aleppo, where Syrian government responded with military and security forces, sending in tens of thousands of troops backed by tanks, armored vehicles and helicopters. Several hundred rebels were killed in and around city and eight thousand were arrested. By February 1981, the Islamist uprising in the city of Aleppo was suppressed.\nSince the late 1990s, Aleppo has become one of the fastest growing cities in the Levant and the Middle East. The opening of the industrial city of Shaykh Najjar and the influx of new investments and flow of the new industries after 2004 also contributed to the development of the city. In 2006, Aleppo was named by the Islamic Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO) as the capital of Islamic culture.\nBefore the Syrian civil war, Aleppo was the third largest city in the Middle East after Cairo and Beirut in terms of the number of Christians.\n\nSyrian civil war\nOn 12 August 2011, some months after protests had begun elsewhere in Syria, anti-government protests were held in several districts of Aleppo, including the city's Sakhour district. During this demonstration, which included tens of thousands of protesters, security forces shot and killed at least twelve people. Two months later, a pro-government demonstration was held in Saadallah Al-Jabiri Square, in the heart of the city. According to the New York Times, the 11 October 2011 rally in support of Bashar al-Assad was attended by large crowds, while state and local media claimed more than 1.5 million attended and stated that it was one of the largest rallies ever held in Syria.\nIn early 2012, rebels began bombing Aleppo after the spread of anti-government protests. On 10 February 2012, suicide car bombs exploded outside two security compounds — the Military Intelligence Directorate's local headquarters, and a Syrian Internal Security Forces barracks — reportedly killing 28 (four civilians, thirteen military personnel and eleven security personnel) and wounding 235. On 18 March 2012, another car bomb blast in a residential neighbourhood reportedly killed two security personnel and one female civilian, and wounded 30 residents.\n\nIn late July 2012, the conflict reached Aleppo in earnest when rebels in the city's surrounding countryside mounted their first offensive there, apparently trying to capitalise on momentum gained during the Damascus assault. Then, some of the civil war's \"most devastating bombing and fiercest fighting\" took place in Aleppo, often in residential areas. In the summer, autumn and winter of 2012 house-to-house fighting between armed opposition and government forces continued, and by the spring 2013 the Syrian Army had entrenched itself in the western part of Aleppo (government loyalist forces were operating from a military base in the southern part of the city) and the Free Syrian Army in the eastern part with a no man's land between them. One estimate of casualties by an international humanitarian organization is that by this time 13,500 had been killed in the fighting — 1,500 under 5 years of age — and that another 23,000 had been injured. Local police stations in the city, used as bases of government forces and hated and feared by residents, were a focus of much of the conflict.\n\nAs a result of the severe battle, many sections in Al-Madina Souq (part of the Old City of Aleppo World Heritage Site), including parts of the Great Mosque of Aleppo and other medieval buildings in the ancient city, were destroyed and ruined or burnt in late summer 2012 as the armed groups of the Syrian Arab Army and the Free Syrian Army fought for control of the city. By March 2013, a majority of Aleppo's factory owners transferred their goods to Turkey with the full knowledge and facilitation of the Turkish government.\nA stalemate that had been in place for four years ended in July 2016, when Syrian Army troops closed the last supply line of the rebels into Aleppo with the support of Russian airstrikes. In response, rebel forces launched unsuccessful counter-offensives in September and October that failed to break the siege; in November, government forces embarked on a decisive campaign. The rebels agreed to evacuate from their remaining areas in December 2016. Syrian government victory with Russian aerial bombardment was widely seen as a potential turning point in Syria's civil war. On 22 December, the evacuation was completed with the Syrian Army declaring it had taken complete control of the city. Red Cross later confirmed that the evacuation of all civilians and rebels was complete.\nWhen the battle ended, 500,000 refugees and internally displaced persons returned to Aleppo, and Syrian state media said that hundreds of factories returned to production as electricity supply greatly increased. Many parts of the city that were affected are undergoing reconstruction. On 15 April 2017, a convoy of buses carrying evacuees was attacked by a suicide bomber in Aleppo, killing more than 126 people, including at least 80 children. Syrian state media reported that the Aleppo shopping festival took place on 17 November 2017 to promote industry in the city. A YPG commander stated in February 2018 that Kurdish fighters had shifted to Afrin to help repel the Turkish assault. As a result, he said the pro-Syrian government forces had regained control of the districts previously controlled by them. In February 2020, government forces achieved a major breakthrough when they captured the last remaining rebel-held areas in Aleppo's western periphery, thus decisively ending the clashes that began with the Battle of Aleppo over eight years prior.\nThe city suffered damage due to the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake.\n\nTakeover by Syrian opposition\nOn 29 November 2024, Syrian opposition groups, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, captured the city during the Battle of Aleppo  as part of the offensive in northwestern Syria.\n\nGeography\nAleppo lies about 120 km (75 mi) inland from the Mediterranean Sea, on a plateau 380 m (1,250 ft) above sea level, 45 km (28 mi) east of the Syrian-Turkish border checkpoint of Bab al-Hawa. The city is surrounded by farmlands from the north and the west, widely cultivated with olive and pistachio trees. To the east, Aleppo approaches the dry areas of the Syrian Desert.\n\nThe city was founded a few kilometres south of the location of the current old city, on the right bank of Queiq River which arises from the Aintab plateau in the north and runs through Aleppo southward to the fertile country of Qinnasrin. The old city of Aleppo lies on the left bank of the Queiq. It was surrounded by a circle of eight hills surrounding a prominent central hill on which the castle (originally a temple dating to the 2nd millennium BC) was erected. The radius of the circle is about 10 km (6.2 mi). The hills are Tell as-Sawda, Tell ʕāysha, Tell as-Sett, Tell al-Yāsmīn (Al-ʕaqaba), Tell al-Ansāri (Yārūqiyya), ʕan at-Tall, al-Jallūm, Baḥsīta. The old city was enclosed within an ancient wall that was last rebuilt by the Mamluks. The wall has since disappeared. It had nine gates and was surrounded by a broad deep ditch.\nOccupying an area of more than 190 km2 (73 sq mi), Aleppo is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Middle East. According to the new major plan of the city adopted in 2001, it is envisaged to increase the total area of Aleppo up to 420 km2 (160 sq mi) by the end of 2015.\n\nClimate\nAleppo has a hot steppe climate (Köppen: BSh). The mountain series that run along the Mediterranean coast, namely the Alawiyin Mountains and the Nur Mountains, largely block the effects of the Mediterranean on climate (rain shadow effect). The average high and low temperature throughout the year is 23.8 and 11.1 °C (74.8 and 52.0 °F). The average precipitation is 329.4 mm (12.97 in). More than 80% of precipitation occurs between October and March. It snows once or twice every winter. Average humidity is 55.7%.\n\nArchitecture\nAleppo is characterized with mixed architectural styles, having been ruled by, among others, Romans, Byzantines, Seljuqs, Mamluks and Ottomans.\n\nVarious types of 13th and 14th centuries constructions, such as caravanserais, caeserias, Quranic schools, hammams and religious buildings are found in the old city. The quarters of al-Jdayde district are home to numerous 16th and 17th-century houses of the Aleppine bourgeoisie, featuring stone engravings. Baroque architecture of the 19th and early 20th centuries is common in al-Azizyah district, including the Villa Rose. The new Shahbaa district is a mixture of several styles, such as Neo-classic, Norman, Oriental and even Chinese architecture.\nSince the old city is characterized with its large mansions, narrow alleys and covered souqs, the modern city's architecture has replenished the town with wide roads and large squares such as the Saadallah Al-Jabiri Square, the Liberty Square, the President's Square and Sabaa Bahrat Square\n\nThere is a relatively clear division between old and new Aleppo. The older portions of the city, with an approximate area of 160 ha (0.6 sq mi) are contained within a wall, 5 km (3.1 mi) in circuit with nine gates. The huge medieval castle in the city — known as the Citadel of Aleppo — occupies the center of the ancient part, in the shape of an acropolis.\nBeing subjected to constant invasions and political instability, the inhabitants of the city were forced to build cell-like quarters and districts that were socially and economically independent. Each district was characterized by the religious and ethnic characteristics of its inhabitants.\nThe mainly white-stoned old town was built within the historical walls of the city, pierced by the nine historical gates, while the newer quarters of the old city were first built by the Christians during the early 15th century in the northern suburbs of the ancient city, after the Mongol withdrawal from Aleppo. The new quarter known as al-Jdayde is one of the finest examples of a cell-like quarter in Aleppo. After Tamerlane invaded Aleppo in 1400 and destroyed it, the Christians migrated out of the city walls and established their own cell in 1420, at the northwestern suburbs of the city, thus founding the quarters of al-Jdayde. The inhabitants of the new quarters were mainly brokers who facilitated trade between foreign traders and local merchants. As a result of the economic development, many other quarters were established outside the walls of the ancient city during the 15th and 16th centuries.\nThus, the Old City of Aleppo — composed of the ancient city within the walls and the old cell-like quarters outside the walls — has an approximate area of 350 ha (1.4 sq mi) housing more than 120,000 residents.\n\nDemographics\nHistorical population\nAccording to the Aleppine historian Sheikh Kamel Al-Ghazzi (1853–1933), the population of Aleppo was around 400,000 before the disastrous earthquake of 1822. Followed by cholera and plague attacks in 1823 and 1827 respectively, the population of the city declined to 110,000 by the end of the 19th century. In 1901, the total population of Aleppo was 108,143 of which Muslims were 76,329 (70.58%), Christians — mostly Catholics — 24,508 (22.66%) and Jews 7,306 (6.76%).\nAleppo's large Christian population swelled with the influx of Armenian and Assyrian Christian refugees during the early 20th-century and after the Armenian and Assyrian genocides of 1915. After the arrival of the first groups of Armenian refugees (1915–1922) the population of Aleppo in 1922 counted 156,748 of which Muslims were 97,600 (62.26%), native Christians — mostly Catholics —  22,117 (14.11%), Jews 6,580 (4.20%), Europeans 2,652 (1.70%), Armenian refugees 20,007 (12.76%) and others 7,792 (4.97%). However, even though a large majority of the Armenians arrived during the period, the city has had an Armenian community since at least the 1100s, when a considerable number of Armenian families and merchants from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia settled in the city. The oldest Armenian church in the city is from 1491 as well, which indicates that they have been there long before.\nThe second period of Armenian flow towards Aleppo marked with the withdrawal of the French troops from Cilicia in 1923. After the arrival of more than 40,000 Armenian refugees between 1923 and 1925, the population of the city reached up to 210,000 by the end of 1925, of which more than a quarter were Armenians.\nAccording to the historical data presented by Al-Ghazzi, the vast majority of the Aleppine Christians were Catholics until the latter days of the Ottoman rule. The growth of the Oriental Orthodox Christians is related with the arrival of the Assyrian survivors from Cilicia and Southern Turkey, while on the other hand, large numbers of Eastern Orthodox Christians from the Sanjak of Alexandretta arrived in Aleppo, after the annexation of the Sanjak in 1939 in favour of Turkey.\n\nIn 1944, Aleppo's population was around 325,000, with 112,110 (34.5%) Christians among which Armenians numbered 60,200. Armenians formed more than half of the Christian community in Aleppo until 1947, when many groups of them left for Soviet Armenia within the frames of the Armenian Repatriation Process (1946–1967).\n\nPre-civil war status\nAleppo was the most populous city in Syria, with a population of 2,132,100 as indicated in the latest official census in 2004 by the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Its subdistrict (nahiya) consisted of 23 localities with a collective population of 2,181,061 in 2004. According to the official estimate announced by the Aleppo City Council, the population of the city was 2,301,570 by the end of 2005. As a result of the Syrian civil war, however, the city eastern half's population under the control of the opposition had plummeted to an estimated 40,000 by 2015.\n\nMuslims\nMore than 80% of Aleppo's inhabitants are Sunni Muslims. They are mainly Syrian Arabs, followed by Turkmens and Kurds. Other Muslim groups include small numbers of ethnic Circassians, Chechens, Albanians, Bosniaks, Greeks and Bulgarians.\n\nChristians\nUntil the beginning of the Battle of Aleppo in 2012, the city contained one of the largest Christian communities in the Middle East. There were many Oriental Orthodox Christian congregations, mainly Armenians and Assyrians (locally known as Syriacs). Historically, the city was the main centre of French Catholic missionaries in Syria.\nThe Christian population of Aleppo was slightly more than 250,000 before the Syrian civil war, representing about 12% of the total population of the city. However, as a consequence of the war, the Christian population of the city decreased to less than 100,000 as of the beginning of 2017, of whom around 30% were ethnic Armenians.\nA significant number of the Assyrians in Aleppo speak Aramaic, hailing from the city of Urfa in Turkey. The large community of Oriental Orthodox Christians belongs to the Armenian Apostolic and Syriac Orthodox churches. However, there is a significant presence of the Eastern Orthodox Church of Antioch as well.\nThere is also a large number Eastern Catholic Christians in the city, including Melkite Greeks, Maronites, Chaldeans, Syrian Catholics and the followers of the Latin Church. Evangelical Christians of different denominations are a minority in the city.\nSeveral districts of the city have a Christian and Armenian majority, such as the old Christian quarter of al-Jdayde. Around 50 churches are operated in the city by the above-mentioned congregations. However, according to the Deputy Chairman of the commission for UNESCO of the Russian Federation, Alexander Dzasokhov, around 20 churches suffered great destruction during the battles in Aleppo, with the most notable being the National Evangelical Church, as well as the surrounding historic churches of al-Jdayde district. On 25 December 2016, following the government victory, Christmas was publicly celebrated in Aleppo for the first time in four years.\n\nJews\nThe city was home to a significant Jewish population from ancient times. The Great Synagogue, built in the 5th century, housed the Aleppo Codex. In the 12th century, Benjamin of Tudela recorded that the Jewish community in Aleppo consisted of 5,000 people, calling it one of the largest communities in Bilād al-Shām.\nThe Jews of Aleppo were known for their religious commitment, Rabbinic leadership, and their liturgy, consisting of Pizmonim and Baqashot. After the Spanish Inquisition, the city of Aleppo received many Sephardic Jewish immigrants, who eventually joined with the native Aleppo Jewish community. Peaceful relations existed between the Jews and surrounding population. In the early 20th century, the town's Jews lived mainly in Al-Jamiliyah, Bab Al-Faraj and the neighbourhoods around the Great Synagogue. Unrest in Palestine in the years preceding the establishment of Israel in 1948 resulted in growing hostility towards Jews living in Arab countries, culminating in the Jewish exodus from Arab lands. In December 1947, after the UN decided the partition of Palestine, an Arab mob attacked the Jewish quarter. Homes, schools and shops were badly damaged. Soon after, many of the town's remaining 6,000 Jews emigrated. In 1968, there were an estimated 700 Jews still remaining in Aleppo.\nThe houses and other properties of the Jewish families which were not sold after the migration, remain uninhabited under the protection of the Syrian Government. Most of these properties are in Al-Jamiliyah and Bab Al-Faraj areas, and the neighbourhoods around the Central Synagogue of Aleppo. In 1992, the Syrian government lifted the travel ban on its 4,500 Jewish citizens. Most traveled to the United States, where a sizable number of Syrian Jews currently live in Brooklyn, New York. The last Jews of Aleppo, the Halabi family, were evacuated from the city in October 2016 by the Free Syrian Army and now live in Israel.\nThe Jews from Aleppo referred to their city as \"Aram Tzova\" (ארם צובא) after the ancient Aramean city of Aram-Zobah mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.\n\nSpoken languages\nThe Arabic dialect of Aleppo is a type of Syrian Arabic, which is of the North Levantine Arabic variety. Much of its vocabulary is derived from the Syriac language. The Kurdish language is the second most spoken language in the city, after Arabic. Kurds in Aleppo speak the Northern Kurdish (also known as Kurmanji). Syrian Turkmen population of Aleppo speak the Kilis and Antep dialect of the Turkish language. Most Armenians speak the Western form of the Armenian language. The Syriac language is rarely spoken by the Syriac community during daily life, but commonly used as the liturgical language of the Syriac Church. The members of the small Greco-Syrian community in Aleppo speak Arabic. English and French are also spoken.\n\nCulture\nArt\nAleppo is considered one of the main centres of Arabic traditional and classic music with the Aleppine Muwashshahs, Qudud Halabiya and Maqams (religious, secular and folk poetic-musical genres). In December 2021, the Qudud Halabiya was included into the UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list as Intangible cultural heritage.\nAleppines in general are fond of Arab classical music, the Tarab, and it is not a surprise that many artists from Aleppo are considered pioneers among the Arabs in classic and traditional music. The most prominent figures in this field are Sabri Mdallal, Sabah Fakhri, Shadi Jamil, Abed Azrie and Nour Mhanna. Many iconic artists of the Arab music like Sayed Darwish and Mohammed Abdel Wahab were visiting Aleppo to recognize the legacy of Aleppine art and learn from its cultural heritage.\nAleppo is also known for its knowledgeable and cultivated listeners, known as sammi'a or \"connoisseur listeners\". Aleppine musicians often claim that no major Arab artist achieved fame without first earning the approval of the Aleppine sammi'a.\nAleppo hosts many music shows and festivals every year at the citadel amphitheatre, such as the \"Syrian Song Festival\", the \"Silk Road Festival\" and \"Khan al-Harir Festival\".\nAl-Adeyat Archaeological Society founded in 1924 in Aleppo, is a cultural and social organization to preserve the tangible and intangible heritage of Aleppo and Syria in general. The society has branches in other governorates as well.\n\nMuseums\nNational Museum of Aleppo.\nMuseum of the popular traditions known as the Aleppine House at Beit Achiqbash in al-Jdayde.\nAleppo Citadel Museum.\nMuseum of medicine and science at Bimaristan Arghun al-Kamili.\nAleppo Memory Museum at Beit Ghazaleh in al-Jdayde.\nZarehian Treasury of the Armenian Apostolic Church at the old Armenian church of the Holy Mother of God, Al-Jdeydeh.\n\nCuisine\nAleppo is surrounded by olive, nut and fruit orchards, and its cuisine is the product of its fertile land and location along the Silk Road. The International Academy of Gastronomy in France awarded Aleppo its culinary prize in 2007. The city has a wide selection of different types of dishes, such as kebab, kibbeh, dolma, hummus, ful halabi, za'atar halabi, muhshi. Ful halabi is a typical Aleppine breakfast meal: fava bean soup with a splash of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and Aleppo's red peppers. The za'atar of Aleppo (thyme) is a kind of oregano which is popular in the regional cuisines.\n\nThe kibbeh is one of the favourite foods of the locals, and the Aleppines have created more than 17 types of kibbeh dishes, which is considered a form of art for them. These include kibbeh prepared with sumac (kәbbe sәmmāʔiyye), yogurt (kәbbe labaniyye), quince (kәbbe safarjaliyye), lemon juice (kәbbe ḥāmḍa), pomegranate sauce and cherry sauce. Other varieties include the \"disk\" kibbeh (kәbbe ʔrāṣ), the \"plate\" kibbeh (kәbbe bәṣfīḥa or kәbbe bṣēniyye) and the raw kibbeh (kәbbe nayye). Kebab Halabi – influenced by Armenian and Turkish tastes – has around 26 variants including: kebab prepared with cherry (kebab karaz), eggplant (kebab banjan), chili pepper with parsley and pine nut (kebab khashkhash), truffle (kebab kamayeh), tomato paste (kebab hindi), cheese and mushroom (kebab ma'juʔa), etc. The favourite drink is Arak, which is usually consumed along with meze, Aleppine kebabs and kibbehs. Al-Shark beer – a product of Aleppo – is also among the favourite drinks. Local wines and brandies are consumed as well.\nAleppo is the origin of different types of sweets and pastries. The Aleppine sweets, such as mabrumeh, siwar es-sett, balloriyyeh, etc., are characterized by containing high rates of ghee butter and sugar. Other sweets include mamuniyeh, shuaibiyyat, mushabbak, zilebiyeh, ghazel al-banat etc. Most pastries contain Aleppine pistachios and other types of nuts.\n\nLeisure and entertainment\nUntil the break-out of the Battle of Aleppo in July 2012, the city was known for its vibrant nightlife. Several night-clubs, bars and cabarets operated at the centre of the city as well as at the northern suburbs. The historic quarter of al-Jdayde was known for its pubs and boutique hotels, situated within ancient oriental mansions, providing special treats from the Aleppine flavour and cuisine, along with local music.\nClub d'Alep, opened in 1945, is a unique social club known for bridge games and other nightlife activities, located in a 19th-century mansion in the Aziziyah district of central Aleppo.\nThe Aleppo Public Park, opened in 1949, is one of the largest planted parks in Syria, located near in the Aziziyah district, where Queiq River breaks through the green park.\nThe Blue Lagoon water park – heavily damaged during the battles – was one of the favourite places among the locals, as it was the first water park in Syria. Aleppo's Shahba Mall – one of the largest shopping centres in Syria – was also among the most visited locations for the locals. It has received major damages during the civil war.\n\nHistorical sites\nSouqs and khans\nThe city's strategic trading position attracted settlers of all races and beliefs who wished to take advantage of the commercial roads that met in Aleppo from as far as China and Mesopotamia to the east, Europe to the west, and the Fertile Crescent and Egypt to the south. The largest covered souq-market in the world is in Aleppo, with an approximate length of 13 km (8.1 mi).\nAl-Madina Souq, as it is locally known, is an active trade centre for imported luxury goods, such as raw silk from Iran, spices and dyes from India, and coffee from Damascus. Souq al-Madina is also home to local products such as wool, agricultural products and soap. Most of the souqs date back to the 14th century and are named after various professions and crafts, hence the wool souq, the copper souq, and so on. Aside from trading, the souq accommodated the traders and their goods in khans (caravanserais) and scattered in the souq. Other types of small market-places were called caeserias (ﻗﻴﺴﺎﺭﻳﺎﺕ). Caeserias are smaller than khans in their sizes and functioned as workshops for craftsmen. Most of the khans took their names after their location in the souq and function, and are characterized by their façades, entrances and fortified wooden doors.\n\nGates of Aleppo and other historic buildings\nThe old part of the city is surrounded with 5 km-long (3.1 mi), thick walls, pierced by the nine historical gates (many of them are well-preserved) of the old town. These are, clockwise from the north-east of the citadel:\n\nBab al-Hadid, Bab al-Ahmar, Bab al-Nairab, Bab al-Maqam, Bab Qinnasrin, Bab Antakeya, Bāb Jnēn, Bab al-Faraj and Bab al-Nasr.\nThe most significant historic buildings of the ancient city include:\n\nThe Citadel, a large fortress built atop a huge, partially artificial mound rising 50 m (160 ft) above the city, dates back to the first millennium BC. Recent excavations unearthed a temple and 25 statues dating back to the first millennium BC. Many of the current structures date from the 13th century. The Citadel had been extensively damaged by earthquakes, notably in 1822.\nAl-Shibani building, al-Halawiyah Madrasa, al-Muqaddamiyah Madrasa, al-Zahiriyah Madrasa, al-Sultaniyah Madrasa, al-Firdaws Madrasa, Bimaristan Arghun al-Kamili, Beit Junblatt, Bab al-Faraj Clock Tower, etc.\n\nThe following are among the important historic mansions of al-Jdayde Christian quarter:\n\nBeit Wakil, an Aleppine mansion built in 1603, with unique wooden decorations. One of its decorations was taken to Berlin and exhibited in the Museum of Islamic Art, known as the Aleppo Room.\nBeit Achiqbash, an old Aleppine house built in 1757. The building is home to the Popular Traditions Museum since 1975, showing fine decorations of the Aleppine art.\nBeit Ghazaleh, an old 17th-century mansion characterized with fine decorations, carved by the Armenian sculptor Khachadur Bali in 1691. It was used as an Armenian elementary school during the 20th century.\n\nPlaces of worship\nGreat Mosque of Aleppo (Jāmi' Bani Omayya al-Kabīr), founded c. 715 by Umayyad caliph Walid I and most likely completed by his successor Sulayman. The building contains a tomb associated with Zachary, father of John the Baptist. Construction of the present structure for Nur al-Din commenced in 1158. However, it was damaged during the Mongol invasion of 1260 and was rebuilt. The 45 m-high (148 ft) tower (described as \"the principal monument of medieval Syria\") was erected in 1090–1092 under the first Seljuk sultan, Tutush I. It had four façades with different styles. The tower was completely destroyed during the Syrian civil war in March 2013 (reported on 24 March 2013).\nAl-Nuqtah Mosque (\"Mosque of the drop [of blood]\"), a Shī'ah mosque, which contains a stone said to be marked by a drop of Husayn's blood. The site is believed to have previously been a monastery, which was converted into a mosque in 944.\nAl-Shuaibiyah Mosque, Al-Qaiqan Mosque, Mahmandar Mosque, Altun Bogha Mosque, Al-Sahibiyah Mosque, Bahsita Mosque, Al-Tawashi Mosque, Al-Otrush Mosque, Al-Saffahiyah Mosque, Khusruwiyah Mosque, Al-Adiliyah Mosque, Bahramiyah Mosque, etc.\nChurches of al-Jdayde quarter: the Forty Martyrs Armenian Apostolic Cathedral, the Dormition of Our Lady Greek Orthodox church, Mar Assia al-Hakim Syrian Catholic church, the Maronite Cathedral of Saint Elijah, the Armenian Catholic Cathedral of Our Mother of Reliefs and the Melkite Greek Catholic Cathedral of Virgin Mary.\nCentral Synagogue of Aleppo or al-Bandara synagogue, dating to the 9th century. The synagogue was destroyed during an anti-Jewish pogrom in 1947. In the 1980s, the building was restored, but destroyed again during the civil war.\n\nHammams\nAleppo was home to 177 hammams during the medieval period until the Mongol invasion, when many of the prominent structures of the city were destroyed. Before the civil war, 18 hammams were operating in the old city, including:\n\nHammam al-Nahhasin built during the 12th century near khan al-Nahhaseen.\nHammam al-Sultan built in 1211 by Az-Zahir Ghazi.\nHammam al-Bayadah of the Mamluk era built in 1450.\nHammam Yalbugha built in 1491 by the Emir of Aleppo Saif ad-Din Yalbugha al-Naseri.\nHammam al-Jawhary, hammam Azdemir, hammam Bahram Pasha, hammam Bab al-Ahmar, etc.\nAs a city with an ancient architectural style characterized by covered markets, khans, baths, and schools, in addition to mosques and churches, the city is an archaeological treasure in need of continuous care and maintenance. The city was significantly replanned after the end of World War II. In 1954, an architectural plan was adopted by the French architect André Guitton, who proposed the construction of several wide avenues through the city to accommodate the entry of cars. Between 1954 and 1983, many old neighborhoods were demolished under this pretext for expansion, particularly in the northern areas such as Bab al-Faraj and Bab Janin. However, growing awareness of the importance of these buildings ultimately led to the cancellation of Guitton's plan in 1979 and its replacement by a plan by the Swiss urban engineer Stefano Bianco, who launched the idea of preserving the ancient urban fabric of Old Aleppo. This paved the way for UNESCO to include the Old City of Aleppo on the World Heritage List in 1986.\n\nNearby attractions and the Dead Cities\nAleppo's western suburbs are home to a group of historical sites and villages which are commonly known as the Dead Cities. Around 700 abandoned settlements in the northwestern parts of Syria before the 5th century, contain remains of Christian Byzantine architecture. Many hundreds of those settlements are in Mount Simeon (Jabal Semaan) and Jabal Halaqa regions at the western suburbs of Aleppo, within the range of Limestone Massif. Dead Cities were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011, under the name of \"Ancient Villages of Northern Syria\".\n\nThe most notable Dead cities and archaeological sites in Mount Simeon and Mount Kurd near Aleppo include: Kalota Castle and churches northwest of Aleppo, Kharab Shams Byzantine basilica of the 4th century, the half-ruined Roman basilica in Fafertin village dating back to 372 AD, the old Byzantine settlement of Surqanya village at the northwest of Aleppo, the 4th-century Basilica of Sinhar settlement, the Mushabbak Basilica dating back to the second half of the 5th century, the 9th-century BC Assyrian settlement of Kafr Nabu, Brad village and the Saint Julianus Maronite monastery (399–402 AD) where the shrine of Saint Maron is located, the 5th-century Kimar settlement of the Roman and Byzantine eras, the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites of the 5th century, the Syro-Hittite Ain Dara temple of the Iron Age dating back to the 10th and 8th centuries BC, the ancient city of Cyrrhus with the old Roman amphitheatre and two historic bridges, etc.\n\nTransportation\nHighways and roads\nThe main highway leading to and within the city is the M4 Highway, which runs in the eastern side of the city from south to north along the Queiq River. Driving south on M4 Highway gives access to M5 Highway leading to Homs, Hama, and Damascus. The northern bypass of the city called Castello Road leads through Azaz to the border with Turkey and further to the city of Gaziantep. Driving east on M4 Highway gives access to the coastal road leading to Latakia and Tartus. Within the city, main routes include Al Jalaa Street, Shukri Al-Quwatly Street, King Faisal Street, Bab Antakya Street, Ibrahim Hanano Street and Tishreen Boulevard.\n\nPublic transport\nThe city of Aleppo is a major transportation hub, served by a comprehensive public transport network of buses and minibuses. New modern buses are used to connect the city with Damascus and the other Syrian cities to the east and the south of Aleppo. The city is also served by local and inter-city share taxis.\n\nRailway\nAleppo was one of the major stations of Syria that was connected to the Baghdad Railway in 1912, within the Ottoman Empire. The connections to Turkey and onwards to Ankara still exist today, with a twice weekly train from Damascus. It is perhaps for this historical reason that Aleppo is the headquarters of Syria national railway network, Chemins de Fer Syriens. As the railway is relatively slow, much of the passenger traffic to the port of Latakia had moved to road-based air-conditioned coaches. But this has reversed in recent years with the 2005 introduction of South Korean built DMUs providing a regular bi-hourly express service to both Latakia and Damascus, which miss intermediate stations.\nHowever, after the break-out of the civil war in 2011, the Syrian railway network has suffered major damage and is partially out of use. Reconstruction of the Damascus-Aleppo railway line was started in 2020, after its completion and securing rail transport will be resumed.\nThe opening scene in Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express takes place on the railway station in Aleppo: \"It was five o'clock on a winter's morning in Syria. Alongside the platform at Aleppo stood the train grandly designated in railway guides as the Taurus Express.\"\n\nAirport\nAleppo International Airport (IATA: ALP, ICAO: OSAP) is the international airport serving the city. The airport serves as a secondary hub for Syrian Air. The history of the airport dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. It was upgraded and developed in the years to 1999 when the new current terminal was opened.\nThe airport was closed since the beginning of 2013 as a result of the military operations in the area. However, following the Syrian government's recapture of eastern Aleppo during the Battle of Aleppo, an airplane conducted its first flight from the airport in four years.\n\nEconomy\nTrade and industry\nThe main role of the city was as a trading place throughout the history, as it sat at the crossroads of two trade routes and mediated the trade from India, the Tigris and Euphrates regions and the route coming from Damascus in the South, which traced the base of the mountains rather than the rugged seacoast. Although trade was often directed away from the city for political reasons , it continued to thrive until the Europeans began to use the Cape route to India and later to use the route through Egypt to the Red Sea.\nThe commercial traditions in Aleppo have deep roots in the history. The Aleppo Chamber of commerce founded in 1885, is one of the oldest chambers in the Middle East and the Arab world. According to many historians, Aleppo was the most developed commercial and industrial city in the Ottoman Empire after Constantinople and Cairo. However the post-Ottoman conditions favored other cities, such as Haifa, whose economy thrived more in the new circumstances. The issue was that the city's hinterland wasn't included in the \"customs-free zone\" between the newly established British and French mandates which hurt the city's economic growth.\n\nAs the largest urban area in pre-civil war Syria, Aleppo was considered the capital of Syrian industry. The economy of the city was mainly driven by textiles, chemicals, pharmaceutics, agro-processing industries, electrical commodities, alcoholic beverages, engineering and tourism. It occupied a dominant position in the country's manufacturing output, with a share of more than 50% of manufacturing employment, and an even greater export share.\n\nPossessing the most developed commercial and industrial plants in Syria, Aleppo is a major centre for manufacturing precious metals and stones. The annual amount of the processed gold produced in Aleppo is around 8.5 tonnes, making up to 40% of the entire manufactured gold in Syria.\nThe industrial city of Aleppo in Sheikh Najjar district is one of the largest in Syria and the region. Occupying an area of 4,412 ha (10,900 acres) in the north-eastern suburbs of Aleppo, the total investments in the city counted more than US$3.4 billion during 2010. Still under development, it is envisaged to open hotels, exhibition centres and other facilities within the industrial city.\nIn July 2022, the Aleppo Thermal Power Plant, which generates 200 megawatts of electricity for the city and its surroundings, was put into partial operation after restoration.\nThe old traditional crafts are well-preserved in the old part of the city. The famous laurel soap of Aleppo is considered to be the world's first hard soap.\n\nConstruction\nIn the 2000s, Aleppo was one of the fastest-growing cities in Syria and the Middle East. Many villagers and inhabitants of other Syrian districts are migrating to Aleppo in an effort to find better job opportunities, a fact that always increases population pressure, with a growing demand for new residential capacity. New districts and residential communities have been built in the suburbs of Aleppo, many of them were still under construction as of 2010.\nTwo major construction projects are scheduled in Aleppo: the \"Old City Revival\" project and the \"Reopening of the stream bed of Queiq River\":\n\nThe Old City revival project completed its first phase by the end of 2008, and the second phase started in early 2010. The purpose of the project is the preservation of the old city of Aleppo with its souqs and khans, and restoration of the narrow alleys of the old city and the roads around the citadel.\nThe restoration of Queiq River is directed towards the revival of the flow of the river, demolishing both the artificial cover of the stream bed and the reinforcement of the stream banks along the river in the city centre. The flow of the river was blocked during the 1960s by the Turks, turning the river into a tiny sewage channel, something that led the authorities to cover the stream during the 1970s. In 2008 the flow of pure water was restored through the efforts of the Syrian government, granting a new life to the Quweiq River.\nLike other major Syrian cities, Aleppo is suffering from the dispersal of informal settlements: almost half of its population (around 1.2 million) is estimated to live in 22 informal settlements of different types.\n\nEducation\nAs the main economic centre of Syria, Aleppo has a large number of educational institutions. According to the UNICEF, there are around over 1280 schools in Aleppo and its suburbs that welcomed 485,000 new students as of September 2018, and around 25,000 students resumed their learning as of December 2021.\nNot to mention there are some colleges. In addition to the University of Aleppo, there are state colleges and private universities which attract large numbers of students from other regions of Syria and the Arab countries. The number of the students in Aleppo University is more than 60,000. The university has 18 faculties and 8 technical colleges in the city of Aleppo.\nCurrently, there are two private universities operating in the city: al-Shahba University (SU) and Mamoun University for Science and Technology (MUST). Branches of the state conservatory and the fine arts school are also operating in the city.\nAleppo is home to several Christian schools, such as St. Mariam's Christian School (the city's main Christian school) and Armenian private schools as well as two international schools: International School of Aleppo and Lycée Français d'Alep.\n\nSport\nThe city of Aleppo is considered as important centre of team sports with football being the most popular in the city. The five major sporting clubs of the city are al-Ittihad SC, al-Hurriya SC, al-Yarmouk SC, Jalaa SC and Ouroube SC. Many other sport clubs are located in several districts of the city including al-Herafyeen SC, Shorta Aleppo SC, Ommal Aleppo SC, Nayrab SC, al-Shahbaa SC, al-Qala'a SC and Aleppo Railways SC.\n\nBasketball is also played in the city. All of the 5 Aleppine major sport clubs participate in the men's and women's top division of the Syrian Basketball League, in which both Jalaa SC and Al-Ittihad SC consecutively dominated winning the league from 1956 to 1993.\nIn July 2022, international qualifying matches were played in Aleppo for the first time since the beginning of the conflict. In the Hamadaniah Arena, the Syrian national team met the teams of Iran and Bahrain as part of the qualification for the World Cup.\nOther sports being practiced by the major clubs in the city include tennis, handball, volleyball, athletics, table tennis and swimming.\nWith a capacity of 53,200 seats, the Aleppo International Stadium is the largest sports venue in Syria. Other major sport venues in the city include the Al-Hamadaniah Sports Arena, Bassel al-Assad Swimming Complex, and Al-Hamadaniah Olympic Swimming and Diving Complex.\nOn 29 January 2017, Aleppo hosted the first sports event since 2012, when the local football rivals al-Ittihad SC and al-Hurriya SC played at the Ri'ayet al-Shabab Stadium, within the frames of the 2016–17 Syrian Premier League.\n\nMunicipality\nThe city of Aleppo is the capital of Aleppo Governorate and the centre of Mount Simeon District. Aleppo City Council is the governing body of the city. The first municipality council was formed in 1868. However, the governor being appointed directly by the president of the republic, has a supreme authority over the city and the entire governorate. But the city is managed directly by the mayor.\n\nSubdivisions\nDistricts in Aleppo can be considered in four categories:\n\nOld quarters inside the walls of the ancient city.\nOld quarters outside the walls of the ancient city.\nModern neighborhoods, including a newly developed area called The New Aleppo.\nInformal settlements.\n\nIntegrated Urban Development in Aleppo\nThe \"Integrated Urban Development in Aleppo\" (UDP) is a joint programme between the German Development Cooperation (GTZ) and the Municipality of Aleppo. The programme promotes capacities for sustainable urban management and development at the national and municipal level.\nThe Programme has three fields of work:\n\nAleppo City Development Strategy (CDS): promoting support structures for the municipality, including capacity building, networking, and developing municipal strength in the national development dialogue.\nInformal Settlements (IS): includes strategy and management development of informal settlements.\nThe Project for the Rehabilitation of the Old City of Aleppo (OCA): includes further support for the rehabilitation of the Old City, as well as for a city development strategy oriented to the long term.\nThe UDP cooperates closely with other interventions in the sector, namely the EU-supported 'Municipal Administration Modernization' programme. It is planned to operate from 2007 to 2016.\n\nPreservation of the ancient city\nAs an ancient trading centre, Aleppo has impressive souqs, khans, hammams, madrasas, mosques and churches, all in need of more care and preservation work. After World War II the city was significantly redesigned; in 1954 French architect André Gutton had a number of wide new roads cut through the city to allow easier passage for modern traffic. Between 1954 and 1983 many buildings in the old city were demolished to allow for the construction of modern apartment blocks, particularly in the northwestern areas (Bab al-Faraj and Bab al-Jinan). As awareness for the need to preserve this unique cultural heritage increased, Gutton's master plan was finally abandoned in 1979 to be replaced with a new plan presented by the Swiss expert and urban designer Stefano Bianca, which adopted the idea of \"preserving the traditional architectural style of Ancient Aleppo\" paving the way for UNESCO to declare the Old City of Aleppo as a World Heritage Site in 1986.\n\nSeveral international institutions have joined efforts with local authorities and the Aleppo Archaeological Society, to rehabilitate the old city by accommodating contemporary life while preserving the old one. The governorate and the municipality are implementing serious programmes directed towards the enhancement of the ancient city and Jdeydeh quarter.\nThe German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and Aga Khan Foundation (within the frames of Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme) has made a great contribution in the preservation process of the old city.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nAleppo is twinned with:\n\n Brest, Belarus (2010)\n Gaziantep, Turkey (2005, 2025)\n Izmir, Turkey (1995)\n Lyon, France (2000)\n Osmangazi, Turkey (2010)\n\nNotable people\nSee also\nPinus halepensis\nTulipa aleppensis\nAleppo Room\nJaysh Muhammad in Bilad al-Sham\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nBasan, Osman Aziz (2010).

          "summary": "Aleppo is the largest city in Syria and serves as the capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the most populous governorate of Syria. With an estimated population of 2,098,000 residents as of 2021, it is Syria's largest city by urban area, and was the primary economic centre until it was surpassed by Damascus, the capital of Syria. Aleppo is also the largest city in Syria's northern governorates and one of the largest cities in the Levant region.\nAleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world; it may have been inhabited since the sixth millennium BC. Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari, just south of the old city of Aleppo, show that the area was occupied by Amorites by the latter part of the third millennium BC. That is also the time at which Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets unearthed in Ebla and Mesopotamia, which speak of it as part of the Amorite state of Yamhad, and note its commercial and military importance. Such a long history is attributed to its strategic location as a trading center between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia. For centuries, Aleppo was the largest city in the Syrian region, and the Ottoman Empire's third-largest after Constantinople (now Istanbul) and Cairo. The city's significance in history has been its location at one end of the Silk Road, which passed through Central Asia and Mesopotamia. When the Suez Canal was inaugurated in 1869, much trade was diverted to sea and Aleppo began its slow decline.\nAt the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, Aleppo lost its northern hinterland to modern Turkey, as well as the important Baghdad Railway connecting it to Mosul. In 1939, it lost its main access to the sea, by Antakya and İskenderun, also to Turkey. The growth in importance of Damascus in the past few decades further exacerbated the situation. This decline may have helped to preserve the old city of Aleppo, its medieval architecture and traditional heritage. It won the title of the Islamic Capital of Culture 2006 and has had a wave of successful restorations of its historic landmarks. The battle of Aleppo occurred in the city during the Syrian civil war, and many parts of the city suffered massive destruction. Affected parts of the city are currently undergoing reconstruction. An estimated 31,000 people were killed in Aleppo during the conflict.",

احتلت في الجزء الاخير من الالفيه الثالثه على الاقل  ويظهر هذا في اول ذكر لحلب في الالواح المسماريه المكتشفه في مملكه ايبلا و‌بلاد الرافدين حيث لوحظ تفوقها العسكري والتجاري. مثل هذا التاريخ ربما يرجع الى كونها نقطه تجاريه استراتيجيه في منتصف الطريق بين البحر الابيض المتوسط و‌بلاد الرافدين وفي كونها في نهايه طريق الحرير الذي يمر عبر اسيا الوسطى و‌بلاد الرافدين. وبقيت حلب لقرون اكبر المدن السوريه وثالث مدينه في الدوله العثمانيه بعد اسطنبول و‌القاهره. تحولت التجاره الى البحر عندما تم افتتاح قناه السويس عام 1869 وبدات اهميه حلب بالتراجع بشكل بطيء. تلقت حلب اكبر الضربات عند بدايه القرن العشرين، فعند سقوط الخلافه العثمانيه بعد الحرب العالميه الاولى سلخت عن حلب اجزاؤها الشماليه (معظمها ضمن الاقاليم السوريه الشماليه) التي ضمت الى تركيا عام 1920 بالاتفاق بين اتاتورك و‌سلطات الانتداب الفرنسي. خسرت حلب التجاره مع مدن هذه الاقاليم خاصه المدن التي كانت تابعه لولايه حلب تاريخيا كعنتاب و‌مرعش و‌اضنه و‌مرسين، كما خسرت السكك الحديديه المهمّه التي كانت تصلها بالموصل. ادت اتفاقيه سايكس بيكو وفصل العراق عن سوريه الى كساد وتدهور كبير في اقتصاد حلب. وفي عام 1940 فقدت حلب امكانيه وصولها الى البحر بعد خسارتها لمنفذها الرئيسي على البحر الابيض المتوسط في الاسكندرونه. تراجع موقع حلب السياسي بسبب جعل مدينه دمشق عاصمه لسوريا. رغم كل هذه الضربات، بقيت هذه المدينه عاصمه اقتصاديه لسوريا، فهي تضم اهم المعامل الصناعيه وهي ايضا تشكل مركزا للمناطق الزراعيه في سوريا، وخاصه زراعه القطن الضروريه لمعامل النسيج المزدهره في المدينه. كانت حلب وريفها تعطي معظم الناتج الاجمالي السوري حتى نهايه الخمسينات  اصبحت المدينه القديمه في مدينه حلب من مواقع التراث العالمي اليونسكو في عام 1986. وقد نالت المدينه لقب عاصمه الثقافه الاسلاميه عن الوطن العربي في عام 2006 م. وخلال احداث الازمه السوريه، تضررت حلب بشكل كبير انسانيا واقتصاديا بفعل القتال والقصف ونقل المعامل الى تركيا، وتوقفت عجله الاقتصاد في المدينه وتعرض الكثير من معالمها الاثريه للدمار مثل مئذنه المسجد الاموي واحتراق معظم اسواق حلب القديمه.\n\nالتسميه\nكما هو حال معظم المدن القديمه، هنالك عده نظريات حول اسم المدينه حيث ذكرت في الكثير من المخطوطات والوثائق التاريخيه القديمه؛ وقد ورد ذكر حلب في رُقم مملكه ابلا باسم ارمان في عهد ريموش بن سرجون الاكدي في الالف الثالث قبل الميلاد.\nبينما يرى البعض انها وردت باسم اران على مسله نارام سين في ديار بكر والتي تعود للالف الثالث قبل الميلاد وسميت باسم هليا في مخلفات مملكه ماري (تل الحريري) ودعيت حلبو عندما كانت عاصمه لمملكه يمحاض الاموريه في حوالي 1800 قبل الميلاد بينما اطلقت عليها الكتابات الاشوريه خلابا وخلوان.\nوذكرت حلب منذ القرن السادس عشر قبل الميلاد باسم خرب في الاثار المصريه. وقد ورد اسم خلبو في احدى النصوص التي تعود الى زمن رمسيس الثاني، بينما اظهر نص اخر يعود الى ذات العهد لفظ حلبو حيث خسر ملكها امام رمسيس الثاني نتيجه لتدخله لصالح ملوك الحيثيون على المصريين في معركه قادش.بينما عرفت المدينه باسم بيروا Beroe ابان قيام دوله السلوقيين عقب انقسام امبراطوريه الاسكندر المقدوني. بينما يعتقد اخرون ان سلوقس الاول نيكاتور مؤسس الحكم السلوقي اطلق على المدينه عام 312 قبل الميلاد اسم Bereoa بيروا وتلفظ بالفرنسيه بيريه BERE، على اسم مسقط راس فيليب الثاني المقدوني والد الاسكندر المقدوني، وبقيت حلب تحمل هذا الاسم طيله العصور اليونانيه والرومانيه والبيزنطيه.اختلفت وجهات النظر حول اسم حلب ذاته حيث ان البعض عزا الاسم الى تعريب كلمه حلبا السريانيه التي تعني البيضاء فقيل حلب. وقال البعض الاخر بان لفظه حلب اراميه وان الاشوريين والمصريين الاقدمين سموها حلبو. بينما ذكر احد مؤرخي المدينه وهو خير الدين الاسدي ان اصل كلمه حلب يعود الى حَلْ رب فيقال حَلْ لَب حيث ان معنى كلمه حَلْ هو المحل وكلمه لَبْ هو التجمع فيصبح معنى كلمه حلب هو موضع التجمع. وقد ذكرت المدينه ايضاً باسم ارام صوبا حيث ورد هذا الاسم في سِفر الملوك الثاني من كتاب العهد القديم. اما لفظه الشهباء ففسرها البعض بانها من الشهب وهو البياض يتخلله السواد، حيث لقبت بهذا اللقب لبياض تربتها وحجارتها. ويرجح اخرون بان اصل كلمه الشهباء يعود الى بقره شهباء قيل ان النبي ابراهيم كان يحلبها فقيل حلب الشهباء، وقد قوبل هذا الطرح بالعديد من الانتقادات من المؤرخين الذين اعتبروه محض اسطوره تنافي العلم والمنطق. بالنسبه للاسم في اللغات الاجنبيه، يتم استخدام كلٍ من Alep وAleppo دون تمييز رغم ان Aleppo هي عباره عن نسخهٍ ايطاليه من الاسم في الاساس.\n\nالتاريخ\nعصور ما قبل التاريخ\nنادراً ما تم التطرق الى حلب من قبل علماء الاثار، حيث ان المدينه الحديثه تحتل ذات الموقع الذي كانت تحتله المدينه القديمه، وقد اظهرت الحفريات في تل السودا ان المدينه احتلت هذا الموقع منذ حوالي الـ 5000 سنه.\n\nعصر البرونز\nوصفت حلب في السجلات التاريخيه كمدينه هامه في وقت متاخر مقارنه بدمشق، والتي سبقتها ببضعه الاف من السنين فقط .. وتكتسب مدينه  حلب العريقه اهميتها التاريخيه بكونها ثاني اقدم المدن السوريه بعد مدينه دمشق حيث ان حلب ذكرت للمره الاولى في الالف الثالث قبل الميلاد، عندما كانت عاصمه مملكه مستقله مرتبطه بابلا هي مملكه ارمان او ارمي كما سميت في ابلا وارماني كما سميت من قبل الاكديين. حيث يصف عالم الاثار جوفاني بيتيناتو مملكه ارمان بانها كانت تشبه مملكه ابلا في النرجسيه. قام نارام سين الاكادي بتدمير كلتا المملكتين ابلا وارمان في القرن الثالث وعشرين قبل الميلاد.\n\nالعصر البرونزي المتوسط\nفي فتره الدوله البابليه القديمه، ظهرت تسميه حلبا لاول مره. وكانت وقتها عاصمهً لسلاله العموريين لمملكه يمحاض (حوالي 1800-1600 قبل الميلاد) والمعروفه ايضاً باسم ارض حلب كانت الاقوى في الشرق الادنى انذاك. دمرت على ايدي الحثيين تحت قياده مرسيليس الاول في القرن الـ 16 قبل الميلاد. ومع ذلك، ما لبثت حلب ان استعادت دورها الريادي في سوريا بعدما خفّت القوه الحيثيون في المنطقه نتيجه للصراعات الداخليه.\n\nالعصر البرونزي المتاخر\nقام الملك الميتاني بارشطار ملك احدى الممالك الحوريه باستغلال فراغ السلطه الناجم عن ضعف الحثيين وغزا حلب في القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، لتجد حلب نفسها على خط المواجهه ما بين مملكه الميتانيين والحيثيين ومصر. واستعاد الملك الحثي سابيليوليوما الاول حلب من بين ايدي الميتانيين في القرن الرابع عشر قبل الميلاد، فقد كان لحلب اهميه مقدسه لدى الحيثيون وغدت مركز عباده اله العاصفه المقدس.\n\nالعصر الحديدي\nعندما انهارت مملكه الحيثيون في القرن الثاني عشر قبل الميلاد، اصبحت حلب جزءاً من مملكه ارفاد الاراميه السور-حيثيه (والمعروفه ايضاً باسم بيت اغوشي والتي تعرف في هذه الايام بتل رفعت) في بدايه الالفيه الاولى قبل الميلاد. كما واصبحت عاصمه في نهايات القرن 9 قبل الميلاد. اصبحت حلب قسماً من الامبراطوريه الاشوريه الثانيه، قبل ان تسقط في يد المملكه البابليه الثانيه، والامبراطوريه الاخمينييه الفارسيه.\n\nالعهد الهيليني والروماني والفارسي\nاستولى الاسكندر المقدوني على المدينه عام 333 ق.م، واقام سلوقس الاول مستعمرهً هيلينيه في المدينه بين 301-286 قبل الميلاد، وسماها بيرويا على اسم مدينه بيرويا في مقدونيا.\nاستمرت بيرويا تحت حكم السلوقيين مده 300 عام حتى سلمها اخر سلالتهم للقائد بومبيوس الكبير عام 64 قبل الميلاد، واصبحت بذلك جزءاً من مقاطعه سوريا الرومانيه. ظلت المدينه تحت الحكم الروماني ثلاثه قرونٍ اخرى، رغم ان روما لم تفرض عليها اسلوب الاداره الرومانيه نظراً لانها مقاطعه اغريقيه قديمه يتكلم سكانها اللغه اليونانيه. كانت حلب وقتها او بيرويا المدينه الثانيه من حيث الاهميه في سوريا بعد انطاكيه في القرن 6. وتحفل المنطقه بالعديد من اللقى الاثريه والاديره والكنائس لعل اشهرها دير مار سمعان العمودي او سان سيمون، و‌ضريح مار مارون حيث يوجد قبر مؤسس الطائفه القديس مارون في منطقه براد غرب حلب. ذكرت بيرويا ايضاً مرتين في العهد القديم في السفر 13:3.\nسقطت حلب ايضاً في يد الامبراطوريه الساسانيه عندما غزت سوريا في بدايات القرن السابع.\n\nعهد الفتح الاسلامي\nفتحت مدينه حلب بقياده ابو عبيده بن الجراح وخالد بن الوليد عام 637 ميلادي، لتشكل جزءاً من دوله الخلافه الراشده ثم الامويه ومن بعدها العباسيه. وفي عام 944 غدت عاصمه الدوله الحمدانيه تحت حكم سيف الدوله الحمداني، عاشت المدينه عصراً ذهبياً ايام الامير سيف الدوله وكانت احد الثغور الهامه للدفاع عن العالم الاسلامي في وجه المد البيزنطي، احتلت المدينه لفتره قصيره بين عامي 974 و987، اثناء الصراع البيزنطي السلجوقي، تمت محاصره حلب ايضاً مرتين اثناء الحروب الصليبيه عامي 1098 و1124 الا ان الجيوش الصليبيه لم تتمكن من احتلالها لمناعه تحصينها.\nفي 9 اب عام 1138، تعرضت المدينه لزلزال مدمرٍ دمرها والمناطق المحيطه، ويصنف على انه الزلزال الخامس من بين الزلازل التاريخيه الاشد دماراً في العصور القديمه.\n\nعهد الغزو المغولي والدفاع الايوبي\nانضوت المدينه تحت حكم صلاح الدين في عهد الدوله الايوبيه منذ عام 1183.في 24 كانون الثاني لعام 1260، تم احتلال المدينه من قبل المغول تحت قياده هولاكو  بالتعاون مع حاكم انطاكيه بوهيموند السادس، دافعت عن المدينه حاميه متواضعه من قبل الملك الايوبي غياث الدين طوران شاه وسقطت المدينه بعد 6 ايامٍ من القصف المستمر بالمنجنيقات، وسقطت القلعه بعدها باربعه اسابيع، تم ذبح السكان بوحشيه. الا ان الملك طوران شاه لم يذبح وابدي له احترام لبسالته على غير عاده المغول. وتابع بعدها الجيش المغولي تقدمه نحو دمشق ليحاصرها ويقتحمها هي الاخرى في 1 اذار عام 1260.\nاستعاد المملوكيون زمام المبادره بعد انتصارهم في موقعه عين جالوت في 3 ايلول / سبتمبر عام 1260 بقياده الملك المظفر سيف الدين قطز وتم قتل القائد النسطوري كتبغا الموالي لهولاكو واستعاده دمشق بعدها بخمسه ايام وحلب بعدها بشهر.\nاستقلت حلب عن الدوله المملوكيه المركزيه في القاهره عندما قام الملك الظاهر بيبرس المملوكي باعلان الانفصال، وارسل قواته في خريف عام 1261 لاستعاده المدينه. في تشرين الاول لعام 1271 هاجم المغول مرهً اخرى حلب بجيشٍ يضم عشره الاف فارس قادمين من الاناضول بعد هزيمتهم للتركمان الذين حاولوا المساعده في حمايه المدينه، ونجحوا في احتلالها وتقدموا نحو حماه، لكن الظاهر بيبرس اعد جيشاً قويا تمكن من اجبار المغول على الجلاء عن حلب مره اخرى.\nاستولى المغول مجدداً على المدينه في 20 تشرين الاول 1280، وعاثوا فيها فساداً وتدميراً في الجوامع والاسواق، وهرب السكان نحو دمشق، ليقوم القائد المملوكي المنصور سيف الدين قلاوون بتجهيز قواته للرد، وما ان راى المغول الجحافل تتقدم حتى تراجعوا هرباً الى ما بعد نهر الفرات.\nعادت حلب للحكم الذاتي اذاً عام 1317. وفي عام 1400 قام القائد المغولي تيمورلنك باسر المدينه  وذبح الكثير من السكان ويقال بانه امر ببناء تله من جماجم السكان استخدم فيها عشرين الف جمجمه ، وبعد تراجع المغوليين، عاد السكان المسلمون خاصهً ليحتموا في المدينه، اما المسيحيون فقد قام بعضهم ممن لم يستطيعوا الدخول مره اخرى بانشاء حي جديد عام 1420 خارج حدود السور الشمالي تم تسميته بالحي الجديد او الجديده. ولعبوا دور همزه الوصل في التجاره بين تجار حلب والمحيط الخارجي لتمتعهم بحمايه نسبيه من قبل الممالك الصليبيه في القدس وانطاكيه.\n\nالفتره العثمانيه\nاضحت حلب جزءاً من الدوله العثمانيه عام 1516، وكان تعداد السكان في نفس الفتره حوالي 50000 نسمه، وكانت مركز ولايه حلب وعاصمه سوريا.\nنظراً لموقعها الاستراتيجي القريب من الاناضول، لعبت حلب دوراً محورياً في الدوله العثمانيه، وكانت المدينه الثانيه بعد القسطنطينيه، والمدينه الرئيسيه للتجاره بين بلاد الشرق والغرب. واذا كانت السفارات الغربيه واقعه في اسطنبول، فانّ المهام القنصليه الرئيسيه كانت تتم في حلب، وابتداءً من القرن الثامن عشر بشكل خاص بدا القناصل والتجار الاوروبيون يتمنون السكن في حلب مع عائلاتهم مؤسسين بذلك سلالات راسخه. لكن الاقتصاد في المدينه تاثر بشده بعد افتتاح قناه السويس عام 1869، حيث انتعشت دمشق اقتصادياً وعادت لها اهميتها الحيويه كمركز العاصمه السوريه مره اخرى بعد افول نجمها كما في ايام الامويين والايوبيين.\n\nمن الشواهد على ذيوع صيت حلب في تلك الفتره ذكرها مرتين في قصص السير وليم شكسبير عام 1606 في قصه ماكبث. اسشتهاد اخر نراه في قصه عطيل.\n\nاستمرت المدينه تحت الحكم العثماني حتى انهيار الامبراطوريه. مع نهايه الحرب العالميه الاولى، حددت معاهده سيفر مقاطعه حلب كجزء من سوريا، بينما تم وعد الارمن بتحقيق استقلال هضبه ارمينيا من قبل فرنسا في المعاهده الفرنسيه الارمنيه المبرمه عام 1916، لكن مصطفى كمال اتاتورك رفض هذه المعاهده واستمر بضم حلب والاناضول وارمينيا الى تركيا وخاض حروباً لاستقلال التراب التركي، وقد دعم السكان العرب والاكراد في المدينه النضال التركي بدايهً ضد الفرنسيين باعتقادهم انه سيجلب لهم الاستقلال، ومن اشهرهم ابراهيم هنانو الذي قام بالتنسيق في فتره من الفترات مع كمال اتاتورك، لكن النهايه جاءت كارثيه على حلب؛ فمع عقد معاهده لوزان تم انتزاع معظم مقاطعه حلب باستثناء حلب نفسها ولواء الاسكندرونه، وهكذا تم سلخ حلب عن الاناضول ومدنه التي كانت تضمها علاقات تجاريه مكثفه. الاسوا من ذلك كان معاهده سايكس - بيكو التي قسمت بلاد الشام وفصلتها عن العراق. وزادت عزله حلب اكثر بعد ان تم ايضاً سلخ لواء الاسكندرونه عام 1939، فتم حرمان حلب من مينائها الرئيسي ليجعلها معزوله تماماً.\n\nمرحله الانتداب الفرنسي\nقامت ولايه حلب بعد اعلان الجنرال الفرنسي هنري غورو في ايلول عام 1920 الانتداب الفرنسي على سوريا والذي قسم البلد لدويلات لتسهيل التحكم بها بغرض تاديب السوريين على تصديهم لفرنسا في معركه ميسلون. كان هدف غورو تعزيز التنافس التجاري بين كل من حلب ودمشق املا ان ينقلب الى انقسامٍ سياسي على مبدا فرق تسد الاستعماري، فقام بدعم الامتيازات الاقتصاديه في حلب ليزعج الدمشقيين واعلن دمشق عاصمه ليستفز الحلبيين، كان هدف غورو اغراء حلب بالامتيازات الاقتصاديه لجعلها ترفض اي فكرهٍ للوحده مع دمشق التي تم افقارها نسبياً.\nلكن محدوديه الموارد في سوريا وترابط علاقات مدنها الاقتصاديه وقتها جعلت الحكومه الفرنسيه غير قادره على استخدام فكره الولايات المنفصله لانها هددت بحصول رد فعل عكسي في الولايات الفقيره لتنادي بالوحده مرهً اخرى، وقامت فرنسا حينها باقتراح قيام فيدراليه ولايات سوريا عام 1923 (بما فيها ولايه لبنان)، ليتم في النهايه ضم ولاياتٍ ثلاث، ولايه حلب ودمشق واللاذقيه، تم تحديد حلب كعاصمهٍ في البدايه، ثم ما لبثت ان اعيدت دمشق عاصمه؛ وكان رئيس الفيدراليه هو السيد صبحي بركات من مواليد مدينه حلب.\nتم ايقاف العمل بالفيدراليه عام 1924 عندما قامت فرنسا، ولنفس اسباب التفرقه، بفصل حلب ودمشق في ولايه وجعل ولايه اللاذقيه ولايه منفصلهً للعلويين بعد ان استشعر الفرنسيون خطر نزعه استقلاليه بعد فترهٍ من اتحاد الولايات الثلاث.\nوبعد هذا بقليل في عام 1925 قامت في السويداء جبل الدروز الثوره السوريه الكبرى بقياده سلطان باشا الاطرش؛ ارادت فرنسا الرد على السوريين فاوعزت الى البرلمان الحلبي (وكان جلّ اعضائه من الموالين لها) بالانعقاد واعلان الانفصال عن دمشق. ولكن الوطنيين في حلب بقياده ابراهيم هنانو ثاروا بقوه واحبطوا المشروع الفرنسي بعد ان اقاموا الاحتجاجات والتظاهرات وقاموا بقطع الطرق المؤديه الى البرلمان يوم التصويت لمنع اعضائه من الوصول والتصويت على قرارهم المتوقع. وفي عام 1930 كانت حلب جزءاً من الجمهوريه السوريه، في عام 1936 تم توقيع معاهده الاستقلال مع فرنسا وقيام حكومه الملك فيصل، ونالت حلب استقلالها كجزء من سوريا مجدداً في عام 1946 بعد ان قامت حكومه فيشي الفرنسيه بنقض المعاهده السابقه واعاده احتلال سوريا عام 1941.\n\nما بعد الاستقلال\nشاركت حلب بقوه في الحياه السياسيه ما بعد الاستقلال، فكان اول رئيس حكومه وطنيه من حلب وهو سعد الله الجابري، وبعد فتره تبعه ناظم القدسي و‌معروف الدواليبي، وكان محمد ناجي عطري اخر رئيس حكومه من مدينه حلب. والحلبي الوحيد الذي وصل الى منصب رئيس الجمهوريه هو امين الحافظ بدعم من حزب البعث في 27 تموز / يوليو 1963. كما نشات في حلب عده حركات مثلاً حزب الشعب عام 1948 بقياده رشدي الكيخيا و‌ناظم القدسي والذي اتخذ من مدينه حلب مقراً رئيساً له. كما تاسست فيها حركه الاخوان المسلمين في سوريا في عام 1937،\nعانت المدينه من نزاع مسلح بين حركه الاخوان المسلمين والحكومه السوريه بين عامي 1979 و‌1982، ويعتقد بانها ثاني مدينه سقط فيها قتلى ضمن هذا النزاع بعد حماه.\n\nالثوره السوريه 2011-2024\nشهدت المدينه عدداً من الاحداث بعدَ اندلاع حركه الاحتجاجات السوريه 2011، فقد خرجت اول مظاهره مناهضه لنظام الاسد وحزب البعث فيها في «جمعه العزه» بتاريخ 25 مارس 2011، ثمَّ اصبحت المظاهرات فيها حدثاً شبه اسبوعيّ او حتى يومي، واخذت بالتوسع شيئاً فشيئاً، ولو انها لم تصل الى قوه حركه الاحتجاجات في باقي مناطق سوريا. في تاريخ 30 يونيو 2011 اطلقت تنسيقيات الاحتجاجات عُنوان «بركان حلب» على يوم الخميس ذاك في مُحاوله لتاجيج المُظاهرات في المدينه اكثر، وادى ذلك الى خروج المظاهرات في اكثر من عشره مناطق في المدينه وحُدوث محاولات للاعتصام في ساحه سعد الله الجابري الرئيسيه بها، كما سقط قتيل خلال تلك المسيرات.\n\nفي 12 اغسطس 2011 خرجت مظاهرات ضخمه في المدينه هي الاولى من نوعها تحت شعار «جمعه لن نركع الا لله»، وبسبب هذا اطلق الامن النار على المُحتجين فسقطَ 3 قتلى في حيّ الصاخور، وادى ذلك الى تاجيج المظاهرات به اكثر واكثر. وفي تاريخ 17 اغسطس 2011 تكرَّرت محاولات مُشابهه لتحريك المدينه بعدَ اطلاق شعار «اربعاء بدر حلب» على ذلك اليوم، وادى ذلك الى خروج مظاهرات ضخمه مشابهه للتي خرجت يوم بركان حلب ووصل خلالها الثوار الى ساحه سعد الله الجابري في قلب المدينه،  وفي يوم الثلاثاء 6 سبتمبر خرجت مظاهره كبيره ضد النظام من الجامع الاموي وذلك في تشييع مفتي حلب ابراهيم السلقيني الذي كان قد توفي قبلها بيوم، ويَقول معارضون للنظام ان المخابرات السوريه هي التي قتلته، وذلك اثر موقفه المؤيد للثوره السوريه.\nومنذ بدايه عام 2012 اصبحت المظاهرات السلميه ضد النظام حاشده ويوميه في حلب وتركزت في عده احياء مثل صلاح الدين والسكري وبستان القصر و‌الجامعه وغيرها، وكان يسقط عشرات القتلى من جمعه الى جمعه في هذه المظاهرات، في 20 يوليو 2012 اندلعت اشتباكات مسلحه عنيفه داخل المدينه بين الجيش السوري الحر وقوات النظام في ما عرف لاحقا بمعركه حلب، ومن ثم بدا الجيش السوري قصفه العنيف على احياء في المدينه، وقد ادى هذا القصف لمقتل اكثر من 4000 شخص بعد اشهر من المعارك معظمهم مدنيون  كما ذكرت الامم المتحده ان اكثر من 200 الف شخص فروا من حلب منذ بدء المعارك فيها.\nاخر تقييم لمنظمه الامم المتحده للتربيه والعلم والثقافه (اليونسكو) لحجم الاضرار في المواقع الاثريه في مدينه حلب القديمه بين ان ثلث المدينه تم تدميره بالكامل  خلال سنوات الحرب في سوريا واضافت ان 60% من مدينه حلب القديمه قد تضرر بشكل كبير و30% تم تدميره كليا.\n\nمعركه حلب 2024\nفي يوم 29 نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني، دخلت قوات المعارضه احياء الحمدانيه وحلب الجديده في مدينه حلب بعد تنفيذ هجوم انتحاري مزدوج بسيارتين مفخختين. وفي النصف الثاني من اليوم، سيطرت قوات المعارضه على خمسه احياء من مدينه حلب، وهي الحمدانيه، حلب الجديده، الجميليه، وصلاح الدين. ووردت تقارير عن اشتباكات في مناطق اخرى من المدينه، بما في ذلك وسطها. كما استولت قوات المعارضه على 20 بلده وقريه اخرى، من بينها مدينه سراقب الاستراتيجيه وسط انهيار خطوط دفاع القوات المسلحه السوريه. وشملت القرى والبلدات التي استولت عليها قوات المعارضه: خان السبل، الطليحيه، الترنبه، وجوباس في ريف ادلب، وخان طومان، شغيدله، خَلْصَه، الحاضر، القراصي، بَرْنه، العيس، تلحديه، زيتان، المنصوره، والبوابيه في ريف حلب.\nبحلول نهايه يوم 29 نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني 2024، سيطرت قوات المعارضه على اجزاء من احياء السكري، الفرقان، الاعظميه، وسيف الدوله في مدينه حلب، وسيطرت على الساحه الرئيسيه في وسط المدينه.\nفي الساعات الاولى من يوم 30 نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني 2024، استولت قوات المعارضه على قلعه حلب ومقر المحافظ في المدينه، واعلنت السيطره على \"اكثر من نصف مدينه حلب\". بحلول الصباح، سيطرت قوات المعارضه على معظم مدينه حلب، مما اجبر القوات المسلحه السوريه على الانسحاب نحو السفيره.\n\nالمناخ\nيمكن اعتبار المناخ في حلب مناخاً شبه قاري، نظراً لان سلسله الجبال المحاذيه للبحر الابيض المتوسط الشامله جبال اللاذقيه وجبال الامانوس تقوم بحجب تاثيرات المناخ المتوسطي على المدينه. معدل درجات الحراره يتراوح بين 18-20 درجه مئويه، ومتوسط هطول الامطار حوالي 385 ملم. 80% من الامطار تحصل بين شهري تشرين الاول و‌اذار. من النادر تساقط الثلوج وان كانت المدينه تشهدها كل بضع سنوات. ومتوسط درجه الرطوبه حوالي 58%.\n\nالديموغرافيا السكانيه\nتعداد السكان تاريخياً\nحسب المؤرخ شيخ كامل الغزي، فان تعداد حلب بلغ حوالي 400,000 نسمه قبل زلزله حلب الكبرى. والذي تبعه انتشار موجه من الطاعون والكوليرا في اعوام 1823 و1827. ادت هذه الكوارث الى انخفاض عدد السكان بشكل حاد ليصل 110,000 في نهايات القرن التاسع عشر  في عام 1901، بلغ التعداد الكلي لمدينه حلب 108,143 نسمه شكل المسلمون منهم 76,329 نسمه بنسبه (70.58%)، بينما شكل المسيحيون 24,508 نسمه (22.66%)، واليهود نسبه 7,306 (6.76%).\n\nالنازحون الارمن لمدينه حلب\nالا ان تعداد سكان المدينه عاد ليزداد بعد استقبالها للنازحين الارمن في بدايات القرن العشرين (1915–1922). وصل التعداد السكاني للمدينه عام 1922 الى 156,748 شكل المسلمون منهم 97,600 (62.26%)، المسيحيون 22,117 (14.11%)، اليهود 6,580 (4.20%)، الارمن 20,007 (12.76%)، وجنسيات اخرى 7,792 (4.97%).جاءت الموجه الثانيه للنازحين الارمن مع انسحاب القوات الفرنسيه من كيليكيه عام 1923.، وذلك بعد وصول اكثر من 40,000 الف لاجئ ارمني بين 1923-1925، ووصل التعداد الكلي للمدينه الى 210,000 نسمه مع نهايه عام 1925 وشكل الارمن ربع السكان.\nوفقاً للمعطيات التاريخيه المقدمه من قبل شيخ كامل الغزي، فان الغالبيه من مسيحيي المدينه كانوا من الكاثوليك حتى نهايات فتره الحكم العثماني. ان ازدياد اعداد المسيحيين الاورثودوكس ارتبطت بقدوم النازحين الارمن من ارمينيا ومرتفعات تركيا الجنوبيه، ومن الناحيه الاخرى لتدفق اعداد من النازحين الاورثودوكس عند تهجيرهم من لواء الاسكندرونه عندما تم الحاق سنجق الاسكندرونه عام 1939 بتركيا.في عام 1944، كان تعداد السكان حوالي 325,000، شكل المسيحيون منهم حوالي 112,110 (34.5%) نصفهم من الارمن 60,200.\nكانت مدينه حلب تضم تعدادا هاما من اليهود ايضاً في العصور القديمه. وبها معبد يهودي بني في القرن الخامس الميلادي. كانت احياء اليهود التقليديه تشمل احياء الجميليه، باب النصر، والمناطق المجاوره للمعبد.\nثم بدات موجات هجره اليهود نحو فلسطين تظهر بعد اعلان قيام دوله اسرائيل من طرف واحد من قبل المهاجرين اليهود الاوروبيين ومع تواطؤ كل من بريطانيا والولايات المتحده الامريكيه.\nعام 1968، كان لا يزال يقطن مدينه حلب اكثر من 700 يهودي على الاقل \nحاولت الحكومه السوريه بدايه الحفاظ على الرعايا اليهود؛ فمثلاً وحتى يومنا هذا، ظلت املاك اليهود غير مسكونه حتى بعد هجرتهم، اذ تركت الحكومه السوريه حجوزاتها على المساكن شريطه ان لا يهاجر الرعايا اليهود السوريون الى الاراضي التي احتلها الكيان الاسرائيلي. الا ان معظم اليهود قد هاجروا بدايهً الى الولايات المتحده الامريكيه، ليشكلوا جاليه معتبره في بروكلين - نيويورك بشكل اساسي، اما البقيه فقد غادروها في النهايه وتوجهوا الى اسرائيل.\n\nالوضع الديموغرافي الحالي وتناغم السكان\nالمدينه حالياً هي الاكثر كثافهً سكانياً في القطر، مع تعداد وصل حتى 2,181,061 نسمه وفق ارقام مسح عام 2004. وفي اواخر العام 2005 اعلن مجلس المدينه وصول التعداد الى 2,301,570 مليون نسمه.\nغالبيه سكان حلب هم العرب واقليه من الاكراد و‌الارمن والشركس والتركمان وغيرهم، وتتجانس فيها الاثنيات والاديان منذ القدم لتتمتع المدينه بالتنوع والمشاركه والتعاون بين كافه الاعراق والطوائف من السكان بشكل رائع وجميل يعتبر مضرباً للمثل في الشرق الاوسط.\nتقريبا 85% من سكان حلب هم من المسلمين السنه العرب، وسكان حلب من الديانه المسيحيه هم التجمع الثاني من حيث الحجم بعد مدينه بيروت (بين 10% و15%) في المنطقه، وتحتضن بين جنباتها حوالي 45 كنيسه او مبنى كنسي تنتمي للطوائف المتنوعه فهناك السريان واللاتين والموارنه والكاثوليك والارثوذكس والكلدانيين يتعايشون جميعاً في جو من الود والاخاء. كانت حلب ايضًا موطنًا لاحدى اغنى المجتمعات المسيحيه الشرقيه واكثرها تنوعًا في الشرق، تاريخياً قطن المسيحيون في احياء معروفه مثل الجديده والعزيزيه والسليمانيه، محطه بغداد، العروبه والميدان. وان بدؤوا بالانتشار خارج هذه الاحياء التقليديه مع ازدياد عدد السكان وظهور الاحياء السكنيه الحديثه. قبل الحرب الاهليه السوريه كانت مدينه حلب ثالث مدينه في الشرق الاوسط بعد القاهره وبيروت من حيث عدد المسيحيين،  حيث ضمت المدينه قبل الحرب الاهليه السوريه بين 160,000 الى 250,000 مسيحي.\nيتميز اهل حلب بلهجتهم المحليه المميزه والتي تستعير كثيراً من الكلمات من اللغه التركيه نظراً لقرب المسافه الجغرافيه.\n\nالديانه\nالاسلام\nاكثر من 80% من سكان حلب هم من المسلمين السُنّه، وهم اساساً من العرب، ويليهم كل من التركمان والاكراد. تشمل الجماعات الاسلاميه الاخرى اعدادًا صغيره من الشركس والشيشانيين والالبان والبوشناق واليونانيين والبلغار.\nالمناطق الشماليه الغربيه من حلب، ولا سيما حي الشيخ مقصود، يقطنها الاكراد بشكل رئيسي. منذ بدايه الحرب الاهليه السوريه، تتم حمايه هذه المناطق من حلب بواسطه الميليشيات الكرديه، وبالتالي فهي اكثر المناطق امانًا بالمقارنه مع باقي المناطق في حلب. لم تتحدَّ قوات الحكومه المركزيه او جيوش المتمردين الجيش الكردي ولم تتعد على المناطق الكرديه. العديد من غير الاكراد في حلب فروا الى الاحياء الخاضعه للسيطره الكرديه. وشكلّ الاكراد حوالي 7% الى 10% من سكان المدينه قبل الحرب.\n\nالمسيحيه\nكانت حلب ايضًا موطنًا لاحدى اغنى المجتمعات المسيحيه الشرقيه واكثرها تنوعًا في الشرق. وتاريخياً خصوصًا خلال الحكم العثماني عمل المسيحيون في التجاره واقاموا في احياء خاصه فيهم ابرزها الجديّده، وشيّدت في الحي ذاته بيوت فخمه تدل على ثراء ورفاهيه اصحابها، فضلًا عن مختلف المرافق التي تتيح لهذا الحيّ ان يعيش حياته المستقله منها حمامات عامه مثل حمام برهم. في تلك الحقبه كان مسيحيو حلب اكثر ثراءً من المسلمين. كانت الطوائف الارثوذكسيه وغيرها من الطوائف المسيحيه تزداد ثروه وثقافه ونفوذًا طوال القرن الثامن عشر. فالحمايه الاجنبيه لم تمنحها امتيازات سياسيه فحسب، بل وفرت لابنائها ايضًا، وهم العاملون بالتجاره مع اوروبا في ذلك الحين، منافع تجاريه وماليه. وقد اغتنى، بنوع خاص، اليونانيون والارمن والمسيحيون السوريون الناطقون بالضاد، فارتفع مع هذا الغنى مستواهم الثقافي واشتد شعورهم الطائفي. خلال القرن الثامن عشر ازدهرت الحياه الثقافيه وقام في حلب نخبه من الادباء والمفكّرين المسيحيين كان لهم دور في النهضه العربيه الحديثه. وقام المسيحيون بدور كبير في عهد الانتداب وكانوا العمود الفقري لاهم الدوائر والمؤسسات ولمعوا في المهن الحرّه كالطب والمحاماه والهندسه كما تابعوا نشاطهم التجاري التقليدي متاقلمين مع الاوضاع الجديده. وظلّت الطبقه العامله تتقن المهن التقليديه كالبناء، والنسيج وعملوا على ادخال التصنيع الحديث. ونبغ خاصه الارمن في الصناعات الميكانيكيه ومن «مهاجرين» اصبحوا ارباب عمل ونخبه ثريّه. وساهم المسيحيون في الحياه السياسيه كنوّاب ووزراء وعملوا مع اخوانهم المسلمين للحصول على الاستقلال التام. كانت الغالبيه من مسيحيي المدينه من الكاثوليك حتى نهايات فتره الحكم العثماني، وقد ارتبط ازدياد اعداد المسيحيين الارثوذكس المشرقيين بقدوم النازحين الارمن والسريان من قيليقيه وطور عبدين في تركيا هربًا من الاباده الجماعيه الارمنيه والسريانيه، ومن الناحيه الاخرى لتدفق اعداد من النازحين الارثوذكس العرب (روم انطاكيون) عند تهجيرهم من لواء الاسكندرون عندما تم الحاق سنجق الاسكندرونه عام 1939 بتركيا. في عام 1944، كان تعداد السكان حوالي 325,000 نسمه وشكّل المسيحيون حوالي 112,110 (34.5%) وكان نصفهم من الارمن اي 60,200 نسمه.\nقبل الحرب الاهليه السوريه كانت مدينه حلب ثالث مدينه في الشرق الاوسط بعد القاهره وبيروت من حيث عدد المسيحيين،  حيث ضمت المدينه قبل الحرب الاهليه السوريه بين 160,000 الى 250,000 مسيحي. مع تواجد للعديد من الطوائف المسيحيه الشرقيه، وخاصهً من الارمن والسريان. تاريخياً كانت المدينه المركز الرئيسي للمبشرين الكاثوليك الفرنسيين في سوريا. وكان عدد سكان حلب المسيحيين اكثر بقليل من 250,000 نسمه قبل الحرب الاهليه السوريه، وهو ما يمثل حوالي 12% من اجمالي سكان المدينه. ومع ذلك، نتيجه للحرب الاهليه السوريه، انخفض عدد السكان المسيحيين في المدينه الى اقل من 100,000 اعتبارًا من بدايه عام 2017، وكان منهم حوالي 30% من الاثنيه الارمنيه. ويتحدث عدد كبير من السريان في حلب اللغه السريانيه، وينحدرون من مدينه اورفه في تركيا، ويتبعون في الغالب الكنيسه السريانيه الارثوذكسيه والكنيسه السريانيه الكاثوليكيه. ومع ذلك، هناك وجود كبير لاتباع بطريركيه انطاكيه وسائر المشرق للروم الارثوذكس. هناك ايضاً عدد كبير من المسيحيين الكاثوليك الشرقيين في المدينه بما في ذلك الروم الملكيين والموارنه والكلدان واتباع الطقوس اللاتينيه. المسيحيون البروتستانت من مختلف الطوائف هم اقليه في المدينه.\nتتمتع العديد من احياء المدينه باغلبيه مسيحيه وارمنيه، مثل الحي المسيحي القديم في الجديده. وتعمل حوالي 50 كنيسه في المدينه والتي تديرها مختلف الطوائف المسيحيه. ومع ذلك، وفقًا لنائب رئيس لجنه اليونسكو التابعه للاتحاد الروسي الكساندر دزاسوخوف، عانت حوالي 20 كنيسه من الدمار الشديد خلال المعارك في حلب،  وابرزها الوطنيه الكنيسه الانجيليه، وكذلك الكنائس التاريخيه المحيطه بحي الجديده. وفي 25 ديسمبر من عام 2016، بعد انتصار الحكومه، تم الاحتفال بعيد الميلاد علانيه في حلب لاول مره منذ اربع سنوات.\n\nاليهوديه\nكانت المدينه موطناً لعدد كبير من السكان اليهود منذ العصور القديمه. وتم بناء الكنيس العظيم في القرن الخامس، وضم الكنيس مخطوطه حلب. عُرف يهود حلب بالتزامهم الديني والقياده الحاخاميه والليتورجيه، والتي تكونت من البيزمونيم والبقشوت. بعد ظهور محاكم التفتيش الاسبانيه، استقبلت مدينه حلب العديد من المهاجرين اليهود السفارديم، الذين انضموا في النهايه الى الجاليه اليهوديه المحليه في حلب. كانت هناك علاقات سلميه بين اليهود والسكان المحيطين بهم. في اوائل القرن العشرين، كان يهود المدينه يعيشون بشكل رئيسي في حي الجميليه وباب الفرج والاحياء المحيطه بالكنيس الكبير. ادت الاضطرابات في فلسطين في السنوات التي سبقت قيام دوله اسرائيل في عام 1948 الى تزايد العداء لليهود الذين يعيشون في البلدان العربيه، وبلغت ذروتها في الهجره اليهوديه من الاراضي العربيه. هاجم حشد عربي الحي اليهودي في ديسمبر من عام 1947 عقب قرار الامم المتحده بتقسيم فلسطين. وتعرضت المنازل والمدارس والمتاجر لاضرار بالغه. بعد فتره وجيزه، هاجر العديد من يهود المدينه البالغ تعدادهم سته الاف. وفي عام 1968 كان هناك ما يقرب من 700 يهودي لا يزالون في حلب.\nلم يتم بيع المنازل والممتلكات الاخرى للعائلات اليهوديه بعد الهجره، ولا تزال غير ماهوله تحت حمايه الحكومه السوريه. معظم هذه العقارات موجوده في مناطق الجميليه وباب الفرج والاحياء المحيطه بالكنيس المركزي في حلب. في عام 1992، رفعت الحكومه السوريه حظر السفر على 4,500 مواطن يهودي. وسافر معظمهم الى الولايات المتحده، حيث يعيش عدد كبير من اليهود السوريين حاليًا في بروكلين في نيويورك. تم اجلاء اخر يهود حلب المُتبقين في المدينه، من افراد عائله الحلبي، في اكتوبر عام 2016 من قبل الجيش السوري الحر، وتعيش العائله الان في اسرائيل.\n\nالطراز المعماري\nتتميز مدينه حلب بتعدد الطرز المعماريه الموجوده فيها، اذ تجمع انماطاً معماريهً سلجوقيه وبيزنطيهً اضافهً للطرز المملوكيه والعثمانيه، ممن تعاقبوا عليها على مر السنين.\nيوجد في المدينه العديد من المباني القديمه العائده للقرنين الثالث والرابع عشر ميلادي، مثل الخانات والمدارس الدينيه والحمامات، اضافهً للمباني الدينيه كالجوامع والكنائس.\nوظهرت في حلب في القرنين السادس والسابع عشر بيوت مملوكه للعديد من العائلات الحلبيه الثريه تتميز بواجهاتها الحجريه الغايه في الجمال، في القرن ال 19 ومطلع القرن العشرين كان طراز العماره الباروكيه هو السائد، ومثاله بناء فيلا روز الشهير في منطقه العزيزيه. بينما يجمع حي الشهباء الجديده الراقي العديد من الطرز المعماريه الشرقيه، والكلاسيكيه الغربيه وحتى الصينيه\nوذلك بفضل مهاره الصناع الحلبيين في قد الصخور، خصوصاً من الحجر الابيض الذي تشتهر به مدينه حلب.\n\nمعالم المدينه القديمه\nيوجد نسبياً انقسام واضح بين حدود المدينه القديمه والمدينه الحديثه في حلب. الجزء القديم موجودٌ ضمن جدار المدينه القديم الذي يشكل دائرهً نصف قطرها 5 كيلومترات، وله 9 بوابات. (باستثناء حي الجديده الذي بني بعد الغزوات المغوليه في القرن الخامس عشر عل الرغم انه يعد جزءاً من المدينه القديمه) في مركز المدينه القديمه تقع قلعه حلب الضخمه على تله مرتفعه، مشرفه بذلك على كافه احياء المدينه القديمه. ويتوسطها مدرجٌ واسع هو مدرج القلعه الذي تقام فيه العديد من الحفلات.\n\nابواب حلب القديمه\nابواب حلب جزءٌ اساسي ومهم من السور، ومن ذاكره المدينه، فقد كانت هذه الابواب منفذ اهل حلب عبر السور المنيع الذي رد عنهم هجمات الغزاه على مر العصور، حتى انه يمكن القول ان كل ضربه سيف او سقطه رمح او طلقه منجنيق، لابد انها وقد تركت اثراً او حفره او ندبه على هذه الابواب. عدد هذه الابواب تسعه، اندثر منها اربعه وحوفظ على خمسه منها في المدينه القديمه:\n\nباب الحديد\nباب انطاكيه\nباب النصر\nباب قنسرين\nباب الفرج\nباب المقام\nباب الجنان او باب جنين في اللهجه الحلبيه.\nباب الاحمر\nباب النيرب\n\nالحفاظ على المدينه القديمه\nباعتبارها مدينهً ذات طرازٍ معماري قديم تميزه الاسواق المسقوفه والخانات والحمامات والمدارس، اضافهً للمساجد والكنائس، فان المدينه كنزُ اثري بحاجه للعنايه والصيانه المستمره. تمت اعاده تخطيط المدينه بشكل واضح بعد انتهاء الحرب العالميه الثانيه. وفي عام 1954 اعتمد مخطط معماري من قبل المعماري الفرنسي اندريه جوتون، والذي اقترح شق عددٍ من الجادات العريضه عبر المدينه لتتناسب مع دخول السيارات. بين اعوام 1954-1983 تم هدم العديد من الاحياء القديمه تحت هذه الذريعه بغرض التوسع، خصوصاً في المناطق الشماليه مثل باب الفرج وباب جنين لكن الوعي المتزايد باهميه هذه المباني ادى في النهايه لالغاء مخطط جوتون عام 1979 وليتم الاستعاضه عنه بتخطيط لمهندس المدن السويسري ستيفانو بيانكو، والذي اطلق فكره المحافظه على النسيج العمراني القديم لحلب القديمه. الامر الذي مهد الطريق لليونسكو لتضم مدينه حلب القديمه الى التراث العالمي عام 1986.\nقام العديد من المعاهد العالميه بالتضافر مع الجهات المحليه وجمعيه اثار حلب، لاعاده تاهيل المدينه القديمه باضافه نمط حياه عصري اليها مع المحافظه على الطابع التراثي.\nتقوم هنالك شراكه بين مؤسسه المانيا التقنيه GTZ و‌مؤسسه الاغا خان ضمن برنامج الاغا خان لحمايه المدن القديمه ساهمت في كثير من الاعمال للحفاظ وتاهيل المدينه القديمه\n\nالاسواق والخانات في مدينه حلب\nمدينه حلب مدينهُ تجاريه بامتياز، فقد جذب موقع المدينه الاستراتيجي على طريق الحرير العديد من السكان من كافه الاعراق والمعتقدات ليقطنوا فيها ويستفيدوا من وقوعها بين الصين وبلاد الرافدين من الشرق واوروبا من الغرب، ومصر في الجنوب. تحتوي حلب على اكبر سوقٍ شرقيٍ مسقوفٍ في العالم، بمساحهٍ كليه تصل حتى 16 هيكتاراً وبطولٍ يصل حتى 16 كيلومتراً\nتعتبر منطقه المدينه المنطقه التجاريه النشطه للبضاعات المستورده، مثل الحرير القادم من ايران، التوابل والبهارات القادمه من الهند. والقهوه والاقمشه القادمه من دمشق. تعتبر المدينه ايضاً موطن الصناعات المحليه كالقطن، المنتجات الزراعيه، وصابون الغار الذي تشتهر به مدينه حلب. شيدت معظم اجزاء السوق في القرن الرابع عشر وسميت حسب اسماء الحرف والمهن المزاوله فيها، مثل سوق الصوف، سوق الصاغه، وقس على ذلك.. بالاضافه للتجاره، فان السوق منح للتجار ولبضائعهم خانات متواجده حول الاسواق. اخذت الخانات ايضاً اسماءها عن مواقعها وحرفه السوق الواقع فيه، وتتميز هذه الخانات بواجهاتها الجميله المحصنه بالابواب الخشبيه المتينه.\n\nالاسواقُ والخاناتُ التاريخيه\nالاسواق

مشهوره باطباقها اللذيذه وبحب اهلها للقمه الهنيئه، ويُقال (حلب ارض المحاشي والكبب) او كما يُقال بين السكان المحليين (حلب ام المحاشي والكبب)، لذلك ليس من المفاجئ بان يفوز مطبخها بجائزه التذوق العالميه من قبل اكاديميه الطهي والتذوق العالميه من فرنسا عام 2007\nولكن في الحقيقه، فان حلب كانت عاصمهً للطبخ قبل جائزه باريس بكثير، ربما يعود السبب الى تمازج عديد من الاثنيات فيها، الامر الذي ساعد على تعدد انواع الاطباق، نظراً لانها كانت جزءاً من الدوله العثمانيه. فهي تحتوي على الكثير من الاصناف مثل الكباب، الكبه، اليبرق (محشي ورق العنب)، محاشي الباذنجان والكوسا، اللحمه بالكرز، السماقيه، السفرجليه.\nيعتبر افطار الفول المدمس افطاراً تقليدياً في مدينه حلب، مضافاً اليه الزيت وعصير الليمون والفلفل الاحمر. وتعتبر الكبه احد اختصاصات المطبخ الحلبي الاثيره واكثر اكله محبوبه من قبل السكان، ابتكر الحلبيون اكثر من 17 نوعاً من انواع الكبب المشهوره في الديار الشاميه.\nحلب ايضاً مركزُ هام لصناعه الحلويات، والتي تتميز باحتوائها على نسب كبيره من الزبده والسكر، مثل المبرومه، سوار الست، البللوريه، بالاضافه لاصنافٍ اخرى مثل المامونيه، الشعيبيات، المشبك، الزلابيه، غزل البنات. وتتضمن معظم هذه الحلويات الجوز والقشطه و‌الفستق الحلبي الشهير.\n\nالرياضه\nتعتبر كره القدم اللعبه الاكثر شعبيه

والمواصلات\nالسكك الحديديه\nكانت مدينه حلب من المدن الاولى في سوريا التي تصلها خطوط النقل الحديدي، وذلك عندما قامت السلطات العثمانيه ببناء سكه حديد بغداد عبر المدينه عام 1919 (ومنها اخذت محطه القطار اسمها محطه بغداد)، والتي تمتد حتى انقره وما تزال موجودهً حتى يومنا هذا، وتوجد ايضاً خطوط تصل ما بين حلب ودمشق ضمن خط حديد الحجاز الشهير الذي انشئ ايضاً بدعم من الامبراطور غليوم الالماني بغرض تسهيل نقل الحجاج الى الحرمين الشريفين في الحجاز وحتى اسطنبول، ولهذه الاسباب التاريخيه يتواجد مقر شركه الخطوط الحديديه السوريه في حلب وليس في دمشق. نظراً لقدم عمر هذه الشبكات فقد تباطات حركه الشحن والنقل للمسافرين خصوصاً نحو ميناء اللاذقيه، الا ان هذه الحركه عادت لتنشط 2005 مع استقدام قطارات الترين سيت الكوريه الجنوبيه لتصبح هناك رحلات منتظمه لكل من اللاذقيه ودمشق كل ساعتين، مع خدمه جيده المستوى.\n\nالمطار\nيخدم المدينه مطار دولي يعتبر الحظيره الثانيه لطائرات الخطوط الجويه السوريه، تعود بداياته لاوائل القرن العشرين، وتم بناؤه تدريجياً وتطويره حتى عام 1999 عندما اعتُمدت قاعه المطار الجديده.\n\nالتخطيط المستدام في حلب\nيعتبر التخطيط المستدام سمهً اساسيه لتطور المدن الحديثه، وكان لا بد للمدينه ان تهتم بهذا الجانب من اجل الحفاظ على موقعها ومكانتها المحليه والدوليه، مما جعلها تنخرط في عدد من مشاريع التخطيط والتنميه المستدامه ورفع السويه الاداريه للموظفين.\nان التنميه العمرانيه المتكامله في مدينه حلب UDP هي ثمرهُ للتعاون بين الوكاله الالمانيه للتطور التقني ومجلس مدينه حلب. يهدف

تطوير الاداره المحليه للاتحاد الاوروبي، والمقرر ان يدوم بين عامي 2007 - 2016.\n\nالمدن الشقيقه واتفاقيات التوامه\nحالياً توجد لحلب علاقه تعاون وتوامه مع اربع مدن:\n\n ازمير، تركيا منذ 5 ايار عام 1995\n ليون، فرنسا منذ 18 تشرين الاول عام 2000.\n غازي عنتاب، تركيا، منذ 13 تشرين الثاني عام 2005.\n برست بيلاروسيا منذ 28 كانون الثاني 2010.\n\nالاقتصاد\nالتجاره في حلب\nان وجود المدينه الاساسي كان معتمداً عبر العصور على موقعها المفتاحي الهام على طرق التجاره، ما بين الهند و‌الصين وبلاد الشام و‌البحر الابيض المتوسط و‌البحر الاحمر، كانت حلب المدينه الثالثه من حيث النشاط التجاري في العهد العثماني بعد اسطنبول و‌القاهره. تضرب التقاليد التجاريه بجذورها العميقه في المدينه وتسري في دمها، وهي مشهوره بطبقه تجارها المحنكين، واستمرت هذه الرياده حالياً مع انشاء غرفه تجاره حلب عام 1885، كواحده من اقدم غرف التجاره في الشرق الاوسط والعالم العربي.\n\nالصناعات التقليديه\nتم حفظ الصناعات اليدويه العريقه بشكل جيد في اجزاء حلب القديمه كالحفر والنقش على الزجاج والصناعات النحاسيه. حلب ايضاً مركزُ هام

          "summary": "حَلَب هي مدينة في شمال سوريا وهي مركز محافظة حلب التي تعد أكبر المحافظات السورية من ناحية تعداد السكان بعدد سكان رسمي يفوق 4.045 مليون (تقديرات 2004) كما أنها تعتبر العاصمة الاقتصادية لسوريا. تقع شمال غرب سوريا على بعد 310 كم (193 ميلاً) من دمشق. كما أنها تعد أكبر مدن بلاد الشام،  وكانت عاصمة لمملكة يمحاض الأمورية، وتعاقبت عليها بعد ذلك حضاراتٌ عدة مثل الحثية و‌الآرامية و‌الآشورية و‌الفارسية و‌الهيلينية و‌الرومانية و‌البيزنطية والإسلامية. وفي العصر العباسي برزت حلب كعاصمة للدولة الحمدانية التي امتدت من حلب إلى الجزيرة الفراتية و‌الموصل. تعد حلب واحدة من أقدم المدن المأهولة في العالم وثاني اقدم مدن سوريا بعد العاصمة دمشق وذلك منذ بداية الألفية السادسة قبل الميلاد، حيث أظهرت الحفريات في تل السودة وتل الأنصاري الواقعتين جنوب المدينة القديمة أن المنطقة كانت قد احتلت في الجزء الأخير من الألفية الثالثة على الأقل  ويظهر هذا في أول ذكر لحلب في الألواح المسمارية المكتشفة في مملكة إيبلا و‌بلاد الرافدين حيث لوحظ تفوقها العسكري والتجاري. مثل هذا التاريخ ربما يرجع إلى كونها نقطة تجارية إستراتيجية في منتصف الطريق بين البحر الأبيض المتوسط و‌بلاد الرافدين وفي كونها في نهاية طريق الحرير الذي يمر عبر آسيا الوسطى و‌بلاد الرافدين. وبقيت حلب لقرون أكبر المدن السورية وثالث مدينة في الدولة العثمانية بعد إسطنبول و‌القاهرة. تحولت التجارة إلى البحر عندما تم افتتاح قناة السويس عام 1869 وبدأت أهمية حلب بالتراجع بشكل بطيء. تلقت حلب أكبر الضربات عند بداية القرن العشرين، فعند سقوط الخلافة العثمانية بعد الحرب العالمية الأولى سلخت عن حلب أجزاؤها الشمالية (معظمها ضمن الأقاليم السورية الشمالية) التي ضمت إلى تركيا عام 1920 بالاتفاق بين أتاتورك و‌سلطات الانتداب الفرنسي. خسرت حلب التجارة مع مدن هذه الأقاليم خاصة المدن التي كانت تابعة لولاية حلب تاريخيا كعنتاب و‌مرعش و‌أضنة و‌مرسين، كما خسرت السكك الحديدية المهمّة التي كانت تصلها بالموصل. أدت اتفاقية سايكس بيكو وفصل العراق عن سورية إلى كساد وتدهور كبير في اقتصاد حلب. وفي عام 1940 فقدت حلب إمكانية وصولها إلى البحر بعد خسارتها لمنفذها الرئيسي على البحر الأبيض المتوسط في الإسكندرونة. تراجع موقع حلب السياسي بسبب جعل مدينة دمشق عاصمة لسوريا. رغم كل هذه الضربات، بقيت هذه المدينة عاصمة اقتصادية لسوريا، فهي تضم أهم المعامل الصناعية وهي أيضا تشكل مركزا للمناطق الزراعية في سوريا، وخاصة زراعة القطن الضرورية لمعامل النسيج المزدهرة في المدينة. كانت حلب وريفها تعطي معظم الناتج الإجمالي السوري حتى نهاية الخمسينات  أصبحت المدينة القديمة في مدينة حلب من مواقع التراث العالمي اليونسكو في عام 1986. وقد نالت المدينة لقب عاصمة الثقافة الإسلامية عن الوطن العربي في عام 2006 م. وخلال أحداث الأزمة السورية، تضررت حلب بشكل كبير إنسانيا واقتصاديا بفعل القتال والقصف ونقل المعامل إلى تركيا، وتوقفت عجلة الاقتصاد في المدينة وتعرض الكثير من معالمها الأثرية للدمار مثل مئذنة المسجد الأموي واحتراق معظم أسواق حلب القديمة.",

          "content": "The Citadel of Aleppo (Arabic: قلعة حلب, romanized: Qalʿat Ḥalab) is a large medieval fortified palace in the centre of the old city of Aleppo, northern Syria. It is considered to be one of the oldest and largest castles in the world. Usage of the Citadel hill dates back at least to the middle of the 3rd millennium BC. Occupied by many civilizations over time – including the Arameans, Assyrians, Greeks, Arabs, Armenians, Romans, Byzantines, Ayyubids, Mamluks and Ottomans  – the majority of the construction as it stands today is thought to originate from the Ayyubid period. An extensive conservation work took place in the 2000s by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, in collaboration with Aleppo Archeological Society. Dominating the city, the Citadel is part of the Ancient City of Aleppo, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986. During the 2010s, the Citadel received significant damage during the lengthy Battle of Aleppo. It was reopened to the public in early 2018 with repairs to damaged parts underway, though some of the damage will be purposefully preserved as part of the history of the citadel. The citadel was damaged by the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake.\n\nHistory\nThe recently discovered temple of the ancient storm-god Hadad dates use of the hill to the middle of the 3rd millennium BC, as referenced in cuneiform texts from Ebla and Mari. The city became the capital of Yamhad and was known as the \"City of Hadad\". The temple remained in use from the 24th century BC to at least the 9th century BC, as evidenced by reliefs discovered at it during excavations by German archaeologist Kay Kohlmeyer.\nAfter the decline of the Neo-Hittite Empire centered in Aleppo, the Neo-Assyrian Empire ruled the area (8th–7th century BC), followed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire and the Achaemenid Empire (539–333 BC).\n\nSeleucid period\nAfter Aleppo was conquered by the armies of Alexander the Great, the area was ruled by Seleucus I Nicator, who undertook the revival of the city under the name Beroia. Medieval Arab historians say that the history of the citadel as a fortified acropolis began under Seleucus I Nicator. In some areas of the citadel there are up to two meters of remains of Hellenistic settlement. A colonnaded street led up to the citadel hill from the west, where the south area of Aleppo still retains the Hellenistic grid street plan.\n\nRoman and Byzantine periods\nAfter the Romans destroyed the Seleucid dynasty in 64 BC, the citadel hill continued to have religious significance. Emperor Julian, in his visit in 363 to Aleppo noted \"I stayed there for a day, visited the acropolis, offered a white bull to Zeus according to imperial customs, and held a short talk with the town council about worshiping the deities.\" Very few physical remains have been found from the Roman age in the Citadel.\nThe Roman Empire was divided into two parts in 395. Aleppo was in the eastern half, Byzantine Empire. During the clashes with the Sassanian king Khosrow II in the 7th century, the population of Aleppo is said to have taken refuge in the Citadel because the city wall was in a deplorable state. Currently, very few remains from the Byzantine period have been found on the Citadel Hill, although the two mosques inside the Citadel are known to be converted from churches originally built by the Byzantines.\n\nEarly Islamic period\nAleppo was captured by the Arab armies in 636, during the Muslim conquest of the Levant. Written sources document repairs being made on the citadel after a major earthquake. Little is known about the citadel in the period of early Christianity and Islam, except that Aleppo was a frontier town on the edges of the Byzantine, Umayyad and Abbasid empires.\nSayf al-Dawla, a Hamdanid prince, conquered the city in 944, and it subsequently rose to a political and economic renaissance. The Hamdanids built a reputedly splendid palace on the banks of the river, but moved to the Citadel after Byzantine troops sacked the city in 962. A period of instability followed Hamdanid rule, marked by Byzantine and Bedouin attacks, as well as a short-term rule by the Egypt-based Fatimids. The Mirdasids were said to have converted the two churches into mosques.\n\nZengid and Ayyubid periods\nThe citadel rose to the peak of its importance in the period during and after the Crusader presence in the Near East. Zengid ruler Imad ad-Din Zengi – followed by his son Nur ad-Din (ruled 1147–1174) – successfully unified Aleppo and Damascus and held back the Crusaders from their repeated assaults on the cities. Several famous crusaders were imprisoned in the citadel, among them Count of Edessa, Joscelin II, who died there, Raynald of Châtillon, and the King of Jerusalem, Baldwin II, who was held for two years. In addition to his many works in both Aleppo and Damascus, Nur ad-Din rebuilt the Aleppo city walls and fortified the citadel. Arab sources report that he also made several other improvements, such as a high, brick-walled entrance ramp, a palace, and a racecourse likely covered with grass. Nur ad-Din additionally restored or rebuilt the two mosques and donated an elaborate wooden mihrab (prayer niche) to the Mosque of Abraham. The mihrab disappeared during the French Mandate when it was destroyed.\nSaladin's son, al-Zahir al-Ghazi, ruled Aleppo from 1193 to 1215. During this time, the citadel went through major reconstruction, fortification and addition of new structures that create the complex of the Citadel in its current form today. Sultan Ghazi strengthened the walls, smoothed the surface of the outcrop and covered sections of the slope at the entrance area with stone cladding. The depth of the moat was increased, connected with water canals and spanned by a tall bridge-cum-viaduct, which today still serves as the entrance into the Citadel. During the first decade of the 13th century, the citadel evolved into a palatial city that included functions ranging from residential (palaces and baths), religious (mosque and shrines), military installations (arsenal, training ground, defence towers and the entrance block) and supporting elements (water cisterns and granaries). The most prominent renovation is the entrance block rebuilt in 1213. Sultan Ghazi also had the two mosques on the Citadel restored, and expanded the city walls to include the southern and eastern suburbs, making the citadel the centre of the fortifications, rather than alongside the wall.\n\nMongol and Mamluk periods\nThe citadel was damaged by the Mongol invasion of 1260 and again destroyed by the invasion led by the Turco-Mongol leader Timur which swept through Aleppo in 1400–1401.\nIn 1415, the Mamluk governor of Aleppo, prince Sayf al-Din, was authorized to rebuild the citadel, which by then stood at the centre of a significant trading city of between 50,000–100,000 inhabitants. Sayf al-Din's additions included two new advance towers on the north and south slopes of the citadel, and the new Mamluk palace built on top of the higher of the two entrance towers. The Ayyubid palace was almost completely abandoned during this period. The Mamluk period also administered restoration and preservation projects on the Citadel. The final Mamluk sultan, al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri, replaced the flat ceiling of the Throne Hall with nine domes.\n\nOttoman period\nDuring the Ottoman period, the military role of the citadel as a defense fortress slowly diminished as the city began to grow outside the city walls and was taking its form as a commercial metropolis. The Citadel was still used as a barracks for Ottoman soldiers, although it is not known exactly how many were stationed there. An anonymous Venetian traveler mentions some 2,000 people living in the Citadel in 1556. In 1679, the French consul d’Arvieux reports 1,400 people there, 350 of whom were Janissaries, the elite military corps in the service of the Ottoman Empire. Sultan Süleyman ordered a restoration of the citadel in 1521.\nAleppo and the citadel were heavily damaged in the earthquake of 1822. After the earthquake only soldiers lived in the citadel. The Ottoman Governor of the time, Ibrahim Pasha, used stones from destroyed buildings in the citadel to build a barracks in the north of the crown. It was later restored under the rule of Sultan Abdülmecid in 1850–1851. A windmill, also on the northern edge of the crown, was probably built around the same time.\n\nFrench Mandate\nSoldiers continued to be stationed in the citadel during the French Mandate (1920–1945). The French began archaeological excavations and extensive restoration work in the 1930s, particularly on the perimeter wall. The Mamluk Throne Hall was also completely restored during this time and given a new flat roof decorated in 19th-century Damascene style. A modern amphitheater was constructed on a section of an unexcavated surface of the citadel in 1980 to hold events and concerts.\n\nModern day\nThe citadel in its present form is on a mound, which has an elliptical base with a length of 450 metres (1,480 feet) and width of 325 metres (1,066 feet). At the top this ellipse measures 285 metres (935 feet) by 160 metres (520 feet) with the height of this slanting foundation measuring 50 metres (160 feet). In the past, the entire mound was covered with large blocks of gleaming limestone, some of which still remain today.\nThe mound is surrounded by a 22-metre-deep (72-foot) and 30-metre-wide (98-foot) moat, dating from the 12th century. Notable is the fortified gateway, accessible though an arched bridge. This feature was an addition from the Mamluk government in the 16th century. A succession of five right-angle turns and three large gates (with carved figures) leads to the main inner castle entrance. In the interior of the Citadel, are the Weapons' Hall, the Byzantine Hall and the Throne Hall, with a restored decorated ceiling. Prior to the Syrian civil war, the citadel was a tourist attraction and a site of archaeological digs and studies. The amphitheater was often used for musical concerts or cultural events.\n\nCivil war\nIn August 2012, during the Battle of Aleppo of the Syrian Civil War, the external gate of the citadel was damaged after being shelled during a clash between the Free Syrian Army and the Syrian Army to gain control over the citadel. In July 2015, a bomb was set off in a tunnel under one of the outer walls causing further damage to the citadel, in an attempt for the Free Syrian Army to dislodge the Syrian Army. During the conflict, the Syrian Army used the Citadel as a military base, and according to the opposition fighters, with the walls acting as cover while shelling surrounding areas and ancient arrow slits in walls being used by snipers to target rebels. As a result of this contemporary usage, the Citadel has received significant damage.\nThe citadel was extensively damaged by the magnitude 7.8 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake on 6 February 2023. On 17 February 2024, the Citadel of Aleppo was reopened after the completion of the first and second phase of the restoration of southern forward tower (the entrance to the citadel), which was greatly affected by the earthquake. Also other phases of the citadel's restoration have been revealed, including the entrance, the minaret of Great Ayyubid Mosque, and the façade of Throne Hall.\nTahrir al-Sham and other rebel forces captured the citadel on 29 November 2024, as part of the Second Battle of Aleppo.\n\nInternal sites\nThere are many structural remains inside the citadel. Notable sites include:\n\nEntrance block\nThe enormous stone bridge constructed by Sultan Ghazi over the moat led to an imposing bent entrance complex. Would-be assailants to the castle would have to take over six turns up a vaulted entrance ramp, over which were machicolations for pouring hot liquids on attackers from the mezzanine above. Secret passageways wind through the complex, and the main passages are decorated with figurative reliefs. The Ayyubid block is topped by the Mamluk \"Throne Hall\", a hall where Mamluk sultans entertained large audiences and held official functions.\n\nAyyubid Palace and Hammam\nGhazi's \"palace of glory\" burned down on his wedding night and he escaped with the queen, but it was later rebuilt and today stands as one of the most important and impressive monuments in the citadel crown. The Ayyubids were not the first to build a palace on the citadel. Today, numerous architectural details remain from the Ayyubid period, including an entrance portal with muqarnas, or honeycomb vaulting, and a courtyard on the four-iwan layout, with tiling.\nLaid out in traditional medieval Islamic style, the palace hammam has three sections. The first was used for dressing, undressing, and resting. The second was an unheated but warmer room, and this was followed by a hot room, and a steam room equipped with alcoves. Hot and cold water was piped through to the hammam with earthenware pipes.\n\nSatura, Hellenistic Well, and underground passages\nThe construction in the citadel was not confined to above-ground. Several wells penetrate down to 125 m (410 ft) below the surface of the crown. Underground passageways connect to the advance towers and possibly under the moat to the city.\n\nSee also\nList of castles in Syria\n\nReferences\nSources\nJulia Gonella, Wahid Khayyata, Kay Kohlmeyer: Die Zitadelle von Aleppo und der Tempel des Wettergottes.

          "summary": "The Citadel of Aleppo (Arabic: قلعة حلب, romanized: Qalʿat Ḥalab) is a large medieval fortified palace in the centre of the old city of Aleppo, northern Syria. It is considered to be one of the oldest and largest castles in the world. Usage of the Citadel hill dates back at least to the middle of the 3rd millennium BC. Occupied by many civilizations over time – including the Arameans, Assyrians, Greeks, Arabs, Armenians, Romans, Byzantines, Ayyubids, Mamluks and Ottomans  – the majority of the construction as it stands today is thought to originate from the Ayyubid period. An extensive conservation work took place in the 2000s by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, in collaboration with Aleppo Archeological Society. Dominating the city, the Citadel is part of the Ancient City of Aleppo, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986. During the 2010s, the Citadel received significant damage during the lengthy Battle of Aleppo. It was reopened to the public in early 2018 with repairs to damaged parts underway, though some of the damage will be purposefully preserved as part of the history of the citadel. The citadel was damaged by the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake.",

          "content": "The Great Mosque of Aleppo (Arabic: جَامِع حَلَب ٱلْكَبِيْر, romanized: Jāmiʿ Ḥalab al-Kabīr), also known as the Great Umayyad Mosque of Aleppo (Arabic: ٱلْجَامِع ٱلْأُمَوِي ٱلْكَبِيْر فِي حَلَب, romanized: Al-Jāmiʿ al-Umawī al-Kabīr fī Ḥalab), was the largest and one of the oldest mosques in the city of Aleppo, Syria, first built during the Umayyad Caliphate. The former mosque, now in partial ruins, is located in the al-Jalloum district of the Ancient City of Aleppo, a World Heritage Site, near the entrance to Al-Madina Souq. The mosque was purportedly home to the remains of Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist, both of whom are revered in Islam and Christianity. It was built in the beginning of the 8th century CE by the Muslim Arabs; and the current building dates from the 11th through 14th centuries. \nThe minaret in the mosque, built in 1090, was destroyed during fighting in the Syrian Civil War in April 2013. Between 2012 and 2016, the structure of the mosque sustained significant damage, including the collapse of parts of its walls, the burning of its prayer hall, and the loss of priceless historical artefacts. Work commenced in c. 2017 to restore the mosque and its minaret. The West Asia Post reported in 2024 that the mosque had been partially reopened; although other reports in late 2024 claimed that the mosque was still undergoing repairs. The mosque was partially reopened in 2025.\n\nHistory\nFounding\nThe site of the Great Mosque was once the agora of the Hellenistic period, which later became the garden for the Cathedral of Saint Helena during the Christian era of Roman rule in Syria.\nThe mosque was built on land that formerly was used as the Cathedral cemetery. The church itself was left and the area became a sacred place for both religions. According to later traditions, the construction of the earliest mosque on the site was commenced by the Umayyad caliph Al-Walid I in 715 and was finished by his successor Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik in 717. Architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell has attributed its construction solely to the latter, quoting 13th century Aleppine historian Ibn al-Adim who wrote Sulayman's intent was \"to make it equal to the work of his brother al-Walid in the Great Mosque at Damascus\". Another tradition claims al-Walid founded the mosque using materials from the so-called \"Church of Cyrrus\".\nHowever, architectural historian Jere L. Bacharach noted that the most likely patron of the mosque was Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik, a brother of al-Walid and Sulayman who was the governor of the local province (Jund Qinnasrin) sometime prior to 710 until at least the early period of Sulayman's rule. Accordingly, this would explain the belief that the mosque's construction took place during the reign of both caliphs. Moreover, Maslamah's governorship of Qinnasrin was largely ignored by the early Arabic historians, who focused their attention on his campaigns against the Byzantine Empire and the Armenians, and his governorship over the provinces of Iraq, Iranian Azerbaijan, Upper Mesopotamia and Armenia. Bacharach further states that Maslamah's commissioning of a large congregational mosque in Aleppo, a major base from which to attack the Byzantines, would have \"been appropriate, if not necessary\".\n\nRenovation\nIn the second half of the 11th century, the Mirdasids controlled Aleppo and built a single-domed fountain in the mosque's courtyard. At the northwest corner of the mosque, the 45-meter high minaret was built by the Shia Muslim qadi (\"chief Islamic judge\") of Aleppo, Abu'l Hasan Muhammad in 1090, during the reign of Seljuk governor Aq Sunqur al-Hajib. Its construction was finished in 1094 during Tutush's rule. The architect of the project was Hasan ibn Mufarraj al-Sarmini.\n\nThe mosque was restored and expanded by the Zengid sultan Nur al-Din in 1159 after a great fire that had destroyed the earlier Umayyad structure; In 1260, the mosque was razed by the Mongols. In 1281, the mosque was burned again by the Mongols, and the minbar was taken by the Armenians of Sis, according to Al-Mufaddal.\nThe Mamluks (1260–1516) made repairs and alterations. Carved Kufic and naskhi inscriptions decorated the entire minaret along with alternate bands of stylized ornaments in patterns and muqarnas. Sultan Qalawun replaced the burnt out mihrab (niche indicating the qibla, or direction to Mecca) in 1285. Later, Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad (1293–1341) had the new minbar (\"preacher's pulpit\") constructed during his reign.\nThe courtyard and minaret of the mosque were renovated in 2003.\n\nSyrian Civil War\nOn 13 October 2012 the mosque was seriously damaged during clashes between the armed groups of the Free Syrian Army and the Syrian Army forces. President Bashar al-Assad issued a presidential decree to form a committee to repair the mosque by the end of 2013.\nThe mosque was seized by rebel forces in early 2013, and, as of April 2013, was within an area of heavy fighting, with government forces stationed 200 meters (660 ft) away.\nOn the 24th of April, 2013, the minaret of the mosque was reduced to rubble during an exchange of heavy weapons fire between government forces and rebels during the ongoing Syrian civil war. The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported that members of Jabhat al-Nusra detonated explosives inside the minaret, while opposition activists said that the minaret was destroyed by Syrian Army tank fire as part of an offensive. Countering assertions by the state media of Jabhat al-Nusra's involvement, opposition sources described them as rebels from the Tawhid Brigades who were fighting government forces around the mosque. The opposition's main political bloc, the Syrian National Coalition (SNC), condemned the minaret's destruction, calling it \"an indelible disgrace\" and \"a crime against human civilization\". Syrians have begun rebuilding and restoring the site, with some meager international assistance.\n\nArchitecture\nCourtyard\nThe Great Mosque contains a number of architectural similarities to the Great Mosque of Damascus, including a hypostyle plan with large marbled courtyard surrounded by porticoes. The vast courtyard connects to different areas of the mosque, positioned behind the colonnaded arcade. The courtyard is well known for its alternating black and white stone floor that forms intricate geometric arrangements. Two ablutions fountains, both of which are roofed. The courtyard also has an open prayer estrade and a sundial.\n\nInterior\nThe ḥaram (\"sanctuary\") consists of the main prayer hall to the courtyard's south, which contains the primary elements of the mosque: the shrine of Zechariah, a 15th-century minbar (\"pulpit\"), and an elaborately carved miḥrāb (\"niche\"). Although the central entrance contains an inscription attributing its construction to Ottoman sultan Murad III, it was built by the Mamluks. The hall has three naves, all lined with 18 quadrangular columns with cross-vaults. This large prayer hall originally had a basic straight rooftop with a central qubbah (dome, but during Mamluk rule was replaced with an intricate cross-vaulted system with arches and a small dome over the arcades. The mihrab is deep and round and Zechariah's supposed tomb is to its left along the southern wall.\nThere are three other halls that abut the remaining sides of the courtyard. The eastern and northern halls each have two naves, while the western hall has one. The latter is mostly of modern construction. The east hall dates to the period of Malik Shah (1072–92) and the north hall was renovated during Mamluk sultan Barquq's reign (1382–1399), but largely maintained its original 11th century character.\n\nMinaret\nThe minaret's shaft, which protruded out of the flat roof of one of the halls, consisted of five levels with a crowning top encircled with a veranda. A muqarnas-style cornice divided the veranda top from the shaft. The structure was largely built of fine ashlar. The minaret was heavily decorated in relief ornament, more so than any other Islamic-era structure in Aleppo with the exception of the Shu'aybiyah Madrasa. Its stories contained cusped arches and continuous mouldings. The masonry of the minaret varied throughout, with a mix of light and heavy usage of toothed tools, short, long, vertical and horizontal strokes, fine and rough finishes, and small and large stones.\nAccording to E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, the minaret was \"quite unique in the whole of Muslim architecture\". Archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld described the architectural style of the minaret as being \"the product of Mediterranean civilization,\" writing that its four facades carried elements of Gothic architecture. Meanwhile, anthropologist Yasser Tabbaa stated the mosque was a continuation of the ancient North Syrian churches and \"an entirely localized phenomenon, centered mainly in the region between Aleppo and Edessa\".\n\nMaqsurah\nThe Great Mosque has a small museum annexed to it containing a number of ancient manuscripts. Similar to the Great Mosque of Damascus, a maqsurah was built in the form of a square domed room raised by one step above the floor level of the prayer hall, and adorned with Kashan tiles that cover all the internal surfaces of its walls. A large arched gate supported by two robust columns and topped with capitals as well as a bronze door screen comprise the entranceways to the maqsurah. The tomb containing the remains of the Prophet Zakariah, decorated with silver embroideries containing Quranic verses from the chapter of Mariyam, was located in the center of the room. The museum's number of valuable objects, including a box purportedly containing a strand of the Prophet Muhammad's hair, were subject to looting during the Syrian War in the 2013 clash. However, rebels claimed they had instead salvaged ancient handwritten Koranic manuscripts and hidden them.\n\nSee also\nCitadel of Aleppo\nSunni Islam in Syria\nList of mosques in Syria\nList of heritage sites damaged during the Syrian civil war\nReligious significance of the Syrian region\nUmayyad Mosque\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\n\"Great Mosque of Aleppo\".

Bacharach) رجّح بان يكون راعي المسجد كان مسلمه بن عبد الملك شقيق الوليد بن عبد الملك و‌سليمان بن عبد الملك، حيث شغل مسلمه منصب حاكم جند قنسرين قبيل عام 710 ميلادي حتى بدايه فتره حكم سليمان. وهذا تفسير الاعتقاد بان المسجد بني في عهد كلٍ من الخليفتين الوليد بن عبد الملك و‌سليمان بن عبد الملك. علاوه على ذلك فقد تم تجاهل حكم مسلمه بن عبد الملك لجند قنسرين من قبل المؤرخين العرب الاوائل، حيث انهم ركّزوا اهتماماتهم على حملاته ضد الامبراطوريه البيزنطيه و‌الارمن، وركزوا ايضاً على حكمه لمناطق العراق و‌اذربيجان واعالي بلاد ما بين النهرينو‌ارمينيا، وقد اشار المؤرخ المعماري ججيري باشاش على ان تكليف مسلمه بن عبد الملك ببناء جامع كبير في حلب والتي تعتبر قاعده رئيسيه لمهاجمه البيزنطيين قد «كان من المناسب، ان لم يكن من الضروري».\n\nالتجديد\nفي النصف الثاني من القرن الحادي عشر ميلادي، سيطر المرداسيون على حلب وقاموا ببناء النافوره المقببه (ذات القبه) في باحه المسجد. في الركن الشمالي الغربي بنى القاضي (رئيس المحكمه الاسلاميه في حلب) ابي الحسن محمد المئذنه بارتفاع 45 متراً في عام 1090 ميلادي  خلال عهد الحاكم السلجوقي اق سنقر الحاجب وتم الانتهاء من بنائها في عام 1094 ميلادي خلال فتره حكم السلطان السلجوقي تتش بن الب ارسلان. وكان المهندس المعماري للمشروع حسن بن مفرج ال سرميني.\n\nقام السلطان الزنكي نور الدين زنكي بترميم المسجد في عام 1159 ميلادي بعد حريق كبير دمّر المسجد في وقت سابق ;، الا ان المسجد هُدِمَ في عام 1260 على المغول.\n\nقام المماليك (1260-1516) بالقيام بعده اصلاحات وادخال العديد من التعديلات على المسجد، حيث زينت منحوتات كوفيه ونقوش المئذنه باكملها بدلاً من الزخارف التقليديه في النمط والمقرصنات. قام السلطان المملوكي المنصور قلاوون باستبدال المنبر المحترق في عام 1285 ميلادي، وفي وقت لاحق قام السلطان الناصر محمد بن قلاوون قام بوضع المنبر الحالي الذي بني خلال فتره حكمه.\n\nكما تم ترميم صحن المسجد (فناء المسجد) ومئذنته في عام 2003.\n\nالحرب الاهليه السوريه\nتاثر الجامع بالمعارك الدائره في حلب خلال الحرب الاهليه السوريه سنه 2013 وتعرضت مكتبته التاريخيه للحرق نتيجه للمعارك الدائره حول محيطه. كما انهارت مئذنته التاريخيه في 24 نيسان 2013 وسط اتهامات بين المعارضه والنظام. في يوم 13 اكتوبر 2012 لحقت اضرار جسيمه في المسجد جراء اشتباكات عنيفه دارت بين مسلحي المعارضه وقوات الجيش السوري. وقام الرئيس السوري بشار الاسد باصدار مرسوم بتكليف لجنه لاصلاح المسجد بحلول نهايه عام 2013.\n\nكما قام مسلحو المعارضه ببسط سيطرتهم على المسجد للمره الثانيه في اوائل عام 2013، ومنذ ابريل من العام 2013 اُعتبر المسجد من احد مناطق الاشتباكات بين مسلحي المعارضه وقوات الجيش السوري المتمركزه على بعد 200 متر (660 قدم).\n\nفي 24 ابريل انهارت مئذنه المسجد حيث استحالت المئذنه ركاماً خلال اشتباك بالاسلحه الثقيله بين قوات الجيش السوري والمعارضه خلال احداث معركه حلب وهي المعركه التي دارت في مدينه حلب شمال سوريا بهدف احكام السيطره على المدينه. كما وذكرت وكاله الانباء السوريه - سانا انا عناصر من جبهه النصره فجّروا عبوه ناسفه داخل المئذنه، في حين قال نشطاء من المعارضه ان المئذنه قد دُمرَت بقذيفه دبابه تابعه للجيش السوري في اطار هجومٍ كان قد شنّه الاخير للسيطره على المسجد.، ونقل بعض الناشطين نقلاً عن مسلحي المعارضه اتهامهم الجيش السوري بتفخيخ الجامع بالالغام لدى انسحابه، وقد قالوا ايضاً بانهم استطاعوا تفكيك جميع الالغام عدا التي كانت في المسجد عدا التي كانت في الرواق الشمالي والمئذنه بسبب كونها في الجهه الشماليه من المسجد وهي الجهه التي تطل على دوار السبع بحرات الذي لا يبعد اكثر من ثلاثمئه متر عن المسجد وحيث تتمركز قناصه قوات الجيش السوري بالمباني المحيطه بالدوار، وقد اوضح احد المسلحين المعارضين ان القناصه المطلون على المسجد كانوا قد كثفوا ضرباتهم على ساحه المسجد بغيه اعاقه تحركات الثوار المسيطرين على المسجد من جهه ومن جهه محاوله اعاده السيطره عليه والتي تترافق باشتباكات عنيفه من قبل قوات النظام التي تحاول التقدم نحو المسجد. في حين قال المرصد السوري انه «من الممكن ان تكون المئذنه انهارت من تلقاء نفسها بسبب اثار المعارك العنيفه خلال الاشهر الماضيه». كما وان مصادر المعارضه ردت على وسائل الاعلام الحكوميه بشان انتماء المقاتلين المتمركزين في المسجد حيث وصفتهم المعارضه بانهم مقاتلون تابعون للواء التوحيد في حين قالت وسائل الاعلام الرسميه بانهم تابعون لجبهه النصره. ادانت المعارضه وخصوصاً الائتلاف الوطني المعارض (الائتلاف الوطني لقوى الثوره والمعارضه السوريه) تدمير المئذنه، واصفهُ اياه بانه «عار الذي لا يمحى» و«جريمه ضد الحضاره الانسانيه».\n\nالطراز المعماري\nالابواب\nالباب الشمالي، يقع الى جوار المئذنه.\nالباب الغربي، ينفذ الى شارع المساميريه.\nالباب الشرقي، وينفذ الى سوق المناديل.\nالباب الجنوبي، ينفذ الى سوق النحاسين.\n\nفناء المسجد\nالفناء محاط بثلاثه اروقه الى جميع الجهات باستثناء الجهه الجنوبيه التي يكون فيها الحرم مباشره ملاصقاً لفناء المسجد\nتم بناء المسجد حول فناء كبير يربط مناطق مختلفه من المسجد، حيث ان هذه المناطق تقع خلف الممرات المزوده باعمده. ارضيه الفناء الحجريه والمعروفه بتناوب اللونين الابيض والاسود تشتهر بالتشكيلات الهندسيه المعقده والتي يشكلها تناوب اللونين الابيض والاسود.وتعود الى العصر العثماني وقد جددت مؤخراً. وتنفتح على الصحن عقود عشره من الجانبين وسته عشر عقداً في الشمال ومثلها في الجنوب ويشتهر الفناء بوجود نافورتي وضوء مسقوفتان. كما ويوجد مزوله في فناء المسجد.\n\nداخل المسجد\nالحرم و الذي يتكون من المصلى الى الجهه الجنوبيه من الفناء،  ويحوي هذا المصلى ضريح زكريا، ومنبر يعود للقرن الخامس عشر الميلادي، و المحراب المنحوت بشكل متقن. وعلى الرغم من ان الباب المركزي يحتوي على نقش ينسب بناء المصلى للسلطان العثماني مراد الثالث، الا ان المصلى كان قد بني على يد المماليك. يوجد في المصلى ثلاثه صحون (و الصحن هنا هو المسافه بين صفين من الاعمده) حيث يوجد 18 عموداً مربع قائم الزاويه في كل صف بالاضافه الى سقف نصفي برميلين متعامدين (حيث يتقاطع نصفي برميلين بشكل متعامد ليكونا السقف). كان المصلى في السابق ذو سقف مستقيم مع سطح القبه المركزيه، لكن خلال حكم المماليك اُستعيض عن هذا النمط بنظام قبب معقد (تقاطع نصفي برميلين بشكل متعامد) مع قناطر للاروقه بالاضافه الى قبه صغيره فوق الاروقه. اما مقام زكريا المزعوم فهو الى اليسار من المحراب وبطول الجدار الجنوبي.\n\nهناك ثلاثه قاعات اُخرى متاخمه للاروقه الثلاثه الاخرى. في القاعه الشماليه والشرقيه يوجد صحنان (و الصحن هنا هو المسافه بين صفين من الاعمده)، اما في القاعه الغربيه يوجد صحن واحد، وعلى الاغلب فان بناء القاعه الغربيه يعود الى العصر الحديث. اما القاعه الشرقيه فيعود تاريخها الى فتره حكم السلطان السلجوقي جلال الدوله ملك شاه (1072-1092) والقاعه الشماليه قد تم تجديدها في عهد السلطان المملوكي الظاهر سيف الدين برقوق (1382-1399)، ولكن الى حد كبير مازالت محافظهً على طابعها منذ القرن الحادي عشر الميلادي.\n\nالمئذنه\nليست المئذنه الاساسيه بل مئذنه جديده بنيت على مراحل منذ عهد الامير سابق بن محمود بن مرداس عام 472 هـ حتى عهد السلطان تتش بن الب ارسلان. والمئذنه مربعه المسقط يبلغ ارتفاعها نحو خمسه واربعين متراً (45 م)حتى شرفه المؤذن، اما طول ضلعها فيبلغ نحو 4,95 يرتفع جسم المئذنه من سطح قاعه الصلاه الشماليه ، كما وتتالف المئذنه من خمس مستويات متوجه بقمه لها شرفه. تبرز بعض العناصر المعماريه في الشرفه الموجوده في اعلى المئذنه مثل المقرنصات والحافه المتقدمه (Cornice)، تم بناء المئذنه الى حد كبير بالحجاره المصقوله. وزخرفت المئذنه بنقوش بارزه اكثر من اي مبنى يعود الى الحقبه الاسلاميه في حلب باستثناء المدرسه الشعيبييه.\n\nوفقاً لدائره المعارف الاسلاميه الاصدار الاول (E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam)فان المئذنه «فريده من نوعها في عموم العماره الاسلاميه».\n\nيصف عالم الاثار المستشرق الالماني ارنست هرتسفلد اسلوب عماره المئذنه بانه «نتاج حضاره البحر المتوسط».\nالكتابات التي تغطي اوجه المئذنه الاربعه تحمل عناصر العماره القوطيه.\n\nوصف ابن جبير للجامع\nان وصف ابن جبير في رحلته في حلب، لهذا الجامع الذي زاره سنه (580 هـ / 1183 م) يبين حاله المسجد قبل حريقه مع الاسواق سنه (564 هـ / 1168 م) وترميمه من نور الدين زنكي فيقول: \"انه من احسن الجوامع واجملها في كافه البلاد الاسلاميه، قد اطاف بصحنه الواسع بلاط كبير متسع مفتح كله ابواباً قصريه الحسن الى الصحن، عددها ينيف على الخمسين، والبلاط القبلي الحرم لا مقصوره فيه فجاء ظاهر الاتساع\". ثم يصف المحراب والمنبر وزخارفهما فيقول \"ما ارى في بلدٍ من البلاد منبراً على شكله وغرابه صنعته، واتصلت الصنعه الخشبيه منه الى المحراب فتجللت صفحاته كلها خشباً على تلك الصنعه الغريبه وارتفع كالتاج العظيم على المحراب، وعلا حتى اتصل بسمك السقف وقد قوّس اعلاه.. وهو مرصع كله بالعاج والابنوس. ان المنبر والمحراب الذي يصفه ابن جبير قد صنع في الوقت الذي امر فيه نور الدين زنكي بصنع منبر للمسجد الاقصى، نقله فيما بعد صلاح الدين بعد تحرير القدس سنه (583 هـ / 1187 م). ومن المؤكد ان صناع هذا المنبر وهم معالي واولاده المذكورون على منبر المسجد الاقصى الذي احرقه الصهاينه سنه 1969، اي انه يحمل نفس الشكل والزخارف في الجامع الاموي في مدينه حلب، ولقد قام هؤلاء بصنع محراب مدرسه الحلويه على غرار محراب مسجد حلب الذي وصفه ابن جبير. اذ ان ورشه اولاد معالي كانت تعمل في فناء الحلويه المجاور للجامع الكبير في حلب، على ان المنبر الحالي يعود الى ايام الملك الناصر محمد، والمحراب الحالي يعود الى عصر السلطان قلاوون، كما سنرى في وصف الجامع كما هو الان بشكل المتكامل وزخارفه وكل فخامته.\n\nاقسام الجامع الاموي\nالابواب\nالباب الشمالي، يقع الى جوار المئذنه.\nالباب الغربي، ينفذ الى شارع المساميريه.\nالباب الشرقي، وينفذ الى سوق المناديل.\nالباب الجنوبي، ينفذ الى سوق النحاسين.\nالصحن\nصحن واسع محاط باروقه ثلاثه، وحرم في الجهه القبليه والصحن مغطى ببلاط رخامي بلونين اصفر واسود وبتشكيلات هندسيه ما زالت تميز هذا الصحن، وتعود الى العصر العثماني وقد جددت مؤخراً. وتنفتح على الصحن عقود عشره من الجانبين وسته عشر عقداً في الشمال ومثلها في الجنوب، وفي وسط الصحن مطاهر حديثه مغطاه بقبه.\nالمئذنه\nوهي ليست المئذنه الاساسيه بل مئذنه جديده بنيت على مراحل منذ عهد الامير سابق بن محمود بن مرداس عام 472 هـ حتى عهد السلطان تتش بن الب ارسلان. والمئذنه مربعه المسقط يبلغ ارتفاعها نحو خمسه واربعين متراً (45 م)حتى شرفه المؤذن، اما طول ضلعها فيبلغ نحو 4,95 م\nبيت الصلاه\nالمنبر\nالمحاريب\n حجره الخطيب\nالحجره النبويه\nالحجازيه\nحجره خاصه بالنساء لاداء الصلاه، وسميت بالحجازيه لانها كانت منزل اهل الحجاز.\nالاروقه\n\nاهميه الجامع\nيذكر ان الجامع الاموي في حلب اكتسب شهره على مستوى العالم الاسلامي، نظراً لما يحتويه من زخرفه في فن العماره الاسلاميه وطراز عمراني قديم، اضافه الى كونه عملاً معمارياً اغتنى باضافات كثيره على مر العصور التاريخيه المتعاقبه، فلا يكاد عصر من العصور التاريخيه الاسلاميه الا وله شاهد في المسجد، اضافه الى ذلك فان القرارات المصيريه المهمه والاحداث التي ارتبطت بالجامع قد اكسبته اهميه خاصه. < بلدنا اون لاين. كما يحتوى الجامع على كنوز هامه، في الحرم سده من الخشب المزخرف بالوان مختلفه مع كتابه تشير الى عصر بانيها «قره سنقر كافل حلب» ويعود المنبر الى عصر الملك الناصر محمد، وصنعه محمد بن علي الموصلي، كما تشير الكتابه عليه، وهو من اجمل المنابر مزخرف بالرقش العربي الهندسي المركب من خشب الابنوس والمنزل بالعاج والنحاس البراق ويعود المحراب الى عصر السلطان قلاوون وقد تم باشراف كافل حلب قره سنقر سنه (681 هـ / 1281 م) وهو مبني بالحجر المشقف بزخارف هندسيه رائعه وكما هو الامر في الجامع الاموي في دمشق، فان ضريحاً يطلق عليه اسم الحضره النبويه، ويقال انه يحوي قبر النبي زكريا، موجود وفيه اشياء ثمينه محفوظه، منها مصاحف شريفه كتبها كبار الخطاطين السوريين والاتراك، وفيها قناديل قديمه مذهبه ومفضضه وقواعد شمعدان ولقد انشئ هذا الضريح منذ عام (907 هـ / 1500 م) ورمم مراراً، وكانت اخر الترميمات سنه (1030 هـ / 1620 م) وكسيت جدرانه الثلاثه بالواح الخزف القاشاني واقيم باب الضريح وفوقه قوس من الحجاره بلونين اسود وابيض، ان اروع ما يحويه هذا المسجد هو مئذنته المربعه المرتفعه خمسين متراً والتي جددت سنه (873 هـ / 1094 م) بديلاً عن ماذن امويه نعتقد انها كانت اربع ماذن في اركان المسجد، وكانت مربعه ولا شك على غرار جامع اميه الكبير بدمشق والجوامع الاخرى التي انشئت في عصر الخليفه الاموي الوليد بن عبد الملك.\n\nمعرض الصور\nانظر ايضًا\nقلعه حلب\nمدينه حلب القديمه\nالجامع الاموي (دمشق)\nعماره امويه\n\nالمراجع\n\n== الكتب والمؤلفات ==",

          "content": "Palmyra ( pal-MY-rə; Palmyrene Aramaic: 𐡶𐡣𐡬𐡥𐡴‎, romanized: Tadmor; Arabic: تَدْمُر‎, romanized: Tadmur) is an ancient city in central Syria. It is located in the eastern part of the Levant, and archaeological finds date back to the Neolithic period, and documents first mention the city in the early second millennium BCE. Palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of the Roman Empire in the first century CE.\nThe city grew wealthy from trade caravans; the Palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along the Silk Road and operated throughout the Roman Empire. Palmyra's wealth enabled the construction of monumental projects, such as the Great Colonnade, the Temple of Bel, and the distinctive tower tombs. Ethnically, the Palmyrenes combined elements of Amorites, Arameans, and Arabs. Socially structured around kinship and clans, Palmyra's inhabitants spoke Palmyrene Aramaic, a variety of Western Middle Aramaic, while using Koine Greek for commercial and diplomatic purposes. The Hellenistic period of West Asia influenced the culture of Palmyra, which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined different Mediterranean traditions. The city's inhabitants worshiped local Semitic, Mesopotamian, and Arab deities.\nBy the third century, Palmyra had become a prosperous regional center. It reached the apex of its power in the 260s, when the Palmyrene King Odaenathus defeated the Sasanian emperor Shapur I. The king was succeeded by queen regent Zenobia, who rebelled against Rome and established the Palmyrene Empire. In 273, Roman emperor Aurelian levelled the city, which was later restored by Diocletian at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to Christianity during the fourth century and to Islam in the centuries following the conquest by the seventh-century Rashidun Caliphate, after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by Arabic.\nBefore 273 CE, Palmyra enjoyed autonomy and was attached to the Roman province of Syria, having its political organization influenced by the Greek city-state model during the first two centuries CE. The city became a Roman colonia during the third century, leading to the incorporation of Roman governing institutions, before becoming a monarchy in 260. Following its razing in 273, Palmyra became a minor center under the Byzantines and later empires. Its destruction by the Timurids in 1400 reduced it to a small village. Under French Mandatory rule in 1932, the inhabitants were moved into the new village of Tadmur, and the ancient site became available for excavations. During the Syrian civil war in 2015, the Islamic State captured Palmyra and destroyed large parts of the ancient city, which was recaptured by the Syrian Army on 2 March 2017. It was then recaptured by the Syrian Free Army, after the fall of the Assad government in December 2024.\n\nEtymology\nRecords of the name \"Tadmor\" date from the early second millennium BC; 18th-century BC tablets from Mari written in cuneiform record the name as \"Ta-ad-mi-ir\", while Assyrian inscriptions of the 11th century BC record it as \"Ta-ad-mar\". Aramaic Palmyrene inscriptions themselves showed two variants of the name; TDMR (i.e., Tadmar) and TDMWR (i.e., Tadmor). The etymology of the name is unclear; the standard interpretation, supported by Albert Schultens, connects it to the Semitic word for \"date palm\", tamar (תמר‎), thus referring to the palm trees that surrounded the city.\nThe Greek name Παλμύρα (Latinized Palmyra) was first recorded by Pliny the Elder in the first century AD. It was used throughout the Greco-Roman world. It is generally believed that \"Palmyra\" derives from \"Tadmor\" and linguists have presented two possibilities; one view holds that Palmyra was an alteration of Tadmor. According to the suggestion by Schultens, \"Palmyra\" could have arisen as a corruption of \"Tadmor\", via an unattested form \"Talmura\", changed to \"Palmura\" by the influence of the Latin word palma (date \"palm\"), in reference to the city's palm trees, then the name reached its final form \"Palmyra\". The second view, supported by some philologists, such as Jean Starcky, holds that Palmyra is a translation of \"Tadmor\" (assuming that it meant palm), which had derived from the Greek word for palm, \"palame\".\nAn alternative suggestion connects the name to the Syriac tedmurtā (ܬܕܡܘܪܬܐ) \"miracle\", hence tedmurtā \"object of wonder\", from the root dmr \"to wonder\"; this possibility was mentioned favourably by Franz Altheim and Ruth Altheim-Stiehl (1973), but rejected by Jean Starcky (1960) and Michael Gawlikowski (1974). Michael Patrick O'Connor (1988) suggested that the names \"Palmyra\" and \"Tadmor\" originated in the Hurrian language. As evidence, he cited the inexplicability of alterations to the theorized roots of both names (represented in the addition of -d- to tamar and -ra- to palame). According to this theory, \"Tadmor\" derives from the Hurrian word tad (\"to love\") with the addition of the typical Hurrian mid vowel rising (mVr) formant mar. Similarly, according to this theory, \"Palmyra\" derives from the Hurrian word pal (\"to know\") using the same mVr formant (mar).\n\nRegion and city layout\nThe city of Palmyra lies 215 km (134 mi) northeast of the Syrian capital, Damascus; along with an expanded hinterland of several settlements, farms, and forts, the city forms part of the region known as Palmyrena or Palmyrene. The city is located in an oasis surrounded by palms (of which twenty varieties have been reported). Two mountain ranges overlook the city - the northern Palmyrene mountain belt from the north and the southern Palmyrene mountains from the southwest. In the south and the east Palmyra is exposed to the Syrian Desert. A small wadi, al-Qubur, crosses the area, flowing from the western hills past the city before disappearing in the eastern gardens of the oasis. South of the wadi is a spring, Efqa. Pliny the Elder described the town in the 70s AD as famous for its desert location, for the richness of its soil, and for the springs surrounding it, which made agriculture and herding possible.\n\nLayout\nPalmyra began as a small Neolithic settlement near the Efqa spring on the southern bank of Wadi al-Qubur. The much later Hellenistic settlement of Palmyra was also located near the Efqa spring on the southern bank of Wadi al-Qubur. It had its residences expanding to the wadi's northern bank during the first century. Although the city's walls at the time of Zenobia originally enclosed an extensive area on both banks of the wadi, the walls rebuilt during Aurelian's reign surrounded only the northern-bank section. Most of the city's monumental projects were built on the wadi's northern bank, among them is the Temple of Bel, on a tell which was the site of an earlier temple (known as the Hellenistic temple). However, excavation supports the theory that the tell was originally located on the southern bank, and the wadi was diverted south of the tell to incorporate the temple into Palmyra's late first and early second century urban organization on the north bank.\nAlso north of the wadi was the Great Colonnade, Palmyra's 1.1-kilometre-long (0.68 mi) main street, which extended from the Temple of Bel in the east, to the Funerary Temple no.86 in the city's western part. It had a monumental arch in its eastern section, and a tetrapylon stands in the center. The Baths of Diocletian were on the left side of the colonnade. Nearby were residences, the Temple of Baalshamin, and the Byzantine churches, which include \"Basilica IV\", Palmyra's largest church. The church is dated to the Justinian age, its columns are estimated to be 7 metres (23 ft) high, and its base measured 27.5 by 47.5 metres (90 by 156 ft).\nThe Temple of Nabu and the Roman theater were built on the colonnade's southern side. Behind the theater were a small senate building and the large agora, with the remains of a triclinium (banquet room) and the Tariff Court. A cross street at the western end of the colonnade leads to the Camp of Diocletian, built by Sosianus Hierocles (the Roman governor of Syria in the reign of Diocletian). Nearby are the Temple of Al-lāt and the Damascus Gate.\n\nDemographic history\nBronze and Iron Ages\nThe earliest known inhabitants were the Amorites in the early second millennium BC, and by the end of the millennium, Arameans were mentioned as inhabiting the area.\nArabs arrived in the city in the late first millennium BC.\n\nHellenistic to Byzantine periods\nZabdibel, who aided the Seleucids in the battle of Raphia (217 BC), was mentioned as the commander of \"the Arabs and neighbouring tribes to the number of ten thousands\"; Zabdibel and his men were not actually identified as Palmyrenes in the texts, but the name \"Zabdibel\" is a Palmyrene name leading to the conclusion that he hailed from Palmyra. The Arab newcomers were assimilated by the earlier inhabitants, used Palmyrene as a mother tongue, and formed a significant segment of the aristocracy.\nAt its height during the reign of Zenobia (around 270), Palmyra had more than 200,000 residents.\nThe classical city also had a Jewish community; inscriptions in Palmyrene from the Beit She'arim necropolis in Lower Galilee confirm the burial of Palmyrene Jews.\nDuring the Roman period, occasionally and rarely, members of the Palmyrene families took Greek names while ethnic Greeks were few; the majority of people with Greek names, who did not belong to one of the city's families, were freed slaves. The Palmyrenes seem to have disliked the Greeks, considered them foreigners, and restricted their settlement in the city.\n\nEarly Muslim to Late Ottoman periods\nDuring the Umayyad Caliphate, Palmyra was mainly inhabited by the Banu Kalb.\nBenjamin of Tudela recorded the existence of 2000 Jews in the city during the twelfth century.\nPalmyra declined after its destruction by Timur in 1400, and was a village of 6,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nEthnicity of classical Palmyra\nPalmyra's population was a mixture of the different peoples inhabiting the city, which is seen in Aramaic, Arabic and Amorite names of Palmyrene clans, but the ethnicity of Palmyra is a matter of debate.\nSome scholars, such as Andrew M. Smith II, consider ethnicity a concept related to modern nationalism, and prefer not to describe the Palmyrenes with ethnic designations they themselves did not know, concluding that there is a lack of evidence regarding what ethnicity the Palmyrenes perceived themselves. On the other hand, many scholars, such as Eivind Seland, contend that a distinctive Palmyrene ethnicity is apparent in the available contemporary evidence. The second century work De Munitionibus Castrorum mentioned the Palmyrenes as a natio, the Latin equivalent of the Greek ἔθνος (éthnos). Seland noted the epigraphic evidence left by the Palmyrenes outside the city.\nThe inscriptions reveal the existence of a real diaspora satisfying the three criteria set by the sociologist Rogers Brubaker. Palmyrene diaspora members always made clear their Palmyrene origin and used the Palmyrene language, and maintained their distinct religion even when the host society's religion was close to that of Palmyra. Seland concluded that in the case of Palmyra, the people perceived themselves different from their neighbours and a real Palmyrene ethnicity existed. Aside from the existence of a Palmyrene ethnicity, Aramean or Arab are the two main ethnic designations debated by historians; Javier Teixidor stated, \"Palmyra was an Aramaean city and it is a mistake to consider it as an Arab town\", while Yasamin Zahran criticized this statement and argued that the inhabitants considered themselves Arabs. In practice, according to several scholars such as Udo Hartmann and Michael Sommer, the citizenry of Palmyra were mainly the result of Arab and Aramaean tribes merging into a unity with a corresponding consciousness; they thought and acted as Palmyrenes.\n\nLanguage\nUntil the late third century, Palmyrenes spoke Palmyrene Aramaic and used the Palmyrene alphabet. The use of Latin was minimal, but Greek was used by wealthier members of society for commercial and diplomatic purposes, and it became the dominant language during the Byzantine era. There are several theories explaining the disappearance of the Palmyrene language shortly after the campaigns of Aurelian. The linguist Jean Cantineau assumed that Aurelian suppressed all aspects of Palmyrene culture, including the language, but the last Palmyrene inscription dates to 279/280, after the death of the Roman emperor in 275, thus refuting such a theory. Many scholars ascribe the disappearance of the language to a change in society resulting from the reorganization of the Eastern Roman frontier following the fall of Zenobia. The archaeologist Karol Juchniewicz ascribed it to a change in the ethnic composition of the city, resulting from the influx of people who did not speak Aramaic, probably a Roman legion. Hartmann suggested that it was a Palmyrene initiative by nobles allied to Rome attempting to express their loyalty to the emperor; Hartmann noted that Palmyrene disappeared in the written form, and that this does not mean its extinction as spoken language. After the Arab conquest, Greek was replaced by Arabic, from which, although the city was surrounded by Bedouins, a Palmyrene dialect evolved.\n\nSocial organization\nClassical Palmyra was a tribal community, but due to the lack of sources, an understanding of the nature of Palmyrene tribal structure is not possible. Thirty clans have been documented; five of which were identified as tribes (Phylai Koine Greek: Φυλαί, pl. of Phyle Φυλή) comprising several sub-clans. By the time of Nero, Palmyra had four tribes, each residing in an area of the city bearing its name. Three of the tribes were the Komare, Mattabol and Ma'zin; the fourth tribe is uncertain, but was probably the Mita. In time, the four tribes became highly civic and tribal lines blurred; by the second century clan identity lost its importance, and it disappeared during the third century. Even the four tribes ceased to be important by the third century as only one inscription mentions a tribe after the year 212; instead, aristocrats played the decisive role in the city's social organization.\nWomen seem to have been active in Palmyra's social and public life. They commissioned inscriptions, buildings or tombs, and in certain cases, held administrative offices. Offerings to gods in the names of women are documented.\nThe last Palmyrene inscription of 279/280 refers to the honouring of a citizen by the Maththabolians, which indicates that the tribal system still carried weight after the fall of Zenobia. A noticeable change is the lack of development of aristocratic residences, and no important public buildings were constructed by locals, indicating that the elite diminished following the campaign of Aurelian. The social change and the reduction of the aristocratic elite is hard to explain. It could be a result of the aristocracy suffering many casualties in the war against Rome, or fleeing to the countryside.\nAccording to historian Emanuele Intagliata, the change can be ascribed to the Roman reorganization following Zenobia's fall, as Palmyra ceased to be a rich caravan city and became a frontier fortress, leading the inhabitants to focus on satisfying the needs of a garrison instead of providing the empire with luxurious oriental items. Such a change in functions would have made the city less attractive for an aristocratic elite.\nPalmyra benefited from Umayyad rule, since its role as a frontier city ended and the East-West trade route was restored, leading to the re-emergence of a merchant class. Palmyra's loyalty to the Umayyads led to an aggressive military retaliation from their successors, the Abbasid Caliphate, and the city diminished in size, losing its merchant class.\nFollowing its destruction by Timur, Palmyra maintained the life of a small settlement until its relocation in 1932.\n\nCulture\nThe scarce artifacts found in the city dating to the Bronze Age reveal that, culturally, Palmyra was most affiliated with western Syria. Classical Palmyra had a distinctive culture, based on a local Semitic tradition, and influenced by Greece and Rome. To appear better integrated into the Roman Empire, some Palmyrenes adopted Greco-Roman names, either alone or in addition to a second native name. The extent of Greek influence on Palmyra's culture is debated. Scholars interpreted the Palmyrenes' Greek practices differently; many see those characters as a superficial layer over a local essence. Palmyra's senate was an example; although Palmyrene texts written in Greek described it as a \"boule\" (a Greek institution), the senate was a gathering of non-elected tribal elders (a Near-Eastern assembly tradition). Others view Palmyra's culture as a fusion of local and Greco-Roman traditions.\n\nThe culture of Persia influenced Palmyrene military tactics, dress and court ceremonies. Palmyra had no large libraries or publishing facilities, and it lacked an intellectual movement characteristic of other Eastern cities such as Edessa or Antioch. Although Zenobia opened her court to academics, the only notable scholar documented was Cassius Longinus.\nPalmyra had a large agora. However, unlike the Greek Agoras (public gathering places shared with public buildings), Palmyra's agora resembled an Eastern caravanserai more than a hub of public life. The Palmyrenes buried their dead in elaborate family mausoleums, most with interior walls forming rows of burial chambers (loculi) in which the dead, lying at full length, were placed. A relief of the person interred formed part of the wall's decoration, acting as a headstone. Sarcophagi appeared in the late second century and were used in some of the tombs. Many burial monuments contained mummies embalmed in a method similar to that used in Ancient Egypt.\n\nArt and architecture\nAlthough Palmyrene art was related to that of Greece, it had a distinctive style unique to the middle-Euphrates region. Palmyrene art is well represented by the bust reliefs which seal the openings of its burial chambers. The reliefs emphasized clothing, jewelry and a frontal representation of the person depicted, characteristics which can be seen as a forerunner of Byzantine art. According to Michael Rostovtzeff, Palmyra's art was influenced by Parthian art. However, the origin of frontality that characterized Palmyrene and Parthian arts is a controversial issue; while Parthian origin has been suggested (by Daniel Schlumberger), Michael Avi-Yonah contends that it was a local Syrian tradition that influenced Parthian art. Little painting, and none of the bronze statues of prominent citizens (which stood on brackets on the main columns of the Great Colonnade), have survived. A damaged frieze and other sculptures from the Temple of Bel, many removed to museums in Syria and abroad, suggest the city's public monumental sculpture.\nMany surviving funerary busts reached Western museums during the 19th century. Palmyra provided the most convenient Eastern examples bolstering an art-history controversy at the turn of the 20th century: to what extent Eastern influence on Roman art replaced idealized classicism with frontal, hieratic and simplified figures (as believed by Josef Strzygowski and others). This transition is seen as a response to cultural changes in the Western Roman Empire, rather than artistic influence from the East. Palmyrene bust reliefs, unlike Roman sculptures, are rudimentary portraits; although many reflect high quality individuality, the majority vary little across figures of similar age and gender.\nLike its art, Palmyra's architecture was influenced by the Greco-Roman style, while preserving local elements (best seen in the Temple of Bel). Enclosed by a massive wall flanked with traditional Roman columns, Bel's sanctuary plan was primarily Semitic. Similar to the Second Temple, the sanctuary consisted of a large courtyard with the deity's main shrine off-center against its entrance (a plan preserving elements of the temples of Ebla and Ugarit).\n\nSite\nCemeteries\nWest of the ancient walls, the Palmyrenes built a number of large-scale funerary monuments which now form the Valley of Tombs, a one-kilometre-long (0.62 mi) necropolis. The more than 50 monuments were primarily tower-shaped and up to four stories high. Towers were replaced by funerary temples in the first half of the second century AD, as the most recent tower is dated to AD 128. The city had other cemeteries in the north, southwest and southeast, where the tombs are primarily hypogea (underground).\n\nNotable structures\nPublic buildings\nThe senate building is largely ruined. It is a small building that consists of a peristyle courtyard and a chamber that has an apse at one end and rows of seats around it.\nMuch of the Baths of Diocletian are ruined and do not survive above the level of the foundations. The complex's entrance is marked by four massive Egyptian granite columns each 1.3 metres (4 ft 3 in) in diameter, 12.5 metres (41 ft) high and weigh 20 tonnes. Inside, the outline of a bathing pool surrounded by a colonnade of Corinthian columns is still visible in addition to an octagonal room that served as a dressing room containing a drain in its center. Sossianus Hierocles, a governor under Emperor Diocletian, claimed to have built the baths, but the building was probably erected in the late second century and Sossianus Hierocles renovated it.\nThe Agora of Palmyra is part of a complex that also includes the tariff court and the triclinium, built in the second half of the first century AD. The agora is a massive 71-by-84-metre (233 by 276 ft) structure with 11 entrances. Inside the agora, 200 columnar bases that used to hold statues of prominent citizens were found. The inscriptions on the bases allowed an understanding of the order by which the statues were grouped; the eastern side was reserved for senators, the northern side for Palmyrene officials, the western side for soldiers and the southern side for caravan chiefs.\nThe Tariff Court is a large rectangular enclosure south of the agora and sharing its northern wall with it. Originally, the entrance of the court was a massive vestibule in its southwestern wall. However, the entrance was blocked by the construction of a defensive wall and the court was entered through three doors from the Agora. The court gained its name by containing a 5-metre (16 ft) stone slab that had the Palmyrene tax law inscribed on it.\nThe Triclinium of the Agora is at the northwestern corner of the Agora and can host up to 40 people. It is a small 12-by-15-metre (39 by 49 ft) hall decorated with Greek key motifs that run in a continuous line halfway up the wall. The building was probably used by the rulers of the city; the French general director of antiquities in Syria, Henri Seyrig, proposed that it was a small temple before being turned into a triclinium or banqueting hall.\n\nTemples\nThe Temple of Bel was dedicated in AD 32; it consisted of a large precinct lined by porticos; it had a rectangular shape and was oriented north-south. The exterior wall was 205-metre (673 ft) long with a propylaea, and the cella stood on a podium in the middle of the enclosure.\nThe Temple of Baalshamin dates to the late 2nd century BC in its earliest phases; its altar was built in AD 115, and it was substantially rebuilt in AD 131. It consisted of a central cella and two colonnaded courtyards north and south of the central structure. A vestibule consisting of six columns preceded the cella which had its side walls decorated with pilasters in Corinthian order.\nThe Temple of Nabu is largely ruined. The temple was Eastern in its plan; the outer enclosure's propylaea led to a 20-by-9-metre (66 by 30 ft) podium through a portico of which the bases of the columns survives. The peristyle cella opened onto an outdoor altar.\n\nThe Temple of Al-Lat is largely ruined with only a podium, a few columns and the door frame remaining. Inside the compound, a giant lion relief (Lion of Al-lāt) was excavated and in its original form, was a relief protruding from the temple compound's wall.\nThe ruined Temple of Baal-hamon was located on the top of Jabal al-Muntar hill which oversees the spring of Efqa. Constructed in AD 89, it consisted of a cella and a vestibule with two columns. The temple had a defensive tower attached to it; a mosaic depicting the sanctuary was excavated and it revealed that both the cella and the vestibule were decorated with merlons.\n\nOther buildings\nThe Arch of Triumph was one of Palmyra's monuments that was destroyed by ISIS in 2015 with the use of dynamite.\n\nThe Great Colonnade was Palmyra's 1.1-kilometre-long (0.68 mi) main street; most of the columns date to the second century AD and each is 9.50 metres (31.2 ft) high.\nThe Funerary Temple no. 86 (also known as the House Tomb) is located at the western end of the Great Colonnade. It was built in the third century AD and has a portico of six columns and vine patterns carvings. Inside the chamber, steps leads down to a vault crypt. The shrine might have been connected to the royal family as it is the only tomb inside the city's walls.\nThe Tetrapylon was erected during the renovations of Diocletian at the end of the third century. It is a square platform and each corner contains a grouping of four columns. Each column group supports a 150-ton cornice and contains a pedestal in its center that originally carried a statue. Out of sixteen columns, only one is original while the rest are from reconstruction work by the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities in 1963, using concrete. The original columns were brought from Egypt and carved out of pink granite.\nThe Walls of Palmyra started in the first century as a protective wall containing gaps where the surrounding mountains formed natural barriers; it encompassed the residential areas, the gardens and the oasis. After 273, Aurelian erected the rampart known as the wall of Diocletian; it enclosed about 80 hectares, a much smaller area than the original pre-273 city.\n\nDestruction by IS\nAccording to eyewitnesses, on 23 May 2015 Islamic State militants destroyed the Lion of Al-lāt and other statues; this came days after the militants had gathered the citizens and promised not to destroy the city's monuments. IS destroyed the Temple of Baalshamin on 23 August 2015. On 30 August 2015, IS destroyed the cella of the Temple of Bel. On 31 August 2015, the United Nations confirmed the temple was destroyed; the temple's exterior walls and entrance arch remain.\nIt became known on 4 September 2015 that IS had destroyed three of the best preserved tower tombs including the Tower of Elahbel. On 5 October 2015, news media reported that IS was destroying buildings with no religious meaning, including the monumental arch. On 20 January 2017, news emerged that the militants had destroyed the tetrapylon and part of the theater. Following the March 2017 capture of Palmyra by the Syrian Army, Maamoun Abdulkarim, director of antiquities and museums at the Syrian Ministry of Culture, stated that the damage to ancient monuments may be lesser than earlier believed and preliminary pictures showed almost no further damage than what was already known. Antiquities official Wael Hafyan stated that the Tetrapylon was badly damaged while the damage to the facade of the Roman theatre was less serious.\n\nRestoration\nIn response to the destruction, on 21 October 2015, Creative Commons started the New Palmyra project, an online repository of three-dimensional models representing the city's monuments; the models were generated from images gathered, and released into the public domain, by the Syrian internet advocate Bassel Khartabil between 2005 and 2012. Minor restorations took place; two Palmyrene funerary busts, damaged and defaced by IS, were sent off to Rome where they were restored and sent back to Syria. The restoration of the Lion of Al-lāt took two months and the statue was displayed on 1 October 2017; it will remain in the National Museum of Damascus.\nRegarding the restoration, the discoverer of Ebla, Paolo Matthiae, stated that: \"The archaeological site of Palmyra is a vast field of ruins and only 20–30% of it is seriously damaged. Unfortunately these included important parts, such as the Temple of Bel, while the Arch of Triumph can be rebuilt.\" He added: \"In any case, by using both traditional methods and advanced technologies, it might be possible to restore 98% of the site\".\nIn February 2022, following acts of restoration and rehabilitation the Afqa spring site was reopened. In October 2022, the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums and the Institute for the History of Material Culture of Russian Academy of Sciences signed an agreement to start the second and third phase of the project for restoring Arch of Triumph. In February 2023, Directorate General of Antiquities and Museums has finalized the study required for restoring Palmyra National Museum which was subjected to damage by ISIS terrorists in 2015. By May 2023, the first phase of the reconstruction and rehabilitation project of the Arch of Triumph was completed. In July 2023, the comprehensive restoration of Roman Theatre started.\n\nHistory\nThe area has a rich history of human habitation, with evidence of Paleolithic settlements. Habitation in the area of Tell ez-Zor, dates as far back as the Prepottery Neolithic A period, with a three-unit architectural complex dating to the Prepottery Neolithic B period. In the Efqa Spring site, not far from the Tell, a Neolithic settlement existed, with stone tools dated to 7500 BC. Archaeological sounding in the tell beneath the Temple of Bel uncovered a mud-brick structure built around 2500 BC, followed by structures built during the Middle Bronze Age and Iron Age.\n\nBronze and Iron Ages\nThe city entered the historical record during the Bronze Age around 2000 BC, when Puzur-Ishtar the Tadmorean (Palmyrene) agreed to a contract at an Assyrian trading colony in Kultepe. It was mentioned next in the Mari tablets as a stop for trade caravans and nomadic tribes, such as the Suteans, and was conquered along with its region by Yahdun-Lim of Mari. King Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria passed through the area on his way to the Mediterranean at the beginning of the 18th century BC; by then, Palmyra was the easternmost point of the kingdom of Qatna, and it was attacked by the Suteans who paralyzed the traffic along the trade routes. Palmyra was mentioned in a 13th-century BC tablet discovered at Emar, which recorded the names of two \"Tadmorean\" witnesses. At the beginning of the 11th century BC, King Tiglath-Pileser I of Assyria recorded his defeat of the \"Arameans\" of \"Tadmar\"; according to the king, Palmyra was part of the land of Amurru. The city became the eastern border of Aram-Damascus which was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 732 BC.\nThe Hebrew Bible (Second Book of Chronicles 8:4) records a city by the name \"Tadmor\" as a desert city built (or fortified) by King Solomon of Israel; Flavius Josephus mentions the Greek name \"Palmyra\", attributing its founding to Solomon in Book VIII of his Antiquities of the Jews. Later Arabic traditions attribute the city's founding to Solomon's Jinn. The association of Palmyra with Solomon is a conflation of \"Tadmor\" and a city built by Solomon in Judea and known as \"Tamar\" in the Books of Kings (1 Kings 9:18). The biblical description of \"Tadmor\" and its buildings does not fit archaeological findings in Palmyra, which was a small settlement during Solomon's reign in the 10th century BC. The Elephantine Jews, a diaspora community established between 650 and 550 BC in Egypt, might have come from Palmyra. Papyrus Amherst 63 indicates that the ancestors of the Elephantine Jews were Samarians. The historian Karel van der Toorn suggested that these ancestors took refuge in Judea after the destruction of their kingdom by Sargon II of Assyria in 721 BC, then had to leave Judea after Sennacherib devastated the land in 701 BC and headed to Palmyra. This scenario can explain the usage of Aramaic by the Elephantine Jews, and Papyrus Amherst 63, while not mentioning Palmyra, refers to a \"fortress of palms\" that is located near a spring on a trade route in the fringes of the desert, making Palmyra a plausible candidate.\n\nHellenistic and Roman periods\nDuring the Hellenistic period under the Seleucids (between 312 and 64 BC), Palmyra became a prosperous settlement owing allegiance to the Seleucid king. Evidence for Palmyra's urbanisation in the Hellenistic period is rare; an important piece is the Laghman II inscription found in Laghman, modern Afghanistan, and commissioned by the Indian emperor Ashoka c. 250 BC. The reading is contested, but according to semitologist André Dupont-Sommer, the inscription records the distance to \"Tdmr\" (Palmyra). In 217 BC, a Palmyrene force led by Zabdibel joined the army of King Antiochus III in the Battle of Raphia which ended in a Seleucid defeat by Ptolemaic Egypt. In the middle of the Hellenistic era, Palmyra, formerly south of the al-Qubur wadi, began to expand beyond its northern bank. By the late second century BC, the tower tombs in the Palmyrene Valley of Tombs and the city temples (most notably, the temples of Baalshamin, Al-lāt and the Hellenistic temple) began to be built. A fragmentary inscription in Greek from the Temple of Bel's foundations mentions a king titled Epiphanes, a title used by the Seleucid kings.\nIn 64 BC, the Roman Republic conquered the Seleucid kingdom, and the Roman general Pompey established the province of Syria. Palmyra was left independent, trading with Rome and Parthia but belonging to neither. The earliest known inscription in Palmyrene is dated to around 44 BC; Palmyra was still a minor sheikhdom, offering water to caravans which occasionally took the desert route on which it was located. However, according to Appian, Palmyra was wealthy enough for Mark Antony to send a force to conquer it in 41 BC. The Palmyrenes evacuated to Parthian lands beyond the eastern bank of the Euphrates, which they prepared to defend.\n\nAutonomous Palmyrene region\nPalmyra became part of the Roman Empire when it was conquered and paid tribute early in the reign of Tiberius, around 14 AD. The Romans included Palmyra in the province of Syria, and defined the region's boundaries. Pliny the Elder asserted that both the Palmyrene and Emesene regions were contiguous; a marker at the Palmyrene's southwestern border was found in 1936 by Daniel Schlumberger at Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi, dating from the reign of Hadrian or one of his successors, which marked the boundary between the two regions. This boundary probably ran northwards to Khirbet al-Bilaas on Jabal al-Bilas where another marker, laid by the Roman governor Silanus, has been found, 75 kilometres (47 mi) northwest of Palmyra, probably marking a boundary with the territory of Epiphania. Meanwhile, Palmyra's eastern border extended to the Euphrates valley. This region included numerous villages subordinate to the center, including large settlements such as al-Qaryatayn. The Roman imperial period brought great prosperity to the city, which enjoyed a privileged status under the empire—retaining much of its internal autonomy, being ruled by a council, and incorporating many Greek city-state (polis) institutions into its government.\nThe earliest Palmyrene text attesting a Roman presence in the city dates to 18 AD, when the Roman general Germanicus tried to develop a friendly relationship with Parthia; he sent the Palmyrene Alexandros to Mesene, a Parthian vassal kingdom. This was followed by the arrival of the Roman legion Legio X Fretensis the following year. Roman authority was minimal during the first century AD, although tax collectors were resident, and a road connecting Palmyra and Sura was built in AD 75. The Romans used Palmyrene soldiers, but (unlike typical Roman cities) no local magistrates or prefects are recorded in the city. Palmyra saw intensive construction during the first century, including the city's first walled fortifications, and the Temple of Bel (completed and dedicated in 32 AD). During the first century Palmyra developed from a minor desert caravan station into a leading trading center, with Palmyrene merchants establishing colonies in surrounding trade centers.\nPalmyrene trade reached its acme during the second century, aided by two factors; the first was a trade route built by Palmyrenes, and protected by garrisons at major locations, including a garrison in Dura-Europos manned in 117 AD. The second was the Roman conquest of the Nabataean capital Petra in 106, shifting control over southern trade routes of the Arabian Peninsula from the Nabataeans to Palmyra. In 129 Palmyra was visited by Hadrian, who named it \"Hadriane Palmyra\" and made it a free city. Hadrian promoted Hellenism throughout the empire, and Palmyra's urban expansion was modeled on that of Greece. This led to new projects, including the theatre, the colonnade and the Temple of Nabu. Roman garrisons are first attested in Palmyra in 167, when the cavalry Ala I Thracum Herculiana was moved to the city. By the end of the second century, urban development diminished after the city's building projects peaked.\nIn the 190s, Palmyra was assigned to the province of Phoenice, newly created by the Severan dynasty. Toward the end of the second century, Palmyra began a steady transition from a traditional Greek city-state to a monarchy due to the increasing militarization of the city and the deteriorating economic situation; the Severan ascension to the imperial throne in Rome played a major role in Palmyra's transition:\n\nThe Severan-led Roman–Parthian War, from 194 to 217, influenced regional security and affected the city's trade. Bandits began attacking caravans by 199, leading Palmyra to strengthen its military presence.\nThe new dynasty favored the city, stationing the Cohors I Flavia Chalcidenorum garrison there by 206. Caracalla made Palmyra a colonia between 213 and 216, replacing many Greek institutions with Roman constitutional ones. Severus Alexander, emperor from 222 to 235, visited Palmyra in 229.\n\nPalmyrene kingdom\nThe rise of the Sasanian Empire in Persia considerably damaged Palmyrene trade. The Sasanians disbanded Palmyrene colonies in their lands, and began a war against the Roman Empire. In an inscription dated to 252 Odaenathus appears bearing the title of exarchos (lord) of Palmyra. The weakness of the Roman Empire and the constant Persian danger were probably the reasons behind the Palmyrene council's decision to elect a lord for the city in order for him to lead a strengthened army. Odaenathus approached Shapur I of Persia to request him to guarantee Palmyrene interests in Persia, but was rebuffed. In 260 the Emperor Valerian fought Shapur at the Battle of Edessa, but was defeated and captured. One of Valerian's officers, Macrianus Major, his sons Quietus and Macrianus, and the prefect Balista rebelled against Valerian's son Gallienus, usurping imperial power in Syria.\n\nPersian wars\nOdaenathus formed an army of Palmyrenes and Syrian peasants against Shapur. According to the Augustan History, Odaenathus declared himself king prior to the battle. The Palmyrene leader won a decisive victory near the banks of the Euphrates later in 260 forcing the Persians to retreat. In 261 Odaenathus marched against the remaining usurpers in Syria, defeating and killing Quietus and Balista. As a reward, he received the title Imperator Totius Orientis (\"Governor of the East\") from Gallienus, and ruled Syria, Mesopotamia, Arabia and Anatolia's eastern regions as the imperial representative. Palmyra itself remained officially part of the empire but Palmyrene inscriptions started to describe it as a \"metrocolonia\", indicating that the city's status was higher than normal Roman colonias. In practice, Palmyra shifted from a provincial city to a de facto allied kingdom.\nIn 262 Odaenathus launched a new campaign against Shapur, reclaiming the rest of Roman Mesopotamia (most importantly, the cities of Nisibis and Carrhae), sacking the Jewish city of Nehardea, and besieging the Persian capital Ctesiphon. Following his victory, the Palmyrene monarch assumed the title King of Kings. Later, Odaenathus crowned his son Hairan I as co-King of Kings near Antioch in 263. Although he did not take the Persian capital, Odaenathus drove the Persians out of all Roman lands conquered since the beginning of Shapur's wars in 252. In a second campaign that took place in 266, the Palmyrene king reached Ctesiphon again; however, he had to leave the siege and move north, accompanied by Hairan I, to repel Gothic attacks on Asia Minor. The king and his son were assassinated during their return in 267; according to the Augustan History and Joannes Zonaras, Odaenathus was killed by a cousin (Zonaras says nephew) named in the History as Maeonius. The Augustan History also says that Maeonius was proclaimed emperor for a brief period before being killed by the soldiers. However, no inscriptions or other evidence exist for Maeonius' reign.\n\nOdaenathus was succeeded by his son; the ten-year-old Vaballathus. Zenobia, the mother of the new king, was the de facto ruler and Vaballathus remained in her shadow while she consolidated her power. Gallienus dispatched his prefect Heraclian to command military operations against the Persians, but he was marginalized by Zenobia and returned to the West. The queen was careful not to provoke Rome, claiming for herself and her son the titles held by her husband while guaranteeing the safety of the borders with Persia and pacifying the Tanukhids in Hauran. To protect the borders with Persia, Zenobia fortified different settlements on the Euphrates including the citadels of Halabiye and Zalabiye. Circumstantial evidence exist for confrontations with the Sasanians; probably in 269 Vaballathus took the title Persicus Maximus (\"The great victor in Persia\") and the title might be linked with an unrecorded battle against a Persian army trying to regain control of Northern Mesopotamia.\n\nPalmyrene empire\nZenobia began her military career in the spring of 270, during the reign of Claudius Gothicus. Under the pretext of attacking the Tanukhids, she conquered Roman Arabia. This was followed in October by an invasion of Egypt, ending with a Palmyrene victory and Zenobia's proclamation as queen of Egypt. Palmyra invaded Anatolia the following year, reaching Ankara and the pinnacle of its expansion. The conquests were made behind a mask of subordination to Rome. Zenobia issued coins in the name of Claudius' successor Aurelian, with Vaballathus depicted as king; since Aurelian was occupied with repelling insurgencies in Europe, he tolerated the Palmyrene coinage and encroachments. In late 271, Vaballathus and his mother assumed the titles of Augustus (emperor) and Augusta.\nThe following year, Aurelian crossed the Bosphorus and advanced quickly through Anatolia. According to one account, Roman general Marcus Aurelius Probus regained Egypt from Palmyra; Aurelian entered Issus and headed to Antioch, where he defeated Zenobia in the Battle of Immae. Zenobia was defeated again at the Battle of Emesa, taking refuge in Homs before quickly returning to her capital. When the Romans besieged Palmyra, Zenobia refused their order to surrender in person to the emperor. She escaped east to ask the Persians for help, but was captured by the Romans; the city capitulated soon afterwards.\n\nLater Roman and Byzantine periods\nAurelian spared the city and stationed a garrison of 600 archers, led by Sandarion, as a peacekeeping force. In 273 Palmyra rebelled under the leadership of Septimius Apsaios, declaring Antiochus (a relative of Zenobia) as Augustus. Aurelian marched against Palmyra, razing it to the ground and seizing the most valuable monuments to decorate his Temple of Sol. Palmyrene buildings were smashed, residents massacred and the Temple of Bel pillaged.\nPalmyra was significantly reduced and it largely disappeared from historical records of that period. After its sacking, Aurelian repaired the Temple of Bel, and the Legio I Illyricorum was stationed in the city. Shortly before 303 the Camp of Diocletian, a castrum in the western part of the city, was built. The 4-hectare (9.9-acre) camp was a base for the Legio I Illyricorum, which guarded the trade routes around the city. Though some of the city would not be rebuilt, Palmyra would become a major stronghold and fortress in the East. Thanks in part to this, in the following years Palmyra began to regain importance, becoming a Christian city in the decades following its destruction by Aurelian. In late 527, Justinian I further strengthened the city, ordering the restoration of Palmyra's churches and public buildings to protect the empire against raids by Lakhmid king Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man.\n\nArab caliphates\nPalmyra was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate after its 634 capture by the Muslim general Khalid ibn al-Walid, who took the city on his way to Damascus; an 18-day march by his army through the Syrian Desert from Mesopotamia. By then Palmyra was limited to the Diocletian camp. After the conquest, the city became part of Homs Province.\n\nUmayyad and early Abbasid periods\nPalmyra prospered as part of the Umayyad Caliphate, and its population grew. It was a key stop on the East-West trade route, with a large souq (market), built by the Umayyads, who also commissioned part of the Temple of Bel as a mosque. During this period, Palmyra was a stronghold of the Banu Kalb tribe, which began to take abode in and around the city after the conquest. After being defeated by Marwan II during a civil war in the caliphate, Umayyad contender Sulayman ibn Hisham fled to the Banu Kalb in Palmyra, but eventually pledged allegiance to Marwan in 744; Palmyra continued to oppose Marwan until the surrender of the Banu Kalb chief al-Asbagh ibn Dhu'ala in 745. That year, Marwan ordered the city's walls demolished.\nIn 750 a revolt, led by Majza'a ibn al-Kawthar and Umayyad pretender Abu Muhammad al-Sufyani, against the new Abbasid Caliphate swept across Syria; the tribes in Palmyra supported the rebels. After his defeat Abu Muhammad took refuge in the city, which withstood an Abbasid assault long enough to allow him to escape.\n\nDecentralization\nAbbasid power dwindled during the 10th century, when the empire disintegrated and was divided among a number of vassals. Most of the new rulers acknowledged the caliph as their nominal sovereign, a situation which continued until the Mongol destruction of the Abbasid Caliphate in 1258.\nThe population of the city started to decrease in the ninth century and the process continued in the tenth century. In 955 Sayf al-Dawla, the Hamdanid prince of Aleppo, defeated the nomads near the city, and built a kasbah (fortress) in response to campaigns by the Byzantine emperors Nikephoros II Phokas and John I Tzimiskes. With the advent of Fatimid rule in the late 10th century, Palmyra remained a stronghold of the Kalb and taxes on the oasis' crops was a major source of the tribe's income. Toward the end of the century, the Kalb around Palmyra migrated from the area. Earthquakes devastated Palmyra in 1068 and 1089. In the 1070s Syria was conquered by the Seljuk Empire, and in 1082, the district of Homs came under the control of the Arab lord Khalaf ibn Mula'ib. The latter was a brigand and was removed and imprisoned in 1090 by the Seljuq sultan Malik-Shah I. Khalaf's lands were given to Malik-Shah's brother, Tutush I, who gained his independence after his brother's 1092 death and established a cadet branch of the Seljuk dynasty in Syria.\n\nBy the twelfth century, the population moved into the courtyard of the Temple of Bel which was fortified; Palmyra was then ruled by Toghtekin, the Burid atabeg of Damascus, who appointed his nephew governor. Toghtekin's nephew was killed by rebels, and the atabeg retook the city in 1126. Palmyra was given to Toghtekin's grandson, Shihab-ud-din Mahmud, who was replaced by governor Yusuf ibn Firuz when Shihab-ud-din Mahmud returned to Damascus after his father Taj al-Muluk Buri succeeded Toghtekin. The Burids transformed the Temple of Bel into a citadel in 1132, fortifying the city, and transferring it to the Bin Qaraja family three years later in exchange for Homs.\nDuring the mid-twelfth century, Palmyra was ruled by the Zengid king Nur ad-Din Mahmud. It became part of the district of Homs, which was given as a fiefdom to the Ayyubid general Shirkuh in 1168 and confiscated after his death in 1169. Homs region was conquered by the Ayyubid sultanate in 1174; the following year, Saladin gave Homs (including Palmyra) to his cousin Nasir al-Din Muhammad as a fiefdom. After Saladin's death, the Ayyubid realm was divided and Palmyra was given to Nasir al-Din Muhammad's son Al-Mujahid Shirkuh II (who built the castle of Palmyra known as Fakhr-al-Din al-Maani Castle around 1230). Five years earlier, Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi described Palmyra's residents as living in \"a castle surrounded by a stone wall\".\n\nMamluk period\nPalmyra was used as a refuge by Shirkuh II's grandson, al-Ashraf Musa, who allied himself with the Mongol king Hulagu Khan and fled after the Mongol defeat in the 1260 Battle of Ain Jalut against the Mamluks. Al-Ashraf Musa asked the Mamluk sultan Qutuz for pardon and was accepted as a vassal. Al-Ashraf Musa died in 1263 without an heir, bringing the Homs district under direct Mamluk rule.\n\nAl Fadl principality\nThe Al Fadl clan (a branch of the Tayy tribe) were loyal to the Mamluks, and in 1281, Prince Issa bin Muhanna of the Al Fadl was appointed lord of Palmyra by sultan Qalawun. Issa was succeeded in 1284 by his son Muhanna bin Issa who was imprisoned by sultan al-Ashraf Khalil in 1293, and restored two years later by sultan al-Adil Kitbugha. Muhanna declared his loyalty to Öljaitü of the Ilkhanate in 1312 and was dismissed and replaced with his brother Fadl by sultan an-Nasir Muhammad. Although Muhanna was forgiven by an-Nasir and restored in 1317, he and his tribe were expelled in 1320 for his continued relations with the Ilkhanate, and he was replaced by tribal chief Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr.\nMuhanna was forgiven and restored by an-Nasir in 1330; he remained loyal to the sultan until his death in 1335, when he was succeeded by his son. Contemporary historian Ibn Fadlallah al-Omari described the city as having \"vast gardens, flourishing trades and bizarre monuments\". The Al Fadl clan protected the trade routes and villages from Bedouin raids, raiding other cities and fighting among themselves. The Mamluks intervened militarily several times, dismissing, imprisoning or expelling its leaders. In 1400 Palmyra was attacked by Timur; the Fadl prince Nu'air escaped the battle and later fought Jakam, the sultan of Aleppo. Nu'air was captured, taken to Aleppo and executed in 1406; this, according to Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, ended the Al Fadl clan's power.\n\nOttoman era\nWhile most of Syria came under Ottoman rule in 1516, Palmyra (Tadmur) does not appear to have been incorporated into the Empire before the conquest of Iraq in 1534–1535. It first appears as the centre of an administrative district (sanjak) around 1560. The region was important to the Ottomans above all for its salt deposits. In 1568, the governor of the sancak restored the medieval citadel. After 1568 the Ottomans appointed the Lebanese emir Ali bin Musa Harfush as governor of Palmyra's sanjak, dismissing him in 1584 for insubordination. In 1630 Palmyra came under the tax authority of another Lebanese emir, Fakhr-al-Din II, who renovated Shirkuh II's castle (which became known as Fakhr-al-Din al-Maani Castle). The prince fell from grace with the Ottomans in 1633 and lost control of the village, which remained a separate sanjak until it was absorbed by Zor Sanjak in 1857. The Ottoman governor of Syria, Mehmed Rashid Pasha, established a garrison in the village to control the Bedouin in 1867.\n\n20th century\nIn 1918, as World War I was ending, the Royal Air Force built an airfield for two planes, and in November the Ottomans retreated from Zor Sanjak without a fight. The Syrian Emirate's army entered Deir ez-Zor on 4 December, and Zor Sanjak became part of Syria. In 1919, as the British and French argued over the borders of the planned mandates, the British permanent military representative to the Supreme War Council Henry Wilson suggested adding Palmyra to the British mandate. However, the British general Edmund Allenby persuaded his government to abandon this plan. Syria (including Palmyra) became part of the French Mandate after Syria's defeat in the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920.\nWith Palmyra gaining importance in the French efforts to pacify the Syrian Desert, a base was constructed in the village near the Temple of Bel in 1921. In 1929, Henri Seyrig, began excavating the ruins and convinced the villagers to move to a new, French-built village next to the site. The relocation was completed in 1932; ancient Palmyra was ready for excavation as its villagers settled into the new village of Tadmur. During World War II, the Mandate came under the authority of Vichy France, who gave permission to Nazi Germany to use the airfield at Palmyra; forces of Free France, backed by British forces, invaded Syria in June 1941, and on 3 July 1941, the British took control over the city in the aftermath of a battle.\n\nSyrian civil war\nAs a result of the Syrian civil war, Palmyra experienced widespread looting and damage by combatants. In 2013, the façade of the Temple of Bel sustained a large hole from mortar fire, and colonnade columns have been damaged by shrapnel. According to Maamoun Abdulkarim, the Syrian Army positioned its troops in some archaeological-site areas, while Syrian opposition fighters positioned themselves in gardens around the city.\nOn 13 May 2015, ISIL launched an attack on the modern town of Tadmur, sparking fears that the iconoclastic group would destroy the adjacent ancient site of Palmyra. On 21 May, some artifacts were transported from the Palmyra museum to Damascus for safekeeping; a number of Greco-Roman busts, jewelry, and other objects looted from the museum have been found on the international market. ISIL forces entered Palmyra the same day. Local residents reported that the Syrian Air Force bombed the site on 13 June, damaging the northern wall close to the Temple of Baalshamin. During ISIL's occupation of the site, Palmyra's theatre was used as a place of public executions of their opponents and captives; videos were released by ISIL showing the killing of Syrian prisoners in front of crowds at the theatre. On 18 August, Palmyra's retired antiquities chief Khaled al-Asaad was beheaded by ISIL after being tortured for a month to extract information about the city and its treasures; al-Asaad refused to give any information to his captors.\nSyrian government forces supported by Russian airstrikes recaptured Palmyra on 27 March 2016 after intense fighting against ISIL fighters. According to initial reports, the damage to the archaeological site was less extensive than anticipated, with numerous structures still standing. Following the recapture of the city, Russian de-mining teams began clearing mines planted by ISIL prior to their retreat. Following heavy fighting, ISIL briefly reoccupied the city on 11 December 2016, prompting an offensive by the Syrian Army which retook the city on 2 March 2017.\nOn 7 December 2024, Palmyra was retaken by the Syrian Free Army. Damage to the city was heavy.\nSince the fall of Assad various plans and initiatives were disclosed in order to revitalize the area by numerous entities within Syria. One of such entities, the Syrian Liberal Party, currently led by Fahad al-Masri, advocated to turn Palmyra in an economic hub by connecting it by railways to major Syrian cities such as Damascus, Homs and Deir Ez-Zor and turn it into the main regional economic center. The SLP plan is to also construct oil refineries and networks of oil pipelines reaching Arabia, the Gulf States, Anatolia, Europe and Northern Africa. The Syrian transitional government stationed guards as to protect the area from further damage and has hinted at reconstruction programs in the following years, however, it has yet to give permission to license non-governmental organizations to send in experts to assess the damage to the ancient site and maybe act on it. Even foreign entities showcased their interest in investing in the region, with Turkiye planning to build a military base in the area.\n\nGovernment\nFrom the beginning of its history to the first century AD Palmyra was a petty sheikhdom, and by the first century BC a Palmyrene identity began to develop. During the first half of the first century AD, Palmyra incorporated some of the institutions of a Greek city (polis); the notion of an existing citizenship first appears in an inscription, dated to AD 10, mentioning the \"people of Palmyra\". In AD 74, an inscription mentions the city's boule (senate). The tribal role in Palmyra is debated; during the first century, four treasurers representing the four tribes seems to have partially controlled the administration but their role became ceremonial by the second century and power rested in the hands of the council.\nThe Palmyrene council consisted of about six hundred members of the local elite (such as the elders or heads of wealthy families or clans), representing the city's four-quarters. The council, headed by a president, managed civic responsibilities; it supervised public works (including the construction of public buildings), approved expenditures, collected taxes, and appointed two archons (lords) each year. Palmyra's military was led by strategoi (generals) appointed by the council. Roman provincial authority set and approved Palmyra's tariff structure, but the provincial interference in local government was kept minimal as the empire sought to ensure the continuous success of Palmyrene trade most beneficial to Rome. An imposition of direct provincial administration would have jeopardized Palmyra's ability to conduct its trading activities in the East, especially in Parthia.\nWith the elevation of Palmyra to a colonia around 213–216, the city ceased being subject to Roman provincial governors and taxes. Palmyra incorporated Roman institutions into its system while keeping many of its former ones. The council remained, and the strategos designated one of two annually-elected magistrates. This duumviri implemented the new colonial constitution, replacing the archons. Palmyra's political scene changed with the rise of Odaenathus and his family; an inscription dated to 251 describes Odaenathus' son Hairan I as \"Ras\" (lord) of Palmyra (exarch in the Greek section of the inscription) and another inscription dated to 252 describes Odaenathus with the same title. Odaenathus was probably elected by the council as exarch, which was an unusual title in the Roman empire and was not part of the traditional Palmyrene governance institutions. Whether Odaenathus' title indicated a military or a priestly position is unknown, but the military role is more likely. By 257 Odaenathus was known as a consularis, possibly the legatus of the province of Phoenice. In 258 Odaenathus began extending his political influence, taking advantage of regional instability caused by Sasanian aggression; this culminated in the Battle of Edessa, Odaenathus' royal elevation and mobilization of troops, which made Palmyra a kingdom.\nThe monarchy continued most civic institutions, but the duumviri and the council were no longer attested after 264; Odaenathus appointed a governor for the city. In the absence of the monarch, the city was administered by a viceroy. Although governors of the eastern Roman provinces under Odaenathus' control were still appointed by Rome, the king had overall authority. During Zenobia's rebellion, governors were appointed by the queen. Not all Palmyrenes accepted the dominion of the royal family; a senator, Septimius Haddudan, appears in a later Palmyrene inscription as aiding Aurelian's armies during the 273 rebellion. After the Roman destruction of the city, Palmyra was ruled directly by Rome, and then by a succession of other rulers, including the Burids and Ayyubids, and subordinate Bedouin chiefs—primarily the Fadl family, who governed for the Mamluks.\n\nMilitary\nDue to its military character and efficiency in battle, Palmyra was described by Irfan Shahîd as the \"Sparta among the cities of the Orient, Arab and other, and even its gods were represented dressed in military uniforms.\" Palmyra's army protected the city and its economy, helping extend Palmyrene authority beyond the city walls and protecting the countryside's desert trade routes. The city had a substantial military; Zabdibel commanded a force of 10,000 in the third century BC, and Zenobia led an army of 70,000 in the Battle of Emesa. Soldiers were recruited from the city and its territories, spanning several thousand square kilometers from the outskirts of Homs to the Euphrates valley. Non-Palmyrene soldiers were also recruited; a Nabatean cavalryman is recorded in 132 as serving in a Palmyrene unit stationed at Anah. Palmyra's recruiting system is unknown; the city might have selected and equipped the troops and the strategoi led, trained and disciplined them.\nThe strategoi were appointed by the council with the approval of Rome. The royal army in the mid 3rd century AD was under the leadership of the monarch aided by generals, and was modeled on the Sasanians in arms and tactics. The Palmyrenes were noted archers. They used infantry while a heavily armored cavalry (clibanarii) constituted the main attacking force. Palmyra's infantry was armed with swords, lances and small round shields; the clibanarii were fully armored (including their horses), and used heavy spears (kontos) 3.65 metres (12.0 ft) long without shields.\n\nRelations with Rome\nCiting the Palmyrenes' combat skills in large, sparsely populated areas, the Romans formed a Palmyrene auxilia to serve in the Imperial Roman army. Vespasian reportedly had 8,000 Palmyrene archers in Judea, and Trajan established the first Palmyrene Auxilia in 116 (a camel cavalry unit, Ala I Ulpia dromedariorum Palmyrenorum). Palmyrene units were deployed throughout the Roman Empire, serving in Dacia late in Hadrian's reign, and at El Kantara in Numidia and Moesia under Antoninus Pius. During the late second century Rome formed the Cohors XX Palmyrenorum, which was stationed in Dura-Europos.\n\nReligion\nPalmyra's gods were primarily part of the northwestern Semitic pantheon, with the addition of gods from the Mesopotamian and Arab pantheons. The city's chief pre-Hellenistic deity was called Bol, an abbreviation of Baal (a northwestern Semitic honorific). The Babylonian cult of Bel-Marduk influenced the Palmyrene religion and by 217 BC the chief deity's name was changed to Bel. This did not indicate the replacing of the northwestern Semitic Bol with a Mesopotamian deity, but was a mere change in the name.\nSecond in importance, after the supreme deity, were over sixty ancestral gods of the Palmyrene clans. Palmyra had unique deities, such as the god of justice and Efqa's guardian Yarhibol, the sun god Malakbel, and the moon god Aglibol. Palmyrenes worshiped regional deities, including the greater Levantine gods Astarte, Baal-hamon, Baalshamin and Atargatis; the Babylonian gods Nabu and Nergal, and the Arab Azizos, Arsu, Šams and Al-lāt.\nThe deities worshiped in the countryside were depicted as camel or horse riders and bore Arab names. The nature of those deities is uncertain as only names are known, most importantly Abgal. The Palmyrene pantheon included ginnaye (some were given the designation \"Gad\"), a group of lesser deities popular in the countryside, who were similar to the Arab jinn and the Roman genius. Ginnaye were believed to have the appearance and behavior of humans, similar to Arab jinn. Unlike jinn, however, the ginnaye could not possess or injure humans. Their role was similar to the Roman genius: tutelary deities who guarded individuals and their caravans, cattle and villages.\nAlthough the Palmyrenes worshiped their deities as individuals, some were associated with other gods. Bel had Astarte-Belti as his consort, and formed a triple deity with Aglibol and Yarhibol (who became a sun god in his association with Bel). Malakbel was part of many associations, pairing with Gad Taimi and Aglibol, and forming a triple deity with Baalshamin and Aglibol. Palmyra hosted an Akitu (spring festival) each Nisan. Each of the city's four-quarters had a sanctuary for a deity considered ancestral to the resident tribe; Malakbel and Aglibol's sanctuary was in the Komare quarter. The Baalshamin sanctuary was in the Ma'zin quarter, the Arsu sanctuary in the Mattabol quarter, and the Atargatis sanctuary in the fourth tribe's quarter.\n\nThe priests of Palmyra were selected from the city's leading families, and are recognized in busts through their headdresses which have the shape of a polos adorned with laurel wreath or other tree made of bronze among other elements. The high priest of Bel's temple was the highest religious authority and headed the clergy of priests who were organized into collegia each headed by a higher priest. The personnel of Efqa spring's sanctuary dedicated to Yarhibol belonged to a special class of priests as they were oracles. Palmyra's paganism was replaced with Christianity as the religion spread across the Roman Empire, and a bishop was reported in the city by 325. Although most temples became churches, the Temple of Al-lāt was destroyed in 385 at the order of Maternus Cynegius (the eastern praetorian prefect). After the Muslim conquest in 634 Islam gradually replaced Christianity, and the last known bishop of Palmyra was consecrated after 818.\n\nMalakbel and the Roman Sol Invictus\nIn 274, following his victory over Palmyra, Aurelian dedicated a large temple of Sol Invictus in Rome; most scholars consider Aurelian's Sol Invictus to be of Syrian origin, either a continuation of emperor Elagabalus cult of Sol Invictus Elagabalus, or Malakbel of Palmyra. The Palmyrene deity was commonly identified with the Roman god Sol and he had a temple dedicated for him on the right bank of the Tiber since the second century. Also, he bore the epithet Invictus and was known with the name Sol \"Sanctissimus\", the latter was an epithet Aurelian bore on an inscription from Capena.\nThe position of the Palmyrene deity as Aurelian's Sol Invictus is inferred from a passage by Zosimus reading: \"and the magnificent temple of the sun he (i.e. Aurelian) embellished with votive gifts from Palmyra, setting up statues of Helios and Bel\". Three deities from Palmyra exemplified solar features: Malakbel, Yarhibol and Šams, hence the identification of the Palmyrene Helios appearing in Zosimus' work with Malakbel. Some scholars criticize the notion of Malakbel's identification with Sol Invictus; according to Gaston Halsberghe, the cult of Malakbel was too local for it to become an imperial Roman god and Aurelian's restoration of Bel's temple and sacrifices dedicated to Malakbel were a sign of his attachment to the sun god in general and his respect to the many ways in which the deity was worshiped. Richard Stoneman suggested another approach in which Aurelian simply borrowed the imagery of Malakbel to enhance his own solar deity. The relation between Malakbel and Sol Invictus can not be confirmed and will probably remain unresolved.\n\nEconomy\nPalmyra's economy before and at the beginning of the Roman period was based on agriculture, pastoralism, and trade; the city served as a rest station for the caravans which sporadically crossed the desert. By the end of the first century BC, the city had a mixed economy based on agriculture, pastoralism, taxation, and, most importantly, the caravan trade. Taxation was an important source of revenue for the Palmyrene government. Caravaneers paid taxes in the building known as the Tariff Court, where a tax law dating to AD 137 was exhibited. The law regulated the tariffs paid by the merchants for goods sold at the internal market or exported from the city.\nThe classicist Andrew M. Smith II suggested that most land in Palmyra was owned by the city, which collected grazing taxes. The oasis had about 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) of irrigable land, which surrounded the city. The Palmyrenes constructed an extensive irrigation system in the northern mountains that consisted of reservoirs and channels to capture and store the occasional rainfall. The most notable irrigation work is Harbaqa Dam which was constructed in the late first century AD; it is located 48 km (30 mi) southwest of the city and can collect 140,000 cubic metres (4,900,000 cu ft) of water. Terebinth trees in the hinterland were an important source of charcoal, resin and oil; although evidence is lacking, it is possible that olive trees were also planted, and dairy products were produced in the villages; it is also apparent that barley was cultivated. However, agriculture could not support the population and food was imported.\nAfter Palmyra's destruction in 273, it became a market for villagers and nomads from the surrounding area. The city regained some of its prosperity during the Umayyad era, indicated by the discovery of a large Umayyad souq in the colonnaded street. Palmyra was a minor trading center until its destruction in 1400; according to Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, Timur's men took 200,000 sheep, and the city was reduced into a settlement on the desert border whose inhabitants herded and cultivated small plots for vegetables and corn.\n\nCommerce\nIf the Laghman II inscription in Afghanistan is referring to Palmyra, then the city's role in Central Asian overland trade was prominent as early as the third century BC. During the first centuries AD, Palmyra's main trade route ran east to the Euphrates where it connected at the city of Hīt. The route then ran south along the river toward the port of Charax Spasinu on the Persian Gulf, where Palmyrene ships traveled back and forth to India. Goods were imported from India, China and Transoxiana, and exported west to Emesa (or Antioch) then the Mediterranean ports, from which they were distributed throughout the Roman Empire. In addition to the usual route some Palmyrene merchants used the Red Sea, probably as a result of the Roman–Parthian Wars. Goods were carried overland from the seaports to a Nile port, and then taken to the Egyptian Mediterranean ports for export. Inscriptions attesting a Palmyrene presence in Egypt date to the reign of Hadrian.\nSince Palmyra was not on the main trading route (which followed the Euphrates), the Palmyrenes secured the desert route passing their city. They connected it to the Euphrates valley, providing water and shelter. The Palmyrene route connected the Silk Road with the Mediterranean, and was used almost exclusively by the city's merchants, who maintained a presence in many cities, including Dura-Europos in 33 BC, Babylon by AD 19, Seleucia by AD 24, Dendera, Coptos, Bahrain, the Indus River Delta, Merv and Rome.\nThe caravan trade depended on patrons and merchants. Patrons owned the land on which the caravan animals were raised, providing animals and guards for the merchants. The lands were located in the numerous villages of the Palmyrene countryside. Although merchants used the patrons to conduct business, their roles often overlapped and a patron would sometimes lead a caravan. Commerce made Palmyra and its merchants among the wealthiest in the region. Some caravans were financed by a single merchant, such as Male' Agrippa (who financed Hadrian's visit in 129 and the 139 rebuilding of the Temple of Bel). The primary income-generating trade good was silk, which was exported from the East to the West. Other exported goods included jade, muslin, spices, ebony, ivory and precious stones. For its domestic market Palmyra imported a variety of goods including slaves, prostitutes, olive oil, dyed goods, myrrh and perfume.\n\nResearch and excavations\nPalmyra's first scholarly description appeared in a 1695 paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society by William Hallifax followed by a 1696 book by Abednego Seller. In 1751, an expedition led by Robert Wood and James Dawkins studied Palmyra's architecture. French artist and architect Louis-François Cassas conducted an extensive survey of the city's monuments in 1785, publishing over a hundred drawings of Palmyra's civic buildings and tombs. Palmyra was photographed for the first time in 1864 by Louis Vignes. In 1882, the Palmyra Tariff, an inscribed stone slab from AD 137 in Greek and Palmyrene detailing import and export taxation, was discovered by prince Semyon Semyonovich Abamelik-Lazarev in the Tariff Court. It has been described by the historian John F. Matthews as \"one of the most important single items of evidence for the economic life of any part of the Roman Empire\". In 1901, the slab was gifted by the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II to the Russian Tsar and is now in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.\n\nPalmyra's first excavations were conducted in 1902 by Otto Puchstein and in 1917 by Theodor Wiegand. In 1929, French general director of antiquities of Syria and Lebanon Henri Seyrig began large-scale excavation of the site; interrupted by World War II, it resumed soon after the war's end. Seyrig started with the Temple of Bel in 1929 and between 1939 and 1940 he excavated the Agora. Daniel Schlumberger conducted excavations in the Palmyrene northwest countryside in 1934 and 1935 where he studied different local sanctuaries in the Palmyrene villages. From 1954 to 1956, a Swiss expedition organized by UNESCO excavated the Temple of Baalshamin. Since 1958, the site has been excavated by the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities, and Polish expeditions of the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw, led by many archaeologists including Kazimierz Michałowski (until 1980), Michał Gawlikowski (until 2009) and Grzegorz Majcherek (until now). The stratigraphic sounding beneath the Temple of Bel was conducted in 1967 by Robert du Mesnil du Buisson, who also discovered the Temple of Baal-hamon in the 1970s. In 1980, the historic site including the necropolis outside the walls was declared a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO.\nThe Polish expedition concentrated its work on the Camp of Diocletian while the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities excavated the Temple of Nabu. Most of the hypogea were excavated jointly by the Polish expedition and the Syrian Directorate, while the area of Efqa was excavated by Jean Starcky and Jafar al-Hassani. The Palmyrene irrigation system was discovered in 2008 by Jørgen Christian Meyer who researched the Palmyrene countryside through ground inspections and satellite images. Most of Palmyra still remains unexplored especially the residential quarters in the north and south while the necropolis has been thoroughly excavated by the Directorate and the Polish expedition. Excavation expeditions left Palmyra in 2011 due to the Syrian Civil War.\n\nSee also\nAureliano in Palmira\nCrisis of the Third Century\nPalmyrene (Unicode block)\nThirty Tyrants (Roman)\nSeptimius Worod\nZabdas\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nExternal links\n\nMetropolitan Museum of Art – Palmyra\nPalmyra.

          "summary": "Palmyra ( pal-MY-rə; Palmyrene Aramaic: 𐡶𐡣𐡬𐡥𐡴‎, romanized: Tadmor; Arabic: تَدْمُر‎, romanized: Tadmur) is an ancient city in central Syria. It is located in the eastern part of the Levant, and archaeological finds date back to the Neolithic period, and documents first mention the city in the early second millennium BCE. Palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of the Roman Empire in the first century CE.\nThe city grew wealthy from trade caravans; the Palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along the Silk Road and operated throughout the Roman Empire. Palmyra's wealth enabled the construction of monumental projects, such as the Great Colonnade, the Temple of Bel, and the distinctive tower tombs. Ethnically, the Palmyrenes combined elements of Amorites, Arameans, and Arabs. Socially structured around kinship and clans, Palmyra's inhabitants spoke Palmyrene Aramaic, a variety of Western Middle Aramaic, while using Koine Greek for commercial and diplomatic purposes. The Hellenistic period of West Asia influenced the culture of Palmyra, which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined different Mediterranean traditions. The city's inhabitants worshiped local Semitic, Mesopotamian, and Arab deities.\nBy the third century, Palmyra had become a prosperous regional center. It reached the apex of its power in the 260s, when the Palmyrene King Odaenathus defeated the Sasanian emperor Shapur I. The king was succeeded by queen regent Zenobia, who rebelled against Rome and established the Palmyrene Empire. In 273, Roman emperor Aurelian levelled the city, which was later restored by Diocletian at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to Christianity during the fourth century and to Islam in the centuries following the conquest by the seventh-century Rashidun Caliphate, after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by Arabic.\nBefore 273 CE, Palmyra enjoyed autonomy and was attached to the Roman province of Syria, having its political organization influenced by the Greek city-state model during the first two centuries CE. The city became a Roman colonia during the third century, leading to the incorporation of Roman governing institutions, before becoming a monarchy in 260. Following its razing in 273, Palmyra became a minor center under the Byzantines and later empires. Its destruction by the Timurids in 1400 reduced it to a small village. Under French Mandatory rule in 1932, the inhabitants were moved into the new village of Tadmur, and the ancient site became available for excavations. During the Syrian civil war in 2015, the Islamic State captured Palmyra and destroyed large parts of the ancient city, which was recaptured by the Syrian Army on 2 March 2017. It was then recaptured by the Syrian Free Army, after the fall of the Assad government in December 2024.",

          "content": "The Temple of Bel (Arabic: معبد بعل), sometimes also referred to as the \"Temple of Baal\", was an ancient temple located in Palmyra, Syria. The temple, consecrated to the Mesopotamian god Bel, worshipped at Palmyra in triad with the lunar god Aglibol and the sun god Yarhibol, formed the center of religious life in Palmyra and was dedicated in AD 32.  The temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire in a campaign against the temples of the East made by Maternus Cynegius, Praetorian Prefect of Oriens, between 25 May 385 to 19 March 388.      Its ruins were considered among the best preserved at Palmyra, until they were further destroyed by the Islamic State in August 2015. The arched main entrance into the temple is still intact, as well as its exterior walls and fortified gate.\n\nHistory\nThe temple was built on a tell with stratification indicating human occupation that goes back to the third millennium BC. The area was occupied in pre-Roman periods with a former temple that is usually referred to as \"the first temple of Bel\" and \"the Hellenistic temple\". The walls of the temenos and propylaea were constructed in the late first and the first half of the second century AD. The names of three Greeks who worked on the construction of the temple of Bel are known through inscriptions, including an architect named Alexandras (Greek: Αλεξάνδρας). However, many Palmyrenes adopted Greco-Roman names and native citizens with the name Alexander are attested in the city.\nThe Temple of Bel was converted into a Christian church during the Byzantine Era. Parts of the structure were modified by Arabs in 1132 which preserved the structure and converted the Temple into a mosque. The enormous temple courtyard (approx. 200 x 200 meters) held mud-brick houses among the ruins, and served as a fortified citadel for the village of Palmyra (known as Tadmur during the 1100s). The mosque in the temple proper and the dwellings remained in use until the 1920s when Franco-Syrian archaeological missions cleared the temple grounds of its postclassical elements. Most of the Corinthian columns of the inner colonnades still showed pedestals where the statues of the benefactors stood. The temple was aligned along the eastern end of the Great Colonnade at Palmyra.\n\nArchitecture\nThe temple showed a remarkable synthesis of ancient Near Eastern and Greek cultures. The temple remains lay inside a large precinct lined by porticos. It had a rectangular shape and was oriented north–south. It was based on a paved court surrounded by a massive 205-metre (673 ft) long wall with a propylaeum. On a podium in the middle of the court was the actual temple building. The cella was entirely surrounded by a prostyle of Corinthian columns, only interrupted on the long side by an entrance gate with large steps leading from the court. The cella was unique in the fact that it had two inner sanctuaries, the north and south adytons, dedicated as the shrines of Bel and other local deities. The northern chamber was known for a bas-relief carving of the seven planets known to the ancients surrounded by the twelve signs of the Zodiac and the carvings of a procession of camels and veiled women. The cella was lit by two pairs of windows cut high in the two long walls. In three corners of the building stairwells could be found that led up to rooftop terraces.\nIn the court there were the remains of a basin, an altar, a dining hall, and a building with niches. And in the northwest corner lay a ramp along which sacrificial animals were led into the temple area. There were three monumental gateways, of which the entry was through the west gate.\n\nDestruction\nSyria's Director of Antiquities Maamoun Abdul Karim stated that ISIL was looking for treasures and \"stores of gold\" in the city.\nOn 30 August 2015, the Associated Press reported that ISIS had partially demolished the temple by explosives, citing eyewitness accounts. The bricks and columns were reported as lying on the ground and only one wall was reported as remaining, according to a Palmyra resident. The damage was also attested by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\nSyria's antiquities chief Maamoun Abdulkarim later stated that although there was an explosion within the temple's perimeter, \"the basic structure is still standing\". However, these reports were proved to be incorrect.\nOn August 31, 2015 the United Nations confirmed the temple's destruction after reviewing satellite imagery, \"We can confirm destruction of the main building of the Temple of Bel as well as a row of columns in its immediate vicinity\" reported by the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). The BBC issued a video report showing the satellite images and the destruction described by Einar Bjorgo, manager of UN Satellite Imaging (UNOSAT UNITAR).\nThe main entrance arch survived the destruction of the temple. The Institute for Digital Archaeology proposed that replicas of this arch be installed in Trafalgar Square, London and Times Square, New York City. It was later decided that instead of the temple's main entrance, the replica would be of part of the Monumental Arch.\n\nRestoration\nFollowing the recapture of Palmyra by the Syrian Army in March 2016, director of antiquities Maamoun Abdelkarim stated that the Temple of Bel, along with the Temple of Baalshamin and the Monumental Arch, will be rebuilt using the surviving remains. ISIL recaptured the city on 11 December, but the Syrian Army retook it on 2 March 2017.\nIn July 2017, the French company \"Art Graphique et Patrimoine\" travelled to Palmyra and scanned the Temple's rubble in order to create a plan for its restoration.\n\nDigital Reconstructions\nThe destruction of the Temple of Bel coincided with a boom in digital documentation and reconstruction technologies, and motivated a number of research and digital heritage organizations to engage in reconstruction projects. As the temple had been a popular tourist destination in Syria for many years, a great many images existed which portrayed the temple from many angles and viewpoints, making it an ideal candidate for photogrammetric reconstruction. Wissam Wahbeh and Stephen Nebiker, Researchers at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland demonstrated this capability, created a 3D model using tourist images along with proprietary data held by photogrammetry pioneer Gabriele Fangi. The New Palmyra Project organized the donation of over 3,000 high resolution images and published the collection as open data on Flickr.com, which is ideal for reconstruction as the platform preserves image metadata enabling complex matching of images from multiple sources. A comprehensive version, featuring full resolution reconstructions of reliefs, frescoes, and finely detailed decorative features, along with the raw data, was later published by UC San Diego Data Scientist Scott McAvoy in the hopes of encouraging continued collaboration informing future reconstruction efforts.\n\nImage gallery\nSee also\nList of Ancient Roman temples\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBecker, Jeffrey A.

          "content": "Bosra (Arabic: بُصْرَىٰ, romanized: Buṣrā), formerly Bostra (Greek: Βόστρα) and officially called Busra al-Sham (Arabic: بُصْرَىٰ ٱلشَّام, romanized: Buṣrā al-Shām), is a town in southern Syria, administratively belonging to the Daraa District of the Daraa Governorate and geographically part of the Hauran region.\nBosra is an ancient city mentioned in 14th century BC Egyptian sources. A key Nabatean city, it became the prosperous provincial capital of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea following the dissolution of the Nabatean kingdom. With the advent of Christianity Bostra flourished as a Metropolitan Archbishopric under the jurisdiction of Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East. It also became a Latin Catholic titular see and the episcopal see of a Melkite Catholic Archeparchy.\nThroughout its history under various Muslim rulers the city maintained its strategic importance as Syria's southern gateway. It attracted attention from Damascus' rulers and was governed by various lords, serving as a hub for Islamic learning and endowments. However it declined into a village during the Ottoman era, only to be revitalized in the 20th century with the construction of the Hijaz railway and growing archaeological interest, later prompting tourism-focused development by the Syrian government. Today it is a major archaeological site and has been declared by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.\nAccording to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) Bosra had a population of 19,683 in the 2004 census. It is the administrative center of the nahiyah (\"subdistrict\") of Bosra, which consisted of nine localities with a total population of 33,839 in 2004. Bosra's inhabitants are predominantly Sunni Muslim, although the town has a small Shia Muslim community.\n\nHistory\nBosra was the first Nabatean city in the 2nd century BC. The Nabatean Kingdom was conquered by Cornelius Palma, a general of Trajan, in 106 AD.\nAccording to John Malalas it was called Bostra (Ancient Greek: Βόστρα) after Bostras, a Roman general who was dispatched to the country.\n\nRoman period\nUnder the Roman Empire Bosra was renamed Nova Trajana Bostra and was the residence of the legio III Cyrenaica. It was made capital of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea. The city flourished and became a major metropolis at the juncture of several trade routes, in particular the Via Traiana Nova, a Roman road that connected Damascus to the Red Sea. It became an important centre for food production and during the reign of Emperor Philip the Arab Bosra began to mint its own coins. The two Councils of Arabia were held at Bosra in 246 and 247 AD.  The Babylonian Talmud and Jerusalem Talmud mention Bosra as a town on the border outside Israel, but with a sizeable Jewish population. In the Jerusalem Talmud, it states that Resh Lakish was in Bosra when he saw them sprinkling water to the goddess Aphrodite.  In the Babylonian Talmud, tractate Avoda Zara (58b) it likewise mentions how Resh Lakish interacted with the population in Bosra. There are also rabbis who were identified as the sage from Bosra, such as Rabbi Jonah of Bosra.  The Talmud (Shabbat 29b) also notes that there was a synagogue in Bosra.\n\nByzantine period\nBy the Byzantine period, which began in the 5th century, Christianity had become the dominant religion in Bosra (Βόσρα in Greek-Byzantine). The city became a Metropolitan archbishop's seat (see below) and a large cathedral was built in the 6th century. Bosra was conquered by the Sasanian Persians in the early 7th century but was recaptured during the Byzantine reconquest.\n\nIslamic era\nBosra played an important part in the early life of Muhammad, as described in the entry for the Christian monk Bahira. The forces of the Rashidun Caliphate under general Khalid ibn al-Walid captured the city from the Byzantines in the Battle of Bosra in 634. Throughout Islamic rule Bosra would serve as the southernmost outpost of Bilad al-Sham, its prosperity being mostly contingent on the political importance of that city. Bosra held additional significance as a centre of the pilgrim caravan between Damascus and the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina, the destinations of the annual hajj pilgrimage. Early Islamic rule did not alter the general architecture of Bosra, with only two structures dating to the Umayyad era (721 and 746) when Damascus was the capital of the Caliphate. As Bosra's inhabitants gradually converted to Islam the Roman-era holy sites were utilized for Muslim practices. In the 9th century, Ya'qubi wrote that Bosra was the capital of the Hauran province.\n\nAfter the end of the Umayyad era in 750, major activity in Bosra ceased for around 300 years until the late 11th century. In the last years of Fatimid rule, in 1068, a number of building projects were commissioned. With the advent of Seljuk rule in 1076 increasing focus was paid to Bosra's defences. In particular the Roman theatre was transformed into a fortress, with a new floor added to the interior staircase tower. With the coming to power of the Burid dynasty in Damascus, the general Kumushtakin was allotted the entireHauran plain as a fief by the atabeg Tughtakin. Under Kumushtakin, efforts to enhance the Muslim nature of the city increased with the construction of a number of Islamic edifices. One of these projects was the restoration of the Umari Mosque, which had been built by the Umayyads in 721. Another mosque commissioned was the smaller al-Khidr Mosque at the northwestern part of the city, which was established under Kumushtakin in 1134. Kumushtakin also had a madrasa constructed alongside the Muslim shrine honoring the mabrak an-naqa (\"camel's knees\"), which marked the imprints of the camel the prophet Muhammad rode on when he entered Bosra in the early 7th century. In 1147 King Baldwin III of Jerusalem led a Crusader force to capture the city but his attempt was thwarted since the Damascene army led by Mu'in ad-Din Unur managed to garrison Bosra's citadel.\nA golden age of political and architectural activity in Bosra began during the reign of Ayyubid sultan al-Adil I (1196–1218). One of the first architectural developments in the city was the construction of eight large external towers in the Roman theatre-turned-fortress. The project began in 1202 and was completed in 1253, towards the end of the Ayyubid period. The two northern corner towers alone occupied more space than the remaining six. After al-Adil's death in 1218 his son as-Salih Ismail inherited the fief of Bosra and lived in its newly fortified citadel. During Ismail's rule Bosra gained political prominence. Ismail used the city as his base when he claimed the sultanate in Damascus on two separate occasions, reigning between 1237–38 and 1239–45.\n\nOttoman era\nIn 1596 Bosra appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as Nafs Busra, being part of the nahiyah of Bani Nasiyya in the Qada of Hauran. It had a Muslim population consisting of 75 households and 27 bachelors, and a Christian population of 15 households and 8 bachelors. Taxes were paid on wheat, barley, summer crops, fruit- or other trees,  goats and/or beehives and water mill.\nWhen James Silk Buckingham visited Bosra in 1816, he described \"a large ruined edifice, which was originally an oblong square, with one semicircular end,\" containing \"a miserable work of the Greek Christians, by whom it was no doubt used as a place of worship up to the period of its destruction.\" He also noted \"an old building, with a high square tower attached to it… with many Arabic inscriptions in different parts of it,\" as well as another plain building \"with crosses sculptured in the doors and walls, and the whole appearance that of an early place of Christian worship.\" Among the structures of Bosra he was shown was the Serait-el-Bint-el-Yahoodi or \"Palace of the Jew's Daughter,\" though he could not \"learn the origin of this name, or obtain an account of any tradition connected with it.\" He remarked further on the El-Hamam bath, with pointed arches in alternating black and white stone, and on \"a large building entirely constructed out of the ruins of more ancient edifices,\" containing \"Cufic, Arabic, and Greek\" inscriptions and \"a mixture of antiquity and freshness, of wealth and poverty, of skill and ignorance.\" He described ascending a great square tower of sixty-four steps, with stone doors on its stages and an open space at the top, from which \"we enjoyed a commanding view of the ruins of Bosra.\" Buckingham also saw \"a Roman arched gateway, not unlike that of Jerash,\" Corinthian colonnades standing in the town's streets, and the castle of Bosra, which he thought showed \"a mixture of styles which rendered it exceedingly difficult to say in what age or by what people they were constructed,\" containing Roman sculpture and Arabic inscriptions dated to 722 AH.\nAccording to the 1914 Ottoman population statistics, the district of Busra had a total population of 26.355, consisting of 22.485 Muslims, 3.096 Orthodox Greeks, 594 Catholic Greeks, and 180 Protestants.\n\nModern era\nToday Bosra is a major archaeological site, containing ruins from Roman, Byzantine and Muslim times, its main feature being the well-preserved Roman theatre. Every year a national music festival is held in the main theatre.\nSignificant social and economic changes have affected Bosra since the end of the French Mandate in 1946. Whereas until the 1950s the shopkeepers of Bosra were from Damascus, since then most have lived in the town. In the late Ottoman era and the French Mandate period the agricultural relationship was between the small landowner and the sharecroppers, but since the agrarian reforms in the late 1950s and 1960s the relevant relationship has been between the landowners and the wage laborers. Many of its residents have found work in the Gulf Cooperation Council states, sending the proceeds to their relatives in Bosra. Social changes and increased access to education have largely diminished traditional clan life according to historian Hanna Batatu.\nDuring the presidency of Hafez al-Assad (1970–2000), Bosra and the surrounding villages were largely free of government interference and for the most part were politically dominated by members of the prominent al-Mokdad clan, who served as intermediaries of sorts between the residents of the town and the governor of Daraa and the Ba'ath Party branch secretary.\nOn 14 October 2012, there was intense gunfire from government forces stationed at checkpoints on the main road running through the town. On 13 November 2012, fierce fighting was reported in the east of the town. By January 2013, after 22 months of conflict during the ongoing Syrian Civil War, some refugees fleeing Bosra were speaking of escalating violence, with many bodies being left in the streets. On 15 January 2013, it was reported that the citadel was used by the army to shell the town on a daily basis. After the beginning of February 2014 the city was under the control of the Syrian Army. However on 31 January 2015, the Army's 5th Division confronted a contingent from the rebels near the famous Roman theatre – fierce firefights broke out between the groups. On 1 February 2015, the Army forces shelled areas in the east of the town. On 25 March 2015, Syrian rebels seized the town, ousting Syrian soldiers and allied militiamen after four days of intense battle.\nBosra was recaptured by the Syrian Arab Army on 2 July 2018 following the surrender of the rebel forces. The recapture was a part of the Daraa Offensive, which involved the surrender and/or reconciliation of many rebel groups in the area.\n\nLandmarks\nOf the city that once counted 80,000 inhabitants there remains today only a village among the ruins. The 2nd-century Roman theatre of Bosra, constructed probably under Trajan, is the only monument of this type with its upper gallery in the form of a covered portico fully preserved. It was fortified between 481 and 1231.\nThere are also Nabatean and Roman monuments, Christian churches, mosques, and Madrasahs within the half-ruined enceinte of the city. The structure of the cathedral, a central plan with eastern apses flanked by two sacristies, exerted a decisive influence on the evolution of Christian architectural forms and to a certain extent on Islamic style. Al-Omari Mosque of Bosra is one of the oldest surviving mosques in Islamic history.\nClose by are the Kharaba Bridge and the Gemarrin Bridge, both Roman bridges.\n\nClimate\nBosra has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSk). Rainfall is higher in winter than in summer. The average annual temperature in Bosra is 16.4 °C (61.5 °F). About 247 mm (9.72 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nDemographics\nIn the late 1990s, Bosra had an estimated population of 12,000. Its population increased to 19,683 according to the 2004 census by the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics. The population of its metropolitan area was 33,839.\nBosra's inhabitants are predominantly Sunni Muslims and are mostly divided between seven major clans. The leading clan is the al-Miqdad whose members immigrated to Bosra from al-Suwayda in the mid-18th-century. During this era they also dominated the nearby villages of Ghasm, Maaraba and Samaqiyat. However, the oldest clan of Bosra are the Hamd, a largely fair-skinned people, many members of which have blond hair and blue eyes. They claim to be descendants of the ancient Roman governor of Bosra, although other townspeople believe they are of Crusader origins. Regarding land ownership, the Hamd clan owns around 1,000 hectares in the town while the al-Miqdad clan owns roughly 12,000. The latter's members were historically influential in the Hauran region and beyond, having had one of their own in the Ottoman parliament of Abdul Hamid II in Constantinople during the Young Turks period and in the Syrian parliament during the French Mandate period. As of the late 1990s, members of the al-Miqdad clan occupied the positions of mayor, the chief imam of the main al-Omari Mosque, the chief of the town's bureau of antiquities as well as manager of Bosra's carpet workshop and the owner of the principal coffeehouse. While their members traditionally resided in the eastern quarter of old Bosra, they are currently prevalent throughout the town.\nBosra also has a small Shia Muslim community of some fifty families. According to Palestinian American historian Hanna Batatu, the Shia inhabitants of Bosra were \"relatively recent arrivals\" and immigrated to the town from the city of Nabatieh in South Lebanon. Most of the working members of the Shia community are artisans or laborers. Batatu also asserts that social changes in Bosra since Syrian independence have led to tribal diffusion, with intermarriage between the clans and between the Sunni and Shia communities having increased significantly.\n\nNotable people\nSaint Timon the Deacon, 1st century, Christian proto-deacon and bishop of Bosra\nBeryllus of Bostra, 3rd century, Bishop\nShimon ben Lakish, 3rd century, amora of the second generation and rabbi\nTitus of Bostra, fl. 4th century, Christian theologian\nSaint Antipater of Bostra, fl. 5th century, Christian bishop\nBahira, c. 600, Assyrian monk\nIbn Kathir (1301–1373), Islamic scholar\n\nReferences\nSources\nBatatu, H.

          "content": "Krak des Chevaliers (French: [kʁak de ʃ(ə)valje]; Arabic: قلعة الحصن, romanized: Qalʿat al-Ḥiṣn, Arabic: [ˈqalʕat alˈħisˤn]; Old French: Crac des Chevaliers or Crac de l'Ospital, lit. 'karak [fortress] of the hospital'; from Classical Syriac: ܟܪܟܐ, romanized: karəḵā, lit. 'walled city') is a medieval castle in Syria and one of the most important preserved medieval castles in the world. The site was first inhabited in the 11th century by Kurdish troops garrisoned there by the Mirdasids. In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the order of the Knights Hospitaller. It remained occupied by them until it was reconquered by the Muslims in 1271.\nThe Hospitallers began rebuilding the castle in the 1140s and were finished by 1170 when an earthquake damaged the castle. The order controlled castles along the border of the County of Tripoli, a state founded after the First Crusade. Krak des Chevaliers was among the most important and acted as a center of administration as well as a military base. After a second phase of building was undertaken in the 13th century, Krak des Chevaliers became a concentric castle. This phase created the outer wall and gave the castle its current appearance. The first half of the century has been described as Krak des Chevaliers' \"golden age\". At its peak, Krak des Chevaliers housed a garrison of around 2,000. Such a large garrison allowed the Hospitallers to exact tribute from a wide area. From the 1250s the fortunes of the Knights Hospitaller took a turn for the worse and in 1271 the Mamluk Sultanate captured Krak des Chevaliers after a siege lasting 36 days, supposedly by way of a forged letter purportedly from the Hospitallers' Grand Master that caused the knights to surrender.\nRenewed interest in Crusader castles in the 19th century led to the investigation of Krak des Chevaliers, and architectural plans were drawn up. In the late 19th or early 20th century a settlement had been created within the castle, causing damage to its fabric. The 500 inhabitants were moved in 1933 and the castle was given over to the French Alawite State, which carried out a program of clearing and restoration. When Syria declared independence in 1946, it assumed control.\nToday, the village of al-Husn exists around the castle and has a population of nearly 9,000. Krak des Chevaliers is approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) west of the city of Homs, close to the border of Lebanon, and is administratively part of the Homs Governorate. Since 2006, the castles of Krak des Chevaliers and Qal'at Salah El-Din have been recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. It was partially damaged in the Syrian civil war from shelling and recaptured by the Syrian government forces in 2014. Since then, reconstruction and conservation work on the site had begun. Reports by UNESCO and the Syrian government on the state of the site are produced yearly.\n\nEtymology\n\"Krak\" is derived from karak, the Syriac word for a walled city or fortress. Before the arrival of the crusaders, the local Arab ruler had established a fortification on the site manned by Kurds, giving it the name, in Arabic, of Ḥoṣn al-Akrād (حصن الأكراد), or \"fort of the Kurds\". Following the construction of the present castle, the crusaders (whose elite spoke either Old French or, in Tripoli, possibly Old Occitan) corrupted that name into Le Crat and then, as a result of confusing it with karak, the name evolved into Le Crac.\nBecause of its association with the Knights Hospitallers, it was known as Crac de l'Ospital (Fortress of the Hospital) during the Middle Ages. The name was later romanticised to become Krak des Chevaliers in French in the 19th century, meaning \"Fortress of the Knights\".\n\nLocation\nThe castle sits atop a 650-metre-high (2,130 ft) hill east of Tartus, Syria, in the Homs Gap. On the other side of the gap, 27 kilometres (17 mi) away, was the 12th-century castle of Gibelacar (Hisn Ibn Akkar). The route through the strategically important Homs Gap connects the cities of Tripoli and Homs. To the north of the castle lies the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range, and to the south, Lebanon. The surrounding area is fertile, benefiting from streams and abundant rainfall. Compared to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the other Crusader states had less land suitable for farming; however, the limestone peaks of Tripoli were well-suited to defensive sites.\nProperty in the County of Tripoli, granted to the Knights in the 1140s, included the Krak des Chevaliers, the towns of Rafanea and Montferrand, and the Beqa'a plain separating Homs and Tripoli. Homs was never under Crusader control, so the region around the Krak des Chevaliers was vulnerable to expeditions from the city. While its proximity caused the Knights problems with regard to defending their territory, it also meant Homs was close enough for them to raid. Because of the castle's command of the plain, it became the Knights' most important base in the area.\n\nHistory\nOrigins and Crusader period\nAccording to the 13th-century Arab historian Ibn Shaddad, in 1031, the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo and Homs, Shibl ad-Dawla Nasr, established a settlement of Kurdish tribesmen at the site of the castle, which was then known as \"Ḥiṣn al-Safḥ\". Nasr restored Hisn al-Safh to help reestablish the Mirdasids' access to the coast of Tripoli after they lost nearby Hisn Ibn Akkar to the Fatimids in 1029. Due to Nasr's garrisoning of Kurdish troops at the site, the castle became known as \"Ḥiṣn al-Akrād\" (Fortress of the Kurds). The castle was strategically located at the southern edge of the Jibal al-Alawiyin mountain range and dominated the road between Homs and Tripoli. When building castles, engineers often chose elevated sites, such as hills and mountains, that provided natural obstacles.\nIn January 1099, on the journey to Jerusalem during the First Crusade, the company of Raymond IV of Toulouse came under attack from the garrison of Hisn al-Akrad, the forerunner of the Krak, who harried Raymond's foragers. The following day, Raymond marched on the castle and found it deserted. The crusaders briefly occupied the castle in February of the same year but abandoned it when they continued their march towards Jerusalem. Permanent occupation began in 1110 when Tancred, Prince of Galilee took control of the site. The early castle was substantially different from the extant remains, and no trace of this first castle survives at the site.\nThe origins of the order of the Knights Hospitaller are unclear, but it probably emerged around the 1070s in Jerusalem. It started as a religious order that cared for the sick, and later looked after pilgrims to the Holy Land. After the success of the First Crusade in capturing Jerusalem in 1099, many Crusaders donated their new property in the Levant to the Hospital of St John. Early donations were in the newly formed Kingdom of Jerusalem, but over time the order extended its holdings to the Crusader states of the County of Tripoli and the Principality of Antioch. Evidence suggests that in the 1130s, the order became militarised when Fulk, King of Jerusalem, granted the newly built castle at Beth Gibelin to the order in 1136. A papal bull from between 1139 and 1143 may indicate the order hiring people to defend pilgrims. There were also other military orders, such as the Knights Templar, that offered protection to pilgrims.\n\nBetween 1142 and 1144 Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, granted property in the county to the order. According to historian Jonathan Riley-Smith, the Hospitallers effectively established a \"palatinate\" within Tripoli. The property included castles with which the Hospitallers were expected to defend Tripoli. Along with Krak des Chevaliers, the Hospitallers were given four other castles along the borders of the state, which allowed the order to dominate the area. The order's agreement with Raymond II stated that if he did not accompany knights of the order on campaign, the spoils belonged entirely to the order, and if he was present it was split equally between the count and the order. Further, Raymond II could not make peace with the Muslims without the permission of the Hospitallers. The Hospitallers made Krak des Chevaliers a center of administration for their new property, undertaking work at the castle that would make it one of the most elaborate Crusader fortifications in the Levant.\nAfter acquiring the site in 1142, they began building a new castle to replace the former Kurdish fortification. This work lasted until 1170, when an earthquake damaged the castle. An Arab source mentions that the quake destroyed the castle's chapel, which was replaced by the present chapel. In 1163, the Crusaders emerged victorious over Nur ad-Din in the Battle of al-Buqaia near Krak des Chevaliers.\nDrought conditions between 1175 and 1180 prompted the Crusaders to sign a two-year truce with the Muslims, but without Tripoli included in the terms. During the 1180s, raids by Christians and Muslims into each other's territory became more frequent. In 1180, Saladin ventured into the County of Tripoli, ravaging the area. Unwilling to meet him in open battle, the Crusaders retreated to the relative safety of their fortifications. Without capturing the castles, Saladin could not secure control of the area, and once he retreated the Hospitallers were able to revitalise their damaged lands. The Battle of Hattin in 1187 was a disastrous defeat for the Crusaders: Guy of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem, was captured, as was the True Cross, a relic discovered during the First Crusade. Afterwards, Saladin ordered the execution of the captured Templar and Hospitaller knights, such was the importance of the two orders in defending the Crusader states. After the battle, the Hospitaller castles of Belmont, Belvoir, and Bethgibelin fell to Muslim armies. Following these losses, the Order focused its attention on its castles in Tripoli. In May 1188, Saladin led an army to attack Krak des Chevaliers, but on seeing the castle, decided it was too well defended and instead marched on the Hospitaller castle of Margat, which he also failed to capture.\nAnother earthquake struck in 1202, and it may have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace of it has been discovered.\n\nThe first half of the 13th century has been characterised as Krak des Chevaliers' \"golden age\". While other Crusader strongholds came under threat, Krak des Chevaliers and its garrison of 2,000 soldiers dominated the surrounding area. It was effectively the center of a principality which remained in Crusader hands until 1271, and was the only major inland area to remain constantly under Crusader control during this period. Crusaders who passed through the area would often stop at the castle, and probably made donations. King Andrew II of Hungary visited in 1218 and proclaimed the castle the \"key of the Christian lands\". He was so impressed with the castle that he gave a yearly income of 60 marks to the Master and 40 to the brothers. Geoffroy de Joinville, uncle of the noted chronicler of the Crusades Jean de Joinville, died at Krak des Chevaliers in 1203 or 1204 and was buried in the castle's chapel.\nThe main contemporary accounts relating to Krak des Chevaliers are of Muslim origin and tend to emphasise Muslim success while overlooking setbacks against the Crusaders, although they suggest that the Knights Hospitaller forced the settlements of Hama and Homs to pay tribute to the Order. This situation lasted as long as Saladin's successors warred between themselves. The proximity of Krak des Chevaliers to Muslim territories allowed it to take on an offensive role, acting as a base from which neighboring areas could be attacked. By 1203, the garrison was making raids on Montferrand (which was under Muslim control) and Hama, and in 1207 and 1208 the castle's soldiers took part in an attack on Homs. Krak des Chevaliers acted as a base for expeditions to Hama in 1230 and 1233 after the amir refused to pay tribute. The former was unsuccessful, but the 1233 expedition was a show of force that demonstrated the importance of Krak des Chevaliers.\n\nIn the 1250s, the fortunes of the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers took a turn for the worse. A Muslim army estimated to number 10,000 men ravaged the countryside around the castle in 1252, after which the Order's finances declined sharply. In 1268, Master Hugues Revel complained that the area, previously home to around 10,000 people, now stood deserted and that the Order's property in the Kingdom of Jerusalem produced little income. He also noted that by this point there were only 300 of the Order's brethren left in the east. On the Muslim side, in 1260 Baibars became Sultan of Egypt, following his overthrow of the incumbent ruler Qutuz, and went on to unite Egypt and Syria. As a result, Muslim settlements that had previously paid tribute to the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers no longer felt intimidated into doing so.\nAs for Hugues Revel, some of the castellans of this castle are identified: Pierre de Mirmande (Grand Commander) and Geoffroy le Rat (Grand Master).\nBaibars ventured into the area around Krak des Chevaliers in 1270 and allowed his men to graze their animals on the fields around the castle. When he received news that year of the Eighth Crusade led by King Louis IX of France, Baibars left for Cairo to avoid a confrontation. After Louis died in 1271, Baibars returned to deal with Krak des Chevaliers. Before he marched on the castle, the Sultan captured the smaller castles in the area, including Chastel Blanc. On 3 March, Baibars' army arrived at Krak des Chevaliers. By the time the Sultan appeared on the scene, the castle may already have been blockaded by Mamluk forces for several days. Of the three Arabic accounts of the siege, only one was contemporary, that of Ibn Shaddad, who was not present at the siege. Peasants who lived in the area had fled to the castle for safety and were kept in the outer ward. As soon as Baibars arrived, he erected mangonels, powerful siege weapons which he would later turn on the castle. In a probable reference to a walled suburb outside the castle's entrance, Ibn Shaddad records that two days later the first line of defences fell to the besiegers.\nRain interrupted the siege, but on 21 March, immediately south of Krak des Chevaliers, Baibar's forces captured a triangular outwork possibly defended by a timber palisade. On 29 March, the attackers undermined a tower in the southwest corner, causing it to collapse whereupon Baibars' army attacked through the breach. In the outer ward, they encountered the peasants who had sought refuge in the castle. Though the outer ward had fallen, with a handful of the garrison killed in the process, the Crusaders retreated to the more formidable inner ward. After a lull of ten days, the besiegers conveyed a letter to the garrison, supposedly from the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Tripoli, which granted permission, (aman), for them to surrender on 8 April 1271. Although the letter was a forgery, the garrison capitulated and the Sultan spared their lives. The new owners of the castle undertook repairs, focused mainly on the outer ward. The Hospitaller chapel was converted to a mosque and two mihrabs (prayer niches) were added to the interior.\n\nLater history\nDuring the Ottoman period (1516–1918), the castle housed a company of local janissaries and was the centre of the nahiye (tax district) of Hisn al-Akrad, attached first to the Tripoli Sanjak and later Homs, both part of the Tripoli Eyalet. The castle itself was commanded by a dizdar (castle warden). Several Turkmen and Kurdish tribes were settled in the area, and in the 18th century the district was mainly controlled by local notables from the Dandashi family. In 1894, the Ottoman government considered stationing a company of auxiliary soldiers there, but revised its plans after deciding the castle was too old and access too difficult. As a result, the capital of the district was then moved to nearby Talkalakh.\nAfter the Franks were driven from the Holy Land in 1291, European familiarity with the castles of the Crusades declined. It was not until the 19th century that interest in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Emmanuel Guillaume-Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871, he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; which included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.\nPaul Deschamps visited the castle in February 1927. Since Rey had visited in the 19th century, a village of 500 people had been established within the castle. Renewed inhabitation had damaged the site: underground vaults had been used as rubbish tips and in some places the battlements had been destroyed. Deschamps and fellow architect François Anus attempted to clear some of the detritus; General Maurice Gamelin assigned 60 Alawite soldiers to help. Deschamps left in March 1927, and work resumed when he returned two years later. The culmination of Deschamp's work at the castle was the publication of Les Châteaux des Croisés en Terre Sainte I: le Crac des Chevaliers in 1934, with detailed plans by Anus. The survey has been widely praised, described as \"brilliant and exhaustive\" by military historian D. J. Cathcart King in 1949 and \"perhaps the finest account of the archaeology and history of a single medieval castle ever written\" by historian Hugh Kennedy in 1994.\nAs early as 1929, there were suggestions that the castle should be taken under French control. On 16 November 1933, Krak des Chevaliers was given into the control of the French state, and cared for by the Académie des Beaux-Arts. The villagers were moved and paid F1 million between them in compensation. Over the following two years, a programme of cleaning and restoration was carried out by a force of 120 workers. Once finished, Krak des Chevaliers was one of the key tourist attractions in the French Levant. Pierre Coupel, who had undertaken similar work at the Tower of the Lions and the two castles at Sidon, supervised the work. Despite the restoration, no archaeological excavations were carried out. The Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, which had been established in 1920, ended in 1946 with the declaration of Syrian independence. The castle was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, along with Qal'at Salah El-Din, in 2006, and is owned by the Syrian government.\n\nSeveral of the castle's former residents built their houses outside the fortress and a village called al-Husn has since developed. Many of the al-Husn's roughly 9,000 Muslims residents benefit economically from the tourism generated by the site.\nThe Syrian Civil War began in 2011, prompting UNESCO to raise concerns that the war might damage cultural sites including Krak des Chevaliers. The castle was shelled in August 2012 by the Syrian Arab Army, damaging the Crusader chapel. It was damaged again in July 2013 by an airstrike conducted by the Syrian Arab Air Force during the Siege of Homs, and once more on 18 August 2013. The Syrian Arab Army captured the castle and village after the Battle of Hosn in March 2014. Since then, UNESCO has published periodic reports about the state of the site, reconstruction and conservation measures.\n\nArchitecture\nWriting in the early 20th century, T. E. Lawrence, popularly known as Lawrence of Arabia, remarked that Krak des Chevaliers was \"perhaps the best preserved and most wholly admirable castle in the world, [a castle which] forms a fitting commentary on any account of the Crusading buildings of Syria\". Castles in Europe provided lordly accommodation for their owners and were centers of administration; in the Levant the need for defence was paramount and was reflected in castle design. Kennedy suggests that \"The castle scientifically designed as a fighting machine surely reached its apogee in great buildings like Margat and Crac des Chevaliers.\"\n\nKrak des Chevaliers can be classified both as a spur castle, due to its site, and after the 13th-century expansion a fully developed concentric castle. It was similar in size and layout to Vadum Jacob, a Crusader castle built in the late 1170s. Margat has also been cited as Krak des Chevaliers' sister castle. The main building material at Krak des Chevaliers was limestone; the ashlar facing is so fine that the mortar is barely noticeable. Outside the castle's entrance was a \"walled suburb\" known as a burgus, no trace of which remains. To the south of the outer ward was a triangular outwork and the Crusaders may have intended to build stone walls and towers around it. It is unknown how it was defended at the time of the 1271 siege, though it has been suggested it was surrounded by a timber palisade. South of the castle, the spur on which it stands is connected to the next hill, so that siege engines can approach on level ground. The inner defences are strongest at this point, with a cluster of towers connected by a thick wall.\n\nInner ward\nBetween 1142 and 1170, the Knights Hospitaller undertook a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers on the eastern side, and there was a postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The lay of the land dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.\n\nWhen Krak des Chevaliers was remodelled in the 13th century, new walls surrounding the inner court were built. They followed the earlier walls, with a narrow gap between them in the west and south, which was turned into a gallery from which defenders could unleash missiles. In this area, the walls were supported by a steeply sloping glacis which provided additional protection against both siege weapons and earthquakes. Four large, round towers project vertically from the glacis; they were used as accommodation for the Knights of the garrison, about 60 at its peak. The southwest tower was designed to house the rooms of the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller. Though the defences which once crested the walls of the inner wards no longer survive in most places, it seems that they did not extend for the entire circuit. Machicolations were absent from the southern face. The area between the inner court and the outer walls was narrow and not used for accommodation. In the east, where the defences were weakest, there was an open cistern filled by an aqueduct. It acted both as a moat and water supply for the castle.\nAt the north end of the small courtyard is a chapel and at the southern end is an esplanade. The esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard; the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles. Lining the west of the courtyard is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12th century, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.\n\nChapel\nThe current chapel was probably built to replace the one destroyed by an earthquake in 1170. Only the east end of the original chapel, which housed the apse, and a small part of the south wall survive from the original chapel. The later chapel had a barrel vault and an uncomplicated apse; its design would have been considered outmoded by contemporary standards in France, but bears similarities to that built around 1186 at Margat. It was divided into three roughly equal bays. A cornice runs round the chapel at the point where the vault ends and the wall begins. Oriented roughly east to west, it was 21.5 metres (71 ft) long and 8.5 metres (28 ft) wide with the main entrance from the west and a second smaller one in the north wall. When the castle was remodelled in the early 13th century, the entrance was moved to the south wall. The chapel was lit by windows above the cornice, one at the west end, one on either side of the east bay, and one on the south side of the central bay, and the apse at the east end had a large window. In 1935, a second chapel was discovered outside the castle's main entrance, however it no longer survives.\n\nOuter ward\nThe second phase of building work undertaken by the Hospitallers began in the early 13th century and lasted decades. The outer walls were built in the last major construction on the site, lending the Krak des Chevaliers its current appearance. Standing 9 metres (30 ft) high, the outer circuit had towers that projected strongly from the wall. While the towers of the inner court had a square plan and did not project far beyond the wall, the towers of the 13th-century outer walls were rounded. This design was new and even contemporary Templar castles did not have rounded towers. The technique was developed at Château Gaillard in France by Richard the Lionheart between 1196 and 1198. The extension to the southeast is of lesser quality than the rest of the circuit and was built at an unknown date. Probably around the 1250s, a postern was added to the north wall.\nArrow slits in the walls and towers were distributed to minimise the amount of dead ground around the castle. Machicolations crowned the walls, offering defenders a way to hurl projectiles towards enemies at the foot of the wall. They were so cramped, archers would have had to crouch inside them. The box machicolations were unusual: those at Krak des Chevaliers were more complex that those at Saône or Margat, and there were no comparable features amongst Crusader castles. However, they bore similarities to Muslim work, such as the contemporary defences at the Citadel of Aleppo. It is unclear which side imitated the other, as the date they were added to Krak des Chevaliers is unknown, but it does provide evidence for the diffusion of military ideas between the Muslim and Christian armies. These defences were accessed by a wall-walk known as a chemin de ronde. In the opinion of historian Hugh Kennedy, the defences of the outer wall were \"the most elaborate and developed anywhere in the Latin east ... the whole structure is a brilliantly designed and superbly built fighting machine\".\nWhen the outer walls were built in the 13th century the main entrance was enhanced. A vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast. The corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length, making it an example of a bent entrance. Bent entrances were a Byzantine innovation, but that at Krak des Chevaliers was a particularly complex example. It extended for 137 metres (450 ft), and along its length were murder-holes which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles. Anyone going straight ahead rather than following the hairpin turn would emerge in the area between the castle's two circuits of walls. To access the inner ward, the passage had to be followed round.\n\nFrescoes\nDespite its predominantly military character, the castle is one of the few sites where Crusader art (in the form of frescoes) has been preserved. In 1935, 1955, and 1978, medieval frescoes were discovered within Krak des Chevaliers after later plaster and white-wash had decayed. The frescos were painted on the interior and exterior of the main chapel and the chapel outside the main entrance, which no longer survives. Writing in 1982, historian Jaroslav Folda noted that at the time there had been little investigation of Crusader frescoes that would provide a comparison for the fragmentary remains found at Krak des Chevaliers. Those in the chapel were painted on the masonry from the 1170–1202 rebuild. Mold, smoke, and moisture have made it difficult to preserve the frescoes. The fragmentary nature of the red and blue frescoes inside the chapel makes them difficult to assess. The one on the exterior of the chapel depicted the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple.\n\nSee also\nList of castles in Syria\nList of Crusader castles\nList of World Heritage in Danger\nCastle of Saladin (Sahyun Castle)\n\nReferences\nWorks cited\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\nKrak des Chevaliers photos and information\nUNESCO Crac des Chevaliers",
          "summary": "Krak des Chevaliers (French: [kʁak de ʃ(ə)valje]; Arabic: قلعة الحصن, romanized: Qalʿat al-Ḥiṣn, Arabic: [ˈqalʕat alˈħisˤn]; Old French: Crac des Chevaliers or Crac de l'Ospital, lit. 'karak [fortress] of the hospital'; from Classical Syriac: ܟܪܟܐ, romanized: karəḵā, lit. 'walled city') is a medieval castle in Syria and one of the most important preserved medieval castles in the world. The site was first inhabited in the 11th century by Kurdish troops garrisoned there by the Mirdasids. In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the order of the Knights Hospitaller. It remained occupied by them until it was reconquered by the Muslims in 1271.\nThe Hospitallers began rebuilding the castle in the 1140s and were finished by 1170 when an earthquake damaged the castle. The order controlled castles along the border of the County of Tripoli, a state founded after the First Crusade. Krak des Chevaliers was among the most important and acted as a center of administration as well as a military base. After a second phase of building was undertaken in the 13th century, Krak des Chevaliers became a concentric castle. This phase created the outer wall and gave the castle its current appearance. The first half of the century has been described as Krak des Chevaliers' \"golden age\". At its peak, Krak des Chevaliers housed a garrison of around 2,000. Such a large garrison allowed the Hospitallers to exact tribute from a wide area. From the 1250s the fortunes of the Knights Hospitaller took a turn for the worse and in 1271 the Mamluk Sultanate captured Krak des Chevaliers after a siege lasting 36 days, supposedly by way of a forged letter purportedly from the Hospitallers' Grand Master that caused the knights to surrender.\nRenewed interest in Crusader castles in the 19th century led to the investigation of Krak des Chevaliers, and architectural plans were drawn up. In the late 19th or early 20th century a settlement had been created within the castle, causing damage to its fabric. The 500 inhabitants were moved in 1933 and the castle was given over to the French Alawite State, which carried out a program of clearing and restoration. When Syria declared independence in 1946, it assumed control.\nToday, the village of al-Husn exists around the castle and has a population of nearly 9,000. Krak des Chevaliers is approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) west of the city of Homs, close to the border of Lebanon, and is administratively part of the Homs Governorate. Since 2006, the castles of Krak des Chevaliers and Qal'at Salah El-Din have been recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. It was partially damaged in the Syrian civil war from shelling and recaptured by the Syrian government forces in 2014. Since then, reconstruction and conservation work on the site had begun. Reports by UNESCO and the Syrian government on the state of the site are produced yearly.",

          "content": "The Citadel of Cairo or Citadel of Saladin (Arabic: قلعة صلاح الدين, romanized: Qalaʿat Salāḥ ad-Dīn) is a medieval Islamic-era fortification in Cairo, Egypt, built by Salah ad-Din (Saladin) and further developed by subsequent Egyptian rulers. It was the seat of government in Egypt and the residence of its rulers for nearly 700 years from the 13th century until the construction of Abdeen Palace in the 19th century. Its location on a promontory of the Mokattam hills near the center of Cairo commands a strategic position overlooking the city and dominating its skyline. When it was constructed it was among the most impressive and ambitious military fortification projects of its time. It is now a preserved historic site, including mosques and museums.\nIn addition to the initial Ayyubid-era construction begun by Saladin in 1176, the Citadel underwent major development during the Mamluk Sultanate that followed, culminating with the construction projects of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad in the 14th century. In the first half of the 19th century Muhammad Ali Pasha demolished many of the older buildings and built new palaces and monuments all across the site, giving it much of its present form. In the 20th century it was used as a military garrison by the British occupation and then by the Egyptian Army until being opened to the public in 1983. In 1979, it was proclaimed by UNESCO as a part of the World Heritage Site Historic Cairo (Islamic Cairo) which was \"the new centre of the Islamic world, reaching its golden age in the 14th century.\"\n\nHistory\nOverview\nThe Citadel was built on a promontory beneath the Muqattam Hills, a setting that made it difficult to attack. The efficacy of the Citadel's location is further demonstrated by the fact that it remained the heart of Egyptian government until the 19th century. During this long period, the layout and structure of the Citadel was repeatedly altered and adapted to suit the designs of new rulers and new regimes, which makes it difficult to reconstitute its original plan or even its plan in subsequent periods. There have been three major construction periods leading to the Citadel's current form: 12th-century Ayyubid (starting with Saladin), 14th-century Mamluk (under al-Nasir Muhammad), and in the 19th century under Muhammad Ali. The Citadel stopped being the seat of government when Egypt's ruler, Khedive Ismail, moved to his newly built Abdin Palace in the new downtown Cairo in 1874. Despite its elaborate defenses, the Citadel never ended up being subjected to a true siege, though it was implicated on various occasions in the political conflicts within Cairo or Egypt.\n\nGeneral layout\nIn general, the fortress complex is divided into two parts: the Northern Enclosure (where the National Military Museum is located today), and the Southern Enclosure (where the Mosque of Muhammad Ali is located today). The Northern Enclosure was historically reserved for military garrisons, while the Southern Enclosure was developed as the residence of the sultan. There is also a lower, western enclosure which was historically the site of the royal stables of the Mamluks. However, these functional distinctions were largely erased in the 19th century under Muhammad Ali Pasha, who overhauled the entire site and constructed buildings of various functions throughout the Citadel.\nTo the west and southwest of the Citadel was a long open field frequently referred to as the \"hippodrome\" by historians or as the Maydan (\"plaza\" or \"square\"). For centuries this was maintained as a training ground (especially for horsemanship) and as a military parade ground. Its outline is still visible in the layout of the roads (mainly Salah ad-Din Street) on this side of the Citadel.\nAt the northern end of this hippodrome was another square or plaza known as Rumayla Square (Maydan/Midan Rumayla), today known as Salah al-Din Square (Midan Salah ad-Din) or Citadel Square (Midan al-Qal'a). This was used as a horse market (due to its adjacency to the royal stables), but also as an official square for royal and religious ceremonies. It is occupied today by a large roundabout next to which are the massive mosques of Sultan Hassan and al-Rifa'i.\n\nAyyubid foundation and construction: 12th–13th centuries\nSaladin's original construction\nThe Citadel was begun by the Kurdish Ayyubid ruler Salah al-Din (Saladin) between 1176 and 1183 CE in order to protect Cairo from potential Crusader attacks and to provide a secure center of government for his new regime (only a few years after he had dismantled the Fatimid Caliphate). This also emulated a feature of many Syrian cities, such as Damascus and Aleppo, which had walled citadels that acted as the seat of power and which Saladin was familiar with. Saladin also set out to build a wall, around 20 kilometres long, that would surround both Cairo and Fustat (the nearby former capital), and is recorded as saying: \"With a wall I will make the two [cities of Cairo and Fustat] into a unique whole, so that one army may defend them both; and I believe it is good to encircle them with a single wall from the bank of the Nile to the bank of the Nile.\" The Citadel would be the centerpiece of the wall. While the Citadel was initially completed in 1183–1184, the wall Saladin had envisioned was still under construction in 1238, long after his death. It does not appear to have ever been fully completed after this, though long segments were built.\nSaladin charged his chief eunuch and close confidant, Baha al-Din Qaraqush, with overseeing the construction of the new fortifications. Most of the structure was built with limestone quarried from the surrounding Muqattam Hills; however, Qaraqush also quarried a number of minor pyramids at Giza and even as far away as Abusir in order to obtain further materials. He also made use of labour provided by Christian prisoners of war captured in Saladin's victories against the Crusaders. The initial fortress built in Saladin's time consisted essentially of what is today's Northern Enclosure, although not all elements of the Northern Enclosure's current walls are original. The southeast and northeast sections of these walls are likely the closest to their original forms. Also from Saladin's time is the so-called Yusuf's Well, a deep underground well accessed through a spiral staircase which provided water for the fortress. The original southwestern section of Saladin's enclosure has disappeared but is likely to have extended around this well and around the current site of al-Nasir Muhammad's mosque (making the original enclosure slightly bigger than the existing Northern Enclosure today). The carved image of a double-headed eagle, found near the top of one of the towers of the western walls (near the Police Museum), is a curious feature which is popularly attributed to Salah ad-Din's reign. It was probably located elsewhere originally and then moved here at some point when the walls were rebuilt in Muhammad Ali's time. The eagle's heads are missing today, but their original appearance was noted by chroniclers.\nOnly one original gate, Bab al-Mudarraj, has survived to the present day. It is located along the walls of the Northern Enclosure, nowadays between the Harem Palace (National Military Museum) and the newer Bab al-Jadid gate. It was originally the main gate of the Citadel, but today it is obscured by later constructions from Muhammad Ali's time, including the Bab al-Jadid (\"New Gate\"). Its name was derived from the carved stone steps (darraj) which led up to it from the path that connected the Citadel to the city below. Like other gateways in Ayyubid military architecture, it had a bent entrance. Today, the inside of the gate's dome-vault is covered in plaster with painted inscriptions belonging to Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad and dated to 1310. It was also on this gate that a foundation inscription was discovered which dates the completion of the Citadel to 1183–1184. Nonetheless, construction of one kind or another almost certainly continued under Saladin's Ayyubid successors.\n\nConstruction under Saladin's successors\nConstruction of the Ayyubid Citadel appears to have continued under Sultan al-'Adil (r. 1200–1218), Saladin's brother and later successor, and was probably finished under the reign of al-Kamil (1218–1238). Al-'Adil had already supervised some of the construction under Saladin, while al-Kamil in turn probably worked on the Citadel during al-'Adil's reign when the latter gave him the viceroyship of Egypt in 1200 (a prelude to becoming sultan later). The rounded towers in the outer walls of the Northern Enclosure date from Saladin's initial construction while the large rectangular towers date to al-Adil's reign. The two large round towers in the far northeastern corner of the enclosure, known as Burj al-Ramla (\"Tower of Sand\") and Burj al-Hadid (\"Tower of Iron\") are towers from Saladin's time which al-Kamil subsequently reinforced in 1207.\nMore significantly, al-Kamil built or completed the palaces in the southern section of the Citadel, and became the first ruler to actually move there in 1206. In addition to the palaces, a number of other structures were built, including a mosque, a royal library, and a \"hall of justice\". In 1213 al-Kamil also established a horse market on what became Rumayla Square (the square between the Citadel and Sultan Hasan's mosque today), as well as a maydan, a long open square or \"hippodrome\", to the west and south of the Citadel which was used for equestrian training and military parades. This was on the same site that Ahmad Ibn Tulun established a similar hippodrome in the 9th century. This work established the overall plan of the Citadel area for centuries to come: the northern part of the citadel was devoted to military functions, the southern part to the sultan's private residence and the state administration, and outside, at the southwestern foot of the Citadel, was the parade ground which remained for centuries. Al-Kamil was likely also responsible for building or completing the first water aqueduct which ran along the top of Saladin's city walls to the southwest and brought water from the Nile to the Citadel.\nSultan al-Salih (r. 1240–1249) subsequently moved away from the Citadel again and built himself a new fortified enclosure on Roda Island (which also became the barracks of the Bahri Mamluks who took power after him). Only under the Mamluks, who ruled from 1250 to 1517, did the Citadel finally become the permanent residence of the sultans.\n\nMamluk period: 13th–16th centuries\nEarly Bahri Mamluk period\nUnder the early Bahri Mamluks, the Citadel was continuously developed and the Southern Enclosure in particular was expanded and became the site of important monumental structures. Al-Zahir Baybars, al-Mansur Qalawun, al-Ashraf Khalil and al-Nasir Muhammad each built or rebuilt the audience hall (throne hall), the main mosque, the palaces, or other structures. Unlike the earlier Ayyubid buildings, the Mamluk buildings were increasingly designed to be visible from afar and to dominate the city's skyline. Many of these structures have not survived, with few exceptions.\nBaybars (r. 1260–1277) was the first one to split the Citadel into two areas by building the Bab al-Qulla, the gate and wall which today separates the Southern and Northern Enclosures of the Citadel. It was named after a keep tower which he built nearby and which was later torn down by Qalawun. The gate itself was rebuilt again by al-Nasir Muhammad in 1320. The gate was intended to control access to the newly delimited Southern Enclosure which Baybars then developed into a more elaborate and more exclusive royal complex. A part of the Southern Enclosure became reserved for the harem, the private and domestic area of the sultan and his family, while another part became the site of more monumental structures whose functions were more public, ceremonial, or administrative. Among the structures he built here was one called the Dar al-Dhahab (\"the Hall of Gold\"), which he seems to have used as his private reception hall and which may have been located in the area of the present Police Museum. Another important structure he built in the area is referred to as the Qubba al-Zahiriyya (\"the Dome of al-Zahir\"), a monumental and richly decorated hall with a central dome which acted as an audience hall or throne hall. It may have been a new structure or an addition to an existing Ayyubid structure, and it was probably the predecessor of al-Nasir Muhammad's \"Great Iwan\". Baybars also built the Tower of the Lions (Burj al Siba'), a round tower which featured a stone-carved frieze of lions (Baybars' emblem) along its upper parts. The tower was obscured by later construction but its remains, including the lion carvings, were rediscovered in the late 20th century and are now visible on the northwestern side of the Police Museum.\nSultan al-Mansur Qalawun (r. 1279–1290) either built or significantly renovated a structure known as the Dar al-Niyaba which served as the palace of the sultan's vice-regent. He also demolished Baybars' Qubba al-Zahiriyya and replaced it with his own domed structure, the Qubba al-Mansuriyya. More significantly in the long run, Qalawun was the first to create elite regiments of mamluks (soldiers of slave origin) who resided in the various towers of the Citadel, which earned them the name \"Burji\" Mamluks (Mamluks of the Tower). It was these cohorts of mamluks who would eventually dominate the sultanate during the Burji Mamluk period.\nSultan al-Ashraf Khalil built a qa'a (reception hall) in 1291–1292, referred to as the Qa'a al-Ashrafiyya. Its remains were excavated in the late 20th century and are still visible today, just west of the present-day gate called Bab al-'Alam (Gate of the Flag), across the terrace from the current Police Museum. The remains indicate that the walls of the hall were decorated with multi-coloured marble paneling along the lower walls (a dado), above which was a small frieze of marble mosaics with mother-of-pearl and other marble reliefs, and above all this were panels of glass mosaics with scenes of trees and palaces which are reminiscent of the mosaics of the Ummayyad Mosque and Mausoleum of Baybars in Damascus. (During excavations the mosaics were removed for study and restoration.) The hall also had a central octagonal fountain of marble and the floor was paved with marble mosaics arranged in geometric patterns. It was one of the few structures in this area which al-Nasir Muhammad did not destroy but instead re-used for various purposes, and in the Burji Mamluk period it seems to have replaced the Dar al-Niyaba as the palace of the vice-regent. Al-Ashraf also, once again, demolished the qubba or domed throne hall of his father Qalawun and replaced it with his own structure, the Iwan al-Ashrafiyya (the word \"iwan\" seems to have been used from then on for this particular type of building). This new throne hall differed from previous incarnations in one notable respect: it was painted with pictures of al-Ashraf's amirs (commanders), each with their rank inscribed above his head.\n\nThe reign of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad\nThe greatest builder of the Citadel during the Mamluk period was al-Nasir Muhammad, another son of Qalawun, who was sultan three times over a period of nearly fifty years between 1293 and 1341. It was most likely under his reign that the borders of the Southern Enclosure expanded to their current outline, in order to accommodate the new palaces and structures he built. He is responsible for several major works in the Citadel, though unfortunately most of them fell into ruin during the Ottoman period and were finally demolished by Muhammad Ali in the 19th century. In addition to his official palaces and his semi-public monuments in the Southern Enclosure, al-Nasir reserved the southeastern corner of the enclosure (the location of the al-Gawhara Palace today) for the palaces, private courtyard, and garden devoted to his harem (wives and concubines), probably as Baybars had done, called al-Qusur al-Jawwaniyya. He also commissioned new palaces outside the Citadel but nearby for his favourite amirs, and his projects encouraged the development of areas near the Citadel, such as al-Darb al-Ahmar.\nIn 1312 al-Nasir also ordered the renovation of the water aqueduct which brought water from the Nile to the Citadel. His predecessor, al-Ashraf, is responsible for building an octagonal water intake tower on the shores of the Nile, from which water was raised and transferred along the aqueduct, but al-Nasir completed the project. This improvement of the infrastructure allowed him in turn to embark on more ambitious projects within the Citadel.\n\nThe Ablaq Palace (Qasr al-Ablaq)\nAmong the most important constructions was the Ablaq Palace (Qasr al-Ablaq; sometimes translated as the \"Striped Palace\"), built in 1313–1314. Its name derived from the red-and-black ablaq masonry that marked its exterior. It may have been partly inspired by the palace of the same name that Sultan Baybars had built in Damascus in 1264 and in which al-Nasir resided when he visited that city. The palace was used for regular receptions and private ceremonies. It was connected to the Great Iwan (see below) by a private passage or corridor which led to the sultan's entrance in the back wall of the Iwan. The walls of the palace itself formed a part of the new outer boundary of the Citadel's enclosure: it was located on an escarpment overlooking the city below, and the escarpment, along with the foundation walls of the palace, acted as the effective outer wall of the Citadel at its western corner. Because of this, al-Nasir was able to build a loggia on the side of the palace from which he could freely observe the activities in the stables and in the maydan (hippodrome) at the foot of the Citadel below, as well as a private door and staircase which gave him direct access between the palace and the hippodrome.\n\nThe Great Iwan (al-Iwan al-Kabir)\nAl-Nasir demolished, yet again, the Iwan al-Ashrafiyya (throne hall) of his brother al-Ashraf in 1311, and replaced it with his own structure known as the Great Iwan (al-Iwan al-Kabir). This may have been out of a desire to make it appear even more prominent and monumental, as well as to perhaps accommodate larger ceremonies. In any case, he demolished it (either entirely or in part) and rebuilt it yet again in 1333, and it is this incarnation of the Great Iwan which survived up until the 19th century (when it was destroyed during Muhammad Ali's constructions). It was frequently cited by chroniclers as the most impressive structure in Cairo, more monumental than almost any of the Mamluk mosques. It served as the sultan's public and ceremonial throne room and continued to be used (albeit less consistently) by Mamluk sultans after him.\n\nAl-Nasir Muhammad's Mosque\nLastly, al-Nasir's other most notable contribution, and the only major structure of his reign still preserved at the Citadel, was the Mosque of al-Nasir, also situated in the Southern Enclosure. This was built in 1318 on the site of an earlier Ayyubid main mosque which he demolished in order to serve as the new grand mosque of the Citadel. Al-Nasir renovated his mosque again in 1335. Some of its huge columns were also re-used from Pharaonic-era buildings, much like the columns of the Great Iwan. While its structure is well preserved, most of its rich marble paneling decoration was stripped away and shipped to Istanbul by the Ottoman sultan Selim I after his conquest of Egypt.\n\nLater Mamluk period\nSubsequent sultans continued to build or add to the palaces and administrative buildings inside the Citadel, though rarely with the same ambition as al-Nasir Muhammad. Sultan al-Salih Isma'il (a son of al-Nasir who reigned from 1342 to 1345) built a richly decorated palace or hall known as al-Duhaysha (the \"little wonder\") which was inaugurated in February 1344. Likewise, Sultan Hasan (another son of al-Nasir) built a lavish domed palace known as the Qa'a al-Baysariyya, which was completed in 1360. It was over 50 metres tall and, in addition to a main hall covered by a dome, it also had a tower with an apartment for the sultan which was decorated with ivory and ebony. Other private apartments also had domes, while paintings and portraits decorated the walls. Both Isma'il and Hasan were sons of al-Nasir Muhammad. Sultan Hasan also built his massive madrasa-mosque just northwest of the Citadel, off Rumayla Square, in the 1350s and early 1360s (and still standing today). It was so large and tall that in later years it was reportedly used by rebels as a platform from which to bombard the Citadel on more than one occasion.\nThe Burji Mamluk period saw little construction in the Citadel by comparison with the earlier Mamluk period. The private harem courtyard in the southeastern corner of the Southern Enclosure, known as the hosh, became increasingly used to build new reception halls and other structures with slightly more public functions. The late Burji sultans Qaytbay and al-Ghuri built palaces in this part of the Citadel, on the site of what is now the 19th-century al-Gawhara Palace. Al-Ghuri also restored many other structures in and around the Citadel, including a major restoration/reconstruction of the Citadel's Nile aqueduct. He also restored or reconfigured the Mamluk hippodrome at the southwestern foot of the Citadel, where he installed a vast pool which received water from the restored aqueduct.\n\nOttoman period: 16th–18th centuries\nEgypt was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1517 and remained under Ottoman rule for centuries. Sultan Selim I stripped the monumental Mamluk buildings of their precious materials, especially their marble panels and decoration, and shipped them to Istanbul for use in his own building projects.\nDuring this period the Citadel was neglected and many Mamluk structures fell into ruin, although some of the Citadel walls were rebuilt or extended in the 16th–17th centuries. Due to rivalries between different military corps in the Ottoman forces, the Citadel was divided into three areas to house three different elements of the Ottoman garrison: the Northern Enclosure housed the barracks of the Janissaries, the Southern Enclosure was used by the Ottoman pasha (governor) and his own troops, and another lower western enclosure, which contained the stables, housed the 'Azaban (or Azap) corps. Each section had its own mosque and facilities. In between them was a virtual no-man's-land where some of the former grand Mamluk buildings stood abandoned or under-used. This included the Great Iwan of al-Nasir Muhammad, whose large dome collapsed in 1521 and was never rebuilt. The Ablaq Palace was used more productively as a manufacturing center for weaving the Kiswah, the rich cloth covering the Kaaba in Mecca, which continued to come from Cairo until the 20th century.\nSome notable structures were still created during this period. The huge round tower near the visitor entrance today, standing at the corner of the Southern and Northern Enclosures, was built by Ibrahim Pasha (the later Grand Vizier under Suleiman the Magnificent) in 1525 and is known as the Burj al-Muqattam (\"Tower of the Muqattam Hills\"). The round tower at the other corner of the two enclosures (between Bab al-Qulla and Bab al-Wastani), known now as Burj al-Wastani (\"Middle Tower\"), may also date from this time. The first mosque built in the Citadel after the Mamluk period was the Mosque of Sulayman Pasha in the Northern Enclosure, built by the Ottoman governor in 1528 for use by the Janissaries. It is one of the few mosques in Cairo that represents something close to the classical Ottoman architectural style.\n\nThe lower, western enclosure which can be seen today below the Mosque of Muhammad Ali was historically the area which housed the stables of the Citadel. It's not clear when walls were first built around it, though they were likely already enclosed in Mamluk times. This enclosure was occupied by the 'Azaban soldiers, and contains the Mosque of al-'Azab which was built by Ahmad Katkhuda in 1697. (It is possible that Ahmad Katkhuda merely renovated an existing early Burji Mamluk mosque and added the present-day Ottoman-style minaret to it.) The rest of the area is presently occupied by various 19th-century buildings, including storehouses and old factories. The lower enclosure was accessed from the west through the monumental gate called Bab al-'Azab, which was built by Radwan Katkhuda al-Julfi in 1754, probably on the site of an earlier Mamluk gate known as Bab al-Istabl (Gate of the Stables). The gate was modeled on the old Fatimid gate of Bab al-Futuh in the north of Cairo, but its interior facade was later remodeled into a neo-Gothic style during the Khedival period.\nThe present-dat visitor entrance goes through the small western gate called Bab al-Jabal (\"Gate of the Mountain\") which was built by the Ottoman governor Yakan Pasha in 1785 when he rearranged the area to build a new palace. Yakan also rebuilt a small stretch of the adjoining wall south of here.\n\nMuhammad Ali: 19th-century\nMuhammad Ali was a pasha of Albanian origin who was appointed by the Ottoman sultan in 1805 to restore order after the French occupation of Egypt (1798–1801). However, he subsequently established himself as de facto independent ruler of the country. He consolidated power through a famous and violent coup in 1811 which eliminated the remaining Mamluk class that still formed the country's elites. One of the most pivotal events of this coup took place in the Citadel. Muhammad Ali invited the Mamluk leaders to a celebration banquet in the Citadel, and as they were leaving and passing along the road leading from the upper Citadel to Bab al-Azab, regiments of his Albanian gunmen opened fire from above and massacred all of them.\nThe Citadel is sometimes referred to as the \"Citadel of Muhammad Ali\" (Arabic: قلعة محمد علي Qalaʿat Muḥammad ʿAlī). It contains the Mosque of Muhammad Ali, which he built between 1828 and 1848, perched on the summit of the citadel. This Ottoman-style mosque was built in memory of Tusun Pasha, Muhammad Ali's second son who died in 1816. However, it also represents Muhammad Ali's efforts to erase symbols of the Mamluk legacy that he sought to replace. Many of the former Mamluk structures, including the Great Iwan and the Ablaq Palace of al-Nasir Muhammad, were demolished in 1825 to make way for his new mosque and its renovated surroundings. Muhammad Ali himself was eventually buried in the mosque. His mosque also replaced the nearby Mosque of al-Nasir Muhammad as the Citadel's official main mosque. Muhammad Ali's mosque, with its large dome and tall pencil-like Ottoman minarets, is one of the most prominent monuments on Cairo's skyline to this day.\n\nAnother obvious change that Muhammad Ali enacted pertained to the uses of the Citadel's northern and southern enclosures: during the Mamluk period the Southern Enclosure was the royal residential area and the Northern Enclosure was mostly military, but Muhammad Ali built his Harem Palace (which now houses the National Military Museum) in the Northern Enclosure, erasing the old functional division between the two sections of the Citadel. He also built or rebuilt some of the walls. Notably, he rebuilt the Bab al-Qulla gate and the surrounding wall which separated the Northern and Southern enclosures from each other, giving it its current look. The gate's form today once again emulates the appearance of Bab al-Futuh but introduces some Turkish elements. In 1825 he also built the gate known as Bab al-Jadid (the \"New Gate\") at the point where a new carriage road entered the Citadel from the north. Around the same time he built the Bab al-Wastani (or Bab al-Wustani) (\"Middle Gate\") where the same road continues into the Southern Enclosure (just north of the Bab al-Qulla).\nThe Citadel eventually ceased to act as the residence of Egypt's ruler after Khedive Isma'il (Muhammad Ali's grandson) moved the court to the new 'Abdin Palace, located in the newly created districts of downtown Cairo, in 1874.\n\n20th century and present day\nFor many years up to the late 20th century, the Citadel was closed to the public and used as a military garrison and base; at first by the British Army during the British occupation and afterward up to 1946, and since then by the Egyptian military. In 1983, the Egyptian government opened a large part of the Citadel to the public and initiated refurbishment programs to convert some of its old buildings into museums, though the military retains a presence. It is now a major tourist site for both Egyptians and foreigners alike.\n\nWater supply system\nYusuf's Well (Salah ad-Din's Well)\nTo supply water to the Citadel, Saladin built an 85-metre-deep (280 ft) well known as the Well of Joseph (or Bir Yusuf), so-called because Saladin's birth name, Yūsif, is the Arabic equivalent of Joseph. His chief eunuch and confidant, Qaraqush, who oversaw construction of the Citadel, was also responsible for digging the well. The well is considered a masterpiece of medieval engineering and still exists today. Its shaft was divided into two sections, almost all of which is cut out of the rock itself. The upper part has a wider shaft which is surrounded by a long spiral staircase, separated from the main shaft only by a thin wall of rock. For this reason, the well is also known as the Spiral Well (Bir al-Halazon). The stairs could be covered with earth to make it into a ramp for oxen to travel down to its bottom. The lower part of the well was another shaft descending to the level of underground water seeping in from the Nile. At the bottom of the upper section, two oxen turned a waterwheel that brought the water up from the bottom of the well, while another waterwheel at the top of the well, also powered by oxen, brought the water up the rest of the way.\n\nThe Mamluk Aqueduct\nDuring the reign of al-Nasir Muhammad, Saladin's well was insufficient to produce enough water for the Citadel's growing population and for al-Nasir's envisioned construction projects. To increase the volume of water, al-Nasir renovated an Ayyubid aqueduct system (probably originally completed by al-Kamil) and extended it with a new aqueduct system. This system consisted of a number of water wheels on the Nile which raised water to the top of an hexagonal tower (built by his predecessor al-Ashraf Khalil), from which the water was then transported along a series of raised aqueducts to the base of the Citadel. From the foot of the Citadel, the water was then carried up to the palaces via another system of waterwheels. However, since this water supply could not be guaranteed in the event of a siege, Saladin's well was still an essential water source.\n\nThe Cistern of Ya'qub Shah al-Mihmandar\nThis small domed building just outside the Citadel to the east was built in 1495–96 by an amir called Ya'qub Shah al-Mihmandar, a man originally from Erzincan (Turkey) who joined the Mamluk ranks under Sultan Qaytbay. Because of its dome, the building has the look of a mausoleum but it is actually a structure covering access to a cistern. It has an inscription that memorializes the victory of Sultan Qaytbay's army over Ottoman forces at Adana in a battle in 1486. Today it is cut off from the Citadel and stands stranded between two highways (Salah Salem road and Kobri al-Ebageah) which pass right next to the Citadel on its eastern side.\n\nMosques\nThere are four main mosques in the Citadel today, some of which are open to visitors:\n\nMosque of Muhammad Ali\nThe mosque was built between 1830 and 1848, although not completed until the reign of Said Pasha in 1857. It is located in the Southern Enclosure and is open to the public today. The architect was Yusuf Bushnak from Istanbul and its model was the Sultan Ahmed Mosque in that city. Muhammad Ali Pasha was buried in a tomb carved from Carrara marble, in the courtyard of the mosque. His body was transferred here from Hawsh al-Basha in 1857.\n\nAl-Nasir Muhammad Mosque\nBuilt in 1318, during the early Bahri Mamluk period, as the royal mosque of the Citadel where the sultans of Cairo performed their Friday prayers, today this hypostyle mosque is still similar to how it looked in the 1300s though many repairs have been made and only some of its original decoration has been restored. The parts of the building relying on plastered walls have been reinforced. There have also been attempts to restore the light-blue color of the ceiling. It is located in the Southern Enclosure and is open to the public.\n\nMosque of Sulayman Pasha\nBuilt in 1528, it was first of the Citadel's Ottoman-style mosques and is one of the few structures in Cairo closely resembling the \"classical\" Ottoman style of the 16th century. It is located in the Northern Enclosure, just northeast of the Harim Palace (Military Museum). It was built on the ruins of the earlier Mosque of Sidi Sariyya built by Abu-Mansur Qasta, an amir in the Fatimid era (predating the Citadel). Qasta's tomb, dated to 1140 CE, still exists in the mosque today.\n\nMosque of al-'Azab\nThis lesser-known mosque is situated right behind the main western gate, Bab al-'Azab. Both are named after the Ottoman military regiments known as 'Azaban (or Azaps) who were housed in this part of the Citadel during the Ottoman period. The mosque was built by the Mamluk amir Ahmad Katkhuda in 1697, but it has been argued that it incorporates, or was a renovation of, an earlier Mamluk mosque or religious structure. Although not publicly accessible, it can be spotted by its pointed Ottoman-style minaret.\n\nMuseums\nThe Citadel also contains several museums:\n\nEgyptian Military museum\nThe official museum of the Egyptian Army. The museum was established in 1937 at the old building of the Egyptian Ministry of War in downtown Cairo. It was later moved to a temporary location in the Garden City district of Cairo. In November 1949 the museum was moved to the Harem Palace at the Cairo citadel. It has been renovated several times since, in 1982 and 1993.\n\nAl-Gawhara Palace Museum\nAlso known as Bijou Palace, is a palace and museum commissioned by Muhammad Ali Pasha in 1814. The palace was designed and constructed by artisans contracted from a variety of countries, including Greeks, Turks, Bulgarians and Albanians. Muhammad Ali's official divan or audience hall, where the pasha received guests, contains a 1,000 kg chandelier sent to him by Louis Philippe I of France. The palace also contains the throne of Muhammad Ali Pasha that was a gift from the King of Italy.\n\nCarriage Museum\nInaugurated in 1983, it houses a collection of unique Royal Carriages attributed to different historical periods, from the reign of Khedive Ismail until the reign of King Farouk, in addition to other collection of unique antiques related to the carriages.\n\nPolice Museum\nThe museum (also sometimes referred to as the Prison Museum) is just north of the gate known as Bab al-'Alam, on a terrace commanding sweeping views of the city below. It is housed in the Citadel's former prison and contains exhibits on topics such as famous political assassinations and displays of the murder weapon used.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCairo Citadel (Arabic)\nQal'a (Citadel) at ArchNet",
          "summary": "The Citadel of Cairo or Citadel of Saladin (Arabic: قلعة صلاح الدين, romanized: Qalaʿat Salāḥ ad-Dīn) is a medieval Islamic-era fortification in Cairo, Egypt, built by Salah ad-Din (Saladin) and further developed by subsequent Egyptian rulers. It was the seat of government in Egypt and the residence of its rulers for nearly 700 years from the 13th century until the construction of Abdeen Palace in the 19th century. Its location on a promontory of the Mokattam hills near the center of Cairo commands a strategic position overlooking the city and dominating its skyline. When it was constructed it was among the most impressive and ambitious military fortification projects of its time. It is now a preserved historic site, including mosques and museums.\nIn addition to the initial Ayyubid-era construction begun by Saladin in 1176, the Citadel underwent major development during the Mamluk Sultanate that followed, culminating with the construction projects of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad in the 14th century. In the first half of the 19th century Muhammad Ali Pasha demolished many of the older buildings and built new palaces and monuments all across the site, giving it much of its present form. In the 20th century it was used as a military garrison by the British occupation and then by the Egyptian Army until being opened to the public in 1983. In 1979, it was proclaimed by UNESCO as a part of the World Heritage Site Historic Cairo (Islamic Cairo) which was \"the new centre of the Islamic world, reaching its golden age in the 14th century.\"",

          "content": "The Norias of Hama (Arabic: نواعير حماة) are a series of 17 norias, historic water-raising machines for irrigation, along the Orontes River in the city of Hama, Syria. They are tall water wheels with box-like water collection compartments embedded around their rims. As the river flows, it pushes these water collection boxes under water, where they quickly fill up, then are driven up to the top of the wheel where they empty into an aqueduct. The aqueduct can carry the water to supply buildings, gardens and farmland.\nSeventeen of Hama's original norias have been conserved. They are notable for their medieval origins, for their large number and for the enormous size of two of them - for nearly 500 years the tallest waterwheels in the world. In the 21st century Hama's norias no longer provide a water supply but are celebrated as an example of advanced water supply technology in medieval Muslim societies and for the striking sights and sounds which they make as they turn. In 2006 the older of the two gigantic norias, the Noria al-Muhammadiya (1361 CE), was accorded Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark designation by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers as marking a major step forward in technology internationally.\n\nEarly history\nThere are strong grounds for believing that many norias were operating in Hama at least by late 12th century CE. Specific dates are known for the two exceptionally large norias from their inscriptions: Noria al-Muhammadiya created in 1361 CE and Noria al-Ma’muriyya in 1453 CE.\nHowever, it is wholly possible that some norias were operating in Hama some centuries earlier. A 13th century regional historian wrote that norias existed in Hama in the late 9th century CE. Norias were in use near Hama by 350 CE, judging from mosaic and tiles bearing images of norias which have been found at Apamea, a Aramic city, also on the Orontes, 30 miles / 55 km downstream from Hama. These images of norias show a strikingly similar design to those in Hama today.\nIn the mid-7th century CE, the area around Hama was conquered and absorbed into the expanding Muslim Arab state. The latter assiduously mastered new technologies which it encountered - like norias - improved them and expanded their uses. The very first norias in Hama might have been built in the Roman / Byzantine period or they might have been built by the subsequent Muslim society, using the established local design.\nAn obvious reason for building norias at Hama is the Orontes’ lack of gradient combined with the height of its banks, which make this the most practical option for drawing irrigation water from the river.\nDates for these norias’ origins refer to the original noria at a site because, like all functioning historic waterwheels, Hama's norias have been repeatedly repaired and rebuilt over the centuries, since wooden parts continually need replacing. On one estimate, if well maintained, a noria will have undergone complete replacement of its wooden parts every 15 years. In Hama such maintenance of norias is carried out by families of skilled noria carpenters who pass this role down the generations, a practice which has survived until present times.\n\nFeatures of the Hama norias\nThe water wheels\nThe wheels are the ‘undershot’ type, driven by water flowing underneath them and pushing the wheel's paddles. In terms of height, the tallest of the norias is 21 metres (69 feet) in diameter and the smallest is 7 metres (23 feet). At least five of these norias are 17 metres (56 feet) or larger. These wheels are made from different woods for different parts. The massive axles and bearings are walnut wood, while poplar was widely used for other parts of the wheel and pine and oak have also been mentioned. Small wooden water collection compartments are embedded all along the rim of the water wheel in between the paddles with which the river drives the wheel. They are like boxes with half of one side open and with a spout whereby the water pours out at the highest point of rotation (see close-up photo below). Most Hama norias have a water collection box between every pair of paddles. But on some they are more widely spaced, for instance one box between every five paddles. In water-bearing capacity, across different norias the boxes range from 4 to 12 litres (1 to 3 US gallons). The water delivery of Hama's norias ranges between 50,000 and 200,000 litres per hour, depending on a noria's size (13,200 to 52,800 US gallons). Brief descriptions of each of 14 norias in Hama are provided in the report by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers concerning its designation of the Noria al-Muhammadiya as a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark.\n\nThe weirs\nHama's norias are always immediately downstream from a weir, a low dam which ensures that river power is concentrated through a channel leading to the noria's wheel. When river levels are low, all water may flow through the noria channel in the weir; when the river is high, surplus water simply flows over the weir. There are often additional channels in these weirs and sluice gates to fine tune river pressure on the water wheel and hence the speed with which a noria turns. Al Dbiyat's description of the Hama norias contains a diagram which conveys these features clearly. Sometimes two, three or even four norias share the same weir, with one or two norias on each side of the river. This clustering of norias is evident on Al Dbiyat's map of the Hama norias  and to a discerning viewer on satellite view maps of Hama. Sometimes a weir is constructed at an angle to a noria so as to concentrate river power to the maximum on the channel leading to the wheel.\n\nThe aqueducts\nThe norias discharge water into aqueducts built on tall stone arches. To catch the water, each aqueduct has a very short section parallel to the water wheel and the river. This joins at 90 degrees the main section of the aqueduct, which leads away from the river and was sometimes many hundreds of metres long. Some aqueducts receive water from two norias of the same height, one on each side of the short section parallel to the water wheel. Much of the aqueducts’ length has now been demolished and today few aqueducts continue very far.\n\nWater sharing systems\nWhen the norias were being used for irrigation, the aqueducts eventually fed into water channels which each supplied multiple fruit and vegetable gardens. While most Hama norias were owned by wealthy landowners, their costs, maintenance and their water were shared on an orderly collective basis by each noria's water users. Such systems for orderly sharing of water are widely practised in traditional Muslim societies. Gardeners often timeshare the water through quickly adjusting small makeshift dams of stones and rags which direct the flow at branches of water channels.\n\nThe Noria al-Muhammadiya\nThis gigantic wheel is 21 metres (69 feet) in diameter. It was built to supply water to the Great Mosque of Hama one kilometre away (0.63 mile) and it also supplied a public hammam (bath-house) and fountains, houses, and gardens nearby. A construction date of 1361 CE is established by an inscription on its aqueduct, stating year 763 of the Islamic calendar.\nThis noria has 120 water collection boxes embedded in its rim. They raise 200,000 litres of water per hour (52,800 US gallons). The wheel takes one minute to complete a revolution, much longer than smaller norias.\nTo drive a wheel bearing such a weight of water, an extraordinarily long weir at a very acute angle was built to concentrate the power of the river on the base of the wheel. This arrangement can be seen clearly on satellite view maps of Hama.\nFor nearly 500 years, the Noria al-Muhammadiya was the tallest waterwheel in the world. In 1854 it was surpassed by the Laxey Wheel, a mine-pumping waterwheel on the Isle of Man, an island between England and Ireland. The Laxey Wheel is only marginally taller, with a diameter of 22.1 metres (73 feet).\n\nFrom irrigation devices to heritage attractions\nFrom the 1930s to late 1950s Hama's norias were competing with new irrigation pumps driven by petrol or diesel engines. Motorised pumps offered entrepreneurial farmers a means to get extra water to grow more food for expanding populations. A severe blow to the norias came in 1960 with the building of the Rastan dam upstream from Hama. This reduced water levels in the Orontes so that for several months of the year Hama's norias could no longer operate and motorised pumps became the only means for continuous irrigation. Spells of non-use causes the wood in the norias to dry, shrink and crack, which makes maintenance costly. By 1970 the number of norias in use had fallen to eight, from the 20 noted by Danish archaeologists in Hama in the 1930s. Between 1977 and 1981 six norias were restored.\nIn February 1982 the army of Syria's first Baathist dictator, Hafez al-Assad, launched a massive attack on Hama to crush an armed uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood. For three weeks the city was bombed by aeroplanes, shelled by artillery and tanks, and finally large areas were demolished with dynamite and bulldozers. Many thousands of Hama citizens were killed. Heritage buildings like Hama's Great Mosque were levelled to the ground and large parts of historic Hama were rendered wholly unrecognisable. According to Hafez al-Assad's favoured British biographer, “about a third of the historic inner city was demolished…. The whole of Hama was reshaped on a grand scale”. Concerning impact on Hama's norias, information is scarce because the Assad government firmly discouraged mention of the 1982 events. According to a non-government source, it seems that the wooden norias themselves did not suffer widespread damage and were turning again within months. An important unanswered question is whether it was in 1982 that the norias’ stone aqueducts suffered the extensive demolition which now precludes any useful delivery of water.\n\nThe Assad government selectively rebuilt a limited part of historic Hama, like the Great Mosque, and landscaped or redeveloped the rest. The norias played an important part in the government's promotion of Hama as a tourist destination. The restoration of norias continued, reaching a peak in 1988 when seven norias were restored. The result has been 17 norias which rotate and raise water but cannot deliver it far because their aqueducts are now cut short. They function as a popular heritage attraction, floodlit during events like the Hama Spring Festival when the Orontes flows well and the norias can turn. By day or night they can be visually spectacular, catching light in the curtains of spray dripping from their water-boxes or casting huge rotating shadows. Sound wise, many of Hama's norias emit the powerful groaning, droning or buzzing sounds from their thick wooden axles, which gave norias their name. A time-honoured sport among Hama youths is to ride on moving norias, sometimes diving into the river from the top, as displayed in an on-line video from 2005. Much of the illustration and information now available about Hama's norias derives from these 17 norias during the period between the 1980s and the 2011 Syrian civil war. In 1999 the Syrian government applied to UNESCO for the norias of Hama to be designated a World Heritage Site.\n\nHama’s norias and the Syrian civil war\nHama's norias were largely spared damage during the civil war which began in 2011. Since Hama was famous as a conservative and militant Sunni Muslim city, where hatred of the secular Baathist dictatorship had been intensified by the 1982 massacre, it was an expected focal point for rebellion. Accordingly, the dictatorship of Bashar Assad made strenuous efforts to retain control of Hama from the outset. In July and August 2011 it used massive lethal force against large crowds of demonstrators in Hama. Subsequently, the Assad government retained control of the city so Hama never suffered the air raids which the government inflicted on areas controlled by its opponents.\nMost of Hama's norias have survived. The American Association for the Advancement of Science compared pre-war satellite photos of 10 noria sites in Hama with those from 2014 and concluded that no major damage had occurred. However, one noria was burned deliberately in 2014, some have been pillaged for timber, and others are suffering from lack of maintenance. A mid-2020 article in the on-line English language magazine Arab Weekly interviewed traditional noria craftsmen who were restoring Hama's Noria al-Muhammadiya and also a Hama official responsible for the norias. While local citizen initiatives to revive the norias were underway, it was proving difficult for lack of money for materials and a serious shortage of suitably skilled traditional noria craftsmen, owing to death or emigration during the conflict.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nFurther reading\nDelpech, Annette; Girard, Francois; Robine, Gerard, Roumi, Muhammad (1997) Les Norias de l’Oronte.

          "content": "Ebla (Sumerian: 𒌈𒆷 eb₂-la, Arabic: إبلا, modern: تل مرديخ, Tell Mardikh) was one of the earliest kingdoms in Syria. Its remains constitute a tell located about 55 km (34 mi) southwest of Aleppo near the village of Mardikh. Ebla was an important center throughout the 3rd millennium BC and in the first half of the 2nd millennium BC. Its discovery proved the Levant was a center of ancient, centralized civilization equal to Egypt and Mesopotamia and ruled out the view that the latter two were the only important centers in the Near East during the Early Bronze Age.\n\nStarting as a small settlement in the Early Bronze Age (c. 3500 BC), Ebla developed into a trading empire and later into an expansionist power that imposed its hegemony over much of northern and eastern Syria. Ebla was destroyed during the 23rd century BC. It was then rebuilt and was mentioned in the records of the Third Dynasty of Ur. The second Ebla was a continuation of the first, ruled by a new royal dynasty. It was destroyed at the end of the 3rd millennium BC, which paved the way for the Amorite tribes to settle in the city, forming the third Ebla. The third kingdom also flourished as a trade center; it became a subject and an ally of Yamhad (modern-day Aleppo) until its final destruction by the Hittite king Mursili I in c. 1600 BC.\nEbla maintained its prosperity through a vast trading network. Artifacts from Sumer, Cyprus, Egypt and as far as Afghanistan were recovered from the city's palaces. The kingdom had its own language, Eblaite, and the political organization of Ebla had features different from the Sumerian model. Women enjoyed a special status, and the queen had major influence in the state and religious affairs. The pantheon of gods was mainly north Semitic and included deities exclusive to Ebla. The city was excavated from 1964 and became famous for the Ebla tablets, an archive of about 20,000 cuneiform tablets found there, dated to 2500 BC–2350 BC. Written in both Sumerian and Eblaite and using the cuneiform, the archive has allowed a better understanding of the Sumerian language and provided important information over the political organization and social customs of the mid-3rd millennium BC's Levant.\n\nEtymology\nThe word \"Ebla\" may derive from a word meaning \"white rock\", possibly referring to the limestone outcrop on which the city was built.\n\nHistory\nChalcolithic\nArtifacts from the late Ubaid and late Chalcolithic periods were recovered from the central mound.\n\nEarly Bronze\nEbla was first settled around 3500 BC; its growth was supported by many satellite agricultural settlements. The city benefited from its role as an entrepôt of growing international trade, which probably began with an increased demand for wool in Sumer. Archaeologists designate this early habitation period \"Mardikh I\"; it ended around 3000 BC.\nMardikh I is followed by the first and second kingdoms era between about 3000 and 2000 BC, designated \"Mardikh II\". I. J. Gelb considered Ebla a part of the Kish civilization, which was a cultural entity of East Semitic-speaking populations that stretched from the center of Mesopotamia to the western Levant.\n\nFirst kingdom\nEbla was the most prominent kingdom among the Syrian states during the first kingdom period between about 3000 and 2300 BC, particularly during the second half of the 3rd millennium BC, known as \"the age of the archives\" after the Ebla tablets.\nMardiikh IIA: The early period between 3000 and 2400 BC is designated \"Mardikh IIA\". General knowledge about the city's history prior to the written archives is obtained through excavations. The first stages of Mardikh IIA is identified with building \"CC\", and structures that form a part of building \"G2\", which was apparently a royal palace built c. 2700 BC. Toward the end of this period, a hundred years' war with Mari started. Mari gained the upper hand through the actions of its king Saʿumu, who conquered many of Ebla's cities. In the mid-25th century BC, king Kun-Damu defeated Mari, but the state's power declined following his reign.\n\nMardikh IIB1: The archive period, which is designated \"Mardikh IIB1\", lasted from c. 2400 BC until c. 2300 BC. The end of the period is known as the \"first destruction\", mainly referring to the destruction of the royal palace (called palace \"G\" and built over the earlier \"G2\"), and much of the acropolis. During the archive period, Ebla had political and military dominance over the other Syrian city-states of northern and eastern Syria, which are mentioned in the archives. Most of the tablets, which date from that period, are about economic matters but also include royal letters and diplomatic documents.\n\nThe written archives do not date from before Igrish-Halam's reign, which saw Ebla paying tribute to Mari, and an extensive invasion of Eblaite cities in the middle Euphrates region led by the Mariote king Iblul-Il. Ebla recovered under King Irkab-Damu in about 2340 BC; becoming prosperous and launching a successful counter-offensive against Mari. Irkab-Damu concluded a peace and trading treaty with Abarsal. This Treaty between Ebla and Abarsal is one of the earliest-recorded treaties in history.\n\nGeography\nAt its greatest extent, Ebla controlled an area roughly half the size of modern Syria, from Ursa'um in the north, to the area around Damascus in the south, and from Phoenicia and the coastal mountains in the west, to Haddu in the east. Large parts of the kingdom were under the direct control of the king and were administered by governors; the rest consisted of vassal kingdoms. One of the most important of these vassals was Armi, which is the city most often mentioned in the Ebla tablets. Ebla had more than sixty vassal kingdoms and city-states, including Hazuwan, Burman, Emar, Halabitu and Salbatu.\nAccording to Archi, these are \"the twelve Syrian cities long allied with Ebla that (presumably) assisted in some way during the expedition against Mari: NIrar, Ra’ak, Burman, Dub, Emar, Garmu, Lumnan, Ibubu, Ursaum, Utik, Kakmium, and Iritum (Irridu).\" Furthermore, the following cities were under Ebla's hegemony at that time, and annually delivered tribute: Dub, Dulu, Harran, Ibubu, Iritum, Kablul, Sanapzugum, Ursaum, and Utik.\nModern scholars have termed the king's chief official  \"the vizier\". The most powerful vizier was Ibrium, who campaigned against Abarsal during the term of his predecessor Arrukum. Ibrium held office for 18 years with warfare occurring in all but one year. During the reign of Isar-Damu, Ebla continued the war against Mari, which defeated Ebla's ally Nagar, blocking trade routes between Ebla and southern Mesopotamia via upper Mesopotamia. Ebla conducted regular military campaigns against rebellious vassals, including several attacks on Armi, and a campaign against the southern region of Ib'al – close to Qatna. In order to settle the war with Mari, Isar-Damu allied with Nagar and Kish. Some scholars have suggested that the Kish in question was not the Mesopotamian city but rather a town near Nagar in the Khabur area. The campaign was headed by the Eblaite vizier Ibbi-Sipish, who led the combined armies to victory in a battle near Terqa. The alliance also attacked Armi and occupied it, leaving Ibbi-Sipish's son Enzi-Malik as governor. Ebla suffered its first destruction a few years after the campaign, probably following Isar-Damu's death.\n\nFirst destruction of Ebla\nThe first destruction occurred c. 2300 BC; palace \"G\" was burned, baking the clay tablets of the royal archives and preserving them. Many theories about the cause and the perpetrator have been posited:\n\nHigh (early) dating hypothesis: Giovanni Pettinato supports an early dating for Ebla that would put the destruction at around 2500 BC. Pettinato, while preferring the date of 2500 BC, later accepted the event could have happened in 2400 BC. The scholar suggests the city was destroyed in 2400 BC by a Mesopotamian such as Eannatum of Lagash – who boasted of taking tribute from Mari – or Lugalzagesi of Umma, who claimed to have reached the Mediterranean.\nAkkadian hypothesis: Both kings Sargon of Akkad and his grandson Naram-Sin claimed to have destroyed a town called Ibla, The discoverer of Ebla, Paolo Matthiae, considers Sargon a more likely culprit; his view is supported by Trevor Bryce, but rejected by Michael Astour. The conquest of Armanum and Ebla on the Mediterranean coast by Naram-Sin is mentioned in several of his inscriptions:\n\"Whereas, for all time since the creation of mankind, no king whosoever had destroyed Armanum and Ebla, the god Nergal, by means of (his) weapons opened the way for Naram-Sin, the mighty, and gave him Armanum and Ebla. Further, he gave to him the Amanus, the Cedar Mountain, and the Upper Sea. By means of the weapons of the god Dagan, who magnifies his kingship, Naram-Sin, the mighty, conquered Armanum and Ebla.\"\nMari's revenge: According to Alfonso Archi and Maria Biga, the destruction happened approximately three or four years after the battle at Terqa. Archi and Biga say the destruction was caused by Mari in retaliation for its humiliating defeat at Terqa. This view is supported by Mario Liverani. Archi says the Mariote king Isqi-Mari destroyed Ebla before ascending the throne of his city.\nNatural catastrophe: Astour says a natural catastrophe caused the blaze which ended the archive period. He says the destruction was limited to the area of the royal palace and there is no convincing evidence of looting. He dates the fire to c. 2290 BC (Middle Chronology).\n\nSecond kingdom\nThe second kingdom's period is designated \"Mardikh IIB2\", and spans the period between 2300 and 2000 BC. The second kingdom lasted until Ebla's second destruction, which occurred anytime between 2050 and 1950 BC, with the 2000 BC dating being a mere formal date. The Akkadians under Sargon of Akkad and his descendant Naram-Sin invaded the northern borders of Ebla aiming for the forests of the Amanus Mountain; the intrusions were separated by roughly 90 years and the areas attacked were not attached to Akkad. Archi accept that the Ibla mentioned in the annals of Sargon and Naram-Sin is the Syrian Ebla but do not consider them responsible for the destruction which ended the Archive period. By the time of Naram-Sin, Armi was the hegemonic city in northern Syria and was destroyed by the Akkadian king.\n\nA new local dynasty ruled the second kingdom of Ebla, but there was continuity with its first kingdom heritage. Ebla maintained its earliest features, including its architectural style and the sanctity of the first kingdom's religious sites. A new royal palace was built in the lower town, and the transition from the archive period is marked only by the destruction of palace \"G\". Little is known about the second kingdom because no written material have been discovered aside from one inscription dating to the end of the period.\nThe second kingdom was attested in contemporaneous sources; in an inscription, Gudea of Lagash asked for cedars to be brought from Urshu in the mountains of Ebla, indicating Ebla's territory included Urshu north of Carchemish in modern-day Turkey. Texts that dates to the seventh year of Amar-Sin (c. 2040 BC), a ruler of the Ur III empire, mention a messenger of the Ensí (\"Megum\") of Ebla. The second kingdom was considered a vassal by the Ur III government, but the nature of the relation is unknown and it included the payment of tribute. A formal recognition of Ur's overlordship appears to be a condition for the right of trade with that empire.\nThe second kingdom disintegrated toward the end of the 21st century BC, and ended with the destruction of the city by fire, although evidence for the event has only been found outside of the so-called \"Temple of the Rock\", and in the area around palace \"E\" on the acropolis. Conflict may have preceded the fire; according to Astour, it could have been the result of a Hurrian invasion c. 2030 BC, led by the former Eblaite vassal city of Ikinkalis. The destruction of Ebla is mentioned in the fragmentary Hurro-Hittite legendary epic \"Song of Release\" discovered in 1983, which Astour considers as describing the destruction of the second kingdom. In the epic, an Eblaite assembly led by a man called \"Zazalla\" prevents king Meki from showing mercy to prisoners from Ebla's former vassal Ikinkalis, provoking the wrath of the Hurrian storm god Teshub and causing him to destroy the city.\n\nMiddle Bronze\nThird kingdom\nThe third kingdom is designated \"Mardikh III\"; it is divided into periods \"A\" (c. 2000–1800 BC) and \"B\" (c. 1800–1600 BC). In period \"A\", Ebla was quickly rebuilt as a planned city. The foundations covered the remains of Mardikh II; new palaces and temples were built, and new fortifications were built in two circles – one for the low city and one for the acropolis. The city was laid out on regular lines and large public buildings were built. Further construction took place in period \"B\".\n\nThe first known king of the third kingdom is Ibbit-Lim, who described himself as the Mekim of Ebla. A basalt votive statue bearing Ibbit-Lim's inscription was discovered in 1968; this helped to identify the site of Tell-Mardikh with the ancient kingdom Ebla. The name of the king is Amorite in the view of Pettinato; it is therefore probable the inhabitants of third kingdom Ebla were predominantly Amorites, as were most of the inhabitants of Syria at that time.\nBy the beginning of the 18th century BC, Ebla had become a vassal of Yamhad, an Amorite kingdom centered in Aleppo. Written records are not available for this period, but the city was still a vassal during Yarim-Lim III of Yamhad's reign. One of the known rulers of Ebla during this period was Immeya, who received gifts from the Egyptian Pharaoh Hotepibre, indicating the continuing wide connections and importance of Ebla. The city was mentioned in tablets from the Yamhadite vassal city of Alalakh in modern-day Turkey; an Eblaite princess married a son of King Ammitaqum of Alalakh, who belonged to a branch of the royal Yamhadite dynasty.\nEbla was destroyed by the Hittite King Mursili I in about 1600 BC. Indilimma was probably the last king of Ebla; a seal of his crown prince Maratewari was discovered in the western palace \"Q\". Alternatively, Maratewari  could well be the last king according to Archi, who also argued that the \"Song of Release\" epic describes the destruction of the third kingdom and preserves older elements.\n\nLater periods\nEbla never recovered from its third destruction. It was a small village in the phase designated \"Mardikh IV\" (1600–1200 BC), and was mentioned in the records of Alalakh as a vassal to the Idrimi dynasty. \"Mardikh V\" (1200–535 BC) was a rural, Early Iron Age settlement that grew in size during later periods. Further development occurred during \"Mardikh VI\", which lasted until c. 60 AD. \"Mardikh VII\" began in the 3rd century AD and lasted until the 7th century, after which the site was abandoned.\n\nSite\nLayout\nEbla consisted of a lower town and a raised acropolis in the center. During the first kingdom, the city had an area of 56 hectares and was protected by mud-brick fortifications. Ebla was divided into four districts – each with its own gate in the outer wall. The acropolis included the king's palace \"G\", and one of two temples in city dedicated to Kura (called the \"Red Temple\"). The lower city included the second temple of Kura in the southeast called \"Temple of the Rock\". During the second kingdom, a royal palace (Archaic palace \"P5\") was built in the lower town northwest of the acropolis, in addition to temple \"D\" built over the destroyed \"Red Temple\".\n\nDuring the third kingdom, Ebla was a large city nearly 60 hectares in size, and was protected by a fortified rampart, with double chambered gates. The acropolis was fortified and separated from the lower town. New royal palace \"E\" was built on the acropolis (during Mardikh IIIB), and a temple of Ishtar was constructed over the former \"Red\" and \"D\" temples (in area \"D\"). The lower town was also divided into four districts; palace \"P5\" was used during Mardikh IIIA, and replaced during Mardikh IIIB by the \"Intermediate Palace\".\nOther third kingdom buildings included the vizier palace, the western palace (in area \"Q\"), the temple of Shamash (temple \"N\"), the temple of Rasap (temple \"B1\") and the northern palace (built over the \"Intermediate Palace\"). In the north of the lower town, a second temple for Ishtar was built, while the former \"Temple of the Rock\" was replaced by a temple of Hadad.\n\nRoyal burials\nThe kings of the first kingdom were buried outside the city; the last ten kings (ending with Irkab-Damu) were buried in Darib, while older kings were buried in a royal mausoleum located in Binas and only one royal tomb dating to the first kingdom was discovered in Ebla (Hypogeum \"G4\"). This first kingdom tomb was probably built during the reign of the last king and might be an indication of Eblaite adoption of Mesopotamian traditions to bury the kings beneath their royal palaces.\nThe third kingdom royal necropolis was discovered beneath palace \"Q\" (the western palace); it contains many hypogea but only three were excavated. Those tombs were natural caves in the bedrock of the palace's foundation; they all date to the 19th and 18th centuries BC and had a similar plan consisting of an entrance shaft, burial chambers and a dromos, or entryway, connecting the shaft to the chamber.\n\nHypogeum G4\nThe tomb found in the royal palace \"G\" is designated hypogeum \"G4\"; it dates to the archive period, most probably the reign of Isar-Damu. The tomb is heavily damaged; most of its stones were sacked and nothing of the roof system remains. It also lacks any skeletal remains or funerary goods suggesting that it was either heavily pillaged, never used, or was built as a cenotaph.\nExcavated between 1992 and 1995, it is located underneath the western sector of the palace at a depth of almost 6 meters. The tomb is composed of two rooms opened on each other's with lime plaster floors. Both rooms are rectangular in shape; the eastern room (L.6402) is 4 meters wide, more than 3,5 meters long (total length is unknown due to heavy damage) and west–east oriented. The western room (L.5762) is 5.20 meters long, 4 meters wide and west–east oriented. Limestone was used to build the walls and few blocks protruding from the sides toward the middle of the rooms suggest the roof to have been a corbelled vault.\n\nWestern palace tombs\nThe tombs were found under the floor of Building Q, which was built in the Isin-Larsa period.\n\nThe tomb of the princess: dating to c. 1800 BC, it is the oldest and smallest of the third kingdom tombs found. Excavated in 1978, it contained the remains of a young woman.. The dromos is an enlargement of a natural cave with steps partially cut in the bedrock and partially paved with stones. The tomb is the only one not pillaged; it contained precious jewels and funerary objects.\nThe tomb of the cisterns: this tomb is the most damaged in the necropolis. It consists of a double room burial; the earliest, (Q79A), was built at the same period of the tomb of the princess, and was badly damaged when the tomb was reused, and a dromos was built in the place of Q79A toward the end of the 17th century BC (leading to the founding of burial Q79B). This was probably the resting place of a king; a club (a symbol of royal power) was discovered in Q79A.\nThe tomb of the lord of the goats: the largest in the necropolis, it includes two depositional chambers and is reached through a vertical shaft. The recovered body is not identified; archaeologists call it \"the Lord of the Goats\" after one of the grave goods, a throne decorated with bronze goat heads. It could be king Immeya; a silver cup inscribed with his name was among the grave goods.\n\nGovernment\nThe first kingdom's government consisted of the king (styled Malikum) and the grand vizier, who headed a council of elders (Abbu) and the administration. The second kingdom was also a monarchy, but little is known about it because of a lack of written records. The third kingdom was a city-state monarchy with reduced importance under the authority of Yamhad.\n\nAdministration of the first kingdom\nThe queen shared the running of affairs of state with the king. The crown prince was involved in internal matters and the second prince was involved in foreign affairs. Most duties, including military ones, were handled by the vizier and the administration, which consisted of 13 court dignitaries – each of whom controlled between 400 and 800 men forming a bureaucracy with 11,700 people. Each of the four quarters of the lower city was governed by a chief inspector and many deputies. To oversee royal interest, the king employed agents (mashkim), collectors (ur) and messengers (kas).\n\nAdministrative divisions\nMany client kingdoms owed allegiance to Ebla and each was ruled by its own king (En); those vassal kings were highly autonomous, paying tribute and supplying military assistance to Ebla. The administrative center in the capital was named the \"SA.ZA\"; it included the royal palaces, storerooms and some temples. Regions beyond the walls of the capital were collectively named in Eblaite texts \"uru-bar\" (literally meaning outside of the city). The villages and towns under the central authority were either ruled directly from the capital, or had appointed officials. The titles of the civil servants do not clearly define the bearer's responsibilities and authority as each town had its own political traditions.\n\nLugal: while in Mesopotamia a lugal designated a king, in Ebla it designated a governor who was directly under the authority of the capital. The nature of this title as part of Eblaite bureaucracy is ambiguous; each lugal was under the authority of the grand vizier, and the bearers ruled cities directly under the authority of the capital and they all brought goods to be kept in Ebla's storehouses. Pettinato counted 14 different lugals in the Eblaite administrative texts and deduced that the kingdom was divided into fourteen departments; two of them in the capital itself and the remaining twelve spanned the rest of the kingdom.\nUgula: the title is translated as superintendent; some ugulas were independent rulers and some represented the highest authority of a tribal group. Many cities had an appointed ugula as their head of administration such as the city of Darum.\n\nChora\nThe regions under the direct control of the king that were economically vital for the capital are called the \"chora\" by archaeologists. Regions under direct control of the king extended beyond the chora and it is difficult to determine the exact size of the kingdom and the chora due to the constant military expansion of Ebla which added new territories; some of those were ruled directly while others were allowed to retain their own rulers as vassals.\nGenerally, the chora is the core region of Ebla that includes the economic hinterland supporting the capital. It includes the cities and villages where the king or his vizier had palaces, towns that included important sanctuaries of gods related to the royal institution, towns visited by the monarch during the different rituals he participated in (such as the renewal of royalty ritual), and other cities such as the ones where textiles were delivered. The chora spans around 3000 km2; from west to east it includes the plains east of Jabal Zawiya, the Maṭkh swamp, al-Hass mountain and mount Shabīth. Areas directly on the borders of the chora such as al-Ghab, al-Rouge plain and al-Jabbul have close cultural affinity with the chora.\n\nPeople, language, and culture\nThe first and second kingdoms\nMardikh II's periods shared the same culture. the population of Ebla during Mardikh IIB1 (2400–2300 BC) is estimated to have numbered around 40,000 in the capital, and over 200,000 people in the entire kingdom. The Eblaites of Mardikh II were Semite-speakers close to their Northwestern Semitic neighbors, such as the Amorites. Giovanni Pettinato said the Eblaite language, one of the oldest attested Semitic languages, was a West Semitic language; Gelb and others said it was an East Semitic dialect closer to the Akkadian language. Academic consensus considers Eblaite an East Semitic language which exhibits both West and East Semitic features.\nEbla held several religious and social festivals, including rituals for the succession of a new king, which normally lasted for several weeks. The Eblaite calendars were based on a solar year divided into twelve months. Two calendars were discovered; the \"old calendar\" used during the reign of Igrish-Halam, and a \"new calendar\" introduced by vizier Ibbi-Sipish. Many months were named in honor of deities; in the new calendar, \"Itu be-li\" was the first month of the year, and meant \"the month of the lord\". Each year was given a name instead of a number.\nWomen received salaries equal to those of men and could accede to important positions and head government agencies. The Eblaites imported Kungas from Nagar, and used them to draw the carriages of royalty and high officials, as well as diplomatic gifts for allied cities. Society was less centered around the palace and the temple than in Mesopotamian kingdoms. The Eblaite palace was designed around the courtyard, which was open toward the city, thus making the administration approachable. This contrasts with Mesopotamian palaces, which resembled citadels with narrow entrances and limited access to the external courtyard. Music played an important part in the society and musicians were both locals, or hired from other cities such as Mari. Ebla also hired acrobats from Nagar, but later reduced their number and kept some to train local Eblaite acrobats.\n\nThe third kingdom\nThe Mardikh III population was predominately Semitic Amorite. The Amorites were mentioned in the first kingdom's tablets as neighbors and as rural subjects, and they came to dominate Ebla after the destruction of the second kingdom. The city witnessed a great increase in construction, and many palaces, temples and fortifications were built. The Amorite-speaking Eblaites worshiped many of the same deities as the Paleo-Syrian-speaking Eblaites of earlier periods, and maintained the sanctity of the acropolis in the center of the city. The third kingdom's iconography and royal ideology were under the influence of Yamhad's culture; kingship was received from the Yamhadite deities instead of Ishtar of Ebla, which is evident by the Eblaite seals of Indilimma's period.\n\nGenetics\nAncient DNA analysis on 10 human remains dating to the Early and Middle Bronze Age from Ebla found that Eblaites were a mixture of Copper age Levantines and Mesopotamians, and were genetically similar to contemporaneous Levantines.\nOne Early Bronze Age (2700-2500 BC) individual carried haplogroup E1b1b1b2a-M123, a lineage likely linked to the diffusion of Afroasiatic languages. Another Early Bronze Age (2572-2470 cal BCE) individual belonged to J1a2a1a2-P58, while four Middle Bronze Age (2000-1800 BC) individuals carried haplogroups J1a2a1a2-P58 (x2), G2a and the West Asian  T1a1-L162 which was present since the middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) Levant.\n\nEconomy\nDuring the first kingdom period, the palace controlled the economy, but wealthy families managed their financial affairs without government intervention. The economic system was redistributive; the palace distributed food to its permanent and seasonal workers. It is estimated that around 40,000 persons contributed to this system, but in general, and unlike in Mesopotamia, land stayed in the hands of villages, which paid an annual share to the palace. Agriculture was mainly pastoral; large herds of cattle were managed by the palace. The city's inhabitants owned around 140,000 head of sheep and goats, and 9,000 cattle.\nEbla derived its prosperity from trade; its wealth was equal to that of the most important Sumerian cities, and its main commercial rival was Mari. Ebla's main articles of trade were probably timber from the nearby mountains, and textiles. Handicrafts also appear to have been a major export, evidenced by the quantity of artifacts recovered from the palaces of the city. Ebla possessed a wide commercial network reaching as far as modern-day Afghanistan. It shipped textiles to Cyprus, possibly through the port of Ugarit, but most of its trade seems to have been directed by river-boat towards Mesopotamia – chiefly Kish. The main palace G was found to contain artifacts dating from Ancient Egypt bearing the names of the pharaohs Khafre and Pepi I.\nEbla continued to be a center of trade during the second kingdom, evidenced by the surrounding cities that appeared during its period and were destroyed along with the city. Trade continued to be Ebla's main economic activity during the third kingdom; archaeological finds show there was an extensive exchange with Egypt and coastal Syrian cities such as Byblos.\n\nReligion\nEbla was a polytheistic state. During the first kingdom, Eblaites worshiped their dead kings. The pantheon of the first Ebla included pairs of deities which are classified into three types: couples (the most common type) such as a male deity and his female consort; divine twosomes such as the deities that cooperate to create the cosmos in the Egyptian and Mesopotamian pantheons;and \"divine pairs\" who were actually a single deity with two names. Eblaites worshiped few Mesopotamian deities, preferring North-Western Semitic gods, some of which were unique to Ebla. The first pair-type, couples, included Hadabal (dNI-da-KUL), who was exclusive to Ebla, and his consort, Belatu (\"his wife\"); Rasap and his consort Adamma; the patron gods of the city Kura, who was unique to Ebla, and his consort Barama. Among the divine pairs were artisan god Kamish/Tit, Kothar-wa-Khasis and the planet Venus represented by twin mountain gods; Shahar as the morning star and Shalim as the evening star.\nThe first Eblaites worshiped many other deities, such as the Syrian goddess Ishara, who was the goddess of the royal family. Ishtar was also worshiped but was mentioned only five times in one of the monthly offering lists, while Ishara was far more important, appearing 40 times. Other deities included Damu; the Mesopotamian god Utu; Ashtapi; Dagan; Hadad (Hadda) and his consort Halabatu (\"she of Halab\"); and Shipish, the goddess of the sun who had a temple dedicated to her cult. The four city gates were named after the gods Dagan, Hadda, Rasap and Utu, but it is unknown which gate had which name. Overall, the offering list mentioned about 40 deities receiving sacrifices.\nDuring the third kingdom, Amorites worshiped common northern Semitic gods; the unique Eblaite deities disappeared. Hadad was the most important god, while Ishtar took Ishara's place and became the city's most important deity apart from Hadad.\n\nBiblical connection theories\nAt the beginning of the process of deciphering the tablets, Giovanni Pettinato made claims about possible connections between Ebla and the Bible, citing alleged references in the tablets to the existence of Yahweh, the Patriarchs, Sodom and Gomorrah and other Biblical references. However, much of the initial media excitement about a supposed Eblaite connections with the Bible, based on preliminary guesses and speculations by Pettinato and others, is now widely discredited and the academic consensus is that Ebla \"has no bearing on the Minor Prophets, the historical accuracy of the Biblical Patriarchs, Yahweh worship, or Sodom and Gomorrah\". In Ebla studies, the focus has shifted away from comparisons with the Bible; Ebla is now studied as a civilization in its own right. The claims led to a bitter personal and academic conflict between the scholars involved, as well as what some described as political interference by the Syrian authorities.\n\nExcavations\nIn 1964, Italian archaeologists from the University of Rome La Sapienza under the direction of Paolo Matthiae began excavating at Tell Mardikh. In 1968, they recovered a statue dedicated to the goddess Ishtar bearing the name of Ibbit-Lim, mentioning him as king of Ebla. That identified the city, long known from Lagashite and Akkadian inscriptions. In the next decade, the team discovered a palace (palace G) dating from c. 2500–2000 BC. Finds in the palaces include a small sculpture made out of precious materials, Lapis lazuli, black stones and gold.\nThirteen full and fragmentary lenticular cuneiform tablets were found in the palace throne room, thought to have been there versus the archive because of the city's fall. In a storeroom off the throne room, the nearly complete standard of the queen and fragments believed to come from the standard of the king were found. Other artifacts included wood furniture inlaid with mother-of-pearl and composite statues created from colored stones. A silver bowl bearing king Immeya's name was recovered from the \"Tomb of the Lord of the Goats\", together with Egyptian jewels and an Egyptian ceremonial mace presented by pharaoh Hotepibre.\nAbout 17,000 cuneiform tablet fragments were discovered; when put together, they constitute 2,500 complete tablets, making the archive of Ebla one of the biggest from the 3rd millennium BC. About 80% of the tablets are written using the usual Sumerian combination of logograms and phonetic signs, while the others exhibited an innovative, purely phonetic representation using Sumerian cuneiform of a previously unknown Semitic language, which was called \"Eblaite\". Bilingual Sumerian/Eblaite vocabulary lists were found among the tablets, allowing them to be translated. The tablets provide many important insights into the cultural, economic and political life in northern Mesopotamia around the middle of the 3rd millennium BC. They also provide insight into the everyday lives of the inhabitants, and contain information about state revenues, Sumerian-Eblaite dictionaries, diplomatic exchanges with foreign rulers, school texts, hymns and myths.\n\nLibrary\nThe over 4000-year-old tablets constitute the oldest library ever found. At Ebla, \"the archives or library constituted an orderly collection of records at least 500 years older than any other that had been found anywhere before.\" There is evidence of their arrangement and classification. The larger tablets had originally been stored on shelves, but had fallen onto the floor when the palace was destroyed. The locations of the fallen tablets allowed the excavators to reconstruct their original positions on the shelves. They found the tablets had originally been shelved according to subject.\nThese features were absent from earlier Sumerian excavations. Sophisticated techniques of arrangement of texts, coupled with their composition, evidence the great antiquity of archival and library practices, which may be far older than was assumed to be the case before the discovery of the Ebla library. A sizable portion of the tablets contain literary and lexicographic texts; evidence seems to suggest the collection also served – at least partially – as a true library rather than a collection of archives intended solely for use by the kings, their ministers, and their bureaucracy. The tablets show evidence of the early transcription of texts into foreign languages and scripts, classification and cataloging for easier retrieval, and arrangement by size, form and content. The Ebla tablets have thus provided scholars with new insights into the origin of library practices that were in use 4,500 years ago.\nWhile the absolute chronology of the archive is not yet certain a relative chronology for the 50-year period has been established. Because Ebla did not use Mesopotamian style year names or year numbers and the name of rulers was rarely mentioned in the texts scholars used script changes, grammar changes, and most importantly a prosopography of the members of the court, especially the wives and daughters of the king. The most relevant tablets for this effort were a series of yearly metal accounts and monthly linen accounts.\nMost of the recovered tablets and tablet fragments were stored at the Idlib Regional Museum in Syria. Their current condition is unknown.\n\nLegacy\nEbla's first kingdom is an example of early Syrian centralized states, and is considered one of the earliest empires by scholars, such as Samuel Finer, and Karl Moore, who consider it the first-recorded world power. Ebla's discovery changed the former view of Syria's history as a bridge between Mesopotamia and Egypt; it proved the region was a center of civilization in its own right.\n\nSyrian Civil War\nAs a result of the Syrian Civil War, excavations of Ebla stopped in March 2011. By 2013, it was under control of an opposition armed group called Arrows of the Right, who took advantage of its elevated location to use it as an observation point to watch for incoming government air attacks, as well as attempting to protect the site from looting. Many tunnels were dug and a crypt full of human remains was discovered; the remains were scattered and discarded by the robbers, who hoped to find jewelry and other precious artifacts. Besides excavations by rebels, nearby villagers also began digging at the site with the aim of finding and looting artifacts; some villagers removed carloads of soil suitable for making ceramic liners for bread-baking ovens from the tunnels.\nThe site was captured by the Syrian Armed Forces on 30 January 2020 during the 5th Northwestern Syria offensive, along with surrounding villages.\n\nSee also\nAzi (scribe)\nBiblical archaeology\nDugurasu\nCities of the Ancient Near East\nList of kings of Ebla\nMari, Syria\nShort chronology timeline\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nFurther reading\nBonechi, Marco. \"More on the Ebla gatekeepers\", Revue d’Assyriologie et d’archéologie Orientale, vol. 106, pp. 33–36, 2012\nCatagnoti, Amalia. \"In the aftermath of the war.

          "summary": "Ebla (Sumerian: 𒌈𒆷 eb₂-la, Arabic: إبلا, modern: تل مرديخ, Tell Mardikh) was one of the earliest kingdoms in Syria. Its remains constitute a tell located about 55 km (34 mi) southwest of Aleppo near the village of Mardikh. Ebla was an important center throughout the 3rd millennium BC and in the first half of the 2nd millennium BC. Its discovery proved the Levant was a center of ancient, centralized civilization equal to Egypt and Mesopotamia and ruled out the view that the latter two were the only important centers in the Near East during the Early Bronze Age.\n\nStarting as a small settlement in the Early Bronze Age (c. 3500 BC), Ebla developed into a trading empire and later into an expansionist power that imposed its hegemony over much of northern and eastern Syria. Ebla was destroyed during the 23rd century BC. It was then rebuilt and was mentioned in the records of the Third Dynasty of Ur. The second Ebla was a continuation of the first, ruled by a new royal dynasty. It was destroyed at the end of the 3rd millennium BC, which paved the way for the Amorite tribes to settle in the city, forming the third Ebla. The third kingdom also flourished as a trade center; it became a subject and an ally of Yamhad (modern-day Aleppo) until its final destruction by the Hittite king Mursili I in c. 1600 BC.\nEbla maintained its prosperity through a vast trading network. Artifacts from Sumer, Cyprus, Egypt and as far as Afghanistan were recovered from the city's palaces. The kingdom had its own language, Eblaite, and the political organization of Ebla had features different from the Sumerian model. Women enjoyed a special status, and the queen had major influence in the state and religious affairs. The pantheon of gods was mainly north Semitic and included deities exclusive to Ebla. The city was excavated from 1964 and became famous for the Ebla tablets, an archive of about 20,000 cuneiform tablets found there, dated to 2500 BC–2350 BC. Written in both Sumerian and Eblaite and using the cuneiform, the archive has allowed a better understanding of the Sumerian language and provided important information over the political organization and social customs of the mid-3rd millennium BC's Levant.",

          "content": "Ugarit (; Ugaritic: 𐎜𐎂𐎗𐎚, ủgrt /ʾUgarītu/) was an ancient Levantine coastal city located in what is today northern Syria. The site, with its corpus of ancient cuneiform texts, was discovered in 1928. The texts were written in a previously unknown Northwest Semitic tongue—the Ugaritic language. Archaeological excavations of Ugarit show evidence of occupation since the 8th millennium BC. Research has focused on the late Bronze Age levels; relatively little is known about earlier occupation. The ongoing archaeological investigation of Ugarit has proven to be invaluable to the study of the Bronze Age in the eastern Mediterranean.\nUgarit is 10 km north of the Syrian city Latakia; at its zenith it ruled an area roughly equivalent to the modern Latakia Governorate. The ruins are often called \"Ras Shamra\" or \"Tell Shamra\" after the local place names.\n\nHistory\nUgarit has its origins in the Neolithic period of the Fertile Crescent. The site was occupied from the end of the 8th millennium BC and continued as a settlement through the Near Eastern Chalcolithic and Bronze Ages until its destruction in c. 1185 BC. It was during the Late Bronze Age (c. 3300 – 1200 BC) that Ugarit saw significant growth, culminating in the establishment of the Kingdom of Ugarit.\nThe city had close ties to the Hittite Empire, in later periods as a vassal state. It sent tribute to Egypt at times, and maintained trade and diplomatic relations with Cyprus (then called Alashiya), as documented in archives recovered from the site and corroborated by Mycenaean and Cypriot pottery found there. The polity was at its height from c. 1450 BC until c. 1185 BC; when it was destroyed, possibly through a combination of invading Sea Peoples and internal struggles. The Kingdom of Ugarit would be one of the many polities that fell in the Late Bronze Age collapse of 12th century BC. Gibala (Tell Tweini), a coastal city at the southern edge of the Kingdom of Ugarit, was also destroyed at this time.\n\nMiddle Bronze Age\nMiddle Bronze II\nUgarit was associated with the Semitic-speaking Kingdom of Yamhad which emerged c. 1900 BC, centered near modern Aleppo in Northern Syria. Ugarit is mentioned in the cache of tablets written in Akkadian cuneiform which were recovered from the ancient Sumerian and Amorite city-state of Mari on the upper Euphrates in Syria, dated c. 1800 – 1750 BC\nUgarit had contacts with the Egyptian Middle Kingdom (c. 2000 – 1700 BC). One artifact is a carnelian bead inscribed with the name of Senusret I. A stela and a statuette from the Egyptian pharaohs Senusret III and Amenemhet III have also been recovered; it is unclear at what time these objects were brought to Ugarit.\n\nLate Bronze Age\nThe city reached its golden age between 1500 BC and 1200 BC when it ruled a mercantile coastal kingdom, trading with Egypt, Cyprus, Aegean states (primarily Minoan Crete), polities in Syria, the Hittites, cities of the Levantine core (including Ascalon in Canaan), and much of the eastern Mediterranean. Five of the Egyptian Amarna letters from the mid-14th century BCE were written in Ugarit. The population of Ugarit in this period is estimated to be between 7,000 and 8,000 individuals. The kingdom of Ugarit controlled about 2,000 km2 on average.\nIn the mid-14th century BC, Ugarit was ruled by king Ammittamru I. A letter (EA45) sent by him, probably to pharaoh Amenhotep III (1388–1351 BC), expresses cordial diplomatic relations between the two. During the reign of his son Niqmaddu II (c. 1350–1315 BC) Ugarit became a vassal of the Hittite Empire, first under a viceroy in Karkemiš and then, with the Hititte collapse, directly under Karkemiš. Diplomatic relations with Egypt continued, as evidenced by two letters sent by Niqmaddu II (EA49) and his wife Ḫeba (EA48), probably sent to Akhenaten (1351–1334 BC). The former includes a request from the Egyptian king to send a physician to Ugarit.\n\nDestruction\nFrom the late 13th century into the early 12th century BC the eastern Mediterranean faced severe and widespread food shortages, possibly from crop failures due to plant disease. The kings of Ugarit—a major supplier and transporter of foodstuffs—received a number of desperate pleas for food from neighboring states. Eventually Ugarit itself faced shortage and hunger. A letter from Egyptian pharaoh Merenptah (r. 1213 – 1203 BC) referred to a message sent by the ruler of Ugarit:\n\nSo you had written to me: “Could I not have demanded my needs [from] the Great King, the king of Egypt, my lord? I demand this request: [In] the land of Ugarit there is a severe hunger (bi-ru-ú dan-niš): May my lord save [the land of Ugarit], and may the king give grain (ZÍZ.AN.MEŠ) to save my life … and to save the citizens of the land of Ugarit.\n\nThe last king of Ugarit, Ammurapi (c. 1215 – 1180 BC), was a contemporary of the last known Hittite king, Suppiluliuma II. A letter by Ammurapi stresses the seriousness of the crisis faced by many Near Eastern states due to attacks from outsiders (see Sea Peoples). Ugarit's army and navy joined with Hittite forces to stem the oncoming enemy; the allies eventually had to fall back from Anatolia to the Syrian frontier. Ammurapi's response to the king of Alashiya's appeal for assistance from highlights the desperate situation in Ugarit and across the eastern Mediterranean:\n\nMy father, behold, the enemy's ships came (here); my cities(?) were burned, and they did evil things in my country. Does not my father know that all my troops and chariots(?) are in the Land of Hatti, and all my ships are in the Land of Lukka? ... Thus, the country is abandoned to itself. May my father know it: the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us.\n\nEshuwara, the senior governor of Alashiya, responded:\n\nAs for the matter concerning those enemies: (it was) the people from your country (and) your own ships (who) did this! And (it was) the people from your country (who) committed these transgression(s) ... I am writing to inform you and protect you. Be aware!\nIn the end Ammurapi begged for forces from the Hittite viceroy at Karkemiš. The invaders had captured the kingdom's other port, Ra’šu, and were advancing on the city of Ugarit.\n\nTo the king, my lord say, thus Ammurapi, your servant.… I wrote you twice, thrice, [new]s regarding the enemy! … May my lord know that now the enemy forces are stationed at Ra’šu, and their avant-guard forces were sent to Ugarit. Now may my lord send me forces and chariots, and may my lord save me from the forces of this enemy!\n\nThe viceroy sent troops to assist Ugarit, but Ugarit had already been sacked when the Hittite forces reached the city. A letter written to the viceroy after the destruction said:\n\nWhen your messenger arrived, the army was humiliated and the city was sacked. Our food in the threshing floors was burnt and the vineyards were also destroyed. Our city is sacked. May you know it! May you know it!\n\nRulers\nEarly in the excavations a partial text of the Ugarit King List, in Ugaritic, was found. Later, complete renditions in Akkadian were discovered. They list twenty six rulers, all deified. Only the later rulers are supported by texts or known synchronisms. Given that Ugarit was abandoned between the Middle and Late Bronze Ages it is thought that the earliest names on the list were more on the order of tribal chiefs than kings.\n\nArchaeology\nArchaeological soundings of Ugarit indicate that it was first occupied in the Neolithic period, no later than the eighth millennium BC. Only the highest—i.e., the newest—levels of the city's ruins have been excavated. The recovered evidence gives a picture of Ugaritic civilization just before its destruction in the Late Bronze Age collapse of the  late 12th century BC. This evidence includes many caches of cuneiform tablets found inside libraries.\nWhile the chronology of the ancient Near East and that of ancient Egypt are not perfectly synchronized, the trove of Ugaritic texts and artifacts has proven invaluable for precise chronological dating.\nFor example, a recovered tablet shows that Chancellor Bay, an official of the Egyptian queen Twosret, was in communication with Ammurapi, the last ruler of Ugarit. It was already established that Bay was in office from approximately 1194 to 1190 BC. The two pieces of evidence together thus set an upper limit on the year of Ugarit's destruction: 1194 BC.\nBy the same method, the Ugarit trove allowed archaeologists to establish dates across the eastern Mediterranean with greater precision. For example:\n\nThe destruction levels of the ruins—i.e., the archaeological strata comprising Ugarit when it was destroyed—contain Late Helladic (LH) IIIB pottery but no pottery of the succeeding LH IIIC phase (see Mycenaean period). To fix an end date of Ugarit would thus prove crucial to establishing the chronology of the LH IIIC phase in mainland Greece.\nAn Egyptian sword bearing the name of pharaoh Merneptah was recovered from the destruction levels. A recovered cuneiform tablet showed that Ugarit was destroyed sometime after Merneptah's death in 1203 BC.\nAn early consensus held that Ugarit was destroyed by no later than the eighth year of the reign of pharaoh Ramesses III, 1178 BC.\nRadiocarbon dating combined with translations of cuneiform records and the absolute dating of recorded astronomical events, e.g., an eclipse in 1192 BC, indicate destruction between 1192 and 1190 BC.\nThe beginning of the LH IIIC in mainland Greece could thus be dated to 1190 BC.\nA large number of arrowheads were recovered from the destruction level in 2021. Their typology has not been published as yet.\n\nDiscovery and excavations\nAfter its destruction in the early 12th century BC, Ugarit's location was forgotten until 1928 when a peasant accidentally opened an old tomb while plowing a field. At that time the region was part of the Alawite State and not in Syria. The uncovered area was the necropolis of Ugarit, located in the nearby seaport of Minet el-Beida. Excavations have since revealed a city with a prehistory reaching back to c. 6000 BC.\nThe site covers an area of about 28 hectares with a maximum height of 20 meters at the top of the acropolis. The site is surrounded by a city wall with one known fortified gate, though four gates are believed to have existed. Since the Late Bronze Age about 50 meters have been eroded from the north end of the site by the Nahr Chbayyeb river. The southern slope of the mound, or tell, is covered by orange groves, preventing excavation. A brief investigation of a looted tomb at the necropolis of Minet el-Beida was conducted by Léon Albanèse in 1928, who then examined the main tell of Ras Shamra. Beginning in 1929 excavations of Ugarit were conducted by a French team called the Mission de Ras Shamra led by archaeologist Claude Schaeffer from the Musée archéologique in Strasbourg. Work continued until 1939 when it was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II.\nThe French excavation, now the Mission Archeologique Française de Ras Shamra-Ougarit, resumed in 1950, led again by Claude Schaeffer until 1970. At that point, directorship passed to Jean Margueron. After 44 excavation seasons all of the numerous finds and their findspots were collated. In 2005 the excavation became a joint French and Syrian effort led by Valérie Matoïan and Khozama Al-Bahloul. Excavations were interrupted by the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011.\nArchaeologists have defined a number of occupation strata at the site based on the excavations:\n\nStrata 1 - 500-300 BC - Helenistic up thru Arabi\nLacuna - 900-600 BC - no occupation\nStratum 2 - 1100-900 BC - Iron Age\nStratum 3 - 1365-1200 BC - Late Bronze 2 = RS 1/3 = UR 3\nStratum 4 - 1450-1365 BC - Late Bronze 1-2 = RS 1/2 = UR 2\nStratum 5 - 1550-1450 BC - Late Bronze 1 = RS 1/1 = UR 1\nLacuna - 1650-1550 BC - no occupation\nStratum 6 - 1750-1650 BC - Middle Bronze '3' = RS 2/3 = UM 2\nStratum 7 - 1900-1750 BC - Middle Bronze '2' = RS 2/2 = UM 2 = Middle Minoan 2\nStratum 8 - 2100-1900 BC - Middle Bronze = RS 2/1 = UM 1\nStratum 9 - 2300-2100 BC - Early Bronze 4 = RS 3/3 or III A; = UA 3\nStratum 10 - 2500-2300 BC - Early Bronze 3 = RS 3/2 or III A 2 + 3; = UA 2\nStratum 11 - c. 2800 BC - Early Bronze 1 - 2 = RS 3/1 or III B-C; = UA 1\nStratum 12 - c. 3300 BC - 'Ubayd chalcolithic = RS 4 A-B (with some RS 3)\nStratum 13 - 4000 - 3400 BC - Halaf chalcolithic = RS 4-C (4 A-B)\nStratum 14 - c. 4000 BC - Neolithic with pottery = RS 5 A-B\nStratum 15 - c. 4500 BC - Pre-Pottery Neolithic = RS 5-C\nA number of areas lay within the fortifications of Ugarit. In the northwest section was an acropolis with the temples of Dagon and Baal. In the west was the Royal Zone, including the Royal Palace. A fortress protecting the latter area was excavated, with the earliest elements dating back to the Middle Bronze Age. To the west of that lies the modern village of Ras Shamra. There were densely populated residential areas to the east of the Royal Zone and on the southern slope of the tell.\n\nCuneiform tablets\nSeveral thousand cuneiform tablets have been found. By the Late Bronze age Ugarit had a thriving dual-scribal system. Primarily it used the East Semitic Akkadian language which acted as the lingua franca throughout the region for diplomacy, business, and administrative purposes. Other languages were also used \"including Sumerian, Hittite, Hurrian, Egyptian, Cypro-Minoan, Phoenician, and Luwian\". In parallel, there was scribal activity in the local Northwest Semitic Ugaritic language. A few scribes are known to have worked in both writing systems. A number of archives were found, the largest being that of the household of Urtēnu, a merchant with trading ties as far afield as Emar. This area of the tell was under military control at the time and about 100 tablets were found in the rubble from military construction. Later excavation found several hundred tablets in the actual home. One tablet mentions the enthronement of Kassite ruler Kadashman-Harbe II (c. 1223 BC) whose rule lasted less than a year, allowing a tight synchronism. The latest datable text was from the reign of Kassite ruler Meli-Shipak II (c. 1186–1172 BC) about the time of the destruction of Ugarit. An example of the archive involving one ton of copper:\n\nThus Kušmešuša, king of Alašiya, say to Niqmaddu, king of Ugarit, my son. All is well with me, my households, my countries, my wives, my sons, my troops, my horses and my chariots.… In exchange of the gift which you had sent me, I sent to you thirty-three (ingots of) copper; their weight is thirty talents and six-thousand and five-hundred shekels.\n\nOne small tablet written in Cypro-Minoan was found on the surface of the tell. While it traditionally has been assumed that syllabic texts are in the Akkadian language and alphabetic texts are in Ugaritic it has been suggested that much of the syllabic writing, especially in administrative documents, is actually in \"a jargon where an Akkadian dialect is hard to detect given the great amount of Ugaritic elements it contained\".\n\nRoyal palace\nThe Royal Palace was constructed over several major phases between the 15th and 13th centuries BC. It comprised rooms arranged around courtyards, encompassing 6,500 square meters before the city's destruction in the early 12th century BC. A tablet from the 14th century BC found in the Amarna archives, EA 89,  Rib-Hadda of Byblos likening the palace at Tyre to the grandeur found in the palace within Ugarit's walls. The palace was well constructed, predominantly crafted from stone, with preserved ashlar blocks reaching heights of up to 4 meters. Wooden crossbeams were also incorporated, inserted into slots within the stone masonry. A thick layer of plain plaster covered the walls. To the west of the palace was a set aside 10,000 square meter Royal Zone.\n\nArchaeological findings within the ruins have included a variety of artifacts including ivory carvings, stone stele, figurines, and numerous tablets. These tablets were discovered in archives located across the palace; their contents encompass reports on outlying regions, judicial records—particularly from the south-central archives of the palace—and examples of practice writing by young scribes. Below ground, beneath two northern rooms, lay family tombs—three large chambers constructed with corbelled vaults—found devoid of any contents. The vanished upper floor likely accommodated the private quarters of the royal family, accessed via twelve staircases.\n\nAcropolis\nThe Acropolis, positioned in the Ugarit's northeastern section, housed the city's primary temples dedicated to Baal and his father, Dagan. Though the existing remnants date to the Late Bronze Age, these temples might have their origins in the Middle Bronze Age. Stelai discovered in this area portray or name these gods, affirming their identification for the respective cults. Within the Temple of Baal, discoveries include the Baal with Thunderbolt depicting Baal holding a club aloft, portrayed in a typical Near Eastern and Egyptian artistic style as well as a stela bearing a dedication to Baal of Sapan. Numerous statues, stelai—some offered by Egyptians—and sixteen stone anchors were found as votive offerings in this vicinity.\n\nBoth temples are composed of a pronaos (porch) and a naos (sanctuary proper), aligned from north-northeast to south-southwest. The Temple of Dagan has 4–5-meter-thick foundation walls. Remnants of the Temple of Baal encompass sections of an enclosing wall, a likely courtyard altar, monumental steps leading to the elevated pronaos and naos, and another presumed altar within the naos. The temple was destroyed, possibly by an earthquake, in the mid 13th century and not rebuilt. The Temple of Dagan was also destroyed at that time but was rebuilt.\nAnother significant structure within the Acropolis was the House of the High Priest, situated west of the Temple of Dagan. This large, two-story residence, largely well-constructed, contained tablets containing mythological poems. Some tablets demonstrated writing exercises and included syllabic and bilingual lexicons, implying the building's use as a center for scribe training. Its proximity to the primary temples and the discovery of bronze tools, particularly four small adzes and a dedicated hoe, hints at its potential role as the residence of the city's chief priest. Among a cache of seventy-four bronze items uncovered beneath a doorway threshold inside the house, was an elegant tripod adorned with pomegranate-shaped pendants.\n\nRas Ibn Hani and Minet el Beida\nTwo other sites within the city of Ugarit, Ras Ibn Hani and Minet el Beida, have also been excavated. Ras Ibn Hani, on a promontory overlooking the Mediterranean 5 kilometers south of the city, was discovered during commercial construction in 1977. Salvage excavation occurred in 1977 followed by regular excavation which has continued to the present by a Syrian-French  team led by A. Bounni and J. Lagarce. Occupation began in the mid-13th century BC. Abandoned along with Ugarit, it was re-occupied in the Hellenistic period, including the construction of a defensive fortress. A \"royal palace\", elite housing, and tombs were found. About 169 cuneiform tablets, most in the Ugaritic language, were also found.\n\nOne of the two ports of ancient Ugarit (the other, Ra’šu, is unlocated but suggested to be Ras Ibn Hani) was located 1.5 kilometers west of the main city, at the natural harbor of Minet el Beida (Arabic for \"White Harbor\"). The 28 hectare site was excavated between 1929 and 1935 by Claude Schaeffer. The site is currently a military port and unavailable for excavation. Its name in the Late Bronze Age is believed to have been Maʾḫadu. Archaeological excavations carried out on the southern side of the bay, now reduced in size due to alluvial fill, unveiled remnants of a settlement established in the 14th century BC, and perhaps earlier, in the late 15th century. This port town, featuring an urban layout akin to the city of Ugarit, displays irregular street formations. Dwellings were structured around courtyards with adjacent rooms, including provisions like wells, ovens, and occasionally subterranean tombs. Besides residential spaces and shrines, warehouses were present for storing diverse goods earmarked for import or export. One of them was discovered still housing eighty shipping jars that remain remarkably intact.\nArtifacts discovered in the port indicate the predominance of native Ugaritians within the local populace, accompanied by a significant presence of various foreign communities such as Egyptians, Cypriots, Hittites, Hurrians, and Aegean peoples. Among the discoveries were Cypriot pottery (both imported and locally crafted), Mycenaean pottery, ivory cosmetic containers from Egypt, a terracotta depiction of Hathor, bronze tools and weaponry, cylinder seals, stone weights, remnants of banded dye-murex shells used in the production of purple dye, and inscribed tablets.\nThe site is thought to have been largely evacuated before it was burned (resulting in a thick ash layer) and destroyed as few valuables were found in the residences or in the southern palace. About 130 cuneiform tablets were found in the northern palace. After the destruction the site was occupied by simple residences, termed a village by the excavators. Aegean style pottery and loom weights were found in this Iron Age I level.\n\nLanguage and literature\nAlphabet\nScribes in Ugarit appear to have developed the Ugaritic alphabet around 1400 BC; 30 letters, corresponding to sounds, were inscribed on clay tablets. Although they are cuneiform in appearance, the letters bear no relation to Mesopotamian cuneiform signs; instead, they appear to be related to the Egyptian-derived Phoenician alphabet. While the letters show little or no formal similarity to the Phoenician, the standard letter order (seen in the Phoenician alphabet as ʔ, B, G, D, H, W, Z, Ḥ, Ṭ, Y, K, L, M, N, S, ʕ, P, Ṣ, Q, R, Š, T) shows strong similarities between the two, suggesting that the Phoenician and Ugaritic systems were not wholly independent inventions. A Unicode block for Ugaritic has been defined.\n\nUgaritic language\nThe existence of the Ugaritic language is attested to in texts from the 14th through the 12th century BC. Ugaritic is usually classified as a Northwest Semitic language and therefore related to Hebrew, Aramaic, and Phoenician, among others. Its grammatical features are highly similar to those found in Classical Arabic and Akkadian. It possesses two genders (masculine and feminine), three cases for nouns and adjectives (nominative, accusative, and genitive); three numbers: (singular, dual, and plural); and verb aspects similar to those found in other Northwest Semitic languages. The word order in Ugaritic is verb–subject–object (VSO) and subject-object-verb (SOV); possessed–possessor (NG) (first element dependent on the function and second always in genitive case); and noun–adjective (NA) (both in the same case (i.e. congruent)).\n\nUgaritic literature\nApart from royal correspondence with neighboring Bronze Age monarchs, Ugaritic literature from tablets found in the city's libraries include mythological texts written in a poetic narrative, letters, legal documents such as land transfers, a few international treaties, and a number of administrative lists. Fragments of several poetic works have been identified: the \"Legend of Keret\", the \"Legend of Danel\", the Ba'al tales that detail Baal-Hadad's conflicts with Yam and Mot, among other fragments.\n\nSee also\nAsherah\nCities of the ancient Near East\nShort chronology timeline\nList of Ugaritic deities\nUgaritic Vintage Rites\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nUgarit (Tell Shamra) 1999 application for UNESCO World Heritage Site\nRSTI.

The site, with its corpus of ancient cuneiform texts, was discovered in 1928. The texts were written in a previously unknown Northwest Semitic tongue—the Ugaritic language. Archaeological excavations of Ugarit show evidence of occupation since the 8th millennium BC. Research has focused on the late Bronze Age levels; relatively little is known about earlier occupation. The ongoing archaeological investigation of Ugarit has proven to be invaluable to the study of the Bronze Age in the eastern Mediterranean.\nUgarit is 10 km north of the Syrian city Latakia; at its zenith it ruled an area roughly equivalent to the modern Latakia Governorate. The ruins are often called \"Ras Shamra\" or \"Tell Shamra\" after the local place names.",

Most of the villages, which date from the 1st to 7th centuries, were abandoned between the 8th and 10th centuries. The settlements feature the well-preserved architectural remains of buildings such as dwellings, pagan temples, churches, cisterns and bathhouses. Important dead cities include the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites, Dahis, Serjilla, Ruweiha and al Bara.\nThe Dead Cities are situated in an elevated area of limestone known as Limestone Massif. These ancient settlements cover an area 20–40 km (12–25 mi) wide and some 140 km (87 mi) long. The Massif includes three groups of highlands: the first is the northern group of Mount Simeon and Mount Kurd; the second middle group is the group of Harim Mountains; the third southern group is the group of Zawiya Mountain.\n\nHistory\nChris Wickham, in the authoritative survey of the post-Roman world, \"Framing the Early Middle Ages\" (2006) argues that these were settlements of prosperous peasants which have few or no specifically urban features. The impressive remains of domestic architecture are the result of the prosperity of peasants who benefited from a strong international trade in olive oil at the end of Antiquity.\nAnother argument is that these were prosperous cities that flourished because they were located along major trade routes in the Byzantine Empire, and not merely prosperous peasant settlements. After conquest by the Arabs, the trade routes changed, and as a result, these towns lost the majority of the business which fostered their economies. On this view, settlers eventually abandoned their towns and headed for other cities that were flourishing under the Arabs and the Umayyads as increasing urbanisation took its toll.\nThe ancient villages of the Dead Cities illustrate the transition from the ancient pagan world of the Roman Empire to Byzantine Christianity.\nThe Dead Cites were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011, under the name of \"Ancient Villages of Northern Syria\". The Dead Cities were the 1348th site to be added to UNESCO's World Heritage Site list. The Dead Cities have been on the Endangered UNESCO list since 2013, meaning the site was not endangered for only two years.\nBefore the Syrian Civil War most sites had become easily accessible, the majority of the dead cities were well-preserved and tourists could access the sites quite freely, though some of the Dead Cities are quite difficult to reach without a guide (there is a guidebook by Abdallah Hadjar with a detailed map that is useful for finding the lesser known sites; The Church of St Simeon Stylites and Other Archaeological Sites in the Mountains of Simeon and Halaqa. However, the Syrian Civil War has caused Syrian refugees to flee to these sites in hopes of finding shelter. In various areas, refugees have repurposed the stone ruins located on these sites to rebuild their livelihoods.\n\nArcheological sites\nDead cities and archeological sites in Limestone Massif include Church of Saint Simeon Stylites, Serjilla, Bara, Basufan, Barisha, Qalb Loze, Barad, Cyrrhus, Turmanin, Banabil, Kafr Aruq, Kafr Dariyan, Babuline, Hazarin, Jarada, Maghara, Shinan, Farkya, Ein Laruz, Ebla, Deir Sunbul, Al-Dana, Sarmada and Al-Dana.\n\nMount Simeon, Mount Kurd and Mount Ḥalqa\nHarim Mountains (Mount Bārīshā and Mount A'lā)\nMount Zāwiya\nSee also\nWorld Heritage Sites in Danger\n\nReferences\nDarke, Diana (2020).

          "content": "The Church of Saint Simeon Stylites (Arabic: كنيسة مار سمعان العمودي, romanized: Kanīsat Mār Simʿān el-ʿAmūdī) is one of the oldest surviving church complexes, founded in the 5th century. It is located approximately 30 kilometres (19 mi) northwestern of Aleppo, Syria. It was constructed on the site of the pillar of Saint Simeon Stylites, a renowned stylite monk. The church is popularly known as either Qalaat Semaan (قلعة سمعان, Qalʿat Simʿān, the \"Fortress of Simeon\") or Deir Semaan (دير سمعان, Dayr Simʿān, the \"Monastery of Simeon\"). Completed in 490, it was not surpassed as a Christian church until the construction of Hagia Sophia was finished in 537.\n\nHistory\nSaint Simeon was born in 390 AD in the Amanus mountains village. He entered a monastery at the age of 16, but he was judged to be unsuited for cenobitic life due to his extravagant asceticism. Following the example of Saint Anthony, he attempted to live the life of a hermit ascetic in the wilderness, but his feats of physical endurance and self-denial attracted pilgrims seeking religious instruction and other devout admirers. In an effort to escape from such distractions, he resolved to live on a small platform atop a 3-meter column. The height of the column was raised over time to 18 meters. From his perch, Simeon preached twice a day to the crowds who gathered to witness this spectacle of self-mortification. A ladder attached to the column allowed messengers to bring food and written messages to Simeon, who also sent letters to his followers this way. He became well-known enough to attract the attention of the eastern emperors Theodosius, Leo, and Theodosius II, who sought his advice and implored his intervention in state affairs. Simeon lived on the column for years, dying in AD 459 at the approximate age of 69. After a fierce contest for the possession of his remains between Antioch and Constantinople, it was settled in favor of Antioch. His remains were transported to Antioch, accompanied by a procession of the patriarch of Constantinople, 6 bishops, the Master-General of the East, 21 counts and tribunes and 6,000 soldiers. His tomb became a major pilgrimage destination.\nA few decades following Saint Simeon's death, a large monastic church occupying over 5,000 square meters was constructed on the site where his pillar stood. The church was made up of four basilicas that emanated from the sides of a central octagon. The octagonal crossing was surmounted by a dome; at its center stood Simeon's column. The church was the centerpiece of a walled monastic complex that included two minor churches, and pilgrim hostels. In the year 638 the monastery fell into the hands of the Miaphysites, and it was destroyed by Arab tribes in the year 985.\n\nLong abandoned and ruined, the site is part of the series of ruins referred as the Dead Cities of Syria. Until just recently, remains of the pillar of Saint Simeon still stood, despite having been whittled down to a block only a few meters tall from years of pilgrims cutting down small parts for themselves as relics; substantial surviving parts of the column shaft were last visible in the 17th century. The dome above it apparently survived until the 19th century.\n\nArchitecture\nAs opposed to many of the cathedrals that were constructed in medieval Europe, the idea of the church of Saint Simeon was born and realized as one project over a short span of time. It was designed in a cruciform made up of four distinct basilica complexes. The high number of pilgrims who frequently flocked to the column of Saint Simeon to pray necessitated the construction of the church in 473 AD.\nThe ambitious plan of the church of Saint Simeon complex portrays numerous architectural designs. The fundamental concept of the three-aisled basilica can be traced to the lasting traditions of the Romans. It is reported that the main basilica and the baptistery were the first to be constructed. Subsequently, the monastery and the fixtures to the baptistery followed. Ultimately, the other parts of the complex including the colossal arch on the Via Sacra were built last in the construction process. A notable part of the church of Saint Simeon is the massive arch that is located at the beginning of the Via Sacra on the way to the cathedral on the mountain. In addition, two monasteries are visible from the church; a bazaar which is a few little housings, and a tomb chapel. The following are the numerous grouped buildings that were arranged at the complex.\n\nThe four-basilica church\nThe cross shaped church was finely preserved. Inside, the pillar of Saint Simeon is still visible, but it has been reduced to approximately 2 meters high and now resembles a boulder in the middle of the courtyard. The reduction in the length of the pillar can be attributed to many years of relic-gathering by pilgrims. The courtyard is octagonal and is bordered by four basilicas in the shape of a rood-tree and described as a four-basilica church. The idea of a crucifix was to represent the crucifixion of Jesus on the cross. The east basilica is considerably bigger than other basilicas. The more significant size can be attributed to the critical role it played in hosting key ceremonies, making it most important.\n\nThe U-shaped monastery\nBordering the south partition of the eastern basilica laid a chapel and a monastery. Originally, Deir Semaan (Simeon Monastery) bore the name of Telanissos and was established to make the most of the two productive plains that surrounded it. In the mid of the 5th century AD, the locals established a monastery on the plains and in 412 AD, Saint Simeon opted to be part of it. Later on, he left the locals to live there as he went to live in the mountain above the plains where the monastery was situated.\n\nBaptistery\nThe baptistery was located on the opposite side of the southern basilica, down the sacred road known as Via Sacra. The baptistery was constructed shortly after the construction of the main church, and it served as a crucial part of the pilgrimage complex. The design of the baptistery was often regarded to be amongst the remarkable artifacts of the Christian architecture in the entire Syria. The baptistery was constructed in two phases; the baptistery itself first and related little basilicas later. The baptistery took the form of an octagonal drum that lay on the top of the square base of the building. At some point, it was filled with a wooden roof, with shape either like a cone or dome. The inner octagon was covered in a rectangular outer building. At the far end of the chamber to the east lays a semi-circular apsidiole that encompasses a tunnel with steps heading down to its location.\n\nExtensions to the Baptistery\nThe processional route guides towards the Deir Semaan (Simeon Monastery) emanates from the western side of the baptistery. At the opening of this road is the monumental arch, which runs from the monastery in the direction of the baptistery. The location of the church on the hill provides views of the surrounding countryside.\n\nUNESCO\nAs of June 2011, the Church and surrounding village were designated by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as part of the \"Ancient Villages of Northern Syria\", a World Heritage Site.\n\nWars\nArab-Byzantine War\nThe church was negatively affected by the Arab conquest during the struggle for control of Syria between the Byzantines and the Arabs. Afterwards, the Byzantines fortified the church. The complex was attacked and conquered by the emir of Aleppo Sa'd al-Dawla, who used it as a fortress. This compromised the symbolism of the complex as a holy site but did not stop worshippers from continuing to visit the complex to worship.\n\nSyrian Civil War\nThe Syrian civil war has caused a lot of damage to the historical site in the violence between the opposing parties in the conflict. Additionally, the building has been destroyed through illegal digging and stone removal. It is one of the many ancient buildings on the Northern side of Syria which have been degraded by the conflict.  The structure has been under threat from both the Syrian and Turkish governments through their conflict over the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing. On 28 May 2015, the church was captured by the Kurdish YPG/YPJ but was subsequently lost to factions opposing the Assad government. In May 2016, the Russian Air Force attacked the church, damaging the remains of the pillar of St Simeon as well as the rest of the ruins. By 8 February 2020, the hilltop near the site was occupied by the Turkish Land Forces.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nOldest churches in the world\nHistory of Roman and Byzantine domes\n350 Maronite Martyrs\nUmar II\n\nReferences\nSources\nGary Vikan, Byzantine Pilgrimage Art, (Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 1982), 8–9.\nSimeon Citadel and Dead Cities, Suggestion to have Saint Simeon Stylites recognized as a UNESCO world heritage site, in 2006, as part of \"Simeon Citadel and Dead Cities\" project.\n\"St. Simeon Church.\" Syria Gate (accessed 2008).\nSacred Destinations\nhttps://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1348/multiple=1&unique_number=1761\n\nFurther reading\nWeitzmann, Kurt, ed., Age of spirituality: late antique and early Christian art, third to seventh century, no. 590, 1979, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, ISBN 9780870991790\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Church of Saint Simeon Stylites at Wikimedia Commons\n\n180 photographs in gallery, PBase\nGatier, P.; T.

          "content": "Maaloula (Arabic: مَعلُولَا; Western Neo-Aramaic: ܡܥܠܘܠܐ ,מעלולא, romanized: Maʿlūlā) is a town in southwestern Syria. The town is located in the Rif Dimashq Governorate and is 56 km northeast of Damascus, and is built into the rugged mountainside at an altitude of more than 1,500m. It is known as one of three remaining villages where Western Neo-Aramaic is spoken, the other two being the nearby smaller villages of Jubb'adin and Bakh'a. However, Bakh'a was vastly destroyed during the Syrian Civil War, and all the inhabitants fled to other parts of Syria or to Lebanon.\n\nEtymology\nMaʿlūlā is said to derive from the Aramaic word maʿəlā, meaning \"entrance\". The name is romanized in multiple different ways, such as Maaloula, Ma'loula, Maalula, Ma'lula, Malula. However, \"Maaloula\" is the most common one.\n\nHistory\nCivil war\nMaaloula became the scene of battle between the Al-Qaeda-linked insurgent group Al-Nusra Front and the Syrian Army in September 2013.\nThe insurgents took over the town on October 21. Around 13 people were killed, with many more wounded.\nOn October 28, government forces recaptured the town.\nMaaloula was again taken over by the Al-Nusra Front on December 3, 2013. The group took 12 Orthodox nuns as hostages. The nuns were moved between different locations and ended up in Yabroud where they were held for three months. Officials from Lebanon negotiated a deal for their release. Those negotiations produced an agreement on a prisoner exchange under which around 150 Syrian women detained by the government were also freed. After the nuns were freed on 9 March 2014, they stated that they were mostly treated well by their captors.\nOn 14 April 2014, with the help of Hezbollah and SSNP, the Syrian Army once again recaptured the town. The success of Syrian government forces in recapturing Maaloula was part of a string of other successes in the strategic Qalamoun region, including the seizure of the former rebel bastion of Yabroud in the previous month.\n\nDemographics\nIn 1838, its inhabitants were Antiochan Greek Orthodox Christians, Melkite Catholics, and a minority of Sunni Muslims. \nPresently, the population maintains religious diversity, with both Christians and Muslims identifying ethnically as Arameans Notably, the Muslim inhabitants have a remarkable legacy as they haven’t embraced an Arab ethnic identity, unlike the majority of other Syrians who underwent Islamization and, consequently, Arabization over the centuries.\nIn the middle of the 20th century, 15,000 people lived in Maaloula.\nAccording to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Maaloula had a population of 2,762 in the 2004 census. However, the population increases to about 10,000 during the summer, due to people coming from Damascus for holidays.\n\nLanguage\nWith two other nearby towns, Bakh'a and Jubb'adin, Maaloula is the only place where a Western Aramaic language is still spoken, which it has been able to retain amidst the rise of Arabic due to its distance from other major cities and its isolating geological features. However, modern roads and transportation, as well as accessibility to Arabic-language television and print media – and for some time until recently, also state policy – have eroded that linguistic heritage.\nAs the last remaining area where Western Neo-Aramaic is still spoken, the three villages represent an important source for anthropological linguistic studies regarding first century Western Aramaic. According to scholarly consensus, the language of Jesus was a Western Middle Aramaic variety, Galilean Aramaic.\n\nMonasteries\nThere are two important monasteries in Maaloula: the Melkite monastery of Mar Sarkis and the Antiochan Convent of Saint Thecla.\n\nSaint Sarkis Monastic Complex\nThe Saint Sarkis Monastic Complex of Maaloula is one of the oldest surviving monasteries in Syria. It was built on the site of a pagan temple, and has elements which go back to the fifth to sixth century Byzantine period.\nSaint Sarkis is the Aramaic name for Sergius, a Roman soldier who was executed for his Christian beliefs. This monastery still maintains its solemn historical character.\nThe monastery has two of the oldest icons in the world, one depicting the Last Supper.\n\nConvent of Saint Thecla\nThis convent holds the remains of Thecla, which the second-century Acts of Paul and Thecla accounts a noble virgin and pupil of Paul the Apostle. According to later legend not in the Acts, Thecla was being pursued by soldiers of her father to capture her because of her Christian faith. She came upon a mountain, and after praying, the mountain split open and let her escape through. The town gets its name from this gap or entrance in the mountain. However, there are many variations to this story among the residents of Maaloula.\n\nOther monasteries\nThere are also the remains of numerous monasteries, convents, churches, shrines and sanctuaries. There are some that lie in ruins, while others continue to stand, defying age. Many pilgrims come to Maaloula, both Muslim and Christian, and they go there to gain blessings and make offerings.\n\nVirgin Mary statue\nThe people of Maaloula celebrated as a new statue of Mary, mother of Jesus was erected in its centre, replacing the figure destroyed in Islamist attacks in 2013. On 13 June 2015, Syrian officials unveiled the new statue of the Virgin Mary, draped in a white robe topped with a blue shawl, her hands lifted in prayer. The fibreglass figure stood at just over 3 metres (10 feet) tall and was placed on the base of the original statue.\nThe statue is titled \"Lady of Peace\" (Arabic: سيدة السلام, romanized: sayyidat as-salām).\n\nClimate\nSister city\nBéziers,  France (2014)\n\nSee also\nWestern Neo-Aramaic\nBattle of Maaloula\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nYawna Maaloula Aramaic A non-profit educational initiative dedicated to the preservation of Aramaic - the language of Jesus - and the rich cultural heritage of Maaloula.\nA website dedicated to Maaloula\nNew York Times article on Aramaic language in Maaloula and other villages in Syria\nSyrian village clings to Aramaic language at Al Jazeera English\nAn episode from Australian program, Foreign Correspondent, about Maaloula.\nThe dialect of Maalula.

It is the home of a Greek Orthodox monastery traditionally held to have been founded by Byzantine emperor Justinian I, and where a renowned icon of the Virgin Mary is revered by Christians to this day. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Saidnaya had a population of 5,194 in the 2004 census.\n\nEtymology\nLocal tradition holds that Saydnaya means ‘Halting-place of the gazelle’.  The place-name has also been thought to mean Our Lady the New, from the Greek nea, ‘new’, and the Arabic sayyida, ‘lady’. However, the word sayd is generally related to hunting, and naya is a typical place-suffix in Syriac; therefore, Saydnaya probably means simply a hunting-place. Indeed, in ancient times, a temple of Saydoun, the Phoenician god of the hunt, stood in this once densely forested region. Under later Christian and Arabic influence, perhaps the name may have been thought to mean the ‘place of the Lady’.\nThe Hellenistic-era name for the region centered in the Barada Valley was Abilene: the local tradition has thus long held it as the site where the grave of Abel, slain brother of Cain, lies.  Scholars consider it likely that the capital of Abilene was the city of Saidnaya.\n\nOverview\nLong a center of Christian pilgrimage, pilgrims from all over the world seek Saidnaya for renewal of faith and for healing. Renowned for its faithfulness to Christianity, tradition holds that the Convent of Our Lady of Saidnaya was constructed by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I in 547 AD, after he had two visions of Mary, one that indicated where to build the church and the other outlining its design. Justinian dedicated the finished project to the feast of Mary's Nativity, and annually thereafter on September 8, and through to the present day, both Muslim and Christian pilgrims have come to commemorate the feast day of Our Lady of Saidnaya. Also located in the convent of Saidnaya is an icon of the Holy Mother and Child known as the Shaghurah and reputed to have been painted by Luke the Evangelist which is believed to protect its owners from harm in times of danger.\nDue in no small measure to its protected mountainous location, Saidnaya enjoyed religious peace throughout its history, even during times of war, such as during the Crusades. Local Muslims visit the convent sanctuary on the day of Friday prayers and share in the legends regarding this holy place. Christians and Muslims from the region and from far away places seek the shrine for healing. Numerous accounts of miraculous healings have been reported, some which are documented in writing by those who experienced them throughout history.\nSaidnaya has about more than 40 chapels and monasteries and the most famous one is the convent of the Virgin Mary. Many other Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Syriac Catholic and Syriac Orthodox churches and monasteries have been built in Saidnaya throughout history. On top of the highest mountain in Saidnaya is the Cherubim Monastery at 2,000 metres (6,561.68 feet) above sea level, overlooking Damascus' fertile plains and Lebanon's mountains. There is also the Monastery of Mar Thomas and a few massive monasteries built more recently such as St. Thomas Creek Catholic Monastery, St. Estphariuos Orthodox Monastery, and St. Ephram Syriac Monastery. A bronze statue of Jesus Christ with 33.10 m high, was installed on 14 October 2013 financed by both the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian government, The statue is near the Monastery of the Cherubim, perched above the historic pilgrimage route from Constantinople to Jerusalem.\nThe weather is cold and snowy in winter, while it is warm and has fresh air in summer. Surviving vestiges of caves, grottos and ancient places in and around Saydnaya indicate that it was inhabited by different civilizations from the early Stone Age, with artifacts from Aramaic, Greek, Syriac, Roman, and Arab times.\n\nHistory\nSaidnaya's origins are in ancient times, and the town has been inhabited since at least the sixth century BC when it was known by its Aramaic name, Danaba. It emerged as an important center of Christianity well before it was adopted as the official religion of the Roman Empire. Macarius, the first bishop of Aleppo and later the Patriarch of Antioch, lists Saidnaya in a seventeenth-century Arabic manuscript as one of the seven ancient episcopal cities under Damascus, the same cities represented at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD.\n\nIcon of the All-Holy Virgin\nIn the late 8th century, a certain venerable Marina was abbess of the convent, and she was widely revered for her piety and sanctity of life. It happened that a hermit monk, a Greek pilgrim from Egypt named Theodore, stopped at the convent on his way to the Holy Land. When he was leaving, Abbess Marina asked him to buy in Jerusalem a precious and fine icon of the Holy Virgin. While at Jerusalem, he utterly forgot the task entrusted to him and started on his return journey. However, when he had not gone far from the city, he was stopped short by an unfamiliar voice: \"Have you not forgotten something in Jerusalem? What have you done in regard to the commission from Abbess Marina?\" Monk Theodore returned at once to Jerusalem and found an icon of the Theotokos. During the journey back to the convent, he was astounded by the miracles accomplished through the icon. He and his whole caravan were ambushed by bandits, and then attacked by wild beasts. Amidst these dangers, the hermit always invoked the aid of the Holy Virgin while holding her icon, and he and all the caravan were saved from every peril.\nThese events tempted him to keep the valuable icon for himself, and he decided to bypass Saidnaya and sail back to Egypt. However, he was unable to set sail, for such a fierce storm arose, it seemed the ship would inevitably sink. His conscience was pricked, and he quickly left the ship and returned by way of Saidnaya. After spending four days in the convent, he was again possessed by an irresistible desire to make the icon of the Mother of God his own. He apologized to the abbess, pretending that he had been unable to buy the required icon, and then he decided to leave the convent secretly. The next morning, as he was about to set out on the journey back to his own country and approached the convent gate, he was amazed to find that an invisible power barred his way, and it was as though a stone wall stood where the gate should have been. After many futile attempts, he was forced to hand the icon over to the abbess, confessing his intention. With tears of gratitude she glorified the Lord and His All-pure Mother. Today the holy Icon is visited by pilgrims seeking the Virgin Mary's blessings as it is believed to grant (or at least intercede for) healing and fertility miracles. It is notable that Syrian Muslims often visit and pray before the Icon as well.\n\nConstruction of the convent\nAccording to the tradition, emperor Justinian I, while crossing Syria with his troops either on his way to the Holy Land or on a campaign against the Persians, came to this desert, where his army encamped and soon suffered thirst for lack of water. When they despaired, the emperor saw a beautiful gazelle off in the distance. He vigorously gave chase, hunting the animal until it tired and stopped on a rocky knoll and approached a spring of fresh water, but without giving the emperor the opportunity to shoot it. Suddenly, it transformed into an icon of the  Theotokos, which shone with a brilliant light. A white hand stretched forth from it and a voice said, \"No, thou shalt not kill me, Justinian, but thou shalt build a church for me here on this hill.\" Then the strange heavenly light and majestic figure disappeared. Upon his return, Justinian related what he had seen to his subordinates and ordered them immediately to draw up a plan for the contemplated church. After some time had passed and the architects were unable to resolve the problems of the plan, the Holy Virgin — the gazelle — reappeared to Justinian in a dream and confided a magnificent plan to him for a convent, of which she would be the protectress. It is said that the basic structure of the convent follows this plan to this day. The convent soon gained such renown that it came to be ranked second only to Jerusalem as a place of pilgrimage, and nuns from every corner of Syria, Egypt, and other lands flocked to it. The holy icon El Chagoura appeared many years after the convent was constructed.\nIn From the Holy Mountain, William Dalrymple notes that in Arabic, Saidnaya means both \"our lady\" and \"hunting place\", and the legend is likely related to this.\n\nCrusader period\nMagister Thietmar, a German pilgrim, wrote of his pilgrimage to Saidnaya, devoting four pages to a description of the icon of Holy Mother and Child found at the convent. He describes the origin story behind the icon and its special properties, and how a holy oil emitted from the breasts of the Virgin Mary is believed to be a miraculous oil that can heal the sick. In September 1240, after Thibaut de Champagne concluded a treaty with the sultan of Egypt, the Benedict of Alignan made a pilgrimage to St. Mary's of Saidnaya with the sultan's permission. The trip is seen as evidence of both Saidnaya's importance to Christian pilgrims in the thirteenth century and the relative safety of travel for Christians in Muslim areas during this time.\nChronicles from the thirteenth century also report that Templar Knights would go to the mountain monastery in Saidnaya to collect holy oil for Templar churches in Europe.\n\nModern era\nIn 1838, Eli Smith noted Saidanaya as being populated by Sunni Muslims and Antiochian Greek Christians. The Hollywood actor Michael Ansara was born in Saidnaya in 1922.\n\nSee also\nSednaya Prison\nChristians in Syria\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nSaidnaya.com\nSaydnayatoday.com",

          "content": "Amrit (Arabic: عمريت), the classical Marathus (Ancient Greek: Μάραθος, Marathos), was a Phoenician port located near present-day Tartus in Syria. Founded in the third millennium BC, Marat (Phoenician: 𐤌𐤓𐤕, MRT) was the northernmost important city of ancient Phoenicia, with relations to nearby Arwad. During the 2nd century BC, Amrit was defeated and its site largely abandoned, leaving its ruins well preserved and without extensive remodeling by later generations.\n\nHistory\nThe city lies on the Mediterranean coast around 6 km (3.7 mi) south of modern-day Tartus. Two rivers cross the city: Nahr Amrit, near the main temple, and Nahr al-Kuble near the secondary temple, a fact that might be linked to the importance of water in the religious traditions in Amrit. The city was probably founded by the Arvadites, and was considered one of the \"daughters of Arwad\" on the coastline. Marathus served as Arwad's continental base, although the port of Arwad in the mainland was Carne. It grew to be one of the wealthiest towns in the dominion of Arwad. The city surrendered, along with Arwad, to Alexander the Great in 333 BC. During Seleucid times the town, known as Marathus, was probably larger and more prosperous than Arwad. In 219 BC Marathus gained independence from Arwad, and was later sacked by forces from the latter city in 148 BC. Strabo described Marathus as ruins at his time.\n\nExcavation\nExcavations of the site principally began in 1860 by Ernest Renan. Excavations were again carried out in 1954 by French archaeologist Maurice Dunand. Ceramic ware finds at Amrit indicated the site had been inhabited as early as the third millennium BC. Middle and Late Bronze Age \"silo tombs\" were also excavated, with contents ranging from weapons to original human remains. Excavations at the necropolis south of the town yielded several tomb structures. The funeral art found in some tombs with pyramidal-or cube-shaped towers, is considered some of \"the most notable grave-monuments of the Phoenician world.\" Excavations also uncovered the town's ancient harbor, and a U-shaped stadium that dates back to the 4th and 3rd centuries BC and measures around 230 m (750 ft) in length.\n\nTemples\nOne of the most important excavations at Amrit was the Phoenician temple, commonly referred to the \"ma'abed,\" dedicated to the god Melqart of Tyre and Eshmun. The colonnaded temple, excavated between 1955 and 1957, consists of a large court cut out of rock measuring 47 × 49 m (154 × 161 ft) and over 3 m (9.8 ft) deep, surrounded by a covered portico. In the center of the court a well-preserved cube-shaped cella stands. The open-air courtyard was filled with the waters of a local, traditionally sacred spring, a unique feature of this site. The temple—which was dated to the late 4th century BC, a period following the Persian expansion into Syria—shows major Achaemenid influence in its layout and decoration. According to Dutch archaeologist, Peter Akkermans, the temple is the \"best-preserved monumental structure from the Phoenician homeland.\"\nA second temple, described by visitors to the site in 1743 and 1860 and thought to have disappeared, was later discovered by the Syrian archaeological mission near the Nahr al-Kuble spring.\n\nStadium\nAbout 200 m (660 ft) northeast of the main temples of ancient Marathos and 180 m (590 ft) north of the Amrit Tell are the remains of a rock-carved Phoenician stadium. It is separated from the other two archaeological sites by the Nahr al-Amrit and a site called by the locals al-Meqla '(the quarry'). The Stadium of Amrit was first described in 1745 by Richard Pococke in Part 2 of his book, A Description of the East, and Some Other Countries, as the site where an ancient Circus was held. Ernest Renan examined it in 1860 and discussed it in his book Mission de Phénicie, making the conclusion that the complex was not Roman in its entirety and that the stadium was undoubtedly Phoenician. The stadium is about 225 to 230 meters long and 30 to 40 meters wide, it has similar dimensions to the stadium of Olympia in Greece (213 × 31/32 meters). Seven rows of seats have been partially preserved. The stadium was open to the west and had two entrances on the east side between seats. In addition, there was a tunnel to the interior. The stadium is located approximately at a right angle to the main temple of Amrit, the Maabed. The temples to the north and west have open sides or which the stadium forms a common intersection. It is believed that the  Amrit stadium was the location for sacred competitions where anointing and funeral games took place. Labib Boutros, former director of athletics at the American University of Beirut has conducted recent studies of the stadium and suggested that its construction may date back as far as 1500 BC, saying that the Amrit stadium was \"devoted to sports in Phoenicia several centuries before the Olympic Games\".\n\nNecropolis\nThe Necropolis in the south of Amrit consists of underground burial chambers and two distinguishing burial towers called by the locals \"al Maghazil\" or The Spindles that stand up to 7.5 m (25 ft) high. The larger tower is composed of a square stone base with a slightly upward tapering cylindrical block with a base diameter of 3.7 m (12 ft), rising to a pyramid as a top termination, which is badly damaged. The second is approximately 12 meters southeast and is not quite 7 m (23 ft) tall. At its base are three cylindrical parts whose diameters decrease and terminate in a dome. At the lower cylinder, to the corners of the square base plates, four lions decorate the building, which may not have been completed. Excavations of the burial chambers east of the towers has uncovered finds dated back as far as the 5th century BC. Plain limestone and clay sarcophagus were found arranged in cassette-like formation within the chambers. Other tombs are located south of the Nahr al-Qubli, the \"al-Burǧ Bazzāq\" or Worm tower, a phenomenal structure that was originally 19.50 meters high and the Hypogeum \"Ḥaǧar al-Ḥublā\" with three burial chambers, which were still used in Roman times.\n\nConservation\nAmrit was included on the 2004 and 2006 World Monuments Fund watch lists of endangered archaeological sites. The Fund called attention to the site's rapid deterioration due to vandalism and encroaching development. In 2006 a three-day workshop was organized with participation from the UNESCO, Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums of Syria and local administrators responsible for the sites of Amrit, Tartus and Arwad.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nHead, Barclay; et al.

          "content": "Arwad (Phoenician: 𐤀𐤓𐤅𐤃‎, romanized: ʾRWD; Arabic: أرواد, romanized: ʾArwād), the classical Aradus, is a town in Syria on an eponymous island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is the administrative center of the Arwad Subdistrict (nahiyah), of which it is the only locality. It is the only inhabited island in Syria. It is located 3 km (1.9 mi) from Tartus (the ancient Tortosa), Syria's second-largest port.\nToday, Arwad is mainly a fishing town. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, during the 2004 census, it had a population of 4,403, predominantly Arab Sunni Muslims. Plans were unveiled in May 2016 to renovate the island to become a tourist attraction. The island is currently surrounded by ancient Phoenician era walls.\n\nEtymology\nThe original Phoenician city was named Arwad Phoenician: 𐤀𐤓𐤅𐤃‎, romanized: ʾRWD and was located on an island named (𐤀𐤉𐤍𐤊‎, ʾYNK). It is mentioned in the Annals of Thutmose III at the Karnak Temple as jrtw. It eventually became known as Arvad, Arpad, and Arphad. These were hellenized as Árados (Ancient Greek: Ἄραδος), which was Latinized as Aradus. In Arabic, it became Arwad (أرواد).\nUnder the Seleucid Empire, Antiochus I renamed it Antioch after himself or the father of Seleucus the Great. It was distinguished from several other cities of that name as Antioch or Antiochia in Pieria (Ancient Greek: Ἀντιόχεια τῆς Πιερίας, romanized: Antiókheia tês Pierías).\nIts site was also known as Ruad Island and Ile Rouad under the French occupation and mandate from 1916 to 1945. Postage stamps were issued in 1916 in the latter name.\n\nHistory\nAncient history\nArwad has been continuously inhabited since at least the 3rd millennium BC. it was mentioned in the archive of the Royal Palace of Ebla, then at Alalakh.\nThe island was settled in the early 2nd millennium BC by the Phoenicians. Located some 50 kilometres (31 mi) north of Tripolis, it was a barren rock covered with fortifications and houses several stories in height. The island was about 800 m long by 500 m wide, surrounded by a massive wall, and an artificial harbor was constructed on the east toward the mainland. It developed into a trading city in early times, as did most of the Phoenician cities on this coast. It had a powerful navy, and its ships are mentioned in the monuments of Egypt and Assyria. In the Bible, an \"Arvad\" is noted as the forefather of the \"Arvadites\", a Canaanite people. The Phoenicians collected rain water in cisterns and shipped fresh water to the island, eventually discovering an undersea freshwater spring nearby.\nThe city of Arwad seems to have had a sort of hegemony over the northern Phoenician cities, from the mouth of the Orontes to the northern limits of Lebanon, something like that of Sidon in the south. It brought under its authority some of the neighboring cities on the mainland, such as Marat (present-day Amrit) and Sumur, the former nearly opposite the island and the latter some kilometers to the south. It had its own local dynasty and coinage, and some of the names of its kings have been recovered.\n\nEgyptian Period\nThutmose III of Egypt took it in his campaign in north Syria (1472 BC), and it is noticed in the campaigns of Ramesses II in the early part of the 13th century BC.\nIt is also mentioned in the Amarna letters as being in league with the Amorites in their attacks on the Egyptian possessions in Syria.\nAbout 1200 BC or a little later, it was sacked by invaders from Asia Minor or the islands, as were most of the cities on the coast. but it recovered when they were driven back.\n\nAssyrian Period\nIts maritime importance is indicated by the inscriptions of the Assyrian kings. Tiglath-pileser I (c. 1020 BC) boasts that he sailed in the ships of Arwad. Ashurnasirpal II (c. 876 BC) made it tributary, but it revolted and 200 men of Arwad were mentioned among the allies of Hadadezer of Aram Damascus at the Battle of Qarqar, when all Syria seems to have been in league against Shalmaneser III (c. 854). At this time, the king of Arwad was Mattan Baal. It was afterward tributary to Tiglath-pileser III and Sennacherib; under Sennacherib, its king was Abd-Ilihit c. 701. Ashurbanipal (c. 664) compelled its king Yakinlu to submit and send one of his daughters to become a member of the royal harem.\n\nPersian Period\nUnder the Persians, Arwad was allowed to unite in a confederation with Sidon and Tyre, with a common council at Tripolis. The Book of Ezekiel refers to its seamen and soldiers in the service of Tyre.\n\nAlexander the Great and Hellenistic Period\nWhen Alexander the Great invaded Syria in 332 BC, the king of Arwad, Gerostratus, and his son Straton submitted to him without resistance and sent their navy to support his Siege of Tyre.It seems to have received the favor of the Seleucid kings of Syria and enjoyed the right of asylum for political refugees. It is mentioned in a rescript from Rome about 138 BC in connection with other cities and rulers of the East, to show favor to the Jews. This was after Rome had begun to interfere in the affairs of Judea and Syria and indicates that Arwad was still of considerable importance at that time.\nThe city has been cited as one of the first known examples of a republic in the Levant region, in which the people, rather than a monarch, are described as sovereign. The island was important as a base for commercial ventures into the Orontes valley.\nArwad inaugurated a new civic era in 259 BC, when its traditional royalty disappeared, and it became a free independent city within the Seleucid kingdom, during the reign of Antiochus II.\n\nRoman Period\nIn Roman times, Arwad fiercely resisted Mark Antony when he came to Syria to find money there. When the city refused to co-operate, it was besieged in 38 BC, then eventually surrendered, which marked the end of its independence in 34–35 BC.\n\nBishopric\nThe city of Aradus, as it was then called, became a Christian bishopric. Athanasius reports that, under Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, Cymatius, the Chalcedonian bishop of Aradus and also of Antaradus (whose names indicate that they were neighbouring towns facing each other) was driven out by the Arians. At the First Council of Constantinople in 381, Mocimus appears as bishop of Aradus. At the time of the Council of Ephesus (431), some sources speak of a Musaeus as bishop of Aradus and Antaradus, while others mention only Aradus or only Antaradus. Alexander was at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 as bishop of Antaradus, Paulus as bishop of Aradus, while, at a synod held at Antioch shortly before, Paulus took part as bishop of both Aradus and Antaradus.\n\nIn 458, Atticus signed, as bishop of Aradus, the letter of the bishops of the province of Phoenicia Prima to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian protesting about the murder of Proterius of Alexandria. Theodorus or Theodosius, who died in 518, is mentioned as bishop of Antaradus in a letter from the bishops of the province regarding Severus of Antioch that was read at a synod held by Patriarch Mennas of Constantinople. The acts of the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 were signed by Asyncretius as bishop of Aradus. At the time of the Crusades, Antaradus, by then called Tartus or Tortosa, was a Latin Church diocese, whose bishop also held the titles of Aradus and Maraclea (perhaps Rachlea).\nIt was united to the see of Famagusta in Cyprus in 1295. No longer a residential bishopric, Aradus is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\n\nMedieval history\nDuring the later part of the 13th century, in the time of the Crusades, the island of Ruad was used as a bridgehead or staging area by the Crusaders. It was the last piece of land that the Crusaders maintained in the Holy Land.\nThe Crusaders had lost control of the mainland in 1291 (see Fall of Acre), and the dwindling Kingdom of Jerusalem had been relocated to the island of Cyprus. In late 1300, in an attempt to coordinate military operations with the Mongol leader Ghazan, the Cypriots prepared a land-based force of approximately 600 men: 300 under Amalric of Lusignan, son of Hugh III of Cyprus, and similar contingents from the Templars and Hospitallers. The men and their horses were ferried from Cyprus to a staging area on Ruad, from which they launched raids on Tortosa while awaiting Mongol reinforcements. When the Mongols failed to arrive, the majority of the Christian forces returned to Cyprus, though a garrison was left on Ruad which was manned by rotating groups of different Cypriot forces. Pope Clement V formally awarded ownership of the island to the Knights Templar, who (in 1302) maintained a garrison with 120 knights, 500 bowmen and 400 Syrian helpers, under the Templar Maréchal (Commander-in-Chief) Barthélemy de Quincy.\nIn February 1301, the Mongols did arrive with a force of 60,000, but could do little else than engage in some raids around Syria. The Mongol leader Kutluqa stationed 20,000 horsemen in the Jordan Valley to protect Damascus, where a Mongol governor was installed. Soon however, they had to withdraw.\nThe Egyptian Mamluks, who had been systematically re-establishing control over Judea and Samaria and Syria, sought to take Ruad as well. A Mamluk fleet landed a force on the island, engaging in combat with the entrenched Templars, and then establishing a lengthy siege, culminating with the Fall of Ruad, and the Crusaders surrendering on September 26, 1302, following a promise of safe conduct. However, the promise was not honored: all the bowmen and Syrian helpers were killed, and the Templar knights were sent to Cairo prisons.\n\nContemporary era\nDuring WWI, the island was occupied by the French navy on 1 September 1915, under the leadership of Admiral Louis Dartige du Fournet, including warships such as Jauréguiberry, Jeanne d'Arc and D'Estrées. Later on, Albert Trabaud was appointed as its governor. Afterwards, the island was bombed by the Ottomans in November 1917, but their attack was repulsed by French sailors.\nUnder the French Mandate the dungeons of the fortress were used as a prison for those opposing French rule, as the captives' still-visible graffiti attest.\nIn 1945, at the end of WWII, France wanted to preserve the island, hence started working to build a military base, in a geopolitical framework, to maintain a military position in the region, and to keep a cultural influence. But as a result of pressure from the United States, the island was ceded unconditionally to Syria at the end of 1945, a decision confirmed in 1946.\nDuring the later half of the 20th century and the 21st century, the island's economy became more reliant on tourism, fishing and boatbuilding. This tourism focused economy was greatly impacted by the Syrian Civil War, due to the decreased travel to Syria. However, there has been no conflict on the island during the war, and it has been controlled by government forces from the beginning of the war until the Fall of the Assad regime on December 8, 2024. Despite this, at least 20 islanders have lost their life in the course of the war. The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected the island's economy, further weakening the tourism industry, with many local businesses losing potential tourist related income.\n\nSee also\nArad, Bahrain\nArvada, Colorado\nCities of the ancient Near East\nList of Crusader castles\nList of islands of Syria\n\nReferences and sources\nReferences\nSources\nMalcolm Barber, Trial of the Templars\nMartin Bernal, Black Athena Writes Back (Durham: Duke University Press, 2001), 359.\nLawrence I Conrad, ‘The Conquest of Arwād: A Source-critical study in the historiography of the early medieval Near East’, in The Byzantine and early Islamic Near East: Papers of the First Workshop on Late Antiquity and Early Islam, edited by Averil Cameron and Lawrence I Conrad, Studies in late antiquity and early Islam, 1, vol. 1, Problems in the literary source material (Princeton: Darwin Press, 1992), 317–401.\nAlain Demurger, The Last Templar\nHazlitt, The Classical Gazetteer, p. 53.\nLebling, Robert W. 2016. \"Arwad, Fortress at Sea\".

It was built by the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in 728-29 CE in an area rich in desert fauna. It was apparently used as a military and hunting outpost. The palace is the counterpart of Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi, a nearby castle palace built one year earlier. It is one of the so-called desert castles.\n\nLocation\nQasr al-Hayr al-Sharq is 28 kilometres (17 mi) from Al-Sukhnah and 100 kilometres (62 mi) from Sergiopolis (Rusafa), near Bishri Mountain near Palmyran Middle Mountains.\n\nSyrian Civil War\nDuring Syria Civil War, Qasr al-Hayr al-Sharqi was captured by armed groups in 2013, then by ISIS. The Castle has been damaged by looting and vandalism. The visitor house has been burgled. The Syrian Army recaptured the castle on 22 August 2017.\n\nArchitecture\nLike other Umayyad architectural works, the construction style was influenced by Byzantine and Sasanian architectures.\nThe palace consists of a large open courtyard surrounded by thick bulwarks and towers guarding the entrances and each corner. The ruins consist of three main components, known as the Small Enclosure, the Large Enclosure and the Outer Enclosure, each of which differ in form and function. The palace(s) contains remnants of rooms, arches and columns which seem to be parts of a huge royal complex, including smaller structures, a reception hall, a mosque, a large bathhouse, gardens, courtyards and a complex water control system. Believed to each be made of a fine-grained limestone with an amber tint, these structures are each complex and visually stunning. In addition to the using stone, these towers exhibit a unique and charming decorative design, using brick and stucco. The bigger palace has been several floors, with a huge gate and many towers. Towers were not built as defensive measures. There were also olive yards. The palaces were supplied with water by nearby Byzantine church by a canal 5,700 metres (6,200 yd) long.\nQasr al-Hayr al-Sharqi was ultimately abandoned at the start of the fourteenth century, resulting in an unprecedented opportunity to study urban life, order and planning during the early Islamic period. The site was excavated in six seasons between 1964 and 1971 by renowned Islamic art historian Oleg Grabar. Excavation of this site provided a unique example for historians and archaeologists of the ecological developments and decorative elements and materials of the area, such as ceramics and coins. Some of the decorated parts have been moved to the National Museum of Damascus while the gate has been reconstructed in the Deir ez-Zor Museum.\n\nWorld Heritage Status\nThis site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on June 8, 1999, in the Cultural category.\n\nGallery\nSee also\n\nDesert castles\nList of castles in Syria",

          "content": "Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi (Arabic: قصر الحير الغربي) is a Syrian desert castle or qasr located 80 km south-west of Palmyra on the Damascus road. The castle is a twin palace of Qasr al-Hayr al-Sharqi, built by the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in 727 CE.  It was built in the Umayyad architectural style. As the complex was believed to be an estate owned by someone of wealth, it is no surprise that some decorations for its opulent owners may be found within the remains of the palace. Some of the items found within include richly decorated floor frescoes, stucco walls, and figural reliefs. Many decorations and artwork from the complex are kept at the National Museum in Damascus. Like other desert palaces, Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi was not Hisham's primary residence. The structure served as a secondary lodging for the Caliph, while the expanse of flat desert land surrounding it was used for leisurely activities such as hunting and racing. Noblemen other than the Caliph would have stayed in tents around the palace when they visited.\n\nDescription\nQasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi is one of a number of Umayyad desert castles in the Syrian/Jordanian region. The site originally consisted of a palace complex, a bath house, industrial buildings for the production of olive oil, an irrigated garden and another building which scholars suggest may have been a caravanserai. Over the entrance is an inscription which declares that it was built by Hisham in the year 727, a claim that is borne out by the architectural style.\nIt was used as an eye of the king during the Umayyad era, to control the movement of the desert tribes and to act as a barrier against marauding tribes, as well as serving a hunting lodge. It is one of the most luxurious examples of a desert palace. Later it was utilized by the Ayyubids and the Mamelukes but was abandoned permanently after the Mongol invasions.\nThe palace was built from mudbricks atop a masonry base, at the time of excavation the only part visible was the gateway. The gateway is composed of the doorway framed by two large cylindrical structures, two small windows sit around the halfway point between the doors and the top of the gateway and the whole structure is decorated with arches and geometric patterns. Most of the mud brick degraded into the surrounding sand, but the masonry base indicates where the walls of the palace once stood. The walls formed a large rectangle and in addition to the gate there are three cylindrical towers at the corners of the structure and on the fourth stands the monastery tower. The palace was two stories high and there is evidence that there were two staircases, both levels were likely identical, divided into six sections each with a hallway, several rooms, and a lavatory.\n\nThe castle is quadrangular in outline with 70-metre (230 ft) sides. The central doorway to the castle is very attractive and has been moved to the National Museum of Damascus to be used as the entrance. Its semi-cylindrical towers on the sides of the doorway, columns, and the geometric shapes mirrored a blend of Persian, Byzantine and Arab architecture.\nLittle of the original castle remains; however, the reservoir to collect water from Harbaka dam, a bath and a khan are still visible. The gateway is preserved as a façade in the National Museum of Damascus.\n\nArt found within the complex\nAlthough the site of the complex features degrading architecture, several artistic works have been located, including a stucco wall and a fresco floor. Similar types of art can be found in Roman architecture, but the majority of works within the complex are dated in the Umayyad period, not Roman, excluding a few constructs within the waterworks. Many of the pieces found are vague or unclear whether they are based on an actual figure.\nOne piece of artwork can possibly be identified, among the reliefs discovered in a 1936 excavation of the complex, a figural relief of man, now missing from the torso and above. This finely adorned figure in Persian dress and jewelry may represent Hisham, the Caliph who commissioned the palace to be built. The relief's clothing is similar in style to various artworks created in the Sassanian period, found on dinnerware and household items. This continuation of style suggests that pre-Islamic artwork may have been an inspiration for the Umayyad palace. There is also evidence that the relief would have been painted rather than left in simple bare stone. This attempt to create artwork inspired by previous cultures is not uncommon in Islamic works, especially in the Umayyad period, as imagery depicting Sasanian mythological creatures such as senmurv's can be found at Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi as well as more well-known complexes such as Khirbat al-Mafjar.\nTwo floor frescos were also recovered from the site. One features a hunter, similar to Sassanian depictions of kings during royal hunts, as well as depictions of two court minstrels playing musical instruments, a nai (a woodwind instrument) and an oud (a string instrument), beneath a pair of ornamented arches. The hunter is dressed in Sassanian-style fashion; his head-scarf flying behind him, and his bow and arrow are drawn tight for the shot. The human figures at the top and bottom of this floor painting are shown in a realistic way, adapted from Greco-Roman models. Unlike other works found within the palace, this fresco does not a feature an insignia representing the royal family. Several scholars suggest that this fresco reflect's the Caliph’s choice to shift the focus of the empire to the East instead of the West, particularly following Muslim attempts to conquer Constantinople. This is perhaps why the Caliph chose to embrace Sassanian imperial heritage as models for asserting power. This painting was originally on the floor of a reception hall, and there are traces of a possible round column that once stood on top of it.\nThe second floor painting, painted with the fresco secco technique, was also originally in the reception hall of the west wing of Qusayr al-Hayr al-Gharbi, and measures 5.21m long by 4.43 m wide. It depicts the classical female personification of the Earth, known as Ge or Gaia, in a central red medallion, which dominates the composition. Gaia looks directly at viewers, and is wearing a necklace around her neck, and she is holding up a cloth in her hands that holds fruit. The painting appears to draw inspiration from Byzantine mosaics, of which painting is a less time consuming and costly art form. Above her are nearly symmetrical hybrid creatures (Greek centaurs) who are holding a spear in one hand and motioning towards Gaia with the other, drawing our focus to her. All of the figures are surrounded by scrolling tendrils and enclosed by a red rectangular border. Outside of this border is a band of circular shapes, which mimic the band surrounding Gaia, vines (Roman acanthus) intertwining, and what appear to be grapes. Despite the right side of the floor being worn away, the piece appears to be almost symmetrical based on the outlines left behind. These shapes are then enclosed by a thin black rectangle and ultimately a red border, giving this painting a carpet-like appearance. Although few examples survive from this period, the importance of textiles in the Islamic world is suggested in this painting, and the influence of Greek, Byzantine, and Roman culture is made clear in the layout and imagery of the piece. In the lower areas of this painting there are animals including cranes, foxes, and a dog. It was quite common for Umayyad and early Abbasid artists to reflect Greco-Roman conventions, which is evident in this painting. The imagery in this painting, such as Gaia holding the fruit in a cloth and the centaurs with weapons may reflect the common pursuits of those living in desert castles, such as feasting and hunting. Since she is a direct reference to the Earth and heaven, she might also serve as a personification of abundance and the agricultural fertility that rulers such as caliph Hisham \"interpreted as a divine portent of their political legitimacy.\"\nThe desert castles like Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi were used as temporary retreats, sites to display status, and for Umayyad rulers to entertain their guests. Floor paintings like these helped create an atmosphere of sophistication and luxury for whoever saw them.\nBoth paintings have been removed from their original location in Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi and are now at the National Museum of Damascus.\n\nSee also\nDesert castles\nIslamic art\nIslamic architecture\nList of castles in Syria\nUmayyad architecture\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n\"Qasr Al Hir\".

          "title": "Tell Brak",
          "content": "Tell Brak (Nagar, Nawar) was an ancient city in Syria; it is one the earliest known cities in the world. Its remains constitute a tell located in the Upper Khabur region, near the modern village of Tell Brak, 50 kilometers north-east of Al-Hasaka city, Al-Hasakah Governorate. The city's original name is unknown. During the second half of the third millennium BC, the city was known as Nagar and later on, Nawar.\nStarting as a small settlement in the seventh millennium BC, Tell Brak's urbanization began in the late 5th millennium BCE and evolved during the fourth millennium BC into one of the biggest cities in Upper Mesopotamia, and interacted with the cultures of southern Mesopotamia. The city shrank in size at the beginning of the third millennium BC with the end of Uruk period, before expanding again around 2600 BC, when it became known as Nagar, and was the capital of a regional kingdom that controlled the Khabur river valley. Nagar was destroyed around 2300 BC, and came under the rule of the Akkadian Empire, followed by a period of independence as a Hurrian city-state, before contracting at the beginning of the second millennium BC. Nagar prospered again by the 19th century BC, and came under the rule of different regional powers. In c. 1500 BC, Tell Brak was a center of Mitanni before being destroyed by Assyria around 1300 BC. The city never regained its former importance, remaining as a small settlement, and abandoned at some points of its history, until disappearing from records during the early Abbasid era.\nDifferent peoples inhabited the city, including the Halafians, Semites and the Hurrians. Tell Brak was a religious center from its earliest periods; its famous Eye Temple is unique in the Fertile Crescent, and its main deity, Belet Nagar, was revered in the entire Khabur region, making the city a pilgrimage site. The culture of Tell Brak was defined by the different civilizations that inhabited it, and it was famous for its glyptic style, equids and glass. When independent, the city was ruled by a local assembly or by a monarch. Tell Brak was a trade center due to its location between Anatolia, the Levant and southern Mesopotamia. It was excavated by Max Mallowan in 1937, then regularly by different teams between 1979 and 2011, when the work stopped due to the Syrian Civil War.\n\nName\nThe original name of the city is unknown; Tell Brak is the current name of the tell. East of the mound lies a dried lake named \"Khatuniah\" which was recorded as \"Lacus Beberaci\" (the lake of Brak) in the Roman map Tabula Peutingeriana. The lake was probably named after Tell Brak which was the nearest camp in the area. The name \"Brak\" might therefore be an echo of the most ancient name.\n\nDuring the third millennium BC, the city was known as \"Nagar\", which might be of Semitic origin and mean a \"cultivated place\". The name \"Nagar\" ceased occurring following the Old Babylonian period, however, the city continued to exist as Nawar, under the control of Hurrian state of Mitanni. Hurrian kings of Urkesh took the title \"King of Urkesh and Nawar\" in the third millennium BC.\n\nAlternative theories\nAlthough there is general view that the third millennium BC Nawar is identical with Nagar, some scholars, such as Jesper Eidem, doubt this. Those scholars opt for a city closer to Urkesh which was also called Nawala/Nabula as the intended Nawar.\n\nHistory\nEarly settlement\nIn Brak Period A (c. 6500–5900 BC), the earliest small settlement is dated to the proto Halaf culture c. 6500 BC. Many objects dated to that period were discovered including the Halaf pottery.\nIn Brak Period B (c. 5900–5200 BC), the Halaf Culture  Halaf culture transformed into Period C (c. 5200–4400 BC) Northern Ubaid, and many Ubaid materials were found in Tell Brak. Excavations and surface survey of the site and its surroundings, unearthed a large platform of patzen bricks that dates to late Ubaid, and revealed that Tell Brak developed as an urban center slightly earlier than better known cities of southern Mesopotamia, such as Uruk.\n\nLate Chalcolithic\nThe first city\nIn southern Mesopotamia, the original Ubaid culture evolved into the Uruk period. The people of the southern Uruk period used military and commercial means to expand the civilization. In Northern Mesopotamia, the post Ubaid period is designated Late Chalcolithic / Northern Uruk period, during which, Tell Brak started to expand.\n\nBrak Period E\nTell Brak Period E (c. 4200–3900 BC; Late Chalcolithic 2; Northern Early Uruk Period) witnessed the building of the City's Walls, and expansion beyond the mound to form a Lower Town, becoming a proto-urban city with a size of c. 55 hectares.\nComparison can be made with Hamoukar in LC1-2 period, where the early urban settlement has been described as \"a vast low or flat scatter of pottery and obsidian\". The population density at both settlements was very low at that stage, so they appeared more like a scattering of various small sites in the same area: \"... new indicators of social complexity appeared simultaneously with dramatic settlement expansion at Brak and Khirbat al-Fakhar [Hamoukar], although not in the form known from later periods of northern Mesopotamian history. Both were extensive \"proto-urban\" settlements of low or variable density, with few other parallels elsewhere in the Near East.\" Another example is, Khirbat al-Fakhar already reached a massive size of 300 ha, or larger than the contemporary Uruk, itself.\nArea TW of the tell (Archaeologists divided Tell Brak into areas designated with Alphabetic letters. See the map for Tell Brak's areas) revealed the remains of a monumental building with two meters thick walls and a basalt threshold. In front of the building, a sherd paved street was discovered, leading to the northern entrance of the city. Area TW covered an area of nearly 600 square meters up to a depth of 10 meters. A number of beveled rim bowls diagnostic of the Uruk period were found in the TW area.\n\nBrak Period F\nTell Brak Period F can be subdivided into two phases early (c. 3800–3600 BC; Late Chaltolihic 3) and late (c. 3600–3000 BC; Late Chaltolihic 4).\nIn the Early Brak Period F (c. 3800–3600 BC; LC3), the early city-state continued to expand and reached the size of 130 hectares. Four mass graves, mainly sub-adults and young adults were discovered in the submound, Tell Majnuna (built entirely of rubbish over two centuries), north of the main tell, and they suggest that the process of urbanization was accompanied by internal social stress, and an increase in the organization of warfare. The first half of period F (designated LC3), saw the erection of the Eye Temple, which was named for the thousands of small alabaster \"Eye idols\" and \"Spectacle-topped idols\" figurines discovered in it. Those idols were also found in area TW.\nIn Late Brak Period F (c. 3600–3000 BC; LC4) interatction with Southern Mesopotamia increased, and an Urukean colony was established in the city. With the end of Uruk culture c 3000 BC, Tell Brak's Urukean colony was abandoned and deliberately leveled by its occupants.\n\nBrak Period G & H\nThe Brak Period G (c. 3200–3000 BC; LC5), saw the site contracting during the following periods H and J, and became limited to the mound. In the Brak Period H (c. 3000–2900 BC; Post-Uruk), evidence exists for an interaction with the Mesopotamian south, represented by the existence of materials similar to the ones produced during the southern Jemdet Nasr period.\n\nEarly Bronze\nBrak Period J & K\nDuring the Brak Period J (2900–2600 BC) and K (2600–2400 BC) the city remained a small settlement during the Ninevite 5 period, with a small temple and associated sealing activities.\n\nKingdom of Nagar\nAround c. 2600 BC, a large administrative building was built and the city expanded out of the tell again. The revival is connected with the Kish civilization, and the city was named \"Nagar\". Amongst the important buildings dated to the kingdom, is an administrative building or temple named the \"Brak Oval\", located in area TC. The building had a curved exterior wall reminiscent of the Khafajah \"Oval Temple\" in central Mesopotamia. However, aside from the wall, the comparison between the two buildings in terms of architecture is difficult, as each building follows a different plan.\nThe oldest references to Nagar comes from Mari and tablets discovered at Nabada. However, the most important source on Nagar comes from the archives of Ebla. Most of the texts record the ruler of Nagar using his title \"En\", without mentioning a name. However a text from Ebla mentions Mara-Il, a king of Nagar; thus, he is the only ruler known by name for pre-Akkadian Nagar and ruled a little more than a generation before the kingdom's destruction.\nAt its height, Nagar encompassed most of the southwestern half of the Khabur Basin, and was a diplomatic and political equal of the Eblaite and Mariote states. The kingdom included at least 17 subordinate cities, such as Hazna, and most importantly Nabada, which was a city-state annexed by Nagar, and served as a provincial capital. Nagar was involved in the wide diplomatic network of Ebla, and the relations between the two kingdoms involved both confrontations and alliances. A text from Ebla mentions a victory of Ebla's king (perhaps Irkab-Damu) over Nagar. However, a few years later, a treaty was concluded, and the relations progressed toward a dynastic marriage between princess Tagrish-Damu of Ebla, and prince Ultum-Huhu, Nagar's monarch's son.\nNagar was defeated by Mari in year seven of the Eblaite vizier Ibrium's term, causing the blockage of trade routes between Ebla and southern Mesopotamia via upper Mesopotamia. Later, Ebla's king Isar-Damu concluded an alliance with Nagar and Kish against Mari, and the campaign was headed by the Eblaite vizier Ibbi-Sipish, who led the combined armies to victory in a battle near Terqa. Afterwards, the alliance attacked the rebellious Eblaite vassal city of Armi. Ebla was destroyed approximately three years after Terqa's battle, and soon after, Nagar followed in c. 2300 BC. Large parts of the city were burned, an act attributed either to Mari, or Sargon of Akkad.\n\nAkkadian period\nFollowing its destruction, Nagar was rebuilt by the Akkadian empire, to form a center of the provincial administration. The city included the whole tell and a lower town at the southern edge of the mound. Two public buildings were built during the early Akkadian periods, one complex in area SS, and another in area FS. The building of area FS included its own temple and might have served as a caravanserai, being located near the northern gate of the city. The temple was dedicated to the god Šamagan, god of animals of the steppe. The early Akkadian monarchs were occupied with internal conflicts, and Tell Brak was temporarily abandoned by Akkad at some point preceding the reign of Naram-Sin. The abandonment might be connected with an environmental event, that caused the desertification of the region.\nThe destruction of Nagar's kingdom created a power vacuum in the Upper Khabur. The Hurrians, formerly concentrated in Urkesh, took advantage of the situation to control the region as early as Sargon's latter years. Tell Brak was known as \"Nawar\" for the Hurrians, and kings of Urkesh took the title \"King of Urkesh and Nawar\", first attested in the seal of Urkesh's king Atal-Shen.\nThe use of the title continued during the reigns of Atal-Shen's successors, Tupkish and Tish-Atal, who ruled only in Urkesh. The Akkadians under Naram-Sin incorporated Nagar firmly into their empire. The most important Akkadian building in the city is called the \"Palace of Naram-Sin\", which had parts of it built over the original Eye Temple. Despite its name, the palace is closer to a fortress, as it was more of a fortified depot for the storage of collected tribute rather than a residential seat. The palace was burned during Naram-Sin's reign, perhaps by a Lullubi attack, and the city was burned toward the end of the Akkadian period c. 2193 BC, probably by the Gutians.\n\nPost-Akkadian kingdom\nIn Brak Period N, the Fall of the Akkadian Empire (c. 2154 BC), saw Nagar becoming a center of an independent Hurrian dynasty, evidenced by the discovery of a seal, recording the name of king Talpus-Atili of Nagar, who ruled during or slightly after the reign of Shar-Kali-Sharri (r. 2217–2193 BC).\n\nUr III Dynasty?\nThe view that Tell Brak came under the control of Ur III is refused, and evidence exists for a Hurrian rebuilding of Naram-Sin's palace, erroneously attributed by Max Mallowan to Ur-Nammu of Ur. Period N saw a reduction in the city's size, with public buildings being abandoned, and the lower town evacuated. Few short lived houses were built in area CH during period N, and although greatly reduced in size, archaeology provided evidence for continued occupation in the city, instead of abandonment.\n\nMiddle Bronze\nMari Period\nDuring Brak Period P (c. 1820–1550 BC; MB II), Nagar was densely populated in the northern ridge of the tell. The city came under the rule of Mari, and was the site of a decisive victory won by Yahdun-Lim of Mari over Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria. Nagar lost its importance and came under the rule of Kahat in the 18th century BC.\n\nLate Bronze\nMitanni Period\nDuring period Q, Tell Brak was an important trade city in the Mitanni state. A two-story palace was built c. 1500 BC in the northern section of the tell, in addition to an associated temple. However, the rest of the tell was not occupied, and a lower town extended to the north but is now all but destroyed through modern agriculture. Two Mitannian legal documents, bearing the names of kings Artashumara and Tushratta (c. 1380–1345 BC), were recovered from the city.\n\nAssyrian period\nFollowing the death of king Tushratta, the Mitanni Empire collapsed. In the west the Hittites came and created a vassal buffer state in the region of Hanigalbat, while the Assyrians later took territory from the east. Tell Brak was destroyed between c.1300 and 1275 BC, in two waves, first at the hands of the Assyrian king Adad-Nirari I (r. 1305–1274 BC), then by his successor Shalmaneser I.\n\nIron Age\nLittle evidence of an occupation on the tell exists following the destruction of the Mitannian city, however, a series of small villages existed in the lower town during the Assyrian periods. The remains of a Hellenistic settlement were discovered on a nearby satellite tell, to the northwestern edge of the main tell. However, excavations recovered no ceramics of the Parthian-Roman or Byzantine-Sasanian periods, although sherds dating to those periods are noted. In the middle of the first millennium AD, a fortified building was erected in the northeastern lower town. The building was dated by Antoine Poidebard to the Justinian era (sixth century AD), on the basis of its architecture. The last occupation period of the site was during the early Abbasid Caliphate's period, when a canal was built to provide the town with water from the nearby Jaghjagh River.\n\nSociety\nPeople and language\nThe Halafians were the indigenous people of Neolithic northern Syria, who later adopted the southern Ubaidian culture. Contact with the Mesopotamian south increased during the early and middle Northern Uruk period, and southern people moved to Tell Brak in the late Uruk period, forming a colony, which produced a mixed society. The Urukean colony was abandoned by the colonists toward the end of the fourth millennium BC, leaving the indigenous Tell Brak a much contracted city. The pre-Akkadian kingdom's population was Semitic, and spoke its own East Semitic dialect of the Eblaite language used in Ebla and Mari. The Nagarite dialect is closer to the dialect of Mari rather than that of Ebla.\nNo Hurrian names are recorded in the pre-Akkadian period, although the name of prince Ultum-Huhu is difficult to understand as Semitic. During the Akkadian period, both Semitic and Hurrian names were recorded, as the Hurrians appear to have taken advantage of the power vacuum caused by the destruction of the pre-Akkadian kingdom, in order to migrate and expand in the region. The post-Akkadian period Tell Brak had a strong Hurrian element, and Hurrian named rulers, although the region was also inhabited by Amorite tribes. A number of the Amorite Yaminite tribes settled the surroundings of Tell Brak during the reign of Zimri-Lim of Mari, and each group used its own language (Hurrian and Amorite languages). Tell Brak was a center of the Hurrian-Mitannian empire, which had Hurrian as its official language. However, Akkadian was the region's international language, evidenced by the post-Akkadian and Mitannian eras tablets, discovered at Tell Brak and written in Akkadian.\n\nReligion\nThe findings in the Eye Temple indicate that Tell Brak is among the earliest sites of organized religion in northern Mesopotamia. It is unknown to which deity the Eye Temple was dedicated, and the \"Eyes\" figurines appears to be votive offerings to that unknown deity. The temple was probably dedicated for the Sumerian Innana or the Semitic Ishtar; Michel Meslin hypothesized that the \"Eyes\" figurines were a representation of an all-seeing female deity.\nDuring the pre-Akkadian kingdom's era, Hazna, an old cultic center of northern Syria, served as a pilgrimage center for Nagar. The Eye Temple remained in use, but as a small shrine, while the goddess Belet Nagar became the kingdom's paramount deity. The temple of Belet Nagar is not identified but probably lies beneath the Mitannian palace. The Eblaite deity Kura was also venerated in Nagar, and the monarchs are attested visiting the temple of the Semitic deity Dagon in Tuttul. During the Akkadian period, the temple in area FS was dedicated to the Sumerian god Shakkan, the patron of animals and countrysides. Tell Brak was an important religious Hurrian center, and the temple of Belet Nagar retained its cultic importance in the entire region until the early second millennium BC.\n\nCulture\nNorthern Mesopotamia evolved independently from the south during the Late Chalcolithic / early and middle Northern Uruk (4000–3500 BC). This period was characterized by a strong emphasis on holy sites, among which, the Eye Temple was the most important in Tell Brak. The building containing \"Eyes\" idols in area TW was wood paneled, whose main room had been lined with wooden panels. The building also contained the earliest known semi columned facade, which is a character that will be associated with temples in later periods.\nBy late Northern Uruk and especially after 3200 BC, northern Mesopotamia came under the full cultural dominance of the southern Uruk culture, which affected Tell Brak's architecture and administration. The southern influence is most obvious in the level named the \"Latest Jemdet Nasr\" of the Eye Temple, which had southern elements such as cone mosaics. The Uruk presence was peaceful as it is first noted in the context of feasting; commercial deals during that period were traditionally ratified through feasting. The excavations in area TW revealed feasting to be an important local habit, as two cooking facilities, large amounts of grains, skeletons of animals, a domed backing oven and barbequing fire pits were discovered. Among the late Uruk materials found at Tell Brak is a standard text for educated scribes (the \"Standard Professions\" text), part of the standardized education taught in the 3rd millennium BC over a wide area of Syria and Mesopotamia.\n\nThe pre-Akkadian kingdom was famed for its acrobats, who were in demand in Ebla and trained local Eblaite entertainers. The kingdom also had its own local glyptic style called the \"Brak Style\", which was distinct from the southern sealing variants, employing soft circled shapes and sharpened edges. The Akkadian administration had little effect on the local administrative traditions and sealing style, and Akkadian seals existed side by side with the local variant. The Hurrians employed the Akkadian style in their seals, and Elamite seals were discovered, indicating an interaction with the western Iranian Plateau.\nTell Brak provided great knowledge on the culture of Mitanni, which produced glass using sophisticated techniques, that resulted in different varieties of multicolored and decorated shapes. Samples of the elaborate Nuzi ware were discovered, in addition to seals that combine distinctive Mitannian elements with the international motifs of that period.\nPrior to the Nuzi ware, the predominant ceramic tradition at Brak is known as Khabur ware. Nuzi ware retains some shapes of Khabur ware, as well as some of its surface decorations. The fourth and last phase of Khabur ware (around 1500 BC) is generally contemporaneous with Nuzi ware. Both of them occur in parallel for some time at Brak before the Khabur ware disappears.\n\nWagons\nSeals from Tell Brak and Nabada dated to the pre-Akkadian kingdom, revealed the use of four-wheeled wagons and war carriages. Excavation in area FS recovered clay models of equids and wagons dated to the Akkadian and post-Akkadian periods. The models provide information about the types of wagons used during that period (2350–2000 BC), and they include four wheeled vehicles and two types of two wheeled vehicles; the first is a cart with fixed seats and the second is a cart where the driver stands above the axle. The chariots were introduced during the Mitanni era, and none of the pre-Mitanni carriages can be considered chariots, as they are mistakenly described in some sources.\n\nGovernment\nThe first city had the characteristics of large urban centers, such as monumental buildings, and seems to have been ruled by a kinship based assembly, headed by elders. The pre-Akkadian kingdom was decentralized, and the provincial center of Nabada was ruled by a council of elders, next to the king's representative. The Nagarite monarchs had to tour their kingdom regularly in order to assert their political control. During the early Akkadian period, Nagar was administrated by local officials. However, central control was tightened and the number of Akkadian officials increased, following the supposed environmental event that preceded the construction of Naram-Sin's palace. The post-Akkadian Nagar was a city-state kingdom, that gradually lost its political importance during the early second millennium BC, as no evidence for a king dating to that period exists.\n\nRulers of Tell Brak\nEconomy\nThroughout its history, Tell Brak was an important trade center; it was an entrepot of obsidian trade during the Chalcolithic, as it was situated on the river crossing between Anatolia, the Levant and southern Mesopotamia. The countryside was occupied by smaller towns, villages and hamlets, but the city's surroundings were empty within three kilometers. This was probably due to the intensive cultivation in the immediate hinterland, in order to sustain the population. The city manufactured different objects, including chalices made of obsidian and white marble, faience, flint tools and shell inlays. However, evidence exists for a slight shift in production of goods toward manufacturing objects desired in the south, following the establishment of the Uruk colony.\nTrade was also an important economic activity for the pre-Akkadian kingdom of Nagar, which had Ebla and Kish as major partners. The kingdom produced glass, wool, and was famous for breeding and trading in the Kunga, a hybrid of a jenny (a female donkey) and a male Syrian wild ass. Tell Brak remained an important commercial center during the Akkadian period, and was one of Mitanni's main trade cities. Many objects were manufactured in Mitannian Tell Brak, including furniture made of ivory, wood and bronze, in addition to glass. The city provided evidence for the international commercial contacts of Mitanni, including Egyptian, Hittite and Mycenaean objects, some of which were produced in the region to satisfy the local taste.\n\nEquids\nThe kungas of pre-Akkadian Nagar were used for drawing the carriages of kings before the domestication of the horse, and a royal procession included up to fifty animals. The kungas of Nagar were in great demand in the Eblaite empire; they cost two kilos of silver, fifty times the price of a donkey, and were imported regularly by the monarchs of Ebla to be used as transport animals and gifts for allied cities. The horse was known in the region during the third millennium BC, but was not used as a draught animal before c. 18th century BC.\n\nDonkey burials\nBurials of a donkey and a dog were found at Tell Brak as early as the Akkadian period (2580–2455 BCE). They were not accompanied by human interment. Six donkey skeletons and one canine skeleton were found; they were buried below a temple courtyard.\nAlso, later, during the Babylonian period, they were found at Tell Ababra in Iraq. Tell Ababra was located in the Hamrin Basin area of Iraq, which is now covered by Lake Hamrin.\nAt Tel 'Akko (near Acre, Israel), a donkey was found buried together with a dog, and a part of the upper jawbone of a pig. The burial was dated at the end of the Middle Bronze Age.\nSimilar sacrifices of donkeys were also found in large numbers at Tell el-Dab'a in the Nile Delta of Egypt dating to the Middle Bronze Age. Also, similar sacrifices were found at Tel Haror.\n\nSite\nSoundings were conducted in 1930 by Antoine Poidebard although little was published. After a survey of the area in 1934, Tell Brak was excavated for three seasons by the British archaeologist Sir Max Mallowan, husband of Agatha Christie, in 1937 and 1938. The artifacts from Mallowan's excavations are now preserved in the Ashmolean Museum, National Museum of Aleppo and the British Museum's collection; the latter contain the Tell Brak Head dating to c. 3500–3300 BC. Two small cuneiform tablets were found and a half dozen fragments, all in the Akkadian period script.\nA team from the Institute of Archaeology of the University of London, led by David and Joan Oates, worked in the tell for 14 seasons between 1976 and 1993. Finds included several Uruk Period numerical tablets and a number of cuneiform tablets and inscriptions. After 1993, excavations were conducted by a number of field directors under the general guidance of David (until 2004) and Joan Oates. Those directors included Roger Matthews (in 1994–1996), for the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research of the University of Cambridge; Geoff Emberling (in 1998–2002) and Helen McDonald (in 2000–2004), for the British Institute for the Study of Iraq and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Finds included a large cache of carnelian, gold, silver, and lapis lazuli beads, late 3rd millennium arrowheads, stone maceheads, a range of ceramic wares, and an alabaster statuette of a seated bear.\n\nIn 2006, Augusta McMahon became field director, also sponsored by the British Institute for the Study of Iraq. A regional archaeological field survey in a 20 km (12 mi) radius around Brak was supervised by Henry T. Wright (in 2002–2005). The survey data was combined with LANDSAT and 1960s era CORONA satellite images as well as historical photographs. Many of the finds from the excavations at Tell Brak are on display in the Deir ez-Zor Museum. A number of Proto-Literate clay tokens were found at the site, mainly in Uruk leveling fill but in one case in a stratified context. Most of the finds were pellets but also cones, discs, and ovioid bullae. In Late Uruk fill a number of large stone spheres and polished teardrops were found.\nThe most recent excavations took place in the spring of 2011, but archaeological work is currently suspended due to the ongoing Syrian Civil War. According to the Syrian authorities, the camp of archaeologists was looted, along with the tools and ceramics kept in it. The site changed hands between the different combatants, mainly the Kurdish People's Protection Units and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In early 2015, Tell Brak was taken by the Kurdish forces.\n\nSee also\nChagar Bazar\nCities of the Ancient Near East\nHamoukar\nTall Al-Hamidiya\nTell Aqab\nTell Chuera\nTell Leilan\nTell Mozan\n\nReferences\nInformational notes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\nGeneral\n\nBiga, M.

          "summary": "Tell Brak (Nagar, Nawar) was an ancient city in Syria; it is one the earliest known cities in the world. Its remains constitute a tell located in the Upper Khabur region, near the modern village of Tell Brak, 50 kilometers north-east of Al-Hasaka city, Al-Hasakah Governorate. The city's original name is unknown. During the second half of the third millennium BC, the city was known as Nagar and later on, Nawar.\nStarting as a small settlement in the seventh millennium BC, Tell Brak's urbanization began in the late 5th millennium BCE and evolved during the fourth millennium BC into one of the biggest cities in Upper Mesopotamia, and interacted with the cultures of southern Mesopotamia. The city shrank in size at the beginning of the third millennium BC with the end of Uruk period, before expanding again around 2600 BC, when it became known as Nagar, and was the capital of a regional kingdom that controlled the Khabur river valley. Nagar was destroyed around 2300 BC, and came under the rule of the Akkadian Empire, followed by a period of independence as a Hurrian city-state, before contracting at the beginning of the second millennium BC. Nagar prospered again by the 19th century BC, and came under the rule of different regional powers. In c. 1500 BC, Tell Brak was a center of Mitanni before being destroyed by Assyria around 1300 BC. The city never regained its former importance, remaining as a small settlement, and abandoned at some points of its history, until disappearing from records during the early Abbasid era.\nDifferent peoples inhabited the city, including the Halafians, Semites and the Hurrians. Tell Brak was a religious center from its earliest periods; its famous Eye Temple is unique in the Fertile Crescent, and its main deity, Belet Nagar, was revered in the entire Khabur region, making the city a pilgrimage site. The culture of Tell Brak was defined by the different civilizations that inhabited it, and it was famous for its glyptic style, equids and glass. When independent, the city was ruled by a local assembly or by a monarch. Tell Brak was a trade center due to its location between Anatolia, the Levant and southern Mesopotamia. It was excavated by Max Mallowan in 1937, then regularly by different teams between 1979 and 2011, when the work stopped due to the Syrian Civil War.",

          "content": "Tell Halaf (Arabic: تل حلف) is an archaeological site in Al-Hasakah in northeastern Syria, a few kilometers from the city of Ras al-Ayn near the Syria–Turkey border. The site, which dates to the sixth millennium BCE, was the first to be excavated from a Neolithic culture, later called the Halaf culture, characterized by glazed pottery painted with geometric and animal designs.\nIt is thought to have been historically named Guzana, i.e. the Biblical Gozan.\n\nHistory\nNeolithic (Halaf culture)\nTell Halaf is the type site of the Halaf culture, which developed from Neolithic III at this site without any strong break. The Tell Halaf site flourished from around 6100 to 5400 BCE, a period of time that is referred to as the Halaf period.\n\nChalcolithic\nThe Halaf culture was succeeded in northern Mesopotamia by the Ubaid culture (c. 5300-4300 BC). The site was then abandoned for a long period.\n\nLate Bronze\nMitanni period\nThe Mitanni Empire controlled this region in the 15th century BC until around 1345 BC.\n\nHittite Period\nIn the Late Bronze, Suppiluliuma I of Hatti conquered the Mitanni stronghold of Carchemish, leading to the assassination of Tushratta of Mitanni around 1345 BC. With the fall of the Mitanni Empire, Carchemish became the seat of a hittite viceroy who ruled the region with the remnants of Mitanni as a bufferstate to the independent Assyrians in the east. Tell Halaf became a Hittite city led by the viceroy of Carchemish.\n\nIron Age (Neo-Hittite Guzana)\nRamesses III of Egypt states in an inscription dating to his 8th Year from his Medinet Habu mortuary temple that Carchemish was destroyed by the \"Sea Peoples\". This was a period of climate change and social unrest caused by drought, weakening the central powers, and marking the transition from the Late Bronze to the Iron Age. Furthermore, it saw the emergences of Neo-Hittite city-states.\n\nKingdom of Bit Bahiani (Guzana)\nIn the 10th century BCE, the rulers of the small Aramaean kingdom Bit Bahiani took their seat in Tell Halaf, re-founded as Guzana or Gozan. King Kapara built the so-called hilani, a palace in Neo-Hittite style with a rich decoration of statues and relief orthostats. These sculptures, even though it is not known how, were fundamental to the portrayal of Kapara along with their political power. By the end of the 9th century, it was a famous Syro-Hittite state.\n\nAssyrian Period\nIn 894 BCE, the Assyrian king Adad-nirari II recorded the site in his archives as a tributary Aramaean city-state.\nIn 808 BCE, the city and its surrounding area was reduced to a province of the Assyrian Empire. The governor's seat was a palace in the eastern part of the citadel mound.\nGuzana survived the collapse of the Assyrian Empire and remained inhabited until the Roman-Parthian Period.\nIn historical times, the mound itself became the citadel of the Aramaean and Assyrian city. The lower town extended 600 m N–S and 1000 m E–W. The citadel mound housed the palaces and other official buildings. Most prominent are the so-called Hilani or \"Western Palace\" with its rich decor, dating back to the time of King Kapara, and the \"North-Eastern Palace\", the seat of the Assyrian governors. In the lower town a temple (or cult room) in Assyrian style was discovered.\n\nExcavations\nThe site is located near the city of Ra's al-'Ayn in the fertile valley of the Khabur River (Nahr al-Khabur), close to the modern border with Turkey. The name Tell Halaf is a local Aramaic placename, tell meaning \"hill\", and Tell Halaf meaning \"made of former city\"; what its original inhabitants called their settlement is not known.\n\nDiscovery\nIn 1899, when the area was part of the Ottoman Empire, Max von Oppenheim, a German diplomat travelled from Cairo through northern Mesopotamia on behalf of Deutsche Bank, working on establishing a route for the Bagdad Railway. On 19 November, he discovered Tell Halaf, following up on tales told to him by local villagers of stone idols buried beneath the sand. Within three days, several significant pieces of statuary were uncovered, including a so-called \"Sitting Goddess\". A test pit uncovered the entrance to the \"Western Palace\". Since he had no legal permit to excavate, Oppenheim had the statues he found reburied and moved on.\n\nExcavations by Max von Oppenheim\nAccording to archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld, he had urged Oppenheim in 1907 to excavate Tell Halaf and they made some initial plans towards this goal at that time. In August 1910, Herzfeld wrote a letter calling on Oppenheim to explore the site and had it circulated to several leading archaeologists like Theodor Nöldeke or Ignác Goldziher to sign. Armed with this letter, Max von Oppenheim was now able to ask for his dismissal from the diplomatic service (which he did on 24 October 1910) while being able to call on financing from his father for the excavation.\nWith a team of five archaeologists, Oppenheim planned a digging campaign that began on 5 August 1911. Substantial amounts of equipment were imported from the German Empire, including a small steam train. The costs totaled around 750,000 Marks and were covered by von Oppenheim's father's banking fortune. On arrival, the archaeologists discovered that since 1899, locals had uncovered some of the findings and heavily damaged them – in part out of superstition, in part to gain valuable building material. Oppenheim had recruited five hundred locals from Tell Halaf to help towards the excavation.\nDuring the excavations, Oppenheim found the ruins of the town of Guzana (or Gozan). Significant finds included the large statues and reliefs of the so-called \"Western Palace\" built by King Kapara, as well as a cult room and tombs. Some of the statuary was found reused in buildings from the Hellenistic period. In addition, they discovered Neolithic pottery of a type which became known as Halaf culture after the site where it was first found. At the time, this was the oldest painted pottery ever found (together with those discovered at Samarra by Herzfeld).\nIn 1913, Oppenheim decided to return temporarily to the German Empire. The finds of Tell Halaf were left at the building he and his team had inhabited during the dig. Most of them were securely packaged and stored. The outbreak of World War I prevented Oppenheim from returning. However, Oppenheim was able to sell some of the stone reliefs, pottery and other artefacts he had excavated to various museums after the war including the British Museum and Walters Art Museum in Baltimore.\nIn 1926, Germany joined the League of Nations and it thus became possible for German nationals to conduct excavations in what was now the French-ruled Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. Preparing for new excavations, in 1927, Oppenheim again travelled to Tell Halaf. Artillery fire exchanged between Ottoman and French troops in the final days of the war had severely damaged the building and the archaeological findings had to be dug out of the rubble. Once again, it was found that the locals had damaged some of the stone workings. Since he had made plaster casts during the original excavation, Oppenheim was able to repair most of the damage done to the statues and orthostat reliefs. His finds were divided with the French authorities; his share (approximately 80, or about two-thirds of the total) was transported to Berlin, while the other 35 were brought to Aleppo to form the core collection of today's National Museum of Aleppo. In 1929, he resumed excavations and the new findings were divided.\n\nTell Halaf Museum, Berlin\nAttempts by Oppenheim to have his findings exhibited at the newly constructed Pergamon Museum in Berlin failed, as the museum refused to agree to Oppenheim's financial demands. He thus opened his own private \"Tell Halaf Museum\" in an industrial complex in Berlin-Charlottenburg in July 1930. The museum's concept of presenting the exhibits is considered quite modern even by today's standards.\nIn 1939, Oppenheim once more travelled to Syria for excavations, coming within sight of Tell Halaf. However, the French authorities refused to award him a permit to dig and he had to depart. Oppenheim also unsuccessfully tried to sell some of his finds in New York and again negotiated with the German government about the purchase of the Tell Halaf artefacts. In 1943, eight German-owned orthostat reliefs stored in New York were seized by the US Office of Alien Property Custodian. Amid these negotiations and activities, the Tell Halaf Museum in Berlin was hit by a British phosphorus bomb in November 1943. It burnt down completely, all wooden and limestone exhibits were destroyed. Those made from basalt were exposed to a thermal shock during attempts to fight the fire and severely damaged. Many statues and reliefs burst into dozens of pieces. Although the Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin took care of the remains, months passed before all of the pieces had been recovered and they were further damaged by frost and summer heat.\n\nReconstruction of the artefacts\nStored in the cellars of the Pergamon Museum during the period of communist rule under the GDR, the remains were left untouched. After reunification, the Masterplan Museumsinsel of 1999 brought up the idea of having the Western Palace front from Tell Halaf restored. With financial support from Sal. Oppenheim and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft the Vorderasiatisches Museum engaged in its largest-scale restoration project since the reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate. From 2001 to 2010, more than 30 sculptures were reconstructed out of around 27,000 fragments. They were exhibited at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin in 2011 and at the Bundeskunsthalle Bonn in 2014. When the reconstruction of the Museumsinsel is completed around 2025, the Western Palace façade will be the entrance to the new Vorderasiatisches Museum.\nThe many fragmented sculptures now evidence the story of their ancient heritage but also that of their journey through the 20th century: Oppenheim's destroyed Tell Halaf Museum was in East Berlin and could not be visited by anyone, including Oppenheim's family members, until the reunification of Germany in 1990. The 2019 exhibition Rayyane Tabet / Alien Property by Rayyane Tabet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art displays the museum's orthostat reliefs and Tabet's graphite transfers, Orthostates, in tandem with his family heirlooms, and addresses the role of an encyclopedic museum in conversation and collaboration with the past, and its voices.\n\nNew excavations\nIn 2006, new Syro-German excavations were started under the direction of Lutz Martin (Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin), Abd al-Masih Bagdo (Directorate of Antiquities Hassake), Jörg Becker (University of Halle) and Mirko Novák (University of Bern).\n\nSee also\nCities of the Ancient Near East\nBeehive tomb\nHadad-yith'i\n\nNotes\nReferences\nAbd el-Mesih Baghdo, Lutz Martin, Mirko Novák, Winfried Orthmann: Ausgrabungen auf dem Tell Halaf in Nordost-Syrien.

          "content": "Salkhad (Arabic: صَلْخَد, romanized: Ṣalḫad) is a Syrian city in the Suwayda Governorate, southern Syria.\nIt is the capital of Salkhad District, one of  the governorate's three districts. It had a population of 9,155 inhabitants in the 2004 census. In Salkhad, Druze make up the predominant population, while Christians and Sunni Muslim Bedouins represent a minority.\nIt is located at 1350 metres above sea level in the central Jabal el Druze highlands.\n\nHistory\nThe city is mentioned four times in the Hebrew Bible as \"Salcah\" (Hebrew: סַלְכָּה, romanized: Salḵāh), a settlement in biblical Bashan. Beginning in the second century BC Salcah was a flourishing Nabataean city, where the gods Dushara and Allat were worshiped. A dedication to the goddess Allat, dated to year 17 of the reign of Malichus II, son of Aretas IV (AD 57), survives from the first century AD.\nAfterwards it was incorporated into the Roman province of Arabia, it was one of the important cities in Hauran during Roman and later Byzantine epochs, Salkhad is indicated in the Madaba mosaic map of the sixth century AD.\nDue to the strategic position of the city overlooking Hauran plains to the west, the Ayyubid dynasty built a fortress in Salkhad between 1214–1247 to counter a possible attack of the Crusades into inner Hauran. It has also been said that Al-Afdal was exiled here by his uncle and brother.\nThe importance of the city decreased after the Crusades, and it was occasionally overrun by Bedouins seeking pasture in the summer for their flocks.\n\nOttoman era\nIn 1596, Salkhad appeared in the Ottoman tax registers  as Salhad (Sarhad) and was part of the nahiya of Bani Malik as-Sadir in the Hauran Sanjak. It had a Muslim population consisting of 55 households and 25 bachelors, and a Christian population of 50 households and 20 bachelors. The residents paid a fixed tax-rate of 40% on wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and beehives; a total of 36,500  akçe.\nIn 1838 Eli Smith noted that the place in ruins.\nA number of Greek Orthodox Christians, of Ghassanid ancestry, successively remained in the region. The town itself was abandoned in the late 18th century, but was repopulated by Druze and Greek Orthodox Christian families from Mount Lebanon beginning in 1858.\nDuring Ottoman times, the city enjoyed a feudal-type autonomy like much of the Jabal el Druze area under the chieftaincy of Al-Hamdan family and later Al-Atrash family, many battles against the Ottoman Empire took place in this region by the Druze locals to maintain their autonomy.\n\nModern era\nIn the early 20th century, the city was part of the 1921–1936 Druze state under the French Mandate of Syria, the state was gradually incorporated into Syria after the Syrian Revolution of 1925–1927 led by Sultan Al-Atrash.\nThe city now is the centre of Salkhad district of Suwayda Governorate, it is the southernmost district in Syria.\n\nReligious buildings\nSt. John the Baptist Greek Orthodox Church\nEvangelical Baptist Church\nMaqam Sultan Suleiman (Druze Shrine)\n\nClimate\nSalkhad has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: BSk). In winter there is more rainfall than in summer. The average annual temperature in Salkhad is 14.8 °C (58.6 °F). About 291 mm (11.46 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nArchaeology\nThe fortress of Salkhad is the most important monument located in a hill inside the city, built between 1214 and 1247 by the Ayyubid dynasty as a part of their defences against the crusades. It is said that this fortress were built in the site of older Roman fortifications. A hexagonal basalt minaret still standing intact in the city's main square. Many Roman old time houses, still partially inhabited by locals. Nabatean, Roman and Ayyubid tombs are also there with decorative motifs.\n\nSee also\nDruze in Syria\nChristians in Syria\nList of castles in Syria\nCapture of Salkhad\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\nOld image of the Fortress of Salkhad\nMap of the town, Google Maps",

          "content": "Safita (Arabic: صَافِيتَا Ṣāfītā; Phoenician: 𐤎‬𐤐𐤕‬𐤄, Sōpūte) is a city in the Tartus Governorate, western Syria, located to the southeast of Tartus and to the northwest of Krak des Chevaliers. It is situated on the tops of three hills and the valleys between them, in the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Safita had a population of 20,301 in the 2004 census. It has a religiously mixed population of mostly Greek Orthodox Christians and Alawites.\nThe Crusader-built fortress of Chastel Blanc in Safita enabled the city to historically dominate the surrounding region. Safita served as the center of a large rural district throughout Ottoman rule (1517–1918). Its influence receded with the administrative rise and economic development of the nearby port town of Tartus and the dimunition of its jurisdiction beginning under French Mandatory rule (1923–1946) and continuing post-Syrian independence. Safita shares close economic ties with Tartus, as well as having business networks extending across Syria's major cities and Lebanon. It remains an economic hub for the surrounding countryside.\n\nHistory\nSafita is located on a site where remains of the Phoenician settlement were discovered. The archaeological remains at the site of Tell Kazel were identified as the Phoenician city of Sumur mentioned in the Amarna letters.\n\nCrusader era\nRaymond IV, Count of Toulouse founded the County of Tripoli. The Knights Templar, to whom the lands of the region were given, built the fortress known today as the \"Chastel Blanc\". The fortress sits on a strategic observation point, and from there, it maintains eye contact with the network of fortresses of the Templar Order, Arwad and Tartus on the coast in the northwest, Chastel Rouge in the southwest and Krak des Chevaliers in the southeast. The Mamluk sultan Baybars captured Safita in 1271, bringing it under Muslim rule.\n\nOttoman era\nSafita was the center of the principal nahiya (subdistrict) of the southern Syrian Coastal Mountain Range during Ottoman rule through the 16th and early 17th centuries, spanning about fifty villages and, at times, including the subdistricts of Mi'ar, Qulay'a and Tartus within its jurisdiction. The inhabitants of the nahiya were Christians and Alawites. The Sayfa dynasty, based in the hinterland of Tripoli, controlled the town until 1640, often using its fortress in their wars with the Druze Ma'n dynasty of Mount Lebanon. In 1621, the governor of Tripoli Eyalet, Yusuf Sayfa, dispatched a force against his nephew, and ally of the Ma'nid Fakhr ad-Din II, Sulayman Sayfa, in Safita for not forwarding the subdistrict's tax revenue.\nAfter 1640, Safita is seldom mentioned in the historical chronicles of the middle Ottoman period. However, court records in Tripoli Sanjak, of which Safita was part, the earliest of which date to 1666 and 1667, indicate the iltizam (tax farms) of the Safita nahiya were sold to the Alawite brothers Muhammad ibn Shamsin and Zaydan ibn Shamsin, in 1667–1668. They were charged with collecting taxes on behalf of the government on fruit trees, agricultural lands, falcons, bees, silk, flour mills, buffalo, wave labor, festivals, weddings, and wintering camps of Turkmen and Arab nomads, as well as collecting the jizya (poll tax) from the Christian communities. The Shamsin (or Shibli) family emerged as the dominant local force of Safita at least from the late 17th century until the mid-19th century.\n\nFrench Mandatory rule\nUnder Ottoman rule into the early 20th century, Safita served as the principal city of Syria's southern coastal mountain range by dint of its large population and its economic influence and administrative authority over a large district. Its decline began under French Mandatory rule (1923–1946), when the nearby coastal town of Tartus became a sanjak capital, diluting Safita's influence. In 1933, Safita had a population of 2,715 Christians and 280 Alawites. In 1943, Safita's population of 3,500 continued to largely consist of Greek Orthodox Christians. At the time, its houses were described as well-built and made of alternating black and white stones and clustered around the Crusader-era fortress.\n\nPost-Syrian independence\nSyria gained its independence in 1946. In 1960, Safita's population consisted of 4,300 Christians and 1,900 Alawites. With Tartus's elevation as the capital of a new governorate, the Tartus Governorate, in 1967, Safita's administrative subordination to Tartus was reinforced. The increased civic importance of Tartus and the construction of a major port there along with the development of irrigated commercial agriculture along the coastal plain drew more economic and civil activity away from Safita. Many Safitan entrepreneurs opened businesses in the developing port city, while maintaining their primary residences in Safita. In 1967–1970, Safita's administrative clout was further reduced when half of the Safita District was made a new district centered in the mountain town of Dreikish and the subdistrict of Safsafa was transferred to Tartus District.\nAs of the late 1990s, most Safitans worked in Tartus and the anthropologist Fabrice Balanche described Safita as a satellite or suburb of Tartus. At the same time, people from Safita have settled in all of Syria's major cities and in Lebanon, providing the city with a large economic network which mitigates its economic reliance on Tartus. Safita remains a commercial hub for a relatively large hinterland. Many residents from the surrounding villages open shops in the city, which also serves as a professional hub with a relatively large number of medical and legal practices and engineering businesses.\n\nChristians in the city have a lower birthrate and a higher emigration rate, while there has been a continuous migration of Alawites from the countryside to the city. Balanche surmises, based on his own observations, that Safita's old town remains mostly populated by Christians, while the city in general has a slight Alawite majority. The two communities share similar lifestyles and their relations have not been characterized by sectarian tension. The city has benefited from Christians' established economic networks and many local Alawites' connections to Syria's military and political power centers. The most influential political movements in the city since the 1950s have been the ruling Ba'ath Party and the Communist Party. The state constructed a five-star luxury hotel in Safita from the Cham hotel chain and built a modern road network, widening the Safita–Tartus and Safita–Homs highways to three lanes, in the 1990s. The villages in the Safita District are also well connected to the city and in 1994, six adjacent communities were incorpated into the Safita municipality. This has allowed the city a significantly higher fiscal allocation from the state and these subsidies have funded major municipal projects, including preservation efforts of the old town, construction of a ring road, and new or improved sewer networks and wastewater treatment.\n\nGeography\nSafita is situated at the southeastern end of the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range. It is 26 kilometers (16 mi) southeast of the Mediterranean port city of Tartus and 55 kilometers (34 mi) northwest of Homs. The average elevation of Safita is 400 meters (1,300 ft) above sea level, while the Crusader fortress stands about 720 meters (2,360 ft). The hill upon on which Safita's citadel stands had historically enabled it to dominate the surrounding region. The citadel overlooks the fortress of Margat (Marqab) to the north, the Krak des Chevaliers (al-Husn or Hisn al-Akrad) to the east and Tripoli to the south, positioning it as a relay node between the three fortresses during the medieval period.\nThe city sits on a crossroads that intersects the east-west highway between Tartus and Homs and the north-south highway between Safita and Dreikish. Its north-south connectivity is enabled by its geography: compared with other towns in the coastal mountains, Safita's decline is not steep (not exceeding 400 meters (1,300 ft)) and the valleys to its north and south are not cut by streams. The Safita-Dreikish road is the only north-south connection in the mountains that is frequently served by public transport.\nDue to its slope landform, the surrounding rural areas to Safita are used by landowners for olive cultivation and olive oil production.\n\nClimate\nSafita has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa) with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is part of the wettest region of Syria due to the orographic effect of the coastal Mediterranean Sea mountains, receiving around 1,200 millimetres or 47 inches of rainfall per year, or about ten times as much as Damascus and four times as much as Aleppo.\n\nLandmarks\nThe Crusader fortress \"Chastel Blanc\", a square tower built in 1202, is well preserved and rises to a height of 28 meters. It is 18 meters wide and 31 meters long. Among its walls, 3 meters high, is a chapel dedicated to St. Michael and serving the Greek Orthodox community of the city. The second floor of the building, which can be ascended in a stone staircase, was originally used as a dormitory and is illuminated by firing slits. Beneath the tower was a water cistern that was used by the inhabitants of the fortress.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nAbu-Husayn, Abdul-Rahim (1985). Provincial Leaderships in Syria, 1575-1650.

          "title": "Masyaf",
          "content": "Masyaf (Arabic: مصياف Miṣyāf) is a city in northwestern Syria. It is the center of the Masyaf District in the Hama Governorate. As of 2004, Masyaf had a religiously diverse population of approximately 22,000 Ismailis, Alawites and Christians. The city is well known for its large medieval castle, particularly its role as the headquarters of the Nizari Ismailis and their elite Assassins unit.\n\nEtymology\nThroughout the Islamic era and until the modern day, the Arabic name of the city was pronounced in a number of different ways by the inhabitants of the region as Maṣyaf, Maṣyat or Maṣyad. The Arabic name is a local pronunciation that evolved from the Assyrian name Manṣuate. The \"nṣw\" in Manṣuate correlates with the Arabic \"nṣṣ\", which means \"to set up\", according to orientalist scholar Edward Lipinsky. Moreover, Lipinsky suggests that the Assyrian name was likely a configuration of the Assyrian word manṣuwatu which correlates with the Arabic word minaṣṣatu(n), both of which translate as \"raised platform\". This translation is indicative of the promontory that the Masyaf fortress occupies which overlooks the rest of the city and the surrounding area.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nMasyaf is the most probable site of the ancient Aramean city of Mansuate that existed in the 8th century BC. It later served as the administrative center of an Assyrian province by the same name in modern-day central Syria. Masyaf is also likely the site of Marsyas. Roman and Byzantine historians mentioned a city named \"Marsyas\" that governed the al-Ghab and Beqaa plains to the north and south of the site, respectively.\nMasyaf and its fortress were first mentioned by Crusader chroniclers in 1099. However, because a fortification at Masyaf likely existed prior to the 11th century, it is probable that the Aleppo-based Hamdanid dynasty built a fort at Masyaf, due to its position as an outpost overlooking the mountain roads. At that time, the fortress was a part of Jund Qinnasrin (Chalcis Province) of the Fatimid Caliphate. In the autumn of 999, Basil II, the Byzantine emperor, destroyed the fortifications at Masyaf as part of his campaign to gain control of Antioch and its environs from the Muslims.\nThe area would later come under Seljuk rule, but in 1099, the Crusaders attempted to wrest control of Masyaf (and the more strategically important Rafania) following their capture of Tripoli. The Seljuk atabeg of Damascus, Toghtekin, launched a military campaign to prevent the loss of the area and reached a short-lived accommodation with the Crusaders whereby Masyaf and Hisn al-Akrad would remain in Muslim hands, but have to pay tribute to the Crusaders. Sometime later, Masyaf was controlled by the Mirdasid dynasty. In 1127, the Mirdasids sold it to the Shaizar-based Banu Munqidh family.\n\nNizari Ismaili era\nIn 1140, Masyaf was captured by the Nizari Ismailis, a sect of Ismaili branch of Shia. The fortress was being defended by a Banu Munqidh mamluk (slave warrior) named Sunqur, who the Ismaili force managed to ambush and kill. The Ismailis had chosen Syria as their new home and successively settled in the cities of Aleppo and Damascus and the fortress of Banias, each time being persecuted and massacred by the authorities or mobs of local residents incited by clerics who accused the Ismailis of being heretics or causing problems. Consequently, the surviving Ismaili leadership decided that establishing bases in Syria's cities and thus relying on the goodwill of various umara (princes) was untenable. Instead, they chose to settle in Jabal Ansariyah, a coastal mountain range dotted with fortresses, including Masyaf.\n\nFollowing its capture, Masyaf served as the principal fortress for the Ismailis' chief da'i. Together with other fortresses acquired at around the same time, including al-Kahf, Khawabi, al-Qadmus and al-Rusafa, the Ismailis were able to carve an autonomous territory for themselves amid hostile Crusader states and local Muslim dynasties nominally affiliated with the Abbasid Caliphate. Masyaf served as the headquarters of the Ismaili da'i Rashid ad-Din Sinan and his elite unit of fida'i who were known as the Assassins.\nIn the mid-1170s, the Ayyubid sultan Saladin set about conquering Syria, ousting the Crusaders and uniting the Muslim world under Sunni Islam. The Ismailis considered Saladin a more dangerous threat than the Crusaders and allied with Saladin's rival in Aleppo to defeat the Ayyubids. Sinan's men launched two unsuccessful attempts to assassinate Saladin and in 1176, Saladin launched a punitive expedition against the Assassins in the strongly-defended fortress of Masyaf. Within a few days of the siege, Saladin withdrew due to an urgent need to redeploy against the Crusaders who were attacking Ayyubid territory in the Beqaa. He arranged a truce with Sinan mediated by the Ayyubid emir of Hama, Shihab al-Din Mahmud al-Harimi, Saladin's uncle.\n\nMamluk rule\nA wall around the town of Masyaf was built in 1249 by the Persian leader of the Ismailis, Taj al-Din Abu'l Futuh. In 1260, the Mongols under Hulagu conquered most of northern Syria and briefly occupied Masyaf. However, following the Mongols' rout at the Battle of Ain Jalut at the hand of the Bahri Mamluks later that year, they withdrew from Masyaf and it once again fell under Ismaili control.\nIn 1262, Masyaf's rulers were ordered to pay tribute to the Mamluk sultan Baibars and some time after, the sultan had Masyaf's emir Najm al-Din Ismail replaced by Sarim al-Din Mubarak. Mubarak was later imprisoned in Cairo by Baibars and Najm ad-Din was briefly restored as emir before Masyaf was fully incorporated into the sultanate in 1270. Ismailis continued inhabiting it throughout Mamluk rule. Towards the end of the century, Masyaf became a major stopping point on the Mamluk postal route and was controlled by a commander who answered directly to the sultan due to its strategic role as a frontier fortress.\nIn 1320, the historian and Ayyubid emir of Hama, Abu'l Fida, noted that Masyaf was a \"center of the Ismailian Doctrine\" and that it was \"beautiful\" with gardens and a spring from which flowed a small stream. According to Ibn Battuta, who passed by the town in 1355, Masyaf was the center of a district belonging to the province of Tripoli and containing the fortress villages of al-Rusafa, al-Kahf, al-Qadmus, al-Ulayqa and al-Maniqa. Masyaf was later separated from Tripoli and transferred to the authority of Damascus province. In the mid-15th century, under Sultan Barsbay, a road was built that connected Masyaf with Tripoli, but the postal route no longer passed through the town. In 1446, the historian Khalil al-Zahiri described Masyaf as \"a pleasant town, with an extensive countryside\".\n\nOttoman era\nMasyaf, along with the rest of Syria, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1516–17 following the Ottoman victory over the Mamluks at the Battle of Marj Dabiq. Masyaf became a part of the liwa (district) of Homs, and along with the other Ismaili fortresses in its vicinity (qala' al-da'wa), was responsible for paying a special tax. The town had a khan (caravanserai) which paid tolls to the Ottoman authorities. The tolls were abolished later in the mid-16th century. According to the Sufi traveler Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi, the emir of Masyaf in the early 1690s was a descendant of the Arab Tanukh tribe named Sulayman.\nIn 1703, the Raslan clan, an Alawite tribe, took over Masyaf and controlled it for about eight years until it was restored to the Ismailis following the intervention of the Ottoman authorities. During this period, the majority of Masyaf's Ismaili inhabitants followed the Nizari sect although there was a small Tayyibi minority too. In 1788, the emir of Masyaf, Mustafa ibn Idris, built a sabil (ablutions fountain) and a house that would be used by himself and successive Ismaili emirs.\nIn 1808, the Raslan clan led by Sheikh Mahmud Raslan attacked Masyaf, killing its Ismaili chief, Mustafa Milhim, and his son, and captured the fortress. About 300 of the town's Ismaili inhabitants were also killed, while many others, including the da'i (religious chief) of Masyaf, fled for Homs, Hama and other areas in central Syria, settling in those places temporarily. The Ismailis had already been in the process of being gradually expelled from Jabal Ansariyah by Alawite clans. The Ottoman governor of Damascus, Kunj Yusuf Pasha, intervened in the matter, dispatching a force of 4,000–5,000 soldiers to recapture the town. After three months of fighting, the Raslans surrendered Masyaf. Ismaili control over the town and its fortress was restored in 1810.\nTwo years after the resettlement of Masyaf by the Ismailis, Johann Ludwig Burckhardt recorded an estimated population of 280 families, most of which were Ismaili and 30 were Christian. Burchardt noted that the town's citadel, many houses, the mosque and most other buildings were either heavily damaged or destroyed from previous fighting. Throughout the remainder of the 19th century, Masyaf's population continued to decrease.\n\nModern era\nThe Allied Powers captured Syria from the Ottomans in 1917, after which the residents largely abandoned the fortress of Masyaf. British general T. E. Lawrence rested in Masyaf and remarked that the fortress was being used as a poorhouse at the time. During the French Mandate over Syria, the French separated the Jabal Ansariyah range from the rest of Syria to form the Alawite State. Masyaf was made a part of the State of Damascus, but in 1929, a number of rural Alawite villages in its immediate vicinity, including al-Rusafa, al-Bayyadiyah, Akakir, Maryamin and Abu Qubays, were ceded to the Alawite State. The latter merged with the rest of Syria in 1936. In 1939, Masyaf and its district was transferred from the Province of Hama to the Province of Latakia. Throughout the 1930s, rooms in the fortress were still being used by local residents.\nIn 1947, a year after Syria became independent from France, 3,808 Ismailis were recorded to be living in Masyaf. The Syrian government under President Amin al-Hafiz established Masyaf as a center for carpet weaving in 1965. The weaving workshops mostly employed women. In the 1960s, Masyaf's Ismaili community largely identified with the Nasserist movement, in contrast to the Alawites who dominated the surrounding villages who were mostly associated with the Baathists.\nIn 1970, much of the town of Masyaf still remained within the confines of the city walls. However, by 1998, its population and urban space had expanded considerably outside the walls. The fortress is situated in the northeastern part of Masyaf's old city. The walls remained in place, but the homes and gardens of local residents were built immediately alongside them. Within the walls is a mosque dating to the 12th century and according to local residents, is associated with Saladin. The fortress is considered a national monument and is directly under the authority of the Syrian Directorate of Antiquities.\nIn the Syrian Civil War after 2015, an alleged missile production facility in Masyaf and a base near the town, thought to be used by Iranian forces and militias, became repeatedly targets of airstrikes attributed to Israel.\nOn 8 September 2024, Israel launched a series of airstrikes as well as a ground raid by the Shaldag unit, targeting an underground precision missile factory reportedly built by Iran.\n\nGeography\nMasyaf is situated along the foothills of the eastern slopes of the Jabal Ansariyah coastal mountain range. The average elevation of Masyaf is 485 meters. It is just west of the al-Ghab Plain. The area is marked by gardens, orchards and fields of wheat and barley which are cultivated by local residents. To the north and south of Masyaf flow seasonal streams which feed into a tributary of the Orontes River, called al-Sarout.\nThe city of Hama is 45 kilometers to the east and Baniyas is 54 kilometers to the west. Hama is connected to the town via a road north of Masyaf which passes through al-Laqbah and Deir Shamil. Nearby villages include al-Rusafa to the southeast, al-Bayda to the south, al-Suwaydah to the southwest, Rabu to the west, Biqraqa to the northwest, Hurayf and Hayalin to the north, Zaynah to the northeast and al-Shiha to the east.\n\nClimate\nMasyaf has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa). In winter there is much more rainfall in Masyaf than in summer. The average annual temperature in Masyaf is 17.6 °C (63.7 °F). About 1,049 mm (41.30 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Masyaf had a population of 22,508 in the 2004 census. It is the administrative center of the Masyaf District and the Masyaf Subdistrict. The latter had a population of 68,184 in 2004. In the mid-1940s, its inhabitants were predominantly Ismailis. Today, it is a religiously mixed city of Ismailis and Alawites, with a Christian minority.\n\nIn popular culture\nMasyaf is featured as the base of operations of the Assassin Order during the Third Crusade in the Assassin's Creed games series (mainly in Assassin's Creed and Assassin's Creed: Revelations). The village appears built on a rock, with the Masyaf fortress at the top.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n Media related to Masyaf at Wikimedia Commons",
