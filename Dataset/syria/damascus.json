      "content": "Damascus is the capital and largest city of Syria. It is the oldest capital city in the world. Known colloquially in Syria as aš-Šām and dubbed, poetically, the \"City of Jasmine\" (مَدِيْنَةُ الْيَاسْمِينِ Madīnat al-Yāsmīn), Damascus is a major cultural center of the Levant and the Arab world.\nSituated in southwestern Syria, Damascus is the center of a large metropolitan area. Nestled among the eastern foothills of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean on a plateau 680 metres (2,230 ft) above sea level, Damascus experiences an arid climate because of the rain shadow effect. The Barada River flows through Damascus.\nDamascus is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. First settled in the 3rd millennium BC, it was chosen as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate from 661 to 750. After the victory of the Abbasid dynasty, the seat of Islamic power was moved to Baghdad. According to some, Damascus is the fourth holiest city in Islam. The city saw its importance decline throughout the Abbasid era, only to regain significant importance in the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods.\nToday, it is the seat of the central government of Syria. Damascus was named the least livable city out of 140 global cities in the Global Liveability Ranking. As of June 2023, it was the least livable out of 173 global cities in the same Global Liveability Ranking. In 2017, two new development projects were launched in Damascus to build new residential districts, Marota City and Basillia City to symbolize post-war reconstruction.\n\nNames and etymology\nThe name of Damascus first appeared in the geographical list of Thutmose III as ṯmśq (𓍘𓄟𓊃𓈎𓅱) in the 15th century BC.\nThe etymology of the ancient name ṯmśq is uncertain. It is attested as Imerišú (𒀲𒋙) in Akkadian, Damašq (𐡃𐡌𐡔𐡒‎) in Old Aramaic and Dammeśeq (דַּמֶּשֶׂק) in Biblical Hebrew. A number of Akkadian spellings are found in the Amarna letters, from the 14th century BC: Dimašqa (𒁲𒈦𒋡), Dimašqì (𒁲𒈦𒀸𒄀), and Dimašqa (𒁲𒈦𒀸𒋡).\nLater Aramaic spellings of the name often include an intrusive resh (letter r), perhaps influenced by the root dr, meaning \"dwelling\". Thus, the English and Latin name of the city is Damascus, which was imported from Greek Δαμασκός and originated from the Qumranic Darmeśeq (דרמשק), and Darmsûq (ܕܪܡܣܘܩ) in Syriac, meaning \"a well-watered land\".\nAccording to ancient Greek tradition, there were three myths about the origin of the city's name (Δαμασκός). One claims it was named after the giant Ascus (Ἄσκος). Another says it was named after Damaskos, the son of Hermes and the nymph Alimede, who traveled from Arcadia to Syria and founded a city bearing his name. A third version holds that Damaskos was a man who, after Dionysus made Syria fertile with vineyards, cut them down with an axe. Enraged, Dionysus pursued and flayed him. His original name was Darmaskos, which later evolved into Damaskos.\nIn Arabic, the city is called Dimashq (دمشق Dimašq). The city is also known as aš-Šām by the citizens of Damascus, of Syria and other Arab neighbors and Turkey (Şam). Aš-Šām is an Arabic term for \"Levant\" and for \"Syria\"; the latter, and particularly the historical region of Syria, is called Bilād aš-Šām (بلاد الشام, lit. 'land of the Levant'). The latter term etymologically means \"land of the left-hand side\" or \"the north\", as someone in the Hijaz facing east, oriented to the sunrise, will find the north to the left. This is contrasted with the name of Yemen (اَلْيَمَن al-Yaman), correspondingly meaning \"the right-hand side\" or \"the south\". The variation ش ء م (š-ʾ-m'), of the more typical ش م ل (š-m-l), is also attested in Old South Arabian, 𐩦𐩱𐩣 (šʾm), with the same semantic development.\n\nGeography\nDamascus was built in a strategic site on a plateau 680 m (2,230 ft) above sea level and about 80 km (50 mi) inland from the Mediterranean, sheltered by the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, supplied with water by the Barada River, and at a crossroads between trade routes: the north–south route connecting Egypt with Asia Minor, and the east–west cross-desert route connecting Lebanon with the Euphrates river valley. The Anti-Lebanon Mountains mark the border between Syria and Lebanon. The range has peaks of over 10,000 ft (3,000 m) and blocks precipitation from the Mediterranean Sea, so the region of Damascus is sometimes subject to droughts. However, in ancient times, the Barada River mitigated this, which originates from mountain streams fed by melting snow. Damascus is surrounded by the Ghouta, irrigated farmland where many vegetables, cereals, and fruits have been farmed since ancient times. Maps of Roman Syria indicate that the Barada River emptied into a lake of some size east of Damascus. Today it is called Bahira Atayba, the hesitant lake because in years of severe drought, it does not even exist.\nThe modern city has an area of 105 km2 (41 sq mi), out of which 77 km2 (30 sq mi) is urban, while Jabal Qasioun occupies the rest.\n\nThe old city of Damascus, enclosed by the city walls, lies on the south bank of the river Barada which is almost dry (3 cm (1 in) left). To the southeast, north, and northeast it is surrounded by suburban areas whose history stretches back to the Middle Ages: Midan in the southwest, Sarouja and Imara in the north and north-west. These neighborhoods originally arose on roads leading out of the city, near the tombs of religious figures. In the 19th century outlying villages developed on the slopes of Jabal Qasioun, overlooking the city, already the site of the al-Salihiyah neighborhood centered on the important shrine of medieval Andalusian Sheikh and philosopher Ibn Arabi. These new neighborhoods were initially settled by Kurdish soldiery and Muslim refugees from the Europe regions of the Ottoman Empire which had fallen under Christian rule. Thus they were known as al-Akrad (the Kurds) and al-Muhajirin (the migrants). They lay 2–3 km (1–2 mi) north of the old city.\nFrom the late 19th century on, a modern administrative and commercial center began to spring up to the west of the old city, around the Barada, centered on the area known as al-Marjeh or \"the meadow\". Al-Marjeh soon became the name of what was initially the central square of modern Damascus, with the city hall in it. The courts of justice, post office, and railway station stood on higher ground slightly to the south. A Europeanized residential quarter soon began to be built on the road leading between al-Marjeh and al-Salihiyah. The commercial and administrative center of the new city gradually shifted northwards slightly towards this area.\n\nIn the 20th century, newer suburbs developed north of the Barada, and to some extent to the south, invading the Ghouta oasis. In 1956–1957, the new neighborhood of Yarmouk became a second home to many Palestinian refugees. City planners preferred to preserve the Ghouta as far as possible, and in the later 20th century some of the main areas of development were to the north, in the western Mezzeh neighborhood and most recently along the Barada valley in Dummar in the northwest and on the slopes of the mountains at Barzeh in the north-east. Poorer areas, often built without official approval, have mostly developed south of the main city.\nDamascus used to be surrounded by an oasis, the Ghouta region (Arabic: الغوطة, romanized: al-ġūṭä), watered by the Barada river. The Fijeh spring, west along the Barada valley, used to provide the city with drinking water, and various sources to the west are tapped by water contractors. The flow of the Barada dropped with the rapid expansion of housing and industry in the city and it is almost dry. The lower aquifers are polluted by the city's runoff from heavily used roads, industry, and sewage.\n\nClimate\nDamascus has a cool arid climate (BWk) in the Köppen-Geiger system, due to the rain shadow effect of the Anti-Lebanon Mountains and the prevailing ocean currents. Summers are prolonged, dry, and hot with less humidity. Winters are cool and somewhat rainy; snowfall is infrequent. Autumn is brief and mild, but has the most drastic temperature change, unlike spring where the transition to summer is more gradual and steady. Annual rainfall is around 130 mm (5 in), occurring from October to May.\n\nHistory\nEarly settlement\nCarbon-14 dating at Tell Ramad, on Damascus's outskirts, suggests that the site may have been occupied since the second half of the seventh millennium BC, possibly around 6300 BC. But evidence of settlement in the wider Barada basin dating to 9000 BC exists, although no large-scale settlement was present within Damascus's walls until the second millennium BC.\n\nLate Bronze\nSome of the earliest Egyptian records are the Amarna letters, from 1350 BC, when Damascus (called Dimasqu) was ruled by king Biryawaza. Circa 1260 BC, the Damascus region and the rest of Syria became a battleground between the Hittites from the north and the Egyptians from the south, ending with a signed treaty between Hattusili III and Ramesses II. The former handed over control of the Damascus area to the latter in 1259 BC. The arrival of the Sea Peoples around 1200 BC marked the end of the Bronze Age in the region and brought about new development of warfare. Damascus was only a peripheral part of this picture, which mostly affected the larger population centers of ancient Syria. But these events contributed to Damascus's emergence as an influential center during the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age.\nDamascus is mentioned in Genesis 14:15 as existing at the time of the War of the Kings. According to the 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus's Antiquities of the Jews, Damascus (along with Trachonitis) was founded by Uz, the son of Aram. In Antiquities i. 7, Josephus reports:\n\nNicolaus of Damascus, in the fourth book of his History, says thus: \"Abraham reigned at Damascus, being a foreigner, who came with an army out of the land above Babylon, called the land of the Chaldeans: but, after a long time, he got him up, and removed from that country also, with his people, and went into the land then called the land of Canaan, but now the land of Judea, and this when his posterity became a multitude; as to which posterity of his, we relate their history in another work. Now the name of Abraham is even still famous in the country of Damascus; and there is a village named after him, The Habitation of Abraham.\n\nAram-Damascus\nDamascus is first documented as an important city during the arrival of the Aramaeans, a Semitic people, in the 11th century BC. By the start of the first millennium BC, several Aramaic kingdoms formed, as Aramaeans abandoned their nomadic lifestyle and formed federated tribal states. One of these was Aram-Damascus, centered on its capital, Damascus. The Aramaeans who entered the city without battle adopted the name \"Dimashqu\" for their new home. Noticing the agricultural potential of the still undeveloped and sparsely populated area, they established a water distribution system by constructing canals and tunnels that maximized the efficiency of the river Barada. The Romans and the Umayyads later improved the network, which still forms the basis of the water system of the old part of the city. The Aramaeans initially turned Damascus into an outpost of a loose federation of Aramaean tribes, known as Aram-Zobah, based in the Beqaa Valley.\nThe city gained preeminence in southern Syria when Ezron, the claimant to Aram-Zobah's throne who was denied kingship of the federation, fled Beqaa and captured Damascus by force in 965 BC. He overthrew the city's tribal governor and founded the independent entity of Aram-Damascus. As this state expanded south, it prevented the Kingdom of Israel from spreading north and the two kingdoms soon clashed as they both sought to dominate trading hegemony in the east. Under Ezron's grandson, Ben-Hadad I (880–841 BC), and his successor Hazael, Damascus annexed Bashan (modern-day Hauran region), and went on the offensive with Israel. This conflict continued until the early 8th century BC, when Ben-Hadad II was captured by Israel after unsuccessfully besieging Samaria. As a result, he granted Israel trading rights in Damascus.\nAnother possible reason for the treaty between Aram-Damascus and Israel was the common threat of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which was trying to expand into the Mediterranean coast. In 853 BC, King Hadadezer of Damascus led a Levantine coalition that included forces from the northern Aram-Hamath kingdom and troops supplied by King Ahab of Israel in the Battle of Qarqar against the Neo-Assyrian army. Aram-Damascus was victorious, temporarily preventing the Assyrians from encroaching into Syria. But after Hadadzezer was killed by his successor, Hazael, the Levantine alliance collapsed. Aram-Damascus tried to invade Israel but was interrupted by the renewed Assyrian invasion. Hazael ordered a retreat to the walled part of Damascus while the Assyrians plundered the remainder of the kingdom. Unable to enter the city, they declared their supremacy in the Hauran and Beqa'a valleys.\nBy the 8th century BC, Damascus was practically engulfed by the Assyrians and entered a Dark Age. Nonetheless, it remained the economic and cultural center of the Near East as well as the Arameaen resistance. In 727, a revolt took place in the city but was put down by Assyrian forces. After Assyria led by Tiglath-Pileser III went on a wide-scale campaign of quelling revolts throughout Syria, Damascus became subjugated by their rule. One effect of this was stability for the city and benefits from the spice and incense trade with Arabia. In 694 BC, the town was called Šaʾimerišu (Akkadian: 𒐼𒄿𒈨𒊑𒋙𒌋) and its governor was named Ilu-issīya. Assyrian authority dwindled by 609–605 BC, and Syria-Palestine fell into the orbit of Pharaoh Necho II's Egypt. By 572 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonians had conquered all of Syria, but Damascus's status under Babylon is relatively unknown.\n\nHellenistic period\nDamascus was conquered by Alexander the Great. After his death in 323 BC, it became the site of a struggle between the Seleucid and Ptolemaic empires. Control of the city passed frequently from one empire to the other. Seleucus I Nicator, one of Alexander's generals, made Antioch the capital of his empire, which led to the decline of Damascus's importance compared with new Seleucid cities such as Syrian Laodicea in the north. Later, Demetrius III Philopator rebuilt the city according to the Greek hippodamian system and renamed it \"Demetrias\".\n\nRoman period\nIn 64 BC, the Roman general Pompey annexed the western part of Syria. The Romans occupied Damascus and incorporated it into the league of ten cities known as the Decapolis which itself was incorporated into the province of Syria and granted autonomy.\nDamascus was entirely redesigned by the Romans after Pompey conquered the region. The Old Town of Damascus retains the rectangular shape of the Roman city, with its two main axes: the Decumanus Maximus (east-west; known today as the Via Recta) and the Cardo (north-south), the Decumanus being about twice as long. The Romans built a monumental gate at the eastern end of Decumanus Maximus. The gate originally had three arches, with the central arch for chariots and others for pedestrians.\n\nIn 23 BC, Caesar Augustus gave Herod the Great lands controlled by Zenodorus, and some scholars believe Herod was also granted control of Damascus. Either control of Damascus reverted to Syria upon Herod the Great's death or it was part of the lands given to Herod Philip that were given to Syria with his death in 33/34 AD.\nIt is speculated that control of Damascus was gained by Aretas IV Philopatris of Nabatea between the death of Herod Philip in 33/34 AD and the death of Aretas in 40 AD, but there is substantial evidence that Aretas did not control the city before 37 AD and there are many reasons it could not have been a gift from Caligula between 37 and 40 AD. In fact, all these theories stem not from any actual evidence outside the New Testament but rather \"a certain understanding of 2 Corinthians 11:32\" and in reality \"neither from archaeological evidence, secular-historical sources, nor New Testament texts can Nabatean sovereignty over Damascus in the first century AD be proven.\" Roman emperor Trajan, who annexed the Nabataean Kingdom, creating the province of Arabia Petraea, had previously been in Damascus, as his father Marcus Ulpius Traianus was governor of Syria from 73 to 74 AD, where he met the ethnically Greek architect and engineer Apollodorus of Damascus, who joined him in Rome when he was a consul in 91 AD and built several monuments during the 2nd century.\nDamascus became a metropolis by the beginning of the 2nd century and in 222 it was upgraded to a colonia by Emperor Septimius Severus. During the Pax Romana, Damascus and the entire Roman province of Syria began to prosper. Damascus's importance as a caravan city was evident, with the trade routes from southern Arabia, Palmyra, Petra, and the Silk Road all converging on it. The city satisfied the Roman demands for eastern luxuries. Circa 125 AD the Roman emperor Hadrian promoted the city of Damascus to \"Metropolis of Coele-Syria\".\nLittle remains of the architecture of the Romans, but the town planning of the old city had a lasting effect. Roman architects brought together the city's Greek and Aramaean foundations and fused them into a new layout measuring about 1,500 by 750 m (4,920 by 2,460 ft), surrounded by a wall. The wall had seven gates, but only the eastern gate, Bab Sharqi, remains. Roman Damascus lies mostly at depths of up to five meters (16 feet) below the modern city.\n\nThe old borough of Bab Tuma was developed at the end of the Roman/Byzantine era by the local Eastern Orthodox community. According to the Acts of the Apostles, Saint Paul and Saint Thomas both lived in that neighborhood. Roman Catholic historians also consider Bab Tuma the birthplace of several Popes, such as John V and Gregory III. Accordingly, a community of Jewish Christians converted to Christianity with the advent of Saint Paul's proselytization.\nDuring the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the city was besieged and captured by Shahrbaraz in 613 along with a large number of Byzantine troops as prisoners. It was in Sasanian hands until near the end of the war.\n\nRashidun period\nThe Prophet Muhammad's first indirect interaction with the people of Damascus was when he sent a letter, through his companion Shiya ibn Wahab, to Harith ibn Abi Shamir, the king of Damascus. The letter stated: \"Peace be upon him who follows true guidance. Be informed that my religion shall prevail everywhere. You should accept Islam, and whatever under your command shall remain yours.\"\n\nAfter most of the Syrian countryside was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate during the reign of Caliph Umar (r. 634–644), Damascus itself was conquered by the Arab Muslim general Khalid ibn al-Walid in August–September 634 CE. His army had previously attempted to capture the city in April 634 but without success. With Damascus now in Muslim-Arab hands, the Byzantines, alarmed at the loss of their most prestigious city in the Near East, had decided to wrest back control of it. Under Emperor Heraclius, the Byzantines fielded an army superior to that of the Rashidun in manpower. They advanced into southern Syria during the spring of 636 and consequently Khalid ibn al-Walid's forces withdrew from Damascus to prepare for renewed confrontation. In August, the two sides met along the Yarmouk River where they fought a major battle which ended in a decisive Muslim victory, solidifying Muslim rule in Syria and Palestine. While the Muslims administered the city, the population of Damascus remained mostly Christian—Eastern Orthodox and Monophysite—with a growing community of Muslims from Mecca, Medina, and the Syrian Desert. The governor assigned to the city which had been chosen as the capital of Islamic Syria was Mu'awiya I.\n\nUmayyad and Abbasid periods\nFollowing the fourth Rashidun caliph Ali's death in 661, Mu'awiya was chosen as the caliph of the expanding Islamic empire. Because of the vast amounts of assets his clan, the Umayyads, owned in the city and because of its traditional economic and social links with the Hijaz as well as the Christian Arab tribes of the region, Mu'awiya established Damascus as the capital of the entire Caliphate. With the ascension of Caliph Abd al-Malik in 685, an Islamic coinage system was introduced, and all the surplus revenue of the Caliphate's provinces was forwarded to the treasury of Damascus. Arabic was also established as the official language, giving the city's Muslim minority an advantage over the Aramaic-speaking Christians in administrative affairs.\nAbd al-Malik's successor al-Walid initiated the construction of the Grand Mosque of Damascus (known as the Umayyad Mosque) in 706. The site originally had been the Christian Cathedral of St. John and the Muslims maintained the building's dedication to John the Baptist. By 715, the mosque was complete. Al-Walid died that same year and was succeeded at first by Suleiman ibn Abd al-Malik and then by Umar II, who each ruled for brief periods before the reign of Hisham in 724. With these successions, the status of Damascus was gradually weakening, as Suleiman chose Ramla as his residence and Hisham chose Resafa. Following the murder of the latter in 743, the Caliphate of the Umayyads—which by then stretched from Spain to India—was crumbling as a result of widespread revolts. During the reign of Marwan II in 744, the capital of the empire was relocated to Harran in the Jazira region.\n\nOn 25 August 750, the Abbasids, having already beaten the Umayyads in the Battle of the Zab in Iraq, conquered Damascus after facing little resistance. With the heralding of the Abbasid Caliphate, Damascus became eclipsed and subordinated by Baghdad, the new Islamic capital. Within the first six months of Abbasid rule, revolts began erupting in the city, albeit too isolated and unfocused to present a viable threat. Nonetheless, the last of the prominent Umayyads were executed, the traditional officials of Damascus were ostracised, and army generals from the city were dismissed. Afterwards, the Umayyad family cemetery was desecrated and the city walls were torn down, reducing Damascus into a provincial town of little importance. It mostly disappeared from written records for the next century, and the only significant improvement of the city was the Abbasid-built treasury dome in the Umayyad Mosque in 789. In 811, distant remnants of the Umayyad dynasty staged a strong uprising in Damascus that was eventually put down.\nOn 24 November 847, a multiple earthquake struck and destroyed Damascus, killing about 70,000 people.\nAhmad ibn Tulun, a dissenting Turkish wali appointed by the Abbasids, conquered Syria, including Damascus, from his overlords in 878–79. Out of respect for the Umayyad rulers, he erected a shrine on the site of Mu'awiya's grave. Tulunid rule of Damascus was brief, lasting only until 906 before being replaced by the Qarmatians, who adhered to Shia Islam. Due to their inability to control the vast land they occupied, the Qarmatians withdrew from Damascus and a new dynasty, the Ikhshidids, took control of it. They maintained the independence of Damascus from the Arab Hamdanid dynasty of Aleppo 967. A period of instability in the city followed, with a Qarmatian raid in 968, a Byzantine raid in 970, and increasing pressures from the Fatimids in the south and the Hamdanids in the north.\n\nThe Shia Fatimids gained control in 970, inflaming hostilities between them and the city's Sunni Arabs, who frequently revolted. The Turk Alptakin drove out the Fatimids five years later, and through diplomacy, prevented the Byzantines during the Syrian campaigns of John Tzimiskes from attempting to annex the city. But by 977, the Fatimids under Caliph al-Aziz wrested control of the city back and tamed Sunni dissidents. The Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi visited Damascus in 985, remarking that the architecture and infrastructure of the city were \"magnificent\" but living conditions were awful. Under al-Aziz, the city saw a brief period of stability that ended with the reign of al-Hakim (996–1021). In 998, he executed hundreds of Damascus citizens for incitement. Three years after his mysterious disappearance, a rebellion began in southern Syria against the Fatimids but was stifled by the Fatimid Turkish governor of Syria and Palestine, Anushtakin al-Duzbari, in 1029. This victory gave him mastery over Syria, displeasing his Fatimid overlords but gaining the admiration of Damascus's citizens. He was exiled by Fatimid authorities to Aleppo, where he died in 1041. From that date to 1063, there are no known records of the city's history. By then, Damascus lacked a city administration and had an enfeebled economy and a greatly reduced population.\n\nSeljuq and Ayyubid periods\nWith the arrival of the Seljuq Turks in the late 11th century, Damascus again became the capital of independent states. It was ruled by Abu Sa'id Taj ad-Dawla Tutush I starting in 1079 and he was succeeded by his son Abu Nasr Duqaq in 1095. The Seljuqs established a court in Damascus and a systematic reversal of Shia inroads in the city. The city also saw an expansion of religious life through private endowments financing religious institutions (madrasas) and hospitals (maristans). Damascus soon became one of the most important centers of propagating Islamic thought in the Muslim world. After Duqaq died in 1104, his mentor (atabeg), Toghtekin, took control of Damascus and the Burid line of the Seljuq dynasty. Under Duqaq and Toghtekin, Damascus experienced stability, elevated status, and a revived role in commerce. In addition, the city's Sunni majority enjoyed being a part of the larger Sunni framework effectively governed by various Turkic dynasties who in turn were under the moral authority of the Baghdad-based Abbasids.\nWhile the rulers of Damascus were preoccupied in conflict with their fellow Seljuqs in Aleppo and Diyarbakir, the Crusaders, who arrived in the Levant in 1097, conquered Jerusalem, Mount Lebanon and Palestine. Duqaq seemed to have been content with Crusader's rule as a buffer between his dominion and the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt. Toghtekin, however, saw the Western invaders as a viable threat to Damascus which, at the time, nominally included Homs, the Beqaa Valley, Hauran, and the Golan Heights as part of its territories. With military support from Sharaf al-Din Mawdud of Mosul, Toghtekin managed to halt Crusader raids in the Golan and Hauran. Mawdud was assassinated in the Umayyad Mosque in 1109, depriving Damascus of northern Muslim backing and forcing Toghtekin to agree to a truce with the Crusaders in 1110. In 1126, the Crusader army led by Baldwin II fought Burid forces led by Toghtekin at Marj al-Saffar near Damascus; however, despite their tactical victory, the Crusaders failed in their objective to capture Damascus.\n\nFollowing Toghtekin's death in 1128, his son, Taj al-Muluk Buri, became the nominal ruler of Damascus. Coincidentally, the Seljuq prince of Mosul, Imad al-Din Zengi, took power in Aleppo and gained a mandate from the Abbasids to extend his authority to Damascus. In 1129, around 6,000 Isma'ili Muslims were killed in the city along with their leaders. The Sunnis were provoked by rumors alleging there was a plot by the Isma'ilis, who controlled the strategic fort at Banias, to aid the Crusaders in capturing Damascus in return for control of Tyre. Soon after the massacre, the Crusaders aimed to take advantage of the unstable situation and launch an assault against Damascus with nearly 2,000 knights and 10,000 infantry. However, Buri allied with Zengi and managed to prevent their army from reaching the city. Buri was assassinated by Isma'ili agents in 1132; he was succeeded by his son, Shams al-Mulk Isma'il who ruled tyrannically until he was murdered in 1135 on secret orders from his mother, Safwat al-Mulk Zumurrud; Isma'il's brother, Shihab al-Din Mahmud, replaced him. Meanwhile, Zengi, intent on putting Damascus under his control, married Safwat al-Mulk in 1138. Mahmud's reign then ended in 1139 after he was killed for relatively unknown reasons by members of his family. Mu'in al-Din Unur, his mamluk (\"slave soldier\") took effective power of the city, prompting Zengi—with Safwat al-Mulk's backing—to lay siege against Damascus the same year. In response, Damascus allied with the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem to resist Zengi's forces. Consequently, Zengi withdrew his army and focused on campaigns against northern Syria.\nIn 1144, Zengi conquered Edessa, a crusader stronghold, which led to a new crusade from Europe in 1148. In the meantime, Zengi was assassinated and his territory was divided among his sons, one of whom, Nur ad-Din, emir of Aleppo, made an alliance with Damascus. When the European crusaders arrived, they and the nobles of Jerusalem agreed to attack Damascus. Their siege, however, was a complete failure. When the city seemed to be on the verge of collapse, the crusader army suddenly moved against another section of the walls and was driven back. By 1154, Damascus was firmly under Nur ad-Din's control.\nIn 1164, King Amalric of Jerusalem invaded Fatimid Egypt, requested help from Nur ad-Din. The Nur ad-Din sent his general Shirkuh, and in 1166 Amalric was defeated at the Battle of al-Babein. When Shirkuh died in 1169, he was succeeded by his nephew Yusuf, better known as Saladin, who defeated a joint crusader-Byzantine siege of Damietta. Saladin eventually overthrew the Fatimid caliphs and established himself as Sultan of Egypt. He also began to assert his independence from Nur ad-Din, and with the death of both Amalric and Nur ad-Din in 1174, he was well-placed to begin exerting control over Damascus and Nur ad-Din's other Syrian possessions. In 1177 Saladin was defeated by the crusaders at the Battle of Montgisard, despite his numerical superiority. Saladin also besieged Kerak in 1183, but was forced to withdraw. He finally launched a full invasion of Jerusalem in 1187 and annihilated the crusader army at the Battle of Hattin in July. Acre fell to Saladin soon after, and Jerusalem itself was captured in October. These events shocked Europe, resulting in the Third Crusade in 1189, led by Richard I of England, Philip II of France and Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, though the last drowned en route.\nThe surviving crusaders, joined by new arrivals from Europe, put Acre to a lengthy siege which lasted until 1191. After re-capturing Acre, Richard defeated Saladin at the Battle of Arsuf in 1191 and the Battle of Jaffa in 1192, recovering most of the coast for the Christians, but could not recover Jerusalem or any of the inland territory of the kingdom. The crusade came to an end peacefully, with the Treaty of Jaffa in 1192. Saladin allowed pilgrimages to be made to Jerusalem, allowing the Crusaders to fulfill their vows, after which they all returned home. Local crusader barons set about rebuilding their kingdom from Acre and the other coastal cities.\nSaladin died in 1193, and there were frequent conflicts between different Ayyubid sultans ruling in Damascus and Cairo. Damascus was the capital of independent Ayyubid rulers between 1193 and 1201, from 1218 to 1238, from 1239 to 1245, and from 1250 to 1260. At other times it was ruled by the Ayyubid rulers of Egypt. During the internecine wars fought by the Ayyubid rulers, Damascus was besieged repeatedly, as, e.g., in 1229.\nThe patterned Byzantine and Chinese silks available through Damascus, one of the Western termini of the Silk Road, gave the English language \"damask\".\n\nMamluk period\nAyyubid rule (and independence) came to an end with the Mongol invasion of Syria in 1260, in which the Mongols led by Kitbuqa entered the city on 1 March 1260, along with the King of Armenia, Hethum I, and the Prince of Antioch, Bohemond VI; hence, the citizens of Damascus saw for the first time for six centuries three Christian potentates ride in triumph through their streets. However, following the Mongol defeat at Ain Jalut on 3 September 1260, Damascus was captured five days later and became the provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate, ruled from Egypt, following the Mongol withdrawal. Following their victory at the Battle of Wadi al-Khaznadar, the Mongols led by Ghazan besieged the city for ten days, which surrendered between 30 December 1299, and 6 January 1300, though its Citadel resisted. Ghazan then retreated with most of his forces in February, probably because the Mongol horses needed fodder, and left behind about 10,000 horsemen under the Mongol general Mulay. Around March 1300, Mulay returned with his horsemen to Damascus, then followed Ghazan back across the Euphrates. In May 1300, the Egyptian Mamluks returned from Egypt and reclaimed the entire area without a battle. In April 1303, the Mamluks managed to defeat the Mongol army led by Kutlushah and Mulay along with their Armenian allies at the Battle of Marj al-Saffar, to put an end to Mongol invasions of the Levant. Later on, the Black Death of 1348–1349 killed as much as half of the city's population.\nIn 1400, Timur, the Turco-Mongol conqueror, besieged Damascus. The Mamluk sultan dispatched a deputation from Cairo, including Ibn Khaldun, who negotiated with him, but after their withdrawal, Timur sacked the city on 17 March 1401. The Umayyad Mosque was burnt and men and women were taken into slavery. A huge number of the city's artisans were taken to Timur's capital at Samarkand. These were the luckier citizens: many were slaughtered and their heads piled up in a field outside the north-east corner of the walls, where a city square still bears the name Burj al-Ru'us (between modern-day Al-Qassaa and Bab Tuma), originally \"the tower of heads\".\nRebuilt, Damascus continued to serve as a Mamluk provincial capital until 1516.\n\nOttoman period\nIn early 1516, the Ottoman Empire, wary of the danger of an alliance between the Mamluks and the Persian Safavids, started a campaign of conquest against the Mamluk sultanate. On 21 September, the Mamluk governor of Damascus fled the city, and on 2 October the khutba in the Umayyad mosque was pronounced in the name of Selim I. The day after, the victorious sultan entered the city, staying for three months. On 15 December, he left Damascus by Bab al-Jabiya, intent on the conquest of Egypt. Little appeared to have changed in the city: one army had simply replaced another. However, on his return in October 1517, the sultan ordered the construction of a mosque, tekkiye and mausoleum at the shrine of Shaikh Muhi al-Din ibn Arabi in al-Salihiyah. This was to be the first of Damascus's great Ottoman monuments.\nDuring this time, according to an Ottoman census, Damascus had 10,423 households.\nThe Ottomans remained for the next 400 years, except for a brief occupation by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt from 1832 to 1840. Because of its importance as the point of departure for one of the two great Hajj caravans to Mecca, Damascus was treated with more attention by the Porte than its size might have warranted—for most of this period, Aleppo was more populous and commercially more important. In 1559 the western building of Sulaymaniyya Takiyya, comprising a mosque and khan for pilgrims on the road to Mecca, was completed to a design by the famous Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan, and soon afterward the Salimiyya Madrasa was built adjoining it.\n\nEarly in the nineteenth century, Damascus was noted for its shady cafes along the banks of the Barada. A depiction of these by William Henry Bartlett was published in 1836, along with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, see  Cafes in Damascus. Under Ottoman rule, Christians and Jews were considered dhimmis and were allowed to practice their religious precepts. During the Damascus affair of 1840 the false accusation of ritual murder was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus. The massacre of Christians in 1860 was also one of the most notorious incidents of these centuries when fighting between Druze and Maronites in Mount Lebanon spilled over into the city. Several thousand Christians were killed in June 1860, with many more being saved through the intervention of the Algerian exile Abd al-Qadir and his soldiers (three days after the massacre started), who brought them to safety in Abd al-Qadir's residence and the Citadel of Damascus. The Christian quarter of the old city (mostly inhabited by Catholics), including several churches, was burnt down. The Christian inhabitants of the notoriously poor and refractory Midan district outside the walls (mostly Orthodox) were, however, protected by their Muslim neighbors.\n\nAmerican Missionary E.C. Miller records that in 1867 the population of the city was 'about' 140,000, of whom 30,000 were Christians, 10,000 Jews, and 100,000 'Mohammedans' with fewer than 100 Protestant Christians. In the meantime, American writer Mark Twain visited Damascus, then wrote about his travel in The Innocents Abroad, in which he mentioned: \"Though old as history itself, thou art fresh as the breath of spring, blooming as thine own rose-bud, and fragrant as thine own orange flower, O Damascus, pearl of the East!\". In November 1898, German emperor Wilhelm II toured Damascus, during his trip to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nModern period\n20th century\nIn the early years of the 20th century, nationalist sentiment in Damascus, initially cultural in its interest, began to take a political coloring, largely in reaction to the turkicisation program of the Committee of Union and Progress government established in Istanbul in 1908. The hanging of a number of patriotic intellectuals by Jamal Pasha, governor of Damascus, in Beirut and Damascus in 1915 and 1916 further stoked nationalist feeling, and in 1918, as the forces of the Arab Revolt and the British Imperial forces approached, residents fired on the retreating Turkish troops.\n\nOn 1 October 1918, T. E. Lawrence entered Damascus, the third arrival of the day, the first being the Australian 3rd Light Horse Brigade, led by Major A.C.N. 'Harry' Olden. Two days later, 3 October 1918, the forces of the Arab revolt led by Prince Faisal also entered Damascus. A military government under Shukri Pasha was named and Faisal ibn Hussein was proclaimed king of Syria. Political tension arose in November 1917, when the new Bolshevik government in Russia revealed the Sykes-Picot Agreement whereby Britain and France had arranged to partition the Arab East between them. A new Franco-British proclamation on 17 November promised the \"complete and definitive freeing of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks.\" The Syrian National Congress in March adopted a democratic constitution. However, the Versailles Conference had granted France a mandate over Syria, and in 1920 a French army commanded by the General Mariano Goybet crossed the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, defeated a small Syrian defensive expedition at the Battle of Maysalun and entered Damascus. The French made Damascus the capital of their League of Nations Mandate for Syria.\nWhen in 1925 the Great Syrian Revolt in the Hauran spread to Damascus, the French suppressed it with heavy weaponry, bombing and shelling the city on 9 May 1926. As a result, the area of the old city between Al-Hamidiyah Souq and Medhat Pasha Souq was burned to the ground, with many deaths, and has since then been known as al-Hariqa (\"the fire\"). The old city was surrounded with barbed wire to prevent rebels from infiltrating the Ghouta, and a new road was built outside the northern ramparts to facilitate the movement of armored cars. Reporter George Seldes viewed 308 bodies, and suggested there might be more dead under the rubble—and that a maximum might be one thousand.  \"When the Muslims, who had rebelled, threatened to kill all Christians, General Maurice Sarrail gave the civilian population time to evacuate, then ordered Fort Gouraud to fire some warning shots, then shell the rebel sector.\"  \nOn 21 June 1941, 3 weeks into the Allied Syria-Lebanon campaign, Damascus was captured from the Vichy French forces by a mixed British Indian and Free French force. The French agreed to withdraw in 1946, following the British intervention during the Levant Crisis, thus leading to the full independence of Syria. Damascus remained the capital and has been unchanged even following the start of Ba'athist rule in 1963.\nIn 1979, the Old City of Damascus, with its collection of archaeological and historical religious sites, was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\n\nCivil war\nBy January 2012, clashes between the regular army and rebels reached the outskirts of Damascus, reportedly preventing people from leaving or reaching their houses, especially when security operations there intensified from the end of January into February.\nBy June 2012, bullets and shrapnel shells smashed into homes in Damascus overnight as troops battled the Free Syrian Army in the streets. At least three tank shells slammed into residential areas in the central Damascus neighborhood of Qaboun, according to activists. Intense exchanges of assault rifle fire marked the clash, according to residents and amateur video posted online.\nThe Damascus suburb of Ghouta suffered heavy bombing in December 2017 and a further wave of bombing started in February 2018, also known as Rif Dimashq Offensive.\nOn 20 May 2018, Damascus and the entire Rif Dimashq Governorate came fully under government control for the first time in 7 years after the evacuation of IS from Yarmouk Camp. In September 2019, Damascus entered the Guinness World Records as the least liveable city, scoring 30.7 points on the Economist's Global Liveability Index in 2019, based on factors such as: stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure. However, the trend of being the least liveable city on Earth started in 2017, and continued as of 2024.\n\nSyrian rebels, led by the HTS rebel group entered Damascus on 8 December 2024 after a series of offensives, capturing Sednaya Prison and later resulting in the collapse of Ba'athist Syria.\nOn 23 February 2025, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded the complete demilitarization of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Daraa and Suweyda, and the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Syrian territory south of Damascus. Syria's new government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa rejected Netanyahu's demands. Hours later, Israel conducted a wave of airstrikes in Damascus and southern Syria.\n\nEconomy\nThe historical role that Damascus played as an important trade center has changed in recent years due to political development in the region as well as the development of modern trade. Most goods produced in Damascus, as well as in Syria, are distributed to countries of the Arabian peninsula. Damascus has also held an annual international trade exposition every fall, since 1954.\nThe tourism industry in Damascus has a lot of potential, however, the civil war has hampered these prospects. The abundance of cultural wealth in Damascus has been modestly employed since the late 1980s with the development of many accommodation and transportation establishments and other related investments. Since the early 2000s, numerous boutique hotels and bustling cafes opened in the old city which attracts plenty of European tourists and Damascenes alike.\nIn 2009 new office space was built and became available on the real estate market. Marota City and Basilia City are two new development projects in Damascus. These two projects are viewed as post-war reconstruction efforts. The Damascus stock exchange formally opened for trade in March 2009, and the exchange is the only stock exchange in Syria. It is located in the Barzeh district, within Syria's financial markets and securities commission. Its final home is to be located in the upmarket business district of Yaafur.\nDamascus is home to a wide range of industrial activities, such as textile, food processing, cement, and various chemical industries. The majority of factories are run by the state, however limited privatization in addition to economic activities led by the private sector, were permitted starting in the early 2000s with the liberalization of trade that took place.\nTraditional handcrafts and artisan copper engravings are still produced in the old city.\n\nDemographics\nPopulation\nIn the 2004 Census of Population conducted by Central Bureau of Statistics (Syria), Damascus had a population of 1,552,161 living in 309,317 of its 345,097 total dwellings.\nDamascus is the center of a crowded metropolitan area with an estimated population of 5 million. The metropolitan area of Damascus includes the cities of Douma, Harasta, Darayya, Al-Tall and Jaramana.\nThe city's growth rate is higher than in Syria as a whole, primarily due to rural-urban migration and the influx of young Syrian migrants drawn by employment and educational opportunities. The migration of Syrian youths to Damascus has resulted in an average age within the city that is below the national average. Nonetheless, the population of Damascus is thought to have decreased in recent years as a result of the ongoing Syrian civil war.\n\nEthnicity\nThe vast majority of Damascenes are Syrian Arabs. The Kurds are the second largest ethnic minority, with a population of approximately 300,000. They reside primarily in the neighborhoods of Wadi al-Mashari (\"Zorava\" or \"Zore Afa\" in Kurdish) and Rukn al-Din. Other minorities include Palestinians, Armenians, Assyrians, Turkmens, Circassians and a small Greek community.\n\nReligion\nIslam is the largest religion. The majority of Muslims are Sunni while Alawites and Twelver Shi'a comprise sizeable minorities. Alawites live primarily in the neighbourhoods of Mezzeh 86 and Sumariyah part of the Mezzeh district, in addition to the neighbourhood of Eish al-Warwar in the district of Barzeh. Twelvers primarily live near the Shia holy sites of Sayyidah Ruqayya and Sayyidah Zaynab. It is believed that there are more than 200 mosques in Damascus, the most well-known being the Umayyad Mosque.\nChristians represent about 10%–15% of the population. Several Eastern Christian rites have their headquarters in Damascus, including the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Syriac Catholic Church, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, and the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch. The Christian districts in the city are Bab Tuma, Qassaa and Ghassani. Each have many churches, most notably the ancient Chapel of Saint Paul, St. Paul Cathedral, Our Lady of the Dormition Cathedral, and St Georges Cathedral in Bab Tuma. At the suburb of Soufanieh a series of apparitions of the Virgin Mary have reportedly been observed between 1982 and 2004. The Patriarchal See of the Syriac Orthodox is based in Damascus, Bab Touma.\nA smaller Druze minority inhabits the city, notably in the mixed Christian-Druze suburbs of Tadamon, Jaramana, and Sahnaya.\nThere was a small Jewish community namely in what is called Harat al-Yahud (\"the Jewish quarter\"). They are the remnants of an ancient and much larger Jewish presence in Syria, dating back at least to Roman times, if not before to the time of King David. There was once a significant Jewish community in Damascus, but as of 2023, no Jews remain.\n\nSufism\nSufism throughout the second half of the 20th century has been an influential current in the Sunni religious practises, particularly in Damascus. The largest women-only and girls-only Muslim movement in the world happens to be Sufi-oriented and is based in Damascus, led by Munira al-Qubaysi. Syrian Sufism has its stronghold in urban regions such as Damascus, where it also established political movements such as Zayd, with the help of a series of mosques, and clergy such as Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi, Sa'id Hawwa, Abd al-Rahman al-Shaghouri and Muhammad al-Yaqoubi.\n\nHistorical sites\nThe Ancient City of Damascus was inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1979. Beginning with the Aramaic kingdom (11th-7th centuries BC), Damascus grew into the political and urban hub for the region. Today, the ancient city encompasses over 125 cultural heritage sites that represent Damascus's long history, including archaeological and architectural remains from the Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Islamic, and Ottoman periods. Tragically, ongoing conflict and war continues to threaten the archaeological heritage and prevent archaeological discovery of Damascus.\n\nThe Citadel of Damascus is in the northwest corner of the Old City. The Damascus Straight Street (referred to in the account of the conversion of St. Paul in Acts 9:11), also known as the Via Recta, was the decumanus (east–west main street) of Roman Damascus, and extended for over 1,500 m (4,900 ft). Today, it consists of the street of Bab Sharqi and the Souk Medhat Pasha, a covered market. The Bab Sharqi street is filled with small shops and leads to the old Christian quarter of Bab Tuma (St. Thomas's Gate), where St George's Cathedral, the seat of the Syriac Orthodox Church, is notably located. Medhat Pasha Souq is also a main market in Damascus and was named after Midhat Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Syria who renovated the Souk. At the end of Bab Sharqi Street, one reaches the House of Ananias, an underground chapel that was the cellar of Ananias's house. The Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus, is one of the largest mosques in the world and also one of the oldest sites of continuous prayer since the rise of Islam. A shrine in the mosque is said to contain the body of St. John the Baptist. The mausoleum where Saladin was buried is located in the gardens just outside the mosque. Sayyidah Ruqayya Mosque, the shrine of the youngest daughter of Husayn ibn Ali, can also be found near the Umayyad Mosque. The ancient district of Amara is also within walking distance from these sites. Another heavily visited site is Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque, where the tomb of Zaynab bint Ali is located. Shias, Fatemids, and Dawoodi Bohras believe that after the battle of Karbala (680 AD), in Iraq, the Umayyad Caliph Yezid brought Imam Husain's head to Damascus, where it was first kept in the courtyard of Yezid Mahal, now part of Umayyad Mosque complex. All other remaining members of Imam Husain's family (left alive after Karbala) along with the heads of all other companions, who were killed at Karbala, were also brought to Damascus. These members were kept as prisoners on the outskirts of the city (near Bab al-Saghir), where the other heads were kept at the same location, now called Ru'ûs ash-Shuhadâ-e-Karbala or ganj-e-sarha-e-shuhada-e-Karbala. There is a qibla (place of worship) marked at the place, where devotees say Imam Ali-Zain-ul-Abedin used to pray while in captivity.\nThe Harat Al Yehud or Jewish Quarter is a recently restored historical tourist destination popular among Europeans before the outbreak of civil war. Vacationers can enjoy the neighborhood and scenic ancient homes abandoned by the completely departed Syrian Jewish community.\n\nWalls and gates of Damascus\nThe Old City of Damascus with an approximate area of 86.12 hectares is surrounded by ramparts on the northern and eastern sides and part of the southern side. There are seven extant city gates, the oldest of which dates back to the Roman period. These are, clockwise from the north of the citadel:\n\nBab al-Faradis (\"the gate of the orchards\", or \"of the paradise\")\nBab al-Salam (\"the gate of peace\"), all on the north boundary of the Old City\nBab Tuma (\"Touma\" or \"Thomas's Gate\") in the north-east corner, leading into the Christian quarter of the same name,\nBab Sharqi (\"eastern gate\") in the east wall, the only one to retain its Roman plan\nBab Kisan in the south-east, from which tradition holds that Saint Paul made his escape from Damascus, lowered from the ramparts in a basket; this gate has been closed and turned into Chapel of Saint Paul marking this event,\nBab al-Saghir (The Small Gate)\nBab al-Jabiya at the entrance to Souk Midhat Pasha, in the southwest.\nOther areas outside the walled city also bear the name \"gate\": Bab al-Faraj, Bab Mousalla and Bab Sreija, both to the south-west of the walled city.\n\nChurches in the old city\nChapel of Saint Paul\nHouse of Saint Ananias\nMariamite Cathedral of Damascus\nCathedral of the Dormition of Our Lady\nSaint John the Damascene Church\nSaint Paul's Laura\nSaint George's Syriac Orthodox Cathedral\n\nIslamic sites in the old city\nUmayyad Mosque, also known as the Great Mosque of Damascus\nSayyidah Ruqayya Mosque\nBab Saghir Cemetery\nMausoleum of Saladin\nNabi Habeel Mosque\n\nMadrasas\nAl-Adiliyah Madrasa\nAz-Zahiriyah Library\nNur al-Din Madrasa\n\nKhans\nKhan Jaqmaq\nKhan As'ad Pasha\nKhan Sulayman Pasha\n\nOld Damascene houses\nAzm Palace, originally built in 1750 as the residence for the Ottoman governor of Damascus As'ad Pasha al-Azm, housing the Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions.\nBayt al-Aqqad\nBayt Farhi, a large late-18th-century courtyard Jewish mansion built for the prominent Farhi family.\nMaktab Anbar, a mid-19th-century Jewish private mansion, restored by the Ministry of Culture in 1976 to serve as a library, exhibition center, museum and craft workshops.\nBeit al-Mamlouka, a 17th-century Damascene house, serving as a luxury boutique hotel within the old city since 2005.\n\nThreats to the future of the old City\nDue to the rapid decline of the population of Old Damascus (between 1995 and 2009 about 30,000 people moved out of the old city for more modern accommodation), a growing number of buildings are being abandoned or are falling into disrepair. In March 2007, the local government announced that it would be demolishing Old City buildings along a 1,400 m (4,600 ft) stretch of rampart walls as part of a redevelopment scheme. These factors resulted in the Old City being placed by the World Monuments Fund on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world. It is hoped that its inclusion on the list will draw more public awareness to these significant threats to the future of the historic Old City of Damascus.\n\nState of old Damascus\nIn spite of the recommendations of the UNESCO World Heritage Center:\n\nSouq al-Atiq, a protected buffer zone, was destroyed in three days in November 2006;\nKing Faysal Street, a traditional hand-craft region in a protected buffer zone near the walls of Old Damascus between the Citadel and Bab Touma, is threatened by a proposed motorway.\nIn 2007, the Old City of Damascus and notably the district of Bab Tuma have been recognized by The World Monument Fund as one of the most endangered sites in the world.\nIn October 2010, Global Heritage Fund named Damascus one of 12 cultural heritage sites most \"on the verge\" of irreparable loss and destruction.\n\nEducation\nDamascus is the main center of education in Syria. It is home to Damascus University, which is the oldest and largest university in Syria. After the enactment of legislation allowing private higher institutions, several new universities were established in the city and the surrounding area, including:\n\nSyrian Virtual University\nInternational University for Science and Technology\nSyrian Private University\nArab International University\nUniversity of Kalamoon\nYarmouk Private University\nWadi International University\nAl-Jazeera University\nEuropean University Damascus\nThe institutes play an important rule in the education, including:\n\nHigher Institute of Business Administration\nHigher Institute of Applied Science and Technology\nHigher Institute of Dramatic Arts\nNational Institute of Administration\nIn Damascus, Higher education in Syrian Arab Republic started with sustainable development steps through Damascus University. \n\nAdditional:\nSyrian International Academy for Training and Development\n\nTransportation\nDamascus is linked with other major cities in Syria via a motorway network. The M5 connects Damascus with Homs, Hama, Aleppo and Turkey in the north and Jordan in the south. The M1 is going from Homs onto Latakia and Tartus.\nThe M4 links the city with Al-Hasakah and Iraq. The M1 highway connects the city to western Syria and Beirut.\nThe main airport is Damascus International Airport, approximately 20 km (12 mi) away from the city, with connections to a few Middle Eastern cities. Before the beginning of the Syrian civil war, the airport had connectivity to many Asian, European, African, and, South American cities.\n\nStreets in Damascus are often narrow, especially in the older parts of the city, and speed bumps are widely used to limit the speed of vehicles. Many taxi companies operate in Damascus. Fares are regulated by law and taxi drivers are obliged to use a taximeter.\nPublic transport in Damascus depends extensively on buses and minibuses. There are about one hundred lines that operate inside the city and some of them extend from the city center to nearby suburbs. There is no schedule for the lines, and due to the limited number of official bus stops, buses will usually stop wherever a passenger needs to get on or off. The number of buses serving the same line is relatively high, which minimizes the waiting time. Lines are not numbered, rather they are given captions mostly indicating the two endpoints and possibly an important station along the line. Between 2019 and 2022, more than 100 modern buses were delivered from China as part of the international agreement. These deliveries strengthened and modernized the public transport of Damascus.\nServed by Syrian Railways, the former main railway station of Damascus was al-Hejaz railway station, about 1 km (5⁄8 mi) west of the old city. The station is now defunct and the tracks have been removed, but there still is a ticket counter and a shuttle to Damascus Qadam station in the south of the city, which now functions as the main railway station.\nIn 2008, the government announced a plan to construct a Damascus Metro. The green line will be an essential west–east axis for the future public transportation network, serving Moadamiyeh, Sumariyeh, Mezzeh, Damascus University, Hijaz, the Old City, Abbassiyeen and Qaboun Pullman bus station. A four-line metro network is expected to be in operation by 2050.\n\nCulture\nDamascus was chosen as the 2008 Arab Capital of Culture. The preparation for the festivity began in February 2007 with the establishing of the Administrative Committee for \"Damascus Arab Capital of Culture\" by a presidential decree. Museums in Damascus includes National Museum of Damascus, Azem Palace, Military Museum, October War Panorama Museum, Museum of Arabic Calligraphy and Nur al-Din Bimaristan\n\nSports and leisure\nPopular sports include football, basketball, swimming, tennis, table tennis, equestrian and chess. Damascus is home to many football clubs that participate in the Syrian Premier League including al-Jaish, al-Shorta, Al-Wahda and Al-Majd. Many Other sports clubs are located in several districts of the city: Barada SC, Al-Nidal SC, Al-Muhafaza, Qasioun SC, al-Thawra SC, Maysalun SC, al-Fayhaa SC, Dummar SC, al-Majd SC and al-Arin SC.\nThe fifth and the seventh Pan Arab Games were held in Damascus in 1976 and 1992 respectively.\nThe now modernized Al-Fayhaa Sports City features a basketball court and a hall that can accommodate up to 8,000 people. In late November 2021, Syria's national basketball team played there against Kazakhstan, making Damascus host of Syria's first international basketball tournament in almost two decades.\nThe city also has a modern golf course located near the Ebla Cham Palace Hotel on the southeastern outskirts of Damascus.\nDamascus has a busy nightlife. Coffeehouses offer Arabic coffee, tea and  nargileh (water pipes). Card games, tables (backgammon variants), and chess are activities frequented in cafés. These coffeehouses had an international reputation in the past, as indicated by Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poetical illustration, Cafes in Damascus, to a picture by William Henry Bartlett in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837. Current movies can be seen at Cinema City which was previously known as Cinema Dimashq.\n\nTishreen Park is one of the largest parks in Damascus. It is home to the annual Damascus Flower Show. Other parks include al-Jahiz, al-Sibbki, al-Tijara, al-Wahda, etc... The city's famous Ghouta oasis is also a weekend destination for recreation. Many recreation centers operate in the city including sports clubs, swimming pools, and golf courses. The Syrian Arab Horse Association in Damascus offers a wide range of activities and services for horse breeders and riders.\n\nNearby attractions\nMadaya: a small mountainous town and well-known holiday resort.\nBloudan: a town located 51 km (32 mi) north-west of Damascus, its moderate temperature and low humidity in summer attracts many visitors from Damascus and throughout Syria, Lebanon and the Persian Gulf.\nZabadani: a city close to the border with Lebanon. Its mild weather along with the scenic views, made the town a popular resort both for tourists and for visitors from other Syrian cities.\nMaaloula: a town dominated by speakers of Western Neo-Aramaic.\nSaidnaya: a city located in the mountains, 1,500 metres (4,921 ft) above sea level, it was one of the episcopal cities of the ancient Patriarchate of Antioch.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nNotable people\nSee also\nDamascus Document\nList of World Heritage in Danger\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAbdulkarim, Maamoun (2003).

      "summary": "Damascus is the capital and largest city of Syria. It is the oldest capital city in the world. Known colloquially in Syria as aš-Šām and dubbed, poetically, the \"City of Jasmine\" (مَدِيْنَةُ الْيَاسْمِينِ Madīnat al-Yāsmīn), Damascus is a major cultural center of the Levant and the Arab world.\nSituated in southwestern Syria, Damascus is the center of a large metropolitan area. Nestled among the eastern foothills of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean on a plateau 680 metres (2,230 ft) above sea level, Damascus experiences an arid climate because of the rain shadow effect. The Barada River flows through Damascus.\nDamascus is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. First settled in the 3rd millennium BC, it was chosen as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate from 661 to 750. After the victory of the Abbasid dynasty, the seat of Islamic power was moved to Baghdad. According to some, Damascus is the fourth holiest city in Islam. The city saw its importance decline throughout the Abbasid era, only to regain significant importance in the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods.\nToday, it is the seat of the central government of Syria. Damascus was named the least livable city out of 140 global cities in the Global Liveability Ranking. As of June 2023, it was the least livable out of 173 global cities in the same Global Liveability Ranking. In 2017, two new development projects were launched in Damascus to build new residential districts, Marota City and Basillia City to symbolize post-war reconstruction.",

      "content": "دِمَشْق هي عاصمه الجمهوريه العربيه السوريه، ومركز محافظه دمشق. وهي احدى اقدم مدن العالم مع تاريخ غير منقطع منذ احد عشر الف عام تقريبًا، واقدم مدينه - عاصمه في العالم. اصبحت عاصمه منطقه سوريا منذ عام 635.\nهناك عده نظريات في شرح معنى اسم دمشق، اوفرها انتشارًا كون اللفظه ساميه قديمه بمعنى الارض المسقيه؛ يعود ذلك لموقع المدينه الجغرافي في سهل خصيب يرويه نهر بردى وفروعه العديده، مشكلاً بذلك غوطه دمشق؛ وايضًا يتميز موقع المدينه بوجود جبل قاسيون فيها. اقتصرت تسميه دمشق على المدينه القديمه حتى القرون الوسطى، حين اخذت المدينه بالتوسّع خارجها، حاليًا تتالف دمشق من خمسه عشر منطقه سكنيه متصله بمحيطها من الضواحي لتشكل ما يعرف باسم دمشق الكبرى.\nالمدينه تعدّ المركز الاداري لمحافظه دمشق، بينما تتبع معظم الضواحي اداريًا لمحافظه ريف دمشق. حسب احصاءات عام 2013 فان عدد سكان دمشق بلغ 1.9 مليون نسمه، لتكون بذلك ثاني اكبر المدن السوريه بعد حلب، بينما يبلغ عدد سكان دمشق الكبرى (حسب احصاء 2010) 4.4 مليون نسمه، لتكون بذلك اكبر تجمع سكاني في سوريا، وبر الشام، وضمن اكبر عشر مدن في الوطن العربي بعد القاهره، وبغداد والرياض؛ وتبلغ مساحه المدينه 105 كم2؛ غالبيه سكان دمشق التقليديه هم من عرب سوريا على صعيد العرق، ومن المسلمين السنه على صعيد الدين. عبر التاريخ، سكنت دمشق جماعات صغيره العدد، من اصول اوروبيه - بلقانيه بشكل اساسي - وعربيه، بدواع مختلفه، انسجم اغلبها بمرور الوقت مع نسيج المدينه؛ تحوي دمشق ايضًا اعدادًا كبيره من المواطنين المنحدرين من سائر المدن والمحافظات السوريه، كمقيمين دائمين فيها. بوصفها العاصمه، فان دمشق مقر جميع الوزرات والمقرات الهامه في الدوله السوريه، بما فيها البرلمان، والمحكمه الدستوريه العليا.\nمنذ العصور القديمه، اشتهرت دمشق بوصفها مدينه تجاريه، تقصدها القوافل للراحه او التبضع، كانت المدينه احدى محطات طريق الحرير، وطريق البحر، وموكب الحج الشامي، والقوافل المتجهه الى فارس او اسيا الصغرى او مصر او الجزيره العربيه. هذا الدور الاقتصادي البارز لعب دورًا في اغناء المدينه وتحويلها الى مقصد ثقافي وسياسي ايضًا، فالمدينه كانت خلال تاريخها مركزًا لعدد من الدول اهمها الدوله الامويه - اكبر دوله اسلاميه من حيث المساحه في التاريخ، وفيها اقامت ودفنت شخصيات بارزه في تاريخ الشرق مثل صلاح الدين الايوبي والظاهر بيبرس. اما حاليًا، فيقوم اقتصاد دمشق على التجاره، والصناعه المنتشره في الضواحي، والسياحه، وقد اعتبرت دمشق عام 2010 واحده من افضل المقاصد السياحيه في العالم، الا انّ الازمه السوريه المندلعه منذ 2011، افضت الى تراجع كبير في اقتصاد المدينه، وبروز ازمات اجتماعيه واقتصاديه فيها. اعتبارًا من سبتمبر 2019،\nاي بعد مرور ما يُقارب ثماني سنوات على الحرب الاهليه، تم تصنيف دمشق على انها المدينه الاقل ملاءمهً للعيش في العالم، من قبل وحده الاستخبارات الاقتصاديه. صنفت دمشق في عام 2022 اسوا مدينه في العالم من حيث العيش.\nتُعرف ايضًا باسماء عديده منها الشام و مدينه الياسمين؛ وقد احتلت مكانه اقليميه بارزه على صعيد الفنون، والاداب، والسياسه؛ وحظيت باهتمام الادباء والشعراء والرحاله ونظم في وصفها العديد من النصوص الشعريّه والادبيّه، نذكر منهم ياقوت الحموي الذي كتب:\n\nويقول نزار قباني:\n\nاصل التسميه\nمن اقدم الوثائق التي ذكرت فيها دمشق على مرِّ التاريخ رُقم مدينه ايبلا العائده الى حوالي عام 2000 ق.م، اذ وردَ ذكرها تحتَ مُسمَّى داماسكي. كما ان ذكرها جاءَ اكثرَ من مرَّه في النصوص المصريَّه القديمه، ومن ابرزها الواح تحتمس الثالث العائده الى القرن الخامس عشر قبل الميلاد، حيثُ ذكرت باسم تيمساك، وفي رسائل تل العمارنه باسم تيماشكي. وفي الفترات التي تبعت ذلك تعاقبت عده اسماء عليها مع كل دوله جديده كانت تحكم المنطقه، فاطلق عليها الاشوريون دَمَشْقا واحياناً استخدموا اسم ايميري شو ايضًا، والاراميون كانوا يُطلقون عليها اسم ديماشقو، كما ورد اسمي دارميساك او دارميسيق في بعض النصوص الاراميه الذي قد يَعني «الدَّار/الارض المسقيه» او «المكان الوافر بالمياه» او «ارض الحجر الكلسي». ومنه في العصور الانتيكيه، عرف في اللغه اللاتينيه، ومنها اللغات الاوروبيه المعاصره ببعض التحريف في النطق ليُصبح داماسْكُس (باللاتينيه: Damascus).\nبعد الفتح الاسلامي للشام عُرفت المدينه بالكثير من الاسماء، منها دمشق الشام تمييزاً لها عن مدينه غرناطه في الاندلس التي سُميت ايضاً دمشق العرب، وذاتَ العِماد لكثره الاعمده في ابنيتها، وباب الكعبه لوُجودها على طريق مكه، والفَيْحَاء لاتساعها ورائحتها الزكيه، بالاضافه الى عده اسماء والقاب اخرى منها جِلَّق وحصن الشام وفسطاط المسلمين. كما تُسمَّى ايضاً الشام، على طريقه تسميه الفرع باسم الاصل. يُوجد خلاف كبيرٌ وافتراضات عديده بشان اصل اسم دمشق نفسه وطريقه اشتقاقه في العربيه؛ فانصار الجذر العربي للاسم يرونه ناجمًا عن مصطلح دَمْشَقَ في العربيه القديمه اي «اذا اسرع»، ولذلك يُقال ان المدينه سُميت باسمها لان «ابناءها دَمْشَقوا – اي اسرعوا – في بنائها». اما غالب المؤرخين الذين اعادوا اللفظه لكونها سريانيه، او لاتينيه، لا العربيه، فيرون انه اشتق من كلمه دُومَسْكَس بمعنى المسك او الرائحه الطيِّبه، فيما يَرى اخرون انها سُمِّيت تيمناً بالقائد اليونانيّ دماس الذي اسَّسَ المدينه، ونظراً الى ذكر المدينه في رسائل تل العمارنه والكرنك في مصر باللغه الهيروغليفيِّه تحتَ مُسمَّى دِمَشْقُوا ودَمْشَقَا؛ كما ساد الاعتقاد بان الكلمه مشتقه من اسم احد احفاد النبي نوح دَمَاشِق.\nفي الايام الراهنه، تعرف دمشق في اللهجه السوريه باسم الشام؛ اما اكثر القابها شهره فهي، مدينه الياسمين، وجلّق، والفيحاء، الى جانب عدد من الالقاب الاقل انتشارًا مثل دره الشرق، شامه الدنيا، شام شريف والتي كانت منتشره بشكل رسمي خلال سوريا العثمانيه، كنانه الله، الدار المسقيه.\n\nالتاريخ\nما قبل العصر البرونزي\nبحسب عمليات التنقيب والبحث التي تركزت في الغوطه ووادي نهر بردى فان منطقه دمشق ماهوله بالبشر منذ ما يقارب 10,000 عام اي خلال مرحله الصيد والانتقال، وقد عثر اضافه لاثار الانسان العاقل على اثار لانسان نياندرتال، وابرز ما اثر عن تلك الحقبه فؤوس ومقاحف حجريه وغيرها من الادوات اليدويه، غير ان الفتره الممتده من انقراض انسان نياندرتال قبل 40,000 عام وحتى 30,000 عام تلبث شديده الغموض في تاريخ دمشق، وكذلك في تاريخ سائر الشرق الاوسط عمومًا، ثم تعود الاثار البشريه والحضريه للظهور مع دخول العصر الزراعي قبل 30,000 عام تقريبًا، اذ عثر على العديد من القرى والمستوطنات البدائيه، خصوصًا في منطقه تل الاسود وتل الغريفه،  وقد عُثر في هاتين البقعتين من دمشق على اقدم مخازن الحبوب في العالم وبعض حبيبات من الشعير والقمح المتفحم، اما عن نمط الحياه حينها فقد بنى السكان الاوائل اكواخًا بيضويه صغيره الحجم استخدم في بنائها الطين واللبن والقصب وهي من المواد التي كانت متوفره بكثره في المستنقعات والبحيرات التي كانت تسوّر المدينه، وجفّت مع تتالي الحُقب.\nوبحسب تحليل ماده الكربون 14 فان موقع تل الرماد يرجع تاريخه الى النصف الثاني من الالف السابع قبل الميلاد وربما نحو 6300 قبل الميلاد، وقد شهدت المستوطنه البشريه تطورًا حياتيًا فاستعمل الحجر في بنائها ورصفت شوارعها بالحجاره ايضًا، وعثر في موقع تل الغريقه على اقبيه ومخازن ومواقد للشيْ، وطور السكان نظام سقايه بسيط، كما عثر ايضًا على عدد وافر من عظام الماعز والغنم وغيرها من الحيوانات المدجنه، ورغم عدم تمكن المنقبين من وضع تصور دقيق حول الفن والحياه الاجتماعيه والدين في دمشق خلال تلك الفتره، الا انّ المكتشفات تدلّ على وجود نوع من الفن وحياه اجتماعيه متكامله في كلا الموقعين. مستوطنه تل الغريقه دمرت في الالف الخامس قبل الميلاد، غير انه خلال الفتره نفسها بنيت مستوطنه ثالثه شمال الغوطه، ويشير الباحثون الى ان عددًا من السكان عاد الى التنقل بدلاً من الاستقرار بدليل اثار المنازل الضعيفه الصنع، والتي تشير الى تنقل مستمر بين المناطق، والى وفره عظام الحيوانات، ما يدلّ على امتهان الرعي. كما يشير تحليل الكربون 14 في ولعلّ تطور الحركه العمرانيه في المدينه يبدا من الالف الثاني قبل الميلاد. كانت دمشق جزءًا من مقاطعه امورو القديمه في عهد مملكه الهكسوس، ما بين 1720-1570 قبل الميلاد، وتذكر بعض السجلات المصريه القديمه من رسائل تل العمارنه حوالي 1350 قبل الميلاد، انها كانت تسمى في ذلك العهد ديماسكو، وانها تحت سيطره ملك مصر القديمه بيرياوازا. حوالي عام 1260 قبل الميلاد، اصبحت دمشق فضلا عن بقيه البلاد، ساحه معركه بين الحيثيين من الشمال والمصريين من الجنوب، وانتهت المعركه بتوقيع معاهده بين هاتوسيلي الثالث ورمسيس الثاني، والتي سلمت مقاليد السيطره على منطقه دمشق لرمسيس الثاني عام 1259 قبل الميلاد. وحوالي 1200 قبل الميلاد، وصلت شعوب البحر الى دمشق، ما وضع علامه على نهايه العصر البرونزي في المنطقه ودخول العصر الحديدي؛ والذي لم تكن دمشق فيه، في الجزء الطرفي في الصوره، بل اثرت على عدد من المراكز السكانيه في سوريا القديمه.\n\nفي سوريا الاراميه\nيعود ظهور دمشق كمدينه على جانب من الاهميه الى فتره سوريا الاراميه حوالي القرن الثاني عشر قبل الميلاد؛ اذ اسس الاراميون سلسله ممالك متحالفه مع بعضها البعض كانت ارام دمشق المذكوره في الكتاب المقدس احداها؛ ويعود لتلك الفتره اكتساب دمشق لاقدم اشكال اسمها الحالي ديماشقو. انشا الاراميون نظام توزيع للمياه، وبنوا الترع وقنوات الري على اطراف نهر بردى، وهو ما ساهم بازدهار الزراعه وزياده عدد السكان، خصوصًا من ناحيه وفود قبائل ارام زوبه من سهل البقاع المجاور لدمشق، واستقرارهم في المدينه، وهو ما جعل دمشق تابعه لمركزهم في البقاع، حتى القرن العاشر قبل الميلاد، حين تمكّن ايزرون عام 965 قبل الميلاد من الاطاحه بـارام زوبه مؤسسًا الكيان المستقل المعروف بارام دمشق؛ التي بزرت كالقوه المتفوقه في جنوب سوريا الاراميه، وسعت للتوسع واحتكار طرق التجاره مع الشرق، وحاربت مملكه اسرائيل، لاسيّما في عهد بن حدد الاول (880 - 841 قبل الميلاد)، وفي عهد خلفه حزائيل غدت باشان المعروفه اليوم باسم حوران الى مملكته؛ الا ان بن حدد الثاني فشل في حصار السامره ووقع في الاسر، ما اضطره الى فتح المجال التجاري لليهود في دمشق؛ بكل الاحوال فان التهديد الذي شكلته الامبراطوريه الاشوريه كان احد اهم اسباب عقد معاهده السلام بين ارام دمشق ومملكه اسرائيل، لمواجهه الخطر المشترك على كليهما.\nفي عام 853 قبل الميلاد، قام الملك هدادايزر من دمشق بقياده تحالف سوريا الاراميه، وقد شمل هذا التحالف قوات من شمال مملكه حماه، والقوات التي وفرها احاب ملك اسرائيل؛ واحتدم القتال في معركه قرقر ضد الجيش الاشوري، والذي انتهى بانتصار التحالف الارامي. قتل هدادايزر على يد خليفته حزائيل الثاني، وانهار التحالف المعقود مع مملكه اسرائيل، فحاولت ارام دمشق غزوا مملكه اسرائيل مجددًا لكن الغزو الاشوري الثاني افضى لالغاء الخطه. امر حزائيل الثاني بالتراجع الى الجزء المحصن من دمشق، في حين نهب الاشوريون ما تبقى من المملكه، الا انهم فشلوا من دخول مدينه دمشق ذاتها، معلنين سيادتهم على حوران والبقاع. وبحلول القرن الثامن قبل الميلاد، تمكنت الامبراطوريه الاشوريه من الاستيلاء على جميع الممالك الاراميه في سوريا بما فيها دمشق؛ وبالرغم من الاضطرابات السياسيه والثورات التي شهدتها هذه الفتره، الا ان المدينه اشتهرت كمركز تجاري وثقافي في سوريا الاراميه؛ كما ازدهرت كموقع للقوافل التجاريه نحو الشرق والجنوب؛ ولم تضمحل اللغه او الثقافه الاراميه بل انتشرت نحو الاجزاء الشرقيه من الهلال الخصيب؛ وبحلول سنه 605 قبل الميلاد اضمحلت السيطره الاشوريه بعد سقوط نينوى بيد الميديين والبابليين، الذين ورثوا حكم سوريا، التي اضحت او بعض اجزائها على الاقل ومنها دمشق ضمن نطاق سيطره الفرعون نخاو الثاني، لفتره وجيزه، الا ان الامبراطوريه البابليه الثانيه تمكنت من استعادتها بعد فتره قصيره. واصبحت المدينه لاحقا بعد صعود الاخمينيين جزا من امبراطوريتهم.\n\nفي سوريا الانتيكيه\nلحوالي الالف عام وبدءًا من 331 قبل الميلاد، كانت دمشق جزءًا من سوريا الانتيكيه، اساسًا عبر حكمي الدوله السلوقيه ثم ولايه سوريا الرومانيه؛ وخلال بعض الفترات كانت دمشق جزءًا من ممالك الحكم الذاتي السوريه، كدوله الانباط في القرن الاول، ومملكه تدمر في القرن الثالث، ويذكر ان سكان دمشق استنجدوا بالملك النبطي الحارث الثالث عام 84 لحمايتهم من قطاع الطرق، وبذلك بلغت الدوله النبطيه اقصى اتساعها. واكتسبت دمشق وضع مدينه حرّه، وهو ما كان يعفيها من الضرائب ويشجّع فيها التجاره، وشكلت حلف المدن العشر او «الديكابوليس» بدءًا من القرن الاول قبل الميلاد؛ ومنحت في عهد الامبراطور هادريان وضح متروبول اي مدينه كبرى، وان لم تكن مركزًا لولايه حتى عام 400 حين قسّم البيزنطيون البلاد الى اربعه ولايات، والتي كانت دمشق بموجبها عاصمه ولايه فينيقيا الثانيه. ولعلّ اكبر كارثه حلّت بالمدينه، الاجتياح الفارسي عام 614 بقياده كسرى الثاني، والذي انتهى عام 629 حين تمكن هرقل من طرد الفرس في سوريا.\n\nمكثت دمشق سريانيه اللغه والثقافه في العصور الانتيكيه، رغم انتشار اليونانيه فيها لاسيّما في الطبقات العليا، ولم تحلّ لغه الانثقاف مكان اللغه الاصليه كما حصل في مناطق عديده لاسيّما في الساحل، وبرزت من دمشق شخصيات سوريه يونانيه الثقافه على مستوى الامبراطوريه مثل ابولودور؛ وشهدت دمشق في مرحله سوريا الانتيكيه، ازدهارًا عمرانيًا، وتخطيطًا على نمط هيبوداموس وتوسعًا، واحتوت كعواصم العالم الاغريقي، مسارح، وساحات لسباق الخيل، وحمامات، واقواس نصر، ومدافن فخمه، ويعود لتلك الحقبه من تاريخ دمشق، نمو سورها، وابوابها، ويضيف بعض المؤرخين قلعتها. خلال مرحله ما قبل الميلاد، انتشرت عباده الاله الارامي حدد - وهو المقابل لجوبتير الروماني، وزيوس اليوناني، ضمن سياسه توفيق الالهه - في المدينه؛ ووصف بكونه سيّد دمشق، وشيّد على اسمه معبد جوبتير؛ ووجدت في دمشق جماعات ضخمه من يهود سوريا من مرحله قبل الميلاد، وانتشرت فيها المسيحيه منذ قرنها الاول، وحسب سفر اعمال الرسل، فان القديس بولس، تحوّل الى المسيحيه قرب دمشق،اع 9:3] ومنها انطلق في النشاط التبشيري، بعد ان تمّت تدليته في سله من احدى نوافذ السور، اذ اراد الحاكم القاء القبض عليه وقتله.2كو 11:33]\n\nالخلافه الراشده والامويه\nفي سبتمبر 635م فتح خالد بن الوليد دمشق سلمًا بعد سته اشهر من الحصار، ومنح في اثرها الامان لسكانها حسب صكّ التسليم المبرم بينه وبين اسقفها سرجون بن منصور؛ وهو الصك الذي استسلمت بموجبه سائر المدن السوريه؛ وفي العام التالي (13هـ/636م) وقعت معركه اليرموك الحاسمه في تاريخ فتوح الشام. بعد الفتح استقرّ الولاه في دمشق، وبذلك انتقلت عاصمه البلاد من انطاكيه اليها؛ وبعد اربع سنوات من الفتح عيّن معاويه بن ابي سفيان واليًا على دمشق، خلفًا لاخيه يزيد بن ابي سفيان؛ وخلال فتنه مقتل عثمان اعلن معاويه التمرد على الخليفه علي بن ابي طالب، واستقلّ بحكم الشام، وبسط نفوذه في مصر عبر عامله عمرو بن العاص، وبعد خمس سنوات من القتال، انتهت الحرب في عام الجماعه (40هـ) باعلان الدوله الامويه وعاصمتها دمشق؛ وبذلك يكون معاويه قد حكم دمشق اربعين عامًا عشرون منها كوالي، وعشرون اخرى كخليفه.\n\nوخلال «الفتنه الثانيه» والتي كان قائدها في دمشق يزيد بن معاويه، نقل الى دمشق راس الامام الحسين وعدد من نساء اهل البيت منهم السيده زينب؛ كما استقر في دمشق عدد من زوجات النبي، والصحابه، ودفنوا فيها. خلال الصراع بين فروع الاسره الامويه على الحكم وقعت معركه مرج راهط قرب دمشق بين اتباع الامويين واتباع عبد الله بن الزبير، والتي ثبتت البيت المرواني وزعيمه مروان بن الحكم في السلطه؛ وفي اعقاب حكمه لا سيّما ايام ابنه عبد الملك، وحفيديه الوليد وهشام، عاشت دمشق ازهى ايامها، فمع توسع الدوله وتدفق اموال الجبايه على عاصمتها تكاثرت في دمشق القصور والحمامات وغيرها من المباني والمحال العامه، ويروي المؤرخون ان الناس اذا التقوا بعضهم في ايّام الوليد وهشام، كان حديثهم عن العماره، وفنون البناء، ومجمل ما يمكن استنتاجه من خلال مصادر المؤرّخين، ان مدينه دمشق في العهد الاموي كانت تحفل بحلّه جميله بعد ان نعمت بالمركز الممتاز، والخير العميم، والازدهار الاقتصادي، ويحدّث المؤرخون عن احواض المياه والنواعير والسّقايات التي كانت منبّثه على اطراف الشوارع، وعلى ابواب المباني العامّه، وفي الاسواق والسّاحات، وعند ابواب المدينه، ولقد عدّد ابن عساكر عشرين منها كانت باقيه الى عهده يرجع اكثرها الى عصر بني اميّه؛ ولعلّ «دار الاماره» التي شيدها معاويه لتكون مقرًا له والتي سميت ايضًا «الدار الخضراء» نظرًا لقبتها الخضراء، احدى اول وابرز المشاهد العمرانيه الامويّه في المدينه، كما شيّد الامويون مستشفيان كبيران داخل المدينه ودارًا للخيول.\nوبنى الوليد الجامع الاموي واسرف في تزينه بالفسيفساء، وكذلك الحال في حلب، وكان الجامع الاموي مسجد دمشق الوحيد داخل الاسوار الى جانب مصليين صغيرين خارجها، ولم يبن الامويون سواهم. ونتيجه هذا الازدهار استقر حولها على ضفاف نهر بردى عدد من القبائل، وشقّ «نهر يزيد» من نهر بردى لتامين الريّ لمساحه اكبر من الاراضي؛ كما اهتمّ الوليد ايضًا بالطرقات وربط المدن بعضها ببعض لا سيّما بين دمشق والباديه، حيث شيّد الامويون ما يزيد عن عشرين قصرًا للتنزه وممارسه الرياضات المختلفه، وشهدت المدينه بالتزامن مع ذلك نهضه ثقافيّه. وبعد وفاه هشام اصيبت الدوله بالتصدع، وتعاقب عليها ضعاف الخلفاء، واندلعت فيها فتن داميه بين العرب من القيسيه واليمنيه، وخلع البيت الاموي نفسه خليفتين، ونقل مروان بن محمد اخر الامويين، عاصمته الى حران، ولم يتوقف تداعي صرح الدوله في عهده، وبختام العصر الامويّ زال عهد دمشق الذهبي.\n\nالخلافه العباسيه\nتابعت قوات الثوره العباسيه تقدمها في املاك الدوله بعد انتصارها على الامويين في معركه الزاب عام 749م، حتى فرضت حصارًا على دمشق دام شهرًا ونصف الشهر، ثم تمكّن المحاصِرون من نقب السور عند باب الصغير، وفتحت المدينه للعباسيين، الذين ارتكبوا فيها قسطًا وافرًا من عمليات القتل، والنهب، والتدمير، وقد ذكرها مؤرخو تلك الفتره ومنهم المقدسي. وقد اهملت المدينه في العصر العباسي الاول، ولم تول ايه اهميه، وشهدت عده ثورات ضد الولاه العباسيين، منها ثوره عثمان الازدي عام 753، وثوره 850 ضد المتوكل على الله لما مارسه واليها من «استذلال» لاهلها، ثم عام 868 بقياده عيسى بن الشيخ الذي اعلنها دوله مستقله استمرت حتى عام 896، حيث كلف المعتمد على الله اماجور التركي بالقضاء على دوله عيسى بن الشيخ، وهو ما تمّ له فعلاً. كذلك فقد اندلعت فتن وحروب اهليه بين القيسيه واليمانيه داخل المدينه بين 792 - 796، وفي عام 802 ايضًا. ويذكر انّ المتوكل على الله اراد نقل حاضره الخلافه من سامراء الى دمشق، وكتب لواليه فيها بذلك، غير انه لم يمكث فيها سوى شهرين وعاد الى سامراء تحت ضغط رجال دولته الاتراك. ولم يترك العباسيون اثرًا معماريًا هامًا في المدينه باستثناء ما ذهب اليه عدد من المؤرخين بان قبه الخزنه في الجامع الاموي انما بنيت في خلافه محمد المهدي عام 774.\n\nخلال القرن العاشر الذي تميّز بضعف الدوله في بغداد، وانتشار الدويلات المستقله في ارباضها، تتالى على حكم دمشق الطولونيون حتى عام 906، ثم الاخشيديون، وتعرضت المدينه في عهدهم لغارات شنها القرامطه والبيزنطيون؛ وتلا الاخشيد الحمدانيون 968 حين استعادها الاخشيد مجددًا عام 967، وكانت جزءًا من املاك خلفائهم الفاطميين حتى 947، حين استنجد اهل دمشق بالقائد التركي افتكين الذي وصل حمص، فزحف منها الى دمشق للسيطره عليها، وقد وقعت اثنتي عشره معركه بين افتكين والقائد الفاطمي جوهر، كان اخرها معركه الشاغور، التي خرجت بنتيجتها الشام عن حكم الفاطميين؛ الا انهم عادوا بعد فتره قصيره، وساءت ايام الفاطميين احوال المعيشه وهجرها السكان بنتيجه الغلاء، فانخفض عدد قاطنيها بشكل كبير، وقامت ثورات احداث عامي 982 و999، واستمرّ حكم الفاطميين حتى 1075 حين سيطر عليها السلاجقه، بقياده تتش بن الب ارسلان ثم ابنه دقاق؛ اهتم السلاجقه بالناحيه الدينيه في دمشق خصوصًا اثر انتشار المذهب الشيعي في اعقاب سيطره الفاطميين على المدينه، فانشؤوا عددًا من المدارس الدينيه مجانًا، كما اعتنوا ببناء البيمارستانات، وقد تحولت دمشق الى دوله سلجوقيه مستقله بعد انفراط عقد الدوله السلجوقيه الموحده الى مجموعه من الدول المسيطره على المدن الكبرى في الشام.\n\nبعد نجاح الحمله الصليبيه الاولى في تاسيس امارات لها في الساحل الشامي، بلغت حدود مملكه بيت المقدس اطراف دمشق الجنوبيه في الجولان، وتعرضت حوران لغارات عديده من قبلهم، وهو ما هدد امن دمشق واقتصادها، لكون حوران مصدر قمحها؛ وابرمت دمشق السلجوقيه عام 1110 هدنه مع مملكه بيت المقدس، وفي 1129 اتهم السلاجقه الاسماعيليون بالخيانه وقتل 6,000 اسماعيلي من سكان المدينه مع قادتهم؛ وشهد عام 1132 انتقام الاسماعيليه باغتيال تاج الدين البوري، حاكم دمشق السلجوقي؛ واستغلّ صليبيو القدس الوضع مجهزين جيشًا من 60,000 جندي للهجوم على المدينه، فقام تاج الدين بوري بالتحالف مع عماد الدين زنكي بهدف منع تقدم الجيش وهو ما نجح في تحقيقه؛ وفي عام 1148 ضربت الحمله الصليبيه الثانيه حصارًا حول دمشق الا انه باء بالفشل بجهود نور الدين زنكي حاكم حلب، الذي عاد فخلع السلاجقه عام 1154 موحدًا سوريا تحت حكمه؛ وبعد وفاه نور الدين واندثار الدوله الزنكيه، تبعت دمشق حكم صلاح الدين والدوله الايوبيه التي شملت في عهده الشام، ومصر، والحجاز، واليمن؛ الا انه بعد وفاته عام 1193 انقسمت دولته بين الورثه، فكانت دمشق دوله ايوبيه مستقله بين 1193 - 1201، و1218 - 1245، و1250 - 1260. خلال فتره الحروب الصليبيه، اكتسبت دمشق سمعه كبيره لدى الصليبيين، فالحرير والخشب المزخرف والمطعم وغيرها من سلع الرفاهيه انما كانت تنقل عبر دمشق ومنها الى اوروبا.\n\nعهد السلطنه المملوكيه\nاعتبر المماليك الذين حكموا البلاد بدءًا من 1250 دمشق ثاني مدنهم بعد القاهره لموقعها الحربي وغنى اراضيها؛ واعتبروها مركز نيابه بلاد الشام. وتتالت على دمشق في القرن الثالث عشر غزوات المغول المتلاحقه، واشدها «غزوه غازان» التي وقعت في عام 1300، وقد بلغ عدد قتلى سكان المدينه حوالي مائه الف شخص حسب ما نقل عن قدماء المؤرخين، الى جانب احراق مكتباتها واسواقها، غير انهم فشلوا في اقتحام قلعتها لمناعه موقعها وحصانه سورها المزدوج، فخرجوا من المدينه واعيدت الخطبه لسلطان مصر.\n\nوفي عام 1402، قام المغول بحمله ثانيه على دمشق بقياده تيمورلنك، وقد احرقت المدينه بما فيها الجامع الاموي، وسُبي منها بنتيجه الحمله عدد وافر من الصنّاع والحرفيين والعلماء الى سمرقند، فساهموا بنهضتها الثقافيه. وفي عهد السلطان برسباي (1422 - 1438) اصيبت بلاد الشام بدءًا من حلب وانتهاءً بالكرك بوباء مجاعه، حتى مات الناس من الجوع او من الطاعون، ولعلّ عدم ايلاء المماليك للزراعه الاهتمام الكافي من ساهم في انتشاره، ويقول نقولا زياده انه لو لم تكن دمشق غزيره المياه وخصبه الاراضي لما عادت اليها الحياه المزدهره بسرعه ما كان، على ان المماليك لم يهملوا الزراعه فحسب بل الامن ايضًا وباستثناء قلعه دمشق التي يتولى شؤون حراستها حاميه معينه من القاهره، فان احياء دمشق وحاراتها كانت معرضه لغزو البدو وقطاع الطرق، هذا ما دفع اهالي الاحياء لتسليح انفسهم وتنظيم فرق من اهالي الحيْ تتولى الدفاع عن الحي، ثم اصبح لهذه القوى من الامن ذاتي ما يشبه نقابات خاصه؛ كذلك فقد حُصر بال السيوفي منصب شيخ المدينه، يتناقله اعضائها بالوراثه، ومن مهام شيخ المدينه تمثيل الاهالي ومطالبهم امام الوالي، والتوسط لهم في القضايا المختلفه. رغم ذلك فان عدد سكان المدينه كان ينمو باطراد وحينها كان حي الصالحيه اكبرها، اضافه الى ظهور احياء جديده وضواحي على اطرافها، والى جانب النمو الديموغرافي فان نموًا اقتصاديًا شهدته المدينه خلال القرنين الرابع عشر والخامس عشر، وقامت عدد من الاسواق كسوق الدباغين وسوق الخيل وسوق ساروجه الذي كان اكبرها واسرعها نموًا. وقد اهتم المماليك بتاسيس المدارس الشرعيه الاسلاميه ومنها المدرسه الظاهريه التي اشتهرت بزخرفتها، واداروا سته مستشفيات كبيره تعرف باسم «البيمارستان» خلال مده حكمهم، ومنذ القرن الخامس عشر غدت دمشق مركزًا هامًا للصوفيين، وقد برز من المدينه خلال حكم المماليك عدد من الشعراء والمؤرخين والفقهاء وغيرهم.\n\nفي سوريا العثمانيه\nاوليت دمشق اهميه خاصه خلال زمن الدوله العثمانيه ولقبت «بالشام الشريف»؛ وبعد معركه مرج دابق، دخل السلطان سليم الاول دمشق يوم 26 سبتمبر 1516، وكان اول اعماله ترميم الجامع الاموي؛ وقضى السلطان سليم في دمشق فترتين الاولى عام 1516، والثانيه بعد عودته من مصر عام 1517، حيث انفق معظمها في تنظيم الشؤون الاداريه للولايه، وفي عام 1524 ثارت دمشق بقياده واليها جان بردي الغزالي، وانضمت اليها مدن اخرى كحمص وحماه، فسار فرحات باشا والي حلب بامر من سليمان القانوني اليها، فقضى على التمرد قبل امتداده.\nبين العصرين المملوكي والعثماني استمرت الكتابه في مصنفات تربيه الاطفال وتاديبهم، ونذكر من مصنفات تلك الحقبه ابن حجر الهيتمي (974-909هـ/1566 – 1503 م) الذي وضع وهو في مكه مصنفه الشهير\"تحرير المقال في اداب واحكام وفوائد يحتاج اليها مؤدبو الاطفال. ويبين الهيتمي في مؤلفه هذا ما يحتاج اليه مؤدبو الاطفال من المعارف المتصله بالتربيه، ويعرض لاهم المبادئ التربويه التي توجه عمل المؤدبين في دور العلم.\nووقف المؤرخون الدمشقيون اللاحقون (م1546) امام انتشار ظاهره فساد الاخلاق في فتره القرن الذي سبقهم، والتي كانت محل استهجان ورفض ونقد لموقف السلطه السياسيه منها، وبخاصه فيما يتصل بارتكاب الفواحش والجهر بها من شرب الخمر، وممارسه اللواط، وانتشار بنات الهوى في الاسواق.\nويكشف ابن طولون الصالحي (ت:953هـ/1546م) بان لبنات الهوى بيوتاً خاصه بهن؛ اذ يذكر في احداث شهر جمادى الاولى سنه 885هـ/ تموز 1480م انه تم تخريب «..بيوت بنات الخطا بين جامع التوبه وجامع الجديد بعد ان اشتريت القيساريه من ابن الصقر التاجر بمبلغ ثلاثين اشرفيه، ثم انتقلت بنات الخطا الى جوار المدرسه اليونسيه بالشرف الاعلى» \nغير ان اهتمام العثمانيين بالمدينه لم ينقص، فشيّدوا التكيه السليمانيه، ورمموا حي الصالحيه، الذين لا يزالا ماثلين الى اليوم، كاحد منجزات العثمانيين المعماريه المبكره في سوريا، ولم يكن استقرار الولاه من شيم العهد العثماني، وهكذا تعاقب على دمشق في 148 سنه الاولى من حكم العثمانيين فيها ما لا يقلّ عن 138 واليًا ولم يدم منهم في وظيفته مده سنتين الا ثلاثه وثلاثون واليا؛ وبين عامي 1815 و1895 توالى 61 والي بمعدل والي في كل سنه ونصف. وكان الولاه دائمي النزاع مع الولايات المجاوره، فعلى سبيل المثال نشبت الحرب بين والي دمشق ووالي طرابلس الشام بين عامي 1664 و1667.\n\nاصبحت دمشق ميناءً بريًا للقوافل التجاريه بين مختلف مناطق الدوله، وحسب شهاده الرحاله الفرنسي لوران دارفيو في القرن السابع عشر، فان سكّان دمشق يحبون العيش برفاهه واقتناء الاثاث الفاخر، وان منازل المدينه توحي بالعظمه لروعتها، اما فيما يخصّ التجاره فقد كتب درافيو ان دمشق واحده من الاسواق الرئيسيه في الدوله العثمانيه فهي محط القوافل التجاريه القادمه من مكه والهند وبلاد فارس محمّله بمختلف السلع، ومكان لصناعه الاقمشه التي اشتهرت بها المدينه. والى جانب القوافل التجاريّه، فان المدينه والتي كانت نقطه تجمّع لقوافل الحجاج المسلمين، قد اعتمدت على قوافل الحج في تامين الوفره النقديه وتنشيط عمليات البيع والشراء. لسوء الحظ، فان قوافل الحج في اواسط القرن الثامن عشر قد تعرضت لهجمات من قبل البدو او من قبل مقاتلي الحركه الوهابيه وفشل الولاه المتعاقبون في الغالب في تامين الحجيج ولعلّ اكبر الحوادث ما وقع عام 1757 حين نهبت القافله التي كانت تحوي ستين الف حاج بكامل ما تحمل. ونتيجه انعدام الامن خلال تلك المرحله انخفض عدد الحجاج الى نحو الفي حاج فقط ما اثر على اقتصاد دمشق بشكل بالغ السوء.\nفي عام 1724 اسندت ولايه دمشق الى اسماعيل باشا العظم وهو «خير وال عرفته المدينه في العصر العثماني»، وله يعود تشيييد قصر العظم الذي اعتبره فيليب حتي «اروع اثر عربي في القرن الثامن عشر»، وفي عام 1771 دخلت المدينه في حوزه والي عكا ضاهر العمر الا انه اضطر للتنازل عنها سلمًا في العام التالي. وفي عام 1782 غدا احمد باشا الجزار واليًا وكان حكمه قاسيًا اذ اضنك الشعب بالضرائب وضاعف من الاتاوه على التجار، واصيبت دمشق وغوطتها بالقحط والجفاف عام 1793، وحين اعيد تعيينه واليًا عام 1803 اغلق اهل دمشق باب المدينه في وجه مندوبه سليمان باشا، ولذلك فرض عليهم غرامات طائله وصادر املاكهم ومكث واليًا الى ان توفي عام 1804 قبل ان يعود الولاه العثمانيين المتعاقبين على تسيير شؤونها.\n\nوفي فبراير 1831 ثارت دمشق بعد اعلان الوالي ضريبه جديده اعتبرها السكان باهظه، وشكّل اهالي حي الميدان ذي الغالبيه الفقيره نواه المنتفضين، الذين قاموا بمحاصره الوالي وكبار حاشيته في القلعه، ثم اقتحموها قاتلين الوالي وكبار حاشيته، وساحلين جثته جارين اياها من حي الى حي في شوارع دمشق.\nوفي العام نفسه، دخل ابراهيم باشا دمشق سلمًا باسم والده والي مصر محمد علي باشا، وكان حكم ابراهيم باشا في الشام اصلاحيًا من مختلف الجوانب، رغم الفتره القصيره التي مكث بها في السلطه، اذ اضطر للانسحاب بضغط القوى الكبرى العسكري في 17 سبتمبر 1840. في عام 1845 نهب البدو قافله تجار دمشق المتوجهه الى بغداد وكانت مكونه من ثلاثه الاف جمل فافلس تجار المدينه واصبحت طريق التجاره مع بغداد تمرّ بحلب والموصل اي اطول مما كانت عليه بثلاث مرات، وفي عام 1851 طبّق نظام التجنيد الاجباري للمره الاولى بعد سقوط حكم محمد علي مع ما تركه من اثار سلبيه تمثلت بالهجره الداخليّه والخارجيّه على حد سواء وتراجع الاقتصاد وقسمه العائلات للحصول على اعفاء الرجل الوحيد؛ وشهدت دمشق مجازر 1860 التي افضت لقتل الاف المسيحيين؛ على انّ الهزيع الاخير من القرن التاسع عشر كان عهد نهضه، لاسيّما في عهود الولاه المصلحين امثال مدحت باشا، وغدت دمشق خلال تلك الفتره، احدى ميادين النهضه العربيه وتاسست بها صحف ومجلات، وانتشرت المدارس واسست نواه الجامعه السوريه، والجمعيات السياسيه، والمسرح برعايه ابو خليل القباني، وتزايدت الاثار العمرانيه وشقت ساحات المدينه البازره امثال ساحه المرجه فضلاً عن انطلاق سكه حديد الحجاز والاتصال بالتلغراف معها.\n\nدمشق المعاصره\nعانت دمشق خلال الحرب العالميه الاولى من ضنك العيش بنتيجه المجاعه التي اجتاحت البلاد وموجات الهجره، فضلاً عن كونها مقر الجيش العثماني الخامس، وتعسّف الحاكم العسكري جمال باشا السفّاح، الذي اسس ديوانًا للاحكام العرفيه فيها، وبلغ ذروه قرارته باعدام سبعه من وجهاء المدينه في 6 مايو 1916 وهو ما تحوّل الى عيد للشهداء. في 30 سبتمبر 1918 انسحبت القوات العثمانيه والوالي العثماني من دمشق مؤذنًه بانتهاء عصر سوريا العثمانيه. وفي اليوم التالي وصلتها قوات من جيش الثوره العربيه الكبرى، وبعدها بايام فيصل بن الحسين، الذي نصّب في دمشق يوم 8 اذار/مارس 1920 ملكًا على سوريا (التي كانت تعني كامل بلاد الشام) خلال حفل اعلان الاستقلال وانشاء المملكه السوريه العربيه. غير ان عهد الاستقلال لم يستمرّ طويلاً، اذ دخلت القوات الفرنسيه دمشق بعد معركه ميسلون في 24 يوليو 1920، وفي سبتمبر اعلنت دوله دمشق المصغّره ضمن خطه الانتداب الفرنسي لتقسيم سوريا الى دويلات. في عام 1922 نقلت عاصمه البلاد الى حمص ضمن الاتحاد السوري، على ان تبقى دمشق عاصمه اقليم دمشق فقط، وهو ما الغي عام 1925 بعوده دمشق عاصمه الدوله السوريه.\nعام 1925 وصلت الثوره السوريه الكبرى الى دمشق، وتحولت الغوطه الى احدى معاقلها الرئيسيه، ولعلّ ابرز مرحله في تلك الفتره احداث 18 اكتوبر حين استولى الثوار على احياء الميدان والشاغور ووصلوا حتى سوق البزوريه وقصر العظم مقر مندوبي المفوضيّه الفرنسيّه العليا، وطردوا جميع عناصر الشرطه واستطاعوا الاستيلاء على ما فيها من اسلحه، وبلغ التماس ساحه المرجه، الا ان قصف المدينه بالمدفعيه الثقيله من قاسيون اجبر المقتحمين على الانسحاب. في 1936 كانت دمشق شراره الاضراب الستيني، وبعدها انطلقت منها احتجاجات 1939، التي افضت لنزول وحدات الجيش الفرنسي السنغاليه واحتلالها ساحات المدينه. خلال الحرب العالميه الثانيه، نشبت معركه دمشق عام 1941 والتي افضت لسيطره الحلفاء ممثلين بالجيش البريطاني وقوات فرنسا الحره على المدينه. بعد نهايه الحرب العالميه الثانيه، اندلعت من دمشق انتفاضه الاستقلال التي شهدت قصف دمشق للمره الثانيه، ونزول قوات بريطانيه فيها، وبشكل عام ادت الانتفاضه لنيل الجلاء. بعد الاستقلال كانت دمشق مسرحًا لعدد من الانقلابات العسكريه اهمها انقلاب اذار 1949 وانقلاب 1954، الذي انطلق من حلب وادى الى حاله فوضى في دمشق لمده يومين تخللتها عمليات سلب ونهب. وكرد فعل على حرب فلسطين وانشاء اسرائيل، شهدت المدينه عام 1948 احتجاجات ومظاهرات تعرضت خلالها مواقع لليهود في المدينه وعدد من مقار البعثات الدبلوماسيه، بما فيها مقر الامم المتحده، لعمليات نهب واعتداء، وكان اكبر هذه الاعتداءات تفجير كنيس المنشاره. خلال تمرد الاخوان المسلمين في الثمانينات، وقعت في دمشق عده تفجيرات بين 1981 - 1986، واستهدافات بالسيارات المفخخه كان اكبرها تفجير الازبكيه. تاثرت المدينه بالصراع مع اسرائيل، فتعرضت دمشق الكبرى لاستهدافات صهيونيه في ازمنه الحرب، مثل حرب حزيران 1967، وخارج ازمنه الحرب مثل اغتيال عماد مغنيه عام 2008 وقصف مركز البحوث العلميه في جمرايا مرتين في 2013.\nتطورت المدينه على صعيد الخدمات والتخطيط العمراني وزادت المرافق العامه وغدت اكثر حداثه، وبرزت المشاريع المعماريه الضخمه فيها؛ كما افضت الهجره من الريف الى المدينه والنزوح من الجولان وفلسطين الى نشوء ضواحٍ سكنيه ملحقه بدمشق مثل مخيم اليرموك والحجر الاسود.\n\nالثوره السوريه\nاندلعت الازمه السوريه في مارس 2011، وشهدت دمشق احتجاجات سلميه لمدَّه سنه كامله، قابلها النظام بعنف مفرط، ممَّا انشا انواع مختلفه من الاحتجاجات المعارضه، التي تحولت الى نزاع مسلح مع النظام؛ في 6 يناير 2012 انفجرت اول سياره مفخخه في دمشق ما اسفر عن مقتل 26 شخصًا؛ وتكررت عمليات الاستهداف فيما بعد ولعلّ عمليه بركان دمشق وزلزال سوريا، التي استهدفت قيادات بارزه في النظام، اهم عمليه تفجير داخل المدينه. ايضًا، فان المعارك الحربيه، احتدمت في مناطق ريف دمشق، عازلهً المدينه عن اجزاء واسعه من ريفها، وعن بعض ضواحيها، وافضت لحركه نزوح واسعه الى المدينه؛ وبشكل عام تكررت الاشتباكات والمعارك في ريف دمشق وبعض ضواحي المدينه نفسها كمخيم اليرموك، وكذلك الاستهدافات بالسيارات المفخخه، وبقذائف الهاون والصواريخ، ما بعد مرحله تحول الازمه الى صيغه العسكره الكامله؛ في حين عانت المدينه من الغلاء، وانقطاع الطرق، وانتشار الحواجز الامنيه بشكل كثيف اضافه الى نزوح الالاف من المناطق المحيطه بدمشق الى المناطق الامنه.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالتشكل الجيولوجي\nبدا تشكل المنطقه التي تحتلها دمشق حاليًا منذ العصر الطباشيري، وتشير المعلومات المتوافره انه مع بدايه الزمن الرابع كانت تغطي المنطقه بحيره واسعه امتدت من الكسوه حتى الضمير، وكانت شواطئها اعلى من شواطئ بحيره العتيبه الحاليه بحوالي 125 مترًا، ويقوم نهر بردى ونهر الاعوج برفدها بالمياه باستمرار اضافه الى الامطار والاوديه الفرعيه والانهار الموسميه الاخرى، ما ادى الى قيام مناخ بارد وماطر وانتشار غابات كثيفه. منذ حوالي 500,000 سنه حصل جفاف نسبي في المناخ فتراجعت مياه البحيره حتى بلغ ارتفاعها 15 مترًا فقط، وادى تراجعها الى تشكل تربه غوطه دمشق ومنطقه التربه السوداء الخصبتين نتيجه جمله نشاطات سيليه حتيه، ولم يبق من هذه البحيره سوى بحيره العتيبه حاليًا، مع العلم انه قبل حوالي 10,000 سنه حصل جفاف مناخي اخر ادى الى تراجع مستوى ما تبقى من البحيره لحدود 6 امتار فقط.\n\nالموقع\nدمشق مدينه داخليه تبعد حوالي 80كم عن البحر الابيض المتوسط قباله سلسله جبال لبنان الشرقيه، وتقع على هضبه بارتفاع 690م عن سطح البحر، وتبعد عنها بيروت 85 كم الى الغرب، وكل من عمان 180 كم والقدس 220 كم الى الجنوب. وقد نوّه الجغرافيون والرحاله لحسن موقعها منذ القديم، حيث ان المياه المتوفره بكثره من الانهار والينابيع والتربه الخصبه والمناخ المعتدل، ساهمت في عمران المدينه وازدهارها؛ ومما قاله فيها ابن حوقل: «هي اجمل مدينه من مدن الشام تقع في ارض مستويه.» تمتد المدينه من السفح الجنوبي لجبل قاسيون نحو الشرق الى الباديه وتحيط بها الغوطه من جميع الجهات، فهي قائمه في وسط الغوطه. كانت البساتين الخصبه سبب وجود دمشق الاساسي وغناها عبر العصور، مرتويه من فروع نهري بردى في الشمال، والاعوج في الجنوب، وكلاهما شديدي التشعب في سواقٍ تغطي المدينه والغوطه ايضًا. يتغذى كلا النهرين من ذوبان ثلوج سلسله لبنان الشرقيه، لاسيّما جبل الشيخ، الذي اكتسب اسمه لكونه مجللاً دومًا بالثلج الابيض. يشكل جبل الشيخ ايضًا، مع سلسلته الجبليه، النهايه والحد لسهول دمشق الخصبه من ناحيه الغرب. اما الجبل المحيط بالمدينه بحد ذاتها من ناحيه الغرب ايضًا ليشكل «اسوره دمشق» فهو جبل قاسيون، الذي تبلغ اعلى قممه 1170 م فوق سطح البحر، ويعدّ احد مراكز المدينه السياحيه الهامه.\nتبلغ مساحه المدينه 105 كم2 بما فيها العمران المنتشر على جبل قاسيون، اما من دون احتساب العمران المنتشر على الجبل فتبلغ مساحتها 77 كم2.\n\nالاحياء والمناطق\nتعدّ المدينه القديمه اساس دمشق التاريخي، وهو ذات سور وعشره ابواب تاريخيه، وينصّفها الشارع الشارع المستقيم على نسق العماره الرومانيه، وتحوي عددًا من المعالم البارزه مثل القلعه، والجامع الاموي، وقصر العظم، وقصر الخضراء، وعدد من الاسواق التقليديه؛ والكثير من النمط العماري المعروف باسم البيوت العربيه، وتعدّ من اهم معالم سوريا السياحيه، وهي مدرجه على لائحه التراث العالمي منذ 1979. خارج المدينه القديمه، بدات الاحياء بالنشوء منذ القرن الثالث عشر مع ساروجه، والشاغور، والميدان، وتابعت نموّها حتى القسم الثاني من القرن العشرين، فزحف العمران نحو سفوح قاسيون وبساتين الغوطه؛ في المحصله فانّ بلدات مستقله عن دمشق باتت تعدّ جزءًا من المدينه، مثل برزه، وجوبر، والمزه، فضلاً عن الانشاءات السكنيه الحديثه مثل مشروع دمر، وكفر سوسه؛ في الاونه الراهنه تقسّم دمشق الى 15 منطقه، تقسم هذه الاحياء بدورها الى 95 حيًا، اما تاريخيًا فحتى بدايه القرن العشرين كان التقسيم التقليدي لدمشق، يجعلها في ثمانيه اثمان. بكل الاحوال، وبنتيجه توّسع المدينه، فهي ملتصقه بضواحيها، التي تتبع اداريًا محافظه ريف دمشق، بعض هذه التوسعات انشاءات حديثه مثل جرمانا واشرفيه صحنايا، والبعض الاخر بلدات تاريخيه مثل عربين، ودوما؛ يذكر ان عدد من اهالي دمشق انتقل من المدينه الى الضواحي، لكون تكلفه الحياه واسعار العقارات فيها اقل، ومن الشائع - كما في عدد كبير من مناطق العالم - ان يكون مكان استقرار الافراد في المدينه، بينما مركز عملهم في الضواحي، او العكس. وخلال الازمه السوريه افضت المعارك والقصف، الى دمار واسع في عدد كبير من هذه الضواحي، فضلاً عن هجره معظم سكانها لداخل مدينه دمشق او مناطق سوريه اخرى.\n\nالمناخ\nمناخ دمشق يتميز بكونه قاريًا جافًا الى شبه جاف، اذ ان قمم سلسله جبال لبنان الشرقيه تمنع تاثيرات البحر المتوسط من الوصول الى المدينه، وسوى ذلك فان انفتاحها من ناحيه الشرق والجنوب الشرقي على باديه الشام يجعلها عرضه لتاثيرات مناخيه من الباديه. اما درجات الحراره فيبلغ مدى تغيرها خلال العام 18 درجه مئويه، تتجاوز خلال فصل الصيف الاربعين وتنخفض في فصل الشتاء لحوالي سبع درجات، وفي بعض الاوقات لما دون الصفر ما يؤدي الى اصابه المزروعات بالصقيع فضلاً عن تساقط الثلوج. وعموما لا يتجاوز معدل الهطول المطري السنوي في دمشق بين 200 ملم، وهي غير منتظمه السقوط ما يجعل الاعتماد عليها في الزراعه امرًا صعبًا، غير ان الروافد المائيه وعلى راسها نهر بردى يغني عن ذلك. اما الرياح التي تهبّ على دمشق فلها نوعان الرياح الغربيه والجنوبيه الغربيه التي تكون محمله بدرجات عاليه من الرطوبه، والرياح الشرقيه القادمه من الباديه التي تهبّ عاده في فصل الصيف مسببه ارتفاعًا في درجات الحراره وعاده ما تكون محمله بالغبار.\n\nالسكان\nيَبلغ عدد سكان دمشق وريفها مُجتمعين وفقَ احصاء عام 2010 حوالي 4.4 ملايين نسمه، مُوزعين كـ1,724 الف نسمه في محافظه دمشق و2,701 الف نسمه في محافظه ريف دمشق، و50% من هؤلاء ذكور في دمشق فيما ان نسبتهم تصل الى حوالي 52% في ريفها، وبذلك يكون عدد سكان دمشق الكبرى اكبر تجمّع بشري في سوريا، ويقطنه حوالي 19.5% من الشعب، كما تعدّ المدينه بذلك اكبر مدن بلاد الشام، والرابعه في الوطن العربي. اما على صعيد مدينه دمشق الاداريه دون ضواحيها، فانها تحتل المرتبه الثانيه في سوريا بعد مدينه حلب، وبفارق ضئيل عن مدينه حمص، وهي المدن المليونيه الثلاث في سوريا.\nكان مجموع سكان المدينه وريفها قد بلغ حسب احصاء 2004 حوالي 4 ملايين نسمه، منهم 1.5 مليون في المدينه و2.5 في الريف. واما في احصاء 2007 فكان مجموع عدد السكان في المُحافظتين 4.15 ملايين نسمه، حيث احتلَّت ريف دمشق المرتبه الثانيه بعد حلب بـ2,487,000 نسمه تليها دمشق في المرتبه الثالثه بـ1,669,000 نسمه، واما حمص فكانت لا تزال في المرتبه الرَّابعه انذاك بفارق 22 الف نسمه عن دمشق. وفيما يخصُّ المستقبل يُتوقع ان يَصل عدد سكان دمشق وحدها بحلول عام 2025 الى اكثر من 5.6 ملايين نسمه، واما ريفها فسيَبلغ عدد سكانه 4.6 ملايين نسمه، لكن 80% من الزحف العمراني سيكون باتجاه الريف، وستزداد نسبه الاحياء العشوائيه في محيط المدينه. لا يُمكن الحصول على احصائيات دقيقه للتعداد التاريخي لسكان دمشق، وعُموماً يُوجد الكثير من التضارب في الاحصائيات المسجَّله. مع تحسُّن الامن والخدمات الصحيه وتوفر الغذاء في فتره النصف الثاني من القرن التاسع عشر والنصف الاول من القرن العشرين، بدا ازدياد مضطرب في نمو السكان بالنسبه الى المعدًّلات التاريخيه، حيث تضاعف المعدل مرَّات خلال العقود الاخيره. حسب اخر احصاء سكاني عام 2010، بلغ عدد سكان المدينه وريفها 4.4 ملايين نسمه.\n\nيَتالف التركيب العرقيُّ لسكان دمشق بشكل اساسي من عرب سوريا الذين يمثلون حوالي 95% من اجمالي السكان، ويَليهم الاكراد بنسبه 4%، وبالاضافه الى هؤلاء تُوجد اقليَّات اخرى من الارمن والسريان والتركمان والشركس والاذريين والبشناق والالبان وهم من وفدوا اليها خلال العهد العثماني، تمثل معاً الـ1% المتبقيه. الغالبيه العُظمى من السكان هي من المسلمين الذي يمثلون 93% من سكان المدينه، تاريخيًا من السُّنَّه، مع هجره حديثه للمدينه او ضواحيها من سائر الطوائف. بشكل مميز تعدّ ضاحيه الست زينب في الجنوب وحي شارع الامين ذات اقليه شيعيه اثني عشريه معتبره، وضاحيه حرستا (ضاحيه الاسد سابقًا) وعش الوروار في الشمال، ذات غالبيه علويه. يشكل المسيحيون حوالي 7% من سكان دمشق، وهم يتبعون اساسًا بطريركيه انطاكيه وسائر المشرق للروم الارثوذكس وبطريركيه الروم الكاثوليك. بقي في دمشق عدد ضئيل من اليهود، اذ انخفضت اعدادهم بشكل كبير خلال النصف الثاني من القرن العشرين.\nعدد الطلاب في دمشق وريفها كبير وهذا يجعل المدينه من «المدن الفتيّه». بلغ عدد المتقدمين في دمشق لامتحانات شهاده التعليم الاساسي والشهاده الثانويّه بمختلف فروعها 64,262 طالبا مقابل 42,994 طالبا في ريفها. تبلغ نسبه الاميّه في المدينه حسب احصاءات عام 2001 نحو 5.2% من السكان فقط وهي رابع محافظه سوريه من حيث القضاء على الاميه، رغم ذلك فان 33.3% من السكان اي ثلث دمشق حاصلون على التعليم الابتدائي فقط، وطبق الاحصاءات نفسها فان 6.6% من السكان فقط حاصلون على شهاده جامعيّه؛ علمًا بان دمشق تحقق افضل النتائج في البلاد من هذه الناحيه. اغلب الطبقات الاميّه والقليله التعليم هي متقدمه في العُمر بينما تنال اغلب الاجيال الجديده تعليمًا كاملاً، في حين تبلغ نسبه التسرّب الدراسي 7% من مجموع الطلاب فقط.\n\nالاداره\nحسب الماده الخامسه من دستور سوريا فان دمشق عاصمه البلاد، وهي بالتالي مقر الحكومه المركزيه والهيئات السياديه في الدوله، كالرئاسه، والحكومه، والبرلمان، وايضًا مقر البعثات الدبلوماسيه، واول قنصليه دبلوماسيه افتتحت في دمشق هي قنصليه الكرسي الرسولي عام 1762؛ وتقع غالب مقرات البعثات الاجنبيه في مناطق المالكي والمزّه. من ناحيه اداريه، فان دمشق هي محافظه سوريه، وهي اصغر المحافظات الاربع عشر من حيث المساحه، والوحيده التي فصل عنها الريف ومدن الضواحي، لتشكل محافظه اخرى هي محافظه ريف دمشق، ويقع مقرها في حرستا. طبقًا للقانون السوري، يعيّن رئيس الجمهوريه المحافظ ويعفيه من منصبه، في حين يقوم ناخبي المحافظه بانتخاب مجلس مدينه لمتابعه تنفيذ القضايا الاداريه اليوميه فيها. تقوم فروع دمشق من الهلال الاحمر السوري، والدفاع المدني السوري، والشرطه السوريه، بمهام الاسعاف، والاطفاء، والطوارئ، واداره المرور، وحفظ الامن الداخلي في المدينه؛ ويكون للضواحي فروعها الخاصه التابعه لمحافظه ريف دمشق. في مجلس الشعب السوري، تمثل دمشق منذ 1990 بعدد 29 نائبًا، وهو اعلى من حقها في التوزيع في حال توزيع النواب تناسبيًا لاعداد الناخبين بعشره مقاعد، كما تعدّ دائره انتخابيه واحده؛ تقليديًا فان دمشق تنتخب الحزب الوطني خلال مرحله الجمهوريه الاولى، عدا انتخابات 1961 حين حصل الاخوان المسلمون 4 مقاعد مقابل 3 للحزب الوطني ومستقلين لسائر المقاعد، وهي اخر انتخابات تعدديه جرت في سوريا، اما جميع الانتخابات اللاحقه خلال عهد الجمهوريه الثانيه كانت لمرشحي الجبهه الوطنيه التقدميه.\n\nالاقتصاد\nتقليديًا فان دمشق مدينه تجاريه، ورغم تغيّر طبيعه طرق التجاريه من القوافل التقليديه الى الوسائل الحديثه، فان دور المدينه كسوق استهلاكيه وانتاجيه هامه في سوريا، ومصدره لمنتجاتها للخارج لاسيّما دول مجلس التعاون لدول الخليج العربيه لم يتوقف. منذ 1954 يقام سنويًا معرض دمشق الدولي وقد شاركت به عام 2009 ثمانيه واربعين دوله، ويعدّ اقدم معرض يقام في الشرق الاوسط، الى جانب عدد من المعارض التخصصيه الاقل اهميه. وفي عام 2012 تم وضع اول ميزانيه ماليه لمحافظه دمشق، حيث وضعت ميزانيه قدرها 25 مليار ليره سوريه (حوالي نصف مليار دولار). خُصِّص 10% من الميزانيه للمشاريع الطارئه، وتركز الباقي على مشاريع التنميه والخدمات العامه، كشق الطرقات وبناء الجسور وحفر الانفاق. في عام 2009 افتتح سوق دمشق للاوراق الماليه، بوصفه الاول والوحيد في سوريا. كما تحتوي دمشق على عده نشاطات صناعيه، فالى جانب الصناعات التقليديه، مثل الحلويات الدمشقيه، والسيف الدمشقي، والتطعيم بالخزف، والمنسوجات اليدويه بانواعها، والتي تراجع دورها واهميتها في العصور الحديثه، فان ضواحي دمشق تحوي عددًا من المدن الصناعيه مثل مدينه حوش بلاس الصناعيه ومدينه عدرا، وتحوي مصانع عامّه وخاصه، بشكل خاص لصناعه المواد الغذائيه المعتمد على انتاج الغوطه الزراعي والحيواني، ومواد البناء، والملابس والمنسوجات، والعطور، وبعض الصناعات الثقيله. اما بالنسبه لسوق العقارات في دمشق فهو مزدهر، وحسب تقرير اعده مستشاري المؤسسه العقاريه كوشمان ويكفيلد اند، والذي افاد ان دمشق تعدّ ثامن اغلى مناطق العالم من حيث سعر المتر المربع في عام 2009.\n\nرغم ان قطاع السياحه قد دمّر بالكامل بنتيجه الازمه السوريه، فانّ دمشق تعدّ مدينه سياحيه بامتياز، ووضعت حسب بعض التصنيفات ضمن قائمه المواقع السياحيه الاكثر اهميه في العالم؛ وقد قدّر عدد السيّاح الاجانب في سوريا عام 2010 بنحو 6 ملايين سائح، لتحتل بذلك المرتبه الثالثه في النمو السياحي. نتيجه ذلك، فان دمشق تحوي جميع عناصر الصناعه السياحيه، كالفنادق، وبشكل خاص البيوت العربيه التقليديه التي تحولت الى فنادق في المدينه القديمه، والفنادق الحديثه مثل فندق الفورسيزون وفندق الشام، فضلاً عن المطاعم ومن اشهرها بوابه دمشق، وصالات الرقص والترفيه، والمكاتب السياحيه لتنظيم الرحلات الى المواقع المختلفه.\n\nخدمات\nالاعلام\nمنذ تاسيسهما اواسط القرن العشرين، فان دمشق مقر الاذاعه والتلفزيون السوري الرسمي، وكذلك الصحف الوطنيّه الثلاث صحيفه تشرين، وصحيفه الثوره، والبعث؛ خلال الفتره الممتده بين 1963 - 2004 كانت الدوله السوريه تحتكر وسائل الاعلام، خارج هذه الفتره وجدت ومنذ 1878 وجدت في دمشق منابر اعلاميه خاصه لاسيّما الصحف والمجلات، حاليًا يوجد اكثر من 60 صحيفه ومجله تصدر في دمشق. تعدّ دمشق ايضًا مقرًا للعديد من الاذاعات والتلفزات الخاصه، مع مكاتب اعلاميه دائمه لعدد من القنوات الاقليميه او الدوليه؛ فضلاً عن كونها مقر وكاله الانباء الرسميه سانا.\n\nالتعليم\nعام 2005 كانت دمشق تحوي 426 مدرسه حكوميّه ابتدائيّه و81 مدرسه حكوميّه ثانويّه و47 مدرسه حكوميّه مهنيّه، في حين يحوي ريفها 937 مدرسه ابتدائيّه و130 مدرسه ثانويه و81 مدرسه مهنيّه، كانت الدوله السوريّه ومنذ العام 1963 تحتكر القطاع التعليمي بكامل مفاصله، ففي عام 2004 سُمح لقطاع الخاص بالاستثمار في السلك التعليمي وشهدت العاصمه تاسيس عدد وافر من المدارس الخاصه الوطنيه امثال «واحه الشام» او فروع لمدارس في المنطقه العربيه امثال «مدرسه الشويفات»، على ان الطبقات الثريّه في المجتمع وحدها من تتجه نحو المدارس الخاصه بسبب اقساطها المرتفعه وغير المتلائمه مع متوسط دخل المواطن. في عام 1913، انشئت اول جامعه بالمفهوم المعاصر في دمشق وهي «مدرسه الحقوق» التي انشئت اواخر العهد العثماني، وشكلت نواه «الجامعه السوريّه» التي انشات في عهد صبحي بركات عام 1923، وحوّل اسمها لاحقًا الى جامعه دمشق، وهي مداره من قبل الحكومه السوريّه ويبلغ عدد الكليات التابعه لها 16 كليه و11 معهد عالي؛ ويبلغ عدد الطلاب فيها 115,256 طالب بموجب احصاءات العام 2007؛ الى جانب التعليم الحكومي الشبه مجاني بهذه الصيغه، هناك التعليم الموازي والتعليم المفتوح في جامعه دمشق؛ هناك ايضًا الجامعه الافتراضيه السوريه، والمعهد العالي لاداره الاعمال والمعهد العالي للعلوم التطبيقيه والتكنولوجيا، بعد السماح للقطاع الخاص الاستثمار في حقل التعليم العالي انتشرت في ضواحي دمشق عدد من الجامعات الخاصه امثال الجامعه السوريه الخاصه والجامعه العربيه الدوليه والجامعه الدوليه للعلوم والتكنولوجيا.\n\nالرياضه\nيتوفر في مدينه دمشق منشات رياضيه لعده رياضات شعبيه مثل كره القدم، وكره السله، والسباحه، والتنس، وتنس الطاوله والفروسيه والشطرنج. وقد برز الاهتمام بالمنشات الرياضيه في اعقاب استضافه المدينه لاحداث رياضيه هامه منها دوره الالعاب العربيه الخامسه والسابعه بين عامي 1976 و1992 على التوالي، ومهرجان الشباب العربي عام 1981، الى جانب العديد من الفعاليات الاخرى الاصغر حجمًا. كما تعدّ دمشق موطن لكثير من الانديه العريقه التي تنشط في الدوري الممتاز السوري لكره القدم، هي نادي الجيش، ونادي الوحده، ونادي المجد. تحوي دمشق مدينه الفيحاء الرياضيه التي تضم ملعبًا لكره القدم وصالات مغلقه لكره اليد والسله والطائره ونوادي ومنشات للجودو ورفع الاثقال والجمباز وملاعب تنس ومسابح. كما يوجد ايضًا ثلاث منشات رياضيه كبيره في المدينه هي ملاعب تشرين والجلاء والعباسيين، ويوجد ايضا ميدان للفروسيه واخر للرمايه في صحنايا على مقربه من دمشق.\n\nالصحه\nتحوي دمشق 43 مشفى خاص، وثلاثه مشافي كبيره تديرها الحكومه اهمها مشفى تشرين، ومشفى المواساه الجامعي؛ تدير الحكومه ايضًا عددًا من المراكز الصحيه موزعين على قطاعات دمشق الخمسه عشر، تقدم نحو 2.5 مليون خدمه طبيه سنويه حسب الارقام الرسميه. تقليديًا، فانّ البيمارستانات كانت مشافي دمشق التاريخيه، واهمها البيمارستان النوري.\n\nمعالم\nاسواق\nتحوي مدينه دمشق نمطًا تقليديًا من الاسواق المسقوفه، داخل الاسوار وخارجها، ابرز اسواق دمشق المسقوفه اربع: سوق الحميديه، وسوق مدحت باشا، والبزوريه، والحريقه، فضلاً عن وجود الاسواق التخصصيه مثل سوق الصاغه المتخصص ببيع المجوهرات والمصاغ؛ بشكل عام يمكن احصاء خمسين سوقًا تقليديًا متنوع الاستخدامات في مدينه دمشق؛ وتشكل فضلاً عن كونها ذات اهميه تراثيه واثريه كبيره، احد شرايين المدينه الاقتصاديه حتى وقتنا الراهن. ويلاحظ بشكل خاص في سوريا العثمانيه ازدهار «الخانات»، وهي بناء مربع من طابقين في وسطه ساحه مكشوفه يستخدم في الدور الاسفل كمستودع للبضائع والمعاملات التجاريه وفي الدور الاعلى كمنامه للتجار، على ان اغلب الخانات تحولت لمتاحف، وابرزها خان اسعد باشا. الاشكال الحديثه من الاسواق، يمكن تقسيمها الى فئتين: الشوارع التي تكثر فيها المحلات التجاريه مثل شارع الشعلان، وشارع الحمراء، ويعدّ البعض منطقه ابو رمانه بوصفها الوسط التجاري لدمشق الحديثه؛ والمراكز التجاريه الكبيره، وتحوي دمشق عددًا كبيرًا منها مثل: مالكي بلازا مول، شام سيتي سنتر، قاسيون مول، والاب تاون.\n\nحدائق واضرحه ونصب\nتقليديًا يعدّ جبل قاسيون الفسحه الرئيسيه لسكان دمشق، الى جانب الجبل فانّ مدينه دمشق تحوي 172 حديقه عامه تديرها محافظه دمشق، و790 حديقه خاصه ملحقه بالمنازل؛ تبلغ المساحه التقريبيه لحدائق دمشق 1.4 مليون كليومتر مربع، اهم حدائق دمشق العامه واكبرها حديقه تشرين، وحديقه السبكي، وحديقه التجاره. ابرز النصب العامه في مدينه دمشق، نصب الجندي المجهول في جبل قاسيون؛ ونصب ساحه المرجه التاريخي الذي اقيم لمناسبه ربط المدينه بالتغراف، ونصب السيف الدمشقي في ساحه الامويين، والذي غدا «رمزًا من رموز مدينه دمشق المعماريه»؛ ونصب صلاح الدين الايوبي مقابل سور القلعه؛ كما يترفع نصب يوسف العظمه في وسط ساحه المحافظه، شاهرًا سيفه.\nتحوي دمشق 33 مقبره عامه، ابرزها مقبره باب الصغير ومقبره الدحداح والتي تحوي قبورًا لشخصيات تاريخيه عديده؛ في المقبرتين المذكورتين تصل كلفه القبر لحوالي 500.000 ليره سوريه وغالبًا ما تتوارثه العائله؛ غلاء اسعار القبور في دمشق دفع شرائح من السكان لدفن موتاها في الضواحي، على سبيل المثال في حرستا لا تتجاوز تكلفه القبر 20.000 ليره سوريه. اما ابرز الاضرحه، فسوى ضريح يوحنا المعمدان - يحيى - في الجامع الاموي، وضريح الست زينب في الضاحيه المعروفه بالاسم في جنوب دمشق؛ فان دمشق تحوي اكثر من 65 ضريحًا الّفت حولها كتب مثل كتاب مشيدات دمشق ذوات الاضرحه؛ هذه الاضرحه تتنوع لشخصيات دينيه مثل ام سلمه وحفصه بنت عمر بن الخطاب من امهات المؤمنين، وصحابه مثل بلال الحبشي ودحيه الكلبي، وامراء مثل نور الدين زنكي، وصلاح الدين الايوبي، والظاهر بيبرس، وفلاسفه وعلماء مثل محي الدين بن عربي والفارابي، واخيرًا شخصيات سياسيه معاصره مثل شكري القوتلي.\n\nدور الثقافه\nتاسس المسرح في دمشق على يد ابو خليل القباني في القرن التاسع عشر، ويعدّ اول مسرح عربي حديث؛ في الايام الراهنه تحوي دمشق 25 مسرحًا تديرها وزاره الثقافه او الجهات الخاصه موزعه على 151 دار، ابرز مسارح دمشق دار اوبرا دمشق في ساحه الامويين. اول دور السينما في دمشق تاسس عام 1916 حاليًا تحوي دمشق 36 دار للسينما بعضها لا زال في الخدمه منذ تلك الفتره؛ وتحوي دمشق ايضًا تسعه متاحف سوريه، ابرزها المتحف الوطني الذي يحوي اثارًا من مختلف المحافظات السوريه، فضلاً عن متحف دمشق التاريخي المؤسس لتوثيق الحياه في مدينه دمشق عبر القرون، الى جانب المتاحف التخصصيه، مثل متحف الخط العربي، والمتحف الحربي السوري، وغيرهما من متاحف المدينه السبعه. على صعيد المكتبات العامه، فانّ المكتبه الظاهريه تعدّ من اكبر مكتبات الشرق من حيث المخطوطات القديمه والمؤلفات المحفوظه بها، والمكتبه الوطنيه السوريه التي افتتحت عام 1984 لتكون دارًا عامه للكتب في المدينه. الى جانب المراكز الثقافيه الوطنيه، تحوي دمشق عددًا من المراكز الثقافيه الاجنبيه الملحقه بالبعثات الدبلوماسيه، وتحوي الضواحي في مجمل محافظه ريف دمشق على 132 مركزًا ثقافيًا تابعًا لوزاره الثقافه.\n\nدور العباده\nتحوي دمشق على حوالي 200 مسجد، و36 كنيسه، و10 كنس يهوديه، لم يبق في الخدمه حاليًا منها سوى اثنان وبشكل غير متصل.\nويعدّ الجامع الاموي، اشهر مساجد دمشق، ومعالمها الدينيه اجمالاً، واعتبره البعض رابع المساجد شهره في الاسلام، تاركًا اثاره المعماريه على عدد من الابنيه الاخرى داخل وخارج سوريا. كما مساجد بارزه اخرى ذات انماط ايوبيه - مملوكيه، او عثمانيه نذكر منها على المثال التكيه السليمانيه، وهناك ايضًا المساجد الحديثه؛ ويمكن تصنيف مساجد دمشق بثلاث تصنيفات المساجد باصلها، والمساجد التي انشات كمدارس، والمساجد التي انشات كاضرحه. وتعدّ المدينه مقرًا دائمًا لثلاثه صروح بطريركيه انطاكيه ابرزها الكنيسه المريميه، وكنيسه الزيتون، وتوجد الى جانب هذه الكنائس الاثريه كنائس حديثه النمط المعماري مثل كنيسه الصليب في القصاع. الى جانب دور العباده، فان الجهات المديره لهذه الاماكن، تدير عددًا من المؤسسات المتصله بها مثل مجمع الدراسات الاسلاميه.\n\nنمط العماره\nالاسلوب المعماري التقليدي في دمشق، هو ما يعرف في سوريا باسم البيت العربي وهو الاساس المعماري في المدينه القديمه، التي تتميز بالشوارع المرصوفه بالحجاره، والازقه الضيقه، والاسراف في الزخرفه والتطعيم. منذ اواخر القرن التاسع عشر وبدايه القرن العشرين، تطور اسلوب العماره في دمشق، وانفتح على اساليب متعدده فرضتها تدخلات المعماريين الاجانب في عماره بعض المنشات العامه ثم تسربت اتجاهات العماره الاوروبيه الشائعه بواسطه المعماريين المحليين الذين درسوا في الغرب؛ وفي عام 1936 وضع اول مخطط تنظيمي شامل لمدينه دمشق على يد المعماري الفرنسي دانجييه عام 1936، والذي اهتم بصوره خاصه بتخطيط الشوارع الرئيسيه وانشاء الساحات الكبيره الدائريّه، وفي عام 1963 قام المعماري الفرنسي ميشيل ايكوشار بتخطيط عمراني جديد لدمشق ساهم في توسعها نحو الجبال والشمال بشكل كبير، وقد صدرت عده مخططات تنظيميه اخرى كان اخرها عام 2010، ركز هذا التخطيط الاخير على الضواحي والتوسعات.\nويمكن ملاحظه انواع معماريه مختلفه في المدينه، مكتب عنبر على سبيل المثال يتبع نمط المحلي مضافًا اليه العماره الباروكيه، بينما محطه حديد الحجاز تتبع النمط الكلاسيكي الجديد مع طغيان العناصر المحليه في الزخرفه والتطعيم وجميع التفاصيل البناء الداخليه، وكذلك حال مبنى البرلمان، اما حي الصالحيه يغلب عليه الطراز المتوسطي مثل مدرسه الفيحاء، في حين ان الطراز الكولونيالي يمكن ان تصنف ضمنه عده ابنيه منها مبنى العابد. الطراز الاوروبي التقليدي الذي ساد في القرن التاسع عشر وبدايات القرن العشرين، يصنّف ضمنه عدد كبير من ابنيه دمشق التي بنيت في تلك الفتره، ابرزها فندق الشرق؛ ويعود للطراز المعماري الحديث كل من مبنى المكتبه الوطنيه السوريه، ومبنى دار اوبرا دمشق، والبنك المركزي.\n\nطرق النقل والساحات\nتنظم حركه النقل والمواصلات في دمشق، عدد من المحاور والطرق السريعه والعاديه، المزوده بالجسور والانفاق، ابرزها المتحلق الجنوبي، الذي يمرّ فوق مدينه دمشق رابطًا اياها بالريف، ومنتهيًا في شارع شكري القوتلي وسط المدينه؛ ويمتدّ المتحلق الشمالي بطول 37 كم، الذي يتصل مع الضواحي في الهامه مارًا فوق وادي بردى، وينتهي في حي الميدان. كذلك فان ساحه الامويين، وساحه العباسيين، تعدّان ابرز ساحتين في قلب المدينه واكبرهما، وتقوم عقده قصر الشعب وجسر المهاجرين المقام الاساسي في عقد المواصلات للقسم الغربي من المدينه، وعقده القابون اساس قسمها الشرقي؛ وتقليديًا في ساحه المرجه تعدّ ساحه وسط مدينه دمشق. اما الطرق السريعه لخارج دمشق الكبرى، فاقدمها واهمها طريق بيروت الشام، الذي يصلّ دمشق ايضًا بالمناطق الغربيه من ريفها كالزبداني؛ والطريق الثاني هو طريق الاردن، الذي يربط دمشق بالمحافظات الجنوبيه حتى عمان، والطريق الثالث شمالاً نحو حمص وحلب؛ وهناك ايضًا طريق تدمر وطريق المطار، بالاتجاه الشرقي من دمشق.\n\nبين 1903 - 1962 كان ترام دمشق يستخدم داخل المدينه؛ اما سكك الحديد في دمشق بدات عام 1895 بربط دمشق ببيروت، عبر عده محطات على الطريق، وانشا عام 1900 الخط الحديدي الحجازي لربط المدينه بجنوبها حتى المدينه المنوره، وبشمالها حتى حلب واسطنبول، الا انه متوقف منذ الحرب العالميه الاولى، ومستبدل باخر محلي يربط دمشق بحمص ومنها الى سائر المحافظات الشماليه والغربيه؛ كشفت الحكومه السوريّه مؤخرًا عن مشروع ربط المدن القريبه في ريف دمشق بالمدينه عن طريق سكك الحديد ايضًا، في حين تنفذ حاليًا مشروعًا لربط المدينه بسكك الحديد مع درعا والقنيطره. وفي عام 2008، اعلنت الحكومه عن خطه لبناء مترو دمشق مع وقت افتتاح الخط الاخضر، ومن المقرر افتتاح المرحله الاولى منه عام 2015، والمرحله الرابعه والاخيره عام 2050. اما المطار الرئيسي منذ 1975 هو مطار دمشق الدولي، على بعد 20 كيلومتر من مركز المدينه، وولجه 5.5 مليون مسافر خلال عام 2010 بزياده تقدر 50% عما كان عليه عدد الوالجين خلال عام 2004؛ قبل مطار دمشق كان مطار المزه يعدّ بوابه دمشق الجويّه، وحوّل للاستعمال العسكري بعد افتتاح مطار دمشق.\nالنقل العام يتم من خلال سيارات الاجره او الحافلات الصغيره التي تربط ضواحي المدينه بعضها ببعض، ويبلغ عدد مجمل الخطوط 100 خط يصل بعضها الى قلب المدينه، وبعضها الاخر الى الضواحي، مع تفوق لسيارات الاجره. تواجه دمشق في السنوات الاخيره ازمه مروريه متزايده، حيث تسجَّل فيها 250 سياره جديده كل يوم، وهناك 40 عقده مروريه بها بحاجه الى حل، ويقدر اجمالي النقص في الحافلات العامه بمقدار 1,800 الى 2,200 حافله للنقل العام لتلبيه احتياجات المدينه، فضلاً عن غياب المرائب التارضيّه. وتعدّ سرعه السيارات في دمشق، مراقبه عبر هيئه مرور دمشق، التي وزعت ضوابط للعدادات وكاميرات مراقبه في شوارع المدينه.\n\nالثقافه\nثقافه اهل دمشق تعدّ جزءًا من الثقافه السوريه بشكل عام، مؤثره ومتاثره بها، فبينما تعدّ دمشق اصل العراضه الشاميه، ورقصه السيف والترس التي انتقلت الى المدن الاخرى، فانّ الانماط التقليديه للغناء، واغاني دمشق التراثيه التي يعود تاليف اشهرها لابي خليل القباني، وفدت من ناحيه النمط والاسلوب من حلب. من عادات دمشق شبه المندثره، اقامه الاحتفالات الخاصه لمناسبات الولاده، او الختان، ويتم تقليديًا في عمر سبع سنوات؛ والاحتفالات التي تقام في الحمامات العامه، وحضور الحكواتي والكركوزاتي او مسرح خيال الظل؛ وقد فصّل عدد كبير من المؤرخين انواع الاحتفالات التي تقام في دمشق، ومجالس اللهو والطرب التقليديه منها الاصفهاني في كتاب الاغاني، من ناحيه المطبخ السوري في دمشق، فللمدينه بعض اصناف من الاطباق تختصّ بها وحدها مثل حراء باصبعو، كما تعدّ السيارين او السياحه في بساتين الغوطه او جبل قاسيون، احد عناصر ثقافه دمشق، والتي حسب ما ذكره المؤرخون، ذات اصول معينه، ففي سبع سبوت في العام تتم في الغوطه، وفي خمسه اخمسه في العام تتم في قاسيون، الى جانب الاحتفال ببدا فصل الربيع او النوروز من عموم اهل دمشق. اللهجه السوريه السائده في دمشق ذات الف مثقله اكثر من باقي المدن والمناطق وهو ما يميّزها؛ في الدراما السوريه، ومع مسلسل ايام شاميه عام 1992 برز نمط جديد يعرف باسم مسلسلات البيئه الشاميه، والذي يوّثق الحياه اليوميه لاهل دمشق من مختلف الصعد والجوانب في مرحله سوريا العثمانيه، او بدايات الانتداب الفرنسي، يذكر انّ مسلسل باب الحاره حقق في جزءه الثاني جماهيريه شعبيّه في الوطن العربي دفعت صحيفه الواشنطن بوست لاعتباره احد الاعمال التلفزيونيه العشره الاكثر متابعه حول العالم. رغم ذلك، فانّ هذه الطائفه من الدراما استقطبت انتقادات واسعه وذهب عدد متزايد من النقاد لاعتبارها لا تنقل واقع دمشق شكل امين بل بشكل مشوّه. وقد انشات القريه الشاميه، كمنطقه تحاكي دمشق في تلك المرحله. في عام 2008 تم اختيار دمشق عاصمه للثقافه العربيه، واقيمت العديد من الفعاليات والنشاطات ضمن الاحتفالات، وصدرت العديد من الاعمال التوثيقيه حول دمشق للمناسبه.\n\nفي الشعر والادب\nمن شعرها في وصف دمشقعائشه الباعونيه[من ]\n\nعبر التاريخ، وصفت دمشق ومدحت في العديد من الاداب العالميه من قبل الرحاله، والشعراء، والروائيين، بعضهم اجانب مثل الرحاله الفرنسي لامارتين، والبعض الاخر عرب. مدح دمشق في الادب العربي يعود لما قبل الاسلام حتى، وقد مدح حسان بن ثابت دمشق ببضع ابيات؛ اما ابرز من مدح دمشق في الادب القديم، فيذكر البحتري، وابي تمام في الشعر، وابن جبير والمقدسي في ادب الرحلات، كما وضعت مؤلفات مستقله في وصف دمشق مثل كتاب «النجوم الزاهره في اخبار دمشق والقاهره»، وكتاب «نزهه الانام في محاسن الشام» للبدري. حديثًا، ومنذ النهضه العربيه في القرن التاسع عشر، فان معظم شعراء العرب البارزين، من سوريين وغير سوريين، قد كتبوا عن دمشق، منهم احمد شوقي، محمود درويش، سعيد عقل، عمر ابو ريشه، نزار قباني، بشاره الخوري وسواهم. هذه الاعمال جمعت في ديوان دمشق الذي اطلق لمناسبه احتفاليه دمشق عاصمه الثقافه العربيه؛ والبعض منها، تحولت الى اغاني مثل قصيدتي شام يا ذا السيف وقرات مجدك لسعيد عقل وقد غنتهما فيروز، والقصيده الدمشقيه لنزار قباني وقد غنتها اصاله نصري.\n\nمدن شقيقه\nالمدن الشقيقه لدمشق هي:\n\nمعرض الصور\nانظر ايضًا\nالجدول الزمني لتاريخ دمشق.\n\nالمراجع\nكتب\nمواقع خارجيه\n\nموقع محافظه

      "summary": "دِمَشْق هي عاصمة الجمهورية العربية السورية، ومركز محافظة دمشق. وهي إحدى أقدم مدن العالم مع تاريخ غير منقطع منذ أحد عشر ألف عام تقريبًا، وأقدم مدينة - عاصمة في العالم. أصبحت عاصمة منطقة سوريا منذ عام 635.\nهناك عدة نظريات في شرح معنى اسم دمشق، أوفرها انتشارًا كون اللفظة سامية قديمة بمعنى الأرض المسقية؛ يعود ذلك لموقع المدينة الجغرافي في سهل خصيب يرويه نهر بردى وفروعه العديدة، مشكلاً بذلك غوطة دمشق؛ وأيضًا يتميز موقع المدينة بوجود جبل قاسيون فيها. اقتصرت تسمية دمشق على المدينة القديمة حتى القرون الوسطى، حين أخذت المدينة بالتوسّع خارجها، حاليًا تتألف دمشق من خمسة عشر منطقة سكنية متصلة بمحيطها من الضواحي لتشكل ما يعرف باسم دمشق الكبرى.\nالمدينة تعدّ المركز الإداري لمحافظة دمشق، بينما تتبع معظم الضواحي إداريًا لمحافظة ريف دمشق. حسب إحصاءات عام 2013 فإن عدد سكان دمشق بلغ 1.9 مليون نسمة، لتكون بذلك ثاني أكبر المدن السورية بعد حلب، بينما يبلغ عدد سكان دمشق الكبرى (حسب إحصاء 2010) 4.4 مليون نسمة، لتكون بذلك أكبر تجمع سكاني في سوريا، وبر الشام، وضمن أكبر عشر مدن في الوطن العربي بعد القاهرة، وبغداد والرياض؛ وتبلغ مساحة المدينة 105 كم2؛ غالبية سكان دمشق التقليدية هم من عرب سوريا على صعيد العرق، ومن المسلمين السنة على صعيد الدين. عبر التاريخ، سكنت دمشق جماعات صغيرة العدد، من أصول أوروبية - بلقانية بشكل أساسي - وعربية، بدواع مختلفة، انسجم أغلبها بمرور الوقت مع نسيج المدينة؛ تحوي دمشق أيضًا أعدادًا كبيرة من المواطنين المنحدرين من سائر المدن والمحافظات السورية، كمقيمين دائمين فيها. بوصفها العاصمة، فإن دمشق مقر جميع الوزرات والمقرات الهامة في الدولة السورية، بما فيها البرلمان، والمحكمة الدستورية العليا.\nمنذ العصور القديمة، اشتهرت دمشق بوصفها مدينة تجارية، تقصدها القوافل للراحة أو التبضع، كانت المدينة إحدى محطات طريق الحرير، وطريق البحر، وموكب الحج الشامي، والقوافل المتجهة إلى فارس أو آسيا الصغرى أو مصر أو الجزيرة العربية. هذا الدور الاقتصادي البارز لعب دورًا في إغناء المدينة وتحويلها إلى مقصد ثقافي وسياسي أيضًا، فالمدينة كانت خلال تاريخها مركزًا لعدد من الدول أهمها الدولة الأموية - أكبر دولة إسلامية من حيث المساحة في التاريخ، وفيها أقامت ودفنت شخصيات بارزة في تاريخ الشرق مثل صلاح الدين الأيوبي والظاهر بيبرس. أما حاليًا، فيقوم اقتصاد دمشق على التجارة، والصناعة المنتشرة في الضواحي، والسياحة، وقد اعتبرت دمشق عام 2010 واحدة من أفضل المقاصد السياحية في العالم، إلا أنّ الأزمة السورية المندلعة منذ 2011، أفضت إلى تراجع كبير في اقتصاد المدينة، وبروز أزمات اجتماعية واقتصادية فيها. اعتبارًا من سبتمبر 2019،\nأي بعد مرور ما يُقارب ثماني سنوات على الحرب الأهلية، تم تصنيف دمشق على أنها المدينة الأقل ملاءمةً للعيش في العالم، من قبل وحدة الاستخبارات الاقتصادية. صنفت دمشق في عام 2022 أسوأ مدينة في العالم من حيث العيش.\nتُعرف أيضًا بأسماء عديدة منها الشام و مدينة الياسمين؛ وقد احتلت مكانة إقليمية بارزة على صعيد الفنون، والآداب، والسياسة؛ وحظيت باهتمام الأدباء والشعراء والرحالة ونظم في وصفها العديد من النصوص الشعريّة والأدبيّة، نذكر منهم ياقوت الحموي الذي كتب:\n\nويقول نزار قباني:",
