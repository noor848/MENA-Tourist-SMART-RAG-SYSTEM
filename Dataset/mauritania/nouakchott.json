      "content": "Nouakchott ( nwa(h)k-SHOT) is the capital and largest city of Mauritania. Located in the southwestern part of the country, it is one of the largest cities in the Sahara. The city also serves as the administrative and economic center of Mauritania.\nOnce a mid-sized coastal village, Nouakchott was selected as the capital for the nascent nation of Mauritania, with construction beginning in 1958. It was originally designed to accommodate a population of 15,000, but experienced significant population growth in the 1970s when many Mauritanians fled their home villages due to drought and increasing desertification. Many of the newcomers settled in slum areas of the city that were poorly maintained and extremely overcrowded. By the mid-1980s, Nouakchott's population was estimated to be between 400,000 and 500,000.\nAs of 2023, the city had a population of nearly 1.5 million people and serves as the hub of the Mauritanian economy. It is home to a deepwater port and Nouakchott–Oumtounsy International Airport, one of the country's two international airports. It also hosts the University of Nouakchott and several other more specialized institutions of higher learning.\n\nHistory\nNot too long ago, Nouakchott was a small fishing town, having been a fortified fishing village (ksar) in pre-colonial times and under French rule. As Mauritania prepared for independence, it lacked a capital city. The area of present-day Nouakchott was chosen by Moktar Ould Daddah, the first President of Mauritania, and his advisors. Ould Daddah desired the new capital to symbolize modernity and national unity, which ruled out existing cities or towns in the interior. The village was selected as the capital city for its central location between Saint-Louis, Senegal, the city from which the colony of Mauritania was governed, and Nouadhibou. The village of Nouakchott was originally inhabited by the tribe of Bouhoubainy who are of Amazigh origin and are native to it. They have since been moved to different settlements notably Aknodert which is situated between Nouakchott and the International Airport. One of the intentions of choosing this location was to avoid the sensitive issue of whether the capital was built in an area dominated by the Arabs and Amazigh (Berbers) or Sub-Saharan Africans.\nConstruction began in March 1958 to enlarge the village to house a population of 15,000, in 1959 Nouakchott started with its founding by indigenous people from the surrounding region, and the basics were completed by the time that the French granted independence on 28 November 1960. Nouakchott was planned with the expectation that commerce and other economic activities would not take place in the city. Nouakchott's central business district was planned with broad streets and a grid-like structure; the new Cinquième Quartier (Fifth District) was located close to this area and became the location of a large open-air market and residential area within a few years. During the 1960s, the city obtained its own local government. By the 1970s, these new areas had grown so much that they replaced the old ksar in terms of importance, as they also hosted the governmental buildings and state enterprises.\nThe city was attacked twice in 1976 by the Polisario Front during the Western Sahara conflict, but the guerrillas caused little damage. The city has had massive and unconstrained growth, driven by the North African drought, since the beginning of the 1970s; hundreds of thousands moved there in search of a better life. The official censuses showed 134,000 residents in 1977 and 393,325 in 1988, although both figures were probably smaller than reality. The population is now estimated to consist of at least one third of the country's population of 3.3 million, and the 2013 census showed a population of 958,399.\n\nGeography\nLocated on the Atlantic coast of the Sahara Desert, it lies on the west coast of Africa. With the exception of Friendship Port and a small fishing port, the coastal strip is mostly left empty and allowed to flood. The coastline includes shifting sandbanks and sandy beaches. There are areas of quicksand close to the harbor. Nouakchott is largely flat, and some of the city lies below sea level. It is threatened by the sand dunes advancing from its eastern side which pose a daily problem. There have been efforts to save particular areas, including work by Jean Meunier. Owing to the rapid build-up, the city is quite spread out, with few tall buildings. Most buildings are one-story.\nNouakchott is built around a large tree-lined street, Avenue Gamal Abdel Nasser, which runs northeast through the city centre from the airport. It divides the city into two, with the residential areas in the north and the medina quarter, along with the kebbe, a shanty town formed due to the displacement of people from other areas by the desert. Other major streets are named (in French) for notable Mauritanian or international figures of the 1960s: Avenue Gamal Abdel Nasser, Avenue Charles de Gaulle, Avenue Kennedy, and Avenue Lumumba, for example.\nThe kebbe consists of cement buildings that are built overnight and made to look permanent to avoid destruction by the authorities. In 1999, it was estimated that more than half of the city's inhabitants lived in tents and shacks, which were used for residential as well as business purposes. The city is broken into nine arrondissements, sub-divided into alphabetized Îlots. These are Teyarett, Ksar, Tevragh-Zeïna, Toujounine, Sebkha, El Mina, Dar-Naïm, Arafat and Riad. The Sebkha (Cinquième) Arrondissement is home to a large shopping area.\n\nClimate\nNouakchott features a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh) with hot temperatures throughout the year but cool winter night temperatures. Due to the city's oceanside location, Nouakchott is generally not quite as hot as other cities with the same climate. Still, the city can experience sweltering days. While average high temperatures are relatively constant at around 33 °C (91 °F), average low temperatures can range from 25 °C (77 °F) during the fall months (in this city fall is hotter than summer, with September and October being the hottest months) to 13 °C (55 °F) during the winter months. Minimum temperatures can be as low as 10 °C (50 °F) during winter nights in Nouakchott. Average rainfall in the city is 95 mm (3.7 in) a year.\n\nClimate change\nA 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a \"moderate\" scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~2.5–3 °C (4.5–5.4 °F) by 2100, the climate of Nouakchott in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Khartoum. The annual temperature would increase by 2.3 °C (4.1 °F), and the temperature of the warmest month by 2.8 °C (5.0 °F), while the temperature of the coldest month would decrease by 0.3 °C (0.54 °F). According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with 2.7 °C (4.9 °F), which closely matches RCP 4.5.\n\nSustainability\nResponding to a 450% projected increase in electricity demand between 2010 and 2030, Nouakchott's Sheikh Zayed solar power plant was completed in 2012 and is considered the largest solar power plant in Africa. The desert climate causes dust accumulation, which negatively impacts the performance of photovoltaic solar panels.\n\nGovernment\nNouakchott is divided into three administrative regions (wilayat) led by governors appointed by the central government, each of which contains three departments (moughataa):\n\nNouakchott-Nord (Nouakchott-North): Dar-Naim, Teyarett, Toujouonine\nNouakchott-Ouest (Nouakchott-West): Ksar, Sebkha, Tevragh-Zeina\nNouakchott-Sud (Nouakchott-South): Arafat, El Mina, Riyad\nSeparate from the wilayat, a directly elected regional council was established in Nouakchott in 2018, which took over the roles of promoting social and economic development from the Urban Community that it replaced. Fatimatou Abdel Malick was elected Council president in September 2018, and re-elected in May 2023.\nNouakchott was initially divided into four departments in 1973. In 1986 the current nine departments were created.\nFormerly a district, in 1990 Nouakchott became a region of Mauritania. On 25 November 2014, it was split into the three current regions, with the previous governor of Nouakchott Mahi Ould Hamed becoming the first governor of Nouakchott-Nord.\n\nDemographics\nFor comparison, its population was only 20,000 in 1969. Part of the difficulty in estimating the city's population is that part of it is nomadic, setting up tents in suitable locations, then packing up when the need strikes. Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million. The 2013 census gave the city's population as 958,399.\n\nSlum resettlement\nIn 2009, the government of Mauritania announced that it would begin a process of clearing the slum on the outskirts of Nouakchott, as 24,000 families would eventually be relocated to planned housing in the city. The process was scheduled to begin with the relocation of 9,000 families from the outskirts into the poor Arafat department neighborhood of \"Kosovo\", popularly named for its high crime rate and poor services. The government planned to begin moving families in June 2009, despite concerns from aid agencies that needed infrastructure could not be put in place in the receiving neighborhood.\nIn 2013, it was reported that \"slums have been replaced by social dwellings for the poorest\" The World Bank reported that the plan met with substantial success; it resulted in access to improved services for 181,035 people in the slum areas. Now in 2023 the population is approximately 1.5M people.\n\nEconomy\nNouakchott is the center of the Mauritanian economy, with three-quarters of service sector enterprises located in the city as of 1999 with 90% of the city's economic activity consisting of informal transactions. The Capital downtown area is home to the headquarters of multiple major national banks and companies and the site of a cluster of open-air markets.\nThe city is the focus of many modernization and foreign investment projects, with two five-star hotels finishing construction in 2024.\n\nTransport\nNouakchott has a Chinese-built deepwater port that opened in 1986. It was designed for a capacity of 500,000 tons deadweight (DWT) of cargo a year, but has been handling 1,500,000 tons (DWT) by 2009. China agreed in 2009 to invest US$282 million in the port, aiming to extend the main quay by over 900 m (3,000 ft). As of 2011, the World Bank was investigating funding a new shipping container facility at the port.\nAir service is provided by Nouakchott–Oumtounsy International Airport, which replaced the previous Nouakchott International Airport in June 2016.\nThe Cairo–Dakar Highway leg from Nouakchott to Nouadhibou was paved in 2004, although the Nouakchott-Rosso leg was paved before independence. A 1,100-kilometre (680 mi) road (Route de l'Espoir (Road of Hope)) connects the city with Néma via Boutilimit and Kiffa. In the city, there is a public transport and commuter system, with vehicles serving major boulevards.\nIn July 2022, a tramway project was presented; it does not have a scheduled opening date.\n\nEducation\nThe city is home to the University of Nouakchott Al Aasriya, the main university in Mauritania, opened in 1981. As of 1995, it had 70 professors and 2,800 students. Other higher education facilities include the Lebanese International University of Mauritania, the National School of Administration, the College of Science and Technology and the Higher Scientific Institute.\nPublic schools in Nouakchott are dispersed throughout the city, while private schools are concentrated in middle and upper-class districts. Among the most prominent international schools for citizens and expats alike are the American International School of Nouakchott, the Lycée Français Théodore Monod, and TLC International School.\n\nCulture\nAttractions in Nouakchott include the National Museum of Mauritania, the National Library, the Port de Pêche, and the National Archives. The city hosts several markets, including the Marocaine market and the beaches. One beach is devoted to fishing boats where fish can be bought fresh at the Fish market. Nouakchott is a principal selling place of native Saharan meteorites.\n\nPlaces of worship\nNouakchott, like the rest of the country, is populated by a Sunni Muslim super-majority, and mosques are extremely common in neighborhoods. The Saudi Mosque and Masjid Ibn Abbas are the most notable, due to their grand architecture and size.\nThere are also few Christian churches and temples: the most well-known is the Cathedral of Saint Joseph in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nouakchott (Catholic Church).\n\nSport\nNouakchott hosts ten of the fourteen teams of the Mauritanian Super D1 as of the 2023–2024 season, including ACS Ksar, AS Douanes, AS Garde Nationale, ASAC Concorde, ASC Police, ASC Tidjikja, FC Gourel Sangue, FC Tevragh-Zeina, Kaedi FC, and Nouakchott Kings.\n\nTwin towns – Sister cities\nNouakchott is twinned with: \n\n Al-Quds, Palestine (2012)\n Amman, Jordan (1999)\n Lanzhou, China (2000)\n Madrid, Spain (1986)\n Oujda, Morocco\n\nSee also\nList of cities in Mauritania\nEconomy of Mauritania\nTransport in Mauritania\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nArmelle Choplin et Riccardo Ciavolella, 2008. \" Marges de la ville en marge du politique ?

      "content": "نُوَاكْشُوط او انواكشوط هي عاصمه موريتانيا واكبر مدنها، قدر عدد سكانها عام 2013 بـ 958 الف نسمه. في عام 1957 اختيرت منطقه نواكشوط الساحليه لتصبح العاصمه للدوله الجديده. تعد واحده من اكبر المدن في الصحراء الكبرى، والمركز الاداري والاقتصادي في موريتانيا. وتقع على خطي 18°و 6' شمال، 15° و 57' غرب. وضع المختار ولد داداه (اول رئيس لموريتانيا) والرئيس الفرنسي حينها شارل ديغول الحجر الاساس للعاصمه في 5 مارس 1958 لتتحول نواكشوط سريعًا من قريه صغيره (200-300 نسمه) وسط صحراء موحشه تفتقر لمياه جوفيه صالحه للشرب، وتعاني نقصًا حادًا في مياه الامطار، الى اهم مدينه في موريتانيا، وكان ذلك قبيل استقلال البلاد بثلاث سنوات لكي تكون عاصمه الدوله الناشئه.\n\nالتاريخ\nتعود اول اثار السكن البشري بالمنطقه الى العصر الحجري. وقد استقرت بها قبائل من السود قادمه من الجنوب ومن الشرق وتشكلت اول تجمعات سكانيه في موريتانيا على سواحل الاطلسي في قرى تسمى قرى «ايمراغن» كانت نواكشوط احداها حسب راي بعض الباحثين، في حين يرى اخرون ان الامازيغ كانوا الاسبق في المنطقه.\n\nالتاريخ القديم\nفي الالفيه الاولى قبل الميلاد هاجرت قبائل بربريه قادمه من شمال افريقيا الى المنطقه وهيمنت على السكان السود. وجلبت هذه القبائل معها الجياد والجمال التي سهلت التبادل التجاري. ثم في الالفيه الاولى بعد الميلاد حل بربر صنهاجه بالمنطقه المطله على المحيط وسيطروا على الطرق التجاريه الصحراويه.\n\nدخول الاسلام\nفي بدايه من القرن الثالث عشر اجتاحت قبائل عربيه البلاد. ثم في القرن السادس عشر استقرت قبائل بني حسان العربيه بموريتانيا وقد جاءت من مصر العليا لكنها واجهت معارضه شديده من القبائل البربريه التي تمت السيطره عليها في النهايه. في القرن الحادي عشر، كان دخول الاسلام موريتانيا ما يعرف سابقاً ببلاد شنقيط جزءا مغموراً من الدوله الاسلاميه مُنذ العهد الاموي، ولم يعتنِ به المؤرخون كثيرا، ولعل السبب هو البعد وضعف عنايه اهل البلد بالكتابه عن انفسهم، مع ان الاسلام وصل الى تلك البلاد في اواخر القرن الاول الهجري، ويحدد بعضهم ذلك التاريخ بسنه 63 هـ، وقيل كان في بدايه القرن الثاني على راي من يحدده بسنه 112 هـ، فيقول ابن خلدون: في كتابه العبر متحدثاً عن القائد عقبه بن نافع وفتوحاته: «ودخل المغرب الاقصى واثخن في المصادمه ودوخ بلادهم حتى حملهم على الاسلام ثم جاز الى السوس لقتال من بها من صنهاجه اهل اللثام فاثخن فيهم وقاتل مسوفه وراء السوس وقفل راجعا» ، والسوس مكان معروف يقع وراء: تارودانت ويصب في المحيط الاطلسي من بلاد موريتانيا حاليًا.\nوقيل ان عقبه هو الذي وقف على شاطئ المحيط الاطلسي وادخل جواده حتى بلغ الماء نحره ثم قال: «اللهم اني اشهدك ان لا مجاز ولو وجدت مجازا لاجزت»، وظل اهل تلك البلاد من ذلك التاريخ مسلمين، وان مرت بهم فترات يحملون فيها الاسلام بضعف، وكانت اول دوله اسلاميه قامت على جزء من هذه الارض هي دوله غانا (في القرن الرابع الهجري) التي كانت عاصمتها كومبي صالح في شرق موريتانيا حالياً، وكان للمسلمين العرب صله بها، يقول محمود شاكر: «ويبدو ان احد الاشراف قد وصل الى امبراطوريه غانا، واسس مدينه كومي صالح التي اصبحت عاصمه تلك الامبراطوريه … وكانت قد توسعت هذه الامبراطوريه حتى شملت اراضي موريتانيا اليوم» ، ثم دوله مالي التي قامت سنه 638 والتي شملت الاجزاء الشرقيه من موريتانيا الحاليه.\nوفي عام 427 هـ خرج «يحيى بن ابراهيم الكدالي» حاجا في طائفه من قومه وفي طريق عودته مر على القيروان فالتقى بشيخ المالكيه بها ابو عمران الفاسي وبعد مناقشه بينهما قال له الشيخ: «ما يمنعكم من تعلم الشرع على وجهه والامر بالمعروف والنهي عن المنكر؟» فقال له: «لا يصل الينا الا معلمون لا ورع لهم ولا علم بالسنه عندهم» وطلب يحي من الفقيه ان يرسل معه مستشارا ومعلما من خيره تلاميذته فكلف بذلك «وجاج بن زلوم اللمطي» الذي وقع اختياره على عبد الله بن ياسين الجزولي وكان حازما وعالما بالسياسه.\n\nقيام الدوله الاسلاميه\nبعد عوده يحيى ومعه عبد الله بن ياسين دخل البلاد فتره انتشار الاسلام، فبدات بالتعليم والدعوه فوجد الرجلان بدايه نفره وصعوبه في ذلك فاتخذا معسكرا اطلق عليه اسم «الرباط» وسمي كذلك لما فيه من مرابطه على العباده والتدريب، وكان في جزيره على البحر بين نواكشوط ونواذيبو في مكان معروف اليوم باسم: «تيدره» ووضعا نظاما تدريبا قويا، وظل انصارهم يتزايدون، وبعد عشر سنوات تكونت لديهما جماعه قويه فعم صيتها وكثر اتباعها وعند ذلك اعلنوا الجهاد، وفتحوا المدن واخضعوا القبائل، وظل نفوذهم يمتد ويتسع؛ فاحتلوا درعه وسجلماسه واودغست، وفي اثناء حصار هذه المدينه قتل يحيى بن ابراهيم، فعينوا بعده يحيى بن عمر اللمتوني، ثم قتل عبد الله بن ياسين في المعركه التي دارت بينهم وبين قبيله «برغوطه» ثم بنوا مراكش فجعلوها عاصمه لهم، ووجهوا قوتهم الى الشمال بعد ما ضعف نفوذهم في الجنوب حتى وصلوا الى الاندلس مما جعلهم يؤخرون سقوط الاندلس قرابه اربعه قرون من الزمن، وكان لهذه الدوله الاسلاميه صلات قويه بالدول والمماليك الافريقيه، «فهذه البلاد كانت المركز الذي تربت فيه حركه المرابطين واندفعت منه تنشر الاسلام في نواحي كثيره وتحمي الاسلام بالاندلس من زحف الفرنجه» وعندما جاء الاسلام الى هذه المنطقه قدر لها ان تلعب دورا كبيرا في تاريخ الاسلام، وان تصبح مركزا وهاجا ينشر هذا الدين ويذود عنه في الشمال والجنوب، ومن اجل هذا ينبغي ان نفسح المجال لدراسه تاريخ الاسلام في هذه المنطقه المهمه.، ولما توفي يحي خلفه اخوه ابو بكر وابن عمه يوسف بن تاشفين، وبدا بهما ملك المرابطين الذي اتجه نحو الجنوب حتى بلاد السنغال، كما اتجه نحو الشمال حتى ضم اسبانيا والذي بدا التجييش له بقرب مدينه نواكشوط الحاليه.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nكانت نواكشوط جزءاً من اماره الترارزه، اذ انها كانت قريه صغيره نائيه يعيش سكانها على صيد السمك من المحيط وقد تعاقب على هذه المنطقه مجموعات محليه كان اخرها مجموعه صغيره من البيضان لم يساهم تواجدها في فك العزله عن القريه اذ لم تعتبر انذاك سوى منطقه نائيه يستخدمها بعض المتدينين للانعزال والتعبد.\n\nبناء نواكشوط\nكانت موريتانيا جزء من مستعمره غرب افريقيا الفرنسيه، ولذا لم يكن لها عاصمه اثناء فتره الاستعمار، حيث كانت سانت لويس هي عاصمه المستعمره. ولكن في عام 1957 اختيرت منطقه نواكشوط الساحليه لتصبح العاصمه للدوله الجديده وذلك بعد ان سمح السكان الاصليون لتلك المنطقه للرئيس المختار ولد داداه بعد طلبه رسميا لهم. واختير موقعها ليتوسط موريتانيا بين الشمال والجنوب، وتم البدء بمشروع اعمار طموح لزياده عدد سكانها ليصل الى 15 الف نسمه. وفي عام 1958، اصبحت موريتانيا منطقه حكم ذاتي ضمن السيطره الفرنسيه، وفي عام 1960، تم حل هذا الشكل من السيطره الفرنسيه واصبحت نواكشوط عاصمه لدوله مستقله.\nوقد تم اختيار المدينه لتكون عاصمه وذلك لمناخها المعتدل وموقعها المركزي في البلاد.\nانتقلت اليها الحكومه الموريتانيه بعد ان كان مقرها سان لويس على نهر السنغال في جنوب موريتانيا.\nلم تكن «نواكشوط» ترتبط في السابق باي قيمه حضاريه او ثقافيه في الوجدان الشعبي الموريتاني على خلاف العديد من المدن التاريخيه الاخرى مثل شنقيط في الشمال وولاته في الشرق وهو ما جعل الجدل بشان اختيارها عاصمه للجمهوريه الوليده لا يتوقف، اذ يعتبره كثيرون مؤامره فرنسيه لمنع ارتباط الدوله الحديثه باي قيمه تاريخيه للمجتمع الموريتانيوقد قيل ان الرئيس الاول لموريتانيا المختار ولد داداه قال بان اختيار نواكشوط كعاصمه كان موفقا لكونها تقع قرب الرباط الذي اقامه مؤسسو دوله المرابطين قبل اكثر من ثمانيه قرون.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nبعد بناء العاصمه وتركيز مختلف الادارات والخدمات بها ازداد عدد السكان الى 15 الف في ظرف 5 سنوات كان اغلبهم من اسر الكوادر الاداريه والتعليميه والعمال المحليين اضافه الى افراد السلك الامني والجيش والشرطه المنتدبين حديثاً. وقد ادّى الجفاف الذي ضرب البلد في سبعينيات القرن العشرين الى تدفق مئات الاسر باتجاه العاصمه الوليده وهو ما ضاعف بشكل كبير وسريع اعداد السكان. وقد هاجمت «جبهه البوليساريو» المدينه في عام 1976، كجزء من حركه استقلال الصحراء الغربيه. بين عامي 1988-1989، تصاعدت التوترات العرقيه بين بين العرب والسود. كان هناك تمييز وانتقام بين العرب والسود. بالاضافه الى ثلاثه ايام من «مظاهرات الخبز» بداً من 21 يناير 1995.\nوقد شهدت المدينه نموّاً سريعاً، بعد ذلك بسبب الجفاف في شمال افريقيا الذي اشتدت وطاته في بدايه عقد 1980. فانتقل العديد من السكان الى المدينه المبنيه حديثاً بحثاً عن حياه افضل. قُدر عدد السكان تحت مليون نسمه في عام 2000، ونمت الى مليوني نسمه في عام 2008.\nهناك حاليّاً عدد كبير من الصينين، يركّزون على الاستثمار في المدينه.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع نواكشوط على ساحل المحيط الاطلسي من الساحل الغربي لافريقيا. يُعد الشريط الساحلي للمدينه فارغاً، باستثناء مرسى نواكشوط وميناءها، الذي يسمح بحدوث فيضانات. يشمل الشريط الساحلي رمال متحركه وشواطئ رمليه. وهناك ايضا مناطق رمليه مُتحركه على مقربه من الميناء. وتغطي الكثبان الرمليه المدينه القادمه من الجهه الشرقيه (كما يظهر في الصوره المجاوره)، والتي تُشكل مُشكله يوميّاً. هُناك جهود كبيره لانقاذ مناطق معيّنه. اما المدينه فيغلب عليها الشكل المسطح.\nبُنيت نواكشوط حول شارع عبد الناصر الذي يمتازُ بالاشجار الكبيره على جانبيه، ويمتد شمال شرق البلاد من خلال مركز المدينه من المطار. تتم تسميه الشوارع الرئيسيه الاخرى باللغه الفرنسيه اقتداءً بشخصيات موريتانيه او دوليه بارزه من العقد 1960، على سبيل المثال: شارع عبد الناصر وشارع شارل ديغول وجاده كينيدي، وشارع لومومبا.\nتقع العاصمه في الجنوب الغربي لموريتانيا تعتبر ارضها سبخه وشديده الملوحه، وهي بعيده عن مصادر المياه العذبه كما لا يوجد جبال قريبه منها يمكن استخدام احجارها في البناء، اما الساحل فهو غير مناسب كثيراً ليكون ميناء طبيعي، فقد كان ضحلا يصلح للصيد.\nاما اليوم فان المياه الجوفيه التي في الصخور العميقه تحت نواكشوط توفر للمدينه حاجاتها من المياه، ولنواكشوط رصيف ميناء بحري يصل للمياه العميقه. وتشكل المدينه مركز تجمع سكاني يعتبر من الاكبر في منطقه الصحراء الكبرى اذا استثنيت المدن الواقعه على اطراف الصحراء كالقاهره في وادي النيل والمدن شمال جبال اطلس.\nلكن المدينه تعاني من خطر الغرق، لان اغلب احيائها تقع تحت مستوى مياه المحيط الاطلسي. ومن المفارقات ان احياءها الشرقيه والشماليه الشرقيه تواجه خطراً بيئيا مُغايرا، وهو الرمال الزاحفه التي لم تفلح محاولات الحكومه في وقفها، او وضع حد لتقدمها السريع نحو المباني والمنشات السكنيه.\n\nالتقسيم الاداري\nتم تقسيم المدينه لاول مره الى اربعه مقاطعات في عام 1973. من عام 1986، قُسمت المدينه الى تسع مناطق: وتنقسم اداريا الان الى 3 ولايات هي:\n\nالاقدم من بين احياء العاصمه، وعرفات الاكثر كثافه سكانيه، وتيارت والسبخه والميناء والرياض وتوجنين ودار النعيم.\nمن اهم معالم المدينه: المسجد الجامع
