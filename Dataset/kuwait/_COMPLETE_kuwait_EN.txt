The Kuwait Towers are a group of three  thin towers in Kuwait City, standing on a promontory into the Persian Gulf. They were the sixth, and last, group in the larger Kuwait Water Towers system of 34 towers (33 store water; one stores equipment), and were built in a style considerably different from the other five groups. The Kuwait Towers were officially inaugurated in March 1979 and are regarded as a landmark and symbol of modern Kuwait. The towers were closed for maintenance from March 2012 to 8 March 2016, with a massive fireworks festival commemorating the re-opening. Kuwait Towers facility is operated and managed by the state-owned Touristic Enterprises Company. The Main Tower served as the venue for TEDxKuwaitCity event in 2018 and 2019.

Design and construction
The main tower is 187 metres (614 ft) high and carries two spheres. The lower sphere holds in its bottom half a water tank of 4,500 cubic metres (1,200,000 US gal; 990,000 imp gal) and in its upper half there is a restaurant that accommodates 90 people, a café, a lounge and a reception hall. The upper sphere, which rises to 123 metres (404 ft) above sea level and completes a full turn every 30 minutes, holds a café. The second tower is 147 metres (482 ft) high and serves as a water tower. The third tower does not store water, housing equipment to illuminate the two larger towers. The two water towers hold 9,000 cubic metres (2,400,000 US gal; 2,000,000 imp gal) of water altogether.
The Kuwait Towers were designed by Danish architect Malene Bjørn as part of a water distribution project run by the Swedish engineering company VBB (renamed Sweco in 1997). Chief architect of the company and husband of Malene Bjørn, Sune Lindström, erected five groups of his typical "mushroom" water towers, the Kuwait Water Towers, but the Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed, wanted a more attractive design for the sixth site. Out of ten different designs, three were presented to the Amir, who chose the design built.
VBB contracted construction of the three Kuwait Towers to Union Inženjering construction company of Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now part of Serbia). The towers were built of reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete. Building took place from 1971 to 1976 and the main tower was opened to the public on 1 March 1979.
Approximately 41,000 enameled steel discs cover the three spheres in eight shades of blue, green and gray, recalling the tiled domes of historic mosques. The discs are arranged in spiral patterns around the spheres. According to the architect, the Kuwait Tower group refers to ideals of humanity and technology, symbolised by the globe and the rocket.
The towers were damaged heavily by the Iraqis during their occupation of Kuwait from 1990 to 1991. In 1991, after the liberation of Kuwait City during the First Gulf War, Vic Clarke of Nottingham UK abseiled the Kuwait Water Towers during structural surveys.

Recognition
In 1980, the Kuwait Water Towers system, including the Kuwait Towers, was an inaugural recipient of the Aga Khan Award for Architecture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Failaka Island (Arabic: فيلكا Faylakah / Fēlaka; Kuwaiti Arabic:فيلچه /fe:lɪt͡ʃə/) is a Kuwaiti Island in the Persian Gulf. The island is 20 km off the coast of Kuwait City in the Persian Gulf.
Failaka Island is located 50 km southeast of the spot where the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers empty into the Persian Gulf. For thousands of years, the island has been a strategic prize to control the lucrative trade that passed up and down the Persian Gulf. Failaka Island has been a strategic location since the rise of the Sumerian city-state of Ur. Due to its strategic location, Failaka Island has been continuously inhabited since antiquity. Up until the Gulf War, it was the longest continuously inhabited place in Kuwait.

Name
The name "Failaka" is thought to be derived from the ancient Greek φυλάκιο(ν) – fylakio(n) "outpost".

History
Antiquity
Failaka was settled following 2000 BC after a drop in sea level. Failaka has been a strategic location since the rise of the Sumerian city-state of Ur during the third millennium BC. Mesopotamians first settled the island in 2000 BC. Traders from the Sumerian city of Ur inhabited Failaka and ran a mercantile business. The island had many Mesopotamian-style buildings typical of those found in Iraq dating from around 2000 BC.
During the Dilmun era (from ca. 3000 BC), Failaka was known as "Agarum", the land of Enzak, a great god in the Dilmun civilization according to Sumerian cuneiform texts found on the island. During the Neo-Babylonian Period, Enzak was identified with Nabu, the ancient Mesopotamian patron god of literacy, the rational arts, scribes and wisdom. As part of Dilmun, Failaka became a hub for the civilization from the end of the 3rd to the middle of the 1st millennium BC. 

From about 1650 BC there is a further inscription on a seal found at Failaka and preserving a king's name. The short text readsː [La]'ù-la Panipa, daughter of Sumu-lěl, the servant of Inzak of Akarum. Sumu-lěl was evidently a third king of Dilmun belonging to about this period. Servant of Inzak of Akarum was the king's title in Dilmun. The names of these later rulers are Amoritic.
Despite the scholarly consensus that ancient Dilmun encompasses three modern locations - the eastern littoral of Arabia from the vicinity of modern Kuwait to Bahrain; the island of Bahrain; the island of Failaka of Kuwait - few researchers have taken into account the radically different geography of the basin represented by the Persian Gulf before its reflooding as sea levels rose about 6000 BCE.
Dilmun's commercial power began to decline after 1800 BC. Piracy flourished throughout the region during Dilmun's decline. After 600 BC, the Babylonians added Dilmun to their empire.
After the Dilmun civilization, Failaka was inhabited by the Kassites of Mesopotamia, and was formally under the control of the Kassite dynasty of Babylon. Studies indicate traces of human settlement can be found on Failaka dating back to as early as the end of the 3rd millennium BC, and extending until the 20th century AD. Many of the artifacts found in Falaika are linked to Mesopotamian civilizations and seem to show that Failaka was gradually drawn toward the civilization based in Antioch.
Under Nebuchadnezzar II, Failaka was under Babylonian control. Cuneiform documents found in Failaka indicate the presence of Babylonians in the island's population. Babylonian Kings were present in Failaka during the Neo-Babylonian Empire period, Nabonidus had a governor in Failaka and Nebuchadnezzar II had a palace and temple in Falaika. Failaka also contained temples dedicated to the worship of Shamash, the Mesopotamian sun god in the Babylonian pantheon.
After an apparent abandonment of about seven centuries,  the bay of Kuwait was repopulated during the Achaemenid period (c. 550‒330 BC). In 4th century BC, the ancient Greeks colonized the bay of Kuwait under Alexander the Great, the ancient Greeks named mainland Kuwait Larissa and Failaka was named Ikaros.
According to Strabo and Arrian, Alexander the Great named Failaka Ikaros because it resembled the Aegean island of that name in size and shape. Various elements of Greek mythology were mixed with the local cults in Failaka. "Ikaros" was also the name of a prominent city situated in Failaka.

According to another account, having returned from his Indian campaign to Persia, Alexander the Great ordered the island to be called Icarus, after the Icarus island in the Aegean Sea. This was likely a Hellenization of the local name Akar (Aramaic 'KR), derived from the ancient bronze-age toponym Agarum. Another suggestion is that the name Ikaros was influenced by the local É-kara temple, dedicated to the Babylonian sun-god Shamash. That both Failaka and the Aegean Icarus housed bull cults would have made the identification tempting all the more.
During Hellenistic times, there was a temple of Artemis on the island. The wild animals on the island were dedicated to the goddess and no one should harm them. Strabo wrote that on the island there was a temple of Apollo and an oracle of Artemis (Tauropolus) (μαντεῖον Ταυροπόλου). The island is also mentioned by Stephanus of Byzantium and Ptolemaeus.
Remains of the settlement include a large Hellenistic fort and two Greek temples. Failaka was also a trading post (emporion) of the kingdom of Characene. At the Hellenistic fortress in Failaka, pigs represented 20 percent of the total population, but no pig remains were found in nearby Akkaz.
Nearchos was likely the first Greek to have explored Failaka. The island was further visited and inspected by Archias, Androsthenes of Thasos, and Hiero during three exploration expeditions ordered by Alexander the Great during 324 BC. Failaka might have been fortified and settled during the days of Seleucus I or Antiochos I.
At the time of Alexander the Great, the mouth of the Euphrates River was located in northern Kuwait. The Euphrates river flowed directly into the Persian Gulf via Khor Subiya which was a river channel at the time. Failaka was located 15 kilometers from the mouth of the Euphrates river. By the first century BC, the Khor Subiya river channel dried out completely.
In 127 BC, the kingdom of Characene was established around Teredon in present-day Kuwait. Characene was centered in the region encompassing southern Mesopotamia, including Failaka island. A busy Parthian era Characene commercial station existed on Failaka island.
Failaka was also under the influence of the Achaemenid Empire. There are Aramaic inscriptions that testify Achaemenid presence.
There are also late Sassanian and early-to-late Islamic era settlements across Failaka.

Christian Nestorian settlements flourished in Failaka from the 5th century until the 9th century. Excavations have revealed several farms, villages and two large churches dating from the 5th and 6th century. Archaeologists are currently excavating nearby sites to understand the extent of the settlements that flourished in the eighth and ninth centuries A.D. An old island tradition is that a community grew up around a Christian mystic and hermit. The small farms and villages were eventually abandoned. Remains of Byzantine era Nestorian churches were found at Al-Qusur in Failaka. Pottery at the site can be dated from as early as the first half of the 7th century through the 9th century.

Modern era
Similar to mainland Kuwait, much of the island’s history between the 8th and 15th centuries remains undocumented, with no evidence of continuous habitation.  In the modern era, the earliest recorded presence on the island is that of Sheikh Musaeed Al-Azmi of Al-Awazim tribe, who was born on the island. In 1682, he published a copy of Muwatta Imam Malik, which is considered to be the oldest document in Kuwait’s modern history.

Prior to the 1990 Iraqi Invasion, the island had over two thousand residents and several schools. The village of Al-Zawr or Zoor is situated near the middle of the northwest side of the island. It was the longest continuously inhabited location in Kuwait. During 1990 and 1991, the invading Iraqis depopulated the island, expelling all of its residents to the mainland. The Iraqi military mined the beaches and used the island's facilities and buildings for target practice. In 1991, the allied forces forced the Iraqi army forces occupying the island to surrender through bombing and psywar operations. The sewage system was destroyed and has yet to be fully repaired. Also, many old homes continue to sit empty and decaying.
After the war, Failaka was cleared of mines, but it remains under military use to some extent. Nevertheless, Failaka Island is becoming a popular holiday destination from Kuwait City since the establishment of the "Wanasa Beach" resort including live music, horse-riding, canoeing, and kayaking activities.

Climate, geography and the future
Failaka Island is located in the northern part of the Persian Gulf. Springtime on Failaka Island is regarded as particularly special by Kuwaitis. Failaka has quite a different ecosystem than mainland Kuwait and its budding flowers and changing temperatures are much appreciated. Although the island's infrastructure remains poor, Failaka is beginning to develop a local tourist industry based upon fishing, boating, swimming, sailing and other water sports.
The few remaining local residents are mostly those Failakawans who lived with their families on the island prior to the Iraqi Invasion of 1990. Most Failakawans have their own boats; while some are involved in tourism, many others are reticent about letting tourism detract from the quiet island life. Some Failakawan families, although now living in mainland Kuwait, regularly go to the island on weekends.
On the mainland, in Kuwait City, various schemes have been discussed to build a bridge to the island and develop Failaka into a vacation paradise. A new hotel resort has encouraged many of the improvements.
On July 15, 2024, Kuwait’s state-owned E&P company Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) has revealed a "large" light oil and associated gas discovery at an offshore field east of Failaka Island. The preliminary estimates of the hydrocarbon reserves were around 2.1 billion barrels of light oil, and 5.1 trillion standard cubic feet of gas, which brings into play about 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe).

Archaeology
The site was excavated by a Danish team led by Geoffrey Bibby between 1958 and 1963. They excavated at four tells in the southwest corner of Failaka, Tell F3, Tell F4, Tell F5 and Tell F6. Tells F4 and F5 dated to the Hellenistic period. Tells F3 (small domestic houses) and F6 (a 400 meter square structure the excavators named the "Palace") dated to the early 2nd millennium BC and covered an area of about 7500 square meters at a height of about 4 meters. About 50 cylinder seals and about 400 stamp seals were found. The oldest cylinder seals were a few from the post-Akkadian, Ur III Empire period, and Old Babylonian period but most were from the Mitanni  and Kassite periods with a few of Elamite origin from the time of the 2nd dynasty of Isin. The majority of the stamp seals were of the Dilmun type, first found at the ancient city of Ur A few of the seals had cuneiform inscriptions including one that read "Marduk, excellent prince, merciful god, praised in heaven and on earth, have mercy". Over the years a number of cuneiform seal inscriptions, inscribed stone fragments, and tablet fragments have been found at the site.
A site chronology was established:

Period 4B - c. 1300-1400 BC
Period 4A - c. 1400-1500 BC, Kassite period
Period 3B - c. 1500-1600 BC
Period 3A - c. 1600-1700 BC, Old Babylonian period
Period 2B - c. 1700-1800 BC
Periods 1/2A - c. 1800-2200 BC, Isin-Larsa and Ur III periods
A group from the United States worked in 1974 and 1975 after a reconnaissance in 1972. Between 1984 and 1988 (after a premininary survey in 1983) a French team excavated at the site. On Tell F6 they found a structure they called a "temple", with 2.8 meter thick walls, 15 meters east of the "Palace" and further down two Dilmun seals. Much of the early stonework had been robbed during construction of the nearby Hellenistic fortress. A small (1.8 meter high) Tell G3 was opened on the north end of the site finding two c.2000 BC occupation levels (both stone robbed with a destruction layer between) before hitting virgin soil. A Hellenistic period area B6 200 meters south of the fortress on Tell F5 was excavated. A sanctuary was found with numerous votive objects. Small finds included several bronze coins, a large number of iron or bronze arrowheads, finger rings, a steatite seal, and a number of stone fish-net rings. Several hundred meters north the small site of Tell Khazneh, largely stone-robbed by villagers, was excavated finding a block with an Aramaic inscription. 
A team from Georgia excavated at Failaka between 2011 and 2017 focusing on the Al-Awazim area on the northeast coast of the island. An Italian group worked on the island from 2010 until 2014. After a survey in 2012 Polish excavators worked at the Islamic period site Kharaib el-Desht in the northwest part of the island in 2013, 2015, and 2016. Archaeologists from  Slovakia and Greece  have also worked there. There are indications the site was occupied in the Neo-Babylonian period based on a grave and a foundation stone inscription (found reused in a modern home near Tell F6) "This palace belongs to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon".
In 2025, archaeologists discovered a courtyard and a building at Al-Qurainiya, dating back to the Hellenistic period. The discovery is important because it shows Hellenistic presence also to the northern part of the island.

Population
The majority of Kuwaitis from Failaka Island are of Iranian ancestry. They originally migrated to Failaka from the Iranian coast, mainly Kharg Island and Bandar Lengeh. These people are commonly known as the Huwala in the GCC states. They are predominantly Sunni Muslims and speak Arabic fluently, although prior to the discovery of oil they also spoke fluent Persian. The most important Huwala settlement in Failaka Island pertained to 40 families who migrated from the Iranian island Kharg to Failaka in the years 1841–1842. The most recent settlement occurred in the early 1930s after the imposition of the unveiling law by Reza Shah. A minority of Failaka Island's Kuwaiti families are Shia Persians, they were noted as having their own Hussainiyas and the older generations were frequent Arabic speakers, unlike the Kuwaiti Shia of Persian origin in mainland Kuwait City at the time.

Seif Palace (Arabic: قصر السيف) is a palace in Kuwait City, Kuwait. Located opposite the Grand Mosque, one of Seif Palace's best-known features is the watch tower, covered in blue tiles and with a roof plated in pure gold. Local materials such as clay, rocks, limestone, wood and metals were used in its construction.

Overview
The tower of the Seif Palace received a direct hit from an incoming missile during the first Gulf War (1990–91), which destroyed the dial room. British clockmaker Smith of Derby Group replaced the iconic clock, and were the only non-US company to be awarded a contract in this reconstructive period.

Souq Al-Mubarakiya is a historic souq in Kuwait City, Kuwait. It is one of the oldest souqs in Kuwait, and was a center of trade prior to the discovery of oil.
This popular traditional market is located in Kuwait City, between Abdullah Al-Mubarak, Abdullah Al-Salem & Palestine Streets. This market has been around for at least 200 years. The market was damaged during the Iraqi invasion in 1990; however, it was renovated and it got back its traditional flavor.
Vendors sell goods such as Persian silk carpets, antiques, perfumes like musk and oud, gold and silver jewelry, and traditional costumes. Other goods sold at Al-Mubarakiya include dates, honey, spices, sweets, vegetables, fruits, meat, and fish. The market also hosts two small museums: Sheikh Mubarak Kiosk and the first pharmacy in Kuwait. Admission is free.
There is a courtyard near Masjid Al-Bahar (Sea Mosque) with traditional cafes that brew tea over coals, and several small restaurants serve authentic Arab and Persian food to the customers in the open air. On hot summer days, water mist is sprayed from pipes over the tables to cool visitors down. A children playground is nearby and shisha is also available.
On 31 March 2022, a section of the market was damaged by a massive fire that destroyed shops. As of April 2025, that zone is still under reconstruction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Tareq Rajab Museum (Arabic: متحف طارق رجب) is located in Kuwait and houses an extensive collection of artefacts accumulated over a fifty-year period commencing in the 1950s. The Museum is housed at two separate locations in Jabriya, Kuwait: the Tareq Rajab Museum, which was founded in 1980, and the Tareq Rajab Museum of Islamic Calligraphy in 2007. The Tareq Rajab Museum includes collections of manuscripts and miniatures, ceramics, metalwork, glass, arms and armour as well as textiles, costumes and jewellery. The museum's ceramics collection is very large and comprehensive, and includes objects from pre-Islamic times up to the early 20th century and from across the breadth of the Islamic world. The museum houses one of the foremost collections of silver jewellery as well as a fine collection of gold jewellery much of which dates from pre-Islamic times. There is a large collection of Qurans and manuscripts from all periods, with the earliest dating to the 7th century AD and from across the whole Islamic world. From important Qurans, to rare manuscripts such as the Al-Kindi book on optics and a folio from the Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp, the range of works is comprehensive and representative of many styles and regions.
The Tareq Rajab Museum is fully funded by the Rajab family and today, the third generation of the family are actively involved with its operations and management.

History
The collection
Tareq Al-Sayid Rajab's journey into collecting began with a trip to Baghdad as a fourteen-year-old boy in the 1940s, which then progressed to book and manuscript collecting in England during the 1950s. As a student, he received a weekly allowance from Kuwait's Educational Office in London, which he spent largely on books. The Educational Office was very supportive, often reimbursing him for book purchases without question, considering them educational. By the 1960s, Tareq and his wife Jehan had travelled extensively by car around the Middle East, sometimes even driving to England. When they spent a year in Denmark, they also made the journey by car. During these long journeys, they started collecting items from dealers in cities such as Damascus and Istanbul, as well as from remote villages in Syria, Palestine, and Iran. Jehan, with her anthropological interest in people and cultures, played a significant role in these efforts.
The aim of these trips was not only to enjoy themselves but also to photograph and collect cultural artefacts to help preserve aspects of various cultures being lost to rapid modernisation. In those days, modern road systems in many countries they visited had not been built, so Tareq and Jehan often drove across rough roads, through mountains, and camped beside villages and tribes. They would meet the local people and often managed to buy artefacts directly from them. In the 1960s, Istanbul was not as touristic as it is today, allowing them to find many interesting objects, especially ethnic items, which few people were interested in at the time.
The idea to build a museum of Islamic art originated with Tareq Rajab during his tenure as the Kuwait's Director of Museums and Antiquities in the 1960s, then a branch of the Ministry of Education. Despite his repeated proposals and ideas, there was little interest from his superiors and no budget allocated for such a project. However, Tareq had developed a genuine interest in the arts of the Islamic world, and by the early 1970s, he began collecting seriously, transitioning from a hobbyist to a dedicated collector. With the New English School firmly established, Tareq had more time to travel and attend auctions in London. He acquired items from auction houses such as Sotheby's, Christie's, Bonhams, and others. In the 1970s, it was very much a buyer's market, long before buyers from the Gulf took an interest. Tareq also attended sales in old British stately homes, purchasing artefacts such as manuscripts, ceramics, metalwork, and glass. His growing reputation in the market led several dealers to approach him, enabling him to acquire numerous interesting artefacts, including the enamelled jewels of the Sultan of Bukhara, which are currently on display.
Initially, Tareq focused on ceramics, manuscripts, metalwork, and glass. By the mid-1970s, he had amassed a sizeable collection and displayed most of the objects in his house. It was at this point that he began to seriously consider establishing a museum to share his collection with the public. At that time, Kuwait had very few educational resources on the artistic history of the Islamic world. One of Tareq's objectives was to create a venue where people living in and visiting Kuwait could learn about this rich heritage. Tareq decided to house the museum in a villa he owned in Jabriya, near the New English School. The museum remains in this location to this day. Work on the museum began in the late 1970s, and by 1980, it was formally established and inaugurated, becoming the first Islamic Art museum in Kuwait and the entire Gulf region.

Iraqi Invasion and Occupation of Kuwait (1990-1991)
The Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait commenced in the early morning of August 2, 1990. At the time, Tareq Rajab was in Jordan, and his two eldest children, Nur and Ziad, were traveling abroad. His wife, Jehan, and their youngest son, Nader, remained in Kuwait throughout the occupation. The invasion took many Kuwaitis by surprise; Jehan first became aware of the situation upon being awakened by the sounds of explosions, sustained gunfire, and Iraqi helicopters overhead. On the first day of the occupation, she managed to contact her daughter Nur and her husband Tareq, but soon after, international telephone lines were cut, severing their communication with the outside world for over seven months. However, Kuwait's internal telephone lines remained operational, allowing news to spread quickly within the country.
Aware of the need to protect the family's museum, which was fortunately situated below ground level, Jehan and Nader decided to secure and conceal it. They bolted the museum's heavy carved Indian doors, removed identifying signs, and descended into the museum to safeguard its exhibits. Priority was given to packing and hiding valuable manuscripts and ceramics. Many maintenance workers from the nearby New English School, despite attempts to flee Kuwait, stayed to assist Jehan and Nader in their efforts, which were described as "frantic though purposeful." A guard was stationed upstairs to warn of any intrusions. Jehan contacted Tareq's foreman, Nasser, to arrange for carpenters and builders to assist immediately. During the packing process, a small 19th-century grain of rice inscribed with verses from the Qur’an was so well concealed that it remains lost to this day. Meanwhile, Tareq remained in Amman for a short time, overseeing the New English School he had opened there and writing letters to Jehan, which were smuggled into Kuwait by one of his Palestinian drivers who could travel between Jordan and Kuwait.
Within a few days, the left side of the museum was filled with packed boxes, suitcases, and bags, while the showcases were emptied. These items were hidden in side rooms and a large space behind one of the bigger showcases, then blocked off and concealed. Doors were bolted shut, and carpenters used sheets of wood to seal them, painting over the wood to match the walls. David Roberts lithographs, considered of little interest to Iraqi soldiers, were hung on the false walls to complete the disguise. By the end of the occupation, Iraqi soldiers had forced open and ransacked every cupboard and drawer in the nearby New English School, leaving none unbroken.
With the manuscripts and ceramics secured, attention turned to the thousands of pieces of jewellery, costumes, textiles, embroideries, and stringed instruments on the opposite side. As most helpers had left Kuwait or could not reach the museum, Jehan, Nader, Rawa Adawa, and Nasser managed this task. They decided to completely block off that section and pretend it did not exist. The Gold Room in this area was further sealed off and hidden; the marks from the false wall are still visible today. The museum was secured, and the Rajab's awaited the Iraqi arrival. The New English School, being large and prominent, was seized by the Iraqi army and used as a base. Pillboxes and anti-aircraft weaponry were installed on the roof, causing significant disturbances in the neighborhood when fired. The school's stores contained between three and five hundred hand-woven Iraqi carpets, collected by Tareq and Jehan from the Marsh Arabs of southern Iraq. This entire collection was stolen and destroyed during the occupation, with some remnants found around the school after liberation.
Their home was searched multiple times, and Iraqi soldiers attempted to rob them on several occasions. As the end of the occupation approached, Jehan and Nader's efforts to hide the museum seemed successful. However, just before the ground war began, Iraqi secret police and army personnel arrived at their home, blocking the road with a machine gun-mounted vehicle. After conducting another search of the house, the secret police demanded that Nader show them the basement, where they seemed to know the museum was located. They forced their way in but were primarily searching for arms and munitions. Satisfied with Nader's explanations regarding the jewellery's lack of value, they left, taking only two cartons of cigarettes and three cassette tapes. Although they promised to return the following day, the onset of the ground war, leading to Kuwait's liberation, prevented their return.
The timely start of the ground war meant that Iraqi soldiers and secret police did not have the opportunity to revisit the museum. While much of the collection was preserved, the destruction of the Iraqi carpets and the looting of the New English School represented significant losses for the Rajab family.

Post invasion and present day
After Kuwait's liberation in 1991, Jehan Rajab was approached by the French Foreign Legion, who requested to use the New English School as their headquarters in Kuwait. Together, they re-equipped and staffed the school, successfully reopening its doors in the autumn.
During the school's use as a base, Jehan interacted with many military personnel, including members of the American Army. She met Colonel Jeffrey Greenhut, an American officer tasked with evaluating damage to cultural sites around Kuwait, including the museum. Colonel Greenhut's unit assisted in reopening the false walls around the museum and provided generators for electricity. Jehan developed a good rapport with him, and he invited her to fly to Failaka Island on an American helicopter. Failaka had always held a special place in her heart, and seeing the destruction wrought by the Iraqi army on the island and throughout Kuwait deeply saddened her. The cultural devastation and the uprooting of an entire community, which had lived there for centuries, was particularly painful.
After Kuwait's liberation, the Hungarian government appointed Géza Fehérvári, a British citizen of Hungarian origin, as ambassador to Kuwait and Riyadh. Géza, a professor of Islamic Art and Archaeology at the University of London (SOAS), was a frequent visitor to the museum and had developed a close relationship with Tareq Rajab, becoming the museums first curator.

Collections
Manuscripts and calligraphy
The Tareq Rajab Museum houses a very large and significant collection of Qur'ans and manuscripts from various periods and regions across the Islamic world.
Some of the earliest examples in the museum include a 7th-century 'Ma'il' Script folio from Hijaz, modern-day Saudi Arabia, and 9th-century Qur'ans written on vellum from North and East Africa. The museum also houses what is believed to be the only known complete and dated Qur'an written in Kufic script, from AD 1002. On display are also Qur'ans written in China and a number of interesting and very large Indonesian Qur'ans written on palm leaves, which are on display at the Tareq Rajab Museum of Islamic Calligraphy. Also on display at the Calligraphy museum, are a large number of Hilya. In addition to religious texts, the museum displays significant manuscripts by great philosophers and scientists such as Qusta ibn Luqa al-Ba'albaki and Ya'qub Ibn Ishaq Al-Kindi.

The Gold Room
Since the 1980s, the "Gold Room" at the Tareq Rajab Museum has showcased the Rajab family's collection of gold jewellery. This display includes gold jewellery from pre-Islamic Arabia, the medieval period, Mughal India, the Indian subcontinent, Tibet, and Nepal. The collection features several significant items, such as a Fatimid gold bracelet, a head ornament once owned by the Mughal Emperor Humayun, a necklace belonging to Princess Salme of Zanzibar and Oman, and a necklace of the Living Goddess.
The Gold Room has its own unique history. During the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the collection was hidden behind a false wall, preventing its discovery by Iraqi soldiers and secret police who had found the museum just before the ground war began. After Kuwait's liberation, the Gold Room was reopened by the 352nd Civil Affairs Command

Ceramics
The Tareq Rajab Museum's ceramics collection is one of its highlights, featuring an extensive array of objects from all periods and regions of the Islamic world. This collection provides a comprehensive overview of the development of ceramic art in Islamic cultures, showcasing pieces that reflect both utilitarian functions and artistic excellence.

Some of the earliest examples in the collection include pre-Islamic monochrome glazed amphorae and jars from Syria or Iran, dating back to the Parthian period. These pieces are notable for their simplicity and historical significance, offering insights into the early stages of ceramic craftsmanship in the region. The Islamic ceramic collection spans several key periods. From the Umayyad period, there are early Islamic ceramics that demonstrate the initial fusion of Islamic and pre-Islamic artistic traditions. The collection also includes lead-glazed relief wares from the Abbasid period, which are distinguished by their intricate designs and innovative glazing techniques.

Further enriching the collection are ceramics from the sgraffito tradition, originating from Egypt, Syria, Iran, and Central Asia. These pieces are characterised by their distinctive scratched designs, revealing contrasting colours beneath the surface glaze. The collection also includes exquisite Timurid ceramics, known for their elaborate decoration and vibrant colours, Iznik ware and Safavid and Qajar tilework and pottery. The museum aims to illustrate the evolution of Islamic pottery, tracing the development from the early, closely related Umayyad and Abbasid examples to the later, more intricate and colourful pieces such as Iznik tiles. This progression highlights the increasing sophistication and regional diversification of Islamic ceramic art.
Adding to the diversity of the collection are Islamic-influenced Hungarian Zsolnay ceramics from the 19th century, part of the extensive collection of Denise Rajab.

Arms and armour
The Tareq Rajab Museum houses an extensive collection of arms and armour from across the Islamic world. Before the museum's opening in 1980, the Rajab family's collection was primarily focused on the Arabian Peninsula. However, it quickly expanded to include various forms from throughout the Islamic world. By the late 1990s, the museum began displaying a diverse collection of firearms, gunpowder flasks, swords, daggers, axes, and armour.
The firearms collection today is one of the most important collections of Islamic firearms globally, featuring 200 guns, 80 of which are on permanent display. While many of the firearms originate from the Indian subcontinent, there are also numerous examples from Turkey, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Iran, North Africa, Arabia, and Afghanistan, all dating from the 17th to the 19th century.

The sword and dagger collections are equally comprehensive. Currently, 41 swords are on display, with examples from North Africa to Southeast Asia and everywhere in between. The dagger collection includes 73 pieces on permanent display. Both collections highlight the similarities and differences in the styles and techniques used in the production of arms in the Islamic world, each reflecting the unique cultural characteristics of its origin. Notable examples on display include swords once belonging to Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah and Sir Bijay Chand Mahtab, and daggers owned by Francis Rawdon-Hastings and Sir Richard Turnbull.
Additionally, the museum showcases various examples of armour, including chainmail, helmets, and shields. Most of the armour collection originates from India and Iran. However, the earliest piece on display is a set of early 16th-century Ottoman mirror armour, stamped with the mark of the Irene arsenal.

Glass
The Tareq Rajab Museum's collection of glass objects spans from the early Islamic period to the late Mughal period in India. One of the earliest pieces is an 8th-century mould-blown inkwell from Mesopotamia or Iran, demonstrating early Islamic glassmaking techniques. The collection includes mould-blown glass objects such as a blue glass vase and a perfume vase from 11th-century Iran. Additionally, the museum houses beakers, cut glass flasks, jugs, ewers, and stem-cups from the 8th to the 14th century AD, showcasing the variety of glassware used in Islamic societies. A notable highlight is a pair of glass polychrome painted bottles from the 18th-century late Mughal period in India, known for their vibrant colours and detailed designs.

Metalwork
The Tareq Rajab Museum's collection of Islamic metalwork, although more narrowly focused than its other collections, is particularly notable for its pieces from the Seljuq period of Iran and Central Asia (12th – 14th century AD). This collection also includes significant vessels from other regions of the Islamic world, including Egypt and Syria.
One of the earliest objects in the collection is a 7th-century AD bronze incense burner, believed to have originated in Syria during the Umayyad period. This piece shares many similarities with Byzantine vessels of the same type. A number of very large and rare cast bronze Islamic incense burners from 12th-century Afghanistan, are also on display. Additionally, the collection features a Fatimid bronze lion incense burner from the 11th – 12th century AD, which serves as the museum's mascot.
The museum also houses a variety of other metal objects, including ewers, pitchers, jugs, trays, bowls, cauldrons, oil lamps, inkwells and Sufi amulets. Each piece in this collection not only demonstrates the exquisite craftsmanship of its time but also reflects the diverse cultural influences and artistic traditions that have shaped Islamic metalwork throughout history. By highlighting the intricacies and beauty of these metalworks, the museum offers a comprehensive view of the rich heritage and artistic legacy of Islamic civilisation.

Silver jewellery
The Tareq Rajab Museum holds a vast and diverse collection of silver jewellery. This collection encompasses not only the jewellery of the Arab world but also that of the entire Islamic world. The museum serves as a significant resource for understanding the jewellery worn by people across different social strata, from the very poor to the wealthiest members of society. It offers more than just an exhibition of precious metals and gemstones; it provides insight into the cultural tastes and technical skills of various societies.
The jewellery collection includes thousands of individual pieces, reflecting a wide range of styles, materials, and techniques. Some notable examples include a Turkoman 'asyk' from Afghanistan or Iran, and a 'hunkun' or 'hirz' necklace from the Sultanate of Oman, adorned with gold decorations and Empress Maria Theresa thalers. Enamelled silver jewellery belonging to the last Amirs of Bukhara (circa 1885–1920) are also on display.

Orientalist artwork
The Tareq Rajab Museum houses a notable collection of artwork by prominent Orientalists such as David Roberts, Carl Haag, Frederick Goodall, Tomas Moragas, and other lesser-known artists of the period. Although much of the collection is currently in storage, several important pieces are on display. These include portraits of Lady Jane Digby el-Mesrab at Palmyra and her husband Sheikh Mijuel el-Mesrab (Palmyra).

Textiles, embroideries and costumes
The Tareq Rajab Museum houses a large and important collection of textiles, embroideries, and costumes, featuring significant acquisitions from Syria, Palestine, Jordan, and various regions of Ottoman Turkey. This extensive collection also includes items from Afghanistan, North Africa, Indonesia, Iran, and India. The collection includes a variety of hats and headwear, many of which are adorned with embroidery, coins, beads, cowrie shells, and the popular 'pearl' buttons. While the museum houses a large number of costumes, only a select few are currently on display.

Additionally, the museum holds examples of 'Al-Sadu' or Bedouin weaving from Kuwait. These old Kuwaiti pieces are rare as they were typically used until they were worn out. Unfortunately, a significant number of carpets from Iraq and Iran were lost during the Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait. An important aspect of the textile collection are the museums Holy Coverings. Among these are four curtains (Sitara) that were used to cover the entrance to the Ka'aba.

Musical instruments
The Tareq Rajab Museum houses a diverse collection of musical instruments from the Islamic world, spanning the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries AD. This collection features a variety of the three main instruments of classical music: 'El Oud' (the lute), 'El Qanun' (the zither), and 'El Ney' (the flute). Additionally, the museum's collection includes drums, fiddles, and tambourines. A particularly notable piece within the collection is a North Indian ivory 'Sarinda,' dating to approximately AD 1800.

Museum of Islamic calligraphy
The Tareq Rajab Museum of Islamic Calligraphy is a branch of the main Tareq Rajab Museum and is dedicated to the display of Islamic calligraphy in various forms of Arabic script. It was opened to the public in 2007 by the British Ambassador to Kuwait at the time, Stuart Laing. On display are the museum's collection of Holy Coverings, a large number of manuscripts, calligraphic art and a small number of decorated ceramics, metalwork and glass.

Kuwait City ( ; Arabic: مدينة الكويت, romanised: Madinat al-Kuwayt) is the capital and largest city of Kuwait. Located at the heart of the country on the south shore of Kuwait Bay on the Persian Gulf, it is the political, cultural and economic centre of the emirate, containing Kuwait's Seif Palace, government offices, and the headquarters of most Kuwaiti corporations and banks.
As of 2018, the metropolitan area had roughly three million inhabitants (more than 70% of the country's population). The city itself has no administrative status. All six governorates of the country comprise parts of the urban agglomeration, which is subdivided into numerous areas. In a narrower sense, Kuwait City can also refer only to the town's historic core, which nowadays is part of the Capital Governorate and seamlessly merges with the adjacent urban areas.
Kuwait City's trade and transportation needs are served by Kuwait International Airport, Mina Al-Shuwaik (Shuwaik Port) and Mina Al Ahmadi (Ahmadi Port).

History
In the early to mid 1700s, Kuwait City was a small fishing village. Sometime in the mid 1700s, the Bani Utubs settled in Kuwait. At the time of the arrival of the Utubs, Kuwait was inhabited by a few fishermen. In the eighteenth century, Kuwait gradually became a principal commercial centre for the transit of goods between India, Muscat, Baghdad, Persia, and Arabia. By the late 1700s, Kuwait had already established itself as a trading route from the Persian Gulf to Aleppo.
During the Persian siege of Basra in 1775–1779, Iraqi merchants took refuge in Kuwait and were partly instrumental in the expansion of Kuwait's boat-building and trading activities. As a result, Kuwait's maritime commerce boomed. Between the years 1775 and 1779, the Indian trade routes with Baghdad, Aleppo, Smyrna and Constantinople were diverted to Kuwait. The East India Company was diverted to Kuwait in 1792. The East India Company secured the sea routes between Kuwait, India and the east coasts of Africa. After the Persian  withdrawal  from Basra in 1779, Kuwait continued to attract trade away from Basra.

Kuwait was the centre of boat building in the Persian Gulf region. During the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, ship vessels made in Kuwait carried the bulk of trade between the ports of India, East Africa and the Red Sea. Kuwaiti ship vessels were renowned throughout the Indian Ocean. Regional geopolitical turbulence helped foster economic prosperity in Kuwait in the second half of the 18th century. Kuwait became prosperous due to Basra's instability in the late 18th century. At the time, Kuwait functioned partly as a haven for Basra's merchants fleeing Ottoman persecution. According to Palgrave, Kuwaitis developed a reputation as the best sailors in the Persian Gulf.
During the reign of Mubarak Al-Sabah, Kuwait was dubbed the "Marseille of the Gulf" because its economic vitality attracted a large variety of people. In the first decades of the twentieth century, Kuwait had a well-established elite: wealthy trading families who were linked by marriage and shared economic interests.
In 1937, Freya Stark wrote about the extent of poverty in Kuwait at the time:

Poverty has settled in Kuwait more heavily since my last visit five years ago, both by sea, where the pearl trade continues to decline, and by land, where the blockade established by Saudi Arabia now harms the merchants.
Some prominent merchant families left Kuwait in the early 1930s due to the prevalence of economic hardship. At the time of the discovery of oil in 1937, most of Kuwait's inhabitants were impoverished.
From 1946 to 1982, Kuwait experienced a period of prosperity driven by oil and its liberal atmosphere. In popular discourse, the years between 1946 and 1982 are referred to as the "Golden Era". In 1950, a major public-works programme began to enable Kuwaitis to enjoy a modern standard of living. By 1952, the country became the largest oil exporter in the Persian Gulf region. In the following year, the country's annual oil income grew to $169 million. This massive growth attracted many foreign workers, especially from Jordan, Egypt and India and helped finance the development of a new master plan, which the state approved in 1952. In June 1961, Kuwait became independent with the end of the British protectorate and the sheikh Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah became an Emir. Under the terms of the newly drafted constitution, Kuwait held its first parliamentary elections in 1963. Kuwait was the first Persian Gulf country to establish a constitution and parliament.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Kuwait was the most developed country in the region. Kuwait was the pioneer in the Middle East in diversifying its earnings away from oil exports. The Kuwait Investment Authority is the world's first sovereign wealth fund. From the 1970s onward, Kuwait scored highest of all Arab countries on the Human Development Index. Kuwait University was established in 1966. Kuwait's theatre industry was well-known throughout the Arab world. In the 1960s and 1970s, Kuwait's press was described as one of the freest in the world. Kuwait was the pioneer in the literary renaissance in the Arab region. In 1958, Al Arabi magazine was first published, the magazine went on to become the most popular magazine in the Arab world. Many Arab writers moved to Kuwait for freedom of expression because Kuwait had greater freedom of expression than elsewhere in the Arab world. Kuwait was a haven for writers and journalists from all parts of the Middle East, with the Iraqi poet Ahmed Matar leaving Iraq in the 1970s to take refuge in the more liberal environment of Kuwait.
Kuwaiti society embraced liberal and Western attitudes throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Most Kuwaiti women did not wear the hijab in the 1960s and 1970s. At Kuwait University, mini-skirts were more common than the hijab.
In the early 1980s, Kuwait experienced a major economic crisis after the Souk Al-Manakh stock market crash and decrease in oil price.
The Kuwait National Assembly Building, a parliament building designed by the works of Jørn Utzon in its elements of Islamic architecture, was completed in 1982 by orders of his son Jan Utzon.
During the Iran–Iraq War, Kuwait supported Iraq. Throughout the 1980s, there were several terror attacks in Kuwait, including the 1983 Kuwait bombings, hijacking of several Kuwait Airways planes and attempted assassination of Emir Jaber in 1985. Kuwait was a leading regional hub of science and technology in the 1960s and 1970s up until the early 1980s, the scientific research sector significantly suffered due to the terror attacks.

The Kuwaiti government strongly advocated Islamism throughout the 1980s. At that time, the most serious threat to the continuity of Al Sabah came from home-grown secular democrats. The secular Kuwaiti opposition were protesting the 1976 suspension of the parliament. Al Sabah were attracted to Islamists preaching the virtues of a hierarchical order that included loyalty to the Kuwaiti monarchy. In 1981, the Kuwaiti government gerrymandered electoral districts in favour of the Islamists. Islamists were the government's main allies, hence Islamists were able to colonise state agencies, such as the government ministries. By the mid-1980s, Kuwait was described as an autocracy. In 1986, Emir Jaber suspended the parliament.

After the Iran–Iraq War ended, Kuwait declined an Iraqi request to forgive its US$65 billion debt. An economic rivalry between the two countries ensued after Kuwait increased its oil production by 40 percent. Tensions between the two countries increased further in July 1990, after Iraq complained to OPEC claiming that Kuwait was stealing its oil from a field near the Iraq–Kuwait border by slant drilling of the Rumaila field.
In August 1990, Iraqi forces invaded and annexed Kuwait. After a series of failed diplomatic negotiations, the United States led a coalition to remove the Iraqi forces from Kuwait, in what became known as the Gulf War. On 26 February 1991, the coalition succeeded in driving out the Iraqi forces. As they retreated, Iraqi forces carried out a scorched earth policy by setting oil wells on fire. During the Iraqi occupation, more than 1,000 Kuwaiti civilians were killed. In addition, more than 600 Kuwaitis went missing during Iraq's occupation, approximately 375 remains were found in mass graves in Iraq.
In March 2003, Kuwait became the springboard for the US-led invasion of Iraq. Upon the death of the Emir Jaber, in January 2006, Saad Al-Sabah succeeded him but was removed nine days later by the Kuwaiti parliament due to his ailing health. Sabah Al-Sabah was sworn in as Emir.

Geography
Kuwait City is located on Kuwait Bay, a natural deep-water harbor. Ninety percent of Kuwait's population live within the Kuwait Bay coast. The country is generally low-lying, with the highest point being 306 m (1,004 ft) above sea level. It has nine islands, all of which, with the exception of Failaka Island, are uninhabited. With an area of 860 km2 (330 sq mi), Bubiyan is the largest island in Kuwait and is connected to the rest of the country by a 2,380-metre-long (7,808 ft) bridge. The land area  is considered arable and sparse vegetation is found along its 499-kilometre-long (310 mi) coastline.
Kuwait's Burgan field has a total capacity of approximately 70 billion barrels (1.1×1010 m3) of proven oil reserves. During the 1991 Kuwaiti oil fires, more than 500 oil lakes were created covering a combined surface area of about 35.7 km2 (13.8 sq mi). The resulting soil contamination due to oil and soot accumulation had made eastern and south-eastern parts of Kuwait uninhabitable. Sand and oil residue had reduced large parts of the Kuwaiti desert to semi-asphalt surfaces. The oil spills during the Gulf War also drastically affected Kuwait's marine resources.

Climate
Kuwait City has a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh) with extremely hot, very prolonged summers and mild, short winters. It is one of the hottest cities in summer on Earth. Average summer high temperatures are above 45 °C (113 °F) for three months of the year, and during heat waves; the daytime temperature regularly exceeds 50 °C (122 °F) with nighttime lows often remaining above 30 °C (86 °F). In winter, nighttime temperatures frequently drop below 8 °C (46 °F). Considering its coastal position and relative distance to the equator in comparison with the hot desert climates in Africa and Saudi Arabia, the heat in the city is rather extreme—being surrounded in almost every direction by the hot desert.
Sand storms occur at times during summer from the shamal wind.  Sand storms can occur any time of year but occur mostly during summer, and less frequently during autumn.

Economy
Kuwait has a petroleum-based economy, petroleum and fertilisers are the main export products. As of June 15, 2024 and according to Wise, the Kuwaiti dinar is the highest-valued currency unit in the world. Petroleum accounts for 43% of GDP and 70% of export earnings.

Transport
There are two airports in Kuwait. Kuwait International Airport serves as the principal hub for international air travel. State-owned Kuwait Airways is the largest airline in the country. A portion of the airport complex is designated as Al Mubarak Air Base, which contains the headquarters of the Kuwait Air Force, as well as the Kuwait Air Force Museum. In 2004, the first private airline of Kuwait, Jazeera Airways, was launched. In 2005, the second private airline, Wataniya Airways was founded.

Culture
Museum & Cultural Centre
Kuwait National Museum, Museum of Modern Art, Maritime Museum, Al Shaheed Park Museums, the Al Sabah Collection, Sadu House, Al Salam Palace, and the Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Cultural Centre are considered the most famous museums and cultural centres in Kuwait City.

Theatre
Kuwait is known for its home-grown tradition of theatre. Kuwait is the only Arab country in the Gulf region with a theatrical tradition. The Arabic theatrical movement in Kuwait constitutes a major part of the country's Arabic cultural life. Theatrical activities in Kuwait began in the 1920s when the first spoken dramas were released. Theatre activities are still popular today.

Soap operas
Kuwaiti soap operas (المسلسلات الكويتية) are among the most-watched soap operas in the Arab world. Most Gulf soap operas are based in Kuwait. Although usually performed in the Kuwaiti dialect, they are aired in the majority of Arabic-speaking countries and are highly popular.

Sports
The city is home to the Al Kuwait SC, which has traditionally provided Kuwait's national basketball team with key players.
From 13 to 15 February 2020 it held the first Aquabike World Championship Grand Prix of Kuwait.

Salmiya (Arabic: السالمية, romanized: As-Sālmīya(h)) is an area in Hawalli Governorate in Kuwait.
Salmiya is administratively divided into 12 blocks. The blocks located closer to the interior of the district tend to be mostly residential, while those located beside the Persian Gulf coastline have a great deal of commercial and up-scale residential real estate. The interior residential areas boast a huge population of foreigners consisting mainly of those from the Indian sub-continent and other Arabs who are not native to the Persian Gulf area. Approximately, two-thirds of the district's population reside in blocks 8 to 12. These blocks are highly desirable among the residents due to its urban amenities and the well-designed infrastructure, including the city's public works and built environment, enhances the overall quality of life for its residents.

Facilities
Salmiya hosts numerous museums, mosques, an aquarium, a Scientific Center, IMAX movie theaters, football stadium, medical centers, a Roman Catholic Chapel, the district passport office ("Jawazat") and a well-equipped park beside the 5th Ring Road. Notable malls include the Salmiya Souq Mega-mall which was the first mall in the nation, Marina Mall in the Marina World shopping and entertainment district, and the Omariya mall. The Gulf Road is coveted for its amazing sea vistas and is the main hub for new construction of future buildings and renovations. A boulevard passing through much of coastal Salmiya is a reflection of Kuwait's drive to modernity.
The Salem Al-Mubarak Street shopping district, commonly known as Salmiya Center, runs down the outer blocks of Salmiya. It is one of the oldest and largest shopping districts of Kuwait. It is a remnant of Kuwait's once numerous traditional souk bazaars, similar to the ones located in Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh and the centre Kuwait City. Well known in the past for pearls, gold and jewellery, it now consists of a wide array of retail giants and local outlets. Much of the old souk had been built over, but the feel and atmosphere of the past albeit remains visible at the traditional precincts of this shopping district. The experience varies from modernized (and Westernized) in the strip malls, to a true Kuwaiti experience on some of the back streets. It is notable to point out that the more eastward away from the capital one moves along the strip, the fancier and pricier the shops are in general. There are many gold and fabric shops in the "Old Souk" area located onwards from the intersection of the 4th Ring Road and the strip.

History
Salmiya has been a model district in the context of modernization. It has undertaken a major face lift in recent times primarily due to ever-expanding commercial real estate on the Gulf Road. The popular Salem Al-Mubarak Shopping strip is in relative close proximity to the capital. The boom in real estate in Salmiya has seen its demographics being constantly on the move. Increasing rental prices have gradually pushed out its working class expatriate community towards the interior districts of Kuwait.
The influx of foreigners to Salmiya is of historical importance dating as far back as the 1960s. During the Gulf War Salmiya was destroyed by invading Iraqi occupation, but from 1993 onward it was gradually rebuilt and re-populated. The old rugged 3-storied buildings and open fields, which Salmiya was famous for, have given way to high density layouts of high-rise apartments and complexes. The beach front, once a hub and harbor for the fishing and pearl diving community, has been transformed into a well-developed and modern bustling commercial avenue. Salmiya is also one of the most expensive area for real estate in the country.

Sport
Salmiya is home to the Thamir Stadium, which belongs to Al Salmiya Club.
Construction has begun on a cricket ground, which once completed will be of One Day International standard.  It is hoped the facility will help develop cricket in Kuwait, as well as luring international teams to play neutral matches there.  The ground is due for completion in 2012.

Transportation
Some of the major roads connecting Salmiya are the 4th Ring road, 5th Ring road, and the Gulf Road. There are 3 major bus operators, City Bus, Mowasalat and the Kuwait Public Transportation Company, serving all major routes along Salmiya. Taxis are widely available in Salmiya and one can expect to pre-bargain about the fare.

Developments
In 2010, Salmiya Park was proposed to a big park situated in the heart of Salmiyah. Boulevard Park is a massive park and mall in Salmiya which encompasses 353 thousand square meters including outstanding a shopping mall, restaurant village, train station & tunnel, cricket pavilion, and huge landscape including fountains, lakes, and several outdoor play grounds.
Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Cultural Centre includes six massive museums in one place inclusive of:

Space

Education
There are several educational institutions located in Salmiya. The American University of Kuwait which is only walking-distance from the heart of Salmiya Centre. Also nearby is the Gulf English School and The French School of Kuwait. The American International School of Kuwait is also located in Salmiya. There is a large number of schools catering to different nationalities. Notably among these are the Indian, Arab, and Pakistani schools present in the area serving their respective communities. The Pakistan School and College is the oldest school in Kuwait.

Al Jahra (Arabic: الجهراء) is a city and area located 32 kilometres (20 mi) west of the centre of Kuwait City in Kuwait. Al Jahra is the capital of the Al Jahra Governorate of Kuwait as well as the surrounding Al Jahra District which is agriculturally based. Encyclopædia Britannica recorded the population in 1980 as 67,311. Historically, Jahra was a predominantly agricultural area. There are currently various farms in Jahra.

Climate
Al Jahra has a hot desert climate and is one of the hottest places on earth. On 1 July 2021 a temperature of 53.5 °C was recorded.

History
Al Jahra was once largely dominated by agricultural land. Jahra was initially founded as a small oasis village. Jahra's most notable residents included Sheikh Thuwainy Bin Abdullah Al-Saadoun (Sheikh of Al-Muntafiq) in 1786, when he fled from Baghdad to Suleiman Pasha. He wanted to occupy Basra and Sheikh Abdullah Al-Sabah hosted him until he returned to Baghdad after he was pardoned by the Iraqi governor.
In 1925, Al Jahra administratively followed Kuwait City, and the population lived on the cultivation of palm trees and a little wheat and barley. Al Jahra contained 170 houses including the palace of Pasha al-Naqib and the palace of the Mubarak Al-Sabah.
Historically Jahra became known as a notable trading point and stopping place on the way to Kuwait City. It gradually grew into a town along the historic Kuwait Red Fort. Al Jahra was the site of the Battle of Jahra in 1920, a conflict between  Kuwaiti and  Saudi forces. Today, there is a national monument commemorating the battle. The conflict was settled in 1922 when King Abdul Aziz al-Saud recognized the independence of Kuwait in exchange for territory.

Gulf War
During the Gulf War, the outskirts of Al Jahra was also the site of an infamous shootout with the Allied destruction of a stalled Iraqi convoy as it retreated up Mutla Ridge on Highway 80 between 25 and 26 February 1991. The US Army received orders by General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. to not let anybody in or out of Kuwait City and to effectively blockade the retreating Iraqi convoys within a 100-mile (160-km) radius. He ordered the dispatching of Apache helicopters armed with anti-tank missiles to block the Iraqis. Schwarzkopf commented in 1995 on the military action:

Fires
A number of damaging fires have been known to have occurred in recent times in Al Jahra. On 25 August 2007, politician Massouma al-Mubarak was forced to resign from her post as health minister following a fire in a hospital which killed two patients.
On 15 August 2009 a fire broke out at a wedding in Al Jahra. At least 49 people were killed and about 80 others wounded when the grooms' wife, sought revenge for her husband's second marriage, poured petrol on a tent where women and children were celebrating and set it on fire. Within three minutes the whole tent was engulfed in flames, trapping many inside. It was the deadliest civilian disaster in Kuwait in the last 40 years.

Notable people
Mohammed Emwazi - 
(1988 – 2015), was a British militant of Kuwaiti origin seen in several videos produced by the Islamist extremist group Islamic State (IS) showing the beheadings of a number of captives in 2014 and 2015.

Transport
Al Jahra is located 32 kilometres (20 mi) north-west of Kuwait City and is connected by a series of ring roads. Highway 80 connects the town to Abdaly on the Iraqi border. The highway has become known as "The Highway of Death" due to its involvement in the Gulf War when the Allied troops destroyed an Iraqi convoy. The road was repaired during the late 1990s and was used in the initial stages of the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. and British forces. The surrounding area is desert but tents are often seen located along the highway. The nearest airport is at Kuwait International Airport.

Sport
The main football team is Al Jahra (football club). They play at the 25,000 capacity Al Shabab Mubarak Alaiar Stadium. They won the Kuwaiti Premier League once, in 1990. They participated in the Kuwaiti Premier League 21 times during the 2007-2008 season. Al Jahra has reached the Kuwait Emir Cup Final twice in 1996 and 2002 when they lost to Al Arabi 1-2 and Kuwait Club 0-1 respectively.
