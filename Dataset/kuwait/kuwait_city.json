      "content": "Kuwait City ( ; Arabic: مدينة الكويت, romanised: Madinat al-Kuwayt) is the capital and largest city of Kuwait. Located at the heart of the country on the south shore of Kuwait Bay on the Persian Gulf, it is the political, cultural and economic centre of the emirate, containing Kuwait's Seif Palace, government offices, and the headquarters of most Kuwaiti corporations and banks.\nAs of 2018, the metropolitan area had roughly three million inhabitants (more than 70% of the country's population). The city itself has no administrative status. All six governorates of the country comprise parts of the urban agglomeration, which is subdivided into numerous areas. In a narrower sense, Kuwait City can also refer only to the town's historic core, which nowadays is part of the Capital Governorate and seamlessly merges with the adjacent urban areas.\nKuwait City's trade and transportation needs are served by Kuwait International Airport, Mina Al-Shuwaik (Shuwaik Port) and Mina Al Ahmadi (Ahmadi Port).\n\nHistory\nIn the early to mid 1700s, Kuwait City was a small fishing village. Sometime in the mid 1700s, the Bani Utubs settled in Kuwait. At the time of the arrival of the Utubs, Kuwait was inhabited by a few fishermen. In the eighteenth century, Kuwait gradually became a principal commercial centre for the transit of goods between India, Muscat, Baghdad, Persia, and Arabia. By the late 1700s, Kuwait had already established itself as a trading route from the Persian Gulf to Aleppo.\nDuring the Persian siege of Basra in 1775–1779, Iraqi merchants took refuge in Kuwait and were partly instrumental in the expansion of Kuwait's boat-building and trading activities. As a result, Kuwait's maritime commerce boomed. Between the years 1775 and 1779, the Indian trade routes with Baghdad, Aleppo, Smyrna and Constantinople were diverted to Kuwait. The East India Company was diverted to Kuwait in 1792. The East India Company secured the sea routes between Kuwait, India and the east coasts of Africa. After the Persian  withdrawal  from Basra in 1779, Kuwait continued to attract trade away from Basra.\n\nKuwait was the centre of boat building in the Persian Gulf region. During the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, ship vessels made in Kuwait carried the bulk of trade between the ports of India, East Africa and the Red Sea. Kuwaiti ship vessels were renowned throughout the Indian Ocean. Regional geopolitical turbulence helped foster economic prosperity in Kuwait in the second half of the 18th century. Kuwait became prosperous due to Basra's instability in the late 18th century. At the time, Kuwait functioned partly as a haven for Basra's merchants fleeing Ottoman persecution. According to Palgrave, Kuwaitis developed a reputation as the best sailors in the Persian Gulf.\nDuring the reign of Mubarak Al-Sabah, Kuwait was dubbed the \"Marseille of the Gulf\" because its economic vitality attracted a large variety of people. In the first decades of the twentieth century, Kuwait had a well-established elite: wealthy trading families who were linked by marriage and shared economic interests.\nIn 1937, Freya Stark wrote about the extent of poverty in Kuwait at the time:\n\nPoverty has settled in Kuwait more heavily since my last visit five years ago, both by sea, where the pearl trade continues to decline, and by land, where the blockade established by Saudi Arabia now harms the merchants.\nSome prominent merchant families left Kuwait in the early 1930s due to the prevalence of economic hardship. At the time of the discovery of oil in 1937, most of Kuwait's inhabitants were impoverished.\nFrom 1946 to 1982, Kuwait experienced a period of prosperity driven by oil and its liberal atmosphere. In popular discourse, the years between 1946 and 1982 are referred to as the \"Golden Era\". In 1950, a major public-works programme began to enable Kuwaitis to enjoy a modern standard of living. By 1952, the country became the largest oil exporter in the Persian Gulf region. In the following year, the country's annual oil income grew to $169 million. This massive growth attracted many foreign workers, especially from Jordan, Egypt and India and helped finance the development of a new master plan, which the state approved in 1952. In June 1961, Kuwait became independent with the end of the British protectorate and the sheikh Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah became an Emir. Under the terms of the newly drafted constitution, Kuwait held its first parliamentary elections in 1963. Kuwait was the first Persian Gulf country to establish a constitution and parliament.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Kuwait was the most developed country in the region. Kuwait was the pioneer in the Middle East in diversifying its earnings away from oil exports. The Kuwait Investment Authority is the world's first sovereign wealth fund. From the 1970s onward, Kuwait scored highest of all Arab countries on the Human Development Index. Kuwait University was established in 1966. Kuwait's theatre industry was well-known throughout the Arab world. In the 1960s and 1970s, Kuwait's press was described as one of the freest in the world. Kuwait was the pioneer in the literary renaissance in the Arab region. In 1958, Al Arabi magazine was first published, the magazine went on to become the most popular magazine in the Arab world. Many Arab writers moved to Kuwait for freedom of expression because Kuwait had greater freedom of expression than elsewhere in the Arab world. Kuwait was a haven for writers and journalists from all parts of the Middle East, with the Iraqi poet Ahmed Matar leaving Iraq in the 1970s to take refuge in the more liberal environment of Kuwait.\nKuwaiti society embraced liberal and Western attitudes throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Most Kuwaiti women did not wear the hijab in the 1960s and 1970s. At Kuwait University, mini-skirts were more common than the hijab.\nIn the early 1980s, Kuwait experienced a major economic crisis after the Souk Al-Manakh stock market crash and decrease in oil price.\nThe Kuwait National Assembly Building, a parliament building designed by the works of Jørn Utzon in its elements of Islamic architecture, was completed in 1982 by orders of his son Jan Utzon.\nDuring the Iran–Iraq War, Kuwait supported Iraq. Throughout the 1980s, there were several terror attacks in Kuwait, including the 1983 Kuwait bombings, hijacking of several Kuwait Airways planes and attempted assassination of Emir Jaber in 1985. Kuwait was a leading regional hub of science and technology in the 1960s and 1970s up until the early 1980s, the scientific research sector significantly suffered due to the terror attacks.\n\nThe Kuwaiti government strongly advocated Islamism throughout the 1980s. At that time, the most serious threat to the continuity of Al Sabah came from home-grown secular democrats. The secular Kuwaiti opposition were protesting the 1976 suspension of the parliament. Al Sabah were attracted to Islamists preaching the virtues of a hierarchical order that included loyalty to the Kuwaiti monarchy. In 1981, the Kuwaiti government gerrymandered electoral districts in favour of the Islamists. Islamists were the government's main allies, hence Islamists were able to colonise state agencies, such as the government ministries. By the mid-1980s, Kuwait was described as an autocracy. In 1986, Emir Jaber suspended the parliament.\n\nAfter the Iran–Iraq War ended, Kuwait declined an Iraqi request to forgive its US$65 billion debt. An economic rivalry between the two countries ensued after Kuwait increased its oil production by 40 percent. Tensions between the two countries increased further in July 1990, after Iraq complained to OPEC claiming that Kuwait was stealing its oil from a field near the Iraq–Kuwait border by slant drilling of the Rumaila field.\nIn August 1990, Iraqi forces invaded and annexed Kuwait. After a series of failed diplomatic negotiations, the United States led a coalition to remove the Iraqi forces from Kuwait, in what became known as the Gulf War. On 26 February 1991, the coalition succeeded in driving out the Iraqi forces. As they retreated, Iraqi forces carried out a scorched earth policy by setting oil wells on fire. During the Iraqi occupation, more than 1,000 Kuwaiti civilians were killed. In addition, more than 600 Kuwaitis went missing during Iraq's occupation, approximately 375 remains were found in mass graves in Iraq.\nIn March 2003, Kuwait became the springboard for the US-led invasion of Iraq. Upon the death of the Emir Jaber, in January 2006, Saad Al-Sabah succeeded him but was removed nine days later by the Kuwaiti parliament due to his ailing health. Sabah Al-Sabah was sworn in as Emir.\n\nGeography\nKuwait City is located on Kuwait Bay, a natural deep-water harbor. Ninety percent of Kuwait's population live within the Kuwait Bay coast. The country is generally low-lying, with the highest point being 306 m (1,004 ft) above sea level. It has nine islands, all of which, with the exception of Failaka Island, are uninhabited. With an area of 860 km2 (330 sq mi), Bubiyan is the largest island in Kuwait and is connected to the rest of the country by a 2,380-metre-long (7,808 ft) bridge. The land area  is considered arable and sparse vegetation is found along its 499-kilometre-long (310 mi) coastline.\nKuwait's Burgan field has a total capacity of approximately 70 billion barrels (1.1×1010 m3) of proven oil reserves. During the 1991 Kuwaiti oil fires, more than 500 oil lakes were created covering a combined surface area of about 35.7 km2 (13.8 sq mi). The resulting soil contamination due to oil and soot accumulation had made eastern and south-eastern parts of Kuwait uninhabitable. Sand and oil residue had reduced large parts of the Kuwaiti desert to semi-asphalt surfaces. The oil spills during the Gulf War also drastically affected Kuwait's marine resources.\n\nClimate\nKuwait City has a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh) with extremely hot, very prolonged summers and mild, short winters. It is one of the hottest cities in summer on Earth. Average summer high temperatures are above 45 °C (113 °F) for three months of the year, and during heat waves; the daytime temperature regularly exceeds 50 °C (122 °F) with nighttime lows often remaining above 30 °C (86 °F). In winter, nighttime temperatures frequently drop below 8 °C (46 °F). Considering its coastal position and relative distance to the equator in comparison with the hot desert climates in Africa and Saudi Arabia, the heat in the city is rather extreme—being surrounded in almost every direction by the hot desert.\nSand storms occur at times during summer from the shamal wind.  Sand storms can occur any time of year but occur mostly during summer, and less frequently during autumn.\n\nEconomy\nKuwait has a petroleum-based economy, petroleum and fertilisers are the main export products. As of June 15, 2024 and according to Wise, the Kuwaiti dinar is the highest-valued currency unit in the world. Petroleum accounts for 43% of GDP and 70% of export earnings.\n\nTransport\nThere are two airports in Kuwait. Kuwait International Airport serves as the principal hub for international air travel. State-owned Kuwait Airways is the largest airline in the country. A portion of the airport complex is designated as Al Mubarak Air Base, which contains the headquarters of the Kuwait Air Force, as well as the Kuwait Air Force Museum. In 2004, the first private airline of Kuwait, Jazeera Airways, was launched. In 2005, the second private airline, Wataniya Airways was founded.\n\nCulture\nMuseum & Cultural Centre\nKuwait National Museum, Museum of Modern Art, Maritime Museum, Al Shaheed Park Museums, the Al Sabah Collection, Sadu House, Al Salam Palace, and the Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Cultural Centre are considered the most famous museums and cultural centres in Kuwait City.\n\nTheatre\nKuwait is known for its home-grown tradition of theatre. Kuwait is the only Arab country in the Gulf region with a theatrical tradition. The Arabic theatrical movement in Kuwait constitutes a major part of the country's Arabic cultural life. Theatrical activities in Kuwait began in the 1920s when the first spoken dramas were released. Theatre activities are still popular today.\n\nSoap operas\nKuwaiti soap operas (المسلسلات الكويتية) are among the most-watched soap operas in the Arab world. Most Gulf soap operas are based in Kuwait. Although usually performed in the Kuwaiti dialect, they are aired in the majority of Arabic-speaking countries and are highly popular.\n\nSports\nThe city is home to the Al Kuwait SC, which has traditionally provided Kuwait's national basketball team with key players.\nFrom 13 to 15 February 2020 it held the first Aquabike World Championship Grand Prix of Kuwait.\n\nNotable people\nAbdulhussain Abdulredha (1939–2017), Kuwaiti actor\nRania Al-Abdullah (born 1970 as Rania Al-Yassin), Kuwaiti-born queen consort of Jordan\nYasser Al-Masri (1970–2018), Kuwaiti-born Jordanian actor\nMishary Rashid Alafasy (born 1976), qāriʾ, imam, preacher and nasheed singer\nAdline Castelino (born 1998), model, represented India in the Miss Universe 2020 pageant\nDiana Karazon (born 1983), Kuwaiti-born Jordanian singer\nSaleem Haddad (born 1983), Kuwaiti author and aid worker\nOmar Jarun (born 1983), former footballer and currently an assistant coach for Atlanta United 2\nAbdulfattah Owainat (born 1972), Kuwaiti-born Palestinian singer and songwriter\n\nSee also\nList of twin towns and sister cities of Kuwait\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n Kuwait City travel guide from Wikivoyage\nWahab, Robert Alexander (1911). \"Kuwēt\" .

وبها المطار الدولي المتطور الذي يربطها بمختلف عواصم العالم، فيتم تلبيه احتياجات التجاره والنقل في مدينه الكويت من خلالها وميناء الشويخ وميناء الاحمدي.\nالكويت هي عاصمه ناشئه متطوره عرفت الازدهار مند ان اكتشف النفط سنه 1934، وتشهد نهضه عمرانيه شامله وحدائق كبيره ومتنزهات كحديقه الشهيد وبيت التمويل ومصارف وشركات تامين وجامعات ومعاهد، واهمها جامعه الكويت، التي تضم مختلف الاقسام والفروع والتخصصات.

معالم الكويت خزانات المياه المعلقه، وتعرف بالابراج، وهي مبنيه على تصميم سوني ليندستورم. وقد استخدم في هذه الابراج خمسون طنًا من الالمنيوم المفرغ. تم بنائها في عام 1975 وافتتحت رسميًا في 1 مارس 1979. تعتبر مدينه الكويت مركزًا للثقافه العربيه الحديثه في الخليج حيث اختيرت عاصمه للثقافه الاسلاميه للعام 2016، ومركزًا ثقافيًا وطنيًا وفيها منطقه الثقافيه الوطنيه ومتحف الوطني، وهو غني بالتحف والاثار. كما يوجد بها مركز الطب الاسلامي ويتميز بعمارته الخاصه.\nومن ابرز معالم الكويت التاريخيه اسواقها القديمه، واهمها سوق المباركيه، والصفاه، والحريم. وفي الكويت عدد من المساجد الحديثه والاثريه واهمها مسجد الدوله الكبير الذي تم بناؤه 1986.\n\nالتسميه\nاسم مدينه الكويت هو مشترك لفظي مع اسم الدوله التي هي عاصمتها. كانت بلده الكويت تدعى القُرَيْن في القرن الثامن عشر، وهو تصغير من قرن وكوت. والقرن هو التل او الارض العاليه، والكوت هو القلعه او الحص. وهناك عده مواضع تسمى بالقرين على الساحل الشرقي لجزيره العربيه، الى الجنوب من الكويت، وعديد من البلدان العربيه المسماه بالكوت. وجمع الكوت اكوات، ويطلق مؤرخو الجزيره العربيه هذه التسميه على الحصون المتعدده في المدن ذات القلاع والاسوار. ومن المرحج ان براك شيخ بني خالد، انشا بلده الكويت قريبا للقرين، وغلب اسم الكويت على الموضع. فصارت البلده تعرف باسم الكويت بدلًا من القرين. تقول الروايه المحليه الكويتيه ان براكًا، قد بنى الكويت قبل بدايه القرن الثامن عشر م/ الثاني عشر هـ، وبراك بن غرير ال حميد تولى زعامه بني خالد ما بين عام 1669 - 1682 م. هناك منطقه بمحافظه مبارك الكبير في دوله الكويت سميت القرين المشهوره بسوقها فليست هي القرين التاريخيه.\nتسمي مدينه الكويت في اللهجه الكويتيه بـالديره.\n\nالتاريخ\nينطبق على الكويت مصطلح دوله مدينه، فتاريخ مدينتها متعلقه بامارتها وعاده حسبها المؤرخون جزء من تاريخ البلاد عمومًا ولم يفردوا بدراستها، اذ كانت المدينه القديمه داخل السور هي محور ارتكازها بالمقارنه مع القرى الساحليه والواحات التابعه لها التي لم يكن اسوار. وقد ظهرت بلده الكويت كمستوطن بشري في القرن الثامن عشر، وقد تكون ذلك التجمع من خلال الهجرات السكانيه من شبه الجزيره العربيه اساسًا والمناطق الاخرى. اضافه الى وجود بعض التجمعات الصغيره التي كانت مستقره على ساحل الخليج بما يعرف بالكوت قديمًا.\nارتبطت الحياه بصوره مباشره بالبحر كالمصدر اساسي للدخل عن طريق الصيد وتجاره اللؤلؤ. اتسم العمران السائده للمدينه بما تتسم به المدن العربيه الاسلاميه القديمه، والتي تتميز بوجود المباني والمتلاصقه والطرقات المتعرجه الضيقه والاسوار العاليه التي تظلل الطرقات، والبيوت ذا الطابق الوحد مع ارتفاع الجدارن المجاوره، للوقايه من حراره طوال النهار. كانت المساكن ملائمه للظروف الطبيعيه والاجتماعيه والاقتصاديه. شهدت البلده حوالي ثلاثه اسوار كل سور يتسع نطاقه مع اتساع البلده وكان اخرها السور الذي انشئ عام 1919 وعرف بسور الكويت ويحتوى على خمس بوابات. في عام 1946 خرجت اول شحنه نفطيه من موانيها، ومنذ ذلك التاريخ بدا النفط يلعب دورًا اساسيًا في الحياه الاقتصاديه والاجتماعيه والعمرانيه فتطورت بلده الكويت واتصلت تاريخها بتاريخ النفط في الكويت.\n\nبداياتها\nاختلف الاراء حول ظهور مدينه الكويت او تاسيسها، فمن المؤرخين من يظن انه عام 1613، ومنهم من يذكر ان تاريخ تاسيسها كان عام 1672، بينما يؤكد اخرون انه كان في عام 1713. ويرى البعض انها انشئت ما بين 1670 و 1712. على ما يبدو، فان الكويت كانت موجوده منذ القرن السابع عشر، وكانت معروفه منذ اوائل القرن السابع عشر في خرائط اوروبيه، كما تقرره وثائق شركه الهند الشرقيه. وقد ارتبطت بداياتها مع بلده القرين، ثم غلب عليها اسم الكويت.\nكانت في القرن السابع عشر قريه صغيره، سكنها جماعه من البدو وصيادي السمك وبعض العشائر التابعه لابن عريعر، الا انها سرعان ما بدات تنمو تدريجيًا، حتى اصبحت مركزًا للقبائل التي تحيب بها ومكانًا لبناء القوارب فيما بعد. فان براك بن عريعر قد اصدر امره بانشاء قصر كبير، كوت، في موقع مدينه الكويت الحاليه، ليتخذه مركزًا لقواته المحافظه على الحدود. كانت للكويت صله قويه مع بنو خالد في الاحساء. بنو خالد، وهم من قبائل العربيه الكبيره في الاحساء، وحكامها من شيوخ بني عريعر، كانوا على علاقه طيبه مع العثمانيين، واستمر حكمهم حتى عام 1670. العلاقه بينهم وبين الكويت قامت ومنذ البدايه على التعاون حتى قبل استقرار قبائل العتوب في الكويت، واشتركوا مع بني خالد في فتح القطيف سنه 1671. وحين ظهرت الدعوه السلفيه الوهابيه في نجد، قام صراع عنيف بين ال سعود وال عريعر زعماء بني خالد، انتهى بتغلب السعوديين فاخضعوا الاحساء لحكمهم في 1793. ثم اتاحت الفرصه امام بعض التجمعات العشائريه التابعه للخوالد كالعتوب لكي تنفرد بحكم المناطق التي سبق وان تمركزت فيها، مثل الكويت. والعتوب، يمثلون حلفًا يضم افخاذًا كثيره تنتمي لعده قبائل، هاجرت من مساكنها في نجد واستقرت على سواحل الخليج وتحالفت هذه القبائل مع بعضها واصبحت تمثل قبيله العتوب الواحده. تمت هجره العتوب بالعقد 1670-1680 م. فسكنت الكويت - القرين - جماعات العتوب وهم ال صباح وال خليفه والجلاهمه اضافه الى اسر عديده وقبائل اخرى منها المطير وعجمان، وقد احاط بهذه الجماعات التي سكنت بالقرب من الساحل مجموعات اخرى من شبه الرحل من البدو. استطاع العتوب تثبيت اوضاعهم الجديده بتحالفهم مع القبائل المجاوره لهم، وكان لنزعه هذه القبائل الى الاستقلال، وضعف السلطه العثمانيه في ولايه البصره، ورغبه الوكالات التجاريه الاوربيه على التعامل مباشره مع شيوخ العتوب، ساعد المجتمع الجديد ان يشهد نموًا اقتصاديًا في القرن الثامن عشر، لا سيما في الفتره 1716- 1766.\n\nالقرن 18\nفي سنه 1709 مر بالكويت مرتضى بن علوان في طريقه الى الحج وكتب عنها في رحلتها وقال: «دخلنا بلده يقال لها الكويت بالتصغير. بلده لا باس بها تشابه الحسا بابراجها ومبانيها.. واما الفاكهه والبطيخ وغير ذلك من اللوازم فياتي من البصره كل يوم في المركب، وتاتيها الحبوب من الحنطه وغيرها، لان ارضها لا تقبل الزراعه، واسعارها ارخص من الحسا.» \nنجح العتوب في تنميه بلدتهم وتعزيز امكاناتها، اولها خطوط المواصلات البحريه للشركات التجاريه الاوروبيه عبر الخليج العربي واليه، وثانيهما عدم وجود قوه قادره على منافستهم بالمنطقه، كذلك سماحه حكم بني خالد الذي ساعد في توفير الحمايه لهم، وفتح لهم نوافذ التعامل السياسي والتجاري مع الاخرين، مما عزز مدينتهم الناشئه وثبت اركانها، التي اشتهرت بالكويت بدلًا من القرين. وفي النصف الاول من القرن الثامن عشر، استفادت الكويت في تدعيم مكانتها المتناميه.\nزادت اهميه الكويت كمركز تجاري بارز في المنطقه بعد الاحتلال الزندي لولايه البصره العثماني في 1775 خلال الحرب العثمانيه الفارسيه. كانت البصره في ذلك الوقت مركزًا تجاريًا مهمًا، وترتب على احتلالها ان انتقلت الحركه التجاريه الخارجيه الى الكويت حيث نقلت شركه الهند الشرقيه مكاتبها ومخازنها وموظفيها وسفنها اليها. فاصبحت الكويت سوق تلك المنطقه وبدات الهجره الضخمه اليها باعتبارها مركزًا تجاريًا نشطًا جديدًا في منطقه الخليج العربي.\nبحكم موقعها الجغرافي باعتبارها مركزًا للقوافل البريه المتجهه نحو البصره وحلب، قد ترتب على ذلك ازدياد تعاملها التجاري مع البصره، بعد رجوعها الى العثمانيين. كما اشتهرت بكونها المنفذ الطبيعي لمناطق شبه الجزيره العربيه، وادت دور الوسيط التجاري بين العراق وشرق الجزيره العربيه، اقليم الاحساء.\nمع بدايه النصف الثاني من القرن الثامن عشر، اصبح للكويت طرق خاص بها وتمعتت بمكانه بارزه بين امارات الخليج العربي، حيث كان اسطولها التجاري ثاني اسطول بعد مسقط. وبصفه عامه، افادت الكويت مدينتًا وامارتًا من المساهمه الكثيره في التجاره شركه الهند الشرقيه الهولنديه، واكبر فائده من التعامل مع شركه الهند الشرقيه البريطانيه ايضًا.\nتمثل سنوات اخيره للقرن 18، وبدايه 19 باحداثها المهمه، فتره انشغال اهالي الكويت في توطيد انفسهم وتقويه نفوذهم، اذ نجح ال الصباح في زياده قوتهم عن طريق التزاوج والمصاهره مع القبائل الاخرى، كما شهد المجتمع الجديد تطورًا ملحوظًا، اذ تطور سكان المدينه الكويت الى مجتمع مستقر يشتغل بالتجاره والغوص على الؤلؤ وصناعه السفن والقوارب، فضلًا عن وجود ملامح التوجه نحو العلم والمعرفه.\nتولي الحكم عبد الله بن صباح حوالي عام 1762، وخلال حكمه نمت الكويت وازدهرت واتسعت مدينه الكويت واستقرت اوضاعها الداخليه، وبني سور المدينه التي عرفت بسور الكويت. وبلغ طوله 750 متر، وهو اول سور عرفته الكويت. ولم يبقى من المباني التي كانت بداخل السور سوى 4 مساجد وهي: مسجد السوق الكبير ومسجد الخليفه ومسجد العدساني ومسجد الحداد وكان السور يحتوي على خمسه بوابات، وقيل ست بوابات. انذاك كانت مدينه الكويت في السابق عباره عن مدينه صغيره جدًا، يحيطها سور يعرف باسم السور الاول. وهي ما عرفت فيما بعد باسم الوسط بعد التوسع الذي صار خارج السور الاول.\nفي الربع الاخير من القرن، كانت الكويت قد استكملت المقومات الاساسيه لوجودها المتنامي، وبرز اسم شيخها الحاكم محليًا وخليجيًا. فان البدايه الحقيقيه لنشاه الكويت، كانت في عهدها وهو الذي تمكن من وضع نواتها الاولى، وثبت موقعها السياسي. توفي عبد الله في عام 1814 وترك من الاولاد ولدًا واحدًا هو جابر، الذي تولى الامر بعده.\n\nالقرن 19\nاكملت في عهد جابر السور الذي بناه والده، ويبدو ان ذلك السور قد تهدمت اجزاء عديده منه، ومن ثم امر الشيخ جابر ببناء سور اخر عام 1814، على ان اجزاء من هذا السور تهدمت كذلك، فعمل على تعيمه عام 1841. خلال هذه الفره نمت مدينه الكويت واتسعت تجارتها. فقد وصف جيمس سلك بكنغهام الكويت خلال رحلته في الخليج عام 1816 بقوله «وكان الميناء الذي يلي القطيف على هذا الساحل، هو ميناء قرين كما يسمي في الخرائط الانجليزيه، ويتميز الميناء بجوده مرفاه، وكان يستعمل لفتره من فترات كمحطه لسفن شركه الهند الشرقيه لترسو فيه، ويقطن المدينه بصوره رئيسيه التجار والمشتغلين بالتجاره.»\nحققت الكويت زياده ملحوظه في عدد سكانها في الربع الاول من القرن التاسع عشر، ولكنها اصيبت بطاعون في عام 1826، لا يقل فداحه عما حدث في العراق ونجد، فالمصادر تجمع على ان هذا الطاعون افنى اكثر من ثلاثه اربع اهل الكويت. وصفه يواكيم هايوارد ستوكويلر عام 1831 «كنت تقريبًا الاوروبي الوحيد الذي زار المدينه خلال عده سنوات، واحتوت على ما يقارب  الاف نسمه، وان المدينه كان يحكمها انذاك شيخ لم يحتفظ بقوه مسلحه، ولكنه كان يجبي اثنين في المائه ضريبه على كل الواردات.» فان اهميه الكويت قد تدنت في اواخر الثلث الاول من القرن التاسع عشر، اذ تناقض سكانها الى اربعه الاف نسمه. وبعد مده وجيزه، سرعان ما عم البلاد الاستقرار.\nمع حلول النصف الثاني من القرن، اخذت الكويت تستعيد اهميتها الخليجيه والدوليه. وخلال ستينات القرن، تقدمت الكويت وكثر عمرانها وتزايد سكانها واحتلت الصداره بين الامارات المتواجده في الشمال الخليج العربي، فاصبحت «مدينه مزدهره، وهي تضم حوالي 20 الف نسمه.» \nشهدت سبعينات القرن التاسع عشر، اشتداد التنافس الاوروبي للسيطره على مناطق النفوذ في الشرق الاوسط، مما اكسب الخليج العربي اهميه خاصتًا بعد فتح قناه السويس عام 1869، فكثر الكلام عن مشروع سكه حديديه تربط الاسماعيليه على قنان السويس بالكويت على الخليج العربي.\nوفي سبعينات القرن التاسع عشر، ازداد عدد السفن الكويتيه وتصاعدت فعاليتها التجاريه، مع استقرار اوضاعها السياسيه، وثبوت سيادتها على نفسها، حتى قدرتها جريده الزوراء العراقيه بالفي سفينه في عددها 17 بتاريخ 3 يونيو 1871، فزادت اهميه ميناء الكويت.\n\nالقرن 20\nتقدمت الكويت في عهد مبارك الصباح، وازدهرت التجاره اذ توفرت وسائلها. والكويت كانت تتمتع بميناء بحري ممتاز، وتملك اسطولًا تجاريًا عظيمًا في هذه الفتره، واستمرت تجارتها التقلديه مع الهند وشرق افريقيا والعراق، ومما زاد في نشاطها التجاري عوده السفن التجاريه الانجليزيه في رحلتها الاسبوعيه المعتاده، والتي كانت تقوم فيها بزياره الكويت وهي عائده من بلاد الهند. في البحار، كانت سفن الكويت الشراعيه تواصل رحلاتها الى دول عديده في شبه القاره الهنديه وشرقي افريقيا ووصل بعضها الى موزمبيق جنوبًا، وبلغ عدد سفن الغوص في 1922 ثمانمائه سفينه.\nتم تشييد سور الكويت الثالث في 1920، الذي يبلغ طول السور 7 كيلومترات ويمتد حول مدينه الكويت بارتفاع قدره 4 امتار وسمك 3 امتار ويتكون من اربع بوابات واضيفت بوابه خامسه لاحقا. بعد هدم السور الثالث في سنه 1957 ظلت تعرف تلك المنطقه التي كانت داخل السور باسم مدينه الكويت واصبحت تعرف الاحياء باسم مناطق، واصبحت فيما بعد هي العاصمه الرسميه لدوله الكويت.\nشهدت الكويت في عهد مبارك تنميه العصريه والحداثه، منها خدمات البريديه والتلغراف اللاسكلي، والطبيه، والتعليميه. في 1927، تم انشاء اول مطار في الكويت، وفي 1942 افتتح اول بنك فيها، وفي 1945 انشئ بيت الكويت في القاهره للاشراف على البعثات الكويتيه التي بدات اعدادها في الازياد هناك، اصدرت اول شحنه من نفط الكويت خام في 1946، وتاسست اول مطبعه في الكويت سنه 1947، وفي السنه التي تلتها صدرت مجله كاظمه وهي اول مجله تطبع وتصدر من الكويت.\n\nوفي عهد جابر المبارك الصباح، ازدهرت التجاره مع بلاد الشام. وفي عهد سالم، خطط للدفاع عن مدينه الكويت نفسها بناء سور جديد لحمايتها وتم بناء ذلك السور في شهرين، وبقي قائما حتى 1957، لتتسع المدينه خارج السور ولم يبق منه سوى بواباته. وفي عام 1938 شهدت الكويت حدثين هامين في تاريخها في عهد احمد الجابر الصباح، اولهما ما عرف بحركه مجلس، وثانيهما اكتشاف النفط بكميات تجاريه، وتصادف وقوع هذين الحادثين مع بدايه الحرب العالميه الثانيه. لم تستفد الكويت مبكرًا من نفطها بالنظر لاندلاع الحرب التي استمرت قائمه حتى عام 1942. الا ان عائدات النفط اخذت تتدفق على الكويت بعد ان احتفلت باساله النفط وبدايه تصديره في 30 يونيو 1946. فبدا وجه الكويت في التغير السريع، واستغل احمد الجابر هذه الثروه في بناء نهضه البلاد التعليميه والصحيه.\nفبعد ظهور نفط وتصدير اول شحنه عام 1946 مرت المدينه بطفره عمرانيه ادت الى التوسع العمراني، ثم هدم السور المحيط بها في سنه 1957 للتوسع. \nفي 19 يونيو 1961، اصبحت الكويت دوله مستقله وعيّت مدينه الكويت عاصمتًا لها بدون ماده مخصصه او ذكرها في الدستور الكويتي. \nلحقت بالمدينه العديد من الاضرار في البنايات والاماكن العامه والجمعيات ومراكز التسوق والبيوت والمستوصفات وارشيف الكويت الوطني بعد الاجتياح العراقي للكويت عام 1990، وتم اعاده ترميم الاضرار بعد التحرير.\nهناك بعض انتقادات من صحفيون حول تلوث بصري وسوء التخطيط العمراني في مدينه الكويت لا سيما بعد الستينات القرن العشرين.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع مدينه الكويت على جون الكويت، وهو ميناء طبيعي ذو مياه عميقه ويعيش 90٪ من سكان الكويت داخل ساحله.\nانشئت الارصاد الجويه في الكويت في يوليو 1953 حيث ضمن محطه مناخيه واحده في الشويخ على اساس رصدتين، وفي عام 1954 اقيمت محطتان مناخيتان الاولى في مدينه الكويت بمدرسه ابو بكر الصديق والثانيه في العمريه. وفي 1955 انشئت محطه مناخيه في مطار الكويت القديم، النزهه لاحقًا، حيث كانت الرصدات تؤخد يوميًا الساعه التاسعه صباحًا او حسب متطلبات الطيران. في 1956 اقيمت محطه ارصاد تجريبيه في موقع المطار الجديد، مطار الكويت الدولي حاليًا، وقبيل انتهاء عام 1957 اقيمت محطه مناخيه في موقع المطار نفسها، وفي عام 1951 بدات اذاعه الكويت نشرتها الجويه، وخلال عام 1960 نشرت تقارير المناخ السنويه لاول مره للاعوام 1956- 1960. في مطلع عام 1962 بدات اول محطه سينوبتيكيه في العمل في مطار الدولي، على اساس 24 ساعه. فتطورت بعدها تقنيات الارصاد الجوي في فترات متعدده.\n\nالمناخ\nتتمتع مدينه الكويت بمناخ صحراوي حار (كوبن: BWh) مع فصول الصيف شديده الحراره وطويله الامد وشتاء معتدل وقصير. انها من اكثر المدن حراره على وجه الارض. يزيد متوسط درجات الحراره المرتفعه في الصيف عن 45 درجه مئويه (113 درجه فهرنهايت) لمده ثلاثه اشهر من العام، واثناء موجات الحر تتجاوز درجه الحراره خلال النهار بانتظام 50 درجه مئويه (122 درجه فهرنهايت) مع ادنى مستوياتها في الليل تظل اعلى من 30 درجه مئويه (86 درجه فهرنهايت). في فصل الشتاء، تنخفض درجات الحراره ليلا غالبًا الى اقل من 8 درجات مئويه (46 درجه فهرنهايت). بالنظر الى موقعها الساحلي والمسافه النسبيه لخط الاستواء بالمقارنه مع المناخ الصحراوي الحار في افريقيا والمملكه العربيه السعوديه، فان الحراره في المدينه شديده الى حد ما - حيث تحيط بها الصحراء الساخنه في كل اتجاه تقريبًا.\nتحدث العواصف الرمليه في بعض الاحيان خلال فصل الصيف من رياح الشمال. يمكن ان تحدث العواصف الرمليه في اي وقت من العام ولكنها تحدث غالبًا خلال فصل الصيف واقل تكرارًا خلال فصل الخريف.\n\nالاداره\nتاسست بلديه الكويت في 13 ابريل 1930 بعد ان قام يوسف بن عيسى القناعي بزياره الى مملكه البحرين في يوليو 1928، حيث شاهد بلديتها التي انشئت في عام 1919 وبعد ذلك كتب مقاله بعنوان الحكم الشرعي في تاريخ البلديات فطرحت فكره انشاء البلديه على حاكم الكويت احمد الجابر الصباح الذي اقتنع بالفكره ووافقه على انشاء بلديه الكويت. بعد عام من تاسيسها صدر قانون البلديه حيث نصت مادته الاولى بان يتالف المجلس البلدي من اثنى عشر عضوًا ورئيسًا.\nتتمتع بلديه الكويت منذ نشاتها بشخصيه مستقله. لها انظمتها وقوانينها الخاصه. كان المجلس البلدي يقوم بدور التخطيط والتوجيه والرقابه ، ومدير البلديه والجهاز التنفيذي ينجزان الاعمال وينفذانها. اهتمت البلديه بالتنظيف والمراقبه وتحصيل الرسوم. كان مقرها في مكتب صغير داخل متجر مستاجر في السوق. في عام 1933 انتقلت البلديه الى مقرها الرئيسي في ساحه الصفاه.\nفي مبنى البلديه القديم استمر العمل بقانون البلديه حتى عام 1954، حيث صدر قانون جديد نصت الماده الاولى «ان يكون للبلديه شخصيه حكيمه ذات استقلال مالي تعمل على تقدم المدينه عمرانيا وصحيا واجتماعيا ومدنيا ليمارس المجلس البلدي سلطه الاشراف والتوجيه .». اما السلطه التنفيذيه فيتم ممارستها من قبل رئيس البلديه وبمساعده مدير البلديه. يتكون الجهاز التنفيذي من ادارات الشؤون الاداريه والماليه والفنيه والصحيه. بنهايه الخمسينيات تم تشكيل مجلس اعلى في الدوله ضم رؤساء الدوائر الحكوميه في الكويت وبعض خبراء. في هذه المرحله تم وضع قوانين منها قانون البلديه لعام 1960، حيث نصت الماده الثانيه منه: «ان تعمل البلديه على تقدم الكويت عمرانيا وصحيا عن طريق تنظيم المدينه وتجميلها ووقايه الصحه العامه وتامين سلامه المواد الغذائيه والمحافظه على الراحه العامه في المساكن والطرقات واتخاذ ما يؤدي الى تقدم الكويت ورفاهيه سكانها.»\nاحمد المنفوحي هو مدير عام البلديه منذ 18 يناير 2016،  جدد تعيينه لمده اربع سنوات في 24 يناير 2020.\nوللوزراه العدل هناك اداره تنفيذ محافظه العاصمه.\n\nالتركيبه السكانيه\nالدين\nاغلب سكان

الكويت كبغداد وبيروت يظهر في تقسمه الى مذهبين السنّه والشيعه. تركز وجود الشيعه بالكويت في المدينه اساسًا، والاثني عشريه الاصوليه في صدر التركيبه المذهبيه المَدرسيه عندهم ثم الاخباريه والشيخيه. ويتوزعون بين تيارات عديده علمانيه ودينيه.\nمنحت الحكومه للمسيحين قطعه ارض كبيره في حي من اعظم احياء العاصمه لاقامه كنيسه عليها، تعرف بكنيسه العائله المقدسه وهي كاتدرائيه رومانيه كاثوليكيه افتتحت في 16 مارس 1961. وهناك ايضًا الكنيسه الانجيليه.\n\nالاقتصاد\nتتميز مدينه الكويت بكونها ميناء الرئيسي للدوله، مما يزيد من اهميتها على المستوى التجاري، ويحتوي ايضا على مطار دولي، مما يجعلها تتميز النشاط البحري والجوي. بالنسبه للانتاج الصناعي، ينتج عدد كبير من المنتجات في الكويت، وخاصه السلع الاساسيه لصناعه النفط. كما تنشط الحياه الماليه لوجود عدد من البنوك ومؤسسات التامين وذلك بسبب انها تعتبر ثاني اكبر الاسواق الماليه بين دول الخليج العربي. في عام 1952 افتتح اول بنك في الكويت، وهو فرع من البنك الشاهي البريطاني المؤسس في لندن عام 1882 وكان يقع في السوق الداخلي ثم نقل من مكانه الى مكان بني خصيصا له في ساحه الصفاه. تاسس بنك الكويت الوطني في 1952 هو اول واعرق مؤسسه ماليه ومصرفيه في دوله الكويت. ثم تاسس بنك الكويت المركزي بموجب القانون رقم 32 لسنه 1968 في شان النقد وبنك الكويت المركزي وتنظيم

اقيمت في وسط المدينه واستمرت في اداء دورها لفترات طويله قبل ان تتحول الى مكتبه عامه يشرف عليها المجلس الوطني للثقافه والفنون والاداب. ساعدت مساحه الكويت الصغيره وكذلك تعداد سكانه والامكانيات الضخمه المتاحه لها على تسهيل التعليم. بناء المدارس من ابرز مظاهر النهضه العمرانيه الكويتيه في خمسينيات القرن العشرين اذ بنيت خلالها عشرات المدارس وفي مقدمتها ثانويه الشويخ ومدرسه صلاح الدين المتوسطه 1952
