Located opposite the Grand Mosque, one of Seif Palace's best-known features is the watch tower, covered in blue tiles and with a roof plated in pure gold. Local materials such as clay, rocks, limestone, wood and metals were used in its construction.\n\nOverview\nThe tower of the Seif Palace received a direct hit from an incoming missile during the first Gulf War (1990–91), which destroyed the dial room. British clockmaker Smith of Derby Group replaced the iconic clock, and were the only non-US company to be awarded a contract in this reconstructive period.\n\nSee also\nAmiri Diwan of Kuwait\nTimeline of Kuwait City\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Seif palace at Wikimedia Commons",
