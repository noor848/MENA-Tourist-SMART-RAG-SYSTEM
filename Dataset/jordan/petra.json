      "content": "Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء‎, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα, lit. 'Rock'), originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu (Nabataean Aramaic: 𐢛𐢚𐢒‎ or 𐢛𐢚𐢓𐢈‎, *Raqēmō), is an ancient city and archaeological site in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also called the \"Rose City\" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved. The city is one of the New 7 Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and was settled by the Nabataeans, a nomadic Arab people, in the 4th century BC. Petra would later become the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom in the second century BC. The Nabataeans invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub, which gained them considerable revenue. Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and thus were able to defend their kingdom. They were particularly skillful in agriculture, stone carving, and rainwater harvesting.\nPetra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants. Nabataea fell to the Romans in 106 AD, who annexed and renamed it Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.\nUNESCO has described Petra as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\". Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Visitor numbers reach close to a million tourists every year.\n\nHistory\nNeolithic\nBy 7000 BC, some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in Beidha, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement just north of Petra.\n\nBronze Age\nPetra is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and the Amarna letters as Pel, Sela, or Seir.\n\nIron Age Edom\nThe Iron Age lasted between 1200 and 600 BC; in that time, the Petra area was occupied by the Edomites. The configuration of mountains in Petra allowed for a reservoir of water for the Edomites. This made Petra a stopping point for merchants, making it an outstanding area for trade. Some wares that were traded included wines, olive oil, and wood.\nInitially, the Edomites were accompanied by Nomads who eventually left, but the Edomites stayed and made their mark on Petra before the emergence of the Nabataens. It is said that 10,000 men were thrown off of the mountain Umm el-Biyara, but this story has been debated by scholars.\nThe Edomite site excavated at the top of the Umm el-Biyara mountain at Petra was established no earlier than the seventh century BC (Iron II).\n\nEmergence of Petra\nThe Nabataeans were one among several nomadic Bedouin tribes that roamed the Arabian Desert and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water. Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, theories about them having Aramean roots are rejected by many modern scholars. Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern Arabian tribe. Current evidence suggests that the Nabataean name for Petra was Raqēmō, variously spelled in inscriptions as rqmw or rqm.\nThe Jewish historian Josephus (ca. 37–100 AD) writes that the region was inhabited by the Midianites during the time of Moses, and that they were ruled by five kings, one of whom was Rekem. Josephus mentions that the city, called Petra by the Greeks, \"ranks highest in the land of the Arabs\" and was still called Rekeme by all the Arabs of his time, after its royal founder (Antiquities iv. 7, 1; 4, 7). The Onomasticon of Eusebius also identified Rekem as Petra. Arabic raqama means \"to mark, to decorate\", so Rekeme could be a Nabataean word referring to the famous carved rock façades. In 1964, workmen clearing rubble away from the cliff at the entrance to the gorge found several funerary inscriptions in Nabatean script. One of them was to a certain Petraios who was born in Raqmu (Rekem) and buried in Garshu (Jerash).\n\nAn old theory held that Petra might be identified with a place called sela in the Hebrew Bible. Encyclopædia Britannica (1911) states that the Semitic name of the city, if not Sela, would remain unknown. It nevertheless cautioned that sela simply means \"rock\" in Hebrew, and thence might not be identified with a city where it occurs in the biblical text in the book of Obadiah. It is possible that the city was part of the nation of Edom.\nThe passage in Diodorus Siculus (xix. 94–97) described the Nabataeans at the time as a nomadic group of people who believed that those who owned possessions could be easily compelled by those who held power, this would drastically change as the centuries went on.\nThis text further describes the expeditions which Antigonus sent against the Nabataeans in 312 BC, was understood by some researchers to throw some light upon the history of Petra, but the \"petra\" (Greek for rock) referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper name, and the description implies that there was no town in existence there at the time.\n\nRoman period\nIn 106, when Aulus Cornelius Palma Frontonianus was governor of Roman Syria, the part of the Arabian Peninsula under the rule of Petra was absorbed into the Roman Empire as part of Arabia Petraea, and Petra became its capital. The native dynasty came to an end but the city continued to flourish under Roman rule. It was around this time that the Petra Roman Road was built. A century later, in the time of Severus Alexander, when the city was at the height of its splendor, the issue of coinage came to an end. There was no more building of sumptuous tombs, owing apparently to some sudden catastrophe, such as an invasion by the Sasanian Empire.\nMeanwhile, as Palmyra (fl. 130–270) grew in importance and attracted the pre-Islamic Arab trade away from Petra, the latter declined. It appears, however, to have lingered on as a religious center. Another Roman road was constructed at the site. Epiphanius of Salamis (c.315–403) writes that in his time a feast was held there on December 25 in honor of the virgin Khaabou and her offspring Dushara. Dushara and al-Uzza were two of the principal deities of the city, which otherwise included many idols from other Nabataean deities such as Allat and Manat.\nBetween 111 and 114, Trajan built the Via Traiana Nova, running from the Syrian border to the Red Sea through Petra. This road followed the old routes of Nabataean caravans. In the shadow of the Pax Romana, this route revived trade between Arabia, Syria, and Mediterranean harbors. In 125 AD, one of Emperor Hadrian's administrators left marks in Petra, pointed out by documents found at the Dead Sea. In 130, Hadrian visited the former Nabataean capital, giving it the name of Hadriānī Petra Metropolis, imprinted on his coins. His visit, however, did not lead to any boom in development and new buildings as it did in Jerash. The province's governor, Sextius Florentinus, erected a monumental mausoleum for his son near the end of the al-Hubta (King's Wall) tombs, which had been generally reserved during the Nabataean period for the royal family.\nRoman emperors' interest in the city in the 3rd century suggests that Petra and its environs remained highly esteemed for a long time. An inscription to Liber Pater, a god revered by Emperor Septimius Severus, was found in the temenos of the temple known as Qasr al-Bint, and Nabataean tombs contained silver coins with the emperor's portrait as well as pottery from his reign. Emperor Elagabalus declared Petra to be a Roman colony, when he reorganized the Roman Empire towards the end of the 3rd century. The area from Petra to Wadi Mujib, the Negev, and the Sinai Peninsula were annexed into the province of Palaestina Salutaris. The Madaba Map from the reign of Emperor Justinian I is missing the section that would include Petra.\n\nByzantine period\nPetra declined rapidly under Roman rule, in large part from the revision of sea-based trade routes. In 363, an earthquake destroyed many buildings and crippled the vital water management system. The old city of Petra was the capital of the Byzantine province of Palaestina III and many churches from the Byzantine period were excavated in and around Petra. In one of them, the Byzantine Church, 140 papyri were discovered, which contained mainly contracts dated from 530s to 590s, establishing that the city was still flourishing in the 6th century. The Byzantine Church is a prime example of monumental architecture in Byzantine Petra.\nThe last reference to Byzantine Petra comes from the Spiritual Meadow of John Moschus, written in the first decades of the 7th century. He gives an anecdote about its bishop, Athenogenes. It ceased to be a metropolitan bishopric sometime before 687 when that function had been transferred to Areopolis. Petra is not mentioned in the narratives of the Muslim conquest of the Levant, nor does it appear in any early Islamic records.\n\nCrusaders and Mamluks\nIn the 12th century, the Crusaders built fortresses such as the Alwaeira Castle, but were forced to abandon Petra after a while. As a result, the location of Petra was lost until the 19th century\nTwo further Crusader-period castles are known in and around Petra: the first is al-Wu'ayra, situated just north of Wadi Musa. It can be viewed from the road to Little Petra. It is the castle that was seized by a band of Turks with the help of local Muslims and only recovered by the Crusaders after they began to destroy the olive trees of Wadi Musa. The potential loss of livelihood led the locals to negotiate a surrender. The second is on the summit of el-Habis, in the heart of Petra, and can be accessed from the West side of the Qasr al-Bint.\nThe ruins of Petra were an object of curiosity during the Middle Ages and were visited by Baibars, one of the first Mamluk sultans of Egypt, towards the end of the 13th century.\n\n19th and 20th centuries\nThe first European to describe them was the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt during his travels in 1812. At that time, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem operated a diocese in al-Karak named Battra (Arabic: باطره, Ancient Greek: Πέτρας) and it was the opinion among the clergy of Jerusalem that Kerak was the ancient city of Petra.\nBurckhardt already spoke Arabic fluently, and was on his way to explore the Niger River when he heard stories of a dead city that held the tomb of the Prophet Aaron, and became fascinated with finding the city. He then dressed himself up as a local, and only spoke in Arabic, bringing a goat with him with the intent of sacrificing it in honor of Aaron's Tomb. After one day of exploring, he was convinced that he had found the lost city of Petra.\nLéon de Laborde and Louis-Maurice-Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds made the first accurate drawings of Petra in 1828. The Scottish painter David Roberts visited Petra in 1839 and returned to Britain with sketches and stories of the encounter with local tribes, published in The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia. Frederic Edwin Church, the leading American landscape painter of the 19th century, visited Petra in 1868, and the resulting painting El Khasné, Petra is among his most important and well-documented. Missionary Archibald Forder published photographs of Petra in the December 1909 issue of National Geographic.\n\nBecause the structures weakened with age, many of the tombs became vulnerable to thieves, and many treasures were stolen. In 1929, a four-person team consisting of British archaeologists Agnes Conway and George Horsfield, Palestinian physician and folklore expert Tawfiq Canaan and Ditlef Nielsen, a Danish scholar, excavated and surveyed Petra.\nThe archaeologist Philip Hammond from the University of Utah visited Petra for nearly 40 years. He explained that the local folklore says it was created by the wand of Moses, when he struck the rock to bring forth water for the Israelites. Hammond believed the carved channels deep within the walls and ground were made from ceramic pipes that once fed water for the city, from rock-cut systems on the canyon rim.\nIn the 1980s, the Bedul Bedouin, once inhabitants of Petra, were relocated by the Jordanian government to the nearby settlement of Umm Sayhoun, a process spanning two decades. This move was part of broader initiatives aimed at settling Bedouin communities and promoting tourism in Petra. With a name meaning \"the changing ones\" and oral traditions recounting a conversion narrative, the Bedul Bedouins are believed to have adopted Islam later in their history, possibly with Jewish or Nabatean origins. Today, alongside their traditional activities, they engage in local tourism, alongside the more prominent Liyathnah tribe.\nNumerous scrolls in Greek and dating to the Byzantine period were discovered in an excavated church near the Temple of the Winged Lions in Petra in December 1993.\n\n21st century\nIn December 2022, Petra was hit by heavy flooding.\n\nLayout\nPetra is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.\nExcavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificial oasis. The area is visited by flash floods, but archaeological evidence shows that the Nabataeans controlled these floods by the use of dams, cisterns, and water conduits. These innovations stored water for prolonged periods of drought and enabled the city to prosper from its sale.\nIn ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra, around Jabal Haroun (\"Aaron's Mountain\"), the location of the Tomb of Aaron, said to be the burial place of Aaron, brother of Moses. Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north. Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east. The impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge, in places only 3–4 m (10–13 ft) wide, called the Siq (\"shaft\"), a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the sandstone rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into Wadi Musa.\n\nHellenistic architecture\nPetra is known primarily for its Hellenistic architecture. The facades of the tombs in Petra are commonly rendered in Hellenistic style, reflecting the number of diverse cultures with which the Nabataeans traded, all of which were in turn influenced by Greek culture. Most of these tombs contain small burials niches carved into the stone.\nPerhaps the best example of the Hellenistic style is seen in the Treasury, which is 24 meters (79 ft) wide and 37 meters (121 ft) tall and refers to the architecture of Alexandria. The facade of the Treasury features a broken pediment with a central tholos inside, and two obelisks appear to form into the rock at the top. Near the bottom of the Treasury are the twin Greek gods Castor and Pollux, who protect travellers on their journeys. Near the top of the Treasury, two victories are seen standing on each side of a female figure on the tholos. This female figure is believed to be the Isis-Tyche, Isis and Tyche being the Egyptian and Greek goddesses, respectively, of good fortune.\nAnother prime example of Hellenistic architecture featured in Petra is its Monastery, which stands at 45 meters (148 ft) tall and 50 meters (160 ft) wide; this is Petra's largest monument and is similarly carved into the rock face. The facade of this again features a broken pediment, similar to the Treasury, as well as another central tholos. The Monastery displays more of a Nabataen touch while at the same time incorporating elements from Greek architecture. Its only source of light is its entrance standing at 8 meters (26 ft) high. There is a large space outside of the Monastery, which is purposefully flattened for worship purposes. Formerly, in the Byzantine period, this was a place for Christian worship, but is now a holy site for pilgrims to visit.\n\nCity centre\nAt the end of the narrow gorge, the Siq, stands Petra's most elaborate ruin, popularly known as Al-Khazneh (\"the Treasury\"), hewn into the sandstone cliff. While remaining in remarkably preserved condition, the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local Bedouin tribes that hoped to dislodge riches that were once rumoured to be hidden within it.\nA little farther from the Treasury, at the foot of the mountain called en-Nejr, is a massive theatre, positioned so as to bring the greatest number of tombs within view. At the point where the valley opens out into the plain, the site of the city is revealed with striking effect. The theatre was cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs during its construction. Rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible. Almost enclosing it on three sides are rose-coloured mountain walls, divided into groups by deep fissures and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers. The theatre  was said to hold around 8,500 people. The performances that audiences were able to attend here were poetry readings and dramas. Gladiator fights were also said to be held here and attracted the most audience, although no gladiator was able to gain any momentum or fame due to the heavy mortality rate that came with it. The theatre was one of many structures in Petra that took significant damage due to the 363 Galilee earthquake.\n\nThe Petra Pool and Garden Complex is a series of structures within the city center. Originally said to be a market area, excavations at the site have allowed scholars to identify it as an elaborate Nabataean garden, which included a large swimming pool, an island-pavilion, and an intricate hydraulic system.\nAhead of the Petra Pool and Garden Complex lies Colonnaded street, which is among few artifacts of Petra that was constructed rather than natural. This street used to hold a semi-circle nymphaeum, which is now in ruins due to flash flooding, and used to hold Petra's only tree. This was intended to be a symbol for the peaceful atmosphere that the Nabataens were able to construct in Petra. Once the Romans took control of the city, Colonnaded street was narrowed to make room for a side walk, and 72 columns were added to each side.\n\nHigh Place of Sacrifice\nThe High Place of Sacrifice is perched atop Jebel Madbah Mountain. The beginning of the hike is near Petra's theatre. From there, the site of The High Place of Sacrifice is around an 800-step hike. One commonly believed sacrifice that took place there was libation. Another common form of sacrifice that took place there was animal sacrifice; this is due to the belief that the tomb of the Prophet Aaron is located in Petra, which is a sacred site for Muslims. In honor of this, a goat was sacrificed annually. Other rituals also took place there, including the burning of frankincense.\n\nRoyal Tombs\nThe Royal Tombs of Petra are in the Nabatean version of Hellenistic architecture, but their facades have worn due to natural decay. One of these tombs, the Palace Tomb, is speculated to be the tomb for the kings of Petra. The Corinthian Tomb, which is right next to the Palace Tomb, has the same Hellenistic architecture featured on the Treasury. The two other Royal Tombs are the Silk Tomb and the Urn Tomb; the Silk Tomb does not stand out as much as the Urn Tomb. The Urn Tomb features a large yard in its front, and was turned into a church in 446 AD after the expansion of Christianity.\n\nExterior platform\nIn 2016, archaeologists using satellite imagery and drones discovered a very large, previously unknown monumental structure whose beginnings were tentatively dated to about 150 BC, the time when the Nabataeans initiated their public building programme. It is located outside the main area of the city, at the foot of Jabal an-Nmayr and about 0.5 mi (0.8 km) south of the city centre, but is facing east, not towards the city, and has no visible relationship to it. The structure consists of a huge, 184 by 161 ft (56 by 49 m) platform, with a monumental staircase along its eastern side. The large platform enclosed a slightly smaller one, topped with a comparatively small building, 28 by 28 ft (8.5 by 8.5 m), which was facing east toward the staircase. The structure, second in size only to the Monastery complex, probably had a ceremonial function of which not even a speculative explanation has yet been offered by the researchers.\n\nGeostrategic importance\nPliny the Elder and other writers identify Petra as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom and the centre of their caravan trade. Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a perennial stream, Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress, but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to Gaza in the west, to Bosra and Damascus in the north, to Aqaba and Leuce Come on the Red Sea, and across the desert to the Persian Gulf.\n\nReligious importance\nNabataean religion\nThe Nabataeans worshipped Arab gods and goddesses during the pre-Islamic era as well as a few of their deified kings. One, Obodas I, was deified after his death in 85 BC. Dushara was the primary male god accompanied by his three female deities: Al-‘Uzzā, Allat and Manāt. Many statues carved in the rock depict these gods and goddesses. New evidence indicates that broader Edomite, and Nabataean theology had strong links to Earth-Sun relationships, often manifested in the orientation of prominent Petra structures to equinox and solstice sunrises and sunsets.\n\nThe Monastery, Petra's largest monument, dates from the 1st century BC. It was dedicated to Obodas I and is believed to be the symposium of Obodas the god. This information is inscribed on the ruins of the Monastery (the name is the translation of the Arabic Ad Deir).\nThe Temple of the Winged Lions is a large temple complex dated to the reign of King Aretas IV (9 BC–40 AD). The temple is located in Petra's so-called Sacred Quarter, an area situated at the end of Petra's main Colonnaded Street consisting of two majestic temples, the Qasr al-Bint and, opposite, the Temple of the Winged Lions on the northern bank of Wadi Musa.\n\nLate Roman and Byzantine-period Christianity\nChristianity found its way to Petra during the 4th century AD, nearly 500 years after the establishment of Petra as a trade centre, and the city was gradually converted over the course of the 4th century and possibly into the early 5th century AD. The start of Christianity in Petra started primarily in 330 AD when the first Christian emperor of Rome took over, Constantine I, otherwise known as Constantine the Great. Together with Licinius, he issued a decree of tolerance which stopped the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire.  Athanasius mentions a bishop of Petra (Antioch. 10) named Asterius. At least one of the tombs (now known as the \"Urn Tomb\") was used as a church. An inscription in red paint records its consecration \"in the time of the most holy bishop Jason\" (447).\n\nEarly Muslim and Crusader periods\nAfter the  Muslim conquest of 629–632, Christianity in Petra, as of most of Arabia, gave way to Islam.\nIn the wake of the First Crusade, part of Transjordan including Petra was conquered by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem and formed the second fief of the barony of Krak (in the lordship of Oultrejordain) with the title Château de la Valée de Moyse or Sela. It remained in the hands of the Franks until 1189. It is still a titular see of the Catholic Church - see Archbishop of Petra and List of Catholic titular sees: Petra in Palaestina.\n\nTraditional connection to Moses, Aaron and Miriam\nAccording to a tradition, Petra is the spot where Moses (Musa in Arabic) struck a rock with his staff and water came forth, and where Moses' brother, Aaron (Harun in Arabic), is buried, at Mount Hor, known in Arabic as Jabal Haroun, 'Mount Aaron'. Placing the death of Aaron on a mountain peak near Petra dates back to at least the time of Josephus (see Antiquities IV. 4, 7). A memorial church built in the saddle under the peak in the 5th century became the nucleus of a monastery frequented by pilgrims, named in a document from among the Petra papyri and dated to 573 as \"the House of ... High Priest Aaron.\" Wadi Musa or the \"Wadi of Moses\" is the Arabic name for the narrow valley at the head of which Petra is sited.\nA mountaintop shrine of Moses' sister Miriam was still shown to pilgrims at the time of Jerome in the 4th century, but its location has not been identified since.\n\nClimate\nIn Petra, there is a semi-arid climate. Most rain falls in the winter. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification is BSk. The average annual temperature in Petra is 15.5 °C (59.9 °F). About 193 mm (7.60 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nConservation\nThe Bedul (Petra Bedouin) were forcibly resettled from their cave dwellings in Petra to Umm Sayhoun/Um Seihun by the Jordanian government in 1985, prior to the UNESCO designation process. They were provided with block-built housing with some infrastructure including in particular a sewage and drainage system. Among the six communities in the Petra Region, Umm Sayhoun is one of the smaller communities. The village of Wadi Musa is the largest in the area, inhabited largely by the Layathnah Bedouin, and is now the closest settlement to the visitor centre, the main entrance via the Siq and the archaeological site generally. Umm Sayhoun gives access to the 'back route' into the site, the Wadi Turkmaniyeh pedestrian route.\nOn December 6, 1985, Petra was designated a World Heritage Site. In a popular poll in 2007, it was also named one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. The Petra Archaeological Park (PAP) became an autonomous legal entity over the management of this site in August 2007.\n\nThe Bedoul belong to one of the Bedouin tribes whose cultural heritage and traditional skills were proclaimed by UNESCO on the Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2005 and inscribed in 2008.\nIn 2011, following an 11-month project planning phase, the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority in association with DesignWorkshop and JCP s.r.l published a Strategic Master Plan that guides planned development of the Petra Region. This is intended to guide planned development of the Petra Region in an efficient, balanced and sustainable way over the next 20 years for the benefit of the local population and of Jordan in general. As part of this, a Strategic Plan was developed for Umm Sayhoun and surrounding areas.\nThe process of developing the Strategic Plan considered the area's needs from five points of view:\n\nA socio-economic perspective\nThe perspective of Petra Archaeological Park\nThe perspective of Petra's tourism product\nA land use perspective\nAn environmental perspective\nThe site suffers from a host of threats, including collapse of ancient structures, erosion due to flooding and improper rainwater drainage, weathering from salt upwelling, improper restoration of ancient structures, and unsustainable tourism. The last has increased substantially, especially since the site received widespread media coverage in 2007 during the New 7 Wonders of the World Internet and cellphone campaign. Tourism has steadily grown, with Petra receiving 1.2 million total visitors in 2019.\nIn an attempt to reduce the problems, the Petra National Trust (PNT) was established in 1989. It has worked with numerous local and international organisations on projects that promote the protection, conservation, and preservation of the Petra site. Moreover, UNESCO and ICOMOS recently collaborated to publish their first book on human and natural threats to the sensitive World Heritage sites. They chose Petra as its first and the most important example of threatened landscapes. The presentation Tourism and Archaeological Heritage Management at Petra: Driver to Development or Destruction? (2012) was the first in a series to address the very nature of these deteriorating buildings, cities, sites, and regions.\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) released a video in 2018 highlighting the abuse of working animals in Petra. PETA claimed that animals are forced to carry tourists or pull carriages every day. The video showed handlers beating and whipping working animals, with beatings intensifying when animals faltered. PETA also showed some wounded animals, including camels with fly-infested, open wounds. The Jordanian authority running the site responded by proposing a veterinary clinic, and by undertaking to spread awareness among animal handlers. In 2020, more video released by PETA indicated that conditions for the animals had not improved and, in 2021, the organization was running what appeared to be the only veterinary clinic in the area.\n\nPetra is a site at the intersection of natural and cultural heritage forming a unique cultural landscape. Ever since Johann Ludwig Burckhardt aka Sheikh Ibrahim had re-discovered the ruin city in Petra, Jordan, in 1812, the cultural heritage site has attracted different people who shared an interest in the ancient history and culture of the Nabataeans such as travellers, pilgrims, painters and savants. However, it was not until the late 19th century that the ruins were systematically approached by archaeological researchers. Since then regular archaeological excavations and ongoing research on the Nabataean culture have been part of today's UNESCO world cultural heritage site Petra. Through the excavations in the Petra Archaeological Park an increasing number of Nabataean cultural heritage is being exposed to environmental impact. A central issue is the management of water impacting the built heritage and the rock hewn facades. The large number of discoveries and the exposure of structures and findings demand conservation measures respecting the interlinkage between the natural landscape and cultural heritage, as especially this connection is a central challenge at the UNECSO World Heritage Site.\nIn recent years different conservation campaigns and projects were established at the cultural heritage site of Petra. The main works first focussed on the entrance situation of the Siq to protect tourists and to facilitate access. Also, different projects for conservation and conservation research were conducted. Following is a list of projects, to be continued.\n\n1958 Restoration of the third pillar of the Treasury building (Al-Khazneh).

It played a prominent role in the Marcus Didius Falco mystery novel Last Act in Palmyra, and is the setting for Agatha Christie's Appointment with Death. In Blue Balliett's novel Chasing Vermeer, the character Petra Andalee is named after the site.\nIn 1979 Marguerite van Geldermalsen from New Zealand married Mohammed Abdullah, a Bedouin in Petra.

      "summary": "Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء‎, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα, lit. 'Rock'), originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu (Nabataean Aramaic: 𐢛𐢚𐢒‎ or 𐢛𐢚𐢓𐢈‎, *Raqēmō), is an ancient city and archaeological site in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also called the \"Rose City\" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved. The city is one of the New 7 Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and was settled by the Nabataeans, a nomadic Arab people, in the 4th century BC. Petra would later become the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom in the second century BC. The Nabataeans invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub, which gained them considerable revenue. Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and thus were able to defend their kingdom. They were particularly skillful in agriculture, stone carving, and rainwater harvesting.\nPetra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants. Nabataea fell to the Romans in 106 AD, who annexed and renamed it Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.\nUNESCO has described Petra as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\". Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Visitor numbers reach close to a million tourists every year.",

      "content": "البتراء او البترا او البطراء مدينه اثريه وتاريخيه تقع في محافظه معان في جنوب المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه. تشتهر بعمارتها المنحوته بالصخور ونظام قنوات جر المياه القديمه. اُطلق عليها قديمًا اسم «سلع»، كما سُميت بـ «المدينه الورديه» نسبهً لالوان صخورها الملتويه.\nاُسست البتراء تقريبًا في عام 312 ق.م عاصمه لمملكه الانباط. وقد تبوات مكانهً مرموقهً لسنوات طويله، حيث كان لموقعها على طريق الحرير، والمتوسط لحضارات بلاد ما بين النهرين وفلسطين ومصر، دورًا كبيرًا جعل من دوله الانباط تمسك بزمام التجاره بين حضارات هذه المناطق وسكانها. وتقع المدينه على منحدرات جبل المذبح، بين مجموعه من الجبال الصخريه الشاهقه، التي تُشكل الخاصره الشماليه الغربيه لشبه الجزيره العربيه، وتحديدًا وادي عربه، الممتد من البحر الميت وحتى خليج العقبه.\nبقي موقع البتراء غير مكتشف للغرب طيله الفتره العثمانيه، حتى اعاد اكتشافها المستشرق السويسري يوهان لودفيغ بركهارت عام 1812. وقد اُدرجت مدينه البتراء على لائحه التراث العالمي التابعه لليونسكو في عام 1985. واختيرت احدى عجائب الدنيا السبع الجديده عام 2007.\nوتُعد البتراء اليوم، رمزًا للاردن، واكثر الاماكن جذبًا للسياح على مستوى المملكه. كما انها واحده من اهم الوجهات السياحيه لزعماء العالم. ولقد احتفلت المدينه بالزائر رقم مليون لاول مره في تاريخ السياحه الاردنيّه، وذلك في شهر تشرين الثاني/ نوفمبر 2019.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع مدينه البتراء في لواء البتراء التابع لمحافظه معان، على بعد 225 كيلومتر جنوب العاصمه الاردنيه عمّان، والى الغرب من الطريق الصحراوي الذي يصل بين عمّان ومدينه العقبه على ساحل خليج العقبه. يقع اللواء في الجهه الغربيه من مدينه معان مركز المحافظه، ويبعد عنها 36 كم. ويتواجد على امتداد سلسله جبال الشراه المطله على وادي عربه وطبيعتها الجغرافيه المنحدره والمحاطه بالجبال. تبلغ مساحه اللواء 900 كم2 ، اما مساحه المحميه الاثريه فتبلغ 264 كم2. وتُعتبر البتراء احد مناطق هذا اللواء، ومركزه مدينه وادي موسى.\nتتميز مدينه البتراء بانها مدينه محفوره في الحجر الرملي الملون في صخور جبال وادي موسى الوردي، ولذا سُميت بـ «المدينه الورديه». ويمكن للزائر ان يصل اليها بواسطه السياره وبعدها يبدا في السير بين جنبات مدينه ضخمه محفوره في الصخر، ومختبئه خلف حاجز منيع من الجبال المتراصه التي بالكاد يسهل اختراقها يطلق عليه اسم السيق.\n\nالجيولوجيا\nمن اهم المظاهر الجيولوجيه في مناطق البتراء؛ التكشفات الصخريه والتي تبين معظم الفترات والعصور والاعمار على السلم الجيولوجي، لتاثر المنطقه بعمليات تكتونيه ناجمه عن حركه انفتاح وتوسع صدع البحر الميت، حيث تتكشف صخور القاعده الجرانيتيه في وادي نمله شمال غرب منطقه بيضاء البترا، والتي تعود الى فترات ما قبل الكامبري بعمر 650 مليون سنه.\nتمتاز منطقه البتراء بتكشفات الصخور الرسوبيه والرمال التي تتكون من فتات معادن الفلدسبار وغيرها والتي تعود للعصر الكامبري والاوردوفيشي، حيث ترسّبت في بيئات نهريه ادت الى نقلها وترسيبها انذاك، ومن ثم وللاعلى تتكشف مباشره صخور العصر الكريتاسي وبوجود عدم توافق ترسيبي يفسر بعمليات؛ زوال صخور عصور معروفه كالسيلوري والجوراسي وانقطاع في الترسيب في تلك العصور. توجد ايضا تراكيب جيولوجيه مثاليه كالصدوع والطيات، والمقاطع الجيولوجيه المثاليه التي تتجمل بالوان زاهيه، اضافه الينابيع والكهوف الطبيعيه، والاحافير الممثله لكافه العصور الجيولوجيه. من اهم التراكيب الجيولوجيه في البترا هي؛ صدع وادي موسى، حيث تاثرت المنطقه بصدع راسي اتجاهه شمال- جنوب؛ وهو احد الصدوع الرئيسيه في جنوب الاردن. وتعمل سلطه اقليم البترا على التمهيد من اجل اطلاق مشروع السياحه الجيولوجيه من خلال التعاون مع سلطه المصادر الطبيعيه الاردنيه، وتعد هذه التجربه الاولى من نوعها في المملكه.\n\nالحياه البريه\nينتشر شجر العرعر الفينيقي في البتراء كونها امتدادا لمناطق تواجده في المشرق العربي. وهو نوع نباتي شجري من جنس العرعر يتبع الفصيله السرويه.\nتقع البتراء في جنوب بلاد الشام، حيث وادي عربه وصحراء النقب. تعيش في هذه البيئات انواع عشبيه حوليه ومعمره. توجد كثير من الانواع البصيليه والدرنيه مثل العنصل والبلفيه (باللاتينيه: Bellevalia) من الفصيله الهليونيه والعصفلدين من الفصيله الزانثوريه. وتوجد عده انواع من الحثره (باللاتينيه: Boerhavia) ومن الصدح (باللاتينيه: Commicarpus) من الفصيله الشّبّيّه (باللاتينيه: Nyctaginaceae).\n\nتتميز منطقه النقب ببعض الانواع التي تعد امتداداً للغطاء النباتي في افريقيا. من هذه الانواع العشار الباسق (باللاتينيه: Calotropis procera) واربعه انواع من السنط احدها السنط الملتوي (باللاتينيه: Acacia tortilis). كذلك، توجد اجناس نباتيه تتواجد في معظم البيئات الشاميه المذكوره اعلاه مثل السوسن الذي ينتشر منه اكثر من ثلاثين نوعًا تتوزع على مختلف مناطق الشام حسب تاقلم كل نوع منها. كذلك ينتشر اكثر من خمسين نوعًا من جنس الثوم (الفصيله الثوميه) واربعين من القنطريون (الفصيله النجميه) في مناطق الشام المختلفه من مرعش الى سيناء وسبعه وثلاثون نوعا من الاربيان من الفصيله النجميه.\nاما بالنسبه للحيوانات، فيعيش في البتراء كل من الجمال والخيول والماعز والحمير لتحملها حراره الاجواء ولتكيفها مع بيئتها الجافه.\n\nالمناخ\nالتاريخ\nيعود الفضل في بناء البتراء الى الانباط، الا انه قبل الانباط كان يعيش في هذه المنطقه شعب يدعى الادوميين الذين كانوا في حاله عداء دائم مع الدول المجاوره لهم. وقد استوطن الادميون التلال المحيطه بالبتراء من 1200 – 539 ق. م ولم يدخلوا البتراء بل فضّلوا الاقامه على التلال المحيطه بها، ولم يكن لديهم المام او اهتمام بالنحت او البناء في الصخر، بل كانت براعتهم محصوره في صناعه الفخاريات التي يبدو انهم نقلوها الى العرب الانباط الذين استقروا في هذه المنطقه بعد هجرتهم من الجزيره العربيه في نهايه القرن السادس قبل الميلاد. لقد احتل الادوميون جزءاً هاماً من المنطقه التي كانت عند تقاطع عده طرق تجاريه مهمه واستفادوا كثيرًا من القوافل التجاريه التي كانت تمر عبر طرقهم. ويُعتقد بان الادوميين قد هزمهم اليهود بقياده الملك سليمان الذين بسطوا سيطرتهم على هذه المنطقه لمده مائتي عام. بعد ذلك قام البابليون بغزو فلسطين، واخذوا اليهود واخذوهم اسرى. وبدا الادوميون الذين طُردوا من هذه المنطقه بالتحرك لاعاده احتلال الاراضي التي كانت فيما مضى خاضعه لسيطرتهم. ومع ذلك فقد اجتاح الانباط هذه المنطقه مره اخرى وهم قبيله بدويه ينحدرون من اصول عربيه. تعايش الانباط مع الادوميين في حياه اكثر استقرارًا.\n\nالعرب الانباط\nكانت البتراء عاصمه لدوله الانباط واهم مدن مملكتهم العربيه التي دامت ما بين 400 ق.م وحتى 106 م، وقد امتدت حدودها من ساحل عسقلان في فلسطين غربًا وحتى صحراء بلاد الشام شرقًا، ومن الشمال دمشق وحتى البحر الاحمر جنوبًا. في عام 300 قبل الميلاد، كان الانباط قد حققوا السيطره التامه على المنطقه، وبنوا لانفسهم مستعمره حضريه، حيث قاموا بنحت احيائهم السكنيه ومبانيهم وقبورهم في الصخور بجانب الجبال. وفي اوج ازدهارهم في القرن الاول قبل الميلاد كان يعيش في مدينه البتراء مايقارب 30,000 نسمه، كان يحكمهم ملك منذ العام 168 قبل الميلاد وانشاوا دوله تمثل ديمقراطيه، حيث كان الملك عرضه للمحاسبه عن كل افعاله.\nشكل موقع البتراء المتوسط بين حضارات بلاد ما بين النهرين وبلاد الشام والجزيره العربيه ومصر اهميه اقتصاديه، فقد امسكت دوله الانباط بزمام التجاره بين حضارات هذه المناطق وسكانها وكانت القوافل التجاريه تصل اليها محمله بالتوابل والبهارات من جنوب الجزيره العربيه والحرير من غزه ودمشق والحناء من عسقلان والزجاجيات من صور وصيدا واللؤلؤ من الخليج العربي.\n\nكان الانباط في البتراء يتكلمون لغه تشبه الاراميه. وقد اصبحت البتراء عاصمه ثقافيه موازيه ومساويه للمدن الفينيقيه واليونانيه، حيث يُعتقد ان الخط العربي الابجدي قد نشا وتطور في هذه المنطقه، على يد الانباط العرب. كما كُتب به الحرف العبري في مرحله ما. وقد انتشر الحرف النبطي بعد ان تبناه الاسلام، وكُتبت به لغات امم اخرى في بلاد عده لا يقل مجموعها عن خمسه عشر. لقد انتج الانباط اواني فخاريه جميله، ومباني عظيمه تاثر معظمها فيما بعد بالاسلوب الروماني. في بدايه القرن الاول الميلادي، اصبحت مدينه البتراء مركز التجاره مجدداً بسبب الحروب الدائمه بين مصر وسوريه. وخلال وقت قصير، اصبح الانباط اثرياء واقوياء بما في الكفايه ليبسطوا سيطرتهم على المنطقه. ولكونهم زادوا ثراءً تحسن اسلوب حياتهم، وهو ما انعكس بدوره على الديكورات الفخمه الموجوده على قبور الانباط الجدد.\nاستطاع العرب الانباط في البدايات، مقاومه محاولات السيطره عليهم واخضاعهم، وابقوا منطقه دائره الاردن التاريخيه خاليه نسبيا من النفوذ الاجنبي. ومن بين اهم مواجهاتهم العسكريه، وقوفهم في وجه النفوذ السلوقي (اليوناني) في عام 312 ق.م. اذ استطاعوا رد الجيش اليوناني مهزومًا بعد ان قتلوا معظم افراده في الحمله الاولى، وردوا الحمله اليونانيه الثانيه بعد ان حاصر الاغريق مدينتهم لمده طويله. كذلك انتصر الانباط في اول معركه بحريه يخوضها جيش عربي، وذلك في مياه البحر الميت، وهي المعركه التي انهت احلام اليونان واطماعهم بالاستيلاء على شرق الاردن. كما واجه العرب الانباط اليهود في مواجهات واسعه سجلوا في معظمها الانتصار رغم الحمايه الرومانيه التي كانوا يتمتعون فيها.\n\nالرومان والبيزنطيون\nغزا الجنرال الروماني بومباي المملكه النبطيه في نحو عام 60 قبل الميلاد، الا انه سمح بقدر من الحكم الذاتي فيها. ولقد كانت نهايه دوله الانباط على يد الرومان عندما حاصروها ومنعوا عنها مصادر المياه سنه 106، حتى ضموها لامبراطوريتهم، واطلقوا عليها اسم مقاطعه \"Arabia Petraea\"، وعاصمتها البتراء.\nوكان الانباط قد حققوا ارباحًا كبيره من التجاره الرومانيه والهنديه والعربيه على اراضيهم. الا ان استيلاء الرومان على البتراء جعلهم يسيطرون على هذه الطرق. وقد بدا الرومان ببناء وتشييد ابنيتهم الخاصه في البتراء واقاموا في المدينه مدرجاً، كما قاموا بتشييد معبد قصر البنت، وهو البناء الوحيد الذي ما زال قائماً في قلب المدينه حيث كان يقع السوق الكبير. وفي هذا المكان كانت القوافل تقايض القوافل الاخرى القادمه من الغرب بالتوابل والعاج والعنبر والقماش. استمرت البتراء مركزًا تجاريًا مهمًا لمده قرنين اخرين من الزمن. وبعد ذلك تضاءلت اهميتها مع استمرار بعض المدن في الشمال مثل تدمر بجذب التجاره اليها. وبالتدريج غادر التجار وغادرت معهم جيوش الرومان التي كانت مهمتها حمايه الطرق التجاريه. وبعد تحول الامبراطوريه الرومانيه الى الديانه المسيحيه، حظيت البتراء بمطرانيه، وتحولت بعض ابنيتها الى كنائس. لكن المدينه التي حكمها البيزنطيون، فقدت مجدها السابق ولم يتبق منها الا الاطلال. ويبدو ان المسيحيه قد دخلت البتراء قبل وخلال الفتره المبكره من العصر البيزنطي، رغم انتشار الوثنيه جنبًا الى جنب معها، حيث كانت الكنائس والمعابد الوثنيه موجوده حتى القرن الخامس.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nاصبح من تبقى من سكان البتراء يعتاشون على الزراعه قبل وصول الاسلام للشام، وتحديدًا في سنه 636، لكن الزلزال الذي ضربها سنه 746 و 748 وزلازل اخرى قامت بافراغها من اهلها. وقد ورد ذكر منطقه البتراء وجوارها في المصادر التاريخيه المعاصره للحروب الصليبيه. وتشير هذه المصادر الى ان وادي موسى كانت منطقه خصبه، وبها مياه وفيره، كما تشير الوثائق التي تعود لهذه الفتره الى وجود كنيسه في منطقه جبل هارون. وقد قام الصليبيون بحمله عسكريه على البتراء ووادي موسى تالفت من الفرسان والمشاه في نهايه عام 1100 وبقياده ملك الفرنجه بالدوين الاول. وقد شيّدوا فيها قلعتين بعد ذلك. كما بنى المماليك مقاما للنبي هارون في البتراء على جبل يرتفع 1353 متر عن سطح البحر، في سياق اهتمامهم بالمقامات والقبور. ولكن المدينه دخلت في سبات طويل في الفتره العثمانيه، وحتى اعاده اكتشافها في عام 1812.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nمع بدء رحلات المستشرقين للوطن العربي في القرن التاسع عشر، اكتشف البتراء عام 1812م المستشرق السويسري يوهان لودفيغ بركهارت، الذي تعلم اللغه العربيه ودرس الاسلام في سوريا وجاء الى البتراء مدعيًا بانه مسلم من الهند بعد ان تنكّر بزي اسلامي، وهدفه تقديم اضحيه الى النبي هارون؛ وبذلك سمح له السكان المحليون بالدخول الى المدينه الورديه. وقد احتوى كتابه المطبوع عام 1828 والمعروف باسم «رحلات في سوريا والديار المقدسه» على صور للبتراء.\nتطورت اهميه البتراء اداريًا مع نشوء اماره شرق الاردن في عام 1921، حيث تاسست مديريه ناحيه في وادي موسى. وفي عام 1973 رفعت الوحده الاداريه من ناحيه الى قضاء. في عام 1996 رُفعت الى لواء. في عام 2001 تغير اسم لواء وادي موسى الى لواء البتراء. وتعتبر مدينه وادي موسى مركز اللواء.\nنفًّذت مديريه المصادر التراثيه الاردنيه 22 حفريه اثريه مع عدد من البعثات الغربيه اُنجزت في منطقتيّ البترا والبيضا. وقد وُضعت مدينه البتراء منذ عام 1985 ضمن قائمه اليونسكو لمواقع التراث العالمي، نظرًا لتفرد المدينه من الناحيه الطبيعيه والتاريخيه والجغرافيه، ولاحتوائها على مزيج فريد من تراث الحضارات القديمه التي تنتمي الى حضارات متنوعه يذكر منها اثار الادوميين، واليونانيين، والانباط، والرومان، والبيزنطيين، والصليبين، والمماليك. ومنذ ذلك التاريخ عقدت عده ورش عمل، عنيت بترميم وحمايه اثار البتراء. وتاسست في عام 1992 اللجنه الوطنيه لحمايه البتراء في المجلس الاعلى للعلوم والتكنولوجيا، وقامت جمعيات غير حكوميه اعلنت برامج في هذا المجال. وقد وصل عدد زوار البتراء الاجمالي في عام 2010 الى 900,000 زائر، مقتربًا من الطاقه الاستيعابيه القصوى لمحميه البتراء الاثريه والبالغه 1.13 مليون\nزائر حسب تقديرات منظمه اليونسكو.\nوقد اختيرت البتراء في 7 تموز/ يوليو 2007 ثانيه عجائب الدنيا السبع الجديده، بعد الدعم الرسمي للتصويت، حيث اُعتبر الامر واجبًا وطنيًا. وقامت الحكومه الاردنيه بحملات دعائيه ضخمه من اجل البتراء في الصحف الاردنيه والاذاعه الاردنيه والتلفزيون الاردني لتحفّز مواطني المملكه على التصويت. وبدات الشركات باطلاق الحملات لدعم التصويت.\nكما تاسس في البتراء عام 2009، سلطه ذات استقلال مالي واداري، هي سلطه اقليم البترا التنموي السياحي. والتي تهدف الى تنميه الاقليم وتطويره سياحيًا واقتصاديًا واجتماعيًا وثقافيًا، والمساهمه في تنميه المجتمع المحلي.\n\nالعماره\nتاثرت العماره النبطيه عمومًا، وعماره البتراء خصوصًا، بفن العماره المصريه والاشوريه والاغريقيه. ويظهر هذا جلّيًا في كثير من مباني العماره الجنائزيه المتمثله بالمقابر الملكيه المنحوته، والمقابر المبنيه بالحجر المقطوع. لقد اهتم الانباط اهتمامًا كبيرًا بمقابرهم، مما انعكس في عمارتها التي حُشد فيها الكثير من الفنون المعماريه والفنيه ومما يوحي باهتمام الانباط «بالحياه الاخره» بالنسبه للاموات. وبالنسبه للمقابر الملكيه المنحوته، فتُعتبر من اكثر ما اشتهر به الانباط. وقد اُجريت عليها العديد من الدراسات المتخصصه اظهرت ان المهندس النبطي جمع بين التاثيرات الخارجيه من الحضارات المجاوره مع الذوق النبطي. ويمكن مشاهده الكثير من هذه القبور في اماكن مختلفه من البتراء وما حولها وخصوصًا في الطريق قبل الوصول الى السيق. من قبور البتراء الشهيره: قبر «المسلات» وقبر «الجره» و «القبر ذو النوافذ».\nتتسم عماره الانباط باستخدم العديد من المواد حسب توفرها في البيئه، فبالاضافه الى نحت الصخور الرمليه والكلسيه وجعلها مساكن ومنشات وقبور وتماثيل وغيرها، فقد استخدمت كل انواع الحجاره في البناء النبطي حيثما فرضت البيئه ذلك، ففي الصحراء مثلا، جرى استخدام الحجاره البازلتيه السوداء لمختلف اغراض البناء. وفي معظم الابنيه الكبيره كالمعابد استخدمت فنون معماريه كثيره منها الاقواس الكبيره والصغيره التي تعتمد على تراص الحجاره لا على المونه او الدعم الارضي بالاعمده، وفي بعض الحالات جرى سقف بعض الابنيه او الحجرات بصفوف متلاصقه من هذه الحجاره قبل ان تجري تغطيتها بالملاط الطيني من فوقها لدرء امطار الشتاء ولعزل حراره الصيف ايضًا. وبالنسبه للمواد الاخرى المساعده، فقد استخدمت الاخشاب في التسقيف وصناعه الابواب والشبابيك، ويبدو ذلك في منطقه وادي موسى والبتراء بسبب توفر الاشجار في المنطقه. وعرف الانباط استخداما اخر للاخشاب في البناء من شانه تعزيز صمود الجدران امام الهزات الارضيه، حيث عثر على بقايا تلك الاخشاب في بعض الابنيه منها بناء «قصر البنت» في البتراء.\nمن جهه اخرى، يُعتبر النظام الهندسي للماء الانجاز الاهم للحضاره النبطيه بالمدينه، والذي جعل الحياه ممكنه في هذه المنطقه الجافه من الصحراء الاردنيه. وقد تضمن ذلك النظام انظمه لحفظ المياه واشتمل على السدود التي كانت تجمع مياه الامطار في اشهر الشتاء. كما استخدم الانباط نظاماً محكماً من القنوات والانابيب الفخاريه لتوزيع المياه في كافه انحاء المدينه.\nالتخطيط الحضري\n\nلقد بُنيت مباني البتراء وفق مخطط المدينه العام، حيث الشارع الرئيس الذي تاثر بمخطط المدينه الرومانيه، اذ ان الشارع يكاد يقسم المدينه الى نصفين، وهو يحاذي الوادي مما اضطر المهندس النبطي لبناء بعض القنوات تحت ارض الشارع. وكذلك العبارات والاقواس الحجريه التي ترتفع عن سيل الوادي في فصل الشتاء. وما يزال بالامكان ملاحظه بعض اثار هذه المرافق في الشارع الرئيسي بعد الانتهاء من ساحه الخزنه.\nيُعد الشارع المُعمد من اهم شوارع مدينه البتراء، حيث قام الانباط بتشييده، ثم اعاد الرومان بنائه في عام 106 بعد احتلالهم للبتراء. يبلغ عرضه 6 امتار، وقد كانت تقوم على جانبيه مباني من طابق واحد الى طابقين، كما يوجد على يسار الشارع المعمد باتجاه الجنوب مجموعه من السلالم تقود لساحه مكشوفه تسمى بـ «السوق»، حيث كانت تجري كافه انواع النشاطات والمعاملات التجاريه. وعلى ما يبدو ان هذه المنطقه كانت القلب النابض للمدينه ومركز النشاطات التجاريه المختلفه منذ القرن الثالث ق.م. وقد استمر استعمال الشارع خلال الفتره البيزنطيه في القرنين الرابع والخامس وحتى السادس.\nيوجد في المدينه ايضًا احد الطرق المشهوره، وهو شارع الواجهات. ويقع بالقرب من منطقه الخزنه، حيث يبدا السيق بالاتساع تدريجيًا حيث يصل الزوار الى منطقه مفتوحه وعلى الجانبين يوجد عددًا من واجهات المدافن النبطيه المزينه بالمسننات والكورنيشات والادراج المقلوبه. ولقد دُمر بعض هذه الواجهات بفعل العوامل الطبيعيه، وربما تعود هذه الواجهات الى موظفين كبار في الدوله او بعض الامراء.\n\nالمواقع الاثريه داخل البتراء\nاكتشف نحو 3,000 معلم اثري في البتراء، تشكل منها المعالم المعروفه نحو 800 معلمًا، اهمها:\n\nالسيق\nهو الطريق الرئيس المؤدي لمدينه البتراء. وهو شق صخري يتلوّى بطول نحو 1200 متر وبعرض يتراوح من 3 - 12 متر، ويصل ارتفاعه الى نحو 80 متر. يُعتبر الجزء الاكبر منه طبيعي، بالاضافه الى جزء اخر نحته الانباط. ينتهي السيق في الجهه المقابله للخزنه.\nيُمكن مشاهده بقايا لقوس يمثل بوابه المدينه في بدايه السيق، الذي يوجد على جانبيه قنوات لجر المياه ممتده من عيون وادي موسى في الخارج الى المدينه في الداخل. كما يمكن مشاهده السدود الجانبيه، التي اقيمت في مكان السدود النبطيه الاصليه، لمنع تدفق المياه الى السيق، وحجزها والاستفاده منها. لقد كانت ارضيه السيق مبلطه ببلاطات حجريه جزء منها يمكن مشاهدته في مكانه الاصلي. وقد زُينت جوانب السيق بالمنحوتات النبطيه ومعظمها منحوتات تمثل الهه. وتوجد تماثيل الالهه ومحاريبها قريبه جداً من هذه القنوات بل وملاصقه لها احيانا، لاعتقاد الانباط وايمانهم الشديد بان المياه مقدسه.\nيمكن ايضا مشاهده مجموعه من المنحوتات على الجانب الايسر من السيق تُعرف باسم «اصنام سابينوس»، وقد سُمّيت هذه المجموعه بهذا الاسم لوجود نقش باليونانيه تحت الحنيه الثانيه على يسار الزائر وهو متجه لاخر السيق. يشير النقش الى ان سابينوس ابن الاسكندر المقدوني، والذي جاء من درعا، امر بنحت هذه الحنيات او المحاريب تمجيداً للالهه النبطيه. ومن المنحوتات المهمه ايضا بقايا منحوتات لجمال ورجل تمثل قافله تجاريه، حيث اشتهر الانباط بالتجاره، وكانت احد اسباب ثرائهم الواسع.\n\nالخزنه\nيُعتبر مبنى الخزنه المنحوته في الصخر، اشهر معالم البتراء واكثرها اهميه، حيث اختار الانباط موقعها بعنايه ليكون اول معلم يواجه الزائر بعد دخول المدينه. وقد سُمّيت بهذا الاسم لاعتقاد البدو المحليين سابقًا بان الجره الموجوده في اعلى الواجهه تحوي كنزًا، ولكنها في الواقع ضريح ملكي. تتكون واجهه الخزنه من طابقين بعرض 25 مترا وارتفاع 39 مترا. وقد افرغت مئات الاف الامتار المكعبه من الحجر الرملي من الخزنه عندما اُعيد اكتشافها في القرن التاسع عشر، لتظهر الواجهه بوضعها النهائي الحالي. ويتكون الطابق السفلي من سته اعمده على طول الواجهه الاماميه تقف فوق مصطبه في وسطها سلم، وتتوج الاعمده من الاعلى بثلاثه ارباع عمود، يبلغ طول العمود في الطابق السفلي نحو 12 مترا، وفي الطابق العلوي يبلغ ارتفاعه 9 امتار، كما يبلغ ارتفاع الجره في الاعلى نحو 3,5 مترا.\nويظهر التناظر الكبير في الواجهه، بالاضافه الى المزيج بين الفنون المعماريه المصريه والهلنستيه مع الطابع المعماري النبطي. وحول هدف انشاء هذا المبنى عده اراء، فيرى بعض علماء الاثار انه بُني معبدًا او مكان لحفظ الوثائق، ولكن الحفريات الاثريه الحديثه في البتراء اثبتت وجود مدافن اسفل ساحه مبنى الخزنه، والتي يمكن مشاهدتها الان من الاعلى من خلال الشبك الحديدي الموجود فوقها. كما ان هذه المدافن قُطعت لبناء الخزنه مع المحافظه عليها. وبذلك تكون الخزنه مدفنا. ويثبت مع القرن الاول الميلادي زمن الملك الحارث الرابع ملك الانباط. وعلى الاغلب تشكل مدفناً لهذا الملك.\nويتكون مبنى الخزنه من الداخل من ثلاث حجرات، اثنتان على الجانب وواحده في الوسط. والحجرتان الجانبيتان خاليتان عدا عن قبر حفر في الحجره الغربيه، اما الحجره الوسطى فيصعد اليها بدرج ويبلغ طولها 12,5 متر، وعلى جوانبها الثلاث توجد حجرات صغيره للدفن. ويوجد على جانبي مبنى الخزنه من الخارج ثقوب صغيره على الجانبين مزدوجه في النصف الاعلى من مبنى الخزنه ربما تكون استخدمت لتثبيت السقالات اثناء عمليه النحت. ويوجد في اعلى مبنى الخزنه قناه بعرض 90 سم لتصريف المياه ومنعها للنزول على هذه الواجهه. وقد قامت الحفريات الحديثه بتنظيف هذه القناه.\n\nالدير\nوهو من المباني المهمه في منطقه البتراء، ويعود تاريخه الى النصف الاول من القرن الاول قبل الميلاد، ويتكون المبنى من طابقين، ويُعتقد انه احتوى على تماثيل متحركه التيجان. وهو اكبر حجماً من مبنى الخزنه، حيث يصل عرضه الى 50 مترا، اما ارتفاعه فيصل الى 50 مترا.\nويُعتقد ان واجهه مبنى الدير قد حُوِّلت الى دير للرهبان اثناء فتره حكم الدوله البيزنطيه في بلاد الشام، وذلك لوجود اثار للصلبان المحفوره في الصخر في الغرفه الوحيده الموجوده في الطابق السفلي من الواجهه. كما يُعتقد بانه الساحه الواقعه امام الواجهه قد بُلّطت.\n\nمسرح البتراء\nمن اكبر المباني في البتراء، ولقد بُني في القرن الاول للميلاد على شكل نصف دائره بقطر 95 مترا، وبارتفاع 23 مترا. وهو منحوت في الصخر باستثناء الجزء الامامي منه فهو مبني، ويستوعب المسرح من 7 - 10 الاف مشاهد، كما تتكون مقاعد المشاهدين من 45 صفًا من المقاعد المقسمه افقيًا الى ثلاثه اقسام، الاسفل 11 صفا والاوسط 34 صفا والعلوي 10 صفوف، وهي مقسمه ايضًا من خلال الادراج الخمسه الى سته اجزاء، ويوجد فوق المدرجات قطع صخري مقطوع من بعض المدافن السابقه لبناء المسرح.\nقطعت ساحه الاوركسترا بالصخر، كما ان الممران الجانبيان للساحه مقطوعان ايضًا في الصخر ومسقفان بالحجاره على شكل عقد. اما الجدار الخلفي للمسرح فيتكون بالاصل من 3 طوابق ومزيّن بالكوات والاعمده وواجهته مغطاه بالالواح الرخاميه.\n\nقصر البنت\nيُطلق عليه ايضًا «قصر بنت فرعون»، وهو معبد نبطي من القرن الاول قبل الميلاد. وتكمن اهميه هذا القصر بانه احد مباني البتراء القليله التي صمدت رغم الزلازل، وذلك بسبب طريقه بنائهِ باستخدام مداميك وضع فيها خشب العرعر، مما جعل جدرانه اكثر طواعيه للحركه اثناء الزلازل. ان الحنيه التي تقع على يمين الساحه الاماميه لقصر البنت كانت قد صممت اصلا لتخليد الامبراطور الروماني وعائلته عندما احتل الرومان مدينه البتراء، حيث ان هذا التقليد معروف عند الرومان.\nوقد كان هذا المعبد مخصصًا لواحده من الالهه الرئيسيه، ويجادل البعض ان هذه الالهه هي اللات فيما يعتقد اخرون انها العزى، وراى اخرون انه للاله الاعلى ذو الشرى. وكان من المثير للنقاش علاقه هذا المعبد بالالهه ايزيس المعبوده المصريه، وكان ذلك من الظواهر المستغربه.\n\nالمحكمه\nهو مبنى متكون من مجموعه من الواجهات المهمه، واولها «قبر الجره»، ويعود تاريخه الى النصف الاول من القرن الاول الميلادي، ويقع على الجهه المقابله للمدرج النبطي. ويبلغ عرض الواجهه نحو 16 مترا، وبارتفاع 26 مترا. وتتكون من طابقين من الجدران التي تدعم اقواسًا تحت مستوى صاله المدفن، وهي مدمجه مع حجرات دفن جزء منها منحوت والاخر مبني. ويوجد سلم يصعد الى ساحه المدفن في الاعلى. ويتكون المدفن من صاله مربعه الشكل بطول نحو 19 مترا. وكانت القبور في الجزء الخلفي للمدفن، ولكنه حُول الى كنيسه في القرن الخامس الميلادي. وتوجد كتابه يونانيه تذكر ان تحويل المكان الى كنيسه عام 447 ومكتوب ذلك على الجزء الخلفي الايسر من الجدار.\n\nالمعبد الكبير\nوهو اضخم المباني في مدينه البتراء، ويقع هذا المعبد على الجهه الجنوبيه من الشارع المُعمد. ويتكون البناء من مدخل رئيسي يرتبط مع الشارع، ثم ساحه مقدسه سفلى وعلى جانبيها يوجد بنائين متطابقين على شكل نصف دائري وعلى جانبيهما توجد ادراج عريضه تؤدي الى الساحه العليا المقدسه، وفوقها يقع المعبد او قدس الاقداس.\n\nالمذبح\nاُستخدم هذا المبنى في فتره الصليبيين ليكون صله وصل وربط ما بين قلعتي الوعيره والحبيس. اما المذبح نفسه، فاصوله ادوميه. وبعد الاحتفالات التي كانت تجرى في المدرج كانت المواكب الدينيه تصعد الى المذبح من المنطقه المجاوره للمدرج مرورًا بوادي المحافر حتى تصل للمذبح حيث تقدم القرابين التي كانت حيوانيه والمذبح يتكون من ساحه مركزيه محاطه بمقاعد من ثلاث جهات. ان اول ما يمكن رؤيته في هذه المنطقه هو مسلتان مقطوعتان في الصخر ويعتقد بانهما يرمزان لاهم الهه الانباط ذو الشرى ورفيقته الدائمه العزى. كما يُشاهد في منطقه الدرج الصاعد للمذبح بقايا جدران وبرج يُعتقد بان اساساته ادوميه اعيد استخدامه في الفتره النبطيه. ويوجد في الجهه الغربيه مذبحين احدهما مستطيل الشكل ربما استخدم لعمليه الطواف، والاخر دائري الشكل يُعتقد انه كان يستخدم لوضع دماء القرابين او النبيذ كما يحتوي هذا المعلم على بركه او خزان ماء صغير ويمكن مشاهده الجزء السفلي للمدينه من هذا الموقع.\n\nمواقع اخرى\nيوجد المدينه الكثير من المعالم الاخرى ذات الوظائف المختلفه، منها ضريح الجندي الروماني وقاعه الاحتفالات الجنائزيه. ويعتقد بوجود ساحه مركزيه بين هذين المعلمين. اما القاعه الجنائزيه فقد تميزت عن غيرها بوجود دعامات منحوته وملتصقه بالجدران وحنى مستطيله طوليه الشكل خلف المقاعد مباشرهً، اما ضريح الجندي الروماني فربما اُعيد استخدامه بعد 106 م وذلك لوجود ثلاثه تماثيل ذات رداء عسكري روماني موضوعه في حنايا هذه الواجهه.\nكما تحوي البتراء عددًا من المعابد الصغيره في البتراء مثل معبد الاسود المجنحه، ومعبد البستان. بالنسبه لمعبد الاسود المجنحه، فيقع على الجهه المقابله لمبنى قصر البنت، ويتكون بناء المعبد من شرفه اماميه تتقدمها الاعمده بطول 9,5 متر. ويجري الدخول منها عبر بوابه عريضه الى قاعه المعبد الرئيسيه وهي مربعه الشكل وتحيط بها الاعمده. وكانت تاجيات بعض اعمده المعبد تحمل اسودًا مجنحهً ومن هنا جاءت تسميه المعبد. وقد بُلطت ارضيه القاعه الرئيسه برخام ابيض مموج بالبني بينما بلطت المنصه بالرخام الابيض والاسود وزخرفت جدران المعبد الداخليه بالرخام والقصاره الملونه والجض وعثر على قطع جصيه باشكال رؤوس ادميه واقنعه مسرحيه واشكال ازهار كانت مثبته على الجدران. وقد دُمر المعبد والمنشات المحيطه به بزلزال عام 363 م. اما بالنسبه لمعبد البستان، فيتميز بوجود جدار ضخم بجواره يقوم عليه الجزء الجنوبي للشرفه العلويه وبقايا غرف يبدو ان احداها كانت معقوده يتخلل جدرانها احدى عشر حنيه.\nومن المباني الجنائزيه الاخرى في المدينه، قبر المسلات، مدفن الحرير، مدفن سكستوس فلورنتينوس، قبر القصر، القبر الكورنثي،  وقبر الرينيسانس.\n\nالسكان\nبلغ عدد سكان لواء البتراء (الذي تشكل مدينه البتراء جزءاً منه) في عام 2009 نحو 28,760 نسمه، معظمهم من البدو. وكانت قبائل من «عرب اللياثنه» قد استوطنت المكان اثناء اعاده اكتشاف الغرب للبتراء في القرن التاسع عشر. كما كانت عشائر مختلفه تسكن البتراء منذ خمسينيات القرن العشرين، كعشائر «العمارين» و «البدول»، حيث كانوا يسكنون في كهوف داخل البتراء حتى عام 1985، حين رحّلتهم الحكومه الاردنيه الى اسكانات خارج المدينه الاثريه كبلده «البيضاء» التي تبعد عن البترا نحو 10 كم. ويُقدر عددهم من 1,000 - 3,000 شخص يتقن الكثير منهم العديد من اللغات الاجنبيه رغم اميّه الكثير منهم، بسبب اختلاطهم بالسيّاح الاجانب.\nوقد ادرج المجال الثقافي لبدو البتراء ووادي رم في 25 تشرين الثاني/ نوفمبر 2005 الى قائمه اليونسكو لروائع التراث الثقافي اللامادي الانساني. ويقع هذا المجال البدوي الصحراوي قرب مدينه البتراء، داخل منطقه جبليه شبه قاحله ومساحات صحراويه. وهو مجال تمارس فيه مجموعه من الممارسات والمهارات الثقافيه اللاماديه، المرتبطه بالحياه الرعويه التقليديه. فقد حافظ بدو البتراء ووادي الرم على معرفه مميزه في مجال الثروه النباتيه والحيوانيه، وفي حقل الطب التقليدي، وتربيه الجمال وحياكه الخيام والترحال وتسلّق الجبال. وهو ما يقع تناقله عبر الاجيال شفويا وبالممارسه. بالاضافه الى غيرها من الاشكال الثقافيه كالاساطير والشعر والحكايات الشعبيه والاغاني.\n\nالنشاط الاقتصادي\nشكّل معدن النحاس، عصب الحياه الاقتصاديه وعنصرًا هامًا في تدعيم نفوذ وقوه حضاره الانباط. وامتدت اراضي المملكه النبطيه عبر مساحات واسعه، فكان تحت نفوذها اراضي وادي ضانا، حيث اقيم اقدم مناجم للنحاس في العالم، وهي مناجم النحاس في وادي فنان. اضافه الى صناعه الفخار، حيث يعتبر الفخار النبطي من افضل وادق الفخار الذي صنع في العالم، لما عرف من منظر واتقان. وهو رقيق جدًا لدرجه انه يُطلق عليه «قشره البيض».\n\nوقد اشتهر الانباط بالتجاره، وكانت مدينه البتراء محط استراحه للقوافل التجاريه. وهذا ما جعل انتيجونوس - احد قاده الاسكندر المقدوني - بغزو الانباط في عام 312 ق.م. ومع مرور الزمن اصبح الانباط يتمتعون بكيان ونفوذ كبيرين في المنطقه وازدهر فن المعمار والبناء وسك العملات وصناعه الفخار وفنون النحت وغيرها. وتعكس عاصمتهم مدينه البتراء تلك الفنون في اجمل صورها.\n\nاستطاع الانباط تطوير طرق الزراعه الجافه والحصاد المائي، مما يعكس قدره الانسان النبطي على التكيف مع ظروف الحياه الجافه وتطويع الطبيعه، ففنون الزراعه الجافه وطرق الحصاد المائي ما زالت مستخدمه حتى الوقت الحاضر، ومما يجدر ذكره ان العديد من العلماء الغربين استطاعوا نقل التقنيات النبطيه القديمه والمستخدمه في الزراعه الجافه والحصاد المائي ويرجع الفضل بهذا حقيقه الى الانباط.\nاما حاليًا، فتُعتبر البتراء اهم المواقع السياحيه جذبًا للسياح على مستوى الاردن، وبذا لها عائد اقتصادي كبير على البلاد. كما تشكل البتراء اليوم، عمق الاردن الحضاري، وجانبًا هامًا من مضمون مزيج الهويه التاريخيه لهذا البلد. كما تحتل هذه المدينه التاريخيه اليوم، المرتبه الاولى اردنيًا من حيث خلق العماله المحليه ومنطقه جذب سياحي للمشاريع المحليه المدره للدخل ومنطقه جذب للقطاع الخاص، كما انها شكلت فئه متوسطه بالنسبه للبيئه والمشاريع الحكوميه.\n\nالسياحه\nتضم البتراء عددًا كبيرًا من الفنادق ذات تصنيف خمس نجوم وما دون لاستيعاب الاعداد الكبيره من الزائرين لمحميه الاثار في المدينه، حيث بلغ عددهم قرابه 480,000 زائر في عام 1999، فيما ارتفع العدد الى 900,000 عام 2010. كما تحوي هذه المحميه بدورها على عدد كبير من الاسواق الشرقيه. من الجدير بالذكر ان جرش تلي مدينه البتراء من حيث عدد الزوار، تليهما كل من المناطق التاليه تنازليًا: عجلون ومادبا والكرك وام قيس ووادي رم. في عام 2019، احتفلت المدينه باستقبال الزائر رقم مليون لاول مره في تاريخها، في حدث اعتُبر محطه فارقه في مسيره السياحه الاردنيه. وقد نُظمت فعاليات احتفاليه بهذه المناسبه.\nمن جهه اخرى، افتتح في نيسان/ ابريل 1994 متحف البتراء النبطي في المدينه الى جانب متحف اخر هو متحف البتراء القديم، الذي تاسس عام 1963. ويحتوي المتحف النبطي ما يقارب 600 قطعه اثريه معروضه في خزائن العرض؛ حيث يتالف من ثلاث قاعات رئيسيه: القاعه الاولى تشتمل شرحاً عن تاريخ الانباط وجيولوجيه البتراء، بالاضافه الى قطع اثريه تعود الى العصر الحجري الحديث. اما القاعه الثانيه، فهي مخصصه للمكتشفات من الحفريات الاثريه، ومرتبه حسب تسلسلها الزمني بدءاً من العصرالحجري وحتى القرن السادس الميلادي. كما تضم هذه القاعه نبذه تاريخيه عن الزلازل والتجاره النبطيه وطرق القوافل والبتراء في العصور الوسطى. اما القاعه الثالثه، فتحتوي على مجموعه من الاسرجه الفخاريه حسب تطور صناعتها، والتماثيل البرونزيه والفخاريه والاطبـاق الملونه والعاديه وقطع العملات، والحلي والمجوهرات، بالاضافه لبعض القطع الفخاريه والجرار المختلفه الاحجام.\nيُقام في البتراء سنويًا ومنذ عام 2005، مهرجان البتراء السياحي الثقافي، لتشجيع السياحه الداخليه والعربيه. كما اُقيم في نفس العام مؤتمر للحائزين على جائزه نوبل في العالم. ولقد قامت سلطه اقليم البترا بالتعاون مع هيئه تنشيط السياحه في عام 2012، باحياء احتفاليات تضم العديد من الانشطه والفعاليات، بمناسبه مرور 200 عامًا على اكتشاف البتراء، والتي تهدف الى تعريف المواطن المحلي والسائح العربي والاجنبي باهميه هذه المناسبه ودورها الريادي في وضع البتراء على خارطه السياحه العالميه.\n\nاهميه دينيه\nللمدينه اهميه دينيه وتاريخيه للديانات الابراهيميه الثلاث. يعتقد اليهود انها تحتوي على اهم واثمن سر في تاريخهم، وهو تابوت العهد، الذي يحتوي على الوصايا العشر التي اعطاها الله لموسى، بالاضافه الى وجود عصا هارون فيه. يوجد مقام هارون في البتراء وعلى احد قممها المطلّه على المدينه الاثريه بارتفاع 1353 متر عن سطح البحر، مقام النبي هارون . وهو مسجد مملوكي صغير، ذو غرفه مُزينه باقمشه خضراء تعلوها قبه بيضاء وامامه حجر اسود. بُني المقام في سياق اهتمام المماليك بالمقامات والقبور. كما يدعي بعض اليهود انهم هم من بنو البتراء، حيث يعتقدون ان التوراه قد اشارت الى ان من انشا هذه المدينه هم سلاله النبي «نابوت» الابن الاكبر للنبي اسماعيل. كما يعتقدون ان اسم البتراء القديم «سالع» هو كلمه عبريه معناها «صخره»، حيث انها تُرجمت في العدد الثالث من نبوه عوبديا: «تكبر قلبك قد خدعك ايها الساكن في محاجئ الصخر». ويرجحون انها حيثما تذكر في التوراه، فانها تشير الى عاصمه ادوم، المدينه الحصينه في وادي موسى التي اشتهرت باسم «البتراء» (والتي تعني «صخره» باللغه اليونانيه). وبقد بدا اليهود بزياره البتراء بشكل ملحوظ، بعد اتفاقيه وادي عربه.\nمن جهه اخرى، ذُكر مقام هارون بالبتراء ايضًا في مخطوطات الكنيسه البيزنطيه التي تعود الى القرن السادس الميلادي باسم «دير نبينا هارون»، حيث يوجد في المدينه اثار لعدد من الكنائس البيزنطيه ذات الارضيات الفسيفسائيه. وتُعتبر كنيسه البتراء الرئيسيه، ثاني كنيسه في البتراء بعد تحويل قبر الجره (المحكمه) لكنيسه في عام 446. وتتكون الكنيسه من مبنى ذو 3 اروقه، بالاضافه الى ساحه وبرج من الجهه الغربيه وغرف جانبيه من الشمال والشرق.\nكما كان اهالي وادي موسى المسلمون يقومون بزياره المقام منذ زمن بعيد، حيث كان للمكان طقوسا ومناسك تُؤدى. وقد زار الظاهر بيبرس وكاتبه النويري المقام سنه 1276، ولم يتحدث النويري عن وجود بناء فوقه. اما اليوم، فيشهد فوقه مسجدًا صغيرًا كُتب على مدخله عباره تفيد انه عماره هذا المسجد قد جددت في عهد السلطان الملك الناصر محمد بن قلاوون. وقد زار المقام الرحّاله السويسري بيركهارت عام 1812 عندما اراد ان يزور البتراء ، فتذرّع بزياره المقام واخذ معه قربانًا ليتمكن من زياره البتراء. ثم ذهل مما راه عندما دخل البتراء من السيق.\n\nالبتراء في الفن\nاصبح المجتمع الغربي على علم بوجود البتراء اساسًا من خلال قصص جون وليام برغن الدينيه، حين وصفها بانها «مدينه ورديه قديمه بقدم الزمن». لكنه نفسه، مثل كثير من معاصريه، لم يقوموا بزياره البتراء ابدًا. حيث كانوا يعلمون عن البتراء عبر رسومات الليثوغرافيا التي رسمها الفنان الاسكتلندي ديفيد روبرتس للبتراء ومنطقه وادي موسى اثناء زيارته عام 1839، والتي تجاوز عددها عشرين لوحه ليثوغرافيه. وقد طبع العديد منها ما اعطى البتراء شهره عالميه . وقد نشرها في كتابه «مصر وسوريا وفلسطين» في عام 1839. في الواقع، حتى الحرب العالميه الاولى، لم تكن زياره المدينه متاحه للاوروبيين الا برفقه مرشدين محليين ومرافقين مسلحين . ويوجد للبتراء العديد من اللوحات والصور الاخرى التي تعود للقرن التاسع عشر مما يدل على مدى الاهتمام الذي اضفاه اعاده اكتشافها على اوروبا في ذلك الوقت. من الاعمال المشهوره للبتراء، لوحه فنيه بالالوان المائيه لمناظر البتراء للفنان شرانز نحو 1840 . واول خارطه مخطوطه للبتراء باللغه الانجليزيه من رسم الرحاله لابودي نحو عام 1830، وصور من تصوير فريت عام 1830.\nفي عام 1868، شُكلت قافله من الرسامين الفرنسيين للذهاب الى سيناء والفيوم والبتراء، لكن النتيجه كانت مخيبه للامال، حيث منعتهم الامطار الغزيره من اكمال رحلتهم. كتب الفنان البلجيكي تانتان Tintin كتابًا مصورًا عن البتراء، ولكن موقع الصور لم يكن فيه الاردن، حيث كان في دوله افتراضيه اسماها \"Khemed74\".\nوقد احتفت الكثير من المسرحيات والاعمال الدراميه الاردنيه والعربيه بالبتراء، كان من اهمها مسرحيه بترا، التي الّفها الاخوان رحباني، وغنتها فيروز ونصري شمس الدين واخرين.\nكما اختيرت البتراء موقعًا لتصوير عدد من الافلام الامريكيه والعالميه مثل افلام انديانا جونز والحمله الاخيره (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) والعاطفه في الصحراء (Passion in the Desert) والمتحوّلون (Transformers)، وغيرها.\n\nتوامه المدن\nماتيرا، ايطاليا\n بلوفديف،
