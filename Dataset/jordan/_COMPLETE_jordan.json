          "content": "Amman is the capital and the largest city of Jordan, and the country's economic, political, and cultural center. With a population of five million as of 2024, Amman is Jordan's primate city and is the largest city in the Levant region, the fifth-largest city in the Arab world, and the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East.\nAmman is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman dates to the 8th millennium BC in 'Ain Ghazal, home to the world's oldest statues of the human form. During the Iron Age, the city was known as Rabat Aman, the capital of the Ammonite Kingdom. In the 3rd century BC, the city was renamed Philadelphia and became one of the ten Greco-Roman cities of the Decapolis. Later, in the 7th century AD, the Rashidun Caliphate renamed the city Amman. Throughout most of the Islamic era, the city alternated between periods of devastation and periods of relative prosperity. Amman was largely abandoned during the Ottoman period from the 15th century until 1878, when it was resettled by Circassians. The city grew after it was connected to the Hejaz Railway in 1904, leading to the formation of its first municipal council in 1909.\nAmman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan's capital in 1921, receiving migrations from different Jordanian and Levantine cities, and later several successive waves of refugees: Palestinians in 1948 and 1967; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003; and Syrians since 2011. It was initially built on seven hills, but now spans over 19 hills combining 22 areas, which are administered by the Greater Amman Municipality. Areas of Amman have gained their names from either the hills (jabal) or the valleys (wadi) they occupy, such as Jabal al-Luweibdeh and Wadi Abdoun. East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities, while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city.\nApproximately one million visitors arrived in Amman in 2018, which made it the 89th most-visited city in the world and the 12th most-visited Arab city. Amman has a relatively fast growing economy and it is ranked as a Beta− global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Moreover, it was named one of the Middle East and North Africa's best cities according to economic, labor, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. The city is among the most popular locations in the Arab world for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices, alongside Doha and only behind Dubai. Amman has a bus network, including a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system that serves the city and connects it to neighboring Zarqa.\n\nEtymology\nAmman derives its name from the ancient people of the Ammonites, whose capital the city had been since the 13th century BC. The Ammonites named it Rabat ʿAmmān (𐤓𐤁𐤕 𐤏𐤌𐤍), with the term Rabat meaning the \"Capital\" or the \"King's Quarters\". In the Hebrew Bible, the town is referred to as Rabbaṯ Bənē ʿAmmōn (רַבַּת בְּנֵי עַמּוֹן) or simply Rabbā (רַבָּה), and it appears in English translations as \"Rabbah of the Ammonites,\" \"Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, or \"Rabbath Ammon.\" Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the Macedonian ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom who reigned from 283 to 246 BC, renamed the city Philadelphia (Ancient Greek: Φιλαδέλφεια; literally: \"brotherly love\"), after himself, after occupying it. By the Islamic era, the Rashidun Caliphate restored its ancient Semitic name and called it Amman in the 7th century AD.\n\nHistory\nNeolithic period\nThe Neolithic site of ʿAin Ghazal today lies in the outskirts of Amman. At its height, around 7000 BC (9000 years ago), it had an area of 15 hectares (37 acres) and was inhabited by ca. 3000 people (four to five times the population of contemporary Jericho). At that time, the site was a typical aceramic Neolithic village. Its houses were rectangular mud-bricked buildings that included a main square living room, whose walls were made up of lime plaster. The site was discovered in 1974 as construction workers were working on a road crossing the area. By 1982, when the excavations started, around 600 meters (2,000 feet) of road ran through the site. Despite the damage brought by urban expansion, the remains of ʿAin Ghazal provided a wealth of information.\nʿAin Ghazal is well known for a set of small human statues found in 1983, when local archeologists stumbled upon the edge of a large pit containing them. These statues are human figures made with white plaster, with painted eyes. Thirty-two figures were found in two caches, fifteen of them full figures, fifteen busts, and two fragmentary heads. Three of the busts depicted two-headed characters, the significance of which is not clear.\n\nIron Age: the Ammonites\nIn the 13th century BC, Amman was the capital of the Ammonite Kingdom, and became known as \"Rabat Amman\". Rabat Amman provided several natural resources to the region, including sandstone and limestone, along with a productive agricultural sector that made it a vital location along the King's Highway, the ancient trade route connecting Egypt with Mesopotamia, Syria and Anatolia. As with the Edomites and Moabites, trade along this route gave the Ammonites considerable revenue. Milcom is named in the Hebrew Bible as the national god of Rabat Amman. Another ancient deity, Moloch, usually associated with the use of children as offerings, is also mentioned in the Bible as a god of the Ammonites, but this is probably a mistake for Milcom. However, excavations by archeologists near Amman Civil Airport uncovered a temple, which included an altar containing many human bone fragments. The bones showed evidence of burning, which led to the assumption that the altar functioned as a pyre and used for human sacrifice.\nAmman is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible. According to the biblical narrative, the Ammonite king Hanun allied with Hadadezer, king of Aram-Zobah, against the United Kingdom of Israel. During the war, Joab, the captain of King David's army, laid siege to Rabbah, Hanun's royal capital, and destroyed it (2 Samuel 12:26–28, 1 Chronicles 20:1–2). David took a great quantity of plunder from the city, including the king's crown, and brought it to his capital, Jerusalem (2 Samuel 12:29–31). Hanun's brother, Shobi, was made king in his place, and became a loyal vassal of David (2 Samuel 17:27). Hundreds of years later, the prophet Jeremiah foresaw the coming destruction and final desolation of the city (Jeremiah 49:2).\nSeveral Ammonite ruins across Amman exist, such as Rujm Al-Malfouf and some parts of the Amman Citadel. The ruins of Rujm Al-Malfouf consist of a stone watchtower used to ensure the protection of their capital and several store rooms to the east. The city was later conquered by the Assyrians, followed by the Babylonians and the Achaemenid Persians.\n\nClassical and late antiquity\nHellenistic period\nConquest of the Near East by Alexander the Great firmly consolidated the influence of Hellenistic culture, marking the start of the Hellenistic period. Little is known about Greek/Macedonian control over the Levantine coast and Transjordan until 301 BCE, 22 years after Alexander's death, when the Ptolemies took control over this area. The Greeks founded new cities in the area of modern-day Jordan, including Gadara (Umm Qays), Gerasa (Jerash), Pella (Tabaqat Fahl) and Philadelphia (Amman). Ptolemy II nicknamed Philadelphus, the Macedonian ruler of Egypt, established in or before 259/58 BCE at the site of Amman what was initially probably a military colony, which then developed into a full-blown Greek-type polis, possibly by settling there Hellenised Tyrean colonists. Ptolemy II named it Philadelphia (Ancient Greek: Φιλαδέλφεια, romanized: Philadelpheia), evoking \"brotherly love\" in Greek, in adulation to his own nickname.\nWritten sources speak of members of the Jewish Tobiad family based in Jerusalem, who worked for the Ptolemies as tax collectors in charge of the entire region. The last known Tobiad, Hyrcanus, built the unique Hellenistic palace of Tyros (today's Qasr al-Abd, 'Castle of the Slave') southwest of Philadelpheia, before killing himself in c. 170-168 BC as the Seleucid king Antiochus IV seemed poised to attack him. This was one of several episodes in the Syrian Wars between the Seleucids and the Ptolemies, ending with the 200 BCE victory of the Seleucids at the Battle of Panium. In 218/17 BCE for instance, Seleucid king Antiochus III destroyed the Ptolemaic garrisons in the centre of Transjordan, capturing Philadelpheia in the process. Even after 200 BCE, Philadelpheia seems to have broken free at times from Seleucid rule and probably also escaped capture by Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaios (r. c. 103 – c. 76 BCE), who was more successful elsewhere in the region. Other Hasmonean and Nabataean rulers acted as regional power brokers, contributing to the instability of the political situation during the 2nd century BCE and until the advent of the Roman period in the following century, which led to the Hellenisation of the region only truly setting in under the Romans.\n\nRoman period\nThe Romans conquered much of the Levant in 63 BC, inaugurating a period of imperial rule conducted from Rome that lasted for four centuries. In the northern parts of modern-day Jordan, the Greek cities of Philadelphia (Amman), Gerasa, Gedara, Pella and Arbila joined with other cities in Palestine and southern parts of today's Syria to form the Decapolis League, a confederation based on common economic and cultural interests (see also Scythopolis, Hippos, Capitolias, Canatha and Damascus). Philadelphia became a point along a road stretching from Ailah to Damascus that was built by Emperor Trajan in AD 106. This provided an economic boost for the city in a short period of time.\nThere are traces of Roman construction all across Jordan. In Amman the most conspicuous structures include the Great Temple (inaccurately known as the \"Temple of Hercules\") at the Amman Citadel, the Roman Theatre, the Odeon, and the Nymphaeum. The two theaters and the nymphaeum fountain were built during the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius around AD 161. The theatre was the larger venue of the two and had a capacity for 6,000 attendees. It was oriented north and built into the hillside, to protect the audience from the sun. To the northeast of the theatre was a small odeon. Built at roughly the same time as the theatre, the Odeon had 500 seats and is still in use today for music concerts. Archaeologists speculate that the structure was originally covered with a wooden roof to shield the audience from the weather. The Nymphaeum is situated southwest of the Odeon and served as Philadelphia's chief fountain. The Nymphaeum is believed to have contained a 600 square meters (6,500 sq ft) pool which was 3 meters (9.8 ft) deep and was continuously refilled with water.\n\nByzantine period\nDuring the late Byzantine period in the seventh century, several bishops were based in the city; a number of church sites from the Byzantine period have been discovered there - see List of Byzantine churches in Amman.\n\nEarly Muslim period (7th–11th century)\nIn the 630s, the Rashidun Caliphate conquered the region from the Byzantines, beginning the Islamic era in the Levant. Philadelphia was renamed \"Amman\" by the Muslims and became part of the district of Jund Dimashq. A large part of the population already spoke Arabic, which facilitated integration into the caliphate, as well as several conversions to Islam. Under the Umayyad caliphs who began their rule in 661 AD, numerous desert castles were established as a means to govern the desert area of modern-day Jordan, several of which are still well-preserved. Amman had already been functioning as an administrative centre. The Umayyads built a large palace on the Amman Citadel hill, known today as the Umayyad Palace. Amman was later destroyed by several earthquakes and natural disasters, including a particularly severe earthquake in 749. The Umayyads were overthrown by the Abbasids three years later.\nAmman's importance declined by the mid-8th century after damage caused by several earthquakes rendered it uninhabitable. Excavations among the collapsed layer of the Umayyad Palace have revealed remains of kilns from the time of the Abbasids (750–969) and the Fatimids (969–1099). In the late 9th century, Amman was noted as the \"capital\" of the Balqa by geographer al-Yaqubi. Likewise, in 985, the Jerusalemite historian al-Muqaddasi described Amman as the capital of Balqa, that it was a town in the desert fringe of Syria surrounded by villages and cornfields and a regional source of lambs, grain and honey. Its inhabitants he reports, at the time, were Shia Muslims. Furthermore, al-Muqaddasi describes Amman as a \"harbor of the desert\" where Arab Bedouin would take refuge, and that its citadel, which overlooked the town, contained a small mosque.\n\nCrusaders and Ayyubids (12th–13th century)\nThe occupation of the Citadel Hill by the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem is so far based only on interpretations of Crusader sources. William of Tyre writes in his Historia that in 1161 Philip of Milly received the castle of Ahamant, which is seen to refer to Amman, as part of the lordship of Oultrejordain. In 1166 Philip joined the military order of the Knights Templar, passing on to them a significant part of his fief including the castle of Ahamant or \"Haman\", as it is named in the deed of confirmation issued by King Amalric. By 1170, Amman was in Ayyubid hands. The remains of a watch tower on Citadel Hill, first attributed to the Crusaders, now are preferentially dated to the Ayyubid period, leaving it to further research to find the location of the Crusader castle. During the Ayyubid period, the Damascene geographer al-Dimashqi wrote that Amman was part of the province of al-Karak, although \"only ruins\" remained of the town.\n\nMamluk period (13th–early 16th century)\nDuring the Mamluk era (late 13th–early 16th century), the region of Amman was a part of Wilayat Balqa, the southernmost district of Mamlakat Dimashq (Damascus Province). The capital of the district in the first half of the 14th century was the minor administrative post of Hisban, which had a considerably smaller garrison than the other administrative centers in Transjordan, namely Ajlun and al-Karak.  In 1321, the geographer Abu'l Fida, recorded that Amman was \"a very ancient town\" with fertile soil and surrounded by agricultural fields. For unclear, though likely financial reasons, in 1356, the capital of Balqa was transferred from Hisban to Amman, which was considered a madina (city). In 1357, Emir Sirghitmish bought Amman in its entirety, most likely to use revenues from the city to help fund the Madrasa of Sirghitmish, which he built in Cairo that same year. After his purchase of the city, Sirghitmish transferred the courts, administrative bureaucracy, markets and most of the inhabitants of Hisban to Amman. Moreover, he financed new building works in the city.\nOwnership of Amman following Sirghitmish's death in 1358 passed to successive generations of his descendants until 1395, when his descendants sold it to Emir Baydamur al-Khwarazmi, the na'ib as-saltana (viceroy) of Damascus. Afterward, part of Amman's cultivable lands were sold to Emir Sudun al-Shaykhuni (died 1396), the na'ib as-saltana of Egypt. The increasingly frequent division and sale of the city and lands of Amman to different owners signalled declining revenues coming from Amman, while at the same time, Hisban was restored as the major city of the Balqa in the 15th century. From then until 1878, Amman was an abandoned site periodically used to shelter seasonal farmers who cultivated arable lands in its vicinity and by Bedouin tribes who used its pastures and water. The Ottoman Empire annexed the region of Amman in 1516, but for much of the Ottoman period, al-Salt functioned as the virtual political center of Transjordan.\n\nModern era (1878–present)\nLate Ottoman period (1878–1917)\nAmman began to be resettled in 1878, when several hundred Muslim Circassians arrived following their expulsion from the North Caucasus by the Russian Empire during the events of the Russo-Circassian War. Between 1878 and 1910, tens of thousands of Circassians became refugees in the Ottoman Empire, which had moved large numbers of them into its province of Syria. The Ottoman authorities directed the Circassians, who were mainly of peasant stock, to settle in Amman, and distributed arable land among them. Their settlement was a partial manifestation of the Ottoman statesman Kamil Pasha's project, which did not materialize, to establish the Amman Province (vilayet) which, along with other sites in its vicinity, would become Circassian-populated townships guaranteeing the security of the Damascus–Medina highway. The first Circassian settlers, who belonged to the Shapsug tribe, lived near Amman's Roman theater and incorporated its stones into the houses they built. The English traveller Laurence Oliphant noted in his 1879 visit that most of the original Circassian settlers had left Amman by then, with about 150 remaining. They were joined by Circassians from the Kabardian and Abzakh tribes in 1880–1892.\n\nUntil 1900 settlement was concentrated in the valley and slopes of the Amman stream and settlers built mud-brick houses with wooden roofs. The French Dominican priest Marie-Joseph Lagrange commented in 1890 about Amman: \"A mosque, the ancient bridges, all that jumbled with the houses of the Circassians gives Amman a remarkable physiognomy\". The new village became a nahiye (subdistrict) center of the kaza of al-Salt in the Karak Sanjak established in 1894. By 1908 Amman contained 800 houses divided between three main quarters, Shapsug, Kabartai and Abzakh, each called after the Circassian groupings which respectively settled there, a number of mosques, open-air markets, shops, bakeries, mills, a textile factory, a post and telegraph office and a government compound (saraya). Kurdish settlers formed their own quarter called \"al-Akrad\" after them, while a number of townspeople from nearby al-Salt and al-Fuheis, seeking to avoid high taxes and conscription or attracted by financial incentives, and traders from Najd and Morocco, had also moved to the town.\n\nThe city's demographics changed dramatically after the Ottoman government's decision to construct the Hejaz Railway, which linked Damascus and Medina, and facilitated the annual Hajj pilgrimage and trade. Operational in central Transjordan since 1903, the Hejaz Railway helped to transform Amman from a small village into a major commercial hub in the region. Circassian entrepreneurship, facilitated by the railway, helped to attract investment from merchants from Damascus, Nablus, and Jerusalem, many of whom moved to Amman in the 1900s and 1910s. Some of the Arab families who arrived from surrounding regions during this period include Hudhud, Malas, Idlibi, Bdeir, Haddad, and Kawar. Although they settled after the local Circassian population and Bedouins of Jordan, they earned the nickname 'Founding Families of Amman' for establishing key institutions such as pharmacies and construction firms, and for bringing goods and expertise from their more developed cities of origion. Amman's first municipal council was established in 1909, and Circassian Ismael Babouk was elected as its mayor.\n\nFirst World War\nThe First and Second Battle of Amman were part of the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I and the Arab Revolt, taking place in 1918. Amman had a strategic location along the Hejaz Railway; its capture by British forces and the Hashemite Arab army facilitated the British advance towards Damascus. The second battle was won by the British, resulting in the establishment of the British Mandate.\n\nBritish Mandate; Emirate of Transjordan (1921–1946)\nIn 1921, the Hashemite emir and later king Abdullah I designated Amman instead of al-Salt to be the capital of the newly created state, the Emirate of Transjordan, which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1950. Its function as the capital of the country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the Jordan River at the time. The early settlers who came from Palestine were overwhelmingly from Nablus, from which many of al-Salt's inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus. Amman later attracted people from the southern part of the country, particularly al-Karak and Madaba. The city's population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.\nThe British report from 1933 shows around 1,700 Circassians living in Amman. Yet the community was far from insulated. Local urban and nomadic communities formed alliances with the Circassians, some of which are still present today. This cemented the status of Circassians in the re-established city.\n\nPost-independence (1946–present)\nJordan gained its independence in 1946 and Amman was designated the country's capital. Amman received many refugees during wartime events in nearby countries, beginning with the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. A second wave arrived after the Six-Day War in 1967. In 1970, Amman was a battlefield during the conflict between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Jordanian Army known as Black September. The Jordanian Army defeated the PLO in 1971, and the latter were expelled to Lebanon. The first wave of Iraqi refugees settled in the city after the 1991 Gulf War, with a second wave occurring in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nOn 9 November 2005, Al-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's leadership launched coordinated explosions in three hotel lobbies in Amman, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. Jordan's security as a whole was dramatically improved after the attack, and no major terrorist attacks have been reported since then. Most recently a wave of Syrian refugees have arrived in the city during the ongoing Syrian Civil War which began in 2011. Amman was a principal destination for refugees for the security and prosperity it offered.\nDuring the 2010s, the city has experienced an economic, cultural and urban boom. The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation, and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace. This strained Jordan's scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers of quick expansion without careful municipal planning.\n\nGeography\nAmman is situated on the East Bank Plateau, an upland characterized by three major wadis which run through it. Originally, the city had been built on seven hills. Amman's terrain is typified by its mountains. The most important areas in the city are named after the hills or mountains they lie on. The area's elevation ranges from 700 to 1,100 m (2,300 to 3,600 ft). Al-Salt and al-Zarqa are located to the northwest and northeast, respectively, Madaba is located to the west, and al-Karak and Ma'an are to Amman's southwest and southeast, respectively. One of the only remaining springs in Amman now supplies the Zarqa River with water. Trees found in Amman include Aleppo pine, Mediterranean cypress and Phoenician juniper.\n\nClimate\nAmman features a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa) in its western and northern neighborhoods, while its eastern and southern neighborhoods experience a semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh/BSk).\nThe summer season in Amman is moderately long, characterized by mild heat and refreshing breezes. However, occasional heatwaves may occur during this period. Spring is brief yet warm, with temperatures reaching highs of 28 °C (82 °F). This season typically commences between April and May, lasting for about a month. Winter usually sets in around the end of November, extending through early to mid-March. During winter, temperatures typically hover around or below 17 °C (63 °F), with sporadic snowfall occurring once or twice a year.\nThe average annual rainfall in Amman is around 385 mm (15 in), with great variations between different parts of the city. The western areas receive more than 500 mm (20 in) of rainfall, whereas the eastern areas receive less than 250 mm (10 in). Rainfall primarily occurs between November and April, and periodic droughts are not uncommon.\nAmman experiences heavy fog on about 120 days each year. The city's diverse weather conditions are heavily influenced by differences in elevation. While snow might accumulate in the higher-altitude western and northern regions of Amman (with an average altitude of 1,000 m or 3,300 ft above sea level), the city center (at an elevation of 700 m or 2,300 ft) might experience rainfall simultaneously. This variation in elevation leads to extreme microclimates within Amman, with each district having its own distinct weather patterns.\n\nLocal government\nAmman is governed by a 41-member city council elected directly for terms of four years. All Jordanian citizens above 18 years old are eligible to vote in the municipal elections. However, the mayor is appointed by the king and not through elections. In 1909 a city council was established in Amman by Circassian Ismael Babouk who became the first-ever mayor of the capital, and in 1914 Amman's first city district center was founded.\nThe Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) has been investing in making the city a better place, through a number of initiatives. Green Amman 2020 was initiated in 2014, aiming to turn the city to a green metropolis by 2020. According to official statistics, only 2.5% of Amman is green space. In 2015 GAM and Zain Jordan started operating free-of-charge Wi-Fi services at 15 locations, including Wakalat Street, Rainbow Street, The Hashemite Plaza, Ashrafieh Cultural Complex, Zaha Cultural Center, Al Hussein Cultural Center, Al Hussein Public Parks and others.\n\nAdministrative divisions\nJordan is divided into twelve administrative divisions, each called a governorate. Amman Governorate divides into nine districts, five of which are divided into sub-districts. The Greater Amman Municipality has 22 areas which are further divided into neighborhoods.\nThe city is administered as the Greater Amman Municipality and covers 22 areas which include:\n\nEconomy\nBanking sector\nThe banking sector is one of the principal foundations of Jordan's economy. Despite the unrest and economic difficulties in the Arab world resulting from the Arab Spring uprisings, Jordan's banking sector maintained its growth in 2014. The sector consists of 25 banks, 15 of which are listed on the Amman Stock Exchange. Amman is the base city for the international Arab Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East, serving clients in more than 600 branches in 30 countries on five continents. Arab Bank represents 28% of the Amman Stock Exchange and is the highest-ranked institution by market capitalization on the exchange.\n\nTourism\nAmman is the fourth most-visited Arab city and the ninth highest recipient of international visitor spending. Roughly 1.8 million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3 billion in the city. The expansion of Queen Alia International Airport is an example of the Greater Amman Municipality's heavy investment in the city's infrastructure. The recent construction of a public transportation system and a national railway, and the expansion of roads, are intended to ease the traffic generated by the millions of annual visitors to the city.\nAmman, and Jordan in general, is the Middle East's hub for medical tourism. Jordan receives the most medical tourists in the region and the fifth highest in the world. Amman receives 250,000 foreign patients a year and over $1 billion annually.\n\nBusiness\nAmman is introducing itself as a business hub. The city's skyline is being continuously transformed through the emergence of new projects. A significant portion of business flowed into Amman following the 2003 Iraq War. Jordan's main airport, Queen Alia International Airport, is located south of Amman and is the hub for the country's national carrier Royal Jordanian, a major airline in the region. The airline is headquartered in Zahran district. Rubicon Group Holding and Maktoob, two major regional information technology companies, are based in Amman, along with major international corporations such as Hikma Pharmaceuticals, one of the Middle East's largest pharmaceutical companies, and Aramex, the Middle East's largest logistics and transportation company.\nIn a report by Dunia Frontier Consultants, Amman, along with Doha, Qatar and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, are the favored hubs for multinational corporations operating in the Middle East and North Africa region. In FDI magazine, Amman was chosen as the Middle Eastern city with the most potential to be a leader in foreign direct investment in the region. Furthermore, several of the world's largest investment banks have offices in Amman including Standard Chartered, Société Générale, and Citibank.\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Amman reached 4,007,526 in 2015; the city contains about 42% of Jordan's entire population. It has a land area of 1,680 km2 (648.7 sq mi) which yields a population density of about 2,380 inhabitants per square kilometer (6,200/sq mi). The population of Amman has risen exponentially with the successive waves of immigrants and refugees arriving throughout the 20th century. From a population of roughly 1,000 in 1890, Amman grew to around 1,000,000 inhabitants in 1990, primarily as a result of immigration, but also due to the high birthrate in the city. Amman had been abandoned for centuries until hundreds of Circassians settled it in the 19th century. Today, about 40,000 Circassians live in Amman and its vicinity. After Amman became a major hub along the Hejaz Railway in 1914, many Muslim and Christian merchant families from al-Salt immigrated to the city. A large proportion of Amman's inhabitants have Palestinian roots (urban or rural origin), and the two main demographic groups in the city today are Arabs of Palestinian or Jordanian descent. Other ethnic groups comprise about 2% of the population. There are no official statistics about the proportion of people of Palestinian or Jordanian descent.\nNew arrivals consisting of Jordanians from the north and south of the country and immigrants from Palestine had increased the city's population from 30,000 in 1930 to 60,000 in 1947. About 10,000 Palestinians, mostly from Safed, Haifa and Acre, migrated to the city for economic opportunities before the 1948 war. Many of the immigrants from al-Salt from that time were originally from Nablus. The 1948 war caused an exodus of urban Muslim and Christian Palestinian refugees, mostly from Jaffa, Ramla and Lydda, to Amman, whose population swelled to 110,000. With Jordan's capture of the West Bank during the war, many Palestinians from that area steadily migrated to Amman between 1950 and 1966, before another mass wave of Palestinian refugees from the West Bank moved to the city during the 1967 War. By 1970, the population had swelled to an estimated 550,000. A further 200,000 Palestinians arrived after their expulsion from Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War. Several large Palestinian refugee camps exist around the center of Amman.\nBecause Amman lacks a deep-rooted native population, the city does not have a distinct Arabic dialect, although recently such a dialect utilizing the various Jordanian and Palestinian dialects, has been forming. The children of immigrants in the city are also increasingly referring to themselves as \"Ammani\", unlike much of the first-generation inhabitants who identify more with their respective places of origin.\n\nReligion\nAmman has a mostly Sunni Muslim population, and the city contains numerous mosques. Among the main mosques is the large King Abdullah I Mosque, built between 1982 and 1989. It is capped by a blue mosaic dome beneath which 3,000 Muslims may offer prayer. The Abu Darweesh Mosque, noted for its checkered black-and-white pattern, has an architectural style that is unique to Jordan. The mosque is situated on Jabal Ashrafieh, the highest point in the city. The mosque's interior is marked by light-colored walls and Persian carpets. During the 2004 Amman Message conference, edicts from various clergy-members afforded the following schools of thought as garnering collective recognition: Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi'i, Ja'fari, Zahiri, Zaydi, Ibadi, tassawuf-related Sufism, Muwahhidism and Salafism. Amman also has a small Druze community.\nLarge numbers of Christians from throughout Jordan, particularly from al-Salt, have moved to Amman. Nearby Fuheis is a predominantly Christian town located to the northwest of the city. A small Armenian Catholic community of around 70 families is present in the city. Ecclesiastical courts for matters of personal status are also located in Amman. A total of 16 historic churches are located in Umm ar-Rasas ruins in Al-Jeezah district; the site is believed to have initially served as Roman fortified military camps which gradually became a town around the 5th century AD. It has not been completely excavated. It was influenced by several civilizations including the Romans, Byzantines and Muslims. The site contains some well-preserved mosaic floors, particularly the mosaic floor of the Church of Saint Stephen.\n\nCityscape\nDowntown Amman, the city center area (known in Arabic as Al-Balad), has been dwarfed by the sprawling urban area that surrounds it. Despite the changes, much remains of its old character. Jabal Amman is a tourist attraction in old Amman, where the city's largest souks, museums, ancient constructions, monuments, and cultural sites are found. Jabal Amman also contains the famous Rainbow Street and the cultural Souk Jara market.\n\nArchitecture\nResidential buildings are limited to four stories above street level and if possible another four stories below, according to the Greater Amman Municipality regulations. The buildings are covered with thick white or beige limestone or sandstone. The buildings usually have balconies on each floor, with the exception of the ground floor, which has a front and back yard. Some buildings make use of Mangalore tiles on the roofs or on the roof of covered porches. Hotels, towers and commercial buildings are either covered by stone, plastic or glass.\n\nHigh-rise construction and towers\nZahran district in west Amman is the location of the Jordan Gate, which is a high class commercial and residential project currently under construction in the Wadi Al-Seer district of Amman, Jordan, it consists of two high-rise buildings connected by a multi-storey podium.\nNew Abdali district hosts a mall, a boulevard along with several hotels, commercial and residential towers. Valued at more than US$5 billion with two main phases, the district created a new visible center for Amman and act as the major business district for the city.\nThe first phase, estimated at more than JD2.4 billion, and receiving about 20 million visitors annually, contains seven Itowers extending over an area of 1.03 million square metres. It attracts about 500 companies operating in 27 sectors, and provided a total of 15,000 job opportunities by 2023.\nA second phase was announced in May 2024, which will cover an area of 1.2 million square meters and is anticipated to create over 3,000 job opportunities each year, were outlined in the statement. This phase involves the construction of a multi-use conference center with a capacity for 25,000 people, as well as two towers that will include hotels, residential apartments, commercial centers, and advanced medical facilities.\n\nCulture\nMuseums\nThe largest museum in Jordan is The Jordan Museum. It contains much of the valuable archeological findings in the country, including some of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Neolithic limestone statues of 'Ain Ghazal, and a copy of the Mesha Stele. Other museums include the Duke's Diwan, Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts, Jordan Archaeological Museum, The Children's Museum Jordan, The Martyrs' Memorial and Museum, the Royal Automobile Museum, the Prophet Mohammad Museum, the Museum of Parliamentary Life, the Jordan Folklore Museum, and museums at the University of Jordan.\n\nLifestyle\nAmman is considered one of the most liberal cities in the Arab world. The city has become one of the most popular destinations for expatriates and college students who seek to live, study, or work in the Middle East or the Arab world in general. The city's culinary scene has changed from its shawarma stands and falafel joints to embrace many popular international restaurants and fast-food outlets such as Asian fusion restaurants, French bistros and Italian trattorias. The city has become famous for its fine dining scene among Western expatriates and Persian Gulf tourists.\n\nLarge shopping malls were built during the 2000s in Amman, including the Mecca Mall, Abdoun Mall, City Mall, Al-Baraka Mall, TAJ Lifestyle Center, Zara Shopping Center, Avenue Mall, and Abdali Mall in Al Abdali. Wakalat Street (\"Agencies Street\") is Amman's first pedestrian-only street and carries a lot of name-label clothes. The Sweifieh area is considered to be the main shopping district of Amman.\nNightclubs, music bars and shisha lounges are present across Amman, changing the city's old image as the conservative capital of the kingdom. This burgeoning new nightlife scene is shaped by Jordan's young population. In addition to the wide range of drinking and dancing venues on the social circuit of the city's affluent crowd, Amman hosts cultural entertainment events, including the annual Amman Summer Festival. Souk Jara is a Jordanian weekly flea market event that occurs every Friday throughout the summer. Sweifieh is considered to be the unofficial red-light district of Amman as it holds most of the city's nightclubs, bars. Jabal Amman and Jabal al-Luweibdeh are home to many pubs and bars as well, making the area popular among bar hoppers.\nAlcohol is widely available in restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and supermarkets. There are numerous nightclubs and bars across the city, especially in West Amman. As of 2011, there were 77 registered nightclubs in Jordan (excluding bars and pubs), overwhelmingly located in the capital city. In 2009, there were 222 registered liquor stores in Amman.\n\nCuisine\nDanielle Pergament of The New York Times described Ammani cuisine as a product of several cuisines in the region, writing that it combines \"the bright vegetables from Lebanon, crunchy falafels from Syria, juicy kebabs from Egypt and, most recently, spicy meat dishes from Jordan's neighbor, Iraq. It's known as the food of the Levant – an ancient word for the area bounded by the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian peninsula. But the food here isn't just the sum of its calories. In this politically, religiously and ethnically fraught corner of the world, it is a symbol of bloodlines and identity.\" However, the city's street food scene makes the Ammani cuisine distinctive.\n\nSports\nAmman-based football clubs Al-Wehdat and Al-Faisaly, both former league champions, share one of the most popular rivalries in the local football scene. Amman hosted the 2016 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup along with Irbid and Zarqa.\nThe 2007 Asian Athletics Championships and more than one edition of the IAAF World Cross Country Championships were held in the city. Amman also hosts the Jordan Rally, which form part of the FIA World Rally Championship, becoming one of the largest sporting events ever held in Jordan.\nAmman is home to a growing number of foreign sports such as skateboarding and rugby; the latter has two teams based in the city: Amman Citadel Rugby Club and Nomads Rugby Club. In 2014, German non-profit organization Make Life Skate Life completed construction of the 7Hills Skatepark, a 650 square meter concrete skatepark located at Samir Rifai park in Downtown Amman.\n\nMedia and music\nThe majority of Jordan's radio stations are based in Amman. The first radio station to originate in the city was Hunna Amman in 1959; it mainly broadcast traditional Bedouin music. In 2000, Amman Net became the first de facto private radio station to be established in the country, despite private ownership of radio stations being illegal at the time. After private ownership was legalized in 2002, several more radio stations were created.\n\nMost Jordanian newspapers and news stations are situated in Amman. Daily newspapers published in Amman include Alghad, Ad-Dustour, The Jordan Times, and Al Ra'i, the most circulated newspaper in the country. In 2011, Al Ra'i was ranked the 5th most popular newspaper in the Arab world by Forbes Middle-East report. Al-Arab Al-Yawm is the only daily pan-Arab newspaper in Jordan. The two most popular Jordanian TV channels, Ro'ya TV and JRTV, are based in Amman.\nAside from mainstream Arabic pop, there is a growing independent music scene in the city which includes many bands that have sizable audiences across the Arab world. Local Ammani bands along with other bands in the Middle East gather in the Roman Theater during the Al-Balad Music Festival held annually in August. Music genres of the local bands are diverse, ranging from heavy metal to Arabic Rock, jazz and rap. Performers include JadaL, Torabyeh, Bilocate, Akher Zapheer, Autostrad and El Morabba3.\n\nEvents\nMany events take place in Amman, including Red Bull-sponsored events Soundclash and Soapbox race, the second part of Jerash Festival, Al-Balad Music Festival, Amman Marathon, Made in Jordan Festival, Amman Book Festival and New Think Festival. Venues for such cultural events often include the Roman and Odeon Theaters downtown, the Ras al Ain Hanger, King Hussein Business Park, Rainbow Theater and Shams Theater, the Royal Film Commission, Shoman libraries and Darat al Funun, and the Royal Cultural Center at Sports City. In addition to large-scale events and institutional planning, scholars point to tactical urbanism as a key element of the city's cultural fabric.\n\nTransportation\nAirports\nThe main airport serving Amman is Queen Alia International Airport, situated about 30 km (18.64 mi) south of Amman. Much smaller is Amman Civil Airport, a one-terminal airport that serves primarily domestic and nearby international routes and the army. Queen Alia International Airport is the major international airport in Jordan and the hub for Royal Jordanian, the flag carrier. Its expansion was recently done and modified, including the decommissioning of the old terminals and the commissioning of new terminals costing $700M, to handle over 16 million passengers annually. It is now considered a state-of-the-art airport and was named 'the best airport in the Middle East' for 2014 and 2015 and 'the best improvement in the Middle East' for 2014 by Airport Service Quality Survey, the world's leading airport passenger satisfaction benchmark program.\n\nRoads\nAmman has an extensive road network. Eight roundabout \"circles\", which formerly marked neighborhoods, are used as landmarks. The road network includes many bridges and tunnels due to the mountainous nature of the terrain. A leading example is the Abdoun Bridge, which spans Wadi Abdoun and connects the 4th Circle to Abdoun Circle. It is considered one of Amman's many landmarks and is the first curved suspended bridge to be built in the country.\n\nSuccessive waves of refugees to the city has led to the rapid construction of new neighborhoods, but Amman's capacity for new or widened roads remains limited despite the influx. This has resulted in increasing traffic jams, particularly during summer when there are large numbers of tourists and Jordanian expatriates visiting. In 2015, a ring road encompassing the city was constructed, which aims to connect the northern and southern parts of the city in order for traffic to be diverted outside Amman and to improve the environmental conditions in the city.\n\nBus and taxi\nThe city has frequent bus connections to other cities in Jordan, as well as to major cities in neighboring countries; the latter are also served by service taxis. Internal transport is served by a number of bus routes and taxis. Service taxis, which most often operate on fixed routes, are readily available and inexpensive. The two main bus and taxi stations are Abdali (near the King Abdullah Mosque, the Parliament and Palace of Justice) and the Raghadan Central Bus Station near the Roman theater in the city center. Popular Jordanian bus company services include JETT and Al-Mahatta. Taxis are the most common way to get around in Amman due their high availability and inexpensiveness.\nThe Amman Bus and the Amman Bus Rapid Transit public transportation systems currently serve the city. Construction work on the BRT system started in 2010, but was halted soon after amid feasibility concerns. Resuming in 2015, the first route of the BRT system was inaugurated in 2021, and the second in 2022. Another BRT route connecting Amman with Zarqa started operations in May 2024.\nThe BRT system in Amman runs on 2 routes: the first from Sweileh in northwest Amman to the Ras Al-Ain area next to downtown Amman, and the second from Sweileh to Mahatta terminal in eastern Amman. Both routes meet at the Sports City intersection. The first route is currently served by three lines: 98, 99 and 100. Ticket price for all lines of Amman Bus and Amman BRT are bought either online via the Amman Bus mobile application or as a rechargeable card in major terminals. Passengers scan their cards or QR codes on phone when boarding the bus, where the price ticket is subtracted from the available balance. The buses are air-conditioned, accessible, monitored with security cameras and have free internet service.\n\nEducation\nAmman is a major regional center of education. The Amman region hosts Jordan's highest concentration of education centers. There are 20 universities in Amman. The University of Jordan is the largest public university in the city. There are 448 private schools in the city attended by 90,000 students, including Jubilee School, Amman Baccalaureate School, Amman Academy, Amman National School, Modern American School, American Community School in Amman, and National Orthodox School.\nUniversities include:\n\nUniversity of Jordan\nAl-Ahliyya Amman University\nAl-Isra University\nAl-Zaytoonah University of Jordan\nAmman Arab University\nApplied Science University\nArab Academy for Banking and Financial Sciences\nArab Open University\nColumbia University: Amman Branch\nGerman-Jordanian University: Amman Branch\nJordan Academy for Maritime Studies\nJordan Academy of Music\nJordan Institute of Banking Studies\nJordan Media Institute\nMiddle East University\nUniversity of Petra\nPhiladelphia University\nPrincess Sumaya University for Technology\nQueen Noor Civil Aviation Technical College\nWorld Islamic Sciences and Education University\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nAmman is twinned with:\n\nGallery\nSee also\nEarly Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East\nRabbath Ammon\nPhiladelphia\nDowntown Amman\nAmman Citadel\nSeil Amman\nList of tallest buildings in Amman\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nAmman Digital Community Facebook page\nGreater Amman Municipality Facebook page\nAmman public transportation map\nPhotos of Amman from the American Center of Research",
          "summary": "Amman is the capital and the largest city of Jordan, and the country's economic, political, and cultural center. With a population of five million as of 2024, Amman is Jordan's primate city and is the largest city in the Levant region, the fifth-largest city in the Arab world, and the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East.\nAmman is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman dates to the 8th millennium BC in 'Ain Ghazal, home to the world's oldest statues of the human form. During the Iron Age, the city was known as Rabat Aman, the capital of the Ammonite Kingdom. In the 3rd century BC, the city was renamed Philadelphia and became one of the ten Greco-Roman cities of the Decapolis. Later, in the 7th century AD, the Rashidun Caliphate renamed the city Amman. Throughout most of the Islamic era, the city alternated between periods of devastation and periods of relative prosperity. Amman was largely abandoned during the Ottoman period from the 15th century until 1878, when it was resettled by Circassians. The city grew after it was connected to the Hejaz Railway in 1904, leading to the formation of its first municipal council in 1909.\nAmman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan's capital in 1921, receiving migrations from different Jordanian and Levantine cities, and later several successive waves of refugees: Palestinians in 1948 and 1967; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003; and Syrians since 2011. It was initially built on seven hills, but now spans over 19 hills combining 22 areas, which are administered by the Greater Amman Municipality. Areas of Amman have gained their names from either the hills (jabal) or the valleys (wadi) they occupy, such as Jabal al-Luweibdeh and Wadi Abdoun. East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities, while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city.\nApproximately one million visitors arrived in Amman in 2018, which made it the 89th most-visited city in the world and the 12th most-visited Arab city. Amman has a relatively fast growing economy and it is ranked as a Beta− global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Moreover, it was named one of the Middle East and North Africa's best cities according to economic, labor, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. The city is among the most popular locations in the Arab world for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices, alongside Doha and only behind Dubai. Amman has a bus network, including a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system that serves the city and connects it to neighboring Zarqa.",

          "content": "عَمَّان هي عاصمه المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه ومركز محافظه العاصمه. تُعد اكبر مدن المملكه وواحده من اكبر المدن العربيه بالنسبه لعدد السكان، اذ بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2023 حوالي 4.8 مليون نسمه، مما يجعلها ايضًا واحده من اسرع المدن نموًا بالسكان بالعالم. تقع المدينه في وسط المملكه على دائره عرض 31 شمالاً وخط طول 35 شرقًا في منطقه تكثر فيها الجبال، فنشات في الوديان بين الجبال اولاً فضاقت على سكانها، فارتقوا سفوحها واستمروا في الاتساع عبر قممها حتى انتشرت المدينه باطرافها فوق 20 جبلا.\nتُعتبر عمّان المركز التجاري والاداري للاردن وقلبه الاقتصادي والتعليمي، حيث اصبحت عمّان نقطه استقطاب للكثير من الجاليات العربيه لموقعها المتميز ولعمارتها المعاصره، كما تستقطب عمّان الكثير من السياح سنويًا من اوروبا الغربيه وامريكا الشماليه واليابان واستراليا ومن الدول العربيه المجاوره والقريبه، وكثيرًا من عائلات دول الخليج العربي تحديدًا، اذ تكثر بها المعالم السياحيه عمومًا والعلاجيه الطبيه خصوصاً. كان من نتيجه وقوع عمّان في مثل هذا الموقع الاستراتيجي في بلاد الشام والشرق الاوسط، ان اصبح موقعها يتحكم بالاقتصاد الوطني ويُحرّك 90% من الاستثمار على المستوى الوطني.\nيرجع تاريخ مدينه عمّان الى الالف السابع قبل الميلاد، وبهذا تُعتبر من ضمن اقدم مدن العالم الماهوله بالسكان الى يومنا هذا. وعمّان مدينه قديمه اقيمت على انقاض مدينه عرفت باسم «ربّه عمّون» ثم «فيلادلفيا» ثم «عمّان» اشتقاقاً من «ربه عمّون»، واتخذها العمّونيون عاصمه لهم. وقد اُنشئت المدينه على تلال سبعه، وكانت مركزًا للمنطقه على ما يبدو في ذلك الوقت، وهي احدى عواصم بلاد الشام الاربع، وهي ايضًا احدى المدن الشاميه القديمه التي اصبحت عاصمهً لاماره شرق الاردن ومن ثم المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه بعد استقلالها في العام 1946 عن بريطانيا.\nيسكن عمّان الحديثه مجموعه متنوعه من السكان من اصول مختلفه اتوا من مختلف المناطق، منهم من اتى من مدن اردنيه قريبه، ومنهم من اتى من فلسطين، ومنهم من القوقاز وسوريا والعراق.\nشهدت امانه عمان الكبرى مؤخرًا تطورًا كبيرًا، حيث توسعت عمان بشكل لم تشهده المدينه من قبل. ونالت خطه مدينه عمّان الشموليه جوائز عالميه منها جائزه القياده العالميه في تخطيط المدن وجائزه المدينه عن قاره اسيا لعام 2007. يبلغ عدد المناطق الاداريه في امانه عمان 22 منطقه مُوزعه جغرافيا تحوي كل منطقه طاقمًا متكاملا من الموظفين، اما من الناحيه الاداريه فهناك مجلس امانه عمان الكبرى الذي يضم 68 عضوا برئاسه امين العاصمه، والمجلس مقسم بدوره الى 14 لجنه مختلفه.\nيُشار بالذكر الى انه تم اعتماد يوم 2 اذار/ مارس من كل عام يومًا لمدينه عمّان بعد اقرار مجلس الوزراء الاردني قرارًا بذلك في بدايه عام 2021، وذلك في اطار الاحتفاء بمرور 100 عام على تاسيس الدوله الاردنيّه.\n\nالتسميه والتاريخ\nالعصور القديمه\nيعود تاريخ عمّان الى اكثر من 7000 سنه قبل الميلاد. وقد مرّت عليها حضارات عديده دلّت عليها الاثار المنتشره في ارجاء المدينه. وخلال هذه الفتره الطويله، شهدت المدينه الكثير من الحضارات، كان اهمها العمونيون. يُعد المدرج الروماني احد اكبر الاثار المتبقيه في المدينه. كما يدل جبل القلعه باثاره المختلفه يدل على الحضارات العمونيه والاغريقيه والرومانيه والبيزنطيه والامويه، بالاضافه الى رجم الملفوف الواقع في جبل عمان والمطل على وادي صقره وهو ما تبقى من حضارات فتره ما قبل التاريخ لعبّاد الطبيعه وعناصرها كالشمس والقمر والنجوم.\n\nيعود اول تواجد بشري في مدينه عمّان في اثار عين غزال شرق العاصمه الى 9 الاف عام من الان. لقد كشفت التنقيبات على ان هذه المنطقه هي من اغنى مواقع العصر الحجري الحديث ما قبل الفخاري، كما ان القريه قد سُكنت دون انقطاع. كانت عين غزال مستوطنه زراعيه ورعويه بُنيت من الحجاره غير المشذبه، وكانت المباني مستطيله الشكل وبجدران مستقيمه، وقد رُصفت الارضيات ثم قصرت بالجبس المدكوك حد اللمعان، وبعد ذلك تم طلائه باللون الاحمر. ان اهم ما يميز موقع عين غزال التماثيل البشريه المُكتشفه، والتي تم العثور عليها في المنطقه الوسطى للموقع على مجموعتين من التماثيل البشريه، والتي تُعد من التماثيل النادره في العالم.\nلقد قدم الى عمّان الحيثيون والهكسوس، ثم قبائل العماليق الاقدمين، تلتهم قبائل بني عمون، او العمونيين، الذين اعطوا المدينه اسمهم فاطلقوا عليها في البدايه اسم ربه عمّون، والربه تعني العاصمه او دار الملك ثم سقطت مع مرور الزمن كلمه ربه وبقيت عمون حتى اطلق عليها الامويون اسم عمّان. اتخذه العمونيون جبل القلعه مقرًا لحكمهم في المدينه، وهو مشرف على وسط عمّان حاليًا.\nقام الاشورويون بالتمدد غربًا نحو منطقه العمونيين، حيث لم يستطيعوا الوقوف بوجههم في بدايه الامر، وانضم العمونييون الى حلف ارامي لمقاومه النفوذ الاشوري في بدايه القرن التاسع قبل الميلاد، ولكن الاشوريين استطاعوا احتلال مملكه العمونيين، وقرر الملك الاشوري سنحاريب منح عمون الاستقلال الذاتي. كان للسيطره الاشوريه اثر في استتباب الامن، مما مكّن العمونييون من السيطره على جزء ٍ كبيرٍ من طرق القوافل التجاريه. قاوم العمونيون البابليين - الذين استمروا في هجومهم على الاجزاء الجنوبيه من الامبراطوريه الاشوريّه، ما اثّر سلبيًا على الوضع الاقتصادي. وفي عهد الملك نبوخذ نصر، استطاع البابليّون السيطره عليها.\n\nورث البابليون املاك الاشوريين في اسيا في عام 612 ق. م. وقد قام ملك مصر بغزو بلاد الشام في عام 590 ق. م، وهي فلسطين وشرقي الاردن. ثم قام نبوخذ نصر ملك البابليين انذاك في عام 586 ق. م بسبي اهالي القدس واعاد البلاد الى سلطانه.\nفي عام 539 ق.م استطاع قورش الفارسي القضاء على الامبراطوريه البابليه واقامه الامبراطوريه الفارسيه، ثم استولى الفرس على فلسطين والاردن، ودخلوا عمّان، واصبحت في تلك الفتره تحت حكم الامبراطوريه الفارسيه. ولقد منح الفرس عمّان حكمًا ذاتيًا في الفتره ما بين 540 ـ 332 ق. م، الا ان الاغريق قَضوا على دوله الفرس عام 332 ق.م، وبدات فتره الامبراطوريه اليونانيه.\nسيطر الاغريق البطالسه على المنطقه بما فيها ربه عمون، التي ابدل اسمها بطليموس الثاني عام 285 ق.م الى اسم «فيلادلفيا»- ويعني مدينه الحب الاخوي؛\nنسبه للقائد «فيلادلفيوس» وجعل من جبل القلعه موقعا للمعابد كجبل الاكروبولس في اثينا. انتعشت في هذا العهد منطقه عراق الامير، نسبه لقصر الملك طوبيا المعروف بعراق الامير، او قصر العبد.\nانقسمت عمان لتصبح جزءاً من الدولتين النبطيه والسلوقيه الى ان استولى عليها الملك الروماني «هيرودس» في العام 30 ق.م. وبهذا تدخل المدينه العهد الروماني ومن ثم البيزنطي حتى منصف القرن السابع.\nالعصر الروماني والبيزنطي\n\nامتد العهد الروماني ثم البيزنطي من 63 - 636. واصبحت المدينه جزءًا من حلف الديكابولس، وهو تحالف كان يضم عشره مدن تقع اليوم في الاردن وسوريا وفلسطين. لقد اُعيد بناء فيلادلفيا ايام الحكم الروماني لتشمل مدرج وشوارع مرصوفه واعمده على الطراز الروماني. ايام الحكم البيزنطي كانت مقر الكرسي المسيحي وبُنيَت الكثير من الكنائس ولكن المدينه لم تعد مزدهره كما كانت. وقد وصلها الفرس في عام 614م واعادوا احتلالها، لكن حكمهم كان قصيرا وانتهى قبيل وصول جيوش المسلمين اليها بعد عده سنوات.\nيوجد في المدينه اثار رومانيه ما زالت قائمه ليومنا هذا، اهمها ساحه الفورم والمدرج الروماني. يقع الفورم بين جبل القلعه وجبل الجوفه امام المدرج الروماني بوسط عمان. تبلغ مساحه الفورم والمسرح ما مجموعه 7600 متر مربع ويعود تاريخ بنائهما على الارجح الى القرن الثاني الميلادي وتحديدًا بين عامي 138م و 161م ابان عهد القيصر انطونيوس بيوس. اليوم بني الى جانب الفورم حديقه ذات نوافير عده، تستعمل كماوى للهروب من ازمه المرور وزحمه التسوق في وسط مدينه عمان. كانت الساحه محاطه من ثلاث جهات بشوراع اعمده، التي يشاهد المرء منها اليوم فقط الاعمده الواقعه في الجزء الجنوبي من الساحه، المتاخمه للمدرج. بنى الرومان، نظام تصريف للمياه تحت الساحه.\nاما البيزنطيون فيتركون كنائس عده، حيث كشفت حفريات دائره الاثار العامه في عمّان، عن كنائس تعود الى فتره القرن الرابع الميلادي وحتى الثامن، اثناء حكم البيزنطيين للمنطقه في ضواحي المدينه في كل من: الصويفيه، خلدا، الرابيه، الجبيهه، ياجوز، البصه، القويسمه، رجم الكرسي، اللويبده في داره الفنون، حسبان التي تبعد عن عمان 20 كيلو مترا، والجبل الاخضر.\n\nالعصر الاسلامي\nبدا هذا العصر بعد الفتح الاسلامي للشام في 635، واستطاع جيش يزيد بن ابي سفيان ان يفتح عمّان، وتنتهي بذلك دوله الغساسنه التابعه للبيزنطيين، والمتحكمه بمنطقه البلقاء التي كانت عمان جزءا منها، وعادت المدينه لتُعرف باسمها السامي القديم ثانيه: عمّان او عمّون.\n\nفي العصر الاموي، بنى الامويون قصرًا كبيرًا على جبل القلعه، وغدت عمّان مركزًا اداريًا، يقيم فيها الامير، وتضرب فيها النقود، وتقوم حاميتها بمراقبه طريق القوافل التجاريه، وحراسه طريق الحج، وبرك الماء كبركه زيزاء والقسطل. وعندما الت الامور الى الدوله العباسيه، جرت على ارض كوره عمان (مركز اداري) معارك دُمّرت فيها الاسوار والحصون في مواجهه عسكريه داخليه. ويشير المؤرخون الى ان العباسيين تحصنوا في عمّان عندما ثار بعض الامويين مطالبين بالخلافه في عهد الخليفه المامون بن الرشيد.\n\nكانت عمّان في عهد الفاطميين مركزًا لتجميع القوات، ولكن في اواخر حكمهم في القرن الحادي عشر الميلادي بدات الضغوط الخارجيه بقدوم الصليبيين. وفي سنه 1184 مر صلاح الدين الايوبي بعمّان في طريقه الى الكرك، واصبحت في تلك الفتره جزءًا من دوله الايوبيين. امّا في عهد المماليك، فقد شهدت عمان استقرارًا، وازدهرت اسواقها في مواسم الحج. لقد حظيت عمّان باهتمام الظاهر بيبرس ورعايته عندما اعتلى عرش دوله المماليك في مصر والشام. وفي عهد السلطان قلاوون عام 1279، انتقلت الولايه من السلط الى عمّان، وفي عام 1355 بنى المماليك مدرسه في عمان لتدريس المذهب الحنفي.\nفي عام 1516 توالى على حكم الامبراطوريه العثمانيه عدد من السلاطين، واستطاع الاتراك العثمانيون دخول عمّان، الا انها بعد ذلك دخلت دفتر النسيان والاهمال حتى نهايه القرن التاسع عشر، نتيجه لعده زلازل ضربتها وانتشار الاوبئه مثل الطاعون، حيث بدات منذ 1878، تشهد تزايدًا في اعداد السكان، اذ قامت السلطات العثمانيه بالسماح لعدد من العائلات الشركسيه (المهاجره من اضطهاد القيصر الروسي) بالسكن في عمّان. وتجدر الاشاره الى ان متحف الاثار الاردني به نماذج من اثار هذه الحضارات كلها عبر عصورها المتتاليه.\nقال عنها المقدسي في كتابه: «احسن التقاسيم في معرفه الاقاليم»، ان مدينه عمّان هي واحده من ضمن ثلاث مدن تشبه مكه، حيث يقول: «رايت لها ثلاث نظائر: عمّان بالشام، واصطخر بفارس، وقريه الحمراء بخراسان». وقد جاء ذكر عمّان في كتب ادب الرحلات العربيه، فقد اورد عنها في كتاب معجم البلدان لياقوت الحموي ثلاث ابيات شعر قال فيها الاحوص بن محمد الانصاري:\n\nعمّان الحديثه\nتاسست عمّان الحديثه في نهايه القرن التاسع عشر مع وصول طلائع المهاجرين الشركس من قبائل الشابسوغ ليستقروا قرب سيل عمان والمدرج الروماني عام 1878، نتيجه تهجيرهم القسري بالقوه المسلحه من قبل القوات الروسيه القيصريه التي استطاعت اكمال احتلال وطنهم الام شمال القوقاز عام 1864 بعد قتال شركسي ضد هذه القوات التي كانت تعتبر من اقوى الجيوش الاوروبيه طيله ما يزيد عن مئه عام. ثم عملت على تفريغ وطنهم القومي التاريخي بتهجيرهم الى الدوله العثمانيه المجاوره، لاحلال مستوطنين من الشعوب المواليه للروس كالقوزاق والجورجيين والاوكرانيين الروس انفسهم. كانت شرق الاردن احدى المناطق العثمانيه في ذلك الوقت والتي انزلت فيها الدوله العثمانيه الشراكسه المهجّرين، وكانت عمّان المدينه الاثريه اولى مناطق الاردن التي نزل فيها الشراكسه منذ عام 1878. كان هؤلاء المهاجرون الشراكسه من الفلاحين الذين عملوا على زراعه الارض وتربيه الماشيه وبناء بيوتهم ومساجدهم، حيث وزعت عليهم السلطات العثمانيه الاراضي الصالحه للزراعه، مما انعش القريه واعاد اليها الحياه. بعد ذلك اصبحت عمان عامل جذب لقدوم المزيد من السكان اليها من مختلف الجهات. وكانت عمّان ضمن المناطق التي سُكنت لوجود المياه فيها بوفره، وفي عام 1933، بلغ عدد الشركس فيها 1,700 نسمه.\nلقد توالت على عمان مجموعات اخرى من المهاجرين الشراكسه القادمين من شمال القوقاز بعد احتلال بلادهم من قبل الجيوش الروسيه القيصريه عام 1864، فسكنوا في احياء ما زالت تحمل اسماءها حتى اليوم مثل حي المهاجرين وحي الشابسوغ وحي القبرطاي ومحلّه الابزاخ. تتابع قدوم الناس الى عمّان والاستقرار فيها عبر السنين التاليه، فقدمت جماعات من الارمن والاكراد والشيشان والشوام والمقدسيين والحجازيين وغيرهم مما اضفى على المجتمع الاردني تنوعا عرقياً شكل جزءا هاما من نسيجه.\nلقد عزمت الدوله العثمانيه في نهايه القرن التاسع على انشاء ولايه في المنطقه يكون مركزها عمان. وقد جاء في مشروع الولايه المقترح: «فالبلد السوري، يتكون حالياً من ولايه دمشق، وولايه بيروت، ومتصرفيه القدس الشريف. غير ان هذه المنطقه شاسعه، تكاد تبلغ مساحتها نصف مساحه الاناضول. وهي مناطق عامره، فيمكن تشكيل ولايه فيها، على ان تكون عاصمتها عمان، وان يطلق على الولايه اسم ولايه عمّان او معموره الحميديه، ويُتخذ في معان والشوبك وحسبان والسلط وعين الزرقاء وباقي الاماكن قائم مقاميات». وكان السبب في اقتراح فكره الولايه الحميديه ان تشكيل ولايه عمّان سيعمل على ضمان الامن على الطريق التي تخترقها ابتداء من دمشق حتى المدينه المنوره. اذ ترافق ذلك مع تفكير الدوله العثمانيه بانشاء سكه حديد، تبدا من دمشق وتصل الى اليمن، على طول الساحل الشرقي للبحر الاحمر. غير ان كمال باشا، صاحب فكره المشروع المقترح، ابدى تخوفه من ان تتعرض هذه الطريق لهجوم قوى اجنبيه، كالانجليز، الذين يحاولون احتلال مصر، مما يعرقل حركه القوات العثمانيه الذاهبه الى الحجاز واليمن.\nعلى الرغم من ان مشروع الولايه الجديده ظل فكره، ولم يُطبّق، الا انه بقي حاضرًا في اذهان السياسيين والعسكريين العثمانيين اثناء ادارتهم لهواجس ومخاطر الامن الداخلي والخارجي. فقاموا بدءًا من العام 1878، بتشجيع استقرار الشركس والشيشان، على طول خط استراتيجي، يمتد من منبج وحمص والجولان فعمّان، حيث كانت الاضطرابات والعصيان على الدوله امرًا مالوفًا. ولم يدرك الشركس ابعاد هذا الدور، ووجدوا انفسهم حين وصلوا الى البلقاء في العراء. وواجهوا المصاعب بالصبر والجهد والتحدي، معتمدين على انفسهم. وقد بدؤوا باستصلاح الاراضي وزارعتها، وشرعوا ببناء قرى جديده هنا وهناك، فكانت عمّان وناعور ووادي السير وصويلح وغيرها. جاء الشركس في بدايه وصولهم الى عمّان، قادمين من نابلس ومنطقه خربه الشركس التابعه للواء عكا. وكان اغلب الفوج الاول من المهاجرين الشركس، في العام 1878، يتكون من قبيله الشابسوغ، حيث سكنوا بين الابنيه الاثريه للمدينه، وفي دهاليز المدرج الروماني والكهوف المحيطه به.\nاسهم الخط الحديدي الحجازي في زياده ملحوظه بعدد سكان المدينه، لا سيما عندما رُبطت به المدينه عبر محطه عمان التي تبعد عن مركز المدينه خمسه كيلومترات، وذلك عام 1903. لذلك اخذت اوضاع عمّان السكانيه والاقتصاديه تشهد تطورًا تدريجيًا بطيئًا، فاُنشئ اول مجلس بلدي في المدينه عام 1909، وغدت مركزاً لمديريه الناحيه عام 1914، وقد كانت عمان قبل تاسيس الاردن الحديث سنه 1921، مركزًا مهمًا رغم قله عدد سكانها مقارنه ببعض المدن المجاوره كالسلط ونابلس والقدس، حيث كانت اشبه بقريه كبيره طيله تلك الفتره. وقُدّر عدد سكانها بعد انتهاء الحرب العالميه الاولى بما بين 1500 و 2000 نسمه او اكثر بقليل، معظمهم من الشراكسه المهاجرين، الذين تمركزوا في وسط البلد في احياء المهاجرين والشابسوغ والقبرطاي ومحله الابزاخ والاشرفيه وجبل التاج واجزاء من جبل عمان.\nمئويه امانه عمّان الكبرى\n\nاحتفلت امانه عمان الكبرى عام 2009 بالذكرى المئويه لتاسيسها، اذ تاسس اول مجلس بلدي عام 1909 كون مسيره المائه عام الماضيه من عمر عمّان شهدت تطورًا كبيرًا في شتى الميادين، وتدرجت من قريه صغيره الى عاصمه حديثه ومن مجلس بلدي الى امانه عمان الكبرى، وتخطت العديد من الصعاب والتحديات، فضلا عن تطور مفهوم ومستوى ونوعيه الخدمات التي تقدم للعمانيين.\nلقد تعاقب على رئاسه المدينه، خلال مئه عام، منذ تاسيس مجلسها البلدي الاول عام 1909 وحتى العام 2009، ثمانيه عشر رئيسا للبلديه (1909-1950)، واربعه عشر امينًا للعاصمه (1950-1987)، وتسعه امناء لعمّان الكبرى (1987-2015).\n\nجغرافيا\nتقع عمّان على عده جبال، وترتفع عن سطح البحر قرابه 750 مترًا، ومتوسط ارتفاع جبالها السبع الاولى التي اُنشئت عليها 918 متر. تقع مدينه العقبه على بعد 360 كيلومترًا جنوبها، ومدينه اربد على مسافه تقارب من 80 كيلومترًا شمالها. بينما يقع نهر الاردن على مسافه 45 كيلومترًا الى الغرب منها. اما عن مدن الجوار فتبعد القدس عنها بمسافه 80 كيلومترًا الى الغرب، ودمشق مسافه 180 كيلومترًا الى الشمال، وبغداد مسافه 800 كيلومترًا الى الشرق، اما مكه المكرمه فتقع على مسافه 1225 كيلومترًا الى الجنوب.\n\nالتضاريس\nتمتد عمّان بشكل رئيسي فوق عشرين جبلاً تقريبًا على طول المدينه وعرضها ومن اهم جبالها السبعه الاوائل وهي جبل القصور، جبل الجوفه، جبل التاج، جبل النزهه، جبل النصر، جبل الاشرفيه، جبل النظيف، والجبل الاخضر. بالاضافه الى جبل عمان وجبل اللويبده وجبل الحسين وجبل القلعه. معظمها موجود الان ضمن عمان الشرقيه، وتتنوع في المدينه التضاريس كالتالي:\n\nالمنطقه الشماليه، وتتكون من عده جبال متموّجه نوعًا ما، كما في الجبيهه وشفا بدران وابو نصير.\nالمنطقه الوسطى، تتميز بانها ملتقى الاوديه مع سيل عمان، وهي اوديه شديده الانحدار تتخللها النتوءات الصخريه البارزه وطبقات صخريه متموّجه على سفوح الجبال التي تمر من خلالها، مثل وادي عبدون ووادي صقره ووادي الحداده.\nالمنطقه الغربيه، تمتد على جانب غور الاردن، ويتجاوز ارتفاعها 1000 متر كما في تلاع العلي والشميساني وصويلح.\nالمنطقه الشرقيه والجنوبيه الشرقيه، وتتميز بسطحها المتموج، وتعد من الاراضي الصحراويه القاحله الممتده الى الصحراء الاردنيه، كما في ماركا الجنوبيه والقويسمه.\n\nتنظيم المدينه\nتنقسم عمان الى جزئين رئيسيين وهما:\n\nعمان الشرقيه وهي الجزء الاقدم من المدينه.\nعمان الغربيه وهي الجزء الاحدث من المدينه.\nكانت عمان مقتصره على الشركس في نهايات القرن التاسع عشر وحتى بدايه القرن العشرين، ولكن بعد اعلانها عاصمه لاماره شرق الاردن ومن بعدها المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه ازداد التوسع العمراني ووفِدَ اليها الناس من مختلف المناطق، وبدات مدينه عمان الحديثه بالتوسع في عقد الخمسينات والستينات من القرن الماضي حيث اخذت احياء جديده في الظهور في عمان الغربيه.\nفي بدايه عام 2007 قررت امانه عمان الكبرى، ضم اراض قريبه من مطار الملكه علياء الدولي جنوب العاصمه، لتصبح جزءا من مناطق المدينه، مثل الجيزه ومرج الحمام وسحاب، مما ضاعف مساحه عمان لتصبح 1,680 كم². وضمن الخطه للسنوات المقبله، تتجه الامانه الى التوسع العمراني نحو المناطق الشرقيه والجنوبيه حيث سهوله استغلال الاراضي المنبسطه. وضمن المخططات لتوفير الخدمات لهذه المناطق الجديده تستعد الامانه لاقامه مشروع خط قطارات خفيفه بين المناطق الجنوبيه لعمّان وصولا الى الزرقاء شرقا على امتداد 26 كيلومتر.\nكما شهدت عمّان الغربيه نموا سريعا في العقدين الاخيرين حيث ظهرت احياء باكملها. وتحاول امانه عمّان اقامه مشاريع تنمويه طموحه في شرق عمّان خلال الفتره الحاليه.\n مناطق عمان\nالقائمه التاليه باسماء مناطق عمان الكبرى الاثنان والعشرين والتي تقع ضمن عمان الغربيه وعمان الشرقيه:\n\nالغطاء الاخضر\n\nتتنوع التضاريس في مناطق عمّان الريفيه بين السهول والجبال العاليه والوديان، وتحيط الاماكن السياحيه بجميع انحاء العاصمه حيث منتزه عمّان القومي وحدائق البحرين والمدينه المائيه جنوبا، مرورا بالطبيعه الجميله في وادي السير وام الاسود والحمر وماحص غربا، وانتهاء بقرى زي ودبين شمالا.\nيكاد يخلو وسط مدينه عمّان من الغابات فيما عدا بعض الاماكن مثل المدينه الرياضيه والجامعه الاردنيه وحدائق الحسين، وحدائق الملك عبد الله بالمقابلين، وغابات اخرى على طريق المطار.\nيُشار الى ان زراعه الغابات قد بدات في الاردن منذ اكثر من 60 عاماً مضت. وتجري معظم انشطه التشجير حول العاصمه والمدن السكنيه بالاضافه الى زراعات جوانب الطرق، ومصدّات الرياح والزراعات في مجاري الوديان. تُزرع الاشجار ايضاً كجزء متكامل من نظم مندمجات الزراعه والغابات.\nفي عام 1995 تضمنت الزراعات حوالي 1000 كيلومتر من الاشجار على طول الطرق، 7000 كيلومتر من مصدات الرياح واحزمه الوقايه و 500 كيلومتر من الاشجار على طول جوانب المجاري المائيه.\n\nالمناخ\nالطقس في عمّان معتدل بشكل عام، اذ يسود مناخ متوسطي معظم مناطق العاصمه، خصوصًا في المرتفعات. بينما يسود بعض مناطقها المناخ شبه الصحراوي وخاصه في المناطق الشرقيه منها. ترتفع درجات الحراره صيفًا، وتصل اعلى مستوياتها في منتصف اب/ اغسطس، حيث تصل في بعض الاحيان الى منتصف الثلاثينات مئويه. وتنخفض الحراره شتاء لتصل في كانون الثاني/ يناير احيانًا الى الصفر او ما دونه، حيث يتسبب ذلك بتساقط الثلوج على المرتفعات. ويعتدل المناخ في فصلي الربيع والخريف.\nاما بالنسبه لمعدلات الامطار فتكون معدومه في بعض الاشهر مثل حزيران وتموز واب. بينما تكون في اعلى معدلاتها في شهري كانون الثاني وشباط، حيث يمكن ان يصل مستواها الى اكثر من 170 ميليمترًا.\n\nالسكان\nيعود اول تواجد بشري في مدينه عمّان الى 9 الاف عام، حيث تشير اثار عين غزال شرق العاصمه الى هذا. وخلال هذه الفتره الطويله، شهدت المدينه الكثير من الحضارات كان اهمها العمونيون، وبعد ذلك احتل المدينه كل من اليونان والفرس والرومان والبيزنطيون. وبعد الفتح الاسلامي لبلاد الشام استمر التواجد البشري فيها حتى دخلت دفتر النسيان في نهايه العصر المملوكي اي في القرن السادس عشر، الى ان تم اعاده اكتشافها في نهايه القرن التاسع عشر، وهجره شعوب مختلفه من القوقاز، الذين تعرض كل منهم لاضطهاد في بلاده، فقامت الدوله العثمانيه بتوزيعهم على اراضيها، وكانت عمان من هذه الاراضي. وبهذا، يبدا تاريخ التواجد البشري في عمان الحديثه، حيث بدات الحياه تدب في عمّان المعاصره شيئا فشيئا بعد هجره الشركس في بادئ الامر من القوقاز عام 1880 او قبله بقليل، وخاصه الى محلتي الشابسوغ والمهاجرين، ومن ثم هجره كل من الارمن والشيشان. ثم مالبثت ان استقبلت المدينه الكثير من العرب من مختلف المناطق، وبالاخص ذوي الاصول الاردنيه (الذين سكن بعضهم تجمعات محدده، مثل حي الطفايله الذي يعد اكبر تجمعي لابناء المحافظات في العاصمه ويقع في جبل الجوفه)، مع المواطنين ذوي الاصول الفلسطينيه الذين هاجروا من مختلف مناطق فلسطين، والذين تزايدوا بشكل كبير، حتى اصبح العرب هم الغالبيه المطلقه.\n\nالتركيبه السكانيه\nتعتبر عمّان من اكثر المدن تسارعا بالنمو في منطقه الشرق الاوسط، ويقطنها مايزيد عن ثلث سكان المملكه. ويبلغ عدد سكان عمّان الكبرى بضواحيها اليوم حوالي 4 ملايين نسمه، يدين الغالبيه الساحقه منهم بالاسلام. كما يُعتبر المسيحيون من العرب والارمن وغيرهم، المكون الديني الثاني بعد المسلمين، ويشكلون ما نسبته 6% من السكان من مختلف الطوائف. كما يكفل الدستور الاردني للجميع حريه ممارسه الاديان. يُشار الى ان عدد سكان المدينه قد ازداد بشكل ملحوظ بعد عده منعطفات مهمه شهدتها المنطقه كان اولها حرب 1948 وحرب 1967، حيث لجا ونزح مئات الالاف من فلسطين. كما كان لاحداث حرب الخليج الثانيه دور كبير بازدياد العدد، حيث عاد مئات الالاف من الاردنيين من الكويت وباقي دول الخليج بين عاميّ 1991 و 1992. هذا بالاضافه الى تضاعف مساحه المدينه بعد ضم ضواحي كبيره اليها في عام 2007 (شكلت عمّان الكبرى). كما يشكل اليوم المقيمون العرب من الدول المجاوره، وخاصه من سوريا والعراق، جزءًا لا باس به من سكان المدينه، والذين ازدادت اعدادهم بشكل كبير بعد كل من الغزو الامريكي للعراق والازمه السوريه. بالاضافه الى وجود مئات الالاف من العمّال والعاملات المقيمين من الدول الاسيويه ومصر. كما تتواجد جاليات غربيه عديده، يوجد لمعظمها معاهد ثقافيه ومدارس اكاديميه. قدّرت امانه عمان الكبرى ان عدد سكان المدينه، دون القرى التابعه لها، سيصل سنه 2025 الى حوالي 6.4 مليون نسمه، اي ثلاثه اضعاف الرقم لعام 2007.\nان المجتمع العمّاني حاليًا هو خليط من عائلات ذات اصول مختلفه؛ شرق اردنيه، وفلسطينيه، وحجازيه، وسوريه، واقليه من الشركس والشيشان والارمن والتركمان والاكراد. ولقد ظهر من هذا المكون الكثير من المشاهير الذين ساهموا بنهضه المدينه والبلد بشكل عام على جميع الاصعده والمجالات، كالادب والفنون والهندسه والطب والرياضه والاعلام والاقتصاد والتكنلوجيا والتعليم والسياسه والجيش.\nباستثناء بعض من عشائر البلقاء (كاللوزي وابو قوره والعبد اللات والعدوان)، فلا يوجد فعليا مِن سكّان عمّان مَن هم ذو اصول عمّانيه، ولكن هناك اجيال نشات منذ ما يزيد عن قرن بعد هجره مئات الالاف من هذه المناطق المجاوره، ومن ضمنها المدن الاردنيه القريبه كالسلط واربد والطفيله والكرك ومعان. ياتي هذا بعد خلو المدينه تقريبا من سكانها لعده قرون - منذ القرن السادس عشر، نتيجه للزلازل وانتشار الاوبئه كالطاعون، بالاضافه الى اهمال العثمانيين لها في معظم فتره حكمهم لـبلاد الشام.\n\nاللاجئون\nكانت عمّان تستقبل المزيد من السكان عبر العقود السته الماضيه من دول ابتلي اهلها بالحروب والثورات. وقد استقبلت المدينه كغيرها من مدن الاردن العديد من اللاجئين من دول الجوار خلال ازمات القرن الماضي وبالاخص من فلسطين ولبنان والعراق وسوريا. يطيب للبعض البقاء والاستقرار في عمّان ويختار البعض الاخر العوده الى بلاده عند استقرار الامور فيها او متابعه الهجره الى دول اخرى. ينصهر الكثيرون في المجتمع العمّاني ولكن تبقى فئه في تجمعات سكانيه تحمل هويتهم الاصليه كمخيمات اللاجئين الفلسطينيين. فبالرغم من الانصهار الكبير الذي حدث ببينهم وبين معظم فئات المجتمع الا انه لا زال عدد منهم يعيش في المخيمات. وبحسب احصاءات وكاله الغوث التابعه للامم المتحده، يقطن هذه المخيمات قرابه 20% من فلسطينيي الاردن. تقوم وكاله الغوث، او الاونروا، بالاشراف على جميع المخيمات العشره في المملكه والتي تشمل مخيمات عمان الاربعه منذ النكبه، وهي مخيم البقعه ومخيم الوحدات ومخيم ماركا (شنلر) ومخيم الحسين.\nيُشار بالذكر الى ان المدينه تستضيف مئات اللاجئين من دول بعيده نسبيًا، كالصومال والسودان وجنوب السودان، حيث يتواجد على ارض الاردن بشكل عام 44 جنسيه لاجئه حسب تقرير نشرته المفوضيه الساميه للامم المتحده لشؤون اللاجئين عام 2014.\n\nالمواصلات والاتصالات\nالنقل والطرق\nشكّل التخطيط المدني القديم لعمّان تحديا لمواكبه تطورات العصر واحتياجات المدينه، وعمّان ليست بالمدينه الثريه، ولكنها تمكنت من تخطي الصعاب وما زالت تُنشئ طرقا جديده تحل ازمات المدينه السابقه. اذ توجد الان في عمّان عده طرق سريعه، تربط اجزاء المدينه بعضها ببعض كما تربطها بمدن المملكه الاخرى، فهناك شارع الاردن وشارع الاستقلال وشارع الشهيد والحزام الدائري وطريق ياجوز وشارع المدينه الطبيه وشارع الجامعه واوتوستراد الزرقاء وشارع المطار، والطريق الصحراوي. ويعتبر جسر عبدون المعلق ونفق وادي الحداده وطريق عمان التنموي وغيرها من منشات الطرق الجديده من اهم مشاريع امانه عمان الكبرى للتخفيف من وطاه الزحام في الشوارع.\n\nبدات امانه عمّان الكبرى مشروع الباص السريع (BRT) في عام 2010. تعتبر شبكه الحافلات السريعه من اهم مشاريع النقل التي تشهدها عمّان حتى يومنا هذا، اذ يهدف هذا المشروع - والذي انتهى تنفيذ مرحلته الاولى في عام 2012 الا ان حكومه رئيس الوزراء معروف البخيت اوقفت المرحله الثانيه منه لوجود شبهه فساد - الى احداث نقله نوعيّه في واقع الحركه والتنقّل في المدينه – نقله تمهّد الطريق للوصول الى مدينه عصريه مستدامه قابله للحياه. ان فكره خط الباصات السريعه تعتمد على تخصيص مسارب لحركه باصات النقل العام، ويحظر على المركبات الاخرى استخدام هذه المسارب. وبذلك يمكن نقل اعداد كبيره من الناس من خلال هذه المسارب بسرعه وسهوله. ويمكن ان تصل سعه النقل لكل مسرب حوالي 40,000 راكب في الساعه في كل اتجاه، بينما لا تتجاوز سعه النقل في المسارب التقليديه التي تستخدمها السيارات والحافلات والمركبات الاخرى الـ 3,250 راكباً. وبالاضافه الى ذلك، فان تكلفه بناء خطوط الباصات السريعه مقبوله جداً، وقد لا تتجاوز 5% من تكلفه بناء نظام نقل يعتمد على السكك الحديديه مثلاً. كذلك استهلاكها للطاقه وكميه الانبعاثات الكليه الناجمه عن النقل بالباصات اقل من تلك الناتجه عن النقل بالسيارات العاديه. الاّ ان المشروع قد اثار جدلا كبيرا في الفتره الحاليه بعد توقفه، مما سبّب باتهامات شعبيه كثيره للقائمين عليه.\n\nاما خدمات النقل التقليديه في عمان فهي موزعه بين الحافلات والسيارات، وهناك شبكه من السيارات للنقل العام تدعى «سرفيس» اي انها تسير في خطوط محدده ويتشارك الركاب باستخدامها ودفع اجرتها. كما يوجد شبكه من سيارات الاجره التي تلبي الطلبات الخاصه موزعه في جميع انحاء المدينه. ذلك عدا عن السيارات السياحيه التي تُؤجر ليقودها السائح بنفسه. هذا بالاضافه الى خدمه التاكسي المميز، وخدمه النقل باستخدام التطبيقات الذكيه (مثل تطبيقات كريم واوبر). كما ان شبكات الحافلات ضمن خدمات النقل العام تؤدي الغرض نفسه. ويوجد في المدينه مجمعان كبيران للحافلات هي مجمع باصات الشمال، والمجمع الجنوبي.\n\nالاتصالات\nنهجت الاردن في مجال الاتصالات بصوره مقبوله فمن شبكه كادت ان تكون غير مجديه في الثمانينات الى خصخصه الاتصالات، واليوم هناك عده شركات خاصه تقدم خدمه الانترنت وثلاث شركات لتقديم خدمه الهاتف المحمول وشبكه اتصالات ارضيه متميزه ووفره في ارقام الهاتف.\n\nالطيران\nلعمّان مطاران: مطار الملكه علياء الدولي الذي اُنجز عام 1983 ومطار عمان المدني الذي يُستخدم للطيران المدني الاقليمي وللطيران العسكري. وهذان المطاران تنطلق منهما عده خطوط طيران، وشركه طيران الملكيه الاردنيه تستخدم مطار الملكه علياء كما تستخدمه جميع شركات الطيران الدولي الاخرى. اما شركه طيران الاردنيه فتستخدم مطار عمان وكذلك شركات الطيران التي تطير ضمن الاقليم فقط. يشار بالذكر الى انه تم رفع القدره الاستيعابيه لمطار الملكه علياء من 3.2 مليون مسافر /السنه الى 9 ملايين عند اكتمال اعمال الانشاءات عام 2012 ليصبح واحدا من اهم الوجهات العالميه في المنطقه.\n\nسكه الحديد\nيمر بالمدينه خط سكه حديد الحجاز حيث توجد محطه عمان على الخط بين بلاد الشام ومكه المكرمه انطلاقاً من دمشق والذي توقف العمل به منذ بدايات القرن العشرين، ويُعتبر المبنى الاثري للمحطه من معالم عمّان التاريخيه. وتقع المحطه في منطقه عمان الشرقيه غرب منطقه ماركا وشرق المدرج الروماني بالقرب من مطار ماركا الدولي. يُستخدم هذا الخط الان لنقل الركاب والبضائع بين عمّان ودمشق فقط. ويعمل الاردن على الاستفاده من بعض املاك هذا الخط في بناء مشروع اخر يعود جزء من ارباحه على الخط الحجازي، حيث سيمتد مشروع خط قطارات خفيفه بين المناطق الجنوبيه لعمّان وصولاً الى الزرقاء شرقاً والذي سيمتد لمسافه 26 كيلومتر.\n\nالعماره والتخطيط الحضري\nالتخطيط العمراني\nاتبعت المدينه في نموها العشوائي في بادئ الامر، نظريه النمو حول نواه واحده، حيث كانت هذه النواه هي المسجد الحسيني والمنطقه التجاريه الممتده من راس العين الى موقع المكتبه الوطنيه (مقر امانه عمّان القديم) وعلى جانبي وادي سيل عمّان. الا ان عمليه النمو لم تكن حلقيه او دائريه حول النواه، بل تميزت باضافه قطاعات متفاوته المساحه في المرحله الواحده ومختلفه في اتجاهات نموها خلال المراحل المختلفه. حيث كان نمو المدينه ياتي على شكل تشنجات مفاجئه نتجت عن عوامل سياسيه مرت بها المنطقه، ادت الى انفجارات سكانيه غير متوقعه. حيث اثرت بدورها على الطابع المعماري للمدينه والذي تكوّن بشكل تراكمي طيله القرن الفائت. ان التوسع الذي شهدته عمّان في هذه المرحله كان باتجاهين: الاول على الطريق الواصل بين وسط البلد ووادي السير، والثانيه بين وسط البلد والسلط عن طريق صويلح، حيث رُبطت هاتان المنطقتان بعمّان. وعلى طول مسار هذين الطريقين انتشرت دواوير عمّان وميادينها، التي هي شاهد على مراحل تطور المدينه.\nفي عام 1956، وُضِّع اول مخطط هيكلي لعمّان بمعناه الصحيح، يحدد شكل المدينه ووظائفها والاستعمالات المختلفه وخطوط النقل والمواصلات وغيرها من الخصائص العامه. وفي عام 1964 باشرت امانه العاصمه بوضع الانظمه التفصيليه التي ساهمت فيما بعد بتطبيق محتويات المخططات التنظيميه التي اشرف على وضعها قسم التخطيط في الامانه بالتعاون مع بعض الخبراء بالامم المتحده.\n\nالا ان الزياده غير المتوقعه في عدد السكان بالمدينه نتيجه الحروب المتلاحقه في المنطقه، ادى الى عدم تبني المخطط الشمولي القديم، وان كان هناك عده محاولات اخرى، الا انها كانت تصطدم ايضا بنفس المشكله. اما مؤخرا، فقد شهدت امانه عمان الكبرى تطورا كبيرا، حيث توسعت عمان بشكل مدروس لم تشهده المدينه من قبل. ونالت خطه مدينه عمان الشموليه جوائز عالميه منها جائزه القياده العالميه في تخطيط المدن وجائزه المدينه عن قاره اسيا لعام 2007.\nان من اهم المشكلات الاجتماعيه الحضريه في عمّان حاليا، هي الطفره الكبيره في النمو السكاني والحضري. ومع زياده عدد السكان، واجهت المدينه عده مشاكل منها: ظهور مناطق عشوائيه، نقص المساكن، عدم كفايه المياه، مشكله المرور داخل المدينه.\n\nتبلغ مساحه الاراضي المبنيه في عمّان 640 كم² بنسبه 38% من اجمالي مساحه مناطق الامانه البالغه 1668 كم²، ووالاراضي غير المبنيه 1027 كم² بنسبه 62%. كما تبين ان مساحات الاراضي التجاريه 20 كم² بنسبه 5%، والاراضي الصناعيه 65 كم² بنسبه 15%، والمرافق العامه (مؤسسات حكوميه، مدارس، الحدائق العامه...) 20 كم² بنسبه 5%، والاراضي الزراعيه 21 كم² بنسبه 5%.\nبالاضافه الى شوارع عمّان التي تشكل مساحتها 191 كم² بنسبه 11% من مساحه مناطق الامانه، تعتبر الادراج من سمات مدينه عمان العريقه، حيث تنتشر على سفوح جبالها لتصل البيوت ببعضها البعض حين تعجز الشوارع عن اداء تلك المهمه، اذ يخيل لزائر عمان انها مدينه تقف على قدميها باستمرار، وقد اتخذت بعض بيوتها مواقع لها، ولم يكن ممكنا وصلها مع باقي اجزاء المدينه الا بواسطه الدرج. وبهذا تعتبر هذه الادراج القديمه بحدّ ذاتها معلما تاريخيا. ومن هذه الادراج: الكلحه، اللويبده، رغدان وبسمان. ولقد تم مؤخرًا تحديد مناطق الابراج باربع مناطق فقط هي: المركز التجاري الجديد لمنطقه العبدلي، مركز تقاطعات الطرق الرئيسه (على امتداد ممر وادي عبدون)، بوابه عمان الشماليه (وتقع في الجبيهه بمحاذاه شارع الاردن)، بوابه عمان الجنوبيه (هي المنطقه المتاخمه من الناحيه الشرقيه لطريق المطار ومحاط بالطريق الدائري لوادي عبدون).\n\nالنسيج الحضري\nتشغل المناطق السكنيه الجانب الاكبر من مساحه عمّان، وتتوزع قطاعات السكن ا، ب، ج على الاحياء الراقيه من العاصمه، وهي الواقعه في الجزء الغربي (عمان الغربيه) كالشميساني والمدينه الرياضيه وجبل عمّان وعبدون ودير غبار، وينتشر قطاعا السكن ج، د في المناطق الشرقيه (عمان الشرقيه) والجنوبيه الغربيه كجبل القصور والهاشمي والقلعه والجوفه وماركا والاشرفيه ونزال. حيث تحدد الامانه القطاع وفقا لعده عوامل عمرانيه وتخطيطيه.\nلقد تم تصنيف عمّان عام 2010، ضمن 14 مدينه عربيه كمدينه عالميه (او Global City)، وفقا لمجموعه دراسات العولمه والمدن العالميه GaWC، التي تتخذ من بريطانيا مقرا لها. حيث ياخذ التصنيف بعين الاعتبار: الخصائص الاقتصاديه (كمؤشرات سوق الاسهم / القيمه السوقيه، توفر الخدمات الماليه، اجمالي الناتج المحلي)، والخصائص السياسيه (كحجم المدينه من حيث عدد السكان او حجم التجمعات الحضريه، معايير جوده المعيشه ومدى تطور المدينه، المشاركه والتاثير في مناسبات دوليه)، والخصائص الثقافيه (كمدى شهره المدينه عالميا، تواجد المؤسسات الثقافيه، المرافق الرياضيه، المؤسسات التعليميه والجامعات، مواقع التراث العالمي، والمزارات الدينيه)، والبنيه التحتيه (كنظام النقل والمطارات، ووجود قاعده اتصالات حديثه مثل الالياف البصريه وخدمات الهاتف المحمول، والخدمات الصحيه كالمستشفيات). ويتم اختيار المدن وفقا لتطبيقها لهذه المعايير، او افتقادها لبعضها. حيث احتلت بموجبه عمّان مركزًا ضمن فئه +Gamma، من بين التصنيفات المتعدده للمدن في العالم.\n\nالهويه المعماريه\nيتميز البناء في عمّان عمومًا باستخدام الحجر كجزء اساسي يدعم واجهات البناء من جهاته الاربعه. وهذا لا ينحصر في جزء مُعيّن بالمدينه، ولكن تتميز عمان الغربيه بجمال العماره وجوده الخدمات وانتشار الفنادق من فئه الخمسه نجوم ومعظم الوزارات المنشاه على اسس ومقاييس متميزه في العماره والبناء. اضفت الحجاره المستخدمه في بناء مدينه عمان فناً تميزت به هذه المدينه واضفت على طابعها المعماري لمسه جماليه دفعت المهندسين الى ممارسه ابداعهم في تنوع كبير من اساليب العماره باستخدام الحجر.\nبحسب مجموعه من المهندسين المعماريين حملوا على انفسهم ان ينتجوا نماذج من فن العماره في عمّان، اكدوا تاثر العماره في الاردن بالموروث الحضاري لمدينه عمّان المعماري الاسلامي والروماني واليوناني. الا ان معظمهم اكد ان الفن الاسلامي هو غايه وامنيه بالنسبه لهم. ويعيب المهندسون على بعض الابنيه والتي يسمونها ابنيه التجميع والتي يحمل التصميم فيها سمات عماره الغرب المتزاوجه مع تصميمات المنطقه بدون الاخذ بعين الاعتبار الطابع المعماري الذي يميّز المنطقه وتاريخها والاعتبارات الثقافيه والحضاريه الاخرى. وبعضهم يصمم مبنى تحمل واجهاته اكثر من ثقافه وتراث اطلق عليه المهندسون «اسلوب الابهار» والخالي من المضمون والموروث والفاشل هندسيا وذكروا عددا من تلك النماذج في اماكن متعدده في عمان. لم ينكر المهندسون الحاجه احيانا الى ادخال بعض المواد العصريه للبناء مثل الزجاج والصفائح المعدنيه ضمن تصميم مدروس يراعي تطوير العماره العربيه مبينين ان هذا التداخل مطلوب ولا غبار عليه.\n\nان اساليب العماره في عمان عديده ولا يمكن حصرها. وقد تتعدد بتعدد الثقافات المعماريه التي حملها خريجو الهندسه الاردنيون من الشرق والغرب وعادوا بعد تخرجهم ليزرعوا ثمارها في جنبات المدينه وما حملوه من مذاهب معماريه متعدده. ويبدو انه كان لتنتشر نتيجه لذلك التشكيل المتعدد فوضى معماريه هائله لولا الاستعمال الموّحد للحجر الاردني في جميع هذه المباني. ادى هذا الى استعمال واسع لحجر البناء الذي توفر بصوره لبّت الحاجه لطبيعه عمّان الجغرافيه والطبوغرافيه كمدينه احيطت بعده جبال شكلت محاجرها رافدًا اساسيًا لتزويد المدينه بالحجاره. ولكن اتساع المدينه المطرد مع الزمن دفعها للبحث عن مصدر للحجاره من اماكن اخرى في المملكه ومن محافظات جنوب الاردن وخصوصا من محافظه معان.\n\nوسط المدينه الجديد\nتم البدء بمشروع العبدلي او مشروع تطوير منطقه العبدلي في عام 2005 وكان متوقعًا الانتهاء منه عام 2010. وسيصبح قلب عمّان الجديد ومركزها. يقوم المشروع على ارض مساحتها 804 كيلومترات مربعه، من مساحه مبنيه تزيد على 1,7 مليون امتار مربعه تضمّ مجمّعات سكنيه ومكاتب وفنادق وشقق مخدومه ومحلات تجاريه ومراكز للترفيه؛ وهو بذلك سيصبح محور الاعمال والسكن في العاصمه الاردنيه عمّان.\nلقد تم تطوير العبدلي ليكون مثابه مركز ذكي للمدينه حيث يجمع سويه البنيه التحتيه لوسائط الاعلام والاتصال، بما يكفل ايصال اكثر التقنيات تطورًا الى كل منزل ومكتب ومتجر، بينما تتوفر فيه حلول طاقه عامه وانظمه غاز مركزيه بما يضمن بيئه سليمه ووديه فضلاً عن التوفير الكبير في فاتوره الطاقه. وسيكون مركز المدينه مجهزًا كليًا بانظمه متطوره تقنيًا لاداره المباني وللحمايه من الحرائق ولاداره السلامه والتدابير الاحتياطيه. ساهم مشروع تطوير العبدلي في ايجاد شبكات طرق وحلول مروريه ممتازه حول المشروع وداخله، بما يؤمّن الانسيابيه لنحو 90,000 شخص يوميًا من السكان والعاملين والزوار عندما يعمل المشروع بكامل طاقته.\n\nدور العباده\nيُشكل المسلمون غالبيه سكان عمان حيث يشكلون ما نسبته 94%، ويشكل المسيحيون النسبه الباقيه اي ما نسبته 6% من السكان من مختلف الطوائف، ويكفل الدستور للجميع حريه ممارسه الاديان، ولذلك تجد في عمان مجموعه متنوعه من المساجد والكنائس موزعه في مختلف انحاء العاصمه اعتني في تصميمها وبناؤها لتتميز وتكمل نسيج المدينه المعماري. لقد تزايد عدد المساجد في الاردن بشكل لافت وملحوظ في الاونه الاخيره وبارقام قياسيه شهدت ارتفاعا كبيرا فاقت دول عربيه واسلاميه مجاوره. وبلغ عدد المساجد العامله في المملكه 6243 مسجدا - بلغت حصه عمّان منها 25%.\n\nيُلاحظ بشكل واضح ان تصميم معظم مساجد المدينه قد تم على الطرازين الاموي والفاطمي، نتيجه للطبيعه الجغرافيه التي حتّمت ان تكون عمّان جزءا من محيطها المعماري والحضاري الممتد من سوريا وفلسطين ولبنان حتى مصر.\nيُشار بالذكر الى ان المهاجرين المسلمين الشركس والشيشان قد ساهموا في بناء اول مساجد المدينه في العصر الحديث منذ نهايه القرن التاسع عشر. وتشهد المساجد الاثريه في مناطق تواجدهم - خاصه في وادي السير وراس العين ووسط البلد على هذا الامر.\nيُعد كل من مسجد ابو درويش، مسجد الملك عبد الله الاول، المسجد الحسيني، مسجد الملك الحسين، مسجد الشريعه، مسجد ابو قوره، مسجد الكالوتي، مسجد الروضه، ومسجد سيدو الكردي من اكبر مساجد المدينه واشهرها. اما بالنسبه للكنائس، فتوجد في عمّان العشرات منها والتي تخدم جميع الطوائف المسيحيه، ومن اهمها: كنيسه دخول السيد الى الهيكل في الصويفيه، كنيسه مطرانيه الروم الكاثوليك، كنيسه قصر البشارات، كنيسه الاقباط، كنيسه البشاره في اللويبده، كنيسه الاتحاد المسيحي الانجيليه في جبل عمّان، كنيسه الراعي الصالح الانجيليه اللوثريه في ام السماق، والكنائس المعمدانيه في الرابيه وابو نصير والشميساني وخلدا وصويلح وغيرها.\n\nالثقافه والفنون\nبدات البوادر الجاده لظهور حركه تشكيليه في عمّان في اوائل الخمسينات من القرن الفائت، ففي عام 1951 اقام «المنتدى العربي» اول معرض جماعي في الاردن. وبعده بسنه، تاسس معهد الموسيقى والرسم في المدينه. وفي اواخر الخمسينيات، ارسلت الحكومه اول مبعوثين اردنيين لدراسه الفن في الخارج، وهم: رفيق اللحام، ومهنا الدره، واحمد نعواش، وكمال بلاطه، والتحق بعضهم باكاديميه الفنون الجميله في روما. وفي عقد الستينيات بدا الموفدون بالعوده الى عمّان، وممارسه فنهم، وتدريس ماده الرسم في المدارس الثانويه، ومع عودتهم ازداد النشاط الفني، وكذلك اخذ عدد المعارض التي كانت تقام في القدس وعمان يتضاعف، والمحاضرات الفنيه كذلك، كما اخذت وزاره السياحه مبادره المشاركه باعمال الفنانين الاردنيين في المعارض الدوليه.\n\nفي عام 1966 تاسست دائره الثقافه والفنون، التابعه لوزاره الاعلام، وهدفها دعم الفنون التشكيليه والمسرحيه والموسيقى والادب وتشجيعها. ومع بدايه السبعينيات تضاعف النشاط الفني في المدينه، ففي عام 1972 اسست دائره الثقافه والفنون «معهد الفنون والموسيقى»، وقد اُريد له ان يكون نواه لاكاديميه فنيه، ومده الدراسه في المعهد سنتان، تعطى فيها دروس في الفن والتصوير والنحت وفن الطباعه والخزف، وقد تخرج منه عدد من الفنانين الاردنيين استطاع بعضهم اكمال دراسته الفنيه العليا في الخارج، معتمدين على التاسيس الذي حصلوا عليه في المعهد.\nلا شك ان الحركه التشكيليه الاردنيه تعتبر من انشط الحركات الفنيه في عمّان قياسا الى الحركه المسرحيه، او الموسيقيه مثلا، فقد شهدت فتره التسعينيات من القرن الماضي والسنوات الماضيه من الالفيه الجديده، نشاطا تشكيليا ملفتا للنظر، وقد تجلى هذا النشاط بغزاره اقامه المعارض الفنيه للفنانين الاردنيين والفنانين العرب والعالميين، وكان واضحا ان هناك ما يشبه الهجره للفنانين العراقيين بوجه خاص الى الاردن منذ بدايه التسعينيات اما للاقامه الدائمه، او المؤقته في طريقهم للخارج، وهذا انعكس حراكا فنيا واضحا على الساحه الاردنيه، وتواصلا بين الفنانين الاردنيين والعراقيين، وجد تعبيراته في ازدياد عدد المعارض الفنيه، وانشاء قاعات العرض الخاصه التي تزايدت اعدادها بشكل كبير، والتي تستقطب تجارب الفنانين الاردنيين والعرب والعالميين مما يشير الى تنامي الوعي الفني وانتشاره بين الجمهور، كما يؤشر الى ازدياد اعداد الفنانين الاردنيين، واقبال العديد من الطلبه على دراسه الفن التشكيلي، مما دفع الى فتح كليه للفنون الجميله في الجامعه الاردنيه في عمان في عام 2003 تدرس من ضمن تخصصاتها الرسم، الجرافيك والتصميم وغيرها من مفردات الفن التشكيلي وتخصصاته المختلفه الى جانب المسرح والموسيقى.\nاما بالنسبه للموسيقى، فكانت حاضره منذ اوائل القرن العشرين، خاصه ان هناك تداخل ما بين الثقافه البدويه والحضريه في المدينه. اما بالنسبه للموسيقى الكلاسيكيه، فهناك اوركسترا وطنيه تتخذ من عمان مقرا لها وهي اوركسترا عمان السيمفوني، التي ولدت من رحم اوركسترا المعهد الوطني للموسيقى (مؤسسه الملك الحسين) وبدعم من امانه عمان الكبرى. قدمت الاوركسترا باكوره حفلاتها في شهر كانون الثاني / يناير 2007. ويزخر الموسم الثقافي السنوي لاوركسترا عمان السمفوني ببرنامج منوع من الحفلات العامه، تقدم في ثالث اربعاء من كل شهر.\n\nعاصمه الثقافه العربيه والاسلاميه\nتشهد عمّان ازديادًا بالانشطه والمهرجانات المحليه والعربيه، وذلك منذ اعلانها عاصمه للثقافه العربيه عام 2002، يبرز من بينها اطلاق مشروع مسرح التراث الموسيقي الاردني، وافتتاح مشغل النحت العربي، ومهرجان عمان للافلام الوثائقيه، والمعرض الشامل للفن التشكيلي العربي، بالاضافه لافتتاح شارع الثقافه،\nمن جهه اخرى، فقد تم اعلان مدينه عمّان عام 2017 عاصمهً للثقافه الاسلاميه عن المنطقه العربيه.\nتنتشر في عمّان عدد كبير من المعارض ومراكز الفنون الجميله وعدّه اسواق شعبيه تعرض اسهامات الفنانين في وسط البلد وجبل عمان وجبل اللويبده، حيث شهدت هذه الاماكن حراكا ثقافيا نوعيّا في العقدين الاخيرين، زمن اشهر تلك المراكز؛ داره الفنون، دار الاندى، محترف رمال للفنون وكثير من المعارض الاخرى. ويجدر بالذكر الى ان وزاره الثقافه في الاردن قد تبنت مؤخرا تجربه المدن الثقافيه، او مايطلق عليه عاصمه الثقافه الاردنيه - كما حدث في اربد والسلط والكرك والزرقاء ومعان تباعا، مما اتاح قدر اكبر للانفتاح الثقافي والادبي على المدن الاردنيه الباقيه وعدم حصرها بالعاصمه، والتي سبق لها ان نالت لقب عاصمه الثقافه العربيه.\n\nوسط عمّان الثقافي\nتتضمن منطقه راس العين الكثير من المرافق الثقافيه التي تكمل دور امانه عمان الكبرى في احياءها ابتداءً من مسجد النورين وساحه النوافير وساحه النخيل ومن ثم قاعه المدينه ومبنى موظفي امانه عمان الكبرى وانتهاءً بمركز الحسين الثقافي، حيث تبلغ مساحه المشروع حوالي (20) دونماً من اصل مساحه الساحه البالغه (143) دونماً. وتتضمن هذه المساحه على مقر الامانه، متحف الاردن، مسرح مركز الحسين الثقافي، المعهد الوطني للموسيقى، بالاضافه الى سوق الحرف الشعبيه. وكان مُقررًا ايضًا ان يُنفذ مشروع دار للاوبرا في هذه المنطقه، هي داره الملك عبد الله الثاني للثقافه والفنون، الا انه توقف وتم تحويله الى سوق شعبي في عام 2014.\nتحوي عمّان على عدد لا باس به من المتاحف، مثل المتحف الوطني للفنون الجميله، متحف الازياء الشعبيه، متحف صرح الشهيد، متحف الحياه البرلمانيه، متحف الاثار الاردني، متحف الاطفال، متحف السيارات الملكي، القريه الثقافيه في حدائق الحسين، بالاضافه الى عدد كبير من المراكز الثقافيه الاجنبيه.\nيوجد في جبل عمان ايضًا، سوق مختص بالحرف اليدويه والثقافه الشعبيه، يُدعى سوق جارا، وهو سوق موسمي يبدا اسبوعيًا في كل يوم جمعه خلال شهر ايار/مايو، وينتهي في شهر تشرين الاول/اكتوبر. تُقيمه سنويا رابطه سكان جبل عمان. يرتاده السياح بكثره خلال فصل الصيف.\nمن الجدير بالذكر الى ان المدينه تستضيف كل عام مهرجانات ثقافيه عالميه ومحليه؛ من اهمها معرض الكتاب العالمي، مهرجان ايام عمان المسرحيه، مهرجان الاردن، مهرجان الموسيقى والغناء الصوفي، مهرجان صيف عمان، مهرجان عمان للرقص المعاصر ومهرجان عمان للكوميديا، وغيرها.\n\nالاعلام\nمعظم الصحف الاردنيه الكبرى ومراكز البث موجوده في عمّان. كما تُشكل المدينه مركزا اعلاميًا للصحفيين الدوليين الاتين لتغطيه اخبار المنطقه المتجدده سواء في فلسطين، العراق وسوريا، او في مناطق قريبه اخرى.\nتاسست في عمّان عام 1969 وكاله الانباء الاردنيه، وهي وكاله الانباء الرسميه في الاردن. كما تاسست المدينه الاعلاميه الاردنيه في عام 2001، وهي الاولى من نوعها في منطقه بلاد الشام، والتي يُؤمل منها ان تجعل من عمّان محورا رئيسيا لشبكات البث الفضائي. يوجد الانالكثير من المحطات التي ترسل بثها منها. تحاول عمّان اليوم منافسه مدن اخرى ذات الخبره والامكانيات في مجال الاعلام مثل بيروت ودبي والقاهره. وقد تاسس في 2003 الهيئه الملكيه الاردنيه للافلام، وهي مؤسسه تقدم الدعم لانتاج الافلام والمسلسلات التلفزيونيه في الاردن وتدريب الناشئه وصانعي الافلام والمهنيين من الاردن والمنطقه في جميع مجالات السينما والانتاج التلفزيوني. تقدم الهيئه برامج وورش تدريبيه على مدار السنه، من اجل بناء صناعه افلام حديثه ورائده ذات مستوى عالمي في الاردن، بحيث يتمكن جميع صانعي الافلام في الشرق الاوسط انتاج افلام بحريه جنباً الى جنب اكثر فناني العالم موهبه.\n\nالاقتصاد\nكانت الليره العثمانيه هي العمله المتداوله في عمّان اثناء الحكم العثماني. استمر ذلك حتى اُنشئت اماره شرق الاردن تحت وصايه الانتداب البريطاني، فتم استخدام الجنيه المصري بشكل مؤقت الى ان اصدر الجنيه الفلسطيني عام 1927 حيث اعتمد في الدوله واستخدم حتى مطلع الخمسينيات من القرن الماضي، عندما صدر الدينار الاردني وصار هو العمله الرسميه. كما يُستخدم الدولار الامريكي واليورو الى جانب الدينار في عمليات البيع والشراء. ما زال سكان عمّان يستخدمون كلمه الليره رغم تعاملهم بالدينار نتيجه للتاثر الطويل بالعثمانيين الذين حكموا بلاد الشام قرابه 4 قرون.\n\nتُعتبر عمّان اليوم مركزًا للحياه الاقتصاديه في الاردن، الذي انتعش اقتصاده برجوع رؤوس الاموال والمستثمرين من الكويت والخليج سنه 1990 حيث بدات خطط التنميه تلقى طريقها في المدينه من انشاء مشاريع كثيره. ويعتمد اقتصاد المدينه على قطاعات البناء والبنوك والتامين والتجاره وبشكل كبير على قطاع السياحه والفندقه، بالاضافه للصناعات الغذائيه والخفيفه والمتوسطه. تتخذ كبرى الشركات الاردنيه وعدد من الشركات الاقليميه والعالميه في المنطقه من المدينه مقرا لها. كذلك يمتلك العديد من مواطني دول الخليج العربي وكبار اثرياء العرب عقارات واعمال في عمّان الغربيه. في العقدين الاخيرين قامت العديد من الشركات الخليجيه والعربيه والعالميه بالاستثمار في عمّان تتصدرها الشركات الكويتيه.\nاحتلت عمّان في عام 2007 المرتبه الاولى بين المدن العربيه من حيث غلاء المعيشه فيها - حسب «مجله الايكونومست البريطانيه». حيث ان ارتفاع اسعار المساكن والعقارات والاراضي، الى جانب ارتفاع اسعار النفط الذي اثر على كلف الانتاج وزياده قيمه المستوردات، عوامل ساهمت في تربع عمّان على صداره قائمه اغلى المدن عربيا.\n\nبورصه عمان وغرفه تجاره عمّان\nتاسست بورصه عمان في عام 1999 كمؤسسه مستقله تُدار من قبل القطاع الخاص لمزاوله العمل كسوق منظم لتداول الاوراق الماليه في المملكه. تقوم البورصه بتوفير انظمه الكترونيه ووسائل ربط وقاعات مجهزه بالادوات والوسائل التقنيه الحديثه. ومراقبه عمليات التداول في السوق والتنسيق مع الهيئه في متابعه تلك العمليات. كما قامت بوضع معايير للسلوك المهني لضمان التزام اعضائها بمبادئ التداول السليم، كما تحرص على ضروره النشر الفوري والصحيح للمعلومات لجميع المهتمين بنفس الوقت. اما غرفه تجاره عمّان تتكون من 12 عضوا منتخبين عن طريق الاقتراع الحر والمباشر من قبل اعضاء الهيئه العامه للغرفه البالغ عددهم حوالي 35,000 عضو، ومده عضويه المجلس 4 سنوات، وتهدف الغرفه الى قياده القطاع التجاري نحو مستقبل افضل للاعمال واقتصاد وطني حر.\n\nالاسواق\nازدهرت حركه التجاره في عمان منذ القدم، ففيها عده اسواق قديمه، وهي كالاتي: سوق السكر، وسوق البخاريه، وسوق الجمعه، وسوق وادي السرور، وسوق الخضار، وسوق اليمنيه، وسوق الحبوب، وسوق الحلال، وسوق الصاغه، وسوق السعاده، وسوق الانتيكا، وسوق البناء الحديث. بالنسبه الى سوق البخاريه القديم، الذي نسج خيوط الحكايه لشيخ من بخاري قدم الى عمان كغيره من التجار فاسس هذا السوق القديم في ساحه شرقي المسجد الحسيني الحالي عام 1934 وبقي السوق في موقعه الى عام 1954 وبعدها نقل الى عماره فوزي المفتي في شارع الملك طلال مقابل المسجد الحسيني تتوزع عشرات المحلات التجاريه حسب نوعيه البضائع التي يبيعها السوق. ويمكن تصنيفها الى محال لبيع ادوات ومستلزمات الحلاقين، وادوات ومستلزمات الخياطه والتطريز، ومستلزمات مشاغل الخياطه والكلف، وهناك محال لبيع الاكسسوارات والمنسوجات والعطاره، ومحال لبيع العطور والبخورات.\nوعلى الرغم من هذا التنوع التجاري لواقع العاصمه عمان بين الاسواق القديمه والمولات الحديثه والتي تختلف في الشكل والمحتوى تبقى ظاهره انتشار البسطات بمختلف انواعها ومحتوياتها موجوده في شوارع الاسواق داخل عمان.\nومن اكبر مراكز التسوق الحديثه في المدينه، ستي مول، مكه مول، تاج مول، عمّان مول، غاليريا مول.\n\nالصناعه\nاتبعت امانه عمان الكبرى بالتعاون مع وزاره الصناعه والتجاره المعايير في تحديد المناطق الصناعيه. وعليه قامت امانه عمان الكبرى باجراء دراسه مكثفه وتحليل لخيارات المواقع الملائمه لتاهيلها لتكون المناطق الصناعيه كالتالي:\n\nمنطقه سحاب – وممر الموقر: تمّ تصنيف هذه المنطقه كمنطقه صناعات خفيفه ومتوسطه مع الاخذ بعين الاعتبار الصناعات القائمه حاليا في هذه المنطقه وتوفير بعد جغرافي عن المناطق السكنيه في منطقه الموقر والنقيره.\nمنطقه القسطل الصناعيه: مع الاخذ بعين الاعتبار الوضع الصناعي الحالي في منطقه القسطل ياتي تحديد هذه المنطقه جنوب شرق طريق المطار حيث تم تصنيف هذه المنطقه للصناعات المتخصصه كصناعات الابحاث والاعمال والتقنيات. اما بقيه الاراضي في هذه المنطقه فقد تم تصنيفها صناعات خفيفه ومتوسطه لتكون مسانده للصناعات المتخصصه في نفس المنطقه وايضا تسمح هذه المنطقه بتوفير مناطق جغرافيه واسعه للمد الصناعي.\nمنطقه الجيزه الصناعيه: تمّ تحديد المنطقه جنوبي الجيزه كمنطقه صناعات متوسطه وخفيفه مع الاخذ بعين الاعتبار الصناعات القائمه حاليا في تلك المنطقه. حيث ستكون هذه المنطقه منطقه جذب للعماله بسبب المشاريع السكنيه التي ستقام بالقرب منها، كمشروع تعمير للاسكان.\nهذا وتوجد عده مناطق صناعيه، تحوي على عدد من الوكالات وكثير من محلات تصليح السيارات، متوزعه على اطراف العاصمه، كما في البيادر الى الجنوب الغربي، وصافوط الى الشمال الغربي، وماركا الى الشمال الشرقي، ووادي الرمم الى الشرق، والوحدات الى الجنوب من المدينه.\n\nالزراعه\nاشتهرت مدينه عمان بانتمائها الى منطقه خصبه وافره الغلال، فقد وصفتها المصادر القديمه ومنها التوراه بكثره المياه «مدينه المياه»، كما ان الجغرافيين والمؤرخين العرب نعتوا منطقه عمان بالخصب والنماء وكثره الغلات. ومما اشتهرت به عمان: الحبوب الكثيره خصوصاً القمح، فوصفت بانها معدن الحبوب، حتى ضرب المثل بجوده حنطتها، وقد راينا انها والصلت كانت تزود القدس وبعض المدن الفلسطينيه بالقمح بعدما حررها صلاح الدين من الصليبيين، فاشترط صلاح الدين على اخيه - التي كانت ضمن اقطاعه بان يرسل القمح ففعل.\nواشتهرت عمان ايضا بالخراف الجيده السمينه والعسل اللذيذ وانتشرت حولها كروم الاعناب العديد التي استخرجوا منها الخمور وعملوا منها الزبيب، وكذلك اشجار التين الكثيره ومنها عملوا القطين، التين المجفف، كما اشتهرت بالفواكه الكثيره واشجار البطم وغيره.\nوقد وصفت منطقه البلقاء في العصور الوسطى بانها ذات قرى ومزارع وارضها زكيه طيبه حتى ان قراها بلغت نيفاً وثلاثمائه قريه، اما مزارعها فهي واسعه منتشره نذكر منها مزرعه لابي سفيان زعيم قريش، واخرى ليوسف بن عمرو والي العراق. كذلك اشتهرت جاديه احدى قرى البلقاء بزراعه الزعفران - الورس- وكانت له اهميته اذ ذاك لاستعماله في الصباغه وصدر للخارج لان الاوروبيين كانوا يستعملونه كدواء ايضاً. كما صدرت عمان نبات الرواند، وهو عباره عن عروق خشبيه مستديره في غلظ الاصابع وسمي الروابد الشامي او رواند الدواب لان البياطره يسقونه للدواب اذا احترت اكبادها. وهو غير الرواند الصيني الذي يشبه القلقاس ويستعمل في علاج الانسان، كاوجاع الكبد والكلى والمغص.\nاما نهرها الصغير الذي ذكره الجغرافيون، فقد اقيمت عليه في العصور المختلفه الحمامات لخدمه سكانها، وفي خارجها اقيمت عليه الارحيه لطحن الدقيق وكانت هذه الرحيه تخدم سكان القرى المجاوره فيقصدون عمان من اجل طحن دقيقهم هذا بالاضافه الى الزراعات والخضر المختلفه التي تقوم على ضفافه لخدمه سكان المدينه العريقه.\n\nالسياحه\nتشهد عمّان في فصل الصيف ازديادًا كبيرًا في عدد السيّاح، وخصوصًا من الدول العربيه. حيث يساعد المناخ المتوسطي المعتدل في جذب هذه الفئه، بالاضافه الى اقامه العديد من المهرجانات الثقافيه والنشاطات الفنيه المختلفه. ويوجد عدد لاباس به من الاماكن لزيارتها في المدينه كالمناطق السياحيه والمصايف واماكن الترفيه، بالاضافه الى المواقع التاريخيه الهامه التي تحكي قصه المدينه، واهمها المدرج الروماني وقلعه عمّان ورجم الملفوف العمّوني. كما تحوي المدينه الكثير من المطاعم والمقاهي التي تقدم الاطعمه الشرقيه والغربيه خاصه تلك التي تقع في اطراف العاصمه وخارجها وسط الغابات والاشجار الحرجيه كجبال عجلون ودبين ومرتفعات الرمان وتحتوي معظم هذه المطاعم والمتنزهات على ملاعب للاطفال او برك للسباحه مما يجعلها متعه حقيقيه لجميع افراد الاسره. وتنتشر في عمان والمدن الاردنيه الاخرى اسواق الحرف والصناعه التقليديه من المنسوجات والمطرزات والازياء والحلي والمجوهرات والخزفيات والزجاج كما تتوفر مراكز التسوق الكبيره التي تحتوي على المحلات التجاريه المتعدده وتعرض الملابس الحديثه لدور الازياء العالميه.\n\nيقع في عمّان الكثير من النوادي الرياضيه المتخصصه كنوادي ركوب الخيل والسباحه والنوادي الصحيه التي يستطيع الزائر قضاء وقت مفيد وممتع فيها كما تقام اثناء فصل الصيف نواد صيفيه متعدده الغايات المغامرات والغطس والسباحه والكمبيوتر يشارك فيها الاطفال والشباب العرب الزوار الى جانب الاردنيين لممارسه رياضاتهم المختلفه. كما تنتشر المدن الترويحيه والمتنزهات والحدائق العامه وصالات العاب تسليه الاطفال.\nمن اهم المناطق التي يرتادها السياح، مناطق شارع الثقافه وعبدون وشارع الوكالات وسوق الصويفيه وسوق الرابيه وشارع مكه وشارع المدينه المنوره وشارع الجامعه الاردنيه وسوق جبل اللويبده وشارع الرينبو وسوق جبل الحسين وسوق ام اذينه، ومناطق وسط البلد بطبيعه الحال. وتحوي هذه المناطق على جمله من المطاعم والمقاهي المتنوعه ذات الطابع الشرقي والغربي، فبالاضافه للمطاعم الاردنيه، يمكن للسائح ان يرى العديد من المطاعم اللبنانيه والايطاليه والفرنسيه والتركيه والصينيه والهنديه ومطاعم الوجبات السريعه الامريكيه ومطاعم عراقيه ويمنيه وخليجيه اخرى.\nشهدت عمّان في 9 تشرين الثاني/ نوفمبر 2005 فيما يعرف شعبيًا بيوم «الاربعاء الاسود» الذي مثّل ضربه عنيفه للسياحه في المدينه والبلاد بشكل عام، حيث ادت عده عمليات انتحاريه ارهابيه الى تفجير بتفجير ثلاثه من فنادقها، قُتل فيها ثلاثه من المهاجمين والقي القبض على الرابع وهي سيده. اودت الانفجارات بحياه 65 من المدنيين، ومنهم المخرج السوري مصطفى العقاد وابنته، واصابه الكثيرين بجروج، مما اثر الى حد كبير على سكانها ووفود السياح اليها ولكنها بتشديد الامن واتخاذ الاجراءات المناسبه سرعان ما استعادت وضعها السابق حيث اخذت تستقبل الزائرين طوال العام وخاصه في فصل الصيف عند عوده المغتربين وزياره السائحين والمصطافين وزياده الفعاليات الترفيهيه والثقافيه كمهرجان جرش سابقا ومهرجان الاردن حاليا ومهرجان صيف عمان.\n\nالفنادق\nيوجد في عمّان ما لا يقل عن 36 فندق من فئه الاربعه والخمسه نجوم معظمها انشئ في عمان الغربيه، والعديد منها يتبع سلسله فنادق عالميه مثل فندق انتركونتيننتال الاردن والفور سيزنز والميريديان والغراند حياه والراديسون ساس والشيراتون. ويتميز فندق الرويال في عمّان بعمارته الفريده، اذ يظهر في افق المدينه وكانه قلعه تعلو جبل عمان.\n\nالمعالم الاثريه\nوتتمتع عمّان بثروه من المعالم الاثريه الشهيره ما زالت شاهده على حضارات قديمه استوطنت المدينه، فعلى جبل القلعه الذي يعلو المدينه القديمه يرتفع «هيكل هرقل» الذي بناه الرومان في القرن الثاني الميلادي على بقايا معبد عموني قديم، الى جانب متحف الاثار الذي يحتوي على معروضات عديده من مختلف الحضارات وادوات تمثل حياه الانسان في هذه العهود القديمه. وفي وسط المدينه يقع سبيل الحوريات، وعلى مقربه من السبيل ينتصب المدرج الروماني الكبير الذي يتسع لخمسه الاف متفرج، وغيرها من المعالم التي تُستغل حتى اليوم في فعاليات ثقافيه وفنيه عديده، وهي من المراكز التي يستغلها مهرجان الاردن وينظم فيها فعالياته:\n\nمنتزهات واماكن ترفيهيه ورياضيه\nرُوعي في التخطيط المدني للمدينه تنوّع الاماكن الترفيهيه في نوعيتها واماكن وجودها، وهناك محاولات حثيثه لزيادتها. ومعظم الجديد منها ينشا على اطراف المدينه على جانبي الطريق الدائري لتسهيل الوصول اليها.\n\nالسياحه الطبيه\nتصل عوائد السياحه الطبيه الى 700 مليون دولار امريكي في العام، حسب تصريحات البنك الدولي فالاردن هي الاولى في المنطقه والخامسه على مستوى العالم في هذا المجال. هناك عدد من المستشفيات الحكوميه والخاصه في عمّان، التي يرتادها المرضى العرب من دول الخليج العربي والعراق واليمن ودول المغرب العربي. وان ما يجذب المرضى هو اجراءات تخفيض الاسعار والجوده العاليه عن العلاج في اوروبا والولايات المتحده الامريكيه. والساحه الطبيه في عمّان تتميز بمهاره وخبره متميزه في مجال امراض وجراحه القلب وكذلك تطبيق الكثير من الجراحات الدقيقه فيما يخص العيون والكلى والرئتين.\n\nالصحه\nالمستشفيات\nشهدت عمّان مع تاسيس اماره شرق الاردن في بدايه العشرينات من القرن العشرين، نهضه طبيه تمثلت بتاسيس عدد من المستشفيات الحكوميه، التي كان اولها مستشفى البلديه ثم المستشفى الحكومي عام 1926. ثم تلى تلك الفتره تاسيس المستشفيات الخاصه، كان اولها مستشفى ملحس في جبل عمّان، وتحديًدا عام 1944. وظلت عمّان تطور من بنيتها التحتيه الطبيه خلال العقود اللاحقه، حيث تم تشييد مدينه الحسين الطبيه عام 1973، والتي تُعد اول مدينه طبيه عربيه.\nكما شهدت الخدمات الصحيه في فتره التسعينات، توسعًا كميًا ونوعيًا على كافه الاصعده والقطاعات الطبيه العامله في هذا المجال الحكومي منه والقطاع الخاص. فقد شهد القطاع الخاص بعد عام 1990 نموًا مضطردًا في عدد المستشفيات كان اهمها المستشفى التخصصي ومستشفى الاردن ومستشفى الاستقلال ومستشفى الاسراء ومستشفى الامير حمزه، وغيرها الكثير من المستشفيات التي حصلت على الاعتماديه الدوليه من منظمه الصحه العالميه.\nغير ان اهم تلك الانجازات تمثل بتشييد مركز عالمي متخصص بمعالجه مرض السرطان، هو مركز الحسين للسرطان، الذي تم تاسيسه عام 1997، ليكون اول مركز متخصص في علاج السرطان يحصل على الاعتماد الخاص بامراض السرطان خارج الولايات المتحده الاميركيه.\n\nالجدول التالي يظهر اهم المستشفيات الموجوده في عمّان:\n\nالتعليم والتعليم العالي\nتعود بدايات التعليم في مدينه عمّان الى فتره الحرب العالميه الاولى، وتحديدا عام 1916، عند افتتاح مدرسه دار النجاح، والتي كان موقعها خلف المسجد الحسيني الكبير، كان التعليم في المدرسه باللغه التركيه ما عدا درس الدين الذي كان يدرس باللغه العربيه، وكان يطلق على المدرسه اسم اخر اكثر استعمالا وشيوعا وهو «المكتب الحربي» لان الخريجين كانوا يتاهلون للالتحاق بالكليه الحربيه في الاستانيه - اسطنبول.\nشهدت المدينه خلال حقبه الخمسينات والستينات من القرن الفائت طفره نوعيه في مجال التعليم ومن ثم التعليم العالي، بتاسيس الجامعه الاردنيه. كما ان هذه الطفره قد زادت بشكل ملحوظ في عقدي الثمانينات والتسعينات، وقد شهد قطاع التعليم الخاص ازدهارا ملحوظا حيث كانت عمّان هي السباقه فيه في منطقه الشرق الاوسط.\n\nكليات ومدارس\nفي يوليو / تموز 2003، اطلقت الحكومه الاردنيه برنامجا طموحا في منطقه الشرق الاوسط وشمال افريقيا كلها، وهو برنامج اصلاح التعليم من اجل الاقتصاد القائم على المعرفه وهو برنامج متعدد المانحين مدته عشر سنوات، وقدم البنك الدولي لهذا البرنامج 120 مليون دولار امريكي. وسعى البرنامج الى اعاده توجيه السياسات والبرامج التعليميه بما يتماشى مع حاجات اقتصاد قائم على المعرفه، وتحسين بيئه التعليم الماديه في معظم المدارس، وتشجيع التعليم في سنوات الطفوله المبكره. وامتدت المرحله الاولى للبرنامج من 2003 الى 2009 واختتمت في يونيو/حزيران 2009.\nوالمدارس في عمّان اما عامه او خاصه. ويخدم قطاع التعليم الخاص اكثر من 31.14 في المائه من الطلبه في عمان. ولا يزال هذا القطاع يتحمل ضرائب باهظه تصل الى 25 في المائه، مع انه يتحمل عبئا كبيرا عن كاهل حكومه المملكه، الامر الذي يجعل الرسوم الدراسيه مرتفعه نسبيا، اذ تبدا من 1000 دولار وتصل الى 7000 دولار، وتعتبر قيمه رسوم التعليم الخاص مرتفعه للغايه عند مقارنتها بدخل الاسر في المتوسط.\nمن اشهر مدارس المدينه؛ الكليه العلميه الاسلاميه، مدارس المطران، مدرسه الفرير، مدرسه راهبات الورديه، كليه الحسين، مدرسه راهبات الناصره، المدارس العمريه، مدرسه اليوبيل، مدرسه البطريركيه اللاتينيه وغيرها الكثير.\nيشار بالذكر الى انه مبادره التعليم في الاردن قد حصلت في الاونه الاخيره على جائزه اليونسكو لاستخدام تكنولوجيا المعلومات والاتصالات في التعليم. ويستند هذا المشروع التعليمي الرائد في مدارس الاردن على الاستفاده من قوه المعلومات والتكنولوجيا من خلال طرق تدريس مجربه لتغيير بيئه التعلم في المدارس.\nبالاضافه الى ذلك توجد العديد من الكليّات الخاصه والمعاهد التي تمنح شهادات الدبلوم في معظم التخصصات:\nمثل كليه القدس، الاكاديميه العربيه للعلوم الماليه والمصرفيه، كليه طلال ابوغزاله لاداره الاعمال، الكليه الجامعيه المتوسطه والاكاديميه الملكيه للطيران وكليات اخرى.\n\nجامعات\nبالنسبه للتعليم العالي، او الجامعي، فتشمل عمّان عدد كبير من الجامعات قياسا لعدد السكان بالمدينه سواء على المستوى الخاص او الحكومي، مثل الجامعه الاردنيه، جامعه العلوم التطبيقيه، جامعه البتراء، الجامعه الالمانيه الاردنيه، جامعه الاميره سميه للتكنولوجيا، جامعه الزيتونه، جامعه الاسراء، جامعه العلوم الاسلاميه العالميه، جامعه الشرق الاوسط، بعض كليات جامعه البلقاء التطبيقيه، وجامعات اخرى.\nيُقبل الحائزين على شهاده الثانويه العامه في الجامعات الحكوميه او الخاصه او الكليّات. تطبق معظم الجامعات في عمّان والاردن بشكل عام النموذج الامريكي الجامعي القائم على نظام الساعات (بالانجليزيه: Credit Hours) الذي يمنح الطلبه المرونه لاختيار عدد الساعات واوقات الدوام الصباحي او المسائي. هنالك جامعتان حكوميتان مرتبطه بجامعات في الولايات المتحده والمملكه المتحده. هنالك ايضا اكثر من 5 جامعات خاصه مُعترف بها على مستوى الدول العربيه، وبعض الجامعات الاجنبيه كجامعه نيويورك والجامعه الالمانيه الاردنيه. تستقطب الجامعات الاردنيه في عمّان وغيرها من المدن الاردنيه كل عام عدد كبير من الطلبه الاجانب العرب وغير العرب.\n\nالبحث العلمي\nلدى الاردن اكبر عدد من الباحثين في مجال البحوث والتطوير لكل مليون شخص بين كل البلدان السبعه والخمسين الاعضاء في منظمه التعاون الاسلامي (OIC) وهو من اعلى المعدلات في العالم حيث يوجد في الاردن 8060 باحث لكل مليون شخص، بينما المتوسط العالمي يبلغ 2532، والمتوسط في الاتحاد الاوروبي يبلغ 6494، في حين ان المتوسط في البلدان الاعضاء في منظمه التعاون الاسلامي يبلغ 649 باحث لكل مليون شخص.\nوتحوي عمّان على كثير من المراكز العريقه في مجال البحث العلمي بجميع فروعه، ومن اهم تلك المراكز؛ الجمعيه العلميه الملكيه (المؤسسه عام 1970)، التي تهدف الى تطوير التعاون العلمي والتكنولوجي مع مؤسسات مماثله في جميع انحاء العالم.\nكذلك بالنسبه للمركز الجغرافي الملكي الاردني، حيث يعتبر هذا المركز (المؤسس عام 1975) من المراكز المتقدمه على الصعيدين الاقليمي والدولي في مجال العلوم المساحيه وانتاج الخرائط والدراسات والابحاث التطبيقيه المستنده الى معطيات الصور الفضائيه والجويه. عمل المركز منذ انشائه على توفير الكفاءات المدربه في مجال المساحه والخرائط وما يتعلق بهما من علوم كالاستشعار عن بعد والخرائط الرقميه والجيوديزيا الفضائيه، وتم ذلك من خلال التاهيل خارج المملكه في الدول المتقدمه، وداخل المملكه في كليه المركز الجغرافي الملكي الاردني للعلوم المساحيه، والتي لم يقتصر التدريب فيها على الاردنيين، بل شمل العديد من ابناء الدول العربيه الاخرى.\nكما ان هناك كثير من الجمعيات والمراكز الاخرى المهتمه بمجالات مختلفه، منها الطب والطاقه والهندسه والفنون وغيرها.\n\nالرياضه\nتعد عمّان من اكثر المدن العربيه في اسيا اهتماما بالشباب والرياضه بشكل عام، ويتجلى ذلك في عدد المجمعات والمدن الرياضيه المخصصه للشباب، مما اثر ايجابا على مشاركات الاردن في بطولات عربيه واقليميه ودوليه كثيره وخاصه على مستوى كره القدم وكره السله، اللتان تلقيا اقبالا واهتماما كبيرا من قبل الشباب الاردني. كذلك العاب الدفاع عن النفس والسباحه وكره التنس واليد والفروسيه كلها العاب يقبل عليها الشباب في هذه المدينه بشغف. كما ساهم المجلس الاعلى للشباب بتنميه قدرات الشباب من جميع النواحي الحياتيه عن طريق نشر مراكز الشباب في مختلف محافظات المملكه.\nمن اكثر الانديه شعبيه بين الجمهور العمّاني على مستوى كره القدم، هي انديه الوحدات (يتخد من ستاد القويسمه الدولي في الوحدات مقرا له) والفيصلي (يتخد من ستاد عمان الدولي مقرا له) بالاضافه الى انديه اخرى مثل نادي البقعه. كما يلقى نادي زين والنادي الارثوذكسي ونادي التطبيقيه ونادي الارينا... الخ اهتماما كبير من قبل الجمهور ومشجعي كره السله الاردنيه.\n\nالمدينه الرياضيه\nكان هناك استشعار للقياده الاردنيه منذ منتصف الستينات في القرن الفائت، بحاجه الشباب الاردني لانشاء مركز ريادي يخدم الشباب في كافه المجالات لابراز قدراتهم وابداعاتهم ومواكبه التقدم والتطور مما يعكس صوره مشرقه عن الاردن وشعبه، فتبلورت فكره انشاء مدينه للشباب التي اصبحت رائده المدن الرياضيه في الشرق الاوسط. تقع المدينه الرياضيه او مدينه الحسين للشباب في قلب العاصمه عمان، وتمتد على قطعه ارض تبلغ مساحتها حوالي 1200 دونم تغطي الاشجار ثلث مساحتها، بينما تحتل المنشات الرياضيه والملاعب والحدائق العامه والمواقف باقي مساحتها. تم البدء بانشاء المدينه عام 1964 واستغرق ذلك حوالي اربع سنوات.\n\nمشاكل\nالغلاء\nتعاني مدينه عمّان من الارتفاع المستمر في الاسعار، اذ تصدرت اغلى مدن الشرق الاوسط وشمال افريقيا من ناحيه التكلفه المعيشيه وفقًا لمجله الايكونومست البريطانيه ـ في عاميّ 2007 و 2015. واشار التقرير الى ان العاصمه الاردنيه تقدمت اربع مراتب في لائحه المدن الاغلى بالكلفه المعيشيه لتحتل المرتبه الـ48 عالميًا للعام 2015، من المرتبه 52 للعام 2014، لتصبح بذلك ضمن قائمه اغلى خمسين مدينه على مستوى العالم، من بين 133 مدينه شملها التقرير.\n\nالعشوائيات\nادّت الزياده غير المتوقعه في عدد السكان في المدينه نتيجه الحروب المتلاحقه في المنطقه، الى عدم تبنّي المخطط الشمولي الذي تم وضعه عام 1956، والذي يُعتبر اول مخطط هيكلي لعمّان بمعناه الصحيح، والذي حدد شكل المدينه ووظائفها والاستعمالات المختلفه وخطوط النقل والمواصلات وغيرها من الخصائص العامه. تعاني معظم احياء مدينه عمّان اليوم من النمو العشوائي حتى في الاحياء الراقيه، بالرغم من تصنيفها الى مناطق ا، ب، ج،... الخ بناءً على عوامل عمرانيه وتنظيميه خاصه بقوانين امانه عمان الكبرى. حيث ان تقسيمات الكثير من قطع الاراضي عشوائيه ومتداخله. كذلك ينتشر عدد ليس بقليل من الاسكانات بشكل غير مدروس، حيث انها تتمدد باتجاهات غير منظمه مما يؤدي الى عشوائيه في الخدمات حيث يسكن السكان. بالاضافه الى ضئاله المناطق الخضراء بالنسبه للمباني، وما تبقّى منها يتاكل بسرعه لتحل محله الاسكانات. اما الحدائق العامه فهي محدوده للغايه.\nعلى الرغم من ذلك، قد بدات عمّان مؤخرًا بالتوسع بشكل مدروس لم تشهده المدينه من قبل، حيث نالت خطه مدينه عمان الشموليه جوائز عالميه، منها جائزه القياده العالميه في تخطيط المدن وجائزه المدينه عن قاره اسيا لعام 2007.\n\nالازمه المروريه\nادت الظروف السياسيه المتلاحقه بالمنطقه وتبعاتها المتمثله بموجات اللجوء من المناطق المجاوره للاردن بشكل كبير وفجائي عبر العقود الماضيه، بالاضافه الى عوده الاف المغتربين في الخارج، الى ازدياد عدد سكان المدينه بشكل كبير وغير مدروس، والذي اثر بدوره على شبكه الطرق المتواضعه اصلاً. حيث تعاني المدينه من انعدام التخطيط المستقبلي لشوارعها التي لم يُراعى في انشاءها هذا العدد الكبير من المستخدمين. فالطرق في عمّان في معظمها غير قابله للتوسعه لاستيعاب الكم المتزايد للمركبات، بالاضافه الى التلكؤ الحكومي في ايجاد حلول جذريه للمشكله.\nمن جانب اخر، تُعد عمّان من اقل مدن العالم استخدامًا لوسائل النقل العام، حيث لا يستخدم هذه الوسائل سوى 14% (2010) من العدد الاجمالي للسكان في المدينه. وقد اشارت اخر الاحصائيات الى ان هناك اكثر من مليون سياره تسير في عمّان، معظمها لنقل شخص واحد. ونتيجه لهذه المشاكل، تحاول الحكومه في ايجاد حلول بديله عن استخدام المركبات، حيث يُعد مشروع الباص السريع اهمها. فيما اعلنت عن خطط على المدى البعيد تتمثل بانشاء خطوط للترام او المترو بموازاه الباص السريع الذي يُعد حل ضروري واني بسبب الاختناق المروري الذي تعاني منه المدينه، وخصوصًا صيفًا.\n\nسوء توزيع الخدمات\nتعاني عمّان كمعظم المدن العربيه بتعدد الانماط الحياتيه والعمرانيه بين احياءها القديمه والحديثه. لكن المختلف في عمّان يرتبط بنشاتها واصلها القروي وطابعها الريفي. فالجزء الشرقي من المدينه هو الجزء الاقدم والاكثر كثافه بالسكان، يعاني بشكل عام وواضح من سوء توزيع الخدمات وقله تواجد المؤسسات الحكوميه الكبرى، التي تتركز معظمها في الجزء الغربي.\nبالاضافه الى ذلك، فان النمط العمراني في عمّان الشرقيه يتسم بتراص الابنيه السكنيه المبنيه على الاغلب من الطوب. بينما الابراج التي تضم كبرى الشركات والفنادق والمجمعات التجاريه باتت تحتل مساحات كبيره من عمان الغربيه التي يتميز البناء فيها بانه مكسي بالحجر الكلسي.\nولا ينتهي الامر عند خصائص العمران والمستوى الاجتماعي والمعيشي للسكان، بل يتعداه الى التخطيط المدني والهندسي، فالشوارع والارصفه في شرق عمّان بشكل عام ضيقه وقليله الصيانه بعكس الكثير من شوارع عمّان الغربيه. كما ان مستوى النظافه في غرب عمّان يظهر بشكل واضح عند المقارنه مع احياء المدينه القديمه التي تتكدس الاوساخ على جوانب شوارعها وحاوياتها، بالاضافه الى مشاكل الصرف الصحي.\nمن جهه اخرى، تعاني معظم احياء عمّان الشرقيه من التهميش الثقافي وندره في النشاطات الاجتماعيه الموجوده في عمّان الغربيه. بالاضافه الى التهميش الاجتماعي، حيث يُلاحظ بشكل كبير ان عمان مقسومه الى شطرين، يقع الشطر الاول في الناحيه الغربيه واغلب سكانه من الاغنياء المُترفين، اما الشطر الثاني فيمتد في الناحيه الشرقيه من العاصمه واغلب قاطنيه من الفقراء المحرومين.\nاما بالنسبه الى التلوث البيئي، فيعاني كل من شرق ووسط عمّان من عده مصادر للتلوث، اهمها التلوث المائي المتمثل بسيل الزرقاء الذي يمر من منطقه سقف السيل في وسط البلد ومجاري تصريف المياه في ماركا، والتي يندر وجودها في احياء عمّان الغربيه.\n\nمعلومات عامه\nامناء ورؤساء عمّان\nابتداء منذ تاسيس اول مجلس بلدي للمدينه عام 1909 في

          "summary": "عَمَّان هي عاصمة المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية ومركز محافظة العاصمة. تُعد أكبر مدن المملكة وواحدة من أكبر المدن العربية بالنسبة لعدد السكان، إذ بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2023 حوالي 4.8 مليون نسمة، مما يجعلها أيضًا واحدة من أسرع المدن نموًا بالسكان بالعالم. تقع المدينة في وسط المملكة على دائرة عرض 31 شمالاً وخط طول 35 شرقًا في منطقة تكثر فيها الجبال، فنشأت في الوديان بين الجبال أولاً فضاقت على سكانها، فارتقوا سفوحها واستمروا في الاتساع عبر قممها حتى انتشرت المدينة بأطرافها فوق 20 جبلا.\nتُعتبر عمّان المركز التجاري والإداري للأردن وقلبه الاقتصادي والتعليمي، حيث أصبحت عمّان نقطة استقطاب للكثير من الجاليات العربية لموقعها المتميز ولعمارتها المعاصرة، كما تستقطب عمّان الكثير من السياح سنويًا من أوروبا الغربية وأمريكا الشمالية واليابان وإستراليا ومن الدول العربية المجاورة والقريبة، وكثيرًا من عائلات دول الخليج العربي تحديدًا، إذ تكثر بها المعالم السياحية عمومًا والعلاجية الطبية خصوصاً. كان من نتيجة وقوع عمّان في مثل هذا الموقع الاستراتيجي في بلاد الشام والشرق الأوسط، أن أصبح موقعها يتحكم بالاقتصاد الوطني ويُحرّك 90% من الاستثمار على المستوى الوطني.\nيرجع تاريخ مدينة عمّان إلى الألف السابع قبل الميلاد، وبهذا تُعتبر من ضمن أقدم مدن العالم المأهولة بالسكان إلى يومنا هذا. وعمّان مدينة قديمة أقيمت على أنقاض مدينة عرفت باسم «ربّة عمّون» ثم «فيلادلفيا» ثم «عمّان» اشتقاقاً من «ربة عمّون»، واتخذها العمّونيون عاصمة لهم. وقد أُنشئت المدينة على تلال سبعة، وكانت مركزًا للمنطقة على ما يبدو في ذلك الوقت، وهي إحدى عواصم بلاد الشام الأربع، وهي أيضًا إحدى المدن الشامية القديمة التي أصبحت عاصمةً لإمارة شرق الأردن ومن ثم المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية بعد استقلالها في العام 1946 عن بريطانيا.\nيسكن عمّان الحديثة مجموعة متنوعة من السكان من أصول مختلفة أتوا من مختلف المناطق، منهم من أتى من مدن أردنية قريبة، ومنهم من أتى من فلسطين، ومنهم من القوقاز وسوريا والعراق.\nشهدت أمانة عمان الكبرى مؤخرًا تطورًا كبيرًا، حيث توسعت عمان بشكل لم تشهده المدينة من قبل. ونالت خطة مدينة عمّان الشمولية جوائز عالمية منها جائزة القيادة العالمية في تخطيط المدن وجائزة المدينة عن قارة آسيا لعام 2007. يبلغ عدد المناطق الإدارية في أمانة عمان 22 منطقة مُوزعة جغرافيا تحوي كل منطقة طاقمًا متكاملا من الموظفين، أما من الناحية الإدارية فهناك مجلس أمانة عمان الكبرى الذي يضم 68 عضوا برئاسة أمين العاصمة، والمجلس مقسم بدوره إلى 14 لجنة مختلفة.\nيُشار بالذكر إلى أنه تم اعتماد يوم 2 آذار/ مارس من كل عام يومًا لمدينة عمّان بعد إقرار مجلس الوزراء الأردني قرارًا بذلك في بداية عام 2021، وذلك في إطار الاحتفاء بمرور 100 عام على تأسيس الدولة الأردنيّة.",

          "title": "Aqaba",
          "content": "Aqaba (English:   AK-ə-bə, US also  AHK-; Arabic: الْعَقَبَة, romanized: al-ʿAqaba, pronounced [ælˈʕæqɑba, ælˈʕæɡæba]) is the only coastal city in Jordan and the largest and most populous city on the Gulf of Aqaba. Situated in southernmost Jordan, Aqaba is the administrative center of the Aqaba Governorate. The city had a population of 148,398 in 2015 and a land area of 375 square kilometres (144.8 sq mi). Aqaba has significant trade and tourism. The Port of Aqaba also serves other countries in the region.\nAqaba's strategic location at the northeastern tip of the Red Sea between the continents of Asia and Africa has made its port important for thousands of years. The ancient city was called Elath, known in Latin as Aela) and in Arabic as Ayla. Its strategic location and proximity to copper mines made it a regional hub for copper production and trade in the Chalcolithic period.\nAela became a bishopric under Byzantine rule and later became a Latin Catholic titular see after Islamic conquest around AD 650, when it became known as Ayla; the name Aqaba is late medieval. In the Great Arab Revolt's Battle of Aqaba Arab forces defeated the Ottoman defenders.\nAqaba's location next to Wadi Rum and Petra has made it one of the major tourist attractions in Jordan. The city is administered by the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, which has turned Aqaba into a low-tax, duty-free city, attracting several mega projects like Ayla Oasis, Saraya Aqaba, Marsa Zayed and expansion of the Port of Aqaba. They are expected to turn the city into a major tourism hub in the region. However, industrial and commercial activities remain important, due to the strategic location of the city as the country's only seaport. The city sits right across the border from Eilat, likewise Israel's only port on the Red Sea. After the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, there were plans and hopes of establishing a trans-border tourism and economic area, but few of those plans have come to fruition.\n\nName\nIn antiquity, the name of the city was Elath or Ailath. The name is presumably derived from the Semitic name of a tree in the genus Pistacia. Modern Eilat (established 1947), situated about 5 km (3.1 mi) north-west of Aqaba, also takes its name from the ancient settlement. In the Hellenistic period, it was renamed Berenice (Ancient Greek: Βερενίκη Bereníkē), but the original name survived, and under Roman rule was re-introduced in the forms Aila, Aela or Haila, adopted in Byzantine Greek as Αἴλα Aíla and in Arabic as Ayla (آيلا). The crusaders called the city Elyn.\nThe present name comes from the identically-named Gulf of Aqaba, named that as early as 150 A.D. (or somewhat later, if added by a subsequent editor), as evidenced by the plotting of a Mt. Acabe ('Ακάβη όρος) in Ptolemy's Geography, which mountain is shown directly across from the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, on the western coast of the Red Sea, probably somewhere in the vicinity of modern Hurghada, Egypt, and ancient Mons Claudianus, both of which placenames could also themselves be derived cognate forms of the word Aqaba, the former by morphological drift, the latter as a translation into Latin, wherein \"Claudianus\" also suggests limping or stumbling, a perfect semantic overlap for the literal Arabic meaning of \"Aqaba\" (عقبة), as an \"obstacle,\" \"stumbling block,\" or \"spine.\"  Thus the Gulf of Aqaba may've in turn gotten its name from this older region, West of it, around Mt. Acabe (not necessarily a single identifiable mountain), construed as the rough spine of highland that must be crossed, to pass thru the natural trade corridor there, from the Upper Nile to the Red Sea, along modern Egyptian Highway 60.  \nThis name first became mentioned in connection with the city itself of Aqaba, in the 12th century, as ʿaqabat Aylah (عقبة آيلة, 'the mountain-pass of Ayla'), mentioned by Idrisi, at a time when the settlement had been mostly reduced to a military stronghold, properly referring to the pass just to the north-east of the settlement (29.559°N 35.095°E﻿ / 29.559; 35.095, now traversed by the Jordanian Aqaba Highway).\n\nHistory\nNearby Chalcolithic sites\nExcavations at two tells (archaeological mounds) Tall Hujayrat Al-Ghuzlan and Tall Al-Magass, both a few kilometres north of modern-day Aqaba city, revealed inhabited settlements from c. 4000 BC during the Chalcolithic period, with thriving copper production on a large scale. This period is largely unknown due to the absence of written historical sources. University of Jordan \narchaeologists have discovered the sites, where they found a small building whose walls were inscribed with human and animal drawings, suggesting that the building was used as a religious site. The people who inhabited the site had developed an extensive water system in irrigating their crops which were mostly made up of grapes, olives and wheat. Several different-sized clay pots were also found suggesting that copper production was a major industry in the region, the pots being used in melting the copper and reshaping it. Scientific studies performed on-site revealed that it had undergone two earthquakes, with the latter one leaving the site completely destroyed.\n\nEarly history\nElath\nThe Edomites, who ruled over Edom just south of the Dead Sea, are believed to have built the first port in Aqaba called Elath around 1500 BC, turning it into a major hub for the trade of copper as the Phoenicians helped them develop their maritime economy. They profited from its strategic location at the junction of trading routes between Asia and Africa.\n\nTell el-Kheleifeh\nArchaeologists have investigated an Iron Age settlement at Tell el-Kheleifeh, immediately west of Aqaba, inhabited between the 8th and 4th centuries BCE.\n\nUndefined\nAround 735 BC, the city was conquered by the Assyrian empire. Because of the wars the Assyrians were fighting in the east, their trading routes were diverted to the city and the port witnessed relative prosperity. The Babylonians conquered it in 600 BC. During this time, Elath witnessed great economic growth, which is attributed to the business background of its rulers who realized how important the city's location was. The Persian Achaemenid Empire took the city in 539 BC.\n\nClassical antiquity\nHellenistic period\nThe city continued to grow and prosper which made it a major trading hub by the time of the Greek rule by 300 BC, after the Wars of Alexander the Great, it was described by a Greek historian to be \"one of the most important trading cities in the Arab World\". The Ptolemaic Greeks called it Berenice.\nThe Nabatean kingdom had its capital north of the city, at Petra.\n\nRoman period\nIn 64 BC, following the Roman conquest, they annexed the city and called it Aela (also Haila, Aelana, in Greek rendered Αἴλα Aila).\nBoth Petra and Aela were under strong Nabatean influence despite the Roman rule. Aela reached its peak during Roman times, the great long-distance road the Via Traiana Nova led south from Bostra through Amman, terminating in Aela, where it connected with a west road leading to the Paralia and Roman Egypt.\nAround AD 106 Aela was one of the main ports for the Romans.\n\nLate Roman and Byzantine periods\nThe Aqaba Church was constructed under Roman rule between 293 and 303 and is considered to be the oldest known purpose-built Christian church in the world. By the time of Eusebius, Aela became the garrison of the Legio X Fretensis, which was moved to Aela from Jerusalem.\n\nOne of the oldest known texts written in the Arabic alphabet is a late 4th-century inscription found in Jabal Ram 50 kilometres (31 miles) east of Aqaba.\nThe city became a Christian bishopric at an early stage. Its bishop Peter was present at the First Council of Nicaea, the first ecumenical council, in 325. Beryllus was at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and Paul at the synod called by Patriarch Peter of Jerusalem in 536 against Patriarch Anthimus I of Alexandria, a council attended by bishops of the Late Roman provinces of Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda and Palaestina Tertia, to the last-named of which Aela belonged.\nA citadel was also built in the area that became the focal point of the Roman southern defense system.\nIn the 6th century, Procopius of Caesarea mentioned a Jewish population in Eilat and its surroundings which enjoyed autonomy until the time of Justinian I (r. 527–565).\nAccording to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad himself reached Aila during the expedition of Tabuk of 630, and extracted tribute from the city.\nDuring the Late Byzantine or even Early Muslim period, Aila was the origin of what came to be known as the Ayla-Axum amphoras.\n\nEarly Muslim Ayla\nAila fell to the Islamic armies by 629, and the ancient settlement was left to decay, while a new Arab city was established outside its walls under Uthman ibn Affan, known as Ayla (Arabic: آيلا).\nThe Early Muslim city was excavated in 1986 by a team from the University of Chicago. Artefacts are now on exhibit at Aqaba Archaeological Museum and Jordan Archaeological Museum in Amman. The fortified city was inscribed in a rectangle of 170 by 145 metres (558 ft × 476 ft), with walls 2.6 metres (8 ft 6 in) thick and 4.5 metres (14 ft 9 in) high, surrounding a fortified structure, occupying an area of 35 by 55 metres (115 ft × 180 ft). 24 towers defended the city. The city had four gates on all four sides, defining two main lines intersecting at the centre. The intersection of these two thoroughfares was indicated by a tetrapylon (a four-way arch), which was later transformed into a luxury residential building decorated with frescoes dated to the tenth century. This type of urban structure, known as a misr (pl. amsar), is typical of early Islamic fortified settlements.\n\nThe city prospered from 661 to 750 under the Umayyads and beyond under the Abbasids (750–970) and the Fatimids (970–1116). Ayla took advantage of its key position as an important step on the road to India and Arab spices (frankincense, myrrh), between the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian Peninsula. The city is also mentioned in several stories of the Arabian Nights.\nThe geographer Shams Eddin Muqaddasi describes Ayla as nearby the ruined ancient city.\nThe city was mentioned in Medieval Arabic sources as having a mixed population of Jews and Christians. It subsequently became an important station for pilgrim caravans on the way to Mecca.\nThe city was \"completely destroyed\" by the 1068 Near East earthquake.\n\nCrusader/Ayyubid and Mamluk periods\nBaldwin I of Jerusalem took over the city in 1115 without encountering much resistance. The centre of the city then moved to 500 meters along the coast to the south, and the crusader fortress of Elyn was built, which allowed the Kingdom of Jerusalem to dominate all roads between Damascus, Egypt, and Arabia, protecting the Crusader states from the east and allowing for profitable raids on trade caravans passing through the area. In order to secure this strategic position, Baldwin also built and garrisoned a fortress on Pharaoh's Island (called Île de Graye by the Franks), the modern Jazīrat Fir'aun in Egyptian territorial waters about 7 kilometres (4.3 miles) west of Aqaba.\nThe garrison of Elyn (now serving primarily as a military outpost) was further strengthened in 1142 by Pagan the Butler, Lord of Oultrejourdain, who pursued an ambitious program of castle building throughout his domain. However, there was no large-scale settlement of Europeans in the area, and the region between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba remained mainly inhabited by Bedouins, who were obliged to pay tribute to the Lordship of Oultrejourdain. Despite all efforts to fortify the region, the city was captured in 1170 by a squadron sent by Saladin as he was besieging Gaza; while it was successfully raided by Raynald of Châtillon in 1182, it was never retaken by the Crusaders.\nThe old fort was rebuilt, as Aqaba Fortress, by Mamluk sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh Al-Ghuri in the early 16th century. For the next four centuries, the site was a simple fishing village of little importance.\n\nModern history\nDuring World War I, the Ottoman forces were forced to withdraw from Aqaba in 1917 after the Battle of Aqaba, led by T. E. Lawrence and the Arab forces of Auda Abu Tayi and Sherif Nasir. The capture of Aqaba allowed the British to supply the Arab forces. In 1918, the regions of Aqaba and Ma'an were officially incorporated into the Kingdom of the Hejaz. In 1925, Ibn Saud the ruler of Nejd with the help of his Wahhabi Ikhwan troops successfully annexed the Hejaz, but gave up the Ma'an and Aqaba to the British protectorate of Transjordan.\n\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 8,908 inhabitants in 'Aqaba.\nIn 1965, King Hussein, through an exchange deal with Saudi Arabia, gave 6,000 square kilometres (2,317 square miles) of desert land in Jordanian territories in exchange for other territories, including 12 kilometres (7 miles) of an extension of prime coastline south of Aqaba, which included the Yamanieh coral reef. Aqaba was a major site for imports of Iraqi goods in the 1980s until the Persian Gulf War.\nIn 1997, the Aqaba Marine Reserve was established within the southern boundaries of the Gulf of Aqaba.\n\nGeography\nThe city lies at Jordan's southernmost point, on the Gulf of Aqaba lying at the tip of the Red Sea. Its strategic location is shown in the fact that it is located at the crossroads of the continents of Asia and Africa, while bordering Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\nClimate\nAqaba has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with mild, sometimes warm winters and very hot dry summers. Subzero temperatures can be observed every few years. The record high temperature of 49.6 °C (121.3 °F) was registered on 14 August 2025 . The record low temperature of −3.9 °C (25.0 °F) was on January 16, 2008, as in Eilat.\n\nLocal government\nIn August 2000, the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA) was established which acted as the statutory institution empowered with administrative, fiscal, regulatory and economic responsibilities.\n\nAdministrative divisions\nJordan is divided into 12 administrative divisions, each called a Governorate. Aqaba Governorate divides into 3 Districts, some of which are divided into Subdistricts and further divided into villages.\n\nEconomy\nWith status as Jordan's special economic zone, Aqaba's economy is based on the tourism and port industry sectors.\nAqaba's location next to Wadi Rum and Petra has strengthened the city's location on the world map and made it one of the major tourist attractions in Jordan. The city is administered by the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, which has turned Aqaba into a low-tax, duty-free city, attracting several mega projects like Ayla Oasis, Saraya Aqaba, Marsa Zayed and expansion of the Port of Aqaba. They are expected to turn the city into a major tourism hub in the region. Industrial and commercial activities remain important, due to the strategic location of the city as the country's only seaport.\nAqaba is the only seaport of Jordan so virtually all of Jordan's exports depart from here. Heavy machinery industry is also flourishing in the city with regional assembly plants being located in Aqaba such as the Land Rover Aqaba Assembly Plant. \nBy 2008 the ASEZ had attracted $18bn in committed investments, beating its $6bn target by 2020 by a third and more in less than a decade. The goal was adjusted to bring in another $12bn by 2020, but in 2009 alone, deals worth $14bn were inked. Some projects currently under construction are:\n\nMarsa Zayed a $10 billion is the largest mega mixed-use development project ever envisioned in both Jordan and the region. Marsa Zayed will host facilities including residential neighborhoods, commercial outlets and amenities, entertainment venues, financial and business facilities, and a number of hotels. Additionally, the property will feature marinas and a cruise ship terminal. Marsa Zayed will encompass 6.4 million square meters of built-up property.\nSaraya Aqaba, a $1.5 billion resort with a man made lagoon, luxury hotels, villas, and townhouses that will be completed by 2017.\nAyla Oasis, a $1.5 billion resort around a man made lagoon with hotels, villas, an 18-hole golf course designed by Greg Norman.  It also has an Arabian Venice theme with apartment buildings built along canals only accessible by walkway or boat. This project will be completed by 2017.\nTala Bay, Tala Bay was developed in a distinctive architectural style that blends Jordanian and regional architecture with total cost of US$680 million.  Another distinguishing feature of this single community resort is its two-kilometer private sandy beach on the Red Sea.\nThe Red Sea Astrarium (TRSA), the world's only Star Trek themed park, worth $1.5 billion would have been completed by 2014 but cancelled in 2015.\nPort relocation. Aqaba's current port will be relocated to the southernmost part of the province near the Saudi border. Its capacity will surpass that of the current port.  The project costs $5 billion, and it will be completed by 2013.\nAqaba will be connected by the national rail system which will be completed by 2013.  The rail project will connect Aqaba with all Jordan's main cities and economic centers and several countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Syria.\nThe Aqaba Container Terminal (ACT) handled a record 587,530 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in 2008, an increase of 41.6% on the previous year. To accommodate the rise in trade on the back of the increasing popularity of container shipping and the stabilising political situation in Iraq, the Aqaba Development Corporation (ADC) has announced plans for a new port. The port relocation 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the south will cost an estimated $600m and will improve infrastructure, while freeing up space for development in the city. Plans for upgrading the King Hussein International Airport (KHIA) and the development of a logistics centre will also help position Aqaba as a regional hub for trade and transport.\n\nTourism\nAqaba has a number of luxury hotels, including in the Tala Bay resort 20 kilometres (12 miles) further to the south, which service those who come for fun on the beaches as well as Scuba diving. Aqaba offers more than thirty primary diving locations, with the majority of them accommodating divers of all skill levels. These diving sites comprise fringing reefs that extend for over 25 kilometres (16 miles), reaching all the way to the border with Saudi Arabia.\nIt also offers activities which take advantage of its desert location.  Its many coffee shops offer mansaf and knafeh, and baqlawa desserts. Another very popular venue is the Turkish Bath (Hamam) built in 306 AD, in which locals and visitors alike come to relax after a hot day.\n\nIn 2006, the Tourism Division of the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA) reported that the number of tourists visiting the Zone in 2006 rose to about 432,000, an increase of 5% over previous year. Approximately 65%, or 293,000 were Jordanians. Of foreign tourists, Europeans visited the Zone in the largest numbers, with about 98,000 visiting during the year. The division has financed tourism advertising and media campaigns with the assistance of the European Union.\nAqaba has been chosen for the site of a new waterfront building project that would rebuild Aqaba with new man-made water structures, new high-rise residential and office buildings, and more tourist services to place Aqaba on the investment map and challenge other centers of waterfront development throughout the region.\nAqaba was chosen as the Arab Tourism City of 2011.\nDuring the 5-day holiday at both the end of Ramadan and Eid Al-Adha, Jordanian and western expats flock into the city with numbers reaching up to 50,000 visitors. During this time the occupancy rate of most hotels there reaches as high as 90%, and are often fully booked.\nThe several development projects (i.e. Ayla, Saraya etc.) now taking place in Aqaba provide \"opportunities of empowerment\" for local populations that want to expand their agency within the city. According to Fulbright scholar Kimberly Cavanagh development projects will help exhibit the ways global- local partnerships and the resultant cultural exchanges,  can result in mutually beneficial outcomes.\n\nDemographics\nThe city of Aqaba has one of the highest population growth rates in Jordan in 2011, and only 44% of the buildings in the city had been built before 1990. A special census for Aqaba city was carried by the Jordanian department of statistics in 2007, the total population of Aqaba by the census of 2007 was 98,400.  The 2011 population estimate is 136,200. The results of the census compared to the national level are indicated as follows:\n\nReligion\nِIslam represents the majority of the population of Aqaba, but Christianity still exists today. Approximately 5,000 Christian families live in the city. There are several churches in the city and multiple Christian schools including Rosary Sisters School Aqaba.\n\nCityscape\nResidential buildings in Aqaba are made up of 4 stories, of which are covered with sandstone or limestone. The city has no high-rises; however, Marsa Zayed project is planned to dramatically change that reality through the construction of several high-rise towers that host hotels, residential units, offices and clinics.\n\nCulture\nMuseums\nThe largest museum in Aqaba is the Aqaba Archaeological Museum.\n\nLifestyle\nAqaba has recently experienced a great growth in its nightlife, especially during the dramatic increase of tourist number in the 2000s.\n\nTransport\nRail\nThe Aqaba railway which transported phosphate to the old port ceased operations in 2018. A successor line to transport phosphate from Al Shidiya and Ghor es-Safi to the new terminal in Port of Aqaba is planned through an agreement between Jordan's Ministry for Transport and Etihad Rail.\nThere has been propositions to connect Eilat to Aqaba by rail.\n\nAirports\nKing Hussein International Airport is the only civilian airport outside of Amman in the country, located to the north of Aqaba. It is a 20-minutes drive away from the city center. Regular flights are scheduled from Amman to Aqaba with an average flying time of 45 minutes which is serviced by Royal Jordanian Airlines and Jordan Aviation Airlines. Several international airlines connect the city to Istanbul, Dubai, Alexandria, Sharm el-Sheikh, and other destinations in Asia and Europe. Since the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, there were plans to jointly develop airport infrastructure in the region. However, when Israel built Ramon Airport only 10 km distant from King Hussein International Airport, this happened without consulting the Jordanian side, which caused a slight deterioration of bilateral relations between the two countries and concerns over the safety of having two airports so close together.\n\nRoads\nAqaba is connected by an 8,000 kilometres (5,000 mi) modern highway system to surrounding countries. The city is connected to the rest of Jordan by the Desert Highway and the King's Highway that provides access to the resorts and settlements on the Dead Sea. Aqaba is connected to Eilat in Israel by taxi and bus services passing through the Wadi Araba crossing. And to Haql in Saudi Arabia by the Durra Border Crossing. There are many bus services between Aqaba and Amman and the other major cities in Jordan, JETT and Trust International are the most common lines. These tourist buses are spacious and installed with air conditioning and bathrooms.\n\nPort\nThe Port of Aqaba is the only port in Jordan. Regular ferry routes to Taba are available on a daily basis and are operated by several companies such as Sindbad for Marine Transportation and Arab Bridge Maritime. The routes serve mainly the Egyptian coastal cities on the gulf like Taba and Sharm Al Sheikh. In 2006, the port was ranked as being the \"Best Container Terminal\" in the Middle East by Lloyd's List. The port was chosen for its recent improvements and its ability to handle local traffic as well as international traffic to four neighboring countries.\n\nWildlife\nThe Gulf of Aqaba is rich with marine life. The gulf is home to approximately 500 fish species, with many being permanent residents, like lion fish and octopus, while others are migratory, typically appearing during the summer, such as sailfish, considered the fastest fish in the ocean, as well as the world's largest fish, the whale shark. Marine mammals and reptiles also inhabit the gulf during summer, hawksbill sea turtles, and bottle nosed dolphins call Aqaba's gulf home as well. A large number of predatory shark species used to inhabit Aqaba's gulf but, due to overfishing and pollution, this population is in decline.  While mostly deep water sharks such as the tiger sharks and thresher sharks are present, there are also a small number of reef sharks as well. The world's fastest shark, the short-fin mako shark is the most commonly caught species by fishermen in Aqaba. Whale sharks, locally known as Battan,  are the most commonly sighted. Conservationists are working hard to protect Aqaba's shark population.\nThe gulf of Aqaba hosts more than 390 bird species including migratory birds such as the greater flamingo, great white pelican and the pink-backed pelican.\n\nEducation\nThere is a University of Jordan Aqaba Branch.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nAqaba is twinned with:\n\nGallery\nSee also\nAqaba Special Economic Zone Authority\nDisi Water Conveyance Project\nMidian\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nAqaba Marketing and Tourism Directorate\nPhotos of Aqaba at the American Center of Research\nPhotos of Aqaba / Ayla at the American Center of Research\nAqaba - the Jewel of the Red Sea",
          "summary": "Aqaba (English:   AK-ə-bə, US also  AHK-; Arabic: الْعَقَبَة, romanized: al-ʿAqaba, pronounced [ælˈʕæqɑba, ælˈʕæɡæba]) is the only coastal city in Jordan and the largest and most populous city on the Gulf of Aqaba. Situated in southernmost Jordan, Aqaba is the administrative center of the Aqaba Governorate. The city had a population of 148,398 in 2015 and a land area of 375 square kilometres (144.8 sq mi). Aqaba has significant trade and tourism. The Port of Aqaba also serves other countries in the region.\nAqaba's strategic location at the northeastern tip of the Red Sea between the continents of Asia and Africa has made its port important for thousands of years. The ancient city was called Elath, known in Latin as Aela) and in Arabic as Ayla. Its strategic location and proximity to copper mines made it a regional hub for copper production and trade in the Chalcolithic period.\nAela became a bishopric under Byzantine rule and later became a Latin Catholic titular see after Islamic conquest around AD 650, when it became known as Ayla; the name Aqaba is late medieval. In the Great Arab Revolt's Battle of Aqaba Arab forces defeated the Ottoman defenders.\nAqaba's location next to Wadi Rum and Petra has made it one of the major tourist attractions in Jordan. The city is administered by the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, which has turned Aqaba into a low-tax, duty-free city, attracting several mega projects like Ayla Oasis, Saraya Aqaba, Marsa Zayed and expansion of the Port of Aqaba. They are expected to turn the city into a major tourism hub in the region. However, industrial and commercial activities remain important, due to the strategic location of the city as the country's only seaport. The city sits right across the border from Eilat, likewise Israel's only port on the Red Sea. After the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, there were plans and hopes of establishing a trans-border tourism and economic area, but few of those plans have come to fruition.",

          "content": "العقبه هي المدينه الساحليه الوحيده في الاردن، والمدينه الاكبر والاكثر سكانا بين مدن خليج العقبه جميعها. تقع العقبه في اقصى جنوب المملكه الاردنيّه الهاشميّه على ساحل البحر الاحمر، وهي مركز محافظه العقبه. تبعد المدينه حوالي 330 كيلومتر جنوب العاصمه الاردنيه عمّان. وقد بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2015 حوالي 148,398 نسمه، حيث تُعد خامس اكبر مدينه في المملكه. وتبلغ مساحه المدينه 375 كيلومتر مربع (144.8 ميل2). وللعقبه دور كبير في الاقتصاد الوطني الاردني وتطويره؛ وذلك من خلال كل من القطاعين التجاري والسياحي. ويُذكر ان ميناء العقبه يعد معبرا بحريا مهما للدول الاخرى المجاوره للاردن كذلك.\nبسبب موقعها الاستراتيجي في اعلى شمال شرقي خليج العقبه المتفرع من البحر الاحمر، والذي يتوسط الطرق التجاريه بين قارتي اسيا وافريقيا؛ كل ذلك جعل من العقبه ومنفذها البحري منطقه مهمه عبر الاف السنين. بالاضافه لذلك، تتميز مدينه العقبه بانها منطقه استراتيجيه والمنفذ البحري الوحيد للاردن، كما انَّ للعقبه حدود بريه مع مدينه حقل في المملكه العربيه السعوديه عبر مركز حدود الدره، وحدود بحريه مع مصر وايضا مع مدينه ايلات عبر معبر وادي عربه وكلتا المدينتين تقعا على راس خليج العقبه المتفرع من البحر الاحمر. وتشتهر العقبه بكونها منطقه جاذبه لهواه الغوص بشواطئها المطله على البحر الاحمر. وتضم المدينه العديد من المنشات الصناعيه الهامه، والمناطق التجاريه الحره، ومطار الملك حسين الدولي. وتعتبر مركزا ادارياً مهماً في منطقه اقصى جنوب الاردن. ومصدر للفوسفات وبعض انواع الصدف. ويقدر عدد سكان المدينه بحوالي 150,000 نسمه.\nالاسم القديم للمدينه بحسب التوراه العبريه كان ايلات، وهو الاسم الذي استمر في الحقب اللاحقه الرومانيه وفي عهود الخلافه الاسلاميه على شكل ايله، ثم ايله. وبسبب موقعها موقعها الاستراتيجي وقربها من مناجم النحاس، فقد كانت مركزًا اقليميًا لانتاج النحاس وتجارته خلال العصر النحاسي. خلال الاحتلال البزنطي للمنطقه، اصبحت العقبه -ايله انذاك - ابرشيه نصرانيه، لتتحول بعد ذلك خلال الحكم العربي الاسلامي لابرشيه فخريه، وذلك عندما صار اسم المدينه ايله. اما اسم العقبه الحالي فهو ظهر في العهود المتاخره من القرون الوسطى. وخلال الثوره العربيه الكبرى، وقعت في العقبه معركه عرفت تاريخيا باسم معركه العقبه والتي كان لانتصار العرب فيها على الاتراك الاثر الحاسم في جلاء الاتراك عن البلاد العربيه.\nموقع مدينه العقبه بالقرب من وادي رم ومدينه البتراء احدى عجائب الدنيا السبع، جعل منها ومن المواقع المذكور ما يعرف بمثلث الاردن السياحي الذهبي؛ الشيء الذي قوّى من مكانتها السياحيه على الخريطه العالميه، كما جعلها واحده من كبريات الوجهات السياحيه الجاذبه في الاردن. تُدار العقبه اقتصاديا وخدماتيا من خلال سلطه منطقه العقبه الاقتصاديه الخاصه، والتي ساهمت بتحويل مدينه العقبه الى مدينه منخفضه الضرائب وخاليه من الرسوم الجمركيه، مما جعلها نقطه جاذبه لكبريات المشاريع مثل منتجعات ايله وسرايا العقبه ومرسى زايد  و هناك ايضاً رفاهيات مثل مهرجان العقبه و فعاليات رياضيه مثل سباقات القوارب وغيرها وايضاً  توسعه ميناء العقبه. كل تلك المشاريع من المتوقع منها ان تحول العقبه الى نقطه جذب سياحيه كبرى على مستوى الاقليم. ومع ذلك، تبقى للانشطه التجاريه والصناعيه اهميتها الكبيره؛ وذلك بسبب موقع العقبه وطبيعتها الاستراتيجيه، كونها هي المنفذ البحري الوحيد للاردن على العالم.\n\nالتسميه\nقبل اسم العقبه كان يطلق عليها اسم ايله وتعني في اللغه:\n\nاما اسم العقبه فبرز في العصر المملوكي، حيث كانت المدينه تذكر بايله او عقبه ايله ردحاً طويلاً من الزمن، حتى غلب اسم العقبه عليها في العصر المملوكي.\n\nتاريخ\nمنذ 4000 سنه قبل الميلاد كانت العقبه موطنا للعديد من الشعوب بسبب موقعها الاستراتيجي على البحر وعلى تقاطع الطرق بين اسيا وافريقيا واوروبا. كانت احد اهم مدن النبطيين الذين توسعوا في المنطقه واستوطنوها. وكانت معبراً لطرق التجاره الدوليه، تمر منها وتعود من خلالها القوافل القادمه من الحجاز وجنوب الجزيره العربيه متجهين الى مصر او بلاد الشام.\nاطلق اليونانيون عليها اسم بيرنايس واطلق عليها الرومان مسمى ايلا او الينا. خلال العهد الروماني كان طريق فيانوفاتريانا يتجه جنوباً من دمشق مارا بعمّان وينتهي في العقبه ومن هناك تتصل بالطريق المتجه غرباً الى فلسطين ومصر.\nبعد عهد النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم اصبحت العقبه تحت الحكم الاسلامي ثم تنقلت ملكيتها بين العديد من السلالات الحاكمه مثل الامويون والعباسيون والفاطميون والمماليك.\nخلال القرن الثاني عشر الميلادي قام الصليبيون باحتلال المنطقه وبنوا فيها قلعه لا تزال محفوظه الى الان. وبالاضافه الى بناء القلعه قاموا بتحصين جزيره تتبع الان المياه الاقليميه المصريه وتبعد 7 كم عن العقبه وتسمى جزيره فرعون.\nفي عام 1170م استعاد صلاح الدين الايوبي مدينه العقبه وجزيره فرعون. ثم استولى عليها المماليك في عام 1250م وبنوا فيها حصنا في القرن الرابع عشر في عهد اخر حكامهم وهو قانصوه الغوري.\nمع بدايه القرن السادس عشر خضعت المنطقه لنفوذ العثمانيين وفي فتره حكمهم بدات تفقد العقبه اهميتها فصارت قريه صغيره تعيش على صيد الاسماك.وتكون العقبه اجمل مدن الاردن\nخلال الحرب العالميه الاولى اجبرت القوات العثمانيه على مغادره القريه على يد القوات العربيه بقياده الشريف الحسين بن علي سنه 1917 ضاما العقبه لمملكته في الحجاز الامر الذي ادى الى فتح الابواب لخطوط الدعم القادمه من مصر الى القوات البريطانيه والعربيه في الاردن وفلسطين.\nفي عام 1965م تم الاتفاق بين الاردن والسعوديه على ان تاخذ السعوديه 6000 كم من الاراضي الصحراويه الداخليه الاردنيه مقابل 12 كم على الساحل في المنطقه القريبه من العقبه.\n\nالتركيبه السكانيه\nقامت دائره الاحصاء الاردنيه في عام 2007، باجراء عمليه تعداد لسكان في مدينه العقبه، بالمقارنه مع الاردن على الصعيد المحلي. وكانت النتائج على النحو الاتي:\n\nالسياحه في العقبه\nتعتبر السياحه في مدينه العقبه نشطه لاسباب متنوعه وانها منطقه ساحليه تقع على البحر الاحمر، كما ان فيها اماكن جميله يمكن زيارتها، فان العقبه منطقه مليئه بالسياح الذين ياتون للتمتع بالبحر الرائع والجو الجميل فيها.\nوتشتمل العقبه على اهم المشاريع المهتمه في السياحه البيئيه في الاردن وهي محطه العقبه لمراقبه الطيور والتي تستقطب عشرات الالف وربما الملايين من الطيور المهاجره اثناء رحلتها بين اوروبا وافريقيا خلال موسمي الهجره في الخريف والربيع، ويتضمن مشروع محطه العقبه لمراقبه الطيور غابه للاشجار الكبيره وحدائق لاشجار واطنه في المنطقه بالاضافه لمسطحات مائيه كبيره تلعب جميعها بشكل متكامل على استقطاب انواع مختلفه من الطيور قد يكون بعضها نادر الوجود على مستوى العالم الامر الذي يدفع العديد من المهتمين بمراقبه الطيور وعلماء الطيور لزياره المنطقه وعمل التحاليل العلميه والابحاث الخاصه بعلم الطيور.\nوتعد العقبه بشكل خاص ومنطقه الاردن بشكل عام من المناطق المهمه عالميا لهجره الطيور بناء على تصنيف Birdlife International.\n\nوتحتضن محطه العلوم البحريه الواقعه على الشاطئ الجنوبي لخليج العقبه معرضا للاحياء البحريه يستطيع الزائر ان يشاهد فيه الانواع المختلفه من المرجان والاسماك وغيرها من الكائنات الحيه المستوطنه في خليج العقبه. قامت هيئه تنشيط السياحه بعمل اعلانات وحملات دعائيه، بمساعده من الاتحاد الاوروبي.\nخلال فتره الاعياد الوطنيه ياتي الاردنيون من شمال المملكه، ولا سيما من عمان واربد، الى المنتجعات والشواطئ الرمليه، لقضاء عطله نهايه الاسبوع وخلال هذه الفتره تصل نسبه الاشغال في الفنادق الى 100%. في 2011 اختيرت العقبه عاصمه للسياحه العربيه.\nكما يوجد في مُحافظه العَقَبه وادي رم ذو الطّبيعه الرمليّه والجبليّه السّاحره. وفي جنوب العَقَبه اعلى ارتفاع في الاردن على الاطلاق مُتمثّلا بجبل ام الداميّ.\nتم افتتاح عام 2019 اول متحف عسكري مائي للغواصين في الاردن \nسيتم في عام 2020 الانتهاء من مشروع تطوير وتاهيل ساريه العلم الموجوده في ساحه الثوره العربيه الكبرى وستعتبر وجهه سياحيه تتضمن خمس متاحف واهم ما يميزها احتوائها على بيت الشريف حسين\n\nالاقتصاد\nاهتمت الاردن بالعقبه منذ التسعينات، لانها الميناء الاردني الوحيد. سعى الاردن لتطوير العقبه باكثر من صيغه، انتهت الى اعطاء منطقه العقبه وضعا خاصا، مثل الحوافز، والاعفاء من الضرائب، والرسوم، والاستقلال الاداري عن عمان، كما تم وضع الخطط لاجتذاب الاستثمار الاجنبي. اقتصاد العقبه نما بسرعه كبيره جدا بسبب انشاء منطقه العقبه الاقتصاديه الخاصه. وهناك تطور في العمران (الاسكان) وتشييد منتجعات جيده، ومشاريع جديده مثل خليج تالا بي وسرايا العقبه التي ستكون مكان لامضاء العطل والاجازات في منازل سكنيه متطوره للسياح والمواطنين على حد سواء. وتم استثمار اكثر من عشرين مليار دولار في العقبه منذ العام 2001 عندما تم تاسيس المنطقه الاقتصاديه الخاصه. وجذبت العقبه ايضا شركات لوجستيه عالميه مثل ايه بي ام تيرمينالز واجيليتي للاستثمار في مجال الخدمات اللوجستيه، مما عزز من وضع المدينه كمركز للنقل والخدمات اللوجستيه.\nتوجد العديد من الفنادق في العقبه ولكن هناك ايضا فنادق جديده قيد الانشاء. العقبه هي الميناء البحري الوحيد للاردن لذلك تقريبا اغلب صادرات الاردن تغادر من هذه المدينه. اكثر من 20 مليار دولار من الاستثمارات تتدفق الى العقبه من منطقه الخليج ومستثمريين اوروبيين، مما يجعل العقبه تتفوق على ايلات سياحيا واستثماريا، ايلات تلك المدينه المزدهره التي تقع على بعد بضع كيلومترات فقط.\nبحلول عام 2008 كانت منطقه العقبه الاقتصاديه الخاصه جذبت 18 مليار دولار من الاستثمارات، وبهذا تكون المدينه ضربت الرقم 6 مليارات دولار الذي طمحت ان تصل اليه بحلول عام 2020، بمقدار 300% واكثر من ذلك في اقل من عقد من الزمان. وقامت المدينه بتعديل هدفها الذي اصبح جلب 12 مليار دولار اخرى بحلول عام 2020، لكن في عام 2009 وحده وقّعت المدينه على صفقات بقيمه 14 مليار دولار. بعض المشاريع قيد الانشاء حاليا وهي على النحو الاتي:\n\nسرايا العقبه: 1.5 مليار دولار لبناء منتجع يضم بحيره صناعيه، فنادق فخمه، فلل، ومنازل فخمه على ان يكتمل المشروع بحلول عام 2017.\nمنتجع واحه ايلا بقيمه 2.1 مليار دولار وبحيره صناعيه المنتجع مع فنادق فخمه، فلل، ت وملعب للجولف ذي 18 حفره. ويحمل المنتجع طابعٌ يمثلُ بندقيهً عربيه، بطريقه تصميم المباني التي بنيت على طول قنوات مائيه لا يمكن الوصول اليها الا عن طريق قوارب او مسارات خاصه. الى جانب حديقه مائيه جزء من مشروع واحه ايلا' الذي سوف يكتمل بحلول عام 2017.\nخليج تالا بي عباره عن مجتمع منتقى ومتكامل، يقوم على مساحه مسيجه تبلغ 2.7 مليون متراً مربعا، يقع على الطرف الشمالي لخليج العقبه. وهذا المشروع اكتمل بقيمته 680 مليون دولار. كما يضم خليج تالا بي منتجعات وفنادق 4 او 5 مثل فندق الهيلتون.\nمرسى زايد، اكبر مشروع عقاري وسياحي على مستوى المنطقه، يمتد على مساحه 3.2 كم مربع ويشمل واجهه مائيه بطول 2 كم. ويهدف مشروع مرسى زايد الى تطوير الواجهه البحريه وتحويلها الى بيئه مؤهله للاستخدام المتعدد الاغراض تنتشر عليها الابراج السكنيه المرتفعه والمناطق المخصصه للمرافق الترفيهيه والسياحيه واخرى مخصصه للاعمال التجاريه والفنادق العالميه، على اكثر من ثلاثه ملايين متر مربع من الاراضي. ومن جهه اخرى، ستعد مراسي اليخوت المتعدده التي سيتم انشاؤها اضافه هامه للطاقه الاستيعابيه للمراسي القائمه حالياً في مدينه العقبه، مما يسهم في تحويل مدينه العقبه الى وجهه رئيسيه لليخوت، بالاضافه لانشاء ميناء حديث للبواخر السياحيه معد وفق افضل ما توصلت اليه التقنيات الحديثه في هذا المجال ليمثل بوابه للترحيب بزوار العقبه. سيتم تنفيذ هذا المشروع على عده مراحل على مدار 30 عاما، ومن المقرر ان يكتمل المشروع بحلول عام 2017.\nنقل الميناء سوف سيتم نقل ميناء العقبه الى الجزء الجنوبي من المحافظه بالقرب من الحدود السعوديه، بحلول عام 2016 حسب ما هو مقرر. وتطوير الميناء ليكون مرفا متطورا يضاهي المرافئ العالميه.\nسيتم ربط العقبه بمشروع شبكه السكك الوطنيه، الذي سيتم الانتهاء منه بحلول عام 2013. وسوف يربط مشروع السكك الحديديه في العقبه مع جميع المدن الرئيسيه في الاردن والمراكز الاقتصاديه والعديد من الدول مثل المملكه العربيه السعوديه والعراق وسوريا.\n\nمنطقه العقبه الاقتصاديه الخاصه\nاطلقت منطقه العقبه الاقتصاديه الخاصه (ASEZ) في عام 2001 بوصفها معفاه من الرسوم الجمركيه، منطقه تنمويه متعدده القطاعات بضرائب مخفضه تضم كامل منطقه الساحل الاردني (27 كم)، الموانئ البحريه

          "summary": "العقبة هي المدينة الساحلية الوحيدة في الأردن، والمدينة الأكبر والأكثر سكانا بين مدن خليج العقبة جميعها. تقع العقبة في أقصى جنوب المملكة الأردنيّة الهاشميّة على ساحل البحر الأحمر، وهي مركز محافظة العقبة. تبعد المدينة حوالي 330 كيلومتر جنوب العاصمة الأردنية عمّان. وقد بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2015 حوالي 148,398 نسمة، حيث تُعد خامس أكبر مدينة في المملكة. وتبلغ مساحة المدينة 375 كيلومتر مربع (144.8 ميل2). وللعقبة دور كبير في الاقتصاد الوطني الأردني وتطويره؛ وذلك من خلال كل من القطاعين التجاري والسياحي. ويُذكر أن ميناء العقبة يعد معبرا بحريا مهما للدول الأخرى المجاورة للأردن كذلك.\nبسبب موقعها الاستراتيجي في أعلى شمال شرقي خليج العقبة المتفرع من البحر الأحمر، والذي يتوسط الطرق التجارية بين قارتي آسيا وإفريقيا؛ كل ذلك جعل من العقبة ومنفذها البحري منطقة مهمة عبر آلاف السنين. بالإضافة لذلك، تتميز مدينة العقبة بأنها منطقة إستراتيجية والمنفذ البحري الوحيد للأردن، كما أنَّ للعقبة حدود برية مع مدينة حقل في المملكة العربية السعودية عبر مركز حدود الدرة، وحدود بحرية مع مصر وأيضا مع مدينة إيلات عبر معبر وادي عربة وكلتا المدينتين تقعا على رأس خليج العقبة المتفرع من البحر الأحمر. وتشتهر العقبة بكونها منطقة جاذبة لهواة الغوص بشواطئها المطلة على البحر الأحمر. وتضم المدينة العديد من المنشآت الصناعية الهامة، والمناطق التجارية الحرة، ومطار الملك حسين الدولي. وتعتبر مركزا إدارياً مهماً في منطقة أقصى جنوب الأردن. ومصدر للفوسفات وبعض أنواع الصدف. ويقدر عدد سكان المدينة بحوالي 150,000 نسمة.\nالاسم القديم للمدينة بحسب التوراة العبرية كان إيلات، وهو الاسم الذي استمر في الحقب اللاحقة الرومانية وفي عهود الخلافة الإسلامية على شكل أيلة، ثم آيلة. وبسبب موقعها موقعها الاستراتيجي وقربها من مناجم النحاس، فقد كانت مركزًا إقليميًا لإنتاج النحاس وتجارته خلال العصر النحاسي. خلال الاحتلال البزنطي للمنطقة، أصبحت العقبة -أيلة آنذاك - أبرشية نصرانية، لتتحول بعد ذلك خلال الحكم العربي الإسلامي لأبرشية فخرية، وذلك عندما صار اسم المدينة آيلة. أما اسم العقبة الحالي فهو ظهر في العهود المتأخرة من القرون الوسطى. وخلال الثورة العربية الكبرى، وقعت في العقبة معركة عرفت تاريخيا باسم معركة العقبة والتي كان لانتصار العرب فيها على الأتراك الأثر الحاسم في جلاء الأتراك عن البلاد العربية.\nموقع مدينة العقبة بالقرب من وادي رم ومدينة البتراء إحدى عجائب الدنيا السبع، جعل منها ومن المواقع المذكور ما يعرف بمثلث الأردن السياحي الذهبي؛ الشيء الذي قوّى من مكانتها السياحية على الخريطة العالمية، كما جعلها واحدة من كبريات الوجهات السياحية الجاذبة في الأردن. تُدار العقبة اقتصاديا وخدماتيا من خلال سلطة منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة، والتي ساهمت بتحويل مدينة العقبة إلى مدينة منخفضة الضرائب وخالية من الرسوم الجمركية، مما جعلها نقطة جاذبة لكبريات المشاريع مثل منتجعات آيلة وسرايا العقبة ومرسى زايد  و هناك ايضاً رفاهيات مثل مهرجان العقبة و فعاليات رياضية مثل سباقات القوارب وغيرها وايضاً  توسعة ميناء العقبة. كل تلك المشاريع من المتوقع منها أن تحول العقبة إلى نقطة جذب سياحية كبرى على مستوى الإقليم. ومع ذلك، تبقى للأنشطة التجارية والصناعية أهميتها الكبيرة؛ وذلك بسبب موقع العقبة وطبيعتها الاستراتيجية، كونها هي المنفذ البحري الوحيد للأردن على العالم.",

          "content": "Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء‎, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα, lit. 'Rock'), originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu (Nabataean Aramaic: 𐢛𐢚𐢒‎ or 𐢛𐢚𐢓𐢈‎, *Raqēmō), is an ancient city and archaeological site in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also called the \"Rose City\" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved. The city is one of the New 7 Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and was settled by the Nabataeans, a nomadic Arab people, in the 4th century BC. Petra would later become the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom in the second century BC. The Nabataeans invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub, which gained them considerable revenue. Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and thus were able to defend their kingdom. They were particularly skillful in agriculture, stone carving, and rainwater harvesting.\nPetra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants. Nabataea fell to the Romans in 106 AD, who annexed and renamed it Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.\nUNESCO has described Petra as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\". Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Visitor numbers reach close to a million tourists every year.\n\nHistory\nNeolithic\nBy 7000 BC, some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in Beidha, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement just north of Petra.\n\nBronze Age\nPetra is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and the Amarna letters as Pel, Sela, or Seir.\n\nIron Age Edom\nThe Iron Age lasted between 1200 and 600 BC; in that time, the Petra area was occupied by the Edomites. The configuration of mountains in Petra allowed for a reservoir of water for the Edomites. This made Petra a stopping point for merchants, making it an outstanding area for trade. Some wares that were traded included wines, olive oil, and wood.\nInitially, the Edomites were accompanied by Nomads who eventually left, but the Edomites stayed and made their mark on Petra before the emergence of the Nabataens. It is said that 10,000 men were thrown off of the mountain Umm el-Biyara, but this story has been debated by scholars.\nThe Edomite site excavated at the top of the Umm el-Biyara mountain at Petra was established no earlier than the seventh century BC (Iron II).\n\nEmergence of Petra\nThe Nabataeans were one among several nomadic Bedouin tribes that roamed the Arabian Desert and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water. Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, theories about them having Aramean roots are rejected by many modern scholars. Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern Arabian tribe. Current evidence suggests that the Nabataean name for Petra was Raqēmō, variously spelled in inscriptions as rqmw or rqm.\nThe Jewish historian Josephus (ca. 37–100 AD) writes that the region was inhabited by the Midianites during the time of Moses, and that they were ruled by five kings, one of whom was Rekem. Josephus mentions that the city, called Petra by the Greeks, \"ranks highest in the land of the Arabs\" and was still called Rekeme by all the Arabs of his time, after its royal founder (Antiquities iv. 7, 1; 4, 7). The Onomasticon of Eusebius also identified Rekem as Petra. Arabic raqama means \"to mark, to decorate\", so Rekeme could be a Nabataean word referring to the famous carved rock façades. In 1964, workmen clearing rubble away from the cliff at the entrance to the gorge found several funerary inscriptions in Nabatean script. One of them was to a certain Petraios who was born in Raqmu (Rekem) and buried in Garshu (Jerash).\n\nAn old theory held that Petra might be identified with a place called sela in the Hebrew Bible. Encyclopædia Britannica (1911) states that the Semitic name of the city, if not Sela, would remain unknown. It nevertheless cautioned that sela simply means \"rock\" in Hebrew, and thence might not be identified with a city where it occurs in the biblical text in the book of Obadiah. It is possible that the city was part of the nation of Edom.\nThe passage in Diodorus Siculus (xix. 94–97) described the Nabataeans at the time as a nomadic group of people who believed that those who owned possessions could be easily compelled by those who held power, this would drastically change as the centuries went on.\nThis text further describes the expeditions which Antigonus sent against the Nabataeans in 312 BC, was understood by some researchers to throw some light upon the history of Petra, but the \"petra\" (Greek for rock) referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper name, and the description implies that there was no town in existence there at the time.\n\nRoman period\nIn 106, when Aulus Cornelius Palma Frontonianus was governor of Roman Syria, the part of the Arabian Peninsula under the rule of Petra was absorbed into the Roman Empire as part of Arabia Petraea, and Petra became its capital. The native dynasty came to an end but the city continued to flourish under Roman rule. It was around this time that the Petra Roman Road was built. A century later, in the time of Severus Alexander, when the city was at the height of its splendor, the issue of coinage came to an end. There was no more building of sumptuous tombs, owing apparently to some sudden catastrophe, such as an invasion by the Sasanian Empire.\nMeanwhile, as Palmyra (fl. 130–270) grew in importance and attracted the pre-Islamic Arab trade away from Petra, the latter declined. It appears, however, to have lingered on as a religious center. Another Roman road was constructed at the site. Epiphanius of Salamis (c.315–403) writes that in his time a feast was held there on December 25 in honor of the virgin Khaabou and her offspring Dushara. Dushara and al-Uzza were two of the principal deities of the city, which otherwise included many idols from other Nabataean deities such as Allat and Manat.\nBetween 111 and 114, Trajan built the Via Traiana Nova, running from the Syrian border to the Red Sea through Petra. This road followed the old routes of Nabataean caravans. In the shadow of the Pax Romana, this route revived trade between Arabia, Syria, and Mediterranean harbors. In 125 AD, one of Emperor Hadrian's administrators left marks in Petra, pointed out by documents found at the Dead Sea. In 130, Hadrian visited the former Nabataean capital, giving it the name of Hadriānī Petra Metropolis, imprinted on his coins. His visit, however, did not lead to any boom in development and new buildings as it did in Jerash. The province's governor, Sextius Florentinus, erected a monumental mausoleum for his son near the end of the al-Hubta (King's Wall) tombs, which had been generally reserved during the Nabataean period for the royal family.\nRoman emperors' interest in the city in the 3rd century suggests that Petra and its environs remained highly esteemed for a long time. An inscription to Liber Pater, a god revered by Emperor Septimius Severus, was found in the temenos of the temple known as Qasr al-Bint, and Nabataean tombs contained silver coins with the emperor's portrait as well as pottery from his reign. Emperor Elagabalus declared Petra to be a Roman colony, when he reorganized the Roman Empire towards the end of the 3rd century. The area from Petra to Wadi Mujib, the Negev, and the Sinai Peninsula were annexed into the province of Palaestina Salutaris. The Madaba Map from the reign of Emperor Justinian I is missing the section that would include Petra.\n\nByzantine period\nPetra declined rapidly under Roman rule, in large part from the revision of sea-based trade routes. In 363, an earthquake destroyed many buildings and crippled the vital water management system. The old city of Petra was the capital of the Byzantine province of Palaestina III and many churches from the Byzantine period were excavated in and around Petra. In one of them, the Byzantine Church, 140 papyri were discovered, which contained mainly contracts dated from 530s to 590s, establishing that the city was still flourishing in the 6th century. The Byzantine Church is a prime example of monumental architecture in Byzantine Petra.\nThe last reference to Byzantine Petra comes from the Spiritual Meadow of John Moschus, written in the first decades of the 7th century. He gives an anecdote about its bishop, Athenogenes. It ceased to be a metropolitan bishopric sometime before 687 when that function had been transferred to Areopolis. Petra is not mentioned in the narratives of the Muslim conquest of the Levant, nor does it appear in any early Islamic records.\n\nCrusaders and Mamluks\nIn the 12th century, the Crusaders built fortresses such as the Alwaeira Castle, but were forced to abandon Petra after a while. As a result, the location of Petra was lost until the 19th century\nTwo further Crusader-period castles are known in and around Petra: the first is al-Wu'ayra, situated just north of Wadi Musa. It can be viewed from the road to Little Petra. It is the castle that was seized by a band of Turks with the help of local Muslims and only recovered by the Crusaders after they began to destroy the olive trees of Wadi Musa. The potential loss of livelihood led the locals to negotiate a surrender. The second is on the summit of el-Habis, in the heart of Petra, and can be accessed from the West side of the Qasr al-Bint.\nThe ruins of Petra were an object of curiosity during the Middle Ages and were visited by Baibars, one of the first Mamluk sultans of Egypt, towards the end of the 13th century.\n\n19th and 20th centuries\nThe first European to describe them was the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt during his travels in 1812. At that time, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem operated a diocese in al-Karak named Battra (Arabic: باطره, Ancient Greek: Πέτρας) and it was the opinion among the clergy of Jerusalem that Kerak was the ancient city of Petra.\nBurckhardt already spoke Arabic fluently, and was on his way to explore the Niger River when he heard stories of a dead city that held the tomb of the Prophet Aaron, and became fascinated with finding the city. He then dressed himself up as a local, and only spoke in Arabic, bringing a goat with him with the intent of sacrificing it in honor of Aaron's Tomb. After one day of exploring, he was convinced that he had found the lost city of Petra.\nLéon de Laborde and Louis-Maurice-Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds made the first accurate drawings of Petra in 1828. The Scottish painter David Roberts visited Petra in 1839 and returned to Britain with sketches and stories of the encounter with local tribes, published in The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia. Frederic Edwin Church, the leading American landscape painter of the 19th century, visited Petra in 1868, and the resulting painting El Khasné, Petra is among his most important and well-documented. Missionary Archibald Forder published photographs of Petra in the December 1909 issue of National Geographic.\n\nBecause the structures weakened with age, many of the tombs became vulnerable to thieves, and many treasures were stolen. In 1929, a four-person team consisting of British archaeologists Agnes Conway and George Horsfield, Palestinian physician and folklore expert Tawfiq Canaan and Ditlef Nielsen, a Danish scholar, excavated and surveyed Petra.\nThe archaeologist Philip Hammond from the University of Utah visited Petra for nearly 40 years. He explained that the local folklore says it was created by the wand of Moses, when he struck the rock to bring forth water for the Israelites. Hammond believed the carved channels deep within the walls and ground were made from ceramic pipes that once fed water for the city, from rock-cut systems on the canyon rim.\nIn the 1980s, the Bedul Bedouin, once inhabitants of Petra, were relocated by the Jordanian government to the nearby settlement of Umm Sayhoun, a process spanning two decades. This move was part of broader initiatives aimed at settling Bedouin communities and promoting tourism in Petra. With a name meaning \"the changing ones\" and oral traditions recounting a conversion narrative, the Bedul Bedouins are believed to have adopted Islam later in their history, possibly with Jewish or Nabatean origins. Today, alongside their traditional activities, they engage in local tourism, alongside the more prominent Liyathnah tribe.\nNumerous scrolls in Greek and dating to the Byzantine period were discovered in an excavated church near the Temple of the Winged Lions in Petra in December 1993.\n\n21st century\nIn December 2022, Petra was hit by heavy flooding.\n\nLayout\nPetra is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.\nExcavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificial oasis. The area is visited by flash floods, but archaeological evidence shows that the Nabataeans controlled these floods by the use of dams, cisterns, and water conduits. These innovations stored water for prolonged periods of drought and enabled the city to prosper from its sale.\nIn ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra, around Jabal Haroun (\"Aaron's Mountain\"), the location of the Tomb of Aaron, said to be the burial place of Aaron, brother of Moses. Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north. Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east. The impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge, in places only 3–4 m (10–13 ft) wide, called the Siq (\"shaft\"), a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the sandstone rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into Wadi Musa.\n\nHellenistic architecture\nPetra is known primarily for its Hellenistic architecture. The facades of the tombs in Petra are commonly rendered in Hellenistic style, reflecting the number of diverse cultures with which the Nabataeans traded, all of which were in turn influenced by Greek culture. Most of these tombs contain small burials niches carved into the stone.\nPerhaps the best example of the Hellenistic style is seen in the Treasury, which is 24 meters (79 ft) wide and 37 meters (121 ft) tall and refers to the architecture of Alexandria. The facade of the Treasury features a broken pediment with a central tholos inside, and two obelisks appear to form into the rock at the top. Near the bottom of the Treasury are the twin Greek gods Castor and Pollux, who protect travellers on their journeys. Near the top of the Treasury, two victories are seen standing on each side of a female figure on the tholos. This female figure is believed to be the Isis-Tyche, Isis and Tyche being the Egyptian and Greek goddesses, respectively, of good fortune.\nAnother prime example of Hellenistic architecture featured in Petra is its Monastery, which stands at 45 meters (148 ft) tall and 50 meters (160 ft) wide; this is Petra's largest monument and is similarly carved into the rock face. The facade of this again features a broken pediment, similar to the Treasury, as well as another central tholos. The Monastery displays more of a Nabataen touch while at the same time incorporating elements from Greek architecture. Its only source of light is its entrance standing at 8 meters (26 ft) high. There is a large space outside of the Monastery, which is purposefully flattened for worship purposes. Formerly, in the Byzantine period, this was a place for Christian worship, but is now a holy site for pilgrims to visit.\n\nCity centre\nAt the end of the narrow gorge, the Siq, stands Petra's most elaborate ruin, popularly known as Al-Khazneh (\"the Treasury\"), hewn into the sandstone cliff. While remaining in remarkably preserved condition, the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local Bedouin tribes that hoped to dislodge riches that were once rumoured to be hidden within it.\nA little farther from the Treasury, at the foot of the mountain called en-Nejr, is a massive theatre, positioned so as to bring the greatest number of tombs within view. At the point where the valley opens out into the plain, the site of the city is revealed with striking effect. The theatre was cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs during its construction. Rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible. Almost enclosing it on three sides are rose-coloured mountain walls, divided into groups by deep fissures and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers. The theatre  was said to hold around 8,500 people. The performances that audiences were able to attend here were poetry readings and dramas. Gladiator fights were also said to be held here and attracted the most audience, although no gladiator was able to gain any momentum or fame due to the heavy mortality rate that came with it. The theatre was one of many structures in Petra that took significant damage due to the 363 Galilee earthquake.\n\nThe Petra Pool and Garden Complex is a series of structures within the city center. Originally said to be a market area, excavations at the site have allowed scholars to identify it as an elaborate Nabataean garden, which included a large swimming pool, an island-pavilion, and an intricate hydraulic system.\nAhead of the Petra Pool and Garden Complex lies Colonnaded street, which is among few artifacts of Petra that was constructed rather than natural. This street used to hold a semi-circle nymphaeum, which is now in ruins due to flash flooding, and used to hold Petra's only tree. This was intended to be a symbol for the peaceful atmosphere that the Nabataens were able to construct in Petra. Once the Romans took control of the city, Colonnaded street was narrowed to make room for a side walk, and 72 columns were added to each side.\n\nHigh Place of Sacrifice\nThe High Place of Sacrifice is perched atop Jebel Madbah Mountain. The beginning of the hike is near Petra's theatre. From there, the site of The High Place of Sacrifice is around an 800-step hike. One commonly believed sacrifice that took place there was libation. Another common form of sacrifice that took place there was animal sacrifice; this is due to the belief that the tomb of the Prophet Aaron is located in Petra, which is a sacred site for Muslims. In honor of this, a goat was sacrificed annually. Other rituals also took place there, including the burning of frankincense.\n\nRoyal Tombs\nThe Royal Tombs of Petra are in the Nabatean version of Hellenistic architecture, but their facades have worn due to natural decay. One of these tombs, the Palace Tomb, is speculated to be the tomb for the kings of Petra. The Corinthian Tomb, which is right next to the Palace Tomb, has the same Hellenistic architecture featured on the Treasury. The two other Royal Tombs are the Silk Tomb and the Urn Tomb; the Silk Tomb does not stand out as much as the Urn Tomb. The Urn Tomb features a large yard in its front, and was turned into a church in 446 AD after the expansion of Christianity.\n\nExterior platform\nIn 2016, archaeologists using satellite imagery and drones discovered a very large, previously unknown monumental structure whose beginnings were tentatively dated to about 150 BC, the time when the Nabataeans initiated their public building programme. It is located outside the main area of the city, at the foot of Jabal an-Nmayr and about 0.5 mi (0.8 km) south of the city centre, but is facing east, not towards the city, and has no visible relationship to it. The structure consists of a huge, 184 by 161 ft (56 by 49 m) platform, with a monumental staircase along its eastern side. The large platform enclosed a slightly smaller one, topped with a comparatively small building, 28 by 28 ft (8.5 by 8.5 m), which was facing east toward the staircase. The structure, second in size only to the Monastery complex, probably had a ceremonial function of which not even a speculative explanation has yet been offered by the researchers.\n\nGeostrategic importance\nPliny the Elder and other writers identify Petra as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom and the centre of their caravan trade. Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a perennial stream, Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress, but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to Gaza in the west, to Bosra and Damascus in the north, to Aqaba and Leuce Come on the Red Sea, and across the desert to the Persian Gulf.\n\nReligious importance\nNabataean religion\nThe Nabataeans worshipped Arab gods and goddesses during the pre-Islamic era as well as a few of their deified kings. One, Obodas I, was deified after his death in 85 BC. Dushara was the primary male god accompanied by his three female deities: Al-‘Uzzā, Allat and Manāt. Many statues carved in the rock depict these gods and goddesses. New evidence indicates that broader Edomite, and Nabataean theology had strong links to Earth-Sun relationships, often manifested in the orientation of prominent Petra structures to equinox and solstice sunrises and sunsets.\n\nThe Monastery, Petra's largest monument, dates from the 1st century BC. It was dedicated to Obodas I and is believed to be the symposium of Obodas the god. This information is inscribed on the ruins of the Monastery (the name is the translation of the Arabic Ad Deir).\nThe Temple of the Winged Lions is a large temple complex dated to the reign of King Aretas IV (9 BC–40 AD). The temple is located in Petra's so-called Sacred Quarter, an area situated at the end of Petra's main Colonnaded Street consisting of two majestic temples, the Qasr al-Bint and, opposite, the Temple of the Winged Lions on the northern bank of Wadi Musa.\n\nLate Roman and Byzantine-period Christianity\nChristianity found its way to Petra during the 4th century AD, nearly 500 years after the establishment of Petra as a trade centre, and the city was gradually converted over the course of the 4th century and possibly into the early 5th century AD. The start of Christianity in Petra started primarily in 330 AD when the first Christian emperor of Rome took over, Constantine I, otherwise known as Constantine the Great. Together with Licinius, he issued a decree of tolerance which stopped the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire.  Athanasius mentions a bishop of Petra (Antioch. 10) named Asterius. At least one of the tombs (now known as the \"Urn Tomb\") was used as a church. An inscription in red paint records its consecration \"in the time of the most holy bishop Jason\" (447).\n\nEarly Muslim and Crusader periods\nAfter the  Muslim conquest of 629–632, Christianity in Petra, as of most of Arabia, gave way to Islam.\nIn the wake of the First Crusade, part of Transjordan including Petra was conquered by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem and formed the second fief of the barony of Krak (in the lordship of Oultrejordain) with the title Château de la Valée de Moyse or Sela. It remained in the hands of the Franks until 1189. It is still a titular see of the Catholic Church - see Archbishop of Petra and List of Catholic titular sees: Petra in Palaestina.\n\nTraditional connection to Moses, Aaron and Miriam\nAccording to a tradition, Petra is the spot where Moses (Musa in Arabic) struck a rock with his staff and water came forth, and where Moses' brother, Aaron (Harun in Arabic), is buried, at Mount Hor, known in Arabic as Jabal Haroun, 'Mount Aaron'. Placing the death of Aaron on a mountain peak near Petra dates back to at least the time of Josephus (see Antiquities IV. 4, 7). A memorial church built in the saddle under the peak in the 5th century became the nucleus of a monastery frequented by pilgrims, named in a document from among the Petra papyri and dated to 573 as \"the House of ... High Priest Aaron.\" Wadi Musa or the \"Wadi of Moses\" is the Arabic name for the narrow valley at the head of which Petra is sited.\nA mountaintop shrine of Moses' sister Miriam was still shown to pilgrims at the time of Jerome in the 4th century, but its location has not been identified since.\n\nClimate\nIn Petra, there is a semi-arid climate. Most rain falls in the winter. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification is BSk. The average annual temperature in Petra is 15.5 °C (59.9 °F). About 193 mm (7.60 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nConservation\nThe Bedul (Petra Bedouin) were forcibly resettled from their cave dwellings in Petra to Umm Sayhoun/Um Seihun by the Jordanian government in 1985, prior to the UNESCO designation process. They were provided with block-built housing with some infrastructure including in particular a sewage and drainage system. Among the six communities in the Petra Region, Umm Sayhoun is one of the smaller communities. The village of Wadi Musa is the largest in the area, inhabited largely by the Layathnah Bedouin, and is now the closest settlement to the visitor centre, the main entrance via the Siq and the archaeological site generally. Umm Sayhoun gives access to the 'back route' into the site, the Wadi Turkmaniyeh pedestrian route.\nOn December 6, 1985, Petra was designated a World Heritage Site. In a popular poll in 2007, it was also named one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. The Petra Archaeological Park (PAP) became an autonomous legal entity over the management of this site in August 2007.\n\nThe Bedoul belong to one of the Bedouin tribes whose cultural heritage and traditional skills were proclaimed by UNESCO on the Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2005 and inscribed in 2008.\nIn 2011, following an 11-month project planning phase, the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority in association with DesignWorkshop and JCP s.r.l published a Strategic Master Plan that guides planned development of the Petra Region. This is intended to guide planned development of the Petra Region in an efficient, balanced and sustainable way over the next 20 years for the benefit of the local population and of Jordan in general. As part of this, a Strategic Plan was developed for Umm Sayhoun and surrounding areas.\nThe process of developing the Strategic Plan considered the area's needs from five points of view:\n\nA socio-economic perspective\nThe perspective of Petra Archaeological Park\nThe perspective of Petra's tourism product\nA land use perspective\nAn environmental perspective\nThe site suffers from a host of threats, including collapse of ancient structures, erosion due to flooding and improper rainwater drainage, weathering from salt upwelling, improper restoration of ancient structures, and unsustainable tourism. The last has increased substantially, especially since the site received widespread media coverage in 2007 during the New 7 Wonders of the World Internet and cellphone campaign. Tourism has steadily grown, with Petra receiving 1.2 million total visitors in 2019.\nIn an attempt to reduce the problems, the Petra National Trust (PNT) was established in 1989. It has worked with numerous local and international organisations on projects that promote the protection, conservation, and preservation of the Petra site. Moreover, UNESCO and ICOMOS recently collaborated to publish their first book on human and natural threats to the sensitive World Heritage sites. They chose Petra as its first and the most important example of threatened landscapes. The presentation Tourism and Archaeological Heritage Management at Petra: Driver to Development or Destruction? (2012) was the first in a series to address the very nature of these deteriorating buildings, cities, sites, and regions.\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) released a video in 2018 highlighting the abuse of working animals in Petra. PETA claimed that animals are forced to carry tourists or pull carriages every day. The video showed handlers beating and whipping working animals, with beatings intensifying when animals faltered. PETA also showed some wounded animals, including camels with fly-infested, open wounds. The Jordanian authority running the site responded by proposing a veterinary clinic, and by undertaking to spread awareness among animal handlers. In 2020, more video released by PETA indicated that conditions for the animals had not improved and, in 2021, the organization was running what appeared to be the only veterinary clinic in the area.\n\nPetra is a site at the intersection of natural and cultural heritage forming a unique cultural landscape. Ever since Johann Ludwig Burckhardt aka Sheikh Ibrahim had re-discovered the ruin city in Petra, Jordan, in 1812, the cultural heritage site has attracted different people who shared an interest in the ancient history and culture of the Nabataeans such as travellers, pilgrims, painters and savants. However, it was not until the late 19th century that the ruins were systematically approached by archaeological researchers. Since then regular archaeological excavations and ongoing research on the Nabataean culture have been part of today's UNESCO world cultural heritage site Petra. Through the excavations in the Petra Archaeological Park an increasing number of Nabataean cultural heritage is being exposed to environmental impact. A central issue is the management of water impacting the built heritage and the rock hewn facades. The large number of discoveries and the exposure of structures and findings demand conservation measures respecting the interlinkage between the natural landscape and cultural heritage, as especially this connection is a central challenge at the UNECSO World Heritage Site.\nIn recent years different conservation campaigns and projects were established at the cultural heritage site of Petra. The main works first focussed on the entrance situation of the Siq to protect tourists and to facilitate access. Also, different projects for conservation and conservation research were conducted. Following is a list of projects, to be continued.\n\n1958 Restoration of the third pillar of the Treasury building (Al-Khazneh).

          "summary": "Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء‎, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα, lit. 'Rock'), originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu (Nabataean Aramaic: 𐢛𐢚𐢒‎ or 𐢛𐢚𐢓𐢈‎, *Raqēmō), is an ancient city and archaeological site in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also called the \"Rose City\" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved. The city is one of the New 7 Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and was settled by the Nabataeans, a nomadic Arab people, in the 4th century BC. Petra would later become the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom in the second century BC. The Nabataeans invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub, which gained them considerable revenue. Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and thus were able to defend their kingdom. They were particularly skillful in agriculture, stone carving, and rainwater harvesting.\nPetra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants. Nabataea fell to the Romans in 106 AD, who annexed and renamed it Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.\nUNESCO has described Petra as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\". Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Visitor numbers reach close to a million tourists every year.",

          "content": "البتراء او البترا او البطراء مدينه اثريه وتاريخيه تقع في محافظه معان في جنوب المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه. تشتهر بعمارتها المنحوته بالصخور ونظام قنوات جر المياه القديمه. اُطلق عليها قديمًا اسم «سلع»، كما سُميت بـ «المدينه الورديه» نسبهً لالوان صخورها الملتويه.\nاُسست البتراء تقريبًا في عام 312 ق.م عاصمه لمملكه الانباط. وقد تبوات مكانهً مرموقهً لسنوات طويله، حيث كان لموقعها على طريق الحرير، والمتوسط لحضارات بلاد ما بين النهرين وفلسطين ومصر، دورًا كبيرًا جعل من دوله الانباط تمسك بزمام التجاره بين حضارات هذه المناطق وسكانها. وتقع المدينه على منحدرات جبل المذبح، بين مجموعه من الجبال الصخريه الشاهقه، التي تُشكل الخاصره الشماليه الغربيه لشبه الجزيره العربيه، وتحديدًا وادي عربه، الممتد من البحر الميت وحتى خليج العقبه.\nبقي موقع البتراء غير مكتشف للغرب طيله الفتره العثمانيه، حتى اعاد اكتشافها المستشرق السويسري يوهان لودفيغ بركهارت عام 1812. وقد اُدرجت مدينه البتراء على لائحه التراث العالمي التابعه لليونسكو في عام 1985. واختيرت احدى عجائب الدنيا السبع الجديده عام 2007.\nوتُعد البتراء اليوم، رمزًا للاردن، واكثر الاماكن جذبًا للسياح على مستوى المملكه. كما انها واحده من اهم الوجهات السياحيه لزعماء العالم. ولقد احتفلت المدينه بالزائر رقم مليون لاول مره في تاريخ السياحه الاردنيّه، وذلك في شهر تشرين الثاني/ نوفمبر 2019.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع مدينه البتراء في لواء البتراء التابع لمحافظه معان، على بعد 225 كيلومتر جنوب العاصمه الاردنيه عمّان، والى الغرب من الطريق الصحراوي الذي يصل بين عمّان ومدينه العقبه على ساحل خليج العقبه. يقع اللواء في الجهه الغربيه من مدينه معان مركز المحافظه، ويبعد عنها 36 كم. ويتواجد على امتداد سلسله جبال الشراه المطله على وادي عربه وطبيعتها الجغرافيه المنحدره والمحاطه بالجبال. تبلغ مساحه اللواء 900 كم2 ، اما مساحه المحميه الاثريه فتبلغ 264 كم2. وتُعتبر البتراء احد مناطق هذا اللواء، ومركزه مدينه وادي موسى.\nتتميز مدينه البتراء بانها مدينه محفوره في الحجر الرملي الملون في صخور جبال وادي موسى الوردي، ولذا سُميت بـ «المدينه الورديه». ويمكن للزائر ان يصل اليها بواسطه السياره وبعدها يبدا في السير بين جنبات مدينه ضخمه محفوره في الصخر، ومختبئه خلف حاجز منيع من الجبال المتراصه التي بالكاد يسهل اختراقها يطلق عليه اسم السيق.\n\nالجيولوجيا\nمن اهم المظاهر الجيولوجيه في مناطق البتراء؛ التكشفات الصخريه والتي تبين معظم الفترات والعصور والاعمار على السلم الجيولوجي، لتاثر المنطقه بعمليات تكتونيه ناجمه عن حركه انفتاح وتوسع صدع البحر الميت، حيث تتكشف صخور القاعده الجرانيتيه في وادي نمله شمال غرب منطقه بيضاء البترا، والتي تعود الى فترات ما قبل الكامبري بعمر 650 مليون سنه.\nتمتاز منطقه البتراء بتكشفات الصخور الرسوبيه والرمال التي تتكون من فتات معادن الفلدسبار وغيرها والتي تعود للعصر الكامبري والاوردوفيشي، حيث ترسّبت في بيئات نهريه ادت الى نقلها وترسيبها انذاك، ومن ثم وللاعلى تتكشف مباشره صخور العصر الكريتاسي وبوجود عدم توافق ترسيبي يفسر بعمليات؛ زوال صخور عصور معروفه كالسيلوري والجوراسي وانقطاع في الترسيب في تلك العصور. توجد ايضا تراكيب جيولوجيه مثاليه كالصدوع والطيات، والمقاطع الجيولوجيه المثاليه التي تتجمل بالوان زاهيه، اضافه الينابيع والكهوف الطبيعيه، والاحافير الممثله لكافه العصور الجيولوجيه. من اهم التراكيب الجيولوجيه في البترا هي؛ صدع وادي موسى، حيث تاثرت المنطقه بصدع راسي اتجاهه شمال- جنوب؛ وهو احد الصدوع الرئيسيه في جنوب الاردن. وتعمل سلطه اقليم البترا على التمهيد من اجل اطلاق مشروع السياحه الجيولوجيه من خلال التعاون مع سلطه المصادر الطبيعيه الاردنيه، وتعد هذه التجربه الاولى من نوعها في المملكه.\n\nالحياه البريه\nينتشر شجر العرعر الفينيقي في البتراء كونها امتدادا لمناطق تواجده في المشرق العربي. وهو نوع نباتي شجري من جنس العرعر يتبع الفصيله السرويه.\nتقع البتراء في جنوب بلاد الشام، حيث وادي عربه وصحراء النقب. تعيش في هذه البيئات انواع عشبيه حوليه ومعمره. توجد كثير من الانواع البصيليه والدرنيه مثل العنصل والبلفيه (باللاتينيه: Bellevalia) من الفصيله الهليونيه والعصفلدين من الفصيله الزانثوريه. وتوجد عده انواع من الحثره (باللاتينيه: Boerhavia) ومن الصدح (باللاتينيه: Commicarpus) من الفصيله الشّبّيّه (باللاتينيه: Nyctaginaceae).\n\nتتميز منطقه النقب ببعض الانواع التي تعد امتداداً للغطاء النباتي في افريقيا. من هذه الانواع العشار الباسق (باللاتينيه: Calotropis procera) واربعه انواع من السنط احدها السنط الملتوي (باللاتينيه: Acacia tortilis). كذلك، توجد اجناس نباتيه تتواجد في معظم البيئات الشاميه المذكوره اعلاه مثل السوسن الذي ينتشر منه اكثر من ثلاثين نوعًا تتوزع على مختلف مناطق الشام حسب تاقلم كل نوع منها. كذلك ينتشر اكثر من خمسين نوعًا من جنس الثوم (الفصيله الثوميه) واربعين من القنطريون (الفصيله النجميه) في مناطق الشام المختلفه من مرعش الى سيناء وسبعه وثلاثون نوعا من الاربيان من الفصيله النجميه.\nاما بالنسبه للحيوانات، فيعيش في البتراء كل من الجمال والخيول والماعز والحمير لتحملها حراره الاجواء ولتكيفها مع بيئتها الجافه.\n\nالمناخ\nالتاريخ\nيعود الفضل في بناء البتراء الى الانباط، الا انه قبل الانباط كان يعيش في هذه المنطقه شعب يدعى الادوميين الذين كانوا في حاله عداء دائم مع الدول المجاوره لهم. وقد استوطن الادميون التلال المحيطه بالبتراء من 1200 – 539 ق. م ولم يدخلوا البتراء بل فضّلوا الاقامه على التلال المحيطه بها، ولم يكن لديهم المام او اهتمام بالنحت او البناء في الصخر، بل كانت براعتهم محصوره في صناعه الفخاريات التي يبدو انهم نقلوها الى العرب الانباط الذين استقروا في هذه المنطقه بعد هجرتهم من الجزيره العربيه في نهايه القرن السادس قبل الميلاد. لقد احتل الادوميون جزءاً هاماً من المنطقه التي كانت عند تقاطع عده طرق تجاريه مهمه واستفادوا كثيرًا من القوافل التجاريه التي كانت تمر عبر طرقهم. ويُعتقد بان الادوميين قد هزمهم اليهود بقياده الملك سليمان الذين بسطوا سيطرتهم على هذه المنطقه لمده مائتي عام. بعد ذلك قام البابليون بغزو فلسطين، واخذوا اليهود واخذوهم اسرى. وبدا الادوميون الذين طُردوا من هذه المنطقه بالتحرك لاعاده احتلال الاراضي التي كانت فيما مضى خاضعه لسيطرتهم. ومع ذلك فقد اجتاح الانباط هذه المنطقه مره اخرى وهم قبيله بدويه ينحدرون من اصول عربيه. تعايش الانباط مع الادوميين في حياه اكثر استقرارًا.\n\nالعرب الانباط\nكانت البتراء عاصمه لدوله الانباط واهم مدن مملكتهم العربيه التي دامت ما بين 400 ق.م وحتى 106 م، وقد امتدت حدودها من ساحل عسقلان في فلسطين غربًا وحتى صحراء بلاد الشام شرقًا، ومن الشمال دمشق وحتى البحر الاحمر جنوبًا. في عام 300 قبل الميلاد، كان الانباط قد حققوا السيطره التامه على المنطقه، وبنوا لانفسهم مستعمره حضريه، حيث قاموا بنحت احيائهم السكنيه ومبانيهم وقبورهم في الصخور بجانب الجبال. وفي اوج ازدهارهم في القرن الاول قبل الميلاد كان يعيش في مدينه البتراء مايقارب 30,000 نسمه، كان يحكمهم ملك منذ العام 168 قبل الميلاد وانشاوا دوله تمثل ديمقراطيه، حيث كان الملك عرضه للمحاسبه عن كل افعاله.\nشكل موقع البتراء المتوسط بين حضارات بلاد ما بين النهرين وبلاد الشام والجزيره العربيه ومصر اهميه اقتصاديه، فقد امسكت دوله الانباط بزمام التجاره بين حضارات هذه المناطق وسكانها وكانت القوافل التجاريه تصل اليها محمله بالتوابل والبهارات من جنوب الجزيره العربيه والحرير من غزه ودمشق والحناء من عسقلان والزجاجيات من صور وصيدا واللؤلؤ من الخليج العربي.\n\nكان الانباط في البتراء يتكلمون لغه تشبه الاراميه. وقد اصبحت البتراء عاصمه ثقافيه موازيه ومساويه للمدن الفينيقيه واليونانيه، حيث يُعتقد ان الخط العربي الابجدي قد نشا وتطور في هذه المنطقه، على يد الانباط العرب. كما كُتب به الحرف العبري في مرحله ما. وقد انتشر الحرف النبطي بعد ان تبناه الاسلام، وكُتبت به لغات امم اخرى في بلاد عده لا يقل مجموعها عن خمسه عشر. لقد انتج الانباط اواني فخاريه جميله، ومباني عظيمه تاثر معظمها فيما بعد بالاسلوب الروماني. في بدايه القرن الاول الميلادي، اصبحت مدينه البتراء مركز التجاره مجدداً بسبب الحروب الدائمه بين مصر وسوريه. وخلال وقت قصير، اصبح الانباط اثرياء واقوياء بما في الكفايه ليبسطوا سيطرتهم على المنطقه. ولكونهم زادوا ثراءً تحسن اسلوب حياتهم، وهو ما انعكس بدوره على الديكورات الفخمه الموجوده على قبور الانباط الجدد.\nاستطاع العرب الانباط في البدايات، مقاومه محاولات السيطره عليهم واخضاعهم، وابقوا منطقه دائره الاردن التاريخيه خاليه نسبيا من النفوذ الاجنبي. ومن بين اهم مواجهاتهم العسكريه، وقوفهم في وجه النفوذ السلوقي (اليوناني) في عام 312 ق.م. اذ استطاعوا رد الجيش اليوناني مهزومًا بعد ان قتلوا معظم افراده في الحمله الاولى، وردوا الحمله اليونانيه الثانيه بعد ان حاصر الاغريق مدينتهم لمده طويله. كذلك انتصر الانباط في اول معركه بحريه يخوضها جيش عربي، وذلك في مياه البحر الميت، وهي المعركه التي انهت احلام اليونان واطماعهم بالاستيلاء على شرق الاردن. كما واجه العرب الانباط اليهود في مواجهات واسعه سجلوا في معظمها الانتصار رغم الحمايه الرومانيه التي كانوا يتمتعون فيها.\n\nالرومان والبيزنطيون\nغزا الجنرال الروماني بومباي المملكه النبطيه في نحو عام 60 قبل الميلاد، الا انه سمح بقدر من الحكم الذاتي فيها. ولقد كانت نهايه دوله الانباط على يد الرومان عندما حاصروها ومنعوا عنها مصادر المياه سنه 106، حتى ضموها لامبراطوريتهم، واطلقوا عليها اسم مقاطعه \"Arabia Petraea\"، وعاصمتها البتراء.\nوكان الانباط قد حققوا ارباحًا كبيره من التجاره الرومانيه والهنديه والعربيه على اراضيهم. الا ان استيلاء الرومان على البتراء جعلهم يسيطرون على هذه الطرق. وقد بدا الرومان ببناء وتشييد ابنيتهم الخاصه في البتراء واقاموا في المدينه مدرجاً، كما قاموا بتشييد معبد قصر البنت، وهو البناء الوحيد الذي ما زال قائماً في قلب المدينه حيث كان يقع السوق الكبير. وفي هذا المكان كانت القوافل تقايض القوافل الاخرى القادمه من الغرب بالتوابل والعاج والعنبر والقماش. استمرت البتراء مركزًا تجاريًا مهمًا لمده قرنين اخرين من الزمن. وبعد ذلك تضاءلت اهميتها مع استمرار بعض المدن في الشمال مثل تدمر بجذب التجاره اليها. وبالتدريج غادر التجار وغادرت معهم جيوش الرومان التي كانت مهمتها حمايه الطرق التجاريه. وبعد تحول الامبراطوريه الرومانيه الى الديانه المسيحيه، حظيت البتراء بمطرانيه، وتحولت بعض ابنيتها الى كنائس. لكن المدينه التي حكمها البيزنطيون، فقدت مجدها السابق ولم يتبق منها الا الاطلال. ويبدو ان المسيحيه قد دخلت البتراء قبل وخلال الفتره المبكره من العصر البيزنطي، رغم انتشار الوثنيه جنبًا الى جنب معها، حيث كانت الكنائس والمعابد الوثنيه موجوده حتى القرن الخامس.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nاصبح من تبقى من سكان البتراء يعتاشون على الزراعه قبل وصول الاسلام للشام، وتحديدًا في سنه 636، لكن الزلزال الذي ضربها سنه 746 و 748 وزلازل اخرى قامت بافراغها من اهلها. وقد ورد ذكر منطقه البتراء وجوارها في المصادر التاريخيه المعاصره للحروب الصليبيه. وتشير هذه المصادر الى ان وادي موسى كانت منطقه خصبه، وبها مياه وفيره، كما تشير الوثائق التي تعود لهذه الفتره الى وجود كنيسه في منطقه جبل هارون. وقد قام الصليبيون بحمله عسكريه على البتراء ووادي موسى تالفت من الفرسان والمشاه في نهايه عام 1100 وبقياده ملك الفرنجه بالدوين الاول. وقد شيّدوا فيها قلعتين بعد ذلك. كما بنى المماليك مقاما للنبي هارون في البتراء على جبل يرتفع 1353 متر عن سطح البحر، في سياق اهتمامهم بالمقامات والقبور. ولكن المدينه دخلت في سبات طويل في الفتره العثمانيه، وحتى اعاده اكتشافها في عام 1812.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nمع بدء رحلات المستشرقين للوطن العربي في القرن التاسع عشر، اكتشف البتراء عام 1812م المستشرق السويسري يوهان لودفيغ بركهارت، الذي تعلم اللغه العربيه ودرس الاسلام في سوريا وجاء الى البتراء مدعيًا بانه مسلم من الهند بعد ان تنكّر بزي اسلامي، وهدفه تقديم اضحيه الى النبي هارون؛ وبذلك سمح له السكان المحليون بالدخول الى المدينه الورديه. وقد احتوى كتابه المطبوع عام 1828 والمعروف باسم «رحلات في سوريا والديار المقدسه» على صور للبتراء.\nتطورت اهميه البتراء اداريًا مع نشوء اماره شرق الاردن في عام 1921، حيث تاسست مديريه ناحيه في وادي موسى. وفي عام 1973 رفعت الوحده الاداريه من ناحيه الى قضاء. في عام 1996 رُفعت الى لواء. في عام 2001 تغير اسم لواء وادي موسى الى لواء البتراء. وتعتبر مدينه وادي موسى مركز اللواء.\nنفًّذت مديريه المصادر التراثيه الاردنيه 22 حفريه اثريه مع عدد من البعثات الغربيه اُنجزت في منطقتيّ البترا والبيضا. وقد وُضعت مدينه البتراء منذ عام 1985 ضمن قائمه اليونسكو لمواقع التراث العالمي، نظرًا لتفرد المدينه من الناحيه الطبيعيه والتاريخيه والجغرافيه، ولاحتوائها على مزيج فريد من تراث الحضارات القديمه التي تنتمي الى حضارات متنوعه يذكر منها اثار الادوميين، واليونانيين، والانباط، والرومان، والبيزنطيين، والصليبين، والمماليك. ومنذ ذلك التاريخ عقدت عده ورش عمل، عنيت بترميم وحمايه اثار البتراء. وتاسست في عام 1992 اللجنه الوطنيه لحمايه البتراء في المجلس الاعلى للعلوم والتكنولوجيا، وقامت جمعيات غير حكوميه اعلنت برامج في هذا المجال. وقد وصل عدد زوار البتراء الاجمالي في عام 2010 الى 900,000 زائر، مقتربًا من الطاقه الاستيعابيه القصوى لمحميه البتراء الاثريه والبالغه 1.13 مليون\nزائر حسب تقديرات منظمه اليونسكو.\nوقد اختيرت البتراء في 7 تموز/ يوليو 2007 ثانيه عجائب الدنيا السبع الجديده، بعد الدعم الرسمي للتصويت، حيث اُعتبر الامر واجبًا وطنيًا. وقامت الحكومه الاردنيه بحملات دعائيه ضخمه من اجل البتراء في الصحف الاردنيه والاذاعه الاردنيه والتلفزيون الاردني لتحفّز مواطني المملكه على التصويت. وبدات الشركات باطلاق الحملات لدعم التصويت.\nكما تاسس في البتراء عام 2009، سلطه ذات استقلال مالي واداري، هي سلطه اقليم البترا التنموي السياحي. والتي تهدف الى تنميه الاقليم وتطويره سياحيًا واقتصاديًا واجتماعيًا وثقافيًا، والمساهمه في تنميه المجتمع المحلي.\n\nالعماره\nتاثرت العماره النبطيه عمومًا، وعماره البتراء خصوصًا، بفن العماره المصريه والاشوريه والاغريقيه. ويظهر هذا جلّيًا في كثير من مباني العماره الجنائزيه المتمثله بالمقابر الملكيه المنحوته، والمقابر المبنيه بالحجر المقطوع. لقد اهتم الانباط اهتمامًا كبيرًا بمقابرهم، مما انعكس في عمارتها التي حُشد فيها الكثير من الفنون المعماريه والفنيه ومما يوحي باهتمام الانباط «بالحياه الاخره» بالنسبه للاموات. وبالنسبه للمقابر الملكيه المنحوته، فتُعتبر من اكثر ما اشتهر به الانباط. وقد اُجريت عليها العديد من الدراسات المتخصصه اظهرت ان المهندس النبطي جمع بين التاثيرات الخارجيه من الحضارات المجاوره مع الذوق النبطي. ويمكن مشاهده الكثير من هذه القبور في اماكن مختلفه من البتراء وما حولها وخصوصًا في الطريق قبل الوصول الى السيق. من قبور البتراء الشهيره: قبر «المسلات» وقبر «الجره» و «القبر ذو النوافذ».\nتتسم عماره الانباط باستخدم العديد من المواد حسب توفرها في البيئه، فبالاضافه الى نحت الصخور الرمليه والكلسيه وجعلها مساكن ومنشات وقبور وتماثيل وغيرها، فقد استخدمت كل انواع الحجاره في البناء النبطي حيثما فرضت البيئه ذلك، ففي الصحراء مثلا، جرى استخدام الحجاره البازلتيه السوداء لمختلف اغراض البناء. وفي معظم الابنيه الكبيره كالمعابد استخدمت فنون معماريه كثيره منها الاقواس الكبيره والصغيره التي تعتمد على تراص الحجاره لا على المونه او الدعم الارضي بالاعمده، وفي بعض الحالات جرى سقف بعض الابنيه او الحجرات بصفوف متلاصقه من هذه الحجاره قبل ان تجري تغطيتها بالملاط الطيني من فوقها لدرء امطار الشتاء ولعزل حراره الصيف ايضًا. وبالنسبه للمواد الاخرى المساعده، فقد استخدمت الاخشاب في التسقيف وصناعه الابواب والشبابيك، ويبدو ذلك في منطقه وادي موسى والبتراء بسبب توفر الاشجار في المنطقه. وعرف الانباط استخداما اخر للاخشاب في البناء من شانه تعزيز صمود الجدران امام الهزات الارضيه، حيث عثر على بقايا تلك الاخشاب في بعض الابنيه منها بناء «قصر البنت» في البتراء.\nمن جهه اخرى، يُعتبر النظام الهندسي للماء الانجاز الاهم للحضاره النبطيه بالمدينه، والذي جعل الحياه ممكنه في هذه المنطقه الجافه من الصحراء الاردنيه. وقد تضمن ذلك النظام انظمه لحفظ المياه واشتمل على السدود التي كانت تجمع مياه الامطار في اشهر الشتاء. كما استخدم الانباط نظاماً محكماً من القنوات والانابيب الفخاريه لتوزيع المياه في كافه انحاء المدينه.\nالتخطيط الحضري\n\nلقد بُنيت مباني البتراء وفق مخطط المدينه العام، حيث الشارع الرئيس الذي تاثر بمخطط المدينه الرومانيه، اذ ان الشارع يكاد يقسم المدينه الى نصفين، وهو يحاذي الوادي مما اضطر المهندس النبطي لبناء بعض القنوات تحت ارض الشارع. وكذلك العبارات والاقواس الحجريه التي ترتفع عن سيل الوادي في فصل الشتاء. وما يزال بالامكان ملاحظه بعض اثار هذه المرافق في الشارع الرئيسي بعد الانتهاء من ساحه الخزنه.\nيُعد الشارع المُعمد من اهم شوارع مدينه البتراء، حيث قام الانباط بتشييده، ثم اعاد الرومان بنائه في عام 106 بعد احتلالهم للبتراء. يبلغ عرضه 6 امتار، وقد كانت تقوم على جانبيه مباني من طابق واحد الى طابقين، كما يوجد على يسار الشارع المعمد باتجاه الجنوب مجموعه من السلالم تقود لساحه مكشوفه تسمى بـ «السوق»، حيث كانت تجري كافه انواع النشاطات والمعاملات التجاريه. وعلى ما يبدو ان هذه المنطقه كانت القلب النابض للمدينه ومركز النشاطات التجاريه المختلفه منذ القرن الثالث ق.م. وقد استمر استعمال الشارع خلال الفتره البيزنطيه في القرنين الرابع والخامس وحتى السادس.\nيوجد في المدينه ايضًا احد الطرق المشهوره، وهو شارع الواجهات. ويقع بالقرب من منطقه الخزنه، حيث يبدا السيق بالاتساع تدريجيًا حيث يصل الزوار الى منطقه مفتوحه وعلى الجانبين يوجد عددًا من واجهات المدافن النبطيه المزينه بالمسننات والكورنيشات والادراج المقلوبه. ولقد دُمر بعض هذه الواجهات بفعل العوامل الطبيعيه، وربما تعود هذه الواجهات الى موظفين كبار في الدوله او بعض الامراء.\n\nالمواقع الاثريه داخل البتراء\nاكتشف نحو 3,000 معلم اثري في البتراء، تشكل منها المعالم المعروفه نحو 800 معلمًا، اهمها:\n\nالسيق\nهو الطريق الرئيس المؤدي لمدينه البتراء. وهو شق صخري يتلوّى بطول نحو 1200 متر وبعرض يتراوح من 3 - 12 متر، ويصل ارتفاعه الى نحو 80 متر. يُعتبر الجزء الاكبر منه طبيعي، بالاضافه الى جزء اخر نحته الانباط. ينتهي السيق في الجهه المقابله للخزنه.\nيُمكن مشاهده بقايا لقوس يمثل بوابه المدينه في بدايه السيق، الذي يوجد على جانبيه قنوات لجر المياه ممتده من عيون وادي موسى في الخارج الى المدينه في الداخل. كما يمكن مشاهده السدود الجانبيه، التي اقيمت في مكان السدود النبطيه الاصليه، لمنع تدفق المياه الى السيق، وحجزها والاستفاده منها. لقد كانت ارضيه السيق مبلطه ببلاطات حجريه جزء منها يمكن مشاهدته في مكانه الاصلي. وقد زُينت جوانب السيق بالمنحوتات النبطيه ومعظمها منحوتات تمثل الهه. وتوجد تماثيل الالهه ومحاريبها قريبه جداً من هذه القنوات بل وملاصقه لها احيانا، لاعتقاد الانباط وايمانهم الشديد بان المياه مقدسه.\nيمكن ايضا مشاهده مجموعه من المنحوتات على الجانب الايسر من السيق تُعرف باسم «اصنام سابينوس»، وقد سُمّيت هذه المجموعه بهذا الاسم لوجود نقش باليونانيه تحت الحنيه الثانيه على يسار الزائر وهو متجه لاخر السيق. يشير النقش الى ان سابينوس ابن الاسكندر المقدوني، والذي جاء من درعا، امر بنحت هذه الحنيات او المحاريب تمجيداً للالهه النبطيه. ومن المنحوتات المهمه ايضا بقايا منحوتات لجمال ورجل تمثل قافله تجاريه، حيث اشتهر الانباط بالتجاره، وكانت احد اسباب ثرائهم الواسع.\n\nالخزنه\nيُعتبر مبنى الخزنه المنحوته في الصخر، اشهر معالم البتراء واكثرها اهميه، حيث اختار الانباط موقعها بعنايه ليكون اول معلم يواجه الزائر بعد دخول المدينه. وقد سُمّيت بهذا الاسم لاعتقاد البدو المحليين سابقًا بان الجره الموجوده في اعلى الواجهه تحوي كنزًا، ولكنها في الواقع ضريح ملكي. تتكون واجهه الخزنه من طابقين بعرض 25 مترا وارتفاع 39 مترا. وقد افرغت مئات الاف الامتار المكعبه من الحجر الرملي من الخزنه عندما اُعيد اكتشافها في القرن التاسع عشر، لتظهر الواجهه بوضعها النهائي الحالي. ويتكون الطابق السفلي من سته اعمده على طول الواجهه الاماميه تقف فوق مصطبه في وسطها سلم، وتتوج الاعمده من الاعلى بثلاثه ارباع عمود، يبلغ طول العمود في الطابق السفلي نحو 12 مترا، وفي الطابق العلوي يبلغ ارتفاعه 9 امتار، كما يبلغ ارتفاع الجره في الاعلى نحو 3,5 مترا.\nويظهر التناظر الكبير في الواجهه، بالاضافه الى المزيج بين الفنون المعماريه المصريه والهلنستيه مع الطابع المعماري النبطي. وحول هدف انشاء هذا المبنى عده اراء، فيرى بعض علماء الاثار انه بُني معبدًا او مكان لحفظ الوثائق، ولكن الحفريات الاثريه الحديثه في البتراء اثبتت وجود مدافن اسفل ساحه مبنى الخزنه، والتي يمكن مشاهدتها الان من الاعلى من خلال الشبك الحديدي الموجود فوقها. كما ان هذه المدافن قُطعت لبناء الخزنه مع المحافظه عليها. وبذلك تكون الخزنه مدفنا. ويثبت مع القرن الاول الميلادي زمن الملك الحارث الرابع ملك الانباط. وعلى الاغلب تشكل مدفناً لهذا الملك.\nويتكون مبنى الخزنه من الداخل من ثلاث حجرات، اثنتان على الجانب وواحده في الوسط. والحجرتان الجانبيتان خاليتان عدا عن قبر حفر في الحجره الغربيه، اما الحجره الوسطى فيصعد اليها بدرج ويبلغ طولها 12,5 متر، وعلى جوانبها الثلاث توجد حجرات صغيره للدفن. ويوجد على جانبي مبنى الخزنه من الخارج ثقوب صغيره على الجانبين مزدوجه في النصف الاعلى من مبنى الخزنه ربما تكون استخدمت لتثبيت السقالات اثناء عمليه النحت. ويوجد في اعلى مبنى الخزنه قناه بعرض 90 سم لتصريف المياه ومنعها للنزول على هذه الواجهه. وقد قامت الحفريات الحديثه بتنظيف هذه القناه.\n\nالدير\nوهو من المباني المهمه في منطقه البتراء، ويعود تاريخه الى النصف الاول من القرن الاول قبل الميلاد، ويتكون المبنى من طابقين، ويُعتقد انه احتوى على تماثيل متحركه التيجان. وهو اكبر حجماً من مبنى الخزنه، حيث يصل عرضه الى 50 مترا، اما ارتفاعه فيصل الى 50 مترا.\nويُعتقد ان واجهه مبنى الدير قد حُوِّلت الى دير للرهبان اثناء فتره حكم الدوله البيزنطيه في بلاد الشام، وذلك لوجود اثار للصلبان المحفوره في الصخر في الغرفه الوحيده الموجوده في الطابق السفلي من الواجهه. كما يُعتقد بانه الساحه الواقعه امام الواجهه قد بُلّطت.\n\nمسرح البتراء\nمن اكبر المباني في البتراء، ولقد بُني في القرن الاول للميلاد على شكل نصف دائره بقطر 95 مترا، وبارتفاع 23 مترا. وهو منحوت في الصخر باستثناء الجزء الامامي منه فهو مبني، ويستوعب المسرح من 7 - 10 الاف مشاهد، كما تتكون مقاعد المشاهدين من 45 صفًا من المقاعد المقسمه افقيًا الى ثلاثه اقسام، الاسفل 11 صفا والاوسط 34 صفا والعلوي 10 صفوف، وهي مقسمه ايضًا من خلال الادراج الخمسه الى سته اجزاء، ويوجد فوق المدرجات قطع صخري مقطوع من بعض المدافن السابقه لبناء المسرح.\nقطعت ساحه الاوركسترا بالصخر، كما ان الممران الجانبيان للساحه مقطوعان ايضًا في الصخر ومسقفان بالحجاره على شكل عقد. اما الجدار الخلفي للمسرح فيتكون بالاصل من 3 طوابق ومزيّن بالكوات والاعمده وواجهته مغطاه بالالواح الرخاميه.\n\nقصر البنت\nيُطلق عليه ايضًا «قصر بنت فرعون»، وهو معبد نبطي من القرن الاول قبل الميلاد. وتكمن اهميه هذا القصر بانه احد مباني البتراء القليله التي صمدت رغم الزلازل، وذلك بسبب طريقه بنائهِ باستخدام مداميك وضع فيها خشب العرعر، مما جعل جدرانه اكثر طواعيه للحركه اثناء الزلازل. ان الحنيه التي تقع على يمين الساحه الاماميه لقصر البنت كانت قد صممت اصلا لتخليد الامبراطور الروماني وعائلته عندما احتل الرومان مدينه البتراء، حيث ان هذا التقليد معروف عند الرومان.\nوقد كان هذا المعبد مخصصًا لواحده من الالهه الرئيسيه، ويجادل البعض ان هذه الالهه هي اللات فيما يعتقد اخرون انها العزى، وراى اخرون انه للاله الاعلى ذو الشرى. وكان من المثير للنقاش علاقه هذا المعبد بالالهه ايزيس المعبوده المصريه، وكان ذلك من الظواهر المستغربه.\n\nالمحكمه\nهو مبنى متكون من مجموعه من الواجهات المهمه، واولها «قبر الجره»، ويعود تاريخه الى النصف الاول من القرن الاول الميلادي، ويقع على الجهه المقابله للمدرج النبطي. ويبلغ عرض الواجهه نحو 16 مترا، وبارتفاع 26 مترا. وتتكون من طابقين من الجدران التي تدعم اقواسًا تحت مستوى صاله المدفن، وهي مدمجه مع حجرات دفن جزء منها منحوت والاخر مبني. ويوجد سلم يصعد الى ساحه المدفن في الاعلى. ويتكون المدفن من صاله مربعه الشكل بطول نحو 19 مترا. وكانت القبور في الجزء الخلفي للمدفن، ولكنه حُول الى كنيسه في القرن الخامس الميلادي. وتوجد كتابه يونانيه تذكر ان تحويل المكان الى كنيسه عام 447 ومكتوب ذلك على الجزء الخلفي الايسر من الجدار.\n\nالمعبد الكبير\nوهو اضخم المباني في مدينه البتراء، ويقع هذا المعبد على الجهه الجنوبيه من الشارع المُعمد. ويتكون البناء من مدخل رئيسي يرتبط مع الشارع، ثم ساحه مقدسه سفلى وعلى جانبيها يوجد بنائين متطابقين على شكل نصف دائري وعلى جانبيهما توجد ادراج عريضه تؤدي الى الساحه العليا المقدسه، وفوقها يقع المعبد او قدس الاقداس.\n\nالمذبح\nاُستخدم هذا المبنى في فتره الصليبيين ليكون صله وصل وربط ما بين قلعتي الوعيره والحبيس. اما المذبح نفسه، فاصوله ادوميه. وبعد الاحتفالات التي كانت تجرى في المدرج كانت المواكب الدينيه تصعد الى المذبح من المنطقه المجاوره للمدرج مرورًا بوادي المحافر حتى تصل للمذبح حيث تقدم القرابين التي كانت حيوانيه والمذبح يتكون من ساحه مركزيه محاطه بمقاعد من ثلاث جهات. ان اول ما يمكن رؤيته في هذه المنطقه هو مسلتان مقطوعتان في الصخر ويعتقد بانهما يرمزان لاهم الهه الانباط ذو الشرى ورفيقته الدائمه العزى. كما يُشاهد في منطقه الدرج الصاعد للمذبح بقايا جدران وبرج يُعتقد بان اساساته ادوميه اعيد استخدامه في الفتره النبطيه. ويوجد في الجهه الغربيه مذبحين احدهما مستطيل الشكل ربما استخدم لعمليه الطواف، والاخر دائري الشكل يُعتقد انه كان يستخدم لوضع دماء القرابين او النبيذ كما يحتوي هذا المعلم على بركه او خزان ماء صغير ويمكن مشاهده الجزء السفلي للمدينه من هذا الموقع.\n\nمواقع اخرى\nيوجد المدينه الكثير من المعالم الاخرى ذات الوظائف المختلفه، منها ضريح الجندي الروماني وقاعه الاحتفالات الجنائزيه. ويعتقد بوجود ساحه مركزيه بين هذين المعلمين. اما القاعه الجنائزيه فقد تميزت عن غيرها بوجود دعامات منحوته وملتصقه بالجدران وحنى مستطيله طوليه الشكل خلف المقاعد مباشرهً، اما ضريح الجندي الروماني فربما اُعيد استخدامه بعد 106 م وذلك لوجود ثلاثه تماثيل ذات رداء عسكري روماني موضوعه في حنايا هذه الواجهه.\nكما تحوي البتراء عددًا من المعابد الصغيره في البتراء مثل معبد الاسود المجنحه، ومعبد البستان. بالنسبه لمعبد الاسود المجنحه، فيقع على الجهه المقابله لمبنى قصر البنت، ويتكون بناء المعبد من شرفه اماميه تتقدمها الاعمده بطول 9,5 متر. ويجري الدخول منها عبر بوابه عريضه الى قاعه المعبد الرئيسيه وهي مربعه الشكل وتحيط بها الاعمده. وكانت تاجيات بعض اعمده المعبد تحمل اسودًا مجنحهً ومن هنا جاءت تسميه المعبد. وقد بُلطت ارضيه القاعه الرئيسه برخام ابيض مموج بالبني بينما بلطت المنصه بالرخام الابيض والاسود وزخرفت جدران المعبد الداخليه بالرخام والقصاره الملونه والجض وعثر على قطع جصيه باشكال رؤوس ادميه واقنعه مسرحيه واشكال ازهار كانت مثبته على الجدران. وقد دُمر المعبد والمنشات المحيطه به بزلزال عام 363 م. اما بالنسبه لمعبد البستان، فيتميز بوجود جدار ضخم بجواره يقوم عليه الجزء الجنوبي للشرفه العلويه وبقايا غرف يبدو ان احداها كانت معقوده يتخلل جدرانها احدى عشر حنيه.\nومن المباني الجنائزيه الاخرى في المدينه، قبر المسلات، مدفن الحرير، مدفن سكستوس فلورنتينوس، قبر القصر، القبر الكورنثي،  وقبر الرينيسانس.\n\nالسكان\nبلغ عدد سكان لواء البتراء (الذي تشكل مدينه البتراء جزءاً منه) في عام 2009 نحو 28,760 نسمه، معظمهم من البدو. وكانت قبائل من «عرب اللياثنه» قد استوطنت المكان اثناء اعاده اكتشاف الغرب للبتراء في القرن التاسع عشر. كما كانت عشائر مختلفه تسكن البتراء منذ خمسينيات القرن العشرين، كعشائر «العمارين» و «البدول»، حيث كانوا يسكنون في كهوف داخل البتراء حتى عام 1985، حين رحّلتهم الحكومه الاردنيه الى اسكانات خارج المدينه الاثريه كبلده «البيضاء» التي تبعد عن البترا نحو 10 كم. ويُقدر عددهم من 1,000 - 3,000 شخص يتقن الكثير منهم العديد من اللغات الاجنبيه رغم اميّه الكثير منهم، بسبب اختلاطهم بالسيّاح الاجانب.\nوقد ادرج المجال الثقافي لبدو البتراء ووادي رم في 25 تشرين الثاني/ نوفمبر 2005 الى قائمه اليونسكو لروائع التراث الثقافي اللامادي الانساني. ويقع هذا المجال البدوي الصحراوي قرب مدينه البتراء، داخل منطقه جبليه شبه قاحله ومساحات صحراويه. وهو مجال تمارس فيه مجموعه من الممارسات والمهارات الثقافيه اللاماديه، المرتبطه بالحياه الرعويه التقليديه. فقد حافظ بدو البتراء ووادي الرم على معرفه مميزه في مجال الثروه النباتيه والحيوانيه، وفي حقل الطب التقليدي، وتربيه الجمال وحياكه الخيام والترحال وتسلّق الجبال. وهو ما يقع تناقله عبر الاجيال شفويا وبالممارسه. بالاضافه الى غيرها من الاشكال الثقافيه كالاساطير والشعر والحكايات الشعبيه والاغاني.\n\nالنشاط الاقتصادي\nشكّل معدن النحاس، عصب الحياه الاقتصاديه وعنصرًا هامًا في تدعيم نفوذ وقوه حضاره الانباط. وامتدت اراضي المملكه النبطيه عبر مساحات واسعه، فكان تحت نفوذها اراضي وادي ضانا، حيث اقيم اقدم مناجم للنحاس في العالم، وهي مناجم النحاس في وادي فنان. اضافه الى صناعه الفخار، حيث يعتبر الفخار النبطي من افضل وادق الفخار الذي صنع في العالم، لما عرف من منظر واتقان. وهو رقيق جدًا لدرجه انه يُطلق عليه «قشره البيض».\n\nوقد اشتهر الانباط بالتجاره، وكانت مدينه البتراء محط استراحه للقوافل التجاريه. وهذا ما جعل انتيجونوس - احد قاده الاسكندر المقدوني - بغزو الانباط في عام 312 ق.م. ومع مرور الزمن اصبح الانباط يتمتعون بكيان ونفوذ كبيرين في المنطقه وازدهر فن المعمار والبناء وسك العملات وصناعه الفخار وفنون النحت وغيرها. وتعكس عاصمتهم مدينه البتراء تلك الفنون في اجمل صورها.\n\nاستطاع الانباط تطوير طرق الزراعه الجافه والحصاد المائي، مما يعكس قدره الانسان النبطي على التكيف مع ظروف الحياه الجافه وتطويع الطبيعه، ففنون الزراعه الجافه وطرق الحصاد المائي ما زالت مستخدمه حتى الوقت الحاضر، ومما يجدر ذكره ان العديد من العلماء الغربين استطاعوا نقل التقنيات النبطيه القديمه والمستخدمه في الزراعه الجافه والحصاد المائي ويرجع الفضل بهذا حقيقه الى الانباط.\nاما حاليًا، فتُعتبر البتراء اهم المواقع السياحيه جذبًا للسياح على مستوى الاردن، وبذا لها عائد اقتصادي كبير على البلاد. كما تشكل البتراء اليوم، عمق الاردن الحضاري، وجانبًا هامًا من مضمون مزيج الهويه التاريخيه لهذا البلد. كما تحتل هذه المدينه التاريخيه اليوم، المرتبه الاولى اردنيًا من حيث خلق العماله المحليه ومنطقه جذب سياحي للمشاريع المحليه المدره للدخل ومنطقه جذب للقطاع الخاص، كما انها شكلت فئه متوسطه بالنسبه للبيئه والمشاريع الحكوميه.\n\nالسياحه\nتضم البتراء عددًا كبيرًا من الفنادق ذات تصنيف خمس نجوم وما دون لاستيعاب الاعداد الكبيره من الزائرين لمحميه الاثار في المدينه، حيث بلغ عددهم قرابه 480,000 زائر في عام 1999، فيما ارتفع العدد الى 900,000 عام 2010. كما تحوي هذه المحميه بدورها على عدد كبير من الاسواق الشرقيه. من الجدير بالذكر ان جرش تلي مدينه البتراء من حيث عدد الزوار، تليهما كل من المناطق التاليه تنازليًا: عجلون ومادبا والكرك وام قيس ووادي رم. في عام 2019، احتفلت المدينه باستقبال الزائر رقم مليون لاول مره في تاريخها، في حدث اعتُبر محطه فارقه في مسيره السياحه الاردنيه. وقد نُظمت فعاليات احتفاليه بهذه المناسبه.\nمن جهه اخرى، افتتح في نيسان/ ابريل 1994 متحف البتراء النبطي في المدينه الى جانب متحف اخر هو متحف البتراء القديم، الذي تاسس عام 1963. ويحتوي المتحف النبطي ما يقارب 600 قطعه اثريه معروضه في خزائن العرض؛ حيث يتالف من ثلاث قاعات رئيسيه: القاعه الاولى تشتمل شرحاً عن تاريخ الانباط وجيولوجيه البتراء، بالاضافه الى قطع اثريه تعود الى العصر الحجري الحديث. اما القاعه الثانيه، فهي مخصصه للمكتشفات من الحفريات الاثريه، ومرتبه حسب تسلسلها الزمني بدءاً من العصرالحجري وحتى القرن السادس الميلادي. كما تضم هذه القاعه نبذه تاريخيه عن الزلازل والتجاره النبطيه وطرق القوافل والبتراء في العصور الوسطى. اما القاعه الثالثه، فتحتوي على مجموعه من الاسرجه الفخاريه حسب تطور صناعتها، والتماثيل البرونزيه والفخاريه والاطبـاق الملونه والعاديه وقطع العملات، والحلي والمجوهرات، بالاضافه لبعض القطع الفخاريه والجرار المختلفه الاحجام.\nيُقام في البتراء سنويًا ومنذ عام 2005، مهرجان البتراء السياحي الثقافي، لتشجيع السياحه الداخليه والعربيه. كما اُقيم في نفس العام مؤتمر للحائزين على جائزه نوبل في العالم. ولقد قامت سلطه اقليم البترا بالتعاون مع هيئه تنشيط السياحه في عام 2012، باحياء احتفاليات تضم العديد من الانشطه والفعاليات، بمناسبه مرور 200 عامًا على اكتشاف البتراء، والتي تهدف الى تعريف المواطن المحلي والسائح العربي والاجنبي باهميه هذه المناسبه ودورها الريادي في وضع البتراء على خارطه السياحه العالميه.\n\nاهميه دينيه\nللمدينه اهميه دينيه وتاريخيه للديانات الابراهيميه الثلاث. يعتقد اليهود انها تحتوي على اهم واثمن سر في تاريخهم، وهو تابوت العهد، الذي يحتوي على الوصايا العشر التي اعطاها الله لموسى، بالاضافه الى وجود عصا هارون فيه. يوجد مقام هارون في البتراء وعلى احد قممها المطلّه على المدينه الاثريه بارتفاع 1353 متر عن سطح البحر، مقام النبي هارون . وهو مسجد مملوكي صغير، ذو غرفه مُزينه باقمشه خضراء تعلوها قبه بيضاء وامامه حجر اسود. بُني المقام في سياق اهتمام المماليك بالمقامات والقبور. كما يدعي بعض اليهود انهم هم من بنو البتراء، حيث يعتقدون ان التوراه قد اشارت الى ان من انشا هذه المدينه هم سلاله النبي «نابوت» الابن الاكبر للنبي اسماعيل. كما يعتقدون ان اسم البتراء القديم «سالع» هو كلمه عبريه معناها «صخره»، حيث انها تُرجمت في العدد الثالث من نبوه عوبديا: «تكبر قلبك قد خدعك ايها الساكن في محاجئ الصخر». ويرجحون انها حيثما تذكر في التوراه، فانها تشير الى عاصمه ادوم، المدينه الحصينه في وادي موسى التي اشتهرت باسم «البتراء» (والتي تعني «صخره» باللغه اليونانيه). وبقد بدا اليهود بزياره البتراء بشكل ملحوظ، بعد اتفاقيه وادي عربه.\nمن جهه اخرى، ذُكر مقام هارون بالبتراء ايضًا في مخطوطات الكنيسه البيزنطيه التي تعود الى القرن السادس الميلادي باسم «دير نبينا هارون»، حيث يوجد في المدينه اثار لعدد من الكنائس البيزنطيه ذات الارضيات الفسيفسائيه. وتُعتبر كنيسه البتراء الرئيسيه، ثاني كنيسه في البتراء بعد تحويل قبر الجره (المحكمه) لكنيسه في عام 446. وتتكون الكنيسه من مبنى ذو 3 اروقه، بالاضافه الى ساحه وبرج من الجهه الغربيه وغرف جانبيه من الشمال والشرق.\nكما كان اهالي وادي موسى المسلمون يقومون بزياره المقام منذ زمن بعيد، حيث كان للمكان طقوسا ومناسك تُؤدى. وقد زار الظاهر بيبرس وكاتبه النويري المقام سنه 1276، ولم يتحدث النويري عن وجود بناء فوقه. اما اليوم، فيشهد فوقه مسجدًا صغيرًا كُتب على مدخله عباره تفيد انه عماره هذا المسجد قد جددت في عهد السلطان الملك الناصر محمد بن قلاوون. وقد زار المقام الرحّاله السويسري بيركهارت عام 1812 عندما اراد ان يزور البتراء ، فتذرّع بزياره المقام واخذ معه قربانًا ليتمكن من زياره البتراء. ثم ذهل مما راه عندما دخل البتراء من السيق.\n\nالبتراء في الفن\nاصبح المجتمع الغربي على علم بوجود البتراء اساسًا من خلال قصص جون وليام برغن الدينيه، حين وصفها بانها «مدينه ورديه قديمه بقدم الزمن». لكنه نفسه، مثل كثير من معاصريه، لم يقوموا بزياره البتراء ابدًا. حيث كانوا يعلمون عن البتراء عبر رسومات الليثوغرافيا التي رسمها الفنان الاسكتلندي ديفيد روبرتس للبتراء ومنطقه وادي موسى اثناء زيارته عام 1839، والتي تجاوز عددها عشرين لوحه ليثوغرافيه. وقد طبع العديد منها ما اعطى البتراء شهره عالميه . وقد نشرها في كتابه «مصر وسوريا وفلسطين» في عام 1839. في الواقع، حتى

          "content": "Little Petra (Arabic: البتراء الصغيرة, al-batrā aṣ-ṣaġïra), also known as Siq al-Barid (Arabic: سيق البريد, literally \"the cold canyon\"), is an archaeological site located north of Petra and the town of Wadi Musa in the Ma'an Governorate of Jordan. Like Petra, it is a Nabataean site, with buildings carved into the walls of the sandstone canyons. As its name suggests, it is much smaller, consisting of three wider open areas connected by a 450-metre (1,480 ft) canyon. It is part of the Petra Archeological Park, though accessed separately, and included in Petra's inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is often visited by tourists in conjunction with Petra itself, since it is free and usually less crowded.\nLike Petra, it was probably built during the height of Nabataean influence during the 1st century C.E. While the purpose of some of the buildings is not clear, archaeologists believe that the whole complex was a suburb of Petra, the Nabatean capital, meant to house visiting traders on the Silk Road. After the decline of the Nabataeans, it fell vacant, used only by Bedouin nomads, for centuries. Along with neighboring Beidha, Little Petra was excavated in the later 20th century by Diana Kirkbride and Brian Byrd.\nIn 2010, a biclinium, or dining room, in one of the caves was discovered to have surviving interior art depicting grapes, vines and putti in great detail with a varied palette, probably in homage to the Greek god Dionysus and the consumption of wine. The 2,000-year-old ceiling frescoes in the Hellenistic style have since been restored. While they are not only the only known example of interior Nabataean figurative painting in situ, they are a very rare large-scale example of Hellenistic painting, considered superior even to similar  later Roman paintings at Herculaneum.\n\nGeography\nLittle Petra is in an arid, mountainous desert region 1,040 metres (3,410 ft) above sea level. To the east the Arabian Desert opens up. On the west the rugged terrain soon descends into the Jordan Rift Valley, with lands around the Dead Sea as low as 400 metres (1,300 ft) below sea level.\nIt is on the local road that leaves Wadi Musa and follows the edge of the mountains around Petra itself through the small Bedouin village of Umm Sayhoun. About 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) north of Wadi Musa, a short road to the west leads to the narrow, unpaved parking lot for Little Petra and Beidha, a Neolithic site nearby. There is another small Bedouin settlement 1 km (0.6 mi) to the east.\n\nFrom the parking lot, Siq al-Barid opens up in the rock facade to the west southwest. Its name, literally \"cold canyon\", comes from its orientation and its high walls preventing the entry of most available sunlight. The modern name \"Little Petra\" comes from its similarities to the larger site to the south—both must be entered via a narrow canyon, and consist primarily of Nabataean buildings.\nThe canyon widens after 400 metres (1,300 ft). In this open area many of the sandstone walls have had openings carved into them; they were used as dwellings. On the south face is a colonnaded triclinium with a projecting pedimented portico that archaeologists believe was used as a temple, though they know very little about it.\nThe canyon then narrows again for another 50 m (150 ft), leading to another, smaller open area. The carved openings are even more numerous here, including four large triclinia. Archaeologists believe these spaces could have been used to entertain visiting merchants.\nOn the south side is a small biclinium. It has some rare surviving Nabataean paintings on its rear wall, and so it is called the Painted Room. Opposite the room on the north is a large cistern, part of the water system built by the original inhabitants.\nAt the west end of the canyon a set of steps leads to the top of the rock. There are panoramic views available of the entire Petra region. A lightly-used foot trail leads from there to Ad-Deir at Petra, 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) to the southwest.\n\nHistory\nArchaeologists believe that Little Petra was established in the 1st century CE, when the Nabataean culture was at its peak in the region. It was probably a suburb of the larger city to the south, perhaps where its more successful merchants lived, and entertained their visiting counterparts. The location may have been chosen because of the nearby older settlement of Beidha, inhabited since the earlier Neolithic era. Since investigations of the site have generally focused on the Nabataean and earlier periods, it is not known whether it was still inhabited around the same time Petra was abandoned, in the 7th century.\nFor the remainder of the millennium, and much of the next, Little Petra remained unknown to all but the Bedouin nomads who sometimes camped in it or its vicinity. Europeans, who could not visit the Arab world under Islamic rule, heard about Petra but were unsure of its existence. When Swiss traveler Jacob Burckhardt became the first nonlocal visitor to Petra since Roman times in 1812, he did not venture to its north, or did not write about it. Later global visitors to the region likewise seem to have concentrated on the main Petra site. Only in the late 1950s did British archaeologist Diana Kirkbride supplement her excavations at Petra itself with digs in the Beidha area, which included Little Petra, not described as a separate site at the time. Those digs continued until 1983, two years before UNESCO inscribed the Petra area, including Beidha and Little Petra, as a World Heritage Site.\nFollowing that designation, tourism to Petra increased, and spiked upwards again following the 1989 release of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which climaxed with the main characters riding down Petra's Siq to Al-Khazneh, where they found the Holy Grail. To assure that this growth benefited the region and did not degrade its archaeological resources, the Petra Regional Authority was created to manage all the resources within a 755-square-kilometre (292 sq mi) area. Beidha and Little Petra, among other satellite sites, were included in the 264-square-kilometre (102 sq mi) Petra Archaeological Park. The village of Umm Sayhoun was built between Wadi Musa and the two sites to house the Bedouin.\n\nPainted Biclinium\nLocated along the main avenue in Little Petra (Siq al-Barid), the Painted Biclinium is a rock-cut biclinium, or dining room, with well preserved wall paintings. In addition to offering the most abundant variety of figural painting from the Nabataean period, the frescoes of the Painted Biclinium may offer clues into the vegetation under cultivation in the area around Siq al-Barid. In addition, the paintings are proof of the importance of Dionysiac religious cult in Nabataea.\n\nLocation\nLittle Petra (Siq al-Barid) is a narrow wadi located some 8 kilometers north of the Petra city center. The wadi is a rich archaeological site, featuring rock cut tombs, stone-built architecture, and complex hydrological engineering. The site is located in the fertile northern hinterlands of Petra, a landscape that preserves evidence of large-scale viticulture and wine making, alongside the cultivation of grains, olives, and other produce. The Painted Biclinium is located on the south side of the Siq al-Barid. Surrounding the Painted Biclinium are a series of tombs and banqueting halls cut into the natural sandstone of the wadi, alongside the foundations of freestanding structures, cisterns, and water channels.\n\nDiscovery and fieldwork\nThe building and its frescoes were first photographed in the early 20th century by Père Abel (1906), and smoke damage and Arabic graffiti on the walls of the building demonstrate that the Painted Biclinium was continually occupied by local Bedouins. Studies of the frescoes relied almost exclusively on these early photographs, focusing on the visible iconography of the scenes and identifying the figures of Eros and Pan. When Nelson Glueck visited Little Petra, he did not see the frescoes at the Painted Biclinium for himself \"because of the hordes of fleas which infested it\". From 2006–2010, the Petra National Trust and the Courtauld Institute of Art in London carried out an extensive conservation project in the Painted Biclinium, which revealed new imagery on the monument and made clear the vibrancy of the color and style of the artwork. Most recently, samples of plaster and mortar were subjected to radiocarbon dating by Yarmouk University in Jordan, providing a calibrated date of 40 BCE–25 CE for the wall paintings.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Painted Biclinium comprises rock-cut stairs leading up from the floor of the Siq al-Barid, terminating at a platform hewn from the wall of the narrow wadi. The platform stands before the main entrance to the Biclinium, which leads to two chambers, one of which leads into the other. The first chamber is larger than the second, and is rectangular in shape with two benches carved out of the rock on either side of the door. The smaller, interior chamber is vaulted, and has a higher floor level than the first room. The monument parallels other feasting structures from both Little Petra and its environs, some of which are directly associated with nearby tombs and the veneration of ancestor cult, while other examples are not associated with tombs and are instead interpreted as spaces for religious feasting.\n\nFrescoes\nThe wall paintings in the Painted Biclinium can be grouped into two major scenes. The larger chamber has its south wall decorated with stucco, creating faux architectural elements reminiscent of some Pompeian wall painting.\n\nThe inner room has painted decoration in a completely different style than the larger outer room. Instead of architectural embellishment, the walls and vaulted ceiling of this room exhibit a complex program of intertwining vines, flowers, figures, several varieties of local birds, and insects. Several erotes—small winged gods associated with love and occasionally the cultivation of wine—are seen participating in viticulture management, using ladders and pruning hooks, carrying baskets of gathered grapes, and defending the vines from scavenging birds. The erotes are armed with bows, arrows, and spears. In addition to the domesticated and harvested grape vines, wild raspberry vines and field bindweed flowers wrap throughout the scene to pay homage to the local flora of Petra's northern hinterland. Twaissi et al. (2010) were able to identify an additional anthropomorphic figure in the scene in addition to the erotes, who they interpret as a representation of the Romanized Egyptian goddess. However, the overall iconographic scene and architectural parallels elsewhere in the area of Petra lend weight to the attribution of the space as a center of Dionysiac worship.\nIn addition to the figural and floral painting within the inner room of the Painted Biclinium, the room appears to have been further embellished with an intricate program of stuccoed decoration. Remnants of an entablature are preserved on the east and west walls of the room, and the center of the vault once held a stucco medallion.\n\nSignificance\nThe significance of these paintings lies in their figurative elements, a subject that is often absent in preserved Nabataean painting and other media. While a small fragment of a human face was found during the excavations of the Great Temple and the excavation of the Temple of the Winged Lions brought to light other select fragments, the frescoes at the Painted Biclinium form both the most complete painted scene in the Nabataean archaeological record and the only one remaining in situ. The features of the figural composition, including the almond eyes and round chins, have parallels with other pieces of Hellenistic painting and mosaic, while the floral and faunal subjects are distinctly local. In addition, while the archaeological record pointing to Dionysiac worship appears prolific among the Nabataean elite, few contexts preserve any record of this practice outside of architecture and pottery. The Painted Biclinium, then, serves to provide a colorful flourish to our understanding of this religious tradition in the cultivated rich semi-arid landscape around Petra.\n\nAccess\nLike Petra, Little Petra is open to the public during the daytime. It is, however, operated separately, and does not require an admission ticket and fee as Petra does. The local Bedouins sell souvenirs and snacks in the small parking lot, which also serves Beidha. Bedouin herders sometimes take their stock into the site to water at the cisterns.\nMany visitors to Petra have increasingly been including Little Petra on their itineraries. Guidebooks recommend it as less crowded and more relaxed than Petra itself. The Painted House, which has no counterpart at Petra, has also added to the attraction.\nIt is also possible to hike via the 6-kilometre (3.7 mi) trail from the end of the canyon to Ad-Deyr at Petra. Those who make the journey are advised to do so with a guide as the trail, while obvious in many places, is not formally marked. Hikers are also cautioned against attempting the trail alone, or late in the day, as nights in the region are often cold. It is also forbidden to enter Petra without having paid the larger site's admission.\n\nSee also\nList of World Heritage Sites in the Arab States\nMada'in Saleh, a Nabataean city in Saudi Arabia also inscribed as a World Heritage Site\nNegev incense route, ruins of four Nabataean cities in southern Israel, inscribed as a World Heritage Site\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Little Petra at Wikimedia Commons\nPhotos of Little Petra at the Manar al-Athar photo archive",

          "title": "Jerash",
          "content": "Jerash or Jarash (Arabic: جرش, romanized: Ǧaraš, Arabic pronunciation: [dʒa.raʃ]; Greek: Γέρασα, romanized: Gérasa, Attic Greek pronunciation: [ɡérasa], Koine Greek pronunciation: [ˈɡerasa]) is a city in northern Jordan. The city is the administrative center of the Jerash Governorate, and has a population of 50,745 as of 2015. It is located 30.0 miles (48.3 kms) north of the capital city Amman.\nThe earliest evidence of settlement in Jerash is in a Neolithic site known as Tal Abu Sowan, where rare human remains dating to around 7500 BC were uncovered. Jerash flourished during the Greek, Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine periods, when it was known as Gerasa. It was one of the cities of the Hellenistic cities of the Decapolis. It was an important city in early Christian times and its early churches, some of which were formerly temples, include notable examples of the evolution of church architecture. In the mid-eighth century the 749 Galilee earthquake destroyed large parts of it, and subsequent earthquakes contributed to additional destruction.\nIn 1120, Zahir ad-Din Toghtekin, atabeg of Damascus ordered a garrison of forty men to build up a fort in an unknown site of the ruins of the ancient city, likely the highest spot of the city walls in the north-eastern hills. It was captured in 1121 by Baldwin II, King of Jerusalem, and utterly destroyed. The Crusaders immediately abandoned Jerash and withdrew to Sakib (Seecip); the eastern border of the settlement.\nJerash was then deserted and reappeared in the historical record at the beginning of Ottoman rule in the area during the early 16th century. In the census of 1596, it had a population of 12 Muslim households. However, archaeologists found a small Mamluk hamlet in the Northwest Quarter which indicates that Jerash was resettled before the Ottoman era. The excavations conducted since 2011 have shed light on the Middle Islamic period as recent discoveries have uncovered a large concentration of Middle Islamic/Mamluk structures and pottery. The ancient city has been gradually revealed through a series of excavations since 1925.\nJerash today is home to one of the best preserved Greco-Roman cities, which earned it the nickname \"Pompeii of the Middle East\". Approximately 330,000 visitors arrived in Jerash in 2018, making it one of the most visited sites in Jordan. The city hosts the Jerash Festival, one of the leading cultural events in the Middle East that attracts tens of thousands of visitors every year.\n\nHistory\nNeolithic age\nArchaeologists have found ruins of settlements dating back to the Neolithic Age. Moreover, in August 2015, an archaeological excavation team from the University of Jordan unearthed two human skulls that date back to the Neolithic period (7500–5500 BC) at a site in Jerash. This forms solid evidence of inhabitance of Jordan in that period, especially in connection with the existence of 'Ain Ghazal Neolithic settlement in Amman. The importance of the discovery lies in the rarity of the skulls, as archaeologists estimate that a maximum of 12 sites across the world contain similar human remains.\n\nBronze Age\nEvidence of settlements dating to the Bronze Age (3200–1200 BC) have been found in the region.\n\nHellenistic period\nJerash is the site of the ruins of the Greek city of Gerasa, also referred to as Antioch on the Golden River. Ancient Greek inscriptions from the city support that the city was founded by Alexander the Great and his general Perdiccas, who allegedly settled aged Macedonian soldiers there during the spring of 331 BC, when he left Egypt and crossed Syria en route to Mesopotamia. However, other sources, namely the city's former name of \"Antioch on the Chrysorrhoas,\" point to a founding by Seleucid King Antioch IV, while still others attribute the founding to Ptolemy II of Egypt.\nIn the early 80s BC Hasmonean King Alexander Jannaeus besieged and conquered Gerasa, incorporating it into the Kingdom of Judea. Archeological findings indicate that public buildings in Gerasa may have been destroyed during that period.\n\nRoman period\nWith the Roman conquest of the area in 63 BC, the short-lived Jewish rule of Gerasa came to an end. Pompey attached the city to the Decapolis, a league of Hellenistic cities that enjoyed considerable autonomy under Roman protection. The historian Josephus mentions the city as being principally inhabited by Syrians, and also having a small Jewish community. During the First Jewish–Roman War, Gerasa was among the few non-Jewish cities in the region not to kill or imprison its Jewish residents, and its residents even escorted any Jews who wanted to leave to the border. \nGerasa was the birthplace of the mathematician Nicomachus of Gerasa (Greek: Νικόμαχος) (c. 60 – c. 120 AD). It has been proposed to identify it as Geresh, a place mentioned by Josephus as the birthplace of Jewish Zealot leader Simon bar Giora, but other scholars identify it with modern-day Jurish.\nIn the second half of the 1st century AD, the city of Gerasa achieved great prosperity. In AD 106, Geras was absorbed into the Roman province of Arabia, which included the cities of Philadelphia (modern day Amman), Petra and Bostra. The Romans ensured security and peace in this area, which enabled its people to devote their efforts and time to economic development and encouraged civic building activity. Emperor Trajan constructed roads throughout the province, and more trade came to Jerash. Emperor Hadrian visited Gerasa in AD 129–130, and the triumphal arch known as the Arch of Hadrian was built to celebrate this occasion.\n\nByzantine period\nThe city finally reached a size of about 80 ha (200 acres) within its walls. Beneath the foundations of a Byzantine church built in Gerasa in AD 530  a mosaic floor was discovered with ancient Greek and Hebrew-Aramaic inscriptions. The presence of the Hebrew-Aramaic script has led scholars to suggest that the place was a synagogue converted into a church. Gerasa was invaded by the Persian Sassanids in AD 614. In 636, the Byzantine army was defeated in the Battle of the Yarmuk by the invading Muslim forces and these territories became part of the Rashidun Caliphate.\n\nUmayyad period\nThe city flourished during the Umayyad Caliphate. It had numerous shops and issued coins with the mint named \"Jerash\" in Arabic. It was also a centre for ceramic manufacture; molded ceramic lamps had Arabic inscriptions that showed the potter's name and Jerash as the place of manufacture. The large mosque and several churches that continued to be used as places of worship, indicated that during the Umayyad period Jerash had a sizable Muslim community that co-existed with the Christians. In 749, a devastating earthquake destroyed much of Jerash and its surroundings.\n\nCrusader period\nIn the early 12th century a fortress was built by a garrison stationed in the area by the Zahir ad-Din Toghtekin, atabeg of Damascus. Baldwin II, King of Jerusalem, captured and burned the fortress in 1121–1122. Although the site of the fortification has often been identified with the ruins of the temple of Artemis, there is no evidence of the construction of a fortification in the temple in the 12th century. The location of this fort is probably to be found at the highest point of the city walls, in the north-eastern hills.\n\nMid to Late Muslim period\nSmall settlements continued in Jerash during the Mamluk Sultanate, and Ottoman periods. This occurred particularly in the Northwest Quarter and around the Temple of Zeus, where several Islamic Mamluk domestic structures have now been excavated.\nIn 1596, during the Ottoman era, Jerash was noted in the  census as Jaras, being located  in the nahiya of Bani Ilwan in the liwa of  Ajloun. It had a population of 12 Muslim households.  They paid a fixed tax-rate of 25%  on various  agricultural products, including wheat, barley, olive trees/fruit trees, goats and beehives, in addition to  occasional revenues and a press for olive oil/grape syrup; a total of  6,000 akçe.\nIn 1838 Jerash was described as a ruin.\n\nClimate\nJerash has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa).\n\nArchaeology\nJerash is considered one of the largest and most well-preserved sites of Greek and Roman architecture in the world outside Italy.\n\nGreco-Roman period\nRemains in the Greco-Roman Gerasa include:\n\nOval forum 300 feet long surrounded by an Ionic colonnade\nTwo large sanctuaries dedicated to Artemis and Zeus with well preserved temples\nTwo theatres (the South Theatre and the North Theatre)\nThe long colonnaded street or cardo and its side streets or decumani\nTwo tetrapyla of Jerash, one at the intersection of northern-decumanus and cardo maximus and the other at the intersection of southern-Decumanus and cardo maximus\nArch of Hadrian\nThe circus / hippodrome\nTwo major thermae (communal baths complexes)\nA large nymphaeum fed by an aqueduct\nA macellum or porticoed market\nA trapezoidal plaza delimited by two open-exedra buildings\nAn almost complete circuit of city walls\nTwo large bridges across the nearby river\nAn extramural sanctuary with large pools and a small theatre.\nMost of these monuments were built by donations of the city's wealthy citizens. The south theatre has a focus in the center of the pit in front of the stage, marked by a distinct stone, and from which normal speaking can be heard easily throughout the auditorium. In 2018, at least 14 marble sculptures were discovered in the excavation of the Eastern Baths of Gerasa, including images of Aphrodite and Zeus.\n\nLate Roman and Early Byzantine period\nA large Christian community lived in Jerash. A large cathedral was built in the city in the 4th century, the first of at least 14 churches built between the 4th and the 7th-century, many with superb mosaic floors. The supposed sawmill of Gerasa is well described in the Visitors Centre. The use of water power to saw wood or stone is well known in the Roman world: the invention occurred in the 3rd century BC. They converted the rotary movement from the mill into a linear motion using a crankshaft; good examples are known also from Hierapolis and Ephesus.\n\nArchaeological museums\nThe archaeological site of Jerash has two museums in which are displayed archaeological materials and corresponding information about the site and its rich history. The Jerash Archaeological Museum, which is the older of the two museums, is found on top of the mound known as \"Camp Hill\" just east of the Cardo and overlooking the Oval Plaza. The small museum contains a chronological display of artifacts found in and around Jerash from prehistoric to Islamic times. The museum displays a unique group of small statues of a group identified as the Muses of the Olympic pantheon which were discovered at Jerash in 2016. The statues, which are Roman in date, were found in a fragmentary condition and have been partially restored. The museum also contains a well-preserved lead sarcophagus dated to the late 4th to 5th centuries and features Christian and pagan symbolism. The museum also has a number of sculptures, altars, and mosaics displayed outside. \n\nThe Jerash Visitor Center serves as a more recent archaeological museum, and presents the site of Jerash in a thematic approach with a focus on the evolution and development of the city of Jerash over time, as well as economy, technology, religion, and daily life. The center also displays further sculptures discovered in Jerash in 2016, including restored statues of Zeus and Aphrodite, as well as a marble head thought to represent the Roman Empress Julia Domna.\n\nModern Jerash\nJerash has developed dramatically in the last century with the growing importance of the tourism industry in the city. Jerash is now the second-most popular tourist attraction in Jordan, closely behind the ruins of Petra. On the western side of the city, which contained most of the representative buildings, the ruins have been carefully preserved and spared from encroachment, with the modern city sprawling to the east of the river which once divided ancient Jerash in two.\n\nDemographics\nJerash has an ethnically diverse population. The vast majority are Arabs, though the population includes small numbers of Kurds, Circassians and Armenians. \nJerash became a destination for many successive waves of foreign migrants. In 1885, the Ottoman authorities directed the Circassian immigrants who were mainly of peasant stock to settle in Jerash, and distributed arable land among them. The new immigrants have been welcomed by the local people. Later, Jerash also witnessed waves of Palestinian refugees who flowed to the region in 1948 and 1967. The Palestinian refugees settled in two camps; Souf camp near the town of Souf and Gaza (Jerash) camp at Al Ḩaddādah village.\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 3,796 inhabitants in Jerash, of whom 270 were Christians.\nAccording to the Jordan national census of 2004, the population of the city was 31,650 and was ranked as the 14th largest municipality in Jordan. According to the last national census in 2015, the population of the city was 50,745, while the population of the governorate was 237,059.\n\nCulture and entertainment\nSince 1981, the old city of Jerash has hosted the Jerash Festival of Culture and Arts, a three-week-long summer program of dance, music, and theatrical performances.\nPerformances of the Roman Army and Chariot Experience (RACE) at the hippodrome in Jerash feature forty-five legionaries in full armor in a display of Roman army drill and battle tactics, ten gladiators fighting \"to the death\" and several Roman chariots competing in a classical seven-lap race around the ancient hippodrome.\n\nEducation\nJerash has two universities: Jerash Private University and Philadelphia University.\n\nTourism\nThe number of tourists who visited the ancient city of Jerash reached 214,000 during 2005. The number of non-Jordanian tourists was 182,000 last year, and the sum of entry charges reached JD900,000. The Jerash Festival of Culture and Arts is an annual celebration of Arabic and international culture during the summer months. Jerash is located 48 km north of the capital city of Amman. The festival site is located within the ancient ruins of Jerash, some of which date to the Roman age (63 BC). The Jerash Festival is a festival which features poetry recitals, theatrical performances, concerts and other forms of art. In 2008, authorities launched the Jordan Festival, a nationwide theme-oriented event under which the Jerash Festival became a component. However, the government revived the Jerash Festival as the \"substitute (Jordan Festival) proved to be not up to the message intended from the festival.\"\n\nGallery\nSee also\nExorcism of the Gerasene demoniac\nJerash Cathedral\nScythopolis (Beth-Shean)\nTemple of Artemis, Jerash\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBrown, J., E.

          "summary": "Jerash or Jarash (Arabic: جرش, romanized: Ǧaraš, Arabic pronunciation: [dʒa.raʃ]; Greek: Γέρασα, romanized: Gérasa, Attic Greek pronunciation: [ɡérasa], Koine Greek pronunciation: [ˈɡerasa]) is a city in northern Jordan. The city is the administrative center of the Jerash Governorate, and has a population of 50,745 as of 2015. It is located 30.0 miles (48.3 kms) north of the capital city Amman.\nThe earliest evidence of settlement in Jerash is in a Neolithic site known as Tal Abu Sowan, where rare human remains dating to around 7500 BC were uncovered. Jerash flourished during the Greek, Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine periods, when it was known as Gerasa. It was one of the cities of the Hellenistic cities of the Decapolis. It was an important city in early Christian times and its early churches, some of which were formerly temples, include notable examples of the evolution of church architecture. In the mid-eighth century the 749 Galilee earthquake destroyed large parts of it, and subsequent earthquakes contributed to additional destruction.\nIn 1120, Zahir ad-Din Toghtekin, atabeg of Damascus ordered a garrison of forty men to build up a fort in an unknown site of the ruins of the ancient city, likely the highest spot of the city walls in the north-eastern hills. It was captured in 1121 by Baldwin II, King of Jerusalem, and utterly destroyed. The Crusaders immediately abandoned Jerash and withdrew to Sakib (Seecip); the eastern border of the settlement.\nJerash was then deserted and reappeared in the historical record at the beginning of Ottoman rule in the area during the early 16th century. In the census of 1596, it had a population of 12 Muslim households. However, archaeologists found a small Mamluk hamlet in the Northwest Quarter which indicates that Jerash was resettled before the Ottoman era. The excavations conducted since 2011 have shed light on the Middle Islamic period as recent discoveries have uncovered a large concentration of Middle Islamic/Mamluk structures and pottery. The ancient city has been gradually revealed through a series of excavations since 1925.\nJerash today is home to one of the best preserved Greco-Roman cities, which earned it the nickname \"Pompeii of the Middle East\". Approximately 330,000 visitors arrived in Jerash in 2018, making it one of the most visited sites in Jordan. The city hosts the Jerash Festival, one of the leading cultural events in the Middle East that attracts tens of thousands of visitors every year.",

          "content": "Umm Qais (Arabic: أم قيس, lit. 'Mother of Qais'), also known as Qays, is a town in northern Jordan principally known for its proximity to the ruins of the ancient Gadara. It is the largest city in the Bani Kinanah Department and Irbid Governorate in the extreme northwest of the country, near Jordan's borders with Israel and Syria.  Today, the site is divided into three main areas: the archaeological site (Gadara), the traditional village (Umm Qais), and the modern town of Umm Qais.\n\nLocation\nUmm Qais is located 28 km north of Irbid and 120 km north of Amman. It expanded from the ruins of ancient Gadara, which are located on a ridge 378 metres (1,240 ft) above sea level, overlooking the Sea of Tiberias, the Golan Heights, and the Yarmouk River gorge. Strategically central and located close to multiple water sources, Umm Qais has historically attracted a high level of interest.\n\nHistory\nAntiquity\nGadara was a centre of Greek culture in the region during the Hellenistic and Roman periods.\nThe oldest archaeological evidence at Umm Qais, extends back to the second half of the third century BC. and the site appears to have been founded as a military colony by Alexander the Great's Macedonian Greeks. However, the site's name \"Gadara\" is not Greek in origin, but rather a Greek version of a local Semitic name meaning \"fortifications\" or \"the fortified city\" suggesting the military colony was founded on a pre-existing fortified site.\nLocated on the boundary between Seleucid and Ptolemaic territory, the city was strategically important and was repeatedly the focus of military conquests throughout the succession of Syrian Wars between 274–188 BCE. The city's military importance during this period was noted by the Greek historian Polybius' describing it in 218 BCE as a fortress and \"the strongest of all places in the region\".\nThe Roman-Seleucid War (192–188 BCE) weakened Seleucid control over the region devolving autonomy in Palestine and trans-Jordan to the Hasmonean, Iturean and Nabatean kingdoms whose rivalries continued to make Gadara a strategically important city and the focus of continued conflict.\nIn 98 BCE the Hasmonean King Alexander Jannaeus subjected the city to a 10 month siege, wresting control of the city and the trade routes to the ports of the Eastern Mediterranean that passed through it from the Nabateans. The Nabatean response culminated in Nabatean King Obdas 1st' decisive victory over Jannaeus at the Battle of Gadara in 93 BCE.\nIn 63 BCE, Roman general Pompey conquered the region, Gadara was rebuilt and became a member of the semi-autonomous Roman Decapolis. 33 years later Augustus attached it to the Jewish kingdom of his ally, Herod. After King Herod's death in 4 BCE, Gadara became part of the Roman province of Syria.\nTo supply larger populations Gadara, and the neighbouring Decapolis cities of Adraa (Dera'a, Syria) and Abila (Qweilbeh, Jordan) undertook construction of a water supply system of 170 km of aqueduct tunnels connecting the cities to springs throughout southern Syria and an artificially constructed lake at Dille. Constructed between 90–210 CE the network of rock cut tunnels included 2,900 access shafts, and a single 106 km section represents one of the most significant hydro-engineering accomplishments of the ancient world.\nDuring the Severan period (193–235 CE) the city underwent a rapid expansion westwards and many of the large civic monuments still visible on the site today date to this period and attest to an increase in importance and prosperity. After the Christianisation of the Eastern Roman Empire, Gadara retained its important regional status and became for many years the seat of a Christian bishop.\n\nEarly Islamic period\nThe Battle of Yarmouk in 636 CE a short distance from Gadara, brought the entire region under Arab-Muslim rule.\nOn 18 January 749 CE much of the city was destroyed by the Galilee earthquake. Whilst the city was extensively damaged, archaeological evidence of limited reconstruction, including conversion of the large five aisle basilica church into a mosque indicates the continued settlement of the site at least into the 11th Century.\nBy the 13th Century the site is noted in historic sources under the new name of \"Mukais\" a local term meaning border place or customs house and from which the modern name of Umm Qais gradual derived.\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1596 it appeared in the Ottoman tax registers named as Mkeis, situated in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Bani Kinana, part of the Hauran Sanjak. It had 21 households and 15 bachelors; all Muslim, in addition to 3 Christian households. The villagers paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on agricultural products; including wheat, barley, summer crops, fruit trees, goats and bee-hives. The total tax was 8,500 akçe.\nIn 1806 Ulrich Jasper Seetzen visited Umm Qais and identified it as the location of ancient Gadara, describing the Ottoman settlement and the tombs and other monuments still visible on the surface. The ancient ruins at Um Keis were recorded again by western visitors in 1816 and 1838. By 1899 Schumacher, visiting the site as part of his survey work for the Hijaz railway records the village had expanded significantly with the construction of larger houses, noting also that many of the tombs recorded by early visitors were no longer present. Umm Qais's most impressive building, the Ottoman governor's residence known as Beit Rousan, \"Rousan House\", dates to this period of expansion in the Late Ottoman period.\n\nModern period\nIn 1920 the Madafa and Hosh (courtyard) of Hajj Mahmoud al Rousan's house in Umm Qais hosted a conference of Arab leaders from across the middle east to draw up a treaty in response to the British and French plan to divide the region following the end of the British and French Mandates.\nThe village's school was opened in 1922 by HRH King Abdullah I of Jordan making it the third oldest school in Jordan after those in Salt and Kerak.\nBy 1961 the population of Umm Qais was 1,196 inhabitants.\nDuring the 1967 Arab-Israeli war Umm Qais' strategic location put it on the front line of conflict again. Heavy shelling from the Golan Heights and aircraft bombing damaged both the village and the ancient city. The underground Roman mausoleum below the five-aisled basilica in the west of the ancient was discovered by accident by the Jordanian army and the large intact underground chamber was used as a temporary field hospital during the conflict.\n\nPreservation efforts\nIn 1974 the German Protestant Institute of Archaeology uncovered the ruins of a Byzantine church building in Umm Qais.\nSince 2005, the Orient Department of the German Archaeological Institute under the direction of Claudia Bührig has been active at Gadara. The team has uncovered Egyptian and Greek imported pottery, stamped amphorae, and a Seleucid fortress, among other things.\nIn 2015, the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation and Yarmouk University collaborated to better preserve the Roman Aqueduct of Gadara in Umm Qais. This project was completed in 2018, strengthening the largest remaining subterranean Roman aqueduct.\n\nTourism\nMany visitors come to Umm Qais on day trips from the capital, Amman, roughly 110 kilometres (68 mi) to the north, to see its extensive ruins and enjoy its panoramic views. The Sea of Galilee and Tiberias, Israel, are visible, and just across the valley of the Yarmouk River is the southern end of the Golan Heights, Syria, under Israeli occupation since the Six-Day War in 1967. Mount Hermon bordering Lebanon is visible in the distance on clear days.\nAt Beit Rousan, now housing a visitor Centre and a museum, Greek statues and Christian mosaics discovered during archaeological excavations of ancient Gadara are exhibited.\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nGCatholic - (titular) bishopric\nIrbid Guide (in Arabic)\nGreater Irbid Municipality (in Arabic)\nIrbid news (in Arabic)\nHistory and pictures\nGreco-Roman & Decapolis city of Gadara \nPhotos of Umm Qais at the American Center of Research",

          "content": "Umm el-Jimal (Arabic: ام الجمال, \"Mother of Camels\"), also rendered as Umm ej Jemāl, Umm al-Jimal or Umm idj-Djimal, is a village in northern Jordan approximately 17 kilometers east of Mafraq. It is primarily notable for the substantial ruins of a Byzantine and early Islamic town which are clearly visible above the ground, as well as an older Roman village (locally referred to as al-Herri) located to the southwest of the Byzantine ruins.\n\nOverview\nUmm el-Jimal is a large village located in northern Jordan less than 10 km (6.2 mi) from the Syrian border. It is located in the Hauran, the northern desert region of the country. Despite this aridity, Umm el-Jimal is surprisingly well suited for agriculture, and its livelihood and economy is largely derived from agricultural and pastoral sustenance. The ruins of an ancient village lie in the midst of modern Umm el-Jimal. The ruins date from the Nabataean through the Abbasid periods. The earthquake circa 749 did major damage, but the community survived well into the Abbasid period. In the early 20th century the area was repopulated by the Druze and then the Bedouin Msa'eid tribe.\n\nHistory\nThe village of Umm el-Jimal originated in the 1st century CE as a rural suburb of the ancient Nabataean capital of Bostra. A number of Greek and Nabataean inscriptions found on the site date the village to this time. During the first century, the population of the site is estimated at 2,000–3,000 people. Upon the foundation of Provincia Arabia in 106, the Romans took over the village as Emperor Trajan incorporated the surrounding lands into the empire. In the village, the Romans erected a number of buildings including the Praetorium and the large reservoir near the castellum. After the Rebellion of Queen Zenobia in 275, Roman countermeasures included the construction of a fort (Tetrarchic castellum) that housed a military garrison. As Roman influence in the area gradually diminished, the area once again became a rural village. During the 5th and 6th centuries, Umm el-Jimal prospered as a farming and trading town in which the population jumped to an estimated 4,000–6,000 people. However, after the Muslim conquests of the 7th century, the village population diminished even though building projects and renovations continued to take place. In circa 749, an earthquake destroyed much of the area and Umm el-Jimal was abandoned like other towns and villages. The village remained uninhabited for nearly eleven hundred years until the modern community developed in the twentieth century.\n\nPrehistory\nLittle is known of pre-historical times in Umm el-Jimal, aside from the few scattered remains of what appear to be settlements of nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes. In some of these places it is possible to find chert knapping stones and some prehistoric tools. In the nearby wadis the remains of kites, which are large animal traps, have been found. The prehistoric people would have used these to catch large groups of animals at once.\n\nNabataean\nThe Nabataean peoples were the first to build permanent homesteads in the area in the first century AD. The settlement was mainly a farming community and a trading outpost dependent on Bostra, the nearby capital of the Nabataeans. Though the evidence for this village survives only in fragments, there are numerous Nabataean inscriptions from this period, mostly tomb stones. At least two men mentioned on these served as members of the Bostra City Council.\n\nEarly Roman\nAs the Romans continued their conquest of the surrounding areas, the Nabataean king saw his state's demise as inevitable, so he ceded his kingdom to the Roman emperor Trajan in AD 106. The Romans named the newly acquired territory Provincia Arabia and promptly set up local governments. The Praetorium, so named by H. C. Butler in 1905, may have been built for this purpose in the third century AD.\n\nLate Roman\nEverything changed after the rebellion led by Queen Zenobia of Palmyra in 275. The local people were no longer allowed to govern themselves, but had to submit to harsh foreign rule. Due to its location on the fringe of the Empire, Umm el-Jimal became a military outpost complete with a garrison and a new Tetrarchic-era fort. As Roman imperial power began to diminish, this earlier castellum lost its military function, and Umm el-Jimal gradually transformed from a military station to a civilian town. Paradoxically, from the point of view of the local Arab residents of the Hauran, this change may have been viewed as liberation rather than decline.\n\nByzantine\nThe Roman provincial administrators were replaced by Byzantine rulers in the 5th century. One of the rulers, Dux Pelagius, built smaller military quarters. These quarters were the later castellum, which is now known as the Barracks. As the local population gradually converted to Christianity the town reemerged as a prosperous agricultural and trading community. The 150 houses still standing today were constructed in this period, the fifth and sixth centuries. In the sixth century there was an explosion of church construction, 15 of which can still be seen today. The population continued to grow, reaching an estimated 6,000 inhabitants. In the seventh century, however, power of the region was ceded to the Islamic Umayyad Empire.\n\nUmayyad\nThe Islamic era at Umm el-Jimal began in 640 when the Rashidun Caliphs took control of the area. Much remodeling was done throughout the site so as to repurpose buildings to suit their own needs. The Praetorium and House XVIII are examples of buildings repurposed as dwelling places, while House 53 was possibly repurposed into a mosque. Despite all of this, the population decreased and the site was slowly abandoned with the help of an earthquake in circa 749 that destroyed many buildings and set much of the architecture off balance. The site was completely deserted under the Abbasid Caliphs in the ninth century.\n\nArab Revolt\nT. E. Lawrence wrote of \"ruined Um el Jemal\", \"There seemed evidence of bluntness of mind in these Roman frontier cities, Um el Jemal, Um el Surab, Umtaiye. Such incongruous buildings, in what was then and now a desert cockpit, accused their builders of insensitiveness; almost of a vulgar assertion of man's right (Roman right) to live unchanged in all his estate.\"\n\nReligion\nNabataean\nThere are a number of altars to Nabataean gods located on the site of Petra, including Dushara Aarra. Dushara, a god of Petra, is linked to Aarra, the patron god of Bostra, who become a unique regional deity. Both the Nabataean and Greek versions of his name can be seen inscribed on the die (middle section) of an altar, found in the western area of the ruins. Another god present at the site is Zeus Epikoos, a mixture of Zeus and the local deity Epikoos. In this case an altar was found in a courtyard, representative of a regional god. The altar found at Umm el-Jimal suggests personal devotion by a local resident to this deity. The third deity found at Umm el-Jimal is Solmos, who is not known elsewhere and may also be a local deity, perhaps only worshipped by the people of Umm el-Jimal and the immediate surrounding area. His name is found only once, on an altar inscription in the main ruins of Umm el-Jimal. Because this is the only known evidence of the worship of Solmos, it is reasonable to believe his worshipers were relatively few and localized. There is evidence on tombstones and small altars scattered throughout the site that suggests the worship of other deities, perhaps personal or familial gods not worshiped communally.\n\nEarly Roman Pagan\nDue to the tolerant nature of the early Roman occupation, little was contested during this period. The people of the region were able to continue their religious practices they had followed prior to the Roman occupation. Thus, it is likely that many of the regional gods like Zeus Epikoos and Solmos were still worshiped as the local deities.\n\nLate Roman\nAfter the rebellion of Palmyra most of the regional religious practices stopped altogether. This was due to harsh restrictions that were implemented by the Roman government to ensure that the people would not rise up again. There is evidence however, that a small Roman shrine surviving in House 49 may have served the garrison that was stationed in the Tetrarchic castellum.\n\nChristianity/Byzantium\nThe Byzantine Empire is representative of the Christianization of the Roman Empire by Constantine in the early fourth century AD. The change in religious affiliation influenced even the far reaches of the Empire, and is therefore evident here in Umm el-Jimal. Christian symbols can be found throughout the site carved into stone and by the architectural influences. The doctrinal shift in clergy-laity (parishioner) relations is represented by the addition of altar screens in the front of the churches and narthexes to their entries. Besides Christianity's influence through the construction of multiple churches on the site, some complexes may have had monastic use. The later castellum (Barracks) was converted into a monastery by the addition of a chapel to the main building. The towers, which were also added, are inscribed with the names of the four archangels and other Christian inscriptions. The inscriptions give the impression that these successful residents relied for protection more directly on God, to whom they felt close, rather than on an emperor who seemed so far away.\n\nIslam\nUmayyad Umm el-Jimal appears to have been part Christian and part Muslim with the two religious groups coexisting under the policy of the Dhimma. Scholars debate the idea that some of the churches in Umm el-Jimal were converted into mosques. In these former churches, the apse was blocked off and the focus of the structure's space was shifted south towards Mecca. Whether this is the case or not, it is more evident that two houses were converted to mosques with typically Umayyad plans and a small tower on the exterior of its west face indicating the presence of a minaret. The predominant Muslim modern community is served by several newly constructed mosques outside the antiquities.\n\nLocation\nThe village of Umm el-Jimal is located in the semi-arid region of Jordan known as the Southern Hauran, at the western edge of the desert Badiya region. The area consists mainly of the igneous rock basalt, which was used as the primary building material. Basalt also served as a natural insulation which was extremely important in the area. In the cool winter months the basalt blocks would trap the heat from the sun and then radiate that heat throughout the structure, thus acting as a natural heating source. In the hot summer months it would serve as a cooling unit because the dense nature of the blocks trapped the cool air within the structure, despite the fact that temperatures exceed 100 °F. The volcanic nature of the soil has made it one of the most fertile areas in Jordan and Syria.\n\nDemographics\nThe estimated population during the Nabataean period is unknown, because evidence of a residential community was obliterated by the later construction phases. However, because the town was likely a major trading post along the same route as Bostra, the population could have been several thousand strong. Numerous Nabataean and Greek tombstones testify to their presence. Based on the number of structures, the peak population was likely in the sixth century perhaps 3,000–7,000 people. In the Byzantine and Umayyad periods houses were occupied by both people and pastoral animals. In the Umayyad period a smaller number survived at Umm el-Jimal. While some buildings were not occupied, it was still a prosperous place and some new farmstead-type houses were constructed with characteristic Umayyad mangers. By 900, the town was abandoned. It is unknown as to why, but it was most likely due to the same reasons that the greater population of the wider region of Syria decreased; i.e., plague, drought, earthquakes, etc. Aside from these basic numbers, the general range of poor to wealthy households is largely unknown for most of the different eras of occupation. The location of the site suggests that it was rather small, but the number of buildings and churches suggest otherwise.\n\nArchaeology\nUmm el-Jimal was rediscovered in the nineteenth century, during a time of Western interest in antiquities. The first systematic survey was completed by the Princeton University Expedition to Southern Syria in 1905 and 1909. \nThe first recorded visit to the site was by William John Bankes (1786–1855) in 1818 who conducted a brief description of Umm el-Jimal. Between 1818 and 1905, many Westerners passed through the site and made a few recordings but all were brief and inconclusive. \nHoward Crosby Butler led the Princeton Expedition and his papers (PES II: 151) contain a more exhaustive account of those who came to Umm el-Jimal between 1818 and 1905. Butler remained at the site for two weeks mapping the site and drawing diagrams of several of the buildings. Butler's work has proved invaluable in guiding others to the site and in garnering further interest in studying the site. His survey of 1905 provided the groundwork for the field work still being conducted today.\nG. Corbett came to Umm el-Jimal in 1956 to study the Julianos Church and much of his work corrected the mistakes made by Butler. Corbett also refined how Umm el-Jimal is thought of today by demonstrating that many of the buildings were constructed reusing pieces from earlier buildings. In 1972 comprehensive work was started at Umm el-Jimal by Bert de Vries of Calvin College. The ancient village was further mapped out and detailed work conducted refining the theories surrounding the nature and history of the village. The work has included conservation practices. In 1977, the walls of the Barracks were fortified with cement to prevent more collapse. The gate area of House XVIII was also fortified in 1983 with modern cement. Excavations were conducted during field work between 1972 and 1998, though the nature of the excavations was for survey and research and not for uncovering buried ruins. Since 1998 the work has centered on presentation and visual documentation of the site. Started in 2009, efforts are currently being conducted to make the site more presentable to the public. A significant component of this effort is the development of a virtual museum with site tours, a compilation of the research and publications, and presentation of the heritage of the modern community and its relationship to the antiquities.\nIn 2014, extensive damage was done to the site by tomb raiders. Sparked by rumors of gold, looters have destroyed many tombs. \"The looters are looking not only for gold but for ceramics, glassware, lamps, masonry and bits of jewelry, all of which quickly find their way into the global antiquities trade.\"\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\nA request for UNESCO world heritage status was submitted in 2022. In July 2024, Umm el-Jimal was admitted during the 46th session held in India.\n\nSee also\nKhirbet es-Samra\nList of World Heritage Sites in Jordan\nTourism in Jordan\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n\nEnno Littmann, David Magie Jr. and Duane Reed Stuart, Greek and Latin Inscriptions - The Umm el-Jimal Project.

          "content": "Madaba (Arabic: مادبا; Biblical Hebrew: מֵידְבָא‎ Mēḏəḇāʾ; Ancient Greek: Μήδαβα) is the capital city of Madaba Governorate in central Jordan, with a population of about 60,000. It is best known for its Byzantine and Umayyad mosaics, especially a large Byzantine-era mosaic map of the Holy Land. Madaba is located 30 kilometres (19 miles) south-west of the capital Amman.\n\nHistory\nBronze Age\nMadaba dates from the Middle Bronze Age.\n\nIron Age\nThe town of Madaba was once a Moabite border city, mentioned in the Bible in Numbers 21:30 and Joshua 13:9. Control over the city changed back and forth between Israel and Moab, as mentioned in the Mesha Stele.\n\nClassical Antiquity\nDuring its rule by the Roman and Byzantine empires from the 2nd to the 7th centuries, the city formed part of the province of Arabia Petraea set up by the Roman Emperor Trajan to replace the Nabataean kingdom of Petra.\nThe first evidence for a Christian community in the city, with its own bishop, is found in the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon in 451, where Constantine, Metropolitan Archbishop of Bostra (the provincial capital) signed on behalf of Gaiano, \"Bishop of the Medabeni.\" It was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate in 629 after the Battle of Mut'ah.\nDuring the rule of the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate, it was part of the southern district of Jund Filastin within the Bilad al-Sham province.\n\nModern settlement\nIn 1880, 90 Arab Christian families from Al Karak resettled the ruins of Madaba, led by two Italian priests from the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The Christian families had petitioned the Turkish government to be allowed to resettle Madaba, by then just large tell after tensions arose with Muslim families in Al Karak. The government also gave the permission for the rebuilding of churches on the sites of ancient churches from antiquity. In 1884, it was the clearance of debris from one such site that led to the uncovering of the 6th-century Madaba Map mosaic.\nThe Catholic Church's list of titular sees uses the spelling \"Medaba\", in reference to the ancient bishopric located in this city, while referring to the modern city as \"Madaba\".\nToday, the city is the seat of Madaba Governorate and is the 9th-biggest city in Jordan, with a population of 122,008 as of 2021.\n\nArchaeological finds\nIn Madaba city\nThe first mosaics were discovered during the building of new houses using bricks from older buildings. The new inhabitants of Madaba, made conscious of the importance of the mosaics by their priests, made sure that they took care of and preserved all the mosaics that came to light.\nThe northern part of the city turned out to be the area containing the greatest concentration of mosaics. During the Byzantine-Umayyad period, this northern area, crossed by a colonnaded Roman road, saw the building of the Church of the Map, the Hippolytus Mansion, the Church of the Virgin Mary, the Church of Prophet Elijah with its crypt, the Church of the Holy Martyrs (Al-Khadir), the Burnt Palace, the Church of the Sunna' family, and the church of the salaita family.\n\nThe Madaba Map mosaic was discovered in 1884 during the construction of the church of St. George, but was only properly investigated more than a decade later in 1896 after it was witnessed by Father Kleopas Koikyides, the librarian of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem. In 1897, he published a reliable sketch and his findings on the relic in a commentary in Greek entitled: The Geographical Madaba Mosaic Map on Syria, Palestine and Egypt.\nThe Madaba Map dates from the 6th century and is preserved in the floor of the modern Greek Orthodox Basilica of Saint George, sometimes also called the \"Church of the Map\". With two million pieces of coloured stone, the map depicts hills and valleys, villages and towns in Palestine and the Nile Delta. The mosaic contains the earliest extant representation of Byzantine Jerusalem, labeled the \"Holy City.\" The map provides important details about its 6th-century landmarks, with the cardo, or central colonnaded street, and the church of the Holy Sepulchre clearly visible. This map is one key in developing scholarly knowledge about the physical layout of Jerusalem after its destruction and rebuilding in 70 AD.\nOther mosaic masterpieces found in the Church of the Virgin and the Apostles and the Archaeological Museum, depict a profusion of flowers and plants, birds and fish, animals and exotic beasts, as well as scenes from mythology and everyday pursuits of hunting, fishing and farming. Hundreds of other mosaics from the 5th through the 7th centuries are scattered throughout Madaba.\nThe University of Toronto has been excavating in Madaba from 1996 until the present. Their efforts have focused primarily on the west acropolis where an open field has allowed access to uncover the entire sequence of occupation at Madaba from the modern period down to the Early Bronze Age levels. The most visible feature of this area is a 7.5-meter-wide (25 ft) fortification wall built sometime in the 9th century BC, with subsequent rebuilds throughout its history. There is also the remains of a well-preserved Byzantine-era house at the base of the fortification wall.\nIn 2010, a 3,000-year-old Iron Age temple containing several figurines of ancient deities and circular clay vessels used in Moabite religious rituals was discovered at Khirbat 'Ataroz near Mabada.\n\nIn Khirbat Ataruz\nKhirbat Ataruz, also known as Ataroth, is mentioned prominently in the Mesha stele and its ruins are located in Madaba Governorate, outside of Madaba city. It was conquered by Israelite King Omri, as discussed in the Mesha stele, Book of Numbers 32, and 2nd Books of Kings 3:4–27. The oldest inscription in the Moabite language script, dated to the late 9th or early 8th century BC, was found at Khirbat Ataruz.\n\nMadaba Institute for Mosaic Art and Restoration\nThe Institute of Mosaic Art and Restoration was founded in 1992 as the Madaba Mosaic School, and funded by the Italian government. It was a high school which offered the Tawjihi, the Jordanian equivalent of a high school diploma. In 2007, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, under the Department of Antiquities, partnered with USAID's Siyaha tourism development project, and the Italian government to launch the institute as a two-year, post-secondary educational program. The institute offers diplomas in Mosaic Art Production and Restoration. The institute is located between the Madaba Visitors Center and the Madaba Archaeological Park.\n\nClimate\nMadaba has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa). Most rain falls in the winter. The average annual temperature in Madaba is 16.4 °C (61.5 °F). About 346 mm (13.62 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nPoints of interest\nMadaba's main attraction is its Byzantine mosaics, drawing many visitors, especially since the creation of an archaeological park. They cover the floors of houses and churches dating from the site's earliest period of habitation.\nSouthwest of Madaba is Hammamat Ma'in (Ma'in Hot Springs), thermal mineral springs that for centuries have attracted people for its purported therapeutic properties.\nThe nearby site of Umm ar-Rasas, south-east of Madaba on the edge of the semi-arid steppe, started as a Roman military camp and grew to become a town from the 5th century. It also has very large and well-preserved mosaics.\nAt the southern entrance to Madaba, near the King's Highway, is the Church of the Apostles. The ruins of this Byzantine church date to 578 CE, and are currently being restored. It includes a mosaic known as the \"Personification of the Sea\", depicting a woman emerging from the sea, surrounded by mythical aquatic creatures and a hodgepodge of rams, bulls, parrots and exotic vegetation. The mosaic was signed by a mosaicist named Salamanios.\n\nA weaving project started by twelve women of the Bani Hamida tribe in 1985 produces woven items in traditionally bright colors. Traditional ground looms, assembled using stones and sticks, are used for the weaving, and the products can be found at numerous outlets in Jordan and abroad. Visitors can stop by the weaving rooms, located in the village of Mukawir, to see how the rugs are made. The women also make decorative candles.\nThe American University of Madaba opened in 2011, and is located on a 100-acre campus outside the city.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns – sister cities\nMadaba is twinned with:\n\n Bethlehem, Palestine\n Denton, Texas\n\nSee also\nEarly Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East\nIsaiah 15\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nRantzow, George Louis Albert, de (German name Georg Ludwig Albrecht von Rantzau, often named Jørgen Ludvig Albert de Rantzow).

          "content": "مادبا او مادبا مدينه تقع في وسط المملكه الاردنيّه الهاشميّه، وهي مركز محافظه مادبا. تبعد 33 كيلومترًا جنوب غرب العاصمه عمّان، وترتفع عن مستوى سطح البحر بحوالي 770 مترًا. بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2015 حوالي 105,353 نسمه، حيث تُعتبر تاسع اكبر مدينه في المملكه.\nاسس المؤابيّون المدينه في القرن الثالث عشر قبل الميلاد، حيث كانت جزءًا من مملكتهم الممتده شرق نهر الاردن. كما توالى عليها العديد من الحضارات التي حكمت المنطقه. كما لعبت دورًا بارزًا بعد ان احتلها البيزنطيّون، اذ ضمّت عددًا من الكنائس التاريخيّه الهامّه. وتعد المدينه اليوم، من اكثر الاماكن اهميّهً لاتباع الديانه المسيحيّه، بسبب وجود تلك المعالم الدينيّه. كما يقع في محيطها الكثير من المواقع الاثريّه والاماكن المقدسه المتمثّله بمواقع الحج المسيحي مثل المغطس، جبل نيبو، مكاور وام الرصاص، مما يجعل منها مقصدًا للسيّاح. علمًا بان اهميه مادبا في القرون الاولى للمسيحيه كانت مثل اهميه مدينه القدس كاهم مركز للحياه المسيحيه في شرق الاردن، حيث ذُكرت في الانجيل، الا انها تعرضت للدمار نتيجه للزلزال العنيف الذي لحق بالمنطقه عام 749، وزلازل اخرى تلته. ولكن القبائل العربيه المسيحيه من منطقه الكرك اعادت احياءها واستوطنتها ابتداءً من عام 1880 م، حيث يسكنها اليوم المسيحيون والمسلمون على حد سواء.\nاشتهرت مادبا كثيرًا بالفسيفساء، وهي واحده من اهم المدن الحرفيّه في العالم بهذا الفن، حيث تشتهر المدينه بارث خاص في ازقتها وكنائسها البيزنطيّه القديمه ومساجدها وعمارتها الفريده. كما تحوي المعهد الوحيد في العالم لتعليم هذا الفن، حتى سُميت بمدينه الفسيفساء. وتُعد خارطه مادبا من اهم الاثار الفسيسفائيه في المدينه.\nتاسس اول مجلس بلدي للمدينه في عام 1912، وهو اليوم تحت اسم بلديه مادبا الكبرى، التي تقع ضمن حدودها خمسه مناطق، تكوّن حدود مدينه مادبا الممتده على حوالي 54 كيلومترًا مربعًا. وقد اُعلن عن فوز المدينه بلقب عاصمه السياحه العربيّه لعام 2022، بعد تحقيقها للمعايير والشروط المرجعيّه كافه.\n\nالتسميه\nلم يتغير اسم مادبا عبر المراحل التاريخيّه المختلفه، الا بشكل طفيف في اللفظ، مما يعطي دلاله واضحه ومهمه على تاريخ المدينه. كما يلفظ اهل المنطقه اسم المدينه بالف ممدوده دون همزه، وهو الاسم الذي اصبح متعارفًا عليه في المنطقه.\nيعود اصل تسميه مدينه مادبا الى عده احتمالات (يُطلق عليها باليونانيه: Μαντάμπα)، فهناك احتمال ان الكلمه سريانيه، وتعني «مكان الطين» او «المياه الهادئه»، لان المياه تستقر عاده حول المدينه. ويوجد احتمال اخر هو ان الاسم ارامي، حيث تتكون مادبا من كلمتين؛ هما «ميا» د «ايب»، فالكلمه الاولى تعني المياه والثانيه تعني الفاكهه، وحرف الدال للاضافه فيكون معناه مياه الفاكهه. كما يوجد احتمال ثالث، وهو ان مادبا كانت بالاصل «ميدبا»، وهو اسم مؤابي يعني مياه الراحه، وانه ربما كان ماخوذًا من كثره عدد برك المياه التي كانت تحيط بالمدينه.\nكما ذُكرت في الانجيل بهذا الاسم، والتي تُعد من اقدم المدن المؤابيه. وقد بقي كما هو في جميع المصادر القديمه التي ذكره دون تحريف، حتى العصر الحديث.\n\nالتاريخ\nالتاريخ القديم\nورد اسم مادبا وجوارها في العديد من الكتابات التاريخيّه القديمه، والكتب السماويه، كالتوراه والانجيل والاسفار. وجاء فيها اسم «ميداب» و«حشبون» (حسبان) و«ذيبون» (ذيبان) وجبل نيبو و«بعل معون» (ماعين) ومكاور ووادي الواله، وغيرها من المواقع المهمّه، اضافه الى النقوش والشواهد الاثريّه العديده، والتي يُستدل منها ان المدينه كانت احدى المدن العامره في الازمان القديمه، وان لها تاريخًا يعود الى حضاره المؤابيين وعده ممالك اخرى حكمتها.\n\nظهر في بدايات القرن الثالث عشر قبل الميلاد في منطقه شرق الاردن عده ممالك ودويلات كانت ذات طابع محلي، هي ممالك المؤابيين والعمّونيين والادوميين والاموريين. وكانت مادبا ضمن اراضي مملكه مؤاب، التي امتدت اراضيها في وادي الموجب شمالاً الى الحسا جنوبًا. الا ان حدود تلك الممالك لم تكن ثابته، بل كانت تتغير وتتبدل بين الفتره والاخرى، وذلك تبعًا لطبيعه الاحوال السياسيّه السائده في هذه الممالك. وهذا يعني ان منطقه مادبا وجوارها قد تبادلت السيطره عليها في بعض الاحيان دول غير المؤابيين، كالاموريين والعمّونيين. وكانت تلك الفتره نفسها التي خرج منها بنو اسرائيل من مصر في فتره النبي موسى، الذين وقعت بينهم وبين المؤابيين عده معارك، تمكن بعدها الملك العبري عمري الانتصار والسيطره على عده مناطق مؤابيه، كانت منها مادبا. ولكن تبعيه مملكه مؤاب للملك عمري لم تدم طويلا، حيث انتصر عليه الملك ميشع، وتمكن من استعاده قوه مؤاب وطرد بني اسرائيل منها. ولقد خلّدت مسله ميشع تلك الانتصارات.\nلقد لعب موقع مادبا تاريخيًا دور كبير في اهميتها، حيث كانت احدى محطات طريق الملوك الذي يربط مصر ببلاد الشام، حيث يُعتبر احد اقدم واهم الطرق التجاريه في منطقه الشرق الاوسط. كما اعتمد المؤابيون وغيرهم من الاقوام في الدول القديمه على هذا الطريق للتجاره. كانت السيطره على هذا الطريق من اهم اسباب المعارك التي حدثت بين بني اسرائيل والممالك الواقعه شرق نهر الاردن. وقد ورد في الكتاب المقدس بعهده القديم عندما زحفت جيوش حلف مؤلف من اربعه من ملوك الشمال على طول هذا الطريق لمحاربه الملوك مدن بسهل الخمس بما في ذلك مدينتا سدوم وعموره، وهو الطريق الذي تمنى موسى ان يسلكه مع قومه عبر ارض ادوم للحصول على ارض كنعان.\nخضعت مادبا بعد فتره للسيطره الاراميه، ثم احتلها الاشوريون، الذين اعطوا الحكم للمؤابيين ليحكموا انفسهم بانفسهم مقابل اعطاء الجزيه. وعندما تغلب البابليون على الاشوريين، سيطروا على جميع مناطقهم، ومنها مؤاب. وقد قام القائد نبوخذنصر بالهجوم على حسبان وذبح اهلها، وذلك بعد هجومه على القدس والسبي البابلي الاول. وقد تراجعت مؤاب بعد ذلك.\nخضعت المنطقه بعد ذلك للغزو الفارسي، ثم احتلها الاسكندر المقدوني عام 332 ق.م، فادخل الى المنطقه بعض مظاهر الحضاره اليونانيه. استمر هذا الامر حتى دخول الانباط المدينه في القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد، حيث تمكن الملك الحارث الاول من استرجاع مادبا وجوارها وضمها لمملكته. واسند الانباط اداره مادبا وجوارها الى بني يعمر.\n\nالرومان والبيزنطيون\nخضعت مادبا لسيطره الرومان في بدايه القرن الثاني، واصبحت ضمن المقاطعه العربيه البترائيه. لقد جعل الرومان مادبا مدينه نموذجيّه بامتياز، فبنوا الشوارع المعمّده، والمعابد، ومباني اخرى. كما اقاموا احواض ماء ضخمه وسوراً يحصنها. لقد تم الحفاظ على جزء من شوارع مدينه مادبا الرومانيّه في منتزه مادبا الاثري، حيث يقطع الشارع الروماني القديم، وهو من ابرز عناصر المتنزه، المدينه من الشرق الى الغرب، ويقود الى بوابات اسوارها القديمه، ويمتد مدفونا تحت الارض لمسافه طويله خارج المنتزه. كما اعاد الرومان انشاء طريق الملوك الي يمر بمادبا، وتحديدًا في فتره الامبراطور تراجان. وقد اُطلق عليه اسم \"Via Traiana Nova\"، كما تم اكماله في فتره الامبراطور هادريان. لقد تم استخدام الطريق فيما بعد من قبل الحجاج المسيحيين القادمين الى فلسطين والاردن، لكونه يمر من عده اماكن مسيحيه مهمه، بما فيها جبل نيبو، والمغطس على نهر الاردن.\nلقد ازدهرت مادبا في الفتره البيزنطيّه، خاصهً بعد انتشار المسيحيّه في المنطقه، حيث اعتنقها احد الزعماء العرب من قبائل الضجاعمه، وتاصّلت فيها ايام الغساسنه سنه 292 م. وكانت مادبا ومكاور وحسبان من اهم المقاطعات العربيّه في تلك الفتره. كما اصبحت المدينه بعد ذلك احدى مدن المقاطعه الثالثه في عهد ثيودوسيس الفلسطيني. وقد عُين لمادبا اسقف اسمه قايوناس الثاني في حوالي سنه 451 م. كما وُجدت العديد من الاثار الكنسيّه ابان تلك الفتره. ومن اهم هذه الكنائس كنيسه الخارطه. ولعل انتشار بناء الكنائس في مادبا في هذه الفتره اعطي دلاله مهمه تدل ان سكانها كانوا باعداد كبيره، ساعد ذلك في الرخاء الاقتصادي في مادبا.\nاشتهرت مادبا كثيرًا بالفسيفساء، حتى سُميت بمدينه الفسيفساء. ومن اهم الاثار الفسيسفائيه في المدينه خارطه مادبا. وهي جزء من ارضيه فسيفسائيه لكنيسه قديمه. وهي اقدم خريطه اصليه للاراضي المقدسه، والتي يعود انشاؤها الى سنه 560. توجد اليوم داخل كنيسه القديس جوارجيوس في مدينه مادبا، والتي بُنيت في عام 1896 فوق بقايا الكنيسه البيزنطيه. تمتد خريطه مادبا على جزء من ارضيه الكنيسه، وتُقدر ابعادها بنحو 15.75 عرضا 5.60 طولا، وتشكل مدينه القدس مركزا لها. وتظهر فيها مواقع في فلسطين والاردن وسوريا ولبنان ومصر.\n\nالحكم الاسلامي\nلقد تمكّن المسلمون من فتح مادبا بعد الفتح الاسلامي للشام عام 637 م، ولم يُجبر احد على تغيير دينه، حيث استمر الكثير من سكان المدينه باعتنقاء المسيحيه. وقد مرّ الخليفه عمر بن الخطاب بمادبا في طريقه لفتح القدس، كما تم بناء مسجد المدينه في المنطقه التي صلى فيها، وهي منطقه الخطابيه التي سُميت باسمه فيما بعد. كما تم بناء العديد من الكنائس في بدايه الحكم الاسلامي للمنطقه، وتحديدًا في فتره الدوله الامويّه.\nلقد ساهم ابناء مادبا ايضًا في تزيين القصور الصحراويّه التابعه للخلفاء الامويين، كقصر عمره وقصر هشام في اريحا، كما ان معظم الانتاج الفسيفسائي جرى في تلك الفتره، كما في كنيسه مريم العذراء، وغيرها. الاّ ان المدينه تعرضت لعده كوارث طبيعيه كالزلازل، الحقت بها اضرارًا كبيره، كان اكبرها زلزال عام 749 م، والذي ادى الى دمار كبير بالمدينه، ومدن اخرى في فلسطين والاردن.\nلقد اكسب موقع مادبا الاستراتيجي والقريب من طريق الحج الشامي اهميه خاصه لدى المماليك، فقد كانت من اشهر المحطات في العصر المملوكي في منطقه البلقاء، وقريبه من المحطات الاخرى في حسبان، ذيبان، وزيزيا. الاّ ان اهميتها قد فُقدت لصالح جارتها حسبان لسنوات عديده. حيث تم الحاق اراضي مادبا بالاخيره حتى القرن التاسع عشر، حتى عادت الى مكانتها.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nظلّت اهميّه المدينه متواضعه حتى قدوم بعض من العشائر المسيحيّه من الكرك ابتداءً من عام 1880، فاحيوها من جديد بعدما استوطنوها. كما شُيِّدت عدد من المباني الاداريّه بعد ذلك، كان اهمّها دار السرايا العثمانيّه المبنيّه في عام 1896. كما شُيِّد عدد من المباني الدينيّه من الكنائس والمساجد في تلك الفتره وما بعدها في مواقع اثريّه هامّه، فتم بناء كنيسه قطع راس يوحنا المعمدان (دير اللاتين) في سنه 1883، وكنيسه القديس جاورجيوس سنه 1896، في حين بُنِي مسجد الملك حسين في 2007، تلى ذلك نمو في السكان بشكل متسارع حول دور العباده تلك.\nكانت مادبا وجوارها تتبع لقضاء السلط الواقع ضمن متصرفيّه الكرك سنه 1872. وقد شهدت المنطقه تغيرات اداريّه مستمرّه، حيث انشات الدوله العثمانيّه اول ناحيه في الجيزه، ثم ناحيه الثمد، وقد انتقل مركز هذه الناحيه فيما بعد الى مادبا، واستقر الامر نهائيًا على انشاء ثلاث نواحٍ في المنطقه هي: ناحيه الجيزه وناحيه عمّان وناحيه مادبا. كما تاسّس اول مجلس بلدي بالمدينه عام 1912. لقد تطورت مادبا بعد استقلال الاردن عام 1946 كغيرها من المدن الاردنيه تطورًا لافتًا في اكثر من صعيد. وعلى المستوى الاداري والتنظيمي، تحوّلت من قضاء الى لواء الى ان اصبحت اخيرًا بمستوى مركز لاحدى محافظات الاردن الاثنتي عشره، يتبع اليها لواء ذيبان وعدد من الاقضيه.\nتجدر الاشاره الى ان المدينه تضم عدّه متاحف تحكي تاريخها، منها متحف مادبا الاثري ومتحف الحكايه التراثي في جبل نيبو ومنتزه مادبا الاثري. وقد زار منطقه مادبا ثلاثه من البابوات، حجوّا الى موقع مغطس المسيح، وهم البابا جون بول الثاني، حيث زار المنطقه في اذار/ مارس 2000. بعد ذلك البابا بنديكتوس السادس عشر في ايار/ مايو 2009، عندما اسس لبناء الكنيسه اللاتينيّه اليونانيّه الملكيين الجديده. اما ثالث زياره، فكانت من قبل البابا فرنسيس في ايار/ مايو 2014.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقعُ مدينه مادبا على مسافه 33 كيلومترًا جنوبَ العاصمه الاردنيّه عمّان، على دائره العرض 31ْ شمالاً، وخط الطول 35ْ شرقاً. وتصلُ مساحه المدينه الى حوالي 54 كيلومتراً مُربَّعاً. تتكون مدينه مادبا من خمسه مناطق تشرف عليها بلديّه مادبا الكبرى وتقع ضمن حدودها؛ هي منطقه جرينه والوسيه، منطقه غرناطه والعريش، منطقه ماعين والمنشيه، منطقه الفيصليه، ومنطقه المريجمات والحويه. ومن ناحيه اداريه، تعتبر المدينه مركز قضاء مادبا وكذلك محافظه مادبا، التي تُعَدّ واحدهً من محافظات الاردن الاثني عشر.\nتحدٌّ المدينه من جهه الشمال الشرقي عمَّان، حيث يمكن الوصول منها الى مادبا عبر محورين؛ الاول عبر طريق مادبا الشرقي (طريق 35) الذي يخترق المدينه من جهه مطار الملكه علياء الدولي في الشرق، متجهًا الى الجنوب. اما المحور الثاني، فهو طريق مادبا الغربي، الذي يربط المدينه بالعاصمه عبر ناعور. اما من الجنوب، فيحد المدينه محافظه الكرك، وتشرف على البحر الميت من جهه الغرب. كما يمكن الوصول الى مادبا عبر طرق ثانويه من المناطق المحيطه بها، كطريق ام الرصاص جنوبًا، وطريق ماعين من الجنوب الغربي، وطريق جبل نيبو من الشمال الغربي. وتتموضعُ المدينه - جغرافيًا - في منطقه هضاب البلقاء، وبذلك فانَّها تتبعُ اقليم حوض البحر الابيض المتوسط، حيث تبعد عنها القدس 53 كيلومترًا الى الغرب، بينما تبعد عنها دمشق 200 كيلومترًا الى الشمال.\nتقعُ المدينه على سهلٍ زراعي خصب في ربوه طبيعيه، حيثُ لا زالت تشغلُ نفس الموقع الذي استوطنه الناسُ فيها منذ العصور القديمه. كما تمتاز المنطقه عمومًا بتنوع تضاريسها، حيث تشتهر بسهولها الواسعه المنبسطه، والتي تعمل على رفد المملكه بكميات وافره من الحبوب، اضافه الى مناطقها الغوريه والشفا غوريه، والتي تعتبر من اهم مصادر انتاج الخضراوات والفواكه والزيتون.\n\nالتضاريس\nيرتفع سطح منطقه مادبا ارتفاعًا تدريجيًا نحو الغرب، حتى يشرف على وادي الاردن والبحر الميت، وذلك بانحدار شديد، وفي المقابل ينحدر سطح الارض ببطء شديد بالاتجاه شرقًا، حتى يكاد ان يتلاشى الانحدار عند نهايه حدوده الشرقيه. وبذلك تشكل مادبا هضبه متموجه السطح. وتتميز تضاريس مادبا بالتعقد باتجاه الغرب، بينما تنساب سهولها بالاتجاه نحو الشرق، تتخللها بعض التلال والمرتفعات المتفرقه، والتي لا يزيد ارتفاعها عن 900 متر فوق مستوى سطح البحر.\n\nالمناخ\nتمتازُ مدينه مادبا بمناخٍ شبه رطب يميلُ للجفاف. وتسودُ فيها الرِّياح الغربيه عامَّه، والرِّياح الشماليه الغربيه خصوصاً. وتمتازُ، مثل باقي الاردن، برياحٍ بارده وجافَّه شتاءً، ومعتدله ورطبه صيفاً. وقد تهبّ احياناً على المدينه رياحٌ شرقيه او شماليه شرقيه، قد تحملُ معها عواصف رمليَّه مُحمَّله بذرَّات الغُبَار. ويبغُ متوسِّط سرعه الرياح 15 كيلومتراً/الساعه، وقد يصلُ - باحيانٍ مُعيَّنه - الى 120 كم/ساعه.\nتتفاوتُ معدَّلات الامطار في مدينه مادبا على مدار السَّنه وخلال الفصول بدرجهٍ كبيره، وذلك نظراً الى تاثير المنخفضات الجويَّه على الطَّقسِ فيها. وبصورهٍ عامه يمتدّ موسم الامطار من شهر تشرين الاول/ اكتوبر الى ايار/ مايو، ويبلغ معدل الهطول فيه حوالي 100 ملم او اكثر، وهي تقعُ في نطاقٍ شبه رطب. وتتراوحُ الرطوبه - بالمثل - على مدار العام، وما بين اللَّيل والنَّهار، وذلك تاثراً بنوع الكتل الهوائيه ودرجات الحراره. ويبلغُ وسطيّ الرطوبه النسبيه في لمديه وجوارها 58%، الا انَّه قد ينخفضُ في اوقاتٍ من العام (بين شهري مارس وابريل) الى 5% فحسب، فيما يترفعُ باوقاتٍ اخرى (في شهر نوفمبر) الى حدِّ 79%.\n\nالسكان\nحسب احصاء سُكَّان الاردن لسنه 2015، يبلغ عدد سُكَّان مدينه مادبا 105,353 نسمه، حيث بلغت النسبه الذكور من بينهم حوالي 53% والاناث 47%، واما عددُ الاسر فقد زادَ عن واحدٍ وعشرين الف اسره. وتعود جذور التركيبه السكانيّه لمدينه مادبا الى القرن التاسع عشر، اذ انَّ المدينه الحاليه تاسَّست خلال تلك الفتره، نتيجه هجره عددٍ كبيرٍ من العائلات المسيحيَّه من مدينه الكرك جنوباً واستقرارها في موقع مادبا المعاصر.\n\nفي ذلك الحين، كات الفئات المسيحيَّه تُمثِّل اغبيه سُكَّان المدينه، ففي عام 1919، بلغ سُكَّان مادبا حوالي 2,000 نسمه منهم 87% من معتنقي الديانه المسيحيه. الا انَّ عدد السكان المسيحيِّين تضاءل مع الوقتِ نتيجه قدوم الكثير من العائلات المسلمه الى مادبا واستقرارها فيها خلال القرن العشرين، كما انَّ نسبه تزايد السكان المسيحيِّين اقلُّ من اولئك المسلمين، وبالتالي فقد انخفضت نسبتهم مع الوقت. ففي احصاء سنه 1969 ارتفع عدد السكان الى 12,500 نسمه، الا انَّ نسبه المسيحيين منهم تدنَّت الى 40%. واما الان فقد اصبحت نسبتهم تُقدَّر بما بَيْن 10 الى 20% من اهالي مادبا فحسب، الذين تجاوز عددهم المائه الف نسمه.\nيشّكل اللاجئون جزءًا من سكان مادبا، اذ استقبلت المدينه اللاجئين من الدول القريبه على مر العقود الماضيه، حيث يوجد في الجزء الجنوبي منها مخيم مادبا للاجئين الفلسطينيين، والذي تاسس بعد نكبه فلسطين باعوام، وتحديدًا عام 1956، ويبلغ عدد سكانه 5500 نسمه حسب قيود وكاله الغوث الدوليّه. كما تستضيف المدينه والمناطق المجاوره منها الاف اللاجئين السوريين، يُقدر عددهم بحوالي 5000 لاجئ ومن الايدي العامله، اتوا الى مادبا بعد الازمه السوريه، بالاضافه الى مئات الاسر من اللاجئين العراقيين الذين ازدادت اعدادهم بعد احتلال العراق عام 2003.\n\nالاقتصاد\nيعتمد اقتصاد المدينه كثيرًا على ايرادات السياحه. فوجود العدد الكبير من الكنائس الاثريّه والمعالم المعماريّه التاريخيّه القريبه والمنتجعات الترفيهيه القريبه بالاضافه الى الاسواق والطرق التي تقع على جنباتها عشرات المحال من محترفي فن صناعه الفسيفساء ضمن مسار مادبا التراثي، جعلت من مدينه مادبا المدينه الحرفيه الاولى في العالم في فن الفسيفساء دون منازع. وقد بلغ عدد السيّاح الذين زاروا المواقع السياحيّه المختلفه في مادبا وجوارها خلال شهر كانون الثاني/ يناير 2016 حوالي 5411 سائحًا وفق مديريه سياحه مادبا.\nمن جهه اخرى، يعمل جزء كبير من سكان المدينه بالزراعه، حيث تشتهر المنطقه بسهولها الواسعه المنبسطه، والتي تعمل على رفد المملكه بكميات وافره من الحبوب، اضافه الى مناطقها الغوريه والشفا غوريه، والتي تعتبر من اهم مصادر انتاج الخضراوات والفواكه والزيتون. الا المدينه وجوارها تشهد نهضه عمرانيّه كبيره بسبب قربها من العاصمه وسهوله اراضيها، ويسر المواصلات الى عمّان، حيث تشابكت المباني وتوسعت على حساب الاراضي الزراعيه الخصبه التي تمتاز بها المحافظه.\n\nالتعليم\nتتواجدُ في مدينه مادبا 47 مدرسه للمراحل الدراسيه المختلفه، من اهمها كينغز اكاديمي، اضافهً الى 20 دار حضانه، كما انَّها تعتمدُ على المناطق والبلدات المحيطه بها في مراكز تدريبٍ لاختصاصاتٍ اخرى.\n\nكما يوجد في المدينه 13 مركزاً تعليمياً مُرخصاً من الحكومه، وتوفّر هذه المراكز دوراتٍ في مجالات الاعمال، والاداره، واستخدام الحاسوب. كما تقعُ فيها محطه مادبا المعرفيه، المُتخصِّصه بتوفير خدمات التدريب بمجال التقنيه.\nلم تكُن تتواجدُ في المدينه - حتى وقتٍ قريب - ايّ جامعهٍ او كليَّه للتعليم بعد المدرسي، وذلك حتى افتتاح الجامعه الامريكيه في مادبا عام 2011. تعتبر الجامعه الامريكيه في مادبا جامعهً خاصَّه، ولها كليات مُخصَّصه لمجالات الهندسه والصحه والعلوم وتقنيه المعلومات والفنون واداره الاعمال واللغات.\nيُشار بالذكر الى انه قد تم تاسيس الجامعه الالمانيه الاردنيه عام 2005 في منطقه المشقر المحيطه بمادبا، وتحديدًا على طريق مادبا الغربي، الذي يصل المدينه بكل من العاصمه عمّان وناعور.\n\nالثقافه\nعُرفت مادبا في خمسينيات وستينيات القرن العشرين باسم «موسكو الصغيره»، لكثره ما فيها من شيوعيين كانوا جزءاً من حراك سياسي وحزبي، شارك في تشكيله ايضًا، البعثيون والقوميون العرب. وفي مرحله متاخره نسبيًا، ظهرت الحركه الاسلاميه. كما كان لشخصيات ادبيّه من المدينه الدور الريادي في الحياه الثقافيّه والسياسيّه في المملكه حتى قبل تاسيس اماره شرق الاردن، حيث انجبت مدينه مادبا على مر تاريخها المعاصر العديد من الاعلام البارزين في المشهد الثقافي الاردني.\nتضم مادبا وجوارها عده مراكز ثقافيّه يصل عددها الى 18 مركزًا وهيئه تتبع لمديريه ثقافه مادبا وتعنى بالشان الثقافي كمؤسسات مجتمع محلي. كما تضم المدينه عده متاحف تحكي تاريخها، منها متحف مادبا الاثري ومتحف الحكايه التراثي في جبل نيبو ومنتزه مادبا الاثري، كما رُممت مباني البلده القديمه فيها بشكل جيد، حيث يتم عقد الفعاليات الثقافيه فيها.\nتشهد مادبا ازديادًا بالانشطه والمهرجانات المحليّه، وذلك منذ اعلانها عاصمه للثقافه الاردنيّه في عام 2012، وهو مشروع تنظمه وزاره الثقافه الاردنيّه بحيث يتم اختيار مدينه كل عام ليتم تركز النشاطات الثقافيه فيها. حيث اعلنت الوزراه بهذه المناسبه، عن افتتاح عدد من الصروح الثقافيّه، كما استضافت المدينه على مدار عام العديد من الفعاليات الادبيّه والفنيّه والندوات والمؤتمرات والعروض والامسيات الشعريه، بالاضافه الى اصدار الكتب واعداد مجموعه من الافلام الوثائقيه التي تبرز تاريخ المدينه وتراثها.\n\nالعماره\nتُعتبر مادبا من المدن التراثيّه المهمّه في الاردن. كما تُعتبر بلديه مادبا الكبرى من اوائل البلديّات في المملكه التي استحدثت قسمًا للتراث، وعيًا منها لاهميته وحفاظًا على هويه المكان. كما قامت بترميم العديد من المعالم القديمه، حيث قامت بترميم طريق تراثي متكامل تحت اسم مسار مادبا التراثي.\n\nكما يعكس تطور مادبا المعماري والمدني، الظروف التاريخيّه والدينيّه والاجتماعيّه الخاصه باعاده استيطان المدينه في اواخر القرن التاسع عشر، فكانت عماره المدينه اساسًا من المحتوى الاجتماعي لمكونيها من العائلات المسيحيه التي انتقلت من الكرك الى مادبا في تلك الفتره، والتي قامت ببناء المباني سواء المدنيّه منها او التجاريّه والحكوميّه، والتي لا تزال موجوده للان في منطقه وسط المدينه والتي تشبه لحد كبير تصاميم المباني الموجوده في باقي منطقه بلاد الشام. حيث تضم مدينه مادبا ومحيطها مجموعه كبيره من البيوت التراثيّه التي تجسد العماره التقليديّه للمجتمع الاردني (يبلغ عددها 25 بيتًا في المدينه وحدها، تحوّل بعضها الى متاحف ومطاعم وبازارات واستثمارات اخرى). وتمتاز تلك البيوت ذات انماط العماره التقليديه ببساطه البناء المتكيّف مع البيئه والمناخ، حيث شُيدت بمواد بناء متوافره محليًا، مثل الطين والقش والقصب، وذلك لحمايه السكان من برد الشتاء والحيوانات المفترسه. لقد كانت بيوت مادبا القديمه المبنيه على طراز القناطر، تضم جزء اساسي في تكوينها، وهو الحوش. وكان من مكونات بعض تلك البيوت الخارجيّه ما يشبه مصطبه مرتفعه كانت بمثابه مكان للسهر صيفًا. كما يوجد في اعلى البوابات فتحات للتهويه وللسماح بدخول اشعه الشمس وتمرير الهواء الى داخل الدار. كما يتميز البيت المادبي القديم، بتنوع الزخرفه وتصوير المواضيع الزخرفيه النباتيه والهندسيه، وبارتفاع الاسقف الحجريّه.\n\nالنسيج الحضري\nبالنسبه للتخطيط الحضري للمدينه وضواحيها، فقد اخذت مدينه مادبا الشكل الشريطي تماشيًا مع امتداد الطرق الرئيسه، بحيث لم يزد ارتفاع اعلى نقطه للمدينه عن 900 متر عن سطح البحر في منطقه التل. ولم يؤثر الوضع الطبوغرافي لمادبا على شكلها، بل نمت المدينه وتطورت في جميع الاتجاهات دون عوائق، وقد تضاعفت مساحه مادبا عبر تطورها التاريخي لمرات عده، منذ بدايه القرن العشرين في كافه الاتجاهات. ويعمل الزحف العمراني على تقليص المساحات الزراعيّه المتبقيه في مادبا وجوارها، حيث تشهد المدينه نهضه عمرانيّه كبيره بسبب قربها من العاصمه عمّان وسهوله اراضيها، ويسر المواصلات الى الاخيره، حيث تشابكت المباني وتوسّعت على حساب الاراضي الزراعيّه الخصبه التي تمتاز بها.\n\nابرز معالم المدينه\nالرياضه\nتُعتبر المدينه الرياضيه في مادبا، والواقعه في منطقه الهلاليّه جنوب مركز المدينه بحوالي 7 كيلومترات، نقطه جذب رياضي في المحافظه رغم تواضعها، حيث تستقبل المباريات الرسميّه التي تقيمها الاتحادات الرياضيّه المختلفه او من خلال التدريبات المستمره للانديه والهيئات الشبابيّه ومؤسسات المجتمع المدني في المحافظه منذ عام 1997. تضم المدينه الرياضيّه عده منشات رياضيّه، اهمها الصاله المتعدده الاغراض التي تتسع لحوالي 1,500 متفرج، والملعب الاولمبي لكره القدم الذي يتسع لحوالي 2,000 متفرج، والملاعب المكشوفه المُخصصه لكره اليد وكره القدم الخماسي والكره الطائره وكره السله، وتتسع مدرجاتها لحوالي 1,000 متفرج، بالاضافه الى المسابح وملاعب السكواش وملاعب الاطفال، وبيت الشباب.\nيُشار بالذكر الى ان المدينه وجوارها تضم عده انديه رياضيّه تشارك في دوري محافظه مادبا، منها نادي اتحاد مادبا، نادي الوحده الاردني، نادي مليح، ونادي حسبان. وتُصنف جميعها ضمن دوري الدرجه الثانيه الاردني فما دون.\n\nتوامه المدن\nفلسطين، بيت لحم \n فلسطين، العبيديه \n بلغاريا، تونجا \n الولايات المتحده، دينتون، تكساس\n\nانظر ايضًا\nمعرض

          "content": "Mount Nebo (Arabic: جَبَل نِيبُو, romanized: Jabal Nībū; Hebrew: הַר נְבוֹ‎, romanized: Har Nəḇō) is an elevated ridge located in Jordan, approximately 700 metres (2,300 ft) above sea level. Part of the Abarim mountain range, Mount Nebo is mentioned in the Bible as the place where Moses was granted a view of the Promised Land before his death. The view from the summit provides a panorama of the West Bank across the Jordan River valley. The city of Jericho is usually visible from the summit, as is Jerusalem on a very clear day. The biblical town of Nebo, now known as Khirbet al-Mukhayyat, is located 3.5 km (2.1 mi) away.\n\nReligious significance\nAccording to the Bible (Deuteronomy), Moses ascended Mount Nebo, in the land of Moab (today in Jordan), and from there he saw the Land of Canaan (the Promised Land), which God had said he would not enter; Moses then died there. The Bible (Deuteronomy 34:6) says Moses' burial place was unknown. A monument atop Mount Nebo commemorates Moses' death after seeing Canaan, across the Jordan valley. A purported grave of Moses is located at Maqam El-Nabi Musa, in the West Bank, 11 km (6.8 mi) south of Jericho and 20 km (12 mi) east of Jerusalem.\nMount Nebo is then mentioned again in 2 Maccabees (2:4–7), when the prophet Jeremiah hid the tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant in a cave there.\nA Christian church from Byzantine times stands on the top of Mount Nebo.\nOn March 20, 2000, Pope John Paul II visited the summit of Mount Nebo during his pilgrimage to the Holy Land. During his visit, he planted an olive tree next to the Byzantine chapel, as a symbol of peace. Pope Benedict XVI visited the site in 2009, gave a speech, and looked out from the top of the mountain in the direction of Jerusalem.\nA serpentine cross sculpture atop Mount Nebo was created by Italian artist Gian Paolo Fantoni. It is symbolic of the miracle of the bronze serpent invoked by Moses in the wilderness (Numbers 21:4–9) and the cross upon which Jesus was crucified (John 3:14).\n\nArchaeology\nSystematic exploration begun by Sylvester J. Saller O.F.M. was continued in 1933 by Jerome Mihaic of the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum. On the highest point of the mountain, Syagha, the remains of a Byzantine church and monastery were discovered in 1933. The church was first constructed in the second half of the 4th century to commemorate the place of Moses' death. The church design follows a typical basilica pattern. It was enlarged in the late fifth century AD and rebuilt in AD 597. The church is first mentioned in an account of a pilgrimage made by a lady Aetheria in AD 394. Six tombs have been found hollowed from the natural rock beneath the mosaic-covered floor of the church.\nBellarmino Bagatti worked on the site in 1935. Virgilio Canio Corbo later excavated the interior of the basilica.\n\nHistory of the modern Memorial of Moses\nThe ancient church, a pilgrimage destination since the 4th century, was excavated between 1933 and 1938 by Sylvester Saller, bringing to light the basilica with its chapels and the annexes of the monastery. The exquisite mosaics were then covered back with soil for protection. In 1963, the Custody of the Holy Land decided to restore the mosaic floors and Virgilio Corbo was put in charge of the project. A metal shelter designed in Oxford was erected over the ruins, but work was interrupted by the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Renewed work ensued between 1976-1984, when a new mosaic was discovered in the diaconicon-baptistery. By 1984 the consolidation work was completed, and as a result, the basilica could be used both for liturgical purposes, as well as for displaying the restored mosaics, either in situ or mounted on the walls. After renewed plans drawn in 1989 and geological surveys and assessments of the ancient and modern structures made a decade later, a new shelter, basically a complete basilica was built over the ancient church between December 2007 and the reopening day on 15 October 2016. Not even the sudden death of Michelle Piccirillo, a key figure in the project, in October 2008, led to a break in the work.\n\nExhibited mosaics\nIn the modern chapel presbytery, built to protect the site and provide worship space, remnants of mosaic floors from different periods can be seen. The earliest of these is a panel with a braided cross presently placed on the east end of the south wall.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nEarly Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East\nMount Nebo, Utah\nMount Pisgah (Bible)\nNabau\nNabi Musa\nMichele Piccirillo (archaeologist) (1944–2008), active at Mount Nebo and buried there\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nMount Nebo: New Archaeological Excavations: 1967–1997, Michele Piccirillo and Eugenio Alliata\n\nExternal links\n\nFranciscans at Mount Nebo\nArchaeology and Art – photographs of excavations in Jordan\nPictures from Mount Nebo 1\n\"Nebo, Mount\" .

          "content": "Al-Maghtas (Arabic: المغطس, romanized: al-Maghṭas, lit. 'the Baptism' or 'the Immersion'), officially known as Baptism Site \"Bethany Beyond the Jordan\", is an archaeological World Heritage Site in Jordan, on the east bank of the Jordan River, reputed to be the location of the Baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist and venerated as such since at least the Byzantine period. The place has also been referred to as Bethabara (Hebrew: בית עברה) and historically Bethany (בית עניה) or Bethany Beyond the Jordan (see below).\nAl-Maghtas includes two principal archaeological areas: the remnants of a monastery on a mound known as Jabal Mar-Elias (جبل مار إلياس, 'Elijah's Hill') and an area close to the river with remains of churches, baptism ponds and pilgrim and hermit dwellings. The two areas are connected by a stream called Wadi Kharrar (وادي خرار).\nThe strategic location between Jerusalem and the King's Highway is already evident from the Book of Joshua report about the Israelites crossing the Jordan there. Jabal Mar-Elias is traditionally identified as the site of the ascension of the prophet Elijah to heaven. The complete area was abandoned after the 1967 Six-Day War, when both banks of the Jordan became part of the frontline. The area was heavily mined then.\nAfter the signing of the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994, de-mining of the area soon took place at the initiative of Jordanian Prince Ghazi. The site has since then seen several archaeological digs, visits by three Popes (John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis) and by many heads of state, and attracts tourists and pilgrimage activity. In 2015, the site was designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, excluding the western side of the river. Approximately 81,000 people visited the site in 2016, mostly European, American, and Arab tourists. Thousands flock to the site on January 6 to mark Epiphany.\n\nNames\nBethany\nTwo passages from the Gospel of John indicate a place \"beyond the Jordan\" or \"across the Jordan\": \n\nJohn 1:28: These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptising. This is the only mention of this \"Bethany on the East bank of the Jordan\" in the New Testament.\nJohn 10:40: He [Jesus] went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing earlier, and he remained there.\n\"Bethany\" may come from bēṯ ‛ăniyāh (בית עניה), Hebrew for 'house of the poor/afflicted'. The name \"Bethany\" is shared with a different town located on the Mount of Olives, mentioned many times in the New Testament. Most English versions of the New Testament refer to \"Bethany on the east bank of the Jordan River\" (including the Douay-Rheims, NIV, NASB, NLT, RSV, IBS, and Darby).\n\nBethabara\nOrigen was a 3rd-century Christian scholar from the Roman Empire. Noticing that in his time there was no place called Bethany east of the Jordan, he suggested amending the name to Bethabara, an existing place at the time. His suggestion was picked up by some, and it was used in several translations, including the King James Version.\n\"Bethabara\" ( beth-AB-ər-ə; Hebrew: בית עברה, romanized: Bēṯ ‛Ăbārāh; Ancient Greek: Βηθαβαρά, romanized: Bēthabará; lit. 'House of the Ford'  or 'Place of Crossing') is the name used by some versions of the New Testament for the site \"beyond (i.e. east of) the Jordan\" where John the Baptist preached and performed baptisms, where he met with a group of priests and Levites sent by the Pharisees to investigate his ministry, and where he baptised Jesus (Yeshua) (John 1:28–29). The name \"Bethabara\" also appears on the 6th-century Madaba Map (though west of the Jordan River) and in the Talmud. The name is used in a number of versions, including the King James Version (following the Textus Receptus and in the Geneva Bible of the New Testament) the place where John the Baptist was baptizing in John 1:28 was not called Bethany, but Bethabara.\nIt follows the New York and Moscow uncials, corrected forms of Ephraemi and Athos, along with uncial fragments from St Petersburg, Paris, minuscule 1, and family 13, backed up by Eusebius, Cyril, some Byzantine texts and lectionaries, and the Curetonian Old Syriac, Aramaic Peshitta, Armenian, and Georgian manuscripts, among others, \". The reading Bethabara became current owing to the advocacy of both Origen (3rd century) and John Chrysostom (4th century), and that same Bethabara is attested in both the 6th-century Madaba Map and in the Jewish Talmud.\nG. A. Smith suggests in his \"Atlas of the Historical Geography of the Holy Land\" (HGHL; 1915) that Bethany ('House of the Ship') and Bethabara ('House of the Ford') are names for the same place. The second place may also refer to the more northerly territory of Batanaea.\n\nAl-Maghtas\nAl-Maghtas is the Arabic word for a site of immersion, and implicitly of baptism.\n\nGeography\nAl-Maghtas is located on the eastern bank of the Jordan River, 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) north of the Dead Sea and 10 km (6.2 mi) southeast of Jericho. The entire site, which is spread over an area of 533.7 hectares (5.337 km2; 1,319 acres), has two distinct zones – Tell al-Kharrar, also called Jabal Mar Elias (Elijah's Hill), and the area close to the river (2 km (1.2 mi) to the west), the Zor area, where the ancient Church of Saint John the Baptist is situated.\nThe site is close to the ancient road between Jerusalem and Transjordan, via Jericho, across a Jordan River ford and connecting to other biblical sites such as Madaba, Mount Nebo and the King's Highway.\nWhile the initial site of veneration was on the eastern side of the River Jordan, the focus had shifted to the western side by the 6th century. The term Al-Maghtas itself has been used historically for the area stretching over both banks of the river. The western part, also known under the name Qasr el-Yahud, has been mentioned in the UNESCO proposal, but so far has not been declared as a World Heritage Site.\nIn November 2015, the site became available on Google Street View.\n\nReligious significance\nIsraelites' crossing of the Jordan\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, Joshua instructed the Israelites how to cross the Jordan by following the priests who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant through the river, thus making its waters stop their flow (Joshua 3, mainly Joshua 3:14–17). Ancient traditions identified Al-Maghtas, known in antiquity as bet-'abarah or Bethabara, \"House of the Crossing\" (see Madaba Map), as the place where the people of Israel and later Prophet Elijah crossed the Jordan River and entered the Promised Land.\n\nProphet Elijah\nThe Hebrew Bible also described how Prophet Elijah, accompanied by Prophet Elisha, stopped the waters of the Jordan, crossing to the eastern side, and then went up by a whirlwind into the heavens. Elisha, now his heir, again separated the waters and crossed back (2 Kings 2:8–14). An ancient Jewish tradition identified the site of crossing with the same one used by Joshua, thus with Al-Maghtas, and the site of Elijah's ascension with Tell el-Kharrar, also known as Jabal Mar Elias, \"Hill of Prophet Elijah\".\n\nBaptism of Jesus\nJohn probably baptised in springs and brooks at least as much as he did in the more dangerous Jordan River. The concrete example is \"Aenon near Salim\" of John 3:23, where \"aenon\" stands for spring. At Al-Maghtas there is a short brook, Wadi al-Kharrar, which flows to the Jordan, and is associated with the baptism activities of John.\n\nHistoricity\nThe Washington Post states, \"There is no archaeological evidence of Jesus ever having been baptized in these waters\"; however, the Jordanian, eastern side of the traditional baptism area of Al-Maghtas has been accepted by various Christian denominations as the authentic site of the baptism of Jesus. ICOMOS in its consideration of \"Bethany Beyond the Jordan\" as a UNESCO World Heritage Site notes that sites historically associated with Jesus' baptism also exist on the west bank across the river as well and puts forth that their investigation into the Al-Maghtas site for recognition as a World Heritage Center does not prove without doubt that the archaeological structures there actually relate historically to Jesus' baptism and further notes that other sites along the Jordan River have historically made similar claims. The Baptism Site's official website shows 13 authentication testimonials from representatives of major international denominations.\n\nHistory and archaeology\nPre-Roman settlement\nThe archaeological excavations have unearthed antiquities which attest to the conclusion that this site was first settled by a small group of agriculturists during the Chalcolithic period, around 3500 BC. There are again signs of settlement from the Hellenistic period.\n\nRoman and Byzantine periods\nThe site contains buildings with both aspects of a Jewish mikveh (ritual bath) resembling Second Temple period pools from Qumran, and later of Christian use, with large pools for baptism, linking both customs.\nPossibly in the 2nd–3rd and certainly starting with the 5th–6th centuries, Christian religious structures were built at Tell al-Kharrar. It must be remembered that in the 1st-4th centuries of the Christian Era, Christianity was often persecuted by the Roman state, and only after it became first tolerated and then outright the state religion of the Roman, or now so-called Byzantine Empire, open Christian worship became possible.\nArchaeological excavations also established that the hill of Tell al-Kharrar, known as Elijah's Hill, was venerated as the spot from which Prophet Elijah ascended to heaven. In the 5th century, in commemoration, a Byzantine monastery was erected here. The archaeologists have named it the \"Monastery of Rhetorios\" after a name from a Byzantine mosaic inscription.\nThe Byzantine emperor Anastasius I Dicorus erected between 491 and 518 a first church dedicated to John the Baptist on the eastern banks of the River Jordan. However, due to two flood and earthquake events the church was destroyed. The church was reconstructed three times, until it crumbled, together with the chapel built over piers, during a major flood event in the 6th or 7th century.\nThe pilgrimage sites have shifted throughout history. The main Christian archaeological finds from the Byzantine and possibly even Roman period indicated that the initial venerated pilgrimage site was on the east bank, but by the beginning of the 6th century the focus had moved onto the more accessible west bank of the river.\nDuring the Byzantine period, the site was a popular pilgrimage centre. The Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem in 614, river floodings, earthquakes and the Muslim capture of Jerusalem in 637 put an end to Byzantine building activity on the east bank of the Jordan, particularly in the Wadi al-Kharrar area.\n\nEarly Muslim period\nThe Muslim conquest put an end to Byzantine building activity on the east bank of the Jordan River, but several of the Byzantine structures remained in use during the Early Islamic period. With time worship took place just across the river on the western side at Qasr el-Yahud. After 670 AD the commemoration of the baptism site moved to the western side.\n\nMamluk and Ottoman periods\nThe structures were rebuilt many times but were finally deserted by end of the 15th century.\nIn the 13th century an Orthodox monastery was built over remnants of an earlier Byzantine predecessor, but how long it lasted is not known. However, pilgrimage to the site declined and according to one pilgrim, the site was in ruins in 1484. From the 15th to the 19th century there were hardly any visits by pilgrims to the site. A small chapel dedicated to St. Mary of Egypt, a hermit from the Byzantine period, was built during the 19th century and was also destroyed in the 1927 earthquake.\nIn the early part of the twentieth century, a farming community had occupied the area east of the Jordan River.\n\nRediscovery after 1994 and tourism\nAs a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the river became the ceasefire line and both banks became militarised and inaccessible to pilgrims. After 1982, while Qasr el-Yahud was still off-limits, Israel enabled Christian baptisms at the Yardenit site further north. Following the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994 access to Al-Maghtas was restored after Prince Ghazi of Jordan, who is deeply interested in religious history, visited the area in the company of a Franciscan archaeologist who had convinced him to take a look at what was thought to be the baptism site. When they found evidence of Roman-period habitation, this was enough to encourage de-mining and further development. Soon afterwards, there were several archaeological digs led by Dr. Mohammad Waheeb who rediscovered the ancient site in 1997. The 1990s marked the period of archaeological excavations of the site followed by primary conservation and restoration measures during the early 21st century. Jordan fully reopened al-Maghtas in 2002. This was then followed by the Israeli-run western side, known as Qasr el-Yahud, which was opened for daily visits in 2011 – the traditional Epiphany celebrations had already been allowed to take place since 1985, but only at the specific Catholic and Orthodox dates and under military supervision. In 2007, a documentary film entitled The Baptism of Jesus Christ – Uncovering Bethany Beyond the Jordan was made about the site.\nThe western side attracts larger tourist interest than its Jordanian counterpart, with half a million visitors compared to some ten thousand on the Jordanian side. Other estimates put the numbers as 300,000 on the Israeli side and 100,000 on the Jordanian side. To put that into perspective, Yardenit has more than 400,000 visitors per year.\nIn the millennium year 2000, John Paul II was the first pope to visit the site. His two successors, popes Benedict XVI and Pope Francis, also visited the site, as have a number of heads of state and other dignitaries. In 2002, Christians commemorated the baptism of Christ at the site for the first time since its rediscovery. Since then, thousands of Christian pilgrims from around the world annually have marked Epiphany at Bethany Beyond the Jordan. Also in 2002, the Baptism Site opened for daily visits, attracting a constant influx of tourists and pilgrimage activity. In 2015, the UNESCO declared the Al-Maghtas site in Jordan, on the east bank of the River Jordan, as a World Heritage Site, while Qasr el-Yahud was left out.\nThe Museum of Jesus' Baptism is planned to be built at Al-Maghtas by 2030 as part of the Jordanian governments attempt to attract 1 million Christian tourists to the area.\n\nFeatures\nArchaeological excavations at the site of the 1990s have revealed religious edifices of the Roman and Byzantine periods which include \"churches and chapels, a monastery, caves used by hermits and pools\", which were venues of baptisms. The excavations have been supported by institutions from various countries, such as the US and Finland, and by the German Protestant Institute.\n\nTell el-Kharrar or Elijah's Hill and the baptismal pools\nThe digs unearthed three churches, three baptismal pools, a circular well and an external compound encircling the hill. The existence of water supply sourced from springs and conveyed to the baptism sites through ceramic pipes was revealed; this facility is available even now.\n\nBankside area (Zor)\nIn the Zor area of the site, the finds uncovered a church with a hall with columns, a basilica church known as the Church of St. John the Baptist, and the Lower Basilica Church with marble floors having geometrical designs. Also exposed were the Upper Basilica Church, the marble steps, the four piers of the Chapel of the Mantle, the Small Chapel, the Laura of St. Mary of Egypt, and a large pool. The stairway of marble steps was built in 570 AD. Twenty-two of the steps are made of black marble. The stairway leads to the Upper Basilica and a baptismal pool. This pool had once four piers that supported the Chapel of the Mantle.\n\nHermitages\nThe Quattara hills revealed a number of monk caves, also known as hermit cells, which are 300 metres (980 ft) away from the Jordan River. When the caves were in use access was through a rope way or by stairway or ladders from the western and south-western sides, but none of these are seen now. Each of these caves was carved with a semicircular niche on its eastern wall. Each cave has two chambers, one for prayer and another a living space for the monks.\n\nTombs\nTombs unearthed in and outside the churches are believed to be of monks of the churches. These tombs are of the Byzantine and early Islamic periods (5th–7th centuries). Numismatics finds of coins and ceramics at the site are epigraphic proofs of the site's history.\n\nUNESCO involvement\nIn 1994, UNESCO sponsored archaeological excavations in the area. Initially UNESCO had listed the site in the tentative list on 18 June 2001 and a new nomination was presented on 27 January 2014. ICOMOS evaluated the report presented by Jordan from 21 to 25 September 2014. The finds are closely associated with the commemoration of the baptism. Following this evaluation, the site was inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site under the title \"Bethany Beyond the Jordan (Al-Maghtas)\". It was inscribed as a cultural property under UNESCO Criteria (iii) and (vi). The Palestinian Tourist agency deplores the UNESCO's decision to leave out the western baptismal site. During the negotiations of the UNESCO listings, the original proposal to UNESCO stated the will to expand the site in the future in cooperation with \"the neighboring country\".\n\nSite management\nThe Baptism Site is operated by the Baptism Site Commission, an independent board of trustees appointed by King Abdullah II. In 2017, the Commission reported that approximately 81,000 people visited the site in 2016, a 23% increase from 2015, by mostly European, American, and Arab tourists.\n\nSee also\nÆnon, a baptism site mentioned in the Gospel of John\nBaptism of Jesus\nChronology of Jesus\nList of Christian pilgrimage sites\nList of World Heritage Sites in Jordan\nMandaeism\nMasbuta\nMinistry of Jesus\nNew Testament places associated with Jesus\nQasr al-Yahud, the West Bank side of al-Maghtas\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nDocumentary\nUNESCO report\nThe baptism site of Jesus in Jordan.

          "summary": "Al-Maghtas (Arabic: المغطس, romanized: al-Maghṭas, lit. 'the Baptism' or 'the Immersion'), officially known as Baptism Site \"Bethany Beyond the Jordan\", is an archaeological World Heritage Site in Jordan, on the east bank of the Jordan River, reputed to be the location of the Baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist and venerated as such since at least the Byzantine period. The place has also been referred to as Bethabara (Hebrew: בית עברה) and historically Bethany (בית עניה) or Bethany Beyond the Jordan (see below).\nAl-Maghtas includes two principal archaeological areas: the remnants of a monastery on a mound known as Jabal Mar-Elias (جبل مار إلياس, 'Elijah's Hill') and an area close to the river with remains of churches, baptism ponds and pilgrim and hermit dwellings. The two areas are connected by a stream called Wadi Kharrar (وادي خرار).\nThe strategic location between Jerusalem and the King's Highway is already evident from the Book of Joshua report about the Israelites crossing the Jordan there. Jabal Mar-Elias is traditionally identified as the site of the ascension of the prophet Elijah to heaven. The complete area was abandoned after the 1967 Six-Day War, when both banks of the Jordan became part of the frontline. The area was heavily mined then.\nAfter the signing of the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994, de-mining of the area soon took place at the initiative of Jordanian Prince Ghazi. The site has since then seen several archaeological digs, visits by three Popes (John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis) and by many heads of state, and attracts tourists and pilgrimage activity. In 2015, the site was designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, excluding the western side of the river. Approximately 81,000 people visited the site in 2016, mostly European, American, and Arab tourists. Thousands flock to the site on January 6 to mark Epiphany.",

          "content": "Wadi Rum (Arabic: وادي رم Wādī Ramm, also Wādī al-Ramm, known also as the Valley of the Moon or Red mountains (Arabic: وادي القمر, romanized: Wādī al-Qamar), is a valley cut into the sandstone and granite rock in southern Jordan, near the border with Saudi Arabia and about 60 km (37 mi) to the east of the city of Aqaba. With an area of 720 km2 (280 sq mi) it is the largest wadi (river valley) in Jordan.\nSeveral prehistoric civilizations left petroglyphs, rock inscriptions and ruins in Wadi Rum. Today it is a tourist attraction, offering guided tours, hiking and rock climbing. The Wadi Rum Protected Area has been a UNESCO World Heritage site since 2011.\n\nToponym\nWadi Rum or Wadi Ramm is believed to get its name from the early name of Iram of the Pillars (also called Irum (Arabic: إرم)), a lost city mentioned in the Quran.\n\nGeography\nThe area is centered on the main valley of Wadi Rum. The highest elevation in Jordan is Jabal Umm ad Dami at 1,840 m (6,040 ft) high (SRTM data states 1854 m), located 30 kilometers south of Wadi Rum village. It was first located  by Difallah Ateeg, a Zalabia Bedouin from Rum. On a clear day, it is possible to see the Red Sea and the Saudi border from the top.\nJabal Ram or Jebel Rum (1,734 metres (5,689 ft) above sea level) is the second highest peak in Jordan and the highest peak in the central Rum, rising directly above Rum valley, opposite Jebel um Ishrin, which is possibly one meter lower.\nKhaz'ali Canyon in Wadi Rum is the site of petroglyphs etched into the cave walls depicting humans and antelopes dating back to the Thamudic times. The village of Wadi Rum itself consists of several hundred Bedouin inhabitants with their goat-hair tents and concrete houses and also their four-wheel vehicles, one school for boys and one for girls, a few shops, and the headquarters of the Desert Patrol.\n\nClimate\nWadi Rum experiences a desert climate (Köppen: BWh/BWk). Rainfall is scarce, often occurring as flash floods, and results almost exclusively from thunderstorms. These thunderstorms are caused when cold upper air pools passing through the Eastern Mediterranean interact with the Red Sea thermal low, combined with the presence of subtropical moisture in the mid and high levels of the atmosphere.\n\nGeology\nWadi Rum is located within the Sandstone Mountain and Valley Region of southern Jordan the area is characterized by tall, near vertical mountains of iron-rich, erosion resistant, Umm Ishrin Sandstone, separated by flat-bottom valleys of alluvial sediments, aeolian sands, and salt pans.  The Umm Ishrin is the thickest formation in the Lower Palaeozoic-Upper Cretaceous Nubian Sandstone, underlying the Disi and Umm Sahn sandstone formations, and overlying the Salib Arkosic Formation. The Salib in turn overlies the eroded Aqaba Complex of plutonic granitoids. An aquifer forms along this lithologic contact, with springs forming on the eastern mountain slopes.  Alluvial fans compose most of the alluvial sediments. Aeolian systems include tafoni, natural bridges, and sand dunes. Sand dunes include barkhans, climbing dunes consisting of sand ramps that reach the tops of hills, and echo dunes consisting of sands that have crawled over a hill to be deposited on the lee side.\n\nHistory\nVarious human cultures have inhabited Wadi Rum since prehistoric times, with many cultures–including the Nabataeans–leaving their mark in the form of petroglyphs, inscriptions, and temple ruins.\nAccording to Bienkowski, the area was part of the Kingdom of Edom (between the 13th and 6th centuries BCE). The region contains numerous archaeological remains, including copper mining sites at Wadi Feynan and ancient fortifications. Trade routes connecting Arabia to the Levant passed through the area, contributing to its prosperity.\nCurrently, the majority is made up by the Zalabieh Bedouins who arrived to the region around 1980. The word \"Bedouin\" comes from the Arabic word for desert, pronounced badiya in the Arabic language. The root of this word is bad’a, which translates to \"clear\" and \"obvious\" in Arabic. One central characteristic for Bedouin tribes is the sense of belonging that tribe members feel.\nWhen they first arrived, the Zalabieh bedouins lived in tents. Their village held about 700-800 people. 80% of those people were either retired from the army or the police.\nThe camel is the favorite animal of the Zalabieh bedouins. It is a symbol for male pride. Camel racing is an important sport for the Bedouins.  These races allow Bedouins to engage in male competition, and establish manhood and power within the community.\nWadi Rum was documented by British officer T. E. Lawrence, who passed through several times during the Arab Revolt of 1917–18.  In the 1980s one of the rock formations in Wadi Rum, originally known as \"Jabal al-Mazmar\" (The Mountain of (the) Plague), was named \"The Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\" after Lawrence's book penned in the aftermath of the war, though the 'Seven Pillars' referred to in the book have no connection with Rum.\nLawrence described his entrance into the Valley of Rumm: \"The hills on the right grew taller and sharper, a fair counterpart of the other side which straightened itself to one massive rampart of redness. They drew together until only two miles divided them: and then, towering gradually till their parallel parapets must have been a thousand feet above us, ran forward in an avenue for miles. The crags were capped in nests of domes, less hotly red than the body of the hill; rather grey and shallow. They gave the finishing semblance of Byzantine architecture to this irresistible place: this processional way greater than imagination.\"\nLawrence also described his encounter with the spring, Ain Shalaaleh, \"On the rock-bulge above were clear-cut Nabathaean inscriptions, and a sunk panel incised with a monogram or symbol. Around and about were Arab scratches, including tribe-marks, some of which were witnesses of forgotten migrations: but my attention was only for the splashing of water in a crevice under the shadow of the overhanging rock. I looked in to see the spout, a little thinner than my wrist, jetting out firmly from a fissure in the roof, and falling with that clean sound into a shallow, frothing pool, behind the step which served as an entrance.  Thick ferns and grasses of the finest green made it a paradise just five feet square.\"\nThe discovery of the Nabataean Temple (located walking distance from the Rest House) in 1933 briefly returned the spotlight to the desert. A French team of archaeologists completed the excavations in 1997.\n\nActivities\nTourism\nDesert scenes of Wadi Rum in Lawrence of Arabia from 1962 kick-started Jordan's tourism industry.\nWadi Rum is one of Jordan's most popular tourist sites, attracting 162,000 tourists in 2017. Wadi Rum is home to the Zalabieh tribe, who developed eco-adventure tourism and services throughout the protected area. Using local guides and services brings many benefits to the protected area. In particular, it enables people to continue earning a living from the land and helps to ensure that the protected area remains protected.\nBedouins in Wadi Rum allow tourists to stay overnight in their traditional camps, and provide activities, meals and transport throughout the desert. They also run restaurants and small shops in the villages that provide meals and basic supplies for visitors. Popular activities in Wadi Rum include 4x4 tours, camel rides, hiking, and camping.\nDima and Lama Hattab coordinate an annual marathon in the region called Jabal Ishrin.\n\nRock climbing\nLocal Bedouin have climbed in the sandstone mountains of Wadi Rum for many generations. Many of their 'Bedouin Roads' have been rediscovered and documented by modern climbers. Several are included in the climbing guidebook by Tony Howard, and online by Liên and Gilles Rappeneau.\nIn 1949, Sheikh Hamdan took surveyors to the summit of Jabal Ram.  The first recorded European ascent of Jabal Rum took place in November 1952, by Charmian Longstaff and Sylvia Branford, guided by Sheik Hamdan.  The first recorded rock climbs started in 1984, with the first of many visits by English climbers Howard, Baker, Taylor and Shaw. This group repeated many of the Bedouin routes, accompanied by locals and independently, including, in 1984, Hammad's Route on Jebel Rum, and, in 1985, Sheikh Kraim's Hunter's Slabs and Rijm Assaf on Jebel Rum. Many new routes were climbed in the 1980s, by this team, French guide Wilfried Colonna, by the Swiss Remy brothers, and by Haupolter and Precht.  The first dedicated climbing guide book, Treks and Climb in Wadi Rum, by Tony Howard, was first published in 1987.  Some of the many Bedouin routes have been documented online by Lien and Gilles Rappeneau. A new routes book for climbers is held at the Wadi Rum Guest House.\nThe route Guerre Sainte was climbed in 2000 by Batoux, Petit and friends.  This was the first route in Wadi Rum to be entirely equipped using bolt protection.  The route, on the East Face of Jebel Nassarani North, is 450 m (1,480 ft) long, and graded F7b or F7aA0.\n\nFilming location\nThe area has been used as a background setting in a number of films. Filmmakers are particularly drawn to it for science fiction films set on Mars.\nThe Location Managers Guild recognized the Jordanian Royal Film Commission with its LMGI Award for Outstanding Film Commission in 2017 for its work on Rogue One, which was filmed at Wadi Rum. The RFC was previously nominated for its work with The Martian.\n\nLawrence of Arabia – David Lean filmed much of this 1962 film on location in Wadi Rum.\nPrometheus – scenes for the Alien Planet\nThe Last Days on Mars – filmed for exterior shots representing the surface of the titular planet for this 2013 film.\nThe Martian – filming for the Ridley Scott film began in March 2015, for shots that stood in for the surface of Mars.\nTheeb – Filmed mostly in Wadi Rum, as well as Wadi Araba.\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story, used for scenes set on Jedha.\nAladdin, 2019 live action remake of the 1992 Disney animated film of the same name.\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, used for the desert planet Pasaana.\nDune (2021), used as a location for the desert planet Arrakis. Timothée Chalamet called Wadi Rum 'awe-inspiring'.\nDune: Part Two, used as a filming location.\nAadujeevitham – The desert scenes of the 2024 Malayalam film were mostly shot on locations in Wadi Rum.\nMoon Knight (2022), used for the scenes outside Ammit's tomb.\nThe Amazing Race 34\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4 (2023), used for a desert scene while John Wick is on the move.\nSpecial Forces: World's Toughest Test season 1\nBade Miyan Chote Miyan (2024)\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of World Heritage Sites in Jordan\nNature reserves in Jordan\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nPhotos of Wadi Rum, The American Center of Research\nPhotos of Wadi Rum from the Manar al-Athar photo archive",

          "content": "The Dead Sea (Arabic: اَلْبَحْر الْمَيِّت, romanized: al-Baḥr al-Mayyit; or اَلْبَحْر الْمَيْت, al-Baḥr al-Mayt; Hebrew: יַם הַמֶּלַח, romanized: Yam hamMelaḥ), also known by other names, is a landlocked salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east, the Israeli-occupied West Bank to the west and Israel to the southwest. It lies in the endorheic basin of the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.\nAs of 2025, the lake's surface is 439.78 metres (1,443 ft) below sea level, making its shores the lowest land-based elevation on Earth. It is 304 m (997 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342 g/kg, or 34.2% (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, 9.6 times as salty as the ocean—and has a density of 1.24 kg/litre, which makes swimming similar to floating. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea's main, northern basin is 50 kilometres (31 mi) long and 15 kilometres (9 mi) wide at its widest point.\nThe Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean basin for thousands of years. It was one of the world's first health resorts, and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilisers. Today, tourists visit the sea on its Israeli, Jordanian and West Bank coastlines.\nThe Dead Sea is receding at a swift rate; its surface area today is 605 km2 (234 sq mi), having been 1,050 km2 (410 sq mi) in 1930. Multiple canal and pipeline proposals, such as the scrapped Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance project, have been made to reduce its recession.\n\nNames\nThe English name \"Dead Sea\" is a calque of the Arabic name, itself a calque of earlier Greek and Latin names, in reference to the scarcity of aquatic life caused by the lake's extreme salinity.\nHistorical English names include the Salt Sea, Lake of Sodom from the biblical account of its destruction and Lake Asphaltites from Greek and Latin.\nThe name \"Dead Sea\" occasionally appears in Hebrew literature as Yām HamMāvet (ים המוות), 'Sea of Death'. However, the most common name for the lake in both biblical and modern Hebrew—and also its oldest known name—is the 'Sea of Salt' (Hebrew: ים המלח, romanized: Yām HamMelaḥ). Other Hebrew names for the lake also mentioned in the Bible are the Sea of Arabah (Hebrew: ים הערבה, romanized: Yām Ha'Ărāvâ) and the Eastern Sea (Hebrew: היםהקדמוני, romanized: HaYām HaQadmōnî). In the Talmud, it is called 'Sea of Salt' or 'Sea of Sodom'.\nThe Arabic name is al-Bahr al-Mayyit (البحر الميت), or usually without the article al-. It is also known in Arabic as the 'Sea of Lot' (Arabic: بحر لوط, romanized: baḥr Lūṭ, or بُحَيْرَة Buhayrat, بَحْرَة Bahret, or بِرْكَة لوط Birket Lūṭ) from the nephew of Abraham whose wife was said to have turned into a pillar of salt during the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Less often, it has been known in Arabic as the Sea of Zoara (بَحْر صُوغَر) from a formerly important city along its shores.\nBecause of the large volume of ancient trade in the lake's naturally occurring free-floating bitumen, its usual names in ancient Greek and Roman geography were some form of Asphalt Lake (Ancient Greek: Ἀσφαλτίτης, romanized: Asphaltítēs; or no: Ἀσφαλτίτις Λίμνη, romanized: Asphaltítis Límnē; Latin: Lacus Asphaltites) or Asphalt Sea (Ἀσφαλτίτης Θάλασσα, Asphaltítēs Thálassa).\nIt was also known as the 'Dead Sea' (Ancient Greek: Νεκρά Θάλασσα, romanized: Nekrá Thálassa; Latin: Mare Mortuum). Another ancient name is the \"Jewish Sea,\" (Latin: Iudaicum mare), a term used by the second-century Roman historian Tacitus.\n\nGeography\nThe Dead Sea is a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and Palestine's Israeli-occupied West Bank and Israel to the west. It is an endorheic lake, meaning there are no outlet streams.\nThe Dead Sea lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, a geographic feature formed by the Dead Sea Transform (DST). This left lateral-moving transform fault lies along the tectonic plate boundary between the African Plate and the Arabian Plate. It runs between the East Anatolian Fault zone in Turkey and the northern end of the Red Sea Rift offshore of the southern tip of Sinai.\nWater feeds into the Dead Sea from various sources, many small or intermittent, including:\n\nJordan River, international border from the north\nArava Stream (Wadi Arava), international border from the south\nWadi Mujib (Arnon Stream), Jordan, Karak Governorate\nWadi Darga (Wadi Darajeh, Nahal Darga, or Nahal Dragot), West Bank\nWadi al-Hasa (Brook of Zered), Jordan, boundary between Karak Governorate and Tafilah Governorate\nNahal Arugot (Wadi Areijeh or Wadi Argot), mouth at Ein Gedi, Israel\nWadi Wala, Jordan side\nWadi Zarqa Ma'in, Jordan side\nNahal Tur, West Bank\nNahal Og, West Bank\nGroundwater seepage\nDirect rainfall\n(Wadi is the Arabic term for a river valley with a small or intermittent stream; Nahal is the equivalent in Hebrew. The two terms are often used interchangeably in English names for the same body of water.)\nThe water of Wadi Hassa is now completely consumed in Jordan. The Jordan River, which passes through the Sea of Galilee, has been substantially diverted. It currently only contributes about one-sixth of the inflow to the Dead Sea, less than direct rainfall.\nThere are also small perennial springs under and around the Dead Sea, forming pools and quicksand pits along the edges.\nThe Wadi Mujib valley, 420 m below the sea level in the southern part of the Jordan valley, is a biosphere reserve, with an area of 212 km2 (82 sq mi).\nRainfall is scarcely 100 mm (4 in) per year in the northern part of the Dead Sea and barely 50 mm (2 in) in the southern part. The Dead Sea zone's aridity is due to the rainshadow effect of the Judaean Mountains. The highlands east of the Dead Sea receive more rainfall than the Dead Sea itself.\nTo the west of the Dead Sea, the Judaean mountains rise less steeply and are much lower than the mountains to the east. Along the southwestern side of the lake is a 210 m (700 ft) tall halite mineral formation called Mount Sodom.\n\nGeology\nFormation theories\nThere are two contending hypotheses about the origin of the low elevation of the Dead Sea. The older hypothesis is that the Dead Sea lies in a true rift zone, an extension of the Red Sea Rift, or even of the Great Rift Valley of eastern Africa. A more recent hypothesis is that the Dead Sea basin is a consequence of a \"step-over\" discontinuity along the Dead Sea Transform, creating an extension of the crust with consequent subsidence.\n\nSedom Lagoon\nDuring the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene, what is now the valley of the Jordan River, Dead Sea, and the northern Wadi Arabah was repeatedly inundated by waters from the Mediterranean Sea. The waters formed in a narrow, crooked bay that is called by geologists the Sedom Lagoon, which was connected to the sea through what is now the Jezreel Valley. The floods of the valley came and went depending on long-scale changes in the tectonic and climatic conditions.\nThe Sedom Lagoon extended at its maximum from the Sea of Galilee in the north to somewhere around 50 km (30 mi) south of the current southern end of the Dead Sea, and the subsequent lakes never surpassed this expanse. The Hula Depression was never part of any of these water bodies due to its higher elevation and the high threshold of the Korazim block separating it from the Sea of Galilee basin.\n\nSalt deposits\nThe Sedom Lagoon deposited evaporites mainly consisting of rock salt, which eventually reached a thickness of 2.3 km (1.43 mi) on the old basin floor in the area of today's Mount Sedom.\n\nLake formation\nAccording to Kafri, during the late Neogene, i.e. in the Pliocene (ended c. 2.5 million years ago), the eustatic sea level was at 50–100 metres above the current sea level, thus flooding the northern valleys connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the Jordan Rift Valley, which led to the creation of a crooked-shaped lagoon. This high eustatic sea level situation subsequently came to an end, and the ocean could no longer flood the area. Thus, the long lagoon became a landlocked lake, which – due to the high evaporation rate – retreated toward the lower, southern part of the rift valley. However, Mordechai Stein considers the formation process as not yet clarified, speaking of a late Pliocene-early Pleistocene process in which tectonics might also have played a part in blocking water ingression from the Mediterranean to its former bay or lagoon.\nThe first prehistoric lake to follow the Sedom Lagoon is named Lake Amora (which possibly appeared in the early Pleistocene; its sediments developed into the Amora (Samra) Formation, dated to over 200–80 kyr BP), followed by Lake Lisan (c. 70–14 kyr) and finally by the Dead Sea.\n\nLake salinity\nThe water levels and salinity of the successive lakes (Amora, Lisan, Dead Sea) have either risen or fallen as an effect of the tectonic dropping of the valley bottom, and due to climate variation. As the climate became more arid, Lake Lisan finally shrank and became saltier, leaving the Dead Sea as its last remainder.\nFrom 70,000 to 12,000 years ago, Lake Lisan's level was 100 to 250 m (330 to 820 ft) higher than its current level, possibly due to lower evaporation than in the present. Its level fluctuated dramatically, rising to its highest level around 26,000 years ago, indicating a very wet climate in the Near East. Around 10,000 years ago, the lake's level dropped dramatically, probably even lower than today. During the last several thousand years, the lake has fluctuated approximately 400 m (1,300 ft), with some significant drops and rises. Current theories as to the cause of this dramatic drop in levels rule out volcanic activity; therefore, it may have been a seismic event.\n\nSalt mounts formation\nIn prehistoric times, great amounts of sediment collected on the floor of Lake Amora. The sediment was heavier than the salt deposits and squeezed the salt deposits upwards into what are now the Lisan Peninsula and Mount Sodom (on the southwest side of the lake). Geologists explain the effect in terms of a bucket of mud into which a large flat stone is placed, forcing the mud to creep up the sides of the bucket. When the floor of the Dead Sea dropped further due to tectonic forces, the salt mounts of Lisan and Mount Sodom stayed in place as high cliffs (see salt dome).\n\nClimate\nThe Dead Sea has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), with year-round sunny skies and dry air. It has less than 50 millimetres (2 in) mean annual rainfall and a summer average temperature between 32 and 39 °C (90 and 102 °F). Winter average temperatures range between 20 and 23 °C (68 and 73 °F). The region has weaker ultraviolet radiation, particularly the UVB (erythrogenic rays). Given the higher atmospheric pressure, the air has a slightly higher oxygen content (3.3% in summer to 4.8% in winter) as compared to oxygen concentration at sea level. Barometric pressures at the Dead Sea were measured between 1061 and 1065 hPa and clinically compared with health effects at higher altitude. (This barometric measure is about 5% higher than sea level standard atmospheric pressure of 1013.25 hPa, which is the global ocean mean or ATM.) The Dead Sea affects temperatures nearby because of the moderating effect a large body of water has on climate. During the winter, sea temperatures tend to be higher than land temperatures, and vice versa during the summer months. This is the result of the water's mass and specific heat capacity. On average, there are 192 days above 30 °C (86 °F) annually.\n\nChemistry\nWith 34.2% salinity (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, though Lake Vanda in Antarctica (35%), Lake Assal in Djibouti (34.8%), Lagoon Garabogazköl in the Caspian Sea (up to 35%) and some hypersaline ponds and lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica (such as Don Juan Pond (44%)) have reported higher salinities.\nIn the 19th century and the early 20th century, the surface layers of the Dead Sea were less salty than today, which resulted in an average density in the range of 1.15–1.17 g/cm3 instead of the present value of around 1.25 g/cm3. A sample tested by Bernays in the 19th century had a salinity of 19%. By the year 1926, the salinity had increased (although it was also suspected that the salinity varies seasonally and depends on the distance from the mouth of the Jordan).\nUntil the winter of 1978–79, when a major mixing event took place, the Dead Sea was composed of two stratified layers of water that differed in temperature, density, age, and salinity. The topmost 35 meters (115 ft) or so of the Dead Sea had an average salinity of about 30%, and a temperature that swung between 19 and 37 °C (66 and 99 °F). Underneath a zone of transition, the lowest level of the Dead Sea had waters of a consistent 22 °C (72 °F) temperature, salinity of over 34%, and complete saturation of sodium chloride (NaCl). Since the water near the bottom is saturated with NaCl, that salt precipitates out of solution onto the sea floor.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, water inflow to the Dead Sea from the Jordan River was reduced as a result of large-scale irrigation and generally low rainfall. By 1975, the upper water layer was saltier than the lower layer. Nevertheless, the upper layer remained suspended above the lower layer because its waters were warmer and thus less dense. When the upper layer cooled so its density was greater than the lower layer, the waters mixed (1978–79). For the first time in centuries, the lake was a homogeneous body of water. Since then, stratification has begun to redevelop.\nThe mineral content of the Dead Sea is very different from that of ocean water. The exact composition of the Dead Sea water varies mainly with season, depth and temperature. In the early 1980s, the concentration of ionic species (in g/kg) of Dead Sea surface water was Cl− (181.4), Br− (4.2), SO42− (0.4), HCO3− (0.2), Ca2+ (14.1), Na+ (32.5), K+ (6.2) and Mg2+ (35.2). The total salinity was 276 g/kg. These results show that the composition of the salt, as anhydrous chlorides on a weight percentage basis, was calcium chloride (CaCl2) 14.4%, potassium chloride (KCl) 4.4%, magnesium chloride (MgCl2) 50.8% and sodium chloride (NaCl) 30.4%. In comparison, the salt in the water of most oceans and seas is approximately 85% sodium chloride. The concentration of sulfate ions (SO42−) is very low, and the concentration of bromide ions (Br−) is the highest of all waters on Earth.\n\nThe salt concentration of the Dead Sea fluctuates around 31.5%. This is unusually high and results in a nominal density of 1.24 kg/L. Anyone can easily float in the Dead Sea because of natural buoyancy. In this respect the Dead Sea is similar to the Great Salt Lake in Utah in the United States.\nAn unusual feature of the Dead Sea is its discharge of asphalt. From deep seeps, the Dead Sea constantly spits up small pebbles and blocks of the black substance. Asphalt-coated figurines and bitumen-coated Neolithic skulls from archaeological sites have been found. Egyptian mummification processes used asphalt imported from the Dead Sea region.\n\nPutative therapies\nThe Dead Sea area has become a location for health research and potential treatment for several reasons. The mineral content of the water, the low content of pollens and other allergens in the atmosphere, the reduced ultraviolet component of solar radiation, and the higher atmospheric pressure at this great depth each may have specific health effects. For example, persons experiencing reduced respiratory function from diseases such as cystic fibrosis seem to benefit from the increased atmospheric pressure.\nThe region's climate and low elevation have made it a popular center for assessment of putative therapies:\n\nClimatotherapy: Treatment which exploits local climatic features such as temperature, humidity, sunshine, barometric pressure and special atmospheric constituents\nHeliotherapy: Treatment that exploits the biological effects of the sun's radiation\nThalassotherapy: Treatment that exploits bathing in Dead Sea water\nThere is evidence that the  unique attenuation and spectrum of UV rays near the Dead Sea contribute to effective photoclimatherapy for psoriasis, in part because the reduced exposure to solar radiation allows for longer periods of sunbathing.\nRhinosinusitis patients receiving Dead Sea saline nasal irrigation exhibited improved symptom relief compared to standard hypertonic saline spray in one study.\nDead Sea mud pack therapy has been suggested to temporarily relieve pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knees. According to researchers of the Ben Gurion University of the Negev, treatment with mineral-rich mud compresses can be used to augment conventional medical therapy.\n\nLife forms\nThe sea is called \"dead\" because its high salinity prevents macroscopic aquatic organisms, such as fish and aquatic plants, from living in it, though minuscule quantities of bacteria and microbial fungi are present.\nIn times of flood, the salt content of the Dead Sea can drop from its usual 35% to 30% or lower. It temporarily comes to life in the wake of rainy winters. In 1980, after one such rainy winter, the normally dark blue Dead Sea turned red. Researchers from Hebrew University of Jerusalem found it to be teeming with an alga called Dunaliella. Dunaliella in turn nourished carotenoid-containing (red-pigmented) halobacteria, whose presence caused the color change. Since 1980, the basin has been dry and the algae and the bacteria have not returned in measurable numbers.\nIn 2011 a group of scientists from Be'er Sheva, Israel and Germany discovered fissures in the floor of the Dead Sea by scuba diving and observing the surface. These fissures allow fresh and brackish water to enter. They sampled biofilms surrounding the fissures and discovered numerous species of bacteria and archaea.\n\nHuman settlement\nThere are several small communities near the Dead Sea. These include Ein Gedi, Neve Zohar and the Israeli settlements in the Megilot Regional Council: Kalya, Mitzpe Shalem and Avnat. There is a nature preserve at Ein Gedi, and several Dead Sea hotels are located on the southwest end at Ein Bokek near Neve Zohar. Highway 90 runs north–south on the Israeli side for a total distance of 565 km (351 mi) from Metula on the Lebanese border in the north to its southern terminus at the Egyptian border near the Red Sea port of Eilat.\nPotash City is a small community on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, and others including Suweima. Highway 65 runs north–south on the Jordanian side from near Jordan's northern tip down past the Dead Sea to the port of Aqaba.\n\nHuman history\nBiblical period\nDwelling in caves near the Dead Sea is recorded in the Hebrew Bible as having taken place before the Israelites came to Canaan, and extensively at the time of King David.\nJust northwest of the Dead Sea is Jericho. Somewhere, perhaps on the southeastern shore, would be the cities mentioned in the Book of Genesis which were said to have been destroyed in the time of Abraham: Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 18) and the three other \"Cities of the Plain\", Admah, Zeboim and Zoar (Deuteronomy 29:23). Zoar escaped destruction when Abraham's nephew Lot escaped to Zoar from Sodom (Genesis 19:21–22). Before the destruction, the Dead Sea was a valley full of natural tar pits, which was called the vale of Siddim. King David was said to have hidden from Saul at Ein Gedi nearby.\nIn Ezekiel 47:8–9 there is a specific prophecy that the sea will \"be healed and made fresh\", becoming a normal lake capable of supporting marine life. A similar prophecy is stated in Zechariah 14:8, which says that \"living waters will go out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea [likely the Dead Sea] and half to the western sea [the Mediterranean].\"\nDuring the First Temple period, the kingdom of Judah ruled the western shore of the Dead Sea, while Moab controlled the eastern shore. To the south were the Edomites. Judah established several fortresses along its side of the sea. Development in this area was likely driven by new economic opportunities arising from the Dead Sea's natural resources, including salt, bitumen, as well as cash crops. Both Ein Gedi and Jericho on Judah's side were vital centers for cultivating the highly prized Judean date palms during this time. Ein Gedi thrived as a major economic hub in the final century of Judah, before its destruction on the eve of the Babylonian captivity.\n\nHellenistic and Roman period\nGreek and Jewish writers report that the Nabateans had monopolistic control over the Dead Sea.\n\nArchaeological evidence shows multiple anchorages existing on both sides of the sea, including in Ein Gedi, Khirbet Mazin (where the ruins of a Hasmonean-era dry dock are located), Numeira and near Masada. Josephus identified the Dead Sea in geographic proximity to the ancient Biblical city of Sodom. However, he referred to the lake by its Greek name, Asphaltites.\nHerod the Great, king of Judaea, built or rebuilt several fortresses and palaces along the western shore of the Dead Sea, with Masada being the most famous. Another historically important fortress was Machaerus (מכוור), on the eastern bank, where, according to Josephus, John the Baptist was imprisoned by Herod Antipas and died.\nDuring the Hellenistic and Roman periods, some Essenes, an ascetic Jewish sect, settled along the western shore of the Dead Sea. Roman historian Pliny the Elder identifies their location with the words, \"on the west side of the Dead Sea, away from the coast... [above] the town of Engeda\" (Natural History, Bk 5.73). Based on this, It is widely accepted, though still debated, that the Jewish community at Qumran was part of the Essene sect, and that the \"Dead Sea Scrolls\" discovered in nearby caves during the 20th century were their library.\nThe Dead Sea region was active during the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE). Early in the conflict, a group of Sicarii, a radical Jewish sect, seized control of the fortress of Masada and killed the Roman garrison stationed there. After their leader was killed in Jerusalem, the Sicarii fled to Masada and took refuge in the fortress. In 68 CE, Roman commander Vespasian, tasked with suppressing the Jewish revolt, arrived at the Dead Sea and tested its buoyancy by throwing bound, non-swimmer captives into the water. Archaeological evidence suggests that around this time, the Qumran community was destroyed. The Sicarii at Masada continued to resist the Romans after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, holding out until 73/74 CE, when a siege by the Roman Legio X Fretensis resulted in the deaths of 960 inhabitants by suicide, according to Josephus. The Roman camps surrounding Masada were constructed by Jewish slaves who received water from nearby towns, which were supplied with drinking water from the Ein Feshcha springs and other nearby sweetwater sources.\n\nThe town of Ein Gedi, mentioned many times in the Mishna, produced persimmon for the temple's fragrance and for export, using a secret recipe. \"Sodomite salt\" was an essential mineral for the temple's holy incense, but was said to be dangerous for home use and could cause blindness.\n\nByzantine period\nThe sixth-century mosaic known as the Madaba Map indicates that trade across the Dead Sea was very prevalent during the Byzantine period. \nConnected with the Judean wilderness to its northwest and west, the Dead Sea was a place of escape and refuge. The remoteness of the region attracted Greek Orthodox monks since the Byzantine era. Their monasteries, such as Saint George in Wadi Kelt and Mar Saba in the Judaean Desert, are places of pilgrimage.\nThe Jewish village of Ein Gedi, which had been continuously inhabited since the 5th century BCE, was destroyed in the 7th century by a devastating fire.\n\nMedieval period\nFrom the seventh century onwards, the Dead Sea area entered a period of decline and its population decreased. The cultivation of sugarcane near the northern and southern shores of the lake began to develop during the Crusader period and reached its peak under the Mamluks.\n\nModern times\nIn the 19th century the River Jordan and the Dead Sea were explored by boat primarily by Christopher Costigan in 1835, Thomas Howard Molyneux in 1847, William Francis Lynch in 1848, and John MacGregor in 1869. The full text of W. F. Lynch's 1849 book Narrative of the United States' Expedition to the River Jordan and the Dead Sea is available online. Charles Leonard Irby and James Mangles travelled along the shores of the Dead Sea already in 1817–18, but didn't navigate on its waters.\n\nExplorers and scientists arrived in the area to analyze the minerals and research the unique climate.\nAfter the find of the \"Moabite Stone\" in 1868 on the plateau east of the Dead Sea, Moses Wilhelm Shapira and his partner Salim al-Khouri forged and sold a whole range of presumed \"Moabite\" antiquities, and in 1883 Shapira presented what is now known as the \"Shapira Strips\", a supposedly ancient scroll written on leather strips which he claimed had been found near the Dead Sea. The strips were declared to be forgeries and Shapira took his own life in disgrace.\nThe 1922 census of Palestine lists 100 people (68 Muslims and 32 Christians) with \"Dead Sea & Jordan\" as their main locality. The 1931 census shows a sharp increase with 535 people (264 Muslims, 230 Jews, 21 Christians, 17 Druze, and three with no religion) listing \"Dead Sea\" as their main village/town. The 1938 nor 1945 village statistics does not give a number for the general Dead Sea area.\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, hundreds of Jewish religious documents dated between 150 BCE and 70 CE were found in caves near the ancient settlement of Qumran, about one mile (1.6 kilometres) inland from the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea (presently in the West Bank). They became known and famous as the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nThe world's lowest roads, Highway 90, run along the Israeli and West Bank shores of the Dead Sea, along with Highway 65 on the Jordanian side, at 393 m (1,289 ft) below sea level.\n\nTourism and leisure\nBritish Mandate period\nA golf course named for Sodom and Gomorrah was built by the British at Kalia on the northern shore.\n\nIsrael\nThe first major Israeli hotels were built in nearby Arad, and since the 1960s at the Ein Bokek resort complex.\nIsrael has 15 hotels along the Dead Sea shore, generating total revenues of $291 million in 2012. Most Israeli hotels and resorts on the Dead Sea are on a six-kilometre (3.7-mile) stretch of the southern shore.\n\nJordan\nOn the Jordanian side, nine international franchises have opened seaside resort hotels near the King Hussein Bin Talal Convention Center, along with resort apartments, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. The 9 hotels have boosted the Jordanian side's capacity to 2,800 rooms.\nOn 22 November 2015, the Dead Sea panorama road was included along with 40 archaeological locations in Jordan, to become live on Google Street View.\n\nPalestine (West Bank)\nThe portion of Dead Sea coast which Palestinians could possibly eventually manage is about 40 kilometres (25 miles) long. The World Bank estimates that such Dead Sea tourism industry could generate $290 million of revenues per year and 2,900 jobs. However, Palestinians have been unable to obtain construction permits for tourism-related investments on the Dead Sea. According to the World Bank, officials in the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities state that the only way to apply for such permits is through the Joint Committees established under the Oslo Agreement, but the relevant committee has not met with any degree of regularity since 2000.\n\nChemical industry\nBritish Mandate period\nIn the early part of the 20th century, the Dead Sea began to attract interest from chemists who deduced the sea was a natural deposit of potash (potassium chloride) and bromine. A concession was granted by the British Mandatory government to the newly formed Palestine Potash Company in 1929. Its founder, Siberian Jewish engineer and pioneer of Lake Baikal exploitation, Moses Novomeysky, had worked for the charter for over ten years having first visited the area in 1911. The first plant, on the north shore of the Dead Sea at Kalya, commenced production in 1931 and produced potash by solar evaporation of the brine. Employing Arabs and Jews, it was an island of peace in turbulent times. In 1934 a second plant was built on the southwest shore, in the Mount Sodom area, south of the 'Lashon' region of the Dead Sea. Palestine Potash Company supplied half of Britain's potash during World War II. Both plants were destroyed by the Jordanians in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.\n\nIsrael\nThe Dead Sea Works was founded in 1952 as a state-owned enterprise based on the remnants of the Palestine Potash Company. In 1995, the company was privatized and it is now owned by Israel Chemicals. From the Dead Sea brine, Israel produces (2001) 1.77 million tons potash, 206,000 tons elemental bromine, 44,900 tons caustic soda, 25,000 tons magnesium metal, and sodium chloride. Israeli companies generate around US$3 billion annually from the sale of Dead Sea minerals (primarily potash and bromine), and from other products that are derived from Dead Sea Minerals.\n\nJordan\nOn the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, Arab Potash (APC), formed in 1956, produces 2.0 million tons of potash annually, as well as sodium chloride and bromine. The plant is located at Safi, South Aghwar Department, in the Karak Governorate.\nJordanian Dead Sea mineral industries generate about $1.2 billion in sales (equivalent to 4 percent of Jordan's GDP).\n\nWest Bank\nThe Palestinian Dead Sea Coast is about 40 kilometres (25 miles) long. The Palestinian economy is unable to benefit from Dead Sea chemicals due to restricted access, permit issues and the uncertainties of the investment climate. The World Bank estimates that a Palestinian Dead Sea chemicals industry could generate $918M incremental value added per year, \"almost equivalent to the contribution of the entire manufacturing sector of Palestinian territories today\".\n\nExtraction\nBoth companies, Dead Sea Works Ltd. and Arab Potash, use extensive salt evaporation pans that have essentially diked the entire southern end of the Dead Sea for the purpose of producing carnallite, potassium magnesium chloride, which is then processed further to produce potassium chloride. The ponds are separated by a central dike that runs roughly north–south along the international border. The power plant on the Israeli side allows production of magnesium metal (by a subsidiary, Dead Sea Magnesium Ltd.).\nDue to the popularity of the sea's therapeutic and healing properties, several companies have also shown interest in the manufacturing and supplying of Dead Sea salts as raw materials for body and skin care products.\n\nRecession and environmental concerns\nReceding shoreline\nSince 1930, when its surface was 1,050 km2 (410 sq mi) and its level was 390 m (1,280 ft) below sea level, the Dead Sea has been monitored continuously. The Dead Sea has been rapidly shrinking since the 1960s because of diversion of incoming water from the Jordan River to the north as part of the National Water Carrier scheme, completed in 1964. The southern end is fed by a canal maintained by the Dead Sea Works, a company that converts the sea's raw materials. From a water surface of 395 m (1,296 ft) below sea level in 1970 it fell 22 to 418 m (72 to 1,371 ft) below sea level in 2006, reaching a drop rate of 1 m (3 ft) per year.  By 2025 it reached a height of 439 m (1,440 ft) below sea level, a drop of more than 1 m (3 ft) per year. As the water level decreases, the characteristics of the Sea and surrounding region may substantially change.\nAs of 2021, the surface of the Sea has shrunk by about 33 percent since the 1960s, which is partly attributed to the much-reduced flow of the Jordan River since the construction of the National Water Carrier project, and the amount of water from the rains reaching the Dead Sea has diminished even further since flash floods started pouring into the sinkholes left by its shrinkage. The EcoPeace Middle East, a joint Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian environmental group, has estimated that the annual flow into the Dead Sea from the Jordan is as of 2021 less than 100,000,000 cubic metres (3.5×109 cu ft) of water, compared with former flows of between 1,200,000,000 cubic metres (4.2×1010 cu ft) and 1,300,000,000 cubic metres (4.6×1010 cu ft).\n\nSources: Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research, Haaretz, Jordan Valley Authority.\n\nSinkholes and their impact\nThe Dead Sea level drop has been followed by a groundwater level drop, causing brines that used to occupy underground layers near the shoreline to be flushed out by freshwater. This is believed to be the cause of the recent appearance of large sinkholes along the western shore—incoming freshwater dissolves salt layers, rapidly creating subsurface cavities that subsequently collapse to form these sinkholes. As of 2021 Ein Gedi, on the western coast, has been subject to a large number of sinkholes appearing in the area, attributed to the decline in the water level of the Dead Sea.\nAs a result of the sinkholes, most beach resorts along the west shore of the northern basin had to be shut down, with just three remaining near the basin's northwest tip (see List of beaches in Palestine: Dead Sea).\n\nLink to the Red Sea\nIn May 2009 at the World Economic Forum, Jordan introduced plans for a \"Jordan National Red Sea Development Project\" (JRSP). This is a plan to convey seawater from the Red Sea near Aqaba to the Dead Sea. Water would be desalinated along the route to provide fresh water to Jordan, with the brine discharge sent to the Dead Sea for replenishment. Israel has expressed its support and will likely benefit from some of the water delivery to its Negev region.\nAt a regional conference in July 2009, officials expressed concern about the declining water levels. Some suggested industrial activities around the Dead Sea might need to be reduced. Others advised environmental measures to restore conditions such as increasing the volume of flow from the Jordan River to replenish the Dead Sea. Currently, only sewage and effluent from fish ponds run in the river's channel. Experts also stressed the need for strict conservation efforts. They said agriculture should not be expanded, sustainable support capabilities should be incorporated into the area and pollution sources should be reduced.\nIn October 2009, the Jordanians accelerated plans to extract around 300 million cubic metres (11 billion cubic feet) of water per year from the Red Sea, desalinate it for use as fresh water and send the waste water to the Dead Sea by tunnel, despite concerns about inadequate time to assess the potential environmental impact. According to Jordan's minister for water, General Maysoun Zu'bi, this project could be considered as the first phase of the Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance.\nIn December 2013, Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement for laying a water pipeline to link the Red Sea with the Dead Sea. The pipeline would be 180 km (110 mi) long and is estimated to take up to five years to complete. In January 2015 it was reported that the level of water was dropping by 1 m (3.3 ft) a year.\nOn 27 November 2016, the Jordanian government shortlisted five consortia to implement the project. Jordan's ministry of Water and Irrigation said that the $100 million first phase of the project would begin construction in the first quarter of 2018, and would be completed by 2021. The project was officially abandoned in June 2021, having never broken ground.\n\nSee also\nAral Sea\nList of bodies of water by salinity\nList of drying lakes\nList of places on land with elevations below sea level\nMediterranean–Dead Sea Canal\nBenjamin Elazari Volcani\nPEF rock with the Dead Sea level reference line used between 1900 and 1913\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nThe World Bank, 2013, \"The Red Sea – Dead Sea Water Conveyance Study Program\", and source of basic data on the Dead Sea.\nYehouda Enzel, et al., eds (2006) New Frontiers in Dead Sea Paleoenvironmental Research, Geological Society of America, ISBN 978-0-8137-2401-0\nNiemi, Tina M., Ben-Avraham, Z., and Gat, J., eds., 1997, The Dead Sea: The Lake and Its Setting: N.Y., Oxford University Press, 286 p.\nWorld Bank, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Department, Area C and the Future of the Palestinian Economy, October 2, 2013\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Dead Sea at Wikimedia Commons\n Dead Sea travel guide from Wikivoyage   (Israeli and West Bank part and Jordanian part)\n The dictionary definition of Dead Sea at Wiktionary\nPorter, Josias Leslie (1878). \"Dead Sea\" .

          "summary": "The Dead Sea (Arabic: اَلْبَحْر الْمَيِّت, romanized: al-Baḥr al-Mayyit; or اَلْبَحْر الْمَيْت, al-Baḥr al-Mayt; Hebrew: יַם הַמֶּלַח, romanized: Yam hamMelaḥ), also known by other names, is a landlocked salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east, the Israeli-occupied West Bank to the west and Israel to the southwest. It lies in the endorheic basin of the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.\nAs of 2025, the lake's surface is 439.78 metres (1,443 ft) below sea level, making its shores the lowest land-based elevation on Earth. It is 304 m (997 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342 g/kg, or 34.2% (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, 9.6 times as salty as the ocean—and has a density of 1.24 kg/litre, which makes swimming similar to floating. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea's main, northern basin is 50 kilometres (31 mi) long and 15 kilometres (9 mi) wide at its widest point.\nThe Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean basin for thousands of years. It was one of the world's first health resorts, and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilisers. Today, tourists visit the sea on its Israeli, Jordanian and West Bank coastlines.\nThe Dead Sea is receding at a swift rate; its surface area today is 605 km2 (234 sq mi), having been 1,050 km2 (410 sq mi) in 1930. Multiple canal and pipeline proposals, such as the scrapped Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance project, have been made to reduce its recession.",

بعده.\nيصل عرض البحر الميت في اقصى حد الى 17 كم، بينما يبلغ طوله حوالي 70 كم. وقد بلغت مساحته في عام 2010 حوالي 650 كم2 اذ تقلصت خلال الاربع عقود الماضيه بما يزيد عن 35%. كما يلعب المناخ الصحراوي للمنطقه الذي يمتاز بشده الحراره والجفاف ومعدلات التبخر العاليه دورًا كبيرًا في زياده تركيز تلك الاملاح فيه.\nلقد عانى منسوب البحر الميت مؤخرًا من التراجع المستمر، حيث يرجع هذا الامر الى عدد من الاسباب الرئيسيه، كالاستخدام المكثف لمصادر المياه، واهمها نهر الاردن، وضخ المياه في الحوض الجنوبي، حيث يتكون البحر الميت حاليًا من حوضين؛ شمالي وجنوبي يقسمهما شبه جزيره اللسان. ونتيجه للانخفاض المستمر لهذا المستوى، تعرض الجزء الجنوبي من البحيره للجفاف، حيث انّ الجزء الجنوبي اقل عمقًا من نظيره الشمالي، ويصل ارتفاع منسوب شاطئه الى 401 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر. ومع تجفيف الجزء الجنوبي، تم انشاء برك لتبخير المياه وانتاج البوتاس والمواد الكيماويه الاخرى مثل المنجنيز والمغنسيوم والبرومين في مصانع البوتاس الاسرائيليه، وشركه البوتاس العربيه في الاردن. وتحتاج تلك البرك الى ضخ كبير من مياه البحر الميت وتبخيرها، مما اثّر تاثيرًا كبيرًا على زياده انخفاض مستوى سطح البحر.\nلقد بلغ المعدل السنوي لانخفاض مستوى سطح البحر خلال العقد المنصرم بمقدار يعادل الفقدان لمده سنه كامله، حيث اصبح المستوى ينخفض حوالي متر واحد كل عام. ولقد زاد هذا المعدل في عام 2012 بشكل واضح، فكان انخفاض مستوى البحر 1.40 متر. وقد ادى الانخفاض التراكمي في مستوى المياه الى تغيرات كبيره ايضا في تضاريس المناطق المجاوره وفي البحر الابيض المتوسط بما في ذلك تغيرات لا يمكن الرجوع عنها في الجزء الشمالي، من خلق للمجاري، والانسحاب من الشواطئ، والاضرار التي لحقت بالبنيه التحتيه (الطرق والجسور) والمحميات الطبيعيه.\nيُعد البحر الميت مهماً جدًا للصناعه والسياحه في المنطقه، حيث تُعتبر تركيبه مياهه مختلفه عن المياه الطبيعيه، باحتوائها على تركيز عالي من الكالسيوم والبوتاسيوم. ويُستغل هذا في مصانع الجانبين الاردني والاسرائيلي. وترجع الاهميه التاريخيه والسياحيه لمنطقه حوض البحر الميت الى البحر نفسه والى شواطئه، حيث توجد بعض المعالم الاثريه والدينيه الهامه في المنطقه مثل مسعده، وخربه قمران، وكهف النبي لوط، بالاضافه الى التشكيلات الملحيه الطبيعيه، والمناخ السائد فيه، فكلها جعلت من البحر الميت نقطه جذب سياحيه عالميه، وخصوصًا فيما يتعلق بالسياحه العلاجيه. وتحوي المنطقه على الاف الغرف الفندقيه، حيث تتركز في الجزء الشمالي الشرقي في الاردن، بالاضافه الى الجزء الغربي المطل على الحوض الجنوبي. وقد رُشح ليكون احد عجائب الدنيا السبع الطبيعيه في نطاق البحيرات.\nورغم ان دوله فلسطين لها جزء يطل على البحر الميت الا ان السلطات الاسرائيليه لا تسمح للفلسطينيين باستغلال مواردهم من البحر، بل تمنعهم تماما من الذهاب الى ساحل البحر الميت بحجه الامن. وتشكل حقوق الفلسطينيين في استغلال نصيبهم من البحر الميت نقطه هامه في مباحثات السلام، بالاضافه الى حقوقهم في مياه الشرب.\n\nالتسميه\nاُطلق على البحر الميت تاريخيّا عده اسماء قديمه في العهد القديم مثل: «بحر الملح» و«بحر العربه» و«البحر الشرقي» و«عمق السديم». وفي عهد عيسى المسيح عُرف بـ «بحر الموت»، و«بحر سدوم» نسبه الى منطقه سدوم المجاوره، كما دُعي «البحيره المنتنه» لان مياهه وشواطئه لها رائحه منتنه. كما دُعي «بحيره زغر» نسبه الى بلده زُغر التي كانت تقع على شاطئه الجنوبي الشرقي، واُطلق عليه اسم «بحر الزفت» نسبهً الى قطع الزفت التي كانت تطفو على سطحه في بعض الاحيان وخاصه عند حدوث الزلازل. وقد كان بعض سكان المنطقه يتاجرون في قطع الزفت التي يستخرجونها ويبيعونها. كما ذكره المقدسي في كتابه «احسن التقاسيم في معرفه الاقاليم» باسم «البحيره المقلوبه». وقد سُمي ايضًا «بحيره لوط» نسبهً الى النبي لوط الذي سكن وقومه بالقرب منه قبل ان يحل بهم العذاب. اما الاغريق فكانوا اول من اطلق عليه اسم «البحر الميت» لعدم وجود حياه فيه.\nوحسب نظريه عالم الاراضه البروفيسور ليو بيكارد كان في الماضي جزءا من بحيره واسعه حلوه المياه امتدت على منطقه غور الاردن ومرج ابن عامر وصبت في البحر الابيض المتوسط. وحسب هذه النظريه اسفرت التغييرات في علوّ الارض قبل مليوني عام تقريباً الى انقطاع الوصله بين تلك البحيره والبحر الابيض المتوسط، والى تضيق البحيره الى بحيره طبريا، نهر الاردن والبحر الميت. فادى حصر مياه البحر الميت، وتبخر الماء الى زياده نسبه الاملاح فيه.\n\nالجغرافيا\nيحد البحر الميت من الشرق جبال محافظه مادبا ومحافظه الكرك في الاردن، ومن الغرب الضفه الغربيه وجبال الخليل في فلسطين. اما شمالاً فيحده منخفض البحر الميت ومصب نهر الاردن، ومن الجنوب جرف خنزيره، الذي يُعتبر بدايه وادي عربه. يُعتبر خط التقسيم فيه حدًا فاصلاً بين الاردن وفلسطين تماشيًا مع نهر الاردن في الشمال، ووادي عربه في الجنوب. يقع بين دائرتيّ عرض 31.03 و31.43 شمالاً، وبين خطيّ طول 35.21 و35.35 شرقًا. يبعد عن القدس 24 كم الى الشرق، وعن عمّان 38 كم الى الجنوب الغربي. تبلغ مساحته الاصليه حوالي 1000 كم2، الا انها تقلّصت خلال الاربع عقود الماضيه الى حوالي 650 كم2. ويبلغ اقصى عرض له 17.5 كم، واضيق نقطه تقع عند مضيق اللسان بعرض 2 كم، اما اعمق نقطه فيه فتقع على بعد 5 كم جنوب غرب مصب وادي زرقاء ماعين، ويبلغ عمقها 399 م، بينما ينخفض سطحه بحوالي 395 عن سطح البحر المتوسط.\nوتحف الشواطئ الشرقيه والغربيه للبحر الميت منحدرات عموديه على شكل ابراج صدعيه والتي تشكل جزءاً من الشق السوري الافريقي. ان منحدرات الوادي تتجه الى اعلى برقه الى ناحيه الشمال في اتجاه نهر الاردن والى ناحيه الجنوب في اتجاه وادي عربه. ومن الناحيه التاريخيه فان البحر الميت يتكون من حوضان: الحوض الرئيسي الشمالي والذي يبلغ عمقه 320 مترًا (في عام 1997) والحوض الجنوبي الضحل والذي منه تراجع البحر الميت منذ عام 1978. والحوضين منقسمان عن طريق شبه جزيره لسان ومضايق الموت التي لديها تل من الطمي.\n\nالمناخ\nيتمتع البحر الميت بسماء مشمسه على مدار السنه، بالاضافه الى الهواء الجاف. وتتساقط الامطار على المنطقه بشكل قليل جداً باقل من 50 ملم (2 بوصه) بينما يبلغ متوسط درجه الحراره في الصيف بين 32 و39 درجه مئويه. وتتراوح درجات الحراره في فصل الشتاء المتوسط بين 20 و23 درجه مئويه. كما تعتبر نسبه الرطوبه منخفضه حيث توازي 35% في معدلها. اما الاشعاعات الشمسيه، فلقد دلّت الدراسات على وجود طبقه غنيه بالاوزون فوق سطح البحر تصل الى ارتفاع 25 كيلومتراً، ويقوم الاوزون بالاضافه الى بخار الماء فوق البحر بعمليه ترشيح وفلتره للاشعه الفوق بنفسجيه.\nويُعد تركيز الاكسجين في هواء منطقه البحر الميت الاعلى في العالم، بصفته المنطقه الاكثر انخفاضًا. وتصل نسبه الاكسجين فيه الى 36%، علمًا بان النسبه العالميه تصل الى 26%. اما بالنسبه الى الضغوط الجوي في منطقه البحر الميت، فيترواح بين 796 و799 ملم زئبقي، وبهذا يُعتبر الاعلى في العالم.\n\nالجيولوجيا\nيشكل وادي الاردن جزءاً من الاخدود العظيم (حفره الانهدام التاريخيه) والذي يمتد من تركيا الى شرق افريقيا. وقد تشكل نتيجه تغيرات جيولوجيه شهدتها القشره الارضيه منذ ملايين السنين، وقد تشكّل في قلبها البحر الميت الذي كان يمتد في الاصل على طول 360 كلم من العقبه جنوبًا الى بحيره طبريا شمالاً. يعتبر وادي الاردن بارضه الخصبه ومناخه الدافئ، والبحر الميت بمياهه العلاجيه، مركز جذب سكاني عبر التاريخ، فقد شهد هذا الوادي العديد من الاقوام والحضارات التي تعود الى عصور قديمه جدًا. وقد تم الكشف عن اكثر من 200 موقع اثري حتى اليوم، ومعظم هذه المواقع المحيطه بمنطقه البحر الميت تتصل اتصالاً وثيقًا باحداث ذُكرت في الكتاب المقدس، ومن اهمها كهف النبي لوط.\nوقد اجرى بعض الباحثين الاسرائيليين مسحًا جيولوجيًا لقاع البحر الميت عام 1967، وقالوا: «يبدوا ان قاع البحر الميت الحالي مكون من صخور تكوين اصدم الملحي الذي يقع تحت الحوض الجنوبي للبحر الميت». بمعنى ان هذه الكتله كانت تحت قرى النبي لوط، وان تكوين هذه البقعه المنخفضه كما ورد مشابه لتكوين اصدم، بينما المحيط الموجود فيه هو من تكوينات جيولوجيه مختلفه عنها، هذا بالاضافه الى وجود صدوع مستعرضه حول هذه البقعه تؤكد انها لم تكن اساسًا ضمن التكوين الصخري الموجود فيه، وانما جاءته من منطقه اخرى، وهذا يؤيد حدوث مثل هذا الانزلاق لهذه الكتله الصخريه. كما يؤيد صحه هذا الدليل صوره الاقمار الصناعيه لقاع البحر الميت، والتي يظهر فيها ست نقاط يُعتقد انها تجمعات سكانيه تمثل قرى النبي لوط، وصوره غواصه بريطانيه لنفس المنطقه عام 1957 يظهر فيها ايضًا اثار مساكن وقرى مطموه بالملح.\n\nالتشكل\nيُعتبر البحر الميت ظاهره طبيعيه نادره الوجود في العالم، فهو بحيره مغلقه لا تتصل بالبحار الخارجيه المجاوره (البحر المتوسط والبحر الاحمر). كما يقع في منطقه كانت جزءاً من الموطن الاصلي للانسان الاول، ومهبطًا للديانات السماويه الرئيسيه، ومكانًا لنشوء الحضارات القديمه، ومعبرًا للحركات التجاريه والغزوات العسكريه عبر العصور التاريخيه المتتابعه.\n\nيعود بدايه التشكل الجيولوجي للبحر الميت الى اواخر العصر الثلاثي، اي قبل حوالي 3 - 7 مليون سنه. فقد تكوّن على انقاض البحيرات القديمه التي شغلت الانهدام الاردني حيث يقول علماء الجيولوجيا: ان «بحر تيش» او Tythas الذي يشغل البحر المتوسط جزءاً من مكانه، كان يغطي اغلب اراضي المنطقه العربيه، وبعد انحساره وتراجعه ووصوله الى الشكل الحالي للبحر المتوسط، بقيت منطقه الغور ممتلئه بالمياه مكونه بحيره اصدم القديمه التي كانت تتصل بالبحر المتوسط بواسطه مرج بن عامر ثم غور الاردن الاوسط حتى عصر الميوسين. وبعد عصر الميوسين، انقطع اتصال البحيره الاردنيه القديمه (بحيره ما بعد اصدم) بالبحر المتوسط. واخذت تنحصر شيئاً فشيئاً نتيجه لارتفاع مستوى التبخر في المنطقه بسبب درجات الحراره المرتفعه. ويعتقد العلماء بان البحيره تعرضت لعمليه هبوط ثانيه بسبب الضغط الكبير الواقع عليها، بسبب تركز الاملاح في قاعها حتى تكوّن البحر الميت بشكله الحالي والذي يعتبره علماء الجيولوجيا حاله دراسيه نادره الوجود، حيث يقع اطول فالق ازاحي قاري في العالم يصل امتداده الى اكثر من 1000 كم مصحوب بازاحه جانبيه تبلغ حوالي 105 كم. وقد لفت انهدام البحر الميت بتشكيله الجيولوجي ونشاطه التكتوني انتباه الكثير من العلماء في شتى مجالات علوم الارض.\nتتميز مياه البحر الميت بشده ملوحتها التي تصل الى 340 غم/ لتر في اعماقه، وهي نسبه كبيره جدًا، اذ تبلغ الملوحه فيه عشره اضعاف ملوحه البحار والمحيطات. ويختزن البحر الميت في باطنه ثروه هائله لمجموعه كبيره من الاملاح قد لا تنضب بسبب ضخامه حجمها ودخولها في الصناعات الحديثه. اختلفت الاراء حول اصل تكون هذه الاملاح، وفيما يلي استعراض لثلاث نظريات تفسر كيفيه تكونها:\n\nنظريه ترسيب الاملاح البحريه: وتقول ان هذه الاملاح جاءت من مصدرين هما الترسيب المائي، والترسيب الجوي.\nنظريه تجمع الاملاح التحتيه: وتقول ان الاملاح تكونت من مياه نهر الاردن والاوديه والينابيع الجانبيه التي ترفد البحر الميت مباشره، فهي تحتوي على كميات هائله من الاملاح مشابهه لاملاح البحر الميت.\nنظريه الامطار البركانيه: وتقول ان جزءاً من املاح البحر الميت تكون نتيجه العذاب الذي حل بقوم لوط.\n\nالتركيب الكيمائي\nتُقدر كميه التبخر في مياه البحر الميت بحوالي 1600 ملم في العام. وبحسب الفحوصات التي اُجريت على مياهه فان عمليه التبخر والتغيرات الكيمائيه تحدث خلال الاربعين مترٍ العليا، وما دونها فهو ثابت لا يتغير. اذاً تختلف كميه ونوعيه الاملاح حسب العمق. وتبلغ الاملاح المذابه 44 مليار و957 مليون طن. ومن هذه الكميه تُقدر المواد التاليه بملايين الاطنان: كلوريد المغنيسيوم حوالي 23 الف مليون طن، ملح الطعام حوالي 12 الف مليون طن، كلوريد الكالسيوم حوالي 6 الاف مليون طن، كلوريد البوتاسيوم حوالي الفين مليون طن، بروميد المغنسيوم حوالي 975 مليون طن، كبريتات الكالسيوم حوالي 105 مليون طن، بيكربونات الكالسيوم حوالي 46 مليون طن، وكلوريد الروبيديوم حوالي 12 مليون طن.\nومن الجدير بالذكر، ان هناك مصادر اخرى عملت على زيادره نسبه الاملاح في البحر الميت كالينابيع الساخنه والمعدنيه مثل: ينابيع الزهار الكبريتيه، وحمامات زرقاء ماعين، اذ ان التحاليل التي اُُجريت على مياه هذه المصادر دلت على نفس التركيب الكيماوي لمياه البحر الميت، حتى ان التحاليل الكيميائيه التي اُجريت لمياه منجم بترول اسدم اظهرت علاقتها بمياه البحر الميت.\nان قوه تركيز املاح البحر الميت التي ينفرد بها عن كل بحار العالم الداخليه هي عجيبه في حد ذاتها. ولا يقف الامر عند هذا الحد، بل ان التركيب الكيماوي لمياه هذا البحر يختلف ايضًا عن غيره من بحار العالم الداخليه الاخرى، فهو يتكون في معظمه من املاح الكبريتات والكربونات. والغريب في الامر ايضًا، ان املاح الكالسيوم تكاد تكون معدومه، اذ ان ذلك لا يحدث لاي بحر داخلي مثل البحر الميت. والاغرب من ذلك كله وجود كميه البروم العاليه التي تبلغ 5920 ملغم لكل لتر والتي لا يوجد مثلها في اي بحر معروف، حيث ان كميه البروم في المحيطات تبلغ 290 ملغم/ لتر وفي البحار المالحه 1000 ملغم/ لتر.\n\nالروافد المغذيه\nيغذّي البحر الميت بالاضافه الى نهر الاردن، عدد من الوديان والسيول الممتده على جانبيه الغربي والشرقي. اذ يبلغ عددها من الجانب الغربي 23 واديًا وسيلاً، فيما يبلغ عددها من الشرق 5 فقط.\nوتبلغ مساحه المجاري المتعلقه بالبحر الميت 40,6 كم2. وتاتي معظم تدفقات المياه الى البحر الميت من مناطق ذات الكثافه المطريه النسبيه لمجرى نهر الاردن الى الشمال والمنحدرات العموديه للوادي المتصدع لشرق وغرب البحر الميت. والى الجنوب، يغطي خط تقسيم مياه وادي عربه المناطق القاحله للنقب وصحراء الاردن الجنوبيه.\n\nمشروع القناه\nيمر مُستوى المياه في هذا البحر التاريخي يتراجع حاليًا بمُعدلات لا تُصدق تاركًا خلفه الاف الحفر، حيث يوجد حاليًا ما يُقارب 3000 حُفره على الجانب الغربي ومئات الحُفر على الجانب الشرقي، وذلك بارتفاع شديد في وتيره تشكل هذه الحُفر بشكل فُجائي، في وقت كان البحر يحتوي فيه على 40 حفره فقط في العام 1990. الخُبراء في هذه المجال يُشيرون الى ان مثل هذه الحفر تظهر حاليًا بمُعدّل حُفره واحده يوميًا، وان المخيف فيها هو عدم وجود طريقه بمعرفه مكان او توقيت ظُهورها. ظهور هذه الحفر متعلق بصوره مباشره بتعرض البحر الميت للجفاف بمُعدل متر واحد سنويًا، بحيث تنهار الارض فجاهً وتتشكّل حفر كبيره احيانًا مما يُشكل خطرًا على المناطق المُحيطه بالبحر من مزارع وطرقات وحتى ابنيه كالفنادق او المنازل. وتتشكل الحُفر هذه نتيجهً لتفاعُل المياه العذبه القادمه من مياه الامطار او بعض الينابيع تحت الارض بالاملاح الموجوده في الارض بعد تعرُض مساحات جديده للتجفيف.\nولانقاذ البحر الميت من الجفاف، قام الاردن بالتعاون مع كل من السلطه الفلسطينيه واسرائيل بالتخطيط لمشروع اُطلق عليه «قناه البحرين»، وهو مشروع مقترح لشق قناه تربط بين البحر الميت واحد البحار الـمفتوحه (البحر الاحمر او البحر الابيض المتوسط)، مستفيدا من 400 متر الفرق في منسوب المياه بيـن البحار. قد تعوض المياه المتدفقه عبر القناه انخفاض مستوى البحر الميت بسبب تحويل المياه الى اسرائيل بواسطه سد دغانيا المقام على نقطه الاتصال بين بحيره طبريا ونهر الاردن. وسحب المياه الحلوه المتدفقه طبيعيًا الى البحر الميت الى اجهزه الري الاسرائيليه والفلسطينيه والاردنيه. بالمقابل، عارض المشروع الكثير من المنظمات البيئيه في المنطقه، حيث اشارت عدد من الدراسات ان تدفق حوالي ملياري متر مكعب سنويًا من مياه البحر الاحمر الى البحر الميت سيحدث تاثيرات بالغه الخطوره على كنوز وثروات البحر الاحمر، حيث مناطق الشعب المرجانيه وحدائقها التي لا تقدر بثمن، كما سيغير من تركيبه البحر الميت. من جهه اخرى، يرى نشطاء سياسيون ان للمشروع ابعادًا سياسيه واستراتيجه تضر الاردن والسلطه الفلسطينيه، وهي بناء المستوطنات الاسرائيليه، وجلب المزيد من المهاجرين وخلق واقع ديموغرافي جديد في المنطقه وخلق رافد بشري مستمر لقواها العسكريه.\nوقد تم التوقيع رسميًا على اتفاقيه بين الاطراف الثلاثه في كانون الاول/ ديسمبر 2013 لمد خط انابيب ينقل المياه من البحر الاحمر الى البحر الميت، حيث استمر تداول خطه ربط البحرين الاحمر والميت على مدار عقود وخضعت للعديد من التغيرات، كما انها كانت مُتضمنه ايضًا في اتفاقيه السلام بين اسرائيل والاردن عام 1994. ويشمل المشروع مرحله اوليّه سيتم خلالها بناء خط انابيب لنقل المياه طوله 180 كم من محطه تحليه المياه في ميناء العقبه الاردني الموجود على الساحل الشمالي الشرقي للبحر الاحمر الى البحر الميت.\nويهدف المشروع الى منع تدهور وانكماش البحر الميت وتوصيل المياه النقيه الى الاردنيين والفلسطينيين والاسرائيليين. ويعاني الاردن خصيصًا مؤخرًا من تداعيات نقص المياه بسبب زياده عدد السكان في ظل استمرار تدفق اللاجئين من سوريا. وقد اعلن البنك الدولي ان البرنامج التجريبي قابل للتطبيق بتكلفه 10 مليارات دولار امريكي، لكنه حذر وكذلك المنظمات البيئيه من العديد من المخاوف البيئيه المتعلقه بالمشروع.\n\nالتاريخ\nنالت منطقه سدوم وعموره اهميه لاهوتيه في كتابات الكثير من الباحثين ما بين الوصف كما في كتابات الرحاله العرب وغيرهم، واتباع منهجيه علميه في الدراسه عند بعض الباحثين ساهمت في تسليط بعض الضوء على حادثه الخسف الشهيره التي عمت منطقه الحوض الجنوبي للبحر الميت. كما اكد الكثير من العلماء ان مكان الخسف قد تم في مكان الحوض الجنوبي للبحر الميت الحالي، وبان المدن التي ذكرت في القران، والتوراه كانت موجوده في مكان الحوض الجنوبي، وان الخسف الذي حدث في الالف الثاني قبل الميلاد قد دمّر المدن ومن سكنها. وقد استبعد بعضهم ان البحر الميت قد تكون في تلك الفتره فقد كان موجودا قبل حادثه الخسف. وقد اكدت بعض الدارسات ان البحر الميت قد تشكّل بعد تكون عده بحيرات سبقت مرحله البحر الميت الحالي، وان بعض هذه البحيرات كانت ذات مياه عذبه.\nولقد اتفق العلماء على ان منخفض البحر الميت قد شغله عده بحيرات سبقت تشكل البحر الميت الحالي وهي بحيره اصدام، بحيره السمره، بحيره اللسان، وبحيره داميه، والبحر الميت الحالي.\nفعندما بدا تشكل منخفض الاغوار، كانت الجبال الشرقيه متصله مع الجبال الغربيه. وعندها بدا منخفض الاغوار بالتشكل بالحركه الافقيه او العموديه كما اشار العديد من العلماء. ومهما يكن الامر فقد انفرج منخفض الاغوار على شكل احواض واسعه لكنها لم تكن عميقه، ويبدو انه كان متصلا مع البحر المتوسط. ومع توالي عمليه الانخفاض انقطع الاتصال ما بين البحر المتوسط ومنخفض البحر الميت. وينقطع بذلك اتصال البحر المتوسط مع الاغوار والذي زوّدها بالمياه فترات زمنيه طويله نسبيا. واصبح مصدر المياه التي تغذي منطقه الاغوار يعتمد بشكل مباشر على مياه الامطار.\nوقد تعرضت تلك البحيرات خلال تاريخها الطويل الى اختلاف من حيث الانخفاض عن مستوى سطح البحر والامتداد الافقي وملوحه المياه. وكان تعتمد بشكل مباشر على رطوبه الجو ومعدلات الامطار، حيث كانت تسود المنطقه فترات من الجفاف تليها فترات انتقاليه ثم فترات رطبه مما يؤدي الى جفاف تلك الاجسام المائيه او الامتلاء في الفترات الرطبه. وتشير المصادر الجيولوجيه الى ان بحيره السمره نتجت عن فتره رطوبه رافقها ازدياد كبير في معدلات الامطار وانها ترافقت مع احدى العصور الجليديه الى سادت الارض وكانت ذات مياه عذبه. اما بحيره اللسان فقد كانت مياهها عذبه احيانًا ومالحه في احيان اخرى حسب رطوبه الجو. وهي اكبر المسطحات المائيه التي شغلت منخفض الاغوار حيث وصل طولها الى 220 كم.\n\nومع نهايه بحيره اللسان حدثت فتره جفاف قبل 14 الف سنه، والتي ادت الى جفاف معظم المسطحات المائيه في منطقه الاغوار وهي متطابقه مع اخر عصر جليدي في فتره بحيره داميه. ومع نهايه بحيره داميه تشكّل البحر الميت الحالي قبل 11 الف سنه، وقد كان مستوى سطحه يتعرض الى تذبذب سببه الظروف الطبيعيه الناتجه عن التقلبات المناخيه الى ان تحول التقلب في مستوى سطح البحر الميت الى عوامل بشريه ناتجه عن تحويل مصادر تغذيه البحر الميت بالمياه واهمها نهر الاردن، واقامه السدود المائيه على الاوديه التي ترفد البحر الميت بالمياه حتى انخفضت كميه المياه الوارده الى البحر الميت من 1200 مليون متر مكعب قبل عام 1960 الى اقل من 300 مليون متر مكعب في الوقت الراهن.\nوقد وُصف البحر الميت في الكثير من الخرائط والمواقع الدينيه اليهوديه والمسيحيه، حيث تُعد خارطه مادبا الفسيفسائيه اهم تلك الخرائط. وهي جزء من ارضيه لكنيسه قديمه في مدينه مادبا في الاردن، تعود الى العصر البيزنطي. وهي اقدم خريطه اصليه للاراضي المقدسه، والتي يعود انشاؤها الى سنه 560. توجد اليوم داخل كنيسه القديس جوارجيوس في مدينه مادبا، والتي بُنيت في عام 1896 فوق بقايا الكنيسه البيزنطيه. تمتد خريطه مادبا على جزء من ارضيه الكنيسه، وتُقدر ابعادها بنحو 15.75 عرضا 5.60 طولا، وتشكل مدينه القدس مركزا لها. وتظهر فيها مواقع في فلسطين والاردن وسوريا ولبنان ومصر.\nوتوجد على شواطئ البحر الميت منطقه تاريخيه مهمه، هي خربه قمران، وهي موقع اثري صغير الحجم، يقع على مقربه بضع كيلو مترات جنوبي اريحا في فلسطين. اكتسب شهرته العالميه بسب عثور مخطوطات البحر الميت فيه، وقبل العثور على المخطوطات لم يكن معروفاً الا عند القليل من علماء الاثار. وكانت اول زياره للموقع من قبل علماء الاثار في اواخر القرن العشرين. وقد بدات الحفريات هناك في عام 1950، وكانت عباره عن تنقيبات تجريبيه. وتضم هذه المخطوطات مايزيد على 970 قطعه مخطوطه، بعضها مما سمي لاحقا الكتاب المقدس وبعضها من كُتب لم تكن تعرف او كانت مفقوده. اول من عثر عليها راعيان من بدو التعامره المتجولين، كما تم اكتشاف المزيد بين عامي 1947 و1956 في 11 كهفًا في وادي قمران. وقد اثارت المخطوطات اهتمام الباحثين والمختصين بدراسه نص العهد القديم لانها تعود لما بين القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد والقرن الاول منه.\n\nاستكشاف البحر\nبدا الاهتمام الغربي باستكشاف نهر الاردن والبحر الميت في اواسط القرن التاسع عشر، وذلك من خلال بعثه امريكيه برئاسه الضابط وليم فرانسيس لنش، الذي زار المنطقه في عام 1848 لاهداف اقتصاديه وعلميه ودينيه. وتنبع اهميه هذه البعثه من كونها اول بعثه امريكيه ناجحه ارسلت الى حوض الاردن والبحر الميت، حيث ابدى لنش اهتمامًا واضحًا بالمنطقه، وذلك بدراسه امكانياتها المائيه والمعدنيه، كما دعى الى توطين اليهود في الاردن وفلسطين، قبل اكثر من قرن ونصف.\nلم تكن بعثه لنش البعثه الغربيه الاولى الى منطقه نهر الاردن والبحر الميت، حيث زار الايرلندي كرستوفر كوستغان وادي الاردن في عام 1835، لكنه مات بعد دخوله البحر الميت. وقبل مجيء لنش بقليل، وتحديداً في عام 1847، زار الانجليزي توماس مولينكس، من البحريه الملكيه البريطانيه المنطقه، لاستكشاف البحر الميت، لكنه مات بعد اسبوعين من اتمام مهمته. ويظهر ان لنش كان مدركاً للصعوبات والاخطار التي مر بها سابقوه، لذلك نزل في مدينه عكا على الشاطئ الشمالي لفلسطين في 4 نيسان/ ابريل 1848، حيث احاط السكان المحليون بالبعثه الامريكيه، وقطع بعدها لنش ورفاقه مسافه 25 ميلاً من شاطئ البحر المتوسط عبر الجليل في خمسه ايام.\n\nبدا لنش رحلته من بحيره طبريا عبر نهر الاردن الى البحر الميت. حيث استغرقت الرحله ثلاثه شهور (نيسان - حزيران 1848). وبعد وصول لنش للبحر الميت في نيسان 1848، اثّرت طبيعه التربه ومنظرها العام في نفسه سلبًا، على الاهتمامات المستقبيه للمنطقه، فالملح الخارج عن البحر الميت مغطيًا الحجاره، وطبيعه النباتات في المنطقه تشكّل نقاطاً لتساؤلات مفيده. كما راى ان المساحات المحيطه بوادي الاردن وخاصه على الجانب الشرقي منه كانت جافه وصلبه. وخلال جوله لنش في البحر الميت التي استمرت ثلاثه اسابيع رسم بعض الخرائط لشواطئ البحر، واستكشف المرتفعات المحيطه به.\nمن جانب اخر، اكتشف العلماء مؤخرًا العشرات من ينابيع المياه العذبه على طول ساحل البحر الميت وعلى عمق من 30 - 100 قدم تحت قعر البحر. اهميه هذا الاكتشاف تنبع في فهم اكثر للتوازن البيئي للبحر الميت. وقد وجد العلماء العديد من الحفر كل منها بعرض حوالي 10 امتار في الجزء السفلي للبحيره، وهي مغطاه بطبقه رقيقه وغريبه من انواع بكتيريه جديده.\n\nاهميه دينيه\nارتبط البحر الميت تاريخيّا بقصه قوم لوط التي ذُكرت كثيرًا في الكتب السماويه. ولوط هو ابن اخ النبي ابراهيم. هاجر لوط وابراهيم من العراق الى الشام في القرن التاسع عشر قبل الميلاد. وقوم لوط هم من اصل عربي قحطاني اصولهم تعود الى الجزيره العربيه، سكنوا منطقه جنوب البحر الميت بعد الهجره العربيه الاولى التي خرجت من الجزيره العربيه باتجاه الشمال، وتحديدًا بلاد الشام.\nوكان هؤلاء القوم معروفين بممارسه اللواط. وقد ذكرت الكتب السماويه قصتهم بعد ان سئم لوط منهم ويئس من هدايتهم، فتعرضوا لعذاب ادى الى تدمير قراهم الخمس عن بكره ابيها. ووردت قصتهم في القران سبعه وعشرين مره في 14 سوره مختلفه.\nولقد ورد البحر الميت في الانجيل تحت مُسمّيات مختلفه مثل «بحر الملح» و«بحر العربه» و«البحر الشرقي» وغيرها. كما وردت قصه لوط في التوراه في عده مواضع من سفر التكوين.\n\nالحياه البريه\nتتميز مناطق غور الاردن (من بحيره الحوله جنوباً الى جنوب البحر الميت) عن غيرها بالمناخ شبه المداري وقله حدوث الصقيع، مما يسمح لنباتات استوائيه وشبه استوائيه بالنمو. اُدخلت نباتات مثل النخيل والموز والحمضيات. من امثله النباتات البريه في هذه المناطق الغاب العملاق في مناطق المجاري المائيه والوديان. تتميز منطقه النقب ببعض الانواع التي تعد امتداداً للغطاء النباتي في افريقيا. من هذه الانواع العشار الباسق (باللاتينيه: Calotropis procera) واربعه انواع من السنط احدها السنط الملتوي (باللاتينيه: Acacia tortilis). وتشتهر منطقه البحر الميت باحتوائها على نمط النباتات الملحي، والذي ينتشر ايضًا حول واحات الازرق، وغور الاردن. وتختلف نباتات هذه المناطق باختلاف درجه ملوحتها وبالتالي قدره النبات على تحمل الملوحه. ومن نباتات هذا النمط الغرقد والاثل. كما تحوي المنطقه على نمط الغابات الاستوائي، ومعظم الغطاء النباتي في هذا النمط قد تعرض للتدمير بسبب انتشار الزراعه المكثف. وتعتبر نباتات السدر والطلح من اهم نباتات هذا النمط.\n\nكذلك، توجد اجناس نباتيه تتواجد في معظم البيئات الشاميه المذكوره اعلاه مثل السوسن الذي ينتشر منه اكثر من ثلاثين نوعًا تتوزع على مختلف مناطق الشام حسب تاقلم كل نوع منها. كذلك ينتشر اكثر من خمسين نوعًا من جنس الثوم (الفصيله الثوميه) واربعين من القنطريون (الفصيله النجميه) في مناطق الشام المختلفه من مرعش الى سيناء. هناك ايضًا اكثر من ستين نوعًا من جنس السيلينه من الفصيله القرنفليه تنتشر في مختلف المناطق وسبعه وثلاثون نوعا من الاربيان من الفصيله النجميه. وينتشر ايضًا في هذه المنطقه نبات قتاد البحر الميت، وهو نوع نباتي عشبي من جنس القتاد.\nويقع على الجانبين الشرقي والغربي من البحر الميت عدد من المحميات الطبيعيه التي تحوي تنوعًا كبيرًا في الكائنات الحيه المختلفه. وتُعد محميه الموجب الممتده بين محافظه مادبا ومحافظه الكرك في الاردن من اهم تلك المحميات، حيث يعيش فيها العديد من الحيوانات البريه مثل الماعز الجبلي وهو نوع من الماعز، الغزال الجبلي، الذئب، الوبر، والضبع المخططه، والقطط البريه مثل الوشق النادر الوجود في الاردن والنموس وغيرها. كما توجد في المحميه انواع كثيره من الطيور بلغ عدد انواعها اكثر من 150 من بين المحليه والمهاجره منها الشنار والسفرج والقبره المتوجه والابلق الحزين والسواديه والبلبل والغراب المروحي الذنب مثل الرخمه المصريه، وعقاب الباديه والعويسق وعقاب بونيللي.\n\nالسكان\nتشير المصادر التاريخيه، الى ان تاريخ الاستيطان البشري في منطقه البحر الميت وتحديدًا الجزء الجنوبي منه يمتد الى الالف الثالث قبل الميلاد. حيث كان مركزا حضاريًا في الفتره التاريخيه من 3300 ق.م الى 2300 ق م. وقد اُستدل على ذلك من خلال الحفريات التي اُجريت في منطقه غور المزرعه، وتحديدًا باب الذراع، حيث عُثر هنالك على اكبر مقبره في الشرق القديم والتي يعود تاريخها الى اقدم من خمسه الاف عام في العصر البرونزي المبكر. وفي الالف الثاني قبل الميلاد، وتحديدًا في 1900 ق. م. كانت منطقه الحوض الجنوبي تعج بالحضاره، وهي الفتره ذاتها التي عاش فيها لوط حسب معظم المصادر التاريخيه. وكان فيها خمسه مدن مزدهره هي: سدوم، عموره، زغر، ادمه، وصوبيم. وشهدت في تلك المرحله خسف ودمار لتلك الحضارات. وقد تم الاستشهاد بما نزل من ايات القران، وبعض الكتب المقدسه واراء الكثير من المفسرين وربط ذلك مع التاريخ الجيولوجي لمنطقه البحر الميت.\nالمجتمع المحلي\n\nيعيش اليوم على الجانب الشرقي من البحر الميت حوالي 70,000 نسمه، يتركز معظمهم في بلدات فيفا وغور الصافي ومدينه البوتاس والكفرين. بالاضافه الى الالاف من الذين يعملون في الصناعه والسياحه في محافظتي الكرك ومادبا. يوجد في منطقه غور الصافي نشاط زراعي واسع، حيث يجذب بعض العماله. ويتركز النشاط السياحي في الجزء الشمالي الشرقي حيث تتركز الفنادق الاردنيه. ويعمل في هذا القطاع حوالي 20 ٪ من المشتغلين في تلك المنطقه. كما توظف المصانع الكيماويه حوالي 20 ٪ منهم، اما الباقي فيعمل في قطاع الخدمات. وتخضع المنطقه الشرقيه للبحر الميت لسلطه وادي الاردن.\nويشكل لواء الاغوار الجنوبيه التابع لمحافظه الكرك الاردنيه جزءاً كبيرًا من هذه المنطقه، والذي يتجاوز عدد سكانه المقيمين اقامه دائمه 49,000 نسمه حسب احصائيات دائره الاحوال المدنيه والجوازاتفي الاردن للعام 2008. وهم يعتمدون على الزراعه بالدرجه الاولى بحكم الطبيعه الجغرافيه للمنطقه. ويُقدر عدد العاملين في هذا القطاع بحوالي 60% من السكان ذكورًا واناثًا. وتعد الصافي من اكبر التجمعات السكانيه.\nاما على الجانب الغربي، فيعيش في المنطقه الشماليه الغربيه، وتحديدًا بالقرب من اريحا وضواحيها 25,000 نسمه. ويعمل سكان هذه المنطقه بشكل اساسي في الزراعه والخدمات. كما يوجد عدد من المستوطنات الاسرائيليه على هذا الجانب يسكنها حوالي 2,500 نسمه، وتديرها المجالس الاقليميه المحليه، ويبلغ عدد هذه المستوطنات 12 مستوطن وتجمع سكني. هذا بالاضافه الى البدو الذين ياتون في كل يوم لمنطقه اريحا من عراد والقدس وديمونه وبئر السبع. تشغل السياحه الجزء الاكبر من عمل الموظفين في الجزء الغربي من البحر الميت، حيث يعمل فيها حوالي 5,000 موظف. اما الباقي، فيعملون في الزراعه والخدمات.\n\nالاقتصاد\nبدا البحر الميت في بدايات القرن العشرين بجذب اهتمام الكيميائيين الذين استنتجوا بدورهم ان البحر يحوي ثروات طبيعيه مهوله من البوتاس (كلوريد البوتاسيوم) والبروم. لذا، قامت شركه البوتاس الفلسطينيه في عام 1929 بتاسيس اول مصنع ينتج البوتاس في الساحل الشمالي للبحر الميت، حيث كان الانتاج يتم عبر التبخير الشمسي في المحاليل المائيه. وكان يعمل في المصنع عمّال عرب ويهود، حيث كان كواحه سلام في اوقات عصيبه. وفي عام 1934 قامت الشركه بتاسيس مصنعها الثاني في الساحل الجنوبي قرب جبل سدوم، الا انها تضررت كثيرًا بفعل احداث النكبه عام 1948.\nتم اغلاق المصنع الواقع في شمال البحر الميت في الضفه الغربيه بعد حرب 1948، وقد تم تفكيكه من قبل عصابه البالماخ الصهيونيه قبل انسحابها. كما تمت اعاده تشغيل العمليات في مصنع سدوم بالجنوب في عام 1952، والذي استمر حتى وقتنا الحاضر. لقد استولت اسرائيل على بقايا شركه البوتاس الفلسطينيه المحدوده بعد تاسيسها، وقد تم تاسيس شركه اخرى بدلاً عنها مملوكه للدوله في عام 1952 لاستخراج البوتاس وغيره من المعادن من البحر الميت. وقد تمت خصخصه الشركه في عام 1995، وهي مملوكه حاليًا لشركه كيماويات اسرائيل.\nيمتد الساحل الفلسطيني على البحر الميت في الضفه الغربيه بحوالي 40 كم، الا ان الاقتصاد الفلسطيني لا يستفيد من الصناعات الكيماويه في البحر الميت بسبب اجراءات الاحتلال الاسرائيلي والمناطق المغلقه التي فرضتها اسرائيل بعد احتلالها للضفه الغربيه عام 1967. وتشير تقديرات البنك الدولي الى ان صناعه المواد الكيميائيه الفلسطينيه من البحر الميت يمكن ان تولد 918 مليون دولار للقيمه المضافه سنويًا، اي ما يعادل تقريبا كل مساهمه قطاع الصناعات التحويليه في الاراضي الفلسطينيه اليوم. كما تشير تقديرات البنك الدولي الى ان صناعه السياحه الفلسطينيه بالبحر الميت يمكن ان تولد 290 مليون دولار من العائدات سنوياً و2900 فرصه عمل. ومع ذلك، فان الفلسطينيون لا يستطيعون الحصول على تصاريح البناء للاستثمارات ذات الصله بالسياحه على البحر الميت بسب اجراءات الاحتلال الاسرائيلي. ويُعتبر البحر الميت ذخرًا استراتيجيًا للاقتصاد الفلسطيني، لما يحتويه على كميات من الاملاح والمعادن ذات القيمه العاليه، والتي تستولي عليها اسرائيل باستخراجها وبيعها، وتمنع اي نشاط اقتصادي فلسطيني في تلك المنطقه. وتُقدر الخسائر السنويه للاقتصاد الفلسطيني نتيجه عدم استغلاله لموارد البحر الميت بنحو 1.1 مليار دولار اي ما يعادل 13.6% من الناتج المحلي الاجمالي.\n\nاما على الجانب الاردني من البحر الميت، فقد تم تاسيس شركه البوتاس العربيه في عام 1956، والتي تنتج حوالي مليوني طن من البوتاس سنويًا، بالاضافه الى كلوريد الصوديوم والبرومين. يقع المصنع في غور الصافي، في لواء الاغوار الجنوبيه بمحافظه الكرك. ويجني الاردن من الصناعات المعدنيه في البحر الميت حوالي 1.2 مليار دولار (تعدال 4% من الدخل القومي للمملكه). ويقع على الشاطئ الاردني حوالي 5 فنادق كبرى مصنفه كخمسه او اربعه نجوم، ادخلت عوائد للمملكه في عام 2012 بحوالي 128 مليون دولار. وقد زار بانوراما البحر الميت 12 الف زائر في عام 2013.\nوقد بدا الاردن بانشاء منطقه البحر الميت التنمويه على بعد 55 كم من العاصمه عمّان لتقديم الفرص الاستثماريه لتطوير العقارات. تمتد المنطقه على حوالي 40 كم مربع على شواطئ الساحلين الشمالي والشرقي للبحر الميت، وتحيط بها الجبال والتضاريس المنحدره الى شرق وادي نهر الاردن الى الشمال. تتمتع المنطقه ببنى تحتيه جيده، وتتصل مع عمّان من خلال الطريق السريع الرئيسي اضافه الى اماكن الجذب السياحي. وتتركز الفرص الاستثماريه في قطاع السياحه والفندقه بتطوير فنادق دوليه من فئه خدمات اربع وخمس نجوم، وتطوير فنادق من فئه 3 نجوم، والمرافق والمنشات البيئيه والمجمعات السكنيه والخدمات المجتمعيه والمرافق الترفيهيه والمنتجعات والمطاعم ومراكز المؤتمرات والمعارض.\nاما بالنسبه لاسرائيل، فقد انتجت من المحلول الملحي للبحر الميت في عام 2001، حوالي 1,7 مليون طن من البوتاس، وحوالي 206,000 طن من البرومين، و44,900 طن من الصودا الكاويه، وحوالي 25,000 طن من معادن المغنيسيوم، وكلوريد الصوديوم. وتجني الشركات الاسرائيليه حوالي 3 مليارات دولار سنوياً من بيع معادن البحر الميت (في المقام الاول البوتاس والبروم) وغيرها من المنتجات المستمده من معادن البحر الميت. وتملك اسرائيل 15 فندقًا على طول ساحل البحر الميت الغربي. وكان لهذه الفنادق عوائد على الاقتصاد الاسرائيلي بلغت في عام 2012 حوالي 291 مليون دولار. معظم تلك الفنادق توجد في الجزء الجنوبي من الساحل الغربي.\n\nالسياحه\nتُعد منطقه البحر الميت من اهم المناطق السياحيه للاستشفاء البيئي على مستوى العالم، حيث تتميز بمجموعه من العوامل الطبيعيه ما جعلها تحظى بمركز تنافسي في المنطقه في مجال السياحه العلاجيه والاستشفاء نظرًا لما يتمتع به من خصائص مناخيه فريده سواءً بخلوّه من الرطوبه، وباحتوائه على عيون كبريتيه جعلته مؤهلاً لعلاج العديد من الامراض وخاصه الجلديه منها، والتي تنتشر بصوره كبيره، حيث يصل عدد المصابين بها في اوروبا الى 25 مليون مريض، اضافهً الى علاج الروماتويد، وبذلك امتلكت منطقه البحر الميت عناصر مهمه للجذب السياحي ليس فقط في سياحه الاستشفاء، ولكن بتميزه ايضًا في سياحه الترفيه والسياحه البيئيه. ان اختيار منطقه البحر الميت من خلال منظمه الصحه العالميه كمركز عالمي لعلاج الكثير من الامراض الجلديه في عام 2011، يدل على اهميه المنطقه في مجال السياحه العلاجيه. وتعتمد العديد من الفنادق المقامه على ساحل البحر الميت على تقديم العلاج الطبيعي القائم على الاستفاده من الخصائص الطبيعيه المميزه للمنطقه دون استخدام اي ادويه كيماويه على الاطلاق. وتؤكد العديد من الدراسات ان منطقه البحر الميت بامتلاكها هذه المزايا العلاجيه يمكنها تحقيق اكبر عائد مادي سياحي للاردن، حيث ان نسبه الاصابه بالامراض الجلديه يتراوح ما بين 1 : 3% من تعداد السكان.\nكما شهدت سياحه المؤتمرات في البحر الميت تطورًا ملحوظًا خلال الاونه الاخيره، واصبحت منطقه البحر الميت تختص بهذا النوع من السياحه، من خلال تنظيم المؤتمرات والندوات واللقاءات على كافه المستويات المحليه والاقليميه والعالميه، حيث تتولى جهات مختصه مهمه تنظيم هذه اللقاءات والمؤتمرات وتوفير خدمات لا تقتصر على الجانب الرسمي للمؤتمر، وانما تشتمل ايضًا على تقديم الخدمات السياحيه والترفيهيه للمشاركين. وقد قام الاردن بتاسيس شركه البحر الميت للمؤتمرات والمعارض في عام 2003 بمشاركه مجموعه من المستثمرين الاردنيين والعرب. فكانت باكوره مشاريع هذه الشركه هو انشاء مركز الملك الحسين بن طلال للمؤتمرات لاستضافه اهم الفعاليات والمؤتمرات الاقليميه والعالميه. ولقد ساهم هذا المشروع في وضع الاردن على الخارطه العالميه لملتقيات رجال الاعمال والاستثمار، حيث استضاف المركز المنتدى الاقتصادي العالمي لاكثر من مره.\nوينظّم الاردن سنويًا ماراثوناً للركض في البحر الميت بمشاركه الالاف من المواطنين والسيّاح انطلاقا من عمّان وانتهاءً بشاطئ عمّان السياحي المطل على البحر الميت. ويُقام هذا الحدث لدعم مرضى الدماغ والاعصاب في المملكه.\n\nكما تنتج مختبرات البحر الميت الكثير من مستحضرات التجميل المصنوعه من المعادن المستخرجه من طينه، حيث تتوفر في الاسواق في انحاء الاردن، او يمكن طلبها عبر شبكه الانترنت فيتم تسليمها الى اي مكان في العالم، لكي يتمكن الزوار من الاستمرار بالتمتع بفوائد البحر الميت، بعد عودتهم الى ديارهم بفتره طويله.\nمن جهه اخرى، خصصت الحكومه الاسرائيليه في 2012 مبلغ 220 مليون دولار لما اسمته «تطوير وتاهيل البحر الميت». وستغطي معظم الموازنه تطوير المنطقتين السياحيتين على البحر الميت والمسماتين «تامي زوهر» و«عين بوقيق» وما بينهما، فضلا عن تاهيل ومعالجه المناطق والبنى التحتيه التي تضررت او التي يخيم عليها الخطر. وعند انجاز المشروع، تتوقع الحكومه الاسرائيليه ان يرتفع عدد الغرف الفندقيه المعروضه من 4000 الى 6500. ويهدف المشروع الاسرائيلي، بشكل اساسي، الى تحويل البحر الميت الى احد المواقع السياحيه الرائده في العالم؛ وهو لا يمس من قريب او بعيد مشكله استنزاف المصانع الاسرائيليه للموارد الملحيه الطبيعيه في البحر، علما بان المصانع الاسرائيليه تستنزف سنويًا اكثر من 250 مليون متر مكعب من مياه البحر الميت.\n\nفي الثقافه الانسانيه\nعُرف البحر الميت في الكثير من ثقافات وحضارات شعوب المنطقه. وكان الفراعنه اول من التفت الى اهميته، وتحديدًا الملكه كليوباترا، فهي اول من اكتشف املاحه وخصائصه الشفائيه والعلاجيه للبشره وشدّ العظام والجلد وتنشيط الدوره الدمويه ومقاومه التجاعيد. كما كان حمام الطين احد وصفاتها للجمال، حيث كانت تصنع ذلك الحمام من الطين الماخوذ من البحر الميت، والذي اشتهر باحتوائه بوفره على المعادن التي تغذي البشره وتنشطها وتسهم في نعومتها وبريقها.\n\nوقد وُصف البحر الميت في الكثير من اللوحات الفنيه العالميه، كلوحه الفنان المجري تيفادار اثناء زيارته لفلسطين عام 1906، حيث ظهرت فيها مدينه القدس ومن خلفها البحر الميت. كما ذُكر البحر في عدد من الاعمال الادبيه، سواءً المحليه او العالميه. وتُعد قصيده «حجر كنعاني في البحر الميت» للشاعر الفلسطيني محمود درويش احد اهم تلك الاعمال الادبيه. من جهه اخرى، تُعد «قصائد البحر الميت» التي كتبها الشاعر الانجليزي سيمون ارميتاج من الاعمال الادبيه الغربيه المهمه في هذا الخصوص. وقد استوحاها من النتائج التي توصل اليها علماء الاثار من مخطوطات البحر الميت، والتي اكتشفها راعي ماعز في عام 1947، كما عكست تجارب الشاعر وتجذرها في حياته الخاصه. وتتكون القصيده من 11 موشحه، معظمها يتكون من 3 اسطر، ويتكون المقطع الشعري الاخير من مجرد نصف سطر.\n\nانظر ايضًا\nقائمه اماكن حسب انخفاضها تحت مستوى البحر\nالبحيره المالحه الكبرى\nبحيره طبريا\nبحيره الحوله\nبحيره عسل\nاكتوبوس

          "summary": "البحر الميت هو بحيرة ملحية مغلقة تقع في أخدود وادي الأردن ضمن الشق السوري الأفريقي، على خط الحدود الفاصل بين الأردن وفلسطين التاريخية (الضفة الغربية والداخل المحتل). يشتهر البحر الميت بأنه أخفض نقطة على سطح الكرة الأرضية، حيث بلغ منسوب شاطئه حوالي 400 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر حسب سجلات عام 2013. كما يتميز البحر الميت بشدة ملوحته، إذ تبلغ نسبة الأملاح فيه حوالي 34%، وهي ما تمثل تسعة أضعاف تركيز الأملاح في البحر المتوسط، وواحدة من أعلى نسب الملوحة بالمسطحات المائية في العالم. وقد نتجت هذه الأملاح لأن البحيرة هي وجهة نهائية للمياه التي تصب فيه، حيث أنه لا يوجد أي مخرج لها بعده.\nيصل عرض البحر الميت في أقصى حد إلى 17 كم، بينما يبلغ طوله حوالي 70 كم. وقد بلغت مساحته في عام 2010 حوالي 650 كم2 إذ تقلصت خلال الأربع عقود الماضية بما يزيد عن 35%. كما يلعب المناخ الصحراوي للمنطقة الذي يمتاز بشدة الحرارة والجفاف ومعدلات التبخر العالية دورًا كبيرًا في زيادة تركيز تلك الأملاح فيه.\nلقد عانى منسوب البحر الميت مؤخرًا من التراجع المستمر، حيث يرجع هذا الأمر إلى عدد من الأسباب الرئيسية، كالاستخدام المكثف لمصادر المياه، وأهمها نهر الأردن، وضخ المياه في الحوض الجنوبي، حيث يتكون البحر الميت حاليًا من حوضين؛ شمالي وجنوبي يقسمهما شبه جزيرة اللسان. ونتيجة للانخفاض المستمر لهذا المستوى، تعرض الجزء الجنوبي من البحيرة للجفاف، حيث إنّ الجزء الجنوبي أقل عمقًا من نظيره الشمالي، ويصل ارتفاع منسوب شاطئه إلى 401 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر. ومع تجفيف الجزء الجنوبي، تم إنشاء برك لتبخير المياه وإنتاج البوتاس والمواد الكيماوية الأخرى مثل المنجنيز والمغنسيوم والبرومين في مصانع البوتاس الإسرائيلية، وشركة البوتاس العربية في الأردن. وتحتاج تلك البرك إلى ضخ كبير من مياه البحر الميت وتبخيرها، مما أثّر تأثيرًا كبيرًا على زيادة انخفاض مستوى سطح البحر.\nلقد بلغ المعدل السنوي لانخفاض مستوى سطح البحر خلال العقد المنصرم بمقدار يعادل الفقدان لمدة سنة كاملة، حيث أصبح المستوى ينخفض حوالي متر واحد كل عام. ولقد زاد هذا المعدل في عام 2012 بشكل واضح، فكان انخفاض مستوى البحر 1.40 متر. وقد أدى الانخفاض التراكمي في مستوى المياه إلى تغيرات كبيرة أيضا في تضاريس المناطق المجاورة وفي البحر الأبيض المتوسط بما في ذلك تغيرات لا يمكن الرجوع عنها في الجزء الشمالي، من خلق للمجاري، والانسحاب من الشواطئ، والأضرار التي لحقت بالبنية التحتية (الطرق والجسور) والمحميات الطبيعية.\nيُعد البحر الميت مهماً جدًا للصناعة والسياحة في المنطقة، حيث تُعتبر تركيبة مياهه مختلفة عن المياه الطبيعية، باحتوائها على تركيز عالي من الكالسيوم والبوتاسيوم. ويُستغل هذا في مصانع الجانبين الأردني والإسرائيلي. وترجع الأهمية التاريخية والسياحية لمنطقة حوض البحر الميت إلى البحر نفسه وإلى شواطئه، حيث توجد بعض المعالم الأثرية والدينية الهامة في المنطقة مثل مسعدة، وخربة قمران، وكهف النبي لوط، بالإضافة إلى التشكيلات الملحية الطبيعية، والمناخ السائد فيه، فكلها جعلت من البحر الميت نقطة جذب سياحية عالمية، وخصوصًا فيما يتعلق بالسياحة العلاجية. وتحوي المنطقة على آلاف الغرف الفندقية، حيث تتركز في الجزء الشمالي الشرقي في الأردن، بالإضافة إلى الجزء الغربي المطل على الحوض الجنوبي. وقد رُشح ليكون أحد عجائب الدنيا السبع الطبيعية في نطاق البحيرات.\nورغم أن دولة فلسطين لها جزء يطل على البحر الميت إلا أن السلطات الإسرائيلية لا تسمح للفلسطينيين باستغلال مواردهم من البحر، بل تمنعهم تماما من الذهاب إلى ساحل البحر الميت بحجة الأمن. وتشكل حقوق الفلسطينيين في استغلال نصيبهم من البحر الميت نقطة هامة في مباحثات السلام، بالإضافة إلى حقوقهم في مياه الشرب.",

          "content": "Kerak Castle (Arabic: قلعة الكرك, romanized: Qal'at al-Karak) is a large medieval castle located in al-Karak, Jordan. It is one of the largest castles in the Levant. Construction began in the 1140s, under Pagan and Fulk, King of Jerusalem. The Crusaders called it Crac des Moabites or \"Karak in Moab\", as it is referred to in history books. It was also colloquially referred to as Krak of the Desert.\n\nHistory\nCrusader period\nPagan the Butler was also Lord of Oultrejordain and Kerak Castle became the centre of his power, replacing the weaker castle of Montreal to the south. Because of its position east of the Dead Sea, Kerak Castle was able to control bedouin herders as well as the trade routes from Damascus to Egypt and Mecca. His successors, his nephew Maurice and Philip of Milly, added towers and protected the north and south sides with two deep rock-cut ditches (the southern ditch also serving as a cistern). The most notable Crusader architectural feature surviving is the north wall, into which are built immense arched halls on two levels. These were used for living quarters and stables, but also served as a fighting gallery overlooking the castle approach and for shelter against missiles from siege engines.\nIn 1176 Raynald of Châtillon gained possession of Kerak Castle after marrying Stephanie of Milly, the widow of Humphrey III of Toron (and daughter-in-law of Humphrey II of Toron). From Kerak Castle, Raynald harassed the trade camel trains and even attempted an attack on Mecca itself. In 1183 Saladin besieged the castle in response to Raynald's attacks. The siege took place during the marriage of Humphrey IV of Toron and Isabella I of Jerusalem, and Saladin, after some negotiations and with a chivalrous intent, agreed not to target their chamber while his siege machines attacked the rest of the castle. The siege was eventually relieved by Baldwin IV of Jerusalem.\nSaladin besieged Kerak again in 1184. Saladin attempted to fill the ditches that prevented siege engines from getting in range of the castle wall. However, just like the first siege of Kerak, Saladin and his men left before a reinforcing crusader army could come to the castle's aid. This siege only lasted four weeks.\nThe last siege of the 12th century was led by Sa’d Al-Din, Saladin's nephew, in 1188. Unlike the sieges before it, the Muslim army was not under the threat of crusader reinforcements. The year before Saladin had defeated an outnumbered crusader army at the Battle of Hattin and therefore the crusaders could not gather enough troops to reinforce Kerak. The Muslim army cut off supplies to the castle, and Kerak surrendered several months after. When the castle had fallen, it is believed that it was due to lack of arms, not a lack of food. With the fall of Kerak, the Castle of Montreal, which had been replaced as the centre of the lordship by Kerak, surrendered soon afterward.\n\nAyyubid period\nUnder the Ayyubid Dynasty, Kerak served as the administration centre for all of the regions of Jordan. When Saladin's brother, al-'Adil was awarded control of the castle, he made it the site of one of his treasuries. Kerak would continue to serve as the home of a royal treasury for the remainder of the Ayyubid Dynasty. During some internal conflict by members of the Ayyubid Dynasty in the 1230s and 40s, Kerak was one of the three princedoms that was able to remain independent. The castle was retaken by the Egyptian Sultan al- Salih Ayyub in 1249. Kerak was so important to the Ayyubids that it is recorded that only the governors of Kerak and Damascus were allowed to carry their official correspondences on red paper.\nUnder An-Nasir Dawud, much of the defenses of Kerak were expanded and improved in 1244-45. In 1227, the Sultan of Damascus al-Mu'azzam 'Isa, commissioned the construction of a tunnel that ran from the castle into the town.\n\nMamluk period\nIn 1263, the Mamluk Sultan Baibars enlarged and built a tower on the northwest corner. Under the Mamluks, Kerak continued to remain an important administrative centre. Ibn 'Abd al-Zahir stated that the castle held four ministries: the ministry of the army, the ministry of finance, the ministry of Kerak and the chancery. Due to the castle's importance, it also maintained a significant military force, which under the rule of al-Mughith, contained at least 700 horsemen.\n\nOttoman period\nDuring the Ottoman Empire, it played an important role due to its strategic location on the crossroads between the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt and the region of Syria.\nIn 1834, the leaders of the peasants' revolt in Palestine took refuge in Kerak. Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt besieged the castle, and destroyed much of its fortifications in the process.\nIn 1893, the Ottoman authorities reestablished control over the area by appointing a mutasarrıf (governor) resident in Kerak Castle with a garrison of 1400, including 200 cavalry. Parts of the castle were reused. Some of the destruction that had occurred to the structure was due to locals removing stones containing potassium nitrate (\"saltpetre\"), which is used to make gunpowder. Medieval historian Paul Deschamps studied Crusader castles in the 1920s. Amongst the important research done by Deschamps, in 1929 he and architect François Anus created the first accurate plans of Kerak Castle.\n\nJordan\nOn December 18, 2016, the castle was the site of a terrorist attack. Fourteen people were killed and 34 were injured, the majority being Jordanian security forces and local civilians. A Canadian tourist was also killed.\n\nArchitecture\nType and fortification\nKerak Castle is an example of one of the first castles built by the Franks that used a fortified tower structure and is a notable example of Crusader architecture, a mixture of west European, Byzantine, and Arab designs. Many early Frankish castles that predate Kerak were merely towers built along the crusader states during the early years of crusading. In the second half of the twelfth century, the growing Muslim threat made crusaders update their castle design and prioritize defensive elements.\nWhile Kerak Castle is a large and strong castle, its design is less sophisticated than that of concentric crusader castles like Krak des Chevaliers, and its masonry is comparatively crude. Many of its defenses were destroyed and rebuilt during its conquest by the Ayyubids and Mamluks.\nKerak Castle is a prime example of a spur castle, a castle built on top of a mountain to take advantage of the natural topography, as it is built on the southern end of a plateau surrounded on three sides by steep hills. This had the advantage during a siege of concentrating an attack on only one side of the castle, so the defenders could locate most of their manpower there.\nThe castle also used man-made fortifications, including ditches and thick stone walls. Because Muslim armies started to move with siege weapons such as siege engines, Frankish castles started adapting by building thicker and more solid walls. A \"Byzantine ditch\", a ditch or moat to keep siege engines at a safer distance, was constructed near the castle. There is another ditch near the town which is much deeper but less wide, to the west of the castle (now almost completely filled-in). It also has a glacis, an artificial slope made of steep, slippery masonry at the base of the walls that hindered attackers in their attempt to climb the walls and kept them exposed for longer to the defenders.\n\nStonework\nThe crusaders used rough-shaped volcanic stone to build large walls around the perimeter of the castle. After Sa'd al-Din captured Kerak, the Muslims used limestone from nearby quarries to repair and expand the castle. Both the Muslim and Christian stonework show signs of draft masonry, stone blocks which are smooth on the edges, but the centre portion is left rough and raised.\n\nTowers\nThe castle walls are strengthened with rectangular projecting towers, pointing to the fact that it was one of the earlier castles constructed by crusaders, it was only later on in the crusades that the transition to round towers in the curtain wall was made to help with visibility. At Kerak, the towers are much closer together than at other castles, theoretically to help with visibility problems. The towers were also placed at regular points along the wall; this is called the Byzantine tower structure—the square towers at Kerak are identical to the ones used by the Byzantine empire.\n\nChapel\nA chapel was built on the east side of the castle, about half-way along the length of the curtain wall.\n\nPresent day\nWhile Kerak Castle had historically been used to protect the assets of crusader states in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, today its job is much more mundane. The city bordering on Kerak Castle is home to roughly 170,000 people and is a \"lively tourist destination.\" Many people travel along the ancient King's Highway to stop at Kerak on their way to other tourist sites. in 1985 the World Heritage Committee decided that Kerak should not be an UNESCO site as there were \"more representative examples of crusader castles\". This is in part because the castle is not in the best condition and there are multiple examples of crusader castles in the Transjordan that are in better repair.\nIn December 2016, Kerak was the target of a terrorist attack that left 14 dead, including two civilians and a Canadian citizen. It is said that after clashing with police, the terrorists withdrew into the castle and held civilian hostages. There are not many references to Kerak Castle in popular-culture today, however it did play a large role in the 2005 film Kingdom of Heaven.\nThe nearby Al Karak Archaeology Museum introduces the local history and archaeology of the region around Kerak Castle – the land of Moab – from prehistory until the Islamic era. The history of Crusaders and Muslims at Kerak Castle and town is introduced in detail. Originally located in the castle's Lower Court, the museum moved in 2019 to an historic Ottoman building just outside the castle and facing the main castle wall.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of castles in Jordan\nWu'ayra Castle (li Vaux Moysi), an outpost of Montreal near Petra\n\nNotes\nReferences\n\nKennedy, Hugh (1994).

          "content": "Ajloun Castle (Arabic: قلعة عجلون, romanized: Qalʻat 'Ajloun), medieval name Qalʻat ar-Rabad, is a 12th-century Muslim castle situated in northwestern Jordan. It is placed on a hilltop belonging to the Mount Ajloun district, also known as Jabal Auf after a Bedouin tribe which had captured the area in the 12th century. From its high ground the castle was guarding three wadis which descend towards the Jordan Valley. It was built by the Ayyubids in the 12th century and enlarged by the Mamluks in the 13th.\n\nNames\nThe name Ajloun goes back to a Christian monk who lived on this mountain in the Byzantine period.\nThe castle has been the nucleus of a settlement which has grown to become the present town of Ajloun. The castle's developing faubourg led to its second name, Qalʻat ar-Rabad, \"the castle of the faubourg\" or \"the castle with the suburbs\". This name still resonates in the surname of a large and reputable Christian family owning most of the agricultural lands in the direct vicinity of the castle until this day, the Al-Rabadis.\n\nHistory\nByzantine monastery\nAjloun Castle is located on the site of an old monastery, traces of which were discovered during archaeological excavations. Tradition has it that the name Ajloun goes back to a Byzantine-period monk who lived in the area.\n\n12th-century Ayyubid castle\nPurpose\nIt was rebuilt as a castle in 1184 by Izz al-Din Usama, a general in the army of Saladin. The castle controlled traffic along the road connecting Damascus and Egypt. According to Saladin's historian Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad, the fortress was primarily built in order to help the authorities in Damascus control the Bedouin tribes of the Jabal 'Auf. These enjoyed enough autonomy as to ally themselves to the Crusaders, and had at one point set up a 100-tent camp next to the Hospitaller castle of Belvoir on the opposite side of the Jordan Valley. As such, Ajloun Castle is one of the very few Muslim fortresses built by the Ayyubids to protect their realm against Crusader incursions, which could come from Beisan or Belvoir in the west and from Karak in the south.\nFrom its location, the fortress dominated a wide stretch of the northern Jordan Valley, controlled the three main passages that led to it (Wadi Kufranjah, Wadi Rajeb and Wadi al-Yabis), and protected the communication routes between southern Jordan and Syria. It was built to contain the progress of the Latin Kingdom, which with the Lordship of  Oultrejordain had gained a foothold in Transjordan, and as a retort to the castle of Belvoir a few miles south of the Sea of Galilee. Another major objective of the fortress was to protect the development and control of the iron mines of Ajloun.\n\nOriginal outline\nThe original castle had four corner towers connected by curtain walls and a double gate. Arrow slits were incorporated in the thick walls and it was surrounded by a moat averaging 16 meters (about 52 feet) in width and 12–15 meters (about 40–50 feet) in depth.\n\n13th century: expansion, Mongol destruction, restoration\nAfter Usama's death, the castle was enlarged in AD 1214–1215 by Aibak ibn Abdullah, the Mamluk governor. He added a new tower in the southeast corner and built the gate.\nThe castle lost its military importance after the fall of Karak in AD 1187 to the Ayyubids. In the middle of the 13th century AD, the castle was conceded to Yousef ibn Ayoub, emir of Aleppo and Damascus, who restored the northeastern tower and used the castle as an administrative center.\nIn 1260 AD, the Mongols destroyed sections of the castle, including its battlements. Soon after the victory of the Mamluks over the Mongols at Ain Jalut, Sultan ad-Dhaher Baibars restored the castle and cleared the fosse. The castle was used as a storehouse for crops and provisions. When Izz ad-Din Aibak was appointed governor, he renovated the castle as indicated by an inscription found in the castle's south-western tower.\n\nOttoman period\nDuring the Ottoman period, a contingent of fifty soldiers was set inside the castle. During the first quarter of the 17th century, the Lebanese Druze Prince Fakhr ad-Din al-Ma'ni II used it during his fight against Ahmad ibn Tarbay. He supplied the castle with a contingent and provided provisions and ammunition. In 1812, the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt found the castle inhabited by around forty people.\n\nEarthquakes and restoration\nTwo major destructive earthquakes struck the castle in 1837 and 1927. Recently, the Department of Antiquities of Jordan has sponsored a program of restoration and consolidation of the walls and has rebuilt the bridge over the fosse.\n\nTourism\nAjloun Castle is open for tourism. Many areas of the castle can be explored. Tourists in Jordan often visit the castle. Inside there is also a museum exhibition with many interesting artifacts from the various time periods of the region.\n\nAjloun Cable Car\nThe Ajloun Cable Car was inaugurated in June 2023, managed by the Jordan Free and Development Zones Group (JFDZ), in order to boost tourism and improve infrastructure.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of castles in Jordan\nGreat mosque Ajlun\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nDarwish, Nazmieh Rida Tawfiq (1990).

          "content": "Montreal (Arabic: مونتريال; Latin: Mons Regalis, Mont Real), or Qal'at ash-Shawbak (قلعة الشوبك) in Arabic, is a castle built by the Crusaders and expanded by the Mamluks, on the eastern side of the Arabah Valley, perched on the side of a rocky, conical mountain, looking out over fruit orchards below. The ruins are located next to the modern town of Shoubak in Jordan.\n\nName\nThe Crusaders, who wrote their chronicles in Medieval Latin, Old French and Occitan, mentioned the castle as Castrum Saboach or Scobach, or as Mons Regalis, Mont Real, and Monreal. The second set of variants translate to 'Royal Castle' or 'King's Castle'.\nThe Arabic name is spelled variously as Shobak, Shawbak, Shaubak, Shubek, etc. The word castle or fortress translates in Arabic to qal'a.\n\nExcavation history\nAs of 1994, the castle had never yet been fully excavated, but as of 2006 it was being investigated by an Italian archaeological team from the University of Florence.\n\nHistory\nThe castle was built in 1115 by Baldwin I of Jerusalem during his expedition to the area when he captured Aqaba on the Red Sea in 1116. Originally called 'Krak de Montreal' or 'Mons Regalis', it was named in honor of the king's own contribution to its construction (Mont Royal). The castle is located on a round hilltop site that is separated from the rest of the plateau of Edom, which along with the Moab formed the core of Oultrejourdain. Despite appearance, the Edom plain was a relatively fertile location, which made the site, along with its strategic importance, highly desirable. The castle was strategically important due to the fact that it also dominated the main passage from Egypt to Syria. This allowed whoever held the castle to tax not only traders, but also those who were on pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina. One of the major disadvantages of the site was the lack of a reliable source of water, an issue that the Crusaders encountered all over the Middle East. This problem was solved by the construction of a tunnel down the hill to two spring-fed cisterns. The tunnel allowed defenders to go and retrieve water without exposing themselves to any attackers.\nIt remained property of the royal family of the Kingdom of Jerusalem until 1142, when it became part of the Lordship of Oultrejordain. At the same time the center of the Lordship was moved to Kerak, a stronger fortress to the north of Montreal. Along with Kerak, the castle owed sixty knights to the kingdom. The first Lord of Oultrejordain was Philip of Nablus. It was held by Philip de Milly, and then passed to Raynald of Châtillon when he married Stephanie de Milly. Raynald used the castle to attack the rich caravans that had previously been allowed to pass unharmed. He also built ships there, then transported them overland to the Red Sea, planning to attack Mecca itself. This was intolerable to the Ayyubid sultan Saladin (Salah al-Din), who invaded the kingdom in 1187. After capturing Jerusalem, later in the year he besieged Montreal. During the siege the defenders are said to have sold their wives and children for food, and to have gone blind from \"lack of salt.\" Because of the hill Saladin was unable to use siege engines, but after almost two years the castle finally fell to his troops in May 1189, after which the defenders' families were returned to them. After its capture, Saladin awarded it to his brother, al-'Adil, who held it until after his brother's death in 1193. During negotiations between the Crusaders and the Ayyubids in 1218-19, the Ayyubids unwillingness to hand back over the ownership of Montreal and Kerak was a major reason the negotiations broke down. In 1261, the Mamluk Sultan Baybars, stormed the castle bringing it under the control of Egypt.\n\nStructure\nLittle remains of the original Crusader fortifications. Although it has never been fully excavated, it is known that there was a set of three walls, which partially remain. The most significant remains of the Crusader portions of the Crusader castle is the remains of a curtain wall that ran inside the later Muslim additions and two chapels. The towers and walls are decorated with carved inscriptions dating from 14th century Mameluke renovations, but the inside is in ruins. The pilgrim Thietmar, who saw the castle in 1217 after the Muslim conquest, referred to it as \"a most excellent fortress, surrounded by triple walls and as strong as any I have ever seen\". The external walls and towers are attributed to the patronage of the Mamluk sultan Lajin.\n\nSee also\nList of castles in Jordan\nWu'ayra Castle (li Vaux Moysi), an outpost of Montreal near Petra\n\nReferences\n\"The Crusades\" by Hans Mayer\n\"The Age of the Crusades: The Near East from the Eleventh Century to 1517\" by Peter Holt\n\nNotes",

          "content": "Qusayr 'Amra or Quseir Amra, sometimes also named Qasr Amra (Arabic: قصر عمرة, romanized: Qaṣr ‘Amrah, lit. 'small qasr of 'Amra'), is the best-known of the desert castles located in present-day eastern Jordan. It was built some time between 723 and 743, by Walid Ibn Yazid, the future Umayyad caliph Walid II, whose dominance of the region was rising at the time. It is considered one of the most important examples of early Islamic art and architecture.\nThe building is actually the remnant of a larger complex that included an actual castle, meant as a royal retreat, without any military function, of which only the foundation remains. What stands today is a small country cabin. The foundation has a simple layout with a rectangular audience hall, hydraulic structures, and a bathhouse. The bathhouse is also one of the oldest surviving remains of a hammam in the historic Muslim world.\nIt is most notable for the frescoes that remain mainly on the ceilings inside, which depict, among others, a group of rulers, hunting scenes, dancing scenes containing nude women, working craftsmen, the recently discovered \"cycle of Jonah\", and, above one bath chamber, the first known representation of heaven on a hemispherical surface, where the mirror-image of the constellations is accompanied by the figures of the zodiac.  This has led to the designation of Qusayr 'Amra as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  \nThat status, and its location along Jordan's major east–west highway, relatively close to Amman, have made it a frequent tourist destination.  A preservation project that began in 2010 involves both removing old maintenance attempts and implementing new ones to support the site better.\n\nLocation and access\nQusayr 'Amra is located on the north side of Jordan's Highway 40, roughly 85 kilometres (53 mi) from Amman and 21 kilometres (13 mi) southwest of Al-Azraq.\nIt is within a large area fenced off in barbed wire. A paved parking lot is located at the southeast corner, just off the road. A small visitor's center collects admission fees. The castle is located in the west of the enclosed area, below a small rise.\n\nDescription\nTraces of stone walls used to enclose the site suggest it was part of a 25-hectare (62-acre) complex; there are remains of a castle which could have temporarily housed a garrison of soldiers.\n\nJust to the southeast of the building is a well, 40 metres (130 ft) deep, and traces of the animal-driven lifting mechanism and a dam have been found as well.\nThe architecture of the reception-hall-cum-bathhouse is identical to that of Hammam al-Sarah, also in Jordan, except the latter was erected using finely-cut limestone ashlars (based on the Late Roman architectural tradition), while Amra's bath was erected using rough masonry held together by gypsum-lime mortar (based on the Sasanian architectural tradition).\nIt is a low building made from limestone and basalt. The northern block, two stories high, features a triple-vaulted ceiling over the main entrance on the east facade. The western wings feature smaller vaults or domes.\n\nHistory\nConstruction\nThe painting of the six kings includes King Roderick of Visgothic Kingdom, whose short reign (710–712) has been taken to date of the image, and possibly the building, to around 710. Therefore, for a long time researchers believed that sitting caliph Walid I was the builder and primary user of Qasr Amra, until doubts arose, making specialists believe that one of two princes who later became caliph themselves, Walid or Yazid, were the more likely candidates for that role. The discovery of an inscription during work in 2012 has allowed for the dating of the structure to the two decades between 723 and 743, when it was commissioned by Walid Ibn Yazid, crown prince under caliph Hisham and his successor during a short reign as caliph in 743–744.\nBoth princes spent long periods of time away from Damascus, the Umayyad capital, before assuming the throne. Walid was known to indulge in the sort of sybaritic activities depicted on the frescoes, particularly sitting on the edge of pools listening to music or poetry. He was once entertained by performers dressed as stars and constellations, suggesting a connection to the sky painting in the caldarium. Yazid's mother was a Persian princess, suggesting a familiarity with that culture, and he too was known for similar pleasure-seeking.\nKey considerations in the placement of the desert castles centered on access and proximity to the ancient routes running north from Arabia to Syria. A major route ran from the Arabian city of Tayma via Wadi Sirhan toward the plain of Balqa in Jordan and accounts for the location of Qusayr 'Amra and other similar fortifications such as Qasr Al-Kharanah and Qasr al-tuba.\n\nRediscovery in 1898\nThe abandoned structure was re-discovered by Alois Musil in 1898, with the frescoes made famous in drawings by the Austrian artist Alphons Leopold Mielich for Musil's book. In the late 1970s a Spanish team restored the frescoes. The castle was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985 under criteria i), iii), and iv) (\"masterpiece of human creative genius\", \"unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition\" and \"an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates a significant stage in human history\").\n\nConservation\nSince 1970, there have been multiple conservation projects undertaken at Qusayr 'Amra to address the state of the structure and the frescoes. The first was carried out by the Archaeological Museum of Madrid and spanned three years from 1971 to 1974. While the project involved some architectural restoration, it focused greatly on restoring the frescoes throughout the bathhouse. The frescoes were cleaned of soot, as well as covered with a layer of shellac to protect the paintings. However, this shellac was more damaging than protective, and was removed during a conservation project in 1996 carried out by the University of Granada. Over the years, the color of the shellac turned and covered the paintings. During and after the removal process, the shellac also caused some of the paint to come off of the wall.\n\nCurrent project\nIn 2010, a new conservation project began and is currently still active. This project has been conducted by the World Monuments Fund, the Italian Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro, and the Department of Antiquities of Jordan. While this project works on the bathhouse itself as well as restoring the frescoes, it makes a point to also focus on the architecture outside of the bathhouse, such as the qasr, saqiya, and watch tower, which have not been conserved, since previous projects focused mainly on the frescoes and interior of the bathhouse. The conservation efforts began with documentation of the state of the paintings, frescoes, and the building. Lime mortar was applied to parts of the structure that were showing signs of leaking water and loss of original mortar. Additionally, windows and ceiling covers were added to prevent water from entering the bathhouse and to protect it from outside conditions. Removal of more shellac and cleaning of the paintings and frescoes revealed rich colors that had not been visible before.\n\nFrescoes\nQusayr 'Amra is most notable for the frescoes on the inside walls. The frescoes are not only appreciated for their artistic value, but also for their role as markers of the birth and evolution of Islamic Art, especially during the Umayyad Period. The frescoes depict a wide variety of scenes including: hunting scenes, bathing scenes, animals, vegetal motifs, mythological figures, and religious scenes.\n\nReception hall\nThe main entry vault has scenes of hunting, fruit and wine consumption, and naked women. Some of the animals shown are not abundant in the region but were more commonly found in Persia, suggesting some influence from that area. One surface depicts the construction of the building. Near the base of one wall a haloed king is shown on a throne. An adjoining section, now in Berlin's Museum of Islamic Art, shows attendants as well as a boat in waters abundant with fish and fowl.\n\nWest Aisle\nThe story of Jonah and the whale is depicted four times in the frescoes of the west aisle; these are the earliest known images of Jonah in Islamic art. It is difficult to tell whether they illustrate the story as told in the Quran or in the Bible, since these two tellings are very similar. The inclusion of amphorae in the frescoes puts them closer to the Biblical version, but this detail could indicate that the artists based their pictures on third-party models rather than working directly from religious texts. In the Quran, Jonah had many roles and was often seen as an example of good and bad behavior as well as a spiritual leader. The inclusion of multiple images of Jonah in the bathhouse alludes to its builder's belief in a predestined right to rule, since Jonah was divinely appointed as a leader. Al-Walid was greatly focused on legitimacy, especially that coming from God, and the connection he made between himself and Jonah enforces this idea.\nOn the north wall of the west aisle, there is a large fresco of a nude woman swimming. In this fresco, there are fish that appear to be swimming around the woman, and a large flower that is understood to be a lotus flower. It is not known who the woman represents, but due to the apparent classical and late Roman style of depicting her, a number of mythological persons have been suggested. Despite this, due to the imagery surrounding the woman, it is believed that this specific fresco depicts a Nilotic scene. There have been a number of visual connections made between the Nile and the River Jordan that could support this claim. The Nile specifically was understood to be a symbol of plenty and a provider of life, and this meaning, which when placed in the context of where in the bathhouse this fresco is located, connects to al-Walid's role as a ruler. Opposite this wall the fresco of al-Walid enthroned sits, and this contrast between the large fresco of al-Walid and the fresco of the woman swimming implies that as caliph, al-Walid saw himself as a provider of life to the people he ruled over.\n\nThrone apse\nAn image known as the \"six kings\" depicts the Umayyad caliph and the rulers of realms near and far. Based on details and inscriptions in the image, four of the depicted kings are identified as the Byzantine Emperor, the Visigothic king Roderic, the Sassanid Persian Shah, and the Negus of Ethiopia. The last one was for a long time unidentified, speculated to be the Turkish, Chinese, or Indian ruler, and now known to represent the emperor of China. Its intent was unclear. The Greek word ΝΙΚΗ nike, meaning victory, was discovered nearby, suggesting that the \"six kings\" image was meant to suggest the caliph's supremacy over his enemies. Another possible interpretation is that the six figures are depicted in supplication, presumably towards the Caliph who would be seated in the hall.\n\nBath\nThe frescoes in all rooms but the caldarium reflect the advice of contemporary Arab physicians. They believed that baths drained the spirits of the bathers, and that to revive \"the three vital principles in the body, the animal, the spiritual and the natural,\" the bath's walls should be covered with pictures of activities like hunting, of lovers, and of gardens and palm trees. There were a variety of themes and patterns throughout the frescos and mosaics. One aspect which can be seen through a majority of these mosaics is a focus on repeating and geometric shapes, colors, and patters. One of the major themes in this palace is water. One examples of this theme of water is a mosaic where the Triumph of the Roman god Neptune. This was the god of the sea and his presence accentuates the theme of water. These themes emphasize the water within the bathhouses.\n\nApodyterium\nThe apodyterium, or changing room, is decorated with scenes of animals engaging in human activities, particularly performing music. One ambiguous image has an angel gazing down on a shrouded human form. It has often been thought to be a death scene, but some other interpretations have suggested the shroud covers a pair of lovers. Three blackened faces on the ceiling have been thought to represent the stages of life. Christians in the area believe the middle figure is Jesus Christ.\n\nTepidarium\nOn the walls and ceiling of the tepidarium, or warm bath, are scenes of plants and trees similar to those in the mosaic at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. Out of the three frescoes depicting women bathing in Qusayr 'Amra, two are located in the tepidarium. These frescoes depict women carrying water buckets to bathe their children, and included imagery of erotes as well. These women are depicted completely in the nude, which was not uncommon since the Umayyads accepted depictions of nudity, and since this building is not a religious one, depictions of humans was also approved. These frescoes have clear Roman influence with not only the inclusion of the erotes, but also the Roman-esque backgrounds and the belief that the scenes depicted could be part of a Dionysiac infant cycle. It is accurate to say that the women depicted were most likely goddesses of some kind since women were not allowed to enter bathhouses. Additionally, men were only allowed to enter if they were covered, which is reflected by the images of men somewhat covered in the bathhouse, so depictions of nudity of women would only be acceptable if the subjects were not human. Since the frescoes only have a few figures, it made it so viewers could focus on them more and on what was happening in the scene. The scene of a woman pouring water over another person's head would have mimicked what occurred in the room and further connects the frescoes to the viewer.\n\nCaldarium\nThe caldarium or hot bath's hemispheric dome has a representation of the heavens in which the zodiac is depicted, among 35 separate identifiable constellations. It is believed to be the earliest image of the night sky painted on anything other than a flat surface. The radii emerge not from the dome's center but, accurately, from the north celestial pole. The angle of the zodiac is depicted accurately as well. Creating the fresco on the dome was technically difficult, however, based on evidence showing that the artist had to redo several parts, it was clear that he was very skilled and focused on accuracy. The only error discernible in the surviving artwork is the counterclockwise order of the stars, which suggests the image was copied from one on a flat surface.\n\nSee also\nHammam (Arabic bathhouse)\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\nList of World Heritage Sites in Jordan\nList of castles in Jordan\n Jordan portal\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nAlois Musil: Ḳuṣejr ʿAmra, Kaiserliche Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien, Wien : k.k.

          "summary": "Qusayr 'Amra or Quseir Amra, sometimes also named Qasr Amra (Arabic: قصر عمرة, romanized: Qaṣr ‘Amrah, lit. 'small qasr of 'Amra'), is the best-known of the desert castles located in present-day eastern Jordan. It was built some time between 723 and 743, by Walid Ibn Yazid, the future Umayyad caliph Walid II, whose dominance of the region was rising at the time. It is considered one of the most important examples of early Islamic art and architecture.\nThe building is actually the remnant of a larger complex that included an actual castle, meant as a royal retreat, without any military function, of which only the foundation remains. What stands today is a small country cabin. The foundation has a simple layout with a rectangular audience hall, hydraulic structures, and a bathhouse. The bathhouse is also one of the oldest surviving remains of a hammam in the historic Muslim world.\nIt is most notable for the frescoes that remain mainly on the ceilings inside, which depict, among others, a group of rulers, hunting scenes, dancing scenes containing nude women, working craftsmen, the recently discovered \"cycle of Jonah\", and, above one bath chamber, the first known representation of heaven on a hemispherical surface, where the mirror-image of the constellations is accompanied by the figures of the zodiac.  This has led to the designation of Qusayr 'Amra as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  \nThat status, and its location along Jordan's major east–west highway, relatively close to Amman, have made it a frequent tourist destination.  A preservation project that began in 2010 involves both removing old maintenance attempts and implementing new ones to support the site better.",

          "content": "Qasr al-Harrana (Arabic: قصر الحرَّانة), sometimes Qasr Harrana, Qasr al-Haranah, Haraneh, Hraneh, Harana, Qasr al-Kharana or Khauranee, is one of the best-known of the desert castles located in present-day eastern Jordan, about 60 kilometres (37 mi) east of Amman and relatively close to the border with Saudi Arabia. It is uncertain when the palace was constructed, but it likely originates from the Umayyad Dynasty. An inscription on an upper wall dates the building to before 710 CE. A Greek or Byzantine house may have existed on the site. The purpose of the building is a subject of debate among scholars. Theories as to the qasr's purpose include a Crusader's castle, a military stronghold, agricultural outpost, and resting place for caravan travelers. The current scholarly consensus is that the building was used as for meeting between local Bedouin leaders.\n\nDescription\nThe qasr is a nearly square building, 35 metres (115 ft) on each side, with three-quarter-round buttresses at the corners, a projecting rounded entrance on the south side with quarter-round buttresses, and half-round buttresses bisecting every other facade. It is made of rough limestone blocks set in a mortar. Decorative courses of flat stones run through the facing.\nOn the inside, the building has 60 rooms on two levels arranged around a central courtyard, with a rainwater pool in the middle. Many of the rooms have small slits for light and ventilation. Some of the rooms are decorated with pilasters, medallions and blind niches finished in plaster.\n\nLocation\nThe palace is located along the Al-Azraq Highway in a remote area of the Jordanian desert, isolated from human settlement. It is located about 65 kilometers (40 miles) east-south-east of Amman, Jordan, the capital city. The castle has an expansive view in all directions — twelve kilometers (7.5 miles) to the south, 30 kilometers (19 miles) to the west, several kilometers to the north, and the horizon is visible to the east. There were no additional buildings on the site.\nIt was built on top of a ridge which overlooks the Wadi al-Kharana. The wadi is the primary source of water for the palace. Simple well systems called thamail (singular thamila), an Arabic word meaning \"a place where water remains\", were used to draw water from the wadi. Thamail are pits dug into the gravel that rests upon the bedrock in the wadi, where they collect water. It is impossible to identify any thamail used during the period of construction or use of the palace, because these pits are periodically washed away by natural floods. However, the thamail in use today were likely comparable to the ones used by those who used the building. There is no evidence of wells or dams being built in order to provide a better water source than the thamail.\n\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the structure remains unclear today. In 1895, Sir John Edward Gray Hill, an English explorer, noted two deep cisterns that had apparently fallen out of use. Unfortunately, he didn't expand on this observation, and no one else has recorded the existence of any water storage apparatus, like dams or irrigation lines, besides thamail in the wadi bed. The small scale of water production and storage means it is unlikely that anyone depended on the building to support large groups, especially for long periods of time. This discounts the theories that the qasr was used as a caravanserai (a resting place for traders), an agricultural outpost, or a palace intended for recreation.\nEarly explorers assumed the palace was used as a military stronghold. This is very unlikely. Besides being unable to withstand a prolonged siege due to limited water supply, there is no evidence of battlements having existed, and the slits in the wall were intended for ventilation, not as arrow slits.\nNot much is known about trade routes in the greater Jordan area in the early Islamic period. It is believed that trade routes ran from Azraq north to Damascus, as well as from Azraq to Hallabat, then to Al-Muwaqqar and Amman. Qasr Kharana is located far from both of these routes, so it is unlikely that it was intended as a service point for caravan traders, since it is not only remote, but had little water to offer. While there were rooms used as stables, there is no evidence of large corral areas which would have been necessary for caravan groups. The building features no baths or decorative mosaics, so it is unlikely that the building was used as a palace for recreation. A possible function of the building is a meeting place for local Bedouin leaders. While it lacked the infrastructure to support long-term stays of large groups, it has stables, plenty of rooms, and a courtyard which would have been conducive to meetings.\n\nBuilding style, layout, techniques\nQasr Kharana combines different regional traditions with the influence of the then-new religion of Islam to create a new style. Syrian building traditions influenced the design of the castle, with Sassanid building techniques applied. The layout follows Syrian houses, themselves influenced by Byzantine and Roman customs. \n\nThe only entrance is on the south wall. On either side of the entrance are two quarter-round buttresses. Through the entrance is a 3.5 by 9.15 meter passageway which leads into the courtyard, which is 12.65 by 12.95 meters. The layout is largely composed of bayts, which are discrete groups of rooms. These bayts consist of rooms which are connected to each other by doorways, but are only connected to other rooms by the courtyard. On the east and west sides of the courtyard are bayts of eight rooms each, and on the north side is a suite of seven rooms. Each suite has a central room from which smaller rooms branch out. Each room that is adjacent to the courtyard has a doorway connecting it to the courtyard. On each side of the entrance passageway are larger halls of about 12.8 by 8 meters. The halls are divided into two areas by pillars and were likely used as stables and storage rooms.\n\nThere are two staircases leading up to the first floor, located at the southwest and southeast corners of the courtyard. Each staircase has two flights of stairs, with small landings halfway up. At the top of each staircase are three doors. One leads to the first floor of the portico, one leading to the rooms, and another to a corridor with stairs which lead up to the roof terrace. The south side of the first floor has two five-room bayts in each corner, with a large central room in between them. The rest of the first floor follows the layout of the ground floor pretty closely, although the rooms are not oriented exactly the same and the dimensions vary slightly from their ground floor counterparts.\nLike Sassanid buildings, the castle's structural system is transverse arches supporting barrel vaults. The site made it necessary to modify those building techniques slightly. The arches are not connected to the carrying wall, instead placed on bearing arms. The overall weight of the structure keeps these elements together. Some newer building materials, such as wooden lintels, were used, allowing the building to be more flexible and resist earthquakes.\nIslamic concepts of public and private were satisfied through the narrow slits offering views to (and from) the outside, larger windows on the inside and the north terrace separating the two apartments. A room on the south side was set aside for prayer.\nThe wall slits could not have been used by archers as they are the wrong height and shape. Instead they served to control dust and light and took advantage of air pressure differentials to cool the rooms, via the Venturi effect.\nThe architectural style and the decoration of the building show influences from Syrian, Parthian, and Sasanian traditions. Some scholars argue that structure was built during the Sasanian occupation of the area in 620s.\n\nHistory\nIn later centuries the castle was abandoned and neglected. It suffered damage from several earthquakes.\nHill published the first known written reference to the qasr in 1896. It is difficult to pin down the exact date of the palace's construction. There were several stages of construction. The first phase includes the entire ground floor and the western side of the first floor. The second phase includes rooms on the southern and eastern sides of the first floor. The third phase, which was not completed, includes the unfinished rooms in the northwest corner of the first floor.\nWhile it is unknown exactly when the structure was first built, we do have a terminus ante quem. In a large room on the west side of the first floor, there is a small inscription which states it was written on November 24, 710 CE. This inscription dates the end of the first phase of construction of the palace.\nThere are three Greek inscriptions, which are illegible. One hints at a military title, and another contains a “V” which may be a Roman numeral. These inscriptions point to the existence of more inscriptions which have since been lost or disfigured. The source of the stones which contain these inscriptions is unclear. While it is possible that there was a building at the site which predated the qasr, the stones may have also originated from markers in the desert. These three inscriptions are not enough evidence to confirm the existence of an earlier building.\nIn 1895, Hill visited the site. He gave a fairly accurate description of the palace, although he misread his compass and said the south entrance was on the east facade. He incorrectly labeled the ventilation slits in the walls to be arrow slits, as would have appeared in a military fortress. Hill identified some of the rooms in the first floor as “chapels with little Norman arches in the upper parts of the rooms, and Christian devices”. This led to his conclusion that the building was a Crusader's castle, “intended to be used as a stronghold and water store between Umm Moghr and Asrak”.\nAlois Musil, a Czech geographer, visited the site in 1898, 1900, and 1901. He was convinced that the building was used as a fortress. In an effort to justify this, he included battlements in his schematic drawings and baselessly claimed that they had been torn down so that their stones could be reused as weapons.\nIn 1922, Antonin Jaussen and Raphaël Savignac published a description of Qasr Harrana in their Mission archéologique En Arabie, which has been praised as a \"scholarly landmark\". In 1946, Nabia Abbott published a full translation and analysis of the inscriptions at Qasr Harrana. This was instrumental, as early explorers had been unable to translate the entire text. Her translation allowed the building to be dated to 710 CE at the latest.\nIn the late 1970s the palace was restored. During the restoration some changes were made. A door in the east wall was closed, and some cement and plaster was used that was inconsistent with the existing material. Stephen Urice wrote his doctoral dissertation on the castle, published as a book, Qasr Kharana in the Transjordan, in 1987 following the restoration.\n\nTourism\nQasr Harrana remains very well preserved, and is open to tourist visitors from 8 am to 6 pm from May to September, and 8 am to 4 pm the rest of the year. The area is fenced off with a visitors' center on the southeast corner, where the main entrance to the castle area is located. A paved driveway leads from the highway to a parking lot large enough for cars and several buses located just south of the entrance. The site is only accessible by one highway, and is not reached by public transportation. The castle is today under the jurisdiction of the Jordanian Department of Antiquities. The kingdom's Ministry of Tourism controls access to the site via the new visitor's center, charging an admission fee of JD 1 (US$1.42) to the site during daylight hours. A Bedouin merchant sells handcrafts and drinks in the parking lot. There is a plaque in Arabic and English near the main entrance. Visitors are free to explore the entire building. There is little data available concerning the number of visitors per year. The site has a 4.3/5 star rating on Google Maps  and a 4/5 star rating on Tripadvisor.\n\nSee also\nList of castles in Jordan\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nArchnet article – Qasr Kharana\n50 Pictures of this sight\nPhotos of Qasr Kharana at the American Center of Research\n\nPhotos of Qasr Kharana at the Manar al-Athar photo archive",

It is one of the desert castles,  located on the outskirts of present-day town of Azraq, roughly 100 km (62 mi) east of Amman.\nIts strategic value came from the nearby Azraq oasis, the only water source in a vast desert region. The name of the fortress and associated town came from the oasis. The settlement was known in antiquity as Basie and the Romans were the first to make military use of the site, and later an early mosque was built in the middle. The fortress did not assume its present form until an extensive renovation and expansion by the Ayyubids in the 13th century, using locally quarried basalt which makes the castle darker than most other buildings in the area.\nLater, it would be used by the Ottoman armies during that empire's hegemony over the region. During the Arab Revolt, T. E. Lawrence based his operations here in 1917–18, an experience he wrote about in his book Seven Pillars of Wisdom. The connection to \"Lawrence of Arabia\" has been one of the castle's major draws for tourists.\n\nArchitecture\nThe castle is constructed of the local black basalt and is a square structure with 80 metre long walls encircling a large central courtyard. In the middle of the courtyard is a small mosque that may date from Umayyad times. At each corner of the outer wall, there is an oblong tower. The main entrance is composed of a single massive hinged slab of granite, which leads to a vestibule where one can see carved into the pavement the remains of a Roman board game.\nAlthough very heavy — 1 ton for each of the leaves of the main gate, 3 tons for single the other — these stone doors can quite easily be moved, thanks to palm tree oil. The unusual choice of stone can be explained by the fact that there is no close source of wood, apart from palm tree wood, which is very soft and unsuitable for building.\n\nHistory\nThe strategic significance of the castle is that it lies in the middle of the Azraq oasis, the only permanent source of fresh water in approximately 12,000 square kilometres (4,600 sq mi) of desert. Several civilizations are known to have occupied the site for its strategic value in this remote and arid desert area.\nThe area was inhabited by the Nabataean people and around 200 CE fell under the control of the Romans. The Romans built a stone structure using the local basalt stone that formed a basis for later constructions on the site, a structure that was equally used by the Byzantine and Umayyad empires.\nQasr al-Azraq underwent its final major stage of building in 1237 CE, when 'Izz ad-Din Aybak, an emir of the Ayyubids, redesigned and fortified it. The fortress in its present form dates to this period.\nIn the 16th century the Ottoman Turks stationed a garrison there, and T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) made the fortress his desert headquarters during the winter of 1917, during the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. His office was in the chamber above the entrance gatehouse. It had an additional advantage in modern warfare: the flat nearby desert was an ideal place to build an airfield.\n\nAccording to Lawrence, \"Azrak lay favourably for us, and the old fort would be convenient headquarters if we made it habitable, no matter how severe the winter.  So I established myself in its southern gate-tower, and set my six Haurani boys...to cover with brushwood, palm-branches, and clay the ancient split stone rafters, which stood open to the sky.\"  Ali ibn el Hussein \"took up his quarters in the south-east corner tower, and made that roof tight.\"  The postern gate was shut each night, \"The door was a poised lab of dressed basalt, a foot thick, turning on pivots of itself, socketed into threshold and lintel.  It took a great effort to start swinging, and at the end went shut with a clang and crash which made tremble the west wall of the old castle.\"\nLawrence wrote of their first night, \"...when there rose a strange, long wailing round the towers outside.  Then the cries came again and again and again, rising slowly in power, till they sobbed round the walls in deep waves to die away choked and miserable.  Lawrence was told, \"...the dogs of the Beni Hillal, the mythical builders of the fort, quested the six towers each night for their dead masters...their ghost-watch kept our ward more closely than arms could have done.\"\n\nToday\nQasr al-Azraq is often included on day trips from Amman to the desert castles, along with Qasr Kharana and Qasr Amra, both east of the capital and reached via Highway 40. Visitors can explore most of the castle, both upstairs and downstairs, except for some sections closed off while the rock is shored up. There is little interpretive material at the moment.\n\nSee also\nDesert castles\nJordanian art\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nPhotos of Azraq Castle at the American Center of Research\nPhotos of Qasr al-Azraq at the Manar al-Athar photo archive",

          "content": "The Amman Citadel (Arabic: القلعة, romanized: al-Qal'a, lit. 'the Fortress') on Citadel Hill (Arabic: جبل القلعة, romanized: Jabal al-Qal'a, lit. 'Fortress Mount') is an archaeological site on an L-shaped hill towering over Downtown Amman, in the central part of the capital of Jordan. \nThe Amman Citadel is considered to be among the world's oldest continuously inhabited places. Evidence of inhabitance since the Neolithic period has been found and the hill was fortified during the Bronze Age (1800 BCE). The hill became the capital of the Kingdom of Ammon, sometime after 1200 BCE. It later came under the sway of major powers such as the  Assyrian,  Babylonian, Ptolemaic, Seleucid, Roman, Byzantine, and Umayyad empires. During classical antiquity the city expanded far beyond Citadel Hill, which was given the role of an acropolis. After the Umayyads came a period of decline and for much of the following millennium, the former city became an abandoned pile of ruins only sporadically used by Bedouins and seasonal farmers; this hiatus came to an end in 1878, when the Ottoman Empire resettled displaced Circassian refugees there.\nMost of the structures still visible at the site are from the Roman,  Byzantine, and  Umayyad periods. The major remains at the site are the Temple of Hercules, a Byzantine church, and the Umayyad Palace. The Jordan Archaeological Museum was built on the hill in 1951. While archaeological discoveries have been made at many sites within modern Amman, Citadel Hill still holds particularly high potential. Archaeologists have been working at the site since the 1920s, including Western and Jordanian-led projects, but a great part of the Citadel remains unexcavated.\n\nHistory\nExcavations undertaken since the 1920s by Italian, British, French, Spanish, and Jordanian archaeologists have uncovered signs of human occupation from as far back as the  Middle Bronze Age (1650–1550 BCE) in the form of a tomb that held pottery and scarab seals. \nDuring the Iron Age, the Citadel was home to the Ammonite Kingdom. Several artifacts were discovered confirming its historicity. The Amman Citadel Inscription comes from this period, and is considered to be the oldest known inscription in the Ammonite language, written in the Phoenician alphabet.\nFrom the Hellenistic period, there were not many architectural changes, but pottery provides evidence of occupation. The site became Roman around 30 BCE, and eventually came under Muslim rule in 661 CE. The Citadel declined in importance under Ayyubid rule in the 13th century, but a watchtower was added to the site during this period.\n\nList of main structures\nThe Great Temple of Amman (also inaccurately known as the Temple of Hercules)\nThe Byzantine church\nThe Umayyad Palace complex\nThe Ayyubid watchtower\n\nGreat Temple (\"Temple of Hercules\")\nThe Great Temple, better but inaccurately known as the Temple of Hercules, is thought to be the most significant Roman structure within the Amman Citadel. According to an inscription, the temple was built when Geminius Marcianus was governor of the Province of Arabia (AD 161–166), in the same period as the Roman Theatre (still standing below Citadel Hill).\n\nDescription\nThe temple stood on a podium 43 by 27 m (141 by 88 ft). The temple measured about 30 by 24 m (98 by 79 ft), with an additional outer sanctum of 121 by 72 m (397 by 236 ft). The portico at the front of the temple had six columns c. 13.5 m (45 ft) tall, but there were no columns standing along the sides of the temple, as was the case with some other Roman temples. Some archaeologists interpret the lack of remains of any additional columns as an indication that the temple was probably not finished, and believe the leftover marble was used to build the Byzantine church nearby. The remains of the building and of the statue found near it offer reason to believe that the Amman temple was comparable in size with many of those in ancient Rome.\n\nDeity\nOne of the main excavators of the most recent and very thorough archaeological and reconstruction campaign from the 1990s, Greek archaeologist and classical architect C. Kanellopoulos, writes in one of the resulting official publications that the name Great Temple of Amman should be preferred, as the deity venerated there cannot be securely identified.\nThree years before the publication of Kanellopoulos's book, fellow ACOR chief excavator K. W. Russell wrote in an ACOR newsletter about the discovery of a new fragment of the temple's architrave inscription, which together with fragments discovered in the past made possible a reasonably secure reconstruction of the entire inscription. The reconstruction, produced by Russell and Kanellopoulos, speaks of \"this Herculean sanctuary and festival-place\". Russell corroborates this information with an inscription found in 1905 in another area of Amman, which speaks of a certain city magistrate as \"the constructor of the Heracleion\", or temple of Hercules. This allowed the researchers to identify the Citadel Hill temple with reasonable confidence as being dedicated to Hercules.\nKanellopoulos, however, maintains some doubts, not least due to the fact that the colossal statue whose meager remains have been discovered near the temple, appears to depict a female deity (see below at  Colossal statue). Philadelphia had, in Kanellopoulos's words, two \"dominant gods\", Herakles and Astarte - one male and one female. The excavation report published by Russell together with fellow archaeologists Anthi Koutsoukou, Mohammad Najjar, and Ahmed Momani in 1997, i.e. six years after the discovery of the additional inscribed architrave fragment, is still cautiously titled The Great Temple of Amman: The Excavations.\nDuring the 1990s digs, possibly cultic features along with six votive figurines were discovered underneath the Roman temple area, which might indicate that the site had been used for religious purposes during the Iron Age. It has also been noted that Herakles/Hercules was the  interpretatio graeca of the Semitic god Melqart of the Tyreans, the better known Herakles-Melqart cult allowing to extrapolate on a similar synchretism between Herakles and Milkom, the supreme god of the Ammonites, still worshipped in Roman times in Ammonitis. A Milkom inscription dating to the Iron Age was found on Citadel Hill, allowing for justified speculations on a succession of local cults, progressing from Milkom to Herakles.\n\nColossal statue\nThe site also contains marble fragments of a colossal, partly stone-made statue, estimated to have been around 13 m (42 ft) tall. All that remains are three fingers and an elbow. The statue was probably destroyed in an earthquake.\nWho was the statue depicting? Some identify it as representing Hercules, but C. Kanellopoulos writes that while the hand fragment (three fingers) and the elbow fragment look in every respect as being part of the same statue, the muscular structure around the elbow excludes the statue from depicting Herakles (the Greek iteration of Hercules), and the slender fingers and the fingernails look feminine. He reconstructs the statue as depicting a woman, most likely a female goddess, with the right hand raised and the left one relaxed, in a pose known from certain depictions of Athena. He notes that there were three female deity worshipped in Philadelphia: Athena, Astarte and Demetra, adding a fourth option, Tyche, who is depicted on local coinage in the style of Athena Hephaisteia (an  Athenian iteration of the goddess associated with the Temple of Hephaestus, famously depicted by Alcamenes). Kanellopoulos describes Herakles and Astarte as being Philadelphia's \"dominant gods\".\n\nAyyubid watch tower\nThe Ayyubid watch tower is a stone tower dating back to the Ayyubid period (c. 1170-1250), more specifically in the year 1220. It is located on the southern wall of the Amman Citadel in the center of the Jordanian capital, Amman, adjacent to the Great Temple. It also contains traces of other civilizations that have succeeded in the city for thousands of years. \n\nIt was constructed by the Ayyubids for observation, as it overlooks the center of Amman. It consists of a small room of 9.45 m in length and 7.55 m in width. There are openings in three of its walls for shooting arrows. The fourth wall has, built into its width, a staircase leading to the roof. Blocks of cylindrical columns, which used to be a part of the Roman Great Temple (\"Temple of Hercules\"), were used on the southern façade.\nThe remains of the watch tower on Citadel Hill were initially attributed to the Crusaders, but are now preferentially dated to the Ayyubid period, leaving it to further research to find the location of the Crusader castle. The Jordanian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities restored the building in the early 1990s.\n\nByzantine church\nThe Byzantine church, built in the 6th century during the Byzantine era, is a ruined ancient church next to the Umayyad Palace. The church was built with a basilica-like layout with a central nave with two-sided aisles, typical early Christian architectural design. A section for formal ceremonies is located at the eastern end. Corinthian capitals are used along with acanthus leaves repurposed from the nearby Temple of Hercules. Flagstones were used to pave the church aisles. At the end of the aisles, rectangular rooms exists which were probably added during the Umayyad period. The church most likely was improved and modified over time. Byzantine craftsmanship can be observed in the preserved mosaic floor in the central nave. The church also represents a confluence of Byzantine and early Islamic periods.\nThe site was originally discovered and partially excavated by C.R. Conder, a British explorer, in 1881. Later, in the 1990s, further excavations and restorations took place. Recovered artifacts were put on display in Darat al Funun's library. Some of the inscriptions found name the Roman god Herakles, the Christian martyr Saint George, and Islamic figure Al Khadr.\n\nUmayyad palace complex\nA palace structure (al-Qasr القصر in Arabic) was built by the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724-743). It is positioned at the northern section of the upper level of the Citadel. It is believed that the palace served as an administrative building or the residence of an Umayyad official. The complex contains an audience hall, four assembly rooms, and a colonnaded road. The palace architecture blends Byzantine, Sassanian, and distinct Islamic styles.\nFollowing the Abbasid revolution, the Umayyad palace went through a phase of progressive decay throughout the Abbasid (750-969) and Fatimid (969-1071) periods.\n\nMosque\nThe Umayyad mosque is south of the Umayyad palace. It is an example of early mosques that imitated the Persian-style apadana hall, characterized by a \"forest of columns\"; these mosques are normally found only in Persia and Mesopotamia (Iraq).\n\nCistern\nAdjacent to the palace is a large water cistern which supplied water to the baths, latrines, and other areas of the complex.\n\nJordan Archaeological Museum\nThe Amman Citadel is also the site of the Jordan Archaeological Museum, the former national archaeological museum established in 1951, which is home to an exquisite collection of artifacts from all the significant periods and regions of the country known at the time and discovered in the following decades dating from prehistoric times up to the 15th century, including the Citadel. Its prominent role has been somewhat diminished since the inauguration of the new national museum in 2014, the Jordan Museum, to which some of the artifacts previously displayed at the Citadel Hill venue have been moved.\nThe collections are arranged in chronological order and include items of everyday life such as flint, glass, metal and pottery objects, as well as more artistic items such as jewelry and statues. Highlights of the museum collections include some of the ʿAin Ghazal statues, which are among oldest statues ever made, and plastered human skulls from Jericho. The museum also includes a coin collection.\n\nHistory\nThe museum was established in 1951 on top of Amman's Citadel Hill, among the remains of the Citadel in the heart of the city.\nThe museum formerly housed some of the Dead Sea Scrolls, including the only Copper scroll, which are now on display in the more recently established Jordan Museum, along with some of the Ain Ghazal statues.\n\nLocation\nThe museum is located in the Amman Citadel in Amman, one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world. Two historic sites are nearby on top of the hill, the Roman Temple of Hercules that dates back to the 2nd century, and an Umayyad palace that dates back to the 8th century. Prior to 1967, the museum had a branch in East Jerusalem.\n\nTime periods represented\nThe collections of the museum belong to the following periods:\n\nPaleolithic period: 1,000,000–10,000 years ago\nNeolithic period: 12,000 years ago up to the Bronze Age and Iron Age\nPre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN): 8,300–5,500 BC, the most famous artifacts that belong to this period being the Ain Ghazal statues.\nPottery Neolithic (PN): 5,500–4,300 BC\nChalcolithic:  4,300–3,300 BC\nBronze Age\nEarly Bronze Age: 3,300–1,900 BC\nMiddle Bronze Age: 1,900–1,550 BC\nLate Bronze Age: 1,550–1,200 BC\nIron Age: 1,200–550 BC\nPersian period: c. 550–332 BC\nHellenistic period: c. 332–63 BC\nNabatean period\nRoman period\nByzantine period\nRashidun period\nUmayyad period\nAbbasid period\nCrusader/Ayyubid period\n\nTourism\nStarting in 1995–96, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Jordan in partnership with American (USAID) and Spanish institutions (AECID and CSIC) began several projects to conserve and restore this site to benefit tourists and the local community.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nCited bibliography\nKanellopoulos, Chrysanthos (1994).

Dana Biosphere Reserve was founded in 1989 in the area in and around the Dana village and Wadi Dana comprising 308 square kilometres (119 sq mi).\n\nHuman presence\nThe people of the Ata'ta (or Al Atata In Arabic (العطاعطة أو العطاطة)) tribe are the native inhabitants of Dana Biosphere Reserve. Their history in Dana dates 400 years, with human settlement in the area dating back more than 6000 years. Besides the presence of the Ata'ta people, archeological discoveries suggest Palaeolithic, Egyptian, Nabataean, and Roman settlement in Dana.\n\nAccommodations\nVisitors to Dana Nature Reserve and Dana village can stay at Dana Cooperative Hotel and other accommodations.\n\nGeography\nDana Biosphere Reserve drops from an altitude of 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) on the Qadisiyah plateau to the low-lying desert area of Wadi Araba. The varied geology of Dana contains limestone, sandstone, and granite. The area of Wadi Dana features wind-cut sandstone cliffs. Dana is the only nature reserve in Jordan that crosses four bio-geographical zones; Mediterranean, Irano-Turanian, Saharo-Arabian, and Sudanian penetration.\n\nGeology\nDana's unique landscape is formed by an outcrop (exposed bedrock) of fluvial sandstone, dating back to the Paleozoic and Lower Cretaceous. It is also covered by shallow marine carbonate rocks from the Upper Cretaceous and the Tertiary period. The area around Dana is further characterized by a horst, the Dana Horst, formed by two faults running from east to west, which are the Salawan Fault and the Dana Fault. The horst contains Precambrian granitoids and volcanic rocks in contact with Cretaceous rocks. The origin of this basaltic formation is believed to be from two distinct volcanic eruptions: the first dating back to somewhere between the Miocene and Pleistocene, while the second is a highly recent eruption of the nearby Jabal al-Qadisiyah.\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe diverse environment of Dana is home to 703 plant species, 215 species of birds, and 38 species of mammals.\n\nPlants\nDana is the most diverse area of plant life in the country, consisting of numerous vegetation types including: Phoenician juniper, evergreen oak, sand dunes, acacia, and rocky sudanian. Dana is the southernmost area in the world to host the Mediterranean cypress, Cupressus sempervirens. Of the hundreds of plants species inhabiting Dana, three can be found nowhere else in the world. Many plants, especially trees and shrubs, grow in the highlands of the nature reserve.\n\nEndangered species\nThe threatened Nubian ibex, Syrian serin, caracal, and lesser kestrel are natives of Wadi Dana and plans to save the species were put forth by Global Environment Fund in 1994. Additionally, the largest breeding colony of the Syrian serin is in Dana Nature Reserve. Threats to the animals include hunting.\n\nWater and tourism\nOn 26 May, 2025, Prime Minister Jaafar Hassan underscored Tafilah’s rich yet underdeveloped tourism potential, highlighting landmarks such as the Dana Biosphere Reserve and the ancient village of Sela. He emphasized that unlocking this potential requires inclusive, community-driven development planning to ensure local engagement and sustainability. As part of a broader national strategy, a JD25 million investment will be directed toward improving Tafilah’s water infrastructure between 2025 and 2027, while additional large-scale projects in sectors like energy, transport, and housing aim to stimulate economic growth and create jobs.\n\nSee also\nMujib Nature Reserve\nAzraq Wetland Reserve\nList of nature reserves in Jordan\n Jordan portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nDana from the American center of oriental research.\nDana Biosphere Reserve\nDana Community Cooperative\nThe Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature\nDana Cooperative Hotel",

          "content": "The Wadi Mujib (Arabic: وادي الموجب, romanized: Wādī al-Mūjib), is a river in Jordan. The river empties into the Dead Sea circa 420 metres (1,380 ft) below sea level.\nIn ancient times, the river served as the northern boundary of the kingdom of Moab.\nToday, the Wadi Mujib is fed by seven tributaries. The western part of the river is the site of the Mujib Biosphere Reserve, popular for hikes and canyoning amid dramatic rock formations.\n\nGeography\nDuring the last ice age the water level of the Dead Sea reached 180 metres (590 ft) below sea level, about 240 metres (790 ft) higher than it is today. It flooded the lower areas of the canyons along its banks, which became bays and begun to accumulate sediments. As the climatic conditions changed, about 20,000 years ago, the water level of the lake dropped, leaving the re-emergent canyons blocked with lake marl. Most canyons managed to cut through their plugged outlets and to resume their lower courses; but Wadi Mujib abandoned its former outlet by breaking through a cleft in the sandstone. This narrow cleft became the bottleneck of an enormous drainage basin of 6,571 km2 (2,537 sq mi) with a huge discharge and annual sediment yield of 143,780 tonnes. During the years the cleft was scoured deeper and the gorge of Wadi Mujib was formed.\nThe Mujib Dam was completed in 2004 at the bottom of the wadi, where the modern road crosses the river. As a result, a large lake has formed.\n\nMujib Reserve\nThe Mujib Reserve of Wadi Mujib is located in the mountainous landscape to the east of the Dead Sea, in the southern part of Jordan valley, approximately 90 kilometres (56 mi) south of Amman. A 212 km2 (82 sq mi) reserve was created in 1987 by the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature and is regionally and internationally important, particularly for the bird life that the reserve supports. In 2011, UNESCO declared Mujib biosphere reserve. It extends to the Kerak and Madaba mountains to the north and south, reaching 1,277 metres (4,190 ft) above sea level in some places. This 1,708-metre (5,604 ft) variation in elevation of its drainage basin, combined with the valley's year round water flow from seven tributaries, means that Wadi Mujib enjoys magnificent biodiversity that is still being explored and documented. The reserve consists of mountainous, rocky, and sparsely vegetated desert (up to 800 metres (2,600 ft)), with cliffs and gorges cutting through plateaus. Perennial, spring-fed streams flow to the shores of the Dead Sea.\nOver 300 species of plants, 10 species of carnivores and numerous species of permanent and migratory birds have been recorded. Some of the remote mountain and valley areas are difficult to reach, and thus offer safe haven for rare species of cats, goats and other mountain animals.\nThe slopes of the mountainous land are very sparsely vegetated, with a steppe-type vegetation on plateaus. Groundwater seepage does occur in places along the Dead Sea shore, for example at the hot springs of Zara, which support a luxuriant thicket of Acacia, Tamarix, Phoenix and Nerium, and a small marsh. The less severe slopes of the reserve are used by pastoralists for the grazing of sheep and goats.\nThe hot springs of Hammamat Ma'in lie close to the borders of the reserve and popular for tourism and recreation.\nThe Jordanian military have a temporary camp in the south of the reserve.\n\nBiology and ecology\nFauna\nThe reserve is strategically important as a safe stop-over for the huge number of migratory birds which fly annually along the Great Rift Valley between Africa and northeast Europe.\nIt is possible to see the following birds in Wadi Mujib:\n\nLammergeier (Gypaetus barbatus)\nEgyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus)\nEurasian griffon (Gyps fulvus)\nLevant sparrowhawk (Accipiter brevipes)\nLesser kestrel (Falco naumanni)\nSooty falcon (Falco concolor)\nSand partridge (Ammoperdix heyi)\nHume's owl (Strix butleri)\nHooded wheatear (Oenanthe monacha)\nBlackstart (Cercomela melanura)\nArabian babbler (Turdoides squamiceps)\nStriolated bunting (Emberiza striolata)\nTrumpeter finch (Bucanetes githagineus)\nDead Sea sparrow (Passer moabiticus)\nTristram's starling (Onychognathus tristramii)\nMany carnivores also inhabit the various vegetation zones in Mujib, such as the striped hyena and the Syrian wolf.\nAnother common animal in Mujib is the Nubian ibex, a large mountain goat which became threatened as a result of over-hunting.\n\nHistory\nIron Age and biblical narrative\nWadi Mujib, or the Arnon Stream as it was known in biblical times, has always been an important boundary-line. Bible scholars have noticed a seeming contradiction in the Hebrew Bible regarding the ownership of the area between the Arnon and Jabbok rivers. According to Numbers, that area originally belonged to the Moabites and was later conquered by Sihon, king of the Amorites, before the Israelites took it (Numbers 21:13–26). However, Judges presents this land as initially Ammonite territory, which the Israelites took from Sihon.(Judges 11:18).\nFollowing the Israelite settlement the stream divided, theoretically at least, Moab from the tribes of Reuben and Gad (Deuteronomy 3:12–16). But Moab, in fact, lay as much to the north as it did to the south of the Arnon. To the north, for example, were Aroer, Dibon, Medeba, and other Moabite towns. Even under Omri and Ahab, who held part of the Moabite territory, Israel did not hold sway farther south than Ataroth, about ten miles north of the Arnon.\nMesha, King of Moab, in his inscription (Mesha Stele, line 10) says that the Gadites (not the Reubenites) formerly occupied Ataroth, whence he in turn expelled the people of Israel. He mentions (line 26) his having constructed a road along the Arnon. The ancient importance of the river and of the towns in its vicinity is attested by the numerous ruins of bridges, forts, and buildings found upon or near it. Its fords are alluded to by the Book of Isaiah (16:2). Its \"heights,\" crowned with the castles of chiefs, were also celebrated in verse (Numbers 21:28).\n\nHellenistic and Roman periods\nWadi Mujib has been identified as a possible location of the Forest of Jardes, mentioned by the first-century historian Josephus in connection with the later stages of the First Jewish Revolt. In 71 CE, one year after the fall of Jerusalem and shortly after the surrender of the fortress at Machaerus, Roman legate Sextus Lucilius Bassus pursued and killed Jewish rebels in the area.\nIn Roman times, a fort garrisoned by Cohors III Alpinorum, known as Apud Arnona, was situated close to the point where the Via Nova route crossed the Arnon river. One of the river's confluents, Seil Heidan, was known in Roman times as Aidonas.\n\nPanorama\nSee also\nDana Biosphere Reserve\nAzraq Wetland Reserve\nNature Reserves in Jordan\nWadi Zarqa\n Jordan portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThe Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature, Jordan\nFlora and Fauna of Wadi Mujib\nConstraints for Sustainable Eco Tourism in Mujib\nPhotos of Wadi Mujib at the American Center of Research",

          "content": "'Iraq al-Amir or Araq el-Amir (Arabic:عراق الأمير - literally, \"Caves of the Prince\") is the name shared by a town and nearby caves, within the municipality of Amman in the Jordan Valley. Located about 15 km southwest of the town of Wadi as-Seer, it has a population of about 6000 people, mostly members of the Abbadi tribe. It is located on hills with high and medium altitude, in an area with many springs and famous for its olive trees and other forest trees.\nThere are many caves in the hills which were inhabited during the Copper Age. There are also remarkable Roman-Byzantine architectural remains. It is a large cave church – closed because of on-going excavations –, and a second church built outside right in front of it. The entrance of the cave can be identified by a façade decorated with a pediment with crosses. The site is called Mugharat al-Kaniseh (Cave of the Church) by the local community. \n\n About 500 metres south of the town stands an archaeological site known as Al-Iraq, dominated by a partially restored Hellenistic period palace known as Qasr al-Abd, which is dated to the late 2nd century BCE. Most scholars agree that Qasr al-Abd was built by the Tobiads, a notable Jewish family of the Second Temple period. This identification is based on a Hebrew inscription found in a nearby burial cave that mentions the name \"Tobiah\".\nIraq Al-Amir is a stop on the Jordan Trail. It is a side trip of Region 3, Salt to Wadi Zarqa (84.4 km). It is 22.3 km from Salt or 15.2 km from Fuheis. From Iraq Al-Amir, the trail makes its way to Husban (19.5 km away).\n\nHistory of settlement\nThe area was first settled in the Middle Stone Age (c. 20,000–10,000 PB). The caves dwellings continued to be used throughout the Bronze Age, as well as the first and second parts of the Iron Age.\nHuman presence continued in the site throughout the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, and reached its peak during the Hellenistic period, after Alexander the Great conquered the region in 332 BCE. The Seleucid king Ptolemy II Philadelphus built a town in that location, transferring population from Tyre, Phoenicia, so that during Hellenistic rule, Iraq al-Amir was known under the Greek name Tyros. The Tobiad palace of Qasr al-Abd was built in the same era.\nThe city particularly prospered in the Byzantine period. It was built around the 3rd century BCE, and reused under Byzantine rule before being destroyed by an earthquake. Pieces of Islamic pottery were also discovered at the site, specifically from the Umayyad and Mamluk times.\n\nQasr al-Abd\nOne of the striking sights at Iraq al-Amir is the Qasr al-Abd palace  (Arabic: قصر العبد, lit. 'Castle of the Slave'), considered as one of the most important Hellenistic remains in Jordan. The first known written description of the palace and its creation comes down to us from Flavius Josephus, a Jewish-Roman historian from the first century CE. The castle was used during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. The rectangular building was constructed from white limestone from the surrounding area and measures 18x37.5 metres, rising to about 14 metres. The walls are between 90 centimetres to 3.90 metres thick. Josephus maintained that it was surrounded by a moat and a protective wall.\nThe ground floor of the castle has a north and a south gate, as well as a north and south corridor. On the west side of both gates, there are four rooms. On the east side\nthere are steps leading to the second floor. On the north side there are water tanks and two lobbies. On the east side are seven windows for lighting and ventilation.\nThe upper floor has bedrooms and reception rooms. This part of the castle was unfinished, and was partly destroyed by an earthquake in the fourth century CE.\nIn the summer of 2018, Qasr al-Abd was renovated by the Jordanian Ministry of Tourism and Antiques. Several paved pathways were created around the structure and a building now houses a small theatre that plays an animation, narrated in Arabic and subtitled in French. The animation illustrates what is thought to be the original vision for the dwelling, a summer lodge, surrounded by water, to give the illusion of a boat floating in a sea.\n\nWomen's Cooperative\nIraq Al-Amir is home to the Iraq Al-Amir Women's Cooperative. The Iraq Al-Amir Knowledge Station is located a short distance opposite the parking for the cave parking. It is next to the mosque. The cooperative involves women and girls from nearby Wadi Al Seer villages and produces hand-made paper, ceramics and clay pottery, as well as hand-woven fabrics. The fabric is crafted in a traditional manner, using a hand-weaving mill and three looms.\n\nSee also\nJordan Trail\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nWill, E. and Larché, F., 'Iraq al Amir, le Château du Tobiade Hyrcan. 2 vols (Paris: P.

          "content": "Umm ar-Rasas (Arabic: أم الرّصاص; ancient name: Kastron Mefa'a) is located 30 km southeast of Madaba in the Amman Governorate in central Jordan. It was once accessible by branches of the King's Highway, and is situated in the semi-arid steppe region of the Jordanian Desert. The site has been associated with the biblical settlement of Mephaat mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah. The Roman military utilized the site as a strategic garrison, but it was later converted and inhabited by Christian and Islamic communities. In 2004, the site was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is valued by archaeologists for its extensive ruins dating to the Roman, Byzantine, and early Muslim periods. The Franciscan academic society in Jerusalem, Studium Biblicum Franciscanum (SBF), carried out excavations at the north end of the site in 1986, but much of the area remains buried under debris.\n\nEarly history\nParticularly during the epochs of the Early Bronze Age III-IV, Iron Age II, and Roman-Byzantine eras, dense populations inhabited the topographical regions beyond the western banks of the Dead Sea. Among these ancient settlements, the site of Mephaat has been mentioned in biblical texts as one of the cities upon the plateau to be condemned to great destruction (Jeremiah 48:21). Many branches of the King's Highway provided a means for reaching the more remote ancient cities, but the main route served as the forerunner for the Via Traiana Nova built by the Roman Emperor Trajan (98–117 AD). This road with its many branches facilitated travel, and Roman military encampments were set in place along the way as a defensive measure against barbarian assaults across the Roman desert frontier known as the Limes Arabicus. Eusebius of Caesarea identified Mephaat as the camp site of a Roman army near the desert in his Onomasticon (K.128:21). Also, the excavation of a Byzantine church here exposed an inscription naming the area as \"Castron Mephaa\" further supporting the theory that Umm-ar Rasas and the biblical Mephaat are one and the same.\n\nMosaics\nThe most important discovery on the site was the mosaic floor of the Church of St Stephen. It was made in 785 (discovered after 1986). The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan. On the central panel, hunting and fishing scenes are depicted, while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region including Philadelphia (Amman), Madaba, Esbounta (Heshbon), Belemounta (Ma'an), Areopolis (Ar-Rabba), Charac Moaba (Karak), Jerusalem, Nablus, Caesarea, and Gaza. The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative. Six mosaic masters signed the work: Staurachios from Esbus, Euremios, Elias, Constantinus, Germanus, and Abdela. To the north of the St. Stephen's church lies another, damaged, mosaic floor in the earlier (587) Church of Bishop Sergius. Another four churches were excavated nearby, some with traces of mosaic decoration.\n\nByzantine period\nBy the 4th century C.E., the advent of pilgrimage caused Palestine to become the nucleus of the Christian world, and scores of pious men and women traversed the desert seeking sites of scriptural significance as well as communion with their creator. The number of pilgrims intensified by the 5th century C.E., and many Christians chose to settle in the desert establishing monastic communities. Umm ar-Rasas was converted into an ecclesiastical center boasting numerous Byzantine churches. Among the notable finds unearthed at Umm-ar Rasas is the Church of Saint Stephen, which features elaborate and sophisticated mosaics. The discovery of Greek inscriptions within the mosaics confirmed dating to 756-785 C.E. The date range coincides with the Abbasid Caliphate period of Muslim rule, and demonstrates Christian occupation later than surrounding areas. The mosaics illustrate municipal vignettes with explanatory text covering a series of cities in Palestine, Jordan, and along the Nile Delta. Absent from the mosaics at Umm ar-Rasas are portrayals of principal holy places revered by pilgrims such as Bethlehem, Hebron or Nazareth unlike the Madaba Map found nearby.\n\nStylite tower\nThe salient feature of Umm ar-Rasas stands about 1 mile (1.6 km) north of the walled ruins. Interpreted to be a stylite tower, the soaring structure served as a platform for Christian ascetics living in isolation at the top as well as an altar for a call to prayer. Ornamented with carved Christian symbols on all four sides, the square pillar endures in the distance as evidence of the once flourishing community established in the Byzantine era as a center for spiritual enlightenment.\n\nMuslim conquest\nMuslim armies penetrated Palestine during the summer of 634 C.E., and initially assaulted regions along the Mediterranean coast including the Gaza Strip. Discontented with Byzantine control, local Arab-speaking tribesmen living in the desert expanses willingly aided the Muslim invaders easing their conquest. The efficacious campaign was characterized by limited destruction, and many cities of the Holy Land surrendered on terms to Muslim rule. Byzantine churches were infrequently transformed into mosques, but especially during the Abbasid period, the Muslim government actively enforced restrictive laws against Christian images. Mosaics were defaced by the removal and reassembly of colored tesserae as seen at the Church of Saint Stephen. Following the Muslim victory, Christians continued to make pilgrimages to holy places, however, the numbers declined with the threat of imprisonment by Muslim officials. Many of the monasteries and churches built by Byzantine Christians were ultimately abandoned.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nEarly Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East\nMichele Piccirillo, SBF archaeologist who led the digs and published the results\nPetra\nWadi Rum\nQasr Amra\nList of World Heritage Sites in Jordan\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n Media related to Umm ar-Rasas at Wikimedia Commons\nVery informative site in English\nUmm ar-Rasas panoramic video\nPhotos of Umm er-Rasas at the American Center of Research\nPhotos of Umm al-Rasas at the Manar al-Athar photo archive",

          "content": "The Azraq Wetland Reserve is a nature reserve located in the town of Azraq in the eastern desert of Jordan. An oasis for migratory birds, the reserve was established in 1978 and covers 12 square kilometres (4.6 sq mi). The natural springs dried up in 1992 and most migratory birds subsequently moved away from the area. Artificial springs are maintained today in order to keep the site a tourist destination.\n\nHistory\nThe wetlands were created around 250,000 BC as a result of being fed by aquifers. Azraq has, since ancient times, been the crossroads of both human trade routes and bird migrations. Millions of cubic meters of freshwater attracted camels caravans carrying spices and herbs traveling between Arabia, Mesopotamia, and Syria. Millions of migrating birds stopped in Azraq between Africa and Europe. However, in the 1960s, water from the acquifers began to be pumped to support Amman's booming population. In 1978, the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) established Azraq as a wetlands reserve.  By 1992, however, the springs had dried up, and the aquifers that had once gushed ceased to provide. All the water buffalos of Azraq died, and many migrating birds went to the Sea of Galilee instead.\n\nAzraq today\nThe Azraq wetlands have been described as in a state of \"ecological collapse\". RSCN continues to fight an uphill battle against rising population and a growing demand for water. The 10,000,000 cubic metres (353,146,667 cu ft) of water per year provided by the Jordanian Ministry of Water to maintain Azraq is only sufficient to restore Azraq to 10% of its original size. As of 2018, there are more than 500 illegal wells still pumping water from Azraq. In just 37 years, the number of migrant birds has reduced from 347,000 as of February 2, 1967, to 1200 birds as of February 2, 2000. Azraq provides drinking water for one-quarter of Amman. 25 square kilometres (9.7 sq mi) once covered by wetlands have now dried up.\n\nAccommodation\nRSCN maintains an Azraq Lodge several kilometers away from the wetlands which features a gift shop, restaurant, 16 rooms in a 1940s British military hospital, and a reception area.\n\nTrails and activities\nThe Marsh Trail is a raised platform going through the reserve that is approximately 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi). Sections of the trail are on land going through the reeds. Halfway through the trail is the mud-brick \"rustic bird hide\", overlooking one of the reserve's lagoons, which is used for birdwatching.\n\nWildlife\nBirds migrating between Africa and Eurasia stop in Azraq during the long journey each year, passing through Anatolia along the way. The partial restoration of the wetlands by RSCN have resulted in the return of several migratory species, such as the hoopoe lark, Cetti's warbler, the desert finch, and the marsh harrier. Among the 280 recorded migratory species in Azraq are the ruff, avocet, little stint, and the little ringed plover. Additionally, several birds of prey stop in Azraq, such as the European honey buzzard and Montagu's harrier.\n\nPrehistoric wildlife\nFrom ancient times, Azraq was an ecological extension of Africa. In this time period, many animals often characterized as African lived in Azraq. Among these species were the Syrian wild ass, wild camel, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, Asian elephant, gazelle, aurochs, Asiatic cheetah, Syrian ostrich, Asiatic lion, and Arabian oryx. All of these animals, except the gazelle, are now extinct in Azraq, and Jordan alike.\n\nReligious Significance\nThe German mystic, Bl. Anne Catherine Emmerich, identifies the Azraq wetland as the place at which Jesus Christ visited the last two surviving of the Three Kings, who had journeyed to meet him, at his birth, and who had afterward resided there.\n\nSee also\nDana Biosphere Reserve\nWadi Mujib\nWadi Rum\nDibeen Forest Reserve\nShaumari Wildlife Reserve\nRoyal Society for the Conservation of Nature\nList of nature reserves in Jordan\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nRoyal Society for the Conservation of Nature\nWheel shapes near Azraq Oasis, visible only from the air\nGallery of aerial photos, Azraq Wheels",

          "content": "Fuheis (Arabic: الفحيص) is a Christian majority town in the central Jordanian governorate of Balqa. It lies in between Salt and Amman, at a distance of 6 and 13 kilometers respectively. .\n\nThe population of Fuheis was estimated to be 21,908 in 2021, 87% are Jordanian citizens, 95% are Christians, and with a male-to-female ratio of 52:48.\nAccording to a national census in 2015, the population was 18,916, there were 4,658 households in the town with an average of 4.06 persons per household, lower than the national average of 4.82 persons per household. The population of Fuheis increases in the summer, as many of the town's residents who have emigrated to the United States and Europe return for their summer vacations. The town's elevation renders it cool enough to spend the summer comfortably.\nFuheis is also famous for its traditional habits from singing and dancing (dabke), and for depending on its farms.\n\nHistory\nIn 1838 Fuheis was noted located east of Al-Salt.\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 2,946 inhabitants in Fuheis,  of whom 2,391 were Christians.\n\nGeography and climate\nThe town has an elevation ranging from 740 to 1,050 meters (2,430 to 3,440 ft) above mean sea level, and experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa). It receives approximately 500 mm (20 in) of precipitation annually, with occasional snowfall accumulating on its peaks.\n\nEconomy and development\nFuheis' economy has historically centered around agriculture. Most of Fuheis' population works in agriculture, trade, cement industry, service industry, and civil or office jobs. The olive industry is important to Fuheis' economy, along with orchards and vineyards. The cement factory - Jordan's largest - is by far the largest industry in Fuheis, employing about 70% of the town's population. Among its most important villages are al-Rahwa, Ras al-Jundi, and al-Suqariah, known for their farms and trees.\nIn 2010, German researchers from the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research implemented a demonstration facility for decentralised wastewater technology in Fuheis. The project was handed over to the management of Al-Balqa` Applied University.\n\nReligion\nApproximately 60% of the town's population belong to Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, 35% are members of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. Sunni Muslims and Armenian Orthodox Christians make up the rest 5% of the population. \nThe Latin Parish of Fuheis established a secondary school during the Ottoman Period in 1885. Students of this school learned Arabic, Religion and Math. The school has since expanded, remaining open until today.\n\nHeritage and archaeology\nArchaeological excavations in Fuheis uncovered a circular building from white limestone which dates back to the Iron Age and the Byzantine age. This building was repurposed as a church in the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, and within the building is a blueprint of the church in addition to a number of graves that were built in the church's land. The excavations suggest that the area's water sources may have drawn many to the region or that the settlement had a military purpose. The ruins are surrounded by small dug wells and enclosed water closets which were connected by a spout carved from rock. \nIn the same area, excavators found a carving on basalt rock in Greek letters and crosses carved into limestone.\n\nCulture\nAl-Rowaq\nFuheis' Rowaq Al-Balqa' district boasts hundred-year-old stone cottages in the old town, preserved by a local who bought an art gallery in the area and proceeded to buy several cottages near it, converting them to art-and-craft shops.\n\nTourism and Outdoor Activities\nFuhais is increasingly recognized not only for its historical and cultural significance but also for its emerging outdoor activities, particularly rock climbing.\n\nRock Climbing\nFuhais has become a notable climbing destination in Jordan, attracting local and international climbers. The area features limestone cliffs with multiple bolted sport routes of varying difficulty, making it a popular alternative to the traditional climbing of Wadi Rum.\nThe development of climbing routes in Fuhais was pioneered by Hakim Tamimi, a Jordanian climber who has been instrumental in bolting sport climbing areas across the country. His contributions to Fuhais and other climbing areas such as Dur Morsud and Iraq Al Dub have been documented in international climbing reports and academic studies.\nSeveral international climbing events and trips have been hosted in Fuhais, contributing to Jordan's growing reputation as a Middle Eastern climbing hub. Climbers visiting Fuhais often combine their trip with other adventure activities in nearby regions, further supporting adventure tourism in Jordan.\nMore information on climbing routes and conditions can be found on adventure platforms and climbing community websites.\n\nFuheis festival\nFuheis Festival is an annually held event in Fuheis, and it is considered to be the second biggest festival in Jordan, after Jerash Festival.\nThey have celebrated their silver jubilee in 2016, where they have welcomed bands and artists from Jordan, Syria, Palestine and Lebanon to perform in concerts and poetry evenings.\nSeveral artists and singers from across the region were invited to perform in the town, like: Wadih El Safi, Melhem Barakat, Sabah Fakhri, Fares Karam, Moeen Charif, Omar Al-Abdallat, George Kurdahi, Najwa Karam, and many more, and the variety of night events and activities attracts around 10,000 to 30,000 visitors yearly.\n\nList of mayors of Fuhais\nSee also\nGreek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem\nLatin Patriarchate of Jerusalem\nJordanian Christians\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\nFuheis.net Archived 2010-12-30 at the Wayback Machine\nPhotos of Fuheis from the American Center of Research\n[1]",

          "title": "Salt",
          "content": "Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl). When used in food, especially in granulated form, it is more formally called table salt. In the form of a natural crystalline mineral, salt is also known as rock salt or halite. Salt is essential for life in general (being the source of the essential dietary minerals sodium and chlorine), and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings, and is known to uniformly improve the taste perception of food. Salting, brining, and pickling are ancient and important methods of food preservation.\nSome of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6000 BC, when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt works in China dates to approximately the same period. Salt was prized by the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Hittites, Egyptians, and Indians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues, for instance triggering the El Paso Salt War which took place in El Paso in the late 1860s. Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance.\nSalt is processed from salt mines, and by the evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. The greatest single use for salt (sodium chloride) is as a feedstock for the production of chemicals. It is used to produce caustic soda and chlorine, and in the manufacture of products such as polyvinyl chloride, plastics, and paper pulp. Of the annual global production of around three hundred million tonnes, only a small percentage is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt. Table salt usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.\nSodium is an essential element for human health via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic solute. However, excessive salt consumption increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. Such health effects of salt have long been studied. Numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods. The World Health Organization recommends that adults consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium, equivalent to 5 grams of salt, per day.\n\nHistory\nAll through history, the availability of salt has been pivotal to civilization. What is now thought to have been the first city in Europe is Solnitsata, in Bulgaria, which was a salt mine, providing the area now known as the Balkans with salt since 5400 BC. Salt was the best-known food preservative, especially for meat, for many thousands of years. A very ancient salt-works operation has been discovered at the Poiana Slatinei archaeological site next to a salt spring in Lunca, Neamț County, Romania. Evidence indicates that Neolithic people of the Precucuteni Culture were boiling the salt-laden spring water through the process of briquetage to extract salt as far back as 6050 BC. The salt extracted from this operation may have directly correlated with the rapid growth of this society's population soon after production began. The harvest of salt from the surface of Xiechi Lake near Yuncheng in Shanxi, China, dates back to at least 6000 BC, making it one of the oldest verifiable saltworks.\nThere is more salt in animal tissues, such as meat, blood, and milk, than in plant tissues. Nomads who subsist on their flocks and herds do not eat salt with their food, but agriculturalists, feeding mainly on cereals and vegetable matter, need to supplement their diet with salt. With the spread of civilization, salt became one of the world's main trading commodities. It was of high value to the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites and other peoples of antiquity. In the Middle East, salt was used to seal an agreement ceremonially, and the ancient Hebrews made a \"covenant of salt\" with God and sprinkled salt on their offerings to show their trust in him. \nAn ancient practice in time of war was salting the earth: scattering salt around in a defeated city to symbolically prevent plant growth. The Bible tells the story of King Abimelech who was ordered by God to do this at Shechem. Texts claim that the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus Africanus ploughed over and sowed the city of Carthage with salt after it was defeated in the Third Punic War (146 BC), although this story is now considered to be entirely apocryphal.\nSalt may have been used for barter in connection with the obsidian trade in Anatolia in the Neolithic Era. Salt was included among funeral offerings found in ancient Egyptian tombs from the third millennium BC, as were salted birds, and salt fish. From about 2800 BC, the Egyptians began exporting salt fish to the Phoenicians in return for Lebanon cedar, glass, and the dye Tyrian purple. The Phoenicians traded Egyptian salted fish and salt from North Africa throughout their Mediterranean trade empire. Herodotus described salt trading routes across Libya back in the 5th century BC. In the early years of the Roman Empire, roads were built for the transportation of salt from the salt imported at Ostia to the capital.\nIn Africa, salt was used as currency south of the Sahara. Slabs of rock salt were used as coins in Abyssinia. The Tuareg have traditionally maintained routes across the Sahara especially for the transportation of salt by Azalai salt caravans. The caravans still cross the desert from southern Niger to Bilma, although much of the trade now takes place by truck. Each camel takes two bales of fodder and two of trade goods northwards and returns laden with salt pillars and dates. In Gabon, before the arrival of Europeans, the coast people carried on a remunerative trade with those of the interior by the medium of sea salt. This was gradually displaced by the salt that Europeans brought in sacks, so that the coast natives lost their previous profits; as of the late 1950s, sea salt was still the currency best appreciated in the interior.\nSalzburg, Hallstatt, and Hallein lie within 17 km (11 mi) of each other on the river Salzach in central Austria in an area with extensive salt deposits. Salzach means \"salt river\", while Salzburg means \"salt castle\", both taking their names from the German word Salz, salt. Hallstatt was the site of the world's first salt mine. The town gave its name to the Hallstatt culture that began mining for salt in the area in about 800 BC. Around 400 BC, the townsfolk, who had previously used pickaxes and shovels, began open pan salt making. During the first millennium BC, Celtic communities grew rich trading salt and salted meat to Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome in exchange for wine and other luxuries.\nThe word salary comes from the Latin word for salt. The reason for this is unknown; a persistent modern claim that the Roman Legions were sometimes paid in salt is baseless. The word salad literally means \"salted\", and comes from the ancient Roman practice of salting leaf vegetables.\nWars have been fought over salt. Venice won the Salt War (1304) with Padua over supplying the product in certain areas, and the War of Ferrara (1482–1484) for the same reason. It played a role in the American Revolution and the San Elizario Salt War. Cities on overland trade routes grew rich by levying duties, and towns like Liverpool flourished on the export of salt extracted from the salt mines of Cheshire. Governments have at different times imposed salt taxes on their peoples. The voyages of Christopher Columbus are said to have been financed from salt production in southern Spain. The oppressive salt tax in France was one of the causes of the French Revolution. After being repealed, this tax was reimposed by Napoleon when he became emperor to pay for his foreign wars, and was not abolished until 1946. In 1930, Mahatma Gandhi led a crowd of 100,000 protestors on the \"Dandi March\" or \"Salt Satyagraha\", during which they made their own salt from the sea as a demonstration of their opposition to the colonial salt tax. This act of civil disobedience inspired numerous Indians and transformed the Indian independence movement into a national struggle.\n\nPhysical properties\nSalt is mostly sodium chloride (NaCl). Sea salt and mined salt may contain trace elements. Mined salt is often refined. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. When dissolved in water sodium chloride separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12 °C (−6.02 °F) for 23.31 wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7 °C (227.7 °F).\n\nEdible salt\nSalt is essential to the health of humans and other animals, and it is one of the five basic taste sensations. It is known to uniformly improve the taste perception of food, including otherwise unpalatable food. Salt is used in many cuisines, and it is often found in salt shakers on diners' eating tables for their personal use on food. Salt is also an ingredient in many manufactured foodstuffs. Table salt is a refined salt containing about 97 to 99 percent sodium chloride. Usually, anticaking agents such as sodium aluminosilicate or magnesium carbonate are added to make it free-flowing. Iodized salt, containing potassium iodide, is widely available. Some people put a desiccant, such as a few grains of uncooked rice or a saltine cracker, in their salt shakers to absorb extra moisture and help break up salt clumps that may otherwise form.\n\nFortified table salt\nSome table salt sold for consumption contains additives that address a variety of health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of additives vary from country to country. Iodine is an important micronutrient for humans, and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine (hypothyroidism) and enlargement of the thyroid gland (endemic goitre) in adults or cretinism in children. Iodized salt has been used to correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide, sodium iodide, or sodium iodate. A small amount of dextrose may be added to stabilize the iodine. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities. Iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used.\nThe amount of iodine and the specific iodine compound added to salt varies. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends 150 micrograms of iodine per day for both men and women. US iodized salt contains 46–77 ppm (parts per million), whereas in the UK the recommended iodine content of iodized salt is 10–22 ppm.\nSodium ferrocyanide, yellow prussiate of soda, is sometimes added to salt as an anticaking agent. Such anticaking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely. The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive was found to be provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988. Other anticaking agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or magnesium carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two compounds.\nIn \"doubly fortified salt\", both iodide and iron salts are added. The latter alleviates iron deficiency anaemia, which interferes with the mental development of an estimated 40% of infants in the developing world. A typical iron source is ferrous fumarate. Another additive, especially important for pregnant women, is folic acid (vitamin B9), which gives the table salt a yellow colour. Folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects and anaemia, which affect young mothers, especially in developing countries.\nA lack of fluoride in the diet is the cause of a greatly increased incidence of dental caries. Fluoride salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries where water fluoridation is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.\n\nOther kinds\nUnrefined sea salt contains small amounts of magnesium and calcium halides and sulfates, traces of algal products, salt-resistant bacteria and sediment particles. The calcium and magnesium salts confer a faintly bitter overtone, and they make unrefined sea salt hygroscopic, i.e., it gradually absorbs moisture from air if stored uncovered. Algal products contribute a mildly \"fishy\" or \"sea-air\" odour, the latter from organobromine compounds. Sediments, the proportion of which varies with the source, give the salt a dull grey appearance.\nSince taste and aroma compounds are often detectable by humans in minute concentrations, sea salt may have a more complex flavour than pure sodium chloride when sprinkled on top of food. When salt is added during cooking however, these flavours would likely be overwhelmed by those of the food ingredients. The refined salt industry cites scientific studies saying that raw sea and rock salts do not contain enough iodine salts to prevent iodine deficiency diseases.\nSalts have diverse mineralities depending on their source, giving each  a unique flavour. Fleur de sel, a natural sea salt from the surface of evaporating brine in salt pans, has a distinctive flavour varying with its source. In traditional Korean cuisine, so-called \"bamboo salt\" is prepared by roasting salt in a bamboo container plugged with mud at both ends. This product absorbs minerals from the bamboo and the mud, and has been claimed to increase the anticlastogenic and antimutagenic properties of doenjang, a fermented bean paste. Kosher or kitchen salt has a larger grain size than table salt and is used in cooking. It can be useful for brining, in bread or pretzel making, and as a scrubbing agent when combined with oil.\n\nSalt in food\nSalt is present in most foods, but in naturally occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it is present in very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where it functions as both a preservative and a flavouring. Dairy salt is used in the preparation of butter and cheese products. As a flavouring, salt enhances the taste of other foods by suppressing the bitterness of those foods making them more palatable and relatively sweeter.\nBefore the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting was one of the main methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67 mg sodium per 100 g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990 mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63 mg while bacon contains 1,480 mg, and potatoes contain 7 mg but potato crisps 800 mg per 100 g. Salt is used extensively in cooking as a flavouring, and in cooking techniques such as with salt crusts and brining. The main sources of salt in the Western diet, apart from direct use, are bread and cereals, meat, and dairy products.\nIn many East Asian cultures, salt is not traditionally used as a condiment. In its place, condiments such as soy sauce, fish sauce and oyster sauce tend to have a high sodium content and fill a similar role to table salt in western cultures. They are most often used for cooking rather than as table condiments.\n\nBiology of salt taste\nHuman salt taste is detected by sodium taste receptors present in taste bud cells on the tongue. Human sensory taste testing studies have shown that proteolyzed forms of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) function as the human salt taste receptor.\n\nSodium consumption and health\nTable salt is made up of just under 40% sodium by weight, so a 6 g serving (1 teaspoon) contains about 2,400 mg of sodium. Sodium serves a vital purpose in the human body: via its role as an electrolyte, it helps nerves and muscles to function correctly, and it is one factor involved in the osmotic regulation of water content in body organs (fluid balance). Most of the sodium in the Western diet comes from salt. The habitual salt intake in many Western countries is about 10 g per day, and it is higher than that in many countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. The high level of sodium in many processed foods has a major impact on the total amount consumed. In the United States, 75% of the sodium eaten comes from processed and restaurant foods, 11% from cooking and table use and the rest from what is found naturally in foodstuffs.\nBecause consuming too much sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake is associated with a greater risk of stroke, total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000 mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.\nThe World Health Organization recommends that adults should consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium (which is contained in 5 g of salt) per day. Guidelines by the United States recommend that people with hypertension, African Americans, and middle-aged and older adults should limit consumption to no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day and meet the potassium recommendation of 4,700 mg/day with a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables.\nWhile reduction of sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day is recommended by developed countries, one review recommended that sodium intake be reduced to at least 1,200 mg (contained in 3 g of salt) per day, as a further reduction in salt intake led to a greater fall in systolic blood pressure for all age groups and ethnicities. Another review indicated that there is inconsistent/insufficient evidence to conclude that reducing sodium intake to lower than 2,300 mg per day is either beneficial or harmful.\nEvidence shows a more complicated relationship between salt and cardiovascular disease. \"The association between sodium consumption and cardiovascular disease or mortality is U-shaped, with increased risk at both high and low sodium intake.\" The findings showed that increased mortality from excessive salt intake was primarily associated with individuals with hypertension. The levels of increased mortality among those with restricted salt intake appeared to be similar regardless of blood pressure. This evidence shows that while those with hypertension should primarily focus on reducing sodium to recommended levels, all groups should seek to maintain a healthy level of sodium intake of between 4 and 5 grams (equivalent to 10–13 g salt) a day.\nOne of the two most prominent dietary risks for disability in the world are diets high in sodium.\n\nNon-dietary uses\nOnly a small percentage of the salt manufactured in the world is used in food. The remainder is used in agriculture, water treatment, chemical production, de-icing, and other industrial use cases. In the practice of watering plants with salt as a fertilizer, applying a moderate concentration helps avoid potential toxicity; typically, 1–3 grams (0.035–0.106 oz) per liter is considered safe and effective for most plants. Sodium chloride is one of the most widely used inorganic raw materials. It is a feedstock in the production of  caustic soda and chlorine. These are used in the manufacture of PVC, paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic compounds.\nSalt is used as a flux in the production of aluminium. For this purpose, a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants. It is used in the manufacture of soaps and glycerine, where it is used to saponify fats. As an emulsifier, salt is used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber, and another use is in the firing of pottery, when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the ceramic material, forming a strong glaze.\nWhen drilling through loose materials such as sand or gravel, salt may be added to the drilling fluid to provide a stable \"wall\" to prevent the hole collapsing. There are many other processes in which salt is involved. These include its use as a mordant in textile dying, to regenerate resins in water softening, for the tanning of hides, the preservation of meat and fish and the canning of meat and vegetables.\n\nProduction\nFood-grade salt accounts for only a small part of salt production in industrialized countries (7% in Europe), although worldwide, food uses account for 17.5% of total production.\nIn 2018, total world production of salt was 300 million tonnes, the top six producers being China (68 million), the United States (42 million), India (29 million), Germany (13 million), Canada (13 million) and Australia (12 million).\nThe manufacture of salt is one of the oldest chemical industries. A major source of salt is seawater, which has a salinity of approximately 3.5%. This means that there are about 35 g (1.2 oz) of dissolved salts, predominantly sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions, per kilogram (2.2 lbs) of water. The world's oceans are a virtually inexhaustible source of salt, and this abundance of supply means that reserves have not been calculated. The evaporation of seawater is the production method of choice in marine countries with high evaporation and low precipitation rates. Salt evaporation ponds are filled from the ocean and salt crystals can be harvested as the water dries up. Sometimes these ponds have vivid colours, as some species of algae and other micro-organisms thrive in conditions of high salinity.\nAway from the sea, salt is extracted from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These sources are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, purification was achieved in shallow open pans that were heated to accelerate evaporation. Vacuum-based methods are also employed. \nThe raw salt is refined by treatment with chemicals that precipitate most impurities, largely magnesium and calcium salts. Multiple stages of evaporation are then applied. Some salt is produced using the Alberger process, which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake. The Ayoreo, an indigenous group from the Paraguayan Chaco, obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree (Maytenus vitis-idaea) and other trees.\nThe largest mine operated by underground workings in the world is the Sifto mine, located mostly 550 meters below Lake Huron, in Goderich, Ontario (Canada). About seven million tons of salt are extracted from it annually. The  Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan has nineteen storeys, eleven of which are underground, and 400 km (250 mi) of passages. The salt is dug out by the room and pillar method, where about half the material is left in place to support the upper levels. Extraction of Himalayan salt is expected to last 350 years at the present rate of extraction of around 385,000 tons per annum. The mine is also a major tourist attraction, receiving around a quarter of a million visitors a year.\n\nIn religion\nSalt has long held an important place in religion and culture. At the time of Brahmanic sacrifices, in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks at the time of the new moon, salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and some people think this to be the origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith. \nIn Judaism, it is recommended to have either a salty bread, or to add salt to the bread if this bread is unsalted when doing Kiddush for Shabbat. It is customary to spread some salt over the bread or dip it in a little salt when passing it around the table after the Kiddush. To preserve the covenant between their people and God, Jews dip the Sabbath bread in salt. \nSalt plays a role within different Christian traditions. It is mandatory in the rite of the Tridentine Mass. Salt is used in the third item (which includes an Exorcism) of the Celtic Consecration (cf. Gallican Rite) that is employed in the consecration of a church, and it is permitted to be added to the water \"where it is customary\" in the Roman Catholic rite of Holy water. \nThe Bible makes multiple mentions of salt, both of the mineral itself and as a metaphor. Uses include the tale of how Lot's wife is turned into a pillar of salt when looking back at the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah as they are destroyed. In the New Testament, Jesus refers to his followers as the \"salt of the earth\".\nIn Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water. Salt is an auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. In Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. Salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition. When returning home from a funeral, a pinch of salt is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. In Shinto, Shio (塩, lit. \"salt\") is used for ritual purification of locations and people (harae, specifically shubatsu), and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by entrances to ward off evil and to attract patrons.\n\nReferences\n\n=== Sources ===",
          "summary": "Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl). When used in food, especially in granulated form, it is more formally called table salt. In the form of a natural crystalline mineral, salt is also known as rock salt or halite. Salt is essential for life in general (being the source of the essential dietary minerals sodium and chlorine), and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings, and is known to uniformly improve the taste perception of food. Salting, brining, and pickling are ancient and important methods of food preservation.\nSome of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6000 BC, when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt works in China dates to approximately the same period. Salt was prized by the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Hittites, Egyptians, and Indians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues, for instance triggering the El Paso Salt War which took place in El Paso in the late 1860s. Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance.\nSalt is processed from salt mines, and by the evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. The greatest single use for salt (sodium chloride) is as a feedstock for the production of chemicals. It is used to produce caustic soda and chlorine, and in the manufacture of products such as polyvinyl chloride, plastics, and paper pulp. Of the annual global production of around three hundred million tonnes, only a small percentage is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt. Table salt usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.\nSodium is an essential element for human health via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic solute. However, excessive salt consumption increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. Such health effects of salt have long been studied. Numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods. The World Health Organization recommends that adults consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium, equivalent to 5 grams of salt, per day.",

          "content": "ملح الطعام يتكون الملح المعروف بشكل رئيسي من مركب كيميائي يعرف بكلوريد الصوديوم (NaCl) والذي ينتمي لمجموعه اكبر من الاملاح. يوجد ملح الطعام في الطبيعه على هيئه بلّورات معدنيه تُعرف بالملح الصخري او الهاليت.  يوجد ملح الطعام بكثره في ماء البحار حيث هو المُكَوِّن المعدني الرَّئيسي فيه. يحتوي المحيط على قرابه 35 جرام من الملح لكل لتر (oz 1.2) وملوحه 3.5%. يُعدُّ الملح ضروريًّا لحياه الحيوان،  ويتواجد في انسجه الحيوانات اكثر من انسجه النبّاتات. لذلك فان نمط غذاء البدو المعتاد الذين يعيشون على قطعانهم لا يُحتاج فيه الى الملح او يُضاف بكميَّاتٍ قليله، بينما نظام الغذاء المعتمد على القمح يحتاج الى مكمّلات غذائيه. وتعد الملوحه احد اساسيّات حاسَّه التذوق لدى الانسان. كما ان الملح من اقدم واوفر التوابل، ويعد التمليح من اهم طرق حفظ الاطعمه.\nتشير بعض الادله الى ان معالجه الملح تعود الى 8000 سنه مضت، حيث كان سكان رومانيا يغلون مياه الينابيع لاستخراج الملح. كذلك عثر على ادوات لمعالجه الملح في الصين تعود الى نفس الفتره تقريبًا. وكان يعد الملح ثمينًا عند اليهود قديمًا وكذلك عند كل من الاغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والحيثيّين والمصريّين. اصبح الملح سلعهً ثمينهً وكان يُنقَل بالقوارب عبر البحر المتوسط من خلال طرقٍ خاصَّهٍ بُنِيَت من اجل الملح وبقوافِل عبر الصحراء الكبرى. ان عوز الملح وحاجه الدول له ادت الى نشوء حروب بينهم، واستعماله لزياده عائدات الضرائب. كما يستعمل الملح في طقوس بعض الاديان وفي بعض الثقافات.\nتتم معالجه الملح من خلال مناجم الملح، او عن طريق تبخير مياه البحار او مياه الينابيع   المليئه بالمعادن.  ان اهم المنتجات الصناعيه للملح هي الصودا الكاويه والكلور.  ويستخدم في عمليات صناعيه اخرى كتصنيع البوليفنيل كلورايد والبلاستيك واكوام الورق. ان من مجمل الانتاج السنوي للملح البالغ قرابه المئتي مليون طن يستهلك الانسان مايقارب 6% من هذا الانتاج فقط. بينما يُستخدم الباقي في عمليات معالجه الماء، وازاله الجليد عن الطرقات، وفي الزراعه. يُباع الملح القابل للاكل بهيئات مختلفه كالملح البحري، وملح الطاوله (ملح الطعام) والذي يكون معالج عاده باليود للحدّ من الاصابه بنقص اليود وكذلك يحتوي عاده على مواد مضاده للتكتل. وكذلك يوجد الملح في كثير من الاطعمه المُعالجه. يُعد الملح غذاء ضروريا، وتتاثر الصحه بمدى كميته في الغذاء. \nانّ كثره الملح قد يزيد من ضغط الدم وزياده احتماليه الاصابه بسكته او نوبه قلبيه عند بعض الاشخاص. تنصح منظمه الصحه العالميه بان يستهلك البالغون اقل من 2000 ملي جرام من الصوديوم والذي يعادل 5 جرامات من الملح يوميًّا.\n\nالتاريخ\nعرف ملح الطعام منذ القدم لخصائصه، فاستعمل في الطبخ وكحافظ للاطعمه. واستعمله الاغريق والرومان واليهود في طقوسهم الدينيه. اقتصادياً، اكتسب قيمه كبيره. استعمل في الصين والحبشه للمقايضه وكعمله. في فرنسا، استحدثت ضريبه خاصه بالملح سميت «جبل» مما اثار الناس وكانت احد اسباب الثوره الفرنسيه.\nلطالما مال الناس لبناء مجتمعاتهم حول مصادر الملح، او في مكان يستطيعون التجاره من اجله. \nوطوال التاريخ كان وجود الملح هامًّا للحضارات. فكلمه \"salary\" والتي تعني اجره اشتقت من الملح باللاتينيه;  نظرا لاستعمال الرومانيين الملحَ احيانًا كاجره، حيث كانت قيمته تعادل الذهب.  وفي بريطانيا يعد 'الملحق \"-ويتش\"wich-\" في نهايه اسماء الاماكن دلاله على كونه مصدرًا للملح في فتره من الفترات، كما في مدينتي ساندويتش ونوريتش.\n\nالتركيب الكيميائي\nيتركب الملح بشكل اساسي من المركب الايوني كلوريد الصوديوم ذي الصيغه الكيميائيه NaCl والذي يحتوي نسب متساويه من الصوديوم والكلور.. ويحتوي ملح البحر والملح المستخرج من المناجم (غالبا ما يكون مصدره ماء البحر من بحار عصر ما قبل التاريخ) على العناصر الزهيده (والمفيده بكميات قليله لبعض الحيوانات والنباتات). تتم معالجه الملح المستخرج من المناجم (الملح المعدني) واستخدامه في انتاج ملح الطعام (ملح الطاوله) عن طريق اذابته في الماء وتنقيته من خلال ترسيب باقي المعادن واخراجها من المحلول ثم اعاده تبخيره. وغالبا ما يضاف اليود بعد هذه المعالجه. ان بلورات الملح شافَّه (شبه شفافه) غالبا ومكعبه الشكل، وتبدو بيضاء بالغالب لكن قد تعطيها بعض الشوائب لونا ازرق او ارجواني. تساوي الكتله الموليه للملح 58.443 جم\\مول، ودرجه ذوبانه تساوي 801°م وتساوي درجه غليانه 1465°م. كما تساوي كثافته 2017 جم\\سم3. يُعد الملح سريع الذوبان في الماء ومعدل ذائبيته تساوي 359 جم\\لتر، وعندما يُذاب الملح فيه فانه ينفصل الى ايون الصوديوم +Na وايون الكلوريد - Cl. ان تبلور محلول الماء والملح يُنتج ثنائي الهيدرات NaCl•2H2O. كما ان محاليل كلوريد الصوديوم مع الماء لها خصائص مختلفه عن المياه النقيه; حيث تنخفض درجه التجمد الى -21.12 °م عند كون كتله الملح 23.31% من المحلول، ودرجه الذوبان لمحلول ملح مشبع تساوي تقريبا 108.7°م.\n\nملح الطعام\nيعد الملح هامًّا لصحه الانسان والحيوان ويستخدم في مناطق كثيره من العالم كتوابل. كما تعد الملوحه اهم حواس التذوق الخمسه الاساسيه.\nملح الطعام هو ملح معالج يتكون 97%-%99 منه من كلوريد الصوديوم (NaCl) بالاضافه غالبا الى موانع تكتُّل مثل الومينوسيليكات الصوديوم او كربونات المغنيسيوم لِتسهَّل من تدفقه. يتوافر الملح المعالج باليود والذي يحتوي يوديد الصوديوم في دول كثيره˛ كما يضاف له مجفف احيانًا كحبوب الارز او البسكويت المملح ليساعد على امتصاص الرطوبه وتكسير تكتلات الملح التي قد تنتج منها.\n\nالملح المدعَّم\nتتواجد بعض الاضافات في بعض انواع ملح الطعام وذلك لتكميل النواقص الغذائيه لتفادي بعض الامراض وخاصه في الدول الناميه. تختلف انواع وكميات المواد المضافه من دوله لاخرى. يعد اليود من الاغذيه المُحتاجه بكميَّات قليله̨ ونقص في كميه هذا العنصر قد تؤدي الى انخفاض انتاج الثيروكسين (احد هرمونات الغده الدرقيه) وبالتالي تحدث حاله قصور الدرقيه وتضخم في هذه الغدَّه مما قد ينتج الفدامه عند الاطفال. بدا استعمال الملح المعالج باليود لتفادي هذه الحالات منذ عام 1924 م. ويتكون هذا الملح من ملح الطعام مع كميات قليله من يوديد البوتاسيوم او يوديد الصوديوم او يودات الصوديوم. كما قد يضاف سكّر احادي يعرف بالدكستروز ليساعد على تثبيت وتوازن اليود. تُقدر حالات نقص اليود بالعالم الى حوالي مئتي مليون شخص˛ وهو المسبب الاول الذي من الممكن تفاديه للتخلف العقلي. كما كان استخدام الملح المعالج باليود فعّالا لتفادي حالات نقص اليود.\nتختلف كميه اليود ومركباته من دوله لاخرى فالملح المعالج في الولايات المتحده يحتوي على 46-77 جزيء من مليون جزيء˛ حيث تنصح هيئه الغذاء والدواء الامريكيه بتناول 150 مايكروجرام من اليود يوميًّا لكل من الذكور والاناث. بينما الكميه الموصى بوضعها في الملح في المملكه المتحده هي 10-22 جزيء من المليون.\nيضاف حديدوسيانيد الصوديوم احيانا مع ملح الطعام كمانع للتكتل. ويعد امنًا للبشر بكميات قليله حيث تم قبول ادله عدم سميته كاضافه غذائيه من قبل مجلس السموم عام 1988م. بدا استعمال موانع التكتل عام 1911م عندما استخدم كربونات المغنيسيوم لتسهيل حركه الملح. تستعمل احيانا بعض موانع التكتل الاخرى كفوسفات ثلاثي الكالسيوم ̨ كربونات المغنيسيوم او الكالسيوم الملح الحمضي˛ اكسيد المغنيسيوم ˛ ثاني اكسيد السليكون ˛ سيليكات الكالسيوم ̨ الومينيوسيليكات الصوديوم، والومينيوسيليكات الكالسيوم. كل من الاتحاد الاوروبي وهيئه الغذاء والدواء الامريكيه سمحا باستعمال الالومنيوم مع المركبين الاخيرتي الذكر.\nيضاف كل من ملح الحديد وملح اليوديد في ما يسمى بتدعيم الملح الثنائي. تكمن فائده ملح الحديد لتجنب فقر الدم الناجم عن عوز الحديد والذي يؤثر على النمو الذهني فيما يقارب 40% من الرضَّع في الدول الناميه. يعد فومارات الحديد الثنائي هو المصدر الرئيسي للحديد.  احد الاضافات المهمه الاخرى وخاصه للحوامل هي حمض الفوليك (فيتامين ب 9) والذي يعطي لونا اصفرا لملح الطعام. يساعد حمض الفوليك بالوقايه من عيب الانبوب العصبي وفقر الدم.\nيعد كذلك نقص الفلورين في الحميه سببا لكثير من الاصابات بتسوس الاسنان. قد تضاف املاح الفلوريد الى ملح الطعام بهدف تقليل الاصابه بتسوس الاسنان وخاصه في الدول التي لم تستفد من اضاقه الفلور الى الماء او معجون الاسنان. ويعد هذا الفعل منتشرًا اكثر في الدول التي لا تضيف الفلور الى ماء الشرب. 35% من ملح الطعام في فرنسا يحتوي على فلوريد الصوديوم.\n\nانواع اخرى\nيحتوي الملح غير المعالج على كمّيات قليله من المغنيسيوم وهاليدات الكالسيوم والكبريت واثار منتجات الطحالب والجسيمات المترسبه وكذلك بعض البكتيريا المحبه للملوحه. يعطي الكالسيوم والمغنيسيوم قليلا من الطعم المر، ويعطيان الملح خاصيه الاسترطاب (امتصاص الماء تدريجيا من الجو). تساهم منتجات الطحالب قليلا باعطاء الملح رائحه شبيهه بالبحر او السمك؛ لوجود مركبات البرومين العضويه. اما الجسيمات المترسبه فتعطيه مظهرا رصاصيا باهتا. ونظرًا لاستطاعه الانسان شم وتذوق المركبات ذات الكميات الصغيره، فان الملح البحري عاده ما يكون ذا طعم اكثر تعقيدا من كلوريد الصوديوم النقي. وتشير الدراسات التابعه للملح الصخري بان الملح البحري او الصخري اللذان لم يعالجان لا يحتويان على كميه اليود الكافيه للوقايه من امراض نقص اليود. \nيختلف طعم ومدى ملوحه الملح الطبيعي باختلاف مصدره، مما يعطي نكهه خاصه له. ولزهره الملح (ملح بحري يكون على سطح محاليل الملح المشبعه في الملَّاحات) طعم فريد يختلف من مكان لاخر حسب منطقه استخراجها. في احد الاطباق الكوريه التقليديه والذي يدعى بملح الخيزران يُجهَّز الطبق بتحميص الملح في حاويه من خيزران، وتغلق كلتا نهايتي الحاويه بالطين، حيث يمتص الملح المُحمَّص المعادن من الخيزران والطين. وهناك بعض الادعاءات ان هذا الطبق يزيد من خاصيتي منع تكسير الكروموسومات ومنع الطفرات الجينيه الموجوده في طبق الدوينجانغ الكوري (عجينه فول الصويا المخمره). \nلايحتوي ملح الكوشير على اليود على الرغم من معالجته، وحجم حباته اكبر من اغلب الاملاح المعالجه. مما قد يعطي خصائص مختلفه عند استخدامه بالطبخ، حيث يستعمل لتحضير لحم الكوشر. وليست كل المنتجات المصنفه كملح كوشير هي كذلك فعلًا بل يجب ان توثَّق من حاخام بانها تطابق المتطلبات اللازمه لوصفها بذلك.\n\nالملح في الاطعمه\nيتواجد الملح بشكل طبيعي في كثير من المواد الغذائيه كاللحوم والخضروات والفواكه، لكن بكميات صغيره. وغالبا ما يضاف الملح للمواد الغذائيه المعالجه كالاطعمه المعلبه والمخلَّلات والوجبات الخفيفه. حيث يستعمل لحفظ الطعام ولاضافه نكهه عند الاكل. تستخدم املاح الالبان في تحضير كل من الزبده والاجبان. كان الملح احد اهم طرق حفظ الطعام قبل اختراع اجهزه التبريد الالكترونيه. فيحتوي سمك الرنجه 67 ملي جرام من الصوديوم لكل 100 جرام بينما يحتوي بعد تمليحه على 990 ملي جرام. وكذلك لحم الخنزير يحتوي على 63 ملي جرام بينما يحتوي بعد تمليحه على 1480 ملي جرام، اما البطاطس فيحتوي على 7 ملي جرام اما رقائق البطاطس المقليه فتحتوي على 800 ملي جرام لكل 100 جرام. ان مصادر الملح الطبيعيه دون الاستعمال المباشر لكلوريد الصوديوم هي الخبز ومنتجات القمح واللحوم والحليب ومشتقاته.\nلا يضاف الملح كتوابل في كثير من دول شرق اسيا، وانما يتم استعمال صلصه الصويا او صلصه السمك او صلصه المحار واللاتي يحتوين على كميه عاليه من الصوديوم حيث يعدن بديلا لملح الطعام المستخدم في المجتمعات الغربيه، وغالبا ما تضاف هذه الصلصات مع الطهي وليس بعده.\n\nالنظام الغذائي والصحه\nتعد كميه الصوديوم قرابه 40% من كتله ملح الطعام، حيث يحتوي 6 جرام من الملح (ملعقه صغيره) على ما يقارب 2300 ملي جرام من الصوديوم. للصوديوم دور مهم في جسم الانسان حيث يساعد الاعصاب والعضلات على القيام بمهمتها بالشكل الصحيح، وكذلك يعد احد العوامل المهمه لتنظيم الماء والسوائل داخل الجسم. يعد الملح مصدر الصوديوم الاساسي في المجتمعات الغربيه، وكميه استهلاكهم للملح تعادل 10 جرام يوميًّا مما يعد اكثر من اغلب دول اسيا وشرق اوروبا. ان لمستويات الصوديوم العاليه في كثير من الاطعمه المعالجه اثرًا على الكميه الكليَّه المستهلكه. حيث 77% من الصوديوم المستهلك في الولايات المتحده مصدره وجبات المطاعم والاغذيه المعالجه، و11% من اضافه ملح الطعام، اما الباقي فيكون متواجد بشكل طبيعي في الغذاء.\nيُعد الاكثار من الملح مضرًّا للصحه وتوصي منظمه الصحه العالميه بتقليل استهلاك الملح. يرتبط زياده استهلاك الملح مع ارتفاع خطوره الاصابه بسكته والامراض القلبيه الوعائيه بشكل عام. يعد تقليل استهلاك الملح بمقدار 1000 ملي جرام مساعدًا على تقليل احتماليه الاصابه بالامراض القلبيه الوعائيه بما يقارب 30%. تقليل كميات الصوديوم المستهلكه عاده بشكلٍ عالٍ في الاشخاص الذين لا يعانون من امراض حاده يساعد على خفض ضغط الدم وتكون النتائج افضل عند المصابين بفرط ضغط الدم. وعلى الرغم من ذلك لا توجد اثار واضحه للتوصيات بتقليل استهلاك الصوديوم.\nتوصي منظمه الصحه العالميه ان يكون استهلاك الاشخاص البالغين اقل من 2000 ملي جرام من الصوديوم يوميًّا (ما يقارب 5 ملي جرام من الملح). وتوصي ارشادات الولايات المتحده الامريكيه لعام 2010 م ان لا يتجاوز استهلاك كل من المصابين بفرط ضغط الدم والامريكيين من اصل افريقي ومتوسطي العمر وكبار السن 1500 ملي جرام من الصوديوم يوميًّا وان يكملوا احتياجات الجسم للبوتاسيوم حيث تنص التوصيات على اخذ 4700 ملي جرام يوميًّا والمتواجده في الخضروات والفواكه.\nوافاده تقليل استهلاك الصوديوم بشكل كبير هي مساله مُختلف عليها. حيث يوصي تقرير لعام 2013 بالا يقلَّ استهلاك الفرد عن 1200 ملي جرام من الصوديوم يوميًّا (3 جرام من الملح). بينما ينص تقريرين لعام 2013 وعام 2015 على عدم وجود دليل كافٍ على ان تقليل الصوديوم اقل من 2300 ملي جرام يوميًّا ذا فائده. وقد يكون النظام الغذائي ذا الصوديوم القليل اضرّ من النظام الغذائي الذي يحتوي على مستوى صوديوم مرتفع قليلًا. ويشكك البعض في الترابط بين استعمال الملح في الاكل والامراض القلبيه الوعائيه عند عامه الناس.\n\nالملح في غير الاطعمه\nقرابه 6% فقط من الملح المنتج يستخدم للغذاء. اما الباقي ف 12% تستخدم في معالجه وازاله قساوه الماء، و8% تستخدم لازاله الجليد عن الطرقات و6% تستخدم في الزراعه. اما الباقي (68%) فيستخدم في العمليات الصناعيه، حيث يعد كلوريد الصوديوم من اكثر المواد الخام غير العضويه المستعمله في الصناعه. واهم منتجات كلوريد الصوديوم هي الصودا الكاويه والكلور، وتتم عمليه فصل كلوريد الصوديوم عن طريق عمليه التحليل الكهربائي لمحلول ملح نقي. وتستعمل هذه المنتجات في تصنيع كلوريد متعدد الفاينيل ومنتجات البلاستيك ولب الورق بالاضافه لمنتجات اخرى عضويه وغير عضويه. يستخدم كذلك الملح كقالب لتصنيع الالومنيوم؛ لذلك توجد طبقه من الملح الذائب تطفو فوق المعدن الذائب وتزيل الحديد والمعادن المُلوِّثه الاخرى. ويستخدم بالاضافه الى ذلك في تصنيع الصابون والجلسرين حيث يضاف الى وعاء لترسيب المنتجات المُتَصَبِّنَه. ويستخدم ايضًا في تصنيع المطاط الاصطناعي، والخزف حيث يتبخر الملح ويتكثف على سطح السيراميك منتجا لمعه في عمليه تعرف بتزجيج الخزف.\nيُضاف الملح الى سائل الحفر عند حفر ماده رخوه كالرمل او الحصى لمنح دعامه ومنع ما حول الحفره من الانهيار. يستخدم كذلك في عمليات عديده: كترسيخ الالوان عند صبغ النسيج، واعاده تكوين الراتنج في عمليه ازاله قساوه الماء، ودباغه الجلود، وتعليب اللحوم والخضروات.\n\nالانتاج\nيعد انتاج الملح من اقدم الصناعات الكيميائيه. واحد اهم المصادر له هو ماء البحر الذي تساوي ملوحته تقريبا 3,5% والذي يعني ان يوجد 35 جم من الملح المُذاب لكل كجم من ماء البحر. تعتبر المحيطات مصدر ملح غير ناضب وبسبب هذه الوفره في المصادر فانه لم يتم حساب مخزون الملح. ويعد تبخير ماء البحر هو الخيار المثالي لانتاج الملح للمدن الساحليه ذات مدى تبخّر عالٍ وترسب منخفض. تمتلئ الملّاحات بماء المحيطات ومن الممكن حصد بلورات الملح بعد جفاف الماء. تمتلك هذه المحاليل الوانا بارزه نظرًا لوجود بعض انواع الطحالب والمخلوقات المجهريه المحبه للملوحه والتي تنمو في هذه البيئه.\n\nالملح في الاديان\nلطالما كان للملح مكانه مهمه في كثير من الاديان والثقافات. يُرمى الملح عاده على النار لاصدار بعض الضجيج والفرقعه في الديانه الفيديه وفي بعض طقوس الحيثيِّين واحتفالات الساميين والاغريق عند حلول الاشهر القمريه. كان المصريون القدماء والاغريق الرومان يتقربون الى الهتهم بتقريب الملح والماء، ويعتقد البعض ان هذا منشا واصل الماء المقدس في المعتقد المسيحي. وعند الازتيك كانت يوكسيسواتل (Huixtocihuatl) الهه الاخصاب والتي تستجيب عند تقريب الماء والملح، كما تسمى بالهه الملح.\nوقد روى ابن ماجه في سننه من حديث انس بن مالك رضي الله عنه ان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال: سيد ادامكم الملح. (ضعَّفه الالباني.)\nويعد الملح في الهندوسيه مبشِّرًا وجالبا للحظ حيث كان يستعمل في بعض الطقوس الدينيه وعند الزواج. اما معتنقي ديانه الجاينيه فيقدمون ارزا غير مطبوخ مع قليل من الملح للالهه كي يثبتوا مدى التزامهم بهذا الدين، وكذلك فانهم ينثرون الملح على بقايا جثه الميت بعد حرقها قبل دفن الرماد. كما يعتقد معتنقو الماهايانيه بان الملح يطرد الارواح الشريره، فعند عودتهم من المقبره ينثرون بعضا من الملح على كتفهم الايسر لطرد هذه الارواح ومنعها من دخول المنزل. وفي بعض الطقوس الشنتويه فان الملح يستخدم في تطهير الاماكن والاشخاص وتوضع اكوام الملح على اطباق عند مداخل المؤسسات طردا للارواح الشريره وجلبا لاصحاب الاموال.\nوفي الكتاب العبري (التوراه) ذُكر الملح قرابه 35 مره، احدهم في قصه زوجه لوط - عليه السلام- حيث حوِّلت الى عمود ملح عندما التفتت الى قريتي سدوم وعموره عند تدميرهما (سفر التكوين). وكما قام القاضي ابو معيلق عند تدميره مدينه شكيم برش الملح كلعنه على من يسكن هذه الارض مره اخرى. وفي سفر ايوب تم ذكر الملح للمره الاولى كبهارات. وفي كتب العهد الجديد ذكر الملح ست مرات ويذكرون بان المسيح اشار لاتباعه بانهم «ملح الارض». كما يستخدم الملح عند طرد الارواح الشريره، واحيانا يُضاف للماء ويستعمل عند ترسيم الكهنه.\nوعند اليهود فيجب تواجد كل من الماء والملح عند المذبح، وفي طقوس واحتفالات اخرى.\n\nانظر ايضًا\nبدائل الملح\nمستنقعات الملح",
