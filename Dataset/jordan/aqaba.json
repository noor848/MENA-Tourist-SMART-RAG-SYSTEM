      "content": "Aqaba (English:   AK-ə-bə, US also  AHK-; Arabic: الْعَقَبَة, romanized: al-ʿAqaba, pronounced [ælˈʕæqɑba, ælˈʕæɡæba]) is the only coastal city in Jordan and the largest and most populous city on the Gulf of Aqaba. Situated in southernmost Jordan, Aqaba is the administrative center of the Aqaba Governorate. The city had a population of 148,398 in 2015 and a land area of 375 square kilometres (144.8 sq mi). Aqaba has significant trade and tourism. The Port of Aqaba also serves other countries in the region.\nAqaba's strategic location at the northeastern tip of the Red Sea between the continents of Asia and Africa has made its port important for thousands of years. The ancient city was called Elath, known in Latin as Aela) and in Arabic as Ayla. Its strategic location and proximity to copper mines made it a regional hub for copper production and trade in the Chalcolithic period.\nAela became a bishopric under Byzantine rule and later became a Latin Catholic titular see after Islamic conquest around AD 650, when it became known as Ayla; the name Aqaba is late medieval. In the Great Arab Revolt's Battle of Aqaba Arab forces defeated the Ottoman defenders.\nAqaba's location next to Wadi Rum and Petra has made it one of the major tourist attractions in Jordan. The city is administered by the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, which has turned Aqaba into a low-tax, duty-free city, attracting several mega projects like Ayla Oasis, Saraya Aqaba, Marsa Zayed and expansion of the Port of Aqaba. They are expected to turn the city into a major tourism hub in the region. However, industrial and commercial activities remain important, due to the strategic location of the city as the country's only seaport. The city sits right across the border from Eilat, likewise Israel's only port on the Red Sea. After the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, there were plans and hopes of establishing a trans-border tourism and economic area, but few of those plans have come to fruition.\n\nName\nIn antiquity, the name of the city was Elath or Ailath. The name is presumably derived from the Semitic name of a tree in the genus Pistacia. Modern Eilat (established 1947), situated about 5 km (3.1 mi) north-west of Aqaba, also takes its name from the ancient settlement. In the Hellenistic period, it was renamed Berenice (Ancient Greek: Βερενίκη Bereníkē), but the original name survived, and under Roman rule was re-introduced in the forms Aila, Aela or Haila, adopted in Byzantine Greek as Αἴλα Aíla and in Arabic as Ayla (آيلا). The crusaders called the city Elyn.\nThe present name comes from the identically-named Gulf of Aqaba, named that as early as 150 A.D. (or somewhat later, if added by a subsequent editor), as evidenced by the plotting of a Mt. Acabe ('Ακάβη όρος) in Ptolemy's Geography, which mountain is shown directly across from the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, on the western coast of the Red Sea, probably somewhere in the vicinity of modern Hurghada, Egypt, and ancient Mons Claudianus, both of which placenames could also themselves be derived cognate forms of the word Aqaba, the former by morphological drift, the latter as a translation into Latin, wherein \"Claudianus\" also suggests limping or stumbling, a perfect semantic overlap for the literal Arabic meaning of \"Aqaba\" (عقبة), as an \"obstacle,\" \"stumbling block,\" or \"spine.\"  Thus the Gulf of Aqaba may've in turn gotten its name from this older region, West of it, around Mt. Acabe (not necessarily a single identifiable mountain), construed as the rough spine of highland that must be crossed, to pass thru the natural trade corridor there, from the Upper Nile to the Red Sea, along modern Egyptian Highway 60.  \nThis name first became mentioned in connection with the city itself of Aqaba, in the 12th century, as ʿaqabat Aylah (عقبة آيلة, 'the mountain-pass of Ayla'), mentioned by Idrisi, at a time when the settlement had been mostly reduced to a military stronghold, properly referring to the pass just to the north-east of the settlement (29.559°N 35.095°E﻿ / 29.559; 35.095, now traversed by the Jordanian Aqaba Highway).\n\nHistory\nNearby Chalcolithic sites\nExcavations at two tells (archaeological mounds) Tall Hujayrat Al-Ghuzlan and Tall Al-Magass, both a few kilometres north of modern-day Aqaba city, revealed inhabited settlements from c. 4000 BC during the Chalcolithic period, with thriving copper production on a large scale. This period is largely unknown due to the absence of written historical sources. University of Jordan \narchaeologists have discovered the sites, where they found a small building whose walls were inscribed with human and animal drawings, suggesting that the building was used as a religious site. The people who inhabited the site had developed an extensive water system in irrigating their crops which were mostly made up of grapes, olives and wheat. Several different-sized clay pots were also found suggesting that copper production was a major industry in the region, the pots being used in melting the copper and reshaping it. Scientific studies performed on-site revealed that it had undergone two earthquakes, with the latter one leaving the site completely destroyed.\n\nEarly history\nElath\nThe Edomites, who ruled over Edom just south of the Dead Sea, are believed to have built the first port in Aqaba called Elath around 1500 BC, turning it into a major hub for the trade of copper as the Phoenicians helped them develop their maritime economy. They profited from its strategic location at the junction of trading routes between Asia and Africa.\n\nTell el-Kheleifeh\nArchaeologists have investigated an Iron Age settlement at Tell el-Kheleifeh, immediately west of Aqaba, inhabited between the 8th and 4th centuries BCE.\n\nUndefined\nAround 735 BC, the city was conquered by the Assyrian empire. Because of the wars the Assyrians were fighting in the east, their trading routes were diverted to the city and the port witnessed relative prosperity. The Babylonians conquered it in 600 BC. During this time, Elath witnessed great economic growth, which is attributed to the business background of its rulers who realized how important the city's location was. The Persian Achaemenid Empire took the city in 539 BC.\n\nClassical antiquity\nHellenistic period\nThe city continued to grow and prosper which made it a major trading hub by the time of the Greek rule by 300 BC, after the Wars of Alexander the Great, it was described by a Greek historian to be \"one of the most important trading cities in the Arab World\". The Ptolemaic Greeks called it Berenice.\nThe Nabatean kingdom had its capital north of the city, at Petra.\n\nRoman period\nIn 64 BC, following the Roman conquest, they annexed the city and called it Aela (also Haila, Aelana, in Greek rendered Αἴλα Aila).\nBoth Petra and Aela were under strong Nabatean influence despite the Roman rule. Aela reached its peak during Roman times, the great long-distance road the Via Traiana Nova led south from Bostra through Amman, terminating in Aela, where it connected with a west road leading to the Paralia and Roman Egypt.\nAround AD 106 Aela was one of the main ports for the Romans.\n\nLate Roman and Byzantine periods\nThe Aqaba Church was constructed under Roman rule between 293 and 303 and is considered to be the oldest known purpose-built Christian church in the world. By the time of Eusebius, Aela became the garrison of the Legio X Fretensis, which was moved to Aela from Jerusalem.\n\nOne of the oldest known texts written in the Arabic alphabet is a late 4th-century inscription found in Jabal Ram 50 kilometres (31 miles) east of Aqaba.\nThe city became a Christian bishopric at an early stage. Its bishop Peter was present at the First Council of Nicaea, the first ecumenical council, in 325. Beryllus was at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and Paul at the synod called by Patriarch Peter of Jerusalem in 536 against Patriarch Anthimus I of Alexandria, a council attended by bishops of the Late Roman provinces of Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda and Palaestina Tertia, to the last-named of which Aela belonged.\nA citadel was also built in the area that became the focal point of the Roman southern defense system.\nIn the 6th century, Procopius of Caesarea mentioned a Jewish population in Eilat and its surroundings which enjoyed autonomy until the time of Justinian I (r. 527–565).\nAccording to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad himself reached Aila during the expedition of Tabuk of 630, and extracted tribute from the city.\nDuring the Late Byzantine or even Early Muslim period, Aila was the origin of what came to be known as the Ayla-Axum amphoras.\n\nEarly Muslim Ayla\nAila fell to the Islamic armies by 629, and the ancient settlement was left to decay, while a new Arab city was established outside its walls under Uthman ibn Affan, known as Ayla (Arabic: آيلا).\nThe Early Muslim city was excavated in 1986 by a team from the University of Chicago. Artefacts are now on exhibit at Aqaba Archaeological Museum and Jordan Archaeological Museum in Amman. The fortified city was inscribed in a rectangle of 170 by 145 metres (558 ft × 476 ft), with walls 2.6 metres (8 ft 6 in) thick and 4.5 metres (14 ft 9 in) high, surrounding a fortified structure, occupying an area of 35 by 55 metres (115 ft × 180 ft). 24 towers defended the city. The city had four gates on all four sides, defining two main lines intersecting at the centre. The intersection of these two thoroughfares was indicated by a tetrapylon (a four-way arch), which was later transformed into a luxury residential building decorated with frescoes dated to the tenth century. This type of urban structure, known as a misr (pl. amsar), is typical of early Islamic fortified settlements.\n\nThe city prospered from 661 to 750 under the Umayyads and beyond under the Abbasids (750–970) and the Fatimids (970–1116). Ayla took advantage of its key position as an important step on the road to India and Arab spices (frankincense, myrrh), between the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian Peninsula. The city is also mentioned in several stories of the Arabian Nights.\nThe geographer Shams Eddin Muqaddasi describes Ayla as nearby the ruined ancient city.\nThe city was mentioned in Medieval Arabic sources as having a mixed population of Jews and Christians. It subsequently became an important station for pilgrim caravans on the way to Mecca.\nThe city was \"completely destroyed\" by the 1068 Near East earthquake.\n\nCrusader/Ayyubid and Mamluk periods\nBaldwin I of Jerusalem took over the city in 1115 without encountering much resistance. The centre of the city then moved to 500 meters along the coast to the south, and the crusader fortress of Elyn was built, which allowed the Kingdom of Jerusalem to dominate all roads between Damascus, Egypt, and Arabia, protecting the Crusader states from the east and allowing for profitable raids on trade caravans passing through the area. In order to secure this strategic position, Baldwin also built and garrisoned a fortress on Pharaoh's Island (called Île de Graye by the Franks), the modern Jazīrat Fir'aun in Egyptian territorial waters about 7 kilometres (4.3 miles) west of Aqaba.\nThe garrison of Elyn (now serving primarily as a military outpost) was further strengthened in 1142 by Pagan the Butler, Lord of Oultrejourdain, who pursued an ambitious program of castle building throughout his domain. However, there was no large-scale settlement of Europeans in the area, and the region between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba remained mainly inhabited by Bedouins, who were obliged to pay tribute to the Lordship of Oultrejourdain. Despite all efforts to fortify the region, the city was captured in 1170 by a squadron sent by Saladin as he was besieging Gaza; while it was successfully raided by Raynald of Châtillon in 1182, it was never retaken by the Crusaders.\nThe old fort was rebuilt, as Aqaba Fortress, by Mamluk sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh Al-Ghuri in the early 16th century. For the next four centuries, the site was a simple fishing village of little importance.\n\nModern history\nDuring World War I, the Ottoman forces were forced to withdraw from Aqaba in 1917 after the Battle of Aqaba, led by T. E. Lawrence and the Arab forces of Auda Abu Tayi and Sherif Nasir. The capture of Aqaba allowed the British to supply the Arab forces. In 1918, the regions of Aqaba and Ma'an were officially incorporated into the Kingdom of the Hejaz. In 1925, Ibn Saud the ruler of Nejd with the help of his Wahhabi Ikhwan troops successfully annexed the Hejaz, but gave up the Ma'an and Aqaba to the British protectorate of Transjordan.\n\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 8,908 inhabitants in 'Aqaba.\nIn 1965, King Hussein, through an exchange deal with Saudi Arabia, gave 6,000 square kilometres (2,317 square miles) of desert land in Jordanian territories in exchange for other territories, including 12 kilometres (7 miles) of an extension of prime coastline south of Aqaba, which included the Yamanieh coral reef. Aqaba was a major site for imports of Iraqi goods in the 1980s until the Persian Gulf War.\nIn 1997, the Aqaba Marine Reserve was established within the southern boundaries of the Gulf of Aqaba.\n\nGeography\nThe city lies at Jordan's southernmost point, on the Gulf of Aqaba lying at the tip of the Red Sea. Its strategic location is shown in the fact that it is located at the crossroads of the continents of Asia and Africa, while bordering Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\nClimate\nAqaba has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with mild, sometimes warm winters and very hot dry summers. Subzero temperatures can be observed every few years. The record high temperature of 49.6 °C (121.3 °F) was registered on 14 August 2025 . The record low temperature of −3.9 °C (25.0 °F) was on January 16, 2008, as in Eilat.\n\nLocal government\nIn August 2000, the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA) was established which acted as the statutory institution empowered with administrative, fiscal, regulatory and economic responsibilities.\n\nAdministrative divisions\nJordan is divided into 12 administrative divisions, each called a Governorate. Aqaba Governorate divides into 3 Districts, some of which are divided into Subdistricts and further divided into villages.\n\nEconomy\nWith status as Jordan's special economic zone, Aqaba's economy is based on the tourism and port industry sectors.\nAqaba's location next to Wadi Rum and Petra has strengthened the city's location on the world map and made it one of the major tourist attractions in Jordan. The city is administered by the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, which has turned Aqaba into a low-tax, duty-free city, attracting several mega projects like Ayla Oasis, Saraya Aqaba, Marsa Zayed and expansion of the Port of Aqaba. They are expected to turn the city into a major tourism hub in the region. Industrial and commercial activities remain important, due to the strategic location of the city as the country's only seaport.\nAqaba is the only seaport of Jordan so virtually all of Jordan's exports depart from here. Heavy machinery industry is also flourishing in the city with regional assembly plants being located in Aqaba such as the Land Rover Aqaba Assembly Plant. \nBy 2008 the ASEZ had attracted $18bn in committed investments, beating its $6bn target by 2020 by a third and more in less than a decade. The goal was adjusted to bring in another $12bn by 2020, but in 2009 alone, deals worth $14bn were inked. Some projects currently under construction are:\n\nMarsa Zayed a $10 billion is the largest mega mixed-use development project ever envisioned in both Jordan and the region. Marsa Zayed will host facilities including residential neighborhoods, commercial outlets and amenities, entertainment venues, financial and business facilities, and a number of hotels. Additionally, the property will feature marinas and a cruise ship terminal. Marsa Zayed will encompass 6.4 million square meters of built-up property.\nSaraya Aqaba, a $1.5 billion resort with a man made lagoon, luxury hotels, villas, and townhouses that will be completed by 2017.\nAyla Oasis, a $1.5 billion resort around a man made lagoon with hotels, villas, an 18-hole golf course designed by Greg Norman.  It also has an Arabian Venice theme with apartment buildings built along canals only accessible by walkway or boat. This project will be completed by 2017.\nTala Bay, Tala Bay was developed in a distinctive architectural style that blends Jordanian and regional architecture with total cost of US$680 million.  Another distinguishing feature of this single community resort is its two-kilometer private sandy beach on the Red Sea.\nThe Red Sea Astrarium (TRSA), the world's only Star Trek themed park, worth $1.5 billion would have been completed by 2014 but cancelled in 2015.\nPort relocation. Aqaba's current port will be relocated to the southernmost part of the province near the Saudi border. Its capacity will surpass that of the current port.  The project costs $5 billion, and it will be completed by 2013.\nAqaba will be connected by the national rail system which will be completed by 2013.  The rail project will connect Aqaba with all Jordan's main cities and economic centers and several countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Syria.\nThe Aqaba Container Terminal (ACT) handled a record 587,530 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in 2008, an increase of 41.6% on the previous year. To accommodate the rise in trade on the back of the increasing popularity of container shipping and the stabilising political situation in Iraq, the Aqaba Development Corporation (ADC) has announced plans for a new port. The port relocation 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the south will cost an estimated $600m and will improve infrastructure, while freeing up space for development in the city. Plans for upgrading the King Hussein International Airport (KHIA) and the development of a logistics centre will also help position Aqaba as a regional hub for trade and transport.\n\nTourism\nAqaba has a number of luxury hotels, including in the Tala Bay resort 20 kilometres (12 miles) further to the south, which service those who come for fun on the beaches as well as Scuba diving. Aqaba offers more than thirty primary diving locations, with the majority of them accommodating divers of all skill levels. These diving sites comprise fringing reefs that extend for over 25 kilometres (16 miles), reaching all the way to the border with Saudi Arabia.\nIt also offers activities which take advantage of its desert location.  Its many coffee shops offer mansaf and knafeh, and baqlawa desserts. Another very popular venue is the Turkish Bath (Hamam) built in 306 AD, in which locals and visitors alike come to relax after a hot day.\n\nIn 2006, the Tourism Division of the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA) reported that the number of tourists visiting the Zone in 2006 rose to about 432,000, an increase of 5% over previous year. Approximately 65%, or 293,000 were Jordanians. Of foreign tourists, Europeans visited the Zone in the largest numbers, with about 98,000 visiting during the year. The division has financed tourism advertising and media campaigns with the assistance of the European Union.\nAqaba has been chosen for the site of a new waterfront building project that would rebuild Aqaba with new man-made water structures, new high-rise residential and office buildings, and more tourist services to place Aqaba on the investment map and challenge other centers of waterfront development throughout the region.\nAqaba was chosen as the Arab Tourism City of 2011.\nDuring the 5-day holiday at both the end of Ramadan and Eid Al-Adha, Jordanian and western expats flock into the city with numbers reaching up to 50,000 visitors. During this time the occupancy rate of most hotels there reaches as high as 90%, and are often fully booked.\nThe several development projects (i.e. Ayla, Saraya etc.) now taking place in Aqaba provide \"opportunities of empowerment\" for local populations that want to expand their agency within the city. According to Fulbright scholar Kimberly Cavanagh development projects will help exhibit the ways global- local partnerships and the resultant cultural exchanges,  can result in mutually beneficial outcomes.\n\nDemographics\nThe city of Aqaba has one of the highest population growth rates in Jordan in 2011, and only 44% of the buildings in the city had been built before 1990. A special census for Aqaba city was carried by the Jordanian department of statistics in 2007, the total population of Aqaba by the census of 2007 was 98,400.  The 2011 population estimate is 136,200. The results of the census compared to the national level are indicated as follows:\n\nReligion\nِIslam represents the majority of the population of Aqaba, but Christianity still exists today. Approximately 5,000 Christian families live in the city. There are several churches in the city and multiple Christian schools including Rosary Sisters School Aqaba.\n\nCityscape\nResidential buildings in Aqaba are made up of 4 stories, of which are covered with sandstone or limestone. The city has no high-rises; however, Marsa Zayed project is planned to dramatically change that reality through the construction of several high-rise towers that host hotels, residential units, offices and clinics.\n\nCulture\nMuseums\nThe largest museum in Aqaba is the Aqaba Archaeological Museum.\n\nLifestyle\nAqaba has recently experienced a great growth in its nightlife, especially during the dramatic increase of tourist number in the 2000s.\n\nTransport\nRail\nThe Aqaba railway which transported phosphate to the old port ceased operations in 2018. A successor line to transport phosphate from Al Shidiya and Ghor es-Safi to the new terminal in Port of Aqaba is planned through an agreement between Jordan's Ministry for Transport and Etihad Rail.\nThere has been propositions to connect Eilat to Aqaba by rail.\n\nAirports\nKing Hussein International Airport is the only civilian airport outside of Amman in the country, located to the north of Aqaba. It is a 20-minutes drive away from the city center. Regular flights are scheduled from Amman to Aqaba with an average flying time of 45 minutes which is serviced by Royal Jordanian Airlines and Jordan Aviation Airlines. Several international airlines connect the city to Istanbul, Dubai, Alexandria, Sharm el-Sheikh, and other destinations in Asia and Europe. Since the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, there were plans to jointly develop airport infrastructure in the region. However, when Israel built Ramon Airport only 10 km distant from King Hussein International Airport, this happened without consulting the Jordanian side, which caused a slight deterioration of bilateral relations between the two countries and concerns over the safety of having two airports so close together.\n\nRoads\nAqaba is connected by an 8,000 kilometres (5,000 mi) modern highway system to surrounding countries. The city is connected to the rest of Jordan by the Desert Highway and the King's Highway that provides access to the resorts and settlements on the Dead Sea. Aqaba is connected to Eilat in Israel by taxi and bus services passing through the Wadi Araba crossing. And to Haql in Saudi Arabia by the Durra Border Crossing. There are many bus services between Aqaba and Amman and the other major cities in Jordan, JETT and Trust International are the most common lines. These tourist buses are spacious and installed with air conditioning and bathrooms.\n\nPort\nThe Port of Aqaba is the only port in Jordan. Regular ferry routes to Taba are available on a daily basis and are operated by several companies such as Sindbad for Marine Transportation and Arab Bridge Maritime. The routes serve mainly the Egyptian coastal cities on the gulf like Taba and Sharm Al Sheikh. In 2006, the port was ranked as being the \"Best Container Terminal\" in the Middle East by Lloyd's List. The port was chosen for its recent improvements and its ability to handle local traffic as well as international traffic to four neighboring countries.\n\nWildlife\nThe Gulf of Aqaba is rich with marine life. The gulf is home to approximately 500 fish species, with many being permanent residents, like lion fish and octopus, while others are migratory, typically appearing during the summer, such as sailfish, considered the fastest fish in the ocean, as well as the world's largest fish, the whale shark. Marine mammals and reptiles also inhabit the gulf during summer, hawksbill sea turtles, and bottle nosed dolphins call Aqaba's gulf home as well. A large number of predatory shark species used to inhabit Aqaba's gulf but, due to overfishing and pollution, this population is in decline.  While mostly deep water sharks such as the tiger sharks and thresher sharks are present, there are also a small number of reef sharks as well. The world's fastest shark, the short-fin mako shark is the most commonly caught species by fishermen in Aqaba. Whale sharks, locally known as Battan,  are the most commonly sighted. Conservationists are working hard to protect Aqaba's shark population.\nThe gulf of Aqaba hosts more than 390 bird species including migratory birds such as the greater flamingo, great white pelican and the pink-backed pelican.\n\nEducation\nThere is a University of Jordan Aqaba Branch.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nAqaba is twinned with:\n\nGallery\nSee also\nAqaba Special Economic Zone Authority\nDisi Water Conveyance Project\nMidian\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nAqaba Marketing and Tourism Directorate\nPhotos of Aqaba at the American Center of Research\nPhotos of Aqaba / Ayla at the American Center of Research\nAqaba - the Jewel of the Red Sea",

      "content": "العقبه هي المدينه الساحليه الوحيده في الاردن، والمدينه الاكبر والاكثر سكانا بين مدن خليج العقبه جميعها. تقع العقبه في اقصى جنوب المملكه الاردنيّه الهاشميّه على ساحل البحر الاحمر، وهي مركز محافظه العقبه. تبعد المدينه حوالي 330 كيلومتر جنوب العاصمه الاردنيه عمّان. وقد بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2015 حوالي 148,398 نسمه، حيث تُعد خامس اكبر مدينه في المملكه. وتبلغ مساحه المدينه 375 كيلومتر مربع (144.8 ميل2). وللعقبه دور كبير في الاقتصاد الوطني الاردني وتطويره؛ وذلك من خلال كل من القطاعين التجاري والسياحي. ويُذكر ان ميناء العقبه يعد معبرا بحريا مهما للدول الاخرى المجاوره للاردن كذلك.\nبسبب موقعها الاستراتيجي في اعلى شمال شرقي خليج العقبه المتفرع من البحر الاحمر، والذي يتوسط الطرق التجاريه بين قارتي اسيا وافريقيا؛ كل ذلك جعل من العقبه ومنفذها البحري منطقه مهمه عبر الاف السنين. بالاضافه لذلك، تتميز مدينه العقبه بانها منطقه استراتيجيه والمنفذ البحري الوحيد للاردن، كما انَّ للعقبه حدود بريه مع مدينه حقل في المملكه العربيه السعوديه عبر مركز حدود الدره، وحدود بحريه مع مصر وايضا مع مدينه ايلات عبر معبر وادي عربه وكلتا المدينتين تقعا على راس خليج العقبه المتفرع من البحر الاحمر. وتشتهر العقبه بكونها منطقه جاذبه لهواه الغوص بشواطئها المطله على البحر الاحمر. وتضم المدينه العديد من المنشات الصناعيه الهامه، والمناطق التجاريه الحره، ومطار الملك حسين الدولي. وتعتبر مركزا ادارياً مهماً في منطقه اقصى جنوب الاردن. ومصدر للفوسفات وبعض انواع الصدف. ويقدر عدد سكان المدينه بحوالي 150,000 نسمه.\nالاسم القديم للمدينه بحسب التوراه العبريه كان ايلات، وهو الاسم الذي استمر في الحقب اللاحقه الرومانيه وفي عهود الخلافه الاسلاميه على شكل ايله، ثم ايله. وبسبب موقعها موقعها الاستراتيجي وقربها من مناجم النحاس، فقد كانت مركزًا اقليميًا لانتاج النحاس وتجارته خلال العصر النحاسي. خلال الاحتلال البزنطي للمنطقه، اصبحت العقبه -ايله انذاك - ابرشيه نصرانيه، لتتحول بعد ذلك خلال الحكم العربي الاسلامي لابرشيه فخريه، وذلك عندما صار اسم المدينه ايله. اما اسم العقبه الحالي فهو ظهر في العهود المتاخره من القرون الوسطى. وخلال الثوره العربيه الكبرى، وقعت في العقبه معركه عرفت تاريخيا باسم معركه العقبه والتي كان لانتصار العرب فيها على الاتراك الاثر الحاسم في جلاء الاتراك عن البلاد العربيه.\nموقع مدينه العقبه بالقرب من وادي رم ومدينه البتراء احدى عجائب الدنيا السبع، جعل منها ومن المواقع المذكور ما يعرف بمثلث الاردن السياحي الذهبي؛ الشيء الذي قوّى من مكانتها السياحيه على الخريطه العالميه، كما جعلها واحده من كبريات الوجهات السياحيه الجاذبه في الاردن. تُدار العقبه اقتصاديا وخدماتيا من خلال سلطه منطقه العقبه الاقتصاديه الخاصه، والتي ساهمت بتحويل مدينه العقبه الى مدينه منخفضه الضرائب وخاليه من الرسوم الجمركيه، مما جعلها نقطه جاذبه لكبريات المشاريع مثل منتجعات ايله وسرايا العقبه ومرسى زايد  و هناك ايضاً رفاهيات مثل مهرجان العقبه و فعاليات رياضيه مثل سباقات القوارب وغيرها وايضاً  توسعه ميناء العقبه. كل تلك المشاريع من المتوقع منها ان تحول العقبه الى نقطه جذب سياحيه كبرى على مستوى الاقليم. ومع ذلك، تبقى للانشطه التجاريه والصناعيه اهميتها الكبيره؛ وذلك بسبب موقع العقبه وطبيعتها الاستراتيجيه، كونها هي المنفذ البحري الوحيد للاردن على العالم.\n\nالتسميه\nقبل اسم العقبه كان يطلق عليها اسم ايله وتعني في اللغه:\n\nاما اسم العقبه فبرز في العصر المملوكي، حيث كانت المدينه تذكر بايله او عقبه ايله ردحاً طويلاً من الزمن، حتى غلب اسم العقبه عليها في العصر المملوكي.\n\nتاريخ\nمنذ 4000 سنه قبل الميلاد كانت العقبه موطنا للعديد من الشعوب بسبب موقعها الاستراتيجي على البحر وعلى تقاطع الطرق بين اسيا وافريقيا واوروبا. كانت احد اهم مدن النبطيين الذين توسعوا في المنطقه واستوطنوها. وكانت معبراً لطرق التجاره الدوليه، تمر منها وتعود من خلالها القوافل القادمه من الحجاز وجنوب الجزيره العربيه متجهين الى مصر او بلاد الشام.\nاطلق اليونانيون عليها اسم بيرنايس واطلق عليها الرومان مسمى ايلا او الينا. خلال العهد الروماني كان طريق فيانوفاتريانا يتجه جنوباً من دمشق مارا بعمّان وينتهي في العقبه ومن هناك تتصل بالطريق المتجه غرباً الى فلسطين ومصر.\nبعد عهد النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم اصبحت العقبه تحت الحكم الاسلامي ثم تنقلت ملكيتها بين العديد من السلالات الحاكمه مثل الامويون والعباسيون والفاطميون والمماليك.\nخلال القرن الثاني عشر الميلادي قام الصليبيون باحتلال المنطقه وبنوا فيها قلعه لا تزال محفوظه الى الان. وبالاضافه الى بناء القلعه قاموا بتحصين جزيره تتبع الان المياه الاقليميه المصريه وتبعد 7 كم عن العقبه وتسمى جزيره فرعون.\nفي عام 1170م استعاد صلاح الدين الايوبي مدينه العقبه وجزيره فرعون. ثم استولى عليها المماليك في عام 1250م وبنوا فيها حصنا في القرن الرابع عشر في عهد اخر حكامهم وهو قانصوه الغوري.\nمع بدايه القرن السادس عشر خضعت المنطقه لنفوذ العثمانيين وفي فتره حكمهم بدات تفقد العقبه اهميتها فصارت قريه صغيره تعيش على صيد الاسماك.وتكون العقبه اجمل مدن الاردن\nخلال الحرب العالميه الاولى اجبرت القوات العثمانيه على مغادره القريه على يد القوات العربيه بقياده الشريف الحسين بن علي سنه 1917 ضاما العقبه لمملكته في الحجاز الامر الذي ادى الى فتح الابواب لخطوط الدعم القادمه من مصر الى القوات البريطانيه والعربيه في الاردن وفلسطين.\nفي عام 1965م تم الاتفاق بين الاردن والسعوديه على ان تاخذ السعوديه 6000 كم من الاراضي الصحراويه الداخليه الاردنيه مقابل 12 كم على الساحل في المنطقه القريبه من العقبه.\n\nالتركيبه السكانيه\nقامت دائره الاحصاء الاردنيه في عام 2007، باجراء عمليه تعداد لسكان في مدينه العقبه، بالمقارنه مع الاردن على الصعيد المحلي. وكانت النتائج على النحو الاتي:\n\nالسياحه في العقبه\nتعتبر السياحه في مدينه العقبه نشطه لاسباب متنوعه وانها منطقه ساحليه تقع على البحر الاحمر، كما ان فيها اماكن جميله يمكن زيارتها، فان العقبه منطقه مليئه بالسياح الذين ياتون للتمتع بالبحر الرائع والجو الجميل فيها.\nوتشتمل العقبه على اهم المشاريع المهتمه في السياحه البيئيه في الاردن وهي محطه العقبه لمراقبه الطيور والتي تستقطب عشرات الالف وربما الملايين من الطيور المهاجره اثناء رحلتها بين اوروبا وافريقيا خلال موسمي الهجره في الخريف والربيع، ويتضمن مشروع محطه العقبه لمراقبه الطيور غابه للاشجار الكبيره وحدائق لاشجار واطنه في المنطقه بالاضافه لمسطحات مائيه كبيره تلعب جميعها بشكل متكامل على استقطاب انواع مختلفه من الطيور قد يكون بعضها نادر الوجود على مستوى العالم الامر الذي يدفع العديد من المهتمين بمراقبه الطيور وعلماء الطيور لزياره المنطقه وعمل التحاليل العلميه والابحاث الخاصه بعلم الطيور.\nوتعد العقبه بشكل خاص ومنطقه الاردن بشكل عام من المناطق المهمه عالميا لهجره الطيور بناء على تصنيف Birdlife International.\n\nوتحتضن محطه العلوم البحريه الواقعه على الشاطئ الجنوبي لخليج العقبه معرضا للاحياء البحريه يستطيع الزائر ان يشاهد فيه الانواع المختلفه من المرجان والاسماك وغيرها من الكائنات الحيه المستوطنه في خليج العقبه. قامت هيئه تنشيط السياحه بعمل اعلانات وحملات دعائيه، بمساعده من الاتحاد الاوروبي.\nخلال فتره الاعياد الوطنيه ياتي الاردنيون من شمال المملكه، ولا سيما من عمان واربد، الى المنتجعات والشواطئ الرمليه، لقضاء عطله نهايه الاسبوع وخلال هذه الفتره تصل نسبه الاشغال في الفنادق الى 100%. في 2011 اختيرت العقبه عاصمه للسياحه العربيه.\nكما يوجد في مُحافظه العَقَبه وادي رم ذو الطّبيعه الرمليّه والجبليّه السّاحره. وفي جنوب العَقَبه اعلى ارتفاع في الاردن على الاطلاق مُتمثّلا بجبل ام الداميّ.\nتم افتتاح عام 2019 اول متحف عسكري مائي للغواصين في الاردن \nسيتم في عام 2020 الانتهاء من مشروع تطوير وتاهيل ساريه العلم الموجوده في ساحه الثوره العربيه الكبرى وستعتبر وجهه سياحيه تتضمن خمس متاحف واهم ما يميزها احتوائها على بيت الشريف حسين\n\nالاقتصاد\nاهتمت الاردن بالعقبه منذ التسعينات، لانها الميناء الاردني الوحيد. سعى الاردن لتطوير العقبه باكثر من صيغه، انتهت الى اعطاء منطقه العقبه وضعا خاصا، مثل الحوافز، والاعفاء من الضرائب، والرسوم، والاستقلال الاداري عن عمان، كما تم وضع الخطط لاجتذاب الاستثمار الاجنبي. اقتصاد العقبه نما بسرعه كبيره جدا بسبب انشاء منطقه العقبه الاقتصاديه الخاصه. وهناك تطور في العمران (الاسكان) وتشييد منتجعات جيده، ومشاريع جديده مثل خليج تالا بي وسرايا العقبه التي ستكون مكان لامضاء العطل والاجازات في منازل سكنيه متطوره للسياح والمواطنين على حد سواء. وتم استثمار اكثر من عشرين مليار دولار في العقبه منذ العام 2001 عندما تم تاسيس المنطقه الاقتصاديه الخاصه. وجذبت العقبه ايضا شركات لوجستيه عالميه مثل ايه بي ام تيرمينالز واجيليتي للاستثمار في مجال الخدمات اللوجستيه، مما عزز من وضع المدينه كمركز للنقل والخدمات اللوجستيه.\nتوجد العديد من الفنادق في العقبه ولكن هناك ايضا فنادق جديده قيد الانشاء. العقبه هي الميناء البحري الوحيد للاردن لذلك تقريبا اغلب صادرات الاردن تغادر من هذه المدينه. اكثر من 20 مليار دولار من الاستثمارات تتدفق الى العقبه من منطقه الخليج ومستثمريين اوروبيين، مما يجعل العقبه تتفوق على ايلات سياحيا واستثماريا، ايلات تلك المدينه المزدهره التي تقع على بعد بضع كيلومترات فقط.\nبحلول عام 2008 كانت منطقه العقبه الاقتصاديه الخاصه جذبت 18 مليار دولار من الاستثمارات، وبهذا تكون المدينه ضربت الرقم 6 مليارات دولار الذي طمحت ان تصل اليه بحلول عام 2020، بمقدار 300% واكثر من ذلك في اقل من عقد من الزمان. وقامت المدينه بتعديل هدفها الذي اصبح جلب 12 مليار دولار اخرى بحلول عام 2020، لكن في عام 2009 وحده وقّعت المدينه على صفقات بقيمه 14 مليار دولار. بعض المشاريع قيد الانشاء حاليا وهي على النحو الاتي:\n\nسرايا العقبه: 1.5 مليار دولار لبناء منتجع يضم بحيره صناعيه، فنادق فخمه، فلل، ومنازل فخمه على ان يكتمل المشروع بحلول عام 2017.\nمنتجع واحه ايلا بقيمه 2.1 مليار دولار وبحيره صناعيه المنتجع مع فنادق فخمه، فلل، ت وملعب للجولف ذي 18 حفره. ويحمل المنتجع طابعٌ يمثلُ بندقيهً عربيه، بطريقه تصميم المباني التي بنيت على طول قنوات مائيه لا يمكن الوصول اليها الا عن طريق قوارب او مسارات خاصه. الى جانب حديقه مائيه جزء من مشروع واحه ايلا' الذي سوف يكتمل بحلول عام 2017.\nخليج تالا بي عباره عن مجتمع منتقى ومتكامل، يقوم على مساحه مسيجه تبلغ 2.7 مليون متراً مربعا، يقع على الطرف الشمالي لخليج العقبه. وهذا المشروع اكتمل بقيمته 680 مليون دولار. كما يضم خليج تالا بي منتجعات وفنادق 4 او 5 مثل فندق الهيلتون.\nمرسى زايد، اكبر مشروع عقاري وسياحي على مستوى المنطقه، يمتد على مساحه 3.2 كم مربع ويشمل واجهه مائيه بطول 2 كم. ويهدف مشروع مرسى زايد الى تطوير الواجهه البحريه وتحويلها الى بيئه مؤهله للاستخدام المتعدد الاغراض تنتشر عليها الابراج السكنيه المرتفعه والمناطق المخصصه للمرافق الترفيهيه والسياحيه واخرى مخصصه للاعمال التجاريه والفنادق العالميه، على اكثر من ثلاثه ملايين متر مربع من الاراضي. ومن جهه اخرى، ستعد مراسي اليخوت المتعدده التي سيتم انشاؤها اضافه هامه للطاقه الاستيعابيه للمراسي القائمه حالياً في مدينه العقبه، مما يسهم في تحويل مدينه العقبه الى وجهه رئيسيه لليخوت، بالاضافه لانشاء ميناء حديث للبواخر السياحيه معد وفق افضل ما توصلت اليه التقنيات الحديثه في هذا المجال ليمثل بوابه للترحيب بزوار العقبه. سيتم تنفيذ هذا المشروع على عده مراحل على مدار 30 عاما، ومن المقرر ان يكتمل المشروع بحلول عام 2017.\nنقل الميناء سوف سيتم نقل ميناء العقبه الى الجزء الجنوبي من المحافظه بالقرب من الحدود السعوديه، بحلول عام 2016 حسب ما هو مقرر. وتطوير الميناء ليكون مرفا متطورا يضاهي المرافئ العالميه.\nسيتم ربط العقبه بمشروع شبكه السكك الوطنيه، الذي سيتم الانتهاء منه بحلول عام 2013. وسوف يربط مشروع السكك الحديديه في العقبه مع جميع المدن الرئيسيه في الاردن والمراكز الاقتصاديه والعديد من الدول مثل المملكه العربيه السعوديه والعراق وسوريا.\n\nمنطقه العقبه الاقتصاديه الخاصه\nاطلقت منطقه العقبه الاقتصاديه الخاصه (ASEZ) في عام 2001 بوصفها معفاه من الرسوم الجمركيه، منطقه تنمويه متعدده القطاعات بضرائب مخفضه تضم كامل منطقه الساحل الاردني (27 كم)، الموانئ البحريه الاردنيه، ومطار دولي ومدينه العقبه التاريخيه. تنظم منطقه العقبه الاقتصاديه الخاصه من قبل سلطه منطقه العقبه الاقتصاديه الخاصه وهي مكلفه باداره وتنظيم، وتقديم الخدمات البلديه داخل منطقه العقبه الاقتصاديه الخاصه. تعمل منطقه العقبه الاقتصاديه الخاصه بمبادره تنمويه مدفوعه من القطاع الخاص حيث تعمل على تعظيم مشاركه القطاع الخاص في السوق الحره والاستفاده من المزايا الضريبيه والبيئه التنظيميه المرنه. بالاضافه الى جعلها وجهه سياحيه فريده على البحر الاحمر، مع واحه تسوق معفاه من الرسوم الجمركيه يرافقه نوعيه حياه عاليه ومستوى معيشه.\n\nالمواصلات\nالنقل البري\nالعقبه متصله بالعاصمه عمان، المناطق المجاوره والدول الحدوديه بشبكه حديثه من الطرق السريعه، القادمين من عمان يمكن ان يسلكو طريق البحر الميت او سلوك الطريق الصحراوي الذي يعبر صحراء الديسي وصحراء وادي رم حيث قام لورانس العرب

      "summary": "العقبة هي المدينة الساحلية الوحيدة في الأردن، والمدينة الأكبر والأكثر سكانا بين مدن خليج العقبة جميعها. تقع العقبة في أقصى جنوب المملكة الأردنيّة الهاشميّة على ساحل البحر الأحمر، وهي مركز محافظة العقبة. تبعد المدينة حوالي 330 كيلومتر جنوب العاصمة الأردنية عمّان. وقد بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2015 حوالي 148,398 نسمة، حيث تُعد خامس أكبر مدينة في المملكة. وتبلغ مساحة المدينة 375 كيلومتر مربع (144.8 ميل2). وللعقبة دور كبير في الاقتصاد الوطني الأردني وتطويره؛ وذلك من خلال كل من القطاعين التجاري والسياحي. ويُذكر أن ميناء العقبة يعد معبرا بحريا مهما للدول الأخرى المجاورة للأردن كذلك.\nبسبب موقعها الاستراتيجي في أعلى شمال شرقي خليج العقبة المتفرع من البحر الأحمر، والذي يتوسط الطرق التجارية بين قارتي آسيا وإفريقيا؛ كل ذلك جعل من العقبة ومنفذها البحري منطقة مهمة عبر آلاف السنين. بالإضافة لذلك، تتميز مدينة العقبة بأنها منطقة إستراتيجية والمنفذ البحري الوحيد للأردن، كما أنَّ للعقبة حدود برية مع مدينة حقل في المملكة العربية السعودية عبر مركز حدود الدرة، وحدود بحرية مع مصر وأيضا مع مدينة إيلات عبر معبر وادي عربة وكلتا المدينتين تقعا على رأس خليج العقبة المتفرع من البحر الأحمر. وتشتهر العقبة بكونها منطقة جاذبة لهواة الغوص بشواطئها المطلة على البحر الأحمر. وتضم المدينة العديد من المنشآت الصناعية الهامة، والمناطق التجارية الحرة، ومطار الملك حسين الدولي. وتعتبر مركزا إدارياً مهماً في منطقة أقصى جنوب الأردن. ومصدر للفوسفات وبعض أنواع الصدف. ويقدر عدد سكان المدينة بحوالي 150,000 نسمة.\nالاسم القديم للمدينة بحسب التوراة العبرية كان إيلات، وهو الاسم الذي استمر في الحقب اللاحقة الرومانية وفي عهود الخلافة الإسلامية على شكل أيلة، ثم آيلة. وبسبب موقعها موقعها الاستراتيجي وقربها من مناجم النحاس، فقد كانت مركزًا إقليميًا لإنتاج النحاس وتجارته خلال العصر النحاسي. خلال الاحتلال البزنطي للمنطقة، أصبحت العقبة -أيلة آنذاك - أبرشية نصرانية، لتتحول بعد ذلك خلال الحكم العربي الإسلامي لأبرشية فخرية، وذلك عندما صار اسم المدينة آيلة. أما اسم العقبة الحالي فهو ظهر في العهود المتأخرة من القرون الوسطى. وخلال الثورة العربية الكبرى، وقعت في العقبة معركة عرفت تاريخيا باسم معركة العقبة والتي كان لانتصار العرب فيها على الأتراك الأثر الحاسم في جلاء الأتراك عن البلاد العربية.\nموقع مدينة العقبة بالقرب من وادي رم ومدينة البتراء إحدى عجائب الدنيا السبع، جعل منها ومن المواقع المذكور ما يعرف بمثلث الأردن السياحي الذهبي؛ الشيء الذي قوّى من مكانتها السياحية على الخريطة العالمية، كما جعلها واحدة من كبريات الوجهات السياحية الجاذبة في الأردن. تُدار العقبة اقتصاديا وخدماتيا من خلال سلطة منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة، والتي ساهمت بتحويل مدينة العقبة إلى مدينة منخفضة الضرائب وخالية من الرسوم الجمركية، مما جعلها نقطة جاذبة لكبريات المشاريع مثل منتجعات آيلة وسرايا العقبة ومرسى زايد  و هناك ايضاً رفاهيات مثل مهرجان العقبة و فعاليات رياضية مثل سباقات القوارب وغيرها وايضاً  توسعة ميناء العقبة. كل تلك المشاريع من المتوقع منها أن تحول العقبة إلى نقطة جذب سياحية كبرى على مستوى الإقليم. ومع ذلك، تبقى للأنشطة التجارية والصناعية أهميتها الكبيرة؛ وذلك بسبب موقع العقبة وطبيعتها الاستراتيجية، كونها هي المنفذ البحري الوحيد للأردن على العالم.",
