      "content": "Amman is the capital and the largest city of Jordan, and the country's economic, political, and cultural center. With a population of five million as of 2024, Amman is Jordan's primate city and is the largest city in the Levant region, the fifth-largest city in the Arab world, and the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East.\nAmman is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman dates to the 8th millennium BC in 'Ain Ghazal, home to the world's oldest statues of the human form. During the Iron Age, the city was known as Rabat Aman, the capital of the Ammonite Kingdom. In the 3rd century BC, the city was renamed Philadelphia and became one of the ten Greco-Roman cities of the Decapolis. Later, in the 7th century AD, the Rashidun Caliphate renamed the city Amman. Throughout most of the Islamic era, the city alternated between periods of devastation and periods of relative prosperity. Amman was largely abandoned during the Ottoman period from the 15th century until 1878, when it was resettled by Circassians. The city grew after it was connected to the Hejaz Railway in 1904, leading to the formation of its first municipal council in 1909.\nAmman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan's capital in 1921, receiving migrations from different Jordanian and Levantine cities, and later several successive waves of refugees: Palestinians in 1948 and 1967; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003; and Syrians since 2011. It was initially built on seven hills, but now spans over 19 hills combining 22 areas, which are administered by the Greater Amman Municipality. Areas of Amman have gained their names from either the hills (jabal) or the valleys (wadi) they occupy, such as Jabal al-Luweibdeh and Wadi Abdoun. East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities, while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city.\nApproximately one million visitors arrived in Amman in 2018, which made it the 89th most-visited city in the world and the 12th most-visited Arab city. Amman has a relatively fast growing economy and it is ranked as a Beta− global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Moreover, it was named one of the Middle East and North Africa's best cities according to economic, labor, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. The city is among the most popular locations in the Arab world for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices, alongside Doha and only behind Dubai. Amman has a bus network, including a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system that serves the city and connects it to neighboring Zarqa.\n\nEtymology\nAmman derives its name from the ancient people of the Ammonites, whose capital the city had been since the 13th century BC. The Ammonites named it Rabat ʿAmmān (𐤓𐤁𐤕 𐤏𐤌𐤍), with the term Rabat meaning the \"Capital\" or the \"King's Quarters\". In the Hebrew Bible, the town is referred to as Rabbaṯ Bənē ʿAmmōn (רַבַּת בְּנֵי עַמּוֹן) or simply Rabbā (רַבָּה), and it appears in English translations as \"Rabbah of the Ammonites,\" \"Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, or \"Rabbath Ammon.\" Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the Macedonian ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom who reigned from 283 to 246 BC, renamed the city Philadelphia (Ancient Greek: Φιλαδέλφεια; literally: \"brotherly love\"), after himself, after occupying it. By the Islamic era, the Rashidun Caliphate restored its ancient Semitic name and called it Amman in the 7th century AD.\n\nHistory\nNeolithic period\nThe Neolithic site of ʿAin Ghazal today lies in the outskirts of Amman. At its height, around 7000 BC (9000 years ago), it had an area of 15 hectares (37 acres) and was inhabited by ca. 3000 people (four to five times the population of contemporary Jericho). At that time, the site was a typical aceramic Neolithic village. Its houses were rectangular mud-bricked buildings that included a main square living room, whose walls were made up of lime plaster. The site was discovered in 1974 as construction workers were working on a road crossing the area. By 1982, when the excavations started, around 600 meters (2,000 feet) of road ran through the site. Despite the damage brought by urban expansion, the remains of ʿAin Ghazal provided a wealth of information.\nʿAin Ghazal is well known for a set of small human statues found in 1983, when local archeologists stumbled upon the edge of a large pit containing them. These statues are human figures made with white plaster, with painted eyes. Thirty-two figures were found in two caches, fifteen of them full figures, fifteen busts, and two fragmentary heads. Three of the busts depicted two-headed characters, the significance of which is not clear.\n\nIron Age: the Ammonites\nIn the 13th century BC, Amman was the capital of the Ammonite Kingdom, and became known as \"Rabat Amman\". Rabat Amman provided several natural resources to the region, including sandstone and limestone, along with a productive agricultural sector that made it a vital location along the King's Highway, the ancient trade route connecting Egypt with Mesopotamia, Syria and Anatolia. As with the Edomites and Moabites, trade along this route gave the Ammonites considerable revenue. Milcom is named in the Hebrew Bible as the national god of Rabat Amman. Another ancient deity, Moloch, usually associated with the use of children as offerings, is also mentioned in the Bible as a god of the Ammonites, but this is probably a mistake for Milcom. However, excavations by archeologists near Amman Civil Airport uncovered a temple, which included an altar containing many human bone fragments. The bones showed evidence of burning, which led to the assumption that the altar functioned as a pyre and used for human sacrifice.\nAmman is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible. According to the biblical narrative, the Ammonite king Hanun allied with Hadadezer, king of Aram-Zobah, against the United Kingdom of Israel. During the war, Joab, the captain of King David's army, laid siege to Rabbah, Hanun's royal capital, and destroyed it (2 Samuel 12:26–28, 1 Chronicles 20:1–2). David took a great quantity of plunder from the city, including the king's crown, and brought it to his capital, Jerusalem (2 Samuel 12:29–31). Hanun's brother, Shobi, was made king in his place, and became a loyal vassal of David (2 Samuel 17:27). Hundreds of years later, the prophet Jeremiah foresaw the coming destruction and final desolation of the city (Jeremiah 49:2).\nSeveral Ammonite ruins across Amman exist, such as Rujm Al-Malfouf and some parts of the Amman Citadel. The ruins of Rujm Al-Malfouf consist of a stone watchtower used to ensure the protection of their capital and several store rooms to the east. The city was later conquered by the Assyrians, followed by the Babylonians and the Achaemenid Persians.\n\nClassical and late antiquity\nHellenistic period\nConquest of the Near East by Alexander the Great firmly consolidated the influence of Hellenistic culture, marking the start of the Hellenistic period. Little is known about Greek/Macedonian control over the Levantine coast and Transjordan until 301 BCE, 22 years after Alexander's death, when the Ptolemies took control over this area. The Greeks founded new cities in the area of modern-day Jordan, including Gadara (Umm Qays), Gerasa (Jerash), Pella (Tabaqat Fahl) and Philadelphia (Amman). Ptolemy II nicknamed Philadelphus, the Macedonian ruler of Egypt, established in or before 259/58 BCE at the site of Amman what was initially probably a military colony, which then developed into a full-blown Greek-type polis, possibly by settling there Hellenised Tyrean colonists. Ptolemy II named it Philadelphia (Ancient Greek: Φιλαδέλφεια, romanized: Philadelpheia), evoking \"brotherly love\" in Greek, in adulation to his own nickname.\nWritten sources speak of members of the Jewish Tobiad family based in Jerusalem, who worked for the Ptolemies as tax collectors in charge of the entire region. The last known Tobiad, Hyrcanus, built the unique Hellenistic palace of Tyros (today's Qasr al-Abd, 'Castle of the Slave') southwest of Philadelpheia, before killing himself in c. 170-168 BC as the Seleucid king Antiochus IV seemed poised to attack him. This was one of several episodes in the Syrian Wars between the Seleucids and the Ptolemies, ending with the 200 BCE victory of the Seleucids at the Battle of Panium. In 218/17 BCE for instance, Seleucid king Antiochus III destroyed the Ptolemaic garrisons in the centre of Transjordan, capturing Philadelpheia in the process. Even after 200 BCE, Philadelpheia seems to have broken free at times from Seleucid rule and probably also escaped capture by Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaios (r. c. 103 – c. 76 BCE), who was more successful elsewhere in the region. Other Hasmonean and Nabataean rulers acted as regional power brokers, contributing to the instability of the political situation during the 2nd century BCE and until the advent of the Roman period in the following century, which led to the Hellenisation of the region only truly setting in under the Romans.\n\nRoman period\nThe Romans conquered much of the Levant in 63 BC, inaugurating a period of imperial rule conducted from Rome that lasted for four centuries. In the northern parts of modern-day Jordan, the Greek cities of Philadelphia (Amman), Gerasa, Gedara, Pella and Arbila joined with other cities in Palestine and southern parts of today's Syria to form the Decapolis League, a confederation based on common economic and cultural interests (see also Scythopolis, Hippos, Capitolias, Canatha and Damascus). Philadelphia became a point along a road stretching from Ailah to Damascus that was built by Emperor Trajan in AD 106. This provided an economic boost for the city in a short period of time.\nThere are traces of Roman construction all across Jordan. In Amman the most conspicuous structures include the Great Temple (inaccurately known as the \"Temple of Hercules\") at the Amman Citadel, the Roman Theatre, the Odeon, and the Nymphaeum. The two theaters and the nymphaeum fountain were built during the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius around AD 161. The theatre was the larger venue of the two and had a capacity for 6,000 attendees. It was oriented north and built into the hillside, to protect the audience from the sun. To the northeast of the theatre was a small odeon. Built at roughly the same time as the theatre, the Odeon had 500 seats and is still in use today for music concerts. Archaeologists speculate that the structure was originally covered with a wooden roof to shield the audience from the weather. The Nymphaeum is situated southwest of the Odeon and served as Philadelphia's chief fountain. The Nymphaeum is believed to have contained a 600 square meters (6,500 sq ft) pool which was 3 meters (9.8 ft) deep and was continuously refilled with water.\n\nByzantine period\nDuring the late Byzantine period in the seventh century, several bishops were based in the city; a number of church sites from the Byzantine period have been discovered there - see List of Byzantine churches in Amman.\n\nEarly Muslim period (7th–11th century)\nIn the 630s, the Rashidun Caliphate conquered the region from the Byzantines, beginning the Islamic era in the Levant. Philadelphia was renamed \"Amman\" by the Muslims and became part of the district of Jund Dimashq. A large part of the population already spoke Arabic, which facilitated integration into the caliphate, as well as several conversions to Islam. Under the Umayyad caliphs who began their rule in 661 AD, numerous desert castles were established as a means to govern the desert area of modern-day Jordan, several of which are still well-preserved. Amman had already been functioning as an administrative centre. The Umayyads built a large palace on the Amman Citadel hill, known today as the Umayyad Palace. Amman was later destroyed by several earthquakes and natural disasters, including a particularly severe earthquake in 749. The Umayyads were overthrown by the Abbasids three years later.\nAmman's importance declined by the mid-8th century after damage caused by several earthquakes rendered it uninhabitable. Excavations among the collapsed layer of the Umayyad Palace have revealed remains of kilns from the time of the Abbasids (750–969) and the Fatimids (969–1099). In the late 9th century, Amman was noted as the \"capital\" of the Balqa by geographer al-Yaqubi. Likewise, in 985, the Jerusalemite historian al-Muqaddasi described Amman as the capital of Balqa, that it was a town in the desert fringe of Syria surrounded by villages and cornfields and a regional source of lambs, grain and honey. Its inhabitants he reports, at the time, were Shia Muslims. Furthermore, al-Muqaddasi describes Amman as a \"harbor of the desert\" where Arab Bedouin would take refuge, and that its citadel, which overlooked the town, contained a small mosque.\n\nCrusaders and Ayyubids (12th–13th century)\nThe occupation of the Citadel Hill by the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem is so far based only on interpretations of Crusader sources. William of Tyre writes in his Historia that in 1161 Philip of Milly received the castle of Ahamant, which is seen to refer to Amman, as part of the lordship of Oultrejordain. In 1166 Philip joined the military order of the Knights Templar, passing on to them a significant part of his fief including the castle of Ahamant or \"Haman\", as it is named in the deed of confirmation issued by King Amalric. By 1170, Amman was in Ayyubid hands. The remains of a watch tower on Citadel Hill, first attributed to the Crusaders, now are preferentially dated to the Ayyubid period, leaving it to further research to find the location of the Crusader castle. During the Ayyubid period, the Damascene geographer al-Dimashqi wrote that Amman was part of the province of al-Karak, although \"only ruins\" remained of the town.\n\nMamluk period (13th–early 16th century)\nDuring the Mamluk era (late 13th–early 16th century), the region of Amman was a part of Wilayat Balqa, the southernmost district of Mamlakat Dimashq (Damascus Province). The capital of the district in the first half of the 14th century was the minor administrative post of Hisban, which had a considerably smaller garrison than the other administrative centers in Transjordan, namely Ajlun and al-Karak.  In 1321, the geographer Abu'l Fida, recorded that Amman was \"a very ancient town\" with fertile soil and surrounded by agricultural fields. For unclear, though likely financial reasons, in 1356, the capital of Balqa was transferred from Hisban to Amman, which was considered a madina (city). In 1357, Emir Sirghitmish bought Amman in its entirety, most likely to use revenues from the city to help fund the Madrasa of Sirghitmish, which he built in Cairo that same year. After his purchase of the city, Sirghitmish transferred the courts, administrative bureaucracy, markets and most of the inhabitants of Hisban to Amman. Moreover, he financed new building works in the city.\nOwnership of Amman following Sirghitmish's death in 1358 passed to successive generations of his descendants until 1395, when his descendants sold it to Emir Baydamur al-Khwarazmi, the na'ib as-saltana (viceroy) of Damascus. Afterward, part of Amman's cultivable lands were sold to Emir Sudun al-Shaykhuni (died 1396), the na'ib as-saltana of Egypt. The increasingly frequent division and sale of the city and lands of Amman to different owners signalled declining revenues coming from Amman, while at the same time, Hisban was restored as the major city of the Balqa in the 15th century. From then until 1878, Amman was an abandoned site periodically used to shelter seasonal farmers who cultivated arable lands in its vicinity and by Bedouin tribes who used its pastures and water. The Ottoman Empire annexed the region of Amman in 1516, but for much of the Ottoman period, al-Salt functioned as the virtual political center of Transjordan.\n\nModern era (1878–present)\nLate Ottoman period (1878–1917)\nAmman began to be resettled in 1878, when several hundred Muslim Circassians arrived following their expulsion from the North Caucasus by the Russian Empire during the events of the Russo-Circassian War. Between 1878 and 1910, tens of thousands of Circassians became refugees in the Ottoman Empire, which had moved large numbers of them into its province of Syria. The Ottoman authorities directed the Circassians, who were mainly of peasant stock, to settle in Amman, and distributed arable land among them. Their settlement was a partial manifestation of the Ottoman statesman Kamil Pasha's project, which did not materialize, to establish the Amman Province (vilayet) which, along with other sites in its vicinity, would become Circassian-populated townships guaranteeing the security of the Damascus–Medina highway. The first Circassian settlers, who belonged to the Shapsug tribe, lived near Amman's Roman theater and incorporated its stones into the houses they built. The English traveller Laurence Oliphant noted in his 1879 visit that most of the original Circassian settlers had left Amman by then, with about 150 remaining. They were joined by Circassians from the Kabardian and Abzakh tribes in 1880–1892.\n\nUntil 1900 settlement was concentrated in the valley and slopes of the Amman stream and settlers built mud-brick houses with wooden roofs. The French Dominican priest Marie-Joseph Lagrange commented in 1890 about Amman: \"A mosque, the ancient bridges, all that jumbled with the houses of the Circassians gives Amman a remarkable physiognomy\". The new village became a nahiye (subdistrict) center of the kaza of al-Salt in the Karak Sanjak established in 1894. By 1908 Amman contained 800 houses divided between three main quarters, Shapsug, Kabartai and Abzakh, each called after the Circassian groupings which respectively settled there, a number of mosques, open-air markets, shops, bakeries, mills, a textile factory, a post and telegraph office and a government compound (saraya). Kurdish settlers formed their own quarter called \"al-Akrad\" after them, while a number of townspeople from nearby al-Salt and al-Fuheis, seeking to avoid high taxes and conscription or attracted by financial incentives, and traders from Najd and Morocco, had also moved to the town.\n\nThe city's demographics changed dramatically after the Ottoman government's decision to construct the Hejaz Railway, which linked Damascus and Medina, and facilitated the annual Hajj pilgrimage and trade. Operational in central Transjordan since 1903, the Hejaz Railway helped to transform Amman from a small village into a major commercial hub in the region. Circassian entrepreneurship, facilitated by the railway, helped to attract investment from merchants from Damascus, Nablus, and Jerusalem, many of whom moved to Amman in the 1900s and 1910s. Some of the Arab families who arrived from surrounding regions during this period include Hudhud, Malas, Idlibi, Bdeir, Haddad, and Kawar. Although they settled after the local Circassian population and Bedouins of Jordan, they earned the nickname 'Founding Families of Amman' for establishing key institutions such as pharmacies and construction firms, and for bringing goods and expertise from their more developed cities of origion. Amman's first municipal council was established in 1909, and Circassian Ismael Babouk was elected as its mayor.\n\nFirst World War\nThe First and Second Battle of Amman were part of the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I and the Arab Revolt, taking place in 1918. Amman had a strategic location along the Hejaz Railway; its capture by British forces and the Hashemite Arab army facilitated the British advance towards Damascus. The second battle was won by the British, resulting in the establishment of the British Mandate.\n\nBritish Mandate; Emirate of Transjordan (1921–1946)\nIn 1921, the Hashemite emir and later king Abdullah I designated Amman instead of al-Salt to be the capital of the newly created state, the Emirate of Transjordan, which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1950. Its function as the capital of the country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the Jordan River at the time. The early settlers who came from Palestine were overwhelmingly from Nablus, from which many of al-Salt's inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus. Amman later attracted people from the southern part of the country, particularly al-Karak and Madaba. The city's population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.\nThe British report from 1933 shows around 1,700 Circassians living in Amman. Yet the community was far from insulated. Local urban and nomadic communities formed alliances with the Circassians, some of which are still present today. This cemented the status of Circassians in the re-established city.\n\nPost-independence (1946–present)\nJordan gained its independence in 1946 and Amman was designated the country's capital. Amman received many refugees during wartime events in nearby countries, beginning with the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. A second wave arrived after the Six-Day War in 1967. In 1970, Amman was a battlefield during the conflict between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Jordanian Army known as Black September. The Jordanian Army defeated the PLO in 1971, and the latter were expelled to Lebanon. The first wave of Iraqi refugees settled in the city after the 1991 Gulf War, with a second wave occurring in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nOn 9 November 2005, Al-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's leadership launched coordinated explosions in three hotel lobbies in Amman, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. Jordan's security as a whole was dramatically improved after the attack, and no major terrorist attacks have been reported since then. Most recently a wave of Syrian refugees have arrived in the city during the ongoing Syrian Civil War which began in 2011. Amman was a principal destination for refugees for the security and prosperity it offered.\nDuring the 2010s, the city has experienced an economic, cultural and urban boom. The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation, and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace. This strained Jordan's scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers of quick expansion without careful municipal planning.\n\nGeography\nAmman is situated on the East Bank Plateau, an upland characterized by three major wadis which run through it. Originally, the city had been built on seven hills. Amman's terrain is typified by its mountains. The most important areas in the city are named after the hills or mountains they lie on. The area's elevation ranges from 700 to 1,100 m (2,300 to 3,600 ft). Al-Salt and al-Zarqa are located to the northwest and northeast, respectively, Madaba is located to the west, and al-Karak and Ma'an are to Amman's southwest and southeast, respectively. One of the only remaining springs in Amman now supplies the Zarqa River with water. Trees found in Amman include Aleppo pine, Mediterranean cypress and Phoenician juniper.\n\nClimate\nAmman features a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa) in its western and northern neighborhoods, while its eastern and southern neighborhoods experience a semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh/BSk).\nThe summer season in Amman is moderately long, characterized by mild heat and refreshing breezes. However, occasional heatwaves may occur during this period. Spring is brief yet warm, with temperatures reaching highs of 28 °C (82 °F). This season typically commences between April and May, lasting for about a month. Winter usually sets in around the end of November, extending through early to mid-March. During winter, temperatures typically hover around or below 17 °C (63 °F), with sporadic snowfall occurring once or twice a year.\nThe average annual rainfall in Amman is around 385 mm (15 in), with great variations between different parts of the city. The western areas receive more than 500 mm (20 in) of rainfall, whereas the eastern areas receive less than 250 mm (10 in). Rainfall primarily occurs between November and April, and periodic droughts are not uncommon.\nAmman experiences heavy fog on about 120 days each year. The city's diverse weather conditions are heavily influenced by differences in elevation. While snow might accumulate in the higher-altitude western and northern regions of Amman (with an average altitude of 1,000 m or 3,300 ft above sea level), the city center (at an elevation of 700 m or 2,300 ft) might experience rainfall simultaneously. This variation in elevation leads to extreme microclimates within Amman, with each district having its own distinct weather patterns.\n\nLocal government\nAmman is governed by a 41-member city council elected directly for terms of four years. All Jordanian citizens above 18 years old are eligible to vote in the municipal elections. However, the mayor is appointed by the king and not through elections. In 1909 a city council was established in Amman by Circassian Ismael Babouk who became the first-ever mayor of the capital, and in 1914 Amman's first city district center was founded.\nThe Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) has been investing in making the city a better place, through a number of initiatives. Green Amman 2020 was initiated in 2014, aiming to turn the city to a green metropolis by 2020. According to official statistics, only 2.5% of Amman is green space. In 2015 GAM and Zain Jordan started operating free-of-charge Wi-Fi services at 15 locations, including Wakalat Street, Rainbow Street, The Hashemite Plaza, Ashrafieh Cultural Complex, Zaha Cultural Center, Al Hussein Cultural Center, Al Hussein Public Parks and others.\n\nAdministrative divisions\nJordan is divided into twelve administrative divisions, each called a governorate. Amman Governorate divides into nine districts, five of which are divided into sub-districts. The Greater Amman Municipality has 22 areas which are further divided into neighborhoods.\nThe city is administered as the Greater Amman Municipality and covers 22 areas which include:\n\nEconomy\nBanking sector\nThe banking sector is one of the principal foundations of Jordan's economy. Despite the unrest and economic difficulties in the Arab world resulting from the Arab Spring uprisings, Jordan's banking sector maintained its growth in 2014. The sector consists of 25 banks, 15 of which are listed on the Amman Stock Exchange. Amman is the base city for the international Arab Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East, serving clients in more than 600 branches in 30 countries on five continents. Arab Bank represents 28% of the Amman Stock Exchange and is the highest-ranked institution by market capitalization on the exchange.\n\nTourism\nAmman is the fourth most-visited Arab city and the ninth highest recipient of international visitor spending. Roughly 1.8 million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3 billion in the city. The expansion of Queen Alia International Airport is an example of the Greater Amman Municipality's heavy investment in the city's infrastructure. The recent construction of a public transportation system and a national railway, and the expansion of roads, are intended to ease the traffic generated by the millions of annual visitors to the city.\nAmman, and Jordan in general, is the Middle East's hub for medical tourism. Jordan receives the most medical tourists in the region and the fifth highest in the world. Amman receives 250,000 foreign patients a year and over $1 billion annually.\n\nBusiness\nAmman is introducing itself as a business hub. The city's skyline is being continuously transformed through the emergence of new projects. A significant portion of business flowed into Amman following the 2003 Iraq War. Jordan's main airport, Queen Alia International Airport, is located south of Amman and is the hub for the country's national carrier Royal Jordanian, a major airline in the region. The airline is headquartered in Zahran district. Rubicon Group Holding and Maktoob, two major regional information technology companies, are based in Amman, along with major international corporations such as Hikma Pharmaceuticals, one of the Middle East's largest pharmaceutical companies, and Aramex, the Middle East's largest logistics and transportation company.\nIn a report by Dunia Frontier Consultants, Amman, along with Doha, Qatar and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, are the favored hubs for multinational corporations operating in the Middle East and North Africa region. In FDI magazine, Amman was chosen as the Middle Eastern city with the most potential to be a leader in foreign direct investment in the region. Furthermore, several of the world's largest investment banks have offices in Amman including Standard Chartered, Société Générale, and Citibank.\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Amman reached 4,007,526 in 2015; the city contains about 42% of Jordan's entire population. It has a land area of 1,680 km2 (648.7 sq mi) which yields a population density of about 2,380 inhabitants per square kilometer (6,200/sq mi). The population of Amman has risen exponentially with the successive waves of immigrants and refugees arriving throughout the 20th century. From a population of roughly 1,000 in 1890, Amman grew to around 1,000,000 inhabitants in 1990, primarily as a result of immigration, but also due to the high birthrate in the city. Amman had been abandoned for centuries until hundreds of Circassians settled it in the 19th century. Today, about 40,000 Circassians live in Amman and its vicinity. After Amman became a major hub along the Hejaz Railway in 1914, many Muslim and Christian merchant families from al-Salt immigrated to the city. A large proportion of Amman's inhabitants have Palestinian roots (urban or rural origin), and the two main demographic groups in the city today are Arabs of Palestinian or Jordanian descent. Other ethnic groups comprise about 2% of the population. There are no official statistics about the proportion of people of Palestinian or Jordanian descent.\nNew arrivals consisting of Jordanians from the north and south of the country and immigrants from Palestine had increased the city's population from 30,000 in 1930 to 60,000 in 1947. About 10,000 Palestinians, mostly from Safed, Haifa and Acre, migrated to the city for economic opportunities before the 1948 war. Many of the immigrants from al-Salt from that time were originally from Nablus. The 1948 war caused an exodus of urban Muslim and Christian Palestinian refugees, mostly from Jaffa, Ramla and Lydda, to Amman, whose population swelled to 110,000. With Jordan's capture of the West Bank during the war, many Palestinians from that area steadily migrated to Amman between 1950 and 1966, before another mass wave of Palestinian refugees from the West Bank moved to the city during the 1967 War. By 1970, the population had swelled to an estimated 550,000. A further 200,000 Palestinians arrived after their expulsion from Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War. Several large Palestinian refugee camps exist around the center of Amman.\nBecause Amman lacks a deep-rooted native population, the city does not have a distinct Arabic dialect, although recently such a dialect utilizing the various Jordanian and Palestinian dialects, has been forming. The children of immigrants in the city are also increasingly referring to themselves as \"Ammani\", unlike much of the first-generation inhabitants who identify more with their respective places of origin.\n\nReligion\nAmman has a mostly Sunni Muslim population, and the city contains numerous mosques. Among the main mosques is the large King Abdullah I Mosque, built between 1982 and 1989. It is capped by a blue mosaic dome beneath which 3,000 Muslims may offer prayer. The Abu Darweesh Mosque, noted for its checkered black-and-white pattern, has an architectural style that is unique to Jordan. The mosque is situated on Jabal Ashrafieh, the highest point in the city. The mosque's interior is marked by light-colored walls and Persian carpets. During the 2004 Amman Message conference, edicts from various clergy-members afforded the following schools of thought as garnering collective recognition: Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi'i, Ja'fari, Zahiri, Zaydi, Ibadi, tassawuf-related Sufism, Muwahhidism and Salafism. Amman also has a small Druze community.\nLarge numbers of Christians from throughout Jordan, particularly from al-Salt, have moved to Amman. Nearby Fuheis is a predominantly Christian town located to the northwest of the city. A small Armenian Catholic community of around 70 families is present in the city. Ecclesiastical courts for matters of personal status are also located in Amman. A total of 16 historic churches are located in Umm ar-Rasas ruins in Al-Jeezah district; the site is believed to have initially served as Roman fortified military camps which gradually became a town around the 5th century AD. It has not been completely excavated. It was influenced by several civilizations including the Romans, Byzantines and Muslims. The site contains some well-preserved mosaic floors, particularly the mosaic floor of the Church of Saint Stephen.\n\nCityscape\nDowntown Amman, the city center area (known in Arabic as Al-Balad), has been dwarfed by the sprawling urban area that surrounds it. Despite the changes, much remains of its old character. Jabal Amman is a tourist attraction in old Amman, where the city's largest souks, museums, ancient constructions, monuments, and cultural sites are found. Jabal Amman also contains the famous Rainbow Street and the cultural Souk Jara market.\n\nArchitecture\nResidential buildings are limited to four stories above street level and if possible another four stories below, according to the Greater Amman Municipality regulations. The buildings are covered with thick white or beige limestone or sandstone. The buildings usually have balconies on each floor, with the exception of the ground floor, which has a front and back yard. Some buildings make use of Mangalore tiles on the roofs or on the roof of covered porches. Hotels, towers and commercial buildings are either covered by stone, plastic or glass.\n\nHigh-rise construction and towers\nZahran district in west Amman is the location of the Jordan Gate, which is a high class commercial and residential project currently under construction in the Wadi Al-Seer district of Amman, Jordan, it consists of two high-rise buildings connected by a multi-storey podium.\nNew Abdali district hosts a mall, a boulevard along with several hotels, commercial and residential towers. Valued at more than US$5 billion with two main phases, the district created a new visible center for Amman and act as the major business district for the city.\nThe first phase, estimated at more than JD2.4 billion, and receiving about 20 million visitors annually, contains seven Itowers extending over an area of 1.03 million square metres. It attracts about 500 companies operating in 27 sectors, and provided a total of 15,000 job opportunities by 2023.\nA second phase was announced in May 2024, which will cover an area of 1.2 million square meters and is anticipated to create over 3,000 job opportunities each year, were outlined in the statement. This phase involves the construction of a multi-use conference center with a capacity for 25,000 people, as well as two towers that will include hotels, residential apartments, commercial centers, and advanced medical facilities.\n\nCulture\nMuseums\nThe largest museum in Jordan is The Jordan Museum. It contains much of the valuable archeological findings in the country, including some of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Neolithic limestone statues of 'Ain Ghazal, and a copy of the Mesha Stele. Other museums include the Duke's Diwan, Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts, Jordan Archaeological Museum, The Children's Museum Jordan, The Martyrs' Memorial and Museum, the Royal Automobile Museum, the Prophet Mohammad Museum, the Museum of Parliamentary Life, the Jordan Folklore Museum, and museums at the University of Jordan.\n\nLifestyle\nAmman is considered one of the most liberal cities in the Arab world. The city has become one of the most popular destinations for expatriates and college students who seek to live, study, or work in the Middle East or the Arab world in general. The city's culinary scene has changed from its shawarma stands and falafel joints to embrace many popular international restaurants and fast-food outlets such as Asian fusion restaurants, French bistros and Italian trattorias. The city has become famous for its fine dining scene among Western expatriates and Persian Gulf tourists.\n\nLarge shopping malls were built during the 2000s in Amman, including the Mecca Mall, Abdoun Mall, City Mall, Al-Baraka Mall, TAJ Lifestyle Center, Zara Shopping Center, Avenue Mall, and Abdali Mall in Al Abdali. Wakalat Street (\"Agencies Street\") is Amman's first pedestrian-only street and carries a lot of name-label clothes. The Sweifieh area is considered to be the main shopping district of Amman.\nNightclubs, music bars and shisha lounges are present across Amman, changing the city's old image as the conservative capital of the kingdom. This burgeoning new nightlife scene is shaped by Jordan's young population. In addition to the wide range of drinking and dancing venues on the social circuit of the city's affluent crowd, Amman hosts cultural entertainment events, including the annual Amman Summer Festival. Souk Jara is a Jordanian weekly flea market event that occurs every Friday throughout the summer. Sweifieh is considered to be the unofficial red-light district of Amman as it holds most of the city's nightclubs, bars. Jabal Amman and Jabal al-Luweibdeh are home to many pubs and bars as well, making the area popular among bar hoppers.\nAlcohol is widely available in restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and supermarkets. There are numerous nightclubs and bars across the city, especially in West Amman. As of 2011, there were 77 registered nightclubs in Jordan (excluding bars and pubs), overwhelmingly located in the capital city. In 2009, there were 222 registered liquor stores in Amman.\n\nCuisine\nDanielle Pergament of The New York Times described Ammani cuisine as a product of several cuisines in the region, writing that it combines \"the bright vegetables from Lebanon, crunchy falafels from Syria, juicy kebabs from Egypt and, most recently, spicy meat dishes from Jordan's neighbor, Iraq. It's known as the food of the Levant – an ancient word for the area bounded by the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian peninsula. But the food here isn't just the sum of its calories. In this politically, religiously and ethnically fraught corner of the world, it is a symbol of bloodlines and identity.\" However, the city's street food scene makes the Ammani cuisine distinctive.\n\nSports\nAmman-based football clubs Al-Wehdat and Al-Faisaly, both former league champions, share one of the most popular rivalries in the local football scene. Amman hosted the 2016 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup along with Irbid and Zarqa.\nThe 2007 Asian Athletics Championships and more than one edition of the IAAF World Cross Country Championships were held in the city. Amman also hosts the Jordan Rally, which form part of the FIA World Rally Championship, becoming one of the largest sporting events ever held in Jordan.\nAmman is home to a growing number of foreign sports such as skateboarding and rugby; the latter has two teams based in the city: Amman Citadel Rugby Club and Nomads Rugby Club. In 2014, German non-profit organization Make Life Skate Life completed construction of the 7Hills Skatepark, a 650 square meter concrete skatepark located at Samir Rifai park in Downtown Amman.\n\nMedia and music\nThe majority of Jordan's radio stations are based in Amman. The first radio station to originate in the city was Hunna Amman in 1959; it mainly broadcast traditional Bedouin music. In 2000, Amman Net became the first de facto private radio station to be established in the country, despite private ownership of radio stations being illegal at the time. After private ownership was legalized in 2002, several more radio stations were created.\n\nMost Jordanian newspapers and news stations are situated in Amman. Daily newspapers published in Amman include Alghad, Ad-Dustour, The Jordan Times, and Al Ra'i, the most circulated newspaper in the country. In 2011, Al Ra'i was ranked the 5th most popular newspaper in the Arab world by Forbes Middle-East report. Al-Arab Al-Yawm is the only daily pan-Arab newspaper in Jordan. The two most popular Jordanian TV channels, Ro'ya TV and JRTV, are based in Amman.\nAside from mainstream Arabic pop, there is a growing independent music scene in the city which includes many bands that have sizable audiences across the Arab world. Local Ammani bands along with other bands in the Middle East gather in the Roman Theater during the Al-Balad Music Festival held annually in August. Music genres of the local bands are diverse, ranging from heavy metal to Arabic Rock, jazz and rap. Performers include JadaL, Torabyeh, Bilocate, Akher Zapheer, Autostrad and El Morabba3.\n\nEvents\nMany events take place in Amman, including Red Bull-sponsored events Soundclash and Soapbox race, the second part of Jerash Festival, Al-Balad Music Festival, Amman Marathon, Made in Jordan Festival, Amman Book Festival and New Think Festival. Venues for such cultural events often include the Roman and Odeon Theaters downtown, the Ras al Ain Hanger, King Hussein Business Park, Rainbow Theater and Shams Theater, the Royal Film Commission, Shoman libraries and Darat al Funun, and the Royal Cultural Center at Sports City. In addition to large-scale events and institutional planning, scholars point to tactical urbanism as a key element of the city's cultural fabric.\n\nTransportation\nAirports\nThe main airport serving Amman is Queen Alia International Airport, situated about 30 km (18.64 mi) south of Amman. Much smaller is Amman Civil Airport, a one-terminal airport that serves primarily domestic and nearby international routes and the army. Queen Alia International Airport is the major international airport in Jordan and the hub for Royal Jordanian, the flag carrier. Its expansion was recently done and modified, including the decommissioning of the old terminals and the commissioning of new terminals costing $700M, to handle over 16 million passengers annually. It is now considered a state-of-the-art airport and was named 'the best airport in the Middle East' for 2014 and 2015 and 'the best improvement in the Middle East' for 2014 by Airport Service Quality Survey, the world's leading airport passenger satisfaction benchmark program.\n\nRoads\nAmman has an extensive road network. Eight roundabout \"circles\", which formerly marked neighborhoods, are used as landmarks. The road network includes many bridges and tunnels due to the mountainous nature of the terrain. A leading example is the Abdoun Bridge, which spans Wadi Abdoun and connects the 4th Circle to Abdoun Circle. It is considered one of Amman's many landmarks and is the first curved suspended bridge to be built in the country.\n\nSuccessive waves of refugees to the city has led to the rapid construction of new neighborhoods, but Amman's capacity for new or widened roads remains limited despite the influx. This has resulted in increasing traffic jams, particularly during summer when there are large numbers of tourists and Jordanian expatriates visiting. In 2015, a ring road encompassing the city was constructed, which aims to connect the northern and southern parts of the city in order for traffic to be diverted outside Amman and to improve the environmental conditions in the city.\n\nBus and taxi\nThe city has frequent bus connections to other cities in Jordan, as well as to major cities in neighboring countries; the latter are also served by service taxis. Internal transport is served by a number of bus routes and taxis. Service taxis, which most often operate on fixed routes, are readily available and inexpensive. The two main bus and taxi stations are Abdali (near the King Abdullah Mosque, the Parliament and Palace of Justice) and the Raghadan Central Bus Station near the Roman theater in the city center. Popular Jordanian bus company services include JETT and Al-Mahatta. Taxis are the most common way to get around in Amman due their high availability and inexpensiveness.\nThe Amman Bus and the Amman Bus Rapid Transit public transportation systems currently serve the city. Construction work on the BRT system started in 2010, but was halted soon after amid feasibility concerns. Resuming in 2015, the first route of the BRT system was inaugurated in 2021, and the second in 2022. Another BRT route connecting Amman with Zarqa started operations in May 2024.\nThe BRT system in Amman runs on 2 routes: the first from Sweileh in northwest Amman to the Ras Al-Ain area next to downtown Amman, and the second from Sweileh to Mahatta terminal in eastern Amman. Both routes meet at the Sports City intersection. The first route is currently served by three lines: 98, 99 and 100. Ticket price for all lines of Amman Bus and Amman BRT are bought either online via the Amman Bus mobile application or as a rechargeable card in major terminals. Passengers scan their cards or QR codes on phone when boarding the bus, where the price ticket is subtracted from the available balance. The buses are air-conditioned, accessible, monitored with security cameras and have free internet service.\n\nEducation\nAmman is a major regional center of education. The Amman region hosts Jordan's highest concentration of education centers. There are 20 universities in Amman. The University of Jordan is the largest public university in the city. There are 448 private schools in the city attended by 90,000 students, including Jubilee School, Amman Baccalaureate School, Amman Academy, Amman National School, Modern American School, American Community School in Amman, and National Orthodox School.\nUniversities include:\n\nUniversity of Jordan\nAl-Ahliyya Amman University\nAl-Isra University\nAl-Zaytoonah University of Jordan\nAmman Arab University\nApplied Science University\nArab Academy for Banking and Financial Sciences\nArab Open University\nColumbia University: Amman Branch\nGerman-Jordanian University: Amman Branch\nJordan Academy for Maritime Studies\nJordan Academy of Music\nJordan Institute of Banking Studies\nJordan Media Institute\nMiddle East University\nUniversity of Petra\nPhiladelphia University\nPrincess Sumaya University for Technology\nQueen Noor Civil Aviation Technical College\nWorld Islamic Sciences and Education University\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nAmman is twinned with:\n\nGallery\nSee also\nEarly Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East\nRabbath Ammon\nPhiladelphia\nDowntown Amman\nAmman Citadel\nSeil Amman\nList of tallest buildings in Amman\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nAmman Digital Community Facebook page\nGreater Amman Municipality Facebook page\nAmman public transportation map\nPhotos of Amman from the American Center of Research",
      "summary": "Amman is the capital and the largest city of Jordan, and the country's economic, political, and cultural center. With a population of five million as of 2024, Amman is Jordan's primate city and is the largest city in the Levant region, the fifth-largest city in the Arab world, and the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East.\nAmman is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman dates to the 8th millennium BC in 'Ain Ghazal, home to the world's oldest statues of the human form. During the Iron Age, the city was known as Rabat Aman, the capital of the Ammonite Kingdom. In the 3rd century BC, the city was renamed Philadelphia and became one of the ten Greco-Roman cities of the Decapolis. Later, in the 7th century AD, the Rashidun Caliphate renamed the city Amman. Throughout most of the Islamic era, the city alternated between periods of devastation and periods of relative prosperity. Amman was largely abandoned during the Ottoman period from the 15th century until 1878, when it was resettled by Circassians. The city grew after it was connected to the Hejaz Railway in 1904, leading to the formation of its first municipal council in 1909.\nAmman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan's capital in 1921, receiving migrations from different Jordanian and Levantine cities, and later several successive waves of refugees: Palestinians in 1948 and 1967; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003; and Syrians since 2011. It was initially built on seven hills, but now spans over 19 hills combining 22 areas, which are administered by the Greater Amman Municipality. Areas of Amman have gained their names from either the hills (jabal) or the valleys (wadi) they occupy, such as Jabal al-Luweibdeh and Wadi Abdoun. East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities, while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city.\nApproximately one million visitors arrived in Amman in 2018, which made it the 89th most-visited city in the world and the 12th most-visited Arab city. Amman has a relatively fast growing economy and it is ranked as a Beta− global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Moreover, it was named one of the Middle East and North Africa's best cities according to economic, labor, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. The city is among the most popular locations in the Arab world for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices, alongside Doha and only behind Dubai. Amman has a bus network, including a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system that serves the city and connects it to neighboring Zarqa.",

      "content": "عَمَّان هي عاصمه المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه ومركز محافظه العاصمه. تُعد اكبر مدن المملكه وواحده من اكبر المدن العربيه بالنسبه لعدد السكان، اذ بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2023 حوالي 4.8 مليون نسمه، مما يجعلها ايضًا واحده من اسرع المدن نموًا بالسكان بالعالم. تقع المدينه في وسط المملكه على دائره عرض 31 شمالاً وخط طول 35 شرقًا في منطقه تكثر فيها الجبال، فنشات في الوديان بين الجبال اولاً فضاقت على سكانها، فارتقوا سفوحها واستمروا في الاتساع عبر قممها حتى انتشرت المدينه باطرافها فوق 20 جبلا.\nتُعتبر عمّان المركز التجاري والاداري للاردن وقلبه الاقتصادي والتعليمي، حيث اصبحت عمّان نقطه استقطاب للكثير من الجاليات العربيه لموقعها المتميز ولعمارتها المعاصره، كما تستقطب عمّان الكثير من السياح سنويًا من اوروبا الغربيه وامريكا الشماليه واليابان واستراليا ومن الدول العربيه المجاوره والقريبه، وكثيرًا من عائلات دول الخليج العربي تحديدًا، اذ تكثر بها المعالم السياحيه عمومًا والعلاجيه الطبيه خصوصاً. كان من نتيجه وقوع عمّان في مثل هذا الموقع الاستراتيجي في بلاد الشام والشرق الاوسط، ان اصبح موقعها يتحكم بالاقتصاد الوطني ويُحرّك 90% من الاستثمار على المستوى الوطني.\nيرجع تاريخ مدينه عمّان الى الالف السابع قبل الميلاد، وبهذا تُعتبر من ضمن اقدم مدن العالم الماهوله بالسكان الى يومنا هذا. وعمّان مدينه قديمه اقيمت على انقاض مدينه عرفت باسم «ربّه عمّون» ثم «فيلادلفيا» ثم «عمّان» اشتقاقاً من «ربه عمّون»، واتخذها العمّونيون عاصمه لهم. وقد اُنشئت المدينه على تلال سبعه، وكانت مركزًا للمنطقه على ما يبدو في ذلك الوقت، وهي احدى عواصم بلاد الشام الاربع، وهي ايضًا احدى المدن الشاميه القديمه التي اصبحت عاصمهً لاماره شرق الاردن ومن ثم المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه بعد استقلالها في العام 1946 عن بريطانيا.\nيسكن عمّان الحديثه مجموعه متنوعه من السكان من اصول مختلفه اتوا من مختلف المناطق، منهم من اتى من مدن اردنيه قريبه، ومنهم من اتى من فلسطين، ومنهم من القوقاز وسوريا والعراق.\nشهدت امانه عمان الكبرى مؤخرًا تطورًا كبيرًا، حيث توسعت عمان بشكل لم تشهده المدينه من قبل. ونالت خطه مدينه عمّان الشموليه جوائز عالميه منها جائزه القياده العالميه في تخطيط المدن وجائزه المدينه عن قاره اسيا لعام 2007. يبلغ عدد المناطق الاداريه في امانه عمان 22 منطقه مُوزعه جغرافيا تحوي كل منطقه طاقمًا متكاملا من الموظفين، اما من الناحيه الاداريه فهناك مجلس امانه عمان الكبرى الذي يضم 68 عضوا برئاسه امين العاصمه، والمجلس مقسم بدوره الى 14 لجنه مختلفه.\nيُشار بالذكر الى انه تم اعتماد يوم 2 اذار/ مارس من كل عام يومًا لمدينه عمّان بعد اقرار مجلس الوزراء الاردني قرارًا بذلك في بدايه عام 2021، وذلك في اطار الاحتفاء بمرور 100 عام على تاسيس الدوله الاردنيّه.\n\nالتسميه والتاريخ\nالعصور القديمه\nيعود تاريخ عمّان الى اكثر من 7000 سنه قبل الميلاد. وقد مرّت عليها حضارات عديده دلّت عليها الاثار المنتشره في ارجاء المدينه. وخلال هذه الفتره الطويله، شهدت المدينه الكثير من الحضارات، كان اهمها العمونيون. يُعد المدرج الروماني احد اكبر الاثار المتبقيه في المدينه. كما يدل جبل القلعه باثاره المختلفه يدل على الحضارات العمونيه والاغريقيه والرومانيه والبيزنطيه والامويه، بالاضافه الى رجم الملفوف الواقع في جبل عمان والمطل على وادي صقره وهو ما تبقى من حضارات فتره ما قبل التاريخ لعبّاد الطبيعه وعناصرها كالشمس والقمر والنجوم.\n\nيعود اول تواجد بشري في مدينه عمّان في اثار عين غزال شرق العاصمه الى 9 الاف عام من الان. لقد كشفت التنقيبات على ان هذه المنطقه هي من اغنى مواقع العصر الحجري الحديث ما قبل الفخاري، كما ان القريه قد سُكنت دون انقطاع. كانت عين غزال مستوطنه زراعيه ورعويه بُنيت من الحجاره غير المشذبه، وكانت المباني مستطيله الشكل وبجدران مستقيمه، وقد رُصفت الارضيات ثم قصرت بالجبس المدكوك حد اللمعان، وبعد ذلك تم طلائه باللون الاحمر. ان اهم ما يميز موقع عين غزال التماثيل البشريه المُكتشفه، والتي تم العثور عليها في المنطقه الوسطى للموقع على مجموعتين من التماثيل البشريه، والتي تُعد من التماثيل النادره في العالم.\nلقد قدم الى عمّان الحيثيون والهكسوس، ثم قبائل العماليق الاقدمين، تلتهم قبائل بني عمون، او العمونيين، الذين اعطوا المدينه اسمهم فاطلقوا عليها في البدايه اسم ربه عمّون، والربه تعني العاصمه او دار الملك ثم سقطت مع مرور الزمن كلمه ربه وبقيت عمون حتى اطلق عليها الامويون اسم عمّان. اتخذه العمونيون جبل القلعه مقرًا لحكمهم في المدينه، وهو مشرف على وسط عمّان حاليًا.\nقام الاشورويون بالتمدد غربًا نحو منطقه العمونيين، حيث لم يستطيعوا الوقوف بوجههم في بدايه الامر، وانضم العمونييون الى حلف ارامي لمقاومه النفوذ الاشوري في بدايه القرن التاسع قبل الميلاد، ولكن الاشوريين استطاعوا احتلال مملكه العمونيين، وقرر الملك الاشوري سنحاريب منح عمون الاستقلال الذاتي. كان للسيطره الاشوريه اثر في استتباب الامن، مما مكّن العمونييون من السيطره على جزء ٍ كبيرٍ من طرق القوافل التجاريه. قاوم العمونيون البابليين - الذين استمروا في هجومهم على الاجزاء الجنوبيه من الامبراطوريه الاشوريّه، ما اثّر سلبيًا على الوضع الاقتصادي. وفي عهد الملك نبوخذ نصر، استطاع البابليّون السيطره عليها.\n\nورث البابليون املاك الاشوريين في اسيا في عام 612 ق. م. وقد قام ملك مصر بغزو بلاد الشام في عام 590 ق. م، وهي فلسطين وشرقي الاردن. ثم قام نبوخذ نصر ملك البابليين انذاك في عام 586 ق. م بسبي اهالي القدس واعاد البلاد الى سلطانه.\nفي عام 539 ق.م استطاع قورش الفارسي القضاء على الامبراطوريه البابليه واقامه الامبراطوريه الفارسيه، ثم استولى الفرس على فلسطين والاردن، ودخلوا عمّان، واصبحت في تلك الفتره تحت حكم الامبراطوريه الفارسيه. ولقد منح الفرس عمّان حكمًا ذاتيًا في الفتره ما بين 540 ـ 332 ق. م، الا ان الاغريق قَضوا على دوله الفرس عام 332 ق.م، وبدات فتره الامبراطوريه اليونانيه.\nسيطر الاغريق البطالسه على المنطقه بما فيها ربه عمون، التي ابدل اسمها بطليموس الثاني عام 285 ق.م الى اسم «فيلادلفيا»- ويعني مدينه الحب الاخوي؛\nنسبه للقائد «فيلادلفيوس» وجعل من جبل القلعه موقعا للمعابد كجبل الاكروبولس في اثينا. انتعشت في هذا العهد منطقه عراق الامير، نسبه لقصر الملك طوبيا المعروف بعراق الامير، او قصر العبد.\nانقسمت عمان لتصبح جزءاً من الدولتين النبطيه والسلوقيه الى ان استولى عليها الملك الروماني «هيرودس» في العام 30 ق.م. وبهذا تدخل المدينه العهد الروماني ومن ثم البيزنطي حتى منصف القرن السابع.\nالعصر الروماني والبيزنطي\n\nامتد العهد الروماني ثم البيزنطي من 63 - 636. واصبحت المدينه جزءًا من حلف الديكابولس، وهو تحالف كان يضم عشره مدن تقع اليوم في الاردن وسوريا وفلسطين. لقد اُعيد بناء فيلادلفيا ايام الحكم الروماني لتشمل مدرج وشوارع مرصوفه واعمده على الطراز الروماني. ايام الحكم البيزنطي كانت مقر الكرسي المسيحي وبُنيَت الكثير من الكنائس ولكن المدينه لم تعد مزدهره كما كانت. وقد وصلها الفرس في عام 614م واعادوا احتلالها، لكن حكمهم كان قصيرا وانتهى قبيل وصول جيوش المسلمين اليها بعد عده سنوات.\nيوجد في المدينه اثار رومانيه ما زالت قائمه ليومنا هذا، اهمها ساحه الفورم والمدرج الروماني. يقع الفورم بين جبل القلعه وجبل الجوفه امام المدرج الروماني بوسط عمان. تبلغ مساحه الفورم والمسرح ما مجموعه 7600 متر مربع ويعود تاريخ بنائهما على الارجح الى القرن الثاني الميلادي وتحديدًا بين عامي 138م و 161م ابان عهد القيصر انطونيوس بيوس. اليوم بني الى جانب الفورم حديقه ذات نوافير عده، تستعمل كماوى للهروب من ازمه المرور وزحمه التسوق في وسط مدينه عمان. كانت الساحه محاطه من ثلاث جهات بشوراع اعمده، التي يشاهد المرء منها اليوم فقط الاعمده الواقعه في الجزء الجنوبي من الساحه، المتاخمه للمدرج. بنى الرومان، نظام تصريف للمياه تحت الساحه.\nاما البيزنطيون فيتركون كنائس عده، حيث كشفت حفريات دائره الاثار العامه في عمّان، عن كنائس تعود الى فتره القرن الرابع الميلادي وحتى الثامن، اثناء حكم البيزنطيين للمنطقه في ضواحي المدينه في كل من: الصويفيه، خلدا، الرابيه، الجبيهه، ياجوز، البصه، القويسمه، رجم الكرسي، اللويبده في داره الفنون، حسبان التي تبعد عن عمان 20 كيلو مترا، والجبل الاخضر.\n\nالعصر الاسلامي\nبدا هذا العصر بعد الفتح الاسلامي للشام في 635، واستطاع جيش يزيد بن ابي سفيان ان يفتح عمّان، وتنتهي بذلك دوله الغساسنه التابعه للبيزنطيين، والمتحكمه بمنطقه البلقاء التي كانت عمان جزءا منها، وعادت المدينه لتُعرف باسمها السامي القديم ثانيه: عمّان او عمّون.\n\nفي العصر الاموي، بنى الامويون قصرًا كبيرًا على جبل القلعه، وغدت عمّان مركزًا اداريًا، يقيم فيها الامير، وتضرب فيها النقود، وتقوم حاميتها بمراقبه طريق القوافل التجاريه، وحراسه طريق الحج، وبرك الماء كبركه زيزاء والقسطل. وعندما الت الامور الى الدوله العباسيه، جرت على ارض كوره عمان (مركز اداري) معارك دُمّرت فيها الاسوار والحصون في مواجهه عسكريه داخليه. ويشير المؤرخون الى ان العباسيين تحصنوا في عمّان عندما ثار بعض الامويين مطالبين بالخلافه في عهد الخليفه المامون بن الرشيد.\n\nكانت عمّان في عهد الفاطميين مركزًا لتجميع القوات، ولكن في اواخر حكمهم في القرن الحادي عشر الميلادي بدات الضغوط الخارجيه بقدوم الصليبيين. وفي سنه 1184 مر صلاح الدين الايوبي بعمّان في طريقه الى الكرك، واصبحت في تلك الفتره جزءًا من دوله الايوبيين. امّا في عهد المماليك، فقد شهدت عمان استقرارًا، وازدهرت اسواقها في مواسم الحج. لقد حظيت عمّان باهتمام الظاهر بيبرس ورعايته عندما اعتلى عرش دوله المماليك في مصر والشام. وفي عهد السلطان قلاوون عام 1279، انتقلت الولايه من السلط الى عمّان، وفي عام 1355 بنى المماليك مدرسه في عمان لتدريس المذهب الحنفي.\nفي عام 1516 توالى على حكم الامبراطوريه العثمانيه عدد من السلاطين، واستطاع الاتراك العثمانيون دخول عمّان، الا انها بعد ذلك دخلت دفتر النسيان والاهمال حتى نهايه القرن التاسع عشر، نتيجه لعده زلازل ضربتها وانتشار الاوبئه مثل الطاعون، حيث بدات منذ 1878، تشهد تزايدًا في اعداد السكان، اذ قامت السلطات العثمانيه بالسماح لعدد من العائلات الشركسيه (المهاجره من اضطهاد القيصر الروسي) بالسكن في عمّان. وتجدر الاشاره الى ان متحف الاثار الاردني به نماذج من اثار هذه الحضارات كلها عبر عصورها المتتاليه.\nقال عنها المقدسي في كتابه: «احسن التقاسيم في معرفه الاقاليم»، ان مدينه عمّان هي واحده من ضمن ثلاث مدن تشبه مكه، حيث يقول: «رايت لها ثلاث نظائر: عمّان بالشام، واصطخر بفارس، وقريه الحمراء بخراسان». وقد جاء ذكر عمّان في كتب ادب الرحلات العربيه، فقد اورد عنها في كتاب معجم البلدان لياقوت الحموي ثلاث ابيات شعر قال فيها الاحوص بن محمد الانصاري:\n\nعمّان الحديثه\nتاسست عمّان الحديثه في نهايه القرن التاسع عشر مع وصول طلائع المهاجرين الشركس من قبائل الشابسوغ ليستقروا قرب سيل عمان والمدرج الروماني عام 1878، نتيجه تهجيرهم القسري بالقوه المسلحه من قبل القوات الروسيه القيصريه التي استطاعت اكمال احتلال وطنهم الام شمال القوقاز عام 1864 بعد قتال شركسي ضد هذه القوات التي كانت تعتبر من اقوى الجيوش الاوروبيه طيله ما يزيد عن مئه عام. ثم عملت على تفريغ وطنهم القومي التاريخي بتهجيرهم الى الدوله العثمانيه المجاوره، لاحلال مستوطنين من الشعوب المواليه للروس كالقوزاق والجورجيين والاوكرانيين الروس انفسهم. كانت شرق الاردن احدى المناطق العثمانيه في ذلك الوقت والتي انزلت فيها الدوله العثمانيه الشراكسه المهجّرين، وكانت عمّان المدينه الاثريه اولى مناطق الاردن التي نزل فيها الشراكسه منذ عام 1878. كان هؤلاء المهاجرون الشراكسه من الفلاحين الذين عملوا على زراعه الارض وتربيه الماشيه وبناء بيوتهم ومساجدهم، حيث وزعت عليهم السلطات العثمانيه الاراضي الصالحه للزراعه، مما انعش القريه واعاد اليها الحياه. بعد ذلك اصبحت عمان عامل جذب لقدوم المزيد من السكان اليها من مختلف الجهات. وكانت عمّان ضمن المناطق التي سُكنت لوجود المياه فيها بوفره، وفي عام 1933، بلغ عدد الشركس فيها 1,700 نسمه.\nلقد توالت على عمان مجموعات اخرى من المهاجرين الشراكسه القادمين من شمال القوقاز بعد احتلال بلادهم من قبل الجيوش الروسيه القيصريه عام 1864، فسكنوا في احياء ما زالت تحمل اسماءها حتى اليوم مثل حي المهاجرين وحي الشابسوغ وحي القبرطاي ومحلّه الابزاخ. تتابع قدوم الناس الى عمّان والاستقرار فيها عبر السنين التاليه، فقدمت جماعات من الارمن والاكراد والشيشان والشوام والمقدسيين والحجازيين وغيرهم مما اضفى على المجتمع الاردني تنوعا عرقياً شكل جزءا هاما من نسيجه.\nلقد عزمت الدوله العثمانيه في نهايه القرن التاسع على انشاء ولايه في المنطقه يكون مركزها عمان. وقد جاء في مشروع الولايه المقترح: «فالبلد السوري، يتكون حالياً من ولايه دمشق، وولايه بيروت، ومتصرفيه القدس الشريف. غير ان هذه المنطقه شاسعه، تكاد تبلغ مساحتها نصف مساحه الاناضول. وهي مناطق عامره، فيمكن تشكيل ولايه فيها، على ان تكون عاصمتها عمان، وان يطلق على الولايه اسم ولايه عمّان او معموره الحميديه، ويُتخذ في معان والشوبك وحسبان والسلط وعين الزرقاء وباقي الاماكن قائم مقاميات». وكان السبب في اقتراح فكره الولايه الحميديه ان تشكيل ولايه عمّان سيعمل على ضمان الامن على الطريق التي تخترقها ابتداء من دمشق حتى المدينه المنوره. اذ ترافق ذلك مع تفكير الدوله العثمانيه بانشاء سكه حديد، تبدا من دمشق وتصل الى اليمن، على طول الساحل الشرقي للبحر الاحمر. غير ان كمال باشا، صاحب فكره المشروع المقترح، ابدى تخوفه من ان تتعرض هذه الطريق لهجوم قوى اجنبيه، كالانجليز، الذين يحاولون احتلال مصر، مما يعرقل حركه القوات العثمانيه الذاهبه الى الحجاز واليمن.\nعلى الرغم من ان مشروع الولايه الجديده ظل فكره، ولم يُطبّق، الا انه بقي حاضرًا في اذهان السياسيين والعسكريين العثمانيين اثناء ادارتهم لهواجس ومخاطر الامن الداخلي والخارجي. فقاموا بدءًا من العام 1878، بتشجيع استقرار الشركس والشيشان، على طول خط استراتيجي، يمتد من منبج وحمص والجولان فعمّان، حيث كانت الاضطرابات والعصيان على الدوله امرًا مالوفًا. ولم يدرك الشركس ابعاد هذا الدور، ووجدوا انفسهم حين وصلوا الى البلقاء في العراء. وواجهوا المصاعب بالصبر والجهد والتحدي، معتمدين على انفسهم. وقد بدؤوا باستصلاح الاراضي وزارعتها، وشرعوا ببناء قرى جديده هنا وهناك، فكانت عمّان وناعور ووادي السير وصويلح وغيرها. جاء الشركس في بدايه وصولهم الى عمّان، قادمين من نابلس ومنطقه خربه الشركس التابعه للواء عكا. وكان اغلب الفوج الاول من المهاجرين الشركس، في العام 1878، يتكون من قبيله الشابسوغ، حيث سكنوا بين الابنيه الاثريه للمدينه، وفي دهاليز المدرج الروماني والكهوف المحيطه به.\nاسهم الخط الحديدي الحجازي في زياده ملحوظه بعدد سكان المدينه، لا سيما عندما رُبطت به المدينه عبر محطه عمان التي تبعد عن مركز المدينه خمسه كيلومترات، وذلك عام 1903. لذلك اخذت اوضاع عمّان السكانيه والاقتصاديه تشهد تطورًا تدريجيًا بطيئًا، فاُنشئ اول مجلس بلدي في المدينه عام 1909، وغدت مركزاً لمديريه الناحيه عام 1914، وقد كانت عمان قبل تاسيس الاردن الحديث سنه 1921، مركزًا مهمًا رغم قله عدد سكانها مقارنه ببعض المدن المجاوره كالسلط ونابلس والقدس، حيث كانت اشبه بقريه كبيره طيله تلك الفتره. وقُدّر عدد سكانها بعد انتهاء الحرب العالميه الاولى بما بين 1500 و 2000 نسمه او اكثر بقليل، معظمهم من الشراكسه المهاجرين، الذين تمركزوا في وسط البلد في احياء المهاجرين والشابسوغ والقبرطاي ومحله الابزاخ والاشرفيه وجبل التاج واجزاء من جبل عمان.\nمئويه امانه عمّان الكبرى\n\nاحتفلت امانه عمان الكبرى عام 2009 بالذكرى المئويه لتاسيسها، اذ تاسس اول مجلس بلدي عام 1909 كون مسيره المائه عام الماضيه من عمر عمّان شهدت تطورًا كبيرًا في شتى الميادين، وتدرجت من قريه صغيره الى عاصمه حديثه ومن مجلس بلدي الى امانه عمان الكبرى، وتخطت العديد من الصعاب والتحديات، فضلا عن تطور مفهوم ومستوى ونوعيه الخدمات التي تقدم للعمانيين.\nلقد تعاقب على رئاسه المدينه، خلال مئه عام، منذ تاسيس مجلسها البلدي الاول عام 1909 وحتى العام 2009، ثمانيه عشر رئيسا للبلديه (1909-1950)، واربعه عشر امينًا للعاصمه (1950-1987)، وتسعه امناء لعمّان الكبرى (1987-2015).\n\nجغرافيا\nتقع عمّان على عده جبال، وترتفع عن سطح البحر قرابه 750 مترًا، ومتوسط ارتفاع جبالها السبع الاولى التي اُنشئت عليها 918 متر. تقع مدينه العقبه على بعد 360 كيلومترًا جنوبها، ومدينه اربد على مسافه تقارب من 80 كيلومترًا شمالها. بينما يقع نهر الاردن على مسافه 45 كيلومترًا الى الغرب منها. اما عن مدن الجوار فتبعد القدس عنها بمسافه 80 كيلومترًا الى الغرب، ودمشق مسافه 180 كيلومترًا الى الشمال، وبغداد مسافه 800 كيلومترًا الى الشرق، اما مكه المكرمه فتقع على مسافه 1225 كيلومترًا الى الجنوب.\n\nالتضاريس\nتمتد عمّان بشكل رئيسي فوق عشرين جبلاً تقريبًا على طول المدينه وعرضها ومن اهم جبالها السبعه الاوائل وهي جبل القصور، جبل الجوفه، جبل التاج، جبل النزهه، جبل النصر، جبل الاشرفيه، جبل النظيف، والجبل الاخضر. بالاضافه الى جبل عمان وجبل اللويبده وجبل الحسين وجبل القلعه. معظمها موجود الان ضمن عمان الشرقيه، وتتنوع في المدينه التضاريس كالتالي:\n\nالمنطقه الشماليه، وتتكون من عده جبال متموّجه نوعًا ما، كما في الجبيهه وشفا بدران وابو نصير.\nالمنطقه الوسطى، تتميز بانها ملتقى الاوديه مع سيل عمان، وهي اوديه شديده الانحدار تتخللها النتوءات الصخريه البارزه وطبقات صخريه متموّجه على سفوح الجبال التي تمر من خلالها، مثل وادي عبدون ووادي صقره ووادي الحداده.\nالمنطقه الغربيه، تمتد على جانب غور الاردن، ويتجاوز ارتفاعها 1000 متر كما في تلاع العلي والشميساني وصويلح.\nالمنطقه الشرقيه والجنوبيه الشرقيه، وتتميز بسطحها المتموج، وتعد من الاراضي الصحراويه القاحله الممتده الى الصحراء الاردنيه، كما في ماركا الجنوبيه والقويسمه.\n\nتنظيم المدينه\nتنقسم عمان الى جزئين رئيسيين وهما:\n\nعمان الشرقيه وهي الجزء الاقدم من المدينه.\nعمان الغربيه وهي الجزء الاحدث من المدينه.\nكانت عمان مقتصره على الشركس في نهايات القرن التاسع عشر وحتى بدايه القرن العشرين، ولكن بعد اعلانها عاصمه لاماره شرق الاردن ومن بعدها المملكه الاردنيه الهاشميه ازداد التوسع العمراني ووفِدَ اليها الناس من مختلف المناطق، وبدات مدينه عمان الحديثه بالتوسع في عقد الخمسينات والستينات من القرن الماضي حيث اخذت احياء جديده في الظهور في عمان الغربيه.\nفي بدايه عام 2007 قررت امانه عمان الكبرى، ضم اراض قريبه من مطار الملكه علياء الدولي جنوب العاصمه، لتصبح جزءا من مناطق المدينه، مثل الجيزه ومرج الحمام وسحاب، مما ضاعف مساحه عمان لتصبح 1,680 كم². وضمن الخطه للسنوات المقبله، تتجه الامانه الى التوسع العمراني نحو المناطق الشرقيه والجنوبيه حيث سهوله استغلال الاراضي المنبسطه. وضمن المخططات لتوفير الخدمات لهذه المناطق الجديده تستعد الامانه لاقامه مشروع خط قطارات خفيفه بين المناطق الجنوبيه لعمّان وصولا الى الزرقاء شرقا على امتداد 26 كيلومتر.\nكما شهدت عمّان الغربيه نموا سريعا في العقدين الاخيرين حيث ظهرت احياء باكملها. وتحاول امانه عمّان اقامه مشاريع تنمويه طموحه في شرق عمّان خلال الفتره الحاليه.\n مناطق عمان\nالقائمه التاليه باسماء مناطق عمان الكبرى الاثنان والعشرين والتي تقع ضمن عمان الغربيه وعمان الشرقيه:\n\nالغطاء الاخضر\n\nتتنوع التضاريس في مناطق عمّان الريفيه بين السهول والجبال العاليه والوديان، وتحيط الاماكن السياحيه بجميع انحاء العاصمه حيث منتزه عمّان القومي وحدائق البحرين والمدينه المائيه جنوبا، مرورا بالطبيعه الجميله في وادي السير وام الاسود والحمر وماحص غربا، وانتهاء بقرى زي ودبين شمالا.\nيكاد يخلو وسط مدينه عمّان من الغابات فيما عدا بعض الاماكن مثل المدينه الرياضيه والجامعه الاردنيه وحدائق الحسين، وحدائق الملك عبد الله بالمقابلين، وغابات اخرى على طريق المطار.\nيُشار الى ان زراعه الغابات قد بدات في الاردن منذ اكثر من 60 عاماً مضت. وتجري معظم انشطه التشجير حول العاصمه والمدن السكنيه بالاضافه الى زراعات جوانب الطرق، ومصدّات الرياح والزراعات في مجاري الوديان. تُزرع الاشجار ايضاً كجزء متكامل من نظم مندمجات الزراعه والغابات.\nفي عام 1995 تضمنت الزراعات حوالي 1000 كيلومتر من الاشجار على طول الطرق، 7000 كيلومتر من مصدات الرياح واحزمه الوقايه و 500 كيلومتر من الاشجار على طول جوانب المجاري المائيه.\n\nالمناخ\nالطقس في عمّان معتدل بشكل عام، اذ يسود مناخ متوسطي معظم مناطق العاصمه، خصوصًا في المرتفعات. بينما يسود بعض مناطقها المناخ شبه الصحراوي وخاصه في المناطق الشرقيه منها. ترتفع درجات الحراره صيفًا، وتصل اعلى مستوياتها في منتصف اب/ اغسطس، حيث تصل في بعض الاحيان الى منتصف الثلاثينات مئويه. وتنخفض الحراره شتاء لتصل في كانون الثاني/ يناير احيانًا الى الصفر او ما دونه، حيث يتسبب ذلك بتساقط الثلوج على المرتفعات. ويعتدل المناخ في فصلي الربيع والخريف.\nاما بالنسبه لمعدلات الامطار فتكون معدومه في بعض الاشهر مثل حزيران وتموز واب. بينما تكون في اعلى معدلاتها في شهري كانون الثاني وشباط، حيث يمكن ان يصل مستواها الى اكثر من 170 ميليمترًا.\n\nالسكان\nيعود اول تواجد بشري في مدينه عمّان الى 9 الاف عام، حيث تشير اثار عين غزال شرق العاصمه الى هذا. وخلال هذه الفتره الطويله، شهدت المدينه الكثير من الحضارات كان اهمها العمونيون، وبعد ذلك احتل المدينه كل من اليونان والفرس والرومان والبيزنطيون. وبعد الفتح الاسلامي لبلاد الشام استمر التواجد البشري فيها حتى دخلت دفتر النسيان في نهايه العصر المملوكي اي في القرن السادس عشر، الى ان تم اعاده اكتشافها في نهايه القرن التاسع عشر، وهجره شعوب مختلفه من القوقاز، الذين تعرض كل منهم لاضطهاد في بلاده، فقامت الدوله العثمانيه بتوزيعهم على اراضيها، وكانت عمان من هذه الاراضي. وبهذا، يبدا تاريخ التواجد البشري في عمان الحديثه، حيث بدات الحياه تدب في عمّان المعاصره شيئا فشيئا بعد هجره الشركس في بادئ الامر من القوقاز عام 1880 او قبله بقليل، وخاصه الى محلتي الشابسوغ والمهاجرين، ومن ثم هجره كل من الارمن والشيشان. ثم مالبثت ان استقبلت المدينه الكثير من العرب من مختلف المناطق، وبالاخص ذوي الاصول الاردنيه (الذين سكن بعضهم تجمعات محدده، مثل حي الطفايله الذي يعد اكبر تجمعي لابناء المحافظات في العاصمه ويقع في جبل الجوفه)، مع المواطنين ذوي الاصول الفلسطينيه الذين هاجروا من مختلف مناطق فلسطين، والذين تزايدوا بشكل كبير، حتى اصبح العرب هم الغالبيه المطلقه.\n\nالتركيبه السكانيه\nتعتبر عمّان من اكثر المدن تسارعا بالنمو في منطقه الشرق الاوسط، ويقطنها مايزيد عن ثلث سكان المملكه. ويبلغ عدد سكان عمّان الكبرى بضواحيها اليوم حوالي 4 ملايين نسمه، يدين الغالبيه الساحقه منهم بالاسلام. كما يُعتبر المسيحيون من العرب والارمن وغيرهم، المكون الديني الثاني بعد المسلمين، ويشكلون ما نسبته 6% من السكان من مختلف الطوائف. كما يكفل الدستور الاردني للجميع حريه ممارسه الاديان. يُشار الى ان عدد سكان المدينه قد ازداد بشكل ملحوظ بعد عده منعطفات مهمه شهدتها المنطقه كان اولها حرب 1948 وحرب 1967، حيث لجا ونزح مئات الالاف من فلسطين. كما كان لاحداث حرب الخليج الثانيه دور كبير بازدياد العدد، حيث عاد مئات الالاف من الاردنيين من الكويت وباقي دول الخليج بين عاميّ 1991 و 1992. هذا بالاضافه الى تضاعف مساحه المدينه بعد ضم ضواحي كبيره اليها في عام 2007 (شكلت عمّان الكبرى). كما يشكل اليوم المقيمون العرب من الدول المجاوره، وخاصه من سوريا والعراق، جزءًا لا باس به من سكان المدينه، والذين ازدادت اعدادهم بشكل كبير بعد كل من الغزو الامريكي للعراق والازمه السوريه. بالاضافه الى وجود مئات الالاف من العمّال والعاملات المقيمين من الدول الاسيويه ومصر. كما تتواجد جاليات غربيه عديده، يوجد لمعظمها معاهد ثقافيه ومدارس اكاديميه. قدّرت امانه عمان الكبرى ان عدد سكان المدينه، دون القرى التابعه لها، سيصل سنه 2025 الى حوالي 6.4 مليون نسمه، اي ثلاثه اضعاف الرقم لعام 2007.\nان المجتمع العمّاني حاليًا هو خليط من عائلات ذات اصول مختلفه؛ شرق اردنيه، وفلسطينيه، وحجازيه، وسوريه، واقليه من الشركس والشيشان والارمن والتركمان والاكراد. ولقد ظهر من هذا المكون الكثير من المشاهير الذين ساهموا بنهضه المدينه والبلد بشكل عام على جميع الاصعده والمجالات، كالادب والفنون والهندسه والطب والرياضه والاعلام والاقتصاد والتكنلوجيا والتعليم والسياسه والجيش.\nباستثناء بعض من عشائر البلقاء (كاللوزي وابو قوره والعبد اللات والعدوان)، فلا يوجد فعليا مِن سكّان عمّان مَن هم ذو اصول عمّانيه، ولكن هناك اجيال نشات منذ ما يزيد عن قرن بعد هجره مئات الالاف من هذه المناطق المجاوره، ومن ضمنها المدن الاردنيه القريبه كالسلط واربد والطفيله والكرك ومعان. ياتي هذا بعد خلو المدينه تقريبا من سكانها لعده قرون - منذ القرن السادس عشر، نتيجه للزلازل وانتشار الاوبئه كالطاعون، بالاضافه الى اهمال العثمانيين لها في معظم فتره حكمهم لـبلاد الشام.\n\nاللاجئون\nكانت عمّان تستقبل المزيد من السكان عبر العقود السته الماضيه من دول ابتلي اهلها بالحروب والثورات. وقد استقبلت المدينه كغيرها من مدن الاردن العديد من اللاجئين من دول الجوار خلال ازمات القرن الماضي وبالاخص من فلسطين ولبنان والعراق وسوريا. يطيب للبعض البقاء والاستقرار في عمّان ويختار البعض الاخر العوده الى بلاده عند استقرار الامور فيها او متابعه الهجره الى دول اخرى. ينصهر الكثيرون في المجتمع العمّاني ولكن تبقى فئه في تجمعات سكانيه تحمل هويتهم الاصليه كمخيمات اللاجئين الفلسطينيين. فبالرغم من الانصهار الكبير الذي حدث ببينهم وبين معظم فئات المجتمع الا انه لا زال عدد منهم يعيش في المخيمات. وبحسب احصاءات وكاله الغوث التابعه للامم المتحده، يقطن هذه المخيمات قرابه 20% من فلسطينيي الاردن. تقوم وكاله الغوث، او الاونروا، بالاشراف على جميع المخيمات العشره في المملكه والتي تشمل مخيمات عمان الاربعه منذ النكبه، وهي مخيم البقعه ومخيم الوحدات ومخيم ماركا (شنلر) ومخيم الحسين.\nيُشار بالذكر الى ان المدينه تستضيف مئات اللاجئين من دول بعيده نسبيًا، كالصومال والسودان وجنوب السودان، حيث يتواجد على ارض الاردن بشكل عام 44 جنسيه لاجئه حسب تقرير نشرته المفوضيه الساميه للامم المتحده لشؤون اللاجئين عام 2014.\n\nالمواصلات والاتصالات\nالنقل والطرق\nشكّل التخطيط المدني القديم لعمّان تحديا لمواكبه تطورات العصر واحتياجات المدينه، وعمّان ليست بالمدينه الثريه، ولكنها تمكنت من تخطي الصعاب وما زالت تُنشئ طرقا جديده تحل ازمات المدينه السابقه. اذ توجد الان في عمّان عده طرق سريعه، تربط اجزاء المدينه بعضها ببعض كما تربطها بمدن المملكه الاخرى، فهناك شارع الاردن وشارع الاستقلال وشارع الشهيد والحزام الدائري وطريق ياجوز وشارع المدينه الطبيه وشارع الجامعه واوتوستراد الزرقاء وشارع المطار، والطريق الصحراوي. ويعتبر جسر عبدون المعلق ونفق وادي الحداده وطريق عمان التنموي وغيرها من منشات الطرق الجديده من اهم مشاريع امانه عمان الكبرى للتخفيف من وطاه الزحام في الشوارع.\n\nبدات امانه عمّان الكبرى مشروع الباص السريع (BRT) في عام 2010. تعتبر شبكه الحافلات السريعه من اهم مشاريع النقل التي تشهدها عمّان حتى يومنا هذا، اذ يهدف هذا المشروع - والذي انتهى تنفيذ مرحلته الاولى في عام 2012 الا ان حكومه رئيس الوزراء معروف البخيت اوقفت المرحله الثانيه منه لوجود شبهه فساد - الى احداث نقله نوعيّه في واقع الحركه والتنقّل في المدينه – نقله تمهّد الطريق للوصول الى مدينه عصريه مستدامه قابله للحياه. ان فكره خط الباصات السريعه تعتمد على تخصيص مسارب لحركه باصات النقل العام، ويحظر على المركبات الاخرى استخدام هذه المسارب. وبذلك يمكن نقل اعداد كبيره من الناس من خلال هذه المسارب بسرعه وسهوله. ويمكن ان تصل سعه النقل لكل مسرب حوالي 40,000 راكب في الساعه في كل اتجاه، بينما لا تتجاوز سعه النقل في المسارب التقليديه التي تستخدمها السيارات والحافلات والمركبات الاخرى الـ 3,250 راكباً. وبالاضافه الى ذلك، فان تكلفه بناء خطوط الباصات السريعه مقبوله جداً، وقد لا تتجاوز 5% من تكلفه بناء نظام نقل يعتمد على السكك الحديديه مثلاً. كذلك استهلاكها للطاقه وكميه الانبعاثات الكليه الناجمه عن النقل بالباصات اقل من تلك الناتجه عن النقل بالسيارات العاديه. الاّ ان المشروع قد اثار جدلا كبيرا في الفتره الحاليه بعد توقفه، مما سبّب باتهامات شعبيه كثيره للقائمين عليه.\n\nاما خدمات النقل التقليديه في عمان فهي موزعه بين الحافلات والسيارات، وهناك شبكه من السيارات للنقل العام تدعى «سرفيس» اي انها تسير في خطوط محدده ويتشارك الركاب باستخدامها ودفع اجرتها. كما يوجد شبكه من سيارات الاجره التي تلبي الطلبات الخاصه موزعه في جميع انحاء المدينه. ذلك عدا عن السيارات السياحيه التي تُؤجر ليقودها السائح بنفسه. هذا بالاضافه الى خدمه التاكسي المميز، وخدمه النقل باستخدام التطبيقات الذكيه (مثل تطبيقات كريم واوبر). كما ان شبكات الحافلات ضمن خدمات النقل العام تؤدي الغرض نفسه. ويوجد في المدينه مجمعان كبيران للحافلات هي مجمع باصات الشمال، والمجمع الجنوبي.\n\nالاتصالات\nنهجت الاردن في مجال الاتصالات بصوره مقبوله فمن شبكه كادت ان تكون غير مجديه في الثمانينات الى خصخصه الاتصالات، واليوم هناك عده شركات خاصه تقدم خدمه الانترنت وثلاث شركات لتقديم خدمه الهاتف المحمول وشبكه اتصالات ارضيه متميزه ووفره في ارقام الهاتف.\n\nالطيران\nلعمّان مطاران: مطار الملكه علياء الدولي الذي اُنجز عام 1983 ومطار عمان المدني الذي يُستخدم للطيران المدني الاقليمي وللطيران العسكري. وهذان المطاران تنطلق منهما عده خطوط طيران، وشركه طيران الملكيه الاردنيه تستخدم مطار الملكه علياء كما تستخدمه جميع شركات الطيران الدولي الاخرى. اما شركه طيران الاردنيه فتستخدم مطار عمان وكذلك شركات الطيران التي تطير ضمن الاقليم فقط. يشار بالذكر الى انه تم رفع القدره الاستيعابيه لمطار الملكه علياء من 3.2 مليون مسافر /السنه الى 9 ملايين عند اكتمال اعمال الانشاءات عام 2012 ليصبح واحدا من اهم الوجهات العالميه في المنطقه.\n\nسكه الحديد\nيمر بالمدينه خط سكه حديد الحجاز حيث توجد محطه عمان على الخط بين بلاد الشام ومكه المكرمه انطلاقاً من دمشق والذي توقف العمل به منذ بدايات القرن العشرين، ويُعتبر المبنى الاثري للمحطه من معالم عمّان التاريخيه. وتقع المحطه في منطقه عمان الشرقيه غرب منطقه ماركا وشرق المدرج الروماني بالقرب من مطار ماركا الدولي. يُستخدم هذا الخط الان لنقل الركاب والبضائع بين عمّان ودمشق فقط. ويعمل الاردن على الاستفاده من بعض املاك هذا الخط في بناء مشروع اخر يعود جزء من ارباحه على الخط الحجازي، حيث سيمتد مشروع خط قطارات خفيفه بين المناطق الجنوبيه لعمّان وصولاً الى الزرقاء شرقاً والذي سيمتد لمسافه 26 كيلومتر.\n\nالعماره والتخطيط الحضري\nالتخطيط العمراني\nاتبعت المدينه في نموها العشوائي في بادئ الامر، نظريه النمو حول نواه واحده، حيث كانت هذه النواه هي المسجد الحسيني والمنطقه التجاريه الممتده من راس العين الى موقع المكتبه الوطنيه (مقر امانه عمّان القديم) وعلى جانبي وادي سيل عمّان. الا ان عمليه النمو لم تكن حلقيه او دائريه حول النواه، بل تميزت باضافه قطاعات متفاوته المساحه في المرحله الواحده ومختلفه في اتجاهات نموها خلال المراحل المختلفه. حيث كان نمو المدينه ياتي على شكل تشنجات مفاجئه نتجت عن عوامل سياسيه مرت بها المنطقه، ادت الى انفجارات سكانيه غير متوقعه. حيث اثرت بدورها على الطابع المعماري للمدينه والذي تكوّن بشكل تراكمي طيله القرن الفائت. ان التوسع الذي شهدته عمّان في هذه المرحله كان باتجاهين: الاول على الطريق الواصل بين وسط البلد ووادي السير، والثانيه بين وسط البلد والسلط عن طريق صويلح، حيث رُبطت هاتان المنطقتان بعمّان. وعلى طول مسار هذين الطريقين انتشرت دواوير عمّان وميادينها، التي هي شاهد على مراحل تطور المدينه.\nفي عام 1956، وُضِّع اول مخطط هيكلي لعمّان بمعناه الصحيح، يحدد شكل المدينه ووظائفها والاستعمالات المختلفه وخطوط النقل والمواصلات وغيرها من الخصائص العامه. وفي عام 1964 باشرت امانه العاصمه بوضع الانظمه التفصيليه التي ساهمت فيما بعد بتطبيق محتويات المخططات التنظيميه التي اشرف على وضعها قسم التخطيط في الامانه بالتعاون مع بعض الخبراء بالامم المتحده.\n\nالا ان الزياده غير المتوقعه في عدد السكان بالمدينه نتيجه الحروب المتلاحقه في المنطقه، ادى الى عدم تبني المخطط الشمولي القديم، وان كان هناك عده محاولات اخرى، الا انها كانت تصطدم ايضا بنفس المشكله. اما مؤخرا، فقد شهدت امانه عمان الكبرى تطورا كبيرا، حيث توسعت عمان بشكل مدروس لم تشهده المدينه من قبل. ونالت خطه مدينه عمان الشموليه جوائز عالميه منها جائزه القياده العالميه في تخطيط المدن وجائزه المدينه عن قاره اسيا لعام 2007.\nان من اهم المشكلات الاجتماعيه الحضريه في عمّان حاليا، هي الطفره الكبيره في النمو السكاني والحضري. ومع زياده عدد السكان، واجهت المدينه عده مشاكل منها: ظهور مناطق عشوائيه، نقص المساكن، عدم كفايه المياه، مشكله المرور داخل المدينه.\n\nتبلغ مساحه الاراضي المبنيه في عمّان 640 كم² بنسبه 38% من اجمالي مساحه مناطق الامانه البالغه 1668 كم²، ووالاراضي غير المبنيه 1027 كم² بنسبه 62%. كما تبين ان مساحات الاراضي التجاريه 20 كم² بنسبه 5%، والاراضي الصناعيه 65 كم² بنسبه 15%، والمرافق العامه (مؤسسات حكوميه، مدارس، الحدائق العامه...) 20 كم² بنسبه 5%، والاراضي الزراعيه 21 كم² بنسبه 5%.\nبالاضافه الى شوارع عمّان التي تشكل مساحتها 191 كم² بنسبه 11% من مساحه مناطق الامانه، تعتبر الادراج من سمات مدينه عمان العريقه، حيث تنتشر على سفوح جبالها لتصل البيوت ببعضها البعض حين تعجز الشوارع عن اداء تلك المهمه، اذ يخيل لزائر عمان انها مدينه تقف على قدميها باستمرار، وقد اتخذت بعض بيوتها مواقع لها، ولم يكن ممكنا وصلها مع باقي اجزاء المدينه الا بواسطه الدرج. وبهذا تعتبر هذه الادراج القديمه بحدّ ذاتها معلما تاريخيا. ومن هذه الادراج: الكلحه، اللويبده، رغدان وبسمان. ولقد تم مؤخرًا تحديد مناطق الابراج باربع مناطق فقط هي: المركز التجاري الجديد لمنطقه العبدلي، مركز تقاطعات الطرق الرئيسه (على امتداد ممر وادي عبدون)، بوابه عمان الشماليه (وتقع في الجبيهه بمحاذاه شارع الاردن)، بوابه عمان الجنوبيه (هي المنطقه المتاخمه من الناحيه الشرقيه لطريق المطار ومحاط بالطريق الدائري لوادي عبدون).\n\nالنسيج الحضري\nتشغل المناطق السكنيه الجانب الاكبر من مساحه عمّان، وتتوزع قطاعات السكن ا، ب، ج على الاحياء الراقيه من العاصمه، وهي الواقعه في الجزء الغربي (عمان الغربيه) كالشميساني والمدينه الرياضيه وجبل عمّان وعبدون ودير غبار، وينتشر قطاعا السكن ج، د في المناطق الشرقيه (عمان الشرقيه) والجنوبيه الغربيه كجبل القصور والهاشمي والقلعه والجوفه وماركا والاشرفيه ونزال. حيث تحدد الامانه القطاع وفقا لعده عوامل عمرانيه وتخطيطيه.\nلقد تم تصنيف عمّان عام 2010، ضمن 14 مدينه عربيه كمدينه عالميه (او Global City)، وفقا لمجموعه دراسات العولمه والمدن العالميه GaWC، التي تتخذ من بريطانيا مقرا لها. حيث ياخذ التصنيف بعين الاعتبار: الخصائص الاقتصاديه (كمؤشرات سوق الاسهم / القيمه السوقيه، توفر الخدمات الماليه، اجمالي الناتج المحلي)، والخصائص السياسيه (كحجم المدينه من حيث عدد السكان او حجم التجمعات الحضريه، معايير جوده المعيشه ومدى تطور المدينه، المشاركه والتاثير في مناسبات دوليه)، والخصائص الثقافيه (كمدى شهره المدينه عالميا، تواجد المؤسسات الثقافيه، المرافق الرياضيه، المؤسسات التعليميه والجامعات، مواقع التراث العالمي، والمزارات الدينيه)، والبنيه التحتيه (كنظام النقل والمطارات، ووجود قاعده اتصالات حديثه مثل الالياف البصريه وخدمات الهاتف المحمول، والخدمات الصحيه كالمستشفيات). ويتم اختيار المدن وفقا لتطبيقها لهذه المعايير، او افتقادها لبعضها. حيث احتلت بموجبه عمّان مركزًا ضمن فئه +Gamma، من بين التصنيفات المتعدده للمدن في العالم.\n\nالهويه المعماريه\nيتميز البناء في عمّان عمومًا باستخدام الحجر كجزء اساسي يدعم واجهات البناء من جهاته الاربعه. وهذا لا ينحصر في جزء مُعيّن بالمدينه، ولكن تتميز عمان الغربيه بجمال العماره وجوده الخدمات وانتشار الفنادق من فئه الخمسه نجوم ومعظم الوزارات المنشاه على اسس ومقاييس متميزه في العماره والبناء. اضفت الحجاره المستخدمه في بناء مدينه عمان فناً تميزت به هذه المدينه واضفت على طابعها المعماري لمسه جماليه دفعت المهندسين الى ممارسه ابداعهم في تنوع كبير من اساليب العماره باستخدام الحجر.\nبحسب مجموعه من المهندسين المعماريين حملوا على انفسهم ان ينتجوا نماذج من فن العماره في عمّان، اكدوا تاثر العماره في الاردن بالموروث الحضاري لمدينه عمّان المعماري الاسلامي والروماني واليوناني. الا ان معظمهم اكد ان الفن الاسلامي هو غايه وامنيه بالنسبه لهم. ويعيب المهندسون على بعض الابنيه والتي يسمونها ابنيه التجميع والتي يحمل التصميم فيها سمات عماره الغرب المتزاوجه مع تصميمات المنطقه بدون الاخذ بعين الاعتبار الطابع المعماري الذي يميّز المنطقه وتاريخها والاعتبارات الثقافيه والحضاريه الاخرى. وبعضهم يصمم مبنى تحمل واجهاته اكثر من ثقافه وتراث اطلق عليه المهندسون «اسلوب الابهار» والخالي من المضمون والموروث والفاشل هندسيا وذكروا عددا من تلك النماذج في اماكن متعدده في عمان. لم ينكر المهندسون الحاجه احيانا الى ادخال بعض المواد العصريه للبناء مثل الزجاج والصفائح المعدنيه ضمن تصميم مدروس يراعي تطوير العماره العربيه مبينين ان هذا التداخل مطلوب ولا غبار عليه.\n\nان اساليب العماره في عمان عديده ولا يمكن حصرها. وقد تتعدد بتعدد الثقافات المعماريه التي حملها خريجو الهندسه الاردنيون من الشرق والغرب وعادوا بعد تخرجهم ليزرعوا ثمارها في جنبات المدينه وما حملوه من مذاهب معماريه متعدده. ويبدو انه كان لتنتشر نتيجه لذلك التشكيل المتعدد فوضى معماريه هائله لولا الاستعمال الموّحد للحجر الاردني في جميع هذه المباني. ادى هذا الى استعمال واسع لحجر البناء الذي توفر بصوره لبّت الحاجه لطبيعه عمّان الجغرافيه والطبوغرافيه كمدينه احيطت بعده جبال شكلت محاجرها رافدًا اساسيًا لتزويد المدينه بالحجاره. ولكن اتساع المدينه المطرد مع الزمن دفعها للبحث عن مصدر للحجاره من اماكن اخرى في المملكه ومن محافظات جنوب الاردن وخصوصا من محافظه معان.\n\nوسط المدينه الجديد\nتم البدء بمشروع العبدلي او مشروع تطوير منطقه العبدلي في عام 2005 وكان متوقعًا الانتهاء منه عام 2010. وسيصبح قلب عمّان الجديد ومركزها. يقوم المشروع على ارض مساحتها 804 كيلومترات مربعه، من مساحه مبنيه تزيد على 1,7 مليون امتار مربعه تضمّ مجمّعات سكنيه ومكاتب وفنادق وشقق مخدومه ومحلات تجاريه ومراكز للترفيه؛ وهو بذلك سيصبح محور الاعمال والسكن في العاصمه الاردنيه عمّان.\nلقد تم تطوير العبدلي ليكون مثابه مركز ذكي للمدينه حيث يجمع سويه البنيه التحتيه لوسائط الاعلام والاتصال، بما يكفل ايصال اكثر التقنيات تطورًا الى كل منزل ومكتب ومتجر، بينما تتوفر فيه حلول طاقه عامه وانظمه غاز مركزيه بما يضمن بيئه سليمه ووديه فضلاً عن التوفير الكبير في فاتوره الطاقه. وسيكون مركز المدينه مجهزًا كليًا بانظمه متطوره تقنيًا لاداره المباني وللحمايه من الحرائق ولاداره السلامه والتدابير الاحتياطيه. ساهم مشروع تطوير العبدلي في ايجاد شبكات طرق وحلول مروريه ممتازه حول المشروع وداخله، بما يؤمّن الانسيابيه لنحو 90,000 شخص يوميًا من السكان والعاملين والزوار عندما يعمل المشروع بكامل طاقته.\n\nدور العباده\nيُشكل المسلمون غالبيه سكان عمان حيث يشكلون ما نسبته 94%، ويشكل المسيحيون النسبه الباقيه اي ما نسبته 6% من السكان من مختلف الطوائف، ويكفل الدستور للجميع حريه ممارسه الاديان، ولذلك تجد في عمان مجموعه متنوعه من المساجد والكنائس موزعه في مختلف انحاء العاصمه اعتني في تصميمها وبناؤها لتتميز وتكمل نسيج المدينه المعماري. لقد تزايد عدد المساجد في الاردن بشكل لافت وملحوظ في الاونه الاخيره وبارقام قياسيه شهدت ارتفاعا كبيرا فاقت دول عربيه واسلاميه مجاوره. وبلغ عدد المساجد العامله في المملكه 6243 مسجدا - بلغت حصه عمّان منها 25%.\n\nيُلاحظ بشكل واضح ان تصميم معظم مساجد المدينه قد تم على الطرازين الاموي والفاطمي، نتيجه للطبيعه الجغرافيه التي حتّمت ان تكون عمّان جزءا من محيطها المعماري والحضاري الممتد من سوريا وفلسطين ولبنان حتى مصر.\nيُشار بالذكر الى ان المهاجرين المسلمين الشركس والشيشان قد ساهموا في بناء اول مساجد المدينه في العصر الحديث منذ نهايه القرن التاسع عشر. وتشهد المساجد الاثريه في مناطق تواجدهم - خاصه في وادي السير وراس العين ووسط البلد على هذا الامر.\nيُعد كل من مسجد ابو درويش، مسجد الملك عبد الله الاول، المسجد الحسيني، مسجد الملك الحسين، مسجد الشريعه، مسجد ابو قوره، مسجد الكالوتي، مسجد الروضه، ومسجد سيدو الكردي من اكبر مساجد المدينه واشهرها. اما بالنسبه للكنائس، فتوجد في عمّان العشرات منها والتي تخدم جميع الطوائف المسيحيه، ومن اهمها: كنيسه دخول السيد الى الهيكل في الصويفيه، كنيسه مطرانيه الروم الكاثوليك، كنيسه قصر البشارات، كنيسه الاقباط، كنيسه البشاره في اللويبده، كنيسه الاتحاد المسيحي الانجيليه في جبل عمّان، كنيسه الراعي الصالح الانجيليه اللوثريه في ام السماق، والكنائس المعمدانيه في الرابيه وابو نصير والشميساني وخلدا وصويلح وغيرها.\n\nالثقافه والفنون\nبدات البوادر الجاده لظهور حركه تشكيليه في عمّان في اوائل الخمسينات من القرن الفائت، ففي عام 1951 اقام «المنتدى العربي» اول معرض جماعي في الاردن. وبعده بسنه، تاسس معهد الموسيقى والرسم في المدينه. وفي اواخر الخمسينيات، ارسلت الحكومه اول مبعوثين اردنيين لدراسه الفن في الخارج، وهم: رفيق اللحام، ومهنا الدره، واحمد نعواش، وكمال بلاطه، والتحق بعضهم باكاديميه الفنون الجميله في روما. وفي عقد الستينيات بدا الموفدون بالعوده الى عمّان، وممارسه فنهم، وتدريس ماده الرسم في المدارس الثانويه، ومع عودتهم ازداد النشاط الفني، وكذلك اخذ عدد المعارض التي كانت تقام في القدس وعمان يتضاعف، والمحاضرات الفنيه كذلك، كما اخذت وزاره السياحه مبادره المشاركه باعمال الفنانين الاردنيين في المعارض الدوليه.\n\nفي عام 1966 تاسست دائره الثقافه والفنون، التابعه لوزاره الاعلام، وهدفها دعم الفنون التشكيليه والمسرحيه والموسيقى والادب وتشجيعها. ومع بدايه السبعينيات تضاعف النشاط الفني في المدينه، ففي عام 1972 اسست دائره الثقافه والفنون «معهد الفنون والموسيقى»، وقد اُريد له ان يكون نواه لاكاديميه فنيه، ومده الدراسه في المعهد سنتان، تعطى فيها دروس في الفن والتصوير والنحت وفن الطباعه والخزف، وقد تخرج منه عدد من الفنانين الاردنيين استطاع بعضهم اكمال دراسته الفنيه العليا في الخارج، معتمدين على التاسيس الذي حصلوا عليه في المعهد.\nلا شك ان الحركه التشكيليه الاردنيه تعتبر من انشط الحركات الفنيه في عمّان قياسا الى الحركه المسرحيه، او الموسيقيه مثلا، فقد شهدت فتره التسعينيات من القرن الماضي والسنوات الماضيه من الالفيه الجديده، نشاطا تشكيليا ملفتا للنظر، وقد تجلى هذا النشاط بغزاره اقامه المعارض الفنيه للفنانين الاردنيين والفنانين العرب والعالميين، وكان واضحا ان هناك ما يشبه الهجره للفنانين العراقيين بوجه خاص الى الاردن منذ بدايه التسعينيات اما للاقامه الدائمه، او المؤقته في طريقهم للخارج، وهذا انعكس حراكا فنيا واضحا على الساحه الاردنيه، وتواصلا بين الفنانين الاردنيين والعراقيين، وجد تعبيراته في ازدياد عدد المعارض الفنيه، وانشاء قاعات العرض الخاصه التي تزايدت اعدادها بشكل كبير، والتي تستقطب تجارب الفنانين الاردنيين والعرب والعالميين مما يشير الى تنامي الوعي الفني وانتشاره بين الجمهور، كما يؤشر الى ازدياد اعداد الفنانين الاردنيين، واقبال العديد من الطلبه على دراسه الفن التشكيلي، مما دفع الى فتح كليه للفنون الجميله في الجامعه الاردنيه في عمان في عام 2003 تدرس من ضمن تخصصاتها الرسم، الجرافيك والتصميم وغيرها من مفردات الفن التشكيلي وتخصصاته المختلفه الى جانب المسرح والموسيقى.\nاما بالنسبه للموسيقى، فكانت حاضره منذ اوائل القرن العشرين، خاصه ان هناك تداخل ما بين الثقافه البدويه والحضريه في المدينه. اما بالنسبه للموسيقى الكلاسيكيه، فهناك اوركسترا وطنيه تتخذ من عمان مقرا لها وهي اوركسترا عمان السيمفوني، التي ولدت من رحم اوركسترا المعهد الوطني للموسيقى (مؤسسه الملك الحسين) وبدعم من امانه عمان الكبرى. قدمت الاوركسترا باكوره حفلاتها في شهر كانون الثاني / يناير 2007. ويزخر الموسم الثقافي السنوي لاوركسترا عمان السمفوني ببرنامج منوع من الحفلات العامه، تقدم في ثالث اربعاء من كل شهر.\n\nعاصمه الثقافه العربيه والاسلاميه\nتشهد عمّان ازديادًا بالانشطه والمهرجانات المحليه والعربيه، وذلك منذ اعلانها عاصمه للثقافه العربيه عام 2002، يبرز من بينها اطلاق مشروع مسرح التراث الموسيقي الاردني، وافتتاح مشغل النحت العربي، ومهرجان عمان للافلام الوثائقيه، والمعرض الشامل للفن التشكيلي العربي، بالاضافه لافتتاح شارع الثقافه،\nمن جهه اخرى، فقد تم اعلان مدينه عمّان عام 2017 عاصمهً للثقافه الاسلاميه عن المنطقه العربيه.\nتنتشر في عمّان عدد كبير من المعارض ومراكز الفنون الجميله وعدّه اسواق شعبيه تعرض اسهامات الفنانين في وسط البلد وجبل عمان وجبل اللويبده، حيث شهدت هذه الاماكن حراكا ثقافيا نوعيّا في العقدين الاخيرين، زمن اشهر تلك المراكز؛ داره الفنون، دار الاندى، محترف رمال للفنون وكثير من المعارض الاخرى. ويجدر بالذكر الى ان وزاره الثقافه في الاردن قد تبنت مؤخرا تجربه المدن الثقافيه، او مايطلق عليه عاصمه الثقافه الاردنيه - كما حدث في اربد والسلط والكرك والزرقاء ومعان تباعا، مما اتاح قدر اكبر للانفتاح الثقافي والادبي على المدن الاردنيه الباقيه وعدم حصرها بالعاصمه، والتي سبق لها ان نالت لقب عاصمه الثقافه العربيه.\n\nوسط عمّان الثقافي\nتتضمن منطقه راس العين الكثير من المرافق الثقافيه التي تكمل دور امانه عمان الكبرى في احياءها ابتداءً من مسجد النورين وساحه النوافير وساحه النخيل ومن ثم قاعه المدينه ومبنى موظفي امانه عمان الكبرى وانتهاءً بمركز الحسين الثقافي، حيث تبلغ مساحه المشروع حوالي (20) دونماً من اصل مساحه الساحه البالغه (143) دونماً. وتتضمن هذه المساحه على مقر الامانه، متحف الاردن، مسرح مركز الحسين الثقافي، المعهد الوطني للموسيقى، بالاضافه الى سوق الحرف الشعبيه. وكان مُقررًا ايضًا ان يُنفذ مشروع دار للاوبرا في هذه المنطقه، هي داره الملك عبد الله الثاني للثقافه والفنون، الا انه توقف وتم تحويله الى سوق شعبي في عام 2014.\nتحوي عمّان على عدد لا باس به من المتاحف، مثل المتحف الوطني للفنون الجميله، متحف الازياء الشعبيه، متحف صرح الشهيد، متحف الحياه البرلمانيه، متحف الاثار الاردني، متحف الاطفال، متحف السيارات الملكي، القريه الثقافيه في حدائق الحسين، بالاضافه الى عدد كبير من المراكز الثقافيه الاجنبيه.\nيوجد في جبل عمان ايضًا، سوق مختص بالحرف اليدويه والثقافه الشعبيه، يُدعى سوق جارا، وهو سوق موسمي يبدا اسبوعيًا في كل يوم جمعه خلال شهر ايار/مايو، وينتهي في شهر تشرين الاول/اكتوبر. تُقيمه سنويا رابطه سكان جبل عمان. يرتاده السياح بكثره خلال فصل الصيف.\nمن الجدير بالذكر الى ان المدينه تستضيف كل عام مهرجانات ثقافيه عالميه ومحليه؛ من اهمها معرض الكتاب العالمي، مهرجان ايام عمان المسرحيه، مهرجان الاردن، مهرجان الموسيقى والغناء الصوفي، مهرجان صيف عمان، مهرجان عمان للرقص المعاصر ومهرجان عمان للكوميديا، وغيرها.\n\nالاعلام\nمعظم الصحف الاردنيه الكبرى ومراكز البث موجوده في عمّان. كما تُشكل المدينه مركزا اعلاميًا للصحفيين الدوليين الاتين لتغطيه اخبار المنطقه المتجدده سواء في فلسطين، العراق وسوريا، او في مناطق قريبه اخرى.\nتاسست في عمّان عام 1969 وكاله الانباء الاردنيه، وهي وكاله الانباء الرسميه في الاردن. كما تاسست المدينه الاعلاميه الاردنيه في عام 2001، وهي الاولى من نوعها في منطقه بلاد الشام، والتي يُؤمل منها ان تجعل من عمّان محورا رئيسيا لشبكات البث الفضائي. يوجد الانالكثير من المحطات التي ترسل بثها منها. تحاول عمّان اليوم منافسه مدن اخرى ذات الخبره والامكانيات في مجال الاعلام مثل بيروت ودبي والقاهره. وقد تاسس في 2003 الهيئه الملكيه الاردنيه للافلام، وهي مؤسسه تقدم الدعم لانتاج الافلام والمسلسلات التلفزيونيه في الاردن وتدريب الناشئه وصانعي الافلام والمهنيين من الاردن والمنطقه في جميع مجالات السينما والانتاج التلفزيوني. تقدم الهيئه برامج وورش تدريبيه على مدار السنه، من اجل بناء صناعه افلام حديثه ورائده ذات مستوى عالمي في الاردن، بحيث يتمكن جميع صانعي الافلام في الشرق الاوسط انتاج افلام بحريه جنباً الى جنب اكثر فناني العالم موهبه.\n\nالاقتصاد\nكانت الليره العثمانيه هي العمله المتداوله في عمّان اثناء الحكم العثماني. استمر ذلك حتى اُنشئت اماره شرق الاردن تحت وصايه الانتداب البريطاني، فتم استخدام الجنيه المصري بشكل مؤقت الى ان اصدر الجنيه الفلسطيني عام 1927 حيث اعتمد في الدوله واستخدم حتى مطلع الخمسينيات من القرن الماضي، عندما صدر الدينار الاردني وصار هو العمله الرسميه. كما يُستخدم الدولار الامريكي واليورو الى جانب الدينار في عمليات البيع والشراء. ما زال سكان عمّان يستخدمون كلمه الليره رغم تعاملهم بالدينار نتيجه للتاثر الطويل بالعثمانيين الذين حكموا بلاد الشام قرابه 4 قرون.\n\nتُعتبر عمّان اليوم مركزًا للحياه الاقتصاديه في الاردن، الذي انتعش اقتصاده برجوع رؤوس الاموال والمستثمرين من الكويت والخليج سنه 1990 حيث بدات خطط التنميه تلقى طريقها في المدينه من انشاء مشاريع كثيره. ويعتمد اقتصاد المدينه على قطاعات البناء والبنوك والتامين والتجاره وبشكل كبير على قطاع السياحه والفندقه، بالاضافه للصناعات الغذائيه والخفيفه والمتوسطه. تتخذ كبرى الشركات الاردنيه وعدد من الشركات الاقليميه والعالميه في المنطقه من المدينه مقرا لها. كذلك يمتلك العديد من مواطني دول الخليج العربي وكبار اثرياء العرب عقارات واعمال في عمّان الغربيه. في العقدين الاخيرين قامت العديد من الشركات الخليجيه والعربيه والعالميه بالاستثمار في عمّان تتصدرها الشركات الكويتيه.\nاحتلت عمّان في عام 2007 المرتبه الاولى بين المدن العربيه من حيث غلاء المعيشه فيها - حسب «مجله الايكونومست البريطانيه». حيث ان ارتفاع اسعار المساكن والعقارات والاراضي، الى جانب ارتفاع اسعار النفط الذي اثر على كلف الانتاج وزياده قيمه المستوردات، عوامل ساهمت في تربع عمّان على صداره قائمه اغلى المدن عربيا.\n\nبورصه عمان وغرفه تجاره عمّان\nتاسست بورصه عمان في عام 1999 كمؤسسه مستقله تُدار من قبل القطاع الخاص لمزاوله العمل كسوق منظم لتداول الاوراق الماليه في المملكه. تقوم البورصه بتوفير انظمه الكترونيه ووسائل ربط وقاعات مجهزه بالادوات والوسائل التقنيه الحديثه. ومراقبه عمليات التداول في السوق والتنسيق مع الهيئه في متابعه تلك العمليات. كما قامت بوضع معايير للسلوك المهني لضمان التزام اعضائها بمبادئ التداول السليم، كما تحرص على ضروره النشر الفوري والصحيح للمعلومات لجميع المهتمين بنفس الوقت. اما غرفه تجاره عمّان تتكون من 12 عضوا منتخبين عن طريق الاقتراع الحر والمباشر من قبل اعضاء الهيئه العامه للغرفه البالغ عددهم حوالي 35,000 عضو، ومده عضويه المجلس 4 سنوات، وتهدف الغرفه الى قياده القطاع التجاري نحو مستقبل افضل للاعمال واقتصاد وطني حر.\n\nالاسواق\nازدهرت حركه التجاره في عمان منذ القدم، ففيها عده اسواق قديمه، وهي كالاتي: سوق السكر، وسوق البخاريه، وسوق الجمعه، وسوق وادي السرور، وسوق الخضار، وسوق اليمنيه، وسوق الحبوب، وسوق الحلال، وسوق الصاغه، وسوق السعاده، وسوق الانتيكا، وسوق البناء الحديث. بالنسبه الى سوق البخاريه القديم، الذي نسج خيوط الحكايه لشيخ من بخاري قدم الى عمان كغيره من التجار فاسس هذا السوق القديم في ساحه شرقي المسجد الحسيني الحالي عام 1934 وبقي السوق في موقعه الى عام 1954 وبعدها نقل الى عماره فوزي المفتي في شارع الملك طلال مقابل المسجد الحسيني تتوزع عشرات المحلات التجاريه حسب نوعيه البضائع التي يبيعها السوق. ويمكن تصنيفها الى محال لبيع ادوات ومستلزمات الحلاقين، وادوات ومستلزمات الخياطه والتطريز، ومستلزمات مشاغل الخياطه والكلف، وهناك محال لبيع الاكسسوارات والمنسوجات والعطاره، ومحال لبيع العطور والبخورات.\nوعلى الرغم من هذا التنوع التجاري لواقع العاصمه عمان بين الاسواق القديمه والمولات الحديثه والتي تختلف في الشكل والمحتوى تبقى ظاهره انتشار البسطات بمختلف انواعها ومحتوياتها موجوده في شوارع الاسواق داخل عمان.\nومن اكبر مراكز التسوق الحديثه في المدينه، ستي مول، مكه مول، تاج مول، عمّان مول، غاليريا مول.\n\nالصناعه\nاتبعت امانه عمان الكبرى بالتعاون مع وزاره الصناعه والتجاره المعايير في تحديد المناطق الصناعيه. وعليه قامت امانه عمان الكبرى باجراء دراسه مكثفه وتحليل لخيارات المواقع الملائمه لتاهيلها لتكون المناطق الصناعيه كالتالي:\n\nمنطقه سحاب – وممر الموقر: تمّ تصنيف هذه المنطقه كمنطقه صناعات خفيفه ومتوسطه مع الاخذ بعين الاعتبار الصناعات القائمه حاليا في هذه المنطقه وتوفير بعد جغرافي عن المناطق السكنيه في منطقه الموقر والنقيره.\nمنطقه القسطل الصناعيه: مع الاخذ بعين الاعتبار الوضع الصناعي الحالي في منطقه القسطل ياتي تحديد هذه المنطقه جنوب شرق طريق المطار حيث تم تصنيف هذه المنطقه للصناعات المتخصصه كصناعات الابحاث والاعمال والتقنيات. اما بقيه الاراضي في هذه المنطقه فقد تم تصنيفها صناعات خفيفه ومتوسطه لتكون مسانده للصناعات المتخصصه في نفس المنطقه وايضا تسمح هذه المنطقه بتوفير مناطق جغرافيه واسعه للمد الصناعي.\nمنطقه الجيزه الصناعيه: تمّ تحديد المنطقه جنوبي الجيزه كمنطقه صناعات متوسطه وخفيفه مع الاخذ بعين الاعتبار الصناعات القائمه حاليا في تلك المنطقه. حيث ستكون هذه المنطقه منطقه جذب للعماله بسبب المشاريع السكنيه التي ستقام بالقرب منها، كمشروع تعمير للاسكان.\nهذا وتوجد عده مناطق صناعيه، تحوي على عدد من الوكالات وكثير من محلات تصليح السيارات، متوزعه على اطراف العاصمه، كما في البيادر الى الجنوب الغربي، وصافوط الى الشمال الغربي، وماركا الى الشمال الشرقي، ووادي الرمم الى الشرق، والوحدات الى الجنوب من المدينه.\n\nالزراعه\nاشتهرت مدينه عمان بانتمائها الى منطقه خصبه وافره الغلال، فقد وصفتها المصادر القديمه ومنها التوراه بكثره المياه «مدينه المياه»، كما ان الجغرافيين والمؤرخين العرب نعتوا منطقه عمان بالخصب والنماء وكثره الغلات. ومما اشتهرت به عمان: الحبوب الكثيره خصوصاً القمح، فوصفت بانها معدن الحبوب، حتى ضرب المثل بجوده حنطتها، وقد راينا انها والصلت كانت تزود القدس وبعض المدن الفلسطينيه بالقمح بعدما حررها صلاح الدين من الصليبيين، فاشترط صلاح الدين على اخيه - التي كانت ضمن اقطاعه بان يرسل القمح ففعل.\nواشتهرت عمان ايضا بالخراف الجيده السمينه والعسل اللذيذ وانتشرت حولها كروم الاعناب العديد التي استخرجوا منها الخمور وعملوا منها الزبيب، وكذلك اشجار التين الكثيره ومنها عملوا القطين، التين المجفف، كما اشتهرت بالفواكه الكثيره واشجار البطم وغيره.\nوقد وصفت منطقه البلقاء في العصور الوسطى بانها ذات قرى ومزارع وارضها زكيه طيبه حتى ان قراها بلغت نيفاً وثلاثمائه قريه، اما مزارعها فهي واسعه منتشره نذكر منها مزرعه لابي سفيان زعيم قريش، واخرى ليوسف بن عمرو والي العراق. كذلك اشتهرت جاديه احدى قرى البلقاء بزراعه الزعفران - الورس- وكانت له اهميته اذ ذاك لاستعماله في الصباغه وصدر للخارج لان الاوروبيين كانوا يستعملونه كدواء ايضاً. كما صدرت عمان نبات الرواند، وهو عباره عن عروق خشبيه مستديره في غلظ الاصابع وسمي الروابد الشامي او رواند الدواب لان البياطره يسقونه للدواب اذا احترت اكبادها. وهو غير الرواند الصيني الذي يشبه القلقاس ويستعمل في علاج الانسان، كاوجاع الكبد والكلى والمغص.\nاما نهرها الصغير الذي ذكره الجغرافيون، فقد اقيمت عليه في العصور المختلفه الحمامات لخدمه سكانها، وفي خارجها اقيمت عليه الارحيه لطحن الدقيق وكانت هذه الرحيه تخدم سكان القرى المجاوره فيقصدون عمان من اجل طحن دقيقهم هذا بالاضافه الى الزراعات والخضر المختلفه التي تقوم على ضفافه لخدمه سكان المدينه العريقه.\n\nالسياحه\nتشهد عمّان في فصل الصيف ازديادًا كبيرًا في عدد السيّاح، وخصوصًا من الدول العربيه. حيث يساعد المناخ المتوسطي المعتدل في جذب هذه الفئه، بالاضافه الى اقامه العديد من المهرجانات الثقافيه والنشاطات الفنيه المختلفه. ويوجد عدد لاباس به من الاماكن لزيارتها في المدينه كالمناطق السياحيه والمصايف واماكن الترفيه، بالاضافه الى المواقع التاريخيه الهامه التي تحكي قصه المدينه، واهمها المدرج الروماني وقلعه عمّان ورجم الملفوف العمّوني. كما تحوي المدينه الكثير من المطاعم والمقاهي التي تقدم الاطعمه الشرقيه والغربيه خاصه تلك التي تقع في اطراف العاصمه وخارجها وسط الغابات والاشجار الحرجيه كجبال عجلون ودبين ومرتفعات الرمان وتحتوي معظم هذه المطاعم والمتنزهات على ملاعب للاطفال او برك للسباحه مما يجعلها متعه حقيقيه لجميع افراد الاسره. وتنتشر في عمان والمدن الاردنيه الاخرى اسواق الحرف والصناعه التقليديه من المنسوجات والمطرزات والازياء والحلي والمجوهرات والخزفيات والزجاج كما تتوفر مراكز التسوق الكبيره التي تحتوي على المحلات التجاريه المتعدده وتعرض الملابس الحديثه لدور الازياء العالميه.\n\nيقع في عمّان الكثير من النوادي الرياضيه المتخصصه كنوادي ركوب الخيل والسباحه والنوادي الصحيه التي يستطيع الزائر قضاء وقت مفيد وممتع فيها كما تقام اثناء فصل الصيف نواد صيفيه متعدده الغايات المغامرات والغطس والسباحه والكمبيوتر يشارك فيها الاطفال والشباب العرب الزوار الى جانب الاردنيين لممارسه رياضاتهم المختلفه. كما تنتشر المدن الترويحيه والمتنزهات والحدائق العامه وصالات العاب تسليه الاطفال.\nمن اهم المناطق التي يرتادها السياح، مناطق شارع الثقافه وعبدون وشارع الوكالات وسوق الصويفيه وسوق الرابيه وشارع مكه وشارع المدينه المنوره وشارع الجامعه الاردنيه وسوق جبل اللويبده وشارع الرينبو وسوق جبل الحسين وسوق ام اذينه، ومناطق وسط البلد بطبيعه الحال. وتحوي هذه المناطق على جمله من المطاعم والمقاهي المتنوعه ذات الطابع الشرقي والغربي، فبالاضافه للمطاعم الاردنيه، يمكن للسائح ان يرى العديد من المطاعم اللبنانيه والايطاليه والفرنسيه والتركيه والصينيه والهنديه ومطاعم الوجبات السريعه الامريكيه ومطاعم عراقيه ويمنيه وخليجيه اخرى.\nشهدت عمّان في 9 تشرين الثاني/ نوفمبر 2005 فيما يعرف شعبيًا بيوم «الاربعاء الاسود» الذي مثّل ضربه عنيفه للسياحه في المدينه والبلاد بشكل عام، حيث ادت عده عمليات انتحاريه ارهابيه الى تفجير بتفجير ثلاثه من فنادقها، قُتل فيها ثلاثه من المهاجمين والقي القبض على الرابع وهي سيده. اودت الانفجارات بحياه 65 من المدنيين، ومنهم المخرج السوري مصطفى العقاد وابنته، واصابه الكثيرين بجروج، مما اثر الى حد كبير على سكانها ووفود السياح اليها ولكنها بتشديد الامن واتخاذ الاجراءات المناسبه سرعان ما استعادت وضعها السابق حيث اخذت تستقبل الزائرين طوال العام وخاصه في فصل الصيف عند عوده المغتربين وزياره السائحين والمصطافين وزياده الفعاليات الترفيهيه والثقافيه كمهرجان جرش سابقا ومهرجان الاردن حاليا ومهرجان صيف عمان.\n\nالفنادق\nيوجد في عمّان ما لا يقل عن 36 فندق من فئه الاربعه والخمسه نجوم معظمها انشئ في عمان الغربيه، والعديد منها يتبع سلسله فنادق عالميه مثل فندق انتركونتيننتال الاردن والفور سيزنز والميريديان والغراند حياه والراديسون ساس والشيراتون. ويتميز فندق الرويال في عمّان بعمارته الفريده، اذ يظهر في افق المدينه وكانه قلعه تعلو جبل عمان.\n\nالمعالم الاثريه\nوتتمتع عمّان بثروه من المعالم الاثريه الشهيره ما زالت شاهده على حضارات قديمه استوطنت المدينه، فعلى جبل القلعه الذي يعلو المدينه القديمه يرتفع «هيكل هرقل» الذي بناه الرومان في القرن الثاني الميلادي على بقايا معبد عموني قديم، الى جانب متحف الاثار الذي يحتوي على معروضات عديده من مختلف الحضارات وادوات تمثل حياه الانسان في هذه العهود القديمه. وفي وسط المدينه يقع سبيل الحوريات، وعلى مقربه من السبيل ينتصب المدرج الروماني الكبير الذي يتسع لخمسه الاف متفرج، وغيرها من المعالم التي تُستغل حتى اليوم في فعاليات ثقافيه وفنيه عديده، وهي من المراكز التي يستغلها مهرجان الاردن وينظم فيها فعالياته:\n\nمنتزهات واماكن ترفيهيه ورياضيه\nرُوعي في التخطيط المدني للمدينه تنوّع الاماكن الترفيهيه في نوعيتها واماكن وجودها، وهناك محاولات حثيثه لزيادتها. ومعظم الجديد منها ينشا على اطراف المدينه على جانبي الطريق الدائري لتسهيل الوصول اليها.\n\nالسياحه الطبيه\nتصل عوائد السياحه الطبيه الى 700 مليون دولار امريكي في العام، حسب تصريحات البنك الدولي فالاردن هي الاولى في المنطقه والخامسه على مستوى العالم في هذا المجال. هناك عدد من المستشفيات الحكوميه والخاصه في عمّان، التي يرتادها المرضى العرب من دول الخليج العربي والعراق واليمن ودول المغرب العربي. وان ما يجذب المرضى هو اجراءات تخفيض الاسعار والجوده العاليه عن العلاج في اوروبا والولايات المتحده الامريكيه. والساحه الطبيه في عمّان تتميز بمهاره وخبره متميزه في مجال امراض وجراحه القلب وكذلك تطبيق الكثير من الجراحات الدقيقه فيما يخص العيون والكلى والرئتين.\n\nالصحه\nالمستشفيات\nشهدت عمّان مع تاسيس اماره شرق الاردن في بدايه العشرينات من القرن العشرين، نهضه طبيه تمثلت بتاسيس عدد من المستشفيات الحكوميه، التي كان اولها مستشفى البلديه ثم المستشفى الحكومي عام 1926. ثم تلى تلك الفتره تاسيس المستشفيات الخاصه، كان اولها مستشفى ملحس في جبل عمّان، وتحديًدا عام 1944. وظلت عمّان تطور من بنيتها التحتيه الطبيه خلال العقود اللاحقه، حيث تم تشييد مدينه الحسين الطبيه عام 1973، والتي تُعد اول مدينه طبيه عربيه.\nكما شهدت الخدمات الصحيه في فتره التسعينات، توسعًا كميًا ونوعيًا على كافه الاصعده والقطاعات الطبيه العامله في هذا المجال الحكومي منه والقطاع الخاص. فقد شهد القطاع الخاص بعد عام 1990 نموًا مضطردًا في عدد المستشفيات كان اهمها المستشفى التخصصي ومستشفى الاردن ومستشفى الاستقلال ومستشفى الاسراء ومستشفى الامير حمزه، وغيرها الكثير من المستشفيات التي حصلت على الاعتماديه الدوليه من منظمه الصحه العالميه.\nغير ان اهم تلك الانجازات تمثل بتشييد مركز عالمي متخصص بمعالجه مرض السرطان، هو مركز الحسين للسرطان، الذي تم تاسيسه عام 1997، ليكون اول مركز متخصص في علاج السرطان يحصل على الاعتماد الخاص بامراض السرطان خارج الولايات المتحده الاميركيه.\n\nالجدول التالي يظهر اهم المستشفيات الموجوده في عمّان:\n\nالتعليم والتعليم العالي\nتعود بدايات التعليم في مدينه عمّان الى فتره الحرب العالميه الاولى، وتحديدا عام 1916، عند افتتاح مدرسه دار النجاح، والتي كان موقعها خلف المسجد الحسيني الكبير، كان التعليم في المدرسه باللغه التركيه ما عدا درس الدين الذي كان يدرس باللغه العربيه، وكان يطلق على المدرسه اسم اخر اكثر استعمالا وشيوعا وهو «المكتب الحربي» لان الخريجين كانوا يتاهلون للالتحاق بالكليه الحربيه في الاستانيه - اسطنبول.\nشهدت المدينه خلال حقبه الخمسينات والستينات من القرن الفائت طفره نوعيه في مجال التعليم ومن ثم التعليم العالي، بتاسيس الجامعه الاردنيه. كما ان هذه الطفره قد زادت بشكل ملحوظ في عقدي الثمانينات والتسعينات، وقد شهد قطاع التعليم الخاص ازدهارا ملحوظا حيث كانت عمّان هي السباقه فيه في منطقه الشرق الاوسط.\n\nكليات ومدارس\nفي يوليو / تموز 2003، اطلقت الحكومه الاردنيه برنامجا طموحا في منطقه الشرق الاوسط وشمال افريقيا كلها، وهو برنامج اصلاح التعليم من اجل الاقتصاد القائم على المعرفه وهو برنامج متعدد المانحين مدته عشر سنوات، وقدم البنك الدولي لهذا البرنامج 120 مليون دولار امريكي. وسعى البرنامج الى اعاده توجيه السياسات والبرامج التعليميه بما يتماشى مع حاجات اقتصاد قائم على المعرفه، وتحسين بيئه التعليم الماديه في معظم المدارس، وتشجيع التعليم في سنوات الطفوله المبكره. وامتدت المرحله الاولى للبرنامج من 2003 الى 2009 واختتمت في يونيو/حزيران 2009.\nوالمدارس في عمّان اما عامه او خاصه. ويخدم قطاع التعليم الخاص اكثر من 31.14 في المائه من الطلبه في عمان. ولا يزال هذا القطاع يتحمل ضرائب باهظه تصل الى 25 في المائه، مع انه يتحمل عبئا كبيرا عن كاهل حكومه المملكه، الامر الذي يجعل الرسوم الدراسيه مرتفعه نسبيا، اذ تبدا من 1000 دولار وتصل الى 7000 دولار، وتعتبر قيمه رسوم التعليم الخاص مرتفعه للغايه عند مقارنتها بدخل الاسر في المتوسط.\nمن اشهر مدارس المدينه؛ الكليه العلميه الاسلاميه، مدارس المطران، مدرسه الفرير، مدرسه راهبات الورديه، كليه الحسين، مدرسه راهبات الناصره، المدارس العمريه، مدرسه اليوبيل، مدرسه البطريركيه اللاتينيه وغيرها الكثير.\nيشار بالذكر الى انه مبادره التعليم في الاردن قد حصلت في الاونه الاخيره على جائزه اليونسكو لاستخدام تكنولوجيا المعلومات والاتصالات في التعليم. ويستند هذا المشروع التعليمي الرائد في مدارس الاردن على الاستفاده من قوه المعلومات والتكنولوجيا من خلال طرق تدريس مجربه لتغيير بيئه التعلم في المدارس.\nبالاضافه الى ذلك توجد العديد من الكليّات الخاصه والمعاهد التي تمنح شهادات الدبلوم في معظم التخصصات:\nمثل كليه القدس، الاكاديميه العربيه للعلوم الماليه والمصرفيه، كليه طلال ابوغزاله لاداره الاعمال، الكليه الجامعيه المتوسطه والاكاديميه الملكيه للطيران وكليات اخرى.\n\nجامعات\nبالنسبه للتعليم العالي، او الجامعي، فتشمل عمّان عدد كبير من الجامعات قياسا لعدد السكان بالمدينه سواء على المستوى الخاص او الحكومي، مثل الجامعه الاردنيه، جامعه العلوم التطبيقيه، جامعه البتراء، الجامعه الالمانيه الاردنيه، جامعه الاميره سميه للتكنولوجيا، جامعه الزيتونه، جامعه الاسراء، جامعه العلوم الاسلاميه العالميه، جامعه الشرق الاوسط، بعض كليات جامعه البلقاء التطبيقيه، وجامعات اخرى.\nيُقبل الحائزين على شهاده الثانويه العامه في الجامعات الحكوميه او الخاصه او الكليّات. تطبق معظم الجامعات في عمّان والاردن بشكل عام النموذج الامريكي الجامعي القائم على نظام الساعات (بالانجليزيه: Credit Hours) الذي يمنح الطلبه المرونه لاختيار عدد الساعات واوقات الدوام الصباحي او المسائي. هنالك جامعتان حكوميتان مرتبطه بجامعات في الولايات المتحده والمملكه المتحده. هنالك ايضا اكثر من 5 جامعات خاصه مُعترف بها على مستوى الدول العربيه، وبعض الجامعات الاجنبيه كجامعه نيويورك والجامعه الالمانيه الاردنيه. تستقطب الجامعات الاردنيه في عمّان وغيرها من المدن الاردنيه كل عام عدد كبير من الطلبه الاجانب العرب وغير العرب.\n\nالبحث العلمي\nلدى الاردن اكبر عدد من الباحثين في مجال البحوث والتطوير لكل مليون شخص بين كل البلدان السبعه والخمسين الاعضاء في منظمه التعاون الاسلامي (OIC) وهو من اعلى المعدلات في العالم حيث يوجد في الاردن 8060 باحث لكل مليون شخص، بينما المتوسط العالمي يبلغ 2532، والمتوسط في الاتحاد الاوروبي يبلغ 6494، في حين ان المتوسط في البلدان الاعضاء في منظمه التعاون الاسلامي يبلغ 649 باحث لكل مليون شخص.\nوتحوي عمّان على كثير من المراكز العريقه في مجال البحث العلمي بجميع فروعه، ومن اهم تلك المراكز؛ الجمعيه العلميه الملكيه (المؤسسه عام 1970)، التي تهدف الى تطوير التعاون العلمي والتكنولوجي مع مؤسسات مماثله في جميع انحاء العالم.\nكذلك بالنسبه للمركز الجغرافي الملكي الاردني، حيث يعتبر هذا المركز (المؤسس عام 1975) من المراكز المتقدمه على الصعيدين الاقليمي والدولي في مجال العلوم المساحيه وانتاج الخرائط والدراسات والابحاث التطبيقيه المستنده الى معطيات الصور الفضائيه والجويه. عمل المركز منذ انشائه على توفير الكفاءات المدربه في مجال المساحه والخرائط وما يتعلق بهما من علوم كالاستشعار عن بعد والخرائط الرقميه والجيوديزيا الفضائيه، وتم ذلك من خلال التاهيل خارج المملكه في الدول المتقدمه، وداخل المملكه في كليه المركز الجغرافي الملكي الاردني للعلوم المساحيه، والتي لم يقتصر التدريب فيها على الاردنيين، بل شمل العديد من ابناء الدول العربيه الاخرى.\nكما ان هناك كثير من الجمعيات والمراكز الاخرى المهتمه بمجالات مختلفه، منها الطب والطاقه والهندسه والفنون وغيرها.\n\nالرياضه\nتعد عمّان من اكثر المدن العربيه في اسيا اهتماما بالشباب والرياضه بشكل عام، ويتجلى ذلك في عدد المجمعات والمدن الرياضيه المخصصه للشباب، مما اثر ايجابا على مشاركات الاردن في بطولات عربيه واقليميه ودوليه كثيره وخاصه على مستوى كره القدم وكره السله، اللتان تلقيا اقبالا واهتماما كبيرا من قبل الشباب الاردني. كذلك العاب الدفاع عن النفس والسباحه وكره التنس واليد والفروسيه كلها العاب يقبل عليها الشباب في هذه المدينه بشغف. كما ساهم المجلس الاعلى للشباب بتنميه قدرات الشباب من جميع النواحي الحياتيه عن طريق نشر مراكز الشباب في مختلف محافظات المملكه.\nمن اكثر الانديه شعبيه بين الجمهور العمّاني على مستوى كره القدم، هي انديه الوحدات (يتخد من ستاد القويسمه الدولي في الوحدات مقرا له) والفيصلي (يتخد من ستاد عمان الدولي مقرا له) بالاضافه الى انديه اخرى مثل نادي البقعه. كما يلقى نادي زين والنادي الارثوذكسي ونادي التطبيقيه ونادي الارينا... الخ اهتماما كبير من قبل الجمهور ومشجعي كره السله الاردنيه.\n\nالمدينه الرياضيه\nكان هناك استشعار للقياده الاردنيه منذ منتصف الستينات في القرن الفائت، بحاجه الشباب الاردني لانشاء مركز ريادي يخدم الشباب في كافه المجالات لابراز قدراتهم وابداعاتهم ومواكبه التقدم والتطور مما يعكس صوره مشرقه عن الاردن وشعبه، فتبلورت فكره انشاء مدينه للشباب التي اصبحت رائده المدن الرياضيه في الشرق الاوسط. تقع المدينه الرياضيه او مدينه الحسين للشباب في قلب العاصمه عمان، وتمتد على قطعه ارض تبلغ مساحتها حوالي 1200 دونم تغطي الاشجار ثلث مساحتها، بينما تحتل المنشات الرياضيه والملاعب والحدائق العامه والمواقف باقي مساحتها. تم البدء بانشاء المدينه عام 1964 واستغرق ذلك حوالي اربع سنوات.\n\nمشاكل\nالغلاء\nتعاني مدينه عمّان من الارتفاع المستمر في الاسعار، اذ تصدرت اغلى مدن الشرق الاوسط وشمال افريقيا من ناحيه التكلفه المعيشيه وفقًا لمجله الايكونومست البريطانيه ـ في عاميّ 2007 و 2015. واشار التقرير الى ان العاصمه الاردنيه تقدمت اربع مراتب في لائحه المدن الاغلى بالكلفه المعيشيه لتحتل المرتبه الـ48 عالميًا للعام 2015، من المرتبه 52 للعام 2014، لتصبح بذلك ضمن قائمه اغلى خمسين مدينه على مستوى العالم، من بين 133 مدينه شملها التقرير.\n\nالعشوائيات\nادّت الزياده غير المتوقعه في عدد السكان في المدينه نتيجه الحروب المتلاحقه في المنطقه، الى عدم تبنّي المخطط الشمولي الذي تم وضعه عام 1956، والذي يُعتبر اول مخطط هيكلي لعمّان بمعناه الصحيح، والذي حدد شكل المدينه ووظائفها والاستعمالات المختلفه وخطوط النقل والمواصلات وغيرها من الخصائص العامه. تعاني معظم احياء مدينه عمّان اليوم من النمو العشوائي حتى في الاحياء الراقيه، بالرغم من تصنيفها الى مناطق ا، ب، ج،... الخ بناءً على عوامل عمرانيه وتنظيميه خاصه بقوانين امانه عمان الكبرى. حيث ان تقسيمات الكثير من قطع الاراضي عشوائيه ومتداخله. كذلك ينتشر عدد ليس بقليل من الاسكانات بشكل غير مدروس، حيث انها تتمدد باتجاهات غير منظمه مما يؤدي الى عشوائيه في الخدمات حيث يسكن السكان. بالاضافه الى ضئاله المناطق الخضراء بالنسبه للمباني، وما تبقّى منها يتاكل بسرعه لتحل محله الاسكانات. اما الحدائق العامه فهي محدوده للغايه.\nعلى الرغم من ذلك، قد بدات عمّان مؤخرًا بالتوسع بشكل مدروس لم تشهده المدينه من قبل، حيث نالت خطه مدينه عمان الشموليه جوائز عالميه، منها جائزه القياده العالميه في تخطيط المدن وجائزه المدينه عن قاره اسيا لعام 2007.\n\nالازمه المروريه\nادت الظروف السياسيه المتلاحقه بالمنطقه وتبعاتها المتمثله بموجات اللجوء من المناطق المجاوره للاردن بشكل كبير وفجائي عبر العقود الماضيه، بالاضافه الى عوده الاف المغتربين في الخارج، الى ازدياد عدد سكان المدينه بشكل كبير وغير مدروس، والذي اثر بدوره على شبكه الطرق المتواضعه اصلاً. حيث تعاني المدينه من انعدام التخطيط المستقبلي لشوارعها التي لم يُراعى في انشاءها هذا العدد الكبير من المستخدمين. فالطرق في عمّان في معظمها غير قابله للتوسعه لاستيعاب الكم المتزايد للمركبات، بالاضافه الى التلكؤ الحكومي في ايجاد حلول جذريه للمشكله.\nمن جانب اخر، تُعد عمّان من اقل مدن العالم استخدامًا لوسائل النقل العام، حيث لا يستخدم هذه الوسائل سوى 14% (2010) من العدد الاجمالي للسكان في المدينه. وقد اشارت اخر الاحصائيات الى ان هناك اكثر من مليون سياره تسير في عمّان، معظمها لنقل شخص واحد. ونتيجه لهذه المشاكل، تحاول الحكومه في ايجاد حلول بديله عن استخدام المركبات، حيث يُعد مشروع الباص السريع اهمها. فيما اعلنت عن خطط على المدى البعيد تتمثل بانشاء خطوط للترام او المترو بموازاه الباص السريع الذي يُعد حل ضروري واني بسبب الاختناق المروري الذي تعاني منه المدينه، وخصوصًا صيفًا.\n\nسوء توزيع الخدمات\nتعاني عمّان كمعظم المدن العربيه بتعدد الانماط الحياتيه والعمرانيه بين احياءها القديمه والحديثه. لكن المختلف في عمّان يرتبط بنشاتها واصلها القروي وطابعها الريفي. فالجزء الشرقي من المدينه هو الجزء الاقدم والاكثر كثافه بالسكان، يعاني بشكل عام وواضح من سوء توزيع الخدمات وقله تواجد المؤسسات الحكوميه الكبرى، التي تتركز معظمها في الجزء الغربي.\nبالاضافه الى ذلك، فان النمط العمراني في عمّان الشرقيه يتسم بتراص الابنيه السكنيه المبنيه على الاغلب من الطوب. بينما الابراج التي تضم كبرى الشركات والفنادق والمجمعات التجاريه باتت تحتل مساحات كبيره من عمان الغربيه التي يتميز البناء فيها بانه مكسي بالحجر الكلسي.\nولا ينتهي الامر عند خصائص العمران والمستوى الاجتماعي والمعيشي للسكان، بل يتعداه الى التخطيط المدني والهندسي، فالشوارع والارصفه في شرق عمّان بشكل عام ضيقه وقليله الصيانه بعكس الكثير من شوارع عمّان الغربيه. كما ان مستوى النظافه في غرب عمّان يظهر بشكل واضح عند المقارنه مع احياء المدينه القديمه التي تتكدس الاوساخ على جوانب شوارعها وحاوياتها، بالاضافه الى مشاكل الصرف الصحي.\nمن جهه اخرى، تعاني معظم احياء عمّان الشرقيه من التهميش الثقافي وندره في النشاطات الاجتماعيه الموجوده في عمّان الغربيه. بالاضافه الى التهميش الاجتماعي، حيث يُلاحظ بشكل كبير ان عمان مقسومه الى شطرين، يقع الشطر الاول في الناحيه الغربيه واغلب سكانه من الاغنياء المُترفين، اما الشطر الثاني فيمتد في الناحيه الشرقيه من العاصمه واغلب قاطنيه من الفقراء المحرومين.\nاما بالنسبه الى التلوث البيئي، فيعاني كل من شرق ووسط عمّان من عده مصادر للتلوث، اهمها التلوث المائي المتمثل بسيل الزرقاء الذي يمر من منطقه سقف السيل في وسط البلد ومجاري تصريف المياه في ماركا، والتي يندر وجودها في احياء عمّان الغربيه.\n\nمعلومات عامه\nامناء ورؤساء عمّان\nابتداء منذ تاسيس اول مجلس بلدي للمدينه عام 1909 في

      "summary": "عَمَّان هي عاصمة المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية ومركز محافظة العاصمة. تُعد أكبر مدن المملكة وواحدة من أكبر المدن العربية بالنسبة لعدد السكان، إذ بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2023 حوالي 4.8 مليون نسمة، مما يجعلها أيضًا واحدة من أسرع المدن نموًا بالسكان بالعالم. تقع المدينة في وسط المملكة على دائرة عرض 31 شمالاً وخط طول 35 شرقًا في منطقة تكثر فيها الجبال، فنشأت في الوديان بين الجبال أولاً فضاقت على سكانها، فارتقوا سفوحها واستمروا في الاتساع عبر قممها حتى انتشرت المدينة بأطرافها فوق 20 جبلا.\nتُعتبر عمّان المركز التجاري والإداري للأردن وقلبه الاقتصادي والتعليمي، حيث أصبحت عمّان نقطة استقطاب للكثير من الجاليات العربية لموقعها المتميز ولعمارتها المعاصرة، كما تستقطب عمّان الكثير من السياح سنويًا من أوروبا الغربية وأمريكا الشمالية واليابان وإستراليا ومن الدول العربية المجاورة والقريبة، وكثيرًا من عائلات دول الخليج العربي تحديدًا، إذ تكثر بها المعالم السياحية عمومًا والعلاجية الطبية خصوصاً. كان من نتيجة وقوع عمّان في مثل هذا الموقع الاستراتيجي في بلاد الشام والشرق الأوسط، أن أصبح موقعها يتحكم بالاقتصاد الوطني ويُحرّك 90% من الاستثمار على المستوى الوطني.\nيرجع تاريخ مدينة عمّان إلى الألف السابع قبل الميلاد، وبهذا تُعتبر من ضمن أقدم مدن العالم المأهولة بالسكان إلى يومنا هذا. وعمّان مدينة قديمة أقيمت على أنقاض مدينة عرفت باسم «ربّة عمّون» ثم «فيلادلفيا» ثم «عمّان» اشتقاقاً من «ربة عمّون»، واتخذها العمّونيون عاصمة لهم. وقد أُنشئت المدينة على تلال سبعة، وكانت مركزًا للمنطقة على ما يبدو في ذلك الوقت، وهي إحدى عواصم بلاد الشام الأربع، وهي أيضًا إحدى المدن الشامية القديمة التي أصبحت عاصمةً لإمارة شرق الأردن ومن ثم المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية بعد استقلالها في العام 1946 عن بريطانيا.\nيسكن عمّان الحديثة مجموعة متنوعة من السكان من أصول مختلفة أتوا من مختلف المناطق، منهم من أتى من مدن أردنية قريبة، ومنهم من أتى من فلسطين، ومنهم من القوقاز وسوريا والعراق.\nشهدت أمانة عمان الكبرى مؤخرًا تطورًا كبيرًا، حيث توسعت عمان بشكل لم تشهده المدينة من قبل. ونالت خطة مدينة عمّان الشمولية جوائز عالمية منها جائزة القيادة العالمية في تخطيط المدن وجائزة المدينة عن قارة آسيا لعام 2007. يبلغ عدد المناطق الإدارية في أمانة عمان 22 منطقة مُوزعة جغرافيا تحوي كل منطقة طاقمًا متكاملا من الموظفين، أما من الناحية الإدارية فهناك مجلس أمانة عمان الكبرى الذي يضم 68 عضوا برئاسة أمين العاصمة، والمجلس مقسم بدوره إلى 14 لجنة مختلفة.\nيُشار بالذكر إلى أنه تم اعتماد يوم 2 آذار/ مارس من كل عام يومًا لمدينة عمّان بعد إقرار مجلس الوزراء الأردني قرارًا بذلك في بداية عام 2021، وذلك في إطار الاحتفاء بمرور 100 عام على تأسيس الدولة الأردنيّة.",
