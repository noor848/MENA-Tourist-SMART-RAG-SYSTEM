      "content": "The Dead Sea (Arabic: اَلْبَحْر الْمَيِّت, romanized: al-Baḥr al-Mayyit; or اَلْبَحْر الْمَيْت, al-Baḥr al-Mayt; Hebrew: יַם הַמֶּלַח, romanized: Yam hamMelaḥ), also known by other names, is a landlocked salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east, the Israeli-occupied West Bank to the west and Israel to the southwest. It lies in the endorheic basin of the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.\nAs of 2025, the lake's surface is 439.78 metres (1,443 ft) below sea level, making its shores the lowest land-based elevation on Earth. It is 304 m (997 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342 g/kg, or 34.2% (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, 9.6 times as salty as the ocean—and has a density of 1.24 kg/litre, which makes swimming similar to floating. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea's main, northern basin is 50 kilometres (31 mi) long and 15 kilometres (9 mi) wide at its widest point.\nThe Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean basin for thousands of years. It was one of the world's first health resorts, and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilisers. Today, tourists visit the sea on its Israeli, Jordanian and West Bank coastlines.\nThe Dead Sea is receding at a swift rate; its surface area today is 605 km2 (234 sq mi), having been 1,050 km2 (410 sq mi) in 1930. Multiple canal and pipeline proposals, such as the scrapped Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance project, have been made to reduce its recession.\n\nNames\nThe English name \"Dead Sea\" is a calque of the Arabic name, itself a calque of earlier Greek and Latin names, in reference to the scarcity of aquatic life caused by the lake's extreme salinity.\nHistorical English names include the Salt Sea, Lake of Sodom from the biblical account of its destruction and Lake Asphaltites from Greek and Latin.\nThe name \"Dead Sea\" occasionally appears in Hebrew literature as Yām HamMāvet (ים המוות), 'Sea of Death'. However, the most common name for the lake in both biblical and modern Hebrew—and also its oldest known name—is the 'Sea of Salt' (Hebrew: ים המלח, romanized: Yām HamMelaḥ). Other Hebrew names for the lake also mentioned in the Bible are the Sea of Arabah (Hebrew: ים הערבה, romanized: Yām Ha'Ărāvâ) and the Eastern Sea (Hebrew: היםהקדמוני, romanized: HaYām HaQadmōnî). In the Talmud, it is called 'Sea of Salt' or 'Sea of Sodom'.\nThe Arabic name is al-Bahr al-Mayyit (البحر الميت), or usually without the article al-. It is also known in Arabic as the 'Sea of Lot' (Arabic: بحر لوط, romanized: baḥr Lūṭ, or بُحَيْرَة Buhayrat, بَحْرَة Bahret, or بِرْكَة لوط Birket Lūṭ) from the nephew of Abraham whose wife was said to have turned into a pillar of salt during the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Less often, it has been known in Arabic as the Sea of Zoara (بَحْر صُوغَر) from a formerly important city along its shores.\nBecause of the large volume of ancient trade in the lake's naturally occurring free-floating bitumen, its usual names in ancient Greek and Roman geography were some form of Asphalt Lake (Ancient Greek: Ἀσφαλτίτης, romanized: Asphaltítēs; or no: Ἀσφαλτίτις Λίμνη, romanized: Asphaltítis Límnē; Latin: Lacus Asphaltites) or Asphalt Sea (Ἀσφαλτίτης Θάλασσα, Asphaltítēs Thálassa).\nIt was also known as the 'Dead Sea' (Ancient Greek: Νεκρά Θάλασσα, romanized: Nekrá Thálassa; Latin: Mare Mortuum). Another ancient name is the \"Jewish Sea,\" (Latin: Iudaicum mare), a term used by the second-century Roman historian Tacitus.\n\nGeography\nThe Dead Sea is a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and Palestine's Israeli-occupied West Bank and Israel to the west. It is an endorheic lake, meaning there are no outlet streams.\nThe Dead Sea lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, a geographic feature formed by the Dead Sea Transform (DST). This left lateral-moving transform fault lies along the tectonic plate boundary between the African Plate and the Arabian Plate. It runs between the East Anatolian Fault zone in Turkey and the northern end of the Red Sea Rift offshore of the southern tip of Sinai.\nWater feeds into the Dead Sea from various sources, many small or intermittent, including:\n\nJordan River, international border from the north\nArava Stream (Wadi Arava), international border from the south\nWadi Mujib (Arnon Stream), Jordan, Karak Governorate\nWadi Darga (Wadi Darajeh, Nahal Darga, or Nahal Dragot), West Bank\nWadi al-Hasa (Brook of Zered), Jordan, boundary between Karak Governorate and Tafilah Governorate\nNahal Arugot (Wadi Areijeh or Wadi Argot), mouth at Ein Gedi, Israel\nWadi Wala, Jordan side\nWadi Zarqa Ma'in, Jordan side\nNahal Tur, West Bank\nNahal Og, West Bank\nGroundwater seepage\nDirect rainfall\n(Wadi is the Arabic term for a river valley with a small or intermittent stream; Nahal is the equivalent in Hebrew. The two terms are often used interchangeably in English names for the same body of water.)\nThe water of Wadi Hassa is now completely consumed in Jordan. The Jordan River, which passes through the Sea of Galilee, has been substantially diverted. It currently only contributes about one-sixth of the inflow to the Dead Sea, less than direct rainfall.\nThere are also small perennial springs under and around the Dead Sea, forming pools and quicksand pits along the edges.\nThe Wadi Mujib valley, 420 m below the sea level in the southern part of the Jordan valley, is a biosphere reserve, with an area of 212 km2 (82 sq mi).\nRainfall is scarcely 100 mm (4 in) per year in the northern part of the Dead Sea and barely 50 mm (2 in) in the southern part. The Dead Sea zone's aridity is due to the rainshadow effect of the Judaean Mountains. The highlands east of the Dead Sea receive more rainfall than the Dead Sea itself.\nTo the west of the Dead Sea, the Judaean mountains rise less steeply and are much lower than the mountains to the east. Along the southwestern side of the lake is a 210 m (700 ft) tall halite mineral formation called Mount Sodom.\n\nGeology\nFormation theories\nThere are two contending hypotheses about the origin of the low elevation of the Dead Sea. The older hypothesis is that the Dead Sea lies in a true rift zone, an extension of the Red Sea Rift, or even of the Great Rift Valley of eastern Africa. A more recent hypothesis is that the Dead Sea basin is a consequence of a \"step-over\" discontinuity along the Dead Sea Transform, creating an extension of the crust with consequent subsidence.\n\nSedom Lagoon\nDuring the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene, what is now the valley of the Jordan River, Dead Sea, and the northern Wadi Arabah was repeatedly inundated by waters from the Mediterranean Sea. The waters formed in a narrow, crooked bay that is called by geologists the Sedom Lagoon, which was connected to the sea through what is now the Jezreel Valley. The floods of the valley came and went depending on long-scale changes in the tectonic and climatic conditions.\nThe Sedom Lagoon extended at its maximum from the Sea of Galilee in the north to somewhere around 50 km (30 mi) south of the current southern end of the Dead Sea, and the subsequent lakes never surpassed this expanse. The Hula Depression was never part of any of these water bodies due to its higher elevation and the high threshold of the Korazim block separating it from the Sea of Galilee basin.\n\nSalt deposits\nThe Sedom Lagoon deposited evaporites mainly consisting of rock salt, which eventually reached a thickness of 2.3 km (1.43 mi) on the old basin floor in the area of today's Mount Sedom.\n\nLake formation\nAccording to Kafri, during the late Neogene, i.e. in the Pliocene (ended c. 2.5 million years ago), the eustatic sea level was at 50–100 metres above the current sea level, thus flooding the northern valleys connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the Jordan Rift Valley, which led to the creation of a crooked-shaped lagoon. This high eustatic sea level situation subsequently came to an end, and the ocean could no longer flood the area. Thus, the long lagoon became a landlocked lake, which – due to the high evaporation rate – retreated toward the lower, southern part of the rift valley. However, Mordechai Stein considers the formation process as not yet clarified, speaking of a late Pliocene-early Pleistocene process in which tectonics might also have played a part in blocking water ingression from the Mediterranean to its former bay or lagoon.\nThe first prehistoric lake to follow the Sedom Lagoon is named Lake Amora (which possibly appeared in the early Pleistocene; its sediments developed into the Amora (Samra) Formation, dated to over 200–80 kyr BP), followed by Lake Lisan (c. 70–14 kyr) and finally by the Dead Sea.\n\nLake salinity\nThe water levels and salinity of the successive lakes (Amora, Lisan, Dead Sea) have either risen or fallen as an effect of the tectonic dropping of the valley bottom, and due to climate variation. As the climate became more arid, Lake Lisan finally shrank and became saltier, leaving the Dead Sea as its last remainder.\nFrom 70,000 to 12,000 years ago, Lake Lisan's level was 100 to 250 m (330 to 820 ft) higher than its current level, possibly due to lower evaporation than in the present. Its level fluctuated dramatically, rising to its highest level around 26,000 years ago, indicating a very wet climate in the Near East. Around 10,000 years ago, the lake's level dropped dramatically, probably even lower than today. During the last several thousand years, the lake has fluctuated approximately 400 m (1,300 ft), with some significant drops and rises. Current theories as to the cause of this dramatic drop in levels rule out volcanic activity; therefore, it may have been a seismic event.\n\nSalt mounts formation\nIn prehistoric times, great amounts of sediment collected on the floor of Lake Amora. The sediment was heavier than the salt deposits and squeezed the salt deposits upwards into what are now the Lisan Peninsula and Mount Sodom (on the southwest side of the lake). Geologists explain the effect in terms of a bucket of mud into which a large flat stone is placed, forcing the mud to creep up the sides of the bucket. When the floor of the Dead Sea dropped further due to tectonic forces, the salt mounts of Lisan and Mount Sodom stayed in place as high cliffs (see salt dome).\n\nClimate\nThe Dead Sea has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), with year-round sunny skies and dry air. It has less than 50 millimetres (2 in) mean annual rainfall and a summer average temperature between 32 and 39 °C (90 and 102 °F). Winter average temperatures range between 20 and 23 °C (68 and 73 °F). The region has weaker ultraviolet radiation, particularly the UVB (erythrogenic rays). Given the higher atmospheric pressure, the air has a slightly higher oxygen content (3.3% in summer to 4.8% in winter) as compared to oxygen concentration at sea level. Barometric pressures at the Dead Sea were measured between 1061 and 1065 hPa and clinically compared with health effects at higher altitude. (This barometric measure is about 5% higher than sea level standard atmospheric pressure of 1013.25 hPa, which is the global ocean mean or ATM.) The Dead Sea affects temperatures nearby because of the moderating effect a large body of water has on climate. During the winter, sea temperatures tend to be higher than land temperatures, and vice versa during the summer months. This is the result of the water's mass and specific heat capacity. On average, there are 192 days above 30 °C (86 °F) annually.\n\nChemistry\nWith 34.2% salinity (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, though Lake Vanda in Antarctica (35%), Lake Assal in Djibouti (34.8%), Lagoon Garabogazköl in the Caspian Sea (up to 35%) and some hypersaline ponds and lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica (such as Don Juan Pond (44%)) have reported higher salinities.\nIn the 19th century and the early 20th century, the surface layers of the Dead Sea were less salty than today, which resulted in an average density in the range of 1.15–1.17 g/cm3 instead of the present value of around 1.25 g/cm3. A sample tested by Bernays in the 19th century had a salinity of 19%. By the year 1926, the salinity had increased (although it was also suspected that the salinity varies seasonally and depends on the distance from the mouth of the Jordan).\nUntil the winter of 1978–79, when a major mixing event took place, the Dead Sea was composed of two stratified layers of water that differed in temperature, density, age, and salinity. The topmost 35 meters (115 ft) or so of the Dead Sea had an average salinity of about 30%, and a temperature that swung between 19 and 37 °C (66 and 99 °F). Underneath a zone of transition, the lowest level of the Dead Sea had waters of a consistent 22 °C (72 °F) temperature, salinity of over 34%, and complete saturation of sodium chloride (NaCl). Since the water near the bottom is saturated with NaCl, that salt precipitates out of solution onto the sea floor.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, water inflow to the Dead Sea from the Jordan River was reduced as a result of large-scale irrigation and generally low rainfall. By 1975, the upper water layer was saltier than the lower layer. Nevertheless, the upper layer remained suspended above the lower layer because its waters were warmer and thus less dense. When the upper layer cooled so its density was greater than the lower layer, the waters mixed (1978–79). For the first time in centuries, the lake was a homogeneous body of water. Since then, stratification has begun to redevelop.\nThe mineral content of the Dead Sea is very different from that of ocean water. The exact composition of the Dead Sea water varies mainly with season, depth and temperature. In the early 1980s, the concentration of ionic species (in g/kg) of Dead Sea surface water was Cl− (181.4), Br− (4.2), SO42− (0.4), HCO3− (0.2), Ca2+ (14.1), Na+ (32.5), K+ (6.2) and Mg2+ (35.2). The total salinity was 276 g/kg. These results show that the composition of the salt, as anhydrous chlorides on a weight percentage basis, was calcium chloride (CaCl2) 14.4%, potassium chloride (KCl) 4.4%, magnesium chloride (MgCl2) 50.8% and sodium chloride (NaCl) 30.4%. In comparison, the salt in the water of most oceans and seas is approximately 85% sodium chloride. The concentration of sulfate ions (SO42−) is very low, and the concentration of bromide ions (Br−) is the highest of all waters on Earth.\n\nThe salt concentration of the Dead Sea fluctuates around 31.5%. This is unusually high and results in a nominal density of 1.24 kg/L. Anyone can easily float in the Dead Sea because of natural buoyancy. In this respect the Dead Sea is similar to the Great Salt Lake in Utah in the United States.\nAn unusual feature of the Dead Sea is its discharge of asphalt. From deep seeps, the Dead Sea constantly spits up small pebbles and blocks of the black substance. Asphalt-coated figurines and bitumen-coated Neolithic skulls from archaeological sites have been found. Egyptian mummification processes used asphalt imported from the Dead Sea region.\n\nPutative therapies\nThe Dead Sea area has become a location for health research and potential treatment for several reasons. The mineral content of the water, the low content of pollens and other allergens in the atmosphere, the reduced ultraviolet component of solar radiation, and the higher atmospheric pressure at this great depth each may have specific health effects. For example, persons experiencing reduced respiratory function from diseases such as cystic fibrosis seem to benefit from the increased atmospheric pressure.\nThe region's climate and low elevation have made it a popular center for assessment of putative therapies:\n\nClimatotherapy: Treatment which exploits local climatic features such as temperature, humidity, sunshine, barometric pressure and special atmospheric constituents\nHeliotherapy: Treatment that exploits the biological effects of the sun's radiation\nThalassotherapy: Treatment that exploits bathing in Dead Sea water\nThere is evidence that the  unique attenuation and spectrum of UV rays near the Dead Sea contribute to effective photoclimatherapy for psoriasis, in part because the reduced exposure to solar radiation allows for longer periods of sunbathing.\nRhinosinusitis patients receiving Dead Sea saline nasal irrigation exhibited improved symptom relief compared to standard hypertonic saline spray in one study.\nDead Sea mud pack therapy has been suggested to temporarily relieve pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knees. According to researchers of the Ben Gurion University of the Negev, treatment with mineral-rich mud compresses can be used to augment conventional medical therapy.\n\nLife forms\nThe sea is called \"dead\" because its high salinity prevents macroscopic aquatic organisms, such as fish and aquatic plants, from living in it, though minuscule quantities of bacteria and microbial fungi are present.\nIn times of flood, the salt content of the Dead Sea can drop from its usual 35% to 30% or lower. It temporarily comes to life in the wake of rainy winters. In 1980, after one such rainy winter, the normally dark blue Dead Sea turned red. Researchers from Hebrew University of Jerusalem found it to be teeming with an alga called Dunaliella. Dunaliella in turn nourished carotenoid-containing (red-pigmented) halobacteria, whose presence caused the color change. Since 1980, the basin has been dry and the algae and the bacteria have not returned in measurable numbers.\nIn 2011 a group of scientists from Be'er Sheva, Israel and Germany discovered fissures in the floor of the Dead Sea by scuba diving and observing the surface. These fissures allow fresh and brackish water to enter. They sampled biofilms surrounding the fissures and discovered numerous species of bacteria and archaea.\n\nHuman settlement\nThere are several small communities near the Dead Sea. These include Ein Gedi, Neve Zohar and the Israeli settlements in the Megilot Regional Council: Kalya, Mitzpe Shalem and Avnat. There is a nature preserve at Ein Gedi, and several Dead Sea hotels are located on the southwest end at Ein Bokek near Neve Zohar. Highway 90 runs north–south on the Israeli side for a total distance of 565 km (351 mi) from Metula on the Lebanese border in the north to its southern terminus at the Egyptian border near the Red Sea port of Eilat.\nPotash City is a small community on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, and others including Suweima. Highway 65 runs north–south on the Jordanian side from near Jordan's northern tip down past the Dead Sea to the port of Aqaba.\n\nHuman history\nBiblical period\nDwelling in caves near the Dead Sea is recorded in the Hebrew Bible as having taken place before the Israelites came to Canaan, and extensively at the time of King David.\nJust northwest of the Dead Sea is Jericho. Somewhere, perhaps on the southeastern shore, would be the cities mentioned in the Book of Genesis which were said to have been destroyed in the time of Abraham: Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 18) and the three other \"Cities of the Plain\", Admah, Zeboim and Zoar (Deuteronomy 29:23). Zoar escaped destruction when Abraham's nephew Lot escaped to Zoar from Sodom (Genesis 19:21–22). Before the destruction, the Dead Sea was a valley full of natural tar pits, which was called the vale of Siddim. King David was said to have hidden from Saul at Ein Gedi nearby.\nIn Ezekiel 47:8–9 there is a specific prophecy that the sea will \"be healed and made fresh\", becoming a normal lake capable of supporting marine life. A similar prophecy is stated in Zechariah 14:8, which says that \"living waters will go out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea [likely the Dead Sea] and half to the western sea [the Mediterranean].\"\nDuring the First Temple period, the kingdom of Judah ruled the western shore of the Dead Sea, while Moab controlled the eastern shore. To the south were the Edomites. Judah established several fortresses along its side of the sea. Development in this area was likely driven by new economic opportunities arising from the Dead Sea's natural resources, including salt, bitumen, as well as cash crops. Both Ein Gedi and Jericho on Judah's side were vital centers for cultivating the highly prized Judean date palms during this time. Ein Gedi thrived as a major economic hub in the final century of Judah, before its destruction on the eve of the Babylonian captivity.\n\nHellenistic and Roman period\nGreek and Jewish writers report that the Nabateans had monopolistic control over the Dead Sea.\n\nArchaeological evidence shows multiple anchorages existing on both sides of the sea, including in Ein Gedi, Khirbet Mazin (where the ruins of a Hasmonean-era dry dock are located), Numeira and near Masada. Josephus identified the Dead Sea in geographic proximity to the ancient Biblical city of Sodom. However, he referred to the lake by its Greek name, Asphaltites.\nHerod the Great, king of Judaea, built or rebuilt several fortresses and palaces along the western shore of the Dead Sea, with Masada being the most famous. Another historically important fortress was Machaerus (מכוור), on the eastern bank, where, according to Josephus, John the Baptist was imprisoned by Herod Antipas and died.\nDuring the Hellenistic and Roman periods, some Essenes, an ascetic Jewish sect, settled along the western shore of the Dead Sea. Roman historian Pliny the Elder identifies their location with the words, \"on the west side of the Dead Sea, away from the coast... [above] the town of Engeda\" (Natural History, Bk 5.73). Based on this, It is widely accepted, though still debated, that the Jewish community at Qumran was part of the Essene sect, and that the \"Dead Sea Scrolls\" discovered in nearby caves during the 20th century were their library.\nThe Dead Sea region was active during the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE). Early in the conflict, a group of Sicarii, a radical Jewish sect, seized control of the fortress of Masada and killed the Roman garrison stationed there. After their leader was killed in Jerusalem, the Sicarii fled to Masada and took refuge in the fortress. In 68 CE, Roman commander Vespasian, tasked with suppressing the Jewish revolt, arrived at the Dead Sea and tested its buoyancy by throwing bound, non-swimmer captives into the water. Archaeological evidence suggests that around this time, the Qumran community was destroyed. The Sicarii at Masada continued to resist the Romans after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, holding out until 73/74 CE, when a siege by the Roman Legio X Fretensis resulted in the deaths of 960 inhabitants by suicide, according to Josephus. The Roman camps surrounding Masada were constructed by Jewish slaves who received water from nearby towns, which were supplied with drinking water from the Ein Feshcha springs and other nearby sweetwater sources.\n\nThe town of Ein Gedi, mentioned many times in the Mishna, produced persimmon for the temple's fragrance and for export, using a secret recipe. \"Sodomite salt\" was an essential mineral for the temple's holy incense, but was said to be dangerous for home use and could cause blindness.\n\nByzantine period\nThe sixth-century mosaic known as the Madaba Map indicates that trade across the Dead Sea was very prevalent during the Byzantine period. \nConnected with the Judean wilderness to its northwest and west, the Dead Sea was a place of escape and refuge. The remoteness of the region attracted Greek Orthodox monks since the Byzantine era. Their monasteries, such as Saint George in Wadi Kelt and Mar Saba in the Judaean Desert, are places of pilgrimage.\nThe Jewish village of Ein Gedi, which had been continuously inhabited since the 5th century BCE, was destroyed in the 7th century by a devastating fire.\n\nMedieval period\nFrom the seventh century onwards, the Dead Sea area entered a period of decline and its population decreased. The cultivation of sugarcane near the northern and southern shores of the lake began to develop during the Crusader period and reached its peak under the Mamluks.\n\nModern times\nIn the 19th century the River Jordan and the Dead Sea were explored by boat primarily by Christopher Costigan in 1835, Thomas Howard Molyneux in 1847, William Francis Lynch in 1848, and John MacGregor in 1869. The full text of W. F. Lynch's 1849 book Narrative of the United States' Expedition to the River Jordan and the Dead Sea is available online. Charles Leonard Irby and James Mangles travelled along the shores of the Dead Sea already in 1817–18, but didn't navigate on its waters.\n\nExplorers and scientists arrived in the area to analyze the minerals and research the unique climate.\nAfter the find of the \"Moabite Stone\" in 1868 on the plateau east of the Dead Sea, Moses Wilhelm Shapira and his partner Salim al-Khouri forged and sold a whole range of presumed \"Moabite\" antiquities, and in 1883 Shapira presented what is now known as the \"Shapira Strips\", a supposedly ancient scroll written on leather strips which he claimed had been found near the Dead Sea. The strips were declared to be forgeries and Shapira took his own life in disgrace.\nThe 1922 census of Palestine lists 100 people (68 Muslims and 32 Christians) with \"Dead Sea & Jordan\" as their main locality. The 1931 census shows a sharp increase with 535 people (264 Muslims, 230 Jews, 21 Christians, 17 Druze, and three with no religion) listing \"Dead Sea\" as their main village/town. The 1938 nor 1945 village statistics does not give a number for the general Dead Sea area.\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, hundreds of Jewish religious documents dated between 150 BCE and 70 CE were found in caves near the ancient settlement of Qumran, about one mile (1.6 kilometres) inland from the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea (presently in the West Bank). They became known and famous as the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nThe world's lowest roads, Highway 90, run along the Israeli and West Bank shores of the Dead Sea, along with Highway 65 on the Jordanian side, at 393 m (1,289 ft) below sea level.\n\nTourism and leisure\nBritish Mandate period\nA golf course named for Sodom and Gomorrah was built by the British at Kalia on the northern shore.\n\nIsrael\nThe first major Israeli hotels were built in nearby Arad, and since the 1960s at the Ein Bokek resort complex.\nIsrael has 15 hotels along the Dead Sea shore, generating total revenues of $291 million in 2012. Most Israeli hotels and resorts on the Dead Sea are on a six-kilometre (3.7-mile) stretch of the southern shore.\n\nJordan\nOn the Jordanian side, nine international franchises have opened seaside resort hotels near the King Hussein Bin Talal Convention Center, along with resort apartments, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. The 9 hotels have boosted the Jordanian side's capacity to 2,800 rooms.\nOn 22 November 2015, the Dead Sea panorama road was included along with 40 archaeological locations in Jordan, to become live on Google Street View.\n\nPalestine (West Bank)\nThe portion of Dead Sea coast which Palestinians could possibly eventually manage is about 40 kilometres (25 miles) long. The World Bank estimates that such Dead Sea tourism industry could generate $290 million of revenues per year and 2,900 jobs. However, Palestinians have been unable to obtain construction permits for tourism-related investments on the Dead Sea. According to the World Bank, officials in the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities state that the only way to apply for such permits is through the Joint Committees established under the Oslo Agreement, but the relevant committee has not met with any degree of regularity since 2000.\n\nChemical industry\nBritish Mandate period\nIn the early part of the 20th century, the Dead Sea began to attract interest from chemists who deduced the sea was a natural deposit of potash (potassium chloride) and bromine. A concession was granted by the British Mandatory government to the newly formed Palestine Potash Company in 1929. Its founder, Siberian Jewish engineer and pioneer of Lake Baikal exploitation, Moses Novomeysky, had worked for the charter for over ten years having first visited the area in 1911. The first plant, on the north shore of the Dead Sea at Kalya, commenced production in 1931 and produced potash by solar evaporation of the brine. Employing Arabs and Jews, it was an island of peace in turbulent times. In 1934 a second plant was built on the southwest shore, in the Mount Sodom area, south of the 'Lashon' region of the Dead Sea. Palestine Potash Company supplied half of Britain's potash during World War II. Both plants were destroyed by the Jordanians in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.\n\nIsrael\nThe Dead Sea Works was founded in 1952 as a state-owned enterprise based on the remnants of the Palestine Potash Company. In 1995, the company was privatized and it is now owned by Israel Chemicals. From the Dead Sea brine, Israel produces (2001) 1.77 million tons potash, 206,000 tons elemental bromine, 44,900 tons caustic soda, 25,000 tons magnesium metal, and sodium chloride. Israeli companies generate around US$3 billion annually from the sale of Dead Sea minerals (primarily potash and bromine), and from other products that are derived from Dead Sea Minerals.\n\nJordan\nOn the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, Arab Potash (APC), formed in 1956, produces 2.0 million tons of potash annually, as well as sodium chloride and bromine. The plant is located at Safi, South Aghwar Department, in the Karak Governorate.\nJordanian Dead Sea mineral industries generate about $1.2 billion in sales (equivalent to 4 percent of Jordan's GDP).\n\nWest Bank\nThe Palestinian Dead Sea Coast is about 40 kilometres (25 miles) long. The Palestinian economy is unable to benefit from Dead Sea chemicals due to restricted access, permit issues and the uncertainties of the investment climate. The World Bank estimates that a Palestinian Dead Sea chemicals industry could generate $918M incremental value added per year, \"almost equivalent to the contribution of the entire manufacturing sector of Palestinian territories today\".\n\nExtraction\nBoth companies, Dead Sea Works Ltd. and Arab Potash, use extensive salt evaporation pans that have essentially diked the entire southern end of the Dead Sea for the purpose of producing carnallite, potassium magnesium chloride, which is then processed further to produce potassium chloride. The ponds are separated by a central dike that runs roughly north–south along the international border. The power plant on the Israeli side allows production of magnesium metal (by a subsidiary, Dead Sea Magnesium Ltd.).\nDue to the popularity of the sea's therapeutic and healing properties, several companies have also shown interest in the manufacturing and supplying of Dead Sea salts as raw materials for body and skin care products.\n\nRecession and environmental concerns\nReceding shoreline\nSince 1930, when its surface was 1,050 km2 (410 sq mi) and its level was 390 m (1,280 ft) below sea level, the Dead Sea has been monitored continuously. The Dead Sea has been rapidly shrinking since the 1960s because of diversion of incoming water from the Jordan River to the north as part of the National Water Carrier scheme, completed in 1964. The southern end is fed by a canal maintained by the Dead Sea Works, a company that converts the sea's raw materials. From a water surface of 395 m (1,296 ft) below sea level in 1970 it fell 22 to 418 m (72 to 1,371 ft) below sea level in 2006, reaching a drop rate of 1 m (3 ft) per year.  By 2025 it reached a height of 439 m (1,440 ft) below sea level, a drop of more than 1 m (3 ft) per year. As the water level decreases, the characteristics of the Sea and surrounding region may substantially change.\nAs of 2021, the surface of the Sea has shrunk by about 33 percent since the 1960s, which is partly attributed to the much-reduced flow of the Jordan River since the construction of the National Water Carrier project, and the amount of water from the rains reaching the Dead Sea has diminished even further since flash floods started pouring into the sinkholes left by its shrinkage. The EcoPeace Middle East, a joint Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian environmental group, has estimated that the annual flow into the Dead Sea from the Jordan is as of 2021 less than 100,000,000 cubic metres (3.5×109 cu ft) of water, compared with former flows of between 1,200,000,000 cubic metres (4.2×1010 cu ft) and 1,300,000,000 cubic metres (4.6×1010 cu ft).\n\nSources: Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research, Haaretz, Jordan Valley Authority.\n\nSinkholes and their impact\nThe Dead Sea level drop has been followed by a groundwater level drop, causing brines that used to occupy underground layers near the shoreline to be flushed out by freshwater. This is believed to be the cause of the recent appearance of large sinkholes along the western shore—incoming freshwater dissolves salt layers, rapidly creating subsurface cavities that subsequently collapse to form these sinkholes. As of 2021 Ein Gedi, on the western coast, has been subject to a large number of sinkholes appearing in the area, attributed to the decline in the water level of the Dead Sea.\nAs a result of the sinkholes, most beach resorts along the west shore of the northern basin had to be shut down, with just three remaining near the basin's northwest tip (see List of beaches in Palestine: Dead Sea).\n\nLink to the Red Sea\nIn May 2009 at the World Economic Forum, Jordan introduced plans for a \"Jordan National Red Sea Development Project\" (JRSP). This is a plan to convey seawater from the Red Sea near Aqaba to the Dead Sea. Water would be desalinated along the route to provide fresh water to Jordan, with the brine discharge sent to the Dead Sea for replenishment. Israel has expressed its support and will likely benefit from some of the water delivery to its Negev region.\nAt a regional conference in July 2009, officials expressed concern about the declining water levels. Some suggested industrial activities around the Dead Sea might need to be reduced. Others advised environmental measures to restore conditions such as increasing the volume of flow from the Jordan River to replenish the Dead Sea. Currently, only sewage and effluent from fish ponds run in the river's channel. Experts also stressed the need for strict conservation efforts. They said agriculture should not be expanded, sustainable support capabilities should be incorporated into the area and pollution sources should be reduced.\nIn October 2009, the Jordanians accelerated plans to extract around 300 million cubic metres (11 billion cubic feet) of water per year from the Red Sea, desalinate it for use as fresh water and send the waste water to the Dead Sea by tunnel, despite concerns about inadequate time to assess the potential environmental impact. According to Jordan's minister for water, General Maysoun Zu'bi, this project could be considered as the first phase of the Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance.\nIn December 2013, Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement for laying a water pipeline to link the Red Sea with the Dead Sea. The pipeline would be 180 km (110 mi) long and is estimated to take up to five years to complete. In January 2015 it was reported that the level of water was dropping by 1 m (3.3 ft) a year.\nOn 27 November 2016, the Jordanian government shortlisted five consortia to implement the project. Jordan's ministry of Water and Irrigation said that the $100 million first phase of the project would begin construction in the first quarter of 2018, and would be completed by 2021. The project was officially abandoned in June 2021, having never broken ground.\n\nSee also\nAral Sea\nList of bodies of water by salinity\nList of drying lakes\nList of places on land with elevations below sea level\nMediterranean–Dead Sea Canal\nBenjamin Elazari Volcani\nPEF rock with the Dead Sea level reference line used between 1900 and 1913\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nThe World Bank, 2013, \"The Red Sea – Dead Sea Water Conveyance Study Program\", and source of basic data on the Dead Sea.\nYehouda Enzel, et al., eds (2006) New Frontiers in Dead Sea Paleoenvironmental Research, Geological Society of America, ISBN 978-0-8137-2401-0\nNiemi, Tina M., Ben-Avraham, Z., and Gat, J., eds., 1997, The Dead Sea: The Lake and Its Setting: N.Y., Oxford University Press, 286 p.\nWorld Bank, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Department, Area C and the Future of the Palestinian Economy, October 2, 2013\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Dead Sea at Wikimedia Commons\n Dead Sea travel guide from Wikivoyage   (Israeli and West Bank part and Jordanian part)\n The dictionary definition of Dead Sea at Wiktionary\nPorter, Josias Leslie (1878). \"Dead Sea\" .

      "summary": "The Dead Sea (Arabic: اَلْبَحْر الْمَيِّت, romanized: al-Baḥr al-Mayyit; or اَلْبَحْر الْمَيْت, al-Baḥr al-Mayt; Hebrew: יַם הַמֶּלַח, romanized: Yam hamMelaḥ), also known by other names, is a landlocked salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east, the Israeli-occupied West Bank to the west and Israel to the southwest. It lies in the endorheic basin of the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.\nAs of 2025, the lake's surface is 439.78 metres (1,443 ft) below sea level, making its shores the lowest land-based elevation on Earth. It is 304 m (997 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342 g/kg, or 34.2% (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, 9.6 times as salty as the ocean—and has a density of 1.24 kg/litre, which makes swimming similar to floating. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea's main, northern basin is 50 kilometres (31 mi) long and 15 kilometres (9 mi) wide at its widest point.\nThe Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean basin for thousands of years. It was one of the world's first health resorts, and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilisers. Today, tourists visit the sea on its Israeli, Jordanian and West Bank coastlines.\nThe Dead Sea is receding at a swift rate; its surface area today is 605 km2 (234 sq mi), having been 1,050 km2 (410 sq mi) in 1930. Multiple canal and pipeline proposals, such as the scrapped Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance project, have been made to reduce its recession.",

      "title": "البحر الميت",
      "content": "البحر الميت هو بحيره ملحيه مغلقه تقع في اخدود وادي الاردن ضمن الشق السوري الافريقي، على خط الحدود الفاصل بين الاردن وفلسطين التاريخيه (الضفه الغربيه والداخل المحتل). يشتهر البحر الميت بانه اخفض نقطه على سطح الكره الارضيه، حيث بلغ منسوب شاطئه حوالي 400 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر حسب سجلات عام 2013. كما يتميز البحر الميت بشده ملوحته، اذ تبلغ نسبه الاملاح فيه حوالي 34%، وهي ما تمثل تسعه اضعاف تركيز الاملاح في البحر المتوسط، وواحده من اعلى نسب الملوحه بالمسطحات المائيه في العالم. وقد نتجت هذه الاملاح لان البحيره هي وجهه نهائيه للمياه التي تصب فيه، حيث انه لا يوجد اي مخرج لها بعده.\nيصل عرض البحر الميت في اقصى حد الى 17 كم، بينما يبلغ طوله حوالي 70 كم. وقد بلغت مساحته في عام 2010 حوالي 650 كم2 اذ تقلصت خلال الاربع عقود الماضيه بما يزيد عن 35%. كما يلعب المناخ الصحراوي للمنطقه الذي يمتاز بشده الحراره والجفاف ومعدلات التبخر العاليه دورًا كبيرًا في زياده تركيز تلك الاملاح فيه.\nلقد عانى منسوب البحر الميت مؤخرًا من التراجع المستمر، حيث يرجع هذا الامر الى عدد من الاسباب الرئيسيه، كالاستخدام المكثف لمصادر المياه، واهمها نهر الاردن، وضخ المياه في الحوض الجنوبي، حيث يتكون البحر الميت حاليًا من حوضين؛ شمالي وجنوبي يقسمهما شبه جزيره اللسان. ونتيجه للانخفاض المستمر لهذا المستوى، تعرض الجزء الجنوبي من البحيره للجفاف، حيث انّ الجزء الجنوبي اقل عمقًا من نظيره الشمالي، ويصل ارتفاع منسوب شاطئه الى 401 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر. ومع تجفيف الجزء الجنوبي، تم انشاء برك لتبخير المياه وانتاج البوتاس والمواد الكيماويه الاخرى مثل المنجنيز والمغنسيوم والبرومين في مصانع البوتاس الاسرائيليه، وشركه البوتاس العربيه في الاردن. وتحتاج تلك البرك الى ضخ كبير من مياه البحر الميت وتبخيرها، مما اثّر تاثيرًا كبيرًا على زياده انخفاض مستوى سطح البحر.\nلقد بلغ المعدل السنوي لانخفاض مستوى سطح البحر خلال العقد المنصرم بمقدار يعادل الفقدان لمده سنه كامله، حيث اصبح المستوى ينخفض حوالي متر واحد كل عام. ولقد زاد هذا المعدل في عام 2012 بشكل واضح، فكان انخفاض مستوى البحر 1.40 متر. وقد ادى الانخفاض التراكمي في مستوى المياه الى تغيرات كبيره ايضا في تضاريس المناطق المجاوره وفي البحر الابيض المتوسط بما في ذلك تغيرات لا يمكن الرجوع عنها في الجزء الشمالي، من خلق للمجاري، والانسحاب من الشواطئ، والاضرار التي لحقت بالبنيه التحتيه (الطرق والجسور) والمحميات الطبيعيه.\nيُعد البحر الميت مهماً جدًا للصناعه والسياحه في المنطقه، حيث تُعتبر تركيبه مياهه مختلفه عن المياه الطبيعيه، باحتوائها على تركيز عالي من الكالسيوم والبوتاسيوم. ويُستغل هذا في مصانع الجانبين الاردني والاسرائيلي. وترجع الاهميه التاريخيه والسياحيه لمنطقه حوض البحر الميت الى البحر نفسه والى شواطئه، حيث توجد بعض المعالم الاثريه والدينيه الهامه في المنطقه مثل مسعده، وخربه قمران، وكهف النبي لوط، بالاضافه الى التشكيلات الملحيه الطبيعيه، والمناخ السائد فيه، فكلها جعلت من البحر الميت نقطه جذب سياحيه عالميه، وخصوصًا فيما يتعلق بالسياحه العلاجيه. وتحوي المنطقه على الاف الغرف الفندقيه، حيث تتركز في الجزء الشمالي الشرقي في الاردن، بالاضافه الى الجزء الغربي المطل على الحوض الجنوبي. وقد رُشح ليكون احد عجائب الدنيا السبع الطبيعيه في نطاق البحيرات.\nورغم ان دوله فلسطين لها جزء يطل على البحر الميت الا ان السلطات الاسرائيليه لا تسمح للفلسطينيين باستغلال مواردهم من البحر، بل تمنعهم تماما من الذهاب الى ساحل البحر الميت بحجه الامن. وتشكل حقوق الفلسطينيين في استغلال نصيبهم من البحر الميت نقطه هامه في مباحثات السلام، بالاضافه الى حقوقهم في مياه الشرب.\n\nالتسميه\nاُطلق على البحر الميت تاريخيّا عده اسماء قديمه في العهد القديم مثل: «بحر الملح» و«بحر العربه» و«البحر الشرقي» و«عمق السديم». وفي عهد عيسى المسيح عُرف بـ «بحر الموت»، و«بحر سدوم» نسبه الى منطقه سدوم المجاوره، كما دُعي «البحيره المنتنه» لان مياهه وشواطئه لها رائحه منتنه. كما دُعي «بحيره زغر» نسبه الى بلده زُغر التي كانت تقع على شاطئه الجنوبي الشرقي، واُطلق عليه اسم «بحر الزفت» نسبهً الى قطع الزفت التي كانت تطفو على سطحه في بعض الاحيان وخاصه عند حدوث الزلازل. وقد كان بعض سكان المنطقه يتاجرون في قطع الزفت التي يستخرجونها ويبيعونها. كما ذكره المقدسي في كتابه «احسن التقاسيم في معرفه الاقاليم» باسم «البحيره المقلوبه». وقد سُمي ايضًا «بحيره لوط» نسبهً الى النبي لوط الذي سكن وقومه بالقرب منه قبل ان يحل بهم العذاب. اما الاغريق فكانوا اول من اطلق عليه اسم «البحر الميت» لعدم وجود حياه فيه.\nوحسب نظريه عالم الاراضه البروفيسور ليو بيكارد كان في الماضي جزءا من بحيره واسعه حلوه المياه امتدت على منطقه غور الاردن ومرج ابن عامر وصبت في البحر الابيض المتوسط. وحسب هذه النظريه اسفرت التغييرات في علوّ الارض قبل مليوني عام تقريباً الى انقطاع الوصله بين تلك البحيره والبحر الابيض المتوسط، والى تضيق البحيره الى بحيره طبريا، نهر الاردن والبحر الميت. فادى حصر مياه البحر الميت، وتبخر الماء الى زياده نسبه الاملاح فيه.\n\nالجغرافيا\nيحد البحر الميت من الشرق جبال محافظه مادبا ومحافظه الكرك في الاردن، ومن الغرب الضفه الغربيه وجبال الخليل في فلسطين. اما شمالاً فيحده منخفض البحر الميت ومصب نهر الاردن، ومن الجنوب جرف خنزيره، الذي يُعتبر بدايه وادي عربه. يُعتبر خط التقسيم فيه حدًا فاصلاً بين الاردن وفلسطين تماشيًا مع نهر الاردن في الشمال، ووادي عربه في الجنوب. يقع بين دائرتيّ عرض 31.03 و31.43 شمالاً، وبين خطيّ طول 35.21 و35.35 شرقًا. يبعد عن القدس 24 كم الى الشرق، وعن عمّان 38 كم الى الجنوب الغربي. تبلغ مساحته الاصليه حوالي 1000 كم2، الا انها تقلّصت خلال الاربع عقود الماضيه الى حوالي 650 كم2. ويبلغ اقصى عرض له 17.5 كم، واضيق نقطه تقع عند مضيق اللسان بعرض 2 كم، اما اعمق نقطه فيه فتقع على بعد 5 كم جنوب غرب مصب وادي زرقاء ماعين، ويبلغ عمقها 399 م، بينما ينخفض سطحه بحوالي 395 عن سطح البحر المتوسط.\nوتحف الشواطئ الشرقيه والغربيه للبحر الميت منحدرات عموديه على شكل ابراج صدعيه والتي تشكل جزءاً من الشق السوري الافريقي. ان منحدرات الوادي تتجه الى اعلى برقه الى ناحيه الشمال في اتجاه نهر الاردن والى ناحيه الجنوب في اتجاه وادي عربه. ومن الناحيه التاريخيه فان البحر الميت يتكون من حوضان: الحوض الرئيسي الشمالي والذي يبلغ عمقه 320 مترًا (في عام 1997) والحوض الجنوبي الضحل والذي منه تراجع البحر الميت منذ عام 1978. والحوضين منقسمان عن طريق شبه جزيره لسان ومضايق الموت التي لديها تل من الطمي.\n\nالمناخ\nيتمتع البحر الميت بسماء مشمسه على مدار السنه، بالاضافه الى الهواء الجاف. وتتساقط الامطار على المنطقه بشكل قليل جداً باقل من 50 ملم (2 بوصه) بينما يبلغ متوسط درجه الحراره في الصيف بين 32 و39 درجه مئويه. وتتراوح درجات الحراره في فصل الشتاء المتوسط بين 20 و23 درجه مئويه. كما تعتبر نسبه الرطوبه منخفضه حيث توازي 35% في معدلها. اما الاشعاعات الشمسيه، فلقد دلّت الدراسات على وجود طبقه غنيه بالاوزون فوق سطح البحر تصل الى ارتفاع 25 كيلومتراً، ويقوم الاوزون بالاضافه الى بخار الماء فوق البحر بعمليه ترشيح وفلتره للاشعه الفوق بنفسجيه.\nويُعد تركيز الاكسجين في هواء منطقه البحر الميت الاعلى في العالم، بصفته المنطقه الاكثر انخفاضًا. وتصل نسبه الاكسجين فيه الى 36%، علمًا بان النسبه العالميه تصل الى 26%. اما بالنسبه الى الضغوط الجوي في منطقه البحر الميت، فيترواح بين 796 و799 ملم زئبقي، وبهذا يُعتبر الاعلى في العالم.\n\nالجيولوجيا\nيشكل وادي الاردن جزءاً من الاخدود العظيم (حفره الانهدام التاريخيه) والذي يمتد من تركيا الى شرق افريقيا. وقد تشكل نتيجه تغيرات جيولوجيه شهدتها القشره الارضيه منذ ملايين السنين، وقد تشكّل في قلبها البحر الميت الذي كان يمتد في الاصل على طول 360 كلم من العقبه جنوبًا الى بحيره طبريا شمالاً. يعتبر وادي الاردن بارضه الخصبه ومناخه الدافئ، والبحر الميت بمياهه العلاجيه، مركز جذب سكاني عبر التاريخ، فقد شهد هذا الوادي العديد من الاقوام والحضارات التي تعود الى عصور قديمه جدًا. وقد تم الكشف عن اكثر من 200 موقع اثري حتى اليوم، ومعظم هذه المواقع المحيطه بمنطقه البحر الميت تتصل اتصالاً وثيقًا باحداث ذُكرت في الكتاب المقدس، ومن اهمها كهف النبي لوط.\nوقد اجرى بعض الباحثين الاسرائيليين مسحًا جيولوجيًا لقاع البحر الميت عام 1967، وقالوا: «يبدوا ان قاع البحر الميت الحالي مكون من صخور تكوين اصدم الملحي الذي يقع تحت الحوض الجنوبي للبحر الميت». بمعنى ان هذه الكتله كانت تحت قرى النبي لوط، وان تكوين هذه البقعه المنخفضه كما ورد مشابه لتكوين اصدم، بينما المحيط الموجود فيه هو من تكوينات جيولوجيه مختلفه عنها، هذا بالاضافه الى وجود صدوع مستعرضه حول هذه البقعه تؤكد انها لم تكن اساسًا ضمن التكوين الصخري الموجود فيه، وانما جاءته من منطقه اخرى، وهذا يؤيد حدوث مثل هذا الانزلاق لهذه الكتله الصخريه. كما يؤيد صحه هذا الدليل صوره الاقمار الصناعيه لقاع البحر الميت، والتي يظهر فيها ست نقاط يُعتقد انها تجمعات سكانيه تمثل قرى النبي لوط، وصوره غواصه بريطانيه لنفس المنطقه عام 1957 يظهر فيها ايضًا اثار مساكن وقرى مطموه بالملح.\n\nالتشكل\nيُعتبر البحر الميت ظاهره طبيعيه نادره الوجود في العالم، فهو بحيره مغلقه لا تتصل بالبحار الخارجيه المجاوره (البحر المتوسط والبحر الاحمر). كما يقع في منطقه كانت جزءاً من الموطن الاصلي للانسان الاول، ومهبطًا للديانات السماويه الرئيسيه، ومكانًا لنشوء الحضارات القديمه، ومعبرًا للحركات التجاريه والغزوات العسكريه عبر العصور التاريخيه المتتابعه.\n\nيعود بدايه التشكل الجيولوجي للبحر الميت الى اواخر العصر الثلاثي، اي قبل حوالي 3 - 7 مليون سنه. فقد تكوّن على انقاض البحيرات القديمه التي شغلت الانهدام الاردني حيث يقول علماء الجيولوجيا: ان «بحر تيش» او Tythas الذي يشغل البحر المتوسط جزءاً من مكانه، كان يغطي اغلب اراضي المنطقه العربيه، وبعد انحساره وتراجعه ووصوله الى الشكل الحالي للبحر المتوسط، بقيت منطقه الغور ممتلئه بالمياه مكونه بحيره اصدم القديمه التي كانت تتصل بالبحر المتوسط بواسطه مرج بن عامر ثم غور الاردن الاوسط حتى عصر الميوسين. وبعد عصر الميوسين، انقطع اتصال البحيره الاردنيه القديمه (بحيره ما بعد اصدم) بالبحر المتوسط. واخذت تنحصر شيئاً فشيئاً نتيجه لارتفاع مستوى التبخر في المنطقه بسبب درجات الحراره المرتفعه. ويعتقد العلماء بان البحيره تعرضت لعمليه هبوط ثانيه بسبب الضغط الكبير الواقع عليها، بسبب تركز الاملاح في قاعها حتى تكوّن البحر الميت بشكله الحالي والذي يعتبره علماء الجيولوجيا حاله دراسيه نادره الوجود، حيث يقع اطول فالق ازاحي قاري في العالم يصل امتداده الى اكثر من 1000 كم مصحوب بازاحه جانبيه تبلغ حوالي 105 كم. وقد لفت انهدام البحر الميت بتشكيله الجيولوجي ونشاطه التكتوني انتباه الكثير من العلماء في شتى مجالات علوم الارض.\nتتميز مياه البحر الميت بشده ملوحتها التي تصل الى 340 غم/ لتر في اعماقه، وهي نسبه كبيره جدًا، اذ تبلغ الملوحه فيه عشره اضعاف ملوحه البحار والمحيطات. ويختزن البحر الميت في باطنه ثروه هائله لمجموعه كبيره من الاملاح قد لا تنضب بسبب ضخامه حجمها ودخولها في الصناعات الحديثه. اختلفت الاراء حول اصل تكون هذه الاملاح، وفيما يلي استعراض لثلاث نظريات تفسر كيفيه تكونها:\n\nنظريه ترسيب الاملاح البحريه: وتقول ان هذه الاملاح جاءت من مصدرين هما الترسيب المائي، والترسيب الجوي.\nنظريه تجمع الاملاح التحتيه: وتقول ان الاملاح تكونت من مياه نهر الاردن والاوديه والينابيع الجانبيه التي ترفد البحر الميت مباشره، فهي تحتوي على كميات هائله من الاملاح مشابهه لاملاح البحر الميت.\nنظريه الامطار البركانيه: وتقول ان جزءاً من املاح البحر الميت تكون نتيجه العذاب الذي حل بقوم لوط.\n\nالتركيب الكيمائي\nتُقدر كميه التبخر في مياه البحر الميت بحوالي 1600 ملم في العام. وبحسب الفحوصات التي اُجريت على مياهه فان عمليه التبخر والتغيرات الكيمائيه تحدث خلال الاربعين مترٍ العليا، وما دونها فهو ثابت لا يتغير. اذاً تختلف كميه ونوعيه الاملاح حسب العمق. وتبلغ الاملاح المذابه 44 مليار و957 مليون طن. ومن هذه الكميه تُقدر المواد التاليه بملايين الاطنان: كلوريد المغنيسيوم حوالي 23 الف مليون طن، ملح الطعام حوالي 12 الف مليون طن، كلوريد الكالسيوم حوالي 6 الاف مليون طن، كلوريد البوتاسيوم حوالي الفين مليون طن، بروميد المغنسيوم حوالي 975 مليون طن، كبريتات الكالسيوم حوالي 105 مليون طن، بيكربونات الكالسيوم حوالي 46 مليون طن، وكلوريد الروبيديوم حوالي 12 مليون طن.\nومن الجدير بالذكر، ان هناك مصادر اخرى عملت على زيادره نسبه الاملاح في البحر الميت كالينابيع الساخنه والمعدنيه مثل: ينابيع الزهار الكبريتيه، وحمامات زرقاء ماعين، اذ ان التحاليل التي اُُجريت على مياه هذه المصادر دلت على نفس التركيب الكيماوي لمياه البحر الميت، حتى ان التحاليل الكيميائيه التي اُجريت لمياه منجم بترول اسدم اظهرت علاقتها بمياه البحر الميت.\nان قوه تركيز املاح البحر الميت التي ينفرد بها عن كل بحار العالم الداخليه هي عجيبه في حد ذاتها. ولا يقف الامر عند هذا الحد، بل ان التركيب الكيماوي لمياه هذا البحر يختلف ايضًا عن غيره من بحار العالم الداخليه الاخرى، فهو يتكون في معظمه من املاح الكبريتات والكربونات. والغريب في الامر ايضًا، ان املاح الكالسيوم تكاد تكون معدومه، اذ ان ذلك لا يحدث لاي بحر داخلي مثل البحر الميت. والاغرب من ذلك كله وجود كميه البروم العاليه التي تبلغ 5920 ملغم لكل لتر والتي لا يوجد مثلها في اي بحر معروف، حيث ان كميه البروم في المحيطات تبلغ 290 ملغم/ لتر وفي البحار المالحه 1000 ملغم/ لتر.\n\nالروافد المغذيه\nيغذّي البحر الميت بالاضافه الى نهر الاردن، عدد من الوديان والسيول الممتده على جانبيه الغربي والشرقي. اذ يبلغ عددها من الجانب الغربي 23 واديًا وسيلاً، فيما يبلغ عددها من الشرق 5 فقط.\nوتبلغ مساحه المجاري المتعلقه بالبحر الميت 40,6 كم2. وتاتي معظم تدفقات المياه الى البحر الميت من مناطق ذات الكثافه المطريه النسبيه لمجرى نهر الاردن الى الشمال والمنحدرات العموديه للوادي المتصدع لشرق وغرب البحر الميت. والى الجنوب، يغطي خط تقسيم مياه وادي عربه المناطق القاحله للنقب وصحراء الاردن الجنوبيه.\n\nمشروع القناه\nيمر مُستوى المياه في هذا البحر التاريخي يتراجع حاليًا بمُعدلات لا تُصدق تاركًا خلفه الاف الحفر، حيث يوجد حاليًا ما يُقارب 3000 حُفره على الجانب الغربي ومئات الحُفر على الجانب الشرقي، وذلك بارتفاع شديد في وتيره تشكل هذه الحُفر بشكل فُجائي، في وقت كان البحر يحتوي فيه على 40 حفره فقط في العام 1990. الخُبراء في هذه المجال يُشيرون الى ان مثل هذه الحفر تظهر حاليًا بمُعدّل حُفره واحده يوميًا، وان المخيف فيها هو عدم وجود طريقه بمعرفه مكان او توقيت ظُهورها. ظهور هذه الحفر متعلق بصوره مباشره بتعرض البحر الميت للجفاف بمُعدل متر واحد سنويًا، بحيث تنهار الارض فجاهً وتتشكّل حفر كبيره احيانًا مما يُشكل خطرًا على المناطق المُحيطه بالبحر من مزارع وطرقات وحتى ابنيه كالفنادق او المنازل. وتتشكل الحُفر هذه نتيجهً لتفاعُل المياه العذبه القادمه من مياه الامطار او بعض الينابيع تحت الارض بالاملاح الموجوده في الارض بعد تعرُض مساحات جديده للتجفيف.\nولانقاذ البحر الميت من الجفاف، قام الاردن بالتعاون مع كل من السلطه الفلسطينيه واسرائيل بالتخطيط لمشروع اُطلق عليه «قناه البحرين»، وهو مشروع مقترح لشق قناه تربط بين البحر الميت واحد البحار الـمفتوحه (البحر الاحمر او البحر الابيض المتوسط)، مستفيدا من 400 متر الفرق في منسوب المياه بيـن البحار. قد تعوض المياه المتدفقه عبر القناه انخفاض مستوى البحر الميت بسبب تحويل المياه الى اسرائيل بواسطه سد دغانيا المقام على نقطه الاتصال بين بحيره طبريا ونهر الاردن. وسحب المياه الحلوه المتدفقه طبيعيًا الى البحر الميت الى اجهزه الري الاسرائيليه والفلسطينيه والاردنيه. بالمقابل، عارض المشروع الكثير من المنظمات البيئيه في المنطقه، حيث اشارت عدد من الدراسات ان تدفق حوالي ملياري متر مكعب سنويًا من مياه البحر الاحمر الى البحر الميت سيحدث تاثيرات بالغه الخطوره على كنوز وثروات البحر الاحمر، حيث مناطق الشعب المرجانيه وحدائقها التي لا تقدر بثمن، كما سيغير من تركيبه البحر الميت. من جهه اخرى، يرى نشطاء سياسيون ان للمشروع ابعادًا سياسيه واستراتيجه تضر الاردن والسلطه الفلسطينيه، وهي بناء المستوطنات الاسرائيليه، وجلب المزيد من المهاجرين وخلق واقع ديموغرافي جديد في المنطقه وخلق رافد بشري مستمر لقواها العسكريه.\nوقد تم التوقيع رسميًا على اتفاقيه بين الاطراف الثلاثه في كانون الاول/ ديسمبر 2013 لمد خط انابيب ينقل المياه من البحر الاحمر الى البحر الميت، حيث استمر تداول خطه ربط البحرين الاحمر والميت على مدار عقود وخضعت للعديد من التغيرات، كما انها كانت مُتضمنه ايضًا في اتفاقيه السلام بين اسرائيل والاردن عام 1994. ويشمل المشروع مرحله اوليّه سيتم خلالها بناء خط انابيب لنقل المياه طوله 180 كم من محطه تحليه المياه في ميناء العقبه الاردني الموجود على الساحل الشمالي الشرقي للبحر الاحمر الى البحر الميت.\nويهدف المشروع الى منع تدهور وانكماش البحر الميت وتوصيل المياه النقيه الى الاردنيين والفلسطينيين والاسرائيليين. ويعاني الاردن خصيصًا مؤخرًا من تداعيات نقص المياه بسبب زياده عدد السكان في ظل استمرار تدفق اللاجئين من سوريا. وقد اعلن البنك الدولي ان البرنامج التجريبي قابل للتطبيق بتكلفه 10 مليارات دولار امريكي، لكنه حذر وكذلك المنظمات البيئيه من العديد من المخاوف البيئيه المتعلقه بالمشروع.\n\nالتاريخ\nنالت منطقه سدوم وعموره اهميه لاهوتيه في كتابات الكثير من الباحثين ما بين الوصف كما في كتابات الرحاله العرب وغيرهم، واتباع منهجيه علميه في الدراسه عند بعض الباحثين ساهمت في تسليط بعض الضوء على حادثه الخسف الشهيره التي عمت منطقه الحوض الجنوبي للبحر الميت. كما اكد الكثير من العلماء ان مكان الخسف قد تم في مكان الحوض الجنوبي للبحر الميت الحالي، وبان المدن التي ذكرت في القران، والتوراه كانت موجوده في مكان الحوض الجنوبي، وان الخسف الذي حدث في الالف الثاني قبل الميلاد قد دمّر المدن ومن سكنها. وقد استبعد بعضهم ان البحر الميت قد تكون في تلك الفتره فقد كان موجودا قبل حادثه الخسف. وقد اكدت بعض الدارسات ان البحر الميت قد تشكّل بعد تكون عده بحيرات سبقت مرحله البحر الميت الحالي، وان بعض هذه البحيرات كانت ذات مياه عذبه.\nولقد اتفق العلماء على ان منخفض البحر الميت قد شغله عده بحيرات سبقت تشكل البحر الميت الحالي وهي بحيره اصدام، بحيره السمره، بحيره اللسان، وبحيره داميه، والبحر الميت الحالي.\nفعندما بدا تشكل منخفض الاغوار، كانت الجبال الشرقيه متصله مع الجبال الغربيه. وعندها بدا منخفض الاغوار بالتشكل بالحركه الافقيه او العموديه كما اشار العديد من العلماء. ومهما يكن الامر فقد انفرج منخفض الاغوار على شكل احواض واسعه لكنها لم تكن عميقه، ويبدو انه كان متصلا مع البحر المتوسط. ومع توالي عمليه الانخفاض انقطع الاتصال ما بين البحر المتوسط ومنخفض البحر الميت. وينقطع بذلك اتصال البحر المتوسط مع الاغوار والذي زوّدها بالمياه فترات زمنيه طويله نسبيا. واصبح مصدر المياه التي تغذي منطقه الاغوار يعتمد بشكل مباشر على مياه الامطار.\nوقد تعرضت تلك البحيرات خلال تاريخها الطويل الى اختلاف من حيث الانخفاض عن مستوى سطح البحر والامتداد الافقي وملوحه المياه. وكان تعتمد بشكل مباشر على رطوبه الجو ومعدلات الامطار، حيث كانت تسود المنطقه فترات من الجفاف تليها فترات انتقاليه ثم فترات رطبه مما يؤدي الى جفاف تلك الاجسام المائيه او الامتلاء في الفترات الرطبه. وتشير المصادر الجيولوجيه الى ان بحيره السمره نتجت عن فتره رطوبه رافقها ازدياد كبير في معدلات الامطار وانها ترافقت مع احدى العصور الجليديه الى سادت الارض وكانت ذات مياه عذبه. اما بحيره اللسان فقد كانت مياهها عذبه احيانًا ومالحه في احيان اخرى حسب رطوبه الجو. وهي اكبر المسطحات المائيه التي شغلت منخفض الاغوار حيث وصل طولها الى 220 كم.\n\nومع نهايه بحيره اللسان حدثت فتره جفاف قبل 14 الف سنه، والتي ادت الى جفاف معظم المسطحات المائيه في منطقه الاغوار وهي متطابقه مع اخر عصر جليدي في فتره بحيره داميه. ومع نهايه بحيره داميه تشكّل البحر الميت الحالي قبل 11 الف سنه، وقد كان مستوى سطحه يتعرض الى تذبذب سببه الظروف الطبيعيه الناتجه عن التقلبات المناخيه الى ان تحول التقلب في مستوى سطح البحر الميت الى عوامل بشريه ناتجه عن تحويل مصادر تغذيه البحر الميت بالمياه واهمها نهر الاردن، واقامه السدود المائيه على الاوديه التي ترفد البحر الميت بالمياه حتى انخفضت كميه المياه الوارده الى البحر الميت من 1200 مليون متر مكعب قبل عام 1960 الى اقل من 300 مليون متر مكعب في الوقت الراهن.\nوقد وُصف البحر الميت في الكثير من الخرائط والمواقع الدينيه اليهوديه والمسيحيه، حيث تُعد خارطه مادبا الفسيفسائيه اهم تلك الخرائط. وهي جزء من ارضيه لكنيسه قديمه في مدينه مادبا في الاردن، تعود الى العصر البيزنطي. وهي اقدم خريطه اصليه للاراضي المقدسه، والتي يعود انشاؤها الى سنه 560. توجد اليوم داخل كنيسه القديس جوارجيوس في مدينه مادبا، والتي بُنيت في عام 1896 فوق بقايا الكنيسه البيزنطيه. تمتد خريطه مادبا على جزء من ارضيه الكنيسه، وتُقدر ابعادها بنحو 15.75 عرضا 5.60 طولا، وتشكل مدينه القدس مركزا لها. وتظهر فيها مواقع في فلسطين والاردن وسوريا ولبنان ومصر.\nوتوجد على شواطئ البحر الميت منطقه تاريخيه مهمه، هي خربه قمران، وهي موقع اثري صغير الحجم، يقع على مقربه بضع كيلو مترات جنوبي اريحا في فلسطين. اكتسب شهرته العالميه بسب عثور مخطوطات البحر الميت فيه، وقبل العثور على المخطوطات لم يكن معروفاً الا عند القليل من علماء الاثار. وكانت اول زياره للموقع من قبل علماء الاثار في اواخر القرن العشرين. وقد بدات الحفريات هناك في عام 1950، وكانت عباره عن تنقيبات تجريبيه. وتضم هذه المخطوطات مايزيد على 970 قطعه مخطوطه، بعضها مما سمي لاحقا الكتاب المقدس وبعضها من كُتب لم تكن تعرف او كانت مفقوده. اول من عثر عليها راعيان من بدو التعامره المتجولين، كما تم اكتشاف المزيد بين عامي 1947 و1956 في 11 كهفًا في وادي قمران. وقد اثارت المخطوطات اهتمام الباحثين والمختصين بدراسه نص العهد القديم لانها تعود لما بين القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد والقرن الاول منه.\n\nاستكشاف البحر\nبدا الاهتمام الغربي باستكشاف نهر الاردن والبحر الميت في اواسط القرن التاسع عشر، وذلك من خلال بعثه امريكيه برئاسه الضابط وليم فرانسيس لنش، الذي زار المنطقه في عام 1848 لاهداف اقتصاديه وعلميه ودينيه. وتنبع اهميه هذه البعثه من كونها اول بعثه امريكيه ناجحه ارسلت الى حوض الاردن والبحر الميت، حيث ابدى لنش اهتمامًا واضحًا بالمنطقه، وذلك بدراسه امكانياتها المائيه والمعدنيه، كما دعى الى توطين اليهود في الاردن وفلسطين، قبل اكثر من قرن ونصف.\nلم تكن بعثه لنش البعثه الغربيه الاولى الى منطقه نهر الاردن والبحر الميت، حيث زار الايرلندي كرستوفر كوستغان وادي الاردن في عام 1835، لكنه مات بعد دخوله البحر الميت. وقبل مجيء لنش بقليل، وتحديداً في عام 1847، زار الانجليزي توماس مولينكس، من البحريه الملكيه البريطانيه المنطقه، لاستكشاف البحر الميت، لكنه مات بعد اسبوعين من اتمام مهمته. ويظهر ان لنش كان مدركاً للصعوبات والاخطار التي مر بها سابقوه، لذلك نزل في مدينه عكا على الشاطئ الشمالي لفلسطين في 4 نيسان/ ابريل 1848، حيث احاط السكان المحليون بالبعثه الامريكيه، وقطع بعدها لنش ورفاقه مسافه 25 ميلاً من شاطئ البحر المتوسط عبر الجليل في خمسه ايام.\n\nبدا لنش رحلته من بحيره طبريا عبر نهر الاردن الى البحر الميت. حيث استغرقت الرحله ثلاثه شهور (نيسان - حزيران 1848). وبعد وصول لنش للبحر الميت في نيسان 1848، اثّرت طبيعه التربه ومنظرها العام في نفسه سلبًا، على الاهتمامات المستقبيه للمنطقه، فالملح الخارج عن البحر الميت مغطيًا الحجاره، وطبيعه النباتات في المنطقه تشكّل نقاطاً لتساؤلات مفيده. كما راى ان المساحات المحيطه بوادي الاردن وخاصه على الجانب الشرقي منه كانت جافه وصلبه. وخلال جوله لنش في البحر الميت التي استمرت ثلاثه اسابيع رسم بعض الخرائط لشواطئ البحر، واستكشف المرتفعات المحيطه به.\nمن جانب اخر، اكتشف العلماء مؤخرًا العشرات من ينابيع المياه العذبه على طول ساحل البحر الميت وعلى عمق من 30 - 100 قدم تحت قعر البحر. اهميه هذا الاكتشاف تنبع في فهم اكثر للتوازن البيئي للبحر الميت. وقد وجد العلماء العديد من الحفر كل منها بعرض حوالي 10 امتار في الجزء السفلي للبحيره، وهي مغطاه بطبقه رقيقه وغريبه من انواع بكتيريه جديده.\n\nاهميه دينيه\nارتبط البحر الميت تاريخيّا بقصه قوم لوط التي ذُكرت كثيرًا في الكتب السماويه. ولوط هو ابن اخ النبي ابراهيم. هاجر لوط وابراهيم من العراق الى الشام في القرن التاسع عشر قبل الميلاد. وقوم لوط هم من اصل عربي قحطاني اصولهم تعود الى الجزيره العربيه، سكنوا منطقه جنوب البحر الميت بعد الهجره العربيه الاولى التي خرجت من الجزيره العربيه باتجاه الشمال، وتحديدًا بلاد الشام.\nوكان هؤلاء القوم معروفين بممارسه اللواط. وقد ذكرت الكتب السماويه قصتهم بعد ان سئم لوط منهم ويئس من هدايتهم، فتعرضوا لعذاب ادى الى تدمير قراهم الخمس عن بكره ابيها. ووردت قصتهم في القران سبعه وعشرين مره في 14 سوره مختلفه.\nولقد ورد البحر الميت في الانجيل تحت مُسمّيات مختلفه مثل «بحر الملح» و«بحر العربه» و«البحر الشرقي» وغيرها. كما وردت قصه لوط في التوراه في عده مواضع من سفر التكوين.\n\nالحياه البريه\nتتميز مناطق غور الاردن (من بحيره الحوله جنوباً الى جنوب البحر الميت) عن غيرها بالمناخ شبه المداري وقله حدوث الصقيع، مما يسمح لنباتات استوائيه وشبه استوائيه بالنمو. اُدخلت نباتات مثل النخيل والموز والحمضيات. من امثله النباتات البريه في هذه المناطق الغاب العملاق في مناطق المجاري المائيه والوديان. تتميز منطقه النقب ببعض الانواع التي تعد امتداداً للغطاء النباتي في افريقيا. من هذه الانواع العشار الباسق (باللاتينيه: Calotropis procera) واربعه انواع من السنط احدها السنط الملتوي (باللاتينيه: Acacia tortilis). وتشتهر منطقه البحر الميت باحتوائها على نمط النباتات الملحي، والذي ينتشر ايضًا حول واحات الازرق، وغور الاردن. وتختلف نباتات هذه المناطق باختلاف درجه ملوحتها وبالتالي قدره النبات على تحمل الملوحه. ومن نباتات هذا النمط الغرقد والاثل. كما تحوي المنطقه على نمط الغابات الاستوائي، ومعظم الغطاء النباتي في هذا النمط قد تعرض للتدمير بسبب انتشار الزراعه المكثف. وتعتبر نباتات السدر والطلح من اهم نباتات هذا النمط.\n\nكذلك، توجد اجناس نباتيه تتواجد في معظم البيئات الشاميه المذكوره اعلاه مثل السوسن الذي ينتشر منه اكثر من ثلاثين نوعًا تتوزع على مختلف مناطق الشام حسب تاقلم كل نوع منها. كذلك ينتشر اكثر من خمسين نوعًا من جنس الثوم (الفصيله الثوميه) واربعين من القنطريون (الفصيله النجميه) في مناطق الشام المختلفه من مرعش الى سيناء. هناك ايضًا اكثر من ستين نوعًا من جنس السيلينه من الفصيله القرنفليه تنتشر في مختلف المناطق وسبعه وثلاثون نوعا من الاربيان من الفصيله النجميه. وينتشر ايضًا في هذه المنطقه نبات قتاد البحر الميت، وهو نوع نباتي عشبي من جنس القتاد.\nويقع على الجانبين الشرقي والغربي من البحر الميت عدد من المحميات الطبيعيه التي تحوي تنوعًا كبيرًا في الكائنات الحيه المختلفه. وتُعد محميه الموجب الممتده بين محافظه مادبا ومحافظه الكرك في الاردن من اهم تلك المحميات، حيث يعيش فيها العديد من الحيوانات البريه مثل الماعز الجبلي وهو نوع من الماعز، الغزال الجبلي، الذئب، الوبر، والضبع المخططه، والقطط البريه مثل الوشق النادر الوجود في الاردن والنموس وغيرها. كما توجد في المحميه انواع كثيره من الطيور بلغ عدد انواعها اكثر من 150 من بين المحليه والمهاجره منها الشنار والسفرج والقبره المتوجه والابلق الحزين والسواديه والبلبل والغراب المروحي الذنب مثل الرخمه المصريه، وعقاب الباديه والعويسق وعقاب بونيللي.\n\nالسكان\nتشير المصادر التاريخيه، الى ان تاريخ الاستيطان البشري في منطقه البحر الميت وتحديدًا الجزء الجنوبي منه يمتد الى الالف الثالث قبل الميلاد. حيث كان مركزا حضاريًا في الفتره التاريخيه من 3300 ق.م الى 2300 ق م. وقد اُستدل على ذلك من خلال الحفريات التي اُجريت في منطقه غور المزرعه، وتحديدًا باب الذراع، حيث عُثر هنالك على اكبر مقبره في الشرق القديم والتي يعود تاريخها الى اقدم من خمسه الاف عام في العصر البرونزي المبكر. وفي الالف الثاني قبل الميلاد، وتحديدًا في 1900 ق. م. كانت منطقه الحوض الجنوبي تعج بالحضاره، وهي الفتره ذاتها التي عاش فيها لوط حسب معظم المصادر التاريخيه. وكان فيها خمسه مدن مزدهره هي: سدوم، عموره، زغر، ادمه، وصوبيم. وشهدت في تلك المرحله خسف ودمار لتلك الحضارات. وقد تم الاستشهاد بما نزل من ايات القران، وبعض الكتب المقدسه واراء الكثير من المفسرين وربط ذلك مع التاريخ الجيولوجي لمنطقه البحر الميت.\nالمجتمع المحلي\n\nيعيش اليوم على الجانب الشرقي من البحر الميت حوالي 70,000 نسمه، يتركز معظمهم في بلدات فيفا وغور الصافي ومدينه البوتاس والكفرين. بالاضافه الى الالاف من الذين يعملون في الصناعه والسياحه في محافظتي الكرك ومادبا. يوجد في منطقه غور الصافي نشاط زراعي واسع، حيث يجذب بعض العماله. ويتركز النشاط السياحي في الجزء الشمالي الشرقي حيث تتركز الفنادق الاردنيه. ويعمل في هذا القطاع حوالي 20 ٪ من المشتغلين في تلك المنطقه. كما توظف المصانع الكيماويه حوالي 20 ٪ منهم، اما الباقي فيعمل في قطاع الخدمات. وتخضع المنطقه الشرقيه للبحر الميت لسلطه وادي الاردن.\nويشكل لواء الاغوار الجنوبيه التابع لمحافظه الكرك الاردنيه جزءاً كبيرًا من هذه المنطقه، والذي يتجاوز عدد سكانه المقيمين اقامه دائمه 49,000 نسمه حسب احصائيات دائره الاحوال المدنيه والجوازاتفي الاردن للعام 2008. وهم يعتمدون على الزراعه بالدرجه الاولى بحكم الطبيعه الجغرافيه للمنطقه. ويُقدر عدد العاملين في هذا القطاع بحوالي 60% من السكان ذكورًا واناثًا. وتعد الصافي من اكبر التجمعات السكانيه.\nاما على الجانب الغربي، فيعيش في المنطقه الشماليه الغربيه، وتحديدًا بالقرب من اريحا وضواحيها 25,000 نسمه. ويعمل سكان هذه المنطقه بشكل اساسي في الزراعه والخدمات. كما يوجد عدد من المستوطنات الاسرائيليه على هذا الجانب يسكنها حوالي 2,500 نسمه، وتديرها المجالس الاقليميه المحليه، ويبلغ عدد هذه المستوطنات 12 مستوطن وتجمع سكني. هذا بالاضافه الى البدو الذين ياتون في كل يوم لمنطقه اريحا من عراد والقدس وديمونه وبئر السبع. تشغل السياحه الجزء الاكبر من عمل الموظفين في الجزء الغربي من البحر الميت، حيث يعمل فيها حوالي 5,000 موظف. اما الباقي، فيعملون في الزراعه والخدمات.\n\nالاقتصاد\nبدا البحر الميت في بدايات القرن العشرين بجذب اهتمام الكيميائيين الذين استنتجوا بدورهم ان البحر يحوي ثروات طبيعيه مهوله من البوتاس (كلوريد البوتاسيوم) والبروم. لذا، قامت شركه البوتاس الفلسطينيه في عام 1929 بتاسيس اول مصنع ينتج البوتاس في الساحل الشمالي للبحر الميت، حيث كان الانتاج يتم عبر التبخير الشمسي في المحاليل المائيه. وكان يعمل في المصنع عمّال عرب ويهود، حيث كان كواحه سلام في اوقات عصيبه. وفي عام 1934 قامت الشركه بتاسيس مصنعها الثاني في الساحل الجنوبي قرب جبل سدوم، الا انها تضررت كثيرًا بفعل احداث النكبه عام 1948.\nتم اغلاق المصنع الواقع في شمال البحر الميت في الضفه الغربيه بعد حرب 1948، وقد تم تفكيكه من قبل عصابه البالماخ الصهيونيه قبل انسحابها. كما تمت اعاده تشغيل العمليات في مصنع سدوم بالجنوب في عام 1952، والذي استمر حتى وقتنا الحاضر. لقد استولت اسرائيل على بقايا شركه البوتاس الفلسطينيه المحدوده بعد تاسيسها، وقد تم تاسيس شركه اخرى بدلاً عنها مملوكه للدوله في عام 1952 لاستخراج البوتاس وغيره من المعادن من البحر الميت. وقد تمت خصخصه الشركه في عام 1995، وهي مملوكه حاليًا لشركه كيماويات اسرائيل.\nيمتد الساحل الفلسطيني على البحر الميت في الضفه الغربيه بحوالي 40 كم، الا ان الاقتصاد الفلسطيني لا يستفيد من الصناعات الكيماويه في البحر الميت بسبب اجراءات الاحتلال الاسرائيلي والمناطق المغلقه التي فرضتها اسرائيل بعد احتلالها للضفه الغربيه عام 1967. وتشير تقديرات البنك الدولي الى ان صناعه المواد الكيميائيه الفلسطينيه من البحر الميت يمكن ان تولد 918 مليون دولار للقيمه المضافه سنويًا، اي ما يعادل تقريبا كل مساهمه قطاع الصناعات التحويليه في الاراضي الفلسطينيه اليوم. كما تشير تقديرات البنك الدولي الى ان صناعه السياحه الفلسطينيه بالبحر الميت يمكن ان تولد 290 مليون دولار من العائدات سنوياً و2900 فرصه عمل. ومع ذلك، فان الفلسطينيون لا يستطيعون الحصول على تصاريح البناء للاستثمارات ذات الصله بالسياحه على البحر الميت بسب اجراءات الاحتلال الاسرائيلي. ويُعتبر البحر الميت ذخرًا استراتيجيًا للاقتصاد الفلسطيني، لما يحتويه على كميات من الاملاح والمعادن ذات القيمه العاليه، والتي تستولي عليها اسرائيل باستخراجها وبيعها، وتمنع اي نشاط اقتصادي فلسطيني في تلك المنطقه. وتُقدر الخسائر السنويه للاقتصاد الفلسطيني نتيجه عدم استغلاله لموارد البحر الميت بنحو 1.1 مليار دولار اي ما يعادل 13.6% من الناتج المحلي الاجمالي.\n\nاما على الجانب الاردني من البحر الميت، فقد تم تاسيس شركه البوتاس العربيه في عام 1956، والتي تنتج حوالي مليوني طن من البوتاس سنويًا، بالاضافه الى كلوريد الصوديوم والبرومين. يقع المصنع في غور الصافي، في لواء الاغوار الجنوبيه بمحافظه الكرك. ويجني الاردن من الصناعات المعدنيه في البحر الميت حوالي 1.2 مليار دولار (تعدال 4% من الدخل القومي للمملكه). ويقع على الشاطئ الاردني حوالي 5 فنادق كبرى مصنفه كخمسه او اربعه نجوم، ادخلت عوائد للمملكه في عام 2012 بحوالي 128 مليون دولار. وقد زار بانوراما البحر الميت 12 الف زائر في عام 2013.\nوقد بدا الاردن بانشاء منطقه البحر الميت التنمويه على بعد 55 كم من العاصمه عمّان لتقديم الفرص الاستثماريه لتطوير العقارات. تمتد المنطقه على حوالي 40 كم مربع على شواطئ الساحلين الشمالي والشرقي للبحر الميت، وتحيط بها الجبال والتضاريس المنحدره الى شرق وادي نهر الاردن الى الشمال. تتمتع المنطقه ببنى تحتيه جيده، وتتصل مع عمّان من خلال الطريق السريع الرئيسي اضافه الى اماكن الجذب السياحي. وتتركز الفرص الاستثماريه في قطاع السياحه والفندقه بتطوير فنادق دوليه من فئه خدمات اربع وخمس نجوم، وتطوير فنادق من فئه 3 نجوم، والمرافق والمنشات البيئيه والمجمعات السكنيه والخدمات المجتمعيه والمرافق الترفيهيه والمنتجعات والمطاعم ومراكز المؤتمرات والمعارض.\nاما بالنسبه لاسرائيل، فقد انتجت من المحلول الملحي للبحر الميت في عام 2001، حوالي 1,7 مليون طن من البوتاس، وحوالي 206,000 طن من البرومين، و44,900 طن من الصودا الكاويه، وحوالي 25,000 طن من معادن المغنيسيوم، وكلوريد الصوديوم. وتجني الشركات الاسرائيليه حوالي 3 مليارات دولار سنوياً من بيع معادن البحر الميت (في المقام الاول البوتاس والبروم) وغيرها من المنتجات المستمده من معادن البحر الميت. وتملك اسرائيل 15 فندقًا على طول ساحل البحر الميت الغربي. وكان لهذه الفنادق عوائد على الاقتصاد الاسرائيلي بلغت في عام 2012 حوالي 291 مليون دولار. معظم تلك الفنادق توجد في الجزء الجنوبي من الساحل الغربي.\n\nالسياحه\nتُعد منطقه البحر الميت من اهم المناطق السياحيه للاستشفاء البيئي على مستوى العالم، حيث تتميز بمجموعه من العوامل الطبيعيه ما جعلها تحظى بمركز تنافسي في المنطقه في مجال السياحه العلاجيه والاستشفاء نظرًا لما يتمتع به من خصائص مناخيه فريده سواءً بخلوّه من الرطوبه، وباحتوائه على عيون كبريتيه جعلته مؤهلاً لعلاج العديد من الامراض وخاصه الجلديه منها، والتي تنتشر بصوره كبيره، حيث يصل عدد المصابين بها في اوروبا الى 25 مليون مريض، اضافهً الى علاج الروماتويد، وبذلك امتلكت منطقه البحر الميت عناصر مهمه للجذب السياحي ليس فقط في سياحه الاستشفاء، ولكن بتميزه ايضًا في سياحه الترفيه والسياحه البيئيه. ان اختيار منطقه البحر الميت من خلال منظمه الصحه العالميه كمركز عالمي لعلاج الكثير من الامراض الجلديه في عام 2011، يدل على اهميه المنطقه في مجال السياحه العلاجيه. وتعتمد العديد من الفنادق المقامه على ساحل البحر الميت على تقديم العلاج الطبيعي القائم على الاستفاده من الخصائص الطبيعيه المميزه للمنطقه دون استخدام اي ادويه كيماويه على الاطلاق. وتؤكد العديد من الدراسات ان منطقه البحر الميت بامتلاكها هذه المزايا العلاجيه يمكنها تحقيق اكبر عائد مادي سياحي للاردن، حيث ان نسبه الاصابه بالامراض الجلديه يتراوح ما بين 1 : 3% من تعداد السكان.\nكما شهدت سياحه المؤتمرات في البحر الميت تطورًا ملحوظًا خلال الاونه الاخيره، واصبحت منطقه البحر الميت تختص بهذا النوع من السياحه، من خلال تنظيم المؤتمرات والندوات واللقاءات على كافه المستويات المحليه والاقليميه والعالميه، حيث تتولى جهات مختصه مهمه تنظيم هذه اللقاءات والمؤتمرات وتوفير خدمات لا تقتصر على الجانب الرسمي للمؤتمر، وانما تشتمل ايضًا على تقديم الخدمات السياحيه والترفيهيه للمشاركين. وقد قام الاردن بتاسيس شركه البحر الميت للمؤتمرات والمعارض في عام 2003 بمشاركه مجموعه من المستثمرين الاردنيين والعرب. فكانت باكوره مشاريع هذه الشركه هو انشاء مركز الملك الحسين بن طلال للمؤتمرات لاستضافه اهم الفعاليات والمؤتمرات الاقليميه والعالميه. ولقد ساهم هذا المشروع في وضع الاردن على الخارطه العالميه لملتقيات رجال الاعمال والاستثمار، حيث استضاف المركز المنتدى الاقتصادي العالمي لاكثر من مره.\nوينظّم الاردن سنويًا ماراثوناً للركض في البحر الميت بمشاركه الالاف من المواطنين والسيّاح انطلاقا من عمّان وانتهاءً بشاطئ عمّان السياحي المطل على البحر الميت. ويُقام هذا الحدث لدعم مرضى الدماغ والاعصاب في المملكه.\n\nكما تنتج مختبرات البحر الميت الكثير من مستحضرات التجميل المصنوعه من المعادن المستخرجه من طينه، حيث تتوفر في الاسواق في انحاء الاردن، او يمكن طلبها عبر شبكه الانترنت فيتم تسليمها الى اي مكان في العالم، لكي يتمكن الزوار من الاستمرار بالتمتع بفوائد البحر الميت، بعد عودتهم الى ديارهم بفتره طويله.\nمن جهه اخرى، خصصت الحكومه الاسرائيليه في 2012 مبلغ 220 مليون دولار لما اسمته «تطوير وتاهيل البحر الميت». وستغطي معظم الموازنه تطوير المنطقتين السياحيتين على البحر الميت والمسماتين «تامي زوهر» و«عين بوقيق» وما بينهما، فضلا عن تاهيل ومعالجه المناطق والبنى التحتيه التي تضررت او التي يخيم عليها الخطر. وعند انجاز المشروع، تتوقع الحكومه الاسرائيليه ان يرتفع عدد الغرف الفندقيه المعروضه من 4000 الى 6500. ويهدف المشروع الاسرائيلي، بشكل اساسي، الى تحويل البحر الميت الى احد المواقع السياحيه الرائده في العالم؛ وهو لا يمس من قريب او بعيد مشكله استنزاف المصانع الاسرائيليه للموارد الملحيه الطبيعيه في البحر، علما بان المصانع الاسرائيليه تستنزف سنويًا اكثر من 250 مليون متر مكعب من مياه البحر الميت.\n\nفي الثقافه الانسانيه\nعُرف البحر الميت في الكثير من ثقافات وحضارات شعوب المنطقه. وكان الفراعنه اول من التفت الى اهميته، وتحديدًا الملكه كليوباترا، فهي اول من اكتشف املاحه وخصائصه الشفائيه والعلاجيه للبشره وشدّ العظام والجلد وتنشيط الدوره الدمويه ومقاومه التجاعيد. كما كان حمام الطين احد وصفاتها للجمال، حيث كانت تصنع ذلك الحمام من الطين الماخوذ من البحر الميت، والذي اشتهر باحتوائه بوفره على المعادن التي تغذي البشره وتنشطها وتسهم في نعومتها وبريقها.\n\nوقد وُصف البحر الميت في الكثير من اللوحات الفنيه العالميه، كلوحه الفنان المجري تيفادار اثناء زيارته لفلسطين عام 1906، حيث ظهرت فيها مدينه القدس ومن خلفها البحر الميت. كما ذُكر البحر في عدد من الاعمال الادبيه، سواءً المحليه او العالميه. وتُعد قصيده «حجر كنعاني في البحر الميت» للشاعر الفلسطيني محمود درويش احد اهم تلك الاعمال الادبيه. من جهه اخرى، تُعد «قصائد البحر الميت» التي كتبها الشاعر الانجليزي سيمون ارميتاج من الاعمال الادبيه الغربيه المهمه في هذا الخصوص. وقد استوحاها من النتائج التي توصل اليها علماء الاثار من مخطوطات البحر الميت، والتي اكتشفها راعي ماعز في عام 1947، كما عكست تجارب الشاعر وتجذرها في حياته الخاصه. وتتكون القصيده من 11 موشحه، معظمها يتكون من 3 اسطر، ويتكون المقطع الشعري الاخير من مجرد نصف سطر.\n\nانظر ايضًا\nقائمه اماكن حسب انخفاضها تحت مستوى البحر\nالبحيره المالحه الكبرى\nبحيره طبريا\nبحيره الحوله\nبحيره عسل\nاكتوبوس

      "summary": "البحر الميت هو بحيرة ملحية مغلقة تقع في أخدود وادي الأردن ضمن الشق السوري الأفريقي، على خط الحدود الفاصل بين الأردن وفلسطين التاريخية (الضفة الغربية والداخل المحتل). يشتهر البحر الميت بأنه أخفض نقطة على سطح الكرة الأرضية، حيث بلغ منسوب شاطئه حوالي 400 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر حسب سجلات عام 2013. كما يتميز البحر الميت بشدة ملوحته، إذ تبلغ نسبة الأملاح فيه حوالي 34%، وهي ما تمثل تسعة أضعاف تركيز الأملاح في البحر المتوسط، وواحدة من أعلى نسب الملوحة بالمسطحات المائية في العالم. وقد نتجت هذه الأملاح لأن البحيرة هي وجهة نهائية للمياه التي تصب فيه، حيث أنه لا يوجد أي مخرج لها بعده.\nيصل عرض البحر الميت في أقصى حد إلى 17 كم، بينما يبلغ طوله حوالي 70 كم. وقد بلغت مساحته في عام 2010 حوالي 650 كم2 إذ تقلصت خلال الأربع عقود الماضية بما يزيد عن 35%. كما يلعب المناخ الصحراوي للمنطقة الذي يمتاز بشدة الحرارة والجفاف ومعدلات التبخر العالية دورًا كبيرًا في زيادة تركيز تلك الأملاح فيه.\nلقد عانى منسوب البحر الميت مؤخرًا من التراجع المستمر، حيث يرجع هذا الأمر إلى عدد من الأسباب الرئيسية، كالاستخدام المكثف لمصادر المياه، وأهمها نهر الأردن، وضخ المياه في الحوض الجنوبي، حيث يتكون البحر الميت حاليًا من حوضين؛ شمالي وجنوبي يقسمهما شبه جزيرة اللسان. ونتيجة للانخفاض المستمر لهذا المستوى، تعرض الجزء الجنوبي من البحيرة للجفاف، حيث إنّ الجزء الجنوبي أقل عمقًا من نظيره الشمالي، ويصل ارتفاع منسوب شاطئه إلى 401 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر. ومع تجفيف الجزء الجنوبي، تم إنشاء برك لتبخير المياه وإنتاج البوتاس والمواد الكيماوية الأخرى مثل المنجنيز والمغنسيوم والبرومين في مصانع البوتاس الإسرائيلية، وشركة البوتاس العربية في الأردن. وتحتاج تلك البرك إلى ضخ كبير من مياه البحر الميت وتبخيرها، مما أثّر تأثيرًا كبيرًا على زيادة انخفاض مستوى سطح البحر.\nلقد بلغ المعدل السنوي لانخفاض مستوى سطح البحر خلال العقد المنصرم بمقدار يعادل الفقدان لمدة سنة كاملة، حيث أصبح المستوى ينخفض حوالي متر واحد كل عام. ولقد زاد هذا المعدل في عام 2012 بشكل واضح، فكان انخفاض مستوى البحر 1.40 متر. وقد أدى الانخفاض التراكمي في مستوى المياه إلى تغيرات كبيرة أيضا في تضاريس المناطق المجاورة وفي البحر الأبيض المتوسط بما في ذلك تغيرات لا يمكن الرجوع عنها في الجزء الشمالي، من خلق للمجاري، والانسحاب من الشواطئ، والأضرار التي لحقت بالبنية التحتية (الطرق والجسور) والمحميات الطبيعية.\nيُعد البحر الميت مهماً جدًا للصناعة والسياحة في المنطقة، حيث تُعتبر تركيبة مياهه مختلفة عن المياه الطبيعية، باحتوائها على تركيز عالي من الكالسيوم والبوتاسيوم. ويُستغل هذا في مصانع الجانبين الأردني والإسرائيلي. وترجع الأهمية التاريخية والسياحية لمنطقة حوض البحر الميت إلى البحر نفسه وإلى شواطئه، حيث توجد بعض المعالم الأثرية والدينية الهامة في المنطقة مثل مسعدة، وخربة قمران، وكهف النبي لوط، بالإضافة إلى التشكيلات الملحية الطبيعية، والمناخ السائد فيه، فكلها جعلت من البحر الميت نقطة جذب سياحية عالمية، وخصوصًا فيما يتعلق بالسياحة العلاجية. وتحوي المنطقة على آلاف الغرف الفندقية، حيث تتركز في الجزء الشمالي الشرقي في الأردن، بالإضافة إلى الجزء الغربي المطل على الحوض الجنوبي. وقد رُشح ليكون أحد عجائب الدنيا السبع الطبيعية في نطاق البحيرات.\nورغم أن دولة فلسطين لها جزء يطل على البحر الميت إلا أن السلطات الإسرائيلية لا تسمح للفلسطينيين باستغلال مواردهم من البحر، بل تمنعهم تماما من الذهاب إلى ساحل البحر الميت بحجة الأمن. وتشكل حقوق الفلسطينيين في استغلال نصيبهم من البحر الميت نقطة هامة في مباحثات السلام، بالإضافة إلى حقوقهم في مياه الشرب.",
