      "content": "Constantine (Arabic: قسنطينة, romanized: Qusanṭīnah), also spelled Qacentina or Kasantina, is the capital of Constantine Province in northeastern Algeria. During Roman times it was called Cirta and was renamed \"Constantina\" in honour of Emperor Constantine the Great. Located somewhat inland, Constantine is about 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the Mediterranean coast, on the banks of the Rhumel River.\nConstantine is regarded as the capital of eastern Algeria and the commercial centre of its region and has a population of about 450,000 (938,475 with the agglomeration), making it the third largest city in the country after Algiers and Oran. There are several museums and historical sites located around the city. Constantine is often referred to as the \"City of Bridges\" because of the numerous picturesque bridges connecting the various hills, valleys, and ravines that the city is built on and around.\nConstantine was named the Arab Capital of Culture in 2015.\n\nHistory\nAncient history\nIn antiquity, the city was originally called Cirta and served as the capital of the Berber kingdom of Numidia. In 112 BC, the city was the capital of the Numidian king Jugurtha, who defeated his half-brother Adherbal. The city later served as the base for Roman generals Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus and Gaius Marius in their war against Jugurtha. Later, with the removal of King Juba I and the remaining supporters of Pompey in Africa (c. 46), Julius Caesar gave special rights to the citizens of Cirta, now known as Colonia Sittlanorum.\nIn 311 AD, during the civil war between emperor Maxentius and usurper Domitius Alexander (a former governor of Africa), the city was destroyed. Rebuilt in 313 AD, it was subsequently named in Latin as \"Colonia Constantiniana\" or \"Constantina\", after emperor Constantine the Great, who had defeated Maxentius. During Roman rule, the city exported wheat and was the only population center that lay on both of the Roman roads paved in ancient Algeria. Captured by the Vandals in 432, Constantine returned to the Byzantine Exarchate of Africa from 534 to 697. Following the Arab conquest of the city in the 8th century, it became known as Qacentina. The city was a part of the wider region of Ifriqiya.\n\nModern history\nThe city recovered in the 12th century and under Almohad and Hafsid rule it was again a prosperous market, with links to Pisa, Genoa and Venice. After taking it from the Hafsids in 1529 it was intermittently part of Ottoman Empire, ruled by a Turkish bey (governor) subordinate to the dey of Algiers. Salah Bey, who ruled the city in 1770–1792, greatly embellished it and built much of the Muslim architecture still visible today. During the Ottoman reign of Constantine, merchants traded a variety of goods such as; agricultural products, animals, embroidered textiles, leather, precious metals, swords, and pistols.\n\nIn 1826 the last bey, Ahmed Bey ben Mohamed Chérif, became the new head of state. He led a fierce resistance against French forces, which invaded Algeria four years later. By 13 October 1837, the territory was captured by France, and from 1848 on until 1962 it was the centre of the Constantine Département. In 1880, while working in the military hospital in Constantine, Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran discovered that the cause of malaria is a protozoan. He observed the parasites in a blood smear taken from a soldier who had just died of malaria. For this, he received the 1907 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. This was the first time that protozoa were shown to be a cause of disease. His work helped inspire researchers and veterinarians today to try to find a cure for malaria in animals.\nIn 1934, Muslim anti-Jewish riots, the 1934 Constantine Pogrom, caused the death of 23 local Jews and 3 local Muslims, 81 people were injured on both sides of the conflict.\nDuring World War II, during the campaign in North Africa (1942–43), Allied forces used Constantine and the nearby cities of Sétif and Bone as operational bases.\n\nGeography\nConstantine is situated on a plateau at an elevation 640 metres (2,100 ft) above sea level. The city is framed by a deep ravine and has a dramatic appearance. The city is very picturesque with a number of bridges over Rhumel River and a viaduct crossing the ravine. The ravine is crossed by seven bridges, including Sidi M'Cid bridge. Constantine is the railhead of a prosperous and diverse agricultural area. It is also a centre of the grain trade and has flour mills, a tractor factory, and industries producing textiles, wool, linen and leather goods. Algeria and Tunisia serve as its markets.\n\nClimate\nConstantine has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa), with hot, dry summers and mild, moist winters.\n\nMain sights\nThe city is framed by a deep ravine and has a dramatic appearance. In 1911, Baedeker described it as \"resembling the Kasba of Algiers, the picturesque charm of which has so far been marred by the construction of but a few new streets.\"\n\nEl Bey Mosque built in 1703 also known by its post colonial name Souq El Ghezal Mosque.\nGreat Mosque of Constantine historical mosque built in 1136.\nCirta Museum, previously Gustave Mercier Museum (displays ancient and modern Algerian art)\nAbd al Hamid Ben Badis Mosque\nThe Casbah (Kasbah) known locally by the name of Swika\nEmir Abdelkader University and Mosque\nSoumma Mausoleum\nMassinissa's Mausoleum\nMunicipal Library of Constantine\nAhmed Bey Palace\nRuins of the Antonian Roman aqueduct\nBen Abdelmalek Stadium\nNearby are\n\nthe Roman city of Tiddis\nthe megalithic monuments and burial grounds at Djebel Mazala Salluste.\n\nThe City of Bridges\nThe topography of the city is unique and it determines the need for bridges. At the end of the 19th century, Guy de Maupassant wrote: \"Eight bridges used to cross this ravine. Six of these bridges are in ruins today.\" Today the most important bridges are:\n\nSidi M'Cid Bridge (1912), a suspension bridge with a length of 168m,\nBab El Kantra Bridge (1792) bridge which leads toward north,\nSidi Rached bridge (1912), a long viaduct of 447ms and 27 arches, designed by Paul Séjourné,\nDevil's bridge, a tiny beam bridge,\nFalls bridge (1925), formed by a series of arches on top of a waterfall,\nMellah Slimane Bridge (1925), a suspension bridge,\nSalah Bey Bridge (Trans-Rhummel viaduct, 2014), the first cable-stayed bridge in Constantine, designed by Dissing+Weitling architecture,\nMeddjez Dechiche Bridge\n\nEducation\nConstantine has in general four universities: two of them are downtown Constantine Mentouri Public University, designed by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, and Algerian architect Rashid Hassaine, including Zerzara technical engineering pole, Zouaghi Slimane Geography and Earth Sciences Pole, and in the City of El-Khroub is the Institute of Veterinary Sciences. Emir Abdelkader University is one of the biggest Islamic universities with many faculties covering religious studies, foreign languages, and literature. Constantine's new town \"nouvelle ville ali mendjeli\" has two big universities: Université Constantine 2 known as \"lella nsoumer\" offers maths, computer and economy majors, and the new university is actually a university pole with more than 20,000 students, 17 faculties and more than 40,000 residents. It is now the largest African university under the name of \"Université Salah Boubnider\" known as \"Université Constantine 3\".\n\nTransport\nConstantine is served by Mohamed Boudiaf International Airport.\nConstantine also owns its 14.7 km-long tram network serving the city centre at the airport and the main neighbourhoods of the metropolis Constantine tramway.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nConstantine is twinned with:\n\nGrenoble, France\nSousse, Tunisia\n\nNotable people\nConstantine has been the hometown of many noteworthy people in Algeria and France.\n\nAbdelhamid Brahimi, former Prime Minister of Algeria (1984-1988)\nAbdelhamid Ben Badis, Islamic reformer and philosopher\nAbdelmalek Sellal, former Prime Minister of Algeria two terms (2012-2014),(2014-2017)\nAhmed Bey, last Bey of Constantine (1826-1848)\nAhlam Mosteghanemi, writer\nAlfred Nakache, Olympic champion swimmer and Holocaust survivor.\nAli Saïdi-Sief, Olympic medallist\nAmar Bentoumi, lawyer, Algerian independence activist, Algerian politician\nMalek Bennabi, philosopher\nRabah Bitat, third President of Algeria (1978)\nSabri Boukadoum, former Minister of foreign affairs and acting Prime Minister\nMouloud Hamrouche, former Prime Minister of Algeria (1989-1991)\nDjamel Eddine Laouisset, Algerian Scholar\nMasinissa, the first King of Numidia\nHassiba Boulmerka, athlete, first Algerian woman to win an Olympic title (1992)\nPrincess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois, daughter of Louis II, Prince of Monaco, and mother of Prince Rainier III\nRoger Chauviré (1880–1957), French writer\nClaude Cohen-Tannoudji, Nobel Prize winner in physics\nSidi Fredj Halimi, Chief Rabbi and rabbinical court president\nEnrico Macias, French singer\nCheb i Sabbah, DJ, musician and composer\nJean-Michel Atlan, artist\nAlphonse Halimi, world champion boxer\nKateb Yacine, writer\nMaurice Boitel, artist\nSandra Laoura, Olympic medallist\nMalek Haddad, poet\nMoussa Maaskri, actor\nFadéla M'rabet writer and feminist\nCherif Guellal, Algerian diplomat, first ambassador to the USA (1963-1967)\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nLaura Maravall Buckwalter. 2019. \"Factor endowments on the 'frontier': Algerian settler agriculture at the beginning of the 1900s.\" Economic History Review\n\nExternal links\n\nWorldStatesmen- Algeria\n\"Constantine (Cirta)\"—Catholic Encyclopedia\nThe Cascades, Constantine, Algeria\nImages of Constantine in Manar al-Athar digital heritage photo archive",
