It is the seventh-largest city in UAE, located on the Gulf of Oman (part of the Indian Ocean). It is the only Emirati capital city on the UAE's east coast. The city of Fujairah is an industrial and commercial hub located on the west coast of the Indian Ocean that sits at the foothills of the Hajar Mountains.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2016, the city had a population of 97,226, a significant number (43%) compared to 225,360 in the entire emirate. In 2023, the population grew to 118,933. Fujairah's population has grown steadily over the past few decades, driven by economic development, urbanization, and an increasing number of expatriates settling in the emirate. The native Emirati population in Fujairah is estimated to make up about 30-40% of the total population.\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Fujairah is characterized by a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), with very warm winters and extremely hot summers. In the summer months, daytime temperatures typically reach highs of around 41 °C (106 °F), while winter temperatures are milder, averaging around 25 °C (77 °F) .

Fujairah receives an average annual rainfall of about 120 mm (4.7 inches).\n2022 Floods in Fujairah:\n\nIn 2022, Fujairah experienced significant flooding due to heavy rains that occurred in July. This led to widespread damage in the emirate, affecting businesses and residents alike. The floods were part of a larger weather event that brought the highest recorded rainfall in nearly three decades. The damage was substantial, with traders in Fujairah reporting major losses. Additionally, the floods resulted in rescue operations for hundreds of people and the establishment of temporary shelters for those displaced by the flooding.\n\nCommercial\nFujairah City is the main business and commercial centre for the emirate, with tall office buildings lining Hamad Bin Abdulla Road, the main route into the city. The road runs through the city and connects Fujairah City to Dubai through the Emirate of Sharjah.

The northern part of the waterfront has many cylindrical tanks for oil storage.\nThe Fujairah Free Zone is a special economic zone located to the north of the city, which is subject to different economic regulations. Creative City is a media free zone on the Sheikh Khalifa Highway to the west.

The port is an oil hub and has launched plans to expand its oil storage capacity by 75% by 2022.\nThe Fujairah Oil Industry Zone (FOIZ) is located north of the Port of Fujairah and has a storage capacity of 10 million cubic meters for refined oil products. It was established to develop and regulate the hydrocarbon industry in the emirate of Fujairah and to support growth and investment in the sector. Eighteen companies operate in the FOIZ, and the Aramco Trading Company opened its second overseas office in the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone in 2019, the first one being in Singapore.\nThere are a number of shopping malls, including the large City Centre Fujairah mall, opened in 2012.

It can hold around 28,000 worshippers.\nThe Fujairah Museum opened its doors in 1991 and is home to archeological exhibits discovered in various parts of the emirate.
