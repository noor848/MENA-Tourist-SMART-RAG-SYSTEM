      "content": "Fujairah Fort (Arabic: قلعة الفجيرة) is a fort in the city of Fujairah, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Dating back to the 16th century, it is among the oldest as well as the largest castles in the country. Today, it is among the main tourist attractions in the city. It is one of the oldest forts in the UAE and was occupied by the Wahhabists.\n\nLocation\nThe fort is located about 2 km from central modern Fujairah in the old Fujairah region, on a small rocky hill which reaches 20 meters high. It is around 1 km away from the coast.\n\nArchitecture\nThe fort is part of a complex with several old houses and a mosque. It is guarded by three round watchtowers and a square watchtower. The watchtowers and main building are connected by the walls, and there is a central hall surrounded by these towers and wall. The irregular shape of the castle is due to the uneven surface of the rock it sits on. The building is built of local materials, mostly rocks, gravels, mud, hay and plasters. Radiocarbon dating has identified the date of the construction as around 1500–1550. It was one of many forts constructed in the area by the Portuguese and is one of the oldest in the UAE. It was then renovated during 1650–1700.\n\nHistory\nWahhabists occupied multiple forts across the eastern coast of the Arabian Pennusula, including Fujairah Fort, from 1808 to 1810, before being driven out by the locals. The fort was used as a prison up to the 1900s.\nThe British Navy destroyed three of the towers in 1925 during an action enforcing British anti-slavery policy. The bombardment was by HMIS Lawrence. After this incident the fort was abandoned and neglected until 1997.\n\nRestoration and Role Today\nThe fort was restored by the Fujairah Administration of Antiquity and Heritage during 1997/2000 using the same materials with which it was built.\n\nSee also\nFujairah Museum, nearby\nSakamkam Fort, to the north\n\nReferences\nWorks cited\nGhazal, Rym (10 December 2010). \"Fujairah Fort opens to public to reveal the pivotal role it played in nation's past\".
