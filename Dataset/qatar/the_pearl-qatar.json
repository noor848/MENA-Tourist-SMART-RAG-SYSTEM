It was the first land in Qatar to be available for freehold ownership by foreign nationals. As of 2018, there were 27,000 residents.\nOnce fully completed, The Pearl was expected to create over 32 kilometers of new coastline, for use as a residential estate with an expected 18,831 dwellings and 45,000 residents by 2018.\nIn 2004, when the project was first revealed, the initial cost of constructing the island stood at $2.5 billion. This figure was later revised to approximately $15 billion upon completion.\n\nResidential development\nResidential development on the island is intended to incorporate various national and international themes, including aspects of Arabic, Mediterranean, and European culture.
