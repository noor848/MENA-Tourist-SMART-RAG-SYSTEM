      "content": "Bosaso (Somali: Boosaaso, Arabic: بوصاصو), historically known as Bender Qassim is a city in the northeastern Bari province (gobol) of Somalia. It is the seat of the Bosaso District. Located on the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden, the municipality serves as the region's commercial capital and is a major seaport within the regional state of Puntland.\nThe city has a diverse economy centred on education, government, banking, tourism, aviation, food, clothes, logistics, steel, energy, health care, hospitality, retail and technology. The area's many colleges and universities make it a regional hub of higher education, including law, medicine, engineering, business and entrepreneurship.\n\nHistory\nThe Periplus of the Erythraean Sea indicates that Ancient Greek merchants sailed to Bosaso, providing notes about the strategic and geographical location of the current Bosaso area, which was known as Mosylon in ancient times. About 3+1⁄2 hours' walk from Bet Qasim, we came to Bander Kasin (also called by the Arabs: the native name is Bosaso), which was built about sixty years ago. The Kaptallah was considered as first settlers. \n\nFor centuries the city was among the areas ruled by Dishiishe clan.  later forming a part of Italian Somaliland. The town would eventually be administered through the official Bari region in the post-independence period.\nBosaso's population is estimated at 700,000 residents. It is the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargeisa. While Bosaso is a melting pot, with residents hailing from all the major clans of Somalia, most of its population is from the Harti confederation of Darod sub-clans.\nBosaso was previously known as Bandar Qasim, a name derived from a local trader of the same name who is said to have first settled in the area during the 14th century. It is believed that Qasim's favourite camel was called Boosaas, from which derived the current name of the town. The town was thus first called Bandar Qassim after its founder (\"Qasim's town\"), then later dubbed Bosaso after its founder's trusted camel. Historically, Bosaso has been a Harti stronghold, and evolved as a coastal town.\nNear Bosaso, at the end of the Baalade valley, lies a 2-to-3-kilometre-long (1.2-to-1.9-mile) earthwork. Local tradition recounts that the massive embankment marks the grave of a community matriarch. It is the largest such structure in the wider Horn region.\n\nGeography\nLocation and habitat\nBosaso is situated in northeastern Somalia, on the Gulf of Aden coast. Nearby settlements include to the east Rehiss (3.5 km or 2.5 miles), to the northeast Marero (14 km or 8.5 miles), to the west Baalade (3.5 km or 2 miles), to the southwest Laas Geel (16.5 km or 10 miles), to the south Lasgoriga (20.5 km or 13 miles), and to the southeast El Dhurre (36 km or 22.5 miles). The largest cities in the country most proximate to Bosaso are Erigavo (212 km or 132 miles), Burao (442 km or 275 miles), and Berbera (465 km or 289 miles). Shimbiris, the highest peak in Somalia, is located some 220 km (140 miles) to the southwest in the Cal Madow mountain range.\nIn June 2014, the Puntland government launched a new tree-planting campaign in the state, with the regional Ministry of Environment, Wildlife and Tourism slated to plant 25,000 trees by the end of the year. Bosaso is among the seven cities and towns earmarked for the reforestation initiative, which also include Garowe, Qardho, Dhahar, Buuhoodle, Baran and Galkayo. The campaign is part of a broader partnership between the Puntland authorities and EU to set up various environmental protection measures in the region, with the aim of promoting reforestation and afforestation.\n\nClimate\nBosaso has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh). It has a mean annual relative humidity of around 60%. The average daily mean temperature year-round is 30 °C (86 °F), with an average annual high of 35 °C (95 °F) and an average annual low of 25 °C (77 °F). Average low temperatures are coolest during the winter months of December to February, when thermometer readings typically level out at 20 °C (68 °F). The weather slowly heats up in the spring, as the April rainy season begins. Average high temperatures later peak during the summer months of June to August, when they consistently exceed 40 °C (104 °F). Come September, cooler weather starts to set in again. Rainfall reaches a high over this period, with an average precipitation of 7 mm (0.28 inches) in November. Total rainfall year-round is around 19 mm (0.75 inches).\n\nDemographics\nReliable census and survey data on Bosaso are limited, but estimates from United Nations agencies and humanitarian assessments can be used to trace population changes in both the Bosaso District (administrative area) and the city of Bosaso (urban core).\nThe Bosaso District has experienced significant growth. According to a 2005 breakdown by UNDP/UN OCHA, Bosaso’s total population was 164,906—divided into 107,181 urban and 57,725 non-urban residents. The UNDP estimate thus indicates the urban share was roughly 65% of district population at that time. Later, the Population Estimation Survey of Somalia conducted by UNFPA and the Somali National Bureau of Statistics estimated Bosaso District’s population in 2013–2014 at 469,566. Subsequent projections and compiled estimates placed the district’s population at about 615,000 by 2019. During the 2021–2022 drought crisis, the International Organization for Migration projected an influx of 52,471 internally displaced or drought-affected people entering Bosaso District.\nThe city of Bosaso has also seen considerable growth. In 2005, of the total 164,906 district residents, 107,181 were recorded as urban (i.e. residing in Bosaso town), giving an early estimate for the city core population. A 2009 UN-Habitat urban planning document estimated the city’s population at about 250,000, including approximately 45,000 internally displaced persons; these figures are referred to in the UNDP Bosaso City Strategy (2024). By 2015, secondary statistical compilations listed the urban population at approximately 235,000. Humanitarian assessments during the 2020s recorded a large displaced population. In April 2024, a UNHCR/CCCM site verification confirmed 116,740 internally displaced persons living in 22 sites across Bosaso. Some academic literature describes Bosaso as “one of the most populous towns in Puntland State, with a population of over 700,000 people.”\nIn short that the district’s urban core had about 107,181 residents in 2005, that district population growth later took it to the 400–600 thousand range by the 2010s, and that estimates for the city’s population (excluding or including IDPs) range between ~235,000 and ~250,000 in the 2010s, though some unverified claims assert 700,000 or more.\nFurthermore, Bosaso is a major port for boats carrying emigrants from within the country as well as adjacent territories across the Gulf of Aden to settle (sometimes illegally) in the Persian Gulf states.\nWhile Bosaso today is a melting pot, with residents hailing from many different parts of Somalia, most of the city's population is from Dishiishe, Majeerteen, Warsangeli and other Harti  groups of Darod. The city is also home to newly arrived IDPs.\n\nMunicipality\nBosaso city affairs are managed by the Bosaso Municipality, its leadership is appointed by members of the area's 29 District Councilors. The municipal authority is currently led by Mayor Abdisalam Bashiir Abdisalam who succeeded Yasin Mire Mohamud who himself succeeded Hassan Abdallah Hassan in office.\nEach of the city's various districts also has its own municipal sub-authorities, complete with a mayor and civil servants.\n\nEconomy\nBosaso is a city that is experiencing rapid growth. Prior to the Somali civil war, it had a population of under 50,000 inhabitants. Since the conflict, Somalis belonging to the Harti Darod sub-clans began migrating back to their ancestral areas of Puntland. As a consequence of these migrations, Bosaso's population and the local housing industry have grown tremendously.\n\nIn December 2011, a new commercial market opened in Bosaso's northern Dayaha (\"Star\") neighborhood, near the port. Approximately one-half kilometre (550 yd) in size, it was designed to ensure easy vehicle access. The market is the result of careful planning between Puntland government officials and civil society representatives. In September 2013, Puntland Minister of Fisheries Mohamed Farah Adan also announced that the Ministry in conjunction with the FAO would open a new fish market in the city, complete with modern refrigerators.\nBosaso is home to Golis Telecom Somalia, the largest telecommunications operator in northeastern Somalia. Founded in 2002 with the objective of supplying the country with GSM mobile services, fixed line and internet services, it has an extensive network that covers all of the nation's major cities and more than 40 districts in both Puntland and Somaliland. According to The Economist, Golis offers one of the cheapest international calling rates on the planet, at US$0.2 less than anywhere else in the world. In addition, Netco has its headquarters in the city. Other telecommunication firms serving the region include Telcom and NationLink.\nIn September 2013, Puntland Deputy Minister of Environment Burhan Elmi Hirsi also announced a plan by the Puntland government to establish a gas manufacturing plant in Bosaso. The new project is part of a broader campaign by the Puntland environmental authorities to avert deforestation and promote alternative sources of fuel.\n\nThe Hafun Fishing Company was established in 1992 in Bosaso. It was named after the northeastern port town of Hafun, where HFC also has an office. The firm exports a wide range of fish products, which it mainly sends to partners in the Middle East. The company is exploring additional global markets for its fish goods. It also maintains commercial interests in Puntland's housing market, which are represented by the firm's growing local real estate sales and development division.\nAdditionally, the Bosaso Tannery is based in the city. A ten-year-old manufacturing, distributing, wholesale and import/export company, it processes wet salted, dry salted, wet blue, limed, pickled, and air/frame dried sheep and goat hides and skin. Principle wet blue exports are to Turkey, Pakistan, India and China. Raw camel hides and sheep and goat skin are also exported to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nTransportation\nBosaso is traversed by a 750-kilometre (470 mi) north–south highway. It connects major cities in the northern part of the country, such as Galkayo and Garowe, with towns in the south. In June 2012, the Puntland Highway Authority (PHA) launched an upgrade and repair project on the large thoroughfare between Bosaso and Garowe. The transportation body also began rehabilitation work in October 2012 on the central artery linking the city with Qardho. Additionally, plans are in the works to construct new roads connecting littoral towns in the region to the main highway. In June 2014, Puntland President Abdiweli Mohamed Ali along with Bosaso Mayor Hassan Abdallah Hassan and other state officials also inaugurated a new 5.9-kilometre (3.7 mi) paved road in the city. The construction project leads to the Bosaso seaport, and was completed in conjunction with UNHABITAT. According to Ali, his administration plans to invest at least 23 million Euros in contributions from international partners in similar road infrastructure development initiatives.\nThe city has a major seaport, the Port of Bosaso. It was constructed during the mid-1980s by the Siad Barre administration for annual livestock shipments to the Middle East. In January 2012, a renovation project was launched, with KMC contracted to upgrade the Bosaso Port's harbor. The initiative's first phase saw the clean-up of unwanted materials from the dockyard and was completed within the month. The second phase involves the reconstruction of the port's adjoining seabed, with the objective of accommodating larger ships.\nBesides its busy seaport, Bosaso has a major airport, the Bender Qassim International Airport. In 2008, the Puntland government signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Dubai's Lootah Group, a regional industrial group operating in the Middle East and Africa. According to the agreement, the first phase of the investment is worth Dhs170m ($46.28m) and will see a set of new companies established to operate, manage and build Bosaso's free trade zone and sea and airport facilities. The Bosaso Airport Company is slated to develop the airport complex to meet international standards, including a new 3.4-kilometre (2.1 mi) runway, main and auxiliary buildings, taxi and apron areas, and security perimeters. In December 2014, the foundation stone for a new runway was also laid at the airport. The China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation is now slated to upgrade the airport's existing gravel runway, pave it with asphalt, and convert it from 1.8 to 2.65 km (1.12 to 1.65 miles) in accordance with the code 4C operations clause.\n\nEducation\nBosaso has a number of academic institutions. According to the Puntland Ministry of Education, there are 74 primary schools in the Bosaso District. Among these are the Iftin School, Alfurqan, Umul-Qura and Garisa. Secondary schools in the area include Hamdan, Shafi'i, Ughaz Yasin, Najah, Bosaso and Haji Yasin.\nTertiary education is provided by Bosaso College (BC), as well as the Puntland Nursing Institute (PNI). East Africa University (EAU) also has a Bosaso branch, one of its seven campuses in Puntland. Additionally, the Sam Greathouse School of Modern Technology (SG-SMT) has been working with the local government to construct a large scale dial-up network linking Bosaso to other northern Somali cities, including Berbera and Las Anod.\n\nPanorama\nTourist attractions\nBiyo Kulule is a hot spring located southeast of the city, 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) outside the city.\nMareero located (25 kilometres (16 mi) eastern direction of Bosaso, it is known for its white sand beach.\nGa'a, Laag, Karin, Yalho are considered as places to visit.\n\nMedia\nBosaso is home to a number of private media outlets.
