The structure displays a compact rectangular plan, with a domed mihrab axis. The mihrab is made of marble from northern India and bears a dated inscription.\nHistoric photographs of the mosque feature in drawings and images of central Mogadishu from the late 19th century onwards. The mosque can be identified amidst other buildings by its two conical domes, one round and the other hexagonal.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nIslam in Somalia\nList of mosques in Somalia\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nPradines, Stéphane (2022).
