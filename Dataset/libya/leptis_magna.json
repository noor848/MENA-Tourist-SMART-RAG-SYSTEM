      "content": "Leptis or Lepcis Magna, (Arabic: لبدة الكبرى, romanized: Libda al-Kubrā) also known by other names in antiquity, was a prominent city of the Carthaginian Empire and Roman Libya at the mouth of the Wadi Lebda in the Mediterranean.\nEstablished as a Punic settlement prior to 500 BC, the city experienced significant expansion under Roman Emperor Septimius Severus (r. 193–211), who was born in the city. The 3rd Augustan Legion was stationed here to defend the city against Berber incursions. After the legion's dissolution under Gordian III in 238, the city was increasingly open to raids in the later part of the 3rd century. Diocletian reinstated the city as provincial capital, and it grew again in prosperity until it fell to the Vandals in 439. It was reincorporated into the Eastern Empire in 533 but continued to be plagued by Berber raids and never recovered its former importance. It fell to the Muslim invasion in c. 647 and was subsequently abandoned.\nAfter being abandoned, the city was remarkably preserved as it lay buried beneath layers of sand dunes. In the 1920s, the city was unearthed by Italian archaeologists during Italy's occupation of Libya. Its ruins are within present-day Al-Khums, Libya, 130 km (81 mi) east of Tripoli. They are among the best-preserved Roman sites in the Mediterranean.\n\nNames\nThe Punic name of the settlement was written LPQ (Punic: 𐤋𐤐𐤒) or LPQY (𐤋𐤐𐤒𐤉). This has been tentatively connected to the Semitic root (present in Arabic) LFQ, meaning \"to build\" or \"to piece together\", presumably in reference to the construction of the city.\nThis name was hellenized as Léptis (Ancient Greek: Λέπτις), also known as Léptis Megálē (Λέπτις μεγάλη, \"Greater Leptis\") distinguishing it from the \"Lesser Leptis\" closer to Carthage in modern-day Tunisia. It was also known by the Greeks as Neápolis (Νεάπολις, \"New Town\"). The latinization of these names was Lepcis or Leptis Magna (\"Greater Leptis\"), which also appeared as the \"Leptimagnese City\" (Latin: Leptimagnensis Civitas). The Latin demonym was \"Leptitan\" (Leptitanus). It was also known as Ulpia Traiana as a Roman colony, after Emperor Trajan of the Ulpia gens. Its Italian name is Lepti Maggiore, and in Arabic it is named Labdah (لَبْدَة).\n\nHistory\nPunics\nThe Punic city was founded in the second half of the 7th century BC. Little is known about Leptis during this time, but it appears to have been powerful enough to repel Dorieus's attempt to establish a Greek colony nearby around 515 BC. Like most Punic settlements, Leptis became part of the Carthaginian Empire and fell under Rome's control with Carthage's defeat in the Punic Wars. Leptis remained highly independent for a period after about 111 BC.\n\nRoman Republic\nThe Roman Republic sent some colonists together with a small garrison in order to control the city. The city prospered and was even allowed to coin its own money in silver and bronze. Reflecting its blend of cultures, its coins bore Punic inscriptions but images of Hercules and Dionysus. Soon Italian merchants settled in the city and started a profitable commerce with the Libyan interior. The city depended primarily on the fertility of its surrounding farmland, where many olive-presses have been excavated. By 46 BC, its olive oil production was of such an extent that the city was able to provide three million pounds of oil annually to Julius Caesar as tax.\n\nRoman Empire\nKenneth D. Matthews Jr. writes:\n\nDuring the reign of Augustus, Leptis Magna was classified as a civitas libera et immunis, or a free community, over which the governor had an absolute minimum of control. As such Leptis retain its two suphetes at the head of its government, with the mhzm, similar to the Roman aediles, as minor magistrates. In addition there were such sacred officials as the ʾaddir ʾararim or praefectus sacrorum, the nēquim ēlīm, and probably a sacred college of fifteen members.\n\nLeptis Magna remained as such until the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius, when the city and the surrounding area were formally incorporated into the empire as part of the province of Africa. It soon became one of the leading cities of Roman Africa and a major trading post. The city grew rapidly under Roman administration. During the reign of Nero, an amphitheater was constructed. The settlement was elevated to municipium in AD 64 or 65 and to colonia under Trajan (r. 98–117). The first known bishop of Leptis Magna was a certain priest called Victor who became pope in 189.\nLeptis achieved its greatest prominence beginning in AD 193, as the hometown of emperor Septimius Severus. Septimius favored his hometown above all other provincial cities, and the buildings and wealth he lavished on it made Leptis Magna the third-most important city in Africa, rivaling Carthage and Alexandria. In AD 205, he and the imperial family visited the city and bestowed great honors. Among the changes that Severus introduced were the creation of a magnificent new forum and the rebuilding of the docks. The natural harbor had a tendency to silt up, but the Severan changes made this worse, and the eastern wharves are extremely well preserved, since they were scarcely used.\nLeptis prospered through trans-Saharan trade in various valuable goods, including ivory, wild animals for the gladiatorial arena, gold dust, carbuncle, precious woods like ebony, and ostrich feathers.\nLeptis overextended itself during this period.  During the Crisis of the 3rd Century, when trade declined precipitously, Leptis Magna's importance also fell into a decline, and by the middle of the 4th century, even before it was completely devastated by the 365 tsunami, large parts of the city had been abandoned.  Ammianus Marcellinus recounts that the crisis was worsened by a corrupt Roman governor named Romanus, who demanded bribes to protect the city during a major tribal raid.  The ruined city could not pay these and complained to the emperor Valentinian I.  Romanus then bribed people at court and arranged for the Leptan envoys to be punished \"for bringing false accusations\".  It enjoyed a minor renaissance beginning in the reign of the emperor Theodosius I.\n\nVandal Kingdom\nIn 439, Leptis Magna and the rest of the cities of Tripolitania fell under the control of the Vandals when their king, Gaiseric, captured Carthage from the Romans and made it his capital. Unfortunately for the future of Leptis Magna, Gaiseric ordered the city's walls demolished so as to dissuade its people from rebelling against Vandal rule. The people of Leptis and the Vandals both paid a heavy price for this in AD 523 when a group of Berber raiders sacked the city.\n\nByzantine Empire\nBelisarius, general of Emperor Justinian I, recaptured Leptis Magna in the name of the Roman Empire ten years later, and in 533–4 it was re-incorporated into the empire. Leptis became a provincial capital of the Eastern Empire, but never recovered from the destruction wreaked upon it by the Berbers. In 544, under the prefecture of Sergius, the city came under intensified attack of Berber tribes, and after some successes, Sergius was reduced to retreating into the city, with the  Leuathae tribal confederation camped outside the gate demanding payments. Sergius admitted eighty deputies into the city to present their demands, but when Sergius moved to leave the conference he was detained by the robe by one deputy and crowded by others. This provoked an officer of the prefect's guard to kill the deputy laying hands on the prefect, which resulted in a general massacre. The Berbers reacted with an all-out attack and Sergius was eventually forced to abandon Leptis and retreat to Carthage.\n\nIslamic conquest\nBy the 6th century, the city was fully Christianized. During the decade 565–578 AD, Christian missionaries from Leptis Magna even began to move once more among the Berber tribes as far south as the Fezzan in the Libyan desert and converted the Garamantes. Numerous new churches were built in the 6th century, but the city continued to decline, and by the time of the Arab conquest around 647 the city was mostly abandoned except for a Byzantine garrison force and a population of less than 1,000 inhabitants. By the 10th century, the city of Al-Khums had fully absorbed it.\n\nExcavation\nToday, the site of Leptis Magna is the site of some of the most impressive ruins of the Roman period.\n\nPart of an ancient temple was brought from Leptis Magna to the British Museum in 1816 and installed at the Fort Belvedere royal residence in England in 1826. It now lies in part of Windsor Great Park. The ruins are located between the south shore of Virginia Water and Blacknest Road close to the junction with the A30 London Road and Wentworth Drive.\n\nWhen Italians conquered Italian Libya in the early 20th century, they dedicated huge efforts to the rediscovery of Leptis Magna. In the early 1930s, Italian archeological research was able to show again the buried remains of nearly all the city. A 4th to 3rd century BC necropolis was found under the Roman theatre.\nIn June 2005, it was revealed that archaeologists from the University of Hamburg had been working along the coast of Libya when they uncovered a 30 ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century. The mosaics show with exceptional clarity depictions of a warrior in combat with a deer, four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground, and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue and staring at his slain opponent.  The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a balneae within a Roman villa at Wadi Lebda in Leptis Magna. The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of representational mosaic art ever seen—a \"masterpiece comparable in quality with the Alexander Mosaic in Pompeii.\"  The mosaics were originally discovered in the year 2000 but were kept secret in order to avoid looting. They are currently on display in the Leptis Magna Museum.\nThere were reports that Leptis Magna was used as a cover for tanks and military vehicles by pro-Gaddafi forces during the First Libyan Civil War in 2011. When asked if the historic site could be targeted in an airstrike, NATO refused to rule out the possibility of such an action, saying that it had not been able to confirm the rebels' report that weapons were being hidden at the location. Shortly after the war, Libyan archaeologist Hafed Walda reported that Leptis Magna, along with nearby Rasaimergib Fort and the western Tripolis of Sabratha, had \"so far seen no visible loss\" from either fighting on the ground or bombings conducted by international forces.\nIn the midst of the Second Libyan Civil War and the disappearance of governmental and international support for the site, people living in the area organized to voluntarily protect and maintain Leptis Magna.\n\nClimate change\nSince they are located on the coast, Leptis Magna ruins are vulnerable to sea level rise. In 2022, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report included them in the list of African cultural sites which would be threatened by flooding and coastal erosion by the end of the century, but only if climate change followed RCP 8.5, which is the scenario of high and continually increasing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the warming of over 4 °C., and is no longer considered very likely. The other, more plausible scenarios result in lower warming levels and consequently lower sea level rise: yet, sea levels would continue to increase for about 10,000 years under all of them. Even if the warming is limited to 1.5 °C, global sea level rise is still expected to exceed 2–3 m (7–10 ft) after 2000 years (and higher warming levels will see larger increases by then), consequently exceeding 2100 levels of sea level rise under RCP 8.5 (~0.75 m (2 ft) with a range of 0.5–1 m (2–3 ft)) well before the year 4000. Thus, it is a matter of time before the Leptis Magna ruins are threatened by rising water levels, unless they can be protected by adaptation efforts such as sea walls.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nLibya in the Roman era\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nFurther reading\nBabelon, E.C.F.

      "content": "لبده الكبرى مدينه من مدن الشمال الافريقي الكبرى السابقه، وتقع على الساحل المتوسطي عند مصب وادي لبده الذي يكون مرفا طبيعيا على بعد 3 كيلومترات شرقي مدينه الخمس، التي تبعد 120 كم شرق مدينه طرابلس عاصمه ليبيا، المدينه كانت من ابرز مدن الشمال الافريقي في عصر الامبراطوريه الرومانيه.\nالمدينه صنفتها اليونسكو ضمن قائمه مواقع التراث العالمي في ليبيا وذلك منذ العام 1982.\n\nتاسيس المدينه\nكانت منطقه لبده موطنا لجماعات بشريه في عصور ما قبل التاريخ كما تدل على ذلك بعض حجاره وجدت على ضفاف وادي الرمله، وقد ظهرت مدينه لبده كمرفا طبيعي يلجا اليه البحاره والتجار الكنعانيون (الفينيقيون) اثناء رحلاتهم التجاريه النشطه في المتوسط.\nالفينيقيون اسسوا مدينه لبتيس ماغنا (لبده) «واسمها الصحيح لفقي» في نهايه القرن السابع قبل الميلاد، سميت باللاتيني «لبكيس». وهذا التاريخ يقرب من تاريخ انشاء قرطاجنه (قرطاج). وكان المؤسسون اهالي مدينه صور الفينيقيه من عبده الاله ملك عشتارت واله الكون ارص ـ ومن هذه الكلمه الاخيره خرجت كلمه «ارض» ـ، وهي نفس عبادات صور، ولم يكن هذان الالهان يُعبدان من قبل في ليبيا. حتى في المدن الليبيه الاخرى مثل اويا وصبراته، لم يكن الاهالي يعبدون هذين الالهين وهذا يدل على ان صوريي لبده حملوا من مدينه صور الهتهم التي لم تكن تعبد حتى في لبده الكبرى.\nوسرعان ما نما ذلك المرفا التجاري ليصبح احد احواض البحر المتوسط المهمه حيث احتوى لاحقا على مناره لبده التي انشاها الامبراطور الروماني سبتيموس سيفيروس حوالي العام 200 قبل الميلاد.\nوالان لبده تعد من اجمل المناطق الاثريه في منطقه البحر المتوسط، كما انها من اكبر بقايا المدن الرومانيه في العالم.\n\nاصل التسميه\nكانت المدينه معروفه عند القرطاجيين باسم «لبكي»، وقد حرفها اليونانيون الى «لبشس». وبقيت هذه الكلمه مستعمله الى القرن الثالث ق م، ثم حرفت في اللغه اليونانيه من «لبشس» الى «لبتس» لسهوله النطق في اللغه اليونانيه بكلمه «لبتس» عن «لبشس». وبما ان «لبتس» اسم لمدينه في «بيزاشينا» خافوا ان يحصل التباس بين المدينتين، فاضافوا الى لبتس الافريقيه كلمه «مانيا»، فصارت «لبتس مانيا» ومعناها لبده العظمى ، او لبده الكبرى.وان ال ابو لبده من عهد اليونان وهم ينتمون الي الامبراطور الروماني ومنهم من يعيش في اسرائيل وفي رومانيا وفي اليونان باسم لفادا اي بولبده ويوجد كثير من هذه العائله لا تعرف بعضها ولا يوجد اي صله قرابه.\n\nتاريخ المدينه\nاستطاع الفينيقيون ان يعمروا البلاد بسرعه نظرا لخصوبه ارضها، واعتدال مناخها وصلاحيته للسكنى، ولان لها ميناء مامونا وصالحا للملاحه ولوقوعها على نهر عين كعام، الذي يقع شرقيها بقليل. ومما زاد في سرعه عمرانها العلاقات الطيبه التي نشات بين السكان والفينيقيين نتيجه لحسن معاملتهم لهم. وذكر هيرودوت واقعه كبيره عند مصب «كنبس» وادي كعام. وقد اعتراها الانحطاط في اواخر القرن السادس ق م. وفي هذا الوقت حاولت مجموعه من الاغريق بقياده الامير الاسبرطي دوريوس.، كون الاغريق انذاك تركزو اساسا في برقه، ان تنشيء مستعمره عند مصب نهر «كنبس» نهر عين كعام، منتهزه ما اعترى لبده من التاخر وانحطاط، وقد تم لها ما ارادت.\nخاف القرطاجنيين تسرب النفوذ الاغريقي غربي سرت فلم يلبثوا ان هاجموها وخربوا مستعمرتها وطردوا الاغريق واستولوا على لبده وما حولها، واعادوا اليها ما فقدت من عمرانها وحضاراتها، وتوطد ملك القرطاجنيين فيما بين السرت الكبير والسرت الصغير، واطلق على هذه المنطقه اسم «امبوريا»، وصارت جزءا من املاك قرطاجه، وبقيت لبده المركز الرئيسي للمنطقه فيما بين السرتين، وتتمتع باستقلال داخلي، وبقيت تحت حكم القرطاجنيين الى اوائل القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد.\n\nفي اوائل القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد اصبحت تابعه للنوميديين في الفتره ما بين الحربين القرطاجنتين الثانيه سنه 218، والثالثه سنه 149 ق م. وكانت تبعيتها للنوميديين شكليه؛ لانها كانت مقصوره على دفع الجزيه. وفي سنه 111 ق م، ارسلت وفدا الى روما طالبه صداقتها والتحالف معها للتخلص من حكم النوميديين، وفي سنه 107 ق م امدتها روما باربع كتائب من الجنود لمحاربه النوميديين. ويظهر انها لم يمكنها التغلب عليهم، وبقيت تحت سيادتهم الاسميه متمتعه باستقلالها الداخلي الى ان احتلها الروم سنه 42 ق م، وانتهى حكم النوميديين.\nوبدخول لبده تحت الروم صارت جزءا من افريقيه الرومانيه، هذا بالنسبه للسواحل، اما الدواخل فبقيت تحت سلطه حاكم من نوميديا حتى اوائل القرن الثالث م، حيث اقيم خط دفاع ضد سكان الجنوب وسموه «ليمس تريبوليتانوس». وقد تعرضت لبده لغارات الجرمنتيين فيما بين سنتي 24 و 17 ق م، واستعانوا بقبائل اخرى من الجنوب، وذلك بسبب نزاع قام بينها وبين اويا «طرابلس الان» بسبب اختطاف الماشيه، والتعدي على بعض الاشخاص، فاستنجدت «اويا» بالجرمنتيين وبعض قبائل الجنوب، فخفوا لنجدتها، وهاجموا لبده فتغلبوا عليها وخربوا ضواحيها، واضطر السكان الى الاحتماء باسوار المدينه حتى ادركهم «فاليريوفيستو» بجيشه وطرد الجرمنتيين، واعاد الى المدينه طمانينتها وما فقدته من اهميه كانت تتمتع بها كمحطه للقوافل، التي كانت تصل ساحل البحر المتوسط بالجنوب والسودان.\nوفي سنه 146م، ظهر في لبده «ستيميو سيفير» وهو من احدى الاسر الكريمه فيها، فتولى عرشها وعنى بشؤونها، ونشر فيها العلم والامن، وامعن في مطارده المعتدين عليها من قبائل الجنوب حتى اقصاهم عنها، وعني برقيها الداخلي، فوفر لها سبل الحياه الصالحه بما انشا فيها من وسائل العمران والتقدم. وتقديرا لاعمال هذا الرجل المصلح واعترافا باخلاصه اطلق السكان على انفسهم اسم «الستيميين» تيمنا باسم ستيميو، واشتهروا بذلك.\n\nالامبراطور سيبتيموس سيفيروس\nفي القرن الثالث الميلادي، زمن الامبراطور سيبتيموس سيفيروس Septimius Severus ، من سنه 193 الى 211م، وزمن الكسندر سيفيروس من سنه 222 الى سنه 235م، بلغت لبده مبلغا عظيما في الحضاره والتقدم العمراني، وفي هذا العصر كان سكانها خليطا من الليبيين والقرطاجنيين والروم والاغريق، وبلغ عددهم ثمانين الفا. وكانت اويا «طرابلس» في هذا العهد لم تبلغ شؤوا يمكنها من مزاحمه لبده في النفوذ والسلطان. وفي القرن الرابع اصدر دقيانوس امره باعطاء اويا لقب ولايه، وكانت لبده لها الصداره، فاخذت اويا تزاحمها في صدراتها ومكانتها. وفيما بين سنتي 363، 366 من القرن الرابع م، اعتدى الاستريانون على ولايه لبده فالحقوا بها اضرارا بالغه، وخصوصا بالمدينه حتى ساءت احوالها واخذت في الانحطاط حتى طمع فيها الوندال. وفي سنه 455 م، احتلها الوندال وقاموا بخرابها، لم يعنوا بها وتركوها للفوضى، وامتدت اليها يد النهب والسلب من القبائل البربريه المقيمه في المدينه وحولها، واكبرها قبيله لواته. وفي هذه الفتره اصيبت بفيضان كبير من وادي عين كعام فحطم الجسور والاسوار، وكان له اسوا الاثر في شل الايدي العامله، وتسرب الياس الى النفوس من القدره على الاصلاح. فاهمل شانها، وزحفت الرمال عليها، ودبت روح التمرد في القبائل القاطنه حولها. ولم تات سنه 533م حتى حولت هذه القبائل الفوضويه المدينه الى خراب، وطمع البيزنطيون في احتلالها.\nوفي سنه 533 م. احتل البيزنطيون لبده، وكان احتلالهم لها بدايه عهد جديد لعمرانها واسترداد بعض ما فقدت من حضارتها واتخذت مقرا للحاكم العسكري، وقد اصلح جوستنيان كثيرا مما امتدت اليه ايدي الفساد في العهد الذي قبله. وادخل عليها الروم من فنون العماره والزخرفه ما زاد في ضخامتها وجمالها.\n\nوبعد جوستنيان اخذت البلاد في الانحطاط، والسير الى الخراب بخطى واسعه. وفي سنه 643م، وصلت اليها طلائع العرب الاولى للفتح الاسلامي، فلم تجد في لبده من العمران الا بقايا من قصورها العظيمه ودورها الفخمه، والا بقايا من السكان خليطا من اجناس متعدده يعيشون فيما بقي من خرائب دورها وقصورها.\n\nعظمه المدينه\nيتميز موقع المدينه بقربها من مناطق زراعيه مهمه مثل مرتفعات الحسان الثلاث (ترهونه ونهر السنبس ووادي كعام). وللتدليل على مدى ثرائها وغناها، ان الامبراطور الروماني يوليوس قيصر انزل بها عقوبه لمساندتها لخصمه بومبيي الذي هزمه سنه 48 ق. م، بلغت ثلاثه ملايين رطل من زيت الزيتون سنوياً. وعلى الرغم من تلك الجزيه المجحفه فقد ازدهرت مدينه لبده لتبلغ شاناً كبيراً في القرن الثاني الميلادي خاصه عندما اعتلى عرش الامبراطوريه الرومانيه احد ابنائها سيبتيموس سيفيروس (193 م- 211 م) الذي امتد حكم عائلته للامبراطوريه الى سنه 235 م. واثناء هذه الفتره شهدت مدينه لبده اكبر توسعاتها، حيث شيدت الساحه السويريه والايوان السويري (البزيلكه) والشارع المعمد ونبع الحوريات وقوس النصر لسبتيموس سويروس ومناره لبده.\nان الميدان القديم واطلال المعابد المحيطه به والمجاور للميناء، هو مركز المدينه قبل اتساعها في ولايه العهد الروماني، وفي هذه الاماكن نتتبع نمو المدينه واتساعها بالوقوف على التواريخ المتتاليه التي اقيمت فيها المباني العامه الفخمه كمبنى السوق البونيقيه (انشئ في عام 8 ق. م) والمسرح نصف الدائري (في السنه الاولى قبل الميلاد) ومبنى الكالكيديكوم في سنه (11م- 12م) ثم توالى انشاء المباني الاخرى خلال القرن الاول والثاني الميلاديين، التي من بينها حمامات الامبراطور هادريان (اقيمت بين عامي 126م- 127م) وجددت في عهد الامبراطور سبتيموس سويروس.\n\nاكتشافات جديده\nقام فريق من الاثريين التابعين لجامعه هامبورغ الالمانيه باستكشاف منطقه لبده واعلنوا في شهر يونيو 2006 عن اكتشاف ارضيه من الموزاييك طولها 30 قدم تعود الى الفتره بين القرن الاول والثاني ميلادي. هذه القطع تبين محارب في معركه مع غزال و4 رجال يصارعون ثور بري على الارض، ومصارع يسترخي على الارض في حاله اعياء. هذه القطعه الجميله تزيين حمام في فيلا رومانيه. وهي معروضه حاليا بمتحف لبده.\n\nالمراجع\nالمصادر\nتاريخ الفتح العربي في ليبيه (للمؤرخ الطاهر الزاوي)\nصور للمدينه\nRichard Talbert, Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World,
