      "content": "Ghat (Hindi: [ɡʱaːʈ]), a term used in the Indian subcontinent, to refer  to the series of steps leading down to a body of water or wharf, such as a bathing or cremation place along the banks of a river or pond, the Ghats in Varanasi, Dhobi Ghat or the Aapravasi Ghat.\n\nEtymology\nThe origin of the English 'ghat' is Sanskrit: घट्ट, ghaṭṭa and is normally translated as ghaṭ, quay, landing or bathing place, as well as steps by a river-side.  The word 'ghat' has also been derived from Dravidian etymons such as  Telugu kaṭṭa  and gaṭṭu (dam and embankment) derived from kaṭṭu  meaning \"to tie\".\n\nTypes\nRiver ghats\nThese are bathing wharves on a river.\nThe numerous significant ghats along the Ganges are the Varanasi ghats (the city of Varanasi has 88 ghats) and generically the \"ghats of the Ganges\". Most of these were constructed under the patronage of various Maratha rulers such as Ahilyabai Holkar (Queen of the Malwa Kingdom from 1767 to 1795) in the 18th century.\nIn Madhya Pradesh in central India, there are further significant ghats along the Narmada River. People who live on the steps are also called ghats.\nThe Bhagalpur Ghats are another examples.\n\nShmashana, the cremation ghats\nGhats such as these are useful for both mundane purposes (such as cleaning) and religious rites (i.e. ritual bathing or ablutions); there are also specific \"shmashana\" or \"cremation\" ghats where bodies are cremated waterside, allowing ashes to be washed away by rivers. Notable examples include Nigambodh Ghat and Raj Ghat in Delhi, situated on the Yamuna River. Raj Ghat, in particular, was the cremation site for Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and numerous political leaders after him, and the Manikarnika Ghat at Varanasi on the Ganges.\n\nAs place name suffix\n\"Ghat\" and \"Ghata\" is also a suffix used in several place names across the subcontinent. This is an incomplete list:\n\nBalaghat, Madhya Pradesh, India\nBalurghat, West Bengal, India\nBatiaghata, Khulna, Bangladesh\nCharghat, Rajshahi, Bangladesh\nChunarughat, Habiganj, Bangladesh\nDevghat, Nepal\nGaighat, Nepal\nGhatail, Tangail, Bangladesh\nGhoraghat, Dinajpur, Bangladesh\nGoalandaghat, Rajbari, Bangladesh\nGolaghat, Assam, India\nGowainghat, Sylhet, Bangladesh\nHaluaghat, Mymensingh, Bangladesh\nKanaighat, Sylhet, Bangladesh\nPasighat, Arunachal Pradesh, India\nPatharghata, Barguna, Bangladesh\nSaghata, Gaibandha, Bangladesh\n\nOutside Indian subcontinent\nThe word is also used in some places outside the Indian subcontinent. For example, in George Town, Penang, Malaysia, the label \"Ghaut\" is used to identify the extensions of those streets which formerly ended in ghats before the reclamation of the quayside (e.g., Church St Ghaut, in Malay Gat Lebuh Gereja, is the name of the extension of Church St beyond where the street used to descend to the water via a ghat). Both in Penang and Singapore, there are areas named Dhoby Ghaut (dhobi meaning \"launderer\" or \"laundry\", depending on whether it refers to a person or a business).\nAapravasi Ghat or The Immigration Depot is a building complex located in Port Louis on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, the first British colony to receive indentured, or contracted, labour workforce from India. From 1849 to 1923, half a million Indian indentured labourers passed through the Immigration Depot, to be transported to plantations throughout the British Empire. The large-scale migration of the laborers left an indelible mark on the societies of many former British colonies, with Indians constituting a substantial proportion of their national populations. In Mauritius alone, 68 percent of the current total population is of Indian ancestry. The Immigration Depot has thus become an important reference point in the history and cultural identity of Mauritius.\n\nSee also\nGhats in Varanasi\nGhats in Bhagalpur\nGhat Roads\nSurinaam Ghat\nTemple tank\nStepwell\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nGhats of Varanasi, webpage at Varanasi official website.",
