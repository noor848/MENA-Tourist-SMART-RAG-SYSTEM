          "content": "Baghdad is the capital and largest city in Iraq. It is located on the banks of the Tigris in central Iraq. The city has an estimated population of 8 million. It ranks among the most populous and largest cities in the Middle East and the Arab world and constitutes 22% of the country's population. Baghdad is a primary financial and commercial center in the region.\nFounded in 762 AD by Al-Mansur, Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate and became its most notable development project. The city evolved into an intellectual and cultural center. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the House of Wisdom, as well as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious environment, garnered it a worldwide reputation as the \"Center of Learning\". For much of the Abbasid era, during the Islamic Golden Age, Baghdad was one of the largest cities in the world and rivaled Chang'an, as the population peaked at more than one million. It was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues, shift in power and multiple successive empires. Later, Baghdad served as the administrative center of Ottoman Iraq, exercising authority over the provinces of Basra, Mosul, and Shahrizor.\nDuring the First World War, Baghdad was made the capital of Mandatory Iraq. With the recognition of Iraq as an independent monarchy in 1932, it gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of Arab culture. During the Ba'ath Party rule, the city experienced a period of relative prosperity and growth. However, it faced severe infrastructural damage due to the Iraq War, which began with the invasion of Iraq in 2003, resulting in a substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts. During the insurgency and renewed war from 2013 to 2017, it had one of the highest rates of terrorist attacks in the world. However, these attacks have gradually declined since the territorial defeat of the Islamic State militant group in Iraq in 2017, and are now rare. Since the end of the war, numerous reconstruction projects have been underway to induce stability.\nIraq's largest city, Baghdad is the seat of government. It generates 40% of the economy of Iraq. A major center of Islamic history, Baghdad is home to numerous historic mosques, as well as churches, mandis and synagogues, highlighting the city's historical diversity. Religious sites such as Masjid al-Kadhimayn, Buratha Mosque, the Shrine of Abdul-Qadir Gilani and Abu Hanifa Mosque are visited by millions of people annually. It was once home to a large Jewish community and was regularly visited by Sikh pilgrims from India. Baghdad is a regional cultural hub. The city is well known for its coffeehouses.\n\nName\nThe name Baghdad is pre-Islamic, and its origin is disputed. The site where the city of Baghdad developed has been populated for millennia. Archaeological evidence shows that the site of Baghdad was occupied by various peoples long before the Arab conquest of Mesopotamia in 637 CE, and several ancient empires had capitals located in the surrounding area.\nArab authors, realizing the pre-Islamic origins of Baghdad's name, generally looked for its roots in Middle Persian. They suggested various meanings, the most common of which was \"bestowed by God\". Modern scholars generally tend to favor this etymology, which views the word as a Persian compound of bagh () \"god\" and dād () \"given\". In Old Persian the first element can be traced to boghu and is related to Indo-Iranian bhag and Slavic bog \"god.\" A similar term in Middle Persian is the name Mithradāt (Mehrdad in New Persian), known in English by its borrowed Hellenistic form Mithridates, meaning \"Given by Mithra\" (dāt is the more archaic form of dād, related to Sanskrit dāt, Latin dat and English donor), ultimately borrowed from Persian Mehrdad. There are a number of other locations whose names are compounds of the Middle Persian word bagh, including Baghlan and Bagram in Afghanistan, Baghshan in Iran itself, and Baghdati in Georgia, which likely share the same etymological Iranic origins.\nOther authors have suggested older origins for the name, in particular the name Bagdadu or Hudadu that existed in Old Babylonian (spelled with a sign that can represent both bag and hu), and the Jewish Babylonian Aramaic name of a place called Baghdatha (בגדתא). Some scholars suggested Aramaic derivations.\nAnother highly recommended view is that Baghdad is a reference to Bagh and Dad as in Dadan, Dedan, and Dad as in Hadad, Adad. Another view suggested by Christophe Wall-Romana, is that name of \"Baghdad\" is derived from \"Akkad\", as the cuneiform logogram for Akkad (𒀀𒂵𒉈𒆠) is pronounced \"a-ga-dèKI\" (\"Agade\") and its resemblance to \"Baghdad\" is compelling. It is argued that, throughout all the various spellings of the city's name, whether Baghdad [بغداد], Baghdadh [بغداذ], Baghdan [بغدان], Maghdad [مغداد], Maghdadh [مغداذ], or Maghdan [مغدان], the only phonetically definite segment of the name appears to be Aghda [ىَغْدَا], which could be equated with the pronunciation of the name Agade.\nWhen the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur founded a completely new city for his capital, he chose the name \"City of peace\" (Arabic: مدینة السلام, romanized: Madīnat as-Salām), which now refers to the Round City of Baghdad proper. By the 11th century, Baghdad became almost the exclusive name for the world-renowned metropolis.\nChristophe Wall-Romana has suggested that al-Mansur's choice to found his \"new city\" at Baghdad because of its strategic location was the same criteria which influenced Sargon's choice to found the original city of Akkad in the exact same location.\n\nHistory\nFoundation\nAfter the fall of the Umayyads, the victorious Abbasids sought a new capital. On 30 July 762, the Caliph Al-Mansur commissioned Baghdad's construction, guided by the Iranian Barmakids. He believed Baghdad was ideal for ruling the Islamic Empire. Historian al-Tabari recorded a prophecy from Christian monks about a leader named Miklas building a great city in the area, and Al-Mansur, who was once called Miklas, saw this as a good omen. He expressed deep affection for the site, declaring it would be the home of his dynasty.\nThe two designers who were hired by Al-Mansur to plan the city's design were Naubakht, a Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city would be astrologically auspicious, and Mashallah, a Jew from Khorasan, Iran. They determined the city's auspicious founding date under the sign of Leo the lion, symbolizing strength and expansion.\nBaghdad's strategic location along the Tigris and its abundant water supply contributed to its rapid growth. It was divided into three judicial districts: Round City (Madinat al-Mansur), al-Karkh (al-Sharqiyya), and Askar al-Mahdi. To prevent disturbances, Al-Mansur moved markets to al-Karkh. Over time, Baghdad became a hub for merchants and craftsmen. Officials called \"Muhtasib\" monitored trade to prevent fraud.\nBaghdad surpassed Ctesiphon, the former Sassanid capital, located 30 km southeast. The ruins of Ctesiphon remain in Salman Pak, where Salman the Persian is believed to be buried. Ctesiphon itself had replaced Seleucia, which had earlier succeeded Babylon. According to the traveler Ibn Battuta, Baghdad was one of the largest cities, not including the damage it has received. The residents are mostly Hanbalis. Most residents were Hanbali Muslims. The city housed Abu Hanifa's grave, marked by a mosque and cell. Its ruler, Abu Said Bahadur Khan, was a Tatar who had embraced Islam.\nBaghdad was designed to symbolize Paradise as described in the Qur'an. It took four years (764–768) to build, with over 100,000 workers involved. Al-Mansur recruited engineers and artisans worldwide. Astrologers Naubakht Ahvazi and Mashallah advised starting construction under Leo, associated with fire, productivity, and expansion. Bricks for the city were 18 inches square, and Abu Hanifah supervised their production. A canal supplied water for drinking and construction. Marble was used extensively, including steps leading to the river.\nThe city's layout consisted of two large semicircles, with a 2 km-wide circular core known as the \"Round City.\" It had parks, gardens, villas, and promenades. Unlike European cities of the time, Baghdad had a sanitation system, fountains, and public baths, with thousands of hammams enhancing hygiene. The mosque and guard headquarters stood at the center, though some central space's function remains unknown. Baghdad's circular design reflected ancient Near Eastern urban planning, similar to the Sasanian city of Gur and older Mesopotamian cities like Mari. While Tell Chuera and Tell al-Rawda also provide examples of this type of urban planning existing in Bronze Age Syria. This style of urban planning contrasted with Ancient Greek and Roman urban planning, in which cities are designed as squares or rectangles with streets intersecting each other at right angles.\nBaghdad was lively, with attractions like cabarets, chess halls, live plays, concerts, and acrobatics. Storytelling flourished, with professional storytellers (al-Qaskhun) captivating crowds, inspiring the tales of Arabian Nights. The city had four walls named after major destinations—Kufa, Basra, Khurasan, and Syria; their gates pointed in on these destinations. The gates were 2.4 km apart, with massive iron doors requiring several men to operate. The walls, up to 44 meters thick and 30 meters high, were reinforced with a second wall, towers, and a moat for added defense. On street corners, storytellers engaged crowds with tales such as those later told in Arabian Nights. The Golden Gate Palace, home of the caliph, stood at Baghdad's center with a grand 48-meter green dome. Only the caliph could approach its esplanade on horseback. Nearby were officer residences and a guardhouse. After Caliph Al-Amin's death in 813, the palace ceased to be the caliph's residence.\n\nCenter of learning (8th–9th centuries)\nWithin a generation of its founding, Baghdad became a hub of learning and commerce. The city flourished into an unrivaled intellectual center of science, medicine, philosophy, and education, especially with the Abbasid translation movement began under the second caliph Al-Mansur and thrived under the seventh caliph Al-Ma'mun. Baytul-Hikmah or the \"House of Wisdom\" was among the most well known academies, and had the largest selection of books in the world by the middle of the 9th century. Notable scholars based in Baghdad during this time include translator Hunayn ibn Ishaq, mathematician al-Khwarizmi, and philosopher Al-Kindi.\n\nAlthough Arabic was used as the language of science, the scholarship involved not only Arabs, but also Persians, Syriacs, Nestorians, Jews, Arab Christians, and people from other ethnic and religious groups native to the region. These are considered among the fundamental elements that contributed to the flourishing of scholarship in the Medieval Islamic world. Baghdad was also a significant center of Islamic religious learning, with Al-Jahiz contributing to the formation of Mu'tazili theology, as well as Al-Tabari culminating in the scholarship on the Quranic exegesis. Baghdad is likely to have been the largest city in the world from shortly after its foundation until the 930s, when it tied with Córdoba. Several estimates suggest that the city contained over a million inhabitants at its peak. Many of the One Thousand and One Nights tales, widely known as the Arabian Nights, are set in Baghdad during this period. It would surpass even Constantinople in prosperity and size.\nAmong the notable features of Baghdad during this period were its exceptional libraries. Many of the Abbasid caliphs were patrons of learning and enjoyed collecting both ancient and contemporary literature. Although some of the princes of the previous Umayyad dynasty had begun to gather and translate Greek scientific literature, the Abbasids were the first to foster Greek learning on a large scale. Many of these libraries were private collections intended only for the use of the owners and their immediate friends, but the libraries of the caliphs and other officials soon took on a public or a semi-public character.\n\nFour great libraries were established in Baghdad during this period. The earliest was that of the famous Al-Ma'mun, who was caliph from 813 to 833. Another was established by Sabur ibn Ardashir in 991 or 993 for the literary men and scholars who frequented his academy. This second library was plundered and burned by the Seljuks only seventy years after it was established. This was a good example of the sort of library built up out of the needs and interests of a literary society. The last two were examples of madrasa or theological college libraries. The Nezamiyeh was founded by the Persian Nizam al-Mulk, who was vizier of two early Seljuk sultans. It continued to operate even after the coming of the Mongols in 1258. The Mustansiriyya Madrasa, which owned an exceedingly rich library, was founded by Al-Mustansir, the second last Abbasid caliph, who died in 1242. This would prove to be the last great library built by the caliphs of Baghdad.\n\nStagnation and invasions (10th–16th centuries)\nBy the 10th century, the city's population was between 1.2 million and 2 million. Baghdad's early meteoric growth eventually slowed due to troubles within the Caliphate, including relocations of the capital to Samarra (during 808–819 and 836–892), the loss of the western and easternmost provinces, and periods of political domination by the Iranian Buwayhids (945–1055) and Seljuk Turks (1055–1135). The Seljuks were a clan of the Oghuz Turks from Central Asia that converted to the Sunni branch of Islam. In 1040, they destroyed the Ghaznavids, taking over their land and in 1055, Tughril Beg, the leader of the Seljuks, took over Baghdad. The Seljuks expelled the Buyid dynasty of Shiites that had ruled for some time and took over power and control of Baghdad. They ruled as Sultans in the name of the Abbasid caliphs (they saw themselves as being part of the Abbasid regime). Tughril Beg saw himself as the protector of the Abbasid Caliphs.\n\nBaghdad was captured in 1394, 1534, 1623 and 1638. The city has been sieged in 812, 865, 946, 1157, 1258 and in 1393 and 1401, by Tamerlane. In 1058, Baghdad was captured by the Fatimids under the Turkish general Abu'l-Ḥārith Arslān al-Basasiri, an adherent of the Ismailis along with the 'Uqaylid Quraysh. Not long before the arrival of the Saljuqs in Baghdad, al-Basasiri petitioned to the Fatimid Imam-Caliph al-Mustansir to support him in conquering Baghdad on the Ismaili Imam's behalf. It has recently come to light that the famed Fatimid da'i, al-Mu'ayyad al-Shirazi, had a direct role in supporting al-Basasiri and helped the general to succeed in taking Mawṣil, Wāsit and Kufa. Soon after, by December 1058, a Shi'i adhān (call to prayer) was implemented in Baghdad and a khutbah (sermon) was delivered in the name of the Fatimid Imam-Caliph. Despite his Shi'i inclinations, Al-Basasiri received support from Sunnis and Shi'is alike, for whom opposition to the Saljuq power was a common factor.\n\nOn 10 February 1258, Baghdad was captured by the Mongols led by Hulegu, a grandson of Genghis Khan (Chingiz Khan), during the siege of Baghdad. Many quarters were ruined by fire, siege, or looting. The Mongols massacred most of the city's inhabitants, including the caliph Al-Musta'sim, and destroyed large sections of the city. The canals and dykes forming the city's irrigation system were also destroyed. During this time, in Baghdad, Christians and Shia were tolerated, while Sunnis were treated as enemies. The sack of Baghdad put an end to the Abbasid Caliphate. It has been argued that this marked an end to the Islamic Golden Age and served a blow from which Islamic civilization never fully recovered.\nAt this point, Baghdad was ruled by the Ilkhanate, a breakaway state of the Mongol Empire, ruling from Iran. In August 1393, Baghdad was occupied by the Central Asian Turkic conqueror Timur (\"Tamerlane\"), by marching there in only eight days from Shiraz. Sultan Ahmad Jalayir fled to Syria, where the Mamluk Sultan Barquq protected him and killed Timur's envoys. Timur left the Sarbadar prince Khwaja Mas'ud to govern Baghdad, but he was driven out when Ahmad Jalayir returned.\n\nIn 1401, Baghdad was again sacked, by Timur, a Central Asian Turko-Mongol figure. When his forces took Baghdad, he spared almost no one, and ordered that each of his soldiers bring back two severed human heads. Baghdad became a provincial capital controlled by the Mongol Jalayirid (1400–1411), Turkic Kara Koyunlu (1411–1469), Turkic Ak Koyunlu (1469–1508), and the Iranian Safavid (1508–1534) dynasties.\n\nOttoman and Mamluks (16th–19th centuries)\nThe Safavids took control of the city in 1509 under the leadership of Shah Ismail I. It remained under Safavid rule until the Ottomans seized it in 1535, but the Safavids regained control in 1624. A massacre occurred when the Shah's army entered the city. It remained under Safavid rule until 1639 when Sultan Murad IV recaptured it in 1638.\nIn 1534, Baghdad was captured by the Ottoman Empire, becoming the administrative capital of Ottoman Iraq. Under the Ottomans, Baghdad continued into a period of decline, partially as a result of the enmity between its rulers and Iranian Safavids, which did not accept the Sunni control of the city. Between 1623 and 1638, it returned to Iranian rule before falling back into Ottoman hands. Baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague and cholera, and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out. The city became part of an eyalet and then a vilayet.\nFor a time, Baghdad had been the largest city in the Middle East. The city saw relative revival in the latter part of the 18th century, under Mamluk government. Direct Ottoman rule was reimposed by Ali Rıza Pasha in 1831. From 1851 to 1852 and from 1861 to 1867, Baghdad was governed, under the Ottoman Empire by Mehmed Namık Pasha. The Nuttall Encyclopedia reports the 1907 population of Baghdad as 185,000.\nThe city's municipality was established in 1868, and Ibrahim al-Daftari was appointed its first mayor. The year 1869 is of great importance in the history of Baghdad in the Ottoman era, as it was the beginning of what can be considered a distinct era of the Ottoman eras, the foundations of which were laid by Governor Midhat Pasha, who implemented a number of reform systems and laws that the state legislated during the era of reforms and reconstruction, which was called the Tanzimat era. The overall importance of Baghdad to the Ottomans was that they made the headquarters of the Sixth Corps of the Ottoman Army in the city.\nBy the 19th century, Baghdad emerged as a leading center for Jewish learning. The city had Jewish population of over 6,000 and had numerous yeshivas. The Jewish population has grown so rapidly that by 1884, there were 30,000 Jews in Baghdad and by 1900, around 50,000, comprising over a quarter of the city's total population. Large-scale Jewish immigration from Kurdistan to Baghdad continued throughout this period. By the mid-19th century, the religious infrastructure of Baghdad grew to include a large yeshiva which trained up to sixty rabbis at time. Religious scholarship flourished in Baghdad, which produced great rabbis, such as Joseph Hayyim ben Eliahu Mazal-Tov, known as the Ben Ish Chai (1834–1909) or Rabbi Abdallah Somekh (1813–1889). During this time, Baghdadi Jews established a successful trade diaspora in China, India and Singapore.\n\nModern era\nBaghdad and southern Iraq remained under Ottoman rule until 1918, when they were captured by the British during World War I. In 1920, a revolt erupted in Baghdad against new British policies. It began in summer with mass demonstrations by Iraqis, including protests by embittered officers from the old Ottoman Army. The revolt gained momentum and spread to the middle and lower Euphrates. The British authorities retaliated by air bombing across Baghdad, which killed thousands of residents. In 1921, under the Mandate of Mesopotamia, Baghdad became the capital of the British-protected monarchy. Baghdad was made capital of the independent kingdom of Iraq in 1932.\nSeveral architectural and planning projects were commissioned to reinforce this administration. During this period, the substantial Jewish community (probably exceeding 100,000 people) comprised between a quarter and a third of the city's population. The National Museum of Iraq and the University of Baghdad were built by King Faisal, who laid foundation for the modern Iraqi state. The city's population grew from an estimated 145,000 in 1900 to 580,000 in 1950. A development plan came in 1957, visioned by Frank Lloyd Wright. The plan proposed to build a cultural hub on an island on the river, with an opera house, museums, a university, shopping malls, and a 300-foot statue of the fifth Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid.\nOn 1 April 1941, members of the \"Golden Square\" led by former minister Rashid Ali al-Gaylani staged a coup in Baghdad and installed a pro-German and pro-Italian government to replace the pro-British government of Regent Abd al-Ilah. The British forces intervened in the resulting Anglo-Iraqi War. Fearing the advancement, Gaylani and his government had fled, and the mayor of Baghdad surrendered to the British and Commonwealth forces. On 1–2 June, during the ensuing power vacuum, Jewish residents were attacked following rumors they had aided the British. In what became known as the Farhud, over 180 Jews were killed and 1,000 injured, 900 Jewish homes were destroyed, and hundreds of Jewish properties were ransacked. Many Jewish girls were raped and children maimed in front of their families. Between 300 and 400 non-Jewish rioters were killed in the attempt to quell the violence. Between 1950 and 1951, Jews were targeted in series of bombings. According to Avi Shlaim, Israel was behind bombings.\n\nOn 14 July 1958, a significant portion of the Iraqi Army under Abdul-Karim Qasim, staged a coup to topple the Kingdom of Iraq. The army seized control over Baghdad and stormed the radio station and the Al-Rehab Palace. Many people were brutally killed during the coup, including King Faisal II, former Regent Abd al-Ilah and former Prime Minister Nuri al-Said and members of the royal family. Many of the royal figures' bodies were dragged through the streets and mutilated. Mob violence emerged and several foreign nationals staying at the Baghdad Hotel, including Americans and Jordanians were killed. New principles were adopted for the city's development. New Baghdad and Sadr City were developed during the reign of Qasim. In 1960, Baghdad hosted an international conference with dignitaries from Iran, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, that founded Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).During the 1970s, Baghdad experienced a period of prosperity and growth because of a sharp increase in the price of petroleum, Iraq's main export. New infrastructure including oil pipelines, modern sewerage, and highways were built. Master plans of the city (1967 and 1973) were delivered by the Polish planning office Miastoprojekt-Kraków, mediated by Polservice. Saddam Hussein sponsored architectural and artwork events, that attracted world's popular architects. The city had a vibrant lifestyle. Baghdad was called as \"Nuremberg of 1930s\" and \"Las Vegas of the 1980s\".\nHowever, the Iran–Iraq War of the 1980s was a difficult time for the city, as money was diverted to the military and thousands of residents endured devastations. Iran launched a number of missiles and rockets on Baghdad, some of them hitting dangerously close to Al-Rashid Street and the Jewish Quarter. Power plants and oil refineries were damaged. A nuclear reactor near Baghdad was destroyed in an airstrike by Israel. Despite the war, preparations were underway for Baghdad to host a Non-Alignment Movement summit. Conference centers and hotels such as Palestine Hotel, Al-Mansour Hotel and Ishtar Hotel were built. However, the summit was later shifted to New Delhi, due to deteriorating security.\nDuring the Gulf War, Baghdad was the most heavily defended area of Iraq. Initially, U.S. airstrikes on Baghdad failed and resulted a tactical victory for the Iraqi Air Force. Later, the Coalition forces proceeded with aerial bombings. Air defense, communication systems, bridges, chemical weapon facilities, and artilleries were damaged. Oil refineries and airport were targeted. On 13 February 1991, an aerial bombing attack in Amiriya killed at least 408 civilians. Shortly after the end of the war, ethnic Kurds and Shi'a Muslims led uprisings against the government. Clashes took place Shi'a rebels and the Republican Guard led by Qusay Hussein. Sadr City was besieged until the order restored. Another uprising occurred in 1999, after Ayatollah Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr was assassinated in Najaf. Unrest began as large scale protests took place in Shia neighborhoods of Baghdad, specially Saddam City. The Republican Guard deployed in the district suppressed the demonstration, leaving between 27 and 100 dead.\nBaghdad was targeted in frequent U.S. airstrikes. On 26 June 1993, cruise missiles were launched into downtown Baghdad, targeting the intelligence headquarters in the Mansour district. The attack killed nine civilians nearby, including actress and painter Layla Al-Attar. During the 1998 bombing of Iraq, missiles struck multiple locations across Baghdad, including presidential palaces, several Republican Guard barrakcs, and offices of the Ministry of Defense and the Military industry. On February 16, 2001, the U.S. launched air strikes on five military targets at Taji.\n\n21st century (2001–present)\nThe city was economically drained, as a result of the Gulf War and the subsequent embargo against Iraq. By the end of the 1990s, the government made improvements and began rebuilding Baghdad. Government offices, presidential palaces, bridges and roads damaged in the war and follow-up U.S. attacks were restored. The city's airport was reopened, with flights from Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. Numerous mosques were built as a part of the Faith Campaign. In 2001, a broad initiative came to restore Baghdad's cultural heritage. Older mosques, churches, mandis and synagogues were restored and other historical structures were rebuilt. Under Saddam's architectural vision, a large number of palaces were built around the city. However, these efforts were interrupted by the war which began in 2003.\nIn 2003, the United States-led coalition invaded Iraq. Coalition forces launched massive aerial assaults. The resistance of the Iraqi Army of the city's airport delayed coalition's entry into Baghdad. Following the fall of Baghdad on 9 April 2003, the government lost its power. A statue of Saddam was toppled in Firdous Square, symbolizing the end of his rule. Many of the former government officials were either killed or captured, while others managed to escape and flee. After the overthrow the government, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was formed. CPA's decisions caused a power vacuum. Also two minor riots took place in 2003, on 21 July and 2 October, causing some disturbance in the population. Shortly after the invasion and the fall of the regime, an insurgancy began against the U.S-led rule of Iraq, consisting of former government officers and Islamist groups.\nBombings took place at Jordanian Embassy and Canal Hotel. Religious and ethnic minorities,— Christians, Mandaeans, and Jews, began leaving the city out of fear of being targeted in attacks, as they were subjected to kidnappings, death threats, and violence. The Iraqi Film Archives site was bombed, priceless collection of artifacts in the National Museum was looted, and thousands of ancient manuscripts in the National Library were destroyed. The Haifa Street helicopter incident on 12 September was controversial. On the eve of Ashura on 2 March 2004, one of the deadliest bombing took place in Baghdad, that killed at least 80–100 and injured 200 Shi'a Muslims. In 2005, over 965 people were killed in Al-Aimmah Bridge near Al-Kadhimiya Mosque. Attempts were made to rescue people, specially from the Sunni district of Adhamiyah, which is today seen as a symbol of unity.\nCoinciding the execution of Saddam Hussein in 2006, violence increased during the civil war between Shi'ite militias and Sunni insurgents. Shi'ite militias were Muqtada as-Sadr's Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) and the Iranian-backed Special Groups and among Sunni insurgents, the largest was Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). Sunni insurgents established their bases Mansour, Adhamiyah and Doura. Mansour district borders the Shi'ite populated Kadhimiyah and East Rasheed. Before 2003, it was home to wealthy Sunnis and Ba'athist officials. Hence, when the regime fell, it quickly became a stronghold for the Sunni insurgency. While Shia militias were based in Sadr City, Kadhimiyah, and West Rasheed, with Bab Al-Sharqi becoming stronghold for the Mahdi Army. Later, they also expanded into the surrounding districts of eastern Baghdad. 9 Nissan, Karadah, and Rusafa were dominated by Shias.\nUnder Operation Imposing Law (Operation Fardh al-Qanoon), the coalition forces and post-2003 Iraqi Army successfully defeated Al-Qaeda and targeted Shia militias. By 2009, the level of violence decreased. However, violence continued. The period surrounding Provincial Elections was remarkably peaceful. But Baghdad witnessed an uptick in attacks in early April 2009, when a series of suicide bomb and vehicle-borne improvised explosive device attacks were perpetrated across the capital.  The war and subsequent occupation ended in 2011, that caused huge damage to Baghdad's transportation, power, and sanitary infrastructure. It resulted in massive civilian casualties, whose number is disputed.\nThough the war ended, but an Islamist insurgency lasted until 2013. Baghdad experienced anti-government protests by Sunnis during the Arab Spring. It was followed by another war from 2013 to 2017 and a low-level insurgency from 2017, which included suicide bombings in January 2018 and January 2021. It has been site of clashes between the citizens and the government. The city attracted global media attention on 3 January 2020, when Iranian general Qasem Soleimani was assassinated in a U.S. drone strike near Baghdad Airport.  In December 2015, Baghdad was selected by UNESCO as the first Arab city of the center of literary creativity.\n\nGeography\nThe city is located on a vast plain bisected by the Tigris river. The Tigris splits Baghdad in half, with the eastern half being called \"Risafa\" and the Western half known as \"Karkh\". The land on which the city is built is almost entirely flat and low-lying, being of quaternary alluvial origin due to periodic large flooding of the Tigris river. The Diyala river is a tributary of the Tigris, flowing southeast of the city and bordering its eastern suburbs.\nBaghdad is 529.8 kilometres (329.2 mi) northwest of Basra, 402.9 kilometres (250.4 mi) south of Mosul, 366.8 kilometres (227.9 mi) south of Erbil and 103.8 kilometres (64.5 mi) northeast of Karbala. Located to the south is Mahmoudiyah, which serves as the gateway to Baghdad.\n\nClimate\nBaghdad has a hot desert climate (Köppen BWh), featuring extremely hot, prolonged, dry summers and mild to cool, slightly wet, short winters. In the summer, from June through August, the average maximum temperature is as high as 44 °C (111 °F) and accompanied by sunshine. Rainfall has been recorded on fewer than half a dozen occasions at this time of year and has never exceeded 1 mm (0.04 in). Even at night, temperatures in summer are seldom below 24 °C (75 °F). Baghdad's record highest temperature of 51.8 °C (125.2 °F) was reached on 28 July 2020. Humidity is under 50% in summer, due to Baghdad's distance from both the marshes in southern Iraq and the coasts of the Persian Gulf. Dust storms from the deserts to the west are a normal occurrence during the summer.\nIts winter temperatures are those of a hot desert climate. From December through February, Baghdad has maximum temperatures averaging 16 to 19 °C (61 to 66 °F), with highs possible above 21 °C (70 °F). Lows below freezing occur statistically a couple of times per year.\nAnnual rainfall, almost entirely confined to the period from November through March, averages approximately 150 mm (5.91 in), but has been as high as 338 mm (13.31 in) and as low as 37 mm (1.46 in). On 11 January 2008, light snow fell across Baghdad for the first time in 100 years. Snowfall was again reported on 11 February 2020, with accumulations across the city.\n\nGovernance\nAdministratively, Baghdad Governorate is divided into districts which are further divided into sub-districts. Municipally, the governorate is divided into 9 municipalities, which have responsibility for local issues. Regional services, however, are coordinated and carried out by a mayor who oversees the municipalities. The governorate council is responsible for the governorate-wide policy. These official subdivisions of the city served as administrative centers for the delivery of municipal services but until 2003 had no political function. Beginning in April 2003, the U.S—controlled Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) began the process of creating new functions for these. The process initially focused on the election of neighborhood councils in official neighborhoods, elected by neighborhood caucuses. The CPA convened a series of meetings in each neighborhood to explain local government, to describe the caucus election process and to encourage participants to spread the word and bring friends, relatives and neighbors to subsequent meetings.\nEach neighborhood process ultimately ended with a final meeting where candidates for the new neighborhood councils identified themselves and asked their neighbors to vote for them. Once all 88 neighborhood councils were in place, each neighborhood council elected representatives from among their members to serve on one of the city's nine district councils. The number of neighborhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighborhood's population. The next step was to have each of the nine district councils elect representatives from their membership to serve on the 37 member Baghdad City Council. Later, the number of official neighborhoods were increased to 89. This three tier system of local government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighborhood, through the district, and up to the city council. The same process was used to provide representative councils for the other communities in Baghdad Province outside of the city itself. There, local councils were elected from 20 neighborhoods (Nahia) and these councils elected representatives from their members to serve on six district councils (Qada).\nAs within the city, the district councils then elected representatives from among their members to serve on the 35 member Baghdad Regional Council. The first step in the establishment of the system of local government for Baghdad Province was the election of the Baghdad Provincial Council. As before, the representatives to the Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils in numbers proportional to the population of the districts they represent. The 41 member Provincial Council took office in February 2004 and served until national elections held in January 2005, when a new Provincial Council was elected. This system of 127 separate councils may seem overly cumbersome; however, Baghdad Province is home to approximately seven million people. At the lowest level, the neighborhood councils, each council represents an average of 75,000 people. The nine District Advisory Councils (DAC) are as follows:\n\nThe nine districts are subdivided into 89 smaller neighborhoods which may make up sectors of any of the districts above. The following is a selection (rather than a complete list) of these neighborhoods:\n\nNotable streets\nHaifa Street\nHilla Road – Runs from the north into Baghdad via Yarmouk (Baghdad)\nCaliphs Street – site of historical mosques and churches\nAl-Sa'doun Street – stretching from Liberation Square to Masbah\nAbu Nuwas Street – runs along the Tigris from the Jumhouriya Bridge to 14 July Suspended Bridge\nDamascus Street – goes from Damascus Square to the Baghdad Airport Road\nMutanabbi Street – A street with numerous bookshops, named after the 10th century Iraqi poet Al-Mutanabbi\nRabia Street\n14 July Street (Mosul Road)\nMuthana al-Shaibani Street\nBor Saeed (Port Said) Street\nThawra Street\nAl-Qanat Street – runs through Baghdad north-south\nAl-Khat al-Sare'a – Mohammed al-Qasim (high speed lane) – runs through Baghdad, north–south\nIndustry Street runs by the University of Technology – center of the computer trade in Baghdad\nAl Nidhal Street\nAl-Rasheed Street – city center Baghdad\nAl-Jumhuriya Street – city center Baghdad\nFalastin Street\nTariq al-Muaskar – (Al-Rasheed Camp Road)\nAkhrot street\nBaghdad Airport Road\n\nDemographics\nBaghdad's population was estimated at 7.22 million in 2015. The surrounding metropolitan region's population is estimated to be 10,500,000. It is second largest city in the Arab world after Cairo and fourth largest metropolitan area in the Middle East after Tehran. At the beginning of the 21st century, some 1.5 million people migrated to Baghdad. The 2013–2017 civil war following the Islamic State's invasion in 2014 caused hundreds of thousands of Iraqi internally displaced people to flee to the city.\n\nEthnicity\nThe vast majority of Baghdad's ethnic population are Iraqi Arabs, while minority groups include Kurds, Feyli, Kurdish, Turkmen, Assyrians, Kawliya, Circassians, Mandaeans, and Armenians. Post-2003 have left an impact of Baghdad's ethnic composition. In 2003, approximately 500,000 Kurds lived in Baghdad. As of 2016, around 300,000 remained in Baghdad. Among them, about 150,000 are Shi'a mostly of Luri origin. The main Kurdish neighborhood is situated in central Baghdad, known as the Quarter of Kurds (Akd al–Akrad). It is itself home to more than 200 Kurdish families that have lived for generations.\nChristians in Baghdad are predominantly ethnic Assyrians and Armenians. Assyrians began moving to Baghdad by the mid 20th century from northern Iraq and Iran. The historic \"Assyrian Quarter\" of the city – Dora, which boasted a population of 150,000 Assyrians in 2003, made up over 3% of the capital's Assyrian population then.  The community has been subject to kidnappings, death threats, vandalism, and house burnings by al-Qaeda and other insurgent groups. As of the end of 2014, only 1,500 Assyrians remained in Dora and others in Karrada district. Before the war, 25,000 Armenians lived in Iraq, with majority them concentrated in Baghdad. Although the Armenian population has reduced, Baghdad is still home to the largest community of Armenians in Iraq, primarily concentrated in the Armenian quarter of Bab al-Sharqi area.\nAn estimated 60,000 Iraqi Turkmen live in Baghdad, with significant population in the neighborhoods of Adhamiyah and Ragheba Khatun. There is a Circassian neighborhood in the city, which is home to the largest Circassian community of Iraq. The metropolitan area and the adjoining governorate is also home to Kawliya, African Iraqis,  Chechens and other groups.\n\nReligion\nThe majority of the citizens are Muslims with minorities of Christians, Yezidis, Jews and Mandeans also present. There are many religious centers distributed around the city including mosques, churches, synagogues and Mashkhannas cultic huts. The city historically has a predominantly Sunni population, but by the early 21st century around 52% of the city's population were Shi'ites. Sunni Muslims make up 29–34% of Iraq's population and they are still a majority in west and north Iraq. As early as 2003, about 20% of the population of the city was the result of mixed marriages between Shi'ites and Sunnis. Following the civil war between Sunni and Shia militia groups during the occupation of Iraq, the population of Sunnis significantly decreased as they were pushed out of many neighborhoods. Today majority of the neighborhoods are either entirely Sunni or Shi'ite. While few localities are mixed, such as Yarmouk.\nThe Christian community in Baghdad is divided among various denominations, mainly the Chaldean Catholic Church and the Syriac Catholic Church. There is also a significant presence of followers of the Assyrian Church of the East and the Syriac Orthodox Church, along with the largest Armenian Apostolic and Protestant communities in Iraq, which is also located in Baghdad. The city serves as the headquarters of the Chaldean Catholic Church, with its see located in the Cathedral of Our Lady of Sorrows, while the Ancient Church of the East has its see in the Cathedral of the Virgin. Before the Iraq War in 2003, Baghdad was home to 300,000–800,000 Christians, primarily concentrated in several neighborhoods with a Christian majority or significant minority, the most notable being Karrada and al–Dora, which had around 150,000 Christians. After 2003, a large number of Christians were displaced in wars and many of them fled to Baghdad after ISIS's takeover of Mosul. Today about 100,000 Christians remained in Baghdad, primarily in Karrada and Mansour district.\nBaghdad was once home to one of the world's most significant Jewish communities. In 1948, Jews numbered approximately 150,000, constituting 33% of the city's population. Persecution forced most Jews to flee Iraq. Even after 1948, up to 100,000 Jews remained, which decreased. Majority of 15,000 Iraqi Jews lived in Baghdad during Saddam Hussein's rule and their population dwindled, not due to persecution but because of lifted travel restrictions that allowed many to emigrate. By 2003, Iraq still had a Jewish community of about 1,500 people, majority of whom resided in Baghdad. But the population decreased sharply after the war. Today, an estimated 160 Jews live in Baghdad out of spotlight, primarily in the old Jewish quarters of Bataween and Shorja, which was once home to vibrant Jewish community. The city was historically home to over 60 synagogues, cemeteries, and shrines, many of which were preserved before 2003. However, their condition deteriorated after the war, and only a few sites, such as the Meir Taweig Synagogue and Al-Habibiyah Jewish Cemetery, remain today.\n\nBeyond their traditional homelands, around Amarah and Basra, Mandaeans are also found in Baghdad. By the late 20th century, Mandaeans began settling in Baghdad for better opportunities. Most of them live primarily around al-Qadisiyah and Dora, which is location to their place of worship and cultural centers. However, persecution of Mandaeans have been greatly decreased since 2003.  There is also a small of community of Baha'is and Sikhs, who live in Baghdad. The Sikhs are mostly Indians. Before 2003, Baghdad was regularly visited by Sikh pilgrims from India.\n\nEconomy\nBaghdad serves as the commercial and financial hub, home to 22% of the population, and generating 40% of the Iraq's GDP. It connects trade routes between Turkey, Syria, India, and Southeast Asia. As the capital, it hosts government institutions and state enterprises, key sources of employment. The public education system follows Ba'athist socialist ideologies, for employment in the public sector. Since 2003, the public sector has struggled to provide jobs, and the private sector hasn't grown sufficiently, leading companies to hire mainly foreigners. To address this, NGOs are establishing incubation centers in the city.\nBaghdad serves as headquarters for important companies of Iraq, such as Iraq National Oil Company, State Organization for Marketing of Oil and Iraqi Airways. Baghdad is home to large insurance companies and banks — Central Bank of Iraq, Rafidain Bank, and Rashid Bank and regional headquarters for First Abu Dhabi Bank, Fransabank and Saudi National Bank. Multinational companies such as Honeywell, Shell, General Electric, SalamAir and Robert Bosch GmbH have established their regional base. Baghdad is also home to Iraq Stock Exchange, that was established in 1992. Most of these establishments are located in Al-Rasheed Street, Karrada and Mansour district.\nIt was once one of the main destinations in the region with a wealth of cultural attractions. Tourism has diminished due to wars, but in recent years the city has a revival in tourism although still facing challenges. There are numerous historic, scientific and artistic museums in Baghdad. Religious tourism in Baghdad has grown since 2003, with sites like Al-Kadhimiya Mosque, Abu Hanifa Mosque, Mausoleum of Abdul-Qadir Gilani, and Buratha Mosque attracting visitors from Iran, Pakistan, and India, while non-religious tourists mainly come from Turkey, France, and the United States. Around 1 million people visit the city annually for religious purposes. The pilgrims are both Shia and Sunni Muslims.\nThe city contains the factories of carpets, leather and textiles, workshops, cement and tobacco factories. Industrial areas extend from the city center to outside and suburbs in the metropolitan area, such as Taji and northern Baghdad. Subsequently, it has produced a wide variety of consumer and industrial goods, including processed foods and beverages, clothes, footwear, wood products, furniture, paper and printed material, bricks, chemicals, plastics, electrical equipment, and metal and nonmetallic products. Bismayah, southeast of Baghdad, is home to world's largest precast factory. In agricultural aspect, palm groves are spread in the city, and many of its people depends on the cultivation of many yields.\nBaghdad, like other provinces such as Babylon, Karbala and Qadissiya, contains metals such as aluminum, ceramics, nickel, manganese and chromium, whose size is not yet known, being recently discovered by local Iraqi cadres lacking experience and mechanisms to determine the size of these explorations. An oilfield is located in eastern Baghdad. It was believed that the quantities of oil is modest, but the drilling disclosed that its size exceeds the initial estimates, and has northern extensions in the province of Salah al-Din, and southern province of Wasit. The city is also home to Dora Refinery, a large oil refinery in Dora, which is the 3rd largest in Iraq in terms of production. The production of it exceeds 200,000 barrels (32,000 m3) per day, while its total production estimated if it was developed up to 120,000 barrels (19,000 m3) per day.\nMost reconstruction efforts have been devoted to the restoration and repair of badly damaged urban infrastructure. Some of the private projects includes  Baghdad Renaissance Plan, Sindbad Hotel Complex and Conference Center, and Central Bank of Iraq Tower. Other project proposed includes Romantic Island and Baghdad Gate. Numerous projects have been also impacted due to corruption. According to a report published by CNBC, there are around 150 entertainment projects planned for the city. Many of them were delayed due to government policies. Also Baghdad has witnessed the opening of dozens of tourist complexes annually with areas reaching 20,000 square metres (4.9 acres) in addition to some major tourism projects with areas exceeding 50,000 square metres (12 acres) with the aim of investment combining trade and tourism as a distinctive economic model. In recent years, Baghdad has also adopted modern economic trends like, establishment of startup hubs, office space and incubation center, as well as development of shopping malls such Baghdad Mall and Dijlah Village.\n\nTransportation\nBaghdad lacks substantial public transportation, and taxis are the primary means of transportation in the city. Roads in Baghdad have been known to be especially congested since at least 2003. According to MP Jassim Al-Bukhati in 2021, \"Baghdad's roads are designed to accommodate 700,000 cars, while now there are between 2.5 and 3 million cars on them\". This is because, since 2003, car imports have increased. Since then, river-based water transport has become a popular mode of transport. Use of boats crossing across the river saves time for travelers escaping congestion. Private organizations are working to improve the transport system.\nAmong the major bridges connecting Karkh and Rusafa are 14th of July Bridge, Al-Aimmah Bridge and Al-Sarafiya Bridge. In 2023, the authorities announced plans to build 19 bridges in Baghdad. This is a part of its post-war reconstruction efforts, as many bridges were damaged during the war. Streets, avenues and alleys form an important part of the transport network. Al-Sa'doun Street stretches from Liberation Square to Masbah. Abu Nuwas Street runs along the Tigris from the Jumhouriya Bridge to 14 July Suspended Bridge. Damascus Street goes from Damascus Square to the Baghdad Airport Road. Hilla Road runs from the north into Baghdad via Yarmouk. Mutanabbi Street is a street with numerous bookshops, named after the 10th century Iraqi poet Al-Mutanabbi. Caliphs Street is the site of historical mosques and churches.\n\nAir transport\nIraqi Airways, the national airline of Iraq, operates out of Baghdad International Airport in Baghdad. The airport was opened by Saddam Hussein in 1982 as Saddam International Airport. It was closed as result of the Gulf War and subsequent embargo. The airport was reopened in August 2000. The airport adopted its current name after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nPlanned Baghdad Metro\nThe Baghdad Metro project was first proposed during the 1970s but did not come to fruition due to wars and sanctions. After the Iraq war, Iraqi authorities intended to revive the project, but it was again delayed due to domestic instability. In 2019, it was reported that Korean Hyundai and French Alstom would be building the metro. However, the planned construction did not happen.\nAs of February 2024, the current plan consisted of fully electric and automated (driverless) trains running on an extensive railway network including an underground railway portion as well as an elevated railway. The proposed Baghdad Metro system includes seven main lines with a total length of more than 148 kilometres, 64 metro stations, four workshops and depots for trains, several operations control centers (OCC) and seven main power stations (MPS) with a capacity of 250 mega-watts, and several Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) towers. The metro will be equipped with CCTV and internet as well as USB ports for charging. Special compartments will be allocated for women and children as well as seats for people with special needs, pregnant women, and the elderly. The metro stations will be connected to other public transport networks such as buses and taxis, and 10 parking spaces will be available for commuters. The planned operating speed will be 80–140 km/hour with an estimated 3.25 million riders per day.\nIn July 2024, it was announced that an international consortium of German French, Spanish, and Turkish companies was awarded $17.5 billion contract to construct Baghdad's metro. The consortium includes Alstom, Systra, SNCF, Talgo, Deutsche Bank and SENER. The consortium was then to negotiate the technical, financial and operational details of the project which is now estimated to be completed in May 2029.\n\nCityscape\nThe Round City was the core of the city, during the establishment of Baghdad. It ceased to exist, as a result of the Mongolian siege. Urban features such as streets, avenues, alleyways and squares clusters a large number of landmarks, which itself creates an identity of cultural or intellectual hubs and define the beauty of Baghdad.\nAl-Rasheed Street is one of the most significant landmarks in Baghdad. Located in al-Rusafa area, the street was an artistic, intellectual and cultural center for many Baghdadis. It also included many prominent theaters and nightclubs such as the Crescent Theatre where Egyptian Singer Umm Kulthum sang during her visit in 1932 as well as the Chakmakji Company that recorded the music of various Arab singers. The street also contains famous and well-known landmarks including the ancient Haydar-Khana Mosque as well as numerous well-known cafés such as al-Zahawi Café and the Brazilian Café.\nMutanabbi Street is located near the old quarter of Baghdad; at Al-Rasheed Street. It is the historic center of Baghdadi book-selling, a street filled with bookstores and outdoor book stalls. It was named after the 10th-century classical Iraqi poet Al-Mutanabbi. This street is well established for bookselling and has often been referred to as the heart and soul of the Baghdad literacy and intellectual community. Firdos Square is a public open space in Baghdad and the location of two of the best-known hotels, the Palestine Hotel and the Sheraton Ishtar, which are both also the tallest buildings in Baghdad. The square was the site of the statue of Saddam Hussein that was pulled down by the coalition forces in a widely televised event during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nQushla or Qishla is a public square and the historical complex located in al-Rusafa neighborhood at the riverbank of Tigris. The place and its surroundings is where the historical features and cultural capitals of Baghdad are concentrated, from the Mutanabbi Street, Abbasid-era palace and bridges, Ottoman-era mosques to the Mustansariyah Madrasa. The square developed during the Ottoman era as a military barracks. Today, it is a place where the citizens of Baghdad find leisure such as reading poetry in gazebos. It is characterized by the iconic clock tower which was donated by George V. The entire area is submitted to the UNESCO World Heritage Site Tentative list.\n\nArchitecture\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Saddam Hussein's government spent a lot of money on new monuments, mosques, palaces and hotels. The Street is also notable for its architecture and aesthetic which was inspired by Renaissance architecture and also includes the famous Iraqi shanasheel.\n\nModern Landmarks\nThe National Museum of Iraq whose collection of artifacts was looted during the invasion, and the iconic Hands of Victory arches. Multiple political parties are in discussions as to whether the arches should remain as historical monuments or be dismantled. Thousands of ancient manuscripts in the National Library were destroyed under Saddam's command.\nGrand Festivities Square is the main square where public celebrations are held and is also the home to three important monuments commemorating Iraqi's fallen soldiers and victories in war; namely Al-Shaheed Monument, the Victory Arch and the Unknown Soldier's Monument. Al-Shaheed Monument, also known as the Martyr's Memorial, is a monument dedicated to the Iraqi soldiers who died in the Iran–Iraq War. However, now it is generally considered by Iraqis to be for all of the martyrs of Iraq, especially those allied with Iran and Syria fighting ISIS, not just of the Iran–Iraq War. The monument was opened in 1983, and was designed by the Iraqi architect Saman Kamal and the Iraqi sculptor and artist Ismail Fatah Al Turk. Though these works symbolize the ruling entity. Neverthelsess, they have remained part of architectural legacy, which beautified Baghdad.\nMasjid Al-Kadhimain is a shrine that is located in the Kādhimayn suburb of Baghdad. It contains the tombs of the seventh and ninth Twelver Shi'ite Imams, Musa al-Kadhim and Muhammad at-Taqi respectively, upon whom the title of Kādhimayn (\"Two who swallow their anger\") was bestowed. Many Shi'ites travel to the mosque from far away places to commemorate those imams. A'dhamiyyah is a predominantly Sunni area with a Mosque that is associated with the Sunni Imam Abu Hanifa. The name of Al-Aʿẓamiyyah is derived from Abu Hanifa's title, al-Imām al-Aʿẓam (the Great Imam).\nThe historic Jewish quarters of Bataween and Shorja is home to numerous sites that are associated with Jews. These sites were preserved during the Ba'athist regime. However, after 2003, many of them are in poor conditions. Meir Taweig Synagogue is the only active synagogue of Iraq, which have a large compound, that consist of community center, Jewish school and library. Daniel Market (Souq Danial), which was named after Menahem Saleh Daniel, still bears the same name. It is popular for fabrics and shoes. The Great Synagogue of Baghdad, the oldest synagogue of Iraq, is now restored as a museum. Al-Habibiyah Cemetery is the largest Jewish cemetery in Baghdad, home to around 1,000 graves. The Tomb of Joshua, now a Muslim shrine, is believed to be the burial site of Joshua. Shaykh Yitzhak Tomb and Synagogue was preserved until 2003. Today it is neglected. Other sites includes House of Sassoon Eskell and library of Mir Basri.\nThe Sabian–Mandaean Mandi of Baghdad is a Mandaen temple in al-Qadisiyyah. It is the main community center for Mandaeans in Iraq. Plans are underway to demolish and build a larger one to accommodate more worshippers. A cultural institute for Mandeans is also in Baghdad. The city is home to Baba Nanak Shrine, a sacred site in Sikhism. It was destroyed during the Iraq War in 2003. In the Kadhimiya district of Baghdad, was the house of Baháʼu'lláh, (Prophet Founder of the Baha'i Faith) also known as the \"Most Great House\" (Bayt-i-Aʻzam) and the \"House of God\", where Baháʼu'lláh mostly resided from 1853 to 1863. It is considered a holy place and a place of pilgrimage by Baha'is according to their \"Most Holy Book\". On 23 June 2013, the house was destroyed under unclear circumstances.\n\nBaghdad Zoo used to be the largest zoological park in the Middle East. Within eight days following the 2003 invasion, however, only 35 of the 650 animals in the facility survived. This was a result of theft of some animals for human food, and starvation of caged animals that had no food. Conservationist Lawrence Anthony and some of the zoo keepers cared for the animals and fed the carnivores with donkeys they had bought locally. Eventually Paul Bremer, Director of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq after the invasion, ordered protection for the zoo and enlisted U.S. engineers to help reopen the facility. Al-Zawraa Park is also part of the zoo, which is main urban park of the city.\n\nEducation\nThe House of Wisdom was a major academy and public center in Baghdad. The Mustansiriya Madrasa was established in 1227 by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mustansir. The name was changed to al-Mustansiriya University in 1963. The University of Baghdad is the largest university in Iraq and the second largest in the Arab world. Prior to the Gulf War, multiple international schools operated in Baghdad, including:\n\nÉcole française de Bagdad\nDeutsche Schule Bagdad\nBaghdad Japanese School (バグダッド日本人学校), a nihonjin gakko\n\nUniversities\nUniversity of Baghdad\nMustansiriya University\nIraqi University\nNahrain University\nAlbayan University\nUniversity of Technology\nAmerican University of Iraq - Baghdad\nAl-Turath University College\nDijlah University College\n\nCulture\nBaghdad has always played a significant role in the broader Arab cultural sphere, contributing several significant writers, musicians and visual artists. Historically, the city had a vibrant modern culture and lifestyle. Famous Arab poets and singers such as Nizar Qabbani, Umm Kulthum, Fairuz, Salah Al-Hamdani, Ilham al-Madfai and others have performed for the city. The dialect of Arabic spoken in Baghdad today differs from that of other large urban centers in Iraq, having features more characteristic of nomadic Arabic dialects (Versteegh, The Arabic Language). It is possible that this was caused by the repopulating of the city with rural residents after the multiple sackings of the late Middle Ages. For poetry written about Baghdad, see Reuven Snir (ed.), Baghdad: The City in Verse (Harvard, 2013). Baghdad joined the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature in December 2015.\nSome of the important cultural institutions in the city include the National Theater, which was looted during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, but efforts are underway to restore the theater. The live theater industry received a boost during the 1990s, when UN sanctions limited the import of foreign films. As many as 30 movie theaters were reported to have been converted to live stages, producing a wide range of comedies and dramatic productions. Institutions offering cultural education in Baghdad include The Music and Ballet School of Baghdad and the Institute of Fine Arts Baghdad. The Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra is a government funded symphony orchestra in Baghdad. The INSO plays primarily classical European music, as well as original compositions based on Iraqi and Arab instruments and music. Mandaeans had cultural club in Al-Zawraa, where poetry evenings and cultural seminars were held, attended by poets, writers, artists, officials, and dignitaries of the communities. There is also a social cultural center of Mandaeans at al-Qadisiyyah. Baghdad Jewish Community Center is located in Al-Rashid Street.\nBaghdad is also home to a number of museums which housed artifacts and relics of ancient civilization; many of these were stolen, and the museums looted, during the widespread chaos immediately after United States forces entered the city.\nDuring occupation of Iraq, AFN Iraq (\"Freedom Radio\") broadcast news and entertainment within Baghdad, among other locations. There is also a private radio station called \"Dijlah\" (named after the Arabic word for the Tigris River) that was created in 2004 as Iraq's first independent talk radio station. Radio Dijlah offices, in the Jamia neighborhood of Baghdad, have been attacked on several occasions.\n\nSport\nBaghdad is home to some of the most successful football (soccer) teams in Iraq, the biggest being Al-Shorta (Police), Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya (Air Force), Al-Zawraa, and Al-Talaba (Students). The largest stadium in Baghdad is Al-Shaab Stadium, which was opened in 1966. In recent years, the capital has seen the building of several football stadiums which are meant be opened in near future. The city has also had a strong tradition of horse racing ever since World War I, known to Baghdadis simply as 'Races'. There are reports of pressures by the Islamists to stop this tradition due to the associated gambling.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nCairo, Egypt\n Baku, Azerbaijan\n Pyongyang, North Korea\n Tehran, Iran\n Amman, Jordan\n Damascus, Syria\n Beirut, Lebanon\n Jerusalem (East), Palestine\n Bucharest, Romania\n\nSee also\nIraqi art\nList of mosques in Baghdad\nList of places in Iraq\nHistory of the Jews in Baghdad\nBattle of Baghdad (2003)\nBaghdad Ziyarat Tour\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nDefrémery, C.; Sanguinetti, B.

          "summary": "Baghdad is the capital and largest city in Iraq. It is located on the banks of the Tigris in central Iraq. The city has an estimated population of 8 million. It ranks among the most populous and largest cities in the Middle East and the Arab world and constitutes 22% of the country's population. Baghdad is a primary financial and commercial center in the region.\nFounded in 762 AD by Al-Mansur, Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate and became its most notable development project. The city evolved into an intellectual and cultural center. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the House of Wisdom, as well as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious environment, garnered it a worldwide reputation as the \"Center of Learning\". For much of the Abbasid era, during the Islamic Golden Age, Baghdad was one of the largest cities in the world and rivaled Chang'an, as the population peaked at more than one million. It was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues, shift in power and multiple successive empires. Later, Baghdad served as the administrative center of Ottoman Iraq, exercising authority over the provinces of Basra, Mosul, and Shahrizor.\nDuring the First World War, Baghdad was made the capital of Mandatory Iraq. With the recognition of Iraq as an independent monarchy in 1932, it gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of Arab culture. During the Ba'ath Party rule, the city experienced a period of relative prosperity and growth. However, it faced severe infrastructural damage due to the Iraq War, which began with the invasion of Iraq in 2003, resulting in a substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts. During the insurgency and renewed war from 2013 to 2017, it had one of the highest rates of terrorist attacks in the world. However, these attacks have gradually declined since the territorial defeat of the Islamic State militant group in Iraq in 2017, and are now rare. Since the end of the war, numerous reconstruction projects have been underway to induce stability.\nIraq's largest city, Baghdad is the seat of government. It generates 40% of the economy of Iraq. A major center of Islamic history, Baghdad is home to numerous historic mosques, as well as churches, mandis and synagogues, highlighting the city's historical diversity. Religious sites such as Masjid al-Kadhimayn, Buratha Mosque, the Shrine of Abdul-Qadir Gilani and Abu Hanifa Mosque are visited by millions of people annually. It was once home to a large Jewish community and was regularly visited by Sikh pilgrims from India. Baghdad is a regional cultural hub. The city is well known for its coffeehouses.",

          "content": "بَغْدَاد هيَ عَاصِمَه جُمْهُوريَّه العِرَاق، ومَرْكَزُ محافظه بَغْدَاد. في عام 2016 بلغَ عَددُ سُكانها حَوالي 8.5 مَليون نَسَمه، مَا يَجعَلها اكبر مَدِينه في العِرَاق وثانِي اكبر مَدِينه في الوَطَنِ العَرَبي بَعْد القَاهِرهِ. وتاتي بالمَرتبه 40 عالميًا من حيث عدد السكان. وتُعد المَدِينه المَركز الاقْتِصَاديّ والادَاريّ والتَعليمِيّ في الدَّوْلَه.\nبناها الخليفه العباسي ابو جعفر المنصور في القرن الثامن الميلادي واتخذها عاصمهً للدوله العباسيه؛ اصبح لبغداد بعدها مكانه عظيمه، فكانت اهم مراكز العلم على تنوعه في العالم وملتقى للعلماء والدارسين لعده قرون من الزمن. وتمثل بغداد حاليًا حالهً من حالات التتابع المدني في اطار موقع واحد، ففي اطار موقع الرافدين تتابعت العواصم من بابل القديمه الى سلوقيه الاغريقيه وطيسفون الفارسيه، التي كانت تعرف بمدائن كسرى، ثم بغداد العربيه الحاليه.\nكانت بغداد اكبر مدينه في العالم لمُعظم فَتره حُكْم بَنو العَباس خلال العصر الذهبي الاسلامي، بِحَيث بلغَ عَدد سُكانها اكثر من مِليون نَسمه. وصلت مدينه بغداد لذروتها في عصر الخليفه العباسي الخامس هارون الرشيد وارتبطت باسمه في روايات الف ليله وليله ذات الشهره العالميه، حيث باتت عاصمه العالم القديم. وقد فقدت هذه المكانه منذ عام 1258 عندما غزاها المغول والتتار. مع حلول بدايات القرن السادس عشر، تبادل الصفويون والعثمانيون السيطره على المدينه، حتى انتزعها العثمانيون اخيراً في عام 1535، فظلت تحت حكمهم قرابه 4 قرون. وفي عام 1917، سيطر الانجليز على المدينه، وقد خضعت كمعظم مناطق العراق الاخرى تحت الانتداب البريطاني، ثم اصبحت عاصمه للمملكه العراقيه عام 1921، والجمهوريه العراقيه عام 1958.\nتكمن اهميه موقع بغداد الجغرافي في توافر المياه وتناقص اخطار الفيضانات، ما ادى بدوره الى اتساع رقعه المدينه وزياده نفوذها الى جانب سهوله اتصالها عبر نهر دجله بواسطه الجسور التي تربطها عبر جوانب النهر، والذي يخترق مركزها لينصفه الى جُزْاَين هما الكرخ والرصافه. وتتشكل المدينه اليوم من 27 منطقه، تنقسم بدورها الى عده احياء.\nتمتاز بغداد باهميتها الثقافيه التي تتمثل بوجود عدد كبير من الصروح المهمه كالمتاحف والمدارس التاريخيه والمكتبات والمسارح. وتشتهر المدينه باثارها الاسلاميه التي تتمثل ببقايا اسوار مدينه بغداد، ودار الخلافه، والمدرسه المستنصريه. ولبغداد القديمه اسماء عده كالمدينه المدوره والزوراء ودار السلام.\n\nالتاريخ\nاظهرت التنقيبات الاثريه ان بغداد كانت في الفترات القديمه موطنًا بشريًا مهما يعود الى العصر الاشوري قبل اختيارها لتكون عاصمه للخلافه العباسيه. ومما جعل لهذا الموقع اهميته الجغرافيه والاستراتيجيه توسطه مدنًا حضاريه انسانيه كبرى تمتد من شمال العراق الى جنوبه. ان هذا الموقع الجغرافي التاريخي جعل بغداد تتبوا موقعًا متوسطًا بين تلك المدن الامر الذي شكل بيئه ملائمه لتطور الانسان وانجازاته الحضاريه والفكريه. وفي العصور التي سبقت الفتح الاسلامي وما بعده، كانت المنطقه التي عرفت في بغداد في العهد العباسي تحيط بها مدن لها اهميتها الاستراتيجيه والجغرافيه. وتقع مدينه بغداد شمال موقع مدينه بابل الاثريه، اضافهً الى انها تقع على بعد بضعه كيلومترات شمال غرب مدينه قطيسفون (المدائن) التي بناها الاغريق قبل الميلاد وورثها الفرس، والتي استمرت كمركز رئيس للبلاد حتى حلت محلها بغداد في القرن الثامن.\n\nبُنيت بغداد في العصر العباسي بين عاميّ 762 و 764 م. واُطلق عليها في القديم اسم الزوراء، ومدينه السلام، وكانت ذات يوم عاصمه الدنيا، ومركز الخلافه الاسلاميه العباسيه. بناها الخليفه العباسي ابو جعفر المنصور، وسماها مدينه المنصور، وجعل لها اربعهُ ابواب هي: باب خُراسان، (وكان يسمى باب الدوله)، وبابُ الشام، ثم بابُ الكوفهِ، ثم باب البصره. وكان المنصور قد اختار لها هذه البقعه من الارض على ضفتي نهر دجله. تزخرُ بغدادُ بالكثيرِ من المعالمِ التاريخيه والحضاريه، اهمها المدرسه المستنصريه، والمساجد الاسلاميه القديمه، والقصور الاثريه، وبها عدد من المقامات الدينيه، اهمها مقاما الامامين موسى الكاظم ومحمد الجواد بالكاظميه، ومقام ابي حنيفه النعمان، ومقام الشيخ عبد القادر الجيلاني وجامع الخلفاء العباسي المعروف قديمًا بجامع القصر او جامع الخليفه، وجامع الحيدرخانه وهو من اتقنِ جوامع بغداد صِنعه واحكامًا\nيوجد بالمدينه متاحف تعرض فيه الاثار المختلفه من جواهر وعملات وهياكل بشريه وتماثيل من عصور ما قبل التاريخ حتى القرن السابع عشر الميلادي.\n\nالعصر العباسي\nكان سبب بناء بغداد في العصر العباسي، ان ابو جعفر المنصور بنى الهاشميه قباله مدينه ابن هبيره بينهما عرض الطريق، وكانت مدينه ابن هبيره التي بحيالها مدينه ابي جعفر الهاشميه الى جانب الكوفه، وبنى المنصور ايضاً مدينه بظهر الكوفه سماها الرصافه. فلما ثارت الراونديه بابي جعفر في مدينته التي تسمى الهاشميه، كره سكناها لاضطراب من اضطرب امره عليه من الراونديه مع قرب جواره من الكوفه ولم يامن اهلها على نفسه فاراد ان يبعد من جوارهم فذكر انه خرج بنفسه يرتاد لها موضعاً يتخذه مسكناً لنفسه وجنده ويبتني به مدينه فبدا فانحدر الى جرجرايا ثم صار الى بغداد ثم مضى الى الموصل ثم عاد الى بغداد فقال هذا موضع معسكر صالح هذه دجله ليس بيننا وبين الصين شيء ياتينا فيها كل ما في البحر وتاتينا الميره من الجزيره وارمينيا وما حول ذلك وهذا الفرات يجيء فيه كل شيء من الشام والرقه وما حول ذلك فنزل وضرب عسكره على الصراه وخط المدينه ووكل بكل ربع قائدًا.\nاختار ابو جعفر المنصور موقع بغداد على رقعه مرتفعه من الارض على الجانب الغربي من نهر دجله عند مصب نهر الرفيل فيه والتي بدا العمل في بنائها بتاريخ الثالث والعشرين من تموز من عام سبعمئه واثنان وستين ميلاديه. وكانت تحيط بهذا الموقع قرى ماهوله السكان مزدهره اهمها: بغداد الباليه القديمه، وسونيا الاراميه، والخطابيه، وشرفانيه، وبناورا، وورثاه، وبراثا، وقطغتا، والوردانيه. وكان هناك جسر على دجله، و دير للنصارى. وكانت الارض التي تحيطها سهله زراعيه تسقيها مياه ترع تتفرع من نهر الرفيل الواسع الذي ياخذ من نهر الفرات ويبعد عن بغداد نحو 30 كيلومترا، ومن نهر الدجيل الذي ياخذ مياهه من دجله في شماليها. وهذه الاراضي المزروعه كانت واسعه تنتج محاصيل زراعيه وافره، ويقابلها في شرقي دجله اراض منبسطه ايضاً تروي مزارعها انهار وترع عده.\nمن جهه اخرى، ذُكر عن عيسى بن المنصور انه قال: \"وجدت في خزائن ابي المنصور في الكتب انه انفق على مدينه السلام وجامعها وقصر الذهب بها والاسواق والفصلان والخنادق وقبابها وابوابها اربعه الاف الف وثمانمئه وثلاثين درهماً ومبلغها من الفلوس مئه الف الف فلس وثلاثه وعشرون الف فلس وذلك ان الاستاذ من البنائين كان يعمل يومه بقيراط فضه والروزكاي بحبتين الى ثلاث حبات. وكانت مدينه بغداد مدوره ويبلغ طول قطرها نحو 2615 مترا، واحيطت بخندق وسورين بينهما ساحه واسعه. ورسم في داخلها سكك (شوارع او ازقه) عديده على كل منها عدد من الطاقات، وكل هذه السكك مستقيمه تمتد من السور الى رحبه واسعه في وسط المدينه المدوره، وخص المنصور ابا حنيفه النعمان بالاشراف عليها فكان المشرف العام على بنائها اربعه اعوام، وعندما انتهى البناء نقل مجالس علمه اليها، حتى توفي في عام 150 هـ.\n\nبتولِي هارون الرشيد الحكم بدا عصر زاهر كان واسطه العقد في تاريخ الدوله العباسيه التي دامت اكثر من خمسه قرون، ارتقت فيه العلوم، وسمت الفنون والاداب، وعمَّ الرخاء ربوع الدوله الاسلاميه. ولقد امسك هارون الرشيد بزمام هذه الدوله وهو في نحو الثانيه والعشرين من عمرهِ، فاخذ بيدها الى ما ابهر الناس من مجدها وقوتها وازدهار حضارتها.\n\nاصدر الرشيد عند توليه الخلافه عفوا عاما امن كل من كان هاربا او مستخفيا عدا بعض الزنادقه.\nوانشا بما يعرف ببيت الحكمه في بغداد وزوّدها باعداد كبيره من الكتب والمؤلفات من مختلف بقاع الارض. وكانت تضم غرفًا عديده تمتد بينها اروقه طويله، وخُصصت بعضها للكتب، وبعضها للمحاضرات، وبعضها الاخر للناسخين والمترجمين والمجلدين. كما تمت في عهده اول ترجمه الى العربيه لاشهر كتاب علمي عرف في التاريخ وهو \"كتاب الاصول (الاركان) في الهندسه والعدد لاقليدس ، وتطورت العلوم خصوصًا الفيزياء الفلكيه والتقنيه، وابتكرت عدد من الاختراعات كالساعه المائيه. كما انشئ في عهده اول مصنع للورق ببغداد سنه 795 م وصار سوق الوراقين لاحقا الذي يضم مئات الحوانيت التي تبيع السلع الورقيه الفاخره مفخره عاصمه العباسيين وكان ورق بغداد يقدر تقديرا عاليا في المنطقه حتى ان بعض المصادر البيزنطيه تسمي الورق بصحف بغداد (Bagdatixon) في ربط مباشر بينه وبين مدينه بغداد\nانشا الخليفه العباسي هارون الرشيد اكبر مستشفى في بغداد، سماها باسمه، ضمت في كادرها امهر الاطباء، وتولى ادارتها كل من يوحنا بن ماسويه وجبريل بن بختيشوع، وكانت اشهر مستشفى في العالم القديم.\nاهتم هارون الرشيد بالاصلاحات الداخليه فبنى المساجد الكبيره والقصور الفخمه وفي عهده استعملت القناديل لاول مره في اضاءه الطرقات والمساجد. اعتنى الرشيد ايضًا بالزراعه واسس نظامها، فبنت حكومته الجسور والقناطر الكبيره وحفرت الترع والجداول الموصله بين الانهار، واسس ديوانًا خاصًا للاشراف على تنفيذ تلك الاعمال الاصلاحيه، ومن اعماله ايضًا تشجيع التبادل التجاري بين الولايات وحراسه طرق التجاره بين المدن، وقد شيّد مدينه الواقفه قرب مدينه الرقه على ضفاف الفرات لتكون مقرًا صيفيًا لحكمه.\nغدت بغداد قبله طلاب العلم من جميع البلاد، يرحلون اليها حيث كبار الفقهاء والمحدثين والقراء واللغويين، وكانت المساجد الجامعه تحتضن دروسهم وحلقاتهم العلميه التي كان كثير منها اشبه بالمدارس العليا، من حيث غزاره العلم، ودقه التخصص، وحريه الراي والمناقشه، وثراء الجدل والحوار. كما جذبت المدينه الاطباء والمهندسين وسائر الصناع. وكان الرشيد نفسه يميل الى اهل الادب والفقه والعلم، حتى ذاع صيت الرشيد وطبق الافاق ذكره، وارسلت بلاد الهند والصين واوروبا رسلها الى بلاطهِ تخطب وده، وتطلب صداقته.وقع خلاف بعد عامين من وفاه الرشيد بين ولديه الامين والمامون، وحوصرت بغداد لاول مره في تاريخها ودام الحصار اربعه عشر شهراً. وفي نهايه عام 812 اطبق جند هرثمه وطاهر قائدي المامون على الامين في بغداد وعزل هرثمه الجانب الشرقي الذي لم يكن يحميه سوى سور سرعان ما ازاله، بينما عسكر طاهر امام باب الانبار فسيطر بذلك على الجانب الغربي، ووجد الخليفه نفسه اخر الامر منعزلاً في قصر الخلد على شاطئ دجله وما لبث ان وقع في الاسر وهو يحاول الفرار وقُتل في اوائل عام 814، وبموته رُفع الحصار واصبحت بغداد المزدهره خرائب ورماداً، واثار موت الامين سخط اهل بغداد، وتمكن ابراهيم بن المهدي العباسي بفضل الخلاف بين الناس من ان يستولي على بغداد ويصبح صاحب الامر فيها ما يقرب من عامين غير ان خيانه قواده اجبرته على تسليم المدينه وزمام الحكم الى الخليفه المامون. وكانت بطانه المامون من الفرس تحاول نقل عاصمه الخلافه الى خراسان ليتم لهم التغلب على شئون الدوله، وتولى الحسن بن سهل العراق والحجاز واليمن فاضطرب حبل الامن ودبت الفتن في بغداد الى ان دخلها المامون عام 820، وعادت لبغداد شيء من نضرتها الى ان ادركته منيته عام 834، وقد عهد المامون بالخلافه من بعده لاخيه المعتصم، وظلت بغداد تموج بالفتن حتى انه في عام 1157 لم يبقَ من تلك المملكه المتراميه الاطراف الا بغداد واعمالها وقليل مما يتصل بها. وقد انتقلت العاصمه العباسيه في زمن المعتصم عام 837 من بغداد الى سامراء، وقد اعادها الخليفه العباسي المعتمد عام 893 الى بغداد، واقام في دار الخلافه بالجانب الشرقي من نهر دجله.\nفي منتصف القرن العاشر، استولى ال بويه على بغداد، والذين يرجع نسبهم الى ملوك الفرس الساسانيين. وقد كان ذلك الاستيلاء في عام 945 بقياده احمد معز الدوله، والذي اعلن نفسه حاميا على الخلافه حتى 1055، حيث كان حكم الخليفه في بغداد صوريًا. وقد شجّع البويهيون على نشر المذهب الشيعي في المنطقه. تصارعت فروع الاسره فيما بينها فعمت الاضطرابات ارجاء الدوله. انتهى الامر بان قُسمت دوله الى فرعين، اولهما في العراق والاخر في كرمان. قضى الغزنويون على فرع البويهيين في الري سنه 1023، ثم انهى السلاجقه ما تبقى من دولتهم وحلوا محلهم في بغداد.\nينتمي السلاجقه الى احدى العشائر المتزعمه لقبائل الغز التركيه. وقد توسعت الدوله السلجوقيه في انحاء مختلفه من تركيا وايران، حتى استولت على العراق سنه 1055، بعد القضاء على دوله البويهيين في بغداد، واعلنوا نفسهم كحاميين للخلافه العباسيه. وقد استمر حكمهم لاراضٍ شاسعه حتى قضى عليهم الخوارزمشاهات سنه 1194.\n\nالمغول والتتار\nكان المغول تحت قياده جنكيز خان قد دمروا ولايه خوارزم شاه عند وفاه الخليفه ابو العباس احمد الناصر لدين الله في 1225، واحتلوا معظم اقسام ايران الشماليه. تمكن جيش الخليفه العباسي المستنصر، حفيد الناصر من دحر الهجوم المغولي على اراضي العراق العربيه. وتحت حكم ابنه المستعصم، حاصر المغول بغداد في 1245 دون تحقيق نجاح. الا ان الفيضانات الفظيعه التي حدثت في الاعوام 1243، 1253، 1255 و 1256 خلخلت دفاعات المدينه، وخيرات المنطقه وثقه المواطنين.\nفي عام 1258، طُوقت بغداد بقوه مغوليه كبيره يقودها هولاكو، حفيد جنكيزخان، الذي كان قد اُرسل من منغوليا خصوصًا لكي يتعامل مع العباسيين. وقد سقطت المدينه في 10 شباط/ فبراير 1258، كما اندلعت في اثنائها نيران فتن داخليه انتهت باستيلاء التتار عليها وبقتل الخليفه المستعصم واولاده ورجال حاشيته واهل بطانته، وباستباحه بغداد مده طويله، وكانت بغداد حين حاصرها المغول غاصه باهل الاطراف من الذين اجفلوا امام الجيش المغولي الذين لم يرحموا شيخاً ولا طفلاً ولا امراه، وبهذا افلت شمس الخلافه العباسيه في بغداد بعد ان اشرقت عليها اكثر من خمسه قرون، وكان افولها كارثه على الامم الاسلاميه كافه. وقد ابقى هولاكو في اول الامر الاوضاع الاداريه في بغداد على النمط العباسي تقريباً، ورتب جماعه من الرقباء والامناء ليشرفوا على كل شيء، وبذلك اصبحت حكومه بغداد مدنيه تحت اشراف حكومه عسكريه.\n\nلقد دمّر المغول معظم مدينه بغداد فعليا، ويُقال ان 800,000 نسمه من سكانها قد ابيدوا. كما خُفضت منزله المدينه اداريا الى مركز ولايه. اما بقيه المدن في المنطقه العربيه من العراق مثل الحله والكوفه والبصره فقد رضخت الى شروط الغازي وابقيت على حالتها. اما الموصل في شمال العراق فقد اصبحت عاصمه ولايه دياربكر وديار ربيعه. كانت هاتان الولايتان تابعتين مثل المناطق العربيه في العراق الى سياسه دوله الخان الثانيه المغوليه، والتي كان مقرها في اذربيجان، التي بدورها كانت تابعه الى دوله الخان العظيم في الصين.\nلقد خلفت بغداد مدن عده في المنطقه مثل تبريز، والتي ظهرت كمركز تجاري رئيس وقاعده سياسيه في المنطقه. اخذ حكم المغول في بغداد والموصل عموما طابع الحكم المشترك الذي يشمل الاداريين المدنين من المسلمين والمسيحين واليهود يسندهم امر معسكر المغول. وبصوره عامه فان العراق مر بفتره من الانهيار السياسي والاقتصادي استمر لغايه القرن السادس عشر.\nفي منتصف القرن الرابع عشر، حكم الجلائريون بغداد. وهم احد العشائر المغوليه، لكنها تنتمي الى تجمع قبائل مختلف عن الذي ينحدر منه جنكيز خان، كما كان مواطنهم في بلاد ما وراء النهر. وقد انتزع الشيخ حسن برزك السلطه في بغداد سنه 1336، ثم حكم بصفه مستقله منذ 1340. تنازعت هذه السلاله مع القائد المغولي تيمورلنك لحكم العراق، مما ادى به الى غزو بغداد وطردهم منها سنه 1393. وقد عاد الجلائريون مره اخرى سنه 1395 الى المدينه، ثم كانت النتيجه ان عاد اليها تيمورلنك، ودمرها عن اخرها سنه 1401. عاد الجلائريون مجددا الى بغداد سنه 1406، فقامت قبائل القراقويونلو (الخراف السود) التركمانيه باجلاء اخر الجلائريين عن بغداد سنه 1411. بقي للاسره حكام في كل من البصره وخراسان، واستمروا حتى سنه 1432، عندما قضى التركمان عليهم نهائيًا. وظلت بغداد تحت الحكم التركماني من هذا التاريخ حتى عام 1509.\n\nالصفويون والعثمانيون\nسيطر الصفويون على المدينه في عام 1509 بقياده الشاه اسماعيل الصفوي. وبقيت تحت حكم الصفويين حتى انتزعها العثمانيون من يد الصفويين عام 1535، ولكن ما لبث الصفويون ان عادوا ليسيطروا عليها عام 1624م، وحدثت فيها مذبحه عند دخول جيش الشاه، وبقت تحت الحكم الصفوي حتى عام 1639م، حيث دخلها السلطان العثماني مراد الرابع عام 1638م.\n\nمن جهه اخرى، شهدت بغداد في الفتره الممتده من 1749 – 1831 حكم مماليك العراق حيث لم يكن للعثمانيين دور مباشر في حكم العراق. وقد بلغت دوله المماليك في العراق اوج قوتها في عهد سليمان باشا الكبير والذي دام حكمه 22 عاما (انظر: تاريخ بغداد بعد سقوط المماليك).\nكانت بغداد تحت الحكم العثماني مركزا لاياله بغداد ابتداء من عام 1535 وحتى عام 1864، حيث اصبحت بعدها مركزا لولايه بغداد. وقد تاسست بلديه المدينه في عام 1868، كما تم تعيين ابراهيم الدفتري اول رئيس بلديه لها. وتمثل سنه 1869 اهميه كبيره في تاريخ بغداد في العصر العثماني، حيث بدا فيها ما يمكن اعتباره عهدًا متميزًا من عهود العثمانيين وضع اسسه الوالي مدحت باشا بتطبيقه لعدد من الانظمه والقوانين الاصلاحيه التي شرعتها الدوله خلال عهد الاصلاحات واعاده البناء الذي اطلق عليه عهد التنظيمات. وكان من مُجمل اهميه بغداد للعثمانيين ان جعلوا مقر الفيلقِ السادس في الجيش العثماني في المدينه. وقد بقيت بغداد تحت الحكم العثماني حتى سقوط الدوله العثمانيه وقدوم الانجليز في عام 1917.\n\nالانتداب البريطاني\nكان اول نزول للقوات البريطانيه على ارض العراق في شهر ايلول/ سبتمبر سنه 1914 من منطقه الفاو، وهي بلده تقع اقصى الجنوب تطل على الخليج العربي. وقد ارسلت القوات البريطانيه من الهند بقصد ازاحه العثمانيين عن الخليج وحمايه منشات النفط في جنوب غرب ايران. حتى وصلت بغداد بعد جهود وخسائر كبيره بعد اكثر من سنتين ونصف السنه، دافعت خلالها القوات العثمانيه دفاعاً مستميتًا.\nوفي يوم الاحد 11 اذار/ مارس 1917، سقطت بغداد بقياده الجنرال البريطاني ستانلي مود، بعد سلسله من الانتصارات في يد الجيش البريطاني خلال القتال مع الاتراك العثمانيين في الحرب العالميه الاولى، كما وقعت بغداد كمعظم مناطق العراق الاخرى تحت الانتداب البريطاني.\nلم تمر الا سنوات قليله حتى انتشرت الروح الوطنيه بين العراقيين للتحرر من السيطره البريطانيه بسبب قرار الحكومه البريطانيه ربط العراق بالكومنولث البريطاني، وقرارها بتشكيل الاداره المدنيه في العراق، التي تراسها السير ارنولد ويلسون حتى ايار 1918 فتبعه السير بيرسي كوكس الذي الغى العديد من المؤسسات الاداريه العثمانيه، وانشا محلها مؤسسات عسكريه لاداره الشؤون المدنيه، ووضع على راسها ضباطًا من رتب عاليه، فحكموا بشكل صارم، وتصرفوا مع العراقيين بشكل مهين. فكان لتلك التصرفات ردود افعال معاكسه من قبل العراقيين، مما ادى الى انطلاق ثوره شعبيه عام 1920 لتمتد في كل اجزاء العراق، سُميت بثوره العشرين، وقد استمرت سته اشهر تقريباً.\n\nالتاريخ المعاصر\nاصبحت بغداد عاصمه لمملكه العراق بعد عام 1921. وقد مُنح العراق الاستقلال رسميًا في عام 1932، وزاد استقلاله في عام 1946. ازداد عدد سكان المدينه من 145,000 المقدر في عام 1900 الى 580,000 في عام 1950.\nقام اعضاء في «المربع الذهبي» في 1 نيسان/ ابريل 1941، ورشيد عالي الكيلاني بانقلاب في بغداد. عمل رشيد علي تثبيت حكومه مواليه للالمان وايطاليا المؤيدتان لاستبدال حكومه عبد الاله بن علي الهاشمي المواليه لبريطانيا. في 31 ايار/ مايو، بعد الثوره وبعد فرار رشيد علي وحكومته، استسلم رئيس بلديه بغداد للقوات البريطانيه والكومنولث. حدثت عقب الفوضى التي اعقبت سقوط حكومه رشيد عالي الكيلاني خلال انقلاب 1941 اعمال عنف ونهب نشبت في بغداد بالعراق واستهدفت سكان المدينه من اليهود في 1 حزيران/ يونيو 1941 خلال احتفالهم بعيد الشفوعوت اليهودي،  قبل ان تتمكن القوات البريطانيه من السيطره على المدينه. انتهت الحادثه في اليوم التالي لدى دخول البريطانيين بغداد وراح ضحيتها حوالي 175 قتيلا و 1،000 جريحا يهوديا، كما تم تدمير حوالي 900 منزلا تابعا لليهود.\nتركت هذه الحادثه اثرا عميقا لدى اليهود العراقيين وساعدت على سرعه هجرتهم الى فلسطين. فبحلول عام 1951 هاجر اكثر من 80% منهم من العراق.\nفي 14 تموز/ يوليو 1958، قام افراد من الجيش العراقي بقياده عبد الكريم قاسم بانقلاب للاطاحه بمملكه العراق. تم اعلان قيام الجمهوريه العراقيه وانتهاء حقبه العهد الملكي من خلال البيان الاول للحركه والذي اذاعه عبد السلام عارف من دار الاذاعه، وذلك بعد نجاحه في قلب نظام الحكم وقتل الملك فيصل الثاني، وقاموا بالسيطره على القياده العامه للجيش ودار الاذاعه ومجمع بداله الهاتف المركزي، من خلال قطاعات اللواء العشرين الذي تحت امرته.\nفي 17 تموز/ يوليو 1968، قام حزب البعث العربي الاشتراكي بالتحالف مع ضباط بعثيين بانقلاب على الرئيس عبد الرحمن عارف الذي استلم الحكم بعد وفاه اخيه عبد السلام عارف. وقد تم تعيين احمد حسن البكر رئيسا لمجلس قياده الثوره ورئيساً للجمهوريه وقائدًا عامًا للجيش واصبح صدام حسين نائب رئيس مجلس قياده الثوره، كما اصبح نائب رئيس الجمهوريه في عام 1972. يصف الكثير من العراقيين فتره البكر بالعصر الذهبي لبغداد، اذ قام العراق بتاميم النفط والقضاء على الامٌيه والبطاله.\nاستلم الرئيس صدام حسين الحكم في عام 1979. وسرعان ما ادخل البلاد في حرب مع ايران دامت ثماني سنوات ابتداءً من عام 1980. ولم تدم فتره السلم الا عامين حتى غزى الكويت عام 1990، لتبدا حرب الخليج الثانيه على العراق بقياده قوات التحالف. وقد تم تدمير الكثير من البنى التحتيه للعاصمه بغداد من طرق وجسور وحتى محطات توليد الكهرباء. كما تم بعدها فرض حصار اقتصادي على العراق دام لمده 13 عام حتى سقوط حكم حزب البعث في العراق عام 2003.\n\nالاحتلال الامريكي\n\nشنّت الولايات المتحده حربًا على العراق في عام 2003 بحجه وجود اسلحه للدمار الشامل. وبعد ثلاثه اسابيع من بدايه الحمله، بدات القوات الامريكه تحركها نحو العاصمه بغداد. كان التوقع الاولي ان تقوم القوات المدرعه الامريكيه بحصار المدينه وتقوم بحرب شوارع في بغداد باسناد من القوه الجويه الامريكيه، خاصه بعد المعارك التي حدثت مع القوات العراقيه في الجنوب.\nاعلنت القوات الامريكيه في 9 نيسان/ ابريل 2003 بسط سيطرتها على معظم المناطق بعد انهيار الدفاعات العراقيه بشكل مفاجئ، ونقلت وكالات الانباء مشاهد لحشد صغير يحاولون الاطاحه بتمثال للرئيس العراقي صدام حسين في وسط ساحه الفردوس، والتي قاموا بها بمساعده من ناقله دبابات امريكيه وقام المارينز بوضع العلم الامريكي على وجه التمثال ليستبدلوه بعلم العراق فيما بعد، بعد ان ادركوا ان للامر رموزًا ومعاني قد تثير المشاكل. وقد تولى القائد العسكري الامريكي تومي فرانكس قياده العراق في تلك الفتره باعتباره القائد العام للقوات الامريكيه.\nتسبب هذا الغزو باضرار كبيره في بغداد شملت جميع القطاعات بما فيها النقل، الطاقه، البنيه التحتيه والصحه. ولا تزال المدينه تعاني من نتائج هذه الحرب الى اليوم.\nالوضع الحالي\nبدا انسحاب القوات الامريكيه من العراق في عام 2009، واستمر لعامين، حيث غادر اخر جندي امريكي البلاد في 18 كانون الاول/ ديسمبر 2011. وقد اتى هذا الانسحاب بعد ضغوط داخليه وخارجيه على الاداره الامريكيه، حيث خسرت الولايات المتحده خلال احتلالها للعراق 4474 قتيلاً و 33 الف جريح حسب الارقام الرسميه، كما انفقت حوالي تريليون دولار. من جهه اخرى، عانى العراق من تبعات هذا الانسحاب سياسيًا وامنيًا. وقد شهدت بغداد عددًا كبيرًا من التفجيرات التي تلت هذا الانسحاب، نتيجه الخروقات الامنيه.\n\nالتسميه\nتجمع المصادر التاريخيه ان الخليفه العباسي الثاني ابوجعفر المنصور قد قرر بناء عاصمه له تليق بمكانه الدوله الاسلاميه المتصاعده، فاختار بعد تدقيق وتمحيص موقعًا على نهر الصرا بين نهري دجله والفرات، حيث كانت تقوم قريه تسمى بغداد. كان يجتمع فيها تجار البلاد في راس كل شهر. وتجمع المصادر على ان اسم القريه الاصليه في ذلك الموقع هو (بغداذ) و (بغدان) او تبدل الباء ميمًا فيصير الاسم (مغداد) او (مغدان). وهذه الاسماء كلها ممنوعه من الصرف ولكنها تقبل التذكير والتانيث، فتقول (هذا بغداد) و (هذه بغداد). ويشتق منها الفعل «تبغدد» او «تبغدن» بمعنى سكن بغداد او تشبه باهلها.\nوسماها بانيها ابوجعفر المنصور (مدينه السلام) وهو الاسم الرسمي الذي ظهر في وثائق الدواوين العباسيه وعلى النقود والاوزان. كما اطلقت على المدينه اسماء اخرى مثل (دار السلام) و (مدينه المنصور) و (مدينه الخلفاء) و (المدينه المدوره) و (عاصمه الرشيد) و (الزوراء). ولكن الاسم القديم (بغداد) هو الذي ظل عالقًا في اذهان الناس ويتردد على السنتهم، فاحتفظت المدينه بذلك الاسم حتى يومنا هذا.\nالمعنى الفارسي لاسم مدينه بغداد\nكانت اللغه الفارسيه هي اللغه الرسميه والمعتمده في العراق منذ سقوط الدوله البابليه عام 539 ق.م الى مجيئ الفتح الاسلامي باستثناء فترات قصيره خضع فيها العراق لاحتلال الاغريق ثم الرومان. وكانت قريه بغداد الاصليه قائمه اثناء الحكم الساساني للعراق. وهكذا جاء اقدم المؤرخين الذين تطرقوا الى اسم مدينه بغداد مثل المقدسي وابن رسته بتفسيرات مستمده من اللغه الفارسيه لاسم بغداد. وقد ترددت تلك التفسيرات في كتب المؤرخين اللاحقين. واكثر هذه التفسيرات شيوعا هو القائل ان (باغ) تعني بستان بالفارسيه و (داد) تعني عطيه، فيكون معنى الاسم (البستان العطيه)، او (باغ) اسم صنم او شيطان و (داد) عطيه او هبه فيكون المعنى (عطيه الصنم). وقد قرب بعض المعاصرين المعنى فقال انها تعني (هبه الله). فلا غرابه في ان البكري (ت 487 هجري) قد ضمن اسم بغداد في مصنفه المعروف باسم معجم ما استعجم لانه عد الاسم اعجميا واردفه بمعناه العربي.\nالمعنى السومري والاكدي لاسم مدينه بغداد\nكشفت الحفريات الاثاريه في موقع بغداد عن واجهه كبيره مبنيه بالاجر البابلي وعليها اسم الملك البابلي الشهير نبوخذنصر (605 - 562 ق.م) والقابه. من ناحيه اخرى، وجدت وثائق بابليه تحمل اسم بلده (بغداد) تعود احداها، وهي وثيقه قضائيه الى ايام الملك البابلي حمورابي (1792 - 1750 ق.م) صاحب مسله القوانين البابليه الشهيره.وهكذا فان اسم (بغداد) كان قد اُستعمل قبل الف عام على الاقل من دخول كلمه (باغ) بمعنى الصنم او الاله_الرب الى اللغه الاراميه وعند العوده الى المعجم الذي اصدره الدكتور بهاءالدين الوردي للغه السومريه، نجد ان بغداد تعني (قلعه قبيله الصقر) او (هيكل الصقر)  وهذا مايؤيده عالم الاشوريات الفرنسي لابات في معجمه الخاص بالعلامات الاكديه.\nاسماء بغداد الاخرى\nلقد اختلف مؤرخو مدينه بغداد حتى في معنى اسمها العربي الواضح (مدينه السلام). فراى بعضهم ان المقصود بالسلام هو الله. ويرى بعضهم ان المنصور اسماها مدينه السلام، لان نهر دجله يقال له (وادي السلام). ويرى بعضهم الاخر ان المنصور اسماها (مدينه السلام) تفاؤلا في انها ستكون امنه مطمئنه. فالسلام شرط اساسي لازدهار المدن ورفاهيتها.\nاما مدينه المنصور ومدينه الخلفاء والمدينه المدوره والزوراء فهي اوصاف لبغداد استخدمها الخاصه والعامه في نعت المدينه. فتسميه (مدينه المنصور) هي تعريف للمدينه باضافتها الى بانيها ، وكذلك (مدينه الخلفاء) تعريفٌ لها باضافتها الى ساكنيها بعد تعاقب عدد من الخلفاء العباسيين على الاقامه فيها. و (المدينه المدوره) نعت للمدينه يميزها عن غيرها من المدن، ظنًا من الناعتين بانها المدينه الوحيده التي بنيت على شكل دائره. و (الزوراء) نعت كذلك، اُطلق عليها لان الابواب الداخليه لاسوارها مزوره عن الابواب الخارجيه، اي ليست على سمتها كما يقول ياقوت الحموي. ويستخدم ترتيب مداخل ابواب السور على هذا الشكل المنحني او المنكسر لاغراض دفاعيه. ومن المحتمل ان هذه الطريقه قد استخدمت اول مره في بغداد  كما اورد الحميري (ت 900 هجريه) في كتابه (الروض المعطار في خبر الاقطار) حين قال: وكان بعضهم يسميها (الصياده) لانها تصيد القلوب.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع بغداد على خط عرض 33 وخط طول 44 على نهر دجله، في المنطقه الوسطيه للعراق، حيث تقع ما بين المدن الرئيسيه شمالاً وجنوبًا، فتبعد عنها البصره 445 كم الى الجنوب، بينما تقع شمالاً كل من الموصل على بعد 350 كم واربيل على بعد 320 كم.\nاما عن مدن الجوار، فيقع الى الغرب كل من دمشق على بعد 750 كم، عمّان على بعد 800 كم، بيروت على بعد 830 كم، القدس على بعد 875 كم والقاهره على بعد 1290 كم. وتقع جنوبا كل من الكويت على بعد 545 كم والرياض على بعد 980 كم. اما من الشرق فتقع طهران على بعد 700 كم، والى الشمال الغربي تقع انقره على بعد 1250 كم.\n\nالموقع والطبوغرافيا\nتقع مدينه بغداد على بعد 85 كم شمال موقع مدينه بابل الاثريه، وعلى بعد بضعه كيلومترات شمال غرب مدينه قطسيفون (المدائن) والتي استمرت كمركز رئيسي للبلاد حتى حلت محلها بغداد في اوائل العصر العباسي. في 30 تموز 762 كلٌف الخليفه المنصور ببناء المدينه، وكان البناء تحت اشراف البرامكه. اعتقد المنصور ان بغداد ستكون المدينه المثاليه لتكون عاصمه للامبراطوريه الاسلاميه تحت حكم العباسيين. اختار ابو جعفر بنفسه رقعه مرتفعه من الارض، على الجانب الغربي من دجله عند مصب نهر الرفيل فيه، وقرر ان يشيّد عاصمته الجديده على هذه الرقعه.\n\nتُعد بغداد اكبر مدن العراق وايضًا من كبريات مدن الشرق الاوسط وثاني اكبر مدينه عربيه معاصره بعد القاهره في مصر. ومدينه بغداد من المدن التي ترتبط بتاريخ الخلافه العباسيه ان لم يكن تاريخ العالم الاسلامي خلال القرون الخمسه من عام 150 هـ/767م الى 656 هـ/1258م، فكان ابو جعفر المنصور ثاني خليفه عباسي واول من اتخذ بغداد عاصمه له بعدما قضى على منافسيه من العباسيين والعلويين في عام 145 هـ 762م، وبنى ابو جعفر المنصور على نهر دجله عاصمته بغداد في عام (145 - 149 هـ) 710 ميلاديه على شكل دائري، وهو اتجاه جديد في بناء المدن الاسلاميه، لان مـعظم المدن الاسلاميه، كانت اما مستطيله كالفسطاط، او مربعه كالقاهره، او بيضاويه كصنعاء. ولعل السبب في ذلك يرجع الى ان هذه المدن نشات بجوار مرتفعات حالت دون استدارتها. ويُعتبر تخطيط المدينه المدوره (بغداد)، ظاهره جديده في الفن المعماري الاسلامي ولا سيما في المدن الاخرى التي شيّدها العباسيون مثل مدينه سامراء وما حَوته من مساجد وقصور خلافيه فخمه. والى جانب العماره وجدت الزخرفه التي وصفت بانهما لغه الفن الاسلامي، وتقوم على زخرفه المساجد والقصور والقباب باشكال هندسيه او نباتيه جميله تبعث في النفس الراحه والهدوء والانشراح. وسُمي هذا الفن الزخرفي الاسلامي في اوروبا باسم ارابسك.\n\nتمثل بغداد حاليًا حاله من حالات التتابع المدني في اطار موقع واحد ففي اطار موقع الرافدين تتابعت العواصم من بابل القديمه الى سلوقيه الاغريقيه وقطيسنون الفارسيه التي كانت تعرف بمدائن كسرى ثم بغداد العربيه الحاليه. لا تزال نواه بغداد القديمه موجوده حتى الان تنتشر حولها الاجزاء الحديثه حول البوابات الشماليه والجنوبيه القديمه على الجانب الغربي لنهر دجله على بعد 540 كم تقريبًا الى الشمال الغربي من الخليج العربي.\nوتكمن اهميه موقع بغداد في توافر المياه وتناقص اخطار الفيضانات مما ادّى بدوره الى اتساع رقعه المدينه وزياده نفوذها الى جانب سهوله اتصالها عبر دجله بواسطه الجسور التي تربطها بالجانب الايسر من النهر .\n\nاتجاه القبله\nاتجاه القِبله: 160° درجه من الشمال الى الغرب (جنوب الغرب).\nالمسافه ما بين مكه وبغداد: 1399 كم\n\nمناطق بغداد\nينقسم مركز العاصمه الى صوبَيْن (جانبين) هما الكرخ على الجانب الغربي لنهر دجله، والرصافه على الجانب الشرقي للنهر وفي كلا الجزئين نجد المباني الحديثه وعلى جانب الرصافه توجد منطقه الكراده ذات الشوارع الضيقه والمحلات الكثيره ويقصدها معظم سكان بغداد للتبضع، انّ بعض اسماء مناطق بغداد هي قديمه من تراث بغداد كسبع ابكار، وقد ذُكر تفسير معانيها في كتب وبعض اسماءها حديثه كحي الخضراء، وفي عام 1908م اتخذت الحكومه العثمانيه اسماءً جديدهً لمحلات بغداد وشوارعها. وفي تشرين الاول عام 2000، اُعلنَ في بغداد عن مبادره حكوميه لتغيير بعض اسماء مناطق بغداد وشوارعها تنفيذاً لمقاصد «حمله الانسجام بين المكان والحاضر والماضي»، ومن ذلك تغييرُ شارع كورنيش الاعظميه من اسم شارع بيرم التونسي الى شارع امرؤ القيس اذ رات لجنه الاسماء ان شارع الكورنيش يتوافق مع الرومانسيه المعهوده من امرؤ القيس، وذكر مسؤول اللجنه ان الاسماء «بعضها لا ينسجم مع الذوق العام لانها استمدت اسمائها من حادث او شخصيه»، وبيّنَ ان مقياس الاختيار ليس بشهره الاسم في مكانه بل يُنتقى «من التاريخ العربي والعراقي القديم والمعاصر»، وقال ان بعض المناطق لم تكن لها اسماء فاختاروا لها تسميه، واقرّ بوجود اسماء رسميه لا يعرفها الناس بسبب تجاهل الدوائر الحكوميه لاستعمال تلك الاسماء. وفي 1 حزيران عام 2017 اعلنَ مجلس محافظه بغداد عن تغيير اسم شارع ابن تيميه في جنوب الوزيريه الى شارع الشافعي. الجدول التالي يبين ببعض مناطق بغداد الرئيسيه:\n\nالمناطق الصناعيه في بغداد\nتمتد المناطق الصناعيه من مركز بغداد الى خارجها وضواحيها مثل الحي الصناعي في البياع، ومنطقه التاجي الصناعيه شمال المدينه.\n\nالمناخ\nيُعتبر مناخ بغداد مناخ صحراوي، حيث يتميز الصيف في العراق بارتفاع درجات الحراره. وقد لازم ارتفاع درجات الحراره في بغداد خلال السنوات الاخيره ظاهره هبوب العواصف الترابيه الخفيفه. ويعلل الخبراء شده هذه الظواهر في صيف بغداد بعد الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003، الى الاحتباس الذي يعانيه الجو في البلاد وازدياد نسبه الكربون في الجو نتيجه عوادم المولدات الكهربائيه، وازدياد ظاهره التصحر، وانجراف التربه، والجفاف، وتغيير البيئه العراقيه ككل نتيجه الاهمال المتعمد وعدم وضع الحلول العاجله.\nوتوجد في محافظه بغداد محطه رصد جوي واقعه في مطار بغداد الدولي، تاسست منذ تاسيس المطار. وتعمل على الرصد السطحي وذلك بنقل الحاله السائده على ارض المطار كل ساعه الى قسم التنبؤ الجوي وقسم الرقابه الجويه في المطار.\n\nالسكان\nتُعتبر بغداد في الوقت الحاضر اكبر مدن العراق، حيث يسكن محافظه بغداد قرابه 7.2 مليون نسمه. فيما بلغ عدد سكان المحافظه عام 2009 قرابه 6.7 مليون نسمه. كما تُعتبر ثاني كبريات العواصم العربيه من حيث حجمها السكاني. ويتكون معظم سكان مدينه بغداد من العرب المسلمين والاكراد الفيليين واقليات من المسيحيين والصابئه واليزيديين، فيما كان اليهود قبل عام 1948م، يشكلون نسبه كبيره من السكان وكانوا اكبر طائفه غير مسلمه لكن عددهم تناقص بشكل حاد بعد اعلان نشوء دوله اسرائيل على ارض فلسطين وهجرتهم الجماعيه نهايه الاربعينيات وبدايه الخمسينيات.\nلقد قفزت نسبه سكان بغداد الى مجموع سكان عموم العراق بشكل كبير جداً في خلال بضعه عقود من الزمن. كما انعكست تلك الزياده الكبيره في عدد السكان في اكتظاظ سكاني خانق في العديد من مناطق بغداد السكنيه وعلى الخصوص في مركز مدينه بغداد. وقد تجاوزت الكثافه السكانيه لمدينه الثوره (مدينه الصدر) اعلى معدلات الكثافه السكانيه المسجله في المنطقه. تزامنت تلك الظاهره السريعه مع فتره اضطرابات غير مسبوقه في تاريخ العراق الحديث، فقد تفجرت ازمه سكن حاده في بغداد، وبدات تظهر اختناقات مروريه، وعجز واسع النطاق في الخدمات الاساسيه لحياه المواطنين البغداديين كالنقص في تجهيز مياه الشرب والنقص في تجهيزات الطاقه وخدمات الاتصالات.\nالجدول الاتي يظهر عدد سكان مدينه بغداد التقريبي من عام 1800 وحتى 2010:\n\nالاقتصاد\nمن الناحيه الاقتصاديه، تُعد بغداد مركزًا للعديد من المصانع والورش، والمركز الرئيسي للصناعه في العراق كما تعد مركزًا تجاريًّا رئيسيًّا وحلقه وصل بين تركيا وسوريا والهند وجنوب شرق اسيا والسوق التجاري الرئيسي في الدوله وايضًا تعد مركزاً سياحياً هاماً يزوره اكثر من مليون سائح في السنه قبل الحصار حيث كان المطار الدولي يعمل وتُعد ايضًا بغداد من المناطق الزراعيه حيث ان كثيرا من توابعها يعتمد على زراعه كثير من الغلات.\n\nالصناعه\nيُعد كل من السجاد والجلود والمنسوجات ومنتجات الاسمنت والتبغ، اهم المنتجات في بغداد. كما يُعتبر انتاج وتكرير النفط ايضًا احد اهم الانشطه الاقتصاديه في المدينه. حيث ثبت ان حقل نفط شرق بغداد يحمل احد اكبر الاحتياطيات في العراق (18 بليون برميل). وتُعتبر مصفاه الدوره التي تقع على مشارف المدينه هي ثالث اكبر مصفاه في العراق من حيث القدره على الانتاج (100,000 برميل باليوم الواحد). يُشار بالذكر الى ان بغداد تحتضن سنويًّا معرضًا عالميًا لمختلف الصناعات حول العالم، هو معرض بغداد الدولي.\n\nالزراعه\nتنتشر في المدينه بساتين النخيل، وتتركز بكثافه على ضفاف نهر دجله. وتُعتبر الوثائق العثمانيه وخصوصا سندات الطابو واحده من اهم المصادر التاريخيه التي توثق ذلك، لما لها من اهميه بعد اصدار الدوله العثمانيه لقانون الاراضي عام 1859. حيث تشير هذه الوثائق الى ان بساتين النخيل كانت تاريخيا موجوده على ضفتي نهر دجله، بالاضافه لوجود بساتين اخرى تحوي اشجار مثمره كالحمضيات، كما تنتج هذه الاراضي محاصيلا وفيره.\n\nالتجاره\nكان من نتيجه وقوع بغداد تاريخيًا على مسار طريق الحرير العالمي، وفي وسط العراق حديثًا، ان اصبح موقعها يتحكم بالاقتصاد الوطني بشكل كبير. ولقد لعبت الاسواق التجاريه في المدينه منذ القدم دورا مهما محوريا في الحركه التجاريه والاقتصاديه. وتشهد اسواق المدينه نشاطا كبيرًا على مدار العام وتعرض فيها سلع ومنتجات محليه او مستورده من مناشئ مختلفه.\nوتختلف هذه الاسواق من حيث التراث والحداثه او حسب نوعيه السلع التي تتعامل فيها، فمنها ما يُعتبر من الاسواق التراثيه، كسوق الصفافير وسوق السراي، وسوق الساعاتيه، وسوق الاسترابادي، وسوق المستنصر، وسوق دانيال، ومنها ما هو اسواق للجمله، ويتركز هذا النوع في سوقين رئيسيين هما سوق جميله، وسوق الشورجه. بالاضافه الى الخانات القديمه. كما تحوي المدينه على الكثير من الاسواق الجديده كالسوق العربي، وسوق الارمن، وسوق الكنيسه، والسوق العباسي. هذا بالاضافه الى المجمعات التجاريه الحديثه، حيث ظهرت في السبعينيات والثمانينات من القرن العشرين الاسواق المركزيه في عدد من المناطق البغداديه. اما اليوم فيوجد عدد من مراكز التسوق الكبيره نسبيًا في بعض الاماكن التجاريه من العاصمه.\n\nبغداد الرسميه\nتحوي المدينه على مراكز الحكم الرئيسيه في البلاد، بالاضافه الى الوزارت والسفارات الاجنبيه ومقرات المنظمات الدوليه العامله في العراق. كما توجد في بغداد اهم القصور الرئاسيه التي يعود تاريخها الى فترات مختلفه، منها القصر الجمهوري، وقصر الفاو، قصر الرحاب، قصر الزهور، وقصر السلام. وتُعد منطقه كراده مريم (المنطقه الخضراء بعد 2003) اهم المناطق التي تقع فيها هذه المؤسسات الاداريه.\n\nامانه بغداد\nيعود تاريخ تاسيس امانه بغداد الى زمن الدوله العثمانيه في عهد الوالي مدحت باشا عام 1868، حيث كانت بمستوى بلديه. وجاءت تسميه امانه العاصمه وتسميه رئيسها بـ «امين العاصمه» بعد صدور قانون اداره البلديه عام 1931. وبموجبه تم الغاء قانون البلديات العثماني السابق وجميع الانظمه والتعليمات الصادره بموجبه. لقد كان ارتباط امانه العاصمه بوزاره الداخليه حتى قيام ثوره 14 تموز عام 1958. في عام 1987، تم تغيير تسميه «امانه العاصمه» الى «امانه بغداد»، كذلك تم الغاء محافظه بغداد وجعلها مدينه بغداد بعد ان تم تعديل ارتباط الوحدات الاداريه التابعه لها ووضعت حدود جديده لمدينه بغداد واُعيد ارتباط الامانه بمجلس الوزراء وهو الحال القائم حاليًا. الا ان اعاده المحافظه قد تم في وقت لاحق.\n\nالبنيه التحتيه\nتتكون بغداد من شبكه من الخطوط السريعه والطرق الرئيسيه والثانويه تغطي جميع انحاء المدينه. وترتبط بمطار بغداد الدولي عبر طريق سريع يمتد الى الجهه الغربيه منها. كما ترتبط بمدن العراق الاخرى وبمدن الجوار عبر عدد من الطرق السريعه، اهمها طريق المرور السريع 1 الذي يربط عدد من الدول العربيه مرورًا ببغداد، فضلاً عن الطريق الاستراتيجي الممتد من مدينه زاخو في الشمال الى محافظه البصره مروراً ببغداد. وتُعد الطرق التاليه من اهم واشهر الشوارع الرئيسيه الداخليه في المدينه: 14 رمضان، وابو نؤاس، والمتنبي، والمغرب، والاميرات، والرشيد، والفضل، والنضال، وحيفا، وعمر بن عبد العزيز، وفلسطين، وغيرها. كما يمر بالمدينه عدد من السكك الحديديه التي تربط شمال العراق بجنوبه، فهناك خط سكك حديد بغداد – الموصل، وخط سكك حديد بغداد – البصره.\nوقد تاثرت البنيه التحتيه في بغداد اسوهً بباقي مدن وقرى العراق، بشكل كبير نتيجه للحروب التي خاضتها البلاد في العقود الاخيره، والحصار الاقتصادي الذي فُرض عليه لمده 13 عام. ثم تلى ذلك الغزو الامريكي للعراق في عام 2003، والاداره السيئه للموارد بعده، واللذان اثرا سلبا بشكل كبير على ما تبقى من بنيه تحتيه.\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nازداد الازدحام في مدينه بغداد، ولا سيما بعد الاحتلال الامريكي سنه 2003، حين تكاثر استيراد السيارات، قال عضو مجلس النواب، جاسمُ البخاتي، في يوم 16 اذار سنه 2021 «ان طرق بغداد مصممه لاستيعاب 700 الف سياره، بينما يتجول فيها الان ما بين 2.5 و 3 ملايين سياره»، تُعتبر الحافلات والمركبات الصغيره الوسائل الرئيسيه للتنقل داخل مدينه بغداد. ويوجد من هذه الحافلات ما هو عام تابع للمنشاه العامه للنقل، ومنها ماهو خاص. اما بالنسبه للمركبات فتُستخدم سيارات الاجره والسيارات الخاصه.\nكما يُعد النقل النهري عبر نهر دجله من الوسائل الشائعه ايضًا لدى البغداديين، حيث تختصر القوارب الكثير من الوقت والمسافات، خاصه بعد الوضع الامني السيئ الذي تلى الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003، والذي نتج عنه اغلاق عدد كبير من الطرق والجسور الرئيسيه في المدينه، ووضع نقاط تفتيش وجدارن كونكريتيه حالت دون وصول المواطنين الى العديد من الاماكن عبر المركبات بصوره طبيعيه، وادت الى اختناقات مروريه كبيره. ويُسمح لهذه القوارب التنقل بين عدد قليل من جسور بغداد البالغ عددها 13 جسرًا.\nوكان من المفترض انشاء مشروع مترو في المدينه منذ عده عقود، كما كانت هناك خطط لبناء هذا النظام. وقد بُنيَ فعلا جزء من الانفاق، ولكنها استخدمت لاغراض عسكريه. بدات الحكومه العراقيه في تشرين الثاني / نوفمبر 2008 بدراسات الجدوى لبناء خطين تحت الارض في كل من بغداد والنجف جنوب البلاد، الا ان المشروع لم يرَ النور الى الان.\n\nسكك الحديد\n\nشهد العراق اول خط حديدي لعربات الترام عام 1869، عندما اسس الوالي العثماني مدحت باشا شركه ترامواي بغداد - الكاظميه، حيث استخدمت الخيول لجر العربات، وكان يعرف لدى العراقيون ب «الكاري». وقد تشكلت اول اداره للسكك الحديد في العراق في عام 1916، وكانت انذاك تحت سيطره الجيش البريطاني. ثم انتقلت الى اداره مدنيه بريطانيه عام 1920، ثم تحولت الى اداره مدنيه عراقيه في 1936. وقد تم تسيير اول رحله من بغداد الى سميكه الدجيل الواقعه الى الجنوب من مدينه سامراء عام 1914.\nتقوم الشركه العامه لسكك الحديد حاليا بتسيير رحلات للقطار بين بغداد والبصره، حيث سُير اول قطار بينهما عام 1920. في حين انه قد تم تسيير اول قطار بين بغداد وكركوك عام 1925، واول قطار بين بغداد والموصل عام 1940، واول قطار من العراق الى محطه حيدر باشا في اسطنبول في 15 تموز عام 1940. وقد تم تشغيل اول قطار على الخط القياسي في العراق بين بغداد والبصره عام 1967.\nتضرر قطاع سكك الحديد في العراق بفعل الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003 وما اعقبه من عمليات نهب، حيث لم يعد صالحًا للاستخدام من القاطرات سوى عدد قليل. كما ان الوضع الامني غير المستقر ادى الى توقف الرحلات بشكل نهائي في فترات معينه.\n\nالعماره والتخطيط الحضري\nتميز النمط المعماري البغدادي بتناغم متناسق بين الناحيه الوظيفيه والناحيه الجماليه. وقد راعى المعمار العراقي عند تشييد الدار البغدادي الظروف المناخيه واحياءها ومحلاتها، وجعل النوافذ المطله على الخارج قليله الفتحات ومقاربه لنوافذ الجانب الاخر من الدور، وجعل الفسحات المكشوفه متجهه لوسط الدار ليوفر بذلك جوًا مظللاً منورًا قد الامكان مراعيًا الظروف الاجتماعيه السائده حينذاك. وقد اكثر المعمار البغدادي من استخدام الخشب للحد من تقلبات درجه الحراره في داخل الدار.\nكان الطابوق ولا يزال يُعتبر الماده الاساسيه في بناء العماره البغداديه لعدم توفر الحجر كما في بلاد الشام، كما استخدام الاجر في صياغه انواع من العقود المستديره والمدببه والتي كونت مع الطابوق مقرنصات جمعت بين الوظيفه الانشائيه وجماليه التشكيل. اما الاسقف التي اُقيمت على الاعمده فكانت مادتها الاساسيه الخشب.\nمن الجدير بالذكر ان بغداد شهدت في نهايه العشرينات من القرن العشرين نمطًا انتقاليًا بين النمط البغدادي القديم والنمط الذي ساد فيما بعد، والمتمثل بتشييد «محله السنك»، والتي استخدم في تشييدها نمط جديد تمثل في استخدام حديد الشيلمان في تسقيف الدور والمحلات العامه والخانات للاغراض التجاريه، كما ظهرت سينما الرشيد والحمراء وعلاء الدين.\nتمتاز ازقه بغداد واماكنها السكنيه القديمه كشارع الرشيد بعناصر معماريه مميزه، اهمها الشناشيل (المشربيات)، التي كانت ابرز معالمها. وتكتسب الشناشيل، او النوافذ الخشبيه المحفوره او المزخرفه، اهميه اجتماعيه لدى البغداديين، من حيث ضمان الخصوصيه في المنزل، فضلاً عن تخفيفها حده اشعه الشمس وتلطيف الهواء، كما ان بعضها مغطى بالزجاج اتقاءاً لبروده الشتاء. كما تنتشر البيوت التراثيه القديمه على مساحه وسعه من العاصمه، كما في شارع الكفاح وشارع الشيخ عمر والخلفاء والبتاويين والكاظميه والاعظميه والشواكه والكريمات.\n\nعماره الحداثه\nمرّت مدينه بغداد بتغيرات وتطورت مختلفه، اثرت على طابعها العمراني بشكل ملحوظ. وغير ذلك من نسيجها الحضري. وكان من ابرز التغيرات في عمارتها تلك الفتره التي تميزت ببزوغ وانتشار عماره الحداثه. فهي تمثل القتره بين الاربعينيات والسبعينيات من القرن العشرين والتي كان لها اسبابها العديده وعواملها المختلفه التي مهدت لانتشار عماره الحداثه. وقد تاسس في بغداد عام 1950 مجلس الاعمار العراقي، الذي نفذ وخطط للعديد من المشاريع الحيويه التي ما زالت قائمه وفعاله الى اليوم.\nشهدت حقبه الخمسينات وما بعدها نموًا واسعًا لفكر الحداثه في المجال المعماري. وقد برزت اسماء بغداديه كبيره في فن العماره والنحت مثل رفعت الجادرجي، محمد صالح مكيه، جواد سليم، خالد الرحال، محمد غني حكمت، زها حديد، وغيرهم. كما تمّت دعوه معماريين عالميين كبار لتصميم ابنيه في بغداد، ومن هؤلاء المعماريين جيو بونتي وفرانك لويد رايت والفار التو ووليم دودوك، ووالتر غروبيوس الذي صمّم ابنيه جامعه بغداد، بالاضافه الى فيرني مارج الذي صمّم المتحف العراقي الوطني، والذي جمع في تصميمه ثقافه بلاد الرافدين مع بناء حديث. غير ان العديد من هذه المشاريع تاجل تنفيذها لعقود او انها لم تُنفذ بتاتًا، كما هو الحال مع مشروع المدينه الاولمبيه الذي دعي لتصميمه المعماري لي كوربوزيه في العام 1956. ومن هذه المدينه لم يتم تنفيذ سوى قاعه الالعاب الرياضيه خلال الثمانينات وذلك باشراف احدى المؤسسات الفرنسيه وبتطابق تام مع التصميم الاصلي.\n\nالنسيج الحضري\nشهدت مدينه بغداد مراحل متعدده في نموها وتطورها كانت استجابه للمتغيرات العمرانيه والتخطيطيه والاقتصاديه والاجتماعيه والسياسيه، مما انعكس على نسيجها واستعمالات الارض فيها. وقد اتسمت بغداد في عشرينيات القرن العشرين بالنسيج المتضام العفوي والتدرج الهرمي للشوارع والازقه التي تنتهي بطرق غير نافذه، وكانت استعمالات الارض متداخله فيما بينها، وكان الطابع السكني هو الغالب على المدينه مع وجود المناطق التجاريه في المركز. وقد تحولت المدينه في الفتره الممتده من الثلاثينات وحتى نهايه الخمسينيات من النمو شبه الدائري الى الامتداد الطولي على محور نهر دجله، كما بدا النظام الشبكي للشوارع بالظهور.\nلقد وصلت مدينه بغداد الى مرحله النضج العمراني والتخطيطي في الفتره الممتده من الستينات وحتى اواخر السبعينات. وتوسعت المدينه بنمطين، الاول طولي على امتداد الطرق لرئيسيه، والثاني حول نوى وظيفيه ومعماريه كالاسواق والجوامع او تقاطعات الطرق.\nلقد تم وضع اول مخطط هيكلي لمدينه بغداد في عام 1956، وهو «مخطط مينوبريو، سبنسمي وماكفارليف» من المملكه المتحده، حيث يتالف من شبكه للطرق الرئسيه ومبان عامه جديده وتصاميم معماريه للمراكز الحكوميه مع تخصيص منطقه صناعيه جنوب بغداد. ولكن المخطط لم يُنفذ، حيث لم يتثمر نهر دجله، ولم تدرس فيه بدقه واقع المجتمع البغدادي واهميه الحفاظ على تراثه. لذا تم العمل على مخطط اخر هو «مخطط دوكسيادس» من اليونان في عام 1959. حيث كان مستطيلا مكون من شبكه تخطيطيه.\nومع حلول السبعينيات، ظهرت فكره تطوير «منطقه بغداد الكبرى»، وذلك عندما اوصى التصميم الانمائي الشامل لعام 1973 بان يتم اعداد تصميم العاصمه الاساسي في اطار خطه التنميه القوميه، وان فائض عدد سكان العاصمه على قابليه الاستيعاب المقرره المتاتي من الهجره ومن الزياده الطبيعيه لنمو السكان يتوجب توطينهم في منطقه بغداد الكبرى التي حددها التصميم الانمائى الشامل بدائره نصف قطرها يتراوح ما بين 50 - 55 كم من مركز بغداد، وهذه الدائره ايضًا تحاط بمنطقه دائره الاقليم المركزي ذو نصف القطر البالغ بما بمقداره من 100 - 120 كم من مركز العاصمه.\n\nدور العباده\nينتشر في مدينه بغداد الاف المساجد والحسينيات للمذاهب الاسلاميه المختلفه، كثير منها تم تصميمه على عماره اسلاميه. وتحوي المدينه على الكثير من المساجد الاثريه من العهد العباسي وحتى العثماني مثل جامع الخلفاء من عام 908، وجامع مرجان من عام 1356، وجامع سيد سلطان علي من عام 1589، جامع حسين باشا من عام 1674، وجامع العادليه من عام 1749، وجامع الحيدرخانه من عام 1819، وجامع الازبك من عام 1879، وجامع الشيخ معروف الكرخي من عام 1892. كما يوجد في المدينه عدد من المساجد الكبرى والمراقد التي لها اهميه تاريخيه، مثل مسجد الامام الاعظم (مرقد الامام ابو حنيفه النعمان) المؤسس عام 985، ومسجد الحضره الكاظميه (مرقد الامام موسى الكاظم) المؤسس عام 947. وجامع الشيخ عبد القادر الكيلاني في الحضره القادريه منذ عام 1534م.\nلقد ازدادت مساجد المدينه بشكل ملحوظ بعد الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003. وكانت من بين مظاهر الفوضى التي خلفتها الحرب، الانتشار العشوائي للجوامع والمساجد التي بنيت بالتجاوز على اراض مملوكه للغير او حوٌلت مبان حكوميه متروكه الى مساجد دون الحصول على الموافقات الرسميه اللازمه.\nتنتشر في المدينه عشرات الكنائس للطوائف المسيحيه المختلفه في مختلف انحائها، حيث تواجدت الطائفه المسيحيه في بغداد منذ انشائها في العصر العباسي. بل يُرجع بعض المؤرخون تواجد المسيحيه في موقع مدينه بغداد الحالي الى ما قبل انشاء مدينه بغداد على يد الخليفه ابو جعفر المنصور، حيث اشار بعض المؤرخون الى وجود اديره مسيحيه قديمه في اطراف موقع بغداد الحالي. وتضم بغداد على اكبر تجمع مسيحي في العراق، ويتالف المسيحيون في بغداد من عده طوائف غالبيتهم من الكلدان والسريان الكاثوليك لكن يوجد تجمع كبير للكنائس الاشوريه المشرقيه والسريانيه الارثوذكسيه مع تواجد اكبر تجمع بروتستانتي في العراق في بغداد.\nتضم بغداد بالاضافه لعدد من دور العباده التابعه للصابئه المندائيين. ويوجد في المدينه ايضًا كنيس يهودي في منطقه البتاوين، لكنه مهجور بسبب تهجير يهود العراق الى فلسطين في نهايه الاربعينيات وبدايه الخمسينيات من القرن العشرين. يُشار بالذكر الى ان اعمال العنف الذي شهدته البلاد وهجره المسيحيين بكثره مؤخرًا، اديّا الى اغلاق كثير من الكنائس في بغداد.\n\nمعالم بغداد\nالتعليم والتعليم العالي\nتاسست في بغداد منذ انشائها في القرن الثامن، عده مدارس تاريخيه كان لها دور كبير في الحضاره الاسلاميه، منها المدرسه المامونيه، المدرسه المستنصريه، المدرسه الموفقيه، المدرسه النظاميه، ومدرسه محمد امين السويدي. وتُعتبر بغداد تاريخيّا، المركز التعليمي الرئيس في العراق. كما كانت الحكومه العراقيه في الفتره المعاصره هي المسؤوله عن هذا القطاع لفتره طويله.\n\nلقد عانى قطاع التعليم والتعليم العالي في بغداد ابتداءً من حرب الخليج الاولى (1980 - 1988)، وحتى الغزو الامريكي للعراق في عام 2003، الذي استمرت تبعاته الى اليوم، حيث تعرضت الكثير من المنشات التعليميه للقصف او التفجيرات طيله العقود القليله الماضيه. وقد تدهور التعليم في العراق بشكل عام في الفتره الاخيره، مما ادى لظهور التعليم الخاص بموازاه التعليم الحكومي، بالاضافه لزياده كبيره في نسبه الاميه نتيجه للتهرب من المدارس.\nالتعليم الاساسي والاعدادي\nشهدت الفتره المتاخره من العهد العثماني في بغداد نهضه تعليميه. فقد انشا الوالي مدحت باشا اول مدارس بغداد المعاصره، وهي المدرسه الرشديه العسكريه سنه 1869، التي تخرج منها ضباطا عراقيين بعد دراسه 4 سنوات. كما تاسست اول مدارس المدينه الاعداديه عام 1888، وهي الاعداديه المركزيه، وكانت الثانويه الوحيده في المدينه. وتُعد اول مؤسسه علميه وثقافيه معاصره في بغداد وارتبط اسمها بتاريخ المدينه وذاكرتها الثقافيه. اما في عام 1889، فقد تم تاسيس اول مدرسه ابتدائيه حكوميه في المدينه ايام الوالي سري باشا، وقد تبرع ببنائها العلامه عبد الوهاب النائب، واُطلق عليها اسم «حميديه مكتبي». ويوجد في المدينه اليوم عدد كبير من المدارس، بعضها مخصص للطلبه الموهوبين مثل ثانويه المتميزين، وكليه بغداد.\nالتعليم العالي\nبالنسبه للتعليم الجامعي، فتحوي المدينه على خمسه جامعات رئيسيه. وقد تاسست اول جامعه في المدينه عام 1957، وهي جامعه بغداد، والتي تاسست كمدرسه للحقوق في بادئ الامر عام 1908. ثم تلاها الجامعات الاخرى، وهي الجامعه المستنصريه، والجامعه التكنولوجيه، وجامعه النهرين والجامعه العراقيه تاسست العديد من الكليات الاهليه والتي تكون تحت اشراف وزاره التعليم العالي والبحث العلمي، مثل كليه المنصور الجامعه، وكليه بغداد للصيدله، وغيرها العديد من الكليات والمعاهد.\n\nالثقافه\nاشتهرت بغداد منذ العصر العباسي بالشعراء والادباء والكتاب المعروفين، حيث ان الحراك الثقافي بدا يُبرز المدينه كواحده من اكثر العواصم العربيه تاثيراً في الثقافه والفنون. ويُعقد في بغداد سنويّا العديد من المهرجانات الثقافيه كمهرجان بغداد السينمائي الدولي. وتحوي المدينه على عدد كبير من الصروح الثقافيه الهامه كالمسرح الوطني العراقي، المتحف العراقي، ومكتبه بيت الحكمه. بالاضافه الى عدد من المقاهي الثقافيه الشهيره ودور العرض القديمه التي تقع في شارع الرشيد وشارع المتنبي، وغيرها. كما تزخر بغداد اليوم بالعديد من الاسماء الكبيره في مجالات الفن والادب والرسم والسينما وغيرهم الكثير من الفنانين.\nوكان الفن البغدادي الحديث قد انجب في مطلع الخمسينيات من القرن العشرين مجموعه اعمال ابداعيه كبيره ذات سمات جماليه جديده تميزت بانتمائها الجذري لتاريخ العراق وارتباطها الصريح بتطوره، كما كان لظهور ثوره الشعر الحر في العراق انعكاسًا في ازدهار الوعي الاجتماعي والثقافي في هذه الفتره. وقد ادى هذا الى تاسيس جماعه بغداد للفن الحديث عام 1951 على يد عدد من رواد الفن العراقي كشاكر حسن ال سعيد وجواد سليم وغيرهم، كما انضم لها نخبه من التشكيليين والمعماريين والفنانين العراقيين فيما بعد.\nاصبحت الجماعه بعد ظهورها مركز اشعاع فكري للفنانين العراقيين في الستينات والسبعينات، كما اسهموا في وضع لبنات جديده الى صرح الفن العراقي الحديث المعاصر.\n\nمن جهه اخرى، تم تاسيس المتحف الوطني للفن الحديث (مركز صدام للفنون سابقًا) في بغداد في ثمانينيات القرن العشرين، والذي ضم نخبه من اللوحات الفنيه لرواد الحركه التشكيليه المعاصره في العراق، الا انه تعرض للسرقه والاهمال مؤخرًا.\nشهدت البنى التحتيه الثقافيه في بغداد واقعًا سيئًا بعد الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003، حيث يتجلى هذا الواقع بنحو خاص في الحال الراهن للمرافق الثقافيه. فقد تم اغلاق معظم المتاحف والمكتبات ودور العرض وقاعات الفن التشكيلي في المدينه. في ظل هذه الظروف السيئه، تعد بغداد واحده من المدن المبدعه في قائمه اليونيسكو للمدن الابداعيه في المجال الادبي منذ عام 2015م، وتم اختيار بغداد عاصمه للثقافه العربيه لعام 2013، وقد شهد هذا العام زخمًا ثقافيًا لم تعهده المدينه منذ عام 2003، حيث اُقيمت عدد من العروض الموسيقيه والمسرحيه من العراق وبعض الدول العربيه، بالاضافه لمعارض الكتاب والفنون التشكيليه وملتقيات شعريه وادبيه اخرى.\nالتراث والفلكلور\n\nتتميز بغداد بارث حضاري وتراث فني وموسيقي كبيرين، حيث يُعد المقام العراقي من الفنون الموسيقيه العربيه القديمه، ويعتبره البعض ارقى شكل من اشكال المقام. وتمتاز المدينه بمقام الجالغي البغدادي، والذي يقوم باداءه قارئ، بالاضافه الى عدد من العازفين على الات السنطور، الجوزه، والطبله او الدنبك واحياناً اله الرق. ويُعتبر الفنان محمد القبانجي من اهم مؤديي هذا الفن في القرن العشرين.\n\nيُعتبر المتحف البغدادي من اهم الصروح الثقافيه التي تؤرخ لتراث بغداد في التاريخ المعاصر. وقد عمدت امانه بغداد على انشاء هذا المتحف عام 1968 بالقرب من المدرسه المستنصريه ليضم غالبيه المعالم الحياتيه لسكان بغداد الاوائل، ويوثق بموضوعيه فتره زمنيه من تاريخ العاصمه. ويضم اليوم بعد التوسعه 385 تمثالاً توزعت على 77 مشهدا. كما قامت محافظه بغداد في عام 2011 باعاده تاهيل وافتتاح احد المباني التراثيه القديمه في شارع المتنبي كمركز ثقافي بغدادي، والذي يوفر مصادر تراثيه عبر مكتبه بغداد، وهي مكتبه تراثيه تعنى بتاريخ وتراث هذه المدينه.\nوقد تحدث الكثيرون من الكتاب والمؤرخين عن بغداد القديمه وتاسيسها وتسميتها، ووصفوا تراثها ومميزاته، حيث تميزت المدينه بحرف كثيره كصناعه النحاسيات (الصفر)، وتعد صناعه الصفر من اقدم الصناعات الشعبيه في بغداد والعراق، كما عُرف عن سوق الصفافير انه قبله السواح قبل عقود من الزمن، الا ان السوق في الوقت الحاضر يشهد انحسار كبير بسبب الحروب واعوام الحصار والوضع الامني المتدهور، وقطع اجزاء من شارع الرشيد وجعله ممرًا واحدًا.\nبغداد في الشعر والفن\nلبغداد مكانه كبيره في ذاكره الشعراء. وقد كُتب عنها الكثير وروي الاكثر، مثلما تركت على مستوى العماره والبناء والفعليه الحياتيه، مايستحق ان يقال عنه الكثير. ولقد تغنى الادباء ببغداد على طول امتداد عمرها منذ بناها الخليفه ابو جعفر المنصور. الابيات التاليه هي بعض ما عبّر به شعراء عرب في وصف بغداد:\n\nكذلك ورد ذكر المدينه في بعض الاغاني والقصص الفلكلوريَّه المحليَّه والعربيه، كما تغنى بها وبمجدها كبار المغنيين والمغنيات العراقيين والعرب، حيث غنت لها ام كلثوم ومحمد عبد الوهاب وفريد الاطرش وفيروز وكاظم الساهر، وغيرهم.\n\nالسياحه\nتمتاز بغداد بعده معالم سياحيه واثريه مثل المتاحف التي تعرض فيها الاثار المختلفه من جواهر وعملات وهياكل بشريه وتماثيل من عصور ما قبل التاريخ حتى القرن السابع عشر الميلادي. ومن شواهدها الابديه الاثار الاسلاميه التي تتمثل في بقايا سور بغداد ودار الخلافه والمدرسه المستنصريه التي فيها ساعه المدرسه المستنصريه العجيبه ومقر المعتصم ومسجده الشهير وتحتوي على مساجد تاريخيه عديده منها: جامع الخلفاء والذي كان يسمى جامع الخليفه، ومسجد الامام الاعظم ابو حنيفه في الاعظميه، وجامع الاحمديه والذي فيه مدرسه تاريخيه هي مدرسه الاحمديه، ومسجد الامام موسى الكاظم وفيه الحضره الكاظميه، وجامع مرجان في سوق الشورجه، وجامع المنصور وجامع المهدي وجامع الرصافه، بالاضافه لمدارس تاريخيه عريقه كالمدرسه الشرفيه بجوار قبر ابي حنيفه النعمان والمدرسه الموفقيه ومدرسه الاصفيه، والمدرسه القادريه، والمدرسه النظاميه. وتعاني المباني التراثيه لبغداد حاليا من الاهمال والتعدي عليها، خاصه بعد الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003.\nكما تحوي المدينه عدد من المناطق الترفيهيه، مثل مدينه العاب الرصافه، ومدينه العاب الكرخ، وجزيره بغداد السياحيه، متنزه الزوراء، وجزيره الاعراس، والخضراء، وغيرها. هذا بالاضافه الى عدد من النوادي الاجتماعيه مثل: نادي الصيد، نادي الفروسيه، نادي العلويه، ونادي الهنديه، ونادي المنصور .\n\nالرياضه\nيوجد في بغداد عدد من ملاعب كره القدم القديمه، وعدد من الصالات الرياضيه المُغلقه، التي صمم احداها المعمار العالمي لي كوربوزيه. وقد تم انشاء اول ملاعب المدينه في عام 1966، بعد ان وُضع حجر الاساس في عهد الزعيم عبد الكريم قاسم، حيث يتسع الملعب لخمسين الف متفرج. وهو اكبر ملاعب المدينه الى هذا اليوم. ومن الملاعب الاخرى في المدينه ملعب الجيش، ملعب الزوراء، وملعب القوه الجويه. كما تحوي كليه التربيه الرياضيه على عدد من المنشات الرياضيه الكبيره داخل حرم جامعه بغداد.\nيُشار بالذكر الى ان العمل جارِ على تنفيذ مدينه رياضيه في منطقه التاجي شمال بغداد، تبلغ مساحتها مايقارب 500 دونم، وتشمل الملعب الاولمبي الرئيسي الذي يتسع لستين الف متفرج، وثلاثه ملاعب للتدريب، اثنان منها في الجانبين الجنوبي والشمالي من الموقع سعه كل واحد منهما 500 متفرج والثالث يتسع لـ 5000 متفرج.\nلقد عانى القطاع الرياضي في العراق من الاهمال والعقوبات الدوليه بعد الحروب المتتاليه التي شهدتها البلاد، وخصوصا الغزو الامريكي للعراق. وقد كان للمنتخب العراقي لكره القدم اول مبارياته الدوليه على ارضه منذ 2003 مع نظيره الفلسطيني في مدينتيّ بغداد واربيل عام 2009، حيث شكل هذا الحدث، مؤشرًا هامًا لعوده الحياه الطبيعيه الى العراق.\n\nالصحه\nتاسس في بغداد عام 1973 احد اكبر الصروح الطبيه في منطقه الشرق الاوسط، وهو مدينه الطب، حيث تضم بين دفتيها خمسه مستشفيات كبرى، هي دار التمريض الخاص، والجراحات التخصصيه، وامراض الجهاز الهضمي والكبد، وبغداد التعليمي، وحمايه الاطفال. وجميعها في مجال الطوارئ تعتمد على طوارئ مستشفى بغداد التعليمي الذي يحتوي على قسم للطوارئ يضم اكبر قاعتين لطوارئ الباطنيه والجراحيه (عدا حمايه الاطفال) فضلا عن الاحالات من المستشفيات الاخرى واسعاف جرحى الانفجارات الذين يحتاجون الى استنفار الجهود وتوفير العلاج اللازم لاسيما تعويضهم بما يحتاجونه من الدم.\nالجدول التالي يظهر اهم المستشفيات الموجوده في بغداد:\n\nمشاكل\nالوضع الامني\n\nشهدت بغداد اسوهً بمعظم مدن العراق، تدهورًا امنيًا كبيرًا كان احد نتائج الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003، والذي لا تزال تعاني منه حتى اليوم. حيث عمِت المدينه مؤخرًا الفوضى والفتن الطائفيه وجرائم القتل المختلفه من تفجيرات انتحاريه وسيارت مفخخه على يد منظمات متشدده.\nالتلوث والعشوائيات\n\nتعاني مدينه بغداد في الوقت الحاضر من النمو السكاني والعمراني المتزايد لا سيما بعد سقوط الحكم البعثي وما شهدته من هجره كبيره سواء اكان من المناطق الريفيه ومن المحافظات الاخرى ومن خارج العراق.\nتُعد المركبات ابرز مسبّبات التلوث في بغداد، مع توقف تنفيذ شبكات الطرق السريعه في المدينه. كما تُعد المناطق الصناعيه المنتشره في المدينه وما تبعثه المصانع والمعامل المختلفه الى الجو من ملوثات من اهم المسببات كذلك. ويوجد في بغداد عدد كبير من الصناعات الملوثه للهواء داخل المدينه، بعضًا منها من الصناعات الكبرى التي يفترض ابعادها الى خارج حدود التصاميم الاساسيه مثل محطه توليد الكهرباء في الدوره ومحطه توليد كهرباء جنوب بغداد. هناك ايضًا سبب اخر لتلوث الهواء في بغداد، وهو العواصف الترابيه التي تهب في اغلب ايام الصيف بسبب عدم وجود مناطق الاحزمه الخضراء حول المدينه وافتقارها الى مناطق خضراء محيطه بالمناطق السكنيه، وكذلك انتشار المولدات الكهربائيه الصغيره باعداد كبيره.\nاما فيما يخص التلوث المائي، فقد عانى نهر دجله الذي يخترق المدينه في السنوات الاخيره من التلوث بشكل كبير. وقد اعلنت وزاره البيئه العراقيه عن ارتفاع نسبه التلوث في النهر بصوره كبيره عند دخول مياهه الى مدينه بغداد، حيث ان عشرات الاف اللترات بالثانيه من مياه الصرف غير الصحي ترمى في النهر.\nالازمات المروريه\n\nتشهد بغداد اختناقات مروريه كبيره بسبب غلق الكثير من الطرق الفرعيه والرئيسيه بكتل كونكريتيه مختلفه الاحجام والاغراض بعد الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003. ويُعزى وجود هذه الكتل الى الوضع الامني الراهن بالبلد ولحمايه الاسواق واماكن التجمعات من التفجيرات والاعمال المسلحه. كما تعود اسباب الازمات المروريه ايضاً الى قدم تصاميم شوارع المدينه، بالاضافه الى العدد الكبير من المركبات المُسجله مؤخراً، فهناك اكثر من مليون ونصف المليون سياره في المدينه وحدها. كما تؤدي المواكب الدينيه الى اغلاق تام لبعض شوارع المدينه لافساح المجال لمرور مئات الاف الزوار الى المراقد والمساجد الكبرى في المدينه.\nالخدمات\nشهد وضع الخدمات في بغداد تدهورًا كبيرًا بعد الحروب التي خاضها العراق في العقود الاخيره، وخصوصًا حرب الخليج الثانيه عام 1991، والغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003، وما تبعه من احداث ادت الى وصول حال الخدمات العامه الى مستويات متدنيه جداً. حيث احتلت بغداد المرتبه الاخيره عالميًا عام 2012، كاسوا مدينه للعيش في العالم بحسب مسح قامت به مجموعه «ميرسل» العالميه لاستشارات الموارد البشريه، التي يقع مقرها في نيويورك. حيث استند التقرير الى الاوضاع التي تعيشها بغداد، من حيث سوء الخدمات العامه، والاضطرابات السياسيه، والاختناقات بالحواجر الكونكريتيه وتراكم القمامه والمباني المهدمه، اضافه الى الانقطاع في التيار الكهربائي، ومشاكل شبكه الصرف الصحي البدائيه، حيث تعاني المدينه من فياضانات كبيره اثناء فصل الشتاء. وياتي هذا التصنيف ايضًا الى جانب تقرير اخر اطلقته منظمه اليونسكو عام 2012، تم بموجبه تصنيف بغداد بالمرتبه الثالثه كاوسخ مدن العالم، وثامن عاصمه على مستوى التلوث البيئي.\n\nمدن شقيقه\nالمدن الشقيقه لبغداد هي:\n\n اذربيجان - باكو \n الاردن - عمّان \n سوريا - دمشق\n لبنان - بيروت

          "title": "Abbasid Palace",
          "content": "The Abbasid Palace (Arabic: القصر العباسي, romanized: Al-Qasr al-Abbasi) is an ancient Abbasid complex and an Iraqi historical palace located near the Tigris river on al-Rusafa side of Baghdad, Iraq. North of al-Mutanabbi Street and a part of al-Maidan area. The palace dates back to the late 12th or early 13th century. It was most likely built by the Abbasid caliph al-Nasir (although this is disputed) and was used as a walkable and observant fort for the Caliph. The Abbasid Palace is one of the few remaining examples of Abbasid-era buildings in Baghdad along with al-Mustansiriyya Madrasa and others. After falling into ruin, it was heavily reconstructed during the 20th century.\nThe Abbasid Palace is considered one of the most important archaeological buildings in Baghdad due to its age and Islamic architecture. The area in which the palace is located in, as well as the palace itself, are a part of a tentative UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nBackground\nThe palace was said to be built under the reign of Abbasid Caliph al-Nasir and includes special examples of Islamic architecture and façade of that time. During the early 20th-century, the German archeologist Ernst Herzfeld would examine the complex for the first time. At the time, he referred to it as \"Iwan al-Qal'ah\" since the only remains of the complex are the large gate and the courtyard with vague inscriptions. Several excavation and restoration missions would then materialize over the complex between 1933 and 1970. But the palace was left mostly untouched until 1980 under the leadership of former president Saddam Hussein when the palace was restored to its current form and also served as the headquarters for the former Iraqi House of Culture and Arts.\n\nDebate on the building's origins\nDuring the many episodes of archeology, restoration, and excavations, many discoveries were made such as the northern side of the courtyard is occupied by a structure that is topped by six domes suggesting Ottoman-like features. But no epigraphic evidence was found to suggest this was a caliph's palace or to back up its origins in general.\nDue to this, researchers and historians studying the complex gave it many names according to their opinions and research. It was first called Iwan al-Qal'ah or the Palace of the Castle. They also debated on which of the Abbasid palaces this one was if it was one. Some historians, including Iraqi historians Mustafa Jawad and Ya'qub Sarkis, supported the idea that it was the palace of caliph al-Nasir, relying on historical and schematic evidence, including what Andalusian traveler Ibn Jubayr mentioned on his trip to Baghdad where he reported seeing Caliph al-Nasir as he descended with his boat to his palace at the top of the eastern side on the Tigris River's shore. This matches with the location of the palace as it is at the top of the eastern side along with the old wall of Baghdad that still has its foundations remaining in the wall of the palace. Al-Nasir demolished the walls and built this palace in its place between 1180 and 1184. The architecture of the complex is also an important factor as it mirrors the architecture of another Abbasid structure, al-Mustansiriyya Madrasa. Factors such as the gate, the iwans, and the structure suggest it dates back to the Abbasid Caliphate. Traditionally, its considered a place where the caliph would meet dignitaries and visitors.\nAlthough it was also argued that the palace may belong to Caliph al-Mustansir or that the building was a madrasa called \"al-Sharabiyya Madrasa\" instead of an Abbasid caliph's palace. Many scholars have rejected the idea that this complex was intended to be a palace. Suggesting that it was the Sharabiyya Madrasa, or at the very least a madrasa, instead due to its architectural similarities to the Mustansiriyya Madrasa. Mainly, the architecture and the two levels contain side rooms that are large enough to be classrooms and house students. Despite arguments that the complex was allegedly a madrasa, there is also evidence that challenges this perspective. The historical sources suggest that the complex's location was home to the old Baghdad citadel and historically has been an administration center. Furthermore, historical sources have been silent on the alleged madrasa and that medieval complexes often share typological features. Therefore, it has been agreed that the complex may have been at least an Abbasid palace.\n\nRecent history\nBy the early 20th century the building was partly ruined. Significant parts of it were reconstructed between (approximately) 1933 and 1971 by the Iraqi Directorate of Antiquities. Excavations were also carried out during this period to uncover missing parts of the building. The exterior main entrance on the southwestern side of the building is a product of this reconstruction, while the vestibule to which it leads has been well preserved. In the courtyard, the main iwan was restored while some of the arcaded façades around it and two other sides of the courtyard were rebuilt.\nIn May 2018, a ceremony was held inside the Abbasid Palace that included poetry readings accompanied by playing the oud, followed by the playing of Sufi compositions by a band, maqam songs from the Iraqi heritage, a plastic art exhibition and a folklore bazaar that included accessories, handmade carpets and handicrafts. The event saw a crowded and diverse audience and also the supervision of the Director General of the Department of Public Cultural Relations, Falah Hassan Shaker. This event also gave two main messages. The first is sending a message to the world that Iraqis are proud of their heritage and civilization, with everyone participating in reviving the occasion, and the other message was aimed towards the Iraqi government with the need to pay attention to Iraqi archaeological sites and heritage buildings. The supervisor of the Baghdad file, the City of Literary Creativity, Dr. Sadiq Rahma, praised the event, saying, “The Abbasid Palace is a new creative space in which we can hold future activities, and the activity of the Department of Cultural Relations today is one of the best cultural activities, especially after its rehabilitation, which was completely neglected.”\nIn May 2024, a wedding took place in the Abbasid Palace. The wedding included 50 guests and a band that played traditional Iraqi music. Areej Fadhil chose this location for her wedding due to her love for the complex and was inspired by other couples around the world who had their weddings at heritage locations. Despite this, the decision to open the palace to such events by authorities ignited debates across Iraq about the misuse of heritage sites and the history of such sites, including recent neglect and looting of heritage landmarks.\n\nArchitecture\nGate\nThe gate of the complex is located on the western side of the building which faces the Tigris River and leads to the rectangular courtyard. The gate to the palace consists of an altar with a roof decorated with carvings and benches designated for guards and servants. It is the entrance to the palace and the altar to the side of the grand palace. It is more than 21 meters long and is surrounded by two niches in the form of a large, full circle, and is engraved with Qur’anic verses. It is recognized as one of the largest heritage Abbasid arches in Baghdad in the ornate Islamic architectural style.\n\nLayout and features\nThe palace is notable for its special architectural carving style in Islamic architecture which is similar to that of al-Mustansiriya Madrasa. Inside the complex is a rectangular courtyard with a large fountain in the middle, the courtyard is distinguished by brick decorations of different sizes and shapes. Surrounded by the courtyard are corridors and vestibules each of which is more than 26 meters long and more than nine meters high. The corridors contain muqarnas and open up to the courtyard through pointed arches.\nThe bricked arches and iwans of the palace include vaulted recesses and are filled with carved geometric decorations. Specifically the eastern corridor contains a vault that consists of a series of interlocked muqarnas that appear like a corbelled cell. The muqarnas appear through the iwans and end each in an eight-pointed star. Although vaulted muqarnas have already become a widespread feature of Islamic architecture by the 13th century, the muqarnas in the palace feature unique inscriptions and ornaments.\n\nEntering the palace, one can feel cold air surrounding them, this is because the building was designed to be cool in the summer and warm in the winter. The bricks of the building that were used for walls and ceilings were exposed to high temperatures so that they can be more durable and solid. Decorative bricks were exposed to medium and light temperatures so that the sculptor and engineer could make decorations and sculptures out of them. The walls of the building are thick which made the palace fortified and durable. The ground floor includes 18 rooms while the second floor contains 22. Among the rooms is an iwan, madrasa rooms, and a prayer mosque. Parts of the complex are also decorated with arabesque motifs which originated in Baghdad.Similar to the Mustansiriyya Madrasa, the center of the complex contains a courtyard shaped like a square. The eastern side is dominated by a massive iwan that leads to the gate that is undoubtedly the main gate to the entire complex. The massive keel-like shaped iwan is double-sized compared to the rest of the iwans that surround the courtyard and are arranged on two levels. Facing the massive iwan is a specious rectangular room which has been interpreted as a mosque area. Although the alleged mosque's room is flawed. Particularly, the room includes incorrect orientation to the Qibla by around 30 degrees. As well as lack of a mihrab and Qu'ranic inscriptions.\n\nSee also\nAbbasid architecture\nAl-Khulafa Mosque\nAl-Mustansiriyya Madrasa\n\nNotes\nReferences\nWorks cited\nAl-Janabi, Tariq Jawad (1975).

          "summary": "The Abbasid Palace (Arabic: القصر العباسي, romanized: Al-Qasr al-Abbasi) is an ancient Abbasid complex and an Iraqi historical palace located near the Tigris river on al-Rusafa side of Baghdad, Iraq. North of al-Mutanabbi Street and a part of al-Maidan area. The palace dates back to the late 12th or early 13th century. It was most likely built by the Abbasid caliph al-Nasir (although this is disputed) and was used as a walkable and observant fort for the Caliph. The Abbasid Palace is one of the few remaining examples of Abbasid-era buildings in Baghdad along with al-Mustansiriyya Madrasa and others. After falling into ruin, it was heavily reconstructed during the 20th century.\nThe Abbasid Palace is considered one of the most important archaeological buildings in Baghdad due to its age and Islamic architecture. The area in which the palace is located in, as well as the palace itself, are a part of a tentative UNESCO World Heritage Site.",

          "content": "Babylon ( BAB-il-on) was an ancient city located on the lower Euphrates river in southern Mesopotamia, within modern-day Hillah, Iraq, about 85 kilometres (53 miles) south of modern-day Baghdad. Babylon functioned as the main cultural and political centre of the Akkadian-speaking region of Babylonia. Its rulers established two important empires in antiquity, the 19th–16th century BC Old Babylonian Empire, and the 7th–6th century BC Neo-Babylonian Empire. Babylon was also used as a regional capital of other empires, such as the Achaemenid Empire. Babylon was one of the most important urban centres of the ancient Near East, until its decline during the Hellenistic period. Nearby ancient sites are Kish, Borsippa, Dilbat, and Kutha.\nThe earliest known mention of Babylon as a small town appears on a clay tablet from the reign of Shar-Kali-Sharri (2217–2193 BC), of the Akkadian Empire. Babylon was merely a religious and cultural centre at this point and was neither an independent state nor a large city. Instead, it was subject to the Akkadian Empire. After the collapse of the Akkadian Empire, the south Mesopotamian region was dominated by the Gutian Dynasty for a few decades, before the rise of the Third Dynasty of Ur, which encompassed the whole of Mesopotamia, including the town of Babylon.\nThe town became part of a small independent city-state with the rise of the first Babylonian Empire, now known as the Old Babylonian Empire, in the early second millennium BC. The Amorite king Hammurabi founded the short-lived Old Babylonian Empire in the 18th century BC. He built Babylon into a major city and declared himself its king. Southern Mesopotamia became known as Babylonia, and Babylon eclipsed Nippur as the region's holy city. The empire waned under Hammurabi's son Samsu-iluna, and Babylon spent long periods under Assyrian, Kassite and Elamite domination. After the Assyrians destroyed and then rebuilt it, Babylon became the capital of the short-lived Neo-Babylonian Empire, from 626 to 539 BC. Both the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and Walls of Babylon were ranked among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, with the former allegedly existing between approximately 600 BC and AD 1. However, there are questions about whether the Hanging Gardens of Babylon even existed, as there is no mention within any extant Babylonian texts of its existence. After the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the city came under the rule of the Achaemenid, Seleucid, Parthian, Roman, Sassanid, and Muslim empires. The last known habitation of the town dates from the 11th century, when it was referred to as the \"small village of Babel\".\nIt has been estimated that Babylon was the largest city in the world c. 1770 – c. 1670 BC, and again c. 612 – c. 320 BC. It was perhaps the first city to reach a population above 200,000. Estimates for the maximum extent of its area range from 890 (3½ sq. mi.) to 900 ha (2,200 acres). The main sources of information about Babylon—excavation of the site itself, references in cuneiform texts found elsewhere in Mesopotamia, references in the Bible, descriptions in other classical writing, especially by Herodotus, and second-hand descriptions, citing the work of Ctesias and Berossus—present an incomplete and sometimes contradictory picture of the ancient city, even at its peak in the sixth century BC. UNESCO inscribed Babylon as a World Heritage Site in 2019. The site receives thousands of visitors each year, almost all of whom are Iraqis. Construction is rapidly increasing, which has caused encroachments upon the ruins.\nBabylon stopped functioning as an urban centre between the 2nd century BC and the 7th century CE. Over those 700 years, it gradually declined from a major city to near-total abandonment. Small communities have continued to live in the area, and nearby towns such as Hillah remain inhabited on the historical site.\n\nNames\nThe spelling Babylon is the Latin representation of Koine Greek Babylṓn (Βαβυλών), derived from the native Akkadian: 𒆍𒀭𒊏𒆠, romanized: Bābilim, lit. 'gate of the god(s)'. The cuneiform spelling is KÁ.DIG̃IR.RAKI,  corresponding to the Sumerian phrase Kan dig̃irak.\nThe sign 𒆍 (KÁ) is the logogram for \"gate\", 𒀭 (DIG̃IR) means \"god\", and 𒊏 (RA) represents the coda of the word dig̃ir (-r) followed by the genitive suffix -ak. The final 𒆠 (KI) is a determinative indicating that the previous signs are to be understood as a place name.\nArchibald Sayce, writing in the 1870s, postulated that the Semitic name was a loan-translation of the original Sumerian name. However, the \"gate of god\" interpretation is increasingly viewed as a Semitic folk etymology to explain an unknown original non-Semitic placename. I. J. Gelb in 1955 argued that the original name was Babilla, of unknown meaning and origin, as there were other similarly named places in Sumer, and there are no other examples of Sumerian place-names being replaced with Akkadian translations. He deduced that it later transformed into Akkadian Bāb-ili(m), and that the Sumerian name Kan-dig̃irak was a loan translation of the Semitic folk etymology rather than the original name. The retranslation of the Semitic name into Sumerian would have taken place at the time of the \"Neo-Sumerian\" Third Dynasty of Ur. (Bab-Il).\n\nA fragmentary limestone votive inscription dated by paleography to the Early Dynastic II period (c. c. 2700 BC) was suggested to include the name of Babylon. It read \"en5-[si] BAR.KI.BAR dumu a-hu-ì-lum ̆lu-ì-lum-be-l[í] lú-ur-kù-bí dím é damar-utu mu-gub-am6\". Proposed as being in the Akkadian language though earlier than that language is attested, it refers to an unknown lord who was the governor (ENSI) of BAR.KI.BAR who constructed a temple for (possibly) Marduk, suggesting that the city might be Babylon. During the ED III period, sign placement was relatively fluid and so the KI sign could be seen as the determinative, with the name of the city as BAR.BAR, perhaps pronounced Babbar. Paul-Alain Beaulieu proposes that the original name could mean \"shining\" \"glowing\" or \"white\". It would be likely that it was later read as Babbir, and then Babbil by swapping the consonant r with l. The attribution to Marduk and to Babylon is considered doubtful.\nThe earliest reasonably firm mention of the city of Babylon comes from one of Shar-Kali-Sharri's year names, which reports the founding of temples of Annunitum and Ilaba in KÁ.DINGIRki, thought to be Babylon, indicating that the folk etymology was already widely known in the Akkadian Empire (c. 2334–2193 BC) period. However, the original form of the name (Babbar/Babbir) was not forgotten, as seen from the phonetic spelling ba-ab-bí-lum in the Ur III period, and the spellings Pambalu and Babalu in the Kassite period.\nAnother attested spelling for the city of Babylon is TIN.TIR.KI, attested sparsely in the Old Babylonian period, known mostly from later Neo-Babylonian copies, and was in widespread usage in the 1st Millennium BC. The spelling E.KI also appears in the 1st Millennium BC.\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the name appears as Babel (Hebrew: בָּבֶל, romanized: Bāḇel; Classical Syriac: ܒܒܠ, romanized: Bāḇēl, Imperial Aramaic: בבל Bāḇel; in Arabic: بَابِل Bābil), interpreted in Genesis 11:9 to mean \"confusion\", from the verb bilbél (בלבל, \"to confuse\"). The modern English verb, to babble (\"to speak foolish, excited, or confusing talk\"), is popularly thought to derive from this name but there is no direct connection.\nIn some instances, ancient records use \"Babylon\" as a name for other cities, including Borsippa within Babylon's sphere of influence, and Nineveh for a brief period after the Assyrian sack of Babylon.\n\nArchaeology\nThe site covers an area of about 1,000 hectares (3+3⁄4 sq mi), with about 450 hectares (1+3⁄4 sq mi) within the several kilometer (mile) long city walls, containing a number of mounds, the most prominent of which are Kasr, Merkes (13 meters; 43 ft above the plain), Homera, Ishin-Aswad, Sahn, Amran, and Babil. It is roughly bisected by the Shatt Al-Hillah, a branch of the Euphrates river, which has shifted slightly since ancient times. The local water table has risen, making excavation of lower levels difficult. Prior to the heavy use of baked bricks in the reign of Neo-Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 BC), construction at Babylon was primarily of unbaked brick, with the occasional use of baked bricks or bitumen.\n\nKasr – also called Palace or Castle, it was the location of the Neo-Babylonian ziggurat Etemenanki of Nebuchadnezzar II. It lies in the center of the site and rises to 19 meters (62 ft) above the plain.\nAmran Ibn Ali – about 22 meters (72 ft) high and at the south of the site. It is the site of Esagila, a temple of Marduk that also contained shrines to Ea and Nabu.\nHomera – a reddish-colored mound on the west side. Most of the Hellenistic remains are here. Most of the remains of the ziggurat Etemenanki were heaped here when it was demolished by Alexander the Great in 331 BC.\nBabil – a mound about 25 meters (82 ft) high at the northern end of the site. Its bricks have been subject to looting since ancient times. It held a palace built by Nebuchadnezzar.\nSubsequent excavation, looting, and reconstruction have reduced these original heights found by the German excavators.\n\nExcavations\nClaudius Rich, working for the British East India Company in Baghdad, excavated Babylon in 1811–12 and again in 1817. Captain Robert Mignan explored the site briefly in 1827. In 1829, he completed a map of Babylon which includes the location of several villages. William Loftus visited there in 1849. Austen Henry Layard made some soundings during a brief visit in 1850 before abandoning the site.\n\nFulgence Fresnel, Julius Oppert and Felix Thomas heavily excavated Babylon from 1852 to 1854. Much of their work was lost in the Qurnah Disaster, when a transport ship and four rafts sank on the Tigris river in May 1855. They had been carrying over 200 crates of artifacts from various excavation missions, when they were attacked by Tigris river pirates near Al-Qurnah. Recovery efforts, assisted by the Ottoman authorities and British Residence in Baghdad, loaded the equivalent of 80 crates on a ship for Le Havre in May 1856. Few antiquities from the Fresnel mission made it to France. Subsequent efforts to recover the lost antiquities from the Tigris, including a Japanese expedition in 1971–72, have been largely unsuccessful.\n\nHenry Rawlinson and George Smith worked there briefly in 1854. The next excavation was conducted by Hormuzd Rassam on behalf of the British Museum. Work began in 1879, continuing until 1882, and was prompted by widespread looting of the site. Using industrial scale digging in search of artifacts, Rassam recovered a large quantity of cuneiform tablets and other finds. The zealous excavation methods, common at the time, caused significant damage to the archaeological context. Many tablets had appeared on the market in 1876 before Rassam's excavation began.\n\nA team from the German Oriental Society led by Robert Koldewey conducted the first scientific archaeological excavations at Babylon. The work was conducted daily from 1899 until 1917. A major problem for Koldewey was the large scale mining of baked bricks, which began in the 19th century and which were mainly sourced from the time of Nebuchadnezzar II. At the time, excavations for brick mining, for various building projects, including the Hindiya dam were under way. The primary efforts of the dig involved the temple of Marduk and the processional way leading up to it, as well as the city wall.\nArtifacts, including pieces of the Ishtar Gate and hundreds of recovered tablets, were sent back to Germany, where Koldewey's colleague Walter Andrae reconstructed them into displays at the Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin. The Koldewey expedition recovered artifacts from the Old Babylonian period. These included 967 clay tablets, with 564 tablets from the Middle Babylonian period, stored in private houses, with Sumerian literature and lexical documents. The German archaeologists fled before oncoming British troops in 1917, and again, many objects went missing in the following years.\nFurther work by the German Archaeological Institute was conducted by Heinrich J. Lenzen in 1956 and Hansjörg Schmid in 1962, working the Hellenistic, Parthian, Sasanian, and Arabic levels of the site. Lenzen's work dealt primarily with the Hellenistic theatre, and Schmid focused on the temple ziggurat Etemenanki.\nA topographical survey at the site was conducted in 1974, followed in 1977 by a review of the stratigraphical position of the main monuments and reconsideration of ancient water levels, by the Turin Centre for Archaeological Research and Excavations in the Middle East and Asia, and the Iraqi-Italian Institute of Archaeological Sciences. The focus was on clearing up issues raised by re-examination of the old German data. Additional work in 1987–1989 concentrated on the area surrounding the Ishara and Ninurta temples in the Shu-Anna city-quarter of Babylon.\nA number of Iraqi excavations have occurred at Babylon, the earliest in 1938. From 1979 to 1981 excavation and restoration work was conducted at the Ninmah Temple, Istar Temple, and the Southern Palace. Occasional excavations and restorations continued in the 1970s and 1980s.\nDuring the restoration efforts in Babylon, the Iraqi State Organization for Antiquities and Heritage conducted extensive research, excavation and clearing, but wider publication of these archaeological activities has been limited. Most of the known tablets from all modern excavations remain unpublished.\n\nSources\nThe main sources of information about Babylon—excavation of the site itself, references in cuneiform texts found elsewhere in Mesopotamia, references in the Bible, descriptions in other classical writing, especially by Herodotus, and second-hand descriptions citing the work of Ctesias and Berossus—present an incomplete and sometimes contradictory picture of the ancient city, even at its peak in the sixth century BC. Babylon was described, perhaps even visited, by a number of classical historians including Ctesias, Herodotus, Quintus Curtius Rufus, Strabo, and Cleitarchus. These reports are of variable accuracy and some of the content was politically motivated, but these still provide useful information.\nHistorical knowledge of early Babylon must be pieced together from epigraphic remains found elsewhere, such as at Uruk, Nippur, Sippar, Mari, and Haradum.\n\nEarly references\nThe earliest known mention of Babylon as a small town appears on a clay tablet from the reign of Shar-Kali-Sharri (2217–2193 BC) of the Akkadian Empire. References to the city of Babylon can be found in Akkadian and Sumerian literature from the late third millennium BC. One of the earliest is a tablet describing the Akkadian king Šar-kali-šarri laying the foundations in Babylon of new temples for Annūnı̄tum and Ilaba. Babylon also appears in the administrative records of the Third Dynasty of Ur, which collected in-kind tax payments and appointed an ensi as local governor.\nThe so-called Weidner Chronicle (also known as ABC 19) states that Sargon of Akkad, c. 23rd century BC in the short chronology, had built Babylon \"in front of Akkad\" (ABC 19:51). A later chronicle states that Sargon \"dug up the dirt of the pit of Babylon, and made a counterpart of Babylon next to Akkad\". (ABC 20:18–19). Van de Mieroop has suggested that those sources may refer to the much later Assyrian king Sargon II of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, rather than Sargon of Akkad.\n\nClassical dating\nCtesias, quoted by Diodorus Siculus and in George Syncellus's Chronographia, claimed to have access to manuscripts from Babylonian archives, which date the founding of Babylon to 2286 BC, under the reign of its first king, Belus. A similar figure is found in the writings of Berossus, who, according to Pliny, stated that astronomical observations commenced at Babylon 490 years before the Greek era of Phoroneus, indicating 2243 BC. Stephanus of Byzantium wrote that Babylon was built 1002 years before the date given by Hellanicus of Lesbos for the siege of Troy (1229 BC), which would date Babylon's foundation to 2231 BC. All of these dates place Babylon's foundation in the 23rd century BC. However, cuneiform records have not been found to correspond with these classical, post-cuneiform accounts.\n\nHistory\nThe first attested mention of Babylon was in the late 3rd millennium BC during the Akkadian Empire reign of ruler Shar-Kali-Sharri one of whose year names mentions building two temples there. Babylon was ruled by ensi (governors) for the empire. Some of the known governors were Abba, Arši-aḫ, Itūr-ilum, Murteli, Unabatal, and Puzur-Tutu. After that nothing is heard of the city until the time of Sumu-la-El. After around 1950 BC Amorite kingdoms will appear in Uruk and Larsa in the south.\n\nOld Babylonian period\nAccording to a Babylonian king list, Amorite rule in Babylon began (c. 19th or 18th century BC) with a chieftain named Sumu-abum, who declared independence from the neighboring city-state of Kazallu. Sumu-la-El, whose dates may be concurrent with those of Sumu-abum, is usually given as the progenitor of the First Babylonian dynasty. Both are credited with building the walls of Babylon. In any case, the records describe Sumu-la-El's military successes establishing a regional sphere of influence for Babylon.\nBabylon was initially a minor city-state, and controlled little surrounding territory. Its first four Amorite rulers did not assume the title of king. The older and more powerful states of Elam, Isin, and Larsa overshadowed Babylon until it became the capital of Hammurabi's short-lived empire about a century later. Hammurabi (r. 1792–1750 BC) is famous for codifying the laws of Babylonia into the Code of Hammurabi. He conquered all of the cities and city states of southern Mesopotamia, including Isin, Larsa, Ur, Uruk, Nippur, Lagash, Eridu, Kish, Adab, Eshnunna, Akshak, Shuruppak, Bad-tibira, Sippar, and Girsu, coalescing them into one kingdom, ruled from Babylon. Hammurabi also invaded and conquered Elam to the east, and the kingdoms of Mari and Ebla to the northwest. After a conflict with the Old Assyrian period king Ishme-Dagan, he forced his successor to pay tribute late in his reign.\nAfter the reign of Hammurabi, the whole of southern Mesopotamia came to be known as Babylonia. From this time, Babylon supplanted Nippur and Eridu as the major religious centers of southern Mesopotamia. Hammurabi's empire destabilized after his death. The far south of Mesopotamia broke away, forming the native Sealand Dynasty, and the Elamites appropriated territory in eastern Mesopotamia. The Amorite dynasty remained in power in Babylon, which again became a small city state. After the destruction of the city the Kassites rose to control the region.\nTexts from Old Babylon often include references to Shamash, the sun-god of Sippar, treated as a supreme deity, and Marduk, considered as his son. Marduk was later elevated to a higher status and Shamash lowered, perhaps reflecting Babylon's rising political power.\n\nMiddle Babylon\nIn 1595 BC, the city is thought to have been sacked by Mursili I, ruler of the Hittite Empire sometime during the 31-year reign of Samsu-Ditana, last ruler of the First Dynasty of Babylon. This is based on a line in the century later Telepinu Proclamation reading \"Subsequently he marched to Babylon and he destroyed Babylon, and defeated the Hurrian troops, and brought captives and possessions of Babylon to Hattusa.\". Originally it was thought that cult statues of Babylon, including Marduk, were carried off to the Kingdom of Khana but the source Agum-Kakrime Inscription is now generally considered a much later forgery. Thereafter, the Kassite dynasty took power in the city of Babylon, renaming it Karduniash, ushering in a dynasty that lasted for 435 years, until 1160 BC.\nBabylon was weakened during the Kassite era, and as a result, Kassite Babylon began paying tribute to the Pharaoh of Egypt, Thutmose III, following his eighth campaign against Mitanni. Kassite Babylon eventually became subject to the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365–1053 BC) to the north, and Elam to the east, with both powers vying for control of the city.\nBy 1155 BC, after continued attacks and annexing of territory by the Assyrians and Elamites, the Kassites were deposed in Babylon. An Akkadian south Mesopotamian dynasty then ruled for the first time. However, Babylon remained weak and subject to domination by Assyria. Its ineffectual native kings were unable to prevent new waves of foreign West Semitic settlers from the deserts of the Levant, including the Arameans and Suteans in the 11th century BC, and finally the Chaldeans in the 9th century BC, entering and appropriating areas of Babylonia for themselves. The Arameans briefly ruled in Babylon during the late 11th century BC.\n\nAssyrian period\nDuring the rule of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–609 BC), Babylonia was under constant Assyrian domination or direct control. During the reign of Sennacherib of Assyria, Babylonia was in a constant state of revolt, led by a chieftain named Merodach-Baladan, in alliance with the Elamites, and suppressed only by the complete destruction of the city of Babylon. In 689 BC, its walls, temples and palaces were razed, and the rubble was thrown into the Arakhtu, the sea bordering the earlier Babylon on the south. The destruction of the religious center shocked many, and the subsequent murder of Sennacherib by two of his own sons while praying to the god Nisroch was considered an act of atonement.\nConsequently, his successor, Esarhaddon hastened to rebuild the old city and make it his residence for part of the year. After his death, Babylonia was governed by his elder son, the Assyrian prince Shamash-shum-ukin, who eventually started a civil war in 652 BC against his own brother, Ashurbanipal, who ruled in Nineveh. Shamash-shum-ukin enlisted the help of other peoples against Assyria, including Elam, Persia, the Chaldeans, and Suteans of southern Mesopotamia, and the Canaanites and Arabs dwelling in the deserts south of Mesopotamia.\nOnce again, Babylon was besieged by the Assyrians, starved into surrender and its allies were defeated. Ashurbanipal celebrated a \"service of reconciliation\", but did not venture to \"take the hands\" of Bel. An Assyrian governor named Kandalanu was appointed as ruler of the city. Ashurbanipal did collect texts from Babylon for inclusion in his extensive library at Ninevah.\n\nNeo-Babylonian Empire\nUnder Nabopolassar, Babylon escaped Assyrian rule, and the allied Medo-Babylonian armies destroyed the Assyrian Empire between 626 BC and 609 BC. Babylon thus became the capital of the Neo-Babylonian (sometimes called the Chaldean) Empire.\nWith the recovery of Babylonian independence, a new era of architectural activity ensued, particularly during the reign of his son Nebuchadnezzar II (604–561 BC). Nebuchadnezzar ordered the complete reconstruction of the imperial grounds, including the Etemenanki ziggurat, and the construction of the Ishtar Gate—the most prominent of eight gates around Babylon. A reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate is located in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.\nNebuchadnezzar is also credited with the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, said to have been built for his homesick wife, Amytis. Whether the gardens actually existed is a matter of dispute. German archaeologist Robert Koldewey speculated that he had discovered its foundations, but many historians disagree about the location. Stephanie Dalley has argued that the hanging gardens were actually located near the Assyrian capital, Nineveh.\nNebuchadnezzar is also notoriously associated with the Babylonian exile of the Jews, the result of an imperial technique of pacification, used also by the Assyrians, in which ethnic groups in conquered areas were deported en masse to the capital. According to the Hebrew Bible, he destroyed Solomon's Temple and exiled the Jews to Babylon. The defeat was also recorded in the Babylonian Chronicles.\n\nPersian conquest\nIn 539 BC, the Neo-Babylonian Empire fell to Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, with a military engagement known as the Battle of Opis. Babylon's walls were considered impenetrable. The only way into the city was through one of its many gates, or through the Euphrates River. Metal grates were installed underwater, allowing the river to flow through the city walls while preventing intrusion. The Persians devised a plan to enter the city via the river. During a Babylonian national feast, Cyrus' troops upstream diverted the Euphrates River, allowing Cyrus' soldiers to enter the city through the lowered water. The Persian army conquered the outlying areas of the city while the majority of Babylonians at the city center were unaware of the breach. The account was elaborated upon by Herodotus\nHerodotus also described a moat, an enormously tall and broad wall, cemented with bitumen and with buildings on top, and a hundred gates to the city. He writes that the Babylonians wear turbans and perfume and bury their dead in honey, that they practice ritual prostitution, and that three tribes among them eat nothing but fish. The hundred gates can be considered a reference to Homer. Following the pronouncement of Archibald Henry Sayce in 1883, Herodotus' account of Babylon has largely been considered to represent Greek folklore rather than an authentic voyage to Babylon. However, recently, Dalley and others have suggested taking Herodotus' account seriously.\n\nAccording to 2 Chronicles 36 of the Hebrew Bible, Cyrus later issued a decree permitting captive people, including the Jews, to return to their own lands. The text found on the Cyrus Cylinder has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of this policy, although the interpretation is disputed because the text identifies only Mesopotamian sanctuaries but makes no mention of Jews, Jerusalem, or Judea.\nUnder Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king Darius I, Babylon became the capital city of the 9th Satrapy (Babylonia in the south and Athura in the north), as well as a center of learning and scientific advancement. In Achaemenid Persia, the ancient Babylonian arts of astronomy and mathematics were revitalized, and Babylonian scholars completed maps of constellations. The city became the administrative capital of the Persian Empire and remained prominent for over two centuries. Many important archaeological discoveries have been made that can provide a better understanding of that era.\nThe early Persian kings had attempted to maintain the religious ceremonies of Marduk, who was the most important god, but by the reign of Darius III, over-taxation and the strain of numerous wars led to a deterioration of Babylon's main shrines and canals, and the destabilization of the surrounding region. There were numerous attempts at rebellion and in 522 BC (Nebuchadnezzar III), 521 BC (Nebuchadnezzar IV) and 482 BC (Bel-shimani and Shamash-eriba) native Babylonian kings briefly regained independence. However, these revolts were quickly repressed and Babylon remained under Persian rule for two centuries, until Alexander the Great's entry in 331 BC. Following his conquests, he died in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II in Babylon on the evening of 10–11 June 323 BC.\n\nHellenistic period\nIn October of 331 BC, Darius III, the last Achaemenid king of the Persian Empire, was defeated by the forces of the Ancient Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great at the Battle of Gaugamela, occupying Babylon. Under Alexander, Babylon again flourished as a center of learning and commerce. However, following Alexander's death in 323 BC in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar, his empire was divided amongst his generals, the Diadochi, and decades of fighting soon began. Babylon was within the Seleucid Empire throughout most of this period, and declined somewhat in importance but remained active.\n\nRenewed Persian rule\nUnder the Parthian and Sassanid Empires, Babylon (like Assyria) became a province of these Persian Empires for nine centuries, until after AD 650. Although it was captured briefly by Trajan in AD 116 to be part of the newly conquered province of Mesopotamia, his successor Hadrian relinquished his conquests east of the Euphrates river, which became again the Roman Empire's eastern boundary.\nHowever, Babylon maintained its own culture and people, who spoke varieties of Aramaic, and who continued to refer to their homeland as Babylon. Examples of their culture are found in the Babylonian Talmud, the Gnostic Mandaean religion, Eastern Rite Christianity and the religion of the philosopher Mani. Christianity was introduced to Mesopotamia in the 1st and 2nd centuries, and Babylon was the seat of a Bishop of the Church of the East until well after the Arab/Islamic conquest. Coins from the Parthian, Sasanian and Arabic periods excavated in Babylon demonstrate the continuity of settlement there.\n\nMuslim conquest\nIn the mid-7th century, Mesopotamia was conquered and settled by the expanding Muslim Empire, and a period of Islamization followed. Babylon was dissolved as a province and Aramaic and Church of the East Christianity eventually became marginalized. Ibn Hawqal (10th century) and Arab scholar al-Qazwini (13th century) describe Babylon (Babil) as a small village. The latter described a well referred to as the 'Dungeon of Daniel' that was visited by Christians and Jews during holidays. The grave-shrine of Amran ibn Ali was visited by Muslims.\nAccording to medieval Arabic writings, Babylon was a popular site to extract bricks, which were used to build cities from Baghdad to Basra.\nEuropean travellers, in many cases, could not discover the city's location, or mistook Fallujah for it. Benjamin of Tudela, a 12th-century traveller, mentions Babylon, but it is not clear if he went there. Others referred to Baghdad as Babylon or New Babylon and described various structures encountered in the region as the Tower of Babel. Pietro della Valle travelled to the village of Babil in Babylon in the 17th century and noted the existence of both baked and dried mudbricks cemented with bitumen.\n\nModern era\nThe eighteenth century saw an increasing flow of travellers to Babylon, including Carsten Niebuhr and Pierre-Joseph de Beauchamp, as well as measurements of its latitude. Beauchamp's memoir, published in English translation in 1792, provoked the British East India Company to direct its agents in Baghdad and Basra to acquire Mesopotamian relics for shipment to London.\nBy 1905, there were several villages in Babylon, one of which was Qwaresh with about 200 households located within the boundaries of the ancient inner city walls. The village grew due to the need for laborers during the German Oriental Society excavations between 1899 and 1917.\n\nIraqi government\nThe site of Babylon has been a cultural asset to Iraq since the creation of the modern Iraqi state in 1921. The site was officially protected and excavated by the Kingdom of Iraq under British Administration, which later became the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq, and its successors: the Arab Federation, the Iraqi Republic, Ba'athist Iraq, also officially called the Iraqi Republic, and the Republic of Iraq. Babylonian images periodically appear on Iraqi postcards and stamps. In the 1960s, a replica of the Ishtar Gate and a reconstruction of Ninmakh Temple were built on site.\nIn February 1978, the Ba'athist government of Iraq under Saddam Hussein, began the \"Archaeological Restoration of Babylon Project\": reconstructing features of the ancient city atop its ruins. These features included the Southern Palace of Nebuchadnezzar, with 250 rooms, five courtyards, and a 30-meter (98 ft) entrance arch. The project reinforced the Processional Way, the Lion of Babylon, and an amphitheater constructed in the city's Hellenistic era. In 1982, the government minted a set of seven coins, displaying iconic features of Babylon. A Babylon International Festival was held in September 1987, and annually thereafter until 2002, excepting 1990 and 1991, to showcase this work. The proposed reconstruction of the Hanging Gardens and the great ziggurat never took place.\nHussein installed a portrait of himself and Nebuchadnezzar at the entrance to the ruins and inscribed his name on many of the bricks, in imitation of Nebuchadnezzar. One frequent inscription reads \"This was built by Saddam Hussein, son of Nebuchadnezzar, to glorify Iraq.\" These bricks became sought after as collector's items after Hussein's downfall. Similar projects were conducted at Nineveh, Nimrud, Assur and Hatra, to demonstrate the magnificence of Arab achievement.\nIn the 1980s, Hussein completely removed the village of Qwaresh, displacing its residents. He later constructed a modern palace in that area called Saddam Hill, over some of the old ruins, in the pyramidal style of a ziggurat. In 2003, he intended to have a cable car line constructed over Babylon, but plans were halted by the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nUnder US and Polish occupation\nFollowing the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the area around Babylon came under the control of US troops, before being handed over to Polish forces in September 2003. US forces under the command of General James T. Conway of the I Marine Expeditionary Force were criticized for building the military base \"Camp Alpha\", with a helipad and other facilities on ancient Babylonian ruins during the Iraq War. US forces occupied the site for some time and caused irreparable damage to the archaeological record. In a report of the British Museum's Near East department, John Curtis described how parts of the archaeological site were levelled to create a landing area for helicopters, and parking lots for heavy vehicles. Curtis wrote of the occupation forces:\n\nThey caused substantial damage to the Ishtar Gate, one of the most famous monuments from antiquity [...] US military vehicles crushed 2,600-year-old brick pavements, archaeological fragments were scattered across the site, more than 12 trenches were driven into ancient deposits and military earth-moving projects contaminated the site for future generations of scientists.\nA US military spokesman claimed that engineering operations were discussed with the \"head of the Babylon museum\". The head of the Iraqi State Board for Heritage and Antiquities, Donny George, said that the \"mess will take decades to sort out\" and criticised Polish troops for causing \"terrible damage\" to the site. Poland resolved in 2004 to place the city under Iraq control, and commissioned a report titled Report Concerning the Condition of the Preservation of the Babylon Archaeological Site, which it presented at a meeting in December 2004. In 2005, the site was handed over to the Iraqi Ministry of Culture.\nIn April 2006, Colonel John Coleman, former Chief of Staff for the I Marine Expeditionary Force, offered to issue an apology for the damage done by military personnel under his command. He also claimed that the US presence had deterred far greater damage by other looters. An April 2006 article stated that UN officials and Iraqi leaders have plans to restore Babylon, making it into a cultural center.\nTwo museums and a library, containing replicas of artifacts and local maps and reports, were raided and destroyed.\n\nPresent-day\nIn May 2009, the provincial government of Babil reopened the site to tourists. Over 35,000 people visited in 2017. An oil pipeline runs through an outer wall of the city. In July 2019, the site of Babylon was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThousands of people reside in Babylon within the perimeter of the ancient outer city walls, and communities in and around them are \"rapidly developing from compact, dense settlements to sprawling suburbia despite laws restricting constructions\". Modern villages include Zwair West, Sinjar Village, Qwaresh, and Al-Jimjmah, among which the first two are better off economically. Most residents primarily depend on daily wage earning or have government jobs in Al-Hillah. Some cultivate dates, citrus fruits, figs, fodder for livestock and limited cash crops, although income from the land alone is not enough to sustain a family. Both Shi'a and Sunni Muslims live in Sinjar village, with mosques for both groups.\nThe State Board of Antiquities and Heritage (SBAH) is the main authority responsible for the conservation of the archeological site. They are assisted by Antiquity and Heritage Police, and maintain a permanent presence there. The World Monuments Fund is involved in research and conservation. The SBAH Provincial Inspectorate Headquarters is located within the boundaries of the ancient inner city walls on the east side. Several staff members and their families reside in subsidized housing in this area.\n\nCultural importance\nBefore modern archaeological excavations in Mesopotamia, the appearance of Babylon was largely a mystery, and typically envisioned by Western artists as a hybrid between ancient Egyptian, classical Greek, and contemporary Ottoman culture.\nDue to Babylon's historical significance as well as references to it in the Bible, the word \"Babylon\" in various languages has acquired a generic meaning of a large, bustling diverse city. Examples include:\n\nBabylon is used in reggae music as a concept in the Rastafari belief system, denoting the materialistic capitalist world, or any form of imperialist evil. It is believed that Babylon actively seeks to exploit and oppress the people of the world, specifically people of African descent. It is believed by Rastafarians that Babylon attempts to forbid the smoking of ganja because this sacred herb opens minds to the truth.\nBabylon 5 – A science fiction series set on a futuristic space station that acts as a trading and diplomatic nexus between many different cultures. Many stories focus on the theme of different societies and cultures uniting, respecting differences, and learning from each other rather than fighting or looking on each other with prejudice and suspicion.\nBabylon A.D. takes place in New York City, decades in the future.\nBabilonas (Lithuanian name for \"Babylon\") is a real estate development in Lithuania.\n\"Babylon\" is a song by Lady Gaga that uses allusions to ancient Biblical themes to discuss gossip.\nEternals (2021) depicts Babylon on its greatest extent and is shown to be protected and aided in its development by the titular species team.\n\nBiblical narrative\nIn Genesis 10:10, Babel (Babylon) is described as founded by Nimrod along with Uruk, Akkad and perhaps Calneh—all of them in Shinar (\"Calneh\" is now sometimes translated not as a proper name but as the phrase \"all of them\"). Another story is given in Genesis 11, which describes a united human race, speaking one language, migrating to Shinar to establish a city and tower—the Tower of Babel. God halts construction of the tower by scattering humanity across the earth and confusing their communication so they are unable to understand each other in the same language.\nAccording to 2 Kings 20:12 and Isaiah 39 of the Hebrew Bible after Hezekiah, the king of Judah, became ill, Baladan, king of Babylon, sent a letter and gifts to him. Hezekiah showed all of his treasures to the delegation, and the prophet Isaiah later said to him: \"Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD\".\nAccording to Daniel 5 the prophet Daniel lived in Babylon for most of his life. Nebuchadnezzar made Daniel ruler over the entire province of Babylon for having interpreted his dream. Years later, Belshazzar held a banquet, at which fingers of a hand appeared and wrote on a wall. Daniel was called to provide an interpretation of the writings, upon which he explained that God had put an end to Belshazzar's kingdom. Belshazzar was killed that very night, and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom.\nIsaiah 13:19 says the following regarding Babylon: \"And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.\" Jeremiah 50 says that Babylon \"shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate\".\nIn Jewish tradition, Babylon symbolizes an oppressor against which righteous believers must struggle. In Christianity, Babylon symbolizes worldliness and evil. Prophecies sometimes symbolically link the kings of Babylon with Lucifer. Nebuchadnezzar II, sometimes conflated with Nabonidus, appears as the foremost ruler in this narrative.\nThe Book of Revelation in the Christian Bible refers to Babylon many centuries after it ceased to be a major political center. The city is personified by the \"Whore of Babylon\", riding on a scarlet beast with seven heads and ten horns, and drunk on the blood of the righteous. Some scholars of apocalyptic literature believe this New Testament \"Babylon\" to be a dysphemism for the Roman Empire. Other scholars suggest that Babylon in the book of Revelation has a symbolic significance that extends beyond mere identification with the first century Roman empire.\n\nBabylon in art\nSee also\nAkitu\nCities of the ancient Near East\nEuphrates Tunnel – Legendary tunnel under the river Euphrates\nJehoiachin's Rations Tablets\nList of Kings of Babylon\nTomb of Daniel\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nCancik-Kirschbaum, Eva, Margarete van Ess, & Joachim Marzahn, eds.

          "summary": "Babylon ( BAB-il-on) was an ancient city located on the lower Euphrates river in southern Mesopotamia, within modern-day Hillah, Iraq, about 85 kilometres (53 miles) south of modern-day Baghdad. Babylon functioned as the main cultural and political centre of the Akkadian-speaking region of Babylonia. Its rulers established two important empires in antiquity, the 19th–16th century BC Old Babylonian Empire, and the 7th–6th century BC Neo-Babylonian Empire. Babylon was also used as a regional capital of other empires, such as the Achaemenid Empire. Babylon was one of the most important urban centres of the ancient Near East, until its decline during the Hellenistic period. Nearby ancient sites are Kish, Borsippa, Dilbat, and Kutha.\nThe earliest known mention of Babylon as a small town appears on a clay tablet from the reign of Shar-Kali-Sharri (2217–2193 BC), of the Akkadian Empire. Babylon was merely a religious and cultural centre at this point and was neither an independent state nor a large city. Instead, it was subject to the Akkadian Empire. After the collapse of the Akkadian Empire, the south Mesopotamian region was dominated by the Gutian Dynasty for a few decades, before the rise of the Third Dynasty of Ur, which encompassed the whole of Mesopotamia, including the town of Babylon.\nThe town became part of a small independent city-state with the rise of the first Babylonian Empire, now known as the Old Babylonian Empire, in the early second millennium BC. The Amorite king Hammurabi founded the short-lived Old Babylonian Empire in the 18th century BC. He built Babylon into a major city and declared himself its king. Southern Mesopotamia became known as Babylonia, and Babylon eclipsed Nippur as the region's holy city. The empire waned under Hammurabi's son Samsu-iluna, and Babylon spent long periods under Assyrian, Kassite and Elamite domination. After the Assyrians destroyed and then rebuilt it, Babylon became the capital of the short-lived Neo-Babylonian Empire, from 626 to 539 BC. Both the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and Walls of Babylon were ranked among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, with the former allegedly existing between approximately 600 BC and AD 1. However, there are questions about whether the Hanging Gardens of Babylon even existed, as there is no mention within any extant Babylonian texts of its existence. After the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the city came under the rule of the Achaemenid, Seleucid, Parthian, Roman, Sassanid, and Muslim empires. The last known habitation of the town dates from the 11th century, when it was referred to as the \"small village of Babel\".\nIt has been estimated that Babylon was the largest city in the world c. 1770 – c. 1670 BC, and again c. 612 – c. 320 BC. It was perhaps the first city to reach a population above 200,000. Estimates for the maximum extent of its area range from 890 (3½ sq. mi.) to 900 ha (2,200 acres). The main sources of information about Babylon—excavation of the site itself, references in cuneiform texts found elsewhere in Mesopotamia, references in the Bible, descriptions in other classical writing, especially by Herodotus, and second-hand descriptions, citing the work of Ctesias and Berossus—present an incomplete and sometimes contradictory picture of the ancient city, even at its peak in the sixth century BC. UNESCO inscribed Babylon as a World Heritage Site in 2019. The site receives thousands of visitors each year, almost all of whom are Iraqis. Construction is rapidly increasing, which has caused encroachments upon the ruins.\nBabylon stopped functioning as an urban centre between the 2nd century BC and the 7th century CE. Over those 700 years, it gradually declined from a major city to near-total abandonment. Small communities have continued to live in the area, and nearby towns such as Hillah remain inhabited on the historical site.",

          "content": "The Ishtar Gate was the eighth gate to the inner city wall of Babylon (in the area of present-day Hillah, Babylon Governorate, Iraq). It was constructed c. 569 BC by order of King Nebuchadnezzar II on the north side of the city. It was part of a grand walled processional way leading into the city.\nThe original structure was a double gate with a smaller frontal gate and a larger and more grandiose secondary posterior section. The walls were finished in glazed bricks mostly in blue, with animals and deities (also made up of coloured bricks) in low relief at intervals. The gate was 15 metres high, and the original foundations extended another 14 metres underground.\nGerman archaeologist Robert Koldewey led the excavation of the site from 1904 to 1914. After the end of the First World War in 1918, the smaller frontal gate was reconstructed in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.\nOther panels from the façade of the gate are located in many other museums around the world.\nThe façade of the Iraqi embassy in Beijing, China, includes a replica of the Ishtar Gate. The façades of the Iraqi embassies in Amman, Jordan, and Islamabad, Pakistan, also evoke the Ishtar Gate.\n\nHistory\nKing Nebuchadnezzar II reigned 604–562 BC, the peak of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. He is known as the biblical conqueror who captured Jerusalem. He ordered the construction of the gate and dedicated it to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar. The gate was constructed using glazed brick with alternating rows of bas-relief mušḫuššu (dragons), aurochs (bulls), and lions, symbolizing the gods Marduk, Adad, and Ishtar respectively.\nThe roof and doors of the gate were made of cedar, according to the dedication plaque. The bricks in the gate were covered in a blue glaze meant to represent lapis lazuli, a deep-blue semi-precious stone that was revered in antiquity due to its vibrancy. The blue-glazed bricks would have given the façade a jewel-like shine. Through the gate ran the Processional Way, which was lined with walls showing about 120 lions, bulls, dragons, and flowers on yellow and black glazed bricks, symbolizing the goddess Ishtar. The gate itself depicted only gods and goddesses. These included Ishtar, Adad, and Marduk. During celebrations of the New Year, statues of the deities were paraded through the gate and down the Processional Way.\n\nDesign\nThe front of the gate has a low-relief design with a repeated pattern of images of two of the major gods of the Babylonian pantheon. Marduk, the national deity and chief god, with his servant dragon Mušḫuššu, is depicted as a dragon with a snake-like head and tail, a scaled body of a lion, and powerful talons for back feet. Marduk was seen as the divine champion of good against evil, and the incantations of the Babylonians often sought his protection.\n\nThe second god shown in the pattern of reliefs on the Ishtar Gate is Adad (also known as Ishkur), whose sacred animal was the aurochs, a now-extinct ancestor of cattle. Adad had power over destructive storms and beneficial rain. The design of the Ishtar Gate also includes linear borders and patterns of rosettes, often seen as symbols of fertility.\nThe bricks of the Ishtar gate were made from finely textured clay pressed into wooden forms. Each of the animal reliefs was also made from bricks formed by pressing clay into reusable molds. Seams between the bricks were carefully planned not to occur on the eyes of the animals or any other aesthetically unacceptable places. The bricks were sun-dried and then fired once before glazing. The clay was brownish red in this bisque-fired state.\nThe background glazes are mainly a vivid blue, which imitates the color of the highly prized lapis lazuli. Gold and brown glazes are used for animal images. The borders and rosettes are glazed in black, white, and gold. It is believed that the glaze recipe used plant ash, sandstone conglomerates, and pebbles for silicates. This combination was repeatedly melted, cooled, and then pulverized. This mixture of silica and fluxes is called a frit. Color-producing minerals, such as cobalt, were added in the final glaze formulations. This was then painted onto the bisque-fired bricks and fired to a higher temperature in a glaze firing.\nThe creation of the gate out of wood and clay glazed to look like lapis lazuli could possibly be a reference to the goddess Inanna, who became syncretized with the goddess Ishtar during the reign of Sargon of Akkad. In the myth of Inanna's descent to the underworld, Inanna is described as donning seven accoutrements of lapis lazuli symbolizing her divine power. Once captured by the queen of the underworld, Inanna is described as being lapis lazuli, silver, and wood, two of these materials being key components in the construction of the Ishtar Gate. The creation of the gate out of wood and \"lapis lazuli\" linking the gate to being part of the Goddess herself.\nAfter the glaze firing, the bricks were assembled, leaving narrow horizontal seams from one to six millimeters. The seams were then sealed with a naturally occurring black viscous substance called bitumen, like modern asphalt. The Ishtar Gate is only one small part of the design of ancient Babylon that also included the palace, temples, an inner fortress, walls, gardens, other gates, and the Processional Way. The lavish city was decorated with over 15 million baked bricks, according to estimates.\n\nThe main gate led to the Southern Citadel, the gate itself seeming to be a part of Imgur-Bel and Nimitti-Bel, two of the most prominent defensive walls of Babylon. There were three primary entrances to the Ishtar Gate: the central entrance which contained the double gate structure (two sets of double doors, for a fourfold door structure), and doors flanking the main entrance to the left and right, both containing the signature double door structure.\n\nIshtar Gate and Processional Way\nOnce per year, the Ishtar Gate and connecting Processional Way were used for a New Year's procession, which was part of a religious festival celebrating the beginning of the agricultural year. In Babylon, the rituals surrounding this holiday lasted twelve days. The New Year's celebrations started immediately after the barley harvest, at the time of the vernal equinox. This was the first day of the ancient month of Nisan, equivalent to today's date of March 20 or 21.\nThe Processional Way, which has been traced to a length of over 800 meters, extended north from the Ishtar Gate and was designed with brick relief images of lions, the symbol of the goddess Ishtar (also known as Inanna) the war goddess, the dragon of Marduk, the lord of the gods, and the bull of Adad, the storm god. Worshipped as the Mistress of Heaven, Ishtar represented the power of sexual attraction and was thought to be savage and determined. Symbolized by the star and her sacred animal, the lion, she was also the goddess of war and the protector of ruling dynasties and their armies. The idea of protection of the city is further incorporated into this gateway design by the use of crenelated buttresses along both sides to this entrance into the city.\nFriezes with sixty ferocious lions representing Ishtar decorated each side of the Processional Way, designed with variations in the color of the fur and the manes. On the east side, they had a left foot forward, and on the west side, they had the right foot forward. Each lion was made of forty-six molded bricks in eleven rows. The lion is pictured upon a blue enameled tile background and an orange coloured border that runs along the very bottom portion of the wall. Having a white body and yellow mane, the lion of Ishtar was an embodiment of vivid naturalism that further enhanced the glory of Babylon's Procession Street.\nThe purpose of the New Year's holiday was to affirm the supremacy of Marduk and his representative on Earth, the king, and to offer thanks for the fertility of the land.\nThe Processional Way was paved with large stone pieces set in a bed of bitumen and was up to 66 feet (20 meters) wide at some points. This street ran from the Euphrates through the temple district and palaces and onto the Ishtar Gate.\n\nInscription of Nebuchadnezzar II\nThe inscription of the Ishtar Gate is written in Akkadian cuneiform in white and blue glazed bricks and was a dedication by Nebuchadnezzar to explain the gate's purpose. On the wall of the Ishtar Gate, the inscription is 15 meters tall by 10 meters wide and includes 60 lines of writing. The inscription was created around the same time as the gate's construction, around 605–562 BC.\nInscription:\n\nNebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, the pious prince appointed by the will of Marduk, the highest priestly prince, beloved of Nabu, of prudent deliberation, who has learnt to embrace wisdom, who fathomed Their (Marduk and Nabu) godly being and pays reverence to their Majesty, the untiring Governor, who always has at heart the care of the cult of Esagila and Ezida and is constantly concerned with the well being of Babylon and Borsippa, the wise, the humble, the caretaker of Esagila and Ezida, the first born son of Nabopolassar, the King of Babylon, am I.\nBoth gate entrances of the (city walls) Imgur-Ellil and Nemetti-Ellil following the filling of the street from Babylon had become increasingly lower. (Therefore,) I pulled down these gates and laid their foundations at the water table with asphalt and bricks and had them made of bricks with blue stone on which wonderful bulls and dragons were depicted. I covered their roofs by laying majestic cedars lengthwise over them. I fixed doors of cedar wood adorned with bronze at all the gate openings. I placed wild bulls and ferocious dragons in the gateways and thus adorned them with luxurious splendor so that Mankind might gaze on them in wonder.\n\nI let the temple of Esiskursiskur, the highest festival house of Marduk, the lord of the gods, a place of joy and jubilation for the major and minor deities, be built firm like a mountain in the precinct of Babylon of asphalt and fired bricks.\n\nExcavation and display\nA reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate and Processional Way was built at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin out of material excavated by Robert Koldewey. It includes the inscription plaque. It stands 14 m (46 ft) high and 30 m (100 ft) wide. The excavation ran from 1902 to 1914, and, during that time, 14 m (46 ft) of the foundation of the gate was uncovered.\n\nClaudius Rich, British resident of Baghdad and a self-taught historian, did personal research on Babylon because it intrigued him. Acting as a scholar and collecting field data, he was determined to discover the wonders to the ancient world. Rich's topographical records of the ruins in Babylon were the first ever published, in 1815. It was reprinted in England no fewer than three times. Rich and most other 19th-century visitors thought a mound in Babylon was a royal palace, and that was eventually confirmed by Robert Koldewey's excavations, who found two palaces of King Nebuchadnezzar and the Ishtar Gate. Robert Koldewey, a successful German excavator, had done previous work for the Royal Museum of Berlin, with his excavations at Surghul (Ancient Nina) and Al-hiba (ancient Lagash) in 1887. Koldewey's part in Babylon's excavation began in 1899.\nThe method that the British were comfortable with was excavating tunnels and deep trenches, which was damaging the mud brick architecture of the foundation. Instead, it was suggested that the excavation team focus on tablets and other artifacts rather than pick at the crumbling buildings. Despite the destructive nature of the archaeology used, the recording of data was immensely more thorough than in previous Mesopotamian excavations. Walter Andrae, one of Koldewey's many assistants, was an architect and a draftsman, the first at Babylon. His contribution was documentation and reconstruction of Babylon, and then later, the smuggling of the remains out of Iraq and into Germany. A small museum was built at the site, and Andrae was the museum's first director.\nAs the German Oriental Society had provided such large funding for the project, the German archeologists involved felt that they needed to justify the cost by smuggling much of the material back to Germany. For example, of the 120 lion friezes along the Procession Street, the Germans took 118. Walter Andrae played a key role in this endeavor using the strong links (or wasta) that he had cultivated with German intelligence officers and with local Iraqi tribal sheikhs. The Gate's ceramic pieces were disassembled according to a complex numbering system and were then packed in straw in coal barrels in order to disguise them. These barrels were then transported down the Euphrates River to Shatt al-Arab, where they were loaded onto German ships and taken to Berlin.\nThe rebuilding of Babylon's Ishtar Gate and Processional Way in Berlin was one of the most complex architectural reconstructions in the history of archaeology. Hundreds of crates of glazed brick fragments were carefully desalinated and then pieced together. Fragments were combined with new bricks fired in a specially designed kiln to re-create the correct color and finish. It was a double gate; the part that is shown in the Pergamon Museum today is the smaller, frontal part. The larger, back part was considered too large to fit into the constraints of the structure of the museum; it is in storage.\nParts of the gate and animals from the Processional Way are in various other museums around the world. Only four museums acquired dragons, while lions went to several museums. The Istanbul Archaeology Museum has lions, dragons, and bulls. Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen, Denmark, has one lion, one dragon and one bull. The Detroit Institute of Arts houses a dragon. The Röhsska Museum in Gothenburg, Sweden, has one dragon and one lion; the Louvre, the State Museum of Egyptian Art in Munich, the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Oriental Institute in Chicago, the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut, each have lions.\nA smaller reproduction of the gate was built in Iraq under Saddam Hussein as the entrance to a museum that has not been completed. Along with the restored palace, the gate was completed in 1987. The construction was meant to emulate the techniques that were used for the original gate. The replica appears similar to the restored original but is notably smaller. The purpose of the replica's construction was an attempt to reconnect to Iraq's history. Damage to this reproduction has occurred since the Iraq War (see Impact of the U.S. military).\n\nControversy and attempted repatriation\nThe acquisition of the Ishtar Gate by the Pergamon Museum is surrounded in controversy as the gate was excavated as part of the excavation of Babylon, and immediately shipped off to Berlin where it remains to this day. The government of Iraq has petitioned the German government to return the gate many times, notably in 2002 as well as in 2009. The Ishtar Gate is frequently used as a prime example in the debate regarding repatriating artifacts of cultural significance to countries affected by war and whether these pieces of material culture are better off in a safer environment where they could be preserved. The example in the case of the Ishtar Gate is concerning its safety in the aftermath of the Iraq War, and whether or not the gate would be safer remaining at the Pergamon Museum where it was damaged by bombs in World War II.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nMatson, F.R.

          "summary": "The Ishtar Gate was the eighth gate to the inner city wall of Babylon (in the area of present-day Hillah, Babylon Governorate, Iraq). It was constructed c. 569 BC by order of King Nebuchadnezzar II on the north side of the city. It was part of a grand walled processional way leading into the city.\nThe original structure was a double gate with a smaller frontal gate and a larger and more grandiose secondary posterior section. The walls were finished in glazed bricks mostly in blue, with animals and deities (also made up of coloured bricks) in low relief at intervals. The gate was 15 metres high, and the original foundations extended another 14 metres underground.\nGerman archaeologist Robert Koldewey led the excavation of the site from 1904 to 1914. After the end of the First World War in 1918, the smaller frontal gate was reconstructed in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.\nOther panels from the façade of the gate are located in many other museums around the world.\nThe façade of the Iraqi embassy in Beijing, China, includes a replica of the Ishtar Gate. The façades of the Iraqi embassies in Amman, Jordan, and Islamabad, Pakistan, also evoke the Ishtar Gate.",

          "title": "Hanging Gardens of Babylon",
          "content": "The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq. The Hanging Gardens' name is derived from the Greek word κρεμαστός (kremastós, lit. 'overhanging'), which has a broader meaning than the modern English word \"hanging\" and refers to trees being planted on a raised structure such as a terrace.\nAccording to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as The Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife, Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by Josephus. The construction of the Hanging Gardens has also been attributed to the legendary queen Semiramis and they have been called the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis as an alternative name.\nThe Hanging Gardens are the only one of the Seven Wonders whose location has not been definitively established. No extant Babylonian texts mention the gardens and no definitive archaeological evidence has been found in Babylon. Three theories have been suggested to account for this: first, that the gardens were purely mythical, and the descriptions found in ancient Greek and Roman writings (including those of Strabo, Diodorus Siculus and Quintus Curtius Rufus) represented a romantic ideal of an eastern garden; second, that they existed in Babylon but were destroyed sometime around the first century AD; and third, that the legend refers to a well-documented garden that the Assyrian King Sennacherib (704–681 BC) built in his capital city of Nineveh on the River Tigris, near the modern city of Mosul.\n\nDescriptions in classical literature\nThere are five principal writers whose descriptions of Babylon exist in some form today. These writers concern themselves with the size of the Hanging Gardens, their overall design and means of irrigation, and why they were built.\nJosephus (c. 37–100 AD) quotes a description of the gardens by Berossus, a Babylonian priest of Marduk, whose writing c. 290 BC is the earliest known mention of the gardens. Berossus described the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II and is the only source to credit that king with the construction of the Hanging Gardens.\n\nIn this palace he erected very high walls, supported by stone pillars; and by planting what was called a pensile paradise, and replenishing it with all sorts of trees, he rendered the prospect an exact resemblance of a mountainous country. This he did to gratify his queen, because she had been brought up in Media, and was fond of a mountainous situation.\n\nDiodorus Siculus (active c. 60–30 BC) seems to have consulted the 4th century BC texts of both Cleitarchus (a historian of Alexander the Great) and Ctesias of Cnidus. Diodorus ascribes the construction to a \"Syrian king\". He states that the garden was in the shape of a square, with each side approximately four plethra long. The garden was tiered, with the uppermost gallery being 50 cubits high. The walls, 22 feet thick, were made of brick. The bases of the tiered sections were sufficiently deep to provide root growth for the largest trees, and the gardens were irrigated from the nearby Euphrates.\nQuintus Curtius Rufus (fl. 1st century AD) probably drew on the same sources as Diodorus. He states that the gardens were located on top of a citadel, which was 20 stadia in circumference. He attributes the building of the gardens to a \"Syrian king\", again for the reason that his queen missed her homeland.\nThe account of Strabo (c. 64 BC – 21 AD) possibly based his description on the lost account of Onesicritus from the 4th century BC. He states that the gardens were watered by means of an Archimedes' screw leading to the gardens from the Euphrates river.\nThe last of the classical sources thought to be independent of the others is A Handbook to the Seven Wonders of the World by the paradoxographer Philo of Byzantium, writing in the 4th to 5th century AD (not to be confused with the earlier engineer of the same name). The method of raising water by screw matches that described by Strabo. Philo praises the engineering and ingenuity of building vast areas of deep soil, which had a tremendous mass, so far above the natural grade of the surrounding land, as well as the irrigation techniques.\n\nHistorical existence\nIt is unclear whether the Hanging Gardens were an actual construction or a poetic creation, owing to the lack of documentation in contemporaneous Babylonian sources. There is also no mention of Nebuchadnezzar's wife Amytis (or any other wives), although a political marriage to a Median or Persian would not have been unusual. Many records exist of Nebuchadnezzar's works, yet his long and complete inscriptions do not mention any garden. However, the gardens were said to still exist at the time that later writers described them, and some of these accounts are regarded as deriving from people who had visited Babylon. Herodotus, who describes Babylon in his Histories, does not mention the Hanging Gardens, although it could be that the gardens were not yet well known to the Greeks at the time of his visit.\nTo date, no archaeological evidence has been found at Babylon for the Hanging Gardens. It is possible that evidence exists beneath the Euphrates, which cannot be excavated safely at present. The river flowed east of its current position during the time of Nebuchadnezzar II, and little is known about the western portion of Babylon. Rollinger has suggested that Berossus attributed the Gardens to Nebuchadnezzar for political reasons, and that he had adopted the legend from elsewhere.\n\nIdentification with Sennacherib's gardens at Nineveh\nOxford scholar Stephanie Dalley has proposed that the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were actually the well-documented gardens constructed by the Assyrian king Sennacherib (reigned 704–681 BC) for his palace at Nineveh; Dalley posits that during the intervening centuries the two sites became confused, and the extensive gardens at Sennacherib's palace were attributed to Nebuchadnezzar II's Babylon. Archaeological excavations have found traces of a vast system of aqueducts attributed to Sennacherib by an inscription on its remains, which Dalley proposes were part of an 80-kilometre (50 mi) series of canals, dams, and aqueducts used to carry water to Nineveh with water-raising screws used to raise it to the upper levels of the gardens.\nDalley bases her arguments on recent developments in the analysis of contemporary Akkadian inscriptions. Her main points are:\n\nThe name Babylon, meaning \"Gate of the Gods\", was the name given to several Mesopotamian cities. Sennacherib renamed the city gates of Nineveh after gods, which suggests that he wished his city to be considered \"a Babylon\".\nOnly Josephus names Nebuchadnezzar as the king who built the gardens; although Nebuchadnezzar left many inscriptions, none mentions any garden or engineering works. Diodorus Siculus and Quintus Curtius Rufus specify a \"Syrian\" king. By contrast, Sennacherib left written descriptions, and there is archaeological evidence of his water engineering. His grandson Assurbanipal pictured the mature garden on a sculptured wall panel in his palace.\nSennacherib called his new palace and garden \"a wonder for all peoples\". He describes the making and operation of screws to raise water in his garden.\nThe descriptions of the classical authors fit closely to these contemporary records. Before the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC Alexander the Great camped for four days near the aqueduct at Jerwan. The historians who travelled with him would have had ample time to investigate the enormous works around them, recording them in Greek. These first-hand accounts have not survived into modern times, but were quoted by later Greek writers.\nKing Sennacherib's garden was well-known not just for its beauty – a year-round oasis of lush green in a dusty summer landscape – but also for the marvelous feats of water engineering that maintained the garden. There was a tradition of Assyrian royal garden building. King Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 BC) had created a canal, which cut through the mountains. Fruit tree orchards were planted. Also mentioned were pines, cypresses and junipers, almond trees, date trees, ebony, rosewood, olive, oak, tamarisk, walnut, terebinth, ash, fir, pomegranate, pear, quince, fig, and grapes. A sculptured wall panel of Assurbanipal shows the garden in its maturity. One original panel and the drawing of another are held by the British Museum, although neither is on public display. Several features mentioned by the classical authors are discernible on these contemporary images.\n\nOf Sennacherib's palace, he mentions the massive limestone blocks that reinforce the flood defences. Parts of the palace were excavated by Austin Henry Layard in the mid-19th century. His citadel plan shows contours which would be consistent with Sennacherib's garden, but its position has not been confirmed. The area has been used as a military base in recent times, making it difficult to investigate further.\nThe irrigation of such a garden demanded an upgraded water supply to the city of Nineveh. The canals stretched over 50 kilometres (31 mi) into the mountains. Sennacherib was proud of the technologies he had employed and describes them in some detail on his inscriptions. At the headwater of Bavian (Khinnis) his inscription mentions automatic sluice gates. An enormous aqueduct crossing the valley at Jerwan was constructed of over two million dressed stones. It used stone arches and waterproof cement. On it is written:\n\nSennacherib king of the world king of Assyria. Over a great distance I had a watercourse directed to the environs of Nineveh, joining together the waters.... Over steep-sided valleys I spanned an aqueduct of white limestone blocks, I made those waters flow over it.\nSennacherib claimed that he had built a \"Wonder for all Peoples\", and said he was the first to deploy a new casting technique in place of the \"lost-wax\" process for his monumental (30 tonne) bronze castings. He was able to bring the water into his garden at a high level because it was sourced from further up in the mountains, and he then raised the water even higher by deploying his new water screws. This meant he could build a garden that towered above the landscape with large trees on the top of the terraces – a stunning artistic effect that surpassed those of his predecessors.\n\nPlants\nThe gardens, as depicted in artworks, featured blossoming flowers, ripe fruit, burbling waterfalls and terraces exuberant with rich foliage. Based on Babylonian literature, tradition, and the environmental characteristics of the area, some of the following plants may have been found in the gardens:\n\nOlive (Olea europaea)\nQuince (Cydonia oblonga)\nCommon pear (Pyrus communis)\nFig (Ficus carica)\nAlmond (Prunus dulcis)\nCommon grape vine (Vitis vinifera)\nDate palm (Phoenix dactylifera)\nAthel tamarisk (Tamarix aphylla)\nMt. Atlas mastic tree (Pistacia atlantica)\nImported plant varieties that may have been present in the gardens include cedar, cypress, ebony, pomegranate, plum, rosewood, terebinth, juniper, oak, ash tree, fir, myrrh, walnut, and willow. Some of these plants were suspended over the terraces and draped over its walls with arches underneath.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nSources\nFinkel, Irving (1988). \"The Hanging Gardens of Babylon\".

They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq. The Hanging Gardens' name is derived from the Greek word κρεμαστός (kremastós, lit. 'overhanging'), which has a broader meaning than the modern English word \"hanging\" and refers to trees being planted on a raised structure such as a terrace.\nAccording to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as The Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife, Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by Josephus. The construction of the Hanging Gardens has also been attributed to the legendary queen Semiramis and they have been called the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis as an alternative name.\nThe Hanging Gardens are the only one of the Seven Wonders whose location has not been definitively established. No extant Babylonian texts mention the gardens and no definitive archaeological evidence has been found in Babylon. Three theories have been suggested to account for this: first, that the gardens were purely mythical, and the descriptions found in ancient Greek and Roman writings (including those of Strabo, Diodorus Siculus and Quintus Curtius Rufus) represented a romantic ideal of an eastern garden; second, that they existed in Babylon but were destroyed sometime around the first century AD; and third, that the legend refers to a well-documented garden that the Assyrian King Sennacherib (704–681 BC) built in his capital city of Nineveh on the River Tigris, near the modern city of Mosul.",

          "content": "Ur ( or ) was a major Sumerian city-state in ancient Mesopotamia, located at the site of modern Tell el-Muqayyar (Arabic: تَلّ ٱلْمُقَيَّر, lit. 'mound of bitumen') in Dhi Qar Governorate, southern Iraq. Although Ur was a coastal city near the mouth of the Euphrates on the Persian Gulf, the coastline has shifted and the site is now well inland, on the south bank of the Euphrates, 16 km (10 mi) southwest of  Nasiriyah in modern-day Iraq. The city dates from the Ubaid period c. 3800 BC, and is recorded in written history as a city-state from the 26th century BC, its first recorded king being Mesannepada.\nThe city's patron deity was the moon god Nanna (Sin in Akkadian), and the name of the city is derived from UNUGKI, literally \"the abode (of Nanna)\". The site is marked by the partially restored ruins of the Ziggurat of Ur, which contained the shrine of Nanna, excavated in the 1930s. The temple was built in the 21st century BC (short chronology), during the reign of Ur-Nammu and was reconstructed in the 6th century BC by Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon.\n\nSociety and culture\nArchaeological discoveries have shown that Ur was a major Sumerian urban center on the Mesopotamian plain. The discovery of Ur's Royal Tombs further confirmed this. These tombs, which date to the Early Dynastic IIIa period (approximately in the 25th or 24th century BC), contained many luxury items made of precious metals and semi-precious stones imported from long distances (Ancient Iran, Afghanistan, India, Asia Minor, the Levant and the Persian Gulf). This immense wealth shows Ur's economic importance during the Early Bronze Age.\n\nExcavation in the old city of Ur in 1929 revealed the Lyres of Ur, instruments similar to the modern harp but in the shape of a bull and with eleven strings.\n\nHistory\nThe site consists of a mound, roughly 1200 by 800 metres with a height of about 20 metres above the plain. The mound is split by the remnants of an ancient canal into north and south portions. \nThe remains of a city wall are visible surrounding the site. The occupation size ranged from about 15 hectares in the Jemdet Nasr period to 90 hectares in the Early Dynastic period and then peaking in the Ur III period at 108 hectares and the Isin-Larsa period at 140 hectares, extending beyond the city walls. Subsequent period had varying lesser degrees of occupation.\n\nPrehistory\nWhen Ur was founded, it was near the coastline of the Persian Gulf. Ur is thought, therefore, to have had marshy surroundings; irrigation would have been unnecessary, and the city's evident canals likely were used for transportation. Fish, birds, tubers, and reeds might have supported Ur economically without the need for an agricultural revolution sometimes hypothesized as a prerequisite to urbanization.\n\nPrehistoric Ubaid period\nArchaeologists have discovered evidence of early occupation at Ur during the Ubaid period (c. 5500–3700 BC), a prehistoric period of Mesopotamia. The name derives from Tell al-'Ubaid where the earliest large excavation of Ubaid period material was conducted initially in 1919 by Henry Hall and later by Leonard Woolley.\nLater, a layer of soil covered the occupation levels from the Ubaid period. Excavators of the 1920s interpreted the layer of soil as evidence for the Great Flood of the Epic of Gilgamesh and Book of Genesis. It is now understood that the South Mesopotamian plain was exposed to regular floods from the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers, with heavy erosion from water and wind, which may have given rise to the Mesopotamian and derivative Biblical Great Flood stories.\n\nEarly Bronze Age\nThere are various main sources informing scholars about the importance of Ur during the Early Bronze Age.\n\nEarly Dynastic period II\nProto-cuneiform tablets from the Early Dynastic period, c. 2900 BC, have been recovered.\n\nEarly Dynastic period III\nThe First Dynasty of Ur seems to have had great wealth and power, as shown by the lavish remains of the Royal Cemetery at Ur. The Sumerian King List provides a tentative political history of ancient Sumer and mentions, among others, several rulers of Ur. Mesannepada is the first king mentioned in the Sumerian King List, and appears to have lived in the 26th century BC. That Ur was an important urban centre already then seems to be indicated by a type of cylinder seal called the City Seals. These seals contain a set of Proto-Cuneiform signs which appear to be writings or symbols of the name of city-states in ancient Mesopotamia. Many of these seals have been found in Ur, and the name of Ur is prominent on them.\n\nAkkadian period\nUr came under the control of the Semitic-speaking Akkadian Empire (c. 2334–2154 BC) founded by Sargon the Great between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC. This was a period when the Semitic-speaking Akkadians, who had entered Mesopotamia in approximately 3000 BC, gained ascendancy over the Sumerians, and indeed much of the ancient Near East.\n\nUr III period\nAfter a short period of chaos following the fall of the Akkadian Empire the third Ur dynasty was established when the king Ur-Nammu came to power, ruling between c. 2047 BC and 2030 BC. During his rule, temples, including the Ziggurat of Ur, were built, and agriculture was improved through irrigation. His code of laws, the Code of Ur-Nammu (a fragment was identified in Istanbul in 1952) is one of the oldest such documents known, preceding the Code of Hammurabi by 300 years. He and his successor Shulgi were both deified during their reigns, and after his death he continued as a hero-figure: one of the surviving works of Sumerian literature describes the death of Ur-Nammu and his journey to the underworld.\nUr-Nammu was succeeded by Shulgi, the greatest king of the Third Dynasty of Ur, who solidified the hegemony of Ur and reformed the empire into a highly centralized bureaucratic state. Shulgi ruled for a long time (at least 42 years) and deified himself halfway through his rule.\n\nThe Ur empire continued through the reigns of three more kings with Akkadian names, Amar-Sin, Shu-Sin, and Ibbi-Sin. It fell around 1940 BC to the Elamites in the 24th regnal year of Ibbi-Sin, an event commemorated by the Lament for Ur.\nAccording to one estimate, Ur was the largest city in the world from c. 2030 to 1980 BC. Its population was approximately 65,000 (or 0.1 per cent share of global population then).\n\nMiddle Bronze Age\nThe site was occupied in the Isin-Larsa and Old Babylonian periods. The city of Ur lost its political power after the demise of the Third Dynasty of Ur. Nevertheless, its important position which kept on providing access to the Persian Gulf ensured the ongoing economic importance of the city during the second millennium BC. The city came to be ruled by the  Amorite first dynasty of Babylon which rose to prominence in southern Mesopotamia in the 19th century BC. During the Old Babylonian Empire, in the reign of Samsu-iluna, Ur was abandoned. It later became a part of the native Sealand Dynasty for several centuries.\n\nLate Bronze Age\nIt then came under the control of the Kassites in the 16th century BC, and sporadically under the control of the Middle Assyrian Empire between the 14th and 11th centuries BC.\n\nIron Age\nThe city, along with the rest of southern Mesopotamia and much of the Near East, Asia Minor, North Africa and southern Caucasus, fell to the north Mesopotamian Neo-Assyrian Empire from the 10th to late 7th centuries BC. From the end of the 7th century BC Ur was ruled by the so-called Chaldean Dynasty of Babylon. In the 6th century BC there was new construction in Ur under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. The last Babylonian king, Nabonidus, improved the ziggurat. However, the city started to decline from around 530 BC after Babylonia fell to the Persian Achaemenid Empire, and was no longer inhabited by the early 5th century BC. The demise of Ur was perhaps owing to drought, changing river patterns, and the silting of the outlet to the Persian Gulf.\n\nIdentification with the Biblical Ur\nUr is possibly the city of Ur Kasdim mentioned in the Book of Genesis as the birthplace of the Jewish patriarch Abraham, traditionally believed to have lived some time in the 2nd millennium BC. There are, however, conflicting traditions and scholarly opinions identifying Ur Kasdim with the sites of Şanlıurfa, Urkesh, Urartu, or Kutha.\nThe biblical Ur is mentioned four times in the Torah or Hebrew Bible (Tanakh in Hebrew), with the distinction \"of the Kasdim\"—traditionally rendered in English as \"Ur of the Chaldees\". The Chaldeans had settled in the vicinity by around 850 BC, but were not extant anywhere in Mesopotamia during the 2nd millennium BC period when Abraham is traditionally held to have lived. The Chaldean dynasty did not rule Babylonia (and thus become the rulers of Ur) until the late 7th century BC, and held power only until the mid 6th century BC. The name is found in Genesis 11:28, Genesis 11:31, and Genesis 15:7. In Nehemiah 9:7, a single passage mentioning Ur is a paraphrase of Genesis.\nPope John Paul II wanted to visit the city according to the biblical tradition as part of his trip to Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories but the visit was cancelled due to a dispute between the Government of Saddam Hussein and representatives of the Holy See.\nIn March 2021, Pope Francis visited Ur during his journey through Iraq.\n\nArchaeology\nIn 1625, the site was visited by Pietro Della Valle, who recorded the presence of ancient bricks stamped with strange symbols, cemented together with bitumen, as well as inscribed pieces of black marble that appeared to be seals. He retrieved several inscribed bricks. It was visited in 1835 by James Baillie Fraser and John Ross who provided a detailed description. In January 1850 William Loftus and H. A. Churchill visited the site and collected brick inscriptions. European archaeologists did not identify Tell el-Muqayyar as the site of Ur until Henry Rawlinson successfully deciphered some bricks from that location, brought to England by William Loftus.\n\nThe site was first excavated, on behalf of the British Museum and with instructions from the Foreign Office, by John George Taylor, British vice consul at Basra in 1853, 1854, and again in 1858. It had long been thought that Taylor only worked at the site in 1853 and 1854 but a 48 page handwritten report of his work there in 1858 has now come to light. Finds from the dig included a carved stone with integral handle, a plaque with woman's face, and a  foundation cone of A'annepada. Taylor uncovered the Ziggurat of Ur and a structure with an arch later identified as part of the \"Gate of Judgment\". Among the finds were copies of a standard cylinder of Nabonidus, Neo-Babylonian ruler, mentioning the prince regent Belshar-uzur, usually thought to be the Belshazzar of the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible. Between 1854 and 1918 locals excavated over two hundred tablets from the site, mostly from the temple Ê-nun-maḫ, of the moon god Sin. Built by the Ur III ruler Ur-Nammu, the ziggurat was later repaired by Isin ruler Ishme-Dagan early in the 2nd millennium BC. Stamped bricks on the ziggurat detail the rebuilding of the temple of Ningal by 14th century BC Kassite ruler Kurigalzu I.\nSome cuneiform tablets were found. Thirty four of these tablets were inadvertently mixed in with those excavated at Kutalla. Only in recent years has this error been recognized. Typical of the era, his excavations destroyed information and exposed the tell. Natives used the now loosened, 4,000-year-old bricks and tile for construction for the next 75 years, while the site lay unexplored, the British Museum having decided to prioritize archaeology in Assyria.\nThe site was considered rich in remains, and relatively easy to explore. After some soundings were made during a week in 1918 by Reginald Campbell Thompson, H. R. Hall worked the site for one season (using 70 Turkish prisoners of war) for the British Museum in 1919, laying the groundwork for more extensive efforts to follow. Some cuneiform tablets from the Isin-Larsa period were found, including omen and medical texts. They are now in the British Museum.\n\nExcavations from 1922 to 1934 were funded by the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania and led by the archaeologist Sir Charles Leonard Woolley. The last two seasons focused on closing the site properly. A total of about 1,850 burials were uncovered, including 16 that were described as \"royal tombs\" containing many valuable artifacts, including the Standard of Ur. Most of the royal tombs were dated to about 2600 BC. The finds included the unlooted tomb of a queen thought to be Queen Puabi (formerly transcribed as Shub-ab), known from a cylinder seal found in the tomb, although there were two other different and unnamed seals found in the tomb. Many other people had been buried with her, in a form of human sacrifice. Near the ziggurat were uncovered the temple E-nun-mah and buildings E-dub-lal-mah (built for a king), E-gi-par (residence of the high priestess) and E-hur-sag (a temple building).\nOutside the temple area, many houses used in everyday life were found. Excavations were also made below the royal tombs layer: a 3.5-metre-thick (11 ft) layer of alluvial clay covered the remains of earlier habitation, including pottery from the Ubaid period, the first stage of settlement in southern Mesopotamia. Woolley later wrote many articles and books about the discoveries. One of Woolley's assistants on the site was the British archaeologist Max Mallowan.\n\nA number of royal inscriptions were found during the Woolley excavations. Numerous cuneiform tablets were also recovered. These included archives, temple and domestic, from the Early Dynastic and Sargonic periods, the Ur III period, Old and Middle Babylonian period, and the Neo-Babylonian and Persian periods. Many literary and religious texts were also recovered.\nThe discoveries at the site reached the headlines in mainstream media in the world with the discoveries of the Royal Tombs. As a result, the ruins of the ancient city attracted many visitors. One of these visitors was the already famous Agatha Christie, who as a result of this visit ended up marrying Max Mallowan. During this time the site was accessible from the Baghdad–Basra railway, from a stop called \"Ur Junction\".\nIn 2009, an agreement was reached for a joint University of Pennsylvania and Iraqi team to resume archaeological work at the site of Ur. Excavations began in 2015 under the direction of Elizabeth C Stone and Paul Zimansky of the State University of New York. In part of the section they planned to work (designated AH) they found that a large area had been leveled to build a modern reconstruction of the fictional \"House of Abraham\" and another area have been paved over for a Papal visit. The first excavation season was primarily to re-excavate Woolley's work in an Old Babylonian housing area with two new trenches for confirmation. Among the finds were a cylinder seal and balance pan weights.  A number of cuneiform tablets were unearthed, a few Ur III period, a few from the Isin-Larsa period (including one from Rim-Sîn I year 24), a few Old Babylonian period, and a number of Old Akkadian period. A similar though smaller dig was made in a Neo-Babylonian housing area.\n In the 2017 season an urban area adjacent to Wooleys very large AH area was excavated. The burial vault of a Babylonian general Abisum was found. Abisum is known from year 36 of Hammurabi into the reign of Samsu-iluna. Thirty cuneiform tablets were found around the vault and another 12 inside the tomb itself. A 3rd excavation season was conducted in 2019 (the University of Pennsylvania excavated in 2023 though nothing has yet been published of that work). A notable find was a large cuneiform tablet dated to the 6th year of Ur III ruler Ibbi-Sin on the swap of two large residences between private individuals (Munimah and Gayagama). One home was about 240 square meters and the other 423 square meters which is especially large for a home in that time.\nSome distance south of Area AH in 2017 and 2019 a German team of Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München directed by Adelheid Otto excavated a large home of Sîn-nādā (mid 19th century BC) chief administrator of the Temple of Ningal in the Isin-Larsa period. In levels below the final occupation were found tablets dating to Sin-Eribam and Silli-Adad, rulers of Larsa. They included a new copy of the Lament for Sumer and Ur.\n\nThe Royal Tomb Excavation\nWhen the Royal Tombs at Ur were discovered, their size was unknown. Excavators started digging two trenches in the middle of the desert to see if they could find anything that would allow them to keep digging. They split into two teams – A and team B. Both teams spent the first few months digging a trench and found evidence of burial grounds by collecting small pieces of golden jewelry and pottery. This was called the \"gold trench\". After the first season of digging finished, Woolley returned to England. In Autumn, Woolley returned and started the second season. By the end of the second season, he had uncovered a courtyard surrounded by many rooms. In their third season of digging archaeologists had uncovered their biggest find yet, a building that was believed to have been constructed by order of the king, and a second building thought to be where the high priestess lived. As the fourth and fifth season came to a close, they had discovered so many items that most of their time was now spent recording the objects they found instead of actually digging objects. Items included gold jewelry, clay pots and stones. One of the most significant objects was the Standard of Ur. By the end of their sixth season they had excavated 1850 burial sites and deemed 17 of them to be \"Royal Tombs\". Some clay sealings and cuneiform tablet fragment were found in an underlying layer.\nWoolley finished his work excavating the Royal Tombs in 1934, uncovering a series of burials. Many servants were killed and buried with the royals, who he believed went to their deaths willingly. Computerized tomography scans on some of the surviving skulls have shown signs that they were killed by blows to the head that could be from the spiked end of a copper axe, which showed Woolley's initial theory of mass suicide via poison to be incorrect.\n\nInside Puabi's tomb there was a chest in the middle of the room. Underneath that chest was a hole in the ground that led to what was called the \"King's Grave\": PG-789. It was believed to be the king's grave because it was buried next to the queen. In this grave, there were 63 attendants who were all equipped with copper helmets and swords. It is thought to be his army buried with him. Another large room was uncovered, PG-1237, called the \"Great death pit\". This large room had 74 bodies, 68 of which were women. This was based on artifacts found with the bodies, weapons and whetstones in the case of males and simple, non-gold, jewelry in the case of females. There is some debate about the gender of one body. Two large ram statues were found in PG-1237 which are believed to be the remains of lyres. Several lyres were found just outside the entrance. The bodies were found to have perimortem blunt force injuries which caused their death. They also had skeleton markers for long term manual labor.\nMost of the treasures excavated at Ur are in the British Museum, the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and the Baghdad Museum. At the Penn Museum the exhibition \"Iraq's Ancient Past\", which includes many of the most famous pieces from the Royal Tombs, opened to visitors in late Spring 2011. Previously, the Penn Museum had sent many of its best pieces from Ur on tour in an exhibition called \"Treasures From the Royal Tombs of Ur.\" It traveled to eight American museums, including those in Cleveland, Washington and Dallas, ending the tour at the Detroit Institute of Art in May 2011.\nSamples from two stratigraphic layers in the royal cemetery area, from before the royal burials, have been radiocarbon dated. The ED Ia layer dated to c. 2900 BC and the ED Ic layer to c. 2679 BC.\n\nCurrent status and preservation\nThough some of the areas that were cleared during modern excavations have sanded over again, the Great Ziggurat is fully cleared and stands as the best-preserved and most visible landmark at the site. The famous Royal tombs, also called the Neo-Sumerian Mausolea, located about 250 metres (820 ft) south-east of the Great Ziggurat in the corner of the wall that surrounds the city, are nearly totally cleared. Parts of the tomb area appear to be in need of structural consolidation or stabilization.\nThere are cuneiform (Sumerian writing) on many walls, some entirely covered in script stamped into the mud-bricks. The text is sometimes difficult to read, but it covers most surfaces. Modern graffiti has also found its way to the graves, usually in the form of names made with coloured pens (sometimes they are carved).\nThe Great Ziggurat itself has far more graffiti, mostly lightly carved into the bricks. The graves are completely empty. A small number of the tombs are accessible. Most of them have been cordoned off. The whole site is covered with pottery debris, to the extent that it is virtually impossible to set foot anywhere without stepping on some. Some have colours and paintings on them. Some of the \"mountains\" of broken pottery are debris that has been removed from excavations.\nPottery debris and human remains form many of the walls of the royal tombs area. In May 2009, the United States Army returned the Ur site to the Iraqi authorities, who hope to develop it as a tourist destination.\n\nSince 2009, the non-profit organization Global Heritage Fund (GHF) has been working to protect and preserve Ur against the problems of erosion, neglect, inappropriate restoration, war and conflict. GHF's stated goal for the project is to create an informed and scientifically grounded Master Plan to guide the long-term conservation and management of the site, and to serve as a model for the stewardship of other sites.\nSince 2013, the institution for Development Cooperation of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs DGCS and the SBAH, the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage of the Iraqi Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, have started a cooperation project for \"The Conservation and Maintenance of Archaeological site of UR\". In the framework of this cooperation agreement, the executive plan, with detailed drawings, is in progress for the maintenance of the Dublamah Temple (design concluded, works starting), the Royal Tombs—Mausolea 3rd Dynasty (in progress)—and the Ziqqurat (in progress). The first updated survey in 2013 has produced a new aerial map derived by the flight of a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operated in March 2014. This is the first high-resolution map, derived from more than 100 aerial photograms, with an accuracy of 20 cm or less. A preview of the ortho-photomap of Archaeological Site of Ur is available online.\n\nTell Sakhariya\nThe site (30º 58’ 33.84” N by 46º 08’ 28.36” E) was first noted, as Tell Abu Ba’arura Shimal (\"Father of Sheep Droppings, North\"), as a Kassite period occupation (300 NE X 150 X 2.5. Cassite: 3.5 ha) during an archaeological survey of the region in the 1960s. The site, which lies 6.45 kilometers northeast of Ur, was excavated in a five week season from December to January 2011 – 2012 by a joint Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage and the State University of New York at Stony Brook team led by Elizabeth Stone and Paul Zimansky. It was measured at about 250 meters by 200 meters with two high points, about 3.5 meters above the plain, separated by a saddle. Seven trenches were dug, some small, and three yielded simple slope wash. On the surface were found Kassite and Old Babylonian period ceramics and satellite imagery suggested the presence of a large square building and a number of other walls but the excavators found no building remains in surface or magnetic gradiometry surveys, or in the later trenches. Three occupational levels were determined. The top layer contained Kassite pottery fragments, a late Kassite kiln, and a number of late Kassite burials. The second held Sealand Dynasty ceramics along with lithic (grinding stones, cuboids and one balance weight), metal, floral and faunal (primarily cattle, sheep, and goats) remains. The excavators deemed the occupations to be repeated but transient. Neither level showed signs of formal or residential architecture.\nThe final, earliest level also lacked notable architecture but featured a very large mud or clay platform, made from clean material, devoid of sherds, bones, or other living debris. Coring to a depth of 4 meters (1 meter below the plain) failed to find the bottom of the platform. Part of the platform is underlain by a square baked brick pavement and remains of a fish pond were found. Two 5 meter by 10 meter trenches, 55 meters apart, were excavated in this platform. An inscribed brick of the first Ur III ruler Ur-Nammu (c. 2112-2094 BC) \"describing the construction of a barag - a pedestal or podium and a garden\" was found out of context. Also found were four fragmentary inscribed bricks (surface finds), three inscribed cones (one datable to Larsa ruler Rim-Sîn I (c. 1822-1763 BC) year 15), and two Sumerian language cuneiform tablets. One tablet was from the early Kassite period and the other tablet was a receipt for copper utensils is dated to year 28 of Ur III ruler Shulgi (c. 2094-2046  BC). After this\nexcavation season a nearby prison was expanded by the Iraqi government blocking access to the site and precluding further campaigns. It has been proposed as the site of Ur III Ga’eš. The ziggurat at Ur can be seen from the summit of the site.\n\nGa’eš\nBased on the archaeology the site of Tell Sakhariya has been proposed as the Ur III period city of Ga’eš (ga-eški and ga-eš5ki), site of the Akiti festival of Nanna/Sin, held every year for 11 days in the seventh month of the year and 7 days in the first month of the year. The festival began at Nanna’s temple in Ur and ended in Ga’eš, possibly traveling via a canal. The temple of Nanna/Sin there was called the Karzida (kar-zi-da) was located at Ga’eš (the names Karzida and Ga’eš appear to have been used interchangeably for the city). The 36th year name  of Ur III ruler Shulgi read \"Year Nanna of Ga’eš was brought into his temple\" and the 9th year name of Ur III ruler Amar-Sin read \"Year En-Nanna-Amar-Sin-kiagra, was installed for the third time as en-priestess of Nanna of Ga’eš / of Karzida\". Amar-Sin established a Giparu (nunnery) for the en-priestess of Nanna at Karzida saying \"he caused En-aga-zi-ana, his  beloved  priestess (en),  to enter there\". When the en-priestess died she was buried a with \"golden crown (aga), which  is followed by five other golden objects\". From tablets found at Ur it is known that wrestling competitions were held at Ga’eš reading \"for the ‘house of wrestling’ in the Akiti (building), issued in Ga’eš, during the Akiti month\" and \"100 liters of ordinary beer, the beer for the ‘house of wrestling’ … issued in Ga’eš\", for example. All that is known with certainty about its location is that it lay one day's journey from Ur and was on a canal. A sketch in a 1990's paper concerning the Iturungal canal placed Ga’eš in a location corresponding to Tell Sakhariya. It has been suggested that Ga’eš was mentioned in Early Dynastic II period administrative texts. The final textual mention of was from the time of Larsa ruler Sin-Iddinam (c. 1849-1843 BC) a cone reading \"Sm-i[ddinam], mighty man, [s]on [born] in Ga’eš  provider  of U[r], king of Lars[a], king of the land of S[umer] and Akkad] ...\". Apparently Ga’eš had a gate tower based on a text from Drehem \"1 fattened sheep for the great gate tower in Ga’eš\" dating to the reign of Su-Sin.\nOne of the Temple Hymns of Enheduanna, the daughter of Sargon of Akkad (c. 2334-2279 BC), is dedicated to Ga’eš and the Karzida temple of Nanna/Sin there.\n\n\"Shrine, great sanctuary?, founded at a cattle-pen, ‘Small’ city, . . . . of  Suen Karzida, your interior is a . . . . place, your foundation is holy and clean, Shrine, your Gipar is founded in purity, Your door is (of) strong copper, set up at a great place, Cattle-pen (filled with) the lowing (of  the cows), like a young bull you . . . the horn,Your prince, the lord of  heaven, standing in the . . . ., At noon (like the sun) radiating . .  . ., O Karzida, he, Ašimbabbar, has placed the house upon your . . . . has taken his place on your dais. The house of Nanna in Ga’eš\"\nGa’eš was also mentioned in the Sumerian literary composition Lament for Sumer and Ur\n\n\"... Mighty strength was set against the banks of the Id-nuna-Nanna canal. The settlements of the E-danna of Nanna, like substantial cattle-pens, were destroyed. Their refugees, like stampeding goats, were chased (?) by dogs. They destroyed Gaeš like milk poured out to dogs,  and shattered its finely fashioned statues. 'Alas, the destroyed city, my destroyed house,' Its sacred Ĝipar of en priesthood was defiled. Its en priestess was snatched from the Ĝipar and carried off to enemy territory. A lament was raised at the dais that stretches out toward heaven. Its heavenly throne was not set up, was not fit to be crowned (?).\"\nAnd in another composition:\n\n\"O, sanctuary, big chamber built like ? a stall, mighty beaming city of Suen, Karzida, your interior is a powerful place, your foundation is holy and clean. O, sanctuary, your Ĝipar is established in purity, your door is copper, something (very) strong, established in the Underworld. O, cattle-pen, which rai[ses] the horns like a breeding bull, your prince, the lord of heaven standing in ... joy. ... at midday and ...

The once supposed second dynasty of Ur may have never existed. The first dynasty of Ur may have been preceded by one other dynasty of Ur (the \"Kalam dynasty\") unnamed on the SKL—which had extensive influence over the area of Sumer and apparently led a union of south Mesopotamian polities. This predynastic period of Ur may include at least two rulers out of the first eight on this list (Meskalamdug and Akalamdug). The following list should not be considered complete:\n\nSee also\nCorrespondence of the Kings of Ur\nHistory of Iraq\nHistory of Sumer\nList of cities of the ancient Near East\nLyres of Ur\nRam in a Thicket\nRoyal Game of Ur\nShort chronology\nTal Abu Tbeirah\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n[17] Benati, Giacomo, \"Re-modeling political economy in early 3rd millennium BC Mesopotamia: patterns of socio-economic organization in Archaic Ur (Tell al-Muqayyar, Iraq)\", Cuneiform Digital Library Journal 2015.2, 2015\nBenati, Giacomo, \"The Beginning of the Early Dynastic Period at Ur\", Iraq, vol. 76, 2014, pp. 1–17, 2014\nBlack, J. and Spada, G., \"Texts from Ur: Kept in the Iraq Museum and the British Museum.\", Nisaba 19, Messina: Dipartimento di Scienze dell’Antichitá 2008 ISBN 9788882680107\n[18] Chambon, Grégory \"Archaic metrological systems from Ur\", Cuneiform Digital Library Journal 2003.5, 2003\nD.

          "summary": "Ur ( or ) was a major Sumerian city-state in ancient Mesopotamia, located at the site of modern Tell el-Muqayyar (Arabic: تَلّ ٱلْمُقَيَّر, lit. 'mound of bitumen') in Dhi Qar Governorate, southern Iraq. Although Ur was a coastal city near the mouth of the Euphrates on the Persian Gulf, the coastline has shifted and the site is now well inland, on the south bank of the Euphrates, 16 km (10 mi) southwest of  Nasiriyah in modern-day Iraq. The city dates from the Ubaid period c. 3800 BC, and is recorded in written history as a city-state from the 26th century BC, its first recorded king being Mesannepada.\nThe city's patron deity was the moon god Nanna (Sin in Akkadian), and the name of the city is derived from UNUGKI, literally \"the abode (of Nanna)\". The site is marked by the partially restored ruins of the Ziggurat of Ur, which contained the shrine of Nanna, excavated in the 1930s. The temple was built in the 21st century BC (short chronology), during the reign of Ur-Nammu and was reconstructed in the 6th century BC by Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon.",

The structure was built during the Early Bronze Age (21st century BC) by King Ur-Nammu of the Third Dynasty of Ur. It had crumbled to ruins by the 6th century BC of the Neo-Babylonian period, when it was restored by King Nabonidus.\nIts remains were excavated in the 1920s and 1930s by international teams led by Sir Leonard Woolley. Under Saddam Hussein in the 1980s, they were encased by a partial reconstruction of the façade and the monumental staircase. The Ziggurat of Ur is the best-preserved of those known from Mesopotamia, besides the ziggurat of Dur Untash (Chogha Zanbil). It is one of three well-preserved structures of the Neo-Sumerian city of Ur, along with the Royal Mausolea and the Palace of Ur-Nammu (the E-hursag).\n\nSumerian ziggurat\nThe ziggurat was built by King Ur-Nammu, who dedicated it in honour of Nanna/Sîn in approximately the 21st century BC (short chronology) during the Third Dynasty of Ur. The massive step pyramid measured 64 m (210 ft) in length, 45 m (148 ft) in width and over 30 m (98 ft) in height. The height is speculative, as only the foundations of the Sumerian ziggurat have survived.\nThe ziggurat was a piece in a temple complex that served as an administrative center for the city, and which was a shrine of the moon god Nanna, the patron deity of Ur.\nThe construction of the ziggurat was finished in the 21st century BC by King Shulgi, who, in order to win the allegiance of cities, proclaimed himself a god. During his 48-year reign, the city of Ur grew to be the capital of a state controlling much of Mesopotamia.\n\nNeo-Babylonian restoration\nKing Nabonidus, the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in the 6th century BC, after \"finding little left but the last stage and nothing to guide him as to the monument's original appearance\", had it restored in seven stages rather than three.\n\nExcavation and preservation\nThe remains of the ziggurat were rediscovered by William Loftus in 1850. The first excavations at the site were conducted by John Taylor (mistakenly credited as \"J. E. Taylor\") in the 1850s, leading to the identification of the site as Ur.\nAfter World War I, preliminary excavations were performed by Reginald Thompson and Henry Hall. The site was extensively excavated in the 1920s by Sir Leonard Woolley by appointment of the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania and the British Museum in the period of 1922 to 1934.\nThe remains of the ziggurat consist of a three-layered solid mass of  mud brick faced with burnt bricks set in bitumen. The lowest layer corresponds to the original construction of Ur-Nammu, while the two upper layers are part of the Neo-Babylonian restorations. The façade of the lowest level and the monumental staircase were rebuilt under the orders of Saddam Hussein.\nThe rebuilt ziggurat was damaged in the Gulf War in 1991 by small arms fire, and the structure was shaken by explosions. Four bomb craters can be seen nearby, and the walls of the ziggurat are marred by over 400 bullet holes.\n\nAs of 2008, the site was under the supervision of curator Dief Mohssein Naiif al-Gizzy.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nAbraham\nNasiriyah Airport\nAbraham and the temple in Islamic tradition\nEnnigaldi-Nanna's museum\nArchitecture of Mesopotamia\nUr of the Chaldees\nZiggurat of Aqar Quf\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nWoolley, C.

          "content": "Uruk, the archeological site known today as Warka, was an ancient city in the Near East or West Asia, located east of the current bed of the Euphrates River, on an ancient, now-dried channel of the river in Muthanna Governorate, Iraq. The site lies 93 kilometers (58 miles) northwest of ancient Ur, 108 kilometers (67 miles) southeast of ancient Nippur, and 24 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of ancient Larsa. It is 30 km (19 mi) east of modern Samawah.\nUruk is the type site for the Uruk period. Uruk played a leading role in the early urbanization of Sumer in the mid-4th millennium BC.\nBy the final phase of the Uruk period around 3100 BC, the city may have had 40,000 residents, with 80,000–90,000 people living in its environs, making it the largest urban area in the world at the time. Gilgamesh, according to the chronology presented in the Sumerian King List (SKL), ruled Uruk in the 27th century BC. After the end of the Early Dynastic period, with the rise of the Akkadian Empire, the city lost its prime importance. It had periods of florescence during the Isin-Larsa period, Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods and throughout the Achaemenid (550–330 BC), Seleucid (312–63 BC) and Parthian (227 BC to AD 224) periods, until it was finally abandoned shortly before or after the Islamic conquest of 633–638.\nWilliam Kennett Loftus visited the site of Uruk in 1849, identifying it as \"Erech\", known as \"the second city of Nimrod\", and led the first excavations from 1850 to 1854. In myth and literature, Uruk was famous as the capital city of Gilgamesh, hero of the Epic of Gilgamesh. Biblical scholars identify Uruk as the biblical Erech (Genesis 10:10), the second city founded by Nimrod in Shinar.\n\nToponymy\nUruk () has several spellings in cuneiform; in Sumerian it is 𒀕𒆠 unugᵏⁱ; in Akkadian, 𒌷𒀕 or 𒌷𒀔 Uruk (URUUNUG). Its names in other languages include: Arabic: وركاء or أوروك, Warkāʾ or Auruk; Classical Syriac: ܐܘܿܪܘܿܟ, ʾÚrūk; Biblical Hebrew: אֶרֶךְ‎ ʾÉreḵ; Ancient Greek: Ὀρχόη, romanized: Orkhóē, Ὀρέχ Orékh, Ὠρύγεια Ōrúgeia.\n\nHistory\nAccording to the SKL, Uruk was founded by the king Enmerkar. Though the king-list mentions a father before him, the epic Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta relates that Enmerkar constructed the House of Heaven (Sumerian: e₂-anna; cuneiform: 𒂍𒀭 E₂.AN) for the goddess Inanna in the Eanna District of Uruk. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh builds the city wall around Uruk and is king of the city.\nUruk went through several phases of growth, from the Early Uruk period (4000–3500 BC) to the Late Uruk period (3500–3100 BC). The city was formed when two smaller Ubaid settlements developed into the cities of Unug and Kullaba and later merged to become Uruk. The temple complexes at their cores became the Eanna District (Unug) dedicated to Inanna and the \"Anu\" District of Kullaba.\nThe Eanna District was composed of several buildings with spaces for workshops, and it was walled off from the city. By contrast, the Anu District was built on a terrace with a temple at the top. It is clear Eanna was dedicated to Inanna from the earliest Uruk period throughout the history of the city. The rest of the city was composed of typical courtyard houses, grouped by profession of the occupants, in districts around Eanna and Anu. Uruk was extremely well penetrated by a canal system that has been described as \"Venice in the desert\". This canal system flowed throughout the city connecting it with the maritime trade on the ancient Euphrates River as well as the surrounding agricultural belt.\nThe original city of Uruk was situated southwest of the ancient Euphrates River, now dry. Currently, the site of Warka is northeast of the modern Euphrates river. The change in position was caused by a shift in the Euphrates at some point in history, which, together with salination due to irrigation, may have contributed to the decline of Uruk.\n\nUruk period\nIn addition to being one of the first cities, Uruk was the main force of urbanization and state formation during the Uruk period, or 'Uruk expansion' (4000–3200 BC). This period of 800 years saw a shift from small, agricultural villages to a larger urban center with a full-time bureaucracy, military, and stratified society. Although other settlements coexisted with Uruk, they were generally about 10 hectares while Uruk was significantly larger and more complex. The Uruk period culture exported by Sumerian traders and colonists had an effect on all surrounding peoples, who gradually evolved their own comparable, competing economies and cultures. Ultimately, Uruk could not maintain long-distance control over colonies such as Tell Brak by military force.\n\nEarly Dynastic, Akkadian, Ur III, and Old Babylonian period\nDynastic categorizations are described solely from the Sumerian King List, which is of problematic historical accuracy; the organization might be analogous to Manetho's.\nIn 2009, two different copies of an inscription were put forth as evidence of a 19th-century BC ruler of Uruk named Naram-sin.\nUruk continued as principality of Ur, Babylon, and later Achaemenid, Seleucid, and Parthian Empires. It enjoyed brief periods of independence during the Isin-Larsa period, under kings such as (possibly Ikūn-pî-Ištar, Sumu-binasa, Alila-hadum, and Naram-Sin), Sîn-kāšid, his son Sîn-irībam, his son Sîn-gāmil, Ilum-gāmil, brother of Sîn-gāmil, Etēia, AN-am3 (Dingiram), ÌR3-ne-ne (Irdanene), who was defeated by Rīm-Sîn I of Larsa in his year 14 (c. 1740 BC), Rîm-Anum and Nabi-ilīšu.\nIt is known that during the time of Ilum-gāmil a temple was built for the god Iškur (Hadad) based on a clay cone inscription reading \"For the god Iškur, lord, fearsome splendour of heaven and  earth, his lord, for the life of Ilum-gāmil, king of Uruk, son of Sîn-irībam, Ubar-Adad, his  servant, son of Apil-Kubi, built the Esaggianidu, ('House  — whose closing is good'), the residence of his office of en, and thereby  made  it truly befitting his own li[fe]\".\n\nUruk into Late Antiquity\nAlthough it had been a thriving city in Early Dynastic Sumer, especially Early Dynastic II, Uruk was ultimately annexed by the Akkadian Empire and went into decline. Later, in the Neo-Sumerian period, Uruk enjoyed revival as a major economic and cultural center under the sovereignty of Ur. The Eanna District was restored as part of an ambitious building program, which included a new temple for Inanna. This temple included a ziggurat, the 'House of the Universe' (Cuneiform: E₂.SAR.A) (𒂍𒊬𒀀) to the northeast of the Uruk period Eanna ruins.\nFollowing the collapse of Ur (c. 2000 BC), Uruk went into a steep decline until about 850 BC when the Neo-Assyrian Empire annexed it as a provincial capital. Under the Neo-Assyrians and Neo-Babylonians, Uruk regained much of its former glory. By 250 BC, a new temple complex the 'Head Temple' (Akkadian: Bīt Reš) was added to northeast of the Uruk period Anu district. The Bīt Reš along with the Esagila was one of the two main centers of Neo-Babylonian astronomy. All of the temples and canals were restored again under Nabopolassar. During this era, Uruk was divided into five main districts: the Adad Temple, Royal Orchard, Ištar Gate, Lugalirra Temple, and Šamaš Gate districts.\nUruk, known as Orcha (Ὄρχα) to the Greeks, continued to thrive under the Seleucid Empire. During this period, Uruk was a city of 300 hectares and perhaps 40,000 inhabitants. In 200 BC, the 'Great Sanctuary' (Cuneiform: E₂.IRI₁₂.GAL, Sumerian: eš-gal) of Ishtar was added between the Anu and Eanna districts. The ziggurat of the temple of Anu, which was rebuilt in this period, was the largest ever built in Mesopotamia. When the Seleucids lost Mesopotamia to the Parthians in 141 BC, Uruk continued in use. The decline of Uruk after the Parthians may have been in part caused by a shift in the Euphrates River. By 300 AD, Uruk was mostly abandoned, but a group of Mandaeans settled there, based on some finds of Mandaic incantation bowls, and by c. 700 AD it was completely abandoned.\n\nPolitical history\nUruk played a very important part in the political history of Sumer. Starting from the Early Uruk period, the city exercised hegemony over nearby settlements. At this time (c. 3800 BC), there were two centers of 20 ha (49 acres), Uruk in the south and Nippur in the north surrounded by much smaller 10 ha (25 acres) settlements. Later, in the Late Uruk period, its sphere of influence extended over all Sumer and beyond to external colonies in upper Mesopotamia and Syria.\n\nIn Uruk, in southern Mesopotamia, Sumerian civilization seems to have reached its creative peak. This is pointed out repeatedly in the references to this city in religious and, especially, in literary texts, including those of mythological content; the historical tradition as preserved in the Sumerian king-list confirms it. From Uruk the center of political gravity seems to have moved to Ur.\n\nThe recorded chronology of rulers over Uruk includes both mythological and historic figures in five dynasties. As in the rest of Sumer, power moved progressively from the temple to the palace. Rulers from the Early Dynastic period exercised control over Uruk and at times over all of Sumer. In myth, kingship was lowered from heaven to Eridu then passed successively through five cities until the deluge which ended the Uruk period. Afterwards, kingship passed to Kish at the beginning of the Early Dynastic period, which corresponds to the beginning of the Early Bronze Age in Sumer. In the Early Dynastic I period (2900–2800 BC), Uruk was in theory under the control of Kish. This period is sometimes called the Golden Age. During the Early Dynastic II period (2800–2600 BC), Uruk was again the dominant city exercising control of Sumer. This period is the time of the First Dynasty of Uruk sometimes called the Heroic Age. However, by the Early Dynastic IIIa period (2600–2500 BC) Uruk had lost sovereignty, this time to Ur. This period, corresponding to the Early Bronze Age III, is the end of the First Dynasty of Uruk. In the Early Dynastic IIIb period (2500–2334 BC), also called the Pre-Sargonic period (before the rise of the Akkadian Empire under Sargon of Akkad), Uruk continued to be ruled by Ur.\n\nArchitecture\nUruk has some of the first monumental constructions in architectural history, and certainly the largest of its era. Much of Near Eastern architecture can trace its roots to these prototypical buildings. The structures of Uruk are cited by two different naming conventions, one in German from the initial expedition, and the English translation of the same. The stratigraphy of the site is complex and as such much of the dating is disputed. In general, the structures follow the two main typologies of Sumerian architecture, Tripartite with 3 parallel halls and T-Shaped also with three halls, but the central one extends into two perpendicular bays at one end. The following table summarizes the significant architecture of the Eanna and Anu Districts. Temple N, Cone-Mosaic Courtyard, and Round Pillar Hall are often referred to as a single structure; the Cone-Mosaic Temple.\n\nIt is clear Eanna was dedicated to Inanna symbolized by Venus from the Uruk period. At that time, she was worshipped in four aspects as Inanna of the netherworld (Sumerian: ᵈinanna-kur), Inanna of the morning (Sumerian: ᵈinanna-hud₂), Inanna of the evening (Sumerian: ᵈinanna-sig), and Inanna (Sumerian: ᵈinanna-NUN). The names of four temples in Uruk at this time are known, but it is impossible to match them with either a specific structure and in some cases a deity.\n\nsanctuary of Inanna (Sumerian: eš-ᵈinanna)\nsanctuary of Inanna of the evening (Sumerian: eš-ᵈinanna-sig)\ntemple of heaven (Sumerian: e₂-an)\ntemple of heaven and netherworld (Sumerian: e₂-an-ki)\n\nArchaeology\nBy the end of the Uruk period c. 3100 BC) Uruk had reached a size of 250 ha (620 acres). During the following Jemdet Nasr period it grew to a size of 600 ha (1,500 acres) by c. 2800 BC with the main temple area of Eanna being completely rebuilt after leveling the foundations of the Uruk period construction. A new city wall was constructed in this period.\nThe site, which lies about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of ancient Ur, is one of the largest in the region at around 5.5 km2 (2.1 sq mi) in area. The maximum extent is 3 km (1.9 miles) north/south, and 2.5 km (1.6 miles) east/west. There are three major tells within the site: The Eanna district, Bit Resh (Kullaba), and Irigal. Archaeologically, the site is divided into six parts\n\nthe É-Anna ziggurat ' Egipar-imin,\nthe É-Anna enclosure (Zingel),\nthe Anu-Antum temple complex, BitRes and Anu-ziggurat,\nIrigal, the South Building,\nParthian structures including the Gareus-temple, and the Multiple Apse building,\nthe \"Gilgameš\" city-wall with associated Sinkâsid Palace and the Seleucid Bit Akîtu.\n\nThe location of Uruk was first noted by Fraser and Ross in 1835. William Loftus excavated there in 1850 and 1854 after a scouting mission in 1849. By Loftus' own account, he admits that the first excavations were superficial at best, as his financiers forced him to deliver large museum artifacts at a minimal cost. A large basalt stela found by Loftus was later lost. Warka was also scouted by archaeologist Walter Andrae in 1902. In 1905 Warka was visited by archaeologist Edgar James Banks.\n\nFrom 1912 to 1913, Julius Jordan and his team from the German Oriental Society discovered the temple of Ishtar, one of four known temples located at the site. The temples at Uruk were quite remarkable as they were constructed with brick and adorned with colorful mosaics. Jordan also discovered part of the city wall. It was later discovered that this 40-to-50-foot (12 to 15 m) high brick wall, probably utilized as a defense mechanism, totally encompassed the city at a length of 9 km (5.6 mi). Utilizing sedimentary strata dating techniques, this wall is estimated to have been erected around 3000 BC. Jordan produced a contour map of the entire site.\nThe GOS returned to Uruk in 1928 and excavated until 1939, when World War II intervened. The team was led by Jordan until 1931 when Jordan became Director of Antiquities in Baghdad, then by A. Nöldeke, Ernst Heinrich, and H. J. Lenzen. Among the finds was the Stell of the Lion Hunt, excavated in a Jemdat Nadr layer but sylistically dated to Uruk IV.\nThe German excavations resumed after the war and were under the direction of Heinrich Lenzen from 1954 to 1967. He was followed in 1968 by J. Schmidt, and in 1978 by R.M. Boehmer. In total, the German archaeologists spent 39 seasons working at Uruk. The results are documented in two series of reports:\n\nAusgrabungen der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft in Uruk (ADFU), 17 volumes, 1912–2001\nAusgrabungen in Uruk-Warka, Endberichte (AUWE), 25 volumes, 1987–2007\n\nMost recently, from 2001 to 2002, the German Archaeological Institute team led by Margarete van Ess, with Joerg Fassbinder and Helmut Becker, conducted a partial magnetometer survey in Uruk. In addition to the geophysical survey, core samples and aerial photographs were taken. This was followed up with high-resolution satellite imagery in 2005. Work resumed in 2016 and is currently concentrated on the city wall area and a survey of the surrounding landscape. Part of the work has been to create a digital twin of the Uruk archaeological area. The current effort also involves geophysical surveying. The soil characteristics of the site make ground penetrating radar unsuitable so caesium magnetometers, combined with resistivity probes, are being used.\n\nCuneiform tablets\nA number of Proto-cuneiform clay tablets were found at Uruk. About 190 were Uruk V period (c. 3500 BC) \"numerical tablets\" or \"impressed tablets\", 1776 were from the Uruk IV period (c. 3300 BC), 3094 from the Uruk III period (c. 3200–2900 BC) which is also called the Jemdet Nasr period. Later cuneiform tablets were deciphered and include the famous SKL, a record of kings of the Sumerian civilization. There was an even larger cache of legal and scholarly tablets of the Neo-Babylonian, Late Babylonian, and Seleucid period, that have been published by Adam Falkenstein and other Assyriological members of the German Archaeological Institute in Baghdad as Jan J. A. Djik, Hermann Hunger, Antoine Cavigneaux, Egbert von Weiher, and Karlheinz Kessler, or others as Erlend Gehlken. Many of the cuneiform tablets form acquisitions by museums and collections as the British Museum, Yale Babylonian Collection, and the Louvre. The latter holds a unique cuneiform tablet in Aramaic known as the Aramaic Uruk incantation. The last dated cuneiform tablet from Uruk was W22340a, an astronomical almanac, which is dated to 79/80 AD.\nThe oldest known writing to feature a person's name was found in Uruk, in the form of several tablets that mention Kushim, who (assuming they are an individual person) served as an accountant recording transactions made in trading barley – 29,086 measures barley 37 months Kushim.\n\nBeveled rim bowls were the most common type of container used during the Uruk period. They are believed to be vessels for serving rations of food or drink to dependent laborers. The introduction of the fast wheel for throwing pottery was developed during the later part of the Uruk period, and made the mass production of pottery simpler and more standardized.\n\nArtifacts\nThe Mask of Warka, also known as the 'Lady of Uruk' and the 'Sumerian Mona Lisa', dating from 3100 BC, is one of the earliest representations of the human face. The carved marble female face is probably a depiction of Inanna. It is approximately 20 cm (7.9 in) tall, and may have been incorporated into a larger cult image. The mask was looted from the Iraq Museum during the invasion of Iraq in April 2003. It was recovered in September 2003 and returned to the museum.\n\nArchaeological levels of Uruk\nArcheologists have discovered multiple cities of Uruk built atop each other in chronological order.\n\nUruk XVIII Eridu period (c. 5000 BC): the founding of Uruk\nUruk XVIII–XVI Late Ubaid period (4800–4200 BC)\nUruk XVI–X Early Uruk period (4000–3800 BC)\nUruk IX–VI Middle Uruk period (3800–3400 BC)\nUruk V–IV Late Uruk period (3400–3100 BC): the earliest monumental temples of Eanna District are built\nUruk III Jemdet Nasr period (3100–2900 BC): the 9 km city wall is built\nUruk II\nUruk I\n\nAnu District\nThe area traditionally called the Anu district consists of a single massive terrace, the Anu ziggurat, originally proposed to have been dedicated to the Sumerian sky god Anu.\nThe Stone Temple was built of limestone and bitumen on a podium of rammed earth and plastered with lime mortar. The podium itself was built over a woven reed mat called ĝipar, which was ritually used as a nuptial bed. The ĝipar was a source of generative power which then radiated upward into the structure. The structure of the Stone Temple further develops some mythological concepts from Enuma Elish, perhaps involving libation rites as indicated from the channels, tanks, and vessels found there. The structure was ritually destroyed, covered with alternating layers of clay and stone, then excavated and filled with mortar sometime later.\n\nEanna District\nThe Eanna district is historically significant as both writing and monumental public architecture emerged here during Uruk periods VI–IV. The combination of these two developments places Eanna as arguably the first true city and civilization in human history. Eanna during period IVa contains the earliest examples of writing.\nThe first building of Eanna, Stone-Cone Temple (Mosaic Temple), was built in period VI over a preexisting Ubaid temple and is enclosed by a limestone wall with an elaborate system of buttresses. The Stone-Cone Temple, named for the mosaic of colored stone cones driven into the adobe brick façade, may be the earliest water cult in Mesopotamia. It was \"destroyed by force\" in Uruk IVb period and its contents interred in the Riemchen Building.\n\nIn the following period, Uruk V, about 100 m east of the Stone-Cone Temple the Limestone Temple was built on a 2 m high rammed-earth podium over a pre-existing Ubaid temple, which like the Stone-Cone Temple represents a continuation of Ubaid culture. However, the Limestone Temple was unprecedented for its size and use of stone, a clear departure from traditional Ubaid architecture. The stone was quarried from an outcrop at Umayyad about 60 km east of Uruk. It is unclear if the entire temple or just the foundation was built of this limestone. The Limestone Temple is probably the first Inanna temple, but it is impossible to know with certainty. Like the Stone-Cone temple the Limestone temple was also covered in cone mosaics. Both of these temples were rectangles with their corners aligned to the cardinal directions, a central hall flanked along the long axis by two smaller halls, and buttressed façades; the prototype of all future Mesopotamian temple architectural typology.\n\nBetween these two monumental structures a complex of buildings (called A–C, E–K, Riemchen, Cone-Mosaic), courts, and walls was built during Eanna IVb. These buildings were built during a time of great expansion in Uruk as the city grew to 250 ha (620 acres) and established long-distance trade, and are a continuation of architecture from the previous period. The Riemchen Building, named for the 16 cm (6.3 in)×16 cm (6.3 in) brick shape called Riemchen by the Germans, is a memorial with a ritual fire kept burning in the center for the Stone-Cone Temple after it was destroyed. For this reason, Uruk IV period represents a reorientation of belief and culture. The facade of this memorial may have been covered in geometric and figural murals. The Riemchen bricks first used in this temple were used to construct all buildings of Uruk IV period Eanna. The use of colored cones as a façade treatment was greatly developed as well, perhaps used to greatest effect in the Cone-Mosaic Temple. Composed of three parts: Temple N, the Round Pillar Hall, and the Cone-Mosaic Courtyard, this temple was the most monumental structure of Eanna at the time. They were all ritually destroyed and the entire Eanna district was rebuilt in period IVa at an even grander scale.\nDuring Eanna IVa, the Limestone Temple was demolished and the Red Temple built on its foundations. The accumulated debris of the Uruk IVb buildings were formed into a terrace, the L-Shaped Terrace, on which Buildings C, D, M, Great Hall, and Pillar Hall were built. Building E was initially thought to be a palace, but later proven to be a communal building. Also in period IV, the Great Court, a sunken courtyard surrounded by two tiers of benches covered in cone mosaic, was built. A small aqueduct drains into the Great Courtyard, which may have irrigated a garden at one time. The impressive buildings of this period were built as Uruk reached its zenith and expanded to 600 hectares. All the buildings of Eanna IVa were destroyed sometime in Uruk III, for unclear reasons.\nThe architecture of Eanna in period III was very different from what had preceded it. The complex of monumental temples was replaced with baths around the Great Courtyard and the labyrinthine Rammed-Earth Building. This period corresponds to Early Dynastic Sumer c. 2900 BC, a time of great social upheaval when the dominance of Uruk was eclipsed by competing city-states. The fortress-like architecture of this time is a reflection of that turmoil. The temple of Inanna continued functioning during this time in a new form and under a new name, 'The House of Inanna in Uruk' (Sumerian: e₂-ᵈinanna unuᵏⁱ-ga). The location of this structure is currently unknown.\n\nList of rulers\nThe Sumerian King List (SKL) lists only 22 rulers among five dynasties of Uruk. The sixth dynasty was an Amorite dynasty not mentioned on the SKL. The following list should not be considered complete:\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\n[2] R. McC. Adams and H.

          "summary": "Uruk, the archeological site known today as Warka, was an ancient city in the Near East or West Asia, located east of the current bed of the Euphrates River, on an ancient, now-dried channel of the river in Muthanna Governorate, Iraq. The site lies 93 kilometers (58 miles) northwest of ancient Ur, 108 kilometers (67 miles) southeast of ancient Nippur, and 24 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of ancient Larsa. It is 30 km (19 mi) east of modern Samawah.\nUruk is the type site for the Uruk period. Uruk played a leading role in the early urbanization of Sumer in the mid-4th millennium BC.\nBy the final phase of the Uruk period around 3100 BC, the city may have had 40,000 residents, with 80,000–90,000 people living in its environs, making it the largest urban area in the world at the time. Gilgamesh, according to the chronology presented in the Sumerian King List (SKL), ruled Uruk in the 27th century BC. After the end of the Early Dynastic period, with the rise of the Akkadian Empire, the city lost its prime importance. It had periods of florescence during the Isin-Larsa period, Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods and throughout the Achaemenid (550–330 BC), Seleucid (312–63 BC) and Parthian (227 BC to AD 224) periods, until it was finally abandoned shortly before or after the Islamic conquest of 633–638.\nWilliam Kennett Loftus visited the site of Uruk in 1849, identifying it as \"Erech\", known as \"the second city of Nimrod\", and led the first excavations from 1850 to 1854. In myth and literature, Uruk was famous as the capital city of Gilgamesh, hero of the Epic of Gilgamesh. Biblical scholars identify Uruk as the biblical Erech (Genesis 10:10), the second city founded by Nimrod in Shinar.",

          "content": "Nippur (Sumerian: Nibru, often logographically recorded as 𒂗𒆤𒆠, EN.LÍLKI, \"Enlil City;\" Akkadian: Nibbur) was an ancient Sumerian city. It was the special seat of the worship of the Sumerian god Enlil, the \"Lord Wind\", ruler of the  cosmos, subject to An alone. Nippur was located in modern Nuffar 8 kilometers north of modern Afak, Al-Qādisiyyah Governorate, Iraq. It is roughly 200 km south of modern Baghdad and about 100 km southeast of the ancient city of Babylon. Occupation at the site extended back to the Ubaid period (Ubaid 2 – Hajji Muhammed), the Uruk period, and the Jemdet Nasr period. The origin of the ancient name is unknown but different proposals have been made.\n\nHistory\nEarly Bronze Age\nEarly Dynastic period\nNippur never enjoyed political hegemony in its own right, but its control was crucial, as it was considered capable of conferring the overall \"kingship\" on monarchs from other city-states. It was distinctively a sacred city, important from the possession of the famous Ekur temple of Enlil. Ninurta, son of Enlil, also had his main cult center, the E-shumesha temple, in the city-state.\nAccording to the Tummal Chronicle, Enmebaragesi, an early ruler of Kish, was the first to build up\nthis temple.\nHis influence over Nippur has also been detected archaeologically. The Chronicle lists successive early Sumerian rulers who kept up intermittent ceremonies at the temple: Aga of Kish, son of Enmebaragesi; Mesannepada of Ur; his son Meskiang-nunna; Gilgamesh of Uruk; his son Ur-Nungal; Nanni of Ur and his son Meskiang-nanna. It also indicates that the practice was revived in the Ur III period by Ur-Nammu of Ur, and continued until Ibbi-Sin appointed Enmegalana high priest in Uruk (c. 1950 BC).\n\nInscriptions of Lugal-Zage-Si and Lugal-kigub-nidudu, kings of Uruk and Ur respectively, and of other early rulers, on door-sockets and stone vases, show the veneration in which the ancient shrine was then held, and the importance attached to its possession, as giving a certain stamp of legitimacy. On their votive offerings, some of these rulers designate themselves as ensis, or governors.\n\nAkkadian period (c. 2350-2150 BCE)\nLate in the 3rd millennium BC, Nippur was conquered and occupied by the rulers of Akkad, or Agade, and numerous votive objects of Sargon, Rimush, and Naram-Sin testify to the veneration in which they also held this sanctuary. Naram-Sin rebuilt both the Ekur temple and the 17.5 meter wide city walls. One of the few instances of Nippur being recorded as having its own ruler comes from a tablet depicting a revolt of several Mesopotamian cities against Naram-Sin, including Nippur under Amar-enlila. The tablet goes on to relate that Naram-Sin defeated these rebel cities in nine battles, and brought them back under his control. The Weidner tablet (ABC 19) suggests that the Akkadian Empire fell as divine retribution, because of Sargon's initiating the transfer of \"holy city\" status from Nippur to Babylon.\nThis Akkadian occupation was succeeded by occupation during the third dynasty of Ur, and the constructions of Ur-Nammu, the great builder of temples, are superimposed immediately upon those of Naram-Sin. Ur-Nammu gave the temple its final characteristic form. Partly razing the constructions of his predecessors, he erected a terrace of bricks, some 12 m high, covering a space of about 32,000 m2. Near the northwestern edge, towards the western corner, he built a ziggurat of three stages of dry brick, faced with kiln-fired bricks laid in bitumen. On the summit stood, as at Ur and Eridu, a small chamber, the special shrine or abode of the god. Access to the stages of the ziggurat, from the court beneath, was by an inclined plane on the south-east side. To the north-east of the ziggurat stood, apparently, the House of Bel, and in the courts below the ziggurat stood various other buildings, shrines, treasure chambers, and the like. The whole structure was oriented with the corners toward the cardinal points of the compass.\n\nUr III period (c. 2112-2004 BC)\nUr-Nammu also rebuilt the walls of the city on the line of Naram-Sin's walls. The restoration of the general features of the temple of this, and the immediately succeeding periods, has been greatly facilitated by the discovery of a sketch map on a fragment of a clay tablet. This sketch map represents a quarter of the city to the east of the Shatt-en-Nil canal. This quarter was enclosed within its own walls, a city within a city, forming an irregular square, with sides roughly 820 m long, separated from the other quarters, and from the country to the north and east, by canals on all sides, with broad quays along the walls. A smaller canal divided this quarter of the city itself into two parts. In the south-eastern part, in the middle of its southeast side, stood the temple, while in the northwest part, along the Shatt-en-Nil, two great storehouses are indicated. The temple proper, according to this plan, consisted of an outer and inner court, each covering approximately 8 acres (32,000 m2), surrounded by double walls, with a ziggurat on the north-western edge of the latter.\nUr III ruler Shu-Sin, after destroying Šimānum, as noted in a year name, settled the prisoners of that war near Nippur he founded called Šimānum (sometimes called E-Šu-Suen). This practice for disposition of prisoners continued into the first millennium.\n\nMiddle Bronze Age\nIsin/Larsa period (c. 2020-1820 BC)\nThe temple continued to be built upon or rebuilt by kings of various succeeding dynasties, as shown by bricks and votive objects bearing the inscriptions of the kings of various dynasties of Ur and Isin. It seems to have suffered severely in some manner at or about the time the Elamites invaded, as shown by broken fragments of statuary, votive vases, and the like, from that period. Rim-Sin I, the king of Larsa, styles himself \"shepherd of the land of Nippur\".\n\nOld Babylonian period (1820-1587 BCE)\nWith the establishment of the Babylonian empire, under Hammurabi (r. 1792-1750 BC), early in the 2nd millennium BC, the religious, as well as the political center of influence, was transferred to Babylon, Marduk became lord of the pantheon, many of Enlil's attributes were transferred to him, and Ekur, Enlil's temple, was to some extent neglected.\nThe city was taken by Ilī-ma-ilu, the first ruler of the First Sealand dynasty in about the 29th year of the reign of Samsu-iluna, ruler of Babylon. It was retaken by Abī-ešuḫ by his 5th year, after he damned the Tigris river.\n\nLate Bronze Age\nThe Late Bronze Age was from around 1600/1550 to 1200/1150 BCE. In 1587 BCE, the Fall of the Old Babylonian Kingdom came after Mursili I of Hatti raided Babylon in an event known as the \"Sack of Babylon\".\n\nKassite period\nUnder the succeeding Kassite dynasty, shortly after the middle of the 2nd millennium, Ekur was restored once more to its former splendor, several monarchs of that dynasty built upon and adorned it, and thousands of inscriptions, dating from the time of those rulers, have been discovered in its archives. A new temple within Ekur, the Ekurigibarra, was built by Kurigalzu I (c. 1375 BC).\n\nIron Age onwards\nAfter the middle of the 12th century BC follows another long period of comparative neglect due to the river Euphrates changing its course, but with the waters return and the conquest of Babylonia by the Assyrian king Sargon II, at the close of the 8th century BC, we meet again with building inscriptions, and under Ashurbanipal, about the middle of the 7th century BC, we find Ekur restored with a splendour greater than ever before, the ziggurat of that period being 58 by 39 m. After the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire Ekur appears to have gradually fallen into decay, until finally, in the Seleucid period, the ancient temple was turned into a fortress (Ancient Greek: Νιππούρ, Nippoúr). Huge walls were erected at the edges of the ancient terrace, the courts of the temple were filled with houses and streets, and the ziggurat itself was curiously built over in a cruciform shape, and converted into an acropolis for the fortress. This fortress was occupied and further built upon until the close of the Parthian period, about 250 AD; but under the succeeding rule of the Sassanids it in its turn fell into decay.\n\nIslamic abandonment\nNippur remained inhabited in Islamic times, and is mentioned by early Muslim geographers under the name of Niffar. It lay on the Nahr an-Nars canal, believed to have been built by Narses. By the late 800s, though, geographers no longer mentioned it, which indicates that the city had gone into decline by that time. This was part of a broader decline in settlements throughout Iraq, especially in the south, as decaying infrastructure and political violence resulted in large areas being completely abandoned. However, Nippur remained the seat of an Assyrian Church of the East Christian bishopric until the late 900s, when the bishopric was transferred to the city of Nil, further northwest. Nippur itself may have remained occupied even later, since ceramics found among the ruins display underglaze sgraffiato drawings, which were not used much prior to the end of the 10th century. By the time of Yaqut al-Hamawi in the early 1200s, Nippur had been definitively abandoned, although Yaqut still recognized its ruins as the site of a famous place.\nOn the upper surface of these mounds was found a considerable Jewish town, dating from about the beginning of the Arabic period onward to the 10th century AD, in the houses of which were large numbers of Aramaic incantation bowls. Jewish names, appearing in the Persian documents discovered at Nippur, show, however, that Jewish settlement at that city dates in fact from a much earlier period.\n\nArchaeology\nNippur was situated on both sides of the ancient bed of the Shatt-en-Nil canal, one of the earliest courses of the Euphrates, between the present bed of that river and the Tigris, almost 160 km southeast of Baghdad. The canal bed divides the site into an East Mound and West Mound. It is represented by the great complex of ruin mounds known to the Arabs as Nuffar, written by the earlier explorers Niffer, divided into two main parts by the dry bed of the old Shatt-en-Nil (Arakhat). The highest point of these ruins, a conical hill rising about 30 m above the level of the surrounding plain, northeast of the canal bed, is called by the Arabs Bint el-Amiror \"prince's daughter\". The site reached a maximum extent of 130 hectares, this occurring in the Ur III period and again in the Kassite period.\nNippur was first excavated, briefly, by Sir Austen Henry Layard in 1851. Full-scale digging was begun by an expedition from the University of Pennsylvania. The work involved four seasons of excavation between 1889 and 1900 and was led by John Punnett Peters, John Henry Haynes, and Hermann Volrath Hilprecht. Thousands of tablets were found at a smaller mound dubbed \"tablet hill\", about 7.5 meters in average height and 52 square meters in area, southeast of the temple mound. A true arch, one of the world's earliest examples, was also found. In the Parthian layer a box containing fragments of votive axes made of glass from the Kassite period were found. Several late Kassite rulers are represented including Kurigalzu II.\nNippur was excavated for 19 seasons between 1948 and 1990 by a team from the Oriental Institute of Chicago, joined at times by the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and the American Schools of Oriental Research. Part of the effort involved removing large archaeological dumps from the University of Pennsylvania excavations. In the process Early Dynastic bowls, cuneiform tablets, and brick stamps were found. At the temples of Inanna and at Ekur foundation deposits were found with statues of Shulgi and Ur-Nammu. A temple of Inanna, begun in the Early Dynastic period was completely excavated. Subsequent superimposed new iterations of the temple extended all the way up to Parthian times.  Finds included a tablet dated to the 4th year of the Kassite king Shagarakti-Shuriash, one dated to the 44th year of Ur III king Shulgi, and an Indus Valley stamp seal. In 1977 they briefly excavated at the nearby site of Umm al-Hafriyat which was in the process of being heavily looted. Sargonic period tablets found there suggest the ancient name of that site was as Maškan-Ili-Akkade (maš-gánki-ni-dingir-a-ga-dèki). The excavation is now in the process of being published.\nPreliminary efforts to restart work at Nippur began in 2018 under McGuire Gibson. Excavation work at Nippur began in April 2019 under Abbas Alizadeh. Initial focus at Nippur was on a major Parthian period building and a small Late Sassanian house. Permission has also been granted to dig at Dlehim and Drehem. Excavation began in November 2022 for the 21st season which lasted two months. Work began at nearby Drehem but ceased after authorities decided that a police station must first be established there to prevent looting. Work then returned to the Parthian building.\n\nZiggurat\nExtensive excavation details have been recorded for the Ziggurat of Ur-Gur. Overall, the ziggurat site is 25 meters in height, has a rectangular base of 39 meters by 58 meters, consisting three stages of dry brick, and faced with kiln-fired bricks laid in bitumen. The northern corner of the ziggurat points to 12 degrees east of the magnetic north. Construction structure and materials are homogeneous, of small unbaked bricks, laid in different ways: first layer of bricks is on the edge sides with the flat sides out, second layer on the edge sides with the ends out, third layer on the flat sides with the edges out.\nThe ziggurat contains a water conduit system. From the upper surface of the ziggurat, there is a conduit for water drainage in the middle of three façades. Built by baked bricks 1 metre in breadth and 3 meters in depth, around the conduit base is a plaster of bitumen, sloping outward with gutters to carry off water.\nPavements extend from the ziggurat in a cruciform shape with square-like large bricks, in which pieces of pottery are used to fasten the clay together. They extend 2.4 meters below the ziggurat foundation and 12 meters away, connected to the lowest stage of the ziggurat, which protects the ziggurat foundation from rain.\n\nTemple of Enlil\nThe Temple of Enlil situated northeast of the ziggurat was excavated. Topography of the Temple of Enlil was yielded. By stratigraphic excavation, the chronological sequence of the temple could be constructed. The temple dated to Ur III period was constructed by Urnammu, restored and rebuilt by kings ruled Nippur for centuries.\nAs the Temple of Enlil was rebuilt after Ur III, the architectural information provided was based on remains from the Ur III period. The rectangular temple measured about 45×21 m with one entrance on the northeast wall and one entrance on the southwest wall. Floors were paved with baked-brick square bricks with size of 37 cm. 2 substructures built beneath the paved floor with 1.3 m elevation. Walls that the thickness varied from 3.35 to 3.95 m were constructed with straw-tempered unbaked bricks and mud mortar. There was no indication for windows walls above floor level were not preserved but windows were required for additional lighting in the Temple of Enlil. The possible height of the walls was 13.2 m as it was three times of the substructure which is 4.40 m. Although no remains of the roof left, purlins and reeds were covered first and then rammed earth mixed with straw was layered.\nFrom the floor plan of the Temple of Enlil in Ur III period, 2 cellae each connected with 2 minor chambers with wider doorways (2.40 m, 1.45 m for normal doorway) and 2 subsidiary chambers were presented. The burning evidence in the cella (room 13) and the minor chambers (room 16,17) adjacent to the other cella (room 18), the inscription of the Temple of Enlil around Ur III period; both indicated the purpose of the Temple of Enlil was to feed gods on the adjacent ziggurat, as 'kitchen temple', so food preparation could be taken place. Other than that, the Temple of Enlil shown no place of a dais for enthroned deities. Thus, the Temple of Enlil was not for worshiping. Yet, religious ritual related to divine repast perhaps libation, could serve as the purpose of Temple of Enlil during Ur III period.\n\nTemple of Gula\nIn 1990 Oriental Institute excavators identified a building in area WA as the Temple of Gula, a goddess of healing and consort of Ninurta. The earliest identified construction of the temple was in the Isin-Larsa period, with major rebuilds in the Kassite, Neo-Assyrian, and Neo-Babylonian periods. It is thought that the missing temple of Ninurta is nearby.\n\nMurashu archive\nAlmost directly opposite the temple, a large palace was excavated, apparently of the Seleucid period, and in this neighborhood and further southward on these mounds large numbers of inscribed tablets of various periods, including temple archives of the Kassite and commercial archives of the Achaemenid Empire, were excavated. The latter, the \"books and papers\" of the house of Murashu, commercial agents of the government, throw light on the condition of the city and the administration of the country in the Achaemenid period. The tablets date between 454 BC and 404 BC with the majority between 440 BC and 414 BC. The archive is reflective of a diverse populace as one-third of contracts depict non-Babylonian names. Enduring for at least three successive generations, the house of Murashu capitalized on the enterprise of renting substantial plots of farmland having been awarded to occupying Persian governors, nobility, soldiery, probably at discounted rates, whose owners were most likely satisfied with a moderate return. The business would then subdivide these into smaller plots for cultivation by indigenous farmers and recent foreign settlers for a lucrative fee. The house of Murashu leased land, subdivided it, then subleased or rented out the smaller parcels, thereby simply acting as an intermediary. It thereby profited both from the collected rents and percentage of amassed credit reflective of that year's future crop harvests after supplying needed farming implements, means of irrigation, and paying taxes. In 423/422 BC, the house of Murashu took in \"about 20,000 kg or 20,000 shekels of silver\". \"The activities of the house of Murashu had a ruinous effect upon the economy of the country and thus led to the bankruptcy of the landowners. Although the house of Murashu loaned money to the landowners initially, after a few decades it began more and more to take the landowners' place, and the land began to concentrate in its hands.\"\n\nSite TA\nSite TA is a 20 m × 40 m area located in Tablet Hill in Nippur. It is built in between 1948 and 1952 and was partially abandoned due to economic crisis in 1739 B.C. and fully vacated in 1720 B.C. It served as a small community with residential buildings and some minor public infrastructures at that time. TA is full of small size, irregular buildings which create a community as a whole. Houses found in TA are generally one-storey which is a common feature at that period of time. Only three of the houses have a stair to the upper level but it is not considered a two-storey but rooftop level.\nThere are total of 1.591 tablets found in site TA. Regarding the texts type found in tablets are divided into two main categories, private documents and educational material, TA is viewed as a residential area. Most of the houses in TA are residential housing while only one of the houses (House F) are viewed as scribal school, this conclusion is made due to the significant amount of 1,407 tablets are found in House F. Moreover, organic materials were found in some of the houses, therefore, there might be animal husbandry. Moreover, due to the contents of tablets, it is believed that TA is owned by small private owner.\n\nInanna Temple\nInanna (Inanna of Duranki) temple is a historical hallmark of Mesopotamia. Though the temple was a religious element in the dynasty of Ur, there were a lot of political and social issues associated with the temple. The excavations that led to the discovery of the remains of the temple of Nippur were conducted by Donald McCown in 1952. The temple was then excavated between 1954 and 1958, reaching the Early Dynastic II period level. In 1960-1961 the Early Dynastic I (with a large building on same plan) and then Jemdat Nasr and Uruk Period (private houses) levels were reached. Finds included a macehead of Naram-Sin, ruler of the Akkadian Empire, indicating he had rebuilt the temple. During the excavation, the team inadvertently experienced difficulty progressing with their work. The excavators reached a surface that appeared like a baked brick pavement. Notably, this incident drew a lot of interest in the team, and with further progress, they reached what seemed to be a room. Further into their excavation, they discovered a room with inscriptions, suggesting that the building was a temple built by Sulgi, the second king of the third dynasty of Ur. However, the architectural plan of the temple is further demonstrated by the layers of the building.   During the excavation, it was noted that the building had twenty-three-level layers. The excavators revealed that each of the twenty-three layers serves a different purpose. For instance, levels VIII-VII were associated with sculptures and idols used in the temple's religious activities. On the temple's exterior, the excavators found that it was characterised by niches that supported the religious activities at the temple. The niches had special tablets inscipted with literature regarding the teachings at the temple. The Inanna temple had significant political influence in the Ur dynasty. It was built, supported by Sulgi and many subsequent kings, using it as a pedestal to manage the leadership of the dynasty. The temple had specific administrative units that were answerable to the reigning king of the dynasty. This could be attributed to the fact that the leading goddess of the temple, Inanna, was associated with power. Kings believed that the Inanna goddess has the power to influence political issues, which explained the temple's importance and long-lasting popularity throughout the dynasties.\n\nNearby sites\nDrehem\nDrehem or ancient Puzrish-Dagan, sometimes called a suburb of Nippur, is the best-known city of the so-called redistribution centers of the Ur III period. It is located some ten kilometers south of Nippur. Witnessed by thousands of cuneiform tablets, livestock (cattle, sheep, and goats) of the state was centralized at Drehem and redistributed to the temples, its officials and the royal palaces of Sumer. The temples of nearby Nippur were the main destinations of the livestock. The city was founded by Shulgi, king of Ur. Some of its cuneiform archives are at the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto.\n\nTell Dlehim\nThe nearby site of Dlehim (Dulaihim, Delehem, Dlehem, Dlihim) is about 40 hectares in area, separated in eastern and western sections by an ancient 50 meter wide canal bed, and currently described as being 2.5 meters in height. It lies about 21 kilometers south of Nippur and about ten kilometers south of Drehem. The site was visited by John Punnett Peters in 1889 and (believing it was Drehem) by Edgar James Banks in 1903. It was first examined (along with Drehem) in 1925 by Raymond P. Dougherty on behalf of the American Schools of Oriental Research. The mound at the time rose to 25 feet above the plain and was fairly unremarkable with some baked bricks and flint saw-blades. In the 1970s the site was examined as part of an Oriental Institute regional survey. The site was described as being 700 meters by 630 meters and rising to a height of 18 meters in the west-southwest and that \"poor drainage and high soil salinity make collecting conditions generally poor\". Pottery shards showed that primary occupation was in the Early Uruk and Jemdet Nasr periods with\noccupation continuing in the Akkadian Empire, Ur III and Isin-Larsa periods.\nIn modern times it was surveyed by H. Fujii of the Kokushikan University of Tokyo in 1988. In the early days of archaeology it was often confused with the nearby Drehem. It covers an area of 36 hectares and was occupied in the Ur III period. The site has been suggested as the location of ancient Tummal (thought to be the source of the Tummal Inscription). Tummal played a primary political role in the Ur III period. In 2016 the QADIS survey project, carried out an aerial and surface survey of the site. Four bricks (three re-used for a later drain and one in a temple area) of Ur III ruler Amar-Sin were found at the site. Extended traces of Ur III period buildings including an oval temple with central terrace were detected by drone flights and surface surveys. The presence of modern military berms were also noted. The Qadis survey, through imagery and sounding, determined that the site had a 150 meter by 80 meter harbor. In 2019 the Oriental Institute of Chicago received permission to excavate at Dlehim and in 2022 preliminary excavation began.\n\nTell Waresh 2\nThe site of Tell Waresh 2 (first called Tell Hindi2 because it is located about 1 kilometer north-west of Tell Hindi, later named after Tūlūl Werrish which lies 3 kilometers to the southwest) lies 12 kilometers northeast of Nippur (UTM 38 S 532261.73 m E, 3561401.12 m N) and was subject to a rescue excavation in 1990 led by Muhammad Yahya Radhi on behalf of the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage. It was one of a number of rescue excavation in response to the digging of the Main Drain Canal project. The site showed outlines of buildings and many artifacts on the surface. Remains were of the Isin-Larsa period and included terracotta plaques, figurines, clay sealings, cylinder seals, and a number of cuneiform tablets, mainly legal documents. The most prominent of the latter were 29 tablets found in a clay jar which contained year names of four rulers of Larsa, Abi-Sare, Sumu-el, Nur-Adad, and Sin-Iddinam (1785 BC to 1778 BC). The same team revisted the site in 2019 as part of larger survey in the area, obtaining georeferenced data. A final report is now in progress.\n\nSee also\nCities of the ancient Near East\nChronology of the ancient Near East\nGarden of the gods (Sumerian paradise)\nLu-diĝira\nDūr-Abī-ešuḫ\n\nNotes\nReferences\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

          "summary": "Nippur (Sumerian: Nibru, often logographically recorded as 𒂗𒆤𒆠, EN.LÍLKI, \"Enlil City;\" Akkadian: Nibbur) was an ancient Sumerian city. It was the special seat of the worship of the Sumerian god Enlil, the \"Lord Wind\", ruler of the  cosmos, subject to An alone. Nippur was located in modern Nuffar 8 kilometers north of modern Afak, Al-Qādisiyyah Governorate, Iraq. It is roughly 200 km south of modern Baghdad and about 100 km southeast of the ancient city of Babylon. Occupation at the site extended back to the Ubaid period (Ubaid 2 – Hajji Muhammed), the Uruk period, and the Jemdet Nasr period. The origin of the ancient name is unknown but different proposals have been made.",

          "content": "Hatra (; Arabic: الحَضْر (Arabic pronunciation: [al.ˈħadˀr]); Syriac: ܚܛܪܐ) was an ancient Arab  city in Upper Mesopotamia located in present-day eastern Nineveh Governorate in northern Iraq. The ruins of the city lie 290 km (180 mi) northwest of Baghdad and 110 km (68 mi) southwest of Mosul. It is considered the richest archaeological site from the Parthian Empire known to date.\nHatra was a strongly fortified caravan city and capital of the small Arab Kingdom of Hatra, located between the Roman and Parthian/Sasanian Empires. Hatra flourished in the 2nd century, and was destroyed and deserted in the 3rd century. Its ruins were discovered in the 19th century.\n\nName\nHatra is known as al-Ḥaḍr (الحضر) in Arabic. It is recorded as 𐣧𐣨𐣣𐣠 (ḥṭrʾ, vocalized as: Ḥaṭrāʾ) in Hatran Aramaic inscriptions, probably meaning \"enclosure, hedge, fence\". In Syriac, it is usually recorded in the plural form Ḥaṭrē. In Roman works, it is recorded as Greek Átra and Latin Hatra and Hatris.\nThe temple of Shamash, was officially called Beit ʾElāhāʾ 𐣡𐣩𐣵 𐣠𐣫𐣤𐣠‎ \"House of God\", in Hatran Aramaic inscriptions The city was recorded as \"Enclosure of Shamash\" (ḥtrʾ d-šmš 𐣧𐣨𐣣𐣠 𐣣𐣴𐣬𐣴‎) on a coin.\n\nHistory\nThere is no archeological information on the city before the Parthian period but settlement in the area likely dates back to at least the Seleucid period. Hatra flourished under the Parthians, during the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, as a religious and trading center. Later on, the city became the capital of possibly the first Arab Kingdom in the chain of Arab cities running from Hatra, in the northeast, via Palmyra, Baalbek and Petra, in the southwest. The region controlled from Hatra was the Kingdom of Hatra, a semi-autonomous buffer kingdom on the western limits of the Parthian Empire, governed by Arabian princes.\n\nHatra became an important fortified frontier city and played an important role in the Second Parthian War, withstanding repeated attacks by the Roman Empire. During the 2nd century CE the city repulsed sieges by both Trajan (116/117) and Septimius Severus (198/199). Hatra's forces defeated the ascendant Sassanid Persians in 238 at the battle of Shahrazoor, but fell shortly after in 241 to the army of Sassanid king Shapur I and was destroyed. The traditional stories of the fall of Hatra tell of al-Nadirah, daughter of the King of Araba, who betrayed the city into the hands of Shapur as she fell in love with him. The story tells of how Shapur killed the king and married al-Nadirah, but later had her killed also after realizing her ingratitude towards her father.\nHatra was the best preserved and most informative example of ancient Arabian architecture. Its plan was circular, and was encircled by inner and outer walls nearly 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) in diameter and supported by more than 160 towers. A temenos (τέμενος) surrounded the principal sacred buildings in the city's centre. The temples covered some 1.2 hectares and were dominated by the Great Temple, an enormous structure with vaults and columns that once rose to 30 metres. The city was famed for its fusion of Greek, Mesopotamian, Canaanite, Aramean and Arabian pantheons, known in Aramaic as Beiṯ Ĕlāhā (\"House of God\"). The city had temples to Nergal (Assyrian-Babylonian and Akkadian), Hermes (Greek), Atargatis (Syro-Aramaean), Allat, Shamiyyah (Arabian), and Shamash (the Mesopotamian sun god). Other deities mentioned in the Hatran Aramaic inscriptions were the Aramaean Ba'al Shamayn, and the female deity known as Ashurbel, which was perhaps the assimilation of the two deities the Assyrian god Ashur and the Babylonian Bel—despite their being individually masculine.\n\nList of rulers\nIn inscriptions found at Hatra, several rulers are mentioned. Other rulers are sporadically mentioned by classical authors. The earlier rulers are titled mrjʾ (māryā, \"lord\") and the later ones mlkʾ d-ʿrb (\"king of the Arabs\"; malkā, \"king\").\n\nArt of Hatra\nAccording to John M. Rosenfield, the statuary of Hatra belong to the Parthian cultural sphere, with numerous similarities in terms of clothing, decorative elements or posture, which tend to be massive and frontal, with feet often splayed. The architecture of Hatra itself is generally seen as an example of Parthian architecture. Similarities can be seen with the Art of the Kushans as well, due either to direct cultural exchanges between the area of Mesopotamia and the Kushan Empire at that time, or from a common Parthian artistic background leading to similar types of representation.\n\nModern Hatra\nHatra was used as the setting for the opening scene in the 1973 film The Exorcist, and since 1985 has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe site was first surveyed by Walter Andrae of the German excavation team working in Assur from 1906 to 1911. But systematic excavations have been undertaken only from 1951 by Iraqi archeologists. From the 1980s, the Italian Archaeological Expedition, directed by R. Ricciardi Venco (University of Turin), made major discoveries at Hatra. The excavations were focused on an important house (\"Building A\"), located close to the Temenos, and on deep soundings in the Temenos central area. Now the Expedition is active in different projects regarding the preservation and development of the archaeological site. In 1990, a Polish expedition of the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw recorded and studied the city's defense walls.\nIn 2004, The Daily Telegraph stated \"Hatra's finely preserved columns and statues make it one of the most impressive of Iraq's archaeological sites\"\n\nRestoration by Saddam Hussein\nSaddam Hussein saw the site's Mesopotamian history as reflecting glory on himself, and sought to restore the site, and others in Ninevah, Nimrud, Ashur and Babylon, as a symbol of Arab achievement, spending more than US$80 million in the first phase of restoration of Babylon. Saddam Hussein demanded that new bricks in the restoration use his name (in imitation of Nebuchadnezzar) and parts of one restored Hatra temple have Saddam's name.\n\nPartial destruction and looting by ISIL\nActions by the forces of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which occupied the area in mid-2014, were a major threat to Hatra. In early 2015 they announced their intention to destroy many artifacts, claiming that such \"graven images\" were un-Islamic, encouraged shirk (or polytheism), and could not be permitted to exist, despite the preservation of the site for 1,400 years by various Islamic regimes. ISIL militants pledged to destroy the remaining artifacts.  Shortly thereafter, they released a video showing the destruction of some artifacts from Hatra. After the bulldozing of Nimrud on March 5, 2015, \"Hatra of course will be next\" said Abdulamir Hamdani, an Iraqi archaeologist from Stony Brook University. On March 7, Iraqi official sources reported ISIS had begun the demolishing the ruins of Hatra. A video released by ISIL during the next month showed the destruction of the monuments.\nUNESCO and ISESCO issued a joint statement saying \"With this latest act of barbarism against Hatra, (the IS group) shows the contempt in which it holds the history and heritage of Arab people.\"\nThe pro-Iraqi government Popular Mobilization Forces captured the city on 26 April 2017. A spokeswoman for the militias stated that ISIL had destroyed the sculptures and engraved images of the site, but its walls and towers were still standing though they contained holes and scratches received from ISIL bullets. PMF units also stated that the group had mined the site's eastern gates, thus temporarily preventing any assessment of damage by archaeologists. It was reported on 1 May that the site had suffered less damage than feared earlier. A journalist of EFE had earlier reported finding many destroyed statues, burnt buildings as well as signs of looting. Layla Salih, head of antiquities for Nineveh Governorate, stated that most of the buildings were intact and the destruction didn't compare with that of other archaeological sites of Iraq. A PMF commander also stated that the damage was relatively minor.\n\nGallery\nClimate\nHatra has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh). Most rain falls in the winter. The average annual temperature in Hatra is 20.7 °C (69.3 °F). About 257 mm (10.12 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nSee also\nAramaic of Hatra\nDestruction of cultural heritage by the Islamic State\nTaq-i Kisra, sharing architectural features with structures at Hatra\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nal-Salihi, W.

الرافدين الذي هو غرب العراق وشرق سوريا حالياً، حُدُود المملكه هي اسوار مدينه الحضر بفتح الحاء وسكون الضاد المعجمه والراء المهمله وتعني المكان المحضور الذي يمنع فيه تداول ما لايليق لموقعه المقدس. وهي مدينه لطيفه بين دجله والزاب، مسافه 110 كيلومتراً جنوب غرب الموصل على نهر الثرثار. وتبعد عن مدينه اشور القديمه حوالي 70 كيلومتراً. ظهرت مملكه الحضر في المئه الثالثه الميلاديه وحكمها اربعه ملوك استمر حكمهم قرابه المائه عام.\nعرفت مملكه الحضر (مملكه عربايا) بعمائرها وفنونها وعساكرها وصناعاتها، كانت هذه المدينه تجاري رومه في العمران حيث وجد فيها حمامات ذات نظام تسخين متطور، وابراج، ومحكمه، ونقوش منحوته، وفسيفساء، وعملات معدنيه، وتماثيل، كما ضربوا النقود على الطريقه اليونانيه والروميه، وجمعوا ثروات طائله بسبب تجاراتها واسواقها وقوافلها.\nوجدت كتابه على احد المباني تقول: «سنطروق هو ملك العرب»، وسنطروق يسمى في كتب الاخباريين بالساطرون واسمهُ الضيزن. حاول الفرس والرومانيين غزوها مراراً وفشل امبراطور الروم تراجان ومن بعده سيبتيموس سيفيروس سنه 199م بعد ان غزا كلاً من بابل وسلوقيه وطيسفون لان اهلها دافعوا عنها دفاعاً عنيداً، واستخدموا اقواساً مركبه ترمي سهمين بنفس الوقت وقتلوا بها بعضاً من حرس الامبراطور، وهزموا جيش الملك اردشير الاول، الذي اخذ الجزيره كلها حتى سقطت على يد الفرس عام 241 م ودمّرت تدميراً شديداً ومنع اهلها من حمل السلاح، وكانت تلك نهايه مملكه العرب.\nيذكر ان الاشكانيين اخذوا صنائع وفنون وعادات الحضر. وهناك ممالك عربيه كانت قائمه في اقليم الهلال الخصيب ومتقاربه في الزمن، اهمها: مملكه الانباط - عاصمتها البتراء، ومملكه تدمر - عاصمتها تدمر، ودوله المناذره - عاصمتها الحيره، ودوله الغساسنه - عاصمتها الجابيه.\n\nمدينه الحضر التاريخيه\nمدينه الحضر مستديره تقريباً، قطرها حوالي الكيلومترين يحيط بها خندق عميق محكم الجانب كما يحيطها سور مدعم بـ 163 برجاً، ويتكون هذا السور من جدارين عرض كل منهما 3م و 2.5م وبينهما مسافه 12م عند البوابه الشماليه. كما وجد خط ترابي يلف بالمدينه من جميع الجهات على بعد نصف كيلومتر خارج السور، ولا يعرف ان كان سوراً خارجياً ام انه حلقه احكم بها العدو حصاره للمدينه، وتقع على اطرافها عدد من القلاع. وقد تميزت المدينه بموقع يحتل اهميه تجاريه وعسكريه، فضلاً عن وفره مياهها العذبه واراضيها الخصبه.\n\nشعار المدينه هو النسر، وهو يمثل قوه وهيبه المدينه التي يحكمها ال نصر الاقوياء. اشتهرت الحضر في زمن جذيمه الوضاح الابرش والذي اغتالته الزباء ملكه تدمر. وكان سكان الحضر وثنيون يعبدون الهه منها اللات وشمش «الشمس» ثم تحولوا الى الديانه المسيحيه وغدت دولتهم دوله دينيه تحكم بحكم ديمقراطي حيث يحق للكل ابداء رايه.\n\nصعود المدينه وسياقها الجغرافي والسياسي\nيبدو ان مدينه الحضر ظهرت في القرن الاول الميلادي. لا توجد اكتشافات في الموقع او اي مصدر مكتوب يُشير الى انها كانت موجوده من قبل، على الرغم من ذكر بلده في نفس المنطقه في نص من القرن الثامن عشر قبل الميلاد؛ لها اسم مُشابه، هاشوارو (Haṣaru)، مبني على نفس الجذر السامي الذي يعني «السياج او السور».\nسيطر الفرثيون في وقت انشاء الحضرعلى بلاد ما بين النهرين العليا من 120 الى 110 قبل الميلاد. كان يسكنها اناس يتحدثون اللهجات الاراميَّه، وهم من نسل الاشوريين والاراميين من النصف الاول من الالفيه الاولى قبل الميلاد، التي اشارت اليها نصوص ذلك الوقت عده مرات بمصطلح «الاشوريون» او «السوريون» بالاضافه الى القبائل العربيه التي استقّرت في المنطقه منذ منتصف الالفيه الاولى للميلاد خاصه حول مدينه الحضر وفي منطقه الفرات الوسطى. كما اطلق المؤلفون اليونانيون والرومانيون على هذه المساحه اسم «شبه الجزيره العربيه».\n\nموقع الحضر في منطقه يبدو انها كانت غيرماهوله في الماضي. تعتبر المنطقه صحراويه، لانه يوجد مجرى مائي واحد وادي الثرثار وهو غير دائم. هذه المنطقه، الجزيره السفلى، هي منطقه هضبه تقع عند حدود المنطقه حيث يمكن الزراعه الجافه؛ رصدت العديد من القرى والمزارع المعاصره في محيطها، خاصه في الشمال حيث تكون الامطار غزيره، مما يشير الى وجود نشاط ثقافي هناك. كانت هذه بلا شك مواقع موسميه يسكنها السكان شبه الرُحّل، حتى لو كانت بعض القرى بلا شك محتله بشكل دائم من قبل مجتمعات المزارعين المستقرين.\nمن ناحيه اخرى، كانت منطقه جنوب الحضر هي السائده وكان هناك القليل من الموائل الثابته. كانت هذه المنطقه حينها تشهد ممارسه السكان لحياه رعويه وهم شبه رحل واولئك الذين يمارسون الزراعه الدائمه. كانت مدينه اشور، العاصمه القديمه لاشورهي المدينه الرئيسيه في محيط مدينه الحضر، وتقع على بعد حوالي خمسين كيلومترًا الى الغرب على نهر دجله. كانت مركزًا مهمًا لعده الاف من السنين، شهدت عوده الازدهار في بدايه الالفيه الاولى. يبدو ان هذه المدينه قد خدمت، مثل الحضر، كمرساه للسلطه البارثيه في الجزء الغربي من بلاد ما بين النهرين العليا.\nعند نقاش اسباب تطور الحضر. غالبًا ما يتم طرح دور تجاره القوافل، حيث تقع المدينه على الطريق الذي يربط طسيفون، عاصمه البارثيين، بسوريا، ولا سيما تقاطع طريق نيسيبه؛ تَظهر الحضر على خريطه بوتينجر التي تُوضّح شبكه طُرق الامبراطوريَّه الرومانيَّه كخطوه على هذا المحور. ولكن لا توجد في الواقع ايه ادله تُنادي بدور رئيسيّ للتجاره في حياه المدينه. التفسير الاكثر شيوعًا هو دورها كملاذ ديني يخدم السكان المستقرين والبدو في المنطقه، ويعبدون اله الشمس والالهه العظيمه الاخرى في المدينه. لكن الواقع هو بلا شك اكثر تعقيدًا، فهناك العديد من العوامل التي يجب ان تلعبها، بما في ذلك تنميه المناطق النائيه الزراعيه التي لم تكن بالضروره فقيره كما يعتقد المرء عمومًا. · . كان للعامل السياسيّ دوره ايضًا. يبدو ان الحضر اكدت نفسها ككيان سياسي تابع للبارثيين، الذين سيطروا بعد ذلك على بلاد ما بين النهرين والهضبه الايرانيه. يتوافق ظهور مدينه الحضر في التاريخ مع التوسع الاقصى لمملكه حدياب (اربيل ونينوى واكباتان وغوغميلا)، الواقعه شمال الحضر. وفقًا لخافيير تيكسدور، في القرن الاول، ربما سيطرت هذه المملكه ايضًا على مدينه الحضر. بالنسبه الى تيكسدور، الذي يلخص الموقف المهيمن،\n\n. غالبًا ما يُنظر الى مملكه الحضر على انها نوع من الدوله العازله بين الامبراطوريه الرومانيه والبارثيين، تتمتع بشبه استقلال: يبدو ان البارثيين لم يولوا اهتمامًا كبيرًا بشؤون اتباعهم. لم يحبطوا مشاريعهم وقدموا لهم دعمهم عند الحاجه. لكن العلاقات بين الحضر والبارثيين موثقه بشكل سيئ للغايه، واعاده بنائها من قبل المؤرخين مبنيه على فرضيات، معقوله ولكن لا يمكن اثباتها، ولا يوجد نص يستحضر علاوه على ذلك الهاتريان والبارثيين الذين يقاتلون جنبًا الى جنب. وقد ادى هذا بلا شك الى التقليل من الدور المناسب لملوك الحضر، التي يتم تقديم سياستها الخارجيه بشكل عام من خلال منظور الازدواجيه بين البارثيين والرومان.\n\nبدايات التوسع\nقام المؤلف الاول الذي ذكر وجود الحضر، كاسيوس ديو، بذلك ليذكر الحصار الفاشل للمدينه بقياده الامبراطور الروماني تراجان حيث عاد من حمله في بابل ضد البارثيين، وكان عليه ايضا مواجهه تمرد من البلدان التي تركها وراءه بعد الجزء الاول من الحمله (التي بدات عام 114). يستحضر المؤرخ مدينه ليست غنيه ولا مزدهره، والتي لم يكن لديها الحجم الذي كانت ستاخذه في السنوات التاليه. ومع ذلك، كان سكانها قادرين على مقاومه المحاصرين بقوه. كان من الممكن ان يفشل الحصار لان القوات الرومانيه، التي اختبرها المناخ الصحراوي وقادها امبراطور في تدهور صحته (كان من المقرر ان يموت بعد فتره وجيزه)، كانت تفتقر الى الماء والعشب لحمله الى نهايته:\n\nيبدو ان ازدهار مدينه الحضر بدا بعد انسحاب القوات الرومانيه. على اي حال، في هذا الوقت، يعود اقدم نقش تم العثور عليه في الموقع، والذي يمكن تاريخه على وجه اليقين، والذي يتعلق ببناء غرفه في الحرم الرئيسي للمدينه. ثم قادها شخصيه تدعى ورود Worod، تحمل في النقوش لقب «اللورد» (māryā)، والتي ربما كانت في المنصب بالفعل اثناء حصار تراجان. يظهر في نقوش اثنين من امراء الحضر، الكود ومعاني، لكن لم يُعرف متى حكموا.\n\nعصر «ملوك العرب»\nهناك نقش مؤرخ في 134 يشير الى اللورد الذي حكم المدينه انذاك، نشريحب، وابنه الاكبر نصري، الذي يبدو انه ارتبط بممارسه السلطه. اصبح هذا الاخير بدوره سيدًا في السنوات التي تلت ذلك. تميّز هذان العهدان بنشاط انشائي مكثف: شُيِّد سور الحرم العظيم في عام 138 بمبادره من نصر، في ذلك الوقت ولي العهد، ثم على الاقل في بدايه عام 150 عامًا. محيط خارجي كبير للمدينه يرتفع عن الارض، مما يوسع الى حد كبير المساحه التي تغطيها المدينه؛ لم يتم تحديد مسار الجدران السابقه من قبل علماء الاثار. العديد من المعابد مؤرخه ايضا من عهده. على النقوش التي تخلد ذكرى هذه الاعمال، قدم نصري نفسه ايضًا على انه «رئيس كهنه اله الشمس» (افكالا ربّ شمش)، مما يشير الى ان منصبه كان له ايضًا جانب ديني. وساعده في اداء مهامه احد الوجهاء يُدعى رَبِيته، «خادم البيت (الاله)». كان له بلا شك وظيفه دينيه بالدرجه الاولى لانه كان مسؤول عن نشر المراسيم القانونيه للمدينه، التي يُنسب اصلها الى الالهه.\nخليفه نصري هو ابنه ولجش، اسم من اصل بارثي حمله العديد من حكام هذه الامبراطوريه)، والذي كان اول من حمل لقب «ملك العرب» (malka di Arab)، والذي يبدو انه يكشف عن بسط سلطه امراء الحضر على المناطق المجاوره. ثم زودت تماثيل الملوك بتاج متوج يميز ملوك الحضر التابعين. نحن لا نعرف بالضبط تحت اي ظروف حدث هذا التطور. قد يكون من الضروري ربطه بالاحداث التي نجمت عن النزاعات بين البارثيين والرومان: في السنوات 161-165، بعد عده حروب، خسر الملك البارثي فولوغيس الرابع الوادي الاوسط من نهر الفرات لصالح خصومه، التي سلبته السياده على مملكه الرها (او اسروين). كان بامكانه حينئذٍ ان يسعى الى زياده قوه اتباعه في الحضر لتقويه مكانتهم في نظامه الدفاعي، من خلال رفعهم الى الكرامه الملكيه ومنحهم السلطه على السكان المجاورين. لكن في غياب وثيقه صريحه حول هذه النقطه، يظل هذا تخمينيًا. ربما لم يحكم ولوعاش لفتره طويله، منذ ان خلفه شقيقه سنطروق الاول على ابعد تقدير في عام 177. حكم السناتريك لبضع سنوات، وربط ابنه عبدسميا بالعمل التجاري، ومنحه لقب «ولي العهد» (pašgrībā)، قبل ان يخلفه على ابعد تقدير في عام 193. وفي هذا التاريخ، ظهر بالفعل في نص كتبه المؤرخ هيروديان، تحت اسم بارسمياس، في سياق الحرب الاهليه التي كانت تجري في الامبراطوريه الرومانيه: ارسل فرقه من الرماه، بناءً على طلب الملك البارثي فولوجيز الخامس، الى المندوب الروماني سوريا، بيسكينيوس النيجر، الذي ادعى لقب امبراطور. هزم سبتيموس سيفيروس الاخير اخيرًا، وردا على ذلك، حاصر الحضر مرتين في التسعينيات، وعانى من اخفاقين امام الاسوار الصلبه للمدينه. كان اكثر نجاحًا في مناطق غرب الحضر، حيث شكل فيلقًا مواجهًا للمدينه مباشره.\nيبدو ان العلاقات بين الحضر والبارثيين كانت بعيده الى حد ما. يستحضر هيروديان (III.28) حقيقه ان الملك البارثي «(راى نفسه) غريبًا تمامًا عن القتال الدائر بين سيفيروس وهاتريين، ولم (ياخذ) اي ظل لهذه الحرب». بمرور الوقت، يبدو التاثير البارثي اقل وضوحًا في المنطقه وملوك الحضر اكثر استقلاليه. يفسر السياق العسكري بلا شك سبب قيام ابن عبد السميع، سناطريق الثاني، بتعزيز اسوار المدينه في عام 200، عندما كان لا يزال ولي العهد فقط. حكم في العقود الاولى من القرن الثالث، وربط ابنه عبد السميع (الثاني) بالسلطه، لكن لا يُعرف ما اذا كان هذا الاخير قد خلفه.\n\nسقوط المدينه واسطورتها\nادى سقوط الامبراطوريه الفرثيه ضد الفرس بقياده اردشير، مؤسس السلاله الساسانيه عام 223، الى تغيير الجغرافيا السياسيه لبلاد ما بين النهرين والشرق الاوسط باكمله. استغرق الامر بضع سنوات للقوات الفارسيه للقضاء على اخر ملوك بارثيين واخضاع اتباعه الرئيسيين على الهضبه الايرانيه. ثم تحول اردشير الى الغرب، ضد الرومان، الذين كان سنطروق الثاني قد ناشدهم لتجنب مشاركه مصير الخدم الاخرين للبارثيين. نقش عثر عليه في الحضر يعود تاريخه الى 235 يشير الى ان جماعه رومانيه كانت تتمركز هناك. لذلك من الممكن ان تكون الحضر في ذلك الوقت حليفه وحتى عميل للرومان، او حتى انها شهدت توسعًا جديدًا في سلطتها، نحو الغرب، على القبائل العربيه التابعه بالفعل لروما من قبل.\nعلى اي حال، عانت المدينه من حصار الفرس بقياده شابور الاول بن اردشير في السنوات التاليه. تم اخذها اخيرًا في 240، في ظل ظروف لم يتم تحديدها. يوثق علم الاثار قبل كل شيء الاعمال المرتبطه بالحصار النهائي للساسانيين، الذين تولى بناء جدران الالتفاف والمعادله المرتبطه بمخيمهم، ولا شك انه سيتم البحث عنها في شرق المدينه. من الواضح ان سكان المدينه قد تم ترحيلهم بالكامل، وفقًا لعادات المنتصرين. لم يتم اعاده اسكان المدينه ابدًا لانه لم يتم العثور على اي اثر للاحتلال بعد الحصار. عندما مر بالمنطقه عام 363، عقب عوده حمله الامبراطور يوليان المرتد الكارثيه ضد الساسانيين، وصف المؤرخ اميانوس مارسيليانوس مدينه الحضر بانها\n\nذُكِرَ سقوط الحضر في التقاليد الايرانيه والعربيه اللاحقه، فظهرت قصائد رثائيه حول موضوع القوه المدمره . ولا يزال الحدث بحد ذاته ضعيف المعلومات، لانه غالبًا ما كان يؤرخ بشكل سيئ، من ذلك ما رواه فردوس الذي وضعه تحت حكم سابور الثاني في القرن الرابع. فقد تتبع روايات سقوط الحضر التي رواها مؤلفون مختلفون، وكذلك المؤرخ الطبري (القرن العاشر). وكان يقال ان ملك الحضر قد استفز الملك الساساني سابور الاول بمهاجمه اراضيه، واسر شقيقته.\nوكان هذا الاخير سيشن هجومًا ضده ويحاصر مدينته دون نجاح لعده اشهر. ذُكرت عده روايات لسقوط المدينه غالبيتها تلقي اللوم على الاميره نادره او (نظيره) ابنه ملك الحضرالضيزن اذ بعدما حاصر سابور المدينه اشرفت عليه النضيره، بنت الضيزن وهويته فكتب في سهم يدل على عوره الحصن، فاتتها من مدخل الماء ورمت بالسهم اليه، فقطع الماء عنهم حتى اجهدهم العطش، ثم استندبهم على حكمه وقتل النضيره. وذُكر ان ابنه الضيزن مليكه وليست نادرهامها عمه سابور دختوش ابنه نرسي كان الضيزن قد سباها عندما غزا طيسفون وان دخول المدينه كان باعاز منها لسابور ان ياتي رجاله من الثرثار وفيه فجوه تؤدي الى الحصن، وقيل انها اسكرت اباها ليوافق على الزواج بدلا من ان يرفضه ويورد الحميري ان اسقاء الملك الخمر كان لغرض سرقه مفاتيح الحصن، اما ماورد في روايه انها كانت ستوضّح لشابور طقوسًا سحريه تجعل من الممكن جعل التعويذه التي تحمي جدران المدينه التي لا يمكن اختراقها غير فعاله، والا لكانت قد سمّمت والدها وسلمت مفاتيح المدينه الى سابور، او حتى قيل للاخير كيف يدخل المدينه عن طريق النهر. بمجرد الاستيلاء على المدينه، وفى سابور الاول بوعده بالزواج، ثم ادرك ليله الزفاف ان جلد الاميره كان رقيقًا للغايه عند رؤيتها تنزف بعد ملامستها لورقه الاس. طلب تفسيرا، واخبرته الاميره ان ذلك بفضل العلاجات التي اغدقت على بشرتها بفضل والدها، المليء بالاهتمام تجاهها. لقد شعر بالفضيحه من حقيقه ان زوجته الجديده كان من الممكن ان تخون مثل هذا الاب المحب وخوفًا من ان تفعل الشيء نفسه معه، فقد اعدمها. وفقًا للبعض، هذه القصه هي سلف بعيد لقصه الاميره وحبه البازلاء، التي روج لها هانز كريستيان اندرسن. يجدر الاشاره الى انه لم يرد اي نص في الحضر يذكر الضيزن او النضيره المثبت ان الحضر سقطت بعد حصار مرير استمر عاماً كاملاً من مطلع نيسان 240 الى نيسان 241م.\n\nالعماره والعمران\nفي حالتها النهائيه، من منتصف القرن الثاني، كانت الحضر مدينه ذات مخطط دائري تقريبًا، وفقًا لنموذج تخطيط المدن الذي يبدو انه كان شائعًا في بلاد ما بين النهرين البارثيين منذ العثور عليها في اربيل (حدياب القديمه وحاليًا في اربيل) وطيسفون.\n\nيوجد في وسطها معبد كبير مخصص لشمش اله الشمس، النصب الحجري الوحيد في مدينه مصنوع بالكامل من الطوب اللبن. يمكن القول ان هذا الضريح، الذي تضمن عده معابد في نهايه ساحه واسعه، كان موقعًا للحج السنوي لعرب بلاد ما بين النهرين. تم بناء النسيج العمراني بشكل تدريجي بدون مخطط رئيسي في جميع الاتجاهات حول هذا الحرم المركزي. كان محميًا بجدار مزدوج من الطوب الخام. لا يزال التطور التاريخي للموقع غير معروف بشكل جيد خارج القرن الاخير من وجوده، ومن الصعب معرفه اي الاثار هي الاقدم، وما هو الجانب الذي كانت للمدينه قبل الاعمال الكبرى في القرن الثاني التي رافقت التطور الحقيقي للحضر.\n\nالسور\nعثرت فرق التنقيب الايطاليه والبولنديه بالقرب من السياج المقدس على اثار لجدران من الحجر والطوب اللبن، قبل انشاءات اخرى في الموقع. يبدو ان هذه هي بقايا سور كان يحيط بالحضر قبل بناء السور الاحدث واكثرها وضوحًا خلال الحفريات، تلك التي بنيت في عهد نصرو في منتصف القرن الثاني. لذلك، فان هذا السور الاول هو الذي واجهته قوات تراجان، قبل الصعود الحقيقي للحضر الذي شهد تشييد جدار اكثر قوه يشمل مساحه اكبر بالاضافه الى السياج المقدس. لا يمكن تحديد المساحه التي يحدها هذا الجدار الاول على وجه اليقين لان مساره لم يتم تحديده بوضوح بعد.\n\nالسور الرئيسي في الحضر، الذي يمتد لمسافه 6 كيلومترات، معروف جيدًا بفضل الحفريات التي كان موضوعها. كان يسبقه خندق مائي ومحدود بمساحه دائريه تقريبًا. كان عملاً من الطوب اللبن والطين، يرتكز على قاعده حجريه يبلغ ارتفاعها حوالي متر واحد وعرضها 3.50 مترًا، واكثر في بعض الاماكن التي تم تعزيزها فيها بعد حصار الجيوش الرومانيه. قُدِّر ارتفاعه الاصلي بنحو عشره امتار. يجب ان يكون الجزء العلوي من السور ملونًا، بناءً على العديد من اللوحات المزججه المزرقه التي تم اكتشافها. كانت الابراج التي تفصل بينها حوالي ثلاثين متراً دافعت عن الجدار واضيفت حصون حجريه الى الجهاز لدعم المقاليع اثناء الحصار. قرب نهايه وجود المدينه، تضاعف الجدار الرئيسي بجدار داخلي صغير يعمل كخط دفاع ثانٍ. يمكن عبور السور من خلال اربعه بوابات تقع عند النقاط الاساسيه الاربعه، بما في ذلك منعطف صناعي عند المدخل والفناء الداخلي. لذلك كان هذا الجهاز المهيب قادرًا على مقاومه حصار الجيوش الرومانيه، وابقاء الفرس تحت السيطره لمده عامين. اقام الاخير امامه سورًا يحيط بالمدينه باكملها، وهو التفاف حدده علماء الاثار، ويوضح اهميه الجهود التي كان عليهم بذلها لانهاء الحصار\n\nاثار السور المقدسه\nتضمن السور المقدس، الذي حدد مساحه مستطيله تبلغ 320 × 435 مترًا، المعالم الرئيسيه في الحضر، المبنيه من الحجر الحر، والتي كانت موضوع اعاده بناء مهمه (تجميع (ترميم)) من قبل علماء الاثار العراقيين. تم تشييد السور الذي يفصل هذه المجموعه عن باقي المدينه في عهد نصرو عام 138. وقد اخترقت الابواب من جوانبه الاربعه. تم تقسيم هذا السياج الداخلي الى قسمين بواسطه جدار عرضي عازل، الى الشرق، ساحه واسعه ذات مخطط مربع تقريبًا وخاليه تقريبًا من الانشاءات، وتقع المباني الرئيسيه في الجزء الغربي من السياج المقدس، على طول الجدار. في مساحه 320 × 140 مترًا) التي تم تحديدها. كانت بعض الغرف بمثابه مخازن وكذلك اروقه كانت موجوده في اقسام داخليه معينه من العلبه المقدسه. تم فتح المدخل الرئيسي لهذا على ساحه من جانبه الشرقي، وشمل ثلاثه بوابات مؤطره باربعه ابراج. لم يكن المدخل موجودًا في وسط الجدار الذي تم ثقبه فيه، ولكنه كان غريب الاطوار قليلاً باتجاه الشمال، ليواجه، على الجانب الاخر من المتنزه، المعبدان اللذان يفترض انهما الاقدم .\nتم ترتيب العديد من الاضرحه على الجانب الغربي من الباحه، بالقرب من الجدار الداخلي او المجاور له. احتل «المعبد الهلنستي» الموقع المركزي، وهو اسم يرجع الى الحفارين في الموقع (المصطلح غير مناسب تمامًا لان الالهام المعماري بشكل اساسي روماني)، ويسمى ايضًا «معبد ماران»، وهو الالوهيه الرئيسيه للمدينه. في الواقع، لا يُعرف على وجه اليقين اي الالهه كانت تُعبد في هذا الهيكل؛ كما انه من غير المعروف ما اذا كان هناك واحد او اكثر. تميز مظهره بشكل كبير بالتاثير اليوناني والروماني، حتى لو كان تصميمه اصليًا: مستطيل الشكل، يحده صف مزدوج من الاعمده، تم تشييد الصف الثاني على الارض. نفس شرفه المعبد نفسه، وفقًا لمبدا معابد المنصه من النوع الروماني. كان للواجهه، التي ترتكز اعمدتها على المنصه، قاعده ارشيفيه تميز العماره السوريه للالهام اليوناني الروماني. · .\nتضمنت الساحه الشرقيه ايضًا مبانٍ مهمه اخرى تقع جميعها على جانبها الغربي. الى الشمال، بُني على الجدار المستعرض، كان هناك معبد بواجهته ثلاثه ايوانات، غرف كبيره مقببه مثقوبه على جانب واحد من الشرفه على شكل قوس كبير، وهو سمه من سمات العماره في الفتره البارثيه، وتوجد في العديد من المباني في الحضر. شُيِّد هذا المبنى في عهد سنطروق الاول وكرس للالهه اللات، ممثله في العديد من النقوش البارزه. في الركن الجنوبي الغربي من المتنزه وفي وسطه، كان هناك مذبحان مكشوفان، غير معروف الاستخدام.\nعلى مستوى المعبد المعروف باسم ماران، سمحت بوابتان مقنطتان بالوصول، في الجزء الغربي من السياج المقدس، الى المعبد الاول، المعروف باسم شاهيرو، الذي بني على نفس مستوى المعبد السابق؛ لا شك في ان الجدار الذي يفصل بينهما قد اقيم بعد المعبدين اللذين ربما يكونان الاقدم في الموقع. يشتمل مدخل هذا المعبد الثاني، المواجه للجنوب، على رواق باربعه اعمده وباب مقوس نصف دائري يفتح على السيلا، على طراز ايوان  · .\nتم عبور الجزء الغربي من السياج المقدس نفسه بجدار عرضي، يمر عبر النصب الاكبر للحضر، الواقع في وسط هذا الجزء من السياج المقدس. كان نصبًا ضخمًا يبلغ طوله 115 مترًا، ويتالف من ثمانيه صفوف من الاقواس، بما في ذلك ايوانان اعلى من الاخر، بارتفاع يزيد عن 25 مترًا ويفتحان على غرفتين مقببتين بمساحه 34 قدمًا 15 مترًا (ايوان جنوبي وايوان مركزي) انا فزت). كان هذان البابان الكبيران يحدهما اعمده طويله متداخله مع تيجان كورنثيه، تفصلهما عن صفين من الايوانات الاصغر، وتلك التي تعلوها كانت مغلقه بجدار. انفتح الايوان الجنوبي الكبير على صرح مربّع كبير تبلغ مساحته 28 متراً مربعاً، وربما يكون اضافه متاخره، مؤلفه من غرفه مركزيه مربعه مقبّبه، يحيط بها رواق مقنطر بدوره. يوجد ايوانان متوسطان الحجم في الجزء الشمالي من المبنى ويفتحان على نفس الغرفه المستعرضه المقببه؛ ربما تم بناؤها في وقت متاخر عن بقيه البناء. اختفى سقف المبنى، ولكن تم العثور على بلاطاته المزججه الزرقاء اثناء اعمال التنقيب على الارض. يبدو ان الغرفه المقببه المربعه الواقعه خلف الايوان الجنوبي الكبير كانت مكان العباده الرئيسي لاله الشمس، حيث تم استخدام الممر الذي يحدها من جوانبها الاربعه في طقوس الطواف. كان من المقرر ان تكون الغرف التي فتحت لها الابواب المقوسه الاصغر حجرات مجاوره للمحراب. من ناحيه اخرى، يبدو ان الايوان الكبير كان عباره عن اماكن للاجتماعات كانت تستخدم لاستقبال العديد من الضيوف، كما يتضح من المقاعد التي كانت على حواف الايوان الكبيرين في المجمع الرئيسي. بالمعنى الدقيق للكلمه، لم تكن بالضروره ملاذات، على الاقل ليس بالمعنى الكلاسيكي للمصطلح، مثل \"قدس الاقداس\"، على الرغم من انها تبدو وكانها رتبت مذابح على المنصات هناك. كانت مناسبات الاجتماعات ان تكون مهرجانات دينيه تتميز بالتضحيات والمادب الطقسيه التي تشهد بوفره في الديانات الساميه في ذلك الوقت. كانت هذه لحظات مهمه في الحياه السياسيه والدينيه للمدينه، حيث استقبل امراء الحضر، وكبار كهنه اله الشمس، ممثلين عن قبائل منطقتهم، وبالتالي اكدوا دورهم \"ملك الحضر\". العرب \".\nيوجد مزاران اخران في النصف الجنوبي من الجزء الغربي من الحرم المقدس: «معبد ساميه» و«معبد الثالوث». كلاهما يشتمل على ثلاثه ايوانات مصطفه على نفس الواجهه، والواجهه المركزيه اكبر، وتعيد انتاج نموذج المعبد الرئيسي بحجم اصغر.\n\nالانشاءات الاخرى\nتشكل الفراغ بين الجدار والسور المقدس المنطقه السكنيه لمدينه الحضر. تظهر الصور الجويه للموقع انه تم تشييده على معظم مساحته، وان تصميم الطرق الرئيسيه، العريضه، كان لا يزال واضحًا على الارض في وقت الحفريات، وكذلك الطرق الثانويه الاخرى. اضيق مع تخطيط غير منتظم اكثر. ولكن كما هو الحال في كثير من الاحيان مع المدن القديمه، فان هذه المنطقه الخاليه من الاثار الكبرى لم تجذب انتباه علماء الاثار حتى وقت متاخر، وبالتالي فهي اقل شهره من المجمع الضخم.\nومع ذلك، فقد رصدت فرق من علماء الاثار العراقيين عده مبانٍ في هذه المنطقه، بما في ذلك اربعه عشر معبدًا داخل المدن، اسستها عائلات ثريه من المدينه. كانت مبانٍ ذات مخطط بسيط، بما في ذلك غرفه واسعه مستطيله الشكل تحدها مقاعد وتفتح على غرفه صغيره او مكان بسيط يتضمن صوره الالوهيه المبجله في المكان بالاضافه الى المذبح. لم يكن لديهم بشكل عام اي غرف ملحقه. كان مدخل المعبد ايوانًا، اما معابد الحرم المقدّس  · .\nمن جانبها كشفت الفرق الايطاليه مناطق سكنيه. المساكن الخمسه عشر التي تم استكشافها هي من تقاليد بلاد ما بين النهرين، وتتميز بتنظيم حول فناء داخلي مع ايوان يعمل كمنطقه استقبال. منزل معنو، بالقرب من المعبد الاول، هو الاكبر في الموقع (2700 متر مربع). كان يحتوي على عده وحدات، يتم تنظيم الوحده الرئيسيه حول فناء به ايوانان متقابلان ورواق. وشملت الوحدات الاخرى نوعًا من الاجنحه مع مناطق الاستقبال الخاصه بها، بالاضافه الى المتاجر او الورش. كما قامت نفس الفرق بتطهير جزء كامل من حي يمر عبر الشارع المتجه من شمال السياج المقدس الى البوابه الشماليه لجدار المدينه. تضمنت العديد من المباني والمساكن والمصليات والمتاجر التي فتحت على الشارع باروقه. اكبر سكن بدون عوائق في هذه المنطقه، «المبنى A»، يغطي اكثر من 1.850 متر مربع. تم تنظيمه حول فناء مركزي في ايوان، وزينت بعض جدرانه بالرسومات او الكتابه على الجدران؛ تشير النقوش الى انه كان مقر اقامه رئيس كهنه شاهيرو  ·  · . بالقرب من البوابه الشماليه للجدار، تم ايضًا رصد مبنى فخم يضم فناءً كبيرًا مساحته حوالي 47 × 50 مترًا، ايوانان، لم يكن ابدًا موضع حفريات منهجيه. كما تم استكشاف المقابر في الموقع (تم رصد حوالي 142)، خاصه داخل المدينه، معزوله او مجمعه معًا في مقابر. هذه مبانٍ صغيره مربعه الزوايا، من 6 الى 11 مترًا على الارض، مبنيه من الحجر وفي بعض الاحيان لها زخرفه خارجيه، وشبه اعمده مشغوله. يمكن ان تتكون من غرفه واحده، او مقسمه الى وحدتين او ثلاث وحدات تتكون نفسها من غرفه واحده او اكثر، دون معرفه ما تعكسه هذه الاختلافات (التنوع الثقافي او التغييرات بمرور الوقت؟).\n\nحضاره الحضر\nجاء ازدهار المدينه بشكل رئيسي من استغلال الواحات التي دعمتها، وكذلك من التربيه الواسعه التي مارسها البدو. لا شك انها مارست ايضًا تجاره القوافل، فقد لعبت دوراً في الوساطه التجاريه بين اسيا واوربا.\nلكن احدًا لم يجد في الحضر نقوشًا للقوافل كما في تدمر، المدينه التي تشبهها كثيرًا في اماكن اخرى.\n\nالنقوش واللغات والنصوص\nتضمنت الاثار والاعمال الفنيه في الحضر نقوشًا محفوره او محفوره او مرسومه على كتل حجريه ونقوش وركائز تماثيل. تم التعرف على حوالي 500 في الموقع، ويعود تاريخهم الى القرن الثاني تقريبًا؛ يمكن تاريخ 26 فقط بدقه لانهم اشاروا الى السنوات في الحساب السلوقي.\n\nهذه النصوص مكتوبه بالابجديه الاراميه، اللغه السائده في شمال بلاد ما بين النهرين منذ نهايه الامبراطوريه الاشوريه، في القرن السابع قبل الميلاد. وهي على وجه التحديد نسخه شرقيه من الاراميه، وجدت اخرى منها، لنفس الفتره، في المواقع المجاوره اشور وقبر ابو نايف وفي منطقه تكريت الواقعه جنوبًا. كما ان تهجئتهم قريب جدًا من النقوش من مواقع في ارمينيا (غارني). النقوش الاتيه من سوريا، وخاصه تلك الموجوده في تدمر والسريانيه، هي جزء من تقليد غربي مختلف. تتكون ابجديه الحضر من 22 حرفًا، وهي ثابته في نوعها، وتقرا من اليمين الى اليسار، مثل معظم الابجديات الساميه الاخرى. ·  تعتبر النقوش حذره الى حد ما: تلك من النوع «الضخم»، الاقل عددًا والتي تنبثق من اعلى سلطات المدينه، هي الافضل من حيث التنفيذ، في حين ان تلك من النوع المخطوطه او «الاثريه الزائفه» الاكثر شيوعًا، هي اقل من ذالك. حفنه من النقوش باللغه اللاتينيه تعود الى الفتره الاخيره من الحضر، عندما كانت تضم حاميه رومانيه. من وجهه نظر نمطيه،\n\n(ر. برتولينو). النصوص التذكاريه هي الاكثر عددًا. هذه المجموعه، المكونه من نقوش مختصره، هي في الاساس من النوع الديني، وبالتالي فهي تُعلم في المقام الاول بانثيون الحضر وبعض القوانين الدينيه. بشكل غير مباشر، يمكن دراسه اسماء الاشخاص وفقًا لهذه النصوص، مما يؤكد الطابع التعددي للحضاره المحليه (الاراميه والعربيه والايرانيه)؛ هناك ايضًا القاب رسميه واسماء بعض القبائل بالاضافه الى سلاسل النسب التي تسمح بالتعرف على عائلات معينه. من ناحيه اخرى، لا تساعد هذه النقوش كثيرًا في اعاده بناء التاريخ السياسي للمدينه.\n\nالديانه\nديانه الحضر التي عرفت بدراسه نقوش الموقع وبفضل فنها وهندستها المعماريه لها اصول مختلفه (بلاد ما بين النهرين، سوريه، عربيه، يونانيه رومانيه، ايرانيه).\nالاله الرئيسي للحضر هو اله الشمس، شمش في النقوش (حرفيًا «الشمس»)، شمش في ديانه بلاد ما بين النهرين القديمه. تعرضها العملات المعدنيه في المدينه باسم «حضر شمش» (ḥtrʾ d-šmš)، اي «العلبه (المقدسه) للشمس». ربما كان هذا الاله هو الالوهيه الرئيسيه للمجمع الضخم المسيطر على العلبه المقدسه.\n\nتصر نقوش الحضر بشكل خاص على العباده المكرسه لثلاثيه مكونه من مارين (مرن) «ربنا» ومارتن (مرتن) «سيدتنا» وبار مارين (بر مرجان) «ابن ربنا». يتكون هذا الثالوث من زوجين وابنهما غير معروف في مكان اخر، وبالتالي يشكل اصاله من الحضر. يبقى السؤال حول معرفه ما اذا كان يجب تحديد «ربنا» على انه لقب لشماش مفتوحًا: يبدو ان بعض النقوش تشير الى نعم، ويبدو ان البعض الاخر يميزها على العكس من ذلك. يبدو ان الاله ايجل (نشري، نيشرا)، الذي تتحدث عنه بعض النقوش، مرتبط بمارين والمكتب الملكي. الالهه الاخرى التي تشهد عليها النقوش معروفه جيدًا في اماكن اخرى، لا سيما في تدمر، ولها اصول مختلفه. احد المعابد المهمه في المدينه، الذي اقيم في عهد سنطروق وعبدسميا، تم تكريسه لـ اللَّاتُ (حرفيًا «الالهه»)، الهه من اصل عربي، ممثله على نقوش بارزه في المبنى المخصص لمهرجان مخصص لها مكرسه، حيث قدم له الملك اجلالا. شاهيرو، اله الفجر او القمر، موجود ايضًا في العديد من النقوش. فيما يتعلق بالالهه السوريه، كان في المدينه اماكن عباده مخصصه لبعل شمين، «رب السماوات»، والالهه اتارغاتيس («الالهه السوريه» للمؤلفين اليونانيين والرومان، بحيث يمكن مقارنتها بالالهه الغربيه. -سياسات مثل عشتروت او عنات او عشيرات). فيما يتعلق بالهه بلاد ما بين النهرين، نجد على وجه الخصوص نيرغال، اله العالم السفلي، الذي استوعبه الاغريق والرومان في هيراكليس، والذي يبدو ايضًا انه كان له دور حامي الابواب والمعابد والمنازل في الحضر. يوجد ايضًا مكان عباده مخصص لكاتب الله نبو والالهه ناني، بالاضافه الى شهاده من كاهنه للالهه عشتار دي اربيل، احدى الالهه الرئيسيه في بلاد اشور القديمه، وربما ايضًا اسم ذكر الله اشور.\nلا يُعرف سوى القليل عن الجوانب الملموسه للعباده المكرسه لهذه الالهه. تشير النقوش الى العديد من الوظائف الكهنوتيه، بما في ذلك الكهنه (kmrʾ، المصطلح الارامي؛ مصطلح hdrptʾ من اصل ايراني الذي يشير الى كاهن النار) بالاضافه الى وكلاء المعبد (rbyt)، المسؤولين عن الجوانب اللوجستيه للعباده. كان هناك كاهنات، مثل اولئك الذين كرّسوا للالهه عشتار. تاتي الدلائل على ممارسات العباده من دراسه الهندسه المعماريه للمباني التي تم تحديدها على انها معابد، ولا سيما المذابح التي يجب استخدامها في القرابين والقرابين، بالاضافه الى مقاعد الايوانات العظيمه وبعض المعابد التي يجب ان تكون تستخدم خلال الولائم الطقسيه (المرتبطه تقليديا بعباده الاجداد في بلاد ما بين النهرين القديمه وسوريا). فيما يتعلق بالممارسات الدينيه الاخرى، مثل العرافه، يبدو ان بعض الكتابه على الجدران هي ابراج، وتشير النقوش الى التواصل بين الالهه والبشر من خلال الاحلام (التوحيد).\n\nالفن\nهِمَّتْهم في النحت: مثل النقوش الناتئه على جدران البنايات والتماثيل. فهي مجموعه من الرقم التي تحكي فنون بلاد الجزيره الفراتيه في زمن الاشكانيين. زينت اطلال الحضر بزخارف متقنه وجميله. مثل صور الزهور والنباتات (غالبًا ما تكون كورنثيه، كما في المعبد الكبير) والعتبات، مما يدل على اقتباسهم من فنون الاغريق والروم. والتماثيل المنصوبه على خزائن الايوانات العظيمه. وعلى عتباتهم صور باهره للحيوانات( القنطور، وحوش البحر، والغريفين) وعلى جانبي معبد اللات، صور للربتهم تمتطي ناقه، مقبلهً على المدينه وربما تعني هذه الصور لشعائر دينيه. · .\n\nجل التماثيل او الاصنام والنقوش المكتشفه في المعابد تصور الهتم. ومادتها من الحجر الجيري او المرمر والاحجار المستخرجه من باطن الارض. وصغر حجمها فيه دلاله على انها نذور وقرابين. غالبًا ما تكون مزخرفه، مما يجعل من الممكن التعرف على الالوهيه الممثله وبالتالي الايقونيه الالهيه للحضر. وهكذا يُصَور رب الشمس على انه رجل اصلع، له قرنان، وعلى راسه شعاع الشمس. يظهر بار مارين، في احيان كثيره، بمظهر مشابه، مرتدياً رداءً او نحوه مطرز ذو اكمام قصيره ويلف حول خصره ويشد بحزام من القماش. وربه الشر اكثرهم تبجيلاً وتصويراً هو نرجال هرقليس، وصورته كرجل ملتحٍ، عارٍ، متكئًا على عصاه، مثل زيوس كبير الهه اليونان. كذلك يجسدون نابو برجل متخذاً درعًا، وله لحيه طويلهٌ كثيفه كلحيه ملوك الاشوريين، اكتشف في المعبد الخامس. وايضاً يصورون العقبان، وهو صفه حيوان مارين. غالبًا ما تمثل النقوش البارزه على اللوحات والمذابح شيئًا دينيًا مهمًا في الحضر، يُطلق عليه اسم ساميه، وهو معيار يتكون من عمود تعلق عليه الرموز الدينيه: قمر هلال في الاعلى، واقراص تحتوي على نسر، وتماثيل نصفيه للاله، وحلقات مزخرفه.\nالتماثيل الدنيويه هي عمومًا بالحجم الطبيعي، او حتى اكبر، فارتفاعها 1.90 مترًا. وهذه تماثيل للنذور لانها تصور رجل/ امراه رافعاً يده اليمنى، وهي صفه صلاه اهل العراق والجزيره الفراتيه: تتمثل وظيفتها بالتالي في تمثيل المخلص واستبداله في المعبد حيث وضعت، على ما يبدو على منصات. لهذه التماثيل ايقونات او شعار تميز مكانه المرء الممثل. فيرتدي الملوك ستره مطرزه - يقال انها من الفرس - ذات اكمام طويله، ويلف حولها بحزام، وسيفٍ ذو شفرتين وسروال وخفين. ويطيلون شعورهم، ويضعون تاجاً او اكليل لملوكهم؛ وتزين هذه التيجان بالعقبان، شعار اله الحضر العظيم. وهم ملتحون، والاشراف الذين يرتدون ملابس مماثله لا اصل لهم. ويلي الادنى من الاشراف هم: الكهنه ويرتدون سترات طويله، حفاه، واحيانًا يرتدون قبعه مخروطيه الشكل. يرتدي الجنود، الذين كانوا يرتدون سيفاً طويلاً وعباءه كبيره، غطاء راس مستديرًا احيانًا. «النبلاء»، وهم في الواقع مجموعه لا يمكن تحديد وظيفتها، يرتدون عادهً سترات طويله وسراويل، وهي سمه من سمات نخب العصر البارثي. تمثيل النساء ضعيف مع ثلاثه عشر تمثالًا معروفًا فقط. يرتدون ثوبًا طويلًا، بدون حزام، فوق ستره طويله (خيتون)، ويرتدون اغطيه راس عاليه تدعم الحجاب الذي يقع خلفهم، وكذلك الحلي التي تكون اكثر او اقل ثراءً حسب رتبتهم الاجتماعيه\n\nموقع الحضر في العصر الحديث\nاعاده الاكتشاف والتنقيب والترميم\nاعيد اكتشاف موقع الحضر الذي سقط في النسيان متاخراً بسبب عزلته. اول علماء الاثار الذين اهتموا بها كانوا الفرق الالمانيه بقياده والتر اندريه الذي حفر في موقع قلعه الشرقاط، اشور القديمه في عام 1907 وحدد معالمه الرئيسيه. ومع ذلك، لم يتم حفر الموقع بشكل منهجي حتى عام 1951 من قبل الفرق العراقيه. وسرعان ما تبعهم مشروع اعاده اعمار كبير للمعالم الاثريه الرئيسيه في الموقع، وهي معابد السياج المقدس والعلبه نفسها. نُشر التوليف الاول على الموقع في عام 1974 من قبل فؤاد صفر ومحمد علي مصطفى  · . في ذلك الوقت، كان موقع الحضر موضع اهتمام خاص من جانب النظام البعثي لاحمد حسن البكر، لا سيما بسبب نسبته الى سلاله عربيه، مما اشبع القوميه العربيه التي روج لها هذا النظام الغذائي؛ وهكذا توج مهرجان ربيع الموصل عام 1969، الذي استغله النظام، بتجمع 7000 شخص حول معبد الحضر الكبير. في تلك السنوات نفسها، اعيدت تسميه الحي (القضاء) بما في ذلك الموقع القديم باسمه (الحضر).\nواصلت الفرق العراقيه نشاطها على الموقع حتى حرب الخليج الاولى، بدعم من الفرق الايطاليه خلال الحملات من 1986 الى 1989 ثم بين 1993 و 1997 تحت اشراف روبرتا فينكو ريكياردي ، والفرق البولنديين بقياده ميشيل جوليكوفسكي عام 1990 الذين كرسوا انفسهم لدراسه النظام الدفاعي للمدينه  · .. تم تصنيف الموقع كموقع تراث عالمي لليونسكو في عام 1985/70. استمر العمل على نتائج الحفريات، ولا سيما الاكتشافات الكتابيه ، منذ ذلك الحين، واثنت العديد من التوليفات معرفتنا بالموقع. التكتل الحديث يقع جنوب الموقع في محافظه نينوى قضاء الحضره. في الحضر تم تصوير المشاهد الاولى من فيلم طارد الارواح الشريره (فيلم).\n\nالتدمير\nمعظم الاعمال الفنيه التي تم العثور عليها قبل الحرب في الحضر موجوده في الموصل او متاحف بغداد حيث تم نقلها خلال حرب الخليج الثانيه في عام 2003؛ ثم سُرق جزء منه ولا يزال مطلوبًا. في 7 اذار / مارس 2015 دمّر تنظيم الدوله الاسلاميه موقع الحضر بالمتفجرات والجرافه. بعد الموقع الاثري لنمرود ومتحف الموصل، تم تقديم مدينه الحضر القديمه بشكل صريح على انها الهدف التالي لداعش. ان المدى المادي للضرر، الذي يصعب تقديره، كبير. وقد شجبت اليونسكو هذا التدمير للاماكن المرموقه، الذي نُظم لوسائل الاعلام، باعتباره «جريمه حرب»، كجزء من مشروع خبيث «للتطهير الثقافي». ويصاحب ذلك تجاره عالميه غير مشروعه في بعض الاعمال الفنيه من المواقع المدمره  تمت اضافه الموقع من قبل اليونسكو الى قائمه التراث العالمي المعرض للخطر في يوليو 2015.\nانتزع الحشد الشعبي انقاض مدينه الحضر من الدوله الاسلاميه في 26 ابريل / نيسان 2017. وقالت متحدثه باسم القوات ان داعش دمر المنحوتات والصور المنقوشه للموقع، لكن جدرانه وابراجه كانت لا تزال قائمه على الرغم من احتوائها على ثقوب وخدوش تلقتها من رصاص داعش. كما ذكرت وحدات قوات الحشد الشعبي ان المجموعه قامت بتفكيك البوابات الشرقيه للموقع، وبالتالي منعت مؤقتًا اي تقييم للاضرار من قبل علماء الاثار. اُفيد في 1 مايو ان الموقع تعرض لاضرار اقل مما كان يُخشى في وقت سابق. افاد صحفي من افي في وقت سابق بالعثور على العديد من التماثيل المدمره والمباني المحترقه بالاضافه الى علامات النهب. وقالت ليلى صالح رئيسه اثار محافظه نينوى ان معظم المباني كانت سليمه والدمار لا يقارن مع تدمير المواقع الاثريه الاخرى في العراق. كما ذكر قائد في قوات الحشد الشعبي ان الضرر كان طفيفًا نسبيًا.\n\nملوك الحضر\nوقيل ان ملوك الحضر من قضاعه بن معد \n\nتوالى على هذه المدينه اربعه ملوك في اربع وثمانين سنه  وهم:\n\nالملك ولجش (من 158 حتى 165 م)\nالملك سنطروق الاول/ الساطرون (من 165 حتى 190 م) وهو اخو الملك ولجش. ولقب ب«ملك العرب» حسب ماهو منقوش على الاطلال.\nالملك عبدسميا بن السنطروق (من 190 حتى 200 م)\nالملك سنطروق الثاني بن عبدسميا (من 200 حتى 241 م)\n\nسكان الحضر\nواهل الحضر من العرب، وفيها طوائف من الجرامقه والنبط الذين كان لهم اثرٌ في اللغه والعقيده. كانت مدينه الحضر واقعه على الطريق الرابط بين عاصمتي السلوقيين سلوقيه وانطاكيه.\n\nديانه المملكه\nكان الحضرانيون وثنيين يعبدون الهه عده منها اللات وشمش «الشمس» قد اطلق الحضرانيون كلمه (شمش) ليعنوا بها الحقيقه المطلقه، ونعتوا الشمس بالاله الاكبر وقد صوروه على هيئه كهل عاقل كما تبين رسومهم على اقواس واسكفات في المعبد الكبير.\nوقد اختلف حول اسم الاله شمش وله اسماء كثيره عند عرب الجاهليه، فهو من الالهه التي عبدتها العرب منذ القدم في شمال جزيره العرب واليمن. وقيل انها كانت الهاً ذكراً عند العرب. اما بعل سمين او «بعل شمين» فهو الهه شبيهه عند عرب اليمن وهو رب السماء عند اليمانيين الذين اخذوا عبادته من العرب الشماليين.\n\nمعرض الصور\nانظر ايضًا\nمدينه الحضر\nمملكه ميسان\nمملكه المناذره\n\nالمراجع\nوصلات خارجيه\nمقاله بورتر\nمن كتاب الروض الانف\nمن كتاب تاريخ ابن خلدون\n- رويده النواب - العماره

          "title": "Nimrud",
          "content": "Nimrud (; Syriac: ܢܢܡܪܕ Arabic: النمرود) is an ancient Assyrian city (original Assyrian name Kalḫu, biblical name Calah) located in Iraq, 30 kilometres (20 mi) south of the city of Mosul, and 5 kilometres (3 mi) south of the village of Selamiyah (Arabic: السلامية), in the Nineveh Plains in Upper Mesopotamia. It was a major Assyrian city between approximately 1350 BC and 610 BC. The city is located in a strategic position 10 kilometres (6 mi) north of the point that the river Tigris meets its tributary the Great Zab. The city covered an area of 360 hectares (890 acres). The ruins of the city were found within one kilometre (1,100 yd) of the modern-day Assyrian village of Noomanea in Nineveh Governorate, Iraq.\nThe name Nimrud was recorded as the local name by Carsten Niebuhr in the mid-18th century. In the mid 19th century, biblical archaeologists proposed the Assyrian name Kalḫu (the Biblical Calah), based on a description of the travels of Nimrod in Genesis 10.\nArchaeological excavations at the site began in 1845, and were conducted at intervals between then and 1879, and then from 1949 onwards. Many important pieces were discovered, with most being moved to museums in Iraq and abroad. In 2013, the UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council funded the \"Nimrud Project\", directed by Eleanor Robson, whose aims were to write the history of the city in ancient and modern times, to identify and record the dispersal history of artefacts from Nimrud, distributed amongst at least 76 museums worldwide (including 36 in the United States and 13 in the United Kingdom).\nIn 2015, the terrorist organization Islamic State announced its intention to destroy the site because of its \"un-Islamic\" Assyrian nature. In March 2015, the Iraqi government reported that Islamic State had used bulldozers to destroy excavated remains of the city. Several videos released by ISIL showed the work in progress. In November 2016, Iraqi forces retook the site, and later visitors also confirmed that around 90% of the excavated portion of city had been completely destroyed. The ruins of Nimrud have remained guarded by Iraqi forces ever since. Reconstruction work is in progress.\n\nHistory\nKalhu was located on a prosperous route and was built of an earlier business community under Shalmaneser I in the 13th century BC. Through the centuries, it was in disrepair. In the 9th century BC Ashurnasirpal II ordered the removal of debris from the towers and walls and began the construction of a capital of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. This city would have a royal mansion of superior size, larger than previous monarchs'. \nIn addition to enormous city walls 7.5 kilometers (4.6 miles) long, palaces, temples, royal offices and various residential buildings, Ashurnasirpal also established botanical gardens, filled with foreign plants brought back from his wide-ranging campaigns, and a zoo, perhaps the first large zoo ever constructed. Ashurnasirpal's inscriptions offer no motive for changing the capital. Various explanations have been proposed by modern scholars, including that he might have gotten disenchanted with Assur since there was little room left in the ancient capital to leave a mark, the important position of Nimrud in regard to local trade networks, that Nimrud was more centrally located in the empire, or that Ashurnasirpal hoped for greater independence from the influential great families of Assur.\nA grand opening ceremony with festivities and an opulent banquet in 864 BC is described in an inscribed stele discovered during archeological excavations. To celebrate the completion of his work in Nimrud in 864 BC, Ashurnasirpal hosted a grand celebration, which some scholars have described as perhaps the greatest party in world history; the event hosted 69,574 guests, including 16,000 citizens of the new capital and 5,000 foreign dignitaries, and lasted for ten days. Among the food and beverage used, Ashurnasirpal's inscriptions record 10,000 pigeons, 10,000 jugs of beer, and 10,000 skins of wine, among countless other items.\nBy 800 BC Nimrud had grown to 75,000 inhabitants making it the largest city in the world. The kings of Assyria continued to be buried in Assur, but their queens were buried in Kalhu. \nKalhu is known today as Nimrud because the archaeologists of the 19th and 20th centuries gave it that name, believing it was the legendary city of the biblical Nimrod, which is mentioned in the Book of Genesis.\nKing Ashurnasirpal's son Shalmaneser III (858–823 BC) continued where his father had left off. At Nimrud he built a palace that far surpassed his father's. It was twice the size and it covered an area of about 5 hectares (12 acres) and included more than 200 rooms. He built the monument known as the Great Ziggurat, and an associated temple.\nNimrud remained the capital of the Assyrian Empire during the reigns of Shamshi-Adad V (822–811 BC), Adad-nirari III (810–782 BC), Queen Semiramis (810–806 BC), Adad-nirari III (806–782 BC), Shalmaneser IV (782–773 BC), Ashur-dan III (772–755 BC), Ashur-nirari V (754–746 BC), Tiglath-Pileser III (745–727 BC) and Shalmaneser V (726–723 BC). Tiglath-Pileser III in particular, conducted major building works in the city, as well as introducing Eastern Aramaic as the lingua franca of the empire, whose dialects still endure among the Christian Assyrians of the region today.\nHowever, in 706 BC Sargon II (722–705 BC) moved the capital of the empire to Dur Sharrukin, and after his death, Sennacherib (705–681 BC) moved it to Nineveh. It remained a major city and a royal residence until the city was largely destroyed during the Medo-Babylonian conquest of the Assyrian Empire (between 626 BC and 609 BC).\n\nLater geographical writings\nRuins of a similarly located Assyrian city named \"Larissa\" were described by Xenophon in his Anabasis in the 5th century BC.\nA similar locality was described in the Middle Ages by a number of Arabic geographers including Yaqut al-Hamawi, Abu'l-Fida and Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi, using the name \"Athur\" (meaning Assyria) near Selamiyah.\n\nArchaeology\nEarly writings and debate over name\nNimrud\nThe name Nimrud in connection with the site in Western writings was first used in the travelogue of Carsten Niebuhr, who was in Mosul in March 1760. Niebuhr \n\nIn 1830, traveller James Silk Buckingham wrote of \"two heaps called Nimrod-Tuppé and Shah-Tuppé... The Nimrod-Tuppé has a tradition attached to it, of a palace having been built there by Nimrod\".\nHowever, the name became the cause of significant debate amongst Assyriologists in the mid-nineteenth century, with much of the discussion focusing on the identification of four Biblical cities mentioned in Genesis 10: \"From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, the city Rehoboth-Ir, Calah and Resen\".\n\nLarissa / Resen\nThe site was described in more detail by the British traveler Claudius James Rich in 1820, shortly before his death. Rich identified the site with the city of Larissa in Xenophon, and noted that the locals \"generally believe this to have been Nimrod's own city; and one or two of the better informed with whom I conversed at Mousul said it was Al Athur or Ashur, from which the whole country was denominated.\"\nThe site of Nimrud was visited by William Francis Ainsworth in 1837. Ainsworth, like Rich, identified the site with Larissa (Λάρισσα) of Xenophon's Anabasis, concluding that Nimrud was the Biblical Resen on the basis of Bochart's identification of Larissa with Resen on etymological grounds.\n\nRehoboth\nThe site was subsequently visited by James Phillips Fletcher in 1843. Fletcher instead identified the site with Rehoboth on the basis that the city of Birtha described by Ptolemy and Ammianus Marcellinus has the same etymological meaning as Rehoboth in Hebrew.\n\nAshur\nSir Henry Rawlinson mentioned that the Arabic geographers referred to it as Athur. British traveler Claudius James Rich mentions, \"one or two of the better informed with whom I conversed at Mosul said it was Al Athur or Ashur, from which the whole country was denominated.\"\n\nNineveh\nPrior to 1850, Layard believed that the site of \"Nimroud\" was part of the wider region of \"Nineveh\" (the debate as to which excavation site represented the city of Nineveh had yet to be resolved), which also included the two mounds today identified as Nineveh-proper, and his excavation publications were thus labeled.\n\nCalah\nHenry Rawlinson identified the city with the Biblical Calah on the basis of a cuneiform reading of \"Levekh\" which he connected to the city following Ainsworth and Rich's connection of Xenophon's Larissa to the site.\n\nExcavations\nInitial excavations at Nimrud were conducted by Austen Henry Layard, working from 1845 to 1847 and from 1849 until 1851. Following Layard's departure, the work was handed over to Hormuzd Rassam in 1853-54 and then William Loftus in 1854–55.\nAfter George Smith briefly worked the site in 1873 and Rassam returned there from 1877 to 1879, Nimrud was left untouched for almost 60 years.\nA British School of Archaeology in Iraq team led by Max Mallowan resumed digging at Nimrud in 1949; these excavations resulted in the discovery of the 244 Nimrud Letters. The work continued until 1963 with David Oates becoming director in 1958 followed by Julian Orchard in 1963.\n\nSubsequent work was by the Directorate of Antiquities of the Republic of Iraq (1956, 1959–60, 1969–78 and 1982–92), the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw directed by Janusz Meuszyński (1974–76), Paolo Fiorina (1987–89) with the Centro Ricerche Archeologiche e Scavi di Torino who concentrated mainly on Fort Shalmaneser, and John Curtis (1989). In 1974 to his untimely death in 1976 Janusz Meuszyński, the director of the Polish project, with the permission of the Iraqi excavation team, had the whole site documented on film—in slide film and black-and-white print film. Every relief that remained in situ, as well as the fallen, broken pieces that were distributed in the rooms across the site were photographed. Meuszyński also arranged with the architect of his project, Richard P. Sobolewski, to survey the site and record it in plan and in elevation. As a result, the entire relief compositions were reconstructed, taking into account the presumed location of the fragments that were scattered around the world.\nExcavations revealed remarkable bas-reliefs, ivories, and sculptures. A statue of Ashurnasirpal II was found in an excellent state of preservation, as were colossal winged man-headed lions weighing 10 short tons (9.1 t) to 30 short tons (27 t) each guarding the palace entrance. The large number of inscriptions dealing with king Ashurnasirpal II provide more details about him and his reign than are known for any other ruler of this epoch. The palaces of Ashurnasirpal II, Shalmaneser III, and Tiglath-Pileser III have been located. Portions of the site have been also been identified as temples to Ninurta and Enlil, a building assigned to Nabu, the god of writing and the arts, and as extensive fortifications.\n\nIn 1988, the Iraqi Department of Antiquities discovered four queens' tombs at the site.\n\nArtworks\nNimrud has been one of the main sources of Assyrian sculpture, including the famous palace reliefs. Layard discovered more than half a dozen pairs of colossal guardian figures guarding palace entrances and doorways. These are lamassu, statues with a male human head, the body of a lion or bull, and wings. They have heads carved in the round, but the body at the side is in relief. They weigh up to 27 tonnes (30 short tons). In 1847 Layard brought two of the colossi weighing 9 tonnes (10 short tons) each including one lion and one bull to London. After 18 months and several near disasters he succeeded in bringing them to the British Museum. This involved loading them onto a wheeled cart. They were lowered with a complex system of pulleys and levers operated by dozens of men. The cart was towed by 300 men. He initially tried to hook up the cart to a team of buffalo and have them haul it. However the buffalo refused to move. Then they were loaded onto a barge which required 600 goatskins and sheepskins to keep it afloat. After arriving in London a ramp was built to haul them up the steps and into the museum on rollers.\nAdditional 27-tonne (30-short-ton) colossi were transported to Paris from Khorsabad by Paul Emile Botta in 1853. In 1928 Edward Chiera also transported a 36-tonne (40-short-ton) colossus from Khorsabad to Chicago. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has another pair.\n\nThe Statue of Ashurnasirpal II, Stela of Shamshi-Adad V and Stela of Ashurnasirpal II are large sculptures with portraits of these monarchs, all secured for the British Museum by Layard and the British archaeologist Hormuzd Rassam. Also in the British Museum is the famous Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III, discovered by Layard in 1846. This stands six-and-a-half-feet tall and commemorates with inscriptions and 24 relief panels the king's victorious campaigns of 859–824 BC. It is shaped like a temple tower at the top, ending in three steps.\nSeries of the distinctive Assyrian shallow reliefs were removed from the palaces and sections are now found in several museums (see gallery below), in particular the British Museum. These show scenes of hunting, warfare, ritual and processions. The Nimrud Ivories are a large group of ivory carvings, probably mostly originally decorating furniture and other objects, that had been brought to Nimrud from several parts of the ancient Near East, and were in a palace storeroom and other locations. These are mainly in the British Museum and the National Museum of Iraq, as well as other museums. Another storeroom held the Nimrud Bowls, about 120 large bronze bowls or plates, also imported.\nThe \"Treasure of Nimrud\" unearthed in these excavations is a collection of 613 pieces of gold jewelry and precious stones. It has survived the confusions and looting after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 in a bank vault, where it had been put away for 12 years and was \"rediscovered\" on June 5, 2003.\n\nSignificant inscriptions\nOne panel of the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III has an inscription which includes the name mIa-ú-a mar mHu-um-ri-i While Rawlinson originally translated this in 1850 as \"Yahua, son of Hubiri\", a year later Reverend Edward Hincks, suggested that it refers to King Jehu of Israel (2 Kings 9:2 ff. While other interpretations exist, the obelisk is widely viewed by biblical archaeologists as therefore including the earliest known dedication of an Israelite. Note: all the kings of Israel were called \"sons of Omri\" by the Assyrians (\"mar\" means \"son\").\nA number of other artifacts considered important to Biblical history were excavated from the site, such as the Nimrud Tablet K.3751 and the Nimrud Slab. The bilingual Assyrian lion weights were important to scholarly deduction of the history of the alphabet.\n\nDestruction\nNimrud's various monuments had faced threats from exposure to the harsh elements of the Iraqi climate. Lack of proper protective roofing meant that the ancient reliefs at the site were susceptible to erosion from wind-blown sand and strong seasonal rains.\nIn mid-2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) occupied the area surrounding Nimrud. ISIL destroyed other holy sites, including the Mosque of the Prophet Jonah in Mosul. In early 2015, they announced their intention to destroy many ancient artifacts, which they deemed idolatrous or otherwise un-Islamic; they subsequently destroyed thousands of books and manuscripts in Mosul's libraries. In February 2015, ISIL destroyed Akkadian monuments in the Mosul Museum, and on March 5, 2015, Iraq announced that ISIL militants had bulldozed Nimrud and its archaeological site on the basis that they were blasphemous.\nA member of ISIL filmed the destruction, declaring, \"These ruins that are behind me, they are idols and statues that people in the past used to worship instead of Allah. The Prophet Muhammad took down idols with his bare hands when he went into Mecca. We were ordered by our prophet to take down idols and destroy them, and the companions of the prophet did this after this time, when they conquered countries.\" ISIL declared an intention to destroy the restored city gates in Nineveh. ISIL went on to do demolition work at the later Parthian ruined city of Hatra. On April 12 2015, an online militant video purportedly showed ISIL militants hammering, bulldozing, and ultimately using explosives to blow up parts of Nimrud.\nIrina Bokova, the director general of UNESCO, stated \"deliberate destruction of cultural heritage constitutes a war crime\". The president of the Syriac League in Lebanon compared the losses at the site to the destruction of culture by the Mongol Empire. In November 2016, aerial photographs showed the systematic leveling of the Ziggurat by heavy machines. On 13 November 2016, the Iraqi Army recaptured the city from ISIL. The Joint Operations Command stated that it had raised the Iraqi flag above its buildings and also captured the Assyrian village of Numaniya, on the edge of the town. By the time Nimrud was retaken, around 90% of the excavated part of the city had been destroyed entirely. Every major structure had been damaged, the Ziggurat of Nimrud had been flattened, only a few scattered broken walls remained of the palace of Ashurnasirpal II, the Lamassu that once guarded its gates had been smashed and scattered across the landscape.\n\nReconstruction of the site\nA renovation program started in July 2017 with the support of UNESCO. The first phase included conducting studies of the damage caused to the site, assembling an Iraqi maintenance and rehabilitation team, preservation and archiving of the city's cultural heritage in co-operation with the American Smithsonian Institution. Phase 2 was launched in October 2019 with the goal to restore the northern palace.\nAs of 2020, archaeologists from the Nimrud Rescue Project have carried out two seasons of work at the site, training native Iraqi archaeologists on protecting heritage and helping preserve the remains. Plans for reconstruction and tourism are in the works but will likely not be implemented within the next decade. The first major excavation works, launched in mid-October 2022 by an excavation team from the University of Pennsylvania, reported the discovery of a door sill slab with inscriptions in December.\n\nSecurity post Islamic State\nFollowing the liberation from Islamic State, the security of the ancient city is run by the ethnic Assyrian security force Nineveh Plain Protection Units.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nCities of the ancient Near East\nHatra\nIslamic Iconoclasm\nNimrud lens\nShort chronology timeline\n\nNotes\nCitations\nGeneral references\nFrankfort, Henri, The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient, Pelican History of Art, 4th ed 1970, Penguin (now Yale History of Art), ISBN 0140561072\nA.

          "summary": "Nimrud (; Syriac: ܢܢܡܪܕ Arabic: النمرود) is an ancient Assyrian city (original Assyrian name Kalḫu, biblical name Calah) located in Iraq, 30 kilometres (20 mi) south of the city of Mosul, and 5 kilometres (3 mi) south of the village of Selamiyah (Arabic: السلامية), in the Nineveh Plains in Upper Mesopotamia. It was a major Assyrian city between approximately 1350 BC and 610 BC. The city is located in a strategic position 10 kilometres (6 mi) north of the point that the river Tigris meets its tributary the Great Zab. The city covered an area of 360 hectares (890 acres). The ruins of the city were found within one kilometre (1,100 yd) of the modern-day Assyrian village of Noomanea in Nineveh Governorate, Iraq.\nThe name Nimrud was recorded as the local name by Carsten Niebuhr in the mid-18th century. In the mid 19th century, biblical archaeologists proposed the Assyrian name Kalḫu (the Biblical Calah), based on a description of the travels of Nimrod in Genesis 10.\nArchaeological excavations at the site began in 1845, and were conducted at intervals between then and 1879, and then from 1949 onwards. Many important pieces were discovered, with most being moved to museums in Iraq and abroad. In 2013, the UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council funded the \"Nimrud Project\", directed by Eleanor Robson, whose aims were to write the history of the city in ancient and modern times, to identify and record the dispersal history of artefacts from Nimrud, distributed amongst at least 76 museums worldwide (including 36 in the United States and 13 in the United Kingdom).\nIn 2015, the terrorist organization Islamic State announced its intention to destroy the site because of its \"un-Islamic\" Assyrian nature. In March 2015, the Iraqi government reported that Islamic State had used bulldozers to destroy excavated remains of the city. Several videos released by ISIL showed the work in progress. In November 2016, Iraqi forces retook the site, and later visitors also confirmed that around 90% of the excavated portion of city had been completely destroyed. The ruins of Nimrud have remained guarded by Iraqi forces ever since. Reconstruction work is in progress.",

          "title": "Nineveh",
          "content": "Nineveh was an ancient Near Eastern city of Upper Mesopotamia, located in the modern-day city of Mosul in northern Iraq. It is located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River and was the capital and largest city of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Today, it is a common name for the half of Mosul that lies on the eastern bank of the Tigris, and the country's Nineveh Governorate takes its name from it.\nIt was the largest city in the world for approximately fifty years until the year 612 BC when, after a bitter period of civil war in Assyria, it was sacked by a coalition of its former subject peoples including the Babylonians, Medes, and Scythians. The city was never again a political or administrative centre, but by Late Antiquity it was the seat of an Assyrian Christian bishop of the Assyrian Church of the East. It declined relative to Mosul during the Middle Ages and was mostly abandoned by the 14th century AD after the massacres and dispersal of Assyrian Christians by Timur.\nIts ruins lie across the river from the historical city center of Mosul. The two main tells, or mound-ruins, within the walls are Tell Kuyunjiq and Tell Nabī Yūnus, site of a shrine to Jonah. According to the Hebrew Bible and the Quran, Jonah was a prophet who preached to Nineveh. Large numbers of Assyrian sculptures and other artifacts have been excavated from the ruins of Nineveh, and are now located in museums around the world.\n\nThe location of Nineveh was known, to some, continuously through the Middle Ages. Benjamin of Tudela visited it in 1170; Petachiah of Regensburg soon after.\n\nName\nThe English placename Nineveh comes from the Latin Nīnevē and the Koine Greek Nineuḗ (Νινευή) under influence of the Biblical Hebrew Nīnəweh (נִינְוֶה), from the Akkadian Ninua (var. Ninâ) or Ninuwā. The city was also known as Ninuwa in Mari; Ninawa in Aramaic; Ninwe (ܢܸܢܘܵܐ) in Syriac; and Ninawa (نینوا) in Arabic.\n\nNabī Yūnus is the Arabic for \"Prophet Jonah\". Kuyunjiq was, according to Layard, a Turkish name (Layard used the form kouyunjik, diminutive of koyun \"sheep\" in Turkish); known as Armousheeah by the Arabs, it is thought to have some connection with the Qara Qoyunlu dynasty.\n\nGeography\nThe remains of ancient Nineveh, the areas of Kuyunjiq and Nabī Yūnus with their mounds, are located on a level part of the plain at the junction of the Tigris and the Khosr Rivers within an area of 750 hectares (1,900 acres) circumscribed by a 12-kilometre (7.5 mi) fortification wall. This whole extensive space is now one immense area of ruins, roughly a third of these overlaid by the Nebi Yunus suburbs of the city of eastern Mosul.\nThe site of ancient Nineveh is bisected by the Khosr river. North of the Khosr, the site is called Kuyunjiq, including the acropolis of Tell Kuyunjiq; the illegal village of Rahmaniye lay in eastern Kuyunjiq. South of the Khosr, the urbanized area is called Nebi Yunus (also Ghazliya, Jezayr, Jammasa), including Tell Nebi Yunus, where are the mosque of the Prophet Jonah, and a palace of Esarhaddon/Ashurbanipal below it. South of the street Al-'Asady (made by Daesh by destroying swaths of the city walls) the area is called Junub Ninawah or Shara Pepsi.\n\nHistory\nNeolithic\nNineveh itself was founded as early as 6000 BC during the late Neolithic period. Deep sounding at Nineveh uncovered soil layers that have been dated to early in the era of the Hassuna archaeological culture. The development and culture of Nineveh paralleled Tepe Gawra and Tell Arpachiyah a few kilometers to the northeast. Nineveh was a typical farming village in the Halaf Period.\n\nChalcolithic\nUbaid period\nIn 5000 BC, Nineveh transitioned from a Halaf village to an Ubaid village. During the Late Chalcolithic period Nineveh was one of the few Ubaid villages in Upper Mesopotamia which became a proto-city. Others include Ugarit, Brak, Hamoukar, Arbela, Alep, and regionally Susa, Eridu, Nippur. During the period between 4500 and 4000 BC it grew to 40 hectares in size.\nThe greater Nineveh area is notable in the diffusion of metal technology across the near east as the first location outside of Anatolia to smelt copper. Tell Arpachiyah has the oldest copper smelting remains, and Tepe Gawra has the oldest metal work. The copper came from the mines at Ergani.\n\nUruk period\nNineveh IV became a trade colony of Uruk during the Uruk Expansion because of its location as the highest navigable point on the Tigris. It was contemporary with, and had a similar function to, Habuba Kabira on the Euphrates. Finds included beveled rim bowls.\n\nEarly Bronze Age\nNinevite 5 period\nThe regional influence of Nineveh became particularly pronounced during the archaeological period known as Ninevite 5, or Ninevite V (3000/2900–2600/2500 BC). This period is defined primarily by the characteristic pottery that is found widely throughout Upper Mesopotamia. Also, for the Upper Mesopotamian region, the Early Jezirah chronology has been developed by archaeologists. According to this regional chronology, 'Ninevite 5' is equivalent to the Early Jezirah I–II period.\n\nNinevite 5 was preceded by the Late Uruk period. Ninevite 5 pottery is roughly contemporary to the Early Transcaucasian culture ware, and the Jemdet Nasr period ware. Iraqi Scarlet Ware culture also belongs to this period; this colourful painted pottery is somewhat similar to Jemdet Nasr ware. Scarlet Ware was first documented in the Diyala River basin in Iraq. Later, it was also found in the nearby Hamrin Basin, and in Luristan. It is also contemporary with the Proto-Elamite period in Susa.\nNinevite 5 can be subdivided into the Early Ninevite 5 (3000-2750 BC) characterized by painted pottery and Late Ninevite 5 (2750-2500 BC) with incised pottery. In southern Mesopotamia, the former is contemporary with ED I-II, while the latter mirrors ED II-IIIA.\n\nAkkadian period\nIn the late 3rd millennium BC Nineveh was part of the Akkadian Empire. While the site was occupied in that period, there was minimal official Akkadian presence there—unlike at Assur which had a much more notable presence. An Akkadian period bronze statue head found at Nineveh was later determined to be a 7th century addition.\n\nMiddle Bronze\nIn the early 2nd millennium BC Nineveh became part of the Kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia during the reign of Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1809–1775 BC), Amorite ruler of Ekallatum. It became a center of worship of Ishtar.\n\nLate Bronze\nMitanni period\nThe goddess's statue was sent to Pharaoh Amenhotep III of Egypt in the 14th century BC, by orders of the king Tushratta of Mitanni. Nineveh became one of Mitanni's vassals for half a century until the early 14th century BC.\n\nMiddle Assyrian period\nThe Assyrian king Ashur-uballit I reclaimed it in 1365 BC while overthrowing the Mitanni Empire and creating the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365–1050 BC).\nThere is a large body of evidence to show that Assyrian monarchs built extensively in Nineveh during the late 3rd and 2nd millennia BC; it appears to have been originally an \"Assyrian provincial town\". Later monarchs whose inscriptions have appeared on the high city include the Middle Assyrian Empire kings Shalmaneser I (1274–1245 BC) and Tiglath-Pileser I (1114–1076 BC), both of whom were active builders in Assur (Ashur).\n\nIron Age\nNeo-Assyrian period\nDuring the Neo-Assyrian Empire, particularly from the time of Ashurnasirpal II (ruled 883–859 BC) onward, there was considerable architectural expansion. Successive monarchs such as Tiglath-pileser III, Sargon II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal maintained and founded new palaces, as well as temples to Sîn, Ashur, Nergal, Shamash, Ninurta, Ishtar, Tammuz, Nisroch and Nabu.\nThe Hebrew Book of Jonah, which was most likely written between 793 and 758 BC, is an account of the city's repentance and Jehovah's mercy which prevented destruction.\n\nSennacherib's development of Nineveh\nIt was Sennacherib who made Nineveh a truly influential city (c. 700 BC), as he laid out new streets and squares, and built within it the South West Palace, or \"palace without a rival\", the plan of which has been mostly recovered and has overall dimensions of about 503 by 242 metres (1,650 ft × 794 ft). It had at least 80 rooms, many of which were lined with sculpture. A large number of cuneiform tablets were found in the palace. The solid foundation was made out of limestone blocks and mud bricks; it was 22 metres (72 ft) tall. In total, the foundation is made of roughly 2,680,000 cubic metres (3,505,308 cu yd) of brick (approximately 160 million bricks). The walls on top, made out of mud brick, were an additional 20 metres (66 ft) tall.\nSome of the principal doorways were flanked by colossal stone lamassu door figures weighing up to 30,000 kilograms (30 t); these were winged Mesopotamian lions or bulls, with human heads. These were transported 50 kilometres (31 mi) from quarries at Balatai, and they had to be lifted up 20 metres (66 ft) once they arrived at the site, presumably by a ramp. There are also 3,000 metres (9,843 ft) of stone Assyrian palace reliefs, that include pictorial records documenting every construction step including carving the statues and transporting them on a barge. One picture shows 44 men towing a colossal statue. The carving shows three men directing the operation while standing on the Colossus. Once the statues arrived at their destination, the final carving was done. Most of the statues weigh between 9,000 and 27,000 kilograms (19,842 and 59,525 lb).\nThe stone carvings in the walls include many battle scenes, impalings and scenes showing Sennacherib's men parading the spoils of war before him. The inscriptions boasted of his conquests: he wrote of Babylon: \"Its inhabitants, young and old, I did not spare, and with their corpses I filled the streets of the city.\" A full and characteristic set shows the campaign leading up to the siege of Lachish in 701 BC; it is the \"finest\" from the reign of Sennacherib, and now in the British Museum. He later wrote about a battle in Lachish: \"And Hezekiah of Judah who had not submitted to my yoke ... him I shut up in Jerusalem his royal city like a caged bird. Earthworks I threw up against him, and anyone coming out of his city gate I made pay for his crime. His cities which I had plundered I had cut off from his land.\"\nAt this time, Nineveh comprised about 7 square kilometres (1,730 acres) of land, and fifteen great gates penetrated its walls. An elaborate system of eighteen canals brought water from the hills to Nineveh, and several sections of a magnificently constructed aqueduct erected by Sennacherib were discovered at Jerwan, about 65 kilometres (40 mi) distant. The enclosed area had more than 100,000 inhabitants (maybe closer to 150,000), about twice as many as Babylon at the time, placing it among the largest settlements worldwide.\nSome scholars such as Stephanie Dalley at Oxford believe that the garden Sennacherib built next to his palace, with its associated irrigation works, was the original Hanging Gardens of Babylon; Dalley's argument is based on a disputation of the traditional placement of the Hanging Gardens attributed to Berossus, together with a combination of literary and archaeological evidence.\n\nAfter Ashurbanipal\nThe greatness of Nineveh was short-lived. In around 627 BC, after the death of its last great king Ashurbanipal, the Neo-Assyrian Empire began to unravel through a series of bitter civil wars between rival claimants for the throne, and in 616 BC Assyria was attacked by its own former vassals, the Chaldeans, Babylonians, Medes, and Scythians. In about 616 BC Kalhu was sacked, the allied forces eventually reached Nineveh, besieging and sacking the city in 612 BC, following bitter house-to-house fighting, after which it was razed. Most of the people in the city who could not escape to the last Assyrian strongholds in the north and west were either massacred or deported out of the city and into the countryside where they founded new settlements. Many unburied skeletons were found by the archaeologists at the site. The Assyrian Empire then came to an end by 605 BC, the Medes and Babylonians dividing its colonies between themselves.\nIt is not clear whether Nineveh came under the rule of the Medes or the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 612. The Babylonian Chronicles concerning the Fall of Nineveh record that Nineveh was \"turned into mounds and heaps\", but this is literary hyperbole. The complete destruction of Nineveh has traditionally been seen as confirmed by the Hebrew Book of Ezekiel and the Greek Retreat of the Ten Thousand of Xenophon (d. 354 BC). There are no later cuneiform tablets in Akkadian from Nineveh. Although devastated in 612 BC, the city was not completely abandoned. Yet, to the Greek historians Ctesias and Herodotus (c. 400 BC), Nineveh was a thing of the past; and when Xenophon passed the place in the 4th century BC he described it as abandoned.\n\nPersian period\nThe earliest piece of written evidence for the persistence of Nineveh as a settlement is possibly the Cyrus Cylinder of 539/538 BC, but the reading of this is disputed. If correctly read as Nineveh, it indicates that Cyrus the Great restored the temple of Ishtar at Nineveh and probably encouraged resettlement. A number of cuneiform Elamite tablets have been found at Nineveh. They probably date from the time of the revival of Elam in the century following the collapse of Assyria.\nArchaeologically, there is evidence of repairs at the temple of Nabu after 612 BC and for the continued use of Sennacherib's palace. There is evidence of syncretic Hellenistic cults. A statue of Hermes has been found and a Greek inscription attached to a shrine of the Sebitti. A statue of Herakles Epitrapezios dated to the 2nd century AD has also been found.\n\nClassical period\nThe city was actively resettled under the Seleucid Empire. There is evidence of more changes in Sennacherib's palace under the Parthian Empire. The Parthians also established a municipal mint at Nineveh coining in bronze. According to Tacitus, in AD 50 Meherdates, a claimant to the Parthian throne with Roman support, took Nineveh.\n\nLate Antiquity\nBy Late Antiquity, Nineveh was restricted to the east bank of the Tigris and the west bank was uninhabited. Under the Sasanian Empire, Nineveh was not an administrative centre. By the 2nd century AD there were Christians present and by 554 it was a bishopric of the Church of the East. King Khosrow II (591–628) built a fortress on the west bank, and two Christian monasteries were constructed around 570 and 595. This growing settlement was not called Mosul until after the Arab conquests. It may have been called Hesnā ʿEbrāyē (Jews' Fort).\nIn 627, the city was the site of the Battle of Nineveh between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Sasanians. In 641, it was conquered by the Arabs, who built a mosque on the west bank and turned it into an administrative centre. Under the Umayyad dynasty, Mosul eclipsed Nineveh, which was reduced to a Christian suburb with limited new construction. By the 13th century, Nineveh was mostly ruins and was subsequently absorbed into Mosul. A church was converted into a Muslim shrine to the prophet Jonah, which continued to attract pilgrims until its destruction by ISIL in 2014. In late Ottoman times, the ashlar masonry of the North Palace of Ashurbanipal was quarried to make for the pilons of the Old Bridge over the Tigris. The modern city of Mosul is occasionally referred to as Nineveh, such as during the operation to retake Mosul in 2016–17.\n\nBiblical Nineveh\nIn the Hebrew Bible, Nineveh is first mentioned in Genesis 10:11: \"Ashur left that land, and built Nineveh\". Some modern English translations interpret \"Ashur\" in the Hebrew of this verse as the country \"Assyria\" rather than a person, thus making Nimrod, rather than Ashur, the founder of Nineveh. The discovery of the fifteen Jubilees texts found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls has since shown that, according to the Jewish sects of Qumran, Genesis 10:11 affirms the apportionment of Nineveh to Ashur.\n\nAccording to Isaiah 37:37–38 Nineveh was also the place where Sennacherib died at the hands of his two sons, who then fled to Ararat. The book of the minor prophet Nahum is almost exclusively taken up with prophetic denunciations against Nineveh. Its ruin and utter desolation are foretold in Nahum 1:14 and Nahum 3:19. In Nahum 2:6–11 its end was fortold to be strange, sudden, and tragic. According to Isaiah 10:5–19 it was God's doing, his judgment on Assyria's pride. In fulfillment of prophecy, God made \"an utter end of the place\". It became a \"desolation\". In Zephaniah 2:13–15 the minor prophet Zephaniah also predicts its destruction along with the fall of the empire of which it was the capital. Nineveh is also the setting of the Book of Tobit.\nThe Book of Jonah (Jonah 3:3 and Jonah 4:11), set in the days of the Assyrian Empire, describes it as an \"exceedingly great city of three days' journey in breadth\", whose population at that time is given as \"more than 120,000\". Genesis 10:11–12 lists four cities \"Nineveh, Rehoboth, Calah, and Resen\", ambiguously stating that either Resen or Calah is \"the great city\". The ruins of Kuyunjiq, Nimrud, Karamlesh and Khorsabad form the four corners of an irregular quadrilateral. The ruins of the \"great city\" Nineveh, with the whole area included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn from the one to the other, are generally regarded as consisting of these four sites. The description of Nineveh in Jonah likely was a reference to greater Nineveh, including the surrounding cities of Rehoboth, Calah and Resen The Book of Jonah depicts Nineveh as a wicked city worthy of destruction. God sent Jonah to preach to the Ninevites of their coming destruction, and they fasted and repented because of this. As a result, God spared the city; when Jonah protests against this, God states he is showing mercy for the population who, according to Jonah 4:11), are ignorant of the difference between right and wrong (\"who cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand\" and mercy for the beasts in the city.\nNineveh's repentance and salvation from evil can be found in the Hebrew Tanakh, also known as the Old Testament, and referred to in Matthew 12:41 and Luke 11:32 and Muslim Quran. To this day, Syriac and Oriental Orthodox churches commemorate the three days Jonah spent inside the fish during the Fast of Nineveh. Some Christians observe this holiday fast by refraining from food and drink, with churches encouraging followers to refrain from dairy products, fish and other meats.\n\nArchaeology\nCarsten Niebuhr recorded its location during the 1761–1767 Danish expedition. Niebuhr wrote afterwards that \"I did not learn that I was at so remarkable a spot, till near the river. Then they showed me a village on a great hill, which they call Nunia, and a mosque, in which the prophet Jonah was buried. Another hill in this district is called Kalla Nunia, or the Castle of Nineveh. On that lies a village Koindsjug.\" In 1820 the site was explored and described by archaeologist Claudius Rich. In 1842, the French Consul General at Mosul, Paul-Émile Botta, began to search the vast mounds that lay along the opposite bank of the river. While at Tell Kuyunjiq he had little success, the locals whom he employed in these excavations, to their great surprise, came upon the ruins of a building at the 20 km far-away mound of Khorsabad, which, on further exploration, turned out to be the royal palace of Sargon II, in which large numbers of reliefs were found and recorded, though they had been damaged by fire and were mostly too fragile to remove.\n\nIn 1847 the young British diplomat Austen Henry Layard explored the ruins. Layard did not use modern archaeological methods; his stated goal was \"to obtain the largest possible number of well preserved objects of art at the least possible outlay of time and money\". In the Kuyunjiq mound, Layard rediscovered in 1849 the lost palace of Sennacherib with its 71 rooms and colossal bas-reliefs. He also unearthed the palace and famous library of Ashurbanipal with 22,000 cuneiform clay tablets. Most of Layard's material was sent to the British Museum, but some was dispersed elsewhere: two large pieces were given to Lady Charlotte Guest and these eventually found their way to the Metropolitan Museum.\nThe work of exploration was carried on by Hormuzd Rassam, George Smith and others, and a vast treasury of specimens of Assyria was incrementally exhumed for European museums. Palace after palace was discovered, with their decorations and their sculptured slabs, revealing the life and manners of this ancient people, their arts of war and peace, the forms of their religion, the style of their architecture, and the magnificence of their monarchs.\nThe mound of Tell Kuyunjiq was excavated again by the archaeologists of the British Museum, led by Leonard William King, between 1902 and 1904. Their efforts concentrated on the site of the Temple of Nabu where another cuneiform library was supposed to exist. However, no such library was ever found: most likely, it had been destroyed by the activities of later residents.\nThe excavations started again in 1927, under the direction of Campbell Thompson, who had taken part in King's expeditions. Some works were carried out outside Kuyunjiq, for instance on the mound of Tell Nebi Yunus, which was the ancient arsenal of Nineveh, or along the outside walls. Here, near the northwestern corner of the walls, beyond the pavement of a later building, the archaeologists found almost 300 fragments of prisms recording the royal annals of Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal, beside a prism of Esarhaddon which was almost perfect.\nAfter the Second World War, several excavations were carried out by Iraqi archaeologists. From 1951 to 1958, Mohammed Ali Mustafa worked the site. The work was continued from 1967 through 1971 by Tariq Madhloom. Some additional excavation occurred by Manhal Jabur from the early 1970s to 1987. For the most part, these digs focused on Tell Nebi Yunus.\nThe British archaeologist and Assyriologist Professor David Stronach of the University of California, Berkeley conducted a series of surveys and digs at the site from 1987 to 1990, focusing his attentions on the several gates and the existent mudbrick walls, as well as the system that supplied water to the city in times of siege. The excavation reports are in progress.\nAfter Mosul’s liberation from the control of the Islamic State (IS), Peter A. Miglus, University of Heidelberg, established a rescue project in 2018, exploring and documenting the intrusive IS tunnels in the Assyrian Military Palace that is located below the destroyed Mosque of the prophet Jonah on Tell Nebi Yunus. Archaeological excavations have been conducted since 2019. Subsequently, an extensive research project, first under the direction of Stefan M. Maul and now of Aaron Schmidt, University of Heidelberg, developed, focusing also on other areas of Nineveh. At Tell Kuyunjiq, activities started in 2021 with rescue and restoration measures for the destroyed reliefs in the throne room wing of the Southwest Palace. Excavations in the North Palace commenced in 2022. Since 2023, work has also been conducted at the Nergal Gate, which was bulldozed by IS. In the lower town, geophysical surveys were carried out north of Kuyunjiq in 2021 and 2023 in preparation of future research on residential areas.\nAn Iraqi–Italian Archaeological Expedition by the Alma Mater Studiorum – University of Bologna and the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage (SBAH), led by Nicolò Marchetti, began (with five campaigns having taken place between 2019 and 2023) a project aiming at the excavation, conservation and public presentation of the lower town of Nineveh. Work was carried out in nineteen excavation areas, from the Adad Gate – now completely repaired (after removing hundreds of tons of debris from ISIL's 2016 destructions), explored and protected with a new roof – deep into the Nebi Yunus town. In a few areas a thick later stratigraphy was encountered, but the late 7th century BC stratum was reached everywhere (actually in two areas in the pre-Sennacherib lower town the excavations already exposed older strata, up to the 11th century BC until now, aiming in the future at exploring the first settlement therein). In October 2023 an archaeological park was inaugurated at the site.\nSince 2024, an expedition led by Tim Harrison of the ISAC at the University of Chicago has taken over from the University of Bologna the investigation of the eastern lower town at Nineveh.\n\nArchaeological remains\nThe site is marked by two large mounds, Tell Kuyunjiq and Tell Nabī Yūnus \"Prophet Jonah\", and the remains of the city walls (about 12 kilometres (7 mi) in circumference), enclosing a vast lower town extensively encroached by modern buildings. The Neo-Assyrian levels of Kuyunjiq have been extensively explored. The other mound, Nabī Yūnus, has not been as extensively explored because there was an Arab Muslim shrine dedicated to that prophet on the site. On July 24, 2014, the Islamic State destroyed the shrine as part of a campaign to destroy religious sanctuaries it deemed \"un-Islamic\", but also to loot that site through tunneling.\nThe ruin mound of Tell Kuyunjiq rises about 20 metres (66 ft) above the surrounding plain of the ancient city. It is quite broad, measuring about 800 by 500 metres (2,625 ft × 1,640 ft). Its upper layers have been extensively excavated, and several Neo-Assyrian palaces and temples have been found there. A deep sounding by Max Mallowan revealed evidence of habitation as early as the 6th millennium BC. Today, there is little evidence of these old excavations other than weathered pits and earth piles. In 1990, the only Assyrian remains visible were those of the entry court and the first few chambers of the Palace of Sennacherib. Since that time, the palace chambers have received significant damage by looters and by the removal of the protective roof. Portions of relief sculptures that were in the palace chambers in 1990 were seen on the antiquities market by 1996. Photographs of the chambers made in 2003 show that many of the fine relief sculptures there have been reduced to piles of rubble and a conservation effort ensued. In 2016 Sennacherib's throne room was bulldozed by Daesh and the sculpted fragments were left exposed until 2022.\n\nTell Nebi Yunus is located about 1 kilometre (0.6 mi) south of Kuyunjiq and is the secondary ruin mound at Nineveh. On the basis of texts of Sennacherib, the site has traditionally been identified as the \"armory\" of Nineveh, and a gate and pavements excavated by Iraqis in 1954 have been considered to be part of the \"armory\" complex. Excavations in 1990 revealed a monumental entryway consisting of a number of large inscribed orthostats and \"bull-man\" sculptures, some apparently unfinished. Following the liberation of Mosul, the tunnels under Tell Nebi Yunus were explored in 2018, in which a 3000-year-old palace was discovered, including a pair of reliefs, each showing a row of women, along with reliefs of lamassu.\n\nThe ruins of Nineveh are surrounded by the remains of a massive stone and mudbrick wall dating from about 700 BC. About 12 km in length, the wall system consisted of an ashlar stone retaining wall about 6 metres (20 ft) high surmounted by a mudbrick wall about 10 metres (33 ft) high and 15 metres (49 ft) thick. The stone retaining wall had projecting stone towers spaced about every 18 metres (59 ft). The stone wall and towers were topped by three-step merlons.\nSix of the gateways have been explored to some extent by archaeologists (besides the possible Sin Gate at the north-west end of the site):\n\nMashki Gate Masqi Gate (Arabic: بوابة مسقي Derived from the passive participle of سَقَى saqā, \"to give (sb) a drink, to water, to irrigate\") was perhaps used to take livestock to water from the Tigris which currently flows about 1.5 kilometres (0.9 mi) to the west. It has been reconstructed in fortified mudbrick to the height of the top of the vaulted passageway. The Assyrian original may have been plastered and ornamented. It was bulldozed along with the Nergal and Adad Gates during IS occupation. During the restoration project, seven damaged alabaster carvings from the time of Sennacherib were found at the gate in 2022.\nNergal Gate: Named for the god Nergal, it may have been used for some ceremonial purpose, as it is the only known gate flanked by stone sculptures of winged bull-men (lamassu). The reconstruction is conjectural, as the gate was excavated by Layard in the mid-19th century and reconstructed in the mid-20th century. The lamassu on this gate were defaced with a jackhammer by IS forces and the gate was utterly destroyed.\nAdad Gate: Named for the god Adad. A roofing above it was begun in the late 1960s by Iraqis but was not completed. The result was a mixture of concrete and eroding mudbrick, which nonetheless does give some idea of the original structure. The excavator left some features unexcavated, allowing a view of the original Assyrian construction. The original brickwork of the outer vaulted passageway was well exposed, as was the entrance of the vaulted stairway to the upper levels. The actions of Nineveh's last defenders could be seen in the hastily built mudbrick construction which narrowed the passageway from 4 to 2 metres (13 to 7 ft). Around April 13, 2016, IS demolished both the gate and the adjacent wall by flattening them with a bulldozer. It has been reexcavated (including a 7 m deep stair-well), conservated and presented to the public by the Iraqi-Italian expedition between 2019 and 2023.\nShamash Gate: Named for the sun god Shamash, it opens to the road to Erbil. It was excavated by Layard in the 19th century. The stone retaining wall and part of the mudbrick structure were reconstructed in the 1960s. The mudbrick reconstruction has deteriorated significantly. The stone wall projects outward about 20 metres (66 ft) from the line of main wall for a width of about 70 metres (230 ft). It is the only gate with such a significant projection. The mound of its remains towers above the surrounding terrain. Its size and design suggest it was the most important gate in Neo-Assyrian times. It is now being excavated by the University of Chicago expedition.\nHalzi Gate: Near the south end of the eastern city wall. Exploratory excavations were undertaken here by the University of California, Berkeley expedition of 1989–1990 and again in 2022 and 2023 by the Iraqi-Italian Expedition. There is an outward projection of the city wall, though not as pronounced as at the Shamash Gate. The entry passage had been narrowed with mudbrick to about 2 metres (7 ft) as at the Adad Gate. Human remains from the final battle of Nineveh were found in the passageway. Located in the eastern wall, it is the southernmost and largest of all the remaining gates of ancient Nineveh.\nA new gate has been discovered in 2021 to the north of the Shamash Gate and south of the Khosr river (in the area labeled as N by the Iraqi-Italian expedition), next to a spectacular water tunnel running for 42 m under the 31m-thick city wall (area G, excavated in 2020 and 2021).\n\nThreats to the site\nThe site of Nineveh is exposed to decay of its reliefs by a lack of proper protective roofing, vandalism and looting holes dug into chamber floors. Future preservation is further compromised by the site's proximity to expanding suburbs.\nThe ailing Mosul Dam is a persistent threat to Nineveh as well as the city of Mosul. This is in no small part due to years of disrepair (in 2006, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers cited it as the most dangerous dam in the world), the cancellation of a second dam project in the 1980s to act as flood relief in case of failure, and occupation by ISIL in 2014 resulting in fleeing workers and stolen equipment. If the dam fails, the entire site could be under as much as 45 feet (14 m) of water.\nA major threat to Nineveh has been deliberate human actions by ISIL or Daesh, which occupied the area between 2014 and 2017. In early 2015, they first announced their intention to destroy the walls of Nineveh if the Iraqis tried to liberate the city,  and they also threatened the destruction of archaeological heritage and artifacts. On February 26, 2015, video footage shows IS smashing statues and artifacts at the Mosul Museum. They are believed to have plundered others to sell overseas. The items were mostly from the Assyrian exhibit, which Daesh declared blasphemous and idolatrous. There were 300 items remaining in the museum out of a total of 1,900, with the other 1,600 being taken to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad for security reasons prior to the 2014 Fall of Mosul. Some of the artifacts sold and/or destroyed were from Nineveh. Just a few days after the destruction of the museum pieces, Daesh terrorists demolished parts of three other major UNESCO world heritage sites, Khorsabad, Nimrud and Hatra. In 2016, Daesh effectively destroyed the Adad Gate (along with the adjoining northern city walls, now cleared by the Iraqi-Italian expedition thanks to the support of the Kaplan Fund), as well as the Mashki Gate (along with the eastern fortifications. The Mashki Gate is in the process of being restored). Daesh also called for intensive new housing in the Kuyunjiq part and opened a large road across the southern part of the site (currently known as Al Asady Road).\nAfter the cultural destruction and between 2014-2019, international efforts by archeologists began recording, evaluating and monitoring the damage and destruction inflicted on sensitive archaeological contexts in Nineveh, using satellite-based remote sensing. The results found that a few high-profile acts of deliberate vandalism were accompanied by much more extensive damage caused by construction and rubbish dumping extending across substantial parts of the site.\nThanks to the activities of the Iraqi-Italian expedition, an archaeological park has been opened at Kuyunjiq since 2023: tourists enter from the Adad gate, subsequently visiting the small Neo-Assyrian palace where the cuneiform library was discovered in 2021, and may then relax in the VW Foundation-funded KALAM mudbrick information center nearby. The site is still endangered, however, with dumping of debris, illegal settlements and economic activities (such as illegal generators for electricity, pipe companies etc.) as the main threats.\n\nRogation of the Ninevites (Nineveh's Wish)\nMembers of the Ancient Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Syriac Catholic Church, Syriac Orthodox Church, Assyrian Church of the East and Saint Thomas Christians of the Syro-Malabar Church observe a fast called Ba'uta d-Ninwe (ܒܥܘܬܐ ܕܢܝܢܘܐ) which means Nineveh's Prayer. Copts and Ethiopian Orthodox also maintain this fast.\n\nIn popular culture\nEnglish Romantic poet Edwin Atherstone wrote an epic titled The Fall of Nineveh. The work tells of an uprising against king Sardanapalus by all the nations that were dominated by the Assyrian Empire. He is a great criminal who had one hundred prisoners of war executed. After a long struggle, the town is conquered by Median and Babylonian troops, led by prince Arbaces and priest Belesis.

          "summary": "Nineveh was an ancient Near Eastern city of Upper Mesopotamia, located in the modern-day city of Mosul in northern Iraq. It is located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River and was the capital and largest city of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Today, it is a common name for the half of Mosul that lies on the eastern bank of the Tigris, and the country's Nineveh Governorate takes its name from it.\nIt was the largest city in the world for approximately fifty years until the year 612 BC when, after a bitter period of civil war in Assyria, it was sacked by a coalition of its former subject peoples including the Babylonians, Medes, and Scythians. The city was never again a political or administrative centre, but by Late Antiquity it was the seat of an Assyrian Christian bishop of the Assyrian Church of the East. It declined relative to Mosul during the Middle Ages and was mostly abandoned by the 14th century AD after the massacres and dispersal of Assyrian Christians by Timur.\nIts ruins lie across the river from the historical city center of Mosul. The two main tells, or mound-ruins, within the walls are Tell Kuyunjiq and Tell Nabī Yūnus, site of a shrine to Jonah. According to the Hebrew Bible and the Quran, Jonah was a prophet who preached to Nineveh. Large numbers of Assyrian sculptures and other artifacts have been excavated from the ruins of Nineveh, and are now located in museums around the world.\n\nThe location of Nineveh was known, to some, continuously through the Middle Ages. Benjamin of Tudela visited it in 1170; Petachiah of Regensburg soon after.",

          "content": "Samarra (Arabic: سَامَرَّاء, Sāmarrāʾ) is a city in Iraq. It stands on the east bank of the Tigris in the Saladin Governorate, 125 kilometers (78 mi) north of Baghdad. The modern city of Samarra was founded in 836 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mu'tasim as a new administrative capital and military base. In 2003 the city had an estimated population of 348,700. During the Iraqi Civil War (2006–08), Samarra was in the \"Sunni Triangle\" of resistance.\nThe archeological site of Samarra still retains much of the historic city's original plan, architecture and artistic relics. In 2007, UNESCO designated it a World Heritage Site.\n\nHistory\nPrehistoric Samarra\nThe remains of prehistoric Samarra were first excavated between 1911 and 1914 by the German archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld and Friedrich Sarre. Samarra became the type site for the Samarra culture. Since 1946, the notebooks, letters, unpublished excavation reports and photographs have been in the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\nThe civilization flourished alongside the Ubaid period, as one of the first town states in the Near East. It lasted from 5,500 BCE and eventually collapsed in 3,900 BCE.\n\nNeo-Assyrian period\nA city of Sur-marrati (refounded by Sennacherib in 690 BC according to a stele in the Walters Art Museum) is insecurely identified with a fortified Assyrian site at al-Huwaysh on the Tigris opposite modern Samarra. The State Archives of Assyria Online identifies Surimarrat as the modern site of Samarra.\nAncient place names for Samarra noted by the Samarra Archaeological Survey are Greek Souma (Ptolemy V.19, Zosimus III, 30), Latin Sumere, a fort mentioned during the retreat of the army of Julian in 363 AD (Ammianus Marcellinus XXV, 6, 4), and Syriac Sumra (Hoffmann, Auszüge, 188; Michael the Syrian, III, 88), described as a village.\nThe possibility of a larger population was offered by the opening of the Qatul al-Kisrawi, the northern extension of the Nahrawan Canal which drew water from the Tigris in the region of Samarra, attributed by Yaqut al-Hamawi (Muʿjam, see under \"Qatul\") to Khosrau I (531–578). To celebrate the completion of this project, a commemorative tower (modern Burj al-Qa'im) was built at the southern inlet south of Samarra, and a palace with a \"paradise\" or walled hunting park was constructed at the northern inlet (modern Nahr ar-Rasasi) near ad-Dawr.  A supplementary canal, the Qatul Abi al-Jund, excavated by the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid, was commemorated by a planned city laid out in the form of a regular octagon (modern Husn al-Qadisiyya), called al-Mubarak and abandoned unfinished in 796.\n\nAbbasid capital\nIn 836 CE, the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mu'tasim founded a new capital at the banks of the Tigris. Here he built extensive palace complexes surrounded by garrison settlements for his guards, mostly drawn from Central Asia and Iran (most famously the Turks, as well as the Iranian Khurasani Ishtakhaniyya, Faraghina and Ushrusaniyya regiments) or North Africa (like the Maghariba). Although quite often called Mamluk slave soldiers, their status was quite elevated; some of their commanders bore Sogdian titles of nobility.\n\nThe city was further developed under Caliph al-Mutawakkil, who sponsored the construction of lavish palace complexes, such as al-Mutawakkiliyya, and the Great Mosque of Samarra with its famous spiral minaret or Malwiya, built-in 847. For his son al-Mu'tazz he built the large palace Bulkuwara.\n\nThe Nestorian patriarch Sargis (860–72) moved the patriarchal seat of the Church of the East from Baghdad to Samarra, and one or two of his immediate successors may also have sat in Samarra so as to be close to the seat of power.\nSamarra remained the residence of the caliph until 892, when al-Mu'tadid returned the capital to Baghdad. Historical sources report that the city was looted around this time. Its population probably decreased and the city declined, but it remained an important market center.\nFrom the tenth century onward it turned into an important pilgrimage site. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the river's course to the south of the city shifted further east. As a result, the main road between Baghdad and Mosul was moved to the west bank and Samarra lost its importance as a trading town.\n\nModern era\nIn the eighteenth century, one of the most violent battles of the 1730–1735 Ottoman–Persian War, the Battle of Samarra, took place, where over 50,000 Turks and Persians became casualties. The engagement decided the fate of Ottoman Iraq and kept it under Istanbul's suzerainty until the First World War.\nDuring the 1950s, Samarra gained new importance when a permanent lake, Lake Tharthar, was created through the construction of the Samarra Barrage, which was built in order to prevent the frequent flooding of Baghdad. Many local people were displaced by the dam, resulting in an increase in Samarra's population.\n\nSamarra is a key city in Saladin Governorate, a major part of the so-called Sunni Triangle where insurgents were active during the Iraq War. Though Samarra is famous for its Shi'i holy sites, including the tombs of several Shi'i Imams, the town was traditionally and until very recently, dominated by Sunni Arabs. Tensions arose between Sunnis and the Shi'a during the Iraq War. On February 22, 2006, the golden dome of the al-Askari Mosque was bombed by Al-Qaeda in Iraq, setting off a period of rioting and reprisal attacks across the country which claimed hundreds of lives. No organization claimed responsibility for the bombing. On June 13, 2007, Sunni insurgents attacked the mosque again and destroyed the two minarets that flanked the dome's ruins. On July 12, 2007, the clock tower was blown up. No fatalities were reported. Shiʿi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr called for peaceful demonstrations and three days of mourning. He stated that he believed no Sunni Arab could have been behind the attack, though according to the New York Times the attackers were probably Sunni militants linked to Al-Qaeda. The mosque compound was closed after the 2006 bombing and a indefinite curfew was placed on the city by the Iraqi police at the time. In 2009, the mosque reopened while restoration was ongoing.\nEver since the end of Iraqi civil war in 2007, the Shia population of the holy city has increased exponentially. However, violence has continued, with bombings taking place in 2011 and 2013. In June 2014, the city was attacked by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) as part of their Northern Iraq offensive.  ISIL forces captured the municipality building and university, but were later repulsed by the Iraqi army and SWAT forces after capturing the city and holding it for two days. The nearby Imam Dur Mausoleum, a historic mausoleum dedicated to Muslim ibn Quraysh, a Shi'i ruler, was destroyed by ISIL in 2014.\n\nGeography\nClimate\nSamarra has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh). Most rain falls in the winter. The average annual temperature in Samarra  is 22.7 °C (72.9 °F). About 171 mm (6.73 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nReligious significance\nThe city is also home to al-Askari Shrine, containing the mausolea of the Imams Ali al-Hadi and Hasan al-Askari, the tenth and eleventh Shiʿi Imams, respectively. This has made it an important pilgrimage centre for the Imami Shias. In addition, Hakimah and Narjis, female relatives of the Prophet Muhammad and the Imams, held in high esteem by Muslims, are buried there, making this mosque one of the most significant sites of worship.\n\nSports\nSamarra is home to the Samarra SC, that plays in the second highest division of the Iraqi football league system, namely Iraqi Premier Division League. Its ground is the Samarra Stadium.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe metaphor of \"Having an appointment in Samarra\", signifying death, is a literary reference to an ancient Babylonian myth recorded in the Babylonian Talmud and transcribed by W. Somerset Maugham, in which Death narrates a man's futile attempt to escape him by fleeing from Baghdad to Samarra.  The story \"The Appointment in Samarra\" subsequently formed the germ of a novel of the same name by John O'Hara. The original story was retold in verse by F. L. Lucas in his poem \"The Destined Hour\" in From Many Times and Lands (1953).\nIn the 1968 film Targets, Byron Orlok, an aging horror film star played by Boris Karloff, tells Maugham's version of the story to his younger colleagues.\nThe story is told in \"The Six Thatchers\", a 2017 episode of Sherlock.\n\nNotable people\nAhmed Abdul Ghafoor, former head of the Sunni Endowment Office with the rank of Minister.\nAhmed Hassan Al-Taha, the most senior scholar of the Sunni sect in Iraq, university professor, Imam and preacher at the Abu Hanifa Mosque and member of the Supreme Council of the Iraqi Jurisprudence Assembly of Senior Scholars for Preaching and Fatwa.\nSaleh al-Badri (1893-1943), poet\n\nSee also\nList of places in Iraq\n\nReferences\nSelected bibliography\nDe la Vaissière, Étienne (2007): Samarcande et Samarra.

The mosque was commissioned in 848 CE and completed in 851 by the Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil. At the time of construction, it was the world's largest mosque. It is known for its 52-metre-high (171 ft) minaret encircled by a spiral ramp. The former mosque is within the 15,058-hectare (37,210-acre) Samarra Archaeological City UNESCO World Heritage Site, listed in 2007.\n\nHistory\nFor a time, the mosque was the largest in the world; its minaret, the Malwiya Tower, is a spiralling cone 52 metres (171 ft) high and 33 metres (108 ft) wide with a spiral ramp. \n\nThe reign of Al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–861) had a great effect on the appearance of the city, for he seemed to have been a lover of architecture, and the one responsible for building the Great Mosque of Samarra. Al-Mutawakkil and his hired workers as well as other people from the area constructed this mosque using baked brick octagon piers that included four marble columns in the corners. The marble columns were imported, which draws on the fact that Al-Mutawakkil hired artists and architects from all over the Abbasid empire to help him construct the Great Mosque. In a list of his building projects which appears in several different versions, the new congregational mosque and up to twenty palaces are mentioned, totalling between 258 and 294 million dirhams. The new congregational mosque, with its spiral minaret, built between 234 AH (848/849 CE) and 236 AH (850/851CE), formed part of an extension of the city to the east, extending into the old hunting park.\nThe mosque had 17 aisles, and its walls were paneled with mosaics of dark blue glass. It was part of an extension of Samarra eastwards. The art and architecture of the mosque were influential; stucco carvings within the mosque in floral and geometric designs represent early Islamic decoration. The Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo, Egypt, was based on the Samarra Mosque in many regards and similarly stands in a large open space.\nAt the time of construction, another major feature of Samarra was the inlets of the great Nahrawan canal. This provided flood plains for a rich agricultural centre. Small and medium-sized game were also hunted in the area. This encompassed the main area of the city that held Islamic structures like the main palace and subsidiary palaces of the Waziri and the Umari as well as a large number of houses in a residential area. The Great Mosque was built right outside this main area and became a staple for the people of Samarra as well as visitors and foreigners. This project, along with others by Al-Mutawakkil, transformed the city of Samarra from a medium-sized centre into the enormous city seen today.\nThe mind behind the mosque, Al-Mutawakkil, was assassinated in 861, and structures like this mosque were then difficult to credit to a subsequent caliph. There was unrest and a ten-year period of trouble, including a civil war in 865–866. This Great Mosque was one of the last buildings with a known name attributed to it in this period.\nThe mosque was destroyed in 656 AH (1258/1259CE), after Hulagu Khan's invasion of Iraq.\n\nModern conservation\nOnly the mosque's outer wall and its minaret have been preserved. The Iraqi State Organization of Antiquities have been working closely with historians and architects in a restoration process starting in 1956. They tasked people to restore various monuments in Samarra including the Great Mosque. There was extensive restoration done to both the courtyard of the mosque as well as the spiral minaret. Previously, only 6 steps remained in the minaret and very few complete arches surrounded the courtyard.\nThe minaret sustained further damage in 2005, when its top was destroyed by an explosion. According to some sources, Iraqi insurgents were responsible for the attack, following the tower's use as a sniper position by US forces. In 2015, UNESCO and the Iraqi government announced a project to restore the minaret and assess damages to the rest of the Samarra archeological site, which was made a World Heritage Site in 2007.\n\nArchitecture\nLayout\nThe mosque's main structure is encompassed by a baked brick wall on the outer edge including forty-four semi-circular towers supporting the structure. The outer wall includes twenty-eight windows. Twenty-four of them are facing the southeastern side, the qiblah. There is one window for each aisle, excluding the mihrab site. The building has a total of sixteen doors that provide access. The interior of the mosque presents a large courtyard surrounded by covered aisles on all sides. The prayer hall featured a large mihrab framed as an arch. There was a fountain in the center of the courtyard that was covered and decorated in marble tile and mosaics. This fountain was believed to be carved from one large stone (called a kasat al-fir'awn or, the Pharaoh's Cup) and carried to this area by elephants. It was constructed by caliph al-Wathiq. The traditional mosque courtyard was square, however, the Great Mosque of Samarra portrayed a rectangular courtyard surrounded by these two layers of walls. It is known by historians and architects for the walls of the mosque to be covered in glazed or glass panels. These would be in the traditional blues, whites, and golds used in many other mosques. Fragments of these panels have been found by archaeologists working on the mosques. The interior of the mosque has ceilings with a height of 11 meters with a total of 464 pillars supporting this baked brick ceiling. For the most part the interior is plain and the focus was a strong foundation set by a continuous brick slab holding together these pillars.\n\nMinaret\nThe Malwiya Tower (Arabic: ٱلْمِنَارَة ٱلْمَلْوِيَّة, romanized: Al-Minārat al-Malwiyyah, lit. 'The Twisted Minaret', or 'The Snail Shell Minaret') was originally connected to the mosque by a bridge. The minaret or tower was constructed in 848–852 of sandstone, and is unique among other minarets because of its ascending spiral conical design. 52 metres (171 ft) high and 33 metres (108 ft) wide at the base, the spiral contains stairs reaching to the top.\nThe height of the Malwiyyah made it practical to be used for the adhan (call to prayer). It is visible from a considerable distance in the area around Samarra and therefore may have been designed as a strong visual statement of the presence of Islam in the Tigris Valley.\nThe minaret's unique spiral design is said by some to be derived from the architecture of the Mesopotamian ziggurats. This design, completed under al-Mutawakkil, was unlike other minarets created in this time or anything else seen in the Islamic world because of its base's shape. The Mesopotamian Ziggurats had a square base while this minaret and others built like it in Iraq have a circular base with a twisted spiral leading up to the top. Some consider the influence of the Pillar of Gor, which was also square not circular, built in the Sasanian Empire, more prominent. This style of spiraling minaret was then repeated by the caliph Abu Dulaf for his mosque (also in Samarra). These minarets become a focal point of the skyline in any city and are a call to attention and prayer. These earlier theories which proposed that these helicoidal minarets were inspired by ancient Mesopotamian ziggurats has been challenged and rejected by some modern scholars including Richard Ettinghausen, Oleg Grabar, and Jonathan Bloom.\nThe minaret's spiral shape inspired Pritzker Architecture Prize winner Philip Johnson's design for the 1976 Chapel of Thanksgiving at Thanks-Giving Square in Dallas, Texas, in the United States. The minarets of a prominent Emirati mosque, that of Sheikh Khalifa in Al Ain, have been also been inspired by this minaret. The influence of the minaret and courtyard of the mosque is seen in these places, as well as in modern mosques.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nIslam in Iraq\nList of mosques in Iraq\nChogha Zanbil\nFiruzabad, Fars\nList of tallest structures built before the 20th century\nThe Wonderful Barn\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nNecipoğlu, G., ed.

Ctesiphon served as a royal capital of the Iranian empires for over eight hundred years, in the Parthian and Sasanian periods. Ctesiphon was the administrative capital of the Sasanian Empire from 226–637 until the Muslim conquest of Persia in 651 AD.\nCtesiphon developed into a rich commercial metropolis, merging with the surrounding cities along both shores of the river, including the Hellenistic city of Seleucia. Ctesiphon and its environs were therefore sometimes referred to as \"The Cities\" (Mahuza, Arabic: المدائن, romanized: al-Mada'in). In the late 6th and early 7th century, it was listed as the largest city in the world by some accounts.\nDuring the Roman–Parthian Wars, Ctesiphon fell three times to the Romans, and later fell once during Sasanian rule. It was also the site of the Battle of Ctesiphon in 363 AD. After the Muslim invasion and conquest, the city fell into decline and was depopulated by the end of the 8th century, its place as a political and economic center being taken by Baghdad, the Abbasid capital. The most conspicuous structure remaining today is the Taq Kasra, sometimes called the Archway of Ctesiphon.\n\nNames\nThe Latin name Ctesiphon derives from Ancient Greek Ktēsiphôn (Κτησιφῶν). This is ostensibly a Greek toponym based on a personal name, although it may be a Hellenized form of a local name, reconstructed as Tisfōn or Tisbōn. In Iranian-language texts of the Sasanian era, it is spelled as Tyspwn, which can be read as Tīsfōn, Tēsifōn, etc. in Manichaean Parthian, in Middle Persian 𐭲𐭩𐭮𐭯𐭥𐭭 and in Christian Sogdian (in Syriac alphabet) languages. The New Persian form is Tisfun (تیسفون).\nTexts from the Church of the East's synods referred to the city as Qṭēspōn (Classical Syriac: ܩܛܝܣܦܘܢ) or some times Māḥôzē (Classical Syriac: ܡܚܘܙ̈ܐ) when referring to the metropolis of Seleucia-Ctesiphon.\nIn modern Arabic, the name is usually Ṭaysafūn (طيسفون) or Qaṭaysfūn (قطيسفون) or as al-Mada'in (المدائن \"The Cities\", referring to Greater Ctesiphon). \"According to Yāqūt [...], quoting Ḥamza, the original form was Ṭūsfūn or Tūsfūn, which was arabicized as Ṭaysafūn.\" The Armenian name of the city was Tizbon (Տիզբոն). Ctesiphon is first mentioned in the Book of Ezra of the Old Testament as Kasfia/Casphia (a derivative of the ethnic name Cas, and a cognate of Caspian and Qazvin). It is also mentioned in the Talmud as Aktisfon. In another Talmudic reference it is written as Akistfon, located across the Tigris River from the city of Ardashir.\n\nLocation\nCtesiphon is located approximately at Al-Mada'in, 35 km (22 mi) southeast of the modern city of Baghdad, Iraq, along the river Tigris. Ctesiphon measured 30 square kilometers, more than twice the surface of a 13.7-square-kilometer fourth-century imperial Rome.\nThe archway of Chosroes (Taq Kasra) was once a part of the royal palace in Ctesiphon and is estimated to date between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD. It is located in what is now the Iraqi town of Salman Pak.\n\nHistory\nParthian period\nCtesiphon was founded in the late 120s BC. It was built on the site of a military camp established across from Seleucia by Mithridates I of Parthia. The reign of Gotarzes I saw Ctesiphon reach a peak as a political and commercial center. The city became the Empire's capital circa 58 BC during the reign of Orodes II. Gradually, the city merged with the old Hellenistic capital of Seleucia and other nearby settlements to form a cosmopolitan metropolis.\nThe reason for this westward relocation of the capital could have been in part due to the proximity of the previous capitals (Mithradatkirt, and Hecatompylos at Hyrcania) to the Scythian incursions.\nStrabo abundantly describes the foundation of Ctesiphon:\n\nIn ancient times Babylon was the metropolis of Assyria; but now Seleucia is the metropolis, I mean the Seleucia on the Tigris, as it is called. Nearby is situated a village called Ctesiphon, a large village. This village the kings of the Parthians were wont to make their winter residence, thus sparing the Seleucians, in order that the Seleucians might not be oppressed by having the Scythian folk or soldiery quartered amongst them. Because of the Parthian power, therefore, Ctesiphon is a city rather than a village; its size is such that it lodges a great number of people, and it has been equipped with buildings by the Parthians themselves; and it has been provided by the Parthians with wares for sale and with the arts that are pleasing to the Parthians; for the Parthian kings are accustomed to spend the winter there because of the salubrity of the air, but they summer at Ecbatana and in Hyrcania because of the prevalence of their ancient renown.\nBecause of its importance, Ctesiphon was a major military objective for the leaders of the Roman Empire in their eastern wars. The city was captured by Rome four or five times in its history – three times in the 2nd century alone. The emperor Trajan captured Ctesiphon in 116, but his successor, Hadrian, decided to willingly return Ctesiphon in 117 as part of a peace settlement. The Roman general Avidius Cassius captured Ctesiphon in 164 during another Parthian war, but abandoned it when peace was concluded. In 197, the emperor Septimius Severus sacked Ctesiphon and carried off thousands of its inhabitants, whom he sold into slavery.\n\nSasanian period\nBy 226, Ctesiphon was in the hands of the Sasanian Empire, who also made it their capital and had laid an end to the Parthian dynasty of Iran. Ctesiphon was greatly enlarged and flourished during their rule, thus turning into a metropolis, which was known by in Arabic as al-Mada'in, and in Aramaic as Mahoze. The oldest inhabited places of Ctesiphon were on its eastern side, which in Islamic Arabic sources is called \"the Old City\" (مدينة العتيقة Madīnah al-'Atīqah), where the residence of the Sasanians, known as the White Palace (قصر الأبيض), was located. The southern side of Ctesiphon was known as Asbānbar or Aspānbar, which was known by its prominent halls, riches, games, stables, and baths. Taq Kasra was located in the latter.\nThe western side was known as Veh-Ardashir (meaning \"the good city of Ardashir\" in Middle Persian), known as Mahoza by the Jews, Kokhe by the Christians, and Behrasir by the Arabs. Veh-Ardashir was populated by many wealthy Jews, and was the seat of the church of the Nestorian patriarch. To the south of Veh-Ardashir was Valashabad. Ctesiphon had several other districts which were named Hanbu Shapur, Darzanidan, Veh Jondiu-Khosrow, Nawinabad and Kardakadh.\nSeverus Alexander advanced towards Ctesiphon in 233, but as corroborated by Herodian, his armies suffered a humiliating defeat against Ardashir I. In 283, emperor Carus sacked the city uncontested during a period of civil upheaval. Some historians have claimed that Galerius marched on Ctesiphon and was able to capture it. However, this is never explicitly stated in any source and is still a matter of debate among scholars.\nHence that he returned it to the Persian king Narses in exchange for Armenia and western Mesopotamia is also likely to have never happened. In c. 325 and again in 410, the city, or the Greek colony directly across the river, was the site of church councils for the Church of the East.\n\nAfter the conquest of Antioch in 541, Khosrow I built a new city near Ctesiphon for the inhabitants he captured. He called this new city Veh-Antiok-Xusrō, or literally, \"better than Antioch Khosrow built this\". Local inhabitants of the area called the new city Rumagan, meaning \"town of the Romans\" and Arabs called the city al-Rumiyya. Along with Weh Antiok, Khosrow built a number of fortified cities. After a campaign in 573, John of Ephesus wrote that no fewer than 292,000 persons had been deported from Dara, Apamia, and other Syrian towns to Veh-Antiokh. John would later cite a letter stating no more than 30,000 prisoners were deported. It's thought that the first number he gave is not to be taken literally.\nIn 590, a member of the House of Mihran, Bahram Chobin repelled the newly ascended Sasanian ruler Khosrow II from Iraq, and conquered the region. One year later, Khosrow II, with aid from the Byzantine Empire, reconquered his domains. During his reign, some of the great fame of al-Mada'in decreased, due to the popularity of Khosrow's new winter residence, Dastagerd. In 627, the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius surrounded the city, the capital of the Sassanid Empire, leaving it after the Persians accepted his peace terms. In 628, a deadly plague hit Ctesiphon, al-Mada'in and the rest of the western part of the Sasanian Empire, which even killed Khosrow's son and successor, Kavad II.\nIn 629, Ctesiphon was briefly under the control of Mihranid usurper Shahrbaraz, but the latter was shortly assassinated by the supporters of Khosrow II's daughter Borandukht. Ctesiphon then continued to be involved in constant fighting between two factions of the Sasanian Empire, the Pahlav (Parthian) faction under the House of Ispahbudhan and the Parsig (Persian) faction under Piruz Khosrow.\n\nDownfall of the Sasanians and the Islamic conquests\nIn the mid-630s, the Muslim Arabs, who had invaded the territories of the Sasanian Empire, defeated them during a great battle known as the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah. The Arabs then attacked Ctesiphon, and occupied it in early 637.\nThe Muslim military officer Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas quickly seized Valashabad and made a peace treaty with the inhabitants of Veh-Antiok-Xusrō and Veh-Ardashir. The terms of the treaty were that the inhabitants of Veh-Antiok-Xusrō were allowed to leave if they wanted to, but if they did not, they were forced to acknowledge Muslim authority, and also pay tribute (jizya). Later on, when the Muslims arrived at Ctesiphon, it was completely desolated, due to flight of the Sasanian royal family, nobles, and troops. However, the Muslims had managed to take some of troops captive, and many riches were seized from the Sasanian treasury and were given to the Muslim troops. Furthermore, the throne hall in Taq Kasra was briefly used as a mosque.\nStill, as political and economic fortune had passed elsewhere, the city went into a rapid decline, especially after the founding of the Abbasid capital at Baghdad in the 760s, and soon became a ghost town. Caliph Al-Mansur took much of the required material for the construction of Baghdad from the ruins of Ctesiphon. He also attempted to demolish the palace and reuse its bricks for his own palace, but he desisted only when the undertaking proved too vast. Al-Mansur also used the al-Rumiya town as the Abbasid capital city for a few months.\nIt is believed to be the basis for the city of Isbanir in One Thousand and One Nights.\n\nModern era\nThe ruins of Ctesiphon were the site of a major battle of World War I in November 1915. The Ottoman Empire defeated troops of Britain attempting to capture Baghdad, and drove them back some 40 miles (64 km) before trapping the British force and compelling it to surrender.\n\nPopulation and religion\nUnder Sasanian rule, the population of Ctesiphon was heavily mixed: it included Arameans, Persians, Greeks and Assyrians. Several religions were also practiced in the metropolis, which included Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. In 497, the first Nestorian patriarch Mar Babai I, fixed his see at Seleucia-Ctesiphon, supervising their mission east, with the Merv metropolis as pivot. The population also included Manicheans, a dualist church, who continued to be mentioned in Ctesiphon during Umayyad rule fixing their \"patriarchate of Babylon\" there. Much of the population fled from Ctesiphon after the Arab capture of the metropolis. However, a portion of Persians remained there, and some important figures of these people are known to have provided Ali with presents, which he, however, refused to take. In the ninth century, the surviving Manicheans fled and displaced their patriarchate up the Silk Road, in Samarkand.\n\nArchaeology\nA German Oriental Society expedition led by Oscar Reuther excavated at Ctesiphon in 1928–29 mainly at Qasr bint al-Qadi on the western part of the site. In winter of 1931–1932 a joint expedition of the German State Museums (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin) and The Metropolitan Museum of Art continued excavations at the site, focusing on the areas of Ma'aridh, Tell Dheheb, the Taq-i Kisra, Selman Pak and Umm ez-Za'tir under the direction of Ernst Kühnel.\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, an Italian team from the University of Turin directed by Antonio Invernizzi and Giorgio Gullini worked at the part of the site on the other side of the Tigris, which they identified as Veh Ardashir. Work mainly concentrated on restoration at the palace of Khosrow II. In 2013, the Iraqi government contracted to restore the Taq Kasra, as a tourist attraction.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of cities of the ancient Near East\nOpis\nAchaemenid Empire\nRachae\nSasanian Empire\nSchool of Seleucia-Ctesiphon\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nM.

          "summary": "Ctesiphon ( TESS-if-on; Middle Persian: 𐭲𐭩𐭮𐭯𐭥𐭭, Tyspwn or Tysfwn; Persian: تیسفون; Ancient Greek: Κτησιφῶν, Attic Greek: [ktɛːsipʰɔ̂ːn]; Syriac: ܩܛܝܣܦܘܢ) was an ancient city in modern Iraq, on the eastern bank of the Tigris, about 35 kilometres (22 mi) southeast of Baghdad. Ctesiphon served as a royal capital of the Iranian empires for over eight hundred years, in the Parthian and Sasanian periods. Ctesiphon was the administrative capital of the Sasanian Empire from 226–637 until the Muslim conquest of Persia in 651 AD.\nCtesiphon developed into a rich commercial metropolis, merging with the surrounding cities along both shores of the river, including the Hellenistic city of Seleucia. Ctesiphon and its environs were therefore sometimes referred to as \"The Cities\" (Mahuza, Arabic: المدائن, romanized: al-Mada'in). In the late 6th and early 7th century, it was listed as the largest city in the world by some accounts.\nDuring the Roman–Parthian Wars, Ctesiphon fell three times to the Romans, and later fell once during Sasanian rule. It was also the site of the Battle of Ctesiphon in 363 AD. After the Muslim invasion and conquest, the city fell into decline and was depopulated by the end of the 8th century, its place as a political and economic center being taken by Baghdad, the Abbasid capital. The most conspicuous structure remaining today is the Taq Kasra, sometimes called the Archway of Ctesiphon.",

الميلاد وورثها الفرس، والتي بَقَت مركزًا رئيسيًا للبلاد حتى حلت محلها بغداد في القرن الثامن. وكانت عاصمه الساسانيين والفرثيين. بنيت المدينه على الضفه الشرقيه لنهر دجله قرب بلده المدائن/سلمان باك الحاليه ما يقارب ال35 كم جنوب شرق بغداد. يقع موقع طيسفون قرب موقع مدينه سلوقيه الاثريه التي بناها السلوقيون. من اشهر معالم طيسفون بناء طاق كسرى او ايوان كسرى الذي كان مقر الحكم الساساني.\n\nالموقع\nتقع مدينه طسيفون في منطقه المدائن تقريبًا، على بُعد 35 كيلومترًا (22 ميلًا) جنوب شرق مدينه بغداد الحديثه في العراق، على ضفاف نهر دجله. بلغت مساحتها 30 كيلومترًا مربعًا، اي اكثر من ضعف مساحه روما الامبراطوريه في القرن الرابع الميلادي التي بلغت مساحتها 13.7 كيلومترًا مربعًا.\nكان ايوان كسرى (طاق كسرى) جزءًا من القصر الملكي في طسيفون ويُقدّر تاريخه بين القرنين الثالث والسادس الميلاديين. ويقع فيما يُعرف اليوم بمدينه سلمان باك العراقيه.\n\nتاريخ\nالفتره البارثيه\nتاسست طسيفون في اواخر القرن الثاني عشر قبل الميلاد. وبُنيت على موقع مخيّمٍ عسكري اقامه مهرداد الاول ملك بارثيا قباله سلوقيه. وبلغت ذروه مجدها كمركز سياسي وتجاري في عهد غوتارزيس الاول. غدت المدينه عاصمه الامبراطوريه نحو عام 58 قبل الميلاد في عهد اورود الثاني. واندمجت تدريجيًا مع العاصمه الهلنستيه القديمه سلوقيه، وغيرها من المستوطنات المجاوره لتشكل مدينه عالميه متعدده الثقافات.\nيرجع السبب جزئيًا في نقل العاصمه غربًا، الى قرب العواصم السابقه (نسا، وقومس في هيركانيا) من غزوات السكوثيين ربما.\n\nيصف اسطرابون تاسيس طسيفون على نحوٍ مفصل:«كانت بابل عاصمه اشور في العصور القديمه؛ اما الان فهي سلوقيه، واعني سلوقيه على نهر دجله، كما تُسمى. وتقع بالقرب منها قريه تُدعى طسيفون، وهي قريهٌ كبيره. اعتاد الملوك البارثيون جعل هذه القريه مقر اقامتهم الشتوي، ليستبقوا على السلوقيين حتى لا يُضطهدوا نتيجه ايوائهم الشعب او الجنود السكوثيين بينهم. وبسبب قوه البارثيين، باتت طسيفون مدينه اكثر منها قريه؛ فحجمها كبير لدرجه انها تؤوي عددًا كبيرًا من السكان، وقد جهزها البارثيون انفسهم بالمباني؛ وزودوها بالبضائع للتجاره، وبالفنون التي تُرضي البارثيين. اذ اعتاد الملوك منهم قضاء الشتاء هناك بسبب الهواء الصحي، لكنهم كانوا يقضون الصيف في اكباتانا وهيركانيا بسبب سيادتهم القديمه في تلك المناطق».كانت طسيفون هدفًا عسكريًا رئيسًا لقاده الامبراطوريه الرومانيه في حروبهم الشرقيه نظرًا لاهميتها. واستولت روما على المدينه اربع او خمس مرات في تاريخها، ثلاث منها في القرن الثاني. واستولى الامبراطور تراجان عليها في عام 116، لكن خليفته هادريان قرر اعادتها طواعيهً في عام 117 كجزء من تسويه سلميّه. واستولى الجنرال الروماني افيديوس كاسيوس على طسيفون في عام 164 خلال حرب بارثيه اخرى هي الحرب الرومانيه الفرثيه (161-166)، لكنه تخلى عنها عند ابرام السلام. وفي عام 197، نهب الامبراطور سيبتيموس سيفيروس طسيفون واسر الافًا من سكانها وباعهم كعبيد.\n\nالفتره الساسانيه\nكانت طسيفون مع حلول عام 226، في قبضه الامبراطوريه الساسانيه التي اتخذتها ايضًا عاصمه لها، وانهت حكم سلاله البارثيين في ايران. توسعت المدينه وازدهرت على نحو كبير خلال حكمهم، وتحولت الى عاصمه عُرفت بالعربيه باسم «المدائن»، وبالاراميه باسم «ماهوزا». كانت اقدم الاماكن الماهوله في طسيفون تقع على جانبها الشرقي الذي يُطلق عليه في المصادر العربيه الاسلاميه «المدينه العتيقه»، حيث كان مقر اقامه الساسانيين المعروف بالقصر الابيض. اما الجانب الجنوبي من المدينه، فعُرف باسم اسبانبار الذي اشتهر بقاعاته الفخمه وثرواته والعابه واسطبلاته وحماماته. وكان يقع في هذا الاخير قصر طاق كسرى.\nعُرف الجانب الغربي باسم «فيه-اردشير» (ويعني «مدينه اردشير الطيبه» باللغه البهلوليه)، وعرفها اليهود باسم «ماهوزا»، والمسيحيون باسم «كوخه»، والعرب باسم «بهراسير». كانت «فيه-اردشير» ماهوله بعديدٍ من اليهود الاثرياء، وكانت مقر كنيسه البطريرك النسطوري. والى الجنوب من «فيه-اردشير» كانت تقع «فالشاباد». وكانت طسيفون تضم عده مقاطعات اخرى سُميت «هانبو شابور»، و«درزانيدان»، و«وه جونديو خسرو»، و«ناوين اباد»، و«كارداقاد».\nتقدمّ سيفيروس الكسندر نحو طسيفون في عام 233، ولكن كما اكد هيروديان، مُنيت جيوشه بهزيمه مُذله امام اردشير الاول. وفي عام 283، نهب الامبراطور ماركوس اوريليوس كاروس المدينه من دون مُنازع خلال فتره من الاضطرابات المدنيه. زعم بعض المؤرخين ان غاليريوس زحف نحو طسيفون وتمكن من الاستيلاء عليها. لكن ذلك لم يُذكر صراحهً ولا في اي مصدر، ولا يزال موضع جدل بين الباحثين.\nلذا، فمن المرجح ايضًا ان اعادتها للملك الفارسي نرسي بن هرمز مقابل ارمينيا وغرب بلاد ما بين النهرين، لم يحدث قط. كانت المدينه او المستعمره اليونانيه الواقعه مباشره عبر النهر، موقعًا لمجالس كنسيه تابعه لكنيسه المشرق، وذلك نحو عام 325، ومره اخرى نحو عام 410.\nبعد فتح انطاكيه في عام 541، بنى كسرى الاول مدينه جديده قرب طسيفون لسكانها الذين اسرهم. اطلق على هذه المدينه الجديده اسم «فيه-انطاكيه-كسرو»، او حرفيًا «افضل من انطاكيه ومن بناء خسرو». اطلق سكان المنطقه المحليون على المدينه الجديده اسم روماغان، اي «مدينه الرومان»، بينما اطلق عليها العرب اسم الروميه. الى جانب «فيه-انطاكيه»، بنى كسرى عددًا من المدن المحصنه. وكتب يوحنا الافسسي بعد حمله عام 573 ان ما لا يقل عن 292 الف شخص قد رُحِّلوا من دارا وافاميا ومدن سريانيه اخرى الى «فيه-انطاكيه». واستشهد يوحنا لاحقًا برساله تفيد بان عدد الاسرى الذين رُحِّلوا لم يتجاوز 30 الفًا. ويُعتقد ان الرقم الاول الذي ذكره لا يُؤخذ بحرفيته.\nدحر بهرام جوبين، احد افراد اسره مهران، في عام 590، الحاكم الساساني الصاعد حديثًا، كسرى الثاني من العراق، واستولى على المنطقه. وبعد عام واحد، استعاد كسرى الثاني ممتلكاته، بمساعده الامبراطوريه البيزنطيه. تراجعت شهره المدائن على نحوٍ كبير خلال فتره حكمه، بسبب شعبيه مقر اقامه كسرى الشتوي الجديد، داستاغرد. وفي عام 627، حاصر الامبراطور البيزنطي هرقل المدينه، عاصمه الامبراطوريه الساسانيه، وتركها بعد ان قَبِل الفرس شروط السلام الخاصه به. وفي عام 628، اصاب وباء مميت طسيفون والمدائن وبقيه الجزء الغربي من الامبراطوريه الساسانيه، ما اودى بحياه ابن كسرى وخليفته، قباد الثاني.\nظلت طسيفون لفتره وجيزه تحت سيطره المغتصب المهراني شهربراز في عام 629، وبعد ان اغتيل الاخير على يد انصار بوران دخت، ابنه كسرى الثاني، واصلت طسيفون انخراطها في القتال المستمر بين فصيلين من الامبراطوريه الساسانيه هما، فصيل بهلاف (الفرثي) تحت حكم اسره اسباهبودان والفصيل البارسيج (الفارسي) تحت قياده بيروز خسرو.\n\nبعد الفتح الاسلامي\nعندما سقطت العاصمه الفارسيه طيسفون الواقعه في مقاطعه خفرفان (المعروفه اليوم بالعراق) على يد المُسلمين خلال الفتح الاسلامي للعراق في عام 637 تحت القياده العسكريه لسعد بن ابي وقاص خلال خلافه عمر بن الخطاب تم حرق قصورها ومحفوظاتها. وفقًا لمحمد بن جرير الطبري في كتابه تاريخ الطبري، كتب القائد العربي سعد بن ابي وقاص الى الخليفه عمر بن الخطّاب يسال فيه عما ينبغي فعله بالكتب في رسالته. وكان رد عمر: اذا كانت الكتب تتناقض مع القران، فهي تجديف. من ناحيه اخرى، اذا كانت متفقه معها، فليس هناك حاجه لها، لان القران كافٍ لنا. وتم تدمير مكتبه ضخمه وتم حرق عشرات الكتب، وهي نتاج لاجيال من العلماء والباحثين الفرس، وتم اسر ما يقرب من 40,000 من النبلاء الفرس وتم بيعهم لاحقًا كعبيد في الجزيره العربيه. اقام العرب المسلمون مدينه المدائن على انقاض مدينتي طيسفون وسلوقيه، حيث دفن الصحابي سلمان الفارسي في المدائن. وقد استخدم ابو جعفر المنصور بعضًا من حجاره طيسفون والمدائن في بناء بغداد.\n\nاعلام\nكسرى الاول\nكسرى الثاني\nماني\nابن ابي الحديد\nهرمز الرابع\n\nمعرض صور\nانظر ايضًا\nايوان

Some historians believe it was constructed under Shapur I who ruled Sassanian Persia from 242 to 272 AD and some other believe that construction possibly began during the reign of Anushiruwan the Just (Khosrow I) after a campaign against the Byzantines in 540 AD. The arched iwan hall, open on the facade side, was about 37 meters high, 26 meters across and 50 meters long, the largest man-made, free standing vault constructed until modern times.\nThe arch was part of the imperial palace complex. The throne room—presumably under or behind the arch—was more than 30 m (110 ft) high and covered an area 24 m (80 ft) wide by 48 m (160 ft) long. The top of the arch is about 1 meter thick while the walls at the base are up to 7 meters thick. The catenary arch was built without centring. In order to make this possible a number of techniques were used. The bricks were laid about 18 degrees from the vertical which allowed them to be partially supported by the rear wall during construction. The quick drying cement used as mortar allowed the fresh bricks to be quickly supported by those that were previously laid.\nThe Taq Kasra is now all that remains above ground of a city that was, for nine centuries—from the 2nd century BC to the 7th century AD—the main capital of the successor dynasties of the Persian empire: Parthians and Sassanids. The structure left today was the main portico of the audience hall of the Sassanids who maintained the same site chosen by the Parthians and for the same reason, namely proximity to the Roman Empire, whose expansionist aims could be better contained at the point of contact.\nThe structure was captured by the Arabs during the conquest of Persia in 637. They then used it as a mosque for a while until the area was gradually abandoned. In the early 10th century, the Abbasid caliph al-Muktafi dug up the ruins of the palace to reuse its bricks in the construction of the Taj Palace in Baghdad.\nThe Arabic poet Al-Buhturi wrote a famous poem about the ruins in the 9th century.\nThe monument is also the subject of a poem by the Persian poet Khaqani, who visited the ruins in the 12th century.\n\nModern era\nIn 1851, French artist Eugène Flandin visited and studied the structure with Pascal Coste who remarked \"the Romans had nothing similar or of the type.\"\nIn 1888, a serious flood demolished the greater part of the edifice.\nIn 1940, the British writer Roald Dahl, then undergoing pilot training at RAF Habbaniya near Baghdad took an award-winning photograph using a Zeiss camera of the Arch of Ctesiphon in Iraq which was subsequently auctioned by the Dahl family to raise funds for the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre. The photo made £6,000. In his autobiography Boy he writes:\n\nYou may not believe it, but when I was eighteen I used to win prizes and medals from the Royal Photographic Society in London, and from other places like the Photographic Society of Holland. I even got a lovely big bronze medal from the Egyptian Photographic Society in Cairo, and I still have the photograph that won it. It is a picture of one of the so-called Seven Wonders of the World, the Arch of Ctesiphon in Iraq. This is the largest unsupported arch on earth and I took the photograph while I was training out there for the RAF in 1940. I was flying over the desert solo in an old Hawker Hart biplane and I had my camera round my neck. When I spotted the huge arch standing alone in a sea of sand, I dropped one wing and hung in my straps and let go of the stick while I took aim and clicked the shutter. It came out fine.\nThe monument was in the process of being rebuilt by Saddam Hussein's government in the course of the 1980s, when the fallen northern wing was partially rebuilt. All works, however, stopped after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. From 2004 to 2008 the Iraqi government cooperated with the University of Chicago's Diyala Project to restore the site at a cost of $100,000. The Ministry of Culture also invited a Czech company, Avers, to restore the site. This restoration was completed in 2017.\nOn March 7, 2019, a partial collapse further damaged the Taq Kasra, just two years after its latest restoration was completed.\nIn January 2021, Iranian Minister of Cultural Heritage Ali Asghar Mounesan mentioned that a credit of about $600,000 would be required for the restoration of Taq Kasra.\n\nDocumentary film\nIn 2017, Pejman Akbarzadeh, based in the Netherlands, made the first full-length documentary film about Taq Kasra: Taq Kasra: Wonder of Architecture. The monument had been in danger of ISIS attacks in 2015–2016; Akbarzadeh feared that it might be destroyed soon, and therefore felt urgency to film his documentary. The film explores the history and architecture of Taq Kasra with many scholars and archaeologists in various countries.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nPersian Empire\nSasanians\nAl-Ukhaidir Fortress\nHatra\nPersian architecture\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nTaq Kasra Online Information Center\nArchent: Taq-i Kisra\nGlobal Heritage Fund page on Ctesiphon\nSwiss journalist's photos of Taq-e Kasra in 1970s: \"Taq-e Kasra; a Persian archaeological sight outside Persia (Photo)",

          "content": "Najaf is the capital city of the eponymous Najaf Governorate in central Iraq, about 160 km (99 mi) south of Baghdad. Its estimated population in 2024 was about 1.41 million people. It is widely considered amongst the holiest cities of Shia Islam and one of its spiritual capitals, as well as the center of Shia political power in Iraq.\nIt is the burial place of Muhammad's son in law and cousin, ‘Alī ibn Abī Tālib, and thus a major pilgrimage destination for Shia Muslims. The largest cemetery in the world (Wadi-us-Salaam) and the oldest Shi'a Islamic seminary in the world (Hawza of Najaf) are located in Najaf.\n\nEtymology\nAccording to Ibn Manzur, the word, \"najaf\" (نجف), literally means a high and rectangular place around which water is accumulated, although the water does not go above its level. Al-Shaykh al-Saduq appeals to a hadith from Ja'far al-Sadiq, claiming that \"Najaf\" comes from the phrase, \"nay jaff\" which means \"the nay sea has dried\".\n\"Najaf\" is usually accompanied by the adjective \"al-Ashraf\" (the dignified). According to the author of al-Hawza al-'ilmiyya fi l-Najaf al-ashraf, this is because 'Ali, one of the most dignified persons, is buried in the city.\nAl-Ghari or al-Ghariyyan, Hadd al-'Adhra', al-Hiwar, al-Judi, Wadi l-Salam, al-Zahr, Zahr al-Kufa (behind Kufa), al-Rabwa, Baniqiya, and Mashhad are other names for this land.\n\nHistory\nThe area of An-Najaf is located 30 km (19 mi) south of the ancient city of Babylon, and 400 km (248 mi) north of the ancient city of Ur. The city itself was founded in 791 AD, by the Abbasid Caliph Harūn ar-Rashīd, as a shrine to ‘Alī bin Abī Ṭālib.\n\nPrehistoric and ancient times\nArchaeological discoveries show the existence of a populace dating back to the 1st century BC. Najaf possesses one of the largest burial grounds in the vicinity for Christians. Discoveries in the following centuries point toward the city's multicultural and diverse religious history. Mohammed al-Mayali, director of Inspectorate Effects of the province of Najaf, states \"the excavation on the graves, which we have been working on for years, confirm that \"Najaf\" contains the largest Christian cemetery in Iraq, with a cemetery area of 1416 acres. We have found indications of Christianity on the graves through representations of crosses and stones with Christ-like engravings. There are also relics that date back to the Sassanid period. Also discovered in the excavation was proof of a thriving glass industry. Pots were decorated with the cross. as well as Hebrew writings, indicating a community of religious coexistence.\"\nWadi-us-Salaam in Najaf was once a holy cemetery for Jews and was then called Baniqia, which could be the first recorded name for the area.\n\nThe name Baniqia also was found in some texts which state that Abraham once visited and stayed in this village before continuing his journey from Mesopotamia to Arabia.\nIn Islam, the city is considered to have started with Ali who instructed that his burial place should remain a secret, as he had many enemies and he feared that his body might be subjected to some indignity. According to legend, the body of Ali was placed on a camel which was driven from Kufah. The camel stopped a few miles west of the city where the body was secretly buried. No tomb was raised and nobody knew of the burial place except for a few trusted people. It is narrated that more than a hundred years later the Abbasid Caliph, Harun al-Rashid, went deer hunting outside Kufah, and the deer sought sanctuary at a place where the hounds would not pursue it. On inquiry as to why the place was a sanctuary, he was told that it was the burial place of ‘Ali. Harūn ar-Rashīd ordered a mausoleum to be built on the spot and in due course the town of Najaf grew around the mausoleum.\n\nMedieval and modern history\nIn early 14th century, Sheikh Ibn Battuta visited the burial site of Ali ibn Abi Talib during his travels in Iraq after his pilgrimage to Mecca. During this period, Najaf was called Meshhed Ali. As Translated by Samuel Lee, Ibn Battuta in his Arabic Rihla relates:\n\nWe next proceeded to the city of Meshhed Ali where the grave of Ali ibn Abu Talib is thought to be. It is a handsome place and well peopled. There is no governor here, except a sort of tribune. The inhabitants consist chiefly of rich and brave merchants. About the gardens are plastered walls adorned with paintings, and within them are carpets, couches and lamps of gold and silver. Within the city is a large treasury kept by the tribune, which arises from the votive offerings arrived from different parts: for when anyone happens to be ill, or suffer under any infirmity, he will make a vow, and thence receive relief. The garden is also famous for its miracles; and hence it is believed that the grave of Ali is there. \nOf these miracles, the \"night of revival\" is one: for, on the 17th day of the month Rejeb, cripples come from different parts of Fars, Room, Khorasaan, Irak, and other places, assemble in companies from twenty to thirty in number. They are placed over the grave soon after sun-set. People then, some praying, some reciting the Quran, and others prostrating themselves, wait expecting their recovery and rising, when about the night, they all get up sound and right. This is a matter well known among them: I heard it from a creditable person, but was not present at one of those nights. I saw, however, several such afflicted persons, who had not yet received, but were looking forward for the advantages of this \"night of revival\".\nIn the 16th century, Najaf was conquered by the Ottomans, and became part of Ottoman Iraq. The Safavid dynasty of Iran maintained continuous interest to this Shia site. During the Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–1639), they were twice able to capture the city, but lost it again to the Ottomans in 1638.\nUnder the rule of the Ottoman Empire, Najaf experienced severe difficulties as the result of repeated raids by Arab desert tribes and the Persian army with acute water shortages causing lack of a reliable water supply. The number of inhabited houses in the city had plummeted from 3,000 to just 30 by the start of the 16th century.\nWhen the Portuguese traveller Pedro Texeira passed through Najaf in 1604, he found the city in ruins, inhabited by little more than 500 people. This was largely the result of a change in the course of the Euphrates river eastwards in the direction of Hilla, leaving Najaf and Kufa high and dry, leading to the destruction of the local formerly rich agriculture, demise of the palm groves and orchards, followed by the salinization of the underground water due to evaporation.\nDuring the 18th century, the scholarly life of Najaf came to be dominated by Farsi-speaking ‘Ulema’ (Arabic: عُلُمَاء, Scholars) from Iran.\nThe water shortages were finally resolved in 1803 when the Euphrates made its way to the city once again. The shift in the river's flow was the product of a century-long effort by the Ottomans to shift the flow of the river, so as to deprive marsh-dwelling tribes like the Khaza'il of the watery environment that allowed them to evade state control. These long-term efforts rendered successful the construction of the Hindiyya Canal in 1793, which further shifted the flow of the Euphrates. These hydrological shifts were to have religious implications. Most notable was the consolidation and spread of Shi'ism. As the shrine city of Najaf gained access to water again, its notables and holy men began to wield considerable power in the area. In 1811, the last city wall was rebuilt.\n\nModern period\nThe Ottomans were expelled in an uprising in 1915, following which the city fell under the rule of the British Empire. The sheikhs of Najaf including Sayyed Mahdi Al-Awadi rebelled in 1918, killing the British governor of the city, and cutting off grain supplies to the Anazzah, a tribe allied with the British. In retaliation the British besieged the city and cut off its water supply. The rebellion was put down and the rule of the sheikhs was forcibly ended. A great number of the Shi‘i ‘Ulema’ were expelled into Persia, where they set the foundations for the rise of the city of Qom as the center of the Shi‘ite learning and authority, in lieu of Najaf. Najaf lost its religious primacy to Qom, and was not to regain it until the 21st century, during the establishment of a Shī‘ī-majority government in Iraq after 2003.\nIn the 20th century, much of the Old City was rebuilt in a series of modernization initiatives. Beginning in the 1950s, many historic buildings and monuments, including those adjoining the shrine, were demolished for the construction of Sadeq, Zainulabidin, Rasool and Tousi streets. In 1958, the city wall was torn down and replaced with a ring road. In the 1980s, the entire area between the shrine and the city's western edge was demolished, and the residents resettled outside the city, in what locals perceived as a government reprisal for the Shia uprising under the leadership of Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, who was based in the neighborhood.\nDuring the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, Najaf was a key target of the invading United States Armed Forces. The city was encircled during heavy fighting on 26 March 2003 and was captured on 3 April 2003 (Battle of Najaf). The clerical authorities of the Shī‘ī enclave of Sadr City in Baghdad, which claimed autonomy in April 2003, after the fall of Baghdad, claimed to be taking their orders from senior clerics in Najaf.\nOn 4 April 2004, the Mahdi Army attacked the Spanish-Salvadoran-ALARNG base (Camp Golf, later renamed Camp Baker) in An Najaf, part of a coordinated uprising across central and southern Iraq in an apparent attempt to seize control of the country ahead of the 30 June 2004 handover of power to a new Iraqi government. This uprising led to the American troops arriving in the city in the wake of the Spanish withdrawal. In August 2004, heavy fighting broke out again between U.S. forces and Al-Sadr's Mahdi Army. The battle lasted three weeks and ended when senior Iraqi cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani negotiated an end to the fighting.\nIn 2012, Najaf was named the Cultural Centre of the Arab World. On 6 March 2021, Pope Francis visited the city during his historic papal visit to Iraq and held an interfaith dialogue with al-Sistani, where he expressed a message of peaceful coexistence between Muslims and Christians in the country. During the ISIS war, Najaf Shiites launched solidarity initiative with Sunni areas affected by ISIS. Many Iraqis including religious minorities such as Christians from the north, as well as Lebanese Shia have found safe haven in the city.\n\nGeography\nClimate\nNajaf has a hot desert climate, BWh in the Köppen climate classification, with long, very hot summers and mild winters. The average annual temperature is 23.6 °C (74.5 °F). The rainfall averages 69 mm (2.71 in).\n\nReligious significance\nAn-Najaf is considered sacred by Shi'a Muslims. An-Najaf is renowned as the site of the burial place of Muhammad's son-in-law and cousin, ‘Alī ibn Abī Tālib. The city is now a center of pilgrimage throughout the Shi'ite Islamic world. It is estimated that only Mecca and Medina receive more Muslim pilgrims. As the burial site of one of Shi'a Islam's most important figure, the Imam Ali Mosque is considered by Shiites as the third holiest Islamic site.\nThe Imam ‘Ali Mosque is housed in a grand structure with a gold gilded dome and many precious objects in the walls. Nearby is the Wadi-us-Salaam cemetery, the largest in the world. It contains the tombs of several prophets and many of the devout from around the world aspire to be buried there, to be raised from the dead with Imām ‘Alī on Judgement Day. Over the centuries, numerous hospices, schools, libraries and convents were built around the shrine to make the city the center of Shīʻa learning and theology.\nThe An-Najaf seminary, or Hawza Najaf, is one of the most important teaching centres in the Islamic world. Ayatollah Khomeini lectured there from 1965 to 1978. Many of the leading figures of the new Islamic movement that emerged in Iraq, Iran and Lebanon in the 1970s had studied at Najaf. As of 2014, it was estimated to have about 13,000 students.\n\nEconomy\nThe fall of the Ba'athist regime ended restrictions on Shi'ite pilgrimage, which led to a pilgrimage boom in Najaf and increased demand for facilities and infrastructure. In 2006, the government sponsored reconstruction of the previously demolished western area of the city as the City of Pilgrims project. Najaf, alongside Karbala, is considered a thriving pilgrimage destination for Shia Muslims and the pilgrimage industry in the city boomed after the end of Saddam Hussein's rule. However, due to the U.S. sanctions on Iran, the number of Iranian pilgrims dropped significantly.\nSince the end of the 2003–2011 war, numerous projects have been proposed for Najaf. The city has become a model for development in Iraq. Najaf have been experiencing economic boom, along with political events. In 2008, over 50% of about licensed 200 investment projects totaling $8 billion were under construction in Najaf Governorate, with most development coming in the housing and tourism sectors. Najaf has been described as a strategically important city with a stable investment environment and available skilled manpower. The city has experienced an increase in investment. Saudi Arabian firm ACWA Power is in process to construct a 1,000 MW solar power plant in Najaf.\n\nThe government proposed to build 15 housing complexes in Najaf, with a cost of $7 billion as a part of 240 projects. It also includes development of two industrial parks. In 2024, prime minister Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani announced several projects in the city, during his visit to Najaf. The projects proposed by Al-Sudani included the Holy shrine's carpet-washing factory project will cost 3.46 billion. A cement bag factory covering an area of 75,000 square meters with a production capacity of 240 million bags per year, is being constructed in Najaf. Another project is a glass production factory, which will have a net profit of 32% in the first year of operation because the Najaf desert region has high-quality raw materials for this factory.\n\nCulture\nReligious tourism\nNajaf being home to the Sanctuary of Imam Ali (considered the patriarch and the first of the Twelve Imams) is the destination of large numbers of Shi’i religious pilgrims annually hailing from around the world.\n\nSports\nThe city of Najaf is home to Al-Najaf SC and Naft Al-Wasat SC that play in the premier Iraq Stars League, and the second tier Iraqi Premier Division League, respectively.\nNajaf has two football stadiums, the An-Najaf Stadium (also referred to as the old stadium) with a capacity of 12,000 spectators, and the newer Al-Najaf International Stadium with a capacity of 30,000. The latter stadium is the home of the Stars League club Al-Najaf as well as  Naft Al-Wasat, whilst the former is the home stadium of the neighbouring Al-Kufa SC.\n\nEducation\nUniversities\nSome of the universities located in Najaf include:\n\nAl-Furat Al-Awsat Technical University\nIslamic University College\nUniversity of Alkafeel\nJabir Ibn Hayyan Medical University\nAltoosi University College\n\nNajaf Seminary\nThe Hawza of Najaf has been a centre of traditional Shia Islamic education since the 11th century CE. It was possibly established in the 9th century CE, making it the oldest Shi’i seminary among those still active, and many prominent Shi’i Islamic scholars have studied in the Najaf Seminary, including Murtadha al-Ansari, and Ali al-Sistani.\n\nInfrastructure\nNajaf International Airport is an important logistical hub that plays a pivotal role in facilitating transportation, particularly for religious tourism. Annually, it oversees the transit of over 3 million passengers, predominantly pilgrims visiting the holy sites in Najaf. It is situated in the eastern part of Najaf, approximately 6 kilometres from the city center.\nIn February 2024, the Iraqi National Investment Commission (NIC) unveiled a project to construct an inter-city high-speed rail connecting the cities of Najaf and Karbala. Once finished, it is set to accommodate up to 25,000 passengers per hour.\nThe construction of a road between the country and Saudi Arabia around the region of Najaf is about to complete.\n\nInternational relations\nSister cities\nAs of 2024, Najaf has three sister cities:\n\n Minneapolis, United States\n Najafabad, Iran\n\nSee also\n1977 Shia protests in Iraq\nAl-Hannanah mosque\nAl Najaf International Airport\nBattle of Najaf (2003)\nBattle of Najaf (2004)\nBattle of Najaf (2007)\nBig Four (Najaf)\nLiterary League Association\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nPublished in the 19th-20th centuries\nCharles Wilson, ed.

          "content": "The Imam Ali Shrine (Arabic: حَرَم ٱلْإِمَام عَلِيّ, romanized: Ḥaram al-ʾImām ʿAlī), also known as the Mosque of Ali (Arabic: مَسْجِد عَلِيّ, romanized: Masjid ʿAlī), is a Shi'ite mosque and shrine, located in Najaf, in the Najaf Governorate of Iraq. The site is a mausoleum which Shia and Sunni Muslims believe contains the tomb of Ali ibn Abi Talib, a cousin, son-in-law and companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The Shias consider Ali as their first imam and the first of the twelve caliphs of Muhammad, and the Sunnis regard him as the fourth Sunni Rashid Caliph. According to Shia belief, buried next to Ali within this mosque are the remains of Adam and Nuh (Noah). Each year, millions of pilgrims visit the shrine and pay tribute to Imam Ali.\nThe shrine monument has been built and rebuilt numerous times throughout history.\n\nHistory\nThe Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid built the first structure over the tomb of Imam Ali in 786 CE, which included a green dome. The Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil flooded the site in 850, but in the 10th century Abu'l-Hayja, the Hamdanid ruler of Mosul and Aleppo, rebuilt the shrine in 923, which included a large dome. In 979–980, the Shi'ite Buyid emir 'Adud al-Dawla expanded the shrine, which included a cenotaph over the burial site and a new dome. This included hanging textiles and carpets. He also protected Najaf with a wall and citadel, while providing water from the Euphrates via a qanat.\nThe Seljuq sultan Malik-Shah I contributed large gifts to the shrine in 1086, as did Caliph Al-Nasir.\nThe vizier Shams al-Din Juvayni added facilities to serve the pilgrims in 1267, and the sultan Ghazan Khan added the Dar al-Siyada wing for the sayyids in 1303.\nIbn Battuta visited the shrine in 1326, noting that it was \"carpeted with various sorts of carpets of silk and other materials, and contains candelabra of gold and silver, large and small.\" Between the three tombs, \"are dishes of gold and silver, containing rose-water, musk and various kinds of perfumes. The visitor dips his hand in this and anoints his face with it for a blessing.\" A fire destroyed the shrine in 1354, but it was rebuilt around 1358 by the Jalairid sultan Shaikh Awais Jalayir. He also interred his father's remains, Hasan Buzurg in the courtyard. Timur ordered the restoration of the shrine after a visit to Najaf. Suleiman the Magnificent also offered gifts, which probably helped restore the shrine, after a visit in 1534. The Safavid Shah Ismail I visited in 1508, but it was Abbas I who visited Najaf twice and commissioned 500 men to rebuild the shrine in 1623. The restoration was completed by his grandson Shah Safi al-Din in 1632. This restoration included a new dome, expanded courtyard, a hospital, kitchen, and hospice, so as to accommodate the numerous pilgrims. The cenotaph was restored in 1713 and the dome stabilized in 1716.\nIn 1742, Nader Shah gilded the dome and minaret, and this was chronicled by Nasrallah al-Haeri in his famous poem, iḏhā ḍhāmak al-dahra yawman wa jārā (Arabic: إذا ضامك الدهر يوماً وجارا). Nader Shah's wife paid for the walls and courtyard to be rebuilt and the retiling of the iwan faience. In 1745, the iwan was rebuilt as a gilt muqarnas of nine tiers. In 1791, a raised stone floor covered the tombs in the courtyard, creating a cellar space for them.\nThe first European visitors included Carsten Niebuhr in 1765, William Loftus in 1853, and Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1864.  The Ottoman emperor Abdülaziz rebuilt the Clock Portal (Bab al-Sa'a) and the Portal of Muslim Ibn 'Aqil in 1863 and the former gilded in 1888 by the Qajar sultan Naser al-Din Shah Qajar. In 1886, Sultan Naser al-Din, also repaired the dome because there were breaks in it due to the weather.\n\nIndependent Iraq\nDuring the uprising of March 1991, following the Persian Gulf War, Saddam Hussein's Republican Guards damaged the shrine, where members of the Shia opposition were cornered, in storming the shrine and massacring virtually all its occupants. Afterwards, the shrine was closed for two years, officially for repairs. Saddam Hussein also deported to Iran a large number of the residents of the area who were of Iranian descent.\nIn the three years after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the U.S. military, a number of violent incidents occurred at the mosque:\n\nApril 10, 2003: former Saddam Hussein era custodian Haydar Al-Killidar Al-Rufaye and anti-Saddam Shia leader Sayed Abdul Majid al-Khoei, the son of Grand Ayatollah Abu al Qasim al-Khoei, were killed by a mob near the mosque. Al-Khoei had returned from exile in Britain to encourage cooperation with the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq.\nAugust 29, 2003: the 2003 Imam Ali Shrine bombing. A car bomb exploded outside the mosque just as the main Friday prayers were ending. Somewhere between 85 and 125 people were killed, including the influential Ayatollah Sayed Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim, the Shia leader of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. The blast is thought to be the work of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\nMay 24, 2004: unidentified mortar fire hit the shrine, damaging gates which lead to the tomb of Imam Ali.\nAugust 5, 2004: Muqtada al-Sadr and the Mahdi Army seized the mosque and used it as a military base for launching attacks against the Iraqi police, the provincial government and coalition forces. The fighting was eventually ended by a peace agreement. Neighbouring buildings suffered considerable damage, but the mosque itself suffered only superficial damage from stray bullets and shrapnel.\nAugust 10, 2006: a suicide bomber blew himself up near the shrine, killing 40 people and injuring more than 50 others.\n\nArchitecture and decoration\nNumerous structures have existed over the tomb of Imam Ali since its discovery during the rule of Harun al Rashid in the 8th century.   The current structure though dates back to the Safavid period in the 17th century and was designed by the famous polymath Baha' al-din al-'Amili. The shrine consists of the central tomb chamber topped by a large double shell onion-shaped dome 42 metres (138 ft) high, and flanked by twin 38-metre-tall (125 ft) minarets. The inner shell of the dome is visible from the inside of the tomb chamber while the monumental outer shell is visible from the courtyard of the shrine and throughout the city. The inside of the tomb chamber and its surrounding halls are ornamented with an array of mirror mosaics, most of which has been replaced over the years and are not original. The ceramic mosaics that adorn the inner shell of the dome however are original and date back to the original construction of the shrine during the Safavid period. At the front of the shrine stands a large golden iwan flanked by two minarets. The monumental dome, iwan, and minarets are adorned with gold coated copper plates, though they were originally adorned with green and blue ceramic tiles in the typical Safavid fashion. The gilding of the shrines dome and façade elements occurred in 1743 under the orders of the Iranian king Nader Shah Afshar and his wife Razia Begum. The golden iwan, dome, and minarets contains numerous inscriptions in Persian, Arabic, and Azeri Turkish with poems in praise of Ali ibn Abi Talib inscriptions chronicling the gilding of the shrine by Nader Shah. The left and right side walls of the shrine are ornamented with cuerda seca tile panels most of which date from either the 18th or 19th centuries. Imam Ali's shrine is among the last of the Shi'ite shrines in Iraq to retains its nearly full set of original antique tiles.\nAround the shrine on its North, East, and Southern sides is a large courtyard surrounded by pointed arch arcades, while the shrine is linked on the West to the Al-Ra's Mosque. The courtyard arcades are two floors in height and contain various small chambers historically used as dormitory rooms for seminary students, today most are used as administrative offices. The Al-Ras mosque (literally \"The Head Mosque\") is oriented in the direction of the head of Ali Ibn Abi Talib's grave. The original Al-Ras mosque is said to have dated from the Ilhanate period in 14th century however it was demolished in 2005 by the shrine's administration and rebuilt in a modern style using contemporary construction materials and methods. Local architectural historians and preservationists have argued the destruction of the original Al-Ras mosque destroyed an important part of the shrine's architectural heritage and the introduction of modern construction methods and materials has damaged the architectural integrity of the shrine. The original Ilkhanate era mihrab of the Al-Ras mosque underwent restoration in 2023 after having been kept in storage for 18 years and will be put on display in the shrine's museum.\nEntrance to the shrine is through three main monumental iwans on the eastern, northern and southern sides, called the Main or Clock Portal, al-Tusi Portal and the Qibla Portal respectively. There are two additional monumental portals, the Portal of Muslim Ibn 'Aqil, north of the Clock Gate, and the al-'Amara, or al-Faraj Portal, at the southwestern corner. The most notable of these entry portals is the Clock Portal (Iwan-i-Sa'at) and is topped by a tall clock tower ornamented with mosaic tiles. The clock mechanism and its bells were produced in Manchester, England and brought to the shrine in 1887, this is visible on iron engravings on the bells.\n\nReligious status and precincts\nAs the burial site of one of Islam's most important figures, the Shrine of Imam Ali is considered by all Shia Muslims as the fourth holiest Islamic site. The Boston Globe reported \"for the Muslim Shias, Najaf is the fourth holiest city, behind Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Palestine.\" It is estimated that only Karbala, Mecca, and Medina receive more Muslim pilgrims. A hadith attributed to Ja'far as-Sādiq, the Sixth Imami Shī'ite Imām, mentions the site as one of \"five definitive holy places that we respect very much\".\nThe site is visited annually by at least 8 million pilgrims on average, which is estimated to increase to 20 million in years to come. Many Shiites believe that Ali did not want his grave to be desecrated by his enemies and consequently asked his friends and family to bury him secretly. This secret gravesite is supposed to have been revealed later during the Abbasid Caliphate by as-Sādiq. Most Shī'ites accept that Ali is buried in Imām Ali Mosque, in what is now the city of Najaf, which grew around the shrine.\nAs-Sādiq said that Imam Ali Mosque is the third of five holiest Islamic sites: Mecca, Medina, Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf, Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbalā, and the Shrine of his daughter Fāṭimah in Qom.\n\n\"God chose that land [Najaf] as the abode of the Prophets. I swear to God that no one more honourable than the Commander of the Believers [Ali] has ever lived there after (the time of) his purified fathers, Ādam and Nuh.\"\n\nGallery\nSee also\nHoliest sites in Shia Islam\nList of mosques in Iraq\nShia Islam in Iraq\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n\"Holy Shrine of Imam Ali\". wikishia.net.\n\"Imam Ali Holy Shrine\".

          "content": "Karbala is a major city in central Iraq. It is the capital of Karbala Governorate. With an estimated population of 691,100 people in 2024, Karbala is the second largest city in central Iraq, after Baghdad. The city is located about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Baghdad, and a few miles east of Lake Milh, also known as Razzaza Lake. Karbala is one of the main political, spiritual and cultural hubs of Shi'a Islam.\nThe city, best known as the location of the battle of Karbala in 680 AD between Husayn ibn Ali and his band of several dozen followers, including some armed women, and several thousand soldiers led by General Umar ibn Sa'd on behalf of Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, the local governor. With presence of the shrines of Hussain and Abbas, Karbala is considered a holy city for  Muslims. Soon, Karbala emerged as an important center of pilgrimage for Shiite Muslims across the world. During the Abbasid era, the city witnessed many events. After the fall of Baghdad in 1258, Karbala came under the control of Mongolian Empire led by Hulegu Khan. The city continued to be under multiple successive empires.\nTens of millions of Shi'ite Muslims visit the site twice a year. The martyrdom of Husayn ibn 'Ali and Abbas ibn 'Ali \nis commemorated annually by nearly 100 million Shi'ites in the city. Up to 34 million pilgrims visit the city to observe ʿĀshūrāʾ (the tenth day of Muharram), which marks the anniversary of Husayn's death, but the main event is the Arbaʿeen (the 40th day after 'Ashura'), where up to 40 million visit the graves. Most of the pilgrims travel on foot and come from all around Iraq and more than 56 countries.\n\nEtymology\nThere are many opinions among different investigators, as to the origin of the word Karbala. Some have pointed out that Karbala has a connection to the \"Karbalato\" language, while others attempt to derive the meaning of word by analyzing its spelling and language. They conclude that it originates from the \"Kar Babel\" group of ancient Babylonian villages that included Nainawa, Al-Ghadiriyya, Karbella (or Karb Illu), Al-Nawaweess, and Al-Heer. This last name is today known as Al-Hair and is where Husayn ibn Ali's grave is located.\nThe investigator Yaqut al-Hamawi had pointed out that the meaning of Karbala could have several explanations, one of which is that the place where Husayn ibn Ali was martyred is made of soft earth—al-Karbalāt.\nAnother theory suggests that this word originates from the Assyrian language and is a combination of two terms: \"karb\" (meaning proximity or sanctuary / cherub and cherubim) and \"ila\" (meaning God), thus signifying \"sanctuary of God\" or \"house of God.\" According to another theory, the word means \"great karb,\" and the element \"la\" in it should be compared to the ancient \"La\\Lu\" component found in Mesopotamian words (such as the word \"Lugal\"). In Shi'a Islamic tradition, there are also two hadiths from Ali ibn Abi Talib and the Prophet of Islam that establish a connection between Karbala and the concepts of \"karb\" (distress) and \"bala\" (affliction) in the first narration, as well as the event of Noah's flood—which is referred to in the Qur'an as \"great karb\"—in the second narration.\nAccording to Shia's belief, the archangel Gabriel narrated the true meaning of the name Karbala to Muhammad: a combination of karb (Arabic: كَرْب, \"the land which will cause many agonies\") and balāʾ (Arabic: بَلاء, \"afflictions\").\n\nHistory\nReligious significance\nMesopotamia has been mentioned in Quran. Some Shi'ites consider this verse of the Quran to refer to Iraq, the land of the Shi'ite sacred sites of Kufah, Najaf, Karbala, Kadhimiyyah and Samarra, since the Monotheistic preachers Ibrāhīm (Abraham) and Lūṭ (Lot), who are regarded as Prophets in Islam, are believed to have lived in the ancient Iraqi city of Kutha Rabba, before going to \"The Blessed Land\".\nThen We delivered him(Ibrahim), along with Lot, to the land We had showered with blessings for all people.\nAside from the story of Abraham and Lot in Polytheistic Mesopotamia, there are passages in the Quran about Mount Judi, Babil (\"Babylon\") and Qaryat Yunus (\"Town of Jonah\").\nThe tomb of the martyred Imam has acquired great significance in Shia tradition because he and his fellow martyrs are seen as models of jihad in the way of God. Shi'ites believe that Karbala is one of the holiest places on Earth according to the following traditions (among others):\nThe angel Gabriel narrated to Muhammad that:\n\nKarbala, where your grandson and his family will be martyred, is one of the most blessed and the most sacred lands on Earth, and it is one of the valleys of Paradise.\nThe fourth Shi'ite Imam, that is Zayn al-Abidin narrated:\n\nGod chose the land of Karbalā' as a safe and blessed sanctuary twenty-four thousand years before He created the land of the Ka'bah and chose it as a sanctuary. Verily it (Karbala) will shine among the gardens of Paradise like a shining star shines among the stars for the people of Earth.\nIn this regard, Ja'far al-Sadiq narrates, 'Allah, the Almighty, has made the dust of my ancestor's grave – Imam Husain (a.s) as a cure for every sickness and safety from every fear.' It is narrated from Ja'far that: \"The earth of the pure and holy grave of Husayn ibn ‘Ali (a.s) is a pure and blessed musk. For those who consume it, it is a cure for every ailment, and if our enemy uses it then he will melt the way fat melts, when you intend to consume that pure earth recite the following supplication\"\n\nBattle of Karbala\nThe Battle of Karbala was fought on the bare deserts on the way to Kufa on October 10, 680 AD (10 Muharram 61 AH). Both Husayn ibn Ali and his brother Abbas ibn Ali were buried by the local Banī Asad tribe, at what later became known as the Mashhad Al-Husayn. The battle itself occurred as a result of Husain's refusal of Yazid's demand for allegiance to his caliphate. The Kufan governor, Ubaydallah ibn Ziyad, sent thirty thousand horsemen against Husayn as he traveled to Kufa. Husayn had no army, he was with his family and few friends who joined them, so there were around 73 men, including the 6-month-old Ali Asghar, son of Imam Husayn, in total. The horsemen, under 'Umar ibn Sa'd, were ordered to deny Husayn and his followers water to force Husayn to agree to give an oath of allegiance. On the 9th of Muharram, Husayn refused, and requested to be given the night to pray. On the 10th day of Muharram, Husayn ibn Ali prayed the morning prayer and led his troops into battle along with his brother Abbas. Many of Husayn's followers, including all of his present sons Ali Akbar, Ali Asghar (six months old) and his nephews Qassim, Aun and Muhammad were killed.\nIn 63 AH (683 AD), Yazid ibn Mu'awiya released the surviving members of Husayn's family from prison as there was a threat of uprisings and some of the people in his court were unaware of who the battle was with, when they got to know that the descendants of Muhammad were killed, they were horrified. On their way to Mecca, they stopped at the site of the battle. There is a record of Sulayman ibn Surad going on pilgrimage to the site as early as 65 AH (685 AD). The city began as a tomb and shrine to Husayn ibn Ali, grandson of Muhammad and son of Ali ibn Abi Talib, and grew as a city to meet the needs of pilgrims. The city and tombs were greatly expanded by successive Muslim rulers, but suffered repeated destruction from attacking armies. The original shrine was destroyed by the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mutawakkil in 850 but was rebuilt in its present form around 979, only to be partly destroyed by fire in 1086 and rebuilt yet again.\n\nEarly modern\nDuring the period of Ottoman Iraq, Karbala, like Najaf, suffered from severe water shortages that were only resolved in the early 18th century by building a dam at the head of the Husayniyya Canal. In 1737, the city replaced Isfahan in Iran as the main center of Shia scholarship. In the mid-eighteenth century it was dominated by the dean of scholarship, Yusuf Al Bahrani, a key proponent of the Akhbari tradition of Shia thought, until he died in 1772, after which the more state-centric Usuli school became more influential.\nThe Wahhabi sack of Karbala occurred on 21 April 1802 (1216 Hijri) (1801), under the rule of Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad the second ruler of the First Saudi State, when 12,000 Wahhabi Muslims from Najd attacked the city of Karbala. The attack was coincident with the anniversary of Ghadir Khum event, or 10 Muharram. This fight left 3,000–5,000 deaths and the dome of the tomb of Husayn ibn Ali, was destroyed. The fight lasted for 8 hours.\nAfter the First Saudi State invasion, the city enjoyed semi-autonomy during Ottoman rule, governed by a group of gangs and mafia variously allied with members of the 'ulama. In order to reassert their authority, the Ottoman army laid siege to the city. On January 13, 1843, Ottoman troops entered the city. Many of the city leaders fled leaving defense of the city largely to tradespeople. About 3,000 Arabs were killed in the city, and another 2,000 outside the walls (this represented about 15% of the city's normal population). The Turks lost 400 men. This prompted many students and scholars to move to Najaf, which became the main Shia religious centre. Between 1850 and 1903, Karbala enjoyed a generous influx of money through the Oudh Bequest. The Shia-ruled Indian Province of Awadh, known by the British as Oudh, had always sent money and pilgrims to the holy city. The Oudh money, 10 million rupees, originated in 1825 from the Awadh Nawab Ghazi-ud-Din Haider. One third was to go to his wives, and the other two-thirds went to holy cities of Karbala and Najaf. When his wives died in 1850, the money piled up with interest in the hands of the British East India Company. The EIC sent the money to Karbala and Najaf per the wives' wishes, in the hopes of influencing the Ulama in Britain's favor. This effort to curry favor is generally considered to have been a failure.\n\nIn 1915, Karbala was the scene of an uprising against the Ottoman Empire. In 1928, an important drainage project was carried out to relieve the city of unhealthy swamps, formed between Hussainiya and the Bani Hassan Canals on the Euphrates.\nDefense of the City Hall in Karbala – a series of skirmishes fought from April 3 to April 6, 2004, between the Iraqi rebels of the Mahdi Army trying to conquer the city hall and the defending Polish and Bulgarian soldiers from the Multinational Division Central-South\nIn 2003 following the American invasion, the Karbala town council attempted to elect United States Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Lopez as mayor. Ostensibly so that his Marines, contractors, and funds could not leave.\nOn April 14, 2007, a car bomb exploded about 600 ft (180 m) from the shrine to Husayn, killing 47 and wounding over 150.\nOn January 19, 2008, 2 million Iraqi Shia pilgrims marched through Karbala city, Iraq to commemorate Ashura. 20,000 Iraqi troops and police guarded the event amid tensions due to clashes between Iraqi troops and Shia which left 263 people dead (in Basra and Nasiriya).\n\nGeography\nWith an impressive 3.9 million palm trees, Karbala produces approximately 160,000 tons of dates across 90 different varieties. Karbala has surpassed Saudi Arabia's Al-Ahsa Oasis, becoming the world's largest palm oasis.\n\nClimate\nKarbala experiences a hot desert climate (BWh in the Köppen climate classification) with extremely hot, long, dry summers and mild winters. Almost all of the yearly precipitation is received between November and April, though no month is wet.\n\nEconomy\nKarbala is a significant pilgrimage destination for Shia Muslims, especially during the Islamic holy month of Muharram. According to Azher Al-Kalash, Vice President of the Association of Hotels and Tourist Restaurants in Karbala, said, \"Karbala has the highest number of hotels in Iraq, with 900 hotels of various levels, equivalent to one-third of the total number of hotels in the entire country. Some hotels have safety and security concerns raised by the civil defense, but the most comply with the regulations and instructions.\"\nTourism in every country is influenced by supply and demand. Hence, hotel and transportation prices rise during peak times. In Karbala, the minimum hotel rate is around $10 per night, while the maximum can reach $50 during Ashura. However, the amount doubles during the Arbaeen pilgrimage due to the high demand. Arbaeen is the most significant pilgrimage that hotel owners rely on throughout the year.\" Thus, tourism plays an important role in stimulating various sectors, whether hotels, agriculture, trade, or others. It contributes to the employment of all economic sectors of society.\nKarbala Refinery, with a refining capacity of 140,000 barrels per day (bpd), it stands as Iraq's largest refining project in four decades. The refinery commenced commercial operations in mid-March 2024, initially operating at 60% capacity, with plans to reach full capacity by August 2024. It is estimated that the refinery produce 70% of country's petroleum products and generate $3bn in revenue.\n\nCulture\nReligious tourism\nKarbala, alongside Najaf, is considered a thriving tourist destination for Shia Muslims and the tourism industry in the city boomed after the end of Saddam Hussein's rule. Some religious tourism attractions include:\n\nAl Abbas Mosque\nImam Husayn Shrine\nEuphrates\nRuins of Mujada, about 40 km (25 miles) to the west of the city\nArbaeen is a massive annual pilgrimage event that takes place in Karbala. It is considered one of the largest peaceful gatherings in the world. In 2017, approximately 30 million people took part in the pilgrimage.\nThe official number of visitors during the 10-day period surpassed 22 million people on September 6, 2023, making it the largest and most peaceful gathering in the world. Shia Muslims largely attended the commemoration, as well as many Sunni Muslims and Christians who also visited to pay their respect to Imam Hussein.\nWho Is Hussain, a charity is based in Karbala, has accumulated around 50,000 blood donations, saved more than 140,000 lives and helped feed more than 700,000 people. During the period of Arbaeen, its teams provide voluntary initiatives around the world like donating blood, alongside distributing food, drink and masks to citizens, to countries including the United States, France, Britain, Pakistan, Lebanon as well as African and poverty-driven countries.”\n\nSports\nKarbala FC is a football club based in Karbala. It plays in the premier Iraq Stars League, the highest division of the Iraqi football league system.\nThe Karbala Sports City located south of Karbala city, is a large sports complex housing the Karbala International Stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators, a smaller football stadium with a capacity of 2,000, as well as a football field for training, a swimming hall, and a hotel.\n\nEducation\nUniversities\nUniversity of Karbala, which was inaugurated on March 1, 2002, is one of the top most universities in Iraq regarding academic administration, human resources, and scientific research. Ahl al-Bayt University was founded in September 2003 by Dr. Mohsen Baqir Mohammed-Salih Al-Qazwini. The university has six major colleges: College of Law, Arts, Islamic Sciences, Medical & Health Technology, Pharmacy and Dentistry.\nWarith al-Anbiya University in Karbala, sponsored by the Imam Husayn Holy Shrine, was established in 2017. It has the faculties of engineering, administration, economics, law and pathology. It received its first batch of students in the academic year 2017–2018.\n\nHawza Seminary\nThe Hawza are Islamic education institutions that are administered under the guidance of a Grand Ayatollah or group of scholars to teach Shia Muslims and guide them through the rigorous journey of becoming an Alim (a religious scholar). Initially Karbala's hawza consisted mostly of Iranians and Turkish scholars. The death of Sharif-ul-Ulama Mazandarani in 1830 as well as the repression of the Shia population by the Ottomans in 1843 both played a significant role in the relocation of many scholars to the city of Najaf, where a large Hawza had already existed. This move strengthened the role of the Hawza of Najaf as the center of Shia Islamic leadership and education. Today the Hawza Seminary still exists in Karbala (such as the School of Allamah Ibn Fahd) but to a lesser extent in comparison to Najaf.\n\nInfrastructure\nAirports\nAirports in Karbala include:\n\nKarbala Northeast Airport\nKarbala International Airport (located to the southeast of Karbala)\n\nInter-city high-speed railway system\nIn February 2024, the Iraqi National Investment Commission (NIC) unveiled a project to construct an inter-city high-speed rail connecting the cities of Karbala and Najaf. Once finished, it is set to accommodate up to 25,000 passengers per hour.\n\nInternational relations\nSister cities\nAs of 2020, Karbala has 2 sister cities:\n\n Mashhad, Iran\n Tabriz, Iran\n\nSee also\nBattle of Karbala\n1977 Shia uprising in Iraq\nBattle of Karbala (1991)\nBattle of Karbala (2003)\n2003 Karbala bombings\n2004 Ashura massacre\n2007 Karbala mosque bombings\nKarbala raid\nArba'een\nKarbala, Iran\n\nExplanatory notes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nPublished in the 19th century\nLouis de Sivry, ed.

          "content": "The Imam al Husayn Shrine (Arabic: مَقَام الإِمَامُ الْحُسَيْن اِبِنْ عَلي, romanized: Maqām al-ʾImām al-Ḥusayn ʾibn ʿAlī) is the mausoleum of Husayn ibn Ali and Shi'ite mosque, located in the holy city of Karbala, in the Karbala Governorate of Iraq. Husayn was a grandson of Muhammad, and the site is near the place where he embraced martyrdom during the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE. The tomb of Husayn is one of the holiest sites in Shia Islam, outside of Mecca and Medina, and many make pilgrimages to the site. Every year, millions of pilgrims visit the city to observe Ashura, which marks the commemoration of Husayn's death for all Muslims.\n\nDescription\nThe boundary wall of the shrine surrounds wooden gates covered with glass decorations. The gates open into a courtyard separated into smaller rooms or precincts with many \"iwans\" along the walls. The grave of Husayn is enclosed within a metal-mesh like structure, found directly beneath the golden dome. On 5 March 2013, the process of replacing the zarih (metal mesh like structure) over the tomb of Husayn was completed and the new zarih inaugurated. The Al Abbas Mosque is located nearby. Plans to replace the shrine's historic dome with a modern steel framed one were met with controversy, especially by historic preservationists, as it would severely distort the shrine's historic integrity and character.\nThe first dome is 27 metres (89 ft) high and completely covered with gold. At the bottom, it is surrounded with twelve windows, each of which is about 1.25 metres (4 ft 1 in) away from the other, from the inside, and 1.30 metres (4 ft 3 in) from the outside. The shrine has an area of 59 metres (194 ft) by 75 metres (246 ft) with ten gates, and about 65 decorated rooms used for studying.\n\nBurials\nThe grave of Husayn ibn Ali is found in the middle of the precinct, it is called the Rawḍah (\"garden\") and it has several doors. The most famous one is called Al-Qiblah or Bāb al-Zah'ab. On the right hand side of the entrance is the tomb of Habīb ibn Madhahir al-Asadī (حبیب ابن مظاهر الاسدی), a friend and companion of Husayn since their childhood and a casualty of the Battle of Karbala.\nWithin the shrine of Husayn can also be found a grave of all the 72 martyrs of Karbalā'. They were buried in a mass grave which was then covered with soil to the ground level. This mass grave is at the foot of Husayn's grave. Beside Husayn's grave, there are also the graves of his two sons: 'Alī al-Akbar and the six-month old, 'Alī al-Asghar. Along with the graves of the martyrs of Karbala, is also the grave of the very first custodian of Imam Husayn shrine, Ibrahim al-Mujab, grandson of seventh shi'ite Imam Musa al-Kazim.\n\nHistory\nHusayn bought a piece of land after his arrival at Karbala' from Bani Asad. He and his Ahl al-Bayt are buried in that portion, known as Arabic: الحائر, romanized: al-Ḥā'ir, where the shrines are presently located. The history of destruction and reconstruction of the shrines of Karbala' is long. Both the shrines were greatly extended by successive Muslim rulers, but suffered repeated destruction from attacking armies. Several rulers extended, decorated and kept the shrines and its precincts in good condition. Among them is Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, who in 1250 AH ordered the construction of two shrines, one over Husayn's grave and the other over the grave of his half-brother, Abbas ibn Ali. \nFrom the time of Husayn ibn Ali's death in 680, pilgrimages to commemorate the massacre have often been repressed. Despite many attempts by successive rulers, such as Al-Rashīd and Al-Mutawakkil, to put a restriction on the development of the area, it has nonetheless evolved into a city.\nThe historian Ibn Kuluwayh mentioned that those who buried Husayn ibn 'Alī constructed a special, durable identifying marker for the gravesite.\nLarger, more significant construction on the gravesite began during the rule of al-Saffah (r. 750–754 CE), the first caliph of the long-lasting Abbasid caliphate (an Islamic dynasty). However, heavy restrictions were put in place to prevent people from visiting the grave during the rule of Hārūn al-Rashīd, the fifth Abbasid caliph (r. 786–809 CE).\nDuring the rule of al-Mā'mūn, the seventh Abbasid caliph (r. 813–833 CE), gravesite construction resumed until the year 850 CE, when al-Mutawakkil ordered the destruction of the grave and the filling of the resulting pit with water. His son who succeeded him as caliph, al-Muntasir, allowed people to visit the gravesite, and since then, building the precinct to the grave increased and developed step by step.\nOn the other hand, the historian Ibn al-Athir, stated that in 371 AH (981/982CE), 'Adhud ad-Dawlah became the first to expansively lay the foundations for large-scale construction and to generously decorate the place. He also built houses and markets around the precinct, and surrounded Karbalā with a high boundary wall, turning it into a strong castle.\nIn 407 AH (1016/1017CE), the precinct caught fire due to the dropping of two large candles on the wooden decorations. The state minister at the time, Hasan ibn Fadl, rebuilt the damaged sections.\n\nTimeline\nThe following events are in chronological order, stating instances that widely involved the shrine, impressing its construction, renovation and series of extremist activities that reduced its structure and killed pilgrims from time to time.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nShia Islam in Iraq\nHoliest sites in Shia Islam\nList of the oldest mosques in the world\nList of mosques in Iraq\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nAghaie, Kamran Scot (2004).

          "content": "The Citadel of Erbil (Kurdish: قەڵای هەولێر Qelay Hewlêr, Arabic: قلعة اربيل, romanized: Qal'at Erbīl), locally called Qellat,  is a tell or occupied mound, and the historical city centre of Erbil in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The citadel was added to the World Heritage List on 21 June 2014.\nThe earliest evidence for occupation of the citadel mound dates to the 5th millennium BC, and possibly earlier. It appears for the first time in historical sources in the Ebla tablets in modern Syria around 2000 BC, and gained particular importance during the Neo-Assyrian period. During the Sassanian period and the Abbasid Caliphate, Erbil was an important centre for Christianity. After the Mongols captured the citadel in 1258, the importance of Erbil declined. During the 20th century, the urban structure was significantly modified, as a result of which a number of houses and public buildings were destroyed.\nThe buildings on top of the tell stretch over a roughly oval area of 430 by 340 metres (1,410 ft × 1,120 ft) occupying 102,000 square metres (1,100,000 sq ft). The only religious structure that currently survives is the Mulla Afandi Mosque. The mound rises between 25 and 32 metres (82 and 105 ft) from the surrounding plain.\n\nHistory\nPrehistory\nThe site of the citadel may have been occupied as early as the Neolithic period, as pottery fragments possibly dating to that period have been found on the slopes of the mound. Clear evidence for occupation comes from the Chalcolithic period, with sherds resembling pottery of the Ubaid and Uruk periods in the Jazira and southeastern Turkey, respectively. Given this evidence for early occupation, the citadel has been called the oldest continuously occupied town in the world.\n\nEarliest historical records\nErbil appears for the first time in literary sources around 2300 BC in the archives of Ebla. According to Giovanni Pettinato, it is mentioned in two tablets as Irbilum.\nThe city was first largely under Sumerian domination from c. 3000 BC, until the rise of the Akkadian Empire (2335–2154 BC) which united all of the Akkadian Semites and Sumerians of Mesopotamia under one rule. Later, Erridupizir, king of Gutium, captured the city in 2200 BC.\nAt the end of the 3rd millennium BC, Erbil is mentioned in historical records of the Ur III period as Urbilum. King Shulgi destroyed Urbilum in his 43rd regnal year, and during the reign of his successor Amar-Sin, Urbilum was incorporated into the Ur III state. In the 18th century BC, Erbil appears in a list of cities that were conquered by Shamshi-Adad of Upper Mesopotamia and Dadusha of Eshnunna during their campaign against the land of Qabra. Shamshi-Adad installed garrisons in all the cities of the land of Urbil. During the 2nd millennium BC, Erbil was incorporated into Assyria. Erbil served as a point of departure for military campaigns toward the east.\n\nFrom the Neo-Assyrian period to the Sassanids\nErbil was an important city during the Neo-Assyrian period. The city took part in the great revolt against Shamshi-Adad V that broke out over the succession of Shalmaneser III. During the Neo-Assyrian period, the name of the city was written as Arbi-Ilu, meaning 'Four Gods'. Erbil was an important religious centre that was compared with cities such as Babylon and Assur. Its goddess Ishtar of Erbil was one of the principal deities of Assyria, often named together with Ishtar of Nineveh. Her sanctuary was repaired by the kings Shalmaneser I, Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal. Inscriptions from Assurbanipal record oracular dreams inspired by Ishtar of Erbil. Assurbanipal probably held court in Erbil during part of his reign and received there envoys from Rusa II of Urartu after the defeat of the Elamite ruler Teumman.\nAfter the end of the Assyrian Empire, Erbil was first controlled by the Medes and then incorporated into the Achaemenid Empire before it became part of the empire of Alexander the Great after the Battle of Gaugamela, which was fought near Erbil in 331 BC. Subsequently, after the partition of Alexander the Great's Empire by his generals (known as Diadochoi), the city was called Arabella or Arbela and it was part of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire. After the 1st century BCE, the Roman and Parthian Empire fought over control of Erbil, or Arbira as it was known in that period. After the 1st century AD, Arbela became an important Christian center. During the Sassanid period, Erbil was the seat of a satrap (governor). In 340 AD, Christians in Erbil were persecuted and in 358, the governor became a martyr after he converted to Christianity. A Nestorian school was founded in Erbil by the School of Nisibis in c. 521. During this period, Erbil was also the site of a Zoroastrian fire temple.\n\nMuslim conquest until the Ottomans\nErbil was conquered by the Muslims in the 7th century. It remained an important Christian center until the 9th century, when the bishop of Erbil moved his seat to Mosul. In the middle of the 10th century, Erbil came under the rule of Hadhabani Kurds until 1063 when it was taken over by the Seljuk Turks. From the first half of the 12th century until 1233, Erbil was the seat of the Begteginids, a Turcoman dynasty that rose to prominence under the reign of Zengi, the atabeg of Mosul. In 1183, Zain ad-Din Yusuf, ruler of Erbil, shifted his allegiance to the Kurdish Ayyubid Sultanate. In 1190 when Zain ad-Din Yusuf died, his older brother Muzaffar al-Din Gökböri, who was previously governor of Edessa, became the new governor of Erbil. He created a lower town around the city on the citadel mound and founded hospitals and madrasahs. When Gökböri died in 1233 without an heir, control of Erbil shifted to the Abbasid Caliph al-Mustansir after he had besieged the city.\n\nMongols\nWhen the Mongols invaded the Near East in the 13th century, they attacked Erbil for the first time in 1237. They plundered the lower town but had to retreat before an approaching caliphal army and had to put off the capture of the citadel. After the fall of Baghdad to Hülegü and the Mongols in 1258, they returned to Erbil and were able to capture the citadel after a siege lasting six months. Hülegü then appointed a Christian governor to the town and there was an influx of Jacobite Christians, who were allowed to build a church.\nAs time passed, persecutions of Christians, Jews and Buddhists throughout the Ilkhanate began in earnest in 1295 under Oïrat amir Nauruz. This manifested early on in the reign of the Ilkhan Ghazan. In 1297, after Ghazan had felt strong enough to overcome Nauruz' influence, he put a stop to the persecutions.\nDuring the reign of the Ilkhan Öljeitü some of the Christian inhabitants retreated to the citadel to escape persecution. In the spring of 1310, the Malik (governor). Despite Mar Yahballaha's best efforts to avert the impending doom, the citadel was at last taken by Ilkhanate troops on 1 July 1310, and all the defenders were massacred, as were all the Kurdish inhabitants of the lower town.\nAfter Battle of Chaldiran in 1514, Erbil came under control of Soran emirate, a semi-independent Kurdish emirate under the Ottoman Empire. In the 18th century Baban Emirate took the city but it was retaken by Soran ruler Mir Muhammad Pasha of Rawanduz in 1822. The Soran emirate continued ruling over Erbil until it was retaken by the Ottoman Turks in 1851. Erbil became part of the Mosul Vilayet in Ottoman Empire until World War I, when the Ottomans were defeated by the British Empire. The town had approximately 3,200 inhabitants, including a sizeable Jewish minority.\n\nModern period\nDuring the 20th century, the citadel witnessed significant urban and social changes. A 15-metre (49 ft) high steel water tank was erected on the citadel in 1924, providing the inhabitants with purified water, but also causing water damage to the foundations of the buildings due to increased water seepage. The number of inhabitants gradually declined over the 20th century as the city at the foot of the citadel grew and wealthier inhabitants moved to larger, modern houses with gardens. In 1960, over 60 houses, a mosque, and a school were demolished to make way for a straight road connecting the southern gate with the northern gate. Some reconstruction works were carried out in 1979 on the citadel's southern gate and the hammam. In 2007, the remaining 840 families were evicted from the citadel as part of a large project to restore and preserve the historic character of the citadel. These families were offered financial compensation. One family was allowed to continue living on the citadel to ensure that there would be no break in the possible 8,000 years of continuous habitation of the site, and the government plans to have 50 families live in the citadel once its renovated. In 2004, the Kurdish Textile Museum opened its doors in a renovated mansion in the southeast quarter of the citadel.\n\nThe Citadel and the Bazaar\nThe city of Erbil is defined by the central circular mound that is the citadel, 102,000 square metres of land raised 26 metres above the surrounding city, presumed to have been started in antiquity as a tell. Around and beneath it to the south sprawl a maze of alleyways where the ancient commercial heart of the city beats strongly to this day. The citadel dwellings still stand, although they are now vacated as part of the UNESCO development project to renovate the buildings. The market area below is thought to have been created in the time of Sultan Muzafferddin Kokberi (1190–1233). This period, the only time in its long history when Erbil flourished as an independent city state, also saw the creation of the Mudhafaria Minaret in downtown Erbil, and was also the time when the Muzafferddin madrassahs (schools) were founded.\nThe area around the southern base of the citadel has received the attention of modern town planners, with the large open-air Lana market where once market stalls sold leather crafts now and replaced by a large modern shopping mall. The covered market, known as Qasariyah, still stands largely unchanged: A labyrinth of small alleyways protected from sun and rain by a latticework of corrugated iron. Beneath these eaves are the numerous shopkeepers selling wares largely imported from the Far East interspersed with craftsmen plying a trade they inherited from their forefathers in the late nineteenth century when the bazaar was restored: Jewellers, cobblers, carpenters, tinsmiths and butchers. Where possible, tradesmen gather alongside others who trade in the same wares, giving each alleyway a specialism such as the passageway towards the north-east corner where honey and dairy products are sold – yoghurts and cheeses piling the highly valued local honey. Another highly prized tradition is the creation of Klash shoes – an ancient uniquely Kurdish craft when white cloth is beaten on small anvils to create hardwearing footwear. These, and the traditional fabrics sold in the textile souk, are ever-popular in the run-up to the annual Newroz celebrations when the townspeople assume traditional attire.\n\nArchitecture and layout\nThe citadel is situated on a large tell – or settlement mound – of roughly oval shape that is between 25 and 32 metres (82 and 105 ft) high. The area on top of the mound measures 430 by 340 metres (1,410 ft × 1,120 ft) and is 102,000 square metres (1,100,000 sq ft) large. Natural soil has been found at a depth of 36 metres (118 ft) below the present surface of the mound. The angle of the citadel mound's slopes is c. 45°. Three ramps, located on the northern, eastern and southern slopes of the mound, lead up to gates in the outer ring of houses. The southern gate was the oldest and was rebuilt at least once, in 1860, and demolished in 1960. The current gate house was constructed in 1979. The eastern gate is called the Harem Gate and was used by women. It seems unclear when the northern gate was opened. One source claims that it was opened in 1924, while another observes that there were only two gates in 1944 – the southern and eastern gates.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, there were three mosques, two schools, two takyas and a hammam on the citadel. The citadel also housed a synagogue until 1957. The only religious structure that currently survives is the Mulla Afandi Mosque, which was rebuilt on the location of an earlier 19th-century mosque. The hammam was built in 1775 by Qassim Agha Abdullah. It went out of service during the 1970s and was renovated in 1979, although many original architectural details were lost.\nWhen it was still occupied, the citadel was divided in three districts or mahallas: from east to west the Serai, the Takya and the Topkhana. The Serai was occupied by notable families; the Takya district was named after the homes of dervishes, which are called takyas; and the Topkhana district housed craftsmen and farmers. A 1920 inventory showed that at that time the citadel was divided into 506 house plots. Since then the number of houses and inhabitants has gradually declined. For example, in 1984 4,466 people lived in 375 houses, whereas a 1995 census showed that the citadel had only 1,631 inhabitants living in 247 houses. Until the opening-up of the main north–south thoroughfare, the streets on the citadel mound radiated outward from the southern gate like the branches of a tree. Streets were between 1 and 2.5 metres (3 ft 3 in and 8 ft 2 in) wide and ranged in length from 300 metres (980 ft) for major alleyways to 30–50 metres (98–164 ft) for cul-de-sacs.\n\nThe perimeter wall of the citadel is not a continuous fortification wall, but consists of the façades of approximately 100 houses that have been built against each other. Because they have been built on or near the steep slope of the citadel mound, many of these façades were strengthened by buttresses to prevent their collapse or subsidence. There were circa 30 city-palaces; most of them located along the perimeter of the citadel. The oldest surviving house that can be securely dated through an inscription was built in 1893. The oldest houses can be found on the southeastern side of the mound, whereas houses on the northern perimeter date to the 1930s–1940s. Before the introduction of modern building techniques, most houses on the citadel were built around a courtyard. A raised arcade overlooking the courtyard, a flat roof and a bent-access entrance to prevent views of the courtyard and the interior of the house were characteristic elements of the houses on the citadel.\n\nResearch and restoration\nIn 2006 and 2007, a team from the University of West Bohemia, together with Salahaddin University in Arbil, carried out an extensive survey and evaluation of the entire citadel. As part of this project, geodetic measurements of the citadel were taken and these were combined with satellite imagery, regular photographic imagery and aerial photographs to create a map and digital 3D model of the citadel mound and the houses on top of it. Geophysical prospection was carried out in some areas of the citadel to detect traces of older architecture buried under the present houses. Archaeological investigations included an archaeological survey on the western slope of the citadel mound, and the excavation of a small test trench in the eastern part of the citadel.\nin 2012, the Higher Committee for the Maintenance and Rehabilitation of the Erbil Citadel decided to conduct excavation searching for the remains of the wall and the historical fortifications of the citadel. The excavations took place in four seasons 2013-2014-2015. A part of the citadel wall of Erbil was discovered which was not previously visible. Not much was known about it until then, with only passing references in historical writings mentioning that the wall was surrounding the citadel, which enabled the inhabitants of the citadel to defend it against the attacks of enemies and invaders.\nA Neo-Assyrian chamber tomb was found at the foot of the citadel mound during construction activities in 2008. It was subsequently excavated by the local Antiquities Service and archaeologists from the German Archaeological Institute (DAI). The tomb was plundered in antiquity but still contained pottery dating to the 8th and 7th centuries BC. The cooperation between the Antiquities Service and the DAI was continued later that year with a further investigation of the tomb and with a small excavation nearby and geophysical survey of the surrounding area, in which also students from Salahaddin University participated. These investigations revealed the presence of architecture probably dating to the Neo-Assyrian period, as well as more burials belonging to subsequent centuries.\n\nIn 2007, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) established the High Commission for Erbil Citadel Revitalization (HCECR) to preserve and restore the citadel with the help of UNESCO. Among other things, the HCECR advocates the establishment of a zone extending up to 300–400 metres (980–1,310 ft) from the citadel in which building height should be restricted to approximately 10 metres (33 ft). This would ensure the visual dominance of the citadel over its surroundings.\nOn 2 April 2019, NASA described the historic citadel as possibly the oldest continuously occupied human settlement on Earth.\n\nUNESCO World Heritage status\nOn 8 January 2010, the HCECR and the Iraqi State Board for Antiquities and Heritage (SBAH) submitted the Citadel of Erbil to the Iraqi Tentative List of sites that are considered for nomination as World Heritage Site. The submission states that \"The Citadel is today one of the most dramatic and visually exciting cultural sites not only in the Middle East but also in the world.\" Two further agreements between the HCECR and UNESCO were signed in March 2010, and it was disclosed that Arbil Governorate will finance the restoration project with US$13 million. The first restoration works were carried out in June 2010. The Citadel was inscribed on the World Heritage List on 21 June 2014. In January 2017, UNESCO indicated that the site could be removed from the list due to the slow progress being made in the restoration program.\n\nPlaces to visit at the Citadel\nThe Kurdish Textile and Cultural Museum\nThe French Institute of the Near East (French: Institut français du Proche-Orient, IFPO)\nErbil Citadel Cultural Center\nTraditional Hammam (public bath)\nGreat Mosque (Mulla Effendi Mosque)\nErbil Stones and Gems Museum\nTurkmen Heritage House\nExhibition of Miniature of Kurdistan Costumes\nKurdistan Music Archive\nBarzani Museum\nErbil Citadel Interpretation Center\nExhibition of Handmade Carpets\nMulla Ibrahim Dogramachi Mosque\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of castles in Iraq\n\nReferences\nSources\nCahen, Cl.

Until this discovery, Cro-Magnons, the earliest known H. sapiens in Europe, were the only individuals known for purposeful, ritualistic burials.\n\nArchaeology\nThe Shanidar Cave site is located near Rowanduz, positioned about 0.5 miles (800 m) from the Great Zab river, and situated at an elevation of 2,100 feet (640 m) above sea level. The cave’s entrance is triangular, and the portal is 82 feet (25 m) wide by 26 feet (7.9 m) high. The cave’s dimensions are 130 feet (40 m) long, 175 feet (53 m) wide, and 45 feet (14 m) high.\nAnthropologist Ralph Solecki, who was part of the University of Michigan Expedition to the Near East, first explored the site with a sounding in 1951. He returned in 1953, under the auspices of the Directorate General of Antiquities of Iraq and the Smithsonian Institution, for another sounding. The first human remains, believed to be those of a Neanderthal infant from the Mousterian era of the Middle Paleolithic period, were discovered in 1953.\nThe next season, during 1956–57, Solecki and his team conducted soundings at two nearby village sites and continued work at the Shanidar Cave. Three Neanderthal unfossilized skeletons were found at the cave. One was nearly complete (Shanidar I - field catalog no. 504 III), one was fragmentary (Shanidar III - field catalog no. 384 III), and for one only the skull was excavated at that time (Shanidar II - field catalog no. 618 III). Archaeologists also uncovered the Neolithic remains of an infant and a female adolescent, buried with grave goods. The pair is believed to represent a mother and her child, who may have died during childbirth or due to a postpartum infection.   Frequent use of explosives, up to eight sticks at a time, were employed in these excavations.\nDuring the fourth season of 1960, a largely complete adult Neanderthal skeleton was recovered (Shanidar IV). Its state was considerably more fragile than the earlier specimens. While extracting it, the bones of another Neanderthal specimen, or possibly two, were noted and tentatively designated Shanidar VI. The former was presumed male and the latter female based on size. The badly damaged and scattered remains of one adult Neanderthal male was designated Shanidar V.\n\nAfter the field material had been processed and analyzed, more Neanderthal remains were declared. Shanidar 9 was an infant represented only by vertebrae. The remains of Shanidar 9 were discovered during the removal of Shanidar 4 when encasing it in sediment block and transporting it to the Baghdad Museum. Shanidar 8 was an adult with a partial fragmentary skeleton. Shanidar 6 and 7 were skull, teeth and partial skeleton, all fragmentary. Shanidar 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 were found as individual burials, while the other remains were found in a single compressed block.Overall these excavations found the remains of seven adult and two infants Neanderthals, dating from around 65,000–35,000 years ago. These individuals were uncovered amongst a Mousterian layer (layer D), overlaid by a Baradostian culture layer (layer C), a Mesolithic Zarzian layer (layer B) and a Holocene Neolithic layer (layer A), accompanied by various stone tools and animal remains. The cave also contains two later proto-Neolithic cemeteries, one of which dates back about 10,600 BCE and contains 35 individuals, and is considered by Solecki to belong to the Natufian culture. Also, in 2018, Shanidar-11 and Shanidar-12 were discovered.\n\nRecent work\nInvestigations were conducted in 2014-2015 under the auspices of the Kurdistan Directorate of Antiquities. The remains found in the Shanidar cave are being reexamined to analyze the mortuary activity of the Neanderthal people who inhabited this area. There are various signs of activity with the remains after death being that the position of the skull and mandible of Shanidar 1 were not natural. Examinations of other sites will be integral in understanding and analyzing the activity of the remains after death of those found in the Shanidar cave. Additional work is being conducted on the faunal remains found in Layer D at the University of Chicago to analyze butchery activity. Many remains found had cut marks that were caused by flint items which correlates to butchery practices.\n\nNeanderthal remains\nThe ten Neanderthals at the site were found within a Mousterian layer which also contained hundreds of stone tools including points, side-scrapers, and flakes and bones from animals including wild goats and spur-thighed tortoises.\nThe first nine (Shanidar 1–9) were unearthed between 1957 and 1961 by Ralph Solecki and a team from Columbia University. The skeleton of Shanidar 3 is held at the Smithsonian Institution. The others (Shanidar 1, 2, and 4–8) were kept in Iraq and may have been lost during the 2003 invasion, although casts remain at the Smithsonian. In 2006, while sorting a collection of faunal bones from the site at the Smithsonian, Melinda Zeder discovered leg and foot bones from a tenth Neanderthal, now known as Shanidar 10.\n\nShanidar 1\nShanidar 1 was an elderly Neanderthal male known as 'Nandy' to his excavators. He was aged between 30 and 45 years. Shanidar 1 had a cranial capacity of 1,600 cm3, was around the height of 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm), and displayed severe signs of deformity. He was one of four reasonably complete skeletons from the cave which displayed trauma-related abnormalities, which in his case would have been debilitating to the point of making day-to-day life painful.\nDuring the course of the individual's life, he had suffered a violent blow to the left side of his face, creating a crushing fracture to his left orbit which would have left him partially or totally blind in one eye. Research by Ján Lietava shows that the individual exhibits \"atypically worn teeth\". Severe changes to the individual's incisors and a flattened capitulum show additional evidence towards Shanidar 1 suffering from a degenerative disease. Additionally, analysis shows that Shanidar 1 likely suffered from profound hearing loss, as his left ear canal was partially blocked and his right ear canal was completely blocked by exostoses. He also suffered from a withered right arm which had been fractured in several places. A fracture of the individual's C5 vertebrae is thought to have caused damage to his muscle function (specifically the deltoids and biceps) of the right arm. Shanidar 1 healed, but this caused the loss of his lower arm and hand. This is thought to be either congenital, a result of childhood disease and trauma, or due to an amputation later in his life. The sharp point caused by a distal fracture of the individual's right humerus points towards this theory of amputation.  If the arm was amputated, this demonstrates one of the earliest signs of surgery on a living individual. The arm had healed, but the injury may have caused some paralysis down his right side, leading to deformities in his lower legs and feet. Studies show that this individual had suffered from two broken legs. This would have resulted in him walking with a pronounced, painful limp. These findings in Shanidar 1's skeleton propose that he was unlikely to be able to provide for himself in a Neanderthal society.\nMore recent analysis of Shanidar 1 by Washington University Professor Erik Trinkaus and Dr. Sébastien Villotte of the French National Centre for Scientific Research confirm that bony growths in his ear canals would have resulted in extensive hearing loss. These bony growths support a diagnosis of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), also known as Forestier's disease. This diagnosis would make Shanidar 1 the oldest hominin specimen clearly presenting this systemic condition. The researchers found these bone growths in multiple places all over the partial skeleton.\nBased on the healing of his injuries, Shanidar 1 lived with them for a substantial time before his death. Assuming that Neanderthals did perform surgery on Shanidar 1, his recovery demonstrates that their methods were successful in sustaining life. The prolonged survival of an individual with significant disabilities has also provided the basis for conjecture about Neanderthal social behavior. According to paleoanthropologist Erik Trinkaus, Shanidar 1 must have been aided by others in order to survive his injuries. Due to the chronic effects of trauma, it was unlikely that this individual could independently provide for his family, so his post-injury lifespan may imply that he was kept alive due to his high social status or valuable cultural knowledge.\nThis evidence has also led to speculation about Neanderthals' capacity for altruistic behavior and the presence of ethos in the Neanderthal communities. The discovery of stone tools found in proximity to these individuals demonstrates that Neanderthals exhibited the intelligence to make everyday life easier for themselves, and their cognitive ability may have surpassed basic comprehension to include characteristics such as humility and compassion commonly associated with Homo sapiens. These individuals may have exhibited empathy or attached abstract meaning to life that caused them to want to help Shanidar 1.\n\nShanidar 2\nShanidar 2 was a Neanderthal male around the age of 30 who suffered from slight arthritis, found lying on his right side. It is estimated that Shanidar 2 was 5 feet 2 inches (157 cm) in stature, which places him just below the average height of a male Neanderthal. He was killed by rocks falling from the cave's ceiling, which crushed his skull and bones significantly. The skull had been compressed by about 5–6 cm (2.0–2.4 in). Much of his bones were missing when discovered, and the left tibia had teeth marks. Scavengers likely disposed of parts of his remains. There is evidence that Shanidar 2 was given a ritual send-off: a small pile of stones with some worked stone points (made out of chert) were found on top of his grave. Also, there had been a large fire by the burial site.\nShanidar 2 had a \"higher cranial vault\", and other skull proportions that did not quite match up to the average Neanderthal skull. This may prove that the Neanderthals of Shanidar had more of a \"morphology of anatomically modern humans\" than other Neanderthals, or that the group was very diverse. This points to similarities between the two species, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, but it does not show any inherited \"relationships within that species\".\n\nShanidar 3\nShanidar 3 was a 40- to 50-year-old male, found in the same grave as Shanidar 1 and 2. A wound to the left 9th rib suggests that the individual died of complications from a stab wound by a sharp implement. Bone growth around the wound indicates that Shanidar 3 lived for at least several weeks after the injury with the object still embedded. The angle of the wound rules out self-infliction, but is consistent with an accidental or purposeful stabbing by another individual. Recent research has suggested that the injury may have been caused by a long range projectile. This would be the earliest example of inter-personal or inter-specific violence in the human fossil record and the only such example amongst Neanderthals. The presence of early-modern humans, possibly armed with projectile weapons, in western Asia around the same time has been taken to imply that this injury may have resulted from inter-species conflict. However, spears produced by Neanderthals 300,000-400,000 years BP were likely used as projectiles. Shanidar 3 also suffered from a degenerative joint disorder in his foot resulting from a fracture or sprain, which would have resulted in painful, limited movement. The skeleton is on display at the Hall of Human Origins at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.\n\nShanidar 4, the \"flower burial\"\nThe skeleton of Shanidar 4, an adult male aged 30–45 years, was discovered by Solecki in 1960, positioned on his left side in a partial fetal position.\nFor many years, Shanidar 4 was thought to provide strong evidence for a Neanderthal burial ritual. Routine soil samples from around the body, gathered for pollen analysis in an attempt to reconstruct the palaeoclimate and vegetational history of the site, were analysed eight years after its discovery. In two of the soil samples in particular, whole clumps of pollen were discovered by Arlette Leroi-Gourhan in addition to the usual pollen found throughout the site, suggesting that entire flowering plants (or at least heads of plants) had been part of the grave deposit. Furthermore, a study of the particular flower types suggested that the flowers may have been chosen for their specific medicinal properties. Yarrow, cornflower, bachelor's button, St Barnaby's thistle, ragwort, grape hyacinth, horsetail and hollyhock were represented in the pollen samples, all of which have been traditionally used, as diuretics, stimulants, and astringents and anti-inflammatories. This led to the idea that the man could have had shamanic powers, perhaps acting as medicine man to the Shanidar Neanderthals.\nHowever, recent work has suggested that the pollen was perhaps introduced to the burial by animal action, as several burrows of a gerbil-like rodent known as the Persian jird were found nearby. The jird is known to store large numbers of seeds and flowers at certain points in their burrows and this argument was used in conjunction with the lack of ritual treatment of the rest of the skeletons in the cave to suggest that the Shanidar 4 burial had natural, not cultural, origins. Paul B. Pettitt has stated that the \"deliberate placement of flowers has now been convincingly eliminated\", noting that \"A recent examination of the microfauna from the strata into which the grave was cut suggests that the pollen was deposited by the burrowing rodent Meriones persicus, which is common in the Shanidar microfauna and whose burrowing activity can be observed today\". Despite his conclusions that flowers were unlikely to have been deliberately placed, Petitt nevertheless concludes that the Shanidar burials, because they happened over so many years, represent a deliberate mortuary practice by Neanderthals. It has also been suggested that some of the pollen was deposited by nesting solitary bees.\n\nShanidar 5\nThe Shanidar 5 remains were found during the 1960 excavations, in layer D, about 4.5 meters below datum. He was an adult Neanderthal, thought to be male and around 40–50 years of age before death. He was caught in the same rockfall that killed Shanidar 2. Recovered were a cranium, 4 teeth, 1 vertebrae, 8 ribs, and miscellaneous other bones. The arrangement of the broken skeletal remains was thought to have been due to animals intervening after death.  Radiocarbon results put the date at about 46,000 before the present day. Some years later a small correction to the original cranial reconstruction was found. During the recent excavations more pieces of Shanidar 5 were found\nThe cranium of Shanidar 5 was reconstructed by Erik Trinkaus and his colleagues beginning 1976 and was finalized in 1994 after correcting a couple of errors caught in the process. During the process of reconstruction, there were discussions suggesting signs of intentional cranial deformation. Erik Trinkaus suggested that Shanidar 5 had its cranium deformed intentionally as an infant. However, this implication was overruled due to the fact that the curve was missing after the correction of a misplaced cranium bone fragment. Still, the frontal mid sagittal angle of this individual was very flat at 147º. The cranium shows signs of endocranial hyperostosis where plaques are found in the left and right side of the frontal crest and in the front area of sagittal sinus.\n\nShanidar Z\nIn February 2020, researchers announced the discovery of more Neanderthal remains, which dated back to more than 70,000 years ago. Analysis of the site found that Shanidar Z was laid to rest in a gully that had been formed by hand for the placement of the body. The remains of Shanidar Z were identified as a female in her mid-40s or possibly older, and she stood at about five feet tall. A facial reconstruction was also completed from skull fragments.\n\nDiets discovered\nLand snails were excavated and discovered in significant amounts and thought to be part of the Shanidar diet. It is unclear whether this diet was caused from cultural change or a change in the environment that lead to changes in previous foods as seen in the analysis of size decrease in goats. However, there are other lineages from Africa that share this diet and was culturally motivated which may indicate that the Neanderthals in the Shanidar cave may have possibly changed their diet for cultural reasons. In Layer B, dating back to approximately 12,000 years ago, Ralph S. Solecki found numerous snail shells which may indicate the Shanidar maintained this diet for some time.\n\nSee also\nList of fossil sites\nList of human evolution fossils\nList of Neanderthal fossils\nNeanderthals in Southwest Asia\nPaleopathology\n\nExternal links\nShanidar Cave video\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Shanidar_Cave.webm\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\nAgelarakis A., \"Proto Neolithic Human Skeletal Remains in the Zawi-Chemi Layer in Shanidar Cave\",  Sumer XL:1-2, pp. 7–16, (1987–88)\nAgelarakis, Anagnostis (1989).

          "content": "كهف شاندر هو كهف قديم من عصور ما قبل التاريخ في محافظه اربيل باقليم كردستان العراق بشمال العراق. وجد في الكهف بقايا عشرٍ من النياندرتال يرجع تاريخهم الى 65-35 الف عام. يحتوي الكهف ايضًا على مقبرتين تعودان الى العصر الحجري الحديث الخزفي السابق، يرجع تاريخ احداها الى 10,600 سنه ويحتوي على 35 فردًا.\nيُعتبر شاندر 1 الاكثر شهره من النياندرتال المكتشف، الذي نجى من العديد من الاصابات خلال حياته، وربما يرجع ذلك الى دفاع اعضاء قبيلته عنه، وشاندر 4، الذي يرقد جسده بجانب زهره والتي يمكن تفسيرها كدليل على ممارسه النياندرتال لطقوس الدفن او ربما تكون مجرد تلوث حيواني.\n\nبقايا النياندرتال\nوجدت الهياكل العشر من نياندرتال في الموقع خلال طبقه موستيريه كانت تحتوي على مئات الادوات الحجريه منها رماح ومكشطه جانبيه وعظام حيوانات كالماعز البري والسلحفاه مهمازيه الورك.\nاول تسعه من النياندرتال المكتشف (شاندر 1-9) كشف عنهم رالف سوليكي وفريق من جامعه كولومبيا بين 1957 و1961. حُمل هيكل شاندر 3 في مؤسسه سميثسونيان. وحُفظ الاخرون (شاندر 1 و2 و4-8) في العراق وربما فقدوا خلال غزو العراق عام 2003، الا ان بعض القوالب لاتزال موجوده في سميثسونيان. في عام 2006، اكتشفت مليندا زيدير ساقًا بينما كانت تبوِّب تشكيله العظام الحيوانيه من الموقع في سميثسونيان، كانت تلك الساق وعظام القدم تعود الى النياندرتال العاشر والمعروف حاليًا بـ«شاندر 10».\n\nشاندر 1\nشاندر 1 هو نياندرتال ذكر بدائي معروف باسم «ناندي» كما اطلق عليه مستكشفوه. كان عمره يتراوح بين 40 الى 50 عامًا، وهو مُسن بالنسبه الى النياندرتال، بما يعادل 80 عامًا اليوم، واظهر العديد من علامات التشوه. كان واحدًا من اربع هياكل كامله من الكهف اظهرت عاهات سببتها الاصابات الجسديه. وفي حالته كانت تلك الاصابات معيقه للحياه لدرجه انها جعلت حياته اليوميه مؤلمه.\nعانى شاندر 1 في فتره ما في حياته من الضرب العنيف على الجانب الايسر من الوجه، مما تسبب في اصابه كسريه في محجر العين الايسر وادى الى عمى كامل او جزئي لعينه اليسرى. اظهر التحليل ان شاندر 1 عانى من صمم عميق، لان مجرى الاذن اليسرى كان مسدودًا جزئيًّا واذنه اليمنى كانت مسدوده بالعرن. كما انه كان يعاني من اضرارًا في ذراعه اليمنى حيث انكسرت مرات عديده وعاودت الالتئام، ولكن ذلك تسبب في النهايه في فصل اسفل الذراع واليد. يُعتقد ان ذلك بسبب خلل وراثيّ او من مرض في الطفوله او بسبب البتر في فتره متاخره في الحياه. التئم الجرح ولكن الاصابه ربما تسببت في شلل على الجانب الايمن، مما ادى الى تشوهات في ساقيه وقدميه ادت الى ان يمشي بعرج مؤلم.\nاكتُسبت كل تلك الاصابات قبل الوفاه بفتره طويله، نظرًا لما يظهر من التئام واسع، ويُستخدم ذلك للاستدلال على ان النياندرتال اعتنوا بالمرضى والمسنين، مما يظهر انتشار التعاون الاجتماعي بينهم.\n\nشاندر 2\nكان شاندر 2 لذكر بالغ، مات في حادثه وقوع الصخور في الكهف، مما تسبب في كسر جمجمته وعظامه. يوجد دليل على ان شاندر 2 قد تلقى جنازه وداع بعد وفاته، حيث وجدت حزمه من الاحجار بها بعض الاحجار المصنوعه المدببه فوق قبره. كما كان هناك اشعالًا للنار في مكان الدفن.\n\nشاندر 3\nكان شاندر 3 ذكر نياندرتال عمره بين 40 و50 عامًا، وجد في نفس مقبره شاندر 1 وشاندر 2. تقترح الاصابه الموجوده على ضلعه الايسر التاسع انه مات نتيجه طعنه باداه حاده في الصدر. يشير نمو العظام حول الجرح ان شاندر عاش بعد الطعنه على الاقل لمده 3 اسابيع مع وجود الاداه الحاده في صدره. تستبعد تلك الطعنه محاوله ايذاء النفس، وتقترح انه تعرض لحادثه او الى طعن عمدي على يد فرد اخر. تقترح الابحاث الاخيره ان هذه الاصابه حدثت بسبب الطعن برمح واسع المدى. ربما يُعتبر ذلك من الامثله الاولى على العراك الثنائي في الحفريات البشريه وهو المثال الوحيد بين النياندرتال. ان وجود الانسان الحديث الاول، والذي كان مسلحًا بالاسلحه القاذفه، في غرب اسيا في نفس الحقبه الزمنيه، يقترح قيام الصراع بينهما. عانى شاندر 3 من الداء المفصلي التنكسي في قدمه نتيجه كسر او تمزق، مما ادى الى تحديد حركته والم في المفصل. يُعرض الهيكل في صاله الاصول الانسانيه في المتحف الوطني للتاريخ الطبيعي في واشنطن.\n\nشاندر 4 (المقبره المزهره)\nاكتُشف هيكل شاندر 4، لذكر بالغ عمره بين 30 و45 عامًا، في سوليكي عام 1960، موضوعًا على جانبه الايسر في وضع جنيني جزئي.\nاعتُقد للعديد من السنوات ان شاندر 4 يوفر دليلًا على انتشار طقوس الدفن بين النياندرتال. جُمعت عينات التربه المحيطه بالجثمان وحُللت حبوب اللقاح في محاوله لاعاده بناء المناخ القديم والتاريخ الخضري للموقع، وحُللت جميعها بعد 8 سنوات من الاكتشاف. في عينتين من التربه بالتحديد، اكتشف ارليت لوري غورهان كُتلًا من حبوب اللقاح علاوه على حبوب اللقاح المكتشفه في الموقع، مما يقترح وجود النباتات المزهره (او على الاقل الرؤوس) وانها كانت جزءً من بقايا القبر. كما تقترح دراسه اجريت على انواع الزهور انها كانت مختاره لاجل خصائص دوائيه محدده. وجد في عينات فحص حبوب اللقاح ادله على وجود النباتات التاليه: قيصوم الفي الاوراق وقنطريون صيفي ونوع من زهره الشيخ والخطميه، وجميعها معروف بالقدرات العلاجيه حيث تُستخدم كمدرات للبول ومحفزات وماده قابضه علاوه على خواصها المضاده للالتهاب. يدعم ذلك اقتراحًا؛ ان هذا الفرد كان يقوم بدور الطبيب في جماعته وانه اتسم بالقدرات الشامانيه.\nتقترح الاعمال الحديثه ان حبوب اللقاح دخلت التربه بفعل تاثير الحيوانات، حيث وجدت نماذج لقوارض تشبه حيوان الجربوع يُعرف بالجرذ الفارسي. كان الجرذ معروفًا بتخزين كميه كبيره من البذور والازهار في الجحور، استُخدمت تلك الحجه بالاضافه الى حجه الافتقار الى العلاج الطقوسي لبقيه الهياكل العظميه في الكهف لاقتراح ان شاندر 4 دُفن بطريقه طبيعيه وليست طقوسيه الاصل. صرَّح بول ب. بيتيت ان «الوضع العمدي للزهور على القبر دُحض الان تمامًا» مشددًا على ان «الفحص الحديث للبقايا الحيوانيه من الطبقات التي انتزع منها القبر تقترح ان حبوب اللقاح كانت موضوعه بفعل الجرذ الفارسي، وهو امر شائع في البقايا الحيوانيه مع شاندر، ويمكننا ملاحظه نشاط الجحور اليوم». بالرغم من استنتاجاته عن عدم الوضع العمدي للازهار، يستنتج بيتيت ان دفن شاندر، لانه حدث منذ زمن بعيد للغايه، يمثل ممارسات جنائزيه لنياندرتال.\n\nموقعه\nيوجد هذا الكهف على جانب جبل برادوست ضمن جبال زاكروس ضمن اقليم كردستان بشمال العراق وقد تمّ التنقيب عن الكهف بين عامي 1957-1961 من قبل رالف سوليكي وفريقه من جامعه كولومبيا واثمر عملهم عن الهياكل العظميه النياندرتاليه البالغه الاولى في العراق العائده الى 80,000 سنه قبل الميلاد.\nنتج التنقيب في هذه المنطقه عن تسع هياكل عظميه نياندرتاليه لاعمار مختلفه وفي حالات مختلفه من الحفظ والكمال وحُفظت وصنفت حسب الارقام\nمن شاندر1 - شاندر 9.\nالفرد العاشر اُكتُشِفَ مؤخراً وقد كان هذا النياندرتال العاشر مدفوناً وفق مراسم جنائزيه.\nهيكل عظمي واحد مع قوالب لبقيه الهياكل هي كل ما تبقى في المعهد من النتائج حيث ان الهياكل العظميه الاخرى تشتت وتفرقت في العراق.\n\nمحتوياته\nفي كهف شاندر عُثر على دفنه مهمه وملفته للنظر، اشتملت على عظام حيوانيه وجماجم لحوالي 15 من الماعز، وعظام وريش نسور

          "content": "Dur-Kurigalzu (modern `Aqar-Qūf عَقَرْقُوف in Baghdad Governorate, Iraq) was a city in southern Mesopotamia, near the confluence of the Tigris and Diyala rivers, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) west of the center of Baghdad. It was founded by a Kassite king of Babylon, Kurigalzu I (died c. 1375 BC) and was abandoned after the fall of the Kassite dynasty (c. 1155 BC). The city was of such importance that it appeared on toponym lists in the funerary temple of the Egyptian pharaoh, Amenophis III (c. 1351 BC) at Kom el-Hettan\".  The prefix Dur is an Akkadian term meaning \"fortress of\", while the Kassite royal name Kurigalzu is believed to have meant \"shepherd of the Kassites\". The tradition of naming new towns Dur dates back to the Old Babylonian period with an example being  Dūr-Ammī-ditāna. The city contained a ziggurat and temples dedicated to Mesopotamian gods, as well as a royal palace which covered 420,000 square meters.\nThe ziggurat at Aqar Quf, standing to a height of about 52 metres (171 ft), has been a very visible ancient monument for centuries. For camel caravans and modern road traffic, the ziggurat has served as a signal of the near approach to Baghdad. Because of Aqar Quf's easy accessibility and close proximity to the city of Baghdad, it has been one of Iraq's most visited and best-known sites. The ziggurat was often confused with the Tower of Babel by Western visitors to the area from the 17th century onwards.\n\nHistory\nThe town of Dur Kurigalzu was founded by the Kassite King Kurigalzu I in the early 14th century BC and is situated along an east–west-trending limestone ridge between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. Until the last century, the adjacent Aqar Quf depression would have been inundated with flood water part of the year. This site had access to fresh water from the Euphrates by means of the Isa Canal, known as the Patti-Enlil Canal in ancient times. The city functioned as the capital of Babylonia during the reign of Kurigalzu, and either as the capital or at least an important city during the period after. It was occupied continuously until the fall of the Kassite Dynasty in the 12th century BC when it was largely abandoned. The temple area, at least, was known to be active in the 7th century BC and in the Neo-Babylonian period. Up until recently (mostly between the 9th and 14th centuries AD), there have been smaller occupations at parts of Aqar Quf, with areas of the site being used for burials and for Arab settlement. It has been suggested that in earlier times the site was named Esâ.\n\nZiggurat\nThe Ziggurat of Dur-Kurigalzu, built in the early 14th century BC by Kurigalzu I, is located in the city's western area and is devoted to the chief Babylonian God Enlil, who Sumerians believed to govern over wind, air, earth, and storm.\nThe ziggurat's base measures 69m x 67m and it was constructed of large, well-tempered liben with many stamped baked bricks incorporated into the structure, bearing the name of Kurigalzu and his dedication of the temple E-U-GAL to Enlil. Facing the front, the Ziggurat can be approached from three main staircases leading up to the first level. Standing upright on the level withholds a terraced compound, built by layers of receding levels. At its core, there are consistent sun-dried square bricks with reed mats placed in every seven layers of brick to help hold the structure altogether. An axial flight of steps was discovered running outwards from the center of the side of the ziggurat towards the temple-complex and was built of solid kiln-baked brick set in bitumen.\n\nArchaeology\nIn Kassite times the area was defined by a wall that enclosed about 425 hectares (1,050 acres). The wall, originally built by Kurigalzu I, was later rebuilt by Kurigalzu II (c. 1332—1308 BC). The site has several defined areas, Mound A (100 meters south of the ziggurat), Tell Ahmar, Tell Abu Shijar, Tell al-Abyadh, and a private housing area. The main elements, ziggurat, palaces, etc. are all within the city wall. The currently known structures of the site consist of nine temples (T1 to T9), with T1 being the ziggurat and associated temple to Enlil, three palaces (P1 to T3), and five housing areas (H1 to H5)\nThe site was visited by Bengt Bengtsson Oxenstierna in 1616. Agar Quf first appeared on a modern map by Edward Ives in 1773. The site was then described by Claudius James Rich in 1811. Aqar Quf (referred to then as Akerkuf, Agger Koof, or Akar-kuf) was visited and examined in 1837 by Francis Rawdon Chesney. The name of Dur-Kurigalzu was identified by Henry Rawlinson in the mid-19th century.\n\nExcavations were conducted from 1942 through 1945, by Taha Baqir and Seton Lloyd in a joint excavation by the Iraqi Directorate-General of Antiquities and the British School of Archaeology in Iraq. Over 100 cuneiform tablets of the Kassite period were recovered, now in the Iraq Museum. Some were date-able to the reigns of Burna-Buriash II and Kashtiliash IV. They also showed that two of the palaces were named the Palace of the Mountain Sheep and the Palace of the Stag. A kudurru (IM 49991) dated to year five of Kassite ruler Nazi-Maruttash was also found. During the excavation, 5 fragments of a larger-than-life-size statue were discovered. They contain the longest yet found Kassite Sumerian inscriptions.\nA baked brick pavement (T5) around two kilometers northwest of Tell al-Abyadh was found to be covered with hundreds of broken terracotta figurines dedicated to the god Gula. Bricks found in situ were dated to the reign of Kassite ruler Nazi-Maruttash. The excavations included the ziggurat, three temples, and part of the palace of Dur-Kurigalzu II.\n\nIn the early 1960s and from 1968 to 1975 the Iraqi Directorate-General of Antiquities continued to do some excavation around the ziggurat as part of a restoration project under Saddam Hussein The three excavated areas are the mound of Aqar Quf (including the ziggurat and large temple), a public building (approximately 100 metres (330 ft) to the west), and Tell al-Abyadh where a large palace was partially uncovered (about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) to the south-west). Several burned cuneiform tables dated to the reign of Marduk-apla-iddina I were found there. As part of a temple restoration a pottery jar was found containing 220 Islamic silver dirhem coins from the Ilkhanid period.\nExcavations continued between 1977 and 1980, led by Suphi Anwar Rashid and Amire al-Khayyat, in the temple area. Paving and wall bricks dedicated to Enlil and Ninlil were found as well as a Kassite double jar burial, an inscribed eyestone for Enlil dedicated by Kurigalzu, and two female figurines in ivory.\nAnother area within Dur-Kurigalzu, Tell Abu Shijar, was excavated by Iraqi archaeologists in 1992, 1993, and 2001 finding mainly late Kassite and lesser Parthian/Sassanian remains. Painted plaster wall fragments, similar to those found at Tell al-Abyadh, were recovered as well as a worn cylinder seal and thirteen cuneiform clay tablets. The tablets were unread (and may be lost) but 3 were noted to have dates of the Kassite king Nazi-Maruttash (1307—1282 BC). The site lies 1 kilometer west of the ziggurat and 500 meters southwest of Tell al-Abyadh being about 6 meters in height with only the central 120-meter by 150-meter mound undisturbed by modern activity.\nIn the late-1960s an Italian team conducted a photogrammatic survey of the ziggurat.\n\nWall paintings at Tell al-Abyadh\nSome of the most significant finds of Kassite period artwork are found in the main palatial complex (P1) and its surrounding complexes (located at Tell al-Abyadh) of Dur-Kurigalzu about 1000 meters northwest of the main ziggurat. The recurring motifs of the artwork found on all four levels of the palatial complex are representational and contain human processional scenes and clusters of fruit; there are also geometric designs that contain parallel bands, chevrons, and rosettes. The processional scenes date to the time of the last Kassite king Marduk-apla-iddina I. The representational motif of human figures is also some of the only surviving instances of human representation in artwork from the Kassite period and gives an indication of the artistic technique utilized at the time. The majority of large, upright wall paintings can be found in the internal rooms of the palace that would have functioned as reception or public rooms. The highest concentration of this wall painting type can be found in Unit H sector on Level II named also 'PaintedPalace', dating to the reign of Kaštiliaš IV.\nAnother wall painting type is also found along recesses of the courtyards and between rooms and contains the same motifs of floral and geometric designs and processional scenes that Yoko Tomabechi states function to 'brighten the doorways and the inner rooms'. The colours utilised in these paintings are 'red, cobalt-blue, dark-blue, yellow, white and black'. Much of the palatial complex and its artwork inside remain unexcavated and need further exploration. In January 2025 the site of Aqar Quf has been included in the Tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Convention.\n\nTemples\nAt the base of the ziggurat steps, is a pavement that leads to one of the four excavated temples, E-U-GAL. This would also continue to lead into a court and several smaller rooms adjoining it. The other three temples are E-GASAN-AN-TA-GAL, E-SAG-DINGIR-RI-E-NE, and E-SAG-DINGIR-E-NE. King Kurigalzu appears to have built all these temples under great patronage. The entire complex mostly has liben walls that are thickly covered with plaster and may bear traces of fire, which are thought to reflect attempts in destroying the site in the past.\n\nE-U-GAL\nE-U-GAL, which is likely to mean \"The House of the Great Lord,\" is believed to be the most important temple of Dur Kurigalzu. This name could also refer to the entire temple complex or the entire site as the text was engraved into bricks in all three temples and in the ziggurat.\n\nE-GASAN-AN-TA-GAL\nThe name of the temple is a combination of \"The House of the Lady\" and words meaning \"high\", \"firm\", or \"great\". Inside this temple is a small staircase that leads up to an altar, subsidiary courts, and a room that appears to be the kitchen where a raised rectangular compartment was excavated and assumed to be an oven.\n\nTower\nBetween E-GASAN-AN-TA-GAL and E-U-GAL is a massive ruin, excavated to be 17 meters tall, that could be the foundation of a tower that was weathered away by floods. This structure was also made with liben and faced with baked bricks.\n\nCurrent status\nFor 16 seasons in the 1960s and 1970s the Iraqi government did conservation and restoration work at the site. Unfortunately the modern restoration work resulted in significant damage to the original construction it overlaid as it did at Babylon. Aqar Quf is currently suffering environmental damage and urban encroachment. Natural factors like rain and standing groundwater have contributed to the erosion of the ziggurat and damage to the ruins, especially along the southwest side. As a result of this damage, the ziggurat is in danger of further deterioration as well as collapse if preventive measures are not taken. The suburbs and industrial areas of Baghdad also continue developing near the site. Currently, there is an encroachment of modern construction along some stretches of the enclosure wall. There is also agricultural encroachment along the enclosure wall, especially on the southwest side. Iraqi Army maneuvers, involving trenches, did some damage to the site in the 1980s.\nThe ziggurat suffered damage as a result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq when the site was abandoned and looted during the security breakdown and chaos that followed the U.S. military's overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Little is left of the modern administration building, museum, event stage, and restaurant that once served the picnickers and students who visited the site before the war. Local government officials and the U.S. military charged with security in the area have been working to create a renovation plan. Since mid-2008, local officials have drafted plans to rebuild the historic site, yet to be implemented.\nAn Iraqi-Italian Archaeological Expedition by the University of Bologna and the SBAH, under the direction of prof. Nicolò Marchetti, has been working at the site of Aqar Quf since the Fall of 2022. The systematic survey of the site has been completed and, since the Fall of 2024, systematic excavations have also begun in the palace and temple areas. A new conservation project \"ArTourBagh\" funded by AICS and coordinated by Marchetti started in the Spring of 2025 with the aim of protecting and enhancing the mudbrick remains at the site, while promoting the touristic and social development in the area.\n\nTell Basmaya\nThe site of Tell Basmaya lies about seven kilometers southeast of modern Baghdad at the Tigris-Diyala river junction and just to the northeast of ancient Dur-Kurigalzu. It covers an area of about 4 hectares and consists of eight mounds (ranging in height from 1 to 4.5 meters). All of the mounds have now been destroyed by modern development. It was first identified in a 1957-1958 regional survey by Robert Adams (site #562). It was worked for two seasons from 2013 to 2014 by the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, led by Taha K. Abod, in a program of rescue archaeology before the area was developed. Excavation occurred at four (5, 6, 7, 8) of the mounds only two of which (6 and 7) showed signs of occupation. On mound seven (0.96 hectares in area, 4 meters in height) eight sizable (five with 5 rooms, three with 13 rooms, one with 16 rooms) buildings were excavated. Ten fragmentary cuneiform tablets were found in those buildings with two tablets bearing year names (14th and 17th) of Kassite ruler Kadashman-Turgu (c. 1281–1264 BC) along with five cylinder seals and one sealing. One seal, of fossilized coral, contains the inscription \"Marduk, have mercy on him\". Small finds included metal daggers and chisels and a number of faience objects, including a face mask and three chariot fittings. Forty-four intramural and extramural graves were found including a brick tomb and a vaulted tomb. Some late Sassanian and early Arabic period remains were found including many Aramaic incantation bowls.\n\nGallery\nThe following images represent the status of Aqar-Quf and its architectural remains as of December 29, 2021.\n\nSee also\nCities of the ancient Near East\nChronology of the ancient Near East\nKassite deities\nKudurru\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nal-BakRī, m.d., \"The discovery of Julairid coins at ‘Aqar-qūf\", Al-Maskūkat 3, pp. 77-80, 1972 (in arabic)\nAl-Hadithi, A., \"Archaeological excavations at Tell Abu Shijar ('Aqar Qūf).

They contain the longest yet found Kassite Sumerian inscriptions.\nA baked brick pavement (T5) around two kilometers northwest of Tell al-Abyadh was found to be covered with hundreds of broken terracotta figurines dedicated to the god Gula. Bricks found in situ were dated to the reign of Kassite ruler Nazi-Maruttash. The excavations included the ziggurat, three temples, and part of the palace of Dur-Kurigalzu II.\n\nIn the early 1960s and from 1968 to 1975 the Iraqi Directorate-General of Antiquities continued to do some excavation around the ziggurat as part of a restoration project under Saddam Hussein The three excavated areas are the mound of Aqar Quf (including the ziggurat and large temple), a public building (approximately 100 metres (330 ft) to the west), and Tell al-Abyadh where a large palace was partially uncovered (about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) to the south-west). Several burned cuneiform tables dated to the reign of Marduk-apla-iddina I were found there. As part of a temple restoration a pottery jar was found containing 220 Islamic silver dirhem coins from the Ilkhanid period.\nExcavations continued between 1977 and 1980, led by Suphi Anwar Rashid and Amire al-Khayyat, in the temple area. Paving and wall bricks dedicated to Enlil and Ninlil were found as well as a Kassite double jar burial, an inscribed eyestone for Enlil dedicated by Kurigalzu, and two female figurines in ivory.\nAnother area within Dur-Kurigalzu, Tell Abu Shijar, was excavated by Iraqi archaeologists in 1992, 1993, and 2001 finding mainly late Kassite and lesser Parthian/Sassanian remains. Painted plaster wall fragments, similar to those found at Tell al-Abyadh, were recovered as well as a worn cylinder seal and thirteen cuneiform clay tablets. The tablets were unread (and may be lost) but 3 were noted to have dates of the Kassite king Nazi-Maruttash (1307—1282 BC). The site lies 1 kilometer west of the ziggurat and 500 meters southwest of Tell al-Abyadh being about 6 meters in height with only the central 120-meter by 150-meter mound undisturbed by modern activity.\nIn the late-1960s an Italian team conducted a photogrammatic survey of the ziggurat.\n\nWall paintings at Tell al-Abyadh\nSome of the most significant finds of Kassite period artwork are found in the main palatial complex (P1) and its surrounding complexes (located at Tell al-Abyadh) of Dur-Kurigalzu about 1000 meters northwest of the main ziggurat. The recurring motifs of the artwork found on all four levels of the palatial complex are representational and contain human processional scenes and clusters of fruit; there are also geometric designs that contain parallel bands, chevrons, and rosettes. The processional scenes date to the time of the last Kassite king Marduk-apla-iddina I. The representational motif of human figures is also some of the only surviving instances of human representation in artwork from the Kassite period and gives an indication of the artistic technique utilized at the time. The majority of large, upright wall paintings can be found in the internal rooms of the palace that would have functioned as reception or public rooms. The highest concentration of this wall painting type can be found in Unit H sector on Level II named also 'PaintedPalace', dating to the reign of Kaštiliaš IV.\nAnother wall painting type is also found along recesses of the courtyards and between rooms and contains the same motifs of floral and geometric designs and processional scenes that Yoko Tomabechi states function to 'brighten the doorways and the inner rooms'. The colours utilised in these paintings are 'red, cobalt-blue, dark-blue, yellow, white and black'. Much of the palatial complex and its artwork inside remain unexcavated and need further exploration. In January 2025 the site of Aqar Quf has been included in the Tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Convention.\n\nTemples\nAt the base of the ziggurat steps, is a pavement that leads to one of the four excavated temples, E-U-GAL. This would also continue to lead into a court and several smaller rooms adjoining it. The other three temples are E-GASAN-AN-TA-GAL, E-SAG-DINGIR-RI-E-NE, and E-SAG-DINGIR-E-NE. King Kurigalzu appears to have built all these temples under great patronage. The entire complex mostly has liben walls that are thickly covered with plaster and may bear traces of fire, which are thought to reflect attempts in destroying the site in the past.\n\nE-U-GAL\nE-U-GAL, which is likely to mean \"The House of the Great Lord,\" is believed to be the most important temple of Dur Kurigalzu. This name could also refer to the entire temple complex or the entire site as the text was engraved into bricks in all three temples and in the ziggurat.\n\nE-GASAN-AN-TA-GAL\nThe name of the temple is a combination of \"The House of the Lady\" and words meaning \"high\", \"firm\", or \"great\". Inside this temple is a small staircase that leads up to an altar, subsidiary courts, and a room that appears to be the kitchen where a raised rectangular compartment was excavated and assumed to be an oven.\n\nTower\nBetween E-GASAN-AN-TA-GAL and E-U-GAL is a massive ruin, excavated to be 17 meters tall, that could be the foundation of a tower that was weathered away by floods. This structure was also made with liben and faced with baked bricks.\n\nCurrent status\nFor 16 seasons in the 1960s and 1970s the Iraqi government did conservation and restoration work at the site. Unfortunately the modern restoration work resulted in significant damage to the original construction it overlaid as it did at Babylon. Aqar Quf is currently suffering environmental damage and urban encroachment. Natural factors like rain and standing groundwater have contributed to the erosion of the ziggurat and damage to the ruins, especially along the southwest side. As a result of this damage, the ziggurat is in danger of further deterioration as well as collapse if preventive measures are not taken. The suburbs and industrial areas of Baghdad also continue developing near the site. Currently, there is an encroachment of modern construction along some stretches of the enclosure wall. There is also agricultural encroachment along the enclosure wall, especially on the southwest side. Iraqi Army maneuvers, involving trenches, did some damage to the site in the 1980s.\nThe ziggurat suffered damage as a result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq when the site was abandoned and looted during the security breakdown and chaos that followed the U.S. military's overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Little is left of the modern administration building, museum, event stage, and restaurant that once served the picnickers and students who visited the site before the war. Local government officials and the U.S. military charged with security in the area have been working to create a renovation plan. Since mid-2008, local officials have drafted plans to rebuild the historic site, yet to be implemented.\nAn Iraqi-Italian Archaeological Expedition by the University of Bologna and the SBAH, under the direction of prof. Nicolò Marchetti, has been working at the site of Aqar Quf since the Fall of 2022. The systematic survey of the site has been completed and, since the Fall of 2024, systematic excavations have also begun in the palace and temple areas. A new conservation project \"ArTourBagh\" funded by AICS and coordinated by Marchetti started in the Spring of 2025 with the aim of protecting and enhancing the mudbrick remains at the site, while promoting the touristic and social development in the area.\n\nTell Basmaya\nThe site of Tell Basmaya lies about seven kilometers southeast of modern Baghdad at the Tigris-Diyala river junction and just to the northeast of ancient Dur-Kurigalzu. It covers an area of about 4 hectares and consists of eight mounds (ranging in height from 1 to 4.5 meters). All of the mounds have now been destroyed by modern development. It was first identified in a 1957-1958 regional survey by Robert Adams (site #562). It was worked for two seasons from 2013 to 2014 by the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, led by Taha K. Abod, in a program of rescue archaeology before the area was developed. Excavation occurred at four (5, 6, 7, 8) of the mounds only two of which (6 and 7) showed signs of occupation. On mound seven (0.96 hectares in area, 4 meters in height) eight sizable (five with 5 rooms, three with 13 rooms, one with 16 rooms) buildings were excavated. Ten fragmentary cuneiform tablets were found in those buildings with two tablets bearing year names (14th and 17th) of Kassite ruler Kadashman-Turgu (c. 1281–1264 BC) along with five cylinder seals and one sealing. One seal, of fossilized coral, contains the inscription \"Marduk, have mercy on him\". Small finds included metal daggers and chisels and a number of faience objects, including a face mask and three chariot fittings. Forty-four intramural and extramural graves were found including a brick tomb and a vaulted tomb. Some late Sassanian and early Arabic period remains were found including many Aramaic incantation bowls.\n\nGallery\nThe following images represent the status of Aqar-Quf and its architectural remains as of December 29, 2021.\n\nSee also\nCities of the ancient Near East\nChronology of the ancient Near East\nKassite deities\nKudurru\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nal-BakRī, m.d., \"The discovery of Julairid coins at ‘Aqar-qūf\", Al-Maskūkat 3, pp. 77-80, 1972 (in arabic)\nAl-Hadithi, A., \"Archaeological excavations at Tell Abu Shijar ('Aqar Qūf).

          "summary": "Dur-Kurigalzu (modern `Aqar-Qūf عَقَرْقُوف in Baghdad Governorate, Iraq) was a city in southern Mesopotamia, near the confluence of the Tigris and Diyala rivers, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) west of the center of Baghdad. It was founded by a Kassite king of Babylon, Kurigalzu I (died c. 1375 BC) and was abandoned after the fall of the Kassite dynasty (c. 1155 BC). The city was of such importance that it appeared on toponym lists in the funerary temple of the Egyptian pharaoh, Amenophis III (c. 1351 BC) at Kom el-Hettan\".  The prefix Dur is an Akkadian term meaning \"fortress of\", while the Kassite royal name Kurigalzu is believed to have meant \"shepherd of the Kassites\". The tradition of naming new towns Dur dates back to the Old Babylonian period with an example being  Dūr-Ammī-ditāna. The city contained a ziggurat and temples dedicated to Mesopotamian gods, as well as a royal palace which covered 420,000 square meters.\nThe ziggurat at Aqar Quf, standing to a height of about 52 metres (171 ft), has been a very visible ancient monument for centuries. For camel caravans and modern road traffic, the ziggurat has served as a signal of the near approach to Baghdad. Because of Aqar Quf's easy accessibility and close proximity to the city of Baghdad, it has been one of Iraq's most visited and best-known sites. The ziggurat was often confused with the Tower of Babel by Western visitors to the area from the 17th century onwards.",

          "content": "زقوره عقرقوف وهي زقوره تَقع في العراق، قرب العاصمه بغداد، وكانت معلم احدى المُدن في جنوب بلاد وادي الرافدين بالقرب من التقاء نهري دِجله وديالى على بعد 30 كيلو متر (19 ميل) من غرب مركز بغداد، ولقد تاسست من قبل ملك الكيشين كوريغالزو الاول في القرن الرابع عشر قبل الميلاد، وكانت تُعتبر عاصمه الكيشين وانتهت اهميتها بعد سقوط سلاله الكيشين، وتحتوي الزقوره على المعابد المكرسه لالهه السومريين فضلاً عن القَصر الملكي، وليس من السهل الحفاظ عليها من اثار التقادم الزمني والاندثار، ويبلغ ارتفاع الزقوره نحو 170 قدم (52 م).\n\nالتاريخ\nيعود تاريخ تاسيس الزقوره الى ملك الكيشين كوريغالزو الاول في اواخر القرن الخامس عشر واوائل القرن الرابع عشر قبل الميلاد، وتَقع الزقوره على طول تلال كلسه بين الشرق والغرب ونهر دجله والفرات، وفي القرن الماضي غمرت مياه الفيضان زقوره عقرقوف وسبب الفيضان تحطيم بعض الاجزاء من الزقوره، ولعل مياه الفيضان قد كانت تفيد المدينه سابقا للدفاع والحمايه، كما كانت تسقى من نهر عيسى المشهور، الذي كان يسمى في العهود البابليه بـ (قنال انليل)، وكانت الزقوره عاصمه للبلاد في عهد كوريكالزو في العصور القديمه، وبعد سقوط سلاله الكيشين فقدت مكانتها واحتلت في القرن الثاني عشر قبل الميلاد وتركت وتخلى عنها الى حد كبير. واستمر الاستيطان والسكن في مدينه عقرقوف بعد سقوط الدوله الكيشيه على يد العيلاميين، حيث استوطنها الاراميين في عصر دوله بابل الحديثه ويعتقد انهم هم من اطلقو تسميه عقرقوف، واعادوا اعمار المدينه من جديد بعض تعرضها الى هجمات الاشوريين المتكرره، واستمر الاستيطان فيها حتى العصر العربي الاسلامي حيث استوطنها المسلمين من القرن الثالث وحتى القرن الثامن عشر وما زال الاستيطان موجوداً الى حد الان حيث ان منطقه ابو غريب قريبه على موقع زقوره وتقطن فيها الان عشائر عربيه عراقيه.\n\nفي زمن الكيشين كان يحيط الزقوره سور ضخم جداً يقدر بحوالي 225 هكتار (560 فداناً)،  والجوانب خلف السور من الضاحيه الشرقيه للزقوره كان يتواجد فيها هناك بحيره من الماء، ويتواجد العديد من التلال حول الزقوره، وتعتبر زقوره عقرقوف من المباني التراثيه والتاريخيه في المنطقه، والزقوره كانت مُكرسه للالهه الرئيسيه وهم «انليل» و«نينليل» و«نينورتا»، ولقد تاسست المعابد في الجنوب الشرقي من الزقوره وتَبين من خلال التنقيبات التي اجراها الباحثون الاثريون في بدايه عقد الاربعينيات من القرن العشرين ان الملك كوريكالزو الثالث هو مؤسس هذهِ المعابد والتي تتكون من ساحات كبيره يحيط بها عدد كبير من الحجرات والاورقه والممرات، واعتماداً على الادله الاثريه المكتشفه في هذا الموقع تبين ان هذه المعابد استعملت من قبل الادوار التي خلفت (الدور الكيشي) وهو العهد الاشوري والعهد البابلي الحديث (1000 ــ 500 ق.م)، ولقد شيد الملوك الكيشيين قصور المدينه المكتشفه في تل ابيض شمال غرب الزقوره وتدل الكتابات المسماريه التي عثر عليها في قصور المدينه باسم قصور مدينه كويكالزو وتعرض معالم معماريه من مرافق قصور الملوك المهمه وهي ثلاثه اقببه متوازيه الى جانبي كل منها عدد من المخازن المعقوده بهيئه جيوب نصف دائريه، وقاعده الزقوره مُربعه الشكل تقريباً ابعادها (69 × 67) وتتجه زواياها الى الجهات الاربع وتميل اوجهها الاربعه عن العامود الى الداخل بحوالي 9 سم لكل متر من الارتفاع، واوجه القاعده مُغلقه من الخارج بغلاف من الاجر تزينه وتحليه هندسه معماريه على شكل نظام الطلعات والدخلات في اوجهها الاربعه، وتوجد ثلاث سلالم سلم وسطي وسلمان جانبيان يتصلان بها وتؤدي الى سطح القاعده المُربعه التي شيدتها المديريه العامه للاثار العراقيه.\n\nالزقوره\nبُنيت زقوره عقرقوف في القرن الرابع عشر قبل الميلاد من قبل ملك الكيشين كوريغالزو الاول، وتحتوي الزقوره على مجموعه طبقات وتبدو الطبقات من البوري (حصير القصب) موضوعه في البناء بين كل 8 او 9 مسافات من اللبن تتخللها ثقوب مربعه كبيره تنفذ داخل الزقوره والهدف منها التخلص من الرطوبه والمياه التي تصيب الزقوره بين اونه واخرى.\nوكانت الزقوره مركزاً تجارياً لعده قرون، حيث كانت تمر بها قوافل الابل والتجاره على الطرق الحديثه، ويعتبر موقع الزقوره احد المواقع المفضله للنزهه من قبل العوائل البغداديه خصوصا في العطل ويوم الجمعه، وقد بُني مبنى مَتحف صغير بقربها في عام 1960 وانشئ لتقديم الخدمات لزوار الموقع وهو الان مُهمل.\nبسبب قرب موقع زقوره عقرقوف الى العاصمه بغداد، فقد مكنها ذلك من ان تصبح من الاماكن والمواقع العراقيه التراثيه الاكثر شهره وزياره.\n\nالدراسه والبحث\nتم اعطاء وَصف للموقع لاول مره من قبل كلوديس جيمس ريش في عام 1811، ولقد تم زياره زقوره عقرقوف في عام 1837 من قبل فرانسيس راودون تشيسيني، وتعرف على اسم زقوره عقرقوف التي كتب عنها هنري رولينسون في منتصف القرن التاسع عشر ميلادي.\n\nاجريت عمليات حَفر وتنقيب في الاعوام 1942-1945 من قبل الباحث العراقي طه باقر مع الباحث الانكليزي سيتون لويد وكان العمل مُشترك بين المديريه العامه للاثار العراقيه والمدرسه البريطانيه للاثار في العراق. وكُشف عن اكثر من 100 لوح مكتوب بالخط المسماري في فتره عهد الكيشين، والالواح موجوده حاليا في قاعات المتحف الوطني العراقي.\nوشملت الحفريات والتنقيب، مبنى الزقوره والمعابد الثلاث وجزء من قصر زقوره عقرقوف الثانيه، وواصلت المديريه العامه للاثار العراقيه القيام ببعض اعمال الحفر حول مبنى الزقوره كجزء من مشروع الترميم والصيانه في عهد الرئيس العراقي السابق صدام حسين، وفي عام 1970 اعيد بناءها في المرحله الدنيا من الهيكل، المناطق الثلاثه المجاوره الى زقوره عقرقوف (تتضمن الزقوره والمعابد) والمباني العامه (حوالي 100 متر الى الجنوب الغربي)، والتل الابيض كان قصر كبير جداً، وكانت الزقوره مكونه من طبقات من الحصير القصب التي كانت تمسك هيكل البناء لكي لا يَقع، وعُثر على العديد من الاعمال الرئيسيه المعروفه حالياً من فتره عهد الكيشين داخل قصر تل الابيض وموجود هناك في عقرقوف، ولقد تم حَفر واستكشاف تل ابو شجر من قبل علماء الاثار العراقيه ونشرت النتائج.\n\nالوضع الحالي\nتعاني زقوره عقرقوف حالياً من الاضرار البيئيه والزحف العمراني او التوسع العمراني وقد ادت عوامل طبيعيه مثل الامطار والمياه الجوفيه الى تاكل الزقوره ولحوق الاضرار بها، وخصوصاً على طول الجانب الجنوبي الغربي، ونتيجه لهذا الضرر فان الزقوره في خطر ومزيد من التدهور وكذلك الانهيار ما لم يَتخد اجراءات وتدابير وقائيه، وتستمر الضواحي والمناطق الصناعيه في بغداد على التطوير والتوسع بالقرب من الموقع، وايضاً يوجد التوسع الزراعي على الموقع، وفي عام 1980 كان يوجد مناورات الى الجيش العراقي مما سُبب في تضرر الزقوره.\nتضررت الزقوره من الغزو الامريكي للعراق وتعرضت للنهب والهمل خلال انهيار الامن وانعيام الفوضى التي اعقبت الاطاحه بالنظام العراقي الذي كان يراسهُ صدام حسين، وبقي القليل من مبنى حديث الاداره والمتحف والمطعم الذي خدم المتنزهين والطلاب الذين زارو الموقع قبل الحرب، في منتصف عام 2008 صاغ مسؤولون محليون خطط لاعاده بناء الموقع التاريخي، وفي عام 2013 قامت المديريه العامه للاثار العراقيه بعمليه صيانه زقوره عقرقوف وكانت عمليه التاهيل تاتي ضمن فعاليات مشروع بغداد عاصمه الثقافه العربيه في عام 2013.\n\nمعرض الصور\nانظر ايضًا\nزقوره اور\n\nالمصادر\nمراجع عربيه\n\nمراجع انكليزيه\n\n== قراءه مُتعمقه ==",

          "content": "Sippar (Sumerian: 𒌓𒄒𒉣𒆠, Zimbir) (also Sippir or Sippara) was an ancient Near Eastern Sumerian and later Babylonian city on the east bank of the Euphrates river. Its tell is located at the site of modern Tell Abu Habbah near Yusufiyah in Iraq's Baghdad Governorate, some 69 km (43 mi) north of Babylon and 30 km (19 mi) southwest of Baghdad. The city's ancient name, Sippar, could also refer to its sister city, Sippar-Amnanum (located at the modern site of Tell ed-Der); a more specific designation for the city here referred to as Sippar was Sippar-Yaḫrurum (Sippar-Jaḫrurum). The name comes from the Amorite Yaḫrurum tribe that lived in the area along with the Amorite Amnanum tribe. In Sippar was the site where the Babylonian Map of the World was found.\n\nHistory\nWhile pottery finds indicate that the site of Sippar was in use as early as the Uruk period, substantial occupation occurred only in the Early Dynastic and Akkadian Empire periods of the 3rd millennium BC, the Old Babylonian and Kassite periods of the 2nd millennium BC, and the Neo-Babylonian times of the 1st millennium BC. Lesser levels of use continued into the time of the Achaemenid, Seleucid and Parthian Empires.\n\nEarly Bronze Age\nDespite the fact that thousands of cuneiform clay tablets have been recovered at the site, relatively little is known about the history of Sippar. In the Sumerian king list a king of Sippar, En-men-dur-ana, is listed as one of the early pre-dynastic rulers of the region but has not yet turned up in the epigraphic records.\n\nAkkadian period\nSippar was the cult site of the sun god (Sumerian Utu, Akkadian Shamash), along with his consort Aya, and the home of his temple E-babbara (𒂍𒌓𒌓𒊏, means \"white house\") where the Cruciform Monument of Manishtushu was found. Mamu, the daughter of Shamash, also had a temple in Sippar as did the goddesses Nin-Isina, Ninḫegal, Ninkarrak, and Tašmētum.\nIn the later part of the 3rd millennium BC, a large coalition of city-states led by Iphur-Kis of Kish (Sumer) and Amar-Girid of Uruk, joined by Enlil-nizu of Nippur, and including the city-states of \"Kutha, TiWA, Sippar, Kazallu, Kiritab, [Api]ak   and GN\" as well as \"Amorite  [hi]ghlanders\" revolted against Akkadian Empire ruler Naram-Sin of Akkad. The rebellion was joined by the city of Borsippa, among others. The revolt was crushed.\n\nMiddle Bronze Age\nSippar was the production center of wool. It also produced some of the finest Old Babylonian cylinder seals.\n\nMiddle Bronze I\nIn Middle Bronze IB (c. 1900-1820 BC), the city-state of Babylon started to expand. Sippar eventually came within the Babylonian realm. Sumu-la-El of Babylon (r. 1878-1843 BC) conducted several military campaigns gaining control over Sippar. In his 29th year of reign, Sumulael reported building the city wall of Sippar. Sabium (r. 1842-1829 BC) did some religious activity dedicated to Utu/Shamash, Marduk in one of his year-names. Apil-Sin (r. 1828-1812 BC) did some activity in Sippar in his Year 14.\nBased on Shamash Temple records Sippar ruler Immerum is known to have been roughly contemporary with the rule of Sumu-la-El. He is suggested to have been ruling Sippar when Babylon took control based on a text sealed with oaths to both Immerum and Sumu-la-El. In another text detailing gifts for dignitaries Sumu-abum, first ruler of the First Babylonian Empire received the largest gift with Immerum and Sumu-la-El (2nd ruler of that empire) receiving smaller gifts. Four year names of Immerum are known including \"The year (in which) the temple of Inanna Immerum built\".\n\nMiddle Bronze II (c. 1820-1587 BC)\nSin-Muballit (r. 1811-1793 BC) controlled the city and a sealed clay envelope is known.\n\nSome years later Hammurabi of Babylon (r. 1792-1750 BC) reported laying the foundations of the city wall of Sippar in his 23rd year and worked on the wall again in his 43rd year. His successor in Babylon, Samsu-iluna (r. 1749-1712 BC) worked on Sippar's wall in his 1st year. The city walls, being typically made of mud bricks, required much attention. The Code of Hammurabi stele was probably erected at Sippar. Shamash was the god of justice, and he is depicted handing authority to the king in the image at the top of the stele.\nThe city flourished under Babylonian rule until the Sack of Babylon by Mursili I of Hatti around 1587 BC.\n\nLate Bronze Age\nKassite period\nThe city then came under the control of the Kassite dynasty.\n\nElamite period\nIn the final years of that dynasty the Elamite ruler Shutruk-Nakhunte (c. 1184 to 1155 BC) captured Sippar. Shutruk-Nakhunte carried back statues from the Shamash temple to Susa adding his own inscription to a stele of the Akkadian Empire ruler Naram-Sin:\n\n\"I am Shutruk-Nahhunte, son of Hallutush-Inshushinak, beloved servant of the god Inshushinak, king of Anshan and Susa, who has enlarged the kingdom, who takes care of the lands of Elam, the lord of the land of Elam. When the god Inshushinak gave me the order, I defeated Sippar. I took the stele of Naram-Sin and carried it off, bringing it to the land of Elam. For Inshushinak, my god, I set it as an offering.\"\n\nIron Age\nNeo-Babylonian period\nIn the succeeding Late Bronze Age collapse period, it was taken by the Neo-Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar I about 1120 BC. In the reign of Neo-Babylonian ruler Adad-apla-iddina (c. 1064–1043 BC) the Shamash cult center along with all the other temples in Sippar were destroyed by Suteans and cult symbol of Shamash was lost.\n\nNeo-Assyrian period\nIn the early 1st millennium BC, Sippar came under Neo-Assyrian control. After the final defeat of the Neo-Assyrians by the Neo-Babylonians at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC text report that a number of Egyptian and Assyrian prisoners were brought to Sippar as chattel. Records of Neo-Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II (605-562 BC) and Nabonidos (556-539 BC) record that they repaired the Shamash temple E-babbara.\n\nAchaemenid period\nAfter the Battle of Opis in September 539 BC Sippar surrendered to the Achaemenid Empire, followed soon after by the fall of the Neo-Babylonian empire.\n\nSpeculation\nXisuthros, the \"Chaldean Noah\" in Sumerian mythology, is said by Berossus to have buried the records of the antediluvian world here—possibly because the name of Sippar was supposed to be connected with sipru, \"a writing\". And according to Abydenus, Nebuchadnezzar II excavated a great reservoir in the neighbourhood.\nPliny (Natural History 6.30.123) mentions a sect of Chaldeans called the Hippareni. It is often assumed that this name refers to Sippar (especially because the other two schools mentioned seem to be named after cities as well: the Orcheni after Uruk, and the Borsippeni after Borsippa), but this is not universally accepted.\nSippar has been suggested as the location of the Biblical Sepharvaim in the Old Testament, which alludes to the two parts of the city in its dual form.\n\nArchaeology\nTell Abu Habba, measuring over 1 square kilometer was first excavated by Hormuzd Rassam (referring to the site as Aboo-Habba) between 1880 and 1881 for the British Museum in a dig that lasted 18 months. Rassam excavated only down to the Old Babylonian levels and was focused mainly on the Neo-Babylonian remains. Tens of thousands of tablets were recovered including the Tablet of Shamash in the Temple of Shamash/Utu. Most of the tablets were Neo-Babylonian. The temple had been mentioned as early as the 18th year of Samsu-iluna of Babylon, who reported restoring \"Ebabbar, the temple of Szamasz in Sippar\", along with the city's ziggurat.\nThe tablets, which ended up in the British Museum, are being studied to this day. As was often the case in the early days of archaeology, excavation records were not made, particularly find spots. This makes it difficult to tell which tablets came from Sippar-Amnanum as opposed to Sippar. Other tablets from Sippar were bought on the open market during that time and ended up at places like the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania. Since the site is relatively close to Baghdad, it was a popular target for illegal excavations.\nIn 1894, Sippar was worked briefly by Jean-Vincent Scheil. The tablets recovered, mainly Old Babylonian, went to the Istanbul Museum. In 1927 archaeologists Walter Andrae and Julius Jordan visited, and mapped, the site. In modern times, the site was worked, mainly soundings, by a Belgian team led by H. Gasche from 1972 to 1973. They determined that Sippar was protected by a wall, partially for flood protection, extending 1200 meters by 800 meters, cutting a trench across it. A tablet of Samsu-iluna was found showing the wall dated back to at least Old Babylonian period though ground water prevented deeper excavation.\n\nIraqi archaeologists from the College of Arts at the University of Baghdad, led by Walid al-Jadir with Farouk al-Rawi, have excavated at Tell Abu Habbah starting in 1978. Work began with a new site contour map and excavation in the Old Babylonian area in the north where two buildings were uncovered. About 100 Old Babylonian period cuneiform tablets were found. Subsequently, the team worked in an Old Babylonian residential area where terracotta plaques and figurines, and cuneiform tablets were found. The tablets were from the reign of Immerum, Buntahun-ila, and Samsu-iluna. Focus then shifted to the Shamash temple area. In the northeast, Old Babylonian part of the site, a 30 meter by 5 meter deep sounding was excavated. The sounding found 4 Old Babylonian levels, 2 Akkadian Empire levels, and 3 Early Dynastic levels ( with plano-convex mud brick construction). In 1986, while clearing spoil from the Rassam excavation in the E-Babbar temple, a room was discovered which Rassam had not noticed. It contained a library with about 400 cuneiform tablets, which had been stored in 10 ranks of 17cm by 30cm niches in 4 rows. The tablets included copies of earlier inscriptions dating back to the Akkadian Empire and contemporary texts as late as the reign of Cambyses II. Few of the tablets were published at the time due to conditions in Iraq. With conditions improving, they are now being published. After 2000, they were joined by the German Archaeological Institute. In total, the effort continued in 24 seasons until 2002. In the 24th season in 2002, 700 cuneiform\ntablets were found in one important building in the center of town. Most date to the\nreign of Ammi-Saduqa (c. 1646–1626 BC) a ruler of the First Dynasty of Babylon with \na few from Abi-Eshuh (c. 1711-1684 BC) and Ammi-Ditana (c. 1683-1647 BC).\n\nGallery\nList of rulers\nThe following list should not be considered complete:\n\nSee also\nList of cities of the ancient Near East\nCylinders of Nabonidus\nNadītu in Sippar\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\nF.

          "summary": "Sippar (Sumerian: 𒌓𒄒𒉣𒆠, Zimbir) (also Sippir or Sippara) was an ancient Near Eastern Sumerian and later Babylonian city on the east bank of the Euphrates river. Its tell is located at the site of modern Tell Abu Habbah near Yusufiyah in Iraq's Baghdad Governorate, some 69 km (43 mi) north of Babylon and 30 km (19 mi) southwest of Baghdad. The city's ancient name, Sippar, could also refer to its sister city, Sippar-Amnanum (located at the modern site of Tell ed-Der); a more specific designation for the city here referred to as Sippar was Sippar-Yaḫrurum (Sippar-Jaḫrurum). The name comes from the Amorite Yaḫrurum tribe that lived in the area along with the Amorite Amnanum tribe. In Sippar was the site where the Babylonian Map of the World was found.",

          "content": "Shuruppak (Sumerian: 𒋢𒆳𒊒𒆠 ŠuruppagKI, SU.KUR.RUki, \"the healing place\"), modern Tell Fara, was an ancient Sumerian city situated about 55 kilometres (35 mi) south of Nippur and 30 kilometers north of ancient Uruk on the banks of the Euphrates in Iraq's Al-Qādisiyyah Governorate. Shuruppak was dedicated to Ninlil, also called Sud, the goddess of grain and the air. The Early Dynastic IIIa period is also sometimes called the Fara period. Not to be confused with the Levantine archaeological site Tell el-Far'ah (South).\n\"Shuruppak\" is sometimes also the name of a king of the city, legendary survivor of the Flood, and supposed author of the Instructions of Shuruppak\".\n\nHistory\nJemdet Nasr period\nThe earliest excavated levels at Shuruppak date to the Jemdet Nasr period about 3000 BC. Several objects made of arsenical copper were found in Shuruppak/Fara dating to the Jemdet Nasr period (c. 2900 BC). Similar objects were also found at Tepe Gawra (levels XII-VIII).\n\nEarly Dynastic II\nThe city rose in importance and size, exceeding 40 hectares(0.4km2), during the Early Dynastic period.\nIn the Sumerian King List is a ruler, Ubara-Tutu, the last ruler \"before the flood\". In some versions he is followed by a son, Ziusudra. In later versions of the Epic of Gilgamesh, a man named Utnapishtim, son of Ubara-Tutu, is noted to be king of Shuruppak. This portion of Gilgamesh is thought to have been taken from another literary composition, the Myth of Atrahasis.\n\nEarly Dynastic III\nThe city expanded to its greatest extent at the end of the Early Dynastic III period (2600 BC to 2350 BC) when it covered about 100 hectares.\nCuneiform tablets from the Early Dynastic III period show a thriving, military oriented economy with links to cities throughout the region. It has been proposed that Fara was part of a \"hexapolis\" with Lagash, Nippur, Uruk, Adab, and Umma, possibly under the leadership of Kish. It has been proposed that in the Early Dynastic IIIa period Shuruppak had passed from the control of Kish to that of Uruk and was part of joint military operations against Kish (with Adab, Nippur, Lagaš, Umma) under the leadership of Uruk.\n\nAkkadian period\nIn the Akkadian Period (c. 2334–2154 BC), Shuruppak was ruled by a governor holding the title patesi. Like most cities on the Euphrates, it declined during the Akkadian Empire. A clay cone from the Akkadian Empire period found at Shurappak read \"Dada, governor of Suruppak: Hala-adda, gover[nor] of Suruppak, his son, laid the ... of the city gate of the goddess Sud\".\nGovernors: Dada; Hala-adda;\n\nUr III period\nDuring Ur III period (c. 2112-2004 BC), the city was ruled by a governors (ensi2) appointed by Ur. One is known to be Ur-nigar, son of Shulgi, first rulers of Ur III. One of the tablets found at the site is dated by a year name to the beginning of the reign of Shu-Sin, next to last ruler of Ur III. A few governors of Shurappak under the Ur III Empire are known from contemporary epigraphic remains, Ku-Nanna, Lugal-hedu, Ur-nigin-gar, and Ur-Ninkura. In much later literary compositions several purported rulers are mentioned.\n\nMiddle Bronze I\nIn the 2020s BC, the Ur III Empire was hit by a major drought. It is thought to have been abandoned shortly around 2000 BC.\nA Isin-Larsa cylinder seal and several pottery plaques which may date to early in the second millennium BC were found at the site. Surface finds are predominantly Early Dynastic. In the 2nd year of Enlil-bani (c. 1860–1837 BC), ruler of Isin, a sage of Nippur is recorded as leaving an herbal medicine at Shurappak.\n\nFlood Myth\nThe report of the 1930s excavation mentions a layer of flood deposits at the end of the Jemdet Nasr period at Shuruppak. Shuruppak in Mesopotamian legend is one of the \"antediluvian\" cities and the home of King Utnapishtim, who survives the flood by making a boat beforehand. Schmidt wrote that the flood story of the Bible,seems to be based on a very real event or a series of such, as suggested by the existence at Ur, at Kish, and now at Fara, of inundation deposits, which accumulated on top of human inhabitation. There is finally “the Noah story,” which may possibly symbolize the survival of the Sumerian culture and the end of the Elamite Jemdet Nasr culture. The deposit is like that deposited by river avulsions, a process that was common in the Tigris–Euphrates river system.\n\nArchaeology\nTell Fara extends about a kilometer from north to south. The total area is about 120 hectares, with about 35 hectares of the mound being more than three meters above the surrounding plain, with a maximum of 9 meters. The site consists of two mounds, one larger than the other, separated by an old canal bed as well as a lower town. It was visited by William Loftus in 1850. Hermann Volrath Hilprecht conducted a brief survey in 1900. He found \"copper goatheads; a copper, pre-Sargonid sword; a lamp in the shape of a bird; a very archaic seal cylinder; a number of\npre-Sargonid tablets, and 60 incised plates of mother of pearl\".\nIt was first excavated between 1902 and 1903 by Walter Andrae, Robert Koldewey and Friedrich Delitzsch of the German Oriental Society for eight months. They used a new \"modern\" system which involved excavating trenches 8 feet wide and 5 feet deep every few yards running across the entire width of the larger mound. If a building wall was found in a trench it was further explored. Preliminary identification of the site as Suruppak came from a Ur III period clay nail which mentioned \"Haladda, son of Dada, the patesi of Shuruppak (written SU.KUR.RUki)\nrepaired the ADUS of the Great Gate of the god Shuruppak (written\ndSU.KUR.RU-da)\". Among other finds, 847 cuneiform tablets and 133 tablet fragments of Early Dynastic III period were collected, which ended up in the Berlin Museum and the Istanbul Museum. They included administrative, legal, lexical, and literary texts. Over 100 of the tablets dealt with the disbursement of rations to workers. About a thousand Early Dynastic clay sealings and fragments (used to secure doors and containers) were also found. Most from cylinder seals but 19 were from stamp seals. In 1903 the site was visited by Edgar James Banks who was excavating at the site of Adab, a four-hour walk to the north. Banks took photographs of the German trenches and noted a 20 foot in diameter well, constructed with plano-convex bricks, in the center of the larger mound as well as an arched sewer, similarly constructed. The latter was where tablets were found. Banks also noted that the smaller mound held a cemetery.\n\nIn 1926 it was visited by Raymond P, Dougherty during his archaeological survey of the region. In March and April 1931, a joint team of the American Schools of Oriental Research and the University of Pennsylvania excavated Shuruppak for a further six week season, with Erich Schmidt as director and with epigraphist Samuel Noah Kramer being prompted by reports of illicit excavations in the area. They were able to stratify the major occupation levels as Jemdat Nasr (Fara I), Early Dynastic (Fara II), and Ur III empire (Fara III). There was an \"inundation event\" between Fara I and Fara II. The excavation recovered 96 tablets and fragments—mostly from pre-Sargonic times—biconvex, and unbaked. The tablets included reference to Shuruppak enabling confirmation of the sites original name.\n\nIn 1973, a three-day surface survey of the site was conducted by Harriet P. Martin. Consisting mainly of pottery shard collection, the survey confirmed that Shuruppak dates at least as early as the Jemdet Nasr period, expanded greatly in the Early Dynastic period, and was also an element of the Akkadian Empire and the Third Dynasty of Ur.\nA surface survey and a full magnetometer survey of the site was completed was conducted between 2016 and 2018 by a team from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich led by Adelheid Otto and Berthold Einwag. The initial work was under the regional QADIS survey. A drone was used to create a digital elevation model of the site. The researchers found thousands of robber holes left by looters which had disturbed surface in many places, with the top several meters of the main mound destroyed. They were able to use remains of the 900 meter long trench left by excavators in 1902 and 1903 to orient old excavation documents and aerial mapping with their geomagnetic results. Part of the site was inaccessible because of the spoil heaps from the excavations. A city wall was found (in Area A), which had been missed in the past. A harbor and quay were also found.\nFurther excavations seasons occurred in 2022 and 2024. Work occurred in an area where the early German excavators found over 1000 seal impressions from about 500 seals (trench Id/Ie), in an area now heavily looted out. The seals covered a wide period, Jemdet Nasr, ED I and ED II so it was assumed the area was a rubbish dump. A location was chosen where sand encroachment had somewhat deterred the robbers. a trench was excavated measuring 4 meters long by 3 meters wide, to a depth of 2.5 meters without reaching virgin soil. A total of 180 clay sealings were found often matching those earlier excavated including an unusually large seal (3.5 centimeters) in the \"Elegant Style\". Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) analysis of clay sealings suggested that rather than being deposited over a long period of time all of the various seal styles were being used at the same time.\n\nList of rulers\nThe following list should not be considered complete:\n\nSee also\nList of cities of the ancient Near East\nInstructions of Shuruppak\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nAndrae, W., \"Aus einem Berichte W.

          "content": "Girsu (Sumerian Ĝirsu; cuneiform ĝir2-suki 𒄈𒋢𒆠; modern day Tello) was one of the principal cities of ancient Sumer, serving as the religious capital of the state of Lagash. Continuously inhabited from around 5000 BC to 1750 BC, Girsu flourished as a major sacred, administrative and intellectual centre during the third millennium BC. The city yielded some of the earliest known examples of cuneiform writing, monumental architecture, and complex urban planning, and is today considered one of the key sites for understanding the emergence of civilisation in Mesopotamia.\n\nGeography and Setting\nGirsu lay in southern Mesopotamia, near the modern town of Nasr on the Gharraf River, in Dhi Qar Governorate, Iraq. In antiquity, the city occupied a fertile plain irrigated by canals branching from the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers. The surrounding landscape was rich in wildlife, reeds, and farmland, making it suitable for large-scale irrigation agriculture. Over time, environmental change and shifts in the rivers’ courses turned much of the region into arid landscape.\n\nHistorical Overview\nEarly occupation\nArchaeological evidence shows that Girsu was already inhabited in the Ubaid period (ca. 5000 to 4200 BC). A terracotta figurine of ophidian or 'snake-like' form found in 2018 attests to occupation from these earliest times.\n\nSumerian civilization\nBy the fourth millennium BC, Sumerian communities had founded some of the first true cities in history, including Uruk, Ur, Nippur, Lagash and Girsu. The Sumerians invented writing, wheel-based transport, and developed early forms of geometry, astronomy, and irrigation engineering. Every Sumerian city was dedicated to a patron deity. Girsu was the home of Ningirsu, the warrior god who subdued chaos and maintained cosmic order. As Ningirsu’s sanctuary, Girsu became a revered pilgrimage destination, comparable in importance to later sacred cities.\n\nPolitics and Culture\nGirsu formed part of the wider state of Lagash, which flourished during the Early Dynastic period (ca. 2900–2350 BC). While the political capital alternated between cities, Girsu remained the spiritual and ceremonial heart of the state. Prominent rulers such as Ur-Nanshe, Eannatum, Enmetena, and later Gudea commissioned temples, canals, and monumental sculptures to celebrate Ningirsu. These rulers left inscriptions describing military campaigns, boundary treaties, and temple foundations, providing one of the richest historical records from Early Mesopotamia.\n\nUrban Development\nAt its zenith, Girsu was home to around 20,000 people. The city featured monumental architecture, numerous temples, extensive irrigation canals, warehouses, administrative buildings, residences, and the world’s oldest known bridge. The Sumerians designed complex water-control systems with reservoirs and dams that supported agriculture. Over 100,000 clay tablets have been recovered, revealing an advanced bureaucracy that tracked grain distribution, livestock management, and temple affairs.\n\nReligion and Temples\nNingirsu, often depicted as a lion-headed eagle or Thunderbird, embodied divine power over storms and fertility. His cult dominated religious life in Girsu.\n\nThe Old and New Temples of Ningirsu\nThe Old Temple of Ningirsu stood at the city’s centre for nearly a millennium and was repeatedly rebuilt. Around 2125 BC, the ruler Gudea transferred the main shrine to a new sacred mound and constructed the monumental New Temple of Ningirsu, dedicated to the god as hero and architect of the cosmos. This complex was one of the largest in Mesopotamia and included shrines to Ningirsu and his consort Bau. Nine diorite statues of Gudea depict him as a pious ruler with clasped hands in prayer, emphasising devotion and divine authority.\n\nIconography and artefacts\nNotable finds from Girsu include the Silver Vase of Enmetena (ca. 2350 BC), a limestone mace head carved with the Thunderbird, the Stele of the Vultures (2450–2425 BC), and thousands of administrative cuneiform tablets among the earliest written records in the world.\n\nArchitecture and Engineering\nGirsu demonstrates remarkable Sumerian engineering. Buildings were primarily made of sun-dried and fired mudbricks, often stamped with royal inscriptions.\n\nThe Bridge of Girsu\nThe city’s most extraordinary engineering achievement is the Bridge of Girsu. Today, these are the remains of the oldest bridge structure in the world, dating to around 2000 BC. Discovered in the 1930s and later reidentified by the British Museum and the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage (SBAH) between 2018 and 2023, it served both as a pedestrian crossing and a hydraulic structure that bears strong similarities to modern hydraulic flumes. Its design likely accelerated the water flow and prevented stagnation.\n\nEconomy and Daily Life\nThe prosperity of Girsu relied on irrigation. Water from the Euphrates and Tigris sustained crops of wheat, barley, onions, lentils, and dates. Livestock, fishing, and reed-boat trade complemented agriculture. Temples acted as both religious and economic centres, employing artisans, scribes, and labourers. Archaeological records reveal a highly organised society that meticulously documented production and labour.\n\nDecline and Later History\nGirsu was abandoned around 1750 BC when the Tigris River shifted eastwards, causing severe water shortages. Within decades, its canal network dried up and the city became deserted. However, its sanctity endured – around 330 BC, under Alexander the Great, the main temple was briefly refounded, symbolising a Hellenistic revival of ancient Mesopotamian traditions. Bricks dated to the 4th century BC with a bilingual Greek and Aramaic inscription bearing the name of Adadnadinakhe were found at the shrine, which was dedicated to Heracles and Ningirsu.\n\nArchaeological Exploration\nEarly excavations\nModern rediscovery began in 1877 when the French diplomat Ernest de Sarzec excavated at Tello on behalf of the Louvre Museum. He uncovered temples, archives, and statues of Gudea, revealing the existence of the forgotten Sumerian civilization. Subsequent French archaeologists – Gaston Cros, Henri de Genouillac, and André Parrot – continued work until 1933.\n\nModern research\nAfter an eighty-year hiatus, new excavations resumed in 2015 under the supervision of Sébastien Rey and Fatima Yassir Husain. In 2016 the Tello/Girsu Project was transferred to the British Museum. The Girsu Project, a collaboration between the British Museum and the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, combines fieldwork, digital survey, site conservation and training programs for Iraqi archaeologists.\n\nRecent campaigns at the Mound of the Temple (Tell A) have brought to light major remains of the Temple of Ningirsu built by Gudea in the late third millennium BC. Among the finds were dedicatory tablets and inscribed cones. Archaeologists also uncovered a favissa (ritual pit) containing over 300 fragments of vessels, animal offerings, and cult objects. The assemblage, one of the most complete ritual deposits from Early Dynastic Mesopotamia, offers new insight into the ceremonies of Ningirsu’s temple. Notable items include a bronze duck figurine thought to be linked to Nanshe, and a fragment of an Early Dynastic inscribed calcite vase dedicated to Ningirsu.\nExcavations at Tablet Hill (Tell V, also known as Mound of the Palace) revealed a large administrative and archival complex dating to the Akkadian and Ur III periods. More than 200 cuneiform tablets and numerous Akkadian sealings were recovered, documenting the management of labour, taxation, and supply. These records provide new insights into how imperial power was maintained. One sealing of Naram-Sin proclaims: “Naram-Sin, the mighty, god of Akkad, king of the four quarters: Lugal-ushumgal, the scribe, governor, your servant”. These discoveries illuminate the workings of the Akkadian imperial bureaucracy, described by excavators as the original “tools of empire.”\n\nLegacy\nToday, Girsu stands as a testament to early urban civilisation. Its inscriptions, statues, and artefacts offer invaluable insight into the religious, economic, and artistic achievements of the Sumerians. Artefacts are preserved in the Iraq Museum (Baghdad), the Louvre (Paris), the British Museum (London), and the Istanbul Archaeological Museums. Modern research continues to redefine Girsu as a cradle of human civilization.\n\nGallery\nUbaid Period objects (ca. 5000–4200 BC)\nUruk Period objects (4000–3100 BC)\nEarly Dynastic objects (ca. 2900–2335 BC)\nNeo-Sumerian objects (2120–2210 BC)\nHellenistic objects (ca. 330 BC)\nEarly excavations (1887–1933)\nSee also\nCities of the ancient Near East\nHistory of Mesopotamia\nHistory of Sumer\nList of Mesopotamian dynasties\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\nBarrelet, Marie-Thérèse (1965) ‘Une Construction Enigmatique a Tello’, Iraq, 27 (2), pp. 100–18.\nCros, G.

          "content": "Larsa (Sumerian: 𒌓𒀕𒆠, romanized: UD.UNUGKI, read Larsamki), also referred to as Larancha/Laranchon (Gk. Λαραγχων) by Berossos and connected with the biblical Ellasar, was an important city-state of ancient Sumer, the center of the cult of the sun god Utu with his temple E-babbar. It lies some 25 km (16 mi) southeast of Uruk in Iraq's Dhi Qar Governorate, near the east bank of the Shatt-en-Nil canal at the site of the modern settlement Tell as-Senkereh or Sankarah.\nLarsa is thought to be the source of a number of tablets involving Babylonian mathematics, including the Plimpton 322 tablet that contains patterns of Pythagorean triples.\n\nHistory\nLarsa is found (as UD.UNUG) on Proto-cuneiform lexical lists from the Uruk 4 period (late 4th millennium BC). A few Proto-cuneiform tablets were also found there. Three Neolithic clay tokens, from a slightly early period, were also found at Larsa. For most of its history Larsa was primarily a cult site for the god Utu. In the early part of the 2nd millennium BC the First Dynasty of Lagash made it a major power for perhaps two centuries. The last known occupation was in the Hellenistic period.\n\nEarly Bronze Age\nEarly Dynastic IIIB\nThe historical \"Larsa\" was already in existence as early as the reign of Early Dynastic ruler Eannatum of Lagash (circa 2500–2400 BC), who annexed it to his empire. In a large victory stele found at Girsu he wrote:\n\n\"... E-anatum was very clever indeed and he made up the eyes of two doves with kohl, and adorned their heads with cedar (resin). For the god Utu, master of vegetation, in the E-babbar at Larsa, he had them offered as sacrificial bulls.\"\n\nA later ruler, Entemena, nephew of Eannatum, is recorded on a foundation cone found at nearby Bad-Tibira as cancelling the debts of the citizens of Larsa \"He cancelled [oblig]ations for the citizens of Uruk, Larsa, and Pa-tibira ... He restored (the second) to the god Utu’s control in Larsa ...\".\n\nAkkadian period\nLarsa is attested in the Akkadian Empire in the Temple Hymns of Enheduanna, daughter of Sargon of Akkad.\n\n\"... Your lord is the soaring sunlight, the ruler ... righteous voice. He lights up the horizon, he lights up the zenith of heaven. Utu, lord of the Shining House,has built a home in your holy court, House of Larsa, and has taken his seat upon your throne.\"\n\nUr III period\nIn the Ur III empire period that ended the millennium, its first ruler Ur-Nammu recorded, in a brick inscription found at Larse, rebuilding the E-babbar temple of Utu there.\n\nMiddle Bronze Age\nThe city became a political force during the Isin-Larsa period. After the Third Dynasty of Ur collapsed c. 2004 BC, Ishbi-Erra, an official of the last king of the Third Dynasty of Ur, Ibbi-Sin, relocated to Isin and set up a government which purported to be the successor to the Third Dynasty of Ur. From there, Ishbi-Erra recaptured Ur as well as the cities of Uruk and Lagash, which Larsa was subject to. Subsequent rulers of Isin appointed governors to rule over Larsa; one such governor was an Amorite named Gungunum. He eventually broke with Isin and established an independent dynasty in Larsa. To legitimize his rule and deliver a blow to Isin, Gungunum captured the city of Ur. In his year names he recorded the defeat of the distant Anshan in Elam as well as city-states closer to Larsa such as Malgium. As the region of Larsa was the main center of trade via the Persian Gulf, Isin lost an enormously profitable trade route, as well as a city with much cultic significance.\nGungunum's two successors, Abisare (c. 1905–1894 BC) and Sumuel (c. 1894–1865 BC), both took steps to cut Isin completely off from access to canals. Isin quickly lost political and economic influence.\n\nLarsa grew powerful, but never accumulated a large territory. At its peak under king Rim-Sin I (c. 1822–1763 BC), Larsa controlled about 10–15 other city-states. In the latter half of this period the city of Mashkan-shapir acted as a second capital of the city-state. Nevertheless, huge building projects and agricultural undertakings can be detected archaeologically. After the defeat of Rim-Sin I by Hammurabi of Babylon, Larsa became a minor site, though it has been suggested that it was the home of the First Sealand Dynasty of Babylon.\n\nIron Age\nLarsa was known to be active during the Neo-Babylonian, Achaemenid, and Hellenistic periods based on building brick inscriptions as well as a number of cuneiform texts from the Larsa temple of Samash which were found in Uruk. The E-babbar of Utu/Shamash was destroyed by fire in the 2nd century BC and the area re-used for poorly built private homes. The entire site was abandoned by the 1st century BC.\n\nList of rulers\nThe following list should not be considered complete:\n\nArchaeology\nThe remains of Larsa cover an area of about 200 hectares. The highest point is around 70 ft (21 m) in height.\nThe site of Tell es-Senkereh was first excavated, under the rudimentary archaeological standards of his day, by William Loftus in 1850 for less than a month. Loftus recovered building bricks of Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire which enabled the site's identification as the ancient city of Larsa. Much of the effort by Loftus was on the temple of Shamash, rebuilt by Nebuchadnezzar II. Inscriptions of Burna-Buriash II of the Kassite dynasty of Babylon and Hammurabi of the First Babylonian dynasty were also found. Larsa was also briefly worked by Walter Andrae in 1903. The site was inspected by Edgar James Banks in 1905. He found that widespread looting by the local population was occurring there.\nThe first modern, scientific, excavation of Senkereh occurred in 1933, with the work of André Parrot.\nParrot worked at the location again in 1967.\nIn 1969 and 1970, Larsa was excavated by Jean-Claude Margueron.\nBetween 1976 and 1991, an expedition of the Delegation Archaeologic Francaise en Irak led by J-L. Huot excavated at Tell es-Senereh for 13 seasons. The primary focus of the excavation was the Neo-Babylonian E-Babbar temple of Utu/Shamash. Floors and wall repairs showed its continued use in the Hellenistic period. A tablet, found on the earliest Hellenistic floor, was dated to the reign of Philip Arrhidaeus (320 BC). Soundings showed that the Neo-Babylonian temple followed that plan of the prior Kassite and earlier temples. Numerous inscriptions and cuneiform tablets were found representing the reigns of numerous rulers, from Ur-Nammu  to Hammurabi all the way up to Nebuchadnezzar II.\nIn 2019 excavations were resumed. The first season began with a topographic survey, by drone and surface survey, to refine and correct the mapping from early excavations. Excavation was focused on a large construction of the Hellenistic period built north of the E-Babbar temple. The first season included a magnetometer survey. Excavations continued with one month seasons in 2021 and 2022. They have been able to trace a very large system of internal canals and a port area, all linked to the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Old Babylonian times. In a destroyed level of the Grand Viziers residence 59 cuneiform tablets, fragments and envelopes dated to the time of Gungunum and Abisare were found. Geophysical work continued including on the 10-20 meter wide rampart wall that enclosed Larsa, with six main gates. Magnetic surveys using a caesium gradiometer\nhave discovered a massive baked brick water gate in the 15 meter wide mud brick wall on the western side. The\ngate permitted the passage of one of the large canals that passed through Larsa. A pedestrian gate\nwas adjacent. Other portions of the 5376 meter long city wall (20 meters wide in places) were also surveyed and work this continues at the site.\n\nSee also\nCities of the ancient Near East\nShort chronology timeline\nLetter from Iddin-Sin to Zinu\nTell Sifr\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\n[9] Abid, Basima Jalil, and Ahmed Naji Sabee, \"The fattening barn in Larsa and its role in providing the cities with offerings (Naptanu) from the reign of the King Rim Sin\", ISIN Journal 1, 2021\nArnaud, Daniel, \"Catalogue Des Textes Trouvés Au Cours Des Fouilles et Des Explorations Régulières de La Mission Française a Tell Senkereh-Larsa En 1969 et 1970\", Syria, vol. 48, no. 3/4, pp. 289–93, 1971\nArnaud, Daniel, Texte aus Larsa.

          "content": "Eridu (Sumerian: 𒉣𒆠, romanized: NUN.KI; Sumerian: eridugki; Akkadian: irîtu) was a Sumerian city located at Tell Abu Shahrain (Arabic: تل أبو شهرين), also Abu Shahrein or Tell Abu Shahrayn, an archaeological site in Lower Mesopotamia. It is located in Dhi Qar Governorate, Iraq, near the modern city of Basra. Eridu is traditionally considered the earliest city in southern Mesopotamia based on the Sumerian King List. Located 24 km (15 mi) south-southwest of the ancient site of Ur, Eridu was the southernmost of a conglomeration of Sumerian cities that grew around temples, almost in sight of one another. The city gods of Eridu were Enki and his consort Damkina. Enki, later known as Ea, was considered to have founded the city. His temple was called E-Abzu, as Enki was believed to live in Abzu, an aquifer from which all life was thought to stem. According to Sumerian temple hymns, another name for the temple of Ea/Enki was called Esira (Esirra).\n\n\"... The temple is constructed with gold and lapis lazuli, Its foundation on the nether-sea (apsu) is filled in. By the river of Sippar (Euphrates) it stands. O Apsu pure place of propriety, Esira, may thy king stand within thee. ...\"\nAt nearby Ur there was a temple of Ishtar of Eridu (built by Lagash's ruler Ur-Baba) and a sanctuary of Inanna of Eridu (built by Ur III ruler Ur-Nammu). Ur-Nammu also recorded building a temple of Ishtar of Eridu at Ur which is assumed to have been a rebuild.\nOne of the religious quarters of Babylon, containing the temple called the Esagila as well as the temple of Annunitum, among others, was also named Eridu.\n\nArchaeology\nEridu is located on a natural hill in a basin approximately 15 miles (24 km) long and 20 feet (6.1 m) deep, which is separated from the Euphrates River by a sandstone ridge called the Hazem. This basin, the As Sulaybiyat Depression (formerly: Khor en-Nejeif), becomes a seasonal lake (Arabic: Sebkha) during the rainy season from November to April.  During this period, it is filled by the discharge of the Wadi Khanega.  Adjacent to eastern edge of the seasonal lake are the Hammar Marshes.\nIn the 3rd Millennium BC a canal, Id-edin-Eriduga (NUN)ki \"the  canal  of  the  Eridug  plain\", connected Eridu to the Euphrates River, which later shifted its course. The path of the canal is marked by several low tells with 2nd Millennium BC surface pottery and later burials. The site contains 8 mounds:\n\nMound 1 - Abū Šahrain, 580 by 540 metres (1,900 ft × 1,770 ft) in area NW to WE, 25 metres (82 ft) in height, Enki Temple,  Ur III Ziggurat (É-u₆-nir) Sacred Area, Early Dynastic plano-convex bricks found, Ubaid Period cemetery\nMound 2 – 350 by 350 metres (1,100 ft × 1,100 ft) in area, 4.3 metres (14 ft) in height, 1 km (0.62 mi) N of Abū Šahrain, Early Dynastic Palace, remnants of city wall built with plano-convex bricks\nMound 3 - 300 by 150 metres (980 ft × 490 ft) in area, 2.5 m (8.2 ft) high, 2.2 km (1.4 mi) SSW of Abū Šahrain, Isin-Larsa pottery found\nMound 4 - 600 by 300 metres (2,000 ft × 980 ft) in area, 2.5 km (1.6 mi) SW of Abū Šahrain, Kassite pottery found\nMound 5 - 500 by 300 metres (1,600 ft × 980 ft) in area, 3 m (9.8 ft) high, 1.5 km (0.93 mi) SE of Abū Šahrain, Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid periods\nMound 6 - 300 by 200 metres (980 ft × 660 ft) in area, 2 m (6.6 ft) high, 2.5 km (1.6 mi) SW of Abū Šahrain\nMound 7 - 400 by 200 metres (1,300 ft × 660 ft) in area, 1.5 m (4.9 ft) high, 3 km (1.9 mi) E of Abū Šahrai\nMound 8 - Usalla, flat area, 8 km (5 mi) NW of Abū Šahrain, Hajj Mohammed and later Ubaid\n\nThe site was initially excavated by John George Taylor, the British Vice-counsel at Basra, in 1855. Among the finds were inscribed bricks enabling the identification of the site as Eridu. Excavation on the main tell next occurred by R. Campbell Thompson from April 10 until May 8 in 1918, and H. R. Hall from April 21 until May 8 in 1919, who also conducted a survey in the area around the tell. An interesting find by Hall was a piece of manufactured blue glass which he dated to c. 2000 BC. The blue color was achieved with cobalt, long before this technique emerged in Egypt.\nThis lump of glass is currently dated to the 21st century BC or even earlier, and is considered as perhaps the earliest such glass object in the world in the History of glass. It was produced during the Akkadian Empire or the early Ur III period.\n\nExcavation there resumed from 1946 to 1949 under Fuad Safar and Seton Lloyd of the Iraqi Directorate General of Antiquities and Heritage. Among the finds were a Ubaid period terracotta boat model, complete with a socket amidship for a mast and hole for stays and rudder, bevel-rimmed bowls, and a \"lizard type\" figurine like those found in a sounding under the Royal Cemetery of Ur. Soundings in the cemetery showed it to have about 1000 graves, all from the end of the Ubaid period (Temple levels VI and VII). They found a sequence of 17 Ubaid Period superseding temples and an Ubaid Period graveyard with 1000 graves of mud-brick boxes oriented to the southeast. The temple began as a 2 m × 3 m (6 ft 7 in × 9 ft 10 in) mud brick square with a niche. At Level XI it was rebuilt and eventually reached its final tripartite form in Level VI. In Ur III times a 300 square meter platform was constructed as a base for a ziggurat. These archaeological investigations showed that, according to A. Leo Oppenheim, \"eventually the entire south lapsed into stagnation, abandoning the political initiative to the rulers of the northern cities\", probably as a result of increasing salinity produced by continuous irrigation, and the city was abandoned in 600 BC. In 1990 the site was visited by A. M. T. Moore who found two areas of surface pottery kilns not noted by the earlier excavators.\nIn October 2014, Franco D’Agostino visited the site in preparation for the coming resumption of excavation, noting a number of inscribed Amar-Sin brick fragments on the surface. In 2019, excavations at Eridu were resumed by a joint Italian, French, and Iraqi effort which included the University of Rome La Sapienza and the University of Strasbourg. Work has included producing new detail topographic and photogrammetric maps and is mainly focused on the Ubaid period cemetery and its associated Ubaid residential area.\n\nArtifacts\nIn March 2006, Giovanni Pettinato and S. Chiod from Rome's La Sapienza University claimed to have discovered 500 Early Dynastic historical and literary cuneiform tablets on the surface at Eridu \"disturbed by an explosion\". The tablets were said to be from 2600 to 2100 BC (rulers Eannatum to Amar-Sin) and be part of a library. A team was sent to the site by Iraq's State Board of Antiquities and Heritage which found no tablets, only stamped bricks from Eridu and surrounding sites such as Ur. Nor was there a permit to excavate at the site issued to anyone. At this point Pettinato stated that they had actually found 70 inscribed bricks. This turned out to be stamped bricks used to build the modern Eridu dig-house. The dig-house had been built using bricks from the demolished Leonard Woolley’s  expedition house at Ur (clearly spelled out in the 1981 Iraqi excavation report to avoid confusion to future archaeologists). Most of the bricks\nin question were returned to Ur in 1962 for use in restoration efforts.\n\nArchitecture\nTemple and ziggurat\nThe urban nucleus of Eridu was Enki's temple, called House of the Aquifer (Cuneiform: 𒂍𒍪𒀊, E₂.ZU.AB; Sumerian: e₂-abzu; Akkadian: bītu apsû), which in later history was called House of the Waters (Cuneiform: 𒂍𒇉, E₂.LAGAB×HAL; Sumerian: e₂-engur; Akkadian: bītu engurru). The name refers to Enki's realm. His consort Ninhursag had a nearby temple at Ubaid.\nDuring the Ur III period, Ur-Nammu had a ziggurat built over the remains of previous temples. Aside from Enmerkar of Uruk (as mentioned in the Aratta epics), several later historical Sumerian kings are said in inscriptions found here to have worked on or renewed the e-abzu temple, including Elili of Ur; Ur-Nammu, Shulgi and Amar-Sin of Ur-III, and Nur-Adad of Larsa.\n\nLament for Eridu\nThe fall of early Mesopotamia cities and empires was typically believed to be the result of falling out of favor with the gods. A genre called City Laments developed during the Isin-Larsa period, of which the Lament for Ur is the most famous. These laments had a number of sections (kirugu) of which only fragments have been recovered. The Lament for Eridu describes the fall of that city.\n\nIts king stayed outside his city as if it were an alien city. He wept bitter tears. Father Enki stayed outside his city as if it were an alien city. He wept bitter tears. For the sake of his harmed city, he wept bitter tears. Its lady, like a flying bird, left her city. The mother of E-maḫ, holy Damgalnuna, left her city. The divine powers of the city of holiest divine powers were overturned. The divine powers of the rites of the greatest divine powers were altered. In Eridug everything was reduced to ruin, was wrought with confusion.\n\nHistory\nEridu is one of the earliest settlements in the region, founded c. 5400 BC during the early Ubaid period, at that time close to the Persian Gulf near the mouth of the Euphrates, although in modern times it is about 90 miles inland. Excavation has shown that the city was founded on a virgin sand dune site with no previous habitation. According to the excavators, construction of the Ur III ziggurat and associated buildings was preceded by the destruction of preceding construction and its use as leveling fill so no remains from that time were found. At a small mound 1 kilometer north of Eridu two Early Dynastic III palaces were found, with an enclosure wall. The palaces measured 45 meters by 65 meters with 2.6 meter wide walls and were constructed in the standard Early Dynastic period method of plano-convex bricks laid in a herringbone fashion.\n\nWith possible breaks in occupation in the Early Dynastic III and Akkadian Empire periods, the city was inhabited until the Neo-Babylonian Empire, though in later times it was primarily a cultic site.\n\nDuring the Ubaid period the site extended out to an area of about 12 hectares (about 30 acres). Twelve neolithic clay tokens, the precursor to Proto-cuneiform, were found in the Ubaid levels of the site. Eighteen superimposed mudbrick temples at the site underlie the unfinished ziggurat of Amar-Sin (c. 2047–2039 BC). Levels XIX to VI were from the Ubaid period and Levels V to I were dated to the Uruk period. Significant habitation was found from the Uruk period with \"non-secular\" buildings being found in soundings. Uruk finds included decorative terracotta cones topped with copper, copper nails topped with gold, a pair of basalt stone lion statues, columns several meters in diameter coated with cones and gypsum, and extensive Uruk period pottery. Occupation increased in the Early Dynastic period with a monumental 100 m × 100 m (330 ft × 330 ft) palace being constructed. An inscription of Elulu, a ruler of the First Dynasty of Ur (c. 2600 BC), was found at Eridu. On a statue of the Early Dynastic ruler of Lagash named Entemena (c. 2400 BC), it reads, \"he built Ab-zupasira for Enki, king of Eridu  ...\",\n\nEridu was active during the Third Dynasty of Ur (22nd to 21st century BC) and royal building activity is known from inscribed bricks notably those of Ur-Nammu from his ziggurat marked \"Ur-Nammu, king of Ur, the one who built the temple of the god Enki in Eridu.\" Three Third Dynasty rulers designated Year Names based on the appointment of an en(tu)-priestess (high priestess) of the temple of Enki in Eridu, the highest religious office in the land at that time. In each the first two cases it was also used as the succeeding Year Name.\n\nSulgi Year 28 - \"Year the szita-priest-who-intercedes-for-Szulgi, the son of Szulgi, the strong man, the king of Ur, the king of the four corners of the universe, was installed as en-priest of Enki in Eridu\"\nAmar-Sin Year 8 - \"Year (Ennune-kiag-Amar-Sin) Ennune-the beloved (of Amar-Sin, was installed as en-priestess of Enki in Eridu)\"\nIbbi-Sin Year 11 - \"Year the szita-priest who prays piously for Ibbi-Sin was chosen by means of the omens as en-priest of Enki in Eridu\"\n\nAfter the fall of Ur III the site was occupied and active during the Isin-Larsa period  (early 2nd Millennium BC) as evidenced by a Year Name of Nur-Adad, ruler of Larsa \"Year the temple of Enki in Eridu was built\" and prior texts of Isin rulers Ishbi-Erra and Ishme-Dagan showing control over Eridu. Inscribed construction bricks of Nur-Adad have also been found at Eridu. This continued in the Old Babylonian period with Hammurabi stating in his 33rd Year Name \"Year Hammu-rabi the king dug the canal (called) 'Hammu-rabi is abundance to the people', the beloved of An and Enlil, established the everlasting waters of plentifulness for Nippur, Eridu, Ur, Larsa, Uruk and Isin, restored Sumer and Akkad which had been scattered, overthrew in battle the army of Mari and Malgium and caused Mari and its territory and the various cities of Subartu to dwell under his authority in friendship\"\n\nIn an inscription of Kurigalzu I (c. 1375 BC), a ruler of the Kassite dynasty one of his epitaphs is \"[he  one  who  ke]eps  the  sanctuary  in  Eridu  in  order\".\nAn inscription of the Second Sealand Dynastic ruler Simbar-shipak (c. 1021–1004 BCE) mentions a priest of Eridu.\nThe Neo-Assyrian emperor Sargon II (722–705 BCE) awarded andurāru-status (described as \"a periodic reinstatement of goods and persons, alienated because of want, to their original status\") to Eridu.\nThe Neo-Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 BC) built at Eridu as evidenced by inscribed bricks found there.\n\nMythology\nIn some, but not all, versions of the Sumerian King List, Eridu is the first of five cities where kingship was received before a flood came over the land. The list mentions two rulers of Eridu from the Early Dynastic period, Alulim and Alalngar.\n\nIn Sumerian mythology, Eridu was the home of the Abzu temple of the god Enki, the Sumerian counterpart of the Akkadian god Ea, god of deep waters, wisdom and magic. Like all the Sumerian and Babylonian gods, Enki/Ea began as a local god who, according to the later cosmology, came to share the rule of the cosmos with Anu and Enlil. His kingdom was the sweet waters that lay below earth (Sumerian ab=water; zu=far).\nThe bright star Canopus was known to the ancient Mesopotamians and represented the city of Eridu in the Three Stars Each Babylonian star catalogues and later around 1100 BC on the MUL.APIN tablets. Canopus was called MUL.NUNKI by the Babylonians, which translates as \"star of the city of Eridu\". From most southern city of Mesopotamia, Eridu, there is a good view to the south, so that about 6000 years ago due to the precession of the Earth's axis the first rising of the star Canopus in Mesopotamia could be observed only from there at the southern meridian at midnight. In the city of Ur this was the case only 60 years later.\nIn the flood myth tablet found in Ur, how Eridu and Alulim were chosen by gods as first city and first priest-king is described in more detail. The following is the English translation of the tablet:\n\nAdapa, a man of Eridu, is depicted as an early culture hero. Although earlier tradition, Me-Turan/Tell-Haddad tablet, describes Adapa as postdiluvian ruler of Eridu, in late tradition, Adapa came to be viewed as Alulim’s vizier, and he was considered to have brought civilization to the city as the sage of King Alulim.\n\nThe stories of Inanna, goddess of Uruk, describe how she had to go to Eridu in order to receive the gifts of civilization. At first Enki, the god of Eridu, attempted to retrieve these sources of his power but later willingly accepted that Uruk now was the centre of the land.\n\nList of rulers\nThe following list should not be considered complete:\n\nSee also\nAbzu\nCities of the Ancient Near East\nEridu Genesis\nLake Hammar\nTepe Gawra\n\nReferences\nCitations\nFurther reading\nEspak, Peeter, \"Was Eridu The First City in Sumerian Mythology\", Studia in Honorem Tarmo Kulmar.
