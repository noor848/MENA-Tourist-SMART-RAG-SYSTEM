      "content": "Girsu (Sumerian Ĝirsu; cuneiform ĝir2-suki 𒄈𒋢𒆠; modern day Tello) was one of the principal cities of ancient Sumer, serving as the religious capital of the state of Lagash. Continuously inhabited from around 5000 BC to 1750 BC, Girsu flourished as a major sacred, administrative and intellectual centre during the third millennium BC. The city yielded some of the earliest known examples of cuneiform writing, monumental architecture, and complex urban planning, and is today considered one of the key sites for understanding the emergence of civilisation in Mesopotamia.\n\nGeography and Setting\nGirsu lay in southern Mesopotamia, near the modern town of Nasr on the Gharraf River, in Dhi Qar Governorate, Iraq. In antiquity, the city occupied a fertile plain irrigated by canals branching from the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers. The surrounding landscape was rich in wildlife, reeds, and farmland, making it suitable for large-scale irrigation agriculture. Over time, environmental change and shifts in the rivers’ courses turned much of the region into arid landscape.\n\nHistorical Overview\nEarly occupation\nArchaeological evidence shows that Girsu was already inhabited in the Ubaid period (ca. 5000 to 4200 BC). A terracotta figurine of ophidian or 'snake-like' form found in 2018 attests to occupation from these earliest times.\n\nSumerian civilization\nBy the fourth millennium BC, Sumerian communities had founded some of the first true cities in history, including Uruk, Ur, Nippur, Lagash and Girsu. The Sumerians invented writing, wheel-based transport, and developed early forms of geometry, astronomy, and irrigation engineering. Every Sumerian city was dedicated to a patron deity. Girsu was the home of Ningirsu, the warrior god who subdued chaos and maintained cosmic order. As Ningirsu’s sanctuary, Girsu became a revered pilgrimage destination, comparable in importance to later sacred cities.\n\nPolitics and Culture\nGirsu formed part of the wider state of Lagash, which flourished during the Early Dynastic period (ca. 2900–2350 BC). While the political capital alternated between cities, Girsu remained the spiritual and ceremonial heart of the state. Prominent rulers such as Ur-Nanshe, Eannatum, Enmetena, and later Gudea commissioned temples, canals, and monumental sculptures to celebrate Ningirsu. These rulers left inscriptions describing military campaigns, boundary treaties, and temple foundations, providing one of the richest historical records from Early Mesopotamia.\n\nUrban Development\nAt its zenith, Girsu was home to around 20,000 people. The city featured monumental architecture, numerous temples, extensive irrigation canals, warehouses, administrative buildings, residences, and the world’s oldest known bridge. The Sumerians designed complex water-control systems with reservoirs and dams that supported agriculture. Over 100,000 clay tablets have been recovered, revealing an advanced bureaucracy that tracked grain distribution, livestock management, and temple affairs.\n\nReligion and Temples\nNingirsu, often depicted as a lion-headed eagle or Thunderbird, embodied divine power over storms and fertility. His cult dominated religious life in Girsu.\n\nThe Old and New Temples of Ningirsu\nThe Old Temple of Ningirsu stood at the city’s centre for nearly a millennium and was repeatedly rebuilt. Around 2125 BC, the ruler Gudea transferred the main shrine to a new sacred mound and constructed the monumental New Temple of Ningirsu, dedicated to the god as hero and architect of the cosmos. This complex was one of the largest in Mesopotamia and included shrines to Ningirsu and his consort Bau. Nine diorite statues of Gudea depict him as a pious ruler with clasped hands in prayer, emphasising devotion and divine authority.\n\nIconography and artefacts\nNotable finds from Girsu include the Silver Vase of Enmetena (ca. 2350 BC), a limestone mace head carved with the Thunderbird, the Stele of the Vultures (2450–2425 BC), and thousands of administrative cuneiform tablets among the earliest written records in the world.\n\nArchitecture and Engineering\nGirsu demonstrates remarkable Sumerian engineering. Buildings were primarily made of sun-dried and fired mudbricks, often stamped with royal inscriptions.\n\nThe Bridge of Girsu\nThe city’s most extraordinary engineering achievement is the Bridge of Girsu. Today, these are the remains of the oldest bridge structure in the world, dating to around 2000 BC. Discovered in the 1930s and later reidentified by the British Museum and the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage (SBAH) between 2018 and 2023, it served both as a pedestrian crossing and a hydraulic structure that bears strong similarities to modern hydraulic flumes. Its design likely accelerated the water flow and prevented stagnation.\n\nEconomy and Daily Life\nThe prosperity of Girsu relied on irrigation. Water from the Euphrates and Tigris sustained crops of wheat, barley, onions, lentils, and dates. Livestock, fishing, and reed-boat trade complemented agriculture. Temples acted as both religious and economic centres, employing artisans, scribes, and labourers. Archaeological records reveal a highly organised society that meticulously documented production and labour.\n\nDecline and Later History\nGirsu was abandoned around 1750 BC when the Tigris River shifted eastwards, causing severe water shortages. Within decades, its canal network dried up and the city became deserted. However, its sanctity endured – around 330 BC, under Alexander the Great, the main temple was briefly refounded, symbolising a Hellenistic revival of ancient Mesopotamian traditions. Bricks dated to the 4th century BC with a bilingual Greek and Aramaic inscription bearing the name of Adadnadinakhe were found at the shrine, which was dedicated to Heracles and Ningirsu.\n\nArchaeological Exploration\nEarly excavations\nModern rediscovery began in 1877 when the French diplomat Ernest de Sarzec excavated at Tello on behalf of the Louvre Museum. He uncovered temples, archives, and statues of Gudea, revealing the existence of the forgotten Sumerian civilization. Subsequent French archaeologists – Gaston Cros, Henri de Genouillac, and André Parrot – continued work until 1933.\n\nModern research\nAfter an eighty-year hiatus, new excavations resumed in 2015 under the supervision of Sébastien Rey and Fatima Yassir Husain. In 2016 the Tello/Girsu Project was transferred to the British Museum. The Girsu Project, a collaboration between the British Museum and the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, combines fieldwork, digital survey, site conservation and training programs for Iraqi archaeologists.\n\nRecent campaigns at the Mound of the Temple (Tell A) have brought to light major remains of the Temple of Ningirsu built by Gudea in the late third millennium BC. Among the finds were dedicatory tablets and inscribed cones. Archaeologists also uncovered a favissa (ritual pit) containing over 300 fragments of vessels, animal offerings, and cult objects. The assemblage, one of the most complete ritual deposits from Early Dynastic Mesopotamia, offers new insight into the ceremonies of Ningirsu’s temple. Notable items include a bronze duck figurine thought to be linked to Nanshe, and a fragment of an Early Dynastic inscribed calcite vase dedicated to Ningirsu.\nExcavations at Tablet Hill (Tell V, also known as Mound of the Palace) revealed a large administrative and archival complex dating to the Akkadian and Ur III periods. More than 200 cuneiform tablets and numerous Akkadian sealings were recovered, documenting the management of labour, taxation, and supply. These records provide new insights into how imperial power was maintained. One sealing of Naram-Sin proclaims: “Naram-Sin, the mighty, god of Akkad, king of the four quarters: Lugal-ushumgal, the scribe, governor, your servant”. These discoveries illuminate the workings of the Akkadian imperial bureaucracy, described by excavators as the original “tools of empire.”\n\nLegacy\nToday, Girsu stands as a testament to early urban civilisation. Its inscriptions, statues, and artefacts offer invaluable insight into the religious, economic, and artistic achievements of the Sumerians. Artefacts are preserved in the Iraq Museum (Baghdad), the Louvre (Paris), the British Museum (London), and the Istanbul Archaeological Museums. Modern research continues to redefine Girsu as a cradle of human civilization.\n\nGallery\nUbaid Period objects (ca. 5000–4200 BC)\nUruk Period objects (4000–3100 BC)\nEarly Dynastic objects (ca. 2900–2335 BC)\nNeo-Sumerian objects (2120–2210 BC)\nHellenistic objects (ca. 330 BC)\nEarly excavations (1887–1933)\nSee also\nCities of the ancient Near East\nHistory of Mesopotamia\nHistory of Sumer\nList of Mesopotamian dynasties\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\nBarrelet, Marie-Thérèse (1965) ‘Une Construction Enigmatique a Tello’, Iraq, 27 (2), pp. 100–18.\nCros, G.
