      "content": "Baghdad is the capital and largest city in Iraq. It is located on the banks of the Tigris in central Iraq. The city has an estimated population of 8 million. It ranks among the most populous and largest cities in the Middle East and the Arab world and constitutes 22% of the country's population. Baghdad is a primary financial and commercial center in the region.\nFounded in 762 AD by Al-Mansur, Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate and became its most notable development project. The city evolved into an intellectual and cultural center. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the House of Wisdom, as well as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious environment, garnered it a worldwide reputation as the \"Center of Learning\". For much of the Abbasid era, during the Islamic Golden Age, Baghdad was one of the largest cities in the world and rivaled Chang'an, as the population peaked at more than one million. It was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues, shift in power and multiple successive empires. Later, Baghdad served as the administrative center of Ottoman Iraq, exercising authority over the provinces of Basra, Mosul, and Shahrizor.\nDuring the First World War, Baghdad was made the capital of Mandatory Iraq. With the recognition of Iraq as an independent monarchy in 1932, it gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of Arab culture. During the Ba'ath Party rule, the city experienced a period of relative prosperity and growth. However, it faced severe infrastructural damage due to the Iraq War, which began with the invasion of Iraq in 2003, resulting in a substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts. During the insurgency and renewed war from 2013 to 2017, it had one of the highest rates of terrorist attacks in the world. However, these attacks have gradually declined since the territorial defeat of the Islamic State militant group in Iraq in 2017, and are now rare. Since the end of the war, numerous reconstruction projects have been underway to induce stability.\nIraq's largest city, Baghdad is the seat of government. It generates 40% of the economy of Iraq. A major center of Islamic history, Baghdad is home to numerous historic mosques, as well as churches, mandis and synagogues, highlighting the city's historical diversity. Religious sites such as Masjid al-Kadhimayn, Buratha Mosque, the Shrine of Abdul-Qadir Gilani and Abu Hanifa Mosque are visited by millions of people annually. It was once home to a large Jewish community and was regularly visited by Sikh pilgrims from India. Baghdad is a regional cultural hub. The city is well known for its coffeehouses.\n\nName\nThe name Baghdad is pre-Islamic, and its origin is disputed. The site where the city of Baghdad developed has been populated for millennia. Archaeological evidence shows that the site of Baghdad was occupied by various peoples long before the Arab conquest of Mesopotamia in 637 CE, and several ancient empires had capitals located in the surrounding area.\nArab authors, realizing the pre-Islamic origins of Baghdad's name, generally looked for its roots in Middle Persian. They suggested various meanings, the most common of which was \"bestowed by God\". Modern scholars generally tend to favor this etymology, which views the word as a Persian compound of bagh () \"god\" and dād () \"given\". In Old Persian the first element can be traced to boghu and is related to Indo-Iranian bhag and Slavic bog \"god.\" A similar term in Middle Persian is the name Mithradāt (Mehrdad in New Persian), known in English by its borrowed Hellenistic form Mithridates, meaning \"Given by Mithra\" (dāt is the more archaic form of dād, related to Sanskrit dāt, Latin dat and English donor), ultimately borrowed from Persian Mehrdad. There are a number of other locations whose names are compounds of the Middle Persian word bagh, including Baghlan and Bagram in Afghanistan, Baghshan in Iran itself, and Baghdati in Georgia, which likely share the same etymological Iranic origins.\nOther authors have suggested older origins for the name, in particular the name Bagdadu or Hudadu that existed in Old Babylonian (spelled with a sign that can represent both bag and hu), and the Jewish Babylonian Aramaic name of a place called Baghdatha (בגדתא). Some scholars suggested Aramaic derivations.\nAnother highly recommended view is that Baghdad is a reference to Bagh and Dad as in Dadan, Dedan, and Dad as in Hadad, Adad. Another view suggested by Christophe Wall-Romana, is that name of \"Baghdad\" is derived from \"Akkad\", as the cuneiform logogram for Akkad (𒀀𒂵𒉈𒆠) is pronounced \"a-ga-dèKI\" (\"Agade\") and its resemblance to \"Baghdad\" is compelling. It is argued that, throughout all the various spellings of the city's name, whether Baghdad [بغداد], Baghdadh [بغداذ], Baghdan [بغدان], Maghdad [مغداد], Maghdadh [مغداذ], or Maghdan [مغدان], the only phonetically definite segment of the name appears to be Aghda [ىَغْدَا], which could be equated with the pronunciation of the name Agade.\nWhen the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur founded a completely new city for his capital, he chose the name \"City of peace\" (Arabic: مدینة السلام, romanized: Madīnat as-Salām), which now refers to the Round City of Baghdad proper. By the 11th century, Baghdad became almost the exclusive name for the world-renowned metropolis.\nChristophe Wall-Romana has suggested that al-Mansur's choice to found his \"new city\" at Baghdad because of its strategic location was the same criteria which influenced Sargon's choice to found the original city of Akkad in the exact same location.\n\nHistory\nFoundation\nAfter the fall of the Umayyads, the victorious Abbasids sought a new capital. On 30 July 762, the Caliph Al-Mansur commissioned Baghdad's construction, guided by the Iranian Barmakids. He believed Baghdad was ideal for ruling the Islamic Empire. Historian al-Tabari recorded a prophecy from Christian monks about a leader named Miklas building a great city in the area, and Al-Mansur, who was once called Miklas, saw this as a good omen. He expressed deep affection for the site, declaring it would be the home of his dynasty.\nThe two designers who were hired by Al-Mansur to plan the city's design were Naubakht, a Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city would be astrologically auspicious, and Mashallah, a Jew from Khorasan, Iran. They determined the city's auspicious founding date under the sign of Leo the lion, symbolizing strength and expansion.\nBaghdad's strategic location along the Tigris and its abundant water supply contributed to its rapid growth. It was divided into three judicial districts: Round City (Madinat al-Mansur), al-Karkh (al-Sharqiyya), and Askar al-Mahdi. To prevent disturbances, Al-Mansur moved markets to al-Karkh. Over time, Baghdad became a hub for merchants and craftsmen. Officials called \"Muhtasib\" monitored trade to prevent fraud.\nBaghdad surpassed Ctesiphon, the former Sassanid capital, located 30 km southeast. The ruins of Ctesiphon remain in Salman Pak, where Salman the Persian is believed to be buried. Ctesiphon itself had replaced Seleucia, which had earlier succeeded Babylon. According to the traveler Ibn Battuta, Baghdad was one of the largest cities, not including the damage it has received. The residents are mostly Hanbalis. Most residents were Hanbali Muslims. The city housed Abu Hanifa's grave, marked by a mosque and cell. Its ruler, Abu Said Bahadur Khan, was a Tatar who had embraced Islam.\nBaghdad was designed to symbolize Paradise as described in the Qur'an. It took four years (764–768) to build, with over 100,000 workers involved. Al-Mansur recruited engineers and artisans worldwide. Astrologers Naubakht Ahvazi and Mashallah advised starting construction under Leo, associated with fire, productivity, and expansion. Bricks for the city were 18 inches square, and Abu Hanifah supervised their production. A canal supplied water for drinking and construction. Marble was used extensively, including steps leading to the river.\nThe city's layout consisted of two large semicircles, with a 2 km-wide circular core known as the \"Round City.\" It had parks, gardens, villas, and promenades. Unlike European cities of the time, Baghdad had a sanitation system, fountains, and public baths, with thousands of hammams enhancing hygiene. The mosque and guard headquarters stood at the center, though some central space's function remains unknown. Baghdad's circular design reflected ancient Near Eastern urban planning, similar to the Sasanian city of Gur and older Mesopotamian cities like Mari. While Tell Chuera and Tell al-Rawda also provide examples of this type of urban planning existing in Bronze Age Syria. This style of urban planning contrasted with Ancient Greek and Roman urban planning, in which cities are designed as squares or rectangles with streets intersecting each other at right angles.\nBaghdad was lively, with attractions like cabarets, chess halls, live plays, concerts, and acrobatics. Storytelling flourished, with professional storytellers (al-Qaskhun) captivating crowds, inspiring the tales of Arabian Nights. The city had four walls named after major destinations—Kufa, Basra, Khurasan, and Syria; their gates pointed in on these destinations. The gates were 2.4 km apart, with massive iron doors requiring several men to operate. The walls, up to 44 meters thick and 30 meters high, were reinforced with a second wall, towers, and a moat for added defense. On street corners, storytellers engaged crowds with tales such as those later told in Arabian Nights. The Golden Gate Palace, home of the caliph, stood at Baghdad's center with a grand 48-meter green dome. Only the caliph could approach its esplanade on horseback. Nearby were officer residences and a guardhouse. After Caliph Al-Amin's death in 813, the palace ceased to be the caliph's residence.\n\nCenter of learning (8th–9th centuries)\nWithin a generation of its founding, Baghdad became a hub of learning and commerce. The city flourished into an unrivaled intellectual center of science, medicine, philosophy, and education, especially with the Abbasid translation movement began under the second caliph Al-Mansur and thrived under the seventh caliph Al-Ma'mun. Baytul-Hikmah or the \"House of Wisdom\" was among the most well known academies, and had the largest selection of books in the world by the middle of the 9th century. Notable scholars based in Baghdad during this time include translator Hunayn ibn Ishaq, mathematician al-Khwarizmi, and philosopher Al-Kindi.\n\nAlthough Arabic was used as the language of science, the scholarship involved not only Arabs, but also Persians, Syriacs, Nestorians, Jews, Arab Christians, and people from other ethnic and religious groups native to the region. These are considered among the fundamental elements that contributed to the flourishing of scholarship in the Medieval Islamic world. Baghdad was also a significant center of Islamic religious learning, with Al-Jahiz contributing to the formation of Mu'tazili theology, as well as Al-Tabari culminating in the scholarship on the Quranic exegesis. Baghdad is likely to have been the largest city in the world from shortly after its foundation until the 930s, when it tied with Córdoba. Several estimates suggest that the city contained over a million inhabitants at its peak. Many of the One Thousand and One Nights tales, widely known as the Arabian Nights, are set in Baghdad during this period. It would surpass even Constantinople in prosperity and size.\nAmong the notable features of Baghdad during this period were its exceptional libraries. Many of the Abbasid caliphs were patrons of learning and enjoyed collecting both ancient and contemporary literature. Although some of the princes of the previous Umayyad dynasty had begun to gather and translate Greek scientific literature, the Abbasids were the first to foster Greek learning on a large scale. Many of these libraries were private collections intended only for the use of the owners and their immediate friends, but the libraries of the caliphs and other officials soon took on a public or a semi-public character.\n\nFour great libraries were established in Baghdad during this period. The earliest was that of the famous Al-Ma'mun, who was caliph from 813 to 833. Another was established by Sabur ibn Ardashir in 991 or 993 for the literary men and scholars who frequented his academy. This second library was plundered and burned by the Seljuks only seventy years after it was established. This was a good example of the sort of library built up out of the needs and interests of a literary society. The last two were examples of madrasa or theological college libraries. The Nezamiyeh was founded by the Persian Nizam al-Mulk, who was vizier of two early Seljuk sultans. It continued to operate even after the coming of the Mongols in 1258. The Mustansiriyya Madrasa, which owned an exceedingly rich library, was founded by Al-Mustansir, the second last Abbasid caliph, who died in 1242. This would prove to be the last great library built by the caliphs of Baghdad.\n\nStagnation and invasions (10th–16th centuries)\nBy the 10th century, the city's population was between 1.2 million and 2 million. Baghdad's early meteoric growth eventually slowed due to troubles within the Caliphate, including relocations of the capital to Samarra (during 808–819 and 836–892), the loss of the western and easternmost provinces, and periods of political domination by the Iranian Buwayhids (945–1055) and Seljuk Turks (1055–1135). The Seljuks were a clan of the Oghuz Turks from Central Asia that converted to the Sunni branch of Islam. In 1040, they destroyed the Ghaznavids, taking over their land and in 1055, Tughril Beg, the leader of the Seljuks, took over Baghdad. The Seljuks expelled the Buyid dynasty of Shiites that had ruled for some time and took over power and control of Baghdad. They ruled as Sultans in the name of the Abbasid caliphs (they saw themselves as being part of the Abbasid regime). Tughril Beg saw himself as the protector of the Abbasid Caliphs.\n\nBaghdad was captured in 1394, 1534, 1623 and 1638. The city has been sieged in 812, 865, 946, 1157, 1258 and in 1393 and 1401, by Tamerlane. In 1058, Baghdad was captured by the Fatimids under the Turkish general Abu'l-Ḥārith Arslān al-Basasiri, an adherent of the Ismailis along with the 'Uqaylid Quraysh. Not long before the arrival of the Saljuqs in Baghdad, al-Basasiri petitioned to the Fatimid Imam-Caliph al-Mustansir to support him in conquering Baghdad on the Ismaili Imam's behalf. It has recently come to light that the famed Fatimid da'i, al-Mu'ayyad al-Shirazi, had a direct role in supporting al-Basasiri and helped the general to succeed in taking Mawṣil, Wāsit and Kufa. Soon after, by December 1058, a Shi'i adhān (call to prayer) was implemented in Baghdad and a khutbah (sermon) was delivered in the name of the Fatimid Imam-Caliph. Despite his Shi'i inclinations, Al-Basasiri received support from Sunnis and Shi'is alike, for whom opposition to the Saljuq power was a common factor.\n\nOn 10 February 1258, Baghdad was captured by the Mongols led by Hulegu, a grandson of Genghis Khan (Chingiz Khan), during the siege of Baghdad. Many quarters were ruined by fire, siege, or looting. The Mongols massacred most of the city's inhabitants, including the caliph Al-Musta'sim, and destroyed large sections of the city. The canals and dykes forming the city's irrigation system were also destroyed. During this time, in Baghdad, Christians and Shia were tolerated, while Sunnis were treated as enemies. The sack of Baghdad put an end to the Abbasid Caliphate. It has been argued that this marked an end to the Islamic Golden Age and served a blow from which Islamic civilization never fully recovered.\nAt this point, Baghdad was ruled by the Ilkhanate, a breakaway state of the Mongol Empire, ruling from Iran. In August 1393, Baghdad was occupied by the Central Asian Turkic conqueror Timur (\"Tamerlane\"), by marching there in only eight days from Shiraz. Sultan Ahmad Jalayir fled to Syria, where the Mamluk Sultan Barquq protected him and killed Timur's envoys. Timur left the Sarbadar prince Khwaja Mas'ud to govern Baghdad, but he was driven out when Ahmad Jalayir returned.\n\nIn 1401, Baghdad was again sacked, by Timur, a Central Asian Turko-Mongol figure. When his forces took Baghdad, he spared almost no one, and ordered that each of his soldiers bring back two severed human heads. Baghdad became a provincial capital controlled by the Mongol Jalayirid (1400–1411), Turkic Kara Koyunlu (1411–1469), Turkic Ak Koyunlu (1469–1508), and the Iranian Safavid (1508–1534) dynasties.\n\nOttoman and Mamluks (16th–19th centuries)\nThe Safavids took control of the city in 1509 under the leadership of Shah Ismail I. It remained under Safavid rule until the Ottomans seized it in 1535, but the Safavids regained control in 1624. A massacre occurred when the Shah's army entered the city. It remained under Safavid rule until 1639 when Sultan Murad IV recaptured it in 1638.\nIn 1534, Baghdad was captured by the Ottoman Empire, becoming the administrative capital of Ottoman Iraq. Under the Ottomans, Baghdad continued into a period of decline, partially as a result of the enmity between its rulers and Iranian Safavids, which did not accept the Sunni control of the city. Between 1623 and 1638, it returned to Iranian rule before falling back into Ottoman hands. Baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague and cholera, and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out. The city became part of an eyalet and then a vilayet.\nFor a time, Baghdad had been the largest city in the Middle East. The city saw relative revival in the latter part of the 18th century, under Mamluk government. Direct Ottoman rule was reimposed by Ali Rıza Pasha in 1831. From 1851 to 1852 and from 1861 to 1867, Baghdad was governed, under the Ottoman Empire by Mehmed Namık Pasha. The Nuttall Encyclopedia reports the 1907 population of Baghdad as 185,000.\nThe city's municipality was established in 1868, and Ibrahim al-Daftari was appointed its first mayor. The year 1869 is of great importance in the history of Baghdad in the Ottoman era, as it was the beginning of what can be considered a distinct era of the Ottoman eras, the foundations of which were laid by Governor Midhat Pasha, who implemented a number of reform systems and laws that the state legislated during the era of reforms and reconstruction, which was called the Tanzimat era. The overall importance of Baghdad to the Ottomans was that they made the headquarters of the Sixth Corps of the Ottoman Army in the city.\nBy the 19th century, Baghdad emerged as a leading center for Jewish learning. The city had Jewish population of over 6,000 and had numerous yeshivas. The Jewish population has grown so rapidly that by 1884, there were 30,000 Jews in Baghdad and by 1900, around 50,000, comprising over a quarter of the city's total population. Large-scale Jewish immigration from Kurdistan to Baghdad continued throughout this period. By the mid-19th century, the religious infrastructure of Baghdad grew to include a large yeshiva which trained up to sixty rabbis at time. Religious scholarship flourished in Baghdad, which produced great rabbis, such as Joseph Hayyim ben Eliahu Mazal-Tov, known as the Ben Ish Chai (1834–1909) or Rabbi Abdallah Somekh (1813–1889). During this time, Baghdadi Jews established a successful trade diaspora in China, India and Singapore.\n\nModern era\nBaghdad and southern Iraq remained under Ottoman rule until 1918, when they were captured by the British during World War I. In 1920, a revolt erupted in Baghdad against new British policies. It began in summer with mass demonstrations by Iraqis, including protests by embittered officers from the old Ottoman Army. The revolt gained momentum and spread to the middle and lower Euphrates. The British authorities retaliated by air bombing across Baghdad, which killed thousands of residents. In 1921, under the Mandate of Mesopotamia, Baghdad became the capital of the British-protected monarchy. Baghdad was made capital of the independent kingdom of Iraq in 1932.\nSeveral architectural and planning projects were commissioned to reinforce this administration. During this period, the substantial Jewish community (probably exceeding 100,000 people) comprised between a quarter and a third of the city's population. The National Museum of Iraq and the University of Baghdad were built by King Faisal, who laid foundation for the modern Iraqi state. The city's population grew from an estimated 145,000 in 1900 to 580,000 in 1950. A development plan came in 1957, visioned by Frank Lloyd Wright. The plan proposed to build a cultural hub on an island on the river, with an opera house, museums, a university, shopping malls, and a 300-foot statue of the fifth Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid.\nOn 1 April 1941, members of the \"Golden Square\" led by former minister Rashid Ali al-Gaylani staged a coup in Baghdad and installed a pro-German and pro-Italian government to replace the pro-British government of Regent Abd al-Ilah. The British forces intervened in the resulting Anglo-Iraqi War. Fearing the advancement, Gaylani and his government had fled, and the mayor of Baghdad surrendered to the British and Commonwealth forces. On 1–2 June, during the ensuing power vacuum, Jewish residents were attacked following rumors they had aided the British. In what became known as the Farhud, over 180 Jews were killed and 1,000 injured, 900 Jewish homes were destroyed, and hundreds of Jewish properties were ransacked. Many Jewish girls were raped and children maimed in front of their families. Between 300 and 400 non-Jewish rioters were killed in the attempt to quell the violence. Between 1950 and 1951, Jews were targeted in series of bombings. According to Avi Shlaim, Israel was behind bombings.\n\nOn 14 July 1958, a significant portion of the Iraqi Army under Abdul-Karim Qasim, staged a coup to topple the Kingdom of Iraq. The army seized control over Baghdad and stormed the radio station and the Al-Rehab Palace. Many people were brutally killed during the coup, including King Faisal II, former Regent Abd al-Ilah and former Prime Minister Nuri al-Said and members of the royal family. Many of the royal figures' bodies were dragged through the streets and mutilated. Mob violence emerged and several foreign nationals staying at the Baghdad Hotel, including Americans and Jordanians were killed. New principles were adopted for the city's development. New Baghdad and Sadr City were developed during the reign of Qasim. In 1960, Baghdad hosted an international conference with dignitaries from Iran, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, that founded Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).During the 1970s, Baghdad experienced a period of prosperity and growth because of a sharp increase in the price of petroleum, Iraq's main export. New infrastructure including oil pipelines, modern sewerage, and highways were built. Master plans of the city (1967 and 1973) were delivered by the Polish planning office Miastoprojekt-Kraków, mediated by Polservice. Saddam Hussein sponsored architectural and artwork events, that attracted world's popular architects. The city had a vibrant lifestyle. Baghdad was called as \"Nuremberg of 1930s\" and \"Las Vegas of the 1980s\".\nHowever, the Iran–Iraq War of the 1980s was a difficult time for the city, as money was diverted to the military and thousands of residents endured devastations. Iran launched a number of missiles and rockets on Baghdad, some of them hitting dangerously close to Al-Rashid Street and the Jewish Quarter. Power plants and oil refineries were damaged. A nuclear reactor near Baghdad was destroyed in an airstrike by Israel. Despite the war, preparations were underway for Baghdad to host a Non-Alignment Movement summit. Conference centers and hotels such as Palestine Hotel, Al-Mansour Hotel and Ishtar Hotel were built. However, the summit was later shifted to New Delhi, due to deteriorating security.\nDuring the Gulf War, Baghdad was the most heavily defended area of Iraq. Initially, U.S. airstrikes on Baghdad failed and resulted a tactical victory for the Iraqi Air Force. Later, the Coalition forces proceeded with aerial bombings. Air defense, communication systems, bridges, chemical weapon facilities, and artilleries were damaged. Oil refineries and airport were targeted. On 13 February 1991, an aerial bombing attack in Amiriya killed at least 408 civilians. Shortly after the end of the war, ethnic Kurds and Shi'a Muslims led uprisings against the government. Clashes took place Shi'a rebels and the Republican Guard led by Qusay Hussein. Sadr City was besieged until the order restored. Another uprising occurred in 1999, after Ayatollah Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr was assassinated in Najaf. Unrest began as large scale protests took place in Shia neighborhoods of Baghdad, specially Saddam City. The Republican Guard deployed in the district suppressed the demonstration, leaving between 27 and 100 dead.\nBaghdad was targeted in frequent U.S. airstrikes. On 26 June 1993, cruise missiles were launched into downtown Baghdad, targeting the intelligence headquarters in the Mansour district. The attack killed nine civilians nearby, including actress and painter Layla Al-Attar. During the 1998 bombing of Iraq, missiles struck multiple locations across Baghdad, including presidential palaces, several Republican Guard barrakcs, and offices of the Ministry of Defense and the Military industry. On February 16, 2001, the U.S. launched air strikes on five military targets at Taji.\n\n21st century (2001–present)\nThe city was economically drained, as a result of the Gulf War and the subsequent embargo against Iraq. By the end of the 1990s, the government made improvements and began rebuilding Baghdad. Government offices, presidential palaces, bridges and roads damaged in the war and follow-up U.S. attacks were restored. The city's airport was reopened, with flights from Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. Numerous mosques were built as a part of the Faith Campaign. In 2001, a broad initiative came to restore Baghdad's cultural heritage. Older mosques, churches, mandis and synagogues were restored and other historical structures were rebuilt. Under Saddam's architectural vision, a large number of palaces were built around the city. However, these efforts were interrupted by the war which began in 2003.\nIn 2003, the United States-led coalition invaded Iraq. Coalition forces launched massive aerial assaults. The resistance of the Iraqi Army of the city's airport delayed coalition's entry into Baghdad. Following the fall of Baghdad on 9 April 2003, the government lost its power. A statue of Saddam was toppled in Firdous Square, symbolizing the end of his rule. Many of the former government officials were either killed or captured, while others managed to escape and flee. After the overthrow the government, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was formed. CPA's decisions caused a power vacuum. Also two minor riots took place in 2003, on 21 July and 2 October, causing some disturbance in the population. Shortly after the invasion and the fall of the regime, an insurgancy began against the U.S-led rule of Iraq, consisting of former government officers and Islamist groups.\nBombings took place at Jordanian Embassy and Canal Hotel. Religious and ethnic minorities,— Christians, Mandaeans, and Jews, began leaving the city out of fear of being targeted in attacks, as they were subjected to kidnappings, death threats, and violence. The Iraqi Film Archives site was bombed, priceless collection of artifacts in the National Museum was looted, and thousands of ancient manuscripts in the National Library were destroyed. The Haifa Street helicopter incident on 12 September was controversial. On the eve of Ashura on 2 March 2004, one of the deadliest bombing took place in Baghdad, that killed at least 80–100 and injured 200 Shi'a Muslims. In 2005, over 965 people were killed in Al-Aimmah Bridge near Al-Kadhimiya Mosque. Attempts were made to rescue people, specially from the Sunni district of Adhamiyah, which is today seen as a symbol of unity.\nCoinciding the execution of Saddam Hussein in 2006, violence increased during the civil war between Shi'ite militias and Sunni insurgents. Shi'ite militias were Muqtada as-Sadr's Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) and the Iranian-backed Special Groups and among Sunni insurgents, the largest was Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). Sunni insurgents established their bases Mansour, Adhamiyah and Doura. Mansour district borders the Shi'ite populated Kadhimiyah and East Rasheed. Before 2003, it was home to wealthy Sunnis and Ba'athist officials. Hence, when the regime fell, it quickly became a stronghold for the Sunni insurgency. While Shia militias were based in Sadr City, Kadhimiyah, and West Rasheed, with Bab Al-Sharqi becoming stronghold for the Mahdi Army. Later, they also expanded into the surrounding districts of eastern Baghdad. 9 Nissan, Karadah, and Rusafa were dominated by Shias.\nUnder Operation Imposing Law (Operation Fardh al-Qanoon), the coalition forces and post-2003 Iraqi Army successfully defeated Al-Qaeda and targeted Shia militias. By 2009, the level of violence decreased. However, violence continued. The period surrounding Provincial Elections was remarkably peaceful. But Baghdad witnessed an uptick in attacks in early April 2009, when a series of suicide bomb and vehicle-borne improvised explosive device attacks were perpetrated across the capital.  The war and subsequent occupation ended in 2011, that caused huge damage to Baghdad's transportation, power, and sanitary infrastructure. It resulted in massive civilian casualties, whose number is disputed.\nThough the war ended, but an Islamist insurgency lasted until 2013. Baghdad experienced anti-government protests by Sunnis during the Arab Spring. It was followed by another war from 2013 to 2017 and a low-level insurgency from 2017, which included suicide bombings in January 2018 and January 2021. It has been site of clashes between the citizens and the government. The city attracted global media attention on 3 January 2020, when Iranian general Qasem Soleimani was assassinated in a U.S. drone strike near Baghdad Airport.  In December 2015, Baghdad was selected by UNESCO as the first Arab city of the center of literary creativity.\n\nGeography\nThe city is located on a vast plain bisected by the Tigris river. The Tigris splits Baghdad in half, with the eastern half being called \"Risafa\" and the Western half known as \"Karkh\". The land on which the city is built is almost entirely flat and low-lying, being of quaternary alluvial origin due to periodic large flooding of the Tigris river. The Diyala river is a tributary of the Tigris, flowing southeast of the city and bordering its eastern suburbs.\nBaghdad is 529.8 kilometres (329.2 mi) northwest of Basra, 402.9 kilometres (250.4 mi) south of Mosul, 366.8 kilometres (227.9 mi) south of Erbil and 103.8 kilometres (64.5 mi) northeast of Karbala. Located to the south is Mahmoudiyah, which serves as the gateway to Baghdad.\n\nClimate\nBaghdad has a hot desert climate (Köppen BWh), featuring extremely hot, prolonged, dry summers and mild to cool, slightly wet, short winters. In the summer, from June through August, the average maximum temperature is as high as 44 °C (111 °F) and accompanied by sunshine. Rainfall has been recorded on fewer than half a dozen occasions at this time of year and has never exceeded 1 mm (0.04 in). Even at night, temperatures in summer are seldom below 24 °C (75 °F). Baghdad's record highest temperature of 51.8 °C (125.2 °F) was reached on 28 July 2020. Humidity is under 50% in summer, due to Baghdad's distance from both the marshes in southern Iraq and the coasts of the Persian Gulf. Dust storms from the deserts to the west are a normal occurrence during the summer.\nIts winter temperatures are those of a hot desert climate. From December through February, Baghdad has maximum temperatures averaging 16 to 19 °C (61 to 66 °F), with highs possible above 21 °C (70 °F). Lows below freezing occur statistically a couple of times per year.\nAnnual rainfall, almost entirely confined to the period from November through March, averages approximately 150 mm (5.91 in), but has been as high as 338 mm (13.31 in) and as low as 37 mm (1.46 in). On 11 January 2008, light snow fell across Baghdad for the first time in 100 years. Snowfall was again reported on 11 February 2020, with accumulations across the city.\n\nGovernance\nAdministratively, Baghdad Governorate is divided into districts which are further divided into sub-districts. Municipally, the governorate is divided into 9 municipalities, which have responsibility for local issues. Regional services, however, are coordinated and carried out by a mayor who oversees the municipalities. The governorate council is responsible for the governorate-wide policy. These official subdivisions of the city served as administrative centers for the delivery of municipal services but until 2003 had no political function. Beginning in April 2003, the U.S—controlled Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) began the process of creating new functions for these. The process initially focused on the election of neighborhood councils in official neighborhoods, elected by neighborhood caucuses. The CPA convened a series of meetings in each neighborhood to explain local government, to describe the caucus election process and to encourage participants to spread the word and bring friends, relatives and neighbors to subsequent meetings.\nEach neighborhood process ultimately ended with a final meeting where candidates for the new neighborhood councils identified themselves and asked their neighbors to vote for them. Once all 88 neighborhood councils were in place, each neighborhood council elected representatives from among their members to serve on one of the city's nine district councils. The number of neighborhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighborhood's population. The next step was to have each of the nine district councils elect representatives from their membership to serve on the 37 member Baghdad City Council. Later, the number of official neighborhoods were increased to 89. This three tier system of local government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighborhood, through the district, and up to the city council. The same process was used to provide representative councils for the other communities in Baghdad Province outside of the city itself. There, local councils were elected from 20 neighborhoods (Nahia) and these councils elected representatives from their members to serve on six district councils (Qada).\nAs within the city, the district councils then elected representatives from among their members to serve on the 35 member Baghdad Regional Council. The first step in the establishment of the system of local government for Baghdad Province was the election of the Baghdad Provincial Council. As before, the representatives to the Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils in numbers proportional to the population of the districts they represent. The 41 member Provincial Council took office in February 2004 and served until national elections held in January 2005, when a new Provincial Council was elected. This system of 127 separate councils may seem overly cumbersome; however, Baghdad Province is home to approximately seven million people. At the lowest level, the neighborhood councils, each council represents an average of 75,000 people. The nine District Advisory Councils (DAC) are as follows:\n\nThe nine districts are subdivided into 89 smaller neighborhoods which may make up sectors of any of the districts above. The following is a selection (rather than a complete list) of these neighborhoods:\n\nNotable streets\nHaifa Street\nHilla Road – Runs from the north into Baghdad via Yarmouk (Baghdad)\nCaliphs Street – site of historical mosques and churches\nAl-Sa'doun Street – stretching from Liberation Square to Masbah\nAbu Nuwas Street – runs along the Tigris from the Jumhouriya Bridge to 14 July Suspended Bridge\nDamascus Street – goes from Damascus Square to the Baghdad Airport Road\nMutanabbi Street – A street with numerous bookshops, named after the 10th century Iraqi poet Al-Mutanabbi\nRabia Street\n14 July Street (Mosul Road)\nMuthana al-Shaibani Street\nBor Saeed (Port Said) Street\nThawra Street\nAl-Qanat Street – runs through Baghdad north-south\nAl-Khat al-Sare'a – Mohammed al-Qasim (high speed lane) – runs through Baghdad, north–south\nIndustry Street runs by the University of Technology – center of the computer trade in Baghdad\nAl Nidhal Street\nAl-Rasheed Street – city center Baghdad\nAl-Jumhuriya Street – city center Baghdad\nFalastin Street\nTariq al-Muaskar – (Al-Rasheed Camp Road)\nAkhrot street\nBaghdad Airport Road\n\nDemographics\nBaghdad's population was estimated at 7.22 million in 2015. The surrounding metropolitan region's population is estimated to be 10,500,000. It is second largest city in the Arab world after Cairo and fourth largest metropolitan area in the Middle East after Tehran. At the beginning of the 21st century, some 1.5 million people migrated to Baghdad. The 2013–2017 civil war following the Islamic State's invasion in 2014 caused hundreds of thousands of Iraqi internally displaced people to flee to the city.\n\nEthnicity\nThe vast majority of Baghdad's ethnic population are Iraqi Arabs, while minority groups include Kurds, Feyli, Kurdish, Turkmen, Assyrians, Kawliya, Circassians, Mandaeans, and Armenians. Post-2003 have left an impact of Baghdad's ethnic composition. In 2003, approximately 500,000 Kurds lived in Baghdad. As of 2016, around 300,000 remained in Baghdad. Among them, about 150,000 are Shi'a mostly of Luri origin. The main Kurdish neighborhood is situated in central Baghdad, known as the Quarter of Kurds (Akd al–Akrad). It is itself home to more than 200 Kurdish families that have lived for generations.\nChristians in Baghdad are predominantly ethnic Assyrians and Armenians. Assyrians began moving to Baghdad by the mid 20th century from northern Iraq and Iran. The historic \"Assyrian Quarter\" of the city – Dora, which boasted a population of 150,000 Assyrians in 2003, made up over 3% of the capital's Assyrian population then.  The community has been subject to kidnappings, death threats, vandalism, and house burnings by al-Qaeda and other insurgent groups. As of the end of 2014, only 1,500 Assyrians remained in Dora and others in Karrada district. Before the war, 25,000 Armenians lived in Iraq, with majority them concentrated in Baghdad. Although the Armenian population has reduced, Baghdad is still home to the largest community of Armenians in Iraq, primarily concentrated in the Armenian quarter of Bab al-Sharqi area.\nAn estimated 60,000 Iraqi Turkmen live in Baghdad, with significant population in the neighborhoods of Adhamiyah and Ragheba Khatun. There is a Circassian neighborhood in the city, which is home to the largest Circassian community of Iraq. The metropolitan area and the adjoining governorate is also home to Kawliya, African Iraqis,  Chechens and other groups.\n\nReligion\nThe majority of the citizens are Muslims with minorities of Christians, Yezidis, Jews and Mandeans also present. There are many religious centers distributed around the city including mosques, churches, synagogues and Mashkhannas cultic huts. The city historically has a predominantly Sunni population, but by the early 21st century around 52% of the city's population were Shi'ites. Sunni Muslims make up 29–34% of Iraq's population and they are still a majority in west and north Iraq. As early as 2003, about 20% of the population of the city was the result of mixed marriages between Shi'ites and Sunnis. Following the civil war between Sunni and Shia militia groups during the occupation of Iraq, the population of Sunnis significantly decreased as they were pushed out of many neighborhoods. Today majority of the neighborhoods are either entirely Sunni or Shi'ite. While few localities are mixed, such as Yarmouk.\nThe Christian community in Baghdad is divided among various denominations, mainly the Chaldean Catholic Church and the Syriac Catholic Church. There is also a significant presence of followers of the Assyrian Church of the East and the Syriac Orthodox Church, along with the largest Armenian Apostolic and Protestant communities in Iraq, which is also located in Baghdad. The city serves as the headquarters of the Chaldean Catholic Church, with its see located in the Cathedral of Our Lady of Sorrows, while the Ancient Church of the East has its see in the Cathedral of the Virgin. Before the Iraq War in 2003, Baghdad was home to 300,000–800,000 Christians, primarily concentrated in several neighborhoods with a Christian majority or significant minority, the most notable being Karrada and al–Dora, which had around 150,000 Christians. After 2003, a large number of Christians were displaced in wars and many of them fled to Baghdad after ISIS's takeover of Mosul. Today about 100,000 Christians remained in Baghdad, primarily in Karrada and Mansour district.\nBaghdad was once home to one of the world's most significant Jewish communities. In 1948, Jews numbered approximately 150,000, constituting 33% of the city's population. Persecution forced most Jews to flee Iraq. Even after 1948, up to 100,000 Jews remained, which decreased. Majority of 15,000 Iraqi Jews lived in Baghdad during Saddam Hussein's rule and their population dwindled, not due to persecution but because of lifted travel restrictions that allowed many to emigrate. By 2003, Iraq still had a Jewish community of about 1,500 people, majority of whom resided in Baghdad. But the population decreased sharply after the war. Today, an estimated 160 Jews live in Baghdad out of spotlight, primarily in the old Jewish quarters of Bataween and Shorja, which was once home to vibrant Jewish community. The city was historically home to over 60 synagogues, cemeteries, and shrines, many of which were preserved before 2003. However, their condition deteriorated after the war, and only a few sites, such as the Meir Taweig Synagogue and Al-Habibiyah Jewish Cemetery, remain today.\n\nBeyond their traditional homelands, around Amarah and Basra, Mandaeans are also found in Baghdad. By the late 20th century, Mandaeans began settling in Baghdad for better opportunities. Most of them live primarily around al-Qadisiyah and Dora, which is location to their place of worship and cultural centers. However, persecution of Mandaeans have been greatly decreased since 2003.  There is also a small of community of Baha'is and Sikhs, who live in Baghdad. The Sikhs are mostly Indians. Before 2003, Baghdad was regularly visited by Sikh pilgrims from India.\n\nEconomy\nBaghdad serves as the commercial and financial hub, home to 22% of the population, and generating 40% of the Iraq's GDP. It connects trade routes between Turkey, Syria, India, and Southeast Asia. As the capital, it hosts government institutions and state enterprises, key sources of employment. The public education system follows Ba'athist socialist ideologies, for employment in the public sector. Since 2003, the public sector has struggled to provide jobs, and the private sector hasn't grown sufficiently, leading companies to hire mainly foreigners. To address this, NGOs are establishing incubation centers in the city.\nBaghdad serves as headquarters for important companies of Iraq, such as Iraq National Oil Company, State Organization for Marketing of Oil and Iraqi Airways. Baghdad is home to large insurance companies and banks — Central Bank of Iraq, Rafidain Bank, and Rashid Bank and regional headquarters for First Abu Dhabi Bank, Fransabank and Saudi National Bank. Multinational companies such as Honeywell, Shell, General Electric, SalamAir and Robert Bosch GmbH have established their regional base. Baghdad is also home to Iraq Stock Exchange, that was established in 1992. Most of these establishments are located in Al-Rasheed Street, Karrada and Mansour district.\nIt was once one of the main destinations in the region with a wealth of cultural attractions. Tourism has diminished due to wars, but in recent years the city has a revival in tourism although still facing challenges. There are numerous historic, scientific and artistic museums in Baghdad. Religious tourism in Baghdad has grown since 2003, with sites like Al-Kadhimiya Mosque, Abu Hanifa Mosque, Mausoleum of Abdul-Qadir Gilani, and Buratha Mosque attracting visitors from Iran, Pakistan, and India, while non-religious tourists mainly come from Turkey, France, and the United States. Around 1 million people visit the city annually for religious purposes. The pilgrims are both Shia and Sunni Muslims.\nThe city contains the factories of carpets, leather and textiles, workshops, cement and tobacco factories. Industrial areas extend from the city center to outside and suburbs in the metropolitan area, such as Taji and northern Baghdad. Subsequently, it has produced a wide variety of consumer and industrial goods, including processed foods and beverages, clothes, footwear, wood products, furniture, paper and printed material, bricks, chemicals, plastics, electrical equipment, and metal and nonmetallic products. Bismayah, southeast of Baghdad, is home to world's largest precast factory. In agricultural aspect, palm groves are spread in the city, and many of its people depends on the cultivation of many yields.\nBaghdad, like other provinces such as Babylon, Karbala and Qadissiya, contains metals such as aluminum, ceramics, nickel, manganese and chromium, whose size is not yet known, being recently discovered by local Iraqi cadres lacking experience and mechanisms to determine the size of these explorations. An oilfield is located in eastern Baghdad. It was believed that the quantities of oil is modest, but the drilling disclosed that its size exceeds the initial estimates, and has northern extensions in the province of Salah al-Din, and southern province of Wasit. The city is also home to Dora Refinery, a large oil refinery in Dora, which is the 3rd largest in Iraq in terms of production. The production of it exceeds 200,000 barrels (32,000 m3) per day, while its total production estimated if it was developed up to 120,000 barrels (19,000 m3) per day.\nMost reconstruction efforts have been devoted to the restoration and repair of badly damaged urban infrastructure. Some of the private projects includes  Baghdad Renaissance Plan, Sindbad Hotel Complex and Conference Center, and Central Bank of Iraq Tower. Other project proposed includes Romantic Island and Baghdad Gate. Numerous projects have been also impacted due to corruption. According to a report published by CNBC, there are around 150 entertainment projects planned for the city. Many of them were delayed due to government policies. Also Baghdad has witnessed the opening of dozens of tourist complexes annually with areas reaching 20,000 square metres (4.9 acres) in addition to some major tourism projects with areas exceeding 50,000 square metres (12 acres) with the aim of investment combining trade and tourism as a distinctive economic model. In recent years, Baghdad has also adopted modern economic trends like, establishment of startup hubs, office space and incubation center, as well as development of shopping malls such Baghdad Mall and Dijlah Village.\n\nTransportation\nBaghdad lacks substantial public transportation, and taxis are the primary means of transportation in the city. Roads in Baghdad have been known to be especially congested since at least 2003. According to MP Jassim Al-Bukhati in 2021, \"Baghdad's roads are designed to accommodate 700,000 cars, while now there are between 2.5 and 3 million cars on them\". This is because, since 2003, car imports have increased. Since then, river-based water transport has become a popular mode of transport. Use of boats crossing across the river saves time for travelers escaping congestion. Private organizations are working to improve the transport system.\nAmong the major bridges connecting Karkh and Rusafa are 14th of July Bridge, Al-Aimmah Bridge and Al-Sarafiya Bridge. In 2023, the authorities announced plans to build 19 bridges in Baghdad. This is a part of its post-war reconstruction efforts, as many bridges were damaged during the war. Streets, avenues and alleys form an important part of the transport network. Al-Sa'doun Street stretches from Liberation Square to Masbah. Abu Nuwas Street runs along the Tigris from the Jumhouriya Bridge to 14 July Suspended Bridge. Damascus Street goes from Damascus Square to the Baghdad Airport Road. Hilla Road runs from the north into Baghdad via Yarmouk. Mutanabbi Street is a street with numerous bookshops, named after the 10th century Iraqi poet Al-Mutanabbi. Caliphs Street is the site of historical mosques and churches.\n\nAir transport\nIraqi Airways, the national airline of Iraq, operates out of Baghdad International Airport in Baghdad. The airport was opened by Saddam Hussein in 1982 as Saddam International Airport. It was closed as result of the Gulf War and subsequent embargo. The airport was reopened in August 2000. The airport adopted its current name after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nPlanned Baghdad Metro\nThe Baghdad Metro project was first proposed during the 1970s but did not come to fruition due to wars and sanctions. After the Iraq war, Iraqi authorities intended to revive the project, but it was again delayed due to domestic instability. In 2019, it was reported that Korean Hyundai and French Alstom would be building the metro. However, the planned construction did not happen.\nAs of February 2024, the current plan consisted of fully electric and automated (driverless) trains running on an extensive railway network including an underground railway portion as well as an elevated railway. The proposed Baghdad Metro system includes seven main lines with a total length of more than 148 kilometres, 64 metro stations, four workshops and depots for trains, several operations control centers (OCC) and seven main power stations (MPS) with a capacity of 250 mega-watts, and several Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) towers. The metro will be equipped with CCTV and internet as well as USB ports for charging. Special compartments will be allocated for women and children as well as seats for people with special needs, pregnant women, and the elderly. The metro stations will be connected to other public transport networks such as buses and taxis, and 10 parking spaces will be available for commuters. The planned operating speed will be 80–140 km/hour with an estimated 3.25 million riders per day.\nIn July 2024, it was announced that an international consortium of German French, Spanish, and Turkish companies was awarded $17.5 billion contract to construct Baghdad's metro. The consortium includes Alstom, Systra, SNCF, Talgo, Deutsche Bank and SENER. The consortium was then to negotiate the technical, financial and operational details of the project which is now estimated to be completed in May 2029.\n\nCityscape\nThe Round City was the core of the city, during the establishment of Baghdad. It ceased to exist, as a result of the Mongolian siege. Urban features such as streets, avenues, alleyways and squares clusters a large number of landmarks, which itself creates an identity of cultural or intellectual hubs and define the beauty of Baghdad.\nAl-Rasheed Street is one of the most significant landmarks in Baghdad. Located in al-Rusafa area, the street was an artistic, intellectual and cultural center for many Baghdadis. It also included many prominent theaters and nightclubs such as the Crescent Theatre where Egyptian Singer Umm Kulthum sang during her visit in 1932 as well as the Chakmakji Company that recorded the music of various Arab singers. The street also contains famous and well-known landmarks including the ancient Haydar-Khana Mosque as well as numerous well-known cafés such as al-Zahawi Café and the Brazilian Café.\nMutanabbi Street is located near the old quarter of Baghdad; at Al-Rasheed Street. It is the historic center of Baghdadi book-selling, a street filled with bookstores and outdoor book stalls. It was named after the 10th-century classical Iraqi poet Al-Mutanabbi. This street is well established for bookselling and has often been referred to as the heart and soul of the Baghdad literacy and intellectual community. Firdos Square is a public open space in Baghdad and the location of two of the best-known hotels, the Palestine Hotel and the Sheraton Ishtar, which are both also the tallest buildings in Baghdad. The square was the site of the statue of Saddam Hussein that was pulled down by the coalition forces in a widely televised event during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nQushla or Qishla is a public square and the historical complex located in al-Rusafa neighborhood at the riverbank of Tigris. The place and its surroundings is where the historical features and cultural capitals of Baghdad are concentrated, from the Mutanabbi Street, Abbasid-era palace and bridges, Ottoman-era mosques to the Mustansariyah Madrasa. The square developed during the Ottoman era as a military barracks. Today, it is a place where the citizens of Baghdad find leisure such as reading poetry in gazebos. It is characterized by the iconic clock tower which was donated by George V. The entire area is submitted to the UNESCO World Heritage Site Tentative list.\n\nArchitecture\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Saddam Hussein's government spent a lot of money on new monuments, mosques, palaces and hotels. The Street is also notable for its architecture and aesthetic which was inspired by Renaissance architecture and also includes the famous Iraqi shanasheel.\n\nModern Landmarks\nThe National Museum of Iraq whose collection of artifacts was looted during the invasion, and the iconic Hands of Victory arches. Multiple political parties are in discussions as to whether the arches should remain as historical monuments or be dismantled. Thousands of ancient manuscripts in the National Library were destroyed under Saddam's command.\nGrand Festivities Square is the main square where public celebrations are held and is also the home to three important monuments commemorating Iraqi's fallen soldiers and victories in war; namely Al-Shaheed Monument, the Victory Arch and the Unknown Soldier's Monument. Al-Shaheed Monument, also known as the Martyr's Memorial, is a monument dedicated to the Iraqi soldiers who died in the Iran–Iraq War. However, now it is generally considered by Iraqis to be for all of the martyrs of Iraq, especially those allied with Iran and Syria fighting ISIS, not just of the Iran–Iraq War. The monument was opened in 1983, and was designed by the Iraqi architect Saman Kamal and the Iraqi sculptor and artist Ismail Fatah Al Turk. Though these works symbolize the ruling entity. Neverthelsess, they have remained part of architectural legacy, which beautified Baghdad.\nMasjid Al-Kadhimain is a shrine that is located in the Kādhimayn suburb of Baghdad. It contains the tombs of the seventh and ninth Twelver Shi'ite Imams, Musa al-Kadhim and Muhammad at-Taqi respectively, upon whom the title of Kādhimayn (\"Two who swallow their anger\") was bestowed. Many Shi'ites travel to the mosque from far away places to commemorate those imams. A'dhamiyyah is a predominantly Sunni area with a Mosque that is associated with the Sunni Imam Abu Hanifa. The name of Al-Aʿẓamiyyah is derived from Abu Hanifa's title, al-Imām al-Aʿẓam (the Great Imam).\nThe historic Jewish quarters of Bataween and Shorja is home to numerous sites that are associated with Jews. These sites were preserved during the Ba'athist regime. However, after 2003, many of them are in poor conditions. Meir Taweig Synagogue is the only active synagogue of Iraq, which have a large compound, that consist of community center, Jewish school and library. Daniel Market (Souq Danial), which was named after Menahem Saleh Daniel, still bears the same name. It is popular for fabrics and shoes. The Great Synagogue of Baghdad, the oldest synagogue of Iraq, is now restored as a museum. Al-Habibiyah Cemetery is the largest Jewish cemetery in Baghdad, home to around 1,000 graves. The Tomb of Joshua, now a Muslim shrine, is believed to be the burial site of Joshua. Shaykh Yitzhak Tomb and Synagogue was preserved until 2003. Today it is neglected. Other sites includes House of Sassoon Eskell and library of Mir Basri.\nThe Sabian–Mandaean Mandi of Baghdad is a Mandaen temple in al-Qadisiyyah. It is the main community center for Mandaeans in Iraq. Plans are underway to demolish and build a larger one to accommodate more worshippers. A cultural institute for Mandeans is also in Baghdad. The city is home to Baba Nanak Shrine, a sacred site in Sikhism. It was destroyed during the Iraq War in 2003. In the Kadhimiya district of Baghdad, was the house of Baháʼu'lláh, (Prophet Founder of the Baha'i Faith) also known as the \"Most Great House\" (Bayt-i-Aʻzam) and the \"House of God\", where Baháʼu'lláh mostly resided from 1853 to 1863. It is considered a holy place and a place of pilgrimage by Baha'is according to their \"Most Holy Book\". On 23 June 2013, the house was destroyed under unclear circumstances.\n\nBaghdad Zoo used to be the largest zoological park in the Middle East. Within eight days following the 2003 invasion, however, only 35 of the 650 animals in the facility survived. This was a result of theft of some animals for human food, and starvation of caged animals that had no food. Conservationist Lawrence Anthony and some of the zoo keepers cared for the animals and fed the carnivores with donkeys they had bought locally. Eventually Paul Bremer, Director of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq after the invasion, ordered protection for the zoo and enlisted U.S. engineers to help reopen the facility. Al-Zawraa Park is also part of the zoo, which is main urban park of the city.\n\nEducation\nThe House of Wisdom was a major academy and public center in Baghdad. The Mustansiriya Madrasa was established in 1227 by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mustansir. The name was changed to al-Mustansiriya University in 1963. The University of Baghdad is the largest university in Iraq and the second largest in the Arab world. Prior to the Gulf War, multiple international schools operated in Baghdad, including:\n\nÉcole française de Bagdad\nDeutsche Schule Bagdad\nBaghdad Japanese School (バグダッド日本人学校), a nihonjin gakko\n\nUniversities\nUniversity of Baghdad\nMustansiriya University\nIraqi University\nNahrain University\nAlbayan University\nUniversity of Technology\nAmerican University of Iraq - Baghdad\nAl-Turath University College\nDijlah University College\n\nCulture\nBaghdad has always played a significant role in the broader Arab cultural sphere, contributing several significant writers, musicians and visual artists. Historically, the city had a vibrant modern culture and lifestyle. Famous Arab poets and singers such as Nizar Qabbani, Umm Kulthum, Fairuz, Salah Al-Hamdani, Ilham al-Madfai and others have performed for the city. The dialect of Arabic spoken in Baghdad today differs from that of other large urban centers in Iraq, having features more characteristic of nomadic Arabic dialects (Versteegh, The Arabic Language). It is possible that this was caused by the repopulating of the city with rural residents after the multiple sackings of the late Middle Ages. For poetry written about Baghdad, see Reuven Snir (ed.), Baghdad: The City in Verse (Harvard, 2013). Baghdad joined the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature in December 2015.\nSome of the important cultural institutions in the city include the National Theater, which was looted during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, but efforts are underway to restore the theater. The live theater industry received a boost during the 1990s, when UN sanctions limited the import of foreign films. As many as 30 movie theaters were reported to have been converted to live stages, producing a wide range of comedies and dramatic productions. Institutions offering cultural education in Baghdad include The Music and Ballet School of Baghdad and the Institute of Fine Arts Baghdad. The Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra is a government funded symphony orchestra in Baghdad. The INSO plays primarily classical European music, as well as original compositions based on Iraqi and Arab instruments and music. Mandaeans had cultural club in Al-Zawraa, where poetry evenings and cultural seminars were held, attended by poets, writers, artists, officials, and dignitaries of the communities. There is also a social cultural center of Mandaeans at al-Qadisiyyah. Baghdad Jewish Community Center is located in Al-Rashid Street.\nBaghdad is also home to a number of museums which housed artifacts and relics of ancient civilization; many of these were stolen, and the museums looted, during the widespread chaos immediately after United States forces entered the city.\nDuring occupation of Iraq, AFN Iraq (\"Freedom Radio\") broadcast news and entertainment within Baghdad, among other locations. There is also a private radio station called \"Dijlah\" (named after the Arabic word for the Tigris River) that was created in 2004 as Iraq's first independent talk radio station. Radio Dijlah offices, in the Jamia neighborhood of Baghdad, have been attacked on several occasions.\n\nSport\nBaghdad is home to some of the most successful football (soccer) teams in Iraq, the biggest being Al-Shorta (Police), Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya (Air Force), Al-Zawraa, and Al-Talaba (Students). The largest stadium in Baghdad is Al-Shaab Stadium, which was opened in 1966. In recent years, the capital has seen the building of several football stadiums which are meant be opened in near future. The city has also had a strong tradition of horse racing ever since World War I, known to Baghdadis simply as 'Races'. There are reports of pressures by the Islamists to stop this tradition due to the associated gambling.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nCairo, Egypt\n Baku, Azerbaijan\n Pyongyang, North Korea\n Tehran, Iran\n Amman, Jordan\n Damascus, Syria\n Beirut, Lebanon\n Jerusalem (East), Palestine\n Bucharest, Romania\n\nSee also\nIraqi art\nList of mosques in Baghdad\nList of places in Iraq\nHistory of the Jews in Baghdad\nBattle of Baghdad (2003)\nBaghdad Ziyarat Tour\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nDefrémery, C.; Sanguinetti, B.

      "summary": "Baghdad is the capital and largest city in Iraq. It is located on the banks of the Tigris in central Iraq. The city has an estimated population of 8 million. It ranks among the most populous and largest cities in the Middle East and the Arab world and constitutes 22% of the country's population. Baghdad is a primary financial and commercial center in the region.\nFounded in 762 AD by Al-Mansur, Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate and became its most notable development project. The city evolved into an intellectual and cultural center. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the House of Wisdom, as well as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious environment, garnered it a worldwide reputation as the \"Center of Learning\". For much of the Abbasid era, during the Islamic Golden Age, Baghdad was one of the largest cities in the world and rivaled Chang'an, as the population peaked at more than one million. It was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues, shift in power and multiple successive empires. Later, Baghdad served as the administrative center of Ottoman Iraq, exercising authority over the provinces of Basra, Mosul, and Shahrizor.\nDuring the First World War, Baghdad was made the capital of Mandatory Iraq. With the recognition of Iraq as an independent monarchy in 1932, it gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of Arab culture. During the Ba'ath Party rule, the city experienced a period of relative prosperity and growth. However, it faced severe infrastructural damage due to the Iraq War, which began with the invasion of Iraq in 2003, resulting in a substantial loss of cultural heritage and historical artifacts. During the insurgency and renewed war from 2013 to 2017, it had one of the highest rates of terrorist attacks in the world. However, these attacks have gradually declined since the territorial defeat of the Islamic State militant group in Iraq in 2017, and are now rare. Since the end of the war, numerous reconstruction projects have been underway to induce stability.\nIraq's largest city, Baghdad is the seat of government. It generates 40% of the economy of Iraq. A major center of Islamic history, Baghdad is home to numerous historic mosques, as well as churches, mandis and synagogues, highlighting the city's historical diversity. Religious sites such as Masjid al-Kadhimayn, Buratha Mosque, the Shrine of Abdul-Qadir Gilani and Abu Hanifa Mosque are visited by millions of people annually. It was once home to a large Jewish community and was regularly visited by Sikh pilgrims from India. Baghdad is a regional cultural hub. The city is well known for its coffeehouses.",

      "content": "بَغْدَاد هيَ عَاصِمَه جُمْهُوريَّه العِرَاق، ومَرْكَزُ محافظه بَغْدَاد. في عام 2016 بلغَ عَددُ سُكانها حَوالي 8.5 مَليون نَسَمه، مَا يَجعَلها اكبر مَدِينه في العِرَاق وثانِي اكبر مَدِينه في الوَطَنِ العَرَبي بَعْد القَاهِرهِ. وتاتي بالمَرتبه 40 عالميًا من حيث عدد السكان. وتُعد المَدِينه المَركز الاقْتِصَاديّ والادَاريّ والتَعليمِيّ في الدَّوْلَه.\nبناها الخليفه العباسي ابو جعفر المنصور في القرن الثامن الميلادي واتخذها عاصمهً للدوله العباسيه؛ اصبح لبغداد بعدها مكانه عظيمه، فكانت اهم مراكز العلم على تنوعه في العالم وملتقى للعلماء والدارسين لعده قرون من الزمن. وتمثل بغداد حاليًا حالهً من حالات التتابع المدني في اطار موقع واحد، ففي اطار موقع الرافدين تتابعت العواصم من بابل القديمه الى سلوقيه الاغريقيه وطيسفون الفارسيه، التي كانت تعرف بمدائن كسرى، ثم بغداد العربيه الحاليه.\nكانت بغداد اكبر مدينه في العالم لمُعظم فَتره حُكْم بَنو العَباس خلال العصر الذهبي الاسلامي، بِحَيث بلغَ عَدد سُكانها اكثر من مِليون نَسمه. وصلت مدينه بغداد لذروتها في عصر الخليفه العباسي الخامس هارون الرشيد وارتبطت باسمه في روايات الف ليله وليله ذات الشهره العالميه، حيث باتت عاصمه العالم القديم. وقد فقدت هذه المكانه منذ عام 1258 عندما غزاها المغول والتتار. مع حلول بدايات القرن السادس عشر، تبادل الصفويون والعثمانيون السيطره على المدينه، حتى انتزعها العثمانيون اخيراً في عام 1535، فظلت تحت حكمهم قرابه 4 قرون. وفي عام 1917، سيطر الانجليز على المدينه، وقد خضعت كمعظم مناطق العراق الاخرى تحت الانتداب البريطاني، ثم اصبحت عاصمه للمملكه العراقيه عام 1921، والجمهوريه العراقيه عام 1958.\nتكمن اهميه موقع بغداد الجغرافي في توافر المياه وتناقص اخطار الفيضانات، ما ادى بدوره الى اتساع رقعه المدينه وزياده نفوذها الى جانب سهوله اتصالها عبر نهر دجله بواسطه الجسور التي تربطها عبر جوانب النهر، والذي يخترق مركزها لينصفه الى جُزْاَين هما الكرخ والرصافه. وتتشكل المدينه اليوم من 27 منطقه، تنقسم بدورها الى عده احياء.\nتمتاز بغداد باهميتها الثقافيه التي تتمثل بوجود عدد كبير من الصروح المهمه كالمتاحف والمدارس التاريخيه والمكتبات والمسارح. وتشتهر المدينه باثارها الاسلاميه التي تتمثل ببقايا اسوار مدينه بغداد، ودار الخلافه، والمدرسه المستنصريه. ولبغداد القديمه اسماء عده كالمدينه المدوره والزوراء ودار السلام.\n\nالتاريخ\nاظهرت التنقيبات الاثريه ان بغداد كانت في الفترات القديمه موطنًا بشريًا مهما يعود الى العصر الاشوري قبل اختيارها لتكون عاصمه للخلافه العباسيه. ومما جعل لهذا الموقع اهميته الجغرافيه والاستراتيجيه توسطه مدنًا حضاريه انسانيه كبرى تمتد من شمال العراق الى جنوبه. ان هذا الموقع الجغرافي التاريخي جعل بغداد تتبوا موقعًا متوسطًا بين تلك المدن الامر الذي شكل بيئه ملائمه لتطور الانسان وانجازاته الحضاريه والفكريه. وفي العصور التي سبقت الفتح الاسلامي وما بعده، كانت المنطقه التي عرفت في بغداد في العهد العباسي تحيط بها مدن لها اهميتها الاستراتيجيه والجغرافيه. وتقع مدينه بغداد شمال موقع مدينه بابل الاثريه، اضافهً الى انها تقع على بعد بضعه كيلومترات شمال غرب مدينه قطيسفون (المدائن) التي بناها الاغريق قبل الميلاد وورثها الفرس، والتي استمرت كمركز رئيس للبلاد حتى حلت محلها بغداد في القرن الثامن.\n\nبُنيت بغداد في العصر العباسي بين عاميّ 762 و 764 م. واُطلق عليها في القديم اسم الزوراء، ومدينه السلام، وكانت ذات يوم عاصمه الدنيا، ومركز الخلافه الاسلاميه العباسيه. بناها الخليفه العباسي ابو جعفر المنصور، وسماها مدينه المنصور، وجعل لها اربعهُ ابواب هي: باب خُراسان، (وكان يسمى باب الدوله)، وبابُ الشام، ثم بابُ الكوفهِ، ثم باب البصره. وكان المنصور قد اختار لها هذه البقعه من الارض على ضفتي نهر دجله. تزخرُ بغدادُ بالكثيرِ من المعالمِ التاريخيه والحضاريه، اهمها المدرسه المستنصريه، والمساجد الاسلاميه القديمه، والقصور الاثريه، وبها عدد من المقامات الدينيه، اهمها مقاما الامامين موسى الكاظم ومحمد الجواد بالكاظميه، ومقام ابي حنيفه النعمان، ومقام الشيخ عبد القادر الجيلاني وجامع الخلفاء العباسي المعروف قديمًا بجامع القصر او جامع الخليفه، وجامع الحيدرخانه وهو من اتقنِ جوامع بغداد صِنعه واحكامًا\nيوجد بالمدينه متاحف تعرض فيه الاثار المختلفه من جواهر وعملات وهياكل بشريه وتماثيل من عصور ما قبل التاريخ حتى القرن السابع عشر الميلادي.\n\nالعصر العباسي\nكان سبب بناء بغداد في العصر العباسي، ان ابو جعفر المنصور بنى الهاشميه قباله مدينه ابن هبيره بينهما عرض الطريق، وكانت مدينه ابن هبيره التي بحيالها مدينه ابي جعفر الهاشميه الى جانب الكوفه، وبنى المنصور ايضاً مدينه بظهر الكوفه سماها الرصافه. فلما ثارت الراونديه بابي جعفر في مدينته التي تسمى الهاشميه، كره سكناها لاضطراب من اضطرب امره عليه من الراونديه مع قرب جواره من الكوفه ولم يامن اهلها على نفسه فاراد ان يبعد من جوارهم فذكر انه خرج بنفسه يرتاد لها موضعاً يتخذه مسكناً لنفسه وجنده ويبتني به مدينه فبدا فانحدر الى جرجرايا ثم صار الى بغداد ثم مضى الى الموصل ثم عاد الى بغداد فقال هذا موضع معسكر صالح هذه دجله ليس بيننا وبين الصين شيء ياتينا فيها كل ما في البحر وتاتينا الميره من الجزيره وارمينيا وما حول ذلك وهذا الفرات يجيء فيه كل شيء من الشام والرقه وما حول ذلك فنزل وضرب عسكره على الصراه وخط المدينه ووكل بكل ربع قائدًا.\nاختار ابو جعفر المنصور موقع بغداد على رقعه مرتفعه من الارض على الجانب الغربي من نهر دجله عند مصب نهر الرفيل فيه والتي بدا العمل في بنائها بتاريخ الثالث والعشرين من تموز من عام سبعمئه واثنان وستين ميلاديه. وكانت تحيط بهذا الموقع قرى ماهوله السكان مزدهره اهمها: بغداد الباليه القديمه، وسونيا الاراميه، والخطابيه، وشرفانيه، وبناورا، وورثاه، وبراثا، وقطغتا، والوردانيه. وكان هناك جسر على دجله، و دير للنصارى. وكانت الارض التي تحيطها سهله زراعيه تسقيها مياه ترع تتفرع من نهر الرفيل الواسع الذي ياخذ من نهر الفرات ويبعد عن بغداد نحو 30 كيلومترا، ومن نهر الدجيل الذي ياخذ مياهه من دجله في شماليها. وهذه الاراضي المزروعه كانت واسعه تنتج محاصيل زراعيه وافره، ويقابلها في شرقي دجله اراض منبسطه ايضاً تروي مزارعها انهار وترع عده.\nمن جهه اخرى، ذُكر عن عيسى بن المنصور انه قال: \"وجدت في خزائن ابي المنصور في الكتب انه انفق على مدينه السلام وجامعها وقصر الذهب بها والاسواق والفصلان والخنادق وقبابها وابوابها اربعه الاف الف وثمانمئه وثلاثين درهماً ومبلغها من الفلوس مئه الف الف فلس وثلاثه وعشرون الف فلس وذلك ان الاستاذ من البنائين كان يعمل يومه بقيراط فضه والروزكاي بحبتين الى ثلاث حبات. وكانت مدينه بغداد مدوره ويبلغ طول قطرها نحو 2615 مترا، واحيطت بخندق وسورين بينهما ساحه واسعه. ورسم في داخلها سكك (شوارع او ازقه) عديده على كل منها عدد من الطاقات، وكل هذه السكك مستقيمه تمتد من السور الى رحبه واسعه في وسط المدينه المدوره، وخص المنصور ابا حنيفه النعمان بالاشراف عليها فكان المشرف العام على بنائها اربعه اعوام، وعندما انتهى البناء نقل مجالس علمه اليها، حتى توفي في عام 150 هـ.\n\nبتولِي هارون الرشيد الحكم بدا عصر زاهر كان واسطه العقد في تاريخ الدوله العباسيه التي دامت اكثر من خمسه قرون، ارتقت فيه العلوم، وسمت الفنون والاداب، وعمَّ الرخاء ربوع الدوله الاسلاميه. ولقد امسك هارون الرشيد بزمام هذه الدوله وهو في نحو الثانيه والعشرين من عمرهِ، فاخذ بيدها الى ما ابهر الناس من مجدها وقوتها وازدهار حضارتها.\n\nاصدر الرشيد عند توليه الخلافه عفوا عاما امن كل من كان هاربا او مستخفيا عدا بعض الزنادقه.\nوانشا بما يعرف ببيت الحكمه في بغداد وزوّدها باعداد كبيره من الكتب والمؤلفات من مختلف بقاع الارض. وكانت تضم غرفًا عديده تمتد بينها اروقه طويله، وخُصصت بعضها للكتب، وبعضها للمحاضرات، وبعضها الاخر للناسخين والمترجمين والمجلدين. كما تمت في عهده اول ترجمه الى العربيه لاشهر كتاب علمي عرف في التاريخ وهو \"كتاب الاصول (الاركان) في الهندسه والعدد لاقليدس ، وتطورت العلوم خصوصًا الفيزياء الفلكيه والتقنيه، وابتكرت عدد من الاختراعات كالساعه المائيه. كما انشئ في عهده اول مصنع للورق ببغداد سنه 795 م وصار سوق الوراقين لاحقا الذي يضم مئات الحوانيت التي تبيع السلع الورقيه الفاخره مفخره عاصمه العباسيين وكان ورق بغداد يقدر تقديرا عاليا في المنطقه حتى ان بعض المصادر البيزنطيه تسمي الورق بصحف بغداد (Bagdatixon) في ربط مباشر بينه وبين مدينه بغداد\nانشا الخليفه العباسي هارون الرشيد اكبر مستشفى في بغداد، سماها باسمه، ضمت في كادرها امهر الاطباء، وتولى ادارتها كل من يوحنا بن ماسويه وجبريل بن بختيشوع، وكانت اشهر مستشفى في العالم القديم.\nاهتم هارون الرشيد بالاصلاحات الداخليه فبنى المساجد الكبيره والقصور الفخمه وفي عهده استعملت القناديل لاول مره في اضاءه الطرقات والمساجد. اعتنى الرشيد ايضًا بالزراعه واسس نظامها، فبنت حكومته الجسور والقناطر الكبيره وحفرت الترع والجداول الموصله بين الانهار، واسس ديوانًا خاصًا للاشراف على تنفيذ تلك الاعمال الاصلاحيه، ومن اعماله ايضًا تشجيع التبادل التجاري بين الولايات وحراسه طرق التجاره بين المدن، وقد شيّد مدينه الواقفه قرب مدينه الرقه على ضفاف الفرات لتكون مقرًا صيفيًا لحكمه.\nغدت بغداد قبله طلاب العلم من جميع البلاد، يرحلون اليها حيث كبار الفقهاء والمحدثين والقراء واللغويين، وكانت المساجد الجامعه تحتضن دروسهم وحلقاتهم العلميه التي كان كثير منها اشبه بالمدارس العليا، من حيث غزاره العلم، ودقه التخصص، وحريه الراي والمناقشه، وثراء الجدل والحوار. كما جذبت المدينه الاطباء والمهندسين وسائر الصناع. وكان الرشيد نفسه يميل الى اهل الادب والفقه والعلم، حتى ذاع صيت الرشيد وطبق الافاق ذكره، وارسلت بلاد الهند والصين واوروبا رسلها الى بلاطهِ تخطب وده، وتطلب صداقته.وقع خلاف بعد عامين من وفاه الرشيد بين ولديه الامين والمامون، وحوصرت بغداد لاول مره في تاريخها ودام الحصار اربعه عشر شهراً. وفي نهايه عام 812 اطبق جند هرثمه وطاهر قائدي المامون على الامين في بغداد وعزل هرثمه الجانب الشرقي الذي لم يكن يحميه سوى سور سرعان ما ازاله، بينما عسكر طاهر امام باب الانبار فسيطر بذلك على الجانب الغربي، ووجد الخليفه نفسه اخر الامر منعزلاً في قصر الخلد على شاطئ دجله وما لبث ان وقع في الاسر وهو يحاول الفرار وقُتل في اوائل عام 814، وبموته رُفع الحصار واصبحت بغداد المزدهره خرائب ورماداً، واثار موت الامين سخط اهل بغداد، وتمكن ابراهيم بن المهدي العباسي بفضل الخلاف بين الناس من ان يستولي على بغداد ويصبح صاحب الامر فيها ما يقرب من عامين غير ان خيانه قواده اجبرته على تسليم المدينه وزمام الحكم الى الخليفه المامون. وكانت بطانه المامون من الفرس تحاول نقل عاصمه الخلافه الى خراسان ليتم لهم التغلب على شئون الدوله، وتولى الحسن بن سهل العراق والحجاز واليمن فاضطرب حبل الامن ودبت الفتن في بغداد الى ان دخلها المامون عام 820، وعادت لبغداد شيء من نضرتها الى ان ادركته منيته عام 834، وقد عهد المامون بالخلافه من بعده لاخيه المعتصم، وظلت بغداد تموج بالفتن حتى انه في عام 1157 لم يبقَ من تلك المملكه المتراميه الاطراف الا بغداد واعمالها وقليل مما يتصل بها. وقد انتقلت العاصمه العباسيه في زمن المعتصم عام 837 من بغداد الى سامراء، وقد اعادها الخليفه العباسي المعتمد عام 893 الى بغداد، واقام في دار الخلافه بالجانب الشرقي من نهر دجله.\nفي منتصف القرن العاشر، استولى ال بويه على بغداد، والذين يرجع نسبهم الى ملوك الفرس الساسانيين. وقد كان ذلك الاستيلاء في عام 945 بقياده احمد معز الدوله، والذي اعلن نفسه حاميا على الخلافه حتى 1055، حيث كان حكم الخليفه في بغداد صوريًا. وقد شجّع البويهيون على نشر المذهب الشيعي في المنطقه. تصارعت فروع الاسره فيما بينها فعمت الاضطرابات ارجاء الدوله. انتهى الامر بان قُسمت دوله الى فرعين، اولهما في العراق والاخر في كرمان. قضى الغزنويون على فرع البويهيين في الري سنه 1023، ثم انهى السلاجقه ما تبقى من دولتهم وحلوا محلهم في بغداد.\nينتمي السلاجقه الى احدى العشائر المتزعمه لقبائل الغز التركيه. وقد توسعت الدوله السلجوقيه في انحاء مختلفه من تركيا وايران، حتى استولت على العراق سنه 1055، بعد القضاء على دوله البويهيين في بغداد، واعلنوا نفسهم كحاميين للخلافه العباسيه. وقد استمر حكمهم لاراضٍ شاسعه حتى قضى عليهم الخوارزمشاهات سنه 1194.\n\nالمغول والتتار\nكان المغول تحت قياده جنكيز خان قد دمروا ولايه خوارزم شاه عند وفاه الخليفه ابو العباس احمد الناصر لدين الله في 1225، واحتلوا معظم اقسام ايران الشماليه. تمكن جيش الخليفه العباسي المستنصر، حفيد الناصر من دحر الهجوم المغولي على اراضي العراق العربيه. وتحت حكم ابنه المستعصم، حاصر المغول بغداد في 1245 دون تحقيق نجاح. الا ان الفيضانات الفظيعه التي حدثت في الاعوام 1243، 1253، 1255 و 1256 خلخلت دفاعات المدينه، وخيرات المنطقه وثقه المواطنين.\nفي عام 1258، طُوقت بغداد بقوه مغوليه كبيره يقودها هولاكو، حفيد جنكيزخان، الذي كان قد اُرسل من منغوليا خصوصًا لكي يتعامل مع العباسيين. وقد سقطت المدينه في 10 شباط/ فبراير 1258، كما اندلعت في اثنائها نيران فتن داخليه انتهت باستيلاء التتار عليها وبقتل الخليفه المستعصم واولاده ورجال حاشيته واهل بطانته، وباستباحه بغداد مده طويله، وكانت بغداد حين حاصرها المغول غاصه باهل الاطراف من الذين اجفلوا امام الجيش المغولي الذين لم يرحموا شيخاً ولا طفلاً ولا امراه، وبهذا افلت شمس الخلافه العباسيه في بغداد بعد ان اشرقت عليها اكثر من خمسه قرون، وكان افولها كارثه على الامم الاسلاميه كافه. وقد ابقى هولاكو في اول الامر الاوضاع الاداريه في بغداد على النمط العباسي تقريباً، ورتب جماعه من الرقباء والامناء ليشرفوا على كل شيء، وبذلك اصبحت حكومه بغداد مدنيه تحت اشراف حكومه عسكريه.\n\nلقد دمّر المغول معظم مدينه بغداد فعليا، ويُقال ان 800,000 نسمه من سكانها قد ابيدوا. كما خُفضت منزله المدينه اداريا الى مركز ولايه. اما بقيه المدن في المنطقه العربيه من العراق مثل الحله والكوفه والبصره فقد رضخت الى شروط الغازي وابقيت على حالتها. اما الموصل في شمال العراق فقد اصبحت عاصمه ولايه دياربكر وديار ربيعه. كانت هاتان الولايتان تابعتين مثل المناطق العربيه في العراق الى سياسه دوله الخان الثانيه المغوليه، والتي كان مقرها في اذربيجان، التي بدورها كانت تابعه الى دوله الخان العظيم في الصين.\nلقد خلفت بغداد مدن عده في المنطقه مثل تبريز، والتي ظهرت كمركز تجاري رئيس وقاعده سياسيه في المنطقه. اخذ حكم المغول في بغداد والموصل عموما طابع الحكم المشترك الذي يشمل الاداريين المدنين من المسلمين والمسيحين واليهود يسندهم امر معسكر المغول. وبصوره عامه فان العراق مر بفتره من الانهيار السياسي والاقتصادي استمر لغايه القرن السادس عشر.\nفي منتصف القرن الرابع عشر، حكم الجلائريون بغداد. وهم احد العشائر المغوليه، لكنها تنتمي الى تجمع قبائل مختلف عن الذي ينحدر منه جنكيز خان، كما كان مواطنهم في بلاد ما وراء النهر. وقد انتزع الشيخ حسن برزك السلطه في بغداد سنه 1336، ثم حكم بصفه مستقله منذ 1340. تنازعت هذه السلاله مع القائد المغولي تيمورلنك لحكم العراق، مما ادى به الى غزو بغداد وطردهم منها سنه 1393. وقد عاد الجلائريون مره اخرى سنه 1395 الى المدينه، ثم كانت النتيجه ان عاد اليها تيمورلنك، ودمرها عن اخرها سنه 1401. عاد الجلائريون مجددا الى بغداد سنه 1406، فقامت قبائل القراقويونلو (الخراف السود) التركمانيه باجلاء اخر الجلائريين عن بغداد سنه 1411. بقي للاسره حكام في كل من البصره وخراسان، واستمروا حتى سنه 1432، عندما قضى التركمان عليهم نهائيًا. وظلت بغداد تحت الحكم التركماني من هذا التاريخ حتى عام 1509.\n\nالصفويون والعثمانيون\nسيطر الصفويون على المدينه في عام 1509 بقياده الشاه اسماعيل الصفوي. وبقيت تحت حكم الصفويين حتى انتزعها العثمانيون من يد الصفويين عام 1535، ولكن ما لبث الصفويون ان عادوا ليسيطروا عليها عام 1624م، وحدثت فيها مذبحه عند دخول جيش الشاه، وبقت تحت الحكم الصفوي حتى عام 1639م، حيث دخلها السلطان العثماني مراد الرابع عام 1638م.\n\nمن جهه اخرى، شهدت بغداد في الفتره الممتده من 1749 – 1831 حكم مماليك العراق حيث لم يكن للعثمانيين دور مباشر في حكم العراق. وقد بلغت دوله المماليك في العراق اوج قوتها في عهد سليمان باشا الكبير والذي دام حكمه 22 عاما (انظر: تاريخ بغداد بعد سقوط المماليك).\nكانت بغداد تحت الحكم العثماني مركزا لاياله بغداد ابتداء من عام 1535 وحتى عام 1864، حيث اصبحت بعدها مركزا لولايه بغداد. وقد تاسست بلديه المدينه في عام 1868، كما تم تعيين ابراهيم الدفتري اول رئيس بلديه لها. وتمثل سنه 1869 اهميه كبيره في تاريخ بغداد في العصر العثماني، حيث بدا فيها ما يمكن اعتباره عهدًا متميزًا من عهود العثمانيين وضع اسسه الوالي مدحت باشا بتطبيقه لعدد من الانظمه والقوانين الاصلاحيه التي شرعتها الدوله خلال عهد الاصلاحات واعاده البناء الذي اطلق عليه عهد التنظيمات. وكان من مُجمل اهميه بغداد للعثمانيين ان جعلوا مقر الفيلقِ السادس في الجيش العثماني في المدينه. وقد بقيت بغداد تحت الحكم العثماني حتى سقوط الدوله العثمانيه وقدوم الانجليز في عام 1917.\n\nالانتداب البريطاني\nكان اول نزول للقوات البريطانيه على ارض العراق في شهر ايلول/ سبتمبر سنه 1914 من منطقه الفاو، وهي بلده تقع اقصى الجنوب تطل على الخليج العربي. وقد ارسلت القوات البريطانيه من الهند بقصد ازاحه العثمانيين عن الخليج وحمايه منشات النفط في جنوب غرب ايران. حتى وصلت بغداد بعد جهود وخسائر كبيره بعد اكثر من سنتين ونصف السنه، دافعت خلالها القوات العثمانيه دفاعاً مستميتًا.\nوفي يوم الاحد 11 اذار/ مارس 1917، سقطت بغداد بقياده الجنرال البريطاني ستانلي مود، بعد سلسله من الانتصارات في يد الجيش البريطاني خلال القتال مع الاتراك العثمانيين في الحرب العالميه الاولى، كما وقعت بغداد كمعظم مناطق العراق الاخرى تحت الانتداب البريطاني.\nلم تمر الا سنوات قليله حتى انتشرت الروح الوطنيه بين العراقيين للتحرر من السيطره البريطانيه بسبب قرار الحكومه البريطانيه ربط العراق بالكومنولث البريطاني، وقرارها بتشكيل الاداره المدنيه في العراق، التي تراسها السير ارنولد ويلسون حتى ايار 1918 فتبعه السير بيرسي كوكس الذي الغى العديد من المؤسسات الاداريه العثمانيه، وانشا محلها مؤسسات عسكريه لاداره الشؤون المدنيه، ووضع على راسها ضباطًا من رتب عاليه، فحكموا بشكل صارم، وتصرفوا مع العراقيين بشكل مهين. فكان لتلك التصرفات ردود افعال معاكسه من قبل العراقيين، مما ادى الى انطلاق ثوره شعبيه عام 1920 لتمتد في كل اجزاء العراق، سُميت بثوره العشرين، وقد استمرت سته اشهر تقريباً.\n\nالتاريخ المعاصر\nاصبحت بغداد عاصمه لمملكه العراق بعد عام 1921. وقد مُنح العراق الاستقلال رسميًا في عام 1932، وزاد استقلاله في عام 1946. ازداد عدد سكان المدينه من 145,000 المقدر في عام 1900 الى 580,000 في عام 1950.\nقام اعضاء في «المربع الذهبي» في 1 نيسان/ ابريل 1941، ورشيد عالي الكيلاني بانقلاب في بغداد. عمل رشيد علي تثبيت حكومه مواليه للالمان وايطاليا المؤيدتان لاستبدال حكومه عبد الاله بن علي الهاشمي المواليه لبريطانيا. في 31 ايار/ مايو، بعد الثوره وبعد فرار رشيد علي وحكومته، استسلم رئيس بلديه بغداد للقوات البريطانيه والكومنولث. حدثت عقب الفوضى التي اعقبت سقوط حكومه رشيد عالي الكيلاني خلال انقلاب 1941 اعمال عنف ونهب نشبت في بغداد بالعراق واستهدفت سكان المدينه من اليهود في 1 حزيران/ يونيو 1941 خلال احتفالهم بعيد الشفوعوت اليهودي،  قبل ان تتمكن القوات البريطانيه من السيطره على المدينه. انتهت الحادثه في اليوم التالي لدى دخول البريطانيين بغداد وراح ضحيتها حوالي 175 قتيلا و 1،000 جريحا يهوديا، كما تم تدمير حوالي 900 منزلا تابعا لليهود.\nتركت هذه الحادثه اثرا عميقا لدى اليهود العراقيين وساعدت على سرعه هجرتهم الى فلسطين. فبحلول عام 1951 هاجر اكثر من 80% منهم من العراق.\nفي 14 تموز/ يوليو 1958، قام افراد من الجيش العراقي بقياده عبد الكريم قاسم بانقلاب للاطاحه بمملكه العراق. تم اعلان قيام الجمهوريه العراقيه وانتهاء حقبه العهد الملكي من خلال البيان الاول للحركه والذي اذاعه عبد السلام عارف من دار الاذاعه، وذلك بعد نجاحه في قلب نظام الحكم وقتل الملك فيصل الثاني، وقاموا بالسيطره على القياده العامه للجيش ودار الاذاعه ومجمع بداله الهاتف المركزي، من خلال قطاعات اللواء العشرين الذي تحت امرته.\nفي 17 تموز/ يوليو 1968، قام حزب البعث العربي الاشتراكي بالتحالف مع ضباط بعثيين بانقلاب على الرئيس عبد الرحمن عارف الذي استلم الحكم بعد وفاه اخيه عبد السلام عارف. وقد تم تعيين احمد حسن البكر رئيسا لمجلس قياده الثوره ورئيساً للجمهوريه وقائدًا عامًا للجيش واصبح صدام حسين نائب رئيس مجلس قياده الثوره، كما اصبح نائب رئيس الجمهوريه في عام 1972. يصف الكثير من العراقيين فتره البكر بالعصر الذهبي لبغداد، اذ قام العراق بتاميم النفط والقضاء على الامٌيه والبطاله.\nاستلم الرئيس صدام حسين الحكم في عام 1979. وسرعان ما ادخل البلاد في حرب مع ايران دامت ثماني سنوات ابتداءً من عام 1980. ولم تدم فتره السلم الا عامين حتى غزى الكويت عام 1990، لتبدا حرب الخليج الثانيه على العراق بقياده قوات التحالف. وقد تم تدمير الكثير من البنى التحتيه للعاصمه بغداد من طرق وجسور وحتى محطات توليد الكهرباء. كما تم بعدها فرض حصار اقتصادي على العراق دام لمده 13 عام حتى سقوط حكم حزب البعث في العراق عام 2003.\n\nالاحتلال الامريكي\n\nشنّت الولايات المتحده حربًا على العراق في عام 2003 بحجه وجود اسلحه للدمار الشامل. وبعد ثلاثه اسابيع من بدايه الحمله، بدات القوات الامريكه تحركها نحو العاصمه بغداد. كان التوقع الاولي ان تقوم القوات المدرعه الامريكيه بحصار المدينه وتقوم بحرب شوارع في بغداد باسناد من القوه الجويه الامريكيه، خاصه بعد المعارك التي حدثت مع القوات العراقيه في الجنوب.\nاعلنت القوات الامريكيه في 9 نيسان/ ابريل 2003 بسط سيطرتها على معظم المناطق بعد انهيار الدفاعات العراقيه بشكل مفاجئ، ونقلت وكالات الانباء مشاهد لحشد صغير يحاولون الاطاحه بتمثال للرئيس العراقي صدام حسين في وسط ساحه الفردوس، والتي قاموا بها بمساعده من ناقله دبابات امريكيه وقام المارينز بوضع العلم الامريكي على وجه التمثال ليستبدلوه بعلم العراق فيما بعد، بعد ان ادركوا ان للامر رموزًا ومعاني قد تثير المشاكل. وقد تولى القائد العسكري الامريكي تومي فرانكس قياده العراق في تلك الفتره باعتباره القائد العام للقوات الامريكيه.\nتسبب هذا الغزو باضرار كبيره في بغداد شملت جميع القطاعات بما فيها النقل، الطاقه، البنيه التحتيه والصحه. ولا تزال المدينه تعاني من نتائج هذه الحرب الى اليوم.\nالوضع الحالي\nبدا انسحاب القوات الامريكيه من العراق في عام 2009، واستمر لعامين، حيث غادر اخر جندي امريكي البلاد في 18 كانون الاول/ ديسمبر 2011. وقد اتى هذا الانسحاب بعد ضغوط داخليه وخارجيه على الاداره الامريكيه، حيث خسرت الولايات المتحده خلال احتلالها للعراق 4474 قتيلاً و 33 الف جريح حسب الارقام الرسميه، كما انفقت حوالي تريليون دولار. من جهه اخرى، عانى العراق من تبعات هذا الانسحاب سياسيًا وامنيًا. وقد شهدت بغداد عددًا كبيرًا من التفجيرات التي تلت هذا الانسحاب، نتيجه الخروقات الامنيه.\n\nالتسميه\nتجمع المصادر التاريخيه ان الخليفه العباسي الثاني ابوجعفر المنصور قد قرر بناء عاصمه له تليق بمكانه الدوله الاسلاميه المتصاعده، فاختار بعد تدقيق وتمحيص موقعًا على نهر الصرا بين نهري دجله والفرات، حيث كانت تقوم قريه تسمى بغداد. كان يجتمع فيها تجار البلاد في راس كل شهر. وتجمع المصادر على ان اسم القريه الاصليه في ذلك الموقع هو (بغداذ) و (بغدان) او تبدل الباء ميمًا فيصير الاسم (مغداد) او (مغدان). وهذه الاسماء كلها ممنوعه من الصرف ولكنها تقبل التذكير والتانيث، فتقول (هذا بغداد) و (هذه بغداد). ويشتق منها الفعل «تبغدد» او «تبغدن» بمعنى سكن بغداد او تشبه باهلها.\nوسماها بانيها ابوجعفر المنصور (مدينه السلام) وهو الاسم الرسمي الذي ظهر في وثائق الدواوين العباسيه وعلى النقود والاوزان. كما اطلقت على المدينه اسماء اخرى مثل (دار السلام) و (مدينه المنصور) و (مدينه الخلفاء) و (المدينه المدوره) و (عاصمه الرشيد) و (الزوراء). ولكن الاسم القديم (بغداد) هو الذي ظل عالقًا في اذهان الناس ويتردد على السنتهم، فاحتفظت المدينه بذلك الاسم حتى يومنا هذا.\nالمعنى الفارسي لاسم مدينه بغداد\nكانت اللغه الفارسيه هي اللغه الرسميه والمعتمده في العراق منذ سقوط الدوله البابليه عام 539 ق.م الى مجيئ الفتح الاسلامي باستثناء فترات قصيره خضع فيها العراق لاحتلال الاغريق ثم الرومان. وكانت قريه بغداد الاصليه قائمه اثناء الحكم الساساني للعراق. وهكذا جاء اقدم المؤرخين الذين تطرقوا الى اسم مدينه بغداد مثل المقدسي وابن رسته بتفسيرات مستمده من اللغه الفارسيه لاسم بغداد. وقد ترددت تلك التفسيرات في كتب المؤرخين اللاحقين. واكثر هذه التفسيرات شيوعا هو القائل ان (باغ) تعني بستان بالفارسيه و (داد) تعني عطيه، فيكون معنى الاسم (البستان العطيه)، او (باغ) اسم صنم او شيطان و (داد) عطيه او هبه فيكون المعنى (عطيه الصنم). وقد قرب بعض المعاصرين المعنى فقال انها تعني (هبه الله). فلا غرابه في ان البكري (ت 487 هجري) قد ضمن اسم بغداد في مصنفه المعروف باسم معجم ما استعجم لانه عد الاسم اعجميا واردفه بمعناه العربي.\nالمعنى السومري والاكدي لاسم مدينه بغداد\nكشفت الحفريات الاثاريه في موقع بغداد عن واجهه كبيره مبنيه بالاجر البابلي وعليها اسم الملك البابلي الشهير نبوخذنصر (605 - 562 ق.م) والقابه. من ناحيه اخرى، وجدت وثائق بابليه تحمل اسم بلده (بغداد) تعود احداها، وهي وثيقه قضائيه الى ايام الملك البابلي حمورابي (1792 - 1750 ق.م) صاحب مسله القوانين البابليه الشهيره.وهكذا فان اسم (بغداد) كان قد اُستعمل قبل الف عام على الاقل من دخول كلمه (باغ) بمعنى الصنم او الاله_الرب الى اللغه الاراميه وعند العوده الى المعجم الذي اصدره الدكتور بهاءالدين الوردي للغه السومريه، نجد ان بغداد تعني (قلعه قبيله الصقر) او (هيكل الصقر)  وهذا مايؤيده عالم الاشوريات الفرنسي لابات في معجمه الخاص بالعلامات الاكديه.\nاسماء بغداد الاخرى\nلقد اختلف مؤرخو مدينه بغداد حتى في معنى اسمها العربي الواضح (مدينه السلام). فراى بعضهم ان المقصود بالسلام هو الله. ويرى بعضهم ان المنصور اسماها مدينه السلام، لان نهر دجله يقال له (وادي السلام). ويرى بعضهم الاخر ان المنصور اسماها (مدينه السلام) تفاؤلا في انها ستكون امنه مطمئنه. فالسلام شرط اساسي لازدهار المدن ورفاهيتها.\nاما مدينه المنصور ومدينه الخلفاء والمدينه المدوره والزوراء فهي اوصاف لبغداد استخدمها الخاصه والعامه في نعت المدينه. فتسميه (مدينه المنصور) هي تعريف للمدينه باضافتها الى بانيها ، وكذلك (مدينه الخلفاء) تعريفٌ لها باضافتها الى ساكنيها بعد تعاقب عدد من الخلفاء العباسيين على الاقامه فيها. و (المدينه المدوره) نعت للمدينه يميزها عن غيرها من المدن، ظنًا من الناعتين بانها المدينه الوحيده التي بنيت على شكل دائره. و (الزوراء) نعت كذلك، اُطلق عليها لان الابواب الداخليه لاسوارها مزوره عن الابواب الخارجيه، اي ليست على سمتها كما يقول ياقوت الحموي. ويستخدم ترتيب مداخل ابواب السور على هذا الشكل المنحني او المنكسر لاغراض دفاعيه. ومن المحتمل ان هذه الطريقه قد استخدمت اول مره في بغداد  كما اورد الحميري (ت 900 هجريه) في كتابه (الروض المعطار في خبر الاقطار) حين قال: وكان بعضهم يسميها (الصياده) لانها تصيد القلوب.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع بغداد على خط عرض 33 وخط طول 44 على نهر دجله، في المنطقه الوسطيه للعراق، حيث تقع ما بين المدن الرئيسيه شمالاً وجنوبًا، فتبعد عنها البصره 445 كم الى الجنوب، بينما تقع شمالاً كل من الموصل على بعد 350 كم واربيل على بعد 320 كم.\nاما عن مدن الجوار، فيقع الى الغرب كل من دمشق على بعد 750 كم، عمّان على بعد 800 كم، بيروت على بعد 830 كم، القدس على بعد 875 كم والقاهره على بعد 1290 كم. وتقع جنوبا كل من الكويت على بعد 545 كم والرياض على بعد 980 كم. اما من الشرق فتقع طهران على بعد 700 كم، والى الشمال الغربي تقع انقره على بعد 1250 كم.\n\nالموقع والطبوغرافيا\nتقع مدينه بغداد على بعد 85 كم شمال موقع مدينه بابل الاثريه، وعلى بعد بضعه كيلومترات شمال غرب مدينه قطسيفون (المدائن) والتي استمرت كمركز رئيسي للبلاد حتى حلت محلها بغداد في اوائل العصر العباسي. في 30 تموز 762 كلٌف الخليفه المنصور ببناء المدينه، وكان البناء تحت اشراف البرامكه. اعتقد المنصور ان بغداد ستكون المدينه المثاليه لتكون عاصمه للامبراطوريه الاسلاميه تحت حكم العباسيين. اختار ابو جعفر بنفسه رقعه مرتفعه من الارض، على الجانب الغربي من دجله عند مصب نهر الرفيل فيه، وقرر ان يشيّد عاصمته الجديده على هذه الرقعه.\n\nتُعد بغداد اكبر مدن العراق وايضًا من كبريات مدن الشرق الاوسط وثاني اكبر مدينه عربيه معاصره بعد القاهره في مصر. ومدينه بغداد من المدن التي ترتبط بتاريخ الخلافه العباسيه ان لم يكن تاريخ العالم الاسلامي خلال القرون الخمسه من عام 150 هـ/767م الى 656 هـ/1258م، فكان ابو جعفر المنصور ثاني خليفه عباسي واول من اتخذ بغداد عاصمه له بعدما قضى على منافسيه من العباسيين والعلويين في عام 145 هـ 762م، وبنى ابو جعفر المنصور على نهر دجله عاصمته بغداد في عام (145 - 149 هـ) 710 ميلاديه على شكل دائري، وهو اتجاه جديد في بناء المدن الاسلاميه، لان مـعظم المدن الاسلاميه، كانت اما مستطيله كالفسطاط، او مربعه كالقاهره، او بيضاويه كصنعاء. ولعل السبب في ذلك يرجع الى ان هذه المدن نشات بجوار مرتفعات حالت دون استدارتها. ويُعتبر تخطيط المدينه المدوره (بغداد)، ظاهره جديده في الفن المعماري الاسلامي ولا سيما في المدن الاخرى التي شيّدها العباسيون مثل مدينه سامراء وما حَوته من مساجد وقصور خلافيه فخمه. والى جانب العماره وجدت الزخرفه التي وصفت بانهما لغه الفن الاسلامي، وتقوم على زخرفه المساجد والقصور والقباب باشكال هندسيه او نباتيه جميله تبعث في النفس الراحه والهدوء والانشراح. وسُمي هذا الفن الزخرفي الاسلامي في اوروبا باسم ارابسك.\n\nتمثل بغداد حاليًا حاله من حالات التتابع المدني في اطار موقع واحد ففي اطار موقع الرافدين تتابعت العواصم من بابل القديمه الى سلوقيه الاغريقيه وقطيسنون الفارسيه التي كانت تعرف بمدائن كسرى ثم بغداد العربيه الحاليه. لا تزال نواه بغداد القديمه موجوده حتى الان تنتشر حولها الاجزاء الحديثه حول البوابات الشماليه والجنوبيه القديمه على الجانب الغربي لنهر دجله على بعد 540 كم تقريبًا الى الشمال الغربي من الخليج العربي.\nوتكمن اهميه موقع بغداد في توافر المياه وتناقص اخطار الفيضانات مما ادّى بدوره الى اتساع رقعه المدينه وزياده نفوذها الى جانب سهوله اتصالها عبر دجله بواسطه الجسور التي تربطها بالجانب الايسر من النهر .\n\nاتجاه القبله\nاتجاه القِبله: 160° درجه من الشمال الى الغرب (جنوب الغرب).\nالمسافه ما بين مكه وبغداد: 1399 كم\n\nمناطق بغداد\nينقسم مركز العاصمه الى صوبَيْن (جانبين) هما الكرخ على الجانب الغربي لنهر دجله، والرصافه على الجانب الشرقي للنهر وفي كلا الجزئين نجد المباني الحديثه وعلى جانب الرصافه توجد منطقه الكراده ذات الشوارع الضيقه والمحلات الكثيره ويقصدها معظم سكان بغداد للتبضع، انّ بعض اسماء مناطق بغداد هي قديمه من تراث بغداد كسبع ابكار، وقد ذُكر تفسير معانيها في كتب وبعض اسماءها حديثه كحي الخضراء، وفي عام 1908م اتخذت الحكومه العثمانيه اسماءً جديدهً لمحلات بغداد وشوارعها. وفي تشرين الاول عام 2000، اُعلنَ في بغداد عن مبادره حكوميه لتغيير بعض اسماء مناطق بغداد وشوارعها تنفيذاً لمقاصد «حمله الانسجام بين المكان والحاضر والماضي»، ومن ذلك تغييرُ شارع كورنيش الاعظميه من اسم شارع بيرم التونسي الى شارع امرؤ القيس اذ رات لجنه الاسماء ان شارع الكورنيش يتوافق مع الرومانسيه المعهوده من امرؤ القيس، وذكر مسؤول اللجنه ان الاسماء «بعضها لا ينسجم مع الذوق العام لانها استمدت اسمائها من حادث او شخصيه»، وبيّنَ ان مقياس الاختيار ليس بشهره الاسم في مكانه بل يُنتقى «من التاريخ العربي والعراقي القديم والمعاصر»، وقال ان بعض المناطق لم تكن لها اسماء فاختاروا لها تسميه، واقرّ بوجود اسماء رسميه لا يعرفها الناس بسبب تجاهل الدوائر الحكوميه لاستعمال تلك الاسماء. وفي 1 حزيران عام 2017 اعلنَ مجلس محافظه بغداد عن تغيير اسم شارع ابن تيميه في جنوب الوزيريه الى شارع الشافعي. الجدول التالي يبين ببعض مناطق بغداد الرئيسيه:\n\nالمناطق الصناعيه في بغداد\nتمتد المناطق الصناعيه من مركز بغداد الى خارجها وضواحيها مثل الحي الصناعي في البياع، ومنطقه التاجي الصناعيه شمال المدينه.\n\nالمناخ\nيُعتبر مناخ بغداد مناخ صحراوي، حيث يتميز الصيف في العراق بارتفاع درجات الحراره. وقد لازم ارتفاع درجات الحراره في بغداد خلال السنوات الاخيره ظاهره هبوب العواصف الترابيه الخفيفه. ويعلل الخبراء شده هذه الظواهر في صيف بغداد بعد الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003، الى الاحتباس الذي يعانيه الجو في البلاد وازدياد نسبه الكربون في الجو نتيجه عوادم المولدات الكهربائيه، وازدياد ظاهره التصحر، وانجراف التربه، والجفاف، وتغيير البيئه العراقيه ككل نتيجه الاهمال المتعمد وعدم وضع الحلول العاجله.\nوتوجد في محافظه بغداد محطه رصد جوي واقعه في مطار بغداد الدولي، تاسست منذ تاسيس المطار. وتعمل على الرصد السطحي وذلك بنقل الحاله السائده على ارض المطار كل ساعه الى قسم التنبؤ الجوي وقسم الرقابه الجويه في المطار.\n\nالسكان\nتُعتبر بغداد في الوقت الحاضر اكبر مدن العراق، حيث يسكن محافظه بغداد قرابه 7.2 مليون نسمه. فيما بلغ عدد سكان المحافظه عام 2009 قرابه 6.7 مليون نسمه. كما تُعتبر ثاني كبريات العواصم العربيه من حيث حجمها السكاني. ويتكون معظم سكان مدينه بغداد من العرب المسلمين والاكراد الفيليين واقليات من المسيحيين والصابئه واليزيديين، فيما كان اليهود قبل عام 1948م، يشكلون نسبه كبيره من السكان وكانوا اكبر طائفه غير مسلمه لكن عددهم تناقص بشكل حاد بعد اعلان نشوء دوله اسرائيل على ارض فلسطين وهجرتهم الجماعيه نهايه الاربعينيات وبدايه الخمسينيات.\nلقد قفزت نسبه سكان بغداد الى مجموع سكان عموم العراق بشكل كبير جداً في خلال بضعه عقود من الزمن. كما انعكست تلك الزياده الكبيره في عدد السكان في اكتظاظ سكاني خانق في العديد من مناطق بغداد السكنيه وعلى الخصوص في مركز مدينه بغداد. وقد تجاوزت الكثافه السكانيه لمدينه الثوره (مدينه الصدر) اعلى معدلات الكثافه السكانيه المسجله في المنطقه. تزامنت تلك الظاهره السريعه مع فتره اضطرابات غير مسبوقه في تاريخ العراق الحديث، فقد تفجرت ازمه سكن حاده في بغداد، وبدات تظهر اختناقات مروريه، وعجز واسع النطاق في الخدمات الاساسيه لحياه المواطنين البغداديين كالنقص في تجهيز مياه الشرب والنقص في تجهيزات الطاقه وخدمات الاتصالات.\nالجدول الاتي يظهر عدد سكان مدينه بغداد التقريبي من عام 1800 وحتى 2010:\n\nالاقتصاد\nمن الناحيه الاقتصاديه، تُعد بغداد مركزًا للعديد من المصانع والورش، والمركز الرئيسي للصناعه في العراق كما تعد مركزًا تجاريًّا رئيسيًّا وحلقه وصل بين تركيا وسوريا والهند وجنوب شرق اسيا والسوق التجاري الرئيسي في الدوله وايضًا تعد مركزاً سياحياً هاماً يزوره اكثر من مليون سائح في السنه قبل الحصار حيث كان المطار الدولي يعمل وتُعد ايضًا بغداد من المناطق الزراعيه حيث ان كثيرا من توابعها يعتمد على زراعه كثير من الغلات.\n\nالصناعه\nيُعد كل من السجاد والجلود والمنسوجات ومنتجات الاسمنت والتبغ، اهم المنتجات في بغداد. كما يُعتبر انتاج وتكرير النفط ايضًا احد اهم الانشطه الاقتصاديه في المدينه. حيث ثبت ان حقل نفط شرق بغداد يحمل احد اكبر الاحتياطيات في العراق (18 بليون برميل). وتُعتبر مصفاه الدوره التي تقع على مشارف المدينه هي ثالث اكبر مصفاه في العراق من حيث القدره على الانتاج (100,000 برميل باليوم الواحد). يُشار بالذكر الى ان بغداد تحتضن سنويًّا معرضًا عالميًا لمختلف الصناعات حول العالم، هو معرض بغداد الدولي.\n\nالزراعه\nتنتشر في المدينه بساتين النخيل، وتتركز بكثافه على ضفاف نهر دجله. وتُعتبر الوثائق العثمانيه وخصوصا سندات الطابو واحده من اهم المصادر التاريخيه التي توثق ذلك، لما لها من اهميه بعد اصدار الدوله العثمانيه لقانون الاراضي عام 1859. حيث تشير هذه الوثائق الى ان بساتين النخيل كانت تاريخيا موجوده على ضفتي نهر دجله، بالاضافه لوجود بساتين اخرى تحوي اشجار مثمره كالحمضيات، كما تنتج هذه الاراضي محاصيلا وفيره.\n\nالتجاره\nكان من نتيجه وقوع بغداد تاريخيًا على مسار طريق الحرير العالمي، وفي وسط العراق حديثًا، ان اصبح موقعها يتحكم بالاقتصاد الوطني بشكل كبير. ولقد لعبت الاسواق التجاريه في المدينه منذ القدم دورا مهما محوريا في الحركه التجاريه والاقتصاديه. وتشهد اسواق المدينه نشاطا كبيرًا على مدار العام وتعرض فيها سلع ومنتجات محليه او مستورده من مناشئ مختلفه.\nوتختلف هذه الاسواق من حيث التراث والحداثه او حسب نوعيه السلع التي تتعامل فيها، فمنها ما يُعتبر من الاسواق التراثيه، كسوق الصفافير وسوق السراي، وسوق الساعاتيه، وسوق الاسترابادي، وسوق المستنصر، وسوق دانيال، ومنها ما هو اسواق للجمله، ويتركز هذا النوع في سوقين رئيسيين هما سوق جميله، وسوق الشورجه. بالاضافه الى الخانات القديمه. كما تحوي المدينه على الكثير من الاسواق الجديده كالسوق العربي، وسوق الارمن، وسوق الكنيسه، والسوق العباسي. هذا بالاضافه الى المجمعات التجاريه الحديثه، حيث ظهرت في السبعينيات والثمانينات من القرن العشرين الاسواق المركزيه في عدد من المناطق البغداديه. اما اليوم فيوجد عدد من مراكز التسوق الكبيره نسبيًا في بعض الاماكن التجاريه من العاصمه.\n\nبغداد الرسميه\nتحوي المدينه على مراكز الحكم الرئيسيه في البلاد، بالاضافه الى الوزارت والسفارات الاجنبيه ومقرات المنظمات الدوليه العامله في العراق. كما توجد في بغداد اهم القصور الرئاسيه التي يعود تاريخها الى فترات مختلفه، منها القصر الجمهوري، وقصر الفاو، قصر الرحاب، قصر الزهور، وقصر السلام. وتُعد منطقه كراده مريم (المنطقه الخضراء بعد 2003) اهم المناطق التي تقع فيها هذه المؤسسات الاداريه.\n\nامانه بغداد\nيعود تاريخ تاسيس امانه بغداد الى زمن الدوله العثمانيه في عهد الوالي مدحت باشا عام 1868، حيث كانت بمستوى بلديه. وجاءت تسميه امانه العاصمه وتسميه رئيسها بـ «امين العاصمه» بعد صدور قانون اداره البلديه عام 1931. وبموجبه تم الغاء قانون البلديات العثماني السابق وجميع الانظمه والتعليمات الصادره بموجبه. لقد كان ارتباط امانه العاصمه بوزاره الداخليه حتى قيام ثوره 14 تموز عام 1958. في عام 1987، تم تغيير تسميه «امانه العاصمه» الى «امانه بغداد»، كذلك تم الغاء محافظه بغداد وجعلها مدينه بغداد بعد ان تم تعديل ارتباط الوحدات الاداريه التابعه لها ووضعت حدود جديده لمدينه بغداد واُعيد ارتباط الامانه بمجلس الوزراء وهو الحال القائم حاليًا. الا ان اعاده المحافظه قد تم في وقت لاحق.\n\nالبنيه التحتيه\nتتكون بغداد من شبكه من الخطوط السريعه والطرق الرئيسيه والثانويه تغطي جميع انحاء المدينه. وترتبط بمطار بغداد الدولي عبر طريق سريع يمتد الى الجهه الغربيه منها. كما ترتبط بمدن العراق الاخرى وبمدن الجوار عبر عدد من الطرق السريعه، اهمها طريق المرور السريع 1 الذي يربط عدد من الدول العربيه مرورًا ببغداد، فضلاً عن الطريق الاستراتيجي الممتد من مدينه زاخو في الشمال الى محافظه البصره مروراً ببغداد. وتُعد الطرق التاليه من اهم واشهر الشوارع الرئيسيه الداخليه في المدينه: 14 رمضان، وابو نؤاس، والمتنبي، والمغرب، والاميرات، والرشيد، والفضل، والنضال، وحيفا، وعمر بن عبد العزيز، وفلسطين، وغيرها. كما يمر بالمدينه عدد من السكك الحديديه التي تربط شمال العراق بجنوبه، فهناك خط سكك حديد بغداد – الموصل، وخط سكك حديد بغداد – البصره.\nوقد تاثرت البنيه التحتيه في بغداد اسوهً بباقي مدن وقرى العراق، بشكل كبير نتيجه للحروب التي خاضتها البلاد في العقود الاخيره، والحصار الاقتصادي الذي فُرض عليه لمده 13 عام. ثم تلى ذلك الغزو الامريكي للعراق في عام 2003، والاداره السيئه للموارد بعده، واللذان اثرا سلبا بشكل كبير على ما تبقى من بنيه تحتيه.\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nازداد الازدحام في مدينه بغداد، ولا سيما بعد الاحتلال الامريكي سنه 2003، حين تكاثر استيراد السيارات، قال عضو مجلس النواب، جاسمُ البخاتي، في يوم 16 اذار سنه 2021 «ان طرق بغداد مصممه لاستيعاب 700 الف سياره، بينما يتجول فيها الان ما بين 2.5 و 3 ملايين سياره»، تُعتبر الحافلات والمركبات الصغيره الوسائل الرئيسيه للتنقل داخل مدينه بغداد. ويوجد من هذه الحافلات ما هو عام تابع للمنشاه العامه للنقل، ومنها ماهو خاص. اما بالنسبه للمركبات فتُستخدم سيارات الاجره والسيارات الخاصه.\nكما يُعد النقل النهري عبر نهر دجله من الوسائل الشائعه ايضًا لدى البغداديين، حيث تختصر القوارب الكثير من الوقت والمسافات، خاصه بعد الوضع الامني السيئ الذي تلى الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003، والذي نتج عنه اغلاق عدد كبير من الطرق والجسور الرئيسيه في المدينه، ووضع نقاط تفتيش وجدارن كونكريتيه حالت دون وصول المواطنين الى العديد من الاماكن عبر المركبات بصوره طبيعيه، وادت الى اختناقات مروريه كبيره. ويُسمح لهذه القوارب التنقل بين عدد قليل من جسور بغداد البالغ عددها 13 جسرًا.\nوكان من المفترض انشاء مشروع مترو في المدينه منذ عده عقود، كما كانت هناك خطط لبناء هذا النظام. وقد بُنيَ فعلا جزء من الانفاق، ولكنها استخدمت لاغراض عسكريه. بدات الحكومه العراقيه في تشرين الثاني / نوفمبر 2008 بدراسات الجدوى لبناء خطين تحت الارض في كل من بغداد والنجف جنوب البلاد، الا ان المشروع لم يرَ النور الى الان.\n\nسكك الحديد\n\nشهد العراق اول خط حديدي لعربات الترام عام 1869، عندما اسس الوالي العثماني مدحت باشا شركه ترامواي بغداد - الكاظميه، حيث استخدمت الخيول لجر العربات، وكان يعرف لدى العراقيون ب «الكاري». وقد تشكلت اول اداره للسكك الحديد في العراق في عام 1916، وكانت انذاك تحت سيطره الجيش البريطاني. ثم انتقلت الى اداره مدنيه بريطانيه عام 1920، ثم تحولت الى اداره مدنيه عراقيه في 1936. وقد تم تسيير اول رحله من بغداد الى سميكه الدجيل الواقعه الى الجنوب من مدينه سامراء عام 1914.\nتقوم الشركه العامه لسكك الحديد حاليا بتسيير رحلات للقطار بين بغداد والبصره، حيث سُير اول قطار بينهما عام 1920. في حين انه قد تم تسيير اول قطار بين بغداد وكركوك عام 1925، واول قطار بين بغداد والموصل عام 1940، واول قطار من العراق الى محطه حيدر باشا في اسطنبول في 15 تموز عام 1940. وقد تم تشغيل اول قطار على الخط القياسي في العراق بين بغداد والبصره عام 1967.\nتضرر قطاع سكك الحديد في العراق بفعل الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003 وما اعقبه من عمليات نهب، حيث لم يعد صالحًا للاستخدام من القاطرات سوى عدد قليل. كما ان الوضع الامني غير المستقر ادى الى توقف الرحلات بشكل نهائي في فترات معينه.\n\nالعماره والتخطيط الحضري\nتميز النمط المعماري البغدادي بتناغم متناسق بين الناحيه الوظيفيه والناحيه الجماليه. وقد راعى المعمار العراقي عند تشييد الدار البغدادي الظروف المناخيه واحياءها ومحلاتها، وجعل النوافذ المطله على الخارج قليله الفتحات ومقاربه لنوافذ الجانب الاخر من الدور، وجعل الفسحات المكشوفه متجهه لوسط الدار ليوفر بذلك جوًا مظللاً منورًا قد الامكان مراعيًا الظروف الاجتماعيه السائده حينذاك. وقد اكثر المعمار البغدادي من استخدام الخشب للحد من تقلبات درجه الحراره في داخل الدار.\nكان الطابوق ولا يزال يُعتبر الماده الاساسيه في بناء العماره البغداديه لعدم توفر الحجر كما في بلاد الشام، كما استخدام الاجر في صياغه انواع من العقود المستديره والمدببه والتي كونت مع الطابوق مقرنصات جمعت بين الوظيفه الانشائيه وجماليه التشكيل. اما الاسقف التي اُقيمت على الاعمده فكانت مادتها الاساسيه الخشب.\nمن الجدير بالذكر ان بغداد شهدت في نهايه العشرينات من القرن العشرين نمطًا انتقاليًا بين النمط البغدادي القديم والنمط الذي ساد فيما بعد، والمتمثل بتشييد «محله السنك»، والتي استخدم في تشييدها نمط جديد تمثل في استخدام حديد الشيلمان في تسقيف الدور والمحلات العامه والخانات للاغراض التجاريه، كما ظهرت سينما الرشيد والحمراء وعلاء الدين.\nتمتاز ازقه بغداد واماكنها السكنيه القديمه كشارع الرشيد بعناصر معماريه مميزه، اهمها الشناشيل (المشربيات)، التي كانت ابرز معالمها. وتكتسب الشناشيل، او النوافذ الخشبيه المحفوره او المزخرفه، اهميه اجتماعيه لدى البغداديين، من حيث ضمان الخصوصيه في المنزل، فضلاً عن تخفيفها حده اشعه الشمس وتلطيف الهواء، كما ان بعضها مغطى بالزجاج اتقاءاً لبروده الشتاء. كما تنتشر البيوت التراثيه القديمه على مساحه وسعه من العاصمه، كما في شارع الكفاح وشارع الشيخ عمر والخلفاء والبتاويين والكاظميه والاعظميه والشواكه والكريمات.\n\nعماره الحداثه\nمرّت مدينه بغداد بتغيرات وتطورت مختلفه، اثرت على طابعها العمراني بشكل ملحوظ. وغير ذلك من نسيجها الحضري. وكان من ابرز التغيرات في عمارتها تلك الفتره التي تميزت ببزوغ وانتشار عماره الحداثه. فهي تمثل القتره بين الاربعينيات والسبعينيات من القرن العشرين والتي كان لها اسبابها العديده وعواملها المختلفه التي مهدت لانتشار عماره الحداثه. وقد تاسس في بغداد عام 1950 مجلس الاعمار العراقي، الذي نفذ وخطط للعديد من المشاريع الحيويه التي ما زالت قائمه وفعاله الى اليوم.\nشهدت حقبه الخمسينات وما بعدها نموًا واسعًا لفكر الحداثه في المجال المعماري. وقد برزت اسماء بغداديه كبيره في فن العماره والنحت مثل رفعت الجادرجي، محمد صالح مكيه، جواد سليم، خالد الرحال، محمد غني حكمت، زها حديد، وغيرهم. كما تمّت دعوه معماريين عالميين كبار لتصميم ابنيه في بغداد، ومن هؤلاء المعماريين جيو بونتي وفرانك لويد رايت والفار التو ووليم دودوك، ووالتر غروبيوس الذي صمّم ابنيه جامعه بغداد، بالاضافه الى فيرني مارج الذي صمّم المتحف العراقي الوطني، والذي جمع في تصميمه ثقافه بلاد الرافدين مع بناء حديث. غير ان العديد من هذه المشاريع تاجل تنفيذها لعقود او انها لم تُنفذ بتاتًا، كما هو الحال مع مشروع المدينه الاولمبيه الذي دعي لتصميمه المعماري لي كوربوزيه في العام 1956. ومن هذه المدينه لم يتم تنفيذ سوى قاعه الالعاب الرياضيه خلال الثمانينات وذلك باشراف احدى المؤسسات الفرنسيه وبتطابق تام مع التصميم الاصلي.\n\nالنسيج الحضري\nشهدت مدينه بغداد مراحل متعدده في نموها وتطورها كانت استجابه للمتغيرات العمرانيه والتخطيطيه والاقتصاديه والاجتماعيه والسياسيه، مما انعكس على نسيجها واستعمالات الارض فيها. وقد اتسمت بغداد في عشرينيات القرن العشرين بالنسيج المتضام العفوي والتدرج الهرمي للشوارع والازقه التي تنتهي بطرق غير نافذه، وكانت استعمالات الارض متداخله فيما بينها، وكان الطابع السكني هو الغالب على المدينه مع وجود المناطق التجاريه في المركز. وقد تحولت المدينه في الفتره الممتده من الثلاثينات وحتى نهايه الخمسينيات من النمو شبه الدائري الى الامتداد الطولي على محور نهر دجله، كما بدا النظام الشبكي للشوارع بالظهور.\nلقد وصلت مدينه بغداد الى مرحله النضج العمراني والتخطيطي في الفتره الممتده من الستينات وحتى اواخر السبعينات. وتوسعت المدينه بنمطين، الاول طولي على امتداد الطرق لرئيسيه، والثاني حول نوى وظيفيه ومعماريه كالاسواق والجوامع او تقاطعات الطرق.\nلقد تم وضع اول مخطط هيكلي لمدينه بغداد في عام 1956، وهو «مخطط مينوبريو، سبنسمي وماكفارليف» من المملكه المتحده، حيث يتالف من شبكه للطرق الرئسيه ومبان عامه جديده وتصاميم معماريه للمراكز الحكوميه مع تخصيص منطقه صناعيه جنوب بغداد. ولكن المخطط لم يُنفذ، حيث لم يتثمر نهر دجله، ولم تدرس فيه بدقه واقع المجتمع البغدادي واهميه الحفاظ على تراثه. لذا تم العمل على مخطط اخر هو «مخطط دوكسيادس» من اليونان في عام 1959. حيث كان مستطيلا مكون من شبكه تخطيطيه.\nومع حلول السبعينيات، ظهرت فكره تطوير «منطقه بغداد الكبرى»، وذلك عندما اوصى التصميم الانمائي الشامل لعام 1973 بان يتم اعداد تصميم العاصمه الاساسي في اطار خطه التنميه القوميه، وان فائض عدد سكان العاصمه على قابليه الاستيعاب المقرره المتاتي من الهجره ومن الزياده الطبيعيه لنمو السكان يتوجب توطينهم في منطقه بغداد الكبرى التي حددها التصميم الانمائى الشامل بدائره نصف قطرها يتراوح ما بين 50 - 55 كم من مركز بغداد، وهذه الدائره ايضًا تحاط بمنطقه دائره الاقليم المركزي ذو نصف القطر البالغ بما بمقداره من 100 - 120 كم من مركز العاصمه.\n\nدور العباده\nينتشر في مدينه بغداد الاف المساجد والحسينيات للمذاهب الاسلاميه المختلفه، كثير منها تم تصميمه على عماره اسلاميه. وتحوي المدينه على الكثير من المساجد الاثريه من العهد العباسي وحتى العثماني مثل جامع الخلفاء من عام 908، وجامع مرجان من عام 1356، وجامع سيد سلطان علي من عام 1589، جامع حسين باشا من عام 1674، وجامع العادليه من عام 1749، وجامع الحيدرخانه من عام 1819، وجامع الازبك من عام 1879، وجامع الشيخ معروف الكرخي من عام 1892. كما يوجد في المدينه عدد من المساجد الكبرى والمراقد التي لها اهميه تاريخيه، مثل مسجد الامام الاعظم (مرقد الامام ابو حنيفه النعمان) المؤسس عام 985، ومسجد الحضره الكاظميه (مرقد الامام موسى الكاظم) المؤسس عام 947. وجامع الشيخ عبد القادر الكيلاني في الحضره القادريه منذ عام 1534م.\nلقد ازدادت مساجد المدينه بشكل ملحوظ بعد الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003. وكانت من بين مظاهر الفوضى التي خلفتها الحرب، الانتشار العشوائي للجوامع والمساجد التي بنيت بالتجاوز على اراض مملوكه للغير او حوٌلت مبان حكوميه متروكه الى مساجد دون الحصول على الموافقات الرسميه اللازمه.\nتنتشر في المدينه عشرات الكنائس للطوائف المسيحيه المختلفه في مختلف انحائها، حيث تواجدت الطائفه المسيحيه في بغداد منذ انشائها في العصر العباسي. بل يُرجع بعض المؤرخون تواجد المسيحيه في موقع مدينه بغداد الحالي الى ما قبل انشاء مدينه بغداد على يد الخليفه ابو جعفر المنصور، حيث اشار بعض المؤرخون الى وجود اديره مسيحيه قديمه في اطراف موقع بغداد الحالي. وتضم بغداد على اكبر تجمع مسيحي في العراق، ويتالف المسيحيون في بغداد من عده طوائف غالبيتهم من الكلدان والسريان الكاثوليك لكن يوجد تجمع كبير للكنائس الاشوريه المشرقيه والسريانيه الارثوذكسيه مع تواجد اكبر تجمع بروتستانتي في العراق في بغداد.\nتضم بغداد بالاضافه لعدد من دور العباده التابعه للصابئه المندائيين. ويوجد في المدينه ايضًا كنيس يهودي في منطقه البتاوين، لكنه مهجور بسبب تهجير يهود العراق الى فلسطين في نهايه الاربعينيات وبدايه الخمسينيات من القرن العشرين. يُشار بالذكر الى ان اعمال العنف الذي شهدته البلاد وهجره المسيحيين بكثره مؤخرًا، اديّا الى اغلاق كثير من الكنائس في بغداد.\n\nمعالم بغداد\nالتعليم والتعليم العالي\nتاسست في بغداد منذ انشائها في القرن الثامن، عده مدارس تاريخيه كان لها دور كبير في الحضاره الاسلاميه، منها المدرسه المامونيه، المدرسه المستنصريه، المدرسه الموفقيه، المدرسه النظاميه، ومدرسه محمد امين السويدي. وتُعتبر بغداد تاريخيّا، المركز التعليمي الرئيس في العراق. كما كانت الحكومه العراقيه في الفتره المعاصره هي المسؤوله عن هذا القطاع لفتره طويله.\n\nلقد عانى قطاع التعليم والتعليم العالي في بغداد ابتداءً من حرب الخليج الاولى (1980 - 1988)، وحتى الغزو الامريكي للعراق في عام 2003، الذي استمرت تبعاته الى اليوم، حيث تعرضت الكثير من المنشات التعليميه للقصف او التفجيرات طيله العقود القليله الماضيه. وقد تدهور التعليم في العراق بشكل عام في الفتره الاخيره، مما ادى لظهور التعليم الخاص بموازاه التعليم الحكومي، بالاضافه لزياده كبيره في نسبه الاميه نتيجه للتهرب من المدارس.\nالتعليم الاساسي والاعدادي\nشهدت الفتره المتاخره من العهد العثماني في بغداد نهضه تعليميه. فقد انشا الوالي مدحت باشا اول مدارس بغداد المعاصره، وهي المدرسه الرشديه العسكريه سنه 1869، التي تخرج منها ضباطا عراقيين بعد دراسه 4 سنوات. كما تاسست اول مدارس المدينه الاعداديه عام 1888، وهي الاعداديه المركزيه، وكانت الثانويه الوحيده في المدينه. وتُعد اول مؤسسه علميه وثقافيه معاصره في بغداد وارتبط اسمها بتاريخ المدينه وذاكرتها الثقافيه. اما في عام 1889، فقد تم تاسيس اول مدرسه ابتدائيه حكوميه في المدينه ايام الوالي سري باشا، وقد تبرع ببنائها العلامه عبد الوهاب النائب، واُطلق عليها اسم «حميديه مكتبي». ويوجد في المدينه اليوم عدد كبير من المدارس، بعضها مخصص للطلبه الموهوبين مثل ثانويه المتميزين، وكليه بغداد.\nالتعليم العالي\nبالنسبه للتعليم الجامعي، فتحوي المدينه على خمسه جامعات رئيسيه. وقد تاسست اول جامعه في المدينه عام 1957، وهي جامعه بغداد، والتي تاسست كمدرسه للحقوق في بادئ الامر عام 1908. ثم تلاها الجامعات الاخرى، وهي الجامعه المستنصريه، والجامعه التكنولوجيه، وجامعه النهرين والجامعه العراقيه تاسست العديد من الكليات الاهليه والتي تكون تحت اشراف وزاره التعليم العالي والبحث العلمي، مثل كليه المنصور الجامعه، وكليه بغداد للصيدله، وغيرها العديد من الكليات والمعاهد.\n\nالثقافه\nاشتهرت بغداد منذ العصر العباسي بالشعراء والادباء والكتاب المعروفين، حيث ان الحراك الثقافي بدا يُبرز المدينه كواحده من اكثر العواصم العربيه تاثيراً في الثقافه والفنون. ويُعقد في بغداد سنويّا العديد من المهرجانات الثقافيه كمهرجان بغداد السينمائي الدولي. وتحوي المدينه على عدد كبير من الصروح الثقافيه الهامه كالمسرح الوطني العراقي، المتحف العراقي، ومكتبه بيت الحكمه. بالاضافه الى عدد من المقاهي الثقافيه الشهيره ودور العرض القديمه التي تقع في شارع الرشيد وشارع المتنبي، وغيرها. كما تزخر بغداد اليوم بالعديد من الاسماء الكبيره في مجالات الفن والادب والرسم والسينما وغيرهم الكثير من الفنانين.\nوكان الفن البغدادي الحديث قد انجب في مطلع الخمسينيات من القرن العشرين مجموعه اعمال ابداعيه كبيره ذات سمات جماليه جديده تميزت بانتمائها الجذري لتاريخ العراق وارتباطها الصريح بتطوره، كما كان لظهور ثوره الشعر الحر في العراق انعكاسًا في ازدهار الوعي الاجتماعي والثقافي في هذه الفتره. وقد ادى هذا الى تاسيس جماعه بغداد للفن الحديث عام 1951 على يد عدد من رواد الفن العراقي كشاكر حسن ال سعيد وجواد سليم وغيرهم، كما انضم لها نخبه من التشكيليين والمعماريين والفنانين العراقيين فيما بعد.\nاصبحت الجماعه بعد ظهورها مركز اشعاع فكري للفنانين العراقيين في الستينات والسبعينات، كما اسهموا في وضع لبنات جديده الى صرح الفن العراقي الحديث المعاصر.\n\nمن جهه اخرى، تم تاسيس المتحف الوطني للفن الحديث (مركز صدام للفنون سابقًا) في بغداد في ثمانينيات القرن العشرين، والذي ضم نخبه من اللوحات الفنيه لرواد الحركه التشكيليه المعاصره في العراق، الا انه تعرض للسرقه والاهمال مؤخرًا.\nشهدت البنى التحتيه الثقافيه في بغداد واقعًا سيئًا بعد الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003، حيث يتجلى هذا الواقع بنحو خاص في الحال الراهن للمرافق الثقافيه. فقد تم اغلاق معظم المتاحف والمكتبات ودور العرض وقاعات الفن التشكيلي في المدينه. في ظل هذه الظروف السيئه، تعد بغداد واحده من المدن المبدعه في قائمه اليونيسكو للمدن الابداعيه في المجال الادبي منذ عام 2015م، وتم اختيار بغداد عاصمه للثقافه العربيه لعام 2013، وقد شهد هذا العام زخمًا ثقافيًا لم تعهده المدينه منذ عام 2003، حيث اُقيمت عدد من العروض الموسيقيه والمسرحيه من العراق وبعض الدول العربيه، بالاضافه لمعارض الكتاب والفنون التشكيليه وملتقيات شعريه وادبيه اخرى.\nالتراث والفلكلور\n\nتتميز بغداد بارث حضاري وتراث فني وموسيقي كبيرين، حيث يُعد المقام العراقي من الفنون الموسيقيه العربيه القديمه، ويعتبره البعض ارقى شكل من اشكال المقام. وتمتاز المدينه بمقام الجالغي البغدادي، والذي يقوم باداءه قارئ، بالاضافه الى عدد من العازفين على الات السنطور، الجوزه، والطبله او الدنبك واحياناً اله الرق. ويُعتبر الفنان محمد القبانجي من اهم مؤديي هذا الفن في القرن العشرين.\n\nيُعتبر المتحف البغدادي من اهم الصروح الثقافيه التي تؤرخ لتراث بغداد في التاريخ المعاصر. وقد عمدت امانه بغداد على انشاء هذا المتحف عام 1968 بالقرب من المدرسه المستنصريه ليضم غالبيه المعالم الحياتيه لسكان بغداد الاوائل، ويوثق بموضوعيه فتره زمنيه من تاريخ العاصمه. ويضم اليوم بعد التوسعه 385 تمثالاً توزعت على 77 مشهدا. كما قامت محافظه بغداد في عام 2011 باعاده تاهيل وافتتاح احد المباني التراثيه القديمه في شارع المتنبي كمركز ثقافي بغدادي، والذي يوفر مصادر تراثيه عبر مكتبه بغداد، وهي مكتبه تراثيه تعنى بتاريخ وتراث هذه المدينه.\nوقد تحدث الكثيرون من الكتاب والمؤرخين عن بغداد القديمه وتاسيسها وتسميتها، ووصفوا تراثها ومميزاته، حيث تميزت المدينه بحرف كثيره كصناعه النحاسيات (الصفر)، وتعد صناعه الصفر من اقدم الصناعات الشعبيه في بغداد والعراق، كما عُرف عن سوق الصفافير انه قبله السواح قبل عقود من الزمن، الا ان السوق في الوقت الحاضر يشهد انحسار كبير بسبب الحروب واعوام الحصار والوضع الامني المتدهور، وقطع اجزاء من شارع الرشيد وجعله ممرًا واحدًا.\nبغداد في الشعر والفن\nلبغداد مكانه كبيره في ذاكره الشعراء. وقد كُتب عنها الكثير وروي الاكثر، مثلما تركت على مستوى العماره والبناء والفعليه الحياتيه، مايستحق ان يقال عنه الكثير. ولقد تغنى الادباء ببغداد على طول امتداد عمرها منذ بناها الخليفه ابو جعفر المنصور. الابيات التاليه هي بعض ما عبّر به شعراء عرب في وصف بغداد:\n\nكذلك ورد ذكر المدينه في بعض الاغاني والقصص الفلكلوريَّه المحليَّه والعربيه، كما تغنى بها وبمجدها كبار المغنيين والمغنيات العراقيين والعرب، حيث غنت لها ام كلثوم ومحمد عبد الوهاب وفريد الاطرش وفيروز وكاظم الساهر، وغيرهم.\n\nالسياحه\nتمتاز بغداد بعده معالم سياحيه واثريه مثل المتاحف التي تعرض فيها الاثار المختلفه من جواهر وعملات وهياكل بشريه وتماثيل من عصور ما قبل التاريخ حتى القرن السابع عشر الميلادي. ومن شواهدها الابديه الاثار الاسلاميه التي تتمثل في بقايا سور بغداد ودار الخلافه والمدرسه المستنصريه التي فيها ساعه المدرسه المستنصريه العجيبه ومقر المعتصم ومسجده الشهير وتحتوي على مساجد تاريخيه عديده منها: جامع الخلفاء والذي كان يسمى جامع الخليفه، ومسجد الامام الاعظم ابو حنيفه في الاعظميه، وجامع الاحمديه والذي فيه مدرسه تاريخيه هي مدرسه الاحمديه، ومسجد الامام موسى الكاظم وفيه الحضره الكاظميه، وجامع مرجان في سوق الشورجه، وجامع المنصور وجامع المهدي وجامع الرصافه، بالاضافه لمدارس تاريخيه عريقه كالمدرسه الشرفيه بجوار قبر ابي حنيفه النعمان والمدرسه الموفقيه ومدرسه الاصفيه، والمدرسه القادريه، والمدرسه النظاميه. وتعاني المباني التراثيه لبغداد حاليا من الاهمال والتعدي عليها، خاصه بعد الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003.\nكما تحوي المدينه عدد من المناطق الترفيهيه، مثل مدينه العاب الرصافه، ومدينه العاب الكرخ، وجزيره بغداد السياحيه، متنزه الزوراء، وجزيره الاعراس، والخضراء، وغيرها. هذا بالاضافه الى عدد من النوادي الاجتماعيه مثل: نادي الصيد، نادي الفروسيه، نادي العلويه، ونادي الهنديه، ونادي المنصور .\n\nالرياضه\nيوجد في بغداد عدد من ملاعب كره القدم القديمه، وعدد من الصالات الرياضيه المُغلقه، التي صمم احداها المعمار العالمي لي كوربوزيه. وقد تم انشاء اول ملاعب المدينه في عام 1966، بعد ان وُضع حجر الاساس في عهد الزعيم عبد الكريم قاسم، حيث يتسع الملعب لخمسين الف متفرج. وهو اكبر ملاعب المدينه الى هذا اليوم. ومن الملاعب الاخرى في المدينه ملعب الجيش، ملعب الزوراء، وملعب القوه الجويه. كما تحوي كليه التربيه الرياضيه على عدد من المنشات الرياضيه الكبيره داخل حرم جامعه بغداد.\nيُشار بالذكر الى ان العمل جارِ على تنفيذ مدينه رياضيه في منطقه التاجي شمال بغداد، تبلغ مساحتها مايقارب 500 دونم، وتشمل الملعب الاولمبي الرئيسي الذي يتسع لستين الف متفرج، وثلاثه ملاعب للتدريب، اثنان منها في الجانبين الجنوبي والشمالي من الموقع سعه كل واحد منهما 500 متفرج والثالث يتسع لـ 5000 متفرج.\nلقد عانى القطاع الرياضي في العراق من الاهمال والعقوبات الدوليه بعد الحروب المتتاليه التي شهدتها البلاد، وخصوصا الغزو الامريكي للعراق. وقد كان للمنتخب العراقي لكره القدم اول مبارياته الدوليه على ارضه منذ 2003 مع نظيره الفلسطيني في مدينتيّ بغداد واربيل عام 2009، حيث شكل هذا الحدث، مؤشرًا هامًا لعوده الحياه الطبيعيه الى العراق.\n\nالصحه\nتاسس في بغداد عام 1973 احد اكبر الصروح الطبيه في منطقه الشرق الاوسط، وهو مدينه الطب، حيث تضم بين دفتيها خمسه مستشفيات كبرى، هي دار التمريض الخاص، والجراحات التخصصيه، وامراض الجهاز الهضمي والكبد، وبغداد التعليمي، وحمايه الاطفال. وجميعها في مجال الطوارئ تعتمد على طوارئ مستشفى بغداد التعليمي الذي يحتوي على قسم للطوارئ يضم اكبر قاعتين لطوارئ الباطنيه والجراحيه (عدا حمايه الاطفال) فضلا عن الاحالات من المستشفيات الاخرى واسعاف جرحى الانفجارات الذين يحتاجون الى استنفار الجهود وتوفير العلاج اللازم لاسيما تعويضهم بما يحتاجونه من الدم.\nالجدول التالي يظهر اهم المستشفيات الموجوده في بغداد:\n\nمشاكل\nالوضع الامني\n\nشهدت بغداد اسوهً بمعظم مدن العراق، تدهورًا امنيًا كبيرًا كان احد نتائج الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003، والذي لا تزال تعاني منه حتى اليوم. حيث عمِت المدينه مؤخرًا الفوضى والفتن الطائفيه وجرائم القتل المختلفه من تفجيرات انتحاريه وسيارت مفخخه على يد منظمات متشدده.\nالتلوث والعشوائيات\n\nتعاني مدينه بغداد في الوقت الحاضر من النمو السكاني والعمراني المتزايد لا سيما بعد سقوط الحكم البعثي وما شهدته من هجره كبيره سواء اكان من المناطق الريفيه ومن المحافظات الاخرى ومن خارج العراق.\nتُعد المركبات ابرز مسبّبات التلوث في بغداد، مع توقف تنفيذ شبكات الطرق السريعه في المدينه. كما تُعد المناطق الصناعيه المنتشره في المدينه وما تبعثه المصانع والمعامل المختلفه الى الجو من ملوثات من اهم المسببات كذلك. ويوجد في بغداد عدد كبير من الصناعات الملوثه للهواء داخل المدينه، بعضًا منها من الصناعات الكبرى التي يفترض ابعادها الى خارج حدود التصاميم الاساسيه مثل محطه توليد الكهرباء في الدوره ومحطه توليد كهرباء جنوب بغداد. هناك ايضًا سبب اخر لتلوث الهواء في بغداد، وهو العواصف الترابيه التي تهب في اغلب ايام الصيف بسبب عدم وجود مناطق الاحزمه الخضراء حول المدينه وافتقارها الى مناطق خضراء محيطه بالمناطق السكنيه، وكذلك انتشار المولدات الكهربائيه الصغيره باعداد كبيره.\nاما فيما يخص التلوث المائي، فقد عانى نهر دجله الذي يخترق المدينه في السنوات الاخيره من التلوث بشكل كبير. وقد اعلنت وزاره البيئه العراقيه عن ارتفاع نسبه التلوث في النهر بصوره كبيره عند دخول مياهه الى مدينه بغداد، حيث ان عشرات الاف اللترات بالثانيه من مياه الصرف غير الصحي ترمى في النهر.\nالازمات المروريه\n\nتشهد بغداد اختناقات مروريه كبيره بسبب غلق الكثير من الطرق الفرعيه والرئيسيه بكتل كونكريتيه مختلفه الاحجام والاغراض بعد الغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003. ويُعزى وجود هذه الكتل الى الوضع الامني الراهن بالبلد ولحمايه الاسواق واماكن التجمعات من التفجيرات والاعمال المسلحه. كما تعود اسباب الازمات المروريه ايضاً الى قدم تصاميم شوارع المدينه، بالاضافه الى العدد الكبير من المركبات المُسجله مؤخراً، فهناك اكثر من مليون ونصف المليون سياره في المدينه وحدها. كما تؤدي المواكب الدينيه الى اغلاق تام لبعض شوارع المدينه لافساح المجال لمرور مئات الاف الزوار الى المراقد والمساجد الكبرى في المدينه.\nالخدمات\nشهد وضع الخدمات في بغداد تدهورًا كبيرًا بعد الحروب التي خاضها العراق في العقود الاخيره، وخصوصًا حرب الخليج الثانيه عام 1991، والغزو الامريكي للعراق عام 2003، وما تبعه من احداث ادت الى وصول حال الخدمات العامه الى مستويات متدنيه جداً. حيث احتلت بغداد المرتبه الاخيره عالميًا عام 2012، كاسوا مدينه للعيش في العالم بحسب مسح قامت به مجموعه «ميرسل» العالميه لاستشارات الموارد البشريه، التي يقع مقرها في نيويورك. حيث استند التقرير الى الاوضاع التي تعيشها بغداد، من حيث سوء الخدمات العامه، والاضطرابات السياسيه، والاختناقات بالحواجر الكونكريتيه وتراكم القمامه والمباني المهدمه، اضافه الى الانقطاع في التيار الكهربائي، ومشاكل شبكه الصرف الصحي البدائيه، حيث تعاني المدينه من فياضانات كبيره اثناء فصل الشتاء. وياتي هذا التصنيف ايضًا الى جانب تقرير اخر اطلقته منظمه اليونسكو عام 2012، تم بموجبه تصنيف بغداد بالمرتبه الثالثه كاوسخ مدن العالم، وثامن عاصمه على مستوى التلوث البيئي.\n\nمدن شقيقه\nالمدن الشقيقه لبغداد هي:\n\n اذربيجان - باكو \n الاردن - عمّان \n سوريا - دمشق\n لبنان - بيروت

      "summary": "بَغْدَاد هيَ عَاصِمَة جُمْهُوريَّة العِرَاق، ومَرْكَزُ محافظة بَغْدَاد. في عام 2016 بلغَ عَددُ سُكانها حَوالي 8.5 مَليون نَسَمة، مَا يَجعَلها أكبر مَدِينة في العِرَاق وثانِي أكبر مَدِينة في الوَطَنِ العَرَبي بَعْد القَاهِرةِ. وتأتي بالمَرتبة 40 عالميًا من حيث عدد السكان. وتُعد المَدِينة المَركز الاقْتِصَاديّ والإدَاريّ والتَعليمِيّ في الدَّوْلَة.\nبناها الخليفة العباسي أبو جعفر المنصور في القرن الثامن الميلادي واتخذها عاصمةً للدولة العباسية؛ أصبح لبغداد بعدها مكانة عظيمة، فكانت أهم مراكز العلم على تنوعه في العالم وملتقى للعلماء والدارسين لعدة قرون من الزمن. وتمثل بغداد حاليًا حالةً من حالات التتابع المدني في إطار موقع واحد، ففي إطار موقع الرافدين تتابعت العواصم من بابل القديمة إلى سلوقية الإغريقية وطيسفون الفارسية، التي كانت تعرف بمدائن كسرى، ثم بغداد العربية الحالية.\nكانت بغداد أكبر مدينة في العالم لمُعظم فَترة حُكْم بَنو العَباس خلال العصر الذهبي الإسلامي، بِحَيث بلغَ عَدد سُكانها أكثر من مِليون نَسمة. وصلت مدينة بغداد لذروتها في عصر الخليفة العباسي الخامس هارون الرشيد وارتبطت باسمه في روايات ألف ليلة وليلة ذات الشهرة العالمية، حيث باتت عاصمة العالم القديم. وقد فقدت هذه المكانة منذ عام 1258 عندما غزاها المغول والتتار. مع حلول بدايات القرن السادس عشر، تبادل الصفويون والعثمانيون السيطرة على المدينة، حتى انتزعها العثمانيون أخيراً في عام 1535، فظلت تحت حكمهم قرابة 4 قرون. وفي عام 1917، سيطر الإنجليز على المدينة، وقد خضعت كمعظم مناطق العراق الأخرى تحت الانتداب البريطاني، ثم أصبحت عاصمة للمملكة العراقية عام 1921، والجمهورية العراقية عام 1958.\nتكمن أهمية موقع بغداد الجغرافي في توافر المياه وتناقص أخطار الفيضانات، ما أدى بدوره إلى اتساع رقعة المدينة وزيادة نفوذها إلى جانب سهولة اتصالها عبر نهر دجلة بواسطة الجسور التي تربطها عبر جوانب النهر، والذي يخترق مركزها لينصفه إلى جُزْأَين هما الكرخ والرصافة. وتتشكل المدينة اليوم من 27 منطقة، تنقسم بدورها إلى عدة أحياء.\nتمتاز بغداد بأهميتها الثقافية التي تتمثل بوجود عدد كبير من الصروح المهمة كالمتاحف والمدارس التاريخية والمكتبات والمسارح. وتشتهر المدينة بآثارها الإسلامية التي تتمثل ببقايا أسوار مدينة بغداد، ودار الخلافة، والمدرسة المستنصرية. ولبغداد القديمة أسماء عدة كالمدينة المدورة والزوراء ودار السلام.",
