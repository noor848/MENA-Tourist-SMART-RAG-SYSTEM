      "content": "Khartoum, also spelled Khartum, is the capital city of Sudan as well as Khartoum State. With an estimated population of 7.1 million people, Greater Khartoum is the largest urban area in Sudan.\nKhartoum is located at the confluence of the White Nile – flowing north from Lake Victoria – and the Blue Nile, flowing west from Lake Tana in Ethiopia. Divided by these two parts of the Nile, the Khartoum metropolitan area is a tripartite metropolis consisting of Khartoum proper and linked by bridges to Khartoum North (الخرطوم بحري al-Kharṭūm Baḥrī) and Omdurman (أم درمان Umm Durmān) to the west. The place where the two Niles meet is known as al-Mogran or al-Muqran (المقرن; English: \"The Confluence\").\nKhartoum was founded in 1821 by Muhammad Ali Pasha, north of the ancient city of Soba. In 1882 the British Empire took control of the Egyptian government, leaving the administration of Sudan in the hands of the Egyptians. At the outbreak of the Mahdist War, the British attempted to evacuate Anglo-Egyptian garrisons from Sudan but the Siege of Khartoum in 1884 resulted in the capture of the city by Mahdist forces and a massacre of the defending Anglo-Egyptian garrison. In 1898 it was reoccupied by British forces and was the seat of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan's government until 1956.\nIn 1956, the city was designated as the capital of an independent Sudan. Three hostages were killed during the attack on the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum in 1973.\nIn 2008, the Justice and Equality Movement engaged in combat in the city with the Sudanese Armed Forces as part of the War in Darfur. The Khartoum massacre occurred in 2019 during the Sudanese Revolution. Between 2023 and 2025, the city saw extensive combat during the civil war involving the armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), affecting Khartoum International Airport and other critical sites. In 2025, the Sudanese armed forces recaptured Khartoum from the RSF, leaving widespread destruction.\nKhartoum is an economic and trade center in North Africa, with rail lines from Port Sudan and El-Obeid. It is served by Khartoum International Airport with the New Khartoum International Airport under construction. Several national and cultural institutions are in Khartoum and its metropolitan area, including the National Museum of Sudan, the Khalifa House Museum, the University of Khartoum, and the Sudan University of Science and Technology.\n\nEtymology\nThe origin of the word Khartoum is uncertain. Some Scholars posit that the name derives from the Dinka words khar-tuom (Dinka-Bor dialect) or khier-tuom (as is the pronunciation in various Dinka dialects), translating to \"place where rivers meet\". This is supported by historical accounts which place the Dinka homeland in central Sudan (around present-day Khartoum) as recently as the 13th-17th centuries A.D.\nOne folk etymology is that it is derived from Arabic khurṭūm (خرطوم 'trunk' or 'hose'), probably referring to the narrow strip of land extending between the Blue and White Niles. \nCaptain J.A. Grant, who reached Khartoum in 1863 with Captain Speke's expedition, thought the name was most probably from the Arabic qurṭum (قرطم 'safflower', i.e., Carthamus tinctorius), which was cultivated extensively in Egypt for its oil to be used as fuel. Some scholars speculate that the word derives from the Nubian word Agartum, meaning \"the abode of Atum\", Atum being the Nubian and Egyptian god of creation. Other Beja scholars suggest Khartoum is derived from the Beja word hartoom, \"meeting\". Sociologist Vincent J. Donovan notes that in the Nilotic Maa language of the Maasai people, khartoum means \"we have acquired\" and that the geographical location of Khartoum is where Maasai oral tradition claims that the ancestors of the Maasai first acquired cattle.\n\nHistory\n19th century\nIn 1821, Khartoum was established 24 km (15 mi) north of the ancient city of Soba, by Isma'il Kamil Pasha, the third son of Egypt's ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, who had just incorporated Sudan into his realm. Originally, Khartoum served as an outpost for the Egyptian Army. Egypt shifted the seat of the colonial government from Wad Madani to Khartoum in 1823, which became a permanent settlement and underwent rapid development in the next decades. With its elevation to capital status, Khartoum quickly grew into a regional center of trade, serving as a rest area on the caravan route from Ethiopia to Egypt, but also becoming a major focal point for the slave trade.\nA significant change took place in 1854, when most of the city was destroyed by heavy rains and floods. It was rebuilt with houses made out of mud and stones, replacing those made out of thatch and straw. Khartoum also became the seat of several European consulates and the Apostolic Vicariate of Central Africa. European pressure and influence forced Egypt to close the city's public slave market in 1854, although slaves continued to be sold and trafficked in large numbers, specifically from the Blue Nile region and the Nuba Mountains, as well as down the White Nile (the Dinka and Shilluk territories). According to the British explorer Samuel Baker, who visited Khartoum in 1862, slavery was the industry \"that kept Khartoum going as a bustling town\". \nOn 13 March 1884, troops loyal to the Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad began the siege of Khartoum against the Egyptian garrison led by the British General Charles George Gordon. Despite being fortified by trenches and a wall connecting the Blue and White Niles, the city was conquered by the Mahdists on 26 January 1885 and the entire garrison was annihilated. Many of the inhabitants were massacred or enslaved and the survivors were deported to the newly established Omdurman, while Khartoum was largely destroyed and abandoned. \nWith the reconquest of Sudan by Anglo-Egyptian forces in 1898, Khartoum was established as the capital of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Herbert Kitchener became Governor-General of the Sudan in September 1898, and began a programme of reconstruction, Khartoum was rebuilt according to a street plan in the shape of the Union Jack. Khartoum Bahri was established as a garrison comprising a dockyard and a railhead to Egypt, while Omdurman, remained the most populous part and largely kept its old shape. He ordered the mosques of Khartoum rebuilt and guaranteed freedom of religion to all citizens. He also prevented Christian missionaries from trying to proselytize the local Muslims.\n\n20th century\nThe city rapidly grew and developed under British administration. Under Reginald Wingate (1899–1916), the Governor-General's Palace in Khartoum was rebuilt using red bricks, with sandstone used for the corners. The buildings in Khartoum proper were modeled after Victorian architecture, with a distinct Middle Eastern influence as well as Mediterranean-style windows and balconies. The Gordon Memorial College (now the University of Khartoum) was opened in 1903, and a new railway to Port Sudan was completed in 1919. These developments prompted large migration from rural areas, resulting in an increase in the city's population. By 1930, Khartoum was estimated to have a population of over 50,000.\nKhartoum continued to grow after it was declared the capital of the newly independent Republic of Sudan in 1956. Within the following years, the Municipal Stadium, the Khartoum American School and the Bank of Sudan would be established. This large scale development would spurred rural to urban migration, by 1964 Khartoum's population had ballooned to 185,000. In the 1973 census Khartoum would have a population of 334,000 inhabitants.\nIn 1973, the city was the site of a hostage crisis in which members of Black September held 10 hostages at the Saudi Arabian embassy, five of them diplomats. The US ambassador, the US deputy ambassador, and the Belgian chargé d'affaires were murdered. The remaining hostages were released. A 1973 United States Department of State document, declassified in 2006, concluded: \"The Khartoum operation was planned and carried out with the full knowledge and personal approval of Yasser Arafat.\"\nIn 1977, the first oil pipeline between Khartoum and Port Sudan was completed. The Organization of African Unity summit of 18–22 July 1978 was held in Khartoum, during which Sudan was awarded the OAU presidency.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Khartoum was the destination of hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring nations such as Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda. Many Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees assimilated into society, while others settled in large slums on the city's outskirts. Since the mid-1980s, large numbers of refugees from South Sudan and Darfur – fleeing the violence of the Second Sudanese Civil War and Darfur conflict – have settled around Khartoum.\nIn 1991, Osama bin Laden purchased a house in the affluent al-Riyadh neighborhood of the city and another in Soba. He lived there until 1996, when he was banished from the country. Following the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, the United States accused bin Laden's al-Qaeda group and, on 20 August, launched cruise missile attacks on the al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum North. The factory's destruction created diplomatic tension between the U.S. and Sudan. The factory ruins are now a tourist attraction.\nIn November 1991, the government of President Omar al-Bashir sought to remove half the population from the city. The residents, deemed squatters, were mostly southern Sudanese whom the government feared could be potential rebel sympathizers. Around 425,000 people were placed in five \"Peace Camps\" in the desert an hour's drive from Khartoum. The camps were watched over by heavily armed security guards, many relief agencies were banned from assisting, and \"the nearest food was at a market four miles away, a vast journey in the desert heat\". Many residents were reduced to having only burlap sacks as housing. The intentional displacement was part of a large urban renewal plan backed by the housing minister, Sharaf Bannaga.\n\n21st century\nThe sudden death of SPLA head and vice-president of Sudan John Garang in late July 2005, was followed by three days of violent riots in the capital. Order was finally restored after southern Sudanese politicians and tribal leaders sent strong messages to the rioters. The death toll was at least 24, as youths from southern Sudan attacked northern Sudanese and clashed with security forces.\nThe African Union summit of 16–24 January 2006 was held in Khartoum; as was the Arab League summit of 28–29 March 2006, during which they elected Sudan the Arab League presidency.\nOn 10 May 2008, the Darfur rebel group Justice and Equality Movement attacked the city with the goal of toppling Omar al-Bashir's government. The Sudanese government held off the assault.\nOn 23 October 2012, an explosion at the Yarmouk munitions factory killed two people and injured another person. The Sudanese government claimed that the explosion was the result of an Israeli airstrike.\nOn 3 June 2019, Khartoum was the site of the Khartoum massacre, where over 100 dissidents were murdered (the government said 61 were killed), hundreds more injured and 70 women raped by Rapid Support Forces (RSF) soldiers in order to forcefully disperse the peaceful protests calling for a civilian government.\nOn 1 July 2020, activists demanded that al-Zibar Basha street in Khartoum be renamed. Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur was a slave trader and the al-Zibar Basha street leads to the military base where the 2019 Khartoum massacre took place.\nOn 26 October 2021, the city was locked down following a military coup that left at least 7 dead, triggering protests and calls for a general strike. Prime minister Abdalla Hamdok was arrested during the coup, and held along with other cabinet members in an unknown location.\nOn 15 April 2023, fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF broke out across Sudan, including in Khartoum. Fighting was reported at the presidential palace, the RSF's headquarters, Khartoum International Airport and Merowe Airport, which the RSF claimed to have captured. The Sudanese Armed Forces regained full control of Khartoum on 26 March 2025.\n\nGeography\nLocation\nKhartoum is located at the confluence of the Blue Nile and the White Nile. \nKhartoum is relatively flat, at elevation 385 m (1,263 ft), as the Nile flows northeast past Omdurman to Shendi, at elevation 364 m (1,194 ft) about 163 km (101 mi) away.\n\nClimate\nKhartoum features a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with a dry season occurring during winter, typical of the Saharo-Sahelian zone, which marks the progressive passage between the Sahara Desert's vast arid areas and the Sahel's vast semi-arid areas. The climate is extremely dry for most of the year, with about eight months when average rainfall is lower than 5 mm (0.20 in). The very long dry season is itself divided into a warm, very dry season between November and February, as well as a very hot, dry season between March and May. During this part of the year, hot, dry continental trade winds from deserts, such as the harmattan, sweep over the region; the weather is stable and very dry.\nThe very irregular, very brief, rainy season lasts about 1 month as the maximum rainfall is recorded in August, with about 48 mm (1.9 in). The rainy season is characterized by a seasonal reverse of wind regimes, when the Intertropical Convergence Zone goes northerly. Average annual rainfall is very low, with only 121.3 mm (4.78 in) of precipitation. Khartoum records on average six days with 10 mm (0.39 in) or more and 19 days with 1 mm (0.039 in) or more of rainfall. The highest temperatures occur during two periods in the year: the first at the late dry season, when average high temperatures consistently exceed 40 °C (104 °F) from April to June, and the second at the early dry season, when average high temperatures exceed 39 °C (102 °F) in September and October. Temperatures cool off somewhat during the night, with Khartoum's lowest average low temperature of the year, in January, just above 15 °C (59 °F). Khartoum is one of the hottest major cities on Earth, with annual mean temperatures hovering around 30 °C (86 °F). The city also has very warm winters. In no month does the average monthly high temperature fall below 30 °C (86 °F). This is something not seen in other major cities with hot desert climates, such as Riyadh, Baghdad and Phoenix.\n\nDemographics\nAlmost 250,000 Syrians lived in Khartoum as of 2019, representing 5% of the total population of the city. Most are young men who have fled war in Syria. Sudan was the only country in the world to accept travelers carrying a Syrian passport who lacked a visa.\n\nEconomy\nAfter the signing of the historic Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLA), the Government of Sudan began a massive development project. In 2007, the biggest projects in Khartoum were the Al-Mogran Development Project, two five-star hotels, a new airport, El Mek Nimr Bridge (finished in October 2007) and the Tuti Bridge that links Khartoum to Tuti Island.\nIn the 21st century, Khartoum developed based on Sudan's oil wealth (although the independence of South Sudan in 2011 affected the economy of Sudan negatively). The center of the city has tree-lined streets. Khartoum has the highest concentration of economic activity in the country. This has changed as major economic developments take place in other parts of the country, like oil exploration in the south, the Giad Industrial Complex in Al Jazirah state and White Nile Sugar Project in Central Sudan, and the Merowe Dam in the North.\nAmong the city's industries are printing, glass manufacturing, food processing, and textiles. Petroleum products are now produced in the far north of Khartoum state, providing fuel and jobs for the city. One of Sudan's largest refineries is located in northern Khartoum.\n\nRetailing\nThe Souq al Arabi is Khartoum's largest open air market. The souq is spread over several blocks in the center of Khartoum proper just south of the Great Mosque (Mesjid al-Kabir) and the minibus station. It is divided into separate sections, including one focused entirely on gold.\nAl Qasr Street and Al Jamhoriyah Street are considered the most famous high streets in Khartoum State.\nAfra Mall is located in the southern suburb of Arkeweet. The Afra Mall has a supermarket, retail outlets, coffee shops, a bowling alley, movie theaters, and a children's playground.\nIn 2011, Sudan opened the Hotel Section and part of the food court of the new, Corinthia Hotel Tower. The Mall/Shopping section is still under construction.\n\nEducation\nKhartoum is the main location for most of Sudan's top educational bodies. There are four main levels of education:\n\nKindergarten and day-care. It begins in the age of 3–4, consisting of 1-2 grades, (depending on the parents).\nElementary school. The first grade pupils enter at the age of 6–7. It consists of 8 grades, after which, at 13–14 years old, students are ready to take the certificate exams and enter high school.\nUpper second school and high school. In these three the school methods add some main academic subjects such as chemistry, biology, physics, and geography. There are three grades in this level. The students' ages are about 14–15 to 17–18.\nHigher education. There are several universities and colleges in Khartoum, including the University of Khartoum and Sudan University of Science and Technology.\n\nTransportation\nKhartoum is home to the largest airport in Sudan, Khartoum International Airport. It is the main hub for Sudan Airways, Sudan's main carrier. A new airport was planned for the southern outskirts of the city, but with Khartoum's rapid growth and consequent urban sprawl, the airport is still located in the heart of the city.\nKhartoum's transportation is limited to the vehicular road system, with buses and personal vehicles comprising the main types of vehicles. As with many cities in the continent, parts of Khartoum are connected through privately owned buses.\n\nKhartoum has a number of bridges across both tributaries of the Nile. The Mac Nimir Bridge, the Blue Nile Road & Railway Bridge, the Cooper Bridge (also known as the Armed Forces Bridge), and the Elmansheya Bridge span the Blue Nile, connecting Khartoum to Khartoum North. The Omdurman Bridge, the Victory Bridge, and the Al-Dabbasin Bridge span the White Nile, connecting Khartoum to Omdurman. The Tuti Bridge connects Tuti Island with Khartoum. Prior to the construction of the Tuti Bridge in 2008, residents of Tuti Island relied on water taxis to cross the Blue Nile into Khartoum.\nKhartoum has rail lines from Wadi Halfa, Port Sudan on the Red Sea, and El Obeid. All are operated by Sudan Railways.\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of Khartoum reflects the city's history since the early 1820s and is marked by both native Sudanese, Turkish, British and modern buildings. In general, the architecture of Sudan reflects a wide diversity in its shapes, materials, and use.\nSince independence, the people of Sudan have introduced new infrastructure and technology, which has led to new and innovative building concepts, ideas and construction techniques.\n\nCulture\nMuseums\nThe largest museum in Sudan is the National Museum of Sudan. Founded in 1971, it contains works from different epochs of Sudanese history. Among the exhibits are two Egyptian temples of Buhen and Semna, originally built by Pharaoh Hatshepsut and Pharaoh Tuthmosis III, respectively, but relocated to Khartoum upon the flooding of Lake Nasser.\nThe Republican Palace Museum, opened in 2000, is located in the former Anglican All Saints' cathedral on Sharia al-Jama'a, next to the historical Presidential Palace.\nThe Ethnographic Museum is located on Sharia al-Jama'a, close to the Mac Nimir Bridge.\n\nBotanical gardens\nKhartoum is home to one of the oldest botanical gardens in Africa, National Botanical Garden in the Mogran district of the city.\n\nClubs\nKhartoum is home to several clubs, including the Blue Nile Sailing Club, social clubs such as the German Club, the Greek Club, the Coptic Club, the Syrian Club and the International Club, as well as football clubs Al Khartoum SC and Al Ahli Khartoum.\n\nPlaces of worship\nThe places of worship in Khartoum primarily consist of Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples: Coptic Orthodox Church, St. Matthew's Cathedral, Khartoum, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Khartoum (Catholic Church), Sudan Interior Church (Baptist World Alliance), the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation and Presbyterian Church in Sudan (World Communion of Reformed Churches).\n\nIn popular culture\nLiterature\nKhartoum's unique history and cultural significance have inspired literary works that explore its past, present, and future. For example, in \"Reading Khartoum\", the city is depicted as a space shaped by movement, political instability, and socio-cultural changes, resulting in underlying layers of meanings and ambiguity. Arabic-written poetry also offers a personalized glimpse of the city, reflecting its distinct cultural appearance and setting it apart from other Arab and African cities.\n\nMovies\nSong of Khartoum (1955)\nKhartoum (1966 film) (1966)\nKhartoum Offside (2019)\n\nNotable people\nSara Berkai, Eritrean and British social enterprise founder and STEM educator, born in Khartoum\n\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nKidnapped, tortured and thrown in jail: my 70 days in Sudan The Guardian, 2017\nWerner, Louis (April 2018). \"Khartoum: A Tale of Two Rivers\".

      "content": "الْخَرْطُوْم هيَ عاصمه السُّودان وحاضره ولايه الخرطُوم، تقع عند نقطه التقاء النّيل الابيض بالنّيل الازرق (المقرن)، ليُشكلا معاً نهر النيل. وهي مركز الحكم في السُّودان حيث يوجد فيها مقر رئيس الجمهوريه والحكومه، ورئاسه الوزارات المركزيه المختلفه وقياده القوات المسلحه السودانيه والبعثات الدبلوماسيه الاجنبيه من سفارات وقنصليات، ومقر بعض المنظمات الاقليميه العربيه والافريقيه ومعظم المؤسسات السياسيه للدوله. وهي قلب افريقيا بالنسبه لخطوط الطيران، وذلك لمرور خطوط الطيران التي تقطع شمال القاره تجاه جنوبها وتلك التي تمر عبر غرب القاره وشرقها. يوجد بالمدينه العديد من الجامعات والكليات الحكوميه والخاصه والمؤسسات التعليميه المختلفه ورئاسات الشركات والبنوك الوطنيه وفروع الشركات الاجنبيه.\nيرجع تاريخ تاسيس الخرطوم كعاصمه، الى العقود الاولى من القرن التاسع عشر اثناء فتره الحكم العثماني المصري في السودان حيثُ اتخذت عاصمه للبلاد، الا ان تاريخها كموقع استيطان بشري ابعد من ذلك بكثير فقد سكنها الانسان منذ العصر الحجري، كما كان موقعها موطن حضاره قديمه عُرفت بمملكه علوه وشهد القَرن الماضي اول مرحله من مراحل ازدهارها عندما شُيّدت العماره في العهد البريطاني المصري على النسق المعماري الانجليزي والذي لا يزال ماثلاً للعيان في الابنيه القديمه بجامعه الخرطوم ومبنى وزاره الماليه ومصلحه البريد والبرق وبعض المرافق الحكوميه المطله على النيل وتحول بعضها الى متاحف مفتوحه للجمهور، وفي بعض الجسور القديمه المقامه على نهر النيل والتي تربطها بما يحيط بها من مناطق حضريه. يبلغ عدد سكان مدينه الخرطوم 2,682,431 نسمه، وهي بذلك سادس مدينه من حيث عدد السكان في افريقيا (ولا يشمل الرقم باقي سكان العاصمه المثلثه البالغ عددهم 5,172,000 تقريباً) ويمثل سكانها مختلف الاثنيات والمجموعات السكانيه من داخل السودان وخارجه بالاضافه الى اعداد كبيره من اللاجئين وغيرهم من الوافدين السياسيين، والمناخ في الخرطوم معتدل في فصل الشتاء مع ارتفاع في درجات الحراره في الصيف وهطول امطار غزيره في موسم الخريف، وتتميز المدينه بموقعها الاستراتيجي في وسط السودان حيث التقاء النيل الازرق بالنيل الابيض، الذي جعل منها منطقه جذب سياحي تزخر بالمعالم الطبيعيه والاثريه، ومحور نقل واتصالات محليّه واقليميه.\n\nالخرطوم الكبرى\nيتعين التمييز بين الخرطوم العاصمه القوميه او  العاصمه المثلثه كما يطلق عليها احياناً، والخرطوم الولايه، وبينهما وبين الخرطوم المدينه، او الخرطوم عموم كما تسمى. ويقصد بالعاصمه المثلثه التجمع الميتروبوليتي المتكوّن من المدن الثلاث التي تنتشر فيها المصالح والدواوين الحكوميه وترتبط مع بعضها البعض جغرافياً وادارياً واجتماعياً، وهي الخرطوم عموم الواقعه على الضفه الجنوبيه والغربيه للنيل الازرق والضفه الشرقيه للنيل الابيض، والمدينه الثانيه هي ام درمان وتقع على الضفه الغربيه للنيل الابيض ونهر النيل اي المجرى الذي يتكون من النيلين الازرق والابيض بعد التقائهما عند نقطه المقرن. والمدينه الثالثه هي الخرطوم بحري (اي الخرطوم شمال، كما تسمى باللغه الانجليزيه. لفظ بحري باللهجه المصريه يرادف لفظ شمال بالفصحى) وتقع على الضفه الشماليه للنيل الازرق والضفه الشرقيه لنهر النيل. واما الخرطوم الولايه، اي ولايه الخرطوم فهذه تشمل المدن الثلاث وضواحيها وبعض المناطق المحيطه بها وهي احدى ولايات السودان.\n\nاصل التسميه\nاختلفت الروايات حول سبب تسميه المدينه بهذا الاسم وحول اصل التسميه ومعنى اللفظ. فهناك من يقول بان التسميه ترجع الى شكل قطعه الارض التي تقع عليها المدينه والتي يشقها نهري النيل ويلتقيان فيها مع بعضهما في شكل انحنائي يرسمان بينهما قطعه ارض اشبه بخرطوم الفيل وهو الراي الراجح،\nالا ان الرحاله البريطاني كابتن جيمس جرانت الذي رافق الكابتن جون اسبيك في رحلته الاستكشافيه لمنابع النيل ذكر بان الاسم مشتق من زهره القرطم التي كانت تزرع بكثافه في المنطقه لتصديرها الى مصر لاستخراج الزيت منها للاناره وقد استخدمها الرومان عند غزوهم لمصر ووصولهم الى شمال السودان حيث عثروا على زهره القرطم في موقع الخرطوم الحالي واستخدموا الزيت المستخرج من حبوبها في علاج جروح جنودهم. وهناك ايضاً تفسيرات اخرى للاسم لا سند لها مثل «خور التوم» نسبه الى شخص يدعى التوم.\nوالخرطوم في اللغه هو الانف من الانسان، حيث قال تعالى: (اِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِ ءاياتُنَا قَالَ اَسَاطِيرُ الاَوَّلِينَ سَنَسِمُهُ عَلَى الْخُرْطُومِ)،(قران كريم، سوره القلم، ايه 15، 16) اي سوف نجعل له الوسم بالسواد على انفه، وقيل على وجهه فيكون له وسمه. وقال قتاده سنسمه على الخرطوم بمعنى ان نضع سيما على انفه. والمعنى من الايات هو الوليد بن المغيره.\nوالخرطوم هو ايضاً اسم لانف السبع او الفيل وهو ما يتماشى لغوياُ مع معنى تسميه الخرطوم.\n\nالتاريخ\nاُسست الخرطوم كمدينه على يد الجيش العثماني في عهد محمد علي باشا عندما ارسل جيشه لضم السودان الى مُلكه بقياده ابنه الثالث اسماعيل كامل باشا عام 1821م، واتخذها الاتراك في البدايه معسكراً لجيوشهم ثم تحولت الى عاصمه لهم في عهد عثمان جركس باشا البرنجي عام 1824م وذلك بعد تعيينه حكمدارا (حاكماً) على السودان خلفا للحكمدار محمد بك خسرو الدفتردار.\n\nالتاريخ القديم\nيعود تاريخ الخرطوم كمستوطنه بشريه الى عصور سحيقه حيث اكدت المستحثات على ان الانسان قد استوطن في موقع الخرطوم الحالي منذ سنه 400 قبل الميلاد، وتم العثور على ادوات تعود الى العصر الحجري في منطقه خور ابو عنجه في مدينه ام درمان الحاليه القريبه من الخرطوم، اضافه الى بقايا اثريه لمستوطنات يرجع تاريخها الى عهد مملكتي نبته ومروي في الفتره من 750 قبل الميلاد الى 350 بعد الميلاد.\nوتقول مصادر اخرى ترجع في تاريخها الى القرن السادس عشر الميلادي بان المكان الذي تقوم عليه الان الخرطوم كان عباره عن احراش وغابات، وكان يبعد عن مدينه سوبا عاصمه مملكه علوه، احدى الممالك المسيحيه القديمه في السودان، حوالي 24 كيلومتر (15 ميل). وفي القرن السادس عشر قام سكان جزيره توتي التي تقع في مجري نهر النيل المقابل للمكان - وكانوا ينتمون الى قبيله (المحس) النوبيه - بزراعه المكان، قبل ان يقيم فيه احد فقهائهم ويدعى الشيخ ارباب العقائد مدرسه لتعليم القران ويتحول تدريجياً الى منطقه سكنيه.\n\nالممالك المسيحيه\nورد ذكر سوبا باعتبارها عاصمه لمملكه علوه وهي الان المنطقه الجنوبيه للخرطوم في كتب عدد من الرحاله العرب والمسلمين، فقد ذكرها اليعقوبي بقوله «والمملكه الثانيه من النوبه الذين يقال لهم علوه وفي سنه 360 هجريه (970، ميلاديه) زار منطقه الخرطوم احمد بن حوقل، ودون في كتابه صوره الارض انه تجول في منطقه سوبا وذكر بان بها جماعه من المسلمين، كما وصف منطقه النيل الابيض وقال: «من وراء النيل نهر عظيم يسمى بحر ابيض سكانه جنس من النوبه» وصف ابن حوقل سوبا بانها «اوسع من الحبشه وعمارتها اكثر مما بالحبشه، ويخترق نيل مصر فيما بين مدنهم ونواحيهم. وقراهم عامره خصبه كثيره التمر والزرع والخضر. ومن اعمر بلادهم نواحي علوه وهي ناحيه لها قرى متصله وعمارات مشتبكه حتى ان السائر ليجتاز في الرحله الواحده بقرى عده غير متقطعه الحدود، ذوات مياه متصله بسواق من النيل»، كذلك كتب عنها ابن سليم الاسواني في القرن العاشر الميلادي وقال ان «المسافه ما بين دنقله الى اول بلد علوه، اكثر مما بينها واسوان. وفي ذلك من القرى والضياع والجزائر والمواشي والنخل والشجر والمقل الزرع والكرم، اضعاف ما في الجانب الذي يلي ارض الاسلام.. ومتملك علوه اكثر مالاً من متملك المقره واعظم جيشاً، وعنده من الخيل ما ليس عند المقرى، وبلده اخصب واوسع»، اما ابو صالح الارمني فقد ذكر عن سوبا بان «بها جيش ومملكه عظيمه جداً واعمال متسعه، وبها اربعمائه كنيسه. وهذه المدينه في شرقي الجزيره الكبيره بين البحرين الابيض والاخضر، وجميع من بها نصارى يعاقبه، حولها ديارات متباعده من البحر، ومنها ما هو على البحر، وبها كنيسه عظيمه جداً متسعه محكمه الوضع والبناء» هذه الكتابات تدل على ان منطقه الخرطوم كانت منطقه حضاره مزدهره ابان العصر المسيحي في السودان، وقبل تخريبها من قبل جحافل الفونج حتى اصبح «خراب سوبا» مضرب امثال شعبيه في السودان.\nولا يعرف الكثير عن الخرطوم في عصر الفونج الذين اسسوا مُلكهم في السودان بتحالف مع قبائل العبدلاب واقاموا عاصمتهم في سنار، سوى استمرار مدارسها وخلاويها القرانيه في تدريس علوم الدين وابرزها مدرسه اسلانج القرانيه بجزيره اسلانج الواقعه في شمال مدينه الخرطوم وقد تاسس بها اول مسجد هو مسجد حمد النجيض الجموعي في عهد عجيب المانجلك واشتهرت بتعليم القران وتوافد اتباع الطريقه القادريه احدى الطرق الصوفيه الرئيسيه في السودان.\n\nالعهد العثماني (1821- 1885)\nيبدا التاريخ الحديث لمدينه الخرطوم مع مجيء الجيش العثماني لاياله مصر الى السودان بقياده اسماعيل كامل باشا ابن محمد علي باشا خديوي مصر، والذي حط رحاله عليها وهو في طريقه الى سنار عاصمه السلطنه الزرقاء التي كانت تحكم تلك المناطق في عام 1821م، واقام فيها معسكراً لجنوده على بعد ميل واحد (1,6 كيلومتر) من ضفه النهر وفي منطقه السكه الحديديه الحاليه، ولكنه اختار اولاً مدينه ود مدني الواقعه بين سنار والخرطوم عاصمه جديده للبلاد. ولم يطب المقام للاتراك في مدينه ود مدني بسبب مناخها الجاف، ولذلك عندما جاء الاميرالاي عثمان جركس باشا البرنجي، الذي عُيّن حاكماً على السودان (1823 - 1825) م ومر على ملتقى النيلين (الازرق والابيض) وهو في طريقه الى العاصمه ود مدني اُعجِب بالمكان وبقي في معسكر الخرطوم ثم امر ببناء الثكنات والقلاع فيه. فقرر ابراهيم باشا، ابن محمد علي باشا خديوي مصر، الانتقال الى الخرطوم القديمه واتخاذها عاصمه للسودان.\nبدا الاتراك في بناء المدينه على طراز معماري جديد فشيدت المباني من الطوب الاجر واُقيمت مباني الادارات. وشهدت المدينه توسعاً في عهد خورشيد باشا حكمدار السودان في سنه 1826 م، وفي عام 1850 امر الخديوي عباس بانشاء مدرسه الخرطوم بينما قام الحكمدار عبد اللطيف 1849 - 1851 م بتاسيس حي «الحكمداريه» ليكون مجمعاً لمباني الاداره العثمانيه ومساكن للقاده. وفي عهد الحكمدار اسماعيل ايوب 1873 - 1877 م وُضِعت لبنات الصناعه في الخرطوم عندما تم تشييد معمل لصناعه الورق واخر للبارود. وفي فتره الجنرال غوردون باشا حاكم عام السودان الانجليزي المصري تم بناء «بوابه المسلميه» وكانت تقع في مكان كوبري (جسر) المسلميه الحالي، جنوب مستشفى الخرطوم، فوق خط السكه الحديديه، و«بوابه الكلاكله» وكان موقعها مكان كوبري الحريه الحالي، الذي تم تشييده ابّان عهد الرئيس ابراهيم عبود في مطلع ستينات القرن الماضي.\nوورد في كتاب تاريخ الخرطوم للمؤرخ السوداني محمد ابراهيم ابو سليم بان اهم احياء الخرطوم في العهد العثماني شملت حي الحكمداريه، حيث مركز الحكم، وحي المسجد، والاحياء الشعبيه في اطراف المدينه التي كان يسكنها عامه الناس، ومنها حي سلامه الباشا، وحي هبوب ضرباني، وحي الكاره، وحي الترس، الذي اخذ اسمه من الحواجز الترابيه التي اقيمت جنوبه لحمايه المدينه من فيضان نهر النيل الابيض، وحي بري المحس (وهو الحي الوحيد الذي لا يزال محافظاً على اسمه ولكنه تم تغيير مكانه الى موقع اخر ليفسح المجال لبناء ثكنات الجيش البريطاني في فتره لاحقه (1900) والتي تحولت بعد الاستقلال (1956) الى مباني داخليات لطلاب جامعه الخرطوم.\n\nعهد الدوله المهديه (1885- 1898)\nعاشت الخرطوم فتره تاريخيه عصيبه منذ بدايه الثوره المهديه باعتبارها مقر حكم الغزاه. وكان من المتوقع ان تزحف اليها قوات المهدي المناوئه للحكم العثماني في السودان ووكيله خديوي مصر، في اي وقت بعد ان حققت انتصارات باهره على القوات العثمانيه في مختلف مدن السودان، اخرها كان الانتصار الكبير على الجنرال الانجليزي وليام هكس باشا في سنه 1883 م في واقعه شيكان القريبه من مدينه الابيض على بعد 588 كيلومتر (365 ميل)، حيث طلب المهدي من احد انصاره في منطقه الخرطوم وهو الشيخ محمد الطيب البصير بمحاصره المدينه، وارسل اليه قوات مسانده بقياده الامير محمد عثمان ابو قرجه، وبوصول مدد اخر من القوات يقوده الامير عبد الرحمن النجومي، تمكن الانصار من احكام حصارهم للخرطوم، وضاقت الحلقه حولها بوصول المهدي نفسه والذي عسكر بجيشه في منطقه ابو سعد بام درمان سنه 1884 م، قبل ان يدخلها منتصراً في 26 يناير / كانون الثاني 1885 م. وتقول المصادر البريطانيه، بان الخرطوم تعرضت لدمار كبير من قبل قوات الدراويش الفاتحه والتي تمكنت من دك حصون الاتراك ووقع غوردون باشا صريعاً في قصره المطل على النيل الازرق، الا ان مصادر المهديه تؤكد بان خليفه المهدي عبد الله التعايشي امر بعدم تخريب الخرطوم وعدم نقل مواد البناء منها الى ام درمان، وان المهدي قد غضب شديداً عندما علم بمقتل غوردون على يد قواته لانه كان يريد القبض عليه حيّاً واسره.\nاقام كبار انصار المهدي من امراء وقاده في قصور الدوله وبيوت الاعيان في حي المسجد بينما اقام المهدي في قصر يسمى «قصر الجاركوك» وكان قريباً من المسجد، وسكن الخليفه عبد الله التعايشي في سراي الحكمدار، اما اهالي الخرطوم فقد تم جمعهم في الطرف الجنوبي من المدينه، ولم تستمر اقامه قاده المهديه طويلاً في الخرطوم حيث انتقلوا الى ام درمان التي اتخذوها مقراً جديدا للحكم في السودان في مايو / ايار من عام 1885 م.\n\nالحكم الثنائي (1898- 1956)\nفقدت الخرطوم مركزها كعاصمه للبلاد في عهد المهديه بعد ان اختار المهدي مدينه ام درمان الواقعه على الضفه الاخرى من نهر النيل عاصمه للدوله، فاقيمت بها منشات ودوواين الحكم من بيت مال وثكنات للجيش وسور لحمايتها وغير ذلك. وفي تلك الفتره عانت الخرطوم من الاهمال الحكومي، وانتقلت التجاره والصناعه التقليديه الى العاصمه الجديده، الا ان هزيمه الدروايش في معركه كرري في ديسمبر / كانون الاول عام 1898م، وخروج الخليفه عبد الله التعايشي من ام درمان اعاد الروح مجدداً الى الخرطوم حيث قامت القوات البريطانيه المصريه بقياده اللورد كيتشنر باعاده بناء المدينه باعتبارها العاصمه الرسميه للحكم الثنائي عام 1899 م، وقُدِمت عده تصاميم هندسيه لبناء الخرطوم الجديده «الانجلو-مصريه».\nوشهدت الخرطوم فتره استقرار سياسي واجتماعي حتى وقعت حادثه اغتيال السير سير لي استاك حاكم عام السودان في القاهره حيث قررت انجلترا طرد الجيش المصري من السودان في ظرف اربعه وعشرين ساعه واجلاء الموظفين المدنيين المصريين وذلك كرد فعل انتقامي على حادثه الاغتيال لتنفرد انجلترا بحكم السودان مما اثار رد فعل عنيف وسط السودانيين الذين خرجوا في مظاهرات بقياده جمعيه اللواء الابيض التي كان يراسها الضابط السوداني علي عبد اللطيف والذي القي عليه القبض وادُخل السجن، وادى ذلك بدوره الى تاجيج حاله الاستياء وسط سكان الخرطوم. وفي 27 نوفمبر / تشرين الثاني 1924 م تمردت وحده عسكريه تابعه لقوه دفاع السودان الخاضعه للحكومه الاستعماريه. وكان يقود الوحده الضابط السوداني عبد الفضيل الماظ. تحركت الوحده من الخرطوم في اتجاه مدينه الخرطوم بحري الواقعه على الضفه الشماليه لنهر النيل الازرق واعترضتها قوه انجليزيه في موقع قريب من جسر النيل الازرق الذي يربط بين المدينتين واندلعت معركه سقط فيها العشرات من الجانبين واحدثت موجه من الهلع وسط السكان الذين فرت اعداد منهم الى الاحراش المحيطه بالمدينه وتمكنت القوه الانجليزيه من القضاء على تمرد الجنود والضباط السودانيين وذلك بمحاصره الضابط عبد الفضيل الماظ في مستشفى الخرطوم وقصفه بالمدافع الثقيله. وعرفت تلك الاحداث في السودان بثوره 1924.\nوفي اثناء الحرب العالميه الثانيه ابّان حمله شرق افريقيا، دخلت الخرطوم في اتون الصراع بين مجموعه دول الحلفاء في الحرب العالميه الثانيه ومجموعه ما يسمى بدول المحور ممثله بايطاليا التي كانت تحتل الحبشه واريتريا والصومال الايطالي. وفي 23 اغسطس / اب 1940 م، اغارت طائره حربيه ايطاليه على الخرطوم تلتها غاره جويه اخرى في اليوم التالي على ام درمان ادت الى مصرع 3 اشخاص وفي 10 سبتمبر / ايلول من العام ذاته القت طائره حربيه ايطاليه بقنابلها على مشارف الخرطوم.\nبانتصار الحلفاء طلب السودانيون من انجلترا الوفاء بوعدها لهم بمنح السودان حق تقرير المصير وبدات حكومتا الحكم الثنائي في مناقشه هذه المطالب مع الاحزاب السودانيه وبعد استيلاء الضباط الاحرار على السلطه في مصر واختيار اللواء محمد نجيب رئيساً مجلس قياده الثوره المصريه، جاء محمد نجيب الى الخرطوم - وهو من مواليدها - لافتتاح البرلمان السوداني الجديد الذي سيتولى مهمه الاقتراع على استقلال السودان او وحدته مع مصر. وشهدت الخرطوم ابّان زيارته احداثاً داميه في مطار الخرطوم الدولي عندما اصطدمت اعداد كبيره من المؤيدين للاستقلال التام للسودان وسقط عدد من القتلى والجرحى وعُرفت تلك الحوادث بحوادث مارس 1954.\nوفي يوم الاحد اول يناير / كانون الثاني شهدت الخرطوم احتفالات حاشده حيث تم رفع علم الاستقلال على ساريه سرايا الحاكم العام التي تغيّر اسمها الى القصر الجمهوري.\n\nالتاريخ المعاصر\nفي الفتره التي تلت استقلال السودان في عام 1956م شهدت الخرطوم عده احداث وفعاليات سياسيه وطنيه واقليميه ودوليه، فالى جانب قيامها بدور العاصمه السياسيه للسودان ومقراً للحكم فقد استضافت عدداً من المنظمات الاقليميه التي تم ابرام اتفاقيات انشائها في السودان واصبحت مدينه الخرطوم مقراً لها. ففي فبراير / شباط 1957، تم تاسيس الاتحاد الافريقي لكره القدم في الخرطوم التي كانت اول مقر له قبل انتقال المقر الى القاهره وفي الخرطوم تم تنظيم اول بطوله لكاس الامم الافريقيه. وفي فبراير / شباط 1969، تم انشاء اتحاد اذاعات الدول العربيه في الخرطوم وانعقدت في التاريخ نفسه اول جلسه لجمعيته العامه في الخرطوم. وفي 11 مارس / اذار 1970 تم انشاء المنظمه العربيه للتنميه الزراعيه لتكون المدينه مقراً لها. وفي الشهر ذاته من عام 1975 بدا المصرف العربي للتنميه الاقتصاديه في افريقيا اعماله انطلاقاً منها وفي ابريل / نيسان تم في الخرطوم الاعلان عن انشاء منظمه الاحزاب السياسيه الافريقيه.\nوفي نوفمبر / تشرين الاول 1976 م، تاسست في الخرطوم الهيئه العربيه للاستثمار والانماء الزراعي.\nكما شهدت الخرطوم انعقاد عده مؤتمرات قمه عربيه وافريقيه مهمه حيث انعقد فيها في عام 1967 م، مؤتمر القمه العربي الرابع المعروف باسم قمه اللاءات الثلاثه، وفي عام 2006 م، مؤتمر القمه العربيه الثامنه عشره كما انعقد فيها مؤتمران للقمه الافريقيه احدهما في عام 1978 والاخر في عام 2006 الى جانب انعقاد مؤتمرات اخرى على مستوى وزاري مثل مؤتمر وزراء دفاع وقاده دول شرق افريقيا في عام 2012 م.\nفي عام 1973، كانت المدينه مسرحاً لازمه رهائن عندما قامت مجموعه تابعه لمنظمه ايلول الاسود الفلسطينيه باقتحام حفل استقبال كان يقيمه عميد السلك الدبلوماسي بالخرطوم سفير المملكه العربيه السعوديه لوداع مستشار بالسفاره الامريكيه واحتجاز عدد من المدعوين وتقدمت بمطالب لم تتم الاستجابه لها، ومن بينها اطلاق سراح احد رفاقها من السجون الاردنيه فقامت باغتيال السفير الامريكي الجديد انذاك ومستشار السفاره المحتفى به، والقائم بالاعمال البلجيكي، وافرجت عن الرهائن الاخرين بمن فيهم السفير السعودي والسفير الاردني ثم استسلمت للسلطات السودانيه التي قامت باعتقال افرادها وسلمتهم لاحقاُ لمنظمه التحرير الفلسطينيه.\nوفي سبعينيات وثمانينيات القرن الماضي استقبلت الخرطوم موجات متعاقبه من اللاجئين والنازحين والمهجرين، الوافدين من مناطق النزاعات المسلحه والجفاف في البلدان المجاوره مثل تشاد واريتريا واثيوبيا واوغندا افلح بعضهم في الاندماج في مجتمعها، في حين اقام البعض الاخر في احياء بضواحي المدينه. وفي منتصف الثمانينيات استقرت حول الخرطوم اعداد كبيره من السودانيين النازحين من مناطق الصراع في جنوب السودان ودار فور\nوفي يوم 14 اغسطس / اب 1994 م، تم في الخرطوم اعتقال الفنزويلي كارلوس الملقب بابن اوى والمطلوب من قبل السلطات الامنيه في عدد من الدول الغربيه وتم نقله من الخرطوم الى باريس.\nاقام اسامه بن لادن في حي الرياض بالخرطوم في الفتره من عام 1991 وحتى 1996 م، قبل ان يتم ابعاده منها. وفي اعقاب تفجيرات السفاره الامريكيه في كل من كمبالا ودار السلام في عام 1998 م، اتهمت الولايات المتحده تنظيم القاعده الذي كان يتزعمه بمسؤوليه التفجيرات وقامت في 20 اغسطس / اب من العام نفسه بشن هجمات بصواريخ كروز على مصنع الشفاء للادويه بمدينه الخرطوم بحري القريبه من الخرطوم مما ادى الى توتر دبلوماسي بينها وبين السودان، واصبحت انقاض المصنع منطقه جذب سياحي.\nاحدثت الوفاه المفاجئه لرئيس الحركه الشعبيه لتحرير السودان ونائب الرئيس السوداني انذاك جون قرنق في حادثه طيران في جنوب السودان في يوليو / تموز 2005 م، اعمال شغب عنيفه في الخرطوم لمده ثلاثه ايام، قبل ان تتمكن قوات الامن من السيطره على الوضع.\nفي 23 اكتوبر / تشرين الاول 2012 م تعرض مصنع اليرموك للذخيره بمنطقه الشجره بالخرطوم الى تفجيرات اعلنت الحكومه السودانيه بانها كانت نتيجه غاره جويه اسرائيليه.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالموقع\nتقع الخرطوم في منتصف المساحه الماهوله في السودان تقريباً شمال شرق وسط البلاد بين خط العرض16 درجه شمالاَ وخط العرض 15 درجه جنوباَ وخطي الطول 21 درجه غرباً و 24 درجه شرقاَ، وتتمدد مساحتها البالغه 20736 كيلو متر (12884 ميل) مربع بين الضفه الغربيه لنهر النيل الازرق من الناحيتين الشرقيه والشماليه والضفه الشرقيه للنيل الابيض من الغرب وسهل الجزيره تجاه الجنوب وهي المنطقه القابله لتمدد المدينه عمرانياً.\nوتتوسط الخرطوم ولايات كسلا والقضارف والنيل والجزيره والنيل الابيض وشمال كردفان. وهي ايضا قريبه من ولايات النيل الازرق والشماليه وسنار وجنوب كردفان وتفصلها عن ولايات دار فور الكبرى ارض صحراويه وشبه صحراويه جرداء فقط.\n\nالصوره الطوبوغرافيه\nتقع الخرطوم على ارتفاع 382 متر (1,253,28 قدم) فوق سطح البحر فوق ارض سهليه مستويه السطح مع انحدار طفيف نحو مجرى نهر النيل تتخللها تلال ونتوءات صخريه وكثبان رمليه متفرقه مما يعطي صوره لتضاريس منبسطه مع تموجات طفيفه، وتتخلل هذا المشهد الطبيعي ايضاً طبقات وارصفه اوديه نيليه وخيران ابرزها خور جانقي في منطقه العُشَرَه والصحافه من جهه الشرق، ويتميز الجانب الذي يقع غرب النيل الابيض بانه اكثر انحداراً من جهه النيل الازرق شرقاً، ولهذا فان الخيران التي تقع في الغرب تصب معظمها في النيل ابّان موسم الامطار في حين نجد الخيران الواقعه في الشرق غير منتظمه الفيضان ومعظمها ليس سوى جروف واسعه تفشل في الوصول الى النيل خاصه في الاماكن التي تغطيها مكونات رمليه. ويشكل النيلين الازرق والابيض اهم ظاهره طبيعيه للخرطوم حيث يلتقيان عند نقطه المقرن.\nجيولوجياً، تقع الخرطوم في حوض الخرطوم الذي يشكل جزء من حوض النيل الازرق ويتكون من الصخور المتحوله والصخور الناريه التي تنتمي الى حزام الموزمبيق وتظهر بوضوح في منطقه السبلوقه شمال الخرطوم. والخصائص الجيولوجيه المهمه في الخرطوم هي: الحجر الرملي النوبي، والحجر الرملي المغطى بالجبس والتكتلات الصخريه الرسوبيه. وتبين من دراسه بنيه القشره الارضيه لحوض الخرطوم باستخدام 3 محطات رصد دائمه للزلازل في نطاق 40 كيلومتر (24,8 ميل) من وسط الخرطوم، بان حوض الخرطوم هو واحد من عده احواض متصدعه في السودان مرتبطه مع نظام الاخدود الافريقي الوسيط وان سمك القشره الارضيه تحت حوض الخرطوم يتراوح ما بين 33 (20,5 ميل) و 37 (22,9 ميل) كيلومتر بمتوسط قدره 35 (21,7 ميل) كيلومتر.\n\nملتقى النيلين الازرق والابيض\nيتميز النيل الابيض الذي ياتي الى الخرطوم من جهه الجنوب باتساع مجراه وبطء جريانه وقله انحداره حيث يشبه البحيره الراكده خاصه موسم فيضان النيل الازرق. وبسبب قله سرعه تياره تقل عمليات النحت في ضفافه ويزداد الارساب، وعلى نقيض ذلك يتسم النيل الازرق الذي ينبع من الهضبه الاثيوبيه شرقاً بسرعه التيار وشده الانحدار وعمق المجري. ويلاحظ المرء بوضوح ارتفاع ضفافه في المنطقه القريبه من المقرن على شارع النيل في الخرطوم حيث تم بناء حائط على الضفاف اتقاء لفيضانه، في حين تنعدم هذه الانشاءات في ضفاف النيل الابيض كما يلاحظ سرعه جريانه وقوه تياره من خلال دفعه لمياه النيل الابيض الى الوراء قليلاً عند التقائهما في نقطه المقرن، فضلاً عن ملاحظه الفارق في لون مياه مجراهما حيث يسود مياه النيل الازرق لون الطمي البني الداكن، بينما تجري المياه شبه صافيه بين ضفاف النيل الابيض مما يعطيها بياضاً عند النظر اليها من علو، مقابل زرقه النيل الازرق.\n\nالجزر النيليه\nوتشكل ايضاً معالم سياحيه طبيعيه يزورها العديد من السياح ويقصدها سكان العاصمه المثلثه للاسترواح والتنزه واثناء العطلات والاجازات واهم هذه الجزر:\n\nجزيره توتي\n\nجزيره توتي تقع بين النيل الازرق من الشرق والجنوب، قباله اجمل مناطق الخرطوم (شارع النيل والمقرن) وينطلق منها النيل في رحلته نحو الشمال بعد التقاء رافديه الازرق والابيض من جهه الغرب. تحتضن الجزيره قريه صغيره مساحتها 8 كيلو متر مربع (3 اميال مربعه). يعود تاريخ تاسيسها الى القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي، وتتميز بشواطئها الرمليه وبساتينها التي تنتج الفاكهه والخضر ومن بينها الليمون والبرتقال والجرجير. وتم ربطها بالخرطوم بجسر معلق طوله 310 متر. تستقبل القريه الزوار من العاصمه المثلثه والسياح لقضاء اوقات استجمام وترويح فيها، خاصه في ايام العطلات. وهناك محاولات لبناء منتجع سياحي كبير فيها.\n\nجزيره التمساح\nتقع في وسط النيل الازرق بالقرب من قريه ام دوم جنوب الخرطوم وعرفت بهذا الاسم نسبه لشكلها الذي يشبه شكل التمساح.\n\nجزيره البط\nتوجد فيها اعداد كبيره من الطيور المائيه المستوطنه والمهاجره.\n\nالغابات\nغابه السنط\nتقع في غرب الخرطوم بالقرب من مجرى نهر النيل الابيض وتم اعلانها هي محميه طبيعيه في عام 1939 م وتتكون معظم اشجارها من السنط الذي يقاوم مياه فيضانات النهر خلال فصل الخريف، وتاوي الغابه انواع عديده من الطيور المستوطنه والمهاجره مثل الاوز وطير البقر وخطاف البحر وابو منجل والبط والنورس النهري ومالك الحزين.\n\nالحزام الاخضر\nوهو نطاق من الاشجار من الاشجار الفارعه الارتفاع كاشجار البان التي تم استزراعها في الاطراف الجنوبيه بغرض حمايه المدينه من الزحف الصحراوي والحد من هبوب الرياح القويه نحو المدينه من الجهه التي لا يجري فيها احد فرعي النيل، الا ان التوسع العمراني في العقود الاخيره قد تجاوز حدود هذا النطاق.\n\nالمناخ\nدرجات الحراره\nتعتبر الخرطوم واحده من المدن الرئيسيه الاكثر حراره في العالم. فقد تتجاوز درجات الحراره فيها 48 درجه مئويه (118.4 درجه فهرنهايت) في منتصف الصيف، الا ان المتوسط السنوي لدرجات الحراره القصوى يبلغ حوالي 37.1 درجه مئويه (98.78 فهرنهايت)، مع سته اشهر في السنه يزيد المتوسط الشهري لدرجه الحراره فيها عن 38 درجه مئويه (100.4 فهرنهايت)، ولا يوجد في جدول حاله الطقس الخاص بالخرطوم معدلاً لدرجه الحراره الشهريه يقل عن 30 درجه مئويه (86.5 فهرنهايت)، وهو ما تتم ملاحظته في جداول خاصه بمدن رئيسيه اخرى ذات مناخ صحراوي حار مماثل كالرياض، او بغداد او فينيكس بولايه اريزونا. وفي كل الاحوال فان درجات الحراره في الخرطوم تهبط بمعدلات كبيره خلال الليل، الى ادنى من 15 درجه مئويه (59 فهرنهايت) في شهر يناير / كانون الثاني وقد تصل الى 6 درجات مئويه (42.8 درجه فهرنهايت) عند مرور جبهه هوائيه بارده.\n\nالامطار\nيسود الخرطوم في معظم اشهر السنه المناخ الصحراوي الحار الجاف باستثناء شهري يوليو / تموز واغسطس / اب، حيث تسقط الامطار المداريه الشديده، بمعدل يزيد قليلاً على 155 مليمتر (6.1 بوصه) سنوياً في المتوسط، وفي الفتره من ديسمبر / كانون الاول وحتى فبراير / شباط حيث تنخفض درجه الحراره نسبياُ.\nوفي الشتاء وهي الفتره من ديسمبر / كانون الاول وحتى فبراير / شباط يكون الجو لطيفاً الى حد ما، حيث تنخفض درجات الحراره في الصباح وحتى الظهيره وبعد غروب الشمس. وتتراوح درجه الحراره خلال هذه الفتره ما بين 32 درجه مئويه (89.6 درجه فهرنهايت) 28 درجه مئويه (82.4 فهرنهايت).\n\nحركه الرياح\nثمه ظاهره مناخيه في السودان تعرف بالهبوب وهو عاصفه ترابيه نشطه تحدث في مناطق وسط السودان بما فيها الخرطوم وذلك عندما تهب رياح جنوبيه رطبه في شهري مايو / ايار ويوليو / تموز ويمكن ان تقلل بشكل مؤقت مدى الرؤيه الى الصفر.\nانسب وقت لزياره الخرطوم من حيث المناخ هي الفتره ما بين شهري نوفمبر / تشرين الثاني ومارس / اذار.\n\nالاداره\nالخرطوم هي محليه من محليات ولايه الخرطوم التي تضم ايضاً الخرطوم بحري وام درمان وشرق النيل ومحليات اُخرى.\nكانت تتكون محليه الخرطوم من ثلاث وحدات اداريه هي:\n\nوحده الخرطوم وتضم احياء ومناطق:\n\nُ\nالخرطوم شمال، البراري، امتداد ناصر، الخرطوم وسط، الديوم الشرقيه، الديوم الغربيه، الشجره الجنوبيه، الشجره الشماليه، العمارات، الخرطوم1، الخرطوم 2، الخرطوم3، الخرطوم غرب، المنطقه الصناعيه، الخرطوم السوق الشعبي، الكلاكلات.\n\nوحده الشهدا وتشمل احياء ومناطق:\nالصحافه وجبره، الامتداد، العشره، السوق المحلي، السوق المركزي، الدوحه، وسوبا الشاحنات.\n\nوحده الخرطوم شرق وتتبع لها:\nاركويت شرق، اركويت غرب، الطائف، المنشيه، الجريف غرب، المطار، جاردن سيتي، الرياض.\nحالياً، تحتوي خارطه المحليه الاداريه على ست وحدات اداريه تشمل:-\n\nوحده الخرطوم شمال الاداريه\nوحده الخرطوم شرق الاداريه\nوحده الخرطوم غرب الاداريه\nوحده الخرطوم وسط الاداريه\nوحده الشهداء وسوبا الاداريه\nوحده الشجره الاداريه\nوتتولى هذه الوحدات الاداريه مهمه تقديم الخدمات العامه للمواطنين على نحو اشبه بما تقوم به البلديات والجماعات الحضريه في عواصم اخرى، ويشرف على اداره المحليه رئيس يسمى المعتمد، الا ان والي الولايه يمثل اعلى سلطه اداريه في الخرطوم.\n\nالسياحه\nتعتبر الخرطوم احدى المراكز السياحيه المهمه في السودان، ليس فقط باعتبارها عاصمه البلاد وواحده من اكبر مدنها، بل لوجود عدد من المقومات السياحيه مثل المتاحف والاثار والحدائق والفضاءات الخضراء الى جانب الانديه الرياضيه والمهرجانات وغيرها من الفعاليات.\n\nالمتاحف\nهناك عده متاحف في الخرطوم اهمها هي:\n\nالمتحف القومي المُطل على نهر النيل الازرق وفي منطقه المقرن ويحتوي على مقتنيات اثريه من مختلف انحاء السودان، يمتد تاريخها الى عصور ما قبل التاريخ، وحتى فتره الممالك النوبيه وتشتمل الصالات الداخليه للمتحف على العديد من المقتنيات المعروضه في شكل منحوتات وانيه فخاريه وزجاجيه وخشبيه ومعدنيه، وادوات زينه وصور حائطيه في حين يشتمل فناء المتحف على عدد من المعابد والمدافن والنصب التذكاريه، والتماثيل القديمه باحجام مختلفه، التي نقلت من مناطق استكشافها في شمال السودان، واهمها معابد (سمنه شرق) و (سمنه غرب) وبوهين، ومقبره الامير (حجو تو حتب) واعمده كاتدرائيه فرس. كما يضم المتحف مقتنيات اثريه يرجع تاريخها الى العصر الحجري القديم وحتى نهايه فتره سلطنه سنار في عام 1821 م.\nمتحف التاريخ الطبيعي، يقع في شارع الجامعه ويحتوى على حيوانات محنطه واخرى حيّه بهدف التعريف بما هو متوافر في السودان من زواحف وطيور ومواشي وحشرات تعريفاً علمياً، وتلعب جامعه الخرطوم دوراً مهماً في استمراريه هذا المتحف والحفاظ عليه، ومن الطيور الموجوده فيه صقر الجديان الذي يمثل شعار السودان.\nمتحف القصر، وتعرض فيه لوحات زيتيه وصور فوتوغرافيه لحكام السودان منذ الحكم الثنائي في عام 1889 م، وحتى فتره ما بعد الاستقلال وبعض السيارات الرئاسيه التي كانوا يستخدمونها خلال فتره حكمهم وما تلقّاه الرؤساء الوطنيين من هدايا اضافه الى الالات الموسيقيه وقطع الاواني والاثاث التي استخدمت في القصر الرئاسي. ويقع المتحف في مبنى كنيسه اثريه بيزنطيه المعمار داخل جزء من الحديقه الجنوبيه الشرقيه للقصر.\nمتحف الاثنوغرافيا في ملتقى شارع الجامعه بشارع المك نمر وتعرض فيه نماذج من الادويه التقليديه المستعمله في الحياه اليوميه بالسودان ونماذج من اسلحه الصيد وادوات الزراعه والانتاج لدى القبائل المختلفه بالسودان الى جانب نماذج من ازيائهم والاتهم لموسيقيه، ومركز الفولكلور التابع للهيئه القوميه للاداب والفنون.\nالمتحف الحربي (العسكري)، بوزاره الدفاع وفيه مجموعه من نماذج الاسلحه الاثريه المختلفه والازياء العسكريه والدروع والصور والخرائط العسكريه التاريخيه.\n\nالمعالم الاثريه\nالقباب العثمانيه التي تقع شرق ساحه ابو جنزير في وسط الخرطوم ويرجع تاريخها الى بدايات العهد العثماني بالسودان في سنه 1839 م، وتضم مقابر لمشاهير القاده والعسكريين الاتراك في السودان ومن بينهم مؤسس الخرطوم الحكمدار عثمان جركس باشا البرنجي.\nموقع سوبا شرق النيل الاثري جنوب الخرطوم بحرى، الذي يضم اثار عاصمه مملكه علوه المسيحيه من القرن السادس الى القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي، ومن بينها بقايا كنيسه قديمه.\nالمباني الاثريه ومنها القصر الجمهوري ومبنى البريد المركزي ومعمل استاك وغيرها تضاف الى ذلك المعالم السياحيه في كل من ام درمان والخرطوم بحري على الضفاف الاخرى لنهري النيل (الازرق والابيض) والتي يمكن الوصول اليها من الخرطوم بسهوله.\n\nالحدائق النباتيه والحيوانيه\nتوجد في الخرطوم حديقه نباتيه تبلغ مسلحتها 11 فدان وتحتوى على انواع عديده ونادره من النباتات، كما توجد حديقه للحيوانات في غابه السنط ويجري العمل على انشاء حديقه سفاري.\n\nالسياحه النهريه\nتشتهر الخرطوم ايضاً بالسياحه النهريه على نهر النيل حيث توجد البواخر النيليه وقوارب الفلوكه والزوارق والقوارب الشراعيه والعبّارات والتي تمخر مياه النيلين الازرق والابيض وتعبر بركابها الى جزيره توتي وسط النيل حيث البساتين التقليديه النضره. وتوجد المراكب بالقرب من المقرن وجزيره توتي وجزيره التمساح، وتقوم برحلات نهاريه وليليه.\n\nرحلات السفاري\nيتميز السودان بتباين نطاقه المناخي والبيئي وهو ما يتّضح جلياً في وجود انواع كثيره من الحيوانات والطيور وتقوم شركات ومكاتب السفاري والرحلات البريه في الخرطوم بتنظيم رحلات مرخصه للصيد ذهاباً واياباً منها رحلات سفاري الغزلان، وسفاري صيد البط، والحمام البري الذي يمتد موسم صيده من نوفمبر / تشرين الثاني وحتى فبراير / شباط من العام.\n\nالمناطق الطبيعيه\nشلال السبلوقه\nيقع شلال السبلوقه على بعد 80 كيلو متر من الخرطوم ويتبع ادارياً لولايه نهر النيل وهو عباره عن كتل صخريه في وسط مجرى نهر النيل تعترض تدفق المياه، ويعرف ايضاً باسم الشلال السادس او الجندل السادس باعتباره سادس واخر العقبات الصخريه وسط مجرى نهر النيل ويشكل مقصداً للسياح خاصه السياح العرب والاجانب وذلك لطبيعه المنطقه التي تجمع بين التلال والمياه والجزر والكثبان الصحراويه والحياه البريه وتقام فيها رحلات نيليه.\n\nمقرن النيلين\nالمقرن في الخرطوم هو نقطه تلاقي رافدي نهر النيل وهما النيل الازرق القادم من الهضبه الاثيوبيه والنيل الابيض القادم من وسط افريقيا في مشهد طبيعي يشد الانتباه، حيث يلاحظ المرء كيف تسير مياه النيل الازرق الطينيه الداكنه ومياه النيل الابيض الصافيه جنباً الى جنب، ثم يختلطان مع بعضهما ويصبحان نهراً واحداً في مجرى واسع ذو مياه خفيفه الزرقه. وتوجد في المنطقه عده منتزهات ومتاحف وفنادق وجسر يربط المنطقه بام درمان.\n\nمنطقه جبل اولياء في الجنوب الغربي من الخرطوم، حيث السد القديم والبحيره التي خلفه ويشكلان بيئه نهريه زاخره بالاسماك والطيور والنباتات.\n\nالخدمات العامه\nالتعليم\nتعتبر الخرطوم قطباً مهماً للتعليم العالي في السودان، حيث تتركز فيها الجامعات والمعاهد العليا.وقد شهدت انشاء اول مدرسه نظاميه للسودان واول كليه جامعيه هي كليه غوردون التذكاريه التي تحول فيما بعد الى جامعه. كما يوجد بها العديد من المدارس بما في ذلك مدارس الجاليات الاجنبيه المقيمه فيها. وتستضيف الخرطوم المعهد الدولي لتعليم اللغه العربيه لغير الناطقين بها، الذي تم تاسيسه بالتعاون مع المنظمه العربيه للتربيه والثقافه والعلوم.\nعرفت الخرطوم التعليم منذ انشائها على يد فقهاء مدارس خلاويها فقد تزامن تاريخ تاسيسها مع قيام المدارس القرانيه فيها والتي انحصر دورها على التعاليم المرتبطه بالعقيده من تحفيظ سور القران وتفسيرها ومبادئ الفقه وقواعد اللغه العربيه واساسيات الحساب. وفي العهد العثماني تم افتتاح عده مدارس نظاميه حديثه في السودان من بينها مدرسه الخرطوم الابتدائيه التي افتتحت سنه 1855 م، لتعليم ابناء الموظفين الاتراك تحت اشراف العالم رفاعه رافع الطهطاوي الذي نفي الى السودان انذاك، ومنذ ذلك الحين انتشرت المدارس في المدينه على اختلاف مراحلها ومناهج التدريس فيها. ويمكن تقسيم المدارس في الخرطوم الى مدارس عامه حكوميه اصبح لبعضها شهره على نطاق السودان واخرى خاصه يديرها القطاع الخاص وتشمل هذه الفئه مدارس الجاليات الاجنبيه والتي ساهم بعضها بقدر كبير في مجال التعليم بالمدينه مثل مدارس البعثه المصريه واكبرها مدرسه جمال عبد الناصر الثانويه ومدارس الكليه القبطيه ومدارس كمبوني ومدرسه الراهبات والمدارس العالميه. وازداد عدد هذه المدارس في نهايه القرن الماضي ليشمل مدارس تدرس بلغات غير اللغتين العربيه والانجليزيه السائدتين في المجال التعليمي في الخرطوم ومن بينها المدرسه الارمنيه والمدرسه التركيه. ومن مدارس الجاليات الاجنبيه: المدرسه البريطانيه ومدرسه الاتحاد والمدرسه الامريكيه ومدرسه كامبريدج العالميه ومدرسه البارون والمدارس العالميه\nبلغ عدد المؤسسات التعليميه في ولايه الخرطوم في عام 2011م، حوالي 3000 منها 1600 مدرسه في مرحله الاساس و450 في المرحله الثانويه بالاضافه الى المدارس الخاصه ومؤسسات التعليم قبل المدرسي ومراكز تعليم الكبار.\nجدول بالجامعات والمعاهد العليا الكبيره الموجوده في الخرطوم:\n\nانظر ايضا\n\nقائمه الجامعات في السودان\n\nالرعايه الصحيه\nتوجد في الخرطوم عده مؤسسات صحيه وطبيه بما في ذلك المستشفيات والمستوصفات الطبيه وعيادات الاطباء الخاصه والاخصائيين الى جانب مكاتب مؤسسات التامينات الصحيه. ومن تلك المستشفيات، مستشفى الخرطوم التعليمي ومستشفى الشعب ومستشفى العيون ومستشفى الذره ومستشفى الاسنان وكلها تقع بوسط الخرطوم، الى جانب مجموعه كبيره من المستشفيات الخاصه منها مستشفى ابن سينا ومستشفى ابن خلدون والمستشفى السعودي والمستشفى التركي وغيرها. وتنتشر الصيدليات في المدينه ومجمعاتها العلاجيه.\nوتتقاسم اداره النظام الصحي في الخرطوم جهتان، هما الحكومه المركزيه ووزاره الصحه الاقليميه. وتشرف الحكومه المركزيه على حوالي 18 مستشفى في ولايه الخرطوم معظمها مستشفيات كبيره وعامه منها مستشفى الخرطوم التعليمي ومستشفى ابن سينا، بينما تشرف وزاره الصحه الاقليميه على المراكز الصحيه وحوالي 30 مستشفى صغير في مدن العاصمه المثلثه وضواحيها. ونظراً للتنافس الكبير بين هذه المستشفيات والمؤسسات الصحيه وعدم تكاملها فان الكثير من الموارد يتم اهدارها حيث تحصل المستشفيات الكبيره على دعم حكومي مما يجعلها تستقطب العدد الكبير من المرضى الامر الذي يشكل حاله من التكدس اضافه الى مشاكل التنقل على نحو يستدعي الاصلاح خاصه بعد التدهور الكبير في القطاع الصحي. واول تحد يواجه الاصلاح هو التوسع في الخدمات ونقلها الى خارج مركز العاصمه. والى جانب ذلك تشرف وزاره الصحه الاقليميه على نظام التامين الصحي بقسط قدره 25 جنيه سوداني (4 دولارات) شهرياً لجميع افراد العائله الواحده بينما يدفع العمال حوالي 60% من صندوق التامين الصحي وتغطي الحكومه النسبه المتبقيه. وتتولى صناديق الزكاه والاعمال الخيريه دفع اقساط مقدره من تامينات الاسر.\nاكبر مستشفى في الخرطوم هو مستشفى الخرطوم التعليمي الواقع على شارع الطابيه بوسط الخرطوم وتبلغ عدد الاسره فيه 750 سرير (عام 2013) واصغرها هو المستشفى السويدي في حي الجريف غرب الواقع شرق المدينه بالقرب من مطار الخرطوم الدولي وعدد الاسره فيه 30 سريراً. وهناك مستشفى الذره بشارع القصر وبه حوالي 141 سرير ومستشفى ابن سينا بشارع اللواء محمد نجيب ويسع لحوالي 147 سرير.\nاما عدد المستوصفات والمراكز الصحيه الاخرى فيبلغ حوالي 91 مستوصف و7 وحدات صحيه خاصه و11 مركز صحي. ويوجد في الخرطوم القومسيون الطبي وهو هيئه طبيه اداريه تقوم بمهمه استخراج شهادات التطعيم الدوليه وتحديد القياه الصحيه للافراد لاغراض التعيين في وظائف معينه ومواقع بيع الاطعمه وغيرها من المهام ذات الصله.\n\nالفندقه والمطاعم\nالفنادق\n\nتنتشر في مختلف ارجاء الخرطوم العديد من الفنادق على مختلف الدرجات ويتركز بعضها على ضفاف النيل بشارع النيل.\nومن تلك الفنادق فندق كورينثيا- برج الفاتح سابقاً وفندق كورال (الهيلتون سابقا) وفندق قصر الصداقه وفندق السلام روتانا وفندق جراند هوليداي وفندق مريديان (ريجينسى حاليا)وفندق شهرزاد وفنادق الاكروبول وصحارى وقباء وبلازا والبحرين وسنترال وكانون والحجاز ومشيريب والتاكا هاوس والفيصل سفاري بالاس والسواحلي والاراك وبحر الغزال وبيت الضيافه الالماني وفندق افريقيا وفندق الرياض الجديد وغيرها.\n\nالمطاعم\n\nتوجد في الخرطوم عده مطاعم تقدم مختلف الاطباق السودانيه والاجنبيه فهناك مطاعم تقدم اطباق لبنانيه كما في مطعم البستان على شارع افريقيا واطباق باكستانيه كما في مطعم سولت-ان-بيبر (ملح وفلفل) ومطعم الحبشه للطعام الاثيوبي في منطقه اركويت، والاطباق اليمنيه في مطعم حضرموت في سوق الخرطوم 2، والصينيه في مول (مجمع) عفراء والكوريه في شارع افريقيا والشاورما والكباب في شارع المطار، واللحوم في كانيفوري ويمكن تذوق الاطعمه السودانيه التقليديه في المطعم الشعبي 15. معظم المطاعم تتركز في مناطق العمارات والخرطوم 2 والرياض. وبعض المطاعم مزود بشاشات عرض وموسيقى حيه وانترنت. ويزخر شارع افريقيا وشارع النيل بالعديد من المطاعم والمقاهي.\n\nالاسواق والسوبرماركات\nتوجد بوسط الخرطوم سوقان رئيسيتان هما السوق العربي والسوق الافرنجي. وكلاهما قريبان من بعضهما من حيث المسافه ولكنهما تختلفان من حيث السلع المعروضه. فالاولى سوق تقليديه تعرض فيها السلع والمنتوجات المحليه المختلفه من الحبوب والتوابل، الى ادوات الزينه والذهب ومواد البناء والتشييد.والثانيه تضم محلات تجاريه تبيع السلع المستورده من اقمشه وقطع اثاث وتحف وما شابه ذلك. وهناك ايضاً اسواقاً مركزيه للخضر واللحوم، الى جانب السوق الشعبي.\nتوجد في الخرطوم عده سوبر ماركات محليه منتشره في الاحياء الراقيه، منها مول عفراء التجاري الذي تم تاسيسه في عام 4 م، بمنطقه اركويت وتتنوع الخدمات فيه من محلات تجاريه ومطاعم واماكن ترفيه الى موقف للسيارات. وهناك مول مركز العمارات والواحه مول الذي يتكون من اربعه ابراج وبه منطقه خضراء ومحلات تجاريه ومكاتب للشركات والافراد، ومركز واحه الخرطوم وهو واحد من المراكز التجاريه الحديثه في الخرطوم.\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nساعد موقع الخرطوم في وسط البلاد تقريباً على تسهيل ربطها بكافه عواصم ومدن ولايات السودان المختلفه، براً عبر الطرق الممهده والطرق الموسميه وجواً عبر الطيران الداخلي وبالبواخر النيليه عبر نهر النيل وبقطارات السكك الحديديه. اما داخل المدينه فتتنوع وسائل النقل من سياره الاجره الصفراء اللون وحافلات المدينه وغيرها من الحافلات الاخرى على مختلف الاحجام وتسمى بالباصات، كما تستخدم الدراجات الناريه ثلاثيه العجلات المعروفه بالتوك توك وتعرف في الخرطوم باسم الرقشه، فضلاً عن القطارات والعبارات النيليه.\n\nالنقل الجوي\nيوجد في الخرطوم مطار واحد وهو مطار الخرطوم الدولي لخدمه الركاب داخل السودان وخارجه، ويعتبر اكبر مطار في السودان. ويقع وسط مدينه الخرطوم، رمزه في منظمه النقل الجوي الدولي (اياتا) هو KRT وفي المنظمه الدوليه للطيران المدني (ايكاو) هو HSSS، ويبلغ طول مدرجه 2980 متر اي 9777 قدم ، وهو مرتبط بخطوط الى معظم المطارات الدوليه بالبلدان العربيه ومن بينها خط جده والقاهره ودمشق وطرابلس ودبي، وعدد من المطارات بالدول الاوربيه مثل مطارات اثينا ولندن وامستردام واسطنبول والاسيويه مثل بكين والافريقيه كاسمره واديس ابابا ونيروبي وغيرها. ويرتبط المطار بخطوط داخليه تتجه نحو المطارات المنتشره في ولايات السودان المختلفه مثل مطارات بورتسودان ونيالا والقضارف ودنقلا وكوستي.\nيجري العمل حالياً على انشاء مطار دولي جديد، بعيداً عن مركز العاصمه وذلك لعده اسباب اهمها وقوع المطار القديم في وسط المدينه مما يشكل خطوره على السكان وعائق امام بناء المباني الشاهقه والمرتفعه في الخرطوم، فضلاً عن زياده الطلب على الرحلات الدوليه للخرطوم، مما يستدعي بناء مطار جديد يستوفي المعايير الدوليه من حيث مدرجات الاقلاع والهبوط وصالات المسافرين وغيرها من المرافق الاخرى.\n\nالنقل النهري\nيوجد في الخرطوم ميناء نهري للنقل والسفر الى المدن الواقعه على ضفاف النيل الابيض جنوب الخرطوم حتى مدينه كوستي، كما يقدم خدمات سياحيه تتمثل في الرحلات النيليه وخدمات القوارب الشراعيه والزوارق في النيل. ويقع المقر الرئيسي للميناء في الخرطوم بحري. وهناك عبّاره (ويطلق عليها في السودان مَعدّيه) نهريه تقوم برحلات منتظمه لنقل الركاب والبضائع بين الخرطوم وجزيره توتي الواقعه في مجري نهر النيل.\n\nالطرق السريعه والجسور والانفاق\n\nترتبط الخرطوم بمدن السودان المختلفه بشبكه من الطرق السريعه ومنها شارع الخرطوم - ود مدني والخرطوم - القضارف والخرطوم- بورتسودان والخرطوم -دنقلا وغيرها.\nاما في الداخل فهناك بعض الشوارع الرئيسيه المشهوره من حيث طولها او المنطقه التي تشقها ومنها شارع افريقيا وشارع النيل ام درمان، وشارع القصر وهو احد اطول شوارع الخرطوم وشارع عبيد ختم وشارع الجمهوريه وشارع علي عبد اللطيف وشارع المك نمر. ويتم حالياً تنفيذ مشاريع لتوسعه شبكه الطرق الداخليه وتطويرها لتسهيل انسياب الحركه في المدينه مثل شارع النيل الخرطوم السريع والطريق الدائري.\n\nالخرطوم هي احدى مدن العاصمه المثلثه ولذلك فهي ترتبط بام درمان والخرطوم بحري بعده جسور مقامه على النيلين:الازرق والابيض وهي:\n\nكوبري النيل الابيض القديم حيث يربط الخرطوم مع ام درمان.\nكوبري الانقاذ حيث يربط الخرطوم مع ام درمان.\nكوبري النيل الازرق القديم حيث يربط الخرطوم مع الخرطوم بحري.\nكوبري بُري (القوات المسلحه)حيث يربط الخرطوم مع الخرطوم بحري.\nكوبري توتي حيث يربط الخرطوم مع جزيره توتي التي توجد في النيل الازرق.\nكوبري المك نمر حيث يربط الخرطوم مع خرطوم بحري.\nكوبري المنشيه حيث يربط الخرطوم مع شرق النيل.\nكوبري الدباسين حيث يربط بين الخرطوم وامدرمان ويوجد علي النيل الابيض (تحت الانشاء).\nالسكك الحديديه\n\nتعتبر الخرطوم احدى مراكز خطوط السكك الحديديه في السودان، حيث تتجه نحوها كافه الخطوط الممتده من الولايات المختلفه شرقاً (من جهه كسلا - القضارف - ود مدني) وغرباً (من نيالا - الابيض عبر تقاطع سنار في الوسط) وشمالاً (من وادي حلفا مروراً بابو حمد وعطبره) ومن كريمه في الشمال الغربي الى الخرطوم، فضلاً عن ذلك تعمل قطارات السكك الحديديه على نقل الركاب داخل مدينه الخرطوم من مناطق الكلاكله في اقصى جنوب المدينه الى وسط الخرطوم. وتوجد محطه للقطارات في الخرطوم بحري. وكانت المدينه تعرف نظام الترامواي في ثلاثينيات القرن الماضي قبل ان تتم ازاله خطوطها بعد فتره الاستقلال في وجه التمدد العمراني وكثافه حركه المرور بوسط المدينه.\n\nالعماره والتخطيط العمراني\nتوالت عمليات تخطيط الخرطوم منذ تشكيل اول لجنه للتخطيط العمراني في عام 1927 م، وكان ابرزها تخطيط عام 1946 و1950 والذي شمل توسيع الطرق والشوارع وانشاء الحدائق العامه والميادين ويناء امتدادات جديده في الاحياء لاستيعاب موجات الهجره السكانيه نحو العاصمه. ونتيجه للنمو الديمغرافي والرغبه في تجميل العاصمه شهدت الخرطوم عمليه تخطيط في عام 1958، خاصه في المنطقه القريبه من مقرن النيلين وبرز نمط معماري جديد مغاير للنمط الاستعماري، كما تكررت العمليه التخطيطيه في عام 1977 و1990 م في المنطقه نفسها.\nلا يوجد نمط معماري معين او لون طلاء محدد تتميز به الخرطوم اذ توجد مختلف الاشكال والانماط والالوان في المدينه، الا ان من الممكن التمييز بين خطوط معماريه واضحه في طراز الابنيه من حيث تاريخ بنائها، ففي المنطقه الشماليه المطله على النيل الازرق يظهر النمط الكولونيالي الذي يعود الى القرن التاسع عشر والعصر الفيكتوري وما قبله وفن العماره المملوكيه الاسلاميه ويتمثل في مباني الوزارات والدواوين الحكوميه القديمه التي بناها الاتراك ومن بينها سراي الحكمدار (القصر الجمهوري القديم) في المنطقه المحاذيه للنيل الازرق، ويلاحظ ان هذه المنطقه قد تم تخطيط شوارعها في عهد كتشنر على شكل العلم البريطاني (الصلبان المتقاطعه راسياً وافقياً وعرضياً) مستنداً في تخطيطه بشكل عام على مخطط وشنطن الامريكي مع ادخال بعض العناصر العسكريه كبناء ثكنات الجنود (داخليات جامعه الخرطوم حالياً). (في عام 1908 م، تم تنفيذ مخطط ملكين وهو بمثابه تعديل لتخطيط كتشنر متاثر بتخطيط جاردن سيتي في القاهره).\nويسود المنطقه التي تليها جنوباً معمار خمسينيات وستينيات القرن الماضي ومن ابرز امثلته امتداد فندق السودان، وكلما ابتعدنا جنوباً من النيل او اتجهنا نحو اطرافه الشماليه في منطقه المقرن نجد نماذج لانماط العماره المعاصره مثل قصر المؤتمرات (المسمى بقاعه الصداقه) والذي بناه الصينيون في سبعينيات القرن الماضي وهو شبيه بمباني ميدان السلام الابدي في بكين، والعماره الحديثه ممثله فندق كورينثيا، برج الفاتح سابقاً المبني على شكل بيضه نعام ضخمه ومبنى بنك السودان المركزي الجديد ذو الواجهه الزجاجيه.\nتشمل العماره الحديثه مباني الابراج العاليه مثل برج الاتصالات سوداتيل الذي يتكون من 29 طابقاً وبرج شركه بترودار واداره الخطوط الجويه السودانيه وابراج القوات المسلحه المصمم احدها في شكل بارجه والاخر على شكل طائره وهي من المباني التي تاحذ اشكالاً هندسيه وفقاً لدور المؤسسه التي انشاتها كمقر لها. وتتركز مباني الابراج في وسط الخرطوم ومنطقتي المقرن وبري.\n\nالميادين والحدائق العامه\n\nاهتم مؤسسو مدينه الخرطوم بالخضره في المدينه، فقاموا بتشجير شوارعها باشجار ظليله كاشجار اللبخ والنيم التي اقيمت على طول الضفه الشرقيه للنيل الازرق والتي تم جلبها من بلدان كالهند، كما شجعوا الاهالي على زراعه الاشجار واقامه الحدائق في منازلهم وكانت تجرى وحتى سنوات قريبه مسابقات حول اجمل الحدائق المنزليه في منطقه الخرطوم عموم. وفي ستينيات القرن الماضي اقيمت حدائق في الاحياء البعيده عن مركز المدينه مثل حديقه القرشي وفي سبعينيات القرن ذاته تم تخصيص مساحات واسعه مكسوه بالحشائش والشجيرات في المنطقه القريبه من المقرن. وفي السنوات الاخيره تم نشر اشجار النخيل في عدد من شوارع المدينه وساحاتها الخضراء. وزاد الاهتمام بالحدائق العامه والبيئه الخضراء وذلك في ضوء تزايد نسبه انبعاث الكربون من السيارات والمصانع ومن هذه الحدائق الساحه الخضراء وهي عباره عن فضاء متعدد الاغراض حيث توجد فيه ملاعب ومرافق رياضيه متاحه للجمهور مضامير لرياضه المشي والعدو ومسرح ثقافي على الهواء الطلق وملاعب اطفال واماكن ترويح وتحيط بها بضعه محلات تجاريه صغيره لبيع التحف وغيرها ومطاعم ومكتبه عامه.\nومن ابرز الحدائق العامه والمنتزهات الاخرى:\n\nوالى جانب المنتزهات والحدائق العامه توجد بضعه بساتين توفر بعضها اماكن للرحلات الخلويه بعد الاتفاق مع اصحابها، ومنها بساتين الجريف غرب وبساتين جزيره توتي.\nكما توجد في الخرطوم عده ميادين وساحات عامه ومنها ميدان جمال عبد الناصر (المحطه الوسطى سابقاً) ميدان محطه السوق العربي وميدان ابو جنزير، وميدان الامم المتحده في وسط المدينه، وميدان المولد في الخرطوم جنوب.\nومع ذلك فان الخرطوم في حاجه الى مزيد من الساحات والميادين والمنتزهات والحدائق العامه الواسعه المساحه واعاده تاهيل الاماكن الخضراء الحاليه والعنايه بها.\n\nالمساجد دور العباده\n\nيدين اغلب سكان الخرطوم بالاسلام، ولذلك توجد بالمدينه اعداداً كبيره من المساجد. وقد تسارعت وتيره انشاء المساجد في الخرطوم بالاحياء وبالمؤسسات وشرعت الطرق الصوفيه والجماعات الدينيه بانشاء مساجد خاصه بها. وانتشرت في الاونه الاخيره ظاهره المساجد التي تقام في المؤسسات ومن بينها مسجد القوات المسلحه في مقر قياده القوات المسلحه السودانيه جوار قاعه الشهيد الزبير ومسجد القصر في ساحه القصر الجمهوري وغيرها من المساجد المنشره باحجام مختلفه في مقرات المؤسسات الحكوميه وشركات القطاع الخاص والمؤسسات التعليميه والصحيه. ومن المساجد الكبيره والبارزه في وسط الخرطوم مسجد جامعه الخرطوم ومسجد الشهيد والجامع العتيق (مسجد الخرطوم الكبير) او مسجد عباس سابقاً، الذي افتتحه الخديوي عباس حلمي باشا في 4 ديسمبر / كانون الاول 1901 م، عند زيارته للسودان. وتتنوع انماط الهندسه المعماريه لهذه المساجد من الطراز المملوكي القديم كما في جامع فاروق الى الطراز العُثماني كما في مسجد النور والهندسه المعماريه الحديثه في مسجد جامعه الخرطوم. وتوجد بمعظم المساجد مدارس قرانيه تدرس علوم الفقه والتوحيد وغيرها من الدروس الدينيه وخلاويها لتعليم النشء كيف الصلاه وغيرها من العبادات وتحفيظ القران.\n\nوللمسيحيه تاريخاَ طويلاَ في الخرطوم يعود الى دوله علوه التي اعتنقت الديانه المسيحيه في سنه 580 ميلاديه وكانت عاصمتها سوبا (احدى ضواحي الخرطوم حاليا) قبل ان تتعرض للتخريب على يد الفونج في سنه 1504 م،\nثم في العهد العثماني عندما اصبح اراكيل باشا الارمني المسيحي حاكماً عاماً للسودان في سنه 1857 وخلال فتره الحكم الثنائي الذي كان على راسه حكام بريطانيون.\n(انظر: ملحق حكام السودان).\nوفي 3 ابريل / نيسان 1846 قرر بابا الفاتيكان غريغوري السادس عشر انشاء مطرانيه رسوليه لوسط افريقيا مع ابرشيه في الخرطوم وتتبع لها اليوم اربع كنائس في الخرطوم بما فيها كاتدرائيه القديس متى والقديس بطرس في منطقه الامتداد الجديد بالخرطوم.\nوتتبع لهذه الكنائس مدارس ومنظمات من بينها مدرسه فيلا جيلدا للبنات التابعه للكنيسه الارثوذكسيه بشارع 21 اكتوبر، المتقاطع مع شارع الطيار جميل، ومدارس كمبوني على شارع القصر التي اسسها الاسقف دانيال كمبوني.\nوكان في الخرطوم كنيس يهودي يقع في شارع القصر (شارع فكتوريا سابقا) مبنى على طراز معابد السفارديم ويعمل على خدمه اليهود قبل مغادرتهم السودان في اواخر ستينيات القرن الماضي، الى جانب مقبره يهوديه قديمه بالخرطوم عند مدخل المنطقه الصناعيه، جنوب كوبري الحريه.\n\nاسماء الشوارع والميادين العامه في الخرطوم\nتفتقر الخرطوم الى خطه واضحه فيما يتعلق باسماء الاحياء السكنيه والشوارع والميادين العامه، فضلا عن ان معظمها لا توجد عليه لوحات تدل علي اسمه ولا على ارقام العقارات والمنازل المطله عليه حسبما هو وارد في خططها التخطيطيه العديده، وتتنوع مصادر الاسماء الموجوده والمتعارف عليها فبعض الاحياء السكنيه مثلاً يحمل اسماء احياء او مدن عربيه ظهرت بعض موجات الهجره الى تلك البلدان خاصه دول الخليج ومن هذه الاحياء: الرياض والطائف (مدن سعوديه) والدوحه (مدينه قطريه) والمنشيه والجاردن سيتي (احياء مدن مصريه) والاندلس (مغربيه) ووالقادسيه (عراقيه).\nومن اسماء الشوارع: شارع غوردون (نسبه للجنرال غوردون باشا) حاكم السودان في اواخر فتره حكم التركيه السابقه في السودان وتبدل اسمه بعد استقلال السودان في عام 1956 وفي اطار سياسه السودنه الي شارع الجامعه (نسبه الى جامعه الخرطوم المطله عليه)، وشارع فكتوريا (نسبه للملكه فكتوريا ملكه بريطانيا) واصبح شارع القصر، وهناك شارع ونجت باشا سمي باسم (ريجنالد ونجت حاكم عام السودان في الفتره 1899 - 1916، واصبح اسمه لاحقاً شارع البرلمان اما شارع السردار (وهو قائد القوات البريطانيه ابان فتره الاستعمار الحكم الثنائي) اصبح شارع الجمهوريه وشارع الدفتردار (نسب الى الدفتردار محمد، صهر محمد على باشا في سنه 1821 م) اصبح شارع المك نمر (نسبه للمك نمر حاكم شندي الذي قتل قائد الجيش العثماني المصري في سنه 1821 م) وشارع اسماعيل باشا (نسبه الى اسماعيل باشا نجل محمد علي باشا وقائد الحمله على السودان قي سنه 1821م) واصبح شــارع علي عبد اللطيف (احد رموز المقاومه الوطنيه ضد الاستعمار البريطاني في السودان) وشارع محمد نجيب (اول رئيس وزراء مصر ي بعد ثوره تموز / يوليو 1952 م) ولم يتغير اسم الشارع تخليداً لذكرى محمد نجيب ذو الاصول والسودانيه (امه مصريه وابوه سوداني) كذلك لم يتغير اسم شارع كاترينا نسبه الى مدام كاترينا اليونانيه الاصل وصاحبه متجر في ستينيات القرن الماضي كان يقع شرق حديقه القرشي بالخرطوم والتي بدورها كانت تعرف باسم حديقه عبود في عام 1960 نسبه الى الرئيس ابراهيم عبود وتحولت الى حديقه القرشي نسبه الى شهيد ثوره اكتوبر احمد القرشي والتي اطاحت بحكومه الرئيس عبود. ومن شوارع الخرطوم الاخرى التي تحمل اسماء سودانيه شارع السيد عبد الرحمن (نسبه الى عبد الرحمن المهدي زعيم طائفه الانصار ورمز منم رموز الاستقلال) وشارع السيد علي الميرغني (زعيم طائفه الختميه واحد رموز الاستقلال)، وشارع عبيد ختم الذي سمي على الشهيد عبيد ختم، وهي تسميه جديده وشارع البلابل (نسبه الى فرقه البلابل| الغنائيه المشهوره في السودان). واطلق على الشارع الرئيس المؤدي الى مطار الخرطوم الدولي اسم شارع افريقيا.\nاما الميادين العامه فمن اشهرها ميدان عباس (سمي على اسم الخديو عباس) وتحول اسمه لاحقاً الى ميدان الامم المتحده ثم اقيمت في مساحته مكتبه القبه الخضراء واخيراً مول الواحه، وهناك ميدان عبد المنعم محمد (احد رجال الاعمال البارزين) تمت اعاده تسميته الى ميدان نادي الاسره.\nولعل من ابرز ساحات وميادين الخرطوم العامه ميدان ابو جنزير وسمي على اسم الشيخ ابو جنزير (وهو احد شيوخ الصوفيه في الخرطوم كان يدير خلوه لتدريس القران في هذا المكان حتى توفي ودفن فيه واقيم عليه ضريحاً له كان موجودا حتى وقت فريب تحيط به سلسله من الحلقات الحديديه الصنع)، كذلك يوجد في الخرطوم ميدان جاكسون بمنطقه الخرطوم غرب والذي لم يكن معروفاً بشكل واسع قبل ان يتم مؤخراً تحويل موقف حافلات الركاب العامه اليه من مواقفها بمنطقه وسط الخرطوم (وسمي الميدان والحي الذي يقع عليه بهذا الاسم نسبه الى جاكسون باشا مهندس المساحه الانجليزي ببلديه الخرطوم في عام 1920 م.\n\nمعالم الخرطوم\nالاقتصاد\nكتب ونستون تشرشل رئيس وزراء بريطانيا الاسبق، في كتابه حرب النهر، عن الخرطوم وقال «ان مدينه الخرطوم الواقعه عند التقاء النيلين الازرق والابيض، هي النقطه التي يجب ان تلتقي فيها التجاره حتماً مع الجنوب. وهي الصنبور الكبير الذي تمر من خلاله البضائع التي تم جمعها من منطقه واسعه وتنساب شمالا نحو ساحل البحر المتوسط. فهي معلم لاقصى حدود شمال السودان الخصب. وينساب النهر بين الخرطوم واسوان لمسافه 1 كيلومتر عبر الصحراء القاحله».\n\nلايزال اقتصاد الخرطوم يعتمد على التجاره واعاده توزيع البضائع والسلع وعلى قطاع الخدمات، خاصه الخدمات الماليه كالبنوك ومكاتب الصرافه والتامينات وغيرها.\nوكانت التجاره في فتره الحكم الثنائي حكراً على ثلاث شركات بريطانيه تهيمن على الصادر والوارد في السودان وهي: شركه متشل كوتس، وشركه سودان مركنتايل، وشركه جلاتلي هانكي وشركائهم، حيث يقوم التجار المحليون ببيع المحاصيل الزراعيه السودانيه من قطن وصمغ عربي وسمسم وفول سوداني لتلك الشركات التي تقوم بدورها تصدير السلع السودانيه للخارج واستيراد سلع وبضائع اجنبيه وبيعها لتجار الجمله المحليين.\nيتنوع النشاط الاقتصادي الحالي في المدينه من زراعي الى صناعي وسياحي، ويتركز بصفه اساسيه على قطاع الخدمات حيث نجد مجموعه كبيره من السكان تعمل في دواوين الدوله وشركات وبنوك القطاع الخاص، كما ان هناك شريحه كبيره من اصحاب رؤوس الاموال تمارس التجاره، اما سكان المناطق الريفيه المحيطه بالمدينه وبعض القاطنين علي ضفاف النيل فيعملون بالزراعه والرعي ويمدون العاصمه بالخضر والفاكهه والالبان واللحوم والاسماك، ومنهم من يمارس صناعه الفخار والطوب.\n\nالمصارف والنشاط المالي\nتقع معظم المقار الرئيسيه للبنوك التجاريه في الخرطوم
