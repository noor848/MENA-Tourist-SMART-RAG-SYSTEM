          "content": "Meroë (; also spelled Meroe; Meroitic: 𐦨𐦡𐦷𐦡𐦥𐦢, romanized: Medewi; Arabic: مرواه, romanized: Meruwah and مروي, Meruwi; Ancient Greek: Μερόη, romanized: Meróē) was an ancient city on the east bank of the Nile about 6 km north-east of the Kabushiya station near Shendi, Sudan, approximately 200 km north-east of Khartoum. Near the site is a group of villages called Bagrawiyah (Arabic: البجراوية). This city was the capital of the Kingdom of Kush for several centuries from around 590 BC, until its collapse in the 4th century AD. The Kushitic Kingdom of Meroë gave its name to the \"Island of Meroë\", which was the modern region of Butana, a region bounded by the Nile (from the Atbarah River to Khartoum), the Atbarah and the Blue Nile.\nThe city of Meroë was on the edge of Butana. There were two other Meroitic cities in Butana: Musawwarat es-Sufra and Naqa. The first of these sites was given the name Meroë by the Persian king Cambyses, in honor of his sister who was called by that name. The city had originally borne the ancient appellation Saba, named after the country's original founder. The eponym Saba, or Seba, is named for one of the sons of Cush (see Genesis 10:7). The presence of numerous Meroitic sites within the western Butana region and on the border of Butana proper is significant to the settlement of the core of the developed region. The orientation of these settlements exhibit the exercise of state power over subsistence production.\nThe Kingdom of Kush which housed the city of Meroë represents one of a series of early states located within the middle Nile. It was one of the earliest and most advanced states found on the African continent. Looking at the specificity of the surrounding early states within the middle Nile, one's understanding of Meroë in combination with the historical developments of other historic states may be enhanced through looking at the development of power relation characteristics within other Nile Valley states.\nThe site of the city of Meroë is marked by more than two hundred pyramids in three groups, of which many are in ruins. They have the distinctive size and proportions of Nubian pyramids.\n\nHistory\nMeroë was the southern capital of the Kingdom of Kush. The Kingdom of Kush spanned the period c. 800 BC – c. 350 AD. Initially, its main capital was farther north at Napata. King Aspelta moved the capital to Meroë, considerably farther south than Napata, possibly c. 591 BC, just after the sack of Napata by Egyptian Pharaoh Psamtik II.\nMartin Meredith states the Kushite rulers chose Meroë, between the Fifth and Sixth Cataracts, because it was on the fringe of the summer rainfall belt, and the area was rich in iron ore and hardwood for iron working. The location also afforded access to trade routes to the Red Sea. The city of Meroë was located along the middle Nile which is of much importance due to the annual flooding of the Nile river valley and the connection to many major river systems such as the Niger which aided with the production of pottery and iron characteristic to the Meroitic kingdom that allowed for the rise in power of its people. According to partially deciphered Meroitic texts, Meroitic \"d\" was transcribed in foreign languages as \"r\", with the native name of the city being Medewi.\n\nFirst Meroitic Period (542–315 BC)\nThe Kings ruled over Napata and Meroë. The seat of government and the royal palace were in Meroë. The Main temple of Amun was located in Napata. Kings and many queens are buried in Nuri, some queens are buried in Meroë, in the West Cemetery. The earliest king was Analmaye (542–538 BC) and the last king of the first phase is Nastasen (335–315 BC)\nIn the fifth century BC, Greek historian Herodotus described it as \"a great city...said to be the mother city of the other Ethiopians.\"\nExcavations revealed evidence of important, high ranking Kushite burials from the Napatan Period (c. 800 – c. 280 BC) in the vicinity of the settlement called the Western Cemetery. The importance of the town gradually increased from the beginning of the Meroitic Period, especially from the reign of Arakamani (c. 280 BC) when the royal burial ground was transferred to Meroë from Napata (Gebel Barkal). Royal burials formed the Pyramids of Meroë, containing the remains of the Kings and Queens of Meroë from c. 300 BC to about 350 AD.\n\nSecond Meroitic Period (3rd century BC)\nThe seat of government and the royal palace are in Meroë. Kings and many queens are buried in Meroë, in the South Cemetery. Napata remained relevant for the Amun Temple. The first King of the period was Aktisanes (Early 3rd century BC) and the last king of the period was Sabrakamani (first half 3rd century BC).\n\nThird Meroitic Period (270 BC – 1st century AD)\nThe seat of government and the royal palace are in Meroë. Kings are buried in Meroë, in the North Cemetery, and Queens in West Cemetery. Napata remained relevant for the Amun Temple. Meroë flourished and many building projects were undertaken. The first king of the period is Arakamani (270–260 BC), the last ruler is Queen Amanitore (mid/late 1st century AD)\nMany artifacts were found in Meroitic tombs from around this time.\n\nConflict with Rome\nRome's conquest of Egypt led to border skirmishes and incursions by Meroë beyond the Roman borders. In 23 BC, in response to a Nubian attack on southern Egypt, the Roman governor of Egypt, Publius Petronius, invaded Nubia to end the Meroitic raids. He pillaged northern Nubia and sacked Napata (22 BC) before returning home. In retaliation, the Nubians crossed the lower border of Egypt and looted many statues from the Egyptian towns near the first cataract of the Nile at Aswan. Roman forces later reclaimed some of the statues, and others were returned following the peace treaty signed in 22 BC between Rome and Meroë under Augustus and Amanirenas, respectively. One looted head, from a statue of the emperor Augustus, was buried under the steps of a temple in Meroë; it is now kept in the British Museum.\n\nThe next recorded contact between Rome and Meroë was in the autumn of 61 AD. The Emperor Nero sent a party of Praetorian soldiers under the command of a tribune and two centurions into this country, who reached the city of Meroë where they were given an escort, then proceeded up the White Nile until they encountered the swamps of the Sudd. This marked the limit of Roman penetration into Africa.\nThe period following Petronius' punitive expedition is marked by abundant trade finds at sites in Meroë. L. P. Kirwan provides a short list of finds from archeological sites in that country. The kingdom of Meroë began to fade as a power by the 1st or 2nd century AD, sapped by the war with Roman Egypt and the decline of its traditional industries.\nMeroë is mentioned briefly in the 1st century AD Periplus of the Erythraean Sea:\n\n2. On the right-hand coast next below Berenice is the country of the Berbers. Along the shore are the Fish-Eaters, living in scattered caves in the narrow valleys. Farther inland are the Berbers, and beyond them the Wild-flesh-Eaters and Calf-Eaters, each tribe governed by its chief; and behind them, farther inland, in the country towards the west, there lies a city called Meroe.\n\nFourth Meroitic Period (1st century – 4th century AD)\nKings were buried in Meroë, in the North Cemetery, and Queens in West Cemetery. In 350 AD Meroë was destroyed by Axum. The first king of the fourth period was Shorkaror (1st century AD), while the last rulers may have been King Yesebokheamani or King Talakhidamani in the 4th century AD. The Aksumite presence was short lived before Meroë was taken by the Kingdom of Alodia.\nA stele of Ge'ez of an unnamed ruler of the Kingdom of Aksum thought to be Ezana was found at the site of Meroë; from its description, in Greek, he was \"King of the Aksumites and the Omerites,\" (i.e. of Aksum and Himyar) it is likely this king ruled sometime around 330. Another inscription in Greek gives the regnal claims of Ezana:\n\nI, Ezana, King of the Axumites and Himyarites and of Reeidan and of the Sabaites and of Sileel (?) and of Hasa and of the Bougaites and of Taimo...\nWhile some authorities interpret these inscriptions as proof that the Axumites destroyed the Kingdom of Kush, others note that archeological evidence points to an economic and political decline in Meroë around 300.\n\nMeroë in Jewish legend\nJewish oral tradition avers that Moses, in his younger years, had led an Egyptian military expedition into Sudan (Kush), as far as the city of Meroë, which was then called Saba. The city was built near the confluence of two great rivers and was encircled by a formidable wall, and governed by a renegade king. To ensure the safety of his men who traversed that desert country, Moses had invented a stratagem whereby the Egyptian army would carry along with them baskets of sedge, each containing an ibis, only to be released when they approached the enemy's country. The purpose of the birds was to kill the deadly serpents that lay all about that country. Having successfully laid siege to the city, the city was eventually subdued by the betrayal of the king's daughter, who had agreed to deliver the city to Moses on condition that he would consummate a marriage with her, under the solemn assurance of an oath.\n\nCivilization\nMeroë was the base of a flourishing kingdom whose wealth was centered around a strong iron industry. Metalworking is believed to have taken place in Meroë, possibly through bloomeries and blast furnaces. Archibald Sayce reportedly referred to it as \"the Birmingham of Africa\", because of perceived vast production and trade of iron (a contention that is a matter of debate in modern scholarship).\nThe centralized control of production within the Meroitic empire and distribution of certain crafts and manufactures may have been politically important with their iron industry and pottery crafts gaining the most significant attention. The Meroitic settlements were oriented in a savannah orientation with the varying of permanent and less permanent agricultural settlements can be attributed to the exploitation of rainlands and savannah-oriented forms of subsistence.\nAt the time, iron was one of the most important metals worldwide, and Meroitic metalworkers were among the best in the world. Meroë traded ivory, slaves, rare skins, ostrich feathers, copper, and ebony.  Meroë also exported textiles and jewelry. Their textiles were based on cotton and working on this product reached its highest achievement in Nubia around 400 BC. Furthermore, Nubia was very rich in gold. It is possible that the Egyptian word for gold, nub, was the source of name of Nubia. Trade in \"exotic\" animals from farther south in Africa was another feature of their economy.\nApart from the iron trade, pottery was a widespread and prominent industry in the Meroë kingdom. The production of fine and elaborately decorated wares was a strong tradition within the middle Nile. Such productions carried considerable social significance and are believed to be involved in mortuary rites. The long history of goods imported into the Meroitic empire and their subsequent distribution provides insight into the social and political workings of the Meroitic state. The major determinant of production was attributed to the availability of labor rather than the political power associated with land. Power was associated with control of people rather than control of territory.\nThe sakia, was used to move water, in conjunction with irrigation, to increase crop production.\nAt its peak, the rulers of Meroë controlled the Nile Valley north to south, over a straight-line distance of more than 1,000 km (620 mi).\nThe King of Meroë was an autocratic ruler who shared his authority only with the Queen Mother, or Kandake. However, the role of the Queen Mother remains obscure. The administration consisted of treasurers, seal bearers, heads of archives and chief scribes, among others.\nAlthough the people of Meroë also had southern deities such as Apedemak, the lion-son of Sekhmet (or Bast, depending upon the region), they also continued worshipping ancient Egyptian gods that they had brought with them. Among these deities were Amun, Tefnut, Horus, Isis, Thoth and Satis, though to a lesser extent.\nThe collapse of their external trade with other Nile Valley states may be considered one of the prime causes of the decline of royal power and disintegration of the Meroitic state in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD.\n\nLanguage\nThe Meroitic language was spoken in Meroë and the Sudan during the Meroitic period (attested from 300 BC). It became extinct around 400 AD. The language was written in two forms of the Meroitic alphabet: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a stylus and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of bilingual texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180 and 170 BC. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen Shanakdakhete. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally, and reads from right to left like all Semitic orthographies.\nBy the 3rd century BC, a new indigenous alphabet, the Meroitic, consisting of twenty-three letters, replaced Egyptian script. The Meroitic script is an alphabetic script originally derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs, used to write the Meroitic language of the Kingdom of Kush. It was developed in the Napatan Period (c. 700 – 300 BC), and first appears in the 2nd century BC. For a time, it was also possibly used to write the Nubian language of the successor Nubian kingdoms.\nIt is uncertain to which language family the Meroitic language is related. Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic, like the Egyptian language, belongs to the Afro-Asiatic family. She bases this on its sound inventory and phonotactics, which, she proposes, are similar to those of the Afro-Asiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the Nilo-Saharan languages. Claude Rilly, based on its syntax, morphology, and known vocabulary, proposes that Meroitic, like the Nobiin language, instead belongs to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan family.\n\nArchaeology\nThe site of Meroë was brought to the knowledge of Europeans in 1821 by the French mineralogist Frédéric Cailliaud (1787–1869), who published an illustrated in-folio describing the ruins. His work included the first publication of the southernmost known Latin inscription.\nAs Margoliouth notes in the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica, small scale excavations occurred in 1834, led by Giuseppe Ferlini, who, as Margoliouth states, \"discovered (or professed to discover) various antiquities, chiefly in the form of jewelry, now in the museums of Berlin and Munich.\" Margoliouth continues,\n\nThe ruins were examined in 1844 by C. R. Lepsius, who brought many plans, sketches and copies, besides actual antiquities, to Berlin. Further excavations were carried on by E. A. Wallis Budge in the years 1902 and 1905, the results of which are recorded in his work, The Egyptian Sudan: its History and Monuments… Troops were furnished by Sir Reginald Wingate, governor of the Sudan, who made paths to and between the pyramids, and sank shafts, &c. It was found that the pyramids were regularly built over sepulchral chambers, containing the remains of bodies either burned or buried without being mummified. The most interesting objects found were the reliefs on the chapel walls, already described by Lepsius, and containing the names with representations of queens and some kings, with some chapters of the Book of the Dead; some steles with inscriptions in the Meroitic language, and some vessels of metal and earthenware. The best of the reliefs were taken down stone by stone in 1905, and set up partly in the British Museum and partly in the museum at Khartoum. In 1910, in consequence of a report by Professor Archibald Sayce, excavations were commenced in the mounds of the town and the necropolis by J[ohn] Garstang on behalf of the University of Liverpool, and the ruins of a palace and several temples were discovered, built by the Meroite kings.\n\nWorld Heritage listing\nIn June 2011, the Archeological Sites of Meroë were listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites.\nDuring the Sudanese civil war (2023–present) on 14 January 2024, the Sudanese Armed Forces launched airstrikes in the ancient Meroitic sites of Naqa and Musawwarat es-Sufra, which are both designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites, following incursions there by the Rapid Support Forces.\n\nSee also\nSedeinga pyramids\nList of modern names for biblical place names\nKandake\n\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nFurther reading\nBianchi, Steven (1994).

          "content": "Jebel Barkal or Gebel Barkal (Arabic: جبل بركل, romanized: Jabal Barkal) is a mesa or large rock outcrop located 400 km north of Khartoum, next to Karima in Northern State in Sudan, on the Nile River, in the region that is sometimes called Nubia. The jebel is 104 m tall, has a flat top, and came to have religious significance for both ancient Kush and ancient Egyptian occupiers. In 2003, the mountain, together with the extensive archaeological site at its base (ancient Napata), were named as the center of a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The Jebel Barkal area houses the Jebel Barkal Museum.\n\nHistory\nThe earliest occupation of Jebel Barkal was that of the Kerma culture, which was also known as Kush, but this occupation is so far known only from scattered potsherds.\nAround 1450 BCE, the Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III conquered Barkal and built a fortified settlement (Egyptian menenu) there as the southern limit of the Egyptian empire. The city and region around it came to be called Napata, and the Egyptian occupation of Jebel Barkal extended through most of the New Kingdom of Egypt. The Egyptians built a complex of temples at the site, centered on a temple to Amun of Napata—a local, ram-headed form of the main god of the Egyptian capital city of Thebes, Egypt. In the last years of the New Kingdom and after its collapse in 1169 BC, there was little construction at Jebel Barkal. Apart from the temples, no trace of this Egyptian settlement has yet been found at the site.\n\nJebel Barkal was the capital city of the Kingdom of Kush as it returned to power in the years after 800 BCE as the Dynasty of Napata. The Kushite kings who conquered and ruled over Egypt as the 25th Dynasty, including Kashta, Piankhy (or Piye), and Taharqa, all built, renovated, and expanded monumental structures at the site.\nAfter the Kushites were driven out by the Assyrian conquest of Egypt in the mid-7th century BC, they continued to rule Kush with Jebel Barkal and the city of Meroë as the most important urban centers of Kush. Jebel Barkal's palaces and temples continued to be renovated from the 7th-early 3rd centuries BC. Most of the royal pyramid burials of the kings and queens of Kush during this time were built at the site of Nuri, 9 km to the northeast of Jebel Barkal.\nIn 270 BCE, the location of Kushite royal burials was moved to Meroë, inaugurating the Meroitic period of the Kingdom of Kush. Jebel Barkal continued to be an important city of Kush during the Meroitic period. A sequence of palaces were built, most notably by King Natakamani, new temples were built and older temples were renovated. During the 1st century BC - 1st century AD, eight royal pyramid burials were built at Jebel Barkal (rather than at Meroë), for reasons that are not clear, but perhaps reflecting the prominence of one or more families from the city.\nAfter the collapse of Kush during the 4th century AD, Jebel Barkal continued to be occupied in the medieval (Christian) period of Nubia, as attested by architectural remains, burials, and burial inscriptions.\n\nTemples\nThe ruins around Jebel Barkal include at least 13 temples that were built, renovated, and expanded over a period of over 1,500 years. The temples were described for the first time by a series of European explorers beginning in the 1820s. Their drawings and descriptions, particularly those of Frédéric Cailliaud (1821), Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds (1821), and Karl Richard Lepsius (1844), record significant architectural details that have since disappeared. In 1862 five inscriptions from the Third Intermediate Period were recovered by an Egyptian officer and transported to the Cairo Museum, but not until 1916 were scientific archeological excavations performed by a joint expedition of Harvard University and the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston under the direction of George Reisner. From the 1970s, explorations continued by a team from the University of Rome La Sapienza, under the direction of Sergio Donadoni, that was joined by another team from the Boston Museum, in the 1980s, under the direction of Timothy Kendall.\n\nTemple of Amun and Temple of Mut\nThe larger temples, such as the Temple of Amun, are even today considered sacred to the local population. The carved wall painted chambers of the Temple of Mut are well preserved.\n\nTemple B700 at Jebel Barkal\nTemple B700, built by Atlanersa and decorated by Senkamanisken, is now largely destroyed. It received the sacred bark of Amun from the nearby B500 on certain cultic occasions, and may have served during the coronation of the kings of the early Napatan period, in the mid 7th century BC. The Temple was decorated by Senkamanisken, where he is shown clubbing enemies.\nThe hieroglyphic inscription on the Temple described the role of the god Amun in selecting Senkamanisken as king:\n\nI said of you [while you were still] in your mother's womb that you were to be ruler of Kemet [\"Black Land\", probably meaning Egypt and Kush]. I knew you in the semen, while you were in the egg, that you were to be lord. I made you receive the Great Crown, which Re caused to appear on the first good occasion. [Inasmuch as] a father makes his son excellent, it is I who decreed kingship to you. [So] who shall share it with you? For I am the Lord of Heaven. As I give to Re, [so] he gives to his children, from gods to men. It is I who gives you the royal charter.... No other [can] decree (who is to be) king. It is I who grants kingship to whomever I will.\n\nPyramids\nJebel Barkal served as a royal cemetery during the Meroitic Kingdom.

There are no traces of a pre-Egyptian settlement, though this may change as more is uncovered at the site. The earliest buildings found at Napata date from the middle of the eighteenth Dynasty. The first archaeologist to work at the site was George A. Reisner who worked there from 1916-1920 and excavated a number of buildings. His first excavation at Napata was a large Meroitic structure (Named “B 100”) that dated to the first century CE. At first, Reisner assumed this to be an “administrative building”, though it is now known to have been a palace.\n\nArtifacts in Museums\nSee also\nList of World Heritage Sites in Africa\nNubian pyramids\nPyramids at El-Kurru\nPyramids of Jebel Barkal\nPyramids of Meroë\nPyramids of Nuri\nSedeinga pyramids\n\nReferences\nSources\nReisner, George Andrew (1925). \"Excavations in Egypt and Ethiopia 1922–1925\" (PDF).

          "content": "Nuri is a place in modern Sudan on the west side of the Nile, near the Fourth Cataract. Nuri is situated about 15 km north of Sanam, and 10 km from Jebel Barkal.\n\nHistory\nNuri is the second of three Napatan burial sites and the construction of pyramids at Nuri began when there was no longer enough space at El-Kurru. More than 20 ancient pyramids belonging to Nubian kings and queens are still standing at Nuri, which served as a royal necropolis for the ancient city of Napata, the first capital of the Nubian Kingdom of Kush. It is probable that, at its apex, 80 or more pyramids stood at Nuri, marking the tombs of royals. The pyramids at Nuri were built over a period of more than three centuries, from circa 670 BCE for the oldest (pyramid of Taharqa), to around 310 BCE (pyramid of king Nastasen).  \n\nThe earliest known pyramid (Nu. 1) at Nuri belongs to king Taharqa which measures 51.75 meters square by 40 or by 50 metres high. The pyramid of Taharqa was situated so that when observed from Jebel Barkal at sunrise on Egyptian New Year's Day, the beginning of the annual flooding of the Nile, the sun would rise from the horizon directly over its point.\nTantamani, successor of Taharqa, was buried at el-Kurru, but all following Napatan kings and many of their queens and children until Nastasen (Nu. 15) (about 315 BC) were buried here, some 80 royals. The pyramids at Nuri are, in general, smaller than the Egyptian ones and are today often heavily degraded (caused by both humans and nature), but often still contained substantial parts of the funerary equipment of the Kushite rulers who were buried here. During the Christian era, a church was erected here. The church was built at least in part from reused pyramid stones, including several stelae originally coming from the pyramid chapels.\nThe pyramids were partially excavated by George Reisner in the early 20th century. In 2018, a new archaeological expedition began work at the site, directed by Pearce Paul Creasman.\nThe pyramids of Nuri, together with other buildings in the region around Gebel Barkal, have been placed on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites since 2003.\n\nTombs at Nuri\nSee List of monarchs of Kush for more information.\n\nThe royal family of Kush was buried in the cemeteries of Nuri and el-Kurru.\nThe King's Mothers were buried in the southern group, but this is not an area exclusively used for the burial of King's Mothers. Most of the King's Wives were buried in the parallel rows just north of Taharqa's tomb. The tombs to the far north were much smaller and may have been built for wives of lesser rank. It was also found by Dows Dunham, an experienced archaeologist, that there were references to two other kings in three of the pyramids including King Taharqa. But, if they are buried there, their tombs have yet to be located and excavated.\n\n Nuri 1 – King Taharqa, the earliest and largest of the Nuri pyramids\n Nuri 2 – King Amaniastabarqa\n Nuri 3 – King Senkamanisken\n Nuri 4 – King Siaspiqa\n Nuri 5 – King Malonaqen\n  Nuri 6 – King Anlamani, son of King Senkamanisken\n Nuri 7 – King Karkamani\n Nuri 8 – King Aspelta, son of King Senkamanisken and Queen Naparaye\n Nuri 9 – King Aramatle-qo, son of Aspelta\nNuri 10 – King Amaninatakilebte\n Nuri 11 – King Malewiebamani\n Nuri 12 – King Amanineteyerike, son of King Malewiebamani\n Nuri 13 – King Harsiotef\n Nuri 14 – King Akhraten\n Nuri 15 – King Nastasen\n Nuri 16 – King Talakhamani\n Nuri 17 – King Baskakeren, son of King Malewiebamani\n Nuri 18 – King Analmaye\n Nuri 19 – King Nasakhma\n Nuri 20 – King Atlanersa, Son of Taharqa\nNuri 21 – Possibly Takahatenamun, Queen.

It is noted that looting was present in all of the pyramids as they were accessible by digging a hole through the ground. Based on objects found within and around the tombs, it is likely that these looters came hundreds of years later. Of what remained, several fragments and completed Napatan red ware pottery were found within several tombs.\n\nSee also\nNubian pyramids\nPyramids at El-Kurru\nPyramids of Jebel Barkal\nPyramids of Meroë\nSedeinga pyramids\n\nReferences\nLiterature\nDows Dunham.

          "content": "El-Kurru was the first of the three royal cemeteries used by the Kushite royals of Napata, also referred to as Egypt's 25th Dynasty, and is home to some of the royal Nubian Pyramids. It is located between the 3rd and 4th cataracts of the Nile about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the river in what is now Northern state, Sudan. El-Kurru was first excavated by George Reisner in 1918 and 1919 and after his death his assistant Dows Dunham took over his work and published the excavation report on El-Kurru in 1950. The El Kurru cemetery was primarily used from about 860 BC until 650 BC. The first tomb with a name attached to it is that of King Piye (also known as King Piankhy) dating to about 750 BC, the sixteen earlier tombs possibly belong to Piye's royal predecessors. The last 25th dynasty king, Tantamani, was buried at El Kurru around 650 BC. The subsequent Napatan rulers chose to be buried at the royal cemetery at Nuri instead. However, in the mid-4th century the 20th king, whose name is unknown, chose to have his tomb, as well as that of his queen, built at El Kurru.\n\nHistory and description\nReisner thought that the earliest tomb, Tum.1, dated back to the time of Pharaoh Sheshonq I of Ancient Egypt (c. 860 BC) and predates the Kingdom of Napata by some 200 years. At the present, some scholars (Hakem, Torok) think the early cemetery stretches back to the Ramesside period and date the earliest burials to the end of the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt (c. 1070 BC). However, other scholars, including Kendall, more or less agree with Reisner's chronology, and move the date of initial use to 850-830 BC as opposed to Reisner's proposed date of 860 BC.\nThe cemetery is divided into three parts by two wadis. The central section seems to be the oldest and contains several tumulus type tombs that predate the Kingdom of Napata. The highest part of the cemetery contains four tumulus tombs (Tum. 1, 2, 4 and 5). Tum. 6 is located to the north, across the northern wadi. To the east of the tumuli is a row of at least eight pyramids. One of them partially intrudes on a tumulus tomb (Tum. 19). According to Dunham and Reisner, the southernmost of this row of pyramids (Ku.8) belongs to King Kashta and (presumably to) his wife Pebatjma, and tomb Ku.9 belongs to King Alara, however there are no written records of names associated with these tombs. Before this row is another row of pyramids which includes those of Piye, Shabaka and Tantamani.\nThe southern pyramids are located to the south of the pyramid of Pebatjma, across the southern wadi. These are the pyramids of the Queens: Naparaye (Ku.3), Khensa  (Ku.4), Qalhata (Ku.5), and Ku.6 which possibly belongs to Arty.\nAs mentioned previously, not all of the tombs at El-Kurru are pyramids. Tombs Tum. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (tum. standing for tumulus), and Ku.19 are all Nubian style tumuli that consist of a rock-cut pit covered by a circular mound of gravel, pebbles, and rubble. This style of tumulus is also seen in C-Group burials and at burials at Kerma. However, the style of the tumuli changed with time. Tum.6 and Ku.19 both have circular enclosure walls, which are sturdier than the rubble piles that topped the previous tombs, and had offering chapels. The following ten tombs built, Ku. 14, 13, 11, 10, 9, 23, 21, 8, 20, 7, also had offering chapels (except for Ku.21 and Ku.20) and had square plan rather than circular. Reisner believed that these square tombs were mastabas, flat topped structures, but scholars Lohwasser and Kendall argue that they were actually topped with small pyramids that were removed when the tombs were looted. King Piye's tomb (Ku.17) marks another change in the building style of the tombs at El-Kurru, he was buried in a vaulted chamber that was both rock cut and built with stone masonry. The royal pyramids built after King Piye's were similarly monumental and King Tanwetamani (Ku.16) and Queen Qalhata's (Ku.5) tombs are even exquisitely painted with scenes of the Egyptian underworld. Unfortunately, both the interior and exterior of almost all of the tombs at El-Kurru were looted, leaving the tombs in disrepair. However, the artifacts that were left behind indicate that these rulers were incredibly wealthy and successful.\nIn the medieval period, when the region was part of the Christian kingdom of Makuria, El-Kurru constituted a walled settlement functioning until about 1200. In this period, Christian Nubians carved various graffiti into pyramid Ku. 1, including monograms, Christian symbols and, most remarkably, a multitude of boats, perhaps commemorating \"some kind of river procession.\"\n\nPyramids and tombs at El-Kurru\nTum. 1, dates to 860-840 BC, no names found associated with the tomb.\nTum. 2, dates to 800-780 BC, the tomb contained a female skull, no names found associated with the tomb.\nTum. 4, dates to 860-840 BC, no names found associated with the tomb.\nTum. 5, dates to 860-840 BC, no names found associated with the tomb.\nTum. 6, dates to 840-820 BC, tomb located to the north of Tum.1, across the northern wadi.

It is located just south and adjacent to the pyramid of Piye (K.17)\nKu.2 – dates to 362-342 BC, belongs to an unknown queen, likely the queen of the unknown king buried in Ku.1.\n\nHorse burials\nSome 120 metres (390 ft) to the north-west of pyramids K.51–K.55, four rows of graves were found which contained horse burials (Ku.201-224). The rows contained four, eight, eight, and four graves respectively. The four graves in the first row likely date to the time of Piye, the tombs in the second row date to the time of Shabaka, the tombs in the third row date to the time of Shebitqo, and the tombs in the fourth and last row date to the time of Tantamani.\nThe tombs had all been robbed, but enough remained to determine that the horses were all buried in an upright position. The horses were buried with all their trappings.\n\nRecent archaeological work\nIn 2013 archaeological work once again commenced at El Kurru. In collaboration with the National Council for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM), and partially funded by the Qatar Sudan Archaeological Project (QSAP), Dr. Geoff Emberling (Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, Michigan) and Dr. Rachael J. Dann (Associate Professor, Egyptian & Sudanese Archaeology, University of Copenhagen) co-direct excavation, survey, documentation and conservation work at the site.

The ancient city lies about 170 km (110 miles) north-east of Khartoum, and about 50 km (31 miles) east of the Nile River located at approximately MGRS 36QWC290629877. Here smaller wadis meet the Wadi Awateib coming from the center of the Butana plateau region, and further north at Wad ban Naqa from where it joins the Nile. Naqa was only a camel or donkey's journey from the Nile, and could serve as a trading station on the way to the east; thus it had strategic importance.\nNaqa is one of the largest ruined sites in the country and indicates an important ancient city once stood in the location. It was one of the centers of the Kingdom of Meroë,  which served as a bridge between the Mediterranean world and Africa. The site has two notable temples, one devoted to Amun and the other to Apedemak which also has a Roman kiosk nearby. With Meroë and Musawwarat es-Sufra it is known as the Island of Meroe, and was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.\n\nResearch\nThe first European travellers reached Naqa in 1822, before Hermann von Pückler-Muskau did in 1837. In 1843, it was visited by Richard Lepsius and his Prussian Egypt-Sudan expedition. He copied some of the inscriptions and representations of the temple standing here. In 1958 a team from Berlin's Humboldt University visited Naqa and documented the temple and restored part of the site along with the nearby site of Musawwarat es-Sufra in the 1960s.\nSince 1995, Naqa has been excavated by a German-Polish team with the participation of the Egyptian Museum of Berlin and the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. It is directed by Professor Dietrich Wildung and is financed by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) and also includes Polish archaeologist Professor Lech Krzyżaniak, and a small group of Polish archaeologists from Poznań. Krzyżaniak later received the Grand Officer of the Order of the Two Niles in 2002 for his work.\n\nStructure\nNaqa comprises several Meroitic temples dating to 4th century BC to 4th century AD. The remains of various temples were found, but the two largest and most significant temples of Naqa are the Amun and Apedemak temples, also known as the Temple of the Lion. Both are still well preserved.\n\nTemple of Amun\nThe Amun temple of Naqa was founded by King Natakamani and is 100 metres in length and has several statues of the ruler. The temple is aligned on an east-west axis and is made of sandstone, which has been somewhat eroded by the wind. The temple is designed in the Egyptian style, with an outer court and colonnade of rams similar to the Temple of Amun at Jebel Barkal and Karnak, and leads to a hypostyle hall containing the inner sanctuary (naos). The main entrances and walls of the temple contain relief carvings.\nIn 1999 the German-Polish archaeology team explored the area of the inner sanctuary of the temple. The reverse and sides of the stela contain undeciphered Meroitic hieroglyphs and is considered by the discovery team to be one of the best examples of Meroitic art found to date. After excavation, reconstruction and measurement of the temple of Amun for over a decade, on 1 December 2006, the Sudanese authorities regained management, giving responsibility to the Ministry of Culture.\nAnother Amun temple named Naqa 200 and located on the slope of the nearby Gebel Naqa, the mountain overlooking the settlement of Naqa, has been excavated since 2004. It was built by Amanikhareqerem and is similar to the Temple of Natakamani and is dated to the 2nd or 3rd century AD, although some finds do not correspond to the precise dating, adding to an already fuzzy understanding of Nubian chronology.\n\nTemple of Apedemak\nLocated to the west of the temple of Amun is the temple of Apedemak (or the Lion Temple). Apedemak  was a lion-headed warrior god worshipped in Nubia. The god was used as a sacred guardian of the deceased hereditary chief, prince or king.  Anyone who touched the chief's grave was said to be cursed by this Apedemak.\nThe temple is considered a classic example of Kushite architecture. The front of the temple is an extensive gateway, and depicts Natakamani and Amanitore on the left and right exerting divine power over their prisoners, symbolically with lions at their feet. Who the prisoners are exactly is unclear, although historical records have revealed that the Kushites frequently clashed with invading desert clans. Towards the edges are fine representations of Apedemak who is represented by a snake emerging from a lotus flower. On the sides of the temple are depictions of the gods Amun, Horus and Apedemak keeping company in the presence of the king. On the rear wall of the temple is the largest depiction of the lion god, and is illustrated receiving offering from the king and queen. He is depicted as a three-headed god with four arms. The north-front shows the goddesses Isis, Mut, Hathor, Amesemi and Satet.\n\nRoman kiosk\nThe Roman kiosk is a small temple near the main temple building, which has strong Greco-Roman  Hellenistic elements. The entrance to the kiosk is Egyptian and is topped by a lintel with a row of sacred uraeus (cobras) but the sides consist of columns with florid Corinthian capitals and arched windows in the Roman style. Recent excavations at the building showed that it was probably devoted to the worship of Hathor. The goddess Isis was known to have absorbed some characteristics of Hathor.\n\nOther\nStanding at the foot of the sandstone cliffs of Jabal Naqa is the temple named \"500\". It was built by Shanakdakhete around 135 BC, making it the oldest building on the site. The texts on the temple walls are the oldest known writings in Meroitic hieroglyphs. Judging by the reliefs, the temple was dedicated to the Theban triad of Amun, Mut, and Khonsu, as well as Apedemak. In 1834, Giuseppe Ferlini discovered treasure which was severely damaged. A thorough excavation and restoration has been made since.\n\nSee also\nNortheast Africa\n\nReferences\nLiterature\nDietrich Wildung; Karla Kroeper (2006), Naga - Royal City of Ancient Sudan (in German), Berlin: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin - Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz, ISBN 3-88609-558-4\nBasil Davidson  Old Africa Rediscovered, Gollancz, 1959\nPeter Shinnie Meroe, 1967\n\nExternal links\n\nTemple decoration images\nAn extensive collection of photographs\nPhotos from 1905–1907.

It is located in a large basin surrounded by low sandstone hills in the western Butana, 180 km northeast of Khartoum, 20 km north of Naqa and approximately 25 km south-east of the Nile. With Meroë and Naqa it is known as the Island of Meroe, and was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011. Constructed in sandstone, the main features of the site include the Great Enclosure, the Lion Temple of Apedemak and the Great Reservoir. Most significant is the number of representations of elephants, suggesting that this animal played an important role at Musawwarat es-Sufra.\n\nResearch\nThe site of Musawwarat es-Sufra was originally mentioned by Linant de Bellefonds in 1822, and then shortly thereafter by Frédéric Cailliaud. The first detailed description of the site was made by Carl Richard Lepsius. Archaeological fieldwork was conducted by the Butana expedition of the Humboldt University of Berlin under the direction of archaeologist Fritz Hintze from 1960 until 1970. The team re-erected the Lion Temple, collapsed in antiquity, and constructed a new roof. These investigations continued after a gap of several decades and are ongoing.\n\nLion Temple\nThe Lion Temple is a single-chambered rectangular 14.21 m in length, 9.13 m in width and 4.7 m in height temple with pylon and six columns made of drums. Erected by King Arnekhamani and dedicated to Apedemak the temple bears inscriptions in Egyptian hieroglyphs and representations of elephants and lions on the rear inside wall as well as reliefs of Apedemak depicted as a three-headed god on the outside walls. A 3D model of the Lion Temple can be seen here. An Animation of the Lion Temple 3D model can be view here.\n\nGreat Enclosure\nThe Great Enclosure is the main structure of the site. Much of the large labyrinth-like building complex, which covers approximately 45,000 m2, was erected in the third century BC.  According to Hintze, \"the complicated ground plan of this extensive complex of buildings is without parallel in the entire Nile valley\".  The maze of courtyards includes three (possible) temples, passages, low walls, preventing any contact with the outside world, about 20 columns, ramps and two reservoirs.\nThere were many sculptures of animals, such as elephants and most of the walls of the complex bear graffiti and masons’ or pilgrims' marks both pictorial and in Meroitic or Greek script. The scheme of the site is, so far, without parallel in Nubia and ancient Egypt, and there is some debate about the purpose of the buildings, with earlier suggestions including a college, a hospital, and an elephant-training camp.  According to the scholar Basil Davidson, at least four Kushite queens — Amanirenas, Amanishakheto, Nawidemak and Amanitore — probably spent part of their lives in Musawwarat es-Sufra.\n\nGreat Reservoir\nThe Great Reservoir is a Hafir to retain as much as possible of the rainfall of the short, wet season. It is 250 m in diameter and excavated 6.3 m into the ground.\n\n3D Models with laser-scanning\nThe Zamani Project document cultural heritage sites in 3D to create a record for future generations. The documentation of the Great Enclosure of Musawwarat es-Sufra and the Apedemak (Lion) Temple is based on terrestrial laser-scanning  and was carried out in 2009. 3D models, animations, plans and images of some of the temples are online available at www.zamaniproject.org\n\nReferences\nLiterature\nBasil Davidson  Old Africa Rediscovered, Gollancz, 1959.\nJochen Hallof, Die Baustufen I bis IV der Großen Anlage von Musawwarat es Sufra, 2006.\nPeter Shinnie Meroe, 1967.\nSteffen Wenig (ed.), Die Tempel von Musawwarat es Sufra, 1996.\n\nExternal links\n\nThe Musawwarat graffiti archive\nwww.musawwarat.com Archaeological Mission to Musawwarat es-Sufra: Project website with basic information and current publications\nAncient Sudan Meroe Gallery\nYoutube 3D fly through\nDocumentary film on archaeological research and conservation at Musawwarat es-Sufra by Humboldt University, Berlin",

          "title": "Old Dongola",
          "content": "Old Dongola (Old Nubian: ⲧⲩⲛⲅⲩⲗ, Tungul; Arabic: دنقلا العجوز, Dunqulā al-ʿAjūz) is a deserted Nubian town in what is now Northern State, Sudan, located on the east bank of the Nile opposite the Wadi Howar. An important city in medieval Nubia, and the departure point for caravans west to Darfur and Kordofan, from the fourth to the fourteenth century Old Dongola was the capital of the Makurian state. A Polish archaeological team has been excavating the town since 1964.\nThe urban center of the population moved downstream 80 km (50 miles) to the opposite side of the Nile during the nineteenth century, becoming the modern Dongola.\n\nHistory\nFoundation and heyday\nThe archaeological site encompassing Old Dongola has about 200 ha. Its southern part features a citadel and urban buildings, while in the north, splendid suburban residences have been uncovered. There are also cemeteries associated with subsequent phases of the town's functioning, including Islamic domed tombs.\nOld Dongola was founded in the fifth century as a fortress. On the citadel, which was the royal residence, numerous palaces and public buildings were located. In the mid-sixth century with the arrival of Christianity it became the capital of Makuria, The town was further expanded, including the area outside the citadel. Several churches were built. These include, to use the names contemporary archeologists have given them, Building X and the Church with the Stone Pavement. These two structures were erected about 100 meters apart from the walled town centre, indicating that at this time the town already extended over the original walls of the fortress. Building X was soon replaced by the Old Church.\n\nIn the middle of the seventh century, the two main churches were destroyed, but rebuilt soon after. Building material was taken from the Old Church and used to repair the city walls. Archeologists believe this destruction is evidence of the First (642) and Second Battles of Dongola (652).\n\nAt the end of the seventh Century, the Church of the Granite Columns was erected over the Old Church. Adorned with 16 granite columns, each with richly decorated granite capitals, the Church of the Granite Columns perhaps was the cathedral of Old Dongola.\nThe city's heyday was in the ninth–eleventh centuries, but building activity lasted until the fourteenth century. The Church of the Stone Pavements was replaced with the Cruciform Church at this time. Other buildings in use in Old Dongola at this time include many other churches, at least two palaces, and a sizable monastery on its north side. Several houses were well equipped and had bath rooms and wall paintings.\n\nThe Book of Knowledge, a travelogue compiled by a Spanish monk soon after 1348, mentions that Genoese merchants had settled in Old Dongola; they may have penetrated there as a consequence of the commercial treaty of 1290 between Genoa and Egypt.\n\nThe Great Monastery of St Anthony\nAbout 1.5 km to the north-east of the citadel lies the so-called Kom H where the monastery was uncovered. According to the inscription it is dedicated to St Anthony the Great but the Monastery of the Holy Trinity is also referred to in literature. It was probably one of the first Christian building projects in Dongola. Archbishop of Dongola, Georgios, who died in 1113, was buried in one of the crypts in the church. The inscription on his funerary stela indicates that St Anthony the Great was the patron of the monastery. In the rich assemblage of texts in Greek, Coptic, and Old Nubian found in the archbishop's crypt, a dedication to the Holy Trinity also appears.\nApproximately 100 compositions, dated to the eleventh–thirteenth century, were uncovered on the walls of the monastery buildings. Many of these paintings are unique, both from the artistic and iconographical point of view. They depicted Christ, Mary, the Apostles, scenes from the Old and New Testament, as well as dignitaries.\n\nThe Throne Hall\nThe monumental representative building interpreted as the Throne Hall of the Makurian kings is a massive defence-like building of 28 m by 18 m by 12 m situated on a rocky spur to the east from the fortress. It was built in the 9th century. The building had two stories; the height of the walls was 6.5 m on the ground floor and 3.5 m on the upper floor. In 1317 it was turned into a mosque, an event which is preserved in a foundation stela erected by Sayf al-Din Abdullah Barshambu. The ceremonial Throne Hall on the first floor was turned into a prayer room. The mosque remained in use until 1969, when the building was converted in a historic monument.\n\nDecline\nDuring the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the town was in decline. It was attacked by Arabs several times. A surviving inscription erected in Old Dongola bears the date of 1317, is commonly understood to be the record of a military expedition sent by the Sultan of Egypt to place his nominee Abdullah, perhaps a Muslim Nubian, on the throne. The royal court left Dongola in 1364.\n\nUnder the Funj, Old Dongola became the capital of the Northern provinces. The French traveller Charles-Jacques Poncet visited the city in 1699, and in his memoirs he described it as located on the slope of a sandy hill. His description of Old Dongola continues:\n\nThe houses are ill built, and the streets half deserted and fill'd with heaps of sand, occasion'd by floods from the mountains. The castle is in the very center of the town. It is large and spacious, but the fortifications are inconsiderable. It keeps in awe the Arabians, who are masters of the open country.\nIntensive trade relations with the Far East, as well as Europe, continued in this period. However, trade declined after the rise of the Shaigiya Confederacy. In 1812, the Mamluks fled to Sudan to escape purges in Egypt and conquered Old Dongola. They founded the city of New Dongola downriver, which grew in size, shifting the economic and trade center of the region away from Old Dongola.\n\nIslamic cemetery\nA large Islamic cemetery with numerous qubbas, erected in the 17th century, testify to the importance of Old Dongola also in postmedieval times.\n\nPolish archaeological expedition to Old Dongola\nPolish archaeological and conservation works in Dongola were initiated by Kazimierz Michałowski. The Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw has conducted research at the site since 1964, with the support of the Sudanese National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums. The first head of the expedition was architect Antoni Ostrasz. Later, Stefan Jakobielski and Włodzimierz Godlewski directed the works for 60 years. Since 2017, the \"UMMA: Urban Metamorphosis of the community of a Medieval African capital city\" project (ERC Starting Grant), headed by Artur Obłuski, has been active in studies of the youngest layers of the site.\nIn May 2021, archaeologists led by Obłuski announced the discovery of a new church's apse decorated with paintings describing two rows of colossal figures, as well as an attached wall and the nearby dome of a large tomb in Old Dongola, which might have been a cathedral and the largest known church from medieval Nubia. Obłuski reported: \"The apse is about 9 meters deep. This means that the eastern part of the building has been preserved to the impressive height of three floors of a typical block of flats. And this gives a great chance that there are more paintings and inscriptions under our feet, just like in Faras\". In February 2023, the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology headed by Obłuski announced the discovery of Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs inscribed on stone blocks and figural decorations as elements from a Pharaonic temple. Further, the Polish archaeologists discovered various unusual wall paintings probably from the thirteenth century. One of these paintings is a portrait of the Virgin Mary, and another depicts a scene with the archangel Michael and a Nubian king. Holding the king in his arms, the archangel presents him to Jesus sitting on a cloud and extending a hand for the king to kiss. “This is completely uncommon for Byzantine Christian art, which generally does not show a lot of interaction or contact between mortals and immortals,” said team leader Artur Obłuski.\n\nNotes\nSee also\n2021 in archaeology\n\nReferences\nGodlewski, W.

          "content": "Kerma was the capital city of the Kerma culture, which was founded in present-day Sudan before 3500 BC. Kerma is one of the largest archaeological sites in ancient Nubia. It has produced decades of extensive excavations and research, including thousands of graves and tombs and the residential quarters of the main city surrounding the Western, or Lower, Deffufa.\nThe locale that is now Kerma was first settled by hunter-gatherers around 8350 BC, during the Mesolithic. Between 5550 BC and 5150 BC, the site was mostly abandoned, possibly due to decreased Nile flow during this time interval. A second hiatus in occupation occurred between 4050 BC and 3450 BC, likely as a result of minimal flow from the White Nile. Around 3000 BC, agriculture developed and a cultural tradition began around Kerma. Kerma later developed into a large urban center that was built around a large adobe temple known as the Western Deffufa, which was built after 1750 BC. A state society formed between 2550 BC and 1550 BC, with a significant decrease in cattle breeding being evidenced by the archaeological record around 1750 BC. Evidence for copper metallurgy appears from c. 2200–2000 BC. As a capital city and location of royal burials, Kerma sheds light on the complex social structure present in this society.\n\nSettlement periods\nPre-Kerma (c. 3500–2500 BC) No C-Group culture Phase\nEarly Kerma (c. 2500–2050 BC) C-Group Phase Ia–Ib\nMiddle Kerma (c. 2050–1750 BC) C-Group Phase Ib–IIa\nClassic Kerma (c. 1750–1580 BC) C-Group Phase IIb–III\nFinal Kerma (c. 1580–1500 BC) C-Group Phase IIb–III\nLate Kerma – \"New Kingdom\" (c. 1500–1100? BC) \"New Kingdom\"\n\nKerma and its artifacts\nBy 1700 BC, Kerma was host to a population of at least 10,000 people. Different to those of ancient Egypt in theme and composition, Kerma's artefacts are characterized by extensive amounts of blue faience, which the Kermans developed techniques to work with independently of Egypt, and by their work with glazed quartzite and architectural inlays.\n\nKerma's cemetery and royal tombs\nKerma contains a cemetery with over 30,000 graves. The cemetery shows a general pattern of larger graves ringed by smaller ones, suggesting social stratification. The site includes at its southern boundary burial mounds, with four extending upwards of 90 metres (300 feet) in diameter. These are believed to be the graves of the city's final kings, some of which contain motifs and artwork reflecting Egyptian deities such as Horus. Generally, influence from Egypt may be observed in numerous burials, especially with regards to material evidence such as pottery and grave goods. For example, Second Intermediate Egyptian ceramics from Avaris, such as Tell el-Yahudiyeh Ware, have been discovered within Kerma burials. In addition, artifacts such as scarab seals and amulets are prolific, indicating extensive trade with ancient Egypt as well as an exchange of cultural ideas. After the sacking of Kerma, the cemetery was used to host the kings of the 25th or \"Napatan\" dynasty of the Kingdom of Kush from Upper (Southern) Nubia.\n\nReligious tradition\nSome scholars note an animistic tradition rather than a polytheistic one in pre-New Kingdom Kerma, in contrast to the later Napatan and Meroitic periods: animals depicted during the Classical Kerma period do not show anthropomorphic features like their Egyptian counterparts, and mesas like Jebel Barkal were treated in animistic fashion,  After the New Kingdom Egyptian takeover of Upper Nubia, anthropomorphic deities came to prominence. This cultural exchange was bidirectional, as New Kingdom Egyptians began to treat Jebel Barkal as a sacred site, a tradition they likely learned from the indigenous Kerma culture.\n\nArchaeology\nEarly 20th century\nEarly archaeology at Kerma started with an Egyptian and Sudanese survey by George Reisner, an American with joint appointments at Harvard University and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Reisner later led these two institutions in the so-called \"Harvard-Boston\" expedition during three field seasons at Kerma (1913–1916). He worked in Egypt and Sudan for 25 years, 1907–1932. \nAs Kerma was one of the earliest sites to be excavated in this region, Reisner's contributions to the region's archaeology are fundamental. A basic chronology of Kerman culture was established based on the work of Reisner's Harvard-Boston expedition; this provided the scaffolding for all other findings in the region. Reisner's precise excavation techniques, site reports, and other publications made later reinterpretation of his results possible.\n\nThe Lower/Western Deffufa (a massive tomb structure) was found closer to the river (19°36'2\"N, 30°24'37\"E); the Upper/Eastern Deffufa is a few kilometers away from the river in a cemetery (19°36'15\"N, 30°26'41\"E). The deceased in most burials were slightly flexed, lying on their sides. Reisner saw many links to ancient Egyptian culture through his architectural techniques and the dimensions of the Lower/Western Deffufa's base (52.3 m × 26.7 m, or 150 × 100 Egyptian cubits). He assumed it was a fort. He did not conduct further excavations of the settlement suspected to surround the Lower Deffuffa.\nThe Upper/Eastern Deffufa was located amidst thousands of low, round graves, with clear stylistic differences among the northern, middle, and southern parts of the cemetery. The most elaborate tombs were found in the southern part. Reisner assumed that the large, quadrangular deffufa structures were funerary chapels associated with the largest mound graves, not tombs per se. He interpreted these based on his knowledge of ancient Egyptian funerary practices, and since many of the grave goods found were Egyptian, he had no reason to think otherwise.\nReisner fit this archaeology into his understanding of ancient life along the Nile, assuming that Kerma was a satellite city of the ancient Egyptians. It was not until the late 20th century that excavations by Charles Bonnet and the University of Geneva confirmed that this was not the case. They instead uncovered a vast independent urban complex that ruled most of the Third Cataract for centuries.\n\nLate 20th century to present\nDecades after Reisner's excavations, Bonnet's refutation of the idea that Kerma was an Egyptian satellite city was accepted. \"The patient and diligent work of Bonnet and his colleagues unearthed the foundations of numerous houses, workshops, and palaces, proving that as early as 2000 BC Kerma was a large urban center, presumably the capital city and a burial ground of the kings of Kush.\" From 1977 to 2003, Bonnet and an international team of scholars excavated at Kerma.\nBonnet's Swiss team has excavated the following types of sites at Kerma: ancient town, princely tomb, temple, residential/administrative buildings, Napatan buildlings, a Napatan potter's workshop, Meroitic cemeteries, fortifications, and Neolithic grain pits and huts. Among many other unique finds, Bonnet uncovered a bronze forge in the main city. \"It is within the walls of the religious center that a bronze workshop was built. The workshop consisted of multiple forges and the artisans' techniques appear to have been quite elaborate. There is no comparable discovery in Egypt or in Sudan to help us interpret these remains.\"\nIn 2003, Bonnet and his archaeological team discovered black granite statues of pharaohs of Egypt's Twenty-fifth Dynasty near Kerma. The statues are displayed onsite in the Kerma Museum.\n\nBioarchaeology\nMortuary practices in Kerma varied over time, as can be seen in the archaeological record. The large cemetery around the Upper/Eastern Deffufa is arranged with older graves in the northern part and more-recent (and -complex) graves and tombs in the southern part. \"In the Early Kerma period, 2500-2050 BC, burials are marked by a low, circular superstructure of slabs of black sandstone, stuck into the ground in concentric circles. White quartz pebbles reinforce the structure.\" Smaller burials surround larger tombs of important individuals. Tombs progress from simple mounds to Egyptian-inspired pyramid complexes. This transition did not begin until long after pyramids fell out of fashion in Egypt.\nBonnet notes that sacrificial victims appear and become increasingly common in the Middle Kerma period. Because burial chambers can be easily entered, one could question the likelihood of the sacrifice of a wife and/or child when a man dies without any ethnohistorical evidence to support this in the culture. In fact Buzon and Judd question this assumption by analyzing traumata and indicators of skeletal stress in these \"sacrificial victims.\"\nMost skeletons have been found in a slightly contracted or contracted position on their sides. Because of the arid desert climate, natural mummification is very common. Without the normal processes of decomposition to skeletonize the body, soft tissues, hairs, and organic grave goods are still often found (e.g., textiles, feathers, leather, fingernails). Grave goods include faience beads, cattle skulls, and pottery. Skeletal collections, like other archaeological evidence, continue to be re-examined and re-interpreted as new research questions arise. Two recent studies highlight the kinds of questions that bioarchaeologists are asking of the skeletal material excavated from Kerma.\nKendall suggests that large tombs in the Upper Deffufa contained the bodies of dozens or hundreds of sacrificed victims. A later bioarchaeological examination of these remains , with samples drawn from the \"sacrificial corridors\" and interments outside of the large tumulus corridors, showed no significant differences between the skeletal-stress markers of sacrificed versus non-sacrificed individuals. Accompanying individuals in the tumuli at Kerma have been interpreted as wives sacrificed upon the death of the husband, but the bioarchaeological evidence does not support this conclusion. A prior study noted no difference in the frequency of traumatic injury.\nTraumatic injury in the Kerma remains is viewed through the lens of modern traumatic-injury patterns. \"Many aspects of the Kerma injury pattern were comparable to clinical [modern] observations: males experienced a higher frequency of trauma, the middle-aged group exhibited the most trauma, the oldest age cohort revealed the least amount of accumulated injuries, a small group experienced multiple trauma and fractures occurred more frequently than dislocations or muscle pulls.\" Parry fractures, which often occur when an individual is fending off a blow from an attacker, are common. These do not necessarily result from assault, however, and Judd does acknowledge this. She does not use the same parsing strategy when considering that Colles' fractures (of the wrist, which usually occur when an object falls onto one's hands) may have resulted from being pushed from a height (as distinct from other interpersonal violence), and this is not acknowledged.\nS.O.Y. Keita conducted an anthropological study in which he examined the crania of groups in the North African region, including samples from Kerma c. 2000 BC and the Maghreb c. 1500 BC, as well as First Dynasty crania from the royal tombs in Abydos, Egypt. The results determined that the predominant pattern of the First Dynasty Egyptian crania was a \"Southern\" or a \"tropical African variant\" (though other patterns were also observed), which had affinities with Kerma Kushites. The general results demonstrated greater affinity with Upper Nile Valley groups but also suggested a clear change from earlier craniometric trends. The gene flow and movement of northern officials to the important southern city may explain the findings.\n\nSee also\nDoukki Gel\nKerma culture\nAfrican empires\nNubian architecture\nJebel Barkal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nKerma website Official website of the Swiss archeological mission to Sudan (Mission archéologique suisse au Soudan)\nKerma Culture A museum gallery at the University of Chicago Oriental Institute",
          "summary": "Kerma was the capital city of the Kerma culture, which was founded in present-day Sudan before 3500 BC. Kerma is one of the largest archaeological sites in ancient Nubia. It has produced decades of extensive excavations and research, including thousands of graves and tombs and the residential quarters of the main city surrounding the Western, or Lower, Deffufa.\nThe locale that is now Kerma was first settled by hunter-gatherers around 8350 BC, during the Mesolithic. Between 5550 BC and 5150 BC, the site was mostly abandoned, possibly due to decreased Nile flow during this time interval. A second hiatus in occupation occurred between 4050 BC and 3450 BC, likely as a result of minimal flow from the White Nile. Around 3000 BC, agriculture developed and a cultural tradition began around Kerma. Kerma later developed into a large urban center that was built around a large adobe temple known as the Western Deffufa, which was built after 1750 BC. A state society formed between 2550 BC and 1550 BC, with a significant decrease in cattle breeding being evidenced by the archaeological record around 1750 BC. Evidence for copper metallurgy appears from c. 2200–2000 BC. As a capital city and location of royal burials, Kerma sheds light on the complex social structure present in this society.",

          "content": "Suakin or Sawakin (Arabic: سواكن, romanized: Sawākin, Beja: Oosook) is a port city in northeastern Sudan, on the west coast of the Red Sea. It was formerly the region's chief port, but is now secondary to Port Sudan, about 50 kilometres (30 mi) north.\nSuakin used to be considered the height of medieval luxury on the Red Sea, but the old city built of coral is now in ruins. In 1983, the adjacent historic mainland town, known as the Geyf, had a population of 18,030 and the 2009 population was estimated at 43,337. Ferries run daily from Suakin to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia.\n\nEtymology\nThe Beja name for Suakin is Oosook. This is possibly from the Arabic word suq, meaning market. In Beja, the locative case for this is isukib, whence Suakin might have derived. The spelling on Admiralty charts in the late 19th century was \"Sauakin\", but in the popular press \"Suakim\" was predominant.\n\nHistory\nAncient\nSuakin was likely Ptolemy's Port of Good Hope, Limen Evangelis, which is similarly described as lying on a circular island at the end of a long inlet. Under the Ptolemies and Romans, though, the Red Sea's major port was Berenice to the north. The growth of the Muslim caliphate shifted trade first to the Hijaz and then to the Persian Gulf.\n\nMedieval\nThe collapse of the Abbasids and growth of Fatimid Egypt changed this and Al-Qusayr and Aydhab became important emporia, trading with India and ferrying African pilgrims to Mecca. Suakin was first mentioned by name in the 10th century by al-Hamdani, who says it was already an ancient town. At that time, Suakin was a small Beja settlement, but it began to expand after the abandonment of the port of Badi to its south. The Crusades and Mongol invasions drove more trade into the region: there are a number of references to Venetian merchants residing at Suakin and Massawa as early as the 14th century.\n\nOne of Suakin's rulers, Ala al-Din al-Asba'ani, angered the Mamluk sultan Baybars by seizing the goods of merchants who died at sea nearby. In 1264, the governor of Qus and his general Ikhmin Ala al-Din attacked with the support of Aydhab. Al-Asba'ani was forced to flee the city. The continuing enmity between the two towns is testified to by reports that after the destruction of Aydhab by Sultan Barsbay in 1426, the refugees, who fled to Suakin instead of Dongola, were all slaughtered.\nDespite the town's formal submission to the Mamluks in 1317, O. G. S. Crawford believed that the city remained a center of Christianity into the 13th century. Muslim immigrants such as the Banu Kanz gradually transformed this: Ibn Battuta records that in 1332, there was a Muslim \"sultan\" of Suakin, al-Sharif Zaid ibn-Abi Numayy ibn-'Ajlan, who was the son of a Meccan sharif. Following the region's inheritance laws, he had inherited the local leadership from his Bejan maternal uncles. With the decline of Mamluk power in the late 14th century, the Hedareb tribe took over the port city and made it their capital. Suakin then established itself as the most important north east African port along the Red Sea. In the fifteenth century, Suakin was briefly part of the Adal Sultanate. Suakin was sieged by the Portuguese in 1513 and captured briefly in 1541.\n\nOttoman\nFollowing the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517, the Ottoman Empire became the major power in the Red Sea. After a brief period of Ottoman-Portuguese struggles in the Red Sea, Özdemir Pasha occupied Suakin in the early 1550s. Though it was only loosely controlled, until the Ottoman province of Habesh was established in 1555 with the residence of its pasha in Suakin. The Ottomans restored the two main mosques - Shafi'i and Hanafi, strengthened the walls of the fort and built new roads and buildings. As the Portuguese explorers discovered and perfected the sea route around Africa and the Ottomans were unable to stop this trade, the local merchants began to abandon the town.\nSome trade was kept up with the Sultanate of Sennar, but by the 18th and 19th centuries, the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt found two-thirds of the homes in ruins. The Khedive Isma'il received Suakin from the Ottomans in 1865 and attempted to revitalize it: Egypt built new houses, mills, mosques, hospitals, and a church for immigrant Copts.\n\nBritish rule\nThe British Army was involved at Suakin in 1883–1885 and Lord Kitchener was there in this period leading the Egyptian Army contingent. Suakin was his headquarters and his force survived a lengthy siege there.\nThe Australian colonial forces of Victoria offered their torpedo boat HMVS Childers and gunboats HMVS Victoria and HMVS Albert, which arrived in Suakin on 19 March 1884 on their delivery voyage from Britain, only to be released as fighting had moved inland. They departed on 23 March, arriving in Melbourne on 25 June 1884. An essentially civilian military force of 770 men from New South Wales, including some of the Naval Brigade, arrived in Suakin in March 1885 and served until mid-May.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Mahdist State, the British preferred to develop the new Port Sudan, rather than engage in the extensive rebuilding and expansion that would have been necessary to make Suakin comparable. By 1922, the last of the British had left.\n\n21st century\nSince 2000, Sudan's National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums has undertaken research and documented the history of Suakin, and in 2022, the online project Sudan Memory published historical photographs, architectural drawings and a 3D reconstruction of the town on its website.\nOn 17 January 2018, as part of a rapprochement with Sudan, Turkey was granted a 99-year lease over Suakin island. Turkey plans to restore the ruined Ottoman port city on the island.\nOn 12 June 2022, some 15,000 sheep drowned in the sinking of the Badr 1 in the port of Suakin.\n\nBuildings of Suakin\nThe buildings of Suakin were largely constructed of madrepore, or rock-coral, taken from the sea-bed. The vernacular style of construction under the Ottomans was akin to that of Jiddah in Arabia and Mitsiwa in Ethiopia. The houses, which had a white plaster finish, were up to four storeys in height and often built in blocks or terraces of three or more, separated by narrow streets. They had large casement windows (Arab. rushān) and doors of Java teak surmounted by carved stone door-hoods and denticulated parapets. From the 1860s an Egyptian style of architecture began to incorporate features from Egypt and Europe. As the buildings had no plaster covering, they decayed quickly and the town fell into ruin.\nA detailed description of the buildings of Suakin, including measured plans and detailed sketches, can be found in The Coral Buildings of Suakin: Islamic Architecture, Planning, Design and Domestic Arrangements in a Red Sea Port by Jean-Pierre Greenlaw, Kegan Paul International, 1995, ISBN 0-7103-0489-7.\n\nClimate\nSuakin has a very hot desert climate (Köppen BWh) with brutally hot and humid, though dry, summers and very warm winters. Rainfall is minimal except from October to December, when easterly winds can give occasional downpours: in November 1965 as much as 445 millimetres (17.5 in) fell, but in the whole year from July 1981 to June 1982 no more than 3 millimetres (0.1 in) was recorded.\n\nSee also\nPort Sudan\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nGreenlaw, Jean-Pierre (1995) The Coral Buildings of Suakin: Islamic Architecture, Planning, Design and Domestic Arrangements in a Red Sea Port.

The city acts as an important road hub, with the Nile boosting transportation even further.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Omdurman (Umm Durmān) literally translates as \"Mother of Durmān\", but who she was or might have been is unknown.\n\nHistory\nAfter the siege of Khartoum, followed by the building of the tomb of the Mahdi after his death from typhus, the city grew rapidly. However, in the Battle of Omdurman in 1898 (which actually took place in the nearby village of Kerreri), Lord Kitchener decisively defeated the Mahdist forces. The following year British forces defeated Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, the Khalifa, as the Battle of Umm Diwaykarat; ensuring British control over the Sudan.\nIn September 1898, the British army of twenty thousand well drilled men equipped with the latest arms, Maxim guns and Martini-Henry rifles under the command of General Horatio Herbert Kitchener invaded Sudan. In the battle of Omdurman, the British Army faced Sudanese defenders consisting of over 52,000 poorly armed desert tribesmen dervishes; in the space of five hours the battle was over. The Sudanese defenders suffered many casualties, with at least 10,000 killed. By contrast there were fewer than four hundred casualties on the British side with forty-eight British soldiers losing their lives. Then, General Kitchener proceeded to order the desecration of the Mahdi's tomb and in the words of Winston Churchill, \"carried off the Mahdi's head in a kerosene can as a trophy\".\nKitchener restored Khartoum as the capital and, from 1899 until 1956 Sudan was jointly governed by Great Britain and Egypt. Although most of the city was destroyed in the battle, the Mahdi's tomb was restored and refurbished.\nOn 10 May 2008, the Darfur rebel group of the Justice and Equality Movement moved into the city where they engaged in heavy fighting with Sudanese government forces. Their goal was to topple Omar Hassan al-Bashir's government.\nDuring the Sudanese civil war, the city was occupied by the Rapid Support Forces between April 2023 and May 2025.\n\nGeography\nNeighbourhoods\nOmbadda\n\nClimate\nOmdurman features a hot arid climate, with only the summer months seeing noticeable precipitation. The city averages a little over 155 millimetres (6.1 in) of precipitation per year. Based on annual mean temperatures, the city is one of the hottest major cities in the world. Temperatures routinely exceed 40 °C (104 °F) in mid-summer.\nIts average annual high temperature is 37.1 °C (99 °F), with six months of the year seeing an average monthly high temperature of at least 38 °C (100 °F). Furthermore, throughout the year, none of its monthly average high temperatures falls below 30 °C (86 °F).

          "content": "Khartoum, also spelled Khartum, is the capital city of Sudan as well as Khartoum State. With an estimated population of 7.1 million people, Greater Khartoum is the largest urban area in Sudan.\nKhartoum is located at the confluence of the White Nile – flowing north from Lake Victoria – and the Blue Nile, flowing west from Lake Tana in Ethiopia. Divided by these two parts of the Nile, the Khartoum metropolitan area is a tripartite metropolis consisting of Khartoum proper and linked by bridges to Khartoum North (الخرطوم بحري al-Kharṭūm Baḥrī) and Omdurman (أم درمان Umm Durmān) to the west. The place where the two Niles meet is known as al-Mogran or al-Muqran (المقرن; English: \"The Confluence\").\nKhartoum was founded in 1821 by Muhammad Ali Pasha, north of the ancient city of Soba. In 1882 the British Empire took control of the Egyptian government, leaving the administration of Sudan in the hands of the Egyptians. At the outbreak of the Mahdist War, the British attempted to evacuate Anglo-Egyptian garrisons from Sudan but the Siege of Khartoum in 1884 resulted in the capture of the city by Mahdist forces and a massacre of the defending Anglo-Egyptian garrison. In 1898 it was reoccupied by British forces and was the seat of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan's government until 1956.\nIn 1956, the city was designated as the capital of an independent Sudan. Three hostages were killed during the attack on the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum in 1973.\nIn 2008, the Justice and Equality Movement engaged in combat in the city with the Sudanese Armed Forces as part of the War in Darfur. The Khartoum massacre occurred in 2019 during the Sudanese Revolution. Between 2023 and 2025, the city saw extensive combat during the civil war involving the armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), affecting Khartoum International Airport and other critical sites. In 2025, the Sudanese armed forces recaptured Khartoum from the RSF, leaving widespread destruction.\nKhartoum is an economic and trade center in North Africa, with rail lines from Port Sudan and El-Obeid. It is served by Khartoum International Airport with the New Khartoum International Airport under construction. Several national and cultural institutions are in Khartoum and its metropolitan area, including the National Museum of Sudan, the Khalifa House Museum, the University of Khartoum, and the Sudan University of Science and Technology.\n\nEtymology\nThe origin of the word Khartoum is uncertain. Some Scholars posit that the name derives from the Dinka words khar-tuom (Dinka-Bor dialect) or khier-tuom (as is the pronunciation in various Dinka dialects), translating to \"place where rivers meet\". This is supported by historical accounts which place the Dinka homeland in central Sudan (around present-day Khartoum) as recently as the 13th-17th centuries A.D.\nOne folk etymology is that it is derived from Arabic khurṭūm (خرطوم 'trunk' or 'hose'), probably referring to the narrow strip of land extending between the Blue and White Niles. \nCaptain J.A. Grant, who reached Khartoum in 1863 with Captain Speke's expedition, thought the name was most probably from the Arabic qurṭum (قرطم 'safflower', i.e., Carthamus tinctorius), which was cultivated extensively in Egypt for its oil to be used as fuel. Some scholars speculate that the word derives from the Nubian word Agartum, meaning \"the abode of Atum\", Atum being the Nubian and Egyptian god of creation. Other Beja scholars suggest Khartoum is derived from the Beja word hartoom, \"meeting\". Sociologist Vincent J. Donovan notes that in the Nilotic Maa language of the Maasai people, khartoum means \"we have acquired\" and that the geographical location of Khartoum is where Maasai oral tradition claims that the ancestors of the Maasai first acquired cattle.\n\nHistory\n19th century\nIn 1821, Khartoum was established 24 km (15 mi) north of the ancient city of Soba, by Isma'il Kamil Pasha, the third son of Egypt's ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, who had just incorporated Sudan into his realm. Originally, Khartoum served as an outpost for the Egyptian Army. Egypt shifted the seat of the colonial government from Wad Madani to Khartoum in 1823, which became a permanent settlement and underwent rapid development in the next decades. With its elevation to capital status, Khartoum quickly grew into a regional center of trade, serving as a rest area on the caravan route from Ethiopia to Egypt, but also becoming a major focal point for the slave trade.\nA significant change took place in 1854, when most of the city was destroyed by heavy rains and floods. It was rebuilt with houses made out of mud and stones, replacing those made out of thatch and straw. Khartoum also became the seat of several European consulates and the Apostolic Vicariate of Central Africa. European pressure and influence forced Egypt to close the city's public slave market in 1854, although slaves continued to be sold and trafficked in large numbers, specifically from the Blue Nile region and the Nuba Mountains, as well as down the White Nile (the Dinka and Shilluk territories). According to the British explorer Samuel Baker, who visited Khartoum in 1862, slavery was the industry \"that kept Khartoum going as a bustling town\". \nOn 13 March 1884, troops loyal to the Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad began the siege of Khartoum against the Egyptian garrison led by the British General Charles George Gordon. Despite being fortified by trenches and a wall connecting the Blue and White Niles, the city was conquered by the Mahdists on 26 January 1885 and the entire garrison was annihilated. Many of the inhabitants were massacred or enslaved and the survivors were deported to the newly established Omdurman, while Khartoum was largely destroyed and abandoned. \nWith the reconquest of Sudan by Anglo-Egyptian forces in 1898, Khartoum was established as the capital of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Herbert Kitchener became Governor-General of the Sudan in September 1898, and began a programme of reconstruction, Khartoum was rebuilt according to a street plan in the shape of the Union Jack. Khartoum Bahri was established as a garrison comprising a dockyard and a railhead to Egypt, while Omdurman, remained the most populous part and largely kept its old shape. He ordered the mosques of Khartoum rebuilt and guaranteed freedom of religion to all citizens. He also prevented Christian missionaries from trying to proselytize the local Muslims.\n\n20th century\nThe city rapidly grew and developed under British administration. Under Reginald Wingate (1899–1916), the Governor-General's Palace in Khartoum was rebuilt using red bricks, with sandstone used for the corners. The buildings in Khartoum proper were modeled after Victorian architecture, with a distinct Middle Eastern influence as well as Mediterranean-style windows and balconies. The Gordon Memorial College (now the University of Khartoum) was opened in 1903, and a new railway to Port Sudan was completed in 1919. These developments prompted large migration from rural areas, resulting in an increase in the city's population. By 1930, Khartoum was estimated to have a population of over 50,000.\nKhartoum continued to grow after it was declared the capital of the newly independent Republic of Sudan in 1956. Within the following years, the Municipal Stadium, the Khartoum American School and the Bank of Sudan would be established. This large scale development would spurred rural to urban migration, by 1964 Khartoum's population had ballooned to 185,000. In the 1973 census Khartoum would have a population of 334,000 inhabitants.\nIn 1973, the city was the site of a hostage crisis in which members of Black September held 10 hostages at the Saudi Arabian embassy, five of them diplomats. The US ambassador, the US deputy ambassador, and the Belgian chargé d'affaires were murdered. The remaining hostages were released. A 1973 United States Department of State document, declassified in 2006, concluded: \"The Khartoum operation was planned and carried out with the full knowledge and personal approval of Yasser Arafat.\"\nIn 1977, the first oil pipeline between Khartoum and Port Sudan was completed. The Organization of African Unity summit of 18–22 July 1978 was held in Khartoum, during which Sudan was awarded the OAU presidency.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Khartoum was the destination of hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring nations such as Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda. Many Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees assimilated into society, while others settled in large slums on the city's outskirts. Since the mid-1980s, large numbers of refugees from South Sudan and Darfur – fleeing the violence of the Second Sudanese Civil War and Darfur conflict – have settled around Khartoum.\nIn 1991, Osama bin Laden purchased a house in the affluent al-Riyadh neighborhood of the city and another in Soba. He lived there until 1996, when he was banished from the country. Following the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, the United States accused bin Laden's al-Qaeda group and, on 20 August, launched cruise missile attacks on the al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum North. The factory's destruction created diplomatic tension between the U.S. and Sudan. The factory ruins are now a tourist attraction.\nIn November 1991, the government of President Omar al-Bashir sought to remove half the population from the city. The residents, deemed squatters, were mostly southern Sudanese whom the government feared could be potential rebel sympathizers. Around 425,000 people were placed in five \"Peace Camps\" in the desert an hour's drive from Khartoum. The camps were watched over by heavily armed security guards, many relief agencies were banned from assisting, and \"the nearest food was at a market four miles away, a vast journey in the desert heat\". Many residents were reduced to having only burlap sacks as housing. The intentional displacement was part of a large urban renewal plan backed by the housing minister, Sharaf Bannaga.\n\n21st century\nThe sudden death of SPLA head and vice-president of Sudan John Garang in late July 2005, was followed by three days of violent riots in the capital. Order was finally restored after southern Sudanese politicians and tribal leaders sent strong messages to the rioters. The death toll was at least 24, as youths from southern Sudan attacked northern Sudanese and clashed with security forces.\nThe African Union summit of 16–24 January 2006 was held in Khartoum; as was the Arab League summit of 28–29 March 2006, during which they elected Sudan the Arab League presidency.\nOn 10 May 2008, the Darfur rebel group Justice and Equality Movement attacked the city with the goal of toppling Omar al-Bashir's government. The Sudanese government held off the assault.\nOn 23 October 2012, an explosion at the Yarmouk munitions factory killed two people and injured another person. The Sudanese government claimed that the explosion was the result of an Israeli airstrike.\nOn 3 June 2019, Khartoum was the site of the Khartoum massacre, where over 100 dissidents were murdered (the government said 61 were killed), hundreds more injured and 70 women raped by Rapid Support Forces (RSF) soldiers in order to forcefully disperse the peaceful protests calling for a civilian government.\nOn 1 July 2020, activists demanded that al-Zibar Basha street in Khartoum be renamed. Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur was a slave trader and the al-Zibar Basha street leads to the military base where the 2019 Khartoum massacre took place.\nOn 26 October 2021, the city was locked down following a military coup that left at least 7 dead, triggering protests and calls for a general strike. Prime minister Abdalla Hamdok was arrested during the coup, and held along with other cabinet members in an unknown location.\nOn 15 April 2023, fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF broke out across Sudan, including in Khartoum. Fighting was reported at the presidential palace, the RSF's headquarters, Khartoum International Airport and Merowe Airport, which the RSF claimed to have captured. The Sudanese Armed Forces regained full control of Khartoum on 26 March 2025.\n\nGeography\nLocation\nKhartoum is located at the confluence of the Blue Nile and the White Nile. \nKhartoum is relatively flat, at elevation 385 m (1,263 ft), as the Nile flows northeast past Omdurman to Shendi, at elevation 364 m (1,194 ft) about 163 km (101 mi) away.\n\nClimate\nKhartoum features a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with a dry season occurring during winter, typical of the Saharo-Sahelian zone, which marks the progressive passage between the Sahara Desert's vast arid areas and the Sahel's vast semi-arid areas. The climate is extremely dry for most of the year, with about eight months when average rainfall is lower than 5 mm (0.20 in). The very long dry season is itself divided into a warm, very dry season between November and February, as well as a very hot, dry season between March and May. During this part of the year, hot, dry continental trade winds from deserts, such as the harmattan, sweep over the region; the weather is stable and very dry.\nThe very irregular, very brief, rainy season lasts about 1 month as the maximum rainfall is recorded in August, with about 48 mm (1.9 in). The rainy season is characterized by a seasonal reverse of wind regimes, when the Intertropical Convergence Zone goes northerly. Average annual rainfall is very low, with only 121.3 mm (4.78 in) of precipitation. Khartoum records on average six days with 10 mm (0.39 in) or more and 19 days with 1 mm (0.039 in) or more of rainfall. The highest temperatures occur during two periods in the year: the first at the late dry season, when average high temperatures consistently exceed 40 °C (104 °F) from April to June, and the second at the early dry season, when average high temperatures exceed 39 °C (102 °F) in September and October. Temperatures cool off somewhat during the night, with Khartoum's lowest average low temperature of the year, in January, just above 15 °C (59 °F). Khartoum is one of the hottest major cities on Earth, with annual mean temperatures hovering around 30 °C (86 °F). The city also has very warm winters. In no month does the average monthly high temperature fall below 30 °C (86 °F). This is something not seen in other major cities with hot desert climates, such as Riyadh, Baghdad and Phoenix.\n\nDemographics\nAlmost 250,000 Syrians lived in Khartoum as of 2019, representing 5% of the total population of the city. Most are young men who have fled war in Syria. Sudan was the only country in the world to accept travelers carrying a Syrian passport who lacked a visa.\n\nEconomy\nAfter the signing of the historic Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLA), the Government of Sudan began a massive development project. In 2007, the biggest projects in Khartoum were the Al-Mogran Development Project, two five-star hotels, a new airport, El Mek Nimr Bridge (finished in October 2007) and the Tuti Bridge that links Khartoum to Tuti Island.\nIn the 21st century, Khartoum developed based on Sudan's oil wealth (although the independence of South Sudan in 2011 affected the economy of Sudan negatively). The center of the city has tree-lined streets. Khartoum has the highest concentration of economic activity in the country. This has changed as major economic developments take place in other parts of the country, like oil exploration in the south, the Giad Industrial Complex in Al Jazirah state and White Nile Sugar Project in Central Sudan, and the Merowe Dam in the North.\nAmong the city's industries are printing, glass manufacturing, food processing, and textiles. Petroleum products are now produced in the far north of Khartoum state, providing fuel and jobs for the city. One of Sudan's largest refineries is located in northern Khartoum.\n\nRetailing\nThe Souq al Arabi is Khartoum's largest open air market. The souq is spread over several blocks in the center of Khartoum proper just south of the Great Mosque (Mesjid al-Kabir) and the minibus station. It is divided into separate sections, including one focused entirely on gold.\nAl Qasr Street and Al Jamhoriyah Street are considered the most famous high streets in Khartoum State.\nAfra Mall is located in the southern suburb of Arkeweet. The Afra Mall has a supermarket, retail outlets, coffee shops, a bowling alley, movie theaters, and a children's playground.\nIn 2011, Sudan opened the Hotel Section and part of the food court of the new, Corinthia Hotel Tower. The Mall/Shopping section is still under construction.\n\nEducation\nKhartoum is the main location for most of Sudan's top educational bodies. There are four main levels of education:\n\nKindergarten and day-care. It begins in the age of 3–4, consisting of 1-2 grades, (depending on the parents).\nElementary school. The first grade pupils enter at the age of 6–7. It consists of 8 grades, after which, at 13–14 years old, students are ready to take the certificate exams and enter high school.\nUpper second school and high school. In these three the school methods add some main academic subjects such as chemistry, biology, physics, and geography. There are three grades in this level. The students' ages are about 14–15 to 17–18.\nHigher education. There are several universities and colleges in Khartoum, including the University of Khartoum and Sudan University of Science and Technology.\n\nTransportation\nKhartoum is home to the largest airport in Sudan, Khartoum International Airport. It is the main hub for Sudan Airways, Sudan's main carrier. A new airport was planned for the southern outskirts of the city, but with Khartoum's rapid growth and consequent urban sprawl, the airport is still located in the heart of the city.\nKhartoum's transportation is limited to the vehicular road system, with buses and personal vehicles comprising the main types of vehicles. As with many cities in the continent, parts of Khartoum are connected through privately owned buses.\n\nKhartoum has a number of bridges across both tributaries of the Nile. The Mac Nimir Bridge, the Blue Nile Road & Railway Bridge, the Cooper Bridge (also known as the Armed Forces Bridge), and the Elmansheya Bridge span the Blue Nile, connecting Khartoum to Khartoum North. The Omdurman Bridge, the Victory Bridge, and the Al-Dabbasin Bridge span the White Nile, connecting Khartoum to Omdurman. The Tuti Bridge connects Tuti Island with Khartoum. Prior to the construction of the Tuti Bridge in 2008, residents of Tuti Island relied on water taxis to cross the Blue Nile into Khartoum.\nKhartoum has rail lines from Wadi Halfa, Port Sudan on the Red Sea, and El Obeid. All are operated by Sudan Railways.\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of Khartoum reflects the city's history since the early 1820s and is marked by both native Sudanese, Turkish, British and modern buildings. In general, the architecture of Sudan reflects a wide diversity in its shapes, materials, and use.\nSince independence, the people of Sudan have introduced new infrastructure and technology, which has led to new and innovative building concepts, ideas and construction techniques.\n\nCulture\nMuseums\nThe largest museum in Sudan is the National Museum of Sudan. Founded in 1971, it contains works from different epochs of Sudanese history. Among the exhibits are two Egyptian temples of Buhen and Semna, originally built by Pharaoh Hatshepsut and Pharaoh Tuthmosis III, respectively, but relocated to Khartoum upon the flooding of Lake Nasser.\nThe Republican Palace Museum, opened in 2000, is located in the former Anglican All Saints' cathedral on Sharia al-Jama'a, next to the historical Presidential Palace.\nThe Ethnographic Museum is located on Sharia al-Jama'a, close to the Mac Nimir Bridge.\n\nBotanical gardens\nKhartoum is home to one of the oldest botanical gardens in Africa, National Botanical Garden in the Mogran district of the city.\n\nClubs\nKhartoum is home to several clubs, including the Blue Nile Sailing Club, social clubs such as the German Club, the Greek Club, the Coptic Club, the Syrian Club and the International Club, as well as football clubs Al Khartoum SC and Al Ahli Khartoum.\n\nPlaces of worship\nThe places of worship in Khartoum primarily consist of Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples: Coptic Orthodox Church, St. Matthew's Cathedral, Khartoum, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Khartoum (Catholic Church), Sudan Interior Church (Baptist World Alliance), the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation and Presbyterian Church in Sudan (World Communion of Reformed Churches).\n\nIn popular culture\nLiterature\nKhartoum's unique history and cultural significance have inspired literary works that explore its past, present, and future. For example, in \"Reading Khartoum\", the city is depicted as a space shaped by movement, political instability, and socio-cultural changes, resulting in underlying layers of meanings and ambiguity. Arabic-written poetry also offers a personalized glimpse of the city, reflecting its distinct cultural appearance and setting it apart from other Arab and African cities.\n\nMovies\nSong of Khartoum (1955)\nKhartoum (1966 film) (1966)\nKhartoum Offside (2019)\n\nNotable people\nSara Berkai, Eritrean and British social enterprise founder and STEM educator, born in Khartoum\n\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nKidnapped, tortured and thrown in jail: my 70 days in Sudan The Guardian, 2017\nWerner, Louis (April 2018). \"Khartoum: A Tale of Two Rivers\".

          "summary": "Khartoum, also spelled Khartum, is the capital city of Sudan as well as Khartoum State. With an estimated population of 7.1 million people, Greater Khartoum is the largest urban area in Sudan.\nKhartoum is located at the confluence of the White Nile – flowing north from Lake Victoria – and the Blue Nile, flowing west from Lake Tana in Ethiopia. Divided by these two parts of the Nile, the Khartoum metropolitan area is a tripartite metropolis consisting of Khartoum proper and linked by bridges to Khartoum North (الخرطوم بحري al-Kharṭūm Baḥrī) and Omdurman (أم درمان Umm Durmān) to the west. The place where the two Niles meet is known as al-Mogran or al-Muqran (المقرن; English: \"The Confluence\").\nKhartoum was founded in 1821 by Muhammad Ali Pasha, north of the ancient city of Soba. In 1882 the British Empire took control of the Egyptian government, leaving the administration of Sudan in the hands of the Egyptians. At the outbreak of the Mahdist War, the British attempted to evacuate Anglo-Egyptian garrisons from Sudan but the Siege of Khartoum in 1884 resulted in the capture of the city by Mahdist forces and a massacre of the defending Anglo-Egyptian garrison. In 1898 it was reoccupied by British forces and was the seat of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan's government until 1956.\nIn 1956, the city was designated as the capital of an independent Sudan. Three hostages were killed during the attack on the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum in 1973.\nIn 2008, the Justice and Equality Movement engaged in combat in the city with the Sudanese Armed Forces as part of the War in Darfur. The Khartoum massacre occurred in 2019 during the Sudanese Revolution. Between 2023 and 2025, the city saw extensive combat during the civil war involving the armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), affecting Khartoum International Airport and other critical sites. In 2025, the Sudanese armed forces recaptured Khartoum from the RSF, leaving widespread destruction.\nKhartoum is an economic and trade center in North Africa, with rail lines from Port Sudan and El-Obeid. It is served by Khartoum International Airport with the New Khartoum International Airport under construction. Several national and cultural institutions are in Khartoum and its metropolitan area, including the National Museum of Sudan, the Khalifa House Museum, the University of Khartoum, and the Sudan University of Science and Technology.",

فيها مقر رئيس الجمهوريه والحكومه، ورئاسه الوزارات المركزيه المختلفه وقياده القوات المسلحه السودانيه والبعثات الدبلوماسيه الاجنبيه من سفارات وقنصليات، ومقر بعض المنظمات الاقليميه العربيه والافريقيه ومعظم المؤسسات السياسيه للدوله. وهي قلب افريقيا بالنسبه لخطوط الطيران، وذلك لمرور خطوط الطيران التي تقطع شمال القاره تجاه جنوبها وتلك التي تمر عبر غرب القاره وشرقها. يوجد بالمدينه العديد من الجامعات والكليات الحكوميه والخاصه والمؤسسات التعليميه المختلفه ورئاسات الشركات والبنوك الوطنيه وفروع الشركات الاجنبيه.\nيرجع تاريخ تاسيس الخرطوم كعاصمه، الى العقود الاولى من القرن التاسع عشر اثناء فتره الحكم العثماني المصري في السودان حيثُ اتخذت عاصمه للبلاد، الا ان تاريخها كموقع استيطان بشري ابعد من ذلك بكثير فقد سكنها الانسان منذ العصر الحجري، كما كان موقعها موطن حضاره قديمه عُرفت بمملكه علوه وشهد القَرن الماضي اول مرحله من مراحل ازدهارها عندما شُيّدت العماره في العهد البريطاني المصري على النسق المعماري الانجليزي والذي لا يزال ماثلاً للعيان في الابنيه القديمه بجامعه الخرطوم ومبنى وزاره الماليه ومصلحه البريد والبرق وبعض المرافق الحكوميه المطله على النيل وتحول بعضها الى متاحف مفتوحه للجمهور، وفي بعض الجسور القديمه المقامه على نهر النيل والتي تربطها بما يحيط بها من مناطق حضريه. يبلغ عدد سكان مدينه الخرطوم 2,682,431 نسمه، وهي بذلك سادس مدينه من حيث عدد السكان في افريقيا (ولا يشمل الرقم باقي سكان العاصمه المثلثه البالغ عددهم 5,172,000 تقريباً) ويمثل سكانها مختلف الاثنيات والمجموعات السكانيه من داخل السودان وخارجه بالاضافه الى اعداد كبيره من اللاجئين وغيرهم من الوافدين السياسيين، والمناخ في الخرطوم معتدل في فصل الشتاء مع ارتفاع في درجات الحراره في الصيف وهطول امطار غزيره في موسم الخريف، وتتميز المدينه بموقعها الاستراتيجي في وسط السودان حيث التقاء النيل الازرق بالنيل الابيض، الذي جعل منها منطقه جذب سياحي تزخر بالمعالم الطبيعيه والاثريه، ومحور نقل واتصالات محليّه واقليميه.\n\nالخرطوم الكبرى\nيتعين التمييز بين الخرطوم العاصمه القوميه او  العاصمه المثلثه كما يطلق عليها احياناً، والخرطوم الولايه، وبينهما وبين الخرطوم المدينه، او الخرطوم عموم كما تسمى. ويقصد بالعاصمه المثلثه التجمع الميتروبوليتي المتكوّن من المدن الثلاث التي تنتشر فيها المصالح والدواوين الحكوميه وترتبط مع بعضها البعض جغرافياً وادارياً واجتماعياً، وهي الخرطوم عموم الواقعه على الضفه الجنوبيه والغربيه للنيل الازرق والضفه الشرقيه للنيل الابيض، والمدينه الثانيه هي ام درمان وتقع على الضفه الغربيه للنيل الابيض ونهر النيل اي المجرى الذي يتكون من النيلين الازرق والابيض بعد التقائهما عند نقطه المقرن. والمدينه الثالثه هي الخرطوم بحري (اي الخرطوم شمال، كما تسمى باللغه الانجليزيه. لفظ بحري باللهجه المصريه يرادف لفظ شمال بالفصحى) وتقع على الضفه الشماليه للنيل الازرق والضفه الشرقيه لنهر النيل. واما الخرطوم الولايه، اي ولايه الخرطوم فهذه تشمل المدن الثلاث وضواحيها وبعض المناطق المحيطه بها وهي احدى ولايات السودان.\n\nاصل التسميه\nاختلفت الروايات حول سبب تسميه المدينه بهذا الاسم وحول اصل التسميه ومعنى اللفظ. فهناك من يقول بان التسميه ترجع الى شكل قطعه الارض التي تقع عليها المدينه والتي يشقها نهري النيل ويلتقيان فيها مع بعضهما في شكل انحنائي يرسمان بينهما قطعه ارض اشبه بخرطوم الفيل وهو الراي الراجح،\nالا ان الرحاله البريطاني كابتن جيمس جرانت الذي رافق الكابتن جون اسبيك في رحلته الاستكشافيه لمنابع النيل ذكر بان الاسم مشتق من زهره القرطم التي كانت تزرع بكثافه في المنطقه لتصديرها الى مصر لاستخراج الزيت منها للاناره وقد استخدمها الرومان عند غزوهم لمصر ووصولهم الى شمال السودان حيث عثروا على زهره القرطم في موقع الخرطوم الحالي واستخدموا الزيت المستخرج من حبوبها في علاج جروح جنودهم. وهناك ايضاً تفسيرات اخرى للاسم لا سند لها مثل «خور التوم» نسبه الى شخص يدعى التوم.\nوالخرطوم في اللغه هو الانف من الانسان، حيث قال تعالى: (اِذَا تُتْلَى عَلَيْهِ ءاياتُنَا قَالَ اَسَاطِيرُ الاَوَّلِينَ سَنَسِمُهُ عَلَى الْخُرْطُومِ)،(قران كريم، سوره القلم، ايه 15، 16) اي سوف نجعل له الوسم بالسواد على انفه، وقيل على وجهه فيكون له وسمه. وقال قتاده سنسمه على الخرطوم بمعنى ان نضع سيما على انفه. والمعنى من الايات هو الوليد بن المغيره.\nوالخرطوم هو ايضاً اسم لانف السبع او الفيل وهو ما يتماشى لغوياُ مع معنى تسميه الخرطوم.\n\nالتاريخ\nاُسست الخرطوم كمدينه على يد الجيش العثماني في عهد محمد علي باشا عندما ارسل جيشه لضم السودان الى مُلكه بقياده ابنه الثالث اسماعيل كامل باشا عام 1821م، واتخذها الاتراك في البدايه معسكراً لجيوشهم ثم تحولت الى عاصمه لهم في عهد عثمان جركس باشا البرنجي عام 1824م وذلك بعد تعيينه حكمدارا (حاكماً) على السودان خلفا للحكمدار محمد بك خسرو الدفتردار.\n\nالتاريخ القديم\nيعود تاريخ الخرطوم كمستوطنه بشريه الى عصور سحيقه حيث اكدت المستحثات على ان الانسان قد استوطن في موقع الخرطوم الحالي منذ سنه 400 قبل الميلاد، وتم العثور على ادوات تعود الى العصر الحجري في منطقه خور ابو عنجه في مدينه ام درمان الحاليه القريبه من الخرطوم، اضافه الى بقايا اثريه لمستوطنات يرجع تاريخها الى عهد مملكتي نبته ومروي في الفتره من 750 قبل الميلاد الى 350 بعد الميلاد.\nوتقول مصادر اخرى ترجع في تاريخها الى القرن السادس عشر الميلادي بان المكان الذي تقوم عليه الان الخرطوم كان عباره عن احراش وغابات، وكان يبعد عن مدينه سوبا عاصمه مملكه علوه، احدى الممالك المسيحيه القديمه في السودان، حوالي 24 كيلومتر (15 ميل). وفي القرن السادس عشر قام سكان جزيره توتي التي تقع في مجري نهر النيل المقابل للمكان - وكانوا ينتمون الى قبيله (المحس) النوبيه - بزراعه المكان، قبل ان يقيم فيه احد فقهائهم ويدعى الشيخ ارباب العقائد مدرسه لتعليم القران ويتحول تدريجياً الى منطقه سكنيه.\n\nالممالك المسيحيه\nورد ذكر سوبا باعتبارها عاصمه لمملكه علوه وهي الان المنطقه الجنوبيه للخرطوم في كتب عدد من الرحاله العرب والمسلمين، فقد ذكرها اليعقوبي بقوله «والمملكه الثانيه من النوبه الذين يقال لهم علوه وفي سنه 360 هجريه (970، ميلاديه) زار منطقه الخرطوم احمد بن حوقل، ودون في كتابه صوره الارض انه تجول في منطقه سوبا وذكر بان بها جماعه من المسلمين، كما وصف منطقه النيل الابيض وقال: «من وراء النيل نهر عظيم يسمى بحر ابيض سكانه جنس من النوبه» وصف ابن حوقل سوبا بانها «اوسع من الحبشه وعمارتها اكثر مما بالحبشه، ويخترق نيل مصر فيما بين مدنهم ونواحيهم. وقراهم عامره خصبه كثيره التمر والزرع والخضر. ومن اعمر بلادهم نواحي علوه وهي ناحيه لها قرى متصله وعمارات مشتبكه حتى ان السائر ليجتاز في الرحله الواحده بقرى عده غير متقطعه الحدود، ذوات مياه متصله بسواق من النيل»، كذلك كتب عنها ابن سليم الاسواني في القرن العاشر الميلادي وقال ان «المسافه ما بين دنقله الى اول بلد علوه، اكثر مما بينها واسوان. وفي ذلك من القرى والضياع والجزائر والمواشي والنخل والشجر والمقل الزرع والكرم، اضعاف ما في الجانب الذي يلي ارض الاسلام.. ومتملك علوه اكثر مالاً من متملك المقره واعظم جيشاً، وعنده من الخيل ما ليس عند المقرى، وبلده اخصب واوسع»، اما ابو صالح الارمني فقد ذكر عن سوبا بان «بها جيش ومملكه عظيمه جداً واعمال متسعه، وبها اربعمائه كنيسه. وهذه المدينه في شرقي الجزيره الكبيره بين البحرين الابيض والاخضر، وجميع من بها نصارى يعاقبه، حولها ديارات متباعده من البحر، ومنها ما هو على البحر، وبها كنيسه عظيمه جداً متسعه محكمه الوضع والبناء» هذه الكتابات تدل على ان منطقه الخرطوم كانت منطقه حضاره مزدهره ابان العصر المسيحي في السودان، وقبل تخريبها من قبل جحافل الفونج حتى اصبح «خراب سوبا» مضرب امثال شعبيه في السودان.\nولا يعرف الكثير عن الخرطوم في عصر الفونج الذين اسسوا مُلكهم في السودان بتحالف مع قبائل العبدلاب واقاموا عاصمتهم في سنار، سوى استمرار مدارسها وخلاويها القرانيه في تدريس علوم الدين وابرزها مدرسه اسلانج القرانيه بجزيره اسلانج الواقعه في شمال مدينه الخرطوم وقد تاسس بها اول مسجد هو مسجد حمد النجيض الجموعي في عهد عجيب المانجلك واشتهرت بتعليم القران وتوافد اتباع الطريقه القادريه احدى الطرق الصوفيه الرئيسيه في السودان.\n\nالعهد العثماني (1821- 1885)\nيبدا التاريخ الحديث لمدينه الخرطوم مع مجيء الجيش العثماني لاياله مصر الى السودان بقياده اسماعيل كامل باشا ابن محمد علي باشا خديوي مصر، والذي حط رحاله عليها وهو في طريقه الى سنار عاصمه السلطنه الزرقاء التي كانت تحكم تلك المناطق في عام 1821م، واقام فيها معسكراً لجنوده على بعد ميل واحد (1,6 كيلومتر) من ضفه النهر وفي منطقه السكه الحديديه الحاليه، ولكنه اختار اولاً مدينه ود مدني الواقعه بين سنار والخرطوم عاصمه جديده للبلاد. ولم يطب المقام للاتراك في مدينه ود مدني بسبب مناخها الجاف، ولذلك عندما جاء الاميرالاي عثمان جركس باشا البرنجي، الذي عُيّن حاكماً على السودان (1823 - 1825) م ومر على ملتقى النيلين (الازرق والابيض) وهو في طريقه الى العاصمه ود مدني اُعجِب بالمكان وبقي في معسكر الخرطوم ثم امر ببناء الثكنات والقلاع فيه. فقرر ابراهيم باشا، ابن محمد علي باشا خديوي مصر، الانتقال الى الخرطوم القديمه واتخاذها عاصمه للسودان.\nبدا الاتراك في بناء المدينه على طراز معماري جديد فشيدت المباني من الطوب الاجر واُقيمت مباني الادارات. وشهدت المدينه توسعاً في عهد خورشيد باشا حكمدار السودان في سنه 1826 م، وفي عام 1850 امر الخديوي عباس بانشاء مدرسه الخرطوم بينما قام الحكمدار عبد اللطيف 1849 - 1851 م بتاسيس حي «الحكمداريه» ليكون مجمعاً لمباني الاداره العثمانيه ومساكن للقاده. وفي عهد الحكمدار اسماعيل ايوب 1873 - 1877 م وُضِعت لبنات الصناعه في الخرطوم عندما تم تشييد معمل لصناعه الورق واخر للبارود. وفي فتره الجنرال غوردون باشا حاكم عام السودان الانجليزي المصري تم بناء «بوابه المسلميه» وكانت تقع في مكان كوبري (جسر) المسلميه الحالي، جنوب مستشفى الخرطوم، فوق خط السكه الحديديه، و«بوابه الكلاكله» وكان موقعها مكان كوبري الحريه الحالي، الذي تم تشييده ابّان عهد الرئيس ابراهيم عبود في مطلع ستينات القرن الماضي.\nوورد في كتاب تاريخ الخرطوم للمؤرخ السوداني محمد ابراهيم ابو سليم بان اهم احياء الخرطوم في العهد العثماني شملت حي الحكمداريه، حيث مركز الحكم، وحي المسجد، والاحياء الشعبيه في اطراف المدينه التي كان يسكنها عامه الناس، ومنها حي سلامه الباشا، وحي هبوب ضرباني، وحي الكاره، وحي الترس، الذي اخذ اسمه من الحواجز الترابيه التي اقيمت جنوبه لحمايه المدينه من فيضان نهر النيل الابيض، وحي بري المحس (وهو الحي الوحيد الذي لا يزال محافظاً على اسمه ولكنه تم تغيير مكانه الى موقع اخر ليفسح المجال لبناء ثكنات الجيش البريطاني في فتره لاحقه (1900) والتي تحولت بعد الاستقلال (1956) الى مباني داخليات لطلاب جامعه الخرطوم.\n\nعهد الدوله المهديه (1885- 1898)\nعاشت الخرطوم فتره تاريخيه عصيبه منذ بدايه الثوره المهديه باعتبارها مقر حكم الغزاه. وكان من المتوقع ان تزحف اليها قوات المهدي المناوئه للحكم العثماني في السودان ووكيله خديوي مصر، في اي وقت بعد ان حققت انتصارات باهره على القوات العثمانيه في مختلف مدن السودان، اخرها كان الانتصار الكبير على الجنرال الانجليزي وليام هكس باشا في سنه 1883 م في واقعه شيكان القريبه من مدينه الابيض على بعد 588 كيلومتر (365 ميل)، حيث طلب المهدي من احد انصاره في منطقه الخرطوم وهو الشيخ محمد الطيب البصير بمحاصره المدينه، وارسل اليه قوات مسانده بقياده الامير محمد عثمان ابو قرجه، وبوصول مدد اخر من القوات يقوده الامير عبد الرحمن النجومي، تمكن الانصار من احكام حصارهم للخرطوم، وضاقت الحلقه حولها بوصول المهدي نفسه والذي عسكر بجيشه في منطقه ابو سعد بام درمان سنه 1884 م، قبل ان يدخلها منتصراً في 26 يناير / كانون الثاني 1885 م. وتقول المصادر البريطانيه، بان الخرطوم تعرضت لدمار كبير من قبل قوات الدراويش الفاتحه والتي تمكنت من دك حصون الاتراك ووقع غوردون باشا صريعاً في قصره المطل على النيل الازرق، الا ان مصادر المهديه تؤكد بان خليفه المهدي عبد الله التعايشي امر بعدم تخريب الخرطوم وعدم نقل مواد البناء منها الى ام درمان، وان المهدي قد غضب شديداً عندما علم بمقتل غوردون على يد قواته لانه كان يريد القبض عليه حيّاً واسره.\nاقام كبار انصار المهدي من امراء وقاده في قصور الدوله وبيوت الاعيان في حي المسجد بينما اقام المهدي في قصر يسمى «قصر الجاركوك» وكان قريباً من المسجد، وسكن الخليفه عبد الله التعايشي في سراي الحكمدار، اما اهالي الخرطوم فقد تم جمعهم في الطرف الجنوبي من المدينه، ولم تستمر اقامه قاده المهديه طويلاً في الخرطوم حيث انتقلوا الى ام درمان التي اتخذوها مقراً جديدا للحكم في السودان في مايو / ايار من عام 1885 م.\n\nالحكم الثنائي (1898- 1956)\nفقدت الخرطوم مركزها كعاصمه للبلاد في عهد المهديه بعد ان اختار المهدي مدينه ام درمان الواقعه على الضفه الاخرى من نهر النيل عاصمه للدوله، فاقيمت بها منشات ودوواين الحكم من بيت مال وثكنات للجيش وسور لحمايتها وغير ذلك. وفي تلك الفتره عانت الخرطوم من الاهمال الحكومي، وانتقلت التجاره والصناعه التقليديه الى العاصمه الجديده، الا ان هزيمه الدروايش في معركه كرري في ديسمبر / كانون الاول عام 1898م، وخروج الخليفه عبد الله التعايشي من ام درمان اعاد الروح مجدداً الى الخرطوم حيث قامت القوات البريطانيه المصريه بقياده اللورد كيتشنر باعاده بناء المدينه باعتبارها العاصمه الرسميه للحكم الثنائي عام 1899 م، وقُدِمت عده تصاميم هندسيه لبناء الخرطوم الجديده «الانجلو-مصريه».\nوشهدت الخرطوم فتره استقرار سياسي واجتماعي حتى وقعت حادثه اغتيال السير سير لي استاك حاكم عام السودان في القاهره حيث قررت انجلترا طرد الجيش المصري من السودان في ظرف اربعه وعشرين ساعه واجلاء الموظفين المدنيين المصريين وذلك كرد فعل انتقامي على حادثه الاغتيال لتنفرد انجلترا بحكم السودان مما اثار رد فعل عنيف وسط السودانيين الذين خرجوا في مظاهرات بقياده جمعيه اللواء الابيض التي كان يراسها الضابط السوداني علي عبد اللطيف والذي القي عليه القبض وادُخل السجن، وادى ذلك بدوره الى تاجيج حاله الاستياء وسط سكان الخرطوم. وفي 27 نوفمبر / تشرين الثاني 1924 م تمردت وحده عسكريه تابعه لقوه دفاع السودان الخاضعه للحكومه الاستعماريه. وكان يقود الوحده الضابط السوداني عبد الفضيل الماظ. تحركت الوحده من الخرطوم في اتجاه مدينه الخرطوم بحري الواقعه على الضفه الشماليه لنهر النيل الازرق واعترضتها قوه انجليزيه في موقع قريب من جسر النيل الازرق الذي يربط بين المدينتين واندلعت معركه سقط فيها العشرات من الجانبين واحدثت موجه من الهلع وسط السكان الذين فرت اعداد منهم الى الاحراش المحيطه بالمدينه وتمكنت القوه الانجليزيه من القضاء على تمرد الجنود والضباط السودانيين وذلك بمحاصره الضابط عبد الفضيل الماظ في مستشفى الخرطوم وقصفه بالمدافع الثقيله. وعرفت تلك الاحداث في السودان بثوره 1924.\nوفي اثناء الحرب العالميه الثانيه ابّان حمله شرق افريقيا، دخلت الخرطوم في اتون الصراع بين مجموعه دول الحلفاء في الحرب العالميه الثانيه ومجموعه ما يسمى بدول المحور ممثله بايطاليا التي كانت تحتل الحبشه واريتريا والصومال الايطالي. وفي 23 اغسطس / اب 1940 م، اغارت طائره حربيه ايطاليه على الخرطوم تلتها غاره جويه اخرى في اليوم التالي على ام درمان ادت الى مصرع 3 اشخاص وفي 10 سبتمبر / ايلول من العام ذاته القت طائره حربيه ايطاليه بقنابلها على مشارف الخرطوم.\nبانتصار الحلفاء طلب السودانيون من انجلترا الوفاء بوعدها لهم بمنح السودان حق تقرير المصير وبدات حكومتا الحكم الثنائي في مناقشه هذه المطالب مع الاحزاب السودانيه وبعد استيلاء الضباط الاحرار على السلطه في مصر واختيار اللواء محمد نجيب رئيساً مجلس قياده الثوره المصريه، جاء محمد نجيب الى الخرطوم - وهو من مواليدها - لافتتاح البرلمان السوداني الجديد الذي سيتولى مهمه الاقتراع على استقلال السودان او وحدته مع مصر. وشهدت الخرطوم ابّان زيارته احداثاً داميه في مطار الخرطوم الدولي عندما اصطدمت اعداد كبيره من المؤيدين للاستقلال التام للسودان وسقط عدد من القتلى والجرحى وعُرفت تلك الحوادث بحوادث مارس 1954.\nوفي يوم الاحد اول يناير / كانون الثاني شهدت الخرطوم احتفالات حاشده حيث تم رفع علم الاستقلال على ساريه سرايا الحاكم العام التي تغيّر اسمها الى القصر الجمهوري.\n\nالتاريخ المعاصر\nفي الفتره التي تلت استقلال السودان في عام 1956م شهدت الخرطوم عده احداث وفعاليات سياسيه وطنيه واقليميه ودوليه، فالى جانب قيامها بدور العاصمه السياسيه للسودان ومقراً للحكم فقد استضافت عدداً من المنظمات الاقليميه التي تم ابرام اتفاقيات انشائها في السودان واصبحت مدينه الخرطوم مقراً لها. ففي فبراير / شباط 1957، تم تاسيس الاتحاد الافريقي لكره القدم في الخرطوم التي كانت اول مقر له قبل انتقال المقر الى القاهره وفي الخرطوم تم تنظيم اول بطوله لكاس الامم الافريقيه. وفي فبراير / شباط 1969، تم انشاء اتحاد اذاعات الدول العربيه في الخرطوم وانعقدت في التاريخ نفسه اول جلسه لجمعيته العامه في الخرطوم. وفي 11 مارس / اذار 1970 تم انشاء المنظمه العربيه للتنميه الزراعيه لتكون المدينه مقراً لها. وفي الشهر ذاته من عام 1975 بدا المصرف العربي للتنميه الاقتصاديه في افريقيا اعماله انطلاقاً منها وفي ابريل / نيسان تم في الخرطوم الاعلان عن انشاء منظمه الاحزاب السياسيه الافريقيه.\nوفي نوفمبر / تشرين الاول 1976 م، تاسست في الخرطوم الهيئه العربيه للاستثمار والانماء الزراعي.\nكما شهدت الخرطوم انعقاد عده مؤتمرات قمه عربيه وافريقيه مهمه حيث انعقد فيها في عام 1967 م، مؤتمر القمه العربي الرابع المعروف باسم قمه اللاءات الثلاثه، وفي عام 2006 م، مؤتمر القمه العربيه الثامنه عشره كما انعقد فيها مؤتمران للقمه الافريقيه احدهما في عام 1978 والاخر في عام 2006 الى جانب انعقاد مؤتمرات اخرى على مستوى وزاري مثل مؤتمر وزراء دفاع وقاده دول شرق افريقيا في عام 2012 م.\nفي عام 1973، كانت المدينه مسرحاً لازمه رهائن عندما قامت مجموعه تابعه لمنظمه ايلول الاسود الفلسطينيه باقتحام حفل استقبال كان يقيمه عميد السلك الدبلوماسي بالخرطوم سفير المملكه العربيه السعوديه لوداع مستشار بالسفاره الامريكيه واحتجاز عدد من المدعوين وتقدمت بمطالب لم تتم الاستجابه لها، ومن بينها اطلاق سراح احد رفاقها من السجون الاردنيه فقامت باغتيال السفير الامريكي الجديد انذاك ومستشار السفاره المحتفى به، والقائم بالاعمال البلجيكي، وافرجت عن الرهائن الاخرين بمن فيهم السفير السعودي والسفير الاردني ثم استسلمت للسلطات السودانيه التي قامت باعتقال افرادها وسلمتهم لاحقاُ لمنظمه التحرير الفلسطينيه.\nوفي سبعينيات وثمانينيات القرن الماضي استقبلت الخرطوم موجات متعاقبه من اللاجئين والنازحين والمهجرين، الوافدين من مناطق النزاعات المسلحه والجفاف في البلدان المجاوره مثل تشاد واريتريا واثيوبيا واوغندا افلح بعضهم في الاندماج في مجتمعها، في حين اقام البعض الاخر في احياء بضواحي المدينه. وفي منتصف الثمانينيات استقرت حول الخرطوم اعداد كبيره من السودانيين النازحين من مناطق الصراع في جنوب السودان ودار فور\nوفي يوم 14 اغسطس / اب 1994 م، تم في الخرطوم اعتقال الفنزويلي كارلوس الملقب بابن اوى والمطلوب من قبل السلطات الامنيه في عدد من الدول الغربيه وتم نقله من الخرطوم الى باريس.\nاقام اسامه بن لادن في حي الرياض بالخرطوم في الفتره من عام 1991 وحتى 1996 م، قبل ان يتم ابعاده منها. وفي اعقاب تفجيرات السفاره الامريكيه في كل من كمبالا ودار السلام في عام 1998 م، اتهمت الولايات المتحده تنظيم القاعده الذي كان يتزعمه بمسؤوليه التفجيرات وقامت في 20 اغسطس / اب من العام نفسه بشن هجمات بصواريخ كروز على مصنع الشفاء للادويه بمدينه الخرطوم بحري القريبه من الخرطوم مما ادى الى توتر دبلوماسي بينها وبين السودان، واصبحت انقاض المصنع منطقه جذب سياحي.\nاحدثت الوفاه المفاجئه لرئيس الحركه الشعبيه لتحرير السودان ونائب الرئيس السوداني انذاك جون قرنق في حادثه طيران في جنوب السودان في يوليو / تموز 2005 م، اعمال شغب عنيفه في الخرطوم لمده ثلاثه ايام، قبل ان تتمكن قوات الامن من السيطره على الوضع.\nفي 23 اكتوبر / تشرين الاول 2012 م تعرض مصنع اليرموك للذخيره بمنطقه الشجره بالخرطوم الى تفجيرات اعلنت الحكومه السودانيه بانها كانت نتيجه غاره جويه اسرائيليه.\n\nالجغرافيا\nالموقع\nتقع الخرطوم في منتصف المساحه الماهوله في السودان تقريباً شمال شرق وسط البلاد بين خط العرض16 درجه شمالاَ وخط العرض 15 درجه جنوباَ وخطي الطول 21 درجه غرباً و 24 درجه شرقاَ، وتتمدد مساحتها البالغه 20736 كيلو متر (12884 ميل) مربع بين الضفه الغربيه لنهر النيل الازرق من الناحيتين الشرقيه والشماليه والضفه الشرقيه للنيل الابيض من الغرب وسهل الجزيره تجاه الجنوب وهي المنطقه القابله لتمدد المدينه عمرانياً.\nوتتوسط الخرطوم ولايات كسلا والقضارف والنيل والجزيره والنيل الابيض وشمال كردفان. وهي ايضا قريبه من ولايات النيل الازرق والشماليه وسنار وجنوب كردفان وتفصلها عن ولايات دار فور الكبرى ارض صحراويه وشبه صحراويه جرداء فقط.\n\nالصوره الطوبوغرافيه\nتقع الخرطوم على ارتفاع 382 متر (1,253,28 قدم) فوق سطح البحر فوق ارض سهليه مستويه السطح مع انحدار طفيف نحو مجرى نهر النيل تتخللها تلال ونتوءات صخريه وكثبان رمليه متفرقه مما يعطي صوره لتضاريس منبسطه مع تموجات طفيفه، وتتخلل هذا المشهد الطبيعي ايضاً طبقات وارصفه اوديه نيليه وخيران ابرزها خور جانقي في منطقه العُشَرَه والصحافه من جهه الشرق، ويتميز الجانب الذي يقع غرب النيل الابيض بانه اكثر انحداراً من جهه النيل الازرق شرقاً، ولهذا فان الخيران التي تقع في الغرب تصب معظمها في النيل ابّان موسم الامطار في حين نجد الخيران الواقعه في الشرق غير منتظمه الفيضان ومعظمها ليس سوى جروف واسعه تفشل في الوصول الى النيل خاصه في الاماكن التي تغطيها مكونات رمليه. ويشكل النيلين الازرق والابيض اهم ظاهره طبيعيه للخرطوم حيث يلتقيان عند نقطه المقرن.\nجيولوجياً، تقع الخرطوم في حوض الخرطوم الذي يشكل جزء من حوض النيل الازرق ويتكون من الصخور المتحوله والصخور الناريه التي تنتمي الى حزام الموزمبيق وتظهر بوضوح في منطقه السبلوقه شمال الخرطوم. والخصائص الجيولوجيه المهمه في الخرطوم هي: الحجر الرملي النوبي، والحجر الرملي المغطى بالجبس والتكتلات الصخريه الرسوبيه. وتبين من دراسه بنيه القشره الارضيه لحوض الخرطوم باستخدام 3 محطات رصد دائمه للزلازل في نطاق 40 كيلومتر (24,8 ميل) من وسط الخرطوم، بان حوض الخرطوم هو واحد من عده احواض متصدعه في السودان مرتبطه مع نظام الاخدود الافريقي الوسيط وان سمك القشره الارضيه تحت حوض الخرطوم يتراوح ما بين 33 (20,5 ميل) و 37 (22,9 ميل) كيلومتر بمتوسط قدره 35 (21,7 ميل) كيلومتر.\n\nملتقى النيلين الازرق والابيض\nيتميز النيل الابيض الذي ياتي الى الخرطوم من جهه الجنوب باتساع مجراه وبطء جريانه وقله انحداره حيث يشبه البحيره الراكده خاصه موسم فيضان النيل الازرق. وبسبب قله سرعه تياره تقل عمليات النحت في ضفافه ويزداد الارساب، وعلى نقيض ذلك يتسم النيل الازرق الذي ينبع من الهضبه الاثيوبيه شرقاً بسرعه التيار وشده الانحدار وعمق المجري. ويلاحظ المرء بوضوح ارتفاع ضفافه في المنطقه القريبه من المقرن على شارع النيل في الخرطوم حيث تم بناء حائط على الضفاف اتقاء لفيضانه، في حين تنعدم هذه الانشاءات في ضفاف النيل الابيض كما يلاحظ سرعه جريانه وقوه تياره من خلال دفعه لمياه النيل الابيض الى الوراء قليلاً عند التقائهما في نقطه المقرن، فضلاً عن ملاحظه الفارق في لون مياه مجراهما حيث يسود مياه النيل الازرق لون الطمي البني الداكن، بينما تجري المياه شبه صافيه بين ضفاف النيل الابيض مما يعطيها بياضاً عند النظر اليها من علو، مقابل زرقه النيل الازرق.\n\nالجزر النيليه\nوتشكل ايضاً معالم سياحيه طبيعيه يزورها العديد من السياح ويقصدها سكان العاصمه المثلثه للاسترواح والتنزه واثناء العطلات والاجازات واهم هذه الجزر:\n\nجزيره توتي\n\nجزيره توتي تقع بين النيل الازرق من الشرق والجنوب، قباله اجمل مناطق الخرطوم (شارع النيل والمقرن) وينطلق منها النيل في رحلته نحو الشمال بعد التقاء رافديه الازرق والابيض من جهه الغرب. تحتضن الجزيره قريه صغيره مساحتها 8 كيلو متر مربع (3 اميال مربعه). يعود تاريخ تاسيسها الى القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي، وتتميز بشواطئها الرمليه وبساتينها التي تنتج الفاكهه والخضر ومن بينها الليمون والبرتقال والجرجير. وتم ربطها بالخرطوم بجسر معلق طوله 310 متر. تستقبل القريه الزوار من العاصمه المثلثه والسياح لقضاء اوقات استجمام وترويح فيها، خاصه في ايام العطلات. وهناك محاولات لبناء منتجع سياحي كبير فيها.\n\nجزيره التمساح\nتقع في وسط النيل الازرق بالقرب من قريه ام دوم جنوب الخرطوم وعرفت بهذا الاسم نسبه لشكلها الذي يشبه شكل التمساح.\n\nجزيره البط\nتوجد فيها اعداد كبيره من الطيور المائيه المستوطنه والمهاجره.\n\nالغابات\nغابه السنط\nتقع في غرب الخرطوم بالقرب من مجرى نهر النيل الابيض وتم اعلانها هي محميه طبيعيه في عام 1939 م وتتكون معظم اشجارها من السنط الذي يقاوم مياه فيضانات النهر خلال فصل الخريف، وتاوي الغابه انواع عديده من الطيور المستوطنه والمهاجره مثل الاوز وطير البقر وخطاف البحر وابو منجل والبط والنورس النهري ومالك الحزين.\n\nالحزام الاخضر\nوهو نطاق من الاشجار من الاشجار الفارعه الارتفاع كاشجار البان التي تم استزراعها في الاطراف الجنوبيه بغرض حمايه المدينه من الزحف الصحراوي والحد من هبوب الرياح القويه نحو المدينه من الجهه التي لا يجري فيها احد فرعي النيل، الا ان التوسع العمراني في العقود الاخيره قد تجاوز حدود هذا النطاق.\n\nالمناخ\nدرجات الحراره\nتعتبر الخرطوم واحده من المدن الرئيسيه الاكثر حراره في العالم. فقد تتجاوز درجات الحراره فيها 48 درجه مئويه (118.4 درجه فهرنهايت) في منتصف الصيف، الا ان المتوسط السنوي لدرجات الحراره القصوى يبلغ حوالي 37.1 درجه مئويه (98.78 فهرنهايت)، مع سته اشهر في السنه يزيد المتوسط الشهري لدرجه الحراره فيها عن 38 درجه مئويه (100.4 فهرنهايت)، ولا يوجد في جدول حاله الطقس الخاص بالخرطوم معدلاً لدرجه الحراره الشهريه يقل عن 30 درجه مئويه (86.5 فهرنهايت)، وهو ما تتم ملاحظته في جداول خاصه بمدن رئيسيه اخرى ذات مناخ صحراوي حار مماثل كالرياض، او بغداد او فينيكس بولايه اريزونا. وفي كل الاحوال فان درجات الحراره في الخرطوم تهبط بمعدلات كبيره خلال الليل، الى ادنى من 15 درجه مئويه (59 فهرنهايت) في شهر يناير / كانون الثاني وقد تصل الى 6 درجات مئويه (42.8 درجه فهرنهايت) عند مرور جبهه هوائيه بارده.\n\nالامطار\nيسود الخرطوم في معظم اشهر السنه المناخ الصحراوي الحار الجاف باستثناء شهري يوليو / تموز واغسطس / اب، حيث تسقط الامطار المداريه الشديده، بمعدل يزيد قليلاً على 155 مليمتر (6.1 بوصه) سنوياً في المتوسط، وفي الفتره من ديسمبر / كانون الاول وحتى فبراير / شباط حيث تنخفض درجه الحراره نسبياُ.\nوفي الشتاء وهي الفتره من ديسمبر / كانون الاول وحتى فبراير / شباط يكون الجو لطيفاً الى حد ما، حيث تنخفض درجات الحراره في الصباح وحتى الظهيره وبعد غروب الشمس. وتتراوح درجه الحراره خلال هذه الفتره ما بين 32 درجه مئويه (89.6 درجه فهرنهايت) 28 درجه مئويه (82.4 فهرنهايت).\n\nحركه الرياح\nثمه ظاهره مناخيه في السودان تعرف بالهبوب وهو عاصفه ترابيه نشطه تحدث في مناطق وسط السودان بما فيها الخرطوم وذلك عندما تهب رياح جنوبيه رطبه في شهري مايو / ايار ويوليو / تموز ويمكن ان تقلل بشكل مؤقت مدى الرؤيه الى الصفر.\nانسب وقت لزياره الخرطوم من حيث المناخ هي الفتره ما بين شهري نوفمبر / تشرين الثاني ومارس / اذار.\n\nالاداره\nالخرطوم هي محليه من محليات ولايه الخرطوم التي تضم ايضاً الخرطوم بحري وام درمان وشرق النيل ومحليات اُخرى.\nكانت تتكون محليه الخرطوم من ثلاث وحدات اداريه هي:\n\nوحده الخرطوم وتضم احياء ومناطق:\n\nُ\nالخرطوم شمال، البراري، امتداد ناصر، الخرطوم وسط، الديوم الشرقيه، الديوم الغربيه، الشجره الجنوبيه، الشجره الشماليه، العمارات، الخرطوم1، الخرطوم 2، الخرطوم3، الخرطوم غرب، المنطقه الصناعيه، الخرطوم السوق الشعبي، الكلاكلات.\n\nوحده الشهدا وتشمل احياء ومناطق:\nالصحافه وجبره، الامتداد، العشره، السوق المحلي، السوق المركزي، الدوحه، وسوبا الشاحنات.\n\nوحده الخرطوم شرق وتتبع لها:\nاركويت شرق، اركويت غرب، الطائف، المنشيه، الجريف غرب، المطار، جاردن سيتي، الرياض.\nحالياً، تحتوي خارطه المحليه الاداريه على ست وحدات اداريه تشمل:-\n\nوحده الخرطوم شمال الاداريه\nوحده الخرطوم شرق الاداريه\nوحده الخرطوم غرب الاداريه\nوحده الخرطوم وسط الاداريه\nوحده الشهداء وسوبا الاداريه\nوحده الشجره الاداريه\nوتتولى هذه الوحدات الاداريه مهمه تقديم الخدمات العامه للمواطنين على نحو اشبه بما تقوم به البلديات والجماعات الحضريه في عواصم اخرى، ويشرف على اداره المحليه رئيس يسمى المعتمد، الا ان والي الولايه يمثل اعلى سلطه اداريه في الخرطوم.\n\nالسياحه\nتعتبر الخرطوم احدى المراكز السياحيه المهمه في السودان، ليس فقط باعتبارها عاصمه البلاد وواحده من اكبر مدنها، بل لوجود عدد من المقومات السياحيه مثل المتاحف والاثار والحدائق والفضاءات الخضراء الى جانب الانديه الرياضيه والمهرجانات وغيرها من الفعاليات.\n\nالمتاحف\nهناك عده متاحف في الخرطوم اهمها هي:\n\nالمتحف القومي المُطل على نهر النيل الازرق وفي منطقه المقرن ويحتوي على مقتنيات اثريه من مختلف انحاء السودان، يمتد تاريخها الى عصور ما قبل التاريخ، وحتى فتره الممالك النوبيه وتشتمل الصالات الداخليه للمتحف على العديد من المقتنيات المعروضه في شكل منحوتات وانيه فخاريه وزجاجيه وخشبيه ومعدنيه، وادوات زينه وصور حائطيه في حين يشتمل فناء المتحف على عدد من المعابد والمدافن والنصب التذكاريه، والتماثيل القديمه باحجام مختلفه، التي نقلت من مناطق استكشافها في شمال السودان، واهمها معابد (سمنه شرق) و (سمنه غرب) وبوهين، ومقبره الامير (حجو تو حتب) واعمده كاتدرائيه فرس. كما يضم المتحف مقتنيات اثريه يرجع تاريخها الى العصر الحجري القديم وحتى نهايه فتره سلطنه سنار في عام 1821 م.\nمتحف التاريخ الطبيعي، يقع في شارع الجامعه ويحتوى على حيوانات محنطه واخرى حيّه بهدف التعريف بما هو متوافر في السودان من زواحف وطيور ومواشي وحشرات تعريفاً علمياً، وتلعب جامعه الخرطوم دوراً مهماً في استمراريه هذا المتحف والحفاظ عليه، ومن الطيور الموجوده فيه صقر الجديان الذي يمثل شعار السودان.\nمتحف القصر، وتعرض فيه لوحات زيتيه وصور فوتوغرافيه لحكام السودان منذ الحكم الثنائي في عام 1889 م، وحتى فتره ما بعد الاستقلال وبعض السيارات الرئاسيه التي كانوا يستخدمونها خلال فتره حكمهم وما تلقّاه الرؤساء الوطنيين من هدايا اضافه الى الالات الموسيقيه وقطع الاواني والاثاث التي استخدمت في القصر الرئاسي. ويقع المتحف في مبنى كنيسه اثريه بيزنطيه المعمار داخل جزء من الحديقه الجنوبيه الشرقيه للقصر.\nمتحف الاثنوغرافيا في ملتقى شارع الجامعه بشارع المك نمر وتعرض فيه نماذج من الادويه التقليديه المستعمله في الحياه اليوميه بالسودان ونماذج من اسلحه الصيد وادوات الزراعه والانتاج لدى القبائل المختلفه بالسودان الى جانب نماذج من ازيائهم والاتهم لموسيقيه، ومركز الفولكلور التابع للهيئه القوميه للاداب والفنون.\nالمتحف الحربي (العسكري)، بوزاره الدفاع وفيه مجموعه من نماذج الاسلحه الاثريه المختلفه والازياء العسكريه والدروع والصور والخرائط العسكريه التاريخيه.\n\nالمعالم الاثريه\nالقباب العثمانيه التي تقع شرق ساحه ابو جنزير في وسط الخرطوم ويرجع تاريخها الى بدايات العهد العثماني بالسودان في سنه 1839 م، وتضم مقابر لمشاهير القاده والعسكريين الاتراك في السودان ومن بينهم مؤسس الخرطوم الحكمدار عثمان جركس باشا البرنجي.\nموقع سوبا شرق النيل الاثري جنوب الخرطوم بحرى، الذي يضم اثار عاصمه مملكه علوه المسيحيه من القرن السادس الى القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي، ومن بينها بقايا كنيسه قديمه.\nالمباني الاثريه ومنها القصر الجمهوري ومبنى البريد المركزي ومعمل استاك وغيرها تضاف الى ذلك المعالم السياحيه في كل من ام درمان والخرطوم بحري على الضفاف الاخرى لنهري النيل (الازرق والابيض) والتي يمكن الوصول اليها من الخرطوم بسهوله.\n\nالحدائق النباتيه والحيوانيه\nتوجد في الخرطوم حديقه نباتيه تبلغ مسلحتها 11 فدان وتحتوى على انواع عديده ونادره من النباتات، كما توجد حديقه للحيوانات في غابه السنط ويجري العمل على انشاء حديقه سفاري.\n\nالسياحه النهريه\nتشتهر الخرطوم ايضاً بالسياحه النهريه على نهر النيل حيث توجد البواخر النيليه وقوارب الفلوكه والزوارق والقوارب الشراعيه والعبّارات والتي تمخر مياه النيلين الازرق والابيض وتعبر بركابها الى جزيره توتي وسط النيل حيث البساتين التقليديه النضره. وتوجد المراكب بالقرب من المقرن وجزيره توتي وجزيره التمساح، وتقوم برحلات نهاريه وليليه.\n\nرحلات السفاري\nيتميز السودان بتباين نطاقه المناخي والبيئي وهو ما يتّضح جلياً في وجود انواع كثيره من الحيوانات والطيور وتقوم شركات ومكاتب السفاري والرحلات البريه في الخرطوم بتنظيم رحلات مرخصه للصيد ذهاباً واياباً منها رحلات سفاري الغزلان، وسفاري صيد البط، والحمام البري الذي يمتد موسم صيده من نوفمبر / تشرين الثاني وحتى فبراير / شباط من العام.\n\nالمناطق الطبيعيه\nشلال السبلوقه\nيقع شلال السبلوقه على بعد 80 كيلو متر من الخرطوم ويتبع ادارياً لولايه نهر النيل وهو عباره عن كتل صخريه في وسط مجرى نهر النيل تعترض تدفق المياه، ويعرف ايضاً باسم الشلال السادس او الجندل السادس باعتباره سادس واخر العقبات الصخريه وسط مجرى نهر النيل ويشكل مقصداً للسياح خاصه السياح العرب والاجانب وذلك لطبيعه المنطقه التي تجمع بين التلال والمياه والجزر والكثبان الصحراويه والحياه البريه وتقام فيها رحلات نيليه.\n\nمقرن النيلين\nالمقرن في الخرطوم هو نقطه تلاقي رافدي نهر النيل وهما النيل الازرق القادم من الهضبه الاثيوبيه والنيل الابيض القادم من وسط افريقيا في مشهد طبيعي يشد الانتباه، حيث يلاحظ المرء كيف تسير مياه النيل الازرق الطينيه الداكنه ومياه النيل الابيض الصافيه جنباً الى جنب، ثم يختلطان مع بعضهما ويصبحان نهراً واحداً في مجرى واسع ذو مياه خفيفه الزرقه. وتوجد في المنطقه عده منتزهات ومتاحف وفنادق وجسر يربط المنطقه بام درمان.\n\nمنطقه جبل اولياء في الجنوب الغربي من الخرطوم، حيث السد القديم والبحيره التي خلفه ويشكلان بيئه نهريه زاخره بالاسماك والطيور والنباتات.\n\nالخدمات العامه\nالتعليم\nتعتبر الخرطوم قطباً مهماً للتعليم العالي في السودان، حيث تتركز فيها الجامعات والمعاهد العليا.وقد شهدت انشاء اول مدرسه نظاميه للسودان واول كليه جامعيه هي كليه غوردون التذكاريه التي تحول فيما بعد الى جامعه. كما يوجد بها العديد من المدارس بما في ذلك مدارس الجاليات الاجنبيه المقيمه فيها. وتستضيف الخرطوم المعهد الدولي لتعليم اللغه العربيه لغير الناطقين بها، الذي تم تاسيسه بالتعاون مع المنظمه العربيه للتربيه والثقافه والعلوم.\nعرفت الخرطوم التعليم منذ انشائها على يد فقهاء مدارس خلاويها فقد تزامن تاريخ تاسيسها مع قيام المدارس القرانيه فيها والتي انحصر دورها على التعاليم المرتبطه بالعقيده من تحفيظ سور القران وتفسيرها ومبادئ الفقه وقواعد اللغه العربيه واساسيات الحساب. وفي العهد العثماني تم افتتاح عده مدارس نظاميه حديثه في السودان من بينها مدرسه الخرطوم الابتدائيه التي افتتحت سنه 1855 م، لتعليم ابناء الموظفين الاتراك تحت اشراف العالم رفاعه رافع الطهطاوي الذي نفي الى السودان انذاك، ومنذ ذلك الحين انتشرت المدارس في المدينه على اختلاف مراحلها ومناهج التدريس فيها. ويمكن تقسيم المدارس في الخرطوم الى مدارس عامه حكوميه اصبح لبعضها شهره على نطاق السودان واخرى خاصه يديرها القطاع الخاص وتشمل هذه الفئه مدارس الجاليات الاجنبيه والتي ساهم بعضها بقدر كبير في مجال التعليم بالمدينه مثل مدارس البعثه المصريه واكبرها مدرسه جمال عبد الناصر الثانويه ومدارس الكليه القبطيه ومدارس كمبوني ومدرسه الراهبات والمدارس العالميه. وازداد عدد هذه المدارس في نهايه القرن الماضي ليشمل مدارس تدرس بلغات غير اللغتين العربيه والانجليزيه السائدتين في المجال التعليمي في الخرطوم ومن بينها المدرسه الارمنيه والمدرسه التركيه. ومن مدارس الجاليات الاجنبيه: المدرسه البريطانيه ومدرسه الاتحاد والمدرسه الامريكيه ومدرسه كامبريدج العالميه ومدرسه البارون والمدارس العالميه\nبلغ عدد المؤسسات التعليميه في ولايه الخرطوم في عام 2011م، حوالي 3000 منها 1600 مدرسه في مرحله الاساس و450 في المرحله الثانويه بالاضافه الى المدارس الخاصه ومؤسسات التعليم قبل المدرسي ومراكز تعليم الكبار.\nجدول بالجامعات والمعاهد العليا الكبيره الموجوده في الخرطوم:\n\nانظر ايضا\n\nقائمه الجامعات في السودان\n\nالرعايه الصحيه\nتوجد في الخرطوم عده مؤسسات صحيه وطبيه بما في ذلك المستشفيات والمستوصفات الطبيه وعيادات الاطباء الخاصه والاخصائيين الى جانب مكاتب مؤسسات التامينات الصحيه. ومن تلك المستشفيات، مستشفى الخرطوم التعليمي ومستشفى الشعب ومستشفى العيون ومستشفى الذره ومستشفى الاسنان وكلها تقع بوسط الخرطوم، الى جانب مجموعه كبيره من المستشفيات الخاصه منها مستشفى ابن سينا ومستشفى ابن خلدون والمستشفى السعودي والمستشفى التركي وغيرها. وتنتشر الصيدليات في المدينه ومجمعاتها العلاجيه.\nوتتقاسم اداره النظام الصحي في الخرطوم جهتان، هما الحكومه المركزيه ووزاره الصحه الاقليميه. وتشرف الحكومه المركزيه على حوالي 18 مستشفى في ولايه الخرطوم معظمها مستشفيات كبيره وعامه منها مستشفى الخرطوم التعليمي ومستشفى ابن سينا، بينما تشرف وزاره الصحه الاقليميه على المراكز الصحيه وحوالي 30 مستشفى صغير في مدن العاصمه المثلثه وضواحيها. ونظراً للتنافس الكبير بين هذه المستشفيات والمؤسسات الصحيه وعدم تكاملها فان الكثير من الموارد يتم اهدارها حيث تحصل المستشفيات الكبيره على دعم حكومي مما يجعلها تستقطب العدد الكبير من المرضى الامر الذي يشكل حاله من التكدس اضافه الى مشاكل التنقل على نحو يستدعي الاصلاح خاصه بعد التدهور الكبير في القطاع الصحي. واول تحد يواجه الاصلاح هو التوسع في الخدمات ونقلها الى خارج مركز العاصمه. والى جانب ذلك تشرف وزاره الصحه الاقليميه على نظام التامين الصحي بقسط قدره 25 جنيه سوداني (4 دولارات) شهرياً لجميع افراد العائله الواحده بينما يدفع العمال حوالي 60% من صندوق التامين الصحي وتغطي الحكومه النسبه المتبقيه. وتتولى صناديق الزكاه والاعمال الخيريه دفع اقساط مقدره من تامينات الاسر.\nاكبر مستشفى في الخرطوم هو مستشفى الخرطوم التعليمي الواقع على شارع الطابيه بوسط الخرطوم وتبلغ عدد الاسره فيه 750 سرير (عام 2013) واصغرها هو المستشفى السويدي في حي الجريف غرب الواقع شرق المدينه بالقرب من مطار الخرطوم الدولي وعدد الاسره فيه 30 سريراً. وهناك مستشفى الذره بشارع القصر وبه حوالي 141 سرير ومستشفى ابن سينا بشارع اللواء محمد نجيب ويسع لحوالي 147 سرير.\nاما عدد المستوصفات والمراكز الصحيه الاخرى فيبلغ حوالي 91 مستوصف و7 وحدات صحيه خاصه و11 مركز صحي. ويوجد في الخرطوم القومسيون الطبي وهو هيئه طبيه اداريه تقوم بمهمه استخراج شهادات التطعيم الدوليه وتحديد القياه الصحيه للافراد لاغراض التعيين في وظائف معينه ومواقع بيع الاطعمه وغيرها من المهام ذات الصله.\n\nالفندقه والمطاعم\nالفنادق\n\nتنتشر في مختلف ارجاء الخرطوم العديد من الفنادق على مختلف الدرجات ويتركز بعضها على ضفاف النيل بشارع النيل.\nومن تلك الفنادق فندق كورينثيا- برج الفاتح سابقاً وفندق كورال (الهيلتون سابقا) وفندق قصر الصداقه وفندق السلام روتانا وفندق جراند هوليداي وفندق مريديان (ريجينسى حاليا)وفندق شهرزاد وفنادق الاكروبول وصحارى وقباء وبلازا والبحرين وسنترال وكانون والحجاز ومشيريب والتاكا هاوس والفيصل سفاري بالاس والسواحلي والاراك وبحر الغزال وبيت الضيافه الالماني وفندق افريقيا وفندق الرياض الجديد وغيرها.\n\nالمطاعم\n\nتوجد في الخرطوم عده مطاعم تقدم مختلف الاطباق السودانيه والاجنبيه فهناك مطاعم تقدم اطباق لبنانيه كما في مطعم البستان على شارع افريقيا واطباق باكستانيه كما في مطعم سولت-ان-بيبر (ملح وفلفل) ومطعم الحبشه للطعام الاثيوبي في منطقه اركويت، والاطباق اليمنيه في مطعم حضرموت في سوق الخرطوم 2، والصينيه في مول (مجمع) عفراء والكوريه في شارع افريقيا والشاورما والكباب في شارع المطار، واللحوم في كانيفوري ويمكن تذوق الاطعمه السودانيه التقليديه في المطعم الشعبي 15. معظم المطاعم تتركز في مناطق العمارات والخرطوم 2 والرياض. وبعض المطاعم مزود بشاشات عرض وموسيقى حيه وانترنت. ويزخر شارع افريقيا وشارع النيل بالعديد من المطاعم والمقاهي.\n\nالاسواق والسوبرماركات\nتوجد بوسط الخرطوم سوقان رئيسيتان هما السوق العربي والسوق الافرنجي. وكلاهما قريبان من بعضهما من حيث المسافه ولكنهما تختلفان من حيث السلع المعروضه. فالاولى سوق تقليديه تعرض فيها السلع والمنتوجات المحليه المختلفه من الحبوب والتوابل، الى ادوات الزينه والذهب ومواد البناء والتشييد.والثانيه تضم محلات تجاريه تبيع السلع المستورده من اقمشه وقطع اثاث وتحف وما شابه ذلك. وهناك ايضاً اسواقاً مركزيه للخضر واللحوم، الى جانب السوق الشعبي.\nتوجد في الخرطوم عده سوبر ماركات محليه منتشره في الاحياء الراقيه، منها مول عفراء التجاري الذي تم تاسيسه في عام 4 م، بمنطقه اركويت وتتنوع الخدمات فيه من محلات تجاريه ومطاعم واماكن ترفيه الى موقف للسيارات. وهناك مول مركز العمارات والواحه مول الذي يتكون من اربعه ابراج وبه منطقه خضراء ومحلات تجاريه ومكاتب للشركات والافراد، ومركز واحه الخرطوم وهو واحد من المراكز التجاريه الحديثه في الخرطوم.\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nساعد موقع الخرطوم في وسط البلاد تقريباً على تسهيل ربطها بكافه عواصم ومدن ولايات السودان المختلفه، براً عبر الطرق الممهده والطرق الموسميه وجواً عبر الطيران الداخلي وبالبواخر النيليه عبر نهر النيل وبقطارات السكك الحديديه. اما داخل المدينه فتتنوع وسائل النقل من سياره الاجره الصفراء اللون وحافلات المدينه وغيرها من الحافلات الاخرى على مختلف الاحجام وتسمى بالباصات، كما تستخدم الدراجات الناريه ثلاثيه العجلات المعروفه بالتوك توك وتعرف في الخرطوم باسم الرقشه، فضلاً عن القطارات والعبارات النيليه.\n\nالنقل الجوي\nيوجد في الخرطوم مطار واحد وهو مطار الخرطوم الدولي لخدمه الركاب داخل السودان وخارجه، ويعتبر اكبر مطار في السودان. ويقع وسط مدينه الخرطوم، رمزه في منظمه النقل الجوي الدولي (اياتا) هو KRT وفي المنظمه الدوليه للطيران المدني (ايكاو) هو HSSS، ويبلغ طول مدرجه 2980 متر اي 9777 قدم ، وهو مرتبط بخطوط الى معظم المطارات الدوليه بالبلدان العربيه ومن بينها خط جده والقاهره ودمشق وطرابلس ودبي، وعدد من المطارات بالدول الاوربيه مثل مطارات اثينا ولندن وامستردام واسطنبول والاسيويه مثل بكين والافريقيه كاسمره واديس ابابا ونيروبي وغيرها. ويرتبط المطار بخطوط داخليه تتجه نحو المطارات المنتشره في ولايات السودان المختلفه مثل مطارات بورتسودان ونيالا والقضارف ودنقلا وكوستي.\nيجري العمل حالياً على انشاء مطار دولي جديد، بعيداً عن مركز العاصمه وذلك لعده اسباب اهمها وقوع المطار القديم في وسط المدينه مما يشكل خطوره على السكان وعائق امام بناء المباني الشاهقه والمرتفعه في الخرطوم، فضلاً عن زياده الطلب على الرحلات الدوليه للخرطوم، مما يستدعي بناء مطار جديد يستوفي المعايير الدوليه من حيث مدرجات الاقلاع والهبوط وصالات المسافرين وغيرها من المرافق الاخرى.\n\nالنقل النهري\nيوجد في الخرطوم ميناء نهري للنقل والسفر الى المدن الواقعه على ضفاف النيل الابيض جنوب الخرطوم حتى مدينه كوستي، كما يقدم خدمات سياحيه تتمثل في الرحلات النيليه وخدمات القوارب الشراعيه والزوارق في النيل. ويقع المقر الرئيسي للميناء في الخرطوم بحري. وهناك عبّاره (ويطلق عليها في السودان مَعدّيه) نهريه تقوم برحلات منتظمه لنقل الركاب والبضائع بين الخرطوم وجزيره توتي الواقعه في مجري نهر النيل.\n\nالطرق السريعه والجسور والانفاق\n\nترتبط الخرطوم بمدن السودان المختلفه بشبكه من الطرق السريعه ومنها شارع الخرطوم - ود مدني والخرطوم - القضارف والخرطوم- بورتسودان والخرطوم -دنقلا وغيرها.\nاما في الداخل فهناك بعض الشوارع الرئيسيه المشهوره من حيث طولها او المنطقه التي تشقها ومنها شارع افريقيا وشارع النيل ام درمان، وشارع القصر وهو احد اطول شوارع الخرطوم وشارع عبيد ختم وشارع الجمهوريه وشارع علي عبد اللطيف وشارع المك نمر. ويتم حالياً تنفيذ مشاريع لتوسعه شبكه الطرق الداخليه وتطويرها لتسهيل انسياب الحركه في المدينه مثل شارع النيل الخرطوم السريع والطريق الدائري.\n\nالخرطوم هي احدى مدن العاصمه المثلثه ولذلك فهي ترتبط بام درمان والخرطوم بحري بعده جسور مقامه على النيلين:الازرق والابيض وهي:\n\nكوبري النيل الابيض القديم حيث يربط الخرطوم مع ام درمان.\nكوبري الانقاذ حيث يربط الخرطوم مع ام درمان.\nكوبري النيل الازرق القديم حيث يربط الخرطوم مع الخرطوم بحري.\nكوبري بُري (القوات المسلحه)حيث يربط الخرطوم مع الخرطوم بحري.\nكوبري توتي حيث يربط الخرطوم مع جزيره توتي التي توجد في النيل الازرق.\nكوبري المك نمر حيث يربط الخرطوم مع خرطوم بحري.\nكوبري المنشيه حيث يربط الخرطوم مع شرق النيل.\nكوبري الدباسين حيث يربط بين الخرطوم وامدرمان ويوجد علي النيل الابيض (تحت الانشاء).\nالسكك الحديديه\n\nتعتبر الخرطوم احدى مراكز خطوط السكك الحديديه في السودان، حيث تتجه نحوها كافه الخطوط الممتده من الولايات المختلفه شرقاً (من جهه كسلا - القضارف - ود مدني) وغرباً (من نيالا - الابيض عبر تقاطع سنار في الوسط) وشمالاً (من وادي حلفا مروراً بابو حمد وعطبره) ومن كريمه في الشمال الغربي الى الخرطوم، فضلاً عن ذلك تعمل قطارات السكك الحديديه على نقل الركاب داخل مدينه الخرطوم من مناطق الكلاكله في اقصى جنوب المدينه الى وسط الخرطوم. وتوجد محطه للقطارات في الخرطوم بحري. وكانت المدينه تعرف نظام الترامواي في ثلاثينيات القرن الماضي قبل ان تتم ازاله خطوطها بعد فتره الاستقلال في وجه التمدد العمراني وكثافه حركه المرور بوسط المدينه.\n\nالعماره والتخطيط العمراني\nتوالت عمليات تخطيط الخرطوم منذ تشكيل اول لجنه للتخطيط العمراني في عام 1927 م، وكان ابرزها تخطيط عام 1946 و1950 والذي شمل توسيع الطرق والشوارع وانشاء الحدائق العامه والميادين ويناء امتدادات جديده في الاحياء لاستيعاب موجات الهجره السكانيه نحو العاصمه. ونتيجه للنمو الديمغرافي والرغبه في تجميل العاصمه شهدت الخرطوم عمليه تخطيط في عام 1958، خاصه في المنطقه القريبه من مقرن النيلين وبرز نمط معماري جديد مغاير للنمط الاستعماري، كما تكررت العمليه التخطيطيه في عام 1977 و1990 م في المنطقه نفسها.\nلا يوجد نمط معماري معين او لون طلاء محدد تتميز به الخرطوم اذ توجد مختلف الاشكال والانماط والالوان في المدينه، الا ان من الممكن التمييز بين خطوط معماريه واضحه في طراز الابنيه من حيث تاريخ بنائها، ففي المنطقه الشماليه المطله على النيل الازرق يظهر النمط الكولونيالي الذي يعود الى القرن التاسع عشر والعصر الفيكتوري وما قبله وفن العماره المملوكيه الاسلاميه ويتمثل في مباني الوزارات والدواوين الحكوميه القديمه التي بناها الاتراك ومن بينها سراي الحكمدار (القصر الجمهوري القديم) في المنطقه المحاذيه للنيل الازرق، ويلاحظ ان هذه المنطقه قد تم تخطيط شوارعها في عهد كتشنر على شكل العلم البريطاني (الصلبان المتقاطعه راسياً وافقياً وعرضياً) مستنداً في تخطيطه بشكل عام على مخطط وشنطن الامريكي مع ادخال بعض العناصر العسكريه كبناء ثكنات الجنود (داخليات جامعه الخرطوم حالياً). (في عام 1908 م، تم تنفيذ مخطط ملكين وهو بمثابه تعديل لتخطيط كتشنر متاثر بتخطيط جاردن سيتي في القاهره).\nويسود المنطقه التي تليها جنوباً معمار خمسينيات وستينيات القرن الماضي ومن ابرز امثلته امتداد فندق السودان، وكلما ابتعدنا جنوباً من النيل او اتجهنا نحو اطرافه الشماليه في منطقه المقرن نجد نماذج لانماط العماره المعاصره مثل قصر المؤتمرات (المسمى بقاعه الصداقه) والذي بناه الصينيون في سبعينيات القرن الماضي وهو شبيه بمباني ميدان السلام الابدي في بكين، والعماره الحديثه ممثله فندق كورينثيا، برج الفاتح سابقاً المبني على شكل بيضه نعام ضخمه ومبنى بنك السودان المركزي الجديد ذو الواجهه الزجاجيه.\nتشمل العماره الحديثه مباني الابراج العاليه مثل برج الاتصالات سوداتيل الذي يتكون من 29 طابقاً وبرج شركه بترودار واداره الخطوط الجويه السودانيه وابراج القوات المسلحه المصمم احدها في شكل بارجه والاخر على شكل طائره وهي من المباني التي تاحذ اشكالاً هندسيه وفقاً لدور المؤسسه التي انشاتها كمقر لها. وتتركز مباني الابراج في وسط الخرطوم ومنطقتي المقرن وبري.\n\nالميادين والحدائق العامه\n\nاهتم مؤسسو مدينه الخرطوم بالخضره في المدينه، فقاموا بتشجير شوارعها باشجار ظليله كاشجار اللبخ والنيم التي اقيمت على طول الضفه الشرقيه للنيل الازرق والتي تم جلبها من بلدان كالهند، كما شجعوا الاهالي على زراعه الاشجار واقامه الحدائق في منازلهم وكانت تجرى وحتى سنوات قريبه مسابقات حول اجمل الحدائق المنزليه في منطقه الخرطوم عموم. وفي ستينيات القرن الماضي اقيمت حدائق في الاحياء البعيده عن مركز المدينه مثل حديقه القرشي وفي سبعينيات القرن ذاته تم تخصيص مساحات واسعه مكسوه بالحشائش والشجيرات في المنطقه القريبه من المقرن. وفي السنوات الاخيره تم نشر اشجار النخيل في عدد من شوارع المدينه وساحاتها الخضراء. وزاد الاهتمام بالحدائق العامه والبيئه الخضراء وذلك في ضوء تزايد نسبه انبعاث الكربون من السيارات والمصانع ومن هذه الحدائق الساحه الخضراء وهي عباره عن فضاء متعدد الاغراض حيث توجد فيه ملاعب ومرافق رياضيه متاحه للجمهور مضامير لرياضه المشي والعدو ومسرح ثقافي على الهواء الطلق وملاعب اطفال واماكن ترويح وتحيط بها بضعه محلات تجاريه صغيره لبيع التحف وغيرها ومطاعم ومكتبه عامه.\nومن ابرز الحدائق العامه والمنتزهات الاخرى:\n\nوالى جانب المنتزهات والحدائق العامه توجد بضعه بساتين توفر بعضها اماكن للرحلات الخلويه بعد الاتفاق مع اصحابها، ومنها بساتين الجريف غرب وبساتين جزيره توتي.\nكما توجد في الخرطوم عده ميادين وساحات عامه ومنها ميدان جمال عبد الناصر (المحطه الوسطى سابقاً) ميدان محطه السوق العربي وميدان ابو جنزير، وميدان الامم المتحده في وسط المدينه، وميدان المولد في الخرطوم جنوب.\nومع ذلك فان الخرطوم في حاجه الى مزيد من الساحات والميادين والمنتزهات والحدائق العامه الواسعه المساحه واعاده تاهيل الاماكن الخضراء الحاليه والعنايه بها.\n\nالمساجد دور العباده\n\nيدين اغلب سكان الخرطوم بالاسلام، ولذلك توجد بالمدينه اعداداً كبيره من المساجد. وقد تسارعت وتيره انشاء المساجد في الخرطوم بالاحياء وبالمؤسسات وشرعت الطرق الصوفيه والجماعات الدينيه بانشاء مساجد خاصه بها. وانتشرت في الاونه الاخيره ظاهره المساجد التي تقام في المؤسسات ومن بينها مسجد القوات المسلحه في مقر قياده القوات المسلحه السودانيه جوار قاعه الشهيد الزبير ومسجد القصر في ساحه القصر الجمهوري وغيرها من المساجد المنشره باحجام مختلفه في مقرات المؤسسات الحكوميه وشركات القطاع الخاص والمؤسسات التعليميه والصحيه. ومن المساجد الكبيره والبارزه في وسط الخرطوم مسجد جامعه الخرطوم ومسجد الشهيد والجامع العتيق (مسجد الخرطوم الكبير) او مسجد عباس سابقاً، الذي افتتحه الخديوي عباس حلمي باشا في 4 ديسمبر / كانون الاول 1901 م، عند زيارته للسودان. وتتنوع انماط الهندسه المعماريه لهذه المساجد من الطراز المملوكي القديم كما في جامع فاروق الى الطراز العُثماني كما في مسجد النور والهندسه المعماريه الحديثه في مسجد جامعه الخرطوم. وتوجد بمعظم المساجد مدارس قرانيه تدرس علوم الفقه والتوحيد وغيرها من الدروس الدينيه وخلاويها لتعليم النشء كيف الصلاه وغيرها من العبادات وتحفيظ القران.\n\nوللمسيحيه تاريخاَ طويلاَ في الخرطوم يعود الى دوله علوه التي اعتنقت الديانه المسيحيه في سنه 580 ميلاديه وكانت عاصمتها سوبا (احدى ضواحي الخرطوم حاليا) قبل ان تتعرض للتخريب على يد الفونج في سنه 1504 م،\nثم في العهد العثماني عندما اصبح اراكيل باشا الارمني المسيحي حاكماً عاماً للسودان في سنه 1857 وخلال فتره الحكم الثنائي الذي كان على راسه حكام بريطانيون.\n(انظر: ملحق حكام السودان).\nوفي 3 ابريل / نيسان 1846 قرر بابا الفاتيكان غريغوري السادس عشر انشاء مطرانيه رسوليه لوسط افريقيا مع ابرشيه في الخرطوم وتتبع لها اليوم اربع كنائس في الخرطوم بما فيها كاتدرائيه القديس متى والقديس بطرس في منطقه الامتداد الجديد بالخرطوم.\nوتتبع لهذه الكنائس مدارس ومنظمات من بينها مدرسه فيلا جيلدا للبنات التابعه للكنيسه الارثوذكسيه بشارع 21 اكتوبر، المتقاطع مع شارع الطيار جميل، ومدارس كمبوني على شارع القصر التي اسسها الاسقف دانيال كمبوني.\nوكان في الخرطوم كنيس يهودي يقع في شارع القصر (شارع فكتوريا سابقا) مبنى على طراز معابد السفارديم ويعمل على خدمه اليهود قبل مغادرتهم السودان في اواخر ستينيات القرن الماضي، الى جانب مقبره يهوديه قديمه بالخرطوم عند مدخل المنطقه الصناعيه، جنوب كوبري الحريه.\n\nاسماء الشوارع والميادين العامه في الخرطوم\nتفتقر الخرطوم الى خطه واضحه فيما يتعلق باسماء الاحياء السكنيه والشوارع والميادين العامه، فضلا عن ان معظمها لا توجد عليه لوحات تدل علي اسمه ولا على ارقام العقارات والمنازل المطله عليه حسبما هو وارد في خططها التخطيطيه العديده، وتتنوع مصادر الاسماء الموجوده والمتعارف عليها فبعض الاحياء السكنيه مثلاً يحمل اسماء احياء او مدن عربيه ظهرت بعض موجات الهجره الى تلك البلدان خاصه دول الخليج ومن هذه الاحياء: الرياض والطائف (مدن سعوديه) والدوحه (مدينه قطريه) والمنشيه والجاردن سيتي (احياء مدن مصريه) والاندلس (مغربيه) ووالقادسيه (عراقيه).\nومن اسماء الشوارع: شارع غوردون (نسبه للجنرال غوردون باشا) حاكم السودان في اواخر فتره حكم التركيه السابقه في السودان وتبدل اسمه بعد استقلال السودان في عام 1956 وفي اطار سياسه السودنه الي شارع الجامعه (نسبه الى جامعه الخرطوم المطله عليه)، وشارع فكتوريا (نسبه للملكه فكتوريا ملكه بريطانيا) واصبح شارع القصر، وهناك شارع ونجت باشا سمي باسم (ريجنالد ونجت حاكم عام السودان في الفتره 1899 - 1916، واصبح اسمه لاحقاً شارع البرلمان اما شارع السردار (وهو قائد القوات البريطانيه ابان فتره الاستعمار الحكم الثنائي) اصبح شارع الجمهوريه وشارع الدفتردار (نسب الى الدفتردار محمد، صهر محمد على باشا في سنه 1821 م) اصبح شارع المك نمر (نسبه للمك نمر حاكم شندي الذي قتل قائد الجيش العثماني المصري في سنه 1821 م) وشارع اسماعيل باشا (نسبه الى اسماعيل باشا نجل محمد علي باشا وقائد الحمله على السودان قي سنه 1821م) واصبح شــارع علي عبد اللطيف (احد رموز المقاومه الوطنيه ضد الاستعمار البريطاني في السودان) وشارع محمد نجيب (اول رئيس وزراء مصر ي بعد ثوره تموز / يوليو 1952 م) ولم يتغير اسم الشارع تخليداً لذكرى محمد نجيب ذو الاصول والسودانيه (امه مصريه وابوه سوداني) كذلك لم يتغير اسم شارع كاترينا نسبه الى مدام كاترينا اليونانيه الاصل وصاحبه متجر في ستينيات القرن الماضي كان يقع شرق حديقه القرشي بالخرطوم والتي بدورها كانت تعرف باسم حديقه عبود في عام 1960 نسبه الى الرئيس ابراهيم عبود وتحولت الى حديقه القرشي نسبه الى شهيد ثوره اكتوبر احمد القرشي والتي اطاحت بحكومه الرئيس عبود. ومن شوارع الخرطوم الاخرى التي تحمل اسماء سودانيه شارع السيد عبد الرحمن (نسبه الى عبد الرحمن المهدي زعيم طائفه الانصار ورمز منم رموز الاستقلال) وشارع السيد علي الميرغني (زعيم طائفه الختميه واحد رموز الاستقلال)، وشارع عبيد ختم الذي سمي على الشهيد عبيد ختم، وهي تسميه جديده وشارع البلابل (نسبه الى فرقه البلابل| الغنائيه المشهوره في السودان). واطلق على الشارع الرئيس المؤدي الى مطار الخرطوم الدولي اسم شارع افريقيا.\nاما الميادين العامه فمن اشهرها ميدان عباس (سمي على اسم الخديو عباس) وتحول اسمه لاحقاً الى ميدان الامم المتحده ثم اقيمت في مساحته مكتبه القبه الخضراء واخيراً مول الواحه، وهناك ميدان عبد المنعم محمد (احد رجال الاعمال البارزين) تمت اعاده تسميته الى ميدان نادي الاسره.\nولعل من ابرز ساحات وميادين الخرطوم العامه ميدان ابو جنزير وسمي على اسم الشيخ ابو جنزير (وهو احد شيوخ الصوفيه في الخرطوم كان يدير خلوه لتدريس القران في هذا المكان حتى توفي ودفن فيه واقيم عليه ضريحاً له كان موجودا حتى وقت فريب تحيط به سلسله من الحلقات الحديديه الصنع)، كذلك يوجد في الخرطوم ميدان جاكسون بمنطقه الخرطوم غرب والذي لم يكن معروفاً بشكل واسع قبل ان يتم مؤخراً تحويل موقف حافلات الركاب العامه اليه من مواقفها بمنطقه وسط الخرطوم (وسمي الميدان والحي الذي يقع عليه بهذا الاسم نسبه الى جاكسون باشا مهندس المساحه الانجليزي ببلديه الخرطوم في عام 1920 م.\n\nمعالم الخرطوم\nالاقتصاد\nكتب ونستون تشرشل رئيس وزراء بريطانيا الاسبق، في كتابه حرب النهر، عن الخرطوم وقال «ان مدينه الخرطوم الواقعه عند التقاء النيلين الازرق والابيض، هي النقطه التي يجب ان تلتقي فيها التجاره حتماً مع الجنوب. وهي الصنبور الكبير الذي تمر من خلاله البضائع التي تم جمعها من منطقه واسعه وتنساب شمالا نحو ساحل البحر المتوسط. فهي معلم لاقصى حدود شمال السودان الخصب. وينساب النهر بين الخرطوم واسوان لمسافه 1 كيلومتر عبر الصحراء القاحله».\n\nلايزال اقتصاد الخرطوم يعتمد على التجاره واعاده توزيع البضائع والسلع وعلى قطاع الخدمات، خاصه الخدمات الماليه كالبنوك ومكاتب الصرافه والتامينات وغيرها.\nوكانت التجاره في فتره الحكم الثنائي حكراً على ثلاث شركات بريطانيه تهيمن على الصادر والوارد في السودان وهي: شركه متشل كوتس، وشركه سودان مركنتايل، وشركه جلاتلي هانكي وشركائهم، حيث يقوم التجار المحليون ببيع المحاصيل الزراعيه السودانيه من قطن وصمغ عربي وسمسم وفول سوداني لتلك الشركات التي تقوم بدورها تصدير السلع السودانيه للخارج واستيراد سلع وبضائع اجنبيه وبيعها لتجار الجمله المحليين.\nيتنوع النشاط الاقتصادي الحالي في المدينه من زراعي الى صناعي وسياحي، ويتركز بصفه اساسيه على قطاع الخدمات حيث نجد مجموعه كبيره من السكان تعمل في دواوين الدوله وشركات وبنوك القطاع الخاص، كما ان هناك شريحه كبيره من اصحاب رؤوس الاموال تمارس التجاره، اما سكان المناطق الريفيه المحيطه بالمدينه وبعض القاطنين علي ضفاف النيل فيعملون بالزراعه والرعي ويمدون العاصمه بالخضر والفاكهه والالبان واللحوم والاسماك، ومنهم من يمارس صناعه الفخار والطوب.\n\nالمصارف والنشاط المالي\nتقع معظم المقار الرئيسيه للبنوك التجاريه في الخرطوم

الديمغرافيه للخرطوم بان حوالي 61 في المائه من السكان\nتتراوح اعمارهم بين 15-64 عاما مما يدل على ان منطقه الخرطوم الكبرى تستقطب المجموعات السكانيه الاكثر انتاجيه وتعتبر ام درمان الجزء الاكثر اكتظاظا بالسكان\nبنسبه|نسبه تقدر بحوالي 43.5 في المائه من مجموع سكان العاصمه المثلثه، ولكنها الاقل نسبه من حيث عدد الافراد في كل اسره (6.1) فرد في حين ان الرقم هو (6.5) في الخرطوم بحري، و (6.4) في الخرطوم.

بنسبه تبلغ 88.6 في المائه، مقابل 11.2 في المائه للمسيحيين الذين ازدادت اعدادهم في العقود الاخيره بشكل ملحوظ نتيجه لتوافد اعداد كبيره من النازحين واللاجئين\nمن جنوب السودان وجبال النوبه ومن اثيوبيا

ومشاكل طبيعيه اخرى تتمثل في الفيضانات والاتربه والزحف الصحراوي ونحت التربه في ضفاف النيل.\nوتتمثل المشاكل الاجتماعيه في ظاهره التشرد واطفال الشوارع، نتيجه موجات اللاجئين التي شهدتها المدينه بسبب الحروب والقتال في الداخل وفي البلدان المجاوره والهجره من الريف الى المدينه وما نتج عن ذلك من انتشار السكن العشوائي في الاطراف الهامشيه للمدينه والباعه المتجولين في اسواقها.\n\nمعرض صور\nلمزيد من

          "content": "Kassala (Arabic: كسلا, Tigrinya: ከሰላ) is the capital of the state of Kassala in eastern Sudan.  In 2003 its population was recorded to be 530,950. Built on the banks of the Gash River, it is a market city and is famous for its fruit gardens. Many of its inhabitants are from the Hadendawa sub-tribe of the Beja ethnic group.\nThe city was formerly a railroad hub, however, as of 2006 there was no operational railway station in Kassala and much of the track leading to and from the city has been salvaged or fallen into disrepair. Kassala's location along the main Khartoum-Port Sudan highway makes it an important trade center.\n\nHistory\nIn 1834, the Egyptian Army established Kassala as a garrison town following its conquest of Sudan in 1821. When the Mahdist state was established, the Egyptian garrison in Kassala found itself besieged by Mahdist forces. Under the terms of the 1884 Hewett Treaty, Abyssinian forces led by Ras Alula attempted to rescue the Egyptians. Although Ras Alula successfully defeated the Mahdists at the Battle of Kufit, he was unable to breach Kassala’s defenses and liberate the Egyptians. In 1886, after prolonged resistance, the Egyptian garrison finally surrendered to the Mahdists under Osman Digna.\nOn July 17, 1894, Italy annexed Kassala to Italian Eritrea. The Italians fortified the town and brought stability to the region by pacifying the Beja, the dominant local population. However, Italy's defeat at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 changed Kassala's fate. Italy was forced to evacuate the town after failing to hold it until the arrival of advancing Anglo-Egyptian forces, who re-occupied Kassala and incorporated it into Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.\nIn the early 1900s, a railway was constructed, first linking Kassala to the Red Sea port of Port Sudan—built in 1906 to replace Suakin—and later, in 1929, extending to Sennar on the southern frontiers of the Gezira Cotton Scheme. When the Anglo-Egyptian forces re-established control over Sudan, Kassala developed into a thriving trade center serving the Ethiopian hinterlands. Horticulture was introduced in the fertile lands near the Gash and Barka rivers, and the British later introduced cotton cultivation. The Kassala Cotton Company, a subsidiary of the Sudan Plantations Syndicate, played a role in these developments.\nIn July 1940, during the East African Campaign, Italian forces advancing from Italian East Africa forced the local British garrison to withdraw from Kassala. The Italians then occupied the city with brigade-sized units: on July 4, 1940 the Italians started their offensive with 2,500 men (and one brigade of cavalry) supported by 24 tanks, while to defend Kassala for Britain there were 1,300 colonial soldiers with their British officers who -after some initial heavy fighting- were easily defeated. The Italians later appointed as mayor of Kassala the future hero of Eritrean independence, Hamid Idris Awate. In mid-January 1941, the Italians withdrew from the city and a British garrison returned.\nIn 2003, Kassala's population was estimated at 530,950 inhabitants. The town is ethnically diverse, comprising groups such as the Beja, Beni-Amer, Amarar, Bishari, Rashaida, and Halanga, as well as significant immigrant communities from northern and western Sudan, including the Fula and Nuba peoples.  The Ethiopian-Eritrean War (1998–2000) displaced an estimated 110,000 Eritreans refugees to the Kassala area, particularly from the border towns of Barentu and Teseney, which were overrun by the Ethiopian Army.\nIn 2025, during the Sudanese civil war (2023-present), Kassala had been involved in conflict for the first time since the war began 2 years ago. The RSF attacked Kassala with drones on 3 May 2025. The attack targeted the fuel storage area at the Kassala Airport. This attack marks the second furthest drone attack by the RSF from controlled areas by the RSF. RSF later attacked Port Sudan.\n\nClimate\nKassala has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) characterized by high temperatures, low precipitation, and abundant sunshine. April through June marks the hottest period of the year, followed by the wet season from July through September, marked by higher humidity levels and intermittent rainfall. The rest of the year is very dry, with nearly no precipitation from November to March.\n\nCurrent status\nThe Kassala region had a child mortality rate of 62 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2014, slightly higher than the national average of 52 child deaths per 1,000.\nThe Khatmiyya Mosque, built in 1840 by the Egyptians and damaged during the Mahdist War, is the city's most important cultural site.  It is an important site for the Sufi Khatmiyya order.\n\nEducation\nThe city is home to Kassala University, a public university established in 1990 to replace the East University, and an important institution for development in the east of Sudan.\nIncluding Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Faculty of Education,Faculty of Economic and Administration, Faculty of Computer science and IT and more.\n\nNotable people\nBushara Abdel-Nadief (footballer)\nAisha Musa Ahmad (singer)\nHassan Al-Turabi (politician)\nMuhannad El Tahir (footballer)\nNizar Hamid (footballer)\nNoor Uthman Muhammed\n\nSee also\n2007 Sudan floods\nRailway stations in Sudan\nToteil\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nKassala program, Ockenden International",

          "content": "Port Sudan (Arabic: بور سودان, romanized: Būr Sūdān, Beja: Bar'uut) is a major port city on the Red Sea in eastern Sudan, and the capital of Red Sea State. Port Sudan is Sudan's main seaport and the source of 90% of the country's international trade. The population of Port Sudan was estimated in the 2008 Census of Sudan to be 394,561 people.\nPort Sudan has historically been a centre for commercial activity, particularly in the shipping industry. \nDue to the civil war in the country that started in 2023, the Sudanese government has largely been operating from Port Sudan as a result of intense fighting in the capital city Khartoum from April 2023 to May 2025, leading to it being described as a de facto capital of the country. Port Sudan also has emerged as a refuge for internally displaced persons in Sudan.\n\nHistory\nFounding and early history\nPort Sudan was built between 1905 and 1909 by the administration of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to replace Suakin—the historic, coral-choked Arab port. An oil pipeline was built between the port and Khartoum in 1977.\n\nEarly 21st century\nIn 2009, Israel allegedly used naval commandos to attack Iranian arms ships at Port Sudan as part of Operation Birds of Prey. In 2020, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced that the Russian Navy would begin construction on a base with capacity for 300 personnel and four warships in Port Sudan. The facility would provide Russia with a naval base in the nation for at least 25 years. The plan was ultimately suspended, though Sudanese leadership has indicated that it is possible for the construction to go ahead in the future.\nIn 2016, it was reported that residents of Port Sudan face water scarcity. Following the October–November 2021 Sudanese coup d'état, the Beja tribal council initiated a weeklong blockade of the city's ports. Following negotiations with military officials, the blockade was lifted.\n\nSudanese civil war (2023–present)\nDuring the Sudanese civil war (2023–present), Port Sudan has emerged as a leading destination and refuge for internally displaced persons fleeing war in other parts of the country. Internally-displaced refugees in the city reportedly face extreme heat and shortages of food and water.\nBy late October 2023, Reuters reported that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) controlled most of Khartoum, causing the government led by Abdul Fattah el-Burhan to have largely relocated to Port Sudan. General Abdul Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces, \"has threatened to establish a cabinet\" in Port Sudan, \"with the intention of creating an alternative or second capital.\" Hemedti, leader of the RSF, in turn, warned that this would lead to him declaring his own rival government based in Khartoum or another city he controlled. Analysts have raised concerns of a lasting split similar to that of Libya during its civil wars. Port Sudan has been described as becoming a \"de facto\" capital of Sudan.\nIran and Russia have been trying to negotiate with Sudan to build a naval base in the city.\nOn 4 May 2025, the RSF launched a drone attack on Port Sudan for the first time since the beginning of the war, targeting the Osman Digna Air Base, \"a goods warehouse and some civilian facilities\" and causing \"limited damage\". A day later, another RSF drone attack occurred targeting fuel depots, leading to a fire. Some Arab nations condemned the actions.\n\nEconomy\nThe city has an oil refinery and handles 90% of the country's international trade. Major exports include oilseed, senna, and hides and skins. Imports include construction materials, heavy machinery, and vehicles.\n\nTransport\nThe city has a modern container port to handle imports and exports. The port is part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe.\nThe main airport is Port Sudan New International Airport. There is now a tarred road linking Port Sudan to Khartoum via Atbara. Port Sudan also has a 1067mm gauge rail link with Khartoum. There is also an international ferry from Jeddah.\nIn 2023 a new seaport was proposed about 200km north of Port Sudan at Abu Amama. A 450km road to the farming hub at Abu Hamad would also be provided. This new seaport is opposite Jeddah which shortens the ferry trip from Jeddah.\n\nEducation\nThe city is home to the Red Sea University, established in 1994.\n\nPlaces of worship\nPlaces of worship are predominantly Muslim mosques, but there are also Christian churches and temples including the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Khartoum (Catholic Church), Sudan Interior Church (Baptist World Alliance), and Presbyterian Church in Sudan (World Communion of Reformed Churches) and Coptic Orthodox Churches.\n\nClimate\nPort Sudan has a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh) with extremely hot summers and moderately hot winters, requiring the acquisition of fresh water from Wadi Arba'at in the Red Sea Hills and from salt-evaporating pans. Temperatures can easily exceed 30 °C (86 °F) in winter and 45 °C (113 °F) in summer. Over 90% of the annual rainfall falls between October and January, mostly in November, with the wettest month on record being November 1947 with 182 millimetres (7.2 in), whilst the wettest year was from July 1923 to June 1924 with 231 millimetres (9.1 in). Average annual rainfall is 76 millimetres (3.0 in), and no rainfall occurred between January 1983 and June 1984. The  mean temperature year round (the average of all daily highs and nighttime lows) is 28.4 °C (83.1 °F).\n\nDemographics\nThe population consists mainly of Sudanese Arabs, including the native Beja people, with small Asian and European minorities.\n\nSport\nHay Al-Arab SC founded in 1928, and \tHilal Alsahil SC founded in 1937, both play at the Port Sudan Stadium in the football\tSudan Premier League. The city's third team is Al-Merreikh Al-Thagher.\n\nNotable people\nGawaher (Pop singer)\nRa'ouf Mus'ad (Playwright)\n\nSee also\nSuakin\n\nNotes\nReferences\nArckell, A.

          "summary": "Port Sudan (Arabic: بور سودان, romanized: Būr Sūdān, Beja: Bar'uut) is a major port city on the Red Sea in eastern Sudan, and the capital of Red Sea State. Port Sudan is Sudan's main seaport and the source of 90% of the country's international trade. The population of Port Sudan was estimated in the 2008 Census of Sudan to be 394,561 people.\nPort Sudan has historically been a centre for commercial activity, particularly in the shipping industry. \nDue to the civil war in the country that started in 2023, the Sudanese government has largely been operating from Port Sudan as a result of intense fighting in the capital city Khartoum from April 2023 to May 2025, leading to it being described as a de facto capital of the country. Port Sudan also has emerged as a refuge for internally displaced persons in Sudan.",
