      "content": "Hegra (Ancient Greek: Ἕγρα, Arabic: ٱلْحِجْر‎, romanized: al-Ḥijr), also known as Madaʾin Salih (Arabic: مَدَائِن صَالِح‎, romanized: Madāʾin Ṣāliḥ, lit. 'Cities of Salih'), is an archaeological site located in the area of Al-'Ula within Medina Province in the Hejaz region, Saudi Arabia. \nA majority of the remains date from the Nabataean Kingdom (1st century AD). The site constituted the kingdom's southernmost and second largest city after Petra (modern-day Jordan), its capital city. Traces of Lihyanite and Roman occupation before and after the Nabataean rule, respectively, can also be found. The site features more than 110 well-preserved Nabataean tombs carved into sandstone outcrops.\nThe archaeological site lies in an arid environment. The dry climate, the lack of resettlement after the site was abandoned, and the prevailing local beliefs about the locality have all led to the extraordinary state of preservation of Al-Hijr, providing an extensive picture of the Nabataean lifestyle. Thought to mark the southern extent of the Nabataean kingdom, Al-Hijr's oasis agriculture and extant wells exhibit the necessary adaptations made by the Nabataeans in the given environment—its markedly distinct settlement is the second largest among the Nabataean kingdom, complementing that of the more famous Petra archaeological site in Jordan. The location of the site at the crossroads of trade, and the various languages, scripts and artistic styles reflected in the façades of its monumental tombs further set it apart from other archaeological sites. It has duly earned the nickname \"The Capital of Monuments\" among Saudi Arabia's 4,000 archaeological sites.\nThe Quran places the settlement of the area by the Thamudi people during the days of the prophet Salih, between those of Nuh (Noah) and Hud on one hand, and those of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses) on the other. However, a definitive historical chronology can not be obtained through the order of verses because the Quranic chapters (see surah) deal with different subjects in non-chronologic order. According to the Quran, the Thamudis were punished by God for their idolatry, struck by an earthquake and lightning blasts. Thus, the site has earned a reputation as a cursed place—an image which the national government is attempting to overcome as it seeks to develop Mada'in Salih for its potential for tourism.\nIn 2008, UNESCO proclaimed Mada'in Salih as a site of patrimony, becoming Saudi Arabia's first World Heritage Site. It was chosen for its well-preserved remains from late antiquity, especially the 131 monumental rock-cut tombs, with their elaborately ornamented façades, of the Nabataean Kingdom.\n\nLocation\nThe archaeological site of Hegra is situated 20 km (12 mi) north of the town of Al-'Ula, 400 km (250 miles) northwest of Medina, and 500 km (310 miles) southeast of Petra, Jordan. Istakhri wrote in his Routes of the Realms (مسالك الممالك‎):\n\nAl-Hijr is a small village. It belongs to Wadi al Gura and is located at one day's travel inside the mountains. It was the homeland of the Thamudians. I have seen those mountains and their carvings. Their houses are similar to ours but are carved in the mountains, which are called the Ithlib mountains. It looks as if they are a continuous range but they are separated and have sand dunes around them. You can reach the top of the mountains, but this is extremely tiring. The well of the Thamudians which is mentioned in the Holy Quran is located in the middle of the mountains.\nThe site is on a plain at the foot of a basalt plateau that forms a portion of the Hijaz Mountains. Beneath the western and northwestern parts of the site, the water table can be reached at a depth of 20 metres (66 ft). The setting is notable for its desert landscape, marked by sandstone outcroppings of various sizes and heights.\n\nHistory\nName\nIts long history and the multitude of cultures occupying the site have produced several names. References by Strabo and other Mediterranean writers use the name Hegra (Ancient Greek: Ἔγρα) for the Nabataean site. The use of Mada'in Salih refers to the (Prophet) Salih, sent to ancient Arabs, a name and identity which may be derived from the biblical figure Methuselah (Hebrew: מְתוּשֶׁלַח‎, romanized: Məṯūšélaḥ, in pausa מְתוּשָׁלַח‎ Məṯūšālaḥ \"Man of the javelin\" or \"Death of Sword\"; Greek: Μαθουσάλας, romanized: Mathousálas).\n\nAlthough Hegra was for a long time not as important as Dedan, foreigners appear to have called the oasis Hegra. For example, the famous statue of the Achaemenid king Darius the Great made in Egypt and erected in Susa calls the Arabs hgr.\n\nRock writings\nRecent archaeological work has revealed numerous rock writings and pictures not only on Mount Athleb, but also throughout central Arabia. They date between the sixth century BC and the fourth century AD and are labelled as being Thamudic, a name invented by nineteenth-century scholars for these large numbers of inscriptions which had not yet been properly studied.\n\nLihyan/Dedanite era\nArchaeological traces of cave art on the sandstones and epigraphs (inscriptions), considered by experts to be Lihyanite script, on top of the Athleb Mountain, near Hegra (Madaʾin Salih), have been dated to the 3rd–2nd century BC, indicating the early human settlement of the area, which has an accessible source of freshwater and fertile soil. The settlement of the Lihyans became a centre of commerce, with goods from the east, north and south converging in the locality.\n\nNabataean era\nThe extensive settlement of the site took place during the 1st century AD, when it came under the rule of the Nabataean king Aretas IV Philopatris (Al-Harith IV) (9 BC – 40 AD), who made Hegra (Madaʾin Salih) the kingdom's second capital, after Petra in the north. The place enjoyed a huge urbanization movement, turning it into a city. Characteristic of Nabateaan rock-cut architecture, the geology of Hegra (Madaʾin Salih) provided the perfect medium for the carving of monumental structures, with Nabataean scripts inscribed on their façades. \nThe Nabataeans also developed oasis agriculture—digging wells and rainwater tanks in the rock and carving places of worship in the sandstone outcroppings. Similar structures were featured in other Nabataean settlements, ranging from southern Syria (region) to the north, going south to the Negev, and down to the immediate area of the Hejaz. The most prominent and the largest of these is Petra.\nAt the crossroad of commerce, the Nabataean kingdom flourished, holding a monopoly for the trade of incense, myrrh and spices. Situated on the overland caravan route and connected to the Red Sea port of Egra Kome, Hegra, as it was known among the Nabataeans, reached its peak as the major staging post on the main north–south trade route.\n\nRoman era\nIn 106 AD, the Nabataean kingdom was annexed by the contemporary Roman Empire. The Hejaz, which encompasses Hegra, became part of the Roman province of Arabia.\n\nThe Hedjaz region was integrated into the Roman province of Arabia in 106 AD. A monumental Roman epigraph of 175–177 AD was recently discovered at al-Hijr (then called \"Hijr\" and now Mada'in Salih).\n\nThe trading itinerary shifted from the overland north–south axis on the Arabian Peninsula to the maritime route through the Red Sea. Thus, Hegra as a centre of trade began to decline, leading to its abandonment. Supported by the lack of later developments based on archaeological studies, experts have hypothesized that the site had lost all of its urban functions beginning in late antiquity (mainly due to the process of desertification). In the 1960s and 1970s, evidence was discovered that the Roman legions of Trajan occupied Mada'in Salih in northeastern Arabia, increasing the extension of the Arabia Petraea province of the Romans in Arabia.\nThe history of Hegra during the period from the decline of the Roman Empire until the emergence of Islam remains unknown. It was only sporadically mentioned by travellers and pilgrims making their way to Mecca in the succeeding centuries. Hegra served as a station along the Hajj route, providing supplies and water for pilgrims. Among the accounts is a description made by 14th-century traveller Ibn Battuta, noting the red stone-cut tombs of Hegra, by then known as \"al-Hijr\". However, he made no mention of human activities there.\n\nOttoman era\nThe Ottoman Empire annexed western Arabia from the Mamluks by 1517. In early Ottoman accounts of the Hajj road between Damascus and Mecca, Hegra (Madaʾin Salih) is not mentioned, until 1672, when the Turkish traveller, Evliya Celebi noted that the caravan passed through a place called \"Abyar Salih\" where there were the remains of seven cities. It is again mentioned by the traveller Murtada ibn 'Alawan as a rest stop on the route called \"al-Mada'in\". Between 1744 and 1757, a fort was built at al-Hijr on the orders of the Ottoman governor of Damascus, As'ad Pasha al-Azm. A cistern supplied by a large well within the fort was also built, and the site served as a one-day stop for Hajj pilgrims where they could purchase goods such as dates, lemons and oranges. It was part of a series of fortifications built to protect the pilgrimage route to Mecca.\nAccording to the researches of Al-Ansari, the Ottoman castle was found near the settlement dating to the year 1600 AD in 1984.\n\n19th century\nIn 1812, Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered Petra for the Western world. In the aftermath of the news making the rounds, Charles Montagu Doughty, an English traveller, heard of a similar site near Hegra (Madaʾin Salih), a fortified Ottoman town on the Hajj road from Damascus. To access the site, Doughty joined the Hajj caravan, and reached the site of the ruins in 1876, recording the visit in his journal which was published as Travels in Arabia Deserta. Doughty described the Ottoman fort, where he resided for two months, and noted that Bedouin tribesmen had a permanent encampment just outside of the building.\nIn the 19th century, there were accounts that the extant wells and oasis agriculture of al-Hijr were being periodically used by settlers from the nearby village of Tayma. This continued until the 20th century, when the Hejaz Railway that passed through the site was constructed (1901–08) on the orders of Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II to link Damascus and Jerusalem in the north-west with Medina and Mecca, hence facilitating the pilgrimage journey to the latter and to politically and economically consolidate the Ottoman administration of the centres of Islamic faith. A station was built north of al-Hijr for the maintenance of locomotives, and offices and dormitories for railroad staff. The railway provided greater accessibility to the site. However, this was destroyed in a local revolt during World War I. Despite this, several archaeological investigations continued to be conducted in the site beginning in the World War I period to the establishment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the 1930s up to the 1960s. The former railway station, restored and redeveloped, has been transformed into the Chedi Hegra Resort, opened in 2024. The project incorporates the historic station within the hotel complex, designed by the Milan-based architecture firm Giò Forma in collaboration with Black Engineering, and operated by General Hotel Management Ltd. (GHM) under its luxury brand The Chedi.\nBy the end of the 1960s, the Saudi Arabian government devised a program to introduce a sedentary lifestyle to the nomadic Bedouin tribes inhabiting the area. It was proposed that they settle down in al-Hijr, re-using the already existent wells and agricultural features of the site. However, the official identification of al-Hijr as an archaeological site in 1972 led to the resettlement of the Bedouins towards the north, beyond the site boundary. This also included the development of new agricultural land and freshly dug wells, thereby preserving the state of al-Hijr.\n\nRecent developments\nIn 1962, examples of many inscriptions were discovered and renewed the archaeological assessment of Hijr (Madaʾin Salih) by Winnett and Reed. Although the Al-Hijr site was proclaimed as an archaeological treasure in the early 1970s, few investigations had been conducted since. Mirdad had lived here for a short time and wrote notices about the region since 1977. Healey studied here in 1985 and wrote a book about the inscriptions of Hijr (Madaʾin Salih) in 1993.\nThe prohibition on the veneration of objects/artifacts has resulted in minimal archaeological activities. These conservative measures started to ease up beginning in 2000, when Saudi Arabia invited expeditions to carry out archaeological explorations as part of the government's push to promote cultural heritage protection and tourism. The archaeological site was proclaimed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008. More recent archaeological studies of the area have been made as part of efforts to document and preserve the heritage sites prior to opening the area to more tourism.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Nabataean site of Hegra was built around a residential zone and its oasis during the 1st century CE. The sandstone outcroppings were carved to build the necropolis. A total of four necropolis sites have survived, which featured 131 monumental rock-cut tombs spread out over 13.4 km (8.3 miles), many with inscribed Nabataean epigraphs on their façades:\n\nNon-monumental burial sites, totaling 2,000, are also part of the place. A closer observation of the façades indicates the social status of the buried person—the size and ornamentation of the structure reflect the wealth of the person. Some façades had plates on top of the entrances providing information about the grave owners, the religious system, and the masons who carved them. Many graves indicate military ranks, leading archaeologists to speculate that the site might once have been a Nabataean military base, meant to protect the settlement's trading activities.\nThe Nabataean kingdom was not just situated at the crossroad of trade but also of culture. This is reflected in the varying motifs of the façade decorations, borrowing stylistic elements from Assyria, Phoenicia, Egypt and Hellenistic Alexandria, combined with the native artistic style. Roman decorations and Latin scripts also figured on the troglodytic tombs when the territory was annexed by the Roman Empire. In contrast to the elaborate exteriors, the interiors of the rock-cut structures are severe and plain.\nA religious area, known as \"Jabal Ithlib,\" is located to the north-east of the site. It is believed to have been originally dedicated to the Nabataean deity Dushara. A narrow corridor, 40 metres (131 ft) long between the high rocks and reminiscent of the Siq in Petra, leads to the hall of the Diwan, a Muslim's council-chamber or law-court. Small religious sanctuaries bearing inscriptions were also cut into the rock in the vicinity.\nThe residential area is located in the middle of the plain, far from the outcrops. The primary material of construction for the houses and the enclosing wall was sun-dried mudbrick. Few vestiges of the residential area remain.\nWater is supplied by 130 wells, situated in the western and north-western part of the site, where the water table was at a depth of only 20 m (66 ft). The wells, with diameters ranging 4–7 m (13–23 ft), were cut into the rock, although some, dug in loose ground, had to be reinforced with sandstone.\n\nIn the Qur'an\nAccording to the Quran, the site of al-Hijr was settled by the tribe of Thamud, who \"(took) for (themselves) palaces from its plains and (carved) from the mountains, homes\".[Quran 7:73–79][Quran 11:61–69][Quran 15:80–84] The tribe fell to idol worship, and oppression became prevalent. The prophet Salih, to whom the site's name of Mada'in Salih is often attributed, called on the Thamudis to repent. The Thamudis disregarded the warning and instead commanded Salih to summon a pregnant she-camel from the back of a mountain. And so a pregnant she-camel was sent to the people from the back of the mountain, as proof of Salih's divine mission.\nHowever, only a minority heeded his words. The non-believers killed the sacred camel instead of caring for it as they were told, and its calf ran back to the mountain from whence it came. The Thamudis were given three days before their punishment was to take place, since they disbelieved and did not heed the warning. Salih and his monotheistic followers left the city, but the others were punished by God—their souls leaving their lifeless bodies in the midst of an earthquake and lightning blasts.\nRobert G. Hoyland suggested that their name was subsequently adopted by other new groups that inhabited the region of Mada'in Salih after the disappearance of the original people of Thamud. This suggestion is also supported by the narration of ʿAbdullah ibn ʿUmar and analysis of Ibn Kathir which report that people called the region of Thamud al-Hijr, while they called the province of Mada'in Salih as Arḍ Thamūd \"Land of Thamud\" and Bayt Thamud (house of Thamud). So the term \"Thamud\" was not applied to the groups that lived in Mada'in Salih, such as Lihyanites and Nabataeans, but rather to the region itself, and according to classical sources, it was agreed upon that the only remaining group of the native people of Thamud is the tribe of Banu Thaqif which inhabited the city of Taif south of Mecca.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of World Heritage Sites in Saudi Arabia\nIram of the Pillars\nLeuke Kome\nLihyan\nNabataeans\nList of colossal sculptures in situ\nAncient towns in Saudi Arabia\n\nFootnotes\nFurther reading\nAbdul Rahman Ansary; Ḥusayn Abu Al-Ḥassān (2001).

      "content": "مَدَائِن صَالِح كانت تعرف قديماً بـ الحِجْر، هي موقع اثري يقع في اقليم الحجاز في شبه الجزيره العربيه، شمال غرب المملكه العربيه السعوديه وتحديداً في محافظه العُلا التابعه لمنطقه المدينه المنوره. يحتل المكان موقعاً استراتيجياً على الطريق الذي يربط جنوب شبه الجزيره العربيه ببلاد الرافدين وبلاد الشام ومصر، كما ان للمكان شهرته التاريخيه التي استمدّها من موقعه على طريق التجاره القديم الذي يربط جنوب شبه الجزيره العربيه والشام، والحجر اسم ديار ثمود بوادي القرى بين المدينه المنوره وتبوك. ورد ذكر الحجر في القران على انها موطن قوم ثمود، الذين استجابوا لدعوه نبي الله صالح، ثم ارتدُّوا عن دينهم وعقروا الناقه التي ارسلها الله لهم ايه فاهلكهم بالصيحه.\nتعد مدائن صالح من اهم حواضر الانباط بعد عاصمتهم البتراء، اذ تحتوي على اكبر مستوطنه جنوبيه لمملكه الانباط بعد البتراء في الاردن، والتي تفصلها عنها مسافه 500 كم، ويعود ابرز ادوارها الحضاريه الى القرنين الاول قبل الميلاد والاول الميلادي، وذلك خلال فتره ازدهار الدوله النبطيه وقبل سقوطها على يد الامبراطوريه الرومانيه عام 106م، ويُعتقد ان الحِجْر استمرت في حضارتها حتى القرن الرابع الميلادي، وكانت عاصمه مملكه لحيان في شمال شبه الجزيره العربيه.\nتضم اثار مدائن صالح 153 واجهه صخريه منحوته، كما تضم عدداً من الاثار الاسلاميه والتي تتمثل في عدد من القلاع وبقايا خط سكه حديد الحجاز والتي تمتد لمسافه 13 كم وكذلك المحطه والقاطرات. في سنه 2008م تم تسجيل الموقع ضمن قائمه مواقع التراث العالمي، ليصبح بذلك اول موقع يتم تسجيله في السعوديه.\nكما يوجد موقع اثري اخر يعرف بمدائن شعيب يقع شمال غرب مدائن صالح ويتبع منطقه تبوك، حيث يحتوي الموقع على اثار تشبه الى حد كبير تلك الموجوده في مدائن صالح.\n\nالتاريخ\nمملكه دادان\nهي مملكه تابعه لمملكه معين من القرن الخامس ق.م حتى بدايات الاول ق.م، قامت في الحِجْر والاجزاء الشماليه الغربيه من شبه الجزيره العربيه، واغلب الظن انها مرحله سابقه لمملكه لحيان حيث يعتقد بعض الباحثين ان اللحيانيين كانوا من سكان العربيه الجنوبيه، لورود نص يشير الى قيل لحياني في اليمن اسمه «اب يدع ذو لحيان» واستوطنوا دادان جنوب اراضي لحيان، فلما ضعفت حكومه المعينيين في اليمن استولى اللحيانيون على المملكه واسموها على اسم قبيلتهم، وليس بين الباحثين اتفاق على اصولهم تحديداً، ويرى جواد علي ان المعينيين كوَّنوا مستعمرات في اعالي الحجاز منذ القرن الخامس قبل الميلاد ووصفهم باللحيانيين ايام قوه المعينيين، وهدف هذه المستعمرات هو تامين الطريق التجاريه من اليمن الى الشام. ووفقاً لورنر كاسكل: \n\n اغلب بضاعتهم القادمه من جنوب شبه الجزيره العربيه كانت موجهه لمصر واليونان ويعتقد كاسكل ان اللحيانيين استولوا عليها في منتصف القرن الثاني ق.م قرابه 150 ق.م فقد كان المعينيون يسيطرون على الحِجْر واعالي الحجاز من القرن الخامس ق.م بمساعده من اللحيانيين بدلاله ان اول ملوكهم كان معينياً ثم عادت للحيان مستغلين ضعف مملكه معين وحروبها مع مملكه سبا. يرى جواد علي ان اللحيانيين ينحدرون من النبي اسماعيل، وقد عدهم بلينيوس الاكبر في جمله الشعوب العربيه كذلك.\n\nاللحيانيون\nيختلف المؤرخون في اصل اللحيانيين، فمنهم من يرى انهم فرع من ثمود، بينما يرى اخرون انهم احد الشعوب العربيه الجنوبيه، بدليل انه قد ورد اسم لحيان في نص عربي جنوبي. كانت العلا مركزاً للحيانيين، حيث كانت مستعمره معينيه قديمه، كما انها القاعده الشماليه القصوى للحضاره العربيه الجنوبيه، تقع في وادي القرى جنوب شرق حره العويرض بين سلسله من الجبال في الشرق والغرب، وعلى بُعد حوالي 15 كم الى الجنوب من مدائن صالح، هناك موقع كان يُسمّى قديماً «ددان» او «ديدان» بحسب ما جاء في كتب الانساب اليهوديه وفي النصوص المعينيه، ولاحقاً سُمّي بوادي القرى ويُعرف الان بالعُلا، وقد اختلف الباحثون فيمن حكم هذه المنطقه اولاً وكان الاختلاف بين الديدانيين والمعينيين واللحيانيين.\nامتد نفوذ دوله لحيان على الارض الممتده غربي النفود، من شمال يثرب الى ما يحاذي خليج العقبه.\nوقد اختلف في فتره دوله لحيان، يرى البعض انها كانت بين بدايه القرن الخامس ونهايه القرن الثالث قبل الميلاد، ويرى اخرون الى انها انما كانت فيما بين القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد (حوالي سنه 160 ق. م) وبين نهايه القرن الثالث بعد الميلاد، وهناك من حدد الفتره ما بين عامي 280 - 200 قبل الميلاد لقيامها،\nوان نهايتها كانت على ايدي الانباط الذين استولوا على «الحِجْر» سنه 65 ق. م، و«ديدان» سنه 9 ق. م،\nوان هناك من يرى ان نهايه دوله لحيان انما كانت على ايدي المعينيين، وان ذلك كان بين نهايه القرن الثالث والقرن الاول قبل الميلاد.\nعُثِر في العُلا بالقرب من مدائن صالح على ما يقارب من اربعمائه نقش لحياني اغلبها عباره عن نقوش وقطع صغيره، ومنها ما يحتوي على بعض اسماء الملوك والمعبودات الوثنيه، اما بالنسبه للكتابه اللحيانيه، فهي كتابه محليه حروفها ساميه جنوبيه وقريبه جداً من الكتابه العربيه الجنوبيه والحبشيه، اما اللهجه فعربيه شماليه وهي ايضاً ساميه جنوبيه. يرى البعض انها كانت مسيحيه، بينما يرجّح اخرون انها عربيه جاهليه وضعت قبل ظهور الاسلام.\nتحتوي هذه النقوش والكتابات على بعض اسماء ملوك لحيان، منها «هنوس بن شهر» و«ذو اسفعين تخمى بن لوذان» الذي يرجع حكمه الى النصف الاول من القرن الاول قبل الميلاد. كما ان هناك معبد يقع في العُلا يعود للحيانيين، وُجِدت فيه تماثيل بطول الانسان لملوك لحيان، وهذه التماثيل متاثره بالنحت الفرعوني في النصف الاعلى من الجسم، ومن حيث اللبس، ولكنها تحمل الطابع العربي المتمثل في شكل الوجه، وما وضع على الراس بما يشبه العمامه والعقال.\nيرى البعض ان الانباط قد استولوا على الحِجْر سنه 65 ق. م، الى ان وصلوا الى تيماء، ثم قطعوا كل اتصال للحيانيين بالبحر، فاستولوا على ميناء «لوكي كومه» التابع للحيانيين، واحاطوا بهم من جميع الجهات، ويُعتقد ان الطريق التجاري قد تغير اتجاهه بفعل النبطيين في جنوب الحجر، فكان يمر على مسافه 7 كم الى الشرق من واحه دادان القديمه، ثم اخضعوها لنفوذهم. عاد حكم اللحيانيين مره اخرى بعد سقوط البتراء على ايدي الرومان سنه 106م، والذين مدوا نفوذهم الى منطقه تبعد عشره كيلومترات الى الشمال من دادان.\n\nالانباط\nاستوطن النبط (الانباط) الحِجْر، والانباط هم من العرب من شمال شبه الجزيره العربيه. في القرن الاول قبل الميلاد، في فتره حكم الحارث الرابع جعل من الحِجْر العاصمه الثانيه للانباط حيث كانت عاصمتهم الاولى هي البتراء في الشمال، وكان للانباط حضاره كبيره وشيدوا المقابر في الجبال واضافوا لها الكثير من جماليات البناء القديم، حيث تظهر خصائص العماره النبطيه مع الكتابات النبطيه المنقوشه في الصخور على الواجهات الخاصه بهم. كما طوّروا ايضاً زراعه الواحات، وحفر الابار وعمل خزانات لمياه الامطار في الصخور، بالاضافه الى نحت اماكن العباده في النتوءات الصخريه.\nهناك منشات ومستوطنات مشابهه لما تحتويه مدائن صالح في عدد من الاماكن مثل الشام والمنطقه المجاوره للحجاز، وابرز هذه المنشات ما وجِد في البتراء.\nاستمرت حضاره الانباط في الازدهار والتوسع في الحجر حتى تحكموا في طرق التجاره في العالم القديم، حيث احتكروا تجاره البخور والمر والتوابل، وكان طريق التجاره القديم ياتي من جنوب شبه الجزيره العربيه حتى يصل الى الحِجْر، ومن الحجر يتفرع الى طريقين، يذهب احدهما الى البتراء ومصر والشام، فيما يذهب الاخر الى تيماء ثم تدمر في العراق. كما كانت الحجر مركزاً رئيسياً لطرق القوافل القديمه وكانت تتحكم في طرق القوافل، وبلغ نفوذهم كما يذكر المؤرخون شرق شبه الجزيره العربيه وجنوبها، وعندما خشي الرومان على نفوذهم وعلى دولتهم من هذه المملكه الجديده قام الرومان بشن حرب كبيره على الانباط واستطاع الرومان هزيمتهم في الحجر سنه 106م، ولكنهم لم يستوطنوا الحجر بل عادوا الى الشام، وهكذا تدمرت حضاره الانباط في الحجر ولم يعد لهم اي ذكر، وظلت الحجر مهجوره زمناً طويلاً.\n\nفتره ما بعد الانباط\nفي سنه 106م تم ضم مملكه الانباط من قبل الامبراطوريه الرومانيه. وبالتالي اصبح جزء من الحجاز والذي يشمل الحجر تحت ادارتهم.\nمؤخراً تم اكتشاف نقش روماني في الحجر يعود الى 175 - 177م.\nتحول طريق التجاره من كونه مساراً بريّاً يصل بين شمال شبه الجزيره العربيه وجنوبها الى ان اصبح مساراً بحريّاً وذلك عبر البحر الاحمر، مما ادّى الى انخفاض اهميتها التجاريّه بعد ان كانت مركزاً للتجاره، الى ان تمّ التخلي عنها لاحقاً. هناك دراسات اثريه افترضت ان الموقع قد فقد وظائفه الحضريه في بدايات اواخر العصور القديمه، ويعود ذلك الى عمليه التصحر في المنطقه.\nمؤخراً تم اكتشاف ادله على ان الفيالق الرومانيه في عهد تراجان سيطرت على مدائن صالح، لزياده نفوذها في المقاطعه العربيه.\n\nيبقى تاريخ الحجر منذ انهيار الامبراطوريه الرومانيه حتى ظهور الاسلام غير معروف، في سنه 9 هـ الموافقه لسنه 630م مر عليها النبي محمد اثناء توجهه لغزوه تبوك. بعد ظهور الاسلام وانتشاره عادت الحركه الى الحجر، كما تم ذكرها في القرون اللاحقه من قِبَل المسافرين والحجاج في طريقهم الى مكه، حيث كانت الحجر تخدم كمحطه للاستراحه بها والتزوّد بالماء والطعام، وقد ذكرها العديد من الرحاله العرب كالمقدسي وياقوت الحموي وابراهيم بن شجاع، وابن بطوطه الذي اشار في القرن الرابع عشر الميلادي الى الصخور والاضرحه الموجوده فيها، ولكنّه لم يشر الى الانشطه البشريه هناك.\nتحت الحكم العثماني والذي بدا في القرن السادس عشر، تم بناء حصن فيها في الفتره ما بين 1744 - 1757م، والذي كان ذلك جزءاً لسلسله من التحصينات تم بناؤها من اجل حمايه طريق الحج الى مكه.\n\nالمدائن في القرن العشرين\nمنذ القرن التاسع عشر استُخدِمت الابار القائمه لزراعه المنطقه بشكل دوري من قبل المستوطنين في تيماء المجاوره لها، واستمر هذا حتى القرن العشرين، عندما تم بناء سكه حديد الحجاز (1901 - 1908م) التي كانت تمرّ من خلال الموقع بامرٍ من السلطان العثماني عبد الحميد الثاني، لربط دمشق والقدس في الشمال الغربي بالمدينه المنوره، لتسهيل رحله الحج، بالاضافه الى امور سياسيه واقتصاديه لتعزيز الاداره العثمانيه على مراكز العقيده الاسلاميه. بُنِيت محطه مدائن صالح شمال الحجر، وقد عملت على زياده امكانيه الوصول للموقع. لاحقاً تم تدمير السكه من قِبل الانجليز خلال الثوره العربيه اثناء الحرب العالميه الاولى.\nاستمرت عده دراسات اثريه في الموقع للفتره منذ بدايه الحرب العالميه الاولى الى توحيد المملكه العربيه السعوديه في 1932، الى ان وصلت الى الستينيات الميلاديه. لاحقاً تم ترميم محطه سكه الحديد، وتتكون من 16 مبنى موزعاً على خط السكه بطول 400 متر تقريباً، وتضم مباني للاداره والمخازن ومركزاً للشرطه ومركزاً صحياً واقامه للعاملين في المحطه واستراحات للزوار، كما تتضمن محطه لصيانه القاطرات وورشه للصيانه ومخازن الحطب والطاقه.\nبحلول نهايه فتره الستينيات الميلاديه عملت الحكومه السعوديه برنامجاً لتحسين اسلوب حياه قبائل البدو الرحل التي تقطن المنطقه. وكان البرنامج يقترح استقرارهم في المنطقه مع اعاده استخدام الابار الموجوده والاشتغال بالزراعه، ولكن مع اكتساب الموقع هويته الرسميه كموقع اثري سنه 1972 ادّى الى توطين البدو نحو الشمال خارج حدود الموقع، وشمل ذلك تطوير الاراضي الزراعيه الجديده والابار التي حفرت حديثاً، للحفاظ على المنطقه.\n\nالحِجْر في الاسلام\nقوم ثمود في القران\nالثموديون هم اول من سكن الحجر واول من نحت المنازل في الصخور وجاء بعدهم الانباط. جاء ذكر الحِجْر وقصه قوم ثمود في القران في اكثر من سوره، حيث يذكر ان الثموديين تميّزوا بالقوه وكانوا يتخذون من الجبال بيوتاً عن طريق النّحت، فقد ورد في القران ﴿وَثَمُودَ الَّذِينَ جَابُوا الصَّخْرَ بِالْوَادِ ۝٩﴾ [الفجر:9]، وارسل الله اليهم نبيّه صالح، حيث دعاهم الى عباده الله وترك عباده الاصنام ولكنهم لم يؤمنوا به، ومع استمرار دعوته لهم، طلبوا منه ان يخرج لهم ناقه من صخره كبيره لديهم، وانهم سوف يؤمنون اذا نفّذ هذا الامر، فدعا الله ان يُخرج الناقه واستجاب الله له.\n﴿وَاِلَىٰ ثَمُودَ اَخَاهُمْ صَالِحًا ۗ قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ اِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ ۖ قَدْ جَاءَتْكُم بَيِّنَهٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ ۖ هَٰذِهِ نَاقَهُ اللَّهِ لَكُمْ ايَهً ۖ فَذَرُوهَا تَاْكُلْ فِي اَرْضِ اللَّهِ ۖ وَلَا تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوءٍ فَيَاْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابٌ اَلِيمٌ﴾ (سوره الاعراف، الايه: 73)\nفاستجابوا لدعوه نبي الله صالح، ثم ارتدوا عن دينهم وعقروا الناقه التي ارسلها الله لهم ايه وتحدَّوه ان ياتيهم بالعذاب فاهلكهم الله بالصيحه، وكانت الناقه في يوم تشرب جميع الماء الموجود في البئر، وتسقي في اليوم التالي كل سكان الحجر من لبنها، وبعد مده من الزمن قرر قوم ثمود قتل الناقه، وعندما قتلوها اهلكهم الله جميعاً بالصيحه، ونجا نبيّه صالح ومن امن معه من قوم ثمود، ومن ثمّ رحل صالح ومن معه من المؤمنين الى مكه المكرمه.\nمن الايات التي ذكرت في القران عن الحِجْر:\n\n﴿وَلَقَدْ كَذَّبَ اَصْحَابُ الْحِجْرِ الْمُرْسَلِينَ ۝٨٠ وَاتَيْنَاهُمْ ايَاتِنَا فَكَانُوا عَنْهَا مُعْرِضِينَ ۝٨١ وَكَانُوا يَنْحِتُونَ مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا امِنِينَ ۝٨٢ فَاَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَهُ مُصْبِحِينَ ۝٨٣ فَمَا اَغْنَى عَنْهُمْ مَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ ۝٨٤﴾ (سوره الحجر، الايه: 80 - 84)\n﴿كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ الْمُرْسَلِينَ، اِذْ قَالَ لَهُمْ اَخُوهُمْ صَالِحٌ اَلَا تَتَّقُونَ، اِنِّي لَكُمْ رَسُولٌ اَمِينٌ، فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاَطِيعُونِ، وَمَا اَسْاَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ اَجْرٍ اِنْ اَجْرِيَ اِلَّا عَلَى رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ، اَتُتْرَكُونَ فِي مَا هَاهُنَا امِنِينَ، فِي جَنَّاتٍ وَعُيُونٍ، وَزُرُوعٍ وَنَخْلٍ طَلْعُهَا هَضِيمٌ، وَتَنْحِتُونَ مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا فَارِهِينَ، فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاَطِيعُونِ، وَلَا تُطِيعُوا اَمْرَ الْمُسْرِفِينَ، الَّذِينَ يُفْسِدُونَ فِي الْاَرْضِ وَلَا يُصْلِحُونَ، قَالُوا اِنَّمَا اَنْتَ مِنَ الْمُسَحَّرِينَ، مَا اَنْتَ اِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِثْلُنَا فَاْتِ بِايَهٍ اِنْ كُنْتَ مِنَ الصَّادِقِينَ، قَالَ هَذِهِ نَاقَهٌ لَهَا شِرْبٌ وَلَكُمْ شِرْبُ يَوْمٍ مَعْلُومٍ، وَلَا تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوءٍ فَيَاْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ، فَعَقَرُوهَا فَاَصْبَحُوا نَادِمِينَ، فَاَخَذَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ اِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَايَهً وَمَا كَانَ اَكْثَرُهُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ، وَاِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ﴾ (سوره الشعراء، الايه: 141 - 159)\n\nفي السُّنَّه\nعن عبد الله بن عمر قال: «لما نزل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بالناس على تبوك نزل بهم الحِجْر عند بيوت ثمود، فاستقى الناس من الابار التي كانت تشرب منها ثمود، فعجنوا منها ونصبوا القدور فامرهم رسول الله فاهرقوا القدور، وعلفوا العجين الابل، ثم ارتحل بهم حتى نزل بهم على البئر التي كانت تشرب منها الناقه، ونهاهم ان يدخلوا على القوم الذين عذبوا، وقال: اني اخشى ان يصيبكم مثل ما اصابهم فلا تدخلوا عليهم».\nعن عبد الله بن عمر قال: «قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وهو بالحِجْر: لا تدخلوا على هؤلاء المعذبين الا ان تكونوا باكين، فان لم تكونوا باكين فلا تدخلوا عليهم ان يصيبكم مثل ما اصابهم». وفي بعض الروايات «ان النبي محمد لما مَرَّ بمنازلهم قنع راسه، واسرع راحلته، ونهى عن دخول منازلهم الا ان تكونوا باكين». وفي روايه: «فان لم تبكوا فتباكوا، خشيه ان يصيبكم مثل ما اصابهم».\nعن عمرو بن سعد (وقيل: عامر بن سعد) قال: «لما كان في غزوه تبوك، فسارع الناس الى اهل الحجر يدخلون عليهم، فبلغ ذلك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، فنادى في الناس: الصلاه جامعه. قال: فاتيت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، وهو ممسك بعيره، وهو يقول: ما تدخلون على قوم غضب الله عليهم؟ فناداه رجل: نعجب منهم يا رسول الله. قال: افلا انبئكم باعجب من ذلك؟ رجل من انفسكم ينبئكم بما كان قبلكم، وما هو كائن بعدكم فاستقيموا وسددوا، فان الله لا يعبا بعذابكم شيئاً، وسياتي قوم لا يدفعون عن انفسهم بشيء».\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع مدائن صالح على بعد 22 كم شمال شرق مدينه العلا، و400 كم شمال غرب المدينه المنوره و500 كم الى الجنوب الشرقي من البتراء الواقعه في الاردن، وتقع تحديداً عند دائره عرض 47 ـ 26 شمالاً، وخط طول 53 ـ 37 شرقاً. يقع الموقع الاثري على منطقه سهليه، عند سفح هضبه من البازلت التي تشكل الجزء الجنوبي الشرقي من جبال الحجاز. الاجزاء الغربيه والشماليه الغربيه للموقع، تحتوي على المياه الجوفيه التي يمكن الوصول اليها على عمق 20 متراً تقريباً. يتميز الموقع بطبيعته الصحراويه التي تتسم بالنتوءات الواقعه على الصخور بمختلف الاحجام والارتفاعات.\nتتميز منطقه مدائن صالح بالتكوينات الصخريه، كما انها تتميز ايضاً بتنوّع الوان صخورها الرمليه بين الاحمر والاصفر والابيض. بالاضافه الى ان الموقع محاط بالكثبان الرمليه من جميع الجهات.\n\nالعماره\nالنحت\nتتميّز المدافن النبطيه في مدائن صالح كونها ليست مبنيه وانما محفوره في الصخور الرمليه، والذي ساهم في سهوله عمليه النحت والحفر، كون تلك الصخور غير صلبه ولكنها تتاثر بعوامل التعريه. تتباين الوان الصخور من الاحمر الى الابيض حسب عمرها، حيث يعود تاريخ الصخور الحمراء الى العصر الكمبري، بينما تعود الصخور البيضاء الى العصر الاردوفيشي، وتتطابق هذه الصخور مع تلك التي استخدمها الانباط في البتراء، وهناك عده تحليلات قام بها خبراء في علم الاثار لتفسير اسلوب النحت المتبع فراوا ان العمليه تمت من الاعلى الى الاسفل، وبما ان اصحاب تلك المدافن من الطبقه الحاكمه او من اثرياء الانباط، فكانت هنالك معايير قبل عمليه النحت، حيث يتم اختيار موقع المدفن فكلما كان قريباً من ناحيه المساكن كان اكثر تكلفه ويقل كلما تباعد عنها، وارتفاع الصخره وجودتها كانت من تلك المعايير ايضاً، فالصخور التي تخلو من الصدوع والشقوق تعمل على ابراز تفاصيل النقوش كالشرفات المدرّجه التي تعرف بسلّم الغراب، والكورنيش على النمط المصري والعتب وتيجان الاعمده التي يتم نحتها على الصخور الجيده، ولكن احياناً يتعذّر على النحات معرفه جوده الصخره في البدايه ليتم اكتشافها لاحقاً اثناء النحت، كما يتم تحديد ارتفاع المدفن بشكل دقيق وذلك بحسب الادوات المتوفره لديهم، وعندما لا تكون هنالك طبقه طبيعيه ناتئه في الصخر يتم نحت قناه افقيه في الصخره فوق اعلى نقطه في الواجهه المنحوته، لتمنع من تساقط الامطار على الواجهه،\nهناك تناسب بين طول واجهه المدفن وعرضه حيث ان ارتفاع المدفن يتحدد بناءً على عرضه، وبالنسبه للمدافن الكبيره فكان يعمل عليها عدد من النحاتين سواءً كانوا اثنان او اكثر من ذلك، فيعمل كل واحد في طرف بحيث يتم الالتقاء في منتصف الواجهه، وتختلف كميه الصخور التي يتم نحتها قبل الوصول للواجهه من مدفن الى اخر، وكان النحاتون يستعملون المنصات الطبيعيه المتكونه نتيجه اختلاف مستوى طبقات التكوين الصخري ليقفوا عليها، وعادهً ما يقوم النحّات بالانتهاء من جميع تنفيذ جميع تفاصيل النحت التي تتم في الواجهه من زخارف قبل النزول للاسفل، كما يتم اعداد اللوحه التي يُكتب عليها النص التاسيس ويتم عاده قطعها فوق المدفن، ولكن الكتابه غالباً ما تتم من قِبل كاتب مختص، ويشترك العمّال في تنفيذ اعمال النحت تحت اشراف رئيس النحاتين واحياناً اثنان من النحاتين ترِد اسماؤهم تحت النص التاسيسي للمدفن، وهناك مجموعه من النحاتين ينتسبون لعائله واحده ظهر ذلك من خلال كتابه اسمائهم على عدد من اللوحات، ومن اشهرهم شخص اسمه «افتح» حيث قام بتنفيذ خمسه مدافن وساهم في اثنين اخرين. هناك بعض العناصر التي عُملت على الواجهه تمت من قبل اشخاص مختصين بذلك ويتم تنفيذ تلك العناصر سواء بشكل مباشر على الصخره او بنحتها بشكل منفصل ومن ثم الحاقها بالمكان المخصص لها في الواجهه. يتم عمل الاسطح الملساء التي تتميز بها الواجهات راسياً بواسطه معول مستدق الراس من الطرفين او الازميل وهو وتد حديدي مدبب من احد الطرفين ومسطح في الاخر يتم العمل به عن طريق طرقه بمطرقه.\n\nهناك اجزاء من الواجهه مثل المساحه بين الشرفات والعتب والعارضه اسفل تاج العمود يتم تجصيصها ودهنها بلون اسود او احمر، حيث ان هناك عدد من المدافن لا تزال تحتفظ باثار الجص المستخدم. كان النحاتون يستخدمون بالاضافه الى ادوات النحت والحفر ادوات القياس، ومنها مقياس الخط العمودي، وشاقول تحديد الاستواء، والمربع، والحبل، واحياناً الفرجار. هناك عدد من المدافن غير المكتمله في الموقع، ويعود معظمها لنواحٍ فنيه على ما يبدو، امّا ان يكون بسبب ان النحات قد واجه طبقه ملحيه اتت من سطح الارض، واما ان يكون بسبب شق في الصخره لم يظهر في بدايه العمل بالنحت، او ظهور طبقه تحتوي على الكثير من الحصى.\nالعنصر الاخر في المدفن هو حُجره الدفن ويتم حفرها في الصخره خلف الواجهه، وحجرات الدفن لا تكون عاده بنفس مستوى ارتفاع الواجهات، ومستوى سقف الغرفه يكون متوافقاً مع العتبه العليا للباب، والاداه الوحيده المستخدمه داخل المدافن كانت المعول مستدق الطرفين، ويوجد عدد من حجرات المدافن غير المكتمله، وربما يعود ذلك كون صاحب المدفن يهتم بالواجهه الخارجيه اكثر من الحجره الداخليه، ومكان الدفن المنحوت داخل الحجره يتكوّن من ثلاثه انواع، كوّه او حفره او حجره مصمته، وكان ينفذ عندما يتوفى احد افراد العائله، وحين يكون المكان في شكل حجره فهي تُحفر بحسب حجم الشخص المتوفّى، وعاده ما تكون حجرات الدفن غير منتظمه.\nقام الباحث جان كلود بيساك بتقدير الفتره المطلوبه لتنفيذ مدفن متوسط الحجم بسنه وشهرين، وتستغرق عمليه حفر الواجهه المده الاطول التي قد تستغرق سبعه اشهر، اما حجره المدفن فتستغرق ما بين اربعه الى خمسه اشهر وهي تقريباً نفس المده التي تتطلبها عمليه نحت التفاصيل.\n\nالكتابات والنقوش\nتتنوع الكتابات الموجوده في مدائن صالح، فهناك العربيه الجنوبيه، واللحيانيه، والثموديه، والنبطيه، واللاتينيه، والاسلاميه. كما ان مواضيع هذه النقوش تتنوع بين النقوش الدينيه والنقوش التاسيسيه والنقوش التذكاريه، اما اكثر النقوش الموجوده في الموقع فهي النقوش الملكيه. تنتشر في الموقع النقوش النبطيه كون الموقع وصل لاوج ازدهاره فتره العصر النبطي، وهي تنتشر على واجهات الجبال، وكذلك في اماكن على واجهات المقابر، وقد تضمنت معلومات عن ملكيه المقبره، وما تحتويه من شروط للدفن فيها من قبل اصحابها وورثتهم، كما انها تحتوي ايضاً على نصوص يتم فيها تحديد العقوبه التي يجب ان تقع على من يخالف قانون الدفن، وبعض النقوش مؤرخه كما تحتوي على اسم النحّات.\n\nالمواقع الاثريه\nواجهات المقابر المنحوته\nمدافن جبل المحجر\nتعرف مجموعه مدافن جبل المحجر كذلك باسم (المنطقه ا)، وتقع الى الشمال من مجموعه مدافن قصر البنت بالقرب من البئر النبطي، وهي عباره عن ثلاث كُتَل صخريه نُحِتت فيها اربعه عشر مدفناً نبطيّاً، حيث تضم الكتله الصخريه الاولى منها سته مدافن، وتضم الثانيه خمسه مدافن، بينما تضم الثالثه والمسماه بجبل المحجر ثلاثه مدافن.\n\nمدافن قصر البنت\nتعرف مجموعه مدافن قصر البنت ايضاً باسم (المنطقه ب)، وتقع الى الغرب من جبل اثلب، وتتكون من جبلين احدهما كبير حيث يمتد من الشمال الى الجنوب ويضم 31 مدفناً، والاخر صغير يقع شمال غربي الجبل الاول ويضم مدفنين في واجهته الشرقيه.\n\nمدافن الجبل الاحمر\nتعرف مجموعه مدافن الجبل الاحمر ايضاً باسم (المنطقه ج)، وتقع الى الجنوب الغربي من مجموعه مدافن قصر البنت، والى الشمال الغربي من منطقه «د»، وتضم كتلتين صخريتين، تحتوي الاولى على 18 مدفناً. بينما تتكون الكتله الثانيه من مدفن واحد فقط، وهي تقع جنوب الكتله الاولى.\n\nمدافن المنطقه «د»\nتقع المنطقه «د» شرق منطقه قصر الصانع، حيث تتكون من جبلين في كل واحد منهما مقبره واحده فقط. في المدفن (رقم: 109) يظهر بان العمل قد اكتمل في الغرفه الخاصه بالدفن، بينما الجزء السفلي من واجهه المدفن غير مكتمله. بالنسبه للمدفن (رقم: 111) يظهر بان واجهته قد اكتملت، بينما غرفه الدفن غير مكتمله.\n\nمدافن الخريمات\nتقع منطقه الخريمات جنوب غربي الحِجْر، وتحتوي على 53 مدفناً موزعه على تسعه جبال، وتتميز واجهات المدافن بتعدد العناصر المعماريه والزخرفيه، كما ان المنطقه تاثرت بعوامل التعريه والسيول بسبب انخفاض المنطقه. الجبل الاول يضم خمسه مدافن (رقم: 50 - 54)، بينما يضم الجبل الثاني مدفناً وحيداً (رقم: 49)، وكذلك الجبل الثالث الذي يضم مدفناً واحداً (رقم:55)، اما الجبل الرابع فيضم سبعه مدافن (رقم: 56 - 62)، وبالنسبه للجبل الخامس فهو يضم سته عشر مدفناً (رقم: 63 - 78)، والجبل السادس يضم مدفناً واحداً (رقم: 79)، بالاضافه الى الجبل السابع الذي يضم سته عشر مدفناً (رقم: 80 - 95)، والجبل الثامن يضم خمسه مدافن (رقم: 96 - 100)، والجبل التاسع يضم مدفناً واحداً (رقم: 101).\n\nقصر الصانع\nتقع مجموعه قصر الصانع في الجهه الجنوبيه من منطقه الحِجْر، وتتكون من كتلتين صخريتين. الكتله الغربيه تضم مدفناً واحداً يُعرف بقصر الصانع، حيث ان واجهته تعلوها شرفات مدرّجه في اسفلها كورنيش ثم شريط فاصل ثم كورنيش اخر يبرز بشكل اقل عن سابقه، تليه عارضتان يقع بينهما شريط فاصل، وتقع العارضه السفلى على عمودين ذات تيجان نبطيه، ويتوسط المدخل الجزء الجنوبي من الواجهه، وعلى جانبه عمودان تيجانهما نبطيه. بينما الكتله الشرقيه تحتوي على سته مدافن وهي بسيطه في نحتها.\n\nقصر الفريد\nسمي بالقصر الفريد كونه يقع منفرداً في كتله صخريه مستقله، ولتميّزه معماريّاً حيث يتفرّد بوجود عمودين نبطيّين بوسط الجزء السفلي في واجهته الصخريه بالاضافه الى الاعمده الجانبيه، ولكن المدفن غير مكتمل وخاصه في جزء الواجهه السفلي والبرحه الاماميه للمدخل، والنقش التاسيسي للمدفن غير مؤرخ.\nتوجد اعلى واجهه المدفن شرفات مدرّجه على الجانبين في اسفلها كورنيش ثم شريط فاصل ثم كورنيش اخر يحتوي على بروز اقل من السابق تليه عارضه، وعلى جانبه عمودين بتيجان نبطيه، بالاضافه الى عمودين اخرين في وسط الواجهه وهو الذي ميّزها عن باقي المدافن، ويتوسط المدخل الجزء السفلي من الواجهه، ومن عناصره المكتمله الاطار العام لكورنيش يظهر اعلاه نحت لنسر فارد جناحيه، بالاضافه الى منحوتات لانيه تظهر على جانبي الكورنيش، كما يعلوه نقش تاسيسي نصّه «لحيان بن كوزا وذريته».\n\nمدافن المنطقه السكنيه\nتقع مدافن المنطقه السكنيه ضمن المنطقه السهليه التي تتوسط الموقع، ويحيط بها سور له اثار باقيه من الجهات الشماليه والجنوبيه والغربيه، تتوسطها رموز دينيه بارزه.\n\nالمنطقه الدينيه\nتقع المنطقه الدينيه في الجهه الشماليه للحِجْر وتحديداً في جبال اثلب، وكان قد اتخذها الانباط مركزاً دينيّاً لهم، وتتكوّن المنطقه من الديوان والمعابد والمحاريب وقصر العجوز. يعتبر الديوان من اهم المنشات الدينيه فيها، وهو مكان مخصص للتجمعات الدينيه، ويتكوّن من حجره في الجبل وهي مستطيله الشكل، كما ان مدخل الديوان مفتوح وعلى جانبه عمودان ذوا تيجان نبطيّه تعلوهما عارضه، وتوجد بالديوان ثلاث دكات منحوته ومتصله ببعضها وهي ترتفع عن سطح الارض ويتم الصعود اليها عن طريق درج منحوت في جانبي المدخل، كما ان هناك اربعه اعمده تيجانها نبطيه يعلوها افريز بارز وهي تقع في اركان الديوان، وهناك ممر ضيق مجاور للديوان يعرف بـ «السيق»، حيث تنتشر على جانبيه النقوش والمحاريب.\nتنتشر المعابد على مرتفعات جبل اثلب في منطقه الديوان وفي بطن منطقه المنخض الصخري، وهي تمثل المنطقه الدينيه التي انشئت للمعبودات الوثنيه الخاصه باهل الحِجْر. بالنسبه لقصر العجوز فهو معبد او مركز للكهنه يقع الى الجنوب من جبل اثلب، يتميز بكون مدخله مفتوح بحجم اتساع الحجره المنحوته، يوجد في الجدار الايمن للحجره كوَّتان مربعتان، بينما يوجد في الجدار الاخر خمس كوَّات، في يمينها مدخل يصل بحُجره صغيره.\nتتركز المحاريب في جنوب المنطقه الدينيه، وهي من الامور الدينيه التي تتميز بها حضاره الانباط، حيث تُجسّد فيها رموز معبوداتهم الوثنيه، وقد حُفرت المحاريب في صخور تختلف في اشكالها واحجامها، وهذه المحاريب عباره عن تجاويب يتقدمها عمودان يحملان قوساً نصف دائري، في وسط كل محراب او اعلاه نحت بارز يرمز للمعبودات الوثنيه، وقد يكون بعض هذه المحاريب لا يحتوي على اي رموز.\n\nالمنطقه السكنيه\nتقع المنطقه السكنيه في وسط منطقه الحِجْر، في ارض سهليه منبسطه، وقد تم تحديد اسوار تحيط بها من ثلاث جهات، كما كشفت الحفائر عن عدد من المراحل المعماريه التي قامت عليها، مما يدل على عُمق الاستيطان بالمنطقه، حيث تم الكشف عن وحدات معماريه ومبان طينيه فوق اساسات حجريّه قامت عليها، وكانت تلك الاحجار تقطع من جبل المحجر وغيره من الجبال المجاوره، وبالاضافه الى الاساسات فقد كانت الاحجار تستخدم في الاحواض الحجريه والاعمده وتيجانها. تم العثور في المنطقه السكنيه على العديد من الاشياء كالعملات والفخاريات والمساجر والمجامر والدمى وغيرها من الاشياء التي اُرِّخَت في الفتره النبطيه.\n\nالابار والقنوات المائيه\nتوجد بالموقع مجموعه من الابار والقنوات المائيه، حيث عُثر على اكثر من ستين بئرا محفوره في الصخر، بعضها يصل عمقه لاكثر من ثلاثين متراً، وهي تتمثل بابار دائريه المقطع يضيق قطرها من الاسفل وبعضها مطوي، فقد عُرِف عن الانباط عنايتهم بالمياه وحفظها والتحكم بها عن طريق شبكه هندسيه دقيقه، وقد ظل بعض هذه الابار مستخدماً الى وقتٍ قريب. اما فيما يتعلق بقنوات المياه فقد تم الكشف عن جزء منها، وهي مبنيه من الحجر يتصل بعضها بصهاريج كانت تستخدم في تخزين المياه والتي هي الاخرى مبنيه من الحجر ومبنيه تحت الارض، وبعض هذه الصهاريج يحتوي على فتحات لاستخراج المياه.\n\nالبئر النبطيه\nالبئر النبطيه عباره عن بئر عميقه تقع قرب جبل المحجر ومجموعه القبور الموجوده حوله، وهي واحده من خمسه وستين بئراً اكتشفت بالموقع، وكان قد استخدمها الانباط في ري مزروعاتهم وسقياهم. حالياً البئر محاطه بسياج معدني يمنع النزول اليها، وهناك مجرى محفور في الصخور الواقعه في الجبل كان يستخدم في توجيه المياه من الجبل الى البئر.\n\nمدافن الرجوم الركاميه\nهنالك مدافن على شكل رجم من الحجاره يتراوح عرضه ما بين متر ونصف الى عشره امتار، بينما يصل ارتفاع بعضها الى المتر، تحتوي بعضها على دعامات بشكل سرداب. معظم هذه المدافن تقع على قمم التكوينات الصخريه الممتده في الاجزاء الجنوبيه والغربيه من مدائن صالح، وقد تم تسجيل اكثر من 325 موقعاً. في 2008م اجريت حفريات اثريه للمدافن، حيث كانت قبل عمليه الحفر تبدو كرجم من الحجاره بعرض سبعه امتار وارتفاع متر، وبعد الحفر ظهر بان هيكل المدفن عباره عن مقبره تتخذ شكل برج قطره 7,30 م يتكون من وحدتين بينهما فاصل بطول 1,90 م مليء بكتل حجريه، ويبدو ان المدفن يعود الى الالف الثاني او الثالث قبل الميلاد، حيث انه يختلف عن الاسلوب النبطي، ويرجح انه يرتبط بحضاره اخرى.\n\nطريق الحج الشامي\nفي العهد العثماني وفي سبيل حمايه قوافل الحجاج تم انشاء عده قلاع على امتداد الطريق المؤدي الى بلاد الشام، منها قلعه الحجر العثمانيه في مدائن صالح، وهي عباره عن مبنى مربّع الشكل مكوّن من طابقين، في شمالها يوجد المدخل ويعلوه برج للمراقبه، وهذا المدخل يؤدي الى فناء داخلي يتوسطه بئر مطوي، وتتوزع حوله الغرف في جهاته الاربع، كما ان هناك مُصلّى صغير يقع في جنوب الفناء. في الطابق العلوي هناك ابراج تتوزع في اركان القلعه، كما تكثر فتحات السهام في الطابق، بالاضافه الى ذلك توجد في جنوب القلعه بِرْكه تستمدّ ماؤها من البئر الموجوده هناك.\n\nسكه حديد الحجاز\nفي بدايه القرن الرابع عشر الهجري الموافق للقرن العشرين الميلادي امر السلطان عبد الحميد الثاني بانشاء سكه حديد على ان تربط اسطنبول بالمدينه المنوره مروراً ببلاد الشام، وكان قد بدا المشروع بالحط سنه 1317 هـ الموافقه لسنه 1899م وانتهى سنه 1325 هـ الموافقه بسنه 1907م، حيث
