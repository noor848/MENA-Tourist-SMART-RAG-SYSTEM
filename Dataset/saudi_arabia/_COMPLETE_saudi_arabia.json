          "content": "Hegra (Ancient Greek: Ἕγρα, Arabic: ٱلْحِجْر‎, romanized: al-Ḥijr), also known as Madaʾin Salih (Arabic: مَدَائِن صَالِح‎, romanized: Madāʾin Ṣāliḥ, lit. 'Cities of Salih'), is an archaeological site located in the area of Al-'Ula within Medina Province in the Hejaz region, Saudi Arabia. \nA majority of the remains date from the Nabataean Kingdom (1st century AD). The site constituted the kingdom's southernmost and second largest city after Petra (modern-day Jordan), its capital city. Traces of Lihyanite and Roman occupation before and after the Nabataean rule, respectively, can also be found. The site features more than 110 well-preserved Nabataean tombs carved into sandstone outcrops.\nThe archaeological site lies in an arid environment. The dry climate, the lack of resettlement after the site was abandoned, and the prevailing local beliefs about the locality have all led to the extraordinary state of preservation of Al-Hijr, providing an extensive picture of the Nabataean lifestyle. Thought to mark the southern extent of the Nabataean kingdom, Al-Hijr's oasis agriculture and extant wells exhibit the necessary adaptations made by the Nabataeans in the given environment—its markedly distinct settlement is the second largest among the Nabataean kingdom, complementing that of the more famous Petra archaeological site in Jordan. The location of the site at the crossroads of trade, and the various languages, scripts and artistic styles reflected in the façades of its monumental tombs further set it apart from other archaeological sites. It has duly earned the nickname \"The Capital of Monuments\" among Saudi Arabia's 4,000 archaeological sites.\nThe Quran places the settlement of the area by the Thamudi people during the days of the prophet Salih, between those of Nuh (Noah) and Hud on one hand, and those of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses) on the other. However, a definitive historical chronology can not be obtained through the order of verses because the Quranic chapters (see surah) deal with different subjects in non-chronologic order. According to the Quran, the Thamudis were punished by God for their idolatry, struck by an earthquake and lightning blasts. Thus, the site has earned a reputation as a cursed place—an image which the national government is attempting to overcome as it seeks to develop Mada'in Salih for its potential for tourism.\nIn 2008, UNESCO proclaimed Mada'in Salih as a site of patrimony, becoming Saudi Arabia's first World Heritage Site. It was chosen for its well-preserved remains from late antiquity, especially the 131 monumental rock-cut tombs, with their elaborately ornamented façades, of the Nabataean Kingdom.\n\nLocation\nThe archaeological site of Hegra is situated 20 km (12 mi) north of the town of Al-'Ula, 400 km (250 miles) northwest of Medina, and 500 km (310 miles) southeast of Petra, Jordan. Istakhri wrote in his Routes of the Realms (مسالك الممالك‎):\n\nAl-Hijr is a small village. It belongs to Wadi al Gura and is located at one day's travel inside the mountains. It was the homeland of the Thamudians. I have seen those mountains and their carvings. Their houses are similar to ours but are carved in the mountains, which are called the Ithlib mountains. It looks as if they are a continuous range but they are separated and have sand dunes around them. You can reach the top of the mountains, but this is extremely tiring. The well of the Thamudians which is mentioned in the Holy Quran is located in the middle of the mountains.\nThe site is on a plain at the foot of a basalt plateau that forms a portion of the Hijaz Mountains. Beneath the western and northwestern parts of the site, the water table can be reached at a depth of 20 metres (66 ft). The setting is notable for its desert landscape, marked by sandstone outcroppings of various sizes and heights.\n\nHistory\nName\nIts long history and the multitude of cultures occupying the site have produced several names. References by Strabo and other Mediterranean writers use the name Hegra (Ancient Greek: Ἔγρα) for the Nabataean site. The use of Mada'in Salih refers to the (Prophet) Salih, sent to ancient Arabs, a name and identity which may be derived from the biblical figure Methuselah (Hebrew: מְתוּשֶׁלַח‎, romanized: Məṯūšélaḥ, in pausa מְתוּשָׁלַח‎ Məṯūšālaḥ \"Man of the javelin\" or \"Death of Sword\"; Greek: Μαθουσάλας, romanized: Mathousálas).\n\nAlthough Hegra was for a long time not as important as Dedan, foreigners appear to have called the oasis Hegra. For example, the famous statue of the Achaemenid king Darius the Great made in Egypt and erected in Susa calls the Arabs hgr.\n\nRock writings\nRecent archaeological work has revealed numerous rock writings and pictures not only on Mount Athleb, but also throughout central Arabia. They date between the sixth century BC and the fourth century AD and are labelled as being Thamudic, a name invented by nineteenth-century scholars for these large numbers of inscriptions which had not yet been properly studied.\n\nLihyan/Dedanite era\nArchaeological traces of cave art on the sandstones and epigraphs (inscriptions), considered by experts to be Lihyanite script, on top of the Athleb Mountain, near Hegra (Madaʾin Salih), have been dated to the 3rd–2nd century BC, indicating the early human settlement of the area, which has an accessible source of freshwater and fertile soil. The settlement of the Lihyans became a centre of commerce, with goods from the east, north and south converging in the locality.\n\nNabataean era\nThe extensive settlement of the site took place during the 1st century AD, when it came under the rule of the Nabataean king Aretas IV Philopatris (Al-Harith IV) (9 BC – 40 AD), who made Hegra (Madaʾin Salih) the kingdom's second capital, after Petra in the north. The place enjoyed a huge urbanization movement, turning it into a city. Characteristic of Nabateaan rock-cut architecture, the geology of Hegra (Madaʾin Salih) provided the perfect medium for the carving of monumental structures, with Nabataean scripts inscribed on their façades. \nThe Nabataeans also developed oasis agriculture—digging wells and rainwater tanks in the rock and carving places of worship in the sandstone outcroppings. Similar structures were featured in other Nabataean settlements, ranging from southern Syria (region) to the north, going south to the Negev, and down to the immediate area of the Hejaz. The most prominent and the largest of these is Petra.\nAt the crossroad of commerce, the Nabataean kingdom flourished, holding a monopoly for the trade of incense, myrrh and spices. Situated on the overland caravan route and connected to the Red Sea port of Egra Kome, Hegra, as it was known among the Nabataeans, reached its peak as the major staging post on the main north–south trade route.\n\nRoman era\nIn 106 AD, the Nabataean kingdom was annexed by the contemporary Roman Empire. The Hejaz, which encompasses Hegra, became part of the Roman province of Arabia.\n\nThe Hedjaz region was integrated into the Roman province of Arabia in 106 AD. A monumental Roman epigraph of 175–177 AD was recently discovered at al-Hijr (then called \"Hijr\" and now Mada'in Salih).\n\nThe trading itinerary shifted from the overland north–south axis on the Arabian Peninsula to the maritime route through the Red Sea. Thus, Hegra as a centre of trade began to decline, leading to its abandonment. Supported by the lack of later developments based on archaeological studies, experts have hypothesized that the site had lost all of its urban functions beginning in late antiquity (mainly due to the process of desertification). In the 1960s and 1970s, evidence was discovered that the Roman legions of Trajan occupied Mada'in Salih in northeastern Arabia, increasing the extension of the Arabia Petraea province of the Romans in Arabia.\nThe history of Hegra during the period from the decline of the Roman Empire until the emergence of Islam remains unknown. It was only sporadically mentioned by travellers and pilgrims making their way to Mecca in the succeeding centuries. Hegra served as a station along the Hajj route, providing supplies and water for pilgrims. Among the accounts is a description made by 14th-century traveller Ibn Battuta, noting the red stone-cut tombs of Hegra, by then known as \"al-Hijr\". However, he made no mention of human activities there.\n\nOttoman era\nThe Ottoman Empire annexed western Arabia from the Mamluks by 1517. In early Ottoman accounts of the Hajj road between Damascus and Mecca, Hegra (Madaʾin Salih) is not mentioned, until 1672, when the Turkish traveller, Evliya Celebi noted that the caravan passed through a place called \"Abyar Salih\" where there were the remains of seven cities. It is again mentioned by the traveller Murtada ibn 'Alawan as a rest stop on the route called \"al-Mada'in\". Between 1744 and 1757, a fort was built at al-Hijr on the orders of the Ottoman governor of Damascus, As'ad Pasha al-Azm. A cistern supplied by a large well within the fort was also built, and the site served as a one-day stop for Hajj pilgrims where they could purchase goods such as dates, lemons and oranges. It was part of a series of fortifications built to protect the pilgrimage route to Mecca.\nAccording to the researches of Al-Ansari, the Ottoman castle was found near the settlement dating to the year 1600 AD in 1984.\n\n19th century\nIn 1812, Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered Petra for the Western world. In the aftermath of the news making the rounds, Charles Montagu Doughty, an English traveller, heard of a similar site near Hegra (Madaʾin Salih), a fortified Ottoman town on the Hajj road from Damascus. To access the site, Doughty joined the Hajj caravan, and reached the site of the ruins in 1876, recording the visit in his journal which was published as Travels in Arabia Deserta. Doughty described the Ottoman fort, where he resided for two months, and noted that Bedouin tribesmen had a permanent encampment just outside of the building.\nIn the 19th century, there were accounts that the extant wells and oasis agriculture of al-Hijr were being periodically used by settlers from the nearby village of Tayma. This continued until the 20th century, when the Hejaz Railway that passed through the site was constructed (1901–08) on the orders of Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II to link Damascus and Jerusalem in the north-west with Medina and Mecca, hence facilitating the pilgrimage journey to the latter and to politically and economically consolidate the Ottoman administration of the centres of Islamic faith. A station was built north of al-Hijr for the maintenance of locomotives, and offices and dormitories for railroad staff. The railway provided greater accessibility to the site. However, this was destroyed in a local revolt during World War I. Despite this, several archaeological investigations continued to be conducted in the site beginning in the World War I period to the establishment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the 1930s up to the 1960s. The former railway station, restored and redeveloped, has been transformed into the Chedi Hegra Resort, opened in 2024. The project incorporates the historic station within the hotel complex, designed by the Milan-based architecture firm Giò Forma in collaboration with Black Engineering, and operated by General Hotel Management Ltd. (GHM) under its luxury brand The Chedi.\nBy the end of the 1960s, the Saudi Arabian government devised a program to introduce a sedentary lifestyle to the nomadic Bedouin tribes inhabiting the area. It was proposed that they settle down in al-Hijr, re-using the already existent wells and agricultural features of the site. However, the official identification of al-Hijr as an archaeological site in 1972 led to the resettlement of the Bedouins towards the north, beyond the site boundary. This also included the development of new agricultural land and freshly dug wells, thereby preserving the state of al-Hijr.\n\nRecent developments\nIn 1962, examples of many inscriptions were discovered and renewed the archaeological assessment of Hijr (Madaʾin Salih) by Winnett and Reed. Although the Al-Hijr site was proclaimed as an archaeological treasure in the early 1970s, few investigations had been conducted since. Mirdad had lived here for a short time and wrote notices about the region since 1977. Healey studied here in 1985 and wrote a book about the inscriptions of Hijr (Madaʾin Salih) in 1993.\nThe prohibition on the veneration of objects/artifacts has resulted in minimal archaeological activities. These conservative measures started to ease up beginning in 2000, when Saudi Arabia invited expeditions to carry out archaeological explorations as part of the government's push to promote cultural heritage protection and tourism. The archaeological site was proclaimed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008. More recent archaeological studies of the area have been made as part of efforts to document and preserve the heritage sites prior to opening the area to more tourism.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Nabataean site of Hegra was built around a residential zone and its oasis during the 1st century CE. The sandstone outcroppings were carved to build the necropolis. A total of four necropolis sites have survived, which featured 131 monumental rock-cut tombs spread out over 13.4 km (8.3 miles), many with inscribed Nabataean epigraphs on their façades:\n\nNon-monumental burial sites, totaling 2,000, are also part of the place. A closer observation of the façades indicates the social status of the buried person—the size and ornamentation of the structure reflect the wealth of the person. Some façades had plates on top of the entrances providing information about the grave owners, the religious system, and the masons who carved them. Many graves indicate military ranks, leading archaeologists to speculate that the site might once have been a Nabataean military base, meant to protect the settlement's trading activities.\nThe Nabataean kingdom was not just situated at the crossroad of trade but also of culture. This is reflected in the varying motifs of the façade decorations, borrowing stylistic elements from Assyria, Phoenicia, Egypt and Hellenistic Alexandria, combined with the native artistic style. Roman decorations and Latin scripts also figured on the troglodytic tombs when the territory was annexed by the Roman Empire. In contrast to the elaborate exteriors, the interiors of the rock-cut structures are severe and plain.\nA religious area, known as \"Jabal Ithlib,\" is located to the north-east of the site. It is believed to have been originally dedicated to the Nabataean deity Dushara. A narrow corridor, 40 metres (131 ft) long between the high rocks and reminiscent of the Siq in Petra, leads to the hall of the Diwan, a Muslim's council-chamber or law-court. Small religious sanctuaries bearing inscriptions were also cut into the rock in the vicinity.\nThe residential area is located in the middle of the plain, far from the outcrops. The primary material of construction for the houses and the enclosing wall was sun-dried mudbrick. Few vestiges of the residential area remain.\nWater is supplied by 130 wells, situated in the western and north-western part of the site, where the water table was at a depth of only 20 m (66 ft). The wells, with diameters ranging 4–7 m (13–23 ft), were cut into the rock, although some, dug in loose ground, had to be reinforced with sandstone.\n\nIn the Qur'an\nAccording to the Quran, the site of al-Hijr was settled by the tribe of Thamud, who \"(took) for (themselves) palaces from its plains and (carved) from the mountains, homes\".[Quran 7:73–79][Quran 11:61–69][Quran 15:80–84] The tribe fell to idol worship, and oppression became prevalent. The prophet Salih, to whom the site's name of Mada'in Salih is often attributed, called on the Thamudis to repent. The Thamudis disregarded the warning and instead commanded Salih to summon a pregnant she-camel from the back of a mountain. And so a pregnant she-camel was sent to the people from the back of the mountain, as proof of Salih's divine mission.\nHowever, only a minority heeded his words. The non-believers killed the sacred camel instead of caring for it as they were told, and its calf ran back to the mountain from whence it came. The Thamudis were given three days before their punishment was to take place, since they disbelieved and did not heed the warning. Salih and his monotheistic followers left the city, but the others were punished by God—their souls leaving their lifeless bodies in the midst of an earthquake and lightning blasts.\nRobert G. Hoyland suggested that their name was subsequently adopted by other new groups that inhabited the region of Mada'in Salih after the disappearance of the original people of Thamud. This suggestion is also supported by the narration of ʿAbdullah ibn ʿUmar and analysis of Ibn Kathir which report that people called the region of Thamud al-Hijr, while they called the province of Mada'in Salih as Arḍ Thamūd \"Land of Thamud\" and Bayt Thamud (house of Thamud). So the term \"Thamud\" was not applied to the groups that lived in Mada'in Salih, such as Lihyanites and Nabataeans, but rather to the region itself, and according to classical sources, it was agreed upon that the only remaining group of the native people of Thamud is the tribe of Banu Thaqif which inhabited the city of Taif south of Mecca.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of World Heritage Sites in Saudi Arabia\nIram of the Pillars\nLeuke Kome\nLihyan\nNabataeans\nList of colossal sculptures in situ\nAncient towns in Saudi Arabia\n\nFootnotes\nFurther reading\nAbdul Rahman Ansary; Ḥusayn Abu Al-Ḥassān (2001).

          "content": "مَدَائِن صَالِح كانت تعرف قديماً بـ الحِجْر، هي موقع اثري يقع في اقليم الحجاز في شبه الجزيره العربيه، شمال غرب المملكه العربيه السعوديه وتحديداً في محافظه العُلا التابعه لمنطقه المدينه المنوره. يحتل المكان موقعاً استراتيجياً على الطريق الذي يربط جنوب شبه الجزيره العربيه ببلاد الرافدين وبلاد الشام ومصر، كما ان للمكان شهرته التاريخيه التي استمدّها من موقعه على طريق التجاره القديم الذي يربط جنوب شبه الجزيره العربيه والشام، والحجر اسم ديار ثمود بوادي القرى بين المدينه المنوره وتبوك. ورد ذكر الحجر في القران على انها موطن قوم ثمود، الذين استجابوا لدعوه نبي الله صالح، ثم ارتدُّوا عن دينهم وعقروا الناقه التي ارسلها الله لهم ايه فاهلكهم بالصيحه.\nتعد مدائن صالح من اهم حواضر الانباط بعد عاصمتهم البتراء، اذ تحتوي على اكبر مستوطنه جنوبيه لمملكه الانباط بعد البتراء في الاردن، والتي تفصلها عنها مسافه 500 كم، ويعود ابرز ادوارها الحضاريه الى القرنين الاول قبل الميلاد والاول الميلادي، وذلك خلال فتره ازدهار الدوله النبطيه وقبل سقوطها على يد الامبراطوريه الرومانيه عام 106م، ويُعتقد ان الحِجْر استمرت في حضارتها حتى القرن الرابع الميلادي، وكانت عاصمه مملكه لحيان في شمال شبه الجزيره العربيه.\nتضم اثار مدائن صالح 153 واجهه صخريه منحوته، كما تضم عدداً من الاثار الاسلاميه والتي تتمثل في عدد من القلاع وبقايا خط سكه حديد الحجاز والتي تمتد لمسافه 13 كم وكذلك المحطه والقاطرات. في سنه 2008م تم تسجيل الموقع ضمن قائمه مواقع التراث العالمي، ليصبح بذلك اول موقع يتم تسجيله في السعوديه.\nكما يوجد موقع اثري اخر يعرف بمدائن شعيب يقع شمال غرب مدائن صالح ويتبع منطقه تبوك، حيث يحتوي الموقع على اثار تشبه الى حد كبير تلك الموجوده في مدائن صالح.\n\nالتاريخ\nمملكه دادان\nهي مملكه تابعه لمملكه معين من القرن الخامس ق.م حتى بدايات الاول ق.م، قامت في الحِجْر والاجزاء الشماليه الغربيه من شبه الجزيره العربيه، واغلب الظن انها مرحله سابقه لمملكه لحيان حيث يعتقد بعض الباحثين ان اللحيانيين كانوا من سكان العربيه الجنوبيه، لورود نص يشير الى قيل لحياني في اليمن اسمه «اب يدع ذو لحيان» واستوطنوا دادان جنوب اراضي لحيان، فلما ضعفت حكومه المعينيين في اليمن استولى اللحيانيون على المملكه واسموها على اسم قبيلتهم، وليس بين الباحثين اتفاق على اصولهم تحديداً، ويرى جواد علي ان المعينيين كوَّنوا مستعمرات في اعالي الحجاز منذ القرن الخامس قبل الميلاد ووصفهم باللحيانيين ايام قوه المعينيين، وهدف هذه المستعمرات هو تامين الطريق التجاريه من اليمن الى الشام. ووفقاً لورنر كاسكل: \n\n اغلب بضاعتهم القادمه من جنوب شبه الجزيره العربيه كانت موجهه لمصر واليونان ويعتقد كاسكل ان اللحيانيين استولوا عليها في منتصف القرن الثاني ق.م قرابه 150 ق.م فقد كان المعينيون يسيطرون على الحِجْر واعالي الحجاز من القرن الخامس ق.م بمساعده من اللحيانيين بدلاله ان اول ملوكهم كان معينياً ثم عادت للحيان مستغلين ضعف مملكه معين وحروبها مع مملكه سبا. يرى جواد علي ان اللحيانيين ينحدرون من النبي اسماعيل، وقد عدهم بلينيوس الاكبر في جمله الشعوب العربيه كذلك.\n\nاللحيانيون\nيختلف المؤرخون في اصل اللحيانيين، فمنهم من يرى انهم فرع من ثمود، بينما يرى اخرون انهم احد الشعوب العربيه الجنوبيه، بدليل انه قد ورد اسم لحيان في نص عربي جنوبي. كانت العلا مركزاً للحيانيين، حيث كانت مستعمره معينيه قديمه، كما انها القاعده الشماليه القصوى للحضاره العربيه الجنوبيه، تقع في وادي القرى جنوب شرق حره العويرض بين سلسله من الجبال في الشرق والغرب، وعلى بُعد حوالي 15 كم الى الجنوب من مدائن صالح، هناك موقع كان يُسمّى قديماً «ددان» او «ديدان» بحسب ما جاء في كتب الانساب اليهوديه وفي النصوص المعينيه، ولاحقاً سُمّي بوادي القرى ويُعرف الان بالعُلا، وقد اختلف الباحثون فيمن حكم هذه المنطقه اولاً وكان الاختلاف بين الديدانيين والمعينيين واللحيانيين.\nامتد نفوذ دوله لحيان على الارض الممتده غربي النفود، من شمال يثرب الى ما يحاذي خليج العقبه.\nوقد اختلف في فتره دوله لحيان، يرى البعض انها كانت بين بدايه القرن الخامس ونهايه القرن الثالث قبل الميلاد، ويرى اخرون الى انها انما كانت فيما بين القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد (حوالي سنه 160 ق. م) وبين نهايه القرن الثالث بعد الميلاد، وهناك من حدد الفتره ما بين عامي 280 - 200 قبل الميلاد لقيامها،\nوان نهايتها كانت على ايدي الانباط الذين استولوا على «الحِجْر» سنه 65 ق. م، و«ديدان» سنه 9 ق. م،\nوان هناك من يرى ان نهايه دوله لحيان انما كانت على ايدي المعينيين، وان ذلك كان بين نهايه القرن الثالث والقرن الاول قبل الميلاد.\nعُثِر في العُلا بالقرب من مدائن صالح على ما يقارب من اربعمائه نقش لحياني اغلبها عباره عن نقوش وقطع صغيره، ومنها ما يحتوي على بعض اسماء الملوك والمعبودات الوثنيه، اما بالنسبه للكتابه اللحيانيه، فهي كتابه محليه حروفها ساميه جنوبيه وقريبه جداً من الكتابه العربيه الجنوبيه والحبشيه، اما اللهجه فعربيه شماليه وهي ايضاً ساميه جنوبيه. يرى البعض انها كانت مسيحيه، بينما يرجّح اخرون انها عربيه جاهليه وضعت قبل ظهور الاسلام.\nتحتوي هذه النقوش والكتابات على بعض اسماء ملوك لحيان، منها «هنوس بن شهر» و«ذو اسفعين تخمى بن لوذان» الذي يرجع حكمه الى النصف الاول من القرن الاول قبل الميلاد. كما ان هناك معبد يقع في العُلا يعود للحيانيين، وُجِدت فيه تماثيل بطول الانسان لملوك لحيان، وهذه التماثيل متاثره بالنحت الفرعوني في النصف الاعلى من الجسم، ومن حيث اللبس، ولكنها تحمل الطابع العربي المتمثل في شكل الوجه، وما وضع على الراس بما يشبه العمامه والعقال.\nيرى البعض ان الانباط قد استولوا على الحِجْر سنه 65 ق. م، الى ان وصلوا الى تيماء، ثم قطعوا كل اتصال للحيانيين بالبحر، فاستولوا على ميناء «لوكي كومه» التابع للحيانيين، واحاطوا بهم من جميع الجهات، ويُعتقد ان الطريق التجاري قد تغير اتجاهه بفعل النبطيين في جنوب الحجر، فكان يمر على مسافه 7 كم الى الشرق من واحه دادان القديمه، ثم اخضعوها لنفوذهم. عاد حكم اللحيانيين مره اخرى بعد سقوط البتراء على ايدي الرومان سنه 106م، والذين مدوا نفوذهم الى منطقه تبعد عشره كيلومترات الى الشمال من دادان.\n\nالانباط\nاستوطن النبط (الانباط) الحِجْر، والانباط هم من العرب من شمال شبه الجزيره العربيه. في القرن الاول قبل الميلاد، في فتره حكم الحارث الرابع جعل من الحِجْر العاصمه الثانيه للانباط حيث كانت عاصمتهم الاولى هي البتراء في الشمال، وكان للانباط حضاره كبيره وشيدوا المقابر في الجبال واضافوا لها الكثير من جماليات البناء القديم، حيث تظهر خصائص العماره النبطيه مع الكتابات النبطيه المنقوشه في الصخور على الواجهات الخاصه بهم. كما طوّروا ايضاً زراعه الواحات، وحفر الابار وعمل خزانات لمياه الامطار في الصخور، بالاضافه الى نحت اماكن العباده في النتوءات الصخريه.\nهناك منشات ومستوطنات مشابهه لما تحتويه مدائن صالح في عدد من الاماكن مثل الشام والمنطقه المجاوره للحجاز، وابرز هذه المنشات ما وجِد في البتراء.\nاستمرت حضاره الانباط في الازدهار والتوسع في الحجر حتى تحكموا في طرق التجاره في العالم القديم، حيث احتكروا تجاره البخور والمر والتوابل، وكان طريق التجاره القديم ياتي من جنوب شبه الجزيره العربيه حتى يصل الى الحِجْر، ومن الحجر يتفرع الى طريقين، يذهب احدهما الى البتراء ومصر والشام، فيما يذهب الاخر الى تيماء ثم تدمر في العراق. كما كانت الحجر مركزاً رئيسياً لطرق القوافل القديمه وكانت تتحكم في طرق القوافل، وبلغ نفوذهم كما يذكر المؤرخون شرق شبه الجزيره العربيه وجنوبها، وعندما خشي الرومان على نفوذهم وعلى دولتهم من هذه المملكه الجديده قام الرومان بشن حرب كبيره على الانباط واستطاع الرومان هزيمتهم في الحجر سنه 106م، ولكنهم لم يستوطنوا الحجر بل عادوا الى الشام، وهكذا تدمرت حضاره الانباط في الحجر ولم يعد لهم اي ذكر، وظلت الحجر مهجوره زمناً طويلاً.\n\nفتره ما بعد الانباط\nفي سنه 106م تم ضم مملكه الانباط من قبل الامبراطوريه الرومانيه. وبالتالي اصبح جزء من الحجاز والذي يشمل الحجر تحت ادارتهم.\nمؤخراً تم اكتشاف نقش روماني في الحجر يعود الى 175 - 177م.\nتحول طريق التجاره من كونه مساراً بريّاً يصل بين شمال شبه الجزيره العربيه وجنوبها الى ان اصبح مساراً بحريّاً وذلك عبر البحر الاحمر، مما ادّى الى انخفاض اهميتها التجاريّه بعد ان كانت مركزاً للتجاره، الى ان تمّ التخلي عنها لاحقاً. هناك دراسات اثريه افترضت ان الموقع قد فقد وظائفه الحضريه في بدايات اواخر العصور القديمه، ويعود ذلك الى عمليه التصحر في المنطقه.\nمؤخراً تم اكتشاف ادله على ان الفيالق الرومانيه في عهد تراجان سيطرت على مدائن صالح، لزياده نفوذها في المقاطعه العربيه.\n\nيبقى تاريخ الحجر منذ انهيار الامبراطوريه الرومانيه حتى ظهور الاسلام غير معروف، في سنه 9 هـ الموافقه لسنه 630م مر عليها النبي محمد اثناء توجهه لغزوه تبوك. بعد ظهور الاسلام وانتشاره عادت الحركه الى الحجر، كما تم ذكرها في القرون اللاحقه من قِبَل المسافرين والحجاج في طريقهم الى مكه، حيث كانت الحجر تخدم كمحطه للاستراحه بها والتزوّد بالماء والطعام، وقد ذكرها العديد من الرحاله العرب كالمقدسي وياقوت الحموي وابراهيم بن شجاع، وابن بطوطه الذي اشار في القرن الرابع عشر الميلادي الى الصخور والاضرحه الموجوده فيها، ولكنّه لم يشر الى الانشطه البشريه هناك.\nتحت الحكم العثماني والذي بدا في القرن السادس عشر، تم بناء حصن فيها في الفتره ما بين 1744 - 1757م، والذي كان ذلك جزءاً لسلسله من التحصينات تم بناؤها من اجل حمايه طريق الحج الى مكه.\n\nالمدائن في القرن العشرين\nمنذ القرن التاسع عشر استُخدِمت الابار القائمه لزراعه المنطقه بشكل دوري من قبل المستوطنين في تيماء المجاوره لها، واستمر هذا حتى القرن العشرين، عندما تم بناء سكه حديد الحجاز (1901 - 1908م) التي كانت تمرّ من خلال الموقع بامرٍ من السلطان العثماني عبد الحميد الثاني، لربط دمشق والقدس في الشمال الغربي بالمدينه المنوره، لتسهيل رحله الحج، بالاضافه الى امور سياسيه واقتصاديه لتعزيز الاداره العثمانيه على مراكز العقيده الاسلاميه. بُنِيت محطه مدائن صالح شمال الحجر، وقد عملت على زياده امكانيه الوصول للموقع. لاحقاً تم تدمير السكه من قِبل الانجليز خلال الثوره العربيه اثناء الحرب العالميه الاولى.\nاستمرت عده دراسات اثريه في الموقع للفتره منذ بدايه الحرب العالميه الاولى الى توحيد المملكه العربيه السعوديه في 1932، الى ان وصلت الى الستينيات الميلاديه. لاحقاً تم ترميم محطه سكه الحديد، وتتكون من 16 مبنى موزعاً على خط السكه بطول 400 متر تقريباً، وتضم مباني للاداره والمخازن ومركزاً للشرطه ومركزاً صحياً واقامه للعاملين في المحطه واستراحات للزوار، كما تتضمن محطه لصيانه القاطرات وورشه للصيانه ومخازن الحطب والطاقه.\nبحلول نهايه فتره الستينيات الميلاديه عملت الحكومه السعوديه برنامجاً لتحسين اسلوب حياه قبائل البدو الرحل التي تقطن المنطقه. وكان البرنامج يقترح استقرارهم في المنطقه مع اعاده استخدام الابار الموجوده والاشتغال بالزراعه، ولكن مع اكتساب الموقع هويته الرسميه كموقع اثري سنه 1972 ادّى الى توطين البدو نحو الشمال خارج حدود الموقع، وشمل ذلك تطوير الاراضي الزراعيه الجديده والابار التي حفرت حديثاً، للحفاظ على المنطقه.\n\nالحِجْر في الاسلام\nقوم ثمود في القران\nالثموديون هم اول من سكن الحجر واول من نحت المنازل في الصخور وجاء بعدهم الانباط. جاء ذكر الحِجْر وقصه قوم ثمود في القران في اكثر من سوره، حيث يذكر ان الثموديين تميّزوا بالقوه وكانوا يتخذون من الجبال بيوتاً عن طريق النّحت، فقد ورد في القران ﴿وَثَمُودَ الَّذِينَ جَابُوا الصَّخْرَ بِالْوَادِ ۝٩﴾ [الفجر:9]، وارسل الله اليهم نبيّه صالح، حيث دعاهم الى عباده الله وترك عباده الاصنام ولكنهم لم يؤمنوا به، ومع استمرار دعوته لهم، طلبوا منه ان يخرج لهم ناقه من صخره كبيره لديهم، وانهم سوف يؤمنون اذا نفّذ هذا الامر، فدعا الله ان يُخرج الناقه واستجاب الله له.\n﴿وَاِلَىٰ ثَمُودَ اَخَاهُمْ صَالِحًا ۗ قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ اِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ ۖ قَدْ جَاءَتْكُم بَيِّنَهٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ ۖ هَٰذِهِ نَاقَهُ اللَّهِ لَكُمْ ايَهً ۖ فَذَرُوهَا تَاْكُلْ فِي اَرْضِ اللَّهِ ۖ وَلَا تَمَسُّوهَا بِسُوءٍ فَيَاْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابٌ اَلِيمٌ﴾ (سوره الاعراف، الايه: 73)\nفاستجابوا لدعوه نبي الله صالح، ثم ارتدوا عن دينهم وعقروا الناقه التي ارسلها الله لهم ايه وتحدَّوه ان ياتيهم بالعذاب فاهلكهم الله بالصيحه، وكانت الناقه في يوم تشرب جميع الماء الموجود في البئر، وتسقي في اليوم التالي كل سكان الحجر من لبنها، وبعد مده من الزمن قرر قوم ثمود قتل الناقه، وعندما قتلوها اهلكهم الله جميعاً بالصيحه، ونجا نبيّه صالح ومن امن معه من قوم ثمود، ومن ثمّ رحل صالح ومن معه من المؤمنين الى مكه المكرمه.\nمن الايات التي ذكرت في القران عن الحِجْر:\n\n﴿وَلَقَدْ كَذَّبَ اَصْحَابُ الْحِجْرِ الْمُرْسَلِينَ ۝٨٠ وَاتَيْنَاهُمْ ايَاتِنَا فَكَانُوا عَنْهَا مُعْرِضِينَ ۝٨١ وَكَانُوا يَنْحِتُونَ مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا امِنِينَ ۝٨٢ فَاَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّيْحَهُ مُصْبِحِينَ ۝٨٣ فَمَا اَغْنَى عَنْهُمْ مَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ ۝٨٤﴾ (سوره الحجر، الايه: 80 - 84)\n﴿كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ الْمُرْسَلِينَ، اِذْ قَالَ لَهُمْ اَخُوهُمْ صَالِحٌ اَلَا تَتَّقُونَ، اِنِّي لَكُمْ رَسُولٌ اَمِينٌ، فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاَطِيعُونِ، وَمَا اَسْاَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ اَجْرٍ اِنْ اَجْرِيَ اِلَّا عَلَى رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ، اَتُتْرَكُونَ فِي مَا هَاهُنَا امِنِينَ، فِي جَنَّاتٍ وَعُيُونٍ، وَزُرُوعٍ وَنَخْلٍ طَلْعُهَا هَضِيمٌ، وَتَنْحِتُونَ مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا فَارِهِينَ، فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاَطِيعُونِ، وَلَا تُطِيعُوا اَمْرَ الْمُسْرِفِينَ، الَّذِينَ يُفْسِدُونَ فِي الْاَرْضِ وَلَا يُصْلِحُونَ، قَالُوا اِنَّمَا اَنْتَ مِنَ

فَيَاْخُذَكُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ، فَعَقَرُوهَا فَاَصْبَحُوا نَادِمِينَ، فَاَخَذَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ اِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَايَهً وَمَا كَانَ اَكْثَرُهُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ، وَاِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ﴾ (سوره الشعراء، الايه: 141 - 159)\n\nفي السُّنَّه\nعن عبد الله بن عمر قال: «لما نزل رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم بالناس على تبوك نزل بهم الحِجْر عند بيوت ثمود، فاستقى الناس من الابار التي كانت تشرب منها ثمود، فعجنوا منها ونصبوا القدور فامرهم رسول الله فاهرقوا القدور، وعلفوا العجين الابل، ثم ارتحل بهم حتى نزل بهم على البئر التي كانت تشرب منها الناقه، ونهاهم ان يدخلوا على القوم الذين عذبوا، وقال: اني اخشى ان يصيبكم مثل ما اصابهم فلا تدخلوا عليهم».\nعن عبد الله بن عمر قال: «قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم وهو بالحِجْر: لا تدخلوا على هؤلاء المعذبين الا ان تكونوا باكين، فان لم تكونوا باكين فلا تدخلوا عليهم ان يصيبكم مثل ما اصابهم». وفي بعض الروايات «ان النبي محمد لما مَرَّ بمنازلهم قنع راسه، واسرع راحلته، ونهى عن دخول منازلهم الا ان تكونوا باكين». وفي روايه: «فان لم تبكوا فتباكوا، خشيه ان يصيبكم مثل ما اصابهم».\nعن عمرو بن سعد (وقيل: عامر بن سعد) قال: «لما كان في غزوه تبوك، فسارع الناس الى اهل الحجر يدخلون عليهم، فبلغ ذلك رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، فنادى في الناس: الصلاه جامعه. قال: فاتيت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، وهو ممسك بعيره، وهو يقول: ما تدخلون على قوم غضب الله عليهم؟ فناداه رجل: نعجب منهم يا رسول الله. قال: افلا انبئكم باعجب من ذلك؟ رجل من انفسكم ينبئكم بما كان قبلكم، وما هو كائن بعدكم فاستقيموا وسددوا، فان الله لا يعبا بعذابكم شيئاً، وسياتي قوم لا يدفعون عن انفسهم بشيء».\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع مدائن صالح على بعد 22 كم شمال شرق مدينه العلا، و400 كم شمال غرب المدينه المنوره و500 كم الى الجنوب الشرقي من البتراء الواقعه في الاردن، وتقع تحديداً عند دائره عرض 47 ـ 26 شمالاً، وخط طول 53 ـ 37 شرقاً. يقع الموقع الاثري على منطقه سهليه، عند سفح هضبه من البازلت التي تشكل الجزء الجنوبي الشرقي من جبال الحجاز. الاجزاء الغربيه والشماليه الغربيه للموقع، تحتوي على المياه الجوفيه التي يمكن الوصول اليها على عمق 20 متراً تقريباً. يتميز الموقع بطبيعته الصحراويه التي تتسم بالنتوءات الواقعه على الصخور بمختلف الاحجام والارتفاعات.\nتتميز منطقه مدائن صالح بالتكوينات الصخريه، كما انها تتميز ايضاً بتنوّع الوان صخورها الرمليه بين الاحمر والاصفر والابيض. بالاضافه الى ان الموقع محاط بالكثبان الرمليه من جميع الجهات.\n\nالعماره\nالنحت\nتتميّز المدافن النبطيه في مدائن صالح كونها ليست مبنيه وانما محفوره في الصخور الرمليه، والذي ساهم في سهوله عمليه النحت والحفر، كون تلك الصخور غير صلبه ولكنها تتاثر بعوامل التعريه. تتباين الوان الصخور من الاحمر الى الابيض حسب عمرها، حيث يعود تاريخ الصخور الحمراء الى العصر الكمبري، بينما تعود الصخور البيضاء الى العصر الاردوفيشي، وتتطابق هذه الصخور مع تلك التي استخدمها الانباط في البتراء، وهناك عده تحليلات قام بها خبراء في علم الاثار لتفسير اسلوب النحت المتبع فراوا ان العمليه تمت من الاعلى الى الاسفل، وبما ان اصحاب تلك المدافن من الطبقه الحاكمه او من اثرياء الانباط، فكانت هنالك معايير قبل عمليه النحت، حيث يتم اختيار موقع المدفن فكلما كان قريباً من ناحيه المساكن كان اكثر تكلفه ويقل كلما تباعد عنها، وارتفاع الصخره وجودتها كانت من تلك المعايير ايضاً، فالصخور التي تخلو من الصدوع والشقوق تعمل على ابراز تفاصيل النقوش كالشرفات المدرّجه التي تعرف بسلّم الغراب، والكورنيش على النمط المصري والعتب وتيجان الاعمده التي يتم نحتها على الصخور الجيده، ولكن احياناً يتعذّر على النحات معرفه جوده الصخره في البدايه ليتم اكتشافها لاحقاً اثناء النحت، كما يتم تحديد ارتفاع المدفن بشكل دقيق وذلك بحسب الادوات المتوفره لديهم، وعندما لا تكون هنالك طبقه طبيعيه ناتئه في الصخر يتم نحت قناه افقيه في الصخره فوق اعلى نقطه في الواجهه المنحوته، لتمنع من تساقط الامطار على الواجهه،\nهناك تناسب بين طول واجهه المدفن وعرضه حيث ان ارتفاع المدفن يتحدد بناءً على عرضه، وبالنسبه للمدافن الكبيره فكان يعمل عليها عدد من النحاتين سواءً كانوا اثنان او اكثر من ذلك، فيعمل كل واحد في طرف بحيث يتم الالتقاء في منتصف الواجهه، وتختلف كميه الصخور التي يتم نحتها قبل الوصول للواجهه من مدفن الى اخر، وكان النحاتون يستعملون المنصات الطبيعيه المتكونه نتيجه اختلاف مستوى طبقات التكوين الصخري ليقفوا عليها، وعادهً ما يقوم النحّات بالانتهاء من جميع تنفيذ جميع تفاصيل النحت التي تتم في الواجهه من زخارف قبل النزول للاسفل، كما يتم اعداد اللوحه التي يُكتب عليها النص التاسيس ويتم عاده قطعها فوق المدفن، ولكن الكتابه غالباً ما تتم من قِبل كاتب مختص، ويشترك العمّال في تنفيذ اعمال النحت تحت اشراف رئيس النحاتين واحياناً اثنان من النحاتين ترِد اسماؤهم تحت النص التاسيسي للمدفن، وهناك مجموعه من النحاتين ينتسبون لعائله واحده ظهر ذلك من خلال كتابه اسمائهم على عدد من اللوحات، ومن اشهرهم شخص اسمه «افتح» حيث قام بتنفيذ خمسه مدافن وساهم في اثنين اخرين. هناك بعض العناصر التي عُملت على الواجهه تمت من قبل اشخاص مختصين بذلك ويتم تنفيذ تلك العناصر سواء بشكل مباشر على الصخره او بنحتها بشكل منفصل ومن ثم الحاقها بالمكان المخصص لها في الواجهه. يتم عمل الاسطح الملساء التي تتميز بها الواجهات راسياً بواسطه معول مستدق الراس من الطرفين او الازميل وهو وتد حديدي مدبب من احد الطرفين ومسطح في الاخر يتم العمل به عن طريق طرقه بمطرقه.\n\nهناك اجزاء من الواجهه مثل المساحه بين الشرفات والعتب والعارضه اسفل تاج العمود يتم تجصيصها ودهنها بلون اسود او احمر، حيث ان هناك عدد من المدافن لا تزال تحتفظ باثار الجص المستخدم. كان النحاتون يستخدمون بالاضافه الى ادوات النحت والحفر ادوات القياس، ومنها مقياس الخط العمودي، وشاقول تحديد الاستواء، والمربع، والحبل، واحياناً الفرجار. هناك عدد من المدافن غير المكتمله في الموقع، ويعود معظمها لنواحٍ فنيه على ما يبدو، امّا ان يكون بسبب ان النحات قد واجه طبقه ملحيه اتت من سطح الارض، واما ان يكون بسبب شق في الصخره لم يظهر في بدايه العمل بالنحت، او ظهور طبقه تحتوي على الكثير من الحصى.\nالعنصر الاخر في المدفن هو حُجره الدفن ويتم حفرها في الصخره خلف الواجهه، وحجرات الدفن لا تكون عاده بنفس مستوى ارتفاع الواجهات، ومستوى سقف الغرفه يكون متوافقاً مع العتبه العليا للباب، والاداه الوحيده المستخدمه داخل المدافن كانت المعول مستدق الطرفين، ويوجد عدد من حجرات المدافن غير المكتمله، وربما يعود ذلك كون صاحب المدفن يهتم بالواجهه الخارجيه اكثر من الحجره الداخليه، ومكان الدفن المنحوت داخل الحجره يتكوّن من ثلاثه انواع، كوّه او حفره او حجره مصمته، وكان ينفذ عندما يتوفى احد افراد العائله، وحين يكون المكان في شكل حجره فهي تُحفر بحسب حجم الشخص المتوفّى، وعاده ما تكون حجرات الدفن غير منتظمه.\nقام الباحث جان كلود بيساك بتقدير الفتره المطلوبه لتنفيذ مدفن متوسط الحجم بسنه وشهرين، وتستغرق عمليه حفر الواجهه المده الاطول التي قد تستغرق سبعه اشهر، اما حجره المدفن فتستغرق ما بين اربعه الى خمسه اشهر وهي تقريباً نفس المده التي تتطلبها عمليه نحت التفاصيل.\n\nالكتابات والنقوش\nتتنوع الكتابات الموجوده في مدائن صالح، فهناك العربيه الجنوبيه، واللحيانيه، والثموديه، والنبطيه، واللاتينيه، والاسلاميه. كما ان مواضيع هذه النقوش تتنوع بين النقوش الدينيه والنقوش التاسيسيه والنقوش التذكاريه، اما اكثر النقوش الموجوده في الموقع فهي النقوش الملكيه. تنتشر في الموقع النقوش النبطيه كون الموقع وصل لاوج ازدهاره فتره العصر النبطي، وهي تنتشر على واجهات الجبال، وكذلك في اماكن على واجهات المقابر، وقد تضمنت معلومات عن ملكيه المقبره، وما تحتويه من شروط للدفن فيها من قبل اصحابها وورثتهم، كما انها تحتوي ايضاً على نصوص يتم فيها تحديد العقوبه التي يجب ان تقع على من يخالف قانون الدفن، وبعض النقوش مؤرخه كما تحتوي على اسم النحّات.\n\nالمواقع الاثريه\nواجهات المقابر المنحوته\nمدافن جبل المحجر\nتعرف مجموعه مدافن جبل المحجر كذلك باسم (المنطقه ا)، وتقع الى الشمال من مجموعه مدافن قصر البنت بالقرب من البئر النبطي، وهي عباره عن ثلاث كُتَل صخريه نُحِتت فيها اربعه عشر مدفناً نبطيّاً، حيث تضم الكتله الصخريه الاولى منها سته مدافن، وتضم الثانيه خمسه مدافن، بينما تضم الثالثه والمسماه بجبل المحجر ثلاثه مدافن.\n\nمدافن قصر البنت\nتعرف مجموعه مدافن قصر البنت ايضاً باسم (المنطقه ب)، وتقع الى الغرب من جبل اثلب، وتتكون من جبلين احدهما كبير حيث يمتد من الشمال الى الجنوب ويضم 31 مدفناً، والاخر صغير يقع شمال غربي الجبل الاول ويضم مدفنين في واجهته الشرقيه.\n\nمدافن الجبل الاحمر\nتعرف مجموعه مدافن الجبل الاحمر ايضاً باسم (المنطقه ج)، وتقع الى الجنوب الغربي من مجموعه مدافن قصر البنت، والى الشمال الغربي من منطقه «د»، وتضم كتلتين صخريتين، تحتوي الاولى على 18 مدفناً. بينما تتكون الكتله الثانيه من مدفن واحد فقط، وهي تقع جنوب الكتله الاولى.\n\nمدافن المنطقه «د»\nتقع المنطقه «د» شرق منطقه قصر الصانع، حيث تتكون من جبلين في كل واحد منهما مقبره واحده فقط. في المدفن (رقم: 109) يظهر بان العمل قد اكتمل في الغرفه الخاصه بالدفن، بينما الجزء السفلي من واجهه المدفن غير مكتمله. بالنسبه للمدفن (رقم: 111) يظهر بان واجهته قد اكتملت، بينما غرفه الدفن غير مكتمله.\n\nمدافن الخريمات\nتقع منطقه الخريمات جنوب غربي الحِجْر، وتحتوي على 53 مدفناً موزعه على تسعه جبال، وتتميز واجهات المدافن بتعدد العناصر المعماريه والزخرفيه، كما ان المنطقه تاثرت بعوامل التعريه والسيول بسبب انخفاض المنطقه. الجبل الاول يضم خمسه مدافن (رقم: 50 - 54)، بينما يضم الجبل الثاني مدفناً وحيداً (رقم: 49)، وكذلك الجبل الثالث الذي يضم مدفناً واحداً (رقم:55)، اما الجبل الرابع فيضم سبعه مدافن (رقم: 56 - 62)، وبالنسبه للجبل الخامس فهو يضم سته عشر مدفناً (رقم: 63 - 78)، والجبل السادس يضم مدفناً واحداً (رقم: 79)، بالاضافه الى الجبل السابع الذي يضم سته عشر مدفناً (رقم: 80 - 95)، والجبل الثامن يضم خمسه مدافن (رقم: 96 - 100)، والجبل التاسع يضم مدفناً واحداً (رقم: 101).\n\nقصر الصانع\nتقع مجموعه قصر الصانع في الجهه الجنوبيه من منطقه الحِجْر، وتتكون من كتلتين صخريتين. الكتله الغربيه تضم مدفناً واحداً يُعرف بقصر الصانع، حيث ان واجهته تعلوها شرفات مدرّجه في اسفلها كورنيش ثم شريط فاصل ثم كورنيش اخر يبرز بشكل اقل عن سابقه، تليه عارضتان يقع بينهما شريط فاصل، وتقع العارضه السفلى على عمودين ذات تيجان نبطيه، ويتوسط المدخل الجزء الجنوبي من الواجهه، وعلى جانبه عمودان تيجانهما نبطيه. بينما الكتله الشرقيه تحتوي على سته مدافن وهي بسيطه في نحتها.\n\nقصر الفريد\nسمي بالقصر الفريد كونه يقع منفرداً في كتله صخريه مستقله، ولتميّزه معماريّاً حيث يتفرّد بوجود عمودين نبطيّين بوسط الجزء السفلي في واجهته الصخريه بالاضافه الى الاعمده الجانبيه، ولكن المدفن غير مكتمل وخاصه في جزء الواجهه السفلي والبرحه الاماميه للمدخل، والنقش التاسيسي للمدفن غير مؤرخ.\nتوجد اعلى واجهه المدفن شرفات مدرّجه على الجانبين في اسفلها كورنيش ثم شريط فاصل ثم كورنيش اخر يحتوي على بروز اقل من السابق تليه عارضه، وعلى جانبه عمودين بتيجان نبطيه، بالاضافه الى عمودين اخرين في وسط الواجهه وهو الذي ميّزها عن باقي المدافن، ويتوسط المدخل الجزء السفلي من الواجهه، ومن عناصره المكتمله الاطار العام لكورنيش يظهر اعلاه نحت لنسر فارد جناحيه، بالاضافه الى منحوتات لانيه تظهر على جانبي الكورنيش، كما يعلوه نقش تاسيسي نصّه «لحيان بن كوزا وذريته».\n\nمدافن المنطقه السكنيه\nتقع مدافن المنطقه السكنيه ضمن المنطقه السهليه التي تتوسط الموقع، ويحيط بها سور له اثار باقيه من الجهات الشماليه والجنوبيه والغربيه، تتوسطها رموز دينيه بارزه.\n\nالمنطقه الدينيه\nتقع المنطقه الدينيه في الجهه الشماليه للحِجْر وتحديداً في جبال اثلب، وكان قد اتخذها الانباط مركزاً دينيّاً لهم، وتتكوّن المنطقه من الديوان والمعابد والمحاريب وقصر العجوز. يعتبر الديوان من اهم المنشات الدينيه فيها، وهو مكان مخصص للتجمعات الدينيه، ويتكوّن من حجره في الجبل وهي مستطيله الشكل، كما ان مدخل الديوان مفتوح وعلى جانبه عمودان ذوا تيجان نبطيّه تعلوهما عارضه، وتوجد بالديوان ثلاث دكات منحوته ومتصله ببعضها وهي ترتفع عن سطح الارض ويتم الصعود اليها عن طريق درج منحوت في جانبي المدخل، كما ان هناك اربعه اعمده تيجانها نبطيه يعلوها افريز بارز وهي تقع في اركان الديوان، وهناك ممر ضيق مجاور للديوان يعرف بـ «السيق»، حيث تنتشر على جانبيه النقوش والمحاريب.\nتنتشر المعابد على مرتفعات جبل اثلب في منطقه الديوان وفي بطن منطقه المنخض الصخري، وهي تمثل المنطقه الدينيه التي انشئت للمعبودات الوثنيه الخاصه باهل الحِجْر. بالنسبه لقصر العجوز فهو معبد او مركز للكهنه يقع الى الجنوب من جبل اثلب، يتميز بكون مدخله مفتوح بحجم اتساع الحجره المنحوته، يوجد في الجدار الايمن للحجره كوَّتان مربعتان، بينما يوجد في الجدار الاخر خمس كوَّات، في يمينها مدخل يصل بحُجره صغيره.\nتتركز المحاريب في جنوب المنطقه الدينيه، وهي من الامور الدينيه التي تتميز بها حضاره الانباط، حيث تُجسّد فيها رموز معبوداتهم الوثنيه، وقد حُفرت المحاريب في صخور تختلف في اشكالها واحجامها، وهذه المحاريب عباره عن تجاويب يتقدمها عمودان يحملان قوساً نصف دائري، في وسط كل محراب او اعلاه نحت بارز يرمز للمعبودات الوثنيه، وقد يكون بعض هذه المحاريب لا يحتوي على اي رموز.\n\nالمنطقه السكنيه\nتقع المنطقه السكنيه في وسط منطقه الحِجْر، في ارض سهليه منبسطه، وقد تم تحديد اسوار تحيط بها من ثلاث جهات، كما كشفت الحفائر عن عدد من المراحل المعماريه التي قامت عليها، مما يدل على عُمق الاستيطان بالمنطقه، حيث تم الكشف عن وحدات معماريه ومبان طينيه فوق اساسات حجريّه قامت عليها، وكانت تلك الاحجار تقطع من جبل المحجر وغيره من الجبال المجاوره، وبالاضافه الى الاساسات فقد كانت الاحجار تستخدم في الاحواض الحجريه والاعمده وتيجانها. تم العثور في المنطقه السكنيه على العديد من الاشياء كالعملات والفخاريات والمساجر والمجامر والدمى وغيرها من الاشياء التي اُرِّخَت في الفتره النبطيه.\n\nالابار والقنوات المائيه\nتوجد بالموقع مجموعه من الابار والقنوات المائيه، حيث عُثر على اكثر من ستين بئرا محفوره في الصخر، بعضها يصل عمقه لاكثر من ثلاثين متراً، وهي تتمثل بابار دائريه المقطع يضيق قطرها من الاسفل وبعضها مطوي، فقد عُرِف عن الانباط عنايتهم بالمياه وحفظها والتحكم بها عن طريق شبكه هندسيه دقيقه، وقد ظل بعض هذه الابار مستخدماً الى وقتٍ قريب. اما فيما يتعلق بقنوات المياه فقد تم الكشف عن جزء منها، وهي مبنيه من الحجر يتصل بعضها بصهاريج كانت تستخدم في تخزين المياه والتي هي الاخرى مبنيه من الحجر ومبنيه تحت الارض، وبعض هذه الصهاريج يحتوي على فتحات لاستخراج المياه.\n\nالبئر النبطيه\nالبئر النبطيه عباره عن بئر عميقه تقع قرب جبل المحجر ومجموعه القبور الموجوده حوله، وهي واحده من خمسه وستين بئراً اكتشفت بالموقع، وكان قد استخدمها الانباط في ري مزروعاتهم وسقياهم. حالياً البئر محاطه بسياج معدني يمنع النزول اليها، وهناك مجرى محفور في الصخور الواقعه في الجبل كان يستخدم في توجيه المياه من الجبل الى البئر.\n\nمدافن الرجوم الركاميه\nهنالك مدافن على شكل رجم من الحجاره يتراوح عرضه ما بين متر ونصف الى عشره امتار، بينما يصل ارتفاع بعضها الى المتر، تحتوي بعضها على دعامات بشكل سرداب. معظم هذه المدافن تقع على قمم التكوينات الصخريه الممتده في الاجزاء الجنوبيه والغربيه من مدائن صالح، وقد تم تسجيل اكثر من 325 موقعاً. في 2008م اجريت حفريات اثريه للمدافن، حيث كانت قبل عمليه الحفر تبدو كرجم من الحجاره بعرض سبعه امتار وارتفاع متر، وبعد الحفر ظهر بان هيكل المدفن عباره عن مقبره تتخذ شكل برج قطره 7,30 م يتكون من وحدتين بينهما فاصل بطول 1,90 م مليء بكتل حجريه، ويبدو ان المدفن يعود الى الالف الثاني او الثالث قبل الميلاد، حيث انه يختلف عن الاسلوب النبطي، ويرجح انه يرتبط بحضاره اخرى.\n\nطريق الحج الشامي\nفي العهد العثماني وفي سبيل حمايه قوافل الحجاج تم انشاء عده قلاع على امتداد الطريق المؤدي الى بلاد الشام، منها قلعه الحجر العثمانيه في مدائن صالح، وهي عباره عن مبنى مربّع الشكل مكوّن من طابقين، في شمالها يوجد المدخل ويعلوه برج للمراقبه، وهذا المدخل يؤدي الى فناء داخلي يتوسطه بئر مطوي، وتتوزع حوله الغرف في جهاته الاربع، كما ان هناك مُصلّى صغير يقع في جنوب الفناء. في الطابق العلوي هناك ابراج تتوزع في اركان القلعه، كما

          "content": "Hegra (Ancient Greek: Ἕγρα, Arabic: ٱلْحِجْر‎, romanized: al-Ḥijr), also known as Madaʾin Salih (Arabic: مَدَائِن صَالِح‎, romanized: Madāʾin Ṣāliḥ, lit. 'Cities of Salih'), is an archaeological site located in the area of Al-'Ula within Medina Province in the Hejaz region, Saudi Arabia. \nA majority of the remains date from the Nabataean Kingdom (1st century AD). The site constituted the kingdom's southernmost and second largest city after Petra (modern-day Jordan), its capital city. Traces of Lihyanite and Roman occupation before and after the Nabataean rule, respectively, can also be found. The site features more than 110 well-preserved Nabataean tombs carved into sandstone outcrops.\nThe archaeological site lies in an arid environment. The dry climate, the lack of resettlement after the site was abandoned, and the prevailing local beliefs about the locality have all led to the extraordinary state of preservation of Al-Hijr, providing an extensive picture of the Nabataean lifestyle. Thought to mark the southern extent of the Nabataean kingdom, Al-Hijr's oasis agriculture and extant wells exhibit the necessary adaptations made by the Nabataeans in the given environment—its markedly distinct settlement is the second largest among the Nabataean kingdom, complementing that of the more famous Petra archaeological site in Jordan. The location of the site at the crossroads of trade, and the various languages, scripts and artistic styles reflected in the façades of its monumental tombs further set it apart from other archaeological sites. It has duly earned the nickname \"The Capital of Monuments\" among Saudi Arabia's 4,000 archaeological sites.\nThe Quran places the settlement of the area by the Thamudi people during the days of the prophet Salih, between those of Nuh (Noah) and Hud on one hand, and those of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses) on the other. However, a definitive historical chronology can not be obtained through the order of verses because the Quranic chapters (see surah) deal with different subjects in non-chronologic order. According to the Quran, the Thamudis were punished by God for their idolatry, struck by an earthquake and lightning blasts. Thus, the site has earned a reputation as a cursed place—an image which the national government is attempting to overcome as it seeks to develop Mada'in Salih for its potential for tourism.\nIn 2008, UNESCO proclaimed Mada'in Salih as a site of patrimony, becoming Saudi Arabia's first World Heritage Site. It was chosen for its well-preserved remains from late antiquity, especially the 131 monumental rock-cut tombs, with their elaborately ornamented façades, of the Nabataean Kingdom.\n\nLocation\nThe archaeological site of Hegra is situated 20 km (12 mi) north of the town of Al-'Ula, 400 km (250 miles) northwest of Medina, and 500 km (310 miles) southeast of Petra, Jordan. Istakhri wrote in his Routes of the Realms (مسالك الممالك‎):\n\nAl-Hijr is a small village. It belongs to Wadi al Gura and is located at one day's travel inside the mountains. It was the homeland of the Thamudians. I have seen those mountains and their carvings. Their houses are similar to ours but are carved in the mountains, which are called the Ithlib mountains. It looks as if they are a continuous range but they are separated and have sand dunes around them. You can reach the top of the mountains, but this is extremely tiring. The well of the Thamudians which is mentioned in the Holy Quran is located in the middle of the mountains.\nThe site is on a plain at the foot of a basalt plateau that forms a portion of the Hijaz Mountains. Beneath the western and northwestern parts of the site, the water table can be reached at a depth of 20 metres (66 ft). The setting is notable for its desert landscape, marked by sandstone outcroppings of various sizes and heights.\n\nHistory\nName\nIts long history and the multitude of cultures occupying the site have produced several names. References by Strabo and other Mediterranean writers use the name Hegra (Ancient Greek: Ἔγρα) for the Nabataean site. The use of Mada'in Salih refers to the (Prophet) Salih, sent to ancient Arabs, a name and identity which may be derived from the biblical figure Methuselah (Hebrew: מְתוּשֶׁלַח‎, romanized: Məṯūšélaḥ, in pausa מְתוּשָׁלַח‎ Məṯūšālaḥ \"Man of the javelin\" or \"Death of Sword\"; Greek: Μαθουσάλας, romanized: Mathousálas).\n\nAlthough Hegra was for a long time not as important as Dedan, foreigners appear to have called the oasis Hegra. For example, the famous statue of the Achaemenid king Darius the Great made in Egypt and erected in Susa calls the Arabs hgr.\n\nRock writings\nRecent archaeological work has revealed numerous rock writings and pictures not only on Mount Athleb, but also throughout central Arabia. They date between the sixth century BC and the fourth century AD and are labelled as being Thamudic, a name invented by nineteenth-century scholars for these large numbers of inscriptions which had not yet been properly studied.\n\nLihyan/Dedanite era\nArchaeological traces of cave art on the sandstones and epigraphs (inscriptions), considered by experts to be Lihyanite script, on top of the Athleb Mountain, near Hegra (Madaʾin Salih), have been dated to the 3rd–2nd century BC, indicating the early human settlement of the area, which has an accessible source of freshwater and fertile soil. The settlement of the Lihyans became a centre of commerce, with goods from the east, north and south converging in the locality.\n\nNabataean era\nThe extensive settlement of the site took place during the 1st century AD, when it came under the rule of the Nabataean king Aretas IV Philopatris (Al-Harith IV) (9 BC – 40 AD), who made Hegra (Madaʾin Salih) the kingdom's second capital, after Petra in the north. The place enjoyed a huge urbanization movement, turning it into a city. Characteristic of Nabateaan rock-cut architecture, the geology of Hegra (Madaʾin Salih) provided the perfect medium for the carving of monumental structures, with Nabataean scripts inscribed on their façades. \nThe Nabataeans also developed oasis agriculture—digging wells and rainwater tanks in the rock and carving places of worship in the sandstone outcroppings. Similar structures were featured in other Nabataean settlements, ranging from southern Syria (region) to the north, going south to the Negev, and down to the immediate area of the Hejaz. The most prominent and the largest of these is Petra.\nAt the crossroad of commerce, the Nabataean kingdom flourished, holding a monopoly for the trade of incense, myrrh and spices. Situated on the overland caravan route and connected to the Red Sea port of Egra Kome, Hegra, as it was known among the Nabataeans, reached its peak as the major staging post on the main north–south trade route.\n\nRoman era\nIn 106 AD, the Nabataean kingdom was annexed by the contemporary Roman Empire. The Hejaz, which encompasses Hegra, became part of the Roman province of Arabia.\n\nThe Hedjaz region was integrated into the Roman province of Arabia in 106 AD. A monumental Roman epigraph of 175–177 AD was recently discovered at al-Hijr (then called \"Hijr\" and now Mada'in Salih).\n\nThe trading itinerary shifted from the overland north–south axis on the Arabian Peninsula to the maritime route through the Red Sea. Thus, Hegra as a centre of trade began to decline, leading to its abandonment. Supported by the lack of later developments based on archaeological studies, experts have hypothesized that the site had lost all of its urban functions beginning in late antiquity (mainly due to the process of desertification). In the 1960s and 1970s, evidence was discovered that the Roman legions of Trajan occupied Mada'in Salih in northeastern Arabia, increasing the extension of the Arabia Petraea province of the Romans in Arabia.\nThe history of Hegra during the period from the decline of the Roman Empire until the emergence of Islam remains unknown. It was only sporadically mentioned by travellers and pilgrims making their way to Mecca in the succeeding centuries. Hegra served as a station along the Hajj route, providing supplies and water for pilgrims. Among the accounts is a description made by 14th-century traveller Ibn Battuta, noting the red stone-cut tombs of Hegra, by then known as \"al-Hijr\". However, he made no mention of human activities there.\n\nOttoman era\nThe Ottoman Empire annexed western Arabia from the Mamluks by 1517. In early Ottoman accounts of the Hajj road between Damascus and Mecca, Hegra (Madaʾin Salih) is not mentioned, until 1672, when the Turkish traveller, Evliya Celebi noted that the caravan passed through a place called \"Abyar Salih\" where there were the remains of seven cities. It is again mentioned by the traveller Murtada ibn 'Alawan as a rest stop on the route called \"al-Mada'in\". Between 1744 and 1757, a fort was built at al-Hijr on the orders of the Ottoman governor of Damascus, As'ad Pasha al-Azm. A cistern supplied by a large well within the fort was also built, and the site served as a one-day stop for Hajj pilgrims where they could purchase goods such as dates, lemons and oranges. It was part of a series of fortifications built to protect the pilgrimage route to Mecca.\nAccording to the researches of Al-Ansari, the Ottoman castle was found near the settlement dating to the year 1600 AD in 1984.\n\n19th century\nIn 1812, Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered Petra for the Western world. In the aftermath of the news making the rounds, Charles Montagu Doughty, an English traveller, heard of a similar site near Hegra (Madaʾin Salih), a fortified Ottoman town on the Hajj road from Damascus. To access the site, Doughty joined the Hajj caravan, and reached the site of the ruins in 1876, recording the visit in his journal which was published as Travels in Arabia Deserta. Doughty described the Ottoman fort, where he resided for two months, and noted that Bedouin tribesmen had a permanent encampment just outside of the building.\nIn the 19th century, there were accounts that the extant wells and oasis agriculture of al-Hijr were being periodically used by settlers from the nearby village of Tayma. This continued until the 20th century, when the Hejaz Railway that passed through the site was constructed (1901–08) on the orders of Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II to link Damascus and Jerusalem in the north-west with Medina and Mecca, hence facilitating the pilgrimage journey to the latter and to politically and economically consolidate the Ottoman administration of the centres of Islamic faith. A station was built north of al-Hijr for the maintenance of locomotives, and offices and dormitories for railroad staff. The railway provided greater accessibility to the site. However, this was destroyed in a local revolt during World War I. Despite this, several archaeological investigations continued to be conducted in the site beginning in the World War I period to the establishment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the 1930s up to the 1960s. The former railway station, restored and redeveloped, has been transformed into the Chedi Hegra Resort, opened in 2024. The project incorporates the historic station within the hotel complex, designed by the Milan-based architecture firm Giò Forma in collaboration with Black Engineering, and operated by General Hotel Management Ltd. (GHM) under its luxury brand The Chedi.\nBy the end of the 1960s, the Saudi Arabian government devised a program to introduce a sedentary lifestyle to the nomadic Bedouin tribes inhabiting the area. It was proposed that they settle down in al-Hijr, re-using the already existent wells and agricultural features of the site. However, the official identification of al-Hijr as an archaeological site in 1972 led to the resettlement of the Bedouins towards the north, beyond the site boundary. This also included the development of new agricultural land and freshly dug wells, thereby preserving the state of al-Hijr.\n\nRecent developments\nIn 1962, examples of many inscriptions were discovered and renewed the archaeological assessment of Hijr (Madaʾin Salih) by Winnett and Reed. Although the Al-Hijr site was proclaimed as an archaeological treasure in the early 1970s, few investigations had been conducted since. Mirdad had lived here for a short time and wrote notices about the region since 1977. Healey studied here in 1985 and wrote a book about the inscriptions of Hijr (Madaʾin Salih) in 1993.\nThe prohibition on the veneration of objects/artifacts has resulted in minimal archaeological activities. These conservative measures started to ease up beginning in 2000, when Saudi Arabia invited expeditions to carry out archaeological explorations as part of the government's push to promote cultural heritage protection and tourism. The archaeological site was proclaimed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008. More recent archaeological studies of the area have been made as part of efforts to document and preserve the heritage sites prior to opening the area to more tourism.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Nabataean site of Hegra was built around a residential zone and its oasis during the 1st century CE. The sandstone outcroppings were carved to build the necropolis. A total of four necropolis sites have survived, which featured 131 monumental rock-cut tombs spread out over 13.4 km (8.3 miles), many with inscribed Nabataean epigraphs on their façades:\n\nNon-monumental burial sites, totaling 2,000, are also part of the place. A closer observation of the façades indicates the social status of the buried person—the size and ornamentation of the structure reflect the wealth of the person. Some façades had plates on top of the entrances providing information about the grave owners, the religious system, and the masons who carved them. Many graves indicate military ranks, leading archaeologists to speculate that the site might once have been a Nabataean military base, meant to protect the settlement's trading activities.\nThe Nabataean kingdom was not just situated at the crossroad of trade but also of culture. This is reflected in the varying motifs of the façade decorations, borrowing stylistic elements from Assyria, Phoenicia, Egypt and Hellenistic Alexandria, combined with the native artistic style. Roman decorations and Latin scripts also figured on the troglodytic tombs when the territory was annexed by the Roman Empire. In contrast to the elaborate exteriors, the interiors of the rock-cut structures are severe and plain.\nA religious area, known as \"Jabal Ithlib,\" is located to the north-east of the site. It is believed to have been originally dedicated to the Nabataean deity Dushara. A narrow corridor, 40 metres (131 ft) long between the high rocks and reminiscent of the Siq in Petra, leads to the hall of the Diwan, a Muslim's council-chamber or law-court. Small religious sanctuaries bearing inscriptions were also cut into the rock in the vicinity.\nThe residential area is located in the middle of the plain, far from the outcrops. The primary material of construction for the houses and the enclosing wall was sun-dried mudbrick. Few vestiges of the residential area remain.\nWater is supplied by 130 wells, situated in the western and north-western part of the site, where the water table was at a depth of only 20 m (66 ft). The wells, with diameters ranging 4–7 m (13–23 ft), were cut into the rock, although some, dug in loose ground, had to be reinforced with sandstone.\n\nIn the Qur'an\nAccording to the Quran, the site of al-Hijr was settled by the tribe of Thamud, who \"(took) for (themselves) palaces from its plains and (carved) from the mountains, homes\".[Quran 7:73–79][Quran 11:61–69][Quran 15:80–84] The tribe fell to idol worship, and oppression became prevalent. The prophet Salih, to whom the site's name of Mada'in Salih is often attributed, called on the Thamudis to repent. The Thamudis disregarded the warning and instead commanded Salih to summon a pregnant she-camel from the back of a mountain. And so a pregnant she-camel was sent to the people from the back of the mountain, as proof of Salih's divine mission.\nHowever, only a minority heeded his words. The non-believers killed the sacred camel instead of caring for it as they were told, and its calf ran back to the mountain from whence it came. The Thamudis were given three days before their punishment was to take place, since they disbelieved and did not heed the warning. Salih and his monotheistic followers left the city, but the others were punished by God—their souls leaving their lifeless bodies in the midst of an earthquake and lightning blasts.\nRobert G. Hoyland suggested that their name was subsequently adopted by other new groups that inhabited the region of Mada'in Salih after the disappearance of the original people of Thamud. This suggestion is also supported by the narration of ʿAbdullah ibn ʿUmar and analysis of Ibn Kathir which report that people called the region of Thamud al-Hijr, while they called the province of Mada'in Salih as Arḍ Thamūd \"Land of Thamud\" and Bayt Thamud (house of Thamud). So the term \"Thamud\" was not applied to the groups that lived in Mada'in Salih, such as Lihyanites and Nabataeans, but rather to the region itself, and according to classical sources, it was agreed upon that the only remaining group of the native people of Thamud is the tribe of Banu Thaqif which inhabited the city of Taif south of Mecca.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of World Heritage Sites in Saudi Arabia\nIram of the Pillars\nLeuke Kome\nLihyan\nNabataeans\nList of colossal sculptures in situ\nAncient towns in Saudi Arabia\n\nFootnotes\nFurther reading\nAbdul Rahman Ansary; Ḥusayn Abu Al-Ḥassān (2001).

          "content": "al-Ula (Arabic: ٱلْعُلَا‎, romanized: al-ʿUlā), officially AlUla, is an ancient Arabian oasis city and governorate located in Medina Province, Saudi Arabia, 350 kilometres (220 miles) northwest of the city of Medina. Situated in the Hejaz, a region that features prominently in the history of Islam as well as several pre-Islamic Semitic civilizations, al-Ula was a market city on the historic incense trade route that linked India and the Persian Gulf to the Levant and Europe.\nFrom an archaeological perspective, the immediate vicinity contains a unique concentration of precious artifacts, including well-preserved ancient stone inscriptions that illustrate the development of the Arabic language, and a concentration of rock dwellings and tombs that date from the Nabatean and Dedanite periods that coincided with Greco-Roman influence during classical antiquity. Saudi Arabia's first UNESCO World Heritage Site, Hegra (also known as al-Hijr, or Mada'in Ṣalih), is located 22 km (14 miles) north of the city, in al-Ula governorate. Built more than 2,000 years ago by the Nabataeans, Hegra is often compared with its sister city of Petra, in Jordan. Meanwhile, the ancient walled oasis city of al-Ula, locally known as al-Dirah, situated near the oasis's palm grove that allowed for its settlement, contains a dense cluster of mudbrick and stone houses. al-Ula was also the capital of the ancient Lihyanites (Dedanites).\nThe Jabal Ikmah epigraphs and petroglyphs are located in the mountains around al-Ula. In 2023, they have been inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World International Register. Dating back to the second half of the first millennium BCE, they played a significant role in the evolution of Old Arabic languages and dialects. Carved in sandstone, these nearly 300 inscriptions are written in the pre-Nabataean Arabic languages Aramaic, Dadanitic, Thamudic, and Minaic.\nToday, the city of al-Ula is within the Governorate of al-Ula, one of seven constituent counties of Medina province. The city is located 110 km (68 miles) southwest of Tayma and 300 km (190 miles) north of Medina. The city (municipality) covers 2,391 square kilometres (923 sq mi), and has a population of 60,103 as of 2022. In addition to the ancient old town al-Dīrah, a more recent historical and adjacent settlement, al-Judaydah, displaying the settlement patterns of Arabic-Islamic urbanism, remains occupied and is currently experiencing a redesign. Since the 1980s, the oasis of al-Ula has experienced significant agricultural and urban growth. Since then, the settled Bedouins have been added to the population of Sedentary people and, as in the rest of the kingdom, a large population of immigrant workers.\nThe area is also known for its striking landscape of rocks, canyons, and wadis, and the contrast between these dry surroundings and the lush, palm-filled oases near the city's centre.\nThe oasis of al-Ula was once a key stop on the Hejaz railway, linking Damascus to Medina.\n\nHistory\nThe oasis of al-Ula has had permanent human settlement since 5000 BCE, through the Bronze Age.\nThe walled city of al-Ula was founded as an oasis in the desert valley, with fertile soil and plenty of water. It was located along Incense trade route, the network of routes that facilitated the trading of spices, silk and other luxury items through the Kingdom of Aksum, Arabia, Egypt, and India. The oasis of al-Ula stands on the site of the Biblical city of Dedan but was founded with the ancient North Arabian kingdom of Lihyan, which ruled from the 5th to 2nd century BCE.\nThe older history of the oasis has been divided into several phases. The Dedanite kingdom spans the 7th and 6th centuries BCE. Dedan is mentioned in the Harran Stela. In these it is told how Nabonidus, last ruler of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, made a military campaign to northern Arabia in 552 BCE or somewhat later, conquering Tayma, Dedan, and Yathrib (now Medina). It is thought that around the turn of the 5th century BCE, the kingdom became hereditary.\n\nThe next four hundred years, until around 100 BCE, was the period of Lihyanite kingdom. The Nabataeans were also the lords of the region at least until 106 CE, when the Roman Empire conquered and annexed it in their Arabia Petraea province.\n\nAl-Mabiyat, some 20 km (12 miles) away near Mughayrah became the next commercial centre of the region. It thrived from around 650 CE until it declined at some time before 1230. In the 13th century, the old city of al-Ula, locally known as al-Dīrah, was built, and many stones of the old Dedanite and Lihyanite ruins were reused. The oasis of al-Ula now became the major settlement of the region again until modern times. Between 1901 and 1908 the Ottomans built the Hejaz railway in order to link Damascus to Medina. The railway had main stations in both Madā'in Ṣaliḥ (Hegra) and al-Ula, where a line was built through the western part of al-Khuraybah, some 12 km (7.5 miles) to the north of the old medieval town, which is believed to be the site of the old Dedanite and Lihyanite town that is still standing there despite being in bad shape.\nIn the 20th century, the new town centre was established beside the old town, and eventually, the people left the old buildings. The last family is said to have gone in 1983, while the last service in the old mosque was held in 1985. Both the ruins of the medieval town al-Dīrah and the site of the Liyhanite settlement now lie within the limits of the modern town.\nThe most detailed study of the area was made by the French priests Antonin Jaussen and Raphaël Savignac, who visited the area three times, in 1907, 1908 and 1910. They studied the remains at Hegra and Dedan and collected a large number of Lihyanite, Minaean, Thamudic, and Nabataean inscriptions. Accordingly, it was their work that came to constitute the basis for all further study and research in the area's history.\nThe first European traveller of modern times to describe the town was Charles Doughty in 1876. Charles Huber was in al-Ula in 1881–1882. He returned in 1883 accompanied by Julius Euting. In 1968 a team of archaeologists from the University of London investigated 15 inscriptions.\nThe vertical sandstone cliffs surrounding the valley provide ample surfaces for rock art, making the governorate one of the richer petroglyph regions in the Kingdom. Ar-Ruzeiqiah is a mountain in the southern part of the governorate, with a large petroglyph panel displaying hundreds of images, including depictions of hunting scenes with humans and a variety of animals. Ibex are the most common species but camels, horses and other species can also be found. Mount Ikma also has a large façade with scenes, strange symbols, and inscriptions.\n\nTimeline\nThe following is the sequence of historical events and the ancient evidence found in the al-Ula governorate:\n\nAdministration\nThere are four major municipalities in the Governorate of al-Ula: al-Ula, the capital lying to the southwest (population 5,426); Mughayrāʾ (Arabic: مُغِيْرَاء) to the southeast (population 8,952); Abu Raku, to the north (population 2,678); and al-Ḥijr to the northeast (population 1,707).\n\nHeritage Village\nal-Ula Heritage Village, also known as Al-Dīrah, is the traditional Arabian village to which people of the oasis moved some eight centuries ago and inhabited until the 20th century. It was built on a higher part of the valley in order to be clear of the floods that can occur during the rainy season. At its maximum expansion the town contained more than 1000 houses, which were built adjacent to one another, thereby forming a wall around the town to defend the population. On the west of the town, at the bottom of the cliff, is the old souq, which has been renovated.\n\nRoyal Commission for al-Ula\nThe importance of al-Ula as an archaeological and historic site led to the establishment of The Royal Commission for al-Ula (RCU) in July 2017, the aim of which is to develop and promote al-Ula as an international tourism destination. Moreover, the commission develops the plans for heritage conservation and preservation. The Royal commission for al-Ula, along with al-Ula Development Company, have taken various development projects in the region, including the five districts planned for al-Ula by 2030. The five districts include: al-Ula old town, Dadan, Jabal Ikmah, Nabataeane Horizen, and Hegra Historical City. These five districts are part of a larger development plan for al-Ula that further aims to transform the city into a world-class tourist destination while also preserving its cultural and historical heritage.\n\nDevelopment plan\nTo promote tourism and gain more attraction, the Royal Commission for al-Ula is training 200 young Saudis on an ambitious project where tourists will explore the area's cultural treasures. Recruited from the al-Ula region, the 200 young people (all high-school age or in their first year as university students, and split equally between boys and girls) are in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia being trained in hospitality, learning new languages, studying farming and water technology, and researching the cultural, social and natural history of their home region.\nIn January 2023, the Public Investment Fund launched Al-Ula Development Company, a hospitality and real estate developer which aims to turn al-Ula into a global tourist destination.\n\nal-Ula International Airport\nThe Airport was a crucial part of the development strategy of the Royal Commission for al-Ula, which envisioned making it a global destination for culture and tourism. In March 2021, the airport was approved to receive international flights, along with an increased capacity of receiving 15 commercial flights at a time. The capacity was increased from 100,000 to 400,000 passengers per year.\n\nTourism\nThe Saudi Arabian government is collaborating with experts from around the world on the al-Ula development. In April 2018 it signed a 10-year deal with France that included provisions for hotels, transport infrastructure and a world-class culture and art museum. Since 2021, the Royal Commission of al-Ula has been running SME accelerator in collaboration with AstroLabs to ensure growth of the local tourism ecosystem. With this program, the region has set out on an ambitious mission to welcome 2 million tourists and contribute SAR 120Bn to the national GDP by 2030.\nA major integrated archaeological survey of al-Ula valley and beyond was launched by the commission, charged with protecting and regenerating the north-western region. While a conservation and development plan was established, some of the sites including the World Heritage Site of Madā'in Ṣaliḥ were closed to the public, but have been open since 2020 for visitors.\nWith the easing of visa process for international travelers, al-Ula attracts more tourists from abroad. Its most popular sites are: al-Ula Old town, Oasis Heritage Trail, Hegra UNESCO Heritage Site, Dadan, Jabal Ikmah, Jabal AlFil (Elephant Rock), Harrarat Viewpoint or Maraya Concert Hall. Travelers from around the world can also enjoy numerous of activities such as stargazing, desert dune bashing, desert campaign, hiking, biking, rock climbing, via ferrata and others.\n\nAccommodation in al-Ula\nAs the tourism infrastructure, aiming at tourism de luxe, is still being developed in al-Ula, finding affordable accommodation can be a challenge during high season. Tourists have a variety of options ranging from camping sites, holiday homes (apartments or chalets) to luxury resorts. As of 2023, al-Ula is home to 10 luxury resorts and accommodations available for visitors of the old city.\n\n\"Winter at Tantora\" festival\nWinter at Tantora was a traditional celebration to mark the start of the 40-day winter growing season. The name of the festival, 'Tantora', is inspired by a sundial located in the Old Town of al-Ula, which has been in use by the locals as a marker for the changing of the seasons. On 20 December 2018, the first \"Winter at Tantora\" started with a series of different themed weekend events including music, arts, entertainment, and cultural events. The concerts were performed in Maraya Concert Hall, which was newly design and constructed by Giò Forma Studio and Black Engineering for this purpose, and whose external walls are covered with mirrors, maraya being the Arabic word for 'mirrors'. A second edition of Winter at Tantora Festival was held on 19 December 2019, and included performances by Omar Khairat, EBI \"Ebrahim hamedi\", Andrea Bocelli, Yanni, Enrique Iglesias, and Lionel Richie.\nOn 26 December 2019, Maraya Concert Hall set a Guinness World Record for the largest mirrored building in the world, in which it was covered by 9,740 square metres (104,800 sq ft) of mirrored façade.\n\nAzimuth Festival\nAs part of the \"Winter at Tantora\" festival, Saudi Arabia hosted a three-day festival of music, art and food. Held between 5–7 March 2020, the Azimuth Festival was an event that brought the east and west together at al-Ula. It marked performances from artists like the Chainsmokers, Jean-Michel Jarre, Tinie Tempah and others. The event took place at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and so received only little publicity.\n\nPersian Night in Saudi Arabia's al-Ula\nFrom 6 to 7 March 2020, a large concert of Iranian singers was held at the winter celebration of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the city of al-Ula. Ebi, Leila Forouhar, Shahram Shabpareh, Shadmehr Aghili, Andy (Andranik Madadian), Arash and Sasy were present at the concert.\n\nal-Ula Vision\nOn 11 February 2019, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched the al-Ula vision which features a resort and nature reserve called Sharaan. The vision also includes the establishment of the Global Fund for the protection and revitalization of the Arabian leopard. al-Ula provides an opportunity for numerous international companies to benefit from the ambitious plans. Some notable companies are already working on and benefiting from the al-Ula project: AECOM, JAL International, Nesma & Partners, Alstom, KUN Investment Holding and others.\n\nClimate\nGallery\nSee also\nAl-Ula Development Company\nSarat Mountains\nHijaz Mountains\nHijaz Railway\nMawqaq\nTeam Jayco–AlUla, a cycling team partly sponsored by the city\nThe temple of Mahlab al-Naqa\nAl-Ula FC\nAl-Ahsa Oasis\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nAbdul Rahman Ansary, Ḥusayn Abu Al-Ḥassān, The civilization of two cities: Al-ʻUlā & Madāʼin Sāliḥ, 2001, ISBN 9960-9301-0-6, ISBN 978-9960-9301-0-7\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Al-'Ula at Wikimedia Commons\n\nRoyal Commission for AlUla website",
          "summary": "al-Ula (Arabic: ٱلْعُلَا‎, romanized: al-ʿUlā), officially AlUla, is an ancient Arabian oasis city and governorate located in Medina Province, Saudi Arabia, 350 kilometres (220 miles) northwest of the city of Medina. Situated in the Hejaz, a region that features prominently in the history of Islam as well as several pre-Islamic Semitic civilizations, al-Ula was a market city on the historic incense trade route that linked India and the Persian Gulf to the Levant and Europe.\nFrom an archaeological perspective, the immediate vicinity contains a unique concentration of precious artifacts, including well-preserved ancient stone inscriptions that illustrate the development of the Arabic language, and a concentration of rock dwellings and tombs that date from the Nabatean and Dedanite periods that coincided with Greco-Roman influence during classical antiquity. Saudi Arabia's first UNESCO World Heritage Site, Hegra (also known as al-Hijr, or Mada'in Ṣalih), is located 22 km (14 miles) north of the city, in al-Ula governorate. Built more than 2,000 years ago by the Nabataeans, Hegra is often compared with its sister city of Petra, in Jordan. Meanwhile, the ancient walled oasis city of al-Ula, locally known as al-Dirah, situated near the oasis's palm grove that allowed for its settlement, contains a dense cluster of mudbrick and stone houses. al-Ula was also the capital of the ancient Lihyanites (Dedanites).\nThe Jabal Ikmah epigraphs and petroglyphs are located in the mountains around al-Ula. In 2023, they have been inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World International Register. Dating back to the second half of the first millennium BCE, they played a significant role in the evolution of Old Arabic languages and dialects. Carved in sandstone, these nearly 300 inscriptions are written in the pre-Nabataean Arabic languages Aramaic, Dadanitic, Thamudic, and Minaic.\nToday, the city of al-Ula is within the Governorate of al-Ula, one of seven constituent counties of Medina province. The city is located 110 km (68 miles) southwest of Tayma and 300 km (190 miles) north of Medina. The city (municipality) covers 2,391 square kilometres (923 sq mi), and has a population of 60,103 as of 2022. In addition to the ancient old town al-Dīrah, a more recent historical and adjacent settlement, al-Judaydah, displaying the settlement patterns of Arabic-Islamic urbanism, remains occupied and is currently experiencing a redesign. Since the 1980s, the oasis of al-Ula has experienced significant agricultural and urban growth. Since then, the settled Bedouins have been added to the population of Sedentary people and, as in the rest of the kingdom, a large population of immigrant workers.\nThe area is also known for its striking landscape of rocks, canyons, and wadis, and the contrast between these dry surroundings and the lush, palm-filled oases near the city's centre.\nThe oasis of al-Ula was once a key stop on the Hejaz railway, linking Damascus to Medina.",

          "content": "Diriyah (Arabic: الدِرْعِيّة, romanized: ad-Dir‘īyah, lit. 'place of armor'; formerly romanized as Dereyeh and Dariyya) is a town and governorate in Saudi Arabia. Located on the northwestern outskirts of the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Diriyah was the original home of the House of Saud, and served as the capital of the Emirate of Diriyah under the first Saudi dynasty from 1727 to 1818. Today, the town is the seat of the Diriyah Governorate, which also includes the villages of Uyayna, Jubayla, and Al-Ammariyyah, among others—and is part of Riyadh Province.\nAt-Turaif District, the first capital of Saudis in Diriyah, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010. The layout of the city itself can be studied in the National Museum of Saudi Arabia with the help of a large-scale detailed model of the city on display there. Diriyah also hosted the Diriyah ePrix race for the Formula E championship from 2018–2024.\n\nLocation\nThe ruins of the old city of Diriyah lay on either side of the narrow valley known as Wadi Hanifa, which continues southwards through Riyadh and beyond. Consisting almost entirely of mud-brick structures, the ruins are divided into three districts, Ghussaibah, Al-Mulaybeed, and Turaif that are set on top of hills overlooking the valley. Of the three, Turaif is the highest, and its bottom is easily accessible to tourists by foot. Part of the city wall, running along the edges of the wadi and also made of mud bricks, are still extant along with some high observation towers.\nThe modern city is built at a lower altitude at the foot of the hill upon which Turaif is located. To the north of the town, inside the valley, are a number of gardens, palm groves, and small farms and estates. A dam known as Al-Ilb lies further north.\n\nHistory\nDuring Muhammad's era\nIn Muhammad's time the expedition of Muhammad ibn Maslamah took place here in Muharram, July 627 CE/6AH.\nA platoon of thirty Muslims under the leadership of Muhammad bin Maslamah was despatched on a military mission. It headed for the habitation of the Qurata, a sept of the Bakr clan of the Banu Kilab. The platoon attacked that sept and dispersed them in all directions. The Muslims captured war bounty and returned with the chief of the tribe of Banu Hanifa, called Thumamah Bin Uthal al-Hanafi.\n\nPost 1400\nAlthough the location is sometimes identified with an ancient settlement mentioned by Yaqut and Al-Hamadani known as \"Ghabra\", the history of Diriyah proper dates back to the 15th century. According to the chroniclers of Nejd, the city was founded in 1446–47 by Mani' Al-Muraydi (مانع المريدي), an ancestor of the Saudi royal family. Mani and his clan had come from the area of Al-Qatif in eastern Arabia, upon the invitation of Ibn Dir' (ابن درع), who was then the ruler of a group of settlements that now make up Riyadh. Ibn Dir' is said to have been a relative of Mani' Al-Mraydi, and Mani's clan is believed to have left the area of Wadi Hanifa at some unknown date and were merely returning to their country of origin.\nInitially, Mani' and his clan, known as the Mrudah, settled in Ghusaybah (الغصيبة) and Al-Mulaybeed (المليبيد). The entire settlement was named Al-Dir'iyah, after Mani's benefactor Ibn Dir'. Later on, the district of Turaif (طُريف) was settled. Many families from other towns or from the Bedouin tribes of the nearby desert eventually settled in the area and by the 18th century Diriyah had become a well-known town in Nejd.\nAt that time, Muhammad ibn Saud emerged from a struggle within the ruling family of Al-Diriyah, the Al Miqrin (مقرن, sons of Miqrin, a descendant of Mani'), and became the emir, or ruler, of Al-Diriyah. In 1744, Ibn Saud took in a religious scholar named Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, who hailed from the town of Al-Uyaynah, lying on the same wadi some 30 miles upstream. Ibn Saud agreed to implement al-Wahhabi religious views, and what later became known as the First Saudi State, with its capital at Diriyah, was born. Within the next several decades, Ibn Saud and his immediate descendants managed to subjugate all of Nejd, as well as the eastern and western regions of Arabia, and sent raids into Iraq. Diriyah quickly swelled in size and increased in wealth, becoming the largest town in Nejd and a major city in Arabia by the standards of the time. However, the Saudis' conquest of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina drew the ire of the Ottoman Empire, the major Islamic power at the time, which led to the Ottoman-Saudi War of 1811–1818 and an invasion of Arabia by the Ottoman Empire and Egyptian forces. They brought the Saudi state to an end in 1818, with Diriyah capitulating after a nearly-year-long siege. The leader of the invading force, Ibrahim Pasha, ordered the destruction of Diriyah. However, when a member of the local nobility tried to revive the Wahhabi state in Diriyah, Ibrahim ordered his troops to destroy the town even further and set whatever was left of it on fire. When the Saudis revived their fortunes in 1824 and again in 1902, they made their capital further south in Riyadh, which has remained their capital ever since.\nThe Ottoman Empire viewed the Arab challenge with caution, especially after the loss of Mecca and Medina, and the removal of the Ottoman emperor's name from Friday prayers. An Egyptian army under Ibrahim Pasha was sent to recover lost territory. In 1818 the army entered Diriyah and after a six-month siege penetrated the defences on the Turaif, totally destroyed the houses and cut down every tree in the palm groves. The Egyptians were estimated to have lost 10,000 men in the siege, and the Saudi forces 1,800.\nThe town's original inhabitants left Diriyah after 1818, with the bulk of them moving to Riyadh. In The Kingdom (first published in 1981), British author Robert Lacey observed that the Al Saud had \"left the shell of their old capital behind them, an enduring reminder of the frontiers of the possible\" and compared the old Diriyah to \"a sand-blown Pompeii\". However, the area was resettled in the late 20th century, mostly by former nomads (Bedouin), and a new city was founded by the Saudi government in the late 1970s. This new city of Diriyah grew in size and is now a small but modern town and the seat of its own governorate. The ruins remain a tourist attraction and are subject to a slow restoration project on the part of the Saudi government.\n\nRenovations and development plans\nSaudi Arabia has formed the Diriyah Gate Development Authority (DGDA) to oversee the preservation and development of the historic site. Despite Wahhabi destruction of many Islamic, cultural, and historical sites associated with the early history of Islam and the first generation of Muslims (Muhammad's family and his companions), the Saudi government undertook a large scale renovation of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's domain, turning it into a major tourist attraction. In 2018, Jerry Inzerillo, previously the CEO of Forbes Travel Guide, was hired to lead the new authority. In 2019, Inzerillo said that Diriyah would soon be known as \"the Beverly Hills of Riyadh.\"\nAmong the rebuilt structures are the bath and guest house, the Qasr Nasr, the Saad bin Saud Palace that was finished by the early 1990s, the Burj Faysal that was a wall tower renovated in the 1980s, major sections of the wall surrounding Turaif, and sections of the outer walls and some watchtowers surrounding the wadi. Outside of the Turaif district, on the opposite side of the wadi Hanifa, the region of the mosque of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab has been completely remodeled, leaving only some of the more recent original structures standing to the north of the complex build on the site of the historic mosque.\nThe \"Turaif District Development Plan\" aims to turn the district into a major national, cultural and touristic center. Before turning the complete site into a modern open-air museum documentation and necessary investigations, including excavations especially in places that may need to be remodelled, are planned in three major phases. These will include sites such as:\n\nAl-Imam Mohammad bin Saud Mosque and Salwa Palace.\nIbraheem Ibn Saud Palace and Fahad Ibn Saud Palace.\nFarhan Ibn Saud Palace, Torki Ibn Saud Palace, and Qoo'a Al-Sharia'a (eastern court of Salwa Palace).\nOnce finished, there will be a new visitors center as well as a documentation center. Four new museums are planned for the district. \n\nA museum of war and defense (as this was the site of a major siege in Saudi Arabia).\nA museum of horses.\nA museum of social life.\nA museum of commerce and finance.\nAdditionally, a Turaif traditional market will add to the open-air museum experience.\n\nThe Saudi government undertook a large scale renovation of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's domain, turning it into a major tourist attraction.\n\nMain historic sites\nThe old city's historic structures include:\n\nSalwa Palace (قصر سلوى) was the residence and first home of the Saʿūdī Amirs and Imāms during the First Saudi State. It is considered the largest palace on the site, rising four stories high. It is composed of five main parts built at different consecutive periods of time. It was probably finished by Saud ibn Abdul Aziz ibn Muhammad ibn Saud, who was Imam from 1803 to 1814. It is now a museum.\n\nSa'ad bin Saʿūd Palace popularly known as the Palace of Saad (قصر سعد بن سعود). One of the largest palaces on the site, it is famous for its courtyard, which was used as a stable. The palace was restored in the late 1980s and is several stories high. Sa'd ibn Sā'ud was the son of Imām Abd Allāh bin Saʿūd āl Sāʿūd (d. 1819) and played a prominent role in the battle for the city in 1818.\n\nThe Guest House and At-Turaif Bath House a traditional building consisting of a number of small courtyards surrounded by rooms. The Bath House is famous for its different architectural styles and shows how the building was waterproofed by using different plasters. Both the Guest and Bath Houses were supplied with water from a well in the wadi.\nImām Muḥammad bin Saʿūd Mosque, a mosque built first during the reign of Imām Mohammad bin Saud (1687–1765), perhaps replacing an earlier structure. Imām Abd al ʿAzīz bin Muḥammad Āl Saʿūd was assassinated here while leading Asr Salat in November 1803. The building fell into ruins after the invasion of 1818 and the disappearance of the first Saudi state; only part of the structure on eastern side survived to the 1970s and is still preserved. A small mosque was built on the south-west corner of the site some time in the first half of 20th century.

The first stage of the restoration is worth $13.3 million.\nIn October 2023 and in line with Saudi Vision 2030, The Saudi Public Investment Fund announced Al Balad Development Company, which aims to transform Historic Jeddah into a global tourist destination.\n\nHistory\nAl-Balad was founded in the 7th century and historically served as the centre of Jeddah. Al-Balad's defensive walls were torn down in the 1940s. In the 1970s and 1980s, when Jeddah began to become wealthier due to the oil boom, many Jeddawis moved north, away from Al-Balad, as it reminded them of less prosperous times. Al-Balad had insufficient parking space for large cars. Its stores did not sell expensive designer clothing. Poor immigrants moved in place of the Saudi population. The municipality of Jeddah began historical preservation efforts in the 1970s. In 1991 the Municipality of Jeddah founded the Jeddah Historical Preservation Society to preserve the historical architecture and culture of Al-Balad. In 2002, US$4 million were earmarked for the preservation society. In 2009, Al-Balad was nominated by Saudi Commission for Tourism and Antiquities to be added to UNESCO's World Heritage list, and it was accepted in 2014.\nMany Jeddawis had moved away from Al-Balad by 2007; the streets of Balad were still packed with people during the month of Ramadan. Around that year the Jeddah Urban Development Company was formed to restore Al-Balad.\n\nHistorical neighborhoods\nAl-Balad is mainly divided into number of different districts:\n\nAl-Mazloum neighborhood: This neighborhood was named after Abdulkarim al-Barzanji, who was killed by the Ottoman government and located in the north-eastern part of area  north of Al-Alawi Street, with Dar Al-Qabal, Al-Shafi'i Mosque and Souk Al-Jamaa.\nAl-Sham neighborhood: Located in the northern part of Al-Balad which includes this neighborhood Dar al-Sarti and Dar al-Zahid.\nAl-Yemen neighborhood: Located in the southern part of Al-Balad south of Al-Alawi Street and gained its name towards the country of Yemen, it includes Dar Al-Nassif, Dar Al-Jumjum, Dar Al-Shaarawi and Dar Al-Abdul-Samad.\nAl-Bahr neighborhood: Located in the south-western part of Jeddah, overlooking the sea and the Dar Al-Radwan House, known at the time as the Radwan of Sea.\n\nHistorical houses\nAmong the most famous and oldest buildings to date are the Al Nassif House and Al Jamjoom House in Yemen neighborhood, Al Baeshen House, Al Qabal Mosque, Al Shafi'i Mosque in Al Mazloum, Dar Al Banaja and Al Zahed Houses in the Al Sham neighborhood. Some of these buildings have risen to more than 30 meters. Their construction is still in good condition after decades.\n\nJeddah Old City is a home for 500-year-old buildings that are now subject to restoration as the Saudi crown prince Muhammad bin Salman pledged an amount of $13.3 million to restore 56 buildings. The restoration project will be implemented by the Ministry of Culture. The aim of the project is to boost the artistic culture in Saudi Arabia.\nIn May 2024, Jeddah Historic District Program announced the restoration of 3 historical houses, which are the Jokhdar House, Al-Rayyis House, and Kedwan House, and turning them into luxury hotels. The restoration was supervised by the ministry of culture, which assigned Al Balad Development Company to manage the hotels.\n\nNon-Muslim Cemetery\nThe Non-Muslim Cemetery (formerly known as the Christian Cemetery) is located on the King Fahd Branch Road in Al-Balad. The cemetery is hidden from sight by a wall and high trees. The supervision of the site is the responsibility of Western consulates in Jeddah.\nThe cemetery contains more than 400 graves, including a sarcophagus dedicated to the French explorer Charles Huber and a single Commonwealth War Graves Commission gravestone for a British soldier of the Second World War. Cyril Ousman, the British Vice-consul of Jeddah who was shot and killed by Prince Mishari bin Abdulaziz Al Saud is also buried here. Recent burials have been rare and infrequent, and are mostly of Indian and Filipino children.\nThe cemetery has existed since the 16th century when it was used to bury Portuguese casualties resulting from the Ottoman–Portuguese wars. The walls of the cemetery may have been built by Muhammad Ali of Egypt in the aftermath of the Ottoman–Saudi wars of the 1810s. The cemetery was vandalised following the Battle of Jeddah in 1925.\n\nGallery\nMisk Historic Jeddah Initiative\nIt is an annual event that takes place at Jeddah's historical area. The main aim of the event is to highlight the historical and cultural significance of AL-Balad. During the event, visitors walk through the old streets and alleys. Moreover, the initiative organizes a number of traditional entertainment activities for kids and adults. Being part of the Jeddah Season touristic festival 2019, Al-Balad hosted a number of events, all of which are organized under the title \"Kanz Al-Balad\". Kanz Al-Balad is a scavenger hunt in which participants are asked to find particular places or objects. Along the game, participants can enjoy attending more than 41 shows and plays in the area.\n\nSee also\nList of World Heritage Sites in Saudi Arabia\nJeddah Central\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBradley, John R.

          "content": "Nasseef House or Nassif House (Arabic: بيت نصيف Bayt Nasseef) is a historical structure in  Al-Balad, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. As of 2009, it is a museum and cultural center which has special exhibits and lectures given by historians.\n\nHistory\nThe construction of Nasseef House on old Jeddah's main street, Suq al-Alawi, began in 1872 and it was finished by 1881 for Omar Nasseef Effendi, member of a wealthy merchant family and, governor of Jeddah at the time.  When Abdulaziz Ibn Saud entered the city in December 1925, after the siege of Jeddah, he stayed in the Bayt Nasseef.  During his early stays in the city, he used it as a royal residence and received guests here. John R. Bradley, author of Saudi Arabia Exposed: Inside a Kingdom in Crisis, described the Nasseef House as \"kind of social salon\" in the 1920s, as consuls and merchants gathered there. The house belonged to the Nasseef family until 1975, when Muhammad Nasseef turned it into a private library that eventually accumulated 16,000 books, which could be read by anyone visiting him. Today these books belong to the central library of King Abdulaziz University.\n\nLayout and design\nNasseef house has 106 rooms, including artworks in some of the rooms. Besides works on wood, others on tiles can be seen as well as Arabic calligraphy. The design style is said to be Ottoman Turkish. This rather describes more the period during which it was built than relationship to designs popular in the Umayyad and Abbasids cultural centers at this time such as Baghdad, Cordoba and Damascus . The style is thought to be more related to stylistic elements found along the Red Sea, Egypt and maybe the Levant at that time.\nThe house has an irregular plan of rectangular rooms arranged around a central hall. The main entrance to the house is from the north, while there is a second entrance from the west, that was used by the women. After climbing a flight of stairs onto a small platform in front of the house, one enters into a large entry hall (dihliz) that opens to the central hall. To the left and right of the entrance hall, there are somewhat smaller rooms, that occupy the northern corners of the house. The west entrance opens straight into the central hall, while several smaller rooms are arranged around a small corridor, that connects to the central hall on the east. Similar a group of rooms occupies the southwest corner of the building. Directly opposite the main entrance hall is a large stairway system. Both the entrance hall in the north and the stairway in the south jut out from the facade as large risalits. Two large bay windows (rawashin), traditional in Jeddah, occupy the front facade above each other, connecting the two levels above the main door with their large wooden structure. There is a second smaller stairway in the southeast corner of the house that may have had more of a service function as further up the kitchen lies in this part of the house.\nThe layout of the main rooms such as the entry hall in the north with the two smaller corner rooms to its east and west, the central hall and the large stairway are all traced to the floors above. On the fourth floor, there is a large terrace on the outlines of the entry hall, while the rooms to the left and right are built as lofty structures with large windows that are covered with wood lattice from the outside. The terrace itself is screened from view by a wall with many windows. The other parts of this level have normal rooms. The fourth-floor rooms except in the southeastern part are covered by flat roofs in different levels, some usable as terraces. On the fifth floor, the kitchen resides above the main stairway in the middle of the southern part of the building. A light pavilion-like structure rises above the building on the middle eastern part, thus giving the Nasseef house seven floors (depending on how you count some of the intermediate or offset floors). This was used for resting and sleeping in, making the most of cooling breezes at this height.\nA motive of grouping elements in threes is found often in the house. This may be a group of three windows or a central doorway with a window or niche on each side. Most official rooms have a symmetrical design with niches on the walls that may correspond to windows or doors on opposite walls. Doors though are more often not arranged in the middle of a wall but rather near corners. The main stairway is fairly wide and the steps are very flat. This is said to have enabled camels to carry provisions to the kitchen on the fifth floor. Even if animals were used to carry heavy loads upstairs, one may consider it easier to direct a donkey around the turns of the stairway. There are two cisterns for water on the ground floor and latrines are provided for each level, while a domed shower can be found on the third floor. Pipes feed the waste water to underground septic tanks.\nPeople used to recognize Nasseef house as \"The House with the Tree\" because it was the only house in Balad that had one. Obviously, growing a tree was not an easy task because of the scarcity of water. The tree grows on a little square on the north of the house and is a neem tree (Azadirachta indica).  This may well be the oldest tree in Jeddah.\nA model of the Nasseef House may be viewed in the Jeddah Regional Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography.\n\nSee also\nList of museums in Saudi Arabia\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBradley, John R.

          "content": "Al-Ahsa Oasis (Arabic: الْأَحْسَاء, al-ʾAhsā), also known as al-Ḥasāʾ (الْحَسَا) or Hajar (هَجَر), is an oasis and historical region in eastern Saudi Arabia. Al-Ahsa Governorate, which makes up much of the country's Eastern Province, is named after it. The oasis is located about 60 km (37 miles) inland from the coast of the Arabian Gulf. Al-Ahsa Oasis comprises four main cities and 22 villages. The cities include Al-Mubarraz and Al-Hofuf, two of the largest cities in Saudi Arabia.\n\nDescription\nWith an area of around 85.4 km2 (33.0 sq mi), Al-Ahsa Oasis is the largest oasis in the world. A large part of the oasis is located in the Empty Quarter, also referred to as Rub' al Khali in Arabic. This covers almost three-quarters of the land in the oasis, while residential areas constitute 18%.\nThere are more than 2.5 million palm trees including date palms in the oasis, which is fed from a huge underground aquifer and irrigated by the flow of more than 280 artesian springs, allowing year-round agriculture in a region that is otherwise sand desert.\nThe oasis became a World Heritage site in 2018. It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network since December 2015. According to one author, the oases of Al-Ahsa and Al Ain (in the U.A.E., on the border with Oman) are the most important in the Persian Gulf region.\n\nEtymology\nAl-Ahsa is the plural form of \"Al-Ḥisā\" (Arabic: ٱلْحِسَى) which refers to a landscape of accumulated sand with an impermeable layer underneath. When rain falls onto such a landscape, the water soaks through the sand (which prevents it from evaporating) and is retained by the impermeable base layer, forming an aquifer. Wells drilled into the earth can then provide access to a cool spring.\nThe area used to be called Pit-Ardashir (Classical Syriac: ܦܝܛܐܪܕܫܝܪ) by Assyrians and Persians.\n\nHistory\nAncient history\nAl-Ahsa has been inhabited since prehistoric times because of its abundance of water in an otherwise arid region. Natural fresh-water springs have surfaced at oases in the region for millennia, encouraging human habitation and agricultural efforts (date palm cultivation especially) since prehistoric times.\nThe oasis region and specifically the name Hajar (also Hagar, Haǧar) may be related to the Ancient Near East toponym Agarum, mentioned in Dilmunite inscriptions as the original home of their chief deity Inzak. If so, Agarum probably referred to the mainland area of Arabia lying opposite Bahrain. According to the hypothesis, the Dilmun civilization originated at the oases of Eastern Arabia, but later relocated to the isle of Bahrain. This interpretation is not without criticism, however, and other sources place Agarum on the isle of Failaka.\n\nIslamic times\nEastern Arabia was conquered by the emerging Rashidun Caliphate during the 7th century. It was later inherited by the Umayyads and Abbasids. In 899 the region came under the control of the Qarmatian leader Abu Tahir al-Jannabi and was declared independent from the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad. Its capital was at al-Mu'miniya near modern Hofuf. By circa 1000, Al-Ahsa became the ninth largest city worldwide supporting 100,000 inhabitants. In 1077, the Qarmatian state of Al-Ahsa was overthrown by the Uyunids. Al-Ahsa subsequently fell under the rule of the Bahrani dynasty of the Usfurids, followed by their relatives, the Jabrids, who became one of the most formidable powers in the region, retaking the islands of Bahrain from the princes of Hormuz. The last Jabrid ruler of Bahrain was Muqrin ibn Zamil.\nIn 1521, the Portuguese Empire conquered the Awal Islands (the islands that comprise present-day Bahrain) from the Jabrid ruler Muqrin ibn Zamil. The Jabrids struggled to maintain their position on the mainland in the face of the Ottomans and their tribal allies, the Muntafiq. In 1550, Al-Ahsa and nearby Qatif came under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire with Sultan Suleiman I. Al-Ahsa was nominally the Eyalet of Lahsa in the Ottoman administrative system and was usually a vassal of the Sublime Porte. Qatif was later lost to the Portuguese. The Ottomans were expelled from Al-Ahsa in 1670, and the region came under the Banu Khalid Emirate.\nAl-Ahsa, along with Qatif, was incorporated into the Wahhabist Emirate of Diriyah in 1795 but returned to Ottoman control in 1818 with an invasion ordered by Muhammad Ali of Egypt. The Banu Khalid were again installed as rulers of the region but, in 1830 the Emirate of Nejd retook the region.\nDirect Ottoman rule was restored in 1871, and Al-Ahsa was placed first under Baghdad Vilayet and with Baghdad's subdivision Basra Vilayet in 1875. In 1913, ibn Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, annexed Al-Ahsa and Qatif into his domain of Najd.\n\nSaudi independence\nOn 2 December 1922, Percy Cox officially notified Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah that Kuwait's borders had been modified. Earlier that year, Major John More, the British representative in Kuwait, had met with Ibn Saud to settle the border issue between Kuwait and Najd. The result of the meeting was the Uqair Protocol of 1922, in which Britain recognized ibn Saud's sovereignty over territories claimed by the emir of Kuwait. Al-Ahsa was taken from the Ottomans in 1913, bringing the Al Sauds control of the Persian Gulf coast and what would become Saudi Arabia's vast oil reserves.\n\nEconomy and infrastructure\nAl-Ahsa is part of the region known historically for its high skill in tailoring, especially in making bisht, a traditional men's cloak. Al-Ahsa was one of the few areas in the Arabian Peninsula in which rice was grown. In 1938, petroleum deposits were discovered near Dammam, resulting in the rapid modernization of the region. By the early 1960s, oil production levels reached 1 million barrels (160,000 m3) per day. Today, Al-Ahsa is home to the largest conventional oil field in the world, the Ghawar Field.\nAl-Ahsa is known for its palm trees and date palms. Al-Ahsa has over 2.5 million palm trees which produce over 100,000 tons of dates every year.\nThe oasis is a popular tourist destination for Qatari nationals, who would make the 160-km cross-border drive to visit local attractions, as well as to find bargains for food, spices and clothing in Al-Ahsa's bazaars. Economic ties were severely disrupted by the Qatar diplomatic crisis, which led to the closure of Saudi Arabia's land border with Qatar. With the crisis' resolution and border reopening in 2021, however, Qatari tourists have gradually returned to Al-Ahsa; albeit in smaller numbers, due to improved Qatari self-sufficiency in goods.\nA road between Oman and Saudi Arabia, through the vast Empty Quarter sand desert, was completed in September 2021. Between 700 and 800 kilometres (430 and 500 miles) long, it extends from Al-Ahsa to the Omani town of Ibri. The Omani side of the road measures approximately 160 km (99 miles), and the Saudi side 580 km (360 miles).\n\nTourist sites\n12 locations were defined as the Cultural Landscape of Al-Ahsa Oasis (the World Heritage site):\n\nEastern Oasis (الواحة الشرقية)\nNorthern Oasis (الواحة الشمالية)\nAs-Seef (السِيف)\nSuq Al-Qaysariyah (سوق القيصرية)\nQasr Khuzam (قصر خزام)\nQasr Sahood (قصر صاهود)\nQasr Ibrahim (قصر إبراهيم)\nJawatha archaeological site (موقع جواثا الأثري)\nJawatha Mosque (مسجد جواثا)\nAl-'Oyun village (قرية العيون)\nAin Qannas archaeological site (موقع عين قناص الأثري)\nAl-Asfar lake (بحيرة الأصفر)\n\nClimate\nAl-Ahsa has a hot desert climate (Köppen Climate Classification: BWh), with long, extremely hot summers and short, very mild winters. The oasis has a very low annual precipitation of 83.3 mm (3.28 in), but receives a small amount of rain in winter and spring.\n\nSee also\nList of World Heritage Sites in Saudi Arabia\nEastern Arabia\nAl-Qarah\nAl-arba' Mountain\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nIn Arabic\nAl-Ahsa municipality website Archived 5 August 2010 at the Wayback Machine\nTor Eigeland, 1970, \"The Twice-Used Water\", Saudi Aramco World\nJon Mandaville, 1974, \"Al-Hasa: Outpost of Empire\", Saudi Aramco World",

          "content": "Al Masmak Palace (Arabic: قصر المصمك, romanized: Qaṣr al-Maṣmak), also called the Masmak Fortress or Masmak Fort, is a historic clay and mudbrick fort in the ad-Dirah neighborhood of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, located in close proximity to the al-Hukm Palace in the Qasr al-Hukm District. Commissioned in 1865 by Abdullah bin Faisal Al Saud, it was completed in 1895 following the takeover of the town by the Rashidi dynasty. The fortress was the main theatre for the Battle of Riyadh in 1902, which marked the prelude to the unification of Saudi Arabia. It was opened to the general public in 1995 after its conversion into a museum.\n\nHistory\nThe construction of the fort was started by Abdullah bin Faisal, Emir of Najd, in 1865. It was completed in 1895 by Emir of Riyadh, 'Abdurrahman ibn Sulaiman under the reign of Muhammad bin Abdullah Al Rashid, the ruler of the Emirate of Jabal Shammar and head of the House of Rasheed, who had wrested control of the city from the local House of Saud, who later went into exile. It was built with four watchtowers and thick walls, with a foundation of stone blocks, lying in the center of Riyadh, in the old city, part of the modern Deira district. It is one of the only historic buildings that has survived in the kingdom. The building was situated in the commercial center of historic Riyadh.\nIn January 1902, Emir 'Abdulaziz ibn Saud Al Saud, who was at the time living in exile in Kuwait, returned to Riyadh and led an ambush against the Masmak fortress, regaining it from the House of Rasheed in the Battle of Riyadh. The event, which restored Saudi control over Riyadh, is considered one of the most important in the completion of the Unification of Saudi Arabia. It was used as a munitions warehouse from 1902 to 1938 by King Abdulaziz before he moved his court to then newly built Murabba Palace.\nIn 1979, the Municipality of Riyadh prepared a study for the restoration of the Masmak, following which a renovation of the fortress began. Their vision was realized in 1995 when the Ministry of Education and the Supreme Commission for the Development of Riyadh converted the building into a museum, making it an integral part of Saudi heritage. It was later incorporated into the King Abdulaziz Historical Centre, a series of restored buildings in Riyadh. Centennial celebrations were held in 1999. The museum includes displays several antique guns, costumes and agricultural artifacts.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Masmak can be divided into six distinct parts: the gate, the mosque, the majlis, the well, the towers and the courtyard.\n\nGate\nThe main gate of the palace is located in the western wall, measuring 3.6 m (12 ft) high and 2.65 m (8 ft 8 in) wide. It is 10 cm (3.9 in) thick and is made of palmwood. There is an opening on the center of the door, called al-Khokha, which is just big enough for one person to pass at a time, and is a defensive feature designed to allow people in and out without opening the door.\nMosque\nThe mosque is located to the left of the entrance. It is a large room supported by several columns with shelves in the walls for placing mus'hafs of the Quran. A mihrab can be found in the mosque, and there are holes in the walls to provide ventilation.\nMajlis\n\nIt is located directly ahead of the entrance and is a room in the shape of a rectangle. On the wall facing the entrance and the southern wall, there are holes in the walls for ventilation and lighting, similar to those found in the mosque. \nWell\nThe well is located in the northeastern corner of the fortress.\nWatchtowers\nIn each of the corners of the mosque are conical towers, each approximately 18 m (59 ft) high. The towers are accessed through staircases located inside them. The walls of the towers are especially thick, with a thickness of 1.25 m (4 ft 1 in).\nCourtyard\nThe courtyard is surrounded by rooms with columns connected to each other internally, and it has stairs on the eastern side leading to the first floor and roofs, and there are three residential units, the first served as the residence of the ruler, the second used as a bayt al-mal, and the third was allocated for the accommodation of guests.\n\nSee also\nList of museums in Saudi Arabia\nMajlis\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nPlan and Photographs\nVirtual tour of the fort",

          "content": "Murabba Palace (Arabic: قصر المربّع  Qaṣr al Murabbaʿ; literally the 'Square Palace') is a historic palace in the al-Murabba neighborhood of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, located in the King Abdulaziz Historical Center. One of the first buildings erected outside the walls of the old city, it served as the official workplace and main residence of King Abdulaziz ibn Saud from 1938 until his death in 1953. It is named after its square with the form of 400 by 400 metres (1,300 by 1,300 ft). The palace was transformed into a museum and opened to the general public in 1999.\n\nHistory\nThe palace was built by King Abdulaziz outside the walled town of Riyadh, being the first major expansion of the city in the twentieth century. Construction was started in 1936 and partly finalized in 1938. It was fully completed in 1945. The construction was supervised by builder Ibn Qabba, but the King also personally involved in the construction process. The palace was intended to be a family residence and court for the king. With the construction of the palace three novel technologies were introduced to the Saudi society: the use of the automobiles as means of transportation, electricity by means of generators and water closets with drainage systems. In order to connect the palace with the city center a concrete road was constructed which was also new in the city. In 1939 electricity, lighting, fans, limited air-conditioning, a central water supply and lavatories were added by the Aramco technicians to the palace.\nThe king left his former court in Masmak fort when the construction was finished, and used the palace as his residence and court from 1938 until his death in 1953. One of his wives, Hussa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi, also moved with him to the palace in 1938. Another palace, Addeera, was also used as a royal residence.\nDuring the reign of King Abdulaziz Murabba Palace witnessed many official visits and sign of various agreements. A lift was installed into the Murabba Palace in the late 1940s when the king had difficulty in climbing the stairs due to advanced arthritis. It was the first lift in Saudi Arabia. The king appointed one of his sons, Prince Mansour, as emir of the palace.\nKing Abdulaziz's successor, King Saud, also used the palace for official activities. For instance, he inaugurated the council of ministers with a ceremony in the Murabba Palace on 7 March 1954.\n\nLocation\nThe Murabba palace is situated two kilometers north of the old city of Riyadh, and its total area was over 16 hectares. The area of the palace was later expanded to 30 hectares. In a study dated 2021 the size of the palace is cited as 9,844.64 m2.\nThe palace is located about half a mile from Masmak fort. The area of the palace was called Murabba Al Sufyan. In the south of the palace there are gardens, and the Batha valley is situated in the east. Wadi Abu Rafie is in the west, and small hills lie on the north of the palace.\nMurabba Palace is very close to Al Shamsia mansion which was the residence of Saud Al Kabeer and his wife Noura bint Abdul Rahman, elder sister of King Abdulaziz. In the 1950s the Murabba Palace was connected to Al Nasriyah Farm which is in fact a rural palace in the west of old Riyadh through a stone road.\n\nLayout and style\nThe building is a complex of palaces used for different purposes, housing two stories with 32 rooms. Overall shape of the building is cubic. It is made up of residential buildings, service facilities and the diwan of the king. These buildings are surrounded by a courtyard. A huge brick wall also surrounds the palace, and there are nine gates. The main gate was originally on the west side, but, later the gate on the southern side was used as main entrance which allowed a short link to the nearby mosque.\nThe upper floor of the building used for court of the king included audience hall, offices of administrative affairs, communications and guest chambers. The ground floor housed the offices for palace utilities, security and administration.\nThe building has a plain style and reflects the general features of the traditional Najdi architecture. It also reflects the general characteristics of Najd's urban pattern, namely solid masses, covered streets, and the integration of courtyards. The palace was built mainly by bricks, indigenous stones, tamarisk trunk and palm-leaf stalks. The walls of the building were made by straw reinforced adobe, and have engraved ornaments on coating. Local acacia with palm frond matts was used for the ceiling of the palace. The wood beams supporting the ceiling have decorations with yellow, red, and black geometric patterns.\n\nCurrent usage\nA development project was initiated by the Saudi Commission for Tourism & Antiquities in 1999 to renovate the Murabba palace. It was converted into a museum and became open to public visits. It was called \"living museum\" after renovation. It is part of the King Abdulaziz Darat or King Abdulaziz Historical Center.\nIn the current usage, the ground floor includes the guards' room and stores for food, coffee, wood and other materials needed for cooking. The upper floor is made up of salons and waiting rooms for visitors. There several historic garments and crafts are exhibited.

It would have been one of the world's most powerful artillery pieces, with a 53-caliber, 210 mm (8.3 in) gun firing 109-kilogram shells over a range of 57 km (35 mi). The Al-Fao system was to weigh 44 tonnes, and its 550 hp engine was to give it a top speed of 90 km/h (56 mph) on roads, and 60–70 km/h (37–43 mph) cross-country. The Al-Fao's autoloader was to provide it with a rate of fire of four rounds a minute.\nA self-propelled howitzer using the same 155 mm gun as the South African G6, similar to the Al-Fao and named Majnoon, was also designed by Gerald Bull on an Iraqi order.\n\nHistory\nThe design of the Majnoon and Al-Fao started around 1988. That year, South Africa had tried to sell the G6 howitzer to Iraq, but the Iraqis found it too expensive, and requested that Bull design two equivalents for them. Prototypes of each model had to be ready by May 1989, in time for the Baghdad International Arms Fair. Numerous French, German and Spanish companies were contracted to manufacture parts for the guns, while the design for the chassis was bought in Czechoslovakia and modified to South African specifications. The deadline was met, and the prototypes of both Majnoon and Al-Fao were presented at the Arms Fair, although these were far from complete. However, by early 1990, the Iraqis had imported all the know-how, equipment and machinery necessary to produce them, as well as ammunition. Subsequent events prevented the realisation of the Majnoon and Al-Fao projects.\n\nSee also\nList of artillery\n\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliography\nAltobchi, Ali; Cooper, Tom; Fontanellaz, Adrien (2022).

          "content": "Marid Castle (or Marid balance) is a historic military fortress located in the city of Dumat al-Jandal in the Al-Jawf region of Saudi Arabia, about 50 km from Sakaka. Built in the first century AD, it was first mentioned in the third century in the context of Queen Zenobia's campaign against Dumat al-Jandal and Tayma's rebellion, when her troops weren't able to capture the fortress.\n\nEtymology\nThe castle of Marid was named for its rebellion and insurrection against those trying to storm it, as stated by Yaqout al-Hamwi.\n\nLocation\nThe castle is located on a hill rising to about 620 meters above sea level, and overlooks the city of Dumat al-Jandal, which is affiliated to the Al-Jawf region from the western side. That contributed to its importance, as the castle can oversee all parts of the town and observe any approaching friend or foe long before they arrive.\n\nHistory\nMarid fortress dates back to the first century. The oldest mention of it dates back to the third century AD when Queen Zenobia invaded Adumato (today's Dumat al-Jandal) and Tayma, but could not capture the fortress. Therefore she reportedly said, \"Marid has rebelled, and Ablaq has glorified.\"\nIn 633 CE, Khalid ibn al-Walid annexed Dumat al-Jandal to the newly formed Islamic empire.\nIn 1853, Ha'il governor Talal Ibn Rashid damaged the castle with two cannons.\nIn 1909, Nawwaf Ibn Sha'lan besieged it for ten months until he could wrest it from the Rashids.\nSome parts of the castle were rebuilt between AH 1416 and AH 1423 (AD 1995/6-2002/3). In addition to a mosque restoration project that includes parts of the Al-Daraa neighborhood, which included installing stone buildings, restoring cracks in the facades, entrance, and corridors, and installing wooden ceilings of taramax stems in the corridors and layers of moisture insulation.\nIn 2018, the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage (SCTH) has launched a project to repair the castle. In the framework of the project, a cafe and a traditional restaurant have been built in the castle.\n\nDescription\nThe castle was originally rectangular, but is now oval in shape. It can be accessed from two main entrances, one in the south of the castle and the other in the north, next to the tower.\nThe castle has two floors; the first was built in stone, the upper one in mud. There also are four conical towers with height of 12 meter, and they were created at various times. Inside the castle, there are two wells, and its floors contain rooms for guards, shooting and observation.\nThe castle is surrounded by a large stone wall with many openings for observation. The fence has two entrances, one from the south and the other from the north.\nVisitors need about 30 minutes to climb up to the top of the castle due to its 1000 steps twisted stair.\n\nExcavation and dating of the castle and city\nExcavations at Marid Castle - inside and outside the castle - have proven that the castle dates back to the Nabataean period; the excavations brought to light layers with pottery and other findings dating back to the Nabataean period, such as:\n\nThe castle foundations\nNabatean findings in different parts of the Dumat al-Jandal\nA group of Nabataean mass cemeteries in the site of Sanaymiyat, located west of Dumat al-Jandal.\nWall remains of the castle.\nIn 1976, excavations revealed Nabataean and Roman ceramics dating back to the first and second centuries AD. An excavation team completed the excavation east of the castle and the wall.\nExcavations made by Khaleel Ibrahim Al-Moaqil in 1986 added to observations made in 1976 that a homogeneous layer of Roman-Nabataean pottery sherds indicated a prosperous community during the time of the Nabataeans, to whose realm the region probably belonged.\n\nNearby ancient sites\nThere are many other ancient sites in the castle's vicinity, such as the Omar ibn al-Khattab mosque, Old Dumat al-Jandal's market, the historical neighborhood of Al-Dara’a, and the city wall.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of castles in Saudi Arabia\nLake Dumat al-Jandal\nTourism in Saudi Arabia\n\nReferences\nGeneral\nAl-Jawf, the fortified North Castle, Abdul Rahman Al-Tayeb Al-Ansari, Dar Al-Qawafel for Publishing and Distribution, Riyadh, 1429 AH / 2008AD.\nAl-Jouf and Hussain Al-Khalifa  Nawaf Al-Rashed, Pavilion of Al-Jouf Emirate, the 18th National Festival of Heritage and Culture, 1423 AH / 2003 AD.\nResearch in the effects of Al-Jouf region, Khalil Ibrahim Al-Moaqil, Abdul Rahman Charitable Foundation, Al-Jouf, 1st floor, 1422 AH.",

          "content": "The Farasan Islands (Arabic: جزر فرسان; transliterated: Juzur Farasān) are a small group of coral islands approximately 40 km off the coast of Jizan in the Red Sea, belonging to Saudi Arabia.\nThe government provides free ferry rides twice a day to Farasan Islands from Jizan Port. The largest island of the archipelago is Farasan Island; others include Sajid Island and Zufaf Island. The islands are a popular tourist destination. In recent years the Saudi government has tried to increase the tourism quality and worth (as part of a larger tourism drive in the country) of the Islands in order to attract even more visitors.\n\nHistory\nIn the 1st century AD, the islands were known as Portus Ferresanus. A Latin inscription dating from 144 AD  has been found on the island which attests to the construction of a Roman garrison. \nIt is believed that the islands may have been attached to the Roman province of Arabia Felix, before being transferred to Aegyptus some time before 144 AD. \nThis fact would make the Farasan Islands the farthest Roman outpost (until at least the third century), being nearly 4,000 km (2,500 mi) from Rome itself. \nIt remained this way up until the Arab Muslim conquest of the islands and subsequent Islamization. Furthermore it is noteworthy to pinpoint that recent studies found that in the local language there are some loanwords from Latin.\n\nAl-Najdi Mosque\nAl-Najdi Mosque was constructed in 1929. It is one of the oldest worship sites on Farasan Island in the Jazan region, southwest of Saudi Arabia. The mosque originally took 13 years to build, and features paintings and inscriptions brought from India. The mosque is currently undergoing phase two restoration as part of the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Project for the Development of Historic Mosques.\n\nClimate\nThe climate in the Farasan archipelago is characterised by a long hot season (April–October) and a short mild one (November–March). In the long dry period, high temperatures are usually dominant. The mean annual temperature is 30 °C. Furthermore, the mean relative humidity in winter ranges from 70% to 80% and in summer between 65% and 78%. The highest rainfall occurs in April and the precipitation is generally unpredictable in the southern part of Red Sea.\n\nNature\nThe Farasan Island Marine Sanctuary is a protected area. It is home to the Arabian gazelle, and, in winter, migratory birds from Europe. Oceanic animals include manta rays, whale sharks, and several species of sea turtles including endangered and critically endangered green and hawksbill turtles, dugongs, and several species of dolphins and whales with occasional visits by others such as orcas.\n\nEconomy\nAfter a French engineer investigated petroleum seeps on the islands in 1912, a 75-year concession was granted to the Red Sea oilfields. At the time, the Farasan Islands supported a small fishing industry.\nTourism and fishing also play a role in the economy. Farasan Island is connected to Jezan port by ferry.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nSaudi Aramco World: Dreaming of Farasan\nFarasan Island, a diver's paradise Archived 2016-03-02 at the Wayback Machine, Splendid Arabia: A travel site with photos and routes",
