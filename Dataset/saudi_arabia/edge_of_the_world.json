      "content": "Edge of the World is the only studio album by Tipton, Entwistle & Powell, released on 7 March 2006 by Rhino and WEA. The album was recorded in the mid-1990s, and consists of outtakes from Glenn Tipton's debut solo album Baptizm of Fire. Tipton was accompanied by The Who bassist John Entwistle and drummer Cozy Powell on these recordings. Both Entwistle and Powell died in the years between the album's recording and release, Powell in 1998 and Entwistle in 2002.\n\nBackground\nConsisting of tracks that were not released on Baptizm of Fire, Tipton released the album on March 7, 2006 in memory of Entwistle and Powell. \"I'm sure everyone will know,\" Tipton stated, \"this album is a tribute to their unique styles and skills and a small part of the immense legacy they have left behind which will continue to inspire people all over the world for many years to come.\"\nGlenn presented the tracks to Rhino/Warners Entertainment and they agreed that this album had to be released. This album was released March 7, 2006 and all proceeds from sales go to the Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\nReception\nGreg Prato of AllMusic called the album, \"more melodic than the average Judas Priest release, and one that focuses mostly on Tipton's riffs and Powell's thunderous drumming rather than Entwistle's bass dexterity. Additionally, Tipton's vocals certainly won't be mistaken for Rob Halford's anytime soon, but they're certainly not cringe-worthy, either.\"\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nTipton, Entwistle & Powell\nGlenn Tipton – guitars, vocals\nJohn Entwistle – bass\nCozy Powell – drums\nAdditional musicians\nDon Airey – keyboards\nNeil Murray – additional bass on track 11\nProduction\nProduced and mixed by Glenn Tipton and Sean Lynch\nArtwork by Mark Wilkinson\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nwww.glenntipton.com\nwww.judaspriest.com",
