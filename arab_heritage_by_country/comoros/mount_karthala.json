      "content": "Mount Karthala or Karthola (Arabic: القرطالة Al Qirṭālah) is an active volcano and the highest point of the Comoros at 2,361 m (7,746 ft) above sea level. It is the southernmost and larger of the two shield volcanoes forming Grande Comore island, the largest island in the nation of Comoros. The Karthala volcano is very active, having erupted more than 20 times since the 19th century. Frequent eruptions have shaped the volcano's 3 km by 4 km summit caldera, but the island has largely escaped broad destruction. Eruptions on April 17, 2005 and May 29, 2006 ended a period of quiet.\n\nVolcanic activity\nApril 2005 eruption\nThe eruption, which carried a risk of lava flows and deadly volcanic gas, caused the evacuation of 2,000 residents, which led to the death of an infant. The crater was clearly changed by the eruption. A grey field of ash surrounds the crater and the caldera itself seems larger and deeper. The crater lake, which formed after Karthala's last eruption in 1991 and once dominated the caldera, is now gone completely. In its place were rough, dark grey rocks, possibly cooling lava or rubble from the collapsed crater.\n\nMay 2006 activity\nOn May 29, Reuters reported that residents of Moroni could see lava spewing at the top of the volcano. Within a few days the volcanic activity subsided.\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe mountain is covered by intact moist evergreen forest from 1200 metres to about 1800 metres above sea-level. Higher up the vegetation consists of stunted trees and heathland where the giant heather Erica comorensis grows. The mountain's forest is threatened by logging and the spread of agriculture. Many of the species found on the mountain are unique to the Comoros and four bird species are found only on the slopes of Mount Karthala: Grand Comoro drongo, Humblot's flycatcher, Karthala scops owl, and Karthala white-eye.\n\nImportant Bird Area\nA 14,228 ha (35,160-acre) tract encompassing the upper slopes and summit of the mountain has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International, because it supports populations of Comoros blue pigeons, Comoros fodies, Comoros olive pigeons, Comoros thrushes, Grand Comoro brush warblers, Grand Comoro bulbuls, Grand Comoro drongos, Humblot's flycatchers, Humblot's sunbirds, Karthala scops owls, Karthala white-eyes, and Malagasy harriers.\n\nKarthala National Park\nKarthala National Park protects an area of 262.14 km2 on the mountain. It was designated in 2010.\n\nSee also\nList of Ultras of Africa\n\nNotes\nReferences\n\"Karthala\". Global Volcanism Program. Smithsonian Institution.\n\"Comoros forests\". Terrestrial Ecoregions.

      "content": "## Overview\nMount Karthala is a volcano on the island of Grand Comore in the Comoros.\n\n## Get in\nThe day starts early at 06:00 at -11.71666743.2666671 Mvouni  where you meet the guide. There you start hiking up-a-hill for next 6-7 hours walking 13 km and climbing 1950 meters ascent. Scenery change is dramatic, you start at tropical, green and humid jungles, while you walk trees get thinner, smaller and less dense. Some parts are burned down to plant more profitable flora. At the highest point of the hike, you're surrounded just by bushes around. Thereafter you climb down to a crater, walk on grey sand. As you get closer to the crater, cracks in a rock releases stream, it gets pretty warm. The crater itself is huge and culminates the hike.\nFrom there it's another 2 hours down to the basecamp which you reach at 14:00-15:00. It's a small settlement about 800 meters above sea level constituted of 5-8 tinplated sheds. Your guide might prepare dinner for both of you.\nNext day awaits another 2-3 hours hike down to the starting point. You might be back to -11.70361143.2536112 Moroni city centre by 11:00.\nOne day hike would start at 06:00 and finish 17:00-19:00 depending on speed.\n\n## Fees and permits\nThe entry to the region is free. There is nobody guarding the entrance and charging for it.\nGuides available for €60 for one day. It is possible to do as a one long day hike for €60 or overnight for €100 at a small settlement around 800 meters above sea level. There's no such thing as tourist agencies around the city advertising the hike, so to find a guide you need to go to Mvouni village next to Moroni and ask around. It's a small village so you should have no problems getting a number of a guide.\n\n## Eat\nNo restaurants on the way however in a small settlement there is a place to make fire and pots\n\n## Sleep\nThere is a small settlement about 800 meters above sea level constituted of 5-8 tinplated sheds. Your guide would arrange the stay. One might sleep in a shed and camp outside.\n\n## Stay safe\nThe volcano is considered very active. It erupted 20 times since the 19th century, last time being 2005.",
