      "content": "Amman is the capital and the largest city of Jordan, and the country's economic, political, and cultural center. With a population of five million as of 2024, Amman is Jordan's primate city and is the largest city in the Levant region, the fifth-largest city in the Arab world, and the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East.\nAmman is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman dates to the 8th millennium BC in 'Ain Ghazal, home to the world's oldest statues of the human form. During the Iron Age, the city was known as Rabat Aman, the capital of the Ammonite Kingdom. In the 3rd century BC, the city was renamed Philadelphia and became one of the ten Greco-Roman cities of the Decapolis. Later, in the 7th century AD, the Rashidun Caliphate renamed the city Amman. Throughout most of the Islamic era, the city alternated between periods of devastation and periods of relative prosperity. Amman was largely abandoned during the Ottoman period from the 15th century until 1878, when it was resettled by Circassians. The city grew after it was connected to the Hejaz Railway in 1904, leading to the formation of its first municipal council in 1909.\nAmman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan's capital in 1921, receiving migrations from different Jordanian and Levantine cities, and later several successive waves of refugees: Palestinians in 1948 and 1967; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003; and Syrians since 2011. It was initially built on seven hills, but now spans over 19 hills combining 22 areas, which are administered by the Greater Amman Municipality. Areas of Amman have gained their names from either the hills (jabal) or the valleys (wadi) they occupy, such as Jabal al-Luweibdeh and Wadi Abdoun. East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities, while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city.\nApproximately one million visitors arrived in Amman in 2018, which made it the 89th most-visited city in the world and the 12th most-visited Arab city. Amman has a relatively fast growing economy and it is ranked as a Beta− global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Moreover, it was named one of the Middle East and North Africa's best cities according to economic, labor, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. The city is among the most popular locations in the Arab world for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices, alongside Doha and only behind Dubai. Amman has a bus network, including a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system that serves the city and connects it to neighboring Zarqa.\n\nEtymology\nAmman derives its name from the ancient people of the Ammonites, whose capital the city had been since the 13th century BC. The Ammonites named it Rabat ʿAmmān (𐤓𐤁𐤕 𐤏𐤌𐤍), with the term Rabat meaning the \"Capital\" or the \"King's Quarters\". In the Hebrew Bible, the town is referred to as Rabbaṯ Bənē ʿAmmōn (רַבַּת בְּנֵי עַמּוֹן) or simply Rabbā (רַבָּה), and it appears in English translations as \"Rabbah of the Ammonites,\" \"Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, or \"Rabbath Ammon.\" Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the Macedonian ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom who reigned from 283 to 246 BC, renamed the city Philadelphia (Ancient Greek: Φιλαδέλφεια; literally: \"brotherly love\"), after himself, after occupying it. By the Islamic era, the Rashidun Caliphate restored its ancient Semitic name and called it Amman in the 7th century AD.\n\nHistory\nNeolithic period\nThe Neolithic site of ʿAin Ghazal today lies in the outskirts of Amman. At its height, around 7000 BC (9000 years ago), it had an area of 15 hectares (37 acres) and was inhabited by ca. 3000 people (four to five times the population of contemporary Jericho). At that time, the site was a typical aceramic Neolithic village. Its houses were rectangular mud-bricked buildings that included a main square living room, whose walls were made up of lime plaster. The site was discovered in 1974 as construction workers were working on a road crossing the area. By 1982, when the excavations started, around 600 meters (2,000 feet) of road ran through the site. Despite the damage brought by urban expansion, the remains of ʿAin Ghazal provided a wealth of information.\nʿAin Ghazal is well known for a set of small human statues found in 1983, when local archeologists stumbled upon the edge of a large pit containing them. These statues are human figures made with white plaster, with painted eyes. Thirty-two figures were found in two caches, fifteen of them full figures, fifteen busts, and two fragmentary heads. Three of the busts depicted two-headed characters, the significance of which is not clear.\n\nIron Age: the Ammonites\nIn the 13th century BC, Amman was the capital of the Ammonite Kingdom, and became known as \"Rabat Amman\". Rabat Amman provided several natural resources to the region, including sandstone and limestone, along with a productive agricultural sector that made it a vital location along the King's Highway, the ancient trade route connecting Egypt with Mesopotamia, Syria and Anatolia. As with the Edomites and Moabites, trade along this route gave the Ammonites considerable revenue. Milcom is named in the Hebrew Bible as the national god of Rabat Amman. Another ancient deity, Moloch, usually associated with the use of children as offerings, is also mentioned in the Bible as a god of the Ammonites, but this is probably a mistake for Milcom. However, excavations by archeologists near Amman Civil Airport uncovered a temple, which included an altar containing many human bone fragments. The bones showed evidence of burning, which led to the assumption that the altar functioned as a pyre and used for human sacrifice.\nAmman is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible. According to the biblical narrative, the Ammonite king Hanun allied with Hadadezer, king of Aram-Zobah, against the United Kingdom of Israel. During the war, Joab, the captain of King David's army, laid siege to Rabbah, Hanun's royal capital, and destroyed it (2 Samuel 12:26–28, 1 Chronicles 20:1–2). David took a great quantity of plunder from the city, including the king's crown, and brought it to his capital, Jerusalem (2 Samuel 12:29–31). Hanun's brother, Shobi, was made king in his place, and became a loyal vassal of David (2 Samuel 17:27). Hundreds of years later, the prophet Jeremiah foresaw the coming destruction and final desolation of the city (Jeremiah 49:2).\nSeveral Ammonite ruins across Amman exist, such as Rujm Al-Malfouf and some parts of the Amman Citadel. The ruins of Rujm Al-Malfouf consist of a stone watchtower used to ensure the protection of their capital and several store rooms to the east. The city was later conquered by the Assyrians, followed by the Babylonians and the Achaemenid Persians.\n\nClassical and late antiquity\nHellenistic period\nConquest of the Near East by Alexander the Great firmly consolidated the influence of Hellenistic culture, marking the start of the Hellenistic period. Little is known about Greek/Macedonian control over the Levantine coast and Transjordan until 301 BCE, 22 years after Alexander's death, when the Ptolemies took control over this area. The Greeks founded new cities in the area of modern-day Jordan, including Gadara (Umm Qays), Gerasa (Jerash), Pella (Tabaqat Fahl) and Philadelphia (Amman). Ptolemy II nicknamed Philadelphus, the Macedonian ruler of Egypt, established in or before 259/58 BCE at the site of Amman what was initially probably a military colony, which then developed into a full-blown Greek-type polis, possibly by settling there Hellenised Tyrean colonists. Ptolemy II named it Philadelphia (Ancient Greek: Φιλαδέλφεια, romanized: Philadelpheia), evoking \"brotherly love\" in Greek, in adulation to his own nickname.\nWritten sources speak of members of the Jewish Tobiad family based in Jerusalem, who worked for the Ptolemies as tax collectors in charge of the entire region. The last known Tobiad, Hyrcanus, built the unique Hellenistic palace of Tyros (today's Qasr al-Abd, 'Castle of the Slave') southwest of Philadelpheia, before killing himself in c. 170-168 BC as the Seleucid king Antiochus IV seemed poised to attack him. This was one of several episodes in the Syrian Wars between the Seleucids and the Ptolemies, ending with the 200 BCE victory of the Seleucids at the Battle of Panium. In 218/17 BCE for instance, Seleucid king Antiochus III destroyed the Ptolemaic garrisons in the centre of Transjordan, capturing Philadelpheia in the process. Even after 200 BCE, Philadelpheia seems to have broken free at times from Seleucid rule and probably also escaped capture by Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaios (r. c. 103 – c. 76 BCE), who was more successful elsewhere in the region. Other Hasmonean and Nabataean rulers acted as regional power brokers, contributing to the instability of the political situation during the 2nd century BCE and until the advent of the Roman period in the following century, which led to the Hellenisation of the region only truly setting in under the Romans.\n\nRoman period\nThe Romans conquered much of the Levant in 63 BC, inaugurating a period of imperial rule conducted from Rome that lasted for four centuries. In the northern parts of modern-day Jordan, the Greek cities of Philadelphia (Amman), Gerasa, Gedara, Pella and Arbila joined with other cities in Palestine and southern parts of today's Syria to form the Decapolis League, a confederation based on common economic and cultural interests (see also Scythopolis, Hippos, Capitolias, Canatha and Damascus). Philadelphia became a point along a road stretching from Ailah to Damascus that was built by Emperor Trajan in AD 106. This provided an economic boost for the city in a short period of time.\nThere are traces of Roman construction all across Jordan. In Amman the most conspicuous structures include the Great Temple (inaccurately known as the \"Temple of Hercules\") at the Amman Citadel, the Roman Theatre, the Odeon, and the Nymphaeum. The two theaters and the nymphaeum fountain were built during the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius around AD 161. The theatre was the larger venue of the two and had a capacity for 6,000 attendees. It was oriented north and built into the hillside, to protect the audience from the sun. To the northeast of the theatre was a small odeon. Built at roughly the same time as the theatre, the Odeon had 500 seats and is still in use today for music concerts. Archaeologists speculate that the structure was originally covered with a wooden roof to shield the audience from the weather. The Nymphaeum is situated southwest of the Odeon and served as Philadelphia's chief fountain. The Nymphaeum is believed to have contained a 600 square meters (6,500 sq ft) pool which was 3 meters (9.8 ft) deep and was continuously refilled with water.\n\nByzantine period\nDuring the late Byzantine period in the seventh century, several bishops were based in the city; a number of church sites from the Byzantine period have been discovered there - see List of Byzantine churches in Amman.\n\nEarly Muslim period (7th–11th century)\nIn the 630s, the Rashidun Caliphate conquered the region from the Byzantines, beginning the Islamic era in the Levant. Philadelphia was renamed \"Amman\" by the Muslims and became part of the district of Jund Dimashq. A large part of the population already spoke Arabic, which facilitated integration into the caliphate, as well as several conversions to Islam. Under the Umayyad caliphs who began their rule in 661 AD, numerous desert castles were established as a means to govern the desert area of modern-day Jordan, several of which are still well-preserved. Amman had already been functioning as an administrative centre. The Umayyads built a large palace on the Amman Citadel hill, known today as the Umayyad Palace. Amman was later destroyed by several earthquakes and natural disasters, including a particularly severe earthquake in 749. The Umayyads were overthrown by the Abbasids three years later.\nAmman's importance declined by the mid-8th century after damage caused by several earthquakes rendered it uninhabitable. Excavations among the collapsed layer of the Umayyad Palace have revealed remains of kilns from the time of the Abbasids (750–969) and the Fatimids (969–1099). In the late 9th century, Amman was noted as the \"capital\" of the Balqa by geographer al-Yaqubi. Likewise, in 985, the Jerusalemite historian al-Muqaddasi described Amman as the capital of Balqa, that it was a town in the desert fringe of Syria surrounded by villages and cornfields and a regional source of lambs, grain and honey. Its inhabitants he reports, at the time, were Shia Muslims. Furthermore, al-Muqaddasi describes Amman as a \"harbor of the desert\" where Arab Bedouin would take refuge, and that its citadel, which overlooked the town, contained a small mosque.\n\nCrusaders and Ayyubids (12th–13th century)\nThe occupation of the Citadel Hill by the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem is so far based only on interpretations of Crusader sources. William of Tyre writes in his Historia that in 1161 Philip of Milly received the castle of Ahamant, which is seen to refer to Amman, as part of the lordship of Oultrejordain. In 1166 Philip joined the military order of the Knights Templar, passing on to them a significant part of his fief including the castle of Ahamant or \"Haman\", as it is named in the deed of confirmation issued by King Amalric. By 1170, Amman was in Ayyubid hands. The remains of a watch tower on Citadel Hill, first attributed to the Crusaders, now are preferentially dated to the Ayyubid period, leaving it to further research to find the location of the Crusader castle. During the Ayyubid period, the Damascene geographer al-Dimashqi wrote that Amman was part of the province of al-Karak, although \"only ruins\" remained of the town.\n\nMamluk period (13th–early 16th century)\nDuring the Mamluk era (late 13th–early 16th century), the region of Amman was a part of Wilayat Balqa, the southernmost district of Mamlakat Dimashq (Damascus Province). The capital of the district in the first half of the 14th century was the minor administrative post of Hisban, which had a considerably smaller garrison than the other administrative centers in Transjordan, namely Ajlun and al-Karak.  In 1321, the geographer Abu'l Fida, recorded that Amman was \"a very ancient town\" with fertile soil and surrounded by agricultural fields. For unclear, though likely financial reasons, in 1356, the capital of Balqa was transferred from Hisban to Amman, which was considered a madina (city). In 1357, Emir Sirghitmish bought Amman in its entirety, most likely to use revenues from the city to help fund the Madrasa of Sirghitmish, which he built in Cairo that same year. After his purchase of the city, Sirghitmish transferred the courts, administrative bureaucracy, markets and most of the inhabitants of Hisban to Amman. Moreover, he financed new building works in the city.\nOwnership of Amman following Sirghitmish's death in 1358 passed to successive generations of his descendants until 1395, when his descendants sold it to Emir Baydamur al-Khwarazmi, the na'ib as-saltana (viceroy) of Damascus. Afterward, part of Amman's cultivable lands were sold to Emir Sudun al-Shaykhuni (died 1396), the na'ib as-saltana of Egypt. The increasingly frequent division and sale of the city and lands of Amman to different owners signalled declining revenues coming from Amman, while at the same time, Hisban was restored as the major city of the Balqa in the 15th century. From then until 1878, Amman was an abandoned site periodically used to shelter seasonal farmers who cultivated arable lands in its vicinity and by Bedouin tribes who used its pastures and water. The Ottoman Empire annexed the region of Amman in 1516, but for much of the Ottoman period, al-Salt functioned as the virtual political center of Transjordan.\n\nModern era (1878–present)\nLate Ottoman period (1878–1917)\nAmman began to be resettled in 1878, when several hundred Muslim Circassians arrived following their expulsion from the North Caucasus by the Russian Empire during the events of the Russo-Circassian War. Between 1878 and 1910, tens of thousands of Circassians became refugees in the Ottoman Empire, which had moved large numbers of them into its province of Syria. The Ottoman authorities directed the Circassians, who were mainly of peasant stock, to settle in Amman, and distributed arable land among them. Their settlement was a partial manifestation of the Ottoman statesman Kamil Pasha's project, which did not materialize, to establish the Amman Province (vilayet) which, along with other sites in its vicinity, would become Circassian-populated townships guaranteeing the security of the Damascus–Medina highway. The first Circassian settlers, who belonged to the Shapsug tribe, lived near Amman's Roman theater and incorporated its stones into the houses they built. The English traveller Laurence Oliphant noted in his 1879 visit that most of the original Circassian settlers had left Amman by then, with about 150 remaining. They were joined by Circassians from the Kabardian and Abzakh tribes in 1880–1892.\n\nUntil 1900 settlement was concentrated in the valley and slopes of the Amman stream and settlers built mud-brick houses with wooden roofs. The French Dominican priest Marie-Joseph Lagrange commented in 1890 about Amman: \"A mosque, the ancient bridges, all that jumbled with the houses of the Circassians gives Amman a remarkable physiognomy\". The new village became a nahiye (subdistrict) center of the kaza of al-Salt in the Karak Sanjak established in 1894. By 1908 Amman contained 800 houses divided between three main quarters, Shapsug, Kabartai and Abzakh, each called after the Circassian groupings which respectively settled there, a number of mosques, open-air markets, shops, bakeries, mills, a textile factory, a post and telegraph office and a government compound (saraya). Kurdish settlers formed their own quarter called \"al-Akrad\" after them, while a number of townspeople from nearby al-Salt and al-Fuheis, seeking to avoid high taxes and conscription or attracted by financial incentives, and traders from Najd and Morocco, had also moved to the town.\n\nThe city's demographics changed dramatically after the Ottoman government's decision to construct the Hejaz Railway, which linked Damascus and Medina, and facilitated the annual Hajj pilgrimage and trade. Operational in central Transjordan since 1903, the Hejaz Railway helped to transform Amman from a small village into a major commercial hub in the region. Circassian entrepreneurship, facilitated by the railway, helped to attract investment from merchants from Damascus, Nablus, and Jerusalem, many of whom moved to Amman in the 1900s and 1910s. Some of the Arab families who arrived from surrounding regions during this period include Hudhud, Malas, Idlibi, Bdeir, Haddad, and Kawar. Although they settled after the local Circassian population and Bedouins of Jordan, they earned the nickname 'Founding Families of Amman' for establishing key institutions such as pharmacies and construction firms, and for bringing goods and expertise from their more developed cities of origion. Amman's first municipal council was established in 1909, and Circassian Ismael Babouk was elected as its mayor.\n\nFirst World War\nThe First and Second Battle of Amman were part of the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I and the Arab Revolt, taking place in 1918. Amman had a strategic location along the Hejaz Railway; its capture by British forces and the Hashemite Arab army facilitated the British advance towards Damascus. The second battle was won by the British, resulting in the establishment of the British Mandate.\n\nBritish Mandate; Emirate of Transjordan (1921–1946)\nIn 1921, the Hashemite emir and later king Abdullah I designated Amman instead of al-Salt to be the capital of the newly created state, the Emirate of Transjordan, which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1950. Its function as the capital of the country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the Jordan River at the time. The early settlers who came from Palestine were overwhelmingly from Nablus, from which many of al-Salt's inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus. Amman later attracted people from the southern part of the country, particularly al-Karak and Madaba. The city's population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.\nThe British report from 1933 shows around 1,700 Circassians living in Amman. Yet the community was far from insulated. Local urban and nomadic communities formed alliances with the Circassians, some of which are still present today. This cemented the status of Circassians in the re-established city.\n\nPost-independence (1946–present)\nJordan gained its independence in 1946 and Amman was designated the country's capital. Amman received many refugees during wartime events in nearby countries, beginning with the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. A second wave arrived after the Six-Day War in 1967. In 1970, Amman was a battlefield during the conflict between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Jordanian Army known as Black September. The Jordanian Army defeated the PLO in 1971, and the latter were expelled to Lebanon. The first wave of Iraqi refugees settled in the city after the 1991 Gulf War, with a second wave occurring in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nOn 9 November 2005, Al-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's leadership launched coordinated explosions in three hotel lobbies in Amman, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. Jordan's security as a whole was dramatically improved after the attack, and no major terrorist attacks have been reported since then. Most recently a wave of Syrian refugees have arrived in the city during the ongoing Syrian Civil War which began in 2011. Amman was a principal destination for refugees for the security and prosperity it offered.\nDuring the 2010s, the city has experienced an economic, cultural and urban boom. The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation, and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace. This strained Jordan's scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers of quick expansion without careful municipal planning.\n\nGeography\nAmman is situated on the East Bank Plateau, an upland characterized by three major wadis which run through it. Originally, the city had been built on seven hills. Amman's terrain is typified by its mountains. The most important areas in the city are named after the hills or mountains they lie on. The area's elevation ranges from 700 to 1,100 m (2,300 to 3,600 ft). Al-Salt and al-Zarqa are located to the northwest and northeast, respectively, Madaba is located to the west, and al-Karak and Ma'an are to Amman's southwest and southeast, respectively. One of the only remaining springs in Amman now supplies the Zarqa River with water. Trees found in Amman include Aleppo pine, Mediterranean cypress and Phoenician juniper.\n\nClimate\nAmman features a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa) in its western and northern neighborhoods, while its eastern and southern neighborhoods experience a semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh/BSk).\nThe summer season in Amman is moderately long, characterized by mild heat and refreshing breezes. However, occasional heatwaves may occur during this period. Spring is brief yet warm, with temperatures reaching highs of 28 °C (82 °F). This season typically commences between April and May, lasting for about a month. Winter usually sets in around the end of November, extending through early to mid-March. During winter, temperatures typically hover around or below 17 °C (63 °F), with sporadic snowfall occurring once or twice a year.\nThe average annual rainfall in Amman is around 385 mm (15 in), with great variations between different parts of the city. The western areas receive more than 500 mm (20 in) of rainfall, whereas the eastern areas receive less than 250 mm (10 in). Rainfall primarily occurs between November and April, and periodic droughts are not uncommon.\nAmman experiences heavy fog on about 120 days each year. The city's diverse weather conditions are heavily influenced by differences in elevation. While snow might accumulate in the higher-altitude western and northern regions of Amman (with an average altitude of 1,000 m or 3,300 ft above sea level), the city center (at an elevation of 700 m or 2,300 ft) might experience rainfall simultaneously. This variation in elevation leads to extreme microclimates within Amman, with each district having its own distinct weather patterns.\n\nLocal government\nAmman is governed by a 41-member city council elected directly for terms of four years. All Jordanian citizens above 18 years old are eligible to vote in the municipal elections. However, the mayor is appointed by the king and not through elections. In 1909 a city council was established in Amman by Circassian Ismael Babouk who became the first-ever mayor of the capital, and in 1914 Amman's first city district center was founded.\nThe Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) has been investing in making the city a better place, through a number of initiatives. Green Amman 2020 was initiated in 2014, aiming to turn the city to a green metropolis by 2020. According to official statistics, only 2.5% of Amman is green space. In 2015 GAM and Zain Jordan started operating free-of-charge Wi-Fi services at 15 locations, including Wakalat Street, Rainbow Street, The Hashemite Plaza, Ashrafieh Cultural Complex, Zaha Cultural Center, Al Hussein Cultural Center, Al Hussein Public Parks and others.\n\nAdministrative divisions\nJordan is divided into twelve administrative divisions, each called a governorate. Amman Governorate divides into nine districts, five of which are divided into sub-districts. The Greater Amman Municipality has 22 areas which are further divided into neighborhoods.\nThe city is administered as the Greater Amman Municipality and covers 22 areas which include:\n\nEconomy\nBanking sector\nThe banking sector is one of the principal foundations of Jordan's economy. Despite the unrest and economic difficulties in the Arab world resulting from the Arab Spring uprisings, Jordan's banking sector maintained its growth in 2014. The sector consists of 25 banks, 15 of which are listed on the Amman Stock Exchange. Amman is the base city for the international Arab Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East, serving clients in more than 600 branches in 30 countries on five continents. Arab Bank represents 28% of the Amman Stock Exchange and is the highest-ranked institution by market capitalization on the exchange.\n\nTourism\nAmman is the fourth most-visited Arab city and the ninth highest recipient of international visitor spending. Roughly 1.8 million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3 billion in the city. The expansion of Queen Alia International Airport is an example of the Greater Amman Municipality's heavy investment in the city's infrastructure. The recent construction of a public transportation system and a national railway, and the expansion of roads, are intended to ease the traffic generated by the millions of annual visitors to the city.\nAmman, and Jordan in general, is the Middle East's hub for medical tourism. Jordan receives the most medical tourists in the region and the fifth highest in the world. Amman receives 250,000 foreign patients a year and over $1 billion annually.\n\nBusiness\nAmman is introducing itself as a business hub. The city's skyline is being continuously transformed through the emergence of new projects. A significant portion of business flowed into Amman following the 2003 Iraq War. Jordan's main airport, Queen Alia International Airport, is located south of Amman and is the hub for the country's national carrier Royal Jordanian, a major airline in the region. The airline is headquartered in Zahran district. Rubicon Group Holding and Maktoob, two major regional information technology companies, are based in Amman, along with major international corporations such as Hikma Pharmaceuticals, one of the Middle East's largest pharmaceutical companies, and Aramex, the Middle East's largest logistics and transportation company.\nIn a report by Dunia Frontier Consultants, Amman, along with Doha, Qatar and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, are the favored hubs for multinational corporations operating in the Middle East and North Africa region. In FDI magazine, Amman was chosen as the Middle Eastern city with the most potential to be a leader in foreign direct investment in the region. Furthermore, several of the world's largest investment banks have offices in Amman including Standard Chartered, Société Générale, and Citibank.\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Amman reached 4,007,526 in 2015; the city contains about 42% of Jordan's entire population. It has a land area of 1,680 km2 (648.7 sq mi) which yields a population density of about 2,380 inhabitants per square kilometer (6,200/sq mi). The population of Amman has risen exponentially with the successive waves of immigrants and refugees arriving throughout the 20th century. From a population of roughly 1,000 in 1890, Amman grew to around 1,000,000 inhabitants in 1990, primarily as a result of immigration, but also due to the high birthrate in the city. Amman had been abandoned for centuries until hundreds of Circassians settled it in the 19th century. Today, about 40,000 Circassians live in Amman and its vicinity. After Amman became a major hub along the Hejaz Railway in 1914, many Muslim and Christian merchant families from al-Salt immigrated to the city. A large proportion of Amman's inhabitants have Palestinian roots (urban or rural origin), and the two main demographic groups in the city today are Arabs of Palestinian or Jordanian descent. Other ethnic groups comprise about 2% of the population. There are no official statistics about the proportion of people of Palestinian or Jordanian descent.\nNew arrivals consisting of Jordanians from the north and south of the country and immigrants from Palestine had increased the city's population from 30,000 in 1930 to 60,000 in 1947. About 10,000 Palestinians, mostly from Safed, Haifa and Acre, migrated to the city for economic opportunities before the 1948 war. Many of the immigrants from al-Salt from that time were originally from Nablus. The 1948 war caused an exodus of urban Muslim and Christian Palestinian refugees, mostly from Jaffa, Ramla and Lydda, to Amman, whose population swelled to 110,000. With Jordan's capture of the West Bank during the war, many Palestinians from that area steadily migrated to Amman between 1950 and 1966, before another mass wave of Palestinian refugees from the West Bank moved to the city during the 1967 War. By 1970, the population had swelled to an estimated 550,000. A further 200,000 Palestinians arrived after their expulsion from Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War. Several large Palestinian refugee camps exist around the center of Amman.\nBecause Amman lacks a deep-rooted native population, the city does not have a distinct Arabic dialect, although recently such a dialect utilizing the various Jordanian and Palestinian dialects, has been forming. The children of immigrants in the city are also increasingly referring to themselves as \"Ammani\", unlike much of the first-generation inhabitants who identify more with their respective places of origin.\n\nReligion\nAmman has a mostly Sunni Muslim population, and the city contains numerous mosques. Among the main mosques is the large King Abdullah I Mosque, built between 1982 and 1989. It is capped by a blue mosaic dome beneath which 3,000 Muslims may offer prayer. The Abu Darweesh Mosque, noted for its checkered black-and-white pattern, has an architectural style that is unique to Jordan. The mosque is situated on Jabal Ashrafieh, the highest point in the city. The mosque's interior is marked by light-colored walls and Persian carpets. During the 2004 Amman Message conference, edicts from various clergy-members afforded the following schools of thought as garnering collective recognition: Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi'i, Ja'fari, Zahiri, Zaydi, Ibadi, tassawuf-related Sufism, Muwahhidism and Salafism. Amman also has a small Druze community.\nLarge numbers of Christians from throughout Jordan, particularly from al-Salt, have moved to Amman. Nearby Fuheis is a predominantly Christian town located to the northwest of the city. A small Armenian Catholic community of around 70 families is present in the city. Ecclesiastical courts for matters of personal status are also located in Amman. A total of 16 historic churches are located in Umm ar-Rasas ruins in Al-Jeezah district; the site is believed to have initially served as Roman fortified military camps which gradually became a town around the 5th century AD. It has not been completely excavated. It was influenced by several civilizations including the Romans, Byzantines and Muslims. The site contains some well-preserved mosaic floors, particularly the mosaic floor of the Church of Saint Stephen.\n\nCityscape\nDowntown Amman, the city center area (known in Arabic as Al-Balad), has been dwarfed by the sprawling urban area that surrounds it. Despite the changes, much remains of its old character. Jabal Amman is a tourist attraction in old Amman, where the city's largest souks, museums, ancient constructions, monuments, and cultural sites are found. Jabal Amman also contains the famous Rainbow Street and the cultural Souk Jara market.\n\nArchitecture\nResidential buildings are limited to four stories above street level and if possible another four stories below, according to the Greater Amman Municipality regulations. The buildings are covered with thick white or beige limestone or sandstone. The buildings usually have balconies on each floor, with the exception of the ground floor, which has a front and back yard. Some buildings make use of Mangalore tiles on the roofs or on the roof of covered porches. Hotels, towers and commercial buildings are either covered by stone, plastic or glass.\n\nHigh-rise construction and towers\nZahran district in west Amman is the location of the Jordan Gate, which is a high class commercial and residential project currently under construction in the Wadi Al-Seer district of Amman, Jordan, it consists of two high-rise buildings connected by a multi-storey podium.\nNew Abdali district hosts a mall, a boulevard along with several hotels, commercial and residential towers. Valued at more than US$5 billion with two main phases, the district created a new visible center for Amman and act as the major business district for the city.\nThe first phase, estimated at more than JD2.4 billion, and receiving about 20 million visitors annually, contains seven Itowers extending over an area of 1.03 million square metres. It attracts about 500 companies operating in 27 sectors, and provided a total of 15,000 job opportunities by 2023.\nA second phase was announced in May 2024, which will cover an area of 1.2 million square meters and is anticipated to create over 3,000 job opportunities each year, were outlined in the statement. This phase involves the construction of a multi-use conference center with a capacity for 25,000 people, as well as two towers that will include hotels, residential apartments, commercial centers, and advanced medical facilities.\n\nCulture\nMuseums\nThe largest museum in Jordan is The Jordan Museum. It contains much of the valuable archeological findings in the country, including some of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Neolithic limestone statues of 'Ain Ghazal, and a copy of the Mesha Stele. Other museums include the Duke's Diwan, Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts, Jordan Archaeological Museum, The Children's Museum Jordan, The Martyrs' Memorial and Museum, the Royal Automobile Museum, the Prophet Mohammad Museum, the Museum of Parliamentary Life, the Jordan Folklore Museum, and museums at the University of Jordan.\n\nLifestyle\nAmman is considered one of the most liberal cities in the Arab world. The city has become one of the most popular destinations for expatriates and college students who seek to live, study, or work in the Middle East or the Arab world in general. The city's culinary scene has changed from its shawarma stands and falafel joints to embrace many popular international restaurants and fast-food outlets such as Asian fusion restaurants, French bistros and Italian trattorias. The city has become famous for its fine dining scene among Western expatriates and Persian Gulf tourists.\n\nLarge shopping malls were built during the 2000s in Amman, including the Mecca Mall, Abdoun Mall, City Mall, Al-Baraka Mall, TAJ Lifestyle Center, Zara Shopping Center, Avenue Mall, and Abdali Mall in Al Abdali. Wakalat Street (\"Agencies Street\") is Amman's first pedestrian-only street and carries a lot of name-label clothes. The Sweifieh area is considered to be the main shopping district of Amman.\nNightclubs, music bars and shisha lounges are present across Amman, changing the city's old image as the conservative capital of the kingdom. This burgeoning new nightlife scene is shaped by Jordan's young population. In addition to the wide range of drinking and dancing venues on the social circuit of the city's affluent crowd, Amman hosts cultural entertainment events, including the annual Amman Summer Festival. Souk Jara is a Jordanian weekly flea market event that occurs every Friday throughout the summer. Sweifieh is considered to be the unofficial red-light district of Amman as it holds most of the city's nightclubs, bars. Jabal Amman and Jabal al-Luweibdeh are home to many pubs and bars as well, making the area popular among bar hoppers.\nAlcohol is widely available in restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and supermarkets. There are numerous nightclubs and bars across the city, especially in West Amman. As of 2011, there were 77 registered nightclubs in Jordan (excluding bars and pubs), overwhelmingly located in the capital city. In 2009, there were 222 registered liquor stores in Amman.\n\nCuisine\nDanielle Pergament of The New York Times described Ammani cuisine as a product of several cuisines in the region, writing that it combines \"the bright vegetables from Lebanon, crunchy falafels from Syria, juicy kebabs from Egypt and, most recently, spicy meat dishes from Jordan's neighbor, Iraq. It's known as the food of the Levant – an ancient word for the area bounded by the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian peninsula. But the food here isn't just the sum of its calories. In this politically, religiously and ethnically fraught corner of the world, it is a symbol of bloodlines and identity.\" However, the city's street food scene makes the Ammani cuisine distinctive.\n\nSports\nAmman-based football clubs Al-Wehdat and Al-Faisaly, both former league champions, share one of the most popular rivalries in the local football scene. Amman hosted the 2016 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup along with Irbid and Zarqa.\nThe 2007 Asian Athletics Championships and more than one edition of the IAAF World Cross Country Championships were held in the city. Amman also hosts the Jordan Rally, which form part of the FIA World Rally Championship, becoming one of the largest sporting events ever held in Jordan.\nAmman is home to a growing number of foreign sports such as skateboarding and rugby; the latter has two teams based in the city: Amman Citadel Rugby Club and Nomads Rugby Club. In 2014, German non-profit organization Make Life Skate Life completed construction of the 7Hills Skatepark, a 650 square meter concrete skatepark located at Samir Rifai park in Downtown Amman.\n\nMedia and music\nThe majority of Jordan's radio stations are based in Amman. The first radio station to originate in the city was Hunna Amman in 1959; it mainly broadcast traditional Bedouin music. In 2000, Amman Net became the first de facto private radio station to be established in the country, despite private ownership of radio stations being illegal at the time. After private ownership was legalized in 2002, several more radio stations were created.\n\nMost Jordanian newspapers and news stations are situated in Amman. Daily newspapers published in Amman include Alghad, Ad-Dustour, The Jordan Times, and Al Ra'i, the most circulated newspaper in the country. In 2011, Al Ra'i was ranked the 5th most popular newspaper in the Arab world by Forbes Middle-East report. Al-Arab Al-Yawm is the only daily pan-Arab newspaper in Jordan. The two most popular Jordanian TV channels, Ro'ya TV and JRTV, are based in Amman.\nAside from mainstream Arabic pop, there is a growing independent music scene in the city which includes many bands that have sizable audiences across the Arab world. Local Ammani bands along with other bands in the Middle East gather in the Roman Theater during the Al-Balad Music Festival held annually in August. Music genres of the local bands are diverse, ranging from heavy metal to Arabic Rock, jazz and rap. Performers include JadaL, Torabyeh, Bilocate, Akher Zapheer, Autostrad and El Morabba3.\n\nEvents\nMany events take place in Amman, including Red Bull-sponsored events Soundclash and Soapbox race, the second part of Jerash Festival, Al-Balad Music Festival, Amman Marathon, Made in Jordan Festival, Amman Book Festival and New Think Festival. Venues for such cultural events often include the Roman and Odeon Theaters downtown, the Ras al Ain Hanger, King Hussein Business Park, Rainbow Theater and Shams Theater, the Royal Film Commission, Shoman libraries and Darat al Funun, and the Royal Cultural Center at Sports City. In addition to large-scale events and institutional planning, scholars point to tactical urbanism as a key element of the city's cultural fabric.\n\nTransportation\nAirports\nThe main airport serving Amman is Queen Alia International Airport, situated about 30 km (18.64 mi) south of Amman. Much smaller is Amman Civil Airport, a one-terminal airport that serves primarily domestic and nearby international routes and the army. Queen Alia International Airport is the major international airport in Jordan and the hub for Royal Jordanian, the flag carrier. Its expansion was recently done and modified, including the decommissioning of the old terminals and the commissioning of new terminals costing $700M, to handle over 16 million passengers annually. It is now considered a state-of-the-art airport and was named 'the best airport in the Middle East' for 2014 and 2015 and 'the best improvement in the Middle East' for 2014 by Airport Service Quality Survey, the world's leading airport passenger satisfaction benchmark program.\n\nRoads\nAmman has an extensive road network. Eight roundabout \"circles\", which formerly marked neighborhoods, are used as landmarks. The road network includes many bridges and tunnels due to the mountainous nature of the terrain. A leading example is the Abdoun Bridge, which spans Wadi Abdoun and connects the 4th Circle to Abdoun Circle. It is considered one of Amman's many landmarks and is the first curved suspended bridge to be built in the country.\n\nSuccessive waves of refugees to the city has led to the rapid construction of new neighborhoods, but Amman's capacity for new or widened roads remains limited despite the influx. This has resulted in increasing traffic jams, particularly during summer when there are large numbers of tourists and Jordanian expatriates visiting. In 2015, a ring road encompassing the city was constructed, which aims to connect the northern and southern parts of the city in order for traffic to be diverted outside Amman and to improve the environmental conditions in the city.\n\nBus and taxi\nThe city has frequent bus connections to other cities in Jordan, as well as to major cities in neighboring countries; the latter are also served by service taxis. Internal transport is served by a number of bus routes and taxis. Service taxis, which most often operate on fixed routes, are readily available and inexpensive. The two main bus and taxi stations are Abdali (near the King Abdullah Mosque, the Parliament and Palace of Justice) and the Raghadan Central Bus Station near the Roman theater in the city center. Popular Jordanian bus company services include JETT and Al-Mahatta. Taxis are the most common way to get around in Amman due their high availability and inexpensiveness.\nThe Amman Bus and the Amman Bus Rapid Transit public transportation systems currently serve the city. Construction work on the BRT system started in 2010, but was halted soon after amid feasibility concerns. Resuming in 2015, the first route of the BRT system was inaugurated in 2021, and the second in 2022. Another BRT route connecting Amman with Zarqa started operations in May 2024.\nThe BRT system in Amman runs on 2 routes: the first from Sweileh in northwest Amman to the Ras Al-Ain area next to downtown Amman, and the second from Sweileh to Mahatta terminal in eastern Amman. Both routes meet at the Sports City intersection. The first route is currently served by three lines: 98, 99 and 100. Ticket price for all lines of Amman Bus and Amman BRT are bought either online via the Amman Bus mobile application or as a rechargeable card in major terminals. Passengers scan their cards or QR codes on phone when boarding the bus, where the price ticket is subtracted from the available balance. The buses are air-conditioned, accessible, monitored with security cameras and have free internet service.\n\nEducation\nAmman is a major regional center of education. The Amman region hosts Jordan's highest concentration of education centers. There are 20 universities in Amman. The University of Jordan is the largest public university in the city. There are 448 private schools in the city attended by 90,000 students, including Jubilee School, Amman Baccalaureate School, Amman Academy, Amman National School, Modern American School, American Community School in Amman, and National Orthodox School.\nUniversities include:\n\nUniversity of Jordan\nAl-Ahliyya Amman University\nAl-Isra University\nAl-Zaytoonah University of Jordan\nAmman Arab University\nApplied Science University\nArab Academy for Banking and Financial Sciences\nArab Open University\nColumbia University: Amman Branch\nGerman-Jordanian University: Amman Branch\nJordan Academy for Maritime Studies\nJordan Academy of Music\nJordan Institute of Banking Studies\nJordan Media Institute\nMiddle East University\nUniversity of Petra\nPhiladelphia University\nPrincess Sumaya University for Technology\nQueen Noor Civil Aviation Technical College\nWorld Islamic Sciences and Education University\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nAmman is twinned with:\n\nGallery\nSee also\nEarly Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East\nRabbath Ammon\nPhiladelphia\nDowntown Amman\nAmman Citadel\nSeil Amman\nList of tallest buildings in Amman\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nAmman Digital Community Facebook page\nGreater Amman Municipality Facebook page\nAmman public transportation map\nPhotos of Amman from the American Center of Research",
      "summary": "Amman is the capital and the largest city of Jordan, and the country's economic, political, and cultural center. With a population of five million as of 2024, Amman is Jordan's primate city and is the largest city in the Levant region, the fifth-largest city in the Arab world, and the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East.\nAmman is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman dates to the 8th millennium BC in 'Ain Ghazal, home to the world's oldest statues of the human form. During the Iron Age, the city was known as Rabat Aman, the capital of the Ammonite Kingdom. In the 3rd century BC, the city was renamed Philadelphia and became one of the ten Greco-Roman cities of the Decapolis. Later, in the 7th century AD, the Rashidun Caliphate renamed the city Amman. Throughout most of the Islamic era, the city alternated between periods of devastation and periods of relative prosperity. Amman was largely abandoned during the Ottoman period from the 15th century until 1878, when it was resettled by Circassians. The city grew after it was connected to the Hejaz Railway in 1904, leading to the formation of its first municipal council in 1909.\nAmman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan's capital in 1921, receiving migrations from different Jordanian and Levantine cities, and later several successive waves of refugees: Palestinians in 1948 and 1967; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003; and Syrians since 2011. It was initially built on seven hills, but now spans over 19 hills combining 22 areas, which are administered by the Greater Amman Municipality. Areas of Amman have gained their names from either the hills (jabal) or the valleys (wadi) they occupy, such as Jabal al-Luweibdeh and Wadi Abdoun. East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities, while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city.\nApproximately one million visitors arrived in Amman in 2018, which made it the 89th most-visited city in the world and the 12th most-visited Arab city. Amman has a relatively fast growing economy and it is ranked as a Beta− global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Moreover, it was named one of the Middle East and North Africa's best cities according to economic, labor, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. The city is among the most popular locations in the Arab world for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices, alongside Doha and only behind Dubai. Amman has a bus network, including a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system that serves the city and connects it to neighboring Zarqa.",

      "content": "عَمَّان هي عاصمة المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية ومركز محافظة العاصمة. تُعد أكبر مدن المملكة وواحدة من أكبر المدن العربية بالنسبة لعدد السكان، إذ بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2023 حوالي 4.8 مليون نسمة، مما يجعلها أيضًا واحدة من أسرع المدن نموًا بالسكان بالعالم. تقع المدينة في وسط المملكة على دائرة عرض 31 شمالاً وخط طول 35 شرقًا في منطقة تكثر فيها الجبال، فنشأت في الوديان بين الجبال أولاً فضاقت على سكانها، فارتقوا سفوحها واستمروا في الاتساع عبر قممها حتى انتشرت المدينة بأطرافها فوق 20 جبلا.\nتُعتبر عمّان المركز التجاري والإداري للأردن وقلبه الاقتصادي والتعليمي، حيث أصبحت عمّان نقطة استقطاب للكثير من الجاليات العربية لموقعها المتميز ولعمارتها المعاصرة، كما تستقطب عمّان الكثير من السياح سنويًا من أوروبا الغربية وأمريكا الشمالية واليابان وإستراليا ومن الدول العربية المجاورة والقريبة، وكثيرًا من عائلات دول الخليج العربي تحديدًا، إذ تكثر بها المعالم السياحية عمومًا والعلاجية الطبية خصوصاً. كان من نتيجة وقوع عمّان في مثل هذا الموقع الاستراتيجي في بلاد الشام والشرق الأوسط، أن أصبح موقعها يتحكم بالاقتصاد الوطني ويُحرّك 90% من الاستثمار على المستوى الوطني.\nيرجع تاريخ مدينة عمّان إلى الألف السابع قبل الميلاد، وبهذا تُعتبر من ضمن أقدم مدن العالم المأهولة بالسكان إلى يومنا هذا. وعمّان مدينة قديمة أقيمت على أنقاض مدينة عرفت باسم «ربّة عمّون» ثم «فيلادلفيا» ثم «عمّان» اشتقاقاً من «ربة عمّون»، واتخذها العمّونيون عاصمة لهم. وقد أُنشئت المدينة على تلال سبعة، وكانت مركزًا للمنطقة على ما يبدو في ذلك الوقت، وهي إحدى عواصم بلاد الشام الأربع، وهي أيضًا إحدى المدن الشامية القديمة التي أصبحت عاصمةً لإمارة شرق الأردن ومن ثم المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية بعد استقلالها في العام 1946 عن بريطانيا.\nيسكن عمّان الحديثة مجموعة متنوعة من السكان من أصول مختلفة أتوا من مختلف المناطق، منهم من أتى من مدن أردنية قريبة، ومنهم من أتى من فلسطين، ومنهم من القوقاز وسوريا والعراق.\nشهدت أمانة عمان الكبرى مؤخرًا تطورًا كبيرًا، حيث توسعت عمان بشكل لم تشهده المدينة من قبل. ونالت خطة مدينة عمّان الشمولية جوائز عالمية منها جائزة القيادة العالمية في تخطيط المدن وجائزة المدينة عن قارة آسيا لعام 2007. يبلغ عدد المناطق الإدارية في أمانة عمان 22 منطقة مُوزعة جغرافيا تحوي كل منطقة طاقمًا متكاملا من الموظفين، أما من الناحية الإدارية فهناك مجلس أمانة عمان الكبرى الذي يضم 68 عضوا برئاسة أمين العاصمة، والمجلس مقسم بدوره إلى 14 لجنة مختلفة.\nيُشار بالذكر إلى أنه تم اعتماد يوم 2 آذار/ مارس من كل عام يومًا لمدينة عمّان بعد إقرار مجلس الوزراء الأردني قرارًا بذلك في بداية عام 2021، وذلك في إطار الاحتفاء بمرور 100 عام على تأسيس الدولة الأردنيّة.\n\nالتسمية والتاريخ\nالعصور القديمة\nيعود تاريخ عمّان إلى أكثر من 7000 سنة قبل الميلاد. وقد مرّت عليها حضارات عديدة دلّت عليها الآثار المنتشرة في أرجاء المدينة. وخلال هذه الفترة الطويلة، شهدت المدينة الكثير من الحضارات، كان أهمها العمونيون. يُعد المدرج الروماني أحد أكبر الآثار المتبقية في المدينة. كما يدل جبل القلعة بآثاره المختلفة يدل على الحضارات العمونية والإغريقية والرومانية والبيزنطية والأموية، بالإضافة إلى رجم الملفوف الواقع في جبل عمان والمطل على وادي صقرة وهو ما تبقى من حضارات فترة ما قبل التاريخ لعبّاد الطبيعة وعناصرها كالشمس والقمر والنجوم.\n\nيعود أول تواجد بشري في مدينة عمّان في آثار عين غزال شرق العاصمة إلى 9 آلاف عام من الآن. لقد كشفت التنقيبات على أن هذه المنطقة هي من أغنى مواقع العصر الحجري الحديث ما قبل الفخاري، كما أن القرية قد سُكنت دون انقطاع. كانت عين غزال مستوطنة زراعية ورعوية بُنيت من الحجارة غير المشذبة، وكانت المباني مستطيلة الشكل وبجدران مستقيمة، وقد رُصفت الأرضيات ثم قصرت بالجبس المدكوك حد اللمعان، وبعد ذلك تم طلائه باللون الأحمر. إن أهم ما يميز موقع عين غزال التماثيل البشرية المُكتشفة، والتي تم العثور عليها في المنطقة الوسطى للموقع على مجموعتين من التماثيل البشرية، والتي تُعد من التماثيل النادرة في العالم.\nلقد قدم إلى عمّان الحيثيون والهكسوس، ثم قبائل العماليق الأقدمين، تلتهم قبائل بني عمون، أو العمونيين، الذين أعطوا المدينة اسمهم فأطلقوا عليها في البداية اسم ربة عمّون، والربة تعني العاصمة أو دار الملك ثم سقطت مع مرور الزمن كلمة ربة وبقيت عمون حتى أطلق عليها الأمويون اسم عمّان. اتخذه العمونيون جبل القلعة مقرًا لحكمهم في المدينة، وهو مشرف على وسط عمّان حاليًا.\nقام الآشورويون بالتمدد غربًا نحو منطقة العمونيين، حيث لم يستطيعوا الوقوف بوجههم في بداية الأمر، وانضم العمونييون إلى حلف آرامي لمقاومة النفوذ الآشوري في بداية القرن التاسع قبل الميلاد، ولكن الآشوريين استطاعوا احتلال مملكة العمونيين، وقرر الملك الآشوري سنحاريب منح عمون الاستقلال الذاتي. كان للسيطرة الآشورية أثر في استتباب الأمن، مما مكّن العمونييون من السيطرة على جزء ٍ كبيرٍ من طرق القوافل التجارية. قاوم العمونيون البابليين - الذين استمروا في هجومهم على الأجزاء الجنوبية من الإمبراطورية الآشوريّة، ما أثّر سلبيًا على الوضع الاقتصادي. وفي عهد الملك نبوخذ نصر، استطاع البابليّون السيطرة عليها.\n\nورث البابليون أملاك الآشوريين في آسيا في عام 612 ق. م. وقد قام ملك مصر بغزو بلاد الشام في عام 590 ق. م، وهي فلسطين وشرقي الأردن. ثم قام نبوخذ نصر ملك البابليين آنذاك في عام 586 ق. م بسبي أهالي القدس وأعاد البلاد إلى سلطانه.\nفي عام 539 ق.م استطاع قورش الفارسي القضاء على الإمبراطورية البابلية وإقامة الإمبراطورية الفارسية، ثم استولى الفرس على فلسطين والأردن، ودخلوا عمّان، وأصبحت في تلك الفترة تحت حكم الإمبراطورية الفارسية. ولقد منح الفرس عمّان حكمًا ذاتيًا في الفترة ما بين 540 ـ 332 ق. م، إلا أن الإغريق قَضوا على دولة الفرس عام 332 ق.م، وبدأت فترة الإمبراطورية اليونانية.\nسيطر الإغريق البطالسة على المنطقة بما فيها ربة عمون، التي أبدل اسمها بطليموس الثاني عام 285 ق.م إلى اسم «فيلادلفيا»- ويعني مدينة الحب الأخوي؛\nنسبة للقائد «فيلادلفيوس» وجعل من جبل القلعة موقعا للمعابد كجبل الأكروبولس في أثينا. انتعشت في هذا العهد منطقة عراق الأمير، نسبة لقصر الملك طوبيا المعروف بعراق الأمير، أو قصر العبد.\nانقسمت عمان لتصبح جزءاً من الدولتين النبطية والسلوقية إلى أن استولى عليها الملك الروماني «هيرودس» في العام 30 ق.م. وبهذا تدخل المدينة العهد الروماني ومن ثم البيزنطي حتى منصف القرن السابع.\nالعصر الروماني والبيزنطي\n\nامتد العهد الروماني ثم البيزنطي من 63 - 636. وأصبحت المدينة جزءًا من حلف الديكابولس، وهو تحالف كان يضم عشرة مدن تقع اليوم في الأردن وسوريا وفلسطين. لقد أُعيد بناء فيلادلفيا أيام الحكم الروماني لتشمل مدرج وشوارع مرصوفة وأعمدة على الطراز الروماني. أيام الحكم البيزنطي كانت مقر الكرسي المسيحي وبُنيَت الكثير من الكنائس ولكن المدينة لم تعد مزدهرة كما كانت. وقد وصلها الفرس في عام 614م وأعادوا احتلالها، لكن حكمهم كان قصيرا وانتهى قبيل وصول جيوش المسلمين اليها بعد عدة سنوات.\nيوجد في المدينة آثار رومانية ما زالت قائمة ليومنا هذا، أهمها ساحة الفورم والمدرج الروماني. يقع الفورم بين جبل القلعة وجبل الجوفة أمام المدرج الروماني بوسط عمان. تبلغ مساحة الفورم والمسرح ما مجموعه 7600 متر مربع ويعود تاريخ بنائهما على الأرجح إلى القرن الثاني الميلادي وتحديدًا بين عامي 138م و 161م إبان عهد القيصر أنطونيوس بيوس. اليوم بني إلى جانب الفورم حديقة ذات نوافير عدة، تستعمل كمأوى للهروب من أزمة المرور وزحمة التسوق في وسط مدينة عمان. كانت الساحة محاطة من ثلاث جهات بشوراع أعمدة، التي يشاهد المرء منها اليوم فقط الأعمدة الواقعة في الجزء الجنوبي من الساحة، المتاخمة للمدرج. بنى الرومان، نظام تصريف للمياه تحت الساحة.\nأما البيزنطيون فيتركون كنائس عدة، حيث كشفت حفريات دائرة الآثار العامة في عمّان، عن كنائس تعود إلى فترة القرن الرابع الميلادي وحتى الثامن، أثناء حكم البيزنطيين للمنطقة في ضواحي المدينة في كل من: الصويفية، خلدا، الرابية، الجبيهة، ياجوز، البصة، القويسمة، رجم الكرسي، اللويبدة في دارة الفنون، حسبان التي تبعد عن عمان 20 كيلو مترا، والجبل الأخضر.\n\nالعصر الإسلامي\nبدأ هذا العصر بعد الفتح الإسلامي للشام في 635، واستطاع جيش يزيد بن أبي سفيان أن يفتح عمّان، وتنتهي بذلك دولة الغساسنة التابعة للبيزنطيين، والمتحكمة بمنطقة البلقاء التي كانت عمان جزءا منها، وعادت المدينة لتُعرف باسمها السامي القديم ثانية: عمّان أو عمّون.\n\nفي العصر الأموي، بنى الأمويون قصرًا كبيرًا على جبل القلعة، وغدت عمّان مركزًا إداريًا، يقيم فيها الأمير، وتضرب فيها النقود، وتقوم حاميتها بمراقبة طريق القوافل التجارية، وحراسة طريق الحج، وبرك الماء كبركة زيزاء والقسطل. وعندما آلت الأمور إلى الدولة العباسية، جرت على أرض كورة عمان (مركز اداري) معارك دُمّرت فيها الأسوار والحصون في مواجهة عسكرية داخلية. ويشير المؤرخون إلى أن العباسيين تحصنوا في عمّان عندما ثار بعض الأمويين مطالبين بالخلافة في عهد الخليفة المأمون بن الرشيد.\n\nكانت عمّان في عهد الفاطميين مركزًا لتجميع القوات، ولكن في أواخر حكمهم في القرن الحادي عشر الميلادي بدأت الضغوط الخارجية بقدوم الصليبيين. وفي سنة 1184 مر صلاح الدين الأيوبي بعمّان في طريقه إلى الكرك، وأصبحت في تلك الفترة جزءًا من دولة الايوبيين. أمّا في عهد المماليك، فقد شهدت عمان إستقرارًا، وازدهرت أسواقها في مواسم الحج. لقد حظيت عمّان باهتمام الظاهر بيبرس ورعايته عندما اعتلى عرش دولة المماليك في مصر والشام. وفي عهد السلطان قلاوون عام 1279، انتقلت الولاية من السلط إلى عمّان، وفي عام 1355 بنى المماليك مدرسة في عمان لتدريس المذهب الحنفي.\nفي عام 1516 توالى على حكم الإمبراطورية العثمانية عدد من السلاطين، واستطاع الأتراك العثمانيون دخول عمّان، إلا أنها بعد ذلك دخلت دفتر النسيان والإهمال حتى نهاية القرن التاسع عشر، نتيجة لعدة زلازل ضربتها وانتشار الأوبئة مثل الطاعون، حيث بدأت منذ 1878، تشهد تزايدًا في أعداد السكان، إذ قامت السلطات العثمانية بالسماح لعدد من العائلات الشركسية (المهاجرة من اضطهاد القيصر الروسي) بالسكن في عمّان. وتجدر الإشارة إلى أن متحف الآثار الأردني به نماذج من أثار هذه الحضارات كلها عبر عصورها المتتالية.\nقال عنها المقدسي في كتابه: «أحسن التقاسيم في معرفة الأقاليم»، أن مدينة عمّان هي واحدة من ضمن ثلاث مدن تشبه مكة، حيث يقول: «رأيت لها ثلاث نظائر: عمّان بالشام، وإصطخر بفارس، وقرية الحمراء بخراسان». وقد جاء ذكر عمّان في كتب أدب الرحلات العربية، فقد أورد عنها في كتاب معجم البلدان لياقوت الحموي ثلاث أبيات شعر قال فيها الأحوص بن محمد الأنصاري:\n\nعمّان الحديثة\nتأسست عمّان الحديثة في نهاية القرن التاسع عشر مع وصول طلائع المهاجرين الشركس من قبائل الشابسوغ ليستقروا قرب سيل عمان والمدرج الروماني عام 1878، نتيجة تهجيرهم القسري بالقوة المسلحة من قبل القوات الروسية القيصرية التي استطاعت إكمال احتلال وطنهم الأم شمال القوقاز عام 1864 بعد قتال شركسي ضد هذه القوات التي كانت تعتبر من أقوى الجيوش الأوروبية طيلة ما يزيد عن مئة عام. ثم عملت على تفريغ وطنهم القومي التاريخي بتهجيرهم إلى الدولة العثمانية المجاورة، لإحلال مستوطنين من الشعوب الموالية للروس كالقوزاق والجورجيين والأوكرانيين الروس أنفسهم. كانت شرق الأردن إحدى المناطق العثمانية في ذلك الوقت والتي أنزلت فيها الدولة العثمانية الشراكسة المهجّرين، وكانت عمّان المدينة الأثرية أولى مناطق الأردن التي نزل فيها الشراكسة منذ عام 1878. كان هؤلاء المهاجرون الشراكسة من الفلاحين الذين عملوا على زراعة الأرض وتربية الماشية وبناء بيوتهم ومساجدهم، حيث وزعت عليهم السلطات العثمانية الأراضي الصالحة للزراعة، مما أنعش القرية وأعاد إليها الحياة. بعد ذلك أصبحت عمان عامل جذب لقدوم المزيد من السكان إليها من مختلف الجهات. وكانت عمّان ضمن المناطق التي سُكنت لوجود المياه فيها بوفرة، وفي عام 1933، بلغ عدد الشركس فيها 1,700 نسمة.\nلقد توالت على عمان مجموعات أخرى من المهاجرين الشراكسة القادمين من شمال القوقاز بعد احتلال بلادهم من قبل الجيوش الروسية القيصرية عام 1864، فسكنوا في أحياء ما زالت تحمل أسماءها حتى اليوم مثل حي المهاجرين وحي الشابسوغ وحي القبرطاي ومحلّة الأبزاخ. تتابع قدوم الناس إلى عمّان والاستقرار فيها عبر السنين التالية، فقدمت جماعات من الأرمن والأكراد والشيشان والشوام والمقدسيين والحجازيين وغيرهم مما أضفى على المجتمع الأردني تنوعا عرقياً شكل جزءا هاما من نسيجه.\nلقد عزمت الدولة العثمانية في نهاية القرن التاسع على إنشاء ولاية في المنطقة يكون مركزها عمان. وقد جاء في مشروع الولاية المقترح: «فالبلد السوري، يتكون حالياً من ولاية دمشق، وولاية بيروت، ومتصرفية القدس الشريف. غير أن هذه المنطقة شاسعة، تكاد تبلغ مساحتها نصف مساحة الأناضول. وهي مناطق عامرة، فيمكن تشكيل ولاية فيها، على أن تكون عاصمتها عمان، وأن يطلق على الولاية اسم ولاية عمّان أو معمورة الحميدية، ويُتخذ في معان والشوبك وحسبان والسلط وعين الزرقاء وباقي الأماكن قائم مقاميات». وكان السبب في اقتراح فكرة الولاية الحميدية أن تشكيل ولاية عمّان سيعمل على ضمان الأمن على الطريق التي تخترقها ابتداء من دمشق حتى المدينة المنورة. إذ ترافق ذلك مع تفكير الدولة العثمانية بإنشاء سكة حديد، تبدأ من دمشق وتصل إلى اليمن، على طول الساحل الشرقي للبحر الأحمر. غير أن كمال باشا، صاحب فكرة المشروع المقترح، أبدى تخوفه من أن تتعرض هذه الطريق لهجوم قوى أجنبية، كالإنجليز، الذين يحاولون احتلال مصر، مما يعرقل حركة القوات العثمانية الذاهبة إلى الحجاز واليمن.\nعلى الرغم من أن مشروع الولاية الجديدة ظل فكرة، ولم يُطبّق، إلا أنه بقي حاضرًا في أذهان السياسيين والعسكريين العثمانيين أثناء إدارتهم لهواجس ومخاطر الأمن الداخلي والخارجي. فقاموا بدءًا من العام 1878، بتشجيع استقرار الشركس والشيشان، على طول خط استراتيجي، يمتد من منبج وحمص والجولان فعمّان، حيث كانت الاضطرابات والعصيان على الدولة أمرًا مألوفًا. ولم يدرك الشركس أبعاد هذا الدور، ووجدوا أنفسهم حين وصلوا إلى البلقاء في العراء. وواجهوا المصاعب بالصبر والجهد والتحدي، معتمدين على أنفسهم. وقد بدؤوا باستصلاح الأراضي وزارعتها، وشرعوا ببناء قرى جديدة هنا وهناك، فكانت عمّان وناعور ووادي السير وصويلح وغيرها. جاء الشركس في بداية وصولهم إلى عمّان، قادمين من نابلس ومنطقة خربة الشركس التابعة للواء عكا. وكان أغلب الفوج الأول من المهاجرين الشركس، في العام 1878، يتكون من قبيلة الشابسوغ، حيث سكنوا بين الأبنية الأثرية للمدينة، وفي دهاليز المدرج الروماني والكهوف المحيطة به.\nأسهم الخط الحديدي الحجازي في زيادة ملحوظة بعدد سكان المدينة، لا سيما عندما رُبطت به المدينة عبر محطة عمان التي تبعد عن مركز المدينة خمسة كيلومترات، وذلك عام 1903. لذلك أخذت أوضاع عمّان السكانية والاقتصادية تشهد تطورًا تدريجيًا بطيئًا، فأُنشئ أول مجلس بلدي في المدينة عام 1909، وغدت مركزاً لمديرية الناحية عام 1914، وقد كانت عمان قبل تأسيس الأردن الحديث سنة 1921، مركزًا مهمًا رغم قلة عدد سكانها مقارنة ببعض المدن المجاورة كالسلط ونابلس والقدس، حيث كانت أشبه بقرية كبيرة طيلة تلك الفترة. وقُدّر عدد سكانها بعد انتهاء الحرب العالمية الأولى بما بين 1500 و 2000 نسمة أو أكثر بقليل، معظمهم من الشراكسة المهاجرين، الذين تمركزوا في وسط البلد في أحياء المهاجرين والشابسوغ والقبرطاي ومحلة الأبزاخ والأشرفية وجبل التاج وأجزاء من جبل عمان.\nمئوية أمانة عمّان الكبرى\n\nاحتفلت أمانة عمان الكبرى عام 2009 بالذكرى المئوية لتأسيسها، إذ تأسس أول مجلس بلدي عام 1909 كون مسيرة المائة عام الماضية من عمر عمّان شهدت تطورًا كبيرًا في شتى الميادين، وتدرجت من قرية صغيرة إلى عاصمة حديثة ومن مجلس بلدي إلى أمانة عمان الكبرى، وتخطت العديد من الصعاب والتحديات، فضلا عن تطور مفهوم ومستوى ونوعية الخدمات التي تقدم للعمانيين.\nلقد تعاقب على رئاسة المدينة، خلال مئة عام، منذ تأسيس مجلسها البلدي الأول عام 1909 وحتى العام 2009، ثمانية عشر رئيسا للبلدية (1909-1950)، وأربعة عشر أمينًا للعاصمة (1950-1987)، وتسعة أمناء لعمّان الكبرى (1987-2015).\n\nجغرافيا\nتقع عمّان على عدة جبال، وترتفع عن سطح البحر قرابة 750 مترًا، ومتوسط ارتفاع جبالها السبع الأولى التي أُنشئت عليها 918 متر. تقع مدينة العقبة على بعد 360 كيلومترًا جنوبها، ومدينة إربد على مسافة تقارب من 80 كيلومترًا شمالها. بينما يقع نهر الأردن على مسافة 45 كيلومترًا إلى الغرب منها. أما عن مدن الجوار فتبعد القدس عنها بمسافة 80 كيلومترًا إلى الغرب، ودمشق مسافة 180 كيلومترًا إلى الشمال، وبغداد مسافة 800 كيلومترًا إلى الشرق، أما مكة المكرمة فتقع على مسافة 1225 كيلومترًا إلى الجنوب.\n\nالتضاريس\nتمتد عمّان بشكل رئيسي فوق عشرين جبلاً تقريبًا على طول المدينة وعرضها ومن أهم جبالها السبعة الأوائل وهي جبل القصور، جبل الجوفة، جبل التاج، جبل النزهة، جبل النصر، جبل الأشرفية، جبل النظيف، والجبل الأخضر. بالإضافة إلى جبل عمان وجبل اللويبدة وجبل الحسين وجبل القلعة. معظمها موجود الآن ضمن عمان الشرقية، وتتنوع في المدينة التضاريس كالتالي:\n\nالمنطقة الشمالية، وتتكون من عدة جبال متموّجة نوعًا ما، كما في الجبيهة وشفا بدران وأبو نصير.\nالمنطقة الوسطى، تتميز بأنها ملتقى الأودية مع سيل عمان، وهي أودية شديدة الانحدار تتخللها النتوءات الصخرية البارزة وطبقات صخرية متموّجة على سفوح الجبال التي تمر من خلالها، مثل وادي عبدون ووادي صقرة ووادي الحدادة.\nالمنطقة الغربية، تمتد على جانب غور الأردن، ويتجاوز ارتفاعها 1000 متر كما في تلاع العلي والشميساني وصويلح.\nالمنطقة الشرقية والجنوبية الشرقية، وتتميز بسطحها المتموج، وتعد من الأراضي الصحراوية القاحلة الممتدة إلى الصحراء الأردنية، كما في ماركا الجنوبية والقويسمة.\n\nتنظيم المدينة\nتنقسم عمان إلى جزئين رئيسيين وهما:\n\nعمان الشرقية وهي الجزء الأقدم من المدينة.\nعمان الغربية وهي الجزء الأحدث من المدينة.\nكانت عمان مقتصرة على الشركس في نهايات القرن التاسع عشر وحتى بداية القرن العشرين، ولكن بعد إعلانها عاصمة لإمارة شرق الأردن ومن بعدها المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية ازداد التوسع العمراني ووفِدَ إليها الناس من مختلف المناطق، وبدأت مدينة عمان الحديثة بالتوسع في عقد الخمسينات والستينات من القرن الماضي حيث أخذت أحياء جديدة في الظهور في عمان الغربية.\nفي بداية عام 2007 قررت أمانة عمان الكبرى، ضم أراض قريبة من مطار الملكة علياء الدولي جنوب العاصمة، لتصبح جزءا من مناطق المدينة، مثل الجيزة ومرج الحمام وسحاب، مما ضاعف مساحة عمان لتصبح 1,680 كم². وضمن الخطة للسنوات المقبلة، تتجه الأمانة إلى التوسع العمراني نحو المناطق الشرقية والجنوبية حيث سهولة استغلال الأراضي المنبسطة. وضمن المخططات لتوفير الخدمات لهذه المناطق الجديدة تستعد الأمانة لإقامة مشروع خط قطارات خفيفة بين المناطق الجنوبية لعمّان وصولا إلى الزرقاء شرقا على امتداد 26 كيلومتر.\nكما شهدت عمّان الغربية نموا سريعا في العقدين الأخيرين حيث ظهرت أحياء بأكملها. وتحاول أمانة عمّان إقامة مشاريع تنموية طموحة في شرق عمّان خلال الفترة الحالية.\n مناطق عمان\nالقائمة التالية بأسماء مناطق عمان الكبرى الاثنان والعشرين والتي تقع ضمن عمان الغربية وعمان الشرقية:\n\nالغطاء الأخضر\n\nتتنوع التضاريس في مناطق عمّان الريفية بين السهول والجبال العالية والوديان، وتحيط الأماكن السياحية بجميع أنحاء العاصمة حيث منتزه عمّان القومي وحدائق البحرين والمدينة المائية جنوبا، مرورا بالطبيعة الجميلة في وادي السير وأم الأسود والحمر وماحص غربا، وانتهاء بقرى زي ودبين شمالا.\nيكاد يخلو وسط مدينة عمّان من الغابات فيما عدا بعض الأماكن مثل المدينة الرياضية والجامعة الأردنية وحدائق الحسين، وحدائق الملك عبد الله بالمقابلين، وغابات أخرى على طريق المطار.\nيُشار إلى أن زراعة الغابات قد بدأت في الأردن منذ أكثر من 60 عاماً مضت. وتجري معظم أنشطة التشجير حول العاصمة والمدن السكنية بالإضافة إلى زراعات جوانب الطرق، ومصدّات الرياح والزراعات في مجاري الوديان. تُزرع الأشجار أيضاً كجزء متكامل من نظم مندمجات الزراعة والغابات.\nفي عام 1995 تضمنت الزراعات حوالي 1000 كيلومتر من الأشجار على طول الطرق، 7000 كيلومتر من مصدات الرياح وأحزمة الوقاية و 500 كيلومتر من الأشجار على طول جوانب المجاري المائية.\n\nالمناخ\nالطقس في عمّان معتدل بشكل عام، إذ يسود مناخ متوسطي معظم مناطق العاصمة، خصوصًا في المرتفعات. بينما يسود بعض مناطقها المناخ شبه الصحراوي وخاصة في المناطق الشرقية منها. ترتفع درجات الحرارة صيفًا، وتصل أعلى مستوياتها في منتصف آب/ أغسطس، حيث تصل في بعض الأحيان إلى منتصف الثلاثينات مئوية. وتنخفض الحرارة شتاء لتصل في كانون الثاني/ يناير أحيانًا إلى الصفر أو ما دونه، حيث يتسبب ذلك بتساقط الثلوج على المرتفعات. ويعتدل المناخ في فصلي الربيع والخريف.\nأما بالنسبة لمعدلات الأمطار فتكون معدومة في بعض الأشهر مثل حزيران وتموز وآب. بينما تكون في أعلى معدلاتها في شهري كانون الثاني وشباط، حيث يمكن أن يصل مستواها إلى أكثر من 170 ميليمترًا.\n\nالسكان\nيعود أول تواجد بشري في مدينة عمّان إلى 9 الآف عام، حيث تشير آثار عين غزال شرق العاصمة إلى هذا. وخلال هذه الفترة الطويلة، شهدت المدينة الكثير من الحضارات كان أهمها العمونيون، وبعد ذلك احتل المدينة كل من اليونان والفرس والرومان والبيزنطيون. وبعد الفتح الإسلامي لبلاد الشام استمر التواجد البشري فيها حتى دخلت دفتر النسيان في نهاية العصر المملوكي أي في القرن السادس عشر، إلى أن تم إعادة اكتشافها في نهاية القرن التاسع عشر، وهجرة شعوب مختلفة من القوقاز، الذين تعرض كل منهم لاضطهاد في بلاده، فقامت الدولة العثمانية بتوزيعهم على أراضيها، وكانت عمان من هذه الأراضي. وبهذا، يبدأ تاريخ التواجد البشري في عمان الحديثة، حيث بدأت الحياة تدب في عمّان المعاصرة شيئا فشيئا بعد هجرة الشركس في بادئ الأمر من القوقاز عام 1880 أو قبله بقليل، وخاصة إلى محلتي الشابسوغ والمهاجرين، ومن ثم هجرة كل من الأرمن والشيشان. ثم مالبثت أن استقبلت المدينة الكثير من العرب من مختلف المناطق، وبالأخص ذوي الأصول الأردنية (الذين سكن بعضهم تجمعات محددة، مثل حي الطفايلة الذي يعد أكبر تجمعي لأبناء المحافظات في العاصمة ويقع في جبل الجوفة)، مع المواطنين ذوي الأصول الفلسطينية الذين هاجروا من مختلف مناطق فلسطين، والذين تزايدوا بشكل كبير، حتى أصبح العرب هم الغالبية المطلقة.\n\nالتركيبة السكانية\nتعتبر عمّان من أكثر المدن تسارعا بالنمو في منطقة الشرق الأوسط، ويقطنها مايزيد عن ثلث سكان المملكة. ويبلغ عدد سكان عمّان الكبرى بضواحيها اليوم حوالي 4 ملايين نسمة، يدين الغالبية الساحقة منهم بالإسلام. كما يُعتبر المسيحيون من العرب والأرمن وغيرهم، المكون الديني الثاني بعد المسلمين، ويشكلون ما نسبته 6% من السكان من مختلف الطوائف. كما يكفل الدستور الأردني للجميع حرية ممارسة الأديان. يُشار إلى أن عدد سكان المدينة قد ازداد بشكل ملحوظ بعد عدة منعطفات مهمة شهدتها المنطقة كان أولها حرب 1948 وحرب 1967، حيث لجأ ونزح مئات الآلاف من فلسطين. كما كان لأحداث حرب الخليج الثانية دور كبير بازدياد العدد، حيث عاد مئات الآلاف من الأردنيين من الكويت وباقي دول الخليج بين عاميّ 1991 و 1992. هذا بالإضافة إلى تضاعف مساحة المدينة بعد ضم ضواحي كبيرة إليها في عام 2007 (شكلت عمّان الكبرى). كما يشكل اليوم المقيمون العرب من الدول المجاورة، وخاصة من سوريا والعراق، جزءًا لا بأس به من سكان المدينة، والذين ازدادت أعدادهم بشكل كبير بعد كل من الغزو الأمريكي للعراق والأزمة السورية. بالإضافة إلى وجود مئات الآلاف من العمّال والعاملات المقيمين من الدول الآسيوية ومصر. كما تتواجد جاليات غربية عديدة، يوجد لمعظمها معاهد ثقافية ومدارس أكاديمية. قدّرت أمانة عمان الكبرى أن عدد سكان المدينة، دون القرى التابعة لها، سيصل سنة 2025 إلى حوالي 6.4 مليون نسمة، أي ثلاثة أضعاف الرقم لعام 2007.\nإن المجتمع العمّاني حاليًا هو خليط من عائلات ذات أصول مختلفة؛ شرق أردنية، وفلسطينية، وحجازية، وسورية، وأقلية من الشركس والشيشان والأرمن والتركمان والأكراد. ولقد ظهر من هذا المكون الكثير من المشاهير الذين ساهموا بنهضة المدينة والبلد بشكل عام على جميع الأصعدة والمجالات، كالأدب والفنون والهندسة والطب والرياضة والإعلام والاقتصاد والتكنلوجيا والتعليم والسياسة والجيش.\nباستثناء بعض من عشائر البلقاء (كاللوزي وأبو قورة والعبد اللات والعدوان)، فلا يوجد فعليا مِن سكّان عمّان مَن هم ذو أصول عمّانية، ولكن هناك أجيال نشأت منذ ما يزيد عن قرن بعد هجرة مئات الآلاف من هذه المناطق المجاورة، ومن ضمنها المدن الأردنية القريبة كالسلط وإربد والطفيلة والكرك ومعان. يأتي هذا بعد خلو المدينة تقريبا من سكانها لعدة قرون - منذ القرن السادس عشر، نتيجة للزلازل وانتشار الأوبئة كالطاعون، بالإضافة إلى إهمال العثمانيين لها في معظم فترة حكمهم لـبلاد الشام.\n\nاللاجئون\nكانت عمّان تستقبل المزيد من السكان عبر العقود الستة الماضية من دول ابتلي أهلها بالحروب والثورات. وقد استقبلت المدينة كغيرها من مدن الأردن العديد من اللاجئين من دول الجوار خلال أزمات القرن الماضي وبالأخص من فلسطين ولبنان والعراق وسوريا. يطيب للبعض البقاء والاستقرار في عمّان ويختار البعض الآخر العودة إلى بلاده عند استقرار الأمور فيها أو متابعة الهجرة إلى دول أخرى. ينصهر الكثيرون في المجتمع العمّاني ولكن تبقى فئة في تجمعات سكانية تحمل هويتهم الأصلية كمخيمات اللاجئين الفلسطينيين. فبالرغم من الانصهار الكبير الذي حدث ببينهم وبين معظم فئات المجتمع إلا أنه لا زال عدد منهم يعيش في المخيمات. وبحسب إحصاءات وكالة الغوث التابعة للأمم المتحدة، يقطن هذه المخيمات قرابة 20% من فلسطينيي الأردن. تقوم وكالة الغوث، أو الأونروا، بالإشراف على جميع المخيمات العشرة في المملكة والتي تشمل مخيمات عمان الأربعة منذ النكبة، وهي مخيم البقعة ومخيم الوحدات ومخيم ماركا (شنلر) ومخيم الحسين.\nيُشار بالذكر إلى أن المدينة تستضيف مئات اللاجئين من دول بعيدة نسبيًا، كالصومال والسودان وجنوب السودان، حيث يتواجد على أرض الأردن بشكل عام 44 جنسية لاجئة حسب تقرير نشرته المفوضية السامية للأمم المتحدة لشؤون اللاجئين عام 2014.\n\nالمواصلات والاتصالات\nالنقل والطرق\nشكّل التخطيط المدني القديم لعمّان تحديا لمواكبة تطورات العصر واحتياجات المدينة، وعمّان ليست بالمدينة الثرية، ولكنها تمكنت من تخطي الصعاب وما زالت تُنشئ طرقا جديدة تحل أزمات المدينة السابقة. إذ توجد الآن في عمّان عدة طرق سريعة، تربط أجزاء المدينة بعضها ببعض كما تربطها بمدن المملكة الأخرى، فهناك شارع الأردن وشارع الاستقلال وشارع الشهيد والحزام الدائري وطريق ياجوز وشارع المدينة الطبية وشارع الجامعة وأوتوستراد الزرقاء وشارع المطار، والطريق الصحراوي. ويعتبر جسر عبدون المعلق ونفق وادي الحدادة وطريق عمان التنموي وغيرها من منشآت الطرق الجديدة من أهم مشاريع أمانة عمان الكبرى للتخفيف من وطأة الزحام في الشوارع.\n\nبدأت أمانة عمّان الكبرى مشروع الباص السريع (BRT) في عام 2010. تعتبر شبكة الحافلات السريعة من أهم مشاريع النقل التي تشهدها عمّان حتى يومنا هذا، إذ يهدف هذا المشروع - والذي انتهى تنفيذ مرحلته الأولى في عام 2012 إلا أن حكومة رئيس الوزراء معروف البخيت أوقفت المرحلة الثانية منه لوجود شبهة فساد - إلى إحداث نقلة نوعيّة في واقع الحركة والتنقّل في المدينة – نقلة تمهّد الطريق للوصول إلى مدينة عصرية مستدامة قابلة للحياة. إن فكرة خط الباصات السريعة تعتمد على تخصيص مسارب لحركة باصات النقل العام، ويحظر على المركبات الأخرى استخدام هذه المسارب. وبذلك يمكن نقل أعداد كبيرة من الناس من خلال هذه المسارب بسرعة وسهولة. ويمكن أن تصل سعة النقل لكل مسرب حوالي 40,000 راكب في الساعة في كل اتجاه، بينما لا تتجاوز سعة النقل في المسارب التقليدية التي تستخدمها السيارات والحافلات والمركبات الأخرى الـ 3,250 راكباً. وبالإضافة إلى ذلك، فإن تكلفة بناء خطوط الباصات السريعة مقبولة جداً، وقد لا تتجاوز 5% من تكلفة بناء نظام نقل يعتمد على السكك الحديدية مثلاً. كذلك استهلاكها للطاقة وكمية الانبعاثات الكلية الناجمة عن النقل بالباصات أقل من تلك الناتجة عن النقل بالسيارات العادية. إلاّ أن المشروع قد أثار جدلا كبيرا في الفترة الحالية بعد توقفه، مما سبّب باتهامات شعبية كثيرة للقائمين عليه.\n\nأما خدمات النقل التقليدية في عمان فهي موزعة بين الحافلات والسيارات، وهناك شبكة من السيارات للنقل العام تدعى «سرفيس» أي أنها تسير في خطوط محددة ويتشارك الركاب باستخدامها ودفع أجرتها. كما يوجد شبكة من سيارات الأجرة التي تلبي الطلبات الخاصة موزعة في جميع أنحاء المدينة. ذلك عدا عن السيارات السياحية التي تُؤجر ليقودها السائح بنفسه. هذا بالإضافة إلى خدمة التاكسي المميز، وخدمة النقل باستخدام التطبيقات الذكية (مثل تطبيقات كريم وأوبر). كما أن شبكات الحافلات ضمن خدمات النقل العام تؤدي الغرض نفسه. ويوجد في المدينة مجمعان كبيران للحافلات هي مجمع باصات الشمال، والمجمع الجنوبي.\n\nالاتصالات\nنهجت الأردن في مجال الاتصالات بصورة مقبولة فمن شبكة كادت أن تكون غير مجدية في الثمانينات إلى خصخصة الاتصالات، واليوم هناك عدة شركات خاصة تقدم خدمة الإنترنت وثلاث شركات لتقديم خدمة الهاتف المحمول وشبكة اتصالات أرضية متميزة ووفرة في أرقام الهاتف.\n\nالطيران\nلعمّان مطاران: مطار الملكة علياء الدولي الذي أُنجز عام 1983 ومطار عمان المدني الذي يُستخدم للطيران المدني الإقليمي وللطيران العسكري. وهذان المطاران تنطلق منهما عدة خطوط طيران، وشركة طيران الملكية الأردنية تستخدم مطار الملكة علياء كما تستخدمه جميع شركات الطيران الدولي الأخرى. أما شركة طيران الأردنية فتستخدم مطار عمان وكذلك شركات الطيران التي تطير ضمن الإقليم فقط. يشار بالذكر إلى أنه تم رفع القدرة الاستيعابية لمطار الملكة علياء من 3.2 مليون مسافر /السنة إلى 9 ملايين عند اكتمال أعمال الإنشاءات عام 2012 ليصبح واحدا من أهم الوجهات العالمية في المنطقة.\n\nسكة الحديد\nيمر بالمدينة خط سكة حديد الحجاز حيث توجد محطة عمان على الخط بين بلاد الشام ومكة المكرمة انطلاقاً من دمشق والذي توقف العمل به منذ بدايات القرن العشرين، ويُعتبر المبنى الأثري للمحطة من معالم عمّان التاريخية. وتقع المحطة في منطقة عمان الشرقية غرب منطقة ماركا وشرق المدرج الروماني بالقرب من مطار ماركا الدولي. يُستخدم هذا الخط الآن لنقل الركاب والبضائع بين عمّان ودمشق فقط. ويعمل الأردن على الاستفادة من بعض أملاك هذا الخط في بناء مشروع آخر يعود جزء من أرباحه على الخط الحجازي، حيث سيمتد مشروع خط قطارات خفيفة بين المناطق الجنوبية لعمّان وصولاً إلى الزرقاء شرقاً والذي سيمتد لمسافة 26 كيلومتر.\n\nالعمارة والتخطيط الحضري\nالتخطيط العمراني\nاتبعت المدينة في نموها العشوائي في بادئ الأمر، نظرية النمو حول نواة واحدة، حيث كانت هذه النواة هي المسجد الحسيني والمنطقة التجارية الممتدة من راس العين إلى موقع المكتبة الوطنية (مقر أمانة عمّان القديم) وعلى جانبي وادي سيل عمّان. إلا أن عملية النمو لم تكن حلقية أو دائرية حول النواة، بل تميزت بإضافة قطاعات متفاوتة المساحة في المرحلة الواحدة ومختلفة في اتجاهات نموها خلال المراحل المختلفة. حيث كان نمو المدينة يأتي على شكل تشنجات مفاجئة نتجت عن عوامل سياسية مرت بها المنطقة، أدت إلى انفجارات سكانية غير متوقعة. حيث أثرت بدورها على الطابع المعماري للمدينة والذي تكوّن بشكل تراكمي طيلة القرن الفائت. إن التوسع الذي شهدته عمّان في هذه المرحلة كان باتجاهين: الأول على الطريق الواصل بين وسط البلد ووادي السير، والثانية بين وسط البلد والسلط عن طريق صويلح، حيث رُبطت هاتان المنطقتان بعمّان. وعلى طول مسار هذين الطريقين انتشرت دواوير عمّان وميادينها، التي هي شاهد على مراحل تطور المدينة.\nفي عام 1956، وُضِّع أول مخطط هيكلي لعمّان بمعناه الصحيح، يحدد شكل المدينة ووظائفها والاستعمالات المختلفة وخطوط النقل والمواصلات وغيرها من الخصائص العامة. وفي عام 1964 باشرت أمانة العاصمة بوضع الأنظمة التفصيلية التي ساهمت فيما بعد بتطبيق محتويات المخططات التنظيمية التي أشرف على وضعها قسم التخطيط في الأمانة بالتعاون مع بعض الخبراء بالأمم المتحدة.\n\nإلا أن الزيادة غير المتوقعة في عدد السكان بالمدينة نتيجة الحروب المتلاحقة في المنطقة، أدى إلى عدم تبني المخطط الشمولي القديم، وإن كان هناك عدة محاولات أخرى، إلا أنها كانت تصطدم أيضا بنفس المشكلة. أما مؤخرا، فقد شهدت أمانة عمان الكبرى تطورا كبيرا، حيث توسعت عمان بشكل مدروس لم تشهده المدينة من قبل. ونالت خطة مدينة عمان الشمولية جوائز عالمية منها جائزة القيادة العالمية في تخطيط المدن وجائزة المدينة عن قارة آسيا لعام 2007.\nإن من أهم المشكلات الاجتماعية الحضرية في عمّان حاليا، هي الطفرة الكبيرة في النمو السكاني والحضري. ومع زيادة عدد السكان، واجهت المدينة عدة مشاكل منها: ظهور مناطق عشوائية، نقص المساكن، عدم كفاية المياه، مشكلة المرور داخل المدينة.\n\nتبلغ مساحة الأراضي المبنية في عمّان 640 كم² بنسبة 38% من إجمالي مساحة مناطق الأمانة البالغة 1668 كم²، ووالأراضي غير المبنية 1027 كم² بنسبة 62%. كما تبين أن مساحات الأراضي التجارية 20 كم² بنسبة 5%، والأراضي الصناعية 65 كم² بنسبة 15%، والمرافق العامة (مؤسسات حكومية، مدارس، الحدائق العامة...) 20 كم² بنسبة 5%، والأراضي الزراعية 21 كم² بنسبة 5%.\nبالإضافة إلى شوارع عمّان التي تشكل مساحتها 191 كم² بنسبة 11% من مساحة مناطق الأمانة، تعتبر الأدراج من سمات مدينة عمان العريقة، حيث تنتشر على سفوح جبالها لتصل البيوت ببعضها البعض حين تعجز الشوارع عن أداء تلك المهمة، إذ يخيل لزائر عمان إنها مدينة تقف على قدميها باستمرار، وقد اتخذت بعض بيوتها مواقع لها، ولم يكن ممكنا وصلها مع باقي أجزاء المدينة إلا بواسطة الدرج. وبهذا تعتبر هذه الأدراج القديمة بحدّ ذاتها معلما تاريخيا. ومن هذه الأدراج: الكلحة، اللويبدة، رغدان وبسمان. ولقد تم مؤخرًا تحديد مناطق الأبراج بأربع مناطق فقط هي: المركز التجاري الجديد لمنطقة العبدلي، مركز تقاطعات الطرق الرئيسة (على امتداد ممر وادي عبدون)، بوابة عمان الشمالية (وتقع في الجبيهة بمحاذاة شارع الأردن)، بوابة عمان الجنوبية (هي المنطقة المتاخمة من الناحية الشرقية لطريق المطار ومحاط بالطريق الدائري لوادي عبدون).\n\nالنسيج الحضري\nتشغل المناطق السكنية الجانب الأكبر من مساحة عمّان، وتتوزع قطاعات السكن أ، ب، ج على الأحياء الراقية من العاصمة، وهي الواقعة في الجزء الغربي (عمان الغربية) كالشميساني والمدينة الرياضية وجبل عمّان وعبدون ودير غبار، وينتشر قطاعا السكن ج، د في المناطق الشرقية (عمان الشرقية) والجنوبية الغربية كجبل القصور والهاشمي والقلعة والجوفة وماركا والأشرفية ونزال. حيث تحدد الأمانة القطاع وفقا لعدة عوامل عمرانية وتخطيطية.\nلقد تم تصنيف عمّان عام 2010، ضمن 14 مدينة عربية كمدينة عالمية (أو Global City)، وفقا لمجموعة دراسات العولمة والمدن العالمية GaWC، التي تتخذ من بريطانيا مقرا لها. حيث يأخذ التصنيف بعين الاعتبار: الخصائص الاقتصادية (كمؤشرات سوق الأسهم / القيمة السوقية، توفر الخدمات المالية، إجمالي الناتج المحلي)، والخصائص السياسية (كحجم المدينة من حيث عدد السكان أو حجم التجمعات الحضرية، معايير جودة المعيشة ومدى تطور المدينة، المشاركة والتأثير في مناسبات دولية)، والخصائص الثقافية (كمدى شهرة المدينة عالميا، تواجد المؤسسات الثقافية، المرافق الرياضية، المؤسسات التعليمية والجامعات، مواقع التراث العالمي، والمزارات الدينية)، والبنية التحتية (كنظام النقل والمطارات، ووجود قاعدة اتصالات حديثة مثل الألياف البصرية وخدمات الهاتف المحمول، والخدمات الصحية كالمستشفيات). ويتم اختيار المدن وفقا لتطبيقها لهذه المعايير، أو افتقادها لبعضها. حيث احتلت بموجبه عمّان مركزًا ضمن فئة +Gamma، من بين التصنيفات المتعددة للمدن في العالم.\n\nالهوية المعمارية\nيتميز البناء في عمّان عمومًا باستخدام الحجر كجزء أساسي يدعم واجهات البناء من جهاته الأربعة. وهذا لا ينحصر في جزء مُعيّن بالمدينة، ولكن تتميز عمان الغربية بجمال العمارة وجودة الخدمات وانتشار الفنادق من فئة الخمسة نجوم ومعظم الوزارات المنشأة على أسس ومقاييس متميزة في العمارة والبناء. أضفت الحجارة المستخدمة في بناء مدينة عمان فناً تميزت به هذه المدينة وأضفت على طابعها المعماري لمسة جمالية دفعت المهندسين إلى ممارسة إبداعهم في تنوع كبير من أساليب العمارة باستخدام الحجر.\nبحسب مجموعة من المهندسين المعماريين حملوا على أنفسهم أن ينتجوا نماذج من فن العمارة في عمّان، أكدوا تأثر العمارة في الأردن بالموروث الحضاري لمدينة عمّان المعماري الإسلامي والروماني واليوناني. إلا أن معظمهم أكد أن الفن الإسلامي هو غاية وأمنية بالنسبة لهم. ويعيب المهندسون على بعض الأبنية والتي يسمونها أبنية التجميع والتي يحمل التصميم فيها سمات عمارة الغرب المتزاوجة مع تصميمات المنطقة بدون الأخذ بعين الاعتبار الطابع المعماري الذي يميّز المنطقة وتاريخها والاعتبارات الثقافية والحضارية الأخرى. وبعضهم يصمم مبنى تحمل واجهاته أكثر من ثقافة وتراث أطلق عليه المهندسون «أسلوب الإبهار» والخالي من المضمون والموروث والفاشل هندسيا وذكروا عددا من تلك النماذج في أماكن متعددة في عمان. لم ينكر المهندسون الحاجة أحيانا إلى إدخال بعض المواد العصرية للبناء مثل الزجاج والصفائح المعدنية ضمن تصميم مدروس يراعي تطوير العمارة العربية مبينين أن هذا التداخل مطلوب ولا غبار عليه.\n\nإن أساليب العمارة في عمان عديدة ولا يمكن حصرها. وقد تتعدد بتعدد الثقافات المعمارية التي حملها خريجو الهندسة الأردنيون من الشرق والغرب وعادوا بعد تخرجهم ليزرعوا ثمارها في جنبات المدينة وما حملوه من مذاهب معمارية متعددة. ويبدو أنه كان لتنتشر نتيجة لذلك التشكيل المتعدد فوضى معمارية هائلة لولا الاستعمال الموّحد للحجر الأردني في جميع هذه المباني. أدى هذا إلى استعمال واسع لحجر البناء الذي توفر بصورة لبّت الحاجة لطبيعة عمّان الجغرافية والطبوغرافية كمدينة أحيطت بعدة جبال شكلت محاجرها رافدًا أساسيًا لتزويد المدينة بالحجارة. ولكن اتساع المدينة المطرد مع الزمن دفعها للبحث عن مصدر للحجارة من أماكن أخرى في المملكة ومن محافظات جنوب الأردن وخصوصا من محافظة معان.\n\nوسط المدينة الجديد\nتم البدء بمشروع العبدلي أو مشروع تطوير منطقة العبدلي في عام 2005 وكان متوقعًا الانتهاء منه عام 2010. وسيصبح قلب عمّان الجديد ومركزها. يقوم المشروع على أرض مساحتها 804 كيلومترات مربعة، من مساحة مبنية تزيد على 1,7 مليون أمتار مربعة تضمّ مجمّعات سكنية ومكاتب وفنادق وشقق مخدومة ومحلات تجارية ومراكز للترفيه؛ وهو بذلك سيصبح محور الأعمال والسكن في العاصمة الأردنية عمّان.\nلقد تم تطوير العبدلي ليكون مثابة مركز ذكي للمدينة حيث يجمع سوية البنية التحتية لوسائط الإعلام والاتصال، بما يكفل إيصال أكثر التقنيات تطورًا إلى كل منزل ومكتب ومتجر، بينما تتوفر فيه حلول طاقة عامة وأنظمة غاز مركزية بما يضمن بيئة سليمة وودية فضلاً عن التوفير الكبير في فاتورة الطاقة. وسيكون مركز المدينة مجهزًا كليًا بأنظمة متطورة تقنيًا لإدارة المباني وللحماية من الحرائق ولإدارة السلامة والتدابير الاحتياطية. ساهم مشروع تطوير العبدلي في إيجاد شبكات طرق وحلول مرورية ممتازة حول المشروع وداخله، بما يؤمّن الانسيابية لنحو 90,000 شخص يوميًا من السكان والعاملين والزوار عندما يعمل المشروع بكامل طاقته.\n\nدور العبادة\nيُشكل المسلمون غالبية سكان عمان حيث يشكلون ما نسبته 94%، ويشكل المسيحيون النسبة الباقية أي ما نسبته 6% من السكان من مختلف الطوائف، ويكفل الدستور للجميع حرية ممارسة الأديان، ولذلك تجد في عمان مجموعة متنوعة من المساجد والكنائس موزعة في مختلف أنحاء العاصمة اعتني في تصميمها وبناؤها لتتميز وتكمل نسيج المدينة المعماري. لقد تزايد عدد المساجد في الأردن بشكل لافت وملحوظ في الآونة الأخيرة وبارقام قياسية شهدت ارتفاعا كبيرا فاقت دول عربية وإسلامية مجاورة. وبلغ عدد المساجد العاملة في المملكة 6243 مسجدا - بلغت حصة عمّان منها 25%.\n\nيُلاحظ بشكل واضح أن تصميم معظم مساجد المدينة قد تم على الطرازين الأموي والفاطمي، نتيجة للطبيعة الجغرافية التي حتّمت أن تكون عمّان جزءا من محيطها المعماري والحضاري الممتد من سوريا وفلسطين ولبنان حتى مصر.\nيُشار بالذكر إلى أن المهاجرين المسلمين الشركس والشيشان قد ساهموا في بناء أول مساجد المدينة في العصر الحديث منذ نهاية القرن التاسع عشر. وتشهد المساجد الأثرية في مناطق تواجدهم - خاصة في وادي السير وراس العين ووسط البلد على هذا الأمر.\nيُعد كل من مسجد أبو درويش، مسجد الملك عبد الله الأول، المسجد الحسيني، مسجد الملك الحسين، مسجد الشريعة، مسجد أبو قورة، مسجد الكالوتي، مسجد الروضة، ومسجد سيدو الكردي من أكبر مساجد المدينة وأشهرها. أما بالنسبة للكنائس، فتوجد في عمّان العشرات منها والتي تخدم جميع الطوائف المسيحية، ومن أهمها: كنيسة دخول السيد إلى الهيكل في الصويفية، كنيسة مطرانية الروم الكاثوليك، كنيسة قصر البشارات، كنيسة الأقباط، كنيسة البشارة في اللويبدة، كنيسة الاتحاد المسيحي الإنجيلية في جبل عمّان، كنيسة الراعي الصالح الإنجيلية اللوثرية في أم السماق، والكنائس المعمدانية في الرابية وأبو نصير والشميساني وخلدا وصويلح وغيرها.\n\nالثقافة والفنون\nبدأت البوادر الجادة لظهور حركة تشكيلية في عمّان في أوائل الخمسينات من القرن الفائت، ففي عام 1951 أقام «المنتدى العربي» أول معرض جماعي في الأردن. وبعده بسنة، تأسس معهد الموسيقى والرسم في المدينة. وفي أواخر الخمسينيات، أرسلت الحكومة أول مبعوثين أردنيين لدراسة الفن في الخارج، وهم: رفيق اللحام، ومهنا الدرة، وأحمد نعواش، وكمال بلاطة، والتحق بعضهم بأكاديمية الفنون الجميلة في روما. وفي عقد الستينيات بدأ الموفدون بالعودة إلى عمّان، وممارسة فنهم، وتدريس مادة الرسم في المدارس الثانوية، ومع عودتهم ازداد النشاط الفني، وكذلك أخذ عدد المعارض التي كانت تقام في القدس وعمان يتضاعف، والمحاضرات الفنية كذلك، كما أخذت وزارة السياحة مبادرة المشاركة بأعمال الفنانين الأردنيين في المعارض الدولية.\n\nفي عام 1966 تأسست دائرة الثقافة والفنون، التابعة لوزارة الإعلام، وهدفها دعم الفنون التشكيلية والمسرحية والموسيقى والأدب وتشجيعها. ومع بداية السبعينيات تضاعف النشاط الفني في المدينة، ففي عام 1972 أسست دائرة الثقافة والفنون «معهد الفنون والموسيقى»، وقد أُريد له أن يكون نواة لأكاديمية فنية، ومدة الدراسة في المعهد سنتان، تعطى فيها دروس في الفن والتصوير والنحت وفن الطباعة والخزف، وقد تخرج منه عدد من الفنانين الأردنيين استطاع بعضهم إكمال دراسته الفنية العليا في الخارج، معتمدين على التأسيس الذي حصلوا عليه في المعهد.\nلا شك أن الحركة التشكيلية الأردنية تعتبر من أنشط الحركات الفنية في عمّان قياسا إلى الحركة المسرحية، أو الموسيقية مثلا، فقد شهدت فترة التسعينيات من القرن الماضي والسنوات الماضية من الألفية الجديدة، نشاطا تشكيليا ملفتا للنظر، وقد تجلى هذا النشاط بغزارة إقامة المعارض الفنية للفنانين الأردنيين والفنانين العرب والعالميين، وكان واضحا أن هناك ما يشبه الهجرة للفنانين العراقيين بوجه خاص إلى الأردن منذ بداية التسعينيات أما للإقامة الدائمة، أو المؤقتة في طريقهم للخارج، وهذا انعكس حراكا فنيا واضحا على الساحة الأردنية، وتواصلا بين الفنانين الأردنيين والعراقيين، وجد تعبيراته في ازدياد عدد المعارض الفنية، وإنشاء قاعات العرض الخاصة التي تزايدت أعدادها بشكل كبير، والتي تستقطب تجارب الفنانين الأردنيين والعرب والعالميين مما يشير إلى تنامي الوعي الفني وانتشاره بين الجمهور، كما يؤشر إلى ازدياد أعداد الفنانين الأردنيين، وإقبال العديد من الطلبة على دراسة الفن التشكيلي، مما دفع إلى فتح كلية للفنون الجميلة في الجامعة الأردنية في عمان في عام 2003 تدرس من ضمن تخصصاتها الرسم، الجرافيك والتصميم وغيرها من مفردات الفن التشكيلي وتخصصاته المختلفة إلى جانب المسرح والموسيقى.\nأما بالنسبة للموسيقى، فكانت حاضرة منذ أوائل القرن العشرين، خاصة أن هناك تداخل ما بين الثقافة البدوية والحضرية في المدينة. أما بالنسبة للموسيقى الكلاسيكية، فهناك أوركسترا وطنية تتخذ من عمان مقرا لها وهي أوركسترا عمان السيمفوني، التي ولدت من رحم أوركسترا المعهد الوطني للموسيقى (مؤسسة الملك الحسين) وبدعم من أمانة عمان الكبرى. قدمت الأوركسترا باكورة حفلاتها في شهر كانون الثاني / يناير 2007. ويزخر الموسم الثقافي السنوي لأوركسترا عمان السمفوني ببرنامج منوع من الحفلات العامة، تقدم في ثالث أربعاء من كل شهر.\n\nعاصمة الثقافة العربية والإسلامية\nتشهد عمّان ازديادًا بالأنشطة والمهرجانات المحلية والعربية، وذلك منذ إعلانها عاصمة للثقافة العربية عام 2002، يبرز من بينها إطلاق مشروع مسرح التراث الموسيقي الأردني، وافتتاح مشغل النحت العربي، ومهرجان عمان للأفلام الوثائقية، والمعرض الشامل للفن التشكيلي العربي، بالإضافة لافتتاح شارع الثقافة،\nمن جهة أخرى، فقد تم إعلان مدينة عمّان عام 2017 عاصمةً للثقافة الإسلامية عن المنطقة العربية.\nتنتشر في عمّان عدد كبير من المعارض ومراكز الفنون الجميلة وعدّة أسواق شعبية تعرض إسهامات الفنانين في وسط البلد وجبل عمان وجبل اللويبدة، حيث شهدت هذه الأماكن حراكا ثقافيا نوعيّا في العقدين الأخيرين، زمن أشهر تلك المراكز؛ دارة الفنون، دار الأندى، محترف رمال للفنون وكثير من المعارض الأخرى. ويجدر بالذكر إلى أن وزارة الثقافة في الأردن قد تبنت مؤخرا تجربة المدن الثقافية، أو مايطلق عليه عاصمة الثقافة الأردنية - كما حدث في إربد والسلط والكرك والزرقاء ومعان تباعا، مما أتاح قدر أكبر للانفتاح الثقافي والأدبي على المدن الأردنية الباقية وعدم حصرها بالعاصمة، والتي سبق لها ان نالت لقب عاصمة الثقافة العربية.\n\nوسط عمّان الثقافي\nتتضمن منطقة راس العين الكثير من المرافق الثقافية التي تكمل دور أمانة عمان الكبرى في إحياءها ابتداءً من مسجد النورين وساحة النوافير وساحة النخيل ومن ثم قاعة المدينة ومبنى موظفي أمانة عمان الكبرى وانتهاءً بمركز الحسين الثقافي، حيث تبلغ مساحة المشروع حوالي (20) دونماً من اصل مساحة الساحة البالغة (143) دونماً. وتتضمن هذه المساحة على مقر الأمانة، متحف الأردن، مسرح مركز الحسين الثقافي، المعهد الوطني للموسيقى، بالإضافة إلى سوق الحرف الشعبية. وكان مُقررًا أيضًا أن يُنفذ مشروع دار للأوبرا في هذه المنطقة، هي دارة الملك عبد الله الثاني للثقافة والفنون، إلا أنه توقف وتم تحويله إلى سوق شعبي في عام 2014.\nتحوي عمّان على عدد لا بأس به من المتاحف، مثل المتحف الوطني للفنون الجميلة، متحف الأزياء الشعبية، متحف صرح الشهيد، متحف الحياة البرلمانية، متحف الآثار الأردني، متحف الأطفال، متحف السيارات الملكي، القرية الثقافية في حدائق الحسين، بالإضافة إلى عدد كبير من المراكز الثقافية الأجنبية.\nيوجد في جبل عمان أيضًا، سوق مختص بالحرف اليدوية والثقافة الشعبية، يُدعى سوق جارا، وهو سوق موسمي يبدأ أسبوعيًا في كل يوم جمعة خلال شهر أيار/مايو، وينتهي في شهر تشرين الأول/أكتوبر. تُقيمه سنويا رابطة سكان جبل عمان. يرتاده السياح بكثرة خلال فصل الصيف.\nمن الجدير بالذكر إلى أن المدينة تستضيف كل عام مهرجانات ثقافية عالمية ومحلية؛ من أهمها معرض الكتاب العالمي، مهرجان أيام عمان المسرحية، مهرجان الأردن، مهرجان الموسيقى والغناء الصوفي، مهرجان صيف عمان، مهرجان عمان للرقص المعاصر ومهرجان عمان للكوميديا، وغيرها.\n\nالإعلام\nمعظم الصحف الأردنية الكبرى ومراكز البث موجودة في عمّان. كما تُشكل المدينة مركزا إعلاميًا للصحفيين الدوليين الآتين لتغطية أخبار المنطقة المتجددة سواء في فلسطين، العراق وسوريا، أو في مناطق قريبة أخرى.\nتأسست في عمّان عام 1969 وكالة الأنباء الأردنية، وهي وكالة الأنباء الرسمية في الأردن. كما تأسست المدينة الإعلامية الأردنية في عام 2001، وهي الأولى من نوعها في منطقة بلاد الشام، والتي يُؤمل منها أن تجعل من عمّان محورا رئيسيا لشبكات البث الفضائي. يوجد الآنالكثير من المحطات التي ترسل بثها منها. تحاول عمّان اليوم منافسة مدن أخرى ذات الخبرة والإمكانيات في مجال الإعلام مثل بيروت ودبي والقاهرة. وقد تأسس في 2003 الهيئة الملكية الأردنية للأفلام، وهي مؤسسة تقدم الدعم لإنتاج الأفلام والمسلسلات التلفزيونية في الأردن وتدريب الناشئة وصانعي الأفلام والمهنيين من الأردن والمنطقة في جميع مجالات السينما والإنتاج التلفزيوني. تقدم الهيئة برامج وورش تدريبية على مدار السنة، من أجل بناء صناعة أفلام حديثة ورائدة ذات مستوى عالمي في الأردن، بحيث يتمكن جميع صانعي الأفلام في الشرق الأوسط إنتاج أفلام بحرية جنباً إلى جنب أكثر فناني العالم موهبة.\n\nالاقتصاد\nكانت الليرة العثمانية هي العملة المتداولة في عمّان أثناء الحكم العثماني. استمر ذلك حتى أُنشئت إمارة شرق الأردن تحت وصاية الانتداب البريطاني، فتم استخدام الجنيه المصري بشكل مؤقت إلى أن أصدر الجنيه الفلسطيني عام 1927 حيث اعتمد في الدولة واستخدم حتى مطلع الخمسينيات من القرن الماضي، عندما صدر الدينار الأردني وصار هو العملة الرسمية. كما يُستخدم الدولار الأمريكي واليورو إلى جانب الدينار في عمليات البيع والشراء. ما زال سكان عمّان يستخدمون كلمة الليرة رغم تعاملهم بالدينار نتيجة للتأثر الطويل بالعثمانيين الذين حكموا بلاد الشام قرابة 4 قرون.\n\nتُعتبر عمّان اليوم مركزًا للحياة الاقتصادية في الأردن، الذي انتعش اقتصاده برجوع رؤوس الأموال والمستثمرين من الكويت والخليج سنة 1990 حيث بدأت خطط التنمية تلقى طريقها في المدينة من إنشاء مشاريع كثيرة. ويعتمد اقتصاد المدينة على قطاعات البناء والبنوك والتأمين والتجارة وبشكل كبير على قطاع السياحة والفندقة، بالإضافة للصناعات الغذائية والخفيفة والمتوسطة. تتخذ كبرى الشركات الأردنية وعدد من الشركات الإقليمية والعالمية في المنطقة من المدينة مقرا لها. كذلك يمتلك العديد من مواطني دول الخليج العربي وكبار أثرياء العرب عقارات وأعمال في عمّان الغربية. في العقدين الأخيرين قامت العديد من الشركات الخليجية والعربية والعالمية بالاستثمار في عمّان تتصدرها الشركات الكويتية.\nاحتلت عمّان في عام 2007 المرتبة الأولى بين المدن العربية من حيث غلاء المعيشة فيها - حسب «مجلة الإيكونومست البريطانية». حيث أن ارتفاع أسعار المساكن والعقارات والأراضي، إلى جانب ارتفاع أسعار النفط الذي أثر على كلف الإنتاج وزيادة قيمة المستوردات، عوامل ساهمت في تربع عمّان على صدارة قائمة أغلى المدن عربيا.\n\nبورصة عمان وغرفة تجارة عمّان\nتأسست بورصة عمان في عام 1999 كمؤسسة مستقلة تُدار من قبل القطاع الخاص لمزاولة العمل كسوق منظم لتداول الأوراق المالية في المملكة. تقوم البورصة بتوفير أنظمة إلكترونية ووسائل ربط وقاعات مجهزة بالأدوات والوسائل التقنية الحديثة. ومراقبة عمليات التداول في السوق والتنسيق مع الهيئة في متابعة تلك العمليات. كما قامت بوضع معايير للسلوك المهني لضمان التزام أعضائها بمبادئ التداول السليم، كما تحرص على ضرورة النشر الفوري والصحيح للمعلومات لجميع المهتمين بنفس الوقت. أما غرفة تجارة عمّان تتكون من 12 عضوا منتخبين عن طريق الاقتراع الحر والمباشر من قبل أعضاء الهيئة العامة للغرفة البالغ عددهم حوالي 35,000 عضو، ومدة عضوية المجلس 4 سنوات، وتهدف الغرفة إلى قيادة القطاع التجاري نحو مستقبل أفضل للأعمال واقتصاد وطني حر.\n\nالأسواق\nازدهرت حركة التجارة في عمان منذ القدم، ففيها عدة أسواق قديمة، وهي كالآتي: سوق السكر، وسوق البخارية، وسوق الجمعة، وسوق وادي السرور، وسوق الخضار، وسوق اليمنية، وسوق الحبوب، وسوق الحلال، وسوق الصاغة، وسوق السعادة، وسوق الأنتيكا، وسوق البناء الحديث. بالنسبة إلى سوق البخارية القديم، الذي نسج خيوط الحكاية لشيخ من بخاري قدم إلى عمان كغيره من التجار فأسس هذا السوق القديم في ساحة شرقي المسجد الحسيني الحالي عام 1934 وبقي السوق في موقعه إلى عام 1954 وبعدها نقل إلى عمارة فوزي المفتي في شارع الملك طلال مقابل المسجد الحسيني تتوزع عشرات المحلات التجارية حسب نوعية البضائع التي يبيعها السوق. ويمكن تصنيفها إلى محال لبيع أدوات ومستلزمات الحلاقين، وأدوات ومستلزمات الخياطة والتطريز، ومستلزمات مشاغل الخياطة والكلف، وهناك محال لبيع الإكسسوارات والمنسوجات والعطارة، ومحال لبيع العطور والبخورات.\nوعلى الرغم من هذا التنوع التجاري لواقع العاصمة عمان بين الأسواق القديمة والمولات الحديثة والتي تختلف في الشكل والمحتوى تبقى ظاهرة انتشار البسطات بمختلف أنواعها ومحتوياتها موجودة في شوارع الأسواق داخل عمان.\nومن أكبر مراكز التسوق الحديثة في المدينة، ستي مول، مكة مول، تاج مول، عمّان مول، غاليريا مول.\n\nالصناعة\nاتبعت أمانة عمان الكبرى بالتعاون مع وزارة الصناعة والتجارة المعايير في تحديد المناطق الصناعية. وعليه قامت أمانة عمان الكبرى بإجراء دراسة مكثفة وتحليل لخيارات المواقع الملائمة لتأهيلها لتكون المناطق الصناعية كالتالي:\n\nمنطقة سحاب – وممر الموقر: تمّ تصنيف هذه المنطقة كمنطقة صناعات خفيفة ومتوسطة مع الأخذ بعين الاعتبار الصناعات القائمة حاليا في هذه المنطقة وتوفير بعد جغرافي عن المناطق السكنية في منطقة الموقر والنقيرة.\nمنطقة القسطل الصناعية: مع الأخذ بعين الاعتبار الوضع الصناعي الحالي في منطقة القسطل يأتي تحديد هذه المنطقة جنوب شرق طريق المطار حيث تم تصنيف هذه المنطقة للصناعات المتخصصة كصناعات الأبحاث والأعمال والتقنيات. أما بقية الأراضي في هذه المنطقة فقد تم تصنيفها صناعات خفيفة ومتوسطة لتكون مساندة للصناعات المتخصصة في نفس المنطقة وأيضا تسمح هذه المنطقة بتوفير مناطق جغرافية واسعة للمد الصناعي.\nمنطقة الجيزة الصناعية: تمّ تحديد المنطقة جنوبي الجيزة كمنطقة صناعات متوسطة وخفيفة مع الأخذ بعين الاعتبار الصناعات القائمة حاليا في تلك المنطقة. حيث ستكون هذه المنطقة منطقة جذب للعمالة بسبب المشاريع السكنية التي ستقام بالقرب منها، كمشروع تعمير للإسكان.\nهذا وتوجد عدة مناطق صناعية، تحوي على عدد من الوكالات وكثير من محلات تصليح السيارات، متوزعة على أطراف العاصمة، كما في البيادر إلى الجنوب الغربي، وصافوط إلى الشمال الغربي، وماركا إلى الشمال الشرقي، ووادي الرمم إلى الشرق، والوحدات إلى الجنوب من المدينة.\n\nالزراعة\nاشتهرت مدينة عمان بانتمائها إلى منطقة خصبة وافرة الغلال، فقد وصفتها المصادر القديمة ومنها التوراة بكثرة المياه «مدينة المياه»، كما أن الجغرافيين والمؤرخين العرب نعتوا منطقة عمان بالخصب والنماء وكثرة الغلات. ومما اشتهرت به عمان: الحبوب الكثيرة خصوصاً القمح، فوصفت بأنها معدن الحبوب، حتى ضرب المثل بجودة حنطتها، وقد رأينا أنها والصلت كانت تزود القدس وبعض المدن الفلسطينية بالقمح بعدما حررها صلاح الدين من الصليبيين، فاشترط صلاح الدين على أخيه - التي كانت ضمن أقطاعه بأن يرسل القمح ففعل.\nواشتهرت عمان أيضا بالخراف الجيدة السمينة والعسل اللذيذ وانتشرت حولها كروم الأعناب العديد التي استخرجوا منها الخمور وعملوا منها الزبيب، وكذلك أشجار التين الكثيرة ومنها عملوا القطين، التين المجفف، كما اشتهرت بالفواكه الكثيرة وأشجار البطم وغيره.\nوقد وصفت منطقة البلقاء في العصور الوسطى بأنها ذات قرى ومزارع وارضها زكية طيبة حتى إن قراها بلغت نيفاً وثلاثمائة قرية، أما مزارعها فهي واسعة منتشرة نذكر منها مزرعة لأبي سفيان زعيم قريش، وأخرى ليوسف بن عمرو والي العراق. كذلك اشتهرت جادية إحدى قرى البلقاء بزراعة الزعفران - الورس- وكانت له أهميته إذ ذاك لاستعماله في الصباغة وصدر للخارج لان الأوروبيين كانوا يستعملونه كدواء أيضاً. كما صدرت عمان نبات الرواند، وهو عبارة عن عروق خشبية مستديرة في غلظ الأصابع وسمي الروابد الشامي أو رواند الدواب لان البياطرة يسقونه للدواب إذا احترت اكبادها. وهو غير الرواند الصيني الذي يشبه القلقاس ويستعمل في علاج الإنسان، كاوجاع الكبد والكلى والمغص.\nأما نهرها الصغير الذي ذكره الجغرافيون، فقد اقيمت عليه في العصور المختلفة الحمامات لخدمة سكانها، وفي خارجها أقيمت عليه الارحية لطحن الدقيق وكانت هذه الرحية تخدم سكان القرى المجاورة فيقصدون عمان من اجل طحن دقيقهم هذا بالإضافة إلى الزراعات والخضر المختلفة التي تقوم على ضفافه لخدمة سكان المدينة العريقة.\n\nالسياحة\nتشهد عمّان في فصل الصيف ازديادًا كبيرًا في عدد السيّاح، وخصوصًا من الدول العربية. حيث يساعد المناخ المتوسطي المعتدل في جذب هذه الفئة، بالإضافة إلى إقامة العديد من المهرجانات الثقافية والنشاطات الفنية المختلفة. ويوجد عدد لابأس به من الأماكن لزيارتها في المدينة كالمناطق السياحية والمصايف وأماكن الترفيه، بالإضافة إلى المواقع التاريخية الهامة التي تحكي قصة المدينة، وأهمها المدرج الروماني وقلعة عمّان ورجم الملفوف العمّوني. كما تحوي المدينة الكثير من المطاعم والمقاهي التي تقدم الأطعمة الشرقية والغربية خاصة تلك التي تقع في أطراف العاصمة وخارجها وسط الغابات والأشجار الحرجية كجبال عجلون ودبين ومرتفعات الرمان وتحتوي معظم هذه المطاعم والمتنزهات على ملاعب للأطفال أو برك للسباحة مما يجعلها متعة حقيقية لجميع أفراد الأسرة. وتنتشر في عمان والمدن الأردنية الأخرى أسواق الحرف والصناعة التقليدية من المنسوجات والمطرزات والأزياء والحلي والمجوهرات والخزفيات والزجاج كما تتوفر مراكز التسوق الكبيرة التي تحتوي على المحلات التجارية المتعددة وتعرض الملابس الحديثة لدور الأزياء العالمية.\n\nيقع في عمّان الكثير من النوادي الرياضية المتخصصة كنوادي ركوب الخيل والسباحة والنوادي الصحية التي يستطيع الزائر قضاء وقت مفيد وممتع فيها كما تقام أثناء فصل الصيف نواد صيفية متعددة الغايات المغامرات والغطس والسباحة والكمبيوتر يشارك فيها الأطفال والشباب العرب الزوار إلى جانب الأردنيين لممارسة رياضاتهم المختلفة. كما تنتشر المدن الترويحية والمتنزهات والحدائق العامة وصالات ألعاب تسلية الأطفال.\nمن أهم المناطق التي يرتادها السياح، مناطق شارع الثقافة وعبدون وشارع الوكالات وسوق الصويفية وسوق الرابية وشارع مكة وشارع المدينة المنورة وشارع الجامعة الأردنية وسوق جبل اللويبدة وشارع الرينبو وسوق جبل الحسين وسوق أم أذينة، ومناطق وسط البلد بطبيعة الحال. وتحوي هذه المناطق على جملة من المطاعم والمقاهي المتنوعة ذات الطابع الشرقي والغربي، فبالإضافة للمطاعم الأردنية، يمكن للسائح أن يرى العديد من المطاعم اللبنانية والإيطالية والفرنسية والتركية والصينية والهندية ومطاعم الوجبات السريعة الأمريكية ومطاعم عراقية ويمنية وخليجية أخرى.\nشهدت عمّان في 9 تشرين الثاني/ نوفمبر 2005 فيما يعرف شعبيًا بيوم «الأربعاء الأسود» الذي مثّل ضربة عنيفة للسياحة في المدينة والبلاد بشكل عام، حيث أدت عدة عمليات انتحارية إرهابية إلى تفجير بتفجير ثلاثة من فنادقها، قُتل فيها ثلاثة من المهاجمين وألقي القبض على الرابع وهي سيدة. أودت الانفجارات بحياة 65 من المدنيين، ومنهم المخرج السوري مصطفى العقاد وابنته، وإصابة الكثيرين بجروج، مما أثر إلى حد كبير على سكانها ووفود السياح إليها ولكنها بتشديد الأمن واتخاذ الإجراءات المناسبة سرعان ما استعادت وضعها السابق حيث أخذت تستقبل الزائرين طوال العام وخاصة في فصل الصيف عند عودة المغتربين وزيارة السائحين والمصطافين وزيادة الفعاليات الترفيهية والثقافية كمهرجان جرش سابقا ومهرجان الأردن حاليا ومهرجان صيف عمان.\n\nالفنادق\nيوجد في عمّان ما لا يقل عن 36 فندق من فئة الأربعة والخمسة نجوم معظمها أنشئ في عمان الغربية، والعديد منها يتبع سلسلة فنادق عالمية مثل فندق إنتركونتيننتال الأردن والفور سيزنز والميريديان والغراند حياة والراديسون ساس والشيراتون. ويتميز فندق الرويال في عمّان بعمارته الفريدة، إذ يظهر في أفق المدينة وكأنه قلعة تعلو جبل عمان.\n\nالمعالم الأثرية\nوتتمتع عمّان بثروة من المعالم الأثرية الشهيرة ما زالت شاهدة على حضارات قديمة استوطنت المدينة، فعلى جبل القلعة الذي يعلو المدينة القديمة يرتفع «هيكل هرقل» الذي بناه الرومان في القرن الثاني الميلادي على بقايا معبد عموني قديم، إلى جانب متحف الآثار الذي يحتوي على معروضات عديدة من مختلف الحضارات وأدوات تمثل حياة الإنسان في هذه العهود القديمة. وفي وسط المدينة يقع سبيل الحوريات، وعلى مقربة من السبيل ينتصب المدرج الروماني الكبير الذي يتسع لخمسة آلاف متفرج، وغيرها من المعالم التي تُستغل حتى اليوم في فعاليات ثقافية وفنية عديدة، وهي من المراكز التي يستغلها مهرجان الأردن وينظم فيها فعالياته:\n\nمنتزهات وأماكن ترفيهية ورياضية\nرُوعي في التخطيط المدني للمدينة تنوّع الأماكن الترفيهية في نوعيتها وأماكن وجودها، وهناك محاولات حثيثة لزيادتها. ومعظم الجديد منها ينشأ على أطراف المدينة على جانبي الطريق الدائري لتسهيل الوصول إليها.\n\nالسياحة الطبية\nتصل عوائد السياحة الطبية إلى 700 مليون دولار أمريكي في العام، حسب تصريحات البنك الدولي فالأردن هي الأولى في المنطقة والخامسة على مستوى العالم في هذا المجال. هناك عدد من المستشفيات الحكومية والخاصة في عمّان، التي يرتادها المرضى العرب من دول الخليج العربي والعراق واليمن ودول المغرب العربي. وأن ما يجذب المرضى هو إجراءات تخفيض الأسعار والجودة العالية عن العلاج في أوروبا والولايات المتحدة الأمريكية. والساحة الطبية في عمّان تتميز بمهارة وخبرة متميزة في مجال أمراض وجراحة القلب وكذلك تطبيق الكثير من الجراحات الدقيقة فيما يخص العيون والكلى والرئتين.\n\nالصحة\nالمستشفيات\nشهدت عمّان مع تأسيس إمارة شرق الأردن في بداية العشرينات من القرن العشرين، نهضة طبية تمثلت بتأسيس عدد من المستشفيات الحكومية، التي كان أولها مستشفى البلدية ثم المستشفى الحكومي عام 1926. ثم تلى تلك الفترة تأسيس المستشفيات الخاصة، كان أولها مستشفى ملحس في جبل عمّان، وتحديًدا عام 1944. وظلت عمّان تطور من بنيتها التحتية الطبية خلال العقود اللاحقة، حيث تم تشييد مدينة الحسين الطبية عام 1973، والتي تُعد أول مدينة طبية عربية.\nكما شهدت الخدمات الصحية في فترة التسعينات، توسعًا كميًا ونوعيًا على كافة الأصعدة والقطاعات الطبية العاملة في هذا المجال الحكومي منه والقطاع الخاص. فقد شهد القطاع الخاص بعد عام 1990 نموًا مضطردًا في عدد المستشفيات كان أهمها المستشفى التخصصي ومستشفى الأردن ومستشفى الاستقلال ومستشفى الإسراء ومستشفى الأمير حمزة، وغيرها الكثير من المستشفيات التي حصلت على الاعتمادية الدولية من منظمة الصحة العالمية.\nغير أن أهم تلك الإنجازات تمثل بتشييد مركز عالمي متخصص بمعالجة مرض السرطان، هو مركز الحسين للسرطان، الذي تم تأسيسه عام 1997، ليكون أول مركز متخصص في علاج السرطان يحصل على الاعتماد الخاص بأمراض السرطان خارج الولايات المتحدة الاميركية.\n\nالجدول التالي يظهر أهم المستشفيات الموجودة في عمّان:\n\nالتعليم والتعليم العالي\nتعود بدايات التعليم في مدينة عمّان إلى فترة الحرب العالمية الأولى، وتحديدا عام 1916، عند افتتاح مدرسة دار النجاح، والتي كان موقعها خلف المسجد الحسيني الكبير، كان التعليم في المدرسة باللغة التركية ما عدا درس الدين الذي كان يدرس باللغة العربية، وكان يطلق على المدرسة اسم آخر أكثر استعمالا وشيوعا وهو «المكتب الحربي» لأن الخريجين كانوا يتأهلون للالتحاق بالكلية الحربية في الآستانية - إسطنبول.\nشهدت المدينة خلال حقبة الخمسينات والستينات من القرن الفائت طفرة نوعية في مجال التعليم ومن ثم التعليم العالي، بتأسيس الجامعة الأردنية. كما أن هذه الطفرة قد زادت بشكل ملحوظ في عقدي الثمانينات والتسعينات، وقد شهد قطاع التعليم الخاص ازدهارا ملحوظا حيث كانت عمّان هي السباقة فيه في منطقة الشرق الأوسط.\n\nكليات ومدارس\nفي يوليو / تموز 2003، أطلقت الحكومة الأردنية برنامجا طموحا في منطقة الشرق الأوسط وشمال أفريقيا كلها، وهو برنامج إصلاح التعليم من أجل الاقتصاد القائم على المعرفة وهو برنامج متعدد المانحين مدته عشر سنوات، وقدم البنك الدولي لهذا البرنامج 120 مليون دولار أمريكي. وسعى البرنامج إلى إعادة توجيه السياسات والبرامج التعليمية بما يتماشى مع حاجات اقتصاد قائم على المعرفة، وتحسين بيئة التعليم المادية في معظم المدارس، وتشجيع التعليم في سنوات الطفولة المبكرة. وامتدت المرحلة الأولى للبرنامج من 2003 إلى 2009 واختتمت في يونيو/حزيران 2009.\nوالمدارس في عمّان إما عامة أو خاصة. ويخدم قطاع التعليم الخاص أكثر من 31.14 في المائة من الطلبة في عمان. ولا يزال هذا القطاع يتحمل ضرائب باهظة تصل إلى 25 في المائة، مع أنه يتحمل عبئا كبيرا عن كاهل حكومة المملكة، الأمر الذي يجعل الرسوم الدراسية مرتفعة نسبيا، إذ تبدأ من 1000 دولار وتصل إلى 7000 دولار، وتعتبر قيمة رسوم التعليم الخاص مرتفعة للغاية عند مقارنتها بدخل الأسر في المتوسط.\nمن أشهر مدارس المدينة؛ الكلية العلمية الإسلامية، مدارس المطران، مدرسة الفرير، مدرسة راهبات الوردية، كلية الحسين، مدرسة راهبات الناصرة، المدارس العمرية، مدرسة اليوبيل، مدرسة البطريركية اللاتينية وغيرها الكثير.\nيشار بالذكر إلى أنه مبادرة التعليم في الأردن قد حصلت في الآونة الأخيرة على جائزة اليونسكو لاستخدام تكنولوجيا المعلومات والاتصالات في التعليم. ويستند هذا المشروع التعليمي الرائد في مدارس الأردن على الاستفادة من قوة المعلومات والتكنولوجيا من خلال طرق تدريس مجربة لتغيير بيئة التعلم في المدارس.\nبالإضافة إلى ذلك توجد العديد من الكليّات الخاصة والمعاهد التي تمنح شهادات الدبلوم في معظم التخصصات:\nمثل كلية القدس، الأكاديمية العربية للعلوم المالية والمصرفية، كلية طلال أبوغزاله لإدارة الأعمال، الكلية الجامعية المتوسطة والأكاديمية الملكية للطيران وكليات أخرى.\n\nجامعات\nبالنسبة للتعليم العالي، أو الجامعي، فتشمل عمّان عدد كبير من الجامعات قياسا لعدد السكان بالمدينة سواء على المستوى الخاص أو الحكومي، مثل الجامعة الأردنية، جامعة العلوم التطبيقية، جامعة البتراء، الجامعة الألمانية الأردنية، جامعة الأميرة سمية للتكنولوجيا، جامعة الزيتونة، جامعة الإسراء، جامعة العلوم الإسلامية العالمية، جامعة الشرق الأوسط، بعض كليات جامعة البلقاء التطبيقية، وجامعات أخرى.\nيُقبل الحائزين على شهادة الثانوية العامة في الجامعات الحكومية أو الخاصة أو الكليّات. تطبق معظم الجامعات في عمّان والأردن بشكل عام النموذج الأمريكي الجامعي القائم على نظام الساعات (بالإنجليزية: Credit Hours) الذي يمنح الطلبة المرونة لاختيار عدد الساعات وأوقات الدوام الصباحي أو المسائي. هنالك جامعتان حكوميتان مرتبطة بجامعات في الولايات المتحدة والمملكة المتحدة. هنالك أيضا أكثر من 5 جامعات خاصة مُعترف بها على مستوى الدول العربية، وبعض الجامعات الأجنبية كجامعة نيويورك والجامعة الألمانية الأردنية. تستقطب الجامعات الأردنية في عمّان وغيرها من المدن الأردنية كل عام عدد كبير من الطلبة الاجانب العرب وغير العرب.\n\nالبحث العلمي\nلدى الأردن أكبر عدد من الباحثين في مجال البحوث والتطوير لكل مليون شخص بين كل البلدان السبعة والخمسين الأعضاء في منظمة التعاون الإسلامي (OIC) وهو من أعلى المعدلات في العالم حيث يوجد في الأردن 8060 باحث لكل مليون شخص، بينما المتوسط العالمي يبلغ 2532، والمتوسط في الاتحاد الأوروبي يبلغ 6494، في حين أن المتوسط في البلدان الأعضاء في منظمة التعاون الإسلامي يبلغ 649 باحث لكل مليون شخص.\nوتحوي عمّان على كثير من المراكز العريقة في مجال البحث العلمي بجميع فروعه، ومن أهم تلك المراكز؛ الجمعية العلمية الملكية (المؤسسة عام 1970)، التي تهدف إلى تطوير التعاون العلمي والتكنولوجي مع مؤسسات مماثلة في جميع أنحاء العالم.\nكذلك بالنسبة للمركز الجغرافي الملكي الأردني، حيث يعتبر هذا المركز (المؤسس عام 1975) من المراكز المتقدمة على الصعيدين الإقليمي والدولي في مجال العلوم المساحية وإنتاج الخرائط والدراسات والأبحاث التطبيقية المستندة إلى معطيات الصور الفضائية والجوية. عمل المركز منذ إنشائه على توفير الكفاءات المدربة في مجال المساحة والخرائط وما يتعلق بهما من علوم كالاستشعار عن بعد والخرائط الرقمية والجيوديزيا الفضائية، وتم ذلك من خلال التأهيل خارج المملكة في الدول المتقدمة، وداخل المملكة في كلية المركز الجغرافي الملكي الأردني للعلوم المساحية، والتي لم يقتصر التدريب فيها على الأردنيين، بل شمل العديد من أبناء الدول العربية الأخرى.\nكما أن هناك كثير من الجمعيات والمراكز الأخرى المهتمة بمجالات مختلفة، منها الطب والطاقة والهندسة والفنون وغيرها.\n\nالرياضة\nتعد عمّان من أكثر المدن العربية في آسيا اهتماما بالشباب والرياضة بشكل عام، ويتجلى ذلك في عدد المجمعات والمدن الرياضية المخصصة للشباب، مما أثر إيجابا على مشاركات الأردن في بطولات عربية وإقليمية ودولية كثيرة وخاصة على مستوى كرة القدم وكرة السلة، اللتان تلقيا إقبالا واهتماما كبيرا من قبل الشباب الأردني. كذلك ألعاب الدفاع عن النفس والسباحة وكرة التنس واليد والفروسية كلها ألعاب يقبل عليها الشباب في هذه المدينة بشغف. كما ساهم المجلس الأعلى للشباب بتنمية قدرات الشباب من جميع النواحي الحياتيه عن طريق نشر مراكز الشباب في مختلف محافظات المملكة.\nمن أكثر الأندية شعبية بين الجمهور العمّاني على مستوى كرة القدم، هي أندية الوحدات (يتخد من ستاد القويسمة الدولي في الوحدات مقرا له) والفيصلي (يتخد من ستاد عمان الدولي مقرا له) بالإضافة إلى أندية أخرى مثل نادي البقعة. كما يلقى نادي زين والنادي الأرثوذكسي ونادي التطبيقية ونادي الأرينا... إلخ اهتماما كبير من قبل الجمهور ومشجعي كرة السلة الأردنية.\n\nالمدينة الرياضية\nكان هناك استشعار للقيادة الأردنية منذ منتصف الستينات في القرن الفائت، بحاجة الشباب الأردني لإنشاء مركز ريادي يخدم الشباب في كافة المجالات لإبراز قدراتهم وإبداعاتهم ومواكبة التقدم والتطور مما يعكس صورة مشرقة عن الأردن وشعبه، فتبلورت فكرة إنشاء مدينة للشباب التي أصبحت رائدة المدن الرياضية في الشرق الأوسط. تقع المدينة الرياضية أو مدينة الحسين للشباب في قلب العاصمة عمان، وتمتد على قطعة أرض تبلغ مساحتها حوالي 1200 دونم تغطي الأشجار ثلث مساحتها، بينما تحتل المنشآت الرياضية والملاعب والحدائق العامة والمواقف باقي مساحتها. تم البدء بإنشاء المدينة عام 1964 واستغرق ذلك حوالي أربع سنوات.\n\nمشاكل\nالغلاء\nتعاني مدينة عمّان من الارتفاع المستمر في الأسعار، إذ تصدرت أغلى مدن الشرق الأوسط وشمال أفريقيا من ناحية التكلفة المعيشية وفقًا لمجلة الإيكونومست البريطانية ـ في عاميّ 2007 و 2015. وأشار التقرير إلى أن العاصمة الأردنية تقدمت أربع مراتب في لائحة المدن الأغلى بالكلفة المعيشية لتحتل المرتبة الـ48 عالميًا للعام 2015، من المرتبة 52 للعام 2014، لتصبح بذلك ضمن قائمة أغلى خمسين مدينة على مستوى العالم، من بين 133 مدينة شملها التقرير.\n\nالعشوائيات\nأدّت الزيادة غير المتوقعة في عدد السكان في المدينة نتيجة الحروب المتلاحقة في المنطقة، إلى عدم تبنّي المخطط الشمولي الذي تم وضعه عام 1956، والذي يُعتبر أول مخطط هيكلي لعمّان بمعناه الصحيح، والذي حدد شكل المدينة ووظائفها والاستعمالات المختلفة وخطوط النقل والمواصلات وغيرها من الخصائص العامة. تعاني معظم أحياء مدينة عمّان اليوم من النمو العشوائي حتى في الأحياء الراقية، بالرغم من تصنيفها إلى مناطق أ، ب، ج،... إلخ بناءً على عوامل عمرانية وتنظيمية خاصة بقوانين أمانة عمان الكبرى. حيث أن تقسيمات الكثير من قطع الأراضي عشوائية ومتداخلة. كذلك ينتشر عدد ليس بقليل من الإسكانات بشكل غير مدروس، حيث أنها تتمدد باتجاهات غير منظمة مما يؤدي إلى عشوائية في الخدمات حيث يسكن السكان. بالإضافة إلى ضئالة المناطق الخضراء بالنسبة للمباني، وما تبقّى منها يتآكل بسرعة لتحل محله الإسكانات. أما الحدائق العامة فهي محدودة للغاية.\nعلى الرغم من ذلك، قد بدأت عمّان مؤخرًا بالتوسع بشكل مدروس لم تشهده المدينة من قبل، حيث نالت خطة مدينة عمان الشمولية جوائز عالمية، منها جائزة القيادة العالمية في تخطيط المدن وجائزة المدينة عن قارة آسيا لعام 2007.\n\nالأزمة المرورية\nأدت الظروف السياسية المتلاحقة بالمنطقة وتبعاتها المتمثلة بموجات اللجوء من المناطق المجاورة للأردن بشكل كبير وفجائي عبر العقود الماضية، بالإضافة إلى عودة الآف المغتربين في الخارج، إلى ازدياد عدد سكان المدينة بشكل كبير وغير مدروس، والذي أثر بدوره على شبكة الطرق المتواضعة أصلاً. حيث تعاني المدينة من انعدام التخطيط المستقبلي لشوارعها التي لم يُراعى في إنشاءها هذا العدد الكبير من المستخدمين. فالطرق في عمّان في معظمها غير قابلة للتوسعة لاستيعاب الكم المتزايد للمركبات، بالإضافة إلى التلكؤ الحكومي في إيجاد حلول جذرية للمشكلة.\nمن جانب آخر، تُعد عمّان من أقل مدن العالم استخدامًا لوسائل النقل العام، حيث لا يستخدم هذه الوسائل سوى 14% (2010) من العدد الإجمالي للسكان في المدينة. وقد أشارت آخر الإحصائيات إلى أن هناك أكثر من مليون سيارة تسير في عمّان، معظمها لنقل شخص واحد. ونتيجة لهذه المشاكل، تحاول الحكومة في إيجاد حلول بديلة عن استخدام المركبات، حيث يُعد مشروع الباص السريع أهمها. فيما أعلنت عن خطط على المدى البعيد تتمثل بإنشاء خطوط للترام أو المترو بموازاة الباص السريع الذي يُعد حل ضروري وآني بسبب الاختناق المروري الذي تعاني منه المدينة، وخصوصًا صيفًا.\n\nسوء توزيع الخدمات\nتعاني عمّان كمعظم المدن العربية بتعدد الأنماط الحياتية والعمرانية بين أحياءها القديمة والحديثة. لكن المختلف في عمّان يرتبط بنشأتها وأصلها القروي وطابعها الريفي. فالجزء الشرقي من المدينة هو الجزء الأقدم والأكثر كثافة بالسكان، يعاني بشكل عام وواضح من سوء توزيع الخدمات وقلة تواجد المؤسسات الحكومية الكبرى، التي تتركز معظمها في الجزء الغربي.\nبالإضافة إلى ذلك، فإن النمط العمراني في عمّان الشرقية يتسم بتراص الأبنية السكنية المبنية على الأغلب من الطوب. بينما الأبراج التي تضم كبرى الشركات والفنادق والمجمعات التجارية باتت تحتل مساحات كبيرة من عمان الغربية التي يتميز البناء فيها بأنه مكسي بالحجر الكلسي.\nولا ينتهي الأمر عند خصائص العمران والمستوى الاجتماعي والمعيشي للسكان، بل يتعداه إلى التخطيط المدني والهندسي، فالشوارع والأرصفة في شرق عمّان بشكل عام ضيقة وقليلة الصيانة بعكس الكثير من شوارع عمّان الغربية. كما أن مستوى النظافة في غرب عمّان يظهر بشكل واضح عند المقارنة مع أحياء المدينة القديمة التي تتكدس الأوساخ على جوانب شوارعها وحاوياتها، بالإضافة إلى مشاكل الصرف الصحي.\nمن جهة أخرى، تعاني معظم أحياء عمّان الشرقية من التهميش الثقافي وندرة في النشاطات الاجتماعية الموجودة في عمّان الغربية. بالإضافة إلى التهميش الاجتماعي، حيث يُلاحظ بشكل كبير أن عمان مقسومة إلى شطرين، يقع الشطر الأول في الناحية الغربية وأغلب سكانه من الأغنياء المُترفين، أما الشطر الثاني فيمتد في الناحية الشرقية من العاصمة وأغلب قاطنيه من الفقراء المحرومين.\nأما بالنسبة إلى التلوث البيئي، فيعاني كل من شرق ووسط عمّان من عدة مصادر للتلوث، أهمها التلوث المائي المتمثل بسيل الزرقاء الذي يمر من منطقة سقف السيل في وسط البلد ومجاري تصريف المياه في ماركا، والتي يندر وجودها في أحياء عمّان الغربية.\n\nمعلومات عامة\nأمناء ورؤساء عمّان\nابتداء منذ تأسيس أول مجلس بلدي للمدينة عام 1909 في

      "summary": "عَمَّان هي عاصمة المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية ومركز محافظة العاصمة. تُعد أكبر مدن المملكة وواحدة من أكبر المدن العربية بالنسبة لعدد السكان، إذ بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2023 حوالي 4.8 مليون نسمة، مما يجعلها أيضًا واحدة من أسرع المدن نموًا بالسكان بالعالم. تقع المدينة في وسط المملكة على دائرة عرض 31 شمالاً وخط طول 35 شرقًا في منطقة تكثر فيها الجبال، فنشأت في الوديان بين الجبال أولاً فضاقت على سكانها، فارتقوا سفوحها واستمروا في الاتساع عبر قممها حتى انتشرت المدينة بأطرافها فوق 20 جبلا.\nتُعتبر عمّان المركز التجاري والإداري للأردن وقلبه الاقتصادي والتعليمي، حيث أصبحت عمّان نقطة استقطاب للكثير من الجاليات العربية لموقعها المتميز ولعمارتها المعاصرة، كما تستقطب عمّان الكثير من السياح سنويًا من أوروبا الغربية وأمريكا الشمالية واليابان وإستراليا ومن الدول العربية المجاورة والقريبة، وكثيرًا من عائلات دول الخليج العربي تحديدًا، إذ تكثر بها المعالم السياحية عمومًا والعلاجية الطبية خصوصاً. كان من نتيجة وقوع عمّان في مثل هذا الموقع الاستراتيجي في بلاد الشام والشرق الأوسط، أن أصبح موقعها يتحكم بالاقتصاد الوطني ويُحرّك 90% من الاستثمار على المستوى الوطني.\nيرجع تاريخ مدينة عمّان إلى الألف السابع قبل الميلاد، وبهذا تُعتبر من ضمن أقدم مدن العالم المأهولة بالسكان إلى يومنا هذا. وعمّان مدينة قديمة أقيمت على أنقاض مدينة عرفت باسم «ربّة عمّون» ثم «فيلادلفيا» ثم «عمّان» اشتقاقاً من «ربة عمّون»، واتخذها العمّونيون عاصمة لهم. وقد أُنشئت المدينة على تلال سبعة، وكانت مركزًا للمنطقة على ما يبدو في ذلك الوقت، وهي إحدى عواصم بلاد الشام الأربع، وهي أيضًا إحدى المدن الشامية القديمة التي أصبحت عاصمةً لإمارة شرق الأردن ومن ثم المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية بعد استقلالها في العام 1946 عن بريطانيا.\nيسكن عمّان الحديثة مجموعة متنوعة من السكان من أصول مختلفة أتوا من مختلف المناطق، منهم من أتى من مدن أردنية قريبة، ومنهم من أتى من فلسطين، ومنهم من القوقاز وسوريا والعراق.\nشهدت أمانة عمان الكبرى مؤخرًا تطورًا كبيرًا، حيث توسعت عمان بشكل لم تشهده المدينة من قبل. ونالت خطة مدينة عمّان الشمولية جوائز عالمية منها جائزة القيادة العالمية في تخطيط المدن وجائزة المدينة عن قارة آسيا لعام 2007. يبلغ عدد المناطق الإدارية في أمانة عمان 22 منطقة مُوزعة جغرافيا تحوي كل منطقة طاقمًا متكاملا من الموظفين، أما من الناحية الإدارية فهناك مجلس أمانة عمان الكبرى الذي يضم 68 عضوا برئاسة أمين العاصمة، والمجلس مقسم بدوره إلى 14 لجنة مختلفة.\nيُشار بالذكر إلى أنه تم اعتماد يوم 2 آذار/ مارس من كل عام يومًا لمدينة عمّان بعد إقرار مجلس الوزراء الأردني قرارًا بذلك في بداية عام 2021، وذلك في إطار الاحتفاء بمرور 100 عام على تأسيس الدولة الأردنيّة.",

Elle est d'ailleurs l'une des plus vieilles villes du monde à être toujours habitée. Avec plus de 4 millions d'habitants en 2016, elle est la plus grande ville de Jordanie, constituant le centre administratif et économique du pays[réf. nécessaire].\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nAmman se trouve dans une zone vallonnée au Nord-Ouest de la Jordanie. La ville était à l'origine bâtie sur sept collines (ce qui lui a valu le surnom de Rome du Moyen-Orient), mais elle s'étend maintenant sur 19 collines (chacune connue sous le nom « jabal » ou montagne). Les principaux quartiers d'Amman tirent leur nom des collines sur les pentes desquelles ils s'adossent.\nLa capitale abrite encore des camps de Palestiniens, créés en 1948 et 1967 en conséquence du Conflit israélo-arabe.\n\nDistricts\nLa municipalité du Grand Amman est constituée de 22 districts :\n\nDémographie\nDepuis 1879, l'évolution démographique de Amman a été :\n\nHistoire\nÀ travers l'histoire, Amman a abrité plusieurs civilisations.\nAu XIIIe siècle av. J.-C., Amman avait pour nom Rabbath Ammon et était la capitale des Ammonites. Elle est ensuite envahie par les Assyriens, suivis par les Perses puis les Grecs. Ptolémée II Philadelphe, le dirigeant lagide d'Égypte, la renomme Philadelphia. La ville fait partie du royaume nabatéen jusqu'en 106 apr. J.-C., où Philadelphia passe sous la domination de l'Empire romain.\n\nEn 324 apr. J.-C., le christianisme devient la religion de l'Empire et Philadelphia le siège d'un évêché pendant le début de l'ère byzantine. Une des églises de cette période existe toujours dans la citadelle.\nPhiladelphia est renommée Amman sous les rois ghassanides, vassaux des Byzantins. Après la conquête musulmane du Levant, elle fleurit sous les Umayyades (capitale : Damas) et les Abbassides (capitale : Bagdad).\nAmman est détruite par plusieurs tremblements de terre et catastrophes naturelles, et reste un petit village et un tas de ruines, dans le pachalik de Damas (1517-1864) puis le vilayet de Syrie (1865-1918), dont le centre administratif local est As-Salt (Saltus).\nEn 1887 arrivent les Circassiens , majoritairement musulmans, qui ont quitté le Caucase à cause de son annexion par les Russes pendant les règnes des tsars Nicolas Ier et Alexandre II (guerre russo-circassienne 1763-1864, nettoyage ethnique des Circassiens) et ont trouvé refuge dans l’Empire ottoman. Une partie d’entre eux s’installe en Jordanie.\nAmman est prise par les Britanniques en septembre 1918 lors de la bataille d'Amman ; elle remplace Salt comme siège administratif. En 1921, Abdallah Ier la choisit comme capitale de son État nouvellement créé, l'émirat de Transjordanie, devenu plus tard le royaume hachémite de Jordanie. Amman reste une petite ville jusqu'en 1948, quand la population augmente considérablement à cause de l'afflux de réfugiés palestiniens venant de ce qui est aujourd'hui Israël. Amman se développa rapidement à partir de 1952 sous le règne de deux rois hachémites, Hussein et Abdallah II.\nLa population de la ville continue d'augmenter à un rythme irrégulier, au fil des différentes immigrations de populations fuyant les guerres ou les territoires occupés (Palestiniens, Syriens, Irakiens, Koweïtiens).\n\nClimat\nAmman a un climat semi-aride avec des hivers doux et pluvieux. Amman est classé Csa selon la classification de Köppen et sa température moyenne annuelle est de 17,5 °C.\nLes précipitations moyennes annuelles sont de 271 mm et il ne pleut pas de juin à septembre. Janvier est le mois où il pleut le plus avec 62 mm.\n\nÉconomie\nCulture\nDepuis 2010, Amman présente son propre Festival de l’Image à l'initiative de l’Institut Français de Jordanie (IFJ), en partenariat avec la Municipalité du Grand Amman, la galerie Darat Al Tasweer. En 2013, les Rencontres d’Arles se joignent aux partenaires.\n\nMédias\nAmman constitue un pôle journalistique important pour les reporters cherchant à couvrir les événements régionaux. De nombreux journaux et chaînes télévisées jordaniennes y sont situées, en particulier la Société radiodiffusion-télévision jordanienne.\nLa ville est également un point d'entrée majeur pour les journalistes arrivant au Moyen-Orient dans le but de diffuser des informations concernant l'Irak ou les Territoires palestiniens par exemple.\n\nTransport\nAmman possède deux aéroports :\n\nl'Aéroport international Reine-Alia (code IATA : AMM • code OACI : OJAI) ;\nl'Aéroport civil d'Amman (code IATA : ADJ • code OACI : OJAM) à vocation régionale.\n\nTourisme\nLe tourisme à Amman se concentre sur les quartiers anciens du centre-ville, qui se trouvent autour du vieux souk (un marché très animé) et de la mosquée du roi Hussein, la plus ancienne de la ville.\nLes constructions sur la colline de la citadelle d'Amman, connue sous le nom Jabal al-Qal'a, datent des époques romaine et byzantine, avec des ajouts ultérieurs des débuts de l'ère de l'Islam. Des fouilles dans les zones nord et est de la citadelle ont mis au jour des restes pouvant remonter à l'âge de bronze. La citadelle abrite aussi le temple d'Hercule qui aurait été construit sous le règne de l'empereur romain Marc-Aurèle.\nDerrière l'emplacement de l'ancien forum se trouve le théâtre romain, le plus grand de Jordanie, avec 6 000 places. Il aurait été construit entre 138 et 161 apr. J.-C. par l'empereur Antonin le Pieux ; il s'adosse au flanc d'une colline et est toujours utilisé pour des spectacles.\nEn 1161, la forteresse a été occupée par les croisés qui lui donnaient le nom d'Ahamant. Elle devient le domaine des Templiers pour quelques années après 1166.\nAmman possède aussi de nombreuses mosquées. Parmi les plus récentes, l'énorme mosquée du roi Abdallah Ier, construite entre 1982 et 1989.

      "content": "## Overview\nAmman (Arabic: عمان ʻammān) is the capital and largest city of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan with a population of about 4 million as of 2020. Amman forms a great base for exploring the country and does, despite popular belief, hold a few items of interest to the traveler. The city is generally well-appointed for the traveller, reasonably well-organized, and the people are very friendly.\nAlthough not seen as much when in the air over Amman, the city holds many surprises for the visitor. Anything can be found in Amman if one asks. Visit Amman's Roman Amphitheatre or stay in a luxurious hotel. Shopping malls are abundant in Jordan. With new construction in Abdali, in a few years the high-end traveller could eat in the most high-end restaurant, stay in a five star hotel or shop in massive malls, all a few metres from one another. Much less is being done to cater to the budget traveller, although urban beautification in the city centre (old town) is cleaning it up and making it more pedestrian-friendly.\nAmman is experiencing a massive (some would say: reckless) change from a quiet sleepy village to a bustling metropolis, some of whose neighbourhoods seem hell-bent on wanting to imitate Dubai. Amman's roads have a reputation of being very steep and narrow in some of the underdeveloped parts of the city but now the city has state of the art highways and paved avenues. The steep terrain and heavy traffic remains challenging for pedestrians and for the rare cyclist. New resorts and hotels dot the city and there are many things for the traveller to see and do. Use Amman as a staging point for travels to nearby cities and settlements in Jordan.\nAmman's ancient roots date its origins to biblical times. Referred to as the City of Seven Hills, the Jordanian capital's cityscape includes a collection of modern-style houses, mosques, souks and ancient historic ruins.\n\n## Understand\nA city built of white stone, Amman's growth has skyrocketed since it was made the capital of Trans-Jordan in the early 1920s, but especially after the 1948 and 1967 wars with Israel when hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees settled there. Another wave arrived after the second Iraq war, with Iraqi refugees forming the majority of newcomers.\nIts history, however, goes back many millennia. The settlement mentioned in the Bible as Rabbath Ammon was the capital of the Ammonites, which later fell to the Assyrians. It was dominated briefly by the Nabataeans before it became a great Roman trade center and was renamed Philadelphia. After the Islamic conquests, Amman became part of the Islamic Empire, until the Ottomans were forced out by the Allies, with the help of the Hashemites, who formed a monarchy that continues to rule until the present.\nToday, West Amman is a lively, modern city. The eastern part of the city, where the majority of Amman's residents live, is predominantly the residential area of the working class and is much older than the west. While possessing few sites, Amman makes a comfortable base from which to explore the northwestern parts of the country.\nAmman is a very diverse city. Palestinian, Iraqi, Circassian, Armenian, and many other ethnic groups reside in Amman. Amman never stops growing.\nDespite the common assertion that most Jordanians understand English, that knowledge is quite limited. Charmingly, the most commonly known English phrase seems to be \"Welcome to Jordan\". The only non-Arabic language used in signposting is English, and you will find \"Tourist Police\" near the major monuments. It never hurts to know a few useful phrases and come prepared with a translation book, or to have the names and addresses of places you are going written in Arabic for use with a taxi driver.\nRemember if you're travelling during the holy month of Ramadan, it is almost impossible to buy food from sunrise to sundown even for tourists. Big shopping malls like City Mall don't let food stores like McDonald's, Sunset and Starbucks sell food during these hours.\n\n## By plane\n31.722535.9933331 Queen Alia International Airport (AMM  IATA). Most travellers to Amman (and to Jordan) will arrive via this airport.Money exchange is available before passport control along with a single ATM (which doesn't take MasterCard); more ATMs are available after customs. This ATM might charge you an additional fee to your regular bank fees (up to 7 JD), so if you have to pay the 40 JD visa fee, you may want to exchange for it before you arrive. At the immigration line you will pay for the visa at the first counter, and then pass through to the second counter to receive the stamp. (Sometimes the visa and Jordan Pass queues may close and redirect you to another queue further down the airport corridors.) Payment by credit card is accepted; however, the credit card machines can be unreliable so you may have to pay in cash.There is only one post office and no postbox in the airport, in arrivals hall of Terminal 1 near the Lost and Found office. If closed, you can put your letters and postcards under the curtain.      (updated May 2023)\nEarly arrival: If you have an early arrival flight and don't want to pay a full-day hotel for just 4 or 5 hr staying there, you can wait in the baggage claim hall at the airport. There are some 50 seats or so available—not too comfortable but acceptable.\nBy bus – The Sariyah Airport Express bus leaves from a marked bus stop on Level 1 (Arrivals) and costs 3.30 JD. It runs from the airport around the clock every hour on the hour, with additional half-hourly departures 08:30–17:30. It is necessary to purchase the ticket from a kiosk outside the airport exit—the kiosk is easily identified after exit but often only takes cash and frequently does not have enough change for larger bills. As of 2025, payment by card seems to work. Note that during night time there is no service to the airport. Additionally, this service may be run by a minibus with extremely limited seating and space for baggage. For most travellers staying in inner Amman, this is a cost effective option to bring you into the city, where you can then call an Uber or Careem for 1–3 JD to your hotel, or leave at the terminus (Northern Station / Tabarbour) and take the BRT (Bus Rapid Transfer) to the Jordan Museum for 0.610 JD. Beware that taxis tend to crowd the bus stops, especially at the final stop, the North Bus Station. These taxis will generally overcharge and very aggressively attempt to sell to you on arrival, including boarding the bus to tell you they are the official taxi service. They are not!\nBy ride hailing – Uber and Careem operate in the city, and while the fare is usually around 15 JD, rides have to be caught upstairs at the departures level. It can be quite expensive and unpredictable to catch an Uber from the city back to the airport. A ride at certain times of day, such as rush hour in the morning, may cost upwards of 25 JD. Furthermore, a driver may accept the fare, take some time to arrive, and then decline the fare upon arrival after realizing that the destination is the airport. Repeatedly searching for a driver could cause a significant delay to your arrival at the airport for your flight.\nBy taxi – Taxi transportation from the airport to Amman should cost around 20 JD. Airport taxi fares are fixed. The fare is only fixed from airport to city: the taxi driver might try to secure a ride from you from the city back to the airport, often with a massive inflated price. It is not hard to get a ride from city to airport for 20 JD. If the driver is trying to charge more, make your stand and say no.\nVery occasionally, regional or charter flights use 31.972535.9913892 Marka Airport (ADJ  IATA).   , centrally located in east Amman a few kilometers beyond the railway station. You may also want to consider arriving and departing Aqaba airport and then continue with an intercity bus—in summer there might be cheap flights there. Also, you may be entitled to a free visa[dead link].\n\n## By bus\nBig, municipal buses serve many parts of Amman. They are used by low-income workers, working-class youth and foreign workers, but are perfectly safe. As of January 2011, the fare was 380 fils. Pay the exact fare (or overpay); bus drivers have no change! You can also load a bus fare cash card with a few JD and swipe the card past a reader as you enter the bus, but places to buy and recharge the card are rare. As of 2025, you can also simply swipe a MasterCard or Visa. Sometimes it doesn't work if you are in a tunnel for instance. In that case, just wait and the bus will reconnect to the internet network when leaving the tunnel, making the payment possible.\nSince a few years, there is a very efficient BRT network (Bus Rapid Transfer) for only 610 fils. With its own roads, it avoid most of the traffic jam. Moreover, it connects the Northern Station to downtown (close to the Jordan Museum), which is very useful if you sleep downtown.\nMost buses are numbered; some display their destination in Arabic only. Bus no. 26 conveniently travels between the old town (Balad) and the 7th Circle along Zahran Street. No. 27 goes from the old town towards the posh Abdoun neighbourhood. No. 43 passes near Shmeisani (as does no. 46) and continues along Mecca Street towards Mecca Mall. Many bus stops are marked by bus shelters, but buses also drop passengers at unmarked spots wherever it is safe to stop. Private minibuses shadow the municipal buses. They do not display route numbers, but a conductor usually shouts out their destination.\n\n## By train\nScheduled services within Jordan and to Damascus have been suspended by Hedjaz Jordan Railway, and they are unlikely to resume. Train excursions run occasionally, as do local services to Zarqa. Neither operate more often than once per week, if at all. Amman's tiny, charming railway station (Mahatta) with its museum is worth a look even if you do not (or cannot) take a train.\n\n## By taxi\nYellow and grey taxis are readily available and can be easily found anywhere in Amman. Hail them in the street as Jordanians do. Taxis for Amman will have a green logo on the driver and passenger doors. The grey ones have an advertisement on top of the car. Resist hailing cabs with another color logo; these cabs are based in other cities and it is illegal for them to pick up fares in Amman. White taxis are shared, and the driver can pick up other fares along the way, which can lead to confusion.\nTaxis in Amman are required by law to use meters and most drivers will reset the meter as soon as a fare is picked up. Most trips within Amman should be under 2 JD, and even a ride from one end of town to the other should not cost more than 5 JD. Taxis are not required to use meters after midnight and drivers often expect double the normal fare for late night trips.\nBeware of drivers offering to give you a short ride \"for free\" as a \"Welcome to Jordan\", especially if you're walking between the Citadel and the Roman Theater; they will then offer to wait for you to take you to your next stop, and will use the \"free\" ride as an excuse not to start the meter. They will then charge you exorbitantly when you arrive at your next stop. Also, be wary of the private cars posing as taxis around the bus stands and stations. They will offer their services asking you to pay as much as you want but later on insist on pocketing more money from you. In case you get one, insist paying the standard price which should not be more than 2–3 JD, anything more is a rip-off.\nThe base rate for the taxi meter is 250 fils, however, some taxis may use old meters which charge 150 fils, it is legitimate for the driver to ask you for 10 extra piasters (100 fils) on top of the quoted meter fare. Make sure though that you note the initial fare as soon as the driver turns the meter on in order not to have the driver ask you for \"the 10 piasters\" when he has a new meter. Drivers are not normally tipped, instead the fare is simply rounded up to the nearest 5 or 10 piasters. Many drivers do not carry much change, so exact change should be given when possible.\nIf a driver is pretending he has no change, it is likely that he just wants to keep it, so that you'll have to pay more. If you mind this, ask the driver to find a nearby shop and get change or get the change yourself from a shop or (if you don't mind being rude) look into their money box to find the change yourself.\nThe going, negotiated rate for a taxi from Amman to the airport is 20 JD or more, although some drivers can be talked down to 15 JD or even 10 JD (which would be close to the metered rate). All taxis are allowed to take passengers to the airport; only special Airport Taxis may take passengers from the airport into town.\nIf you are visiting the Citadel, call it al'Aqal. The driver may try to convince you that the Roman theater is nicer so that he can drop you off there at the bottom of the hill. It's best to be dropped off at the Citadel and walk down the hill to the Roman theater.\nUber and Careem operate in Amman in the same way as anywhere elsewhere. It is best to select the Uber option as opposed to taxi, and card payment as opposed to cash to avoid being asked for more money by the driver. Ubers and Careem are quite cheap, and in most of the core of the city will cost just 1–4 JD depending on distance and demand. Consider tipping if you can, especially since both apps tend to price on distance—given the difficult streets in Amman, it can often mean much longer actual routes than it may seem on a map.\n\n## On foot\nSome areas of Amman are not easily navigated on foot. Be aware when walking through areas of Amman that are not familiar to you because the walkable route might be inconvenient. Unlike other cities frequented by tourists, tools such as Google Maps may not provide an easily traversable route even when used in walking mode. In this case, a walk that appears to be only a few minutes on Google Maps my take half an hour or longer due to unforeseen obstacles. For example, in some areas of Amman you may encounter roads that quickly become highways/expressways, roads up very steep hills, roads that lack a functional sidewalk, roads that have sidewalks but not functional pedestrian crossings at busy intersections, parts of sidewalks that are heavily obstructed by vegetation, and crossings that require the use of an overpass that is far away. It is not impossible to walk in Amman, but some areas of the city are designed primarily for vehicle traffic and it is better to arrange for a ride.\n\n## By car rental\nThere are several car rental companies located in Jordan some will even give you a driver for free if you book a car rental with them. Some of these are Hertz, Sixt Rental Cars, and National.\n\n## By bicycle\nBike tours are a good way to see the local scenery and meet local cyclists. There are a couple of bicycling tour firms in Amman.\n32.0058435.8550421 Tareef Cycling Club, ☏ +962 797253641 (Montaser), +962 797601625 (Baraa), tareef.cycling.club@hotmail.com.

Even so, the city does hold a few items of historical and cultural interest (allow maximum 2 days to see them).\n\n## In the city\n31.954735.93431 Amman Citadel (جبل القلعة, Jabal al-Qal'a) (If you don't want to go the whole way back to the entrance when getting out, try the southern end of the fence at the very west of the citadel complex).

If you listen to it from the view point, where the whole city lies before you, you get the unforgettable acoustic impression.\nDue to accelerated growth the past several decades, the styles of living differs considerably as one travels from east to west throughout Amman. Visitors desiring a more exotic and traditional experience should explore \"Old Amman\", the central downtown, or 31.95018135.9346153 Balad, which features many souqs, shops, and street vendors. Also known as the Souq with traditional sights and smells of the spice market, and shop for authentic souvenirs.

A maze of streets with everything from a fruit market to spices, souvenirs, clothes, hardware. Drink a cool glass of Sugar Cane juice, watch the talented young men make artistic sand designs inside the glass bottles, go and smoke a shisha (hubbly bubbly) in any of the numerous street cafes. Enjoy some tasty falafel in the famous Hashem cafe, enjoy a mansaf dish at Jerusalem restaurant or a nice slice of tasty Kanafe from Habibeh sweets. Busy crowded streets with the real taste of Jordan.\nAbdali, a section of downtown Amman, is being transformed into a modern center for tourists and natives. The plan includes a broad pedestrian boulevard where visitors can shop, eat, or do numerous other activities. New office buildings and residential hi-rises have been built, and more are on the way.

Those in the western parts of the city will most likely be served by those with a competent grasp of the English language, but you run the risk of the items being a bit overpriced.\nSome interesting, original souvenir items that one may consider taking home are:\na keffiyeh, the traditional checkered headpiece of Jordanian men\nan antique brass tea/coffee pot, distinctly Middle Eastern with its artistic etching and curved spout\nolive wood carvings of various objects or figures can be purchase nearly everywhere\nhand-crafted Jordanian daggers\nhand-made Bedouin-style embroidered clothing\nspices.\nAlso Rainbow Street is populated with small antique stores, clothing, restaurants, sheesha tea shops and the well-known Falafel al-Quds, reputedly the \"best\" falafel in the Middle East (some Saudis even financed the opening of one in Saudi Arabia).

At the end of this street and down some stairs you will find Wild Jordan.\n\n## Eat\nAmman features many different styles of restaurants, from traditional Middle Eastern fare to more familiar Western fast food and franchises. Prices range from ultra-cheap to moderate, depending on one's taste buds. For those on a budget, Arabic food is very affordable and can be obtained everywhere.\nArabic food generally consists of several general basic groups. Meat dishes will generally consist of lamb or chicken; beef is more rare and pork is never offered. Shwarma, which is cooked lamb meat with a special sauce rolled in piece of flat bread, is a local favorite. Rice and flat bread are typical sides to any meal. Jordan's specialty, mansaf, is a delicious lamb and rice meal, typically eaten with your hands. Arabs serve plenty of cucumbers and tomatoes, many times accompanied by a white yoghurt sauce. Another favorite is chick pea-based foods such as falafel, hummus, and fuul.\nOne of Amman's most famous local foods restaurant is Hashem in the downtown. This restaurant is one of the favourites of the Royal family and you will see a lot of photographs of the Royal family of Jordan dining in this literal hole-in-the-wall. See the listing below.\nIn an alley off King Faisal St. is Habibah, which serves traditional east Mediterranean sweets such as baklava, but is most famous for serving a traditional dessert known as knafeh nabelseyyeh in reference to its origin from the Palestinian city of Nablus. 800 fils for a \"half quarter kilo\", which is enough for one person (Oct 2018). The original store is easy to spot with the long queue spilling onto the street: if you're just there for the food rather than the vibe, try the new extension that opened 100 m further up on King Hussein St.\nDo not forget the good surprises coming from the countless shawarma outlets and other very cheap places.\n\n## Budget\n31.95209935.9319891 Cliff Hostel (in one of the alleys in the souq nearby the central post office -- there's a small and old sign).

You will often find that bars prefer Amstel and other international brands and do not have Petra beer available.\nThe local spirit is arak, an aniseed or licorice flavoured spirit similar to the Greek ouzo. At 50% alcohol by volume, it is usually served with water and ice, causing the clear liquid to become milky white.\nFor night clubs and bars visit the cosmopolitan West Amman where many Western and American franchises operate here. The nightlife in Amman is not as vibrant as other Middle Eastern cities like Beirut or Tel Aviv, however, there are a few clubs and bars in Amman.\n31.95918535.9177451 Picadelli Pub (Piccadilly Pop) (At Abdali Bus Station). Friendly place that serves alcohol, food, and complimentary snacks 3 JD for beer and wine.\n31.94944135.9308322 La Calle (on Rainbow street). This multi-level bar is known for its half-price happy hour specials.\n31.95225935.9307143 Jafra Café (across from the post office on King Faisal Street (near Hashems), it is upstairs from the DVD store of the same name). A great spot right in the heart of the downtown area. It has an old, rustic feel to it with more young locals than tourists. They have a great selection of nargileh (water pipe) and the entire menu is reasonably priced. Expect to pay about 10 JD for dinner, including an appetizer, kebab, fresh juice and nargileh. Live music starts at 21:00 most night. There is another one near Paris circle in Jebel Al Webdeh.\n31.95826635.9214684 Maestro Bar. Jazz and pub. There have been complaints about their entry policy.\nThe main places people who live in Amman spend time during the evenings are hookah shops.\n31.97304735.8839965 Al-Mawardi (Al-Mawardi Coffee and Hooka Cafe), 15, Siqilya St. (South of Al-Rabia circle), ☏ +962 6 5532010. Coffee shop with traditional hookah, a wide selection of coffee and beverages. Offers Backgammon boards but no card games. 5 JD for a coffee and hookah.\n\n## Sleep\nAmman has the full range of accommodation options from very basic 1-star accommodation to luxurious 5-star facilities.\n\n## Stay safe\nCompared with other capital cities, Amman is a very safe place to visit. Jordanian police and the military maintain a tight grip on law and order. Personal safety is high in Amman - it is safe to walk anywhere in the city at any time of day or night. Serious crime is extremely rare. In 2005, some major hotels were targeted by bombers (connected with the conflict in Iraq). Security measures at all major hotels were increased as a result.\nLGBTQ travellers: While laws criminalising homosexuality have long been repealed in Jordan, before even most of the West, Jordanian society at large remains broadly more socially conservative and LGBTQ acceptance is still rather low. No openly or officially gay bars or clubs exist in Amman as of 2023, and LGBTQ travellers are encouraged to exercise discretion.\n\n## Embassies\nMany details can also be found here: https://www.embassypages.com/jordan\nAustralia, Embassy of the Commonwealth of Australia.

This stop serves the airport, Madaba (0.75 JD), Kerak and others. The small yellow \"airport express\" labeled bus is easily recognized and the driver will also stop on other places if you wave at him. To reach the 7th circle from downtown take bus 41 or any headed to Wadi As-Seir and ask to be dropped of at Dawaar As-Saabe'a (7th circle). Many buses going by the 7th circle also take a turn at the 4th circle coming from Trababour Bus Station.\nThe Trababour Bus Station serves all destinations to the north and to the western border. To get there from downtown, take Serviis (a sedan car that works like a bus) #6 from Raghadan Tourist Service Station (Raghadan Al Seyaha) which is located right next to the Colosseum. The Trababour Bus Station is the last stop on the Serviis' route.\nMany budget hotels like Palace or Farah organize day tours for about 16-18 JD which seems a sensible price, but they do not include entrance fees which could be important. These tours are open to people who don't sleep at the hotel. Classical tours are Jerash, Ajlun, Um Qais, Madaba, Mount Nebo, Baptism site, Dead Sea, and Castles.\nMadaba — Just 45 min away and known as the 'City of Mosaics' for its Byzantine and Umayyad mosaics, especially a large Byzantine-era mosaic map of Palestine and the Nile delta at St. George Church. 0.75 JD by bus from the 7th circle.\nJerash (and Ajlun (Ajloun) Castle) — An ancient Roman City. Besides Petra and Wadi Rum, the most famous site in Jordan. 1 h, 0.75 JD from Trababour Bus Station. Get off right before the Hippodrome, 1 km before the bus station, and enter down the side road through the museum. A private taxi from Amman can be hired for 8-10 JD one-way. Expect to pay as much as 40 JD for a return trip and taxi driver staying on site while you look around. Ajlun Castle is only a short side trip from Jerash, either by bus from the junction south of the Hippodrome or by Taxi.\nUmm Qais — A town north, close to the ruins of the ancient Gadara. Best reached by (rental) car or taxi.\nDead Sea — Mt. Nebo (1 JD) and Jesus' Baptism Site (Al-Maghtas) on the Jordan River are essentially on the way, so consider them as well if you have your own car or taxi. The Dead Sea Amman City Resort is about 20 JD with free showers and swimming pools, but no lockers, towels or mud. Taxi services for travel to the Dead Sea can be purchased for the day 20 JD if you hail a cab from downtown, down town hotels charge 35 JD for the same service. There are a handful of bus lines that also run from Amman on a daily basis. Bus from Mujaharin bus station to Rame costs 1 JD. A taxi from Rame to Amman Tourist Beach 4 JD or less. JETT offers a daily shuttle from Amman (7th circle) to the Dead Sea and back for 7 JD oneway.\nPetra — The most famous site in Jordan. JETT buses, both ordinary and all-inclusive guided tour, connect via the fast (but boring) Desert Highway. It leaves at 6:30 from the JETT bus office at Abdali and in 3.5 hr you'll get to the bus station not even 5 minutes from the entrance of Petra. At 17:00 the JETT bus takes off again to go back to Amman. The price is 8-10 JD one way. Time tables of the JETT Bus: http://www.jett.com.jo/SubPage.aspx?PageId=230%5Bdead+link%5D Also, from the South Bus Station Petra can be reached by tourist buses: they tend to leave when they are full, from 08:30 onwards (3½ hr, 4-5 JD). Another option, go via Ma'an (7 JD) into Wadi Musa (0.5 JD) (town of Petra). Furthermore, for 75 JD or less (depending on how much you haggle) you may be able to get a private taxi from Amman to Petra and back, including the driver waiting around for 6 hr.\nWest Bank and Israel — For information on travelling directly from Amman using the Allenby/King Hussein Bridge, see Jordan#King Hussein \"Allenby\" Bridge.\nSyria — There were two operators (one of them called Challenge) each providing two daily services to Damascus (Sumariya-Terminal) from Amman for SYP500 (SYP50 student discount). The tour takes at least 4 to 5 hr, depending on border formalities. However, considering the current situation in Syria, it is not recommended you head into this direction.",
