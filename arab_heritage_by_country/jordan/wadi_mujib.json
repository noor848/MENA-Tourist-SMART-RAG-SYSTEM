      "content": "The Wadi Mujib (Arabic: وادي الموجب, romanized: Wādī al-Mūjib), is a river in Jordan. The river empties into the Dead Sea circa 420 metres (1,380 ft) below sea level.\nIn ancient times, the river served as the northern boundary of the kingdom of Moab.\nToday, the Wadi Mujib is fed by seven tributaries. The western part of the river is the site of the Mujib Biosphere Reserve, popular for hikes and canyoning amid dramatic rock formations.\n\nGeography\nDuring the last ice age the water level of the Dead Sea reached 180 metres (590 ft) below sea level, about 240 metres (790 ft) higher than it is today. It flooded the lower areas of the canyons along its banks, which became bays and begun to accumulate sediments. As the climatic conditions changed, about 20,000 years ago, the water level of the lake dropped, leaving the re-emergent canyons blocked with lake marl. Most canyons managed to cut through their plugged outlets and to resume their lower courses; but Wadi Mujib abandoned its former outlet by breaking through a cleft in the sandstone. This narrow cleft became the bottleneck of an enormous drainage basin of 6,571 km2 (2,537 sq mi) with a huge discharge and annual sediment yield of 143,780 tonnes. During the years the cleft was scoured deeper and the gorge of Wadi Mujib was formed.\nThe Mujib Dam was completed in 2004 at the bottom of the wadi, where the modern road crosses the river. As a result, a large lake has formed.\n\nMujib Reserve\nThe Mujib Reserve of Wadi Mujib is located in the mountainous landscape to the east of the Dead Sea, in the southern part of Jordan valley, approximately 90 kilometres (56 mi) south of Amman. A 212 km2 (82 sq mi) reserve was created in 1987 by the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature and is regionally and internationally important, particularly for the bird life that the reserve supports. In 2011, UNESCO declared Mujib biosphere reserve. It extends to the Kerak and Madaba mountains to the north and south, reaching 1,277 metres (4,190 ft) above sea level in some places. This 1,708-metre (5,604 ft) variation in elevation of its drainage basin, combined with the valley's year round water flow from seven tributaries, means that Wadi Mujib enjoys magnificent biodiversity that is still being explored and documented. The reserve consists of mountainous, rocky, and sparsely vegetated desert (up to 800 metres (2,600 ft)), with cliffs and gorges cutting through plateaus. Perennial, spring-fed streams flow to the shores of the Dead Sea.\nOver 300 species of plants, 10 species of carnivores and numerous species of permanent and migratory birds have been recorded. Some of the remote mountain and valley areas are difficult to reach, and thus offer safe haven for rare species of cats, goats and other mountain animals.\nThe slopes of the mountainous land are very sparsely vegetated, with a steppe-type vegetation on plateaus. Groundwater seepage does occur in places along the Dead Sea shore, for example at the hot springs of Zara, which support a luxuriant thicket of Acacia, Tamarix, Phoenix and Nerium, and a small marsh. The less severe slopes of the reserve are used by pastoralists for the grazing of sheep and goats.\nThe hot springs of Hammamat Ma'in lie close to the borders of the reserve and popular for tourism and recreation.\nThe Jordanian military have a temporary camp in the south of the reserve.\n\nBiology and ecology\nFauna\nThe reserve is strategically important as a safe stop-over for the huge number of migratory birds which fly annually along the Great Rift Valley between Africa and northeast Europe.\nIt is possible to see the following birds in Wadi Mujib:\n\nLammergeier (Gypaetus barbatus)\nEgyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus)\nEurasian griffon (Gyps fulvus)\nLevant sparrowhawk (Accipiter brevipes)\nLesser kestrel (Falco naumanni)\nSooty falcon (Falco concolor)\nSand partridge (Ammoperdix heyi)\nHume's owl (Strix butleri)\nHooded wheatear (Oenanthe monacha)\nBlackstart (Cercomela melanura)\nArabian babbler (Turdoides squamiceps)\nStriolated bunting (Emberiza striolata)\nTrumpeter finch (Bucanetes githagineus)\nDead Sea sparrow (Passer moabiticus)\nTristram's starling (Onychognathus tristramii)\nMany carnivores also inhabit the various vegetation zones in Mujib, such as the striped hyena and the Syrian wolf.\nAnother common animal in Mujib is the Nubian ibex, a large mountain goat which became threatened as a result of over-hunting.\n\nHistory\nIron Age and biblical narrative\nWadi Mujib, or the Arnon Stream as it was known in biblical times, has always been an important boundary-line. Bible scholars have noticed a seeming contradiction in the Hebrew Bible regarding the ownership of the area between the Arnon and Jabbok rivers. According to Numbers, that area originally belonged to the Moabites and was later conquered by Sihon, king of the Amorites, before the Israelites took it (Numbers 21:13–26). However, Judges presents this land as initially Ammonite territory, which the Israelites took from Sihon.(Judges 11:18).\nFollowing the Israelite settlement the stream divided, theoretically at least, Moab from the tribes of Reuben and Gad (Deuteronomy 3:12–16). But Moab, in fact, lay as much to the north as it did to the south of the Arnon. To the north, for example, were Aroer, Dibon, Medeba, and other Moabite towns. Even under Omri and Ahab, who held part of the Moabite territory, Israel did not hold sway farther south than Ataroth, about ten miles north of the Arnon.\nMesha, King of Moab, in his inscription (Mesha Stele, line 10) says that the Gadites (not the Reubenites) formerly occupied Ataroth, whence he in turn expelled the people of Israel. He mentions (line 26) his having constructed a road along the Arnon. The ancient importance of the river and of the towns in its vicinity is attested by the numerous ruins of bridges, forts, and buildings found upon or near it. Its fords are alluded to by the Book of Isaiah (16:2). Its \"heights,\" crowned with the castles of chiefs, were also celebrated in verse (Numbers 21:28).\n\nHellenistic and Roman periods\nWadi Mujib has been identified as a possible location of the Forest of Jardes, mentioned by the first-century historian Josephus in connection with the later stages of the First Jewish Revolt. In 71 CE, one year after the fall of Jerusalem and shortly after the surrender of the fortress at Machaerus, Roman legate Sextus Lucilius Bassus pursued and killed Jewish rebels in the area.\nIn Roman times, a fort garrisoned by Cohors III Alpinorum, known as Apud Arnona, was situated close to the point where the Via Nova route crossed the Arnon river. One of the river's confluents, Seil Heidan, was known in Roman times as Aidonas.\n\nPanorama\nSee also\nDana Biosphere Reserve\nAzraq Wetland Reserve\nNature Reserves in Jordan\nWadi Zarqa\n Jordan portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThe Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature, Jordan\nFlora and Fauna of Wadi Mujib\nConstraints for Sustainable Eco Tourism in Mujib\nPhotos of Wadi Mujib at the American Center of Research",

      "content": "## Overview\nWadi Mujib is in King's Highway of Jordan, to the east of the Dead Sea. It's a popular site for canyoning.\n\n## Get in\nBe sure to put the activity centre into any route planner, as Google maps will take you to the other end of the Wadi which is about 20 km away from the entrance.\nThe activity centre is around 1 hr 20 min from Amman by car. Public transport options are fairly limited so if you don't have a car the best option might be to hire a taxi. In low season it is possible to hire a taxi from Amman with some haggling for 50 JD (as of Sep 2022) including sufficient waiting time at Wadi Mujib and the Dead Sea (there's a free public beach around 500 m south of the activity centre). Ride-hailing apps Careem and Uber are also options for getting there; prices from 20 JD one way (September 2022), but getting a lift back may prove more of an issue. It is useful to show the taxi driver the quote from Careem when negotiating a price.\n\n## Fees and permits\nEntrance is controlled by a private company, for the basic trail (with no guide) it costs 21 JD (as of Sep 2022) per person, and includes life jacket rental only. Water shoes are available to rent as are dry bags although the latter costs 10 JD (cash only) although you shouldn't count on them keeping your things dry. As of Sep 2022, there are no lockers or other storage facility's available.\nThe number of people allowed in is limited so depending on the time for the day, you may have to wait to buy your ticket. This can take over an hour, so most recommend going early.\nThe main trail is usually only open for 3 months a year depending on water levels, so might be useful to call ahead.\n\n## Eat\nThere is a café on site, but it was closed as of Sep 2022, so it's a good idea to bring your own food and water. There are no shops within walking distance.",
