      "content": "The Dead Sea (Arabic: اَلْبَحْر الْمَيِّت, romanized: al-Baḥr al-Mayyit; or اَلْبَحْر الْمَيْت, al-Baḥr al-Mayt; Hebrew: יַם הַמֶּלַח, romanized: Yam hamMelaḥ), also known by other names, is a landlocked salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east, the Israeli-occupied West Bank to the west and Israel to the southwest. It lies in the endorheic basin of the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.\nAs of 2025, the lake's surface is 439.78 metres (1,443 ft) below sea level, making its shores the lowest land-based elevation on Earth. It is 304 m (997 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342 g/kg, or 34.2% (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, 9.6 times as salty as the ocean—and has a density of 1.24 kg/litre, which makes swimming similar to floating. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea's main, northern basin is 50 kilometres (31 mi) long and 15 kilometres (9 mi) wide at its widest point.\nThe Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean basin for thousands of years. It was one of the world's first health resorts, and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilisers. Today, tourists visit the sea on its Israeli, Jordanian and West Bank coastlines.\nThe Dead Sea is receding at a swift rate; its surface area today is 605 km2 (234 sq mi), having been 1,050 km2 (410 sq mi) in 1930. Multiple canal and pipeline proposals, such as the scrapped Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance project, have been made to reduce its recession.\n\nNames\nThe English name \"Dead Sea\" is a calque of the Arabic name, itself a calque of earlier Greek and Latin names, in reference to the scarcity of aquatic life caused by the lake's extreme salinity.\nHistorical English names include the Salt Sea, Lake of Sodom from the biblical account of its destruction and Lake Asphaltites from Greek and Latin.\nThe name \"Dead Sea\" occasionally appears in Hebrew literature as Yām HamMāvet (ים המוות), 'Sea of Death'. However, the most common name for the lake in both biblical and modern Hebrew—and also its oldest known name—is the 'Sea of Salt' (Hebrew: ים המלח, romanized: Yām HamMelaḥ). Other Hebrew names for the lake also mentioned in the Bible are the Sea of Arabah (Hebrew: ים הערבה, romanized: Yām Ha'Ărāvâ) and the Eastern Sea (Hebrew: היםהקדמוני, romanized: HaYām HaQadmōnî). In the Talmud, it is called 'Sea of Salt' or 'Sea of Sodom'.\nThe Arabic name is al-Bahr al-Mayyit (البحر الميت), or usually without the article al-. It is also known in Arabic as the 'Sea of Lot' (Arabic: بحر لوط, romanized: baḥr Lūṭ, or بُحَيْرَة Buhayrat, بَحْرَة Bahret, or بِرْكَة لوط Birket Lūṭ) from the nephew of Abraham whose wife was said to have turned into a pillar of salt during the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Less often, it has been known in Arabic as the Sea of Zoara (بَحْر صُوغَر) from a formerly important city along its shores.\nBecause of the large volume of ancient trade in the lake's naturally occurring free-floating bitumen, its usual names in ancient Greek and Roman geography were some form of Asphalt Lake (Ancient Greek: Ἀσφαλτίτης, romanized: Asphaltítēs; or no: Ἀσφαλτίτις Λίμνη, romanized: Asphaltítis Límnē; Latin: Lacus Asphaltites) or Asphalt Sea (Ἀσφαλτίτης Θάλασσα, Asphaltítēs Thálassa).\nIt was also known as the 'Dead Sea' (Ancient Greek: Νεκρά Θάλασσα, romanized: Nekrá Thálassa; Latin: Mare Mortuum). Another ancient name is the \"Jewish Sea,\" (Latin: Iudaicum mare), a term used by the second-century Roman historian Tacitus.\n\nGeography\nThe Dead Sea is a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and Palestine's Israeli-occupied West Bank and Israel to the west. It is an endorheic lake, meaning there are no outlet streams.\nThe Dead Sea lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, a geographic feature formed by the Dead Sea Transform (DST). This left lateral-moving transform fault lies along the tectonic plate boundary between the African Plate and the Arabian Plate. It runs between the East Anatolian Fault zone in Turkey and the northern end of the Red Sea Rift offshore of the southern tip of Sinai.\nWater feeds into the Dead Sea from various sources, many small or intermittent, including:\n\nJordan River, international border from the north\nArava Stream (Wadi Arava), international border from the south\nWadi Mujib (Arnon Stream), Jordan, Karak Governorate\nWadi Darga (Wadi Darajeh, Nahal Darga, or Nahal Dragot), West Bank\nWadi al-Hasa (Brook of Zered), Jordan, boundary between Karak Governorate and Tafilah Governorate\nNahal Arugot (Wadi Areijeh or Wadi Argot), mouth at Ein Gedi, Israel\nWadi Wala, Jordan side\nWadi Zarqa Ma'in, Jordan side\nNahal Tur, West Bank\nNahal Og, West Bank\nGroundwater seepage\nDirect rainfall\n(Wadi is the Arabic term for a river valley with a small or intermittent stream; Nahal is the equivalent in Hebrew. The two terms are often used interchangeably in English names for the same body of water.)\nThe water of Wadi Hassa is now completely consumed in Jordan. The Jordan River, which passes through the Sea of Galilee, has been substantially diverted. It currently only contributes about one-sixth of the inflow to the Dead Sea, less than direct rainfall.\nThere are also small perennial springs under and around the Dead Sea, forming pools and quicksand pits along the edges.\nThe Wadi Mujib valley, 420 m below the sea level in the southern part of the Jordan valley, is a biosphere reserve, with an area of 212 km2 (82 sq mi).\nRainfall is scarcely 100 mm (4 in) per year in the northern part of the Dead Sea and barely 50 mm (2 in) in the southern part. The Dead Sea zone's aridity is due to the rainshadow effect of the Judaean Mountains. The highlands east of the Dead Sea receive more rainfall than the Dead Sea itself.\nTo the west of the Dead Sea, the Judaean mountains rise less steeply and are much lower than the mountains to the east. Along the southwestern side of the lake is a 210 m (700 ft) tall halite mineral formation called Mount Sodom.\n\nGeology\nFormation theories\nThere are two contending hypotheses about the origin of the low elevation of the Dead Sea. The older hypothesis is that the Dead Sea lies in a true rift zone, an extension of the Red Sea Rift, or even of the Great Rift Valley of eastern Africa. A more recent hypothesis is that the Dead Sea basin is a consequence of a \"step-over\" discontinuity along the Dead Sea Transform, creating an extension of the crust with consequent subsidence.\n\nSedom Lagoon\nDuring the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene, what is now the valley of the Jordan River, Dead Sea, and the northern Wadi Arabah was repeatedly inundated by waters from the Mediterranean Sea. The waters formed in a narrow, crooked bay that is called by geologists the Sedom Lagoon, which was connected to the sea through what is now the Jezreel Valley. The floods of the valley came and went depending on long-scale changes in the tectonic and climatic conditions.\nThe Sedom Lagoon extended at its maximum from the Sea of Galilee in the north to somewhere around 50 km (30 mi) south of the current southern end of the Dead Sea, and the subsequent lakes never surpassed this expanse. The Hula Depression was never part of any of these water bodies due to its higher elevation and the high threshold of the Korazim block separating it from the Sea of Galilee basin.\n\nSalt deposits\nThe Sedom Lagoon deposited evaporites mainly consisting of rock salt, which eventually reached a thickness of 2.3 km (1.43 mi) on the old basin floor in the area of today's Mount Sedom.\n\nLake formation\nAccording to Kafri, during the late Neogene, i.e. in the Pliocene (ended c. 2.5 million years ago), the eustatic sea level was at 50–100 metres above the current sea level, thus flooding the northern valleys connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the Jordan Rift Valley, which led to the creation of a crooked-shaped lagoon. This high eustatic sea level situation subsequently came to an end, and the ocean could no longer flood the area. Thus, the long lagoon became a landlocked lake, which – due to the high evaporation rate – retreated toward the lower, southern part of the rift valley. However, Mordechai Stein considers the formation process as not yet clarified, speaking of a late Pliocene-early Pleistocene process in which tectonics might also have played a part in blocking water ingression from the Mediterranean to its former bay or lagoon.\nThe first prehistoric lake to follow the Sedom Lagoon is named Lake Amora (which possibly appeared in the early Pleistocene; its sediments developed into the Amora (Samra) Formation, dated to over 200–80 kyr BP), followed by Lake Lisan (c. 70–14 kyr) and finally by the Dead Sea.\n\nLake salinity\nThe water levels and salinity of the successive lakes (Amora, Lisan, Dead Sea) have either risen or fallen as an effect of the tectonic dropping of the valley bottom, and due to climate variation. As the climate became more arid, Lake Lisan finally shrank and became saltier, leaving the Dead Sea as its last remainder.\nFrom 70,000 to 12,000 years ago, Lake Lisan's level was 100 to 250 m (330 to 820 ft) higher than its current level, possibly due to lower evaporation than in the present. Its level fluctuated dramatically, rising to its highest level around 26,000 years ago, indicating a very wet climate in the Near East. Around 10,000 years ago, the lake's level dropped dramatically, probably even lower than today. During the last several thousand years, the lake has fluctuated approximately 400 m (1,300 ft), with some significant drops and rises. Current theories as to the cause of this dramatic drop in levels rule out volcanic activity; therefore, it may have been a seismic event.\n\nSalt mounts formation\nIn prehistoric times, great amounts of sediment collected on the floor of Lake Amora. The sediment was heavier than the salt deposits and squeezed the salt deposits upwards into what are now the Lisan Peninsula and Mount Sodom (on the southwest side of the lake). Geologists explain the effect in terms of a bucket of mud into which a large flat stone is placed, forcing the mud to creep up the sides of the bucket. When the floor of the Dead Sea dropped further due to tectonic forces, the salt mounts of Lisan and Mount Sodom stayed in place as high cliffs (see salt dome).\n\nClimate\nThe Dead Sea has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), with year-round sunny skies and dry air. It has less than 50 millimetres (2 in) mean annual rainfall and a summer average temperature between 32 and 39 °C (90 and 102 °F). Winter average temperatures range between 20 and 23 °C (68 and 73 °F). The region has weaker ultraviolet radiation, particularly the UVB (erythrogenic rays). Given the higher atmospheric pressure, the air has a slightly higher oxygen content (3.3% in summer to 4.8% in winter) as compared to oxygen concentration at sea level. Barometric pressures at the Dead Sea were measured between 1061 and 1065 hPa and clinically compared with health effects at higher altitude. (This barometric measure is about 5% higher than sea level standard atmospheric pressure of 1013.25 hPa, which is the global ocean mean or ATM.) The Dead Sea affects temperatures nearby because of the moderating effect a large body of water has on climate. During the winter, sea temperatures tend to be higher than land temperatures, and vice versa during the summer months. This is the result of the water's mass and specific heat capacity. On average, there are 192 days above 30 °C (86 °F) annually.\n\nChemistry\nWith 34.2% salinity (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, though Lake Vanda in Antarctica (35%), Lake Assal in Djibouti (34.8%), Lagoon Garabogazköl in the Caspian Sea (up to 35%) and some hypersaline ponds and lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica (such as Don Juan Pond (44%)) have reported higher salinities.\nIn the 19th century and the early 20th century, the surface layers of the Dead Sea were less salty than today, which resulted in an average density in the range of 1.15–1.17 g/cm3 instead of the present value of around 1.25 g/cm3. A sample tested by Bernays in the 19th century had a salinity of 19%. By the year 1926, the salinity had increased (although it was also suspected that the salinity varies seasonally and depends on the distance from the mouth of the Jordan).\nUntil the winter of 1978–79, when a major mixing event took place, the Dead Sea was composed of two stratified layers of water that differed in temperature, density, age, and salinity. The topmost 35 meters (115 ft) or so of the Dead Sea had an average salinity of about 30%, and a temperature that swung between 19 and 37 °C (66 and 99 °F). Underneath a zone of transition, the lowest level of the Dead Sea had waters of a consistent 22 °C (72 °F) temperature, salinity of over 34%, and complete saturation of sodium chloride (NaCl). Since the water near the bottom is saturated with NaCl, that salt precipitates out of solution onto the sea floor.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, water inflow to the Dead Sea from the Jordan River was reduced as a result of large-scale irrigation and generally low rainfall. By 1975, the upper water layer was saltier than the lower layer. Nevertheless, the upper layer remained suspended above the lower layer because its waters were warmer and thus less dense. When the upper layer cooled so its density was greater than the lower layer, the waters mixed (1978–79). For the first time in centuries, the lake was a homogeneous body of water. Since then, stratification has begun to redevelop.\nThe mineral content of the Dead Sea is very different from that of ocean water. The exact composition of the Dead Sea water varies mainly with season, depth and temperature. In the early 1980s, the concentration of ionic species (in g/kg) of Dead Sea surface water was Cl− (181.4), Br− (4.2), SO42− (0.4), HCO3− (0.2), Ca2+ (14.1), Na+ (32.5), K+ (6.2) and Mg2+ (35.2). The total salinity was 276 g/kg. These results show that the composition of the salt, as anhydrous chlorides on a weight percentage basis, was calcium chloride (CaCl2) 14.4%, potassium chloride (KCl) 4.4%, magnesium chloride (MgCl2) 50.8% and sodium chloride (NaCl) 30.4%. In comparison, the salt in the water of most oceans and seas is approximately 85% sodium chloride. The concentration of sulfate ions (SO42−) is very low, and the concentration of bromide ions (Br−) is the highest of all waters on Earth.\n\nThe salt concentration of the Dead Sea fluctuates around 31.5%. This is unusually high and results in a nominal density of 1.24 kg/L. Anyone can easily float in the Dead Sea because of natural buoyancy. In this respect the Dead Sea is similar to the Great Salt Lake in Utah in the United States.\nAn unusual feature of the Dead Sea is its discharge of asphalt. From deep seeps, the Dead Sea constantly spits up small pebbles and blocks of the black substance. Asphalt-coated figurines and bitumen-coated Neolithic skulls from archaeological sites have been found. Egyptian mummification processes used asphalt imported from the Dead Sea region.\n\nPutative therapies\nThe Dead Sea area has become a location for health research and potential treatment for several reasons. The mineral content of the water, the low content of pollens and other allergens in the atmosphere, the reduced ultraviolet component of solar radiation, and the higher atmospheric pressure at this great depth each may have specific health effects. For example, persons experiencing reduced respiratory function from diseases such as cystic fibrosis seem to benefit from the increased atmospheric pressure.\nThe region's climate and low elevation have made it a popular center for assessment of putative therapies:\n\nClimatotherapy: Treatment which exploits local climatic features such as temperature, humidity, sunshine, barometric pressure and special atmospheric constituents\nHeliotherapy: Treatment that exploits the biological effects of the sun's radiation\nThalassotherapy: Treatment that exploits bathing in Dead Sea water\nThere is evidence that the  unique attenuation and spectrum of UV rays near the Dead Sea contribute to effective photoclimatherapy for psoriasis, in part because the reduced exposure to solar radiation allows for longer periods of sunbathing.\nRhinosinusitis patients receiving Dead Sea saline nasal irrigation exhibited improved symptom relief compared to standard hypertonic saline spray in one study.\nDead Sea mud pack therapy has been suggested to temporarily relieve pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knees. According to researchers of the Ben Gurion University of the Negev, treatment with mineral-rich mud compresses can be used to augment conventional medical therapy.\n\nLife forms\nThe sea is called \"dead\" because its high salinity prevents macroscopic aquatic organisms, such as fish and aquatic plants, from living in it, though minuscule quantities of bacteria and microbial fungi are present.\nIn times of flood, the salt content of the Dead Sea can drop from its usual 35% to 30% or lower. It temporarily comes to life in the wake of rainy winters. In 1980, after one such rainy winter, the normally dark blue Dead Sea turned red. Researchers from Hebrew University of Jerusalem found it to be teeming with an alga called Dunaliella. Dunaliella in turn nourished carotenoid-containing (red-pigmented) halobacteria, whose presence caused the color change. Since 1980, the basin has been dry and the algae and the bacteria have not returned in measurable numbers.\nIn 2011 a group of scientists from Be'er Sheva, Israel and Germany discovered fissures in the floor of the Dead Sea by scuba diving and observing the surface. These fissures allow fresh and brackish water to enter. They sampled biofilms surrounding the fissures and discovered numerous species of bacteria and archaea.\n\nHuman settlement\nThere are several small communities near the Dead Sea. These include Ein Gedi, Neve Zohar and the Israeli settlements in the Megilot Regional Council: Kalya, Mitzpe Shalem and Avnat. There is a nature preserve at Ein Gedi, and several Dead Sea hotels are located on the southwest end at Ein Bokek near Neve Zohar. Highway 90 runs north–south on the Israeli side for a total distance of 565 km (351 mi) from Metula on the Lebanese border in the north to its southern terminus at the Egyptian border near the Red Sea port of Eilat.\nPotash City is a small community on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, and others including Suweima. Highway 65 runs north–south on the Jordanian side from near Jordan's northern tip down past the Dead Sea to the port of Aqaba.\n\nHuman history\nBiblical period\nDwelling in caves near the Dead Sea is recorded in the Hebrew Bible as having taken place before the Israelites came to Canaan, and extensively at the time of King David.\nJust northwest of the Dead Sea is Jericho. Somewhere, perhaps on the southeastern shore, would be the cities mentioned in the Book of Genesis which were said to have been destroyed in the time of Abraham: Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 18) and the three other \"Cities of the Plain\", Admah, Zeboim and Zoar (Deuteronomy 29:23). Zoar escaped destruction when Abraham's nephew Lot escaped to Zoar from Sodom (Genesis 19:21–22). Before the destruction, the Dead Sea was a valley full of natural tar pits, which was called the vale of Siddim. King David was said to have hidden from Saul at Ein Gedi nearby.\nIn Ezekiel 47:8–9 there is a specific prophecy that the sea will \"be healed and made fresh\", becoming a normal lake capable of supporting marine life. A similar prophecy is stated in Zechariah 14:8, which says that \"living waters will go out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea [likely the Dead Sea] and half to the western sea [the Mediterranean].\"\nDuring the First Temple period, the kingdom of Judah ruled the western shore of the Dead Sea, while Moab controlled the eastern shore. To the south were the Edomites. Judah established several fortresses along its side of the sea. Development in this area was likely driven by new economic opportunities arising from the Dead Sea's natural resources, including salt, bitumen, as well as cash crops. Both Ein Gedi and Jericho on Judah's side were vital centers for cultivating the highly prized Judean date palms during this time. Ein Gedi thrived as a major economic hub in the final century of Judah, before its destruction on the eve of the Babylonian captivity.\n\nHellenistic and Roman period\nGreek and Jewish writers report that the Nabateans had monopolistic control over the Dead Sea.\n\nArchaeological evidence shows multiple anchorages existing on both sides of the sea, including in Ein Gedi, Khirbet Mazin (where the ruins of a Hasmonean-era dry dock are located), Numeira and near Masada. Josephus identified the Dead Sea in geographic proximity to the ancient Biblical city of Sodom. However, he referred to the lake by its Greek name, Asphaltites.\nHerod the Great, king of Judaea, built or rebuilt several fortresses and palaces along the western shore of the Dead Sea, with Masada being the most famous. Another historically important fortress was Machaerus (מכוור), on the eastern bank, where, according to Josephus, John the Baptist was imprisoned by Herod Antipas and died.\nDuring the Hellenistic and Roman periods, some Essenes, an ascetic Jewish sect, settled along the western shore of the Dead Sea. Roman historian Pliny the Elder identifies their location with the words, \"on the west side of the Dead Sea, away from the coast... [above] the town of Engeda\" (Natural History, Bk 5.73). Based on this, It is widely accepted, though still debated, that the Jewish community at Qumran was part of the Essene sect, and that the \"Dead Sea Scrolls\" discovered in nearby caves during the 20th century were their library.\nThe Dead Sea region was active during the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE). Early in the conflict, a group of Sicarii, a radical Jewish sect, seized control of the fortress of Masada and killed the Roman garrison stationed there. After their leader was killed in Jerusalem, the Sicarii fled to Masada and took refuge in the fortress. In 68 CE, Roman commander Vespasian, tasked with suppressing the Jewish revolt, arrived at the Dead Sea and tested its buoyancy by throwing bound, non-swimmer captives into the water. Archaeological evidence suggests that around this time, the Qumran community was destroyed. The Sicarii at Masada continued to resist the Romans after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, holding out until 73/74 CE, when a siege by the Roman Legio X Fretensis resulted in the deaths of 960 inhabitants by suicide, according to Josephus. The Roman camps surrounding Masada were constructed by Jewish slaves who received water from nearby towns, which were supplied with drinking water from the Ein Feshcha springs and other nearby sweetwater sources.\n\nThe town of Ein Gedi, mentioned many times in the Mishna, produced persimmon for the temple's fragrance and for export, using a secret recipe. \"Sodomite salt\" was an essential mineral for the temple's holy incense, but was said to be dangerous for home use and could cause blindness.\n\nByzantine period\nThe sixth-century mosaic known as the Madaba Map indicates that trade across the Dead Sea was very prevalent during the Byzantine period. \nConnected with the Judean wilderness to its northwest and west, the Dead Sea was a place of escape and refuge. The remoteness of the region attracted Greek Orthodox monks since the Byzantine era. Their monasteries, such as Saint George in Wadi Kelt and Mar Saba in the Judaean Desert, are places of pilgrimage.\nThe Jewish village of Ein Gedi, which had been continuously inhabited since the 5th century BCE, was destroyed in the 7th century by a devastating fire.\n\nMedieval period\nFrom the seventh century onwards, the Dead Sea area entered a period of decline and its population decreased. The cultivation of sugarcane near the northern and southern shores of the lake began to develop during the Crusader period and reached its peak under the Mamluks.\n\nModern times\nIn the 19th century the River Jordan and the Dead Sea were explored by boat primarily by Christopher Costigan in 1835, Thomas Howard Molyneux in 1847, William Francis Lynch in 1848, and John MacGregor in 1869. The full text of W. F. Lynch's 1849 book Narrative of the United States' Expedition to the River Jordan and the Dead Sea is available online. Charles Leonard Irby and James Mangles travelled along the shores of the Dead Sea already in 1817–18, but didn't navigate on its waters.\n\nExplorers and scientists arrived in the area to analyze the minerals and research the unique climate.\nAfter the find of the \"Moabite Stone\" in 1868 on the plateau east of the Dead Sea, Moses Wilhelm Shapira and his partner Salim al-Khouri forged and sold a whole range of presumed \"Moabite\" antiquities, and in 1883 Shapira presented what is now known as the \"Shapira Strips\", a supposedly ancient scroll written on leather strips which he claimed had been found near the Dead Sea. The strips were declared to be forgeries and Shapira took his own life in disgrace.\nThe 1922 census of Palestine lists 100 people (68 Muslims and 32 Christians) with \"Dead Sea & Jordan\" as their main locality. The 1931 census shows a sharp increase with 535 people (264 Muslims, 230 Jews, 21 Christians, 17 Druze, and three with no religion) listing \"Dead Sea\" as their main village/town. The 1938 nor 1945 village statistics does not give a number for the general Dead Sea area.\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, hundreds of Jewish religious documents dated between 150 BCE and 70 CE were found in caves near the ancient settlement of Qumran, about one mile (1.6 kilometres) inland from the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea (presently in the West Bank). They became known and famous as the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nThe world's lowest roads, Highway 90, run along the Israeli and West Bank shores of the Dead Sea, along with Highway 65 on the Jordanian side, at 393 m (1,289 ft) below sea level.\n\nTourism and leisure\nBritish Mandate period\nA golf course named for Sodom and Gomorrah was built by the British at Kalia on the northern shore.\n\nIsrael\nThe first major Israeli hotels were built in nearby Arad, and since the 1960s at the Ein Bokek resort complex.\nIsrael has 15 hotels along the Dead Sea shore, generating total revenues of $291 million in 2012. Most Israeli hotels and resorts on the Dead Sea are on a six-kilometre (3.7-mile) stretch of the southern shore.\n\nJordan\nOn the Jordanian side, nine international franchises have opened seaside resort hotels near the King Hussein Bin Talal Convention Center, along with resort apartments, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. The 9 hotels have boosted the Jordanian side's capacity to 2,800 rooms.\nOn 22 November 2015, the Dead Sea panorama road was included along with 40 archaeological locations in Jordan, to become live on Google Street View.\n\nPalestine (West Bank)\nThe portion of Dead Sea coast which Palestinians could possibly eventually manage is about 40 kilometres (25 miles) long. The World Bank estimates that such Dead Sea tourism industry could generate $290 million of revenues per year and 2,900 jobs. However, Palestinians have been unable to obtain construction permits for tourism-related investments on the Dead Sea. According to the World Bank, officials in the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities state that the only way to apply for such permits is through the Joint Committees established under the Oslo Agreement, but the relevant committee has not met with any degree of regularity since 2000.\n\nChemical industry\nBritish Mandate period\nIn the early part of the 20th century, the Dead Sea began to attract interest from chemists who deduced the sea was a natural deposit of potash (potassium chloride) and bromine. A concession was granted by the British Mandatory government to the newly formed Palestine Potash Company in 1929. Its founder, Siberian Jewish engineer and pioneer of Lake Baikal exploitation, Moses Novomeysky, had worked for the charter for over ten years having first visited the area in 1911. The first plant, on the north shore of the Dead Sea at Kalya, commenced production in 1931 and produced potash by solar evaporation of the brine. Employing Arabs and Jews, it was an island of peace in turbulent times. In 1934 a second plant was built on the southwest shore, in the Mount Sodom area, south of the 'Lashon' region of the Dead Sea. Palestine Potash Company supplied half of Britain's potash during World War II. Both plants were destroyed by the Jordanians in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.\n\nIsrael\nThe Dead Sea Works was founded in 1952 as a state-owned enterprise based on the remnants of the Palestine Potash Company. In 1995, the company was privatized and it is now owned by Israel Chemicals. From the Dead Sea brine, Israel produces (2001) 1.77 million tons potash, 206,000 tons elemental bromine, 44,900 tons caustic soda, 25,000 tons magnesium metal, and sodium chloride. Israeli companies generate around US$3 billion annually from the sale of Dead Sea minerals (primarily potash and bromine), and from other products that are derived from Dead Sea Minerals.\n\nJordan\nOn the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, Arab Potash (APC), formed in 1956, produces 2.0 million tons of potash annually, as well as sodium chloride and bromine. The plant is located at Safi, South Aghwar Department, in the Karak Governorate.\nJordanian Dead Sea mineral industries generate about $1.2 billion in sales (equivalent to 4 percent of Jordan's GDP).\n\nWest Bank\nThe Palestinian Dead Sea Coast is about 40 kilometres (25 miles) long. The Palestinian economy is unable to benefit from Dead Sea chemicals due to restricted access, permit issues and the uncertainties of the investment climate. The World Bank estimates that a Palestinian Dead Sea chemicals industry could generate $918M incremental value added per year, \"almost equivalent to the contribution of the entire manufacturing sector of Palestinian territories today\".\n\nExtraction\nBoth companies, Dead Sea Works Ltd. and Arab Potash, use extensive salt evaporation pans that have essentially diked the entire southern end of the Dead Sea for the purpose of producing carnallite, potassium magnesium chloride, which is then processed further to produce potassium chloride. The ponds are separated by a central dike that runs roughly north–south along the international border. The power plant on the Israeli side allows production of magnesium metal (by a subsidiary, Dead Sea Magnesium Ltd.).\nDue to the popularity of the sea's therapeutic and healing properties, several companies have also shown interest in the manufacturing and supplying of Dead Sea salts as raw materials for body and skin care products.\n\nRecession and environmental concerns\nReceding shoreline\nSince 1930, when its surface was 1,050 km2 (410 sq mi) and its level was 390 m (1,280 ft) below sea level, the Dead Sea has been monitored continuously. The Dead Sea has been rapidly shrinking since the 1960s because of diversion of incoming water from the Jordan River to the north as part of the National Water Carrier scheme, completed in 1964. The southern end is fed by a canal maintained by the Dead Sea Works, a company that converts the sea's raw materials. From a water surface of 395 m (1,296 ft) below sea level in 1970 it fell 22 to 418 m (72 to 1,371 ft) below sea level in 2006, reaching a drop rate of 1 m (3 ft) per year.  By 2025 it reached a height of 439 m (1,440 ft) below sea level, a drop of more than 1 m (3 ft) per year. As the water level decreases, the characteristics of the Sea and surrounding region may substantially change.\nAs of 2021, the surface of the Sea has shrunk by about 33 percent since the 1960s, which is partly attributed to the much-reduced flow of the Jordan River since the construction of the National Water Carrier project, and the amount of water from the rains reaching the Dead Sea has diminished even further since flash floods started pouring into the sinkholes left by its shrinkage. The EcoPeace Middle East, a joint Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian environmental group, has estimated that the annual flow into the Dead Sea from the Jordan is as of 2021 less than 100,000,000 cubic metres (3.5×109 cu ft) of water, compared with former flows of between 1,200,000,000 cubic metres (4.2×1010 cu ft) and 1,300,000,000 cubic metres (4.6×1010 cu ft).\n\nSources: Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research, Haaretz, Jordan Valley Authority.\n\nSinkholes and their impact\nThe Dead Sea level drop has been followed by a groundwater level drop, causing brines that used to occupy underground layers near the shoreline to be flushed out by freshwater. This is believed to be the cause of the recent appearance of large sinkholes along the western shore—incoming freshwater dissolves salt layers, rapidly creating subsurface cavities that subsequently collapse to form these sinkholes. As of 2021 Ein Gedi, on the western coast, has been subject to a large number of sinkholes appearing in the area, attributed to the decline in the water level of the Dead Sea.\nAs a result of the sinkholes, most beach resorts along the west shore of the northern basin had to be shut down, with just three remaining near the basin's northwest tip (see List of beaches in Palestine: Dead Sea).\n\nLink to the Red Sea\nIn May 2009 at the World Economic Forum, Jordan introduced plans for a \"Jordan National Red Sea Development Project\" (JRSP). This is a plan to convey seawater from the Red Sea near Aqaba to the Dead Sea. Water would be desalinated along the route to provide fresh water to Jordan, with the brine discharge sent to the Dead Sea for replenishment. Israel has expressed its support and will likely benefit from some of the water delivery to its Negev region.\nAt a regional conference in July 2009, officials expressed concern about the declining water levels. Some suggested industrial activities around the Dead Sea might need to be reduced. Others advised environmental measures to restore conditions such as increasing the volume of flow from the Jordan River to replenish the Dead Sea. Currently, only sewage and effluent from fish ponds run in the river's channel. Experts also stressed the need for strict conservation efforts. They said agriculture should not be expanded, sustainable support capabilities should be incorporated into the area and pollution sources should be reduced.\nIn October 2009, the Jordanians accelerated plans to extract around 300 million cubic metres (11 billion cubic feet) of water per year from the Red Sea, desalinate it for use as fresh water and send the waste water to the Dead Sea by tunnel, despite concerns about inadequate time to assess the potential environmental impact. According to Jordan's minister for water, General Maysoun Zu'bi, this project could be considered as the first phase of the Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance.\nIn December 2013, Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement for laying a water pipeline to link the Red Sea with the Dead Sea. The pipeline would be 180 km (110 mi) long and is estimated to take up to five years to complete. In January 2015 it was reported that the level of water was dropping by 1 m (3.3 ft) a year.\nOn 27 November 2016, the Jordanian government shortlisted five consortia to implement the project. Jordan's ministry of Water and Irrigation said that the $100 million first phase of the project would begin construction in the first quarter of 2018, and would be completed by 2021. The project was officially abandoned in June 2021, having never broken ground.\n\nSee also\nAral Sea\nList of bodies of water by salinity\nList of drying lakes\nList of places on land with elevations below sea level\nMediterranean–Dead Sea Canal\nBenjamin Elazari Volcani\nPEF rock with the Dead Sea level reference line used between 1900 and 1913\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nThe World Bank, 2013, \"The Red Sea – Dead Sea Water Conveyance Study Program\", and source of basic data on the Dead Sea.\nYehouda Enzel, et al., eds (2006) New Frontiers in Dead Sea Paleoenvironmental Research, Geological Society of America, ISBN 978-0-8137-2401-0\nNiemi, Tina M., Ben-Avraham, Z., and Gat, J., eds., 1997, The Dead Sea: The Lake and Its Setting: N.Y., Oxford University Press, 286 p.\nWorld Bank, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Department, Area C and the Future of the Palestinian Economy, October 2, 2013\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Dead Sea at Wikimedia Commons\n Dead Sea travel guide from Wikivoyage   (Israeli and West Bank part and Jordanian part)\n The dictionary definition of Dead Sea at Wiktionary\nPorter, Josias Leslie (1878). \"Dead Sea\" .

      "summary": "The Dead Sea (Arabic: اَلْبَحْر الْمَيِّت, romanized: al-Baḥr al-Mayyit; or اَلْبَحْر الْمَيْت, al-Baḥr al-Mayt; Hebrew: יַם הַמֶּלַח, romanized: Yam hamMelaḥ), also known by other names, is a landlocked salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east, the Israeli-occupied West Bank to the west and Israel to the southwest. It lies in the endorheic basin of the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.\nAs of 2025, the lake's surface is 439.78 metres (1,443 ft) below sea level, making its shores the lowest land-based elevation on Earth. It is 304 m (997 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342 g/kg, or 34.2% (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, 9.6 times as salty as the ocean—and has a density of 1.24 kg/litre, which makes swimming similar to floating. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea's main, northern basin is 50 kilometres (31 mi) long and 15 kilometres (9 mi) wide at its widest point.\nThe Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean basin for thousands of years. It was one of the world's first health resorts, and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilisers. Today, tourists visit the sea on its Israeli, Jordanian and West Bank coastlines.\nThe Dead Sea is receding at a swift rate; its surface area today is 605 km2 (234 sq mi), having been 1,050 km2 (410 sq mi) in 1930. Multiple canal and pipeline proposals, such as the scrapped Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance project, have been made to reduce its recession.",

      "title": "البحر الميت",
      "content": "البحر الميت هو بحيرة ملحية مغلقة تقع في أخدود وادي الأردن ضمن الشق السوري الأفريقي، على خط الحدود الفاصل بين الأردن وفلسطين التاريخية (الضفة الغربية والداخل المحتل). يشتهر البحر الميت بأنه أخفض نقطة على سطح الكرة الأرضية، حيث بلغ منسوب شاطئه حوالي 400 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر حسب سجلات عام 2013. كما يتميز البحر الميت بشدة ملوحته، إذ تبلغ نسبة الأملاح فيه حوالي 34%، وهي ما تمثل تسعة أضعاف تركيز الأملاح في البحر المتوسط، وواحدة من أعلى نسب الملوحة بالمسطحات المائية في العالم. وقد نتجت هذه الأملاح لأن البحيرة هي وجهة نهائية للمياه التي تصب فيه، حيث أنه لا يوجد أي مخرج لها بعده.\nيصل عرض البحر الميت في أقصى حد إلى 17 كم، بينما يبلغ طوله حوالي 70 كم. وقد بلغت مساحته في عام 2010 حوالي 650 كم2 إذ تقلصت خلال الأربع عقود الماضية بما يزيد عن 35%. كما يلعب المناخ الصحراوي للمنطقة الذي يمتاز بشدة الحرارة والجفاف ومعدلات التبخر العالية دورًا كبيرًا في زيادة تركيز تلك الأملاح فيه.\nلقد عانى منسوب البحر الميت مؤخرًا من التراجع المستمر، حيث يرجع هذا الأمر إلى عدد من الأسباب الرئيسية، كالاستخدام المكثف لمصادر المياه، وأهمها نهر الأردن، وضخ المياه في الحوض الجنوبي، حيث يتكون البحر الميت حاليًا من حوضين؛ شمالي وجنوبي يقسمهما شبه جزيرة اللسان. ونتيجة للانخفاض المستمر لهذا المستوى، تعرض الجزء الجنوبي من البحيرة للجفاف، حيث إنّ الجزء الجنوبي أقل عمقًا من نظيره الشمالي، ويصل ارتفاع منسوب شاطئه إلى 401 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر. ومع تجفيف الجزء الجنوبي، تم إنشاء برك لتبخير المياه وإنتاج البوتاس والمواد الكيماوية الأخرى مثل المنجنيز والمغنسيوم والبرومين في مصانع البوتاس الإسرائيلية، وشركة البوتاس العربية في الأردن. وتحتاج تلك البرك إلى ضخ كبير من مياه البحر الميت وتبخيرها، مما أثّر تأثيرًا كبيرًا على زيادة انخفاض مستوى سطح البحر.\nلقد بلغ المعدل السنوي لانخفاض مستوى سطح البحر خلال العقد المنصرم بمقدار يعادل الفقدان لمدة سنة كاملة، حيث أصبح المستوى ينخفض حوالي متر واحد كل عام. ولقد زاد هذا المعدل في عام 2012 بشكل واضح، فكان انخفاض مستوى البحر 1.40 متر. وقد أدى الانخفاض التراكمي في مستوى المياه إلى تغيرات كبيرة أيضا في تضاريس المناطق المجاورة وفي البحر الأبيض المتوسط بما في ذلك تغيرات لا يمكن الرجوع عنها في الجزء الشمالي، من خلق للمجاري، والانسحاب من الشواطئ، والأضرار التي لحقت بالبنية التحتية (الطرق والجسور) والمحميات الطبيعية.\nيُعد البحر الميت مهماً جدًا للصناعة والسياحة في المنطقة، حيث تُعتبر تركيبة مياهه مختلفة عن المياه الطبيعية، باحتوائها على تركيز عالي من الكالسيوم والبوتاسيوم. ويُستغل هذا في مصانع الجانبين الأردني والإسرائيلي. وترجع الأهمية التاريخية والسياحية لمنطقة حوض البحر الميت إلى البحر نفسه وإلى شواطئه، حيث توجد بعض المعالم الأثرية والدينية الهامة في المنطقة مثل مسعدة، وخربة قمران، وكهف النبي لوط، بالإضافة إلى التشكيلات الملحية الطبيعية، والمناخ السائد فيه، فكلها جعلت من البحر الميت نقطة جذب سياحية عالمية، وخصوصًا فيما يتعلق بالسياحة العلاجية. وتحوي المنطقة على آلاف الغرف الفندقية، حيث تتركز في الجزء الشمالي الشرقي في الأردن، بالإضافة إلى الجزء الغربي المطل على الحوض الجنوبي. وقد رُشح ليكون أحد عجائب الدنيا السبع الطبيعية في نطاق البحيرات.\nورغم أن دولة فلسطين لها جزء يطل على البحر الميت إلا أن السلطات الإسرائيلية لا تسمح للفلسطينيين باستغلال مواردهم من البحر، بل تمنعهم تماما من الذهاب إلى ساحل البحر الميت بحجة الأمن. وتشكل حقوق الفلسطينيين في استغلال نصيبهم من البحر الميت نقطة هامة في مباحثات السلام، بالإضافة إلى حقوقهم في مياه الشرب.\n\nالتسمية\nأُطلق على البحر الميت تاريخيّا عدة أسماء قديمة في العهد القديم مثل: «بحر الملح» و«بحر العربة» و«البحر الشرقي» و«عمق السديم». وفي عهد عيسى المسيح عُرف بـ «بحر الموت»، و«بحر سدوم» نسبة إلى منطقة سدوم المجاورة، كما دُعي «البحيرة المنتنة» لأن مياهه وشواطئه لها رائحة منتنة. كما دُعي «بحيرة زغر» نسبة إلى بلدة زُغر التي كانت تقع على شاطئه الجنوبي الشرقي، واُطلق عليه اسم «بحر الزفت» نسبةً إلى قطع الزفت التي كانت تطفو على سطحه في بعض الأحيان وخاصة عند حدوث الزلازل. وقد كان بعض سكان المنطقة يتاجرون في قطع الزفت التي يستخرجونها ويبيعونها. كما ذكره المقدسي في كتابه «أحسن التقاسيم في معرفة الأقاليم» باسم «البحيرة المقلوبة». وقد سُمي أيضًا «بحيرة لوط» نسبةً إلى النبي لوط الذي سكن وقومه بالقرب منه قبل أن يحل بهم العذاب. أما الإغريق فكانوا أول من أطلق عليه اسم «البحر الميت» لعدم وجود حياة فيه.\nوحسب نظرية عالم الإراضة البروفيسور ليو بيكارد كان في الماضي جزءا من بحيرة واسعة حلوة المياه امتدت على منطقة غور الأردن ومرج ابن عامر وصبت في البحر الأبيض المتوسط. وحسب هذه النظرية أسفرت التغييرات في علوّ الأرض قبل مليوني عام تقريباً إلى انقطاع الوصلة بين تلك البحيرة والبحر الأبيض المتوسط، وإلى تضيق البحيرة إلى بحيرة طبريا، نهر الأردن والبحر الميت. فأدى حصر مياه البحر الميت، وتبخر الماء إلى زيادة نسبة الأملاح فيه.\n\nالجغرافيا\nيحد البحر الميت من الشرق جبال محافظة مادبا ومحافظة الكرك في الأردن، ومن الغرب الضفة الغربية وجبال الخليل في فلسطين. أما شمالاً فيحده منخفض البحر الميت ومصب نهر الأردن، ومن الجنوب جرف خنزيرة، الذي يُعتبر بداية وادي عربة. يُعتبر خط التقسيم فيه حدًا فاصلاً بين الأردن وفلسطين تماشيًا مع نهر الأردن في الشمال، ووادي عربة في الجنوب. يقع بين دائرتيّ عرض 31.03 و31.43 شمالاً، وبين خطيّ طول 35.21 و35.35 شرقًا. يبعد عن القدس 24 كم إلى الشرق، وعن عمّان 38 كم إلى الجنوب الغربي. تبلغ مساحته الأصلية حوالي 1000 كم2، إلا أنها تقلّصت خلال الأربع عقود الماضية إلى حوالي 650 كم2. ويبلغ أقصى عرض له 17.5 كم، وأضيق نقطة تقع عند مضيق اللسان بعرض 2 كم، أما أعمق نقطة فيه فتقع على بعد 5 كم جنوب غرب مصب وادي زرقاء ماعين، ويبلغ عمقها 399 م، بينما ينخفض سطحه بحوالي 395 عن سطح البحر المتوسط.\nوتحف الشواطئ الشرقية والغربية للبحر الميت منحدرات عمودية على شكل أبراج صدعية والتي تشكل جزءاً من الشق السوري الأفريقي. إن منحدرات الوادي تتجه إلى أعلى برقة إلى ناحية الشمال في اتجاه نهر الأردن وإلى ناحية الجنوب في اتجاه وادي عربة. ومن الناحية التاريخية فإن البحر الميت يتكون من حوضان: الحوض الرئيسي الشمالي والذي يبلغ عمقه 320 مترًا (في عام 1997) والحوض الجنوبي الضحل والذي منه تراجع البحر الميت منذ عام 1978. والحوضين منقسمان عن طريق شبه جزيرة لسان ومضايق الموت التي لديها تل من الطمي.\n\nالمناخ\nيتمتع البحر الميت بسماء مشمسة على مدار السنة، بالإضافة إلى الهواء الجاف. وتتساقط الأمطار على المنطقة بشكل قليل جداً بأقل من 50 ملم (2 بوصة) بينما يبلغ متوسط درجة الحرارة في الصيف بين 32 و39 درجة مئوية. وتتراوح درجات الحرارة في فصل الشتاء المتوسط بين 20 و23 درجة مئوية. كما تعتبر نسبة الرطوبة منخفضة حيث توازي 35% في معدلها. أما الإشعاعات الشمسية، فلقد دلّت الدراسات على وجود طبقة غنية بالأوزون فوق سطح البحر تصل إلى ارتفاع 25 كيلومتراً، ويقوم الأوزون بالإضافة إلى بخار الماء فوق البحر بعملية ترشيح وفلترة للأشعة الفوق بنفسجية.\nويُعد تركيز الأكسجين في هواء منطقة البحر الميت الأعلى في العالم، بصفته المنطقة الأكثر انخفاضًا. وتصل نسبة الأكسجين فيه إلى 36%، علمًا بأن النسبة العالمية تصل إلى 26%. أما بالنسبة إلى الضغوط الجوي في منطقة البحر الميت، فيترواح بين 796 و799 ملم زئبقي، وبهذا يُعتبر الأعلى في العالم.\n\nالجيولوجيا\nيشكل وادي الأردن جزءاً من الأخدود العظيم (حفرة الانهدام التاريخية) والذي يمتد من تركيا إلى شرق أفريقيا. وقد تشكل نتيجة تغيرات جيولوجية شهدتها القشرة الأرضية منذ ملايين السنين، وقد تشكّل في قلبها البحر الميت الذي كان يمتد في الأصل على طول 360 كلم من العقبة جنوبًا إلى بحيرة طبريا شمالاً. يعتبر وادي الأردن بأرضه الخصبة ومناخه الدافئ، والبحر الميت بمياهه العلاجية، مركز جذب سكاني عبر التاريخ، فقد شهد هذا الوادي العديد من الأقوام والحضارات التي تعود إلى عصور قديمة جدًا. وقد تم الكشف عن أكثر من 200 موقع أثري حتى اليوم، ومعظم هذه المواقع المحيطة بمنطقة البحر الميت تتصل اتصالاً وثيقًا بأحداث ذُكرت في الكتاب المقدس، ومن أهمها كهف النبي لوط.\nوقد أجرى بعض الباحثين الإسرائيليين مسحًا جيولوجيًا لقاع البحر الميت عام 1967، وقالوا: «يبدوا أن قاع البحر الميت الحالي مكون من صخور تكوين أصدم الملحي الذي يقع تحت الحوض الجنوبي للبحر الميت». بمعنى أن هذه الكتلة كانت تحت قرى النبي لوط، وأن تكوين هذه البقعة المنخفضة كما ورد مشابه لتكوين أصدم، بينما المحيط الموجود فيه هو من تكوينات جيولوجية مختلفة عنها، هذا بالإضافة إلى وجود صدوع مستعرضة حول هذه البقعة تؤكد أنها لم تكن أساسًا ضمن التكوين الصخري الموجود فيه، وإنما جاءته من منطقة أخرى، وهذا يؤيد حدوث مثل هذا الانزلاق لهذه الكتلة الصخرية. كما يؤيد صحة هذا الدليل صورة الأقمار الصناعية لقاع البحر الميت، والتي يظهر فيها ست نقاط يُعتقد أنها تجمعات سكانية تمثل قرى النبي لوط، وصورة غواصة بريطانية لنفس المنطقة عام 1957 يظهر فيها أيضًا آثار مساكن وقرى مطموة بالملح.\n\nالتشكل\nيُعتبر البحر الميت ظاهرة طبيعية نادرة الوجود في العالم، فهو بحيرة مغلقة لا تتصل بالبحار الخارجية المجاورة (البحر المتوسط والبحر الأحمر). كما يقع في منطقة كانت جزءاً من الموطن الأصلي للإنسان الأول، ومهبطًا للديانات السماوية الرئيسية، ومكانًا لنشوء الحضارات القديمة، ومعبرًا للحركات التجارية والغزوات العسكرية عبر العصور التاريخية المتتابعة.\n\nيعود بداية التشكل الجيولوجي للبحر الميت إلى أواخر العصر الثلاثي، أي قبل حوالي 3 - 7 مليون سنة. فقد تكوّن على أنقاض البحيرات القديمة التي شغلت الانهدام الأردني حيث يقول علماء الجيولوجيا: أن «بحر تيش» أو Tythas الذي يشغل البحر المتوسط جزءاً من مكانه، كان يغطي أغلب أراضي المنطقة العربية، وبعد انحساره وتراجعه ووصوله إلى الشكل الحالي للبحر المتوسط، بقيت منطقة الغور ممتلئة بالمياه مكونة بحيرة أصدم القديمة التي كانت تتصل بالبحر المتوسط بواسطة مرج بن عامر ثم غور الأردن الأوسط حتى عصر الميوسين. وبعد عصر الميوسين، انقطع اتصال البحيرة الأردنية القديمة (بحيرة ما بعد أصدم) بالبحر المتوسط. وأخذت تنحصر شيئاً فشيئاً نتيجة لارتفاع مستوى التبخر في المنطقة بسبب درجات الحرارة المرتفعة. ويعتقد العلماء بأن البحيرة تعرضت لعملية هبوط ثانية بسبب الضغط الكبير الواقع عليها، بسبب تركز الأملاح في قاعها حتى تكوّن البحر الميت بشكله الحالي والذي يعتبره علماء الجيولوجيا حالة دراسية نادرة الوجود، حيث يقع أطول فالق إزاحي قاري في العالم يصل امتداده إلى أكثر من 1000 كم مصحوب بإزاحة جانبية تبلغ حوالي 105 كم. وقد لفت انهدام البحر الميت بتشكيله الجيولوجي ونشاطه التكتوني انتباه الكثير من العلماء في شتى مجالات علوم الأرض.\nتتميز مياه البحر الميت بشدة ملوحتها التي تصل إلى 340 غم/ لتر في أعماقه، وهي نسبة كبيرة جدًا، إذ تبلغ الملوحة فيه عشرة أضعاف ملوحة البحار والمحيطات. ويختزن البحر الميت في باطنه ثروة هائلة لمجموعة كبيرة من الأملاح قد لا تنضب بسبب ضخامة حجمها ودخولها في الصناعات الحديثة. اختلفت الآراء حول أصل تكون هذه الأملاح، وفيما يلي استعراض لثلاث نظريات تفسر كيفية تكونها:\n\nنظرية ترسيب الأملاح البحرية: وتقول أن هذه الأملاح جاءت من مصدرين هما الترسيب المائي، والترسيب الجوي.\nنظرية تجمع الأملاح التحتية: وتقول أن الأملاح تكونت من مياه نهر الأردن والأودية والينابيع الجانبية التي ترفد البحر الميت مباشرة، فهي تحتوي على كميات هائلة من الأملاح مشابهة لأملاح البحر الميت.\nنظرية الأمطار البركانية: وتقول أن جزءاً من أملاح البحر الميت تكون نتيجة العذاب الذي حل بقوم لوط.\n\nالتركيب الكيمائي\nتُقدر كمية التبخر في مياه البحر الميت بحوالي 1600 ملم في العام. وبحسب الفحوصات التي أُجريت على مياهه فإن عملية التبخر والتغيرات الكيمائية تحدث خلال الأربعين مترٍ العليا، وما دونها فهو ثابت لا يتغير. إذاً تختلف كمية ونوعية الأملاح حسب العمق. وتبلغ الأملاح المذابة 44 مليار و957 مليون طن. ومن هذه الكمية تُقدر المواد التالية بملايين الأطنان: كلوريد المغنيسيوم حوالي 23 ألف مليون طن، ملح الطعام حوالي 12 ألف مليون طن، كلوريد الكالسيوم حوالي 6 الآف مليون طن، كلوريد البوتاسيوم حوالي ألفين مليون طن، بروميد المغنسيوم حوالي 975 مليون طن، كبريتات الكالسيوم حوالي 105 مليون طن، بيكربونات الكالسيوم حوالي 46 مليون طن، وكلوريد الروبيديوم حوالي 12 مليون طن.\nومن الجدير بالذكر، أن هناك مصادر أخرى عملت على زيادرة نسبة الأملاح في البحر الميت كالينابيع الساخنة والمعدنية مثل: ينابيع الزهار الكبريتية، وحمامات زرقاء ماعين، إذ أن التحاليل التي اُُجريت على مياه هذه المصادر دلت على نفس التركيب الكيماوي لمياه البحر الميت، حتى أن التحاليل الكيميائية التي أُجريت لمياه منجم بترول أسدم أظهرت علاقتها بمياه البحر الميت.\nإن قوة تركيز أملاح البحر الميت التي ينفرد بها عن كل بحار العالم الداخلية هي عجيبة في حد ذاتها. ولا يقف الأمر عند هذا الحد، بل أن التركيب الكيماوي لمياه هذا البحر يختلف أيضًا عن غيره من بحار العالم الداخلية الأخرى، فهو يتكون في معظمه من أملاح الكبريتات والكربونات. والغريب في الأمر أيضًا، أن أملاح الكالسيوم تكاد تكون معدومة، إذ أن ذلك لا يحدث لأي بحر داخلي مثل البحر الميت. والأغرب من ذلك كله وجود كمية البروم العالية التي تبلغ 5920 ملغم لكل لتر والتي لا يوجد مثلها في أي بحر معروف، حيث أن كمية البروم في المحيطات تبلغ 290 ملغم/ لتر وفي البحار المالحة 1000 ملغم/ لتر.\n\nالروافد المغذية\nيغذّي البحر الميت بالإضافة إلى نهر الأردن، عدد من الوديان والسيول الممتدة على جانبيه الغربي والشرقي. إذ يبلغ عددها من الجانب الغربي 23 واديًا وسيلاً، فيما يبلغ عددها من الشرق 5 فقط.\nوتبلغ مساحة المجاري المتعلقة بالبحر الميت 40,6 كم2. وتأتي معظم تدفقات المياه إلى البحر الميت من مناطق ذات الكثافة المطرية النسبية لمجرى نهر الأردن إلى الشمال والمنحدرات العمودية للوادي المتصدع لشرق وغرب البحر الميت. وإلى الجنوب، يغطي خط تقسيم مياه وادي عربة المناطق القاحلة للنقب وصحراء الأردن الجنوبية.\n\nمشروع القناة\nيمر مُستوى المياه في هذا البحر التاريخي يتراجع حاليًا بمُعدلات لا تُصدق تاركًا خلفة آلاف الحفر، حيث يوجد حاليًا ما يُقارب 3000 حُفرة على الجانب الغربي ومئات الحُفر على الجانب الشرقي، وذلك بارتفاع شديد في وتيرة تشكل هذه الحُفر بشكل فُجائي، في وقت كان البحر يحتوي فيه على 40 حفرة فقط في العام 1990. الخُبراء في هذه المجال يُشيرون إلى أن مثل هذه الحفر تظهر حاليًا بمُعدّل حُفرة واحدة يوميًا، وأن المخيف فيها هو عدم وجود طريقة بمعرفة مكان أو توقيت ظُهورها. ظهور هذه الحفر متعلق بصورة مباشرة بتعرض البحر الميت للجفاف بمُعدل متر واحد سنويًا، بحيث تنهار الأرض فجأةً وتتشكّل حفر كبيرة أحيانًا مما يُشكل خطرًا على المناطق المُحيطة بالبحر من مزارع وطرقات وحتى أبنية كالفنادق أو المنازل. وتتشكل الحُفر هذه نتيجةً لتفاعُل المياه العذبة القادمة من مياه الأمطار أو بعض الينابيع تحت الأرض بالأملاح الموجودة في الأرض بعد تعرُض مساحات جديدة للتجفيف.\nولإنقاذ البحر الميت من الجفاف، قام الأردن بالتعاون مع كل من السلطة الفلسطينية وإسرائيل بالتخطيط لمشروع اُطلق عليه «قناة البحرين»، وهو مشروع مقترح لشق قناة تربط بين البحر الميت وأحد البحار الـمفتوحة (البحر الأحمر أو البحر الأبيض المتوسط)، مستفيدا من 400 متر الفرق في منسوب المياه بيـن البحار. قد تعوض المياه المتدفقة عبر القناة انخفاض مستوى البحر الميت بسبب تحويل المياه إلى إسرائيل بواسطة سد دغانيا المقام على نقطة الاتصال بين بحيرة طبريا ونهر الأردن. وسحب المياه الحلوة المتدفقة طبيعيًا إلى البحر الميت إلى أجهزة الري الإسرائيلية والفلسطينية والأردنية. بالمقابل، عارض المشروع الكثير من المنظمات البيئية في المنطقة، حيث أشارت عدد من الدراسات أن تدفق حوالي ملياري متر مكعب سنويًا من مياه البحر الأحمر إلى البحر الميت سيحدث تأثيرات بالغة الخطورة على كنوز وثروات البحر الأحمر، حيث مناطق الشعب المرجانية وحدائقها التي لا تقدر بثمن، كما سيغير من تركيبة البحر الميت. من جهة أخرى، يرى نشطاء سياسيون أن للمشروع أبعادًا سياسية وإستراتيجة تضر الأردن والسلطة الفلسطينية، وهي بناء المستوطنات الإسرائيلية، وجلب المزيد من المهاجرين وخلق واقع ديموغرافي جديد في المنطقة وخلق رافد بشري مستمر لقواها العسكرية.\nوقد تم التوقيع رسميًا على اتفاقية بين الأطراف الثلاثة في كانون الأول/ ديسمبر 2013 لمد خط أنابيب ينقل المياه من البحر الأحمر إلى البحر الميت، حيث استمر تداول خطة ربط البحرين الأحمر والميت على مدار عقود وخضعت للعديد من التغيرات، كما أنها كانت مُتضمنة أيضًا في اتفاقية السلام بين إسرائيل والأردن عام 1994. ويشمل المشروع مرحلة أوليّة سيتم خلالها بناء خط أنابيب لنقل المياه طوله 180 كم من محطة تحلية المياه في ميناء العقبة الأردني الموجود على الساحل الشمالي الشرقي للبحر الأحمر إلى البحر الميت.\nويهدف المشروع إلى منع تدهور وانكماش البحر الميت وتوصيل المياه النقية إلى الأردنيين والفلسطينيين والإسرائيليين. ويعاني الأردن خصيصًا مؤخرًا من تداعيات نقص المياه بسبب زيادة عدد السكان في ظل استمرار تدفق اللاجئين من سوريا. وقد أعلن البنك الدولي أن البرنامج التجريبي قابل للتطبيق بتكلفة 10 مليارات دولار أمريكي، لكنه حذر وكذلك المنظمات البيئية من العديد من المخاوف البيئية المتعلقة بالمشروع.\n\nالتاريخ\nنالت منطقة سدوم وعمورة أهمية لاهوتية في كتابات الكثير من الباحثين ما بين الوصف كما في كتابات الرحالة العرب وغيرهم، وإتباع منهجية علمية في الدراسة عند بعض الباحثين ساهمت في تسليط بعض الضوء على حادثة الخسف الشهيرة التي عمت منطقة الحوض الجنوبي للبحر الميت. كما أكد الكثير من العلماء أن مكان الخسف قد تم في مكان الحوض الجنوبي للبحر الميت الحالي، وبأن المدن التي ذكرت في القرآن، والتوراة كانت موجودة في مكان الحوض الجنوبي، وأن الخسف الذي حدث في الألف الثاني قبل الميلاد قد دمّر المدن ومن سكنها. وقد استبعد بعضهم أن البحر الميت قد تكون في تلك الفترة فقد كان موجودا قبل حادثة الخسف. وقد أكدت بعض الدارسات أن البحر الميت قد تشكّل بعد تكون عدة بحيرات سبقت مرحلة البحر الميت الحالي، وأن بعض هذه البحيرات كانت ذات مياه عذبة.\nولقد اتفق العلماء على أن منخفض البحر الميت قد شغله عدة بحيرات سبقت تشكل البحر الميت الحالي وهي بحيرة أصدام، بحيرة السمرة، بحيرة اللسان، وبحيرة دامية، والبحر الميت الحالي.\nفعندما بدأ تشكل منخفض الأغوار، كانت الجبال الشرقية متصلة مع الجبال الغربية. وعندها بدأ منخفض الأغوار بالتشكل بالحركة الأفقية أو العمودية كما أشار العديد من العلماء. ومهما يكن الأمر فقد انفرج منخفض الأغوار على شكل أحواض واسعة لكنها لم تكن عميقة، ويبدو أنه كان متصلا مع البحر المتوسط. ومع توالي عملية الانخفاض انقطع الاتصال ما بين البحر المتوسط ومنخفض البحر الميت. وينقطع بذلك اتصال البحر المتوسط مع الأغوار والذي زوّدها بالمياه فترات زمنية طويلة نسبيا. وأصبح مصدر المياه التي تغذي منطقة الأغوار يعتمد بشكل مباشر على مياه الأمطار.\nوقد تعرضت تلك البحيرات خلال تاريخها الطويل إلى اختلاف من حيث الانخفاض عن مستوى سطح البحر والامتداد الأفقي وملوحة المياه. وكان تعتمد بشكل مباشر على رطوبة الجو ومعدلات الأمطار، حيث كانت تسود المنطقة فترات من الجفاف تليها فترات انتقالية ثم فترات رطبة مما يؤدي إلى جفاف تلك الأجسام المائية أو الامتلاء في الفترات الرطبة. وتشير المصادر الجيولوجية إلى أن بحيرة السمرة نتجت عن فترة رطوبة رافقها ازدياد كبير في معدلات الأمطار وأنها ترافقت مع إحدى العصور الجليدية إلى سادت الأرض وكانت ذات مياه عذبة. أما بحيرة اللسان فقد كانت مياهها عذبة أحيانًا ومالحة في أحيان أخرى حسب رطوبة الجو. وهي أكبر المسطحات المائية التي شغلت منخفض الأغوار حيث وصل طولها إلى 220 كم.\n\nومع نهاية بحيرة اللسان حدثت فترة جفاف قبل 14 ألف سنة، والتي أدت إلى جفاف معظم المسطحات المائية في منطقة الأغوار وهي متطابقة مع آخر عصر جليدي في فترة بحيرة دامية. ومع نهاية بحيرة دامية تشكّل البحر الميت الحالي قبل 11 ألف سنة، وقد كان مستوى سطحه يتعرض إلى تذبذب سببه الظروف الطبيعية الناتجة عن التقلبات المناخية إلى أن تحول التقلب في مستوى سطح البحر الميت إلى عوامل بشرية ناتجة عن تحويل مصادر تغذية البحر الميت بالمياه وأهمها نهر الأردن، وإقامة السدود المائية على الأودية التي ترفد البحر الميت بالمياه حتى انخفضت كمية المياه الواردة إلى البحر الميت من 1200 مليون متر مكعب قبل عام 1960 إلى أقل من 300 مليون متر مكعب في الوقت الراهن.\nوقد وُصف البحر الميت في الكثير من الخرائط والمواقع الدينية اليهودية والمسيحية، حيث تُعد خارطة مادبا الفسيفسائية أهم تلك الخرائط. وهي جزء من أرضية لكنيسة قديمة في مدينة مادبا في الأردن، تعود إلى العصر البيزنطي. وهي أقدم خريطة أصلية للأراضي المقدسة، والتي يعود إنشاؤها إلى سنة 560. توجد اليوم داخل كنيسة القديس جوارجيوس في مدينة مادبا، والتي بُنيت في عام 1896 فوق بقايا الكنيسة البيزنطية. تمتد خريطة مادبا على جزء من أرضية الكنيسة، وتُقدر أبعادها بنحو 15.75 عرضا 5.60 طولا، وتشكل مدينة القدس مركزا لها. وتظهر فيها مواقع في فلسطين والأردن وسوريا ولبنان ومصر.\nوتوجد على شواطئ البحر الميت منطقة تاريخية مهمة، هي خربة قمران، وهي موقع أثري صغير الحجم، يقع على مقربة بضع كيلو مترات جنوبي أريحا في فلسطين. اكتسب شهرته العالمية بسب عثور مخطوطات البحر الميت فيه، وقبل العثور على المخطوطات لم يكن معروفاً إلا عند القليل من علماء الآثار. وكانت أول زيارة للموقع من قبل علماء الآثار في أواخر القرن العشرين. وقد بدأت الحفريات هناك في عام 1950، وكانت عبارة عن تنقيبات تجريبية. وتضم هذه المخطوطات مايزيد على 970 قطعة مخطوطة، بعضها مما سمي لاحقا الكتاب المقدس وبعضها من كُتب لم تكن تعرف أو كانت مفقودة. أول من عثر عليها راعيان من بدو التعامرة المتجولين، كما تم اكتشاف المزيد بين عامي 1947 و1956 في 11 كهفًا في وادي قمران. وقد أثارت المخطوطات اهتمام الباحثين والمختصين بدراسة نص العهد القديم لأنها تعود لما بين القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد والقرن الأول منه.\n\nاستكشاف البحر\nبدأ الاهتمام الغربي باستكشاف نهر الأردن والبحر الميت في أواسط القرن التاسع عشر، وذلك من خلال بعثة أمريكية برئاسة الضابط وليم فرانسيس لنش، الذي زار المنطقة في عام 1848 لأهداف اقتصادية وعلمية ودينية. وتنبع أهمية هذه البعثة من كونها أول بعثة أمريكية ناجحة أرسلت إلى حوض الأردن والبحر الميت، حيث أبدى لنش اهتمامًا واضحًا بالمنطقة، وذلك بدراسة إمكانياتها المائية والمعدنية، كما دعى إلى توطين اليهود في الأردن وفلسطين، قبل أكثر من قرن ونصف.\nلم تكن بعثة لنش البعثة الغربية الأولى إلى منطقة نهر الأردن والبحر الميت، حيث زار الأيرلندي كرستوفر كوستغان وادي الأردن في عام 1835، لكنه مات بعد دخوله البحر الميت. وقبل مجيء لنش بقليل، وتحديداً في عام 1847، زار الإنجليزي توماس مولينكس، من البحرية الملكية البريطانية المنطقة، لاستكشاف البحر الميت، لكنه مات بعد أسبوعين من إتمام مهمته. ويظهر أن لنش كان مدركاً للصعوبات والأخطار التي مر بها سابقوه، لذلك نزل في مدينة عكا على الشاطئ الشمالي لفلسطين في 4 نيسان/ أبريل 1848، حيث أحاط السكان المحليون بالبعثة الأمريكية، وقطع بعدها لنش ورفاقه مسافة 25 ميلاً من شاطئ البحر المتوسط عبر الجليل في خمسة أيام.\n\nبدأ لنش رحلته من بحيرة طبريا عبر نهر الأردن إلى البحر الميت. حيث استغرقت الرحلة ثلاثة شهور (نيسان - حزيران 1848). وبعد وصول لنش للبحر الميت في نيسان 1848، أثّرت طبيعة التربة ومنظرها العام في نفسه سلبًا، على الاهتمامات المستقبية للمنطقة، فالملح الخارج عن البحر الميت مغطيًا الحجارة، وطبيعة النباتات في المنطقة تشكّل نقاطاً لتساؤلات مفيدة. كما رأى أن المساحات المحيطة بوادي الأردن وخاصة على الجانب الشرقي منه كانت جافة وصلبة. وخلال جولة لنش في البحر الميت التي استمرت ثلاثة أسابيع رسم بعض الخرائط لشواطئ البحر، واستكشف المرتفعات المحيطة به.\nمن جانب آخر، اكتشف العلماء مؤخرًا العشرات من ينابيع المياه العذبة على طول ساحل البحر الميت وعلى عمق من 30 - 100 قدم تحت قعر البحر. أهمية هذا الاكتشاف تنبع في فهم أكثر للتوازن البيئي للبحر الميت. وقد وجد العلماء العديد من الحفر كل منها بعرض حوالي 10 أمتار في الجزء السفلي للبحيرة، وهي مغطاة بطبقة رقيقة وغريبة من أنواع بكتيرية جديدة.\n\nأهمية دينية\nارتبط البحر الميت تاريخيّا بقصة قوم لوط التي ذُكرت كثيرًا في الكتب السماوية. ولوط هو ابن أخ النبي إبراهيم. هاجر لوط وإبراهيم من العراق إلى الشام في القرن التاسع عشر قبل الميلاد. وقوم لوط هم من أصل عربي قحطاني أصولهم تعود إلى الجزيرة العربية، سكنوا منطقة جنوب البحر الميت بعد الهجرة العربية الأولى التي خرجت من الجزيرة العربية باتجاه الشمال، وتحديدًا بلاد الشام.\nوكان هؤلاء القوم معروفين بممارسة اللواط. وقد ذكرت الكتب السماوية قصتهم بعد أن سئم لوط منهم ويئس من هدايتهم، فتعرضوا لعذاب أدى إلى تدمير قراهم الخمس عن بكرة أبيها. ووردت قصتهم في القرآن سبعة وعشرين مرة في 14 سورة مختلفة.\nولقد ورد البحر الميت في الإنجيل تحت مُسمّيات مختلفة مثل «بحر الملح» و«بحر العربة» و«البحر الشرقي» وغيرها. كما وردت قصة لوط في التوراة في عدة مواضع من سفر التكوين.\n\nالحياة البرية\nتتميز مناطق غور الأردن (من بحيرة الحولة جنوباً إلى جنوب البحر الميت) عن غيرها بالمناخ شبه المداري وقلة حدوث الصقيع، مما يسمح لنباتات استوائية وشبه استوائية بالنمو. أُدخلت نباتات مثل النخيل والموز والحمضيات. من أمثلة النباتات البرية في هذه المناطق الغاب العملاق في مناطق المجاري المائية والوديان. تتميز منطقة النقب ببعض الأنواع التي تعد امتداداً للغطاء النباتي في إفريقيا. من هذه الأنواع العشار الباسق (باللاتينية: Calotropis procera) وأربعة أنواع من السنط أحدها السنط الملتوي (باللاتينية: Acacia tortilis). وتشتهر منطقة البحر الميت باحتوائها على نمط النباتات الملحي، والذي ينتشر أيضًا حول واحات الأزرق، وغور الأردن. وتختلف نباتات هذه المناطق باختلاف درجة ملوحتها وبالتالي قدرة النبات على تحمل الملوحة. ومن نباتات هذا النمط الغرقد والأثل. كما تحوي المنطقة على نمط الغابات الاستوائي، ومعظم الغطاء النباتي في هذا النمط قد تعرض للتدمير بسبب انتشار الزراعة المكثف. وتعتبر نباتات السدر والطلح من أهم نباتات هذا النمط.\n\nكذلك، توجد أجناس نباتية تتواجد في معظم البيئات الشامية المذكورة أعلاه مثل السوسن الذي ينتشر منه أكثر من ثلاثين نوعًا تتوزع على مختلف مناطق الشام حسب تأقلم كل نوع منها. كذلك ينتشر أكثر من خمسين نوعًا من جنس الثوم (الفصيلة الثومية) وأربعين من القنطريون (الفصيلة النجمية) في مناطق الشام المختلفة من مرعش إلى سيناء. هناك أيضًا أكثر من ستين نوعًا من جنس السيلينة من الفصيلة القرنفلية تنتشر في مختلف المناطق وسبعة وثلاثون نوعا من الأربيان من الفصيلة النجمية. وينتشر أيضًا في هذه المنطقة نبات قتاد البحر الميت، وهو نوع نباتي عشبي من جنس القتاد.\nويقع على الجانبين الشرقي والغربي من البحر الميت عدد من المحميات الطبيعية التي تحوي تنوعًا كبيرًا في الكائنات الحية المختلفة. وتُعد محمية الموجب الممتدة بين محافظة مادبا ومحافظة الكرك في الأردن من أهم تلك المحميات، حيث يعيش فيها العديد من الحيوانات البرية مثل الماعز الجبلي وهو نوع من الماعز، الغزال الجبلي، الذئب، الوبر، والضبع المخططة، والقطط البرية مثل الوشق النادر الوجود في الأردن والنموس وغيرها. كما توجد في المحمية أنواع كثيرة من الطيور بلغ عدد أنواعها أكثر من 150 من بين المحلية والمهاجرة منها الشنار والسفرج والقبرة المتوجة والأبلق الحزين والسوادية والبلبل والغراب المروحي الذنب مثل الرخمة المصرية، وعقاب البادية والعويسق وعقاب بونيللي.\n\nالسكان\nتشير المصادر التاريخية، إلى أن تاريخ الاستيطان البشري في منطقة البحر الميت وتحديدًا الجزء الجنوبي منه يمتد إلى الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد. حيث كان مركزا حضاريًا في الفترة التاريخية من 3300 ق.م إلى 2300 ق م. وقد اُستدل على ذلك من خلال الحفريات التي اُجريت في منطقة غور المزرعة، وتحديدًا باب الذراع، حيث عُثر هنالك على أكبر مقبرة في الشرق القديم والتي يعود تاريخها إلى أقدم من خمسة آلاف عام في العصر البرونزي المبكر. وفي الألف الثاني قبل الميلاد، وتحديدًا في 1900 ق. م. كانت منطقة الحوض الجنوبي تعج بالحضارة، وهي الفترة ذاتها التي عاش فيها لوط حسب معظم المصادر التاريخية. وكان فيها خمسة مدن مزدهرة هي: سدوم، عمورة، زغر، أدمة، وصوبيم. وشهدت في تلك المرحلة خسف ودمار لتلك الحضارات. وقد تم الاستشهاد بما نزل من آيات القرآن، وبعض الكتب المقدسة وأراء الكثير من المفسرين وربط ذلك مع التاريخ الجيولوجي لمنطقة البحر الميت.\nالمجتمع المحلي\n\nيعيش اليوم على الجانب الشرقي من البحر الميت حوالي 70,000 نسمة، يتركز معظمهم في بلدات فيفا وغور الصافي ومدينة البوتاس والكفرين. بالإضافة إلى الآلاف من الذين يعملون في الصناعة والسياحة في محافظتي الكرك ومادبا. يوجد في منطقة غور الصافي نشاط زراعي واسع، حيث يجذب بعض العمالة. ويتركز النشاط السياحي في الجزء الشمالي الشرقي حيث تتركز الفنادق الأردنية. ويعمل في هذا القطاع حوالي 20 ٪ من المشتغلين في تلك المنطقة. كما توظف المصانع الكيماوية حوالي 20 ٪ منهم، أما الباقي فيعمل في قطاع الخدمات. وتخضع المنطقة الشرقية للبحر الميت لسلطة وادي الأردن.\nويشكل لواء الأغوار الجنوبية التابع لمحافظة الكرك الأردنية جزءاً كبيرًا من هذه المنطقة، والذي يتجاوز عدد سكانه المقيمين إقامة دائمة 49,000 نسمة حسب إحصائيات دائرة الأحوال المدنية والجوازاتفي الأردن للعام 2008. وهم يعتمدون على الزراعة بالدرجة الأولى بحكم الطبيعة الجغرافية للمنطقة. ويُقدر عدد العاملين في هذا القطاع بحوالي 60% من السكان ذكورًا وإناثًا. وتعد الصافي من أكبر التجمعات السكانية.\nأما على الجانب الغربي، فيعيش في المنطقة الشمالية الغربية، وتحديدًا بالقرب من أريحا وضواحيها 25,000 نسمة. ويعمل سكان هذه المنطقة بشكل أساسي في الزراعة والخدمات. كما يوجد عدد من المستوطنات الإسرائيلية على هذا الجانب يسكنها حوالي 2,500 نسمة، وتديرها المجالس الإقليمية المحلية، ويبلغ عدد هذه المستوطنات 12 مستوطن وتجمع سكني. هذا بالإضافة إلى البدو الذين يأتون في كل يوم لمنطقة أريحا من عراد والقدس وديمونة وبئر السبع. تشغل السياحة الجزء الأكبر من عمل الموظفين في الجزء الغربي من البحر الميت، حيث يعمل فيها حوالي 5,000 موظف. أما الباقي، فيعملون في الزراعة والخدمات.\n\nالاقتصاد\nبدأ البحر الميت في بدايات القرن العشرين بجذب اهتمام الكيميائيين الذين استنتجوا بدورهم أن البحر يحوي ثروات طبيعية مهولة من البوتاس (كلوريد البوتاسيوم) والبروم. لذا، قامت شركة البوتاس الفلسطينية في عام 1929 بتأسيس أول مصنع ينتج البوتاس في الساحل الشمالي للبحر الميت، حيث كان الإنتاج يتم عبر التبخير الشمسي في المحاليل المائية. وكان يعمل في المصنع عمّال عرب ويهود، حيث كان كواحة سلام في أوقات عصيبة. وفي عام 1934 قامت الشركة بتأسيس مصنعها الثاني في الساحل الجنوبي قرب جبل سدوم، إلا أنها تضررت كثيرًا بفعل أحداث النكبة عام 1948.\nتم إغلاق المصنع الواقع في شمال البحر الميت في الضفة الغربية بعد حرب 1948، وقد تم تفكيكه من قبل عصابة البالماخ الصهيونية قبل انسحابها. كما تمت إعادة تشغيل العمليات في مصنع سدوم بالجنوب في عام 1952، والذي استمر حتى وقتنا الحاضر. لقد استولت إسرائيل على بقايا شركة البوتاس الفلسطينية المحدودة بعد تأسيسها، وقد تم تاسيس شركة أخرى بدلاً عنها مملوكة للدولة في عام 1952 لاستخراج البوتاس وغيره من المعادن من البحر الميت. وقد تمت خصخصة الشركة في عام 1995، وهي مملوكة حاليًا لشركة كيماويات إسرائيل.\nيمتد الساحل الفلسطيني على البحر الميت في الضفة الغربية بحوالي 40 كم، إلا أن الاقتصاد الفلسطيني لا يستفيد من الصناعات الكيماوية في البحر الميت بسبب إجراءات الاحتلال الإسرائيلي والمناطق المغلقة التي فرضتها إسرائيل بعد احتلالها للضفة الغربية عام 1967. وتشير تقديرات البنك الدولي إلى أن صناعة المواد الكيميائية الفلسطينية من البحر الميت يمكن أن تولد 918 مليون دولار للقيمة المضافة سنويًا، أي ما يعادل تقريبا كل مساهمة قطاع الصناعات التحويلية في الأراضي الفلسطينية اليوم. كما تشير تقديرات البنك الدولي إلى أن صناعة السياحة الفلسطينية بالبحر الميت يمكن أن تولد 290 مليون دولار من العائدات سنوياً و2900 فرصة عمل. ومع ذلك، فإن الفلسطينيون لا يستطيعون الحصول على تصاريح البناء للاستثمارات ذات الصلة بالسياحة على البحر الميت بسب إجراءات الاحتلال الإسرائيلي. ويُعتبر البحر الميت ذخرًا إستراتيجيًا للاقتصاد الفلسطيني، لما يحتويه على كميات من الأملاح والمعادن ذات القيمة العالية، والتي تستولي عليها إسرائيل باستخراجها وبيعها، وتمنع أي نشاط اقتصادي فلسطيني في تلك المنطقة. وتُقدر الخسائر السنوية للاقتصاد الفلسطيني نتيجة عدم استغلاله لموارد البحر الميت بنحو 1.1 مليار دولار أي ما يعادل 13.6% من الناتج المحلي الإجمالي.\n\nأما على الجانب الأردني من البحر الميت، فقد تم تأسيس شركة البوتاس العربية في عام 1956، والتي تنتج حوالي مليوني طن من البوتاس سنويًا، بالإضافة إلى كلوريد الصوديوم والبرومين. يقع المصنع في غور الصافي، في لواء الأغوار الجنوبية بمحافظة الكرك. ويجني الأردن من الصناعات المعدنية في البحر الميت حوالي 1.2 مليار دولار (تعدال 4% من الدخل القومي للمملكة). ويقع على الشاطئ الأردني حوالي 5 فنادق كبرى مصنفة كخمسة أو أربعة نجوم، أدخلت عوائد للمملكة في عام 2012 بحوالي 128 مليون دولار. وقد زار بانوراما البحر الميت 12 ألف زائر في عام 2013.\nوقد بدأ الأردن بإنشاء منطقة البحر الميت التنموية على بعد 55 كم من العاصمة عمّان لتقديم الفرص الاستثمارية لتطوير العقارات. تمتد المنطقة على حوالي 40 كم مربع على شواطئ الساحلين الشمالي والشرقي للبحر الميت، وتحيط بها الجبال والتضاريس المنحدرة إلى شرق وادي نهر الأردن إلى الشمال. تتمتع المنطقة ببنى تحتية جيدة، وتتصل مع عمّان من خلال الطريق السريع الرئيسي إضافة إلى أماكن الجذب السياحي. وتتركز الفرص الاستثمارية في قطاع السياحة والفندقة بتطوير فنادق دولية من فئة خدمات أربع وخمس نجوم، وتطوير فنادق من فئة 3 نجوم، والمرافق والمنشآت البيئية والمجمعات السكنية والخدمات المجتمعية والمرافق الترفيهية والمنتجعات والمطاعم ومراكز المؤتمرات والمعارض.\nأما بالنسبة لإسرائيل، فقد أنتجت من المحلول الملحي للبحر الميت في عام 2001، حوالي 1,7 مليون طن من البوتاس، وحوالي 206,000 طن من البرومين، و44,900 طن من الصودا الكاوية، وحوالي 25,000 طن من معادن المغنيسيوم، وكلوريد الصوديوم. وتجني الشركات الإسرائيلية حوالي 3 مليارات دولار سنوياً من بيع معادن البحر الميت (في المقام الأول البوتاس والبروم) وغيرها من المنتجات المستمدة من معادن البحر الميت. وتملك إسرائيل 15 فندقًا على طول ساحل البحر الميت الغربي. وكان لهذه الفنادق عوائد على الاقتصاد الإسرائيلي بلغت في عام 2012 حوالي 291 مليون دولار. معظم تلك الفنادق توجد في الجزء الجنوبي من الساحل الغربي.\n\nالسياحة\nتُعد منطقة البحر الميت من أهم المناطق السياحية للاستشفاء البيئي على مستوى العالم، حيث تتميز بمجموعة من العوامل الطبيعية ما جعلها تحظى بمركز تنافسي في المنطقة في مجال السياحة العلاجية والاستشفاء نظرًا لما يتمتع به من خصائص مناخية فريدة سواءً بخلوّه من الرطوبة، وباحتوائه على عيون كبريتية جعلته مؤهلاً لعلاج العديد من الأمراض وخاصة الجلدية منها، والتي تنتشر بصورة كبيرة، حيث يصل عدد المصابين بها في أوروبا إلى 25 مليون مريض، إضافةً إلى علاج الروماتويد، وبذلك امتلكت منطقة البحر الميت عناصر مهمة للجذب السياحي ليس فقط في سياحة الاستشفاء، ولكن بتميزه أيضًا في سياحة الترفيه والسياحة البيئية. إن اختيار منطقة البحر الميت من خلال منظمة الصحة العالمية كمركز عالمي لعلاج الكثير من الأمراض الجلدية في عام 2011، يدل على أهمية المنطقة في مجال السياحة العلاجية. وتعتمد العديد من الفنادق المقامة على ساحل البحر الميت على تقديم العلاج الطبيعي القائم على الاستفادة من الخصائص الطبيعية المميزة للمنطقة دون استخدام أي أدوية كيماوية على الإطلاق. وتؤكد العديد من الدراسات أن منطقة البحر الميت بامتلاكها هذه المزايا العلاجية يمكنها تحقيق أكبر عائد مادي سياحي للأردن، حيث أن نسبة الإصابة بالأمراض الجلدية يتراوح ما بين 1 : 3% من تعداد السكان.\nكما شهدت سياحة المؤتمرات في البحر الميت تطورًا ملحوظًا خلال الآونة الأخيرة، وأصبحت منطقة البحر الميت تختص بهذا النوع من السياحة، من خلال تنظيم المؤتمرات والندوات واللقاءات على كافة المستويات المحلية والإقليمية والعالمية، حيث تتولى جهات مختصة مهمة تنظيم هذه اللقاءات والمؤتمرات وتوفير خدمات لا تقتصر على الجانب الرسمي للمؤتمر، وإنما تشتمل أيضًا على تقديم الخدمات السياحية والترفيهية للمشاركين. وقد قام الأردن بتأسيس شركة البحر الميت للمؤتمرات والمعارض في عام 2003 بمشاركة مجموعة من المستثمرين الأردنيين والعرب. فكانت باكورة مشاريع هذه الشركة هو إنشاء مركز الملك الحسين بن طلال للمؤتمرات لاستضافة أهم الفعاليات والمؤتمرات الإقليمية والعالمية. ولقد ساهم هذا المشروع في وضع الأردن على الخارطة العالمية لملتقيات رجال الأعمال والاستثمار، حيث استضاف المركز المنتدى الاقتصادي العالمي لأكثر من مرة.\nوينظّم الأردن سنويًا ماراثوناً للركض في البحر الميت بمشاركة الآلاف من المواطنين والسيّاح انطلاقا من عمّان وانتهاءً بشاطئ عمّان السياحي المطل على البحر الميت. ويُقام هذا الحدث لدعم مرضى الدماغ والأعصاب في المملكة.\n\nكما تنتج مختبرات البحر الميت الكثير من مستحضرات التجميل المصنوعة من المعادن المستخرجة من طينه، حيث تتوفر في الأسواق في أنحاء الأردن، أو يمكن طلبها عبر شبكة الإنترنت فيتم تسليمها إلى أي مكان في العالم، لكي يتمكن الزوار من الاستمرار بالتمتع بفوائد البحر الميت، بعد عودتهم إلى ديارهم بفترة طويلة.\nمن جهة أخرى، خصصت الحكومة الإسرائيلية في 2012 مبلغ 220 مليون دولار لما أسمته «تطوير وتأهيل البحر الميت». وستغطي معظم الموازنة تطوير المنطقتين السياحيتين على البحر الميت والمسماتين «تامي زوهر» و«عين بوقيق» وما بينهما، فضلا عن تأهيل ومعالجة المناطق والبنى التحتية التي تضررت أو التي يخيم عليها الخطر. وعند إنجاز المشروع، تتوقع الحكومة الإسرائيلية أن يرتفع عدد الغرف الفندقية المعروضة من 4000 إلى 6500. ويهدف المشروع الإسرائيلي، بشكل أساسي، إلى تحويل البحر الميت إلى أحد المواقع السياحية الرائدة في العالم؛ وهو لا يمس من قريب أو بعيد مشكلة استنزاف المصانع الإسرائيلية للموارد الملحية الطبيعية في البحر، علما بأن المصانع الإسرائيلية تستنزف سنويًا أكثر من 250 مليون متر مكعب من مياه البحر الميت.\n\nفي الثقافة الإنسانية\nعُرف البحر الميت في الكثير من ثقافات وحضارات شعوب المنطقة. وكان الفراعنة أول من التفت إلى أهميته، وتحديدًا الملكة كليوباترا، فهي أول من اكتشف أملاحه وخصائصه الشفائية والعلاجية للبشرة وشدّ العظام والجلد وتنشيط الدورة الدموية ومقاومة التجاعيد. كما كان حمام الطين أحد وصفاتها للجمال، حيث كانت تصنع ذلك الحمام من الطين المأخوذ من البحر الميت، والذي اشتهر باحتوائه بوفرة على المعادن التي تغذي البشرة وتنشطها وتسهم في نعومتها وبريقها.\n\nوقد وُصف البحر الميت في الكثير من اللوحات الفنية العالمية، كلوحة الفنان المجري تيفادار أثناء زيارته لفلسطين عام 1906، حيث ظهرت فيها مدينة القدس ومن خلفها البحر الميت. كما ذُكر البحر في عدد من الأعمال الأدبية، سواءً المحلية أو العالمية. وتُعد قصيدة «حجر كنعاني في البحر الميت» للشاعر الفلسطيني محمود درويش أحد أهم تلك الأعمال الأدبية. من جهة أخرى، تُعد «قصائد البحر الميت» التي كتبها الشاعر الإنجليزي سيمون آرميتاج من الأعمال الأدبية الغربية المهمة في هذا الخصوص. وقد استوحاها من النتائج التي توصل إليها علماء الآثار من مخطوطات البحر الميت، والتي اكتشفها راعي ماعز في عام 1947، كما عكست تجارب الشاعر وتجذرها في حياته الخاصة. وتتكون القصيدة من 11 موشحة، معظمها يتكون من 3 أسطر، ويتكون المقطع الشعري الأخير من مجرد نصف سطر.\n\nانظر أيضًا\nقائمة أماكن حسب انخفاضها تحت مستوى البحر\nالبحيرة المالحة الكبرى\nبحيرة طبريا\nبحيرة الحولة\nبحيرة عسل\nاكتوبوس

      "summary": "البحر الميت هو بحيرة ملحية مغلقة تقع في أخدود وادي الأردن ضمن الشق السوري الأفريقي، على خط الحدود الفاصل بين الأردن وفلسطين التاريخية (الضفة الغربية والداخل المحتل). يشتهر البحر الميت بأنه أخفض نقطة على سطح الكرة الأرضية، حيث بلغ منسوب شاطئه حوالي 400 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر حسب سجلات عام 2013. كما يتميز البحر الميت بشدة ملوحته، إذ تبلغ نسبة الأملاح فيه حوالي 34%، وهي ما تمثل تسعة أضعاف تركيز الأملاح في البحر المتوسط، وواحدة من أعلى نسب الملوحة بالمسطحات المائية في العالم. وقد نتجت هذه الأملاح لأن البحيرة هي وجهة نهائية للمياه التي تصب فيه، حيث أنه لا يوجد أي مخرج لها بعده.\nيصل عرض البحر الميت في أقصى حد إلى 17 كم، بينما يبلغ طوله حوالي 70 كم. وقد بلغت مساحته في عام 2010 حوالي 650 كم2 إذ تقلصت خلال الأربع عقود الماضية بما يزيد عن 35%. كما يلعب المناخ الصحراوي للمنطقة الذي يمتاز بشدة الحرارة والجفاف ومعدلات التبخر العالية دورًا كبيرًا في زيادة تركيز تلك الأملاح فيه.\nلقد عانى منسوب البحر الميت مؤخرًا من التراجع المستمر، حيث يرجع هذا الأمر إلى عدد من الأسباب الرئيسية، كالاستخدام المكثف لمصادر المياه، وأهمها نهر الأردن، وضخ المياه في الحوض الجنوبي، حيث يتكون البحر الميت حاليًا من حوضين؛ شمالي وجنوبي يقسمهما شبه جزيرة اللسان. ونتيجة للانخفاض المستمر لهذا المستوى، تعرض الجزء الجنوبي من البحيرة للجفاف، حيث إنّ الجزء الجنوبي أقل عمقًا من نظيره الشمالي، ويصل ارتفاع منسوب شاطئه إلى 401 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر. ومع تجفيف الجزء الجنوبي، تم إنشاء برك لتبخير المياه وإنتاج البوتاس والمواد الكيماوية الأخرى مثل المنجنيز والمغنسيوم والبرومين في مصانع البوتاس الإسرائيلية، وشركة البوتاس العربية في الأردن. وتحتاج تلك البرك إلى ضخ كبير من مياه البحر الميت وتبخيرها، مما أثّر تأثيرًا كبيرًا على زيادة انخفاض مستوى سطح البحر.\nلقد بلغ المعدل السنوي لانخفاض مستوى سطح البحر خلال العقد المنصرم بمقدار يعادل الفقدان لمدة سنة كاملة، حيث أصبح المستوى ينخفض حوالي متر واحد كل عام. ولقد زاد هذا المعدل في عام 2012 بشكل واضح، فكان انخفاض مستوى البحر 1.40 متر. وقد أدى الانخفاض التراكمي في مستوى المياه إلى تغيرات كبيرة أيضا في تضاريس المناطق المجاورة وفي البحر الأبيض المتوسط بما في ذلك تغيرات لا يمكن الرجوع عنها في الجزء الشمالي، من خلق للمجاري، والانسحاب من الشواطئ، والأضرار التي لحقت بالبنية التحتية (الطرق والجسور) والمحميات الطبيعية.\nيُعد البحر الميت مهماً جدًا للصناعة والسياحة في المنطقة، حيث تُعتبر تركيبة مياهه مختلفة عن المياه الطبيعية، باحتوائها على تركيز عالي من الكالسيوم والبوتاسيوم. ويُستغل هذا في مصانع الجانبين الأردني والإسرائيلي. وترجع الأهمية التاريخية والسياحية لمنطقة حوض البحر الميت إلى البحر نفسه وإلى شواطئه، حيث توجد بعض المعالم الأثرية والدينية الهامة في المنطقة مثل مسعدة، وخربة قمران، وكهف النبي لوط، بالإضافة إلى التشكيلات الملحية الطبيعية، والمناخ السائد فيه، فكلها جعلت من البحر الميت نقطة جذب سياحية عالمية، وخصوصًا فيما يتعلق بالسياحة العلاجية. وتحوي المنطقة على آلاف الغرف الفندقية، حيث تتركز في الجزء الشمالي الشرقي في الأردن، بالإضافة إلى الجزء الغربي المطل على الحوض الجنوبي. وقد رُشح ليكون أحد عجائب الدنيا السبع الطبيعية في نطاق البحيرات.\nورغم أن دولة فلسطين لها جزء يطل على البحر الميت إلا أن السلطات الإسرائيلية لا تسمح للفلسطينيين باستغلال مواردهم من البحر، بل تمنعهم تماما من الذهاب إلى ساحل البحر الميت بحجة الأمن. وتشكل حقوق الفلسطينيين في استغلال نصيبهم من البحر الميت نقطة هامة في مباحثات السلام، بالإضافة إلى حقوقهم في مياه الشرب.",
