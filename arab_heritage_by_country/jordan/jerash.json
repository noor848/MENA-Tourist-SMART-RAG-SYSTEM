      "content": "Jerash or Jarash (Arabic: جرش, romanized: Ǧaraš, Arabic pronunciation: [dʒa.raʃ]; Greek: Γέρασα, romanized: Gérasa, Attic Greek pronunciation: [ɡérasa], Koine Greek pronunciation: [ˈɡerasa]) is a city in northern Jordan. The city is the administrative center of the Jerash Governorate, and has a population of 50,745 as of 2015. It is located 30.0 miles (48.3 kms) north of the capital city Amman.\nThe earliest evidence of settlement in Jerash is in a Neolithic site known as Tal Abu Sowan, where rare human remains dating to around 7500 BC were uncovered. Jerash flourished during the Greek, Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine periods, when it was known as Gerasa. It was one of the cities of the Hellenistic cities of the Decapolis. It was an important city in early Christian times and its early churches, some of which were formerly temples, include notable examples of the evolution of church architecture. In the mid-eighth century the 749 Galilee earthquake destroyed large parts of it, and subsequent earthquakes contributed to additional destruction.\nIn 1120, Zahir ad-Din Toghtekin, atabeg of Damascus ordered a garrison of forty men to build up a fort in an unknown site of the ruins of the ancient city, likely the highest spot of the city walls in the north-eastern hills. It was captured in 1121 by Baldwin II, King of Jerusalem, and utterly destroyed. The Crusaders immediately abandoned Jerash and withdrew to Sakib (Seecip); the eastern border of the settlement.\nJerash was then deserted and reappeared in the historical record at the beginning of Ottoman rule in the area during the early 16th century. In the census of 1596, it had a population of 12 Muslim households. However, archaeologists found a small Mamluk hamlet in the Northwest Quarter which indicates that Jerash was resettled before the Ottoman era. The excavations conducted since 2011 have shed light on the Middle Islamic period as recent discoveries have uncovered a large concentration of Middle Islamic/Mamluk structures and pottery. The ancient city has been gradually revealed through a series of excavations since 1925.\nJerash today is home to one of the best preserved Greco-Roman cities, which earned it the nickname \"Pompeii of the Middle East\". Approximately 330,000 visitors arrived in Jerash in 2018, making it one of the most visited sites in Jordan. The city hosts the Jerash Festival, one of the leading cultural events in the Middle East that attracts tens of thousands of visitors every year.\n\nHistory\nNeolithic age\nArchaeologists have found ruins of settlements dating back to the Neolithic Age. Moreover, in August 2015, an archaeological excavation team from the University of Jordan unearthed two human skulls that date back to the Neolithic period (7500–5500 BC) at a site in Jerash. This forms solid evidence of inhabitance of Jordan in that period, especially in connection with the existence of 'Ain Ghazal Neolithic settlement in Amman. The importance of the discovery lies in the rarity of the skulls, as archaeologists estimate that a maximum of 12 sites across the world contain similar human remains.\n\nBronze Age\nEvidence of settlements dating to the Bronze Age (3200–1200 BC) have been found in the region.\n\nHellenistic period\nJerash is the site of the ruins of the Greek city of Gerasa, also referred to as Antioch on the Golden River. Ancient Greek inscriptions from the city support that the city was founded by Alexander the Great and his general Perdiccas, who allegedly settled aged Macedonian soldiers there during the spring of 331 BC, when he left Egypt and crossed Syria en route to Mesopotamia. However, other sources, namely the city's former name of \"Antioch on the Chrysorrhoas,\" point to a founding by Seleucid King Antioch IV, while still others attribute the founding to Ptolemy II of Egypt.\nIn the early 80s BC Hasmonean King Alexander Jannaeus besieged and conquered Gerasa, incorporating it into the Kingdom of Judea. Archeological findings indicate that public buildings in Gerasa may have been destroyed during that period.\n\nRoman period\nWith the Roman conquest of the area in 63 BC, the short-lived Jewish rule of Gerasa came to an end. Pompey attached the city to the Decapolis, a league of Hellenistic cities that enjoyed considerable autonomy under Roman protection. The historian Josephus mentions the city as being principally inhabited by Syrians, and also having a small Jewish community. During the First Jewish–Roman War, Gerasa was among the few non-Jewish cities in the region not to kill or imprison its Jewish residents, and its residents even escorted any Jews who wanted to leave to the border. \nGerasa was the birthplace of the mathematician Nicomachus of Gerasa (Greek: Νικόμαχος) (c. 60 – c. 120 AD). It has been proposed to identify it as Geresh, a place mentioned by Josephus as the birthplace of Jewish Zealot leader Simon bar Giora, but other scholars identify it with modern-day Jurish.\nIn the second half of the 1st century AD, the city of Gerasa achieved great prosperity. In AD 106, Geras was absorbed into the Roman province of Arabia, which included the cities of Philadelphia (modern day Amman), Petra and Bostra. The Romans ensured security and peace in this area, which enabled its people to devote their efforts and time to economic development and encouraged civic building activity. Emperor Trajan constructed roads throughout the province, and more trade came to Jerash. Emperor Hadrian visited Gerasa in AD 129–130, and the triumphal arch known as the Arch of Hadrian was built to celebrate this occasion.\n\nByzantine period\nThe city finally reached a size of about 80 ha (200 acres) within its walls. Beneath the foundations of a Byzantine church built in Gerasa in AD 530  a mosaic floor was discovered with ancient Greek and Hebrew-Aramaic inscriptions. The presence of the Hebrew-Aramaic script has led scholars to suggest that the place was a synagogue converted into a church. Gerasa was invaded by the Persian Sassanids in AD 614. In 636, the Byzantine army was defeated in the Battle of the Yarmuk by the invading Muslim forces and these territories became part of the Rashidun Caliphate.\n\nUmayyad period\nThe city flourished during the Umayyad Caliphate. It had numerous shops and issued coins with the mint named \"Jerash\" in Arabic. It was also a centre for ceramic manufacture; molded ceramic lamps had Arabic inscriptions that showed the potter's name and Jerash as the place of manufacture. The large mosque and several churches that continued to be used as places of worship, indicated that during the Umayyad period Jerash had a sizable Muslim community that co-existed with the Christians. In 749, a devastating earthquake destroyed much of Jerash and its surroundings.\n\nCrusader period\nIn the early 12th century a fortress was built by a garrison stationed in the area by the Zahir ad-Din Toghtekin, atabeg of Damascus. Baldwin II, King of Jerusalem, captured and burned the fortress in 1121–1122. Although the site of the fortification has often been identified with the ruins of the temple of Artemis, there is no evidence of the construction of a fortification in the temple in the 12th century. The location of this fort is probably to be found at the highest point of the city walls, in the north-eastern hills.\n\nMid to Late Muslim period\nSmall settlements continued in Jerash during the Mamluk Sultanate, and Ottoman periods. This occurred particularly in the Northwest Quarter and around the Temple of Zeus, where several Islamic Mamluk domestic structures have now been excavated.\nIn 1596, during the Ottoman era, Jerash was noted in the  census as Jaras, being located  in the nahiya of Bani Ilwan in the liwa of  Ajloun. It had a population of 12 Muslim households.  They paid a fixed tax-rate of 25%  on various  agricultural products, including wheat, barley, olive trees/fruit trees, goats and beehives, in addition to  occasional revenues and a press for olive oil/grape syrup; a total of  6,000 akçe.\nIn 1838 Jerash was described as a ruin.\n\nClimate\nJerash has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa).\n\nArchaeology\nJerash is considered one of the largest and most well-preserved sites of Greek and Roman architecture in the world outside Italy.\n\nGreco-Roman period\nRemains in the Greco-Roman Gerasa include:\n\nOval forum 300 feet long surrounded by an Ionic colonnade\nTwo large sanctuaries dedicated to Artemis and Zeus with well preserved temples\nTwo theatres (the South Theatre and the North Theatre)\nThe long colonnaded street or cardo and its side streets or decumani\nTwo tetrapyla of Jerash, one at the intersection of northern-decumanus and cardo maximus and the other at the intersection of southern-Decumanus and cardo maximus\nArch of Hadrian\nThe circus / hippodrome\nTwo major thermae (communal baths complexes)\nA large nymphaeum fed by an aqueduct\nA macellum or porticoed market\nA trapezoidal plaza delimited by two open-exedra buildings\nAn almost complete circuit of city walls\nTwo large bridges across the nearby river\nAn extramural sanctuary with large pools and a small theatre.\nMost of these monuments were built by donations of the city's wealthy citizens. The south theatre has a focus in the center of the pit in front of the stage, marked by a distinct stone, and from which normal speaking can be heard easily throughout the auditorium. In 2018, at least 14 marble sculptures were discovered in the excavation of the Eastern Baths of Gerasa, including images of Aphrodite and Zeus.\n\nLate Roman and Early Byzantine period\nA large Christian community lived in Jerash. A large cathedral was built in the city in the 4th century, the first of at least 14 churches built between the 4th and the 7th-century, many with superb mosaic floors. The supposed sawmill of Gerasa is well described in the Visitors Centre. The use of water power to saw wood or stone is well known in the Roman world: the invention occurred in the 3rd century BC. They converted the rotary movement from the mill into a linear motion using a crankshaft; good examples are known also from Hierapolis and Ephesus.\n\nArchaeological museums\nThe archaeological site of Jerash has two museums in which are displayed archaeological materials and corresponding information about the site and its rich history. The Jerash Archaeological Museum, which is the older of the two museums, is found on top of the mound known as \"Camp Hill\" just east of the Cardo and overlooking the Oval Plaza. The small museum contains a chronological display of artifacts found in and around Jerash from prehistoric to Islamic times. The museum displays a unique group of small statues of a group identified as the Muses of the Olympic pantheon which were discovered at Jerash in 2016. The statues, which are Roman in date, were found in a fragmentary condition and have been partially restored. The museum also contains a well-preserved lead sarcophagus dated to the late 4th to 5th centuries and features Christian and pagan symbolism. The museum also has a number of sculptures, altars, and mosaics displayed outside. \n\nThe Jerash Visitor Center serves as a more recent archaeological museum, and presents the site of Jerash in a thematic approach with a focus on the evolution and development of the city of Jerash over time, as well as economy, technology, religion, and daily life. The center also displays further sculptures discovered in Jerash in 2016, including restored statues of Zeus and Aphrodite, as well as a marble head thought to represent the Roman Empress Julia Domna.\n\nModern Jerash\nJerash has developed dramatically in the last century with the growing importance of the tourism industry in the city. Jerash is now the second-most popular tourist attraction in Jordan, closely behind the ruins of Petra. On the western side of the city, which contained most of the representative buildings, the ruins have been carefully preserved and spared from encroachment, with the modern city sprawling to the east of the river which once divided ancient Jerash in two.\n\nDemographics\nJerash has an ethnically diverse population. The vast majority are Arabs, though the population includes small numbers of Kurds, Circassians and Armenians. \nJerash became a destination for many successive waves of foreign migrants. In 1885, the Ottoman authorities directed the Circassian immigrants who were mainly of peasant stock to settle in Jerash, and distributed arable land among them. The new immigrants have been welcomed by the local people. Later, Jerash also witnessed waves of Palestinian refugees who flowed to the region in 1948 and 1967. The Palestinian refugees settled in two camps; Souf camp near the town of Souf and Gaza (Jerash) camp at Al Ḩaddādah village.\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 3,796 inhabitants in Jerash, of whom 270 were Christians.\nAccording to the Jordan national census of 2004, the population of the city was 31,650 and was ranked as the 14th largest municipality in Jordan. According to the last national census in 2015, the population of the city was 50,745, while the population of the governorate was 237,059.\n\nCulture and entertainment\nSince 1981, the old city of Jerash has hosted the Jerash Festival of Culture and Arts, a three-week-long summer program of dance, music, and theatrical performances.\nPerformances of the Roman Army and Chariot Experience (RACE) at the hippodrome in Jerash feature forty-five legionaries in full armor in a display of Roman army drill and battle tactics, ten gladiators fighting \"to the death\" and several Roman chariots competing in a classical seven-lap race around the ancient hippodrome.\n\nEducation\nJerash has two universities: Jerash Private University and Philadelphia University.\n\nTourism\nThe number of tourists who visited the ancient city of Jerash reached 214,000 during 2005. The number of non-Jordanian tourists was 182,000 last year, and the sum of entry charges reached JD900,000. The Jerash Festival of Culture and Arts is an annual celebration of Arabic and international culture during the summer months. Jerash is located 48 km north of the capital city of Amman. The festival site is located within the ancient ruins of Jerash, some of which date to the Roman age (63 BC). The Jerash Festival is a festival which features poetry recitals, theatrical performances, concerts and other forms of art. In 2008, authorities launched the Jordan Festival, a nationwide theme-oriented event under which the Jerash Festival became a component. However, the government revived the Jerash Festival as the \"substitute (Jordan Festival) proved to be not up to the message intended from the festival.\"\n\nGallery\nSee also\nExorcism of the Gerasene demoniac\nJerash Cathedral\nScythopolis (Beth-Shean)\nTemple of Artemis, Jerash\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBrown, J., E.

      "content": "Jerash (arabe : جرش Ǧaraš ; grec : Γέρασα, latinisé en Gerasa) est le chef-lieu de la province de Jerash, dans le Nord du royaume de Jordanie. La population de l'agglomération dépasse 120 000 habitants.\nLa ville moderne s'est établie autour du site de l'antique cité de Gérasa, parfois francisée en Gérase.\nLe site archéologique est inscrit depuis 2004 sur la liste indicative du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco.\n\nHistoire\nGérasa a été fondée durant le  IVe siècle av. J.-C., sur une implantation ancienne. Selon ses habitants, la ville aurait été fondée par Alexandre le Grand en faveur de vétérans de son armée, sous la direction de Perdiccas. Cette prétention s'est exprimée tardivement sous la forme d'une monnaie frappée pendant le règne de Caracalla au nom « d'Alexandre de Macédoine, fondateur de Gérasa ». Néanmoins la cité n'a pris son essor qu'au IIe siècle av. J.-C., les fouilles n'ayant pas permis de trouver les traces d'un établissement antérieur.\nLa ville est développée sous l'impulsion d'Antiochos IV Épiphane qui régna de 175 à 164, et connue à l'époque helléninistique sous le nom d'Antioche de Chrysorrhoas.\nLa ville fit partie de la Décapole. Elle fut conquise en 84 av. J.-C. par Alexandre Jannée qui y est mort en 76 av. J.-C. pendant le siège d'une forteresse voisine, Régaba. Elle est prise par le Nabatéen Arétas III en 73 av. J.-C., et enfin par les Romains (Pompée) en 63 av. J.-C. Ces derniers en firent une ville opulente : Gérasa reçut même la visite de l'empereur Hadrien en 129.\nGérasa devient siège d'un évêché au IVe siècle. Elle est ensuite pillée par les Perses en 614, puis les Arabes en 635. Elle subit ensuite plusieurs tremblements de terre, dont le plus dévastateur fut probablement celui de 747-748, qui affecta violemment de nombreuses autres villes de la région. Le coup de grâce lui fut donné par les affrontements entre Musulmans et Croisés lors des Croisades, où le temple d'Artémis fut transformé en forteresse par les Arabes.\nLes premières fouilles furent effectuées dans les années 1920-1930 par les membres de l'équipe américano-britannique de l'université Yale, de l'American School of oriental research, et de la British School of Jerusalem ; après la publication du rapport Kraeling en 1938, sur toutes les fouilles faites sur le site jusque-là, celles-ci connaissent un moment de flottement avant d'être reprises véritablement dans les années 1980, notamment sous la forme d'un projet de coopération international, faisant appel à des archéologues du monde entier, le Jerash Archaeological Project. Chaque équipe se vit attribuer une portion du site à fouiller et à rénover. L'équipe française, dirigée par Jacques Seigne, s'occupe encore aujourd'hui de la rénovation du sanctuaire de Zeus.\nLa Jérash moderne a connu une extension très rapide et atteint désormais 135 000 habitants, selon le recensement de 2004. Cet accroissement rapide de la population est dû à l'immigration intérieure et à l'arrivée de nombreux réfugiés palestiniens.\n\nSite archéologique\nUn grand nombre de monuments ont été dégagés et, souvent, reconstitués.\n\nArc d'Hadrien\nL'arc de triomphe a été érigé à l'extérieur de la ville, au sud de l’hippodrome, en 129-130, pour la visite de l'empereur Hadrien à Gérasa. L'arc était à l'origine destiné à servir de nouvelle porte à la ville, Hadrien, selon une inscription, voulant fonder un nouveau quartier de la ville dans ce secteur. Cependant, ce projet de construction n'aurait pas été mené à bien, faute de moyens à cette époque.\nAprès des travaux de restauration, certains effectués avec les pierres d'origine entre 2003 et 2008, la porte à trois ouvertures a retrouvé sa hauteur d'origine de 21 m, pour une largeur totale de plus de 25 m.\n\nHippodrome\nL'hippodrome de Gerasa est probablement l'un des plus petits du monde romain. À l'époque byzantine, fortement touché par les tremblements de terre, il ne fut pas reconstruit, mais occupé par la population locale, notamment pour abriter des ateliers de poterie, visibles grâce aux fameux fours en brique ; un diacre y fit édifier son église en réaménageant trois locaux désaffectés de l'hippodrome, qu'il pava de mosaïques.\n\nThéâtre du sud\nLe théâtre du sud a été bâti entre 90 et 92 après J.-C. Il comportait 32 rangées de sièges pouvant accueillir jusqu'à 5 000 spectateurs. Le théâtre est construit à flanc de colline à l'ouest du temple de Zeus, et le niveau supérieur a une voûte en berceau. La scène est conçue dans un style romain classique, avec deux portes latérales voûtées et trois entrées faisant partie du décor. Les spectateurs n'étaient pas aveuglés par la lumière du soleil, car le théâtre faisait face au nord.\n\nTemple de Zeus\nLe sanctuaire de Zeus Olympien est un vaste ensemble monumental qui s'étage à flanc de colline. Depuis ses origines aux VIIe – VIe siècles jusqu’à son développement maximum au milieu du IIe siècle apr. J.-C., ce sanctuaire a vu se succéder de nombreuses constructions et des agrandissements.\nLes deux grands temples de Zeus et d'Artémis furent construits essentiellement au milieu du IIe siècle apr. J.-C., entretenant une rivalité entre les fidèles de chacune des deux divinités.\nUn autre temple, sous l'église Saint-Théodore, était probablement dédié à Dionysos. Un quatrième temple, réduit à ses fondations, a été nommé « temple C » par les membres de l'équipe américano-britannique des années 1930, aucun indice n'ayant été retrouvé pour dire à quel dieu il était voué.\n\nLe temple de Zeus a été établi sur une énorme voûte en berceau construite sur la pente qui domine le forum ovale. Un temple dédié à Zeus avait probablement existé sur le site à l'époque hellénistique : l'implantation du temple ne correspond pas au plan d'une ville romaine. Les ruines datent du IIe siècle après J.-C. et présentent des murs dont certaines parties s'élèvent encore à 10 m de haut. Le temple lui-même reposait sur une plate-forme de 41 m de long et 28 m de large. Suivant le style de construction syro-nabatéen, un escalier menait au toit de la cella. Le sanctuaire était entouré de 38 colonnes, dont trois d'origine sont encore en place aujourd'hui, tandis que d'autres colonnes ont été de nouveau érigées dans le cadre du programme de restauration de l'Administration jordanienne des antiquités.\n\nForum ovale\nLe forum ovale se trouve au pied du temple de Zeus. Ses dimensions sont de 90 × 80 mètres. L'ovale est bordé de colonnades. L'endroit a été choisi stratégiquement, couvrant une dépression naturelle. Pour compenser cela, le forum a été construit sur une sous-structure de 6 à 8 mètres de haut. Le contour en forme de poire n'est pas typique d'un forum romain et la vocation de la place du marché ovale reste controversée : c'était soit un lieu de commerce, soit un lieu de sacrifice.\nLe forum ovale de Gerasa est probablement le plus grand forum de l'Empire romain : faisant à la fois office de place publique, d'agora et de marché (de nombreuses boutiques ont été retrouvées à ses abords), c'est un élément essentiel de l'urbanisme de la ville qui permet, par un artifice architectural, de faire la jonction visuelle entre le cardo maximus et le sanctuaire de Zeus qui semble ainsi se trouver dans la continuité de la voie principale de la cité.\n\nCardo maximus, portes et tétrapyles\nLe cardo maximus est la voie principale de la ville. Bordée de colonnades, elle dessert les espaces publics et la plupart des monuments, entre les portes nord et sud : théâtres, temples, marchés. Deux tétrapyles marquent le croisement avec les deux grandes artères est-ouest (decumanus).\n\nLe Cardo Maximus de Jerash, en Jordanie, est une voie principale construite sous le règne de l'empereur Trajan au début du IIe siècle après J.-C. Elle faisait partie d'un vaste projet d'urbanisation visant à intégrer Jerash dans le réseau commercial et culturel de l'Empire romain. Cette rue pavée de 800 mètres, bordée de colonnes corinthiennes, servait de colonne vertébrale à la ville, facilitant le commerce, le transport et les échanges culturels.\nJerash, connue sous le nom de Gerasa à l'époque romaine, était un important centre commercial et culturel. La construction du Cardo Maximus marquait une étape clé dans l'intégration de la ville à l'Empire romain. En 614 après J.-C., l'invasion des Perses Sassanides a causé des dommages significatifs à Jerash, mais la ville a continué à jouer un rôle crucial dans la région jusqu'à son déclin au VIIIe siècle.\n\nL'architecture du Cardo Maximus illustre l'innovation romaine avec ses larges dalles de pierre calcaire pour un drainage efficace et ses trottoirs surélevés pour la sécurité des piétons. Les colonnades offraient un abri contre les intempéries, transformant la rue en une zone commerçante animée. Les pierres de taille massive utilisées pour la construction démontrent la maîtrise technique des tailleurs de pierre romains.\nAu fil des siècles, le Cardo Maximus a subi des transformations, notamment des restaurations sous les Byzantins et les Omeyyades, et des dommages causés par des tremblements de terre, notamment celui de 749 après J.-C. Aujourd'hui, le Cardo Maximus est bien conservé, mais fait face à des défis de conservation, notamment l'érosion naturelle et l'impact du tourisme. Des efforts de préservation sont en cours pour protéger cette rue historique contre les dégradations futures.\nLe Cardo Maximus est un témoignage impressionnant de l'urbanisme romain et de l'importance de Jerash dans l'Empire romain, représentant un axe commercial vital et un lieu de rassemblement social et culturel.\n\nMarché (macellum)\nLe macellum ou marché était un lieu central pour le commerce, fortement présent dans la cité, comme on peut le voir d'après les nombreuses boutiques qui bordent les rues.\nLe macellum, construit dans le premier quart du IIe siècle de notre ère, a d'abord été considéré comme l'agora de la ville, le pendant politique du forum ovale. On le considère désormais comme un marché alimentaire. Au centre se trouve un octogone, autour duquel l'argent aurait été changé. Des lions soutenaient un banc qui a pu servir d'étal pour exposer les marchandises. Le sol était recouvert de mosaïques.\n\nNymphée\nLe magnifique nymphée, large de 22 mètres, date également du IIe siècle. Le sanctuaire à deux étages dédié aux nymphes de l'eau est l'un des bâtiments les mieux conservés de l'ancienne Gerasa. L'étage inférieur du nymphée était recouvert de marbre. Celui du haut était orné de fresques, dont certaines sont encore visibles. La construction du toit est frappante : un demi-dôme avec un pignon brisé, qui s'arque au-dessus d'une grande fontaine magnifique. La façade de la fontaine était divisée en niches qui abritaient des statues. Certaines statues tenaient de grands récipients d'où l'eau se déversait dans le bassin de la Grande Fontaine. Un système complexe de canalisations amenait l'eau des environs.\n\nTemple d'Artémis\nLe temple d'Artémis, du IIe siècle de notre ère, était particulièrement imposant avec les dimensions de son mur d'enceinte de 160 × 120 m : il était certainement l'un des édifices les plus importants de la ville. Les pèlerins s'approchaient du temple par une voie processionnelle et un escalier menant de la ville. Onze des 32 piliers originaux du temple ont été conservés, dont neuf, mesurent 13 mètres de haut, ont encore leurs chapiteaux corinthiens. La cella elle-même mesurait 23 × 40 m.\n\nCathédrale et autres églises paléochrétiennes\nAu IVe siècle, la communauté chrétienne était nombreuse et on a retrouvé les traces de treize églises aux sols recouverts de mosaïques, dont une cathédrale, la cathédrale Saint-Théodore. On a trouvé aussi les restes d'une synagogue de la même époque, située au nord-ouest du sanctuaire d'Artémis.\n\nOn a retrouvé un grand nombre d'églises de l'Antiquité tardive, notamment de l'époque de l'empereur Justinien (527 à 565), avec des sols en mosaïque en partie bien conservés :\n\nla « cathédrale », une basilique à colonnes à trois nefs de la fin du IVe siècle ;\nl'église de Théodose, basilique à hautes colonnes corinthiennes, 494-496 ;\nl'église de Prokopios, vers 526 ;\nl'église Saint-Georges, à partir de 529 ;\nl'église-synagogue, synagogue transformée en église vers 530/531 ;\nl'église Saint-Jean, de 531, un bâtiment rond d'environ 24 × 30 mètres ;\nl'église Saints-Côme-et-Damien, vers 533, avec un beau sol en mosaïque ;\nl'église Pierre-et-Paul : basilique à colonnes, vers 540, à côté l'église du Souvenir (église-halle) ;\nl'église des Propylées, vers 560 ;\nl'église de l'évêque Genesius, de 611.\n\nThéâtre du nord\nLe théâtre du nord est situé à côté du sanctuaire d'Artémis. Tout comme celui du sud, le théâtre du nord a été remarquablement restauré. Tous deux accueillent des spectacles locaux, généralement en période estivale.\n\nHabitations\nLes vestiges d'habitations sont relativement sommaires, et il s'agit en majorité de réoccupation de bâtiments publics de l'époque romaine : deux maisons ont été découvertes du côté oriental du wadi, recouvertes de mosaïques, dont l'une décrit un cortège bachique, et une seconde, les quatre saisons, thème que l'on rencontre assez fréquemment dans la région (voir notamment à Madaba) ; du côté ouest de la ville, la « maison des Bleus » est ainsi nommée d'après une inscription, ainsi qu'une splendide demeure d'époque byzantino-omeyyade, dont les vestiges apparents datent essentiellement de la période arabe ; enfin, un quartier d'habitation situé au nord-ouest de la cathédrale Saint-Théodore a été dégagé et fouillé rapidement dans les années 1930, comptant des structures domestiques individuelles, probablement destinées à loger les membres du clergé de la cathédrale. Cet ensemble se trouve aujourd'hui à nouveau enfoui sous le remblai résultant du dégagement du sanctuaire d'Artémis. À proximité se trouve la « Clergy House », encore visible, considérée par Kraeling comme un logement pour le clergé, mais dont la destination reste encore aujourd'hui douteuse, faute de fouilles approfondies.\n\nThermes\nDeux établissements de bains, qui s'étendaient au niveau du tétrapyle nord, sont en grande partie effondrés.\nLes « bains de Placcus », peu fouillés, mais apparemment de taille remarquable, étaient situés de l'autre côté du wadi de Jérash, c'est-à-dire du côté ouest de la ville, à côté de la cathédrale Saint-Théodore, juste au-dessous de la « Clergy House ». On distingue encore les vestiges des fours de l'hypocauste servant à chauffer le caldarium ; une inscription de l'extrême fin du Ve siècle en attribue la construction à l'évêque Placcus.\n\nMur d'enceinte\nUne muraille entoure encore presque toute la ville : après avoir laissé à l'abandon ses premiers murs créés avant notre ère, la cité s'entoura d'un nouveau rempart qui réduisit ses dimensions, la ramenant à la porte sud et laissant à l'extérieur toute la zone allant de la porte sud à l'arc d'Hadrien, et comprenant l'hippodrome.\n\nMusées archéologiques\nLe site archéologique de Jerash possède deux musées archéologiques.\n\nLe Musée archéologique de Jerash (en), qui est le plus ancien des deux, se trouve sur un monticule, à l’entrée sud du site, juste à l'est du cardo et surplombant le forum ovale. Le petit musée contient une présentation chronologique des artefacts trouvés dans et autour de Jerash, de la Préhistoire à l'époque islamique. Le musée présente un groupe unique de petites statues d'un groupe identifié comme les Muses du panthéon olympien, découvertes à Jerash en 2016. Les statues, d'époque romaine, retrouvées dans un état fragmentaire, ont été partiellement restaurées. Le musée conserve un sarcophage de plomb bien conservé datant de la fin du IVe siècle, présentant des symboles chrétiens et païens. Le musée possède aussi un certain nombre de sculptures, autels et mosaïques exposés à l'extérieur.\nLe centre d'accueil des visiteurs de Jerash comprend un second musée archéologique plus récent, qui présente le site de Jerash dans une approche thématique, mettant l'accent sur l'évolution et le développement de la ville au fil du temps, ainsi que sur l'économie, la technologie, la religion et la vie quotidienne. Le centre présente d'autres sculptures découvertes en 2016, notamment des statues restaurées de Zeus et d'Aphrodite, ainsi qu'une tête féminine en marbre supposée représenter l'impératrice romaine Julia Domna.\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nAndré Gagné, « De l’intentio operis à l’intentio lectoris : Essai herméneutique à partir de l’épisode du démoniaque de Gérasa (Mc 5,1-20) », Théologiques, vol. 12, nos 1–2,‎ 2004, p. 213–232 (lire en ligne)\nMaurice Sartre, D'Alexandre à Zénobie.

      "content": "## Overview\nJerash, a city in northern Jordan, is famous for its Roman ruins. The archaeological site is popular for tourists, second only to Petra.\n\n## Understand\n48 km (30 miles) north of the capital Amman, Jerash is known for the ruins of the Greco-Roman city of Gerasa, also referred to as Antioch on the Golden River. It is sometimes misleadingly referred to as the \"Pompeii of the Middle East\", referring to its size, extent of excavation and level of preservation (though Jerash was never buried by a volcano).\nJerash became an urban center during the 3rd century BC and a member of the federation of Greek cities known as the Decapolis (\"ten cities\" in Greek). Jerash prospered during the 1st century BC as a result of its position on the incense and spice trade route from the Arabian Peninsula to Syria and the Mediterranean region. Jerash was a favorite city of the Roman emperor, Hadrian, and reached its zenith in AD 130, flourishing economically and socially. The city began to decline in the 3rd century, later becoming a Christian city under the rule of the Byzantine empire. The Muslims took over in AD 635, but the final blow to the city was dealt by Baldwin II of Jerusalem in AD 1112 during the Crusades.\nModern Jerash sprawls to the east of the ruins, sharing the same city wall but little else. Thankfully, the ruins have been carefully preserved and spared from encroachment.\n\n## By car\nFrom 8th Circle in Amman, take the north-west road out towards Salt. Eventually you must turn northward, but brown tourism signs clearly mark the road towards Jerash.\n\n## By bus\nGetting to Jerash is very easy and cost effective on your own and you don't need a tour. You can go to Jerash and back for 2 JD from the Tabarbour Bus Station (North station) in Amman, or from Sweileh park. At the Tabarbour Bus Station, buses leave for Jerash – 1.00 JD, about one hour, but are not that frequent (May 2025) since the BRT is running. It is better to take them close to the Sweileh park (1.00 JD). From downtown Amman, take the BRT (Bus Rapid Transfer) at the Jordan Museum and go directly to its terminus at Sweileh BRT Station. From there, leave the station, cross the park and ask people for the serviis to Jerash.\nIn Jerash, the minibuses to Amman leave from a junction by the handicraft building (10-minute walk south from the visitor's centre). When coming back to downtown from Tabarbour station tell the taxi driver you are going to Raghadan Al Seyaha. There is another Raghadan station in Amman that is a few kilometers from downtown so the last stop may be that one!\n\n## By taxi\nA private taxi from Amman can be hired for 8-10 JD one-way. Expect to pay as much as 40 JD for a return trip and taxi driver staying on site while you look around. As always, negotiate the amount beforehand and specify that the price is for the whole taxi and not \"per person,\" which most taxi drivers will try to charge you.\n\n## Get around\nWalking is the only choice you have – about 3 km all together. Get in at the south end of the archaeological site south of the Hippodrome. The North Gate is closed.\n\n## See\nSigns describing the history of each set of ruins have been introduced, and you can pick up a map to orient yourself at the Visitor Centre, at the South Gate of the archaeological park. You can exit at the North Gate, which is across from the bus station.\nThe ruins are extensive compared to many other sites, but it's not hard to see everything in a couple of hours. It is unlikely that visitors will miss anything important.\nBeware of the many touts inside the area, who will try to sell you \"original\" coins, artifacts and antiques, after they helped you taking your picture. If they stand in the way of your picture in front of the many sights, especially the Nymphaeum and the Temple of Artemis, firmly ask them to step aside. If they do not cooperate, tell them you will complain with the visitor center.\nIf you go first thing in the morning, you can avoid most of the tour groups arriving from Amman.\nJerash Ruins.

The Jordan Trail spans the entire length of Jordan, stretching from Umm Qais in the north to Aqaba in the south, covering over 650 kilometers and passing through 52 villages and towns. This extensive hiking route offers a captivating 40-day journey through the diverse landscapes of Jordan.\n\n## Buy\nJust outside of the archaeological park's South Gate is a small souq — an outdoor bazaar, of sorts — that provides a well-rounded offering of Jordanian souvenirs and handicrafts. Many of the shop keepers are amiable and are willing to bargain over prices. Local children and teens will try to sell you Roman coins and other small artefacts found on the site. Please refrain from buying from them, as this practice is not legal.\n\n## Eat\nAlong the road into Jerash there are several other restaurants from which to choose.\n32.26728935.8887111 The Lebanese House (Walk past the police kiosk on the main street and turn down the dirt road), ☏ +962 26351301. Cooks up some good Lebanese food, particularly when it comes to Mezza.\n\n## Sleep\n32.2723235.8922471 Hadrian's Gate Hotel, Jerash Main Road, opposite Hadrian's Arch, ☏ +962 77 779 3907. Inexpensive and very conveniently located across the road from the entrance to the archaeological park.\n32.29616535.8550432 [dead link] The Olive Branch, Ajloun Road (7 km outside town), ☏ +962 2 634 0555, fax: +962 2 634 0557, olivekh@go.com.jo. In the hills above town. Quiet and relaxed with a nice swimming pool, but only accessible by car or taxi. Apparently also has a campground. Own tent is required. The campground has lots of resort type luxuries. 5 JD for the campground.\n32.25010335.833433 Dibbin National Park. Camping. A bit outside the main town, recommended to visit in the week, the weekends are pretty busy. 3 JD.\n\n## Go next\nThe 32.28540935.8952791 Jerash Bus Station is outside the northern end of the Jerash archaeological side. However, buses also leave from the 32.27022735.8909342 main junction in Jerash just south of the Hippodrome to Amman and Ajlun Castle.\nAjlun & Ajlun Castle – The castle is an interesting maze of passages and levels, and offers a wonderful view of the surrounding area, northwestern Jordan, and off into Galilee. This Islamic fortress is a mere 16 km east from Jerash. The castle is located on the top of a mountain just outside the small city of Ajlun. If you start your day early enough, you can take the bus from Amman to Ajlun and see the castle. Afterwards take a bus from 'Ajloun to Jerash, while still having plenty of time to spend at Jerash. Ajlun and Jerash make a good combination day; however, most buses travel from Ajlun to Jerash and not the other direction. Therefore, it is better to travel from Amman to Aljun Castle, then to Jerash, then back to Amman. Once in Aljun, take a taxi to Aljun Castle and arrange for the taxi to wait for you or to transport you back to the Aljun bus station. In the afternoon the buses become infrequent and you run the risk of being left in one of the cities if you do not plan accordingly, especially during Ramadan. If this occurs, stand around across from the police station and you can probably bargain with a private driver to take you back to Amman.\nIrbid – The main industrial and administrative centre in the north of the kingdom, and a staging point for exploration further afield to Gadara (Umm Qais), Pella and other nearby sites within the region. 40 km north of Jerash.",
