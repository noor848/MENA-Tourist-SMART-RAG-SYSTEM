      "content": "Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء‎, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα, lit. 'Rock'), originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu (Nabataean Aramaic: 𐢛𐢚𐢒‎ or 𐢛𐢚𐢓𐢈‎, *Raqēmō), is an ancient city and archaeological site in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also called the \"Rose City\" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved. The city is one of the New 7 Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and was settled by the Nabataeans, a nomadic Arab people, in the 4th century BC. Petra would later become the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom in the second century BC. The Nabataeans invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub, which gained them considerable revenue. Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and thus were able to defend their kingdom. They were particularly skillful in agriculture, stone carving, and rainwater harvesting.\nPetra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants. Nabataea fell to the Romans in 106 AD, who annexed and renamed it Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.\nUNESCO has described Petra as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\". Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Visitor numbers reach close to a million tourists every year.\n\nHistory\nNeolithic\nBy 7000 BC, some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in Beidha, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement just north of Petra.\n\nBronze Age\nPetra is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and the Amarna letters as Pel, Sela, or Seir.\n\nIron Age Edom\nThe Iron Age lasted between 1200 and 600 BC; in that time, the Petra area was occupied by the Edomites. The configuration of mountains in Petra allowed for a reservoir of water for the Edomites. This made Petra a stopping point for merchants, making it an outstanding area for trade. Some wares that were traded included wines, olive oil, and wood.\nInitially, the Edomites were accompanied by Nomads who eventually left, but the Edomites stayed and made their mark on Petra before the emergence of the Nabataens. It is said that 10,000 men were thrown off of the mountain Umm el-Biyara, but this story has been debated by scholars.\nThe Edomite site excavated at the top of the Umm el-Biyara mountain at Petra was established no earlier than the seventh century BC (Iron II).\n\nEmergence of Petra\nThe Nabataeans were one among several nomadic Bedouin tribes that roamed the Arabian Desert and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water. Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, theories about them having Aramean roots are rejected by many modern scholars. Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern Arabian tribe. Current evidence suggests that the Nabataean name for Petra was Raqēmō, variously spelled in inscriptions as rqmw or rqm.\nThe Jewish historian Josephus (ca. 37–100 AD) writes that the region was inhabited by the Midianites during the time of Moses, and that they were ruled by five kings, one of whom was Rekem. Josephus mentions that the city, called Petra by the Greeks, \"ranks highest in the land of the Arabs\" and was still called Rekeme by all the Arabs of his time, after its royal founder (Antiquities iv. 7, 1; 4, 7). The Onomasticon of Eusebius also identified Rekem as Petra. Arabic raqama means \"to mark, to decorate\", so Rekeme could be a Nabataean word referring to the famous carved rock façades. In 1964, workmen clearing rubble away from the cliff at the entrance to the gorge found several funerary inscriptions in Nabatean script. One of them was to a certain Petraios who was born in Raqmu (Rekem) and buried in Garshu (Jerash).\n\nAn old theory held that Petra might be identified with a place called sela in the Hebrew Bible. Encyclopædia Britannica (1911) states that the Semitic name of the city, if not Sela, would remain unknown. It nevertheless cautioned that sela simply means \"rock\" in Hebrew, and thence might not be identified with a city where it occurs in the biblical text in the book of Obadiah. It is possible that the city was part of the nation of Edom.\nThe passage in Diodorus Siculus (xix. 94–97) described the Nabataeans at the time as a nomadic group of people who believed that those who owned possessions could be easily compelled by those who held power, this would drastically change as the centuries went on.\nThis text further describes the expeditions which Antigonus sent against the Nabataeans in 312 BC, was understood by some researchers to throw some light upon the history of Petra, but the \"petra\" (Greek for rock) referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper name, and the description implies that there was no town in existence there at the time.\n\nRoman period\nIn 106, when Aulus Cornelius Palma Frontonianus was governor of Roman Syria, the part of the Arabian Peninsula under the rule of Petra was absorbed into the Roman Empire as part of Arabia Petraea, and Petra became its capital. The native dynasty came to an end but the city continued to flourish under Roman rule. It was around this time that the Petra Roman Road was built. A century later, in the time of Severus Alexander, when the city was at the height of its splendor, the issue of coinage came to an end. There was no more building of sumptuous tombs, owing apparently to some sudden catastrophe, such as an invasion by the Sasanian Empire.\nMeanwhile, as Palmyra (fl. 130–270) grew in importance and attracted the pre-Islamic Arab trade away from Petra, the latter declined. It appears, however, to have lingered on as a religious center. Another Roman road was constructed at the site. Epiphanius of Salamis (c.315–403) writes that in his time a feast was held there on December 25 in honor of the virgin Khaabou and her offspring Dushara. Dushara and al-Uzza were two of the principal deities of the city, which otherwise included many idols from other Nabataean deities such as Allat and Manat.\nBetween 111 and 114, Trajan built the Via Traiana Nova, running from the Syrian border to the Red Sea through Petra. This road followed the old routes of Nabataean caravans. In the shadow of the Pax Romana, this route revived trade between Arabia, Syria, and Mediterranean harbors. In 125 AD, one of Emperor Hadrian's administrators left marks in Petra, pointed out by documents found at the Dead Sea. In 130, Hadrian visited the former Nabataean capital, giving it the name of Hadriānī Petra Metropolis, imprinted on his coins. His visit, however, did not lead to any boom in development and new buildings as it did in Jerash. The province's governor, Sextius Florentinus, erected a monumental mausoleum for his son near the end of the al-Hubta (King's Wall) tombs, which had been generally reserved during the Nabataean period for the royal family.\nRoman emperors' interest in the city in the 3rd century suggests that Petra and its environs remained highly esteemed for a long time. An inscription to Liber Pater, a god revered by Emperor Septimius Severus, was found in the temenos of the temple known as Qasr al-Bint, and Nabataean tombs contained silver coins with the emperor's portrait as well as pottery from his reign. Emperor Elagabalus declared Petra to be a Roman colony, when he reorganized the Roman Empire towards the end of the 3rd century. The area from Petra to Wadi Mujib, the Negev, and the Sinai Peninsula were annexed into the province of Palaestina Salutaris. The Madaba Map from the reign of Emperor Justinian I is missing the section that would include Petra.\n\nByzantine period\nPetra declined rapidly under Roman rule, in large part from the revision of sea-based trade routes. In 363, an earthquake destroyed many buildings and crippled the vital water management system. The old city of Petra was the capital of the Byzantine province of Palaestina III and many churches from the Byzantine period were excavated in and around Petra. In one of them, the Byzantine Church, 140 papyri were discovered, which contained mainly contracts dated from 530s to 590s, establishing that the city was still flourishing in the 6th century. The Byzantine Church is a prime example of monumental architecture in Byzantine Petra.\nThe last reference to Byzantine Petra comes from the Spiritual Meadow of John Moschus, written in the first decades of the 7th century. He gives an anecdote about its bishop, Athenogenes. It ceased to be a metropolitan bishopric sometime before 687 when that function had been transferred to Areopolis. Petra is not mentioned in the narratives of the Muslim conquest of the Levant, nor does it appear in any early Islamic records.\n\nCrusaders and Mamluks\nIn the 12th century, the Crusaders built fortresses such as the Alwaeira Castle, but were forced to abandon Petra after a while. As a result, the location of Petra was lost until the 19th century\nTwo further Crusader-period castles are known in and around Petra: the first is al-Wu'ayra, situated just north of Wadi Musa. It can be viewed from the road to Little Petra. It is the castle that was seized by a band of Turks with the help of local Muslims and only recovered by the Crusaders after they began to destroy the olive trees of Wadi Musa. The potential loss of livelihood led the locals to negotiate a surrender. The second is on the summit of el-Habis, in the heart of Petra, and can be accessed from the West side of the Qasr al-Bint.\nThe ruins of Petra were an object of curiosity during the Middle Ages and were visited by Baibars, one of the first Mamluk sultans of Egypt, towards the end of the 13th century.\n\n19th and 20th centuries\nThe first European to describe them was the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt during his travels in 1812. At that time, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem operated a diocese in al-Karak named Battra (Arabic: باطره, Ancient Greek: Πέτρας) and it was the opinion among the clergy of Jerusalem that Kerak was the ancient city of Petra.\nBurckhardt already spoke Arabic fluently, and was on his way to explore the Niger River when he heard stories of a dead city that held the tomb of the Prophet Aaron, and became fascinated with finding the city. He then dressed himself up as a local, and only spoke in Arabic, bringing a goat with him with the intent of sacrificing it in honor of Aaron's Tomb. After one day of exploring, he was convinced that he had found the lost city of Petra.\nLéon de Laborde and Louis-Maurice-Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds made the first accurate drawings of Petra in 1828. The Scottish painter David Roberts visited Petra in 1839 and returned to Britain with sketches and stories of the encounter with local tribes, published in The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia. Frederic Edwin Church, the leading American landscape painter of the 19th century, visited Petra in 1868, and the resulting painting El Khasné, Petra is among his most important and well-documented. Missionary Archibald Forder published photographs of Petra in the December 1909 issue of National Geographic.\n\nBecause the structures weakened with age, many of the tombs became vulnerable to thieves, and many treasures were stolen. In 1929, a four-person team consisting of British archaeologists Agnes Conway and George Horsfield, Palestinian physician and folklore expert Tawfiq Canaan and Ditlef Nielsen, a Danish scholar, excavated and surveyed Petra.\nThe archaeologist Philip Hammond from the University of Utah visited Petra for nearly 40 years. He explained that the local folklore says it was created by the wand of Moses, when he struck the rock to bring forth water for the Israelites. Hammond believed the carved channels deep within the walls and ground were made from ceramic pipes that once fed water for the city, from rock-cut systems on the canyon rim.\nIn the 1980s, the Bedul Bedouin, once inhabitants of Petra, were relocated by the Jordanian government to the nearby settlement of Umm Sayhoun, a process spanning two decades. This move was part of broader initiatives aimed at settling Bedouin communities and promoting tourism in Petra. With a name meaning \"the changing ones\" and oral traditions recounting a conversion narrative, the Bedul Bedouins are believed to have adopted Islam later in their history, possibly with Jewish or Nabatean origins. Today, alongside their traditional activities, they engage in local tourism, alongside the more prominent Liyathnah tribe.\nNumerous scrolls in Greek and dating to the Byzantine period were discovered in an excavated church near the Temple of the Winged Lions in Petra in December 1993.\n\n21st century\nIn December 2022, Petra was hit by heavy flooding.\n\nLayout\nPetra is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.\nExcavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificial oasis. The area is visited by flash floods, but archaeological evidence shows that the Nabataeans controlled these floods by the use of dams, cisterns, and water conduits. These innovations stored water for prolonged periods of drought and enabled the city to prosper from its sale.\nIn ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra, around Jabal Haroun (\"Aaron's Mountain\"), the location of the Tomb of Aaron, said to be the burial place of Aaron, brother of Moses. Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north. Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east. The impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge, in places only 3–4 m (10–13 ft) wide, called the Siq (\"shaft\"), a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the sandstone rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into Wadi Musa.\n\nHellenistic architecture\nPetra is known primarily for its Hellenistic architecture. The facades of the tombs in Petra are commonly rendered in Hellenistic style, reflecting the number of diverse cultures with which the Nabataeans traded, all of which were in turn influenced by Greek culture. Most of these tombs contain small burials niches carved into the stone.\nPerhaps the best example of the Hellenistic style is seen in the Treasury, which is 24 meters (79 ft) wide and 37 meters (121 ft) tall and refers to the architecture of Alexandria. The facade of the Treasury features a broken pediment with a central tholos inside, and two obelisks appear to form into the rock at the top. Near the bottom of the Treasury are the twin Greek gods Castor and Pollux, who protect travellers on their journeys. Near the top of the Treasury, two victories are seen standing on each side of a female figure on the tholos. This female figure is believed to be the Isis-Tyche, Isis and Tyche being the Egyptian and Greek goddesses, respectively, of good fortune.\nAnother prime example of Hellenistic architecture featured in Petra is its Monastery, which stands at 45 meters (148 ft) tall and 50 meters (160 ft) wide; this is Petra's largest monument and is similarly carved into the rock face. The facade of this again features a broken pediment, similar to the Treasury, as well as another central tholos. The Monastery displays more of a Nabataen touch while at the same time incorporating elements from Greek architecture. Its only source of light is its entrance standing at 8 meters (26 ft) high. There is a large space outside of the Monastery, which is purposefully flattened for worship purposes. Formerly, in the Byzantine period, this was a place for Christian worship, but is now a holy site for pilgrims to visit.\n\nCity centre\nAt the end of the narrow gorge, the Siq, stands Petra's most elaborate ruin, popularly known as Al-Khazneh (\"the Treasury\"), hewn into the sandstone cliff. While remaining in remarkably preserved condition, the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local Bedouin tribes that hoped to dislodge riches that were once rumoured to be hidden within it.\nA little farther from the Treasury, at the foot of the mountain called en-Nejr, is a massive theatre, positioned so as to bring the greatest number of tombs within view. At the point where the valley opens out into the plain, the site of the city is revealed with striking effect. The theatre was cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs during its construction. Rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible. Almost enclosing it on three sides are rose-coloured mountain walls, divided into groups by deep fissures and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers. The theatre  was said to hold around 8,500 people. The performances that audiences were able to attend here were poetry readings and dramas. Gladiator fights were also said to be held here and attracted the most audience, although no gladiator was able to gain any momentum or fame due to the heavy mortality rate that came with it. The theatre was one of many structures in Petra that took significant damage due to the 363 Galilee earthquake.\n\nThe Petra Pool and Garden Complex is a series of structures within the city center. Originally said to be a market area, excavations at the site have allowed scholars to identify it as an elaborate Nabataean garden, which included a large swimming pool, an island-pavilion, and an intricate hydraulic system.\nAhead of the Petra Pool and Garden Complex lies Colonnaded street, which is among few artifacts of Petra that was constructed rather than natural. This street used to hold a semi-circle nymphaeum, which is now in ruins due to flash flooding, and used to hold Petra's only tree. This was intended to be a symbol for the peaceful atmosphere that the Nabataens were able to construct in Petra. Once the Romans took control of the city, Colonnaded street was narrowed to make room for a side walk, and 72 columns were added to each side.\n\nHigh Place of Sacrifice\nThe High Place of Sacrifice is perched atop Jebel Madbah Mountain. The beginning of the hike is near Petra's theatre. From there, the site of The High Place of Sacrifice is around an 800-step hike. One commonly believed sacrifice that took place there was libation. Another common form of sacrifice that took place there was animal sacrifice; this is due to the belief that the tomb of the Prophet Aaron is located in Petra, which is a sacred site for Muslims. In honor of this, a goat was sacrificed annually. Other rituals also took place there, including the burning of frankincense.\n\nRoyal Tombs\nThe Royal Tombs of Petra are in the Nabatean version of Hellenistic architecture, but their facades have worn due to natural decay. One of these tombs, the Palace Tomb, is speculated to be the tomb for the kings of Petra. The Corinthian Tomb, which is right next to the Palace Tomb, has the same Hellenistic architecture featured on the Treasury. The two other Royal Tombs are the Silk Tomb and the Urn Tomb; the Silk Tomb does not stand out as much as the Urn Tomb. The Urn Tomb features a large yard in its front, and was turned into a church in 446 AD after the expansion of Christianity.\n\nExterior platform\nIn 2016, archaeologists using satellite imagery and drones discovered a very large, previously unknown monumental structure whose beginnings were tentatively dated to about 150 BC, the time when the Nabataeans initiated their public building programme. It is located outside the main area of the city, at the foot of Jabal an-Nmayr and about 0.5 mi (0.8 km) south of the city centre, but is facing east, not towards the city, and has no visible relationship to it. The structure consists of a huge, 184 by 161 ft (56 by 49 m) platform, with a monumental staircase along its eastern side. The large platform enclosed a slightly smaller one, topped with a comparatively small building, 28 by 28 ft (8.5 by 8.5 m), which was facing east toward the staircase. The structure, second in size only to the Monastery complex, probably had a ceremonial function of which not even a speculative explanation has yet been offered by the researchers.\n\nGeostrategic importance\nPliny the Elder and other writers identify Petra as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom and the centre of their caravan trade. Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a perennial stream, Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress, but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to Gaza in the west, to Bosra and Damascus in the north, to Aqaba and Leuce Come on the Red Sea, and across the desert to the Persian Gulf.\n\nReligious importance\nNabataean religion\nThe Nabataeans worshipped Arab gods and goddesses during the pre-Islamic era as well as a few of their deified kings. One, Obodas I, was deified after his death in 85 BC. Dushara was the primary male god accompanied by his three female deities: Al-‘Uzzā, Allat and Manāt. Many statues carved in the rock depict these gods and goddesses. New evidence indicates that broader Edomite, and Nabataean theology had strong links to Earth-Sun relationships, often manifested in the orientation of prominent Petra structures to equinox and solstice sunrises and sunsets.\n\nThe Monastery, Petra's largest monument, dates from the 1st century BC. It was dedicated to Obodas I and is believed to be the symposium of Obodas the god. This information is inscribed on the ruins of the Monastery (the name is the translation of the Arabic Ad Deir).\nThe Temple of the Winged Lions is a large temple complex dated to the reign of King Aretas IV (9 BC–40 AD). The temple is located in Petra's so-called Sacred Quarter, an area situated at the end of Petra's main Colonnaded Street consisting of two majestic temples, the Qasr al-Bint and, opposite, the Temple of the Winged Lions on the northern bank of Wadi Musa.\n\nLate Roman and Byzantine-period Christianity\nChristianity found its way to Petra during the 4th century AD, nearly 500 years after the establishment of Petra as a trade centre, and the city was gradually converted over the course of the 4th century and possibly into the early 5th century AD. The start of Christianity in Petra started primarily in 330 AD when the first Christian emperor of Rome took over, Constantine I, otherwise known as Constantine the Great. Together with Licinius, he issued a decree of tolerance which stopped the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire.  Athanasius mentions a bishop of Petra (Antioch. 10) named Asterius. At least one of the tombs (now known as the \"Urn Tomb\") was used as a church. An inscription in red paint records its consecration \"in the time of the most holy bishop Jason\" (447).\n\nEarly Muslim and Crusader periods\nAfter the  Muslim conquest of 629–632, Christianity in Petra, as of most of Arabia, gave way to Islam.\nIn the wake of the First Crusade, part of Transjordan including Petra was conquered by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem and formed the second fief of the barony of Krak (in the lordship of Oultrejordain) with the title Château de la Valée de Moyse or Sela. It remained in the hands of the Franks until 1189. It is still a titular see of the Catholic Church - see Archbishop of Petra and List of Catholic titular sees: Petra in Palaestina.\n\nTraditional connection to Moses, Aaron and Miriam\nAccording to a tradition, Petra is the spot where Moses (Musa in Arabic) struck a rock with his staff and water came forth, and where Moses' brother, Aaron (Harun in Arabic), is buried, at Mount Hor, known in Arabic as Jabal Haroun, 'Mount Aaron'. Placing the death of Aaron on a mountain peak near Petra dates back to at least the time of Josephus (see Antiquities IV. 4, 7). A memorial church built in the saddle under the peak in the 5th century became the nucleus of a monastery frequented by pilgrims, named in a document from among the Petra papyri and dated to 573 as \"the House of ... High Priest Aaron.\" Wadi Musa or the \"Wadi of Moses\" is the Arabic name for the narrow valley at the head of which Petra is sited.\nA mountaintop shrine of Moses' sister Miriam was still shown to pilgrims at the time of Jerome in the 4th century, but its location has not been identified since.\n\nClimate\nIn Petra, there is a semi-arid climate. Most rain falls in the winter. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification is BSk. The average annual temperature in Petra is 15.5 °C (59.9 °F). About 193 mm (7.60 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nConservation\nThe Bedul (Petra Bedouin) were forcibly resettled from their cave dwellings in Petra to Umm Sayhoun/Um Seihun by the Jordanian government in 1985, prior to the UNESCO designation process. They were provided with block-built housing with some infrastructure including in particular a sewage and drainage system. Among the six communities in the Petra Region, Umm Sayhoun is one of the smaller communities. The village of Wadi Musa is the largest in the area, inhabited largely by the Layathnah Bedouin, and is now the closest settlement to the visitor centre, the main entrance via the Siq and the archaeological site generally. Umm Sayhoun gives access to the 'back route' into the site, the Wadi Turkmaniyeh pedestrian route.\nOn December 6, 1985, Petra was designated a World Heritage Site. In a popular poll in 2007, it was also named one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. The Petra Archaeological Park (PAP) became an autonomous legal entity over the management of this site in August 2007.\n\nThe Bedoul belong to one of the Bedouin tribes whose cultural heritage and traditional skills were proclaimed by UNESCO on the Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2005 and inscribed in 2008.\nIn 2011, following an 11-month project planning phase, the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority in association with DesignWorkshop and JCP s.r.l published a Strategic Master Plan that guides planned development of the Petra Region. This is intended to guide planned development of the Petra Region in an efficient, balanced and sustainable way over the next 20 years for the benefit of the local population and of Jordan in general. As part of this, a Strategic Plan was developed for Umm Sayhoun and surrounding areas.\nThe process of developing the Strategic Plan considered the area's needs from five points of view:\n\nA socio-economic perspective\nThe perspective of Petra Archaeological Park\nThe perspective of Petra's tourism product\nA land use perspective\nAn environmental perspective\nThe site suffers from a host of threats, including collapse of ancient structures, erosion due to flooding and improper rainwater drainage, weathering from salt upwelling, improper restoration of ancient structures, and unsustainable tourism. The last has increased substantially, especially since the site received widespread media coverage in 2007 during the New 7 Wonders of the World Internet and cellphone campaign. Tourism has steadily grown, with Petra receiving 1.2 million total visitors in 2019.\nIn an attempt to reduce the problems, the Petra National Trust (PNT) was established in 1989. It has worked with numerous local and international organisations on projects that promote the protection, conservation, and preservation of the Petra site. Moreover, UNESCO and ICOMOS recently collaborated to publish their first book on human and natural threats to the sensitive World Heritage sites. They chose Petra as its first and the most important example of threatened landscapes. The presentation Tourism and Archaeological Heritage Management at Petra: Driver to Development or Destruction? (2012) was the first in a series to address the very nature of these deteriorating buildings, cities, sites, and regions.\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) released a video in 2018 highlighting the abuse of working animals in Petra. PETA claimed that animals are forced to carry tourists or pull carriages every day. The video showed handlers beating and whipping working animals, with beatings intensifying when animals faltered. PETA also showed some wounded animals, including camels with fly-infested, open wounds. The Jordanian authority running the site responded by proposing a veterinary clinic, and by undertaking to spread awareness among animal handlers. In 2020, more video released by PETA indicated that conditions for the animals had not improved and, in 2021, the organization was running what appeared to be the only veterinary clinic in the area.\n\nPetra is a site at the intersection of natural and cultural heritage forming a unique cultural landscape. Ever since Johann Ludwig Burckhardt aka Sheikh Ibrahim had re-discovered the ruin city in Petra, Jordan, in 1812, the cultural heritage site has attracted different people who shared an interest in the ancient history and culture of the Nabataeans such as travellers, pilgrims, painters and savants. However, it was not until the late 19th century that the ruins were systematically approached by archaeological researchers. Since then regular archaeological excavations and ongoing research on the Nabataean culture have been part of today's UNESCO world cultural heritage site Petra. Through the excavations in the Petra Archaeological Park an increasing number of Nabataean cultural heritage is being exposed to environmental impact. A central issue is the management of water impacting the built heritage and the rock hewn facades. The large number of discoveries and the exposure of structures and findings demand conservation measures respecting the interlinkage between the natural landscape and cultural heritage, as especially this connection is a central challenge at the UNECSO World Heritage Site.\nIn recent years different conservation campaigns and projects were established at the cultural heritage site of Petra. The main works first focussed on the entrance situation of the Siq to protect tourists and to facilitate access. Also, different projects for conservation and conservation research were conducted. Following is a list of projects, to be continued.\n\n1958 Restoration of the third pillar of the Treasury building (Al-Khazneh).

It played a prominent role in the Marcus Didius Falco mystery novel Last Act in Palmyra, and is the setting for Agatha Christie's Appointment with Death. In Blue Balliett's novel Chasing Vermeer, the character Petra Andalee is named after the site.\nIn 1979 Marguerite van Geldermalsen from New Zealand married Mohammed Abdullah, a Bedouin in Petra.

      "summary": "Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء‎, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα, lit. 'Rock'), originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu (Nabataean Aramaic: 𐢛𐢚𐢒‎ or 𐢛𐢚𐢓𐢈‎, *Raqēmō), is an ancient city and archaeological site in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also called the \"Rose City\" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved. The city is one of the New 7 Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and was settled by the Nabataeans, a nomadic Arab people, in the 4th century BC. Petra would later become the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom in the second century BC. The Nabataeans invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub, which gained them considerable revenue. Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and thus were able to defend their kingdom. They were particularly skillful in agriculture, stone carving, and rainwater harvesting.\nPetra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants. Nabataea fell to the Romans in 106 AD, who annexed and renamed it Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.\nUNESCO has described Petra as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\". Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Visitor numbers reach close to a million tourists every year.",

      "content": "البتراء أو البترا أو البطراء مدينة أثرية وتاريخية تقع في محافظة معان في جنوب المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية. تشتهر بعمارتها المنحوتة بالصخور ونظام قنوات جر المياه القديمة. أُطلق عليها قديمًا اسم «سلع»، كما سُميت بـ «المدينة الوردية» نسبةً لألوان صخورها الملتوية.\nأُسست البتراء تقريبًا في عام 312 ق.م عاصمة لمملكة الأنباط. وقد تبوأت مكانةً مرموقةً لسنوات طويلة، حيث كان لموقعها على طريق الحرير، والمتوسط لحضارات بلاد ما بين النهرين وفلسطين ومصر، دورًا كبيرًا جعل من دولة الأنباط تمسك بزمام التجارة بين حضارات هذه المناطق وسكانها. وتقع المدينة على منحدرات جبل المذبح، بين مجموعة من الجبال الصخرية الشاهقة، التي تُشكل الخاصرة الشمالية الغربية لشبه الجزيرة العربية، وتحديدًا وادي عربة، الممتد من البحر الميت وحتى خليج العقبة.\nبقي موقع البتراء غير مكتشف للغرب طيلة الفترة العثمانية، حتى أعاد اكتشافها المستشرق السويسري يوهان لودفيغ بركهارت عام 1812. وقد أُدرجت مدينة البتراء على لائحة التراث العالمي التابعة لليونسكو في عام 1985. واختيرت إحدى عجائب الدنيا السبع الجديدة عام 2007.\nوتُعد البتراء اليوم، رمزًا للأردن، وأكثر الأماكن جذبًا للسياح على مستوى المملكة. كما أنها واحدة من أهم الوجهات السياحية لزعماء العالم. ولقد احتفلت المدينة بالزائر رقم مليون لأول مرة في تاريخ السياحة الأردنيّة، وذلك في شهر تشرين الثاني/ نوفمبر 2019.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع مدينة البتراء في لواء البتراء التابع لمحافظة معان، على بعد 225 كيلومتر جنوب العاصمة الأردنية عمّان، وإلى الغرب من الطريق الصحراوي الذي يصل بين عمّان ومدينة العقبة على ساحل خليج العقبة. يقع اللواء في الجهة الغربية من مدينة معان مركز المحافظة، ويبعد عنها 36 كم. ويتواجد على امتداد سلسلة جبال الشراة المطلة على وادي عربة وطبيعتها الجغرافية المنحدرة والمحاطة بالجبال. تبلغ مساحة اللواء 900 كم2 ، أما مساحة المحمية الأثرية فتبلغ 264 كم2. وتُعتبر البتراء أحد مناطق هذا اللواء، ومركزه مدينة وادي موسى.\nتتميز مدينة البتراء بأنها مدينة محفورة في الحجر الرملي الملون في صخور جبال وادي موسى الوردي، ولذا سُميت بـ «المدينة الوردية». ويمكن للزائر أن يصل إليها بواسطة السيارة وبعدها يبدأ في السير بين جنبات مدينة ضخمة محفورة في الصخر، ومختبئة خلف حاجز منيع من الجبال المتراصة التي بالكاد يسهل اختراقها يطلق عليه اسم السيق.\n\nالجيولوجيا\nمن أهم المظاهر الجيولوجية في مناطق البتراء؛ التكشفات الصخرية والتي تبين معظم الفترات والعصور والأعمار على السلم الجيولوجي، لتأثر المنطقة بعمليات تكتونية ناجمة عن حركة انفتاح وتوسع صدع البحر الميت، حيث تتكشف صخور القاعدة الجرانيتية في وادي نملة شمال غرب منطقة بيضاء البترا، والتي تعود إلى فترات ما قبل الكامبري بعمر 650 مليون سنة.\nتمتاز منطقة البتراء بتكشفات الصخور الرسوبية والرمال التي تتكون من فتات معادن الفلدسبار وغيرها والتي تعود للعصر الكامبري والأوردوفيشي، حيث ترسّبت في بيئات نهرية أدت إلى نقلها وترسيبها آنذاك، ومن ثم وللأعلى تتكشف مباشرة صخور العصر الكريتاسي وبوجود عدم توافق ترسيبي يفسر بعمليات؛ زوال صخور عصور معروفة كالسيلوري والجوراسي وانقطاع في الترسيب في تلك العصور. توجد أيضا تراكيب جيولوجية مثالية كالصدوع والطيات، والمقاطع الجيولوجية المثالية التي تتجمل بألوان زاهية، إضافة الينابيع والكهوف الطبيعية، والأحافير الممثلة لكافة العصور الجيولوجية. من أهم التراكيب الجيولوجية في البترا هي؛ صدع وادي موسى، حيث تأثرت المنطقة بصدع رأسي اتجاهه شمال- جنوب؛ وهو أحد الصدوع الرئيسية في جنوب الأردن. وتعمل سلطة إقليم البترا على التمهيد من أجل إطلاق مشروع السياحة الجيولوجية من خلال التعاون مع سلطة المصادر الطبيعية الأردنية، وتعد هذه التجربة الأولى من نوعها في المملكة.\n\nالحياة البرية\nينتشر شجر العرعر الفينيقي في البتراء كونها امتدادا لمناطق تواجده في المشرق العربي. وهو نوع نباتي شجري من جنس العرعر يتبع الفصيلة السروية.\nتقع البتراء في جنوب بلاد الشام، حيث وادي عربة وصحراء النقب. تعيش في هذه البيئات أنواع عشبية حولية ومعمرة. توجد كثير من الأنواع البصيلية والدرنية مثل العنصل والبلفية (باللاتينية: Bellevalia) من الفصيلة الهليونية والعصفلدين من الفصيلة الزانثورية. وتوجد عدة أنواع من الحثرة (باللاتينية: Boerhavia) ومن الصدح (باللاتينية: Commicarpus) من الفصيلة الشّبّيّة (باللاتينية: Nyctaginaceae).\n\nتتميز منطقة النقب ببعض الأنواع التي تعد امتداداً للغطاء النباتي في إفريقيا. من هذه الأنواع العشار الباسق (باللاتينية: Calotropis procera) وأربعة أنواع من السنط أحدها السنط الملتوي (باللاتينية: Acacia tortilis). كذلك، توجد أجناس نباتية تتواجد في معظم البيئات الشامية المذكورة أعلاه مثل السوسن الذي ينتشر منه أكثر من ثلاثين نوعًا تتوزع على مختلف مناطق الشام حسب تأقلم كل نوع منها. كذلك ينتشر أكثر من خمسين نوعًا من جنس الثوم (الفصيلة الثومية) وأربعين من القنطريون (الفصيلة النجمية) في مناطق الشام المختلفة من مرعش إلى سيناء وسبعة وثلاثون نوعا من الأربيان من الفصيلة النجمية.\nأما بالنسبة للحيوانات، فيعيش في البتراء كل من الجمال والخيول والماعز والحمير لتحملها حرارة الأجواء ولتكيفها مع بيئتها الجافة.\n\nالمناخ\nالتاريخ\nيعود الفضل في بناء البتراء إلى الأنباط، إلا أنه قبل الأنباط كان يعيش في هذه المنطقة شعب يدعى الآدوميين الذين كانوا في حالة عداء دائم مع الدول المجاورة لهم. وقد استوطن الأدميون التلال المحيطة بالبتراء من 1200 – 539 ق. م ولم يدخلوا البتراء بل فضّلوا الأقامة على التلال المحيطة بها، ولم يكن لديهم المام أو اهتمام بالنحت أو البناء في الصخر، بل كانت براعتهم محصورة في صناعة الفخاريات التي يبدو أنهم نقلوها إلى العرب الأنباط الذين استقروا في هذه المنطقة بعد هجرتهم من الجزيرة العربية في نهاية القرن السادس قبل الميلاد. لقد احتل الآدوميون جزءاً هاماً من المنطقة التي كانت عند تقاطع عدة طرق تجارية مهمة واستفادوا كثيرًا من القوافل التجارية التي كانت تمر عبر طرقهم. ويُعتقد بأن الآدوميين قد هزمهم اليهود بقيادة الملك سليمان الذين بسطوا سيطرتهم على هذه المنطقة لمدة مائتي عام. بعد ذلك قام البابليون بغزو فلسطين، وأخذوا اليهود وأخذوهم أسرى. وبدأ الآدوميون الذين طُردوا من هذه المنطقة بالتحرك لإعادة احتلال الأراضي التي كانت فيما مضى خاضعة لسيطرتهم. ومع ذلك فقد اجتاح الأنباط هذه المنطقة مرة أخرى وهم قبيلة بدوية ينحدرون من أصول عربية. تعايش الأنباط مع الأدوميين في حياة أكثر استقرارًا.\n\nالعرب الأنباط\nكانت البتراء عاصمة لدولة الأنباط وأهم مدن مملكتهم العربية التي دامت ما بين 400 ق.م وحتى 106 م، وقد امتدت حدودها من ساحل عسقلان في فلسطين غربًا وحتى صحراء بلاد الشام شرقًا، ومن الشمال دمشق وحتى البحر الأحمر جنوبًا. في عام 300 قبل الميلاد، كان الأنباط قد حققوا السيطرة التامة على المنطقة، وبنوا لأنفسهم مستعمرة حضرية، حيث قاموا بنحت أحيائهم السكنية ومبانيهم وقبورهم في الصخور بجانب الجبال. وفي أوج ازدهارهم في القرن الأول قبل الميلاد كان يعيش في مدينة البتراء مايقارب 30,000 نسمة، كان يحكمهم ملك منذ العام 168 قبل الميلاد وأنشأوا دولة تمثل ديمقراطية، حيث كان الملك عرضة للمحاسبة عن كل أفعاله.\nشكل موقع البتراء المتوسط بين حضارات بلاد ما بين النهرين وبلاد الشام والجزيرة العربية ومصر أهمية أقتصادية، فقد أمسكت دولة الأنباط بزمام التجارة بين حضارات هذه المناطق وسكانها وكانت القوافل التجارية تصل إليها محملة بالتوابل والبهارات من جنوب الجزيرة العربية والحرير من غزة ودمشق والحناء من عسقلان والزجاجيات من صور وصيدا واللؤلؤ من الخليج العربي.\n\nكان الأنباط في البتراء يتكلمون لغة تشبه الآرامية. وقد أصبحت البتراء عاصمة ثقافية موازية ومساوية للمدن الفينيقية واليونانية، حيث يُعتقد أن الخط العربي الأبجدي قد نشأ وتطور في هذه المنطقة، على يد الأنباط العرب. كما كُتب به الحرف العبري في مرحلة ما. وقد انتشر الحرف النبطي بعد أن تبناه الإسلام، وكُتبت به لغات أمم أخرى في بلاد عدة لا يقل مجموعها عن خمسة عشر. لقد أنتج الأنباط أواني فخارية جميلة، ومباني عظيمة تأثر معظمها فيما بعد بالأسلوب الروماني. في بداية القرن الأول الميلادي، أصبحت مدينة البتراء مركز التجارة مجدداً بسبب الحروب الدائمة بين مصر وسورية. وخلال وقت قصير، أصبح الأنباط أثرياء وأقوياء بما في الكفاية ليبسطوا سيطرتهم على المنطقة. ولكونهم زادوا ثراءً تحسن أسلوب حياتهم، وهو ما انعكس بدوره على الديكورات الفخمة الموجودة على قبور الأنباط الجدد.\nاستطاع العرب الأنباط في البدايات، مقاومة محاولات السيطرة عليهم وإخضاعهم، وأبقوا منطقة دائرة الأردن التاريخية خالية نسبيا من النفوذ الأجنبي. ومن بين أهم مواجهاتهم العسكرية، وقوفهم في وجه النفوذ السلوقي (اليوناني) في عام 312 ق.م. إذ استطاعوا رد الجيش اليوناني مهزومًا بعد أن قتلوا معظم أفراده في الحملة الأولى، وردوا الحملة اليونانية الثانية بعد أن حاصر الإغريق مدينتهم لمدة طويلة. كذلك انتصر الأنباط في أول معركة بحرية يخوضها جيش عربي، وذلك في مياه البحر الميت، وهي المعركة التي أنهت أحلام اليونان وأطماعهم بالاستيلاء على شرق الأردن. كما واجه العرب الأنباط اليهود في مواجهات واسعة سجلوا في معظمها الانتصار رغم الحماية الرومانية التي كانوا يتمتعون فيها.\n\nالرومان والبيزنطيون\nغزا الجنرال الروماني بومباي المملكة النبطية في نحو عام 60 قبل الميلاد، إلا أنه سمح بقدر من الحكم الذاتي فيها. ولقد كانت نهاية دولة الأنباط على يد الرومان عندما حاصروها ومنعوا عنها مصادر المياه سنة 106، حتى ضموها لإمبراطوريتهم، وأطلقوا عليها اسم مقاطعة \"Arabia Petraea\"، وعاصمتها البتراء.\nوكان الأنباط قد حققوا أرباحًا كبيرة من التجارة الرومانية والهندية والعربية على أراضيهم. إلا أن استيلاء الرومان على البتراء جعلهم يسيطرون على هذه الطرق. وقد بدأ الرومان ببناء وتشييد أبنيتهم الخاصة في البتراء وأقاموا في المدينة مدرجاً، كما قاموا بتشييد معبد قصر البنت، وهو البناء الوحيد الذي ما زال قائماً في قلب المدينة حيث كان يقع السوق الكبير. وفي هذا المكان كانت القوافل تقايض القوافل الأخرى القادمة من الغرب بالتوابل والعاج والعنبر والقماش. استمرت البتراء مركزًا تجاريًا مهمًا لمدة قرنين آخرين من الزمن. وبعد ذلك تضاءلت أهميتها مع استمرار بعض المدن في الشمال مثل تدمر بجذب التجارة إليها. وبالتدريج غادر التجار وغادرت معهم جيوش الرومان التي كانت مهمتها حماية الطرق التجارية. وبعد تحول الإمبراطورية الرومانية إلى الديانة المسيحية، حظيت البتراء بمطرانية، وتحولت بعض أبنيتها إلى كنائس. لكن المدينة التي حكمها البيزنطيون، فقدت مجدها السابق ولم يتبق منها إلا الأطلال. ويبدو أن المسيحية قد دخلت البتراء قبل وخلال الفترة المبكرة من العصر البيزنطي، رغم انتشار الوثنية جنبًا إلى جنب معها، حيث كانت الكنائس والمعابد الوثنية موجودة حتى القرن الخامس.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nأصبح من تبقى من سكان البتراء يعتاشون على الزراعة قبل وصول الإسلام للشام، وتحديدًا في سنة 636، لكن الزلزال الذي ضربها سنة 746 و 748 وزلازل أخرى قامت بإفراغها من أهلها. وقد ورد ذكر منطقة البتراء وجوارها في المصادر التاريخية المعاصرة للحروب الصليبية. وتشير هذه المصادر إلى أن وادي موسى كانت منطقة خصبة، وبها مياه وفيرة، كما تشير الوثائق التي تعود لهذه الفترة إلى وجود كنيسة في منطقة جبل هارون. وقد قام الصليبيون بحملة عسكرية على البتراء ووادي موسى تألفت من الفرسان والمشاة في نهاية عام 1100 وبقيادة ملك الفرنجة بالدوين الأول. وقد شيّدوا فيها قلعتين بعد ذلك. كما بنى المماليك مقاما للنبي هارون في البتراء على جبل يرتفع 1353 متر عن سطح البحر، في سياق اهتمامهم بالمقامات والقبور. ولكن المدينة دخلت في سبات طويل في الفترة العثمانية، وحتى إعادة اكتشافها في عام 1812.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nمع بدء رحلات المستشرقين للوطن العربي في القرن التاسع عشر، اكتشف البتراء عام 1812م المستشرق السويسري يوهان لودفيغ بركهارت، الذي تعلم اللغة العربية ودرس الإسلام في سوريا وجاء إلى البتراء مدعيًا بأنه مسلم من الهند بعد أن تنكّر بزي إسلامي، وهدفه تقديم أضحية إلى النبي هارون؛ وبذلك سمح له السكان المحليون بالدخول إلى المدينة الوردية. وقد احتوى كتابه المطبوع عام 1828 والمعروف باسم «رحلات في سوريا والديار المقدسة» على صور للبتراء.\nتطورت أهمية البتراء إداريًا مع نشوء إمارة شرق الأردن في عام 1921، حيث تأسست مديرية ناحية في وادي موسى. وفي عام 1973 رفعت الوحدة الإدارية من ناحية إلى قضاء. في عام 1996 رُفعت إلى لواء. في عام 2001 تغير اسم لواء وادي موسى إلى لواء البتراء. وتعتبر مدينة وادي موسى مركز اللواء.\nنفًّذت مديرية المصادر التراثية الأردنية 22 حفرية أثرية مع عدد من البعثات الغربية اُنجزت في منطقتيّ البترا والبيضا. وقد وُضعت مدينة البتراء منذ عام 1985 ضمن قائمة اليونسكو لمواقع التراث العالمي، نظرًا لتفرد المدينة من الناحية الطبيعية والتاريخية والجغرافية، ولاحتوائها على مزيج فريد من تراث الحضارات القديمة التي تنتمي إلى حضارات متنوعة يذكر منها آثار الآدوميين، واليونانيين، والأنباط، والرومان، والبيزنطيين، والصليبين، والمماليك. ومنذ ذلك التاريخ عقدت عدة ورش عمل، عنيت بترميم وحماية آثار البتراء. وتأسست في عام 1992 اللجنة الوطنية لحماية البتراء في المجلس الأعلى للعلوم والتكنولوجيا، وقامت جمعيات غير حكومية أعلنت برامج في هذا المجال. وقد وصل عدد زوار البتراء الإجمالي في عام 2010 إلى 900,000 زائر، مقتربًا من الطاقة الاستيعابية القصوى لمحمية البتراء الأثرية والبالغة 1.13 مليون\nزائر حسب تقديرات منظمة اليونسكو.\nوقد اختيرت البتراء في 7 تموز/ يوليو 2007 ثانية عجائب الدنيا السبع الجديدة، بعد الدعم الرسمي للتصويت، حيث اُعتبر الأمر واجبًا وطنيًا. وقامت الحكومة الأردنية بحملات دعائية ضخمة من أجل البتراء في الصحف الأردنية والإذاعة الأردنية والتلفزيون الأردني لتحفّز مواطني المملكة على التصويت. وبدأت الشركات بإطلاق الحملات لدعم التصويت.\nكما تأسس في البتراء عام 2009، سلطة ذات استقلال مالي وإداري، هي سلطة إقليم البترا التنموي السياحي. والتي تهدف إلى تنمية الإقليم وتطويره سياحيًا واقتصاديًا واجتماعيًا وثقافيًا، والمساهمة في تنمية المجتمع المحلي.\n\nالعمارة\nتأثرت العمارة النبطية عمومًا، وعمارة البتراء خصوصًا، بفن العمارة المصرية والآشورية والإغريقية. ويظهر هذا جلّيًا في كثير من مباني العمارة الجنائزية المتمثلة بالمقابر الملكية المنحوتة، والمقابر المبنية بالحجر المقطوع. لقد اهتم الأنباط اهتمامًا كبيرًا بمقابرهم، مما إنعكس في عمارتها التي حُشد فيها الكثير من الفنون المعمارية والفنية ومما يوحي باهتمام الأنباط «بالحياة الآخرة» بالنسبة للأموات. وبالنسبة للمقابر الملكية المنحوتة، فتُعتبر من أكثر ما أشتهر به الأنباط. وقد أُجريت عليها العديد من الدراسات المتخصصة أظهرت أن المهندس النبطي جمع بين التأثيرات الخارجية من الحضارات المجاورة مع الذوق النبطي. ويمكن مشاهدة الكثير من هذه القبور في أماكن مختلفة من البتراء وما حولها وخصوصًا في الطريق قبل الوصول إلى السيق. من قبور البتراء الشهيرة: قبر «المسلات» وقبر «الجرة» و «القبر ذو النوافذ».\nتتسم عمارة الأنباط باستخدم العديد من المواد حسب توفرها في البيئة، فبالإضافة إلى نحت الصخور الرملية والكلسية وجعلها مساكن ومنشآت وقبور وتماثيل وغيرها، فقد استخدمت كل أنواع الحجارة في البناء النبطي حيثما فرضت البيئة ذلك، ففي الصحراء مثلا، جرى استخدام الحجارة البازلتية السوداء لمختلف أغراض البناء. وفي معظم الأبنية الكبيرة كالمعابد استخدمت فنون معمارية كثيرة منها الأقواس الكبيرة والصغيرة التي تعتمد على تراص الحجارة لا على المونة أو الدعم الأرضي بالأعمدة، وفي بعض الحالات جرى سقف بعض الأبنية أو الحجرات بصفوف متلاصقة من هذه الحجارة قبل أن تجري تغطيتها بالملاط الطيني من فوقها لدرء أمطار الشتاء ولعزل حرارة الصيف أيضًا. وبالنسبة للمواد الأخرى المساعدة، فقد استخدمت الأخشاب في التسقيف وصناعة الأبواب والشبابيك، ويبدو ذلك في منطقة وادي موسى والبتراء بسبب توفر الأشجار في المنطقة. وعرف الأنباط استخداما آخر للأخشاب في البناء من شأنه تعزيز صمود الجدران أمام الهزات الأرضية، حيث عثر على بقايا تلك الأخشاب في بعض الأبنية منها بناء «قصر البنت» في البتراء.\nمن جهة أخرى، يُعتبر النظام الهندسي للماء الإنجاز الأهم للحضارة النبطية بالمدينة، والذي جعل الحياة ممكنة في هذه المنطقة الجافة من الصحراء الأردنية. وقد تضمن ذلك النظام أنظمة لحفظ المياه واشتمل على السدود التي كانت تجمع مياه الأمطار في أشهر الشتاء. كما استخدم الأنباط نظاماً محكماً من القنوات والأنابيب الفخارية لتوزيع المياه في كافة أنحاء المدينة.\nالتخطيط الحضري\n\nلقد بُنيت مباني البتراء وفق مخطط المدينة العام، حيث الشارع الرئيس الذي تأثر بمخطط المدينة الرومانية، إذ أن الشارع يكاد يقسم المدينة إلى نصفين، وهو يحاذي الوادي مما اضطر المهندس النبطي لبناء بعض القنوات تحت أرض الشارع. وكذلك العبارات والأقواس الحجرية التي ترتفع عن سيل الوادي في فصل الشتاء. وما يزال بالإمكان ملاحظة بعض آثار هذه المرافق في الشارع الرئيسي بعد الانتهاء من ساحة الخزنة.\nيُعد الشارع المُعمد من أهم شوارع مدينة البتراء، حيث قام الأنباط بتشييده، ثم أعاد الرومان بنائه في عام 106 بعد احتلالهم للبتراء. يبلغ عرضه 6 أمتار، وقد كانت تقوم على جانبيه مباني من طابق واحد إلى طابقين، كما يوجد على يسار الشارع المعمد باتجاه الجنوب مجموعة من السلالم تقود لساحة مكشوفة تسمى بـ «السوق»، حيث كانت تجري كافة أنواع النشاطات والمعاملات التجارية. وعلى ما يبدو أن هذه المنطقة كانت القلب النابض للمدينة ومركز النشاطات التجارية المختلفة منذ القرن الثالث ق.م. وقد استمر استعمال الشارع خلال الفترة البيزنطية في القرنين الرابع والخامس وحتى السادس.\nيوجد في المدينة أيضًا أحد الطرق المشهورة، وهو شارع الواجهات. ويقع بالقرب من منطقة الخزنة، حيث يبدأ السيق بالاتساع تدريجيًا حيث يصل الزوار إلى منطقة مفتوحة وعلى الجانبين يوجد عددًا من واجهات المدافن النبطية المزينة بالمسننات والكورنيشات والأدراج المقلوبة. ولقد دُمر بعض هذه الواجهات بفعل العوامل الطبيعية، وربما تعود هذه الواجهات إلى موظفين كبار في الدولة أو بعض الأمراء.\n\nالمواقع الأثرية داخل البتراء\nاكتشف نحو 3,000 معلم أثري في البتراء، تشكل منها المعالم المعروفة نحو 800 معلمًا، أهمها:\n\nالسيق\nهو الطريق الرئيس المؤدي لمدينة البتراء. وهو شق صخري يتلوّى بطول نحو 1200 متر وبعرض يتراوح من 3 - 12 متر، ويصل ارتفاعه إلى نحو 80 متر. يُعتبر الجزء الأكبر منه طبيعي، بالإضافة إلى جزء آخر نحته الأنباط. ينتهي السيق في الجهة المقابلة للخزنة.\nيُمكن مشاهدة بقايا لقوس يمثل بوابة المدينة في بداية السيق، الذي يوجد على جانبيه قنوات لجر المياه ممتدة من عيون وادي موسى في الخارج إلى المدينة في الداخل. كما يمكن مشاهدة السدود الجانبية، التي أقيمت في مكان السدود النبطية الأصلية، لمنع تدفق المياه إلى السيق، وحجزها والاستفادة منها. لقد كانت أرضية السيق مبلطة ببلاطات حجرية جزء منها يمكن مشاهدته في مكانه الأصلي. وقد زُينت جوانب السيق بالمنحوتات النبطية ومعظمها منحوتات تمثل آلهة. وتوجد تماثيل الآلهة ومحاريبها قريبة جداً من هذه القنوات بل وملاصقة لها أحيانا، لاعتقاد الأنباط وإيمانهم الشديد بأن المياه مقدسة.\nيمكن أيضا مشاهدة مجموعة من المنحوتات على الجانب الأيسر من السيق تُعرف باسم «أصنام سابينوس»، وقد سُمّيت هذه المجموعة بهذا الاسم لوجود نقش باليونانية تحت الحنية الثانية على يسار الزائر وهو متجه لآخر السيق. يشير النقش إلى أن سابينوس ابن الإسكندر المقدوني، والذي جاء من درعا، أمر بنحت هذه الحنيات أو المحاريب تمجيداً للآلهة النبطية. ومن المنحوتات المهمة أيضا بقايا منحوتات لجمال ورجل تمثل قافلة تجارية، حيث اشتهر الأنباط بالتجارة، وكانت أحد أسباب ثرائهم الواسع.\n\nالخزنة\nيُعتبر مبنى الخزنة المنحوتة في الصخر، أشهر معالم البتراء وأكثرها أهمية، حيث اختار الأنباط موقعها بعناية ليكون أول معلم يواجه الزائر بعد دخول المدينة. وقد سُمّيت بهذا الاسم لاعتقاد البدو المحليين سابقًا بأن الجرة الموجودة في أعلى الواجهة تحوي كنزًا، ولكنها في الواقع ضريح ملكي. تتكون واجهة الخزنة من طابقين بعرض 25 مترا وارتفاع 39 مترا. وقد أفرغت مئات الآف الأمتار المكعبة من الحجر الرملي من الخزنة عندما أُعيد اكتشافها في القرن التاسع عشر، لتظهر الواجهة بوضعها النهائي الحالي. ويتكون الطابق السفلي من ستة أعمدة على طول الواجهة الأمامية تقف فوق مصطبة في وسطها سلم، وتتوج الأعمدة من الأعلى بثلاثة أرباع عمود، يبلغ طول العمود في الطابق السفلي نحو 12 مترا، وفي الطابق العلوي يبلغ ارتفاعه 9 أمتار، كما يبلغ ارتفاع الجرة في الأعلى نحو 3,5 مترا.\nويظهر التناظر الكبير في الواجهة، بالإضافة إلى المزيج بين الفنون المعمارية المصرية والهلنستية مع الطابع المعماري النبطي. وحول هدف إنشاء هذا المبنى عدة آراء، فيرى بعض علماء الآثار أنه بُني معبدًا أو مكان لحفظ الوثائق، ولكن الحفريات الأثرية الحديثة في البتراء أثبتت وجود مدافن أسفل ساحة مبنى الخزنة، والتي يمكن مشاهدتها الآن من الأعلى من خلال الشبك الحديدي الموجود فوقها. كما أن هذه المدافن قُطعت لبناء الخزنة مع المحافظة عليها. وبذلك تكون الخزنة مدفنا. ويثبت مع القرن الأول الميلادي زمن الملك الحارث الرابع ملك الأنباط. وعلى الأغلب تشكل مدفناً لهذا الملك.\nويتكون مبنى الخزنة من الداخل من ثلاث حجرات، اثنتان على الجانب وواحدة في الوسط. والحجرتان الجانبيتان خاليتان عدا عن قبر حفر في الحجرة الغربية، أما الحجرة الوسطى فيصعد إليها بدرج ويبلغ طولها 12,5 متر، وعلى جوانبها الثلاث توجد حجرات صغيرة للدفن. ويوجد على جانبي مبنى الخزنة من الخارج ثقوب صغيرة على الجانبين مزدوجة في النصف الأعلى من مبنى الخزنة ربما تكون استخدمت لتثبيت السقالات أثناء عملية النحت. ويوجد في أعلى مبنى الخزنة قناة بعرض 90 سم لتصريف المياه ومنعها للنزول على هذه الواجهة. وقد قامت الحفريات الحديثة بتنظيف هذه القناة.\n\nالدير\nوهو من المباني المهمة في منطقة البتراء، ويعود تاريخه إلى النصف الأول من القرن الأول قبل الميلاد، ويتكون المبنى من طابقين، ويُعتقد أنه احتوى على تماثيل متحركة التيجان. وهو أكبر حجماً من مبنى الخزنة، حيث يصل عرضه إلى 50 مترا، أما ارتفاعه فيصل إلى 50 مترا.\nويُعتقد أن واجهة مبنى الدير قد حُوِّلت إلى دير للرهبان أثناء فترة حكم الدولة البيزنطية في بلاد الشام، وذلك لوجود أثار للصلبان المحفورة في الصخر في الغرفة الوحيدة الموجودة في الطابق السفلي من الواجهة. كما يُعتقد بأنه الساحة الواقعة أمام الواجهة قد بُلّطت.\n\nمسرح البتراء\nمن أكبر المباني في البتراء، ولقد بُني في القرن الأول للميلاد على شكل نصف دائرة بقطر 95 مترا، وبارتفاع 23 مترا. وهو منحوت في الصخر بإستثناء الجزء الأمامي منه فهو مبني، ويستوعب المسرح من 7 - 10 آلاف مشاهد، كما تتكون مقاعد المشاهدين من 45 صفًا من المقاعد المقسمة أفقيًا إلى ثلاثة أقسام، الأسفل 11 صفا والأوسط 34 صفا والعلوي 10 صفوف، وهي مقسمة أيضًا من خلال الأدراج الخمسة إلى ستة أجزاء، ويوجد فوق المدرجات قطع صخري مقطوع من بعض المدافن السابقة لبناء المسرح.\nقطعت ساحة الأوركسترا بالصخر، كما أن الممران الجانبيان للساحة مقطوعان أيضًا في الصخر ومسقفان بالحجارة على شكل عقد. أما الجدار الخلفي للمسرح فيتكون بالأصل من 3 طوابق ومزيّن بالكوات والأعمدة وواجهته مغطاة بالألواح الرخامية.\n\nقصر البنت\nيُطلق عليه أيضًا «قصر بنت فرعون»، وهو معبد نبطي من القرن الأول قبل الميلاد. وتكمن أهمية هذا القصر بأنه أحد مباني البتراء القليلة التي صمدت رغم الزلازل، وذلك بسبب طريقة بنائهِ باستخدام مداميك وضع فيها خشب العرعر، مما جعل جدرانه أكثر طواعية للحركة أثناء الزلازل. إن الحنية التي تقع على يمين الساحة الأمامية لقصر البنت كانت قد صممت أصلا لتخليد الإمبراطور الروماني وعائلته عندما احتل الرومان مدينة البتراء، حيث أن هذا التقليد معروف عند الرومان.\nوقد كان هذا المعبد مخصصًا لواحدة من الآلهة الرئيسية، ويجادل البعض أن هذه الآلهة هي اللات فيما يعتقد آخرون أنها العزى، ورأى آخرون أنه للإله الأعلى ذو الشرى. وكان من المثير للنقاش علاقة هذا المعبد بالإلهة إيزيس المعبودة المصرية، وكان ذلك من الظواهر المستغربة.\n\nالمحكمة\nهو مبنى متكون من مجموعة من الواجهات المهمة، وأولها «قبر الجرة»، ويعود تاريخه إلى النصف الأول من القرن الأول الميلادي، ويقع على الجهة المقابلة للمدرج النبطي. ويبلغ عرض الواجهة نحو 16 مترا، وبارتفاع 26 مترا. وتتكون من طابقين من الجدران التي تدعم أقواسًا تحت مستوى صالة المدفن، وهي مدمجة مع حجرات دفن جزء منها منحوت والآخر مبني. ويوجد سلم يصعد إلى ساحة المدفن في الأعلى. ويتكون المدفن من صالة مربعة الشكل بطول نحو 19 مترا. وكانت القبور في الجزء الخلفي للمدفن، ولكنه حُول إلى كنيسة في القرن الخامس الميلادي. وتوجد كتابة يونانية تذكر أن تحويل المكان إلى كنيسة عام 447 ومكتوب ذلك على الجزء الخلفي الأيسر من الجدار.\n\nالمعبد الكبير\nوهو أضخم المباني في مدينة البتراء، ويقع هذا المعبد على الجهة الجنوبية من الشارع المُعمد. ويتكون البناء من مدخل رئيسي يرتبط مع الشارع، ثم ساحة مقدسة سفلى وعلى جانبيها يوجد بنائين متطابقين على شكل نصف دائري وعلى جانبيهما توجد أدراج عريضة تؤدي إلى الساحة العليا المقدسة، وفوقها يقع المعبد أو قدس الأقداس.\n\nالمذبح\nاُستخدم هذا المبنى في فترة الصليبيين ليكون صلة وصل وربط ما بين قلعتي الوعيرة والحبيس. أما المذبح نفسه، فأصوله آدومية. وبعد الاحتفالات التي كانت تجرى في المدرج كانت المواكب الدينية تصعد إلى المذبح من المنطقة المجاورة للمدرج مرورًا بوادي المحافر حتى تصل للمذبح حيث تقدم القرابين التي كانت حيوانية والمذبح يتكون من ساحة مركزية محاطة بمقاعد من ثلاث جهات. إن أول ما يمكن رؤيته في هذه المنطقة هو مسلتان مقطوعتان في الصخر ويعتقد بأنهما يرمزان لأهم آلهة الأنباط ذو الشرى ورفيقته الدائمة العزى. كما يُشاهد في منطقة الدرج الصاعد للمذبح بقايا جدران وبرج يُعتقد بأن أساساته آدومية أعيد استخدامه في الفترة النبطية. ويوجد في الجهة الغربية مذبحين أحدهما مستطيل الشكل ربما استخدم لعملية الطواف، والآخر دائري الشكل يُعتقد أنه كان يستخدم لوضع دماء القرابين أو النبيذ كما يحتوي هذا المعلم على بركة أو خزان ماء صغير ويمكن مشاهدة الجزء السفلي للمدينة من هذا الموقع.\n\nمواقع أخرى\nيوجد المدينة الكثير من المعالم الأخرى ذات الوظائف المختلفة، منها ضريح الجندي الروماني وقاعة الاحتفالات الجنائزية. ويعتقد بوجود ساحة مركزية بين هذين المعلمين. أما القاعة الجنائزية فقد تميزت عن غيرها بوجود دعامات منحوتة وملتصقة بالجدران وحنى مستطيلة طولية الشكل خلف المقاعد مباشرةً، أما ضريح الجندي الروماني فربما اُعيد استخدامه بعد 106 م وذلك لوجود ثلاثة تماثيل ذات رداء عسكري روماني موضوعة في حنايا هذه الواجهة.\nكما تحوي البتراء عددًا من المعابد الصغيرة في البتراء مثل معبد الأسود المجنحة، ومعبد البستان. بالنسبة لمعبد الأسود المجنحة، فيقع على الجهة المقابلة لمبنى قصر البنت، ويتكون بناء المعبد من شرفة أمامية تتقدمها الأعمدة بطول 9,5 متر. ويجري الدخول منها عبر بوابة عريضة إلى قاعة المعبد الرئيسية وهي مربعة الشكل وتحيط بها الأعمدة. وكانت تاجيات بعض أعمدة المعبد تحمل أسودًا مجنحةً ومن هنا جاءت تسمية المعبد. وقد بُلطت أرضية القاعة الرئيسة برخام أبيض مموج بالبني بينما بلطت المنصة بالرخام الأبيض والأسود وزخرفت جدران المعبد الداخلية بالرخام والقصارة الملونة والجض وعثر على قطع جصية بأشكال رؤوس آدمية وأقنعه مسرحية وأشكال أزهار كانت مثبته على الجدران. وقد دُمر المعبد والمنشآت المحيطة به بزلزال عام 363 م. أما بالنسبة لمعبد البستان، فيتميز بوجود جدار ضخم بجواره يقوم عليه الجزء الجنوبي للشرفة العلوية وبقايا غرف يبدو أن إحداها كانت معقودة يتخلل جدرانها إحدى عشر حنية.\nومن المباني الجنائزية الأخرى في المدينة، قبر المسلات، مدفن الحرير، مدفن سكستوس فلورنتينوس، قبر القصر، القبر الكورنثي،  وقبر الرينيسانس.\n\nالسكان\nبلغ عدد سكان لواء البتراء (الذي تشكل مدينة البتراء جزءاً منه) في عام 2009 نحو 28,760 نسمة، معظمهم من البدو. وكانت قبائل من «عرب اللياثنة» قد استوطنت المكان أثناء إعادة اكتشاف الغرب للبتراء في القرن التاسع عشر. كما كانت عشائر مختلفة تسكن البتراء منذ خمسينيات القرن العشرين، كعشائر «العمارين» و «البدول»، حيث كانوا يسكنون في كهوف داخل البتراء حتى عام 1985، حين رحّلتهم الحكومة الأردنية إلى إسكانات خارج المدينة الأثرية كبلدة «البيضاء» التي تبعد عن البترا نحو 10 كم. ويُقدر عددهم من 1,000 - 3,000 شخص يتقن الكثير منهم العديد من اللغات الأجنبية رغم أميّة الكثير منهم، بسبب اختلاطهم بالسيّاح الأجانب.\nوقد أدرج المجال الثقافي لبدو البتراء ووادي رم في 25 تشرين الثاني/ نوفمبر 2005 إلى قائمة اليونسكو لروائع التراث الثقافي اللامادي الإنساني. ويقع هذا المجال البدوي الصحراوي قرب مدينة البتراء، داخل منطقة جبلية شبه قاحلة ومساحات صحراوية. وهو مجال تمارس فيه مجموعة من الممارسات والمهارات الثقافية اللامادية، المرتبطة بالحياة الرعوية التقليدية. فقد حافظ بدو البتراء ووادي الرم على معرفة مميزة في مجال الثروة النباتية والحيوانية، وفي حقل الطب التقليدي، وتربية الجمال وحياكة الخيام والترحال وتسلّق الجبال. وهو ما يقع تناقله عبر الأجيال شفويا وبالممارسة. بالإضافة إلى غيرها من الأشكال الثقافية كالأساطير والشعر والحكايات الشعبية والأغاني.\n\nالنشاط الاقتصادي\nشكّل معدن النحاس، عصب الحياة الاقتصادية وعنصرًا هامًا في تدعيم نفوذ وقوة حضارة الأنباط. وامتدت أراضي المملكة النبطية عبر مساحات واسعة، فكان تحت نفوذها أراضي وادي ضانا، حيث أقيم أقدم مناجم للنحاس في العالم، وهي مناجم النحاس في وادي فنان. إضافة إلى صناعة الفخار، حيث يعتبر الفخار النبطي من أفضل وأدق الفخار الذي صنع في العالم، لما عرف من منظر وإتقان. وهو رقيق جدًا لدرجة أنه يُطلق عليه «قشرة البيض».\n\nوقد اشتهر الأنباط بالتجارة، وكانت مدينة البتراء محط استراحة للقوافل التجارية. وهذا ما جعل أنتيجونوس - أحد قادة الإسكندر المقدوني - بغزو الأنباط في عام 312 ق.م. ومع مرور الزمن أصبح الأنباط يتمتعون بكيان ونفوذ كبيرين في المنطقة وأزدهر فن المعمار والبناء وسك العملات وصناعة الفخار وفنون النحت وغيرها. وتعكس عاصمتهم مدينة البتراء تلك الفنون في أجمل صورها.\n\nاستطاع الأنباط تطوير طرق الزراعة الجافة والحصاد المائي، مما يعكس قدرة الإنسان النبطي على التكيف مع ظروف الحياة الجافة وتطويع الطبيعة، ففنون الزراعة الجافة وطرق الحصاد المائي ما زالت مستخدمة حتى الوقت الحاضر، ومما يجدر ذكره أن العديد من العلماء الغربين استطاعوا نقل التقنيات النبطية القديمة والمستخدمة في الزراعة الجافة والحصاد المائي ويرجع الفضل بهذا حقيقة إلى الأنباط.\nأما حاليًا، فتُعتبر البتراء أهم المواقع السياحية جذبًا للسياح على مستوى الأردن، وبذا لها عائد اقتصادي كبير على البلاد. كما تشكل البتراء اليوم، عمق الأردن الحضاري، وجانبًا هامًا من مضمون مزيج الهوية التاريخية لهذا البلد. كما تحتل هذه المدينة التاريخية اليوم، المرتبة الأولى أردنيًا من حيث خلق العمالة المحلية ومنطقة جذب سياحي للمشاريع المحلية المدرة للدخل ومنطقة جذب للقطاع الخاص، كما أنها شكلت فئة متوسطة بالنسبة للبيئة والمشاريع الحكومية.\n\nالسياحة\nتضم البتراء عددًا كبيرًا من الفنادق ذات تصنيف خمس نجوم وما دون لاستيعاب الأعداد الكبيرة من الزائرين لمحمية الآثار في المدينة، حيث بلغ عددهم قرابة 480,000 زائر في عام 1999، فيما ارتفع العدد إلى 900,000 عام 2010. كما تحوي هذه المحمية بدورها على عدد كبير من الأسواق الشرقية. من الجدير بالذكر أن جرش تلي مدينة البتراء من حيث عدد الزوار، تليهما كل من المناطق التالية تنازليًا: عجلون ومادبا والكرك وأم قيس ووادي رم. في عام 2019، احتفلت المدينة باستقبال الزائر رقم مليون لأول مرة في تاريخها، في حدث اعتُبر محطة فارقة في مسيرة السياحة الأردنية. وقد نُظمت فعاليات احتفالية بهذه المناسبة.\nمن جهة أخرى، افتتح في نيسان/ أبريل 1994 متحف البتراء النبطي في المدينة إلى جانب متحف آخر هو متحف البتراء القديم، الذي تأسس عام 1963. ويحتوي المتحف النبطي ما يقارب 600 قطعة أثرية معروضة في خزائن العرض؛ حيث يتألف من ثلاث قاعات رئيسية: القاعة الأولى تشتمل شرحاً عن تاريخ الأنباط وجيولوجية البتراء، بالإضافة إلى قطع أثرية تعود إلى العصر الحجري الحديث. أما القاعة الثانية، فهي مخصصة للمكتشفات من الحفريات الأثرية، ومرتبة حسب تسلسلها الزمني بدءاً من العصرالحجري وحتى القرن السادس الميلادي. كما تضم هذه القاعة نبذة تاريخية عن الزلازل والتجارة النبطية وطرق القوافل والبتراء في العصور الوسطى. أما القاعة الثالثة، فتحتوي على مجموعة من الأسرجة الفخارية حسب تطور صناعتها، والتماثيل البرونزية والفخارية والأطبـاق الملونة والعادية وقطع العملات، والحلي والمجوهرات، بالإضافة لبعض القطع الفخارية والجرار المختلفة الأحجام.\nيُقام في البتراء سنويًا ومنذ عام 2005، مهرجان البتراء السياحي الثقافي، لتشجيع السياحة الداخلية والعربية. كما أُقيم في نفس العام مؤتمر للحائزين على جائزة نوبل في العالم. ولقد قامت سلطة إقليم البترا بالتعاون مع هيئة تنشيط السياحة في عام 2012، بإحياء احتفاليات تضم العديد من الأنشطة والفعاليات، بمناسبة مرور 200 عامًا على اكتشاف البتراء، والتي تهدف إلى تعريف المواطن المحلي والسائح العربي والأجنبي بأهمية هذه المناسبة ودورها الريادي في وضع البتراء على خارطة السياحة العالمية.\n\nأهمية دينية\nللمدينة أهمية دينية وتاريخية للديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث. يعتقد اليهود أنها تحتوي على أهم وأثمن سر في تاريخهم، وهو تابوت العهد، الذي يحتوي على الوصايا العشر التي أعطاها الله لموسى، بالإضافة إلى وجود عصا هارون فيه. يوجد مقام هارون في البتراء وعلى أحد قممها المطلّة على المدينة الأثرية بارتفاع 1353 متر عن سطح البحر، مقام النبي هارون . وهو مسجد مملوكي صغير، ذو غرفة مُزينة بأقمشة خضراء تعلوها قبة بيضاء وأمامه حجر أسود. بُني المقام في سياق اهتمام المماليك بالمقامات والقبور. كما يدعي بعض اليهود أنهم هم من بنو البتراء، حيث يعتقدون أن التوراة قد أشارت إلى أن من انشأ هذه المدينة هم سلالة النبي «نابوت» الابن الأكبر للنبي إسماعيل. كما يعتقدون أن اسم البتراء القديم «سالع» هو كلمة عبرية معناها «صخرة»، حيث إنها تُرجمت في العدد الثالث من نبوة عوبديا: «تكبر قلبك قد خدعك أيها الساكن في محاجئ الصخر». ويرجحون أنها حيثما تذكر في التوراة، فإنها تشير إلى عاصمة أدوم، المدينة الحصينة في وادي موسى التي اشتهرت باسم «البتراء» (والتي تعني «صخرة» باللغة اليونانية). وبقد بدأ اليهود بزيارة البتراء بشكل ملحوظ، بعد إتفاقية وادي عربة.\nمن جهة أخرى، ذُكر مقام هارون بالبتراء أيضًا في مخطوطات الكنيسة البيزنطية التي تعود إلى القرن السادس الميلادي باسم «دير نبينا هارون»، حيث يوجد في المدينة آثار لعدد من الكنائس البيزنطية ذات الأرضيات الفسيفسائية. وتُعتبر كنيسة البتراء الرئيسية، ثاني كنيسة في البتراء بعد تحويل قبر الجرة (المحكمة) لكنيسة في عام 446. وتتكون الكنيسة من مبنى ذو 3 أروقة، بالإضافة إلى ساحة وبرج من الجهة الغربية وغرف جانبية من الشمال والشرق.\nكما كان أهالي وادي موسى المسلمون يقومون بزيارة المقام منذ زمن بعيد، حيث كان للمكان طقوسا ومناسك تُؤدى. وقد زار الظاهر بيبرس وكاتبه النويري المقام سنة 1276، ولم يتحدث النويري عن وجود بناء فوقه. أما اليوم، فيشهد فوقه مسجدًا صغيرًا كُتب على مدخله عبارة تفيد أنه عمارة هذا المسجد قد جددت في عهد السلطان الملك الناصر محمد بن قلاوون. وقد زار المقام الرحّآلة السويسري بيركهارت عام 1812 عندما أراد أن يزور البتراء ، فتذرّع بزيارة المقام وأخذ معه قربانًا ليتمكن من زيارة البتراء. ثم ذهل مما رآه عندما دخل البتراء من السيق.\n\nالبتراء في الفن\nأصبح المجتمع الغربي على علم بوجود البتراء أساسًا من خلال قصص جون وليام برغن الدينية، حين وصفها بأنها «مدينة وردية قديمة بقدم الزمن». لكنه نفسه، مثل كثير من معاصريه، لم يقوموا بزيارة البتراء أبدًا. حيث كانوا يعلمون عن البتراء عبر رسومات الليثوغرافيا التي رسمها الفنان الإسكتلندي ديفيد روبرتس للبتراء ومنطقة وادي موسى أثناء زيارته عام 1839، والتي تجاوز عددها عشرين لوحة ليثوغرافية. وقد طبع العديد منها ما أعطى البتراء شهرة عالمية . وقد نشرها في كتابه «مصر وسوريا وفلسطين» في عام 1839. في الواقع، حتى الحرب العالمية الأولى، لم تكن زيارة المدينة متاحة للأوروبيين إلا برفقة مرشدين محليين ومرافقين مسلحين . ويوجد للبتراء العديد من اللوحات والصور الأخرى التي تعود للقرن التاسع عشر مما يدل على مدى الاهتمام الذي أضفاه إعادة اكتشافها على أوروبا في ذلك الوقت. من الأعمال المشهورة للبتراء، لوحة فنية بالألوان المائية لمناظر البتراء للفنان شرانز نحو 1840 . وأول خارطة مخطوطة للبتراء باللغة الإنجليزية من رسم الرحالة لابودي نحو عام 1830، وصور من تصوير فريت عام 1830.\nفي عام 1868، شُكلت قافلة من الرسامين الفرنسيين للذهاب إلى سيناء والفيوم والبتراء، لكن النتيجة كانت مخيبة للآمال، حيث منعتهم الأمطار الغزيرة من إكمال رحلتهم. كتب الفنان البلجيكي تانتان Tintin كتابًا مصورًأ عن البتراء، ولكن موقع الصور لم يكن فيه الأردن، حيث كان في دولة افتراضية أسماها \"Khemed74\".\nوقد احتفت الكثير من المسرحيات والأعمال الدرامية الأردنية والعربية بالبتراء، كان من أهمها مسرحية بترا، التي ألّفها الأخوان رحباني، وغنتها فيروز ونصري شمس الدين وآخرين.\nكما اختيرت البتراء موقعًا لتصوير عدد من الأفلام الأمريكية والعالمية مثل أفلام إنديانا جونز والحملة الأخيرة (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) والعاطفة في الصحراء (Passion in the Desert) والمتحوّلون (Transformers)، وغيرها.\n\nتوأمة المدن\nماتيرا، إيطاليا\n بلوفديف،

      "content": "## Overview\nPetra (Arabic: البتراء, Al-Batrāʾ), the fabled \"rose red city, half as old as time\", is a well known ancient Nabataean city in the south of Jordan. Due to its breathtaking grandeur and fabulous ruins, Petra was recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985.\n\n## Understand\nPetra was the impressive capital of the Nabataean Kingdom from around the 6th century BC. The kingdom was absorbed into the Roman Empire in AD 106 and the Romans continued to expand the city. An important center for trade and commerce, Petra continued to flourish until a catastrophic earthquake destroyed buildings and crippled vital water management systems around AD 663. After Saladin's conquest of the Middle East in 1189, Petra was abandoned and the memory of it was lost to the West.\nThe ruins remained hidden to most of the world until the Swiss explorer, Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, disguised as an Arab scholar, infiltrated the Bedouin-occupied city in 1812. Burckhardt's accounts of his travels inspired other Western explorers and historians to discover the ancient city further. The most famous of these was David Roberts, a Scottish artist who created a number of accurate and detailed illustrations of the city in 1839.\nThe first real excavations of the site were in 1929 after the forming of Trans-Jordan. Since that time, Petra has become by far Jordan's largest tourist attraction, partially due to the exposure by the Steven Spielberg movie, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, in 1989. Due to the fantastic engineering accomplishments and the fact of its being well-preserved, the archaeological site was chosen in July 2007 as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.\nPetra is the archaeological site and Wadi Musa is the city nearby.\n\n## Hours\nPetra is open to visits 06:00-17:00 in winter, and 06:00-18:00 in summer, daily throughout the year.\n\n## Entry ticket\nWhat may be one of the most expensive admissions to any archaeological site in the world. The entry ticket to Petra costs 90 JD for one day visitors to Jordan (i.e., those that have arrived in Jordan from some other country, e.g. Israel, on the day of the visit and will be returning there for the night). Tourists that overnight in the country or on a cruise ship pay 50 JD for 1 day, 55 JD for 2 days or 60 JD for 3 days. Bring your passport to prove you entered Jordan at least one day before. If entered the same day, your room key will be asked by the ticket seller. Students have to pay the full price, except those who enroll in a Jordanian university, for whom the admission price drops sharply to 1 JD.\nDo not attempt to purchase tickets from dubious scalpers around town! Time permitting, the two-day pass is recommended, as there is much to see and do in Petra. For more than one day, the ticket office can ask for your passport as the ticket has your first name on it.\nThe Jordan Pass (purchased online before coming to Jordan) gives you access to over 30 sights and attractions in Jordan, including Petra, Wadi Rum Protected Area and Jerash. And the fee on the regular 40 JD visa is waived when entering Jordan, if you stay at least four days in the country. (If you leave before, you will have to pay the 40 JD at the border when exiting.) There are three different types available, depending on the length of your stay in Petra: 70, 75, or 80 JD for one, two, or three days in Petra. Also read Jordan#Jordan Pass.\nChildren under 12 years can enter the touristic sites for free when accompanied by their parents.\n\n## By bus\nJETT buses, both ordinary and all-inclusive guided tour, connect to Amman and Aqaba via the fast (but boring) Desert Highway. Other tourists come with organized groups, including daily trips from Eilat, Israel. Tours to Petra from the Egyptian cities of Taba, Sinai and Sharm el Sheikh are also gaining popularity with charter tourism.\nIt is easy to take the bus from Amman to Petra. It leaves from the JETT bus office close to Abdali station (departs at 06:30, runs daily) and in 3½ hours you'll get to the bus station not even 5 minutes from the entrance of Petra. You can also take it at the 7th Circle at around 6:45. At 17:00 the JETT bus takes off again to go back to Amman. The price is 10 JD for one way (as of May 2025).\n\n## By minibus\nThe 30.31895235.479451 Wadi Musa Bus Station is next to the mosque.\nPublic minibus from Wadi Musa (Petra) to Ma'an (or vis versa) is 0.55 JD and from there to Aqaba (or vis versa) is 1.50 JD. The main route from Wadi Musa to Aqaba or Amman (or vice versa) is overpriced for tourists! Going through Ma'an, you should be able to pay the local price for the public minibus.\nThere is a direct minibus going from Aqaba for 5 JD, for those that cross from Eilat and don't want to pay the outrageous taxi fare. The problem is, there's no timetable - it leaves early in the morning (06:45) from Wadi Musa towards Aqaba, then returns from Aqaba when it fills up etc. Ask at the tourist information right at the border for information of departures.\nThere are also direct minibuses from Amman - these leave when full, and tourists are charged 7 JD (March 2023) to get on. Do not allow the drivers to charge you for your luggage, as they might sometimes try to do. The ride is about three hours.\nThe minibus from Wadi Rum costs 10 JD. It takes around 2 hours to get to Petra. Have your tour operator or guide call the bus owner the day before to arrange an exact time for pick up. The bus usually leaves from Wadi Rum at 09:30 in the morning, but may be delayed due to weather or tour groups coming the other way.\nThere was a daily bus to Wadi Musa from Madaba, via the scenic (but slow) King's Highway, but as of 2025, it is not running anymore. The Mariam Hotel can however organise a shared taxi for you. The price is 85 JD for the taxi and you will have to find the people that can share it with you.\n\n## By taxi\nTaxi is also a viable option. For 75 JD or less (depending on how much you haggle) you may be able to get a private taxi from Amman to Petra and back, including the driver waiting around for 6 hr.\nA taxi from Aqaba to Petra should cost 55 JD one-way. Though, see the remark on the Aqaba border taxi Mafia under Aqaba.\nRenting a minibus with a driver in the hotel at the Dead Sea would be around 140 JD one-way.\nA taxi from Madaba to Petra arranged by a hotel costs 60-65 JD (Oct 2018). Arranging one directly may cost less.\n\n## By tour company\nMany visitors to Petra come on day trips from Eilat, in Israel. Single day tours cost around US$220 per person, including park admission, but not including Israel border fees (2015). A bus driver picks you up at your hotel around 07:00 and takes you to the Yitzhak Rabin-Aqaba border crossing just outside of Eilat. Once you cross the border, a Jordanian tour guide drives you to Petra, where you spend about 4 hr before having a late lunch and returning to the border around 18:00. Day tours can sometimes be booked at your Eilat hotel after you arrive, but advance reservations are recommended, especially during peak travel times.\n\n## Sneak peek\nIn case you travel on a shoestring or really do not have the money for Petra, there is a way to see parts of Petra without having a ticket. From the highway south of Wadi Musa there leads a track to the top of the mountain that faces the Treasury. You can get some pretty good shots from there. Try OpenStreetMap, which many mobile Apps like OsmAnd or Mapy.cz, use to identify the track or look for an according GPX file for GPS navigation.\n\n## Wadi Musa to Petra\nMany hotels organise free transport to and from the entrance to Petra. Otherwise you can either walk downhill along Tourist Rd. for about 15 minutes, or take a taxi for 1-2 JD.\n\n## Within Petra\nThe only modes of transport allowed within Petra are on two feet or four (camel, donkey, or horse). There are 4 segments within Petra with 4 possible types of transport: from the entrance to the Siq (by foot or horse), from the Siq to the Treasury (by foot or cart), from the Treasury to the stairs of the Monastery (by foot, donkey or camel), the 800 stairs of the monastery (by foot or donkey).\nWhen entering Petra, there is a brief hike down towards the Siq. Horses will be available for travel to the entrance of the Siq. The prices for such rides are not set and are extremely negotiable, depending on one's bargaining abilities. Although the horse guides will tell you that riding a horse to the Siq entrance is included in the ticket price, they will try to sell you a longer tour, and argue aggressively for a 'tip'. As the walk down to the Siq entrance is only 15 min, it's not really worth it. The horses have been treated so badly in the past that a clinic to treat and heal them from the bad treatments they receive has been opened left to the entrance. It's not uncommon to see wounded animals, especially those pulling the carts, to be put to gallop under 37°C.\nDonkeys are exploited by small groups of Bedouin youths who use 75 cm electrical cable sections to strike them all the way up to the Monastery. So if you can walk, it's better to spare the animals.\nThe video in the Petra Museum (just past the security gate and the ticket sales booth) tells visitors not to ride the donkeys because:\nOnce you arrive at the Treasury and throughout Petra, there will be many camel and donkey owners jockeying for your business. Be prepared to do some bargaining and don't pay more than 15 JD per hour. Often there are times when the owner will drop his price in half simply by hearing a few phrases in Arabic.\nCamel transport could be an option. Riding a camel is a unique experience along the Main Trail.\nMuch of Petra is literally covered in feces from all of the animals, and it has a near-perpetual smell—especially in narrow areas like the Siq and the tombs that are full of animal (and human) feces. Please don't fund the exploitation of animals that's destroying this World Heritage Site and making it an unpleasant visit for others.\n\"Free with ticket\" scam: Even though it might state on your ticket that the horse/donkey transport from the entrance to the Siq is included in the price, it is a common way to scam people into paying unjustified amounts of money for the guides service. Some guides with horses and donkeys will offer you to carry you further, but many people ended up paying 50 JD for a two-hour ride, which is beyond fair and justified. Don't fall for any such lies and simply reject any offer. If you really want to use their service, agree on an all-inclusive price for animal, guide and any other services beforehand and only hand over the money at the finish. Do not get tricked into extra tracks, services or anything these scammers could charge you for.\nHowever, if you are reasonably fit and the weather is good, walking the whole of Petra is quite nice. Prefer climbing the Monastery's path before 15:00, otherwise it will be mostly in the shadow. If you are a good hiker, Petra area including the Monastery climb, the climb up the tombs to see the Treasury from above and even the High Place of Sacrifice are possible on one day.\nThere is an unofficial section from the High Place of Sacrifice directly down to the Treasury, saving you some time, but finding it can be a little tricky. Try OpenStreetMap, which at least shows the official track to its very end. The other way around from the bottom of the Treasury is blocked by a sign and probably official personnel. Not going down to the Treasury, you can even walk back to the highway.\n\"You need a guide\" scam: On some trails (especially an ascent from the Treasury and a walk starting between the entrance and the Siq), touts may falsely tell you that a guide is mandatory and may pursue you (on foot or horseback) to try to force you to turn back. Some routes are officially designated as \"dangerous without a guide\" (though this very much depends on your mobility and the weather), but a guide is not mandatory. On the other hand, some other routes are indeed blocked off, but in that case having a local guide doesn't detract from the fact that you are trespassing. In any case, if hassled, the best thing to do is to try to ignore them. In busy hours, tourist police are often nearby, especially near the Treasury.\n\n## See\nGuides can be hired from about 25 JD and up (depending on what you want to see) at the Visitors Center. Many of them were born and raised in Petra, and will gladly share their knowledge with you. Major hotels can rent you a portable Easyguide audio guide (10 JD/day) for commentary in English, Arabic, French and Spanish. Easyguide is also available as a mobile phone service on all Jordanian mobile phone networks; a map is needed to use this service.\n30.32300635.4564911 Siq. The entrance to Petra is a long, winding sandstone canyon (about 2 km). There are minor carvings spotted here and there throughout the Siq, but the most impressive sights are the colorful and unusual sandstone patterns in the rock walls. There are also remains of terracotta pipes built into the sides of the canyon that were used in Roman times to carry water.\n30.3220635.451452 Treasury (Al-Khazneh in Arabic). Upon exiting the Siq, visitors can view this jaw-dropping grandeur. Be sure to note the urn atop the Treasury structure, it has been rumored that the urn contained a Pharaoh's hidden treasure, and the urn bears the bullet pock marks where Bedouin travellers throughout the years have tested the theory. Get there when the park opens at 06:00 or 06:30 (depending on the season) and you may have the Treasury all to yourself or with fewer than 5-10 people around and no vendors.\n30.32297135.4503033 Street of Facades. Past the next bend is this part also sometimes called outer Siq, a large canyon lined with the facades of various tombs.\n30.32477335.4469624 Nabatean Theatre. At the end of the Street of Facades is the 7000-seat Roman Theater. The theater was created by the Nabateans but later enlarged by the Romans. It is still used for occasional performances.\n30.32658335.4490435 Royal Tombs. On the side of the valley opposite the Roman Theater and a short walk up the hill, are the tombs. The name was given because they are quite grand in scale compared to the others in the area, but it is unclear for whom the tombs were built.\n30.33063935.4443216 Byzantine Church.\n30.32871435.4422847 The Great Temple.\n30.33822835.4309278 Monastery (ad-Deir). The largest carved monument in Petra, dates back to the 1st century AD. The interior, like that of the Treasury, is underwhelming in comparison to the façade. The more than 800 steps up to the Monastery can take over an hour, and even if you take a donkey you will have to walk and climb for about 10 minutes near the end.      (updated Jun 2020)\n30.33973435.4259689 Desert View (beyond the Monastery). If you follow the track further from the Monastery, you will reach a camp offering tea and stuff to sell, which offers a great view of the desert to the west.\nPetra by Night. Happens on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday at 20:30 (be there at 20:15!). Entrance fee is 17 JD and you do not need a day pass. Order your tickets at your hotel, or buy them at the site's visitor center. The approach to the Treasury through the Site is lit only by candles. Musicians will play about 15 min of Bedouin music, and you'll be served some tea in paper cups while you sit on mats at the Treasury. It's best to see this before you see Petra by day, as it becomes far less impressive if you already walked up to the Treasury during daytime. It's not amazing, but it's something nice to do during nighttime. However, there are really mixed reviews of this. (updated Jun 2020)\nPrincess Alia Clinic, Brooke Hospital for Animals. Just inside the entrance to the park. As you can witness inside Petra, not all donkeys, horses and camels are treated right. A few are overworked, carrying overweight tourist or being excessively whipped. The Brooke charity educates owners about the treatment of equestrian working animals and treats the animals for free. The clinic is happy to tell you about conditions for working animals in Jordan. You can give a donation to the clinic.\n30.3235.478410 Wadi Musa. This is the city next to Petra, doesn't have any big touristic attraction except for a great panorama from uphill.\nPetra Museum (just past the security gate right next to the Petra ticket sales booths). A small museum with lots of great info and artifacts about Petra. free.\n\n## Do\nFor the terminally energetic, there are a number of popular hikes around Petra. Most hikes last about 1-3 hr round-trip.\nIn order to understand what Petra is, it is better to spend two days there. The first day: Siq - Treasury - City - Monastery. The second day: another way to Petra through Wadi Muthlim - see the Treasury from above on Jebel Al -Khubtha - High Place of Sacrifice. If you enter Petra through Wadi Muthlim do not turn left immediately after the small Siq, first go right to see Aqueduct, Tunnel and Al-Wu'eira Fort and only after that return to Petra center. It may not be possible to go through this route due to excess water in it. It's not recommended doing this route without a guide.\n30.329435.45031 Tomb Staircases. Just after the last tomb on the side of the Royal Tombs, there leads a staircase up the mountain which gives a good view of the Petra area. At the very end of this track there is a camp giving a great view from above the Treasury.\n30.32156135.4470482 High Place of Sacrifice. The site at the top of the mountain contains elaborate rock altars used for sacrifices. From the High Place, one can view much of Petra from above. Beautiful scenery. It can get cold and windy up there. The trek down the back side of the mountain reveals many interesting tombs and carvings that might be missed by the average tourist. The round trip generally takes 1.5-2.5 hr. Not many people go through the back route as it's not always clear where it starts - ask or use OpenStreetMap to identify the track. You might even try to use the direct track to the Treasury, which is even harder to find and not official, even though the staircases are clearly visible from down the Treasury.\n30.31709235.4066783 Mountain of Aaron (Jabal Haroun). This is the highest peak in the area. At the top you will find a small church and the tomb of Aaron, brother of Moses. The route to the top and back will take you past the Monastery and will take 4-8 hours depending on your chosen path.\n\n## Buy\nThroughout Petra, vendors will offer bottles of decorative sand art (small ones about 1 JD bigger ones up to 6 JD). While they may appear similar to other such souvenirs found in other Jordanian locations, these are unique in that the sand used to create the art is naturally colored sand scraped from the rock walls of various Petra canyons and not artificially colored. The most common design displays a camel's silhouette against a desert background. Some artists can write a name inside the sand bottle in a surprisingly short amount of time.\nBracelets, necklaces and rings are sold frequently by vendors walking around and presenting their goods. Offers vary extremely in price and often salespersons claim that they are made out of silver, even though they are not (1-5 JD is a fair price for most of the offered goods).\nThere is a fruit and vegetable market next to the minibus station in Wadi Musa.\nSouvenirs in Petra/Wadi Musa often cost twice or three times the price demanded in the rest of Jordan. So, if you are also going to visit the rest of Jordan, do your shopping there.\n\n## Ancient coin, mister?\nThe Bedouin tradesmen around the area will display artificial \"ancient\" Roman or Nabatean coins which are rather large in size. If pressed further, they will generally have a hidden stash of small, authentic coins from various periods. However buying these coins encourages the illegal looting of archaeological sites. To supply you with a souvenir the local inhabitants destroy graves, tombs and buildings in searches for coins and other antiquities. The Antiquities Law of 1988 states that individuals who engage in illicit excavations and/or trading in antiquities are criminals.\n\n## Petra\nThere is only one restaurant in all of the Petra site, at the far end of the Roman Highway. It's operated by Crowne Plaza, and it does a roaring trade despite steep pricing.  It also has the valley's monopoly on beer (6.5 JD for a 300 ml can, Oct 2018).\nFor just snacks and hot & cold drinks however, there are small stores and vendors scattered throughout Petra.  You can also bring your own food and drinks with you.  Some hotels will sell you a boxed lunch if you ask in advance.\nMany of these shops are powered by petrol. If you follow the electrical cables, they go up the slope into the old tombs where the generator is running. Not only does this create sound and air pollution, but the top of these old cave tombs becomes thick with soot and desecrating their beauty. Please don't buy from these vendors.\nShade is sparse in Petra, and on a hot summer day you can expect to go through at least 4 l of water (and more if you can afford to carry it). The need for water in the winter months is much less. You can buy water from shops in Petra, although the prices are high:  0.5-l bottles cost 1 JD, and 250 ml soft drinks cost 2 JD (Oct 2018).  On warm spring and summer days, if you can freeze a few bottles, then you'll be carrying around a cooling system, and have cold water to drink later in the day, too.\nThere are several bathrooms along the Main Trail with running water.\n\n## Wadi Musa\n30.32078535.4794031 Al-Janoub Sweets. Delicious sweets beyond the ordinary stuff sold by many shops around the country. Baklava filled with cheese or pudding, other sweety warm rolls and nuts and almonds specialities. 0.2 JD per small piece, 0.5 JD per piece on a plate.\nAl-Wadi Restaurant (on Shaheed roundabout/Circle in the center of town), ☏ +962 7 7725 9961. Reasonably priced, and the servers are extremely friendly. 2-4 JD for a main dish.\nCleopetra (below Circle/Al Wadhi restaurant). About 1 JD for a falafel or a tea.\nWrangler Bar (at Petra Palace Hotel). Cosy bar with alcoholic drinks and oldies but goodies music. 4 JD for beer and wine.\nValentine Inn (see below) sells various alcoholic beverages and is famous for that with the locals.\nSi Wan restaurant has some good local food with fair prices. Also, there's a good and cheap bakery near it.\nMountain Pub (at Hidab Hotel). Traditional wood bar with alcoholic beverages, hot and cold drinks, and snacks.\n\n## Sleep\nThe most authentic way to stay in Petra, and very budget and unique experience, is to stay in a cave with a local. When you walk around Petra you will be approached by many nice local people with camels or donkeys inviting you to have tea with them. When you talk to them for a bit, they will propose to stay in their cave with them, cook dinner for you and hang out with you in the evening. They can also help you get back to your hotel after dinner. It is a very basic accommodation, but they can give you blankets and mattresses. Of course they wouldn't do that if it were not for an appropriate donation, but something around the price of budget accommodations in town is reasonable. It is probably always best to stay in a group of friends, just in case. This way the \"payoff\" for the local is more worth the effort.\n\n## Budget\nMost accommodation will be available through the common hotel websites. To get a good price, check out a place's availability and location and just turn up and ask for the price referring to the website. But even walking around in the center of Wadi Musa will give you plenty of options. But in high season book ahead.\n30.3225735.4807281 Valentine Inn, Wadi Mousa, Jabal Alzohour Str, Jordan.

In a renovated 19th-century village, this is quite possibly the best hotel and almost certainly the most stylish one in Petra, if not in all of Jordan. The 111 rooms are all in individual houses decorated in Bedouin style. The inevitable handicraft shops are attractively camouflaged in a \"souq\", and there are good restaurants and even a Turkish bath on hand. The resort is a fair distance from Petra, but a courtesy shuttle bus is provided once a day: 09:30 to Petra and 14:30 for the return. This doesn't give enough time for exploration of Petra. If you have your own transportation, this is doable. If not, you end up paying 8 JD each way for a taxi. Rooms start at US$110.\n30.2886535.4565814 Mövenpick Nabatean Castle Hotel, Wadi Mousa 71810, P.O. box 184, ☏ +962 3 21 57 20 1, fax: +962 3 21 57 20 9, resort.petra.nabatean@moevenpick.com. Check-in: 14:00, check-out: 12:00. A 10-minute drive from the entrance to the historic site of Petra, in a secluded position on a hillside at an altitude of 1,400 metres. All the hotel's 90 rooms and suites are spacious and most have extraordinary views over the Great Rift Valley. Interconnecting rooms and non-smoking rooms are available on request. From 66 JD.\n\n## Stay healthy\nThe most cold and rainy months to visit Petra are December and January. In this time it is warm during the day and very cold in the evenings and at nights. That's why it is necessary to take coats, hats and gloves. And it could warm up your visit there if you take a thermos with hot tea with you. Avoid going if the forecast shows a lot of rain, as the guards may need to transport tourists out if the valley starts to flood.\nIn warmer months, the hot, dry air sometimes results in nosebleeds. If you're prone to that problem, then home remedies include smearing petroleum jelly to the insides of your nostrils.\nCarry plenty of water into Petra or bring 10–20 Jordanian dollars per person to buy water there.  In the hot summer months, you may want to add some oral rehydration products or to bring ice water.\nA good sunhat or baseball cap, sunglasses, and a generous hand with the sunscreen will help you avoid getting a heat stroke and sunburn.\n\n## Stay safe\nThe park is populated by a significant number of Bedouins, living in caves, tents, and buildings off the main tourist trail. A handful undertake herding and agriculture and your interactions with them (if any) are likely to be brief and pleasant; however, the vast majority are focused on tourism within the park. The perceived wealth of tourists, together with a high visitor turnover and ineffective authorities, can make the (unavoidable) interactions with these touts unsavory at best, and occasionally quite intimidating.\nSome practices have already be mentioned in the according chapters before. Here are some more:\nAnimal mistreatment – You will not visit Petra without witnessing the kind of animal abuse that would lead to imprisonment in western countries. The touts who work with horses, donkeys, and camels think nothing of beating them, including with sticks or rocks. This is especially prevalent towards closing time, and might entirely sour one's visit. Despite animal protection being mentioned on a sign near the entrance, the authorities have not yet fixed this issue.\nFake park rangers – In addition to the tourist police, some park rangers work in the park. The park rangers' primary tasks are to ensure the preservation and scenic quality of the site, and to assist tourists in education and appreciation of the park. Therefore, if a difficult gentleman claims to be a park ranger and insists on inspecting your ticket, consider showing him, but do not physically hand over your ticket.\nChanging money – One or two touts may ask you to exchange some foreign money (maybe a €10 note) to JD, complaining that there is no bank in Petra. It is not recommended.\nFemale travelers – The internet is awash with stories of female travelers who have experienced financial scams, uncomfortable situations, or worse. Western women are often assumed to be promiscuous and even a basic interaction might be construed as an advance. So accepting an invitation for a walk, an Arabic coffee, or an evening under the stars might be inadvisable. Likewise, in the adjoining town, if a woman sits in the front seat of a taxi (even in a group situation) this might be taken as an invitation.\nWhile going off the main tourist path is a rewarding experience for the trails, scenery, and less-visited archaeological sites—the further you stray, the less likely you are to come across police or fellow tourists who could help if necessary—best to always go in a group.\n\n## Cope\nWhile the main trail has proper bathrooms, you may not encounter one if you do some trekking. Be prepared with plenty of water and dig a cat hole. If you must use toilet paper (instead of a rock or water) or need to change a tampon or menstrual pad, be sure to dispose of it properly.  Many of the tombs in Petra are literally full of feces and (worse) feces-smeared toilet paper. Don't contribute to the desecration of these beautiful sites. If you have to go, bury your excrement off the trail (not in a tomb!) and dispose your toilet paper in a decent and proper manner.  Bring a small plastic bag with your toilet paper, so you can seal it up and carry it back to an appropriate trash can.\nIf you use a wheelchair or otherwise have mobility limitations, you will probably only be able to see part of Petra.  The valley floor is fairly smooth, but the higher parts of the city, including the Monastery, require climbing hundreds of steps.  A small number of electric golf carts (club cars) are available for short-term rental at the tourist center.  If you can get one, it will help travelers who with fatigue or who use a cane, but wheelchairs can't be carried on them.\n\n## Go next\n30.37434535.44979611 Little Petra — a scaled down version of Petra, is accessible by taxi or from Petra. It is less traveled than the main site and is well worth the visit if you spend more than a day in Wadi Musa. Approximate cost for a cab ride to and from the site, including having the taxi wait for an hour or so, is 25 JD (Oct 2018). There is also at least one minibus leaving from the bus station (city center) around 12:00. Price: Free.\nWadi Rum — a stunning desert valley in southern Jordan, lies about an hour south of Petra. Buses leave in the morning (~06:30) and generally cost 5 JD. Make arrangements through your hotel. Taxis for 40 JD (Oct 2018).\nDana Nature Reserve — stay in a local village within the Nature Reserve, and enjoy unforgettable hiking in an offshoot of the Great Rift.\n30.53144935.56083612 Shoubak Castle (Al-Shobak / Shawbak) (south of Kerek and Dana Reserve, from the highway (fuel station) it is a 20-min direct hike (not along the road)). It is on a hill with spectacular views and a great for a stop when going south to Petra. Most of the castle is a pile of rubble but there are underground rooms to explore, including the staircase (through a metal door that should be open) that goes down 375 steps to the old wells (tunnel and staircase temporarily closed for renovations. July 2023). Take a torch. At the bottom, you can climb up metal rungs to a hatch next to the road below the castle, then walk back up the road. Along a side road to the castle, you can also find 30.52925535.56505915 The smallest hotel in the world with a steep price of 25 JD, but maybe it can be bargained down to 15 JD, considering there is only space for one. Just nearby the owner of it also has regular rooms with dinner and breakfast. 1 JD.\nKerak — site of a once-mighty Crusader castle.\n31.46662435.57367713 Wadi Mujib — great nature reserve famous for its impressive canyons. Read more here. Limited access in winter.\nMadaba — known as the 'City of Mosaics' for its Byzantine and Umayyad mosaics, especially a large Byzantine-era mosaic map of Palestine and the Nile delta at St. George Church.\nDead Sea — The lowest point on earth and the most saline sea, letting you float on top.\nBuses to Aqaba also leave in the morning for 5 JD (price for tourists) (~07:00). From Aqaba, it is possible to cross the border to Eilat in Israel and from there to Taba in Egypt.\nTo get to Amman, you can take a minibus from the central bus station. There must be one every hour until 14:00 or 15:00. JETT also has a daily bus leaving at 17:00 from the parking close to the visitor center.\nFor a cheaper trip, a public minibus from Wadi Musa (Petra) to Ma'an is 0.55 JD and from there to Aqaba 1.5 JD. Also cheap buses to Amman from Aqaba pass by here.\nMost budget hotels have tours but the level of organization varies a lot and could prevent you from taking a tour. It is best to form a group yourself (at least 4 persons). An example tour could be Kings way trip: Shoubak Castle, Dana Nature Reserve, Tafilah, Karak Castle, Dead Sea, Mt. Nebo, Madaba & Churches, and Amman for about 30 JD at the Valentine Inn.",
