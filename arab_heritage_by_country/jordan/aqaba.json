      "content": "Aqaba (English:   AK-ə-bə, US also  AHK-; Arabic: الْعَقَبَة, romanized: al-ʿAqaba, pronounced [ælˈʕæqɑba, ælˈʕæɡæba]) is the only coastal city in Jordan and the largest and most populous city on the Gulf of Aqaba. Situated in southernmost Jordan, Aqaba is the administrative center of the Aqaba Governorate. The city had a population of 148,398 in 2015 and a land area of 375 square kilometres (144.8 sq mi). Aqaba has significant trade and tourism. The Port of Aqaba also serves other countries in the region.\nAqaba's strategic location at the northeastern tip of the Red Sea between the continents of Asia and Africa has made its port important for thousands of years. The ancient city was called Elath, known in Latin as Aela) and in Arabic as Ayla. Its strategic location and proximity to copper mines made it a regional hub for copper production and trade in the Chalcolithic period.\nAela became a bishopric under Byzantine rule and later became a Latin Catholic titular see after Islamic conquest around AD 650, when it became known as Ayla; the name Aqaba is late medieval. In the Great Arab Revolt's Battle of Aqaba Arab forces defeated the Ottoman defenders.\nAqaba's location next to Wadi Rum and Petra has made it one of the major tourist attractions in Jordan. The city is administered by the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, which has turned Aqaba into a low-tax, duty-free city, attracting several mega projects like Ayla Oasis, Saraya Aqaba, Marsa Zayed and expansion of the Port of Aqaba. They are expected to turn the city into a major tourism hub in the region. However, industrial and commercial activities remain important, due to the strategic location of the city as the country's only seaport. The city sits right across the border from Eilat, likewise Israel's only port on the Red Sea. After the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, there were plans and hopes of establishing a trans-border tourism and economic area, but few of those plans have come to fruition.\n\nName\nIn antiquity, the name of the city was Elath or Ailath. The name is presumably derived from the Semitic name of a tree in the genus Pistacia. Modern Eilat (established 1947), situated about 5 km north-west of Aqaba, also takes its name from the ancient settlement. In the Hellenistic period, it was renamed Berenice (Ancient Greek: Βερενίκη Bereníkē), but the original name survived, and under Roman rule was re-introduced in the forms Aila, Aela or Haila, adopted in Byzantine Greek as Αἴλα Aíla and in Arabic as Ayla (آيلا). The crusaders called the city Elyn.\nThe present name comes from the identically-named Gulf of Aqaba, named that as early as 150 A.D. (or somewhat later, if added by a subsequent editor), as evidenced by the plotting of a Mt. Acabe ('Ακάβη όρος) in Ptolemy's Geography, which mountain is shown directly across from the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, on the western coast of the Red Sea, probably somewhere in the vicinity of modern Hurghada, Egypt, and ancient Mons Claudianus, both of which placenames could also themselves be derived cognate forms of the word Aqaba, the former by morphological drift, the latter as a translation into Latin, wherein \"Claudianus\" also suggests limping or stumbling, a perfect semantic overlap for the literal Arabic meaning of \"Aqaba\" (عقبة), as an \"obstacle,\" \"stumbling block,\" or \"spine.\"  Thus the Gulf of Aqaba may've in turn gotten its name from this older region, West of it, around Mt. Acabe (not necessarily a single identifiable mountain), construed as the rough spine of highland that must be crossed, to pass thru the natural trade corridor there, from the Upper Nile to the Red Sea, along modern Egyptian Highway 60.  \nThis name first became mentioned in connection with the city itself of Aqaba, in the 12th century, as ʿaqabat Aylah (عقبة آيلة, 'the mountain-pass of Ayla'), mentioned by Idrisi, at a time when the settlement had been mostly reduced to a military stronghold, properly referring to the pass just to the north-east of the settlement (29.559°N 35.095°E﻿ / 29.559; 35.095, now traversed by the Jordanian Aqaba Highway).\n\nHistory\nNearby Chalcolithic sites\nExcavations at two tells (archaeological mounds) Tall Hujayrat Al-Ghuzlan and Tall Al-Magass, both a few kilometres north of modern-day Aqaba city, revealed inhabited settlements from c. 4000 BC during the Chalcolithic period, with thriving copper production on a large scale. This period is largely unknown due to the absence of written historical sources. University of Jordan \narchaeologists have discovered the sites, where they found a small building whose walls were inscribed with human and animal drawings, suggesting that the building was used as a religious site. The people who inhabited the site had developed an extensive water system in irrigating their crops which were mostly made up of grapes, olives and wheat. Several different-sized clay pots were also found suggesting that copper production was a major industry in the region, the pots being used in melting the copper and reshaping it. Scientific studies performed on-site revealed that it had undergone two earthquakes, with the latter one leaving the site completely destroyed.\n\nEarly history\nElath\nThe Edomites, who ruled over Edom just south of the Dead Sea, are believed to have built the first port in Aqaba called Elath around 1500 BC, turning it into a major hub for the trade of copper as the Phoenicians helped them develop their maritime economy. They profited from its strategic location at the junction of trading routes between Asia and Africa.\n\nTell el-Kheleifeh\nArchaeologists have investigated an Iron Age settlement at Tell el-Kheleifeh, immediately west of Aqaba, inhabited between the 8th and 4th centuries BCE.\n\nUndefined\nAround 735 BC, the city was conquered by the Assyrian empire. Because of the wars the Assyrians were fighting in the east, their trading routes were diverted to the city and the port witnessed relative prosperity. The Babylonians conquered it in 600 BC. During this time, Elath witnessed great economic growth, which is attributed to the business background of its rulers who realized how important the city's location was. The Persian Achaemenid Empire took the city in 539 BC.\n\nClassical antiquity\nHellenistic period\nThe city continued to grow and prosper which made it a major trading hub by the time of the Greek rule by 300 BC, after the Wars of Alexander the Great, it was described by a Greek historian to be \"one of the most important trading cities in the Arab World\". The Ptolemaic Greeks called it Berenice.\nThe Nabatean kingdom had its capital north of the city, at Petra.\n\nRoman period\nIn 64 BC, following the Roman conquest, they annexed the city and called it Aela (also Haila, Aelana, in Greek rendered Αἴλα Aila).\nBoth Petra and Aela were under strong Nabatean influence despite the Roman rule. Aela reached its peak during Roman times, the great long-distance road the Via Traiana Nova led south from Bostra through Amman, terminating in Aela, where it connected with a west road leading to the Paralia and Roman Egypt.\nAround AD 106 Aela was one of the main ports for the Romans.\n\nLate Roman and Byzantine periods\nThe Aqaba Church was constructed under Roman rule between 293 and 303 and is considered to be the oldest known purpose-built Christian church in the world. By the time of Eusebius, Aela became the garrison of the Legio X Fretensis, which was moved to Aela from Jerusalem.\n\nOne of the oldest known texts written in the Arabic alphabet is a late 4th-century inscription found in Jabal Ram 50 kilometres (31 miles) east of Aqaba.\nThe city became a Christian bishopric at an early stage. Its bishop Peter was present at the First Council of Nicaea, the first ecumenical council, in 325. Beryllus was at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and Paul at the synod called by Patriarch Peter of Jerusalem in 536 against Patriarch Anthimus I of Alexandria, a council attended by bishops of the Late Roman provinces of Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda and Palaestina Tertia, to the last-named of which Aela belonged.\nA citadel was also built in the area that became the focal point of the Roman southern defense system.\nIn the 6th century, Procopius of Caesarea mentioned a Jewish population in Eilat and its surroundings which enjoyed autonomy until the time of Justinian I (r. 527–565).\nAccording to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad himself reached Aila during the expedition of Tabuk of 630, and extracted tribute from the city.\nDuring the Late Byzantine or even Early Muslim period, Aila was the origin of what came to be known as the Ayla-Axum amphoras.\n\nEarly Muslim Ayla\nAila fell to the Islamic armies by 629, and the ancient settlement was left to decay, while a new Arab city was established outside its walls under Uthman ibn Affan, known as Ayla (Arabic: آيلا).\nThe Early Muslim city was excavated in 1986 by a team from the University of Chicago. Artefacts are now on exhibit at Aqaba Archaeological Museum and Jordan Archaeological Museum in Amman. The fortified city was inscribed in a rectangle of 170 × 145 meters, with walls 2.6 meters thick and 4.5 meters high, surrounding a fortified structure, occupying an area of 35 × 55 meters. 24 towers defended the city. The city had four gates on all four sides, defining two main lines intersecting at the centre. The intersection of these two thoroughfares was indicated by a tetrapylon (a four-way arch), which was later transformed into a luxury residential building decorated with frescoes dated to the tenth century. This type of urban structure, known as a misr (pl. amsar), is typical of early Islamic fortified settlements.\n\nThe city prospered from 661 to 750 under the Umayyads and beyond under the Abbasids (750–970) and the Fatimids (970–1116). Ayla took advantage of its key position as an important step on the road to India and Arab spices (frankincense, myrrh), between the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian Peninsula. The city is also mentioned in several stories of the Arabian Nights.\nThe geographer Shams Eddin Muqaddasi describes Ayla as nearby the ruined ancient city.\nThe city was mentioned in Medieval Arabic sources as having a mixed population of Jews and Christians. It subsequently became an important station for pilgrim caravans on the way to Mecca.\nThe city was \"completely destroyed\" by the 1068 Near East earthquake.\n\nCrusader/Ayyubid and Mamluk periods\nBaldwin I of Jerusalem took over the city in 1115 without encountering much resistance. The centre of the city then moved to 500 meters along the coast to the south, and the crusader fortress of Elyn was built, which allowed the Kingdom of Jerusalem to dominate all roads between Damascus, Egypt, and Arabia, protecting the Crusader states from the east and allowing for profitable raids on trade caravans passing through the area. In order to secure this strategic position, Baldwin also built and garrisoned a fortress on Pharaoh's Island (called Île de Graye by the Franks), the modern Jazīrat Fir'aun in Egyptian territorial waters about 7 kilometres (4 miles) west of Aqaba.\nThe garrison of Elyn (now serving primarily as a military outpost) was further strengthened in 1142 by Pagan the Butler, Lord of Oultrejourdain, who pursued an ambitious program of castle building throughout his domain. However, there was no large-scale settlement of Europeans in the area, and the region between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba remained mainly inhabited by Bedouins, who were obliged to pay tribute to the Lordship of Oultrejourdain. Despite all efforts to fortify the region, the city was captured in 1170 by a squadron sent by Saladin as he was besieging Gaza; while it was successfully raided by Raynald of Châtillon in 1182, it was never retaken by the Crusaders.\nThe old fort was rebuilt, as Aqaba Fortress, by Mamluk sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh Al-Ghuri in the early 16th century. For the next four centuries, the site was a simple fishing village of little importance.\n\nModern history\nDuring World War I, the Ottoman forces were forced to withdraw from Aqaba in 1917 after the Battle of Aqaba, led by T. E. Lawrence and the Arab forces of Auda Abu Tayi and Sherif Nasir. The capture of Aqaba allowed the British to supply the Arab forces. In 1918, the regions of Aqaba and Ma'an were officially incorporated into the Kingdom of the Hejaz. In 1925, Ibn Saud the ruler of Nejd with the help of his Wahhabi Ikhwan troops successfully annexed the Hejaz, but gave up the Ma'an and Aqaba to the British protectorate of Transjordan.\n\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 8,908 inhabitants in 'Aqaba.\nIn 1965, King Hussein, through an exchange deal with Saudi Arabia, gave 6,000 square kilometres (2,317 square miles) of desert land in Jordanian territories in exchange for other territories, including 12 kilometres (7 miles) of an extension of prime coastline south of Aqaba, which included the Yamanieh coral reef. Aqaba was a major site for imports of Iraqi goods in the 1980s until the Persian Gulf War.\nIn 1997, the Aqaba Marine Reserve was established within the southern boundaries of the Gulf of Aqaba.\n\nGeography\nThe city lies at Jordan's southernmost point, on the Gulf of Aqaba lying at the tip of the Red Sea. Its strategic location is shown in the fact that it is located at the crossroads of the continents of Asia and Africa, while bordering Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\nClimate\nAqaba has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with mild, sometimes warm winters and very hot dry summers. Subzero temperatures can be observed every few years. The record high temperature of 49.6 °C (121.3 °F) was registered on 14 August 2025 . The record low temperature of −3.9 °C (25.0 °F) was on January 16, 2008, as in Eilat.\n\nLocal government\nIn August 2000, the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA) was established which acted as the statutory institution empowered with administrative, fiscal, regulatory and economic responsibilities.\n\nAdministrative divisions\nJordan is divided into 12 administrative divisions, each called a Governorate. Aqaba Governorate divides into 3 Districts, some of which are divided into Subdistricts and further divided into villages.\n\nEconomy\nWith status as Jordan's special economic zone, Aqaba's economy is based on the tourism and port industry sectors.\nAqaba's location next to Wadi Rum and Petra has strengthened the city's location on the world map and made it one of the major tourist attractions in Jordan. The city is administered by the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, which has turned Aqaba into a low-tax, duty-free city, attracting several mega projects like Ayla Oasis, Saraya Aqaba, Marsa Zayed and expansion of the Port of Aqaba. They are expected to turn the city into a major tourism hub in the region. Industrial and commercial activities remain important, due to the strategic location of the city as the country's only seaport.\nAqaba is the only seaport of Jordan so virtually all of Jordan's exports depart from here. Heavy machinery industry is also flourishing in the city with regional assembly plants being located in Aqaba such as the Land Rover Aqaba Assembly Plant. \nBy 2008 the ASEZ had attracted $18bn in committed investments, beating its $6bn target by 2020 by a third and more in less than a decade. The goal was adjusted to bring in another $12bn by 2020, but in 2009 alone, deals worth $14bn were inked. Some projects currently under construction are:\n\nMarsa Zayed a $10 billion is the largest mega mixed-use development project ever envisioned in both Jordan and the region. Marsa Zayed will host facilities including residential neighborhoods, commercial outlets and amenities, entertainment venues, financial and business facilities, and a number of hotels. Additionally, the property will feature marinas and a cruise ship terminal. Marsa Zayed will encompass 6.4 million square meters of built-up property.\nSaraya Aqaba, a $1.5 billion resort with a man made lagoon, luxury hotels, villas, and townhouses that will be completed by 2017.\nAyla Oasis, a $1.5 billion resort around a man made lagoon with hotels, villas, an 18-hole golf course designed by Greg Norman.  It also has an Arabian Venice theme with apartment buildings built along canals only accessible by walkway or boat. This project will be completed by 2017.\nTala Bay, Tala Bay was developed in a distinctive architectural style that blends Jordanian and regional architecture with total cost of US$680 million.  Another distinguishing feature of this single community resort is its two-kilometer private sandy beach on the Red Sea.\nThe Red Sea Astrarium (TRSA), the world's only Star Trek themed park, worth $1.5 billion would have been completed by 2014 but cancelled in 2015.\nPort relocation. Aqaba's current port will be relocated to the southernmost part of the province near the Saudi border. Its capacity will surpass that of the current port.  The project costs $5 billion, and it will be completed by 2013.\nAqaba will be connected by the national rail system which will be completed by 2013.  The rail project will connect Aqaba with all Jordan's main cities and economic centers and several countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Syria.\nThe Aqaba Container Terminal (ACT) handled a record 587,530 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in 2008, an increase of 41.6% on the previous year. To accommodate the rise in trade on the back of the increasing popularity of container shipping and the stabilising political situation in Iraq, the Aqaba Development Corporation (ADC) has announced plans for a new port. The port relocation 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the south will cost an estimated $600m and will improve infrastructure, while freeing up space for development in the city. Plans for upgrading the King Hussein International Airport (KHIA) and the development of a logistics centre will also help position Aqaba as a regional hub for trade and transport.\n\nTourism\nAqaba has a number of luxury hotels, including in the Tala Bay resort 20 km further to the south, which service those who come for fun on the beaches as well as Scuba diving. Aqaba offers more than thirty primary diving locations, with the majority of them accommodating divers of all skill levels. These diving sites comprise fringing reefs that extend for over 25 kilometers, reaching all the way to the border with Saudi Arabia.\nIt also offers activities which take advantage of its desert location.  Its many coffee shops offer mansaf and knafeh, and baqlawa desserts. Another very popular venue is the Turkish Bath (Hamam) built in 306 AD, in which locals and visitors alike come to relax after a hot day.\n\nIn 2006, the Tourism Division of the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA) reported that the number of tourists visiting the Zone in 2006 rose to about 432,000, an increase of 5% over previous year. Approximately 65%, or 293,000 were Jordanians. Of foreign tourists, Europeans visited the Zone in the largest numbers, with about 98,000 visiting during the year. The division has financed tourism advertising and media campaigns with the assistance of the European Union.\nAqaba has been chosen for the site of a new waterfront building project that would rebuild Aqaba with new man-made water structures, new high-rise residential and office buildings, and more tourist services to place Aqaba on the investment map and challenge other centers of waterfront development throughout the region.\nAqaba was chosen as the Arab Tourism City of 2011.\nDuring the 5-day holiday at both the end of Ramadan and Eid Al-Adha, Jordanian and western expats flock into the city with numbers reaching up to 50,000 visitors. During this time the occupancy rate of most hotels there reaches as high as 90%, and are often fully booked.\nThe several development projects (i.e. Ayla, Saraya etc.) now taking place in Aqaba provide \"opportunities of empowerment\" for local populations that want to expand their agency within the city. According to Fulbright scholar Kimberly Cavanagh development projects will help exhibit the ways global- local partnerships and the resultant cultural exchanges,  can result in mutually beneficial outcomes.\n\nDemographics\nThe city of Aqaba has one of the highest population growth rates in Jordan in 2011, and only 44% of the buildings in the city had been built before 1990. A special census for Aqaba city was carried by the Jordanian department of statistics in 2007, the total population of Aqaba by the census of 2007 was 98,400.  The 2011 population estimate is 136,200. The results of the census compared to the national level are indicated as follows:\n\nReligion\nِIslam represents the majority of the population of Aqaba, but Christianity still exists today. Approximately 5,000 Christian families live in the city. There are several churches in the city and multiple Christian schools including Rosary Sisters School Aqaba.\n\nCityscape\nResidential buildings in Aqaba are made up of 4 stories, of which are covered with sandstone or limestone. The city has no high-rises; however, Marsa Zayed project is planned to dramatically change that reality through the construction of several high-rise towers that host hotels, residential units, offices and clinics.\n\nCulture\nMuseums\nThe largest museum in Aqaba is the Aqaba Archaeological Museum.\n\nLifestyle\nAqaba has recently experienced a great growth in its nightlife, especially during the dramatic increase of tourist number in the 2000s.\n\nTransport\nRail\nThe Aqaba railway which transported phosphate to the old port ceased operations in 2018. A successor line to transport phosphate from Al Shidiya and Ghor es-Safi to the new terminal in Port of Aqaba is planned through an agreement between Jordan's Ministry for Transport and Etihad Rail.\nThere has been propositions to connect Eilat to Aqaba by rail.\n\nAirports\nKing Hussein International Airport is the only civilian airport outside of Amman in the country, located to the north of Aqaba. It is a 20-minutes drive away from the city center. Regular flights are scheduled from Amman to Aqaba with an average flying time of 45 minutes which is serviced by Royal Jordanian Airlines and Jordan Aviation Airlines. Several international airlines connect the city to Istanbul, Dubai, Alexandria, Sharm el-Sheikh, and other destinations in Asia and Europe. Since the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, there were plans to jointly develop airport infrastructure in the region. However, when Israel built Ramon Airport only 10 km distant from King Hussein International Airport, this happened without consulting the Jordanian side, which caused a slight deterioration of bilateral relations between the two countries and concerns over the safety of having two airports so close together.\n\nRoads\nAqaba is connected by an 8,000 kilometres (5,000 mi) modern highway system to surrounding countries. The city is connected to the rest of Jordan by the Desert Highway and the King's Highway that provides access to the resorts and settlements on the Dead Sea. Aqaba is connected to Eilat in Israel by taxi and bus services passing through the Wadi Araba crossing. And to Haql in Saudi Arabia by the Durra Border Crossing. There are many bus services between Aqaba and Amman and the other major cities in Jordan, JETT and Trust International are the most common lines. These tourist buses are spacious and installed with air conditioning and bathrooms.\n\nPort\nThe Port of Aqaba is the only port in Jordan. Regular ferry routes to Taba are available on a daily basis and are operated by several companies such as Sindbad for Marine Transportation and Arab Bridge Maritime. The routes serve mainly the Egyptian coastal cities on the gulf like Taba and Sharm Al Sheikh. In 2006, the port was ranked as being the \"Best Container Terminal\" in the Middle East by Lloyd's List. The port was chosen for its recent improvements and its ability to handle local traffic as well as international traffic to four neighboring countries.\n\nWildlife\nThe Gulf of Aqaba is rich with marine life. The gulf is home to approximately 500 fish species, with many being permanent residents, like lion fish and octopus, while others are migratory, typically appearing during the summer, such as sailfish, considered the fastest fish in the ocean, as well as the world's largest fish, the whale shark. Marine mammals and reptiles also inhabit the gulf during summer, hawksbill sea turtles, and bottle nosed dolphins call Aqaba's gulf home as well. A large number of predatory shark species used to inhabit Aqaba's gulf but, due to overfishing and pollution, this population is in decline.  While mostly deep water sharks such as the tiger sharks and thresher sharks are present, there are also a small number of reef sharks as well. The world's fastest shark, the short-fin mako shark is the most commonly caught species by fishermen in Aqaba. Whale sharks, locally known as Battan,  are the most commonly sighted. Conservationists are working hard to protect Aqaba's shark population.\nThe gulf of Aqaba hosts more than 390 bird species including migratory birds such as the greater flamingo, great white pelican and the pink-backed pelican.\n\nEducation\nThere is a University of Jordan Aqaba Branch.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nAqaba is twinned with:\n\nGallery\nSee also\nAqaba Special Economic Zone Authority\nDisi Water Conveyance Project\nMidian\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nAqaba Marketing and Tourism Directorate\nPhotos of Aqaba at the American Center of Research\nPhotos of Aqaba / Ayla at the American Center of Research\nAqaba - the Jewel of the Red Sea",

      "content": "العقبة هي المدينة الساحلية الوحيدة في الأردن، والمدينة الأكبر والأكثر سكانا بين مدن خليج العقبة جميعها. تقع العقبة في أقصى جنوب المملكة الأردنيّة الهاشميّة على ساحل البحر الأحمر، وهي مركز محافظة العقبة. تبعد المدينة حوالي 330 كيلومتر جنوب العاصمة الأردنية عمّان. وقد بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2015 حوالي 148,398 نسمة، حيث تُعد خامس أكبر مدينة في المملكة. وتبلغ مساحة المدينة 375 كيلومتر مربع (144.8 ميل2). وللعقبة دور كبير في الاقتصاد الوطني الأردني وتطويره؛ وذلك من خلال كل من القطاعين التجاري والسياحي. ويُذكر أن ميناء العقبة يعد معبرا بحريا مهما للدول الأخرى المجاورة للأردن كذلك.\nبسبب موقعها الاستراتيجي في أعلى شمال شرقي خليج العقبة المتفرع من البحر الأحمر، والذي يتوسط الطرق التجارية بين قارتي آسيا وإفريقيا؛ كل ذلك جعل من العقبة ومنفذها البحري منطقة مهمة عبر آلاف السنين. بالإضافة لذلك، تتميز مدينة العقبة بأنها منطقة إستراتيجية والمنفذ البحري الوحيد للأردن، كما أنَّ للعقبة حدود برية مع مدينة حقل في المملكة العربية السعودية عبر مركز حدود الدرة، وحدود بحرية مع مصر وأيضا مع مدينة إيلات عبر معبر وادي عربة وكلتا المدينتين تقعا على رأس خليج العقبة المتفرع من البحر الأحمر. وتشتهر العقبة بكونها منطقة جاذبة لهواة الغوص بشواطئها المطلة على البحر الأحمر. وتضم المدينة العديد من المنشآت الصناعية الهامة، والمناطق التجارية الحرة، ومطار الملك حسين الدولي. وتعتبر مركزا إدارياً مهماً في منطقة أقصى جنوب الأردن. ومصدر للفوسفات وبعض أنواع الصدف. ويقدر عدد سكان المدينة بحوالي 150,000 نسمة.\nالاسم القديم للمدينة بحسب التوراة العبرية كان إيلات، وهو الاسم الذي استمر في الحقب اللاحقة الرومانية وفي عهود الخلافة الإسلامية على شكل أيلة، ثم آيلة. وبسبب موقعها موقعها الاستراتيجي وقربها من مناجم النحاس، فقد كانت مركزًا إقليميًا لإنتاج النحاس وتجارته خلال العصر النحاسي. خلال الاحتلال البزنطي للمنطقة، أصبحت العقبة -أيلة آنذاك - أبرشية نصرانية، لتتحول بعد ذلك خلال الحكم العربي الإسلامي لأبرشية فخرية، وذلك عندما صار اسم المدينة آيلة. أما اسم العقبة الحالي فهو ظهر في العهود المتأخرة من القرون الوسطى. وخلال الثورة العربية الكبرى، وقعت في العقبة معركة عرفت تاريخيا باسم معركة العقبة والتي كان لانتصار العرب فيها على الأتراك الأثر الحاسم في جلاء الأتراك عن البلاد العربية.\nموقع مدينة العقبة بالقرب من وادي رم ومدينة البتراء إحدى عجائب الدنيا السبع، جعل منها ومن المواقع المذكور ما يعرف بمثلث الأردن السياحي الذهبي؛ الشيء الذي قوّى من مكانتها السياحية على الخريطة العالمية، كما جعلها واحدة من كبريات الوجهات السياحية الجاذبة في الأردن. تُدار العقبة اقتصاديا وخدماتيا من خلال سلطة منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة، والتي ساهمت بتحويل مدينة العقبة إلى مدينة منخفضة الضرائب وخالية من الرسوم الجمركية، مما جعلها نقطة جاذبة لكبريات المشاريع مثل منتجعات آيلة وسرايا العقبة ومرسى زايد  و هناك ايضاً رفاهيات مثل مهرجان العقبة و فعاليات رياضية مثل سباقات القوارب وغيرها وايضاً  توسعة ميناء العقبة. كل تلك المشاريع من المتوقع منها أن تحول العقبة إلى نقطة جذب سياحية كبرى على مستوى الإقليم. ومع ذلك، تبقى للأنشطة التجارية والصناعية أهميتها الكبيرة؛ وذلك بسبب موقع العقبة وطبيعتها الاستراتيجية، كونها هي المنفذ البحري الوحيد للأردن على العالم.\n\nالتسمية\nقبل اسم العقبة كان يطلق عليها اسم آيلة وتعني في اللغة:\n\n \n  \nأما اسم العقبة فبرز في العصر المملوكي، حيث كانت المدينة تذكر بأيلة أو عقبة أيلة ردحاً طويلاً من الزمن، حتى غلب اسم العقبة عليها في العصر المملوكي.\n\nتاريخ\nمنذ 4000 سنة قبل الميلاد كانت العقبة موطنا للعديد من الشعوب بسبب موقعها الاستراتيجي على البحر وعلى تقاطع الطرق بين آسيا وأفريقيا وأوروبا. كانت أحد أهم مدن النبطيين الذين توسعوا في المنطقة واستوطنوها. وكانت معبراً لطرق التجارة الدولية، تمر منها وتعود من خلالها القوافل القادمة من الحجاز وجنوب الجزيرة العربية متجهين إلى مصر أو بلاد الشام.\nأطلق اليونانيون عليها اسم بيرنايس وأطلق عليها الرومان مسمى إيلا أو إلينا. خلال العهد الروماني كان طريق فيانوفاتريانا يتجه جنوباً من دمشق مارا بعمّان وينتهي في العقبة ومن هناك تتصل بالطريق المتجه غرباً إلى فلسطين ومصر.\nبعد عهد النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم أصبحت العقبة تحت الحكم الإسلامي ثم تنقلت ملكيتها بين العديد من السلالات الحاكمة مثل الأمويون والعباسيون والفاطميون والمماليك.\nخلال القرن الثاني عشر الميلادي قام الصليبيون باحتلال المنطقة وبنوا فيها قلعة لا تزال محفوظة إلى الآن. وبالإضافة إلى بناء القلعة قاموا بتحصين جزيرة تتبع الآن المياه الإقليمية المصرية وتبعد 7 كم عن العقبة وتسمى جزيرة فرعون.\nفي عام 1170م استعاد صلاح الدين الأيوبي مدينة العقبة وجزيرة فرعون. ثم استولى عليها المماليك في عام 1250م وبنوا فيها حصنا في القرن الرابع عشر في عهد آخر حكامهم وهو قانصوه الغوري.\nمع بداية القرن السادس عشر خضعت المنطقة لنفوذ العثمانيين وفي فترة حكمهم بدأت تفقد العقبة أهميتها فصارت قرية صغيرة تعيش على صيد الأسماك.وتكون العقبة أجمل مدن الأردن\nخلال الحرب العالمية الأولى أجبرت القوات العثمانية على مغادرة القرية على يد القوات العربية بقيادة الشريف الحسين بن علي سنة 1917 ضاما العقبة لمملكته في الحجاز الأمر الذي أدى إلى فتح الأبواب لخطوط الدعم القادمة من مصر إلى القوات البريطانية والعربية في الأردن وفلسطين.\nفي عام 1965م تم الاتفاق بين الأردن والسعودية على أن تأخذ السعودية 6000 كم من الأراضي الصحراوية الداخلية الأردنية مقابل 12 كم على الساحل في المنطقة القريبة من العقبة.\n\nالتركيبة السكانية\nقامت دائرة الإحصاء الأردنية في عام 2007، باجراء عملية تعداد لسكان في مدينة العقبة، بالمقارنة مع الأردن على الصعيد المحلي. وكانت النتائج على النحو الاتي:\n\nالسياحة في العقبة\nتعتبر السياحة في مدينة العقبة نشطة لأسباب متنوعة وانها منطقة ساحلية تقع على البحر الأحمر، كما ان فيها أماكن جميلة يمكن زيارتها، فان العقبة منطقة مليئة بالسياح الذين يأتون للتمتع بالبحر الرائع والجو الجميل فيها.\nوتشتمل العقبة على أهم المشاريع المهتمة في السياحة البيئية في الأردن وهي محطة العقبة لمراقبة الطيور والتي تستقطب عشرات الالف وربما الملايين من الطيور المهاجرة أثناء رحلتها بين أوروبا وأفريقيا خلال موسمي الهجرة في الخريف والربيع، ويتضمن مشروع محطة العقبة لمراقبة الطيور غابه للاشجار الكبيرة وحدائق لأشجار واطنة في المنطقة بالإضافة لمسطحات مائية كبيرة تلعب جميعها بشكل متكامل على استقطاب أنواع مختلفة من الطيور قد يكون بعضها نادر الوجود على مستوى العالم الأمر الذي يدفع العديد من المهتمين بمراقبة الطيور وعلماء الطيور لزيارة المنطقة وعمل التحاليل العلمية والأبحاث الخاصة بعلم الطيور.\nوتعد العقبة بشكل خاص ومنطقة الأردن بشكل عام من المناطق المهمة عالميا لهجرة الطيور بناء على تصنيف Birdlife International.\n\nوتحتضن محطة العلوم البحرية الواقعة على الشاطئ الجنوبي لخليج العقبة معرضا للأحياء البحرية يستطيع الزائر أن يشاهد فيه الأنواع المختلفة من المرجان والأسماك وغيرها من الكائنات الحية المستوطنة في خليج العقبة. قامت هيئة تنشيط السياحة بعمل إعلانات وحملات دعائية، بمساعدة من الاتحاد الأوروبي.\nخلال فترة الأعياد الوطنية يأتي الأردنيون من شمال المملكة، ولا سيما من عمان واربد، إلى المنتجعات والشواطئ الرملية، لقضاء عطلة نهاية الأسبوع وخلال هذه الفترة تصل نسبة الإشغال في الفنادق إلى 100%. في 2011 اختيرت العقبة عاصمة للسياحة العربية.\nكما يوجد في مُحافظة العَقَبة وادي رم ذو الطّبيعة الرمليّة والجبليّة السّاحرة. وفي جنوب العَقَبة أعلى ارتفاع في الأردن على الإطلاق مُتمثّلأ بجبل أم الداميّ.\nتم افتتاح عام 2019 أول متحف عسكري مائي للغواصين في الأردن \nسيتم في عام 2020 الانتهاء من مشروع تطوير وتأهيل سارية العلم الموجودة في ساحة الثورة العربية الكبرى وستعتبر وجهة سياحية تتضمن خمس متاحف وأهم ما يميزها احتوائها على بيت الشريف حسين\n\nالاقتصاد\nاهتمت الأردن بالعقبة منذ التسعينات، لأنها الميناء الأردني الوحيد. سعى الأردن لتطوير العقبة بأكثر من صيغة، انتهت إلى إعطاء منطقة العقبة وضعا خاصا، مثل الحوافز، والإعفاء من الضرائب، والرسوم، والاستقلال الإداري عن عمان، كما تم وضع الخطط لاجتذاب الإستثمار الأجنبي. اقتصاد العقبة نما بسرعة كبيرة جدا بسبب إنشاء منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة. وهناك تطور في العمران (الإسكان) وتشييد منتجعات جيدة، ومشاريع جديدة مثل خليج تالا بي وسرايا العقبة التي ستكون مكان لإمضاء العطل والإجازات في منازل سكنية متطورة للسياح والمواطنين على حد سواء. وتم استثمار أكثر من عشرين مليار دولار في العقبة منذ العام 2001 عندما تم تأسيس المنطقة الاقتصادية الخاصة. وجذبت العقبة أيضا شركات لوجستية عالمية مثل ايه بي إم تيرمينالز واجيليتي للاستثمار في مجال الخدمات اللوجستية، مما عزز من وضع المدينة كمركز للنقل والخدمات اللوجستية.\nتوجد العديد من الفنادق في العقبة ولكن هناك أيضا فنادق جديدة قيد الإنشاء. العقبة هي الميناء البحري الوحيد للأردن لذلك تقريبا أغلب صادرات الأردن تغادر من هذه المدينة. أكثر من 20 مليار دولار من الاستثمارات تتدفق إلى العقبة من منطقة الخليج ومستثمريين أوروبيين، مما يجعل العقبة تتفوق على إيلات سياحيا واستثماريا، إيلات تلك المدينة المزدهرة التي تقع على بعد بضع كيلومترات فقط.\nبحلول عام 2008 كانت منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة جذبت 18 مليار دولار من الاستثمارات، وبهذا تكون المدينة ضربت الرقم 6 مليارات دولار الذي طمحت أن تصل إليه بحلول عام 2020، بمقدار 300% وأكثر من ذلك في أقل من عقد من الزمان. وقامت المدينة بتعديل هدفها الذي أصبح جلب 12 مليار دولار أخرى بحلول عام 2020، لكن في عام 2009 وحده وقّعت المدينة على صفقات بقيمة 14 مليار دولار. بعض المشاريع قيد الإنشاء حاليا وهي على النحو الآتي:\n\nسرايا العقبة: 1.5 مليار دولار لبناء منتجع يضم بحيرة صناعية، فنادق فخمة، فلل، ومنازل فخمة على أن يكتمل المشروع بحلول عام 2017.\nمنتجع واحة آيلا بقيمة 2.1 مليار دولار وبحيرة صناعية المنتجع مع فنادق فخمة، فلل، ت وملعب للجولف ذي 18 حفرة. ويحمل المنتجع طابعٌ يمثلُ بندقيةً عربية، بطريقة تصميم المباني التي بنيت على طول قنوات مائية لا يمكن الوصول إليها الا عن طريق قوارب أو مسارات خاصة. إلى جانب حديقة مائية جزء من مشروع واحة آيلا' الذي سوف يكتمل بحلول عام 2017.\nخليج تالا بي عبارة عن مجتمع منتقى ومتكامل، يقوم على مساحة مسيجة تبلغ 2.7 مليون متراً مربعا، يقع على الطرف الشمالي لخليج العقبة. وهذا المشروع اكتمل بقيمته 680 مليون دولار. كما يضم خليج تالا بي منتجعات وفنادق 4 أو 5 مثل فندق الهيلتون.\nمرسى زايد، أكبر مشروع عقاري وسياحي على مستوى المنطقة، يمتد على مساحة 3.2 كم مربع ويشمل واجهة مائية بطول 2 كم. ويهدف مشروع مرسى زايد إلى تطوير الواجهة البحرية وتحويلها إلى بيئة مؤهلة للاستخدام المتعدد الأغراض تنتشر عليها الأبراج السكنية المرتفعة والمناطق المخصصة للمرافق الترفيهية والسياحية وأخرى مخصصة للأعمال التجارية والفنادق العالمية، على أكثر من ثلاثة ملايين متر مربع من الأراضي. ومن جهة أخرى، ستعد مراسي اليخوت المتعددة التي سيتم إنشاؤها إضافة هامة للطاقة الاستيعابية للمراسي القائمة حالياً في مدينة العقبة، مما يسهم في تحويل مدينة العقبة إلى وجهة رئيسية لليخوت، بالإضافة لإنشاء ميناء حديث للبواخر السياحية معد وفق أفضل ما توصلت إليه التقنيات الحديثة في هذا المجال ليمثل بوابة للترحيب بزوار العقبة. سيتم تنفيذ هذا المشروع على عدة مراحل على مدار 30 عاما، ومن المقرر ان يكتمل المشروع بحلول عام 2017.\nنقل الميناء سوف سيتم نقل ميناء العقبة إلى الجزء الجنوبي من المحافظة بالقرب من الحدود السعودية، بحلول عام 2016 حسب ما هو مقرر. وتطوير الميناء ليكون مرفأ متطورا يضاهي المرافئ العالمية.\nسيتم ربط العقبة بمشروع شبكة السكك الوطنية، الذي سيتم الانتهاء منه بحلول عام 2013. وسوف يربط مشروع السكك الحديدية في العقبة مع جميع المدن الرئيسية في الأردن والمراكز الاقتصادية والعديد من الدول مثل المملكة العربية السعودية والعراق وسوريا.\n\nمنطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة\nاطلقت منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة (ASEZ) في عام 2001 بوصفها معفاة من الرسوم الجمركية، منطقة تنموية متعددة القطاعات بضرائب مخفضة تضم كامل منطقة الساحل الأردني (27 كم)، الموانئ البحرية الأردنية، ومطار دولي ومدينة العقبة التاريخية. تنظم منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة من قبل سلطة منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة وهي مكلفة بإدارة وتنظيم، وتقديم الخدمات البلدية داخل منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة. تعمل منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة بمبادرة تنموية مدفوعة من القطاع الخاص حيث تعمل على تعظيم مشاركة القطاع الخاص في السوق الحرة والاستفادة من المزايا الضريبية والبيئة التنظيمية المرنة. بالإضافة إلى جعلها وجهة سياحية فريدة على البحر الأحمر، مع واحة تسوق معفاة من الرسوم الجمركية يرافقه نوعية حياة عالية ومستوى معيشة.\n\nالمواصلات\nالنقل البري\nالعقبة متصلة بالعاصمة عمان، المناطق المجاورة والدول الحدودية بشبكة حديثة من الطرق السريعة، القادمين من عمان يمكن ان يسلكو طريق البحر الميت أو سلوك الطريق الصحراوي الذي يعبر صحراء الديسي وصحراء وادي رم حيث قام لورانس العرب بعبورها مع قافلته. اما النقل من وإلى ايلات عن طريق معبر وادي عربة، ومع المملكة العربية السعودية من مدينة حقل عبر مركز حدود الدرة.\nهناك العديد من الشركات التي تقدم خدمة المواصلات بين العقبة وعمان وغيرها من المدن الأخرى بواسطة حافلات حديثة. وتعتبر شركة جت وسيلة النقل الأكثر شيوعا، ويوجد أيضا شركة الثقة، وشركة المتميز. ويمكنك أيضا الوصول إلى العقبة عبر الحافلات العمومية. سكة حديد العقبة لاتنقل حاليا الركاب والمسافرين، بل هي مقتصرة في الوقت الحاضر على نقل البضائع.\n\nالنقل البحري\nتقدم شركة الجسر العربي للملاحة رحلات إلى العقبة من وإلى الموانئ المصرية قادمة من طابا ونويبع، حيث سافر أكثر من مليون مسافر بين العقبة ومرافئ نويبع وشرم الشيخ. اتحاد شركات من شركات أبو ظبي يسمى 'شركة المعبر' فاز بمناقصة لنقل وإدارة ميناء العقبة لمدة 30 عاما، ليستوعب 1.3 مليون راكب والآلاف من الشاحنات والسيارات القادمة من مختلف أنحاء الشواطئ في المصرية.\n\nالنقل الجوي\nيوفر مطار الملك حسين الدولي الواقع شمال المدينة، رحلات منتظمة من عمان إلى العقبة في رحلة تستغرق حوالي 45 دقيقة. ورحلات منتظمة إلى العقبة من عمان ودبي والإسكندرية (مصر)، بالإضافة إلى أوروبا.\n\nالتعليم\nالجامعة الأردنية فرع العقبة\nجامعة العقبة للتكنولوجيا\nكلية العقبة الجامعية / جامعة البلقاء التطبيقية\nيوجد ايضاً بالمحافظة العديد من المدارس الخاصة والحكومية يوجد حوالي 27 مدرسة خاصة من اشهرها مدارس دار اللطف الروم الكاثوليك ومدارس الاتحاد والراهبات الوردية ومدرسة العقبة الدولية ويوجد 19 مدرسة حكومية من اشهرها مدرسة الملك عبد الله الثاني للتميز ومدرسة الثامنة الثانوية للبنين، وبشكلا عام تتضمن العقبة 122 مدرسة وروضة خاصة أو حكومية.\n\nشاطئ الغندور\nشاطئ الغندور هو أقرب مكان عام يمكن السباحة فيه في خليج العقبة، وهو بالقرب من سارية علم الثورة العربية ويجتمع فيه بعض القوارب الزجاجية ويوجد به بعض المقاهي، يقصده الكثير من سكان الأردن وخاصة سكان العقبة.\n\nصور شاطئ الغندور\nمشهد بانورامي\nسارية العقبة التي تحمل العلم الذي

      "summary": "العقبة هي المدينة الساحلية الوحيدة في الأردن، والمدينة الأكبر والأكثر سكانا بين مدن خليج العقبة جميعها. تقع العقبة في أقصى جنوب المملكة الأردنيّة الهاشميّة على ساحل البحر الأحمر، وهي مركز محافظة العقبة. تبعد المدينة حوالي 330 كيلومتر جنوب العاصمة الأردنية عمّان. وقد بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2015 حوالي 148,398 نسمة، حيث تُعد خامس أكبر مدينة في المملكة. وتبلغ مساحة المدينة 375 كيلومتر مربع (144.8 ميل2). وللعقبة دور كبير في الاقتصاد الوطني الأردني وتطويره؛ وذلك من خلال كل من القطاعين التجاري والسياحي. ويُذكر أن ميناء العقبة يعد معبرا بحريا مهما للدول الأخرى المجاورة للأردن كذلك.\nبسبب موقعها الاستراتيجي في أعلى شمال شرقي خليج العقبة المتفرع من البحر الأحمر، والذي يتوسط الطرق التجارية بين قارتي آسيا وإفريقيا؛ كل ذلك جعل من العقبة ومنفذها البحري منطقة مهمة عبر آلاف السنين. بالإضافة لذلك، تتميز مدينة العقبة بأنها منطقة إستراتيجية والمنفذ البحري الوحيد للأردن، كما أنَّ للعقبة حدود برية مع مدينة حقل في المملكة العربية السعودية عبر مركز حدود الدرة، وحدود بحرية مع مصر وأيضا مع مدينة إيلات عبر معبر وادي عربة وكلتا المدينتين تقعا على رأس خليج العقبة المتفرع من البحر الأحمر. وتشتهر العقبة بكونها منطقة جاذبة لهواة الغوص بشواطئها المطلة على البحر الأحمر. وتضم المدينة العديد من المنشآت الصناعية الهامة، والمناطق التجارية الحرة، ومطار الملك حسين الدولي. وتعتبر مركزا إدارياً مهماً في منطقة أقصى جنوب الأردن. ومصدر للفوسفات وبعض أنواع الصدف. ويقدر عدد سكان المدينة بحوالي 150,000 نسمة.\nالاسم القديم للمدينة بحسب التوراة العبرية كان إيلات، وهو الاسم الذي استمر في الحقب اللاحقة الرومانية وفي عهود الخلافة الإسلامية على شكل أيلة، ثم آيلة. وبسبب موقعها موقعها الاستراتيجي وقربها من مناجم النحاس، فقد كانت مركزًا إقليميًا لإنتاج النحاس وتجارته خلال العصر النحاسي. خلال الاحتلال البزنطي للمنطقة، أصبحت العقبة -أيلة آنذاك - أبرشية نصرانية، لتتحول بعد ذلك خلال الحكم العربي الإسلامي لأبرشية فخرية، وذلك عندما صار اسم المدينة آيلة. أما اسم العقبة الحالي فهو ظهر في العهود المتأخرة من القرون الوسطى. وخلال الثورة العربية الكبرى، وقعت في العقبة معركة عرفت تاريخيا باسم معركة العقبة والتي كان لانتصار العرب فيها على الأتراك الأثر الحاسم في جلاء الأتراك عن البلاد العربية.\nموقع مدينة العقبة بالقرب من وادي رم ومدينة البتراء إحدى عجائب الدنيا السبع، جعل منها ومن المواقع المذكور ما يعرف بمثلث الأردن السياحي الذهبي؛ الشيء الذي قوّى من مكانتها السياحية على الخريطة العالمية، كما جعلها واحدة من كبريات الوجهات السياحية الجاذبة في الأردن. تُدار العقبة اقتصاديا وخدماتيا من خلال سلطة منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة، والتي ساهمت بتحويل مدينة العقبة إلى مدينة منخفضة الضرائب وخالية من الرسوم الجمركية، مما جعلها نقطة جاذبة لكبريات المشاريع مثل منتجعات آيلة وسرايا العقبة ومرسى زايد  و هناك ايضاً رفاهيات مثل مهرجان العقبة و فعاليات رياضية مثل سباقات القوارب وغيرها وايضاً  توسعة ميناء العقبة. كل تلك المشاريع من المتوقع منها أن تحول العقبة إلى نقطة جذب سياحية كبرى على مستوى الإقليم. ومع ذلك، تبقى للأنشطة التجارية والصناعية أهميتها الكبيرة؛ وذلك بسبب موقع العقبة وطبيعتها الاستراتيجية، كونها هي المنفذ البحري الوحيد للأردن على العالم.",

      "content": "Aqaba ou Akaba (en arabe : العقبة al-ʻAqabah) est une ville côtière de 88 780 habitants à l'extrémité sud de la Jordanie.\nAqaba occupe une position stratégique pour la Jordanie car c'est le seul port du pays. La ville est mitoyenne d'Eilat, en Israël, et un poste-frontière permet de s'y rendre. Aqaba et Eilat sont à la pointe nord du golfe d'Aqaba.\n\nHistoire\nAqaba est le site d'un peuplement habité depuis 4000 av. J.-C., notamment en raison de sa position stratégique au carrefour des routes commerciales entre l'Asie, l'Afrique et l'Europe. Le peuplement originel est connu sous le nom de Eilat (אֵילַת ou, dans la bible, Eilot : אֵלוֹת) en hébreu (et sans doute[réf. nécessaire] en édomite). C'était un centre édomite puis arabe nabatéen.\nLa Bible mentionne le lieu : « Le Roi Salomon construisit également des bateaux à Ezion-Geber, près de Eilat en pays édomite, au bord de la mer Rouge ». Ce verset fait probablement référence à un port de l'âge du fer construit sur la position actuelle d'Aqaba/Eilat.\nSous la dynastie des Ptolémées, les Grecs appellent la ville Bérénice, puis les Romains Aila et Aelena. Sous les Romains,  la Via Nova Traiana qui allait de Damas à Amman se prolongeait jusqu'à Aqaba, où elle rejoignait la route qui allait de l'Égypte à la Palestine.\nPeu après la mort de Mahomet, Aqaba fait partie du califat, et passe successivement entre les mains des Omeyyades, Abbassides, Fatimides et Mamelouks. Le début de l'ère musulmane voit la construction de la ville de Ayla, décrite par le géographe Shams Eddin Muqaddasi comme étant juste à côté de l'implantation originelle, alors en ruines. Ces ruines, révélées dans les années 1980 par une équipe archéologique américano-jordanienne, sont situées à faible distance du front de mer.\nAu XIIe siècle, les Croisés occupent la ville et construisent la forteresse de Helim, qui reste relativement bien préservée aujourd'hui. En plus de bâtir un fort dans Aqaba, les Croisés fortifient la petite île nommée Île de Graye (maintenant connue sous le nom d’Île du Pharaon, à 7 kilomètres de la côte). L'île se trouve désormais en territoire égyptien. Dès 1170, Aqaba et l'Île de Graye sont reconquises par Saladin. Les Mamelouks prennent la ville en 1250 et reconstruisent le fort au XVIe siècle au cours du règne d'un des derniers sultans Mamelouks, Qansah al-Ghouri.\nAu début du XVIe siècle, la dynastie mamelouk et la région passent sous influence ottomane. Sous les Ottomans, l'importance de la ville décline : Aqaba devient un simple village de pêcheurs.\nDurant la Première Guerre mondiale, les forces ottomanes sont forcées de se retirer de la ville en 1917 après un raid mené par Lawrence d'Arabie et les forces arabes de Hussein ben Ali. La région est alors annexée par le royaume du Hedjaz. La prise d'Aqaba permet l'approvisionnement à partir de l'Égypte, des forces arabes et britanniques combattant plus au nord, en Transjordanie et en Palestine. Aqaba est incorporée au protectorat britannique de Transjordanie en 1925.\n\nEn 1965, le roi Hussein de Jordanie élargit le territoire autour d'Aqaba. En échange de 6 000 km2 en Jordanie centrale, l'Arabie saoudite donne 12 kilomètres de côte au sud d'Aqaba. En plus de permettre l'extension du port, cet échange donne également accès à la Jordanie au magnifique corail de Yamanieh.\nJusqu'à la Guerre du Golfe, Aqaba était un des importateurs majeurs de biens irakiens.\nLe 20 août 2005, une attaque à la roquette vise deux bateaux de l'U.S. Navy (l'USS Ashland et l'USS Kearsarge) à quai. L'attaque les manque mais endommage des bâtiments voisins. L'attaque visait aussi la ville israélienne voisine d'Eilat.\n\nÉconomie\nDe nos jours, la ville est une station balnéaire et un centre de plongée. Cependant, il reste de nombreuses activités industrielles dans la zone, comme des raffineries de pétrole et de sucre. Elle exporte notamment du phosphate et des coquillages. Aqaba est également un centre administratif important au sud de la Jordanie.\nAqaba possède un aéroport (code IATA : AQJ). En 2010, des travaux pour réaménager la ville commence et le projet, du nom de Marsa Zayed, doit apporter à terme la construction de hautes tours, des hôtels, des magasins, résidentiels et récréatifs.\nEn 2011 était prise la décision de créer un parc à thème portant sur Star Trek - le premier au monde - sur la région d'Aqaba. Prévu pour ouvrir ses portes en 2014, ce parc devait coûter 1,5 milliard de dollars - chiffre impressionnant mais inférieur au coût d'un parc type Universal ou Disney. Ce projet tenait à cœur au roi qui est un \"Trekkie\" confirmé puisqu'il a fait une apparition dans un épisode de la série Star Trek : Voyager en 1995 mais celui-ci a été annulé début 2015.\nEn septembre 2017 est lancé le projet Sahara Forest Project, près d'Aqaba, qui vise à transformer des terres désertiques en terres cultivables. Le projet souhaite aboutir à une production de 130 tonnes de légumes biologiques par an, 10.000 litres d'eau potable à partir d'eau de mer, et va utiliser des panneaux photovoltaïques pour la production d'énergie solaire. Une station de désalinisation et un bassin pour la production de sel seront construits. Le projet, d'un coût de 750 millions d'euros, est soutenu par la Norvège et l'Union européenne.\n\nJumelages\nHammamet (Tunisie) depuis 1981\n Varna (Bulgarie)\n\nGalerie\nNotes et références\nAnnexes\nArticles connexes\nGhassanides (220-638), phylarcat arabe suzerain de l'Empire byzantin\nAncienne église d'Aqaba, Église de l'Orient, nestorianisme\nAnciennes cités établies sur le site  :\nEzion-Geber (époque biblique)\nAilana (époque romano-byzantine)\nAyla (époque musulmane)\nEilat (Israël)\nHampe de drapeau d'Aqaba\nMusée archéologique d'Aqaba\nUsine de dessalement de Jordanie\n\nLiens externes\n\nSite officiel\n\n(en) Histoire d'Aqaba\nMaxime Goepp, Benjamin Saintamon, « Aila (Jordanie) :: Princée d'Outre Jourdain », sur « Forteresses d'Orient »\n Portail de la Jordanie",

      "content": "## Overview\nAqaba (العقبة al-ʿAqabah) is Jordan's only port city. It is on the Gulf of Aqaba in the extreme south of the country, adjacent to Eilat in Israel.\n\n## Understand\nAqaba is Jordan's window on the Red Sea. Historically the same city as Eilat on the Israeli side of the border, plans for a shared international airport and other forms of cooperation have cooled down in the past few years during a period of political tension.  Aqaba has seen a lot of development.  This has improved the infrastructure and facilities.  Be prepared for road maps to be incorrect or out of date.\n\n## Get in\nWhen entering Jordan in Aqaba you may be entitled to a free visa. Further details you can find in the Jordan article.\n\n## By bus\nLocal minibuses connect residential areas with downtown. The fare is 17 piasters (0.17 JD) regardless of the length of the journey. Passengers can get on and off at any point of the route.\nThe central bus station is in front of the police station in King Talal street, less than 10 min walk from city centre (Ayla Square, Al-Hussein Bin Ali Mosque).\n\n## By car\nAmman to Aqaba is about 350 km using the Desert Highway. It will take about 4 hr to travel this distance at a reasonable speed. Service/fuel stops are not very frequent on this road.\nThere is a customs checkpoint at the border of the Aqaba Special Economic Zone. Officers will probably check the trunk of your car, but the checks are usually quick for private cars and taxis.\n\n## By taxi\nTaxis are easily available in the city. A ride within town should cost no more than 2 JD. A ride outside town (to a beach near by or to any border crossings) costs around 5 JD. However, if your hotel calls you a taxi, you may end up paying double for it as they receive a kickback (this is especially true if you are staying on the South Beach).\nWhile taxis are yellow all around Jordan, Aqaba taxis have been painted green and blue: the logo colours of Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZ).\nWhen negotiating the price of a taxi, make sure to determine whether the final cost is the total or \"per-person\" price, as you may otherwise receive a surprise at the end of the ride.\nApp-based taxies, such as the regional Careem or Uber, are not available within the city. You will have to use the local taxis.\n\n## By plane\n29.61161935.0180672 King Hussein International Airport (AQJ  IATA) (9 km (5.6 mi) north of Aqaba, about 20 min to drive).\nServed by a few airlines. Royal Jordanian operates between Amman and Aqaba. Duration of the flight is approximately one hour and costs around 50 JD + tax one-way. If there are two or more of you, it may be cheaper to take a taxi, especially once you factor in getting to and from the airport at each end.\nNote there is no public transport to and from the airport. To get a taxi that is cheaper than at the airport you can walk to the Jordan Valley Highway. That's how the locals do it. At the police checkpoint of the airport you may have to show your passport and answer where you are walking to.\nAlso you could hitchhike from the Jordan Valley Highway to Aqaba. Depending on the driver it may be for free or cost 1-2 JD. Agree on the price before you enter the car.\nMost larger hotels and dive operators can arrange airport transfers and hire-cars. Taxis in the airport are available for a fixed price. There is a big sign that shows you the prices.\nAn Israeli company offers a so-called \"Aqaba airport shuttle\" service through its website, which appears to be a scam, according to numerous online reviews on a number of different websites.\nGiven the relatively painless (for the area at least) border crossing process and the closeness of Eilat, it is also feasible to fly into Ramon Airport ETM IATA, which is served by the likes of Ryanair. The former Ovda and Eilat city airports have both closed. To cross the border, you need to pay the Israeli departure tax.\n\n## From other countries\nIf you are coming from Eilat, Israel, you will cross through the Yitzhak Rabin Terminal. It is open Sunday-Thursday from 06:30–20:00 and Friday-Saturday from 08:00–20:00, except for Yom Kippur and the Muslim New Year. Taxi from Eilat centre to the border is ₪35 (Feb 2014). The fee to exit Israel is ₪102 plus a processing fee of ₪5 – you can pay with credit card.\nIf you are planning to come to Aqaba directly from northern Israel (e.g. from Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, or Be'er Sheva) by catching an Egged bus to Eilat, or from Eilat by hopping on any intercity bus going up north, or on any of the buses going to Ramon airport, you should ask the driver to let you off at \"Rabin Border Crossing / Road 90 junction\", which is the second last stop before the bus station in Eilat, and then walk east to the border checkpoint (less than 1 km on auto route 109).\nAfter crossing the border, take a taxi from the taxi cartel (see below) for 11 JD, or just walk out. If the bird observatory to the right is open, walk straight through until the road with the fence and continue through the treatment plant further on another deserted road until you reach the housing area. From here, taxis are very cheap. If the bird observatory is closed, go through the sandy desert area to the right after it around the treatment plant until the road north of the new golf course, resort and oasis. It is best to have a map or GPS. If you get bothered by the taxi mafia, just keep walking, don't talk. The other way around is easier: either you walk through the treatment plant or cross through the sandy desert area straight north just before the treatment plant. If you get a taxi from the city for 5 JD, it is fine. 13 JD is way too much. In any case, if you feel you have been bothered, complain to the Ministry of Tourism & Antiquities[dead link].\nFerries run regularly from Aqaba across to Nuweiba on Egypt's Sinai peninsula, bypassing Israel and the sometimes complicated border arrangements. Generally, there is no visa fee for entering Jordan through Aqaba since it is a part of the free trade zone. The line to Nuweiba is operated by ABMaritime; see their website for the timetable and current prices.\nAlso ferries from Taba and Sharm el-Sheikh are available. There is more information about the boat crossing in the itinerary Ferries in The Red Sea.\n\n## On foot\nMost points of interest can be reached on foot, and that is really the best way to see the place and experience Aqaba.\n\n## See\nAs of December 2018, the staff at the information center near the castle claims that there is no place to use Jordan Pass in Aqaba, even though two museums are listed on the official website of Jordan Pass.\n29.52146535.0020471 Aqaba Castle (قلعة العقبة) (at the southern end of the city beach, behind the flagpole and museum). under reconstruction as of December 2018. It dates to the 14th century, although the present structure was built by the Mamluke sultan Qansawh el-Ghawri (1501-1516) and has been revised many times since then. The archaeological museum which used to be here no longer exists. 3 JD or free with Jordan Pass.      (updated Jul 2022)\n29.51668935.0015392 Aqaba Heritage Museum (at the southern end of the city). A simple museum on local history and people.\n29.53117335.0002653 Ayla (next to the Mövenpick resort). The old city that was established when Islam came to the area in 622 AD. 1 JD.\n29.533734.9994 Aqaba Church (Behind the JETT bus station, which is just west of the Mövenpick Resort & Residences). The oldest purpose-built Christian church in history. A posted sign (viewed in the right angle) gives a little bit of information on the church and its age.      (updated May 2021)\n29.52150335.0007955 Aqaba Flagpole (at the southern end of the city beach). The sixth tallest freestanding flagpole sits at a height of 130 metres high. It carries the flag of the Arab Revolt.\n29.51844535.0123196 Sheik Zayed Mosque. This mosque in the east beyond the highway gives a great overview of the area and Aqaba.\n29.458134.9767667 Marine Science Center Aquarium (5 km south of Aqaba). Small aquarium with a few local and exotic fish. Very small aquarium with limited information, not worth the high price for foreigners, but Jordanians (1 JD) might want to take their kids. 7 JD.\n\n## Do\nExcept the sea and diving, Aqaba doesn't have a lot of things to offer. The following can be of interest but are easily done in one day.\nAqaba Castle\nAqaba museum\nFourth century Roman church\nThere is a public beach between the city and the fort, although it can be very dirty.  There are several public beaches south of Aqaba, which also can be dirty.  Beaches generally have eating and showering facilities and sometimes watersports.\n29.5299935.033911 Mount Um al Nusaylah (try hiking up near Domina Aquamarina III Hotel, 1 km east of the bus station). Hike this mountain for a great view of the Aqaba area, Eilat on the other side of the Red Sea and the valley behind the mount.\n\n## Scuba diving\nHave a look at an online map south of Aqaba, such as in the Tala Bay article; many dive centers can be found there, and diving is extremely popular. A two-dive single-day package typically costs around 50 JD, but booking multi-dive packages in advance can save a lot. Almost all dives are shore based. A small number of sites are better accessed by boat, though the journey is never more than 45 min and is typically in the 20-min range. Though dive packages tend to be more expensive than nearby Egypt, the quality of operators is much more consistent, and the fact virtually all dives are done as shore dives save both money and time with day-boats. Diving here is also good for beginners, as there are no tides, and currents and swells this far up the gulf of Aqaba are minimal, which also means diving any given site is all but guaranteed, regardless of what the weather is up to.\n29.53241935.0010562 Ahlan Aqaba Scuba Diving Center, Al Nahda St., Hotel area in the heart of the city (The road behind the Mövenpick Hotel), ☏ +962 3 2062242, fax: +962 3 206 2243, info@diveinaqaba.com. 24/7.

Snorkeling, try dives, fun dives for certified divers, shore and boat dives and beginners courses through to Dive masters. Digital Underwater Photography (which only 4% of instructors can teach!)\n\n## Buy\nAll ATMs charge a relatively high fee for withdrawing money. In Jordan you can withdraw money from your credit card in various currency exchange places. A reliable and low-priced currency exchange service is Alawneh Exchange in the city center. They charge a low percentage fee for withdrawing money from your credit card. Many locals use that agency. You need to show your passport.\nAqaba is a tax-free zone so prices for expensive consumer items tend to be lower than elsewhere in Jordan. Hence, the high number of shops specialized in nuts and sweets, catering for Jordanian tourists.\nBeware however should you depart by plane from Aqaba: the Aqaba airport security check mafia will confiscate many types of goods on departure. See the note on the Aqaba airport security check mafia below.\n\n## Eat\nIn the centre of the city you can find very good hummus, falafel and shawarma (lamb meat in pita bread) places in many local restaurants. Prices start from 0.20 JD for stuffed pies (fatayer), 0.50 JD for a falafel sandwich, 1 JD for ful, baba ganous or hummus and pita, 1.50 JD for pizza-like snacks and 1.50 JD for a shawarma dish. Walk around to find the hole-in-the-wall eateries.\nFor local seafood, head to the Al-Afran street (locally known as the \"fishmarket\" or \"Souq As-Samak\"), which is located near the citadel and the beach area. The street is lined up with dozens of local fish shops (\"masmakeh\" in Arabic) that sell all kinds of seafood, and the majoity of customers are locals. In most shops, you can select your preference from the fresh catch of the day and specify how you want it to be cooked (e.g. grilled or deep-fried). You can also select standard meals from a fixed menu, such as sayadieh. Prices will vary according to the selected fish, but usually range from 5 to 10 JD per person. As of 2022, there's a new fishmarket building under construction  just south of the citadel, to which some of the shops may relocate in the future.\nMore fancy seafood restaurants are located around downtown (especially to the North). Some of those are local branches of eateries that also exist in other Jordanian cities, especailly Amman.\n\n## Budget\n29.52877935.00371 Dweik Hotel 1 (between Zahran St. and Raghadan St.).

From 88 JD.\n\n## Drink\nYou can ask for fresh fruit juices in most restaurants, and they are a treat! Many also serve lemon juice with fresh mint in it, which is very delicious.\nNot many restaurants outside of the resorts serve alcohol (Ali Baba does and they charge a lot for it) but there are many wine shops, e.g. along An-Nahdah Street, selling alcohol much cheaper than elsewhere in Jordan.\nA good, cheap variety of different teas (0.5 dinars) such as Karak tea and ginger tea can be had in long park area immediately east of the Ayla Circle. It's a nice, lively place to relax beneath the trees that is very popular with locals. They also sell very cheap shisha for 2 dinars each (updated January 2023)\n\n## Aqaba border taxi cartel\nTaxis at the border from Eilat belong to one company, which has a monopoly, and is therefore much more expensive than a typical Jordanian taxi: 11 JD (Feb 2014) for a 15-minute ride to the Aqaba bus station. This is no matter how many people go in the car, be insistent if you are told that sharing a taxi is not allowed. Also as of October 2014, there is a sign listing fixed prices to various destinations (8 JD to the airport, 11 JD to Aqaba, 55 JD to Petra, etc.) Once you get in to Aqaba, however, taxis to Petra are 35 JD, and the Wadi Musa taxi drivers will offer the same price back. Going the other way from Aqaba city centre to the border can be done for 8-10 JD (6-8 JD if you're lucky, Feb 2014).\nThe taxi company, just outside the customs gate, might stop other drivers and have them turn back to Aqaba. To try to avoid this, call your hotel or private car while still in the customs area.\nYou can try walking the 500 m to the main road (east), but the military personnel may have you brought back. Or you take a turn right directly after the border and follow the small sideroads to Aqaba—check OpenStreetMap or Google Maps for the situation.\nYou can ride right past if you have a bicycle, but you'll have to cross the border by foot. Even though bicycles are vehicles in the eyes of the road laws, they will force you to dismount and pass the border as if you were a pedestrian.\nIt is possible to bargain them down, but you will need to be persistent and enlist the help of the border police to mediate. Don't try to set the price too low. 5 JD to the airport is about as low as they'll go - 10 JD to Aqaba is most likely. Stay polite, but be firm and explain to the border police that it is not a good first impression for tourists to have and that you will write to the Ministry of Tourism. This threat normally sees the taxi cartel back down, but there are no guarantees.\nRiding back to the border from city center can be a problem. Should they have to wait, they'll try to switch on the taximeter and ask for 25-30 JD instead of the arranged 10 JD. Don't get intimidated, insist on the agreed pricing and perhaps offer 2 JD on top of the 10 to quiet things.\n\n## Aqaba Airport security check\nBeware of the security check scams, which have been reported as of late 2019: excuses will be made to confiscate locally-purchased luxuries for resale on the black market. Among items that seem to be systematically seized are purchases of Dead Sea beauty products, honey, molasses, and alcohol. Nothing including any sort of liquid can be considered safe, even in signed-in bags.\nAstute negotiation will help save some items, but beware of fake helpers: the scam clearly does not implicate everyone in the airport but your allies will probably not be those who will insistently offer to \"help\" you.\nIn any case keep calm and avoid escalating the situation. Innocently destroying the commercial value of confiscated goods might be an option, and perhaps open the packaging of any products to show that they could not possibly be dangerous. This could probably also be done in advance of your flight (defacing the labels for instance). Please do your bit and also report any incident to the Jordan Tourism Board. It is so sad to see the good vibes of this pleasant destination squandered by a few corrupt elements only minutes before leaving the country!\n\n## Go next\nIt can difficult to get mini-bus on Friday which is prayers' day, and on Friday and Saturday when there is no school. Try to check it with tourist information, bus station, police and your hotel.\nMany destinations that are not north of Amman can be reached on a day trip. You can set up your own flexible day trips by hiring a taxi for the day. However, some require more than one day, especially Petra and Wadi Rum. Make sure when you set up the trip that you have agreed on the destinations to be included in the trip (or you may need to discuss your price while on the road and do not have other options that your current driver). Alternatively, there are a lot of tour companies around town who would happily arrange excursions, in particular to Wadi Rum.\nWadi Rum — barren, isolated and beautiful, granite cliffs contrasting with desert sand, 50 km north of Aqaba. A trip here is only really complete with an overnight stay at one of the numerous camps.\nPetra — Jordan's top attraction, 2.5 hr north of Aqaba. An ancient city carved out of sandstone and one of the new 7 Wonders of the World. Can be done in a day if you are good on foot, but most people spend two days.\nDana Nature Reserve — Stay in a local village  within the Nature Reserve, and enjoy unforgettable hiking in an offshoot of the Great Rift.\nKerak — site of a once-mighty Crusader castle.\nMadaba — known as the 'City of Mosaics' for its Byzantine and Umayyad mosaics, especially a large Byzantine-era mosaic map of Palestine and the Nile delta at St. George Church.\nDead Sea — The lowest point on earth and the most saline sea, letting you float on top.\n\n## To Israel (Eilat)\nThe Israeli border at Arava (for Eilat) is only a short hop away. As of June 2022, the 10 JD exit tax is only charged to those who have stayed in the country for two nights or less (evidenced by the entry date on the visa stamp), even with the free ASEZA visa. Those that have stayed longer are not charged any tax. Note: if one does not have ASEZA visa, you have to pay the full visa fee as well if you stayed less than 4 days—see Jordan#Visa.\nAfter security, the counters are consolidated into 1-3 desks depending on the number of people passing through that day. If the exit tax/visa fee is applicable, one must pay it in cash to the border officer receive the exit stamp. Without this stamp you will not be allowed through the final check, and into no-man's land.\nGetting to the border is not as expensive or thrilling as getting from the border (see #Stay safe). Any green taxi in the city will be willing to take you there. The price they offer first is 7 JD or 10 JD, you can haggle it down to 5 JD if you haggling skills are good. Or you just walk from the edge of the city.\nThe border itself is rather quiet, which is surprising for an Israeli border. Just follow the signs. The crossing can take anywhere from half an hour to two hours depending on the size of the queue and how thoroughly the authorities are conducting screening that day.\n\n## To Saudi Arabia\nThe Saudi Arabian checkpoint is visible on a clear day, but visitors without a visa can only look.\n\n## To Egypt (Nuweiba)\nFerries to Egypt are operated by AB Maritime. The schedule changes rapidly with cancellations common, so it's recommended to check it when you arrive in Aqaba. As of November 20, 2011\nThe fast ferry is not operating\nThere is a slow ferry departing Aqaba at 13:00\nThere is a slow ferry departing Aqaba at 01:00\nThis will change based on seasonal loadings. The approximate cost for foreigners is US$65 + 5 JD departure fee. Pay the departure fee on the ground floor of the terminal building, then take the coupon upstairs for immigration purposes. After copious amounts of stamping, you can go and wait outside.\nIt is also recommended that you ring the AB Maritime ferry office to confirm the departure time for that day. Delays of several hours are common and sometimes known in advance.\nAlso ferries to Taba and Sharm el-Sheikh are available from Aqaba.",
