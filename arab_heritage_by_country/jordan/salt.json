      "content": "Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl). When used in food, especially in granulated form, it is more formally called table salt. In the form of a natural crystalline mineral, salt is also known as rock salt or halite. Salt is essential for life in general (being the source of the essential dietary minerals sodium and chlorine), and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings, and is known to uniformly improve the taste perception of food. Salting, brining, and pickling are ancient and important methods of food preservation.\nSome of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6000 BC, when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt works in China dates to approximately the same period. Salt was prized by the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Hittites, Egyptians, and Indians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues, for instance triggering the El Paso Salt War which took place in El Paso in the late 1860s. Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance.\nSalt is processed from salt mines, and by the evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. The greatest single use for salt (sodium chloride) is as a feedstock for the production of chemicals. It is used to produce caustic soda and chlorine, and in the manufacture of products such as polyvinyl chloride, plastics, and paper pulp. Of the annual global production of around three hundred million tonnes, only a small percentage is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt. Table salt usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.\nSodium is an essential element for human health via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic solute. However, excessive salt consumption increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. Such health effects of salt have long been studied. Numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods. The World Health Organization recommends that adults consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium, equivalent to 5 grams of salt, per day.\n\nHistory\nAll through history, the availability of salt has been pivotal to civilization. What is now thought to have been the first city in Europe is Solnitsata, in Bulgaria, which was a salt mine, providing the area now known as the Balkans with salt since 5400 BC. Salt was the best-known food preservative, especially for meat, for many thousands of years. A very ancient salt-works operation has been discovered at the Poiana Slatinei archaeological site next to a salt spring in Lunca, Neamț County, Romania. Evidence indicates that Neolithic people of the Precucuteni Culture were boiling the salt-laden spring water through the process of briquetage to extract salt as far back as 6050 BC. The salt extracted from this operation may have directly correlated with the rapid growth of this society's population soon after production began. The harvest of salt from the surface of Xiechi Lake near Yuncheng in Shanxi, China, dates back to at least 6000 BC, making it one of the oldest verifiable saltworks.\nThere is more salt in animal tissues, such as meat, blood, and milk, than in plant tissues. Nomads who subsist on their flocks and herds do not eat salt with their food, but agriculturalists, feeding mainly on cereals and vegetable matter, need to supplement their diet with salt. With the spread of civilization, salt became one of the world's main trading commodities. It was of high value to the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites and other peoples of antiquity. In the Middle East, salt was used to seal an agreement ceremonially, and the ancient Hebrews made a \"covenant of salt\" with God and sprinkled salt on their offerings to show their trust in him. \nAn ancient practice in time of war was salting the earth: scattering salt around in a defeated city to symbolically prevent plant growth. The Bible tells the story of King Abimelech who was ordered by God to do this at Shechem. Texts claim that the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus Africanus ploughed over and sowed the city of Carthage with salt after it was defeated in the Third Punic War (146 BC), although this story is now considered to be entirely apocryphal.\nSalt may have been used for barter in connection with the obsidian trade in Anatolia in the Neolithic Era. Salt was included among funeral offerings found in ancient Egyptian tombs from the third millennium BC, as were salted birds, and salt fish. From about 2800 BC, the Egyptians began exporting salt fish to the Phoenicians in return for Lebanon cedar, glass, and the dye Tyrian purple. The Phoenicians traded Egyptian salted fish and salt from North Africa throughout their Mediterranean trade empire. Herodotus described salt trading routes across Libya back in the 5th century BC. In the early years of the Roman Empire, roads were built for the transportation of salt from the salt imported at Ostia to the capital.\nIn Africa, salt was used as currency south of the Sahara. Slabs of rock salt were used as coins in Abyssinia. The Tuareg have traditionally maintained routes across the Sahara especially for the transportation of salt by Azalai salt caravans. The caravans still cross the desert from southern Niger to Bilma, although much of the trade now takes place by truck. Each camel takes two bales of fodder and two of trade goods northwards and returns laden with salt pillars and dates. In Gabon, before the arrival of Europeans, the coast people carried on a remunerative trade with those of the interior by the medium of sea salt. This was gradually displaced by the salt that Europeans brought in sacks, so that the coast natives lost their previous profits; as of the late 1950s, sea salt was still the currency best appreciated in the interior.\nSalzburg, Hallstatt, and Hallein lie within 17 km (11 mi) of each other on the river Salzach in central Austria in an area with extensive salt deposits. Salzach means \"salt river\", while Salzburg means \"salt castle\", both taking their names from the German word Salz, salt. Hallstatt was the site of the world's first salt mine. The town gave its name to the Hallstatt culture that began mining for salt in the area in about 800 BC. Around 400 BC, the townsfolk, who had previously used pickaxes and shovels, began open pan salt making. During the first millennium BC, Celtic communities grew rich trading salt and salted meat to Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome in exchange for wine and other luxuries.\nThe word salary comes from the Latin word for salt. The reason for this is unknown; a persistent modern claim that the Roman Legions were sometimes paid in salt is baseless. The word salad literally means \"salted\", and comes from the ancient Roman practice of salting leaf vegetables.\nWars have been fought over salt. Venice won the Salt War (1304) with Padua over supplying the product in certain areas, and the War of Ferrara (1482–1484) for the same reason. It played a role in the American Revolution and the San Elizario Salt War. Cities on overland trade routes grew rich by levying duties, and towns like Liverpool flourished on the export of salt extracted from the salt mines of Cheshire. Governments have at different times imposed salt taxes on their peoples. The voyages of Christopher Columbus are said to have been financed from salt production in southern Spain. The oppressive salt tax in France was one of the causes of the French Revolution. After being repealed, this tax was reimposed by Napoleon when he became emperor to pay for his foreign wars, and was not abolished until 1946. In 1930, Mahatma Gandhi led a crowd of 100,000 protestors on the \"Dandi March\" or \"Salt Satyagraha\", during which they made their own salt from the sea as a demonstration of their opposition to the colonial salt tax. This act of civil disobedience inspired numerous Indians and transformed the Indian independence movement into a national struggle.\n\nPhysical properties\nSalt is mostly sodium chloride (NaCl). Sea salt and mined salt may contain trace elements. Mined salt is often refined. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. When dissolved in water sodium chloride separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12 °C (−6.02 °F) for 23.31 wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7 °C (227.7 °F).\n\nEdible salt\nSalt is essential to the health of humans and other animals, and it is one of the five basic taste sensations. It is known to uniformly improve the taste perception of food, including otherwise unpalatable food. Salt is used in many cuisines, and it is often found in salt shakers on diners' eating tables for their personal use on food. Salt is also an ingredient in many manufactured foodstuffs. Table salt is a refined salt containing about 97 to 99 percent sodium chloride. Usually, anticaking agents such as sodium aluminosilicate or magnesium carbonate are added to make it free-flowing. Iodized salt, containing potassium iodide, is widely available. Some people put a desiccant, such as a few grains of uncooked rice or a saltine cracker, in their salt shakers to absorb extra moisture and help break up salt clumps that may otherwise form.\n\nFortified table salt\nSome table salt sold for consumption contains additives that address a variety of health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of additives vary from country to country. Iodine is an important micronutrient for humans, and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine (hypothyroidism) and enlargement of the thyroid gland (endemic goitre) in adults or cretinism in children. Iodized salt has been used to correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide, sodium iodide, or sodium iodate. A small amount of dextrose may be added to stabilize the iodine. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities. Iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used.\nThe amount of iodine and the specific iodine compound added to salt varies. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends 150 micrograms of iodine per day for both men and women. US iodized salt contains 46–77 ppm (parts per million), whereas in the UK the recommended iodine content of iodized salt is 10–22 ppm.\nSodium ferrocyanide, yellow prussiate of soda, is sometimes added to salt as an anticaking agent. Such anticaking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely. The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive was found to be provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988. Other anticaking agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or magnesium carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two compounds.\nIn \"doubly fortified salt\", both iodide and iron salts are added. The latter alleviates iron deficiency anaemia, which interferes with the mental development of an estimated 40% of infants in the developing world. A typical iron source is ferrous fumarate. Another additive, especially important for pregnant women, is folic acid (vitamin B9), which gives the table salt a yellow colour. Folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects and anaemia, which affect young mothers, especially in developing countries.\nA lack of fluoride in the diet is the cause of a greatly increased incidence of dental caries. Fluoride salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries where water fluoridation is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.\n\nOther kinds\nUnrefined sea salt contains small amounts of magnesium and calcium halides and sulfates, traces of algal products, salt-resistant bacteria and sediment particles. The calcium and magnesium salts confer a faintly bitter overtone, and they make unrefined sea salt hygroscopic, i.e., it gradually absorbs moisture from air if stored uncovered. Algal products contribute a mildly \"fishy\" or \"sea-air\" odour, the latter from organobromine compounds. Sediments, the proportion of which varies with the source, give the salt a dull grey appearance.\nSince taste and aroma compounds are often detectable by humans in minute concentrations, sea salt may have a more complex flavour than pure sodium chloride when sprinkled on top of food. When salt is added during cooking however, these flavours would likely be overwhelmed by those of the food ingredients. The refined salt industry cites scientific studies saying that raw sea and rock salts do not contain enough iodine salts to prevent iodine deficiency diseases.\nSalts have diverse mineralities depending on their source, giving each  a unique flavour. Fleur de sel, a natural sea salt from the surface of evaporating brine in salt pans, has a distinctive flavour varying with its source. In traditional Korean cuisine, so-called \"bamboo salt\" is prepared by roasting salt in a bamboo container plugged with mud at both ends. This product absorbs minerals from the bamboo and the mud, and has been claimed to increase the anticlastogenic and antimutagenic properties of doenjang, a fermented bean paste. Kosher or kitchen salt has a larger grain size than table salt and is used in cooking. It can be useful for brining, in bread or pretzel making, and as a scrubbing agent when combined with oil.\n\nSalt in food\nSalt is present in most foods, but in naturally occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it is present in very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where it functions as both a preservative and a flavouring. Dairy salt is used in the preparation of butter and cheese products. As a flavouring, salt enhances the taste of other foods by suppressing the bitterness of those foods making them more palatable and relatively sweeter.\nBefore the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting was one of the main methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67 mg sodium per 100 g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990 mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63 mg while bacon contains 1,480 mg, and potatoes contain 7 mg but potato crisps 800 mg per 100 g. Salt is used extensively in cooking as a flavouring, and in cooking techniques such as with salt crusts and brining. The main sources of salt in the Western diet, apart from direct use, are bread and cereals, meat, and dairy products.\nIn many East Asian cultures, salt is not traditionally used as a condiment. In its place, condiments such as soy sauce, fish sauce and oyster sauce tend to have a high sodium content and fill a similar role to table salt in western cultures. They are most often used for cooking rather than as table condiments.\n\nBiology of salt taste\nHuman salt taste is detected by sodium taste receptors present in taste bud cells on the tongue. Human sensory taste testing studies have shown that proteolyzed forms of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) function as the human salt taste receptor.\n\nSodium consumption and health\nTable salt is made up of just under 40% sodium by weight, so a 6 g serving (1 teaspoon) contains about 2,400 mg of sodium. Sodium serves a vital purpose in the human body: via its role as an electrolyte, it helps nerves and muscles to function correctly, and it is one factor involved in the osmotic regulation of water content in body organs (fluid balance). Most of the sodium in the Western diet comes from salt. The habitual salt intake in many Western countries is about 10 g per day, and it is higher than that in many countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. The high level of sodium in many processed foods has a major impact on the total amount consumed. In the United States, 75% of the sodium eaten comes from processed and restaurant foods, 11% from cooking and table use and the rest from what is found naturally in foodstuffs.\nBecause consuming too much sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake is associated with a greater risk of stroke, total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000 mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.\nThe World Health Organization recommends that adults should consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium (which is contained in 5 g of salt) per day. Guidelines by the United States recommend that people with hypertension, African Americans, and middle-aged and older adults should limit consumption to no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day and meet the potassium recommendation of 4,700 mg/day with a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables.\nWhile reduction of sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day is recommended by developed countries, one review recommended that sodium intake be reduced to at least 1,200 mg (contained in 3 g of salt) per day, as a further reduction in salt intake led to a greater fall in systolic blood pressure for all age groups and ethnicities. Another review indicated that there is inconsistent/insufficient evidence to conclude that reducing sodium intake to lower than 2,300 mg per day is either beneficial or harmful.\nEvidence shows a more complicated relationship between salt and cardiovascular disease. \"The association between sodium consumption and cardiovascular disease or mortality is U-shaped, with increased risk at both high and low sodium intake.\" The findings showed that increased mortality from excessive salt intake was primarily associated with individuals with hypertension. The levels of increased mortality among those with restricted salt intake appeared to be similar regardless of blood pressure. This evidence shows that while those with hypertension should primarily focus on reducing sodium to recommended levels, all groups should seek to maintain a healthy level of sodium intake of between 4 and 5 grams (equivalent to 10–13 g salt) a day.\nOne of the two most prominent dietary risks for disability in the world are diets high in sodium.\n\nNon-dietary uses\nOnly a small percentage of the salt manufactured in the world is used in food. The remainder is used in agriculture, water treatment, chemical production, de-icing, and other industrial use cases. In the practice of watering plants with salt as a fertilizer, applying a moderate concentration helps avoid potential toxicity; typically, 1–3 grams (0.035–0.106 oz) per liter is considered safe and effective for most plants. Sodium chloride is one of the most widely used inorganic raw materials. It is a feedstock in the production of  caustic soda and chlorine. These are used in the manufacture of PVC, paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic compounds.\nSalt is used as a flux in the production of aluminium. For this purpose, a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants. It is used in the manufacture of soaps and glycerine, where it is used to saponify fats. As an emulsifier, salt is used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber, and another use is in the firing of pottery, when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the ceramic material, forming a strong glaze.\nWhen drilling through loose materials such as sand or gravel, salt may be added to the drilling fluid to provide a stable \"wall\" to prevent the hole collapsing. There are many other processes in which salt is involved. These include its use as a mordant in textile dying, to regenerate resins in water softening, for the tanning of hides, the preservation of meat and fish and the canning of meat and vegetables.\n\nProduction\nFood-grade salt accounts for only a small part of salt production in industrialized countries (7% in Europe), although worldwide, food uses account for 17.5% of total production.\nIn 2018, total world production of salt was 300 million tonnes, the top six producers being China (68 million), the United States (42 million), India (29 million), Germany (13 million), Canada (13 million) and Australia (12 million).\nThe manufacture of salt is one of the oldest chemical industries. A major source of salt is seawater, which has a salinity of approximately 3.5%. This means that there are about 35 g (1.2 oz) of dissolved salts, predominantly sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions, per kilogram (2.2 lbs) of water. The world's oceans are a virtually inexhaustible source of salt, and this abundance of supply means that reserves have not been calculated. The evaporation of seawater is the production method of choice in marine countries with high evaporation and low precipitation rates. Salt evaporation ponds are filled from the ocean and salt crystals can be harvested as the water dries up. Sometimes these ponds have vivid colours, as some species of algae and other micro-organisms thrive in conditions of high salinity.\nAway from the sea, salt is extracted from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These sources are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, purification was achieved in shallow open pans that were heated to accelerate evaporation. Vacuum-based methods are also employed. \nThe raw salt is refined by treatment with chemicals that precipitate most impurities, largely magnesium and calcium salts. Multiple stages of evaporation are then applied. Some salt is produced using the Alberger process, which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake. The Ayoreo, an indigenous group from the Paraguayan Chaco, obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree (Maytenus vitis-idaea) and other trees.\nThe largest mine operated by underground workings in the world is the Sifto mine, located mostly 550 meters below Lake Huron, in Goderich, Ontario (Canada). About seven million tons of salt are extracted from it annually. The  Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan has nineteen storeys, eleven of which are underground, and 400 km (250 mi) of passages. The salt is dug out by the room and pillar method, where about half the material is left in place to support the upper levels. Extraction of Himalayan salt is expected to last 350 years at the present rate of extraction of around 385,000 tons per annum. The mine is also a major tourist attraction, receiving around a quarter of a million visitors a year.\n\nIn religion\nSalt has long held an important place in religion and culture. At the time of Brahmanic sacrifices, in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks at the time of the new moon, salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and some people think this to be the origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith. \nIn Judaism, it is recommended to have either a salty bread, or to add salt to the bread if this bread is unsalted when doing Kiddush for Shabbat. It is customary to spread some salt over the bread or dip it in a little salt when passing it around the table after the Kiddush. To preserve the covenant between their people and God, Jews dip the Sabbath bread in salt. \nSalt plays a role within different Christian traditions. It is mandatory in the rite of the Tridentine Mass. Salt is used in the third item (which includes an Exorcism) of the Celtic Consecration (cf. Gallican Rite) that is employed in the consecration of a church, and it is permitted to be added to the water \"where it is customary\" in the Roman Catholic rite of Holy water. \nThe Bible makes multiple mentions of salt, both of the mineral itself and as a metaphor. Uses include the tale of how Lot's wife is turned into a pillar of salt when looking back at the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah as they are destroyed. In the New Testament, Jesus refers to his followers as the \"salt of the earth\".\nIn Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water. Salt is an auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. In Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. Salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition. When returning home from a funeral, a pinch of salt is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. In Shinto, Shio (塩, lit. \"salt\") is used for ritual purification of locations and people (harae, specifically shubatsu), and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by entrances to ward off evil and to attract patrons.\n\nReferences\n\n\n=== Sources ===",

      "content": "ملح الطعام يتكون الملح المعروف بشكل رئيسي من مركب كيميائي يعرف بكلوريد الصوديوم (NaCl) والذي ينتمي لمجموعة أكبر من الأملاح. يوجد ملح الطعام في الطبيعة على هيئة بلّورات معدنية تُعرف بالملح الصخري أو الهاليت.  يوجد ملح الطعام بكثرة في ماء البحار حيث هو المُكَوِّن المعدني الرَّئيسي فيه. يحتوي المحيط على قرابة 35 جرام من الملح لكل لتر (oz 1.2) وملوحة 3.5%. يُعدُّ الملح ضروريًّا لحياة الحيوان،  ويتواجد في أنسجة الحيوانات أكثر من أنسجة النبّاتات. لذلك فإن نمط غذاء البدو المعتاد الذين يعيشون على قطعانهم لا يُحتاج فيه إلى الملح أو يُضاف بكميَّاتٍ قليلة، بينما نظام الغذاء المعتمد على القمح يحتاج إلى مكمّلات غذائية. وتعد الملوحة أحد أساسيّات حاسَّة التذوق لدى الإنسان. كما أن الملح من أقدم وأوفر التوابل، ويعد التمليح من أهم طرق حفظ الأطعمة.\nتشير بعض الأدلة إلى أن معالجة الملح تعود إلى 8000 سنة مضت، حيث كان سكان رومانيا يغلون مياه الينابيع لاستخراج الملح. كذلك عثر على أدوات لمعالجة الملح في الصين تعود إلى نفس الفترة تقريبًا. وكان يعد الملح ثمينًا عند اليهود قديمًا وكذلك عند كل من الإغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والحيثيّين والمصريّين. أصبح الملح سلعةً ثمينةً وكان يُنقَل بالقوارب عبر البحر المتوسط من خلال طرقٍ خاصَّةٍ بُنِيَت من أجل الملح وبقوافِل عبر الصحراء الكبرى. إن عوز الملح وحاجة الدول له أدت إلى نشوء حروب بينهم، واستعماله لزيادة عائدات الضرائب. كما يستعمل الملح في طقوس بعض الأديان وفي بعض الثقافات.\nتتم معالجة الملح من خلال مناجم الملح، أو عن طريق تبخير مياه البحار أو مياه الينابيع   المليئة بالمعادن.  إن أهم المنتجات الصناعية للملح هي الصودا الكاوية والكلور.  ويستخدم في عمليات صناعية أخرى كتصنيع البوليفنيل كلورايد والبلاستيك وأكوام الورق. إن من مجمل الإنتاج السنوي للملح البالغ قرابة المئتي مليون طن يستهلك الإنسان مايقارب 6% من هذا الإنتاج فقط. بينما يُستخدم الباقي في عمليات معالجة الماء، وإزالة الجليد عن الطرقات، وفي الزراعة. يُباع الملح القابل للأكل بهيئات مختلفة كالملح البحري، وملح الطاولة (ملح الطعام) والذي يكون معالج عادة باليود للحدّ من الإصابة بنقص اليود وكذلك يحتوي عادة على مواد مضادة للتكتل. وكذلك يوجد الملح في كثير من الأطعمة المُعالجة. يُعد الملح غذاء ضروريا، وتتأثر الصحة بمدى كميته في الغذاء. \nإنّ كثرة الملح قد يزيد من ضغط الدم وزيادة احتمالية الإصابة بسكتة أو نوبة قلبية عند بعض الأشخاص. تنصح منظمة الصحة العالمية بأن يستهلك البالغون أقل من 2000 ملي جرام من الصوديوم والذي يعادل 5 جرامات من الملح يوميًّا.\n\nالتاريخ\nعرف ملح الطعام منذ القدم لخصائصه، فاستعمل في الطبخ وكحافظ للأطعمة. واستعمله الإغريق والرومان واليهود في طقوسهم الدينية. اقتصادياً، اكتسب قيمة كبيرة. استعمل في الصين والحبشة للمقايضة وكعملة. في فرنسا، استحدثت ضريبة خاصة بالملح سميت «جبل» مما أثار الناس وكانت أحد أسباب الثورة الفرنسية.\nلطالما مال الناس لبناء مجتمعاتهم حول مصادر الملح، أو في مكان يستطيعون التجارة من أجله. \nوطوال التاريخ كان وجود الملح هامًّا للحضارات. فكلمة \"salary\" والتي تعني أجرة اشتقت من الملح باللاتينية;  نظرا لاستعمال الرومانيين الملحَ أحيانًا كأجرة، حيث كانت قيمته تعادل الذهب.  وفي بريطانيا يعد 'الملحق \"-ويتش\"wich-\" في نهاية أسماء الأماكن دلالة على كونه مصدرًا للملح في فترة من الفترات، كما في مدينتي ساندويتش ونوريتش.\n\nالتركيب الكيميائي\nيتركب الملح بشكل أساسي من المركب الأيوني كلوريد الصوديوم ذي الصيغة الكيميائية NaCl والذي يحتوي نسب متساوية من الصوديوم والكلور.. ويحتوي ملح البحر والملح المستخرج من المناجم (غالبا ما يكون مصدره ماء البحر من بحار عصر ما قبل التاريخ) على العناصر الزهيدة (والمفيدة بكميات قليلة لبعض الحيوانات والنباتات). تتم معالجة الملح المستخرج من المناجم (الملح المعدني) واستخدامه في إنتاج ملح الطعام (ملح الطاولة) عن طريق إذابته في الماء وتنقيته من خلال ترسيب باقي المعادن وإخراجها من المحلول ثم إعادة تبخيره. وغالبا ما يضاف اليود بعد هذه المعالجة. إن بلورات الملح شافَّة (شبه شفافة) غالبا ومكعبة الشكل، وتبدو بيضاء بالغالب لكن قد تعطيها بعض الشوائب لونا أزرق أو أرجواني. تساوي الكتلة المولية للملح 58.443 جم\\مول، ودرجة ذوبانه تساوي 801°م وتساوي درجة غليانه 1465°م. كما تساوي كثافته 2017 جم\\سم3. يُعد الملح سريع الذوبان في الماء ومعدل ذائبيته تساوي 359 جم\\لتر، وعندما يُذاب الملح فيه فإنه ينفصل إلى أيون الصوديوم +Na وأيون الكلوريد - Cl. إن تبلور محلول الماء والملح يُنتج ثنائي الهيدرات NaCl•2H2O. كما أن محاليل كلوريد الصوديوم مع الماء لها خصائص مختلفة عن المياه النقية; حيث تنخفض درجة التجمد إلى -21.12 °م عند كون كتلة الملح 23.31% من المحلول، ودرجة الذوبان لمحلول ملح مشبع تساوي تقريبا 108.7°م.\n\nملح الطعام\nيعد الملح هامًّا لصحة الإنسان والحيوان ويستخدم في مناطق كثيرة من العالم كتوابل. كما تعد الملوحة أهم حواس التذوق الخمسة الأساسية.\nملح الطعام هو ملح معالج يتكون 97%-%99 منه من كلوريد الصوديوم (NaCl) بالإضافة غالبا إلى موانع تكتُّل مثل ألومينوسيليكات الصوديوم أو كربونات المغنيسيوم لِتسهَّل من تدفقه. يتوافر الملح المعالج باليود والذي يحتوي يوديد الصوديوم في دول كثيرة˛ كما يضاف له مجفف أحيانًا كحبوب الأرز أو البسكويت المملح ليساعد على امتصاص الرطوبة وتكسير تكتلات الملح التي قد تنتج منها.\n\nالملح المدعَّم\nتتواجد بعض الإضافات في بعض أنواع ملح الطعام وذلك لتكميل النواقص الغذائية لتفادي بعض الأمراض وخاصة في الدول النامية. تختلف أنواع وكميات المواد المضافة من دولة لأخرى. يعد اليود من الأغذية المُحتاجة بكميَّات قليلة̨ ونقص في كمية هذا العنصر قد تؤدي إلى انخفاض إنتاج الثيروكسين (أحد هرمونات الغدة الدرقية) وبالتالي تحدث حالة قصور الدرقية وتضخم في هذه الغدَّة مما قد ينتج الفدامة عند الأطفال. بدأ استعمال الملح المعالج باليود لتفادي هذه الحالات منذ عام 1924 م. ويتكون هذا الملح من ملح الطعام مع كميات قليلة من يوديد البوتاسيوم أو يوديد الصوديوم أو يودات الصوديوم. كما قد يضاف سكّر أحادي يعرف بالدكستروز ليساعد على تثبيت وتوازن اليود. تُقدر حالات نقص اليود بالعالم إلى حوالي مئتي مليون شخص˛ وهو المسبب الأول الذي من الممكن تفاديه للتخلف العقلي. كما كان استخدام الملح المعالج باليود فعّالا لتفادي حالات نقص اليود.\nتختلف كمية اليود ومركباته من دولة لأخرى فالملح المعالج في الولايات المتحدة يحتوي على 46-77 جزيء من مليون جزيء˛ حيث تنصح هيئة الغذاء والدواء الأمريكية بتناول 150 مايكروجرام من اليود يوميًّا لكل من الذكور والإناث. بينما الكمية الموصى بوضعها في الملح في المملكة المتحدة هي 10-22 جزيء من المليون.\nيضاف حديدوسيانيد الصوديوم أحيانا مع ملح الطعام كمانع للتكتل. ويعد آمنًا للبشر بكميات قليلة حيث تم قبول أدلة عدم سميته كإضافة غذائية من قبل مجلس السموم عام 1988م. بدأ استعمال موانع التكتل عام 1911م عندما استخدم كربونات المغنيسيوم لتسهيل حركة الملح. تستعمل أحيانا بعض موانع التكتل الأخرى كفوسفات ثلاثي الكالسيوم ̨ كربونات المغنيسيوم أو الكالسيوم الملح الحمضي˛ أكسيد المغنيسيوم ˛ ثاني أكسيد السليكون ˛ سيليكات الكالسيوم ̨ ألومينيوسيليكات الصوديوم، وألومينيوسيليكات الكالسيوم. كل من الاتحاد الأوروبي وهيئة الغذاء والدواء الأمريكية سمحا باستعمال الألومنيوم مع المركبين الأخيرتي الذكر.\nيضاف كل من ملح الحديد وملح اليوديد في ما يسمى بتدعيم الملح الثنائي. تكمن فائدة ملح الحديد لتجنب فقر الدم الناجم عن عوز الحديد والذي يؤثر على النمو الذهني فيما يقارب 40% من الرضَّع في الدول النامية. يعد فومارات الحديد الثنائي هو المصدر الرئيسي للحديد.  أحد الإضافات المهمة الأخرى وخاصة للحوامل هي حمض الفوليك (فيتامين ب 9) والذي يعطي لونا أصفرا لملح الطعام. يساعد حمض الفوليك بالوقاية من عيب الأنبوب العصبي وفقر الدم.\nيعد كذلك نقص الفلورين في الحمية سببا لكثير من الإصابات بتسوس الأسنان. قد تضاف أملاح الفلوريد إلى ملح الطعام بهدف تقليل الإصابة بتسوس الأسنان وخاصة في الدول التي لم تستفد من إضاقة الفلور إلى الماء أو معجون الأسنان. ويعد هذا الفعل منتشرًا أكثر في الدول التي لا تضيف الفلور إلى ماء الشرب. 35% من ملح الطعام في فرنسا يحتوي على فلوريد الصوديوم.\n\nأنواع أخرى\nيحتوي الملح غير المعالج على كمّيات قليلة من المغنيسيوم وهاليدات الكالسيوم والكبريت وآثار منتجات الطحالب والجسيمات المترسبة وكذلك بعض البكتيريا المحبة للملوحة. يعطي الكالسيوم والمغنيسيوم قليلا من الطعم المر، ويعطيان الملح خاصية الاسترطاب (امتصاص الماء تدريجيا من الجو). تساهم منتجات الطحالب قليلا بإعطاء الملح رائحة شبيهة بالبحر أو السمك؛ لوجود مركبات البرومين العضوية. أما الجسيمات المترسبة فتعطيه مظهرا رصاصيا باهتا. ونظرًا لاستطاعة الإنسان شم وتذوق المركبات ذات الكميات الصغيرة، فإن الملح البحري عادة ما يكون ذا طعم أكثر تعقيدا من كلوريد الصوديوم النقي. وتشير الدراسات التابعة للملح الصخري بأن الملح البحري أو الصخري اللذان لم يعالجان لا يحتويان على كمية اليود الكافية للوقاية من أمراض نقص اليود. \nيختلف طعم ومدى ملوحة الملح الطبيعي باختلاف مصدره، مما يعطي نكهة خاصة له. ولزهرة الملح (ملح بحري يكون على سطح محاليل الملح المشبعة في الملَّاحات) طعم فريد يختلف من مكان لآخر حسب منطقة استخراجها. في أحد الأطباق الكورية التقليدية والذي يدعى بملح الخيزران يُجهَّز الطبق بتحميص الملح في حاوية من خيزران، وتغلق كلتا نهايتي الحاوية بالطين، حيث يمتص الملح المُحمَّص المعادن من الخيزران والطين. وهناك بعض الادعاءات أن هذا الطبق يزيد من خاصيتي منع تكسير الكروموسومات ومنع الطفرات الجينية الموجودة في طبق الدوينجانغ الكوري (عجينة فول الصويا المخمرة). \nلايحتوي ملح الكوشير على اليود على الرغم من معالجته، وحجم حباته أكبر من أغلب الأملاح المعالجة. مما قد يعطي خصائص مختلفة عند استخدامه بالطبخ، حيث يستعمل لتحضير لحم الكوشر. وليست كل المنتجات المصنفة كملح كوشير هي كذلك فعلًا بل يجب أن توثَّق من حاخام بأنها تطابق المتطلبات اللازمة لوصفها بذلك.\n\nالملح في الأطعمة\nيتواجد الملح بشكل طبيعي في كثير من المواد الغذائية كاللحوم والخضروات والفواكه، لكن بكميات صغيرة. وغالبا ما يضاف الملح للمواد الغذائية المعالجة كالأطعمة المعلبة والمخلَّلات والوجبات الخفيفة. حيث يستعمل لحفظ الطعام ولإضافة نكهة عند الأكل. تستخدم أملاح الألبان في تحضير كل من الزبدة والأجبان. كان الملح أحد أهم طرق حفظ الطعام قبل اختراع أجهزة التبريد الإلكترونية. فيحتوي سمك الرنجة 67 ملي جرام من الصوديوم لكل 100 جرام بينما يحتوي بعد تمليحه على 990 ملي جرام. وكذلك لحم الخنزير يحتوي على 63 ملي جرام بينما يحتوي بعد تمليحه على 1480 ملي جرام، أما البطاطس فيحتوي على 7 ملي جرام أما رقائق البطاطس المقلية فتحتوي على 800 ملي جرام لكل 100 جرام. إن مصادر الملح الطبيعية دون الاستعمال المباشر لكلوريد الصوديوم هي الخبز ومنتجات القمح واللحوم والحليب ومشتقاته.\nلا يضاف الملح كتوابل في كثير من دول شرق آسيا، وإنما يتم استعمال صلصة الصويا أو صلصة السمك أو صلصة المحار واللاتي يحتوين على كمية عالية من الصوديوم حيث يعدن بديلا لملح الطعام المستخدم في المجتمعات الغربية، وغالبا ما تضاف هذه الصلصات مع الطهي وليس بعده.\n\nالنظام الغذائي والصحة\nتعد كمية الصوديوم قرابة 40% من كتلة ملح الطعام، حيث يحتوي 6 جرام من الملح (ملعقة صغيرة) على ما يقارب 2300 ملي جرام من الصوديوم. للصوديوم دور مهم في جسم الإنسان حيث يساعد الأعصاب والعضلات على القيام بمهمتها بالشكل الصحيح، وكذلك يعد أحد العوامل المهمة لتنظيم الماء والسوائل داخل الجسم. يعد الملح مصدر الصوديوم الأساسي في المجتمعات الغربية، وكمية استهلاكهم للملح تعادل 10 جرام يوميًّا مما يعد أكثر من أغلب دول آسيا وشرق أوروبا. إن لمستويات الصوديوم العالية في كثير من الأطعمة المعالجة أثرًا على الكمية الكليَّة المستهلكة. حيث 77% من الصوديوم المستهلك في الولايات المتحدة مصدره وجبات المطاعم والأغذية المعالجة، و11% من إضافة ملح الطعام، أما الباقي فيكون متواجد بشكل طبيعي في الغذاء.\nيُعد الإكثار من الملح مضرًّا للصحة وتوصي منظمة الصحة العالمية بتقليل استهلاك الملح. يرتبط زيادة استهلاك الملح مع ارتفاع خطورة الإصابة بسكتة والأمراض القلبية الوعائية بشكل عام. يعد تقليل استهلاك الملح بمقدار 1000 ملي جرام مساعدًا على تقليل احتمالية الإصابة بالأمراض القلبية الوعائية بما يقارب 30%. تقليل كميات الصوديوم المستهلكة عادة بشكلٍ عالٍ في الأشخاص الذين لا يعانون من أمراض حادة يساعد على خفض ضغط الدم وتكون النتائج أفضل عند المصابين بفرط ضغط الدم. وعلى الرغم من ذلك لا توجد آثار واضحة للتوصيات بتقليل استهلاك الصوديوم.\nتوصي منظمة الصحة العالمية أن يكون استهلاك الأشخاص البالغين أقل من 2000 ملي جرام من الصوديوم يوميًّا (ما يقارب 5 ملي جرام من الملح). وتوصي إرشادات الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية لعام 2010 م أن لا يتجاوز استهلاك كل من المصابين بفرط ضغط الدم والأمريكيين من أصل أفريقي ومتوسطي العمر وكبار السن 1500 ملي جرام من الصوديوم يوميًّا وأن يكملوا احتياجات الجسم للبوتاسيوم حيث تنص التوصيات على أخذ 4700 ملي جرام يوميًّا والمتواجدة في الخضروات والفواكه.\nوإفادة تقليل استهلاك الصوديوم بشكل كبير هي مسألة مُختلف عليها. حيث يوصي تقرير لعام 2013 بألا يقلَّ استهلاك الفرد عن 1200 ملي جرام من الصوديوم يوميًّا (3 جرام من الملح). بينما ينص تقريرين لعام 2013 وعام 2015 على عدم وجود دليل كافٍ على أن تقليل الصوديوم أقل من 2300 ملي جرام يوميًّا ذا فائدة. وقد يكون النظام الغذائي ذا الصوديوم القليل أضرّ من النظام الغذائي الذي يحتوي على مستوى صوديوم مرتفع قليلًا. ويشكك البعض في الترابط بين استعمال الملح في الأكل والأمراض القلبية الوعائية عند عامة الناس.\n\nالملح في غير الأطعمة\nقرابة 6% فقط من الملح المنتج يستخدم للغذاء. أما الباقي ف 12% تستخدم في معالجة وإزالة قساوة الماء، و8% تستخدم لإزالة الجليد عن الطرقات و6% تستخدم في الزراعة. أما الباقي (68%) فيستخدم في العمليات الصناعية، حيث يعد كلوريد الصوديوم من أكثر المواد الخام غير العضوية المستعملة في الصناعة. وأهم منتجات كلوريد الصوديوم هي الصودا الكاوية والكلور، وتتم عملية فصل كلوريد الصوديوم عن طريق عملية التحليل الكهربائي لمحلول ملح نقي. وتستعمل هذه المنتجات في تصنيع كلوريد متعدد الفاينيل ومنتجات البلاستيك ولب الورق بالإضافة لمنتجات أخرى عضوية وغير عضوية. يستخدم كذلك الملح كقالب لتصنيع الألومنيوم؛ لذلك توجد طبقة من الملح الذائب تطفو فوق المعدن الذائب وتزيل الحديد والمعادن المُلوِّثة الأخرى. ويستخدم بالإضافة إلى ذلك في تصنيع الصابون والجلسرين حيث يضاف إلى وعاء لترسيب المنتجات المُتَصَبِّنَة. ويستخدم أيضًا في تصنيع المطاط الاصطناعي، والخزف حيث يتبخر الملح ويتكثف على سطح السيراميك منتجا لمعة في عملية تعرف بتزجيج الخزف.\nيُضاف الملح إلى سائل الحفر عند حفر مادة رخوة كالرمل أو الحصى لمنح دعامة ومنع ما حول الحفرة من الانهيار. يستخدم كذلك في عمليات عديدة: كترسيخ الألوان عند صبغ النسيج، وإعادة تكوين الراتنج في عملية إزالة قساوة الماء، ودباغة الجلود، وتعليب اللحوم والخضروات.\n\nالإنتاج\nيعد إنتاج الملح من أقدم الصناعات الكيميائية. وأحد أهم المصادر له هو ماء البحر الذي تساوي ملوحته تقريبا 3,5% والذي يعني أن يوجد 35 جم من الملح المُذاب لكل كجم من ماء البحر. تعتبر المحيطات مصدر ملح غير ناضب وبسبب هذه الوفرة في المصادر فإنه لم يتم حساب مخزون الملح. ويعد تبخير ماء البحر هو الخيار المثالي لإنتاج الملح للمدن الساحلية ذات مدى تبخّر عالٍ وترسب منخفض. تمتلئ الملّاحات بماء المحيطات ومن الممكن حصد بلورات الملح بعد جفاف الماء. تمتلك هذه المحاليل ألوانا بارزة نظرًا لوجود بعض أنواع الطحالب والمخلوقات المجهرية المحبة للملوحة والتي تنمو في هذه البيئة.\n\nالملح في الأديان\nلطالما كان للملح مكانة مهمة في كثير من الأديان والثقافات. يُرمى الملح عادة على النار لإصدار بعض الضجيج والفرقعة في الديانة الفيدية وفي بعض طقوس الحيثيِّين واحتفالات الساميين والإغريق عند حلول الأشهر القمرية. كان المصريون القدماء والإغريق الرومان يتقربون إلى آلهتهم بتقريب الملح والماء، ويعتقد البعض أن هذا منشأ وأصل الماء المقدس في المعتقد المسيحي. وعند الأزتيك كانت يوكسيسواتل (Huixtocihuatl) آلهة الإخصاب والتي تستجيب عند تقريب الماء والملح، كما تسمى بآلهة الملح.\nوقد روى ابن ماجه في سننه من حديث أنس بن مالك رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال: سيد إدامكم الملح. (ضعَّفه الألباني.)\nويعد الملح في الهندوسية مبشِّرًا وجالبا للحظ حيث كان يستعمل في بعض الطقوس الدينية وعند الزواج. أما معتنقي ديانة الجاينية فيقدمون أرزا غير مطبوخ مع قليل من الملح للآلهة كي يثبتوا مدى التزامهم بهذا الدين، وكذلك فإنهم ينثرون الملح على بقايا جثة الميت بعد حرقها قبل دفن الرماد. كما يعتقد معتنقو الماهايانية بأن الملح يطرد الأرواح الشريرة، فعند عودتهم من المقبرة ينثرون بعضا من الملح على كتفهم الأيسر لطرد هذه الأرواح ومنعها من دخول المنزل. وفي بعض الطقوس الشنتوية فإن الملح يستخدم في تطهير الأماكن والأشخاص وتوضع أكوام الملح على أطباق عند مداخل المؤسسات طردا للأرواح الشريرة وجلبا لأصحاب الأموال.\nوفي الكتاب العبري (التوراة) ذُكر الملح قرابة 35 مرة، أحدهم في قصة زوجة لوط - عليه السلام- حيث حوِّلت إلى عمود ملح عندما التفتت إلى قريتي سدوم وعمورة عند تدميرهما (سفر التكوين). وكما قام القاضي أبو معيلق عند تدميره مدينة شكيم برش الملح كلعنة على من يسكن هذه الأرض مرة أخرى. وفي سفر أيوب تم ذكر الملح للمرة الأولى كبهارات. وفي كتب العهد الجديد ذكر الملح ست مرات ويذكرون بأن المسيح أشار لأتباعه بأنهم «ملح الأرض». كما يستخدم الملح عند طرد الأرواح الشريرة، وأحيانا يُضاف للماء ويستعمل عند ترسيم الكهنة.\nوعند اليهود فيجب تواجد كل من الماء والملح عند المذبح، وفي طقوس واحتفالات أخرى.\n\nانظر أيضًا\nبدائل الملح\nمستنقعات الملح\n\n\n== مراجع ==",
      "summary": "ملح الطعام يتكون الملح المعروف بشكل رئيسي من مركب كيميائي يعرف بكلوريد الصوديوم (NaCl) والذي ينتمي لمجموعة أكبر من الأملاح. يوجد ملح الطعام في الطبيعة على هيئة بلّورات معدنية تُعرف بالملح الصخري أو الهاليت.  يوجد ملح الطعام بكثرة في ماء البحار حيث هو المُكَوِّن المعدني الرَّئيسي فيه. يحتوي المحيط على قرابة 35 جرام من الملح لكل لتر (oz 1.2) وملوحة 3.5%. يُعدُّ الملح ضروريًّا لحياة الحيوان،  ويتواجد في أنسجة الحيوانات أكثر من أنسجة النبّاتات. لذلك فإن نمط غذاء البدو المعتاد الذين يعيشون على قطعانهم لا يُحتاج فيه إلى الملح أو يُضاف بكميَّاتٍ قليلة، بينما نظام الغذاء المعتمد على القمح يحتاج إلى مكمّلات غذائية. وتعد الملوحة أحد أساسيّات حاسَّة التذوق لدى الإنسان. كما أن الملح من أقدم وأوفر التوابل، ويعد التمليح من أهم طرق حفظ الأطعمة.\nتشير بعض الأدلة إلى أن معالجة الملح تعود إلى 8000 سنة مضت، حيث كان سكان رومانيا يغلون مياه الينابيع لاستخراج الملح. كذلك عثر على أدوات لمعالجة الملح في الصين تعود إلى نفس الفترة تقريبًا. وكان يعد الملح ثمينًا عند اليهود قديمًا وكذلك عند كل من الإغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والحيثيّين والمصريّين. أصبح الملح سلعةً ثمينةً وكان يُنقَل بالقوارب عبر البحر المتوسط من خلال طرقٍ خاصَّةٍ بُنِيَت من أجل الملح وبقوافِل عبر الصحراء الكبرى. إن عوز الملح وحاجة الدول له أدت إلى نشوء حروب بينهم، واستعماله لزيادة عائدات الضرائب. كما يستعمل الملح في طقوس بعض الأديان وفي بعض الثقافات.\nتتم معالجة الملح من خلال مناجم الملح، أو عن طريق تبخير مياه البحار أو مياه الينابيع   المليئة بالمعادن.  إن أهم المنتجات الصناعية للملح هي الصودا الكاوية والكلور.  ويستخدم في عمليات صناعية أخرى كتصنيع البوليفنيل كلورايد والبلاستيك وأكوام الورق. إن من مجمل الإنتاج السنوي للملح البالغ قرابة المئتي مليون طن يستهلك الإنسان مايقارب 6% من هذا الإنتاج فقط. بينما يُستخدم الباقي في عمليات معالجة الماء، وإزالة الجليد عن الطرقات، وفي الزراعة. يُباع الملح القابل للأكل بهيئات مختلفة كالملح البحري، وملح الطاولة (ملح الطعام) والذي يكون معالج عادة باليود للحدّ من الإصابة بنقص اليود وكذلك يحتوي عادة على مواد مضادة للتكتل. وكذلك يوجد الملح في كثير من الأطعمة المُعالجة. يُعد الملح غذاء ضروريا، وتتأثر الصحة بمدى كميته في الغذاء. \nإنّ كثرة الملح قد يزيد من ضغط الدم وزيادة احتمالية الإصابة بسكتة أو نوبة قلبية عند بعض الأشخاص. تنصح منظمة الصحة العالمية بأن يستهلك البالغون أقل من 2000 ملي جرام من الصوديوم والذي يعادل 5 جرامات من الملح يوميًّا.",
