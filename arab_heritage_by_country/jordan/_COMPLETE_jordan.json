          "content": "Amman is the capital and the largest city of Jordan, and the country's economic, political, and cultural center. With a population of five million as of 2024, Amman is Jordan's primate city and is the largest city in the Levant region, the fifth-largest city in the Arab world, and the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East.\nAmman is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman dates to the 8th millennium BC in 'Ain Ghazal, home to the world's oldest statues of the human form. During the Iron Age, the city was known as Rabat Aman, the capital of the Ammonite Kingdom. In the 3rd century BC, the city was renamed Philadelphia and became one of the ten Greco-Roman cities of the Decapolis. Later, in the 7th century AD, the Rashidun Caliphate renamed the city Amman. Throughout most of the Islamic era, the city alternated between periods of devastation and periods of relative prosperity. Amman was largely abandoned during the Ottoman period from the 15th century until 1878, when it was resettled by Circassians. The city grew after it was connected to the Hejaz Railway in 1904, leading to the formation of its first municipal council in 1909.\nAmman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan's capital in 1921, receiving migrations from different Jordanian and Levantine cities, and later several successive waves of refugees: Palestinians in 1948 and 1967; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003; and Syrians since 2011. It was initially built on seven hills, but now spans over 19 hills combining 22 areas, which are administered by the Greater Amman Municipality. Areas of Amman have gained their names from either the hills (jabal) or the valleys (wadi) they occupy, such as Jabal al-Luweibdeh and Wadi Abdoun. East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities, while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city.\nApproximately one million visitors arrived in Amman in 2018, which made it the 89th most-visited city in the world and the 12th most-visited Arab city. Amman has a relatively fast growing economy and it is ranked as a Beta− global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Moreover, it was named one of the Middle East and North Africa's best cities according to economic, labor, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. The city is among the most popular locations in the Arab world for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices, alongside Doha and only behind Dubai. Amman has a bus network, including a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system that serves the city and connects it to neighboring Zarqa.\n\nEtymology\nAmman derives its name from the ancient people of the Ammonites, whose capital the city had been since the 13th century BC. The Ammonites named it Rabat ʿAmmān (𐤓𐤁𐤕 𐤏𐤌𐤍), with the term Rabat meaning the \"Capital\" or the \"King's Quarters\". In the Hebrew Bible, the town is referred to as Rabbaṯ Bənē ʿAmmōn (רַבַּת בְּנֵי עַמּוֹן) or simply Rabbā (רַבָּה), and it appears in English translations as \"Rabbah of the Ammonites,\" \"Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, or \"Rabbath Ammon.\" Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the Macedonian ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom who reigned from 283 to 246 BC, renamed the city Philadelphia (Ancient Greek: Φιλαδέλφεια; literally: \"brotherly love\"), after himself, after occupying it. By the Islamic era, the Rashidun Caliphate restored its ancient Semitic name and called it Amman in the 7th century AD.\n\nHistory\nNeolithic period\nThe Neolithic site of ʿAin Ghazal today lies in the outskirts of Amman. At its height, around 7000 BC (9000 years ago), it had an area of 15 hectares (37 acres) and was inhabited by ca. 3000 people (four to five times the population of contemporary Jericho). At that time, the site was a typical aceramic Neolithic village. Its houses were rectangular mud-bricked buildings that included a main square living room, whose walls were made up of lime plaster. The site was discovered in 1974 as construction workers were working on a road crossing the area. By 1982, when the excavations started, around 600 meters (2,000 feet) of road ran through the site. Despite the damage brought by urban expansion, the remains of ʿAin Ghazal provided a wealth of information.\nʿAin Ghazal is well known for a set of small human statues found in 1983, when local archeologists stumbled upon the edge of a large pit containing them. These statues are human figures made with white plaster, with painted eyes. Thirty-two figures were found in two caches, fifteen of them full figures, fifteen busts, and two fragmentary heads. Three of the busts depicted two-headed characters, the significance of which is not clear.\n\nIron Age: the Ammonites\nIn the 13th century BC, Amman was the capital of the Ammonite Kingdom, and became known as \"Rabat Amman\". Rabat Amman provided several natural resources to the region, including sandstone and limestone, along with a productive agricultural sector that made it a vital location along the King's Highway, the ancient trade route connecting Egypt with Mesopotamia, Syria and Anatolia. As with the Edomites and Moabites, trade along this route gave the Ammonites considerable revenue. Milcom is named in the Hebrew Bible as the national god of Rabat Amman. Another ancient deity, Moloch, usually associated with the use of children as offerings, is also mentioned in the Bible as a god of the Ammonites, but this is probably a mistake for Milcom. However, excavations by archeologists near Amman Civil Airport uncovered a temple, which included an altar containing many human bone fragments. The bones showed evidence of burning, which led to the assumption that the altar functioned as a pyre and used for human sacrifice.\nAmman is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible. According to the biblical narrative, the Ammonite king Hanun allied with Hadadezer, king of Aram-Zobah, against the United Kingdom of Israel. During the war, Joab, the captain of King David's army, laid siege to Rabbah, Hanun's royal capital, and destroyed it (2 Samuel 12:26–28, 1 Chronicles 20:1–2). David took a great quantity of plunder from the city, including the king's crown, and brought it to his capital, Jerusalem (2 Samuel 12:29–31). Hanun's brother, Shobi, was made king in his place, and became a loyal vassal of David (2 Samuel 17:27). Hundreds of years later, the prophet Jeremiah foresaw the coming destruction and final desolation of the city (Jeremiah 49:2).\nSeveral Ammonite ruins across Amman exist, such as Rujm Al-Malfouf and some parts of the Amman Citadel. The ruins of Rujm Al-Malfouf consist of a stone watchtower used to ensure the protection of their capital and several store rooms to the east. The city was later conquered by the Assyrians, followed by the Babylonians and the Achaemenid Persians.\n\nClassical and late antiquity\nHellenistic period\nConquest of the Near East by Alexander the Great firmly consolidated the influence of Hellenistic culture, marking the start of the Hellenistic period. Little is known about Greek/Macedonian control over the Levantine coast and Transjordan until 301 BCE, 22 years after Alexander's death, when the Ptolemies took control over this area. The Greeks founded new cities in the area of modern-day Jordan, including Gadara (Umm Qays), Gerasa (Jerash), Pella (Tabaqat Fahl) and Philadelphia (Amman). Ptolemy II nicknamed Philadelphus, the Macedonian ruler of Egypt, established in or before 259/58 BCE at the site of Amman what was initially probably a military colony, which then developed into a full-blown Greek-type polis, possibly by settling there Hellenised Tyrean colonists. Ptolemy II named it Philadelphia (Ancient Greek: Φιλαδέλφεια, romanized: Philadelpheia), evoking \"brotherly love\" in Greek, in adulation to his own nickname.\nWritten sources speak of members of the Jewish Tobiad family based in Jerusalem, who worked for the Ptolemies as tax collectors in charge of the entire region. The last known Tobiad, Hyrcanus, built the unique Hellenistic palace of Tyros (today's Qasr al-Abd, 'Castle of the Slave') southwest of Philadelpheia, before killing himself in c. 170-168 BC as the Seleucid king Antiochus IV seemed poised to attack him. This was one of several episodes in the Syrian Wars between the Seleucids and the Ptolemies, ending with the 200 BCE victory of the Seleucids at the Battle of Panium. In 218/17 BCE for instance, Seleucid king Antiochus III destroyed the Ptolemaic garrisons in the centre of Transjordan, capturing Philadelpheia in the process. Even after 200 BCE, Philadelpheia seems to have broken free at times from Seleucid rule and probably also escaped capture by Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaios (r. c. 103 – c. 76 BCE), who was more successful elsewhere in the region. Other Hasmonean and Nabataean rulers acted as regional power brokers, contributing to the instability of the political situation during the 2nd century BCE and until the advent of the Roman period in the following century, which led to the Hellenisation of the region only truly setting in under the Romans.\n\nRoman period\nThe Romans conquered much of the Levant in 63 BC, inaugurating a period of imperial rule conducted from Rome that lasted for four centuries. In the northern parts of modern-day Jordan, the Greek cities of Philadelphia (Amman), Gerasa, Gedara, Pella and Arbila joined with other cities in Palestine and southern parts of today's Syria to form the Decapolis League, a confederation based on common economic and cultural interests (see also Scythopolis, Hippos, Capitolias, Canatha and Damascus). Philadelphia became a point along a road stretching from Ailah to Damascus that was built by Emperor Trajan in AD 106. This provided an economic boost for the city in a short period of time.\nThere are traces of Roman construction all across Jordan. In Amman the most conspicuous structures include the Great Temple (inaccurately known as the \"Temple of Hercules\") at the Amman Citadel, the Roman Theatre, the Odeon, and the Nymphaeum. The two theaters and the nymphaeum fountain were built during the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius around AD 161. The theatre was the larger venue of the two and had a capacity for 6,000 attendees. It was oriented north and built into the hillside, to protect the audience from the sun. To the northeast of the theatre was a small odeon. Built at roughly the same time as the theatre, the Odeon had 500 seats and is still in use today for music concerts. Archaeologists speculate that the structure was originally covered with a wooden roof to shield the audience from the weather. The Nymphaeum is situated southwest of the Odeon and served as Philadelphia's chief fountain. The Nymphaeum is believed to have contained a 600 square meters (6,500 sq ft) pool which was 3 meters (9.8 ft) deep and was continuously refilled with water.\n\nByzantine period\nDuring the late Byzantine period in the seventh century, several bishops were based in the city; a number of church sites from the Byzantine period have been discovered there - see List of Byzantine churches in Amman.\n\nEarly Muslim period (7th–11th century)\nIn the 630s, the Rashidun Caliphate conquered the region from the Byzantines, beginning the Islamic era in the Levant. Philadelphia was renamed \"Amman\" by the Muslims and became part of the district of Jund Dimashq. A large part of the population already spoke Arabic, which facilitated integration into the caliphate, as well as several conversions to Islam. Under the Umayyad caliphs who began their rule in 661 AD, numerous desert castles were established as a means to govern the desert area of modern-day Jordan, several of which are still well-preserved. Amman had already been functioning as an administrative centre. The Umayyads built a large palace on the Amman Citadel hill, known today as the Umayyad Palace. Amman was later destroyed by several earthquakes and natural disasters, including a particularly severe earthquake in 749. The Umayyads were overthrown by the Abbasids three years later.\nAmman's importance declined by the mid-8th century after damage caused by several earthquakes rendered it uninhabitable. Excavations among the collapsed layer of the Umayyad Palace have revealed remains of kilns from the time of the Abbasids (750–969) and the Fatimids (969–1099). In the late 9th century, Amman was noted as the \"capital\" of the Balqa by geographer al-Yaqubi. Likewise, in 985, the Jerusalemite historian al-Muqaddasi described Amman as the capital of Balqa, that it was a town in the desert fringe of Syria surrounded by villages and cornfields and a regional source of lambs, grain and honey. Its inhabitants he reports, at the time, were Shia Muslims. Furthermore, al-Muqaddasi describes Amman as a \"harbor of the desert\" where Arab Bedouin would take refuge, and that its citadel, which overlooked the town, contained a small mosque.\n\nCrusaders and Ayyubids (12th–13th century)\nThe occupation of the Citadel Hill by the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem is so far based only on interpretations of Crusader sources. William of Tyre writes in his Historia that in 1161 Philip of Milly received the castle of Ahamant, which is seen to refer to Amman, as part of the lordship of Oultrejordain. In 1166 Philip joined the military order of the Knights Templar, passing on to them a significant part of his fief including the castle of Ahamant or \"Haman\", as it is named in the deed of confirmation issued by King Amalric. By 1170, Amman was in Ayyubid hands. The remains of a watch tower on Citadel Hill, first attributed to the Crusaders, now are preferentially dated to the Ayyubid period, leaving it to further research to find the location of the Crusader castle. During the Ayyubid period, the Damascene geographer al-Dimashqi wrote that Amman was part of the province of al-Karak, although \"only ruins\" remained of the town.\n\nMamluk period (13th–early 16th century)\nDuring the Mamluk era (late 13th–early 16th century), the region of Amman was a part of Wilayat Balqa, the southernmost district of Mamlakat Dimashq (Damascus Province). The capital of the district in the first half of the 14th century was the minor administrative post of Hisban, which had a considerably smaller garrison than the other administrative centers in Transjordan, namely Ajlun and al-Karak.  In 1321, the geographer Abu'l Fida, recorded that Amman was \"a very ancient town\" with fertile soil and surrounded by agricultural fields. For unclear, though likely financial reasons, in 1356, the capital of Balqa was transferred from Hisban to Amman, which was considered a madina (city). In 1357, Emir Sirghitmish bought Amman in its entirety, most likely to use revenues from the city to help fund the Madrasa of Sirghitmish, which he built in Cairo that same year. After his purchase of the city, Sirghitmish transferred the courts, administrative bureaucracy, markets and most of the inhabitants of Hisban to Amman. Moreover, he financed new building works in the city.\nOwnership of Amman following Sirghitmish's death in 1358 passed to successive generations of his descendants until 1395, when his descendants sold it to Emir Baydamur al-Khwarazmi, the na'ib as-saltana (viceroy) of Damascus. Afterward, part of Amman's cultivable lands were sold to Emir Sudun al-Shaykhuni (died 1396), the na'ib as-saltana of Egypt. The increasingly frequent division and sale of the city and lands of Amman to different owners signalled declining revenues coming from Amman, while at the same time, Hisban was restored as the major city of the Balqa in the 15th century. From then until 1878, Amman was an abandoned site periodically used to shelter seasonal farmers who cultivated arable lands in its vicinity and by Bedouin tribes who used its pastures and water. The Ottoman Empire annexed the region of Amman in 1516, but for much of the Ottoman period, al-Salt functioned as the virtual political center of Transjordan.\n\nModern era (1878–present)\nLate Ottoman period (1878–1917)\nAmman began to be resettled in 1878, when several hundred Muslim Circassians arrived following their expulsion from the North Caucasus by the Russian Empire during the events of the Russo-Circassian War. Between 1878 and 1910, tens of thousands of Circassians became refugees in the Ottoman Empire, which had moved large numbers of them into its province of Syria. The Ottoman authorities directed the Circassians, who were mainly of peasant stock, to settle in Amman, and distributed arable land among them. Their settlement was a partial manifestation of the Ottoman statesman Kamil Pasha's project, which did not materialize, to establish the Amman Province (vilayet) which, along with other sites in its vicinity, would become Circassian-populated townships guaranteeing the security of the Damascus–Medina highway. The first Circassian settlers, who belonged to the Shapsug tribe, lived near Amman's Roman theater and incorporated its stones into the houses they built. The English traveller Laurence Oliphant noted in his 1879 visit that most of the original Circassian settlers had left Amman by then, with about 150 remaining. They were joined by Circassians from the Kabardian and Abzakh tribes in 1880–1892.\n\nUntil 1900 settlement was concentrated in the valley and slopes of the Amman stream and settlers built mud-brick houses with wooden roofs. The French Dominican priest Marie-Joseph Lagrange commented in 1890 about Amman: \"A mosque, the ancient bridges, all that jumbled with the houses of the Circassians gives Amman a remarkable physiognomy\". The new village became a nahiye (subdistrict) center of the kaza of al-Salt in the Karak Sanjak established in 1894. By 1908 Amman contained 800 houses divided between three main quarters, Shapsug, Kabartai and Abzakh, each called after the Circassian groupings which respectively settled there, a number of mosques, open-air markets, shops, bakeries, mills, a textile factory, a post and telegraph office and a government compound (saraya). Kurdish settlers formed their own quarter called \"al-Akrad\" after them, while a number of townspeople from nearby al-Salt and al-Fuheis, seeking to avoid high taxes and conscription or attracted by financial incentives, and traders from Najd and Morocco, had also moved to the town.\n\nThe city's demographics changed dramatically after the Ottoman government's decision to construct the Hejaz Railway, which linked Damascus and Medina, and facilitated the annual Hajj pilgrimage and trade. Operational in central Transjordan since 1903, the Hejaz Railway helped to transform Amman from a small village into a major commercial hub in the region. Circassian entrepreneurship, facilitated by the railway, helped to attract investment from merchants from Damascus, Nablus, and Jerusalem, many of whom moved to Amman in the 1900s and 1910s. Some of the Arab families who arrived from surrounding regions during this period include Hudhud, Malas, Idlibi, Bdeir, Haddad, and Kawar. Although they settled after the local Circassian population and Bedouins of Jordan, they earned the nickname 'Founding Families of Amman' for establishing key institutions such as pharmacies and construction firms, and for bringing goods and expertise from their more developed cities of origion. Amman's first municipal council was established in 1909, and Circassian Ismael Babouk was elected as its mayor.\n\nFirst World War\nThe First and Second Battle of Amman were part of the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I and the Arab Revolt, taking place in 1918. Amman had a strategic location along the Hejaz Railway; its capture by British forces and the Hashemite Arab army facilitated the British advance towards Damascus. The second battle was won by the British, resulting in the establishment of the British Mandate.\n\nBritish Mandate; Emirate of Transjordan (1921–1946)\nIn 1921, the Hashemite emir and later king Abdullah I designated Amman instead of al-Salt to be the capital of the newly created state, the Emirate of Transjordan, which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1950. Its function as the capital of the country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the Jordan River at the time. The early settlers who came from Palestine were overwhelmingly from Nablus, from which many of al-Salt's inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus. Amman later attracted people from the southern part of the country, particularly al-Karak and Madaba. The city's population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.\nThe British report from 1933 shows around 1,700 Circassians living in Amman. Yet the community was far from insulated. Local urban and nomadic communities formed alliances with the Circassians, some of which are still present today. This cemented the status of Circassians in the re-established city.\n\nPost-independence (1946–present)\nJordan gained its independence in 1946 and Amman was designated the country's capital. Amman received many refugees during wartime events in nearby countries, beginning with the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. A second wave arrived after the Six-Day War in 1967. In 1970, Amman was a battlefield during the conflict between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Jordanian Army known as Black September. The Jordanian Army defeated the PLO in 1971, and the latter were expelled to Lebanon. The first wave of Iraqi refugees settled in the city after the 1991 Gulf War, with a second wave occurring in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nOn 9 November 2005, Al-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's leadership launched coordinated explosions in three hotel lobbies in Amman, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. Jordan's security as a whole was dramatically improved after the attack, and no major terrorist attacks have been reported since then. Most recently a wave of Syrian refugees have arrived in the city during the ongoing Syrian Civil War which began in 2011. Amman was a principal destination for refugees for the security and prosperity it offered.\nDuring the 2010s, the city has experienced an economic, cultural and urban boom. The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation, and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace. This strained Jordan's scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers of quick expansion without careful municipal planning.\n\nGeography\nAmman is situated on the East Bank Plateau, an upland characterized by three major wadis which run through it. Originally, the city had been built on seven hills. Amman's terrain is typified by its mountains. The most important areas in the city are named after the hills or mountains they lie on. The area's elevation ranges from 700 to 1,100 m (2,300 to 3,600 ft). Al-Salt and al-Zarqa are located to the northwest and northeast, respectively, Madaba is located to the west, and al-Karak and Ma'an are to Amman's southwest and southeast, respectively. One of the only remaining springs in Amman now supplies the Zarqa River with water. Trees found in Amman include Aleppo pine, Mediterranean cypress and Phoenician juniper.\n\nClimate\nAmman features a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa) in its western and northern neighborhoods, while its eastern and southern neighborhoods experience a semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh/BSk).\nThe summer season in Amman is moderately long, characterized by mild heat and refreshing breezes. However, occasional heatwaves may occur during this period. Spring is brief yet warm, with temperatures reaching highs of 28 °C (82 °F). This season typically commences between April and May, lasting for about a month. Winter usually sets in around the end of November, extending through early to mid-March. During winter, temperatures typically hover around or below 17 °C (63 °F), with sporadic snowfall occurring once or twice a year.\nThe average annual rainfall in Amman is around 385 mm (15 in), with great variations between different parts of the city. The western areas receive more than 500 mm (20 in) of rainfall, whereas the eastern areas receive less than 250 mm (10 in). Rainfall primarily occurs between November and April, and periodic droughts are not uncommon.\nAmman experiences heavy fog on about 120 days each year. The city's diverse weather conditions are heavily influenced by differences in elevation. While snow might accumulate in the higher-altitude western and northern regions of Amman (with an average altitude of 1,000 m or 3,300 ft above sea level), the city center (at an elevation of 700 m or 2,300 ft) might experience rainfall simultaneously. This variation in elevation leads to extreme microclimates within Amman, with each district having its own distinct weather patterns.\n\nLocal government\nAmman is governed by a 41-member city council elected directly for terms of four years. All Jordanian citizens above 18 years old are eligible to vote in the municipal elections. However, the mayor is appointed by the king and not through elections. In 1909 a city council was established in Amman by Circassian Ismael Babouk who became the first-ever mayor of the capital, and in 1914 Amman's first city district center was founded.\nThe Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) has been investing in making the city a better place, through a number of initiatives. Green Amman 2020 was initiated in 2014, aiming to turn the city to a green metropolis by 2020. According to official statistics, only 2.5% of Amman is green space. In 2015 GAM and Zain Jordan started operating free-of-charge Wi-Fi services at 15 locations, including Wakalat Street, Rainbow Street, The Hashemite Plaza, Ashrafieh Cultural Complex, Zaha Cultural Center, Al Hussein Cultural Center, Al Hussein Public Parks and others.\n\nAdministrative divisions\nJordan is divided into twelve administrative divisions, each called a governorate. Amman Governorate divides into nine districts, five of which are divided into sub-districts. The Greater Amman Municipality has 22 areas which are further divided into neighborhoods.\nThe city is administered as the Greater Amman Municipality and covers 22 areas which include:\n\nEconomy\nBanking sector\nThe banking sector is one of the principal foundations of Jordan's economy. Despite the unrest and economic difficulties in the Arab world resulting from the Arab Spring uprisings, Jordan's banking sector maintained its growth in 2014. The sector consists of 25 banks, 15 of which are listed on the Amman Stock Exchange. Amman is the base city for the international Arab Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East, serving clients in more than 600 branches in 30 countries on five continents. Arab Bank represents 28% of the Amman Stock Exchange and is the highest-ranked institution by market capitalization on the exchange.\n\nTourism\nAmman is the fourth most-visited Arab city and the ninth highest recipient of international visitor spending. Roughly 1.8 million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3 billion in the city. The expansion of Queen Alia International Airport is an example of the Greater Amman Municipality's heavy investment in the city's infrastructure. The recent construction of a public transportation system and a national railway, and the expansion of roads, are intended to ease the traffic generated by the millions of annual visitors to the city.\nAmman, and Jordan in general, is the Middle East's hub for medical tourism. Jordan receives the most medical tourists in the region and the fifth highest in the world. Amman receives 250,000 foreign patients a year and over $1 billion annually.\n\nBusiness\nAmman is introducing itself as a business hub. The city's skyline is being continuously transformed through the emergence of new projects. A significant portion of business flowed into Amman following the 2003 Iraq War. Jordan's main airport, Queen Alia International Airport, is located south of Amman and is the hub for the country's national carrier Royal Jordanian, a major airline in the region. The airline is headquartered in Zahran district. Rubicon Group Holding and Maktoob, two major regional information technology companies, are based in Amman, along with major international corporations such as Hikma Pharmaceuticals, one of the Middle East's largest pharmaceutical companies, and Aramex, the Middle East's largest logistics and transportation company.\nIn a report by Dunia Frontier Consultants, Amman, along with Doha, Qatar and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, are the favored hubs for multinational corporations operating in the Middle East and North Africa region. In FDI magazine, Amman was chosen as the Middle Eastern city with the most potential to be a leader in foreign direct investment in the region. Furthermore, several of the world's largest investment banks have offices in Amman including Standard Chartered, Société Générale, and Citibank.\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Amman reached 4,007,526 in 2015; the city contains about 42% of Jordan's entire population. It has a land area of 1,680 km2 (648.7 sq mi) which yields a population density of about 2,380 inhabitants per square kilometer (6,200/sq mi). The population of Amman has risen exponentially with the successive waves of immigrants and refugees arriving throughout the 20th century. From a population of roughly 1,000 in 1890, Amman grew to around 1,000,000 inhabitants in 1990, primarily as a result of immigration, but also due to the high birthrate in the city. Amman had been abandoned for centuries until hundreds of Circassians settled it in the 19th century. Today, about 40,000 Circassians live in Amman and its vicinity. After Amman became a major hub along the Hejaz Railway in 1914, many Muslim and Christian merchant families from al-Salt immigrated to the city. A large proportion of Amman's inhabitants have Palestinian roots (urban or rural origin), and the two main demographic groups in the city today are Arabs of Palestinian or Jordanian descent. Other ethnic groups comprise about 2% of the population. There are no official statistics about the proportion of people of Palestinian or Jordanian descent.\nNew arrivals consisting of Jordanians from the north and south of the country and immigrants from Palestine had increased the city's population from 30,000 in 1930 to 60,000 in 1947. About 10,000 Palestinians, mostly from Safed, Haifa and Acre, migrated to the city for economic opportunities before the 1948 war. Many of the immigrants from al-Salt from that time were originally from Nablus. The 1948 war caused an exodus of urban Muslim and Christian Palestinian refugees, mostly from Jaffa, Ramla and Lydda, to Amman, whose population swelled to 110,000. With Jordan's capture of the West Bank during the war, many Palestinians from that area steadily migrated to Amman between 1950 and 1966, before another mass wave of Palestinian refugees from the West Bank moved to the city during the 1967 War. By 1970, the population had swelled to an estimated 550,000. A further 200,000 Palestinians arrived after their expulsion from Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War. Several large Palestinian refugee camps exist around the center of Amman.\nBecause Amman lacks a deep-rooted native population, the city does not have a distinct Arabic dialect, although recently such a dialect utilizing the various Jordanian and Palestinian dialects, has been forming. The children of immigrants in the city are also increasingly referring to themselves as \"Ammani\", unlike much of the first-generation inhabitants who identify more with their respective places of origin.\n\nReligion\nAmman has a mostly Sunni Muslim population, and the city contains numerous mosques. Among the main mosques is the large King Abdullah I Mosque, built between 1982 and 1989. It is capped by a blue mosaic dome beneath which 3,000 Muslims may offer prayer. The Abu Darweesh Mosque, noted for its checkered black-and-white pattern, has an architectural style that is unique to Jordan. The mosque is situated on Jabal Ashrafieh, the highest point in the city. The mosque's interior is marked by light-colored walls and Persian carpets. During the 2004 Amman Message conference, edicts from various clergy-members afforded the following schools of thought as garnering collective recognition: Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi'i, Ja'fari, Zahiri, Zaydi, Ibadi, tassawuf-related Sufism, Muwahhidism and Salafism. Amman also has a small Druze community.\nLarge numbers of Christians from throughout Jordan, particularly from al-Salt, have moved to Amman. Nearby Fuheis is a predominantly Christian town located to the northwest of the city. A small Armenian Catholic community of around 70 families is present in the city. Ecclesiastical courts for matters of personal status are also located in Amman. A total of 16 historic churches are located in Umm ar-Rasas ruins in Al-Jeezah district; the site is believed to have initially served as Roman fortified military camps which gradually became a town around the 5th century AD. It has not been completely excavated. It was influenced by several civilizations including the Romans, Byzantines and Muslims. The site contains some well-preserved mosaic floors, particularly the mosaic floor of the Church of Saint Stephen.\n\nCityscape\nDowntown Amman, the city center area (known in Arabic as Al-Balad), has been dwarfed by the sprawling urban area that surrounds it. Despite the changes, much remains of its old character. Jabal Amman is a tourist attraction in old Amman, where the city's largest souks, museums, ancient constructions, monuments, and cultural sites are found. Jabal Amman also contains the famous Rainbow Street and the cultural Souk Jara market.\n\nArchitecture\nResidential buildings are limited to four stories above street level and if possible another four stories below, according to the Greater Amman Municipality regulations. The buildings are covered with thick white or beige limestone or sandstone. The buildings usually have balconies on each floor, with the exception of the ground floor, which has a front and back yard. Some buildings make use of Mangalore tiles on the roofs or on the roof of covered porches. Hotels, towers and commercial buildings are either covered by stone, plastic or glass.\n\nHigh-rise construction and towers\nZahran district in west Amman is the location of the Jordan Gate, which is a high class commercial and residential project currently under construction in the Wadi Al-Seer district of Amman, Jordan, it consists of two high-rise buildings connected by a multi-storey podium.\nNew Abdali district hosts a mall, a boulevard along with several hotels, commercial and residential towers. Valued at more than US$5 billion with two main phases, the district created a new visible center for Amman and act as the major business district for the city.\nThe first phase, estimated at more than JD2.4 billion, and receiving about 20 million visitors annually, contains seven Itowers extending over an area of 1.03 million square metres. It attracts about 500 companies operating in 27 sectors, and provided a total of 15,000 job opportunities by 2023.\nA second phase was announced in May 2024, which will cover an area of 1.2 million square meters and is anticipated to create over 3,000 job opportunities each year, were outlined in the statement. This phase involves the construction of a multi-use conference center with a capacity for 25,000 people, as well as two towers that will include hotels, residential apartments, commercial centers, and advanced medical facilities.\n\nCulture\nMuseums\nThe largest museum in Jordan is The Jordan Museum. It contains much of the valuable archeological findings in the country, including some of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Neolithic limestone statues of 'Ain Ghazal, and a copy of the Mesha Stele. Other museums include the Duke's Diwan, Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts, Jordan Archaeological Museum, The Children's Museum Jordan, The Martyrs' Memorial and Museum, the Royal Automobile Museum, the Prophet Mohammad Museum, the Museum of Parliamentary Life, the Jordan Folklore Museum, and museums at the University of Jordan.\n\nLifestyle\nAmman is considered one of the most liberal cities in the Arab world. The city has become one of the most popular destinations for expatriates and college students who seek to live, study, or work in the Middle East or the Arab world in general. The city's culinary scene has changed from its shawarma stands and falafel joints to embrace many popular international restaurants and fast-food outlets such as Asian fusion restaurants, French bistros and Italian trattorias. The city has become famous for its fine dining scene among Western expatriates and Persian Gulf tourists.\n\nLarge shopping malls were built during the 2000s in Amman, including the Mecca Mall, Abdoun Mall, City Mall, Al-Baraka Mall, TAJ Lifestyle Center, Zara Shopping Center, Avenue Mall, and Abdali Mall in Al Abdali. Wakalat Street (\"Agencies Street\") is Amman's first pedestrian-only street and carries a lot of name-label clothes. The Sweifieh area is considered to be the main shopping district of Amman.\nNightclubs, music bars and shisha lounges are present across Amman, changing the city's old image as the conservative capital of the kingdom. This burgeoning new nightlife scene is shaped by Jordan's young population. In addition to the wide range of drinking and dancing venues on the social circuit of the city's affluent crowd, Amman hosts cultural entertainment events, including the annual Amman Summer Festival. Souk Jara is a Jordanian weekly flea market event that occurs every Friday throughout the summer. Sweifieh is considered to be the unofficial red-light district of Amman as it holds most of the city's nightclubs, bars. Jabal Amman and Jabal al-Luweibdeh are home to many pubs and bars as well, making the area popular among bar hoppers.\nAlcohol is widely available in restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and supermarkets. There are numerous nightclubs and bars across the city, especially in West Amman. As of 2011, there were 77 registered nightclubs in Jordan (excluding bars and pubs), overwhelmingly located in the capital city. In 2009, there were 222 registered liquor stores in Amman.\n\nCuisine\nDanielle Pergament of The New York Times described Ammani cuisine as a product of several cuisines in the region, writing that it combines \"the bright vegetables from Lebanon, crunchy falafels from Syria, juicy kebabs from Egypt and, most recently, spicy meat dishes from Jordan's neighbor, Iraq. It's known as the food of the Levant – an ancient word for the area bounded by the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian peninsula. But the food here isn't just the sum of its calories. In this politically, religiously and ethnically fraught corner of the world, it is a symbol of bloodlines and identity.\" However, the city's street food scene makes the Ammani cuisine distinctive.\n\nSports\nAmman-based football clubs Al-Wehdat and Al-Faisaly, both former league champions, share one of the most popular rivalries in the local football scene. Amman hosted the 2016 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup along with Irbid and Zarqa.\nThe 2007 Asian Athletics Championships and more than one edition of the IAAF World Cross Country Championships were held in the city. Amman also hosts the Jordan Rally, which form part of the FIA World Rally Championship, becoming one of the largest sporting events ever held in Jordan.\nAmman is home to a growing number of foreign sports such as skateboarding and rugby; the latter has two teams based in the city: Amman Citadel Rugby Club and Nomads Rugby Club. In 2014, German non-profit organization Make Life Skate Life completed construction of the 7Hills Skatepark, a 650 square meter concrete skatepark located at Samir Rifai park in Downtown Amman.\n\nMedia and music\nThe majority of Jordan's radio stations are based in Amman. The first radio station to originate in the city was Hunna Amman in 1959; it mainly broadcast traditional Bedouin music. In 2000, Amman Net became the first de facto private radio station to be established in the country, despite private ownership of radio stations being illegal at the time. After private ownership was legalized in 2002, several more radio stations were created.\n\nMost Jordanian newspapers and news stations are situated in Amman. Daily newspapers published in Amman include Alghad, Ad-Dustour, The Jordan Times, and Al Ra'i, the most circulated newspaper in the country. In 2011, Al Ra'i was ranked the 5th most popular newspaper in the Arab world by Forbes Middle-East report. Al-Arab Al-Yawm is the only daily pan-Arab newspaper in Jordan. The two most popular Jordanian TV channels, Ro'ya TV and JRTV, are based in Amman.\nAside from mainstream Arabic pop, there is a growing independent music scene in the city which includes many bands that have sizable audiences across the Arab world. Local Ammani bands along with other bands in the Middle East gather in the Roman Theater during the Al-Balad Music Festival held annually in August. Music genres of the local bands are diverse, ranging from heavy metal to Arabic Rock, jazz and rap. Performers include JadaL, Torabyeh, Bilocate, Akher Zapheer, Autostrad and El Morabba3.\n\nEvents\nMany events take place in Amman, including Red Bull-sponsored events Soundclash and Soapbox race, the second part of Jerash Festival, Al-Balad Music Festival, Amman Marathon, Made in Jordan Festival, Amman Book Festival and New Think Festival. Venues for such cultural events often include the Roman and Odeon Theaters downtown, the Ras al Ain Hanger, King Hussein Business Park, Rainbow Theater and Shams Theater, the Royal Film Commission, Shoman libraries and Darat al Funun, and the Royal Cultural Center at Sports City. In addition to large-scale events and institutional planning, scholars point to tactical urbanism as a key element of the city's cultural fabric.\n\nTransportation\nAirports\nThe main airport serving Amman is Queen Alia International Airport, situated about 30 km (18.64 mi) south of Amman. Much smaller is Amman Civil Airport, a one-terminal airport that serves primarily domestic and nearby international routes and the army. Queen Alia International Airport is the major international airport in Jordan and the hub for Royal Jordanian, the flag carrier. Its expansion was recently done and modified, including the decommissioning of the old terminals and the commissioning of new terminals costing $700M, to handle over 16 million passengers annually. It is now considered a state-of-the-art airport and was named 'the best airport in the Middle East' for 2014 and 2015 and 'the best improvement in the Middle East' for 2014 by Airport Service Quality Survey, the world's leading airport passenger satisfaction benchmark program.\n\nRoads\nAmman has an extensive road network. Eight roundabout \"circles\", which formerly marked neighborhoods, are used as landmarks. The road network includes many bridges and tunnels due to the mountainous nature of the terrain. A leading example is the Abdoun Bridge, which spans Wadi Abdoun and connects the 4th Circle to Abdoun Circle. It is considered one of Amman's many landmarks and is the first curved suspended bridge to be built in the country.\n\nSuccessive waves of refugees to the city has led to the rapid construction of new neighborhoods, but Amman's capacity for new or widened roads remains limited despite the influx. This has resulted in increasing traffic jams, particularly during summer when there are large numbers of tourists and Jordanian expatriates visiting. In 2015, a ring road encompassing the city was constructed, which aims to connect the northern and southern parts of the city in order for traffic to be diverted outside Amman and to improve the environmental conditions in the city.\n\nBus and taxi\nThe city has frequent bus connections to other cities in Jordan, as well as to major cities in neighboring countries; the latter are also served by service taxis. Internal transport is served by a number of bus routes and taxis. Service taxis, which most often operate on fixed routes, are readily available and inexpensive. The two main bus and taxi stations are Abdali (near the King Abdullah Mosque, the Parliament and Palace of Justice) and the Raghadan Central Bus Station near the Roman theater in the city center. Popular Jordanian bus company services include JETT and Al-Mahatta. Taxis are the most common way to get around in Amman due their high availability and inexpensiveness.\nThe Amman Bus and the Amman Bus Rapid Transit public transportation systems currently serve the city. Construction work on the BRT system started in 2010, but was halted soon after amid feasibility concerns. Resuming in 2015, the first route of the BRT system was inaugurated in 2021, and the second in 2022. Another BRT route connecting Amman with Zarqa started operations in May 2024.\nThe BRT system in Amman runs on 2 routes: the first from Sweileh in northwest Amman to the Ras Al-Ain area next to downtown Amman, and the second from Sweileh to Mahatta terminal in eastern Amman. Both routes meet at the Sports City intersection. The first route is currently served by three lines: 98, 99 and 100. Ticket price for all lines of Amman Bus and Amman BRT are bought either online via the Amman Bus mobile application or as a rechargeable card in major terminals. Passengers scan their cards or QR codes on phone when boarding the bus, where the price ticket is subtracted from the available balance. The buses are air-conditioned, accessible, monitored with security cameras and have free internet service.\n\nEducation\nAmman is a major regional center of education. The Amman region hosts Jordan's highest concentration of education centers. There are 20 universities in Amman. The University of Jordan is the largest public university in the city. There are 448 private schools in the city attended by 90,000 students, including Jubilee School, Amman Baccalaureate School, Amman Academy, Amman National School, Modern American School, American Community School in Amman, and National Orthodox School.\nUniversities include:\n\nUniversity of Jordan\nAl-Ahliyya Amman University\nAl-Isra University\nAl-Zaytoonah University of Jordan\nAmman Arab University\nApplied Science University\nArab Academy for Banking and Financial Sciences\nArab Open University\nColumbia University: Amman Branch\nGerman-Jordanian University: Amman Branch\nJordan Academy for Maritime Studies\nJordan Academy of Music\nJordan Institute of Banking Studies\nJordan Media Institute\nMiddle East University\nUniversity of Petra\nPhiladelphia University\nPrincess Sumaya University for Technology\nQueen Noor Civil Aviation Technical College\nWorld Islamic Sciences and Education University\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nAmman is twinned with:\n\nGallery\nSee also\nEarly Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East\nRabbath Ammon\nPhiladelphia\nDowntown Amman\nAmman Citadel\nSeil Amman\nList of tallest buildings in Amman\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nAmman Digital Community Facebook page\nGreater Amman Municipality Facebook page\nAmman public transportation map\nPhotos of Amman from the American Center of Research",
          "summary": "Amman is the capital and the largest city of Jordan, and the country's economic, political, and cultural center. With a population of five million as of 2024, Amman is Jordan's primate city and is the largest city in the Levant region, the fifth-largest city in the Arab world, and the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East.\nAmman is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman dates to the 8th millennium BC in 'Ain Ghazal, home to the world's oldest statues of the human form. During the Iron Age, the city was known as Rabat Aman, the capital of the Ammonite Kingdom. In the 3rd century BC, the city was renamed Philadelphia and became one of the ten Greco-Roman cities of the Decapolis. Later, in the 7th century AD, the Rashidun Caliphate renamed the city Amman. Throughout most of the Islamic era, the city alternated between periods of devastation and periods of relative prosperity. Amman was largely abandoned during the Ottoman period from the 15th century until 1878, when it was resettled by Circassians. The city grew after it was connected to the Hejaz Railway in 1904, leading to the formation of its first municipal council in 1909.\nAmman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as Transjordan's capital in 1921, receiving migrations from different Jordanian and Levantine cities, and later several successive waves of refugees: Palestinians in 1948 and 1967; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003; and Syrians since 2011. It was initially built on seven hills, but now spans over 19 hills combining 22 areas, which are administered by the Greater Amman Municipality. Areas of Amman have gained their names from either the hills (jabal) or the valleys (wadi) they occupy, such as Jabal al-Luweibdeh and Wadi Abdoun. East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities, while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city.\nApproximately one million visitors arrived in Amman in 2018, which made it the 89th most-visited city in the world and the 12th most-visited Arab city. Amman has a relatively fast growing economy and it is ranked as a Beta− global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Moreover, it was named one of the Middle East and North Africa's best cities according to economic, labor, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. The city is among the most popular locations in the Arab world for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices, alongside Doha and only behind Dubai. Amman has a bus network, including a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system that serves the city and connects it to neighboring Zarqa.",

          "content": "عَمَّان هي عاصمة المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية ومركز محافظة العاصمة. تُعد أكبر مدن المملكة وواحدة من أكبر المدن العربية بالنسبة لعدد السكان، إذ بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2023 حوالي 4.8 مليون نسمة، مما يجعلها أيضًا واحدة من أسرع المدن نموًا بالسكان بالعالم. تقع المدينة في وسط المملكة على دائرة عرض 31 شمالاً وخط طول 35 شرقًا في منطقة تكثر فيها الجبال، فنشأت في الوديان بين الجبال أولاً فضاقت على سكانها، فارتقوا سفوحها واستمروا في الاتساع عبر قممها حتى انتشرت المدينة بأطرافها فوق 20 جبلا.\nتُعتبر عمّان المركز التجاري والإداري للأردن وقلبه الاقتصادي والتعليمي، حيث أصبحت عمّان نقطة استقطاب للكثير من الجاليات العربية لموقعها المتميز ولعمارتها المعاصرة، كما تستقطب عمّان الكثير من السياح سنويًا من أوروبا الغربية وأمريكا الشمالية واليابان وإستراليا ومن الدول العربية المجاورة والقريبة، وكثيرًا من عائلات دول الخليج العربي تحديدًا، إذ تكثر بها المعالم السياحية عمومًا والعلاجية الطبية خصوصاً. كان من نتيجة وقوع عمّان في مثل هذا الموقع الاستراتيجي في بلاد الشام والشرق الأوسط، أن أصبح موقعها يتحكم بالاقتصاد الوطني ويُحرّك 90% من الاستثمار على المستوى الوطني.\nيرجع تاريخ مدينة عمّان إلى الألف السابع قبل الميلاد، وبهذا تُعتبر من ضمن أقدم مدن العالم المأهولة بالسكان إلى يومنا هذا. وعمّان مدينة قديمة أقيمت على أنقاض مدينة عرفت باسم «ربّة عمّون» ثم «فيلادلفيا» ثم «عمّان» اشتقاقاً من «ربة عمّون»، واتخذها العمّونيون عاصمة لهم. وقد أُنشئت المدينة على تلال سبعة، وكانت مركزًا للمنطقة على ما يبدو في ذلك الوقت، وهي إحدى عواصم بلاد الشام الأربع، وهي أيضًا إحدى المدن الشامية القديمة التي أصبحت عاصمةً لإمارة شرق الأردن ومن ثم المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية بعد استقلالها في العام 1946 عن بريطانيا.\nيسكن عمّان الحديثة مجموعة متنوعة من السكان من أصول مختلفة أتوا من مختلف المناطق، منهم من أتى من مدن أردنية قريبة، ومنهم من أتى من فلسطين، ومنهم من القوقاز وسوريا والعراق.\nشهدت أمانة عمان الكبرى مؤخرًا تطورًا كبيرًا، حيث توسعت عمان بشكل لم تشهده المدينة من قبل. ونالت خطة مدينة عمّان الشمولية جوائز عالمية منها جائزة القيادة العالمية في تخطيط المدن وجائزة المدينة عن قارة آسيا لعام 2007. يبلغ عدد المناطق الإدارية في أمانة عمان 22 منطقة مُوزعة جغرافيا تحوي كل منطقة طاقمًا متكاملا من الموظفين، أما من الناحية الإدارية فهناك مجلس أمانة عمان الكبرى الذي يضم 68 عضوا برئاسة أمين العاصمة، والمجلس مقسم بدوره إلى 14 لجنة مختلفة.\nيُشار بالذكر إلى أنه تم اعتماد يوم 2 آذار/ مارس من كل عام يومًا لمدينة عمّان بعد إقرار مجلس الوزراء الأردني قرارًا بذلك في بداية عام 2021، وذلك في إطار الاحتفاء بمرور 100 عام على تأسيس الدولة الأردنيّة.\n\nالتسمية والتاريخ\nالعصور القديمة\nيعود تاريخ عمّان إلى أكثر من 7000 سنة قبل الميلاد. وقد مرّت عليها حضارات عديدة دلّت عليها الآثار المنتشرة في أرجاء المدينة. وخلال هذه الفترة الطويلة، شهدت المدينة الكثير من الحضارات، كان أهمها العمونيون. يُعد المدرج الروماني أحد أكبر الآثار المتبقية في المدينة. كما يدل جبل القلعة بآثاره المختلفة يدل على الحضارات العمونية والإغريقية والرومانية والبيزنطية والأموية، بالإضافة إلى رجم الملفوف الواقع في جبل عمان والمطل على وادي صقرة وهو ما تبقى من حضارات فترة ما قبل التاريخ لعبّاد الطبيعة وعناصرها كالشمس والقمر والنجوم.\n\nيعود أول تواجد بشري في مدينة عمّان في آثار عين غزال شرق العاصمة إلى 9 آلاف عام من الآن. لقد كشفت التنقيبات على أن هذه المنطقة هي من أغنى مواقع العصر الحجري الحديث ما قبل الفخاري، كما أن القرية قد سُكنت دون انقطاع. كانت عين غزال مستوطنة زراعية ورعوية بُنيت من الحجارة غير المشذبة، وكانت المباني مستطيلة الشكل وبجدران مستقيمة، وقد رُصفت الأرضيات ثم قصرت بالجبس المدكوك حد اللمعان، وبعد ذلك تم طلائه باللون الأحمر. إن أهم ما يميز موقع عين غزال التماثيل البشرية المُكتشفة، والتي تم العثور عليها في المنطقة الوسطى للموقع على مجموعتين من التماثيل البشرية، والتي تُعد من التماثيل النادرة في العالم.\nلقد قدم إلى عمّان الحيثيون والهكسوس، ثم قبائل العماليق الأقدمين، تلتهم قبائل بني عمون، أو العمونيين، الذين أعطوا المدينة اسمهم فأطلقوا عليها في البداية اسم ربة عمّون، والربة تعني العاصمة أو دار الملك ثم سقطت مع مرور الزمن كلمة ربة وبقيت عمون حتى أطلق عليها الأمويون اسم عمّان. اتخذه العمونيون جبل القلعة مقرًا لحكمهم في المدينة، وهو مشرف على وسط عمّان حاليًا.\nقام الآشورويون بالتمدد غربًا نحو منطقة العمونيين، حيث لم يستطيعوا الوقوف بوجههم في بداية الأمر، وانضم العمونييون إلى حلف آرامي لمقاومة النفوذ الآشوري في بداية القرن التاسع قبل الميلاد، ولكن الآشوريين استطاعوا احتلال مملكة العمونيين، وقرر الملك الآشوري سنحاريب منح عمون الاستقلال الذاتي. كان للسيطرة الآشورية أثر في استتباب الأمن، مما مكّن العمونييون من السيطرة على جزء ٍ كبيرٍ من طرق القوافل التجارية. قاوم العمونيون البابليين - الذين استمروا في هجومهم على الأجزاء الجنوبية من الإمبراطورية الآشوريّة، ما أثّر سلبيًا على الوضع الاقتصادي. وفي عهد الملك نبوخذ نصر، استطاع البابليّون السيطرة عليها.\n\nورث البابليون أملاك الآشوريين في آسيا في عام 612 ق. م. وقد قام ملك مصر بغزو بلاد الشام في عام 590 ق. م، وهي فلسطين وشرقي الأردن. ثم قام نبوخذ نصر ملك البابليين آنذاك في عام 586 ق. م بسبي أهالي القدس وأعاد البلاد إلى سلطانه.\nفي عام 539 ق.م استطاع قورش الفارسي القضاء على الإمبراطورية البابلية وإقامة الإمبراطورية الفارسية، ثم استولى الفرس على فلسطين والأردن، ودخلوا عمّان، وأصبحت في تلك الفترة تحت حكم الإمبراطورية الفارسية. ولقد منح الفرس عمّان حكمًا ذاتيًا في الفترة ما بين 540 ـ 332 ق. م، إلا أن الإغريق قَضوا على دولة الفرس عام 332 ق.م، وبدأت فترة الإمبراطورية اليونانية.\nسيطر الإغريق البطالسة على المنطقة بما فيها ربة عمون، التي أبدل اسمها بطليموس الثاني عام 285 ق.م إلى اسم «فيلادلفيا»- ويعني مدينة الحب الأخوي؛\nنسبة للقائد «فيلادلفيوس» وجعل من جبل القلعة موقعا للمعابد كجبل الأكروبولس في أثينا. انتعشت في هذا العهد منطقة عراق الأمير، نسبة لقصر الملك طوبيا المعروف بعراق الأمير، أو قصر العبد.\nانقسمت عمان لتصبح جزءاً من الدولتين النبطية والسلوقية إلى أن استولى عليها الملك الروماني «هيرودس» في العام 30 ق.م. وبهذا تدخل المدينة العهد الروماني ومن ثم البيزنطي حتى منصف القرن السابع.\nالعصر الروماني والبيزنطي\n\nامتد العهد الروماني ثم البيزنطي من 63 - 636. وأصبحت المدينة جزءًا من حلف الديكابولس، وهو تحالف كان يضم عشرة مدن تقع اليوم في الأردن وسوريا وفلسطين. لقد أُعيد بناء فيلادلفيا أيام الحكم الروماني لتشمل مدرج وشوارع مرصوفة وأعمدة على الطراز الروماني. أيام الحكم البيزنطي كانت مقر الكرسي المسيحي وبُنيَت الكثير من الكنائس ولكن المدينة لم تعد مزدهرة كما كانت. وقد وصلها الفرس في عام 614م وأعادوا احتلالها، لكن حكمهم كان قصيرا وانتهى قبيل وصول جيوش المسلمين اليها بعد عدة سنوات.\nيوجد في المدينة آثار رومانية ما زالت قائمة ليومنا هذا، أهمها ساحة الفورم والمدرج الروماني. يقع الفورم بين جبل القلعة وجبل الجوفة أمام المدرج الروماني بوسط عمان. تبلغ مساحة الفورم والمسرح ما مجموعه 7600 متر مربع ويعود تاريخ بنائهما على الأرجح إلى القرن الثاني الميلادي وتحديدًا بين عامي 138م و 161م إبان عهد القيصر أنطونيوس بيوس. اليوم بني إلى جانب الفورم حديقة ذات نوافير عدة، تستعمل كمأوى للهروب من أزمة المرور وزحمة التسوق في وسط مدينة عمان. كانت الساحة محاطة من ثلاث جهات بشوراع أعمدة، التي يشاهد المرء منها اليوم فقط الأعمدة الواقعة في الجزء الجنوبي من الساحة، المتاخمة للمدرج. بنى الرومان، نظام تصريف للمياه تحت الساحة.\nأما البيزنطيون فيتركون كنائس عدة، حيث كشفت حفريات دائرة الآثار العامة في عمّان، عن كنائس تعود إلى فترة القرن الرابع الميلادي وحتى الثامن، أثناء حكم البيزنطيين للمنطقة في ضواحي المدينة في كل من: الصويفية، خلدا، الرابية، الجبيهة، ياجوز، البصة، القويسمة، رجم الكرسي، اللويبدة في دارة الفنون، حسبان التي تبعد عن عمان 20 كيلو مترا، والجبل الأخضر.\n\nالعصر الإسلامي\nبدأ هذا العصر بعد الفتح الإسلامي للشام في 635، واستطاع جيش يزيد بن أبي سفيان أن يفتح عمّان، وتنتهي بذلك دولة الغساسنة التابعة للبيزنطيين، والمتحكمة بمنطقة البلقاء التي كانت عمان جزءا منها، وعادت المدينة لتُعرف باسمها السامي القديم ثانية: عمّان أو عمّون.\n\nفي العصر الأموي، بنى الأمويون قصرًا كبيرًا على جبل القلعة، وغدت عمّان مركزًا إداريًا، يقيم فيها الأمير، وتضرب فيها النقود، وتقوم حاميتها بمراقبة طريق القوافل التجارية، وحراسة طريق الحج، وبرك الماء كبركة زيزاء والقسطل. وعندما آلت الأمور إلى الدولة العباسية، جرت على أرض كورة عمان (مركز اداري) معارك دُمّرت فيها الأسوار والحصون في مواجهة عسكرية داخلية. ويشير المؤرخون إلى أن العباسيين تحصنوا في عمّان عندما ثار بعض الأمويين مطالبين بالخلافة في عهد الخليفة المأمون بن الرشيد.\n\nكانت عمّان في عهد الفاطميين مركزًا لتجميع القوات، ولكن في أواخر حكمهم في القرن الحادي عشر الميلادي بدأت الضغوط الخارجية بقدوم الصليبيين. وفي سنة 1184 مر صلاح الدين الأيوبي بعمّان في طريقه إلى الكرك، وأصبحت في تلك الفترة جزءًا من دولة الايوبيين. أمّا في عهد المماليك، فقد شهدت عمان إستقرارًا، وازدهرت أسواقها في مواسم الحج. لقد حظيت عمّان باهتمام الظاهر بيبرس ورعايته عندما اعتلى عرش دولة المماليك في مصر والشام. وفي عهد السلطان قلاوون عام 1279، انتقلت الولاية من السلط إلى عمّان، وفي عام 1355 بنى المماليك مدرسة في عمان لتدريس المذهب الحنفي.\nفي عام 1516 توالى على حكم الإمبراطورية العثمانية عدد من السلاطين، واستطاع الأتراك العثمانيون دخول عمّان، إلا أنها بعد ذلك دخلت دفتر النسيان والإهمال حتى نهاية القرن التاسع عشر، نتيجة لعدة زلازل ضربتها وانتشار الأوبئة مثل الطاعون، حيث بدأت منذ 1878، تشهد تزايدًا في أعداد السكان، إذ قامت السلطات العثمانية بالسماح لعدد من العائلات الشركسية (المهاجرة من اضطهاد القيصر الروسي) بالسكن في عمّان. وتجدر الإشارة إلى أن متحف الآثار الأردني به نماذج من أثار هذه الحضارات كلها عبر عصورها المتتالية.\nقال عنها المقدسي في كتابه: «أحسن التقاسيم في معرفة الأقاليم»، أن مدينة عمّان هي واحدة من ضمن ثلاث مدن تشبه مكة، حيث يقول: «رأيت لها ثلاث نظائر: عمّان بالشام، وإصطخر بفارس، وقرية الحمراء بخراسان». وقد جاء ذكر عمّان في كتب أدب الرحلات العربية، فقد أورد عنها في كتاب معجم البلدان لياقوت الحموي ثلاث أبيات شعر قال فيها الأحوص بن محمد الأنصاري:\n\nعمّان الحديثة\nتأسست عمّان الحديثة في نهاية القرن التاسع عشر مع وصول طلائع المهاجرين الشركس من قبائل الشابسوغ ليستقروا قرب سيل عمان والمدرج الروماني عام 1878، نتيجة تهجيرهم القسري بالقوة المسلحة من قبل القوات الروسية القيصرية التي استطاعت إكمال احتلال وطنهم الأم شمال القوقاز عام 1864 بعد قتال شركسي ضد هذه القوات التي كانت تعتبر من أقوى الجيوش الأوروبية طيلة ما يزيد عن مئة عام. ثم عملت على تفريغ وطنهم القومي التاريخي بتهجيرهم إلى الدولة العثمانية المجاورة، لإحلال مستوطنين من الشعوب الموالية للروس كالقوزاق والجورجيين والأوكرانيين الروس أنفسهم. كانت شرق الأردن إحدى المناطق العثمانية في ذلك الوقت والتي أنزلت فيها الدولة العثمانية الشراكسة المهجّرين، وكانت عمّان المدينة الأثرية أولى مناطق الأردن التي نزل فيها الشراكسة منذ عام 1878. كان هؤلاء المهاجرون الشراكسة من الفلاحين الذين عملوا على زراعة الأرض وتربية الماشية وبناء بيوتهم ومساجدهم، حيث وزعت عليهم السلطات العثمانية الأراضي الصالحة للزراعة، مما أنعش القرية وأعاد إليها الحياة. بعد ذلك أصبحت عمان عامل جذب لقدوم المزيد من السكان إليها من مختلف الجهات. وكانت عمّان ضمن المناطق التي سُكنت لوجود المياه فيها بوفرة، وفي عام 1933، بلغ عدد الشركس فيها 1,700 نسمة.\nلقد توالت على عمان مجموعات أخرى من المهاجرين الشراكسة القادمين من شمال القوقاز بعد احتلال بلادهم من قبل الجيوش الروسية القيصرية عام 1864، فسكنوا في أحياء ما زالت تحمل أسماءها حتى اليوم مثل حي المهاجرين وحي الشابسوغ وحي القبرطاي ومحلّة الأبزاخ. تتابع قدوم الناس إلى عمّان والاستقرار فيها عبر السنين التالية، فقدمت جماعات من الأرمن والأكراد والشيشان والشوام والمقدسيين والحجازيين وغيرهم مما أضفى على المجتمع الأردني تنوعا عرقياً شكل جزءا هاما من نسيجه.\nلقد عزمت الدولة العثمانية في نهاية القرن التاسع على إنشاء ولاية في المنطقة يكون مركزها عمان. وقد جاء في مشروع الولاية المقترح: «فالبلد السوري، يتكون حالياً من ولاية دمشق، وولاية بيروت، ومتصرفية القدس الشريف. غير أن هذه المنطقة شاسعة، تكاد تبلغ مساحتها نصف مساحة الأناضول. وهي مناطق عامرة، فيمكن تشكيل ولاية فيها، على أن تكون عاصمتها عمان، وأن يطلق على الولاية اسم ولاية عمّان أو معمورة الحميدية، ويُتخذ في معان والشوبك وحسبان والسلط وعين الزرقاء وباقي الأماكن قائم مقاميات». وكان السبب في اقتراح فكرة الولاية الحميدية أن تشكيل ولاية عمّان سيعمل على ضمان الأمن على الطريق التي تخترقها ابتداء من دمشق حتى المدينة المنورة. إذ ترافق ذلك مع تفكير الدولة العثمانية بإنشاء سكة حديد، تبدأ من دمشق وتصل إلى اليمن، على طول الساحل الشرقي للبحر الأحمر. غير أن كمال باشا، صاحب فكرة المشروع المقترح، أبدى تخوفه من أن تتعرض هذه الطريق لهجوم قوى أجنبية، كالإنجليز، الذين يحاولون احتلال مصر، مما يعرقل حركة القوات العثمانية الذاهبة إلى الحجاز واليمن.\nعلى الرغم من أن مشروع الولاية الجديدة ظل فكرة، ولم يُطبّق، إلا أنه بقي حاضرًا في أذهان السياسيين والعسكريين العثمانيين أثناء إدارتهم لهواجس ومخاطر الأمن الداخلي والخارجي. فقاموا بدءًا من العام 1878، بتشجيع استقرار الشركس والشيشان، على طول خط استراتيجي، يمتد من منبج وحمص والجولان فعمّان، حيث كانت الاضطرابات والعصيان على الدولة أمرًا مألوفًا. ولم يدرك الشركس أبعاد هذا الدور، ووجدوا أنفسهم حين وصلوا إلى البلقاء في العراء. وواجهوا المصاعب بالصبر والجهد والتحدي، معتمدين على أنفسهم. وقد بدؤوا باستصلاح الأراضي وزارعتها، وشرعوا ببناء قرى جديدة هنا وهناك، فكانت عمّان وناعور ووادي السير وصويلح وغيرها. جاء الشركس في بداية وصولهم إلى عمّان، قادمين من نابلس ومنطقة خربة الشركس التابعة للواء عكا. وكان أغلب الفوج الأول من المهاجرين الشركس، في العام 1878، يتكون من قبيلة الشابسوغ، حيث سكنوا بين الأبنية الأثرية للمدينة، وفي دهاليز المدرج الروماني والكهوف المحيطة به.\nأسهم الخط الحديدي الحجازي في زيادة ملحوظة بعدد سكان المدينة، لا سيما عندما رُبطت به المدينة عبر محطة عمان التي تبعد عن مركز المدينة خمسة كيلومترات، وذلك عام 1903. لذلك أخذت أوضاع عمّان السكانية والاقتصادية تشهد تطورًا تدريجيًا بطيئًا، فأُنشئ أول مجلس بلدي في المدينة عام 1909، وغدت مركزاً لمديرية الناحية عام 1914، وقد كانت عمان قبل تأسيس الأردن الحديث سنة 1921، مركزًا مهمًا رغم قلة عدد سكانها مقارنة ببعض المدن المجاورة كالسلط ونابلس والقدس، حيث كانت أشبه بقرية كبيرة طيلة تلك الفترة. وقُدّر عدد سكانها بعد انتهاء الحرب العالمية الأولى بما بين 1500 و 2000 نسمة أو أكثر بقليل، معظمهم من الشراكسة المهاجرين، الذين تمركزوا في وسط البلد في أحياء المهاجرين والشابسوغ والقبرطاي ومحلة الأبزاخ والأشرفية وجبل التاج وأجزاء من جبل عمان.\nمئوية أمانة عمّان الكبرى\n\nاحتفلت أمانة عمان الكبرى عام 2009 بالذكرى المئوية لتأسيسها، إذ تأسس أول مجلس بلدي عام 1909 كون مسيرة المائة عام الماضية من عمر عمّان شهدت تطورًا كبيرًا في شتى الميادين، وتدرجت من قرية صغيرة إلى عاصمة حديثة ومن مجلس بلدي إلى أمانة عمان الكبرى، وتخطت العديد من الصعاب والتحديات، فضلا عن تطور مفهوم ومستوى ونوعية الخدمات التي تقدم للعمانيين.\nلقد تعاقب على رئاسة المدينة، خلال مئة عام، منذ تأسيس مجلسها البلدي الأول عام 1909 وحتى العام 2009، ثمانية عشر رئيسا للبلدية (1909-1950)، وأربعة عشر أمينًا للعاصمة (1950-1987)، وتسعة أمناء لعمّان الكبرى (1987-2015).\n\nجغرافيا\nتقع عمّان على عدة جبال، وترتفع عن سطح البحر قرابة 750 مترًا، ومتوسط ارتفاع جبالها السبع الأولى التي أُنشئت عليها 918 متر. تقع مدينة العقبة على بعد 360 كيلومترًا جنوبها، ومدينة إربد على مسافة تقارب من 80 كيلومترًا شمالها. بينما يقع نهر الأردن على مسافة 45 كيلومترًا إلى الغرب منها. أما عن مدن الجوار فتبعد القدس عنها بمسافة 80 كيلومترًا إلى الغرب، ودمشق مسافة 180 كيلومترًا إلى الشمال، وبغداد مسافة 800 كيلومترًا إلى الشرق، أما مكة المكرمة فتقع على مسافة 1225 كيلومترًا إلى الجنوب.\n\nالتضاريس\nتمتد عمّان بشكل رئيسي فوق عشرين جبلاً تقريبًا على طول المدينة وعرضها ومن أهم جبالها السبعة الأوائل وهي جبل القصور، جبل الجوفة، جبل التاج، جبل النزهة، جبل النصر، جبل الأشرفية، جبل النظيف، والجبل الأخضر. بالإضافة إلى جبل عمان وجبل اللويبدة وجبل الحسين وجبل القلعة. معظمها موجود الآن ضمن عمان الشرقية، وتتنوع في المدينة التضاريس كالتالي:\n\nالمنطقة الشمالية، وتتكون من عدة جبال متموّجة نوعًا ما، كما في الجبيهة وشفا بدران وأبو نصير.\nالمنطقة الوسطى، تتميز بأنها ملتقى الأودية مع سيل عمان، وهي أودية شديدة الانحدار تتخللها النتوءات الصخرية البارزة وطبقات صخرية متموّجة على سفوح الجبال التي تمر من خلالها، مثل وادي عبدون ووادي صقرة ووادي الحدادة.\nالمنطقة الغربية، تمتد على جانب غور الأردن، ويتجاوز ارتفاعها 1000 متر كما في تلاع العلي والشميساني وصويلح.\nالمنطقة الشرقية والجنوبية الشرقية، وتتميز بسطحها المتموج، وتعد من الأراضي الصحراوية القاحلة الممتدة إلى الصحراء الأردنية، كما في ماركا الجنوبية والقويسمة.\n\nتنظيم المدينة\nتنقسم عمان إلى جزئين رئيسيين وهما:\n\nعمان الشرقية وهي الجزء الأقدم من المدينة.\nعمان الغربية وهي الجزء الأحدث من المدينة.\nكانت عمان مقتصرة على الشركس في نهايات القرن التاسع عشر وحتى بداية القرن العشرين، ولكن بعد إعلانها عاصمة لإمارة شرق الأردن ومن بعدها المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية ازداد التوسع العمراني ووفِدَ إليها الناس من مختلف المناطق، وبدأت مدينة عمان الحديثة بالتوسع في عقد الخمسينات والستينات من القرن الماضي حيث أخذت أحياء جديدة في الظهور في عمان الغربية.\nفي بداية عام 2007 قررت أمانة عمان الكبرى، ضم أراض قريبة من مطار الملكة علياء الدولي جنوب العاصمة، لتصبح جزءا من مناطق المدينة، مثل الجيزة ومرج الحمام وسحاب، مما ضاعف مساحة عمان لتصبح 1,680 كم². وضمن الخطة للسنوات المقبلة، تتجه الأمانة إلى التوسع العمراني نحو المناطق الشرقية والجنوبية حيث سهولة استغلال الأراضي المنبسطة. وضمن المخططات لتوفير الخدمات لهذه المناطق الجديدة تستعد الأمانة لإقامة مشروع خط قطارات خفيفة بين المناطق الجنوبية لعمّان وصولا إلى الزرقاء شرقا على امتداد 26 كيلومتر.\nكما شهدت عمّان الغربية نموا سريعا في العقدين الأخيرين حيث ظهرت أحياء بأكملها. وتحاول أمانة عمّان إقامة مشاريع تنموية طموحة في شرق عمّان خلال الفترة الحالية.\n مناطق عمان\nالقائمة التالية بأسماء مناطق عمان الكبرى الاثنان والعشرين والتي تقع ضمن عمان الغربية وعمان الشرقية:\n\nالغطاء الأخضر\n\nتتنوع التضاريس في مناطق عمّان الريفية بين السهول والجبال العالية والوديان، وتحيط الأماكن السياحية بجميع أنحاء العاصمة حيث منتزه عمّان القومي وحدائق البحرين والمدينة المائية جنوبا، مرورا بالطبيعة الجميلة في وادي السير وأم الأسود والحمر وماحص غربا، وانتهاء بقرى زي ودبين شمالا.\nيكاد يخلو وسط مدينة عمّان من الغابات فيما عدا بعض الأماكن مثل المدينة الرياضية والجامعة الأردنية وحدائق الحسين، وحدائق الملك عبد الله بالمقابلين، وغابات أخرى على طريق المطار.\nيُشار إلى أن زراعة الغابات قد بدأت في الأردن منذ أكثر من 60 عاماً مضت. وتجري معظم أنشطة التشجير حول العاصمة والمدن السكنية بالإضافة إلى زراعات جوانب الطرق، ومصدّات الرياح والزراعات في مجاري الوديان. تُزرع الأشجار أيضاً كجزء متكامل من نظم مندمجات الزراعة والغابات.\nفي عام 1995 تضمنت الزراعات حوالي 1000 كيلومتر من الأشجار على طول الطرق، 7000 كيلومتر من مصدات الرياح وأحزمة الوقاية و 500 كيلومتر من الأشجار على طول جوانب المجاري المائية.\n\nالمناخ\nالطقس في عمّان معتدل بشكل عام، إذ يسود مناخ متوسطي معظم مناطق العاصمة، خصوصًا في المرتفعات. بينما يسود بعض مناطقها المناخ شبه الصحراوي وخاصة في المناطق الشرقية منها. ترتفع درجات الحرارة صيفًا، وتصل أعلى مستوياتها في منتصف آب/ أغسطس، حيث تصل في بعض الأحيان إلى منتصف الثلاثينات مئوية. وتنخفض الحرارة شتاء لتصل في كانون الثاني/ يناير أحيانًا إلى الصفر أو ما دونه، حيث يتسبب ذلك بتساقط الثلوج على المرتفعات. ويعتدل المناخ في فصلي الربيع والخريف.\nأما بالنسبة لمعدلات الأمطار فتكون معدومة في بعض الأشهر مثل حزيران وتموز وآب. بينما تكون في أعلى معدلاتها في شهري كانون الثاني وشباط، حيث يمكن أن يصل مستواها إلى أكثر من 170 ميليمترًا.\n\nالسكان\nيعود أول تواجد بشري في مدينة عمّان إلى 9 الآف عام، حيث تشير آثار عين غزال شرق العاصمة إلى هذا. وخلال هذه الفترة الطويلة، شهدت المدينة الكثير من الحضارات كان أهمها العمونيون، وبعد ذلك احتل المدينة كل من اليونان والفرس والرومان والبيزنطيون. وبعد الفتح الإسلامي لبلاد الشام استمر التواجد البشري فيها حتى دخلت دفتر النسيان في نهاية العصر المملوكي أي في القرن السادس عشر، إلى أن تم إعادة اكتشافها في نهاية القرن التاسع عشر، وهجرة شعوب مختلفة من القوقاز، الذين تعرض كل منهم لاضطهاد في بلاده، فقامت الدولة العثمانية بتوزيعهم على أراضيها، وكانت عمان من هذه الأراضي. وبهذا، يبدأ تاريخ التواجد البشري في عمان الحديثة، حيث بدأت الحياة تدب في عمّان المعاصرة شيئا فشيئا بعد هجرة الشركس في بادئ الأمر من القوقاز عام 1880 أو قبله بقليل، وخاصة إلى محلتي الشابسوغ والمهاجرين، ومن ثم هجرة كل من الأرمن والشيشان. ثم مالبثت أن استقبلت المدينة الكثير من العرب من مختلف المناطق، وبالأخص ذوي الأصول الأردنية (الذين سكن بعضهم تجمعات محددة، مثل حي الطفايلة الذي يعد أكبر تجمعي لأبناء المحافظات في العاصمة ويقع في جبل الجوفة)، مع المواطنين ذوي الأصول الفلسطينية الذين هاجروا من مختلف مناطق فلسطين، والذين تزايدوا بشكل كبير، حتى أصبح العرب هم الغالبية المطلقة.\n\nالتركيبة السكانية\nتعتبر عمّان من أكثر المدن تسارعا بالنمو في منطقة الشرق الأوسط، ويقطنها مايزيد عن ثلث سكان المملكة. ويبلغ عدد سكان عمّان الكبرى بضواحيها اليوم حوالي 4 ملايين نسمة، يدين الغالبية الساحقة منهم بالإسلام. كما يُعتبر المسيحيون من العرب والأرمن وغيرهم، المكون الديني الثاني بعد المسلمين، ويشكلون ما نسبته 6% من السكان من مختلف الطوائف. كما يكفل الدستور الأردني للجميع حرية ممارسة الأديان. يُشار إلى أن عدد سكان المدينة قد ازداد بشكل ملحوظ بعد عدة منعطفات مهمة شهدتها المنطقة كان أولها حرب 1948 وحرب 1967، حيث لجأ ونزح مئات الآلاف من فلسطين. كما كان لأحداث حرب الخليج الثانية دور كبير بازدياد العدد، حيث عاد مئات الآلاف من الأردنيين من الكويت وباقي دول الخليج بين عاميّ 1991 و 1992. هذا بالإضافة إلى تضاعف مساحة المدينة بعد ضم ضواحي كبيرة إليها في عام 2007 (شكلت عمّان الكبرى). كما يشكل اليوم المقيمون العرب من الدول المجاورة، وخاصة من سوريا والعراق، جزءًا لا بأس به من سكان المدينة، والذين ازدادت أعدادهم بشكل كبير بعد كل من الغزو الأمريكي للعراق والأزمة السورية. بالإضافة إلى وجود مئات الآلاف من العمّال والعاملات المقيمين من الدول الآسيوية ومصر. كما تتواجد جاليات غربية عديدة، يوجد لمعظمها معاهد ثقافية ومدارس أكاديمية. قدّرت أمانة عمان الكبرى أن عدد سكان المدينة، دون القرى التابعة لها، سيصل سنة 2025 إلى حوالي 6.4 مليون نسمة، أي ثلاثة أضعاف الرقم لعام 2007.\nإن المجتمع العمّاني حاليًا هو خليط من عائلات ذات أصول مختلفة؛ شرق أردنية، وفلسطينية، وحجازية، وسورية، وأقلية من الشركس والشيشان والأرمن والتركمان والأكراد. ولقد ظهر من هذا المكون الكثير من المشاهير الذين ساهموا بنهضة المدينة والبلد بشكل عام على جميع الأصعدة والمجالات، كالأدب والفنون والهندسة والطب والرياضة والإعلام والاقتصاد والتكنلوجيا والتعليم والسياسة والجيش.\nباستثناء بعض من عشائر البلقاء (كاللوزي وأبو قورة والعبد اللات والعدوان)، فلا يوجد فعليا مِن سكّان عمّان مَن هم ذو أصول عمّانية، ولكن هناك أجيال نشأت منذ ما يزيد عن قرن بعد هجرة مئات الآلاف من هذه المناطق المجاورة، ومن ضمنها المدن الأردنية القريبة كالسلط وإربد والطفيلة والكرك ومعان. يأتي هذا بعد خلو المدينة تقريبا من سكانها لعدة قرون - منذ القرن السادس عشر، نتيجة للزلازل وانتشار الأوبئة كالطاعون، بالإضافة إلى إهمال العثمانيين لها في معظم فترة حكمهم لـبلاد الشام.\n\nاللاجئون\nكانت عمّان تستقبل المزيد من السكان عبر العقود الستة الماضية من دول ابتلي أهلها بالحروب والثورات. وقد استقبلت المدينة كغيرها من مدن الأردن العديد من اللاجئين من دول الجوار خلال أزمات القرن الماضي وبالأخص من فلسطين ولبنان والعراق وسوريا. يطيب للبعض البقاء والاستقرار في عمّان ويختار البعض الآخر العودة إلى بلاده عند استقرار الأمور فيها أو متابعة الهجرة إلى دول أخرى. ينصهر الكثيرون في المجتمع العمّاني ولكن تبقى فئة في تجمعات سكانية تحمل هويتهم الأصلية كمخيمات اللاجئين الفلسطينيين. فبالرغم من الانصهار الكبير الذي حدث ببينهم وبين معظم فئات المجتمع إلا أنه لا زال عدد منهم يعيش في المخيمات. وبحسب إحصاءات وكالة الغوث التابعة للأمم المتحدة، يقطن هذه المخيمات قرابة 20% من فلسطينيي الأردن. تقوم وكالة الغوث، أو الأونروا، بالإشراف على جميع المخيمات العشرة في المملكة والتي تشمل مخيمات عمان الأربعة منذ النكبة، وهي مخيم البقعة ومخيم الوحدات ومخيم ماركا (شنلر) ومخيم الحسين.\nيُشار بالذكر إلى أن المدينة تستضيف مئات اللاجئين من دول بعيدة نسبيًا، كالصومال والسودان وجنوب السودان، حيث يتواجد على أرض الأردن بشكل عام 44 جنسية لاجئة حسب تقرير نشرته المفوضية السامية للأمم المتحدة لشؤون اللاجئين عام 2014.\n\nالمواصلات والاتصالات\nالنقل والطرق\nشكّل التخطيط المدني القديم لعمّان تحديا لمواكبة تطورات العصر واحتياجات المدينة، وعمّان ليست بالمدينة الثرية، ولكنها تمكنت من تخطي الصعاب وما زالت تُنشئ طرقا جديدة تحل أزمات المدينة السابقة. إذ توجد الآن في عمّان عدة طرق سريعة، تربط أجزاء المدينة بعضها ببعض كما تربطها بمدن المملكة الأخرى، فهناك شارع الأردن وشارع الاستقلال وشارع الشهيد والحزام الدائري وطريق ياجوز وشارع المدينة الطبية وشارع الجامعة وأوتوستراد الزرقاء وشارع المطار، والطريق الصحراوي. ويعتبر جسر عبدون المعلق ونفق وادي الحدادة وطريق عمان التنموي وغيرها من منشآت الطرق الجديدة من أهم مشاريع أمانة عمان الكبرى للتخفيف من وطأة الزحام في الشوارع.\n\nبدأت أمانة عمّان الكبرى مشروع الباص السريع (BRT) في عام 2010. تعتبر شبكة الحافلات السريعة من أهم مشاريع النقل التي تشهدها عمّان حتى يومنا هذا، إذ يهدف هذا المشروع - والذي انتهى تنفيذ مرحلته الأولى في عام 2012 إلا أن حكومة رئيس الوزراء معروف البخيت أوقفت المرحلة الثانية منه لوجود شبهة فساد - إلى إحداث نقلة نوعيّة في واقع الحركة والتنقّل في المدينة – نقلة تمهّد الطريق للوصول إلى مدينة عصرية مستدامة قابلة للحياة. إن فكرة خط الباصات السريعة تعتمد على تخصيص مسارب لحركة باصات النقل العام، ويحظر على المركبات الأخرى استخدام هذه المسارب. وبذلك يمكن نقل أعداد كبيرة من الناس من خلال هذه المسارب بسرعة وسهولة. ويمكن أن تصل سعة النقل لكل مسرب حوالي 40,000 راكب في الساعة في كل اتجاه، بينما لا تتجاوز سعة النقل في المسارب التقليدية التي تستخدمها السيارات والحافلات والمركبات الأخرى الـ 3,250 راكباً. وبالإضافة إلى ذلك، فإن تكلفة بناء خطوط الباصات السريعة مقبولة جداً، وقد لا تتجاوز 5% من تكلفة بناء نظام نقل يعتمد على السكك الحديدية مثلاً. كذلك استهلاكها للطاقة وكمية الانبعاثات الكلية الناجمة عن النقل بالباصات أقل من تلك الناتجة عن النقل بالسيارات العادية. إلاّ أن المشروع قد أثار جدلا كبيرا في الفترة الحالية بعد توقفه، مما سبّب باتهامات شعبية كثيرة للقائمين عليه.\n\nأما خدمات النقل التقليدية في عمان فهي موزعة بين الحافلات والسيارات، وهناك شبكة من السيارات للنقل العام تدعى «سرفيس» أي أنها تسير في خطوط محددة ويتشارك الركاب باستخدامها ودفع أجرتها. كما يوجد شبكة من سيارات الأجرة التي تلبي الطلبات الخاصة موزعة في جميع أنحاء المدينة. ذلك عدا عن السيارات السياحية التي تُؤجر ليقودها السائح بنفسه. هذا بالإضافة إلى خدمة التاكسي المميز، وخدمة النقل باستخدام التطبيقات الذكية (مثل تطبيقات كريم وأوبر). كما أن شبكات الحافلات ضمن خدمات النقل العام تؤدي الغرض نفسه. ويوجد في المدينة مجمعان كبيران للحافلات هي مجمع باصات الشمال، والمجمع الجنوبي.\n\nالاتصالات\nنهجت الأردن في مجال الاتصالات بصورة مقبولة فمن شبكة كادت أن تكون غير مجدية في الثمانينات إلى خصخصة الاتصالات، واليوم هناك عدة شركات خاصة تقدم خدمة الإنترنت وثلاث شركات لتقديم خدمة الهاتف المحمول وشبكة اتصالات أرضية متميزة ووفرة في أرقام الهاتف.\n\nالطيران\nلعمّان مطاران: مطار الملكة علياء الدولي الذي أُنجز عام 1983 ومطار عمان المدني الذي يُستخدم للطيران المدني الإقليمي وللطيران العسكري. وهذان المطاران تنطلق منهما عدة خطوط طيران، وشركة طيران الملكية الأردنية تستخدم مطار الملكة علياء كما تستخدمه جميع شركات الطيران الدولي الأخرى. أما شركة طيران الأردنية فتستخدم مطار عمان وكذلك شركات الطيران التي تطير ضمن الإقليم فقط. يشار بالذكر إلى أنه تم رفع القدرة الاستيعابية لمطار الملكة علياء من 3.2 مليون مسافر /السنة إلى 9 ملايين عند اكتمال أعمال الإنشاءات عام 2012 ليصبح واحدا من أهم الوجهات العالمية في المنطقة.\n\nسكة الحديد\nيمر بالمدينة خط سكة حديد الحجاز حيث توجد محطة عمان على الخط بين بلاد الشام ومكة المكرمة انطلاقاً من دمشق والذي توقف العمل به منذ بدايات القرن العشرين، ويُعتبر المبنى الأثري للمحطة من معالم عمّان التاريخية. وتقع المحطة في منطقة عمان الشرقية غرب منطقة ماركا وشرق المدرج الروماني بالقرب من مطار ماركا الدولي. يُستخدم هذا الخط الآن لنقل الركاب والبضائع بين عمّان ودمشق فقط. ويعمل الأردن على الاستفادة من بعض أملاك هذا الخط في بناء مشروع آخر يعود جزء من أرباحه على الخط الحجازي، حيث سيمتد مشروع خط قطارات خفيفة بين المناطق الجنوبية لعمّان وصولاً إلى الزرقاء شرقاً والذي سيمتد لمسافة 26 كيلومتر.\n\nالعمارة والتخطيط الحضري\nالتخطيط العمراني\nاتبعت المدينة في نموها العشوائي في بادئ الأمر، نظرية النمو حول نواة واحدة، حيث كانت هذه النواة هي المسجد الحسيني والمنطقة التجارية الممتدة من راس العين إلى موقع المكتبة الوطنية (مقر أمانة عمّان القديم) وعلى جانبي وادي سيل عمّان. إلا أن عملية النمو لم تكن حلقية أو دائرية حول النواة، بل تميزت بإضافة قطاعات متفاوتة المساحة في المرحلة الواحدة ومختلفة في اتجاهات نموها خلال المراحل المختلفة. حيث كان نمو المدينة يأتي على شكل تشنجات مفاجئة نتجت عن عوامل سياسية مرت بها المنطقة، أدت إلى انفجارات سكانية غير متوقعة. حيث أثرت بدورها على الطابع المعماري للمدينة والذي تكوّن بشكل تراكمي طيلة القرن الفائت. إن التوسع الذي شهدته عمّان في هذه المرحلة كان باتجاهين: الأول على الطريق الواصل بين وسط البلد ووادي السير، والثانية بين وسط البلد والسلط عن طريق صويلح، حيث رُبطت هاتان المنطقتان بعمّان. وعلى طول مسار هذين الطريقين انتشرت دواوير عمّان وميادينها، التي هي شاهد على مراحل تطور المدينة.\nفي عام 1956، وُضِّع أول مخطط هيكلي لعمّان بمعناه الصحيح، يحدد شكل المدينة ووظائفها والاستعمالات المختلفة وخطوط النقل والمواصلات وغيرها من الخصائص العامة. وفي عام 1964 باشرت أمانة العاصمة بوضع الأنظمة التفصيلية التي ساهمت فيما بعد بتطبيق محتويات المخططات التنظيمية التي أشرف على وضعها قسم التخطيط في الأمانة بالتعاون مع بعض الخبراء بالأمم المتحدة.\n\nإلا أن الزيادة غير المتوقعة في عدد السكان بالمدينة نتيجة الحروب المتلاحقة في المنطقة، أدى إلى عدم تبني المخطط الشمولي القديم، وإن كان هناك عدة محاولات أخرى، إلا أنها كانت تصطدم أيضا بنفس المشكلة. أما مؤخرا، فقد شهدت أمانة عمان الكبرى تطورا كبيرا، حيث توسعت عمان بشكل مدروس لم تشهده المدينة من قبل. ونالت خطة مدينة عمان الشمولية جوائز عالمية منها جائزة القيادة العالمية في تخطيط المدن وجائزة المدينة عن قارة آسيا لعام 2007.\nإن من أهم المشكلات الاجتماعية الحضرية في عمّان حاليا، هي الطفرة الكبيرة في النمو السكاني والحضري. ومع زيادة عدد السكان، واجهت المدينة عدة مشاكل منها: ظهور مناطق عشوائية، نقص المساكن، عدم كفاية المياه، مشكلة المرور داخل المدينة.\n\nتبلغ مساحة الأراضي المبنية في عمّان 640 كم² بنسبة 38% من إجمالي مساحة مناطق الأمانة البالغة 1668 كم²، ووالأراضي غير المبنية 1027 كم² بنسبة 62%. كما تبين أن مساحات الأراضي التجارية 20 كم² بنسبة 5%، والأراضي الصناعية 65 كم² بنسبة 15%، والمرافق العامة (مؤسسات حكومية، مدارس، الحدائق العامة...) 20 كم² بنسبة 5%، والأراضي الزراعية 21 كم² بنسبة 5%.\nبالإضافة إلى شوارع عمّان التي تشكل مساحتها 191 كم² بنسبة 11% من مساحة مناطق الأمانة، تعتبر الأدراج من سمات مدينة عمان العريقة، حيث تنتشر على سفوح جبالها لتصل البيوت ببعضها البعض حين تعجز الشوارع عن أداء تلك المهمة، إذ يخيل لزائر عمان إنها مدينة تقف على قدميها باستمرار، وقد اتخذت بعض بيوتها مواقع لها، ولم يكن ممكنا وصلها مع باقي أجزاء المدينة إلا بواسطة الدرج. وبهذا تعتبر هذه الأدراج القديمة بحدّ ذاتها معلما تاريخيا. ومن هذه الأدراج: الكلحة، اللويبدة، رغدان وبسمان. ولقد تم مؤخرًا تحديد مناطق الأبراج بأربع مناطق فقط هي: المركز التجاري الجديد لمنطقة العبدلي، مركز تقاطعات الطرق الرئيسة (على امتداد ممر وادي عبدون)، بوابة عمان الشمالية (وتقع في الجبيهة بمحاذاة شارع الأردن)، بوابة عمان الجنوبية (هي المنطقة المتاخمة من الناحية الشرقية لطريق المطار ومحاط بالطريق الدائري لوادي عبدون).\n\nالنسيج الحضري\nتشغل المناطق السكنية الجانب الأكبر من مساحة عمّان، وتتوزع قطاعات السكن أ، ب، ج على الأحياء الراقية من العاصمة، وهي الواقعة في الجزء الغربي (عمان الغربية) كالشميساني والمدينة الرياضية وجبل عمّان وعبدون ودير غبار، وينتشر قطاعا السكن ج، د في المناطق الشرقية (عمان الشرقية) والجنوبية الغربية كجبل القصور والهاشمي والقلعة والجوفة وماركا والأشرفية ونزال. حيث تحدد الأمانة القطاع وفقا لعدة عوامل عمرانية وتخطيطية.\nلقد تم تصنيف عمّان عام 2010، ضمن 14 مدينة عربية كمدينة عالمية (أو Global City)، وفقا لمجموعة دراسات العولمة والمدن العالمية GaWC، التي تتخذ من بريطانيا مقرا لها. حيث يأخذ التصنيف بعين الاعتبار: الخصائص الاقتصادية (كمؤشرات سوق الأسهم / القيمة السوقية، توفر الخدمات المالية، إجمالي الناتج المحلي)، والخصائص السياسية (كحجم المدينة من حيث عدد السكان أو حجم التجمعات الحضرية، معايير جودة المعيشة ومدى تطور المدينة، المشاركة والتأثير في مناسبات دولية)، والخصائص الثقافية (كمدى شهرة المدينة عالميا، تواجد المؤسسات الثقافية، المرافق الرياضية، المؤسسات التعليمية والجامعات، مواقع التراث العالمي، والمزارات الدينية)، والبنية التحتية (كنظام النقل والمطارات، ووجود قاعدة اتصالات حديثة مثل الألياف البصرية وخدمات الهاتف المحمول، والخدمات الصحية كالمستشفيات). ويتم اختيار المدن وفقا لتطبيقها لهذه المعايير، أو افتقادها لبعضها. حيث احتلت بموجبه عمّان مركزًا ضمن فئة +Gamma، من بين التصنيفات المتعددة للمدن في العالم.\n\nالهوية المعمارية\nيتميز البناء في عمّان عمومًا باستخدام الحجر كجزء أساسي يدعم واجهات البناء من جهاته الأربعة. وهذا لا ينحصر في جزء مُعيّن بالمدينة، ولكن تتميز عمان الغربية بجمال العمارة وجودة الخدمات وانتشار الفنادق من فئة الخمسة نجوم ومعظم الوزارات المنشأة على أسس ومقاييس متميزة في العمارة والبناء. أضفت الحجارة المستخدمة في بناء مدينة عمان فناً تميزت به هذه المدينة وأضفت على طابعها المعماري لمسة جمالية دفعت المهندسين إلى ممارسة إبداعهم في تنوع كبير من أساليب العمارة باستخدام الحجر.\nبحسب مجموعة من المهندسين المعماريين حملوا على أنفسهم أن ينتجوا نماذج من فن العمارة في عمّان، أكدوا تأثر العمارة في الأردن بالموروث الحضاري لمدينة عمّان المعماري الإسلامي والروماني واليوناني. إلا أن معظمهم أكد أن الفن الإسلامي هو غاية وأمنية بالنسبة لهم. ويعيب المهندسون على بعض الأبنية والتي يسمونها أبنية التجميع والتي يحمل التصميم فيها سمات عمارة الغرب المتزاوجة مع تصميمات المنطقة بدون الأخذ بعين الاعتبار الطابع المعماري الذي يميّز المنطقة وتاريخها والاعتبارات الثقافية والحضارية الأخرى. وبعضهم يصمم مبنى تحمل واجهاته أكثر من ثقافة وتراث أطلق عليه المهندسون «أسلوب الإبهار» والخالي من المضمون والموروث والفاشل هندسيا وذكروا عددا من تلك النماذج في أماكن متعددة في عمان. لم ينكر المهندسون الحاجة أحيانا إلى إدخال بعض المواد العصرية للبناء مثل الزجاج والصفائح المعدنية ضمن تصميم مدروس يراعي تطوير العمارة العربية مبينين أن هذا التداخل مطلوب ولا غبار عليه.\n\nإن أساليب العمارة في عمان عديدة ولا يمكن حصرها. وقد تتعدد بتعدد الثقافات المعمارية التي حملها خريجو الهندسة الأردنيون من الشرق والغرب وعادوا بعد تخرجهم ليزرعوا ثمارها في جنبات المدينة وما حملوه من مذاهب معمارية متعددة. ويبدو أنه كان لتنتشر نتيجة لذلك التشكيل المتعدد فوضى معمارية هائلة لولا الاستعمال الموّحد للحجر الأردني في جميع هذه المباني. أدى هذا إلى استعمال واسع لحجر البناء الذي توفر بصورة لبّت الحاجة لطبيعة عمّان الجغرافية والطبوغرافية كمدينة أحيطت بعدة جبال شكلت محاجرها رافدًا أساسيًا لتزويد المدينة بالحجارة. ولكن اتساع المدينة المطرد مع الزمن دفعها للبحث عن مصدر للحجارة من أماكن أخرى في المملكة ومن محافظات جنوب الأردن وخصوصا من محافظة معان.\n\nوسط المدينة الجديد\nتم البدء بمشروع العبدلي أو مشروع تطوير منطقة العبدلي في عام 2005 وكان متوقعًا الانتهاء منه عام 2010. وسيصبح قلب عمّان الجديد ومركزها. يقوم المشروع على أرض مساحتها 804 كيلومترات مربعة، من مساحة مبنية تزيد على 1,7 مليون أمتار مربعة تضمّ مجمّعات سكنية ومكاتب وفنادق وشقق مخدومة ومحلات تجارية ومراكز للترفيه؛ وهو بذلك سيصبح محور الأعمال والسكن في العاصمة الأردنية عمّان.\nلقد تم تطوير العبدلي ليكون مثابة مركز ذكي للمدينة حيث يجمع سوية البنية التحتية لوسائط الإعلام والاتصال، بما يكفل إيصال أكثر التقنيات تطورًا إلى كل منزل ومكتب ومتجر، بينما تتوفر فيه حلول طاقة عامة وأنظمة غاز مركزية بما يضمن بيئة سليمة وودية فضلاً عن التوفير الكبير في فاتورة الطاقة. وسيكون مركز المدينة مجهزًا كليًا بأنظمة متطورة تقنيًا لإدارة المباني وللحماية من الحرائق ولإدارة السلامة والتدابير الاحتياطية. ساهم مشروع تطوير العبدلي في إيجاد شبكات طرق وحلول مرورية ممتازة حول المشروع وداخله، بما يؤمّن الانسيابية لنحو 90,000 شخص يوميًا من السكان والعاملين والزوار عندما يعمل المشروع بكامل طاقته.\n\nدور العبادة\nيُشكل المسلمون غالبية سكان عمان حيث يشكلون ما نسبته 94%، ويشكل المسيحيون النسبة الباقية أي ما نسبته 6% من السكان من مختلف الطوائف، ويكفل الدستور للجميع حرية ممارسة الأديان، ولذلك تجد في عمان مجموعة متنوعة من المساجد والكنائس موزعة في مختلف أنحاء العاصمة اعتني في تصميمها وبناؤها لتتميز وتكمل نسيج المدينة المعماري. لقد تزايد عدد المساجد في الأردن بشكل لافت وملحوظ في الآونة الأخيرة وبارقام قياسية شهدت ارتفاعا كبيرا فاقت دول عربية وإسلامية مجاورة. وبلغ عدد المساجد العاملة في المملكة 6243 مسجدا - بلغت حصة عمّان منها 25%.\n\nيُلاحظ بشكل واضح أن تصميم معظم مساجد المدينة قد تم على الطرازين الأموي والفاطمي، نتيجة للطبيعة الجغرافية التي حتّمت أن تكون عمّان جزءا من محيطها المعماري والحضاري الممتد من سوريا وفلسطين ولبنان حتى مصر.\nيُشار بالذكر إلى أن المهاجرين المسلمين الشركس والشيشان قد ساهموا في بناء أول مساجد المدينة في العصر الحديث منذ نهاية القرن التاسع عشر. وتشهد المساجد الأثرية في مناطق تواجدهم - خاصة في وادي السير وراس العين ووسط البلد على هذا الأمر.\nيُعد كل من مسجد أبو درويش، مسجد الملك عبد الله الأول، المسجد الحسيني، مسجد الملك الحسين، مسجد الشريعة، مسجد أبو قورة، مسجد الكالوتي، مسجد الروضة، ومسجد سيدو الكردي من أكبر مساجد المدينة وأشهرها. أما بالنسبة للكنائس، فتوجد في عمّان العشرات منها والتي تخدم جميع الطوائف المسيحية، ومن أهمها: كنيسة دخول السيد إلى الهيكل في الصويفية، كنيسة مطرانية الروم الكاثوليك، كنيسة قصر البشارات، كنيسة الأقباط، كنيسة البشارة في اللويبدة، كنيسة الاتحاد المسيحي الإنجيلية في جبل عمّان، كنيسة الراعي الصالح الإنجيلية اللوثرية في أم السماق، والكنائس المعمدانية في الرابية وأبو نصير والشميساني وخلدا وصويلح وغيرها.\n\nالثقافة والفنون\nبدأت البوادر الجادة لظهور حركة تشكيلية في عمّان في أوائل الخمسينات من القرن الفائت، ففي عام 1951 أقام «المنتدى العربي» أول معرض جماعي في الأردن. وبعده بسنة، تأسس معهد الموسيقى والرسم في المدينة. وفي أواخر الخمسينيات، أرسلت الحكومة أول مبعوثين أردنيين لدراسة الفن في الخارج، وهم: رفيق اللحام، ومهنا الدرة، وأحمد نعواش، وكمال بلاطة، والتحق بعضهم بأكاديمية الفنون الجميلة في روما. وفي عقد الستينيات بدأ الموفدون بالعودة إلى عمّان، وممارسة فنهم، وتدريس مادة الرسم في المدارس الثانوية، ومع عودتهم ازداد النشاط الفني، وكذلك أخذ عدد المعارض التي كانت تقام في القدس وعمان يتضاعف، والمحاضرات الفنية كذلك، كما أخذت وزارة السياحة مبادرة المشاركة بأعمال الفنانين الأردنيين في المعارض الدولية.\n\nفي عام 1966 تأسست دائرة الثقافة والفنون، التابعة لوزارة الإعلام، وهدفها دعم الفنون التشكيلية والمسرحية والموسيقى والأدب وتشجيعها. ومع بداية السبعينيات تضاعف النشاط الفني في المدينة، ففي عام 1972 أسست دائرة الثقافة والفنون «معهد الفنون والموسيقى»، وقد أُريد له أن يكون نواة لأكاديمية فنية، ومدة الدراسة في المعهد سنتان، تعطى فيها دروس في الفن والتصوير والنحت وفن الطباعة والخزف، وقد تخرج منه عدد من الفنانين الأردنيين استطاع بعضهم إكمال دراسته الفنية العليا في الخارج، معتمدين على التأسيس الذي حصلوا عليه في المعهد.\nلا شك أن الحركة التشكيلية الأردنية تعتبر من أنشط الحركات الفنية في عمّان قياسا إلى الحركة المسرحية، أو الموسيقية مثلا، فقد شهدت فترة التسعينيات من القرن الماضي والسنوات الماضية من الألفية الجديدة، نشاطا تشكيليا ملفتا للنظر، وقد تجلى هذا النشاط بغزارة إقامة المعارض الفنية للفنانين الأردنيين والفنانين العرب والعالميين، وكان واضحا أن هناك ما يشبه الهجرة للفنانين العراقيين بوجه خاص إلى الأردن منذ بداية التسعينيات أما للإقامة الدائمة، أو المؤقتة في طريقهم للخارج، وهذا انعكس حراكا فنيا واضحا على الساحة الأردنية، وتواصلا بين الفنانين الأردنيين والعراقيين، وجد تعبيراته في ازدياد عدد المعارض الفنية، وإنشاء قاعات العرض الخاصة التي تزايدت أعدادها بشكل كبير، والتي تستقطب تجارب الفنانين الأردنيين والعرب والعالميين مما يشير إلى تنامي الوعي الفني وانتشاره بين الجمهور، كما يؤشر إلى ازدياد أعداد الفنانين الأردنيين، وإقبال العديد من الطلبة على دراسة الفن التشكيلي، مما دفع إلى فتح كلية للفنون الجميلة في الجامعة الأردنية في عمان في عام 2003 تدرس من ضمن تخصصاتها الرسم، الجرافيك والتصميم وغيرها من مفردات الفن التشكيلي وتخصصاته المختلفة إلى جانب المسرح والموسيقى.\nأما بالنسبة للموسيقى، فكانت حاضرة منذ أوائل القرن العشرين، خاصة أن هناك تداخل ما بين الثقافة البدوية والحضرية في المدينة. أما بالنسبة للموسيقى الكلاسيكية، فهناك أوركسترا وطنية تتخذ من عمان مقرا لها وهي أوركسترا عمان السيمفوني، التي ولدت من رحم أوركسترا المعهد الوطني للموسيقى (مؤسسة الملك الحسين) وبدعم من أمانة عمان الكبرى. قدمت الأوركسترا باكورة حفلاتها في شهر كانون الثاني / يناير 2007. ويزخر الموسم الثقافي السنوي لأوركسترا عمان السمفوني ببرنامج منوع من الحفلات العامة، تقدم في ثالث أربعاء من كل شهر.\n\nعاصمة الثقافة العربية والإسلامية\nتشهد عمّان ازديادًا بالأنشطة والمهرجانات المحلية والعربية، وذلك منذ إعلانها عاصمة للثقافة العربية عام 2002، يبرز من بينها إطلاق مشروع مسرح التراث الموسيقي الأردني، وافتتاح مشغل النحت العربي، ومهرجان عمان للأفلام الوثائقية، والمعرض الشامل للفن التشكيلي العربي، بالإضافة لافتتاح شارع الثقافة،\nمن جهة أخرى، فقد تم إعلان مدينة عمّان عام 2017 عاصمةً للثقافة الإسلامية عن المنطقة العربية.\nتنتشر في عمّان عدد كبير من المعارض ومراكز الفنون الجميلة وعدّة أسواق شعبية تعرض إسهامات الفنانين في وسط البلد وجبل عمان وجبل اللويبدة، حيث شهدت هذه الأماكن حراكا ثقافيا نوعيّا في العقدين الأخيرين، زمن أشهر تلك المراكز؛ دارة الفنون، دار الأندى، محترف رمال للفنون وكثير من المعارض الأخرى. ويجدر بالذكر إلى أن وزارة الثقافة في الأردن قد تبنت مؤخرا تجربة المدن الثقافية، أو مايطلق عليه عاصمة الثقافة الأردنية - كما حدث في إربد والسلط والكرك والزرقاء ومعان تباعا، مما أتاح قدر أكبر للانفتاح الثقافي والأدبي على المدن الأردنية الباقية وعدم حصرها بالعاصمة، والتي سبق لها ان نالت لقب عاصمة الثقافة العربية.\n\nوسط عمّان الثقافي\nتتضمن منطقة راس العين الكثير من المرافق الثقافية التي تكمل دور أمانة عمان الكبرى في إحياءها ابتداءً من مسجد النورين وساحة النوافير وساحة النخيل ومن ثم قاعة المدينة ومبنى موظفي أمانة عمان الكبرى وانتهاءً بمركز الحسين الثقافي، حيث تبلغ مساحة المشروع حوالي (20) دونماً من اصل مساحة الساحة البالغة (143) دونماً. وتتضمن هذه المساحة على مقر الأمانة، متحف الأردن، مسرح مركز الحسين الثقافي، المعهد الوطني للموسيقى، بالإضافة إلى سوق الحرف الشعبية. وكان مُقررًا أيضًا أن يُنفذ مشروع دار للأوبرا في هذه المنطقة، هي دارة الملك عبد الله الثاني للثقافة والفنون، إلا أنه توقف وتم تحويله إلى سوق شعبي في عام 2014.\nتحوي عمّان على عدد لا بأس به من المتاحف، مثل المتحف الوطني للفنون الجميلة، متحف الأزياء الشعبية، متحف صرح الشهيد، متحف الحياة البرلمانية، متحف الآثار الأردني، متحف الأطفال، متحف السيارات الملكي، القرية الثقافية في حدائق الحسين، بالإضافة إلى عدد كبير من المراكز الثقافية الأجنبية.\nيوجد في جبل عمان أيضًا، سوق مختص بالحرف اليدوية والثقافة الشعبية، يُدعى سوق جارا، وهو سوق موسمي يبدأ أسبوعيًا في كل يوم جمعة خلال شهر أيار/مايو، وينتهي في شهر تشرين الأول/أكتوبر. تُقيمه سنويا رابطة سكان جبل عمان. يرتاده السياح بكثرة خلال فصل الصيف.\nمن الجدير بالذكر إلى أن المدينة تستضيف كل عام مهرجانات ثقافية عالمية ومحلية؛ من أهمها معرض الكتاب العالمي، مهرجان أيام عمان المسرحية، مهرجان الأردن، مهرجان الموسيقى والغناء الصوفي، مهرجان صيف عمان، مهرجان عمان للرقص المعاصر ومهرجان عمان للكوميديا، وغيرها.\n\nالإعلام\nمعظم الصحف الأردنية الكبرى ومراكز البث موجودة في عمّان. كما تُشكل المدينة مركزا إعلاميًا للصحفيين الدوليين الآتين لتغطية أخبار المنطقة المتجددة سواء في فلسطين، العراق وسوريا، أو في مناطق قريبة أخرى.\nتأسست في عمّان عام 1969 وكالة الأنباء الأردنية، وهي وكالة الأنباء الرسمية في الأردن. كما تأسست المدينة الإعلامية الأردنية في عام 2001، وهي الأولى من نوعها في منطقة بلاد الشام، والتي يُؤمل منها أن تجعل من عمّان محورا رئيسيا لشبكات البث الفضائي. يوجد الآنالكثير من المحطات التي ترسل بثها منها. تحاول عمّان اليوم منافسة مدن أخرى ذات الخبرة والإمكانيات في مجال الإعلام مثل بيروت ودبي والقاهرة. وقد تأسس في 2003 الهيئة الملكية الأردنية للأفلام، وهي مؤسسة تقدم الدعم لإنتاج الأفلام والمسلسلات التلفزيونية في الأردن وتدريب الناشئة وصانعي الأفلام والمهنيين من الأردن والمنطقة في جميع مجالات السينما والإنتاج التلفزيوني. تقدم الهيئة برامج وورش تدريبية على مدار السنة، من أجل بناء صناعة أفلام حديثة ورائدة ذات مستوى عالمي في الأردن، بحيث يتمكن جميع صانعي الأفلام في الشرق الأوسط إنتاج أفلام بحرية جنباً إلى جنب أكثر فناني العالم موهبة.\n\nالاقتصاد\nكانت الليرة العثمانية هي العملة المتداولة في عمّان أثناء الحكم العثماني. استمر ذلك حتى أُنشئت إمارة شرق الأردن تحت وصاية الانتداب البريطاني، فتم استخدام الجنيه المصري بشكل مؤقت إلى أن أصدر الجنيه الفلسطيني عام 1927 حيث اعتمد في الدولة واستخدم حتى مطلع الخمسينيات من القرن الماضي، عندما صدر الدينار الأردني وصار هو العملة الرسمية. كما يُستخدم الدولار الأمريكي واليورو إلى جانب الدينار في عمليات البيع والشراء. ما زال سكان عمّان يستخدمون كلمة الليرة رغم تعاملهم بالدينار نتيجة للتأثر الطويل بالعثمانيين الذين حكموا بلاد الشام قرابة 4 قرون.\n\nتُعتبر عمّان اليوم مركزًا للحياة الاقتصادية في الأردن، الذي انتعش اقتصاده برجوع رؤوس الأموال والمستثمرين من الكويت والخليج سنة 1990 حيث بدأت خطط التنمية تلقى طريقها في المدينة من إنشاء مشاريع كثيرة. ويعتمد اقتصاد المدينة على قطاعات البناء والبنوك والتأمين والتجارة وبشكل كبير على قطاع السياحة والفندقة، بالإضافة للصناعات الغذائية والخفيفة والمتوسطة. تتخذ كبرى الشركات الأردنية وعدد من الشركات الإقليمية والعالمية في المنطقة من المدينة مقرا لها. كذلك يمتلك العديد من مواطني دول الخليج العربي وكبار أثرياء العرب عقارات وأعمال في عمّان الغربية. في العقدين الأخيرين قامت العديد من الشركات الخليجية والعربية والعالمية بالاستثمار في عمّان تتصدرها الشركات الكويتية.\nاحتلت عمّان في عام 2007 المرتبة الأولى بين المدن العربية من حيث غلاء المعيشة فيها - حسب «مجلة الإيكونومست البريطانية». حيث أن ارتفاع أسعار المساكن والعقارات والأراضي، إلى جانب ارتفاع أسعار النفط الذي أثر على كلف الإنتاج وزيادة قيمة المستوردات، عوامل ساهمت في تربع عمّان على صدارة قائمة أغلى المدن عربيا.\n\nبورصة عمان وغرفة تجارة عمّان\nتأسست بورصة عمان في عام 1999 كمؤسسة مستقلة تُدار من قبل القطاع الخاص لمزاولة العمل كسوق منظم لتداول الأوراق المالية في المملكة. تقوم البورصة بتوفير أنظمة إلكترونية ووسائل ربط وقاعات مجهزة بالأدوات والوسائل التقنية الحديثة. ومراقبة عمليات التداول في السوق والتنسيق مع الهيئة في متابعة تلك العمليات. كما قامت بوضع معايير للسلوك المهني لضمان التزام أعضائها بمبادئ التداول السليم، كما تحرص على ضرورة النشر الفوري والصحيح للمعلومات لجميع المهتمين بنفس الوقت. أما غرفة تجارة عمّان تتكون من 12 عضوا منتخبين عن طريق الاقتراع الحر والمباشر من قبل أعضاء الهيئة العامة للغرفة البالغ عددهم حوالي 35,000 عضو، ومدة عضوية المجلس 4 سنوات، وتهدف الغرفة إلى قيادة القطاع التجاري نحو مستقبل أفضل للأعمال واقتصاد وطني حر.\n\nالأسواق\nازدهرت حركة التجارة في عمان منذ القدم، ففيها عدة أسواق قديمة، وهي كالآتي: سوق السكر، وسوق البخارية، وسوق الجمعة، وسوق وادي السرور، وسوق الخضار، وسوق اليمنية، وسوق الحبوب، وسوق الحلال، وسوق الصاغة، وسوق السعادة، وسوق الأنتيكا، وسوق البناء الحديث. بالنسبة إلى سوق البخارية القديم، الذي نسج خيوط الحكاية لشيخ من بخاري قدم إلى عمان كغيره من التجار فأسس هذا السوق القديم في ساحة شرقي المسجد الحسيني الحالي عام 1934 وبقي السوق في موقعه إلى عام 1954 وبعدها نقل إلى عمارة فوزي المفتي في شارع الملك طلال مقابل المسجد الحسيني تتوزع عشرات المحلات التجارية حسب نوعية البضائع التي يبيعها السوق. ويمكن تصنيفها إلى محال لبيع أدوات ومستلزمات الحلاقين، وأدوات ومستلزمات الخياطة والتطريز، ومستلزمات مشاغل الخياطة والكلف، وهناك محال لبيع الإكسسوارات والمنسوجات والعطارة، ومحال لبيع العطور والبخورات.\nوعلى الرغم من هذا التنوع التجاري لواقع العاصمة عمان بين الأسواق القديمة والمولات الحديثة والتي تختلف في الشكل والمحتوى تبقى ظاهرة انتشار البسطات بمختلف أنواعها ومحتوياتها موجودة في شوارع الأسواق داخل عمان.\nومن أكبر مراكز التسوق الحديثة في المدينة، ستي مول، مكة مول، تاج مول، عمّان مول، غاليريا مول.\n\nالصناعة\nاتبعت أمانة عمان الكبرى بالتعاون مع وزارة الصناعة والتجارة المعايير في تحديد المناطق الصناعية. وعليه قامت أمانة عمان الكبرى بإجراء دراسة مكثفة وتحليل لخيارات المواقع الملائمة لتأهيلها لتكون المناطق الصناعية كالتالي:\n\nمنطقة سحاب – وممر الموقر: تمّ تصنيف هذه المنطقة كمنطقة صناعات خفيفة ومتوسطة مع الأخذ بعين الاعتبار الصناعات القائمة حاليا في هذه المنطقة وتوفير بعد جغرافي عن المناطق السكنية في منطقة الموقر والنقيرة.\nمنطقة القسطل الصناعية: مع الأخذ بعين الاعتبار الوضع الصناعي الحالي في منطقة القسطل يأتي تحديد هذه المنطقة جنوب شرق طريق المطار حيث تم تصنيف هذه المنطقة للصناعات المتخصصة كصناعات الأبحاث والأعمال والتقنيات. أما بقية الأراضي في هذه المنطقة فقد تم تصنيفها صناعات خفيفة ومتوسطة لتكون مساندة للصناعات المتخصصة في نفس المنطقة وأيضا تسمح هذه المنطقة بتوفير مناطق جغرافية واسعة للمد الصناعي.\nمنطقة الجيزة الصناعية: تمّ تحديد المنطقة جنوبي الجيزة كمنطقة صناعات متوسطة وخفيفة مع الأخذ بعين الاعتبار الصناعات القائمة حاليا في تلك المنطقة. حيث ستكون هذه المنطقة منطقة جذب للعمالة بسبب المشاريع السكنية التي ستقام بالقرب منها، كمشروع تعمير للإسكان.\nهذا وتوجد عدة مناطق صناعية، تحوي على عدد من الوكالات وكثير من محلات تصليح السيارات، متوزعة على أطراف العاصمة، كما في البيادر إلى الجنوب الغربي، وصافوط إلى الشمال الغربي، وماركا إلى الشمال الشرقي، ووادي الرمم إلى الشرق، والوحدات إلى الجنوب من المدينة.\n\nالزراعة\nاشتهرت مدينة عمان بانتمائها إلى منطقة خصبة وافرة الغلال، فقد وصفتها المصادر القديمة ومنها التوراة بكثرة المياه «مدينة المياه»، كما أن الجغرافيين والمؤرخين العرب نعتوا منطقة عمان بالخصب والنماء وكثرة الغلات. ومما اشتهرت به عمان: الحبوب الكثيرة خصوصاً القمح، فوصفت بأنها معدن الحبوب، حتى ضرب المثل بجودة حنطتها، وقد رأينا أنها والصلت كانت تزود القدس وبعض المدن الفلسطينية بالقمح بعدما حررها صلاح الدين من الصليبيين، فاشترط صلاح الدين على أخيه - التي كانت ضمن أقطاعه بأن يرسل القمح ففعل.\nواشتهرت عمان أيضا بالخراف الجيدة السمينة والعسل اللذيذ وانتشرت حولها كروم الأعناب العديد التي استخرجوا منها الخمور وعملوا منها الزبيب، وكذلك أشجار التين الكثيرة ومنها عملوا القطين، التين المجفف، كما اشتهرت بالفواكه الكثيرة وأشجار البطم وغيره.\nوقد وصفت منطقة البلقاء في العصور الوسطى بأنها ذات قرى ومزارع وارضها زكية طيبة حتى إن قراها بلغت نيفاً وثلاثمائة قرية، أما مزارعها فهي واسعة منتشرة نذكر منها مزرعة لأبي سفيان زعيم قريش، وأخرى ليوسف بن عمرو والي العراق. كذلك اشتهرت جادية إحدى قرى البلقاء بزراعة الزعفران - الورس- وكانت له أهميته إذ ذاك لاستعماله في الصباغة وصدر للخارج لان الأوروبيين كانوا يستعملونه كدواء أيضاً. كما صدرت عمان نبات الرواند، وهو عبارة عن عروق خشبية مستديرة في غلظ الأصابع وسمي الروابد الشامي أو رواند الدواب لان البياطرة يسقونه للدواب إذا احترت اكبادها. وهو غير الرواند الصيني الذي يشبه القلقاس ويستعمل في علاج الإنسان، كاوجاع الكبد والكلى والمغص.\nأما نهرها الصغير الذي ذكره الجغرافيون، فقد اقيمت عليه في العصور المختلفة الحمامات لخدمة سكانها، وفي خارجها أقيمت عليه الارحية لطحن الدقيق وكانت هذه الرحية تخدم سكان القرى المجاورة فيقصدون عمان من اجل طحن دقيقهم هذا بالإضافة إلى الزراعات والخضر المختلفة التي تقوم على ضفافه لخدمة سكان المدينة العريقة.\n\nالسياحة\nتشهد عمّان في فصل الصيف ازديادًا كبيرًا في عدد السيّاح، وخصوصًا من الدول العربية. حيث يساعد المناخ المتوسطي المعتدل في جذب هذه الفئة، بالإضافة إلى إقامة العديد من المهرجانات الثقافية والنشاطات الفنية المختلفة. ويوجد عدد لابأس به من الأماكن لزيارتها في المدينة كالمناطق السياحية والمصايف وأماكن الترفيه، بالإضافة إلى المواقع التاريخية الهامة التي تحكي قصة المدينة، وأهمها المدرج الروماني وقلعة عمّان ورجم الملفوف العمّوني. كما تحوي المدينة الكثير من المطاعم والمقاهي التي تقدم الأطعمة الشرقية والغربية خاصة تلك التي تقع في أطراف العاصمة وخارجها وسط الغابات والأشجار الحرجية كجبال عجلون ودبين ومرتفعات الرمان وتحتوي معظم هذه المطاعم والمتنزهات على ملاعب للأطفال أو برك للسباحة مما يجعلها متعة حقيقية لجميع أفراد الأسرة. وتنتشر في عمان والمدن الأردنية الأخرى أسواق الحرف والصناعة التقليدية من المنسوجات والمطرزات والأزياء والحلي والمجوهرات والخزفيات والزجاج كما تتوفر مراكز التسوق الكبيرة التي تحتوي على المحلات التجارية المتعددة وتعرض الملابس الحديثة لدور الأزياء العالمية.\n\nيقع في عمّان الكثير من النوادي الرياضية المتخصصة كنوادي ركوب الخيل والسباحة والنوادي الصحية التي يستطيع الزائر قضاء وقت مفيد وممتع فيها كما تقام أثناء فصل الصيف نواد صيفية متعددة الغايات المغامرات والغطس والسباحة والكمبيوتر يشارك فيها الأطفال والشباب العرب الزوار إلى جانب الأردنيين لممارسة رياضاتهم المختلفة. كما تنتشر المدن الترويحية والمتنزهات والحدائق العامة وصالات ألعاب تسلية الأطفال.\nمن أهم المناطق التي يرتادها السياح، مناطق شارع الثقافة وعبدون وشارع الوكالات وسوق الصويفية وسوق الرابية وشارع مكة وشارع المدينة المنورة وشارع الجامعة الأردنية وسوق جبل اللويبدة وشارع الرينبو وسوق جبل الحسين وسوق أم أذينة، ومناطق وسط البلد بطبيعة الحال. وتحوي هذه المناطق على جملة من المطاعم والمقاهي المتنوعة ذات الطابع الشرقي والغربي، فبالإضافة للمطاعم الأردنية، يمكن للسائح أن يرى العديد من المطاعم اللبنانية والإيطالية والفرنسية والتركية والصينية والهندية ومطاعم الوجبات السريعة الأمريكية ومطاعم عراقية ويمنية وخليجية أخرى.\nشهدت عمّان في 9 تشرين الثاني/ نوفمبر 2005 فيما يعرف شعبيًا بيوم «الأربعاء الأسود» الذي مثّل ضربة عنيفة للسياحة في المدينة والبلاد بشكل عام، حيث أدت عدة عمليات انتحارية إرهابية إلى تفجير بتفجير ثلاثة من فنادقها، قُتل فيها ثلاثة من المهاجمين وألقي القبض على الرابع وهي سيدة. أودت الانفجارات بحياة 65 من المدنيين، ومنهم المخرج السوري مصطفى العقاد وابنته، وإصابة الكثيرين بجروج، مما أثر إلى حد كبير على سكانها ووفود السياح إليها ولكنها بتشديد الأمن واتخاذ الإجراءات المناسبة سرعان ما استعادت وضعها السابق حيث أخذت تستقبل الزائرين طوال العام وخاصة في فصل الصيف عند عودة المغتربين وزيارة السائحين والمصطافين وزيادة الفعاليات الترفيهية والثقافية كمهرجان جرش سابقا ومهرجان الأردن حاليا ومهرجان صيف عمان.\n\nالفنادق\nيوجد في عمّان ما لا يقل عن 36 فندق من فئة الأربعة والخمسة نجوم معظمها أنشئ في عمان الغربية، والعديد منها يتبع سلسلة فنادق عالمية مثل فندق إنتركونتيننتال الأردن والفور سيزنز والميريديان والغراند حياة والراديسون ساس والشيراتون. ويتميز فندق الرويال في عمّان بعمارته الفريدة، إذ يظهر في أفق المدينة وكأنه قلعة تعلو جبل عمان.\n\nالمعالم الأثرية\nوتتمتع عمّان بثروة من المعالم الأثرية الشهيرة ما زالت شاهدة على حضارات قديمة استوطنت المدينة، فعلى جبل القلعة الذي يعلو المدينة القديمة يرتفع «هيكل هرقل» الذي بناه الرومان في القرن الثاني الميلادي على بقايا معبد عموني قديم، إلى جانب متحف الآثار الذي يحتوي على معروضات عديدة من مختلف الحضارات وأدوات تمثل حياة الإنسان في هذه العهود القديمة. وفي وسط المدينة يقع سبيل الحوريات، وعلى مقربة من السبيل ينتصب المدرج الروماني الكبير الذي يتسع لخمسة آلاف متفرج، وغيرها من المعالم التي تُستغل حتى اليوم في فعاليات ثقافية وفنية عديدة، وهي من المراكز التي يستغلها مهرجان الأردن وينظم فيها فعالياته:\n\nمنتزهات وأماكن ترفيهية ورياضية\nرُوعي في التخطيط المدني للمدينة تنوّع الأماكن الترفيهية في نوعيتها وأماكن وجودها، وهناك محاولات حثيثة لزيادتها. ومعظم الجديد منها ينشأ على أطراف المدينة على جانبي الطريق الدائري لتسهيل الوصول إليها.\n\nالسياحة الطبية\nتصل عوائد السياحة الطبية إلى 700 مليون دولار أمريكي في العام، حسب تصريحات البنك الدولي فالأردن هي الأولى في المنطقة والخامسة على مستوى العالم في هذا المجال. هناك عدد من المستشفيات الحكومية والخاصة في عمّان، التي يرتادها المرضى العرب من دول الخليج العربي والعراق واليمن ودول المغرب العربي. وأن ما يجذب المرضى هو إجراءات تخفيض الأسعار والجودة العالية عن العلاج في أوروبا والولايات المتحدة الأمريكية. والساحة الطبية في عمّان تتميز بمهارة وخبرة متميزة في مجال أمراض وجراحة القلب وكذلك تطبيق الكثير من الجراحات الدقيقة فيما يخص العيون والكلى والرئتين.\n\nالصحة\nالمستشفيات\nشهدت عمّان مع تأسيس إمارة شرق الأردن في بداية العشرينات من القرن العشرين، نهضة طبية تمثلت بتأسيس عدد من المستشفيات الحكومية، التي كان أولها مستشفى البلدية ثم المستشفى الحكومي عام 1926. ثم تلى تلك الفترة تأسيس المستشفيات الخاصة، كان أولها مستشفى ملحس في جبل عمّان، وتحديًدا عام 1944. وظلت عمّان تطور من بنيتها التحتية الطبية خلال العقود اللاحقة، حيث تم تشييد مدينة الحسين الطبية عام 1973، والتي تُعد أول مدينة طبية عربية.\nكما شهدت الخدمات الصحية في فترة التسعينات، توسعًا كميًا ونوعيًا على كافة الأصعدة والقطاعات الطبية العاملة في هذا المجال الحكومي منه والقطاع الخاص. فقد شهد القطاع الخاص بعد عام 1990 نموًا مضطردًا في عدد المستشفيات كان أهمها المستشفى التخصصي ومستشفى الأردن ومستشفى الاستقلال ومستشفى الإسراء ومستشفى الأمير حمزة، وغيرها الكثير من المستشفيات التي حصلت على الاعتمادية الدولية من منظمة الصحة العالمية.\nغير أن أهم تلك الإنجازات تمثل بتشييد مركز عالمي متخصص بمعالجة مرض السرطان، هو مركز الحسين للسرطان، الذي تم تأسيسه عام 1997، ليكون أول مركز متخصص في علاج السرطان يحصل على الاعتماد الخاص بأمراض السرطان خارج الولايات المتحدة الاميركية.\n\nالجدول التالي يظهر أهم المستشفيات الموجودة في عمّان:\n\nالتعليم والتعليم العالي\nتعود بدايات التعليم في مدينة عمّان إلى فترة الحرب العالمية الأولى، وتحديدا عام 1916، عند افتتاح مدرسة دار النجاح، والتي كان موقعها خلف المسجد الحسيني الكبير، كان التعليم في المدرسة باللغة التركية ما عدا درس الدين الذي كان يدرس باللغة العربية، وكان يطلق على المدرسة اسم آخر أكثر استعمالا وشيوعا وهو «المكتب الحربي» لأن الخريجين كانوا يتأهلون للالتحاق بالكلية الحربية في الآستانية - إسطنبول.\nشهدت المدينة خلال حقبة الخمسينات والستينات من القرن الفائت طفرة نوعية في مجال التعليم ومن ثم التعليم العالي، بتأسيس الجامعة الأردنية. كما أن هذه الطفرة قد زادت بشكل ملحوظ في عقدي الثمانينات والتسعينات، وقد شهد قطاع التعليم الخاص ازدهارا ملحوظا حيث كانت عمّان هي السباقة فيه في منطقة الشرق الأوسط.\n\nكليات ومدارس\nفي يوليو / تموز 2003، أطلقت الحكومة الأردنية برنامجا طموحا في منطقة الشرق الأوسط وشمال أفريقيا كلها، وهو برنامج إصلاح التعليم من أجل الاقتصاد القائم على المعرفة وهو برنامج متعدد المانحين مدته عشر سنوات، وقدم البنك الدولي لهذا البرنامج 120 مليون دولار أمريكي. وسعى البرنامج إلى إعادة توجيه السياسات والبرامج التعليمية بما يتماشى مع حاجات اقتصاد قائم على المعرفة، وتحسين بيئة التعليم المادية في معظم المدارس، وتشجيع التعليم في سنوات الطفولة المبكرة. وامتدت المرحلة الأولى للبرنامج من 2003 إلى 2009 واختتمت في يونيو/حزيران 2009.\nوالمدارس في عمّان إما عامة أو خاصة. ويخدم قطاع التعليم الخاص أكثر من 31.14 في المائة من الطلبة في عمان. ولا يزال هذا القطاع يتحمل ضرائب باهظة تصل إلى 25 في المائة، مع أنه يتحمل عبئا كبيرا عن كاهل حكومة المملكة، الأمر الذي يجعل الرسوم الدراسية مرتفعة نسبيا، إذ تبدأ من 1000 دولار وتصل إلى 7000 دولار، وتعتبر قيمة رسوم التعليم الخاص مرتفعة للغاية عند مقارنتها بدخل الأسر في المتوسط.\nمن أشهر مدارس المدينة؛ الكلية العلمية الإسلامية، مدارس المطران، مدرسة الفرير، مدرسة راهبات الوردية، كلية الحسين، مدرسة راهبات الناصرة، المدارس العمرية، مدرسة اليوبيل، مدرسة البطريركية اللاتينية وغيرها الكثير.\nيشار بالذكر إلى أنه مبادرة التعليم في الأردن قد حصلت في الآونة الأخيرة على جائزة اليونسكو لاستخدام تكنولوجيا المعلومات والاتصالات في التعليم. ويستند هذا المشروع التعليمي الرائد في مدارس الأردن على الاستفادة من قوة المعلومات والتكنولوجيا من خلال طرق تدريس مجربة لتغيير بيئة التعلم في المدارس.\nبالإضافة إلى ذلك توجد العديد من الكليّات الخاصة والمعاهد التي تمنح شهادات الدبلوم في معظم التخصصات:\nمثل كلية القدس، الأكاديمية العربية للعلوم المالية والمصرفية، كلية طلال أبوغزاله لإدارة الأعمال، الكلية الجامعية المتوسطة والأكاديمية الملكية للطيران وكليات أخرى.\n\nجامعات\nبالنسبة للتعليم العالي، أو الجامعي، فتشمل عمّان عدد كبير من الجامعات قياسا لعدد السكان بالمدينة سواء على المستوى الخاص أو الحكومي، مثل الجامعة الأردنية، جامعة العلوم التطبيقية، جامعة البتراء، الجامعة الألمانية الأردنية، جامعة الأميرة سمية للتكنولوجيا، جامعة الزيتونة، جامعة الإسراء، جامعة العلوم الإسلامية العالمية، جامعة الشرق الأوسط، بعض كليات جامعة البلقاء التطبيقية، وجامعات أخرى.\nيُقبل الحائزين على شهادة الثانوية العامة في الجامعات الحكومية أو الخاصة أو الكليّات. تطبق معظم الجامعات في عمّان والأردن بشكل عام النموذج الأمريكي الجامعي القائم على نظام الساعات (بالإنجليزية: Credit Hours) الذي يمنح الطلبة المرونة لاختيار عدد الساعات وأوقات الدوام الصباحي أو المسائي. هنالك جامعتان حكوميتان مرتبطة بجامعات في الولايات المتحدة والمملكة المتحدة. هنالك أيضا أكثر من 5 جامعات خاصة مُعترف بها على مستوى الدول العربية، وبعض الجامعات الأجنبية كجامعة نيويورك والجامعة الألمانية الأردنية. تستقطب الجامعات الأردنية في عمّان وغيرها من المدن الأردنية كل عام عدد كبير من الطلبة الاجانب العرب وغير العرب.\n\nالبحث العلمي\nلدى الأردن أكبر عدد من الباحثين في مجال البحوث والتطوير لكل مليون شخص بين كل البلدان السبعة والخمسين الأعضاء في منظمة التعاون الإسلامي (OIC) وهو من أعلى المعدلات في العالم حيث يوجد في الأردن 8060 باحث لكل مليون شخص، بينما المتوسط العالمي يبلغ 2532، والمتوسط في الاتحاد الأوروبي يبلغ 6494، في حين أن المتوسط في البلدان الأعضاء في منظمة التعاون الإسلامي يبلغ 649 باحث لكل مليون شخص.\nوتحوي عمّان على كثير من المراكز العريقة في مجال البحث العلمي بجميع فروعه، ومن أهم تلك المراكز؛ الجمعية العلمية الملكية (المؤسسة عام 1970)، التي تهدف إلى تطوير التعاون العلمي والتكنولوجي مع مؤسسات مماثلة في جميع أنحاء العالم.\nكذلك بالنسبة للمركز الجغرافي الملكي الأردني، حيث يعتبر هذا المركز (المؤسس عام 1975) من المراكز المتقدمة على الصعيدين الإقليمي والدولي في مجال العلوم المساحية وإنتاج الخرائط والدراسات والأبحاث التطبيقية المستندة إلى معطيات الصور الفضائية والجوية. عمل المركز منذ إنشائه على توفير الكفاءات المدربة في مجال المساحة والخرائط وما يتعلق بهما من علوم كالاستشعار عن بعد والخرائط الرقمية والجيوديزيا الفضائية، وتم ذلك من خلال التأهيل خارج المملكة في الدول المتقدمة، وداخل المملكة في كلية المركز الجغرافي الملكي الأردني للعلوم المساحية، والتي لم يقتصر التدريب فيها على الأردنيين، بل شمل العديد من أبناء الدول العربية الأخرى.\nكما أن هناك كثير من الجمعيات والمراكز الأخرى المهتمة بمجالات مختلفة، منها الطب والطاقة والهندسة والفنون وغيرها.\n\nالرياضة\nتعد عمّان من أكثر المدن العربية في آسيا اهتماما بالشباب والرياضة بشكل عام، ويتجلى ذلك في عدد المجمعات والمدن الرياضية المخصصة للشباب، مما أثر إيجابا على مشاركات الأردن في بطولات عربية وإقليمية ودولية كثيرة وخاصة على مستوى كرة القدم وكرة السلة، اللتان تلقيا إقبالا واهتماما كبيرا من قبل الشباب الأردني. كذلك ألعاب الدفاع عن النفس والسباحة وكرة التنس واليد والفروسية كلها ألعاب يقبل عليها الشباب في هذه المدينة بشغف. كما ساهم المجلس الأعلى للشباب بتنمية قدرات الشباب من جميع النواحي الحياتيه عن طريق نشر مراكز الشباب في مختلف محافظات المملكة.\nمن أكثر الأندية شعبية بين الجمهور العمّاني على مستوى كرة القدم، هي أندية الوحدات (يتخد من ستاد القويسمة الدولي في الوحدات مقرا له) والفيصلي (يتخد من ستاد عمان الدولي مقرا له) بالإضافة إلى أندية أخرى مثل نادي البقعة. كما يلقى نادي زين والنادي الأرثوذكسي ونادي التطبيقية ونادي الأرينا... إلخ اهتماما كبير من قبل الجمهور ومشجعي كرة السلة الأردنية.\n\nالمدينة الرياضية\nكان هناك استشعار للقيادة الأردنية منذ منتصف الستينات في القرن الفائت، بحاجة الشباب الأردني لإنشاء مركز ريادي يخدم الشباب في كافة المجالات لإبراز قدراتهم وإبداعاتهم ومواكبة التقدم والتطور مما يعكس صورة مشرقة عن الأردن وشعبه، فتبلورت فكرة إنشاء مدينة للشباب التي أصبحت رائدة المدن الرياضية في الشرق الأوسط. تقع المدينة الرياضية أو مدينة الحسين للشباب في قلب العاصمة عمان، وتمتد على قطعة أرض تبلغ مساحتها حوالي 1200 دونم تغطي الأشجار ثلث مساحتها، بينما تحتل المنشآت الرياضية والملاعب والحدائق العامة والمواقف باقي مساحتها. تم البدء بإنشاء المدينة عام 1964 واستغرق ذلك حوالي أربع سنوات.\n\nمشاكل\nالغلاء\nتعاني مدينة عمّان من الارتفاع المستمر في الأسعار، إذ تصدرت أغلى مدن الشرق الأوسط وشمال أفريقيا من ناحية التكلفة المعيشية وفقًا لمجلة الإيكونومست البريطانية ـ في عاميّ 2007 و 2015. وأشار التقرير إلى أن العاصمة الأردنية تقدمت أربع مراتب في لائحة المدن الأغلى بالكلفة المعيشية لتحتل المرتبة الـ48 عالميًا للعام 2015، من المرتبة 52 للعام 2014، لتصبح بذلك ضمن قائمة أغلى خمسين مدينة على مستوى العالم، من بين 133 مدينة شملها التقرير.\n\nالعشوائيات\nأدّت الزيادة غير المتوقعة في عدد السكان في المدينة نتيجة الحروب المتلاحقة في المنطقة، إلى عدم تبنّي المخطط الشمولي الذي تم وضعه عام 1956، والذي يُعتبر أول مخطط هيكلي لعمّان بمعناه الصحيح، والذي حدد شكل المدينة ووظائفها والاستعمالات المختلفة وخطوط النقل والمواصلات وغيرها من الخصائص العامة. تعاني معظم أحياء مدينة عمّان اليوم من النمو العشوائي حتى في الأحياء الراقية، بالرغم من تصنيفها إلى مناطق أ، ب، ج،... إلخ بناءً على عوامل عمرانية وتنظيمية خاصة بقوانين أمانة عمان الكبرى. حيث أن تقسيمات الكثير من قطع الأراضي عشوائية ومتداخلة. كذلك ينتشر عدد ليس بقليل من الإسكانات بشكل غير مدروس، حيث أنها تتمدد باتجاهات غير منظمة مما يؤدي إلى عشوائية في الخدمات حيث يسكن السكان. بالإضافة إلى ضئالة المناطق الخضراء بالنسبة للمباني، وما تبقّى منها يتآكل بسرعة لتحل محله الإسكانات. أما الحدائق العامة فهي محدودة للغاية.\nعلى الرغم من ذلك، قد بدأت عمّان مؤخرًا بالتوسع بشكل مدروس لم تشهده المدينة من قبل، حيث نالت خطة مدينة عمان الشمولية جوائز عالمية، منها جائزة القيادة العالمية في تخطيط المدن وجائزة المدينة عن قارة آسيا لعام 2007.\n\nالأزمة المرورية\nأدت الظروف السياسية المتلاحقة بالمنطقة وتبعاتها المتمثلة بموجات اللجوء من المناطق المجاورة للأردن بشكل كبير وفجائي عبر العقود الماضية، بالإضافة إلى عودة الآف المغتربين في الخارج، إلى ازدياد عدد سكان المدينة بشكل كبير وغير مدروس، والذي أثر بدوره على شبكة الطرق المتواضعة أصلاً. حيث تعاني المدينة من انعدام التخطيط المستقبلي لشوارعها التي لم يُراعى في إنشاءها هذا العدد الكبير من المستخدمين. فالطرق في عمّان في معظمها غير قابلة للتوسعة لاستيعاب الكم المتزايد للمركبات، بالإضافة إلى التلكؤ الحكومي في إيجاد حلول جذرية للمشكلة.\nمن جانب آخر، تُعد عمّان من أقل مدن العالم استخدامًا لوسائل النقل العام، حيث لا يستخدم هذه الوسائل سوى 14% (2010) من العدد الإجمالي للسكان في المدينة. وقد أشارت آخر الإحصائيات إلى أن هناك أكثر من مليون سيارة تسير في عمّان، معظمها لنقل شخص واحد. ونتيجة لهذه المشاكل، تحاول الحكومة في إيجاد حلول بديلة عن استخدام المركبات، حيث يُعد مشروع الباص السريع أهمها. فيما أعلنت عن خطط على المدى البعيد تتمثل بإنشاء خطوط للترام أو المترو بموازاة الباص السريع الذي يُعد حل ضروري وآني بسبب الاختناق المروري الذي تعاني منه المدينة، وخصوصًا صيفًا.\n\nسوء توزيع الخدمات\nتعاني عمّان كمعظم المدن العربية بتعدد الأنماط الحياتية والعمرانية بين أحياءها القديمة والحديثة. لكن المختلف في عمّان يرتبط بنشأتها وأصلها القروي وطابعها الريفي. فالجزء الشرقي من المدينة هو الجزء الأقدم والأكثر كثافة بالسكان، يعاني بشكل عام وواضح من سوء توزيع الخدمات وقلة تواجد المؤسسات الحكومية الكبرى، التي تتركز معظمها في الجزء الغربي.\nبالإضافة إلى ذلك، فإن النمط العمراني في عمّان الشرقية يتسم بتراص الأبنية السكنية المبنية على الأغلب من الطوب. بينما الأبراج التي تضم كبرى الشركات والفنادق والمجمعات التجارية باتت تحتل مساحات كبيرة من عمان الغربية التي يتميز البناء فيها بأنه مكسي بالحجر الكلسي.\nولا ينتهي الأمر عند خصائص العمران والمستوى الاجتماعي والمعيشي للسكان، بل يتعداه إلى التخطيط المدني والهندسي، فالشوارع والأرصفة في شرق عمّان بشكل عام ضيقة وقليلة الصيانة بعكس الكثير من شوارع عمّان الغربية. كما أن مستوى النظافة في غرب عمّان يظهر بشكل واضح عند المقارنة مع أحياء المدينة القديمة التي تتكدس الأوساخ على جوانب شوارعها وحاوياتها، بالإضافة إلى مشاكل الصرف الصحي.\nمن جهة أخرى، تعاني معظم أحياء عمّان الشرقية من التهميش الثقافي وندرة في النشاطات الاجتماعية الموجودة في عمّان الغربية. بالإضافة إلى التهميش الاجتماعي، حيث يُلاحظ بشكل كبير أن عمان مقسومة إلى شطرين، يقع الشطر الأول في الناحية الغربية وأغلب سكانه من الأغنياء المُترفين، أما الشطر الثاني فيمتد في الناحية الشرقية من العاصمة وأغلب قاطنيه من الفقراء المحرومين.\nأما بالنسبة إلى التلوث البيئي، فيعاني كل من شرق ووسط عمّان من عدة مصادر للتلوث، أهمها التلوث المائي المتمثل بسيل الزرقاء الذي يمر من منطقة سقف السيل في وسط البلد ومجاري تصريف المياه في ماركا، والتي يندر وجودها في أحياء عمّان الغربية.\n\nمعلومات عامة\nأمناء ورؤساء عمّان\nابتداء منذ تأسيس أول مجلس بلدي للمدينة عام 1909 في

          "summary": "عَمَّان هي عاصمة المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية ومركز محافظة العاصمة. تُعد أكبر مدن المملكة وواحدة من أكبر المدن العربية بالنسبة لعدد السكان، إذ بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2023 حوالي 4.8 مليون نسمة، مما يجعلها أيضًا واحدة من أسرع المدن نموًا بالسكان بالعالم. تقع المدينة في وسط المملكة على دائرة عرض 31 شمالاً وخط طول 35 شرقًا في منطقة تكثر فيها الجبال، فنشأت في الوديان بين الجبال أولاً فضاقت على سكانها، فارتقوا سفوحها واستمروا في الاتساع عبر قممها حتى انتشرت المدينة بأطرافها فوق 20 جبلا.\nتُعتبر عمّان المركز التجاري والإداري للأردن وقلبه الاقتصادي والتعليمي، حيث أصبحت عمّان نقطة استقطاب للكثير من الجاليات العربية لموقعها المتميز ولعمارتها المعاصرة، كما تستقطب عمّان الكثير من السياح سنويًا من أوروبا الغربية وأمريكا الشمالية واليابان وإستراليا ومن الدول العربية المجاورة والقريبة، وكثيرًا من عائلات دول الخليج العربي تحديدًا، إذ تكثر بها المعالم السياحية عمومًا والعلاجية الطبية خصوصاً. كان من نتيجة وقوع عمّان في مثل هذا الموقع الاستراتيجي في بلاد الشام والشرق الأوسط، أن أصبح موقعها يتحكم بالاقتصاد الوطني ويُحرّك 90% من الاستثمار على المستوى الوطني.\nيرجع تاريخ مدينة عمّان إلى الألف السابع قبل الميلاد، وبهذا تُعتبر من ضمن أقدم مدن العالم المأهولة بالسكان إلى يومنا هذا. وعمّان مدينة قديمة أقيمت على أنقاض مدينة عرفت باسم «ربّة عمّون» ثم «فيلادلفيا» ثم «عمّان» اشتقاقاً من «ربة عمّون»، واتخذها العمّونيون عاصمة لهم. وقد أُنشئت المدينة على تلال سبعة، وكانت مركزًا للمنطقة على ما يبدو في ذلك الوقت، وهي إحدى عواصم بلاد الشام الأربع، وهي أيضًا إحدى المدن الشامية القديمة التي أصبحت عاصمةً لإمارة شرق الأردن ومن ثم المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية بعد استقلالها في العام 1946 عن بريطانيا.\nيسكن عمّان الحديثة مجموعة متنوعة من السكان من أصول مختلفة أتوا من مختلف المناطق، منهم من أتى من مدن أردنية قريبة، ومنهم من أتى من فلسطين، ومنهم من القوقاز وسوريا والعراق.\nشهدت أمانة عمان الكبرى مؤخرًا تطورًا كبيرًا، حيث توسعت عمان بشكل لم تشهده المدينة من قبل. ونالت خطة مدينة عمّان الشمولية جوائز عالمية منها جائزة القيادة العالمية في تخطيط المدن وجائزة المدينة عن قارة آسيا لعام 2007. يبلغ عدد المناطق الإدارية في أمانة عمان 22 منطقة مُوزعة جغرافيا تحوي كل منطقة طاقمًا متكاملا من الموظفين، أما من الناحية الإدارية فهناك مجلس أمانة عمان الكبرى الذي يضم 68 عضوا برئاسة أمين العاصمة، والمجلس مقسم بدوره إلى 14 لجنة مختلفة.\nيُشار بالذكر إلى أنه تم اعتماد يوم 2 آذار/ مارس من كل عام يومًا لمدينة عمّان بعد إقرار مجلس الوزراء الأردني قرارًا بذلك في بداية عام 2021، وذلك في إطار الاحتفاء بمرور 100 عام على تأسيس الدولة الأردنيّة.",

Elle est d'ailleurs l'une des plus vieilles villes du monde à être toujours habitée. Avec plus de 4 millions d'habitants en 2016, elle est la plus grande ville de Jordanie, constituant le centre administratif et économique du pays[réf. nécessaire].\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nAmman se trouve dans une zone vallonnée au Nord-Ouest de la Jordanie. La ville était à l'origine bâtie sur sept collines (ce qui lui a valu le surnom de Rome du Moyen-Orient), mais elle s'étend maintenant sur 19 collines (chacune connue sous le nom « jabal » ou montagne). Les principaux quartiers d'Amman tirent leur nom des collines sur les pentes desquelles ils s'adossent.\nLa capitale abrite encore des camps de Palestiniens, créés en 1948 et 1967 en conséquence du Conflit israélo-arabe.\n\nDistricts\nLa municipalité du Grand Amman est constituée de 22 districts :\n\nDémographie\nDepuis 1879, l'évolution démographique de Amman a été :\n\nHistoire\nÀ travers l'histoire, Amman a abrité plusieurs civilisations.\nAu XIIIe siècle av. J.-C., Amman avait pour nom Rabbath Ammon et était la capitale des Ammonites. Elle est ensuite envahie par les Assyriens, suivis par les Perses puis les Grecs. Ptolémée II Philadelphe, le dirigeant lagide d'Égypte, la renomme Philadelphia. La ville fait partie du royaume nabatéen jusqu'en 106 apr. J.-C., où Philadelphia passe sous la domination de l'Empire romain.\n\nEn 324 apr. J.-C., le christianisme devient la religion de l'Empire et Philadelphia le siège d'un évêché pendant le début de l'ère byzantine. Une des églises de cette période existe toujours dans la citadelle.\nPhiladelphia est renommée Amman sous les rois ghassanides, vassaux des Byzantins. Après la conquête musulmane du Levant, elle fleurit sous les Umayyades (capitale : Damas) et les Abbassides (capitale : Bagdad).\nAmman est détruite par plusieurs tremblements de terre et catastrophes naturelles, et reste un petit village et un tas de ruines, dans le pachalik de Damas (1517-1864) puis le vilayet de Syrie (1865-1918), dont le centre administratif local est As-Salt (Saltus).\nEn 1887 arrivent les Circassiens , majoritairement musulmans, qui ont quitté le Caucase à cause de son annexion par les Russes pendant les règnes des tsars Nicolas Ier et Alexandre II (guerre russo-circassienne 1763-1864, nettoyage ethnique des Circassiens) et ont trouvé refuge dans l’Empire ottoman. Une partie d’entre eux s’installe en Jordanie.\nAmman est prise par les Britanniques en septembre 1918 lors de la bataille d'Amman ; elle remplace Salt comme siège administratif. En 1921, Abdallah Ier la choisit comme capitale de son État nouvellement créé, l'émirat de Transjordanie, devenu plus tard le royaume hachémite de Jordanie. Amman reste une petite ville jusqu'en 1948, quand la population augmente considérablement à cause de l'afflux de réfugiés palestiniens venant de ce qui est aujourd'hui Israël. Amman se développa rapidement à partir de 1952 sous le règne de deux rois hachémites, Hussein et Abdallah II.\nLa population de la ville continue d'augmenter à un rythme irrégulier, au fil des différentes immigrations de populations fuyant les guerres ou les territoires occupés (Palestiniens, Syriens, Irakiens, Koweïtiens).\n\nClimat\nAmman a un climat semi-aride avec des hivers doux et pluvieux. Amman est classé Csa selon la classification de Köppen et sa température moyenne annuelle est de 17,5 °C.\nLes précipitations moyennes annuelles sont de 271 mm et il ne pleut pas de juin à septembre. Janvier est le mois où il pleut le plus avec 62 mm.\n\nÉconomie\nCulture\nDepuis 2010, Amman présente son propre Festival de l’Image à l'initiative de l’Institut Français de Jordanie (IFJ), en partenariat avec la Municipalité du Grand Amman, la galerie Darat Al Tasweer. En 2013, les Rencontres d’Arles se joignent aux partenaires.\n\nMédias\nAmman constitue un pôle journalistique important pour les reporters cherchant à couvrir les événements régionaux. De nombreux journaux et chaînes télévisées jordaniennes y sont situées, en particulier la Société radiodiffusion-télévision jordanienne.\nLa ville est également un point d'entrée majeur pour les journalistes arrivant au Moyen-Orient dans le but de diffuser des informations concernant l'Irak ou les Territoires palestiniens par exemple.\n\nTransport\nAmman possède deux aéroports :\n\nl'Aéroport international Reine-Alia (code IATA : AMM • code OACI : OJAI) ;\nl'Aéroport civil d'Amman (code IATA : ADJ • code OACI : OJAM) à vocation régionale.\n\nTourisme\nLe tourisme à Amman se concentre sur les quartiers anciens du centre-ville, qui se trouvent autour du vieux souk (un marché très animé) et de la mosquée du roi Hussein, la plus ancienne de la ville.\nLes constructions sur la colline de la citadelle d'Amman, connue sous le nom Jabal al-Qal'a, datent des époques romaine et byzantine, avec des ajouts ultérieurs des débuts de l'ère de l'Islam. Des fouilles dans les zones nord et est de la citadelle ont mis au jour des restes pouvant remonter à l'âge de bronze. La citadelle abrite aussi le temple d'Hercule qui aurait été construit sous le règne de l'empereur romain Marc-Aurèle.\nDerrière l'emplacement de l'ancien forum se trouve le théâtre romain, le plus grand de Jordanie, avec 6 000 places. Il aurait été construit entre 138 et 161 apr. J.-C. par l'empereur Antonin le Pieux ; il s'adosse au flanc d'une colline et est toujours utilisé pour des spectacles.\nEn 1161, la forteresse a été occupée par les croisés qui lui donnaient le nom d'Ahamant. Elle devient le domaine des Templiers pour quelques années après 1166.\nAmman possède aussi de nombreuses mosquées. Parmi les plus récentes, l'énorme mosquée du roi Abdallah Ier, construite entre 1982 et 1989.

          "content": "## Overview\nAmman (Arabic: عمان ʻammān) is the capital and largest city of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan with a population of about 4 million as of 2020. Amman forms a great base for exploring the country and does, despite popular belief, hold a few items of interest to the traveler. The city is generally well-appointed for the traveller, reasonably well-organized, and the people are very friendly.\nAlthough not seen as much when in the air over Amman, the city holds many surprises for the visitor. Anything can be found in Amman if one asks. Visit Amman's Roman Amphitheatre or stay in a luxurious hotel. Shopping malls are abundant in Jordan. With new construction in Abdali, in a few years the high-end traveller could eat in the most high-end restaurant, stay in a five star hotel or shop in massive malls, all a few metres from one another. Much less is being done to cater to the budget traveller, although urban beautification in the city centre (old town) is cleaning it up and making it more pedestrian-friendly.\nAmman is experiencing a massive (some would say: reckless) change from a quiet sleepy village to a bustling metropolis, some of whose neighbourhoods seem hell-bent on wanting to imitate Dubai. Amman's roads have a reputation of being very steep and narrow in some of the underdeveloped parts of the city but now the city has state of the art highways and paved avenues. The steep terrain and heavy traffic remains challenging for pedestrians and for the rare cyclist. New resorts and hotels dot the city and there are many things for the traveller to see and do. Use Amman as a staging point for travels to nearby cities and settlements in Jordan.\nAmman's ancient roots date its origins to biblical times. Referred to as the City of Seven Hills, the Jordanian capital's cityscape includes a collection of modern-style houses, mosques, souks and ancient historic ruins.\n\n## Understand\nA city built of white stone, Amman's growth has skyrocketed since it was made the capital of Trans-Jordan in the early 1920s, but especially after the 1948 and 1967 wars with Israel when hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees settled there. Another wave arrived after the second Iraq war, with Iraqi refugees forming the majority of newcomers.\nIts history, however, goes back many millennia. The settlement mentioned in the Bible as Rabbath Ammon was the capital of the Ammonites, which later fell to the Assyrians. It was dominated briefly by the Nabataeans before it became a great Roman trade center and was renamed Philadelphia. After the Islamic conquests, Amman became part of the Islamic Empire, until the Ottomans were forced out by the Allies, with the help of the Hashemites, who formed a monarchy that continues to rule until the present.\nToday, West Amman is a lively, modern city. The eastern part of the city, where the majority of Amman's residents live, is predominantly the residential area of the working class and is much older than the west. While possessing few sites, Amman makes a comfortable base from which to explore the northwestern parts of the country.\nAmman is a very diverse city. Palestinian, Iraqi, Circassian, Armenian, and many other ethnic groups reside in Amman. Amman never stops growing.\nDespite the common assertion that most Jordanians understand English, that knowledge is quite limited. Charmingly, the most commonly known English phrase seems to be \"Welcome to Jordan\". The only non-Arabic language used in signposting is English, and you will find \"Tourist Police\" near the major monuments. It never hurts to know a few useful phrases and come prepared with a translation book, or to have the names and addresses of places you are going written in Arabic for use with a taxi driver.\nRemember if you're travelling during the holy month of Ramadan, it is almost impossible to buy food from sunrise to sundown even for tourists. Big shopping malls like City Mall don't let food stores like McDonald's, Sunset and Starbucks sell food during these hours.\n\n## By plane\n31.722535.9933331 Queen Alia International Airport (AMM  IATA). Most travellers to Amman (and to Jordan) will arrive via this airport.Money exchange is available before passport control along with a single ATM (which doesn't take MasterCard); more ATMs are available after customs. This ATM might charge you an additional fee to your regular bank fees (up to 7 JD), so if you have to pay the 40 JD visa fee, you may want to exchange for it before you arrive. At the immigration line you will pay for the visa at the first counter, and then pass through to the second counter to receive the stamp. (Sometimes the visa and Jordan Pass queues may close and redirect you to another queue further down the airport corridors.) Payment by credit card is accepted; however, the credit card machines can be unreliable so you may have to pay in cash.There is only one post office and no postbox in the airport, in arrivals hall of Terminal 1 near the Lost and Found office. If closed, you can put your letters and postcards under the curtain.      (updated May 2023)\nEarly arrival: If you have an early arrival flight and don't want to pay a full-day hotel for just 4 or 5 hr staying there, you can wait in the baggage claim hall at the airport. There are some 50 seats or so available—not too comfortable but acceptable.\nBy bus – The Sariyah Airport Express bus leaves from a marked bus stop on Level 1 (Arrivals) and costs 3.30 JD. It runs from the airport around the clock every hour on the hour, with additional half-hourly departures 08:30–17:30. It is necessary to purchase the ticket from a kiosk outside the airport exit—the kiosk is easily identified after exit but often only takes cash and frequently does not have enough change for larger bills. As of 2025, payment by card seems to work. Note that during night time there is no service to the airport. Additionally, this service may be run by a minibus with extremely limited seating and space for baggage. For most travellers staying in inner Amman, this is a cost effective option to bring you into the city, where you can then call an Uber or Careem for 1–3 JD to your hotel, or leave at the terminus (Northern Station / Tabarbour) and take the BRT (Bus Rapid Transfer) to the Jordan Museum for 0.610 JD. Beware that taxis tend to crowd the bus stops, especially at the final stop, the North Bus Station. These taxis will generally overcharge and very aggressively attempt to sell to you on arrival, including boarding the bus to tell you they are the official taxi service. They are not!\nBy ride hailing – Uber and Careem operate in the city, and while the fare is usually around 15 JD, rides have to be caught upstairs at the departures level. It can be quite expensive and unpredictable to catch an Uber from the city back to the airport. A ride at certain times of day, such as rush hour in the morning, may cost upwards of 25 JD. Furthermore, a driver may accept the fare, take some time to arrive, and then decline the fare upon arrival after realizing that the destination is the airport. Repeatedly searching for a driver could cause a significant delay to your arrival at the airport for your flight.\nBy taxi – Taxi transportation from the airport to Amman should cost around 20 JD. Airport taxi fares are fixed. The fare is only fixed from airport to city: the taxi driver might try to secure a ride from you from the city back to the airport, often with a massive inflated price. It is not hard to get a ride from city to airport for 20 JD. If the driver is trying to charge more, make your stand and say no.\nVery occasionally, regional or charter flights use 31.972535.9913892 Marka Airport (ADJ  IATA).   , centrally located in east Amman a few kilometers beyond the railway station. You may also want to consider arriving and departing Aqaba airport and then continue with an intercity bus—in summer there might be cheap flights there. Also, you may be entitled to a free visa[dead link].\n\n## By bus\nBig, municipal buses serve many parts of Amman. They are used by low-income workers, working-class youth and foreign workers, but are perfectly safe. As of January 2011, the fare was 380 fils. Pay the exact fare (or overpay); bus drivers have no change! You can also load a bus fare cash card with a few JD and swipe the card past a reader as you enter the bus, but places to buy and recharge the card are rare. As of 2025, you can also simply swipe a MasterCard or Visa. Sometimes it doesn't work if you are in a tunnel for instance. In that case, just wait and the bus will reconnect to the internet network when leaving the tunnel, making the payment possible.\nSince a few years, there is a very efficient BRT network (Bus Rapid Transfer) for only 610 fils. With its own roads, it avoid most of the traffic jam. Moreover, it connects the Northern Station to downtown (close to the Jordan Museum), which is very useful if you sleep downtown.\nMost buses are numbered; some display their destination in Arabic only. Bus no. 26 conveniently travels between the old town (Balad) and the 7th Circle along Zahran Street. No. 27 goes from the old town towards the posh Abdoun neighbourhood. No. 43 passes near Shmeisani (as does no. 46) and continues along Mecca Street towards Mecca Mall. Many bus stops are marked by bus shelters, but buses also drop passengers at unmarked spots wherever it is safe to stop. Private minibuses shadow the municipal buses. They do not display route numbers, but a conductor usually shouts out their destination.\n\n## By train\nScheduled services within Jordan and to Damascus have been suspended by Hedjaz Jordan Railway, and they are unlikely to resume. Train excursions run occasionally, as do local services to Zarqa. Neither operate more often than once per week, if at all. Amman's tiny, charming railway station (Mahatta) with its museum is worth a look even if you do not (or cannot) take a train.\n\n## By taxi\nYellow and grey taxis are readily available and can be easily found anywhere in Amman. Hail them in the street as Jordanians do. Taxis for Amman will have a green logo on the driver and passenger doors. The grey ones have an advertisement on top of the car. Resist hailing cabs with another color logo; these cabs are based in other cities and it is illegal for them to pick up fares in Amman. White taxis are shared, and the driver can pick up other fares along the way, which can lead to confusion.\nTaxis in Amman are required by law to use meters and most drivers will reset the meter as soon as a fare is picked up. Most trips within Amman should be under 2 JD, and even a ride from one end of town to the other should not cost more than 5 JD. Taxis are not required to use meters after midnight and drivers often expect double the normal fare for late night trips.\nBeware of drivers offering to give you a short ride \"for free\" as a \"Welcome to Jordan\", especially if you're walking between the Citadel and the Roman Theater; they will then offer to wait for you to take you to your next stop, and will use the \"free\" ride as an excuse not to start the meter. They will then charge you exorbitantly when you arrive at your next stop. Also, be wary of the private cars posing as taxis around the bus stands and stations. They will offer their services asking you to pay as much as you want but later on insist on pocketing more money from you. In case you get one, insist paying the standard price which should not be more than 2–3 JD, anything more is a rip-off.\nThe base rate for the taxi meter is 250 fils, however, some taxis may use old meters which charge 150 fils, it is legitimate for the driver to ask you for 10 extra piasters (100 fils) on top of the quoted meter fare. Make sure though that you note the initial fare as soon as the driver turns the meter on in order not to have the driver ask you for \"the 10 piasters\" when he has a new meter. Drivers are not normally tipped, instead the fare is simply rounded up to the nearest 5 or 10 piasters. Many drivers do not carry much change, so exact change should be given when possible.\nIf a driver is pretending he has no change, it is likely that he just wants to keep it, so that you'll have to pay more. If you mind this, ask the driver to find a nearby shop and get change or get the change yourself from a shop or (if you don't mind being rude) look into their money box to find the change yourself.\nThe going, negotiated rate for a taxi from Amman to the airport is 20 JD or more, although some drivers can be talked down to 15 JD or even 10 JD (which would be close to the metered rate). All taxis are allowed to take passengers to the airport; only special Airport Taxis may take passengers from the airport into town.\nIf you are visiting the Citadel, call it al'Aqal. The driver may try to convince you that the Roman theater is nicer so that he can drop you off there at the bottom of the hill. It's best to be dropped off at the Citadel and walk down the hill to the Roman theater.\nUber and Careem operate in Amman in the same way as anywhere elsewhere. It is best to select the Uber option as opposed to taxi, and card payment as opposed to cash to avoid being asked for more money by the driver. Ubers and Careem are quite cheap, and in most of the core of the city will cost just 1–4 JD depending on distance and demand. Consider tipping if you can, especially since both apps tend to price on distance—given the difficult streets in Amman, it can often mean much longer actual routes than it may seem on a map.\n\n## On foot\nSome areas of Amman are not easily navigated on foot. Be aware when walking through areas of Amman that are not familiar to you because the walkable route might be inconvenient. Unlike other cities frequented by tourists, tools such as Google Maps may not provide an easily traversable route even when used in walking mode. In this case, a walk that appears to be only a few minutes on Google Maps my take half an hour or longer due to unforeseen obstacles. For example, in some areas of Amman you may encounter roads that quickly become highways/expressways, roads up very steep hills, roads that lack a functional sidewalk, roads that have sidewalks but not functional pedestrian crossings at busy intersections, parts of sidewalks that are heavily obstructed by vegetation, and crossings that require the use of an overpass that is far away. It is not impossible to walk in Amman, but some areas of the city are designed primarily for vehicle traffic and it is better to arrange for a ride.\n\n## By car rental\nThere are several car rental companies located in Jordan some will even give you a driver for free if you book a car rental with them. Some of these are Hertz, Sixt Rental Cars, and National.\n\n## By bicycle\nBike tours are a good way to see the local scenery and meet local cyclists. There are a couple of bicycling tour firms in Amman.\n32.0058435.8550421 Tareef Cycling Club, ☏ +962 797253641 (Montaser), +962 797601625 (Baraa), tareef.cycling.club@hotmail.com.

Even so, the city does hold a few items of historical and cultural interest (allow maximum 2 days to see them).\n\n## In the city\n31.954735.93431 Amman Citadel (جبل القلعة, Jabal al-Qal'a) (If you don't want to go the whole way back to the entrance when getting out, try the southern end of the fence at the very west of the citadel complex).

Visitors desiring a more exotic and traditional experience should explore \"Old Amman\", the central downtown, or 31.95018135.9346153 Balad, which features many souqs, shops, and street vendors. Also known as the Souq with traditional sights and smells of the spice market, and shop for authentic souvenirs.

A maze of streets with everything from a fruit market to spices, souvenirs, clothes, hardware. Drink a cool glass of Sugar Cane juice, watch the talented young men make artistic sand designs inside the glass bottles, go and smoke a shisha (hubbly bubbly) in any of the numerous street cafes. Enjoy some tasty falafel in the famous Hashem cafe, enjoy a mansaf dish at Jerusalem restaurant or a nice slice of tasty Kanafe from Habibeh sweets. Busy crowded streets with the real taste of Jordan.\nAbdali, a section of downtown Amman, is being transformed into a modern center for tourists and natives. The plan includes a broad pedestrian boulevard where visitors can shop, eat, or do numerous other activities. New office buildings and residential hi-rises have been built, and more are on the way.

Those in the western parts of the city will most likely be served by those with a competent grasp of the English language, but you run the risk of the items being a bit overpriced.\nSome interesting, original souvenir items that one may consider taking home are:\na keffiyeh, the traditional checkered headpiece of Jordanian men\nan antique brass tea/coffee pot, distinctly Middle Eastern with its artistic etching and curved spout\nolive wood carvings of various objects or figures can be purchase nearly everywhere\nhand-crafted Jordanian daggers\nhand-made Bedouin-style embroidered clothing\nspices.\nAlso Rainbow Street is populated with small antique stores, clothing, restaurants, sheesha tea shops and the well-known Falafel al-Quds, reputedly the \"best\" falafel in the Middle East (some Saudis even financed the opening of one in Saudi Arabia).

At the end of this street and down some stairs you will find Wild Jordan.\n\n## Eat\nAmman features many different styles of restaurants, from traditional Middle Eastern fare to more familiar Western fast food and franchises. Prices range from ultra-cheap to moderate, depending on one's taste buds. For those on a budget, Arabic food is very affordable and can be obtained everywhere.\nArabic food generally consists of several general basic groups. Meat dishes will generally consist of lamb or chicken; beef is more rare and pork is never offered. Shwarma, which is cooked lamb meat with a special sauce rolled in piece of flat bread, is a local favorite. Rice and flat bread are typical sides to any meal. Jordan's specialty, mansaf, is a delicious lamb and rice meal, typically eaten with your hands. Arabs serve plenty of cucumbers and tomatoes, many times accompanied by a white yoghurt sauce. Another favorite is chick pea-based foods such as falafel, hummus, and fuul.\nOne of Amman's most famous local foods restaurant is Hashem in the downtown. This restaurant is one of the favourites of the Royal family and you will see a lot of photographs of the Royal family of Jordan dining in this literal hole-in-the-wall. See the listing below.\nIn an alley off King Faisal St. is Habibah, which serves traditional east Mediterranean sweets such as baklava, but is most famous for serving a traditional dessert known as knafeh nabelseyyeh in reference to its origin from the Palestinian city of Nablus. 800 fils for a \"half quarter kilo\", which is enough for one person (Oct 2018). The original store is easy to spot with the long queue spilling onto the street: if you're just there for the food rather than the vibe, try the new extension that opened 100 m further up on King Hussein St.\nDo not forget the good surprises coming from the countless shawarma outlets and other very cheap places.\n\n## Budget\n31.95209935.9319891 Cliff Hostel (in one of the alleys in the souq nearby the central post office -- there's a small and old sign).

Drinking age is 18 but some bars and cafes might card you and admit 21+ customers only.\nJordan's national beer is aptly called Petra Beer, and there are many liquor shops and kiosks around Amman where you can find it. There are two types: 'black' and 'red', which have 8% and 10% alcohol percentage respectively. The red is usually slightly more expensive than the black, but you should expect to pay 2-2.5 JD for a 500 ml (18 imp fl oz; 17 US fl oz) can at a shop. You will often find that bars prefer Amstel and other international brands and do not have Petra beer available.\nThe local spirit is arak, an aniseed or licorice flavoured spirit similar to the Greek ouzo. At 50% alcohol by volume, it is usually served with water and ice, causing the clear liquid to become milky white.\nFor night clubs and bars visit the cosmopolitan West Amman where many Western and American franchises operate here.

Jordanian police and the military maintain a tight grip on law and order. Personal safety is high in Amman - it is safe to walk anywhere in the city at any time of day or night. Serious crime is extremely rare. In 2005, some major hotels were targeted by bombers (connected with the conflict in Iraq). Security measures at all major hotels were increased as a result.\nLGBTQ travellers: While laws criminalising homosexuality have long been repealed in Jordan, before even most of the West, Jordanian society at large remains broadly more socially conservative and LGBTQ acceptance is still rather low. No openly or officially gay bars or clubs exist in Amman as of 2023, and LGBTQ travellers are encouraged to exercise discretion.\n\n## Embassies\nMany details can also be found here: https://www.embassypages.com/jordan\nAustralia, Embassy of the Commonwealth of Australia.

This stop serves the airport, Madaba (0.75 JD), Kerak and others. The small yellow \"airport express\" labeled bus is easily recognized and the driver will also stop on other places if you wave at him. To reach the 7th circle from downtown take bus 41 or any headed to Wadi As-Seir and ask to be dropped of at Dawaar As-Saabe'a (7th circle). Many buses going by the 7th circle also take a turn at the 4th circle coming from Trababour Bus Station.\nThe Trababour Bus Station serves all destinations to the north and to the western border. To get there from downtown, take Serviis (a sedan car that works like a bus) #6 from Raghadan Tourist Service Station (Raghadan Al Seyaha) which is located right next to the Colosseum. The Trababour Bus Station is the last stop on the Serviis' route.\nMany budget hotels like Palace or Farah organize day tours for about 16-18 JD which seems a sensible price, but they do not include entrance fees which could be important. These tours are open to people who don't sleep at the hotel. Classical tours are Jerash, Ajlun, Um Qais, Madaba, Mount Nebo, Baptism site, Dead Sea, and Castles.\nMadaba — Just 45 min away and known as the 'City of Mosaics' for its Byzantine and Umayyad mosaics, especially a large Byzantine-era mosaic map of Palestine and the Nile delta at St. George Church. 0.75 JD by bus from the 7th circle.\nJerash (and Ajlun (Ajloun) Castle) — An ancient Roman City. Besides Petra and Wadi Rum, the most famous site in Jordan. 1 h, 0.75 JD from Trababour Bus Station. Get off right before the Hippodrome, 1 km before the bus station, and enter down the side road through the museum. A private taxi from Amman can be hired for 8-10 JD one-way. Expect to pay as much as 40 JD for a return trip and taxi driver staying on site while you look around. Ajlun Castle is only a short side trip from Jerash, either by bus from the junction south of the Hippodrome or by Taxi.\nUmm Qais — A town north, close to the ruins of the ancient Gadara. Best reached by (rental) car or taxi.\nDead Sea — Mt. Nebo (1 JD) and Jesus' Baptism Site (Al-Maghtas) on the Jordan River are essentially on the way, so consider them as well if you have your own car or taxi. The Dead Sea Amman City Resort is about 20 JD with free showers and swimming pools, but no lockers, towels or mud. Taxi services for travel to the Dead Sea can be purchased for the day 20 JD if you hail a cab from downtown, down town hotels charge 35 JD for the same service. There are a handful of bus lines that also run from Amman on a daily basis. Bus from Mujaharin bus station to Rame costs 1 JD. A taxi from Rame to Amman Tourist Beach 4 JD or less. JETT offers a daily shuttle from Amman (7th circle) to the Dead Sea and back for 7 JD oneway.\nPetra — The most famous site in Jordan. JETT buses, both ordinary and all-inclusive guided tour, connect via the fast (but boring) Desert Highway. It leaves at 6:30 from the JETT bus office at Abdali and in 3.5 hr you'll get to the bus station not even 5 minutes from the entrance of Petra. At 17:00 the JETT bus takes off again to go back to Amman. The price is 8-10 JD one way. Time tables of the JETT Bus: http://www.jett.com.jo/SubPage.aspx?PageId=230%5Bdead+link%5D Also, from the South Bus Station Petra can be reached by tourist buses: they tend to leave when they are full, from 08:30 onwards (3½ hr, 4-5 JD). Another option, go via Ma'an (7 JD) into Wadi Musa (0.5 JD) (town of Petra). Furthermore, for 75 JD or less (depending on how much you haggle) you may be able to get a private taxi from Amman to Petra and back, including the driver waiting around for 6 hr.\nWest Bank and Israel — For information on travelling directly from Amman using the Allenby/King Hussein Bridge, see Jordan#King Hussein \"Allenby\" Bridge.\nSyria — There were two operators (one of them called Challenge) each providing two daily services to Damascus (Sumariya-Terminal) from Amman for SYP500 (SYP50 student discount). The tour takes at least 4 to 5 hr, depending on border formalities. However, considering the current situation in Syria, it is not recommended you head into this direction.",

          "content": "Aqaba (English:   AK-ə-bə, US also  AHK-; Arabic: الْعَقَبَة, romanized: al-ʿAqaba, pronounced [ælˈʕæqɑba, ælˈʕæɡæba]) is the only coastal city in Jordan and the largest and most populous city on the Gulf of Aqaba. Situated in southernmost Jordan, Aqaba is the administrative center of the Aqaba Governorate. The city had a population of 148,398 in 2015 and a land area of 375 square kilometres (144.8 sq mi). Aqaba has significant trade and tourism. The Port of Aqaba also serves other countries in the region.\nAqaba's strategic location at the northeastern tip of the Red Sea between the continents of Asia and Africa has made its port important for thousands of years. The ancient city was called Elath, known in Latin as Aela) and in Arabic as Ayla. Its strategic location and proximity to copper mines made it a regional hub for copper production and trade in the Chalcolithic period.\nAela became a bishopric under Byzantine rule and later became a Latin Catholic titular see after Islamic conquest around AD 650, when it became known as Ayla; the name Aqaba is late medieval. In the Great Arab Revolt's Battle of Aqaba Arab forces defeated the Ottoman defenders.\nAqaba's location next to Wadi Rum and Petra has made it one of the major tourist attractions in Jordan. The city is administered by the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, which has turned Aqaba into a low-tax, duty-free city, attracting several mega projects like Ayla Oasis, Saraya Aqaba, Marsa Zayed and expansion of the Port of Aqaba. They are expected to turn the city into a major tourism hub in the region. However, industrial and commercial activities remain important, due to the strategic location of the city as the country's only seaport. The city sits right across the border from Eilat, likewise Israel's only port on the Red Sea. After the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, there were plans and hopes of establishing a trans-border tourism and economic area, but few of those plans have come to fruition.\n\nName\nIn antiquity, the name of the city was Elath or Ailath. The name is presumably derived from the Semitic name of a tree in the genus Pistacia. Modern Eilat (established 1947), situated about 5 km north-west of Aqaba, also takes its name from the ancient settlement. In the Hellenistic period, it was renamed Berenice (Ancient Greek: Βερενίκη Bereníkē), but the original name survived, and under Roman rule was re-introduced in the forms Aila, Aela or Haila, adopted in Byzantine Greek as Αἴλα Aíla and in Arabic as Ayla (آيلا). The crusaders called the city Elyn.\nThe present name comes from the identically-named Gulf of Aqaba, named that as early as 150 A.D. (or somewhat later, if added by a subsequent editor), as evidenced by the plotting of a Mt. Acabe ('Ακάβη όρος) in Ptolemy's Geography, which mountain is shown directly across from the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, on the western coast of the Red Sea, probably somewhere in the vicinity of modern Hurghada, Egypt, and ancient Mons Claudianus, both of which placenames could also themselves be derived cognate forms of the word Aqaba, the former by morphological drift, the latter as a translation into Latin, wherein \"Claudianus\" also suggests limping or stumbling, a perfect semantic overlap for the literal Arabic meaning of \"Aqaba\" (عقبة), as an \"obstacle,\" \"stumbling block,\" or \"spine.\"  Thus the Gulf of Aqaba may've in turn gotten its name from this older region, West of it, around Mt. Acabe (not necessarily a single identifiable mountain), construed as the rough spine of highland that must be crossed, to pass thru the natural trade corridor there, from the Upper Nile to the Red Sea, along modern Egyptian Highway 60.  \nThis name first became mentioned in connection with the city itself of Aqaba, in the 12th century, as ʿaqabat Aylah (عقبة آيلة, 'the mountain-pass of Ayla'), mentioned by Idrisi, at a time when the settlement had been mostly reduced to a military stronghold, properly referring to the pass just to the north-east of the settlement (29.559°N 35.095°E﻿ / 29.559; 35.095, now traversed by the Jordanian Aqaba Highway).\n\nHistory\nNearby Chalcolithic sites\nExcavations at two tells (archaeological mounds) Tall Hujayrat Al-Ghuzlan and Tall Al-Magass, both a few kilometres north of modern-day Aqaba city, revealed inhabited settlements from c. 4000 BC during the Chalcolithic period, with thriving copper production on a large scale. This period is largely unknown due to the absence of written historical sources. University of Jordan \narchaeologists have discovered the sites, where they found a small building whose walls were inscribed with human and animal drawings, suggesting that the building was used as a religious site. The people who inhabited the site had developed an extensive water system in irrigating their crops which were mostly made up of grapes, olives and wheat. Several different-sized clay pots were also found suggesting that copper production was a major industry in the region, the pots being used in melting the copper and reshaping it. Scientific studies performed on-site revealed that it had undergone two earthquakes, with the latter one leaving the site completely destroyed.\n\nEarly history\nElath\nThe Edomites, who ruled over Edom just south of the Dead Sea, are believed to have built the first port in Aqaba called Elath around 1500 BC, turning it into a major hub for the trade of copper as the Phoenicians helped them develop their maritime economy. They profited from its strategic location at the junction of trading routes between Asia and Africa.\n\nTell el-Kheleifeh\nArchaeologists have investigated an Iron Age settlement at Tell el-Kheleifeh, immediately west of Aqaba, inhabited between the 8th and 4th centuries BCE.\n\nUndefined\nAround 735 BC, the city was conquered by the Assyrian empire. Because of the wars the Assyrians were fighting in the east, their trading routes were diverted to the city and the port witnessed relative prosperity. The Babylonians conquered it in 600 BC. During this time, Elath witnessed great economic growth, which is attributed to the business background of its rulers who realized how important the city's location was. The Persian Achaemenid Empire took the city in 539 BC.\n\nClassical antiquity\nHellenistic period\nThe city continued to grow and prosper which made it a major trading hub by the time of the Greek rule by 300 BC, after the Wars of Alexander the Great, it was described by a Greek historian to be \"one of the most important trading cities in the Arab World\". The Ptolemaic Greeks called it Berenice.\nThe Nabatean kingdom had its capital north of the city, at Petra.\n\nRoman period\nIn 64 BC, following the Roman conquest, they annexed the city and called it Aela (also Haila, Aelana, in Greek rendered Αἴλα Aila).\nBoth Petra and Aela were under strong Nabatean influence despite the Roman rule. Aela reached its peak during Roman times, the great long-distance road the Via Traiana Nova led south from Bostra through Amman, terminating in Aela, where it connected with a west road leading to the Paralia and Roman Egypt.\nAround AD 106 Aela was one of the main ports for the Romans.\n\nLate Roman and Byzantine periods\nThe Aqaba Church was constructed under Roman rule between 293 and 303 and is considered to be the oldest known purpose-built Christian church in the world. By the time of Eusebius, Aela became the garrison of the Legio X Fretensis, which was moved to Aela from Jerusalem.\n\nOne of the oldest known texts written in the Arabic alphabet is a late 4th-century inscription found in Jabal Ram 50 kilometres (31 miles) east of Aqaba.\nThe city became a Christian bishopric at an early stage. Its bishop Peter was present at the First Council of Nicaea, the first ecumenical council, in 325. Beryllus was at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and Paul at the synod called by Patriarch Peter of Jerusalem in 536 against Patriarch Anthimus I of Alexandria, a council attended by bishops of the Late Roman provinces of Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda and Palaestina Tertia, to the last-named of which Aela belonged.\nA citadel was also built in the area that became the focal point of the Roman southern defense system.\nIn the 6th century, Procopius of Caesarea mentioned a Jewish population in Eilat and its surroundings which enjoyed autonomy until the time of Justinian I (r. 527–565).\nAccording to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad himself reached Aila during the expedition of Tabuk of 630, and extracted tribute from the city.\nDuring the Late Byzantine or even Early Muslim period, Aila was the origin of what came to be known as the Ayla-Axum amphoras.\n\nEarly Muslim Ayla\nAila fell to the Islamic armies by 629, and the ancient settlement was left to decay, while a new Arab city was established outside its walls under Uthman ibn Affan, known as Ayla (Arabic: آيلا).\nThe Early Muslim city was excavated in 1986 by a team from the University of Chicago. Artefacts are now on exhibit at Aqaba Archaeological Museum and Jordan Archaeological Museum in Amman. The fortified city was inscribed in a rectangle of 170 × 145 meters, with walls 2.6 meters thick and 4.5 meters high, surrounding a fortified structure, occupying an area of 35 × 55 meters. 24 towers defended the city. The city had four gates on all four sides, defining two main lines intersecting at the centre. The intersection of these two thoroughfares was indicated by a tetrapylon (a four-way arch), which was later transformed into a luxury residential building decorated with frescoes dated to the tenth century. This type of urban structure, known as a misr (pl. amsar), is typical of early Islamic fortified settlements.\n\nThe city prospered from 661 to 750 under the Umayyads and beyond under the Abbasids (750–970) and the Fatimids (970–1116). Ayla took advantage of its key position as an important step on the road to India and Arab spices (frankincense, myrrh), between the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian Peninsula. The city is also mentioned in several stories of the Arabian Nights.\nThe geographer Shams Eddin Muqaddasi describes Ayla as nearby the ruined ancient city.\nThe city was mentioned in Medieval Arabic sources as having a mixed population of Jews and Christians. It subsequently became an important station for pilgrim caravans on the way to Mecca.\nThe city was \"completely destroyed\" by the 1068 Near East earthquake.\n\nCrusader/Ayyubid and Mamluk periods\nBaldwin I of Jerusalem took over the city in 1115 without encountering much resistance. The centre of the city then moved to 500 meters along the coast to the south, and the crusader fortress of Elyn was built, which allowed the Kingdom of Jerusalem to dominate all roads between Damascus, Egypt, and Arabia, protecting the Crusader states from the east and allowing for profitable raids on trade caravans passing through the area. In order to secure this strategic position, Baldwin also built and garrisoned a fortress on Pharaoh's Island (called Île de Graye by the Franks), the modern Jazīrat Fir'aun in Egyptian territorial waters about 7 kilometres (4 miles) west of Aqaba.\nThe garrison of Elyn (now serving primarily as a military outpost) was further strengthened in 1142 by Pagan the Butler, Lord of Oultrejourdain, who pursued an ambitious program of castle building throughout his domain. However, there was no large-scale settlement of Europeans in the area, and the region between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba remained mainly inhabited by Bedouins, who were obliged to pay tribute to the Lordship of Oultrejourdain. Despite all efforts to fortify the region, the city was captured in 1170 by a squadron sent by Saladin as he was besieging Gaza; while it was successfully raided by Raynald of Châtillon in 1182, it was never retaken by the Crusaders.\nThe old fort was rebuilt, as Aqaba Fortress, by Mamluk sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh Al-Ghuri in the early 16th century. For the next four centuries, the site was a simple fishing village of little importance.\n\nModern history\nDuring World War I, the Ottoman forces were forced to withdraw from Aqaba in 1917 after the Battle of Aqaba, led by T. E. Lawrence and the Arab forces of Auda Abu Tayi and Sherif Nasir. The capture of Aqaba allowed the British to supply the Arab forces. In 1918, the regions of Aqaba and Ma'an were officially incorporated into the Kingdom of the Hejaz. In 1925, Ibn Saud the ruler of Nejd with the help of his Wahhabi Ikhwan troops successfully annexed the Hejaz, but gave up the Ma'an and Aqaba to the British protectorate of Transjordan.\n\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 8,908 inhabitants in 'Aqaba.\nIn 1965, King Hussein, through an exchange deal with Saudi Arabia, gave 6,000 square kilometres (2,317 square miles) of desert land in Jordanian territories in exchange for other territories, including 12 kilometres (7 miles) of an extension of prime coastline south of Aqaba, which included the Yamanieh coral reef. Aqaba was a major site for imports of Iraqi goods in the 1980s until the Persian Gulf War.\nIn 1997, the Aqaba Marine Reserve was established within the southern boundaries of the Gulf of Aqaba.\n\nGeography\nThe city lies at Jordan's southernmost point, on the Gulf of Aqaba lying at the tip of the Red Sea. Its strategic location is shown in the fact that it is located at the crossroads of the continents of Asia and Africa, while bordering Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\nClimate\nAqaba has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with mild, sometimes warm winters and very hot dry summers. Subzero temperatures can be observed every few years. The record high temperature of 49.6 °C (121.3 °F) was registered on 14 August 2025 . The record low temperature of −3.9 °C (25.0 °F) was on January 16, 2008, as in Eilat.\n\nLocal government\nIn August 2000, the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA) was established which acted as the statutory institution empowered with administrative, fiscal, regulatory and economic responsibilities.\n\nAdministrative divisions\nJordan is divided into 12 administrative divisions, each called a Governorate. Aqaba Governorate divides into 3 Districts, some of which are divided into Subdistricts and further divided into villages.\n\nEconomy\nWith status as Jordan's special economic zone, Aqaba's economy is based on the tourism and port industry sectors.\nAqaba's location next to Wadi Rum and Petra has strengthened the city's location on the world map and made it one of the major tourist attractions in Jordan. The city is administered by the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, which has turned Aqaba into a low-tax, duty-free city, attracting several mega projects like Ayla Oasis, Saraya Aqaba, Marsa Zayed and expansion of the Port of Aqaba. They are expected to turn the city into a major tourism hub in the region. Industrial and commercial activities remain important, due to the strategic location of the city as the country's only seaport.\nAqaba is the only seaport of Jordan so virtually all of Jordan's exports depart from here. Heavy machinery industry is also flourishing in the city with regional assembly plants being located in Aqaba such as the Land Rover Aqaba Assembly Plant. \nBy 2008 the ASEZ had attracted $18bn in committed investments, beating its $6bn target by 2020 by a third and more in less than a decade. The goal was adjusted to bring in another $12bn by 2020, but in 2009 alone, deals worth $14bn were inked. Some projects currently under construction are:\n\nMarsa Zayed a $10 billion is the largest mega mixed-use development project ever envisioned in both Jordan and the region. Marsa Zayed will host facilities including residential neighborhoods, commercial outlets and amenities, entertainment venues, financial and business facilities, and a number of hotels. Additionally, the property will feature marinas and a cruise ship terminal. Marsa Zayed will encompass 6.4 million square meters of built-up property.\nSaraya Aqaba, a $1.5 billion resort with a man made lagoon, luxury hotels, villas, and townhouses that will be completed by 2017.\nAyla Oasis, a $1.5 billion resort around a man made lagoon with hotels, villas, an 18-hole golf course designed by Greg Norman.  It also has an Arabian Venice theme with apartment buildings built along canals only accessible by walkway or boat. This project will be completed by 2017.\nTala Bay, Tala Bay was developed in a distinctive architectural style that blends Jordanian and regional architecture with total cost of US$680 million.  Another distinguishing feature of this single community resort is its two-kilometer private sandy beach on the Red Sea.\nThe Red Sea Astrarium (TRSA), the world's only Star Trek themed park, worth $1.5 billion would have been completed by 2014 but cancelled in 2015.\nPort relocation. Aqaba's current port will be relocated to the southernmost part of the province near the Saudi border. Its capacity will surpass that of the current port.  The project costs $5 billion, and it will be completed by 2013.\nAqaba will be connected by the national rail system which will be completed by 2013.  The rail project will connect Aqaba with all Jordan's main cities and economic centers and several countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Syria.\nThe Aqaba Container Terminal (ACT) handled a record 587,530 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in 2008, an increase of 41.6% on the previous year. To accommodate the rise in trade on the back of the increasing popularity of container shipping and the stabilising political situation in Iraq, the Aqaba Development Corporation (ADC) has announced plans for a new port. The port relocation 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the south will cost an estimated $600m and will improve infrastructure, while freeing up space for development in the city. Plans for upgrading the King Hussein International Airport (KHIA) and the development of a logistics centre will also help position Aqaba as a regional hub for trade and transport.\n\nTourism\nAqaba has a number of luxury hotels, including in the Tala Bay resort 20 km further to the south, which service those who come for fun on the beaches as well as Scuba diving. Aqaba offers more than thirty primary diving locations, with the majority of them accommodating divers of all skill levels. These diving sites comprise fringing reefs that extend for over 25 kilometers, reaching all the way to the border with Saudi Arabia.\nIt also offers activities which take advantage of its desert location.  Its many coffee shops offer mansaf and knafeh, and baqlawa desserts. Another very popular venue is the Turkish Bath (Hamam) built in 306 AD, in which locals and visitors alike come to relax after a hot day.\n\nIn 2006, the Tourism Division of the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority (ASEZA) reported that the number of tourists visiting the Zone in 2006 rose to about 432,000, an increase of 5% over previous year. Approximately 65%, or 293,000 were Jordanians. Of foreign tourists, Europeans visited the Zone in the largest numbers, with about 98,000 visiting during the year. The division has financed tourism advertising and media campaigns with the assistance of the European Union.\nAqaba has been chosen for the site of a new waterfront building project that would rebuild Aqaba with new man-made water structures, new high-rise residential and office buildings, and more tourist services to place Aqaba on the investment map and challenge other centers of waterfront development throughout the region.\nAqaba was chosen as the Arab Tourism City of 2011.\nDuring the 5-day holiday at both the end of Ramadan and Eid Al-Adha, Jordanian and western expats flock into the city with numbers reaching up to 50,000 visitors. During this time the occupancy rate of most hotels there reaches as high as 90%, and are often fully booked.\nThe several development projects (i.e. Ayla, Saraya etc.) now taking place in Aqaba provide \"opportunities of empowerment\" for local populations that want to expand their agency within the city. According to Fulbright scholar Kimberly Cavanagh development projects will help exhibit the ways global- local partnerships and the resultant cultural exchanges,  can result in mutually beneficial outcomes.\n\nDemographics\nThe city of Aqaba has one of the highest population growth rates in Jordan in 2011, and only 44% of the buildings in the city had been built before 1990. A special census for Aqaba city was carried by the Jordanian department of statistics in 2007, the total population of Aqaba by the census of 2007 was 98,400.  The 2011 population estimate is 136,200. The results of the census compared to the national level are indicated as follows:\n\nReligion\nِIslam represents the majority of the population of Aqaba, but Christianity still exists today. Approximately 5,000 Christian families live in the city. There are several churches in the city and multiple Christian schools including Rosary Sisters School Aqaba.\n\nCityscape\nResidential buildings in Aqaba are made up of 4 stories, of which are covered with sandstone or limestone. The city has no high-rises; however, Marsa Zayed project is planned to dramatically change that reality through the construction of several high-rise towers that host hotels, residential units, offices and clinics.\n\nCulture\nMuseums\nThe largest museum in Aqaba is the Aqaba Archaeological Museum.\n\nLifestyle\nAqaba has recently experienced a great growth in its nightlife, especially during the dramatic increase of tourist number in the 2000s.\n\nTransport\nRail\nThe Aqaba railway which transported phosphate to the old port ceased operations in 2018. A successor line to transport phosphate from Al Shidiya and Ghor es-Safi to the new terminal in Port of Aqaba is planned through an agreement between Jordan's Ministry for Transport and Etihad Rail.\nThere has been propositions to connect Eilat to Aqaba by rail.\n\nAirports\nKing Hussein International Airport is the only civilian airport outside of Amman in the country, located to the north of Aqaba. It is a 20-minutes drive away from the city center. Regular flights are scheduled from Amman to Aqaba with an average flying time of 45 minutes which is serviced by Royal Jordanian Airlines and Jordan Aviation Airlines. Several international airlines connect the city to Istanbul, Dubai, Alexandria, Sharm el-Sheikh, and other destinations in Asia and Europe. Since the 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan, there were plans to jointly develop airport infrastructure in the region. However, when Israel built Ramon Airport only 10 km distant from King Hussein International Airport, this happened without consulting the Jordanian side, which caused a slight deterioration of bilateral relations between the two countries and concerns over the safety of having two airports so close together.\n\nRoads\nAqaba is connected by an 8,000 kilometres (5,000 mi) modern highway system to surrounding countries. The city is connected to the rest of Jordan by the Desert Highway and the King's Highway that provides access to the resorts and settlements on the Dead Sea. Aqaba is connected to Eilat in Israel by taxi and bus services passing through the Wadi Araba crossing. And to Haql in Saudi Arabia by the Durra Border Crossing. There are many bus services between Aqaba and Amman and the other major cities in Jordan, JETT and Trust International are the most common lines. These tourist buses are spacious and installed with air conditioning and bathrooms.\n\nPort\nThe Port of Aqaba is the only port in Jordan. Regular ferry routes to Taba are available on a daily basis and are operated by several companies such as Sindbad for Marine Transportation and Arab Bridge Maritime. The routes serve mainly the Egyptian coastal cities on the gulf like Taba and Sharm Al Sheikh. In 2006, the port was ranked as being the \"Best Container Terminal\" in the Middle East by Lloyd's List. The port was chosen for its recent improvements and its ability to handle local traffic as well as international traffic to four neighboring countries.\n\nWildlife\nThe Gulf of Aqaba is rich with marine life. The gulf is home to approximately 500 fish species, with many being permanent residents, like lion fish and octopus, while others are migratory, typically appearing during the summer, such as sailfish, considered the fastest fish in the ocean, as well as the world's largest fish, the whale shark. Marine mammals and reptiles also inhabit the gulf during summer, hawksbill sea turtles, and bottle nosed dolphins call Aqaba's gulf home as well. A large number of predatory shark species used to inhabit Aqaba's gulf but, due to overfishing and pollution, this population is in decline.  While mostly deep water sharks such as the tiger sharks and thresher sharks are present, there are also a small number of reef sharks as well. The world's fastest shark, the short-fin mako shark is the most commonly caught species by fishermen in Aqaba. Whale sharks, locally known as Battan,  are the most commonly sighted. Conservationists are working hard to protect Aqaba's shark population.\nThe gulf of Aqaba hosts more than 390 bird species including migratory birds such as the greater flamingo, great white pelican and the pink-backed pelican.\n\nEducation\nThere is a University of Jordan Aqaba Branch.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nAqaba is twinned with:\n\nGallery\nSee also\nAqaba Special Economic Zone Authority\nDisi Water Conveyance Project\nMidian\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nAqaba Marketing and Tourism Directorate\nPhotos of Aqaba at the American Center of Research\nPhotos of Aqaba / Ayla at the American Center of Research\nAqaba - the Jewel of the Red Sea",
          "summary": "Aqaba (English:   AK-ə-bə, US also  AHK-; Arabic: الْعَقَبَة, romanized: al-ʿAqaba, pronounced [ælˈʕæqɑba, ælˈʕæɡæba]) is the only coastal city in Jordan and the largest and most populous city on the Gulf of Aqaba. Situated in southernmost Jordan, Aqaba is the administrative center of the Aqaba Governorate. The city had a population of 148,398 in 2015 and a land area of 375 square kilometres (144.8 sq mi). Aqaba has significant trade and tourism. The Port of Aqaba also serves other countries in the region.\nAqaba's strategic location at the northeastern tip of the Red Sea between the continents of Asia and Africa has made its port important for thousands of years. The ancient city was called Elath, known in Latin as Aela) and in Arabic as Ayla. Its strategic location and proximity to copper mines made it a regional hub for copper production and trade in the Chalcolithic period.\nAela became a bishopric under Byzantine rule and later became a Latin Catholic titular see after Islamic conquest around AD 650, when it became known as Ayla; the name Aqaba is late medieval. In the Great Arab Revolt's Battle of Aqaba Arab forces defeated the Ottoman defenders.\nAqaba's location next to Wadi Rum and Petra has made it one of the major tourist attractions in Jordan. The city is administered by the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority, which has turned Aqaba into a low-tax, duty-free city, attracting several mega projects like Ayla Oasis, Saraya Aqaba, Marsa Zayed and expansion of the Port of Aqaba. They are expected to turn the city into a major tourism hub in the region. However, industrial and commercial activities remain important, due to the strategic location of the city as the country's only seaport. The city sits right across the border from Eilat, likewise Israel's only port on the Red Sea. After the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, there were plans and hopes of establishing a trans-border tourism and economic area, but few of those plans have come to fruition.",

          "content": "العقبة هي المدينة الساحلية الوحيدة في الأردن، والمدينة الأكبر والأكثر سكانا بين مدن خليج العقبة جميعها. تقع العقبة في أقصى جنوب المملكة الأردنيّة الهاشميّة على ساحل البحر الأحمر، وهي مركز محافظة العقبة. تبعد المدينة حوالي 330 كيلومتر جنوب العاصمة الأردنية عمّان. وقد بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2015 حوالي 148,398 نسمة، حيث تُعد خامس أكبر مدينة في المملكة. وتبلغ مساحة المدينة 375 كيلومتر مربع (144.8 ميل2). وللعقبة دور كبير في الاقتصاد الوطني الأردني وتطويره؛ وذلك من خلال كل من القطاعين التجاري والسياحي. ويُذكر أن ميناء العقبة يعد معبرا بحريا مهما للدول الأخرى المجاورة للأردن كذلك.\nبسبب موقعها الاستراتيجي في أعلى شمال شرقي خليج العقبة المتفرع من البحر الأحمر، والذي يتوسط الطرق التجارية بين قارتي آسيا وإفريقيا؛ كل ذلك جعل من العقبة ومنفذها البحري منطقة مهمة عبر آلاف السنين. بالإضافة لذلك، تتميز مدينة العقبة بأنها منطقة إستراتيجية والمنفذ البحري الوحيد للأردن، كما أنَّ للعقبة حدود برية مع مدينة حقل في المملكة العربية السعودية عبر مركز حدود الدرة، وحدود بحرية مع مصر وأيضا مع مدينة إيلات عبر معبر وادي عربة وكلتا المدينتين تقعا على رأس خليج العقبة المتفرع من البحر الأحمر. وتشتهر العقبة بكونها منطقة جاذبة لهواة الغوص بشواطئها المطلة على البحر الأحمر. وتضم المدينة العديد من المنشآت الصناعية الهامة، والمناطق التجارية الحرة، ومطار الملك حسين الدولي. وتعتبر مركزا إدارياً مهماً في منطقة أقصى جنوب الأردن. ومصدر للفوسفات وبعض أنواع الصدف. ويقدر عدد سكان المدينة بحوالي 150,000 نسمة.\nالاسم القديم للمدينة بحسب التوراة العبرية كان إيلات، وهو الاسم الذي استمر في الحقب اللاحقة الرومانية وفي عهود الخلافة الإسلامية على شكل أيلة، ثم آيلة. وبسبب موقعها موقعها الاستراتيجي وقربها من مناجم النحاس، فقد كانت مركزًا إقليميًا لإنتاج النحاس وتجارته خلال العصر النحاسي. خلال الاحتلال البزنطي للمنطقة، أصبحت العقبة -أيلة آنذاك - أبرشية نصرانية، لتتحول بعد ذلك خلال الحكم العربي الإسلامي لأبرشية فخرية، وذلك عندما صار اسم المدينة آيلة. أما اسم العقبة الحالي فهو ظهر في العهود المتأخرة من القرون الوسطى. وخلال الثورة العربية الكبرى، وقعت في العقبة معركة عرفت تاريخيا باسم معركة العقبة والتي كان لانتصار العرب فيها على الأتراك الأثر الحاسم في جلاء الأتراك عن البلاد العربية.\nموقع مدينة العقبة بالقرب من وادي رم ومدينة البتراء إحدى عجائب الدنيا السبع، جعل منها ومن المواقع المذكور ما يعرف بمثلث الأردن السياحي الذهبي؛ الشيء الذي قوّى من مكانتها السياحية على الخريطة العالمية، كما جعلها واحدة من كبريات الوجهات السياحية الجاذبة في الأردن. تُدار العقبة اقتصاديا وخدماتيا من خلال سلطة منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة، والتي ساهمت بتحويل مدينة العقبة إلى مدينة منخفضة الضرائب وخالية من الرسوم الجمركية، مما جعلها نقطة جاذبة لكبريات المشاريع مثل منتجعات آيلة وسرايا العقبة ومرسى زايد  و هناك ايضاً رفاهيات مثل مهرجان العقبة و فعاليات رياضية مثل سباقات القوارب وغيرها وايضاً  توسعة ميناء العقبة. كل تلك المشاريع من المتوقع منها أن تحول العقبة إلى نقطة جذب سياحية كبرى على مستوى الإقليم. ومع ذلك، تبقى للأنشطة التجارية والصناعية أهميتها الكبيرة؛ وذلك بسبب موقع العقبة وطبيعتها الاستراتيجية، كونها هي المنفذ البحري الوحيد للأردن على العالم.\n\nالتسمية\nقبل اسم العقبة كان يطلق عليها اسم آيلة وتعني في اللغة:\n\n \n  \nأما اسم العقبة فبرز في العصر المملوكي، حيث كانت المدينة تذكر بأيلة أو عقبة أيلة ردحاً طويلاً من الزمن، حتى غلب اسم العقبة عليها في العصر المملوكي.\n\nتاريخ\nمنذ 4000 سنة قبل الميلاد كانت العقبة موطنا للعديد من الشعوب بسبب موقعها الاستراتيجي على البحر وعلى تقاطع الطرق بين آسيا وأفريقيا وأوروبا. كانت أحد أهم مدن النبطيين الذين توسعوا في المنطقة واستوطنوها. وكانت معبراً لطرق التجارة الدولية، تمر منها وتعود من خلالها القوافل القادمة من الحجاز وجنوب الجزيرة العربية متجهين إلى مصر أو بلاد الشام.\nأطلق اليونانيون عليها اسم بيرنايس وأطلق عليها الرومان مسمى إيلا أو إلينا. خلال العهد الروماني كان طريق فيانوفاتريانا يتجه جنوباً من دمشق مارا بعمّان وينتهي في العقبة ومن هناك تتصل بالطريق المتجه غرباً إلى فلسطين ومصر.\nبعد عهد النبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم أصبحت العقبة تحت الحكم الإسلامي ثم تنقلت ملكيتها بين العديد من السلالات الحاكمة مثل الأمويون والعباسيون والفاطميون والمماليك.\nخلال القرن الثاني عشر الميلادي قام الصليبيون باحتلال المنطقة وبنوا فيها قلعة لا تزال محفوظة إلى الآن. وبالإضافة إلى بناء القلعة قاموا بتحصين جزيرة تتبع الآن المياه الإقليمية المصرية وتبعد 7 كم عن العقبة وتسمى جزيرة فرعون.\nفي عام 1170م استعاد صلاح الدين الأيوبي مدينة العقبة وجزيرة فرعون. ثم استولى عليها المماليك في عام 1250م وبنوا فيها حصنا في القرن الرابع عشر في عهد آخر حكامهم وهو قانصوه الغوري.\nمع بداية القرن السادس عشر خضعت المنطقة لنفوذ العثمانيين وفي فترة حكمهم بدأت تفقد العقبة أهميتها فصارت قرية صغيرة تعيش على صيد الأسماك.وتكون العقبة أجمل مدن الأردن\nخلال الحرب العالمية الأولى أجبرت القوات العثمانية على مغادرة القرية على يد القوات العربية بقيادة الشريف الحسين بن علي سنة 1917 ضاما العقبة لمملكته في الحجاز الأمر الذي أدى إلى فتح الأبواب لخطوط الدعم القادمة من مصر إلى القوات البريطانية والعربية في الأردن وفلسطين.\nفي عام 1965م تم الاتفاق بين الأردن والسعودية على أن تأخذ السعودية 6000 كم من الأراضي الصحراوية الداخلية الأردنية مقابل 12 كم على الساحل في المنطقة القريبة من العقبة.\n\nالتركيبة السكانية\nقامت دائرة الإحصاء الأردنية في عام 2007، باجراء عملية تعداد لسكان في مدينة العقبة، بالمقارنة مع الأردن على الصعيد المحلي. وكانت النتائج على النحو الاتي:\n\nالسياحة في العقبة\nتعتبر السياحة في مدينة العقبة نشطة لأسباب متنوعة وانها منطقة ساحلية تقع على البحر الأحمر، كما ان فيها أماكن جميلة يمكن زيارتها، فان العقبة منطقة مليئة بالسياح الذين يأتون للتمتع بالبحر الرائع والجو الجميل فيها.\nوتشتمل العقبة على أهم المشاريع المهتمة في السياحة البيئية في الأردن وهي محطة العقبة لمراقبة الطيور والتي تستقطب عشرات الالف وربما الملايين من الطيور المهاجرة أثناء رحلتها بين أوروبا وأفريقيا خلال موسمي الهجرة في الخريف والربيع، ويتضمن مشروع محطة العقبة لمراقبة الطيور غابه للاشجار الكبيرة وحدائق لأشجار واطنة في المنطقة بالإضافة لمسطحات مائية كبيرة تلعب جميعها بشكل متكامل على استقطاب أنواع مختلفة من الطيور قد يكون بعضها نادر الوجود على مستوى العالم الأمر الذي يدفع العديد من المهتمين بمراقبة الطيور وعلماء الطيور لزيارة المنطقة وعمل التحاليل العلمية والأبحاث الخاصة بعلم الطيور.\nوتعد العقبة بشكل خاص ومنطقة الأردن بشكل عام من المناطق المهمة عالميا لهجرة الطيور بناء على تصنيف Birdlife International.\n\nوتحتضن محطة العلوم البحرية الواقعة على الشاطئ الجنوبي لخليج العقبة معرضا للأحياء البحرية يستطيع الزائر أن يشاهد فيه الأنواع المختلفة من المرجان والأسماك وغيرها من الكائنات الحية المستوطنة في خليج العقبة. قامت هيئة تنشيط السياحة بعمل إعلانات وحملات دعائية، بمساعدة من الاتحاد الأوروبي.\nخلال فترة الأعياد الوطنية يأتي الأردنيون من شمال المملكة، ولا سيما من عمان واربد، إلى المنتجعات والشواطئ الرملية، لقضاء عطلة نهاية الأسبوع وخلال هذه الفترة تصل نسبة الإشغال في الفنادق إلى 100%. في 2011 اختيرت العقبة عاصمة للسياحة العربية.\nكما يوجد في مُحافظة العَقَبة وادي رم ذو الطّبيعة الرمليّة والجبليّة السّاحرة. وفي جنوب العَقَبة أعلى ارتفاع في الأردن على الإطلاق مُتمثّلأ بجبل أم الداميّ.\nتم افتتاح عام 2019 أول متحف عسكري مائي للغواصين في الأردن \nسيتم في عام 2020 الانتهاء من مشروع تطوير وتأهيل سارية العلم الموجودة في ساحة الثورة العربية الكبرى وستعتبر وجهة سياحية تتضمن خمس متاحف وأهم ما يميزها احتوائها على بيت الشريف حسين\n\nالاقتصاد\nاهتمت الأردن بالعقبة منذ التسعينات، لأنها الميناء الأردني الوحيد. سعى الأردن لتطوير العقبة بأكثر من صيغة، انتهت إلى إعطاء منطقة العقبة وضعا خاصا، مثل الحوافز، والإعفاء من الضرائب، والرسوم، والاستقلال الإداري عن عمان، كما تم وضع الخطط لاجتذاب الإستثمار الأجنبي. اقتصاد العقبة نما بسرعة كبيرة جدا بسبب إنشاء منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة. وهناك تطور في العمران (الإسكان) وتشييد منتجعات جيدة، ومشاريع جديدة مثل خليج تالا بي وسرايا العقبة التي ستكون مكان لإمضاء العطل والإجازات في منازل سكنية متطورة للسياح والمواطنين على حد سواء. وتم استثمار أكثر من عشرين مليار دولار في العقبة منذ العام 2001 عندما تم تأسيس المنطقة الاقتصادية الخاصة. وجذبت العقبة أيضا شركات لوجستية عالمية مثل ايه بي إم تيرمينالز واجيليتي للاستثمار في مجال الخدمات اللوجستية، مما عزز من وضع المدينة كمركز للنقل والخدمات اللوجستية.\nتوجد العديد من الفنادق في العقبة ولكن هناك أيضا فنادق جديدة قيد الإنشاء. العقبة هي الميناء البحري الوحيد للأردن لذلك تقريبا أغلب صادرات الأردن تغادر من هذه المدينة. أكثر من 20 مليار دولار من الاستثمارات تتدفق إلى العقبة من منطقة الخليج ومستثمريين أوروبيين، مما يجعل العقبة تتفوق على إيلات سياحيا واستثماريا، إيلات تلك المدينة المزدهرة التي تقع على بعد بضع كيلومترات فقط.\nبحلول عام 2008 كانت منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة جذبت 18 مليار دولار من الاستثمارات، وبهذا تكون المدينة ضربت الرقم 6 مليارات دولار الذي طمحت أن تصل إليه بحلول عام 2020، بمقدار 300% وأكثر من ذلك في أقل من عقد من الزمان. وقامت المدينة بتعديل هدفها الذي أصبح جلب 12 مليار دولار أخرى بحلول عام 2020، لكن في عام 2009 وحده وقّعت المدينة على صفقات بقيمة 14 مليار دولار. بعض المشاريع قيد الإنشاء حاليا وهي على النحو الآتي:\n\nسرايا العقبة: 1.5 مليار دولار لبناء منتجع يضم بحيرة صناعية، فنادق فخمة، فلل، ومنازل فخمة على أن يكتمل المشروع بحلول عام 2017.\nمنتجع واحة آيلا بقيمة 2.1 مليار دولار وبحيرة صناعية المنتجع مع فنادق فخمة، فلل، ت وملعب للجولف ذي 18 حفرة. ويحمل المنتجع طابعٌ يمثلُ بندقيةً عربية، بطريقة تصميم المباني التي بنيت على طول قنوات مائية لا يمكن الوصول إليها الا عن طريق قوارب أو مسارات خاصة. إلى جانب حديقة مائية جزء من مشروع واحة آيلا' الذي سوف يكتمل بحلول عام 2017.\nخليج تالا بي عبارة عن مجتمع منتقى ومتكامل، يقوم على مساحة مسيجة تبلغ 2.7 مليون متراً مربعا، يقع على الطرف الشمالي لخليج العقبة. وهذا المشروع اكتمل بقيمته 680 مليون دولار. كما يضم خليج تالا بي منتجعات وفنادق 4 أو 5 مثل فندق الهيلتون.\nمرسى زايد، أكبر مشروع عقاري وسياحي على مستوى المنطقة، يمتد على مساحة 3.2 كم مربع ويشمل واجهة مائية بطول 2 كم. ويهدف مشروع مرسى زايد إلى تطوير الواجهة البحرية وتحويلها إلى بيئة مؤهلة للاستخدام المتعدد الأغراض تنتشر عليها الأبراج السكنية المرتفعة والمناطق المخصصة للمرافق الترفيهية والسياحية وأخرى مخصصة للأعمال التجارية والفنادق العالمية، على أكثر من ثلاثة ملايين متر مربع من الأراضي. ومن جهة أخرى، ستعد مراسي اليخوت المتعددة التي سيتم إنشاؤها إضافة هامة للطاقة الاستيعابية للمراسي القائمة حالياً في مدينة العقبة، مما يسهم في تحويل مدينة العقبة إلى وجهة رئيسية لليخوت، بالإضافة لإنشاء ميناء حديث للبواخر السياحية معد وفق أفضل ما توصلت إليه التقنيات الحديثة في هذا المجال ليمثل بوابة للترحيب بزوار العقبة. سيتم تنفيذ هذا المشروع على عدة مراحل على مدار 30 عاما، ومن المقرر ان يكتمل المشروع بحلول عام 2017.\nنقل الميناء سوف سيتم نقل ميناء العقبة إلى الجزء الجنوبي من المحافظة بالقرب من الحدود السعودية، بحلول عام 2016 حسب ما هو مقرر. وتطوير الميناء ليكون مرفأ متطورا يضاهي المرافئ العالمية.\nسيتم ربط العقبة بمشروع شبكة السكك الوطنية، الذي سيتم الانتهاء منه بحلول عام 2013. وسوف يربط مشروع السكك الحديدية في العقبة مع جميع المدن الرئيسية في الأردن والمراكز الاقتصادية والعديد من الدول مثل المملكة العربية السعودية والعراق وسوريا.\n\nمنطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة\nاطلقت منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة (ASEZ) في عام 2001 بوصفها معفاة من الرسوم الجمركية، منطقة تنموية متعددة القطاعات بضرائب مخفضة تضم كامل منطقة الساحل الأردني (27 كم)، الموانئ البحرية الأردنية، ومطار دولي ومدينة العقبة التاريخية. تنظم منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة من قبل سلطة منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة وهي مكلفة بإدارة وتنظيم، وتقديم الخدمات البلدية داخل منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة. تعمل منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة بمبادرة تنموية مدفوعة من القطاع الخاص حيث تعمل على تعظيم مشاركة القطاع الخاص في السوق الحرة والاستفادة من المزايا الضريبية والبيئة التنظيمية المرنة. بالإضافة إلى جعلها وجهة سياحية فريدة على البحر الأحمر، مع واحة تسوق معفاة من الرسوم الجمركية يرافقه نوعية حياة عالية ومستوى معيشة.\n\nالمواصلات\nالنقل البري\nالعقبة متصلة بالعاصمة عمان، المناطق المجاورة والدول الحدودية بشبكة حديثة من الطرق السريعة، القادمين من عمان يمكن ان يسلكو طريق البحر الميت أو سلوك الطريق الصحراوي الذي يعبر صحراء الديسي وصحراء وادي رم حيث قام لورانس العرب بعبورها مع قافلته. اما النقل من وإلى ايلات عن طريق معبر وادي عربة، ومع المملكة العربية السعودية من مدينة حقل عبر مركز حدود الدرة.\nهناك العديد من الشركات التي تقدم خدمة المواصلات بين العقبة وعمان وغيرها من المدن الأخرى بواسطة حافلات حديثة. وتعتبر شركة جت وسيلة النقل الأكثر شيوعا، ويوجد أيضا شركة الثقة، وشركة المتميز. ويمكنك أيضا الوصول إلى العقبة عبر الحافلات العمومية. سكة حديد العقبة لاتنقل حاليا الركاب والمسافرين، بل هي مقتصرة في الوقت الحاضر على نقل البضائع.\n\nالنقل البحري\nتقدم شركة الجسر العربي للملاحة رحلات إلى العقبة من وإلى الموانئ المصرية قادمة من طابا ونويبع، حيث سافر أكثر من مليون مسافر بين العقبة ومرافئ نويبع وشرم الشيخ. اتحاد شركات من شركات أبو ظبي يسمى 'شركة المعبر' فاز بمناقصة لنقل وإدارة ميناء العقبة لمدة 30 عاما، ليستوعب 1.3 مليون راكب والآلاف من الشاحنات والسيارات القادمة من مختلف أنحاء الشواطئ في المصرية.\n\nالنقل الجوي\nيوفر مطار الملك حسين الدولي الواقع شمال المدينة، رحلات منتظمة من عمان إلى العقبة في رحلة تستغرق حوالي 45 دقيقة. ورحلات منتظمة إلى العقبة من عمان ودبي والإسكندرية (مصر)، بالإضافة إلى أوروبا.\n\nالتعليم\nالجامعة الأردنية فرع العقبة\nجامعة العقبة للتكنولوجيا\nكلية العقبة الجامعية / جامعة البلقاء التطبيقية\nيوجد ايضاً بالمحافظة العديد من

          "summary": "العقبة هي المدينة الساحلية الوحيدة في الأردن، والمدينة الأكبر والأكثر سكانا بين مدن خليج العقبة جميعها. تقع العقبة في أقصى جنوب المملكة الأردنيّة الهاشميّة على ساحل البحر الأحمر، وهي مركز محافظة العقبة. تبعد المدينة حوالي 330 كيلومتر جنوب العاصمة الأردنية عمّان. وقد بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2015 حوالي 148,398 نسمة، حيث تُعد خامس أكبر مدينة في المملكة. وتبلغ مساحة المدينة 375 كيلومتر مربع (144.8 ميل2). وللعقبة دور كبير في الاقتصاد الوطني الأردني وتطويره؛ وذلك من خلال كل من القطاعين التجاري والسياحي. ويُذكر أن ميناء العقبة يعد معبرا بحريا مهما للدول الأخرى المجاورة للأردن كذلك.\nبسبب موقعها الاستراتيجي في أعلى شمال شرقي خليج العقبة المتفرع من البحر الأحمر، والذي يتوسط الطرق التجارية بين قارتي آسيا وإفريقيا؛ كل ذلك جعل من العقبة ومنفذها البحري منطقة مهمة عبر آلاف السنين. بالإضافة لذلك، تتميز مدينة العقبة بأنها منطقة إستراتيجية والمنفذ البحري الوحيد للأردن، كما أنَّ للعقبة حدود برية مع مدينة حقل في المملكة العربية السعودية عبر مركز حدود الدرة، وحدود بحرية مع مصر وأيضا مع مدينة إيلات عبر معبر وادي عربة وكلتا المدينتين تقعا على رأس خليج العقبة المتفرع من البحر الأحمر. وتشتهر العقبة بكونها منطقة جاذبة لهواة الغوص بشواطئها المطلة على البحر الأحمر. وتضم المدينة العديد من المنشآت الصناعية الهامة، والمناطق التجارية الحرة، ومطار الملك حسين الدولي. وتعتبر مركزا إدارياً مهماً في منطقة أقصى جنوب الأردن. ومصدر للفوسفات وبعض أنواع الصدف. ويقدر عدد سكان المدينة بحوالي 150,000 نسمة.\nالاسم القديم للمدينة بحسب التوراة العبرية كان إيلات، وهو الاسم الذي استمر في الحقب اللاحقة الرومانية وفي عهود الخلافة الإسلامية على شكل أيلة، ثم آيلة. وبسبب موقعها موقعها الاستراتيجي وقربها من مناجم النحاس، فقد كانت مركزًا إقليميًا لإنتاج النحاس وتجارته خلال العصر النحاسي. خلال الاحتلال البزنطي للمنطقة، أصبحت العقبة -أيلة آنذاك - أبرشية نصرانية، لتتحول بعد ذلك خلال الحكم العربي الإسلامي لأبرشية فخرية، وذلك عندما صار اسم المدينة آيلة. أما اسم العقبة الحالي فهو ظهر في العهود المتأخرة من القرون الوسطى. وخلال الثورة العربية الكبرى، وقعت في العقبة معركة عرفت تاريخيا باسم معركة العقبة والتي كان لانتصار العرب فيها على الأتراك الأثر الحاسم في جلاء الأتراك عن البلاد العربية.\nموقع مدينة العقبة بالقرب من وادي رم ومدينة البتراء إحدى عجائب الدنيا السبع، جعل منها ومن المواقع المذكور ما يعرف بمثلث الأردن السياحي الذهبي؛ الشيء الذي قوّى من مكانتها السياحية على الخريطة العالمية، كما جعلها واحدة من كبريات الوجهات السياحية الجاذبة في الأردن. تُدار العقبة اقتصاديا وخدماتيا من خلال سلطة منطقة العقبة الاقتصادية الخاصة، والتي ساهمت بتحويل مدينة العقبة إلى مدينة منخفضة الضرائب وخالية من الرسوم الجمركية، مما جعلها نقطة جاذبة لكبريات المشاريع مثل منتجعات آيلة وسرايا العقبة ومرسى زايد  و هناك ايضاً رفاهيات مثل مهرجان العقبة و فعاليات رياضية مثل سباقات القوارب وغيرها وايضاً  توسعة ميناء العقبة. كل تلك المشاريع من المتوقع منها أن تحول العقبة إلى نقطة جذب سياحية كبرى على مستوى الإقليم. ومع ذلك، تبقى للأنشطة التجارية والصناعية أهميتها الكبيرة؛ وذلك بسبب موقع العقبة وطبيعتها الاستراتيجية، كونها هي المنفذ البحري الوحيد للأردن على العالم.",

          "content": "Aqaba ou Akaba (en arabe : العقبة al-ʻAqabah) est une ville côtière de 88 780 habitants à l'extrémité sud de la Jordanie.\nAqaba occupe une position stratégique pour la Jordanie car c'est le seul port du pays. La ville est mitoyenne d'Eilat, en Israël, et un poste-frontière permet de s'y rendre. Aqaba et Eilat sont à la pointe nord du golfe d'Aqaba.\n\nHistoire\nAqaba est le site d'un peuplement habité depuis 4000 av. J.-C., notamment en raison de sa position stratégique au carrefour des routes commerciales entre l'Asie, l'Afrique et l'Europe. Le peuplement originel est connu sous le nom de Eilat (אֵילַת ou, dans la bible, Eilot : אֵלוֹת) en hébreu (et sans doute[réf. nécessaire] en édomite). C'était un centre édomite puis arabe nabatéen.\nLa Bible mentionne le lieu : « Le Roi Salomon construisit également des bateaux à Ezion-Geber, près de Eilat en pays édomite, au bord de la mer Rouge ». Ce verset fait probablement référence à un port de l'âge du fer construit sur la position actuelle d'Aqaba/Eilat.\nSous la dynastie des Ptolémées, les Grecs appellent la ville Bérénice, puis les Romains Aila et Aelena. Sous les Romains,  la Via Nova Traiana qui allait de Damas à Amman se prolongeait jusqu'à Aqaba, où elle rejoignait la route qui allait de l'Égypte à la Palestine.\nPeu après la mort de Mahomet, Aqaba fait partie du califat, et passe successivement entre les mains des Omeyyades, Abbassides, Fatimides et Mamelouks. Le début de l'ère musulmane voit la construction de la ville de Ayla, décrite par le géographe Shams Eddin Muqaddasi comme étant juste à côté de l'implantation originelle, alors en ruines. Ces ruines, révélées dans les années 1980 par une équipe archéologique américano-jordanienne, sont situées à faible distance du front de mer.\nAu XIIe siècle, les Croisés occupent la ville et construisent la forteresse de Helim, qui reste relativement bien préservée aujourd'hui. En plus de bâtir un fort dans Aqaba, les Croisés fortifient la petite île nommée Île de Graye (maintenant connue sous le nom d’Île du Pharaon, à 7 kilomètres de la côte). L'île se trouve désormais en territoire égyptien. Dès 1170, Aqaba et l'Île de Graye sont reconquises par Saladin. Les Mamelouks prennent la ville en 1250 et reconstruisent le fort au XVIe siècle au cours du règne d'un des derniers sultans Mamelouks, Qansah al-Ghouri.\nAu début du XVIe siècle, la dynastie mamelouk et la région passent sous influence ottomane. Sous les Ottomans, l'importance de la ville décline : Aqaba devient un simple village de pêcheurs.\nDurant la Première Guerre mondiale, les forces ottomanes sont forcées de se retirer de la ville en 1917 après un raid mené par Lawrence d'Arabie et les forces arabes de Hussein ben Ali. La région est alors annexée par le royaume du Hedjaz. La prise d'Aqaba permet l'approvisionnement à partir de l'Égypte, des forces arabes et britanniques combattant plus au nord, en Transjordanie et en Palestine. Aqaba est incorporée au protectorat britannique de Transjordanie en 1925.\n\nEn 1965, le roi Hussein de Jordanie élargit le territoire autour d'Aqaba. En échange de 6 000 km2 en Jordanie centrale, l'Arabie saoudite donne 12 kilomètres de côte au sud d'Aqaba. En plus de permettre l'extension du port, cet échange donne également accès à la Jordanie au magnifique corail de Yamanieh.\nJusqu'à la Guerre du Golfe, Aqaba était un des importateurs majeurs de biens irakiens.\nLe 20 août 2005, une attaque à la roquette vise deux bateaux de l'U.S. Navy (l'USS Ashland et l'USS Kearsarge) à quai. L'attaque les manque mais endommage des bâtiments voisins. L'attaque visait aussi la ville israélienne voisine d'Eilat.\n\nÉconomie\nDe nos jours, la ville est une station balnéaire et un centre de plongée. Cependant, il reste de nombreuses activités industrielles dans la zone, comme des raffineries de pétrole et de sucre. Elle exporte notamment du phosphate et des coquillages. Aqaba est également un centre administratif important au sud de la Jordanie.\nAqaba possède un aéroport (code IATA : AQJ). En 2010, des travaux pour réaménager la ville commence et le projet, du nom de Marsa Zayed, doit apporter à terme la construction de hautes tours, des hôtels, des magasins, résidentiels et récréatifs.\nEn 2011 était prise la décision de créer un parc à thème portant sur Star Trek - le premier au monde - sur la région d'Aqaba. Prévu pour ouvrir ses portes en 2014, ce parc devait coûter 1,5 milliard de dollars - chiffre impressionnant mais inférieur au coût d'un parc type Universal ou Disney. Ce projet tenait à cœur au roi qui est un \"Trekkie\" confirmé puisqu'il a fait une apparition dans un épisode de la série Star Trek : Voyager en 1995 mais celui-ci a été annulé début 2015.\nEn septembre 2017 est lancé le projet Sahara Forest Project, près d'Aqaba, qui vise à transformer des terres désertiques en terres cultivables. Le projet souhaite aboutir à une production de 130 tonnes de légumes biologiques par an, 10.000 litres d'eau potable à partir d'eau de mer, et va utiliser des panneaux photovoltaïques pour la production d'énergie solaire. Une station de désalinisation et un bassin pour la production de sel seront construits. Le projet, d'un coût de 750 millions d'euros, est soutenu par la Norvège et l'Union européenne.\n\nJumelages\nHammamet (Tunisie) depuis 1981\n Varna (Bulgarie)\n\nGalerie\nNotes et références\nAnnexes\nArticles connexes\nGhassanides (220-638), phylarcat arabe suzerain de l'Empire byzantin\nAncienne église d'Aqaba, Église de l'Orient, nestorianisme\nAnciennes cités établies sur le site  :\nEzion-Geber (époque biblique)\nAilana (époque romano-byzantine)\nAyla (époque musulmane)\nEilat (Israël)\nHampe de drapeau d'Aqaba\nMusée archéologique d'Aqaba\nUsine de dessalement de Jordanie\n\nLiens externes\n\nSite officiel\n\n(en) Histoire d'Aqaba\nMaxime Goepp, Benjamin Saintamon, « Aila (Jordanie) :: Princée d'Outre Jourdain », sur « Forteresses d'Orient »\n Portail de la Jordanie",

          "content": "## Overview\nAqaba (العقبة al-ʿAqabah) is Jordan's only port city. It is on the Gulf of Aqaba in the extreme south of the country, adjacent to Eilat in Israel.\n\n## Understand\nAqaba is Jordan's window on the Red Sea. Historically the same city as Eilat on the Israeli side of the border, plans for a shared international airport and other forms of cooperation have cooled down in the past few years during a period of political tension.  Aqaba has seen a lot of development.  This has improved the infrastructure and facilities.  Be prepared for road maps to be incorrect or out of date.\n\n## Get in\nWhen entering Jordan in Aqaba you may be entitled to a free visa. Further details you can find in the Jordan article.\n\n## By bus\nLocal minibuses connect residential areas with downtown. The fare is 17 piasters (0.17 JD) regardless of the length of the journey. Passengers can get on and off at any point of the route.\nThe central bus station is in front of the police station in King Talal street, less than 10 min walk from city centre (Ayla Square, Al-Hussein Bin Ali Mosque).\n\n## By car\nAmman to Aqaba is about 350 km using the Desert Highway. It will take about 4 hr to travel this distance at a reasonable speed. Service/fuel stops are not very frequent on this road.\nThere is a customs checkpoint at the border of the Aqaba Special Economic Zone. Officers will probably check the trunk of your car, but the checks are usually quick for private cars and taxis.\n\n## By taxi\nTaxis are easily available in the city. A ride within town should cost no more than 2 JD. A ride outside town (to a beach near by or to any border crossings) costs around 5 JD. However, if your hotel calls you a taxi, you may end up paying double for it as they receive a kickback (this is especially true if you are staying on the South Beach).\nWhile taxis are yellow all around Jordan, Aqaba taxis have been painted green and blue: the logo colours of Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZ).\nWhen negotiating the price of a taxi, make sure to determine whether the final cost is the total or \"per-person\" price, as you may otherwise receive a surprise at the end of the ride.\nApp-based taxies, such as the regional Careem or Uber, are not available within the city. You will have to use the local taxis.\n\n## By plane\n29.61161935.0180672 King Hussein International Airport (AQJ  IATA) (9 km (5.6 mi) north of Aqaba, about 20 min to drive).\nServed by a few airlines. Royal Jordanian operates between Amman and Aqaba. Duration of the flight is approximately one hour and costs around 50 JD + tax one-way. If there are two or more of you, it may be cheaper to take a taxi, especially once you factor in getting to and from the airport at each end.\nNote there is no public transport to and from the airport. To get a taxi that is cheaper than at the airport you can walk to the Jordan Valley Highway. That's how the locals do it. At the police checkpoint of the airport you may have to show your passport and answer where you are walking to.\nAlso you could hitchhike from the Jordan Valley Highway to Aqaba. Depending on the driver it may be for free or cost 1-2 JD. Agree on the price before you enter the car.\nMost larger hotels and dive operators can arrange airport transfers and hire-cars. Taxis in the airport are available for a fixed price. There is a big sign that shows you the prices.\nAn Israeli company offers a so-called \"Aqaba airport shuttle\" service through its website, which appears to be a scam, according to numerous online reviews on a number of different websites.\nGiven the relatively painless (for the area at least) border crossing process and the closeness of Eilat, it is also feasible to fly into Ramon Airport ETM IATA, which is served by the likes of Ryanair. The former Ovda and Eilat city airports have both closed. To cross the border, you need to pay the Israeli departure tax.\n\n## From other countries\nIf you are coming from Eilat, Israel, you will cross through the Yitzhak Rabin Terminal. It is open Sunday-Thursday from 06:30–20:00 and Friday-Saturday from 08:00–20:00, except for Yom Kippur and the Muslim New Year. Taxi from Eilat centre to the border is ₪35 (Feb 2014). The fee to exit Israel is ₪102 plus a processing fee of ₪5 – you can pay with credit card.\nIf you are planning to come to Aqaba directly from northern Israel (e.g. from Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, or Be'er Sheva) by catching an Egged bus to Eilat, or from Eilat by hopping on any intercity bus going up north, or on any of the buses going to Ramon airport, you should ask the driver to let you off at \"Rabin Border Crossing / Road 90 junction\", which is the second last stop before the bus station in Eilat, and then walk east to the border checkpoint (less than 1 km on auto route 109).\nAfter crossing the border, take a taxi from the taxi cartel (see below) for 11 JD, or just walk out. If the bird observatory to the right is open, walk straight through until the road with the fence and continue through the treatment plant further on another deserted road until you reach the housing area. From here, taxis are very cheap. If the bird observatory is closed, go through the sandy desert area to the right after it around the treatment plant until the road north of the new golf course, resort and oasis. It is best to have a map or GPS. If you get bothered by the taxi mafia, just keep walking, don't talk. The other way around is easier: either you walk through the treatment plant or cross through the sandy desert area straight north just before the treatment plant. If you get a taxi from the city for 5 JD, it is fine. 13 JD is way too much. In any case, if you feel you have been bothered, complain to the Ministry of Tourism & Antiquities[dead link].\nFerries run regularly from Aqaba across to Nuweiba on Egypt's Sinai peninsula, bypassing Israel and the sometimes complicated border arrangements. Generally, there is no visa fee for entering Jordan through Aqaba since it is a part of the free trade zone. The line to Nuweiba is operated by ABMaritime; see their website for the timetable and current prices.\nAlso ferries from Taba and Sharm el-Sheikh are available. There is more information about the boat crossing in the itinerary Ferries in The Red Sea.\n\n## On foot\nMost points of interest can be reached on foot, and that is really the best way to see the place and experience Aqaba.\n\n## See\nAs of December 2018, the staff at the information center near the castle claims that there is no place to use Jordan Pass in Aqaba, even though two museums are listed on the official website of Jordan Pass.\n29.52146535.0020471 Aqaba Castle (قلعة العقبة) (at the southern end of the city beach, behind the flagpole and museum). under reconstruction as of December 2018. It dates to the 14th century, although the present structure was built by the Mamluke sultan Qansawh el-Ghawri (1501-1516) and has been revised many times since then. The archaeological museum which used to be here no longer exists. 3 JD or free with Jordan Pass.      (updated Jul 2022)\n29.51668935.0015392 Aqaba Heritage Museum (at the southern end of the city). A simple museum on local history and people.\n29.53117335.0002653 Ayla (next to the Mövenpick resort). The old city that was established when Islam came to the area in 622 AD. 1 JD.\n29.533734.9994 Aqaba Church (Behind the JETT bus station, which is just west of the Mövenpick Resort & Residences). The oldest purpose-built Christian church in history. A posted sign (viewed in the right angle) gives a little bit of information on the church and its age.      (updated May 2021)\n29.52150335.0007955 Aqaba Flagpole (at the southern end of the city beach). The sixth tallest freestanding flagpole sits at a height of 130 metres high. It carries the flag of the Arab Revolt.\n29.51844535.0123196 Sheik Zayed Mosque. This mosque in the east beyond the highway gives a great overview of the area and Aqaba.\n29.458134.9767667 Marine Science Center Aquarium (5 km south of Aqaba). Small aquarium with a few local and exotic fish. Very small aquarium with limited information, not worth the high price for foreigners, but Jordanians (1 JD) might want to take their kids. 7 JD.\n\n## Do\nExcept the sea and diving, Aqaba doesn't have a lot of things to offer. The following can be of interest but are easily done in one day.\nAqaba Castle\nAqaba museum\nFourth century Roman church\nThere is a public beach between the city and the fort, although it can be very dirty.  There are several public beaches south of Aqaba, which also can be dirty.  Beaches generally have eating and showering facilities and sometimes watersports.\n29.5299935.033911 Mount Um al Nusaylah (try hiking up near Domina Aquamarina III Hotel, 1 km east of the bus station). Hike this mountain for a great view of the Aqaba area, Eilat on the other side of the Red Sea and the valley behind the mount.\n\n## Scuba diving\nHave a look at an online map south of Aqaba, such as in the Tala Bay article; many dive centers can be found there, and diving is extremely popular. A two-dive single-day package typically costs around 50 JD, but booking multi-dive packages in advance can save a lot. Almost all dives are shore based. A small number of sites are better accessed by boat, though the journey is never more than 45 min and is typically in the 20-min range. Though dive packages tend to be more expensive than nearby Egypt, the quality of operators is much more consistent, and the fact virtually all dives are done as shore dives save both money and time with day-boats. Diving here is also good for beginners, as there are no tides, and currents and swells this far up the gulf of Aqaba are minimal, which also means diving any given site is all but guaranteed, regardless of what the weather is up to.\n29.53241935.0010562 Ahlan Aqaba Scuba Diving Center, Al Nahda St., Hotel area in the heart of the city (The road behind the Mövenpick Hotel), ☏ +962 3 2062242, fax: +962 3 206 2243, info@diveinaqaba.com. 24/7. Adventurous diving trips in the Red Sea area. Highly committed to the conservation of the local reef. Perform weekly surveys of the rubbish on particular dive sites for the PADI Dive Against Debris project. Snorkeling, try dives, fun dives for certified divers, shore and boat dives and beginners courses through to Dive masters. Digital Underwater Photography (which only 4% of instructors can teach!)\n\n## Buy\nAll ATMs charge a relatively high fee for withdrawing money. In Jordan you can withdraw money from your credit card in various currency exchange places. A reliable and low-priced currency exchange service is Alawneh Exchange in the city center. They charge a low percentage fee for withdrawing money from your credit card. Many locals use that agency. You need to show your passport.\nAqaba is a tax-free zone so prices for expensive consumer items tend to be lower than elsewhere in Jordan. Hence, the high number of shops specialized in nuts and sweets, catering for Jordanian tourists.\nBeware however should you depart by plane from Aqaba: the Aqaba airport security check mafia will confiscate many types of goods on departure. See the note on the Aqaba airport security check mafia below.\n\n## Eat\nIn the centre of the city you can find very good hummus, falafel and shawarma (lamb meat in pita bread) places in many local restaurants. Prices start from 0.20 JD for stuffed pies (fatayer), 0.50 JD for a falafel sandwich, 1 JD for ful, baba ganous or hummus and pita, 1.50 JD for pizza-like snacks and 1.50 JD for a shawarma dish. Walk around to find the hole-in-the-wall eateries.\nFor local seafood, head to the Al-Afran street (locally known as the \"fishmarket\" or \"Souq As-Samak\"), which is located near the citadel and the beach area. The street is lined up with dozens of local fish shops (\"masmakeh\" in Arabic) that sell all kinds of seafood, and the majoity of customers are locals. In most shops, you can select your preference from the fresh catch of the day and specify how you want it to be cooked (e.g. grilled or deep-fried). You can also select standard meals from a fixed menu, such as sayadieh. Prices will vary according to the selected fish, but usually range from 5 to 10 JD per person. As of 2022, there's a new fishmarket building under construction  just south of the citadel, to which some of the shops may relocate in the future.\nMore fancy seafood restaurants are located around downtown (especially to the North). Some of those are local branches of eateries that also exist in other Jordanian cities, especailly Amman.\n\n## Budget\n29.52877935.00371 Dweik Hotel 1 (between Zahran St. and Raghadan St.).

They also sell very cheap shisha for 2 dinars each (updated January 2023)\n\n## Aqaba border taxi cartel\nTaxis at the border from Eilat belong to one company, which has a monopoly, and is therefore much more expensive than a typical Jordanian taxi: 11 JD (Feb 2014) for a 15-minute ride to the Aqaba bus station. This is no matter how many people go in the car, be insistent if you are told that sharing a taxi is not allowed. Also as of October 2014, there is a sign listing fixed prices to various destinations (8 JD to the airport, 11 JD to Aqaba, 55 JD to Petra, etc.) Once you get in to Aqaba, however, taxis to Petra are 35 JD, and the Wadi Musa taxi drivers will offer the same price back. Going the other way from Aqaba city centre to the border can be done for 8-10 JD (6-8 JD if you're lucky, Feb 2014).\nThe taxi company, just outside the customs gate, might stop other drivers and have them turn back to Aqaba. To try to avoid this, call your hotel or private car while still in the customs area.\nYou can try walking the 500 m to the main road (east), but the military personnel may have you brought back. Or you take a turn right directly after the border and follow the small sideroads to Aqaba—check OpenStreetMap or Google Maps for the situation.\nYou can ride right past if you have a bicycle, but you'll have to cross the border by foot. Even though bicycles are vehicles in the eyes of the road laws, they will force you to dismount and pass the border as if you were a pedestrian.\nIt is possible to bargain them down, but you will need to be persistent and enlist the help of the border police to mediate. Don't try to set the price too low. 5 JD to the airport is about as low as they'll go - 10 JD to Aqaba is most likely. Stay polite, but be firm and explain to the border police that it is not a good first impression for tourists to have and that you will write to the Ministry of Tourism. This threat normally sees the taxi cartel back down, but there are no guarantees.\nRiding back to the border from city center can be a problem. Should they have to wait, they'll try to switch on the taximeter and ask for 25-30 JD instead of the arranged 10 JD. Don't get intimidated, insist on the agreed pricing and perhaps offer 2 JD on top of the 10 to quiet things.\n\n## Aqaba Airport security check\nBeware of the security check scams, which have been reported as of late 2019: excuses will be made to confiscate locally-purchased luxuries for resale on the black market. Among items that seem to be systematically seized are purchases of Dead Sea beauty products, honey, molasses, and alcohol. Nothing including any sort of liquid can be considered safe, even in signed-in bags.\nAstute negotiation will help save some items, but beware of fake helpers: the scam clearly does not implicate everyone in the airport but your allies will probably not be those who will insistently offer to \"help\" you.\nIn any case keep calm and avoid escalating the situation. Innocently destroying the commercial value of confiscated goods might be an option, and perhaps open the packaging of any products to show that they could not possibly be dangerous. This could probably also be done in advance of your flight (defacing the labels for instance). Please do your bit and also report any incident to the Jordan Tourism Board. It is so sad to see the good vibes of this pleasant destination squandered by a few corrupt elements only minutes before leaving the country!\n\n## Go next\nIt can difficult to get mini-bus on Friday which is prayers' day, and on Friday and Saturday when there is no school. Try to check it with tourist information, bus station, police and your hotel.\nMany destinations that are not north of Amman can be reached on a day trip. You can set up your own flexible day trips by hiring a taxi for the day. However, some require more than one day, especially Petra and Wadi Rum. Make sure when you set up the trip that you have agreed on the destinations to be included in the trip (or you may need to discuss your price while on the road and do not have other options that your current driver). Alternatively, there are a lot of tour companies around town who would happily arrange excursions, in particular to Wadi Rum.\nWadi Rum — barren, isolated and beautiful, granite cliffs contrasting with desert sand, 50 km north of Aqaba. A trip here is only really complete with an overnight stay at one of the numerous camps.\nPetra — Jordan's top attraction, 2.5 hr north of Aqaba. An ancient city carved out of sandstone and one of the new 7 Wonders of the World. Can be done in a day if you are good on foot, but most people spend two days.\nDana Nature Reserve — Stay in a local village  within the Nature Reserve, and enjoy unforgettable hiking in an offshoot of the Great Rift.\nKerak — site of a once-mighty Crusader castle.\nMadaba — known as the 'City of Mosaics' for its Byzantine and Umayyad mosaics, especially a large Byzantine-era mosaic map of Palestine and the Nile delta at St. George Church.\nDead Sea — The lowest point on earth and the most saline sea, letting you float on top.\n\n## To Israel (Eilat)\nThe Israeli border at Arava (for Eilat) is only a short hop away. As of June 2022, the 10 JD exit tax is only charged to those who have stayed in the country for two nights or less (evidenced by the entry date on the visa stamp), even with the free ASEZA visa. Those that have stayed longer are not charged any tax. Note: if one does not have ASEZA visa, you have to pay the full visa fee as well if you stayed less than 4 days—see Jordan#Visa.\nAfter security, the counters are consolidated into 1-3 desks depending on the number of people passing through that day. If the exit tax/visa fee is applicable, one must pay it in cash to the border officer receive the exit stamp. Without this stamp you will not be allowed through the final check, and into no-man's land.\nGetting to the border is not as expensive or thrilling as getting from the border (see #Stay safe). Any green taxi in the city will be willing to take you there. The price they offer first is 7 JD or 10 JD, you can haggle it down to 5 JD if you haggling skills are good. Or you just walk from the edge of the city.\nThe border itself is rather quiet, which is surprising for an Israeli border. Just follow the signs. The crossing can take anywhere from half an hour to two hours depending on the size of the queue and how thoroughly the authorities are conducting screening that day.\n\n## To Saudi Arabia\nThe Saudi Arabian checkpoint is visible on a clear day, but visitors without a visa can only look.\n\n## To Egypt (Nuweiba)\nFerries to Egypt are operated by AB Maritime. The schedule changes rapidly with cancellations common, so it's recommended to check it when you arrive in Aqaba. As of November 20, 2011\nThe fast ferry is not operating\nThere is a slow ferry departing Aqaba at 13:00\nThere is a slow ferry departing Aqaba at 01:00\nThis will change based on seasonal loadings. The approximate cost for foreigners is US$65 + 5 JD departure fee. Pay the departure fee on the ground floor of the terminal building, then take the coupon upstairs for immigration purposes. After copious amounts of stamping, you can go and wait outside.\nIt is also recommended that you ring the AB Maritime ferry office to confirm the departure time for that day. Delays of several hours are common and sometimes known in advance.\nAlso ferries to Taba and Sharm el-Sheikh are available from Aqaba.",

          "content": "Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء‎, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα, lit. 'Rock'), originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu (Nabataean Aramaic: 𐢛𐢚𐢒‎ or 𐢛𐢚𐢓𐢈‎, *Raqēmō), is an ancient city and archaeological site in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also called the \"Rose City\" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved. The city is one of the New 7 Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and was settled by the Nabataeans, a nomadic Arab people, in the 4th century BC. Petra would later become the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom in the second century BC. The Nabataeans invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub, which gained them considerable revenue. Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and thus were able to defend their kingdom. They were particularly skillful in agriculture, stone carving, and rainwater harvesting.\nPetra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants. Nabataea fell to the Romans in 106 AD, who annexed and renamed it Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.\nUNESCO has described Petra as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\". Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Visitor numbers reach close to a million tourists every year.\n\nHistory\nNeolithic\nBy 7000 BC, some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in Beidha, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement just north of Petra.\n\nBronze Age\nPetra is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and the Amarna letters as Pel, Sela, or Seir.\n\nIron Age Edom\nThe Iron Age lasted between 1200 and 600 BC; in that time, the Petra area was occupied by the Edomites. The configuration of mountains in Petra allowed for a reservoir of water for the Edomites. This made Petra a stopping point for merchants, making it an outstanding area for trade. Some wares that were traded included wines, olive oil, and wood.\nInitially, the Edomites were accompanied by Nomads who eventually left, but the Edomites stayed and made their mark on Petra before the emergence of the Nabataens. It is said that 10,000 men were thrown off of the mountain Umm el-Biyara, but this story has been debated by scholars.\nThe Edomite site excavated at the top of the Umm el-Biyara mountain at Petra was established no earlier than the seventh century BC (Iron II).\n\nEmergence of Petra\nThe Nabataeans were one among several nomadic Bedouin tribes that roamed the Arabian Desert and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water. Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, theories about them having Aramean roots are rejected by many modern scholars. Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern Arabian tribe. Current evidence suggests that the Nabataean name for Petra was Raqēmō, variously spelled in inscriptions as rqmw or rqm.\nThe Jewish historian Josephus (ca. 37–100 AD) writes that the region was inhabited by the Midianites during the time of Moses, and that they were ruled by five kings, one of whom was Rekem. Josephus mentions that the city, called Petra by the Greeks, \"ranks highest in the land of the Arabs\" and was still called Rekeme by all the Arabs of his time, after its royal founder (Antiquities iv. 7, 1; 4, 7). The Onomasticon of Eusebius also identified Rekem as Petra. Arabic raqama means \"to mark, to decorate\", so Rekeme could be a Nabataean word referring to the famous carved rock façades. In 1964, workmen clearing rubble away from the cliff at the entrance to the gorge found several funerary inscriptions in Nabatean script. One of them was to a certain Petraios who was born in Raqmu (Rekem) and buried in Garshu (Jerash).\n\nAn old theory held that Petra might be identified with a place called sela in the Hebrew Bible. Encyclopædia Britannica (1911) states that the Semitic name of the city, if not Sela, would remain unknown. It nevertheless cautioned that sela simply means \"rock\" in Hebrew, and thence might not be identified with a city where it occurs in the biblical text in the book of Obadiah. It is possible that the city was part of the nation of Edom.\nThe passage in Diodorus Siculus (xix. 94–97) described the Nabataeans at the time as a nomadic group of people who believed that those who owned possessions could be easily compelled by those who held power, this would drastically change as the centuries went on.\nThis text further describes the expeditions which Antigonus sent against the Nabataeans in 312 BC, was understood by some researchers to throw some light upon the history of Petra, but the \"petra\" (Greek for rock) referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper name, and the description implies that there was no town in existence there at the time.\n\nRoman period\nIn 106, when Aulus Cornelius Palma Frontonianus was governor of Roman Syria, the part of the Arabian Peninsula under the rule of Petra was absorbed into the Roman Empire as part of Arabia Petraea, and Petra became its capital. The native dynasty came to an end but the city continued to flourish under Roman rule. It was around this time that the Petra Roman Road was built. A century later, in the time of Severus Alexander, when the city was at the height of its splendor, the issue of coinage came to an end. There was no more building of sumptuous tombs, owing apparently to some sudden catastrophe, such as an invasion by the Sasanian Empire.\nMeanwhile, as Palmyra (fl. 130–270) grew in importance and attracted the pre-Islamic Arab trade away from Petra, the latter declined. It appears, however, to have lingered on as a religious center. Another Roman road was constructed at the site. Epiphanius of Salamis (c.315–403) writes that in his time a feast was held there on December 25 in honor of the virgin Khaabou and her offspring Dushara. Dushara and al-Uzza were two of the principal deities of the city, which otherwise included many idols from other Nabataean deities such as Allat and Manat.\nBetween 111 and 114, Trajan built the Via Traiana Nova, running from the Syrian border to the Red Sea through Petra. This road followed the old routes of Nabataean caravans. In the shadow of the Pax Romana, this route revived trade between Arabia, Syria, and Mediterranean harbors. In 125 AD, one of Emperor Hadrian's administrators left marks in Petra, pointed out by documents found at the Dead Sea. In 130, Hadrian visited the former Nabataean capital, giving it the name of Hadriānī Petra Metropolis, imprinted on his coins. His visit, however, did not lead to any boom in development and new buildings as it did in Jerash. The province's governor, Sextius Florentinus, erected a monumental mausoleum for his son near the end of the al-Hubta (King's Wall) tombs, which had been generally reserved during the Nabataean period for the royal family.\nRoman emperors' interest in the city in the 3rd century suggests that Petra and its environs remained highly esteemed for a long time. An inscription to Liber Pater, a god revered by Emperor Septimius Severus, was found in the temenos of the temple known as Qasr al-Bint, and Nabataean tombs contained silver coins with the emperor's portrait as well as pottery from his reign. Emperor Elagabalus declared Petra to be a Roman colony, when he reorganized the Roman Empire towards the end of the 3rd century. The area from Petra to Wadi Mujib, the Negev, and the Sinai Peninsula were annexed into the province of Palaestina Salutaris. The Madaba Map from the reign of Emperor Justinian I is missing the section that would include Petra.\n\nByzantine period\nPetra declined rapidly under Roman rule, in large part from the revision of sea-based trade routes. In 363, an earthquake destroyed many buildings and crippled the vital water management system. The old city of Petra was the capital of the Byzantine province of Palaestina III and many churches from the Byzantine period were excavated in and around Petra. In one of them, the Byzantine Church, 140 papyri were discovered, which contained mainly contracts dated from 530s to 590s, establishing that the city was still flourishing in the 6th century. The Byzantine Church is a prime example of monumental architecture in Byzantine Petra.\nThe last reference to Byzantine Petra comes from the Spiritual Meadow of John Moschus, written in the first decades of the 7th century. He gives an anecdote about its bishop, Athenogenes. It ceased to be a metropolitan bishopric sometime before 687 when that function had been transferred to Areopolis. Petra is not mentioned in the narratives of the Muslim conquest of the Levant, nor does it appear in any early Islamic records.\n\nCrusaders and Mamluks\nIn the 12th century, the Crusaders built fortresses such as the Alwaeira Castle, but were forced to abandon Petra after a while. As a result, the location of Petra was lost until the 19th century\nTwo further Crusader-period castles are known in and around Petra: the first is al-Wu'ayra, situated just north of Wadi Musa. It can be viewed from the road to Little Petra. It is the castle that was seized by a band of Turks with the help of local Muslims and only recovered by the Crusaders after they began to destroy the olive trees of Wadi Musa. The potential loss of livelihood led the locals to negotiate a surrender. The second is on the summit of el-Habis, in the heart of Petra, and can be accessed from the West side of the Qasr al-Bint.\nThe ruins of Petra were an object of curiosity during the Middle Ages and were visited by Baibars, one of the first Mamluk sultans of Egypt, towards the end of the 13th century.\n\n19th and 20th centuries\nThe first European to describe them was the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt during his travels in 1812. At that time, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem operated a diocese in al-Karak named Battra (Arabic: باطره, Ancient Greek: Πέτρας) and it was the opinion among the clergy of Jerusalem that Kerak was the ancient city of Petra.\nBurckhardt already spoke Arabic fluently, and was on his way to explore the Niger River when he heard stories of a dead city that held the tomb of the Prophet Aaron, and became fascinated with finding the city. He then dressed himself up as a local, and only spoke in Arabic, bringing a goat with him with the intent of sacrificing it in honor of Aaron's Tomb. After one day of exploring, he was convinced that he had found the lost city of Petra.\nLéon de Laborde and Louis-Maurice-Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds made the first accurate drawings of Petra in 1828. The Scottish painter David Roberts visited Petra in 1839 and returned to Britain with sketches and stories of the encounter with local tribes, published in The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia. Frederic Edwin Church, the leading American landscape painter of the 19th century, visited Petra in 1868, and the resulting painting El Khasné, Petra is among his most important and well-documented. Missionary Archibald Forder published photographs of Petra in the December 1909 issue of National Geographic.\n\nBecause the structures weakened with age, many of the tombs became vulnerable to thieves, and many treasures were stolen. In 1929, a four-person team consisting of British archaeologists Agnes Conway and George Horsfield, Palestinian physician and folklore expert Tawfiq Canaan and Ditlef Nielsen, a Danish scholar, excavated and surveyed Petra.\nThe archaeologist Philip Hammond from the University of Utah visited Petra for nearly 40 years. He explained that the local folklore says it was created by the wand of Moses, when he struck the rock to bring forth water for the Israelites. Hammond believed the carved channels deep within the walls and ground were made from ceramic pipes that once fed water for the city, from rock-cut systems on the canyon rim.\nIn the 1980s, the Bedul Bedouin, once inhabitants of Petra, were relocated by the Jordanian government to the nearby settlement of Umm Sayhoun, a process spanning two decades. This move was part of broader initiatives aimed at settling Bedouin communities and promoting tourism in Petra. With a name meaning \"the changing ones\" and oral traditions recounting a conversion narrative, the Bedul Bedouins are believed to have adopted Islam later in their history, possibly with Jewish or Nabatean origins. Today, alongside their traditional activities, they engage in local tourism, alongside the more prominent Liyathnah tribe.\nNumerous scrolls in Greek and dating to the Byzantine period were discovered in an excavated church near the Temple of the Winged Lions in Petra in December 1993.\n\n21st century\nIn December 2022, Petra was hit by heavy flooding.\n\nLayout\nPetra is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.\nExcavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificial oasis. The area is visited by flash floods, but archaeological evidence shows that the Nabataeans controlled these floods by the use of dams, cisterns, and water conduits. These innovations stored water for prolonged periods of drought and enabled the city to prosper from its sale.\nIn ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra, around Jabal Haroun (\"Aaron's Mountain\"), the location of the Tomb of Aaron, said to be the burial place of Aaron, brother of Moses. Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north. Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east. The impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge, in places only 3–4 m (10–13 ft) wide, called the Siq (\"shaft\"), a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the sandstone rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into Wadi Musa.\n\nHellenistic architecture\nPetra is known primarily for its Hellenistic architecture. The facades of the tombs in Petra are commonly rendered in Hellenistic style, reflecting the number of diverse cultures with which the Nabataeans traded, all of which were in turn influenced by Greek culture. Most of these tombs contain small burials niches carved into the stone.\nPerhaps the best example of the Hellenistic style is seen in the Treasury, which is 24 meters (79 ft) wide and 37 meters (121 ft) tall and refers to the architecture of Alexandria. The facade of the Treasury features a broken pediment with a central tholos inside, and two obelisks appear to form into the rock at the top. Near the bottom of the Treasury are the twin Greek gods Castor and Pollux, who protect travellers on their journeys. Near the top of the Treasury, two victories are seen standing on each side of a female figure on the tholos. This female figure is believed to be the Isis-Tyche, Isis and Tyche being the Egyptian and Greek goddesses, respectively, of good fortune.\nAnother prime example of Hellenistic architecture featured in Petra is its Monastery, which stands at 45 meters (148 ft) tall and 50 meters (160 ft) wide; this is Petra's largest monument and is similarly carved into the rock face. The facade of this again features a broken pediment, similar to the Treasury, as well as another central tholos. The Monastery displays more of a Nabataen touch while at the same time incorporating elements from Greek architecture. Its only source of light is its entrance standing at 8 meters (26 ft) high. There is a large space outside of the Monastery, which is purposefully flattened for worship purposes. Formerly, in the Byzantine period, this was a place for Christian worship, but is now a holy site for pilgrims to visit.\n\nCity centre\nAt the end of the narrow gorge, the Siq, stands Petra's most elaborate ruin, popularly known as Al-Khazneh (\"the Treasury\"), hewn into the sandstone cliff. While remaining in remarkably preserved condition, the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local Bedouin tribes that hoped to dislodge riches that were once rumoured to be hidden within it.\nA little farther from the Treasury, at the foot of the mountain called en-Nejr, is a massive theatre, positioned so as to bring the greatest number of tombs within view. At the point where the valley opens out into the plain, the site of the city is revealed with striking effect. The theatre was cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs during its construction. Rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible. Almost enclosing it on three sides are rose-coloured mountain walls, divided into groups by deep fissures and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers. The theatre  was said to hold around 8,500 people. The performances that audiences were able to attend here were poetry readings and dramas. Gladiator fights were also said to be held here and attracted the most audience, although no gladiator was able to gain any momentum or fame due to the heavy mortality rate that came with it. The theatre was one of many structures in Petra that took significant damage due to the 363 Galilee earthquake.\n\nThe Petra Pool and Garden Complex is a series of structures within the city center. Originally said to be a market area, excavations at the site have allowed scholars to identify it as an elaborate Nabataean garden, which included a large swimming pool, an island-pavilion, and an intricate hydraulic system.\nAhead of the Petra Pool and Garden Complex lies Colonnaded street, which is among few artifacts of Petra that was constructed rather than natural. This street used to hold a semi-circle nymphaeum, which is now in ruins due to flash flooding, and used to hold Petra's only tree. This was intended to be a symbol for the peaceful atmosphere that the Nabataens were able to construct in Petra. Once the Romans took control of the city, Colonnaded street was narrowed to make room for a side walk, and 72 columns were added to each side.\n\nHigh Place of Sacrifice\nThe High Place of Sacrifice is perched atop Jebel Madbah Mountain. The beginning of the hike is near Petra's theatre. From there, the site of The High Place of Sacrifice is around an 800-step hike. One commonly believed sacrifice that took place there was libation. Another common form of sacrifice that took place there was animal sacrifice; this is due to the belief that the tomb of the Prophet Aaron is located in Petra, which is a sacred site for Muslims. In honor of this, a goat was sacrificed annually. Other rituals also took place there, including the burning of frankincense.\n\nRoyal Tombs\nThe Royal Tombs of Petra are in the Nabatean version of Hellenistic architecture, but their facades have worn due to natural decay. One of these tombs, the Palace Tomb, is speculated to be the tomb for the kings of Petra. The Corinthian Tomb, which is right next to the Palace Tomb, has the same Hellenistic architecture featured on the Treasury. The two other Royal Tombs are the Silk Tomb and the Urn Tomb; the Silk Tomb does not stand out as much as the Urn Tomb. The Urn Tomb features a large yard in its front, and was turned into a church in 446 AD after the expansion of Christianity.\n\nExterior platform\nIn 2016, archaeologists using satellite imagery and drones discovered a very large, previously unknown monumental structure whose beginnings were tentatively dated to about 150 BC, the time when the Nabataeans initiated their public building programme. It is located outside the main area of the city, at the foot of Jabal an-Nmayr and about 0.5 mi (0.8 km) south of the city centre, but is facing east, not towards the city, and has no visible relationship to it. The structure consists of a huge, 184 by 161 ft (56 by 49 m) platform, with a monumental staircase along its eastern side. The large platform enclosed a slightly smaller one, topped with a comparatively small building, 28 by 28 ft (8.5 by 8.5 m), which was facing east toward the staircase. The structure, second in size only to the Monastery complex, probably had a ceremonial function of which not even a speculative explanation has yet been offered by the researchers.\n\nGeostrategic importance\nPliny the Elder and other writers identify Petra as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom and the centre of their caravan trade. Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a perennial stream, Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress, but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to Gaza in the west, to Bosra and Damascus in the north, to Aqaba and Leuce Come on the Red Sea, and across the desert to the Persian Gulf.\n\nReligious importance\nNabataean religion\nThe Nabataeans worshipped Arab gods and goddesses during the pre-Islamic era as well as a few of their deified kings. One, Obodas I, was deified after his death in 85 BC. Dushara was the primary male god accompanied by his three female deities: Al-‘Uzzā, Allat and Manāt. Many statues carved in the rock depict these gods and goddesses. New evidence indicates that broader Edomite, and Nabataean theology had strong links to Earth-Sun relationships, often manifested in the orientation of prominent Petra structures to equinox and solstice sunrises and sunsets.\n\nThe Monastery, Petra's largest monument, dates from the 1st century BC. It was dedicated to Obodas I and is believed to be the symposium of Obodas the god. This information is inscribed on the ruins of the Monastery (the name is the translation of the Arabic Ad Deir).\nThe Temple of the Winged Lions is a large temple complex dated to the reign of King Aretas IV (9 BC–40 AD). The temple is located in Petra's so-called Sacred Quarter, an area situated at the end of Petra's main Colonnaded Street consisting of two majestic temples, the Qasr al-Bint and, opposite, the Temple of the Winged Lions on the northern bank of Wadi Musa.\n\nLate Roman and Byzantine-period Christianity\nChristianity found its way to Petra during the 4th century AD, nearly 500 years after the establishment of Petra as a trade centre, and the city was gradually converted over the course of the 4th century and possibly into the early 5th century AD. The start of Christianity in Petra started primarily in 330 AD when the first Christian emperor of Rome took over, Constantine I, otherwise known as Constantine the Great. Together with Licinius, he issued a decree of tolerance which stopped the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire.  Athanasius mentions a bishop of Petra (Antioch. 10) named Asterius. At least one of the tombs (now known as the \"Urn Tomb\") was used as a church. An inscription in red paint records its consecration \"in the time of the most holy bishop Jason\" (447).\n\nEarly Muslim and Crusader periods\nAfter the  Muslim conquest of 629–632, Christianity in Petra, as of most of Arabia, gave way to Islam.\nIn the wake of the First Crusade, part of Transjordan including Petra was conquered by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem and formed the second fief of the barony of Krak (in the lordship of Oultrejordain) with the title Château de la Valée de Moyse or Sela. It remained in the hands of the Franks until 1189. It is still a titular see of the Catholic Church - see Archbishop of Petra and List of Catholic titular sees: Petra in Palaestina.\n\nTraditional connection to Moses, Aaron and Miriam\nAccording to a tradition, Petra is the spot where Moses (Musa in Arabic) struck a rock with his staff and water came forth, and where Moses' brother, Aaron (Harun in Arabic), is buried, at Mount Hor, known in Arabic as Jabal Haroun, 'Mount Aaron'. Placing the death of Aaron on a mountain peak near Petra dates back to at least the time of Josephus (see Antiquities IV. 4, 7). A memorial church built in the saddle under the peak in the 5th century became the nucleus of a monastery frequented by pilgrims, named in a document from among the Petra papyri and dated to 573 as \"the House of ... High Priest Aaron.\" Wadi Musa or the \"Wadi of Moses\" is the Arabic name for the narrow valley at the head of which Petra is sited.\nA mountaintop shrine of Moses' sister Miriam was still shown to pilgrims at the time of Jerome in the 4th century, but its location has not been identified since.\n\nClimate\nIn Petra, there is a semi-arid climate. Most rain falls in the winter. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification is BSk. The average annual temperature in Petra is 15.5 °C (59.9 °F). About 193 mm (7.60 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nConservation\nThe Bedul (Petra Bedouin) were forcibly resettled from their cave dwellings in Petra to Umm Sayhoun/Um Seihun by the Jordanian government in 1985, prior to the UNESCO designation process. They were provided with block-built housing with some infrastructure including in particular a sewage and drainage system. Among the six communities in the Petra Region, Umm Sayhoun is one of the smaller communities. The village of Wadi Musa is the largest in the area, inhabited largely by the Layathnah Bedouin, and is now the closest settlement to the visitor centre, the main entrance via the Siq and the archaeological site generally. Umm Sayhoun gives access to the 'back route' into the site, the Wadi Turkmaniyeh pedestrian route.\nOn December 6, 1985, Petra was designated a World Heritage Site. In a popular poll in 2007, it was also named one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. The Petra Archaeological Park (PAP) became an autonomous legal entity over the management of this site in August 2007.\n\nThe Bedoul belong to one of the Bedouin tribes whose cultural heritage and traditional skills were proclaimed by UNESCO on the Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2005 and inscribed in 2008.\nIn 2011, following an 11-month project planning phase, the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority in association with DesignWorkshop and JCP s.r.l published a Strategic Master Plan that guides planned development of the Petra Region. This is intended to guide planned development of the Petra Region in an efficient, balanced and sustainable way over the next 20 years for the benefit of the local population and of Jordan in general. As part of this, a Strategic Plan was developed for Umm Sayhoun and surrounding areas.\nThe process of developing the Strategic Plan considered the area's needs from five points of view:\n\nA socio-economic perspective\nThe perspective of Petra Archaeological Park\nThe perspective of Petra's tourism product\nA land use perspective\nAn environmental perspective\nThe site suffers from a host of threats, including collapse of ancient structures, erosion due to flooding and improper rainwater drainage, weathering from salt upwelling, improper restoration of ancient structures, and unsustainable tourism. The last has increased substantially, especially since the site received widespread media coverage in 2007 during the New 7 Wonders of the World Internet and cellphone campaign. Tourism has steadily grown, with Petra receiving 1.2 million total visitors in 2019.\nIn an attempt to reduce the problems, the Petra National Trust (PNT) was established in 1989. It has worked with numerous local and international organisations on projects that promote the protection, conservation, and preservation of the Petra site. Moreover, UNESCO and ICOMOS recently collaborated to publish their first book on human and natural threats to the sensitive World Heritage sites. They chose Petra as its first and the most important example of threatened landscapes. The presentation Tourism and Archaeological Heritage Management at Petra: Driver to Development or Destruction? (2012) was the first in a series to address the very nature of these deteriorating buildings, cities, sites, and regions.\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) released a video in 2018 highlighting the abuse of working animals in Petra. PETA claimed that animals are forced to carry tourists or pull carriages every day. The video showed handlers beating and whipping working animals, with beatings intensifying when animals faltered. PETA also showed some wounded animals, including camels with fly-infested, open wounds. The Jordanian authority running the site responded by proposing a veterinary clinic, and by undertaking to spread awareness among animal handlers. In 2020, more video released by PETA indicated that conditions for the animals had not improved and, in 2021, the organization was running what appeared to be the only veterinary clinic in the area.\n\nPetra is a site at the intersection of natural and cultural heritage forming a unique cultural landscape. Ever since Johann Ludwig Burckhardt aka Sheikh Ibrahim had re-discovered the ruin city in Petra, Jordan, in 1812, the cultural heritage site has attracted different people who shared an interest in the ancient history and culture of the Nabataeans such as travellers, pilgrims, painters and savants. However, it was not until the late 19th century that the ruins were systematically approached by archaeological researchers. Since then regular archaeological excavations and ongoing research on the Nabataean culture have been part of today's UNESCO world cultural heritage site Petra. Through the excavations in the Petra Archaeological Park an increasing number of Nabataean cultural heritage is being exposed to environmental impact. A central issue is the management of water impacting the built heritage and the rock hewn facades. The large number of discoveries and the exposure of structures and findings demand conservation measures respecting the interlinkage between the natural landscape and cultural heritage, as especially this connection is a central challenge at the UNECSO World Heritage Site.\nIn recent years different conservation campaigns and projects were established at the cultural heritage site of Petra. The main works first focussed on the entrance situation of the Siq to protect tourists and to facilitate access. Also, different projects for conservation and conservation research were conducted. Following is a list of projects, to be continued.\n\n1958 Restoration of the third pillar of the Treasury building (Al-Khazneh).

It played a prominent role in the Marcus Didius Falco mystery novel Last Act in Palmyra, and is the setting for Agatha Christie's Appointment with Death. In Blue Balliett's novel Chasing Vermeer, the character Petra Andalee is named after the site.\nIn 1979 Marguerite van Geldermalsen from New Zealand married Mohammed Abdullah, a Bedouin in Petra. They lived in a cave in Petra until the death of her husband.

          "summary": "Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء‎, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα, lit. 'Rock'), originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu (Nabataean Aramaic: 𐢛𐢚𐢒‎ or 𐢛𐢚𐢓𐢈‎, *Raqēmō), is an ancient city and archaeological site in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also called the \"Rose City\" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved. The city is one of the New 7 Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and was settled by the Nabataeans, a nomadic Arab people, in the 4th century BC. Petra would later become the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom in the second century BC. The Nabataeans invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub, which gained them considerable revenue. Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and thus were able to defend their kingdom. They were particularly skillful in agriculture, stone carving, and rainwater harvesting.\nPetra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants. Nabataea fell to the Romans in 106 AD, who annexed and renamed it Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.\nUNESCO has described Petra as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\". Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Visitor numbers reach close to a million tourists every year.",

          "content": "البتراء أو البترا أو البطراء مدينة أثرية وتاريخية تقع في محافظة معان في جنوب المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية. تشتهر بعمارتها المنحوتة بالصخور ونظام قنوات جر المياه القديمة. أُطلق عليها قديمًا اسم «سلع»، كما سُميت بـ «المدينة الوردية» نسبةً لألوان صخورها الملتوية.\nأُسست البتراء تقريبًا في عام 312 ق.م عاصمة لمملكة الأنباط. وقد تبوأت مكانةً مرموقةً لسنوات طويلة، حيث كان لموقعها على طريق الحرير، والمتوسط لحضارات بلاد ما بين النهرين وفلسطين ومصر، دورًا كبيرًا جعل من دولة الأنباط تمسك بزمام التجارة بين حضارات هذه المناطق وسكانها. وتقع المدينة على منحدرات جبل المذبح، بين مجموعة من الجبال الصخرية الشاهقة، التي تُشكل الخاصرة الشمالية الغربية لشبه الجزيرة العربية، وتحديدًا وادي عربة، الممتد من البحر الميت وحتى خليج العقبة.\nبقي موقع البتراء غير مكتشف للغرب طيلة الفترة العثمانية، حتى أعاد اكتشافها المستشرق السويسري يوهان لودفيغ بركهارت عام 1812. وقد أُدرجت مدينة البتراء على لائحة التراث العالمي التابعة لليونسكو في عام 1985. واختيرت إحدى عجائب الدنيا السبع الجديدة عام 2007.\nوتُعد البتراء اليوم، رمزًا للأردن، وأكثر الأماكن جذبًا للسياح على مستوى المملكة. كما أنها واحدة من أهم الوجهات السياحية لزعماء العالم. ولقد احتفلت المدينة بالزائر رقم مليون لأول مرة في تاريخ السياحة الأردنيّة، وذلك في شهر تشرين الثاني/ نوفمبر 2019.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع مدينة البتراء في لواء البتراء التابع لمحافظة معان، على بعد 225 كيلومتر جنوب العاصمة الأردنية عمّان، وإلى الغرب من الطريق الصحراوي الذي يصل بين عمّان ومدينة العقبة على ساحل خليج العقبة. يقع اللواء في الجهة الغربية من مدينة معان مركز المحافظة، ويبعد عنها 36 كم. ويتواجد على امتداد سلسلة جبال الشراة المطلة على وادي عربة وطبيعتها الجغرافية المنحدرة والمحاطة بالجبال. تبلغ مساحة اللواء 900 كم2 ، أما مساحة المحمية الأثرية فتبلغ 264 كم2. وتُعتبر البتراء أحد مناطق هذا اللواء، ومركزه مدينة وادي موسى.\nتتميز مدينة البتراء بأنها مدينة محفورة في الحجر الرملي الملون في صخور جبال وادي موسى الوردي، ولذا سُميت بـ «المدينة الوردية». ويمكن للزائر أن يصل إليها بواسطة السيارة وبعدها يبدأ في السير بين جنبات مدينة ضخمة محفورة في الصخر، ومختبئة خلف حاجز منيع من الجبال المتراصة التي بالكاد يسهل اختراقها يطلق عليه اسم السيق.\n\nالجيولوجيا\nمن أهم المظاهر الجيولوجية في مناطق البتراء؛ التكشفات الصخرية والتي تبين معظم الفترات والعصور والأعمار على السلم الجيولوجي، لتأثر المنطقة بعمليات تكتونية ناجمة عن حركة انفتاح وتوسع صدع البحر الميت، حيث تتكشف صخور القاعدة الجرانيتية في وادي نملة شمال غرب منطقة بيضاء البترا، والتي تعود إلى فترات ما قبل الكامبري بعمر 650 مليون سنة.\nتمتاز منطقة البتراء بتكشفات الصخور الرسوبية والرمال التي تتكون من فتات معادن الفلدسبار وغيرها والتي تعود للعصر الكامبري والأوردوفيشي، حيث ترسّبت في بيئات نهرية أدت إلى نقلها وترسيبها آنذاك، ومن ثم وللأعلى تتكشف مباشرة صخور العصر الكريتاسي وبوجود عدم توافق ترسيبي يفسر بعمليات؛ زوال صخور عصور معروفة كالسيلوري والجوراسي وانقطاع في الترسيب في تلك العصور. توجد أيضا تراكيب جيولوجية مثالية كالصدوع والطيات، والمقاطع الجيولوجية المثالية التي تتجمل بألوان زاهية، إضافة الينابيع والكهوف الطبيعية، والأحافير الممثلة لكافة العصور الجيولوجية. من أهم التراكيب الجيولوجية في البترا هي؛ صدع وادي موسى، حيث تأثرت المنطقة بصدع رأسي اتجاهه شمال- جنوب؛ وهو أحد الصدوع الرئيسية في جنوب الأردن. وتعمل سلطة إقليم البترا على التمهيد من أجل إطلاق مشروع السياحة الجيولوجية من خلال التعاون مع سلطة المصادر الطبيعية الأردنية، وتعد هذه التجربة الأولى من نوعها في المملكة.\n\nالحياة البرية\nينتشر شجر العرعر الفينيقي في البتراء كونها امتدادا لمناطق تواجده في المشرق العربي. وهو نوع نباتي شجري من جنس العرعر يتبع الفصيلة السروية.\nتقع البتراء في جنوب بلاد الشام، حيث وادي عربة وصحراء النقب. تعيش في هذه البيئات أنواع عشبية حولية ومعمرة. توجد كثير من الأنواع البصيلية والدرنية مثل العنصل والبلفية (باللاتينية: Bellevalia) من الفصيلة الهليونية والعصفلدين من الفصيلة الزانثورية. وتوجد عدة أنواع من الحثرة (باللاتينية: Boerhavia) ومن الصدح (باللاتينية: Commicarpus) من الفصيلة الشّبّيّة (باللاتينية: Nyctaginaceae).\n\nتتميز منطقة النقب ببعض الأنواع التي تعد امتداداً للغطاء النباتي في إفريقيا. من هذه الأنواع العشار الباسق (باللاتينية: Calotropis procera) وأربعة أنواع من السنط أحدها السنط الملتوي (باللاتينية: Acacia tortilis). كذلك، توجد أجناس نباتية تتواجد في معظم البيئات الشامية المذكورة أعلاه مثل السوسن الذي ينتشر منه أكثر من ثلاثين نوعًا تتوزع على مختلف مناطق الشام حسب تأقلم كل نوع منها. كذلك ينتشر أكثر من خمسين نوعًا من جنس الثوم (الفصيلة الثومية) وأربعين من القنطريون (الفصيلة النجمية) في مناطق الشام المختلفة من مرعش إلى سيناء وسبعة وثلاثون نوعا من الأربيان من الفصيلة النجمية.\nأما بالنسبة للحيوانات، فيعيش في البتراء كل من الجمال والخيول والماعز والحمير لتحملها حرارة الأجواء ولتكيفها مع بيئتها الجافة.\n\nالمناخ\nالتاريخ\nيعود الفضل في بناء البتراء إلى الأنباط، إلا أنه قبل الأنباط كان يعيش في هذه المنطقة شعب يدعى الآدوميين الذين كانوا في حالة عداء دائم مع الدول المجاورة لهم. وقد استوطن الأدميون التلال المحيطة بالبتراء من 1200 – 539 ق. م ولم يدخلوا البتراء بل فضّلوا الأقامة على التلال المحيطة بها، ولم يكن لديهم المام أو اهتمام بالنحت أو البناء في الصخر، بل كانت براعتهم محصورة في صناعة الفخاريات التي يبدو أنهم نقلوها إلى العرب الأنباط الذين استقروا في هذه المنطقة بعد هجرتهم من الجزيرة العربية في نهاية القرن السادس قبل الميلاد. لقد احتل الآدوميون جزءاً هاماً من المنطقة التي كانت عند تقاطع عدة طرق تجارية مهمة واستفادوا كثيرًا من القوافل التجارية التي كانت تمر عبر طرقهم. ويُعتقد بأن الآدوميين قد هزمهم اليهود بقيادة الملك سليمان الذين بسطوا سيطرتهم على هذه المنطقة لمدة مائتي عام. بعد ذلك قام البابليون بغزو فلسطين، وأخذوا اليهود وأخذوهم أسرى. وبدأ الآدوميون الذين طُردوا من هذه المنطقة بالتحرك لإعادة احتلال الأراضي التي كانت فيما مضى خاضعة لسيطرتهم. ومع ذلك فقد اجتاح الأنباط هذه المنطقة مرة أخرى وهم قبيلة بدوية ينحدرون من أصول عربية. تعايش الأنباط مع الأدوميين في حياة أكثر استقرارًا.\n\nالعرب الأنباط\nكانت البتراء عاصمة لدولة الأنباط وأهم مدن مملكتهم العربية التي دامت ما بين 400 ق.م وحتى 106 م، وقد امتدت حدودها من ساحل عسقلان في فلسطين غربًا وحتى صحراء بلاد الشام شرقًا، ومن الشمال دمشق وحتى البحر الأحمر جنوبًا. في عام 300 قبل الميلاد، كان الأنباط قد حققوا السيطرة التامة على المنطقة، وبنوا لأنفسهم مستعمرة حضرية، حيث قاموا بنحت أحيائهم السكنية ومبانيهم وقبورهم في الصخور بجانب الجبال. وفي أوج ازدهارهم في القرن الأول قبل الميلاد كان يعيش في مدينة البتراء مايقارب 30,000 نسمة، كان يحكمهم ملك منذ العام 168 قبل الميلاد وأنشأوا دولة تمثل ديمقراطية، حيث كان الملك عرضة للمحاسبة عن كل أفعاله.\nشكل موقع البتراء المتوسط بين حضارات بلاد ما بين النهرين وبلاد الشام والجزيرة العربية ومصر أهمية أقتصادية، فقد أمسكت دولة الأنباط بزمام التجارة بين حضارات هذه المناطق وسكانها وكانت القوافل التجارية تصل إليها محملة بالتوابل والبهارات من جنوب الجزيرة العربية والحرير من غزة ودمشق والحناء من عسقلان والزجاجيات من صور وصيدا واللؤلؤ من الخليج العربي.\n\nكان الأنباط في البتراء يتكلمون لغة تشبه الآرامية. وقد أصبحت البتراء عاصمة ثقافية موازية ومساوية للمدن الفينيقية واليونانية، حيث يُعتقد أن الخط العربي الأبجدي قد نشأ وتطور في هذه المنطقة، على يد الأنباط العرب. كما كُتب به الحرف العبري في مرحلة ما. وقد انتشر الحرف النبطي بعد أن تبناه الإسلام، وكُتبت به لغات أمم أخرى في بلاد عدة لا يقل مجموعها عن خمسة عشر. لقد أنتج الأنباط أواني فخارية جميلة، ومباني عظيمة تأثر معظمها فيما بعد بالأسلوب الروماني. في بداية القرن الأول الميلادي، أصبحت مدينة البتراء مركز التجارة مجدداً بسبب الحروب الدائمة بين مصر وسورية. وخلال وقت قصير، أصبح الأنباط أثرياء وأقوياء بما في الكفاية ليبسطوا سيطرتهم على المنطقة. ولكونهم زادوا ثراءً تحسن أسلوب حياتهم، وهو ما انعكس بدوره على الديكورات الفخمة الموجودة على قبور الأنباط الجدد.\nاستطاع العرب الأنباط في البدايات، مقاومة محاولات السيطرة عليهم وإخضاعهم، وأبقوا منطقة دائرة الأردن التاريخية خالية نسبيا من النفوذ الأجنبي. ومن بين أهم مواجهاتهم العسكرية، وقوفهم في وجه النفوذ السلوقي (اليوناني) في عام 312 ق.م. إذ استطاعوا رد الجيش اليوناني مهزومًا بعد أن قتلوا معظم أفراده في الحملة الأولى، وردوا الحملة اليونانية الثانية بعد أن حاصر الإغريق مدينتهم لمدة طويلة. كذلك انتصر الأنباط في أول معركة بحرية يخوضها جيش عربي، وذلك في مياه البحر الميت، وهي المعركة التي أنهت أحلام اليونان وأطماعهم بالاستيلاء على شرق الأردن. كما واجه العرب الأنباط اليهود في مواجهات واسعة سجلوا في معظمها الانتصار رغم الحماية الرومانية التي كانوا يتمتعون فيها.\n\nالرومان والبيزنطيون\nغزا الجنرال الروماني بومباي المملكة النبطية في نحو عام 60 قبل الميلاد، إلا أنه سمح بقدر من الحكم الذاتي فيها. ولقد كانت نهاية دولة الأنباط على يد الرومان عندما حاصروها ومنعوا عنها مصادر المياه سنة 106، حتى ضموها لإمبراطوريتهم، وأطلقوا عليها اسم مقاطعة \"Arabia Petraea\"، وعاصمتها البتراء.\nوكان الأنباط قد حققوا أرباحًا كبيرة من التجارة الرومانية والهندية والعربية على أراضيهم. إلا أن استيلاء الرومان على البتراء جعلهم يسيطرون على هذه الطرق. وقد بدأ الرومان ببناء وتشييد أبنيتهم الخاصة في البتراء وأقاموا في المدينة مدرجاً، كما قاموا بتشييد معبد قصر البنت، وهو البناء الوحيد الذي ما زال قائماً في قلب المدينة حيث كان يقع السوق الكبير. وفي هذا المكان كانت القوافل تقايض القوافل الأخرى القادمة من الغرب بالتوابل والعاج والعنبر والقماش. استمرت البتراء مركزًا تجاريًا مهمًا لمدة قرنين آخرين من الزمن. وبعد ذلك تضاءلت أهميتها مع استمرار بعض المدن في الشمال مثل تدمر بجذب التجارة إليها. وبالتدريج غادر التجار وغادرت معهم جيوش الرومان التي كانت مهمتها حماية الطرق التجارية. وبعد تحول الإمبراطورية الرومانية إلى الديانة المسيحية، حظيت البتراء بمطرانية، وتحولت بعض أبنيتها إلى كنائس. لكن المدينة التي حكمها البيزنطيون، فقدت مجدها السابق ولم يتبق منها إلا الأطلال. ويبدو أن المسيحية قد دخلت البتراء قبل وخلال الفترة المبكرة من العصر البيزنطي، رغم انتشار الوثنية جنبًا إلى جنب معها، حيث كانت الكنائس والمعابد الوثنية موجودة حتى القرن الخامس.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nأصبح من تبقى من سكان البتراء يعتاشون على الزراعة قبل وصول الإسلام للشام، وتحديدًا في سنة 636، لكن الزلزال الذي ضربها سنة 746 و 748 وزلازل أخرى قامت بإفراغها من أهلها. وقد ورد ذكر منطقة البتراء وجوارها في المصادر التاريخية المعاصرة للحروب الصليبية. وتشير هذه المصادر إلى أن وادي موسى كانت منطقة خصبة، وبها مياه وفيرة، كما تشير الوثائق التي تعود لهذه الفترة إلى وجود كنيسة في منطقة جبل هارون. وقد قام الصليبيون بحملة عسكرية على البتراء ووادي موسى تألفت من الفرسان والمشاة في نهاية عام 1100 وبقيادة ملك الفرنجة بالدوين الأول. وقد شيّدوا فيها قلعتين بعد ذلك. كما بنى المماليك مقاما للنبي هارون في البتراء على جبل يرتفع 1353 متر عن سطح البحر، في سياق اهتمامهم بالمقامات والقبور. ولكن المدينة دخلت في سبات طويل في الفترة العثمانية، وحتى إعادة اكتشافها في عام 1812.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nمع بدء رحلات المستشرقين للوطن العربي في القرن التاسع عشر، اكتشف البتراء عام 1812م المستشرق السويسري يوهان لودفيغ بركهارت، الذي تعلم اللغة العربية ودرس الإسلام في سوريا وجاء إلى البتراء مدعيًا بأنه مسلم من الهند بعد أن تنكّر بزي إسلامي، وهدفه تقديم أضحية إلى النبي هارون؛ وبذلك سمح له السكان المحليون بالدخول إلى المدينة الوردية. وقد احتوى كتابه المطبوع عام 1828 والمعروف باسم «رحلات في سوريا والديار المقدسة» على صور للبتراء.\nتطورت أهمية البتراء إداريًا مع نشوء إمارة شرق الأردن في عام 1921، حيث تأسست مديرية ناحية في وادي موسى. وفي عام 1973 رفعت الوحدة الإدارية من ناحية إلى قضاء. في عام 1996 رُفعت إلى لواء. في عام 2001 تغير اسم لواء وادي موسى إلى لواء البتراء. وتعتبر مدينة وادي موسى مركز اللواء.\nنفًّذت مديرية المصادر التراثية الأردنية 22 حفرية أثرية مع عدد من البعثات الغربية اُنجزت في منطقتيّ البترا والبيضا. وقد وُضعت مدينة البتراء منذ عام 1985 ضمن قائمة اليونسكو لمواقع التراث العالمي، نظرًا لتفرد المدينة من الناحية الطبيعية والتاريخية والجغرافية، ولاحتوائها على مزيج فريد من تراث الحضارات القديمة التي تنتمي إلى حضارات متنوعة يذكر منها آثار الآدوميين، واليونانيين، والأنباط، والرومان، والبيزنطيين، والصليبين، والمماليك. ومنذ ذلك التاريخ عقدت عدة ورش عمل، عنيت بترميم وحماية آثار البتراء. وتأسست في عام 1992 اللجنة الوطنية لحماية البتراء في المجلس الأعلى للعلوم والتكنولوجيا، وقامت جمعيات غير حكومية أعلنت برامج في هذا المجال. وقد وصل عدد زوار البتراء الإجمالي في عام 2010 إلى 900,000 زائر، مقتربًا من الطاقة الاستيعابية القصوى لمحمية البتراء الأثرية والبالغة 1.13 مليون\nزائر حسب تقديرات منظمة اليونسكو.\nوقد اختيرت البتراء في 7 تموز/ يوليو 2007 ثانية عجائب الدنيا السبع الجديدة، بعد الدعم الرسمي للتصويت، حيث اُعتبر الأمر واجبًا وطنيًا. وقامت الحكومة الأردنية بحملات دعائية ضخمة من أجل البتراء في الصحف الأردنية والإذاعة الأردنية والتلفزيون الأردني لتحفّز مواطني المملكة على التصويت. وبدأت الشركات بإطلاق الحملات لدعم التصويت.\nكما تأسس في البتراء عام 2009، سلطة ذات استقلال مالي وإداري، هي سلطة إقليم البترا التنموي السياحي. والتي تهدف إلى تنمية الإقليم وتطويره سياحيًا واقتصاديًا واجتماعيًا وثقافيًا، والمساهمة في تنمية المجتمع المحلي.\n\nالعمارة\nتأثرت العمارة النبطية عمومًا، وعمارة البتراء خصوصًا، بفن العمارة المصرية والآشورية والإغريقية. ويظهر هذا جلّيًا في كثير من مباني العمارة الجنائزية المتمثلة بالمقابر الملكية المنحوتة، والمقابر المبنية بالحجر المقطوع. لقد اهتم الأنباط اهتمامًا كبيرًا بمقابرهم، مما إنعكس في عمارتها التي حُشد فيها الكثير من الفنون المعمارية والفنية ومما يوحي باهتمام الأنباط «بالحياة الآخرة» بالنسبة للأموات. وبالنسبة للمقابر الملكية المنحوتة، فتُعتبر من أكثر ما أشتهر به الأنباط. وقد أُجريت عليها العديد من الدراسات المتخصصة أظهرت أن المهندس النبطي جمع بين التأثيرات الخارجية من الحضارات المجاورة مع الذوق النبطي. ويمكن مشاهدة الكثير من هذه القبور في أماكن مختلفة من البتراء وما حولها وخصوصًا في الطريق قبل الوصول إلى السيق. من قبور البتراء الشهيرة: قبر «المسلات» وقبر «الجرة» و «القبر ذو النوافذ».\nتتسم عمارة الأنباط باستخدم العديد من المواد حسب توفرها في البيئة، فبالإضافة إلى نحت الصخور الرملية والكلسية وجعلها مساكن ومنشآت وقبور وتماثيل وغيرها، فقد استخدمت كل أنواع الحجارة في البناء النبطي حيثما فرضت البيئة ذلك، ففي الصحراء مثلا، جرى استخدام الحجارة البازلتية السوداء لمختلف أغراض البناء. وفي معظم الأبنية الكبيرة كالمعابد استخدمت فنون معمارية كثيرة منها الأقواس الكبيرة والصغيرة التي تعتمد على تراص الحجارة لا على المونة أو الدعم الأرضي بالأعمدة، وفي بعض الحالات جرى سقف بعض الأبنية أو الحجرات بصفوف متلاصقة من هذه الحجارة قبل أن تجري تغطيتها بالملاط الطيني من فوقها لدرء أمطار الشتاء ولعزل حرارة الصيف أيضًا. وبالنسبة للمواد الأخرى المساعدة، فقد استخدمت الأخشاب في التسقيف وصناعة الأبواب والشبابيك، ويبدو ذلك في منطقة وادي موسى والبتراء بسبب توفر الأشجار في المنطقة. وعرف الأنباط استخداما آخر للأخشاب في البناء من شأنه تعزيز صمود الجدران أمام الهزات الأرضية، حيث عثر على بقايا تلك الأخشاب في بعض الأبنية منها بناء «قصر البنت» في البتراء.\nمن جهة أخرى، يُعتبر النظام الهندسي للماء الإنجاز الأهم للحضارة النبطية بالمدينة، والذي جعل الحياة ممكنة في هذه المنطقة الجافة من الصحراء الأردنية. وقد تضمن ذلك النظام أنظمة لحفظ المياه واشتمل على السدود التي كانت تجمع مياه الأمطار في أشهر الشتاء. كما استخدم الأنباط نظاماً محكماً من القنوات والأنابيب الفخارية لتوزيع المياه في كافة أنحاء المدينة.\nالتخطيط الحضري\n\nلقد بُنيت مباني البتراء وفق مخطط المدينة العام، حيث الشارع الرئيس الذي تأثر بمخطط المدينة الرومانية، إذ أن الشارع يكاد يقسم المدينة إلى نصفين، وهو يحاذي الوادي مما اضطر المهندس النبطي لبناء بعض القنوات تحت أرض الشارع. وكذلك العبارات والأقواس الحجرية التي ترتفع عن سيل الوادي في فصل الشتاء. وما يزال بالإمكان ملاحظة بعض آثار هذه المرافق في الشارع الرئيسي بعد الانتهاء من ساحة الخزنة.\nيُعد الشارع المُعمد من أهم شوارع مدينة البتراء، حيث قام الأنباط بتشييده، ثم أعاد الرومان بنائه في عام 106 بعد احتلالهم للبتراء. يبلغ عرضه 6 أمتار، وقد كانت تقوم على جانبيه مباني من طابق واحد إلى طابقين، كما يوجد على يسار الشارع المعمد باتجاه الجنوب مجموعة من السلالم تقود لساحة مكشوفة تسمى بـ «السوق»، حيث كانت تجري كافة أنواع النشاطات والمعاملات التجارية. وعلى ما يبدو أن هذه المنطقة كانت القلب النابض للمدينة ومركز النشاطات التجارية المختلفة منذ القرن الثالث ق.م. وقد استمر استعمال الشارع خلال الفترة البيزنطية في القرنين الرابع والخامس وحتى السادس.\nيوجد في المدينة أيضًا أحد الطرق المشهورة، وهو شارع الواجهات. ويقع بالقرب من منطقة الخزنة، حيث يبدأ السيق بالاتساع تدريجيًا حيث يصل الزوار إلى منطقة مفتوحة وعلى الجانبين يوجد عددًا من واجهات المدافن النبطية المزينة بالمسننات والكورنيشات والأدراج المقلوبة. ولقد دُمر بعض هذه الواجهات بفعل العوامل الطبيعية، وربما تعود هذه الواجهات إلى موظفين كبار في الدولة أو بعض الأمراء.\n\nالمواقع الأثرية داخل البتراء\nاكتشف نحو 3,000 معلم أثري في البتراء، تشكل منها المعالم المعروفة نحو 800 معلمًا، أهمها:\n\nالسيق\nهو الطريق الرئيس المؤدي لمدينة البتراء. وهو شق صخري يتلوّى بطول نحو 1200 متر وبعرض يتراوح من 3 - 12 متر، ويصل ارتفاعه إلى نحو 80 متر. يُعتبر الجزء الأكبر منه طبيعي، بالإضافة إلى جزء آخر نحته الأنباط. ينتهي السيق في الجهة المقابلة للخزنة.\nيُمكن مشاهدة بقايا لقوس يمثل بوابة المدينة في بداية السيق، الذي يوجد على جانبيه قنوات لجر المياه ممتدة من عيون وادي موسى في الخارج إلى المدينة في الداخل. كما يمكن مشاهدة السدود الجانبية، التي أقيمت في مكان السدود النبطية الأصلية، لمنع تدفق المياه إلى السيق، وحجزها والاستفادة منها. لقد كانت أرضية السيق مبلطة ببلاطات حجرية جزء منها يمكن مشاهدته في مكانه الأصلي. وقد زُينت جوانب السيق بالمنحوتات النبطية ومعظمها منحوتات تمثل آلهة. وتوجد تماثيل الآلهة ومحاريبها قريبة جداً من هذه القنوات بل وملاصقة لها أحيانا، لاعتقاد الأنباط وإيمانهم الشديد بأن المياه مقدسة.\nيمكن أيضا مشاهدة مجموعة من المنحوتات على الجانب الأيسر من السيق تُعرف باسم «أصنام سابينوس»، وقد سُمّيت هذه المجموعة بهذا الاسم لوجود نقش باليونانية تحت الحنية الثانية على يسار الزائر وهو متجه لآخر السيق. يشير النقش إلى أن سابينوس ابن الإسكندر المقدوني، والذي جاء من درعا، أمر بنحت هذه الحنيات أو المحاريب تمجيداً للآلهة النبطية. ومن المنحوتات المهمة أيضا بقايا منحوتات لجمال ورجل تمثل قافلة تجارية، حيث اشتهر الأنباط بالتجارة، وكانت أحد أسباب ثرائهم الواسع.\n\nالخزنة\nيُعتبر مبنى الخزنة المنحوتة في الصخر، أشهر معالم البتراء وأكثرها أهمية، حيث اختار الأنباط موقعها بعناية ليكون أول معلم يواجه الزائر بعد دخول المدينة. وقد سُمّيت بهذا الاسم لاعتقاد البدو المحليين سابقًا بأن الجرة الموجودة في أعلى الواجهة تحوي كنزًا، ولكنها في الواقع ضريح ملكي. تتكون واجهة الخزنة من طابقين بعرض 25 مترا وارتفاع 39 مترا. وقد أفرغت مئات الآف الأمتار المكعبة من الحجر الرملي من الخزنة عندما أُعيد اكتشافها في القرن التاسع عشر، لتظهر الواجهة بوضعها النهائي الحالي. ويتكون الطابق السفلي من ستة أعمدة على طول الواجهة الأمامية تقف فوق مصطبة في وسطها سلم، وتتوج الأعمدة من الأعلى بثلاثة أرباع عمود، يبلغ طول العمود في الطابق السفلي نحو 12 مترا، وفي الطابق العلوي يبلغ ارتفاعه 9 أمتار، كما يبلغ ارتفاع الجرة في الأعلى نحو 3,5 مترا.\nويظهر التناظر الكبير في الواجهة، بالإضافة إلى المزيج بين الفنون المعمارية المصرية والهلنستية مع الطابع المعماري النبطي. وحول هدف إنشاء هذا المبنى عدة آراء، فيرى بعض علماء الآثار أنه بُني معبدًا أو مكان لحفظ الوثائق، ولكن الحفريات الأثرية الحديثة في البتراء أثبتت وجود مدافن أسفل ساحة مبنى الخزنة، والتي يمكن مشاهدتها الآن من الأعلى من خلال الشبك الحديدي الموجود فوقها. كما أن هذه المدافن قُطعت لبناء الخزنة مع المحافظة عليها. وبذلك تكون الخزنة مدفنا. ويثبت مع القرن الأول الميلادي زمن الملك الحارث الرابع ملك الأنباط. وعلى الأغلب تشكل مدفناً لهذا الملك.\nويتكون مبنى الخزنة من الداخل من ثلاث حجرات، اثنتان على الجانب وواحدة في الوسط. والحجرتان الجانبيتان خاليتان عدا عن قبر حفر في الحجرة الغربية، أما الحجرة الوسطى فيصعد إليها بدرج ويبلغ طولها 12,5 متر، وعلى جوانبها الثلاث توجد حجرات صغيرة للدفن. ويوجد على جانبي مبنى الخزنة من الخارج ثقوب صغيرة على الجانبين مزدوجة في النصف الأعلى من مبنى الخزنة ربما تكون استخدمت لتثبيت السقالات أثناء عملية النحت. ويوجد في أعلى مبنى الخزنة قناة بعرض 90 سم لتصريف المياه ومنعها للنزول على هذه الواجهة. وقد قامت الحفريات الحديثة بتنظيف هذه القناة.\n\nالدير\nوهو من المباني المهمة في منطقة البتراء، ويعود تاريخه إلى النصف الأول من القرن الأول قبل الميلاد، ويتكون المبنى من طابقين، ويُعتقد أنه احتوى على تماثيل متحركة التيجان. وهو أكبر حجماً من مبنى الخزنة، حيث يصل عرضه إلى 50 مترا، أما ارتفاعه فيصل إلى 50 مترا.\nويُعتقد أن واجهة مبنى الدير قد حُوِّلت إلى دير للرهبان أثناء فترة حكم الدولة البيزنطية في بلاد الشام، وذلك لوجود أثار للصلبان المحفورة في الصخر في الغرفة الوحيدة الموجودة في الطابق السفلي من الواجهة. كما يُعتقد بأنه الساحة الواقعة أمام الواجهة قد بُلّطت.\n\nمسرح البتراء\nمن أكبر المباني في البتراء، ولقد بُني في القرن الأول للميلاد على شكل نصف دائرة بقطر 95 مترا، وبارتفاع 23 مترا. وهو منحوت في الصخر بإستثناء الجزء الأمامي منه فهو مبني، ويستوعب المسرح من 7 - 10 آلاف مشاهد، كما تتكون مقاعد المشاهدين من 45 صفًا من المقاعد المقسمة أفقيًا إلى ثلاثة أقسام، الأسفل 11 صفا والأوسط 34 صفا والعلوي 10 صفوف، وهي مقسمة أيضًا من خلال الأدراج الخمسة إلى ستة أجزاء، ويوجد فوق المدرجات قطع صخري مقطوع من بعض المدافن السابقة لبناء المسرح.\nقطعت ساحة الأوركسترا بالصخر، كما أن الممران الجانبيان للساحة مقطوعان أيضًا في الصخر ومسقفان بالحجارة على شكل عقد. أما الجدار الخلفي للمسرح فيتكون بالأصل من 3 طوابق ومزيّن بالكوات والأعمدة وواجهته مغطاة بالألواح الرخامية.\n\nقصر البنت\nيُطلق عليه أيضًا «قصر بنت فرعون»، وهو معبد نبطي من القرن الأول قبل الميلاد. وتكمن أهمية هذا القصر بأنه أحد مباني البتراء القليلة التي صمدت رغم الزلازل، وذلك بسبب طريقة بنائهِ باستخدام مداميك وضع فيها خشب العرعر، مما جعل جدرانه أكثر طواعية للحركة أثناء الزلازل. إن الحنية التي تقع على يمين الساحة الأمامية لقصر البنت كانت قد صممت أصلا لتخليد الإمبراطور الروماني وعائلته عندما احتل الرومان مدينة البتراء، حيث أن هذا التقليد معروف عند الرومان.\nوقد كان هذا المعبد مخصصًا لواحدة من الآلهة الرئيسية، ويجادل البعض أن هذه الآلهة هي اللات فيما يعتقد آخرون أنها العزى، ورأى آخرون أنه للإله الأعلى ذو الشرى. وكان من المثير للنقاش علاقة هذا المعبد بالإلهة إيزيس المعبودة المصرية، وكان ذلك من الظواهر المستغربة.\n\nالمحكمة\nهو مبنى متكون من مجموعة من الواجهات المهمة، وأولها «قبر الجرة»، ويعود تاريخه إلى النصف الأول من القرن الأول الميلادي، ويقع على الجهة المقابلة للمدرج النبطي. ويبلغ عرض الواجهة نحو 16 مترا، وبارتفاع 26 مترا. وتتكون من طابقين من الجدران التي تدعم أقواسًا تحت مستوى صالة المدفن، وهي مدمجة مع حجرات دفن جزء منها منحوت والآخر مبني. ويوجد سلم يصعد إلى ساحة المدفن في الأعلى. ويتكون المدفن من صالة مربعة الشكل بطول نحو 19 مترا. وكانت القبور في الجزء الخلفي للمدفن، ولكنه حُول إلى كنيسة في القرن الخامس الميلادي. وتوجد كتابة يونانية تذكر أن تحويل المكان إلى كنيسة عام 447 ومكتوب ذلك على الجزء الخلفي الأيسر من الجدار.\n\nالمعبد الكبير\nوهو أضخم المباني في مدينة البتراء، ويقع هذا المعبد على الجهة الجنوبية من الشارع المُعمد. ويتكون البناء من مدخل رئيسي يرتبط مع الشارع، ثم ساحة مقدسة سفلى وعلى جانبيها يوجد بنائين متطابقين على شكل نصف دائري وعلى جانبيهما توجد أدراج عريضة تؤدي إلى الساحة العليا المقدسة، وفوقها يقع المعبد أو قدس الأقداس.\n\nالمذبح\nاُستخدم هذا المبنى في فترة الصليبيين ليكون صلة وصل وربط ما بين قلعتي الوعيرة والحبيس. أما المذبح نفسه، فأصوله آدومية. وبعد الاحتفالات التي كانت تجرى في المدرج كانت المواكب الدينية تصعد إلى المذبح من المنطقة المجاورة للمدرج مرورًا بوادي المحافر حتى تصل للمذبح حيث تقدم القرابين التي كانت حيوانية والمذبح يتكون من ساحة مركزية محاطة بمقاعد من ثلاث جهات. إن أول ما يمكن رؤيته في هذه المنطقة هو مسلتان مقطوعتان في الصخر ويعتقد بأنهما يرمزان لأهم آلهة الأنباط ذو الشرى ورفيقته الدائمة العزى. كما يُشاهد في منطقة الدرج الصاعد للمذبح بقايا جدران وبرج يُعتقد بأن أساساته آدومية أعيد استخدامه في الفترة النبطية. ويوجد في الجهة الغربية مذبحين أحدهما مستطيل الشكل ربما استخدم لعملية الطواف، والآخر دائري الشكل يُعتقد أنه كان يستخدم لوضع دماء القرابين أو النبيذ كما يحتوي هذا المعلم على بركة أو خزان ماء صغير ويمكن مشاهدة الجزء السفلي للمدينة من هذا الموقع.\n\nمواقع أخرى\nيوجد المدينة الكثير من المعالم الأخرى ذات الوظائف المختلفة، منها ضريح الجندي الروماني وقاعة الاحتفالات الجنائزية. ويعتقد بوجود ساحة مركزية بين هذين المعلمين. أما القاعة الجنائزية فقد تميزت عن غيرها بوجود دعامات منحوتة وملتصقة بالجدران وحنى مستطيلة طولية الشكل خلف المقاعد مباشرةً، أما ضريح الجندي الروماني فربما اُعيد استخدامه بعد 106 م وذلك لوجود ثلاثة تماثيل ذات رداء عسكري روماني موضوعة في حنايا هذه الواجهة.\nكما تحوي البتراء عددًا من المعابد الصغيرة في البتراء مثل معبد الأسود المجنحة، ومعبد البستان. بالنسبة لمعبد الأسود المجنحة، فيقع على الجهة المقابلة لمبنى قصر البنت، ويتكون بناء المعبد من شرفة أمامية تتقدمها الأعمدة بطول 9,5 متر. ويجري الدخول منها عبر بوابة عريضة إلى قاعة المعبد الرئيسية وهي مربعة الشكل وتحيط بها الأعمدة. وكانت تاجيات بعض أعمدة المعبد تحمل أسودًا مجنحةً ومن هنا جاءت تسمية المعبد. وقد بُلطت أرضية القاعة الرئيسة برخام أبيض مموج بالبني بينما بلطت المنصة بالرخام الأبيض والأسود وزخرفت جدران المعبد الداخلية بالرخام والقصارة الملونة والجض وعثر على قطع جصية بأشكال رؤوس آدمية وأقنعه مسرحية وأشكال أزهار كانت مثبته على الجدران. وقد دُمر المعبد والمنشآت المحيطة به بزلزال عام 363 م. أما بالنسبة لمعبد البستان، فيتميز بوجود جدار ضخم بجواره يقوم عليه الجزء الجنوبي للشرفة العلوية وبقايا غرف يبدو أن إحداها كانت معقودة يتخلل جدرانها إحدى عشر حنية.\nومن المباني الجنائزية الأخرى في المدينة، قبر المسلات، مدفن الحرير، مدفن سكستوس فلورنتينوس، قبر القصر، القبر الكورنثي،  وقبر الرينيسانس.\n\nالسكان\nبلغ عدد سكان لواء البتراء (الذي تشكل مدينة البتراء جزءاً منه) في عام 2009 نحو 28,760 نسمة، معظمهم من البدو. وكانت قبائل من «عرب اللياثنة» قد استوطنت المكان أثناء إعادة اكتشاف الغرب للبتراء في القرن التاسع عشر. كما كانت عشائر مختلفة تسكن البتراء منذ خمسينيات القرن العشرين، كعشائر «العمارين» و «البدول»، حيث كانوا يسكنون في كهوف داخل البتراء حتى عام 1985، حين رحّلتهم الحكومة الأردنية إلى إسكانات خارج المدينة الأثرية كبلدة «البيضاء» التي تبعد عن البترا نحو 10 كم. ويُقدر عددهم من 1,000 - 3,000 شخص يتقن الكثير منهم العديد من اللغات الأجنبية رغم أميّة الكثير منهم، بسبب اختلاطهم بالسيّاح الأجانب.\nوقد أدرج المجال الثقافي لبدو البتراء ووادي رم في 25 تشرين الثاني/ نوفمبر 2005 إلى قائمة اليونسكو لروائع التراث الثقافي اللامادي الإنساني. ويقع هذا المجال البدوي الصحراوي قرب مدينة البتراء، داخل منطقة جبلية شبه قاحلة ومساحات صحراوية. وهو مجال تمارس فيه مجموعة من الممارسات والمهارات الثقافية اللامادية، المرتبطة بالحياة الرعوية التقليدية. فقد حافظ بدو البتراء ووادي الرم على معرفة مميزة في مجال الثروة النباتية والحيوانية، وفي حقل الطب التقليدي، وتربية الجمال وحياكة الخيام والترحال وتسلّق الجبال. وهو ما يقع تناقله عبر الأجيال شفويا وبالممارسة. بالإضافة إلى غيرها من الأشكال الثقافية كالأساطير والشعر والحكايات الشعبية والأغاني.\n\nالنشاط الاقتصادي\nشكّل معدن النحاس، عصب الحياة الاقتصادية وعنصرًا هامًا في تدعيم نفوذ وقوة حضارة الأنباط. وامتدت أراضي المملكة النبطية عبر مساحات واسعة، فكان تحت نفوذها أراضي وادي ضانا، حيث أقيم أقدم مناجم للنحاس في العالم، وهي مناجم النحاس في وادي فنان. إضافة إلى صناعة الفخار، حيث يعتبر الفخار النبطي من أفضل وأدق الفخار الذي صنع في العالم، لما عرف من منظر وإتقان. وهو رقيق جدًا لدرجة أنه يُطلق عليه «قشرة البيض».\n\nوقد اشتهر الأنباط بالتجارة، وكانت مدينة البتراء محط استراحة للقوافل التجارية. وهذا ما جعل أنتيجونوس - أحد قادة الإسكندر المقدوني - بغزو الأنباط في عام 312 ق.م. ومع مرور الزمن أصبح الأنباط يتمتعون بكيان ونفوذ كبيرين في المنطقة وأزدهر فن المعمار والبناء وسك العملات وصناعة الفخار وفنون النحت وغيرها. وتعكس عاصمتهم مدينة البتراء تلك الفنون في أجمل صورها.\n\nاستطاع الأنباط تطوير طرق الزراعة الجافة والحصاد المائي، مما يعكس قدرة الإنسان النبطي على التكيف مع ظروف الحياة الجافة وتطويع الطبيعة، ففنون الزراعة الجافة وطرق الحصاد المائي ما زالت مستخدمة حتى الوقت الحاضر، ومما يجدر ذكره أن العديد من العلماء الغربين استطاعوا نقل التقنيات النبطية القديمة والمستخدمة في الزراعة الجافة والحصاد المائي ويرجع الفضل بهذا حقيقة إلى الأنباط.\nأما حاليًا، فتُعتبر البتراء أهم المواقع السياحية جذبًا للسياح على مستوى الأردن، وبذا لها عائد اقتصادي كبير على البلاد. كما تشكل البتراء اليوم، عمق الأردن الحضاري، وجانبًا هامًا من مضمون مزيج الهوية التاريخية لهذا البلد. كما تحتل هذه المدينة التاريخية اليوم، المرتبة الأولى أردنيًا من حيث خلق العمالة المحلية ومنطقة جذب سياحي للمشاريع المحلية المدرة للدخل ومنطقة جذب للقطاع الخاص، كما أنها شكلت فئة متوسطة بالنسبة للبيئة والمشاريع الحكومية.\n\nالسياحة\nتضم البتراء عددًا كبيرًا من الفنادق ذات تصنيف خمس نجوم وما دون لاستيعاب الأعداد الكبيرة من الزائرين لمحمية الآثار في المدينة، حيث بلغ عددهم قرابة 480,000 زائر في عام 1999، فيما ارتفع العدد إلى 900,000 عام 2010. كما تحوي هذه المحمية بدورها على عدد كبير من الأسواق الشرقية. من الجدير بالذكر أن جرش تلي مدينة البتراء من حيث عدد الزوار، تليهما كل من المناطق التالية تنازليًا: عجلون ومادبا والكرك وأم قيس ووادي رم. في عام 2019، احتفلت المدينة باستقبال الزائر رقم مليون لأول مرة في تاريخها، في حدث اعتُبر محطة فارقة في مسيرة السياحة الأردنية. وقد نُظمت فعاليات احتفالية بهذه المناسبة.\nمن جهة أخرى، افتتح في نيسان/ أبريل 1994 متحف البتراء النبطي في المدينة إلى جانب متحف آخر هو متحف البتراء القديم، الذي تأسس عام 1963. ويحتوي المتحف النبطي ما يقارب 600 قطعة أثرية معروضة في خزائن العرض؛ حيث يتألف من ثلاث قاعات رئيسية: القاعة الأولى تشتمل شرحاً عن تاريخ الأنباط وجيولوجية البتراء، بالإضافة إلى قطع أثرية تعود إلى العصر الحجري الحديث. أما القاعة الثانية، فهي مخصصة للمكتشفات من الحفريات الأثرية، ومرتبة حسب تسلسلها الزمني بدءاً من العصرالحجري وحتى القرن السادس الميلادي. كما تضم هذه القاعة نبذة تاريخية عن الزلازل والتجارة النبطية وطرق القوافل والبتراء في العصور الوسطى. أما القاعة الثالثة، فتحتوي على مجموعة من الأسرجة الفخارية حسب تطور صناعتها، والتماثيل البرونزية والفخارية والأطبـاق الملونة والعادية وقطع العملات، والحلي والمجوهرات، بالإضافة لبعض القطع الفخارية والجرار المختلفة الأحجام.\nيُقام في البتراء سنويًا ومنذ عام 2005، مهرجان البتراء السياحي الثقافي، لتشجيع السياحة الداخلية والعربية. كما أُقيم في نفس العام مؤتمر للحائزين على جائزة نوبل في العالم. ولقد قامت سلطة إقليم البترا بالتعاون مع هيئة تنشيط السياحة في عام 2012، بإحياء احتفاليات تضم العديد من الأنشطة والفعاليات، بمناسبة مرور 200 عامًا على اكتشاف البتراء، والتي تهدف إلى تعريف المواطن المحلي والسائح العربي والأجنبي بأهمية هذه المناسبة ودورها الريادي في وضع البتراء على خارطة السياحة العالمية.\n\nأهمية دينية\nللمدينة أهمية دينية وتاريخية للديانات الإبراهيمية الثلاث. يعتقد اليهود أنها تحتوي على أهم وأثمن سر في تاريخهم، وهو تابوت العهد، الذي يحتوي على الوصايا العشر التي أعطاها الله لموسى، بالإضافة إلى وجود عصا هارون فيه. يوجد مقام هارون في البتراء وعلى أحد قممها المطلّة على المدينة الأثرية بارتفاع 1353 متر عن سطح البحر، مقام النبي هارون . وهو مسجد مملوكي صغير، ذو غرفة مُزينة بأقمشة خضراء تعلوها قبة بيضاء وأمامه حجر أسود. بُني المقام في سياق اهتمام المماليك بالمقامات والقبور. كما يدعي بعض اليهود أنهم هم من بنو البتراء، حيث يعتقدون أن التوراة قد أشارت إلى أن من انشأ هذه المدينة هم سلالة النبي «نابوت» الابن الأكبر للنبي إسماعيل. كما يعتقدون أن اسم البتراء القديم «سالع» هو كلمة عبرية معناها «صخرة»، حيث إنها تُرجمت في العدد الثالث من نبوة عوبديا: «تكبر قلبك قد خدعك أيها الساكن في محاجئ الصخر». ويرجحون أنها حيثما تذكر في التوراة، فإنها تشير إلى عاصمة أدوم، المدينة الحصينة في وادي موسى التي اشتهرت باسم «البتراء» (والتي تعني «صخرة» باللغة اليونانية). وبقد بدأ اليهود بزيارة البتراء بشكل ملحوظ، بعد إتفاقية وادي عربة.\nمن جهة أخرى، ذُكر مقام هارون بالبتراء أيضًا في مخطوطات الكنيسة البيزنطية التي تعود إلى القرن السادس الميلادي باسم «دير نبينا هارون»، حيث يوجد في المدينة آثار لعدد من الكنائس البيزنطية ذات الأرضيات الفسيفسائية. وتُعتبر كنيسة البتراء الرئيسية، ثاني كنيسة في البتراء بعد تحويل قبر الجرة (المحكمة) لكنيسة في عام 446. وتتكون الكنيسة من مبنى ذو 3 أروقة، بالإضافة إلى ساحة وبرج من الجهة الغربية وغرف جانبية من الشمال والشرق.\nكما كان أهالي وادي موسى المسلمون يقومون بزيارة المقام منذ زمن بعيد، حيث كان للمكان طقوسا ومناسك تُؤدى. وقد زار الظاهر بيبرس وكاتبه النويري المقام سنة 1276، ولم يتحدث النويري عن وجود بناء فوقه. أما اليوم، فيشهد فوقه مسجدًا صغيرًا كُتب على مدخله عبارة تفيد أنه عمارة هذا المسجد قد جددت في عهد السلطان الملك الناصر محمد بن قلاوون. وقد زار المقام الرحّآلة السويسري بيركهارت عام 1812 عندما أراد أن يزور البتراء ، فتذرّع بزيارة المقام وأخذ معه قربانًا ليتمكن من زيارة البتراء. ثم ذهل مما رآه عندما دخل البتراء من السيق.\n\nالبتراء في الفن\nأصبح المجتمع الغربي على علم بوجود البتراء أساسًا من خلال قصص جون وليام برغن الدينية، حين وصفها بأنها «مدينة وردية قديمة بقدم الزمن». لكنه نفسه، مثل كثير من معاصريه، لم يقوموا بزيارة البتراء أبدًا. حيث كانوا يعلمون عن البتراء عبر رسومات الليثوغرافيا التي رسمها الفنان الإسكتلندي ديفيد روبرتس للبتراء ومنطقة وادي موسى أثناء زيارته عام 1839، والتي تجاوز عددها عشرين لوحة ليثوغرافية. وقد طبع العديد منها ما أعطى البتراء شهرة عالمية . وقد نشرها في كتابه «مصر وسوريا وفلسطين» في عام 1839. في الواقع، حتى الحرب العالمية الأولى، لم تكن زيارة المدينة متاحة للأوروبيين إلا برفقة مرشدين محليين ومرافقين مسلحين . ويوجد للبتراء العديد من اللوحات والصور الأخرى التي تعود للقرن التاسع عشر مما يدل على مدى الاهتمام الذي أضفاه إعادة اكتشافها على أوروبا في ذلك الوقت. من الأعمال المشهورة للبتراء، لوحة فنية بالألوان المائية لمناظر البتراء للفنان شرانز نحو 1840 . وأول خارطة مخطوطة للبتراء باللغة الإنجليزية من رسم الرحالة لابودي نحو عام 1830، وصور من تصوير فريت عام 1830.\nفي عام 1868، شُكلت قافلة من الرسامين الفرنسيين للذهاب إلى سيناء والفيوم والبتراء، لكن النتيجة كانت مخيبة للآمال، حيث منعتهم الأمطار الغزيرة من إكمال رحلتهم. كتب الفنان البلجيكي تانتان Tintin كتابًا مصورًأ عن البتراء، ولكن موقع الصور لم يكن فيه الأردن، حيث كان في دولة افتراضية أسماها \"Khemed74\".\nوقد احتفت الكثير من المسرحيات والأعمال الدرامية الأردنية والعربية بالبتراء، كان من أهمها مسرحية بترا، التي ألّفها الأخوان رحباني، وغنتها فيروز ونصري شمس الدين وآخرين.\nكما اختيرت البتراء موقعًا لتصوير عدد من الأفلام الأمريكية والعالمية مثل أفلام إنديانا جونز والحملة الأخيرة (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) والعاطفة في الصحراء (Passion in the Desert) والمتحوّلون (Transformers)، وغيرها.\n\nتوأمة المدن\nماتيرا، إيطاليا\n بلوفديف،

          "content": "## Overview\nPetra (Arabic: البتراء, Al-Batrāʾ), the fabled \"rose red city, half as old as time\", is a well known ancient Nabataean city in the south of Jordan. Due to its breathtaking grandeur and fabulous ruins, Petra was recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985.\n\n## Understand\nPetra was the impressive capital of the Nabataean Kingdom from around the 6th century BC. The kingdom was absorbed into the Roman Empire in AD 106 and the Romans continued to expand the city. An important center for trade and commerce, Petra continued to flourish until a catastrophic earthquake destroyed buildings and crippled vital water management systems around AD 663. After Saladin's conquest of the Middle East in 1189, Petra was abandoned and the memory of it was lost to the West.\nThe ruins remained hidden to most of the world until the Swiss explorer, Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, disguised as an Arab scholar, infiltrated the Bedouin-occupied city in 1812. Burckhardt's accounts of his travels inspired other Western explorers and historians to discover the ancient city further. The most famous of these was David Roberts, a Scottish artist who created a number of accurate and detailed illustrations of the city in 1839.\nThe first real excavations of the site were in 1929 after the forming of Trans-Jordan. Since that time, Petra has become by far Jordan's largest tourist attraction, partially due to the exposure by the Steven Spielberg movie, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, in 1989. Due to the fantastic engineering accomplishments and the fact of its being well-preserved, the archaeological site was chosen in July 2007 as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.\nPetra is the archaeological site and Wadi Musa is the city nearby.\n\n## Hours\nPetra is open to visits 06:00-17:00 in winter, and 06:00-18:00 in summer, daily throughout the year.\n\n## Entry ticket\nWhat may be one of the most expensive admissions to any archaeological site in the world. The entry ticket to Petra costs 90 JD for one day visitors to Jordan (i.e., those that have arrived in Jordan from some other country, e.g. Israel, on the day of the visit and will be returning there for the night). Tourists that overnight in the country or on a cruise ship pay 50 JD for 1 day, 55 JD for 2 days or 60 JD for 3 days. Bring your passport to prove you entered Jordan at least one day before. If entered the same day, your room key will be asked by the ticket seller. Students have to pay the full price, except those who enroll in a Jordanian university, for whom the admission price drops sharply to 1 JD.\nDo not attempt to purchase tickets from dubious scalpers around town! Time permitting, the two-day pass is recommended, as there is much to see and do in Petra. For more than one day, the ticket office can ask for your passport as the ticket has your first name on it.\nThe Jordan Pass (purchased online before coming to Jordan) gives you access to over 30 sights and attractions in Jordan, including Petra, Wadi Rum Protected Area and Jerash. And the fee on the regular 40 JD visa is waived when entering Jordan, if you stay at least four days in the country. (If you leave before, you will have to pay the 40 JD at the border when exiting.) There are three different types available, depending on the length of your stay in Petra: 70, 75, or 80 JD for one, two, or three days in Petra. Also read Jordan#Jordan Pass.\nChildren under 12 years can enter the touristic sites for free when accompanied by their parents.\n\n## By bus\nJETT buses, both ordinary and all-inclusive guided tour, connect to Amman and Aqaba via the fast (but boring) Desert Highway. Other tourists come with organized groups, including daily trips from Eilat, Israel. Tours to Petra from the Egyptian cities of Taba, Sinai and Sharm el Sheikh are also gaining popularity with charter tourism.\nIt is easy to take the bus from Amman to Petra. It leaves from the JETT bus office close to Abdali station (departs at 06:30, runs daily) and in 3½ hours you'll get to the bus station not even 5 minutes from the entrance of Petra. You can also take it at the 7th Circle at around 6:45. At 17:00 the JETT bus takes off again to go back to Amman. The price is 10 JD for one way (as of May 2025).\n\n## By minibus\nThe 30.31895235.479451 Wadi Musa Bus Station is next to the mosque.\nPublic minibus from Wadi Musa (Petra) to Ma'an (or vis versa) is 0.55 JD and from there to Aqaba (or vis versa) is 1.50 JD. The main route from Wadi Musa to Aqaba or Amman (or vice versa) is overpriced for tourists! Going through Ma'an, you should be able to pay the local price for the public minibus.\nThere is a direct minibus going from Aqaba for 5 JD, for those that cross from Eilat and don't want to pay the outrageous taxi fare. The problem is, there's no timetable - it leaves early in the morning (06:45) from Wadi Musa towards Aqaba, then returns from Aqaba when it fills up etc. Ask at the tourist information right at the border for information of departures.\nThere are also direct minibuses from Amman - these leave when full, and tourists are charged 7 JD (March 2023) to get on. Do not allow the drivers to charge you for your luggage, as they might sometimes try to do. The ride is about three hours.\nThe minibus from Wadi Rum costs 10 JD. It takes around 2 hours to get to Petra. Have your tour operator or guide call the bus owner the day before to arrange an exact time for pick up. The bus usually leaves from Wadi Rum at 09:30 in the morning, but may be delayed due to weather or tour groups coming the other way.\nThere was a daily bus to Wadi Musa from Madaba, via the scenic (but slow) King's Highway, but as of 2025, it is not running anymore. The Mariam Hotel can however organise a shared taxi for you. The price is 85 JD for the taxi and you will have to find the people that can share it with you.\n\n## By taxi\nTaxi is also a viable option. For 75 JD or less (depending on how much you haggle) you may be able to get a private taxi from Amman to Petra and back, including the driver waiting around for 6 hr.\nA taxi from Aqaba to Petra should cost 55 JD one-way. Though, see the remark on the Aqaba border taxi Mafia under Aqaba.\nRenting a minibus with a driver in the hotel at the Dead Sea would be around 140 JD one-way.\nA taxi from Madaba to Petra arranged by a hotel costs 60-65 JD (Oct 2018). Arranging one directly may cost less.\n\n## By tour company\nMany visitors to Petra come on day trips from Eilat, in Israel. Single day tours cost around US$220 per person, including park admission, but not including Israel border fees (2015). A bus driver picks you up at your hotel around 07:00 and takes you to the Yitzhak Rabin-Aqaba border crossing just outside of Eilat. Once you cross the border, a Jordanian tour guide drives you to Petra, where you spend about 4 hr before having a late lunch and returning to the border around 18:00. Day tours can sometimes be booked at your Eilat hotel after you arrive, but advance reservations are recommended, especially during peak travel times.\n\n## Sneak peek\nIn case you travel on a shoestring or really do not have the money for Petra, there is a way to see parts of Petra without having a ticket. From the highway south of Wadi Musa there leads a track to the top of the mountain that faces the Treasury. You can get some pretty good shots from there. Try OpenStreetMap, which many mobile Apps like OsmAnd or Mapy.cz, use to identify the track or look for an according GPX file for GPS navigation.\n\n## Wadi Musa to Petra\nMany hotels organise free transport to and from the entrance to Petra. Otherwise you can either walk downhill along Tourist Rd. for about 15 minutes, or take a taxi for 1-2 JD.\n\n## Within Petra\nThe only modes of transport allowed within Petra are on two feet or four (camel, donkey, or horse). There are 4 segments within Petra with 4 possible types of transport: from the entrance to the Siq (by foot or horse), from the Siq to the Treasury (by foot or cart), from the Treasury to the stairs of the Monastery (by foot, donkey or camel), the 800 stairs of the monastery (by foot or donkey).\nWhen entering Petra, there is a brief hike down towards the Siq. Horses will be available for travel to the entrance of the Siq. The prices for such rides are not set and are extremely negotiable, depending on one's bargaining abilities. Although the horse guides will tell you that riding a horse to the Siq entrance is included in the ticket price, they will try to sell you a longer tour, and argue aggressively for a 'tip'. As the walk down to the Siq entrance is only 15 min, it's not really worth it. The horses have been treated so badly in the past that a clinic to treat and heal them from the bad treatments they receive has been opened left to the entrance. It's not uncommon to see wounded animals, especially those pulling the carts, to be put to gallop under 37°C.\nDonkeys are exploited by small groups of Bedouin youths who use 75 cm electrical cable sections to strike them all the way up to the Monastery. So if you can walk, it's better to spare the animals.\nThe video in the Petra Museum (just past the security gate and the ticket sales booth) tells visitors not to ride the donkeys because:\nOnce you arrive at the Treasury and throughout Petra, there will be many camel and donkey owners jockeying for your business. Be prepared to do some bargaining and don't pay more than 15 JD per hour. Often there are times when the owner will drop his price in half simply by hearing a few phrases in Arabic.\nCamel transport could be an option. Riding a camel is a unique experience along the Main Trail.\nMuch of Petra is literally covered in feces from all of the animals, and it has a near-perpetual smell—especially in narrow areas like the Siq and the tombs that are full of animal (and human) feces. Please don't fund the exploitation of animals that's destroying this World Heritage Site and making it an unpleasant visit for others.\n\"Free with ticket\" scam: Even though it might state on your ticket that the horse/donkey transport from the entrance to the Siq is included in the price, it is a common way to scam people into paying unjustified amounts of money for the guides service. Some guides with horses and donkeys will offer you to carry you further, but many people ended up paying 50 JD for a two-hour ride, which is beyond fair and justified. Don't fall for any such lies and simply reject any offer. If you really want to use their service, agree on an all-inclusive price for animal, guide and any other services beforehand and only hand over the money at the finish. Do not get tricked into extra tracks, services or anything these scammers could charge you for.\nHowever, if you are reasonably fit and the weather is good, walking the whole of Petra is quite nice. Prefer climbing the Monastery's path before 15:00, otherwise it will be mostly in the shadow. If you are a good hiker, Petra area including the Monastery climb, the climb up the tombs to see the Treasury from above and even the High Place of Sacrifice are possible on one day.\nThere is an unofficial section from the High Place of Sacrifice directly down to the Treasury, saving you some time, but finding it can be a little tricky. Try OpenStreetMap, which at least shows the official track to its very end. The other way around from the bottom of the Treasury is blocked by a sign and probably official personnel. Not going down to the Treasury, you can even walk back to the highway.\n\"You need a guide\" scam: On some trails (especially an ascent from the Treasury and a walk starting between the entrance and the Siq), touts may falsely tell you that a guide is mandatory and may pursue you (on foot or horseback) to try to force you to turn back. Some routes are officially designated as \"dangerous without a guide\" (though this very much depends on your mobility and the weather), but a guide is not mandatory. On the other hand, some other routes are indeed blocked off, but in that case having a local guide doesn't detract from the fact that you are trespassing. In any case, if hassled, the best thing to do is to try to ignore them. In busy hours, tourist police are often nearby, especially near the Treasury.\n\n## See\nGuides can be hired from about 25 JD and up (depending on what you want to see) at the Visitors Center. Many of them were born and raised in Petra, and will gladly share their knowledge with you. Major hotels can rent you a portable Easyguide audio guide (10 JD/day) for commentary in English, Arabic, French and Spanish. Easyguide is also available as a mobile phone service on all Jordanian mobile phone networks; a map is needed to use this service.\n30.32300635.4564911 Siq. The entrance to Petra is a long, winding sandstone canyon (about 2 km). There are minor carvings spotted here and there throughout the Siq, but the most impressive sights are the colorful and unusual sandstone patterns in the rock walls. There are also remains of terracotta pipes built into the sides of the canyon that were used in Roman times to carry water.\n30.3220635.451452 Treasury (Al-Khazneh in Arabic). Upon exiting the Siq, visitors can view this jaw-dropping grandeur. Be sure to note the urn atop the Treasury structure, it has been rumored that the urn contained a Pharaoh's hidden treasure, and the urn bears the bullet pock marks where Bedouin travellers throughout the years have tested the theory. Get there when the park opens at 06:00 or 06:30 (depending on the season) and you may have the Treasury all to yourself or with fewer than 5-10 people around and no vendors.\n30.32297135.4503033 Street of Facades. Past the next bend is this part also sometimes called outer Siq, a large canyon lined with the facades of various tombs.\n30.32477335.4469624 Nabatean Theatre. At the end of the Street of Facades is the 7000-seat Roman Theater. The theater was created by the Nabateans but later enlarged by the Romans. It is still used for occasional performances.\n30.32658335.4490435 Royal Tombs. On the side of the valley opposite the Roman Theater and a short walk up the hill, are the tombs. The name was given because they are quite grand in scale compared to the others in the area, but it is unclear for whom the tombs were built.\n30.33063935.4443216 Byzantine Church.\n30.32871435.4422847 The Great Temple.\n30.33822835.4309278 Monastery (ad-Deir). The largest carved monument in Petra, dates back to the 1st century AD. The interior, like that of the Treasury, is underwhelming in comparison to the façade. The more than 800 steps up to the Monastery can take over an hour, and even if you take a donkey you will have to walk and climb for about 10 minutes near the end.      (updated Jun 2020)\n30.33973435.4259689 Desert View (beyond the Monastery). If you follow the track further from the Monastery, you will reach a camp offering tea and stuff to sell, which offers a great view of the desert to the west.\nPetra by Night. Happens on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday at 20:30 (be there at 20:15!). Entrance fee is 17 JD and you do not need a day pass. Order your tickets at your hotel, or buy them at the site's visitor center. The approach to the Treasury through the Site is lit only by candles. Musicians will play about 15 min of Bedouin music, and you'll be served some tea in paper cups while you sit on mats at the Treasury. It's best to see this before you see Petra by day, as it becomes far less impressive if you already walked up to the Treasury during daytime. It's not amazing, but it's something nice to do during nighttime. However, there are really mixed reviews of this. (updated Jun 2020)\nPrincess Alia Clinic, Brooke Hospital for Animals. Just inside the entrance to the park. As you can witness inside Petra, not all donkeys, horses and camels are treated right. A few are overworked, carrying overweight tourist or being excessively whipped. The Brooke charity educates owners about the treatment of equestrian working animals and treats the animals for free. The clinic is happy to tell you about conditions for working animals in Jordan. You can give a donation to the clinic.\n30.3235.478410 Wadi Musa. This is the city next to Petra, doesn't have any big touristic attraction except for a great panorama from uphill.\nPetra Museum (just past the security gate right next to the Petra ticket sales booths). A small museum with lots of great info and artifacts about Petra. free.\n\n## Do\nFor the terminally energetic, there are a number of popular hikes around Petra. Most hikes last about 1-3 hr round-trip.\nIn order to understand what Petra is, it is better to spend two days there. The first day: Siq - Treasury - City - Monastery. The second day: another way to Petra through Wadi Muthlim - see the Treasury from above on Jebel Al -Khubtha - High Place of Sacrifice. If you enter Petra through Wadi Muthlim do not turn left immediately after the small Siq, first go right to see Aqueduct, Tunnel and Al-Wu'eira Fort and only after that return to Petra center. It may not be possible to go through this route due to excess water in it. It's not recommended doing this route without a guide.\n30.329435.45031 Tomb Staircases. Just after the last tomb on the side of the Royal Tombs, there leads a staircase up the mountain which gives a good view of the Petra area. At the very end of this track there is a camp giving a great view from above the Treasury.\n30.32156135.4470482 High Place of Sacrifice. The site at the top of the mountain contains elaborate rock altars used for sacrifices. From the High Place, one can view much of Petra from above. Beautiful scenery. It can get cold and windy up there. The trek down the back side of the mountain reveals many interesting tombs and carvings that might be missed by the average tourist. The round trip generally takes 1.5-2.5 hr. Not many people go through the back route as it's not always clear where it starts - ask or use OpenStreetMap to identify the track. You might even try to use the direct track to the Treasury, which is even harder to find and not official, even though the staircases are clearly visible from down the Treasury.\n30.31709235.4066783 Mountain of Aaron (Jabal Haroun). This is the highest peak in the area. At the top you will find a small church and the tomb of Aaron, brother of Moses. The route to the top and back will take you past the Monastery and will take 4-8 hours depending on your chosen path.\n\n## Buy\nThroughout Petra, vendors will offer bottles of decorative sand art (small ones about 1 JD bigger ones up to 6 JD). While they may appear similar to other such souvenirs found in other Jordanian locations, these are unique in that the sand used to create the art is naturally colored sand scraped from the rock walls of various Petra canyons and not artificially colored. The most common design displays a camel's silhouette against a desert background. Some artists can write a name inside the sand bottle in a surprisingly short amount of time.\nBracelets, necklaces and rings are sold frequently by vendors walking around and presenting their goods. Offers vary extremely in price and often salespersons claim that they are made out of silver, even though they are not (1-5 JD is a fair price for most of the offered goods).\nThere is a fruit and vegetable market next to the minibus station in Wadi Musa.\nSouvenirs in Petra/Wadi Musa often cost twice or three times the price demanded in the rest of Jordan. So, if you are also going to visit the rest of Jordan, do your shopping there.\n\n## Ancient coin, mister?\nThe Bedouin tradesmen around the area will display artificial \"ancient\" Roman or Nabatean coins which are rather large in size. If pressed further, they will generally have a hidden stash of small, authentic coins from various periods. However buying these coins encourages the illegal looting of archaeological sites. To supply you with a souvenir the local inhabitants destroy graves, tombs and buildings in searches for coins and other antiquities. The Antiquities Law of 1988 states that individuals who engage in illicit excavations and/or trading in antiquities are criminals.\n\n## Petra\nThere is only one restaurant in all of the Petra site, at the far end of the Roman Highway. It's operated by Crowne Plaza, and it does a roaring trade despite steep pricing.  It also has the valley's monopoly on beer (6.5 JD for a 300 ml can, Oct 2018).\nFor just snacks and hot & cold drinks however, there are small stores and vendors scattered throughout Petra.  You can also bring your own food and drinks with you.  Some hotels will sell you a boxed lunch if you ask in advance.\nMany of these shops are powered by petrol. If you follow the electrical cables, they go up the slope into the old tombs where the generator is running. Not only does this create sound and air pollution, but the top of these old cave tombs becomes thick with soot and desecrating their beauty. Please don't buy from these vendors.\nShade is sparse in Petra, and on a hot summer day you can expect to go through at least 4 l of water (and more if you can afford to carry it). The need for water in the winter months is much less. You can buy water from shops in Petra, although the prices are high:  0.5-l bottles cost 1 JD, and 250 ml soft drinks cost 2 JD (Oct 2018).  On warm spring and summer days, if you can freeze a few bottles, then you'll be carrying around a cooling system, and have cold water to drink later in the day, too.\nThere are several bathrooms along the Main Trail with running water.\n\n## Wadi Musa\n30.32078535.4794031 Al-Janoub Sweets. Delicious sweets beyond the ordinary stuff sold by many shops around the country. Baklava filled with cheese or pudding, other sweety warm rolls and nuts and almonds specialities. 0.2 JD per small piece, 0.5 JD per piece on a plate.\nAl-Wadi Restaurant (on Shaheed roundabout/Circle in the center of town), ☏ +962 7 7725 9961. Reasonably priced, and the servers are extremely friendly. 2-4 JD for a main dish.\nCleopetra (below Circle/Al Wadhi restaurant). About 1 JD for a falafel or a tea.\nWrangler Bar (at Petra Palace Hotel). Cosy bar with alcoholic drinks and oldies but goodies music. 4 JD for beer and wine.\nValentine Inn (see below) sells various alcoholic beverages and is famous for that with the locals.\nSi Wan restaurant has some good local food with fair prices. Also, there's a good and cheap bakery near it.\nMountain Pub (at Hidab Hotel). Traditional wood bar with alcoholic beverages, hot and cold drinks, and snacks.\n\n## Sleep\nThe most authentic way to stay in Petra, and very budget and unique experience, is to stay in a cave with a local. When you walk around Petra you will be approached by many nice local people with camels or donkeys inviting you to have tea with them. When you talk to them for a bit, they will propose to stay in their cave with them, cook dinner for you and hang out with you in the evening. They can also help you get back to your hotel after dinner. It is a very basic accommodation, but they can give you blankets and mattresses. Of course they wouldn't do that if it were not for an appropriate donation, but something around the price of budget accommodations in town is reasonable. It is probably always best to stay in a group of friends, just in case. This way the \"payoff\" for the local is more worth the effort.\n\n## Budget\nMost accommodation will be available through the common hotel websites.

From 66 JD.\n\n## Stay healthy\nThe most cold and rainy months to visit Petra are December and January. In this time it is warm during the day and very cold in the evenings and at nights. That's why it is necessary to take coats, hats and gloves. And it could warm up your visit there if you take a thermos with hot tea with you. Avoid going if the forecast shows a lot of rain, as the guards may need to transport tourists out if the valley starts to flood.\nIn warmer months, the hot, dry air sometimes results in nosebleeds. If you're prone to that problem, then home remedies include smearing petroleum jelly to the insides of your nostrils.\nCarry plenty of water into Petra or bring 10–20 Jordanian dollars per person to buy water there.  In the hot summer months, you may want to add some oral rehydration products or to bring ice water.\nA good sunhat or baseball cap, sunglasses, and a generous hand with the sunscreen will help you avoid getting a heat stroke and sunburn.\n\n## Stay safe\nThe park is populated by a significant number of Bedouins, living in caves, tents, and buildings off the main tourist trail. A handful undertake herding and agriculture and your interactions with them (if any) are likely to be brief and pleasant; however, the vast majority are focused on tourism within the park. The perceived wealth of tourists, together with a high visitor turnover and ineffective authorities, can make the (unavoidable) interactions with these touts unsavory at best, and occasionally quite intimidating.\nSome practices have already be mentioned in the according chapters before. Here are some more:\nAnimal mistreatment – You will not visit Petra without witnessing the kind of animal abuse that would lead to imprisonment in western countries. The touts who work with horses, donkeys, and camels think nothing of beating them, including with sticks or rocks. This is especially prevalent towards closing time, and might entirely sour one's visit. Despite animal protection being mentioned on a sign near the entrance, the authorities have not yet fixed this issue.\nFake park rangers – In addition to the tourist police, some park rangers work in the park. The park rangers' primary tasks are to ensure the preservation and scenic quality of the site, and to assist tourists in education and appreciation of the park. Therefore, if a difficult gentleman claims to be a park ranger and insists on inspecting your ticket, consider showing him, but do not physically hand over your ticket.\nChanging money – One or two touts may ask you to exchange some foreign money (maybe a €10 note) to JD, complaining that there is no bank in Petra. It is not recommended.\nFemale travelers – The internet is awash with stories of female travelers who have experienced financial scams, uncomfortable situations, or worse. Western women are often assumed to be promiscuous and even a basic interaction might be construed as an advance. So accepting an invitation for a walk, an Arabic coffee, or an evening under the stars might be inadvisable. Likewise, in the adjoining town, if a woman sits in the front seat of a taxi (even in a group situation) this might be taken as an invitation.\nWhile going off the main tourist path is a rewarding experience for the trails, scenery, and less-visited archaeological sites—the further you stray, the less likely you are to come across police or fellow tourists who could help if necessary—best to always go in a group.\n\n## Cope\nWhile the main trail has proper bathrooms, you may not encounter one if you do some trekking. Be prepared with plenty of water and dig a cat hole. If you must use toilet paper (instead of a rock or water) or need to change a tampon or menstrual pad, be sure to dispose of it properly.  Many of the tombs in Petra are literally full of feces and (worse) feces-smeared toilet paper. Don't contribute to the desecration of these beautiful sites. If you have to go, bury your excrement off the trail (not in a tomb!) and dispose your toilet paper in a decent and proper manner.  Bring a small plastic bag with your toilet paper, so you can seal it up and carry it back to an appropriate trash can.\nIf you use a wheelchair or otherwise have mobility limitations, you will probably only be able to see part of Petra.  The valley floor is fairly smooth, but the higher parts of the city, including the Monastery, require climbing hundreds of steps.  A small number of electric golf carts (club cars) are available for short-term rental at the tourist center.  If you can get one, it will help travelers who with fatigue or who use a cane, but wheelchairs can't be carried on them.\n\n## Go next\n30.37434535.44979611 Little Petra — a scaled down version of Petra, is accessible by taxi or from Petra. It is less traveled than the main site and is well worth the visit if you spend more than a day in Wadi Musa. Approximate cost for a cab ride to and from the site, including having the taxi wait for an hour or so, is 25 JD (Oct 2018). There is also at least one minibus leaving from the bus station (city center) around 12:00. Price: Free.\nWadi Rum — a stunning desert valley in southern Jordan, lies about an hour south of Petra. Buses leave in the morning (~06:30) and generally cost 5 JD. Make arrangements through your hotel. Taxis for 40 JD (Oct 2018).\nDana Nature Reserve — stay in a local village within the Nature Reserve, and enjoy unforgettable hiking in an offshoot of the Great Rift.\n30.53144935.56083612 Shoubak Castle (Al-Shobak / Shawbak) (south of Kerek and Dana Reserve, from the highway (fuel station) it is a 20-min direct hike (not along the road)). It is on a hill with spectacular views and a great for a stop when going south to Petra. Most of the castle is a pile of rubble but there are underground rooms to explore, including the staircase (through a metal door that should be open) that goes down 375 steps to the old wells (tunnel and staircase temporarily closed for renovations. July 2023). Take a torch. At the bottom, you can climb up metal rungs to a hatch next to the road below the castle, then walk back up the road. Along a side road to the castle, you can also find 30.52925535.56505915 The smallest hotel in the world with a steep price of 25 JD, but maybe it can be bargained down to 15 JD, considering there is only space for one. Just nearby the owner of it also has regular rooms with dinner and breakfast. 1 JD.\nKerak — site of a once-mighty Crusader castle.\n31.46662435.57367713 Wadi Mujib — great nature reserve famous for its impressive canyons. Read more here. Limited access in winter.\nMadaba — known as the 'City of Mosaics' for its Byzantine and Umayyad mosaics, especially a large Byzantine-era mosaic map of Palestine and the Nile delta at St. George Church.\nDead Sea — The lowest point on earth and the most saline sea, letting you float on top.\nBuses to Aqaba also leave in the morning for 5 JD (price for tourists) (~07:00). From Aqaba, it is possible to cross the border to Eilat in Israel and from there to Taba in Egypt.\nTo get to Amman, you can take a minibus from the central bus station. There must be one every hour until 14:00 or 15:00. JETT also has a daily bus leaving at 17:00 from the parking close to the visitor center.\nFor a cheaper trip, a public minibus from Wadi Musa (Petra) to Ma'an is 0.55 JD and from there to Aqaba 1.5 JD. Also cheap buses to Amman from Aqaba pass by here.\nMost budget hotels have tours but the level of organization varies a lot and could prevent you from taking a tour. It is best to form a group yourself (at least 4 persons). An example tour could be Kings way trip: Shoubak Castle, Dana Nature Reserve, Tafilah, Karak Castle, Dead Sea, Mt. Nebo, Madaba & Churches, and Amman for about 30 JD at the Valentine Inn.",

          "content": "Little Petra (Arabic: البتراء الصغيرة, al-batrā aṣ-ṣaġïra), also known as Siq al-Barid (Arabic: سيق البريد, literally \"the cold canyon\"), is an archaeological site located north of Petra and the town of Wadi Musa in the Ma'an Governorate of Jordan. Like Petra, it is a Nabataean site, with buildings carved into the walls of the sandstone canyons. As its name suggests, it is much smaller, consisting of three wider open areas connected by a 450-metre (1,480 ft) canyon. It is part of the Petra Archeological Park, though accessed separately, and included in Petra's inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is often visited by tourists in conjunction with Petra itself, since it is free and usually less crowded.\nLike Petra, it was probably built during the height of Nabataean influence during the 1st century C.E. While the purpose of some of the buildings is not clear, archaeologists believe that the whole complex was a suburb of Petra, the Nabatean capital, meant to house visiting traders on the Silk Road. After the decline of the Nabataeans, it fell vacant, used only by Bedouin nomads, for centuries. Along with neighboring Beidha, Little Petra was excavated in the later 20th century by Diana Kirkbride and Brian Byrd.\nIn 2010, a biclinium, or dining room, in one of the caves was discovered to have surviving interior art depicting grapes, vines and putti in great detail with a varied palette, probably in homage to the Greek god Dionysus and the consumption of wine. The 2,000-year-old ceiling frescoes in the Hellenistic style have since been restored. While they are not only the only known example of interior Nabataean figurative painting in situ, they are a very rare large-scale example of Hellenistic painting, considered superior even to similar  later Roman paintings at Herculaneum.\n\nGeography\nLittle Petra is in an arid, mountainous desert region 1,040 metres (3,410 ft) above sea level. To the east the Arabian Desert opens up. On the west the rugged terrain soon descends into the Jordan Rift Valley, with lands around the Dead Sea as low as 400 metres (1,300 ft) below sea level.\nIt is on the local road that leaves Wadi Musa and follows the edge of the mountains around Petra itself through the small Bedouin village of Umm Sayhoun. About 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) north of Wadi Musa, a short road to the west leads to the narrow, unpaved parking lot for Little Petra and Beidha, a Neolithic site nearby. There is another small Bedouin settlement 1 km (0.6 mi) to the east.\n\nFrom the parking lot, Siq al-Barid opens up in the rock facade to the west southwest. Its name, literally \"cold canyon\", comes from its orientation and its high walls preventing the entry of most available sunlight. The modern name \"Little Petra\" comes from its similarities to the larger site to the south—both must be entered via a narrow canyon, and consist primarily of Nabataean buildings.\nThe canyon widens after 400 metres (1,300 ft). In this open area many of the sandstone walls have had openings carved into them; they were used as dwellings. On the south face is a colonnaded triclinium with a projecting pedimented portico that archaeologists believe was used as a temple, though they know very little about it.\nThe canyon then narrows again for another 50 m (150 ft), leading to another, smaller open area. The carved openings are even more numerous here, including four large triclinia. Archaeologists believe these spaces could have been used to entertain visiting merchants.\nOn the south side is a small biclinium. It has some rare surviving Nabataean paintings on its rear wall, and so it is called the Painted Room. Opposite the room on the north is a large cistern, part of the water system built by the original inhabitants.\nAt the west end of the canyon a set of steps leads to the top of the rock. There are panoramic views available of the entire Petra region. A lightly-used foot trail leads from there to Ad-Deir at Petra, 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) to the southwest.\n\nHistory\nArchaeologists believe that Little Petra was established in the 1st century CE, when the Nabataean culture was at its peak in the region. It was probably a suburb of the larger city to the south, perhaps where its more successful merchants lived, and entertained their visiting counterparts. The location may have been chosen because of the nearby older settlement of Beidha, inhabited since the earlier Neolithic era. Since investigations of the site have generally focused on the Nabataean and earlier periods, it is not known whether it was still inhabited around the same time Petra was abandoned, in the 7th century.\nFor the remainder of the millennium, and much of the next, Little Petra remained unknown to all but the Bedouin nomads who sometimes camped in it or its vicinity. Europeans, who could not visit the Arab world under Islamic rule, heard about Petra but were unsure of its existence. When Swiss traveler Jacob Burckhardt became the first nonlocal visitor to Petra since Roman times in 1812, he did not venture to its north, or did not write about it. Later global visitors to the region likewise seem to have concentrated on the main Petra site. Only in the late 1950s did British archaeologist Diana Kirkbride supplement her excavations at Petra itself with digs in the Beidha area, which included Little Petra, not described as a separate site at the time. Those digs continued until 1983, two years before UNESCO inscribed the Petra area, including Beidha and Little Petra, as a World Heritage Site.\nFollowing that designation, tourism to Petra increased, and spiked upwards again following the 1989 release of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which climaxed with the main characters riding down Petra's Siq to Al-Khazneh, where they found the Holy Grail. To assure that this growth benefited the region and did not degrade its archaeological resources, the Petra Regional Authority was created to manage all the resources within a 755-square-kilometre (292 sq mi) area. Beidha and Little Petra, among other satellite sites, were included in the 264-square-kilometre (102 sq mi) Petra Archaeological Park. The village of Umm Sayhoun was built between Wadi Musa and the two sites to house the Bedouin.\n\nPainted Biclinium\nLocated along the main avenue in Little Petra (Siq al-Barid), the Painted Biclinium is a rock-cut biclinium, or dining room, with well preserved wall paintings. In addition to offering the most abundant variety of figural painting from the Nabataean period, the frescoes of the Painted Biclinium may offer clues into the vegetation under cultivation in the area around Siq al-Barid. In addition, the paintings are proof of the importance of Dionysiac religious cult in Nabataea.\n\nLocation\nLittle Petra (Siq al-Barid) is a narrow wadi located some 8 kilometers north of the Petra city center. The wadi is a rich archaeological site, featuring rock cut tombs, stone-built architecture, and complex hydrological engineering. The site is located in the fertile northern hinterlands of Petra, a landscape that preserves evidence of large-scale viticulture and wine making, alongside the cultivation of grains, olives, and other produce. The Painted Biclinium is located on the south side of the Siq al-Barid. Surrounding the Painted Biclinium are a series of tombs and banqueting halls cut into the natural sandstone of the wadi, alongside the foundations of freestanding structures, cisterns, and water channels.\n\nDiscovery and fieldwork\nThe building and its frescoes were first photographed in the early 20th century by Père Abel (1906), and smoke damage and Arabic graffiti on the walls of the building demonstrate that the Painted Biclinium was continually occupied by local Bedouins. Studies of the frescoes relied almost exclusively on these early photographs, focusing on the visible iconography of the scenes and identifying the figures of Eros and Pan. When Nelson Glueck visited Little Petra, he did not see the frescoes at the Painted Biclinium for himself \"because of the hordes of fleas which infested it\". From 2006–2010, the Petra National Trust and the Courtauld Institute of Art in London carried out an extensive conservation project in the Painted Biclinium, which revealed new imagery on the monument and made clear the vibrancy of the color and style of the artwork. Most recently, samples of plaster and mortar were subjected to radiocarbon dating by Yarmouk University in Jordan, providing a calibrated date of 40 BCE–25 CE for the wall paintings.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Painted Biclinium comprises rock-cut stairs leading up from the floor of the Siq al-Barid, terminating at a platform hewn from the wall of the narrow wadi. The platform stands before the main entrance to the Biclinium, which leads to two chambers, one of which leads into the other. The first chamber is larger than the second, and is rectangular in shape with two benches carved out of the rock on either side of the door. The smaller, interior chamber is vaulted, and has a higher floor level than the first room. The monument parallels other feasting structures from both Little Petra and its environs, some of which are directly associated with nearby tombs and the veneration of ancestor cult, while other examples are not associated with tombs and are instead interpreted as spaces for religious feasting.\n\nFrescoes\nThe wall paintings in the Painted Biclinium can be grouped into two major scenes. The larger chamber has its south wall decorated with stucco, creating faux architectural elements reminiscent of some Pompeian wall painting.\n\nThe inner room has painted decoration in a completely different style than the larger outer room. Instead of architectural embellishment, the walls and vaulted ceiling of this room exhibit a complex program of intertwining vines, flowers, figures, several varieties of local birds, and insects. Several erotes—small winged gods associated with love and occasionally the cultivation of wine—are seen participating in viticulture management, using ladders and pruning hooks, carrying baskets of gathered grapes, and defending the vines from scavenging birds. The erotes are armed with bows, arrows, and spears. In addition to the domesticated and harvested grape vines, wild raspberry vines and field bindweed flowers wrap throughout the scene to pay homage to the local flora of Petra's northern hinterland. Twaissi et al. (2010) were able to identify an additional anthropomorphic figure in the scene in addition to the erotes, who they interpret as a representation of the Romanized Egyptian goddess. However, the overall iconographic scene and architectural parallels elsewhere in the area of Petra lend weight to the attribution of the space as a center of Dionysiac worship.\nIn addition to the figural and floral painting within the inner room of the Painted Biclinium, the room appears to have been further embellished with an intricate program of stuccoed decoration. Remnants of an entablature are preserved on the east and west walls of the room, and the center of the vault once held a stucco medallion.\n\nSignificance\nThe significance of these paintings lies in their figurative elements, a subject that is often absent in preserved Nabataean painting and other media. While a small fragment of a human face was found during the excavations of the Great Temple and the excavation of the Temple of the Winged Lions brought to light other select fragments, the frescoes at the Painted Biclinium form both the most complete painted scene in the Nabataean archaeological record and the only one remaining in situ. The features of the figural composition, including the almond eyes and round chins, have parallels with other pieces of Hellenistic painting and mosaic, while the floral and faunal subjects are distinctly local. In addition, while the archaeological record pointing to Dionysiac worship appears prolific among the Nabataean elite, few contexts preserve any record of this practice outside of architecture and pottery. The Painted Biclinium, then, serves to provide a colorful flourish to our understanding of this religious tradition in the cultivated rich semi-arid landscape around Petra.\n\nAccess\nLike Petra, Little Petra is open to the public during the daytime. It is, however, operated separately, and does not require an admission ticket and fee as Petra does. The local Bedouins sell souvenirs and snacks in the small parking lot, which also serves Beidha. Bedouin herders sometimes take their stock into the site to water at the cisterns.\nMany visitors to Petra have increasingly been including Little Petra on their itineraries. Guidebooks recommend it as less crowded and more relaxed than Petra itself. The Painted House, which has no counterpart at Petra, has also added to the attraction.\nIt is also possible to hike via the 6-kilometre (3.7 mi) trail from the end of the canyon to Ad-Deyr at Petra. Those who make the journey are advised to do so with a guide as the trail, while obvious in many places, is not formally marked. Hikers are also cautioned against attempting the trail alone, or late in the day, as nights in the region are often cold. It is also forbidden to enter Petra without having paid the larger site's admission.\n\nSee also\nList of World Heritage Sites in the Arab States\nMada'in Saleh, a Nabataean city in Saudi Arabia also inscribed as a World Heritage Site\nNegev incense route, ruins of four Nabataean cities in southern Israel, inscribed as a World Heritage Site\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Little Petra at Wikimedia Commons\nPhotos of Little Petra at the Manar al-Athar photo archive",
          "summary": "Little Petra (Arabic: البتراء الصغيرة, al-batrā aṣ-ṣaġïra), also known as Siq al-Barid (Arabic: سيق البريد, literally \"the cold canyon\"), is an archaeological site located north of Petra and the town of Wadi Musa in the Ma'an Governorate of Jordan. Like Petra, it is a Nabataean site, with buildings carved into the walls of the sandstone canyons. As its name suggests, it is much smaller, consisting of three wider open areas connected by a 450-metre (1,480 ft) canyon. It is part of the Petra Archeological Park, though accessed separately, and included in Petra's inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is often visited by tourists in conjunction with Petra itself, since it is free and usually less crowded.\nLike Petra, it was probably built during the height of Nabataean influence during the 1st century C.E. While the purpose of some of the buildings is not clear, archaeologists believe that the whole complex was a suburb of Petra, the Nabatean capital, meant to house visiting traders on the Silk Road. After the decline of the Nabataeans, it fell vacant, used only by Bedouin nomads, for centuries. Along with neighboring Beidha, Little Petra was excavated in the later 20th century by Diana Kirkbride and Brian Byrd.\nIn 2010, a biclinium, or dining room, in one of the caves was discovered to have surviving interior art depicting grapes, vines and putti in great detail with a varied palette, probably in homage to the Greek god Dionysus and the consumption of wine. The 2,000-year-old ceiling frescoes in the Hellenistic style have since been restored. While they are not only the only known example of interior Nabataean figurative painting in situ, they are a very rare large-scale example of Hellenistic painting, considered superior even to similar  later Roman paintings at Herculaneum.",

          "content": "Jerash or Jarash (Arabic: جرش, romanized: Ǧaraš, Arabic pronunciation: [dʒa.raʃ]; Greek: Γέρασα, romanized: Gérasa, Attic Greek pronunciation: [ɡérasa], Koine Greek pronunciation: [ˈɡerasa]) is a city in northern Jordan. The city is the administrative center of the Jerash Governorate, and has a population of 50,745 as of 2015. It is located 30.0 miles (48.3 kms) north of the capital city Amman.\nThe earliest evidence of settlement in Jerash is in a Neolithic site known as Tal Abu Sowan, where rare human remains dating to around 7500 BC were uncovered. Jerash flourished during the Greek, Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine periods, when it was known as Gerasa. It was one of the cities of the Hellenistic cities of the Decapolis. It was an important city in early Christian times and its early churches, some of which were formerly temples, include notable examples of the evolution of church architecture. In the mid-eighth century the 749 Galilee earthquake destroyed large parts of it, and subsequent earthquakes contributed to additional destruction.\nIn 1120, Zahir ad-Din Toghtekin, atabeg of Damascus ordered a garrison of forty men to build up a fort in an unknown site of the ruins of the ancient city, likely the highest spot of the city walls in the north-eastern hills. It was captured in 1121 by Baldwin II, King of Jerusalem, and utterly destroyed. The Crusaders immediately abandoned Jerash and withdrew to Sakib (Seecip); the eastern border of the settlement.\nJerash was then deserted and reappeared in the historical record at the beginning of Ottoman rule in the area during the early 16th century. In the census of 1596, it had a population of 12 Muslim households. However, archaeologists found a small Mamluk hamlet in the Northwest Quarter which indicates that Jerash was resettled before the Ottoman era. The excavations conducted since 2011 have shed light on the Middle Islamic period as recent discoveries have uncovered a large concentration of Middle Islamic/Mamluk structures and pottery. The ancient city has been gradually revealed through a series of excavations since 1925.\nJerash today is home to one of the best preserved Greco-Roman cities, which earned it the nickname \"Pompeii of the Middle East\". Approximately 330,000 visitors arrived in Jerash in 2018, making it one of the most visited sites in Jordan. The city hosts the Jerash Festival, one of the leading cultural events in the Middle East that attracts tens of thousands of visitors every year.\n\nHistory\nNeolithic age\nArchaeologists have found ruins of settlements dating back to the Neolithic Age. Moreover, in August 2015, an archaeological excavation team from the University of Jordan unearthed two human skulls that date back to the Neolithic period (7500–5500 BC) at a site in Jerash. This forms solid evidence of inhabitance of Jordan in that period, especially in connection with the existence of 'Ain Ghazal Neolithic settlement in Amman. The importance of the discovery lies in the rarity of the skulls, as archaeologists estimate that a maximum of 12 sites across the world contain similar human remains.\n\nBronze Age\nEvidence of settlements dating to the Bronze Age (3200–1200 BC) have been found in the region.\n\nHellenistic period\nJerash is the site of the ruins of the Greek city of Gerasa, also referred to as Antioch on the Golden River. Ancient Greek inscriptions from the city support that the city was founded by Alexander the Great and his general Perdiccas, who allegedly settled aged Macedonian soldiers there during the spring of 331 BC, when he left Egypt and crossed Syria en route to Mesopotamia. However, other sources, namely the city's former name of \"Antioch on the Chrysorrhoas,\" point to a founding by Seleucid King Antioch IV, while still others attribute the founding to Ptolemy II of Egypt.\nIn the early 80s BC Hasmonean King Alexander Jannaeus besieged and conquered Gerasa, incorporating it into the Kingdom of Judea. Archeological findings indicate that public buildings in Gerasa may have been destroyed during that period.\n\nRoman period\nWith the Roman conquest of the area in 63 BC, the short-lived Jewish rule of Gerasa came to an end. Pompey attached the city to the Decapolis, a league of Hellenistic cities that enjoyed considerable autonomy under Roman protection. The historian Josephus mentions the city as being principally inhabited by Syrians, and also having a small Jewish community. During the First Jewish–Roman War, Gerasa was among the few non-Jewish cities in the region not to kill or imprison its Jewish residents, and its residents even escorted any Jews who wanted to leave to the border. \nGerasa was the birthplace of the mathematician Nicomachus of Gerasa (Greek: Νικόμαχος) (c. 60 – c. 120 AD). It has been proposed to identify it as Geresh, a place mentioned by Josephus as the birthplace of Jewish Zealot leader Simon bar Giora, but other scholars identify it with modern-day Jurish.\nIn the second half of the 1st century AD, the city of Gerasa achieved great prosperity. In AD 106, Geras was absorbed into the Roman province of Arabia, which included the cities of Philadelphia (modern day Amman), Petra and Bostra. The Romans ensured security and peace in this area, which enabled its people to devote their efforts and time to economic development and encouraged civic building activity. Emperor Trajan constructed roads throughout the province, and more trade came to Jerash. Emperor Hadrian visited Gerasa in AD 129–130, and the triumphal arch known as the Arch of Hadrian was built to celebrate this occasion.\n\nByzantine period\nThe city finally reached a size of about 80 ha (200 acres) within its walls. Beneath the foundations of a Byzantine church built in Gerasa in AD 530  a mosaic floor was discovered with ancient Greek and Hebrew-Aramaic inscriptions. The presence of the Hebrew-Aramaic script has led scholars to suggest that the place was a synagogue converted into a church. Gerasa was invaded by the Persian Sassanids in AD 614. In 636, the Byzantine army was defeated in the Battle of the Yarmuk by the invading Muslim forces and these territories became part of the Rashidun Caliphate.\n\nUmayyad period\nThe city flourished during the Umayyad Caliphate. It had numerous shops and issued coins with the mint named \"Jerash\" in Arabic. It was also a centre for ceramic manufacture; molded ceramic lamps had Arabic inscriptions that showed the potter's name and Jerash as the place of manufacture. The large mosque and several churches that continued to be used as places of worship, indicated that during the Umayyad period Jerash had a sizable Muslim community that co-existed with the Christians. In 749, a devastating earthquake destroyed much of Jerash and its surroundings.\n\nCrusader period\nIn the early 12th century a fortress was built by a garrison stationed in the area by the Zahir ad-Din Toghtekin, atabeg of Damascus. Baldwin II, King of Jerusalem, captured and burned the fortress in 1121–1122. Although the site of the fortification has often been identified with the ruins of the temple of Artemis, there is no evidence of the construction of a fortification in the temple in the 12th century. The location of this fort is probably to be found at the highest point of the city walls, in the north-eastern hills.\n\nMid to Late Muslim period\nSmall settlements continued in Jerash during the Mamluk Sultanate, and Ottoman periods. This occurred particularly in the Northwest Quarter and around the Temple of Zeus, where several Islamic Mamluk domestic structures have now been excavated.\nIn 1596, during the Ottoman era, Jerash was noted in the  census as Jaras, being located  in the nahiya of Bani Ilwan in the liwa of  Ajloun. It had a population of 12 Muslim households.  They paid a fixed tax-rate of 25%  on various  agricultural products, including wheat, barley, olive trees/fruit trees, goats and beehives, in addition to  occasional revenues and a press for olive oil/grape syrup; a total of  6,000 akçe.\nIn 1838 Jerash was described as a ruin.\n\nClimate\nJerash has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa).\n\nArchaeology\nJerash is considered one of the largest and most well-preserved sites of Greek and Roman architecture in the world outside Italy.\n\nGreco-Roman period\nRemains in the Greco-Roman Gerasa include:\n\nOval forum 300 feet long surrounded by an Ionic colonnade\nTwo large sanctuaries dedicated to Artemis and Zeus with well preserved temples\nTwo theatres (the South Theatre and the North Theatre)\nThe long colonnaded street or cardo and its side streets or decumani\nTwo tetrapyla of Jerash, one at the intersection of northern-decumanus and cardo maximus and the other at the intersection of southern-Decumanus and cardo maximus\nArch of Hadrian\nThe circus / hippodrome\nTwo major thermae (communal baths complexes)\nA large nymphaeum fed by an aqueduct\nA macellum or porticoed market\nA trapezoidal plaza delimited by two open-exedra buildings\nAn almost complete circuit of city walls\nTwo large bridges across the nearby river\nAn extramural sanctuary with large pools and a small theatre.\nMost of these monuments were built by donations of the city's wealthy citizens. The south theatre has a focus in the center of the pit in front of the stage, marked by a distinct stone, and from which normal speaking can be heard easily throughout the auditorium. In 2018, at least 14 marble sculptures were discovered in the excavation of the Eastern Baths of Gerasa, including images of Aphrodite and Zeus.\n\nLate Roman and Early Byzantine period\nA large Christian community lived in Jerash. A large cathedral was built in the city in the 4th century, the first of at least 14 churches built between the 4th and the 7th-century, many with superb mosaic floors. The supposed sawmill of Gerasa is well described in the Visitors Centre. The use of water power to saw wood or stone is well known in the Roman world: the invention occurred in the 3rd century BC. They converted the rotary movement from the mill into a linear motion using a crankshaft; good examples are known also from Hierapolis and Ephesus.\n\nArchaeological museums\nThe archaeological site of Jerash has two museums in which are displayed archaeological materials and corresponding information about the site and its rich history. The Jerash Archaeological Museum, which is the older of the two museums, is found on top of the mound known as \"Camp Hill\" just east of the Cardo and overlooking the Oval Plaza. The small museum contains a chronological display of artifacts found in and around Jerash from prehistoric to Islamic times. The museum displays a unique group of small statues of a group identified as the Muses of the Olympic pantheon which were discovered at Jerash in 2016. The statues, which are Roman in date, were found in a fragmentary condition and have been partially restored. The museum also contains a well-preserved lead sarcophagus dated to the late 4th to 5th centuries and features Christian and pagan symbolism. The museum also has a number of sculptures, altars, and mosaics displayed outside. \n\nThe Jerash Visitor Center serves as a more recent archaeological museum, and presents the site of Jerash in a thematic approach with a focus on the evolution and development of the city of Jerash over time, as well as economy, technology, religion, and daily life. The center also displays further sculptures discovered in Jerash in 2016, including restored statues of Zeus and Aphrodite, as well as a marble head thought to represent the Roman Empress Julia Domna.\n\nModern Jerash\nJerash has developed dramatically in the last century with the growing importance of the tourism industry in the city. Jerash is now the second-most popular tourist attraction in Jordan, closely behind the ruins of Petra. On the western side of the city, which contained most of the representative buildings, the ruins have been carefully preserved and spared from encroachment, with the modern city sprawling to the east of the river which once divided ancient Jerash in two.\n\nDemographics\nJerash has an ethnically diverse population. The vast majority are Arabs, though the population includes small numbers of Kurds, Circassians and Armenians. \nJerash became a destination for many successive waves of foreign migrants. In 1885, the Ottoman authorities directed the Circassian immigrants who were mainly of peasant stock to settle in Jerash, and distributed arable land among them. The new immigrants have been welcomed by the local people. Later, Jerash also witnessed waves of Palestinian refugees who flowed to the region in 1948 and 1967. The Palestinian refugees settled in two camps; Souf camp near the town of Souf and Gaza (Jerash) camp at Al Ḩaddādah village.\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 3,796 inhabitants in Jerash, of whom 270 were Christians.\nAccording to the Jordan national census of 2004, the population of the city was 31,650 and was ranked as the 14th largest municipality in Jordan. According to the last national census in 2015, the population of the city was 50,745, while the population of the governorate was 237,059.\n\nCulture and entertainment\nSince 1981, the old city of Jerash has hosted the Jerash Festival of Culture and Arts, a three-week-long summer program of dance, music, and theatrical performances.\nPerformances of the Roman Army and Chariot Experience (RACE) at the hippodrome in Jerash feature forty-five legionaries in full armor in a display of Roman army drill and battle tactics, ten gladiators fighting \"to the death\" and several Roman chariots competing in a classical seven-lap race around the ancient hippodrome.\n\nEducation\nJerash has two universities: Jerash Private University and Philadelphia University.\n\nTourism\nThe number of tourists who visited the ancient city of Jerash reached 214,000 during 2005. The number of non-Jordanian tourists was 182,000 last year, and the sum of entry charges reached JD900,000. The Jerash Festival of Culture and Arts is an annual celebration of Arabic and international culture during the summer months. Jerash is located 48 km north of the capital city of Amman. The festival site is located within the ancient ruins of Jerash, some of which date to the Roman age (63 BC). The Jerash Festival is a festival which features poetry recitals, theatrical performances, concerts and other forms of art. In 2008, authorities launched the Jordan Festival, a nationwide theme-oriented event under which the Jerash Festival became a component. However, the government revived the Jerash Festival as the \"substitute (Jordan Festival) proved to be not up to the message intended from the festival.\"\n\nGallery\nSee also\nExorcism of the Gerasene demoniac\nJerash Cathedral\nScythopolis (Beth-Shean)\nTemple of Artemis, Jerash\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBrown, J., E.

          "content": "Jerash (arabe : جرش Ǧaraš ; grec : Γέρασα, latinisé en Gerasa) est le chef-lieu de la province de Jerash, dans le Nord du royaume de Jordanie. La population de l'agglomération dépasse 120 000 habitants.\nLa ville moderne s'est établie autour du site de l'antique cité de Gérasa, parfois francisée en Gérase.\nLe site archéologique est inscrit depuis 2004 sur la liste indicative du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco.\n\nHistoire\nGérasa a été fondée durant le  IVe siècle av. J.-C., sur une implantation ancienne. Selon ses habitants, la ville aurait été fondée par Alexandre le Grand en faveur de vétérans de son armée, sous la direction de Perdiccas. Cette prétention s'est exprimée tardivement sous la forme d'une monnaie frappée pendant le règne de Caracalla au nom « d'Alexandre de Macédoine, fondateur de Gérasa ». Néanmoins la cité n'a pris son essor qu'au IIe siècle av. J.-C., les fouilles n'ayant pas permis de trouver les traces d'un établissement antérieur.\nLa ville est développée sous l'impulsion d'Antiochos IV Épiphane qui régna de 175 à 164, et connue à l'époque helléninistique sous le nom d'Antioche de Chrysorrhoas.\nLa ville fit partie de la Décapole. Elle fut conquise en 84 av. J.-C. par Alexandre Jannée qui y est mort en 76 av. J.-C. pendant le siège d'une forteresse voisine, Régaba. Elle est prise par le Nabatéen Arétas III en 73 av. J.-C., et enfin par les Romains (Pompée) en 63 av. J.-C. Ces derniers en firent une ville opulente : Gérasa reçut même la visite de l'empereur Hadrien en 129.\nGérasa devient siège d'un évêché au IVe siècle. Elle est ensuite pillée par les Perses en 614, puis les Arabes en 635. Elle subit ensuite plusieurs tremblements de terre, dont le plus dévastateur fut probablement celui de 747-748, qui affecta violemment de nombreuses autres villes de la région. Le coup de grâce lui fut donné par les affrontements entre Musulmans et Croisés lors des Croisades, où le temple d'Artémis fut transformé en forteresse par les Arabes.\nLes premières fouilles furent effectuées dans les années 1920-1930 par les membres de l'équipe américano-britannique de l'université Yale, de l'American School of oriental research, et de la British School of Jerusalem ; après la publication du rapport Kraeling en 1938, sur toutes les fouilles faites sur le site jusque-là, celles-ci connaissent un moment de flottement avant d'être reprises véritablement dans les années 1980, notamment sous la forme d'un projet de coopération international, faisant appel à des archéologues du monde entier, le Jerash Archaeological Project. Chaque équipe se vit attribuer une portion du site à fouiller et à rénover. L'équipe française, dirigée par Jacques Seigne, s'occupe encore aujourd'hui de la rénovation du sanctuaire de Zeus.\nLa Jérash moderne a connu une extension très rapide et atteint désormais 135 000 habitants, selon le recensement de 2004. Cet accroissement rapide de la population est dû à l'immigration intérieure et à l'arrivée de nombreux réfugiés palestiniens.\n\nSite archéologique\nUn grand nombre de monuments ont été dégagés et, souvent, reconstitués.\n\nArc d'Hadrien\nL'arc de triomphe a été érigé à l'extérieur de la ville, au sud de l’hippodrome, en 129-130, pour la visite de l'empereur Hadrien à Gérasa. L'arc était à l'origine destiné à servir de nouvelle porte à la ville, Hadrien, selon une inscription, voulant fonder un nouveau quartier de la ville dans ce secteur. Cependant, ce projet de construction n'aurait pas été mené à bien, faute de moyens à cette époque.\nAprès des travaux de restauration, certains effectués avec les pierres d'origine entre 2003 et 2008, la porte à trois ouvertures a retrouvé sa hauteur d'origine de 21 m, pour une largeur totale de plus de 25 m.\n\nHippodrome\nL'hippodrome de Gerasa est probablement l'un des plus petits du monde romain. À l'époque byzantine, fortement touché par les tremblements de terre, il ne fut pas reconstruit, mais occupé par la population locale, notamment pour abriter des ateliers de poterie, visibles grâce aux fameux fours en brique ; un diacre y fit édifier son église en réaménageant trois locaux désaffectés de l'hippodrome, qu'il pava de mosaïques.\n\nThéâtre du sud\nLe théâtre du sud a été bâti entre 90 et 92 après J.-C. Il comportait 32 rangées de sièges pouvant accueillir jusqu'à 5 000 spectateurs. Le théâtre est construit à flanc de colline à l'ouest du temple de Zeus, et le niveau supérieur a une voûte en berceau. La scène est conçue dans un style romain classique, avec deux portes latérales voûtées et trois entrées faisant partie du décor. Les spectateurs n'étaient pas aveuglés par la lumière du soleil, car le théâtre faisait face au nord.\n\nTemple de Zeus\nLe sanctuaire de Zeus Olympien est un vaste ensemble monumental qui s'étage à flanc de colline. Depuis ses origines aux VIIe – VIe siècles jusqu’à son développement maximum au milieu du IIe siècle apr. J.-C., ce sanctuaire a vu se succéder de nombreuses constructions et des agrandissements.\nLes deux grands temples de Zeus et d'Artémis furent construits essentiellement au milieu du IIe siècle apr. J.-C., entretenant une rivalité entre les fidèles de chacune des deux divinités.\nUn autre temple, sous l'église Saint-Théodore, était probablement dédié à Dionysos. Un quatrième temple, réduit à ses fondations, a été nommé « temple C » par les membres de l'équipe américano-britannique des années 1930, aucun indice n'ayant été retrouvé pour dire à quel dieu il était voué.\n\nLe temple de Zeus a été établi sur une énorme voûte en berceau construite sur la pente qui domine le forum ovale. Un temple dédié à Zeus avait probablement existé sur le site à l'époque hellénistique : l'implantation du temple ne correspond pas au plan d'une ville romaine. Les ruines datent du IIe siècle après J.-C. et présentent des murs dont certaines parties s'élèvent encore à 10 m de haut. Le temple lui-même reposait sur une plate-forme de 41 m de long et 28 m de large. Suivant le style de construction syro-nabatéen, un escalier menait au toit de la cella. Le sanctuaire était entouré de 38 colonnes, dont trois d'origine sont encore en place aujourd'hui, tandis que d'autres colonnes ont été de nouveau érigées dans le cadre du programme de restauration de l'Administration jordanienne des antiquités.\n\nForum ovale\nLe forum ovale se trouve au pied du temple de Zeus. Ses dimensions sont de 90 × 80 mètres. L'ovale est bordé de colonnades. L'endroit a été choisi stratégiquement, couvrant une dépression naturelle. Pour compenser cela, le forum a été construit sur une sous-structure de 6 à 8 mètres de haut. Le contour en forme de poire n'est pas typique d'un forum romain et la vocation de la place du marché ovale reste controversée : c'était soit un lieu de commerce, soit un lieu de sacrifice.\nLe forum ovale de Gerasa est probablement le plus grand forum de l'Empire romain : faisant à la fois office de place publique, d'agora et de marché (de nombreuses boutiques ont été retrouvées à ses abords), c'est un élément essentiel de l'urbanisme de la ville qui permet, par un artifice architectural, de faire la jonction visuelle entre le cardo maximus et le sanctuaire de Zeus qui semble ainsi se trouver dans la continuité de la voie principale de la cité.\n\nCardo maximus, portes et tétrapyles\nLe cardo maximus est la voie principale de la ville. Bordée de colonnades, elle dessert les espaces publics et la plupart des monuments, entre les portes nord et sud : théâtres, temples, marchés. Deux tétrapyles marquent le croisement avec les deux grandes artères est-ouest (decumanus).\n\nLe Cardo Maximus de Jerash, en Jordanie, est une voie principale construite sous le règne de l'empereur Trajan au début du IIe siècle après J.-C. Elle faisait partie d'un vaste projet d'urbanisation visant à intégrer Jerash dans le réseau commercial et culturel de l'Empire romain. Cette rue pavée de 800 mètres, bordée de colonnes corinthiennes, servait de colonne vertébrale à la ville, facilitant le commerce, le transport et les échanges culturels.\nJerash, connue sous le nom de Gerasa à l'époque romaine, était un important centre commercial et culturel. La construction du Cardo Maximus marquait une étape clé dans l'intégration de la ville à l'Empire romain. En 614 après J.-C., l'invasion des Perses Sassanides a causé des dommages significatifs à Jerash, mais la ville a continué à jouer un rôle crucial dans la région jusqu'à son déclin au VIIIe siècle.\n\nL'architecture du Cardo Maximus illustre l'innovation romaine avec ses larges dalles de pierre calcaire pour un drainage efficace et ses trottoirs surélevés pour la sécurité des piétons. Les colonnades offraient un abri contre les intempéries, transformant la rue en une zone commerçante animée. Les pierres de taille massive utilisées pour la construction démontrent la maîtrise technique des tailleurs de pierre romains.\nAu fil des siècles, le Cardo Maximus a subi des transformations, notamment des restaurations sous les Byzantins et les Omeyyades, et des dommages causés par des tremblements de terre, notamment celui de 749 après J.-C. Aujourd'hui, le Cardo Maximus est bien conservé, mais fait face à des défis de conservation, notamment l'érosion naturelle et l'impact du tourisme. Des efforts de préservation sont en cours pour protéger cette rue historique contre les dégradations futures.\nLe Cardo Maximus est un témoignage impressionnant de l'urbanisme romain et de l'importance de Jerash dans l'Empire romain, représentant un axe commercial vital et un lieu de rassemblement social et culturel.\n\nMarché (macellum)\nLe macellum ou marché était un lieu central pour le commerce, fortement présent dans la cité, comme on peut le voir d'après les nombreuses boutiques qui bordent les rues.\nLe macellum, construit dans le premier quart du IIe siècle de notre ère, a d'abord été considéré comme l'agora de la ville, le pendant politique du forum ovale. On le considère désormais comme un marché alimentaire. Au centre se trouve un octogone, autour duquel l'argent aurait été changé. Des lions soutenaient un banc qui a pu servir d'étal pour exposer les marchandises. Le sol était recouvert de mosaïques.\n\nNymphée\nLe magnifique nymphée, large de 22 mètres, date également du IIe siècle. Le sanctuaire à deux étages dédié aux nymphes de l'eau est l'un des bâtiments les mieux conservés de l'ancienne Gerasa. L'étage inférieur du nymphée était recouvert de marbre. Celui du haut était orné de fresques, dont certaines sont encore visibles. La construction du toit est frappante : un demi-dôme avec un pignon brisé, qui s'arque au-dessus d'une grande fontaine magnifique. La façade de la fontaine était divisée en niches qui abritaient des statues. Certaines statues tenaient de grands récipients d'où l'eau se déversait dans le bassin de la Grande Fontaine. Un système complexe de canalisations amenait l'eau des environs.\n\nTemple d'Artémis\nLe temple d'Artémis, du IIe siècle de notre ère, était particulièrement imposant avec les dimensions de son mur d'enceinte de 160 × 120 m : il était certainement l'un des édifices les plus importants de la ville. Les pèlerins s'approchaient du temple par une voie processionnelle et un escalier menant de la ville. Onze des 32 piliers originaux du temple ont été conservés, dont neuf, mesurent 13 mètres de haut, ont encore leurs chapiteaux corinthiens. La cella elle-même mesurait 23 × 40 m.\n\nCathédrale et autres églises paléochrétiennes\nAu IVe siècle, la communauté chrétienne était nombreuse et on a retrouvé les traces de treize églises aux sols recouverts de mosaïques, dont une cathédrale, la cathédrale Saint-Théodore. On a trouvé aussi les restes d'une synagogue de la même époque, située au nord-ouest du sanctuaire d'Artémis.\n\nOn a retrouvé un grand nombre d'églises de l'Antiquité tardive, notamment de l'époque de l'empereur Justinien (527 à 565), avec des sols en mosaïque en partie bien conservés :\n\nla « cathédrale », une basilique à colonnes à trois nefs de la fin du IVe siècle ;\nl'église de Théodose, basilique à hautes colonnes corinthiennes, 494-496 ;\nl'église de Prokopios, vers 526 ;\nl'église Saint-Georges, à partir de 529 ;\nl'église-synagogue, synagogue transformée en église vers 530/531 ;\nl'église Saint-Jean, de 531, un bâtiment rond d'environ 24 × 30 mètres ;\nl'église Saints-Côme-et-Damien, vers 533, avec un beau sol en mosaïque ;\nl'église Pierre-et-Paul : basilique à colonnes, vers 540, à côté l'église du Souvenir (église-halle) ;\nl'église des Propylées, vers 560 ;\nl'église de l'évêque Genesius, de 611.\n\nThéâtre du nord\nLe théâtre du nord est situé à côté du sanctuaire d'Artémis. Tout comme celui du sud, le théâtre du nord a été remarquablement restauré. Tous deux accueillent des spectacles locaux, généralement en période estivale.\n\nHabitations\nLes vestiges d'habitations sont relativement sommaires, et il s'agit en majorité de réoccupation de bâtiments publics de l'époque romaine : deux maisons ont été découvertes du côté oriental du wadi, recouvertes de mosaïques, dont l'une décrit un cortège bachique, et une seconde, les quatre saisons, thème que l'on rencontre assez fréquemment dans la région (voir notamment à Madaba) ; du côté ouest de la ville, la « maison des Bleus » est ainsi nommée d'après une inscription, ainsi qu'une splendide demeure d'époque byzantino-omeyyade, dont les vestiges apparents datent essentiellement de la période arabe ; enfin, un quartier d'habitation situé au nord-ouest de la cathédrale Saint-Théodore a été dégagé et fouillé rapidement dans les années 1930, comptant des structures domestiques individuelles, probablement destinées à loger les membres du clergé de la cathédrale. Cet ensemble se trouve aujourd'hui à nouveau enfoui sous le remblai résultant du dégagement du sanctuaire d'Artémis. À proximité se trouve la « Clergy House », encore visible, considérée par Kraeling comme un logement pour le clergé, mais dont la destination reste encore aujourd'hui douteuse, faute de fouilles approfondies.\n\nThermes\nDeux établissements de bains, qui s'étendaient au niveau du tétrapyle nord, sont en grande partie effondrés.\nLes « bains de Placcus », peu fouillés, mais apparemment de taille remarquable, étaient situés de l'autre côté du wadi de Jérash, c'est-à-dire du côté ouest de la ville, à côté de la cathédrale Saint-Théodore, juste au-dessous de la « Clergy House ». On distingue encore les vestiges des fours de l'hypocauste servant à chauffer le caldarium ; une inscription de l'extrême fin du Ve siècle en attribue la construction à l'évêque Placcus.\n\nMur d'enceinte\nUne muraille entoure encore presque toute la ville : après avoir laissé à l'abandon ses premiers murs créés avant notre ère, la cité s'entoura d'un nouveau rempart qui réduisit ses dimensions, la ramenant à la porte sud et laissant à l'extérieur toute la zone allant de la porte sud à l'arc d'Hadrien, et comprenant l'hippodrome.\n\nMusées archéologiques\nLe site archéologique de Jerash possède deux musées archéologiques.\n\nLe Musée archéologique de Jerash (en), qui est le plus ancien des deux, se trouve sur un monticule, à l’entrée sud du site, juste à l'est du cardo et surplombant le forum ovale. Le petit musée contient une présentation chronologique des artefacts trouvés dans et autour de Jerash, de la Préhistoire à l'époque islamique. Le musée présente un groupe unique de petites statues d'un groupe identifié comme les Muses du panthéon olympien, découvertes à Jerash en 2016. Les statues, d'époque romaine, retrouvées dans un état fragmentaire, ont été partiellement restaurées. Le musée conserve un sarcophage de plomb bien conservé datant de la fin du IVe siècle, présentant des symboles chrétiens et païens. Le musée possède aussi un certain nombre de sculptures, autels et mosaïques exposés à l'extérieur.\nLe centre d'accueil des visiteurs de Jerash comprend un second musée archéologique plus récent, qui présente le site de Jerash dans une approche thématique, mettant l'accent sur l'évolution et le développement de la ville au fil du temps, ainsi que sur l'économie, la technologie, la religion et la vie quotidienne. Le centre présente d'autres sculptures découvertes en 2016, notamment des statues restaurées de Zeus et d'Aphrodite, ainsi qu'une tête féminine en marbre supposée représenter l'impératrice romaine Julia Domna.\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nAndré Gagné, « De l’intentio operis à l’intentio lectoris : Essai herméneutique à partir de l’épisode du démoniaque de Gérasa (Mc 5,1-20) », Théologiques, vol. 12, nos 1–2,‎ 2004, p. 213–232 (lire en ligne)\nMaurice Sartre, D'Alexandre à Zénobie.

          "content": "## Overview\nJerash, a city in northern Jordan, is famous for its Roman ruins. The archaeological site is popular for tourists, second only to Petra.\n\n## Understand\n48 km (30 miles) north of the capital Amman, Jerash is known for the ruins of the Greco-Roman city of Gerasa, also referred to as Antioch on the Golden River. It is sometimes misleadingly referred to as the \"Pompeii of the Middle East\", referring to its size, extent of excavation and level of preservation (though Jerash was never buried by a volcano).\nJerash became an urban center during the 3rd century BC and a member of the federation of Greek cities known as the Decapolis (\"ten cities\" in Greek). Jerash prospered during the 1st century BC as a result of its position on the incense and spice trade route from the Arabian Peninsula to Syria and the Mediterranean region. Jerash was a favorite city of the Roman emperor, Hadrian, and reached its zenith in AD 130, flourishing economically and socially. The city began to decline in the 3rd century, later becoming a Christian city under the rule of the Byzantine empire. The Muslims took over in AD 635, but the final blow to the city was dealt by Baldwin II of Jerusalem in AD 1112 during the Crusades.\nModern Jerash sprawls to the east of the ruins, sharing the same city wall but little else. Thankfully, the ruins have been carefully preserved and spared from encroachment.\n\n## By car\nFrom 8th Circle in Amman, take the north-west road out towards Salt. Eventually you must turn northward, but brown tourism signs clearly mark the road towards Jerash.\n\n## By bus\nGetting to Jerash is very easy and cost effective on your own and you don't need a tour. You can go to Jerash and back for 2 JD from the Tabarbour Bus Station (North station) in Amman, or from Sweileh park. At the Tabarbour Bus Station, buses leave for Jerash – 1.00 JD, about one hour, but are not that frequent (May 2025) since the BRT is running. It is better to take them close to the Sweileh park (1.00 JD). From downtown Amman, take the BRT (Bus Rapid Transfer) at the Jordan Museum and go directly to its terminus at Sweileh BRT Station. From there, leave the station, cross the park and ask people for the serviis to Jerash.\nIn Jerash, the minibuses to Amman leave from a junction by the handicraft building (10-minute walk south from the visitor's centre). When coming back to downtown from Tabarbour station tell the taxi driver you are going to Raghadan Al Seyaha. There is another Raghadan station in Amman that is a few kilometers from downtown so the last stop may be that one!\n\n## By taxi\nA private taxi from Amman can be hired for 8-10 JD one-way. Expect to pay as much as 40 JD for a return trip and taxi driver staying on site while you look around. As always, negotiate the amount beforehand and specify that the price is for the whole taxi and not \"per person,\" which most taxi drivers will try to charge you.\n\n## Get around\nWalking is the only choice you have – about 3 km all together. Get in at the south end of the archaeological site south of the Hippodrome. The North Gate is closed.\n\n## See\nSigns describing the history of each set of ruins have been introduced, and you can pick up a map to orient yourself at the Visitor Centre, at the South Gate of the archaeological park. You can exit at the North Gate, which is across from the bus station.\nThe ruins are extensive compared to many other sites, but it's not hard to see everything in a couple of hours. It is unlikely that visitors will miss anything important.\nBeware of the many touts inside the area, who will try to sell you \"original\" coins, artifacts and antiques, after they helped you taking your picture. If they stand in the way of your picture in front of the many sights, especially the Nymphaeum and the Temple of Artemis, firmly ask them to step aside. If they do not cooperate, tell them you will complain with the visitor center.\nIf you go first thing in the morning, you can avoid most of the tour groups arriving from Amman.\nJerash Ruins.

Please refrain from buying from them, as this practice is not legal.\n\n## Eat\nAlong the road into Jerash there are several other restaurants from which to choose.\n32.26728935.8887111 The Lebanese House (Walk past the police kiosk on the main street and turn down the dirt road), ☏ +962 26351301.

A bit outside the main town, recommended to visit in the week, the weekends are pretty busy. 3 JD.\n\n## Go next\nThe 32.28540935.8952791 Jerash Bus Station is outside the northern end of the Jerash archaeological side. However, buses also leave from the 32.27022735.8909342 main junction in Jerash just south of the Hippodrome to Amman and Ajlun Castle.\nAjlun & Ajlun Castle – The castle is an interesting maze of passages and levels, and offers a wonderful view of the surrounding area, northwestern Jordan, and off into Galilee. This Islamic fortress is a mere 16 km east from Jerash. The castle is located on the top of a mountain just outside the small city of Ajlun. If you start your day early enough, you can take the bus from Amman to Ajlun and see the castle. Afterwards take a bus from 'Ajloun to Jerash, while still having plenty of time to spend at Jerash. Ajlun and Jerash make a good combination day; however, most buses travel from Ajlun to Jerash and not the other direction. Therefore, it is better to travel from Amman to Aljun Castle, then to Jerash, then back to Amman. Once in Aljun, take a taxi to Aljun Castle and arrange for the taxi to wait for you or to transport you back to the Aljun bus station. In the afternoon the buses become infrequent and you run the risk of being left in one of the cities if you do not plan accordingly, especially during Ramadan. If this occurs, stand around across from the police station and you can probably bargain with a private driver to take you back to Amman.\nIrbid – The main industrial and administrative centre in the north of the kingdom, and a staging point for exploration further afield to Gadara (Umm Qais), Pella and other nearby sites within the region. 40 km north of Jerash.",

          "title": "Umm Qais",
          "content": "Umm Qais (Arabic: أم قيس, lit. 'Mother of Qais'), also known as Qays, is a town in northern Jordan principally known for its proximity to the ruins of the ancient Gadara. It is the largest city in the Bani Kinanah Department and Irbid Governorate in the extreme northwest of the country, near Jordan's borders with Israel and Syria.  Today, the site is divided into three main areas: the archaeological site (Gadara), the traditional village (Umm Qais), and the modern town of Umm Qais.\n\nLocation\nUmm Qais is located 28 km north of Irbid and 120 km north of Amman. It expanded from the ruins of ancient Gadara, which are located on a ridge 378 metres (1,240 ft) above sea level, overlooking the Sea of Tiberias, the Golan Heights, and the Yarmouk River gorge. Strategically central and located close to multiple water sources, Umm Qais has historically attracted a high level of interest.\n\nHistory\nAntiquity\nGadara was a centre of Greek culture in the region during the Hellenistic and Roman periods.\nThe oldest archaeological evidence at Umm Qais, extends back to the second half of the third century BC. and the site appears to have been founded as a military colony by Alexander the Great's Macedonian Greeks. However, the site's name \"Gadara\" is not Greek in origin, but rather a Greek version of a local Semitic name meaning \"fortifications\" or \"the fortified city\" suggesting the military colony was founded on a pre-existing fortified site.\nLocated on the boundary between Seleucid and Ptolemaic territory, the city was strategically important and was repeatedly the focus of military conquests throughout the succession of Syrian Wars between 274–188 BCE. The city's military importance during this period was noted by the Greek historian Polybius' describing it in 218 BCE as a fortress and \"the strongest of all places in the region\".\nThe Roman-Seleucid War (192–188 BCE) weakened Seleucid control over the region devolving autonomy in Palestine and trans-Jordan to the Hasmonean, Iturean and Nabatean kingdoms whose rivalries continued to make Gadara a strategically important city and the focus of continued conflict.\nIn 98 BCE the Hasmonean King Alexander Jannaeus subjected the city to a 10 month siege, wresting control of the city and the trade routes to the ports of the Eastern Mediterranean that passed through it from the Nabateans. The Nabatean response culminated in Nabatean King Obdas 1st' decisive victory over Jannaeus at the Battle of Gadara in 93 BCE.\nIn 63 BCE, Roman general Pompey conquered the region, Gadara was rebuilt and became a member of the semi-autonomous Roman Decapolis. 33 years later Augustus attached it to the Jewish kingdom of his ally, Herod. After King Herod's death in 4 BCE, Gadara became part of the Roman province of Syria.\nTo supply larger populations Gadara, and the neighbouring Decapolis cities of Adraa (Dera'a, Syria) and Abila (Qweilbeh, Jordan) undertook construction of a water supply system of 170 km of aqueduct tunnels connecting the cities to springs throughout southern Syria and an artificially constructed lake at Dille. Constructed between 90–210 CE the network of rock cut tunnels included 2,900 access shafts, and a single 106 km section represents one of the most significant hydro-engineering accomplishments of the ancient world.\nDuring the Severan period (193–235 CE) the city underwent a rapid expansion westwards and many of the large civic monuments still visible on the site today date to this period and attest to an increase in importance and prosperity. After the Christianisation of the Eastern Roman Empire, Gadara retained its important regional status and became for many years the seat of a Christian bishop.\n\nEarly Islamic period\nThe Battle of Yarmouk in 636 CE a short distance from Gadara, brought the entire region under Arab-Muslim rule.\nOn 18 January 749 CE much of the city was destroyed by the Galilee earthquake. Whilst the city was extensively damaged, archaeological evidence of limited reconstruction, including conversion of the large five aisle basilica church into a mosque indicates the continued settlement of the site at least into the 11th Century.\nBy the 13th Century the site is noted in historic sources under the new name of \"Mukais\" a local term meaning border place or customs house and from which the modern name of Umm Qais gradual derived.\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1596 it appeared in the Ottoman tax registers named as Mkeis, situated in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Bani Kinana, part of the Hauran Sanjak. It had 21 households and 15 bachelors; all Muslim, in addition to 3 Christian households. The villagers paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on agricultural products; including wheat, barley, summer crops, fruit trees, goats and bee-hives. The total tax was 8,500 akçe.\nIn 1806 Ulrich Jasper Seetzen visited Umm Qais and identified it as the location of ancient Gadara, describing the Ottoman settlement and the tombs and other monuments still visible on the surface. The ancient ruins at Um Keis were recorded again by western visitors in 1816 and 1838. By 1899 Schumacher, visiting the site as part of his survey work for the Hijaz railway records the village had expanded significantly with the construction of larger houses, noting also that many of the tombs recorded by early visitors were no longer present. Umm Qais's most impressive building, the Ottoman governor's residence known as Beit Rousan, \"Rousan House\", dates to this period of expansion in the Late Ottoman period.\n\nModern period\nIn 1920 the Madafa and Hosh (courtyard) of Hajj Mahmoud al Rousan's house in Umm Qais hosted a conference of Arab leaders from across the middle east to draw up a treaty in response to the British and French plan to divide the region following the end of the British and French Mandates.\nThe village's school was opened in 1922 by HRH King Abdullah I of Jordan making it the third oldest school in Jordan after those in Salt and Kerak.\nBy 1961 the population of Umm Qais was 1,196 inhabitants.\nDuring the 1967 Arab-Israeli war Umm Qais' strategic location put it on the front line of conflict again. Heavy shelling from the Golan Heights and aircraft bombing damaged both the village and the ancient city. The underground Roman mausoleum below the five-aisled basilica in the west of the ancient was discovered by accident by the Jordanian army and the large intact underground chamber was used as a temporary field hospital during the conflict.\n\nPreservation efforts\nIn 1974 the German Protestant Institute of Archaeology uncovered the ruins of a Byzantine church building in Umm Qais.\nSince 2005, the Orient Department of the German Archaeological Institute under the direction of Claudia Bührig has been active at Gadara. The team has uncovered Egyptian and Greek imported pottery, stamped amphorae, and a Seleucid fortress, among other things.\nIn 2015, the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation and Yarmouk University collaborated to better preserve the Roman Aqueduct of Gadara in Umm Qais. This project was completed in 2018, strengthening the largest remaining subterranean Roman aqueduct.\n\nTourism\nMany visitors come to Umm Qais on day trips from the capital, Amman, roughly 110 kilometres (68 mi) to the north, to see its extensive ruins and enjoy its panoramic views. The Sea of Galilee and Tiberias, Israel, are visible, and just across the valley of the Yarmouk River is the southern end of the Golan Heights, Syria, under Israeli occupation since the Six-Day War in 1967. Mount Hermon bordering Lebanon is visible in the distance on clear days.\nAt Beit Rousan, now housing a visitor Centre and a museum, Greek statues and Christian mosaics discovered during archaeological excavations of ancient Gadara are exhibited.\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nGCatholic - (titular) bishopric\nIrbid Guide (in Arabic)\nGreater Irbid Municipality (in Arabic)\nIrbid news (in Arabic)\nHistory and pictures\nGreco-Roman & Decapolis city of Gadara \nPhotos of Umm Qais at the American Center of Research",

          "content": "Umm Qeis est une ville de Jordanie, dans la province jordanienne d'Irbid à 20 km au nord-ouest de la capitale provinciale Irbid et à 3 km au sud du Yarmouk.\nElle est construite à l'emplacement de l'antique ville de Gadara. La ville s'est aussi appelée Antioche ou Antiochia Sémiramis et Séleucie, et faisait partie des cités de la Décapole.\n\nHistoire\nLe nom de Gadara est vraisemblablement sémitique. Il est probablement dérivé de l'hébreu gader qui signifie confins ou frontière.\nLa ville est prise par Antiochos III lors de sa première invasion de la Palestine en 218 av. J.-C.. La ville est renommée Antiochia Semiramis (ou Antioche) et Séleucie. En 102 av. J.-C., Alexandre Jannée l'investit et la prend après un siège de dix mois. Pompée l'aurait restaurée vers 63 av. J.-C., pour plaire à Démétrius son affranchi, originaire de la ville, qu'il avait acheté sur le marché aux esclaves de Rome. Démétrius s'était exilé à la suite des guerres menées par Alexandre Jannée et sa politique de judaïsation. Démétrius, devenu plus riche que son ancien maître, aurait fait construire à Rome le théâtre attribué à Pompée et aurait consacré une partie de sa fortune à la reconstruction de sa ville natale.\nEn 57 av. J.-C., Gabinius est nommé proconsul en Syrie. Il sort vainqueur d'un affrontement avec le roi des juifs Aristobule qu'il remplace par Hyrcan II dont la fonction se réduit à diriger le temple de Jérusalem. Il dote cinq cités de sénat de notables. Les villes ainsi gouvernées sont Jérusalem, Gadara, Amathonte, Jéricho et Sepphoris. Les Juifs, plus soumis à un monarque, accueillent favorablement ce mode de gouvernement.\nIl semble que la ville décline ensuite sous la domination des Juifs. C'est de cette date que l'ère de la ville débute. Elle est donnée par Auguste à Hérode le Grand en 30 av. J.-C.. L'empereur ne prêta pas attention aux habitants accusant Hérode de cruauté.\nÀ la mort d'Hérode, la ville est réunie à la province de Syrie en 4 av. J.-C.. Au début de la révolte des Juifs, la région est dévastée. Une partie de la cité se rend à Vespasien, qui y place une garnison. Elle reste une ville importante, et devient le siège d'un évêché.\n\nElle tombe aux mains des Arabes dès 636, après la défaite des Byzantins à la bataille du Yarmouk (20 août 636), puis est en grande partie détruite par un séisme en 747, et abandonnée.\n\nDescription\nGadara est l'une des dix villes semi-autonomes de la Décapole.\nUmm Qeis correspond à la description que les auteurs anciens font de Gadara. C'est une puissante forteresse, proche du Hiéromax (actuelle rivière Yarmouk), à l'est de Tibériade et de Scythopolis, au sommet d'une colline, à trois miles romains au sud de sources d'eau chaude et de bains à Amatha. La ville se trouve sur une arête étroite qui s'amenuise des montagnes de Gilead vers le Jourdain.\nL'arête descend en pente douce à l'est, qui forme le seul accès : des trois autres côtés, la ville est séparée de la vallée par un escarpement. Les murs ont une longueur de plus de trois kilomètres. Une importante voie romaine conduit vers l'est à Darʿā.\nDans la ville se trouvent les ruines de deux théâtres, d'une basilique, d'un temple et de nombreux autres bâtiments importants, ce qui démontre l'existence d'une grande ville. Une rue pavée bordée d'une double colonnade, traverse la ville d'est en ouest. Un aqueduc apportait l'eau depuis le mont Hermon et passait à Abila, c'était un des plus longs de l'Empire romain.\nLe site est inscrit sur la liste indicative au patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco depuis 2001.\nUmm Qeis obtient en 2022 le label Meilleurs villages touristiques de l'Organisation mondiale du tourisme.\n\nPersonnalités liées à la ville\nPhilon de Gadara, mathématicien, maître d'Archimède.\nLe philosophe épicurien Philodème de Gadara (né vers 110 av. J.-C. et mort vers 40 av. J.-C)\nLe philosophe cynique Ménippe de Gadara (milieu du IIIe siècle av. J.-C.)\nLe poète Méléagre de Gadara (fin du IIe siècle av. J.-C.)\nThéodore, maître de rhétorique de l'empereur Tibère (Ier siècle)\n\nLe miracle raconté dans les évangiles synoptiques\nLe miracle des pourceaux est raconté dans les trois évangiles synoptiques. Dans les trois récits il s’agit d’un ou deux hommes possédés par des démons. Jésus le(s) délivre et les démons demandent à se réfugier dans le corps de pourceaux qui vont ensuite se jeter dans le lac de Tibériade. Ces trois récits comportent quelques divergences.\n\nDans l’évangile selon Matthieu, Jésus arrive au « pays des Gadaréniens » faisant clairement référence à Gadara. Cet évangile parle de deux possédés et d’un troupeau de pourceaux. C’est le récit le plus concis des trois.\nL’évangile selon Marc ne cite qu’un seul individu portant des fers aux pieds qu’il a rompus. Celui-ci est possédé par un démon qui dit s’appeler Légion et qui entre dans les pourceaux au nombre de deux mille. La région est appelée le « pays des Geraséniens » qui se réfère à Gérasa (Jerash) plutôt qu’à Gadara. Dans la traduction de Louis Segond, on trouve « Gadaréniens » comme dans l’évangile selon Matthieu. Après sa guérison, le possédé « s'en alla et se mit à publier dans la Décapole quelles grandes choses Jésus lui avait faites. »\nDans sa traduction de l’évangile selon Luc, Louis Segond écrit cette fois « pays des Géraséniens » bien que le texte grec contienne « pays des Gergéséniens. C’est une référence à la ville de Gergésa (Kursi) » au bord du lac de Tibériade souvent citée comme lieu de ce miracle. Le possédé est nu au moment de la rencontre avec Jésus, puis après sa guérison il est revêtu.\nLes trois récits situent le miracle sur la rive est du lac de Tibériade, en pays où vivent des païens puisqu’on y élève des porcs ce qui serait impensable en pays juif. Gergésa est sur la rive du lac, le troupeau de porcs est dans la montagne aux environs dans les évangiles selon Marc et selon Luc. Les porcs se « précipitent sur les pentes escarpées » jusque dans la mer (le lac) dans les trois récits. Enfin la distance de Gadara au lac de Tibériade est de 9 km alors que les pentes des collines voisines de Gergésa ne sont qu’à un km, ce qui peut accréditer l’opinion que Gergésa est le lieu de ce miracle et non Gadara. Autres traits communs aux trois récits, aucune allusion n’est faite au propriétaire de ce troupeau et les habitants de la ville demandent à Jésus de quitter leur territoire.\nMartin Dibelius classe ce récit comme histoire qu’il distingue d’autres récits comme celui de la passion et qu’il désigne comme légende qu’il faut entendre dans le sens de « récit de la vie d’un saint » qui doit être lue. De son point de vue, la réalité de ce miracle et sa localisation importent finalement peu. En revanche, la leçon qu’il illustre est importante, il ne s’agit que d'illustrer la toute-puissance de Jésus sur les esprits du mal.\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nArticles connexes\nDécapole\n\nBibliographie\nMaurice Sartre, D'Alexandre à Zénobie.

          "content": "Umm el-Jimal (Arabic: ام الجمال, \"Mother of Camels\"), also rendered as Umm ej Jemāl, Umm al-Jimal or Umm idj-Djimal, is a village in northern Jordan approximately 17 kilometers east of Mafraq. It is primarily notable for the substantial ruins of a Byzantine and early Islamic town which are clearly visible above the ground, as well as an older Roman village (locally referred to as al-Herri) located to the southwest of the Byzantine ruins.\n\nOverview\nUmm el-Jimal is a large village located in northern Jordan less than 10 km (6.2 mi) from the Syrian border. It is located in the Hauran, the northern desert region of the country. Despite this aridity, Umm el-Jimal is surprisingly well suited for agriculture, and its livelihood and economy is largely derived from agricultural and pastoral sustenance. The ruins of an ancient village lie in the midst of modern Umm el-Jimal. The ruins date from the Nabataean through the Abbasid periods. The earthquake circa 749 did major damage, but the community survived well into the Abbasid period. In the early 20th century the area was repopulated by the Druze and then the Bedouin Msa'eid tribe.\n\nHistory\nThe village of Umm el-Jimal originated in the 1st century CE as a rural suburb of the ancient Nabataean capital of Bostra. A number of Greek and Nabataean inscriptions found on the site date the village to this time. During the first century, the population of the site is estimated at 2,000–3,000 people. Upon the foundation of Provincia Arabia in 106, the Romans took over the village as Emperor Trajan incorporated the surrounding lands into the empire. In the village, the Romans erected a number of buildings including the Praetorium and the large reservoir near the castellum. After the Rebellion of Queen Zenobia in 275, Roman countermeasures included the construction of a fort (Tetrarchic castellum) that housed a military garrison. As Roman influence in the area gradually diminished, the area once again became a rural village. During the 5th and 6th centuries, Umm el-Jimal prospered as a farming and trading town in which the population jumped to an estimated 4,000–6,000 people. However, after the Muslim conquests of the 7th century, the village population diminished even though building projects and renovations continued to take place. In circa 749, an earthquake destroyed much of the area and Umm el-Jimal was abandoned like other towns and villages. The village remained uninhabited for nearly eleven hundred years until the modern community developed in the twentieth century.\n\nPrehistory\nLittle is known of pre-historical times in Umm el-Jimal, aside from the few scattered remains of what appear to be settlements of nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes. In some of these places it is possible to find chert knapping stones and some prehistoric tools. In the nearby wadis the remains of kites, which are large animal traps, have been found. The prehistoric people would have used these to catch large groups of animals at once.\n\nNabataean\nThe Nabataean peoples were the first to build permanent homesteads in the area in the first century AD. The settlement was mainly a farming community and a trading outpost dependent on Bostra, the nearby capital of the Nabataeans. Though the evidence for this village survives only in fragments, there are numerous Nabataean inscriptions from this period, mostly tomb stones. At least two men mentioned on these served as members of the Bostra City Council.\n\nEarly Roman\nAs the Romans continued their conquest of the surrounding areas, the Nabataean king saw his state's demise as inevitable, so he ceded his kingdom to the Roman emperor Trajan in AD 106. The Romans named the newly acquired territory Provincia Arabia and promptly set up local governments. The Praetorium, so named by H. C. Butler in 1905, may have been built for this purpose in the third century AD.\n\nLate Roman\nEverything changed after the rebellion led by Queen Zenobia of Palmyra in 275. The local people were no longer allowed to govern themselves, but had to submit to harsh foreign rule. Due to its location on the fringe of the Empire, Umm el-Jimal became a military outpost complete with a garrison and a new Tetrarchic-era fort. As Roman imperial power began to diminish, this earlier castellum lost its military function, and Umm el-Jimal gradually transformed from a military station to a civilian town. Paradoxically, from the point of view of the local Arab residents of the Hauran, this change may have been viewed as liberation rather than decline.\n\nByzantine\nThe Roman provincial administrators were replaced by Byzantine rulers in the 5th century. One of the rulers, Dux Pelagius, built smaller military quarters. These quarters were the later castellum, which is now known as the Barracks. As the local population gradually converted to Christianity the town reemerged as a prosperous agricultural and trading community. The 150 houses still standing today were constructed in this period, the fifth and sixth centuries. In the sixth century there was an explosion of church construction, 15 of which can still be seen today. The population continued to grow, reaching an estimated 6,000 inhabitants. In the seventh century, however, power of the region was ceded to the Islamic Umayyad Empire.\n\nUmayyad\nThe Islamic era at Umm el-Jimal began in 640 when the Rashidun Caliphs took control of the area. Much remodeling was done throughout the site so as to repurpose buildings to suit their own needs. The Praetorium and House XVIII are examples of buildings repurposed as dwelling places, while House 53 was possibly repurposed into a mosque. Despite all of this, the population decreased and the site was slowly abandoned with the help of an earthquake in circa 749 that destroyed many buildings and set much of the architecture off balance. The site was completely deserted under the Abbasid Caliphs in the ninth century.\n\nArab Revolt\nT. E. Lawrence wrote of \"ruined Um el Jemal\", \"There seemed evidence of bluntness of mind in these Roman frontier cities, Um el Jemal, Um el Surab, Umtaiye. Such incongruous buildings, in what was then and now a desert cockpit, accused their builders of insensitiveness; almost of a vulgar assertion of man's right (Roman right) to live unchanged in all his estate.\"\n\nReligion\nNabataean\nThere are a number of altars to Nabataean gods located on the site of Petra, including Dushara Aarra. Dushara, a god of Petra, is linked to Aarra, the patron god of Bostra, who become a unique regional deity. Both the Nabataean and Greek versions of his name can be seen inscribed on the die (middle section) of an altar, found in the western area of the ruins. Another god present at the site is Zeus Epikoos, a mixture of Zeus and the local deity Epikoos. In this case an altar was found in a courtyard, representative of a regional god. The altar found at Umm el-Jimal suggests personal devotion by a local resident to this deity. The third deity found at Umm el-Jimal is Solmos, who is not known elsewhere and may also be a local deity, perhaps only worshipped by the people of Umm el-Jimal and the immediate surrounding area. His name is found only once, on an altar inscription in the main ruins of Umm el-Jimal. Because this is the only known evidence of the worship of Solmos, it is reasonable to believe his worshipers were relatively few and localized. There is evidence on tombstones and small altars scattered throughout the site that suggests the worship of other deities, perhaps personal or familial gods not worshiped communally.\n\nEarly Roman Pagan\nDue to the tolerant nature of the early Roman occupation, little was contested during this period. The people of the region were able to continue their religious practices they had followed prior to the Roman occupation. Thus, it is likely that many of the regional gods like Zeus Epikoos and Solmos were still worshiped as the local deities.\n\nLate Roman\nAfter the rebellion of Palmyra most of the regional religious practices stopped altogether. This was due to harsh restrictions that were implemented by the Roman government to ensure that the people would not rise up again. There is evidence however, that a small Roman shrine surviving in House 49 may have served the garrison that was stationed in the Tetrarchic castellum.\n\nChristianity/Byzantium\nThe Byzantine Empire is representative of the Christianization of the Roman Empire by Constantine in the early fourth century AD. The change in religious affiliation influenced even the far reaches of the Empire, and is therefore evident here in Umm el-Jimal. Christian symbols can be found throughout the site carved into stone and by the architectural influences. The doctrinal shift in clergy-laity (parishioner) relations is represented by the addition of altar screens in the front of the churches and narthexes to their entries. Besides Christianity's influence through the construction of multiple churches on the site, some complexes may have had monastic use. The later castellum (Barracks) was converted into a monastery by the addition of a chapel to the main building. The towers, which were also added, are inscribed with the names of the four archangels and other Christian inscriptions. The inscriptions give the impression that these successful residents relied for protection more directly on God, to whom they felt close, rather than on an emperor who seemed so far away.\n\nIslam\nUmayyad Umm el-Jimal appears to have been part Christian and part Muslim with the two religious groups coexisting under the policy of the Dhimma. Scholars debate the idea that some of the churches in Umm el-Jimal were converted into mosques. In these former churches, the apse was blocked off and the focus of the structure's space was shifted south towards Mecca. Whether this is the case or not, it is more evident that two houses were converted to mosques with typically Umayyad plans and a small tower on the exterior of its west face indicating the presence of a minaret. The predominant Muslim modern community is served by several newly constructed mosques outside the antiquities.\n\nLocation\nThe village of Umm el-Jimal is located in the semi-arid region of Jordan known as the Southern Hauran, at the western edge of the desert Badiya region. The area consists mainly of the igneous rock basalt, which was used as the primary building material. Basalt also served as a natural insulation which was extremely important in the area. In the cool winter months the basalt blocks would trap the heat from the sun and then radiate that heat throughout the structure, thus acting as a natural heating source. In the hot summer months it would serve as a cooling unit because the dense nature of the blocks trapped the cool air within the structure, despite the fact that temperatures exceed 100 °F. The volcanic nature of the soil has made it one of the most fertile areas in Jordan and Syria.\n\nDemographics\nThe estimated population during the Nabataean period is unknown, because evidence of a residential community was obliterated by the later construction phases. However, because the town was likely a major trading post along the same route as Bostra, the population could have been several thousand strong. Numerous Nabataean and Greek tombstones testify to their presence. Based on the number of structures, the peak population was likely in the sixth century perhaps 3,000–7,000 people. In the Byzantine and Umayyad periods houses were occupied by both people and pastoral animals. In the Umayyad period a smaller number survived at Umm el-Jimal. While some buildings were not occupied, it was still a prosperous place and some new farmstead-type houses were constructed with characteristic Umayyad mangers. By 900, the town was abandoned. It is unknown as to why, but it was most likely due to the same reasons that the greater population of the wider region of Syria decreased; i.e., plague, drought, earthquakes, etc. Aside from these basic numbers, the general range of poor to wealthy households is largely unknown for most of the different eras of occupation. The location of the site suggests that it was rather small, but the number of buildings and churches suggest otherwise.\n\nArchaeology\nUmm el-Jimal was rediscovered in the nineteenth century, during a time of Western interest in antiquities. The first systematic survey was completed by the Princeton University Expedition to Southern Syria in 1905 and 1909. \nThe first recorded visit to the site was by William John Bankes (1786–1855) in 1818 who conducted a brief description of Umm el-Jimal. Between 1818 and 1905, many Westerners passed through the site and made a few recordings but all were brief and inconclusive. \nHoward Crosby Butler led the Princeton Expedition and his papers (PES II: 151) contain a more exhaustive account of those who came to Umm el-Jimal between 1818 and 1905. Butler remained at the site for two weeks mapping the site and drawing diagrams of several of the buildings. Butler's work has proved invaluable in guiding others to the site and in garnering further interest in studying the site. His survey of 1905 provided the groundwork for the field work still being conducted today.\nG. Corbett came to Umm el-Jimal in 1956 to study the Julianos Church and much of his work corrected the mistakes made by Butler. Corbett also refined how Umm el-Jimal is thought of today by demonstrating that many of the buildings were constructed reusing pieces from earlier buildings. In 1972 comprehensive work was started at Umm el-Jimal by Bert de Vries of Calvin College. The ancient village was further mapped out and detailed work conducted refining the theories surrounding the nature and history of the village. The work has included conservation practices. In 1977, the walls of the Barracks were fortified with cement to prevent more collapse. The gate area of House XVIII was also fortified in 1983 with modern cement. Excavations were conducted during field work between 1972 and 1998, though the nature of the excavations was for survey and research and not for uncovering buried ruins. Since 1998 the work has centered on presentation and visual documentation of the site. Started in 2009, efforts are currently being conducted to make the site more presentable to the public. A significant component of this effort is the development of a virtual museum with site tours, a compilation of the research and publications, and presentation of the heritage of the modern community and its relationship to the antiquities.\nIn 2014, extensive damage was done to the site by tomb raiders. Sparked by rumors of gold, looters have destroyed many tombs. \"The looters are looking not only for gold but for ceramics, glassware, lamps, masonry and bits of jewelry, all of which quickly find their way into the global antiquities trade.\"\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\nA request for UNESCO world heritage status was submitted in 2022. In July 2024, Umm el-Jimal was admitted during the 46th session held in India.\n\nSee also\nKhirbet es-Samra\nList of World Heritage Sites in Jordan\nTourism in Jordan\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n\nEnno Littmann, David Magie Jr. and Duane Reed Stuart, Greek and Latin Inscriptions - The Umm el-Jimal Project.

          "content": "Madaba (Arabic: مادبا; Biblical Hebrew: מֵידְבָא‎ Mēḏəḇāʾ; Ancient Greek: Μήδαβα) is the capital city of Madaba Governorate in central Jordan, with a population of about 60,000. It is best known for its Byzantine and Umayyad mosaics, especially a large Byzantine-era mosaic map of the Holy Land. Madaba is located 30 kilometres (19 miles) south-west of the capital Amman.\n\nHistory\nBronze Age\nMadaba dates from the Middle Bronze Age.\n\nIron Age\nThe town of Madaba was once a Moabite border city, mentioned in the Bible in Numbers 21:30 and Joshua 13:9. Control over the city changed back and forth between Israel and Moab, as mentioned in the Mesha Stele.\n\nClassical Antiquity\nDuring its rule by the Roman and Byzantine empires from the 2nd to the 7th centuries, the city formed part of the province of Arabia Petraea set up by the Roman Emperor Trajan to replace the Nabataean kingdom of Petra.\nThe first evidence for a Christian community in the city, with its own bishop, is found in the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon in 451, where Constantine, Metropolitan Archbishop of Bostra (the provincial capital) signed on behalf of Gaiano, \"Bishop of the Medabeni.\" It was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate in 629 after the Battle of Mut'ah.\nDuring the rule of the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate, it was part of the southern district of Jund Filastin within the Bilad al-Sham province.\n\nModern settlement\nIn 1880, 90 Arab Christian families from Al Karak resettled the ruins of Madaba, led by two Italian priests from the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The Christian families had petitioned the Turkish government to be allowed to resettle Madaba, by then just large tell after tensions arose with Muslim families in Al Karak. The government also gave the permission for the rebuilding of churches on the sites of ancient churches from antiquity. In 1884, it was the clearance of debris from one such site that led to the uncovering of the 6th-century Madaba Map mosaic.\nThe Catholic Church's list of titular sees uses the spelling \"Medaba\", in reference to the ancient bishopric located in this city, while referring to the modern city as \"Madaba\".\nToday, the city is the seat of Madaba Governorate and is the 9th-biggest city in Jordan, with a population of 122,008 as of 2021.\n\nArchaeological finds\nIn Madaba city\nThe first mosaics were discovered during the building of new houses using bricks from older buildings. The new inhabitants of Madaba, made conscious of the importance of the mosaics by their priests, made sure that they took care of and preserved all the mosaics that came to light.\nThe northern part of the city turned out to be the area containing the greatest concentration of mosaics. During the Byzantine-Umayyad period, this northern area, crossed by a colonnaded Roman road, saw the building of the Church of the Map, the Hippolytus Mansion, the Church of the Virgin Mary, the Church of Prophet Elijah with its crypt, the Church of the Holy Martyrs (Al-Khadir), the Burnt Palace, the Church of the Sunna' family, and the church of the salaita family.\n\nThe Madaba Map mosaic was discovered in 1884 during the construction of the church of St. George, but was only properly investigated more than a decade later in 1896 after it was witnessed by Father Kleopas Koikyides, the librarian of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem. In 1897, he published a reliable sketch and his findings on the relic in a commentary in Greek entitled: The Geographical Madaba Mosaic Map on Syria, Palestine and Egypt.\nThe Madaba Map dates from the 6th century and is preserved in the floor of the modern Greek Orthodox Basilica of Saint George, sometimes also called the \"Church of the Map\". With two million pieces of coloured stone, the map depicts hills and valleys, villages and towns in Palestine and the Nile Delta. The mosaic contains the earliest extant representation of Byzantine Jerusalem, labeled the \"Holy City.\" The map provides important details about its 6th-century landmarks, with the cardo, or central colonnaded street, and the church of the Holy Sepulchre clearly visible. This map is one key in developing scholarly knowledge about the physical layout of Jerusalem after its destruction and rebuilding in 70 AD.\nOther mosaic masterpieces found in the Church of the Virgin and the Apostles and the Archaeological Museum, depict a profusion of flowers and plants, birds and fish, animals and exotic beasts, as well as scenes from mythology and everyday pursuits of hunting, fishing and farming. Hundreds of other mosaics from the 5th through the 7th centuries are scattered throughout Madaba.\nThe University of Toronto has been excavating in Madaba from 1996 until the present. Their efforts have focused primarily on the west acropolis where an open field has allowed access to uncover the entire sequence of occupation at Madaba from the modern period down to the Early Bronze Age levels. The most visible feature of this area is a 7.5-meter-wide (25 ft) fortification wall built sometime in the 9th century BC, with subsequent rebuilds throughout its history. There is also the remains of a well-preserved Byzantine-era house at the base of the fortification wall.\nIn 2010, a 3,000-year-old Iron Age temple containing several figurines of ancient deities and circular clay vessels used in Moabite religious rituals was discovered at Khirbat 'Ataroz near Mabada.\n\nIn Khirbat Ataruz\nKhirbat Ataruz, also known as Ataroth, is mentioned prominently in the Mesha stele and its ruins are located in Madaba Governorate, outside of Madaba city. It was conquered by Israelite King Omri, as discussed in the Mesha stele, Book of Numbers 32, and 2nd Books of Kings 3:4–27. The oldest inscription in the Moabite language script, dated to the late 9th or early 8th century BC, was found at Khirbat Ataruz.\n\nMadaba Institute for Mosaic Art and Restoration\nThe Institute of Mosaic Art and Restoration was founded in 1992 as the Madaba Mosaic School, and funded by the Italian government. It was a high school which offered the Tawjihi, the Jordanian equivalent of a high school diploma. In 2007, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, under the Department of Antiquities, partnered with USAID's Siyaha tourism development project, and the Italian government to launch the institute as a two-year, post-secondary educational program. The institute offers diplomas in Mosaic Art Production and Restoration. The institute is located between the Madaba Visitors Center and the Madaba Archaeological Park.\n\nClimate\nMadaba has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa). Most rain falls in the winter. The average annual temperature in Madaba is 16.4 °C (61.5 °F). About 346 mm (13.62 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nPoints of interest\nMadaba's main attraction is its Byzantine mosaics, drawing many visitors, especially since the creation of an archaeological park. They cover the floors of houses and churches dating from the site's earliest period of habitation.\nSouthwest of Madaba is Hammamat Ma'in (Ma'in Hot Springs), thermal mineral springs that for centuries have attracted people for its purported therapeutic properties.\nThe nearby site of Umm ar-Rasas, south-east of Madaba on the edge of the semi-arid steppe, started as a Roman military camp and grew to become a town from the 5th century. It also has very large and well-preserved mosaics.\nAt the southern entrance to Madaba, near the King's Highway, is the Church of the Apostles. The ruins of this Byzantine church date to 578 CE, and are currently being restored. It includes a mosaic known as the \"Personification of the Sea\", depicting a woman emerging from the sea, surrounded by mythical aquatic creatures and a hodgepodge of rams, bulls, parrots and exotic vegetation. The mosaic was signed by a mosaicist named Salamanios.\n \nA weaving project started by twelve women of the Bani Hamida tribe in 1985 produces woven items in traditionally bright colors. Traditional ground looms, assembled using stones and sticks, are used for the weaving, and the products can be found at numerous outlets in Jordan and abroad. Visitors can stop by the weaving rooms, located in the village of Mukawir, to see how the rugs are made. The women also make decorative candles.\nThe American University of Madaba opened in 2011, and is located on a 100-acre campus outside the city.\n\nInternational relations\nTwin towns – sister cities\nMadaba is twinned with:\n\n Bethlehem, Palestine\n Denton, Texas\n\nSee also\nEarly Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East\nIsaiah 15\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nRantzow, George Louis Albert, de (German name Georg Ludwig Albrecht von Rantzau, often named Jørgen Ludvig Albert de Rantzow).

          "content": "مادبا أو مأدبا مدينة تقع في وسط المملكة الأردنيّة الهاشميّة، وهي مركز محافظة مادبا. تبعد 33 كيلومترًا جنوب غرب العاصمة عمّان، وترتفع عن مستوى سطح البحر بحوالي 770 مترًا. بلغ عدد سكانها في عام 2015 حوالي 105,353 نسمة، حيث تُعتبر تاسع أكبر مدينة في المملكة.\nأسس المؤابيّون المدينة في القرن الثالث عشر قبل الميلاد، حيث كانت جزءًا من مملكتهم الممتدة شرق نهر الأردن. كما توالى عليها العديد من الحضارات التي حكمت المنطقة. كما لعبت دورًا بارزًا بعد أن احتلها البيزنطيّون، إذ ضمّت عددًا من الكنائس التاريخيّة الهامّة. وتعد المدينة اليوم، من أكثر الأماكن أهميّةً لأتباع الديانة المسيحيّة، بسبب وجود تلك المعالم الدينيّة. كما يقع في محيطها الكثير من المواقع الأثريّة والأماكن المقدسة المتمثّلة بمواقع الحج المسيحي مثل المغطس، جبل نيبو، مكاور وأم الرصاص، مما يجعل منها مقصدًا للسيّاح. علمًا بأن أهمية مادبا في القرون الأولى للمسيحية كانت مثل أهمية مدينة القدس كأهم مركز للحياة المسيحية في شرق الأردن، حيث ذُكرت في الإنجيل، إلا أنها تعرضت للدمار نتيجة للزلزال العنيف الذي لحق بالمنطقة عام 749، وزلازل أخرى تلته. ولكن القبائل العربية المسيحية من منطقة الكرك أعادت إحياءها واستوطنتها ابتداءً من عام 1880 م، حيث يسكنها اليوم المسيحيون والمسلمون على حد سواء.\nاشتهرت مادبا كثيرًا بالفسيفساء، وهي واحدة من أهم المدن الحرفيّة في العالم بهذا الفن، حيث تشتهر المدينة بإرث خاص في أزقتها وكنائسها البيزنطيّة القديمة ومساجدها وعمارتها الفريدة. كما تحوي المعهد الوحيد في العالم لتعليم هذا الفن، حتى سُميت بمدينة الفسيفساء. وتُعد خارطة مادبا من أهم الآثار الفسيسفائية في المدينة.\nتأسس أول مجلس بلدي للمدينة في عام 1912، وهو اليوم تحت اسم بلدية مادبا الكبرى، التي تقع ضمن حدودها خمسة مناطق، تكوّن حدود مدينة مادبا الممتدة على حوالي 54 كيلومترًا مربعًا. وقد أُعلن عن فوز المدينة بلقب عاصمة السياحة العربيّة لعام 2022، بعد تحقيقها للمعايير والشروط المرجعيّة كافة.\n\nالتسمية\nلم يتغير اسم مادبا عبر المراحل التاريخيّة المختلفة، إلا بشكل طفيف في اللفظ، مما يعطي دلالة واضحة ومهمة على تاريخ المدينة. كما يلفظ أهل المنطقة اسم المدينة بألف ممدودة دون همزة، وهو الاسم الذي أصبح متعارفًا عليه في المنطقة.\nيعود أصل تسمية مدينة مادبا إلى عدة احتمالات (يُطلق عليها باليونانية: Μαντάμπα)، فهناك احتمال أن الكلمة سريانية، وتعني «مكان الطين» أو «المياه الهادئة»، لأن المياه تستقر عادة حول المدينة. ويوجد احتمال آخر هو أن الاسم آرامي، حيث تتكون مادبا من كلمتين؛ هما «ميا» د «أيب»، فالكلمة الأولى تعني المياه والثانية تعني الفاكهة، وحرف الدال للإضافة فيكون معناه مياه الفاكهة. كما يوجد احتمال ثالث، وهو أن مادبا كانت بالأصل «ميدبا»، وهو اسم مؤابي يعني مياه الراحة، وأنه ربما كان مأخوذًا من كثرة عدد برك المياه التي كانت تحيط بالمدينة.\nكما ذُكرت في الإنجيل بهذا الاسم، والتي تُعد من أقدم المدن المؤابية. وقد بقي كما هو في جميع المصادر القديمة التي ذكره دون تحريف، حتى العصر الحديث.\n\nالتاريخ\nالتاريخ القديم\nورد اسم مادبا وجوارها في العديد من الكتابات التاريخيّة القديمة، والكتب السماوية، كالتوراة والإنجيل والأسفار. وجاء فيها اسم «ميداب» و«حشبون» (حسبان) و«ذيبون» (ذيبان) وجبل نيبو و«بعل معون» (ماعين) ومكاور ووادي الوالة، وغيرها من المواقع المهمّة، إضافة إلى النقوش والشواهد الأثريّة العديدة، والتي يُستدل منها أن المدينة كانت إحدى المدن العامرة في الأزمان القديمة، وأن لها تاريخًا يعود إلى حضارة المؤابيين وعدة ممالك أخرى حكمتها.\n\nظهر في بدايات القرن الثالث عشر قبل الميلاد في منطقة شرق الأردن عدة ممالك ودويلات كانت ذات طابع محلي، هي ممالك المؤابيين والعمّونيين والأدوميين والأموريين. وكانت مادبا ضمن أراضي مملكة مؤاب، التي امتدت أراضيها في وادي الموجب شمالاً إلى الحسا جنوبًا. إلا أن حدود تلك الممالك لم تكن ثابتة، بل كانت تتغير وتتبدل بين الفترة والأخرى، وذلك تبعًا لطبيعة الأحوال السياسيّة السائدة في هذه الممالك. وهذا يعني أن منطقة مادبا وجوارها قد تبادلت السيطرة عليها في بعض الأحيان دول غير المؤابيين، كالأموريين والعمّونيين. وكانت تلك الفترة نفسها التي خرج منها بنو إسرائيل من مصر في فترة النبي موسى، الذين وقعت بينهم وبين المؤابيين عدة معارك، تمكن بعدها الملك العبري عمري الانتصار والسيطرة على عدة مناطق مؤابية، كانت منها مادبا. ولكن تبعية مملكة مؤاب للملك عمري لم تدم طويلا، حيث انتصر عليه الملك ميشع، وتمكن من استعادة قوة مؤاب وطرد بني إسرائيل منها. ولقد خلّدت مسلة ميشع تلك الانتصارات.\nلقد لعب موقع مادبا تاريخيًا دور كبير في أهميتها، حيث كانت إحدى محطات طريق الملوك الذي يربط مصر ببلاد الشام، حيث يُعتبر أحد أقدم وأهم الطرق التجارية في منطقة الشرق الأوسط. كما اعتمد المؤابيون وغيرهم من الأقوام في الدول القديمة على هذا الطريق للتجارة. كانت السيطرة على هذا الطريق من أهم أسباب المعارك التي حدثت بين بني إسرائيل والممالك الواقعة شرق نهر الأردن. وقد ورد في الكتاب المقدس بعهده القديم عندما زحفت جيوش حلف مؤلف من أربعة من ملوك الشمال على طول هذا الطريق لمحاربة الملوك مدن بسهل الخمس بما في ذلك مدينتا سدوم وعمورة، وهو الطريق الذي تمنى موسى أن يسلكه مع قومه عبر أرض إدوم للحصول على أرض كنعان.\nخضعت مادبا بعد فترة للسيطرة الآرامية، ثم احتلها الآشوريون، الذين أعطوا الحكم للمؤابيين ليحكموا أنفسهم بأنفسهم مقابل إعطاء الجزية. وعندما تغلب البابليون على الآشوريين، سيطروا على جميع مناطقهم، ومنها مؤاب. وقد قام القائد نبوخذنصر بالهجوم على حسبان وذبح أهلها، وذلك بعد هجومه على القدس والسبي البابلي الأول. وقد تراجعت مؤاب بعد ذلك.\nخضعت المنطقة بعد ذلك للغزو الفارسي، ثم احتلها الاسكندر المقدوني عام 332 ق.م، فأدخل إلى المنطقة بعض مظاهر الحضارة اليونانية. استمر هذا الأمر حتى دخول الأنباط المدينة في القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد، حيث تمكن الملك الحارث الأول من استرجاع مادبا وجوارها وضمها لمملكته. وأسند الأنباط إدارة مادبا وجوارها إلى بني يعمر.\n\nالرومان والبيزنطيون\nخضعت مادبا لسيطرة الرومان في بداية القرن الثاني، وأصبحت ضمن المقاطعة العربية البترائية. لقد جعل الرومان مادبا مدينة نموذجيّة بامتياز، فبنوا الشوارع المعمّدة، والمعابد، ومباني أخرى. كما أقاموا أحواض ماء ضخمة وسوراً يحصنها. لقد تم الحفاظ على جزء من شوارع مدينة مادبا الرومانيّة في منتزه مادبا الأثري، حيث يقطع الشارع الروماني القديم، وهو من أبرز عناصر المتنزه، المدينة من الشرق إلى الغرب، ويقود إلى بوابات أسوارها القديمة، ويمتد مدفونا تحت الأرض لمسافة طويلة خارج المنتزه. كما أعاد الرومان إنشاء طريق الملوك الي يمر بمادبا، وتحديدًا في فترة الإمبراطور تراجان. وقد اُطلق عليه اسم \"Via Traiana Nova\"، كما تم إكماله في فترة الإمبراطور هادريان. لقد تم استخدام الطريق فيما بعد من قبل الحجاج المسيحيين القادمين إلى فلسطين والأردن، لكونه يمر من عدة أماكن مسيحية مهمة، بما فيها جبل نيبو، والمغطس على نهر الأردن.\nلقد ازدهرت مادبا في الفترة البيزنطيّة، خاصةً بعد انتشار المسيحيّة في المنطقة، حيث اعتنقها أحد الزعماء العرب من قبائل الضجاعمة، وتأصّلت فيها أيام الغساسنة سنة 292 م. وكانت مادبا ومكاور وحسبان من أهم المقاطعات العربيّة في تلك الفترة. كما أصبحت المدينة بعد ذلك إحدى مدن المقاطعة الثالثة في عهد ثيودوسيس الفلسطيني. وقد عُين لمادبا أسقف اسمه قايوناس الثاني في حوالي سنة 451 م. كما وُجدت العديد من الآثار الكنسيّة إبان تلك الفترة. ومن أهم هذه الكنائس كنيسة الخارطة. ولعل انتشار بناء الكنائس في مادبا في هذه الفترة أعطي دلالة مهمة تدل أن سكانها كانوا بأعداد كبيرة، ساعد ذلك في الرخاء الاقتصادي في مادبا.\nاشتهرت مادبا كثيرًا بالفسيفساء، حتى سُميت بمدينة الفسيفساء. ومن أهم الآثار الفسيسفائية في المدينة خارطة مادبا. وهي جزء من أرضية فسيفسائية لكنيسة قديمة. وهي أقدم خريطة أصلية للأراضي المقدسة، والتي يعود إنشاؤها إلى سنة 560. توجد اليوم داخل كنيسة القديس جوارجيوس في مدينة مادبا، والتي بُنيت في عام 1896 فوق بقايا الكنيسة البيزنطية. تمتد خريطة مادبا على جزء من أرضية الكنيسة، وتُقدر أبعادها بنحو 15.75 عرضا 5.60 طولا، وتشكل مدينة القدس مركزا لها. وتظهر فيها مواقع في فلسطين والأردن وسوريا ولبنان ومصر.\n\nالحكم الإسلامي\nلقد تمكّن المسلمون من فتح مادبا بعد الفتح الإسلامي للشام عام 637 م، ولم يُجبر أحد على تغيير دينه، حيث استمر الكثير من سكان المدينة باعتنقاء المسيحية. وقد مرّ الخليفة عمر بن الخطاب بمادبا في طريقه لفتح القدس، كما تم بناء مسجد المدينة في المنطقة التي صلى فيها، وهي منطقة الخطابية التي سُميت باسمه فيما بعد. كما تم بناء العديد من الكنائس في بداية الحكم الإسلامي للمنطقة، وتحديدًا في فترة الدولة الأمويّة.\nلقد ساهم أبناء مادبا أيضًا في تزيين القصور الصحراويّة التابعة للخلفاء الأمويين، كقصر عمرة وقصر هشام في أريحا، كما أن معظم الإنتاج الفسيفسائي جرى في تلك الفترة، كما في كنيسة مريم العذراء، وغيرها. إلاّ أن المدينة تعرضت لعدة كوارث طبيعية كالزلازل، ألحقت بها أضرارًا كبيرة، كان أكبرها زلزال عام 749 م، والذي أدى إلى دمار كبير بالمدينة، ومدن أخرى في فلسطين والأردن.\nلقد أكسب موقع مادبا الإستراتيجي والقريب من طريق الحج الشامي أهمية خاصة لدى المماليك، فقد كانت من أشهر المحطات في العصر المملوكي في منطقة البلقاء، وقريبة من المحطات الأخرى في حسبان، ذيبان، وزيزيا. إلاّ أن أهميتها قد فُقدت لصالح جارتها حسبان لسنوات عديدة. حيث تم إلحاق أراضي مادبا بالأخيرة حتى القرن التاسع عشر، حتى عادت إلى مكانتها.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nظلّت أهميّة المدينة متواضعة حتى قدوم بعض من العشائر المسيحيّة من الكرك ابتداءً من عام 1880، فأحيوها من جديد بعدما استوطنوها. كما شُيِّدت عدد من المباني الإداريّة بعد ذلك، كان أهمّها دار السرايا العثمانيّة المبنيّة في عام 1896. كما شُيِّد عدد من المباني الدينيّة من الكنائس والمساجد في تلك الفترة وما بعدها في مواقع أثريّة هامّة، فتم بناء كنيسة قطع رأس يوحنا المعمدان (دير اللاتين) في سنة 1883، وكنيسة القديس جاورجيوس سنة 1896، في حين بُنِي مسجد الملك حسين في 2007، تلى ذلك نمو في السكان بشكل متسارع حول دور العبادة تلك.\nكانت مادبا وجوارها تتبع لقضاء السلط الواقع ضمن متصرفيّة الكرك سنة 1872. وقد شهدت المنطقة تغيرات إداريّة مستمرّة، حيث أنشأت الدولة العثمانيّة أول ناحية في الجيزة، ثم ناحية الثمد، وقد انتقل مركز هذه الناحية فيما بعد إلى مادبا، واستقر الأمر نهائيًا على إنشاء ثلاث نواحٍ في المنطقة هي: ناحية الجيزة وناحية عمّان وناحية مادبا. كما تأسّس أول مجلس بلدي بالمدينة عام 1912. لقد تطورت مادبا بعد استقلال الأردن عام 1946 كغيرها من المدن الأردنية تطورًا لافتًا في أكثر من صعيد. وعلى المستوى الإداري والتنظيمي، تحوّلت من قضاء إلى لواء إلى أن أصبحت أخيرًا بمستوى مركز لإحدى محافظات الأردن الاثنتي عشرة، يتبع إليها لواء ذيبان وعدد من الأقضية.\nتجدر الإشارة إلى أن المدينة تضم عدّة متاحف تحكي تاريخها، منها متحف مادبا الأثري ومتحف الحكاية التراثي في جبل نيبو ومنتزه مادبا الأثري. وقد زار منطقة مادبا ثلاثة من البابوات، حجوّا إلى موقع مغطس المسيح، وهم البابا جون بول الثاني، حيث زار المنطقة في آذار/ مارس 2000. بعد ذلك البابا بنديكتوس السادس عشر في أيار/ مايو 2009، عندما أسس لبناء الكنيسة اللاتينيّة اليونانيّة الملكيين الجديدة. أما ثالث زيارة، فكانت من قبل البابا فرنسيس في أيار/ مايو 2014.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقعُ مدينة مادبا على مسافة 33 كيلومترًا جنوبَ العاصمة الأردنيّة عمّان، على دائرة العرض 31ْ شمالاً، وخط الطول 35ْ شرقاً. وتصلُ مساحة المدينة إلى حوالي 54 كيلومتراً مُربَّعاً. تتكون مدينة مادبا من خمسة مناطق تشرف عليها بلديّة مادبا الكبرى وتقع ضمن حدودها؛ هي منطقة جرينة والوسية، منطقة غرناطة والعريش، منطقة ماعين والمنشية، منطقة الفيصلية، ومنطقة المريجمات والحوية. ومن ناحية إدارية، تعتبر المدينة مركز قضاء مادبا وكذلك محافظة مادبا، التي تُعَدّ واحدةً من محافظات الأردن الإثني عشر.\nتحدٌّ المدينة من جهة الشمال الشرقي عمَّان، حيث يمكن الوصول منها إلى مادبا عبر محورين؛ الأول عبر طريق مادبا الشرقي (طريق 35) الذي يخترق المدينة من جهة مطار الملكة علياء الدولي في الشرق، متجهًا إلى الجنوب. أما المحور الثاني، فهو طريق مادبا الغربي، الذي يربط المدينة بالعاصمة عبر ناعور. أما من الجنوب، فيحد المدينة محافظة الكرك، وتشرف على البحر الميت من جهة الغرب. كما يمكن الوصول إلى مادبا عبر طرق ثانوية من المناطق المحيطة بها، كطريق أم الرصاص جنوبًا، وطريق ماعين من الجنوب الغربي، وطريق جبل نيبو من الشمال الغربي. وتتموضعُ المدينة - جغرافيًا - في منطقة هضاب البلقاء، وبذلك فإنَّها تتبعُ إقليم حوض البحر الأبيض المتوسط، حيث تبعد عنها القدس 53 كيلومترًا إلى الغرب، بينما تبعد عنها دمشق 200 كيلومترًا إلى الشمال.\nتقعُ المدينة على سهلٍ زراعي خصب في ربوة طبيعية، حيثُ لا زالت تشغلُ نفس الموقع الذي استوطنه الناسُ فيها منذ العصور القديمة. كما تمتاز المنطقة عمومًا بتنوع تضاريسها، حيث تشتهر بسهولها الواسعة المنبسطة، والتي تعمل على رفد المملكة بكميات وافرة من الحبوب، إضافة إلى مناطقها الغورية والشفا غورية، والتي تعتبر من أهم مصادر إنتاج الخضراوات والفواكه والزيتون.\n\nالتضاريس\nيرتفع سطح منطقة مادبا ارتفاعًا تدريجيًا نحو الغرب، حتى يشرف على وادي الأردن والبحر الميت، وذلك بانحدار شديد، وفي المقابل ينحدر سطح الأرض ببطء شديد بالاتجاه شرقًا، حتى يكاد ان يتلاشى الانحدار عند نهاية حدوده الشرقية. وبذلك تشكل مادبا هضبة متموجة السطح. وتتميز تضاريس مادبا بالتعقد باتجاه الغرب، بينما تنساب سهولها بالاتجاه نحو الشرق، تتخللها بعض التلال والمرتفعات المتفرقة، والتي لا يزيد ارتفاعها عن 900 متر فوق مستوى سطح البحر.\n\nالمناخ\nتمتازُ مدينة مادبا بمناخٍ شبه رطب يميلُ للجفاف. وتسودُ فيها الرِّياح الغربية عامَّة، والرِّياح الشمالية الغربية خصوصاً. وتمتازُ، مثل باقي الأردن، برياحٍ باردة وجافَّة شتاءً، ومعتدلة ورطبة صيفاً. وقد تهبّ أحياناً على المدينة رياحٌ شرقية أو شمالية شرقية، قد تحملُ معها عواصف رمليَّة مُحمَّلة بذرَّات الغُبَار. ويبغُ متوسِّط سرعة الرياح 15 كيلومتراً/الساعة، وقد يصلُ - بأحيانٍ مُعيَّنة - إلى 120 كم/ساعة.\nتتفاوتُ معدَّلات الأمطار في مدينة مادبا على مدار السَّنة وخلال الفصول بدرجةٍ كبيرة، وذلك نظراً إلى تأثير المنخفضات الجويَّة على الطَّقسِ فيها. وبصورةٍ عامة يمتدّ موسم الأمطار من شهر تشرين الأول/ أكتوبر إلى أيار/ مايو، ويبلغ معدل الهطول فيه حوالي 100 ملم أو أكثر، وهي تقعُ في نطاقٍ شبه رطب. وتتراوحُ الرطوبة - بالمثل - على مدار العام، وما بين اللَّيل والنَّهار، وذلك تأثراً بنوع الكتل الهوائية ودرجات الحرارة. ويبلغُ وسطيّ الرطوبة النسبية في لمدية وجوارها 58%، إلا أنَّه قد ينخفضُ في أوقاتٍ من العام (بين شهري مارس وأبريل) إلى 5% فحسب، فيما يترفعُ بأوقاتٍ أخرى (في شهر نوفمبر) إلى حدِّ 79%.\n\nالسكان\nحسب إحصاء سُكَّان الأردن لسنة 2015، يبلغ عدد سُكَّان مدينة مادبا 105,353 نسمة، حيث بلغت النسبة الذكور من بينهم حوالي 53% والإناث 47%، وأما عددُ الأسر فقد زادَ عن واحدٍ وعشرين ألف أسرة. وتعود جذور التركيبة السكانيّة لمدينة مادبا إلى القرن التاسع عشر، إذ إنَّ المدينة الحالية تأسَّست خلال تلك الفترة، نتيجة هجرة عددٍ كبيرٍ من العائلات المسيحيَّة من مدينة الكرك جنوباً واستقرارها في موقع مادبا المعاصر.\n\nفي ذلك الحين، كات الفئات المسيحيَّة تُمثِّل أغبية سُكَّان المدينة، ففي عام 1919، بلغ سُكَّان مادبا حوالي 2,000 نسمة منهم 87% من معتنقي الديانة المسيحية. إلا أنَّ عدد السكان المسيحيِّين تضاءل مع الوقتِ نتيجة قدوم الكثير من العائلات المسلمة إلى مادبا واستقرارها فيها خلال القرن العشرين، كما أنَّ نسبة تزايد السكان المسيحيِّين أقلُّ من أولئك المسلمين، وبالتالي فقد انخفضت نسبتهم مع الوقت. ففي إحصاء سنة 1969 ارتفع عدد السكان إلى 12,500 نسمة، إلا أنَّ نسبة المسيحيين منهم تدنَّت إلى 40%. وأما الآن فقد أصبحت نسبتهم تُقدَّر بما بَيْن 10 إلى 20% من أهالي مادبا فحسب، الذين تجاوز عددهم المائة ألف نسمة.\nيشّكل اللاجئون جزءًا من سكان مادبا، إذ استقبلت المدينة اللاجئين من الدول القريبة على مر العقود الماضية، حيث يوجد في الجزء الجنوبي منها مخيم مادبا للاجئين الفلسطينيين، والذي تأسس بعد نكبة فلسطين بأعوام، وتحديدًا عام 1956، ويبلغ عدد سكانه 5500 نسمة حسب قيود وكالة الغوث الدوليّة. كما تستضيف المدينة والمناطق المجاورة منها آلاف اللاجئين السوريين، يُقدر عددهم بحوالي 5000 لاجئ ومن الأيدي العاملة، أتوا إلى مادبا بعد الأزمة السورية، بالإضافة إلى مئات الأسر من اللاجئين العراقيين الذين ازدادت أعدادهم بعد احتلال العراق عام 2003.\n\nالاقتصاد\nيعتمد اقتصاد المدينة كثيرًا على إيرادات السياحة. فوجود العدد الكبير من الكنائس الأثريّة والمعالم المعماريّة التاريخيّة القريبة والمنتجعات الترفيهية القريبة بالإضافة إلى الأسواق والطرق التي تقع على جنباتها عشرات المحال من محترفي فن صناعة الفسيفساء ضمن مسار مادبا التراثي، جعلت من مدينة مادبا المدينة الحرفية الأولى في العالم في فن الفسيفساء دون منازع. وقد بلغ عدد السيّاح الذين زاروا المواقع السياحيّة المختلفة في مادبا وجوارها خلال شهر كانون الثاني/ يناير 2016 حوالي 5411 سائحًا وفق مديرية سياحة مادبا.\nمن جهة أخرى، يعمل جزء كبير من سكان المدينة بالزراعة، حيث تشتهر المنطقة بسهولها الواسعة المنبسطة، والتي تعمل على رفد المملكة بكميات وافرة من الحبوب، إضافة إلى مناطقها الغورية والشفا غورية، والتي تعتبر من أهم مصادر إنتاج الخضراوات والفواكه والزيتون. إلا المدينة وجوارها تشهد نهضة عمرانيّة كبيرة بسبب قربها من العاصمة وسهولة أراضيها، ويسر المواصلات إلى عمّان، حيث تشابكت المباني وتوسعت على حساب الأراضي الزراعية الخصبة التي تمتاز بها المحافظة.\n\nالتعليم\nتتواجدُ في مدينة مادبا 47 مدرسة للمراحل الدراسية المختلفة، من أهمها كينغز أكاديمي، إضافةً إلى 20 دار حضانة، كما أنَّها تعتمدُ على المناطق والبلدات المحيطة بها في مراكز تدريبٍ لاختصاصاتٍ أخرى.\n\nكما يوجد في المدينة 13 مركزاً تعليمياً مُرخصاً من الحكومة، وتوفّر هذه المراكز دوراتٍ في مجالات الأعمال، والإدارة، واستخدام الحاسوب. كما تقعُ فيها محطة مادبا المعرفية، المُتخصِّصة بتوفير خدمات التدريب بمجال التقنية.\nلم تكُن تتواجدُ في المدينة - حتى وقتٍ قريب - أيّ جامعةٍ أو كليَّة للتعليم بعد المدرسي، وذلك حتى افتتاح الجامعة الأمريكية في مادبا عام 2011. تعتبر الجامعة الأمريكية في مادبا جامعةً خاصَّة، ولها كليات مُخصَّصة لمجالات الهندسة والصحة والعلوم وتقنية المعلومات والفنون وإدارة الأعمال واللغات.\nيُشار بالذكر إلى أنه قد تم تأسيس الجامعة الألمانية الأردنية عام 2005 في منطقة المشقر المحيطة بمادبا، وتحديدًا على طريق مادبا الغربي، الذي يصل المدينة بكل من العاصمة عمّان وناعور.\n\nالثقافة\nعُرفت مادبا في خمسينيات وستينيات القرن العشرين باسم «موسكو الصغيرة»، لكثرة ما فيها من شيوعيين كانوا جزءاً من حراك سياسي وحزبي، شارك في تشكيله أيضًا، البعثيون والقوميون العرب. وفي مرحلة متأخرة نسبيًا، ظهرت الحركة الإسلامية. كما كان لشخصيات أدبيّة من المدينة الدور الريادي في الحياة الثقافيّة والسياسيّة في المملكة حتى قبل تأسيس إمارة شرق الأردن، حيث أنجبت مدينة مادبا على مر تاريخها المعاصر العديد من الأعلام البارزين في المشهد الثقافي الأردني.\nتضم مادبا وجوارها عدة مراكز ثقافيّة يصل عددها إلى 18 مركزًا وهيئة تتبع لمديرية ثقافة مادبا وتعنى بالشأن الثقافي كمؤسسات مجتمع محلي. كما تضم المدينة عدة متاحف تحكي تاريخها، منها متحف مادبا الأثري ومتحف الحكاية التراثي في جبل نيبو ومنتزه مادبا الأثري، كما رُممت مباني البلدة القديمة فيها بشكل جيد، حيث يتم عقد الفعاليات الثقافية فيها.\nتشهد مادبا ازديادًا بالأنشطة والمهرجانات المحليّة، وذلك منذ إعلانها عاصمة للثقافة الأردنيّة في عام 2012، وهو مشروع تنظمه وزارة الثقافة الأردنيّة بحيث يتم اختيار مدينة كل عام ليتم تركز النشاطات الثقافية فيها. حيث أعلنت الوزراة بهذه المناسبة، عن افتتاح عدد من الصروح الثقافيّة، كما استضافت المدينة على مدار عام العديد من الفعاليات الأدبيّة والفنيّة والندوات والمؤتمرات والعروض والأمسيات الشعرية، بالإضافة إلى إصدار الكتب وإعداد مجموعة من الأفلام الوثائقية التي تبرز تاريخ المدينة وتراثها.\n\nالعمارة\nتُعتبر مادبا من المدن التراثيّة المهمّة في الأردن. كما تُعتبر بلدية مادبا الكبرى من أوائل البلديّات في المملكة التي استحدثت قسمًا للتراث، وعيًا منها لأهميته وحفاظًا على هوية المكان. كما قامت بترميم العديد من المعالم القديمة، حيث قامت بترميم طريق تراثي متكامل تحت اسم مسار مادبا التراثي.\n\nكما يعكس تطور مادبا المعماري والمدني، الظروف التاريخيّة والدينيّة والاجتماعيّة الخاصة بإعادة استيطان المدينة في أواخر القرن التاسع عشر، فكانت عمارة المدينة أساسًا من المحتوى الاجتماعي لمكونيها من العائلات المسيحية التي انتقلت من الكرك إلى مادبا في تلك الفترة، والتي قامت ببناء المباني سواء المدنيّة منها أو التجاريّة والحكوميّة، والتي لا تزال موجودة للآن في منطقة وسط المدينة والتي تشبه لحد كبير تصاميم المباني الموجودة في باقي منطقة بلاد الشام. حيث تضم مدينة مادبا ومحيطها مجموعة كبيرة من البيوت التراثيّة التي تجسد العمارة التقليديّة للمجتمع الأردني (يبلغ عددها 25 بيتًا في المدينة وحدها، تحوّل بعضها إلى متاحف ومطاعم وبازارات واستثمارات أخرى). وتمتاز تلك البيوت ذات أنماط العمارة التقليدية ببساطة البناء المتكيّف مع البيئة والمناخ، حيث شُيدت بمواد بناء متوافرة محليًا، مثل الطين والقش والقصب، وذلك لحماية السكان من برد الشتاء والحيوانات المفترسة. لقد كانت بيوت مادبا القديمة المبنية على طراز القناطر، تضم جزء أساسي في تكوينها، وهو الحوش. وكان من مكونات بعض تلك البيوت الخارجيّة ما يشبه مصطبة مرتفعة كانت بمثابة مكان للسهر صيفًا. كما يوجد في أعلى البوابات فتحات للتهوية وللسماح بدخول أشعة الشمس وتمرير الهواء إلى داخل الدار. كما يتميز البيت المادبي القديم، بتنوع الزخرفة وتصوير المواضيع الزخرفية النباتية والهندسية، وبارتفاع الأسقف الحجريّة.\n\nالنسيج الحضري\nبالنسبة للتخطيط الحضري للمدينة وضواحيها، فقد أخذت مدينة مادبا الشكل الشريطي تماشيًا مع امتداد الطرق الرئيسة، بحيث لم يزد ارتفاع أعلى نقطة للمدينة عن 900 متر عن سطح البحر في منطقة التل. ولم يؤثر الوضع الطبوغرافي لمادبا على شكلها، بل نمت المدينة وتطورت في جميع الاتجاهات دون عوائق، وقد تضاعفت مساحة مادبا عبر تطورها التاريخي لمرات عدة، منذ بداية القرن العشرين في كافة الاتجاهات. ويعمل الزحف العمراني على تقليص المساحات الزراعيّة المتبقية في مادبا وجوارها، حيث تشهد المدينة نهضة عمرانيّة كبيرة بسبب قربها من العاصمة عمّان وسهولة أراضيها، ويسر المواصلات إلى الأخيرة، حيث تشابكت المباني وتوسّعت على حساب الأراضي الزراعيّة الخصبة التي تمتاز بها.\n\nأبرز معالم المدينة\nالرياضة\nتُعتبر المدينة الرياضية في مادبا، والواقعة في منطقة الهلاليّة جنوب مركز المدينة بحوالي 7 كيلومترات، نقطة جذب رياضي في المحافظة رغم تواضعها، حيث تستقبل المباريات الرسميّة التي تقيمها الاتحادات الرياضيّة المختلفة أو من خلال التدريبات المستمرة للأندية والهيئات الشبابيّة ومؤسسات المجتمع المدني في المحافظة منذ عام 1997. تضم المدينة الرياضيّة عدة منشآت رياضيّة، أهمها الصالة المتعددة الأغراض التي تتسع لحوالي 1,500 متفرج، والملعب الأولمبي لكرة القدم الذي يتسع لحوالي 2,000 متفرج، والملاعب المكشوفة المُخصصة لكرة اليد وكرة القدم الخماسي والكرة الطائرة وكرة السلة، وتتسع مدرجاتها لحوالي 1,000 متفرج، بالإضافة إلى المسابح وملاعب السكواش وملاعب الأطفال، وبيت الشباب.\nيُشار بالذكر إلى أن المدينة وجوارها تضم عدة أندية رياضيّة تشارك في دوري محافظة مادبا، منها نادي اتحاد مادبا، نادي الوحدة الأردني، نادي مليح، ونادي حسبان. وتُصنف جميعها ضمن دوري الدرجة الثانية الأردني فما دون.\n\nتوأمة المدن\nفلسطين، بيت لحم \n فلسطين، العبيدية \n بلغاريا، تونجا \n الولايات المتحدة، دينتون، تكساس\n\nانظر أيضًا\nمعرض

La route romaine et les vestiges de l’architecture urbaine sont toujours présents dans le centre de la ville moderne. \nMadaba est réputée pour ses mosaïques byzantines et omeyyades. La plupart des mosaïques se trouvent au nord de la ville. Pendant l’époque byzantine – omeyyade, dans la partie nord – traversée par une route romaine bordée de colonnes – furent construits l’église de la Carte de la Palestine, la salle Hippolyte, l’église de la Vierge, l’église du prophète Elie avec une crypte, l’église des Saints-Martyrs (Al-Khadir), le Palais Brûlé et l’église de la famille Szunna.

          "content": "## Overview\nMadaba is a small town in central Jordan located south of the capital Amman on the King's Highway, some 10 km from Hesban.\n\n## Understand\nA town with a long history, Madaba is best known as the location of the \"Madaba Map\", a 6th-century mosaic depiction of Jerusalem and many parts of the Holy Land.\nIn biblical times the city was part of the Moab Kingdom. After having been conquered by the Persians and after a devastating earthquake in 746 A.D., the city was left alone and remained mostly abandoned until 1890, when the reconstruction of a Greek Orthodox church revealed the famous mosaic.\nMadaba with about 80,000 inhabitants is approximately 10% Christian (Catholics & Greek Orthodox). Much of the traveller and pilgrim infrastructure is run by the Franciscans. For the Bedouins living around the area, Madaba is an important market place.\n\n## Get in\nThe city is 25 km from Queen Alia International Airport and 35-40 km from the Dead Sea, potentially making it the ideal place to start or end your trip to Jordan.\n\n## By bus\n31.71510135.7988241 Madaba Bus Station (in the east of town, next to the highway).    (updated Oct 2018)\nMadaba is about 1 hr from Amman. Buses from Amman's Tabarbour Station cost 1.20 JD (Oct 2018). Also, there are frequent minibuses from the 7th circle in Amman (1 JD)—they come from the center direction and take a turn south onto the airport road, directly after which you will find the bus stop.\nYou can also get buses from the Mahatta bus station, and minibuses from the Muhajireen bus station near the Jordan Museum (0.65 JD) which enter Madaba from the west rather than from Airport Rd.\n\n## By taxi\nA taxi is a good option, especially if you're in a group. The cost depends on your bargaining abilities but it can go from 8-12 JD. Or you go by meter, which is about 12 JD. from northern Amman.  Service taxis leave from Airport Rd near 7th Circle and cost 2 JD per person.\nBecause Madaba is close to Amman, Uber is available throughout town, including at Mount Nebo. The Uber price from the airport to Madaba city centre was around 6 JD as of Feb 2019.\n\n## By car\nThe very centre of town has narrow, crowded streets, but just a few hundred metres away, you can find wide roads with plenty of parking.\n\n## Get around\nMadaba is a very small city, so one can easily get around by on foot, although a taxi from downtown to the bus station is a good idea (1-2 JD). Taxis traveling within the city do not use the taxi meter but operate at a standard fare of 1 JD per trip. Make sure you agree on this price with the driver before hopping on. Uber is also available inside the city. Very good option for a ride to Mt. Nebo (around 5 JD from Madaba center) (Feb 2019).\n\n## See\n31.71658735.7961011 Madaba Visitor Centre, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq. 07:00-00:00. Local information and free, clean toilets.

          "content": "Mount Nebo (Arabic: جَبَل نِيبُو, romanized: Jabal Nībū; Hebrew: הַר נְבוֹ‎, romanized: Har Nəḇō) is an elevated ridge located in Jordan, approximately 700 metres (2,300 ft) above sea level. Part of the Abarim mountain range, Mount Nebo is mentioned in the Bible as the place where Moses was granted a view of the Promised Land before his death. The view from the summit provides a panorama of the West Bank across the Jordan River valley. The city of Jericho is usually visible from the summit, as is Jerusalem on a very clear day. The biblical town of Nebo, now known as Khirbet al-Mukhayyat, is located 3.5 km (2.1 mi) away.\n\nReligious significance\nAccording to the Bible (Deuteronomy), Moses ascended Mount Nebo, in the land of Moab (today in Jordan), and from there he saw the Land of Canaan (the Promised Land), which God had said he would not enter; Moses then died there. The Bible (Deuteronomy 34:6) says Moses' burial place was unknown. A monument atop Mount Nebo commemorates Moses' death after seeing Canaan, across the Jordan valley. A purported grave of Moses is located at Maqam El-Nabi Musa, in the West Bank, 11 km (6.8 mi) south of Jericho and 20 km (12 mi) east of Jerusalem.\nMount Nebo is then mentioned again in 2 Maccabees (2:4–7), when the prophet Jeremiah hid the tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant in a cave there.\nA Christian church from Byzantine times stands on the top of Mount Nebo.\nOn March 20, 2000, Pope John Paul II visited the summit of Mount Nebo during his pilgrimage to the Holy Land. During his visit, he planted an olive tree next to the Byzantine chapel, as a symbol of peace. Pope Benedict XVI visited the site in 2009, gave a speech, and looked out from the top of the mountain in the direction of Jerusalem.\nA serpentine cross sculpture atop Mount Nebo was created by Italian artist Gian Paolo Fantoni. It is symbolic of the miracle of the bronze serpent invoked by Moses in the wilderness (Numbers 21:4–9) and the cross upon which Jesus was crucified (John 3:14).\n\nArchaeology\nSystematic exploration begun by Sylvester J. Saller O.F.M. was continued in 1933 by Jerome Mihaic of the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum. On the highest point of the mountain, Syagha, the remains of a Byzantine church and monastery were discovered in 1933. The church was first constructed in the second half of the 4th century to commemorate the place of Moses' death. The church design follows a typical basilica pattern. It was enlarged in the late fifth century AD and rebuilt in AD 597. The church is first mentioned in an account of a pilgrimage made by a lady Aetheria in AD 394. Six tombs have been found hollowed from the natural rock beneath the mosaic-covered floor of the church.\nBellarmino Bagatti worked on the site in 1935. Virgilio Canio Corbo later excavated the interior of the basilica.\n\nHistory of the modern Memorial of Moses\nThe ancient church, a pilgrimage destination since the 4th century, was excavated between 1933 and 1938 by Sylvester Saller, bringing to light the basilica with its chapels and the annexes of the monastery. The exquisite mosaics were then covered back with soil for protection. In 1963, the Custody of the Holy Land decided to restore the mosaic floors and Virgilio Corbo was put in charge of the project. A metal shelter designed in Oxford was erected over the ruins, but work was interrupted by the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Renewed work ensued between 1976-1984, when a new mosaic was discovered in the diaconicon-baptistery. By 1984 the consolidation work was completed, and as a result, the basilica could be used both for liturgical purposes, as well as for displaying the restored mosaics, either in situ or mounted on the walls. After renewed plans drawn in 1989 and geological surveys and assessments of the ancient and modern structures made a decade later, a new shelter, basically a complete basilica was built over the ancient church between December 2007 and the reopening day on 15 October 2016. Not even the sudden death of Michelle Piccirillo, a key figure in the project, in October 2008, led to a break in the work.\n\nExhibited mosaics\nIn the modern chapel presbytery, built to protect the site and provide worship space, remnants of mosaic floors from different periods can be seen. The earliest of these is a panel with a braided cross presently placed on the east end of the south wall.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nEarly Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East\nMount Nebo, Utah\nMount Pisgah (Bible)\nNabau\nNabi Musa\nMichele Piccirillo (archaeologist) (1944–2008), active at Mount Nebo and buried there\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nMount Nebo: New Archaeological Excavations: 1967–1997, Michele Piccirillo and Eugenio Alliata\n\nExternal links\n\nFranciscans at Mount Nebo\nArchaeology and Art – photographs of excavations in Jordan\nPictures from Mount Nebo 1\n\"Nebo, Mount\" .

          "content": "Al-Maghtas (Arabic: المغطس, romanized: al-Maghṭas, lit. 'the Baptism' or 'the Immersion'), officially known as Baptism Site \"Bethany Beyond the Jordan\", is an archaeological World Heritage Site in Jordan, on the east bank of the Jordan River, reputed to be the location of the Baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist and venerated as such since at least the Byzantine period. The place has also been referred to as Bethabara (Hebrew: בית עברה) and historically Bethany (בית עניה) or Bethany Beyond the Jordan (see below).\nAl-Maghtas includes two principal archaeological areas: the remnants of a monastery on a mound known as Jabal Mar-Elias (جبل مار إلياس, 'Elijah's Hill') and an area close to the river with remains of churches, baptism ponds and pilgrim and hermit dwellings. The two areas are connected by a stream called Wadi Kharrar (وادي خرار).\nThe strategic location between Jerusalem and the King's Highway is already evident from the Book of Joshua report about the Israelites crossing the Jordan there. Jabal Mar-Elias is traditionally identified as the site of the ascension of the prophet Elijah to heaven. The complete area was abandoned after the 1967 Six-Day War, when both banks of the Jordan became part of the frontline. The area was heavily mined then.\nAfter the signing of the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994, de-mining of the area soon took place at the initiative of Jordanian Prince Ghazi. The site has since then seen several archaeological digs, visits by three Popes (John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis) and by many heads of state, and attracts tourists and pilgrimage activity. In 2015, the site was designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, excluding the western side of the river. Approximately 81,000 people visited the site in 2016, mostly European, American, and Arab tourists. Thousands flock to the site on January 6 to mark Epiphany.\n\nNames\nBethany\nTwo passages from the Gospel of John indicate a place \"beyond the Jordan\" or \"across the Jordan\": \n\nJohn 1:28: These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptising. This is the only mention of this \"Bethany on the East bank of the Jordan\" in the New Testament.\nJohn 10:40: He [Jesus] went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing earlier, and he remained there.\n\"Bethany\" may come from bēṯ ‛ăniyāh (בית עניה), Hebrew for 'house of the poor/afflicted'. The name \"Bethany\" is shared with a different town located on the Mount of Olives, mentioned many times in the New Testament. Most English versions of the New Testament refer to \"Bethany on the east bank of the Jordan River\" (including the Douay-Rheims, NIV, NASB, NLT, RSV, IBS, and Darby).\n\nBethabara\nOrigen was a 3rd-century Christian scholar from the Roman Empire. Noticing that in his time there was no place called Bethany east of the Jordan, he suggested amending the name to Bethabara, an existing place at the time. His suggestion was picked up by some, and it was used in several translations, including the King James Version.\n\"Bethabara\" ( beth-AB-ər-ə; Hebrew: בית עברה, romanized: Bēṯ ‛Ăbārāh; Ancient Greek: Βηθαβαρά, romanized: Bēthabará; lit. 'House of the Ford'  or 'Place of Crossing') is the name used by some versions of the New Testament for the site \"beyond (i.e. east of) the Jordan\" where John the Baptist preached and performed baptisms, where he met with a group of priests and Levites sent by the Pharisees to investigate his ministry, and where he baptised Jesus (Yeshua) (John 1:28–29). The name \"Bethabara\" also appears on the 6th-century Madaba Map (though west of the Jordan River) and in the Talmud. The name is used in a number of versions, including the King James Version (following the Textus Receptus and in the Geneva Bible of the New Testament) the place where John the Baptist was baptizing in John 1:28 was not called Bethany, but Bethabara.\nIt follows the New York and Moscow uncials, corrected forms of Ephraemi and Athos, along with uncial fragments from St Petersburg, Paris, minuscule 1, and family 13, backed up by Eusebius, Cyril, some Byzantine texts and lectionaries, and the Curetonian Old Syriac, Aramaic Peshitta, Armenian, and Georgian manuscripts, among others, \". The reading Bethabara became current owing to the advocacy of both Origen (3rd century) and John Chrysostom (4th century), and that same Bethabara is attested in both the 6th-century Madaba Map and in the Jewish Talmud.\nG. A. Smith suggests in his \"Atlas of the Historical Geography of the Holy Land\" (HGHL; 1915) that Bethany ('House of the Ship') and Bethabara ('House of the Ford') are names for the same place. The second place may also refer to the more northerly territory of Batanaea.\n\nAl-Maghtas\nAl-Maghtas is the Arabic word for a site of immersion, and implicitly of baptism.\n\nGeography\nAl-Maghtas is located on the eastern bank of the Jordan River, 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) north of the Dead Sea and 10 km (6.2 mi) southeast of Jericho. The entire site, which is spread over an area of 533.7 hectares (5.337 km2; 1,319 acres), has two distinct zones – Tell al-Kharrar, also called Jabal Mar Elias (Elijah's Hill), and the area close to the river (2 km (1.2 mi) to the west), the Zor area, where the ancient Church of Saint John the Baptist is situated.\nThe site is close to the ancient road between Jerusalem and Transjordan, via Jericho, across a Jordan River ford and connecting to other biblical sites such as Madaba, Mount Nebo and the King's Highway.\nWhile the initial site of veneration was on the eastern side of the River Jordan, the focus had shifted to the western side by the 6th century. The term Al-Maghtas itself has been used historically for the area stretching over both banks of the river. The western part, also known under the name Qasr el-Yahud, has been mentioned in the UNESCO proposal, but so far has not been declared as a World Heritage Site.\nIn November 2015, the site became available on Google Street View.\n\nReligious significance\nIsraelites' crossing of the Jordan\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, Joshua instructed the Israelites how to cross the Jordan by following the priests who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant through the river, thus making its waters stop their flow (Joshua 3, mainly Joshua 3:14–17). Ancient traditions identified Al-Maghtas, known in antiquity as bet-'abarah or Bethabara, \"House of the Crossing\" (see Madaba Map), as the place where the people of Israel and later Prophet Elijah crossed the Jordan River and entered the Promised Land.\n\nProphet Elijah\nThe Hebrew Bible also described how Prophet Elijah, accompanied by Prophet Elisha, stopped the waters of the Jordan, crossing to the eastern side, and then went up by a whirlwind into the heavens. Elisha, now his heir, again separated the waters and crossed back (2 Kings 2:8–14). An ancient Jewish tradition identified the site of crossing with the same one used by Joshua, thus with Al-Maghtas, and the site of Elijah's ascension with Tell el-Kharrar, also known as Jabal Mar Elias, \"Hill of Prophet Elijah\".\n\nBaptism of Jesus\nJohn probably baptised in springs and brooks at least as much as he did in the more dangerous Jordan River. The concrete example is \"Aenon near Salim\" of John 3:23, where \"aenon\" stands for spring. At Al-Maghtas there is a short brook, Wadi al-Kharrar, which flows to the Jordan, and is associated with the baptism activities of John.\n\nHistoricity\nThe Washington Post states, \"There is no archaeological evidence of Jesus ever having been baptized in these waters\"; however, the Jordanian, eastern side of the traditional baptism area of Al-Maghtas has been accepted by various Christian denominations as the authentic site of the baptism of Jesus. ICOMOS in its consideration of \"Bethany Beyond the Jordan\" as a UNESCO World Heritage Site notes that sites historically associated with Jesus' baptism also exist on the west bank across the river as well and puts forth that their investigation into the Al-Maghtas site for recognition as a World Heritage Center does not prove without doubt that the archaeological structures there actually relate historically to Jesus' baptism and further notes that other sites along the Jordan River have historically made similar claims. The Baptism Site's official website shows 13 authentication testimonials from representatives of major international denominations.\n\nHistory and archaeology\nPre-Roman settlement\nThe archaeological excavations have unearthed antiquities which attest to the conclusion that this site was first settled by a small group of agriculturists during the Chalcolithic period, around 3500 BC. There are again signs of settlement from the Hellenistic period.\n\nRoman and Byzantine periods\nThe site contains buildings with both aspects of a Jewish mikveh (ritual bath) resembling Second Temple period pools from Qumran, and later of Christian use, with large pools for baptism, linking both customs.\nPossibly in the 2nd–3rd and certainly starting with the 5th–6th centuries, Christian religious structures were built at Tell al-Kharrar. It must be remembered that in the 1st-4th centuries of the Christian Era, Christianity was often persecuted by the Roman state, and only after it became first tolerated and then outright the state religion of the Roman, or now so-called Byzantine Empire, open Christian worship became possible.\nArchaeological excavations also established that the hill of Tell al-Kharrar, known as Elijah's Hill, was venerated as the spot from which Prophet Elijah ascended to heaven. In the 5th century, in commemoration, a Byzantine monastery was erected here. The archaeologists have named it the \"Monastery of Rhetorios\" after a name from a Byzantine mosaic inscription.\nThe Byzantine emperor Anastasius I Dicorus erected between 491 and 518 a first church dedicated to John the Baptist on the eastern banks of the River Jordan. However, due to two flood and earthquake events the church was destroyed. The church was reconstructed three times, until it crumbled, together with the chapel built over piers, during a major flood event in the 6th or 7th century.\nThe pilgrimage sites have shifted throughout history. The main Christian archaeological finds from the Byzantine and possibly even Roman period indicated that the initial venerated pilgrimage site was on the east bank, but by the beginning of the 6th century the focus had moved onto the more accessible west bank of the river.\nDuring the Byzantine period, the site was a popular pilgrimage centre. The Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem in 614, river floodings, earthquakes and the Muslim capture of Jerusalem in 637 put an end to Byzantine building activity on the east bank of the Jordan, particularly in the Wadi al-Kharrar area.\n\nEarly Muslim period\nThe Muslim conquest put an end to Byzantine building activity on the east bank of the Jordan River, but several of the Byzantine structures remained in use during the Early Islamic period. With time worship took place just across the river on the western side at Qasr el-Yahud. After 670 AD the commemoration of the baptism site moved to the western side.\n\nMamluk and Ottoman periods\nThe structures were rebuilt many times but were finally deserted by end of the 15th century.\nIn the 13th century an Orthodox monastery was built over remnants of an earlier Byzantine predecessor, but how long it lasted is not known. However, pilgrimage to the site declined and according to one pilgrim, the site was in ruins in 1484. From the 15th to the 19th century there were hardly any visits by pilgrims to the site. A small chapel dedicated to St. Mary of Egypt, a hermit from the Byzantine period, was built during the 19th century and was also destroyed in the 1927 earthquake.\nIn the early part of the twentieth century, a farming community had occupied the area east of the Jordan River.\n\nRediscovery after 1994 and tourism\nAs a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the river became the ceasefire line and both banks became militarised and inaccessible to pilgrims. After 1982, while Qasr el-Yahud was still off-limits, Israel enabled Christian baptisms at the Yardenit site further north. Following the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994 access to Al-Maghtas was restored after Prince Ghazi of Jordan, who is deeply interested in religious history, visited the area in the company of a Franciscan archaeologist who had convinced him to take a look at what was thought to be the baptism site. When they found evidence of Roman-period habitation, this was enough to encourage de-mining and further development. Soon afterwards, there were several archaeological digs led by Dr. Mohammad Waheeb who rediscovered the ancient site in 1997. The 1990s marked the period of archaeological excavations of the site followed by primary conservation and restoration measures during the early 21st century. Jordan fully reopened al-Maghtas in 2002. This was then followed by the Israeli-run western side, known as Qasr el-Yahud, which was opened for daily visits in 2011 – the traditional Epiphany celebrations had already been allowed to take place since 1985, but only at the specific Catholic and Orthodox dates and under military supervision. In 2007, a documentary film entitled The Baptism of Jesus Christ – Uncovering Bethany Beyond the Jordan was made about the site.\nThe western side attracts larger tourist interest than its Jordanian counterpart, with half a million visitors compared to some ten thousand on the Jordanian side. Other estimates put the numbers as 300,000 on the Israeli side and 100,000 on the Jordanian side. To put that into perspective, Yardenit has more than 400,000 visitors per year.\nIn the millennium year 2000, John Paul II was the first pope to visit the site. His two successors, popes Benedict XVI and Pope Francis, also visited the site, as have a number of heads of state and other dignitaries. In 2002, Christians commemorated the baptism of Christ at the site for the first time since its rediscovery. Since then, thousands of Christian pilgrims from around the world annually have marked Epiphany at Bethany Beyond the Jordan. Also in 2002, the Baptism Site opened for daily visits, attracting a constant influx of tourists and pilgrimage activity. In 2015, the UNESCO declared the Al-Maghtas site in Jordan, on the east bank of the River Jordan, as a World Heritage Site, while Qasr el-Yahud was left out.\nThe Museum of Jesus' Baptism is planned to be built at Al-Maghtas by 2030 as part of the Jordanian governments attempt to attract 1 million Christian tourists to the area.\n\nFeatures\nArchaeological excavations at the site of the 1990s have revealed religious edifices of the Roman and Byzantine periods which include \"churches and chapels, a monastery, caves used by hermits and pools\", which were venues of baptisms. The excavations have been supported by institutions from various countries, such as the US and Finland, and by the German Protestant Institute.\n\nTell el-Kharrar or Elijah's Hill and the baptismal pools\nThe digs unearthed three churches, three baptismal pools, a circular well and an external compound encircling the hill. The existence of water supply sourced from springs and conveyed to the baptism sites through ceramic pipes was revealed; this facility is available even now.\n\nBankside area (Zor)\nIn the Zor area of the site, the finds uncovered a church with a hall with columns, a basilica church known as the Church of St. John the Baptist, and the Lower Basilica Church with marble floors having geometrical designs. Also exposed were the Upper Basilica Church, the marble steps, the four piers of the Chapel of the Mantle, the Small Chapel, the Laura of St. Mary of Egypt, and a large pool. The stairway of marble steps was built in 570 AD. Twenty-two of the steps are made of black marble. The stairway leads to the Upper Basilica and a baptismal pool. This pool had once four piers that supported the Chapel of the Mantle.\n\nHermitages\nThe Quattara hills revealed a number of monk caves, also known as hermit cells, which are 300 metres (980 ft) away from the Jordan River. When the caves were in use access was through a rope way or by stairway or ladders from the western and south-western sides, but none of these are seen now. Each of these caves was carved with a semicircular niche on its eastern wall. Each cave has two chambers, one for prayer and another a living space for the monks.\n\nTombs\nTombs unearthed in and outside the churches are believed to be of monks of the churches. These tombs are of the Byzantine and early Islamic periods (5th–7th centuries). Numismatics finds of coins and ceramics at the site are epigraphic proofs of the site's history.\n\nUNESCO involvement\nIn 1994, UNESCO sponsored archaeological excavations in the area. Initially UNESCO had listed the site in the tentative list on 18 June 2001 and a new nomination was presented on 27 January 2014. ICOMOS evaluated the report presented by Jordan from 21 to 25 September 2014. The finds are closely associated with the commemoration of the baptism. Following this evaluation, the site was inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site under the title \"Bethany Beyond the Jordan (Al-Maghtas)\". It was inscribed as a cultural property under UNESCO Criteria (iii) and (vi). The Palestinian Tourist agency deplores the UNESCO's decision to leave out the western baptismal site. During the negotiations of the UNESCO listings, the original proposal to UNESCO stated the will to expand the site in the future in cooperation with \"the neighboring country\".\n\nSite management\nThe Baptism Site is operated by the Baptism Site Commission, an independent board of trustees appointed by King Abdullah II. In 2017, the Commission reported that approximately 81,000 people visited the site in 2016, a 23% increase from 2015, by mostly European, American, and Arab tourists.\n\nSee also\nÆnon, a baptism site mentioned in the Gospel of John\nBaptism of Jesus\nChronology of Jesus\nList of Christian pilgrimage sites\nList of World Heritage Sites in Jordan\nMandaeism\nMasbuta\nMinistry of Jesus\nNew Testament places associated with Jesus\nQasr al-Yahud, the West Bank side of al-Maghtas\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nDocumentary\nUNESCO report\nThe baptism site of Jesus in Jordan.

          "content": "Wadi Rum (Arabic: وادي رم Wādī Ramm, also Wādī al-Ramm, known also as the Valley of the Moon or Red mountains (Arabic: وادي القمر, romanized: Wādī al-Qamar), is a valley cut into the sandstone and granite rock in southern Jordan, near the border with Saudi Arabia and about 60 km (37 mi) to the east of the city of Aqaba. With an area of 720 km2 (280 sq mi) it is the largest wadi (river valley) in Jordan.\nSeveral prehistoric civilizations left petroglyphs, rock inscriptions and ruins in Wadi Rum. Today it is a tourist attraction, offering guided tours, hiking and rock climbing. The Wadi Rum Protected Area has been a UNESCO World Heritage site since 2011.\n\nToponym\nWadi Rum or Wadi Ramm is believed to get its name from the early name of Iram of the Pillars (also called Irum (Arabic: إرم)), a lost city mentioned in the Quran.\n\nGeography\nThe area is centered on the main valley of Wadi Rum. The highest elevation in Jordan is Jabal Umm ad Dami at 1,840 m (6,040 ft) high (SRTM data states 1854 m), located 30 kilometers south of Wadi Rum village. It was first located  by Difallah Ateeg, a Zalabia Bedouin from Rum. On a clear day, it is possible to see the Red Sea and the Saudi border from the top.\nJabal Ram or Jebel Rum (1,734 metres (5,689 ft) above sea level) is the second highest peak in Jordan and the highest peak in the central Rum, rising directly above Rum valley, opposite Jebel um Ishrin, which is possibly one meter lower.\nKhaz'ali Canyon in Wadi Rum is the site of petroglyphs etched into the cave walls depicting humans and antelopes dating back to the Thamudic times. The village of Wadi Rum itself consists of several hundred Bedouin inhabitants with their goat-hair tents and concrete houses and also their four-wheel vehicles, one school for boys and one for girls, a few shops, and the headquarters of the Desert Patrol.\n\nClimate\nWadi Rum experiences a desert climate (Köppen: BWh/BWk). Rainfall is scarce, often occurring as flash floods, and results almost exclusively from thunderstorms. These thunderstorms are caused when cold upper air pools passing through the Eastern Mediterranean interact with the Red Sea thermal low, combined with the presence of subtropical moisture in the mid and high levels of the atmosphere.\n\nGeology\nWadi Rum is located within the Sandstone Mountain and Valley Region of southern Jordan the area is characterized by tall, near vertical mountains of iron-rich, erosion resistant, Umm Ishrin Sandstone, separated by flat-bottom valleys of alluvial sediments, aeolian sands, and salt pans.  The Umm Ishrin is the thickest formation in the Lower Palaeozoic-Upper Cretaceous Nubian Sandstone, underlying the Disi and Umm Sahn sandstone formations, and overlying the Salib Arkosic Formation. The Salib in turn overlies the eroded Aqaba Complex of plutonic granitoids. An aquifer forms along this lithologic contact, with springs forming on the eastern mountain slopes.  Alluvial fans compose most of the alluvial sediments. Aeolian systems include tafoni, natural bridges, and sand dunes. Sand dunes include barkhans, climbing dunes consisting of sand ramps that reach the tops of hills, and echo dunes consisting of sands that have crawled over a hill to be deposited on the lee side.\n\nHistory\nVarious human cultures have inhabited Wadi Rum since prehistoric times, with many cultures–including the Nabataeans–leaving their mark in the form of petroglyphs, inscriptions, and temple ruins.\nAccording to Bienkowski, the area was part of the Kingdom of Edom (between the 13th and 6th centuries BCE). The region contains numerous archaeological remains, including copper mining sites at Wadi Feynan and ancient fortifications. Trade routes connecting Arabia to the Levant passed through the area, contributing to its prosperity.\nCurrently, the majority is made up by the Zalabieh Bedouins who arrived to the region around 1980. The word \"Bedouin\" comes from the Arabic word for desert, pronounced badiya in the Arabic language. The root of this word is bad’a, which translates to \"clear\" and \"obvious\" in Arabic. One central characteristic for Bedouin tribes is the sense of belonging that tribe members feel.\nWhen they first arrived, the Zalabieh bedouins lived in tents. Their village held about 700-800 people. 80% of those people were either retired from the army or the police.\nThe camel is the favorite animal of the Zalabieh bedouins. It is a symbol for male pride. Camel racing is an important sport for the Bedouins.  These races allow Bedouins to engage in male competition, and establish manhood and power within the community.\nWadi Rum was documented by British officer T. E. Lawrence, who passed through several times during the Arab Revolt of 1917–18.  In the 1980s one of the rock formations in Wadi Rum, originally known as \"Jabal al-Mazmar\" (The Mountain of (the) Plague), was named \"The Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\" after Lawrence's book penned in the aftermath of the war, though the 'Seven Pillars' referred to in the book have no connection with Rum.\nLawrence described his entrance into the Valley of Rumm: \"The hills on the right grew taller and sharper, a fair counterpart of the other side which straightened itself to one massive rampart of redness. They drew together until only two miles divided them: and then, towering gradually till their parallel parapets must have been a thousand feet above us, ran forward in an avenue for miles. The crags were capped in nests of domes, less hotly red than the body of the hill; rather grey and shallow. They gave the finishing semblance of Byzantine architecture to this irresistible place: this processional way greater than imagination.\"\nLawrence also described his encounter with the spring, Ain Shalaaleh, \"On the rock-bulge above were clear-cut Nabathaean inscriptions, and a sunk panel incised with a monogram or symbol. Around and about were Arab scratches, including tribe-marks, some of which were witnesses of forgotten migrations: but my attention was only for the splashing of water in a crevice under the shadow of the overhanging rock. I looked in to see the spout, a little thinner than my wrist, jetting out firmly from a fissure in the roof, and falling with that clean sound into a shallow, frothing pool, behind the step which served as an entrance.  Thick ferns and grasses of the finest green made it a paradise just five feet square.\"\nThe discovery of the Nabataean Temple (located walking distance from the Rest House) in 1933 briefly returned the spotlight to the desert. A French team of archaeologists completed the excavations in 1997.\n\nActivities\nTourism\nDesert scenes of Wadi Rum in Lawrence of Arabia from 1962 kick-started Jordan's tourism industry.\nWadi Rum is one of Jordan's most popular tourist sites, attracting 162,000 tourists in 2017. Wadi Rum is home to the Zalabieh tribe, who developed eco-adventure tourism and services throughout the protected area. Using local guides and services brings many benefits to the protected area. In particular, it enables people to continue earning a living from the land and helps to ensure that the protected area remains protected.\nBedouins in Wadi Rum allow tourists to stay overnight in their traditional camps, and provide activities, meals and transport throughout the desert. They also run restaurants and small shops in the villages that provide meals and basic supplies for visitors. Popular activities in Wadi Rum include 4x4 tours, camel rides, hiking, and camping.\nDima and Lama Hattab coordinate an annual marathon in the region called Jabal Ishrin.\n\nRock climbing\nLocal Bedouin have climbed in the sandstone mountains of Wadi Rum for many generations. Many of their 'Bedouin Roads' have been rediscovered and documented by modern climbers. Several are included in the climbing guidebook by Tony Howard, and online by Liên and Gilles Rappeneau.\nIn 1949, Sheikh Hamdan took surveyors to the summit of Jabal Ram.  The first recorded European ascent of Jabal Rum took place in November 1952, by Charmian Longstaff and Sylvia Branford, guided by Sheik Hamdan.  The first recorded rock climbs started in 1984, with the first of many visits by English climbers Howard, Baker, Taylor and Shaw. This group repeated many of the Bedouin routes, accompanied by locals and independently, including, in 1984, Hammad's Route on Jebel Rum, and, in 1985, Sheikh Kraim's Hunter's Slabs and Rijm Assaf on Jebel Rum. Many new routes were climbed in the 1980s, by this team, French guide Wilfried Colonna, by the Swiss Remy brothers, and by Haupolter and Precht.  The first dedicated climbing guide book, Treks and Climb in Wadi Rum, by Tony Howard, was first published in 1987.  Some of the many Bedouin routes have been documented online by Lien and Gilles Rappeneau. A new routes book for climbers is held at the Wadi Rum Guest House.\nThe route Guerre Sainte was climbed in 2000 by Batoux, Petit and friends.  This was the first route in Wadi Rum to be entirely equipped using bolt protection.  The route, on the East Face of Jebel Nassarani North, is 450 m (1,480 ft) long, and graded F7b or F7aA0.\n\nFilming location\nThe area has been used as a background setting in a number of films. Filmmakers are particularly drawn to it for science fiction films set on Mars.\nThe Location Managers Guild recognized the Jordanian Royal Film Commission with its LMGI Award for Outstanding Film Commission in 2017 for its work on Rogue One, which was filmed at Wadi Rum. The RFC was previously nominated for its work with The Martian.\n\nLawrence of Arabia – David Lean filmed much of this 1962 film on location in Wadi Rum.\nPrometheus – scenes for the Alien Planet\nThe Last Days on Mars – filmed for exterior shots representing the surface of the titular planet for this 2013 film.\nThe Martian – filming for the Ridley Scott film began in March 2015, for shots that stood in for the surface of Mars.\nTheeb – Filmed mostly in Wadi Rum, as well as Wadi Araba.\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story, used for scenes set on Jedha.\nAladdin, 2019 live action remake of the 1992 Disney animated film of the same name.\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, used for the desert planet Pasaana.\nDune (2021), used as a location for the desert planet Arrakis. Timothée Chalamet called Wadi Rum 'awe-inspiring'.\nDune: Part Two, used as a filming location.\nAadujeevitham – The desert scenes of the 2024 Malayalam film were mostly shot on locations in Wadi Rum.\nMoon Knight (2022), used for the scenes outside Ammit's tomb.\nThe Amazing Race 34\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4 (2023), used for a desert scene while John Wick is on the move.\nSpecial Forces: World's Toughest Test season 1\nBade Miyan Chote Miyan (2024)\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of World Heritage Sites in Jordan\nNature reserves in Jordan\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nPhotos of Wadi Rum, The American Center of Research\nPhotos of Wadi Rum from the Manar al-Athar photo archive",

Il a été inscrit au Patrimoine mondial en 2011 en tant que bien mixte naturel et culturel. Le site est aussi appelé Iram dans les textes nabatéens.\n\nGéographie\nSur le plan géologique, le Wadi Rum est une vallée (un wadi ou oued) creusée par l'érosion d'un cours d'eau endoréique dans les rochers de grès et de granit du sud-ouest de la Jordanie.\n\nHistoire\nLa présence de dessins, d'inscriptions gravées et de vestiges archéologiques témoigne de 120 siècles d'occupation humaine. Plus de 25 000 pétroglyphes et de 20 000 inscriptions permettent de retracer les débuts de l'écriture alphabétique et l'évolution de la pensée de l'homme, de ses activités pastorales, agricoles et urbaines dans la région. L'armée arabe de Lawrence d'Arabie y passa à l'été 1917 avant de lancer son attaque sur Aqaba.\n\nFaune et flore\nLe Wadi Rum abrite une faune et une flore rare et endémique. De petites populations de bouquetins de Nubie, de loups gris, de renards de Blanford, de renards roux y résident ainsi que le rare chat des sables. Les petits mammifères, les insectes et les reptiles sont plus communs. De nombreux oiseaux de proie sont présents durant les périodes de migration. L'oryx d'Arabie, une antilope du désert, fait l'objet d'un programme de réintroduction depuis 2002. D'anciennes peintures rupestres attestent de sa présence par le passé dans le Wadi Rum. Sa chasse excessive a conduit à sa disparition à l'état sauvage en 1972. Il y a aussi des espèces rares de petites plantes et d'herbes. Les anémones rouges, fleur nationale de Jordanie, y poussent en abondance au bord des routes ainsi que des plantes utilisées depuis des siècles par les populations nomades pour leurs propriétés médicinales.\n\nTourisme\nLa région est l'une des plus importantes destinations touristiques en Jordanie. Elle attire un nombre croissant de touristes, en particulier des grimpeurs et des trekkeurs, mais aussi des amateurs de randonnée équestre, à dos de dromadaire ou en véhicule tout-terrain. \nCet afflux de touristes dans cette région isolée a augmenté sensiblement les revenus de la population bédouine locale qui a pu ainsi diversifier ses activités traditionnelles en développant des entreprises liées au tourisme.\nQuelques sites touristiques du Wadi Rum :\n\nle temple nabatéen\nla source de Lawrence\nKhazali Canyon\nles dunes\nBurdah Rock Bridge\nUm Frouth Rock Bridge\nBurrah Canyon\nSunset Sites\ninscriptions Thamud et nabatéennes\nLes Sept Piliers de la sagesse\n\nEscalade\nLes montagnes de grès du Wadi Rum ont été fréquentées dès la préhistoire et certains sommets faciles certainement gravis par les habitants de la région. Les traces de nombreuses « routes bédouines » ont été redécouvertes et documentées par les grimpeurs modernes, à l'exemple de la traversée du Jebel Rum, la Hammad’s Route ou la Sabba’s Route. Ces itinéraires escarpés (jusqu'au 4e degré de difficulté) étaient notamment utilisés par les chasseurs de bouquetin.\nLe mont Jabal Ram (1734 m) a été gravi en 1949 par une équipe de géomètres guidés par Sheikh Hamdan. En 1952, les Européens Charmian Longstaff et Sylvia Branforddate réalisent la première ascension à but sportif, guidés par Sheikh Hamdan. Dans les années 1970-1980, Hammad Hamdan répète de nombreuses voies bédouines et réalise des ascensions en solo intégral jusqu'au 5e degré.\nLe début de la pratique de l'escalade moderne date de 1984, à la suite de l'invitation d'une équipe de grimpeurs britanniques par le ministère du Tourisme : Howard, Baker, Taylor et Shaw. Durant les années 1980, de nombreuses voies sont ouvertes par les Britanniques, ainsi que le guide français Colonna, les frères Remy, Haupolter et Precht. En 1987, Howard publie le premier guide des voies d'escalade de la région.\nEn 2000, Batoux, Petit et des amis ouvrent Guerre Sainte (7b +450m.), première voie d'escalade sportive entièrement équipée de pitons à expansion et premier big wall de la région. En 2015, le site de Wadi Rum comprend plus de 300 voies répertoriées, en grande majorité dédiées à l'escalade traditionnelle.\n\nLieu de tournage\nLa vallée a été le lieu de tournage de nombreux films ; pour des scènes de désert ou pour les paysages martiens de films de science-fiction :\n\nLawrence d’Arabie, 1962 certaines scènes se passant à Wadi Rum y furent tournées ;\nPlanète rouge, 2000 ;\nPassion in the Desert, 1998 ;\nTransformers 2, pour figurer l'Égypte ;\nPrometheus, figurant la planète des Aliens ;\nThe Last Days on Mars, 2013 ;\nSeul sur Mars, 2015 ;\nAladdin, 2019 ;\nStar Wars, épisode IX : L'Ascension de Skywalker, 2019 ;\nDune, 2020.\n\nLittérature\nSalah Stétié consacre à cette vallée un chapitre intitulé Une rose pour Wadi Ram dans Le Livre des déserts, itinéraires scientifiques, littéraires et spirituels, ouvrage collectif publié sous la direction de Bruno Doucey en 2005.\n\nRéférences\nLiens externes\n\nSite officiel\nRessource relative à l'architecture : Liste du patrimoine mondial  \n\n(en) Tony Howard, Treks and Climbs in Wadi Rum, Jordan, 1987-2015.\nEscalade en Jordanie : Wadi Rum sur Camptocamp.org\n\n Portail de la géographie   Portail de la Jordanie   Portail du patrimoine mondial   Portail des déserts",

          "content": "## Overview\nWadi Rum is a spectacularly scenic desert valley (wadi in Arabic) in southern Jordan. It is also known as \"Valley of the Moon\" and inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\n## Understand\nThis area of Jordan is quite isolated and largely inhospitable to settled life. The only permanent inhabitants are several thousand Bedouin nomads and villagers. There is no real infrastructure, leaving the area quite unspoilt. Apart from the Bedouin goat hair tents, the only structures are a few concrete shops and houses and the fort headquarters of the Desert Patrol Corps.\nWadi Rum is less a sandy desert but more a mountain desert. Very good pictures can also be taken from the area north of the Turkish rail track parallel to the road from the Aqaba highway to Wadi Rum. The best time to visit is Spring or Autumn, to avoid the cold winter nights and hot summer days. Photography is most dramatic in Wadi Rum when it is a little clouded, so you can experience the beautiful game of light and shadow in the desert.\nT E Lawrence (of Arabia) spent a significant amount of time here during the course of the British-inspired Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire during the First World War (1914–1918). Fans of the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia will be familiar with the landscape, which is not so much sand dunes as it is a mass of soaring cliffs and sandstone and granite mountains (jebel in Arabic).\nWadi Rum has also been used for more recent films, such as 2009's Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, where it stood in for part of Egypt. The distinctive reddish-orange sands that lend the area an otherworldly quality has brought the science-fiction films The Last Days on Mars and The Martian here to replicate the Red Planet on Earth, and the producers of the 2021 adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune to use as the desert planet Arrakis. The BBC documentary The Face follows two British climbers who pioneered routes in the canyons.\n\n## Get in\nWadi Rum is a short detour from the Desert Highway between Amman and Aqaba. A side road, 29.72478135.28271 40 km north of Aqaba, leads 21 km to the entrance where you will find the 29.6394435.4339972 Wadi Rum Visitors Centre, a police office and a lot of potential guides offering camel, 4x4 treks and camps. The cost to enter the Wadi Rum Protected Area is 5 JD per person (free with the Jordan Pass).\nMost buses that travel the highway between Aqaba and Petra/Amman should be able to drop you at the intersection to Wadi Rum, except the buses from Jett company. Once at the intersection, you can hitch hike (common in this part of Jordan, no problem for women alone) or take another minibus (1-2 JD, they seem to turn up quite regularly) to the Visitor's Centre where you can meet your guide or continue hitchhiking to 29.57401135.4208193 Wadi Rum Village (another 7 km). This final leg of the trip shouldn't cost more than 1-3 JD per person.\nAvoid the scammers in Petra who try to take you for a tour in the desert north to Wadi Rum for 80 JD. Ask specifically which sites they visit and whether it's in the reserve or not (there are no such things as \"Rum 1\" and \"Rum 2\"). However, some tourists are lodged outside of Wadi Rum, e.g. Disah, for more luxurious accommodation. Desert tours from camps outside of the reserve will be different from tours provided by companies and camps within Wadi Rum.\n\n## From Aqaba\nYou can get to Wadi Rum by catching any bus or minibus (1-3 JD) from the Aqaba bus station headed to Amman, Ma'an, or Petra and get off at the Wadi Rum turnoff. The turnoff is well-marked on the highway to Amman, about 40 km out of Aqaba. The buses run north every hour from 07:00-15:00, but another company (Afana) operates them until 22:00, perhaps at a slightly higher cost, however.\nThe Trust buses depart from its own stations, but basically all the other buses (including minibuses) depart from the main Aqaba bus station.\nThere is usually at least one direct bus from Aqaba to the Wadi Rum Visitor's Centre and the Wadi Rum Village per day. Be careful though if you plan to go to Wadi Rum on a Friday, it is very possible that these buses are not running (you should ideally go to the Bus Station and ask the drivers the day before). These buses:\n1) leave 2-3 times per day during the high season (Spring and Autumn). The last regular bus leaves at 13:00 (or possibly 15:00, according to this[dead link] and this[dead link], but don't count on it).\n2) leave once per day during the low season (summer and winter). There is a daily minibus from Wadi Rum Village to Aqaba that leaves at 06:30 (or 07:30 as of 2011—there is some disagreement), and this returns to Wadi Rum when it is full or the driver feels like it. The minibus journey should cost around 3 JD per person.\nA private taxi from Aqaba will cost you 25-35 JD depending on where you are in the city (though 30 JD is the price almost universally quote to tourists, and you may be hard-pressed to get most of them down even to 25 JD), and will take you to the Visitor's Centre. If you decide to make round trip you can arrange with taxi driver to wait for you at Visitor's Centre for 3-4 hours and take back. It will cost 40 JD. Taxi drivers usually suggest to take you there at 13:00 and take back after sunset. Taxis from the Israeli border cost around 35 JD.\n\n## From Petra\nThere is one bus per day from Wadi Musa (Petra) that leaves at 06:00 and costs 7 JD. The trip generally takes 1.5 hr and tickets should be booked through your hotel at Petra, it will then collect you from your hotel directly in the morning. The bus stops at the Visitor's Centre and Rum Village and returns to Wadi Musa for visitors travelling on to Petra (departure at 08:00 or 09:00).\nA tour including a taxi ride from Petra, 4 hours in Wadi Rum, not including the 5 JD/person entrance fee, and a taxi ride to the Israeli border cost 130 JD.\n\n## From Amman\nNo bus goes directly from Amman, but regular buses head towards Aqaba or Ma'an. Again, you can get off at the Wadi Rum Intersection (see above). Expect to pay not more than 12 JD, usually only 7 JD. Service taxis will also stop here for you and are generally quicker than the buses. This is not a private taxi, so it will pick up other passengers and make detours as the other passengers require. Service taxis should cost 15-25 JD per person.\nA relatively easy, but more expensive way is to take the JETT bus from Amman (4 hr, departs hourly, 8.60 JD, Oct 2018) to Aqaba, then a taxi (1 hr, 25-30 JD) to the Visitors' Centre.\n\n## 4x4\nPrivate vehicles are not prohibited past of the village of Wadi Rum. However, if you want to experience the grandeur that the Wadi has to offer, you will need to hire a guided camel or 4-wheel-drive (4WD) tour. Camels only move at walking pace so if you are on a short visit 4WD will allow a more comprehensive visit. The costs may vary based on the guide, the length of the trip, and your willingness and ability to bargain. You'd get the best price by contacting the local Bedouin directly. Most knowledgeable English speaking local guides are affiliated with family camps and contacting them in advance is advisable, you can research online to find a camp that suits your interests. The usual price is 50-75 JD per jeep for a 3-5 hr tour or 20 JD per camel/hour.\nThe 4x4 tours are basically driving around and stopping at several sights, taking short hikes, and having tea. Some tours are only going back and forth, taking 3 hr, for which 50 JD is quite expensive. So make sure, when booking your tour, to ensure a 4-5 hr round trip tour and understand which sites are included.\n\n## Hiking\nThe first camps are between 1-2 hr walking distance away from Wadi Rum village. So starting early, you might want to walk and check out 3 or 4 of these camps, and, if the prices do not fit you, walk back to go further to Aqaba or Petra. Walk out on either side of the valley along the wide truck tracks, depending on where you want to go, because the middle part of the valley is quite sandy and hard to walk on. Or book ahead knowing the name and location of your camp, by calling their number or through any of the common hotel websites. If you are good on foot, walking 10 km into Wadi Rum from the village for your tent is not a problem, but make sure to have a good map (not the one from the visitor's centre) and even GPS navigation.\nLocals will be willing to share sweet tea with you as you pass their tents but you should prepare adequate water and food for your journey. You can buy basic provisions in Wadi Rum Village where there are several shops.\nIf it is not too hot or you have enough water, you can also hike around instead of paying the 40-70 JD (per jeep) for a tour. You can even reach Umm Fruth Rock Bridge this way (20-25 km i.e. 5-6 hr round trip). It is likely to be picked up by one of the numerous trucks driving through the valley, saving you some distance.\n\n## Scams\nA scam in the area is that some taxi drivers in Aqaba or other places claim that they can arrange your tour to Wadi Rum. Actually they bring you to Shakariya village which is only a few kilometres away from Wadi Rum visitor centre. And the Bedouin there can also offer the 4x4 that drive you around the area just north of Wadi Rum Natural Reserve. The taxi driver profits from the ticket fee that they claim to pay to Wadi Rum and price difference between 4x4 in Wadi Rum. The scenery there is also very good, and the area also has something resembling the \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\" and the rock bridge in Wadi Rum. But this is not Wadi Rum after all. Some tourists are not even aware that they actually have never been to Wadi Rum after the tour.\n\"Guides\" from Petra will try to take you for a tour in the desert north to Wadi Rum for 80 JD. Ask specifically which sites they visit and whether it's in the reserve or not (there are no such things as \"Rum 1\" and \"Rum 2\"). You will know you have entered Wadi Rum reserve when you purchase a ticket at Wadi Rum Visitor Centre.\n\n## See\n29.50207635.4685791 Abu Kashaba Canyon. Sandy Canyon with desert tree, guided tours will drop visitors at one end and they can walk through the canyon to be collected at the other side.\n29.55599135.4529472 Anfashieh Inscriptions.

It was a filming location for the setting of the Cave of Wonders, in the 2019 live-action adaptation of the Disney film Aladdin.\n29.52044835.4234435 Khaz'ali Canyon. Arguably Wadi Rums best stand alone site, this narrow canyon contains numerous ancient inscriptions and petroglyphs—rock carvings of animals and humans.    (updated Mar 2020)\n29.52861935.4593096 Lawrence's House. Nobody is certain that this was Lawrence's house, although there are stories that he both stayed and/or stored weapons here. The current structure is built upon the remains of a Nabataean building, however, and it's another beautiful spot in the desert. The house itself is bunch of rubble, though, and not very impressive. Climb the rocks beside Lawrence House for a beautiful viewpoint overlooking the valley below.\n29.55980535.4103027 Lawrence Spring. 2 km south-west of the village of Rum. The spring is at the top of a short scramble—head for the fig tree! Although the pool itself is largely unprepossessing, being a stagnant puddle, the views across the desert are truly spectacular.

There are various places in Wadi Rum where the white and red sands meet, but the most commonly visited is a dune sloping up alongside a jebel. A bit tough to climb up, great fun to run down! It can be difficult ascending those—use small steps.\n29.63276335.45048611 Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Although most people can only count five (the remaining 2 are on the opposite side of the rock), this is an impressive rock formation near the Visitor's centre. It is named after T.E. Lawrence's book—not the other way around!\n29.46875735.44920912 Umm Fruth Rock Bridge. A 15-m rock bridge which is featured on many tours and can be easily scrambled to the top of.\n\n## Do\nThe genuine attraction of Wadi Rum is the desert itself, best seen by 4x4, on camel or foot. Some visitors only spend a few hours in the Wadi, but it's definitely worth staying overnight in Bedouin camps in the desert and taking a guided trip.\nThe quality 4-wheel-drive tour depends on Bedouin driver who serves as a guide, but often do not have much knowledge and poor English. Therefore, picking up a guide at the gate is a hit and miss affair and many of the best guides rely mainly on advance bookings. Many of the guides have websites, through which you can arrange your tour.\nThe desert landscapes and sandstone cliffs are themselves as much an attraction as any specific sites and the travelling between locations is often the highlight of the tours.\nHiking is possible, especially in colder low season.\nClimbing is another popular activity and a number of guides are also trained climbers. Scrambling the ancient Bedouin Routes to the summits is another great option. Not quite climbing, but more rewarding than a simple hike and can often be combined with climbing or abseiling and/or camping on top of a peak.\nThe Distant Heat Festival is held every summer on the last Thursday of July which features trance and electronic music.\nHot Air Ballooning is also possible for 100-150 JD. Various companies are available, search the Internet or try this one.\n\n## Eat & drink\nAt the entrance to the park, a small tent-restaurant serves simple Jordanian fare of bread, yogurt and such. However, there has been one report of food poisoning here.\nWhen you arrive at the Village there are a couple of shops where you can buy water and other soft drinks. Note that almost all the fruit juices are actually labelled as \"fruit drinks\", with sugar as the main ingredient. You might be able to find some pure fruit juice, such as Tropicana, if you look closely.\nThe village has a number of basic cafes that have falafel, coffee and other basics.\nMany camps will provide traditional Bedouin meals. One speciality is chicken or goat cooked under the desert sand, generically known as \"zarb\" in the same way as we might say \"a roast\". This has a barbecue flavour, but is very moist and falls off of the bone: try to be nearby when they unearth it as the smell released is gorgeous!\nYou won't be able to avoid the Bedouin tea, which is almost forcibly served in every tent you will visit. It's hot, very sweet and usually flavoured with mint and/or sage. It's surprisingly refreshing on a hot day and you may develop a slight addiction to it.\n\n## Sleep\nThere are Bedouin camps are throughout Wadi Rum Desert and require 4WD for access. The Wadi Rum Rest House in Wadi Rum Village no longer offers accommodation and you will only find a few home-stays listed if you are looking to sleep overnight in the village.\n\n## Camping\nWadi Rum Visitor Centre can provide a map marking official camping areas that available to the public. You are required to leave with all your belongings and any rubbish accumulated during your trip. Note that it will get very cold at night in the desert, even in summer.\n\n## Camps\nThere are several sleeping options, from a more formal camp ground to riding out into the desert with a Bedouin guide and staying in a traditional Bedouin tent. Expect to pay JOD25-60 for accommodation, transportation by 4x4 and food, depending on the type of tour and number of people. Most camps will organise the transport for their guests. Or choose adventure and to stay overnight under the stars or bivouac camping.\nFormal camps are the common appearance of accommodation in Wadi Rum. They are all pretty much similar, consisting of about 3-10 tents of 3x3m with beds, one big common area tent, regular toilet and even semi-warm shower, depending on the hours of sunlight. Power is provided most of the time (not just 5 h). These camps include dinner, breakfast and loads of tea. The standard price for them—assuming they already have at least 4 people there—seem to be 25 JD for a single, but if you are good at bargaining (in the middle of nowhere, or beforehand), you will get it down to 20 JD. This doesn't include transport. The price for two people occupying one tent should consequently be between 35-45 JD. Make sure to get the described conditions or research options before arrival, some people ended up in camps with less than that for pretty much the same price.\nApparently, on the usual booking sites such as Booking.com or Google Maps, you can even get a tent from 10 JD—in addition to a proper GPS location. The price however includes only bed and sometimes breakfast, expect to pay another 10 JD for dinner and 10 JD for one way transportation. If you book one of these very cheap options, it is advisable to contact them in advance to confirm . But, of course, this all depend on you negotiation skills.\nTo find the below listed camps, try a combination of OpenStreetMap, which many mobile Apps like OsmAnd or Mapy.cz use and which has many camp sites listed, or TripAdvisor (includes the name) and Booking.com (allows booking and contact) to locate the camps, in case you want to organise the transport and hike yourself. Or just head to Booking.com or Google Maps, where you will mostly always also have a GPS location, but should be reconfirmed with host.\n29.630535.50481 Abu Yousef Bedouin Camp and Travel Jordan Agency (Abu Yosef Bedouin Camp), Protected area of Wadi rum (the camp is at the edge of the protected area, near Disi Village), ☏ +962 785311117, info@traveljordanagency.com.

This seems especially true for young foreign travellers.\n\n## Go next\nJust as for getting in, the route out of Wadi Rum involves joining the Desert Highway that runs between Amman and Aqaba. Petra is two hours north, and Aqaba is half an hour south, and these are the most common destinations to travel on to after leaving Wadi Rum.\nThere are public minibuses that run every day at least to Petra and Amman, but these are pretty expensive (20 JD to Amman). Minibuses run mostly in the morning, ask at your camp to have a place booked. There are also numerous taxis waiting for tourists at the parking lot in the Wadi Rum village. Hitchhiking is the cheapest and often the fastest option to get somewhere else. A good way to hitchhike is to ask other tourists at your camp or at the parking lot to give you a ride in their rented car—you will probably find someone who is going to Petra or Aqaba.\n\n## To Aqaba\nThere is a daily minibus from Wadi Rum Village to Aqaba, it departs at 06:30, arriving about 07:30. 3 JD (2018).\nTaxis from Wadi Rum to Aqaba will cost around 20–35 JD, depending on your negotiation skills.\nTaxis from Wadi Rum to the Border Crossing (Israeli border) or Aqaba Airport should be similar priced based on the distance, but taxi drivers will try to charge you more due to the peculiarity of these destinations.\n\n## To Petra\nThere is a daily bus from the Wadi Rum Village to Wadi Musa (Petra) that departs around 08:30, takes around 2 hr, and costs 7.50–10 JD (Oct 2018) per person. Confirm the price with the driver in advance—including luggage which should not cost extra—to avoid any nasty surprises.\n\n## To Amman\nThere is a tourist minibus going from/to Amman everyday for 20 JD as of December 2018. Ask personnel at your accommodation to book you a seat.\nTaxis from Wadi Rum to Amman (and Queen Alia Airport) cost around 100–120 JD.",

          "content": "The Dead Sea (Arabic: اَلْبَحْر الْمَيِّت, romanized: al-Baḥr al-Mayyit; or اَلْبَحْر الْمَيْت, al-Baḥr al-Mayt; Hebrew: יַם הַמֶּלַח, romanized: Yam hamMelaḥ), also known by other names, is a landlocked salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east, the Israeli-occupied West Bank to the west and Israel to the southwest. It lies in the endorheic basin of the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.\nAs of 2025, the lake's surface is 439.78 metres (1,443 ft) below sea level, making its shores the lowest land-based elevation on Earth. It is 304 m (997 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342 g/kg, or 34.2% (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, 9.6 times as salty as the ocean—and has a density of 1.24 kg/litre, which makes swimming similar to floating. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea's main, northern basin is 50 kilometres (31 mi) long and 15 kilometres (9 mi) wide at its widest point.\nThe Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean basin for thousands of years. It was one of the world's first health resorts, and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilisers. Today, tourists visit the sea on its Israeli, Jordanian and West Bank coastlines.\nThe Dead Sea is receding at a swift rate; its surface area today is 605 km2 (234 sq mi), having been 1,050 km2 (410 sq mi) in 1930. Multiple canal and pipeline proposals, such as the scrapped Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance project, have been made to reduce its recession.\n\nNames\nThe English name \"Dead Sea\" is a calque of the Arabic name, itself a calque of earlier Greek and Latin names, in reference to the scarcity of aquatic life caused by the lake's extreme salinity.\nHistorical English names include the Salt Sea, Lake of Sodom from the biblical account of its destruction and Lake Asphaltites from Greek and Latin.\nThe name \"Dead Sea\" occasionally appears in Hebrew literature as Yām HamMāvet (ים המוות), 'Sea of Death'. However, the most common name for the lake in both biblical and modern Hebrew—and also its oldest known name—is the 'Sea of Salt' (Hebrew: ים המלח, romanized: Yām HamMelaḥ). Other Hebrew names for the lake also mentioned in the Bible are the Sea of Arabah (Hebrew: ים הערבה, romanized: Yām Ha'Ărāvâ) and the Eastern Sea (Hebrew: היםהקדמוני, romanized: HaYām HaQadmōnî). In the Talmud, it is called 'Sea of Salt' or 'Sea of Sodom'.\nThe Arabic name is al-Bahr al-Mayyit (البحر الميت), or usually without the article al-. It is also known in Arabic as the 'Sea of Lot' (Arabic: بحر لوط, romanized: baḥr Lūṭ, or بُحَيْرَة Buhayrat, بَحْرَة Bahret, or بِرْكَة لوط Birket Lūṭ) from the nephew of Abraham whose wife was said to have turned into a pillar of salt during the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Less often, it has been known in Arabic as the Sea of Zoara (بَحْر صُوغَر) from a formerly important city along its shores.\nBecause of the large volume of ancient trade in the lake's naturally occurring free-floating bitumen, its usual names in ancient Greek and Roman geography were some form of Asphalt Lake (Ancient Greek: Ἀσφαλτίτης, romanized: Asphaltítēs; or no: Ἀσφαλτίτις Λίμνη, romanized: Asphaltítis Límnē; Latin: Lacus Asphaltites) or Asphalt Sea (Ἀσφαλτίτης Θάλασσα, Asphaltítēs Thálassa).\nIt was also known as the 'Dead Sea' (Ancient Greek: Νεκρά Θάλασσα, romanized: Nekrá Thálassa; Latin: Mare Mortuum). Another ancient name is the \"Jewish Sea,\" (Latin: Iudaicum mare), a term used by the second-century Roman historian Tacitus.\n\nGeography\nThe Dead Sea is a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and Palestine's Israeli-occupied West Bank and Israel to the west. It is an endorheic lake, meaning there are no outlet streams.\nThe Dead Sea lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, a geographic feature formed by the Dead Sea Transform (DST). This left lateral-moving transform fault lies along the tectonic plate boundary between the African Plate and the Arabian Plate. It runs between the East Anatolian Fault zone in Turkey and the northern end of the Red Sea Rift offshore of the southern tip of Sinai.\nWater feeds into the Dead Sea from various sources, many small or intermittent, including:\n\nJordan River, international border from the north\nArava Stream (Wadi Arava), international border from the south\nWadi Mujib (Arnon Stream), Jordan, Karak Governorate\nWadi Darga (Wadi Darajeh, Nahal Darga, or Nahal Dragot), West Bank\nWadi al-Hasa (Brook of Zered), Jordan, boundary between Karak Governorate and Tafilah Governorate\nNahal Arugot (Wadi Areijeh or Wadi Argot), mouth at Ein Gedi, Israel\nWadi Wala, Jordan side\nWadi Zarqa Ma'in, Jordan side\nNahal Tur, West Bank\nNahal Og, West Bank\nGroundwater seepage\nDirect rainfall\n(Wadi is the Arabic term for a river valley with a small or intermittent stream; Nahal is the equivalent in Hebrew. The two terms are often used interchangeably in English names for the same body of water.)\nThe water of Wadi Hassa is now completely consumed in Jordan. The Jordan River, which passes through the Sea of Galilee, has been substantially diverted. It currently only contributes about one-sixth of the inflow to the Dead Sea, less than direct rainfall.\nThere are also small perennial springs under and around the Dead Sea, forming pools and quicksand pits along the edges.\nThe Wadi Mujib valley, 420 m below the sea level in the southern part of the Jordan valley, is a biosphere reserve, with an area of 212 km2 (82 sq mi).\nRainfall is scarcely 100 mm (4 in) per year in the northern part of the Dead Sea and barely 50 mm (2 in) in the southern part. The Dead Sea zone's aridity is due to the rainshadow effect of the Judaean Mountains. The highlands east of the Dead Sea receive more rainfall than the Dead Sea itself.\nTo the west of the Dead Sea, the Judaean mountains rise less steeply and are much lower than the mountains to the east. Along the southwestern side of the lake is a 210 m (700 ft) tall halite mineral formation called Mount Sodom.\n\nGeology\nFormation theories\nThere are two contending hypotheses about the origin of the low elevation of the Dead Sea. The older hypothesis is that the Dead Sea lies in a true rift zone, an extension of the Red Sea Rift, or even of the Great Rift Valley of eastern Africa. A more recent hypothesis is that the Dead Sea basin is a consequence of a \"step-over\" discontinuity along the Dead Sea Transform, creating an extension of the crust with consequent subsidence.\n\nSedom Lagoon\nDuring the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene, what is now the valley of the Jordan River, Dead Sea, and the northern Wadi Arabah was repeatedly inundated by waters from the Mediterranean Sea. The waters formed in a narrow, crooked bay that is called by geologists the Sedom Lagoon, which was connected to the sea through what is now the Jezreel Valley. The floods of the valley came and went depending on long-scale changes in the tectonic and climatic conditions.\nThe Sedom Lagoon extended at its maximum from the Sea of Galilee in the north to somewhere around 50 km (30 mi) south of the current southern end of the Dead Sea, and the subsequent lakes never surpassed this expanse. The Hula Depression was never part of any of these water bodies due to its higher elevation and the high threshold of the Korazim block separating it from the Sea of Galilee basin.\n\nSalt deposits\nThe Sedom Lagoon deposited evaporites mainly consisting of rock salt, which eventually reached a thickness of 2.3 km (1.43 mi) on the old basin floor in the area of today's Mount Sedom.\n\nLake formation\nAccording to Kafri, during the late Neogene, i.e. in the Pliocene (ended c. 2.5 million years ago), the eustatic sea level was at 50–100 metres above the current sea level, thus flooding the northern valleys connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the Jordan Rift Valley, which led to the creation of a crooked-shaped lagoon. This high eustatic sea level situation subsequently came to an end, and the ocean could no longer flood the area. Thus, the long lagoon became a landlocked lake, which – due to the high evaporation rate – retreated toward the lower, southern part of the rift valley. However, Mordechai Stein considers the formation process as not yet clarified, speaking of a late Pliocene-early Pleistocene process in which tectonics might also have played a part in blocking water ingression from the Mediterranean to its former bay or lagoon.\nThe first prehistoric lake to follow the Sedom Lagoon is named Lake Amora (which possibly appeared in the early Pleistocene; its sediments developed into the Amora (Samra) Formation, dated to over 200–80 kyr BP), followed by Lake Lisan (c. 70–14 kyr) and finally by the Dead Sea.\n\nLake salinity\nThe water levels and salinity of the successive lakes (Amora, Lisan, Dead Sea) have either risen or fallen as an effect of the tectonic dropping of the valley bottom, and due to climate variation. As the climate became more arid, Lake Lisan finally shrank and became saltier, leaving the Dead Sea as its last remainder.\nFrom 70,000 to 12,000 years ago, Lake Lisan's level was 100 to 250 m (330 to 820 ft) higher than its current level, possibly due to lower evaporation than in the present. Its level fluctuated dramatically, rising to its highest level around 26,000 years ago, indicating a very wet climate in the Near East. Around 10,000 years ago, the lake's level dropped dramatically, probably even lower than today. During the last several thousand years, the lake has fluctuated approximately 400 m (1,300 ft), with some significant drops and rises. Current theories as to the cause of this dramatic drop in levels rule out volcanic activity; therefore, it may have been a seismic event.\n\nSalt mounts formation\nIn prehistoric times, great amounts of sediment collected on the floor of Lake Amora. The sediment was heavier than the salt deposits and squeezed the salt deposits upwards into what are now the Lisan Peninsula and Mount Sodom (on the southwest side of the lake). Geologists explain the effect in terms of a bucket of mud into which a large flat stone is placed, forcing the mud to creep up the sides of the bucket. When the floor of the Dead Sea dropped further due to tectonic forces, the salt mounts of Lisan and Mount Sodom stayed in place as high cliffs (see salt dome).\n\nClimate\nThe Dead Sea has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), with year-round sunny skies and dry air. It has less than 50 millimetres (2 in) mean annual rainfall and a summer average temperature between 32 and 39 °C (90 and 102 °F). Winter average temperatures range between 20 and 23 °C (68 and 73 °F). The region has weaker ultraviolet radiation, particularly the UVB (erythrogenic rays). Given the higher atmospheric pressure, the air has a slightly higher oxygen content (3.3% in summer to 4.8% in winter) as compared to oxygen concentration at sea level. Barometric pressures at the Dead Sea were measured between 1061 and 1065 hPa and clinically compared with health effects at higher altitude. (This barometric measure is about 5% higher than sea level standard atmospheric pressure of 1013.25 hPa, which is the global ocean mean or ATM.) The Dead Sea affects temperatures nearby because of the moderating effect a large body of water has on climate. During the winter, sea temperatures tend to be higher than land temperatures, and vice versa during the summer months. This is the result of the water's mass and specific heat capacity. On average, there are 192 days above 30 °C (86 °F) annually.\n\nChemistry\nWith 34.2% salinity (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, though Lake Vanda in Antarctica (35%), Lake Assal in Djibouti (34.8%), Lagoon Garabogazköl in the Caspian Sea (up to 35%) and some hypersaline ponds and lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica (such as Don Juan Pond (44%)) have reported higher salinities.\nIn the 19th century and the early 20th century, the surface layers of the Dead Sea were less salty than today, which resulted in an average density in the range of 1.15–1.17 g/cm3 instead of the present value of around 1.25 g/cm3. A sample tested by Bernays in the 19th century had a salinity of 19%. By the year 1926, the salinity had increased (although it was also suspected that the salinity varies seasonally and depends on the distance from the mouth of the Jordan).\nUntil the winter of 1978–79, when a major mixing event took place, the Dead Sea was composed of two stratified layers of water that differed in temperature, density, age, and salinity. The topmost 35 meters (115 ft) or so of the Dead Sea had an average salinity of about 30%, and a temperature that swung between 19 and 37 °C (66 and 99 °F). Underneath a zone of transition, the lowest level of the Dead Sea had waters of a consistent 22 °C (72 °F) temperature, salinity of over 34%, and complete saturation of sodium chloride (NaCl). Since the water near the bottom is saturated with NaCl, that salt precipitates out of solution onto the sea floor.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, water inflow to the Dead Sea from the Jordan River was reduced as a result of large-scale irrigation and generally low rainfall. By 1975, the upper water layer was saltier than the lower layer. Nevertheless, the upper layer remained suspended above the lower layer because its waters were warmer and thus less dense. When the upper layer cooled so its density was greater than the lower layer, the waters mixed (1978–79). For the first time in centuries, the lake was a homogeneous body of water. Since then, stratification has begun to redevelop.\nThe mineral content of the Dead Sea is very different from that of ocean water. The exact composition of the Dead Sea water varies mainly with season, depth and temperature. In the early 1980s, the concentration of ionic species (in g/kg) of Dead Sea surface water was Cl− (181.4), Br− (4.2), SO42− (0.4), HCO3− (0.2), Ca2+ (14.1), Na+ (32.5), K+ (6.2) and Mg2+ (35.2). The total salinity was 276 g/kg. These results show that the composition of the salt, as anhydrous chlorides on a weight percentage basis, was calcium chloride (CaCl2) 14.4%, potassium chloride (KCl) 4.4%, magnesium chloride (MgCl2) 50.8% and sodium chloride (NaCl) 30.4%. In comparison, the salt in the water of most oceans and seas is approximately 85% sodium chloride. The concentration of sulfate ions (SO42−) is very low, and the concentration of bromide ions (Br−) is the highest of all waters on Earth.\n\nThe salt concentration of the Dead Sea fluctuates around 31.5%. This is unusually high and results in a nominal density of 1.24 kg/L. Anyone can easily float in the Dead Sea because of natural buoyancy. In this respect the Dead Sea is similar to the Great Salt Lake in Utah in the United States.\nAn unusual feature of the Dead Sea is its discharge of asphalt. From deep seeps, the Dead Sea constantly spits up small pebbles and blocks of the black substance. Asphalt-coated figurines and bitumen-coated Neolithic skulls from archaeological sites have been found. Egyptian mummification processes used asphalt imported from the Dead Sea region.\n\nPutative therapies\nThe Dead Sea area has become a location for health research and potential treatment for several reasons. The mineral content of the water, the low content of pollens and other allergens in the atmosphere, the reduced ultraviolet component of solar radiation, and the higher atmospheric pressure at this great depth each may have specific health effects. For example, persons experiencing reduced respiratory function from diseases such as cystic fibrosis seem to benefit from the increased atmospheric pressure.\nThe region's climate and low elevation have made it a popular center for assessment of putative therapies:\n\nClimatotherapy: Treatment which exploits local climatic features such as temperature, humidity, sunshine, barometric pressure and special atmospheric constituents\nHeliotherapy: Treatment that exploits the biological effects of the sun's radiation\nThalassotherapy: Treatment that exploits bathing in Dead Sea water\nThere is evidence that the  unique attenuation and spectrum of UV rays near the Dead Sea contribute to effective photoclimatherapy for psoriasis, in part because the reduced exposure to solar radiation allows for longer periods of sunbathing.\nRhinosinusitis patients receiving Dead Sea saline nasal irrigation exhibited improved symptom relief compared to standard hypertonic saline spray in one study.\nDead Sea mud pack therapy has been suggested to temporarily relieve pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knees. According to researchers of the Ben Gurion University of the Negev, treatment with mineral-rich mud compresses can be used to augment conventional medical therapy.\n\nLife forms\nThe sea is called \"dead\" because its high salinity prevents macroscopic aquatic organisms, such as fish and aquatic plants, from living in it, though minuscule quantities of bacteria and microbial fungi are present.\nIn times of flood, the salt content of the Dead Sea can drop from its usual 35% to 30% or lower. It temporarily comes to life in the wake of rainy winters. In 1980, after one such rainy winter, the normally dark blue Dead Sea turned red. Researchers from Hebrew University of Jerusalem found it to be teeming with an alga called Dunaliella. Dunaliella in turn nourished carotenoid-containing (red-pigmented) halobacteria, whose presence caused the color change. Since 1980, the basin has been dry and the algae and the bacteria have not returned in measurable numbers.\nIn 2011 a group of scientists from Be'er Sheva, Israel and Germany discovered fissures in the floor of the Dead Sea by scuba diving and observing the surface. These fissures allow fresh and brackish water to enter. They sampled biofilms surrounding the fissures and discovered numerous species of bacteria and archaea.\n\nHuman settlement\nThere are several small communities near the Dead Sea. These include Ein Gedi, Neve Zohar and the Israeli settlements in the Megilot Regional Council: Kalya, Mitzpe Shalem and Avnat. There is a nature preserve at Ein Gedi, and several Dead Sea hotels are located on the southwest end at Ein Bokek near Neve Zohar. Highway 90 runs north–south on the Israeli side for a total distance of 565 km (351 mi) from Metula on the Lebanese border in the north to its southern terminus at the Egyptian border near the Red Sea port of Eilat.\nPotash City is a small community on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, and others including Suweima. Highway 65 runs north–south on the Jordanian side from near Jordan's northern tip down past the Dead Sea to the port of Aqaba.\n\nHuman history\nBiblical period\nDwelling in caves near the Dead Sea is recorded in the Hebrew Bible as having taken place before the Israelites came to Canaan, and extensively at the time of King David.\nJust northwest of the Dead Sea is Jericho. Somewhere, perhaps on the southeastern shore, would be the cities mentioned in the Book of Genesis which were said to have been destroyed in the time of Abraham: Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 18) and the three other \"Cities of the Plain\", Admah, Zeboim and Zoar (Deuteronomy 29:23). Zoar escaped destruction when Abraham's nephew Lot escaped to Zoar from Sodom (Genesis 19:21–22). Before the destruction, the Dead Sea was a valley full of natural tar pits, which was called the vale of Siddim. King David was said to have hidden from Saul at Ein Gedi nearby.\nIn Ezekiel 47:8–9 there is a specific prophecy that the sea will \"be healed and made fresh\", becoming a normal lake capable of supporting marine life. A similar prophecy is stated in Zechariah 14:8, which says that \"living waters will go out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea [likely the Dead Sea] and half to the western sea [the Mediterranean].\"\nDuring the First Temple period, the kingdom of Judah ruled the western shore of the Dead Sea, while Moab controlled the eastern shore. To the south were the Edomites. Judah established several fortresses along its side of the sea. Development in this area was likely driven by new economic opportunities arising from the Dead Sea's natural resources, including salt, bitumen, as well as cash crops. Both Ein Gedi and Jericho on Judah's side were vital centers for cultivating the highly prized Judean date palms during this time. Ein Gedi thrived as a major economic hub in the final century of Judah, before its destruction on the eve of the Babylonian captivity.\n\nHellenistic and Roman period\nGreek and Jewish writers report that the Nabateans had monopolistic control over the Dead Sea.\n\nArchaeological evidence shows multiple anchorages existing on both sides of the sea, including in Ein Gedi, Khirbet Mazin (where the ruins of a Hasmonean-era dry dock are located), Numeira and near Masada. Josephus identified the Dead Sea in geographic proximity to the ancient Biblical city of Sodom. However, he referred to the lake by its Greek name, Asphaltites.\nHerod the Great, king of Judaea, built or rebuilt several fortresses and palaces along the western shore of the Dead Sea, with Masada being the most famous. Another historically important fortress was Machaerus (מכוור), on the eastern bank, where, according to Josephus, John the Baptist was imprisoned by Herod Antipas and died.\nDuring the Hellenistic and Roman periods, some Essenes, an ascetic Jewish sect, settled along the western shore of the Dead Sea. Roman historian Pliny the Elder identifies their location with the words, \"on the west side of the Dead Sea, away from the coast... [above] the town of Engeda\" (Natural History, Bk 5.73). Based on this, It is widely accepted, though still debated, that the Jewish community at Qumran was part of the Essene sect, and that the \"Dead Sea Scrolls\" discovered in nearby caves during the 20th century were their library.\nThe Dead Sea region was active during the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE). Early in the conflict, a group of Sicarii, a radical Jewish sect, seized control of the fortress of Masada and killed the Roman garrison stationed there. After their leader was killed in Jerusalem, the Sicarii fled to Masada and took refuge in the fortress. In 68 CE, Roman commander Vespasian, tasked with suppressing the Jewish revolt, arrived at the Dead Sea and tested its buoyancy by throwing bound, non-swimmer captives into the water. Archaeological evidence suggests that around this time, the Qumran community was destroyed. The Sicarii at Masada continued to resist the Romans after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, holding out until 73/74 CE, when a siege by the Roman Legio X Fretensis resulted in the deaths of 960 inhabitants by suicide, according to Josephus. The Roman camps surrounding Masada were constructed by Jewish slaves who received water from nearby towns, which were supplied with drinking water from the Ein Feshcha springs and other nearby sweetwater sources.\n\nThe town of Ein Gedi, mentioned many times in the Mishna, produced persimmon for the temple's fragrance and for export, using a secret recipe. \"Sodomite salt\" was an essential mineral for the temple's holy incense, but was said to be dangerous for home use and could cause blindness.\n\nByzantine period\nThe sixth-century mosaic known as the Madaba Map indicates that trade across the Dead Sea was very prevalent during the Byzantine period. \nConnected with the Judean wilderness to its northwest and west, the Dead Sea was a place of escape and refuge. The remoteness of the region attracted Greek Orthodox monks since the Byzantine era. Their monasteries, such as Saint George in Wadi Kelt and Mar Saba in the Judaean Desert, are places of pilgrimage.\nThe Jewish village of Ein Gedi, which had been continuously inhabited since the 5th century BCE, was destroyed in the 7th century by a devastating fire.\n\nMedieval period\nFrom the seventh century onwards, the Dead Sea area entered a period of decline and its population decreased. The cultivation of sugarcane near the northern and southern shores of the lake began to develop during the Crusader period and reached its peak under the Mamluks.\n\nModern times\nIn the 19th century the River Jordan and the Dead Sea were explored by boat primarily by Christopher Costigan in 1835, Thomas Howard Molyneux in 1847, William Francis Lynch in 1848, and John MacGregor in 1869. The full text of W. F. Lynch's 1849 book Narrative of the United States' Expedition to the River Jordan and the Dead Sea is available online. Charles Leonard Irby and James Mangles travelled along the shores of the Dead Sea already in 1817–18, but didn't navigate on its waters.\n\nExplorers and scientists arrived in the area to analyze the minerals and research the unique climate.\nAfter the find of the \"Moabite Stone\" in 1868 on the plateau east of the Dead Sea, Moses Wilhelm Shapira and his partner Salim al-Khouri forged and sold a whole range of presumed \"Moabite\" antiquities, and in 1883 Shapira presented what is now known as the \"Shapira Strips\", a supposedly ancient scroll written on leather strips which he claimed had been found near the Dead Sea. The strips were declared to be forgeries and Shapira took his own life in disgrace.\nThe 1922 census of Palestine lists 100 people (68 Muslims and 32 Christians) with \"Dead Sea & Jordan\" as their main locality. The 1931 census shows a sharp increase with 535 people (264 Muslims, 230 Jews, 21 Christians, 17 Druze, and three with no religion) listing \"Dead Sea\" as their main village/town. The 1938 nor 1945 village statistics does not give a number for the general Dead Sea area.\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, hundreds of Jewish religious documents dated between 150 BCE and 70 CE were found in caves near the ancient settlement of Qumran, about one mile (1.6 kilometres) inland from the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea (presently in the West Bank). They became known and famous as the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nThe world's lowest roads, Highway 90, run along the Israeli and West Bank shores of the Dead Sea, along with Highway 65 on the Jordanian side, at 393 m (1,289 ft) below sea level.\n\nTourism and leisure\nBritish Mandate period\nA golf course named for Sodom and Gomorrah was built by the British at Kalia on the northern shore.\n\nIsrael\nThe first major Israeli hotels were built in nearby Arad, and since the 1960s at the Ein Bokek resort complex.\nIsrael has 15 hotels along the Dead Sea shore, generating total revenues of $291 million in 2012. Most Israeli hotels and resorts on the Dead Sea are on a six-kilometre (3.7-mile) stretch of the southern shore.\n\nJordan\nOn the Jordanian side, nine international franchises have opened seaside resort hotels near the King Hussein Bin Talal Convention Center, along with resort apartments, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. The 9 hotels have boosted the Jordanian side's capacity to 2,800 rooms.\nOn 22 November 2015, the Dead Sea panorama road was included along with 40 archaeological locations in Jordan, to become live on Google Street View.\n\nPalestine (West Bank)\nThe portion of Dead Sea coast which Palestinians could possibly eventually manage is about 40 kilometres (25 miles) long. The World Bank estimates that such Dead Sea tourism industry could generate $290 million of revenues per year and 2,900 jobs. However, Palestinians have been unable to obtain construction permits for tourism-related investments on the Dead Sea. According to the World Bank, officials in the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities state that the only way to apply for such permits is through the Joint Committees established under the Oslo Agreement, but the relevant committee has not met with any degree of regularity since 2000.\n\nChemical industry\nBritish Mandate period\nIn the early part of the 20th century, the Dead Sea began to attract interest from chemists who deduced the sea was a natural deposit of potash (potassium chloride) and bromine. A concession was granted by the British Mandatory government to the newly formed Palestine Potash Company in 1929. Its founder, Siberian Jewish engineer and pioneer of Lake Baikal exploitation, Moses Novomeysky, had worked for the charter for over ten years having first visited the area in 1911. The first plant, on the north shore of the Dead Sea at Kalya, commenced production in 1931 and produced potash by solar evaporation of the brine. Employing Arabs and Jews, it was an island of peace in turbulent times. In 1934 a second plant was built on the southwest shore, in the Mount Sodom area, south of the 'Lashon' region of the Dead Sea. Palestine Potash Company supplied half of Britain's potash during World War II. Both plants were destroyed by the Jordanians in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.\n\nIsrael\nThe Dead Sea Works was founded in 1952 as a state-owned enterprise based on the remnants of the Palestine Potash Company. In 1995, the company was privatized and it is now owned by Israel Chemicals. From the Dead Sea brine, Israel produces (2001) 1.77 million tons potash, 206,000 tons elemental bromine, 44,900 tons caustic soda, 25,000 tons magnesium metal, and sodium chloride. Israeli companies generate around US$3 billion annually from the sale of Dead Sea minerals (primarily potash and bromine), and from other products that are derived from Dead Sea Minerals.\n\nJordan\nOn the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, Arab Potash (APC), formed in 1956, produces 2.0 million tons of potash annually, as well as sodium chloride and bromine. The plant is located at Safi, South Aghwar Department, in the Karak Governorate.\nJordanian Dead Sea mineral industries generate about $1.2 billion in sales (equivalent to 4 percent of Jordan's GDP).\n\nWest Bank\nThe Palestinian Dead Sea Coast is about 40 kilometres (25 miles) long. The Palestinian economy is unable to benefit from Dead Sea chemicals due to restricted access, permit issues and the uncertainties of the investment climate. The World Bank estimates that a Palestinian Dead Sea chemicals industry could generate $918M incremental value added per year, \"almost equivalent to the contribution of the entire manufacturing sector of Palestinian territories today\".\n\nExtraction\nBoth companies, Dead Sea Works Ltd. and Arab Potash, use extensive salt evaporation pans that have essentially diked the entire southern end of the Dead Sea for the purpose of producing carnallite, potassium magnesium chloride, which is then processed further to produce potassium chloride. The ponds are separated by a central dike that runs roughly north–south along the international border. The power plant on the Israeli side allows production of magnesium metal (by a subsidiary, Dead Sea Magnesium Ltd.).\nDue to the popularity of the sea's therapeutic and healing properties, several companies have also shown interest in the manufacturing and supplying of Dead Sea salts as raw materials for body and skin care products.\n\nRecession and environmental concerns\nReceding shoreline\nSince 1930, when its surface was 1,050 km2 (410 sq mi) and its level was 390 m (1,280 ft) below sea level, the Dead Sea has been monitored continuously. The Dead Sea has been rapidly shrinking since the 1960s because of diversion of incoming water from the Jordan River to the north as part of the National Water Carrier scheme, completed in 1964. The southern end is fed by a canal maintained by the Dead Sea Works, a company that converts the sea's raw materials. From a water surface of 395 m (1,296 ft) below sea level in 1970 it fell 22 to 418 m (72 to 1,371 ft) below sea level in 2006, reaching a drop rate of 1 m (3 ft) per year.  By 2025 it reached a height of 439 m (1,440 ft) below sea level, a drop of more than 1 m (3 ft) per year. As the water level decreases, the characteristics of the Sea and surrounding region may substantially change.\nAs of 2021, the surface of the Sea has shrunk by about 33 percent since the 1960s, which is partly attributed to the much-reduced flow of the Jordan River since the construction of the National Water Carrier project, and the amount of water from the rains reaching the Dead Sea has diminished even further since flash floods started pouring into the sinkholes left by its shrinkage. The EcoPeace Middle East, a joint Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian environmental group, has estimated that the annual flow into the Dead Sea from the Jordan is as of 2021 less than 100,000,000 cubic metres (3.5×109 cu ft) of water, compared with former flows of between 1,200,000,000 cubic metres (4.2×1010 cu ft) and 1,300,000,000 cubic metres (4.6×1010 cu ft).\n\nSources: Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research, Haaretz, Jordan Valley Authority.\n\nSinkholes and their impact\nThe Dead Sea level drop has been followed by a groundwater level drop, causing brines that used to occupy underground layers near the shoreline to be flushed out by freshwater. This is believed to be the cause of the recent appearance of large sinkholes along the western shore—incoming freshwater dissolves salt layers, rapidly creating subsurface cavities that subsequently collapse to form these sinkholes. As of 2021 Ein Gedi, on the western coast, has been subject to a large number of sinkholes appearing in the area, attributed to the decline in the water level of the Dead Sea.\nAs a result of the sinkholes, most beach resorts along the west shore of the northern basin had to be shut down, with just three remaining near the basin's northwest tip (see List of beaches in Palestine: Dead Sea).\n\nLink to the Red Sea\nIn May 2009 at the World Economic Forum, Jordan introduced plans for a \"Jordan National Red Sea Development Project\" (JRSP). This is a plan to convey seawater from the Red Sea near Aqaba to the Dead Sea. Water would be desalinated along the route to provide fresh water to Jordan, with the brine discharge sent to the Dead Sea for replenishment. Israel has expressed its support and will likely benefit from some of the water delivery to its Negev region.\nAt a regional conference in July 2009, officials expressed concern about the declining water levels. Some suggested industrial activities around the Dead Sea might need to be reduced. Others advised environmental measures to restore conditions such as increasing the volume of flow from the Jordan River to replenish the Dead Sea. Currently, only sewage and effluent from fish ponds run in the river's channel. Experts also stressed the need for strict conservation efforts. They said agriculture should not be expanded, sustainable support capabilities should be incorporated into the area and pollution sources should be reduced.\nIn October 2009, the Jordanians accelerated plans to extract around 300 million cubic metres (11 billion cubic feet) of water per year from the Red Sea, desalinate it for use as fresh water and send the waste water to the Dead Sea by tunnel, despite concerns about inadequate time to assess the potential environmental impact. According to Jordan's minister for water, General Maysoun Zu'bi, this project could be considered as the first phase of the Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance.\nIn December 2013, Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement for laying a water pipeline to link the Red Sea with the Dead Sea. The pipeline would be 180 km (110 mi) long and is estimated to take up to five years to complete. In January 2015 it was reported that the level of water was dropping by 1 m (3.3 ft) a year.\nOn 27 November 2016, the Jordanian government shortlisted five consortia to implement the project. Jordan's ministry of Water and Irrigation said that the $100 million first phase of the project would begin construction in the first quarter of 2018, and would be completed by 2021. The project was officially abandoned in June 2021, having never broken ground.\n\nSee also\nAral Sea\nList of bodies of water by salinity\nList of drying lakes\nList of places on land with elevations below sea level\nMediterranean–Dead Sea Canal\nBenjamin Elazari Volcani\nPEF rock with the Dead Sea level reference line used between 1900 and 1913\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nThe World Bank, 2013, \"The Red Sea – Dead Sea Water Conveyance Study Program\", and source of basic data on the Dead Sea.\nYehouda Enzel, et al., eds (2006) New Frontiers in Dead Sea Paleoenvironmental Research, Geological Society of America, ISBN 978-0-8137-2401-0\nNiemi, Tina M., Ben-Avraham, Z., and Gat, J., eds., 1997, The Dead Sea: The Lake and Its Setting: N.Y., Oxford University Press, 286 p.\nWorld Bank, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Department, Area C and the Future of the Palestinian Economy, October 2, 2013\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Dead Sea at Wikimedia Commons\n Dead Sea travel guide from Wikivoyage   (Israeli and West Bank part and Jordanian part)\n The dictionary definition of Dead Sea at Wiktionary\nPorter, Josias Leslie (1878). \"Dead Sea\" .

          "summary": "The Dead Sea (Arabic: اَلْبَحْر الْمَيِّت, romanized: al-Baḥr al-Mayyit; or اَلْبَحْر الْمَيْت, al-Baḥr al-Mayt; Hebrew: יַם הַמֶּלַח, romanized: Yam hamMelaḥ), also known by other names, is a landlocked salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east, the Israeli-occupied West Bank to the west and Israel to the southwest. It lies in the endorheic basin of the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.\nAs of 2025, the lake's surface is 439.78 metres (1,443 ft) below sea level, making its shores the lowest land-based elevation on Earth. It is 304 m (997 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342 g/kg, or 34.2% (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, 9.6 times as salty as the ocean—and has a density of 1.24 kg/litre, which makes swimming similar to floating. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea's main, northern basin is 50 kilometres (31 mi) long and 15 kilometres (9 mi) wide at its widest point.\nThe Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean basin for thousands of years. It was one of the world's first health resorts, and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilisers. Today, tourists visit the sea on its Israeli, Jordanian and West Bank coastlines.\nThe Dead Sea is receding at a swift rate; its surface area today is 605 km2 (234 sq mi), having been 1,050 km2 (410 sq mi) in 1930. Multiple canal and pipeline proposals, such as the scrapped Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance project, have been made to reduce its recession.",

          "content": "البحر الميت هو بحيرة ملحية مغلقة تقع في أخدود وادي الأردن ضمن الشق السوري الأفريقي، على خط الحدود الفاصل بين الأردن وفلسطين التاريخية (الضفة الغربية والداخل المحتل). يشتهر البحر الميت بأنه أخفض نقطة على سطح الكرة الأرضية، حيث بلغ منسوب شاطئه حوالي 400 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر حسب سجلات عام 2013. كما يتميز البحر الميت بشدة ملوحته، إذ تبلغ نسبة الأملاح فيه حوالي 34%، وهي ما تمثل تسعة أضعاف تركيز الأملاح في البحر المتوسط، وواحدة من أعلى نسب الملوحة بالمسطحات المائية في العالم. وقد نتجت هذه الأملاح لأن البحيرة هي وجهة نهائية للمياه التي تصب فيه، حيث أنه لا يوجد أي مخرج لها بعده.\nيصل عرض البحر الميت في أقصى حد إلى 17 كم، بينما يبلغ طوله حوالي 70 كم. وقد بلغت مساحته في عام 2010 حوالي 650 كم2 إذ تقلصت خلال الأربع عقود الماضية بما يزيد عن 35%. كما يلعب المناخ الصحراوي للمنطقة الذي يمتاز بشدة الحرارة والجفاف ومعدلات التبخر العالية دورًا كبيرًا في زيادة تركيز تلك الأملاح فيه.\nلقد عانى منسوب البحر الميت مؤخرًا من التراجع المستمر، حيث يرجع هذا الأمر إلى عدد من الأسباب الرئيسية، كالاستخدام المكثف لمصادر المياه، وأهمها نهر الأردن، وضخ المياه في الحوض الجنوبي، حيث يتكون البحر الميت حاليًا من حوضين؛ شمالي وجنوبي يقسمهما شبه جزيرة اللسان. ونتيجة للانخفاض المستمر لهذا المستوى، تعرض الجزء الجنوبي من البحيرة للجفاف، حيث إنّ الجزء الجنوبي أقل عمقًا من نظيره الشمالي، ويصل ارتفاع منسوب شاطئه إلى 401 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر. ومع تجفيف الجزء الجنوبي، تم إنشاء برك لتبخير المياه وإنتاج البوتاس والمواد الكيماوية الأخرى مثل المنجنيز والمغنسيوم والبرومين في مصانع البوتاس الإسرائيلية، وشركة البوتاس العربية في الأردن. وتحتاج تلك البرك إلى ضخ كبير من مياه البحر الميت وتبخيرها، مما أثّر تأثيرًا كبيرًا على زيادة انخفاض مستوى سطح البحر.\nلقد بلغ المعدل السنوي لانخفاض مستوى سطح البحر خلال العقد المنصرم بمقدار يعادل الفقدان لمدة سنة كاملة، حيث أصبح المستوى ينخفض حوالي متر واحد كل عام. ولقد زاد هذا المعدل في عام 2012 بشكل واضح، فكان انخفاض مستوى البحر 1.40 متر. وقد أدى الانخفاض التراكمي في مستوى المياه إلى تغيرات كبيرة أيضا في تضاريس المناطق المجاورة وفي البحر الأبيض المتوسط بما في ذلك تغيرات لا يمكن الرجوع عنها في الجزء الشمالي، من خلق للمجاري، والانسحاب من الشواطئ، والأضرار التي لحقت بالبنية التحتية (الطرق والجسور) والمحميات الطبيعية.\nيُعد البحر الميت مهماً جدًا للصناعة والسياحة في المنطقة، حيث تُعتبر تركيبة مياهه مختلفة عن المياه الطبيعية، باحتوائها على تركيز عالي من الكالسيوم والبوتاسيوم. ويُستغل هذا في مصانع الجانبين الأردني والإسرائيلي. وترجع الأهمية التاريخية والسياحية لمنطقة حوض البحر الميت إلى البحر نفسه وإلى شواطئه، حيث توجد بعض المعالم الأثرية والدينية الهامة في المنطقة مثل مسعدة، وخربة قمران، وكهف النبي لوط، بالإضافة إلى التشكيلات الملحية الطبيعية، والمناخ السائد فيه، فكلها جعلت من البحر الميت نقطة جذب سياحية عالمية، وخصوصًا فيما يتعلق بالسياحة العلاجية. وتحوي المنطقة على آلاف الغرف الفندقية، حيث تتركز في الجزء الشمالي الشرقي في الأردن، بالإضافة إلى الجزء الغربي المطل على الحوض الجنوبي. وقد رُشح ليكون أحد عجائب الدنيا السبع الطبيعية في نطاق البحيرات.\nورغم أن دولة فلسطين لها جزء يطل على البحر الميت إلا أن السلطات الإسرائيلية لا تسمح للفلسطينيين باستغلال مواردهم من البحر، بل تمنعهم تماما من الذهاب إلى ساحل البحر الميت بحجة الأمن. وتشكل حقوق الفلسطينيين في استغلال نصيبهم من البحر الميت نقطة هامة في مباحثات السلام، بالإضافة إلى حقوقهم في مياه الشرب.\n\nالتسمية\nأُطلق على البحر الميت تاريخيّا عدة أسماء قديمة في العهد القديم مثل: «بحر الملح» و«بحر العربة» و«البحر الشرقي» و«عمق السديم». وفي عهد عيسى المسيح عُرف بـ «بحر الموت»، و«بحر سدوم» نسبة إلى منطقة سدوم المجاورة، كما دُعي «البحيرة المنتنة» لأن مياهه وشواطئه لها رائحة منتنة. كما دُعي «بحيرة زغر» نسبة إلى بلدة زُغر التي كانت تقع على شاطئه الجنوبي الشرقي، واُطلق عليه اسم «بحر الزفت» نسبةً إلى قطع الزفت التي كانت تطفو على سطحه في بعض الأحيان وخاصة عند حدوث الزلازل. وقد كان بعض سكان المنطقة يتاجرون في قطع الزفت التي يستخرجونها ويبيعونها. كما ذكره المقدسي في كتابه «أحسن التقاسيم في معرفة الأقاليم» باسم «البحيرة المقلوبة». وقد سُمي أيضًا «بحيرة لوط» نسبةً إلى النبي لوط الذي سكن وقومه بالقرب منه قبل أن يحل بهم العذاب. أما الإغريق فكانوا أول من أطلق عليه اسم «البحر الميت» لعدم وجود حياة فيه.\nوحسب نظرية عالم الإراضة البروفيسور ليو بيكارد كان في الماضي جزءا من بحيرة واسعة حلوة المياه امتدت على منطقة غور الأردن ومرج ابن عامر وصبت في البحر الأبيض المتوسط. وحسب هذه النظرية أسفرت التغييرات في علوّ الأرض قبل مليوني عام تقريباً إلى انقطاع الوصلة بين تلك البحيرة والبحر الأبيض المتوسط، وإلى تضيق البحيرة إلى بحيرة طبريا، نهر الأردن والبحر الميت. فأدى حصر مياه البحر الميت، وتبخر الماء إلى زيادة نسبة الأملاح فيه.\n\nالجغرافيا\nيحد البحر الميت من الشرق جبال محافظة مادبا ومحافظة الكرك في الأردن، ومن الغرب الضفة الغربية وجبال الخليل في فلسطين. أما شمالاً فيحده منخفض البحر الميت ومصب نهر الأردن، ومن الجنوب جرف خنزيرة، الذي يُعتبر بداية وادي عربة. يُعتبر خط التقسيم فيه حدًا فاصلاً بين الأردن وفلسطين تماشيًا مع نهر الأردن في الشمال، ووادي عربة في الجنوب. يقع بين دائرتيّ عرض 31.03 و31.43 شمالاً، وبين خطيّ طول 35.21 و35.35 شرقًا. يبعد عن القدس 24 كم إلى الشرق، وعن عمّان 38 كم إلى الجنوب الغربي. تبلغ مساحته الأصلية حوالي 1000 كم2، إلا أنها تقلّصت خلال الأربع عقود الماضية إلى حوالي 650 كم2. ويبلغ أقصى عرض له 17.5 كم، وأضيق نقطة تقع عند مضيق اللسان بعرض 2 كم، أما أعمق نقطة فيه فتقع على بعد 5 كم جنوب غرب مصب وادي زرقاء ماعين، ويبلغ عمقها 399 م، بينما ينخفض سطحه بحوالي 395 عن سطح البحر المتوسط.\nوتحف الشواطئ الشرقية والغربية للبحر الميت منحدرات عمودية على شكل أبراج صدعية والتي تشكل جزءاً من الشق السوري الأفريقي. إن منحدرات الوادي تتجه إلى أعلى برقة إلى ناحية الشمال في اتجاه نهر الأردن وإلى ناحية الجنوب في اتجاه وادي عربة. ومن الناحية التاريخية فإن البحر الميت يتكون من حوضان: الحوض الرئيسي الشمالي والذي يبلغ عمقه 320 مترًا (في عام 1997) والحوض الجنوبي الضحل والذي منه تراجع البحر الميت منذ عام 1978. والحوضين منقسمان عن طريق شبه جزيرة لسان ومضايق الموت التي لديها تل من الطمي.\n\nالمناخ\nيتمتع البحر الميت بسماء مشمسة على مدار السنة، بالإضافة إلى الهواء الجاف. وتتساقط الأمطار على المنطقة بشكل قليل جداً بأقل من 50 ملم (2 بوصة) بينما يبلغ متوسط درجة الحرارة في الصيف بين 32 و39 درجة مئوية. وتتراوح درجات الحرارة في فصل الشتاء المتوسط بين 20 و23 درجة مئوية. كما تعتبر نسبة الرطوبة منخفضة حيث توازي 35% في معدلها. أما الإشعاعات الشمسية، فلقد دلّت الدراسات على وجود طبقة غنية بالأوزون فوق سطح البحر تصل إلى ارتفاع 25 كيلومتراً، ويقوم الأوزون بالإضافة إلى بخار الماء فوق البحر بعملية ترشيح وفلترة للأشعة الفوق بنفسجية.\nويُعد تركيز الأكسجين في هواء منطقة البحر الميت الأعلى في العالم، بصفته المنطقة الأكثر انخفاضًا. وتصل نسبة الأكسجين فيه إلى 36%، علمًا بأن النسبة العالمية تصل إلى 26%. أما بالنسبة إلى الضغوط الجوي في منطقة البحر الميت، فيترواح بين 796 و799 ملم زئبقي، وبهذا يُعتبر الأعلى في العالم.\n\nالجيولوجيا\nيشكل وادي الأردن جزءاً من الأخدود العظيم (حفرة الانهدام التاريخية) والذي يمتد من تركيا إلى شرق أفريقيا. وقد تشكل نتيجة تغيرات جيولوجية شهدتها القشرة الأرضية منذ ملايين السنين، وقد تشكّل في قلبها البحر الميت الذي كان يمتد في الأصل على طول 360 كلم من العقبة جنوبًا إلى بحيرة طبريا شمالاً. يعتبر وادي الأردن بأرضه الخصبة ومناخه الدافئ، والبحر الميت بمياهه العلاجية، مركز جذب سكاني عبر التاريخ، فقد شهد هذا الوادي العديد من الأقوام والحضارات التي تعود إلى عصور قديمة جدًا. وقد تم الكشف عن أكثر من 200 موقع أثري حتى اليوم، ومعظم هذه المواقع المحيطة بمنطقة البحر الميت تتصل اتصالاً وثيقًا بأحداث ذُكرت في الكتاب المقدس، ومن أهمها كهف النبي لوط.\nوقد أجرى بعض الباحثين الإسرائيليين مسحًا جيولوجيًا لقاع البحر الميت عام 1967، وقالوا: «يبدوا أن قاع البحر الميت الحالي مكون من صخور تكوين أصدم الملحي الذي يقع تحت الحوض الجنوبي للبحر الميت». بمعنى أن هذه الكتلة كانت تحت قرى النبي لوط، وأن تكوين هذه البقعة المنخفضة كما ورد مشابه لتكوين أصدم، بينما المحيط الموجود فيه هو من تكوينات جيولوجية مختلفة عنها، هذا بالإضافة إلى وجود صدوع مستعرضة حول هذه البقعة تؤكد أنها لم تكن أساسًا ضمن التكوين الصخري الموجود فيه، وإنما جاءته من منطقة أخرى، وهذا يؤيد حدوث مثل هذا الانزلاق لهذه الكتلة الصخرية. كما يؤيد صحة هذا الدليل صورة الأقمار الصناعية لقاع البحر الميت، والتي يظهر فيها ست نقاط يُعتقد أنها تجمعات سكانية تمثل قرى النبي لوط، وصورة غواصة بريطانية لنفس المنطقة عام 1957 يظهر فيها أيضًا آثار مساكن وقرى مطموة بالملح.\n\nالتشكل\nيُعتبر البحر الميت ظاهرة طبيعية نادرة الوجود في العالم، فهو بحيرة مغلقة لا تتصل بالبحار الخارجية المجاورة (البحر المتوسط والبحر الأحمر). كما يقع في منطقة كانت جزءاً من الموطن الأصلي للإنسان الأول، ومهبطًا للديانات السماوية الرئيسية، ومكانًا لنشوء الحضارات القديمة، ومعبرًا للحركات التجارية والغزوات العسكرية عبر العصور التاريخية المتتابعة.\n\nيعود بداية التشكل الجيولوجي للبحر الميت إلى أواخر العصر الثلاثي، أي قبل حوالي 3 - 7 مليون سنة. فقد تكوّن على أنقاض البحيرات القديمة التي شغلت الانهدام الأردني حيث يقول علماء الجيولوجيا: أن «بحر تيش» أو Tythas الذي يشغل البحر المتوسط جزءاً من مكانه، كان يغطي أغلب أراضي المنطقة العربية، وبعد انحساره وتراجعه ووصوله إلى الشكل الحالي للبحر المتوسط، بقيت منطقة الغور ممتلئة بالمياه مكونة بحيرة أصدم القديمة التي كانت تتصل بالبحر المتوسط بواسطة مرج بن عامر ثم غور الأردن الأوسط حتى عصر الميوسين. وبعد عصر الميوسين، انقطع اتصال البحيرة الأردنية القديمة (بحيرة ما بعد أصدم) بالبحر المتوسط. وأخذت تنحصر شيئاً فشيئاً نتيجة لارتفاع مستوى التبخر في المنطقة بسبب درجات الحرارة المرتفعة. ويعتقد العلماء بأن البحيرة تعرضت لعملية هبوط ثانية بسبب الضغط الكبير الواقع عليها، بسبب تركز الأملاح في قاعها حتى تكوّن البحر الميت بشكله الحالي والذي يعتبره علماء الجيولوجيا حالة دراسية نادرة الوجود، حيث يقع أطول فالق إزاحي قاري في العالم يصل امتداده إلى أكثر من 1000 كم مصحوب بإزاحة جانبية تبلغ حوالي 105 كم. وقد لفت انهدام البحر الميت بتشكيله الجيولوجي ونشاطه التكتوني انتباه الكثير من العلماء في شتى مجالات علوم الأرض.\nتتميز مياه البحر الميت بشدة ملوحتها التي تصل إلى 340 غم/ لتر في أعماقه، وهي نسبة كبيرة جدًا، إذ تبلغ الملوحة فيه عشرة أضعاف ملوحة البحار والمحيطات. ويختزن البحر الميت في باطنه ثروة هائلة لمجموعة كبيرة من الأملاح قد لا تنضب بسبب ضخامة حجمها ودخولها في الصناعات الحديثة. اختلفت الآراء حول أصل تكون هذه الأملاح، وفيما يلي استعراض لثلاث نظريات تفسر كيفية تكونها:\n\nنظرية ترسيب الأملاح البحرية: وتقول أن هذه الأملاح جاءت من مصدرين هما الترسيب المائي، والترسيب الجوي.\nنظرية تجمع الأملاح التحتية: وتقول أن الأملاح تكونت من مياه نهر الأردن والأودية والينابيع الجانبية التي ترفد البحر الميت مباشرة، فهي تحتوي على كميات هائلة من الأملاح مشابهة لأملاح البحر الميت.\nنظرية الأمطار البركانية: وتقول أن جزءاً من أملاح البحر الميت تكون نتيجة العذاب الذي حل بقوم لوط.\n\nالتركيب الكيمائي\nتُقدر كمية التبخر في مياه البحر الميت بحوالي 1600 ملم في العام. وبحسب الفحوصات التي أُجريت على مياهه فإن عملية التبخر والتغيرات الكيمائية تحدث خلال الأربعين مترٍ العليا، وما دونها فهو ثابت لا يتغير. إذاً تختلف كمية ونوعية الأملاح حسب العمق. وتبلغ الأملاح المذابة 44 مليار و957 مليون طن. ومن هذه الكمية تُقدر المواد التالية بملايين الأطنان: كلوريد المغنيسيوم حوالي 23 ألف مليون طن، ملح الطعام حوالي 12 ألف مليون طن، كلوريد الكالسيوم حوالي 6 الآف مليون طن، كلوريد البوتاسيوم حوالي ألفين مليون طن، بروميد المغنسيوم حوالي 975 مليون طن، كبريتات الكالسيوم حوالي 105 مليون طن، بيكربونات الكالسيوم حوالي 46 مليون طن، وكلوريد الروبيديوم حوالي 12 مليون طن.\nومن الجدير بالذكر، أن هناك مصادر أخرى عملت على زيادرة نسبة الأملاح في البحر الميت كالينابيع الساخنة والمعدنية مثل: ينابيع الزهار الكبريتية، وحمامات زرقاء ماعين، إذ أن التحاليل التي اُُجريت على مياه هذه المصادر دلت على نفس التركيب الكيماوي لمياه البحر الميت، حتى أن التحاليل الكيميائية التي أُجريت لمياه منجم بترول أسدم أظهرت علاقتها بمياه البحر الميت.\nإن قوة تركيز أملاح البحر الميت التي ينفرد بها عن كل بحار العالم الداخلية هي عجيبة في حد ذاتها. ولا يقف الأمر عند هذا الحد، بل أن التركيب الكيماوي لمياه هذا البحر يختلف أيضًا عن غيره من بحار العالم الداخلية الأخرى، فهو يتكون في معظمه من أملاح الكبريتات والكربونات. والغريب في الأمر أيضًا، أن أملاح الكالسيوم تكاد تكون معدومة، إذ أن ذلك لا يحدث لأي بحر داخلي مثل البحر الميت. والأغرب من ذلك كله وجود كمية البروم العالية التي تبلغ 5920 ملغم لكل لتر والتي لا يوجد مثلها في أي بحر معروف، حيث أن كمية البروم في المحيطات تبلغ 290 ملغم/ لتر وفي البحار المالحة 1000 ملغم/ لتر.\n\nالروافد المغذية\nيغذّي البحر الميت بالإضافة إلى نهر الأردن، عدد من الوديان والسيول الممتدة على جانبيه الغربي والشرقي. إذ يبلغ عددها من الجانب الغربي 23 واديًا وسيلاً، فيما يبلغ عددها من الشرق 5 فقط.\nوتبلغ مساحة المجاري المتعلقة بالبحر الميت 40,6 كم2. وتأتي معظم تدفقات المياه إلى البحر الميت من مناطق ذات الكثافة المطرية النسبية لمجرى نهر الأردن إلى الشمال والمنحدرات العمودية للوادي المتصدع لشرق وغرب البحر الميت. وإلى الجنوب، يغطي خط تقسيم مياه وادي عربة المناطق القاحلة للنقب وصحراء الأردن الجنوبية.\n\nمشروع القناة\nيمر مُستوى المياه في هذا البحر التاريخي يتراجع حاليًا بمُعدلات لا تُصدق تاركًا خلفة آلاف الحفر، حيث يوجد حاليًا ما يُقارب 3000 حُفرة على الجانب الغربي ومئات الحُفر على الجانب الشرقي، وذلك بارتفاع شديد في وتيرة تشكل هذه الحُفر بشكل فُجائي، في وقت كان البحر يحتوي فيه على 40 حفرة فقط في العام 1990. الخُبراء في هذه المجال يُشيرون إلى أن مثل هذه الحفر تظهر حاليًا بمُعدّل حُفرة واحدة يوميًا، وأن المخيف فيها هو عدم وجود طريقة بمعرفة مكان أو توقيت ظُهورها. ظهور هذه الحفر متعلق بصورة مباشرة بتعرض البحر الميت للجفاف بمُعدل متر واحد سنويًا، بحيث تنهار الأرض فجأةً وتتشكّل حفر كبيرة أحيانًا مما يُشكل خطرًا على المناطق المُحيطة بالبحر من مزارع وطرقات وحتى أبنية كالفنادق أو المنازل. وتتشكل الحُفر هذه نتيجةً لتفاعُل المياه العذبة القادمة من مياه الأمطار أو بعض الينابيع تحت الأرض بالأملاح الموجودة في الأرض بعد تعرُض مساحات جديدة للتجفيف.\nولإنقاذ البحر الميت من الجفاف، قام الأردن بالتعاون مع كل من السلطة الفلسطينية وإسرائيل بالتخطيط لمشروع اُطلق عليه «قناة البحرين»، وهو مشروع مقترح لشق قناة تربط بين البحر الميت وأحد البحار الـمفتوحة (البحر الأحمر أو البحر الأبيض المتوسط)، مستفيدا من 400 متر الفرق في منسوب المياه بيـن البحار. قد تعوض المياه المتدفقة عبر القناة انخفاض مستوى البحر الميت بسبب تحويل المياه إلى إسرائيل بواسطة سد دغانيا المقام على نقطة الاتصال بين بحيرة طبريا ونهر الأردن. وسحب المياه الحلوة المتدفقة طبيعيًا إلى البحر الميت إلى أجهزة الري الإسرائيلية والفلسطينية والأردنية. بالمقابل، عارض المشروع الكثير من المنظمات البيئية في المنطقة، حيث أشارت عدد من الدراسات أن تدفق حوالي ملياري متر مكعب سنويًا من مياه البحر الأحمر إلى البحر الميت سيحدث تأثيرات بالغة الخطورة على كنوز وثروات البحر الأحمر، حيث مناطق الشعب المرجانية وحدائقها التي لا تقدر بثمن، كما سيغير من تركيبة البحر الميت. من جهة أخرى، يرى نشطاء سياسيون أن للمشروع أبعادًا سياسية وإستراتيجة تضر الأردن والسلطة الفلسطينية، وهي بناء المستوطنات الإسرائيلية، وجلب المزيد من المهاجرين وخلق واقع ديموغرافي جديد في المنطقة وخلق رافد بشري مستمر لقواها العسكرية.\nوقد تم التوقيع رسميًا على اتفاقية بين الأطراف الثلاثة في كانون الأول/ ديسمبر 2013 لمد خط أنابيب ينقل المياه من البحر الأحمر إلى البحر الميت، حيث استمر تداول خطة ربط البحرين الأحمر والميت على مدار عقود وخضعت للعديد من التغيرات، كما أنها كانت مُتضمنة أيضًا في اتفاقية السلام بين إسرائيل والأردن عام 1994. ويشمل المشروع مرحلة أوليّة سيتم خلالها بناء خط أنابيب لنقل المياه طوله 180 كم من محطة تحلية المياه في ميناء العقبة الأردني الموجود على الساحل الشمالي الشرقي للبحر الأحمر إلى البحر الميت.\nويهدف المشروع إلى منع تدهور وانكماش البحر الميت وتوصيل المياه النقية إلى الأردنيين والفلسطينيين والإسرائيليين. ويعاني الأردن خصيصًا مؤخرًا من تداعيات نقص المياه بسبب زيادة عدد السكان في ظل استمرار تدفق اللاجئين من سوريا. وقد أعلن البنك الدولي أن البرنامج التجريبي قابل للتطبيق بتكلفة 10 مليارات دولار أمريكي، لكنه حذر وكذلك المنظمات البيئية من العديد من المخاوف البيئية المتعلقة بالمشروع.\n\nالتاريخ\nنالت منطقة سدوم وعمورة أهمية لاهوتية في كتابات الكثير من الباحثين ما بين الوصف كما في كتابات الرحالة العرب وغيرهم، وإتباع منهجية علمية في الدراسة عند بعض الباحثين ساهمت في تسليط بعض الضوء على حادثة الخسف الشهيرة التي عمت منطقة الحوض الجنوبي للبحر الميت. كما أكد الكثير من العلماء أن مكان الخسف قد تم في مكان الحوض الجنوبي للبحر الميت الحالي، وبأن المدن التي ذكرت في القرآن، والتوراة كانت موجودة في مكان الحوض الجنوبي، وأن الخسف الذي حدث في الألف الثاني قبل الميلاد قد دمّر المدن ومن سكنها. وقد استبعد بعضهم أن البحر الميت قد تكون في تلك الفترة فقد كان موجودا قبل حادثة الخسف. وقد أكدت بعض الدارسات أن البحر الميت قد تشكّل بعد تكون عدة بحيرات سبقت مرحلة البحر الميت الحالي، وأن بعض هذه البحيرات كانت ذات مياه عذبة.\nولقد اتفق العلماء على أن منخفض البحر الميت قد شغله عدة بحيرات سبقت تشكل البحر الميت الحالي وهي بحيرة أصدام، بحيرة السمرة، بحيرة اللسان، وبحيرة دامية، والبحر الميت الحالي.\nفعندما بدأ تشكل منخفض الأغوار، كانت الجبال الشرقية متصلة مع الجبال الغربية. وعندها بدأ منخفض الأغوار بالتشكل بالحركة الأفقية أو العمودية كما أشار العديد من العلماء. ومهما يكن الأمر فقد انفرج منخفض الأغوار على شكل أحواض واسعة لكنها لم تكن عميقة، ويبدو أنه كان متصلا مع البحر المتوسط. ومع توالي عملية الانخفاض انقطع الاتصال ما بين البحر المتوسط ومنخفض البحر الميت. وينقطع بذلك اتصال البحر المتوسط مع الأغوار والذي زوّدها بالمياه فترات زمنية طويلة نسبيا. وأصبح مصدر المياه التي تغذي منطقة الأغوار يعتمد بشكل مباشر على مياه الأمطار.\nوقد تعرضت تلك البحيرات خلال تاريخها الطويل إلى اختلاف من حيث الانخفاض عن مستوى سطح البحر والامتداد الأفقي وملوحة المياه. وكان تعتمد بشكل مباشر على رطوبة الجو ومعدلات الأمطار، حيث كانت تسود المنطقة فترات من الجفاف تليها فترات انتقالية ثم فترات رطبة مما يؤدي إلى جفاف تلك الأجسام المائية أو الامتلاء في الفترات الرطبة. وتشير المصادر الجيولوجية إلى أن بحيرة السمرة نتجت عن فترة رطوبة رافقها ازدياد كبير في معدلات الأمطار وأنها ترافقت مع إحدى العصور الجليدية إلى سادت الأرض وكانت ذات مياه عذبة. أما بحيرة اللسان فقد كانت مياهها عذبة أحيانًا ومالحة في أحيان أخرى حسب رطوبة الجو. وهي أكبر المسطحات المائية التي شغلت منخفض الأغوار حيث وصل طولها إلى 220 كم.\n\nومع نهاية بحيرة اللسان حدثت فترة جفاف قبل 14 ألف سنة، والتي أدت إلى جفاف معظم المسطحات المائية في منطقة الأغوار وهي متطابقة مع آخر عصر جليدي في فترة بحيرة دامية. ومع نهاية بحيرة دامية تشكّل البحر الميت الحالي قبل 11 ألف سنة، وقد كان مستوى سطحه يتعرض إلى تذبذب سببه الظروف الطبيعية الناتجة عن التقلبات المناخية إلى أن تحول التقلب في مستوى سطح البحر الميت إلى عوامل بشرية ناتجة عن تحويل مصادر تغذية البحر الميت بالمياه وأهمها نهر الأردن، وإقامة السدود المائية على الأودية التي ترفد البحر الميت بالمياه حتى انخفضت كمية المياه الواردة إلى البحر الميت من 1200 مليون متر مكعب قبل عام 1960 إلى أقل من 300 مليون متر مكعب في الوقت الراهن.\nوقد وُصف البحر الميت في الكثير من الخرائط والمواقع الدينية اليهودية والمسيحية، حيث تُعد خارطة مادبا الفسيفسائية أهم تلك الخرائط. وهي جزء من أرضية لكنيسة قديمة في مدينة مادبا في الأردن، تعود إلى العصر البيزنطي. وهي أقدم خريطة أصلية للأراضي المقدسة، والتي يعود إنشاؤها إلى سنة 560. توجد اليوم داخل كنيسة القديس جوارجيوس في مدينة مادبا، والتي بُنيت في عام 1896 فوق بقايا الكنيسة البيزنطية. تمتد خريطة مادبا على جزء من أرضية الكنيسة، وتُقدر أبعادها بنحو 15.75 عرضا 5.60 طولا، وتشكل مدينة القدس مركزا لها. وتظهر فيها مواقع في فلسطين والأردن وسوريا ولبنان ومصر.\nوتوجد على شواطئ البحر الميت منطقة تاريخية مهمة، هي خربة قمران، وهي موقع أثري صغير الحجم، يقع على مقربة بضع كيلو مترات جنوبي أريحا في فلسطين. اكتسب شهرته العالمية بسب عثور مخطوطات البحر الميت فيه، وقبل العثور على المخطوطات لم يكن معروفاً إلا عند القليل من علماء الآثار. وكانت أول زيارة للموقع من قبل علماء الآثار في أواخر القرن العشرين. وقد بدأت الحفريات هناك في عام 1950، وكانت عبارة عن تنقيبات تجريبية. وتضم هذه المخطوطات مايزيد على 970 قطعة مخطوطة، بعضها مما سمي لاحقا الكتاب المقدس وبعضها من كُتب لم تكن تعرف أو كانت مفقودة. أول من عثر عليها راعيان من بدو التعامرة المتجولين، كما تم اكتشاف المزيد بين عامي 1947 و1956 في 11 كهفًا في وادي قمران. وقد أثارت المخطوطات اهتمام الباحثين والمختصين بدراسة نص العهد القديم لأنها تعود لما بين القرن الثاني قبل الميلاد والقرن الأول منه.\n\nاستكشاف البحر\nبدأ الاهتمام الغربي باستكشاف نهر الأردن والبحر الميت في أواسط القرن التاسع عشر، وذلك من خلال بعثة أمريكية برئاسة الضابط وليم فرانسيس لنش، الذي زار المنطقة في عام 1848 لأهداف اقتصادية وعلمية ودينية. وتنبع أهمية هذه البعثة من كونها أول بعثة أمريكية ناجحة أرسلت إلى حوض الأردن والبحر الميت، حيث أبدى لنش اهتمامًا واضحًا بالمنطقة، وذلك بدراسة إمكانياتها المائية والمعدنية، كما دعى إلى توطين اليهود في الأردن وفلسطين، قبل أكثر من قرن ونصف.\nلم تكن بعثة لنش البعثة الغربية الأولى إلى منطقة نهر الأردن والبحر الميت، حيث زار الأيرلندي كرستوفر كوستغان وادي الأردن في عام 1835، لكنه مات بعد دخوله البحر الميت. وقبل مجيء لنش بقليل، وتحديداً في عام 1847، زار الإنجليزي توماس مولينكس، من البحرية الملكية البريطانية المنطقة، لاستكشاف البحر الميت، لكنه مات بعد أسبوعين من إتمام مهمته. ويظهر أن لنش كان مدركاً للصعوبات والأخطار التي مر بها سابقوه، لذلك نزل في مدينة عكا على الشاطئ الشمالي لفلسطين في 4 نيسان/ أبريل 1848، حيث أحاط السكان المحليون بالبعثة الأمريكية، وقطع بعدها لنش ورفاقه مسافة 25 ميلاً من شاطئ البحر المتوسط عبر الجليل في خمسة أيام.\n\nبدأ لنش رحلته من بحيرة طبريا عبر نهر الأردن إلى البحر الميت. حيث استغرقت الرحلة ثلاثة شهور (نيسان - حزيران 1848). وبعد وصول لنش للبحر الميت في نيسان 1848، أثّرت طبيعة التربة ومنظرها العام في نفسه سلبًا، على الاهتمامات المستقبية للمنطقة، فالملح الخارج عن البحر الميت مغطيًا الحجارة، وطبيعة النباتات في المنطقة تشكّل نقاطاً لتساؤلات مفيدة. كما رأى أن المساحات المحيطة بوادي الأردن وخاصة على الجانب الشرقي منه كانت جافة وصلبة. وخلال جولة لنش في البحر الميت التي استمرت ثلاثة أسابيع رسم بعض الخرائط لشواطئ البحر، واستكشف المرتفعات المحيطة به.\nمن جانب آخر، اكتشف العلماء مؤخرًا العشرات من ينابيع المياه العذبة على طول ساحل البحر الميت وعلى عمق من 30 - 100 قدم تحت قعر البحر. أهمية هذا الاكتشاف تنبع في فهم أكثر للتوازن البيئي للبحر الميت. وقد وجد العلماء العديد من الحفر كل منها بعرض حوالي 10 أمتار في الجزء السفلي للبحيرة، وهي مغطاة بطبقة رقيقة وغريبة من أنواع بكتيرية جديدة.\n\nأهمية دينية\nارتبط البحر الميت تاريخيّا بقصة قوم لوط التي ذُكرت كثيرًا في الكتب السماوية. ولوط هو ابن أخ النبي إبراهيم. هاجر لوط وإبراهيم من العراق إلى الشام في القرن التاسع عشر قبل الميلاد. وقوم لوط هم من أصل عربي قحطاني أصولهم تعود إلى الجزيرة العربية، سكنوا منطقة جنوب البحر الميت بعد الهجرة العربية الأولى التي خرجت من الجزيرة العربية باتجاه الشمال، وتحديدًا بلاد الشام.\nوكان هؤلاء القوم معروفين بممارسة اللواط. وقد ذكرت الكتب السماوية قصتهم بعد أن سئم لوط منهم ويئس من هدايتهم، فتعرضوا لعذاب أدى إلى تدمير قراهم الخمس عن بكرة أبيها. ووردت قصتهم في القرآن سبعة وعشرين مرة في 14 سورة مختلفة.\nولقد ورد البحر الميت في الإنجيل تحت مُسمّيات مختلفة مثل «بحر الملح» و«بحر العربة» و«البحر الشرقي» وغيرها. كما وردت قصة لوط في التوراة في عدة مواضع من سفر التكوين.\n\nالحياة البرية\nتتميز مناطق غور الأردن (من بحيرة الحولة جنوباً إلى جنوب البحر الميت) عن غيرها بالمناخ شبه المداري وقلة حدوث الصقيع، مما يسمح لنباتات استوائية وشبه استوائية بالنمو. أُدخلت نباتات مثل النخيل والموز والحمضيات. من أمثلة النباتات البرية في هذه المناطق الغاب العملاق في مناطق المجاري المائية والوديان. تتميز منطقة النقب ببعض الأنواع التي تعد امتداداً للغطاء النباتي في إفريقيا. من هذه الأنواع العشار الباسق (باللاتينية: Calotropis procera) وأربعة أنواع من السنط أحدها السنط الملتوي (باللاتينية: Acacia tortilis). وتشتهر منطقة البحر الميت باحتوائها على نمط النباتات الملحي، والذي ينتشر أيضًا حول واحات الأزرق، وغور الأردن. وتختلف نباتات هذه المناطق باختلاف درجة ملوحتها وبالتالي قدرة النبات على تحمل الملوحة. ومن نباتات هذا النمط الغرقد والأثل. كما تحوي المنطقة على نمط الغابات الاستوائي، ومعظم الغطاء النباتي في هذا النمط قد تعرض للتدمير بسبب انتشار الزراعة المكثف. وتعتبر نباتات السدر والطلح من أهم نباتات هذا النمط.\n\nكذلك، توجد أجناس نباتية تتواجد في معظم البيئات الشامية المذكورة أعلاه مثل السوسن الذي ينتشر منه أكثر من ثلاثين نوعًا تتوزع على مختلف مناطق الشام حسب تأقلم كل نوع منها. كذلك ينتشر أكثر من خمسين نوعًا من جنس الثوم (الفصيلة الثومية) وأربعين من القنطريون (الفصيلة النجمية) في مناطق الشام المختلفة من مرعش إلى سيناء. هناك أيضًا أكثر من ستين نوعًا من جنس السيلينة من الفصيلة القرنفلية تنتشر في مختلف المناطق وسبعة وثلاثون نوعا من الأربيان من الفصيلة النجمية. وينتشر أيضًا في هذه المنطقة نبات قتاد البحر الميت، وهو نوع نباتي عشبي من جنس القتاد.\nويقع على الجانبين الشرقي والغربي من البحر الميت عدد من المحميات الطبيعية التي تحوي تنوعًا كبيرًا في الكائنات الحية المختلفة. وتُعد محمية الموجب الممتدة بين محافظة مادبا ومحافظة الكرك في الأردن من أهم تلك المحميات، حيث يعيش فيها العديد من الحيوانات البرية مثل الماعز الجبلي وهو نوع من الماعز، الغزال الجبلي، الذئب، الوبر، والضبع المخططة، والقطط البرية مثل الوشق النادر الوجود في الأردن والنموس وغيرها. كما توجد في المحمية أنواع كثيرة من الطيور بلغ عدد أنواعها أكثر من 150 من بين المحلية والمهاجرة منها الشنار والسفرج والقبرة المتوجة والأبلق الحزين والسوادية والبلبل والغراب المروحي الذنب مثل الرخمة المصرية، وعقاب البادية والعويسق وعقاب بونيللي.\n\nالسكان\nتشير المصادر التاريخية، إلى أن تاريخ الاستيطان البشري في منطقة البحر الميت وتحديدًا الجزء الجنوبي منه يمتد إلى الألف الثالث قبل الميلاد. حيث كان مركزا حضاريًا في الفترة التاريخية من 3300 ق.م إلى 2300 ق م. وقد اُستدل على ذلك من خلال الحفريات التي اُجريت في منطقة غور المزرعة، وتحديدًا باب الذراع، حيث عُثر هنالك على أكبر مقبرة في الشرق القديم والتي يعود تاريخها إلى أقدم من خمسة آلاف عام في العصر البرونزي المبكر. وفي الألف الثاني قبل الميلاد، وتحديدًا في 1900 ق. م. كانت منطقة الحوض الجنوبي تعج بالحضارة، وهي الفترة ذاتها التي عاش فيها لوط حسب معظم المصادر التاريخية. وكان فيها خمسة مدن مزدهرة هي: سدوم، عمورة، زغر، أدمة، وصوبيم. وشهدت في تلك المرحلة خسف ودمار لتلك الحضارات. وقد تم الاستشهاد بما نزل من آيات القرآن، وبعض الكتب المقدسة وأراء الكثير من المفسرين وربط ذلك مع التاريخ الجيولوجي لمنطقة البحر الميت.\nالمجتمع المحلي\n\nيعيش اليوم على الجانب الشرقي من البحر الميت حوالي 70,000 نسمة، يتركز معظمهم في بلدات فيفا وغور الصافي ومدينة البوتاس والكفرين. بالإضافة إلى الآلاف من الذين يعملون في الصناعة والسياحة في محافظتي الكرك ومادبا. يوجد في منطقة غور الصافي نشاط زراعي واسع، حيث يجذب بعض العمالة. ويتركز النشاط السياحي في الجزء الشمالي الشرقي حيث تتركز الفنادق الأردنية. ويعمل في هذا القطاع حوالي 20 ٪ من المشتغلين في تلك المنطقة. كما توظف المصانع الكيماوية حوالي 20 ٪ منهم، أما الباقي فيعمل في قطاع الخدمات. وتخضع المنطقة الشرقية للبحر الميت لسلطة وادي الأردن.\nويشكل لواء الأغوار الجنوبية التابع لمحافظة الكرك الأردنية جزءاً كبيرًا من هذه المنطقة، والذي يتجاوز عدد سكانه المقيمين إقامة دائمة 49,000 نسمة حسب إحصائيات دائرة الأحوال المدنية والجوازاتفي الأردن للعام 2008. وهم يعتمدون على الزراعة بالدرجة الأولى بحكم الطبيعة الجغرافية للمنطقة. ويُقدر عدد العاملين في هذا القطاع بحوالي 60% من السكان ذكورًا وإناثًا. وتعد الصافي من أكبر التجمعات السكانية.\nأما على الجانب الغربي، فيعيش في المنطقة الشمالية الغربية، وتحديدًا بالقرب من أريحا وضواحيها 25,000 نسمة. ويعمل سكان هذه المنطقة بشكل أساسي في الزراعة والخدمات. كما يوجد عدد من المستوطنات الإسرائيلية على هذا الجانب يسكنها حوالي 2,500 نسمة، وتديرها المجالس الإقليمية المحلية، ويبلغ عدد هذه المستوطنات 12 مستوطن وتجمع سكني. هذا بالإضافة إلى البدو الذين يأتون في كل يوم لمنطقة أريحا من عراد والقدس وديمونة وبئر السبع. تشغل السياحة الجزء الأكبر من عمل الموظفين في الجزء الغربي من البحر الميت، حيث يعمل فيها حوالي 5,000 موظف. أما الباقي، فيعملون في الزراعة والخدمات.\n\nالاقتصاد\nبدأ البحر الميت في بدايات القرن العشرين بجذب اهتمام الكيميائيين الذين استنتجوا بدورهم أن البحر يحوي ثروات طبيعية مهولة من البوتاس (كلوريد البوتاسيوم) والبروم. لذا، قامت شركة البوتاس الفلسطينية في عام 1929 بتأسيس أول مصنع ينتج البوتاس في الساحل الشمالي للبحر الميت، حيث كان الإنتاج يتم عبر التبخير الشمسي في المحاليل المائية. وكان يعمل في المصنع عمّال عرب ويهود، حيث كان كواحة سلام في أوقات عصيبة. وفي عام 1934 قامت الشركة بتأسيس مصنعها الثاني في الساحل الجنوبي قرب جبل سدوم، إلا أنها تضررت كثيرًا بفعل أحداث النكبة عام 1948.\nتم إغلاق المصنع الواقع في شمال البحر الميت في الضفة الغربية بعد حرب 1948، وقد تم تفكيكه من قبل عصابة البالماخ الصهيونية قبل انسحابها. كما تمت إعادة تشغيل العمليات في مصنع سدوم بالجنوب في عام 1952، والذي استمر حتى وقتنا الحاضر. لقد استولت إسرائيل على بقايا شركة البوتاس الفلسطينية المحدودة بعد تأسيسها، وقد تم تاسيس شركة أخرى بدلاً عنها مملوكة للدولة في عام 1952 لاستخراج البوتاس وغيره من المعادن من البحر الميت. وقد تمت خصخصة الشركة في عام 1995، وهي مملوكة حاليًا لشركة كيماويات إسرائيل.\nيمتد الساحل الفلسطيني على البحر الميت في الضفة الغربية بحوالي 40 كم، إلا أن الاقتصاد الفلسطيني لا يستفيد من الصناعات الكيماوية في البحر الميت بسبب إجراءات الاحتلال الإسرائيلي والمناطق المغلقة التي فرضتها إسرائيل بعد احتلالها للضفة الغربية عام 1967. وتشير تقديرات البنك الدولي إلى أن صناعة المواد الكيميائية الفلسطينية من البحر الميت يمكن أن تولد 918 مليون دولار للقيمة المضافة سنويًا، أي ما يعادل تقريبا كل مساهمة قطاع الصناعات التحويلية في الأراضي الفلسطينية اليوم. كما تشير تقديرات البنك الدولي إلى أن صناعة السياحة الفلسطينية بالبحر الميت يمكن أن تولد 290 مليون دولار من العائدات سنوياً و2900 فرصة عمل. ومع ذلك، فإن الفلسطينيون لا يستطيعون الحصول على تصاريح البناء للاستثمارات ذات الصلة بالسياحة على البحر الميت بسب إجراءات الاحتلال الإسرائيلي. ويُعتبر البحر الميت ذخرًا إستراتيجيًا للاقتصاد الفلسطيني، لما يحتويه على كميات من الأملاح والمعادن ذات القيمة العالية، والتي تستولي عليها إسرائيل باستخراجها وبيعها، وتمنع أي نشاط اقتصادي فلسطيني في تلك المنطقة. وتُقدر الخسائر السنوية للاقتصاد الفلسطيني نتيجة عدم استغلاله لموارد البحر الميت بنحو 1.1 مليار دولار أي ما يعادل 13.6% من الناتج المحلي الإجمالي.\n\nأما على الجانب الأردني من البحر الميت، فقد تم تأسيس شركة البوتاس العربية في عام 1956، والتي تنتج حوالي مليوني طن من البوتاس سنويًا، بالإضافة إلى كلوريد الصوديوم والبرومين. يقع المصنع في غور الصافي، في لواء الأغوار الجنوبية بمحافظة الكرك. ويجني الأردن من الصناعات المعدنية في البحر الميت حوالي 1.2 مليار دولار (تعدال 4% من الدخل القومي للمملكة). ويقع على الشاطئ الأردني حوالي 5 فنادق كبرى مصنفة كخمسة أو أربعة نجوم، أدخلت عوائد للمملكة في عام 2012 بحوالي 128 مليون دولار. وقد زار بانوراما البحر الميت 12 ألف زائر في عام 2013.\nوقد بدأ الأردن بإنشاء منطقة البحر الميت التنموية على بعد 55 كم من العاصمة عمّان لتقديم الفرص الاستثمارية لتطوير العقارات. تمتد المنطقة على حوالي 40 كم مربع على شواطئ الساحلين الشمالي والشرقي للبحر الميت، وتحيط بها الجبال والتضاريس المنحدرة إلى شرق وادي نهر الأردن إلى الشمال. تتمتع المنطقة ببنى تحتية جيدة، وتتصل مع عمّان من خلال الطريق السريع الرئيسي إضافة إلى أماكن الجذب السياحي. وتتركز الفرص الاستثمارية في قطاع السياحة والفندقة بتطوير فنادق دولية من فئة خدمات أربع وخمس نجوم، وتطوير فنادق من فئة 3 نجوم، والمرافق والمنشآت البيئية والمجمعات السكنية والخدمات المجتمعية والمرافق الترفيهية والمنتجعات والمطاعم ومراكز المؤتمرات والمعارض.\nأما بالنسبة لإسرائيل، فقد أنتجت من المحلول الملحي للبحر الميت في عام 2001، حوالي 1,7 مليون طن من البوتاس، وحوالي 206,000 طن من البرومين، و44,900 طن من الصودا الكاوية، وحوالي 25,000 طن من معادن المغنيسيوم، وكلوريد الصوديوم. وتجني الشركات الإسرائيلية حوالي 3 مليارات دولار سنوياً من بيع معادن البحر الميت (في المقام الأول البوتاس والبروم) وغيرها من المنتجات المستمدة من معادن البحر الميت. وتملك إسرائيل 15 فندقًا على طول ساحل البحر الميت الغربي. وكان لهذه الفنادق عوائد على الاقتصاد الإسرائيلي بلغت في عام 2012 حوالي 291 مليون دولار. معظم تلك الفنادق توجد في الجزء الجنوبي من الساحل الغربي.\n\nالسياحة\nتُعد منطقة البحر الميت من أهم المناطق السياحية للاستشفاء البيئي على مستوى العالم، حيث تتميز بمجموعة من العوامل الطبيعية ما جعلها تحظى بمركز تنافسي في المنطقة في مجال السياحة العلاجية والاستشفاء نظرًا لما يتمتع به من خصائص مناخية فريدة سواءً بخلوّه من الرطوبة، وباحتوائه على عيون كبريتية جعلته مؤهلاً لعلاج العديد من الأمراض وخاصة الجلدية منها، والتي تنتشر بصورة كبيرة، حيث يصل عدد المصابين بها في أوروبا إلى 25 مليون مريض، إضافةً إلى علاج الروماتويد، وبذلك امتلكت منطقة البحر الميت عناصر مهمة للجذب السياحي ليس فقط في سياحة الاستشفاء، ولكن بتميزه أيضًا في سياحة الترفيه والسياحة البيئية. إن اختيار منطقة البحر الميت من خلال منظمة الصحة العالمية كمركز عالمي لعلاج الكثير من الأمراض الجلدية في عام 2011، يدل على أهمية المنطقة في مجال السياحة العلاجية. وتعتمد العديد من الفنادق المقامة على ساحل البحر الميت على تقديم العلاج الطبيعي القائم على الاستفادة من الخصائص الطبيعية المميزة للمنطقة دون استخدام أي أدوية كيماوية على الإطلاق. وتؤكد العديد من الدراسات أن منطقة البحر الميت بامتلاكها هذه المزايا العلاجية يمكنها تحقيق أكبر عائد مادي سياحي للأردن، حيث أن نسبة الإصابة بالأمراض الجلدية يتراوح ما بين 1 : 3% من تعداد السكان.\nكما شهدت سياحة المؤتمرات في البحر الميت تطورًا ملحوظًا خلال الآونة الأخيرة، وأصبحت منطقة البحر الميت تختص بهذا النوع من السياحة، من خلال تنظيم المؤتمرات والندوات واللقاءات على كافة المستويات المحلية والإقليمية والعالمية، حيث تتولى جهات مختصة مهمة تنظيم هذه اللقاءات والمؤتمرات وتوفير خدمات لا تقتصر على الجانب الرسمي للمؤتمر، وإنما تشتمل أيضًا على تقديم الخدمات السياحية والترفيهية للمشاركين. وقد قام الأردن بتأسيس شركة البحر الميت للمؤتمرات والمعارض في عام 2003 بمشاركة مجموعة من المستثمرين الأردنيين والعرب. فكانت باكورة مشاريع هذه الشركة هو إنشاء مركز الملك الحسين بن طلال للمؤتمرات لاستضافة أهم الفعاليات والمؤتمرات الإقليمية والعالمية. ولقد ساهم هذا المشروع في وضع الأردن على الخارطة العالمية لملتقيات رجال الأعمال والاستثمار، حيث استضاف المركز المنتدى الاقتصادي العالمي لأكثر من مرة.\nوينظّم الأردن سنويًا ماراثوناً للركض في البحر الميت بمشاركة الآلاف من المواطنين والسيّاح انطلاقا من عمّان وانتهاءً بشاطئ عمّان السياحي المطل على البحر الميت. ويُقام هذا الحدث لدعم مرضى الدماغ والأعصاب في المملكة.\n\nكما تنتج مختبرات البحر الميت الكثير من مستحضرات التجميل المصنوعة من المعادن المستخرجة من طينه، حيث تتوفر في الأسواق في أنحاء الأردن، أو يمكن طلبها عبر شبكة الإنترنت فيتم تسليمها إلى أي مكان في العالم، لكي يتمكن الزوار من الاستمرار بالتمتع بفوائد البحر الميت، بعد عودتهم إلى ديارهم بفترة طويلة.\nمن جهة أخرى، خصصت الحكومة الإسرائيلية في 2012 مبلغ 220 مليون دولار لما أسمته «تطوير وتأهيل البحر الميت». وستغطي معظم الموازنة تطوير المنطقتين السياحيتين على البحر الميت والمسماتين «تامي زوهر» و«عين بوقيق» وما بينهما، فضلا عن تأهيل ومعالجة المناطق والبنى التحتية التي تضررت أو التي يخيم عليها الخطر. وعند إنجاز المشروع، تتوقع الحكومة الإسرائيلية أن يرتفع عدد الغرف الفندقية المعروضة من 4000 إلى 6500. ويهدف المشروع الإسرائيلي، بشكل أساسي، إلى تحويل البحر الميت إلى أحد المواقع السياحية الرائدة في العالم؛ وهو لا يمس من قريب أو بعيد مشكلة استنزاف المصانع الإسرائيلية للموارد الملحية الطبيعية في البحر، علما بأن المصانع الإسرائيلية تستنزف سنويًا أكثر من 250 مليون متر مكعب من مياه البحر الميت.\n\nفي الثقافة الإنسانية\nعُرف البحر الميت في الكثير من ثقافات وحضارات شعوب المنطقة. وكان الفراعنة أول من التفت إلى أهميته، وتحديدًا الملكة كليوباترا، فهي أول من اكتشف أملاحه وخصائصه الشفائية والعلاجية للبشرة وشدّ العظام والجلد وتنشيط الدورة الدموية ومقاومة التجاعيد. كما كان حمام الطين أحد وصفاتها للجمال، حيث كانت تصنع ذلك الحمام من الطين المأخوذ من البحر الميت، والذي اشتهر باحتوائه بوفرة على المعادن التي تغذي البشرة وتنشطها وتسهم في نعومتها وبريقها.\n\nوقد وُصف البحر الميت في الكثير من اللوحات الفنية العالمية، كلوحة الفنان المجري تيفادار أثناء زيارته لفلسطين عام 1906، حيث ظهرت فيها مدينة القدس ومن خلفها البحر الميت. كما ذُكر البحر في عدد من الأعمال الأدبية، سواءً المحلية أو العالمية. وتُعد قصيدة «حجر كنعاني في البحر الميت» للشاعر الفلسطيني محمود درويش أحد أهم تلك الأعمال الأدبية. من جهة أخرى، تُعد «قصائد البحر الميت» التي كتبها الشاعر الإنجليزي سيمون آرميتاج من الأعمال الأدبية الغربية المهمة في هذا الخصوص. وقد استوحاها من النتائج التي توصل إليها علماء الآثار من مخطوطات البحر الميت، والتي اكتشفها راعي ماعز في عام 1947، كما عكست تجارب الشاعر وتجذرها في حياته الخاصة. وتتكون القصيدة من 11 موشحة، معظمها يتكون من 3 أسطر، ويتكون المقطع الشعري الأخير من مجرد نصف سطر.\n\nانظر أيضًا\nقائمة أماكن حسب انخفاضها تحت مستوى البحر\nالبحيرة المالحة الكبرى\nبحيرة طبريا\nبحيرة الحولة\nبحيرة عسل\nاكتوبوس

          "summary": "البحر الميت هو بحيرة ملحية مغلقة تقع في أخدود وادي الأردن ضمن الشق السوري الأفريقي، على خط الحدود الفاصل بين الأردن وفلسطين التاريخية (الضفة الغربية والداخل المحتل). يشتهر البحر الميت بأنه أخفض نقطة على سطح الكرة الأرضية، حيث بلغ منسوب شاطئه حوالي 400 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر حسب سجلات عام 2013. كما يتميز البحر الميت بشدة ملوحته، إذ تبلغ نسبة الأملاح فيه حوالي 34%، وهي ما تمثل تسعة أضعاف تركيز الأملاح في البحر المتوسط، وواحدة من أعلى نسب الملوحة بالمسطحات المائية في العالم. وقد نتجت هذه الأملاح لأن البحيرة هي وجهة نهائية للمياه التي تصب فيه، حيث أنه لا يوجد أي مخرج لها بعده.\nيصل عرض البحر الميت في أقصى حد إلى 17 كم، بينما يبلغ طوله حوالي 70 كم. وقد بلغت مساحته في عام 2010 حوالي 650 كم2 إذ تقلصت خلال الأربع عقود الماضية بما يزيد عن 35%. كما يلعب المناخ الصحراوي للمنطقة الذي يمتاز بشدة الحرارة والجفاف ومعدلات التبخر العالية دورًا كبيرًا في زيادة تركيز تلك الأملاح فيه.\nلقد عانى منسوب البحر الميت مؤخرًا من التراجع المستمر، حيث يرجع هذا الأمر إلى عدد من الأسباب الرئيسية، كالاستخدام المكثف لمصادر المياه، وأهمها نهر الأردن، وضخ المياه في الحوض الجنوبي، حيث يتكون البحر الميت حاليًا من حوضين؛ شمالي وجنوبي يقسمهما شبه جزيرة اللسان. ونتيجة للانخفاض المستمر لهذا المستوى، تعرض الجزء الجنوبي من البحيرة للجفاف، حيث إنّ الجزء الجنوبي أقل عمقًا من نظيره الشمالي، ويصل ارتفاع منسوب شاطئه إلى 401 متر تحت مستوى سطح البحر. ومع تجفيف الجزء الجنوبي، تم إنشاء برك لتبخير المياه وإنتاج البوتاس والمواد الكيماوية الأخرى مثل المنجنيز والمغنسيوم والبرومين في مصانع البوتاس الإسرائيلية، وشركة البوتاس العربية في الأردن. وتحتاج تلك البرك إلى ضخ كبير من مياه البحر الميت وتبخيرها، مما أثّر تأثيرًا كبيرًا على زيادة انخفاض مستوى سطح البحر.\nلقد بلغ المعدل السنوي لانخفاض مستوى سطح البحر خلال العقد المنصرم بمقدار يعادل الفقدان لمدة سنة كاملة، حيث أصبح المستوى ينخفض حوالي متر واحد كل عام. ولقد زاد هذا المعدل في عام 2012 بشكل واضح، فكان انخفاض مستوى البحر 1.40 متر. وقد أدى الانخفاض التراكمي في مستوى المياه إلى تغيرات كبيرة أيضا في تضاريس المناطق المجاورة وفي البحر الأبيض المتوسط بما في ذلك تغيرات لا يمكن الرجوع عنها في الجزء الشمالي، من خلق للمجاري، والانسحاب من الشواطئ، والأضرار التي لحقت بالبنية التحتية (الطرق والجسور) والمحميات الطبيعية.\nيُعد البحر الميت مهماً جدًا للصناعة والسياحة في المنطقة، حيث تُعتبر تركيبة مياهه مختلفة عن المياه الطبيعية، باحتوائها على تركيز عالي من الكالسيوم والبوتاسيوم. ويُستغل هذا في مصانع الجانبين الأردني والإسرائيلي. وترجع الأهمية التاريخية والسياحية لمنطقة حوض البحر الميت إلى البحر نفسه وإلى شواطئه، حيث توجد بعض المعالم الأثرية والدينية الهامة في المنطقة مثل مسعدة، وخربة قمران، وكهف النبي لوط، بالإضافة إلى التشكيلات الملحية الطبيعية، والمناخ السائد فيه، فكلها جعلت من البحر الميت نقطة جذب سياحية عالمية، وخصوصًا فيما يتعلق بالسياحة العلاجية. وتحوي المنطقة على آلاف الغرف الفندقية، حيث تتركز في الجزء الشمالي الشرقي في الأردن، بالإضافة إلى الجزء الغربي المطل على الحوض الجنوبي. وقد رُشح ليكون أحد عجائب الدنيا السبع الطبيعية في نطاق البحيرات.\nورغم أن دولة فلسطين لها جزء يطل على البحر الميت إلا أن السلطات الإسرائيلية لا تسمح للفلسطينيين باستغلال مواردهم من البحر، بل تمنعهم تماما من الذهاب إلى ساحل البحر الميت بحجة الأمن. وتشكل حقوق الفلسطينيين في استغلال نصيبهم من البحر الميت نقطة هامة في مباحثات السلام، بالإضافة إلى حقوقهم في مياه الشرب.",

          "title": "Kerak Castle",
          "content": "Kerak Castle (Arabic: قلعة الكرك, romanized: Qal'at al-Karak) is a large medieval castle located in al-Karak, Jordan. It is one of the largest castles in the Levant. Construction began in the 1140s, under Pagan and Fulk, King of Jerusalem. The Crusaders called it Crac des Moabites or \"Karak in Moab\", as it is referred to in history books. It was also colloquially referred to as Krak of the Desert.\n\nHistory\nCrusader period\nPagan the Butler was also Lord of Oultrejordain and Kerak Castle became the centre of his power, replacing the weaker castle of Montreal to the south. Because of its position east of the Dead Sea, Kerak Castle was able to control bedouin herders as well as the trade routes from Damascus to Egypt and Mecca. His successors, his nephew Maurice and Philip of Milly, added towers and protected the north and south sides with two deep rock-cut ditches (the southern ditch also serving as a cistern). The most notable Crusader architectural feature surviving is the north wall, into which are built immense arched halls on two levels. These were used for living quarters and stables, but also served as a fighting gallery overlooking the castle approach and for shelter against missiles from siege engines.\nIn 1176 Raynald of Châtillon gained possession of Kerak Castle after marrying Stephanie of Milly, the widow of Humphrey III of Toron (and daughter-in-law of Humphrey II of Toron). From Kerak Castle, Raynald harassed the trade camel trains and even attempted an attack on Mecca itself. In 1183 Saladin besieged the castle in response to Raynald's attacks. The siege took place during the marriage of Humphrey IV of Toron and Isabella I of Jerusalem, and Saladin, after some negotiations and with a chivalrous intent, agreed not to target their chamber while his siege machines attacked the rest of the castle. The siege was eventually relieved by Baldwin IV of Jerusalem.\nSaladin besieged Kerak again in 1184. Saladin attempted to fill the ditches that prevented siege engines from getting in range of the castle wall. However, just like the first siege of Kerak, Saladin and his men left before a reinforcing crusader army could come to the castle's aid. This siege only lasted four weeks.\nThe last siege of the 12th century was led by Sa’d Al-Din, Saladin's nephew, in 1188. Unlike the sieges before it, the Muslim army was not under the threat of crusader reinforcements. The year before Saladin had defeated an outnumbered crusader army at the Battle of Hattin and therefore the crusaders could not gather enough troops to reinforce Kerak. The Muslim army cut off supplies to the castle, and Kerak surrendered several months after. When the castle had fallen, it is believed that it was due to lack of arms, not a lack of food. With the fall of Kerak, the Castle of Montreal, which had been replaced as the centre of the lordship by Kerak, surrendered soon afterward.\n\nAyyubid period\nUnder the Ayyubid Dynasty, Kerak served as the administration centre for all of the regions of Jordan. When Saladin's brother, al-'Adil was awarded control of the castle, he made it the site of one of his treasuries. Kerak would continue to serve as the home of a royal treasury for the remainder of the Ayyubid Dynasty. During some internal conflict by members of the Ayyubid Dynasty in the 1230s and 40s, Kerak was one of the three princedoms that was able to remain independent. The castle was retaken by the Egyptian Sultan al- Salih Ayyub in 1249. Kerak was so important to the Ayyubids that it is recorded that only the governors of Kerak and Damascus were allowed to carry their official correspondences on red paper.\nUnder An-Nasir Dawud, much of the defenses of Kerak were expanded and improved in 1244-45. In 1227, the Sultan of Damascus al-Mu'azzam 'Isa, commissioned the construction of a tunnel that ran from the castle into the town.\n\nMamluk period\nIn 1263, the Mamluk Sultan Baibars enlarged and built a tower on the northwest corner. Under the Mamluks, Kerak continued to remain an important administrative centre. Ibn 'Abd al-Zahir stated that the castle held four ministries: the ministry of the army, the ministry of finance, the ministry of Kerak and the chancery. Due to the castle's importance, it also maintained a significant military force, which under the rule of al-Mughith, contained at least 700 horsemen.\n\nOttoman period\nDuring the Ottoman Empire, it played an important role due to its strategic location on the crossroads between the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt and the region of Syria.\nIn 1834, the leaders of the peasants' revolt in Palestine took refuge in Kerak. Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt besieged the castle, and destroyed much of its fortifications in the process.\nIn 1893, the Ottoman authorities reestablished control over the area by appointing a mutasarrıf (governor) resident in Kerak Castle with a garrison of 1400, including 200 cavalry. Parts of the castle were reused. Some of the destruction that had occurred to the structure was due to locals removing stones containing potassium nitrate (\"saltpetre\"), which is used to make gunpowder. Medieval historian Paul Deschamps studied Crusader castles in the 1920s. Amongst the important research done by Deschamps, in 1929 he and architect François Anus created the first accurate plans of Kerak Castle.\n\nJordan\nOn December 18, 2016, the castle was the site of a terrorist attack. Fourteen people were killed and 34 were injured, the majority being Jordanian security forces and local civilians. A Canadian tourist was also killed.\n\nArchitecture\nType and fortification\nKerak Castle is an example of one of the first castles built by the Franks that used a fortified tower structure and is a notable example of Crusader architecture, a mixture of west European, Byzantine, and Arab designs. Many early Frankish castles that predate Kerak were merely towers built along the crusader states during the early years of crusading. In the second half of the twelfth century, the growing Muslim threat made crusaders update their castle design and prioritize defensive elements.\nWhile Kerak Castle is a large and strong castle, its design is less sophisticated than that of concentric crusader castles like Krak des Chevaliers, and its masonry is comparatively crude. Many of its defenses were destroyed and rebuilt during its conquest by the Ayyubids and Mamluks.\nKerak Castle is a prime example of a spur castle, a castle built on top of a mountain to take advantage of the natural topography, as it is built on the southern end of a plateau surrounded on three sides by steep hills. This had the advantage during a siege of concentrating an attack on only one side of the castle, so the defenders could locate most of their manpower there.\nThe castle also used man-made fortifications, including ditches and thick stone walls. Because Muslim armies started to move with siege weapons such as siege engines, Frankish castles started adapting by building thicker and more solid walls. A \"Byzantine ditch\", a ditch or moat to keep siege engines at a safer distance, was constructed near the castle. There is another ditch near the town which is much deeper but less wide, to the west of the castle (now almost completely filled-in). It also has a glacis, an artificial slope made of steep, slippery masonry at the base of the walls that hindered attackers in their attempt to climb the walls and kept them exposed for longer to the defenders.\n\nStonework\nThe crusaders used rough-shaped volcanic stone to build large walls around the perimeter of the castle. After Sa'd al-Din captured Kerak, the Muslims used limestone from nearby quarries to repair and expand the castle. Both the Muslim and Christian stonework show signs of draft masonry, stone blocks which are smooth on the edges, but the centre portion is left rough and raised.\n\nTowers\nThe castle walls are strengthened with rectangular projecting towers, pointing to the fact that it was one of the earlier castles constructed by crusaders, it was only later on in the crusades that the transition to round towers in the curtain wall was made to help with visibility. At Kerak, the towers are much closer together than at other castles, theoretically to help with visibility problems. The towers were also placed at regular points along the wall; this is called the Byzantine tower structure—the square towers at Kerak are identical to the ones used by the Byzantine empire.\n\nChapel\nA chapel was built on the east side of the castle, about half-way along the length of the curtain wall.\n\nPresent day\nWhile Kerak Castle had historically been used to protect the assets of crusader states in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, today its job is much more mundane. The city bordering on Kerak Castle is home to roughly 170,000 people and is a \"lively tourist destination.\" Many people travel along the ancient King's Highway to stop at Kerak on their way to other tourist sites. in 1985 the World Heritage Committee decided that Kerak should not be an UNESCO site as there were \"more representative examples of crusader castles\". This is in part because the castle is not in the best condition and there are multiple examples of crusader castles in the Transjordan that are in better repair.\nIn December 2016, Kerak was the target of a terrorist attack that left 14 dead, including two civilians and a Canadian citizen. It is said that after clashing with police, the terrorists withdrew into the castle and held civilian hostages. There are not many references to Kerak Castle in popular-culture today, however it did play a large role in the 2005 film Kingdom of Heaven.\nThe nearby Al Karak Archaeology Museum introduces the local history and archaeology of the region around Kerak Castle – the land of Moab – from prehistory until the Islamic era. The history of Crusaders and Muslims at Kerak Castle and town is introduced in detail. Originally located in the castle's Lower Court, the museum moved in 2019 to an historic Ottoman building just outside the castle and facing the main castle wall.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of castles in Jordan\nWu'ayra Castle (li Vaux Moysi), an outpost of Montreal near Petra\n\nNotes\nReferences\n\nKennedy, Hugh (1994).

          "content": "Ajloun Castle (Arabic: قلعة عجلون, romanized: Qalʻat 'Ajloun), medieval name Qalʻat ar-Rabad, is a 12th-century Muslim castle situated in northwestern Jordan. It is placed on a hilltop belonging to the Mount Ajloun district, also known as Jabal Auf after a Bedouin tribe which had captured the area in the 12th century. From its high ground the castle was guarding three wadis which descend towards the Jordan Valley. It was built by the Ayyubids in the 12th century and enlarged by the Mamluks in the 13th.\n\nNames\nThe name Ajloun goes back to a Christian monk who lived on this mountain in the Byzantine period.\nThe castle has been the nucleus of a settlement which has grown to become the present town of Ajloun. The castle's developing faubourg led to its second name, Qalʻat ar-Rabad, \"the castle of the faubourg\" or \"the castle with the suburbs\". This name still resonates in the surname of a large and reputable Christian family owning most of the agricultural lands in the direct vicinity of the castle until this day, the Al-Rabadis.\n\nHistory\nByzantine monastery\nAjloun Castle is located on the site of an old monastery, traces of which were discovered during archaeological excavations. Tradition has it that the name Ajloun goes back to a Byzantine-period monk who lived in the area.\n\n12th-century Ayyubid castle\nPurpose\nIt was rebuilt as a castle in 1184 by Izz al-Din Usama, a general in the army of Saladin. The castle controlled traffic along the road connecting Damascus and Egypt. According to Saladin's historian Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad, the fortress was primarily built in order to help the authorities in Damascus control the Bedouin tribes of the Jabal 'Auf. These enjoyed enough autonomy as to ally themselves to the Crusaders, and had at one point set up a 100-tent camp next to the Hospitaller castle of Belvoir on the opposite side of the Jordan Valley. As such, Ajloun Castle is one of the very few Muslim fortresses built by the Ayyubids to protect their realm against Crusader incursions, which could come from Beisan or Belvoir in the west and from Karak in the south.\nFrom its location, the fortress dominated a wide stretch of the northern Jordan Valley, controlled the three main passages that led to it (Wadi Kufranjah, Wadi Rajeb and Wadi al-Yabis), and protected the communication routes between southern Jordan and Syria. It was built to contain the progress of the Latin Kingdom, which with the Lordship of  Oultrejordain had gained a foothold in Transjordan, and as a retort to the castle of Belvoir a few miles south of the Sea of Galilee. Another major objective of the fortress was to protect the development and control of the iron mines of Ajloun.\n\nOriginal outline\nThe original castle had four corner towers connected by curtain walls and a double gate. Arrow slits were incorporated in the thick walls and it was surrounded by a moat averaging 16 meters (about 52 feet) in width and 12–15 meters (about 40–50 feet) in depth.\n\n13th century: expansion, Mongol destruction, restoration\nAfter Usama's death, the castle was enlarged in AD 1214–1215 by Aibak ibn Abdullah, the Mamluk governor. He added a new tower in the southeast corner and built the gate.\nThe castle lost its military importance after the fall of Karak in AD 1187 to the Ayyubids. In the middle of the 13th century AD, the castle was conceded to Yousef ibn Ayoub, emir of Aleppo and Damascus, who restored the northeastern tower and used the castle as an administrative center.\nIn 1260 AD, the Mongols destroyed sections of the castle, including its battlements. Soon after the victory of the Mamluks over the Mongols at Ain Jalut, Sultan ad-Dhaher Baibars restored the castle and cleared the fosse. The castle was used as a storehouse for crops and provisions. When Izz ad-Din Aibak was appointed governor, he renovated the castle as indicated by an inscription found in the castle's south-western tower.\n\nOttoman period\nDuring the Ottoman period, a contingent of fifty soldiers was set inside the castle. During the first quarter of the 17th century, the Lebanese Druze Prince Fakhr ad-Din al-Ma'ni II used it during his fight against Ahmad ibn Tarbay. He supplied the castle with a contingent and provided provisions and ammunition. In 1812, the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt found the castle inhabited by around forty people.\n\nEarthquakes and restoration\nTwo major destructive earthquakes struck the castle in 1837 and 1927.

          "content": "Montreal (Arabic: مونتريال; Latin: Mons Regalis, Mont Real), or Qal'at ash-Shawbak (قلعة الشوبك) in Arabic, is a castle built by the Crusaders and expanded by the Mamluks, on the eastern side of the Arabah Valley, perched on the side of a rocky, conical mountain, looking out over fruit orchards below. The ruins are located next to the modern town of Shoubak in Jordan.\n\nName\nThe Crusaders, who wrote their chronicles in Medieval Latin, Old French and Occitan, mentioned the castle as Castrum Saboach or Scobach, or as Mons Regalis, Mont Real, and Monreal. The second set of variants translate to 'Royal Castle' or 'King's Castle'.\nThe Arabic name is spelled variously as Shobak, Shawbak, Shaubak, Shubek, etc. The word castle or fortress translates in Arabic to qal'a.\n\nExcavation history\nAs of 1994, the castle had never yet been fully excavated, but as of 2006 it was being investigated by an Italian archaeological team from the University of Florence.\n\nHistory\nThe castle was built in 1115 by Baldwin I of Jerusalem during his expedition to the area when he captured Aqaba on the Red Sea in 1116. Originally called 'Krak de Montreal' or 'Mons Regalis', it was named in honor of the king's own contribution to its construction (Mont Royal). The castle is located on a round hilltop site that is separated from the rest of the plateau of Edom, which along with the Moab formed the core of Oultrejourdain. Despite appearance, the Edom plain was a relatively fertile location, which made the site, along with its strategic importance, highly desirable. The castle was strategically important due to the fact that it also dominated the main passage from Egypt to Syria. This allowed whoever held the castle to tax not only traders, but also those who were on pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina. One of the major disadvantages of the site was the lack of a reliable source of water, an issue that the Crusaders encountered all over the Middle East. This problem was solved by the construction of a tunnel down the hill to two spring-fed cisterns. The tunnel allowed defenders to go and retrieve water without exposing themselves to any attackers.\nIt remained property of the royal family of the Kingdom of Jerusalem until 1142, when it became part of the Lordship of Oultrejordain. At the same time the center of the Lordship was moved to Kerak, a stronger fortress to the north of Montreal. Along with Kerak, the castle owed sixty knights to the kingdom. The first Lord of Oultrejordain was Philip of Nablus. It was held by Philip de Milly, and then passed to Raynald of Châtillon when he married Stephanie de Milly. Raynald used the castle to attack the rich caravans that had previously been allowed to pass unharmed. He also built ships there, then transported them overland to the Red Sea, planning to attack Mecca itself. This was intolerable to the Ayyubid sultan Saladin (Salah al-Din), who invaded the kingdom in 1187. After capturing Jerusalem, later in the year he besieged Montreal. During the siege the defenders are said to have sold their wives and children for food, and to have gone blind from \"lack of salt.\" Because of the hill Saladin was unable to use siege engines, but after almost two years the castle finally fell to his troops in May 1189, after which the defenders' families were returned to them. After its capture, Saladin awarded it to his brother, al-'Adil, who held it until after his brother's death in 1193. During negotiations between the Crusaders and the Ayyubids in 1218-19, the Ayyubids unwillingness to hand back over the ownership of Montreal and Kerak was a major reason the negotiations broke down. In 1261, the Mamluk Sultan Baybars, stormed the castle bringing it under the control of Egypt.\n\nStructure\nLittle remains of the original Crusader fortifications. Although it has never been fully excavated, it is known that there was a set of three walls, which partially remain. The most significant remains of the Crusader portions of the Crusader castle is the remains of a curtain wall that ran inside the later Muslim additions and two chapels. The towers and walls are decorated with carved inscriptions dating from 14th century Mameluke renovations, but the inside is in ruins. The pilgrim Thietmar, who saw the castle in 1217 after the Muslim conquest, referred to it as \"a most excellent fortress, surrounded by triple walls and as strong as any I have ever seen\". The external walls and towers are attributed to the patronage of the Mamluk sultan Lajin.\n\nSee also\nList of castles in Jordan\nWu'ayra Castle (li Vaux Moysi), an outpost of Montreal near Petra\n\nReferences\n\"The Crusades\" by Hans Mayer\n\"The Age of the Crusades: The Near East from the Eleventh Century to 1517\" by Peter Holt\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

          "content": "Qusayr 'Amra or Quseir Amra, sometimes also named Qasr Amra (Arabic: قصر عمرة, romanized: Qaṣr ‘Amrah, lit. 'small qasr of 'Amra'), is the best-known of the desert castles located in present-day eastern Jordan. It was built some time between 723 and 743, by Walid Ibn Yazid, the future Umayyad caliph Walid II, whose dominance of the region was rising at the time. It is considered one of the most important examples of early Islamic art and architecture.\nThe building is actually the remnant of a larger complex that included an actual castle, meant as a royal retreat, without any military function, of which only the foundation remains. What stands today is a small country cabin. The foundation has a simple layout with a rectangular audience hall, hydraulic structures, and a bathhouse. The bathhouse is also one of the oldest surviving remains of a hammam in the historic Muslim world.\nIt is most notable for the frescoes that remain mainly on the ceilings inside, which depict, among others, a group of rulers, hunting scenes, dancing scenes containing nude women, working craftsmen, the recently discovered \"cycle of Jonah\", and, above one bath chamber, the first known representation of heaven on a hemispherical surface, where the mirror-image of the constellations is accompanied by the figures of the zodiac.  This has led to the designation of Qusayr 'Amra as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  \nThat status, and its location along Jordan's major east–west highway, relatively close to Amman, have made it a frequent tourist destination.  A preservation project that began in 2010 involves both removing old maintenance attempts and implementing new ones to support the site better.\n\nLocation and access\nQusayr 'Amra is located on the north side of Jordan's Highway 40, roughly 85 kilometres (53 mi) from Amman and 21 kilometres (13 mi) southwest of Al-Azraq.\nIt is within a large area fenced off in barbed wire. A paved parking lot is located at the southeast corner, just off the road. A small visitor's center collects admission fees. The castle is located in the west of the enclosed area, below a small rise.\n\nDescription\nTraces of stone walls used to enclose the site suggest it was part of a 25-hectare (62-acre) complex; there are remains of a castle which could have temporarily housed a garrison of soldiers.\n\nJust to the southeast of the building is a well, 40 metres (130 ft) deep, and traces of the animal-driven lifting mechanism and a dam have been found as well.\nThe architecture of the reception-hall-cum-bathhouse is identical to that of Hammam al-Sarah, also in Jordan, except the latter was erected using finely-cut limestone ashlars (based on the Late Roman architectural tradition), while Amra's bath was erected using rough masonry held together by gypsum-lime mortar (based on the Sasanian architectural tradition).\nIt is a low building made from limestone and basalt. The northern block, two stories high, features a triple-vaulted ceiling over the main entrance on the east facade. The western wings feature smaller vaults or domes.\n\nHistory\nConstruction\nThe painting of the six kings includes King Roderick of Visgothic Kingdom, whose short reign (710–712) has been taken to date of the image, and possibly the building, to around 710. Therefore, for a long time researchers believed that sitting caliph Walid I was the builder and primary user of Qasr Amra, until doubts arose, making specialists believe that one of two princes who later became caliph themselves, Walid or Yazid, were the more likely candidates for that role. The discovery of an inscription during work in 2012 has allowed for the dating of the structure to the two decades between 723 and 743, when it was commissioned by Walid Ibn Yazid, crown prince under caliph Hisham and his successor during a short reign as caliph in 743–744.\nBoth princes spent long periods of time away from Damascus, the Umayyad capital, before assuming the throne. Walid was known to indulge in the sort of sybaritic activities depicted on the frescoes, particularly sitting on the edge of pools listening to music or poetry. He was once entertained by performers dressed as stars and constellations, suggesting a connection to the sky painting in the caldarium. Yazid's mother was a Persian princess, suggesting a familiarity with that culture, and he too was known for similar pleasure-seeking.\nKey considerations in the placement of the desert castles centered on access and proximity to the ancient routes running north from Arabia to Syria. A major route ran from the Arabian city of Tayma via Wadi Sirhan toward the plain of Balqa in Jordan and accounts for the location of Qusayr 'Amra and other similar fortifications such as Qasr Al-Kharanah and Qasr al-tuba.\n\nRediscovery in 1898\nThe abandoned structure was re-discovered by Alois Musil in 1898, with the frescoes made famous in drawings by the Austrian artist Alphons Leopold Mielich for Musil's book. In the late 1970s a Spanish team restored the frescoes. The castle was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985 under criteria i), iii), and iv) (\"masterpiece of human creative genius\", \"unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition\" and \"an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates a significant stage in human history\").\n\nConservation\nSince 1970, there have been multiple conservation projects undertaken at Qusayr 'Amra to address the state of the structure and the frescoes. The first was carried out by the Archaeological Museum of Madrid and spanned three years from 1971 to 1974. While the project involved some architectural restoration, it focused greatly on restoring the frescoes throughout the bathhouse. The frescoes were cleaned of soot, as well as covered with a layer of shellac to protect the paintings. However, this shellac was more damaging than protective, and was removed during a conservation project in 1996 carried out by the University of Granada. Over the years, the color of the shellac turned and covered the paintings. During and after the removal process, the shellac also caused some of the paint to come off of the wall.\n\nCurrent project\nIn 2010, a new conservation project began and is currently still active. This project has been conducted by the World Monuments Fund, the Italian Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro, and the Department of Antiquities of Jordan. While this project works on the bathhouse itself as well as restoring the frescoes, it makes a point to also focus on the architecture outside of the bathhouse, such as the qasr, saqiya, and watch tower, which have not been conserved, since previous projects focused mainly on the frescoes and interior of the bathhouse. The conservation efforts began with documentation of the state of the paintings, frescoes, and the building. Lime mortar was applied to parts of the structure that were showing signs of leaking water and loss of original mortar. Additionally, windows and ceiling covers were added to prevent water from entering the bathhouse and to protect it from outside conditions. Removal of more shellac and cleaning of the paintings and frescoes revealed rich colors that had not been visible before.\n\nFrescoes\nQusayr 'Amra is most notable for the frescoes on the inside walls. The frescoes are not only appreciated for their artistic value, but also for their role as markers of the birth and evolution of Islamic Art, especially during the Umayyad Period. The frescoes depict a wide variety of scenes including: hunting scenes, bathing scenes, animals, vegetal motifs, mythological figures, and religious scenes.\n\nReception hall\nThe main entry vault has scenes of hunting, fruit and wine consumption, and naked women. Some of the animals shown are not abundant in the region but were more commonly found in Persia, suggesting some influence from that area. One surface depicts the construction of the building. Near the base of one wall a haloed king is shown on a throne. An adjoining section, now in Berlin's Museum of Islamic Art, shows attendants as well as a boat in waters abundant with fish and fowl.\n\nWest Aisle\nThe story of Jonah and the whale is depicted four times in the frescoes of the west aisle; these are the earliest known images of Jonah in Islamic art. It is difficult to tell whether they illustrate the story as told in the Quran or in the Bible, since these two tellings are very similar. The inclusion of amphorae in the frescoes puts them closer to the Biblical version, but this detail could indicate that the artists based their pictures on third-party models rather than working directly from religious texts. In the Quran, Jonah had many roles and was often seen as an example of good and bad behavior as well as a spiritual leader. The inclusion of multiple images of Jonah in the bathhouse alludes to its builder's belief in a predestined right to rule, since Jonah was divinely appointed as a leader. Al-Walid was greatly focused on legitimacy, especially that coming from God, and the connection he made between himself and Jonah enforces this idea.\nOn the north wall of the west aisle, there is a large fresco of a nude woman swimming. In this fresco, there are fish that appear to be swimming around the woman, and a large flower that is understood to be a lotus flower. It is not known who the woman represents, but due to the apparent classical and late Roman style of depicting her, a number of mythological persons have been suggested. Despite this, due to the imagery surrounding the woman, it is believed that this specific fresco depicts a Nilotic scene. There have been a number of visual connections made between the Nile and the River Jordan that could support this claim. The Nile specifically was understood to be a symbol of plenty and a provider of life, and this meaning, which when placed in the context of where in the bathhouse this fresco is located, connects to al-Walid's role as a ruler. Opposite this wall the fresco of al-Walid enthroned sits, and this contrast between the large fresco of al-Walid and the fresco of the woman swimming implies that as caliph, al-Walid saw himself as a provider of life to the people he ruled over.\n\nThrone apse\nAn image known as the \"six kings\" depicts the Umayyad caliph and the rulers of realms near and far. Based on details and inscriptions in the image, four of the depicted kings are identified as the Byzantine Emperor, the Visigothic king Roderic, the Sassanid Persian Shah, and the Negus of Ethiopia. The last one was for a long time unidentified, speculated to be the Turkish, Chinese, or Indian ruler, and now known to represent the emperor of China. Its intent was unclear. The Greek word ΝΙΚΗ nike, meaning victory, was discovered nearby, suggesting that the \"six kings\" image was meant to suggest the caliph's supremacy over his enemies. Another possible interpretation is that the six figures are depicted in supplication, presumably towards the Caliph who would be seated in the hall.\n\nBath\nThe frescoes in all rooms but the caldarium reflect the advice of contemporary Arab physicians. They believed that baths drained the spirits of the bathers, and that to revive \"the three vital principles in the body, the animal, the spiritual and the natural,\" the bath's walls should be covered with pictures of activities like hunting, of lovers, and of gardens and palm trees. There were a variety of themes and patterns throughout the frescos and mosaics. One aspect which can be seen through a majority of these mosaics is a focus on repeating and geometric shapes, colors, and patters. One of the major themes in this palace is water. One examples of this theme of water is a mosaic where the Triumph of the Roman god Neptune. This was the god of the sea and his presence accentuates the theme of water. These themes emphasize the water within the bathhouses.\n\nApodyterium\nThe apodyterium, or changing room, is decorated with scenes of animals engaging in human activities, particularly performing music. One ambiguous image has an angel gazing down on a shrouded human form. It has often been thought to be a death scene, but some other interpretations have suggested the shroud covers a pair of lovers. Three blackened faces on the ceiling have been thought to represent the stages of life. Christians in the area believe the middle figure is Jesus Christ.\n\nTepidarium\nOn the walls and ceiling of the tepidarium, or warm bath, are scenes of plants and trees similar to those in the mosaic at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. Out of the three frescoes depicting women bathing in Qusayr 'Amra, two are located in the tepidarium. These frescoes depict women carrying water buckets to bathe their children, and included imagery of erotes as well. These women are depicted completely in the nude, which was not uncommon since the Umayyads accepted depictions of nudity, and since this building is not a religious one, depictions of humans was also approved. These frescoes have clear Roman influence with not only the inclusion of the erotes, but also the Roman-esque backgrounds and the belief that the scenes depicted could be part of a Dionysiac infant cycle. It is accurate to say that the women depicted were most likely goddesses of some kind since women were not allowed to enter bathhouses. Additionally, men were only allowed to enter if they were covered, which is reflected by the images of men somewhat covered in the bathhouse, so depictions of nudity of women would only be acceptable if the subjects were not human. Since the frescoes only have a few figures, it made it so viewers could focus on them more and on what was happening in the scene. The scene of a woman pouring water over another person's head would have mimicked what occurred in the room and further connects the frescoes to the viewer.\n\nCaldarium\nThe caldarium or hot bath's hemispheric dome has a representation of the heavens in which the zodiac is depicted, among 35 separate identifiable constellations. It is believed to be the earliest image of the night sky painted on anything other than a flat surface. The radii emerge not from the dome's center but, accurately, from the north celestial pole. The angle of the zodiac is depicted accurately as well. Creating the fresco on the dome was technically difficult, however, based on evidence showing that the artist had to redo several parts, it was clear that he was very skilled and focused on accuracy. The only error discernible in the surviving artwork is the counterclockwise order of the stars, which suggests the image was copied from one on a flat surface.\n\nSee also\nHammam (Arabic bathhouse)\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\nList of World Heritage Sites in Jordan\nList of castles in Jordan\n Jordan portal\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nAlois Musil: Ḳuṣejr ʿAmra, Kaiserliche Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien, Wien : k.k.

It was built early in the 8th century (probably between 711 and 715) by the Umayyad caliph Walid I whose dominance of the region was rising at the time. It is considered one of the most important examples of early Islamic art and architecture.\nThe building is the remnant of a larger complex that included an actual castle, of which only the foundation remains.

It is most notable for the frescoes that remain on the ceilings inside, which depict hunting, naked women and, above one bath chamber, an accurate representation of the zodiac. These have led to its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, one of four in the country. That status, and its location along Jordan's major east-west highway, relatively close to Amman, have made it a frequent tourist destination.\n\n## Get in\nPublic transport is scarce. The only way to complete the itinerary is by car or with an organized tour from Amman. In the case of an independent itinerary, it is advisable to mark in advance the GPS position of the individual monuments to be visited and to carefully evaluate the route also in relation to the distances.\nQasr Amra is on the right of Highway 40, about 85 km east of Amman and 15 km from Qasr al-Kharana, still on the same road that leads to Amman.\n\n## Get around\nPlan to have plenty of water and food supplies as many castles are located in desert areas.\nAvoid traveling off-the-beaten-path areas unless you have an off-road vehicle.\n\n## See\nQasr Amra is open May-September 08:00-18:00, and October-April 08:00-16:00.\nIt is a site recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. This recognition comes from the fact that it is a \"unique\" in the Islamic world, since its interior is completely frescoed even though Islam does not allow depictions of people. The total surface of the frescoes is 350 m², and over 250 human and animal figures have been counted.\nAt the time of its construction, which dates back to Walid I (705 - 715 CE), who conceived it as a place of leisure and delights for the Umayyad Caliphs, it had various buildings and was surrounded by lush gardens, thanks to the abundance of water that the area provided. Some archaeologists also attribute to it a role of protection of the caravan route of Azraq, Kharanah and Qasr at-Tubah, and consider this construction as the place where the caliphs could spend periods of leisure and at the same time carry out their political duties. The precious frescoes show an unusual representation of people and environments including a series of kings considered infidels and even a naked woman bathing. This representation is unusual in the Islamic world and this also constitutes the peculiarity and interest of the site. Qasr Amra is among the best preserved Umayyad monuments.\nSimple and elegant in its architectural lines, the building is composed of three round arches that define three naves; the central one ends with a room that most likely served as a throne room; the two lateral naves end with a small apse each, protruding outwards with respect to the central nave that ends in a linear manner, which must have been a small alcove.\nThe entire internal wall surface is covered with frescoes of exceptional historical and artistic value, which were largely restored in the seventies of the twentieth century. The work to safeguard the frescoes is still ongoing by French and Italian scientific expeditions. The paintings were badly damaged after the abandonment of the structure, because attempts were made to destroy them by scraping the walls down to a man's height, and by throwing stones at the wall areas that were too high to be reached by hand; the aim was to eliminate the depictions. Experts say that these paintings are to be attributed to Arab or Syrian artists, in which the very strong influence of Byzantine art is expressed.\nOn the ceiling of the central nave are frescoes depicting rural scenes; on the west wall is the painting of the Six Sovereigns, some of whom have been identified as the Emperor of Byzantium; the Visigoth king Rodrigo; the last Sassanid ruler Chosroe and the Abyssinian Negus, all characters who were enemies of Islam, who are deliberately depicted in an attitude of deference towards the Caliph. Next to it, a female figure reclining on a sofa and surrounded by various characters; then a naked woman emerging from a tub in the hammam. There are also numerous hunting scenes.\nThe frescoes on the vault, which are considered the most interesting as they bear witness to life at the time, depict various trades: quarryman, stonemason, bricklayer, carpenter, blacksmith, in short all the jobs that were used for the construction of this extraordinary building in the desert. The allegories of Victory, Philosophy and Poetry are frescoed next to the windows, indicated by their Greek names.\nIn the Hammam, which extends along half the left side of the building, three rooms can be distinguished: the tepidarium, with a round barrel vault; a second room that served as both a tepidarium and a calidarium and is surmounted by a cross vault; and finally the calidarium . From the second room a series of pipes reached the entire building of the hammam to distribute the hot water; there is a large tub that rests on a double floor, equipped with a cavity that allows the circulation of hot air. The rooms of the hammam also boast cycles of frescoes (a naked woman; three women bathing are the most notable works). The dome of the third room is of great interest for its fresco that represents a celestial map of the northern hemisphere; it features the constellations of the Zodiac and characters from Greco-Roman mythology.\nOutside the building, the remains of the hydraulic system are visible: a wooden wheel powered by a camel drew water from a well which was conveyed into a tank connected to the hammam or to a reserve basin.",

          "content": "Qasr al-Harrana (Arabic: قصر الحرَّانة), sometimes Qasr Harrana, Qasr al-Haranah, Haraneh, Hraneh, Harana, Qasr al-Kharana or Khauranee, is one of the best-known of the desert castles located in present-day eastern Jordan, about 60 kilometres (37 mi) east of Amman and relatively close to the border with Saudi Arabia. It is uncertain when the palace was constructed, but it likely originates from the Umayyad Dynasty. An inscription on an upper wall dates the building to before 710 CE. A Greek or Byzantine house may have existed on the site. The purpose of the building is a subject of debate among scholars. Theories as to the qasr's purpose include a Crusader's castle, a military stronghold, agricultural outpost, and resting place for caravan travelers. The current scholarly consensus is that the building was used as for meeting between local Bedouin leaders.\n\nDescription\nThe qasr is a nearly square building, 35 metres (115 ft) on each side, with three-quarter-round buttresses at the corners, a projecting rounded entrance on the south side with quarter-round buttresses, and half-round buttresses bisecting every other facade. It is made of rough limestone blocks set in a mortar. Decorative courses of flat stones run through the facing.\nOn the inside, the building has 60 rooms on two levels arranged around a central courtyard, with a rainwater pool in the middle. Many of the rooms have small slits for light and ventilation. Some of the rooms are decorated with pilasters, medallions and blind niches finished in plaster.\n\nLocation\nThe palace is located along the Al-Azraq Highway in a remote area of the Jordanian desert, isolated from human settlement. It is located about 65 kilometers (40 miles) east-south-east of Amman, Jordan, the capital city. The castle has an expansive view in all directions — twelve kilometers (7.5 miles) to the south, 30 kilometers (19 miles) to the west, several kilometers to the north, and the horizon is visible to the east. There were no additional buildings on the site.\nIt was built on top of a ridge which overlooks the Wadi al-Kharana. The wadi is the primary source of water for the palace. Simple well systems called thamail (singular thamila), an Arabic word meaning \"a place where water remains\", were used to draw water from the wadi. Thamail are pits dug into the gravel that rests upon the bedrock in the wadi, where they collect water. It is impossible to identify any thamail used during the period of construction or use of the palace, because these pits are periodically washed away by natural floods. However, the thamail in use today were likely comparable to the ones used by those who used the building. There is no evidence of wells or dams being built in order to provide a better water source than the thamail.\n\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the structure remains unclear today. In 1895, Sir John Edward Gray Hill, an English explorer, noted two deep cisterns that had apparently fallen out of use. Unfortunately, he didn't expand on this observation, and no one else has recorded the existence of any water storage apparatus, like dams or irrigation lines, besides thamail in the wadi bed. The small scale of water production and storage means it is unlikely that anyone depended on the building to support large groups, especially for long periods of time. This discounts the theories that the qasr was used as a caravanserai (a resting place for traders), an agricultural outpost, or a palace intended for recreation.\nEarly explorers assumed the palace was used as a military stronghold. This is very unlikely. Besides being unable to withstand a prolonged siege due to limited water supply, there is no evidence of battlements having existed, and the slits in the wall were intended for ventilation, not as arrow slits.\nNot much is known about trade routes in the greater Jordan area in the early Islamic period. It is believed that trade routes ran from Azraq north to Damascus, as well as from Azraq to Hallabat, then to Al-Muwaqqar and Amman. Qasr Kharana is located far from both of these routes, so it is unlikely that it was intended as a service point for caravan traders, since it is not only remote, but had little water to offer. While there were rooms used as stables, there is no evidence of large corral areas which would have been necessary for caravan groups. The building features no baths or decorative mosaics, so it is unlikely that the building was used as a palace for recreation. A possible function of the building is a meeting place for local Bedouin leaders. While it lacked the infrastructure to support long-term stays of large groups, it has stables, plenty of rooms, and a courtyard which would have been conducive to meetings.\n\nBuilding style, layout, techniques\nQasr Kharana combines different regional traditions with the influence of the then-new religion of Islam to create a new style. Syrian building traditions influenced the design of the castle, with Sassanid building techniques applied. The layout follows Syrian houses, themselves influenced by Byzantine and Roman customs. \n\nThe only entrance is on the south wall. On either side of the entrance are two quarter-round buttresses. Through the entrance is a 3.5 by 9.15 meter passageway which leads into the courtyard, which is 12.65 by 12.95 meters. The layout is largely composed of bayts, which are discrete groups of rooms. These bayts consist of rooms which are connected to each other by doorways, but are only connected to other rooms by the courtyard. On the east and west sides of the courtyard are bayts of eight rooms each, and on the north side is a suite of seven rooms. Each suite has a central room from which smaller rooms branch out. Each room that is adjacent to the courtyard has a doorway connecting it to the courtyard. On each side of the entrance passageway are larger halls of about 12.8 by 8 meters. The halls are divided into two areas by pillars and were likely used as stables and storage rooms.\n\nThere are two staircases leading up to the first floor, located at the southwest and southeast corners of the courtyard. Each staircase has two flights of stairs, with small landings halfway up. At the top of each staircase are three doors. One leads to the first floor of the portico, one leading to the rooms, and another to a corridor with stairs which lead up to the roof terrace. The south side of the first floor has two five-room bayts in each corner, with a large central room in between them. The rest of the first floor follows the layout of the ground floor pretty closely, although the rooms are not oriented exactly the same and the dimensions vary slightly from their ground floor counterparts.\nLike Sassanid buildings, the castle's structural system is transverse arches supporting barrel vaults. The site made it necessary to modify those building techniques slightly. The arches are not connected to the carrying wall, instead placed on bearing arms. The overall weight of the structure keeps these elements together. Some newer building materials, such as wooden lintels, were used, allowing the building to be more flexible and resist earthquakes.\nIslamic concepts of public and private were satisfied through the narrow slits offering views to (and from) the outside, larger windows on the inside and the north terrace separating the two apartments. A room on the south side was set aside for prayer.\nThe wall slits could not have been used by archers as they are the wrong height and shape. Instead they served to control dust and light and took advantage of air pressure differentials to cool the rooms, via the Venturi effect.\nThe architectural style and the decoration of the building show influences from Syrian, Parthian, and Sasanian traditions. Some scholars argue that structure was built during the Sasanian occupation of the area in 620s.\n\nHistory\nIn later centuries the castle was abandoned and neglected. It suffered damage from several earthquakes.\nHill published the first known written reference to the qasr in 1896. It is difficult to pin down the exact date of the palace's construction. There were several stages of construction. The first phase includes the entire ground floor and the western side of the first floor. The second phase includes rooms on the southern and eastern sides of the first floor. The third phase, which was not completed, includes the unfinished rooms in the northwest corner of the first floor.\nWhile it is unknown exactly when the structure was first built, we do have a terminus ante quem. In a large room on the west side of the first floor, there is a small inscription which states it was written on November 24, 710 CE. This inscription dates the end of the first phase of construction of the palace.\nThere are three Greek inscriptions, which are illegible. One hints at a military title, and another contains a “V” which may be a Roman numeral. These inscriptions point to the existence of more inscriptions which have since been lost or disfigured. The source of the stones which contain these inscriptions is unclear. While it is possible that there was a building at the site which predated the qasr, the stones may have also originated from markers in the desert. These three inscriptions are not enough evidence to confirm the existence of an earlier building.\nIn 1895, Hill visited the site. He gave a fairly accurate description of the palace, although he misread his compass and said the south entrance was on the east facade. He incorrectly labeled the ventilation slits in the walls to be arrow slits, as would have appeared in a military fortress. Hill identified some of the rooms in the first floor as “chapels with little Norman arches in the upper parts of the rooms, and Christian devices”. This led to his conclusion that the building was a Crusader's castle, “intended to be used as a stronghold and water store between Umm Moghr and Asrak”.\nAlois Musil, a Czech geographer, visited the site in 1898, 1900, and 1901. He was convinced that the building was used as a fortress. In an effort to justify this, he included battlements in his schematic drawings and baselessly claimed that they had been torn down so that their stones could be reused as weapons.\nIn 1922, Antonin Jaussen and Raphaël Savignac published a description of Qasr Harrana in their Mission archéologique En Arabie, which has been praised as a \"scholarly landmark\". In 1946, Nabia Abbott published a full translation and analysis of the inscriptions at Qasr Harrana. This was instrumental, as early explorers had been unable to translate the entire text. Her translation allowed the building to be dated to 710 CE at the latest.\nIn the late 1970s the palace was restored. During the restoration some changes were made. A door in the east wall was closed, and some cement and plaster was used that was inconsistent with the existing material. Stephen Urice wrote his doctoral dissertation on the castle, published as a book, Qasr Kharana in the Transjordan, in 1987 following the restoration.\n\nTourism\nQasr Harrana remains very well preserved, and is open to tourist visitors from 8 am to 6 pm from May to September, and 8 am to 4 pm the rest of the year. The area is fenced off with a visitors' center on the southeast corner, where the main entrance to the castle area is located. A paved driveway leads from the highway to a parking lot large enough for cars and several buses located just south of the entrance. The site is only accessible by one highway, and is not reached by public transportation. The castle is today under the jurisdiction of the Jordanian Department of Antiquities. The kingdom's Ministry of Tourism controls access to the site via the new visitor's center, charging an admission fee of JD 1 (US$1.42) to the site during daylight hours. A Bedouin merchant sells handcrafts and drinks in the parking lot. There is a plaque in Arabic and English near the main entrance. Visitors are free to explore the entire building. There is little data available concerning the number of visitors per year. The site has a 4.3/5 star rating on Google Maps  and a 4/5 star rating on Tripadvisor.\n\nSee also\nList of castles in Jordan\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nArchnet article – Qasr Kharana\n50 Pictures of this sight\nPhotos of Qasr Kharana at the American Center of Research\n\nPhotos of Qasr Kharana at the Manar al-Athar photo archive",

It is one of the desert castles,  located on the outskirts of present-day town of Azraq, roughly 100 km (62 mi) east of Amman.\nIts strategic value came from the nearby Azraq oasis, the only water source in a vast desert region. The name of the fortress and associated town came from the oasis. The settlement was known in antiquity as Basie and the Romans were the first to make military use of the site, and later an early mosque was built in the middle. The fortress did not assume its present form until an extensive renovation and expansion by the Ayyubids in the 13th century, using locally quarried basalt which makes the castle darker than most other buildings in the area.\nLater, it would be used by the Ottoman armies during that empire's hegemony over the region. During the Arab Revolt, T. E. Lawrence based his operations here in 1917–18, an experience he wrote about in his book Seven Pillars of Wisdom. The connection to \"Lawrence of Arabia\" has been one of the castle's major draws for tourists.\n\nArchitecture\nThe castle is constructed of the local black basalt and is a square structure with 80 metre long walls encircling a large central courtyard. In the middle of the courtyard is a small mosque that may date from Umayyad times. At each corner of the outer wall, there is an oblong tower. The main entrance is composed of a single massive hinged slab of granite, which leads to a vestibule where one can see carved into the pavement the remains of a Roman board game.\nAlthough very heavy — 1 ton for each of the leaves of the main gate, 3 tons for single the other — these stone doors can quite easily be moved, thanks to palm tree oil. The unusual choice of stone can be explained by the fact that there is no close source of wood, apart from palm tree wood, which is very soft and unsuitable for building.\n\nHistory\nThe strategic significance of the castle is that it lies in the middle of the Azraq oasis, the only permanent source of fresh water in approximately 12,000 square kilometres (4,600 sq mi) of desert. Several civilizations are known to have occupied the site for its strategic value in this remote and arid desert area.\nThe area was inhabited by the Nabataean people and around 200 CE fell under the control of the Romans. The Romans built a stone structure using the local basalt stone that formed a basis for later constructions on the site, a structure that was equally used by the Byzantine and Umayyad empires.\nQasr al-Azraq underwent its final major stage of building in 1237 CE, when 'Izz ad-Din Aybak, an emir of the Ayyubids, redesigned and fortified it. The fortress in its present form dates to this period.\nIn the 16th century the Ottoman Turks stationed a garrison there, and T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) made the fortress his desert headquarters during the winter of 1917, during the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. His office was in the chamber above the entrance gatehouse. It had an additional advantage in modern warfare: the flat nearby desert was an ideal place to build an airfield.\n\nAccording to Lawrence, \"Azrak lay favourably for us, and the old fort would be convenient headquarters if we made it habitable, no matter how severe the winter.  So I established myself in its southern gate-tower, and set my six Haurani boys...to cover with brushwood, palm-branches, and clay the ancient split stone rafters, which stood open to the sky.\"  Ali ibn el Hussein \"took up his quarters in the south-east corner tower, and made that roof tight.\"  The postern gate was shut each night, \"The door was a poised lab of dressed basalt, a foot thick, turning on pivots of itself, socketed into threshold and lintel.  It took a great effort to start swinging, and at the end went shut with a clang and crash which made tremble the west wall of the old castle.\"\nLawrence wrote of their first night, \"...when there rose a strange, long wailing round the towers outside.  Then the cries came again and again and again, rising slowly in power, till they sobbed round the walls in deep waves to die away choked and miserable.  Lawrence was told, \"...the dogs of the Beni Hillal, the mythical builders of the fort, quested the six towers each night for their dead masters...their ghost-watch kept our ward more closely than arms could have done.\"\n\nToday\nQasr al-Azraq is often included on day trips from Amman to the desert castles, along with Qasr Kharana and Qasr Amra, both east of the capital and reached via Highway 40. Visitors can explore most of the castle, both upstairs and downstairs, except for some sections closed off while the rock is shored up. There is little interpretive material at the moment.\n\nSee also\nDesert castles\nJordanian art\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nPhotos of Azraq Castle at the American Center of Research\nPhotos of Qasr al-Azraq at the Manar al-Athar photo archive",

          "content": "Qasr al-Azraq (en arabe : قَصْرُ ٱلْأَزْرَقِ, « Forteresse bleue ») est une grande forteresse située à environ 100 km à l'est d'Amman, dans l'actuelle Jordanie. Ce château du désert est implanté dans l’oasis d’Azraq, qui bénéficie de sources d’eau pérennes au cœur d’une région aride, et qui contrôle le débouché du Wadi Sirhan, piste d’entrée vers la Syrie des tribus du nord de la péninsule d’Arabie.\nFréquentée depuis l’âge du fer, l’oasis est intégrée dans l’Empire romain en 105, et devient un avant-poste stratégique du système de protection de la frontière de l’est (limes Arabicus). C’est une étape sur la voie stratégique dirigée vers le sud à partir de Bostra, capitale de la province d’Arabie. Les traces d’un premier camp romain visible sur des photographies aériennes ont disparu sous les constructions modernes. Lui a succédé un fort quadrangulaire bâti en pierre volcanique, dont la datation et l’identification antique sont discutées à partir de quelques inscriptions latines fragmentaires. Le Qasr Azraq antique est Amatha selon les études les plus récentes, ou Basienis dans des ouvrages plus anciens. Le fort aurait été construit à l’époque de la Tétrarchie, sous Dioclétien (295-305), ou peut-être plus tôt sous Aurélien (270-275). Il est l’objet de réfections importantes en 333, seule date précisément connue. Déserté à la fin du IVe siècle, le fort est occupé par intermittence durant la période islamique, marquée par des reconstructions en 1237. Située aux marges de l'empire ottoman, l'oasis est une zone d'insécurité. En 1917, Lawrence d'Arabie y établit son quartier général pendant la révolte arabe contre l'empire ottoman. Après la Première Guerre mondiale, l’oasis est intégrée dans le royaume de Transjordanie et repeuplée. Après de brèves reconnaissances superficielles au début du XXe siècle, l'exploration archéologique débute dans les années 1977-1978. La Jordanie postule depuis 2007 pour le classement de l’oasis et des vestiges du fort sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l’UNESCO.\n\nLocalisation et site\nL'oasis d'al Azraq est le point d'eau le plus important du désert qui s'étend à l'est du Jourdain. Située en Jordanie à une centaine de kilomètres d'Amman, elle contrôle l'extrémité nord du wadi Sirhan, longue dépression fermée orientée sud-est nord-ouest qui s'étend sur 300 km de longueur et une dizaine de kilomètres de largeur moyenne. Elle constitue une voie de circulation connue des Nabatéens entre l'antique Dumat Al-Djandal (actuellement Al Jawf en Arabie saoudite) et le sud de la Syrie. Toutefois, en raison de son aridité et de l'espacement de ses puits, le wadi Sirhan n'est pas une route caravanière importante, car la principale voie commerciale passe par Médine ou par la mer Rouge à l'époque nabatéenne, puis, après le Ier siècle, par la route de l'Euphrate jusqu'à Hit et l'oasis de Palmyre. Par contre, la piste du wadi Sirhan présente un intérêt stratégique, comme voie d'entrée possible des tribus incontrôlées du nord du désert d'Arabie, ou comme liaison avec la Babylonie parthe puis sassanide par l'intermédiaire de l'oasis de Dumat.\nLe bassin d'al Azraq est une dépression au sud des terrains basaltiques du Djebel el-Druze et à l'ouest du plateau jordanien. Son altitude la plus faible est de 500 mètres. Le bassin capte les écoulements d'une multitude d'oueds intermittents et ceux de sources pérennes d'une eau de bonne qualité, issue de l'aquifère basaltique, qui font d'al Azraq un lieu privilégié.\n\nArchitecture\nL'archéologue écossais David Kennedy publie en 1982 le plan des vestiges actuels du fort, document repris dans les ouvrages ultérieurs. Malgré les nombreuses reconstructions effectuées au fil des siècles, le plan d'origine est perceptible d'après les soubassements. Dans sa typologie des forts romains en Jordanie, Samuel Thomas Parker le classe parmi les forts de taille moyenne avec des tours en saillie aux angles et intermédiaires. Les casernements sont adossés à la muraille, selon l'architecture militaire dite des « forts à casernements périphériques », en usage à partir de la fin du IIIe siècle comme à Qasr Bshir. D'après la reconstitution du plan romain proposée par Shelagh Gregory, les salles aménagées en écuries au nord ont remplacé des casernements similaires à ceux des sections ouest et sud.\nLe fort romain est construit en blocs de basalte noir local, en une structure presque carrée de 79 × 72 mètres, avec des murs d'environ deux mètres d'épaisseur entourant une grande cour centrale. À chaque angle, une tour rectangulaire (entre 6 × 8 mètres et 6,5 × 9,5 mètres) fait une légère saillie d'un mètre environ par rapport à la muraille, disposition qui apparaît sur d'autres fortifications à la fin du IIIe siècle. La muraille est renforcée par une tour centrée sur le mur nord et deux tours entourant des entrées sur les côtés sud et est. Certaines tours devaient compter trois étages, desservis par des escaliers, et à l'ouest, une grande structure à deux ou trois étages est identifiée à un praetorium (bâtiment administratif) ou aux principia (siège du commandant). L'entrée principale du fort romain était à l'est, au centre de la muraille, encadrée par deux tours en saillie. La cour intérieure offre un espace de 65 × 60 mètres et conserve des traces de fondations non datées. La couverture des bâtiments est soutenue par des arches qui supportent des corbeaux constitués par des barres de basalte, forme d'architecture romaine qui se retrouve couramment dans la région.\n\nLe fort a connu des reconstructions et des aménagements durant la période arabe. Au milieu de la cour se trouve encore une petite mosquée édifiée à une époque indéterminée. Dans une tour à étages ajoutée à l'époque médiévale au centre du mur sud s'ouvre l'entrée moderne du site avec sa porte à deux battants de pierre. Elle est surmontée d'une plaque gravée d'une inscription arabe datant de 1237 et d'une bretèche.\n\nHistoire\nL'importance stratégique du château vient de son implantation au milieu de l'oasis d'Azraq, la seule source permanente d'eau douce du désert environnant, dans un bassin de près de 12 000 km2.\nPlusieurs civilisations ont occupé le site pour sa valeur stratégique dans cette région désertique éloignée et aride. La région a été fréquentée par les Nabatéens, puis est passée sous contrôle de l'Empire romain lors de l'annexion du royaume nabatéen en 105-106 et de sa transformation en province d'Arabie avec Bosra comme capitale.\n\nLes photographies aériennes du fort d'Azraq montrent la trace partiellement visible d'une enceinte aux angles arrondis qui entoure le fort en pierre. La date de construction de ce premier camp est indéterminée. Une inscription vue lors de la Première Guerre mondiale indiquerait la présence d'une garnison de deux légions d'Antoninus Pius, dénomination qui peut se rattacher aux empereurs Antonin le Pieux, Marc-Aurèle, Commode, Caracalla ou Héliogabale, soit une datation peu précise entre 138 et 222. Une borne milliaire, trouvée dans le fort et donc déplacée, date de 210. Deux inscriptions du fortin de Qasr el-Uweinid, dans le secteur de l'oasis d'Azraq, datent de Septime Sévère. Le premier camp d'Azraq pourrait dater de la fin du IIe siècle ou le début du IIIe siècle. Il est abandonné ou détruit à une époque indéterminée, puis reconstruit à la fin du IIIe siècle selon un plan carré plus petit.\nEn 333, le dux d'Orient Flavius Severinus charge le protector Vincentius de reconstruire le fort d'Azraq, qui est en ruines. Les tentatives pour identifier Qasr Azraq dans la Notitia Dignitatum sont infructueuses. Le fort semble avoir été abandonné au milieu du IVe siècle, et seules quelques céramiques indiquent une présence humaine à la fin du IVe siècle. Cette désertion au Ve siècle pourrait s'expliquer par l'attribution de la protection de la frontière orientale de l'empire aux tribus nomades arabes avec le statut de fédérés et à la période de paix relative avec les Perses Sassanides.\nLa région passe sous le contrôle des Omeyyades au VIIe siècle. Selon l'historien médiéval Tabari, le calife omeyyade Al-Walīd II, fuyant une révolte à Damas, transite en 744 par le fort d'Azraq, avant d'être tué près de Palmyre. En 750, la nouvelle dynastie des Abbassides transfère la capitale de Damas à Bagdad, et l'ancienne province d'Arabie perd peu à peu de son importance et sa population, et à part quelques centres urbains, passe aux mains des tribus bédouines.\nQasr al-Azraq connaît son ultime étape de construction en 1237, avec 'Izz ad-Din Aybak, émir mamelouk au service de la dynastie des Ayyoubides, qui réorganise et fortifie cette position stratégique entre la Syrie et l'Égypte. Une inscription en arabe placée au-dessus de l'entrée retrace et date ces interventions.\n\nLa forteresse dans sa forme actuelle remonte à cette période, mais on ignore la date précise d'édification de la mosquée qui occupe la cour du fort. L'oasis d'Azraq est une étape sur la route de pèlerinage de Damas à la Mecque, mais on ignore si le fort fut occupé durant les périodes omeyyade, abbasside et ottomane. Au XIXe siècle, le château, désigné comme Azraq Duruz, est une vague possession des Druzes de Syrie du sud, et est sporadiquement occupé par quelques Arabes sous leur dépendance.\n\nT. E. Lawrence (Lawrence d'Arabie) y établit son quartier général, à l'hiver 1917-1918, pendant la révolte arabe contre l'Empire ottoman. Il installe son bureau dans la chambre au-dessus de la tour de la porte sud et procède à divers aménagements, murant des entrées, installant des emplacements de mitrailleuses au sommet des tours, ouvrant une grande arche dans le rempart et une rampe pour faire rentrer les chameaux dans la cour du fort.\nAprès la Première Guerre mondiale, l'Empire ottoman est démantelé. Le 16 septembre 1922, le Conseil de la Société des Nations agrée la proposition du Royaume-Uni de créer un Émirat de Transjordanie sous mandat britannique, qui inclut l'oasis d'al Azraq. En 1925, des réfugiés druzes venus de Syrie, chassés par la répression de la grande révolte syrienne, repeuplent l'oasis d'al Azraq, tandis que la Royal Air Force y installe une base aérienne. Plusieurs familles druzes s'installent dans le fort, aménageant des pièces et perçant des fenêtres.\n\nRecherches archéologiques et épigraphiques\nPremiers aperçus\nEn 1901, René Dussaud et Frédéric Macler explorent la région et relèvent l'inscription arabe au-dessus de l'entrée du château, qu'ils datent de 634 de l'Hégire soit 1236-1237. Toutefois, les explorations sont limitées, car la menace des tribus nomades incontrôlées rend la région dangereuse.\nEn 1911, les français Antonin Jaussen et Raphaël Savignac explorent la région pour étudier les châteaux arabes et y relever des inscriptions. Ils atteignent Azraq « infesté de moustiques et rendez-vous des écumeurs du désert » et le nord du Wadi Sirhan, surnommé la route des razzias.\nGrâce à la présence britannique, un département d'archéologie de Transjordanie est constitué en 1923, basé à Jerash puis à Amman. L'archéologue O. G. S. Crawford, pionnier de l'archéologie aérienne et intégré dans les services de cartographie de l’Ordnance Survey, récupère en 1929 plusieurs photographies aériennes du château d'Azraq prises en 1922 par un avion de la Royal Air Force. Ces vues montrent le site vierge à l'époque de toute construction moderne. Elles permettent de distinguer la trace partielle de l'enceinte d'un premier fort, entourant le château de pierre, mais aucune trace des structures internes. Cette enceinte aux angles arrondis est similaire à celles des vestiges des camps romains du siège de Massada en 73. Ses dimensions observées sont d'environ 100 × 125 mètres, mais l'emprise complète de ce camp est estimée au double, à 190 × 130 mètres. Les constructions et la voirie autour du fort ont depuis les années 1970 recouvert ces vestiges.\nDe 1938 à 1939, l'archéologue britannique Aurel Stein utilise à son tour les possibilités de l'archéologie aérienne pour repérer les traces du limes romain en Transjordanie, recherches qu'il complète avec des reconnaissances au sol. Il trouve plusieurs inscriptions à al-Azraq, mais ses observations ne sont publiées partiellement qu'en 1982 par David Kennedy.\nEn 1953, le département des Antiquités de Jordanie déclare le château d'Azraq « site de l'héritage culturel ». Toutefois, l'étude du limes romain visible en Jordanie reste longtemps le parent pauvre des recherches archéologiques. En effet, l'archéologue Samuel Thomas Parker constate que de 1948 à 1977, aucune communication écrite n'a été faite sur ce sujet lors des congrès d'étude de la frontière romaine. En 1975, le département des Antiquités de Jordanie fait regrouper les pierres éparses des ruines du Qasr Azraq en empilements carrés sur le périmètre de la cour intérieure, dégageant la vision du site.\nEn l'absence de fouilles approfondies, Samuel Thomas Parker recueille environ 150 tessons de poterie lors d'inspections de surface en 1976. Leur étude montre une présence humaine allant de l'âge du fer à la période ottomane, plus marquée au IIIe siècle et au début du IVe siècle, et un hiatus entre la fin du IVe siècle et le début du VIIe siècle, époque de la conquête arabe.\nDu 15 juillet au 18 août 1978, David Kennedy mène des recherches sur les installations militaires romaines dans le nord-est de la Jordanie, au cours desquelles il travaille pendant deux semaines sur le fort d’Azraq — qu'il qualifie de « site très difficile » —, dresse son plan et examine les inscriptions de trois bornes milliaires stockées dans le fort et deux autres inscriptions déjà connues. Une étude archéologique globale est dirigée par David Kennedy en 1982, tandis qu'à partir de 1977, des fouilles sur le site sont conduites par Ahmad Lash du département d'archéologie jordanien.\n\nL'autel des tétrarques\nPlusieurs inscriptions latines ont été trouvées dans le fort : un fragment d'autel dédié aux tétrarques datant des années 300, trois inscriptions commémorant la restauration du fort à l'époque constantinienne et des bornes milliaires déplacées et regroupées dans un coin du fort.\nLa dédicace de l'autel est en latin, complétée par des lignes en grec :\n\nUne interprétation ancienne de Joviorum en ligne 4 a fait attribuer à tort l'inscription à l'empereur Jovien (363-364). Les pluriels appliqués aux empereurs et aux césars et leur qualification « Ioviorum et Herculiorum », ajoutée dans une graphie différente, désignent soit les premiers tétrarques lors de la période 293-305, soit leurs successeurs en 305-311. Le texte grec, également ajouté postérieurement à la première dédicace, est d'une lecture difficile. Il commence par une adresse « au Soleil Invaincu Phébus ». La ligne 3 nomme un « Héraclius, protector », officier de l'armée d'Orient qui serait le dédicant. La ligne 4 cite « Césars », au pluriel, peut-être les fils de Constantin Ier.\n\nL'inscription de la praetensio\nL'inscription dite de la praetensio a été découverte en 1949, égarée puis retrouvée en 1983. Depuis, elle est exposée dans l'entrée du château d'Azraq. Quoique fragmentaire et ne comportant que la fin d'un texte, elle est riche d'informations qui peuvent dater et situer al Azraq dans le limes romain, car elle liste les unités de l'armée romaine présentes et décrit un itinéraire de plusieurs stations romaines. D'une lecture difficile, sa transcription épigraphique a connu plusieurs versions et corrections successives.\n\nLa première ligne est tronquée par la brisure, qui fait disparaître le haut des lettres. L'adjectif possessif suos (milites suos / militibus suis) renvoie à l'intitulé de l'autorité impériale au début du texte, la suite mentionnait probablement les travaux. Il ne subsiste du texte que les auteurs et la finalité des travaux praetensione colicata.\nLe terme praetensio, dont c'est la seule occurrence trouvée parmi les textes latins connus, pose un problème de compréhension. Thomas Bauzou le considère comme une forme tardive de praetentura et le comprend comme « route militaire reliant des garnisons isolées ». Maurice Lenoir le rapproche de protensio, littéralement « action d'étendre la main », qu'on trouve sur une inscription d'Aquilée pour désigner une opération militaire de protection. Praetensione colicata pourrait donc signifier « pour établir une liaison avec la garnison de la III Cyrenaïque ». Pour Julien Aliquot, le sens du terme serait «action de prendre position», «embuscade».\nLes quatre premières légions citées, XI Claudia, VII Claudia, I Italica et IIII Flavia, sont connues et font partie de l'armée de Mésie sur le bas Danube. Selon Emil Ritterling, la legio I Illyricorum a été créée par l'empereur Aurélien en 272 ou en 273 après sa victoire sur Palmyre. Le papyrus Oxy. 43r la mentionne associée aux quatre unités mésiennes pour des opérations militaires en Égypte en 295, ce qui daterait les travaux d'al Azraq sous l'époque tétrarchique. Cette proposition fait relativement consensus, mais Michel Christol estime plus logique la participation de la I Illyricorum à la campagne d'Aurélien contre Palmyre en 272, et son établissement sur Azraq pour la reprise de contrôle de la frontière de l'Arabie. Inversement, Julien Aliquot se demande si les travaux indiqués ne feraient pas partie du programme de réfections des avant-postes d'Orient, opérés sous Constantin en 333.\nLe fin du texte décrit un itinéraire en quatre étapes, passant par Bostra, Dasianis, répétée en Basienis, Amata et Dumata, avec des distances exprimées en milliers de pas romain, un mille romain équivalant à environ 1,5 km. Le point de départ, Bostra, est la capitale de la province d'Arabie et la base de la III Cyrénaïque, la terminaison Dumata est l'oasis d'el Jowf ou Al Jawf (actuellement en Arabie Saoudite), à l'extrémité du wadi Sirhan. Les spécialistes font le rapprochement entre Dasianis/Basienis et le petit poste de Dia Fenis, mentionné dans la Notitia Dignitatum. Enfin une inscription découverte à 40 km d'Azraq cite un lieu nommé Basie. Selon les épigraphistes, ces quatre variantes désignent un même lieu. Placé entre Bostra et Dumata, Azraq doit être une des deux stations intermédiaires. Selon les distances indiquées, Thomas Bauzou situe Basienis à Umm el-Quttayn et identifie Amata et Azraq, quoique la distance de 208 milles romains (308 km) indiquée entre Amata et Dumata ne corresponde pas avec les 365 km à vol d'oiseau entre al Azraq et el Jowf, à moins de modifier la lecture du chiffre CCVIII en CCLIIII (soit 376 km). De leur côté, Michael P. Speidel et Charles Zuckerman assimilent Dasianis/Basienis à al Azarq. Michel Christol en 2001 et David Kennedy en 2004 citent les deux localisations possibles, sans trancher.\n\nInscriptions sur la restauration du fort\nPlusieurs inscriptions fragmentaires enregistrent des travaux de restauration durant le règne de Constantin Ier, opérés sur le fort « tombant en ruines » (ruina conlapsam) « faute d'entretien » (incuria et neglecta). L'inscription ci-dessous date des années 326-333 d'après la mention des Césars Constantin le Jeune et Constance.\n\n« [Salvo d(omino) n(ostro)] Constantino maxi/[mo victo]re ac triumfatore se/[mp(er) Aug(usto) e]t Constantino et / [Consta]ntio nn(o)bb(ilissimis) Caess(aribus) / [longa in]curia vetustate / [statione]m ruina conlapsam / [refeci i]ussit Fl(avius) Severinus / Traduction« Pour le salut de notre maître Constantin, grand vainqueur et triomphateur, toujours Auguste, et à Constantin et Constance, très nobles Césars, Flavius Sévérinus, perfectissime duc d’Orient, a ordonné que la station tombée en ruines depuis longtemps sous l’effet d’une longue incurie et de la vétusté soit reconstruite… »\nLe fragment ci-dessous fait l'angle supérieur gauche d'un cartouche rectangulaire. Il est daté de Constantin, entre 323 et 333. Publié en 1985, il a été perdu depuis :\n\n« Salvo d(omino) n(ostro) Con[stantino maximo victore] / ac triumfator[e semper Aug(usto) et Constantino] / et Constantio [nobb(ilissimis) Caess(aribus) 3] / [3] tempore [. »\nDeux autres fragments, découverts lors de la mission Inscriptions en Jordanie (2014-2015), viennent compléter l'inscription précédente de la façon suivante :\n\n«  Salvo d(omino) n(ostro) Con[stantino maximo victore] / ac triumfator[e semp(er) Aug(usto) et Constantino] / et Constantio [nobb(ilissimis) Caess(aribus) multo] / [an]te tempore [longa incur]ia vetus/[tate stationem] ruina conlapsam et / [suum praesid]ium (a)edificare iussit / [Fl(avius) Severin]us v(ir) p(erfectissimus) dux Orienti[s cur]ante V[in]/[centio pr]otec(tore) Divinum laterum / [anno Dalm]ati et Zenofili vv(irorum) c(larissimorum) c(onsulum).\nTraduction :\n\n« Pour le salut de notre maître Constantin, grand vainqueur et triomphateur, toujours Auguste, et de Constantin et Constance, très nobles Césars, Flavius Sévérinus, perfectissime duc d’Orient, a ordonné que la station tombée en ruines beaucoup de temps auparavant sous l’effet d’une longue incurie et de la vétusté et son fort soient édifiés par les soins de Vincentius, protecteur des divins compagnons, l’année où Dalmatius et Zénofilus étaient clarissimes consuls. »\nLes travaux sont donc datés de 333 par l'indication des consuls Dalmatius et Zenophilus. Vincentius est connu par une autre inscription qui enregistre en 334 la construction d'un réservoir d'eau dans la station de Basie, voisine d'Azraq.\nLe fragment ci-après est la partie droite d'une grande inscription entourée d'un cartouche en queue-d'aronde. La datation est la même, l'année 333. Le déchiffrement du début de la quatrième ligne est difficile, la lecture initiale AHIA HAM est reformulée par l'épigraphiste allemand Werner Eck en AMATHAM, qui confirme le nom antique de la station d'Azraq.\n\n« [Perpetuae victoriae ddd(ominorum)] nnn(ostrorum) Constantini / [maximi victoris ac trium]fatoris semp(er) Aug(usti) et / [Constantini et Const]anti nobb(ilissimorum) Caess(arum) / [veterem stationem] Amatham olim ne[g]lectam / [et ruina conlapsam] restaurari iussit Fl(avius) Seve/[rinus v(ir) p(erfectissimus) dux Orienti]s curante Vincentio / [protec(tore) anno Dalma]ti et Zenofili vv(irorum) cc(larissimorum) co(n)s(ulum)\nTraduction : « Pour la victoire perpétuelle de nos maîtres Constantin, grand vainqueur et triomphateur, toujours Auguste, Constantin et Constance, très nobles Césars, Flavius Sévérinus, perfectissime duc d’Orient, a ordonné que l’ancienne station d’Amatha, autrefois négligée et tombée en ruines, soit restaurée par les soins de Vincentius, protecteur, l’année où Dalmatius et de Zenofilus étaient clarissimes consuls.  »\n\nAménagements et explorations modernes\nAu XXIe siècle, les équipes archéologiques jordaniennes du Desert Castle Office effectuent des travaux de restauration sur des parties qui menacent ruine, accompagnés d'explorations archéologiques ponctuelles. Une installation de bain est découverte à l’ouest de la cour du château en 2003.\nEn 2006, un inventaire documentaire de l’architecture du château est dressé, pour identifier, numéroter, décrire et photographier chaque partie de gros œuvre (tours, pièces, murs) et chaque élément d’architecture (portes, fenêtres et meurtrières, arches). En 2008, la fouille est menée sur une pièce à l’angle sud-est du château, reconstruite lors de l’installation druze des années 1920. La stratigraphie est réalisée jusqu’au niveau rocheux d’origine, elle permet la récupération de poteries romaines tardives, byzantines, omeyyades, ayyoubides et ottomanes. Par contre, les traces d’occupation nabatéenne ne sont pas significatives et les artefacts de la période omeyyade sont rares. La même année, une section de mur de 22 mètres dans l'angle sud-ouest, qui risquait de s'effondrer, est restaurée par démontage et remontage depuis ses fondations. La tranchée d'exploration des fondations met au jour des poteries romaines tardives et byzantines et des pierres taillées paléolithiques.\n\nQasr Azraq a connu plusieurs phases de construction et de restauration au fil des siècles. Une étude pluridisciplinaire des mortiers présents sur la construction est réalisée en 2017, qui a pour objet d'améliorer la connaissance de la chronologie des bâtiments. Soixante-quatre échantillons ont été prélevés en divers points du fort et de la mosquée au centre de la cour, afin d'avoir une couverture représentative. Ils ont subi des examens macroscopiques complétés d'examens pétrographiques, d'analyses minéralogiques, structurelles et chimiques.\nCertaines typologies établies par les résultats ont été rapprochées de types connus et identifiés sur d'autres sites. Le mortier de chaux mélangé à des granulats d'origine volcanique ronds et bien calibrés correspond à la reconstruction ayyoubide de 1237, c'est le seul mortier que l'on date avec certitude. Les autres types ne peuvent être datés précisément. Le mortier de chaux hydraulique avec un granulat de pouzzolane relève de la technique romaine, mais il s'observe aussi au début de la période omeyyade dans la mosquée de Qasr al Hallabat et des bâtiments de la citadelle d'Amman. Le mortier de gypse et de chaux est une tradition sassanide. Les Sassanides n'ont occupé la région que brièvement vers 610-629, durant la guerre entre Perses et Byzantins, mais leur technique a pu être importée plus tôt dans le monde romain car on constate son emploi à Gerasa. Enfin, le mortier de la mosquée est différent de tous les autres, ce qui signifie que sa construction n'est pas corrélée à la restauration ayyoubide.\n\nTourisme et patrimoine\nFrédéric Imbert constate en 2018 que la Jordanie bénéficie d'une relative stabilité depuis le milieu des années 1970. Le château d'al Azarq est donc accessible aux visites touristiques.\nAzraq est inscrit le 11 mai 2007 par la Jordanie sur sa liste indicative nationale, comme site mixte, combinant l'aspect culturel avec le fort romain puis omeyyade, et l'aspect naturel avec la réserve aquatique de l'oasis. Cette inscription est la première étape pour figurer sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l’UNESCO (cf. Liste du patrimoine mondial en Jordanie).\n\nNotes et références\nNotes\nRéférences\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\n: document utilisé comme source pour la rédaction de cet article.\n\nBulletin de la Société française d'études épigraphiques sur Rome et le monde romain :\nMichel Christol, « À propos de l'inscription d'El Azraq », Cahiers du Centre Gustave Glotz, no 10 (Année 1998),‎ 1999, p. 375-376 (ISSN 1016-9008, lire en ligne). .\nMaurice Lenoir, « À propos de l'inscription d'El Azraq (suite) », Cahiers du Centre Gustave Glotz, no 11 (Année 1999),‎ 2000, p. 358 (ISSN 1016-9008, lire en ligne).\nJulien Aliquot, « Un duc d’Orient en Arabie », Syria, no 93,‎ 2016, p. 157-170 (ISSN 0039-7946, lire en ligne). .\nThomas Bauzou, « La Praetensio de Bostra à Dumata (El-Jowf) », Syria, t. 73, nos 1-4,‎ 1996, p. 23-35 (ISSN 0039-7946, lire en ligne). .\nMichel Christol et Maurice Lenoir, « Qasr El-Azraq et la reconquête de l'Orient par Aurélien », Syria, t. 78,‎ 2001, p. 163-178 (ISSN 0039-7946, lire en ligne). \n(en) O.

          "summary": "Qasr al-Azraq (en arabe : قَصْرُ ٱلْأَزْرَقِ, « Forteresse bleue ») est une grande forteresse située à environ 100 km à l'est d'Amman, dans l'actuelle Jordanie. Ce château du désert est implanté dans l’oasis d’Azraq, qui bénéficie de sources d’eau pérennes au cœur d’une région aride, et qui contrôle le débouché du Wadi Sirhan, piste d’entrée vers la Syrie des tribus du nord de la péninsule d’Arabie.\nFréquentée depuis l’âge du fer, l’oasis est intégrée dans l’Empire romain en 105, et devient un avant-poste stratégique du système de protection de la frontière de l’est (limes Arabicus). C’est une étape sur la voie stratégique dirigée vers le sud à partir de Bostra, capitale de la province d’Arabie. Les traces d’un premier camp romain visible sur des photographies aériennes ont disparu sous les constructions modernes. Lui a succédé un fort quadrangulaire bâti en pierre volcanique, dont la datation et l’identification antique sont discutées à partir de quelques inscriptions latines fragmentaires. Le Qasr Azraq antique est Amatha selon les études les plus récentes, ou Basienis dans des ouvrages plus anciens. Le fort aurait été construit à l’époque de la Tétrarchie, sous Dioclétien (295-305), ou peut-être plus tôt sous Aurélien (270-275). Il est l’objet de réfections importantes en 333, seule date précisément connue. Déserté à la fin du IVe siècle, le fort est occupé par intermittence durant la période islamique, marquée par des reconstructions en 1237. Située aux marges de l'empire ottoman, l'oasis est une zone d'insécurité. En 1917, Lawrence d'Arabie y établit son quartier général pendant la révolte arabe contre l'empire ottoman. Après la Première Guerre mondiale, l’oasis est intégrée dans le royaume de Transjordanie et repeuplée. Après de brèves reconnaissances superficielles au début du XXe siècle, l'exploration archéologique débute dans les années 1977-1978. La Jordanie postule depuis 2007 pour le classement de l’oasis et des vestiges du fort sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l’UNESCO.",

          "content": "The Amman Citadel (Arabic: القلعة, romanized: al-Qal'a, lit. 'the Fortress') on Citadel Hill (Arabic: جبل القلعة, romanized: Jabal al-Qal'a, lit. 'Fortress Mount') is an archaeological site on an L-shaped hill towering over Downtown Amman, in the central part of the capital of Jordan. \nThe Amman Citadel is considered to be among the world's oldest continuously inhabited places. Evidence of inhabitance since the Neolithic period has been found and the hill was fortified during the Bronze Age (1800 BCE). The hill became the capital of the Kingdom of Ammon, sometime after 1200 BCE. It later came under the sway of major powers such as the  Assyrian,  Babylonian, Ptolemaic, Seleucid, Roman, Byzantine, and Umayyad empires. During classical antiquity the city expanded far beyond Citadel Hill, which was given the role of an acropolis. After the Umayyads came a period of decline and for much of the following millennium, the former city became an abandoned pile of ruins only sporadically used by Bedouins and seasonal farmers; this hiatus came to an end in 1878, when the Ottoman Empire resettled displaced Circassian refugees there.\nMost of the structures still visible at the site are from the Roman,  Byzantine, and  Umayyad periods. The major remains at the site are the Temple of Hercules, a Byzantine church, and the Umayyad Palace. The Jordan Archaeological Museum was built on the hill in 1951. While archaeological discoveries have been made at many sites within modern Amman, Citadel Hill still holds particularly high potential. Archaeologists have been working at the site since the 1920s, including Western and Jordanian-led projects, but a great part of the Citadel remains unexcavated.\n\nHistory\nExcavations undertaken since the 1920s by Italian, British, French, Spanish, and Jordanian archaeologists have uncovered signs of human occupation from as far back as the  Middle Bronze Age (1650–1550 BCE) in the form of a tomb that held pottery and scarab seals. \nDuring the Iron Age, the Citadel was home to the Ammonite Kingdom. Several artifacts were discovered confirming its historicity. The Amman Citadel Inscription comes from this period, and is considered to be the oldest known inscription in the Ammonite language, written in the Phoenician alphabet.\nFrom the Hellenistic period, there were not many architectural changes, but pottery provides evidence of occupation. The site became Roman around 30 BCE, and eventually came under Muslim rule in 661 CE. The Citadel declined in importance under Ayyubid rule in the 13th century, but a watchtower was added to the site during this period.\n\nList of main structures\nThe Great Temple of Amman (also inaccurately known as the Temple of Hercules)\nThe Byzantine church\nThe Umayyad Palace complex\nThe Ayyubid watchtower\n\nGreat Temple (\"Temple of Hercules\")\nThe Great Temple, better but inaccurately known as the Temple of Hercules, is thought to be the most significant Roman structure within the Amman Citadel. According to an inscription, the temple was built when Geminius Marcianus was governor of the Province of Arabia (AD 161–166), in the same period as the Roman Theatre (still standing below Citadel Hill).\n\nDescription\nThe temple stood on a podium 43 by 27 m (141 by 88 ft). The temple measured about 30 by 24 m (98 by 79 ft), with an additional outer sanctum of 121 by 72 m (397 by 236 ft). The portico at the front of the temple had six columns c. 13.5 m (45 ft) tall, but there were no columns standing along the sides of the temple, as was the case with some other Roman temples. Some archaeologists interpret the lack of remains of any additional columns as an indication that the temple was probably not finished, and believe the leftover marble was used to build the Byzantine church nearby. The remains of the building and of the statue found near it offer reason to believe that the Amman temple was comparable in size with many of those in ancient Rome.\n\nDeity\nOne of the main excavators of the most recent and very thorough archaeological and reconstruction campaign from the 1990s, Greek archaeologist and classical architect C. Kanellopoulos, writes in one of the resulting official publications that the name Great Temple of Amman should be preferred, as the deity venerated there cannot be securely identified.\nThree years before the publication of Kanellopoulos's book, fellow ACOR chief excavator K. W. Russell wrote in an ACOR newsletter about the discovery of a new fragment of the temple's architrave inscription, which together with fragments discovered in the past made possible a reasonably secure reconstruction of the entire inscription. The reconstruction, produced by Russell and Kanellopoulos, speaks of \"this Herculean sanctuary and festival-place\". Russell corroborates this information with an inscription found in 1905 in another area of Amman, which speaks of a certain city magistrate as \"the constructor of the Heracleion\", or temple of Hercules. This allowed the researchers to identify the Citadel Hill temple with reasonable confidence as being dedicated to Hercules.\nKanellopoulos, however, maintains some doubts, not least due to the fact that the colossal statue whose meager remains have been discovered near the temple, appears to depict a female deity (see below at  Colossal statue). Philadelphia had, in Kanellopoulos's words, two \"dominant gods\", Herakles and Astarte - one male and one female. The excavation report published by Russell together with fellow archaeologists Anthi Koutsoukou, Mohammad Najjar, and Ahmed Momani in 1997, i.e. six years after the discovery of the additional inscribed architrave fragment, is still cautiously titled The Great Temple of Amman: The Excavations.\nDuring the 1990s digs, possibly cultic features along with six votive figurines were discovered underneath the Roman temple area, which might indicate that the site had been used for religious purposes during the Iron Age. It has also been noted that Herakles/Hercules was the  interpretatio graeca of the Semitic god Melqart of the Tyreans, the better known Herakles-Melqart cult allowing to extrapolate on a similar synchretism between Herakles and Milkom, the supreme god of the Ammonites, still worshipped in Roman times in Ammonitis. A Milkom inscription dating to the Iron Age was found on Citadel Hill, allowing for justified speculations on a succession of local cults, progressing from Milkom to Herakles.\n\nColossal statue\nThe site also contains marble fragments of a colossal, partly stone-made statue, estimated to have been around 13 m (42 ft) tall. All that remains are three fingers and an elbow. The statue was probably destroyed in an earthquake.\nWho was the statue depicting? Some identify it as representing Hercules, but C. Kanellopoulos writes that while the hand fragment (three fingers) and the elbow fragment look in every respect as being part of the same statue, the muscular structure around the elbow excludes the statue from depicting Herakles (the Greek iteration of Hercules), and the slender fingers and the fingernails look feminine. He reconstructs the statue as depicting a woman, most likely a female goddess, with the right hand raised and the left one relaxed, in a pose known from certain depictions of Athena. He notes that there were three female deity worshipped in Philadelphia: Athena, Astarte and Demetra, adding a fourth option, Tyche, who is depicted on local coinage in the style of Athena Hephaisteia (an  Athenian iteration of the goddess associated with the Temple of Hephaestus, famously depicted by Alcamenes). Kanellopoulos describes Herakles and Astarte as being Philadelphia's \"dominant gods\".\n\nAyyubid watch tower\nThe Ayyubid watch tower is a stone tower dating back to the Ayyubid period (c. 1170-1250), more specifically in the year 1220. It is located on the southern wall of the Amman Citadel in the center of the Jordanian capital, Amman, adjacent to the Great Temple. It also contains traces of other civilizations that have succeeded in the city for thousands of years. \n\nIt was constructed by the Ayyubids for observation, as it overlooks the center of Amman. It consists of a small room of 9.45 m in length and 7.55 m in width. There are openings in three of its walls for shooting arrows. The fourth wall has, built into its width, a staircase leading to the roof. Blocks of cylindrical columns, which used to be a part of the Roman Great Temple (\"Temple of Hercules\"), were used on the southern façade.\nThe remains of the watch tower on Citadel Hill were initially attributed to the Crusaders, but are now preferentially dated to the Ayyubid period, leaving it to further research to find the location of the Crusader castle. The Jordanian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities restored the building in the early 1990s.\n\nByzantine church\nThe Byzantine church, built in the 6th century during the Byzantine era, is a ruined ancient church next to the Umayyad Palace. The church was built with a basilica-like layout with a central nave with two-sided aisles, typical early Christian architectural design. A section for formal ceremonies is located at the eastern end. Corinthian capitals are used along with acanthus leaves repurposed from the nearby Temple of Hercules. Flagstones were used to pave the church aisles. At the end of the aisles, rectangular rooms exists which were probably added during the Umayyad period. The church most likely was improved and modified over time. Byzantine craftsmanship can be observed in the preserved mosaic floor in the central nave. The church also represents a confluence of Byzantine and early Islamic periods.\nThe site was originally discovered and partially excavated by C.R. Conder, a British explorer, in 1881. Later, in the 1990s, further excavations and restorations took place. Recovered artifacts were put on display in Darat al Funun's library. Some of the inscriptions found name the Roman god Herakles, the Christian martyr Saint George, and Islamic figure Al Khadr.\n\nUmayyad palace complex\nA palace structure (al-Qasr القصر in Arabic) was built by the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724-743). It is positioned at the northern section of the upper level of the Citadel. It is believed that the palace served as an administrative building or the residence of an Umayyad official. The complex contains an audience hall, four assembly rooms, and a colonnaded road. The palace architecture blends Byzantine, Sassanian, and distinct Islamic styles.\nFollowing the Abbasid revolution, the Umayyad palace went through a phase of progressive decay throughout the Abbasid (750-969) and Fatimid (969-1071) periods.\n\nMosque\nThe Umayyad mosque is south of the Umayyad palace. It is an example of early mosques that imitated the Persian-style apadana hall, characterized by a \"forest of columns\"; these mosques are normally found only in Persia and Mesopotamia (Iraq).\n\nCistern\nAdjacent to the palace is a large water cistern which supplied water to the baths, latrines, and other areas of the complex.\n\nJordan Archaeological Museum\nThe Amman Citadel is also the site of the Jordan Archaeological Museum, the former national archaeological museum established in 1951, which is home to an exquisite collection of artifacts from all the significant periods and regions of the country known at the time and discovered in the following decades dating from prehistoric times up to the 15th century, including the Citadel. Its prominent role has been somewhat diminished since the inauguration of the new national museum in 2014, the Jordan Museum, to which some of the artifacts previously displayed at the Citadel Hill venue have been moved.\nThe collections are arranged in chronological order and include items of everyday life such as flint, glass, metal and pottery objects, as well as more artistic items such as jewelry and statues. Highlights of the museum collections include some of the ʿAin Ghazal statues, which are among oldest statues ever made, and plastered human skulls from Jericho. The museum also includes a coin collection.\n\nHistory\nThe museum was established in 1951 on top of Amman's Citadel Hill, among the remains of the Citadel in the heart of the city.\nThe museum formerly housed some of the Dead Sea Scrolls, including the only Copper scroll, which are now on display in the more recently established Jordan Museum, along with some of the Ain Ghazal statues.\n\nLocation\nThe museum is located in the Amman Citadel in Amman, one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world. Two historic sites are nearby on top of the hill, the Roman Temple of Hercules that dates back to the 2nd century, and an Umayyad palace that dates back to the 8th century. Prior to 1967, the museum had a branch in East Jerusalem.\n\nTime periods represented\nThe collections of the museum belong to the following periods:\n\nPaleolithic period: 1,000,000–10,000 years ago\nNeolithic period: 12,000 years ago up to the Bronze Age and Iron Age\nPre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN): 8,300–5,500 BC, the most famous artifacts that belong to this period being the Ain Ghazal statues.\nPottery Neolithic (PN): 5,500–4,300 BC\nChalcolithic:  4,300–3,300 BC\nBronze Age\nEarly Bronze Age: 3,300–1,900 BC\nMiddle Bronze Age: 1,900–1,550 BC\nLate Bronze Age: 1,550–1,200 BC\nIron Age: 1,200–550 BC\nPersian period: c. 550–332 BC\nHellenistic period: c. 332–63 BC\nNabatean period\nRoman period\nByzantine period\nRashidun period\nUmayyad period\nAbbasid period\nCrusader/Ayyubid period\n\nTourism\nStarting in 1995–96, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Jordan in partnership with American (USAID) and Spanish institutions (AECID and CSIC) began several projects to conserve and restore this site to benefit tourists and the local community.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nCited bibliography\nKanellopoulos, Chrysanthos (1994).

          "title": "Dana Biosphere Reserve",
          "content": "The Dana Biosphere Reserve (Arabic: محمية ضانا للمحيط الحيوي) is Jordan's largest nature reserve, located in south-central Jordan. Dana Biosphere Reserve was founded in 1989 in the area in and around the Dana village and Wadi Dana comprising 308 square kilometres (119 sq mi).\n\nHuman presence\nThe people of the Ata'ta (or Al Atata In Arabic (العطاعطة أو العطاطة)) tribe are the native inhabitants of Dana Biosphere Reserve. Their history in Dana dates 400 years, with human settlement in the area dating back more than 6000 years. Besides the presence of the Ata'ta people, archeological discoveries suggest Palaeolithic, Egyptian, Nabataean, and Roman settlement in Dana.\n\nAccommodations\nVisitors to Dana Nature Reserve and Dana village can stay at Dana Cooperative Hotel and other accommodations.\n\nGeography\nDana Biosphere Reserve drops from an altitude of 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) on the Qadisiyah plateau to the low-lying desert area of Wadi Araba. The varied geology of Dana contains limestone, sandstone, and granite. The area of Wadi Dana features wind-cut sandstone cliffs. Dana is the only nature reserve in Jordan that crosses four bio-geographical zones; Mediterranean, Irano-Turanian, Saharo-Arabian, and Sudanian penetration.\n\nGeology\nDana's unique landscape is formed by an outcrop (exposed bedrock) of fluvial sandstone, dating back to the Paleozoic and Lower Cretaceous. It is also covered by shallow marine carbonate rocks from the Upper Cretaceous and the Tertiary period. The area around Dana is further characterized by a horst, the Dana Horst, formed by two faults running from east to west, which are the Salawan Fault and the Dana Fault. The horst contains Precambrian granitoids and volcanic rocks in contact with Cretaceous rocks. The origin of this basaltic formation is believed to be from two distinct volcanic eruptions: the first dating back to somewhere between the Miocene and Pleistocene, while the second is a highly recent eruption of the nearby Jabal al-Qadisiyah.\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe diverse environment of Dana is home to 703 plant species, 215 species of birds, and 38 species of mammals.\n\nPlants\nDana is the most diverse area of plant life in the country, consisting of numerous vegetation types including: Phoenician juniper, evergreen oak, sand dunes, acacia, and rocky sudanian. Dana is the southernmost area in the world to host the Mediterranean cypress, Cupressus sempervirens. Of the hundreds of plants species inhabiting Dana, three can be found nowhere else in the world. Many plants, especially trees and shrubs, grow in the highlands of the nature reserve.\n\nEndangered species\nThe threatened Nubian ibex, Syrian serin, caracal, and lesser kestrel are natives of Wadi Dana and plans to save the species were put forth by Global Environment Fund in 1994. Additionally, the largest breeding colony of the Syrian serin is in Dana Nature Reserve. Threats to the animals include hunting.\n\nWater and tourism\nOn 26 May, 2025, Prime Minister Jaafar Hassan underscored Tafilah’s rich yet underdeveloped tourism potential, highlighting landmarks such as the Dana Biosphere Reserve and the ancient village of Sela. He emphasized that unlocking this potential requires inclusive, community-driven development planning to ensure local engagement and sustainability. As part of a broader national strategy, a JD25 million investment will be directed toward improving Tafilah’s water infrastructure between 2025 and 2027, while additional large-scale projects in sectors like energy, transport, and housing aim to stimulate economic growth and create jobs.\n\nSee also\nMujib Nature Reserve\nAzraq Wetland Reserve\nList of nature reserves in Jordan\n Jordan portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nDana from the American center of oriental research.\nDana Biosphere Reserve\nDana Community Cooperative\nThe Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature\nDana Cooperative Hotel",

          "content": "The Wadi Mujib (Arabic: وادي الموجب, romanized: Wādī al-Mūjib), is a river in Jordan. The river empties into the Dead Sea circa 420 metres (1,380 ft) below sea level.\nIn ancient times, the river served as the northern boundary of the kingdom of Moab.\nToday, the Wadi Mujib is fed by seven tributaries. The western part of the river is the site of the Mujib Biosphere Reserve, popular for hikes and canyoning amid dramatic rock formations.\n\nGeography\nDuring the last ice age the water level of the Dead Sea reached 180 metres (590 ft) below sea level, about 240 metres (790 ft) higher than it is today. It flooded the lower areas of the canyons along its banks, which became bays and begun to accumulate sediments. As the climatic conditions changed, about 20,000 years ago, the water level of the lake dropped, leaving the re-emergent canyons blocked with lake marl. Most canyons managed to cut through their plugged outlets and to resume their lower courses; but Wadi Mujib abandoned its former outlet by breaking through a cleft in the sandstone. This narrow cleft became the bottleneck of an enormous drainage basin of 6,571 km2 (2,537 sq mi) with a huge discharge and annual sediment yield of 143,780 tonnes. During the years the cleft was scoured deeper and the gorge of Wadi Mujib was formed.\nThe Mujib Dam was completed in 2004 at the bottom of the wadi, where the modern road crosses the river. As a result, a large lake has formed.\n\nMujib Reserve\nThe Mujib Reserve of Wadi Mujib is located in the mountainous landscape to the east of the Dead Sea, in the southern part of Jordan valley, approximately 90 kilometres (56 mi) south of Amman. A 212 km2 (82 sq mi) reserve was created in 1987 by the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature and is regionally and internationally important, particularly for the bird life that the reserve supports. In 2011, UNESCO declared Mujib biosphere reserve. It extends to the Kerak and Madaba mountains to the north and south, reaching 1,277 metres (4,190 ft) above sea level in some places. This 1,708-metre (5,604 ft) variation in elevation of its drainage basin, combined with the valley's year round water flow from seven tributaries, means that Wadi Mujib enjoys magnificent biodiversity that is still being explored and documented. The reserve consists of mountainous, rocky, and sparsely vegetated desert (up to 800 metres (2,600 ft)), with cliffs and gorges cutting through plateaus. Perennial, spring-fed streams flow to the shores of the Dead Sea.\nOver 300 species of plants, 10 species of carnivores and numerous species of permanent and migratory birds have been recorded. Some of the remote mountain and valley areas are difficult to reach, and thus offer safe haven for rare species of cats, goats and other mountain animals.\nThe slopes of the mountainous land are very sparsely vegetated, with a steppe-type vegetation on plateaus. Groundwater seepage does occur in places along the Dead Sea shore, for example at the hot springs of Zara, which support a luxuriant thicket of Acacia, Tamarix, Phoenix and Nerium, and a small marsh. The less severe slopes of the reserve are used by pastoralists for the grazing of sheep and goats.\nThe hot springs of Hammamat Ma'in lie close to the borders of the reserve and popular for tourism and recreation.\nThe Jordanian military have a temporary camp in the south of the reserve.\n\nBiology and ecology\nFauna\nThe reserve is strategically important as a safe stop-over for the huge number of migratory birds which fly annually along the Great Rift Valley between Africa and northeast Europe.\nIt is possible to see the following birds in Wadi Mujib:\n\nLammergeier (Gypaetus barbatus)\nEgyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus)\nEurasian griffon (Gyps fulvus)\nLevant sparrowhawk (Accipiter brevipes)\nLesser kestrel (Falco naumanni)\nSooty falcon (Falco concolor)\nSand partridge (Ammoperdix heyi)\nHume's owl (Strix butleri)\nHooded wheatear (Oenanthe monacha)\nBlackstart (Cercomela melanura)\nArabian babbler (Turdoides squamiceps)\nStriolated bunting (Emberiza striolata)\nTrumpeter finch (Bucanetes githagineus)\nDead Sea sparrow (Passer moabiticus)\nTristram's starling (Onychognathus tristramii)\nMany carnivores also inhabit the various vegetation zones in Mujib, such as the striped hyena and the Syrian wolf.\nAnother common animal in Mujib is the Nubian ibex, a large mountain goat which became threatened as a result of over-hunting.\n\nHistory\nIron Age and biblical narrative\nWadi Mujib, or the Arnon Stream as it was known in biblical times, has always been an important boundary-line. Bible scholars have noticed a seeming contradiction in the Hebrew Bible regarding the ownership of the area between the Arnon and Jabbok rivers. According to Numbers, that area originally belonged to the Moabites and was later conquered by Sihon, king of the Amorites, before the Israelites took it (Numbers 21:13–26). However, Judges presents this land as initially Ammonite territory, which the Israelites took from Sihon.(Judges 11:18).\nFollowing the Israelite settlement the stream divided, theoretically at least, Moab from the tribes of Reuben and Gad (Deuteronomy 3:12–16). But Moab, in fact, lay as much to the north as it did to the south of the Arnon. To the north, for example, were Aroer, Dibon, Medeba, and other Moabite towns. Even under Omri and Ahab, who held part of the Moabite territory, Israel did not hold sway farther south than Ataroth, about ten miles north of the Arnon.\nMesha, King of Moab, in his inscription (Mesha Stele, line 10) says that the Gadites (not the Reubenites) formerly occupied Ataroth, whence he in turn expelled the people of Israel. He mentions (line 26) his having constructed a road along the Arnon. The ancient importance of the river and of the towns in its vicinity is attested by the numerous ruins of bridges, forts, and buildings found upon or near it. Its fords are alluded to by the Book of Isaiah (16:2). Its \"heights,\" crowned with the castles of chiefs, were also celebrated in verse (Numbers 21:28).\n\nHellenistic and Roman periods\nWadi Mujib has been identified as a possible location of the Forest of Jardes, mentioned by the first-century historian Josephus in connection with the later stages of the First Jewish Revolt. In 71 CE, one year after the fall of Jerusalem and shortly after the surrender of the fortress at Machaerus, Roman legate Sextus Lucilius Bassus pursued and killed Jewish rebels in the area.\nIn Roman times, a fort garrisoned by Cohors III Alpinorum, known as Apud Arnona, was situated close to the point where the Via Nova route crossed the Arnon river. One of the river's confluents, Seil Heidan, was known in Roman times as Aidonas.\n\nPanorama\nSee also\nDana Biosphere Reserve\nAzraq Wetland Reserve\nNature Reserves in Jordan\nWadi Zarqa\n Jordan portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThe Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature, Jordan\nFlora and Fauna of Wadi Mujib\nConstraints for Sustainable Eco Tourism in Mujib\nPhotos of Wadi Mujib at the American Center of Research",

It's a popular site for canyoning.\n\n## Get in\nBe sure to put the activity centre into any route planner, as Google maps will take you to the other end of the Wadi which is about 20 km away from the entrance.\nThe activity centre is around 1 hr 20 min from Amman by car. Public transport options are fairly limited so if you don't have a car the best option might be to hire a taxi. In low season it is possible to hire a taxi from Amman with some haggling for 50 JD (as of Sep 2022) including sufficient waiting time at Wadi Mujib and the Dead Sea (there's a free public beach around 500 m south of the activity centre). Ride-hailing apps Careem and Uber are also options for getting there; prices from 20 JD one way (September 2022), but getting a lift back may prove more of an issue. It is useful to show the taxi driver the quote from Careem when negotiating a price.\n\n## Fees and permits\nEntrance is controlled by a private company, for the basic trail (with no guide) it costs 21 JD (as of Sep 2022) per person, and includes life jacket rental only. Water shoes are available to rent as are dry bags although the latter costs 10 JD (cash only) although you shouldn't count on them keeping your things dry. As of Sep 2022, there are no lockers or other storage facility's available.\nThe number of people allowed in is limited so depending on the time for the day, you may have to wait to buy your ticket. This can take over an hour, so most recommend going early.\nThe main trail is usually only open for 3 months a year depending on water levels, so might be useful to call ahead.\n\n## Eat\nThere is a café on site, but it was closed as of Sep 2022, so it's a good idea to bring your own food and water.

Located about 15 km southwest of the town of Wadi as-Seer, it has a population of about 6000 people, mostly members of the Abbadi tribe. It is located on hills with high and medium altitude, in an area with many springs and famous for its olive trees and other forest trees.\nThere are many caves in the hills which were inhabited during the Copper Age. There are also remarkable Roman-Byzantine architectural remains. It is a large cave church – closed because of on-going excavations –, and a second church built outside right in front of it. The entrance of the cave can be identified by a façade decorated with a pediment with crosses. The site is called Mugharat al-Kaniseh (Cave of the Church) by the local community. \n\n About 500 metres south of the town stands an archaeological site known as Al-Iraq, dominated by a partially restored Hellenistic period palace known as Qasr al-Abd, which is dated to the late 2nd century BCE. Most scholars agree that Qasr al-Abd was built by the Tobiads, a notable Jewish family of the Second Temple period. This identification is based on a Hebrew inscription found in a nearby burial cave that mentions the name \"Tobiah\".\nIraq Al-Amir is a stop on the Jordan Trail. It is a side trip of Region 3, Salt to Wadi Zarqa (84.4 km). It is 22.3 km from Salt or 15.2 km from Fuheis. From Iraq Al-Amir, the trail makes its way to Husban (19.5 km away).\n\nHistory of settlement\nThe area was first settled in the Middle Stone Age (c. 20,000–10,000 PB). The caves dwellings continued to be used throughout the Bronze Age, as well as the first and second parts of the Iron Age.\nHuman presence continued in the site throughout the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, and reached its peak during the Hellenistic period, after Alexander the Great conquered the region in 332 BCE. The Seleucid king Ptolemy II Philadelphus built a town in that location, transferring population from Tyre, Phoenicia, so that during Hellenistic rule, Iraq al-Amir was known under the Greek name Tyros. The Tobiad palace of Qasr al-Abd was built in the same era.\nThe city particularly prospered in the Byzantine period. It was built around the 3rd century BCE, and reused under Byzantine rule before being destroyed by an earthquake. Pieces of Islamic pottery were also discovered at the site, specifically from the Umayyad and Mamluk times.\n\nQasr al-Abd\nOne of the striking sights at Iraq al-Amir is the Qasr al-Abd palace  (Arabic: قصر العبد, lit. 'Castle of the Slave'), considered as one of the most important Hellenistic remains in Jordan. The first known written description of the palace and its creation comes down to us from Flavius Josephus, a Jewish-Roman historian from the first century CE. The castle was used during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. The rectangular building was constructed from white limestone from the surrounding area and measures 18x37.5 metres, rising to about 14 metres. The walls are between 90 centimetres to 3.90 metres thick. Josephus maintained that it was surrounded by a moat and a protective wall.\nThe ground floor of the castle has a north and a south gate, as well as a north and south corridor. On the west side of both gates, there are four rooms. On the east side\nthere are steps leading to the second floor. On the north side there are water tanks and two lobbies. On the east side are seven windows for lighting and ventilation.\nThe upper floor has bedrooms and reception rooms. This part of the castle was unfinished, and was partly destroyed by an earthquake in the fourth century CE.\nIn the summer of 2018, Qasr al-Abd was renovated by the Jordanian Ministry of Tourism and Antiques. Several paved pathways were created around the structure and a building now houses a small theatre that plays an animation, narrated in Arabic and subtitled in French. The animation illustrates what is thought to be the original vision for the dwelling, a summer lodge, surrounded by water, to give the illusion of a boat floating in a sea.\n\nWomen's Cooperative\nIraq Al-Amir is home to the Iraq Al-Amir Women's Cooperative. The Iraq Al-Amir Knowledge Station is located a short distance opposite the parking for the cave parking. It is next to the mosque. The cooperative involves women and girls from nearby Wadi Al Seer villages and produces hand-made paper, ceramics and clay pottery, as well as hand-woven fabrics. The fabric is crafted in a traditional manner, using a hand-weaving mill and three looms.\n\nSee also\nJordan Trail\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nWill, E. and Larché, F., 'Iraq al Amir, le Château du Tobiade Hyrcan. 2 vols (Paris: P.

          "content": "Umm ar-Rasas (Arabic: أم الرّصاص; ancient name: Kastron Mefa'a) is located 30 km southeast of Madaba in the Amman Governorate in central Jordan. It was once accessible by branches of the King's Highway, and is situated in the semi-arid steppe region of the Jordanian Desert. The site has been associated with the biblical settlement of Mephaat mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah. The Roman military utilized the site as a strategic garrison, but it was later converted and inhabited by Christian and Islamic communities. In 2004, the site was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is valued by archaeologists for its extensive ruins dating to the Roman, Byzantine, and early Muslim periods. The Franciscan academic society in Jerusalem, Studium Biblicum Franciscanum (SBF), carried out excavations at the north end of the site in 1986, but much of the area remains buried under debris.\n\nEarly history\nParticularly during the epochs of the Early Bronze Age III-IV, Iron Age II, and Roman-Byzantine eras, dense populations inhabited the topographical regions beyond the western banks of the Dead Sea. Among these ancient settlements, the site of Mephaat has been mentioned in biblical texts as one of the cities upon the plateau to be condemned to great destruction (Jeremiah 48:21). Many branches of the King's Highway provided a means for reaching the more remote ancient cities, but the main route served as the forerunner for the Via Traiana Nova built by the Roman Emperor Trajan (98–117 AD). This road with its many branches facilitated travel, and Roman military encampments were set in place along the way as a defensive measure against barbarian assaults across the Roman desert frontier known as the Limes Arabicus. Eusebius of Caesarea identified Mephaat as the camp site of a Roman army near the desert in his Onomasticon (K.128:21). Also, the excavation of a Byzantine church here exposed an inscription naming the area as \"Castron Mephaa\" further supporting the theory that Umm-ar Rasas and the biblical Mephaat are one and the same.\n\nMosaics\nThe most important discovery on the site was the mosaic floor of the Church of St Stephen. It was made in 785 (discovered after 1986). The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan. On the central panel, hunting and fishing scenes are depicted, while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region including Philadelphia (Amman), Madaba, Esbounta (Heshbon), Belemounta (Ma'an), Areopolis (Ar-Rabba), Charac Moaba (Karak), Jerusalem, Nablus, Caesarea, and Gaza. The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative. Six mosaic masters signed the work: Staurachios from Esbus, Euremios, Elias, Constantinus, Germanus, and Abdela. To the north of the St. Stephen's church lies another, damaged, mosaic floor in the earlier (587) Church of Bishop Sergius. Another four churches were excavated nearby, some with traces of mosaic decoration.\n\nByzantine period\nBy the 4th century C.E., the advent of pilgrimage caused Palestine to become the nucleus of the Christian world, and scores of pious men and women traversed the desert seeking sites of scriptural significance as well as communion with their creator. The number of pilgrims intensified by the 5th century C.E., and many Christians chose to settle in the desert establishing monastic communities. Umm ar-Rasas was converted into an ecclesiastical center boasting numerous Byzantine churches. Among the notable finds unearthed at Umm-ar Rasas is the Church of Saint Stephen, which features elaborate and sophisticated mosaics. The discovery of Greek inscriptions within the mosaics confirmed dating to 756-785 C.E. The date range coincides with the Abbasid Caliphate period of Muslim rule, and demonstrates Christian occupation later than surrounding areas. The mosaics illustrate municipal vignettes with explanatory text covering a series of cities in Palestine, Jordan, and along the Nile Delta. Absent from the mosaics at Umm ar-Rasas are portrayals of principal holy places revered by pilgrims such as Bethlehem, Hebron or Nazareth unlike the Madaba Map found nearby.\n\nStylite tower\nThe salient feature of Umm ar-Rasas stands about 1 mile (1.6 km) north of the walled ruins. Interpreted to be a stylite tower, the soaring structure served as a platform for Christian ascetics living in isolation at the top as well as an altar for a call to prayer. Ornamented with carved Christian symbols on all four sides, the square pillar endures in the distance as evidence of the once flourishing community established in the Byzantine era as a center for spiritual enlightenment.\n\nMuslim conquest\nMuslim armies penetrated Palestine during the summer of 634 C.E., and initially assaulted regions along the Mediterranean coast including the Gaza Strip. Discontented with Byzantine control, local Arab-speaking tribesmen living in the desert expanses willingly aided the Muslim invaders easing their conquest. The efficacious campaign was characterized by limited destruction, and many cities of the Holy Land surrendered on terms to Muslim rule. Byzantine churches were infrequently transformed into mosques, but especially during the Abbasid period, the Muslim government actively enforced restrictive laws against Christian images. Mosaics were defaced by the removal and reassembly of colored tesserae as seen at the Church of Saint Stephen. Following the Muslim victory, Christians continued to make pilgrimages to holy places, however, the numbers declined with the threat of imprisonment by Muslim officials. Many of the monasteries and churches built by Byzantine Christians were ultimately abandoned.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nEarly Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East\nMichele Piccirillo, SBF archaeologist who led the digs and published the results\nPetra\nWadi Rum\nQasr Amra\nList of World Heritage Sites in Jordan\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n Media related to Umm ar-Rasas at Wikimedia Commons\nVery informative site in English\nUmm ar-Rasas panoramic video\nPhotos of Umm er-Rasas at the American Center of Research\nPhotos of Umm al-Rasas at the Manar al-Athar photo archive",

In 2004, the site was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is valued by archaeologists for its extensive ruins dating to the Roman, Byzantine, and early Muslim periods. The Franciscan academic society in Jerusalem, Studium Biblicum Franciscanum (SBF), carried out excavations at the north end of the site in 1986, but much of the area remains buried under debris.",

The majority of the site has not been excavated. Among the portions excavated so far include a military camp, and several churches. For its unique blend of civilizations, Um er-Rasas was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site  in 2004.\nThe most important discovery on the site was the mosaic floor of the Church of St Stephen. It was made in 785 (discovered after 1986). The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan. On the central panel hunting and fishing scenes are depicted while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region (including Kastron Mefaa, Philadelphia, Madaba, Esbounta, Belemounta, Areopolis, Charac Moaba, Jerusalem, Nablus, Caesarea and Gaza). The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative. Six mosaic masters signed the work: Staurachios from Esbus, Euremios, Elias, Constantinus, Germanus and Abdela. It overlays another, damaged, mosaic floor of the earlier (587) \"Church of Bishop Sergius.\" Another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration.",

          "content": "The Azraq Wetland Reserve is a nature reserve located in the town of Azraq in the eastern desert of Jordan. An oasis for migratory birds, the reserve was established in 1978 and covers 12 square kilometres (4.6 sq mi). The natural springs dried up in 1992 and most migratory birds subsequently moved away from the area. Artificial springs are maintained today in order to keep the site a tourist destination.\n\nHistory\nThe wetlands were created around 250,000 BC as a result of being fed by aquifers. Azraq has, since ancient times, been the crossroads of both human trade routes and bird migrations. Millions of cubic meters of freshwater attracted camels caravans carrying spices and herbs traveling between Arabia, Mesopotamia, and Syria. Millions of migrating birds stopped in Azraq between Africa and Europe. However, in the 1960s, water from the acquifers began to be pumped to support Amman's booming population. In 1978, the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) established Azraq as a wetlands reserve.  By 1992, however, the springs had dried up, and the aquifers that had once gushed ceased to provide. All the water buffalos of Azraq died, and many migrating birds went to the Sea of Galilee instead.\n\nAzraq today\nThe Azraq wetlands have been described as in a state of \"ecological collapse\". RSCN continues to fight an uphill battle against rising population and a growing demand for water. The 10,000,000 cubic metres (353,146,667 cu ft) of water per year provided by the Jordanian Ministry of Water to maintain Azraq is only sufficient to restore Azraq to 10% of its original size. As of 2018, there are more than 500 illegal wells still pumping water from Azraq. In just 37 years, the number of migrant birds has reduced from 347,000 as of February 2, 1967, to 1200 birds as of February 2, 2000. Azraq provides drinking water for one-quarter of Amman. 25 square kilometres (9.7 sq mi) once covered by wetlands have now dried up.\n\nAccommodation\nRSCN maintains an Azraq Lodge several kilometers away from the wetlands which features a gift shop, restaurant, 16 rooms in a 1940s British military hospital, and a reception area.\n\nTrails and activities\nThe Marsh Trail is a raised platform going through the reserve that is approximately 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi). Sections of the trail are on land going through the reeds. Halfway through the trail is the mud-brick \"rustic bird hide\", overlooking one of the reserve's lagoons, which is used for birdwatching.\n\nWildlife\nBirds migrating between Africa and Eurasia stop in Azraq during the long journey each year, passing through Anatolia along the way. The partial restoration of the wetlands by RSCN have resulted in the return of several migratory species, such as the hoopoe lark, Cetti's warbler, the desert finch, and the marsh harrier. Among the 280 recorded migratory species in Azraq are the ruff, avocet, little stint, and the little ringed plover. Additionally, several birds of prey stop in Azraq, such as the European honey buzzard and Montagu's harrier.\n\nPrehistoric wildlife\nFrom ancient times, Azraq was an ecological extension of Africa. In this time period, many animals often characterized as African lived in Azraq. Among these species were the Syrian wild ass, wild camel, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, Asian elephant, gazelle, aurochs, Asiatic cheetah, Syrian ostrich, Asiatic lion, and Arabian oryx. All of these animals, except the gazelle, are now extinct in Azraq, and Jordan alike.\n\nReligious Significance\nThe German mystic, Bl. Anne Catherine Emmerich, identifies the Azraq wetland as the place at which Jesus Christ visited the last two surviving of the Three Kings, who had journeyed to meet him, at his birth, and who had afterward resided there.\n\nSee also\nDana Biosphere Reserve\nWadi Mujib\nWadi Rum\nDibeen Forest Reserve\nShaumari Wildlife Reserve\nRoyal Society for the Conservation of Nature\nList of nature reserves in Jordan\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nRoyal Society for the Conservation of Nature\nWheel shapes near Azraq Oasis, visible only from the air\nGallery of aerial photos, Azraq Wheels",

          "content": "Fuheis (Arabic: الفحيص) is a Christian majority town in the central Jordanian governorate of Balqa. It lies in between Salt and Amman, at a distance of 6 and 13 kilometers respectively. .\n\nThe population of Fuheis was estimated to be 21,908 in 2021, 87% are Jordanian citizens, 95% are Christians, and with a male-to-female ratio of 52:48.\nAccording to a national census in 2015, the population was 18,916, there were 4,658 households in the town with an average of 4.06 persons per household, lower than the national average of 4.82 persons per household. The population of Fuheis increases in the summer, as many of the town's residents who have emigrated to the United States and Europe return for their summer vacations. The town's elevation renders it cool enough to spend the summer comfortably.\nFuheis is also famous for its traditional habits from singing and dancing (dabke), and for depending on its farms.\n\nHistory\nIn 1838 Fuheis was noted located east of Al-Salt.\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 2,946 inhabitants in Fuheis,  of whom 2,391 were Christians.\n\nGeography and climate\nThe town has an elevation ranging from 740 to 1,050 meters (2,430 to 3,440 ft) above mean sea level, and experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa). It receives approximately 500 mm (20 in) of precipitation annually, with occasional snowfall accumulating on its peaks.\n\nEconomy and development\nFuheis' economy has historically centered around agriculture. Most of Fuheis' population works in agriculture, trade, cement industry, service industry, and civil or office jobs. The olive industry is important to Fuheis' economy, along with orchards and vineyards. The cement factory - Jordan's largest - is by far the largest industry in Fuheis, employing about 70% of the town's population. Among its most important villages are al-Rahwa, Ras al-Jundi, and al-Suqariah, known for their farms and trees.\nIn 2010, German researchers from the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research implemented a demonstration facility for decentralised wastewater technology in Fuheis. The project was handed over to the management of Al-Balqa` Applied University.\n\nReligion\nApproximately 60% of the town's population belong to Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, 35% are members of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. Sunni Muslims and Armenian Orthodox Christians make up the rest 5% of the population. \nThe Latin Parish of Fuheis established a secondary school during the Ottoman Period in 1885. Students of this school learned Arabic, Religion and Math. The school has since expanded, remaining open until today.\n\nHeritage and archaeology\nArchaeological excavations in Fuheis uncovered a circular building from white limestone which dates back to the Iron Age and the Byzantine age. This building was repurposed as a church in the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, and within the building is a blueprint of the church in addition to a number of graves that were built in the church's land. The excavations suggest that the area's water sources may have drawn many to the region or that the settlement had a military purpose. The ruins are surrounded by small dug wells and enclosed water closets which were connected by a spout carved from rock. \nIn the same area, excavators found a carving on basalt rock in Greek letters and crosses carved into limestone.\n\nCulture\nAl-Rowaq\nFuheis' Rowaq Al-Balqa' district boasts hundred-year-old stone cottages in the old town, preserved by a local who bought an art gallery in the area and proceeded to buy several cottages near it, converting them to art-and-craft shops.\n\nTourism and Outdoor Activities\nFuhais is increasingly recognized not only for its historical and cultural significance but also for its emerging outdoor activities, particularly rock climbing.\n\nRock Climbing\nFuhais has become a notable climbing destination in Jordan, attracting local and international climbers. The area features limestone cliffs with multiple bolted sport routes of varying difficulty, making it a popular alternative to the traditional climbing of Wadi Rum.\nThe development of climbing routes in Fuhais was pioneered by Hakim Tamimi, a Jordanian climber who has been instrumental in bolting sport climbing areas across the country. His contributions to Fuhais and other climbing areas such as Dur Morsud and Iraq Al Dub have been documented in international climbing reports and academic studies.\nSeveral international climbing events and trips have been hosted in Fuhais, contributing to Jordan's growing reputation as a Middle Eastern climbing hub. Climbers visiting Fuhais often combine their trip with other adventure activities in nearby regions, further supporting adventure tourism in Jordan.\nMore information on climbing routes and conditions can be found on adventure platforms and climbing community websites.\n\nFuheis festival\nFuheis Festival is an annually held event in Fuheis, and it is considered to be the second biggest festival in Jordan, after Jerash Festival.\nThey have celebrated their silver jubilee in 2016, where they have welcomed bands and artists from Jordan, Syria, Palestine and Lebanon to perform in concerts and poetry evenings.\nSeveral artists and singers from across the region were invited to perform in the town, like: Wadih El Safi, Melhem Barakat, Sabah Fakhri, Fares Karam, Moeen Charif, Omar Al-Abdallat, George Kurdahi, Najwa Karam, and many more, and the variety of night events and activities attracts around 10,000 to 30,000 visitors yearly.\n\nList of mayors of Fuhais\nSee also\nGreek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem\nLatin Patriarchate of Jerusalem\nJordanian Christians\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\nFuheis.net Archived 2010-12-30 at the Wayback Machine\nPhotos of Fuheis from the American Center of Research\n[1]",

          "title": "Salt",
          "content": "Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl). When used in food, especially in granulated form, it is more formally called table salt. In the form of a natural crystalline mineral, salt is also known as rock salt or halite. Salt is essential for life in general (being the source of the essential dietary minerals sodium and chlorine), and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings, and is known to uniformly improve the taste perception of food. Salting, brining, and pickling are ancient and important methods of food preservation.\nSome of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6000 BC, when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt works in China dates to approximately the same period. Salt was prized by the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Hittites, Egyptians, and Indians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues, for instance triggering the El Paso Salt War which took place in El Paso in the late 1860s. Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance.\nSalt is processed from salt mines, and by the evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. The greatest single use for salt (sodium chloride) is as a feedstock for the production of chemicals. It is used to produce caustic soda and chlorine, and in the manufacture of products such as polyvinyl chloride, plastics, and paper pulp. Of the annual global production of around three hundred million tonnes, only a small percentage is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt. Table salt usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.\nSodium is an essential element for human health via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic solute. However, excessive salt consumption increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. Such health effects of salt have long been studied. Numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods. The World Health Organization recommends that adults consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium, equivalent to 5 grams of salt, per day.\n\nHistory\nAll through history, the availability of salt has been pivotal to civilization. What is now thought to have been the first city in Europe is Solnitsata, in Bulgaria, which was a salt mine, providing the area now known as the Balkans with salt since 5400 BC. Salt was the best-known food preservative, especially for meat, for many thousands of years. A very ancient salt-works operation has been discovered at the Poiana Slatinei archaeological site next to a salt spring in Lunca, Neamț County, Romania. Evidence indicates that Neolithic people of the Precucuteni Culture were boiling the salt-laden spring water through the process of briquetage to extract salt as far back as 6050 BC. The salt extracted from this operation may have directly correlated with the rapid growth of this society's population soon after production began. The harvest of salt from the surface of Xiechi Lake near Yuncheng in Shanxi, China, dates back to at least 6000 BC, making it one of the oldest verifiable saltworks.\nThere is more salt in animal tissues, such as meat, blood, and milk, than in plant tissues. Nomads who subsist on their flocks and herds do not eat salt with their food, but agriculturalists, feeding mainly on cereals and vegetable matter, need to supplement their diet with salt. With the spread of civilization, salt became one of the world's main trading commodities. It was of high value to the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites and other peoples of antiquity. In the Middle East, salt was used to seal an agreement ceremonially, and the ancient Hebrews made a \"covenant of salt\" with God and sprinkled salt on their offerings to show their trust in him. \nAn ancient practice in time of war was salting the earth: scattering salt around in a defeated city to symbolically prevent plant growth. The Bible tells the story of King Abimelech who was ordered by God to do this at Shechem. Texts claim that the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus Africanus ploughed over and sowed the city of Carthage with salt after it was defeated in the Third Punic War (146 BC), although this story is now considered to be entirely apocryphal.\nSalt may have been used for barter in connection with the obsidian trade in Anatolia in the Neolithic Era. Salt was included among funeral offerings found in ancient Egyptian tombs from the third millennium BC, as were salted birds, and salt fish. From about 2800 BC, the Egyptians began exporting salt fish to the Phoenicians in return for Lebanon cedar, glass, and the dye Tyrian purple. The Phoenicians traded Egyptian salted fish and salt from North Africa throughout their Mediterranean trade empire. Herodotus described salt trading routes across Libya back in the 5th century BC. In the early years of the Roman Empire, roads were built for the transportation of salt from the salt imported at Ostia to the capital.\nIn Africa, salt was used as currency south of the Sahara. Slabs of rock salt were used as coins in Abyssinia. The Tuareg have traditionally maintained routes across the Sahara especially for the transportation of salt by Azalai salt caravans. The caravans still cross the desert from southern Niger to Bilma, although much of the trade now takes place by truck. Each camel takes two bales of fodder and two of trade goods northwards and returns laden with salt pillars and dates. In Gabon, before the arrival of Europeans, the coast people carried on a remunerative trade with those of the interior by the medium of sea salt. This was gradually displaced by the salt that Europeans brought in sacks, so that the coast natives lost their previous profits; as of the late 1950s, sea salt was still the currency best appreciated in the interior.\nSalzburg, Hallstatt, and Hallein lie within 17 km (11 mi) of each other on the river Salzach in central Austria in an area with extensive salt deposits. Salzach means \"salt river\", while Salzburg means \"salt castle\", both taking their names from the German word Salz, salt. Hallstatt was the site of the world's first salt mine. The town gave its name to the Hallstatt culture that began mining for salt in the area in about 800 BC. Around 400 BC, the townsfolk, who had previously used pickaxes and shovels, began open pan salt making. During the first millennium BC, Celtic communities grew rich trading salt and salted meat to Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome in exchange for wine and other luxuries.\nThe word salary comes from the Latin word for salt. The reason for this is unknown; a persistent modern claim that the Roman Legions were sometimes paid in salt is baseless. The word salad literally means \"salted\", and comes from the ancient Roman practice of salting leaf vegetables.\nWars have been fought over salt. Venice won the Salt War (1304) with Padua over supplying the product in certain areas, and the War of Ferrara (1482–1484) for the same reason. It played a role in the American Revolution and the San Elizario Salt War. Cities on overland trade routes grew rich by levying duties, and towns like Liverpool flourished on the export of salt extracted from the salt mines of Cheshire. Governments have at different times imposed salt taxes on their peoples. The voyages of Christopher Columbus are said to have been financed from salt production in southern Spain. The oppressive salt tax in France was one of the causes of the French Revolution. After being repealed, this tax was reimposed by Napoleon when he became emperor to pay for his foreign wars, and was not abolished until 1946. In 1930, Mahatma Gandhi led a crowd of 100,000 protestors on the \"Dandi March\" or \"Salt Satyagraha\", during which they made their own salt from the sea as a demonstration of their opposition to the colonial salt tax. This act of civil disobedience inspired numerous Indians and transformed the Indian independence movement into a national struggle.\n\nPhysical properties\nSalt is mostly sodium chloride (NaCl). Sea salt and mined salt may contain trace elements. Mined salt is often refined. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. When dissolved in water sodium chloride separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12 °C (−6.02 °F) for 23.31 wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7 °C (227.7 °F).\n\nEdible salt\nSalt is essential to the health of humans and other animals, and it is one of the five basic taste sensations. It is known to uniformly improve the taste perception of food, including otherwise unpalatable food. Salt is used in many cuisines, and it is often found in salt shakers on diners' eating tables for their personal use on food. Salt is also an ingredient in many manufactured foodstuffs. Table salt is a refined salt containing about 97 to 99 percent sodium chloride. Usually, anticaking agents such as sodium aluminosilicate or magnesium carbonate are added to make it free-flowing. Iodized salt, containing potassium iodide, is widely available. Some people put a desiccant, such as a few grains of uncooked rice or a saltine cracker, in their salt shakers to absorb extra moisture and help break up salt clumps that may otherwise form.\n\nFortified table salt\nSome table salt sold for consumption contains additives that address a variety of health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of additives vary from country to country. Iodine is an important micronutrient for humans, and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine (hypothyroidism) and enlargement of the thyroid gland (endemic goitre) in adults or cretinism in children. Iodized salt has been used to correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide, sodium iodide, or sodium iodate. A small amount of dextrose may be added to stabilize the iodine. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities. Iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used.\nThe amount of iodine and the specific iodine compound added to salt varies. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends 150 micrograms of iodine per day for both men and women. US iodized salt contains 46–77 ppm (parts per million), whereas in the UK the recommended iodine content of iodized salt is 10–22 ppm.\nSodium ferrocyanide, yellow prussiate of soda, is sometimes added to salt as an anticaking agent. Such anticaking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely. The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive was found to be provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988. Other anticaking agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or magnesium carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two compounds.\nIn \"doubly fortified salt\", both iodide and iron salts are added. The latter alleviates iron deficiency anaemia, which interferes with the mental development of an estimated 40% of infants in the developing world. A typical iron source is ferrous fumarate. Another additive, especially important for pregnant women, is folic acid (vitamin B9), which gives the table salt a yellow colour. Folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects and anaemia, which affect young mothers, especially in developing countries.\nA lack of fluoride in the diet is the cause of a greatly increased incidence of dental caries. Fluoride salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries where water fluoridation is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.\n\nOther kinds\nUnrefined sea salt contains small amounts of magnesium and calcium halides and sulfates, traces of algal products, salt-resistant bacteria and sediment particles. The calcium and magnesium salts confer a faintly bitter overtone, and they make unrefined sea salt hygroscopic, i.e., it gradually absorbs moisture from air if stored uncovered. Algal products contribute a mildly \"fishy\" or \"sea-air\" odour, the latter from organobromine compounds. Sediments, the proportion of which varies with the source, give the salt a dull grey appearance.\nSince taste and aroma compounds are often detectable by humans in minute concentrations, sea salt may have a more complex flavour than pure sodium chloride when sprinkled on top of food. When salt is added during cooking however, these flavours would likely be overwhelmed by those of the food ingredients. The refined salt industry cites scientific studies saying that raw sea and rock salts do not contain enough iodine salts to prevent iodine deficiency diseases.\nSalts have diverse mineralities depending on their source, giving each  a unique flavour. Fleur de sel, a natural sea salt from the surface of evaporating brine in salt pans, has a distinctive flavour varying with its source. In traditional Korean cuisine, so-called \"bamboo salt\" is prepared by roasting salt in a bamboo container plugged with mud at both ends. This product absorbs minerals from the bamboo and the mud, and has been claimed to increase the anticlastogenic and antimutagenic properties of doenjang, a fermented bean paste. Kosher or kitchen salt has a larger grain size than table salt and is used in cooking. It can be useful for brining, in bread or pretzel making, and as a scrubbing agent when combined with oil.\n\nSalt in food\nSalt is present in most foods, but in naturally occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it is present in very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where it functions as both a preservative and a flavouring. Dairy salt is used in the preparation of butter and cheese products. As a flavouring, salt enhances the taste of other foods by suppressing the bitterness of those foods making them more palatable and relatively sweeter.\nBefore the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting was one of the main methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67 mg sodium per 100 g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990 mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63 mg while bacon contains 1,480 mg, and potatoes contain 7 mg but potato crisps 800 mg per 100 g. Salt is used extensively in cooking as a flavouring, and in cooking techniques such as with salt crusts and brining. The main sources of salt in the Western diet, apart from direct use, are bread and cereals, meat, and dairy products.\nIn many East Asian cultures, salt is not traditionally used as a condiment. In its place, condiments such as soy sauce, fish sauce and oyster sauce tend to have a high sodium content and fill a similar role to table salt in western cultures. They are most often used for cooking rather than as table condiments.\n\nBiology of salt taste\nHuman salt taste is detected by sodium taste receptors present in taste bud cells on the tongue. Human sensory taste testing studies have shown that proteolyzed forms of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) function as the human salt taste receptor.\n\nSodium consumption and health\nTable salt is made up of just under 40% sodium by weight, so a 6 g serving (1 teaspoon) contains about 2,400 mg of sodium. Sodium serves a vital purpose in the human body: via its role as an electrolyte, it helps nerves and muscles to function correctly, and it is one factor involved in the osmotic regulation of water content in body organs (fluid balance). Most of the sodium in the Western diet comes from salt. The habitual salt intake in many Western countries is about 10 g per day, and it is higher than that in many countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. The high level of sodium in many processed foods has a major impact on the total amount consumed. In the United States, 75% of the sodium eaten comes from processed and restaurant foods, 11% from cooking and table use and the rest from what is found naturally in foodstuffs.\nBecause consuming too much sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake is associated with a greater risk of stroke, total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000 mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.\nThe World Health Organization recommends that adults should consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium (which is contained in 5 g of salt) per day. Guidelines by the United States recommend that people with hypertension, African Americans, and middle-aged and older adults should limit consumption to no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day and meet the potassium recommendation of 4,700 mg/day with a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables.\nWhile reduction of sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day is recommended by developed countries, one review recommended that sodium intake be reduced to at least 1,200 mg (contained in 3 g of salt) per day, as a further reduction in salt intake led to a greater fall in systolic blood pressure for all age groups and ethnicities. Another review indicated that there is inconsistent/insufficient evidence to conclude that reducing sodium intake to lower than 2,300 mg per day is either beneficial or harmful.\nEvidence shows a more complicated relationship between salt and cardiovascular disease. \"The association between sodium consumption and cardiovascular disease or mortality is U-shaped, with increased risk at both high and low sodium intake.\" The findings showed that increased mortality from excessive salt intake was primarily associated with individuals with hypertension. The levels of increased mortality among those with restricted salt intake appeared to be similar regardless of blood pressure. This evidence shows that while those with hypertension should primarily focus on reducing sodium to recommended levels, all groups should seek to maintain a healthy level of sodium intake of between 4 and 5 grams (equivalent to 10–13 g salt) a day.\nOne of the two most prominent dietary risks for disability in the world are diets high in sodium.\n\nNon-dietary uses\nOnly a small percentage of the salt manufactured in the world is used in food. The remainder is used in agriculture, water treatment, chemical production, de-icing, and other industrial use cases. In the practice of watering plants with salt as a fertilizer, applying a moderate concentration helps avoid potential toxicity; typically, 1–3 grams (0.035–0.106 oz) per liter is considered safe and effective for most plants. Sodium chloride is one of the most widely used inorganic raw materials. It is a feedstock in the production of  caustic soda and chlorine. These are used in the manufacture of PVC, paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic compounds.\nSalt is used as a flux in the production of aluminium. For this purpose, a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants. It is used in the manufacture of soaps and glycerine, where it is used to saponify fats. As an emulsifier, salt is used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber, and another use is in the firing of pottery, when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the ceramic material, forming a strong glaze.\nWhen drilling through loose materials such as sand or gravel, salt may be added to the drilling fluid to provide a stable \"wall\" to prevent the hole collapsing. There are many other processes in which salt is involved. These include its use as a mordant in textile dying, to regenerate resins in water softening, for the tanning of hides, the preservation of meat and fish and the canning of meat and vegetables.\n\nProduction\nFood-grade salt accounts for only a small part of salt production in industrialized countries (7% in Europe), although worldwide, food uses account for 17.5% of total production.\nIn 2018, total world production of salt was 300 million tonnes, the top six producers being China (68 million), the United States (42 million), India (29 million), Germany (13 million), Canada (13 million) and Australia (12 million).\nThe manufacture of salt is one of the oldest chemical industries. A major source of salt is seawater, which has a salinity of approximately 3.5%. This means that there are about 35 g (1.2 oz) of dissolved salts, predominantly sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions, per kilogram (2.2 lbs) of water. The world's oceans are a virtually inexhaustible source of salt, and this abundance of supply means that reserves have not been calculated. The evaporation of seawater is the production method of choice in marine countries with high evaporation and low precipitation rates. Salt evaporation ponds are filled from the ocean and salt crystals can be harvested as the water dries up. Sometimes these ponds have vivid colours, as some species of algae and other micro-organisms thrive in conditions of high salinity.\nAway from the sea, salt is extracted from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These sources are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, purification was achieved in shallow open pans that were heated to accelerate evaporation. Vacuum-based methods are also employed. \nThe raw salt is refined by treatment with chemicals that precipitate most impurities, largely magnesium and calcium salts. Multiple stages of evaporation are then applied. Some salt is produced using the Alberger process, which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake. The Ayoreo, an indigenous group from the Paraguayan Chaco, obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree (Maytenus vitis-idaea) and other trees.\nThe largest mine operated by underground workings in the world is the Sifto mine, located mostly 550 meters below Lake Huron, in Goderich, Ontario (Canada). About seven million tons of salt are extracted from it annually. The  Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan has nineteen storeys, eleven of which are underground, and 400 km (250 mi) of passages. The salt is dug out by the room and pillar method, where about half the material is left in place to support the upper levels. Extraction of Himalayan salt is expected to last 350 years at the present rate of extraction of around 385,000 tons per annum. The mine is also a major tourist attraction, receiving around a quarter of a million visitors a year.\n\nIn religion\nSalt has long held an important place in religion and culture. At the time of Brahmanic sacrifices, in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks at the time of the new moon, salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and some people think this to be the origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith. \nIn Judaism, it is recommended to have either a salty bread, or to add salt to the bread if this bread is unsalted when doing Kiddush for Shabbat. It is customary to spread some salt over the bread or dip it in a little salt when passing it around the table after the Kiddush. To preserve the covenant between their people and God, Jews dip the Sabbath bread in salt. \nSalt plays a role within different Christian traditions. It is mandatory in the rite of the Tridentine Mass. Salt is used in the third item (which includes an Exorcism) of the Celtic Consecration (cf. Gallican Rite) that is employed in the consecration of a church, and it is permitted to be added to the water \"where it is customary\" in the Roman Catholic rite of Holy water. \nThe Bible makes multiple mentions of salt, both of the mineral itself and as a metaphor. Uses include the tale of how Lot's wife is turned into a pillar of salt when looking back at the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah as they are destroyed. In the New Testament, Jesus refers to his followers as the \"salt of the earth\".\nIn Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water. Salt is an auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. In Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. Salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition. When returning home from a funeral, a pinch of salt is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. In Shinto, Shio (塩, lit. \"salt\") is used for ritual purification of locations and people (harae, specifically shubatsu), and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by entrances to ward off evil and to attract patrons.\n\nReferences\n\n\n=== Sources ===",
          "summary": "Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl). When used in food, especially in granulated form, it is more formally called table salt. In the form of a natural crystalline mineral, salt is also known as rock salt or halite. Salt is essential for life in general (being the source of the essential dietary minerals sodium and chlorine), and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings, and is known to uniformly improve the taste perception of food. Salting, brining, and pickling are ancient and important methods of food preservation.\nSome of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6000 BC, when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt works in China dates to approximately the same period. Salt was prized by the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Hittites, Egyptians, and Indians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues, for instance triggering the El Paso Salt War which took place in El Paso in the late 1860s. Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance.\nSalt is processed from salt mines, and by the evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. The greatest single use for salt (sodium chloride) is as a feedstock for the production of chemicals. It is used to produce caustic soda and chlorine, and in the manufacture of products such as polyvinyl chloride, plastics, and paper pulp. Of the annual global production of around three hundred million tonnes, only a small percentage is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt. Table salt usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.\nSodium is an essential element for human health via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic solute. However, excessive salt consumption increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. Such health effects of salt have long been studied. Numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods. The World Health Organization recommends that adults consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium, equivalent to 5 grams of salt, per day.",

          "title": "ملح الطعام",
          "content": "ملح الطعام يتكون الملح المعروف بشكل رئيسي من مركب كيميائي يعرف بكلوريد الصوديوم (NaCl) والذي ينتمي لمجموعة أكبر من الأملاح. يوجد ملح الطعام في الطبيعة على هيئة بلّورات معدنية تُعرف بالملح الصخري أو الهاليت.  يوجد ملح الطعام بكثرة في ماء البحار حيث هو المُكَوِّن المعدني الرَّئيسي فيه. يحتوي المحيط على قرابة 35 جرام من الملح لكل لتر (oz 1.2) وملوحة 3.5%. يُعدُّ الملح ضروريًّا لحياة الحيوان،  ويتواجد في أنسجة الحيوانات أكثر من أنسجة النبّاتات. لذلك فإن نمط غذاء البدو المعتاد الذين يعيشون على قطعانهم لا يُحتاج فيه إلى الملح أو يُضاف بكميَّاتٍ قليلة، بينما نظام الغذاء المعتمد على القمح يحتاج إلى مكمّلات غذائية. وتعد الملوحة أحد أساسيّات حاسَّة التذوق لدى الإنسان. كما أن الملح من أقدم وأوفر التوابل، ويعد التمليح من أهم طرق حفظ الأطعمة.\nتشير بعض الأدلة إلى أن معالجة الملح تعود إلى 8000 سنة مضت، حيث كان سكان رومانيا يغلون مياه الينابيع لاستخراج الملح. كذلك عثر على أدوات لمعالجة الملح في الصين تعود إلى نفس الفترة تقريبًا. وكان يعد الملح ثمينًا عند اليهود قديمًا وكذلك عند كل من الإغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والحيثيّين والمصريّين. أصبح الملح سلعةً ثمينةً وكان يُنقَل بالقوارب عبر البحر المتوسط من خلال طرقٍ خاصَّةٍ بُنِيَت من أجل الملح وبقوافِل عبر الصحراء الكبرى. إن عوز الملح وحاجة الدول له أدت إلى نشوء حروب بينهم، واستعماله لزيادة عائدات الضرائب. كما يستعمل الملح في طقوس بعض الأديان وفي بعض الثقافات.\nتتم معالجة الملح من خلال مناجم الملح، أو عن طريق تبخير مياه البحار أو مياه الينابيع   المليئة بالمعادن.  إن أهم المنتجات الصناعية للملح هي الصودا الكاوية والكلور.  ويستخدم في عمليات صناعية أخرى كتصنيع البوليفنيل كلورايد والبلاستيك وأكوام الورق. إن من مجمل الإنتاج السنوي للملح البالغ قرابة المئتي مليون طن يستهلك الإنسان مايقارب 6% من هذا الإنتاج فقط. بينما يُستخدم الباقي في عمليات معالجة الماء، وإزالة الجليد عن الطرقات، وفي الزراعة. يُباع الملح القابل للأكل بهيئات مختلفة كالملح البحري، وملح الطاولة (ملح الطعام) والذي يكون معالج عادة باليود للحدّ من الإصابة بنقص اليود وكذلك يحتوي عادة على مواد مضادة للتكتل. وكذلك يوجد الملح في كثير من الأطعمة المُعالجة. يُعد الملح غذاء ضروريا، وتتأثر الصحة بمدى كميته في الغذاء. \nإنّ كثرة الملح قد يزيد من ضغط الدم وزيادة احتمالية الإصابة بسكتة أو نوبة قلبية عند بعض الأشخاص. تنصح منظمة الصحة العالمية بأن يستهلك البالغون أقل من 2000 ملي جرام من الصوديوم والذي يعادل 5 جرامات من الملح يوميًّا.\n\nالتاريخ\nعرف ملح الطعام منذ القدم لخصائصه، فاستعمل في الطبخ وكحافظ للأطعمة. واستعمله الإغريق والرومان واليهود في طقوسهم الدينية. اقتصادياً، اكتسب قيمة كبيرة. استعمل في الصين والحبشة للمقايضة وكعملة. في فرنسا، استحدثت ضريبة خاصة بالملح سميت «جبل» مما أثار الناس وكانت أحد أسباب الثورة الفرنسية.\nلطالما مال الناس لبناء مجتمعاتهم حول مصادر الملح، أو في مكان يستطيعون التجارة من أجله. \nوطوال التاريخ كان وجود الملح هامًّا للحضارات. فكلمة \"salary\" والتي تعني أجرة اشتقت من الملح باللاتينية;  نظرا لاستعمال الرومانيين الملحَ أحيانًا كأجرة، حيث كانت قيمته تعادل الذهب.  وفي بريطانيا يعد 'الملحق \"-ويتش\"wich-\" في نهاية أسماء الأماكن دلالة على كونه مصدرًا للملح في فترة من الفترات، كما في مدينتي ساندويتش ونوريتش.\n\nالتركيب الكيميائي\nيتركب الملح بشكل أساسي من المركب الأيوني كلوريد الصوديوم ذي الصيغة الكيميائية NaCl والذي يحتوي نسب متساوية من الصوديوم والكلور.. ويحتوي ملح البحر والملح المستخرج من المناجم (غالبا ما يكون مصدره ماء البحر من بحار عصر ما قبل التاريخ) على العناصر الزهيدة (والمفيدة بكميات قليلة لبعض الحيوانات والنباتات). تتم معالجة الملح المستخرج من المناجم (الملح المعدني) واستخدامه في إنتاج ملح الطعام (ملح الطاولة) عن طريق إذابته في الماء وتنقيته من خلال ترسيب باقي المعادن وإخراجها من المحلول ثم إعادة تبخيره. وغالبا ما يضاف اليود بعد هذه المعالجة. إن بلورات الملح شافَّة (شبه شفافة) غالبا ومكعبة الشكل، وتبدو بيضاء بالغالب لكن قد تعطيها بعض الشوائب لونا أزرق أو أرجواني. تساوي الكتلة المولية للملح 58.443 جم\\مول، ودرجة ذوبانه تساوي 801°م وتساوي درجة غليانه 1465°م. كما تساوي كثافته 2017 جم\\سم3. يُعد الملح سريع الذوبان في الماء ومعدل ذائبيته تساوي 359 جم\\لتر، وعندما يُذاب الملح فيه فإنه ينفصل إلى أيون الصوديوم +Na وأيون الكلوريد - Cl. إن تبلور محلول الماء والملح يُنتج ثنائي الهيدرات NaCl•2H2O. كما أن محاليل كلوريد الصوديوم مع الماء لها خصائص مختلفة عن المياه النقية; حيث تنخفض درجة التجمد إلى -21.12 °م عند كون كتلة الملح 23.31% من المحلول، ودرجة الذوبان لمحلول ملح مشبع تساوي تقريبا 108.7°م.\n\nملح الطعام\nيعد الملح هامًّا لصحة الإنسان والحيوان ويستخدم في مناطق كثيرة من العالم كتوابل. كما تعد الملوحة أهم حواس التذوق الخمسة الأساسية.\nملح الطعام هو ملح معالج يتكون 97%-%99 منه من كلوريد الصوديوم (NaCl) بالإضافة غالبا إلى موانع تكتُّل مثل ألومينوسيليكات الصوديوم أو كربونات المغنيسيوم لِتسهَّل من تدفقه. يتوافر الملح المعالج باليود والذي يحتوي يوديد الصوديوم في دول كثيرة˛ كما يضاف له مجفف أحيانًا كحبوب الأرز أو البسكويت المملح ليساعد على امتصاص الرطوبة وتكسير تكتلات الملح التي قد تنتج منها.\n\nالملح المدعَّم\nتتواجد بعض الإضافات في بعض أنواع ملح الطعام وذلك لتكميل النواقص الغذائية لتفادي بعض الأمراض وخاصة في الدول النامية. تختلف أنواع وكميات المواد المضافة من دولة لأخرى. يعد اليود من الأغذية المُحتاجة بكميَّات قليلة̨ ونقص في كمية هذا العنصر قد تؤدي إلى انخفاض إنتاج الثيروكسين (أحد هرمونات الغدة الدرقية) وبالتالي تحدث حالة قصور الدرقية وتضخم في هذه الغدَّة مما قد ينتج الفدامة عند الأطفال. بدأ استعمال الملح المعالج باليود لتفادي هذه الحالات منذ عام 1924 م. ويتكون هذا الملح من ملح الطعام مع كميات قليلة من يوديد البوتاسيوم أو يوديد الصوديوم أو يودات الصوديوم. كما قد يضاف سكّر أحادي يعرف بالدكستروز ليساعد على تثبيت وتوازن اليود. تُقدر حالات نقص اليود بالعالم إلى حوالي مئتي مليون شخص˛ وهو المسبب الأول الذي من الممكن تفاديه للتخلف العقلي. كما كان استخدام الملح المعالج باليود فعّالا لتفادي حالات نقص اليود.\nتختلف كمية اليود ومركباته من دولة لأخرى فالملح المعالج في الولايات المتحدة يحتوي على 46-77 جزيء من مليون جزيء˛ حيث تنصح هيئة الغذاء والدواء الأمريكية بتناول 150 مايكروجرام من اليود يوميًّا لكل من الذكور والإناث. بينما الكمية الموصى بوضعها في الملح في المملكة المتحدة هي 10-22 جزيء من المليون.\nيضاف حديدوسيانيد الصوديوم أحيانا مع ملح الطعام كمانع للتكتل. ويعد آمنًا للبشر بكميات قليلة حيث تم قبول أدلة عدم سميته كإضافة غذائية من قبل مجلس السموم عام 1988م. بدأ استعمال موانع التكتل عام 1911م عندما استخدم كربونات المغنيسيوم لتسهيل حركة الملح. تستعمل أحيانا بعض موانع التكتل الأخرى كفوسفات ثلاثي الكالسيوم ̨ كربونات المغنيسيوم أو الكالسيوم الملح الحمضي˛ أكسيد المغنيسيوم ˛ ثاني أكسيد السليكون ˛ سيليكات الكالسيوم ̨ ألومينيوسيليكات الصوديوم، وألومينيوسيليكات الكالسيوم. كل من الاتحاد الأوروبي وهيئة الغذاء والدواء الأمريكية سمحا باستعمال الألومنيوم مع المركبين الأخيرتي الذكر.\nيضاف كل من ملح الحديد وملح اليوديد في ما يسمى بتدعيم الملح الثنائي. تكمن فائدة ملح الحديد لتجنب فقر الدم الناجم عن عوز الحديد والذي يؤثر على النمو الذهني فيما يقارب 40% من الرضَّع في الدول النامية. يعد فومارات الحديد الثنائي هو المصدر الرئيسي للحديد.  أحد الإضافات المهمة الأخرى وخاصة للحوامل هي حمض الفوليك (فيتامين ب 9) والذي يعطي لونا أصفرا لملح الطعام. يساعد حمض الفوليك بالوقاية من عيب الأنبوب العصبي وفقر الدم.\nيعد كذلك نقص الفلورين في الحمية سببا لكثير من الإصابات بتسوس الأسنان. قد تضاف أملاح الفلوريد إلى ملح الطعام بهدف تقليل الإصابة بتسوس الأسنان وخاصة في الدول التي لم تستفد من إضاقة الفلور إلى الماء أو معجون الأسنان. ويعد هذا الفعل منتشرًا أكثر في الدول التي لا تضيف الفلور إلى ماء الشرب. 35% من ملح الطعام في فرنسا يحتوي على فلوريد الصوديوم.\n\nأنواع أخرى\nيحتوي الملح غير المعالج على كمّيات قليلة من المغنيسيوم وهاليدات الكالسيوم والكبريت وآثار منتجات الطحالب والجسيمات المترسبة وكذلك بعض البكتيريا المحبة للملوحة. يعطي الكالسيوم والمغنيسيوم قليلا من الطعم المر، ويعطيان الملح خاصية الاسترطاب (امتصاص الماء تدريجيا من الجو). تساهم منتجات الطحالب قليلا بإعطاء الملح رائحة شبيهة بالبحر أو السمك؛ لوجود مركبات البرومين العضوية. أما الجسيمات المترسبة فتعطيه مظهرا رصاصيا باهتا. ونظرًا لاستطاعة الإنسان شم وتذوق المركبات ذات الكميات الصغيرة، فإن الملح البحري عادة ما يكون ذا طعم أكثر تعقيدا من كلوريد الصوديوم النقي. وتشير الدراسات التابعة للملح الصخري بأن الملح البحري أو الصخري اللذان لم يعالجان لا يحتويان على كمية اليود الكافية للوقاية من أمراض نقص اليود. \nيختلف طعم ومدى ملوحة الملح الطبيعي باختلاف مصدره، مما يعطي نكهة خاصة له. ولزهرة الملح (ملح بحري يكون على سطح محاليل الملح المشبعة في الملَّاحات) طعم فريد يختلف من مكان لآخر حسب منطقة استخراجها. في أحد الأطباق الكورية التقليدية والذي يدعى بملح الخيزران يُجهَّز الطبق بتحميص الملح في حاوية من خيزران، وتغلق كلتا نهايتي الحاوية بالطين، حيث يمتص الملح المُحمَّص المعادن من الخيزران والطين. وهناك بعض الادعاءات أن هذا الطبق يزيد من خاصيتي منع تكسير الكروموسومات ومنع الطفرات الجينية الموجودة في طبق الدوينجانغ الكوري (عجينة فول الصويا المخمرة). \nلايحتوي ملح الكوشير على اليود على الرغم من معالجته، وحجم حباته أكبر من أغلب الأملاح المعالجة. مما قد يعطي خصائص مختلفة عند استخدامه بالطبخ، حيث يستعمل لتحضير لحم الكوشر. وليست كل المنتجات المصنفة كملح كوشير هي كذلك فعلًا بل يجب أن توثَّق من حاخام بأنها تطابق المتطلبات اللازمة لوصفها بذلك.\n\nالملح في الأطعمة\nيتواجد الملح بشكل طبيعي في كثير من المواد الغذائية كاللحوم والخضروات والفواكه، لكن بكميات صغيرة. وغالبا ما يضاف الملح للمواد الغذائية المعالجة كالأطعمة المعلبة والمخلَّلات والوجبات الخفيفة. حيث يستعمل لحفظ الطعام ولإضافة نكهة عند الأكل. تستخدم أملاح الألبان في تحضير كل من الزبدة والأجبان. كان الملح أحد أهم طرق حفظ الطعام قبل اختراع أجهزة التبريد الإلكترونية. فيحتوي سمك الرنجة 67 ملي جرام من الصوديوم لكل 100 جرام بينما يحتوي بعد تمليحه على 990 ملي جرام. وكذلك لحم الخنزير يحتوي على 63 ملي جرام بينما يحتوي بعد تمليحه على 1480 ملي جرام، أما البطاطس فيحتوي على 7 ملي جرام أما رقائق البطاطس المقلية فتحتوي على 800 ملي جرام لكل 100 جرام. إن مصادر الملح الطبيعية دون الاستعمال المباشر لكلوريد الصوديوم هي الخبز ومنتجات القمح واللحوم والحليب ومشتقاته.\nلا يضاف الملح كتوابل في كثير من دول شرق آسيا، وإنما يتم استعمال صلصة الصويا أو صلصة السمك أو صلصة المحار واللاتي يحتوين على كمية عالية من الصوديوم حيث يعدن بديلا لملح الطعام المستخدم في المجتمعات الغربية، وغالبا ما تضاف هذه الصلصات مع الطهي وليس بعده.\n\nالنظام الغذائي والصحة\nتعد كمية الصوديوم قرابة 40% من كتلة ملح الطعام، حيث يحتوي 6 جرام من الملح (ملعقة صغيرة) على ما يقارب 2300 ملي جرام من الصوديوم. للصوديوم دور مهم في جسم الإنسان حيث يساعد الأعصاب والعضلات على القيام بمهمتها بالشكل الصحيح، وكذلك يعد أحد العوامل المهمة لتنظيم الماء والسوائل داخل الجسم. يعد الملح مصدر الصوديوم الأساسي في المجتمعات الغربية، وكمية استهلاكهم للملح تعادل 10 جرام يوميًّا مما يعد أكثر من أغلب دول آسيا وشرق أوروبا. إن لمستويات الصوديوم العالية في كثير من الأطعمة المعالجة أثرًا على الكمية الكليَّة المستهلكة. حيث 77% من الصوديوم المستهلك في الولايات المتحدة مصدره وجبات المطاعم والأغذية المعالجة، و11% من إضافة ملح الطعام، أما الباقي فيكون متواجد بشكل طبيعي في الغذاء.\nيُعد الإكثار من الملح مضرًّا للصحة وتوصي منظمة الصحة العالمية بتقليل استهلاك الملح. يرتبط زيادة استهلاك الملح مع ارتفاع خطورة الإصابة بسكتة والأمراض القلبية الوعائية بشكل عام. يعد تقليل استهلاك الملح بمقدار 1000 ملي جرام مساعدًا على تقليل احتمالية الإصابة بالأمراض القلبية الوعائية بما يقارب 30%. تقليل كميات الصوديوم المستهلكة عادة بشكلٍ عالٍ في الأشخاص الذين لا يعانون من أمراض حادة يساعد على خفض ضغط الدم وتكون النتائج أفضل عند المصابين بفرط ضغط الدم. وعلى الرغم من ذلك لا توجد آثار واضحة للتوصيات بتقليل استهلاك الصوديوم.\nتوصي منظمة الصحة العالمية أن يكون استهلاك الأشخاص البالغين أقل من 2000 ملي جرام من الصوديوم يوميًّا (ما يقارب 5 ملي جرام من الملح). وتوصي إرشادات الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية لعام 2010 م أن لا يتجاوز استهلاك كل من المصابين بفرط ضغط الدم والأمريكيين من أصل أفريقي ومتوسطي العمر وكبار السن 1500 ملي جرام من الصوديوم يوميًّا وأن يكملوا احتياجات الجسم للبوتاسيوم حيث تنص التوصيات على أخذ 4700 ملي جرام يوميًّا والمتواجدة في الخضروات والفواكه.\nوإفادة تقليل استهلاك الصوديوم بشكل كبير هي مسألة مُختلف عليها. حيث يوصي تقرير لعام 2013 بألا يقلَّ استهلاك الفرد عن 1200 ملي جرام من الصوديوم يوميًّا (3 جرام من الملح). بينما ينص تقريرين لعام 2013 وعام 2015 على عدم وجود دليل كافٍ على أن تقليل الصوديوم أقل من 2300 ملي جرام يوميًّا ذا فائدة. وقد يكون النظام الغذائي ذا الصوديوم القليل أضرّ من النظام الغذائي الذي يحتوي على مستوى صوديوم مرتفع قليلًا. ويشكك البعض في الترابط بين استعمال الملح في الأكل والأمراض القلبية الوعائية عند عامة الناس.\n\nالملح في غير الأطعمة\nقرابة 6% فقط من الملح المنتج يستخدم للغذاء. أما الباقي ف 12% تستخدم في معالجة وإزالة قساوة الماء، و8% تستخدم لإزالة الجليد عن الطرقات و6% تستخدم في الزراعة. أما الباقي (68%) فيستخدم في العمليات الصناعية، حيث يعد كلوريد الصوديوم من أكثر المواد الخام غير العضوية المستعملة في الصناعة. وأهم منتجات كلوريد الصوديوم هي الصودا الكاوية والكلور، وتتم عملية فصل كلوريد الصوديوم عن طريق عملية التحليل الكهربائي لمحلول ملح نقي. وتستعمل هذه المنتجات في تصنيع كلوريد متعدد الفاينيل ومنتجات البلاستيك ولب الورق بالإضافة لمنتجات أخرى عضوية وغير عضوية. يستخدم كذلك الملح كقالب لتصنيع الألومنيوم؛ لذلك توجد طبقة من الملح الذائب تطفو فوق المعدن الذائب وتزيل الحديد والمعادن المُلوِّثة الأخرى. ويستخدم بالإضافة إلى ذلك في تصنيع الصابون والجلسرين حيث يضاف إلى وعاء لترسيب المنتجات المُتَصَبِّنَة. ويستخدم أيضًا في تصنيع المطاط الاصطناعي، والخزف حيث يتبخر الملح ويتكثف على سطح السيراميك منتجا لمعة في عملية تعرف بتزجيج الخزف.\nيُضاف الملح إلى سائل الحفر عند حفر مادة رخوة كالرمل أو الحصى لمنح دعامة ومنع ما حول الحفرة من الانهيار. يستخدم كذلك في عمليات عديدة: كترسيخ الألوان عند صبغ النسيج، وإعادة تكوين الراتنج في عملية إزالة قساوة الماء، ودباغة الجلود، وتعليب اللحوم والخضروات.\n\nالإنتاج\nيعد إنتاج الملح من أقدم الصناعات الكيميائية. وأحد أهم المصادر له هو ماء البحر الذي تساوي ملوحته تقريبا 3,5% والذي يعني أن يوجد 35 جم من الملح المُذاب لكل كجم من ماء البحر. تعتبر المحيطات مصدر ملح غير ناضب وبسبب هذه الوفرة في المصادر فإنه لم يتم حساب مخزون الملح. ويعد تبخير ماء البحر هو الخيار المثالي لإنتاج الملح للمدن الساحلية ذات مدى تبخّر عالٍ وترسب منخفض. تمتلئ الملّاحات بماء المحيطات ومن الممكن حصد بلورات الملح بعد جفاف الماء. تمتلك هذه المحاليل ألوانا بارزة نظرًا لوجود بعض أنواع الطحالب والمخلوقات المجهرية المحبة للملوحة والتي تنمو في هذه البيئة.\n\nالملح في الأديان\nلطالما كان للملح مكانة مهمة في كثير من الأديان والثقافات. يُرمى الملح عادة على النار لإصدار بعض الضجيج والفرقعة في الديانة الفيدية وفي بعض طقوس الحيثيِّين واحتفالات الساميين والإغريق عند حلول الأشهر القمرية. كان المصريون القدماء والإغريق الرومان يتقربون إلى آلهتهم بتقريب الملح والماء، ويعتقد البعض أن هذا منشأ وأصل الماء المقدس في المعتقد المسيحي. وعند الأزتيك كانت يوكسيسواتل (Huixtocihuatl) آلهة الإخصاب والتي تستجيب عند تقريب الماء والملح، كما تسمى بآلهة الملح.\nوقد روى ابن ماجه في سننه من حديث أنس بن مالك رضي الله عنه أن رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال: سيد إدامكم الملح. (ضعَّفه الألباني.)\nويعد الملح في الهندوسية مبشِّرًا وجالبا للحظ حيث كان يستعمل في بعض الطقوس الدينية وعند الزواج. أما معتنقي ديانة الجاينية فيقدمون أرزا غير مطبوخ مع قليل من الملح للآلهة كي يثبتوا مدى التزامهم بهذا الدين، وكذلك فإنهم ينثرون الملح على بقايا جثة الميت بعد حرقها قبل دفن الرماد. كما يعتقد معتنقو الماهايانية بأن الملح يطرد الأرواح الشريرة، فعند عودتهم من المقبرة ينثرون بعضا من الملح على كتفهم الأيسر لطرد هذه الأرواح ومنعها من دخول المنزل. وفي بعض الطقوس الشنتوية فإن الملح يستخدم في تطهير الأماكن والأشخاص وتوضع أكوام الملح على أطباق عند مداخل المؤسسات طردا للأرواح الشريرة وجلبا لأصحاب الأموال.\nوفي الكتاب العبري (التوراة) ذُكر الملح قرابة 35 مرة، أحدهم في قصة زوجة لوط - عليه السلام- حيث حوِّلت إلى عمود ملح عندما التفتت إلى قريتي سدوم وعمورة عند تدميرهما (سفر التكوين). وكما قام القاضي أبو معيلق عند تدميره مدينة شكيم برش الملح كلعنة على من يسكن هذه الأرض مرة أخرى. وفي سفر أيوب تم ذكر الملح للمرة الأولى كبهارات. وفي كتب العهد الجديد ذكر الملح ست مرات ويذكرون بأن المسيح أشار لأتباعه بأنهم «ملح الأرض». كما يستخدم الملح عند طرد الأرواح الشريرة، وأحيانا يُضاف للماء ويستعمل عند ترسيم الكهنة.\nوعند اليهود فيجب تواجد كل من الماء والملح عند المذبح، وفي طقوس واحتفالات أخرى.\n\nانظر أيضًا\nبدائل الملح\nمستنقعات الملح\n\n\n== مراجع ==",
          "summary": "ملح الطعام يتكون الملح المعروف بشكل رئيسي من مركب كيميائي يعرف بكلوريد الصوديوم (NaCl) والذي ينتمي لمجموعة أكبر من الأملاح. يوجد ملح الطعام في الطبيعة على هيئة بلّورات معدنية تُعرف بالملح الصخري أو الهاليت.  يوجد ملح الطعام بكثرة في ماء البحار حيث هو المُكَوِّن المعدني الرَّئيسي فيه. يحتوي المحيط على قرابة 35 جرام من الملح لكل لتر (oz 1.2) وملوحة 3.5%. يُعدُّ الملح ضروريًّا لحياة الحيوان،  ويتواجد في أنسجة الحيوانات أكثر من أنسجة النبّاتات. لذلك فإن نمط غذاء البدو المعتاد الذين يعيشون على قطعانهم لا يُحتاج فيه إلى الملح أو يُضاف بكميَّاتٍ قليلة، بينما نظام الغذاء المعتمد على القمح يحتاج إلى مكمّلات غذائية. وتعد الملوحة أحد أساسيّات حاسَّة التذوق لدى الإنسان. كما أن الملح من أقدم وأوفر التوابل، ويعد التمليح من أهم طرق حفظ الأطعمة.\nتشير بعض الأدلة إلى أن معالجة الملح تعود إلى 8000 سنة مضت، حيث كان سكان رومانيا يغلون مياه الينابيع لاستخراج الملح. كذلك عثر على أدوات لمعالجة الملح في الصين تعود إلى نفس الفترة تقريبًا. وكان يعد الملح ثمينًا عند اليهود قديمًا وكذلك عند كل من الإغريق والرومان والبيزنطيين والحيثيّين والمصريّين. أصبح الملح سلعةً ثمينةً وكان يُنقَل بالقوارب عبر البحر المتوسط من خلال طرقٍ خاصَّةٍ بُنِيَت من أجل الملح وبقوافِل عبر الصحراء الكبرى. إن عوز الملح وحاجة الدول له أدت إلى نشوء حروب بينهم، واستعماله لزيادة عائدات الضرائب. كما يستعمل الملح في طقوس بعض الأديان وفي بعض الثقافات.\nتتم معالجة الملح من خلال مناجم الملح، أو عن طريق تبخير مياه البحار أو مياه الينابيع   المليئة بالمعادن.  إن أهم المنتجات الصناعية للملح هي الصودا الكاوية والكلور.  ويستخدم في عمليات صناعية أخرى كتصنيع البوليفنيل كلورايد والبلاستيك وأكوام الورق. إن من مجمل الإنتاج السنوي للملح البالغ قرابة المئتي مليون طن يستهلك الإنسان مايقارب 6% من هذا الإنتاج فقط. بينما يُستخدم الباقي في عمليات معالجة الماء، وإزالة الجليد عن الطرقات، وفي الزراعة. يُباع الملح القابل للأكل بهيئات مختلفة كالملح البحري، وملح الطاولة (ملح الطعام) والذي يكون معالج عادة باليود للحدّ من الإصابة بنقص اليود وكذلك يحتوي عادة على مواد مضادة للتكتل. وكذلك يوجد الملح في كثير من الأطعمة المُعالجة. يُعد الملح غذاء ضروريا، وتتأثر الصحة بمدى كميته في الغذاء. \nإنّ كثرة الملح قد يزيد من ضغط الدم وزيادة احتمالية الإصابة بسكتة أو نوبة قلبية عند بعض الأشخاص. تنصح منظمة الصحة العالمية بأن يستهلك البالغون أقل من 2000 ملي جرام من الصوديوم والذي يعادل 5 جرامات من الملح يوميًّا.",
