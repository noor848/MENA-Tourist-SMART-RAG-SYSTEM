      "content": "Atar, Athra, Atash, Azar (Avestan: 𐬁𐬙𐬀𐬭, romanized: ātar) is the Zoroastrian concept of holy fire, sometimes described in abstract terms as \"burning and unburning fire\" or \"visible and invisible fire\" (Mirza, 1987:389). It is considered to be the visible presence of Ahura Mazda and his Asha through the eponymous Yazata. The rituals for purifying a fire are performed 1,128 times a year.\nIn the Avestan language, ātar is an attribute of sources of heat and light, of which the nominative singular form is ātarš, source of Persian ātaš (fire). It was once thought to be etymologically related to the Avestan āθrauuan / aθaurun (Vedic atharvan), a type of priest, but that is now considered unlikely (Boyce, 2002:16). The ultimate etymology of ātar, previously unknown (Boyce, 2002:1), is now believed to be from the Indo-European *hxehxtr- 'fire'. This would make it a cognate to Latin ater (black) and to Albanian vatër (definite form: vatra) \"hearth\", \"fireplace\", which was loaned to Romanian vatră \"hearth\", \"fireplace\", and thereafter spread to Serbo-Croat vatra \"fire\" and Ukrainian vatra \"bonfire\".\nIn later Zoroastrianism, ātar (Middle Persian: 𐭠𐭲𐭥𐭥𐭩 ādar or ādur) is iconographically conflated with fire itself, which in Middle Persian is 𐭠𐭲𐭧𐭱 ātaxsh, one of the primary objects of Zoroastrian symbolism.\n\nIn scripture\nIn the Gathic texts\nAtar is already evident in the Gathas, the oldest texts of the compendium of the Avesta and believed to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. At this juncture, as in the Yasna Haptanghaiti (the seven-chapter Yasna that structurally interrupts the Gathas and is linguistically as old as the Gathas themselves), atar is still—with only one exception—an abstract concept simply an instrument, a medium, of the Creator and is not yet the divinity (yazata) of heat and light that atar was to become in the later texts.\nIn the most ancient texts, atar is a medium, a faculty, through which judgement is passed and reflects the pre-Zoroastrian institution of ordeal by heat (Avestan: garmo-varah, heat ordeal; cf. Boyce 1996:ch. 6). Justice is administered through atar (Yasna 31.3, 34.4, 36.2, 47.2), the blazing atar (31.19, 51.9), through the heat of atar (43.4), through the blazing, shining, molten metal (ayangha Khshushta, 30.7, 32.7, 51.9). An individual who has passed the fiery test, has attained physical and spiritual strength, wisdom, truth and love with serenity (30.7). However, among all the references to atar in the oldest texts, it is only once addressed independently of Ahura Mazda. In this exception, atar is spoken of in the third person masculine singular: \"He detects sinners by hand-grasping\" (Yasna 34.4). Altogether, \"there are said to have been some 30 kinds of fiery tests in all.\" (Boyce, 2002:1)\nAlso in the early texts, tangential to its role in establishing guilt, atar is the light of revelation through which Zoroaster is selected by Ahura Mazda, the Zarathushtra Mainyu Athra (Yasna 31.3), radiated by Ahura Mazda (43.9), bearing the conviction of \"Good Purpose\"  (Vohu Manah, 43.4; see also Amesha Spenta), and enlightening one's inner-self (46.7). Within this framework of the concept of divine illumination, atar radiates the \"other lights\" (31.7), the essence (of Ahura Mazda) from which insight and wisdom permeate the universe. So also Zoroaster's injunction to always pray in the presence of atar—either towards the sun, or towards their own hearths—so as to better concentrate their devotions on asha, righteousness, and the virtue that should be striven for (Yasna 43.9, see also Boyce, 1975:455).\n\nIn later texts\nThe Gathic role of atar as the medium for detecting guilt is not directly evident in the later texts of the Avesta, but reappears in modified form as an allegory of burning and annihilating the Angra Mainyu through righteousness, \"where Asha Vahishta is identified at times with the household fire on the hearth.\" There, \"identification in the realms of matter and of spirit serves only to bring more into prominence the main tenets of Zoroaster's teachings in regard to Asha\" (Dhalla, 1938:170). A vestige of the ancient institution of ordeal by heat is nonetheless present in Vendidad 4.54–55, where speaking against the truth and violating the sanctity of promise is punishable by flogging and is detected by the consumption of \"water, blazing, of golden color, having the power to detect guilt.\" The Zend translation/commentary on this passage translates \"blazing\" as \"having brimstone and sulphur\", and notes that innocence or guilt was established by the consumption of this \"guilt-detecting liquid\". Similarly, in the Denkard, Adharbad Maraspand—the Sassanid era high-priest to whom the collation of the Avesta texts is attributed—is purported to have nine measures of \"unburning molten zinc\" applied to his chest as proof of accuracy of the sacred texts.\nSeen chronologically, the transition from atar as a vehicle of judgement to Atar Yazata the divinity presiding over blazing fire is abrupt. While the older Gathic Avestan texts have heat (and thus fire) associated with harsh judgement, the Younger Avestan texts have the divinity Atar completely representing and being represented by fire itself; and associated with warmth and light and essential for growth. Asha Vahishta's association with atar is however carried forward, and they are often mentioned together (Yasna 62.3, Nyashes 5.9, etc.). So also in their roles as protectors, for \"when the Evil Spirit assailed the creation of Good Truth, Good Thought and Fire intervened\" (Yasht 13.77).\nIt is in the later texts that Atar is personified as \"the son\" of Ahura Mazda (standard appellation, Yasna 25.7 et al.) and is addressed as \"full of glory and full of healing remedies\" (Nyash 5.6). In Yasna 17.11, Atar is \"master of the house\", recalling the role of the hearth fire in the Gathas. The same passage enumerates the \"five kinds of fire\":\n\natar berezi-savah, \"the highly beneficent atar\", qualified in Zend texts as \"the fire that eats food but drinks no water\", and the kind of fire that burns in an Atash-Behram, the highest grade of fire temple.\natar vohu-fryana, \"the atar of good affection\", cognate with bhaga and friend), later qualified as \"the fire diffusing goodness\", and \"the  fire that consumes both water and food\".\natar urvazishta, \"the atar of greatest bliss\", later qualified as \"the fire of happy life\", and \"the fire that drinks water but eats no food\".\natar vazishta, \"the atar most swift\", later qualified as the fire in clouds, i.e. lightning, and as \"the fire that neither drinks water nor eats food\".\natar spenishta, \"the atar most holy\", cognate Balto-Slavic šventas \"holy\") ( described in \"Zend\" texts as \"the fire of prosperity\" and as the spiritual fire burning before Ohrmuzd.\nThe description of the fires in the Sassanid era commentaries (the Zend texts) differs slightly from those described in the Bundahishn (\"Original Creation\", completed in the 11th or 12th century). In the latter, the description of the first and last kind of fire is reversed.\n\nIn culture and tradition\nAs a divinity\nDuring the late Achaemenid era, adar—as the quintessence of the Yazata Adar—was incorporated in the Zoroastrian hierarchy of divinities. In that position, Adar aids Asha Vahishta (Avestan, Middle Persian: Ardvahisht), the Amesha Spenta responsible for the luminaries. From among the flowers associated with the Yazatas, Adar's is the marigold (calendula) (Bundahishn 27.24).\nThe importance of the divinity Adar is evident from a dedication to the entity in the Zoroastrian calendar: Adar is one of the only five Yazatas that have a month-name dedication. Additionally, Adar is the name of the ninth day of the month in the Zoroastrian religious calendar, and the ninth month of the year of the civil Iranian calendar of 1925 (modern Persian: Azar) which has month-names derived from those used by the Zoroastrian calendar.\nIn Zoroastrian cosmogony, Adar was the seventh of the seven creations of the material universe. It is only with Adar's assistance, who serves as the life-force, that the other six creations begin their work (Bundahishn 3.7–8; more logically explained in Zatspram 3.77–83).\n\nThe cult of fire\nAlthough Zoroastrians revere fire in any form, the temple fire is not literally for the reverence of fire, but together with clean water (see Aban), is an agent of ritual purity. Clean, white \"ash for the purification ceremonies [is] regarded as the basis of ritual life\", which \"are essentially the rites proper to the tending of a domestic fire, for the temple cult is that of the hearth fire raised to a new solemnity\" (Boyce, 1975:455). For, \"the man who sacrifices unto fire with fuel in his hand, with the Baresman in his hand, with milk in his hand, with the mortar for crushing the branches of the sacred Haoma in his hand, is given happiness\" (Yasna 62.1; Nyashes 5.7) \nThe Zoroastrian cult of fire is apparently much younger than Zoroastrianism itself and appears at approximately the same time as the shrine cult, first evident in the 4th century BCE (roughly contemporaneous with the introduction of Adar as a divinity). There is no allusion to a temple cult of fire in the Avesta proper, nor is there any old Persian language word for one. Moreover, Boyce suggests that the temple cult of fire was instituted in opposition to the image/shrine cult and \"no actual ruins of a fire temple have been identified from before the Parthian period\" (Boyce, 1975:454).\nThat the cult of fire was a doctrinal modification and absent from early Zoroastrianism is still evident in the later Atash Nyash: in the oldest passages of that liturgy, it is the hearth fire that speaks to \"all those for whom it cooks the evening and morning meal\", which Boyce observes is not consistent with sanctified fire. The temple cult is an even later development: From Herodotus it is known that in the mid-5th century BCE the Zoroastrians worshipped to the open sky, ascending mounds to light their fires (The Histories, i.131). Strabo confirms this, noting that in the 6th century, the sanctuary at Zela in Cappadocia was an artificial mound, walled in, but open to the sky (Geographica XI.8.4.512).\nBy the Parthian era (250 BCE–226 CE), Zoroastrianism had in fact two kinds of places of worship: One, apparently called bagin or ayazan, sanctuaries dedicated to a specific divinity, constructed in honor of the patron Yazata of an individual or family and included an icon or effigy of the honored.  The second were the atroshan, the \"places of burning fire\", which as Boyce (1997:ch. 3) notes, became more and more prevalent as the iconoclastic movement gained support. Following the rise of the Sassanid dynasty, the shrines to the Yazatas continued to exist, with the statues—by law—either being abandoned as empty sanctuaries, or being replaced by fire altars (so also the popular shrines to Meher/Mithra which retained the name Darb-e Mehr—Mithra's Gate—that is today one of the Zoroastrian technical terms for a fire temple).\nAlso, as Schippman observed (loc. Cit. Boyce, 1975:462), even during the Sassanid era (226–650 CE) there is no evidence that the fires were categorized according to their sanctity. \"It seems probable that there were virtually only two, namely the Atash-i Vahram [literally: \"victorious fire\", later misunderstood to be the Fire of Bahram, see Gnoli, 2002:512] and the lesser Atash-i Adaran, or 'Fire of Fires', a parish fire, as it were, serving a village or town quarter\" (Boyce, 1975:462; Boyce 1966:63). Apparently, it was only in the Atash-i Vahram that fire was kept continuously burning, with the Adaran fires being annually relit. While the fires themselves had special names, the structures did not, and it has been suggested that \"the prosaic nature of the middle Persian names (kadag, man, and xanag are all words for an ordinary house) perhaps reflect a desire on the part of those who fostered the temple-cult [...] to keep it as close as possible in character to the age-old cult of the hearth-fire, and to discourage elaboration\" (Boyce, 2002:9).\nThe Indian Parsi-Zoroastrian practice of rendering the term athornan (derived from the Avestan language \"athravan\") as \"fire-priest\" in the English language is based on the mistaken assumption that the athra* prefix derives from atar (Boyce, 2002:16–17). The term athravan does not appear in the Gathas, where a priest is a zaotar, and in its oldest attested use (Yasna 42.6) the term appears to be synonymous with \"missionary\". In the later Yasht 13.94, Zoroaster himself is said to have been an athravan, which in this context could not be a reference to atar if a cult of fire and its associated priesthood did not yet exist in Zoroaster's time. Thus, in all probability, \"the word athravan has a different derivation.\" (Boyce, 2002:17)\n\nIn mythology and folklore\nIn Vendidad 1, Adar battles Aži Dahāka, the great dragon of the sky.\nIn Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, Hoshang, the grandson of the first man Gayomard, discovers fire in a rock. He recognizes it as the divine glory of Ahura Mazda, offers homage to it, and instructs his people to so as well. Also in the Shahnameh is the legend of Sevavash, who passes through \"the unburning fire\" as proof of his innocence.\n\nAs a royal symbol\nDuring the Sassanid era (226–650 CE), the symbol of Fire plays much the same role that the winged sun Faravahar did during the Achaemenid period (648–330 BCE). Beginning with Ardashir I, the founder of the Sassanid Empire, many of the kings of the dynasty issued one or more coins with a symbol of Fire on the verso, and seals and bullae with the fire symbol were common. \nThe first silver coins of the empire have helmeted busts of Ardashir I (r. 226–241) or his father Papak on the obverse (a figure of the ruling monarch on the obverse is consistent throughout the dynasty), with a representation of a fire altar, accompanied by the legend atash i artakhshir, \"Fire of Ardeshir\", on the reverse. Ardashir's son, Shapur I (r. 241–272), has much the same image but adds two attendants at the fire altar. On the coins of Hormizd I (also known as Ardashir II, r. 272–273), the emperor himself tends the fire with the help of an attendant. Bahram II (276–293) also appears himself, accompanied by what may be his queen and son. Narseh (r. 293–303) also attends the fire himself, this time alone.  On the coins of Shapur III (r. 383–388), a divinity appears to be emerging from the fire. The shape of the fire altar in the coins of Yazdegerd II (r. 438–457) are similar to those in present-day fire temples. The legend introduced under Ardeshir yields to a mint mark and year of issue under Peroz (r. 457–484), a feature evident in all the coins of the remaining dynasty.\n\nIn technology\nAtar is the name of a French jet engine, developed and produced by the SNECMA company.\n\nSee also\nAban, \"the waters\", which is of similar importance to Zoroastrianism.\nThe Gathas, the most sacred texts of the Avesta\nYazatas and Amesha Spentas as Zoroastrian divinities\nDedication to Adar in the Zoroastrian calendar\nAgni\nLuminiferous aether\nEitr, original substance of the original being, Ymir, in the old Norse cosmology\nEternal flame\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nDhalla, Maneckji Nusservanji (1938).

      "content": "## Overview\nAtar is a town of 25,000 people (2013) in Saharan Mauritania. It is a great base for exploring the Adrar region, and tends to be slightly cheaper overall than Chinguetti. The Atar Mosque, one of the oldest mosques in the country, dates from 1674.\n\n## Understand\nAtar is growing in importance due to its proximity to an airport and a regional hospital.\n\n## Climate\nAtar has a hot desert climate typical of the Sahara Desert, south of the tropic of Cancer. The weather is usually very hot, very sunny and very dry but it can be overcast sometimes. The annual average temperature is close to 30 °C (86 °F), meaning that excessive heat persists year-round. The annual mean rainfall amount is very low, averaging no more than 35 mm and it mainly falls in August and in September while the sunshine duration is high, at over 3,540 hr of bright sunshine yearly.\n\n## By plane\n20.506667-13.0430561 Atar International Airport (Mouakchott Airport ATR  IATA). Used to be served by a daily flight from Marseille, France but there are only small charter flights available due to the kidnappings in other parts of Mauritania.\n\n## By train\nThe Iron Ore Train typically departs from Nouadhibou sometime between 14:30 and 22:00, depending when the cargo is finished loading. There is only one train a day with passenger cars and tickets can be arranged in advance or bought at the Nouadhibou train station (Gare Voyageurs) for around 1,500 ouguiyas. Travel in the bucket wagons is free, just climb aboard, but it will be cold and dusty. The train stops at Choum where you can easily grab a ride to Atar in one of the many bush taxis or pickups which will meet the train for around 1,500-2,000 ouguiyas.\n\n## By road\nThere is a paved and fast road which runs from Nouakchott to Atar served by a variety of minibuses (including one run by a kindly French ex-pat) and bush taxis. All of the rides going to Atar tend to leave Nouakchott from the Garage Atar at the end of town. Typical fare is around 4000 ouguiyas.\n\n## Get around\nAtar is quite small and can easily be walked, although some auberges and resorts lie quite far out of town. Taxis are available and can usually be caught around the traffic circle in the centre of town, fares are around 100-300 ouguiyas depending on distance.\n\n## See\nAtar has a few markets which may be of interest to the souvenir hunter and prices tend to be lower than Chinguetti, and bargaining is expected.\n20.51707-13.052991 Musée Universitaire Atar, Rue Wilaya (next to BAMIS). 09:00-13:00, 16:00-18:00. Museum with displays on local culture.    (updated Sep 2018)\n\n## Buy\nGalerie Artisanale Chez Picasso, Route vers Choum. Souvenir shop selling the usual Mauritanian and African items. (updated Sep 2018)\nLa Boutique d'Adrar pour la Fabrication Traditionnelle et les Météorites, Rue Wilaya. Souvenir shop with a selection of meteorite rocks and other geological curiosities from the region. (updated Sep 2018)\n\n## Eat\nRestaurant Agadir. In the center of town, it serves typical Moroccan fare for around 600 ouguiyas a plate.\nRestaurant De la Coin. A little harder to find, this hole-in-the-wall Senegalese restaurant dishes out plates at around 300 ouguiyas.\nAuberge Bab Sahara. On the pricier end, try a home-cooked lunch (from 700 ouguiyas) or dinner (3,500 ouguiyas for a 3-course menu)\n\n## Drink\nThe occasional beer can be found at Auberge Bab Sahara.\n\n## Sleep\nFor its size, Atar contains a good number of auberges, hotels and resorts.\nThe Auberge Bab Sahara (about a km outside of town on the road to Choum). Has rooms ranging from mattresses on one of two terraces to a number of traditional tents or stone huts. Plentiful bathroom and shower facilities (including hot water). The hospitality of the owners is genuine and they will gladly help arrange bush taxis or tours. Terrace/Tent spots start at 2,000 ouguiyas (1500 for students and cyclists) and 5,000 for huts..\n\n## Connect\nElmejd Info (south of the NP petrol station). The only internet cafe in town. (updated Sep 2018)\n\n## Go next\nBush taxis (taxis brousses) or 4x4s to Choum, Chinguetti, Terjit, or Nouakchott can be arranged in the Garage, the market or at most hotels.\nMany of the oases and other natural sites in the region can be seen in day trips leaving from Atar. Ask around at your hotel/auberge to arrange bush taxis, 4x4s, or rent bikes. If you're feeling adventurous, wander into the market and you will doubtless get offers of obliging drivers ready to show you what they consider to be the most interesting sites.\nSome of the notable sites in the region include oases (Terjit, Mhaireth), dunes (Valle Blanche, Amatlich), and old towns (Azougi, Chinguetti).",
