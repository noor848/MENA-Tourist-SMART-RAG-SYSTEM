      "content": "Nouakchott ( nwa(h)k-SHOT) is the capital and largest city of Mauritania. Located in the southwestern part of the country, it is one of the largest cities in the Sahara. The city also serves as the administrative and economic center of Mauritania.\nOnce a mid-sized coastal village, Nouakchott was selected as the capital for the nascent nation of Mauritania, with construction beginning in 1958. It was originally designed to accommodate a population of 15,000, but experienced significant population growth in the 1970s when many Mauritanians fled their home villages due to drought and increasing desertification. Many of the newcomers settled in slum areas of the city that were poorly maintained and extremely overcrowded. By the mid-1980s, Nouakchott's population was estimated to be between 400,000 and 500,000.\nAs of 2023, the city had a population of nearly 1.5 million people and serves as the hub of the Mauritanian economy. It is home to a deepwater port and Nouakchott–Oumtounsy International Airport, one of the country's two international airports. It also hosts the University of Nouakchott and several other more specialized institutions of higher learning.\n\nHistory\nNot too long ago, Nouakchott was a small fishing town, having been a fortified fishing village (ksar) in pre-colonial times and under French rule. As Mauritania prepared for independence, it lacked a capital city. The area of present-day Nouakchott was chosen by Moktar Ould Daddah, the first President of Mauritania, and his advisors. Ould Daddah desired the new capital to symbolize modernity and national unity, which ruled out existing cities or towns in the interior. The village was selected as the capital city for its central location between Saint-Louis, Senegal, the city from which the colony of Mauritania was governed, and Nouadhibou. The village of Nouakchott was originally inhabited by the tribe of Bouhoubainy who are of Amazigh origin and are native to it. They have since been moved to different settlements notably Aknodert which is situated between Nouakchott and the International Airport. One of the intentions of choosing this location was to avoid the sensitive issue of whether the capital was built in an area dominated by the Arabs and Amazigh (Berbers) or Sub-Saharan Africans.\nConstruction began in March 1958 to enlarge the village to house a population of 15,000, in 1959 Nouakchott started with its founding by indigenous people from the surrounding region, and the basics were completed by the time that the French granted independence on 28 November 1960. Nouakchott was planned with the expectation that commerce and other economic activities would not take place in the city. Nouakchott's central business district was planned with broad streets and a grid-like structure; the new Cinquième Quartier (Fifth District) was located close to this area and became the location of a large open-air market and residential area within a few years. During the 1960s, the city obtained its own local government. By the 1970s, these new areas had grown so much that they replaced the old ksar in terms of importance, as they also hosted the governmental buildings and state enterprises.\nThe city was attacked twice in 1976 by the Polisario Front during the Western Sahara conflict, but the guerrillas caused little damage. The city has had massive and unconstrained growth, driven by the North African drought, since the beginning of the 1970s; hundreds of thousands moved there in search of a better life. The official censuses showed 134,000 residents in 1977 and 393,325 in 1988, although both figures were probably smaller than reality. The population is now estimated to consist of at least one third of the country's population of 3.3 million, and the 2013 census showed a population of 958,399.\n\nGeography\nLocated on the Atlantic coast of the Sahara Desert, it lies on the west coast of Africa. With the exception of Friendship Port and a small fishing port, the coastal strip is mostly left empty and allowed to flood. The coastline includes shifting sandbanks and sandy beaches. There are areas of quicksand close to the harbor. Nouakchott is largely flat, and some of the city lies below sea level. It is threatened by the sand dunes advancing from its eastern side which pose a daily problem. There have been efforts to save particular areas, including work by Jean Meunier. Owing to the rapid build-up, the city is quite spread out, with few tall buildings. Most buildings are one-story.\nNouakchott is built around a large tree-lined street, Avenue Gamal Abdel Nasser, which runs northeast through the city centre from the airport. It divides the city into two, with the residential areas in the north and the medina quarter, along with the kebbe, a shanty town formed due to the displacement of people from other areas by the desert. Other major streets are named (in French) for notable Mauritanian or international figures of the 1960s: Avenue Gamal Abdel Nasser, Avenue Charles de Gaulle, Avenue Kennedy, and Avenue Lumumba, for example.\nThe kebbe consists of cement buildings that are built overnight and made to look permanent to avoid destruction by the authorities. In 1999, it was estimated that more than half of the city's inhabitants lived in tents and shacks, which were used for residential as well as business purposes. The city is broken into nine arrondissements, sub-divided into alphabetized Îlots. These are Teyarett, Ksar, Tevragh-Zeïna, Toujounine, Sebkha, El Mina, Dar-Naïm, Arafat and Riad. The Sebkha (Cinquième) Arrondissement is home to a large shopping area.\n\nClimate\nNouakchott features a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh) with hot temperatures throughout the year but cool winter night temperatures. Due to the city's oceanside location, Nouakchott is generally not quite as hot as other cities with the same climate. Still, the city can experience sweltering days. While average high temperatures are relatively constant at around 33 °C (91 °F), average low temperatures can range from 25 °C (77 °F) during the fall months (in this city fall is hotter than summer, with September and October being the hottest months) to 13 °C (55 °F) during the winter months. Minimum temperatures can be as low as 10 °C (50 °F) during winter nights in Nouakchott. Average rainfall in the city is 95 mm (3.7 in) a year.\n\nClimate change\nA 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a \"moderate\" scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~2.5–3 °C (4.5–5.4 °F) by 2100, the climate of Nouakchott in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Khartoum. The annual temperature would increase by 2.3 °C (4.1 °F), and the temperature of the warmest month by 2.8 °C (5.0 °F), while the temperature of the coldest month would decrease by 0.3 °C (0.54 °F). According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with 2.7 °C (4.9 °F), which closely matches RCP 4.5.\n\nSustainability\nResponding to a 450% projected increase in electricity demand between 2010 and 2030, Nouakchott's Sheikh Zayed solar power plant was completed in 2012 and is considered the largest solar power plant in Africa. The desert climate causes dust accumulation, which negatively impacts the performance of photovoltaic solar panels.\n\nGovernment\nNouakchott is divided into three administrative regions (wilayat) led by governors appointed by the central government, each of which contains three departments (moughataa):\n\nNouakchott-Nord (Nouakchott-North): Dar-Naim, Teyarett, Toujouonine\nNouakchott-Ouest (Nouakchott-West): Ksar, Sebkha, Tevragh-Zeina\nNouakchott-Sud (Nouakchott-South): Arafat, El Mina, Riyad\nSeparate from the wilayat, a directly elected regional council was established in Nouakchott in 2018, which took over the roles of promoting social and economic development from the Urban Community that it replaced. Fatimatou Abdel Malick was elected Council president in September 2018, and re-elected in May 2023.\nNouakchott was initially divided into four departments in 1973. In 1986 the current nine departments were created.\nFormerly a district, in 1990 Nouakchott became a region of Mauritania. On 25 November 2014, it was split into the three current regions, with the previous governor of Nouakchott Mahi Ould Hamed becoming the first governor of Nouakchott-Nord.\n\nDemographics\nFor comparison, its population was only 20,000 in 1969. Part of the difficulty in estimating the city's population is that part of it is nomadic, setting up tents in suitable locations, then packing up when the need strikes. Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million. The 2013 census gave the city's population as 958,399.\n\nSlum resettlement\nIn 2009, the government of Mauritania announced that it would begin a process of clearing the slum on the outskirts of Nouakchott, as 24,000 families would eventually be relocated to planned housing in the city. The process was scheduled to begin with the relocation of 9,000 families from the outskirts into the poor Arafat department neighborhood of \"Kosovo\", popularly named for its high crime rate and poor services. The government planned to begin moving families in June 2009, despite concerns from aid agencies that needed infrastructure could not be put in place in the receiving neighborhood.\nIn 2013, it was reported that \"slums have been replaced by social dwellings for the poorest\" The World Bank reported that the plan met with substantial success; it resulted in access to improved services for 181,035 people in the slum areas. Now in 2023 the population is approximately 1.5M people.\n\nEconomy\nNouakchott is the center of the Mauritanian economy, with three-quarters of service sector enterprises located in the city as of 1999 with 90% of the city's economic activity consisting of informal transactions. The Capital downtown area is home to the headquarters of multiple major national banks and companies and the site of a cluster of open-air markets.\nThe city is the focus of many modernization and foreign investment projects, with two five-star hotels finishing construction in 2024.\n\nTransport\nNouakchott has a Chinese-built deepwater port that opened in 1986. It was designed for a capacity of 500,000 tons deadweight (DWT) of cargo a year, but has been handling 1,500,000 tons (DWT) by 2009. China agreed in 2009 to invest US$282 million in the port, aiming to extend the main quay by over 900 m (3,000 ft). As of 2011, the World Bank was investigating funding a new shipping container facility at the port.\nAir service is provided by Nouakchott–Oumtounsy International Airport, which replaced the previous Nouakchott International Airport in June 2016.\nThe Cairo–Dakar Highway leg from Nouakchott to Nouadhibou was paved in 2004, although the Nouakchott-Rosso leg was paved before independence. A 1,100-kilometre (680 mi) road (Route de l'Espoir (Road of Hope)) connects the city with Néma via Boutilimit and Kiffa. In the city, there is a public transport and commuter system, with vehicles serving major boulevards.\nIn July 2022, a tramway project was presented; it does not have a scheduled opening date.\n\nEducation\nThe city is home to the University of Nouakchott Al Aasriya, the main university in Mauritania, opened in 1981. As of 1995, it had 70 professors and 2,800 students. Other higher education facilities include the Lebanese International University of Mauritania, the National School of Administration, the College of Science and Technology and the Higher Scientific Institute.\nPublic schools in Nouakchott are dispersed throughout the city, while private schools are concentrated in middle and upper-class districts. Among the most prominent international schools for citizens and expats alike are the American International School of Nouakchott, the Lycée Français Théodore Monod, and TLC International School.\n\nCulture\nAttractions in Nouakchott include the National Museum of Mauritania, the National Library, the Port de Pêche, and the National Archives. The city hosts several markets, including the Marocaine market and the beaches. One beach is devoted to fishing boats where fish can be bought fresh at the Fish market. Nouakchott is a principal selling place of native Saharan meteorites.\n\nPlaces of worship\nNouakchott, like the rest of the country, is populated by a Sunni Muslim super-majority, and mosques are extremely common in neighborhoods. The Saudi Mosque and Masjid Ibn Abbas are the most notable, due to their grand architecture and size.\nThere are also few Christian churches and temples: the most well-known is the Cathedral of Saint Joseph in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nouakchott (Catholic Church).\n\nSport\nNouakchott hosts ten of the fourteen teams of the Mauritanian Super D1 as of the 2023–2024 season, including ACS Ksar, AS Douanes, AS Garde Nationale, ASAC Concorde, ASC Police, ASC Tidjikja, FC Gourel Sangue, FC Tevragh-Zeina, Kaedi FC, and Nouakchott Kings.\n\nTwin towns – Sister cities\nNouakchott is twinned with: \n\n Al-Quds, Palestine (2012)\n Amman, Jordan (1999)\n Lanzhou, China (2000)\n Madrid, Spain (1986)\n Oujda, Morocco\n\nSee also\nList of cities in Mauritania\nEconomy of Mauritania\nTransport in Mauritania\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nArmelle Choplin et Riccardo Ciavolella, 2008. \" Marges de la ville en marge du politique ?

      "content": "نُوَاكْشُوط أو انواكشوط هي عاصمة موريتانيا وأكبر مدنها، قدر عدد سكانها عام 2013 بـ 958 ألف نسمة. في عام 1957 اختيرت منطقة نواكشوط الساحلية لتصبح العاصمة للدولة الجديدة. تعد واحدة من أكبر المدن في الصحراء الكبرى، والمركز الإداري والاقتصادي في موريتانيا. وتقع على خطي 18°و 6' شمال، 15° و 57' غرب. وضع المختار ولد داداه (أول رئيس لموريتانيا) والرئيس الفرنسي حينها شارل ديغول الحجر الأساس للعاصمة في 5 مارس 1958 لتتحول نواكشوط سريعًا من قرية صغيرة (200-300 نسمة) وسط صحراء موحشة تفتقر لمياه جوفية صالحة للشرب، وتعاني نقصًا حادًا في مياه الأمطار، إلى أهم مدينة في موريتانيا، وكان ذلك قبيل استقلال البلاد بثلاث سنوات لكي تكون عاصمة الدولة الناشئة.\n\nالتاريخ\nتعود أول آثار السكن البشري بالمنطقة إلى العصر الحجري. وقد استقرت بها قبائل من السود قادمة من الجنوب ومن الشرق وتشكلت أول تجمعات سكانية في موريتانيا على سواحل الأطلسي في قرى تسمى قرى «ايمراغن» كانت نواكشوط إحداها حسب رأي بعض الباحثين، في حين يرى آخرون أن الأمازيغ كانوا الأسبق في المنطقة.\n\nالتاريخ القديم\nفي الألفية الأولى قبل الميلاد هاجرت قبائل بربرية قادمة من شمال أفريقيا إلى المنطقة وهيمنت على السكان السود. وجلبت هذه القبائل معها الجياد والجمال التي سهلت التبادل التجاري. ثم في الألفية الأولى بعد الميلاد حل بربر صنهاجة بالمنطقة المطلة على المحيط وسيطروا على الطرق التجارية الصحراوية.\n\nدخول الإسلام\nفي بداية من القرن الثالث عشر اجتاحت قبائل عربية البلاد. ثم في القرن السادس عشر استقرت قبائل بني حسان العربية بموريتانيا وقد جاءت من مصر العليا لكنها واجهت معارضة شديدة من القبائل البربرية التي تمت السيطرة عليها في النهاية. في القرن الحادي عشر، كان دخول الإسلام موريتانيا ما يعرف سابقاً ببلاد شنقيط جزءا مغموراً من الدولة الإسلامية مُنذ العهد الأموي، ولم يعتنِ به المؤرخون كثيرا، ولعل السبب هو البعد وضعف عناية أهل البلد بالكتابة عن أنفسهم، مع أن الإسلام وصل إلى تلك البلاد في أواخر القرن الأول الهجري، ويحدد بعضهم ذلك التاريخ بسنة 63 هـ، وقيل كان في بداية القرن الثاني على رأي من يحدده بسنة 112 هـ، فيقول ابن خلدون: في كتابه العبر متحدثاً عن القائد عقبة بن نافع وفتوحاته: «ودخل المغرب الأقصى وأثخن في المصادمة ودوخ بلادهم حتى حملهم على الإسلام ثم جاز إلى السوس لقتال من بها من صنهاجة أهل اللثام فأثخن فيهم وقاتل مسوفة وراء السوس وقفل راجعا» ، والسوس مكان معروف يقع وراء: تارودانت ويصب في المحيط الأطلسي من بلاد موريتانيا حاليًا.\nوقيل أن عقبة هو الذي وقف على شاطئ المحيط الأطلسي وأدخل جواده حتى بلغ الماء نحره ثم قال: «اللهم إني أشهدك أن لا مجاز ولو وجدت مجازا لأجزت»، وظل أهل تلك البلاد من ذلك التاريخ مسلمين، وإن مرت بهم فترات يحملون فيها الإسلام بضعف، وكانت أول دولة إسلامية قامت على جزء من هذه الأرض هي دولة غانا (في القرن الرابع الهجري) التي كانت عاصمتها كومبي صالح في شرق موريتانيا حالياً، وكان للمسلمين العرب صلة بها، يقول محمود شاكر: «ويبدو أن أحد الأشراف قد وصل إلى إمبراطورية غانا، وأسس مدينة كومي صالح التي أصبحت عاصمة تلك الإمبراطورية … وكانت قد توسعت هذه الإمبراطورية حتى شملت أراضي موريتانيا اليوم» ، ثم دولة مالي التي قامت سنة 638 والتي شملت الأجزاء الشرقية من موريتانيا الحالية.\nوفي عام 427 هـ خرج «يحيى بن إبراهيم الكدالي» حاجا في طائفة من قومه وفي طريق عودته مر على القيروان فالتقى بشيخ المالكية بها أبو عمران الفاسي وبعد مناقشة بينهما قال له الشيخ: «ما يمنعكم من تعلم الشرع على وجهه والأمر بالمعروف والنهي عن المنكر؟» فقال له: «لا يصل إلينا إلا معلمون لا ورع لهم ولا علم بالسنة عندهم» وطلب يحي من الفقيه أن يرسل معه مستشارا ومعلما من خيرة تلاميذته فكلف بذلك «وجاج بن زلوم اللمطي» الذي وقع اختياره على عبد الله بن ياسين الجزولي وكان حازما وعالما بالسياسة.\n\nقيام الدولة الإسلامية\nبعد عودة يحيى ومعه عبد الله بن ياسين دخل البلاد فترة انتشار الإسلام، فبدأت بالتعليم والدعوة فوجد الرجلان بداية نفرة وصعوبة في ذلك فاتخذا معسكرا أطلق عليه اسم «الرباط» وسمي كذلك لما فيه من مرابطة على العبادة والتدريب، وكان في جزيرة على البحر بين نواكشوط ونواذيبو في مكان معروف اليوم باسم: «تيدرة» ووضعا نظاما تدريبا قويا، وظل أنصارهم يتزايدون، وبعد عشر سنوات تكونت لديهما جماعة قوية فعم صيتها وكثر أتباعها وعند ذلك أعلنوا الجهاد، وفتحوا المدن وأخضعوا القبائل، وظل نفوذهم يمتد ويتسع؛ فاحتلوا درعة وسجلماسة وأودغست، وفي أثناء حصار هذه المدينة قتل يحيى بن إبراهيم، فعينوا بعده يحيى بن عمر اللمتوني، ثم قتل عبد الله بن ياسين في المعركة التي دارت بينهم وبين قبيلة «برغوطة» ثم بنوا مراكش فجعلوها عاصمة لهم، ووجهوا قوتهم إلى الشمال بعد ما ضعف نفوذهم في الجنوب حتى وصلوا إلى الأندلس مما جعلهم يؤخرون سقوط الأندلس قرابة أربعة قرون من الزمن، وكان لهذه الدولة الإسلامية صلات قوية بالدول والمماليك الإفريقية، «فهذه البلاد كانت المركز الذي تربت فيه حركة المرابطين واندفعت منه تنشر الإسلام في نواحي كثيرة وتحمي الإسلام بالأندلس من زحف الفرنجة» وعندما جاء الإسلام إلى هذه المنطقة قدر لها أن تلعب دورا كبيرا في تاريخ الإسلام، وأن تصبح مركزا وهاجا ينشر هذا الدين ويذود عنه في الشمال والجنوب، ومن أجل هذا ينبغي أن نفسح المجال لدراسة تاريخ الإسلام في هذه المنطقة المهمة.، ولما توفي يحي خلفه أخوه أبو بكر وابن عمه يوسف بن تاشفين، وبدأ بهما ملك المرابطين الذي اتجه نحو الجنوب حتى بلاد السنغال، كما اتجه نحو الشمال حتى ضم إسبانيا والذي بدأ التجييش له بقرب مدينة نواكشوط الحالية.\n\nالعصور الوسطى\nكانت نواكشوط جزءاً من إمارة الترارزة، إذ انها كانت قرية صغيرة نائية يعيش سكانها على صيد السمك من المحيط وقد تعاقب على هذه المنطقة مجموعات محلية كان آخرها مجموعة صغيرة من البيضان لم يساهم تواجدها في فك العزلة عن القرية إذ لم تعتبر آنذاك سوى منطقة نائية يستخدمها بعض المتدينين للانعزال والتعبد.\n\nبناء نواكشوط\nكانت موريتانيا جزء من مستعمرة غرب أفريقيا الفرنسية، ولذا لم يكن لها عاصمة أثناء فترة الاستعمار، حيث كانت سانت لويس هي عاصمة المستعمرة. ولكن في عام 1957 اختيرت منطقة نواكشوط الساحلية لتصبح العاصمة للدولة الجديدة وذلك بعد أن سمح السكان الأصليون لتلك المنطقة للرئيس المختار ولد داداه بعد طلبه رسميا لهم. واختير موقعها ليتوسط موريتانيا بين الشمال والجنوب، وتم البدء بمشروع إعمار طموح لزيادة عدد سكانها ليصل إلى 15 ألف نسمة. وفي عام 1958، أصبحت موريتانيا منطقة حكم ذاتي ضمن السيطرة الفرنسية، وفي عام 1960، تم حل هذا الشكل من السيطرة الفرنسية وأصبحت نواكشوط عاصمة لدولة مستقلة.\nوقد تم اختيار المدينة لتكون عاصمة وذلك لمناخها المعتدل وموقعها المركزي في البلاد.\nانتقلت إليها الحكومة الموريتانية بعد أن كان مقرها سان لويس على نهر السنغال في جنوب موريتانيا.\nلم تكن «نواكشوط» ترتبط في السابق بأي قيمة حضارية أو ثقافية في الوجدان الشعبي الموريتاني على خلاف العديد من المدن التاريخية الأخرى مثل شنقيط في الشمال وولاتة في الشرق وهو ما جعل الجدل بشأن اختيارها عاصمة للجمهورية الوليدة لا يتوقف، إذ يعتبره كثيرون مؤامرة فرنسية لمنع ارتباط الدولة الحديثة بأي قيمة تاريخية للمجتمع الموريتانيوقد قيل أن الرئيس الأول لموريتانيا المختار ولد داداه قال بأن اختيار نواكشوط كعاصمة كان موفقا لكونها تقع قرب الرباط الذي أقامه مؤسسو دولة المرابطين قبل أكثر من ثمانية قرون.\n\nالتاريخ الحديث\nبعد بناء العاصمة وتركيز مختلف الادارات والخدمات بها ازداد عدد السكان إلى 15 ألف في ظرف 5 سنوات كان أغلبهم من أسر الكوادر الإدارية والتعليمية والعمال المحليين إضافة إلى أفراد السلك الأمني والجيش والشرطة المنتدبين حديثاً. وقد أدّى الجفاف الذي ضرب البلد في سبعينيات القرن العشرين إلى تدفق مئات الأسر باتجاه العاصمة الوليدة وهو ما ضاعف بشكل كبير وسريع أعداد السكان. وقد هاجمت «جبهة البوليساريو» المدينة في عام 1976، كجزء من حركة استقلال الصحراء الغربية. بين عامي 1988-1989، تصاعدت التوترات العرقية بين بين العرب والسود. كان هناك تمييز وانتقام بين العرب والسود. بالإضافة إلى ثلاثة أيام من «مظاهرات الخبز» بدأً من 21 يناير 1995.\nوقد شهدت المدينة نموّاً سريعاً، بعد ذلك بسبب الجفاف في شمال أفريقيا الذي اشتدت وطأته في بداية عقد 1980. فانتقل العديد من السكان إلى المدينة المبنية حديثاً بحثاً عن حياة أفضل. قُدر عدد السكان تحت مليون نسمة في عام 2000، ونمت إلى مليوني نسمة في عام 2008.\nهناك حاليّاً عدد كبير من الصينين، يركّزون على الإستثمار في المدينة.\n\nالجغرافيا\nتقع نواكشوط على ساحل المحيط الأطلسي من الساحل الغربي لأفريقيا. يُعد الشريط الساحلي للمدينة فارغاً، باستثناء مرسى نواكشوط وميناءها، الذي يسمح بحدوث فيضانات. يشمل الشريط الساحلي رمال متحركة وشواطئ رملية. وهناك أيضا مناطق رملية مُتحركة على مقربة من الميناء. وتغطي الكثبان الرملية المدينة القادمة من الجهة الشرقية (كما يظهر في الصورة المجاورة)، والتي تُشكل مُشكلة يوميّاً. هُناك جهود كبيرة لإنقاذ مناطق معيّنة. أما المدينة فيغلب عليها الشكل المسطح.\nبُنيت نواكشوط حول شارع عبد الناصر الذي يمتازُ بالأشجار الكبيرة على جانبيه، ويمتد شمال شرق البلاد من خلال مركز المدينة من المطار. تتم تسمية الشوارع الرئيسية الأخرى باللغة الفرنسية أقتداءً بشخصيات موريتانية أو دولية بارزة من العقد 1960، على سبيل المثال: شارع عبد الناصر وشارع شارل ديغول وجادة كينيدي، وشارع لومومبا.\nتقع العاصمة في الجنوب الغربي لموريتانيا تعتبر أرضها سبخة وشديدة الملوحة، وهي بعيدة عن مصادر المياه العذبة كما لا يوجد جبال قريبة منها يمكن استخدام أحجارها في البناء، أما الساحل فهو غير مناسب كثيراً ليكون ميناء طبيعي، فقد كان ضحلا يصلح للصيد.\nأما اليوم فإن المياه الجوفية التي في الصخور العميقة تحت نواكشوط توفر للمدينة حاجاتها من المياه، ولنواكشوط رصيف ميناء بحري يصل للمياه العميقة. وتشكل المدينة مركز تجمع سكاني يعتبر من الأكبر في منطقة الصحراء الكبرى إذا استثنيت المدن الواقعة على أطراف الصحراء كالقاهرة في وادي النيل والمدن شمال جبال أطلس.\nلكن المدينة تعاني من خطر الغرق، لأن أغلب أحيائها تقع تحت مستوى مياه المحيط الأطلسي. ومن المفارقات أن أحياءها الشرقية والشمالية الشرقية تواجه خطراً بيئيا مُغايرا، وهو الرمال الزاحفة التي لم تفلح محاولات الحكومة في وقفها، أو وضع حد لتقدمها السريع نحو المباني والمنشآت السكنية.\n\nالتقسيم الإداري\nتم تقسيم المدينة لأول مرة إلى أربعة مقاطعات في عام 1973. من عام 1986، قُسمت المدينة إلى تسع مناطق: وتنقسم إداريا الآن إلى 3 ولايات هي:\n\nالأقدم من بين أحياء العاصمة، وعرفات الأكثر كثافة سكانية، وتيارت والسبخة والميناء والرياض وتوجنين ودار النعيم.\nمن أهم معالم المدينة: المسجد الجامع القديم، المسجد السعودي، مسجد المغرب، آفاركو، دار الثقافة، الملعب الأولمبي، معرض الصناعات التقليدية، الميناء القديم، ملتقى طرق مدريد.\n\nالمناخ\nتتميز نواكشوط بمناخ صحراوي «مع صيف حار وشتاء دافئ». وبسبب موقعها، تكون درجات الحرارة عالية جدًا في معظم السنة. ومع ذلك، تمتازُ نواكشوط بامتلاكها درجات حرارة مُعتدلة بالمقارنة مع مدن أخرى من هذا النوع من المناخ. في حين أن متوسط درجات حرارة عالية وثابتة نسبيًا عند حوالي 32 درجة مئوية (89.6 درجة فهرنهايت)، يمكن أن يتراوح متوسط درجات الحرارة المنخفضة بين 24 درجة مئوية (75.2 درجة فهرنهايت) خلال أشهر الصيف إلى 13 درجة (55.4 درجة فهرنهايت) خلال فصل الشتاء. يمكن أن يبلغ متوسط درجات الحرارة المُنخفضة 10 درجة مئوية (50.0 درجة فهرنهايت) خلال أشهر «الشتاء» في نواكشوط. يبلغ متوسط هطول الأمطار في المدينة 159 ملليمترا (6,3 إنش) في السنة. الجزء الأكبر من الأمطار تسقط عادة في شهر أغسطس، وهو الشهر الذي يشكل موسم الرطب القصير جدًا في المدينة.\n\nالسكان\nعلى سبيل المقارنة، كان عدد سكانها 20,000 نسمة فقط في عام 1969 و 150,000 في عام 1980. وجزء من صعوبة تقدير عدد السكان هو الترحال. تُشير التقديرات نفسها أن عدد سكان المدينة بلغ 800,000 نسمة، وتشكل بالتالي ثُلث سكان البلاد، ووفقًا لبعض التقديرات إلى أن العدد أكثر من مليوني نسمة.\nوقد ساهمت سنوات الجفاف والتصحر التي ضربت البلاد في السبعينات والثمانينات في تسريع عملية تحضر مجموعات البدو واتجاههم إلى مدينة نواكشوط وغيرها من المدن، حيث انخفضت نسبة السكان البدو والرحل من 73,3% عام1965 إلى 11% عام 1991 وإلى 4,8% عام 2000.\nتتعدد الأعراق التي تسكن نواكشوط بين العرب والأفارقة والأوروبيين من المهاجرين المستوطنين للمدينة في فترات مختلفة، والسياح وعمال الشركات الأجنبية التي تستثمر في موريتانيا (وغالبيتهم من فرنسا وإسبانيا)، والآسيويين (الصين وكوريا) الوافد الجديد نظراً لانفتاح موريتانيا على الصين وماليزيا، أما عرب نواكشوط هم من سكان موريتانيا الأصليين ويمثلون الأغلبية من سكان موريتانيا من أصول عربية وبربرية وأوروبية مختلطة، واسر من شرق الوطن العربي هاجرت في الستينيات والسبعينات من القرن العشرين (لبنانيون، فلسطينيون) بالإضافة إلى جاليات عربية: تونسيون وسوريون وفلسطينيون وجزائريون ومصريون ومغربيون. والأفارقة وهم الموريتانيون من أصول أفريقية إضافة إلى جاليات أفريقية أخرى غالبيتهم من أفريقيا الغربية (السنغال، مالي، غانا، غامبيا، كوت ديفوار، نيجيريا).\n\nالاقتصاد\nتتواجد في نواكشوط عدة شركات لصناعة المنتجات الغذائية والأسمنت ومبيدات الحشرات والسجاد والتطريز والمنتجات الحرفية، كما يصدر النحاس عبر ميناء المدينة. وفي سنة 2000، لم يكن هناك أكثر من 30 مصنع صغيرة ومتوسطة الحجم في المدينة. وتوجد شركات إدارية ومالية مهمة. شركة موريتانيا للطيران ومقرها في المدينة. قبل أن تُغلق الخطوط الجوية الموريتانية كان مقرها في نواكشوط أيضاً.\n\nالبنية التحتية\nالمواصلات في نواكشوط\nتمتلك نواكشوط شبكة طرق داخلية بطول 250 كلم منها 50 كلم طرق سريعة. يجري حاليّاً مشروع لإنجاز 130 كلم من الطرق الداخلية في نواكشوط ستنتهي أشغاله قريبا.\nتعد نواكشوط ملتقى أهم المحاور الطرقية في موريتانيا وأهمها:\n\nالطريق السريع الوطني رقم 1 في اتجاه نواذيبو والحدود المغربية 500 كلم.\nطريق الأمل في اتجاه مدينة النعمة 1200 كلم.\nطريق اطار-نواكشوط 450 كلم.\nطريق نواكشوط-روصو في اتجاه مدينة روصو والحدود السينغالية 200 كلم.\n\nالمياه\nمنذ تأسيسها سنة 1960 كانت المدينة تلبي حاجيات سكانها من المياه عن طريق بحيرة اديني الجوفية 60 كلم شرق نواكشوط لكن نظراً لتضاعف عدد السكان وازدياد الضغط على بحيرة اديني الجوفية لم تعد هذه الأخيرة كافية لتلبية احتياجات السكان من المياه الصالحة للشرب مما أدى إلى ازمة مياه سنوات 2005-2006 تم إجراء عدة دراسات لحل المشكل وانتهى الأمر بالحكومة الموريتانية إلى تبني مشروع أفطوط الساحلي يهدف هذا المشروع إلى تلبية حاجيات مدينة نواكشوط من المياه حتى أفق 2030 عن طريق سحب مياه نهر السنغال (200 كلم) جنوب نواكشوط، تم تدشين المشروع سنة 2010 معلنا القضاء على أزمة العطش في نواكشوط نهائيا وقد كلف المشروع حوالي 750 مليون دولار.\n\nالكهرباء\nتعتمد نواكشوط على محطات تعمل بالفيول والديزل الثقيل لتوليد الكهرباء وتقدر الطاقة الإجمالية المتوفرة في المدينة سنة 2011 ب 120 ميغاوات ويقدر الطلب ب 100 ميغاوات يرتفع إلى 140 ميغاوات في الصيف\nتقوم شركة بتروناس الماليزية حاليا بإنشاء محطة كهرباء بقدرة 700 ميغاوات تعمل بالغاز لتلبية حاجيات نواكشوط والقرى المجاورة سيتم تدشينها سنة 2014 تزامنا مع انتهاء أشغال تطوير حقل بندا للغاز ويهدف هذا الشروع إلى توفير الكهرباء بأسعار زهيدة لأغراض منزلية وصناعية.\n\nالصرف الصحي\nتعاني من غياب شبه كامل لشبكة الصرف الصحي نظراُ لعشوائية توسع المدينة وفقط 20% من أحياء نواكشوط لديها صرف صحي. وقعت الحكومة عقدا بقيمة 199 مليون دولار مع شركة غزوبا غروب الصينية لتوسيع شبكة الصرف الصحي لتشمل جميع أحياء نواكشوط تستمر الأشغال لمدة 5 سنوات.\n\nالثقافة\nرغم الصعوبات الاقتصادية، فإن المدينة تضم حركية ثقافية هامة، فتتعدد بها المعارض التشكيلية ومعارض الفنون الجميلة والتصوير والنحت والعروض المسرحية والحفلات الموسيقية المتواصلة على مدار السنة على الرغم من قلة البنى التحتية اللازمة لذلك ومحدودية دور العرض ودور الأوبيرا والمدرجات الكبيرة. وتتم أكثر هذه النشاطات في فضاءات مثل دور الشباب وسط العاصمة أو المراكز الثقافية الأجنبية أو الملاعب الرياضية وحتى في الهواء الطلق.\nوتستضيف المدينة مهرجانات سينمائية تعرض وتقيم الأفلام المنتجة محلياً وإقليمياً أبرزها «مهرجان نواكشوط السينمائي» الذي تنظمه كل عام مؤسسة «دار السينمائيين الموريتانيين». كما تستضيف المدينة مهرجانات شعرية أهمها «مهرجان موريتانيا الشعري» السنوي للشعر العربي باللغة الفصحى وعدة مهرجانات أخرى للشعر باللهجات المحلية.\n\nالتعليم\nالمدينة هي موطن لجامعة نواكشوط، هي الجامعة الوحيدة في موريتانيا، وتأسست في عام 1981. يبلغ عدد طلاب الجامعة حوالي 8,000 طالب، تضم الجامعة أربعة كليات وهن كلية الآداب والعلوم الإنسانية وكلية العلوم القانونية والاقتصادية وكلية العلوم والتقنيات وكلية الطب، وللجامعة تأثير كبير على المدينة. تشمل مرافق التعليم العالي الأخرى المدرسة الوطنية للإدارة، والمعهد الوطني للدراسات الإسلامية المتقدمة، والمدرسة العليا متعددة التقنيات، والمعهد العالي للإدارة والمحاسبة، والمدرسة الوطنية العليا لعلوم الصحة. وهناك العديد من المدارس الابتدائية والثانوية، من بين أبرز هي المدرسة الأمريكية الدولية في نواكشوط، وثانوية تيودور مونو الفرنسية الأولى كما بنيت جامعات جديدة هي الأولى من نوعها في ضاحية نواكشوط.\n\nالرياضة\nالسياحة\nشاطئ نواكشوط يعد من أجمل الشواطئ المطلة على المحيط الأطلسي، كما أن مُناخ المدينة المُعتدل يُساعد على زيارة الشاطئ خصوصاً في الصيف حيث ترتفع درجات الحرارة.\nيجذب السياح في نواكشوط منشآت تشمل المتحف الوطني للعاصمة، والعديد من الأسواق بما في ذلك سوق الفضة، والشواطئ. ويخصص واحد على الشاطئ قوارب الصيد حيث يمكن شراء أنواع مختلفة من الأسماك الطازجة. وتستضيف المدينة أيضا المكتبة الوطنية والأرشيف الوطني. وتعتبر نواكشوط الموقع الرئيسي الذي تنطلق منه رحلات الخبراء والسياح والمستكشفين المهتمين بعلم الفلك في أفريقيا إذ ان موريتانيا هي المكان الرئيسي لتوزيع العالم من النيازك في أفريقيا وفي الصحراء القريبة منها.\nكما تحتوي على مساجد من أضخمها مسجد تبرعت بتكاليف بنائه المملكة العربية السعودية وسمي باسمها في وسط المدينة، ومسجد المغاربة جنوبا. وعلى الرغم من أن الإسلام هو دين الدولة في موريتانيا، فإن نواكشوط بها كاتدرائية القديس يوسف، وهي كاتدرائية كاثوليكية فهي موطن لأبرشية الروم الكاثوليك في نواكشوط، وقد تأسست في عام 1965.\n\nمعالم

      "content": "Nouakchott (en arabe : نُوَاكْشُوط) est la capitale de la Mauritanie depuis 1957 (auparavant la capitale était Saint-Louis). Située au bord de l'océan Atlantique, elle a été créée sur une zone de campement. De temps à autre, les nomades viennent séjourner autour de Nouakchott qui a pris rapidement l'aspect d'une ville moderne.\n\nToponymes\nLe nom de cette ville, Nouakchott est d'origine berbère et signifie « fait de bâtons », pour parler des habitations faites de bois, néanmoins Noiakchott selon les retranscriptions, a donné lieu à plusieurs traductions, dont cinq principales :\n\n« lieu où apparaît l'eau quand on creuse un puits » ;\n« terrain où les coquillages abondent » ;\n« l'endroit au pâturage salé » ;\n« là où souffle le vent » ;\n« le sans-oreilles ».\nChott peut signifier « plage » ou « estran ». Noua en arabe hassaniya (dialecte maure) serait « baie ». On traduirait littéralement « Nouakchott » par « la plage de la baie ». Bien que le littoral mauritanien ne présente aucune baie aux abords de Nouakchott, la forme de la côte y est légèrement creuse. Nouakchott était à l'origine un camp militaire français, construit de toutes pièces, où les Mauritaniens n'avaient pas l'habitude de séjourner.\n\nPaysage urbain\nLe centre-ville est formé selon un plan hippodamien structuré autour de deux boulevards.\nL'artère principale est l'avenue Abdel Nasser orientée est ouest, qui se termine à six kilomètres à l'ouest au port et passe d'abord à l'est à travers un vaste quartier de bâtiments gouvernementaux et relie le centre à l'aéroport international situé à trois kilomètres au nord-est.\nL'avenue du Général de Gaulle traverse une zone résidentielle à l'extrême nord, puis le quartier des affaires et des ambassades et mène au sud de l'intersection principale à travers plusieurs quartiers de marché jusqu'au Cinquième arrondissement au sud.\nL'ancien village de Ksar a fusionné avec ce qui est aujourd'hui l'arrondissement de Ksar à l'est duquel se trouve l'ancien aéroport de la ville.\nLa division originale ne comprenait que quatre arrondissements. En 1986, la ville est divisée en neuf arrondissements officiels.\nLes neuf arrondissements, constituant des communes urbaines administratives, sont :\n\nHistoire\nVers 1960, ville nouvelle\nL'endroit en lui-même est connu depuis longtemps par les nomades. Au début du XXe siècle, il ne consiste encore qu'en un poste militaire, érigé par l'armée française en 1903. Dans un récit de voyage intitulé Vent de sable, écrit en 1923, Joseph Kessel évoque « le pire endroit de la côte » tenu par « quinze tirailleurs sénégalais et un sergent corse ». Pour Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, qui y pose de temps en temps l'avion de l'aéropostale, c'est un « petit poste de Mauritanie, aussi isolé de toute vie qu'un îlot perdu en mer ». Il s'agit d'un ksar, c'est-à-dire un fortin, entouré de quelques campements, où un détachement de militaires français surveille la route commerciale qui relie le Maroc au Sénégal.\nLe développement de Nouakchott commence véritablement avec le vote de la Loi-cadre des territoires d'outre-mer, dite Loi-cadre Defferre, de juin 1956, qui institue pour chaque territoire un conseil de gouvernement présidé par un gouverneur et composé de ministres élus par l'assemblée territoriale. Il faut une capitale à la Mauritanie et on décide alors la création d’une ville nouvelle en ce lieu. À cette époque, il y a 500 habitants sur place. L'endroit est choisi en raison de la proximité de la nappe phréatique d'Idini, qui peut permettre de desservir une ville importante, et pour sa situation centrale, qui permet de créer un lien entre les Maures blancs du Nord et les populations noires du Sud du pays. Le climat est également plus doux qu'à l'intérieur des terres. En 1959, l'architecte français André Leconte dresse le plan de la nouvelle capitale. Deux noyaux se dégagent : l'un autour du fort, qui deviendra le quartier européen de nos jours ; l'autre autour de la mosquée, donc un peu plus à l'écart à l'époque. Coupée en deux dans un premier temps, la ville se réunifie rapidement. En 1958, Amadou Diadié Bâ, ministre mauritanien des Ponts et Chaussées procède à la pose de la première pierre pour la création de la capitale de la Mauritanie en ce lieu. Il prononce à cette occasion un important discours en présence du général Charles de Gaulle et du président mauritanien Mokhtar Ould Daddah. Cette cérémonie officielle a été à l’origine de la transformation du fort, et du ksar en une véritable capitale d'un pays africain. La première pierre qu'Amadou Diadié Ba a posée en compagnie des chefs d’États français et mauritanien est toujours visible dans la cour de la Présidence de la république. Un hôpital, un aéroport et une avenue sont édifiées. Puis, l'année de l'indépendance, en 1960, d'autres bâtiments surgissent dans le quartier du Ksar : la première mosquée, les premiers ministères, le wharf ou zone portuaire et enfin des blocs cubiques destinés à loger des fonctionnaires.\n\nLe développement est assez rapide. Les estimations donnent une population de 8 000 habitants en 1960 et de 800 000 habitants environ à la fin du XXe siècle. Les raisons de cette importante croissance démographique sont :\n\nle regroupement vers le chef-lieu dans les lieux désertiques ;\nl'emballement : plus un lieu concentre d'habitants, plus il en attire de nouveaux ;\ndans les années 1980, à la suite d'une grande sécheresse qui ruine les éleveurs (première richesse du pays), ceux-ci viennent s'installer en ville pour trouver un nouvel emploi.\n\nL'habitat et le logement informel sont des phénomènes courants dans les pays en voie de développement et les pays du monde arabo-musulman. Nouakchott en est un exemple, même si les particularités de l'habitat spontané ne peuvent être généralisées à l'ensemble des pays arabes. Le cas de Nouakchott est un cas extrême en ce qui concerne l'habitat informel parce que le phénomène y est massif.\n\nExplosion urbaine\nNouakchott se trouve à la frontière de deux aires culturelles : la Mauritanie ne fait partie ni du monde arabe au sens strict – des populations dites négro-africaines Soninkés, Toucouleurs et Wolofs peuplent le sud du pays – ni de l'Afrique noire, car les Maures (se réclamant d'ascendance berbère ou arabe) qui parlent le dialecte hassanya ou le berbère sont la principale ethnie dans le pays et à Nouakchott. La ville se trouve donc aux marges du monde arabe.\n\nPour donner un autre ordre de grandeur, entre 1962 et 1990, la superficie de la ville est passée de 240 à 8 000 hectares, et la population a été multipliée par 81 entre 1959 et 1988.\nLes causes de l'explosion urbaine sont d'ordre à la fois économiques, sociologiques et psychologique :\n\nun processus de sédentarisation couplé à une croissance démographique importante (démographie de transition) ont entraîné une émigration importante des villages aux villes. En effet, le milieu naturel mauritanien ne permet pas une forme d'agriculture capable de nourrir et de faire travailler l'ensemble de sa population. Le milieu est essentiellement saharien ou sahélien (hormis aux abords du fleuve Sénégal), et l'agriculture mauritanienne repose essentiellement sur un modèle agro-pastoral (avec un nomadisme développé). La fragilité du milieu naturel ne pouvait donc pas absorber la croissance démographique ;\nde plus, le colonialisme avait déjà en partie remis en cause les valeurs qui permettaient le nomadisme, fondé sur l'autorité des chefs. Les sécheresses des années 68 à 73 ont accéléré de manière spectaculaire la sédentarisation : les seules possibilités de se prémunir contre la famine résidaient alors dans les villes (distribution de nourriture, soins...), et les nomades une fois sédentarisés étaient peu disposés à repartir vers les zones rurales. Cette sécheresse a ruiné les éleveurs et réduit fortement la production céréalière pour quelques années ;\non peut aussi ajouter différentes motivations à l'émigration vers les villes, notamment l'attrait que la ville constitue pour l'ensemble de la population (emplois, accès à l'éducation et à la santé, meilleures conditions de vie...), cela est d'autant plus vrai pour Nouakchott qui est une capitale aux fonctions politiques, administratives et culturelles (administration, justice, armée, enseignement...).\nLa population urbaine représente 6,4 % de la population totale en 1962, et Nouakchott représente alors 0,6 % de la population. Quelques décennies plus tard, au début du XXIe siècle, Nouakchott représente désormais à elle seule entre 25 et 30 % de la population mauritanienne. Pour donner une idée de ce changement en profondeur de cette société mauritanienne, le nomadisme est passé, entre 1962 et 1985, de 75% à 15% environ de la population (tendance encore accentuée aujourd'hui mais les données précises manquent).\n\nClimat\nNouakchott a un climat désertique chaud (BWh selon la classification de Köppen).\nLa température moyenne annuelle est de 25,8 °Cet les précipitations annuelles sont de 159 mm.\n\nHeures de lumière du jour\n\nDémographie\nDepuis 1961, l'évolution démographique de Nouakchott a été :\n\nUne partie de la difficulté d'estimer la population de la ville est qu'une partie de celle-ci est nomade, installant des tentes dans des endroits appropriés, puis pliant bagage lorsque le besoin s'en fait sentir.\nCertaines estimations évaluent la population de 2008 à plus de 2 millions.\nLe recensement de 2013 a donné la population de la ville à 958 399.\n\nÉconomie\nNouakchott connait un développement inégal et certaines parties de la ville restent fortement sous-développées. \nLa ville abrite plusieurs marchés, dont le marché marocain et les plages.\nOn peut acheter du poisson frais sur le marché aux poissons d’une plage consacrée aux bateaux de pêche.\nNouakchott est un lieu de vente principal de météorites sahariennes.\nLa ville abrite la cimenterie Mafci, du groupe italien Italcementi.\n\nCulture\nEspaces culturels\nMusée national de Mauritanie.\nBibliothèque nationale de Mauritanie.\nPalais des Congrès à Nouakchott.\n\nLangues\nLa langue arabe est parlée par une grande majorité des habitants de la ville, surtout le dialecte arabe local (Hassanya). D'autres langues nationales sont aussi parlées à Nouakchott, il s'agit du pulaar, du wolof et du soninke.\nEn 2014, 50,7 % des habitants de Nouakchott de 15 ans et plus savent lire et écrire le français tandis que 49,4 % savent le parler et le comprendre.\n\nÉducation\nÉcoles primaires et secondaires\nIl existe de nombreuses écoles primaires et secondaires, parmi les plus importantes figurent le Lycée Français Théodore Monod et l'American International School of Nouakchott et le lycée d’Excellence de Nouakchott.\n\nEnseignement supérieur\nLa principale université de Mauritanie, l’Université de Nouakchott Al Aasriya, a été fondée en 1981.\nParmi les autres établissements d'enseignement supérieur figurent l'Université libanaise internationale en Mauritanie, l'École nationale d'administration, l'École normale supérieure de Nouakchott, l'Académie Navale, le Collège des sciences et de la technologie et l'Institut scientifique supérieur.\n\nFormation militaire\nÀ proximité de l'université se trouvent l'école d'état-major mauritanienne et le Collège de défense G5 Sahel, destinés à former des officiers supérieurs.\n\nTransports\nTransport maritime\nPort de pêche\nÀ six kilomètres à l'ouest du centre-ville se trouve le port de pêche ou plage des Pêcheurs, ainsi nommé car les bateaux de pêche sont tirés côte à côte sur la plage de sable, sur une ligne longue de plus d’un kilomètre. La côte droite, non protégée, est exempte de jetée. Si les pêcheurs sont, pour la plupart, des Wolof du Sénégal, d'autres viennent des pays voisins comme la Gambie ou la Guinée. Les prises sont débarquées dans la journée, principalement en fin d'après-midi, et vendues à la criée dans une poissonnerie.\nPort industriel\nLe port industriel est au sud du port de pêche. En 1966, la première installation portuaire a été mise en service à sept kilomètres au sud-ouest du centre-ville. Le port a été conçu pour un volume d'échanges de 50 000 tonnes par an. Au début des années 1970, la capacité a été portée à 200 000 tonnes pour expédier le minerai de cuivre de la zone minière d'Akjoujt. Avec un nouvel agrandissement en 1977, le Port a atteint une capacité de 320 000 tonnes. Des entreprises industrielles ont commencé à s'installer autour du port.\nPort en eau profonde\nNouakchott n'avait pas de port en eaux profondes, elle dépendait donc des approvisionnements terrestres par les ports sénégalais. Les relations économiques avec la république populaire de Chine ont commencé en 1967 lorsque Moktar Ould Daddah, lors de sa visite d'État en Chine, a reçu un engagement pour un prêt initial de cinq millions de dollars américains et une offre pour 200 tonnes de matériel agricole. Ceux-ci pouvaient être déchargés via la première jetée, mise en service un an plus tôt. En 1974, le président mauritanien a convenu avec la Chine de construire un port en eau profonde de 37 millions de dollars près de la ville, qui, une fois achevé en 1986, est devenu le plus grand projet de construction chinois en Afrique après la liaison ferroviaire Tanzanie-Zambie (TAZARA).\nLa première pierre du nouveau port est posée en avril 1979 ; lors de son inauguration le 17 septembre 1986, le Port Autonome de Nouakchott (PANPA) est surnommé Port de l'Amitié. Situé a 15 km au Sud-Ouest de la ville de Nouakchott, le Port dispose d'un quai de 585 mètres de long. Les principales importations du port industriel sont le ciment, le blé, le sucre, le maïs, le lait et les produits finis de toutes sortes. De nombreuses marchandises sont destinées du Mali et sont ensuite acheminées par camion par la Route de l'Espoir. Les principales exportations sont le gypse (50 000 tonnes en 2008) de la Société Arabe des Industries Métallurgiques (SAMIA), en provenance d'un bassin minier entre Nouakchott et Akjoujt. Le port a été conçu pour une capacité de 500 000 tonnes de port en lourd (DWT) de fret par an, mais a traité 1 500 000 tonnes (DWT) en 2009.\nEn 2009, la Chine a décidé  d'investir 282 millions de dollars supplémentaires dans le port. En 2011, la Banque mondiale a étudié le financement d'une nouvelle installation de conteneurs maritimes dans le port. Le Port de Nouakchott peut recevoir un tonnage théorique maximal de 7.000.000 tonnes, 170000 conteneurs et 684 navires. En 2019, la Chine investit dans les industries de transformation des produits de la pêche.\n\nTransport fluvial\nLe fleuve Sénégal est le fleuve qui sépare la Mauritanie du Sénégal. La société des bacs à Rosso couvre les opérations fluviales sur le fleuve Sénégal le long de la Frontière entre la Mauritanie et le Sénégal. Elle opère actuellement à deux niveaux:\n\nPassage au niveau de Rosso avec deux bacs de 80 tonnes.\nLa capacité de chargement maximale est de 80 tonnes, mais l'équipe d'inspection technique permet un plafond de 70-75 tonnes. La dimension de la plate-forme est de 20 mètres sur 8 mètres. La navette dure normalement de 30 à 40 minutes pour traverser les 800 mètres qui séparent les deux rives.\nIl y a un accord entre les deux pays, le Sénégal et la Mauritanie, avec des navettes quatre fois par jour.\nPassage au niveau de Kaédi avec un bac en bois pour la traversée des voitures.\n\nTransport aérien\nL’Aéroport international de Nouakchott-Oumtounsy a remplacé l'ancien aéroport international de Nouakchott en juin 2016 donnant lieu a une nouvelle assiette foncière au centre-ville. Celle-ci ayant permis le financement du nouvel aéroport.\n\nTransport routier\nLes liaisons routières principales de Nouakchott sont:\n\nN3 Axe Nouakchott – Néma. Longue de 1 100 kilomètres, la Route de l'Espoir relie Nouakchott à Néma via Boutilimit et Kiffa.\nAxe Nouakchott – Kaédi, 418 km asphaltés.\nN1 Axe Nouakchott – Akjoujt – Atar, longue de 440 km, et au Sahara occidental à travers le désert.\nN2 Nouakchott-Rosso, 204 km, asphaltée, menant à Saint-Louis, Sénégal\nAxe Nouakchott-Nouadhibou, 470 km, asphaltée, menant au Sahara occidental.\nDes minibus neufs, climatisés, assurent les liaisons Nouakchott-Nouadhibou et Nouakchott-Atar. De même, des compagnies de bus ont vu le jour, desservant, au départ de Nouakchott, Atar, Nouadhibou, Kiffa, Néma et Kaedi.\nAu niveau intra-urbain, 68km de routes sont prévus pour l'amélioration de la circulation dans le cadre du volet Voirie du Programme d'urgence pour le développement de Nouakchott.\n\nTransport local\nEn ville, les taxis, nombreux et en général dans un état de fatigue avancé, sortent rarement de la zone urbaine. Les tarifs pratiqués sont sensiblement les mêmes que vous preniez une Renault 12 en cours d'émiettement ou une Mercedes 200 d'arrivage. Si vous en louez un à la journée, mieux vaut choisir un véhicule en bon état. Les Sénégalais, facilement reconnaissables aux quantités de décorations très kitsch qu'arborent le pare-brise et le tableau de bord, ont tendance à bien entretenir, voire à chouchouter, leurs bagnoles et apprécient l'autoradio.\nOn peut aller absolument partout en Mauritanie avec des taxis-brousse, mais il faut savoir qu'ils ne sont pas toujours en bon état et qu'ils n'hésitent pas sur le remplissage. Si vous ne voulez pas arriver complètement rétréci et si vous avez le budget, n'hésitez pas à payer plusieurs places ou à prendre le siège avant (plus cher).\nIl existe deux sortes de taxis-brousse : sur le goudron, les Peugeot break qui prennent jusqu'à 9 personnes en plus du chauffeur (deux devant, quatre au milieu et trois à l'arrière) ; sur le goudron et les pistes, on trouve les 4x4Toyota ou Nissan Patrol. Ces derniers sont moins chers que les Peugeot mais tout aussi pleins. Le prix varie selon que vous êtes en cabine, protégé mais serré, ou à l'extérieur, à l'arrière du pick-up, cheveux au vent.\nLe principe du taxi collectif est de partir lorsqu'il est plein. Sur certains trajets, on risque donc d'attendre (quelques heures ou quelques jours), à moins d'acheter les places non remplies.\nPrévoir de l'eau, un foulard, ainsi qu'une couverture si l'on voyage à l'arrière.\n\nLieux de culte\nParmi les lieux de culte, il y a principalement des mosquées musulmanes. Il y a aussi des églises et des temples chrétiens : Diocèse de Nouakchott (Église catholique), églises protestantes et églises évangéliques.\nLes mosquées les plus connues, construites après l'indépendance, sont la mosquée Ibn Abbas construite en 1963 et considérée comme la plus ancienne mosquée de Nouakchott, celle dite « marocaine », dont l'architecture ne manque pas de rappeler la Koutoubia de Marrakech, et la mosquée appelée « saoudienne », un édifice imposant aux minarets élancés offert par l'Arabie saoudite.\n\nSport\nFootball\nLes clubs suivants sont basés à Nouakchott (11 des 14 clubs participant au championnat de Mauritanie de football sont y situés) : \n\nASC Mauritel ;\nASC Al Nasr de Sebhka ;\nASC Armée ;\nASAC Concorde ;\nASC El Ahmedi FC ;\nASC Entente FC ;\nASC Garde nationale ;\nACS Ksar ;\nASC Police ;\nAMSME El Mina ;\nFC Nouadhibou ;\nChemal FC.\n\nStade olympique de Nouakchott\nInauguré en 1983, le Stade olympique de Nouakchott est le plus grand stade de Mauritanie avec une capacité de 10 800 places. Celui-ci est principalement à accueillir l'équipe nationale de football et recevoir différentes rencontres sportives importantes. Il est également doté d'une piste d'athlétisme.\n\nStade Cheikha Ould Boïdiya\nConstruit entre 1968 et 1969, le Stade Cheikha Ould Boïdiya (anciennement Stade de la capitale jusqu'en 2012) dispose d'une capacité de 8 200 places assises et d'une pelouse naturelle. Souvent utilisé par la sélection nationale mauritanienne ou pour de grandes rencontres internationales comme la coupe d'Afrique des Nations des moins de 20 ans 2021, il a été également conçu pour les matchs de la ligue mauritanienne dont les clubs n'ont pas encore les moyens de disposer de leurs propres stades.\n\nPersonnalités nées à Nouakchott\nMoustapha Ould Ahmed Ely, universitaire et homme politique\nEly Ould Mohamed Vall, militaire, ancien chef de l'État (1953-2017).\nMohamed-Salem Ideidbi, Dr en Droit de la Sorbonne, Écrivain-Chercheur\n\nUrbanisme\nLe développement de la ville\nLe développement de la ville de Nouakchott se fait le long de certains axes, de manière discontinue.\n\nLa ville s'est étendue vers le sud et l'est de manière assez importante (les vides ont été comblés), il est assez probable que les zones d'habitats informels (kébbés) aient été repoussées vers les périphéries et que les kébbés soient devenus des zones d'habitats évolutives.\nLe noyau de la ville est constitué du ksar, noyau originel de Nouakchott, et du quartier du marché (médina) séparés par la cité administrative (ministères, présidence). C'est « le Nouakchott que tout le monde connaît ». Cet ensemble, qui est la jonction entre l'ancien ksar et la partie de la ville ayant la fonction de capitale, a été construit avant 1975. Ce noyau est bordé par une zone d'habitat de moyen standing qui était au départ prévue pour accueillir l'ensemble des fonctionnaires de la cité administrative. Il était prévu d'y construire des habitats collectifs (barres de trois étages maximum) pour les loger. Une première vague de 200 logements a été construite, mais les fonctionnaires les plus aisés et les expatriés ont rapidement quitté ces barres pour des quartiers plus agréables à vivre (nord-ouest, résidentiel de haut standing). Cette forme d'habitat a été délaissée, mal utilisée (familles nombreuses), et le projet abandonné.\nL'habitat de moyen standing est plutôt classique pour un pays musulman. Comparable à l'habitat de la médina, il évolue souvent en même temps que la famille et ses revenus (agrandissements successifs), sur une base carrée ou rectangulaire, parfois avec une cour carrée au milieu.\nLes zones dites d'habitat évolutif (ou Gazra) et de kébbé sont les zones d'habitats informels ou d'anciens habitats informels. Ce sont les zones produites par l'explosion urbaine de Nouakchott et la périurbanisation (extension des espaces périurbains).\nLe kébbé est la zone par excellence de l'habitat informel : c'est le nom de ce que l'on nomme globalement bidonville. Ce sont des quartiers d'habitats spontanés sous-intégrés. Le terme de kébbé viendrait du mot hassanya (langue arabo-berbère) signifiant « ordure ».\nL'habitat évolutif est l'habitat basé sur l'évolution de certains kébbés légalisés par les autorités. On les appelle aussi Gazra. Ces anciens kébbés ressemblent à de véritables quartiers par un processus de consolidation et de construction, grâce à certains des occupants qui cherchent à valoriser ces zones. Ils bénéficient par la suite d'un meilleur accès à l'eau, aux transports, à l'éducation et à la santé qui sont les problèmes récurrents des kébbés.\n\nParticularités du logement informel à Nouakchott\nLes kébbés de Nouakchott ont des particularités spécifiques.\nLes bidonvilles sont des zones d'habitats sous-intégrés d'habitats spontanés : non prévus par les plans d'urbanisme et illégaux.\n\nCes quartiers constituent souvent une zone de transition entre la ville au sens propre et l'espace rural d'où proviennent les populations de ces quartiers. C'est particulièrement vrai pour les kébbés qui, en plus de cela, conservent certaines traces du nomadisme.\nEn effet, les kébbés sont l'agglomération de plusieurs espaces fonctionnels contigus délimités ou non par un enclos. Les abris se résument souvent à la baraque (matériel de récupération) ou à la tente (persistance d'une culture nomade), parfois les deux en même temps.\nKébbé type : tente, baraque, coin cuisine, enclos à animaux :\n\ntente pour les heures les plus chaudes de la journée (pratique cependant en recul) ;\nbaraque pour dormir, coin cuisine à l'extérieur ;\nprésence d'animaux dans un enclos ou vaquant librement autour, mal nourris. C'est une ressource d'appoint pour les familles.\nCes ensembles forment un enchevêtrement dense et inorganisé : c'est un quartier anarchique où l'on passe où l'on veut, entre les tentes et les baraques.\nLes constructions en dur sont rares (à cause de la situation juridique précaire de ces habitats).\nLe mode de vie du kébbé est symbolique de la transition du modèle agropastoral dominant en Mauritanie, au mode de vie urbain. Cette solution transitoire est parfois préférée à l'installation dans les unités standardisées, préfabriquées des constructions étatiques (même si ce modèle est limité à Nouakchott par l'absence de moyens étatiques). Les kébbés sont aussi les lieux d'une culture à la croisée des chemins : métissage des cultures peule, toucouleur, wolof avec la culture maure, malgré une tendance à la séparation de la ville en quartiers ethniques facilement explicable par le fait qu'un nouveau venu s'installe d'abord près des gens qu'il connaît ou qui ont la même origine.\n\nIl y a une réelle corrélation entre les habitants de ces quartiers et ceux des quartiers dits d'habitat évolutif et l'économie informelle qui constitue l'un des principaux moyens de subsistance (commerce de rue, emplois non déclarés, micro-entreprises non déclarées, travail à domicile...). [La notion de chômage a peu de sens dans les PED]\nL'extension de la ville s'est faite par l'extension non contrôlée des kébbés, seule solution pour les populations émigrées et défavorisées arrivant à Nouakchott pour résoudre le problème du logement via l'économie.\nCette extension non contrôlée de la ville a longtemps été la règle, la prise de conscience de ce phénomène d'extension massive de l'habitat informel a été relativement tardive et longtemps considérée par les autorités comme due à une situation conjoncturelle.\nCe n'est qu'à partir de 1974 que les autorités, face au risque de « bidonvillisation » généralisée de la ville, ont pris la mesure de la chose.\n\nDonnées\nLes estimations les plus récentes (basées sur des chiffres de la fin des années 1980, début 1990) concernant l'habitat informel à Nouakchott font état de 37 à 42 % (I. Sachs) de la population vivant dans des quartiers illégaux de type kébbés, et d'environ un autre tiers de la population qui vivrait dans des quartiers certes légaux mais dénués d'équipement. Mais la proportion d'habitants vivant dans les kébbés a été par moments, proportionnellement, plus importante que cela (durant les années suivant les sécheresses de 68-73).\nLes principaux problèmes de ces quartiers sont ceux de l'accès à l'eau, capitale dans cette région, de la desserte en transports (goudronnage des routes), ainsi que l'accès à l'éducation, à la santé...\nLa résorption de l'habitat précaire reste un enjeu pour les autorités et les habitants.\n\nL'habitat informel mène à des conditions de vie difficiles : insalubrité, risques sanitaires (maladies), insécurité sociale (risque d'expulsion), surexposition aux dangers naturels (pour Nouakchott, les inondations et les tempêtes de sable).\nOn peut assez aisément dire que la résorption de cet habitat précaire est importante pour l'amélioration des conditions de vie des habitants.\n\nTentatives de mise en place de politiques d'urbanisme\nLes politiques envisageables pour résorber l'habitat précaire :\nPour résorber l'habitat spontané et stopper la bidonvilisation de la ville, les autorités ont à leur disposition une palette de politiques différentes.\nParmi les politiques envisageables : le déguerpissement envisagé et appliqué au début des années 1980. Pourtant, face à la généralisation des kébbés, les politiques ont préféré préserver la paix sociale et envisager des solutions plus consensuelles.\nLa construction immobilière :\n\nPar des investissements publics accompagnés d'un certain volontarisme d'État… se heurte aux réalités mauritaniennes et au manque de moyens étatiques ;\nPar des investissements privés, comme dans les pays pétroliers… cela suppose un dynamisme économique que Nouakchott n'a pas (en tout cas pas selon les critères de l'économie mondialisée).\nVague de régularisation quartier par quartier des parcelles occupées illégalement, solution largement employée à Nouakchott créant un enjeu autour du foncier et de la notion de propriété (qui était au départ relativement étrangère aux populations rurales), et de nombreuses spéculations, profitant plutôt aux plus aisés (seuls à pouvoir construire sur les terres accordées par l'état).\nLutte contre la centralité : cette politique est parfaitement envisageable pour remédier aux problèmes de Nouakchott. Création de villes nouvelles, meilleure distribution des ressources entre les villes pour les rendre plus attrayantes aux candidats à l'émigration et soulager ainsi Nouakchott.\nLutte contre la macrocéphalie urbaine de Nouakchott. Cela ne semble pas être une option envisagée pour Nouakchott, le PDU (programme de développement urbain entré en vigueur le 30 avril 2002 et qui doit durer jusqu'au 30 juin 2009) lancé par la Banque mondiale consacre 54 millions de dollars rien que pour Nouakchott sur les 70 millions initialement accordés pour la Mauritanie (le montant réel sera plus proche de 85 millions de dollars compte tenu de la baisse du dollar).\nIl y a tout un ensemble d'autres mesures possibles, mais cependant moins utilisées dans cette partie du monde, exemple des ONG. La question des ressources allouées à ces politiques reste récurrente.\nLa gestion de l'habitat précaire et de l'expansion de la ville par les autorités à Nouakchott :\nL'État est le principal acteur de la politique d'urbanisme en Mauritanie car c'est le seul possesseur de la terre. En effet, depuis la création de l'État Mauritanien, celui-ci a cherché à s'approprier la terre en dépossédant les tribus qui fondaient leur droit à la terre sur la coutume (pas de propriété telle qu'on l'entend chez nous). Ce processus d'appropriation de la terre par l'État s'est terminé en 1983.\nPour devenir propriétaire en Mauritanie, il faut obtenir une autorisation d'occuper le terrain par un hakem (fonctionnaire). Ce permis est souvent considéré comme un droit de propriété en lui-même par la population, alors que ce titre n'a aucune valeur définitive. Il est délivré contre le prix du terrain et les frais de bornage. À partir de ce moment, le bénéficiaire a deux ans pour construire (selon les règles d'urbanisme) avant de pouvoir réclamer le titre définitif de propriété. Ce circuit est complexe et très lent. Il y a eu de nombreuses dérives : occupation illégale, spéculation foncière, délivrance de titres par d'anciens hakem congédiés...\nCette réforme a suscité le phénomène des gazra en insinuant dans l'esprit de la population que l'occupation d'un terrain entraîne son appropriation légale ou au moins légitime.\nL'absence de plans cadastraux et d'archives dignes de ce nom est due au fait que la notion de propriété ne soit pas encore dans les mœurs, à cause de la tradition nomade.\nÀ partir de ce moment, l'informalisation du marché immobilier et foncier n'a pas connu de réelles limites et s'est poursuivie avec toutes les dérives d'urbanisme, les tensions et les spéculations qui s'ensuivent.\nMême lorsque l'état distribue quelques milliers de parcelles à des populations défavorisées, celle-ci, n'ayant pas les moyens de construire revendent ces parcelles à des gens plus aisés qui spéculent ensuite dessus, afin de se réinstaller plus loin pour éventuellement construire en plus dur. Cela engendre évidemment une spéculation foncière qui profite aux plus riches.\nTous les plans envisagés par les autorités pour Nouakchott depuis sa création ont été mis en échec par l'expansion rapide de la ville. Il suffit de citer une des tentatives pour améliorer l'accès au logement :\nLa SOCOGIM (société de Construction et de gestion Immobilière) a été créée en 74 pour favoriser l'accès au logement par la construction rapide de logements. En dix ans, 12 000 logements ont été construits, 16 000 parcelles accordées. Ce fut largement insuffisant face à l'afflux massif d'émigrés. C'est un des nombreux échecs de mise en place d'une réelle politique d'urbanisme.\n\nAprès avoir laissé faire ou mené pendant des années des politiques parfois contradictoires ou vouées à l'échec par manque de moyens, l'État se lance aujourd'hui dans un réengagement dans le domaine foncier et immobilier :\nPDU lancé avec l'aide de la Banque mondiale en 2000, 54 millions de dollars sur 10 ans pour Nouakchott. Le but est de densifier l'habitat plutôt que de continuer à étendre la ville, éviter son développement radial pour un développement plus concentrique, et éviter les sites impropres. Le PDU envisageait aussi un cadastrage général et précis mis à jour à l'aide de photos satellites. Ce programme ambitieux voulait éviter la distribution de parcelles supplémentaires dans le mesure du possible, or ce n'est pas ce qui semble se passer (exemple au nord : attribution de parcelles en zones inconstructibles en droit. Malgré l'accalmie dans l'afflux de nouveaux venus à accueillir, Nouakchott peut-elle arriver à rattraper son retard sur le plan de l'aménagement urbain tout en continuant d'intégrer les nouveaux migrants ?\nUn exemple de réussite :\nKébbé d'El Mina : opération de restructuration pour régulariser les habitations et viabiliser la zone.\nDéplacement des 2300 familles vivant sur les terrains destinés aux infrastructures (voirie et écoles), recasées dans le même quartier, sur une zone adjacente. Chaque famille a un terrain de 120 m2, propriété accordée au bout de trois ans si les familles restent sur les terrains sur cette période (finalité : enraciner les bénéficiaires dans le quartier). Depuis le lancement en 2003, presque toutes les familles ont construit en dur, l'objectif qui devait être atteint en trois ans l'a été à 90 % au bout de 10 mois. Système d'aide sous tutelle du commissariat aux droits de l'homme, avec ONG de microcrédit (unité de 10 familles, remboursement collectif).\nCette réussite a demandé la coopération de tous les acteurs capables de fournir un effort : État, ONG (cf. Le GRET), institution internationale, avec le soutien des habitants.\nPeut-être que la localisation de ce bidonville a pu aider pour parvenir à ce résultat.\nLa résorption de l'habitat spontané est un enjeu majeur pour Nouakchott, comme d'ailleurs pour les autres villes du monde arabe. Les autorités commencent à prendre conscience de la nécessité politique de ne pas abandonner ces populations (le danger islamiste provient souvent des bidonvilles comme au Maroc, ou des fiefs de l'opposition, comme c'est le cas en Mauritanie).\nMais la résorption de cet habitat précaire n'est pas non plus exempte de manipulation politique, de népotisme et même sous certains aspects cela entraîne la création de nouvelles notabilités.\n\nProblèmes principaux de la ville de Nouakchott\nNouakchott connaît de nombreux problèmes :\n\nune mauvaise urbanisation due aux deux noyaux qui se sont trop vite rejoints : difficulté de circulation, mauvais services, etc. ;\nune saturation de l'espace : les quartiers pauvres, Kebbé, se multiplient ;\nune pauvreté qui s'accroît ;\nle risque d'ensablement ;\nla menace liée à l'océan Atlantique : une partie de la ville est située en dessous du niveau de la mer ; les dunes, déjà fragiles, ont servi de supports à des constructions pauvres, ce qui a augmenté leur fragilité ;\nl'absence totale d'eau douce, qui doit être importée depuis le fleuve Sénégal distant de deux cent kilomètres. Le grand projet Aftout Sahli a apporté une solution définitive à ce problème, par une adduction d'eau qui relie Nouakchott au fleuve Sénégal et dont les travaux se sont achevés en 2011. Avant cette date, l'eau potable venait exclusivement du champ captant d'idini, à 60 km à l'Est de la ville.\nLa modification des courants côtiers marins due en grande partie à la construction du port, entraine une déstabilisation rapide du cordon dunaire côtier. Alors que paradoxalement s'intensifie l'urbanisation derrière ce cordon, dans une zone légèrement plus basse que le niveau de l'océan.\n\nRésorption des bidonvilles\nEn 2009, le gouvernement mauritanien a annoncé qu'il entamerait un processus de nettoyage du bidonville à la périphérie de Nouakchott, car 24 000 familles seraient finalement relogées dans des logements prévus dans la ville.\nLe processus devait commencer par le relogement de 9 000 familles de la périphérie dans une zone pauvre du quartier d'Arafat nommée \"Kosovo\" pour son taux de criminalité élevé et ses services médiocres.\nLe gouvernement prévoyait de commencer à déplacer les familles en juin 2009, malgré les inquiétudes des agences d'aide selon lesquelles les infrastructures nécessaires ne pouvaient pas être mises en place dans le quartier d'accueil.\nEn 2013, il a été signalé que \"les bidonvilles ont été remplacés par des logements sociaux pour les plus pauvres\n, la Banque mondiale signalant que le plan a rencontré un succès substantiel, entraînant l'accès à des services améliorés pour 181 035 personnes des bidonvilles.\n\nJumelage\nNotes et références\nBibliographie\n: document utilisé comme source pour la rédaction de cet article.\n\n(en) Anthony G.

      "content": "## Overview\nNouakchott is the capital of Mauritania and its largest city, with almost 1.2 million residents in 2019. The city is the hub of the Mauritanian economy and is home to a deepwater port and Nouakchott–Oumtounsy International Airport, one of the country's two international airports.\n\n## Understand\nNouakchott is built around a large tree-lined street, Avenue Gamal Abdel Nasser, which runs northeast through the city centre from the old airport. It divides the city into two, with the residential areas in the north and the medina quarter, along with the kebbe, a shanty town formed due to the displacement of people from other areas by the desert.\n\n## History\nNouakchott was a large, fortified fishing village (ksar) in pre-colonial times and under French rule. As Mauritania prepared for independence, it lacked a capital city and the area of present-day Nouakchott was chosen  to be a symbol of modernity and national unity. The village was selected for its central location and to avoid the sensitive issue of whether the capital was built in an area dominated by the Arab-descended Moors or Black Africans.\nConstruction began in 1958 to enlarge the village to house a population of 15,000. Nouakchott was planned with the expectation that commerce and other economic activities would not take place in the city. Nouakchott's central business district was planned with broad streets and a grid-like structure; the new Cinquième Quartier (Fifth District) was located close to this area and became the location of a large open-air market and residential area within a few years. By the 1970s, these new areas had grown so much that they replaced the old ksar in terms of importance, as they also hosted the governmental buildings and state enterprises.\n\n## Climate\nNouakchott has a hot desert climate with hot temperatures throughout the year, but cool winter night temperatures. While average high temperatures are relatively constant at around 33 °C (91 °F), average low temperatures can range from 25 °C (77 °F) during the summer months to 13 °C (55 °F) during the winter months. Minimum temperatures can be as low as 10 °C (50 °F) during winter nights in Nouakchott.  Nouakchott is affected by the dust-laden harmattan winds.\n\n## By plane\n18.31-15.9697221 Nouakchott–Oumtounsy International Airport (NKC  IATA). It is the base for Mauritania Airlines which flies from Bamako, Casablanca, Dakar, Abidjan and Nouadhibou.  The airline is not known for its punctuality. The airport also receives flights from Algiers on Air Algérie and from Paris on Air France. Other connections include Casablanca, Istanbul, Tunis and Gran Canaria.  The airport is 40 km north of Nouakchott.  Finding a taxi at the airport may be difficult especially late at night.  usually someone will help if you ask but the ride will not be cheap.  There is an ATM, but the chances of it working are low.  Carry enough cash in euros or U.S. dollars to get you into town which could be up to 50 in either currency.\n\n## By road\nTo/from Nouadhibou (470 km, ca. 6 hours): the most comfortable option, a Mercedes taking 4 passengers, costs from 4,000 UM. Sept-places are also available. It is also possible to arrange direct transport from Dakhla in Western Sahara. Ask in Hotel Sahara.\nTo/from Atar (440 km, ca. 6 hours): minibuses leave from Garage Atar along the N1 northeast of town, fare about 500 MRU to Atar.\nTo/from Rosso border with Senegal (200km, ca. 3 hours): Minibuses depart from garages near Carrefour Madrid, sept-places from the Garage Riyadh 7km further south. Fare is around 300 MRU per place.\n\n## Get around\nNormal fare in a shared taxi is 100 UM, but taxis around the city for non-set routes can cost up to 300 UM per person.\nYou can use the Mauritanian version of Uber called “ClassRide”, download the app available on Appstore and Play-store, or call the call centre 1122 to book a ride with comfortable vehicle, the fares starts at 1,000 UM (for less than 4 km), and then counts 200 UM for each km.\nThere are mainly shared taxis running in the city, but if you want to ride alone, you need to pay for all the seats (600 UM).\nFor an empty taxi between the fishing port and the city centre, be prepared to pay 1,500 UM, otherwise 100 UM per person should suffice if you find one with people in it.\nCity buses exist, but information about them does not. Only for the most adventurous travellers.\n\n## See\nAttractions in Nouakchott include the National Museum of Mauritania, the National Library and the National Archives.\n18.085556-15.9747221 National Museum of Mauritania.   (updated Feb 2023)\nHead to the bustling fishing wharf 'port de peche' for a firsthand look at Mauritania's artisanal fishing industry.  At evenings one can see teams of fishermen bring in the day's catch on brightly painted sea-canoes. The catch is sold on the spot and loaded onto donkey carts or ancient Renault 12s to be resold in town.\nThe Nouakchottois go to the beaches on weekend evenings (especially in the hot season). Swimming in the sea at Nouakchott can be dangerous due to the treacherous and strong current.\n\n## Do\n5 km west from central Nouakchott are beaches, the fishing wharf and a few seaside hotels.\nFranco-Mauritanian Cultural Center: movies, concerts, exhibits etc.\nStade Olympique: run laps at the stade Olympique, or watch a football match.\nFishing:  surf-casting is possible from the beaches near Nouakchott. Bring your own equipment. Some basic fishing supplies can be bought from Lebanese-owned shops in Nouakchott. Travel in groups only for security reasons.\n\n## Buy\nTraditional Mauritanian handicrafts are available in hotels, at the museum, and in shops catering to tourists at the top of Avenue Kennedy. Silver jewellery, such as bracelets and earrings, are popular souvenirs. Rugs made of camel wool can also be purchased. Items from Mauritania's fast-disappearing nomadic lifestyle, camel saddles and wooden chests, can be purchased.\nUnfortunately many items for sale in Nouakchott are of shoddy workmanship. Be prepared for some determined tracking down to find a quality piece. Dakar, Senegal is also a good place to purchase jewellery from Moorish silversmiths. There is a small collection of artisans selling quality good on Autoroute Rosso, away from the airport, but it is hard to find. Sometimes referred to as the Aritsian's Market or the Zoo. Most prices given to you can usually be haggled down to about a third of the given price, so don't be afraid to walk away at an initial offer.\nMarkets: the Marche Capitale and Marche Sixieme are the most interesting for purchasing local specialities and souvenirs. The Camel Market on the outskirts of the city on the road to Boutilimit makes an interesting visit.\nThe city also hosts the Nouakchott Silver Market. One beach is devoted to fishing boats where fish can be bought fresh. Nouakchott is a principal selling place of native Saharan meteorites.\n\n## Eat\nThere is a decent variety of restaurants in Nouakchott with plates from 1,000 to 3,500 UM. Most restaurants in the capital offer pretty much the same menu: pizzas, hamburgers, sandwiches and salads. Nicer places, such as Iman, will have steaks, brochettes, seafood and even curry.\nThere is a string of restaurants on the road from the Stade Olympique to the French Embassy such as Chez Lina on Ave du General de Gaulle (+222 45 24 06 84).\nNearby is Tafarit Sun House, +222 45 25 46 73, which,  depending on availability, has alcohol if you're a westerner.\nNear Marche Capitale, there is a street of sandwich shops that offer near-identical menus, the best of which is the Prince (which taxi drivers know by name).\nIf you wish to cook, there are many large markets, including Deja-Vu, next to Ta-ta on Du Gaulle, which specializes in American products.\n\n## Drink\nMauritania is a dry country, but alcohol can still be found if you know where to look. Many of the French- and Spanish-owned clubs and restaurants will have some whisky or beer available, depending on their supply, and cost from 2,000-3,000 UM a drink. If you're checking in the United States embassy, ask the Marines on duty (be subtle about it) if they're having a party. You'll have a great time in a safe place. Same can be said at just about every embassy, as the expat community is very close and will spend the weekends together.\nMonotel - Run by a Spanish father and son, this local gets busy at around two in the morning and regularly plays hosts to Senegalese DJs.

The first group of buses tends to depart every day at 07:00, but actually you have to wait till 08:00 and the second at 16:00 the bus ticket should cost no more than 400 UM except for Teissir voyage (500 UM) which is reputable among locals as the safest company and therefore requires reservation at least one day in prior.\nTerjit - there are buses from Nouakchott to Oujeft/Aoujeft that pass Terjit. Price is about 500 Ouguiya (2023). They leave quite far from the city centre on the road towards Akjoujt.
