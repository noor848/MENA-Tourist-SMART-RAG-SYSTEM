      "content": "## Overview\nTerjit (or Tergit) is a lush green oasis settlement in Saharan Mauritania. It is very peaceful.\n\n## Understand\nTerjit is 45 km (28 mi) south of Atar and popular with tourists in Mauritania. It nestles in a gorge on the western edge of the Adrar Plateau with the palm grove stretching a few hundred metres alongside a stream that emerges from a spring. Historically, it has been used for religious ceremonies, especially wedding ceremonies, as well as the coronation of a few African princes.\n\n## By bus\nThere are buses from Nouakchott or Akjoujt that go to Aoujeft/Oujeft and pass through Terjit; fare to/from Nouakchott is about 500 MRU. Bush taxis from Atar to Terjit are about 200 MRU per person. Alternatively, you can get a ride to the police checkpoint “Ras Darf” (junction along the N1 Atar-Nouakchott highway), and wait there until someone drives in the direction of Terjit/Aoujeft and gives you a lift.\n\n## By road\nTerjit is 11 km from National Highway 1. The distance to Atar is approximately 45 km.\n\n## See\nThe picture-perfect oasis and its location in the deep valley is the attraction. Entrance fees must be paid for the rear (eastern) part of the oasis (200 ouguiya, as of 2023); however, only once per visitor, even if they enter multiple times.\n\n## Do\nNothing. Relax. You're in a beautiful oasis in the middle of the desert.\nIn the palm grove of the oasis you can escape the heat of the desert and feel like you are in a paradise. There are picnic areas and a natural pool where you can swim (it is too small and shallow for swimming).\nSeveral hikes can be done around Terjit, provided you are armed against the sun, sure-footed and have a little experience with finding your way in the mountains and a sense of direction. Getting lost could be dangerous (don't wander off too far). There are two paths that run west from the southeast end of the oasis on the northeast and southwest escarpments, respectively. The northern path leads back from the plateau into the oasis at about the height of the Auberge \"Chez Jemal\". The southern path is a little further and leads to the road towards Aoujeft, on which you walk again for about a kilometer to the entrance to the oasis.\n\n## Buy\nThe shopping options are very limited. There are a few shops where water, biscuits and cans of sardines can be purchased. Sometimes the owner has to be called to open the store. Better bring a few more supplies with you.\nDates are harvested locally and can be purchased directly from the producer at reasonable prices.\n\n## Eat\nThe auberges also offer food for 200-500 ouguiyas (as of 2023).\n\n## Sleep\nThere are tents in the palm groves that you can pay to stay in.\nThere are several auberges where you can pitch your own tent or small cabins can be rented.\nAuberge des Caravanes: small huts with mosquito nets can be booked, good showers and toilets, 700 ouguiyas (as of 2023).\nChez Jemal: a tented camp with facilities available.\n\n## Stay safe\nProtect yourself against mosquito: they can carry malaria.\nGet sun protection.\nIt is easy to get lost walking in the desert or the mountains.\n\n## Go next\nAzougi\nChinguetti\nBack to Atar",
