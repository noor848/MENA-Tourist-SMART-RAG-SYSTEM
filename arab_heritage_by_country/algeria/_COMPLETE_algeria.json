          "content": "The Casbah of Algiers, commonly referred to as the Casbah (Arabic: القصبة, Al-qaṣabah, meaning \"citadel\"), corresponds to the old town or medina of Algiers, the capital of Algeria. It is a historic district that has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1992. Administratively, it is located within the municipality of Casbah, in the province of Algiers.\nLikely inhabited since the Neolithic period, as were various sites in the Algiers Sahel, the first mentions of the city date back to Antiquity, when it was initially a Phoenician port, later becoming Berber and eventually Roman. The current urban framework was designed in the 10th century by the Berbers under the Zirid dynasty, later enriched by contributions from other Berber dynasties that successively ruled the central Maghreb. The Casbah reached its peak during the period of the Regency of Algiers, serving as the seat of political power. Colonized by the French in 1830, it was gradually marginalized as power centers shifted to the new city. During the Algerian War, the Casbah played a crucial role, as a stronghold for FLN independence fighters. After Algeria gained independence in 1962, the Casbah did not reclaim its former central role and remained a marginalized city area.\nAn example of Islamic architecture and urban planning characteristic of Arab-Berber medinas, the Casbah is also a symbol of Algerian culture, a source of artistic inspiration, and home to an ancestral artisanal heritage. Local actors continue to fight to preserve and sustain its tangible and intangible heritage.\n\nEtymology\nMore generally, a kasbah is the walled citadel of many North African cities and towns. The name made its way into English from French in the late 19th century (the Oxford English Dictionary states 1895), and can be spelled \"kasbah\" or \"casbah\".\n\nGeography\nToponymy\nThe Casbah of Algiers takes its name from the citadel that overlooks it (designated in Arabic as القصبة, Al-Kasbah). Originally, the term \"Casbah\" referred to the highest point of the medina—the old city—of the Zirid era. Over time, it came to designate the entire medina, which was enclosed by the ramparts built during the Regency of Algiers in the 16th century.\n\nLocation and topography\nThe Casbah is located at the center of Algiers and forms its historic core. The city has historically occupied a strategic position, as its geographical location is central within Algeria and the Maghreb. Facing the Mediterranean Sea, it is built on terrain with a 118-meter elevation difference. At first glance, the Casbah appears as a cluster of houses built on a slope. The narrow and winding streets make it a car-free zone, where supply deliveries and waste collection are still traditionally done using donkeys. The district forms a triangular shape, with its base meeting the Bay of Algiers, giving it, when viewed from the sea, the appearance of a \"colossal pyramid\" or a \"triangular amphitheater\". The whiteness of its houses and their arrangement have inspired poetic descriptions from writers who liken Algiers to a \"sphinx\". The citadel, overlooking the medina, gives it the appearance of a \"well-guarded city\", earning it the Arabic nickname El Djazaïr El Mahroussa (\"Algiers the Protected\"). This reputation extended to Europe, where the memory of Charles V's failed invasion in 1541 persisted until the French landing in 1830.\nThe site's occupation dates back to the Punic era, with the earliest known trace dating from the late 6th century BCE. At that time, the Carthaginians sought to establish a network of trading posts along the southern Mediterranean coast to control commercial flows, including gold from sub-Saharan Africa, silver from Spain, and tin from the Cassiterides Islands. This system, known as \"Punic scales,\" provided sailors with sheltered stopovers where they could trade goods. The site of Algiers, then called Ikosim, featured small islands suitable for mooring and served as a relay between two Punic settlements, Bordj el Bahri (Rusguniae) and Tipaza, spaced 80 kilometers apart.\nThe location was protected by the Bab-el-Oued coastline on one side and by Agha Bay on the other, which was exposed to north and east winds and contained four small islands near the shore. On the coast, a 250-meter promontory provided refuge. The Bouzaréah massif supplied limestone for construction, while the surrounding area provided clay for bricks and access to fresh water. The city's port function was later confirmed by the Cordoban geographer Al-Bakri in the 11th century, who described Algiers as being protected by a harbor, islands, and a bay, making it a winter anchorage point. Throughout history, the site served not only as a refuge for commercial ships but also as a haven for pirates and corsairs.\n\nHinterland\nThe Bouzaréah massif, reaching an altitude of 400 meters, is part of the Algiers Sahel, which extends into the Mitidja plain and, further south, the Atlas Mountains, making Algiers an important outlet. This hinterland contributed to the city's wealth through agricultural production, including livestock farming and beekeeping. Since the Middle Ages, the city has been characterized by the presence of agricultural landowners, a strong commercial tradition, and its status as a major Mediterranean port, exporting various local products. This economic prosperity attracted numerous conquerors who successively ruled the Maghreb. Algiers is also located on the outskirts of Kabylia and, starting in the 16th century, became the primary destination for migrants from the region, surpassing Béjaïa, another major city in the central Maghreb. As a result, Algiers drew not only Kabylian agricultural products but also its labor force.\n\nHydrogeology\nWater for the old medina comes from the Algiers Sahel and the groundwater of Hamma, Hydra, and Ben Aknoun. It was originally transported through a network of aqueducts dating from the Regency of Algiers, which remains in place but has been replaced by a modern distribution system developed in the early 20th century.\nDuring the Regency of Algiers, the Casbah was supplied by four main aqueducts, some of which remained functional until the early 20th century. These aqueducts sourced water from nearby areas, including the Sahel, Telemly, Hamma, Hydra, and Bitraria. Groundwater was drawn using norias (water wheels) and collected in reservoirs to increase the aqueducts' flow. A system of filtering galleries also helped capture minor water veins. After passing through the aqueducts, the water was stored in reservoirs at the city's gates, from where it was distributed via pipelines to various fountains. The aqueducts were built between 1518 and 1620 and ran through the Fahs (the rural outskirts) to supply the medina. They did not rely solely on gravitational flow but employed the souterazi (siphon towers) technique. This method involved directing water through an elevated pillar, which, although it appeared to slow the flow, offered key advantages: releasing air pressure, balancing water levels across different channels, and ensuring relative control over the flow rate. This souterazi technique was also used in Constantinople and in some cities of Spain and the Maghreb.\nThe water sources originate from an area with limestone outcrops, gneiss, and granulite veins resting on a schist base. In addition to aqueducts and fountains, domestic wells—ranging from 50 to 70 meters deep and drilled into gneiss or schist layers—further contributed to the Casbah's water supply.\n\nHistory\nThe Casbah of Algiers is an ancient medina with millennia-old origins, taking into account the site's Punic and Roman past. It is considered a cultural asset of global importance due to its ancient heritage and the history it embodies.\n\nPrehistory\nThere are no traces of prehistoric settlement in the Casbah itself. However, given evidence of prehistoric habitation in the immediate surroundings (the Algiers Sahel), it is likely that such traces were simply obscured by the site's long-standing, dense, and continuous urbanization, and that it too was inhabited as early as the Neolithic period.\n\nThe Punic, Numidian and Roman Antiquity\nThe exact date of the Phoenician establishment of ancient Algiers (Ikosim) remains uncertain, but it likely occurred after the late 6th century BCE. It appears that two ports were founded in the Bay of Algiers: Rusguniae (Bordj El Bahri) in the east, which provided shelter from westerly winds, and Ikosim (Algiers) in the west, which protected from easterly winds. From this period, a Punic stele was discovered on Rue du Vieux Palais in Algiers, along with a stone sarcophagus found in 1868 in the Marengo Garden containing period jewelry, and numerous coins in the Marine district.\nThese 158 Punic lead and bronze coins, dating from the 2nd to 1st century BCE, bear the inscription \"IKOSIM,\" confirming the ancient name of Algiers, which had previously been assumed but unproven. According to Cantineau, the Punic etymology of Ikosim derives from two combined words: i, meaning \"island\", and kosim, meaning \"owl\" or alternatively \"thorn\". Thus, the ancient name of Algiers, Ikosim, translates to either \"Island of Owls\" or \"Island of Thorns.\" Victor Bérard, supported by Carcopino, preferred the translation \"Island of Seagulls.\" An ancient well was also discovered in the Marine district, containing pottery fragments from various periods. Other remains from antiquity indicate trade relations with the northern Mediterranean (Gaul, Spain, southern Italy) from the 3rd to 1st century BCE and, later, Roman presence until the 5th century CE.\nThe fall of Carthage in 146 BCE did not bring significant changes for Ikosim, which became part of the Numidian kingdom and later fell under the influence of the Mauri kingdom ruled by King Bocchus and his successors. Mauretania, which corresponds to this western part of North Africa, remained independent until 40 CE, when, after a period of rule by vassal kings such as Ptolemy of Mauretania, it came under the domination of the Roman Empire. The name Ikosim was Latinized into Icosium, and Roman settlers began arriving as early as the period of the vassal kings, even before the Roman conquest. As a result, the city saw the early establishment of Roman magistrates, as evidenced by an honorary Latin inscription dedicated to King Ptolemy, discovered on Hadj Omar Street in the Casbah. Another inscription referring to Ptolemy is found on a slab within the minaret of the Great Mosque.\nBy 40 CE, the Mauritanian kingdom was reduced to a Roman province under Emperor Caligula. Icosium was administered by a procurator-governor based in Caesarea (modern-day Cherchell). Emperor Vespasian later granted Icosium Latin rights, elevating it to the status of a Roman city, though with fewer privileges than full Roman colonies.\nThe city's ancient walls likely defined an area similar to that occupied during the Ottoman Regency of Algiers, though habitation was concentrated near the coast, with steeper slopes probably used as gardens. Above the densely populated lower city, the higher ground likely housed residential districts, all surrounded by rural villas. Various Roman-era remains discovered around the Casbah site indicate the layout of an ancient road leading toward the Belouizdad district.\nThe ancient necropolises, located outside the city in accordance with Roman customs, provide an even more refined indication of the perimeter of the city of Icosium. The discovered tombs indicate that burials were located to the north and northwest of the city, a historical constant observed during the Berber and Turkish periods, and continuing to this day with the Saint-Eugène cemetery. This cemetery is notable for being two kilometers away from the Casbah, whereas cemeteries were traditionally placed directly beneath city walls.\nIt is difficult to trace the axes of the ancient city due to numerous alterations in the urban fabric. However, the lower Casbah was partially replaced by a modern colonial-era city that follows the layouts and axes already established in antiquity.\nLittle is known about the city's economic life, which was likely centered around its port.\nReligious life was initially dedicated to the Roman pantheon. At an undetermined date, the city became Christian, with several Donatist and Catholic bishops. Remains from this period were discovered during excavations in the 2000s, linked to the construction of the Algiers metro and the redevelopment of Place des Martyrs. Among the findings was a Roman basilica adorned with mosaics, whose central space spanned nearly 10 meters, likely dating back to the 3rd or 4th century, as well as a Byzantine-era necropolis.\nThere is little information about the following centuries, except for the sacking of the city by Firmus in 371 or 372. The ancient history of Icosium then fades into that of the province of Mauretania and later the Byzantine domination, until the founding of the present-day medina—El Djazaïr Beni Mezghana—by Bologhin Ibn Ziri in 960, marking a new chapter in the city's history.\n\nThe Zirid period and Central Maghreb under Berber dynasties\nThe Casbah corresponds to the old city of Algiers, the medina, built by Bologhin Ibn Ziri in 960 on the ruins of the ancient Roman city of Icosium, in the territory of the Berber tribe of the Beni Mezghenna. This 10th-century foundation appears confirmed by the fact that no authors from the Arab conquest period mention it, and it is only in the 10th century that Eastern writers begin to reference it. The name given by Bologhin Ibn Ziri is believed to be a reference to the islands that once faced Algiers' port and were later attached to its current jetty. In Arabic, Al-Djaza’ir (الجزائر) means \"The Islets.\" Other hypotheses, notably by the Andalusian scholar Al-Bakri, suggest that the correct name is the one preserved in the city's oral tradition—Dzeyer—which would be a tribute to Ziri, the city's founder. To this day, Algiers' inhabitants refer to themselves as Dziri.\nIbn Hawkal, a Baghdad-based merchant, described the city in the 10th century:\n\nThe city of Algiers is built on a gulf and surrounded by a wall. It contains many bazaars and a few sources of fresh water near the sea, from which the inhabitants draw their drinking water. In the city's outskirts, there are vast fields and mountains inhabited by several Berber tribes. The inhabitants' main wealth consists of herds of cattle and sheep grazing in the mountains. Algiers produces so much honey that it becomes an export commodity, and the quantities of butter, figs, and other goods are so great that they are exported to Kairouan and beyond.\nFrom the 10th to the 16th century, according to Louis Leschi, Algiers was a Berber city surrounded by Berber tribes who practiced cereal farming in the Mitidja or livestock herding in the Atlas, generating significant revenue through trade. Around 985, Al-Muqaddasi visited the city and echoed Ibn Hawkal's observations. Al-Bakri later highlighted Algiers' rich ancient heritage, noting the presence of a dār al-mal‛ab (theater or amphitheater), mosaics, and church ruins. He also mentioned many souks (leswak) and a large mosque (masgid al-ǧāmi). He described the port as well-sheltered and frequented by sailors from Ifriqiya, Spain, and \"other countries\".\nAlgiers fell under Almoravid control in 1082 when their ruler, Yusuf Ibn Tashfin, built the Great Mosque of Algiers (Jamaa el Kebir). In 1151, Abd al-Mumin, a Zenata Berber from Nedroma, took Algiers from the Almoravids and became the Almohad caliph, ruling over the entire Maghreb and Andalusia.\nIn the 14th century, the Arab tribe of the Tha'alaba established a local stronghold around the city, forming a local magistrate dynasty known as a \"bourgeois senate\". Al-Djazaïr survived by remaining a vassal state to the Zianids of Tlemcen, who built the minaret of the Great Mosque, the Hafsids of Tunis, and the Marinids of Fez, who constructed the Bou Inania madrasa.\nHowever, Algiers' growing piracy activity led Ferdinand of Aragon, following the Reconquista, to seize and fortify the islet in front of the city (the Peñón) to neutralize it. Seeking to free the city from Spanish control, Salim at-Toumi, Algiers' leader, called upon Aruj Barbarossa. This marked the beginning of the Regency of Algiers, during which the city became the capital of the Central Maghreb.\n\nThe regency of Algiers\nThe Barbarossa brothers permanently expelled the Spanish from the Peñón islet in 1529. Aruj Barbarossa then decided to establish a real port by connecting the islet to the mainland, creating Algiers' jetty and admiralty, as well as a harbor for ships. These developments allowed the city to become the primary base for corsairs in the western Mediterranean. Algiers became the capital of its regency, and the term Al Jazâ'ir was used in international documents to refer to both the city and the territory it controlled. Charles V launched the Algiers expedition in 1541, but it failed. In response, the city's defenses were reinforced, especially along the coast. Algiers was enclosed by a fortified wall with gates such as Bab Azoun, Bab El Oued, Bab J'did, and Bab Dzira, and was protected by a series of forts built between the 16th and 17th centuries: Lefanar, Goumen, Ras el Moul, Setti Taklit, Zoubia, Moulay Hasan (renamed Fort l’Empereur after the French occupation), Qama’at El Foul, and Mers Debban. Later, the Bordj J'did (1774), as well as the Lebhar and Ma-Bin forts in the early 19th century, were constructed.\nThe fortress overlooking the city was built between 1516 (started by Aruj Barbarossa) and 1592 (completed under Kheder Pasha). However, the Regency's rulers initially governed from the Djenina Palace, known locally as dar soltan el kedim, which was demolished during the colonial period. It only became the ruler's residence in 1817 under Ali-Khodja, the second-to-last dey of Algiers. Seeking to escape the tyranny of the militia, he abandoned the centrally located Djenina Palace and transferred the public treasury to the Casbah, where he barricaded himself with a personal guard of 2,000 Kabyles.\nApart from agricultural and manufactured products, the city derives its income from the corso: the \"Barbary piracy.\" Slavery is also practiced, mainly for domestic work, and there is a significant presence of European captives. These captives, whose living conditions are relatively mild when ransom is possible, endure a much harsher existence when they are employed in the galleys. The government, or beylik, collects a portion of the revenues from maritime raids in the Mediterranean. These revenues help finance the militia and fund public works (such as the sewage system and aqueducts). The corsairs, called reïs, and the notable figures of the beylik build luxurious residences in the lower part of the city, while Arab families primarily settle in the upper part. The golden age of piracy in the 17th century leads to a series of European expeditions, in the form of bombardments of the city. It also faces earthquakes (1716 and 1755) and plague epidemics (1740, 1752, 1787, and 1817). These factors, combined with economic decline and political instability, cause the city's population to shrink. From over 100,000 inhabitants in the 17th century, the population drops to around 30,000 by 1830.\n\nOn April 30, 1827, the Casbah witnesses the famous \"fan incident,\" which serves as a pretext for the French conquest of Algiers on July 5, 1830, during the reign of Charles X. Its last occupant is Dey Hussein. Count and Marshal de Bourmont resides there in July 1830 after the city's capture.\n\nFrench colonial period\nThe French army enters Algiers on July 5, 1830. French presence drastically changes the city's appearance and its medina. The French transform the city by demolishing a large part of the lower Casbah and building what is now \"Place des Martyrs.\" Originally extending to the sea, the Casbah is pushed into the background by the new waterfront with its arcaded architecture. Colonization also introduces new roads that surround and penetrate the Casbah. Architecturally, the French introduce the Haussmannian style and demolish the old city's walls.\nThe period of demolitions lasts until 1860 when Napoleon III halts the policy and sides with the mufti of the Great Mosque of Algiers, preventing further mosques from being converted into churches, as had happened with the Ketchaoua Mosque and the Ali Bitchin Mosque.\nLater in the colonial period, a neo-Moorish architectural movement emerges, with its most famous landmarks being the Thaâlibiyya Medersa in 1904 and the Algiers Grand Post Office in 1913. The \"Arab city\" is traditionally centered around its mosque and souk, but colonization introduces a new spatial organization. Algiers becomes a city where the old and new, the sacred and the secular, coexist, reshaping spaces of social interaction.\n\nWith the construction of new European neighborhoods, the Casbah—once the entirety of Algiers in 1830—begins to be perceived as a marginal, residual, and unstable urban area, as economic and political centrality shifts to these new districts. However, it retains social spaces such as mosques, Moorish cafés, plazas (rahba), and hammams. This pattern persists even after independence, and the Casbah never regains its former significance.\n\nThe Algerian war\nThe nationalist movement, which develops in the early 20th century, intensifies in the 1950s, leading to the Algerian War. The Casbah becomes a stronghold of nationalists.\nIn 1956, newly elected by the \"Soummam Congress,\" the members of the CCE (Coordinating and Executive Committee)—Abane Ramdane, Larbi Ben M'hidi, Krim Belkacem, Saad Dahlab, and Benyoucef Benkhedda—decide to establish themselves in the Casbah. They believe it offers greater control over FLN militants, better communication links, and, most importantly, complete clandestinity. With its hideouts, numerous couriers lost among the masses, and various forms of protection, the capital is seen as an ideal base for urban guerrilla warfare, which they consider as crucial as fighting in the mountains.\nThe Casbah is the key battleground of the \"Battle of Algiers\" in 1957. This battle pits Yacef Saadi, head of the Autonomous Zone of Algiers (ZAA) and the independence fighters, against General Massu's 10th Parachute Division. On the ground, the \"battle\" is won by the French army, which dismantles the FLN networks and the political-administrative organization of the Autonomous Zone of Algiers, using methods later systematized: intelligence gathering by any means, including torture, and from June 1957 onwards, converting and manipulating captured fighters. The streets leading from the Casbah to the European quarters are sealed off with barbed wire and monitored by police and Zouaves.\nCaptain Léger's infiltration of Yacef Saadi's courier network allows for Saadi's capture on September 23, 1957, at 3 Rue Caton in the Casbah. In October, the FLN enforcer Ali la Pointe, cornered with his comrades Hassiba Ben Bouali, Hamid Bouhmidi, and Petit Omar at 5 Rue des Abderrames, is killed when French paratroopers of the 1st REP detonate their hideout, causing a massive explosion that also kills seventeen civilians, including four young girls aged four and five.\nThe Casbah also plays a role in the December 1960 demonstrations, where Algerians march into European neighborhoods, and later in the popular uprisings during Algeria's independence.\n\nPost-independence\nAfter Algeria's independence, the Casbah experiences an exodus, with native families—the beldiya—moving to more spacious European-style apartments in Bab el Oued or El Biar. The Casbah becomes a site of speculation and transience, where properties are rented and sublet. The original inhabitants are gradually replaced by rural migrants.\nRestoration plans follow one another without success due to a lack of political will. The Casbah quickly becomes an overcrowded, deteriorating area that never regains its central role in Algiers. However, it remains a powerful symbol of resistance against injustice and a site of collective memory for the Algerian people. UNESCO designates the Casbah as a World Heritage Site in 1992 and continues to contribute to its preservation. Local associations and residents also engage in restoration efforts and social initiatives. The citadel overlooking the site is currently undergoing advanced restoration.\n\nNotable Figures\nDjamila Bent Mohamed, an Algerian painter, was born there.\nMohamed Tadjadit, an Algerian poet, grew up there.\n\nSocio-Urban Structure\nThe urban layout of the Casbah of Algiers is characteristic of Maghrebian Arab-Berber medinas. The later Ottoman influence is mainly seen in military architecture, particularly in the citadel overlooking the city. Originally, the term \"Casbah\" referred solely to this citadel before it was extended to encompass the entire medina, defined by the fortifications built during the Regency of Algiers in the 16th century. The Casbah of Algiers presents a complex and mysterious urban fabric, particularly intriguing to Orientalist painters. The city's natural topography explains its winding streets, true labyrinths characteristic of the old city, as it occupies a hilly site facing the sea. According to architect Ravéreau, \"the site creates the city\", while Le Corbusier observes that houses and terraces are oriented toward the sea, a source of both fortune and misfortune (shipwrecks, missing sailors). The old city is fundamentally oriented towards the Mediterranean and turns its back on the hinterland. It is severed from direct sea access during colonization due to the construction of coastal boulevards. The very narrow alleys sometimes lead to dead ends or vaulted passageways known as sabat. Donkeys are among the few animals capable of navigating the entire Casbah, and since the era of the Regency of Algiers, they have been used for garbage collection. Alongside the dense network of traditional alleyways, colonial-era roads like \"Rue d'Isly\" and \"Rue de la Lyre\" penetrate the Casbah.\nThe Casbah has an urban space organization that aligns with the site and its terrain. To this day, it remains oriented toward the \"Amirauté,\" its historic port. Le Corbusier deemed its urban planning perfect, noting the tiered arrangement of houses, which ensures that each terrace has a view of the sea. The spatial organization reflects social life. Certain spaces are considered intimate, such as house terraces, which are primarily reserved for women. The hawma, referring to the neighborhood, is seen as a semi-private space, while commercial centers (souks), fountains, and places of power are regarded as fully public. The Casbah also has, in each district, mosques and kouba (shrines) of local saints, such as those of Sidi Abderrahmane and Sidi Brahim, whose tomb is located in the Amirauté of Algiers.\n\nThe Casbah of Algiers is traditionally divided into a \"lower Casbah,\" a large part of which was demolished to make way for colonial-style buildings and the present-day Place des Martyrs, and an \"upper Casbah,\" which is better preserved and includes the citadel and Dar Soltan, the last palace of the Dey. The lower Casbah has traditionally been the hub of trade and power in the old city. It is where the traditional decision-making centers were concentrated, such as the former palace of the Dey, the Djenina—demolished during colonization—Dar Hassan Pacha, which became the winter palace of the governor of Algeria during the colonial period, as well as the Palais des Raïs, which housed the corsairs of the Regency of Algiers. This district was also the focus of modifications by the colonial administration, keen to establish itself in the heart of Algiers and leave its mark on the city. The walls and gates were partially demolished by the French military during the city's redevelopment. However, they remain in popular memory through toponymy. Thus, it is common to navigate Algiers using the names of the city's former gates, such as Bab El Oued (which gives its name to the adjacent neighborhood), Bab Jdid, Bab el Bhar, and Bab Azzoun. Within the Casbah, there are souks, such as those in the Ketchaoua Mosque district and Jamaa el Houd (the former synagogue of Algiers). Some souks have retained their specialties, such as the one on Rue Bab Azzoun, dedicated to traditional clothing (burnous, karakou, etc.), or the one on Rue des Dinandiers. The Algerian souk, which was banned at the beginning of the colonial period, remains the most common means of trade for the population, particularly through the practice of trabendo (informal trade). The streets around the Ketchaoua Mosque are often filled with merchandise, recreating an atmosphere reminiscent of the old city's social and economic interactions. The Casbah also preserves functional hammams, such as \"Hammam Bouchlaghem,\" which dates back to the Ottoman era and is frequented by both the Jewish and Muslim communities of the city. The city's former commercial vocation is reflected in its foundouks, such as the one near Jamaa el Kebir, which still has a courtyard surrounded by stacked arcades, or the one located within the citadel.\nSince the time of the Regency of Algiers, the Casbah has always played a leading role in Algeria, offering opportunities to both poor inhabitants and merchants from the countryside. It has attracted many Kabyles, given their region's proximity, as well as, to a lesser extent, peasants from all over Algeria after the country's independence. This rural exodus has led to a relative overpopulation of the Casbah. It remains a gateway to the city of Algiers, serving as a transit point and a refuge for the most destitute. The departure of original families to other neighborhoods, such as Bab El Oued, in search of European-style apartments has led to ongoing social transformations within the Casbah, with a constant renewal of part of its population since independence.\nThe Casbah is also socially defined by its traditional craftsmanship, which provides a livelihood for many families. Craftsmen used to organize themselves into zenkat (commercial streets), such as the zenkat n'hass (Copper Alley) for coppersmiths. However, due to social changes during colonization and after independence, traditional crafts have significantly declined. Artisans no longer group themselves into guilds or zenkat, and many prefer to abandon their trades, which no longer guarantee sufficient income in a modern society. Nonetheless, local associations, residents, and, to a lesser extent, authorities, are working to preserve these trades and uphold their social role through apprenticeship schools, where young people are trained in artisanal crafts.\n\nThe Casbah is a meeting place for two forms of socialization. The first is that of the beldiya (native city dwellers), who can be considered part of a \"mythical\" socialization process, as they symbolize the city and justify certain social practices through a shared identity. The second form of socialization is that of migrants, who have developed their own cultural expressions. Their contributions to popular culture—through music, cafés, and the concept of bandits d'honneur (honorable outlaws)—reflect their deep-rooted presence in the city. In practice, symbols of this popular culture, often carried by people of rural origin, are frequently used in nostalgic narratives about the Casbah. Hadj El Anka, the famous chaâbi singer born in Bab Jdid (upper Casbah), is often cited as one of the key figures of Casbadji life. The image of a warm, close-knit, and tolerant popular culture continues to shape descriptions of daily life in the Casbah.\n\nPopulation and demographics\nIn antiquity, the population of Algiers was relatively small, consisting mainly of Romanized Berbers. During the Zirid period in the 10th century, the city became a small but prosperous settlement, though its population remained limited—small enough to seek refuge on nearby islets in case of attack. The exclusively Berber character of Algiers' population was later modified with the arrival of the Tha‛alaba, a small Arab tribe expelled from Titteri in the 13th century. This led to a gradual process of Arabization, particularly in the religious sphere.\nThe city's growth in the 16th and 17th centuries was accompanied by demographic expansion. Algiers had about 60,000 inhabitants by the late 14th century and over 150,000 by the 17th century. This demographic shift transformed the city into a melting pot of Mediterranean populations at the expense of its Berber heritage. By this time, Kabyles made up only a tenth of the population, largely due to the Ottoman rulers' distrust of these groups, whose region remained politically independent, structured around the dissident Kingdom of Koukou and the Kingdom of the Beni Abbès.\nThe rest of the population included Arab families from Algiers, some descended from the Tha‛alaba, as well as Andalusians and Tagarins who arrived from the 14th century onward. In the early 17th century, Algiers welcomed 25,000 Moriscos, who contributed to the city's urban expansion. Other residents came from cities within the Regency, such as Annaba, Constantine, and Tlemcen. These urban dwellers distinguished themselves from the Arabs of the interior, particularly through their dialect, which was difficult for southern nomads and Berbers to understand. Many worked in administration, commerce, or religious affairs. The Turks controlled key positions in the government, military, and navy, while the city also attracted many Christian renegades, who were often recruited as corsairs. Another significant group was the berrani (\"outsiders\"), rural communities mainly from Saharan cities and oases such as Biskra, Laghouat, and the M'zab region. A Jewish community also lived in Algiers, composed of rural migrants from within Algeria, as well as Jews of Spanish origin who arrived from the 14th century and later from Livorno in the 17th century. Additionally, the city was home to Kouloughlis (offspring of Turkish fathers and local mothers) and freed Black slaves.\nWith the decline of Barbary piracy in the late 17th century, Algiers' population began to shrink. From 150,000 inhabitants in the 17th century, it fell to 50,000 by the late 18th century and just 25,000 on the eve of the French conquest. After the city was taken by the French in 1830, nearly half of the population emigrated, refusing to live under Christian rule. By 1831, a census recorded only 12,000 residents, a decline explained by the flight of 6,000 Turks and the departure of urban populations to the interior regions of the country.\nAlgiers' Muslim population did not return to its previous levels until 1901, thanks to a massive influx of Kabyle migrants, leading to a process of \"re-Berberization\" of the city. By the 20th century, the Casbah had become home to a significant number of families from the Djurdjura region.\nAfter independence, the Casbah underwent another wave of migration. Many urban families moved to former European neighborhoods, while rural migrants replaced them. The Casbah remains one of the most densely populated areas in the world, though its population density has declined since the 1980s as residents move to less crowded districts in Algiers. This residential de-densification has helped ease overcrowding in working-class neighborhoods. However, the collapse of aging buildings has also contributed to population decline. In 2004, the administrative district of the Casbah (which extends slightly beyond the historical site) had 45,076 residents, down from 70,000 in 1998. The historic site itself housed 50,000 inhabitants in 1998, with a density of 1,600 people per hectare, despite its capacity being estimated at only 900 per hectare.\n\nArchitecture\nThe Casbah of Algiers is a quintessential example of traditional Maghrebi cities, found in the western Mediterranean and sub-Saharan Africa. Despite various changes over time, the urban ensemble has largely preserved its integrity. The aesthetic characteristics of Islamic art and the original construction materials remain intact.\nThe Casbah still retains its citadel, palaces, mosques, wast al-dar (houses with central patios), mausoleums, and hammams, all of which contribute to its unique identity. Its military architecture bears Ottoman influences from the Regency period, while its civil architecture maintains the authenticity of Maghrebi medinas. However, the Casbah is also an evolving space. During the colonial era, some buildings were demolished to make way for European-style residences, particularly along the waterfront and at the city's European periphery. As a result, Haussmann-style buildings from the colonial period now stand at the edges of the Casbah and are considered part of its classified heritage. In addition, modifications to housing structures have introduced non-traditional materials, and traditional building supplies—such as thuya wood—are becoming scarce. The Casbah's social marginalization and the inefficiency of conservation plans have made it a threatened site, despite its UNESCO classification.\n\nConstruction techniques\nWalls and arches\nThe walls of the Casbah are built using the commande technique, meaning they are composed of tightly fitted bricks. Some walls feature a mixed structure, using a variety of materials such as rubble and wood. One commonly used method is the construction of double-layered walls, with a rigid brick outer layer and a flexible wooden framework. This design provides earthquake resistance. The vertical structures include brick arcades and columns, with two main types of arches: outrepassé brisé (broken horseshoe arches) and pointed arches. Cedarwood beams are often placed at the base of arch capitals or at the intersection of two arches.\n\nRoofs and floors\nThe roofing can be masonry or wood-structured. Masonry roofs are often cross-vaulted and can be used for domestic spaces such as entrances, stair landings, or large spaces in major buildings (palaces, mosques...). Wooden structures are often used for floors or terrace roofs; they are composed of logs, over which branches or wooden planks are placed to support a mortar made of earth and lime. This mortar itself serves as a base for ceramic tiles or a lime waterproofing layer for terraces. Metal structures, used as floor supports, are more recent as they date back to the colonial period (19th century). This non-traditional material has aged poorly, and many structural issues are due to its use.\n\nOpenings and staircases\nCrossings in masonry structures can be made using arcades, which are themselves masonry, or flat bands of wood or marble. In patios, the arches are most often horseshoe arches forming a slight ogive. The staircases in the Casbah are masonry structures with a wooden framework. A sloped platform is poured over wooden logs, on top of which bricks form the steps. Decoration varies, with marble adorning grand residences, while slate is used in modest homes.\n\nOrnaments\nVarious elements are used to decorate the houses of the Casbah: wooden balustrades, door openings, capitals, and ceramic tiles for floors and walls. The porticos and galleries give the Casbah its distinctive architectural identity. The arrangement of ogival arches is characteristic of its spatial composition. The patio is an example of this arrangement, where the harmony of the arch sequence can mask geometric variations, provided they maintain a consistent height (from the springing of the arch to its keystone). Variations in the width of the arches do not disrupt the overall visual harmony. The Casbah's arches are often of the horseshoe type; their shapes, either pointed or broken, constitute an Algerian architectural specificity.\nThe characteristic ornamentation includes horizontal friezes and vertical appliqués. These arch ornaments are made of ceramics, and the size of the rings is in harmony with the overall architectural design. Given the considerable demand for tiles, some are imported from Italy, France, and the Netherlands. Finally, capitals, some of which are recovered from the Roman ruins of Icosium, are used to decorate the upper parts of columns. Capitals and abaci reinforce the uniqueness of the Casbah's architecture.\n\nDomestic architecture\nThe domestic architecture of the Casbah represents a traditional human habitat rooted in Muslim culture and deeply Mediterranean in character. The typology remains relatively stable between palaces and the modest artisan's home. The typical Casbah house is clustered, attached, and presents only one façade. It is believed that this method of grouping dwellings dates back to the Zirid era. The footprint of a house generally ranges between 30 m2 and 60 m2.\nIt always has a view of the sea thanks to its terrace, and light is generally provided by the patio or, less frequently, by a window facing the street. The entrance door always includes a grille to allow ventilation of the lower floors with cool air from the alleyways. The Algerian house is oriented inward, particularly toward its patio (wast al-dar), which is the heart of the home and contains a well (bir). It serves as a convivial space for families, with up to four sharing a house, and is also the traditional area for receiving visitors. The walls are masonry constructions made of lightly fired earth bricks and a mortar consisting of lime and thick earth. The floors are built with wooden logs, while the foundations use a barrel vault technique. The roof is flat, with a thick layer of earth—up to 70 cm on terraces—and the surface is coated with a mortar made of earth and natural additives, all covered with lime. The wastewater drainage system consists of a genuine network of brick sewers beneath the streets, following the slope of the site, dating back to the Regency of Algiers. The connections are made with interlocking pottery elements. Since colonization, the network has been modernized.\n\nThe domestic typology of the Casbah is divided into several subcategories: the alaoui house, the chebk house, the portico house, and the palaces. The alaoui house is the only one without a patio, with air and light coming through windows. Built on a small plot, its ground floor—smaller than the total footprint due to the sloping terrain—may be used for commerce or storage. The upper floor—sometimes two floors—contains a single large room. To maximize space, this type of house incorporates overhangs.\nThe chebk house is often an annex (douera) of a larger house and is designed to fit minimal space constraints. Its very narrow patio is located upstairs and is paved with marble, while the rooms have terracotta tile flooring. The walls also feature ceramic tiles and lime. The portico house is the quintessential patio house, oriented inward. In the upper floors, it may cede space to neighboring houses and often features a beautiful second-floor room with a kbou (a cantilevered projection over the street aligned with the room). The patio and windows are adorned with ceramic tiles in geometric or floral motifs.\n\nTypology of the medina\nAlgerian medinas reflect an evolution in urban typology over time. It is established that cities and urban spaces develop from villages into proto-urban and then fully urban typologies throughout history. The transition from a proto-urban nucleus to an urban one is marked morphologically by horizontal and then vertical densification, a classic pattern in the evolution of dwellings over the centuries.\nDensification, for a given plot, consists of occupying all available space; then, additional construction modules are stacked to create upper floors. Algiers is a city with variable development, exhibiting the successive stages of this evolution. It reached a significant level of urbanization as early as the medieval period, featuring an advanced typology of buildings reaching up to four stories above the ground floor, with an average of two stories in the Casbah. In contrast, the Casbah of Dellys, as old as that of Algiers, represents a proto-urban typology, where courtyard staircases are not integrated into the layout to form a patio but remain an occasional architectural means of access to upper rooms.\nThe typology of the medina is dense in a horizontal sense and introverted; the patio houses occupying a central plot can even be adjoining on all four sides (this typology can be found in Algiers, Blida, Miliana, and Dellys). Houses share one, two, or three party walls. The limited space within the housing block, where similar and neighboring houses proliferate, influences the individual typology of each house. The whole forms a continuous built environment characteristic of the Casbah, of the \"load-bearing\" type.\n\nPalaces and residences\nThe main current palaces and residences of the Casbah include Dar Aziza, Dar Hassan Pacha, Palais Mustapha Pacha, Palais Ahmed Bey, Palais El Hamra, Dar Khedaoudj el Amia, Dar El Kadi, Dar Soltan, the Maison du Millénaire, the Palais des Raïs, Dar Essadaka, and Dar Es Souf. Additionally, the extra-muros palaces of the Fahs of Algiers and residences incorporated as dependencies of public institutions (hospitals, a high school) are part of this heritage.\n\nThe oldest of these palaces is the Jenina, which was ravaged by a fire in 1844. This palace, originally a Berber fort, served as the residence of the local sovereigns of Algiers during the Middle Ages, notably the last one, Salim at-Toumi. It predates the Regency of Algiers, during which it was the seat of power. The people of Algiers called it Dar Soltan el Qedim, and it remained the center of power until 1817. Only part of this complex remains, including Dar Aziza, located on Place des Martyrs, facing the Ketchaoua Mosque. The palace of Dar Aziza is typical of 16th-century Algerian residences. Originally three stories high, it lost its top floor during the 1716 earthquake. It was used as a storage facility in 1830, and in 1832, the staircase leading to the terrace was removed. After some modifications, it became the residence of the archbishop during French colonization. Dar Aziza is rich in wall decorations made of sculpted marble and features a magnificent patio adorned with fountains, woodwork, ceramics, and colored glass screens.\nThe Palais Mustapha Pacha was built in 1798. One of its unique features is that it contains half a million antique tiles from Algeria, Tunisia, as well as Spain and Italy. The marble of its fountain comes from Italy, and its doors are made of cedar. Today, it houses the Calligraphy Museum of Algiers.\nThe Palais Hassan Pacha is a Maghrebi-style palace built in 1791. It was modified during the colonial period with neo-Gothic and Orientalist architectural elements.\nThe Palais Ahmed Bey is located in the Lower Casbah, in the Souk-el-Djemâa district, bordering Hadj Omar Street. It is part of the Jenina palace complex. Built in the 16th century as the dey's residence, it follows the typical architectural style of the period. It now houses the administration of the National Theatre of Algeria.\n\nThe Palais des Raïs is one of the last surviving remnants of the medina located by the sea, and it has undergone recent restoration. This palace, once belonging to corsairs, alternates between public and private spaces. It comprises three palatial buildings and six modest dwellings (douerates) decorated with refined elements such as ceramic tiles, wooden balustrades, marble columns, and intricately adorned ceilings. It also includes an old hammam and a menzah (a terrace overlooking the site with a view of the sea). Today, this palace functions as a cultural center.During the Regency of Algiers, many summer palaces were located outside the city walls in the Fahs of Algiers. The Fahs refers to the outskirts and suburbs of the medina and is a distinct space from the main city. It was the site of various summer palaces and residences with gardens. One of the most famous among them is the Bardo Palace, which now houses the Bardo National Museum.\n\nMosques\nAmong the principal mosques of the Casbah of Algiers are Jamaa Ketchaoua, Jamaa el Kebir, Jamaa el Jdid, Jamaa Ali Bitchin, Jamaa Sidi Ramdane, Jamaa Sidi M’hamed Cherif, Jamaa el Berrani, Jamaa el Safir, and Jamaa li Houd.\nThe oldest mosque in the Casbah of Algiers is Jamaa El Kebir, the Great Mosque, built in 1097 by Yusuf Ibn Tashfin in the Almoravid style. It was constructed at a time when Andalusian artistic influence was strong in the Maghreb. The defining features of this mosque are its prayer hall and minaret. The hypostyle prayer hall is centrally arranged, with powerful pillars connected by large, festooned arches—lobed for the nave and simple, polished for the aisles. The mihrab is decorated with columns and ceramics. The minaret, rebuilt by a Zayyanid sultan of Tlemcen in 1324, is quadrangular, topped with a small lantern, and adorned with ceramics and fine carvings. The external gallery is not original; it was built using marble columns from the demolished Es-Sayida Mosque, which was once located on Place des Martyrs and was destroyed during colonization.\nJamaa Sidi Ramdane is one of the medieval mosques of the medina, dating back to the 11th century.\nJamaa Ketchaoua is a unique structure that stands as a testament to the history of the Casbah. Founded in 1436, before the Regency of Algiers, it was built when Berber dynasties ruled the city. Its architecture blends Moorish, Turkish, and Byzantine styles. The mosque was modified during the Regency and especially during French colonization, when it was converted into a cathedral before being returned to Islamic worship upon Algeria's independence. A larger building was constructed around 1613 under the Regency's rule, and it was further renovated in 1794 under Hassan Pacha's administration. Its architecture was inspired by Turkish mosques built in the Byzantine style. From 1844 onward, under French colonization, modifications were made to adapt it for Catholic use, resulting in the removal of its original Maghrebi-style square minaret and the construction of two façade towers and a choir extending from the prayer hall. The church was classified as a historical monument by the French administration in 1908 and returned to Islamic worship after Algeria's independence.\nJamaa al-Jdid is one of the more recent mosques, built in 1660 by Dey Mustapha Pacha in a style reminiscent of the Ottomans. It features domes similar to those found in Istanbul. However, its 27-meter-high minaret is in the Maghrebi style with a distinctive feature: since 1853, it has had a clock taken from the old Jenina Palace, which was demolished during the colonial period. It was designated for the Turks in the city, following the Hanafi rite, and its proximity to the sea earned it the nickname \"the Fishermen's Mosque.\" According to legend, a Christian captive designed its plans, which would explain its Latin cross shape. Its interior is adorned with woodwork, and its minbar is made of Italian marble.\n\nJamaa el Berrani, literally \"the Mosque of Foreigners,\" was built in 1653 and rebuilt in 1818 by Hussein Dey at the foot of the Algiers citadel to serve as the Agha's tribunal. It was named after the foreigners who came to pray there before their audience with the dey. Later, it was converted into a Catholic place of worship during part of the colonial period.The Casbah also has many small mosques, such as the Ali Bitchin Mosque, built by a Venetian renegade who converted to Islam, whose real name was Picenio. This mosque was constructed in 1622 by the wealthy merchant. It follows the Ottoman architectural style, featuring numerous domes, but also includes a square-shaped Maghrebi minaret. Originally, its prayer hall was unadorned, with walls simply whitewashed. Over time, however, stucco and other interior decorations were added. Currently, the building is undergoing restoration. Other mosques were built near mausoleums, such as the Jamaa Sidi Abderrahmane, erected beside the mausoleum of the same name in 1696. This mosque features domes and a richly decorated minaret.\n\nThe Casbah also had mosques that were demolished during the colonial period, leaving a lasting mark on the city's memory. Among them was the Es-Sayida Mosque (Mosque of the Lady), formerly located at Place des Martyrs, which was demolished in 1832. Its colonnades were repurposed to create the peristyle of Jamaa el Kebir, the Great Mosque, in 1836, as an attempt to compensate for the unpopularity of its demolition and colonial modifications.\nOther mosques, such as the M'sella Mosque near Bab el Oued (demolished in 1862), Jamaa Mezzomorto (built by Dey Mezzomorto), Jamaa m'ta Sattina Maryam, and \"Notre Dame Maryam\" (destroyed in 1837), were also lost due to various urban developments. Jamaa li Houd, known as the \"Mosque of the Jews,\" was originally a synagogue built between 1850 and 1865. It was converted into a mosque after the country's independence, following the departure of the local Jewish community.\n\nMadrasas and mausoleums\nThe Casbah contains several madrasas, the most well-known being the Thaâlibiyya Madrasa. It was built in 1904 under the administration of Governor Charles Jonnart, who promoted the neo-Moorish architectural style, sometimes referred to as \"Jonnart style.\" This style is also seen in several contemporary buildings, such as the Grand Post Office of Algiers and the Oran train station. The madrasa was constructed in honor of the renowned 14th-century Maghrebi theologian Sidi Abderrahmane, considered the patron saint of Algiers. Before colonization, the Casbah had around eighty zawiyas and madrasas, most of which are no longer in use, while some have been converted into mosques, such as the Zawiya of Sidi M'hamed Cherif.\nThe Casbah is also home to several maraboutic figures, including Sidi Brahim, protector of the sea, whose tomb is located in the admiralty; Sidi M'hamed Chérif, known for his famous fountain; Sidi H'lal, the saint of Bab el Oued; and Sidi Bouguedour, considered the \"chief of marabouts\". The mausoleums of Sidi H'lal, Sidi Bouguedour, and Sidi Abderrahmane, along with the mosque of Sidi M'hamed Cherif, are currently undergoing restoration.\nThaâlibiyya Madrasa was built near the tomb of Sidi Abderrahmane. The mausoleum surrounding his tomb was erected in the 17th century and even received a visit from Queen Victoria, who, moved by the site's grace, donated crystal chandeliers that still adorn the tomb today. Sidi Abderrahmane is regarded as the patron saint of Algiers, and his richly decorated mausoleum features calligraphic inscriptions of Quranic verses on the walls.\n\nThis mausoleum, which includes a mosque with an outdoor cemetery, serves both religious and funerary functions. The cemetery also houses the tomb of Sidi Ouali, a saint from the East, whose legend claims he unleashed the sea against Charles V's ships during the Siege of Algiers in 1541. Other notable figures buried there include saints such as Walî Dada, Sidi Mansour ben Mohamed ben Salîm, and Sidi 'Abd Allah; rulers of the Regency of Algiers, including Ahmed Bey of Constantine and deys Moustapha Pacha and Omar Pacha; as well as renowned personalities like writer Mohamed Bencheneb (1869–1929) and the distinguished miniature painter and illuminator Mohamed Racim (1896–1975).\n\nCitadel and defensive structures\nThe citadel, which is the true heart of the Casbah, is situated on the heights of the medina, covering an area of 9,000 square meters, of which 7,500 square meters are built-up. Its construction dates back to 1597, on the site of a former Zirid establishment. It became the seat of the dey's power in 1817.\nThis complex includes:\n\nThe dey's palace\nA palace designated for the beys of Constantine, Oran, and Médéa, who were vassals of the dey\nTwo mosques, one for the dey and the other for the Janissaries\nA gunpowder factory, used for producing saltpeter and gunpowder\nThe remains of casemates and a former garden that housed exotic trees, rare plants, and an aviary for rare birds\nBastions and ramparts\nAn old harem\nA summer pavilion\nThe Agha baths\nA summer garden\nA winter garden\nThe ostrich park\nDuring the colonial period, the French fragmented the citadel complex to build a road, now known as Mohamed Taleb Street. As of 2015, the Algiers citadel remains under restoration.However, the citadel was not the city's only defensive structure. Originally, Algiers was surrounded by a wall punctuated by gates: Bab Azoun, Bab el Oued, Bab Jedid, and Bab Jezira. A broader network of forts (borj), built between the 16th and 17th centuries, provided additional defense. These included El Fanar in the port, Moulay Hasan (or Fort l'Empereur) in the hinterland, and Tamentfoust on the opposite side of Algiers Bay. Borj El Fanar still exists, along with the admiralty forts, though many others were demolished during the colonial era. On the waterfront, one of the last remnants of the city's historical structures is the Palais des Raïs. Its imposing seaside facade is still equipped with cannons aimed at the sea. The Casbah was originally enclosed by a defensive wall, of which only ruins remain, such as those opposite Serkadji prison.\n\nUrban decay and social decline\nThe Casbah faces challenges related to its status as an inhabited heritage site. Since the colonial period, it has been relegated to the background, progressively losing its role as the city's urban center. Demolitions have taken place to make way for new urban planning. During the colonial era, the old city was seen as an outdated, dangerous place—a haven for outcasts and home to a poor population. However, aside from demolitions in the lower Casbah and the construction of peripheral neighborhoods, the urban fabric remained largely intact, as the residents developed a form of communal management of both public and private spaces. This was in resistance to the Haussmannian urban planning model imposed by the colonial authorities.\nIn the post-independence evolution, the role of the inhabitants has been contradictory. Since 1962, the Casbah has become a zone of relegation and social decline. The maintenance of public spaces has lost its effectiveness due to the dwindling number of zabalines (garbage collectors) and siyakines (sprinklers who cleaned the streets with seawater), leading to an accumulation of waste and rubble. These deteriorations are partly due to the upheaval of the medina's population, as many residents arrived after independence without any \"urban experience\". The Casbah has also faced the exodus of some of its former inhabitants, the beldiya or \"city dwellers\". Additionally, the role of the Algerian state must be emphasized, as it has pursued an inadequate urban policy, with no administration establishing itself in the Casbah between 1962 and 1985. Consequently, the medina has continued to lose its urban centrality. After independence, the Casbah also became a refuge for migrants from rural areas, serving as an entry point into the city. It turned into a veritable urban ghetto, a repelling space that, paradoxically, lies at the heart of a city offering no practical centrality. The Casbah's population has thus been composed of the most disadvantaged layers of Algiers' society, while the housing crisis has perpetuated the district's overpopulation. Additionally, a cultural and identity crisis has emerged, with the introduction of concrete into houses and the loss of function of certain architectural features, such as the patio (west dar), which has been bypassed by new room-to-room connections. The patio was traditionally a gathering place for interconnected families. However, as it is now occupied by families who do not know each other and are reluctant to share their privacy with neighbors, these patios have lost part of their original purpose. Paradoxically, preservation plans that focus on palaces and bourgeois houses have allowed the overall urban fabric to deteriorate—terrace continuity has been disrupted, ceramics have disappeared, etc. This reflects a narrow vision of heritage from an administration that perceives the complex urban space as cumbersome. However, restoration efforts are increasingly incorporating the concept of social rehabilitation.\nThe insecurity and isolation of the neighborhood contribute to social marginalization, which in turn fuels the degradation of the urban environment. About 76% of the properties are privately owned, often as undivided estates (biens habous), complicating the financing of restoration and maintenance efforts. This legal situation hinders state intervention. Action plans are repeatedly implemented using the same methods, leading to repeated failures on the ground. This explains why heritage restoration has remained stalled for decades. Of the 1,200 Moorish-style houses recorded in 1962, only fifty have been restored, approximately 250 have collapsed, and 400 are sealed off and unoccupied—although about 50% have been illegally reoccupied.\nThe repeated failure of rehabilitation plans is attributed to the lack of a comprehensive vision that includes the perspectives of residents and key local actors, such as associations and the oldest inhabitants of the medina. Since these groups have not been involved in various rehabilitation projects since independence, many efforts have been compromised. Additionally, projects are often assigned to foreign firms that struggle to integrate local architectural knowledge, reflecting what some perceive as a \"colonized complex\" within Algerian authorities, who appear unable to mobilize local expertise. Meanwhile, community organizations protest what they call a \"culture of forgetting\", but their concrete actions remain limited.\n\n2018-2019: Rehabilitation project and controversy\nIn the late 2010s, the Île-de-France region—twinned with the Wilaya of Algiers—provided financial support for a Casbah rehabilitation project led by architect Jean Nouvel. This sparked criticism, with a petition signed by 400 Algerians (mainly from the diaspora) denouncing the fact that he was from the former colonial power. In Le Huffington Post, architect Kamel Louafi sharply responded: \"All these signatories who act and work outside their country deny Jean Nouvel this right and ask him to let Algerian colleagues take care of the Casbah, as if intelligence were determined by birth or ethnicity.\"\n\nCulture\nHandicrafts\nThe handicraft sector in the Casbah is in decline. It has received no effective support policies, and combined with a struggling tourism industry, its current state is at odds with the once-flourishing history of the old city. The remaining master artisans are few, and traditional crafts face tax burdens and rising material costs. For example, brassware (dinanderie) is affected by a shrinking number of artisans, a scarcity of raw materials, and the rising price of copper sheets. Additionally, traditional handcrafted objects are increasingly being displaced by manufactured goods.\n\nDuring the Regency of Algiers, artisans were under the authority of the caïd el blad (city commissioner), a high-ranking official close to the dey. Specialized districts—or rather, narrow streets (zenkat)—were dedicated to specific trades. Shops and artisan guilds that were still active at the end of the 19th century had largely disappeared by the years leading up to World War I.One of Algiers' most renowned artisanal crafts is brassware, which dates back to the medieval period. Brassworkers (dinandiers) traditionally produce sniwa (richly decorated copper trays with geometric patterns), mibkhara (incense burners), l'brik and tassa (ewer and basin sets), berreds (teapots), and tebssi laâchaouets (conical-lid couscous steamers). The motifs used include stars, geometric shapes, and floral designs such as jasmine. Lucien Golvin viewed Algerian brassware as an Ottoman legacy—or at least as having strong similarities with artistic traditions from former Ottoman territories. Some decorative elements, such as tulips, carnations, cypresses, and scattered flowers, support this connection, as they frequently appear on engraved or incised copper objects.\nThe Casbah is also an important center for woodworking. The technique used is chiseling, and sometimes painting, to create richly decorated chests, mirrors, and tables. The artistic woodwork of old buildings continues to be restored by local artisans. A particular type of chest (sendouk) made of painted wood is still produced in the Casbah. These objects are called \"bridal chests\" because they are often used, especially in rural areas, to store wedding trousseaus. They feature two handles on each side and a lock for secure closure. The ornamentation consists of Arab-Andalusian motifs, often floral in nature, occasionally replaced by depictions of animals such as roosters or peacocks.\nThere is still a traditional garment-making craft in the Casbah, producing outfits such as the karakou, caftan, haïk, and fez. Shops near Jamaa Li Houd are the only ones that still sell \"Algiers soap\" (saboun D'zair).\n\nThe cultural value of these crafts is beginning to attract interest from both residents and the state, which, according to artisans, is still investing timidly in tax exemptions and specialized schools. Some initiatives to create artisanal businesses are revitalizing these trades—for instance, the crafting and restoration of painted wooden objects.\n\nThe Casbah in the arts\nCinema\nAlgiers has been at the heart of a rich filmography, one that few capitals in the world could rival by the 20th century. Around forty feature films and a hundred short films were shot there over the course of the century. Notable examples include Sarati le Terrible (1922), Tarzan, the Ape Man (1932), Pépé le Moko (1937), Casbah (1938), Heart of the Casbah (1952), The Stranger (1968), Z (1969), and The Battle of Algiers by Gillo Pontecorvo (1969). Pépé le Moko is still regarded as a film that glorifies the Casbah, where the setting steals the show from actor Jean Gabin. The Casbah also inspired local productions starting in 1969, including La Bombe (1969), Tahia ya Didou (1971), Omar Gatlato (1976), Autumn: October in Algiers (1988), Bab-el-Oued City (1994), Viva Laldjérie (2004), and Délice Paloma (2007).\nThe distinction between local and colonial productions lies not in filmmaking techniques or aesthetics but in the portrayal of Algerians. French cinema before independence was often characterized by the absence of native Algerians. In 2012, the film El Gusto explored Algeria's musical heritage and Casbah culture through the reunion of Muslim and Jewish musicians from Algeria.\nLes Terrasses (Es-stouh), a Franco-Algerian drama directed by Merzak Allouache, was released in 2013.\n\nMusic\nMusical troupes\nThe Casbah of Algiers once had a vibrant daily atmosphere with street performances by various musicians and entertainers. Among them were baba salem troupes, which frequently paraded and animated the streets, especially during celebrations like Mawlid. These groups, widely popular, were mostly composed of Africans from the Sahara, often referred to as gnaoua. The Gnaouas typically wear multicolored Saharan garments, a shell necklace, and play instruments such as the guembri, sound box, karkabou, and tambourine. Nowadays, baba salem troupes have become rare, though they still occasionally perform in Algiers.\nAnother type of folk troupe is the zornadjia, which performs at festive events. They take their name from the zorna, a kind of oboe, and produce rhythmic music accompanied by the tbilat (a type of drum) and the bendir. These zornadjia troupes are particularly common at weddings.\n\nArabo-Andalusian music\nChaâbi (meaning \"popular\") music belongs to the Arabo-Andalusian musical tradition. Over time, it became a symbol of urban popular culture. This genre remains vibrant today, an art form that has endured through generations and evokes the image of a timeless city. Chaâbi relies heavily on secular poetry (qçid), which it revives and adapts to contemporary tastes. The instruments used include the Algerian mandole (a specific instrument invented for chaâbi), the oud (an oriental lute), the banjo, the violin, the tar, and the derbouka.\nThis musical style emerged in the early 20th century among the working-class communities of the Casbah, many of whom were of Kabyle origin from the countryside. As a result, chaâbi is heavily influenced by Berber accents and exists in the Kabyle language in addition to its Algerian Arabic repertoire. The founding masters of this art include Cheikh Nador, Hadj El Anka, and Cheikh El Hasnaoui. Algerian chaâbi gained international recognition through the famous song Ya Rayah by Dahmane El Harrachi, which has been translated and performed worldwide. The recurring themes in chaâbi include cultural heritage, ancestral laments, homesickness, and traditional festive and religious songs. This music is often played at evening gatherings in courtyards, especially during Ramadan. Hadj El Anka established the first chaâbi music class at the Algiers Conservatory in 1957.\nChaâbi is also a musical genre shared by both Muslim and Jewish inhabitants of the Casbah. Among the most renowned Judeo-Arabic singers is Lili Boniche. His song Ana el Warka was used as the theme for the French TV show Des mots de minuit on France 2. Initiatives such as the El Gusto orchestra aim to reunite and popularize the Casbah's cultural heritage on international stages.\n\nPainting\nThe Casbah of Algiers has inspired various Algerian and foreign painters, particularly within the Orientalist movement. As early as the 19th century, it served as a source of inspiration for artists such as Eugène Delacroix, who sought to immerse themselves in the atmosphere of the Arab city. One of the most famous painters of the Casbah was Mohammed Racim, a native of the district. His works depict the old Casbah, reviving Algerian folk traditions. Many of his paintings are now housed in the National Museum of Fine Arts of Algiers. The American painter Louis Comfort Tiffany also went through an Orientalist period and visited Algiers in 1875. Between 1957 and 1962, the painter René Sintès created a series of works capturing the Casbah. His paintings, particularly Petit Matin, La Marine, and Couvre-feu, reflect the turbulent atmosphere of Algiers during the Algerian War.\n\nCultural institutions\nSince the 19th century, the Casbah has been home to cultural institutions such as the \"National Library and Antiquities of Algiers,\" founded in 1863, which houses 30,000 volumes and 2,000 Arabic, Turkish, and Persian manuscripts. The Dar Khdaoudj el Amia Palace also serves as a cultural institution. It was the first town hall of Algiers between 1833 and 1839 before being repurposed by the General Government of Algeria as a \"technical craft service\" with a permanent exhibition of folk arts. In 1961, it became the \"Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions\" and was later renamed the \"National Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions\" in 1987. In 1969, Algiers hosted the first Pan-African Festival, during which the Casbah welcomed various artists from the African continent and its diaspora, as well as revolutionary movements such as the Black Panthers. The festival was reintroduced in 2009, a year when the Casbah's heritage was also highlighted.\nAfter its restoration in 1994, the Palais des Raïs became the \"Center for Arts and Culture,\" hosting temporary exhibitions, museum displays, and performances on its terrace, which features a row of cannons facing the sea.\nThe Casbah also hosts workshops and visits as part of the \"International Cultural Festival for the Promotion of Earthen Architecture,\" organized by the Algerian Ministry of Culture. In 2007, when Algiers was designated the \"Capital of Arab Culture,\" the occasion spurred discussions about heritage preservation and restoration. This event led to the inauguration of the \"Algerian Museum of Miniature and Illumination,\" housed in the Dar Mustapha Pacha Palace. Dar Aziza, a palace in the lower Casbah that was once part of the old Djenina Palace complex, initially housed the \"National Archaeology Agency\" and now serves as the headquarters of the \"Office for the Management and Exploitation of Protected Cultural Assets.\"\n\nWritten heritage\nAlgiers possesses a significant written historical heritage. In the 19th century, the city had several collections housed in mosques, religious schools (zaouïas), and private collections. Much of this literary heritage suffered the same fate as many buildings, undergoing transformations and demolitions during the colonial period. This era also saw initiatives to preserve and catalog these works. Adrien Berbrugger established a collection housed in the Algiers Library, founded in 1836. The manuscripts originate from both local and foreign sources (Egypt, Andalusia, Morocco, Turkey) and cover cultural and scientific subjects. By 1872, 866 volumes had been cataloged in various libraries, including those of the Great Mosque (Jamaa el Kebir), Jamaa al-Jdid, and the mosques of Sidi Ramdane and Sidi Abderrahmane. At that time, Jamaa al-Jdid alone housed 555 volumes, acquired mainly through donations from the deys of Algiers. The 1872 inventory revealed that Jamaa el Kebir had lost two-thirds of its 1830 collection. Further inventories were conducted in 1907 and 1911. In 1909, Mohamed Bencheneb published the \"Catalogue of the Great Mosque of Algiers.\" This collection includes religious texts, Quranic manuscripts, hadith compilations, biographies of the Prophet, Maliki and Hanafi legal treatises, theology, ethics, and grammar.\nAnother type of written heritage is the Tachrifat of the Regency of Algiers, also known as the \"Register of Noble Affairs.\" This document is an administrative compilation of records from the Regency. In 1830, registers found in the dey's palace and among high-ranking administrators were transferred to the Arab archives of the colonial administration. These records contain information on tax collection, the management of beylik (state-owned) properties, and religious endowments. They also include scattered historical accounts, regulations, notes on administration, Christian slaves, and tributes paid to the Regency by foreign nations. The Tachrifat is one such collection of archives, translated at the beginning of the colonial period. These documents, which belong to the pre-colonial administration, now form the \"Archives of the Former Regency of Algiers,\" housed in the Algerian national archives outside the Casbah. The National Library of Algeria, which preserves ancient collections, was originally located in historic palaces before moving in 1954 to a new site outside the Casbah. Today, its collections are kept in a modern facility near the Hamma Garden.\n\nWater in culture\nThe role of water in the Casbah must be understood in its historical context. Water distribution in the city intersects with architecture, engineering and local customs. The concept of aquosity—a quality of life related to water—is a defining feature of many Mediterranean cities. Beyond shaping the city's unique urban identity, water is deeply embedded in intangible heritage, including legends and folklore.\nIn the 17th century, Algiers boasted an advanced hydraulic infrastructure that sustained a population of approximately 100,000 people, making it a major Mediterranean capital. One of the first elements of this heritage was the \"sacred springs.\" The \"Fountain of the Spirits\" (Seb’aa Aïoun, meaning \"Seven Springs\") was a freshwater source that has since disappeared due to the construction of the waterfront. Because these freshwater springs emerged directly from the sea, they were associated with mystical beliefs. The djinn (spirit) of this fountain, Seb’aa Aïoun, was known among Sub-Saharan Africans as Baba Mûsa, also called Al-Bahari (\"the freshwater spirit from the Niger\"). The Aïn Sidi ‘Ali az-Zwawi spring was named after the saint Ali az-Zwawi, who died in 1576, and was mentioned by Diego de Haëdo. The water, believed to have numerous healing properties, originally flowed through his mausoleum, which stood outside Bab Azoun Gate but has since been destroyed. However, the spring still flows today inside a shop on Patrice Lumumba Street. Among the most famous fountains are those associated with marabouts (Muslim saints), giving them a mystical significance—such as the fountains of Sidi Abdelkader, Sidi Ali Ezzaoui, Mhamed Cherif, Mzaouqa, and Sidi Ramdane. Others, like Aïn Bir Chebana, are also well known. The fountain of Mhamed Cherif, in particular, is said to have the power to calm anxieties and worries if one drinks three sips of its water.\nWater fountains were also considered acts of public generosity and were thus referred to in Algiers' toponymy by the Arabic term sabil or, more commonly in the plural form, sebala. This term literally means \"charitable and selfless act\". According to Kameche-Ouzidane, the word originates from the Quran, where it means \"way, path, or road\", and is the root of the expression fi sabil Allah, which conveys the idea of a selfless and generous action. Over time, the term came to designate public drinking fountains and water basins established through individual generosity. Such donations ensured that the donor's name would be remembered and contributed to their spiritual salvation in what was considered a \"perishable world\". Many inscriptions on fountains highlight the importance of water and their role as a public utility. This utility was even more significant because, originally, fountains and natural springs were the primary sources of water, and they could never be privately owned. Donors, as well as palace residents, were strictly forbidden from building such fountains within their private residences. Another form of water supply came from numerous wells—around 2,000 wells were recorded for 3,000 households at the beginning of the colonial era—as well as rainwater cisterns located in underground chambers, which collected water from rooftop terraces.\nThe fountain known as the \"Cale aux Vins,\" now embedded in a wall of the Museum of Antiquities in Algiers, bears an inscription from 1235 that eloquently highlights the public utility of water and the benevolence of Hussein Pasha. This is evident in Gabriel Colin's translation:\n\nIt is through water that all life exists! The governor, Sultan of Algiers, Hussein Pasha, whose pious intentions always aim for good deeds and who, never straying from kindness, brings water everywhere, has made this water flow and built this fountain. By irrigating this place, he has quenched the thirst of those in need. Drink freely of this fresh water in honor of Hussein.\nHowever, out of the 150 fountains that were once operational in the medina, only about ten remain functional today. Referred to by the Arabic words aïn (fountain) or bir (well), they reflect a certain appreciation for public spaces and city life. For example, the \"Widows' Fountain\" (Aïn al-Ahjajel) was reputed to have the power to bring husbands to widows. These fountains are an integral part of the medina and, although many have dried up, they persist as sites of memory, especially through their names and their role in the old city's toponymy.\n\nOral tradition\nOral culture plays a significant role in Algiers' traditions, particularly through the practice of boqala. The boqala, in its classic form, is a short poem of four or five verses, either recited or sometimes improvised. Passed down through oral tradition or small written collections, these short poems constitute a centuries-old heritage. This poetry game oscillates between entertainment and divination. In the latter case, it is sometimes accompanied by a magical-religious ritual and is not exclusive to Algiers but is common in other coastal Algerian cities and their hinterlands, such as Blida, Béjaïa, Médéa, Miliana, and Cherchell. The content of a boqala is often a riddle, a mysterious text, or a wise saying, making it open to interpretation. These sessions are traditionally organized by women, although men can also participate. Gatherings typically take place around a well-prepared table, on house terraces, or in patios. They are usually held at night, on the eve of important days or certain days of the week—Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. Such sessions are particularly common during the month of Ramadan. The word boqala comes from the Arabic term for an earthenware jug used to hold water, which is placed over a brazier and around which various rituals may take place.\nThe sessions begin with an invocation: \"Fâl ya fâlfal djibli khbâr man koul blad\" (O omen, bring me news from all lands). The language used in these boqala games is Algerian Arabic, incorporating borrowings from languages with which it has been in contact (Berber, Turkish, Spanish, and French), as it is primarily an urban tradition. While the origins of this practice remain unknown, boqala follows a literary structure similar to written poetry and is characterized by stylistic purity, rhythm, and sound patterns that contribute to its popularity. It bears similarities to ancient Andalusian poetry, hawzi music, and traditional songs from Tlemcen. This literary genre remains widespread today due to its thematic diversity, which allows it to engage various audiences and adapt to different circumstances. Moreover, it captivates listeners' imagination, fulfilling a certain desire for escapism.\n\nCurrent condition\nThe ANSS, the conservation agency of the Algerian government, reported that 373 buildings in the Casbah have collapsed. Of the 1816 buildings that remain, 40% are ruined or in a critical state, and 10% are boarded up.\nReuters reported in August 2008 that the Casbah was in a state of neglect and certain areas were at risk of collapse.\nAlgerian authorities list age, neglect and overpopulation as the principal contributors to the degeneration. Overpopulation makes the problem especially difficult to solve because of the effort it would take to relocate the residents. Estimates range from 40,000 to 70,000 people, although it is difficult to be certain due to the number of squatters in vacant buildings. One reason that the government wants to improve the condition of the Casbah is that it is a potential hideout for criminals and terrorists. In the late 1950s and during the civil insurrection and struggle against French colonial rule it was the hideout for the National Liberation Army (Algeria).\nPreservationist Belkacem Babaci described the situation as difficult, but not insurmountable, saying: \"I still believe it's possible to save it, but you need to empty it and you need to find qualified people who will respect the style, the materials. It's a huge challenge.\" Restoration projects have been plagued by delays and endemic corruption.\n\nClimate change\nSince the Casbah of Algiers is a coastal landmark, it is vulnerable to sea level rise. In 2022, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report included it in the list of African cultural sites which would be threatened by flooding and coastal erosion by the end of the century, but only if climate change followed RCP 8.5, which is the scenario of high and continually increasing greenhouse gas emissions associated with a warming of over 4 °C., and is no longer considered very likely. The other, more plausible scenarios result in lower warming levels and consequently lower sea level rise: yet sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years in all of them. Even if the warming is limited to 1.5 °C, global sea level rise is still expected to exceed 2–3 m (7–10 ft) after 2000 years (and higher warming levels will see larger increases by then), consequently exceeding 2100 levels of sea level rise under RCP 8.5 (~0.75 m (2 ft) with a range of 0.5–1 m (2–3 ft)) well before the year 4000. Thus, it is a matter of time before the Casbah of Algiers is threatened by water levels, unless it can be protected by adaptation efforts such as sea walls.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe Casbah of Algiers plays a central role in the 1937 French film Pépé le Moko and the 1938 American film Algiers, in which the noted jewel thief Pepe le Moko, played by Jean Gabin in the French version and Charles Boyer in the American version, hides there after a heist in France, and he becomes a local leader, but as time passes, he begins to feel trapped in the district. Although in the American film, Boyer never said to costar Hedy Lamarr \"Come with me to ze Casbah\", this line was in the Hollywood movie trailer, and it would stick with him, thanks to generations of impressionists and Looney Tunes parodies.\nBoyer's role as Pepe Le Moko was already world-famous when animator Chuck Jones based the character of Pepé Le Pew, the romantic skunk introduced in 1945's Warner Bros. cartoon Odor-able Kitty, on Boyer, his voice – imitated by Mel Blanc – and the catch phrase \"Come with me to ze Casbah\" from his most well-known performance.\nThe Casbah of Algiers plays a central role in the 1966 Italian-Algerian war film The Battle of Algiers, co-written and directed by Gillo Pontecorvo.\n\nNotable people\nAbd al-Rahman al-Tha'alibi (1384-1479)\nAbdelhalim Bensmaia (1866-1933)\nMohamed Charef (1908-2011)\nBrahim Boushaki (1912-1997)\nAbderrahmane Taleb (1930-1958)\nDjamila Bouhired (born 1935)\nDjamila Boupacha (born 1938)\nMustapha Toumi (1937-2013)\n\nSee also\nKasbah\nMedina quarter\n\nGeography\nAlgiers\nMitidja\n\nHistory\nZirid dynasty\nRegency of Algiers\n\nAlgerian War\nBattle of Algiers (1956–1957)\nSerkadji Prison\nSaadi Yacef\nAli La Pointe\nHassiba Ben Bouali\nLittle Omar\n\nCinema\nPépé le Moko by Julien Duvivier (1937)\nAlgiers by John Cromwell (1938)\nCasbah by John Berry (1948)\nHeart of the Casbah by Pierre Cardinal (1952)\nThe Battle of Algiers by Gillo Pontecorvo (1965)\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nWorks\nHistory\nMontagnon, Pierre (1997).

          "summary": "The Casbah of Algiers, commonly referred to as the Casbah (Arabic: القصبة, Al-qaṣabah, meaning \"citadel\"), corresponds to the old town or medina of Algiers, the capital of Algeria. It is a historic district that has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1992. Administratively, it is located within the municipality of Casbah, in the province of Algiers.\nLikely inhabited since the Neolithic period, as were various sites in the Algiers Sahel, the first mentions of the city date back to Antiquity, when it was initially a Phoenician port, later becoming Berber and eventually Roman. The current urban framework was designed in the 10th century by the Berbers under the Zirid dynasty, later enriched by contributions from other Berber dynasties that successively ruled the central Maghreb. The Casbah reached its peak during the period of the Regency of Algiers, serving as the seat of political power. Colonized by the French in 1830, it was gradually marginalized as power centers shifted to the new city. During the Algerian War, the Casbah played a crucial role, as a stronghold for FLN independence fighters. After Algeria gained independence in 1962, the Casbah did not reclaim its former central role and remained a marginalized city area.\nAn example of Islamic architecture and urban planning characteristic of Arab-Berber medinas, the Casbah is also a symbol of Algerian culture, a source of artistic inspiration, and home to an ancestral artisanal heritage. Local actors continue to fight to preserve and sustain its tangible and intangible heritage.",

          "content": "قصبة الجزائر، المعروفة باسم القصبة، تتوافق مع مدينة الجزائر القديمة أو المدينة العتيقة، عاصمة الجزائر، والتي تعدّ من مواقع التراث العالمي لليونسكو منذ عام 1992. وتقع إداريا في بلدية القصبة في ولاية الجزائر.\nيعود تاريخها إلى العصور القديمة، حيث أنها كانت أولا ميناءً قرطاجيا، ثم بربريا وأخيرا رومانيا. تأسست في القرن العاشر من قبل الأمازيغ تحت سلالة الزيريين، وتم إثراؤها من طرف الأندلسيين. ثم وصلت إلى ذروتها خلال فترة إيالة الجزائر، التي كانت مقر السلطة السياسية. استعمرت قبل الفرنسيين في عام 1830، وهُمشت تدريجيا لأن مراكز السلطة نقلت إلى المدينة الجديدة. احتلت دورا مركزيا خلال الثورة التحرير الجزائرية، حيث كانت بمثابة معقل لاستقلال جبهة التحرير الوطني. بعد استقلال البلاد عام 1962، لم تستعد دورها المركزي، وأصبحت مرة أخرى منطقة مهمشة من المدينة.\nمثال على العمارة الإسلامية والتوسع الحضري للمدينة العربية-الأمازيغية، وهي أيضا رمز للثقافة الجزائرية، موضوع للإلهام الفني ومقر للخبرة الحرفية الموروثة. يهددها الافتقار إلى الصيانة واهتمام سكانها وإدارتها، على الرغم من تصنيفها من قبل اليونسكو. الجهات الفاعلة المحلية تكافح للحفاظ على تراثها المادي وغير المادي.\n\nجغرافية\nعلم المكان\nالقصبة هو الجزء المركزي من المدينة أو المعقل. وكان مصطلح « قصبة » يرجع في الأصل إلى أعلى نقطة في المدينة العتيقة في العصر الزيري. بالتمدد طُبق على المدينة بأكملها، والتي حصنت بأسوار وقت إيالة الجزائر، في القرن السادس عشر.\n\nالموقع والطوبوغرافيا\nتقع القصبة في وسط مدينة الجزائر، وهي قلب تاريخي. وتحتل المدينة موقعا إستراتيجيا تاريخيا نظرا لموقعها الجغرافي على مستوى الجزائر والمنطقة المغاربية. تقابل البحر الأبيض المتوسط، وهي مبنية على تضاريس مع قطرة عمودية يبلغ 118 مترا. القصبة عبارة عن سرح لمجموعة متشابكة من المنازل المبنية على منحدر. الشوارع الضيقة والمتعرجة تجعل من المنطقة خالية من السيارات، لذا التزود بالوقود أو جمع القمامة لا يزال يتم عادة من قبل الحمير. وهي تشكل مثلثا تنظم قاعدته إلى خليج الجزائر، الذي يعطيها، بنظرة من المحيط، جانبا من « الهرم الهائل »أو « المدرج الثلاثي ». المعقل، يطل على موقع المدينة العتيقة، ويعطيها شكل « المدينة المحروسة\"، تلقب بالجزائر المحروسة. هذه السمعة موجودة حتى أوروبا، في ذاكرة فشل تشارلز الخامس في 1541 واستمرت حتى الاستعمار الفرنسي في 1830.\nيرجع الاستيطان في الموقع إلى الفترة البونيقية، التي يرجع تاريخها إلى نهاية القرن السادس قبل الميلاد. في ذلك الوقت، سعى القرطاجيون لتثبيت سلسلة من التبديلات على الساحل الجنوبي للبحر الأبيض المتوسط للسيطرة على مختلف التدفقات التجارية، ذهب جنوب الصحراء الكبرى، والفضة الإسبانية، أو قصدير جزر Cassiterides. هذا الجهاز، سمى « المقاييس البونيقية\"، يسمح للملاحين بالعثور على ملجأ لهم ومكان لتبادل السلع. موقع مدينة الجزائر العاصمة، كان يسمى إيكوسيم، يمتلك عدة جزر تمكنه من أن يأوي مراسي وملاذات، في ذلك الوقت، وجد الموقع لضرورة العثور على صلة بين اثنين من المؤسسات البونقية المتباعدة بـ 80 كم، برج البحري (روسڨونياي) وتيبازة.\nالموقع محمي، من ناحية، من ساحل باب الوادي، ومن ناحية أخرى، خليج أغا الذي يتعرض للرياح الشمالية والشرقية، ويضم أربع جزر بالقرب من الشاطئ، أما على الشاطئ، فإن الرعن الذي يبلغ طوله 250 مترا بمثابة ملجأ. كتلة بوزريعة الجبلية توفر ركام الحجر الجيري، والأراضي المحيطة بالطوب والموارد المائية. وهذا الدور الذي تقوم به المدينة يؤكده الجغرافي القرطبي أبو عبيد الله البكري الذي ذكر في القرن الحادي عشر أن المدينة محمية بمرسى طبيعي، وجزرها وخليجها، وأنها بمثابة نقطة ملاذ في فصل الشتاء. الموقع في فترات مختلفة كان ملجأ للسفن التجارية، للقراصنة وقرصنة تفويضية\n\nالمناطق الداخلية\nتشكل كتلة بوزريعة، التي يبلغ ارتفاعها 400 متر، جزءا من الساحل الجزائري الذي يفتح على سهل متيجة ثم جنوبا إلى مرتفعات الأطلس، حيث تعد مدينة الجزائر منفذها. وتساهم هذه المناطق النائية في إثراء المدينة في مسار التاريخ من خلال إنتاجاتها الزراعية من الماشية وتربية النحل. ومنذ العصور الوسطى، ساهمت المدينة بحضور أصحابها الزراعيين، بطابعها التجاري وبوضعها كميناء هام للبحر الأبيض المتوسط؛ قامت بتصدير مختلف الإنتاج المحلي. تقع مدينة الجزائر أيضا على حواف منطقة القبائل وأصبحت من القرن السادس عشر، المكان الرئيسي لاستقبال السكان القادمين منها، بعد إزاحة بجاية، المدينة الهامة الأخرى في المغرب الأوسط. وبالتالي جذبت منتجين هذه المنطقة والقوة العاملة.\n\nالهيدروجيولوجيا\nالمياه التي تأتي إلى المدينة القديمة تأتي من جبال ساحل الجزائر ومن مناطق الماء الجوفية بالحامة، حيدرة وبن عكنون. يتم نقلها من قبل شبكة من القنوات التي يرجع تاريخها إلى وقت إيالة الجزائر، والتي لا يزال قائمة. يتم استبدالها الآن بشبكة توزيع أكثر حداثة، يعود تاريخها إلى أوائل القرن العشرين.\nدعمت القصبة بأربعة قنوات رئيسية خلال إيالة الجزائر، وبعضها عمل حتى بداية القرن العشرين. المياه تأتي من المناطق المحيطة بها: الساحل، تيليملي، حامة، حيدرة وبيتراريا. وترتفع المياه من المياه الجوفية بواسطة نظام من النورياس يتراكم في أحواض تضخ تدفق المياه. ويمكن أيضا استخدام شبكة من صالات التصفية لجمع طبقات المياه الجوفية الصغرى. بعد أن مرت من خلال القنوات، تتدفق المياه إلى الخزانات على أبواب المدينة نفسها بدءا نقاط للأنابيب تصل إلى مختلف نوافير. بنيت القنوات بين 1518 و1620 وتذهب من خلال فاهسنوت 3 لإطعام المدينة. فهي لا تقتصر على تدفق الجاذبية، بل تستخدم تقنية الأبراج تحت الأرض أو السيفون. وتتكون هذه التقنية من تمرير أنبوب الماء من خلال عمود في الارتفاع. إذا من النظرة الأولى أنه يبطئ تدفق المياه، لديها بعض المزايا: إخلاء ضغط الهواء، مواءمة ارتفاع المياه في مختلف القنوات والسيطرة النسبية للتدفق. تم العثور على هذه التقنية من تحت الأرض في القسطنطينية وفي بعض المدن من إسبانيا والمنطقة المغاربية.\nوتقع الينابيع في منطقة من نتوءات الحجر الجيري، النيسات والأوردة من الغرانوليتس يستريح على سرير ششيستوس. ويتم تزويد المياه، بالإضافة إلى المصادر والقنوات والنوافير، بآبار محلية بعمق يتراوح بين 50 و70 مترا، مثقوبة في طبقات الغنيس أو الصخر الزيتي\n\nالتاريخ\nقصبة الجزائر هي مدينة عتيقة قديمة والتي يعود أصلها إلى ألفية إذا أخذ المرء في الاعتبار الماضي البونيقي والروماني للموقع. وتعدّ ممتلكات ثقافية ذات أهمية عالمية بسبب تراثها القديم والتاريخ الذي تشهد عليه.\n\nقبل التاريخ\nليس لموقع القصبة آثار مستوطنة ما قبل التاريخ. ومع ذلك، وبالنظر إلى أن هناك أدلة على وجود مثل هذه التسوية في المنطقة المجاورة مباشرة (جبال ساحل الجزائر)، فمن المرجح أن هذه الآثار في الواقع ملثمين من التحضر الكثيف والدائم للموقع وكان أيضا مأهولة منذ العصر الحجري الحديث.\n\nفي العصور القديمة البونيقية، النوميديية والرومانية\nلا يمكننا أن نحدد تاريخ إنشاء مدينة الجزائر القديمة (إيكوسيم) من قبل الفينيقيين، على الرغم من أنه من المرجح أنه كان بعد نهاية القرن السادس قبل الميلاد. ويبدو أن اثنين من الموانئ أسستا في خليج الجزائر؛ أحدها روجغونياي (برج البحري) من الشرق، يسمح للملاحين بالإيواء من الرياح الغربية؛ الأخرى إيكوسيم (مدينة الجزائر) في الغرب، مأوى من الرياح الشرقية. من هذه الفترة، تم العثور على لوحة تذكارية بونيقية، في شارع القصر القديم في الجزائر العاصمة، تابوت حجري في عام 1868، في حديقة مارينغو، التي تحتوي على جواهر من تلك الفترة، وبالأخص العديد من القطع النقدية في المنطقة البحرية.\nهذه 158 قطعة بونيقية من الرصاص والبرونز، التي يرجع تاريخها من 2 إلى القرن 1 قبل الميلاد. التي تحمل نقش « إكوسيم » يمكن أن تشهد على اسم مدينة الجزائر القديمة. ووفقا لكانتينو، فإن الأصل البونيقي للكلمة إكوسيم يشير في الواقع إلى كلمتين مترابطتين: إ يعني « جزيرة » وكوسيم « بومة » أو في ترجمة بديلة « شوكة ». لذا فإن الاسم القديم للجزائر، إكوسيم يعني إما « جزيرة البوم » أو « جزيرة الشوك ». فيكتور بيرارد، بدعم من كاركوبينو، فضل الترجمة إلى « جزيرة النوارس ». كما تم اكتشاف بئر قديمة في منطقة البحرية؛ يحتوي على قطع فخار من عصور مختلفة. في الفترة القديمة، عثر على رفات تشهد على العلاقات التجارية مع الغرب المتوسطي (بلاد الغال، إسبانيا، جنوب إيطاليا) من الثالث إلى القرن الأول قبل الميلاد. ثم في وقت لاحق، مع الحضور الروماني في القرن 5.\nسقوط قرطاج، في 146 قبل الميلاد، لم ينطوي على تغييرات كبيرة لإكوسيم والتي هي جزء من المملكة النوميدية ثم تدخل منطقة نفوذ مملكة المور للملك بوتشوس وخلفائه. موريطنية، التي تتوافق مع الجزء الغربي من شمال أفريقيا، بقيت مستقلة حتى 40 ميلادية، حيث وجدت نفسها، بعد فترة من عهد الملوك الأساسيين مثل بطليموس الموريطني، تحت سيطرة الإمبراطورية الرومانية. اسم إيكوسيم (Ikosim) ترجم في اللاتينية إلى إيكوسيوم (Icosium) عند إستقرار المستعمر الروماني هناك في زمن الملوك، حتى قبل الغزو الروماني. وهكذا، شهدت المدينة الحاكم الروماني في وقت مبكر، كما يتضح في قاعدة فخرية باللاتينية بشأن الملك بطليموس، وجدت في الشارع الحاج عمر بالقصبة. يظهر نقش آخر يشير إلى بطليموس على لوح في مئذنة الجامع الكبير.\nفي 40 م، تم تخفيض موريتانيا إلى رتبة محافظة من قبل الإمبراطور كاليغولا. ويعتمد الإيكوسيوم على وكيل النيابة الذي استقر في قيسارية (شرشال). منح فيسباسيان امتيازات القانون اللاتيني لـإيكوسيوم، التي أصبحت مدينة رومانية.\nكانت المدينة التي يحيط بها السور القديم تغطي بالفعل تقريبا مساحة مماثلة لتلك التي احتلت خلال فترة إيالة الجزائر، ولكن المنازل تتركز بشكل رئيسي في الجزء المجاور من البحر؛ فإن المنحدرات الشديدة كانت تشغلها الحدائق. فوق المدينة المنخفضة الكثيفة، قد تشمل الارتفاعات الأحياء السكنية؛ وتحيط بالفيلات الريفية كلها. تم اكتشاف آثار مختلفة الأزمنة حول موقع القصبة، تظهر تخطيط الطريق الروماني القديم المؤدي إلى حي بلويزداد.\nالمدن السفلى التي تقع خارج المدينة وفقا للاستخدام الروماني تعطي إشارة أكثر دقة لمحيط مدينة إيكوسيوم. تشير المقابر التي تم العثور عليها إلى أن الدفن يقع شمال وشمال غرب المدينة، وهو ثابت تاريخي عثر عليه في العصور البربرية والتركية، وفي الوقت الحاضر مع مقبرة سانت يوجين، التي والخصوصية هي أن تكون على بعد كيلومترين من القصبة بينما المقابر تقليديا وضعت مباشرة تحت الأسوار.\nمن الصعب العثور على محاور المدينة القديمة بسبب العديد من التغييرات في النسيج الحضري. ومع ذلك، تم استبدال الجزء السفلي من القصبة جزئيا من قبل مدينة استعمارية حديثة، والتي تتبع مسار والطرق الموجودة بالفعل في العصور القديمة.\nلا نعرف الكثير عن الحياة الاقتصادية للمدينة في ذلك الوقت.\nهناك القليل من المعلومات عن القرون التالية، باستثناء اقالة المدينة من قبل فيرموس في 371 أو 372. تم تمييع التاريخ القديم للإيكوسيوم في تاريخ موريطانيا القيصرية بعد ذلك في الهيمنة البيزنطية حتى تأسيس المدينة الحالية - جزائر بني مزغنة - في عام 960 من قبل بلقين بن زيري، الذي فتح فصلا جديدا في تاريخ المدينة.\n\nفترة الزيريون والمغرب الأوسط في ظل السلالات الحاكمة الإسلامية\nتتوافق القصبة مع مدينة الجزائر، المدينة العتيفة، التي بناها بلقين بن زيري في عام 960 على أنقاض المدينة الرومانية القديمة إيكوسيوم، وتقع في أراضي قبيلة بربرية تدعى بني مزغنة.الاسم الذي طلقه بولوغين بن زيري يشير إلى الجزر التي كانت تواجه ميناء الجزائر في ذلك الوقت. وفقا للفرضيات الأخرى التي طرحها أبو عبيد الله البكري، الجغرافي الأندلسي الشهير، فإن الاسم الصحيح حوفظ عليه عن طريق التقليد الشفهي لسكان المدينة الذين يصفونه بأنه دزاير، والذي كان تكريما لزيري مؤسس المدينة. إلى جانب ذلك، سكان المدينة حتى يومنا هذا يسمون أنفسهم بـ دزيري.\n\nيصف ابن حوقل، وهو تاجر من بغداد، المدينة في القرن العاشر:« إن مدينة الجزائر، يكتب، مبنية على الخليج وتحيط بها سور. وهي تحتوي على عدد كبير من البازارات وبعض مصادر المياه الصالحة للشرب بالقرب من البحر، ومن هذه الينابيع يسحب السكان المياه التي يشربونها. في ملحقات هذه المدينة تجد حملات واسعة جدا والجبال التي تسكنها عدة قبائل بربرية. وتتألف الثروة الرئيسية للسكان من قطعان من الماشية ورعي الأغنام في الجبال. توفر الجزائر الكثير من العسل حيث يشكل مادة للتصدير، وكمية من الزبدة والتين وغيرها من السلع الكبيرة جدا بحيث يتم تصديرها إلى القيروان وأماكن أخرى. »المقدسي، الذي زار المدينة حوالي 985، إستعاد معظم ملاحظات ابن حوقل. وفي الوقت نفسه، لاحظ البكري أهمية التراث القديم للمدينة. ولاحظ وجود دار الملعب (المسرح والمدرج) والفسيفساء وأطلال كنيسة. ولاحظ أيضا وجود العديد من الأسواق ومسجد كبير. كما وصف ميناء محمي بشدة، الذي يرتاده البحارة من إفريقية وإسبانيا و« بلدان أخرى ».\nمرت مدينة الجزائر على أيدي المرابطين في عام 1082. بقيادة يوسف بن تاشفين، حيث بُني مسجد الجزائر المعروف باسم الجامع الكبير. في عام 1151 قام الزناتي عبد المؤمن بن علي من ندرومة بضم مدينة الجزائر إلى الموحدون، وأصبح خليفة الموحدين في كل من المنطقة المغاربية والأندلس.\n\nإيالة الجزائر\nشهدت القصبة في 30 أبريل 1827، المشهد الشهير المسمى « حادثة المروحة »، الذي استخدم ذريعة لاستيلاء فرنسا على مدينة الجزائر في 5 يوليو 1830 في عهد تشارلز العاشر. الداي الأخير كان الداي حسين. حل مكانه الكونت والمرشيل دي بورمون في يوليو 1830 بعد الاستيلاء على المدينة.\nالقصبة هي مدينة الجزائر في العهد العثماني التركي وهي مقر السلطان وتم بناؤها على الجبل المطل على البحر الأبيض المتوسط لتكون قاعدة عسكرية مهمتها الدفاع عن القطر الجزائري كله.\nوهي مبنية على طراز تركي عثماني تشبه المتاهة في تداخل أزقتها بحيث لا يتسطيع الغريب الخروج منها وحده لوجود أزقة كثيرة مقطوعة تنتهي بأبواب المنازل والقصبة تحوي عدة أزقة أهمها « زنيقة العرايس »و\"زنيقة مراد نزيم بك »وفيها عدة عيون مشهورة كالعين المالحة في باب جديد وبئر جباح في قلب القصبة وزوج عيون في أسفلها، وقد تم هدم جزء منها بعد الاحتلال الفرنسي عام 1830.\nإضافة لاحتوائها عدة قصور أهمها قصر الداي أو كما يعرف بدار السلطان وقصر الرياس وقصر خداوج العمية ودار عزيزة.\nوكذلك تحتوي القصبة على مساجد عديدة هي الجامع الكبير والجامع الجديد وجامع كتشاوة وجامع علي بتشين وجامع السفير وجامع السلطان وجامع سيدي رمضان بالإضافة إلى مساجد صغيرة كمسجد سيدي محمد الشريف وسيدي عبد الله وسيدي بن علي بالإضافة إلى ضريحها الشهير سيدي عبد الرحمن الثعالبي الذي لا زال يمثل مزارا كبيرا في حي القصبة بالإضافة إلى جامع كبير تم هدمه في بداية الاستعمار الفرنسي كان يتوسط ما يعرف اليوم بساحة الشهداء.\nوكانت القصبة عبارة عن حصن يغلق ليلا وله عدة أبواب في جهاتها الأربع أهمها باب الوادي من الغرب وباب الجديد في الجهة العليا وباب الجزيرة من جهة البحر وباب عزون من جهة الشرق.\nوالخصوصيات الأكثر تمييزا لقصبة والتي تمنحها كل الروعة هي الأرضية التي بنيت عليها، تتكئ القصبة على هضبة تنكسر من على ارتفاع 118متر أزقتها متشغبة وهندسة بيوتها خارجيا وداخليا يعطيها سحرا يرجعك لزمان زاهر قد مضى.\nكل البيوت تحتوي على ساحة مربعة الشكل مكشوفة بدون سقف في وسطها يعرف بصحن الدار وبئر ونافورة ماء من حولها بنيت كل شقق البيت في معمار إسلامي متميز وتتميز دور القصبة بنوافذ صغيرة مزينة بقضبان حديدية جميلة وتتميز دور القصبة أيضا بالتقارب الشديد بين بعضها البعض بحيث يسهل جدا القفز من دار إلى دار بل يستطيع الإنسان اجتياز القصبة كلها عبر سطوح المنازل.\nويبلغ عدد سكان القصبة قرابة الخمسين ألف ساكن.\n\nفترة الاستعمار الفرنسي\nدخل الجيش الفرنسي إلى مدينة الجزائر في 5 يوليو 1830. سيغير الوجود الفرنسي إلى حد كبير من جانب مدينة الجزائر. أحدث الفرنسيون غييرات في المدينة عن طريق هدم جزء كبير من القصبة واقامة « ساحة الشهداء » الحالية. أما القصبة، التي كانت تصل في الأصل إلى البحر، أصبحت تقع على خلفية المدينة المواجهة للبحر وعمارتها المروقة. وينعكس الاستعمار أيضا في تخطيط الشوارع الجديدة التي تحيط بالقصبة وأيضا تخترق مساحتها. معماريا، أدخال الاستعمار الفرنسي أسلوب هوسمان وهدم جدران المدينة القديمة.\nتمتد فترة عمليات الهدم حتى عام 1860م، وشهدت الفترة الفرنسية حركة إحياء عمارة إسلامية جديدة كانت من أشهرها المدرسة الثعالبية في عام 1904م، ومتحف البريد المركزي في عام 1913م، وانحصرت « المدينة المحلية » تقليديا في المسجد والسوق.\n\nمع بناء أحياء أوروبية جديدة، فإن القصبة، التي كانت تمثل مدينة الجزائر بأكملها في عام 1830، بدأت عتبر مساحة حضرية فرعية، بقايا غير مستقرة، لأن المركزية الحضرية (الاقتصادية والسياسية...) إنتقل إلى هذه الأحياء الجديدة. مع ذلك، إحتفظت بالمساحات الاجتماعية مثل المساجد والمقاهي المورية والساحات (رحبة) والحمامات. ولا يزال هذا الوضع مسمر إلى ما بعد الاستقلال، ولم تستعد القصبة أهميتها بعد.\n\nمعركة الجزائر\nالحركة القومية (الوطنية) التي تطورت في البلاد في أوائل القرن العشرين، تفاقمت في الخمسينات، مما أدى إلى معركة الجزائر. القصبة هي واحدة من معاقل القوميين (الوطنيين).\nفي عام 1956، انتخب من قبل « مؤتمر الصومام » أعضاء لجنة التنسيق والتنفيذ، عبان رمضان، العربي بن مهيدي، كريم بلقاسم، سعد دحلب وبن يوسف بن خدة، قادة حقييين قرروا الاستقرار في القصبة حيث يعتقدون أن لديهم قبضة أكبر على المتشددين من جبهة التحرير الوطني، وصلات أفضل وخاصة باقتناعهم أن العاصمة تفضي إلى الاختباء الكلي، مع مخابئها المتعددة، وكلاء الاتصال العديدة فقدوا في الكتلة والحماية من جميع الأنواع التي يمكن أن تستفيد منها. الجلوس في الجزائر هو أيضا أن يكون في قلب الجزائر وممارسة حرب العصابات في المناطق الحضرية، كما لها أهمية بالنسبة للقتال والإجراءات في الجبال.\nالقصبة هي الموقع الأساسي لـ « معركة الجزائر » سنة 1957.\n\nبعد الاستقلال\nمع استقلال الجزائر شهدت القصبة نزوح جماعي، أي رحيل عائلات هذا الحي إلى المناطق الحضرية أو البلدية، حيث الشقق الأوروبية بباب الواد والأبيار، أصبحت القصبة مساحة للمضاربة حيث يستأجر السكان ممتلكاتهم. تم استبدال السكان الأقدم من قبل سكان الريف الذين يهدفون إلى مغادرة الحي في أسرع وقت ممكن، بل إن بعضهم يحطم السكن طوعا للاستفادة من السكن الاجتماعي الجديد.\nجمع خطط الترميم كانت دون جدوى، بسبب الافتقار إلى الإرادة السياسية. وسرعان ما أصبحت القصبة فضاء مكتظ ومتهدد لا يجد دوره المركزي في مدينة الجزائر العاصمة. ولكن يبقى أيضا في نظر الشعب الجزائري رمزا لمحاربة الظلم ومكانا للذاكرة الجماعية. اليونسكو تصنف القصبة كتراث عالمي إنساني في عام 1992 ومنذ ذلك الحين شاركت في الحفاظ على الأماكن. وتشارك الجمعيات المحلية والمقيمون أيضا في استعادة الأماكن وحركة الحياة الاجتماعية. يخضع المعقل المطل على الموقع حاليا لعملية ترميم متقدمة.\n\nهندسة معمارية\nتبدو قصبة الجزائر كمثال نموذجي للمدن المغاربية التقليدية، التي توجد في الجزء الغربي من البحر المتوسط وأفريقيا جنوب الصحراء الكبرى. لا يزال المجمع الحضري الذي يشكل القصبة يحتفظ بنزاهته، على الرغم من مختلف الطفرات، وعموما، يتم الحفاظ على الخصائص الجمالية للفن الإسلامي والمواد الأصلية.\nلا تزال القصبة تحتفظ بمعقلها والقصور والمساجد والأضرحة والحمامات التي تمثل دائما هوية الموقع. الهندسة المعمارية في القصبة تشمل الموروثات العثمانية، التي يرجع تاريخها إلى فترة إيالة الجزائر، ولكن الهندسة المعمارية المدنية إحتفظت بأصالة المدينة المغاربية. ومع ذلك، تبدو القصبة كمكان ذو الطفرة. خلال فترة الاستعمار، هدمت بعض المباني لإقامة منازل على الطراز الأوروبي، ولا سيما على الواجهة البحرية وعلى حدود الجزائر الوسطى. القصبة أيضا تملك في محيطها مباني على طراز هوسمان تعود إلى الحقبة الاستعمارية، وتدمج في صنفها التراثي، وهناك أيضا بعض التغييرات في المساكن مع إدخال مواد غير أصيلة واختفاء الدائرة التجارية للمواد التقليدية مثل ثويا. إن تهميشها الاجتماعي وعدم فعالية خطط الحماية يجعلها موقعا مهددا على الرغم من تصنيفها من قبل اليونسكو.\n\nتقنيات البناء\nالجدران والأروقة\nجدران القصبة هي جدران عتيقة، وهذا يعني أنها تتكون من طوب رصت معا. يمكن أن تحتوي هذه الجدران على معدات مختلطة وتقدم مجموعة متنوعة من المواد (الحجارة والخشب...) واحدة من الأنواع المستخدمة هي السيطرة على الجدران بطبقتين، واحدة منها بالطوب القاسي، والأخرى بإطار خشبي ومرن؛ ;وهذا يعطيه ميزة للزلزال. يتكون الهيكل الرأسي من أقواس وأعمدة من الطوب. هناك نوعان، أقواس مكسورة وأقواس مدببة.\n\nالسقوف والأرضيات\nالسقوف يمكن أن يكون مبنية، أو هيكل خشبي. غالبا ما تكون الأسطح المبنية أقبية متقاطعة، والتي يمكن استخدامها في المناطق الداخلية مثل المداخل والسلالم أو المساحات الواسعة للمباني الرئيسية (القصور والمساجد...) وهياكل خشبية غالبا ما تنطوي على الأرضيات وعلى بعض الاسقف\n\nالفتحات والسلالم\nويمكن تحقيق المعابر في هياكل البناء عن طريق الأقواس، أو البناء، أو في أسرة الخشب أو الرخام. في الباحات، الأقواس هي في معظم الأحيان أقواس حدوة الحصان تشكيل طفيف. الدرج في كاسباه هي هياكل البناء مع هيكل خشبي. يتم سكب منصة مائلة على سجلات الخشب، والتي سوف الطوب تشكل الخطوات. وتختلف الزخرفة، ويزين الرخام المنازل الكبيرة في حين تستخدم الصفيحة في منازل متواضعة.\n\nالزخارف\nالدرابزينات الخشبية، فتحات الأبواب، تاج العمود، والبلاط السيراميك للأرضيات والجدران. بورتيكوس وصالات العرض تعطي خصوصية المعمارية إلى القصبة. ترتيب الأقواس المدببة هو نموذجي من تكوينها المكاني. الفناء هو مثال على هذا الترتيب، حيث الانسجام بين الأقواس يمكن أن تخفي الاختلافات الهندسية، شريطة أن يكون لها ثبات في الارتفاع (بدءا من ولادة القوس إلى مفتاحه ). الاختلافات في فتحات الأقواس لا تخل بالانسجام البصري لكامل. أقواس القصبة غالبا ما تكون من النوع المتجاوز؛ تشكل أشكالها، أو المكسورة أو المكسورة، خصوصية جزائرية\n\nالعمارة المنزلية\nالعمارة المنزلية في القصبة تمثل بيتا إنسانيا تقليديا من الثقافة الإسلامية وعمق البحر الأبيض المتوسط. التصنيف مستقر نسبيا بين القصر ومسكن حرفي متواضع. البيت النموذجي في القصبة يبدو مجمع، متجاور وله واجهة واحدة فقط. وتشير التقديرات إلى أن هذا النمط من بيوت المجمعة يعود إلى الحقبة الزيرية. مساحة سطح الأرض عموما ما بين 30 م² و60 م²\n\nللبيت دائما منظر مطل على البحر بفضل السطح، وعادة ما يتم توفير الضوء من قبل الفناء أو، في كثير من الأحيان، من خلال نافذة التي تواجه الشارع. باب المدخل لديه دائما شبكة للسماح بتهوية أزقة الطوابق السفلى بالهواء النقي. البيت الجزائري العاصمي يدور نحو الداخل، وبصورة أدق نحو فناءه (وسط الدار)، والذي هو قلب الحياة ويشمل بئر (بير). مكان مبهج للعائلات، والتي تتكون مع أربع عائلات في المنزل، أيضا الفضاء تقليدي للضيوف. الجدران عبارة عن منشآت بناء مصنوعة من الطوب الترابي غير المطبوخ وقذائف هاون تتكون من الجير والأرض السميكة. الأرضيات مصنوعة من جذوع خشبية ويتم بناء القواعد باستخدام تقنية قفز برميل. الغطاء مسطح، مصنوع من سماكة كبيرة من الأرض، حتى 70 سم في الشرفة، والطلاء يتكون من هاون يتكون من الأرض والمواد المساعدة الطبيعية، وكلها مغطاة الجير. نظام العادم من المنازل مياه الصرف الصحي هو الصرف الصحي الطوب الحقيقي تحت الطريق، والذي يتبع الموقع المنحدرة، الذي يعود تاريخه إلى إيالة الجزائر. يتم إجراء اتصالات مع عناصر الفخار التي تناسب معا. منذ الاستعمار تم تحديث الشبكة.\nينقسم طوبولوجيا منازل القصبة إلى عدة مجموعات فرعية هي « البيت العلوي »و « بيت الشبك »و « بيت الرواق »والقصور. بيت العلاوي هو الوحيد الذي لا يوجد به فناء والهواء والضوء يصلانه من النوافذ. بني على قطعة أرض صغيرة، الطابق الأرضي، وهو صغير فيما يتعلق مجموع الأرض حق الطريق بسبب المنحدر من الأرض، يمكن تخصيصها إلى متجر أو غرفة التخزين. الطابق - في بعض الأحيان طابقين - يضم غرفة كبيرة واحدة. للحصول على مساحة هذا النوع من الموائل واللجوء إلى كوربلمينتس.\nبيت الشبك غالبا ما يكون التبعية (دويرا) من منزل أكبر وتجتمع الحد الأدنى من القيود الفضاء. يقع الفناء الضيق جدا في الطابق الأول وهو مرصوف بالرخام، في حين أن الغرف معبدة ببلاط من الطين. تستخدم الجدران أيضا بلاط السيراميك والجير. المنزل مع الرواق هو نوع من التميز بامتياز من المنزل مع الفناء، تحولت نحو الداخل. في الطوابق العليا، يمكن أن تنتج من السطح إلى المنازل المجاورة، ولها في الطابق الثاني غرفة جميلة مع كبو (في كوربليد في الشارع في محور الغرفة). يزين الفناء والنوافذ مع بلاط السيراميك الملون مع الزخارف الهندسية أو الأزهار.\n\nطوبولوجيا المدينة العتيقة\nتعد المدن العتيقة الجزائرية جزءا من تطور النمط الحضري مع مرور الوقت. في الواقع، فمن الثابت أن المدينة، والفضاء الحضري، هي قرية تتطور نحو تصنيف حضري أولي، ثم حضري، من خلال التاريخ. الانتقال من نواة حضري أولي إلى نواة حضري تترجم شكليا من قبل الأفقي ثم المكثف الرأسي، وهو النمط الكلاسيكي لتطور المساكن على مر القرون 70.\nالتكثيف للا يتجزأ معين هو لرعاية جميع الفضاء؛ ثم يأتي تراكب وحدات بناء للحصول على الطوابق. الجزائر هي مدينة ذات تنمية متغيرة، وتقدم الدول المتعاقبة من هذا التطور. وقد وصلت إلى مستوى مهم من التحضر منذ فترة القرون الوسطى، وتشمل تصنيفا متطور من المباني تصل إلى أربعة مستويات فوق الطابق الأرضي، مع متوسط اثنين من المستويات في القصبة. على العكس من ذلك، فإن كاسباه دي ديليس، القديمة مثل الجزائر، يعرض تصنيفا للنمط الحضري الحضري، حيث سلالم المحكمة ليست متكاملة في مجملها لتلد فناء ولا تزال وسيلة توزيع عارضة المعمارية إلى غرف في الطابق 70.\nطوبولوجيا المدينة العتيقة هو كثيف أفقيا ومنطو؛ فإن منازل الفناء التي تشغل مؤامرة مركزية يمكن أن تكون مصطبة على جميع الجوانب الأربعة (هذا النوع موجود في الجزائر، البليدة، ميليانا وديليس). وتتشارك المنازل في جدار واحد أو اثنين أو ثلاثة مجاورين لبعضهما البعض. المساحة المحدودة للجزيرة، التي تتكاثر فيها المنازل المماثلة والمجاورة، تؤثر على التصنيف الفردي للمنزل. الأشكال كلها سمة إطار مستمر من القصبة، من نوع « تحمل ».\n\nقصور ومساكن\nالقصور الرئيسية المساكن الحالية في القصبة هي دار عزيزة وقصر حسن باشا وقصر مصطفى باشا وقصر أحمد بيه وقصر الحمراء وقصر خداوج العمية ودار القاضي ودار السلطان ودار الألفية وقصر الرايس، دار الصداقة ودار الصوف؛ يجب أضافة إلى هذا التراث القصور خارج جدران فحص مدينة الجزائر والمساكن التي تشمل تبعيات المؤسسات العامة (المستشفيات، المدارس الثانوية).\nأقدم القصور هو جنينة، دمره حريق في 1844. هذا القصر هو حصن بربري قديم، هو مقر إقامة الحكام المحليين في مدينة الجزائر في العصور الوسطى، وخصوصا الأخير، سالم التومي. وبالتالي فهي الأمامية إلى ريجنسي الجزائر العاصمة، وخلال تلك الفترة هو مقر السلطة. يطلق عليها السكان الجزائر دار سلطان قديم وهو مركز السلطة حتى 1817. ويبقى جزء فقط من هذه المجموعة التي تقع في ساحة الشهداء أمام مسجد كتشاوة دار Aziza75. قصر دار عزيزة هو نموذجي للمنازل في القرن السادس عشر في الجزائر العاصمة. ثلاث قصص عالية في البداية، فإنه يحرم من المرحلة الأخيرة له خلال الزلزال الذي وقع في 1716. ويقدم متجر الأرض في عام 1830 وخسر في عام 1832 الدرج المؤدي إلى الشرفة. يصبح، بعد بعض التعديلات، إقامة المطران تحت الاستعمار الفرنسي. دار عزيزة غنية جدا في زخارف الجدران المصنوعة من الرخام المنحوت. أنه يحتوي على فناء جميل مع نافورة، والمشغولات الخشبية، والفخار والجدران الشاشة الزجاجية الملونة.\nتم بناء قصر مصطفى باشا في عام 1798. خصوصية هذا القصر هو أنه يحتوي على نصف مليون لوحة زجاجية خزفية قديمة تعود أصولها للجزائر وتونس وأيضا من إسبانيا وإيطاليا. رخام النافورة يأتي من إيطاليا والأبواب من الأرز. وهو حاليا متحف فن الخط في الجزائر العاصمة.\nقصر حسن باشا هو قصر على الطراز المغاربي تم بناؤه في عام 1791 وأعيد تشكيله خلال الفترة الاستعمارية مع عناصر من الأنماط القوطية الجديدة والمستشرقة.\nيقع قصر أحمد باي في القصبة السفلى، في حي سوق الجمعة، مجاور لشارع حاج عمار. وهو جزء من جميع قصور جنينة. وهو مبني في القرن السادس عشر كمسكن للداي، مع الأخذ بأسلوب النموذجي بذلك الوقت. وهو الآن يضم مسار المسرح الوطني الجزائري.\n\nقصر الريس هو واحد من آخر الآثار من المدينة العتيقة الواقعة على البحر وترميمها هو الأخير. هذا القصر هو أنه من للقراصنة، فإنه يتناوب المساحات العامة والخاصة. وتتكون من ثلاثة مبان فخمة وستة غرف (منازل أكثر تواضعا)، مع زخارف مكررة كما يتضح من بلاط السيراميك، والدرابزين الخشبية المنحوتة، والأعمدة الرخامية والسقوف مزينة غنية. ويضم أيضا حماما تقليديا ومنزاه، وتراسا يطل على الموقع ويطل على البحر، وهذا القصر هو في الوقت الحاضر بيت ثقافة.خلال فترة إيالة الجزائر، تقع العديد من القصور الصيفية خارج الموروس في فحص مدينة الجزائر. ويحدد الفحص المناطق المحيطة بها وضواحي مدينة الجزائر. بل هو منطقة متميزة جدا من المدينة. وهو موقع مختلف القصور الصيفية والمساكن مع الحدائق. واحدة من أكثر القصور شهرة في هذا المجمع هو باردو، الذي يضم متحف باردو الوطني.\n\nمساجد\nومن بين مساجد مدينة القصبة في الجزائر، جامع كتشاوة والجماع الكبير والجامع الجديد وجامع علي بيتشين وجامع سيدي رمضان وجامع سيدي محمد شريف وجامع البراني وجامع سفير.\nأقدم مسجد في قصبة الجزائر هو الجامع الكبير، المسجد الكبير الذي بني في عام 1097 من قبل يوسف بن تاشفين على النمط المرابطي. نبي في وقت تأثير الفن الأندلسي على المنقطة المغاربية. أكثر ما يميز هذا المسجد هو قاعة الصلاة ومئذنتها. وتتركز قاعة الأعمدة الصلاة وترتبط ركائز قوية من الأقواس صدفية كبيرة، الفصوص لأولئك بلاطات وموحدة ومهذبة لتلك يمتد. ويزين المحراب مع الأعمدة والسيراميك. المئذنة، التي أعاد تركيبها من قبل سلطان تلمسان الزياني في عام 1324، هي ذات شكل رباعي، تعلوها فوانيس، مزينة بالسيراميك والنقوش الجميلة. الشكل الخارجي غير أصلي، وهو يتألف من أعمدة رخامية مع عواصم مزخرفة من مسجد الصيدا، كانت في ساحة الشهداء، وهدمت خلال الاستعمار.\nجامع سيدي رمضان هي واحدة من مساجد العصور الوسطى في المدينة، يعود تاريخه إلى القرن 11.\n\nجامع كتشاوة هو عمل فريد من نوعه، شاهد على تاريخ القصبة. بني في عام 1436، الفترة ما قبل إيالة الجزائرة، عندما حكمت السلالات الحاكمة الأمازيغية المدينة. بنيته المعمارية تجمع بين الأساليب المغاربية والتركية والبيزنطية. في الواقع، تم تجديد بنيتها خلال عهد الإيالة. خلال الاستعمار الفرنسي كانت بمثابة كاتدرائية قبل العودة إلى هويتها الإسلامية بعد استقلال البلاد. تم بناء مبنى أكثر أهمية حول 1613، تحت حكم إيالة الجزائر، ثم أعيد تصميمه مرة أخرى في 1794، تحت حكم حسن باشا. مستوحاة من عمارة المساجد التي بنيت في تركيا على الطراز البيزنطي. ابتداء من عام 1844، في ظل الاستعمار، تم إعادة ترتيبها للتكيف مع استخدامها للكنيسة الكاثوليكية ما أدا إلى اختفاء المئذنة مغاربية الطراز الي كانت مربعة في الأصل؛ تم بناء برجين في الواجهة وكذلك في تمديد غرفة الصلاة. صنفت الكنيسة كنصب تذكاري تاريخي من قبل الإدارة الفرنسية في عام 1908 وأعيدت لأصلها الإسلامي بعد إسقلال الجزائر.\nجامع الجديد هي واحدة من أحدث المساجد. بني في 1660 من قبل داي مصطفى باشا يشبه إلى حد بعيد نمط العثمانيين. قببه شبه تلك ال في إسطنبول. مع ذلك، فمئذنتها التي يبلغ ارتفاعها 27 مترا، على نمط مغاربي مع مكون أصيل: فهي على مدار الساعة منذ 1853، من القصر القديم في الجنينة، وهدم خلال الفترة الاستعمارية. تم تزيين الديكور الداخلي بالأشغال الخشبية، كما أن المنبر مصنوع من الرخام الإيطالي.\n\nيوجد في القصبة أيضا العديد من المساجد الصغيرة مثل مسجد علي بيتشين، تعود أصوله للبندقية واعتنق الإسلام، واسمه الحقيقي هو بيسينيو. تم بناؤه في عام 1622 من قبل هذا التاجر الغني. وهو نمط عثماني مع العديد من القبب ولكن لديه مئذنة مربعة ذات نوع مغاربي. في الأصل كانت غرفة صلاة غير مزينة، بيضاء بالجير. ولكن مع مرور الوقت أضيفت الجص والديكورات الداخلية الأخرى. حاليا يتم ترميم المبنى. تم بناء مساجد أخرى بالقرب من الأضرحة، مثل جامع سيدي عبد الرحمن، الذي بني بالقرب من ضريح يحمل نفس الاسم في عام 1696. يضم قبب ومئذنة ذات ديكور غني.\nكما شملت القصبة المساجد التي هدمت خلال الفترة الاستعمارية والتي تميزت بذكريات المدينة. أما مسجد الصيدا، الذي كان يقع سابقا في مكان ساحة الشهيد، فقد هدم في عام 1832. واستخدمت أعمدته في تطوير بيت جامع الكبير، المسجد الكبير في عام 1836. أما المساجد الأخرى مثل مسجد المسيلة المجاور لباب الوادي، في عام 1829 م، وهي جامع ميزومورتو، التي بناها دي ميزومورتو، وهي جماعة جامع مطر ساتينا مريم، وهي « نوتردام مريم\"، في عام 1837، (94). جامع لي هود، « المسجد اليهودي\"، هو كنيس بني بين 1850 و1865، الذي يصبح مسجدا على استقلال البلاد، بعد رحيل الجالية اليهودية المحلية.\n\nالمعقل والهياكل الدفاعية\nالقصبة في حد ذاتها معقل، على مرتفعات المدية العتيقة، وتمتد أكثر من 9000 م2 مع 7500 م2. يعود تاريخ بنائها إلى عام 1597، على موقع مؤسسة الزيريون. أصبح مقر سلطة داي الجزائر في 1817.\nوهي مجمع مباني تضم:\n\nقصر الداي ؛\nقصر مخصص ببايات قسنطينة، هران، المدية، التابعين للداي ؛\nمسجدين، أحدهما للداي والآخر للإنكشاريين ؛\nالمخزن، وهي مؤسسة عسكرية لتصنيع الملح الصخري والبارود؛\nما تبقى من ملاجئ وحديقة قديمة حيث وجدت أشجار غريبة والنباتات للأبحاث وقفص الطيور النادرة.\nخلال الفترة الاستعمارية، هدم الفرنسيون كل المباني التي شكلت المعاقل من أجل إنشاء طريق، حاليا شارع محمد طالب. معقل الجزائر لايزال قيد الترميم في عام 2015.\n\nالمعقل ليس الهيكل الدفاعي الوحيد. وتحيط المدينة في الأصل بوابات باب عزون وباب الوادي وباب جديد وباب جزيرة. دفاعا عن نظام أوسع من الحصون (بورج)، الذي أنشئ من القرن السادس عشر إلى القرن السابع عشر، كتلك الموجودة في الفنار في الميناء، ومولاي حسن (أو حصن الإمبراطور) في المناطق النائية، وتامنتفوست على الجانب الآخر من خليج الجزائر. برج الفنار لا يزال موجودا، تماما مثل الحصون من الأميرالية، ولكن العديد من هدمت خلال الفترة الاستعمارية. على شاطئ البحر، واحد من آخر شهود من هياكل المدينة هو قصر الأشعة. الواجهة البحرية للمظهر الضخم تحتوي على مدفع يواجه البحر. وقد حاصرت القصبة في القاعدة جدار محيطي، لا توجد به سوى بقايا، مثل سجن سيركادجي المقابل.\n\nتدهور المباني والتدهور الاجتماعي\nتواجه القصبة تحديات متعلقة بمكانتها باعتبارها تراثا مأهولة بالسكان. منذ الفترة الاستعمارية، تم نقلها إلى الخلفية، وفقدت تدريجيا دورها كمركز حضري. وهي تعاني من عمليات الهدم لإفساح المجال أمام التحضر الجديد.وينظر إلى البلدة القديمة، في الحقبة الاستعمارية، باعتبارها مهجور: مخبأ خطير ومكان هامشي للسكان الفقراء. ولكن وبصرف النظر عن هدم القصبة السفلى وبناء المناطق النائية، لم يعاني المبنى من أي تدهور كبير خلال هذه الفترة لأنه ظهر بين السكان « شكلا من أشكال الإدارة المجتمعية للمساحات العامة والخاصة »في مقاومة نموذج هوسمان الحضرية التي تروج لها السلطات الاستعمارية.\n\nالثقافة\nالحرف\nالقصبة في الفنون\nالسينما\nمدينة الجزائر هي قلب سينمائي غني. تم تصوير أربعين فيلما روائيا ومئة فيلم قصير في القرن العشرين، أشهرهم فيلمزاد (1969) ومعركة الجزائر لجيلو بونتيكورفو (1969). استلهت القصبة الإنتاج المحلي من عام 1969، تحيا يا ديدو (1971)، عمر قاتلاتو (1976)، الخريف، أكتوبر في الجزائر (1988)، مدينة باب الوادي (1994).\n\nاللحات\nألهمت قصبة الجزائر العديد من الرسامين الجزائريين والأجانب، خاصة من خلال الاستشراق الحالي. في القرن ال 19، كانت مصدر إلهام للفنانين مثل الرسام يوجين يوجين ديلاكروا. واحد من أشهر الرسامين الذين رسمو القصبة هو محمد راسم، وهو ابن القصبة. أعماله توضح الفترة الأولى من القصبة من خلال العودة إلى التقليد الشعبي الجزائري؛ هي الآن، في معظمها، محفوظة في متحف الجزائر العاصمة. لويس كومفورت تيفاني، رسام أمريكي، عرف أيضا فترة الاستشراق وزار مدينة الجزائر في عام 1875. بين عامي 1957 و1962، رسم الرسام رينيه سينتيس القصبة. تعكس لوحاته، ولا سيما بوتت ماتين، لا مارين وكيرفيو  جو الاضطرابات في مدينة الجزائر خلال ثورة التحرير الجزائرية.\n\nالمؤسسات الثقافية\nمنذ القرن التاسع عشر، ضمت القصبة مؤسسات ثقافية مثل « المكتبة الوطنية والآثار في الجزائر\"، التي تأسست في عام 1863، وتحتوي على 30,000 مجلد و2000 مخطوط عربي وتركي وفارسي. قصر دار خداودج العمية هو أيضا مؤسسة ثقافية. مقر أول بلدية في الجزائر العاصمة بين عامي 1833 و1839، تنسبه الحكومة العامة للجزائر دور « الخدمة التقنية للحرفية\"، ويوجد معرض دائم للفنون الشعبية يستقر هناك. في عام 1961 أصبح « متحف الفنون الشعبية والتقاليد\"، وفي عام 1987، « المتحف الوطني للفنون والتقاليد الشعبية »133. في عام 1969، استضافت الجزائر الطبعة الأولى من مهرجان اتحاد أفريقيا في الجزائر العاصمة. في هذه المناسبة، رحبت القصبة بفنانين مختلفين من القارة أو الشتات الأفريقي، وأيضا الحركات الثورية مثل حزب الفهود السود. تم إعادة جدولة هذا المهرجان في عام 2009، عندما يتم تكريم تراث القصبة أيضا.\nيضم قصر الرياس، بعد ترميمه في عام 1994، « مركز الفنون والثقافة\"، حيث تقام المعارض المؤقتة والمتاحف والعروض على الشرفة التي تطل على البحر.\nكما تستضيف القصبة بعض ورش العمل والزيارات إلى « المهرجان الثقافي الدولي لتعزيز هياكل الأرض\"، الذي نظمته وزارة الثقافة الجزائرية. في عام 2007، تم تعيين الجزائر العاصمة « عاصمة للثقافة العربية\"، وهي فرصة لإعادة تنشيط مسألة التراث وترميمه. يشهد هذا الحدث الثقافي افتتاح « المتحف الجزائري المصغر والإضاءة\"، الذي تم تركيبه في قصر دار مصطفى باشا. دار عزيزة، قصر القصبة السفلى، جزء من الفرقة السابقة لقصر جنينة، هو مقر « الوكالة الوطنية للآثار »قبل أن يصبح مقر « مكتب الإدارة واستغلال الممتلكات الثقافية المحمية ».\n\nالتراث المكتوب\nتتمتع مدينة الجزائر بتراث تاريخي كتابي مهم. في عام 1872، كان هناك 866 مجلدا في مكتبات مختلفة: جامع الكبير، جامع الجديد، سيدي رمضان وسيدي عبد الرحمن. جامع الجديد ظم في ذلك الوقت 555 مجدلا، المكتسبة من تبرعات دايات الجزائر. فقد جامع جديد على ما يبدو ثلثي المجموعة في عام 1830.\nنوع آخر من التراث المكتوب هو التشريفات من إيالة الجزائر. وهو سجل وتجميع للبيانات الإدارية للأيالة. في عام 1830، يتم إيداع السجلات الموجودة في قصر الداي والمسؤولين الرئيسيين في الأرشيف العربي للعقارات. تتعلق هذه السجلات بجمع الضرائب وإدارة ممتلكات البيليك. هناك معلومات متناثرة، وعلاقات من الحقائق التاريخية أو الأحداث الملحوظة، وعلى مختلف الأشياء، الملاحظات على الإدارة، والجزيرة التي دفعت إلى الإيالة من قبل مختلف الدول.\n\nالماء في الثقافة\nيجب وضع دور الماء في القصبة ضمن البعد التاريخي. توزيع الماء في المدينة يعتمد على عدة مجالات من بينها الهندسة المعمارية والهندسة. وتشكل جودة الحياة « المرتبطة بالمياه\"، التي تعرف المياه، تحديا خاصا للعديد من مدن البحر الأبيض المتوسط. وتساهم المياه، بالإضافة إلى المشاركة في الأصالة الحضرية للمدينة، في إطعام التراث غير المادي بأكمله\n\nمعالم القصبة\nالتاريخ\nالوصاية

          "content": "Timgad (Arabic: تيمقاد, romanized: Tīmqād, known as Marciana Traiana Thamugadi) was a Roman city in the Aurès Mountains of Algeria. It was founded by the Roman Emperor Trajan around 100 AD. The full name of the city was Colonia Marciana Ulpia Traiana Thamugadi. Emperor Trajan named the city in commemoration of his mother Marcia, eldest sister Ulpia Marciana, and father Marcus Ulpius Traianus.\nLocated in modern-day Algeria, about 35 kilometers (22 mi) east of the city of Batna, the ruins are noteworthy for representing one of the best extant examples of the grid plan as used in Roman town planning. Timgad was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982.\n\nName\nIn the former name of Timgad, Marciana Traiana Thamugadi, the first part – Marciana Traiana – is Roman and refers to the name of its founder, Emperor Trajan and his sister Marciana. The second part of the name – Thamugadi – \"has nothing Latin about it\". Thamugadi is the Berber name of the place where the city was built, to read Timgad plural form of Tamgut, meaning \"peak\" or \"summit\".\n\nHistory\nThe city was founded as a military colony by the emperor Trajan in the year 100 AD. It was intended to serve primarily as a Roman bastion against the Berbers in the nearby Aures Mountains, and it was originally populated largely by Roman veterans and colonists. Although most of them had never seen Rome before, and Timgad was hundreds of miles away from the Italian city, it invested heavily in Roman culture and identity.\nThe city enjoyed a peaceful existence for the first several hundred years and became a center of Christian activity starting in the 3rd century, and a Donatist center in the 4th century. During the Christian period, Timgad was a diocese which became renowned at the end of the 4th century when Bishop Optat became the spokesman for the Donatist movement. After Optat, Thamugadai had two bishops Gaudentius (Donatist) and Faustinus (Catholic).\nIn the 5th century, the city was sacked by the Vandals before falling into decline. Timgad was destroyed at the end of the 5th century by Berber tribes from the Aurès Mountains. In 539 AD, during the Moorish wars, the Byzantine general Solomon retook and rebuilt the city, incorporating it into Byzantine North Africa. The reconquest revived some activities in the city, which became part of a line of defense against the Moors. However, the early Muslim conquests brought about the final ruin of Thamugadi as it ceased to be inhabited by the 8th century.\nTravelling Northern Africa, Scottish explorer James Bruce reached the city ruins on 12 December 1765, likely being the first European to visit the site in centuries and described the city as “a small town, but full of elegant buildings.” In 1790, he published the book Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile, where he described what he had found in Timgad. The book was met with skepticism in Great Britain, until 1875 when Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain's consul in Algiers, inspired by Bruce's account, visited the site. In 1877 Playfair described Timgad in more detail in his book Travels in the Footsteps of Bruce in Algeria and Tunis. According to Playfair, “These hills are covered with countless numbers of the most interesting mega-lithic remains”. The French colonists took control of the site in 1881, began investigations and maintained it until 1960. During this period, the site was systematically excavated.\n\nIt was by decision of the Ministry of Public Education and Fine Arts that excavations began in the 1880s in Timgad, and a post of chief architect of historical monuments of Algeria was created, with the aim of managing the service of historical monuments of Algeria and taking care of the excavation and restoration sites.\n\nDescription\nLocated at the intersection of six roads, the city was walled but not fortified.\nOriginally designed for a population of around 15,000, the city quickly outgrew its original specifications and spilled beyond the orthogonal grid in a more loosely organized fashion.\nAt the time of its founding, the area surrounding the city was a fertile agricultural area, about 1000 meters above sea level.\nThe original Roman grid plan is magnificently visible in the orthogonal design, highlighted by the decumanus maximus (east–west-oriented street) and the cardo (north–south-oriented street) lined by a partially restored Corinthian colonnade. The cardo does not proceed completely through the city but instead terminates in a forum at the intersection with the decumanus.\nAt the west end of the decumanus rises a 12 m high triumphal arch, called the Arch of Trajan, which was partially restored in 1900. The arch is principally of sandstone, and is of the Corinthian order with three arches, the central one being 11' wide. The arch is also known as the Timgad Arch.\nA 3,500-seat theater is in good condition and is used for contemporary productions. The other key buildings include four thermae, a library, and a basilica.\nThe Capitoline Temple is dedicated to Jupiter and is of approximately the same dimensions as the Pantheon in Rome. Nearby the capitol is a square church, with a circular apse dating from the 7th century AD. One of the sanctuaries featured iconography of (Dea) Africa. South of the city is a large Byzantine citadel built in the later days of the city.\n\nLibrary\nThe Library at Timgad was a gift to the Roman people by Julius Quintianus Flavius Rogatianus at a cost of 400,000 sesterces. As no additional information about this benefactor has been unearthed, the precise date of the library's construction remains uncertain. Based on the remaining archaeological evidence, it has been suggested by scholars that it dates from the late 3rd or possibly the 4th century.\nThe library occupies a rectangle 81 feet (25 meters) long by 77 feet (23 meters) wide. It consists of a large semi-circular room flanked by two secondary rectangular rooms, and preceded by a U-shaped colonnaded portico surrounding three sides on an open court. The portico is flanked by two long narrow rooms on each side, and the large vaulted hall would have combined the functions of a reading room, stack room, and perhaps a lecture room. Oblong alcoves held wooden shelves along walls that would likely have been complete with sides, backs and doors, based on additional evidence found at the library at Ephesus.\nIt is possible that free-standing bookcases in the center of the room, as well as a reading desk, might also have been present. While the architecture of the Library at Timgad is not especially remarkable, the discovery of the library is historically important as it shows the presence of a fully developed library system in this Roman city, indicating a high standard of learning and culture. While there is no evidence as to the size of the collection the library harbored, it is estimated that it could have accommodated 3,000 scrolls.\n\nWorld Heritage Site\nTimgad was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nDjémila\nJerash\nLambaesis\nColonia (Roman)\nList of cultural assets of Algeria\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nUNESCO site on Timgad\nGreat Buildings entry on Timgad\nImages of Timgad on Manar al-Athar digital heritage photography archive\nPhotos of Timgad\nInformation on Roman Africa\nMap Location of Timgad",
          "summary": "Timgad (Arabic: تيمقاد, romanized: Tīmqād, known as Marciana Traiana Thamugadi) was a Roman city in the Aurès Mountains of Algeria. It was founded by the Roman Emperor Trajan around 100 AD. The full name of the city was Colonia Marciana Ulpia Traiana Thamugadi. Emperor Trajan named the city in commemoration of his mother Marcia, eldest sister Ulpia Marciana, and father Marcus Ulpius Traianus.\nLocated in modern-day Algeria, about 35 kilometers (22 mi) east of the city of Batna, the ruins are noteworthy for representing one of the best extant examples of the grid plan as used in Roman town planning. Timgad was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982.",

          "content": "Timgad ou Thamugadi (colonie Marciana Traiana Thamugadi en latin), surnommée la « Pompéi de l'Afrique du Nord », est une cité antique située sur le territoire de la commune homonyme de Timgad, dans la wilaya de Batna dans la région des Aurès, au Nord-Est de l'Algérie.\nElle est fondée par l'empereur romain Trajan en 100 et dotée du statut de colonie. Il s'agit de la dernière « déduction de colonie » en Afrique romaine, c'est-à-dire d'une colonie essentiellement peuplée de citoyens romains (souvent d'ailleurs d'anciens soldats). Bâtie avec ses temples, ses thermes, son forum et son théâtre, la ville, initialement d'une superficie de 12 hectares, finit par en occuper plus de 90. Au vu de son excellent état de conservation et du fait qu'on la considérait comme typique d'une ville romaine, Timgad est classée au patrimoine mondial de l'humanité par l'UNESCO en 1982. La conservation du site soulève cependant un certain nombre de problèmes.\n\nToponymie\nDans l'ancien nom de Timgad, Marciana Trajana Thamugadi, la première partie — Marciana Trajana — est romaine et se rapporte au nom de son fondateur, l'empereur Trajan, et sa sœur Marciana.\nLa deuxième partie du nom — Thamugadi — « n'a rien de latin ».\nThamugadi  est le nom berbère du lieu où a été édifiée la ville, à lire Timgad, pluriel de Tamgut, signifiant « pic », « sommet ».\nLes mentions du nom de Timgad ont été retrouvées dans la Table de Peutinger, à l'intérieur de l'itinéraire d’Antonin le Pieux et dans des actes de martyrs, ainsi que dans des inscriptions sur place, comme au haut de l'Arc de Trajan jadis. Le nom est à l'accusatif et on peut lire Thamugadi, lorsque le nom a été transcrit par Procope ; la forme i finale est répandue chez les Africains et au génitif, c’est Thamugadis, à l'ablatif, c'est Thamugade et à l'accusatif, on obtient Thamugadem.\n\nHistorique de la ville\nLe site aux origines de la ville\nTimgad était située à 21 km de Lambèse sur la voie allant vers Theveste dans une haute plaine étroite s'étirant entre l'Aurès et le djebel Bou Arif. Il s'agit donc d'un site avantageux qui contrôle aussi les voies d'accès à l'Aurès par les vallées de l'oued Abdi et de l'oued Abiod.\nAu musée, la ville est à 1 040 m au-dessus de la mer et au fort byzantin, elle est à  1 080 m d’altitude.\nLe site est construit sur la pente du renforcement du mont Morris, au côté nord, sur une grande plaine qui est arrosée de l'est à l'ouest par l'oued Soutze qui est constitué par la source de Aïn Morris  et l’oued Merien, au loin également l'oued Soutz rejoint l'oued Taga et forme l'oued Chemora qui devient le lac de Chemora (Barrage de Koudiet Lamdaouar). Timgad était aussi alimenté en eau par la source de l'Aïn Morris à trois kilomètres au sud et peut-être aussi par la source de l'Aïn Cherchar à 11 km au sud-est.\nAux yeux des Romains la région doit alors faire partie de la Gétulie.\nCependant, selon Albert Ballu, Timgad se trouve sur le sol de la Numidie. Et au temps de Sévère, Timgad ne faisait plus partie de la Province d’Afrique.\nOn ne peut cependant savoir si un habitat préexistait à la colonie romaine ou s'il ne s'agissait que d'un nom de lieu.\n\nLa dernière colonie de déduction en Afrique\nC'est en 100 que Trajan fit procéder à la fondation de la cité par la Troisième légion Auguste et son légat Lucius Munatius Gallus. Les habitants de Timgad avaient donc tous la citoyenneté romaine et furent inscrits dans la tribu Papiria. La colonie prit le nom de colonia Marciana Traiana Thamugadi : Marciana rappelle le nom de la sœur de Trajan et Thamugadi, nom indéclinable et non latin, est vraisemblablement le nom indigène du lieu. On ne sait pas cependant s'il y avait déjà une agglomération africaine sur place : la fondation romaine se déploya cependant comme si elle se trouvait en terrain vierge. Le plan initial de Timgad, quadrangulaire et géométrique atteste que cette fondation suit les principes des gromatici, les arpenteurs romains. La rigueur de la planification de l'espace urbain fit que Timgad est souvent cité comme exemple de ville romaine, il serait toutefois erroné de généraliser à partir de son cas : les plans de villes romaines avaient d'abord pour principe de s'adapter au terrain et aux contraintes du lieu, le parfait déploiement quadrangulaire de Timgad n'est pas une règle absolue, et la colonie légèrement antérieure de Cuicul présente un plan moins régulier. La forte régularité du plan initial a donc parfois conduit à penser que Timgad avait pu être un camp militaire avant d'être une ville, la fondation coloniale réutilisant le tracé des cantonnements militaires : cette hypothèse n'est pas prouvée et rien n'indique que Timgad ait pu servir de camp provisoire à la troisième légion Auguste. La fondation de Timgad prend cependant pleinement son sens lorsqu'on la replace dans l'histoire des déplacements de la légion africaine[réf. nécessaire]. La déduction de la colonie se trouve en effet entre la première installation d'une cohorte légionnaire à Lambèse, en 81, et l'installation définitive de toute la légion vers 115-120. Si Timgad est remarquablement bien situé, il faut reconnaître au site de Lambèse une meilleure position stratégique.[réf. nécessaire]\n\nRôle territorial\nOn a donc souvent vu dans la fondation de Timgad un objectif d'abord purement militaire. Il faut cependant très fortement relativiser la protection militaire que pouvait apporter une colonie de vétérans : passées les premières années, les habitants ne pouvaient guère fournir une force militaire particulière. En revanche la colonie pouvait avoir un rôle militaire indirect : elle pouvait constituer, à terme, un milieu de recrutement pour la légion voisine et surtout par ses productions agraires - céréales et olives - assurer une partie non négligeable de son ravitaillement. Enfin, l'installation de la colonie de Timgad a longtemps été conçue en fonction d'une image erronée du massif de l'Aurès à l'époque romaine.[réf. nécessaire]\nOn pensa en effet souvent, jusque dans les années 1960-1970, que le massif n'avait pas été pénétré par Rome, et qu'en conséquence il avait constitué un foyer de rébellion et une menace, à l'instar d'autres périodes de l'histoire, et l'on interprétait le dispositif militaire romain comme l'encerclement du massif.[réf. nécessaire] Les prospections archéologiques et l'analyse des photographies aériennes menées par Pierre Morizot ont apporté un démenti à cette image : l'Aurès était cultivé, occupé par un habitat dispersé et la présence militaire y était faible et très ponctuelle. L'archéologie révèle donc une montagne tranquille, sans troubles sérieux, à la vocation essentiellement rurale, à la richesse modeste, mais ouverte à la romanisation et plus tard à la christianisation. Une partie du massif, la vallée de l'oued Taga appartenait donc au territoire de Timgad et constituait un piémont aux productions complémentaires des terroirs céréaliers plus proches de Timgad : olive, bois et petit bétail.[réf. nécessaire] La fondation de la colonie de Timgad ne peut donc pas s'expliquer en termes de nécessité militaire, mais participe plutôt de l'exploitation du territoire provincial et de son maillage par des espaces civiques conçus comme l'effigie du peuple romain, dans le cadre de la politique volontariste d'un empereur soucieux d'expansion. Timgad toutefois fut le dernier cas de déductions collectives de vétérans en Afrique, et par la suite les nouvelles colonies ne furent plus qu'honoraires, c'est-à-dire un titre conféré à une cité sans apport de population romaine.[réf. nécessaire].\n\nÉvolution de la ville\nLa Pax Romana en Numidie a contribué à l'adhésion des populations autochtones romanisées, les citadins berbères pouvaient gravir les échelons du résident, du citoyen romain de l'édile et parfois vers le cursus honorum et d'autres étaient classés équestres ou siégeaient au Sénat, ainsi Timgad faisait partie des villes nouvelles et l'Empereur Trajan employait des légionnaires numides également. La somme honoraire du duumvirat était de 2 000.\nAu départ, la ville fut construite par la volonté impériale et une colonie a été implantée. Timgad est une cité civile par rapport à Lambèse. L'absence du nom de la III légion sur le site et des noms des vétérans a été constatée. Au début, les vétérans étaient au nombre de 200 à 400 ou 900. Selon Tacite, les colons n'avaient pas la notion de famille, étant des vétérans militaires, les femmes autochtones ont joué un rôle important probablement pour former la première génération de colons de la ville qui compte environ 3 000 ou 4 000 personnes. De plus, il y avait des résidents et des esclaves.\nLa population est estimée par C. Courtois de 15 000 au début du IIIe siècle, après l'édification de toutes les structures importantes de la ville.\nÀ côté des quatre angles, à l'intersection des deux voies principales, sont édifiées les différentes constructions municipales. La cité est dotée d'un forum, d'un théâtre, d’un grand marché, d'un temple de Jupiter, d’un Capitole, de deux petits torrents secondaires et des ponts (aujourd'hui détruits). À l'ouest, le grand ravin, le marché et le capitole à droite. Au nord-est, l’Arc de Trajan. \nLa ville en tout a une superficie de 800 m2. Sous Trajan, probablement que la route entre Timgad et Theveste fut élaborée. Les unités d'habitation sont enveloppées dans une surface de 400 m2 avec permission de réaménagement.\nTimgad avait son évêque, après l’apparition du christianisme, pendant le règne de l'Empereur Valérien, entre 253 et 260, ou durant Dioclétien, entre 284 et 305, la ville a compté des martyrs. L'évêque Novatus de l’Église de Timgad a pris part à un concile à Carthage en 256. Trois Basiliques furent construites durant le IVe siècle. De plus, les fouilles ont prouvé l'existence de plusieurs chapelles, des baptistères, des oratoires et un monastère.\nLes habitants de Thamugadi avaient le souci de développer l'art. Plusieurs ustensiles portent des symboles chrétiens ou gravures artistiques, fabriqués dans les ateliers de la ville. Timgad avait ses propres ateliers de céramique et de métallurgie également. Timgad a vécu une prospérité totale, loin des luttes agitant l'empire, elle est citée seulement par des géographes tels que Ptolémée et Procope de Césarée ou par le clergé lors de rares querelles religieuses, de conciles et de persécution. \nLa ville a été une des capitales des donatistes de Numidie. Par contre, durant un siècle, les donatistes et les chrétiens étaient en rivalité à Timgad.\n\nPolitique municipale\nLes édiles ont prévu l’accroissement de la ville, la construction des voies reliant Mascula vers l'est et la route vers Lambèse. Ils ont élaboré la construction des portes sous forme d’arc afin qu'elles soient visibles à une bonne distance lors du règne de Marc-Aurèle, ainsi que des thermes au Nord proches de l'actuel musée et qui demeurent dans l'axe de la ville, près de la porte de Cirta. D’autres thermes au sud-est s'agrafent avec les thèmes du Sud. Un grand édifice l’Aqua Septimiana, bâti vers le milieu du IIe siècle et agrandi en 198 pendant le règne de Septime Sévère, situé devant le point d'arrivée des eaux du principal captage d'alimentation de la cité. Caracalla, en 219, édifie le temple des eaux, qui est un des plus beaux monuments d’Afrique, dans la zone du fort byzantin.\nDe plus, la sortie principale de la ville se trouve à l'ouest au départ de l'axe reliant Lambèse. C’est le travail de l'architecte Alexandre Lézine qui a fait que l'Arc de Trajan (Timgad) soit oblique par rapport au mur de la ville, une transition était ainsi indiquée entre la perspective de la voie décimane intra muros et l'avenue de Lambèse. Un espace fut aménagé en forme de trapèze pour plusieurs édifices importants, le premier pour la fonction religieuse, le deuxième pour le temple du Génie de la colonie et enfin un pour la fonction économique, le marché de Sertius, avec une large exèdre ouvrant sur une cour bordée de portique, avec des corbeaux sculptés à volutes et des feuilles d'acanthe, en forme de relief. Les constructions fussent achevées vers le IIe siècle.\nTimgad  s'étend sur 60 ha après la construction du fort byzantin dont 800 m◊ de ruine compacte.\n\nTravaux d'aménagement\nLa Curie avait été probablement édifiée sous Trajan, au début de l'organisation de la colonie, mais les travaux  auraient été entrepris d'une manière hâtive. Sous le règne d’Antonin le Pieux, la ville a été agrandie, elle s'est développée. Les responsables de la ville souhaitaient un cadre plus prospère, alors ils ont modifié la Curie, ils ont refait le dallage du Forum et ils ont établi un dallage près du Temple du Génie de la Colonie. Lors du règne d'Antonin le Pieux, la ville a connu d’importants travaux édilitaires.\n\nDestruction et restauration\nLa ville fut détruite par les Berbères, vers la fin de la domination vandale, en 535. Les habitants ont été chassés pour que personne ne puisse s'établir à l'endroit de la ville, tel est le court récit de 3 lignes de Procope où l'on mentionne Timgad. Après l'arrivée des Byzantins, la ville fut reconstruite en 539, une dédicace, trouvée dans les fouilles, prouve la restauration de la ville ainsi que la construction du fort byzantin et de la citadelle, lors de la campagne de Solomon. Selon une inscription, la chapelle du patrice Grégoire aurait été construite  vers le milieu du VIIe siècle. La ville aurait été catholique au moment de l'arrivée des premiers Arabes.\n\nLe territoire de la cité\nUne ville romaine n'est pas concevable sans sa campagne. Longtemps négligées par l'archéologie, difficiles à appréhender avant la mise au point de techniques de prospection à grande échelle les campagnes des villes romaines sont longtemps restées mal connues. C'est pourtant de son territoire que la cité tirait ses richesses, et de ces richesses dépendait le dynamisme des notables qui la dirigeaient.[réf. nécessaire]\nIl est possible de proposer une reconstitution de la composition du territoire de Timgad afin d'évaluer la répartition de la propriété agraire sur sa superficie.\nIl en ressort l'image d'un territoire finalement assez étroit : 1 500 kilomètres carrés, 150 000 hectares qui n'étaient pas tous exploitables, car des reliefs importants existent dans cet espace. À l'ouest en effet le territoire était assez vite limité, au bout d'une quinzaine de kilomètres, par celui des voisines, Lamafundi et Verecunda. À l'est la situation est similaire et le territoire de Mascula devait se trouver à une vingtaine de kilomètres. Au nord, sur environ 25 kilomètres, les recherches ont révélé un système de centuriations sans doute lié à la fondation de la colonie avec un parcellaire régulier témoignant d'une mise en valeur soignée. Au nord-ouest la plaine révèle des ruines nombreuses et donc une densité d'occupation importante.[réf. nécessaire] Au sud, il est plus difficile de situer la limite du territoire, selon Pierre Morizot il aurait pu aller jusqu'aux sources du Taga au nord du djebel Mahmel.\nLe territoire de Timgad pouvait produire des céréales, des olives, productions auxquelles il faut ajouter de l'élevage et l'exploitation des massifs forestiers.\nDe nombreux vestiges d'huileries et d'établissements agricoles sont attestés sur le territoire de la cité, ainsi à Henchir Taga les prospections ont révélé un vaste bâtiment qui était entouré de 7  à   8 hectares de plantations alignées.\nToutes ces terres n'appartenaient pas à des particuliers. Au contraire, une superficie importante appartenait à l'empereur. Les domaines impériaux, répartis en au moins trois ensembles, étaient gérés par un ou plusieurs  procurateur affranchi à qui il revenait de louer les terres et de les faire fructifier.[réf. nécessaire] La cité comptait environ 280 décurions qui devaient y posséder une superficie minimale, si l'on tient compte des propriétés des gens ordinaires et d'éventuelles possessions par des étrangers à la cité, on ne peut imaginer que le territoire était dominé par de nombreuses grandes propriétés : les habitants du territoire de Timgad n'étaient pas de gros exploitants[réf. nécessaire]. Toutefois, selon Pierre Morizot, des indices épigraphiques laissent à penser que quelques puissantes familles avaient réussi à accaparer les meilleures terres.\n\nLe bastion du donatisme\nAu IVe siècle, la cité se christianise. Si l'on a pu considérer que la réfection du capitole montre le maintien des traditions polythéistes et leur vivacité dans les années 360, la table de patronat d'Aelius Iulianus, ornée d'un chrisme montre clairement l'adhésion forte d'une partie au moins des notables les plus importants de la cité à la nouvelle religion. La même constatation peut être faite à partir des noms des clercs qui figurent à la fin de l'inscription de l'album municipal. La construction, à la périphérie de la cité, de bâtiments religieux chrétiens, dont certains très vastes comme la basilique de l'ouest et ses dépendances, témoigne aussi de l'implantation de la religion nouvelle. La christianisation se fit cependant d'abord dans le contexte troublé d'une division entre chrétiens : Timgad constitua une des places fortes du schisme donatiste qui bouleversa la religion chrétienne en Afrique au IVe siècle.[réf. nécessaire]\nSi dès son origine le donatisme était fortement lié à la Numidie, Timgad se distingua surtout lorsque l'Église schismatique dut affronter une opposition de plus en plus forte de la part des catholiques et du pouvoir impérial[réf. nécessaire]. Dès 388, Optatus, l'évêque donatiste de Timgad, rallie des circoncellions et s'appuie sur eux, ainsi que sur la complicité du comte d'Afrique Gildon pour imposer ses vues et pour contrer l'empereur Flavius Honorius en 397. Il est dix ans durant, selon Saint Augustin le gémissement de l'Afrique.\nCet évêque « chef de bande » est finalement arrêté à la mort de Gildon en 398 et finit sa vie en prison. Lors de la conférence de Carthage de 411 figure deux évêques rivaux de Timgad, le catholique Faustinanus et le donatiste Gaudentius. Mais, même après cette conférence, les donatistes de Timgad ne rendent pas les armes et vers 418 leur évêque Gaudentius s'enferme dans son église face au tribun Dulcitius, menace de s'immoler par le feu si on cherche à l'extraire de son église et polémique avec Augustin par courrier interposé.\n\nVandales\nL'installation d'un royaume vandale en Afrique, après 429, fut le point de départ d'une série d'affrontements qui déterminèrent la fin de Timgad. L'Aurès fut occupé sans doute assez rapidement par les Vandales, et il semble que Genséric ait voulu se réserver la région. L'occupation fut cependant de courte durée[réf. nécessaire]. La région de l'Aurès fut attaquée par les Maures qui prirent possession du massif au plus tard en 484 : Timgad fut prise et évacuée afin qu'aucun ennemi ne puisse s'y installer; la reconquête maure se fit aux dépens des habitants de la ville et des Libyens romanisés du massif. Il ne faut pas pour autant imaginer l'anéantissement radical de la ville et de toute activité : les murailles furent rasées et les habitants déportés selon Procope de Césarée, mais l'archéologie révèle que l'activité agricole se maintenait et que « dans la ville elle-même subsistait une vie précaire ».\nThéodose II s’est résigné à signer et Valentinien III a confirmé le nouveau traité de partage en 442 qui était avantageux pour les Vandales. Genséric reçoit une partie de la Numidie, dont Hippone. L’Empire romain se contente des régions pauvres de Numidie, dont Cirta. Le régime de terre était  contrôlé par le roi vandale, ce dernier accapare la terre des riches propriétaires africains romanisés et les charge d’impôts, ce que rapporte Procope, mais selon Victor de Vita, les riches étaient considérés libres. Ce qui est probable, selon Charles-André Julien. Les Berbères romanisés ont mené le même train de vie antérieur. Après la conférence de 484, Maximus et Cardelus, appartenant au clergé de la ville voisine Diana dans la wilaya de Aïn Beida, ont été  envoyés en exil par le roi Hunéric. Après la mort de Genséric, ses successeurs avaient des difficultés face aux tribus locales. L'économie et l’organisation sociale se trouvèrent en crise en Numidie lors du règne de Thrasamund, alors l’hérésie donatiste et la jacquerie en profitant des troubles durant le Ve siècle se soulèvent. Thrasamund riposte fortement, les montagnards de l’Aurès se précipitent sur la ville de Timgad et renversent le pouvoir en place, la population abandonne la ville de Timgad. Après la révolte, des royaumes berbères s'autoproclament, ce fut le cas de Masties qui s’est proclamé empereur entre les années 476 et 477. Une inscription trouvée aux environs d’Arris fait mention de lui, selon Jérôme Carcopino. Son règne dura une quarantaine d'années sur la région des Aurès.\n\nByzantins\nLa reconquête byzantine, à partir de 533, changea à nouveau la situation de la région. Les généraux de Justinien entreprirent la reconquête de l'Afrique, devant vaincre d'abord les Vandales puis les Maures révoltés, en particulier Iabdas, le chef des Maures de l'Aurès. C'est le patrice Solomon  qui est chargé de mener une campagne contre lui, campagne qui nous est en partie connue grâce à Procope[réf. nécessaire]. La région de Timgad, que Procope décrit comme une ville détruite, semble avoir été une base de cette campagne. Solomon pille les récoltes  de Timgad et de Lambèse avant de défaire Iabdas.\nCe n'est toutefois que lors de sa seconde campagne, en 539, que Solomon laissa des traces claires de sa présence puisqu'il fit construire le fort byzantin toujours visible sur le site. Ce puissant fort faisait partie d'une opération de fortification plus vaste visant à garantir la région contre une nouvelle attaque des Maures, Procope de Césarée nous apprend en effet qu'outre Timgad, quatre autres villes furent fortifiées dans la région. Le grand nombre d'inscriptions latines tirées du forum de la ville pour servir comme matériau de construction dans le fort montre cependant que Timgad avait passé l'époque de sa splendeur, et que seule la forteresse comptait désormais vraiment. C'est sous ses murs que s'était réorganisée une vie urbaine[réf. nécessaire]. Il faut faire la part dans le récit de Procope des exagérations et des lieux communs, le terroir autour de Timgad semble toujours mis en valeur à cette époque.\nNous ne possédons ensuite que fort peu de sources sur l'histoire de la région, et la fin de la présence byzantine est difficile à préciser[réf. nécessaire]. Il est certain qu'une vie urbaine se maintint dans la région, et la présence d'un christianisme organisé et dynamique est bien visible : dans la région de Batna, des reliques furent consacrées vers 581 et en 645 la dédicace d'une chapelle est attestée à Timgad. Le site ne semble pas avoir été immédiatement délaissé ensuite, mais l'histoire de son abandon complet ne peut actuellement pas être écrite faute de source historique ou archéologique. Au regard des problématiques et des pratiques historiques et archéologiques actuelles, on ne peut que regretter la perte d'information que les techniques de fouilles et les choix historiques des archéologues ont entraînée en négligeant cette période lors du dégagement de la ville : « Lorsque nous entrons aujourd'hui dans une maison, elle apparaît telle que l'architecte des Monuments historiques voulut qu'elle fût. C'est-à-dire vidée des couches tardives et des remaniements qui auraient pu témoigner d'un devenir, notons pour le présent cet effacement de toute une tranche du passé qui n'a pas été digne d'être conservée. Ce qui occulte la longue durée et réduit le passé à une image à laquelle on ne saurait se fier » et il est impossible de décrire ce qu'était Timgad lors de la conquête musulmane du Maghreb.[réf. nécessaire]\n\nLes institutions  et les notables de la cité\nTimgad est une colonie romaine avec ses institutions civiques reproduisant le système romain ; pendant sa fondation, la ville a dû recevoir une lex coloniae fixant ses institutions comme dans le cas de la lex Ursonensis. \nÀ l'intérieur de la curie, un album municipal contenant les noms des membres de la curie est trouvé par Émile Masqueray, il a été rapporté au Musée du Louvre, et un autre a été retrouvé par Edmond Duthoit, mais incomplet.\nL'album municipal de Timgad, établi durant la seconde moitié du IVe siècle, compte une liste de 263 personnes, dont 55 noms incomplets. Deux groupes d'élite apparaissent, les flamines perpétuels et les honorati, probablement, les deux forment la masse dirigeante de la ville.\nUn autre document dit l'ordo de salutation, il a été découvert en 1940 par Charles Goudet au fort byzantin à Timgad, il fut gravé en 282 probablement à la mémoire de l'empereur Carus, puis martelé après sa disparition. Il mesure  1 m et 29 cm de longueur et 39 cm de largeur et a une épaisseur de 28 cm.\nLors du règne de l’empereur Julien en 363, la liberté du culte est proclamée, les chrétiens rentraient dans la loi commune, ce que Leschi a indiqué à propos de l’ album de Timgad et ce qui a conduit après aux troubles en Numidie impliquant les chrétiens, les donatistes et les circoncellions.\n\nL'ordo (conseil des décurions)\nTimgad était appelée Respublica Thamugadensium et son conseil des décurions avait le nom de splendidissimus ordo. L'Ordre décurional de Timgad est un des mieux connus du monde romain en raison de la présence à Timgad d'un document exceptionnel, l'album municipal, qui fut établi par l'Empereur Julien. Cet album énumère les catégories des honorati, y figure en premier les clarissimi, ensuite les perfectissimi (deux uniquement) et les sacerdotales (deux seulement). Les autres catégories d'honorati ne sont pas représentées dans la ville de Timgad.\nLes noms ne diffèrent pas par rapport à la fonction ou à la confession, un religieux ou un païen peuvent avoir le même nom à Timgad au IVe siècle.\nLes honoratis ne siègent plus au sein de la curie ni dans les affaires de la ville; les décurions et les magistrats annuels sont les responsables des décisions et de l’exécution sur le plan local uniquement.\n\nLes magistratures\nLes magistrats annuels au Haut Empire et titulaires sont au nombre de sept, deux duumvirs, deux édiles, un curateur et deux questeurs.\nIl semble que les titres ainsi que le nombre de questeurs, d’édiles et de duumvirs sont restés les mêmes jusqu'à l'arrivée des Vandales. Leur nombre est faible par rapport aux autres titres, il avait probablement moins d’honneur que les flaminats perpétuels.\n\nLes duumvirs\nDeux duumvirs sont mentionnés sur l'Album, avec le statut de Magistrat annuel. Le nombre n’était pas important probablement à cause des lois qui interdisaient les dispenses des charges municipales aux egregii.\nP. Iulius Liberalis, natif de Timgad, faisant partie de la tribu des Papiria, officiant du culte Impérial, il a exercé la fonction de questeur et  de grand-prêtre dans la province Afrique puisqu'au temps de Sévère, la Numidie n’était plus rattachée à la province  d'Afrique. Il semble avoir eu un mandat de preafectuus jure dicumdo, a pu être deux fois duumvir ordinaire et ensuite, il a obtenu le poste de duumvir quinquennal. À la fin de sa carrière, il a reçu le titre de perpetuus flamine à Thysdrus et ensuite à Timgad, selon les inscriptions trouvées à Thamugadi. P. Iulius Liberalis a édifié une fontaine à Timgad.\n\nÉdiles, questeurs et curateur\nDeux édiles sont inscrits sur l'Album ayant le statut de Magistrat annuel.\nAprès la liste des magistrats annuels, il y a seulement deux édiles et deux questeurs, mais après la mention de la catégorie questeurs sur l'album, un seul est inscrit, Vitillius Saturninus. Les Pontifes et augures sont également des édiles, mais ils ont un rang moins important que les flamines.\nUn curateur  au Bas-Empire est nommé du nom Octavirus Sosinianus et en même temps, il est flamine et responsable de la rédaction de l’album.\n\nLes prêtrises\nPontificat et augurat\nL'album de Timgad montre qu'il y avait quatre pontifes et quatre augures dans la cité. Il est possible que ces prêtrises aient été annuelles, comme les autres charges.\n\nFlaminat\nLe flamine à Timgad était chargé du culte impérial. Il était assisté d'une flaminique qui n'était pas nécessairement sa femme. Son titre de flamine perpétuel était conservé à vie après un an d'exercice effectif de la fonction. Si l'accession à la charge « était relativement indépendante du cursus des magistratures municipales », il s'agissait de la plus haute dignité à Timgad et elle couronnait une grande notoriété et une forte honorabilité. Cela donnait aux titulaires de la charge une visibilité certaine, on en connaît donc un nombre important. Henriette Pavis d'Escurac en 1980 en a recensé 55, ainsi que 6 flaminiques. Le coût de la charge et l'honorabilité qu'elle procurait explique sans doute que l'on retrouve parmi les flamines de Timgad, de manière récurrente, les membres de quelques grandes familles de la cité, les Flavii et les Caelii, les Annii, les Plotii, les Pompeii. Cela explique aussi l'entrée d'un certain nombre de ces flamines dans l'ordre équestre (Pavis d'Escurac en recense sept), sans qu'ils n'aient fait toutefois de véritable carrière. L'ascension sociale vers les ordres supérieurs de l'empire pouvait prendre plusieurs générations, on sait ainsi que la fille d'un flamine, Arminia Paulina épousa un sénateur puis le procurateur Caius Annius Flavianus.\nSous le Haut-Empire, la somme honoraire du flaminat à Timgad était fixée à 10 000 sesterces, mais on attendait aussi de candidats des actes d'évergétisme en complément de cette somme, comme la distribution de nourriture, des dons de jeux scéniques, l'érection de statues pour les statues de Marc Aurèle et d'Antonin le Pieux par Marcus Caelius Saturninus ou les statues érigées au théâtre pour la famille de Caracalla par Pompeius Pudentianus ou la réalisation de constructions. Pour cette raison et parce qu'ils appartenaient au sommet de l'aristocratie de Timgad, les flamines ont laissé une empreinte notable dans l'urbanisme de Timgad : temple du Génie de la colonie, marché de Sertius, fontaine monumentale du flamine Julius Liberalis. Durant l'Antiquité tardive, la fonction a perdu de son caractère religieux pour devenir avant tout l'expression de la loyauté de la cité envers le pouvoir souverain, il y eut donc des flamines chrétiens comme le cas est attesté pour Aelius Iulianus.\nÀ Timgad, il y avait des femmes chargées du culte impérial. Manlia Pudentilla était  flaminique et clarissime et certaines flaminiques appartiennent à des familles de chevaliers comme Flavia Procilla. Cornelia Valentina Tucciana est flaminique et épouse d'un chevalier, elle a le titre honestae memoriae femina. Enfin Iulia Vic, elle l’est aussi.\n\nLes Augustales et l’ordo augustalium\nLes Augustales participaient à l'organisation du culte impérial dans la cité. Ils étaient souvent de riches affranchis et le statut d'Augustale leur donnait une dignité venant après celle des décurions. On ne connaît nominalement à Timgad qu'un Augustale, Valerius Carpus. Les Augustales étaient organisés en un ordo augustalium qui fonctionnait comme un collège et possédait une caisse (arca augustalium)[réf. nécessaire]. Les Augustales de Timgad ont ainsi financé la restauration du temple de Cérès.\n\nLes curies\nLes curies, qu'il ne faut pas confondre avec la curie, local accueillant le conseil des décurions, étaient des assemblées de citoyens de la cité qui avaient au départ un rôle électoral de section de vote sur le modèle des comices romains. Particulièrement bien connues en Afrique, elles eurent aussi un important rôle dans la sociabilité civique comme le montre le cas de la curie de Jupiter à Simitthus. Si bien qu'on a pu parfois les considérer comme « des « clubs de plébéiens » assez fermés », même si cela n'empêche pas qu'elles ont pu conserver un rôle politique. L'analyse de la liste des 52 membres de la curia Commodiana connus à Timgad vers 211 montre en effet une population appartenant plutôt aux couches moyennes et élevées de la société de Timgad. La curia Commodiana avait été créée pour honorer l'empereur Commode. On connaît aussi à Timgad une curia Marcia qui doit remonter aux origines de la colonie.\n\nLes collèges\nSans être à proprement parler des institutions officielles de la cité, les collèges participaient à la vie civique. Ils se plaçaient sous le patronage de grands personnages locaux et participaient aux fêtes de la cité. On connaît à Timgad le collège des Dendrophore.\n\nLes patrons de la cité\nLe légat D. Fonteius Frontinianus, qui était en poste à Lambèse de 160 à 162, a été coopté patron de Timgad ; l'album municipal de Timgad  mentionne  l’existence de six patrons, cinq d'entre eux de rang sénatorial, durant la première moitié de l’année 363. Le nombre des patrons s’expliquait possiblement du fait du choix des différents clans à l'intérieur de la curie et les clans pouvaient trouver un appui pour renforcer leur position locale.\n\nLe site et ses monuments\nLe forum\nLe forum et le théâtre de Timgad sont situés au cœur du quadrilatère de la ville originale, où ils occupent plusieurs des îlots définis par la trame des rues orthogonales. La construction du forum fut financée par la cité. Sa construction commença sans doute peu de temps après la fondation de la ville. Le forum, de plan rectangulaire et bordé par quatre portiques délimitait un espace fermé, ordonné, accueillant de nombreuses activités, il formait le cœur politique et social de la cité. Il abritait la curie où se rassemblait l'ordre décurional ainsi qu'une basilique civile et un seul temple. Ce dernier, de taille assez modeste, est proche d'un des angles du forum et semble avoir été dédié à la Victoire. C'est un édifice tétrastyle, c'est-à-dire que la façade compte quatre colonnes, élevées sur un podium[réf. nécessaire]. Édifiée en 116-117, la curie est en forme rectangulaire avec trois baies, le fond est occupé par une estrade comprenant des sièges mobiles, sa salle était précédée d'un portique, revêtue de marbre et ornée de quatre statues dont une dédiée à la Concorde de l'ordo et une dédiée à la Victoire. Élevée un peu plus tard, la basilique lui faisait face, occupant la façade orientale du forum. Une abside au nord donnait une axialité à cette vaste salle qui accueillait les activités judiciaires, une tribune occupait l'un des petits côtés et permettait aux juges de siéger. Le forum était décoré de nombreuses statues, au moins une trentaine, dont on a retrouvé les bases portant des inscriptions.[réf. nécessaire] Ce forum ne fut peut-être jamais achevé selon son plan original, puisque le Capitole ne fut pas intégré au forum, mais construit à l'extérieur des murailles originales : l'expansion de la ville avait conduit à reconsidérer son plan\n\nLe théâtre\nLe théâtre est le principal édifice de spectacle à Timgad où l'on n'a pas retrouvé trace d'un amphithéâtre, mais il a pu en exister un en bois à titre temporaire. Situé au sud du forum, au flanc d'une colline, le théâtre, avec une cavea de 63 mètres de diamètre, pouvait accueillir environ 3 500 personnes. La base d'une statue de Mercure, élevée pour le salut des empereurs Septime Sévère et Caracalla y célébrait les jeux scéniques donnés par Lucius Germeus Silvanus, pour l'honneur de ses fonctions d'augure : à Timgad comme ailleurs la vie municipale n'était pas séparable des fêtes et spectacles, avec plus ou moins de fastes en fonction de l'évergétisme des notables.[réf. nécessaire]\nPlusieurs fissures au sein du théâtre antique sont visibles. Un nouveau théâtre a été construit pour accueillir le Festival international de musique de Timgad, entre le temple de Saturne et les grands thermes du nord et à l’extérieur de la frontière du site antique.\n\nLe temple de Cérès\nLe temple de Cérès se trouvait à proximité du théâtre. Entre 139 et 161, sa restauration intégrale a été financée par l'ordo augustalium, composé des flamines, dont Valerius Carpus qui était influent  et faisait partie des flamines responsable de l'organisation du culte impérial à Timgad et P. Actius Silvanus adepte du culte Cérès. L'argent de la restauration du temple venait de la caisse du collège; les adeptes du temple, les Augustales ne dépendaient pas de la caisse publique municipale.\n\nLa bibliothèque\nLes fouilles de Timgad ont révélé un bâtiment relativement inhabituel qui n’a été identifié comme une bibliothèque publique qu’en 1906 grâce à la découverte d’une inscription latine. Le texte de l’inscription précise qu'au IIIe siècle sans doute, mais Paul Corbier considère que la datation est inconnue. Le sénateur Marcus Iulius Quintianus Flavius Rogatianus avait légué par testament 400 000 sesterces à la cité pour la construction d’une bibliothèque. La cité fit construire la bibliothèque et honora le généreux donateur d’une statue honorifique.[réf. nécessaire]\nLa bibliothèque était organisée autour d'un portique à trois côtés ouvrant largement sur la rue. Face à la rue, au fond du portique, une grande salle semi-circulaire en abside était aménagée avec des niches destinées à accueillir les ouvrages[réf. nécessaire]. De part et d'autre six salles annexes donnaient sur le portique. On a tenté d’estimer le nombre de volumes qu’elle pouvait accueillir : ainsi on a pu estimer que sa salle principale pouvait accueillir seize armaria (armoire de bibliothèque) et donc peut-être 6 800 volumes ; avec les six pièces secondaires, le total des ouvrages est estimé entre 16 000 et 28 000[réf. nécessaire]. Ces chiffres sont toutefois très contestables, car la bibliothèque pouvait aussi accueillir des archives et que les calculs sur lesquels ils reposent sont très spéculatifs. Elle est située au cœur de la ville, signe de l’importance qu’elle avait dans la culture urbaine.[réf. nécessaire]\n\nLe temple du Génie de la colonie\nLa dédicace de ce temple a été retrouvée lors des fouilles de 1959, en réemploi dans une petite placette aménagée à l'époque byzantine autour d'une fontaine\n. Le temple a été payé par des membres d'une des grandes familles de Timgad, Marcus Publicius Candidus et son frère Caius Publicius Veranus. Ce don est la conséquence de l'accession de Candidus à la charge de flamine perpétuel, la plus haute dignité à Timgad. Outre la somme honoraire de 10 000 sesterces payés par Candidus, son frère a ajouté une pollicitation de 20 000 sesterces. Finalement le coût du temple fut, avec sa statue, de 64 500 sesterces[réf. nécessaire]. Cet acte d'évergétisme et cette dépense attestent de la prospérité de Timgad lors de la construction du temple. La dédicace fut faite par un légat de la IIIe légion Auguste. Son nom fut ensuite martelé, en raison d'une damnatio memoriae. Il s'agissait vraisemblablement de Marcus Lucceius Torquatus, ce qui date la dédicace du temple de 169.\nLes ruines du temple ont pu être identifiées grâce à d'autres inscriptions. Il est situé à la sortie occidentale de la ville, face au marché de Sertius. Une cour précédait le sanctuaire en donnant sur le decumanus par une façade à trois entrée. Un mur délimitait cet espace de forme trapézoïdale d'une dimension de 32 m sur 12 m[réf. nécessaire]. Trois des côtés étaient occupés par un portique comptant 17 colonnes. Derrière l'autel se trouvait le temple proprement dit. Sa cella de 12,5 m par 7,5 m. s'ouvrait sur un fronton tétrastyle d'ordre corinthien et était précédée d'un escalier à 16 marches. La construction du temple correspond aussi à un moment d'extension de Timgad hors de l'enceinte initiale de la colonie.\n\nLe Capitole\nLe capitole, qui abritait la triade religieuse essentielle de la religion romaine traditionnelle, était en théorie un des éléments essentiels de toute fondation urbaine. Au Ier siècle av. J.-C. les écrits de Vitruve sur l’urbanisme, se référant à une vieille tradition, celle de la science des haruspices, et faisant ainsi un écho à Servius, conseillent de placer les sanctuaires de Jupiter, Junon et Minerve au lieu le plus élevé, d’où l’on peut découvrir le plus de murailles. Mais si des villes africaines comme Cuicul et Thugga présentent un capitole en position centrale (au moins initialement pour Cuicul), celui de Timgad est dans une position plus surprenante. Il est en effet éloigné du forum et même de l’alignement du plan orthonormé initial et ne se trouve même pas sur un sommet de colline. En fait c’est surtout sa taille, sa monumentalité exceptionnelle qui le distinguait et le rendait visible à tous. Cet emplacement étrange avait cependant le mérite de le mettre particulièrement en valeur pour qui venait de Lambèse. Construit au IIe siècle, il fut restauré au IVe.[réf. nécessaire]\nComment expliquer cette position excentrée ? Il faut penser qu’il était prévu en fait au départ au sein du forum dans le tracé initial de la ville, mais le forum ne fut jamais réellement achevé, et le capitole finalement construit en bien plus grand et en position décentrée, signe d’une modification radicale de la notion d’espace urbain et peut-être d’un changement dans les relations entre les citoyens et le pouvoir : la ville avait grandi, son espace était perçu différemment et fut symboliquement réorganisé par cette construction massive.\nDe plus, le décentrement du capitole de Timgad n’est pas si exceptionnel du point de vue chronologique : la majorité des capitoles africains sont de date relativement tardive.[réf. nécessaire] Enfin, si la date exacte de sa construction autour du IIe siècle nous échappe (peut-être l'époque sévérienne, sa réfection au IVe siècle nous est mieux connue. C'est sous le règne commun de Valentinien Ier et Valens, entre 364 et 367 qu'Aelius Iulianus finança la restauration des portiques. Selon Paul-Albert Février, cette restauration pourrait témoigner, cinquante ans après la conversion de Constantin, et dans une ville bien christianisée, de la vitalité conservée du polythéisme traditionnel. Toutefois Claude Lepelley a récusé cette interprétation, le responsable de l'opération, Aelius Iulianus était curateur de la cité et chrétien et la restauration concernait la place à portique et non l'édifice cultuel proprement dit. Par sa monumentalité et sa superficie - supérieur à celle du forum - la place à portique du Capitole constituait un « second forum » dans la ville. Ses portiques étaient donc vus, à l'époque d'Aelius « comme des monuments publics appartenant au patrimoine monumental de la cité, sans référence à la fonction religieuse de ces édifices ».\n\nL'Arc de triomphe\nLa large avenue qui passe devant le capitole aboutit au nord à l'arc de triomphe érigé à l'entrée ouest du decumanus maximus. Peu avant la fin du IIe siècle, la porte utilitaire fut remplacée par un arc de triomphe appelé abusivement « arc de Trajan » qui, avec un minimum de restauration, nous est parvenu presque intact.\nLa large baie centrale de six mètres de haut permettait le passage des véhicules qui ont laissé de profondes ornières sur les dalles de la voie. Aux piétons étaient réservées les deux baies latérales, de trois mètres soixante-quinze de haut. Au-dessus de ces dernières, sur les deux faces maitresses, sont creusées des niches rectangulaires ornées de colonnettes destinées à recevoir des statues, dominées par des voûtes en arceau assises sur des colonnes corinthiennes détachées. Quatre colonnes montées sur piédestal pour chaque face principale. L'ensemble était couronné au faîte de l'édifice d'un groupe comprenant sans doute un char.[réf. nécessaire]\nD'autres reliefs furent ajoutés par la suite à la base de la face est: les statues de Mars et de la déesse de la Concorde, érigées sous le règne de Septime Sévère (193-211) par un certain L. Licinius Optatianus en reconnaissance de son élection au flaminat perpétuel de la colonie.\n\nPlotius Faustus Sertius\nPlotius Faustus Sertius était un riche personnage de rang équestre.\nSa famille était liée à un chevalier romain, fils de vétéran, ainsi qu'à la famille des Flavii qui entrèrent au sénat. Il fut flamine perpétuel de la cité. Sa richesse, ainsi que celle de sa femme, provenait des terres qu’il possédait sur le territoire de la colonie, mais aussi d’autres revenus comme la location de boutiques.\nDivers indices épigraphiques et archéologiques permettent de cerner les biens fonciers de Sertius et de sa femme : une dédicace fait en effet allusion à cette dernière sur une inscription trouvée dans la vallée de l’oued Taga.\nDe même, à une soixantaine de kilomètres de Timgad, dans le massif de l’Aurès, on a retrouvé une mosaïque portant les mêmes motifs que ceux de la maison de Sertius, indice d’une de ses propriétés et de l’influence du personnage.\n\nMarché de Sertius\nPlotius et sa femme financèrent à l’époque des Sévères la construction d’un marché situé à l’ouest de la ville originelle, non loin de sa maison. La ville possédait sans doute déjà un marché, appelé aujourd'hui marché de l’est il se trouvait près du forum et s’étendait sur deux cours semi-circulaires. Sans doute s’était-il avéré insuffisant avec la croissance de la ville. Le marché payé par Sertius fait face au temple du Génie de la colonie, c’est une place oblongue, bordée de portiques, disposant des aménagements nécessaires pour accueillir les étals des marchands, et se terminant par une abside.[réf. nécessaire] Le marché possédait une ouverture qui donnait sur des thermes. Ceux-ci sont souvent considérés comme une annexe du marché, mais leur construction n’est pas nécessairement liée à la même opération immobilière et leur rapport avec les constructions voisines n'est pas claire. Par la suite, un autre petit marché, sans doute destiné au commerce de vêtement, fut construit dans le quartier. Construire un marché était un acte d’évergétisme important, mais ce don fait à la cité était sans doute aussi un « cadeau intéressé » : contemporain de la construction de sa maison, il en constitue sans doute la contrepartie : l’acte d’évergétisme répondant à l’appropriation privée d’une partie importante du sol public : derrière le don de Sertius se cache une fructueuse opération immobilière tandis que son marché proclamait sa générosité et sa libéralité envers sa cité.[réf. nécessaire]\nLe quartier ouest de Timgad illustre donc bien, à travers le dossier de Sertius, l’impact de la richesse des notables municipaux sur la ville tant par l’évergétisme qu’à travers des investissements plus intéressés – boutiques – ou destinés à leur procurer un cadre de vie dont le faste correspondait à leur dignitas.[réf. nécessaire]\n\nLe quartier de Sertius\nAvec le développement de la ville et son extension à l’ouest, la muraille originelle s’est retrouvée en position centrale dans cette partie de l’agglomération, elle est devenue inutile dans un espace disponible, intéressant et sans doute convoité. La disparition de la muraille au profit du bâti se fit cependant au bénéfice d’habitants fortunés et donna lieu à d’importantes « opérations immobilières » ainsi que l'a montré Jean Lassus.Le nouveau quartier n’est pas en effet occupé en continuité avec la trame originelle de la ville : les rues existantes ne sont pas prolongées sur l’espace libéré, celui-ci au contraire est occupé par les constructions de très riches personnages qui s’approprient ainsi une bande de terrain large de 22 mètres[réf. nécessaire]. L’extension de la ville s’accompagne donc d’une « différenciation sociale des quartiers » :l’espace pris sur la muraille permet de s’affranchir des contraintes des îlots du plan initial, d’une taille de 400 mètres carrés environ. Ce réaménagement ne put se faire sans un ensemble de mesures légales : le lieu appartenait au sol public de la cité, son aliénation exigeait au moins un décret de l’ordre des décurions, et dans le cas d’une muraille[réf. nécessaire], res sacra, une décision impériale.\nIl est vrai cependant que l’usurpation de terrains publics par des constructions privées n’était pas rare dans les cités antiques et que le pouvoir romain a dû à plusieurs reprises intervenir contre de tels cas : derrière les maisons construites à cet endroit, il faut donc imaginer un ensemble de démarches, et sans doute de pots-de-vin. La documentation épigraphique disponible nous permet de connaître un peu plus précisément ce contexte immobilier à travers la personne de Marcus Plautius Faustus, dit Sertius qui se fit construire une maison sur l’emplacement de la muraille.[réf. nécessaire]\n\nMaison de Marcus Plotius Faustus Sertius\nLa maison de Sertius fut construite sur le tracé de la muraille. De plan rectangulaire, mesurant 62 mètres sur 36,5 mètres, elle occupe une surface de 2 263 m2, c’est une des demeures les plus luxueuses de Timgad. Son accès principal, précédé d’un petit portique, et qui comptait peut-être à l’origine une entrée tripartite, donne sur le cardo maximus. Le plan présente la succession classique d’un vestibule et de péristyles qui donnent sur des pièces de réception. Le vestibule, dallé, possédait une colonnade centrale, il donnait sur un premier péristyle qui ouvrait lui-même sur une vaste pièce, sans doute une salle à manger (triclinium)[réf. nécessaire]. Le second péristyle abrite un bassin aux aménagements complexes : deux réservoirs superposés sont reliés par deux ouvertures. Des vases fixés horizontalement y étaient destinés à fournir un abri à des poissons et vraisemblablement à les recueillir frais : il s’agit donc d’un vivier.[réf. nécessaire] Une salle avec une antichambre à deux colonnes donnait sur le péristyle, il s’agit sans doute à nouveau d’un triclinium, une salle à manger. Les bassins avaient une fonction à la fois esthétique et économique : les poissons élevés pouvaient être utilisés pour les repas du maître. Produits rares, luxueux, ils attestaient de l’aisance de Sertius et permettaient de montrer son faste à ses invités[réf. nécessaire]. Le second péristyle est toutefois un espace sans doute plus intime que le premier : « d’un côté accueil, réception, ostentation, de l’autre vie plus retirée ».\nLa maison de Faustus possédait aussi des thermes privés. Ceux-ci se trouvaient près de son entrée – ils ouvraient sur le premier péristyle - et avaient aussi leur propre accès sur la rue. Les accès des thermes montrent que Sertius pouvait les ouvrir à des personnes extérieures à sa maison, amis, clients, voisins. Les thermes possédaient un frigidarium de 35 mètres carrés et un ensemble balnéaire d’environ 150 mètres carrés comptant quatre salles chauffées. On y avait placé les statues en marbre d’Esculape et d’Hygie, divinités de la santé couramment associées aux bains.[réf. nécessaire] Une inscription figurant sur la base d’une des statues et nommant un Faustus et une Valentina permet à la fois l’attribution de la maison à Marcus Plotius Faustus Sertius et à sa femme Cornelia Valentina Tucciana Sertia et sa datation. Construites sous les Sévères la maison de Sertius illustre un moment clé dans l’évolution du plan de Timgad ainsi qu’ « un des tout premiers exemples datés de bains privés urbains d’époque impériale ». Des boutiques étaient adossées à la maison.[réf. nécessaire]\n\nLe temple de la Dea Patria et l'Aqua septimiana felix\nL'Aqua Septimiana Felix était une source à proximité de Timgad qui alimentait en eau une piscine autour de laquelle fut construit un important sanctuaire. Le sanctuaire a été construit au IIe siècle à 300 mètres au sud de la ville, le long d'un axe nord-sud. Une allée à colonnades reliait le sanctuaire à la ville et notamment aux thermes du sud.[réf. nécessaire] Avec plus de 150 mètres de long et 44 mètres de large, c'est le plus grand édifice religieux de l'Afrique romaine.\nIl reçut un aménagement somptueux sous les Sévères. Trois temples étaient construits au fond du sanctuaire. Le plus grand de ces lieux de culte occupait la place médiane et était dédié à la Dea Patria, c'est-à-dire à la déesse de l'Afrique reconnaissable à sa coiffe faite d'une dépouille d'éléphant (proboscis). Décoré de marbres blancs et verts, de mosaïques, le temple faisait 7,5 mètres sur 9,8. Une large banquette au fond de la cella devait accueillir les statues de culte[réf. nécessaire].\nDe part et d’autre se trouvait un temple plus petit (5,1 par 7,1 mètres). Celui de l'ouest était dédié à Esculape tandis que celui de l'est a sans doute été dédié à Sarapis, si l'on en croit les objets de culte retrouvés lors des fouilles. L'association de l'Afrique à Esculape et Sarapis est unique, placée sous le signe de la fertilité, de l'abondance et de la santé, le sanctuaire célébrait les eaux bienfaisantes en association avec le culte impérial. Les trois temples, assez petits, étaient érigés sur une terrasse qui surplombait une vaste piscine de 27 mètres sur 7. Entièrement revêtue de marbre, elle était bordée d'une balustrade en bronze. Le sanctuaire était entouré de portiques peints (viridarium). Leur prolongement donnait sur une vaste place dallée en direction de la ville et de ses thermes.[réf. nécessaire]\nQuatre inscriptions identiques datent ces aménagements somptueux de 213. Elles illustrent les dons que les notables de Timgad consacrèrent au sanctuaire, sans doute dès le début de sa construction. Des inscriptions découvertes dans le sanctuaire, mais dont la publication est encore incomplète, témoignent des dons de Publius Flavius Pudens Pomponianus, sénateur romain originaire de Timgad, et de sa famille. Sa mère notamment y consacra, avec d'autres habitants de Timgad, une défense d'éléphant au Genius patriae (Génie de la patrie). Cette implication des puissants notables de la ville dans le sanctuaire montre son rôle important : il contribuait sans doute en partie à définir l'identité de Timgad, comme le montrent les dédicaces au Génie de la Patrie ou à la déesse de la Patrie, mais aussi l'inscription du forum qui célèbre Flavius Pudens Pomponianus et qui compare son éloquence à une source et rappelle que Timgad est située vers une source : il s'agit d'une allusion à l'Aqua Septimiana où Flavius et sa famille s'étaient illustrés par de nombreux dons, le rapprochement a été fait par L. Leschi. La déesse Africa du sanctuaire était aussi célébrée sur des céramiques produites à Timgad.\nSi le sanctuaire connu son apogée à l'époque des Sévères, peut-être en relation avec le voyage africain de Septime Sévère, on peut penser que le culte de la source remontait à l'époque préromaine et témoigne d'une survivance de la religiosité locale au sein de la vie de la colonie romaine, « il s'agit évidemment d'une source miraculeuse ancienne, dont les Romains ont capté les pouvoirs, en installant autour d'elle un temple comportant des statues des divinités romaines guérisseuses. ». À la fin de l'antiquité, le sanctuaire fut recouvert par la forteresse byzantine.[réf. nécessaire] Découvert et dégagé lors des fouilles de cette forteresse, le sanctuaire de l'Aqua Septimiana Felix n'a pas été l'objet d'une publication particulière et nombre de découvertes qui y ont été faites sont encore inédites.\n\nLes thermes\nLes thermes romains étaient un des lieux essentiels de la vie quotidienne dans l'Empire romain, un symbole et un facteur de romanisation. Pour les habitants d'une cité, les thermes sont vus comme quelque chose d'indispensable, une des commodités nécessaires que la ville doit procurer à ses habitants, un signe et un instrument de civilisation et de bien-être. À Timgad, sur une dalle du forum, une inscription célèbre résume bien cette conception de la vie urbaine : « Venari, lavari, ludere, ridere, occ est vivere » (chasser, aller au bain, jouer, rire, ça, c’est vivre). Les thermes sont donc un lieu de sociabilité fondamental qui construit l'identité civique et municipale en même temps qu'ils rendent manifeste les principes de la cité antique : nus et partageant le même bain, les citoyens se côtoient de manière indifférenciée : les bains sont souvent peu chers, et occasionnellement gratuits. Leur décoration et leur entretien sont aussi l'occasion d'acte d'évergétisme. Toutefois à partir du IIe siècle, on assiste au développement de bains privés, construits dans les plus riches demeures, développement qui s'accroit durant l'Antiquité tardive. On peut voir dans cette évolution à la fois le souci d'une plus grande intimité et la recherche d'une distance sociale : le notable se distingue désormais du commun et peu recevoir ses intimes dans le cadre choisi de ses bains personnels. Par le vaste dégagement dont elle a fait l'objet, Timgad offre une image quasiment unique de la place des bains dans la cité, même si tous les bains dégagés n'ont pas nécessairement été en service de manière simultanée et si leurs fouilles ont été souvent - au regard des critères actuels - trop rapidement conduites : les stratigraphies manquent, les plans ne sont pas toujours sûrs. Il n'en reste pas moins que l'importance et la diversité de l'équipement balnéaire ressortent et que, de ce point de vue, Timgad peut rivaliser avec une ville comme Ostie. Les bains de Timgad offrent donc une image remarquable de la prospérité de l'Afrique romaine et de son insertion dans la communauté culturelle que formait la Méditerranée antique.[réf. nécessaire]\nLes thermes de Timgad ont fourni un nombre important de mosaïques : 85 sur les 235 de l'inventaire fait par Suzanne Germain Warot en 1969. Sur les quatorze thermes recensés dans son étude, douze avaient conservé au moins en partie leur pavement.[réf. nécessaire] Le décor y est essentiellement géométrique agrémenté parfois de tableaux comme la représentation de Neptune pour les grands thermes est ou la représentation de Jupiter pour les thermes des Philadelphes[réf. nécessaire]. Les salles annexes de ces thermes pouvaient aussi avoir des décors non négligeables.\n\nL'habitat individuel\nMalgré l'ampleur des dégagements, l'habitat individuel n'est pas à Timgad aussi bien connu qu'on pourrait l'espérer :les fouilles initiales ont été peu soucieuses de protéger les divers états du bâti, d'observer la stratigraphie. Néanmoins des distinctions peuvent être faites. On peut ainsi opposer le quartier de la ville initiale et les faubourgs. Dans le premier l'habitat est resté très fortement contraint par le découpage des parcelles effectué lors de la fondation de la colonie, ces 132 îlots de 400 m2 ont en effet rarement été l'objet de regroupement[réf. nécessaire]. Les plus grandes de ces maisons, qui occupent un îlot, exceptionnellement deux comme pour la maison s'étendant sur les insulae 73 et 82, n'ont qu'une cour à portique et rarement un vrai péristyle, on trouve couramment 2 à 4 maisons par îlot. Malgré cette contrainte foncière, l'aristocratie de la cité n'abandonna pas complètement le centre-ville, une inscription laissée par le flamine perpétuel Corfidius nous apprend qu'il avait acheté une maison « rendue triste depuis longtemps déjà par son état de ruines informes » et l'avait rebâtie « plus heureusement qu'elle n'avait été fondée  pour lui-même et la joyeuse postérité des Corfidii ». De même L. Iulius Ianuarius possédait une maison occupant tout un îlot et équipée de bains privés.\n\nDemeures de l'aristocratie\nToutefois les plus grandes demeures de l'aristocratie de Timgad ne se trouvent qu'en dehors du périmètre originel, sur l'ancienne limite même pour la maison de Sertius et la maison dite de l'Hermaphrodite, toutes deux de près de 2 200 mètres carrés, superficie considérable et pourtant dépassée par une grande demeure du quartier nord, voisine des thermes de Philadelphes, aux limites de la plus grande extension de la ville et occupant 2 500 mètres carrés. Ces superficies ne renvoient toutefois pas nécessairement à l'espace habité : les grandes demeures intégraient des boutiques qui pouvaient être louées, des espaces de service, autant de surface qui n'était pas occupée par l'habitat du maître, celui-ci toutefois pouvait se développer à l'étage, mais nous en ignorons alors tout.\nCorfidius Crementius, prêtre de haut rang et adepte du culte impérial, était le propriétaire de la maison des jardins. Les sols de sa maison sont dépourvus de mosaïque, mais dallés. Sa demeure est située au cœur de la cité. À l'angle ouest de sa maison et en annexe à son vestibule, un édicule à usage de latrines dont constate l'empiétement sur le petit cardo que desservait sa maison, très symétrique et axiale, à laquelle les bacs aux contours sinueux ornent la cour centrale et ont donné son nom la maison des jardins. À proximité de l’Arc de Trajan (Timgad), la maison de la Piscina, on entre par la voie cardinale, on accède au salon qui comprend des mosaïques florales avec des motifs en forme de cœur d'acanthes roses. La maison de Pompéien dont le propriétaire, était Plotius Sertius, ce dernier avait offert un beau marché à ses concitoyens. Il a choisi le côté sud-est de la ville pour construire une maison de 2 600 m◊, le vestibule est dallé contenant quatre piliers et avec accès aux bains.\n\nDécoration\nLa décoration interne peut aussi aider à distinguer différents quartiers. Ainsi l'étude des mosaïques a révélé que toutes les maisons de la partie du decumanus entre le forum et la porte de Mascula étaient décorées, zone qui contraste avec l'ouest du decumanus, bien moins décoré. Les faubourgs présentent aussi quelques grandes maisons richement décorées, en particulier entre le Capitole et l'avenue de Lambèse[réf. nécessaire]. Ainsi se dessineraient des quartiers résidentiels aisés : le cardo nord, le decumanus est, la porte sud, le faubourg ouest, le quartier nord-est en revanche où les ruines n'ont pas livrées de mosaïques devait être plus modeste. Ce quartier nord-est regroupait dix-sept des vingt-deux établissements de Timgad ayant une activité textile, pour une production qui n'était probablement pas destinée uniquement à la cité.\n\nSociété urbaine\nIl serait néanmoins impropre de penser que l'échelle sociale était uniquement reproduite dans la trame des quartiers : les riches maisons de l'aristocratie abritaient les esclaves du maître, et leurs boutiques étaient louées à des gens modestes, parfois pauvres[réf. nécessaire]. Il n'en reste pas moins qu'à Timgad l'essor de la ville s'est accompagné « d'une différenciation sociale des quartiers ». La demeure est un enjeu fondamental pour les aristocraties des cités, à Timgad, comme dans la plupart des cités de l'empire au IIe siècle, l'atrium a été remplacé par un péristyle. On y accède par un vestibule et il donne sur des espaces de réception : triclinium, oecus.[réf. nécessaire] Le faste du propriétaire peut s'exprimer en fonction de ses moyens et de l'espace disponible : les deux péristyles de la maison de Sertius, l'antichambre à colonnes du second, leurs ornements par des viviers renvoient aux pratiques de la grande aristocratie romaine. Les mosaïques, les fresques, l'ameublement participent aussi de la construction d'un cadre propre à montrer la puissance du propriétaire et à fonder, comme on l'a vu avec la demeure de Corfidius, un ancrage dynastique au sein des notables de la cité.[réf. nécessaire] On a noté, au demeurant, un souci des propriétaires de conserver les décors, au moins pour ce qui est des mosaïques. Les thermes privés, ceux de la maison de Sertius sont parmi les plus anciens, permettent aussi de recevoir clients et amis, ou peuvent être ouverts moyennant une somme modique aux habitants du quartier, mais ils permettent aussi au maître de maison de prendre son bain dans un cadre intime, dispositif reflétant « le besoin aristocratique de se tenir à l'écart de la foule et une nouvelle façon d'appréhender son corps caractérisée par l'affirmation de la pudeur ».\n\nLes bâtiments chrétiens\nComme dans la plupart des villes antiques d’Afrique, les bâtiments chrétiens se trouvent surtout à la périphérie de l'agglomération en raison de leur caractère tardif, mais aussi parfois de leur association avec des nécropoles. Un seul bâtiment chrétien a été identifié dans le centre-ville, il s’agit d’une chapelle aménagée à partir de l’atrium de la maison de Lucius Julius Januarius, non loin du forum.[réf. nécessaire]\nLe plus grand ensemble chrétien se trouve autour de la basilique de l’ouest, séparé de la ville par un ravin. Cet édifice et ses dépendances sont souvent assimilés au quartier donatiste en raison de la présence, dans une des maisons du complexe religieux, sur une mosaïque commémorative, du nom d’Optat, identifié à l’évêque Optat.\nLa basilique présente un plan classique à trois nefs avec des dimensions considérables : 23 mètres de large sur 63 de long. La nef centrale se termine en abside et est précédée par un atrium. Ce dernier était décoré de colonnes à chapiteaux corinthiens, peut-être en réemplois. Au nord-ouest se trouvait un baptistère dont la cuve a été retrouvée en bon état, encore partiellement couvert de mosaïques polychromes aux motifs géométriques sur les marches, aux motifs floraux autour de la cuve.[réf. nécessaire] Au moins un ensemble thermal existait aussi dans ces bâtiments[réf. nécessaire]. Un sarcophage retrouvé dans la basilique témoigne d'aménagements permettant la réalisation de libations alimentaires, présentant ainsi une continuité remarquable avec les rites funéraires polythéistes, survivance qui pourrait s'expliquer, selon Henri-Irénée Marrou par le donatisme des fidèles de la basilique. Une chapelle annexe, longue de 26 mètres, est accolée au flanc gauche de la basilique.\nLe fait que d’autres bâtiments basilicaux aussi importants aient aussi des baptistères témoigne sans doute de la division religieuse de la cité entre donatistes et catholique : le baptistère renvoie en effet d’ordinaire à la présence de l’évêque. Selon Courtois l’édifice catholique correspondait à l’église de la route de Lambèse. En fait, en l’absence d’inscription, il est impossible de distinguer un bâtiment donatiste d’un bâtiment catholique et les attributions des trois grandes basiliques de Timgad, du centre, du nord-ouest et de l’ouest restent incertaines.\nLa ville présente d’autres édifices chrétiens plus modestes, mais difficiles à dater entre le Ve siècle et le VIIe. Une grande partie de ces édifices fut élevée avec des matériaux de réemplois et de récupération : c’est le cas notamment d’une chapelle très ruinée retrouvée près du Capitole. La nécropole sud de la ville, où furent retrouvées près de 10 000 tombes, malheureusement la plupart très modestes et anonymes, était dominée par deux églises, l’une d’elles ayant été élevée entre 641 et 642 par Jean, duc de Tigisi. Le fort byzantin possédait aussi, bien sûr, sa propre chapelle.[réf. nécessaire]\n\nLes nécropoles\nComme toute ville romaine, Timgad était entourée de ses nécropoles : les sépultures ne pouvaient prendre place qu'en dehors de l'enceinte urbaine. La tombe du mime Vincentius rappelle précisément cette règle à Timgad :« « Vincentius est là, honneur des pantomimes , etc. il vit à tout jamais dans la bouche du peuple , etc.. Ici maintenant sous terre, il demeure devant les remparts. Vingt-trois ans, il a vécu sa fleur » ». Leur exploration ne fut cependant que tardive et incomplète : ce n'est qu'à partir de 1932 que les archéologues commencèrent vraiment à les dégager, après le dégagement du quadrilatère de la ville trajanienne. Aujourd'hui encore, les nécropoles sont donc très incomplètement connues, et si certaines ont souffert de l'érosion, il est possible de penser que des découvertes intéressantes restent à faire[réf. nécessaire]. En l'état actuel des connaissances l'une des nécropoles les mieux connues reste celle de la porte de Lambèse qui fut fouillée à partir de 1932 et donna lieu à une publication succincte.\nLa nécropole en question se trouve à 150 mètres de la porte de Lambèse, et à environ 500 mètres de l'arc dit de Trajan. Son dégagement a révélé une grande diversité de tombes que les fouilleurs ont regroupées en cinq grands types.\n\nLes tombes sont en général des sépultures à incinération. Si la plupart du temps les tombes modestes ne livrent pas d'inscriptions, diverses observations ont été faites sur la répartition des épitaphes : les sépultures semblaient groupées par famille, au sens large, ainsi les Caecilii se voisinaient comme les Valerii ou les Terentii. Toutefois au sein d'une même famille, les tombes pouvaient être très disparates, très modestes ou plus luxueuses : cela pouvait correspondre à plusieurs branches de la famille, mais aussi aux tombes de la famille du maître et aux tombes de ses affranchis. Les nécropoles étaient le lieu de cérémonies et d'offrandes aux défunts, ces offrandes étaient souvent déposées sur des plats, parfois versées dans la tombe par l'intermédiaire d'un orifice.[réf. nécessaire] Ces offrandes étaient aussi l'occasion de banquets, coutume qui fut poursuivie à l'époque chrétienne, malgré le désaccord du clergé ainsi qu'en atteste Saint Augustin.\n\nLa forteresse byzantine\nLe fort byzantin de Timgad, située à environ 250 mètres au sud de la ville, au-dessus du site du sanctuaire de l'Aqua septimiana dont de nombreux éléments furent réemployés pour en faire un château d'eau. Les résultats des fouilles ont été publiés par Jean Lassus en 1981. De plan rectangulaire qui tend vers un trapèze et protégé par de puissantes tours d'angle, son enceinte fut construite en 539 par le patrice Solomon. Conservée sur 14 mètres de hauteur, elle encadre un périmètre de 120 mètres par  80 mètres. La construction du fort utilisa de nombreuses inscriptions en réemploi. Le fort abritait des casernements dans sa partie orientale. La partie occidentale rassemblait les installations communes, un réservoir d'eau, une piscine du sanctuaire réutilisée, une chapelle édifiée sur le podium des temples antérieurs, des thermes pour la garnison. Ces derniers d'une surface de 200 mètres carrés ouvraient directement sur la place de la forteresse. La fouille de ces aménagements intérieurs s'est révélée très riche, car une épaisse couche de terre les avait protégés des injures du temps. Le mur de la forteresse est renforcé par huit tours et l'entrée principale se trouve près de la tour centrale nord. Le fort est composé d'une chapelle, d’une piscine, d’un bâtiment pour l'état-major qui est situé entre le bain et la chapelle et d’une cour d’honneur. La piscine a été transformée en château d'eau.\n\nLes inscriptions latines\nDurant les fouilles de l'année 1941, dans la partie ouest du Fort byzantin, une  dédicace à Jupiter a été  trouvée, l'autre a été inscrite sur une pierre de calcaire bleu, elle se trouvait le long d’un petit mur parallèle à l'ancien Musée au côté sud. Au Fort byzantin, la dédicace à Mercure Auguste a été localisée lors des fouilles entre 1945 et 1946, sur la voie centrale est-ouest, côté est.\nÀ l'intérieur de l'Ancien Musée se trouvait un petit autel de calcaire bleu qui porte la dédicace à Mercure Silvain. En Afrique, les dédicaces religieuses honorent ensemble  Mercure et Silvain. La dédicace à Caelestis figure parmi les fragments repérés au dépôt de la Porte Nord de Timgad. Sur la face ouest du Fort byzantin, la dédicace à la Dea Patria a été trouvée, les lettres sont peintes en rouge. Une autre aurait été localisée à l'emplacement du sanctuaire principal du fort durant les fouilles de 1942 sous forme de  base hexagonale de calcaire blanc, contenant une partie arrondie qui sert probablement de support à une statue. Une autre inscription est trouvée, elle représenterait une commémoration à une offrande par des citoyens de Timgad à Dea Patria. Dans la représentation, on y voit une défense d'éléphant, un médaillon en terre cuite. Ce médaillon ressemblerait à une figure au Musée de Timgad, cette figure représente une femme couronnée d’une dépouille d'un éléphant et elle tient dans le bras gauche une cornucopia et sur sa main droite un vexillum.\nLe fragment de base dédié au Génie de la Colonie a été trouvé lors des fouilles de 1941 au Fort byzantin sur la face ouest. Et en 1942, une autre a été détectée à l'est du bassin du fort byzantin. Une des dernières dédicaces au Génie de la Colonie a été localisée à l'entrée de la curie pendant les fouilles de 1945 et 1946. Plusieurs ex-voto ont été trouvés à l'ancien musée sur le mur  nord et sur l'une  des vitrines. La dédicace à Fortune Vénus Aug a été retracée à l'ouest dans la maison de Gorfidius, vers l'ouest, près de la porte nord.\nLa curia Commodiana de Timgad, qui comprend cinquante-deux curiales, s'est adressée à Diane Auguste en 211 à 212.\nPlusieurs inscriptions impériales ont été récupérées sous forme de fragment lors des fouilles au fort byzantin, au mur sud de l'Ancien Musée, à proximité de la chapelle du patrice Grégoire en 1937, au Forum, au dépôt lapidaire de la Porte nord et dans des maisons avoisinant le site de Timgad.\n\nMosaïques\n235 pavements de mosaïque ont été répertoriés dans le site de Timgad par Suzzane Germain et ont fait l'objet d'étude. L’ensemble des mosaïques  géométriques et florales a été probablement créé dans un atelier à Timgad à partir des premières années du IIIe siècle. Cet ensemble sert au décor des maisons des riches et des thermes durant le IIIe siècle et IVe siècle. Les mosaïques des églises byzantines auraient été faites entre le IVe siècle et VIe siècle.\n\nHistorique des fouilles\nRedécouverte du site\nC'est en 1765 que le voyageur anglais James Bruce signala le premier l'existence de ruines romaines importantes à Timgad. De fait, seuls les monuments les plus importants émergeaient (le sommet de l'arc de Trajan, le capitole, le théâtre et la forteresse). Les dessins que Bruce fit du site ne furent toutefois diffusés qu'à partir de 1877. Le site fut par la suite visité par Louis Renier en 1851 dans le cadre d'une mission épigraphique. Il récolta soixante-dix inscriptions et repéra le forum. La mission de Renier fixa des orientations historiographiques durables, en particulier l'idée que les vétérans de Timgad devaient avoir un rôle militaire contre les autochtones : la redécouverte de Timgad se faisait désormais dans le contexte colonial français et en a été profondément marquée. Émile Masqueray visita Timgad en 1875, donnant l'année suivante un long rapport dans la Revue africaine. Il décrivait la ville en détail, signalant de nombreux monuments et publiant nombre d'inscriptions nouvelles, en particulier l'album des décurions. Quelques années plus tard, en 1880, une véritable exploration archéologique des ruines commença.\n\nLes fouilles françaises\nC'est sur décision du ministère de l'instruction publique et des beaux-arts que des fouilles commencèrent, dans les années 1880 à Timgad, ainsi un poste d'architecte en chef des monuments historiques d'Algérie a été créé, dans le but de gérer le service des monuments historiques d'Algérie et de s'occuper des chantiers de fouille et de restauration.\nL'architecte en chef effectue, chaque année, une tournée de quelques semaines pour rédiger un rapport et devait l’envoyer au Ministère de l'Instruction publique et des Beaux-arts et au gouverneur général à Alger. De Paris viennent les instructions sur les travaux à entreprendre et les informations  concernant les fouilles sont stockées. La Chaire d'Histoire et d'Antiquités de l'Afrique de l'École supérieure des Lettres d'Alger a une seconde autorité sur l'intervention au niveau de l'organisation des chantiers de fouilles et des musées.\nEdmond Duthoit, qui réside en France, est le premier à prendre la direction des travaux pour le déblayage de Timgad. Albert Ballu lui succède après son décès en 1889, il reste trente-huit ans à la tête du Service des Monuments historiques de l'Algérie, pendant lesquels il entreprend la restauration de plusieurs monuments romains et organise les plus importants chantiers de fouilles de l'Algérie (Timgad, et Djemila). Il rédige alors chaque année un rapport faisant état de l'évolution des travaux publié dans le Journal officiel de la République française pour le ministère de l'Instruction publique et des Beaux-arts.\nEn 1927, c'est Marcel Christofle qui est devenu architecte en chef. Il a été nommé par le gouverneur général d’Alger. Son fils, Marcel-Henri Christofle travaille avec lui. À Timgad, en 1938, ils ont réalisé, avec l'aide de l'Entreprise Perret, le musée. Marcel-Henri Christofle devient à son tour l'architecte en chef des monuments de l'Algérie.\nLes fouilles entreprises vers la périphérie du site, dans la région du fort byzantin et de la nécropole du sud, ont été dirigées par Charles Godet, inspecteur des Monuments historiques à Timgad depuis trente ans. Les recherches ont été ralenties par son décès en 1945. Par la suite, René Godet succéda à son père à la tête des fouilles du site. Après sa nomination, il meurt dans un accident d'hélicoptère au début de la guerre d'indépendance algérienne. La mort de René Godet a laissé un vide énorme pour la recherche ; il fallait reprendre le projet de Louis Leschi pour publier les recherches du fort byzantin. Leglay est alors chargé de la publication des recherches pour le fort byzantin et Jean Lassus se charge de l’étude de la forteresse, selon le rapport publié en 1955.\nÀ partir de 1948, la nécessité de protéger le site archéologique et de loger au mieux les habitants de Timgad a conduit au projet de la construction d’une ville nouvelle, conçue selon les normes de l’architecture contemporaine. Les Services de l'Urbanisme et des Antiquités de l'Algérie décident de la création d'une nouvelle ville afin de sauvegarder le site étalé sur 60 ha de ruines et aussi de regrouper une population agricole dans un réseau urbain moderne.\nAprès l’échec d’un premier projet, la conception et la construction de la nouvelle cité furent confiées à Roland Simounet en 1957, la ville nouvelle devait être construite à 1 000 m au nord des ruines de la ville romaine. Simounet proposa une ville aux rues étroites occupant une superficie de 6 ha, utilisant une architecture aux formes simples adaptées à l’environnement local et aux conceptions modernes pour le bien-être des habitants. La construction fut menée à bien malgré la guerre d’Algérie et ses restrictions grâce à l’usage de plusieurs techniques utilisant des matériaux locaux.\n\nLes fouilles depuis 1962 et préservation du site\nClassée au patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO, la ville de Timgad n'a pas fait  l'objet de fouilles depuis 1962. La conservation et la restauration du site ne sont pas sans poser problème. Timgad est exposée aux dégradations climatiques et humaines. Conservation et valorisation du site suscitent des inquiétudes et des débats.\nDes critiques ont été formulées de manière récurrente à l'occasion de l'organisation du festival annuel qui avait lieu dans les ruines et pouvait les dégrader, à cause des nombreux visiteurs, qui exercent une grande pression sur le sol de la cité due à l'escalade et au piétinement des structures fragiles, des passages répétés d'engins et de véhicules de service sur des structures vulnérables, des graffitis et des déchets.\n\nEn 2001, dans le cadre d’une évaluation générale de la conservation des mosaïques antiques en Algérie, Ferdi Sabah notait un état de conservation satisfaisant pour les mosaïques de Timgad, à la différence d’autres sites du patrimoine algérien comme Lambèse, Sétif ou Tébessa. Parmi les causes de dégradations sans compter les causes des phénomènes naturels, comme les tremblements de terre ou intempéries qui n'ont jamais eu d'impact sur le site, il y a l’insécurité des régions rurales, le manque de spécialistes en restauration, le manque d’intérêt culturel pour les antiquités, les difficultés d’un pays émergent.\nUn nouveau théâtre a été érigé à proximité du site, à l'imitation du plan du théâtre romain, d'une capacité de 5 000 places, en réalisation sur un terrain de 6 497 m2, ce projet, inscrit en 2007 à l'indicatif du secteur de la culture pour une première enveloppe de 10 millions de dinars algériens, sera mené à son terme au moyen d'un financement qui peut atteindre 240 millions de dinars, a-t-on également précisé. Ce sera la première fois que les soirées de ce prestigieux festival se tiendront en dehors des vestiges du théâtre romain. Il est destiné à accueillir le festival international et doit donc participer à la préservation du site. Financé à partir de 2007 et correspondant à des travaux d'une valeur de 251 millions de dinars algériens, il est opérationnel depuis l'édition de 2010 du Festival international. Toutefois des critiques ont été formulées quant à son emplacement et sa pertinence si près du site.\nSur le plan juridique il y a trois lois, la 1re est la loi no 90-29 du 1er décembre 1990 relative à l'aménagement et l'urbanisme, qui vise une disposition particulière applicable à certaines parties du territoire, comme le mode de clôture, l'aménagement, la sauvegarde et la mise en valeur de l'environnement du patrimoine naturel, culturel et historique. La 2e loi no 90-30 du 1er décembre 1990 (Portant loi domaniale) qui classe les monuments publics, les musées et les sites archéologiques comme étant un domaine public artificiel. La 3e est la loi no 98-04 du 15 juin 1998 relative à la protection du patrimoine culturel, qui définit le patrimoine culturel, et les règles de sa protection, de sa sauvegarde et de sa mise en valeur, et le plan directeur d'aménagement et d'urbanisme de la commune de Timgad.\nLe site archéologique est mis sous le plan de protection et de mise en valeur des sites archéologiques (abrégé : PPMVSA), un instrument juridique et technique qui détermine toutes les actions de conservation et de gestion du bien. Le décret exécutif no 03-323 est paru dans le journal officiel et a été signé par Ahmed Ouyahia.\nL'Office de gestion et d'exploitation des biens culturels est l'organisme de gestion du site en collaboration avec la direction de la culture de la wilaya de Batna. Il a pour but de mettre à exécution toutes les missions de service public de protection, d'entretien, d'inventaire et développe des programmes de valorisation et de promotion.\n\nMusée de Timgad\nSitué à l'entrée du site, le musée conserve et présente de nombreuses sculptures, mosaïques, inscriptions ainsi que des petits objets (poteries, lampes, verrerie, ustensiles en bronze, monnaies, fibules) trouvés dans la fouille du site ou de ses environs. On y accède par une vaste cour, agrémentée de colonnes et de statues. On peut admirer des sculptures de divinités gréco-romaines, comme pour les bustes de Mercure et d'Apollon, la statue de la Fortune, les têtes de Sérapis et d'Esculape provenant du fort byzantin. Des bas-reliefs, des stèles dédiés à Saturne (Baal Hammon des Numides) provenant des environs de Timgad et de Lambafundi, sont exposés. Le musée possède une statue de l'empereur Lucius Verus, des nymphes soutenant des coquilles trouvées dans les thermes du Sud. À l'intérieur du musée, un vase colossal représente le sacrifice et l'Amour de Psyché et enfin figurent de nombreuses inscriptions.\nUne porte, qui fut celle de la chapelle de Patrice Gréoire, donne accès à des salles, où sont exposées de nombreuses mosaïques qui ont servi de décoration et qui ont été souvent retrouvées dans les thermes ou dans des  riches demeures privées, comme la mosaïque Neptune sur son char, Vénus, Diane au bain, etc. Le musée est un élément important de la préservation du site et de ses richesses, il a cependant dû faire face à un vol dans la nuit du 27 septembre 1993. En 2001 , un autre vol a été  signalé par la Gendarmerie nationale algérienne à la suite de la disparition du portrait de l'empereur Hadrien.\n\nFilmographie\n2017 : Timgad de Fabrice Benchaouche.\n\nBibliographie\n: document utilisé comme source pour la rédaction de cet article.\n\nRachid Réda Daoud Brixi, L'Ecomusée : Les Aurès: Tazoult et Timgad, Alger, OPU, 2011, 136 p., 21X30 (ISBN 978-9961-0-1458-5)\nNabila Oulebsir, Les usages du patrimoine: monuments, musées et politique coloniale en Algérie, 1830-1930, Paris, MSH, 2004, 411 p.

Il s'agit de la dernière « déduction de colonie » en Afrique romaine, c'est-à-dire d'une colonie essentiellement peuplée de citoyens romains (souvent d'ailleurs d'anciens soldats). Bâtie avec ses temples, ses thermes, son forum et son théâtre, la ville, initialement d'une superficie de 12 hectares, finit par en occuper plus de 90. Au vu de son excellent état de conservation et du fait qu'on la considérait comme typique d'une ville romaine, Timgad est classée au patrimoine mondial de l'humanité par l'UNESCO en 1982. La conservation du site soulève cependant un certain nombre de problèmes.",

          "content": "## Overview\nTimgad is a town as well as the ruins of a Roman city in Northeast Algeria. The ruins are a  UNESCO World Heritage Site. Timgad lies on the northern slopes of the Aurès mountains and was created as a military colony by the Emperor Trajan in 100 AD. It is an excellent example of the grid plan as used in Roman town planning.\n\n## Understand\nThe city was founded as a military colony to serve primarily as a Roman bastion against the Berbers in the nearby Aures Mountains. At first, it was populated largely by Roman veterans and colonists. Although most of them had never seen Rome before, and Timgad was hundreds of miles away from the Italian city, Trajan invested heavily in Roman culture and identity. The full name of the city was Colonia Marciana Ulpia Traiana Thamugadi. Trajan named the city in commemoration of his mother Marcia, eldest sister Ulpia Marciana, and father Marcus Ulpius Traianus.\nAt the time of its founding, the area surrounding the city was a fertile agricultural area, about 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) above sea level. Located at the intersection of six roads, the city was walled but not fortified. It was designed for a population of around 15,000, but the city quickly outgrew its original specifications and spilled beyond the orthogonal grid in a more loosely organized fashion.\nThe city enjoyed a peaceful existence for its first several hundred years. It became a centre of Christian activity starting in the 3rd century, and a Donatist centre in the 4th century. In the 5th century, the city was sacked by the Vandals before falling into decline. Timgad was then destroyed at the end of the 5th century by Berber tribes from the Aurès Mountains. In 539 AD, during the Moorish wars, the Byzantine general Solomon retook and rebuilt the city, incorporating it into Byzantine North Africa. The reconquest revived some activities in the city, which became part of a line of defense against the Moors. However, the early Muslim conquests brought about the final ruin of Timgad as it ceased to be inhabited by the 8th century.\nBritish explorer James Bruce reached the city ruins on 12 December 1765, likely being the first European to visit the site in centuries and described the city as “a small town, but full of elegant buildings.” In 1790, he published the book Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile, where he described what he had found in Timgad. The book was met with skepticism in Great Britain until 1875 when Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain's consul in Algiers, inspired by Bruce's account, visited the site. In 1877 Playfair described Timgad in more detail in his book Travels in the Footsteps of Bruce in Algeria and Tunis. According to Playfair, “These hills are covered with countless numbers of the most interesting mega-lithic remains”. The French colonists took control of the area in 1881, began investigations into the site and maintained it until 1960. Timgad was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982.\n\n## By car\nFrom Constantine you can arrange a private car and driver for the day for around DA10,000.\n\n## By bus\nFrom the Constantine bus station (Gare SNTV, or \"Santivi\", sometimes called Gare Routiere Est), take a bus to the Batna north bus station. Then take the local bus number 7 from the front of the north station to the Batna east bus station. From the east bus station, take the bus to Timgad, which will drop you off at the ruins. The entire journey will take about 3 hours. To return from Timgad, the bus will not pick you up at the ruins, so you need to walk back up the road (Rue des Ruines Romaines), past the petrol station, until you reach a run-down bus station. Once you arrive in Batna, you may need to take a shared taxi back to Constantine for around DA300, as there are no buses to Constantine in the afternoon.\n\n## Get around\nThe town is small and walkable. The ruins you will tour on foot.\n\n## See\nThe entrance fee for the ruins is DA100. You can obtain a guide for US$5-10, and you may even be able to find one that speaks a bit of English. There are guidebooks sold at the entrance gate for DA400, but know that these contain mostly pictures with little textual information.\n35.488266.468931 Timgad Museum.

          "content": "Djémila (Arabic: جميلة, romanized: Ǧamīlah, lit. 'Beautiful (one)'), formerly Cuicul, is a small mountain village in Algeria, near the northern coast east of Algiers, where some of the best preserved Roman ruins in North Africa are found. It is situated in the region bordering the Constantinois and Petite Kabylie (Basse Kabylie).\nIn 1982, Djémila became a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique adaptation of Roman architecture to a mountain environment. Significant buildings in ancient Cuicul include a theatre, two fora, temples, basilicas, arches, streets, and houses. The exceptionally well preserved ruins surround the forum of the Harsh, a large paved square with an entry marked by a majestic arch.\n\nRoman Cuicul\nUnder the name of Cuicul, the city was built 900 metres (3,000 ft) above sea level during the 1st century AD as a Roman military garrison situated on a narrow triangular plateau in the province of Numidia. The terrain is somewhat rugged, being located at the confluence of two rivers. \n\nCuicul's builders followed a standard plan with a forum at the center and two main streets, the Cardo Maximus and the Decumanus Maximus, composing the major axes. The city was initially populated by a colony of Roman soldiers from Italy, and eventually grew to become a large trading market. The resources that contributed to the prosperity of the city were essentially agricultural (cereals, olive trees and farm).\nDuring the reign of Caracalla in the 3rd century, Cuicul's administrators took down some of the old ramparts and constructed a new forum. They surrounded it with larger and more impressive edifices than those that bordered the old forum.  The terrain hindered building, so that they built the theatre outside the town walls, which was exceptional.\nIn late antiquity, Cuicul was situated within the Roman province of Mauretania Sitifensis, and had an estimated population of around 10,000. Christianity became very popular in the 4th century (after some persecutions in the early third century), and by the fifth century, an ecclesiastical quarter was built, including three basilicas, a baptistery, auxiliary rooms, a bath, and a peristyle house. These structures are located to the south of Cuicul in a quarter called \"Christian\", and are popular attractions. \nOf the bishops of Cuicul, Pudentianus took part in the Council of Carthage (255) concerning the validity of heretical baptism, and Elpidophorus in the Council of Carthage (348). Cresconius was the Catholic bishop who represented Cuicul at the Council of Carthage (411) between Catholic and Donatist bishops; the Donatist bishop of the town died before the conference began. Crescens was one of the Catholic bishops whom the Arian Vandal king Huneric summoned to Carthage in 484. Victor was at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553. No longer a residential bishopric, Cuicul is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\nThe city was slowly abandoned after the fall of the Roman Empire around the 5th century and 6th century. There were some improvements under emperor Justinian I, with wall reinforcements.\nMuslims later dominated the region, but did not reoccupy the site of Cuicul, which they renamed Djémila (\"beautiful\" in Arabic).\n\n3D documentation\nThe spatial documentation of Djémila took place during two Zamani Project field campaigns in 2009, which were undertaken in co-operation with Prof Hamza Zeghlache and his team from the University of Setif, Algeria, as well as the South African National Research Foundation (NRF). Several structures were documented, including the Baptistry, the Caracalla Gate, the Market, the Septimius-servus Temple and the Theatre.\n\nNotable residents\nSeveral significant Romanized Africans were born in Cuicul:\n\nLucius Alfenus Senecio: governor of Britannia (205 to 207).\nGaius Valerius Pudens: governor of Britannia.\nTiberius Claudius Subatianus Aquila: governor of Mesopotamia and Egypt.\nTiberius Claudius Subatianus Proculus: governor of Numidia.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nMauretania Caesariensis\nVolubilis\nList of cultural assets of Algeria\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial UNESCO Site for Cuicul-Djémila\nPhotos of Cuicul (Djemila)\nDjemila Multimedia\nImages of Djemila in Manar al-Athar digital heritage photo archive",

          "content": "Djemila (de l'arabe : جميلة, « la belle » ; Ǧmila en berbère), anciennement Cuicul,\nest une cité antique située sur le territoire de la commune éponyme de Djemila, dans la wilaya de Sétif, en Algérie. Le site de Djemila abrite les vestiges de l'antique Cuicul, cité romaine, classée patrimoine mondial par l'Unesco.\n\nHistoire\nLa colonie de Cuicul fut fondée sur un sol accidenté au nord de l'Algérie à la fin du Ier siècle (en 96) probablement par les vétérans de Nerva ; son nom est celui d’un village ou d’un lieu berbère qui n’avait pas encore été latinisé. C'est avant Timgad l'une des dernières colonies de déduction en Afrique romaine.\nSous les Antonins (96 à 192) la ville s’embellit d’un forum, d’un capitole, de plusieurs temples, d’une curie, d’un marché  et d’un théâtre. Avec la construction des grands thermes le règne de Commode marque l'extension de la ville vers le sud.\nSous les Sévères (192 à 235) de nouveaux quartiers s’organisent au sud du forum, autour d'une vaste place, de nouvelles rues sont tracées, et la ville devient peu à peu une cité où il fait bon vivre, où se développent de luxueuses demeures.\nVers le milieu du IIIe siècle, une crise économique faisant suite à de mauvaises récoltes paralysa le commerce et freina le développement de la ville.\nL'Antiquité tardive voit Cuicul continuer une vie urbaine dynamique. Au IVe siècle, la conversion au christianisme de la population insuffla un regain d'activité et d'expansion urbanistique avec l'érection d'un quartier chrétien. Un baptistère et une basilique s'implantent à l'extrémité sud de la ville, une basilique civile est construite sur la place sévérienne. Les maisons luxueuses des notables ne cessent d'être développées atteignant des superficies considérables, s'équipant en thermes privés et se donnant des espaces de réceptions considérables (basiliques privées). La maison d'Europe ou celle de Castorius révèlent cet art de vivre des riches notables locaux et ont conservé un important décor de mosaïque.\nCuicul est occupée en 431 par les Vandales qui y persécutent les chrétiens jusqu’à leur départ après les accords conclus avec Genséric en 442.\nLorsque la ville fut reconquise par les Byzantins, elle retrouva un semblant de stabilité et d’activité, mais tomba dans l’oubli à la fin du VIe siècle.\nC'est en 1909, après la construction d'une voie d'accès, que des fouilles méthodiques furent entreprises par le service des Monuments Historiques. Mme de Cresolles, archéologue, a dirigé le dégagement des ruines jusqu'en 1941. Mlle Y. Allais, qui a résumé l'histoire de la ville, lui succéda en 1942 jusqu'à sa retraite en 1956.\nAu vu de l'état de conservation des ruines, la ville a été classée au patrimoine mondial de l'humanité en 1982.\n\nLe site\nCuicul est érigée à 900 mètres d'altitude sur un site d'importance stratégique, à la croisée des routes nord-sud (N/S) d'Igilgili à Lambèse et est-ouest (E/O) de Cirta à Sitifis.\nBâtie sur une dorsale montagneuse entourée de ravins, la ville était d'accès difficile donc facile à défendre et la surveillance, à partir des sommets alentour, en était aisée.\nEn raison de l'étroitesse de l'éperon sur lequel elle est construite, la cité, édifiée sur un plan incliné, a une configuration grossièrement triangulaire de 365 mètres de hauteur, sur une superficie d'environ 80 000 m2. Elle se compose de trois parties : la vieille cité ou quartiers nord; la nouvelle cité ou quartiers sud et le quartier dit \"chrétien\" au sud-est.\nCes dernières années ont vu la réalisation d'un musée, que l'on rejoint à partir des quartiers sud par une allée bordée d'arbres et de prairies, près de l'entrée du parc archéologique situé dans la partie la plus basse de la ville de Djemila.\n\nLes monuments\nLes édifices de Cuicul sont décrits dans l'ordre chronologique de leur édification, mais aussi de leur situation géographique en remontant le cardo, depuis la porte d'Igilgili au nord, jusqu'aux thermes, après avoir traversé la porte sud et la place Sévérienne.\n\nLa vieille cité\nLe cardo maximus\nLe cardo maximus, qui se confond avec la route de Lambèse, présente une situation excentrée épousant le rebord occidental de l'éperon. À hauteur du forum, il croise le decumanus maximus. Le pavage est remarquablement conservé, mais quelques dalles brisées permettent de voir les canalisations d'eaux usées. Les piliers et colonnes bordant le cardo portaient à l'époque une toiture qui abritait les passants.\nDans la galerie ci-dessous, les vues successives remontent le cardo du nord au sud :\n\nLe forum\nLe forum était la place publique où les citoyens se réunissaient pour marchander et traiter des affaires de la cité. Situé à la croisée du cardo et du decumanus, le forum a une superficie de 2 000 m2. Il a conservé son dallage régulier. Il était autrefois entouré de portiques et de statues sur leur piédestal, dont il ne reste aujourd'hui que les colonnades qui le délimitent au sud. Au centre du forum se trouve un vaste autel monumental de la seconde moitié du IIIe siècle orné de bas-reliefs.\nÀ Cuicul, le forum a été conçu comme un complexe architectural regroupant un ensemble de bâtiments publics administratifs et religieux : au nord, le Capitole et le marché ; au sud, le temple de Venus Genetrix ; à l'ouest, la basilique judiciaire et la prison ; à l'est, la Curie.\n\nLa Curie\nLa Curie est située au nord-est du forum, à proximité du Capitole. Tout comme la basilique civile, c'est aujourd'hui un vaste quadrilatère nu, bordé de blocs de taille. Dans l'Antiquité, la Curie était revêtue de placage d'onyx et son sol était pavé de marbre rouge.\n\nLe Capitole\nLe Capitole est consacré aux cultes de Jupiter, Junon et Minerve. Situé au nord-est du forum, c'est le centre religieux et politique de Cuicul. Il est de forme carrée et constitué de six pièces. L'autel des sacrifices subsiste en avant de l'escalier d'accès au sanctuaire : ses énormes colonnes de 14 mètres de haut se sont écroulées sur le forum.\n\nLe marché de Cosinius\nLe macellum est l'un des monuments les plus évocateurs de la ville. Une plaque commémorative nous apprend que le marché fut offert à la ville par un riche citoyen du nom de Lucius Cosinius Primus.\nC'est une halle rectangulaire de 28 × 23 mètres de côté, attenante au Capitole. On y accède par une porte qui donne sur une cour à ciel ouvert entourée d'un portique dont seules les colonnes en marbre ont survécu. Au centre, vestiges d'une fontaine hexagonale sculptée sur laquelle on peut lire deux inscriptions dédicatoires à Mercure, dieu du commerce. Sous le portique, on recense 17 boutiques dont l'accès est barré par un comptoir en pierre. Entre les colonnes, du côté sud, une tablette de pierre ornée de sculptures, qui comporte trois cavités rectangulaires de tailles différentes, servait à la mesure du grain et des liquides.\n\nLa basilique judiciaire\nLa basilique judiciaire occupe la partie ouest du forum sur une superficie de 532 m2. Elle fut érigée en 169 sous le règne de l'empereur Lucius Verus. Elle servait de palais de justice et de bourse de commerce.\n\nLe temple de Venus Genetrix\nCe sanctuaire est dédié à Vénus, déesse de l'amour et la beauté. César introduisit Vénus Génitrice, déesse de la maternité et du foyer. Le temple a conservé ses colonnes de granite.\n\nLes habitations\nDes vestiges tels que des mosaïques, des colonnades, des piscines et fontaines témoignent de la richesse de certaines demeures qui possédaient salles de réception et latrines privées. La maison d'Europe, la maison de l'Âne vainqueur, la maison de Castorius en sont les exemples les plus remarquables.\n\nLa ville nouvelle\nLa nouvelle cité s'est développée au-delà des remparts sud détruits, au voisinage du théâtre et des grands thermes qui datent d'une époque antérieure. Elle possède tous les attributs d'une ville romaine.\n\nLa place des Sévères\nAu centre géographique de Cuicul, le nouveau forum (ou place des Sévères) sépare les anciens quartiers des nouveaux. C'est une vaste esplanade en pente de 3 200 m2, aménagée à la fin du IIe siècle et au début du IIIe siècle, dominée à l'ouest par l'arc de Caracalla et à l'est par le temple Septimien.\nLa place des Sévères est le point de départ de cinq rues. Les deux rues situées au nord traversent la vieille ville, la troisième rue passe sous l'arc de Caracalla, rejoint la route de Sétif et la quatrième mène au théâtre. La cinquième rue prolonge le cardo, traverse la place et conduit vers les thermes et le quartier chrétien.\nSur cette place se trouvaient de nombreux édifices publics et religieux. De part et d'autre de l'arc s'élèvent le perron d'un temple, qui a pu servir de tribune aux harangues, et les restes d'un château d'eau ; un peu en arrière, une vaste salle avec abside, le marché aux étoffes et une salle de latrines publiques. Mitoyenne au temple Septimien, une basilique judiciaire a remplacé à la fin du IVe siècle un temple de Frugifer Saturne.\nAu nord subsiste un alignement de colonnade, seul vestige des portiques disposés des deux côtés de la place.\n\nArc de Caracalla\nL'arc de triomphe fut érigé en 216, en l'honneur de l'empereur Caracalla, de sa mère Julia Domna et de son père défunt Septime Sévère. Au-dessus d'une inscription dédicatoire, sur le fronton, les trois socles supportaient leurs statues. D'autres statues occupaient les niches à colonnettes. Construit à l'entrée de la route de Sétif, cet édifice de 12,5 mètres de haut livre accès à la place des Sévères.\nEn 1839, le duc d'Orléans, de passage à Djemila avec un corps expéditionnaire, le vit et conçut le projet de le faire transporter à Paris pour l'ériger sur une place, avec l'inscription « L'Armée d'Afrique à la France ». Après sa mort, en 1842, alors que le transfert était prêt, le projet fut abandonné.\n\nTemple Septimien\nLe temple Septimien, qui domine la plus grande partie de la ville, a été dédié en 229, sous le règne de Sévère Alexandre, à la Gens Septimania, famille nord-africaine originaire de Leptis Magna, qui arriva au pouvoir avec Septime Sévère, en 193.\nLe temple, situé à l'angle sud-est de la place des Sévères, est assis sur une plate-forme flanquée de colonnades à laquelle on accède par un escalier de seize marches. Cette esplanade supporte un second podium ou soubassement de l'édifice qui comprend un nouvel escalier et une façade de colonnes corinthiennes de plus de 10 mètres de haut. La porte par laquelle on accède à l'intérieur du temple a un cadre rectangulaire à moulures, inscrit dans une arche ouverte ; elle était ornée des effigies de Septime Sévère et Julia Domna.\n\nThéâtre\nLe théâtre fut érigé en 161, sous le règne de Marc Aurèle et Lucius Verus, par Caius Julius Crescens et Caius Julius Didius Crescentianus, deux notables Cuiculitains. Bâti à l'extrémité orientale de la ville, il est adossé à la colline sur laquelle s'est développé par la suite le quartier chrétien. On y accède par un chemin qui contourne la colline à sa base et qui s'ouvre sur la place des Sévères par une arche à double baie.\nSes gradins sont disposés en demi-cercle autour de l'orchestre et devant la scène. Il pouvait accueillir 3 000 spectateurs qui accédaient aux gradins grâce à un réseau de galeries couvertes (vomitorium). La scène est large et basse. Le décor se compose d'un mur orné de colonnades, de niches et de statues.\n\nLa fontaine conique\nLa fontaine conique est située dans la grande rue des nouveaux quartiers, prolongement du cardo maximus, à proximité immédiate des thermes. C'est un remarquable monolithe conique qui occupe le centre d'un bassin circulaire ; l'eau était amenée au sommet par une conduite logée dans une saignée verticale que l'on peut distinguer en faisant le tour de la structure. Cette fontaine est du même type que la Meta Sudans qui se dressait à proximité du Colisée de Rome.\n\nLes grands thermes\nConstruits en 183 sous le règne de l'empereur Commode, les grands thermes couvrent une superficie de 2 600 m2. Les différentes salles – vestiaires (apodyterium), gymnase, étuve sèche (laconicum), étuve humide (sudatorium), bain chaud (caldarium), bain tiède (tepidarium), bain froid (frigidarium) – sont distribuées selon un plan symétrique.\nLes murs revêtus de marbre et le sol recouvert de mosaïques étaient chauffés à l'aide d'un système d'hypocauste. La vapeur d'eau provenant d'une salle attenante où l'on chauffait le combustible (praefurnium) était évacuée dans l'épaisseur des murs. L'une des salles chauffées possède encore en partie les doubles parois nécessaires à la distribution d'air chaud. Le bâtiment continue au nord par une grande terrasse dallée qui offre un vaste panorama sur la ville.\n\nLa maison de Bacchus\nLa maison de Bacchus couvre une superficie d'environ 7 000 m2. Elle se compose de deux salles à absides et de plusieurs péristyles et jardins où pouvaient se réunir diverses sociétés, notamment les adorateurs de Bacchus.\n\nLe quartier chrétien\nLa période chrétienne (IVe siècle) a laissé des monuments d'un grand intérêt : deux églises à cryptes toutes pavées de mosaïques, un riche bestiaire et des inscriptions, une petite chapelle, un baptistère en forme de rotonde accompagné de bains, un vaste ensemble de loisirs et des locaux dont une partie a dû servir au logement du clergé. Une inscription indique que la ville est restée sous l'autorité romaine jusqu'en 476.\n\nMusée de Djemila\nLe musée de Djemila est situé à l'entrée du parc. Il abrite les pièces archéologiques découvertes sur le site. Il regroupe une collection unique, par le nombre et la variété, de mosaïques d'une rare fraîcheur de coloris, représentant des sujets mythologiques, comme celle du sanctuaire de Bacchus (28 m2), inspirée de la légende de Dionysos.\nLe musée est composé d'un jardin, d'une cour et de trois salles couvertes. Le jardin conserve des chapiteaux, colonnes, stèles votives ou funéraires, et inscriptions diverses. Dans la cour sont exposées des mosaïques et des sculptures, dont les têtes de Septime Sévère et de Julia Domna.\nLes salles présentent aux murs et au sol d'immenses mosaïques qui ornaient les demeures et les édifices de Cuicul : la toilette de Vénus, l'âne vainqueur, l'Enlèvement d'Europe par Jupiter métamorphosé en taureau, des scènes de culte de Dionysos, un bestaire, l'enlèvement d'Hylas par les nymphes, la scène de la grande chasse.\n\nPersonnalités originaires de Cuicul\nUn certain nombre de personnages importants de l'administration romaine sont tenus pour originaires de Cuicul, on peut mentionner\n\nLucius Alfenus Senecio, gouverneur de Britannia de 205 à 207 ;\nGaius Valerius Pudens (en), gouverneur de Britannia ;\nClaudius Subatianus Aquila, gouverneur de Mésopotamie puis d'Égypte ;\nClaudius Subatianus Proculus, gouverneur de Numidie en 208.\n\nCitation\n« Il est des lieux où meurt l'esprit pour que naisse une vérité qui est sa négation même. (…) Il faut beaucoup de temps pour aller à Djemila. Ce n'est pas une ville où l'on s'arrête et que l'on dépasse. C'est un lieu d'où l'on revient. La ville morte est au terme d'une longue route en lacets qui semble la promettre à chacun de ses tournants et paraît d'autant plus longue. Lorsque surgit enfin sur un plateau aux couleurs éteintes, enfoncé entre de hautes montagnes, son squelette jaunâtre comme une forêt d'ossements, Djemila figure alors le symbole de cette leçon d'amour et de patience qui peut seule nous conduire au cœur battant du monde. »— Albert Camus, Noces (1939), Le vent à Djemila\n\nL'actualité\nChaque année est organisé à Djemila un festival international de la chanson arabe, place des Sévères, qui en est, en 2011, à sa septième édition. En raison des dégradations causées au site, le festival se tiendra, à compter de 2012, sur un terrain extérieur jouxtant le musée.\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nArticles connexes\nItinéraire d'Antonin, Liste de voies romaines\nHistoire de l'Algérie dans l'Antiquité\nListe des noms latins des villes d'Algérie\n\nLiens externes\nDjémila sur le site de l'UNESCO\n\nBibliographie\nM Akli Ikherbane, Le site archéologique de Djemila, l'antique Cuicul: Éventail d'actions possibles, Les Dossiers d'archéologie, 2003\nE.

It was subsequently turned into a military colony by the emperor Claudius for the conquest of the kingdoms of Mauretania.\nAfterwards, it became a municipium called Colonia Aelia Tipasensis, that reached a population of 20,000 inhabitants in the fourth century according to Stéphane Gsell.\nThe city served as an important Christian hub during the last centuries of Roman governorship, with three basilicas.\nTipasa was destroyed by the Vandals in 430 CE, but was reconstructed by the Byzantines one century later. At the end of the seventh century the city was demolished by Umayyad forces and reduced to ruins.\nIn the nineteenth century, the place was settled again. Now it is a town of nearly 30,000 inhabitants. The city is an important tourist place in modern Algeria, mainly because of the Tipasa ruins.\n\nModern era\nNear Tipaza, the Tipaza longwave transmitter broadcasts French language Channel 3 radio programs from the Algerian Broadcasting Company. The longwave frequency 252 kHz can be well received in many parts of Europe.\nThe town and its surroundings are home to the largest Berber-speaking group of western Algeria, the Chenoua people. Majority of the Bouriba family reside in this area.\nThe Tipaza station in 252 kHz had previously been out of service since March 17, 2014, but is broadcasting again at 252 kHz.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of lighthouses in Algeria\nTipasa\nTipaza Province\nAin Taya Forest\nEl-Marsa Forest\nAlgeria\nMahelma Forest\nBologhine Forest\nEl-Mouradia Forest\nBachdjerrah forest\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nTipasa Museum\nSite of Unesco",

حسب\nإحصائيات عام 2008 وتتربع على مساحة قدرها\nتعد مدينة تيبازاة من المدن التاريخية بالجزائر إذ أسسها الفينيقيون كإحدى مستعمراتهم التجارية العديدة حيث كانت لها مكانة مرموقة.\nمرت عليها العديد من الحضارات والشعوب من الأمازيغ و الفينيقيين والرومان والوندال والبيزنط وتجسد ذلك في الموقع الأثري الذي يتربع على 65هآ مما جعلها قبلة لعشاق السياحة الأثرية كما تتمع البلدية بالعديد من الشواطىء الساحرة والتي أقيمت بشأنها العديد من المؤسسات الفندقية التي تستقطب بدورها المصطافين الباحثين عن الإستجمام خاصة في فصل الصيفمساحتها 18 كلم² و هي عاصمة ولاية تيبازة\n\nالتسمية\nمعنى تيبازة في اللغة الفينيقية (الممر) لأنها كانت معبرا وممرا للناس بين مدينتي إيكوزيم (الجزائر) وإيول (شرشال).\nثم أصبحت تعرف بقرطاجية. وقد اكتشف بتيباسا مستعمرة فينيقية تعود للقرن الـ 5 ق.م. وعندما جاء الرومان حولوها إلى مستعمرة تتبع لاتيوم، ثم تحولت إلى مستعمرة تتبع روما في عهد الإمبراطور كلاوديوس (41-54م). وكان أول والي لها بن عمار ضياء الدين\n\nجغرافيا\nتضاريس\nتوفر التضاريس على مسافة 3 كيلومترات المحيطة بتيبازا تباينات مهمة في الارتفاع، مع تباين في الارتفاع يصل إلى 241 مترًا بحد أقصى وارتفاعًا أقل من مستوى البحر بمقدار 53 مترًا. في 16 كيلومترًا، توجد اختلافات مهمة في الارتفاع (897 مترًا). في الـ 80 كيلومترًا، توجد اختلافات كبيرة في الارتفاع (1810 مترًا).\nالمنطقة في حرير 3 كيلومترات من تيبازة مغطاة بالمياه (42%)، والأراضي المزروعة (27%)، والمسطحات المائية (11%)، في حرير يبلغ طوله 16 كيلومترًا بالمياه ( 42٪) والأراضي المزروعة (36٪) وفي حرير يبلغ طوله 80 كيلومترًا من المياه (46٪) والأراضي المزروعة (30٪).\n\nمناخ\nحرارة\nيستمر الموسم شديد الحرارة لمدة 3.0 أشهر، من 20 يونيو إلى 18 سبتمبر، مع درجة حرارة يومية أعلى من 29 درجة مئوية كحد أقصى. يكون الشهر الحار من السنة في تيبازة هو الأعلى، مع درجة حرارة معتدلة بحد أقصى 32 درجة مئوية وأدنى 22 درجة مئوية\nيستمر الموسم الطازج لمدة 4.0 أشهر، من 21 نوفمبر إلى 22 مارس، مع درجة حرارة يومية أقل من الحد الأقصى إلى 19 درجة مئوية. يكون شهر الشتاء البارد في تيبازة في شهر يناير، مع درجة حرارة معتدلة تبلغ 7 درجات مئوية كحد أدنى و16 درجة مئوية كحد أقصى.\n\nتساقط\nمن أجل رصد التباين على مدار الشهر وليس فقط المجاميع الشهرية، نزيد من تراكم الريش على مدار فترة زمنية مدتها 31 يومًا في كل يوم من السنة. تحتوي تيبازة على اختلافات كبيرة في المواسم تتعلق بهطول الأمطار الشهرية.\nتستمر فترة السنة الغزيرة لمدة 9.1 شهرًا، من 4 سبتمبر إلى 6 يونيو، مع مجرى ريش أقل من 13 ملم خلال فترة لامعة مدتها 31 يومًا. شهر نوفمبر من أكثر الريش في تيبازة هو شهر نوفمبر، مع شلال من الريش يبلغ طوله 55 ملم.\nتستمر الفترة السنوية لمدة 2.9 شهرًا، من 6 يونيو إلى 4 سبتمبر. شهر الريش في تيبازة يكون ممتعًا، مع شلال من الريش يبلغ طوله 2 ملم.\n\nموقع\nتاريخ\nماقبل التاريخ\nالعهد الفينيقي\nبنى هذه المدينة وطورها الفينيقيون وهم الذين جلبوا معهم الزيتون وزرعوه فيها، كما أن أهل هذه المدينة كانت لديهم طقوس خاصة بالموت، حيث عُثر هناك على مقابر خاصة بالأغنياء، وأخرى خاصة برجال الدين، أما الأيتام فكانوا لا يدفنون، بل كانت تُرمى جثثهم للأسود الموجودة في مكان خاص بها في القلعة الحصينة.\nوتشير بعض الروايات إلى وجود تابوتين ملتصقين، كان يشتريهما الأغنياء لقبورهم الخاصة، حيث يكون قبرا الزوج والزوجة متلاصقين معاً، أملاً في أن تشاركه في رحلة الموت أيضاً. كما كانت هناك قبور عادية خاصة بالخدم تحيط بالقبر الكبير الخاص بعائلة الغني.\nومن أغرب طقوس الدفن في هذه المدينة، أن يأخذ الميت معه زجاجة صغيرة، وآنية فخارية، تحتوي إحداهما على دموع، والأخرى على عطر. فتكون الأولى شاهدة على أيامه والثانية من أجل استعمالها في رحلة البعث.\n\nالعهد الروماني\nبنيت المدينة الرومانية في تيباسا فوق ثلاثة تلال صغيرة متقابلة مطلة على البحر. وكانت البيوت السكنية في التلة الوسطى ولكن لم تبق لها آثار. وهناك آثار باقية لثلاث كنائس هي: البازيليكا الكبرى وبازيليكا إسكندر في التلة الغربية\nوبازيليكا القديسة سالسا في التلة الشرقية.\nأستخدمت البازيليكا الكبرى لقرون كمقلع للحجارة ولكن مخططها الذي قسم إلى سبعة أجنحة لايزال ظاهر للعيان. وقد اكتشف تحتها مقابر نحتت من الصخر الصلب من بينها قبر دائري قطره 60 قدم يسع لـ 24 كفن. أما بازيليكا القديسة سالسا فما زالت تحوي الفسيفساء وقد اكتشفها ستيفن غزل وتتكون من الصحن الرئيسي والجناحين. ويوجد في تيباسا كذلك متحف للآثار الذي يضم الكثير من الآثار رغم صغره.\nكان يحيط بالمدينة سور عظيم، طوله كيلومترات عدة، ويحيط بهذه المدينة 37 مركز حراسة، حيث يتم حراستها على مدار الساعة، خوفا من أي غزو. ولكن الطبيعة كانت قاسية حيث دمرت هذا السور العظيم، وأكلت المدينة، وغرق تحت البحر جزء منها، ولم يتم البحث تحت المياه، لأن هذه العملية تحتاج للكثير من البعثات العلمية.\nكانت لتيبازة مكانة تجارية معتبرة خصوصا في عهد أباطرة القرنين الثاني والثالث الميلاديين، ولكنها لم تتميز بالفن أو بالتعليم. وفي القرن الثالث الميلادي كانت تيبازة من مقرات الأساقفة المسيحيين، وقامت القديسة سالسا برمي رأس تمثال الإله الزائف إلى البحر، عندئذ قامت الجماهير الوثنية الغاضبة برجمها بالحجارة لتموت. وبأعجوبة كما تذكر الروايات عاد جسدها من البحر ودفن على التلة فوق الميناء في كنيسة صغيرة والتي أصبحت لاحقا البازيليكا الضخمة. وتوسعت المدينة كثيرًا، حيث وصل عدد سكانها في نهاية القرن الرابع الميلادي إلى 20 ألف شخص.\n\nالعهد الوندالي\nفي عام 484 م قام الملك الوندالي هينريك بإرسال أسقف من المذهب الأريوسي إلى تيباسا، عندئذ هربت أعداد كثيرة من سكان تيباسا إلى إسبانيا عن طريق البحر.\nوقد اضهد العديد من الذين بقوا بقسوة ووحشية. فتذكر المصادر القديمة أن السكان قطعت اياديهم اليمنى وألسنتهم ومع ذلك ظلوا يستطيعون الكلام.\nوفي سنة 534 م جاء البيزنطيون واحتلوا شرشال وتيباسا أيضا، وقد كانت الكاثوليكية عادت بشكل رسمي تحت عهد هيلديريك، بعد عام 523 م عندها عاد من هاجر من أبناء تيباسا من إسبانيا.\nبعد تلك الفترة بدأت المدينة تختفي من التاريخ وعندما جاء العرب المسلمون ولكنهم لم يستوطنوا بها\n\nالسكان\nالادارة\nالمواصلات\nالطرقات\nالطريق الوطني رقم 11\nالطريق الولائي رقم 109\n\nالاقتصاد\nالسياحة\nالاثرية\nتوجد في مدينة تيبازة مسارح يستلقي على ضفاف البحر الأبيض المتوسط، ومتاحف متحركة يزاوج بين الحضارة والطبيعة هي مدينة وفية لماضيها العريق الذي يرجع إلى آلاف السنين، حيث تفتح صفحاتها لزوارها لتروي لهم الآثار القديمة والحكايات المثيرة للحضارة الرومانية القديمة التي مرت عليها.\nوتأخذك المدينة في رحلة عبر الزمان لتجول بك في أحد أهم المعالم السياحية بالجزائر، لترسم بمخيلتك صور طبيعية وجميلة لمدينة تيبازة.\nتستقبلك مدينة تيبازة الواقعة على بعد 50 كيلومتر غرب العاصمة الجزائرية بنسبة من الهواء البارد تلامس وجنتيك لتمنحك الانتعاش، وتحسسك بروعة المناخ المعتدل للبحر الأبيض المتوسط وجمال الطبيعة الخضراء التي تزين حافة البحر وتمتعك بالتجول بين مختلف الأماكن السياحية المتطورة من فنادق فخمة وقرى سياحية ومطاعم فاخرة وأول محطة يتوقف عندها الزوار هي المدينة الرومانية المبنية فوق ثلاثة تلال صغيرة متقابلة مطلة على البحر، وكانت محاطة بسور عظيم و37 مركز مراقبة استعملها الرومان لحراسة المدينة التي كان جمالها وموقعها الجغرافي المتميز محل أطماع الكثيرين ونحتت الرياح البنايات لتحولها إلى تحف فنية تحتفظ المدينة بأطلال الماضي من القصور والمسرح والتماثيل والآثار وغيرها والتي تستقطب كاميرات كم هائل من السياح لتروي لهم روعة الحياة اليومية في عهد الاحتلال الروماني للمنطقة.\n\nالاستجمامية\nمركبات فندقية\nالخدمات\nوبالقرب من تيبازة يبث جهاز الإرسال على الموجات الطويلة في تيبازة برامج إذاعية للقناة الثالثة باللغة الفرنسية من شركة الإذاعة الجزائرية. يمكن استقبال تردد الموجة الطويلة 252 كيلو هرتز بشكل جيد في أجزاء كثيرة من أوروبا.\nتعد المدينة والمناطق المحيطة بها موطنًا لأكبر مجموعة ناطقة باللغة البربرية في غرب الجزائر شعب شنوة.\nكانت محطة تيبازة على التردد 252 كيلو هرتز خارج الخدمة سابقًا منذ 17 مارس 2014، لكنها تبث مرة أخرى على التردد 252 كيلو هرتز\n\nالصيد البحري\nالتعليم\nالتعليم

كل شيء لأن جزء كبير من المدينة ما زالت تحت الرواسب لإثبات ماتبقى من المدينة الأثرية على طول الشارع الذي يربط المتحف إلى الحديقة الأثرية، والتي هي قاعدة أربعة أقدام تحت مستوى الأرض الحالية.\nكما هو عليه الحال فهي عبارة عن أنقاض تتكون من اثنين من المناطق الكبيرة. الأولى، التي تقع خارج أسوار عند مدخل المدينة الحديثة، وهو مقبرة كبيرة لبازيليك القديس. والثاني هو الحديقة الأثرية، التي تقع على المشارف الغربية للمدينة الحديثة، التي تشمل معظم المعالم المكشوفة وميناء ومتحف.\n\nاعلام\nالقديسة سالسا\n\nمعرض صور\nوصلة خارجية\nتيبازة\n\nانظر أيضًا\nالفينيقيون في الجزائر\n\n\n== مراجع ==",

Elle est située à 61 km à l'ouest d'Alger.\nTipaza est à l’origine une fondation punique en Afrique du Nord. Comme toutes les villes du bassin méditerranéen, elle a été conquise par les Romains et faisait partie de la province romaine de Maurétanie-Césarienne.\nLa présence de la mer et des reliefs du Chenoua et du Dahra donne un paysage particulier présentant un intérêt touristique. De nombreux vestiges puniques, romains, chrétiens et africains attestent de la richesse de l'histoire de cette ville.\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nLe territoire de la commune se situe au nord de la wilaya de Tipaza.\n\nRoutes\nLa commune de Tipaza est desservie par plusieurs routes nationales :\n\nRoute nationale 11: RN11 (Route d'Oran).\n\nLocalités de la commune\nÀ sa création en 1984, la commune de Tipaza a réuni les domaines et localités suivants :\n\nHistoire\nLes Phéniciens ont fondé à cet emplacement, vers le Ve siècle av. J.-C.,  un comptoir d’où la ville tire son nom (« lieu de passage » ou « escale »)\nL’établissement s’est développé sous le règne du roi numide Juba II. Il est devenu Caesaria (l’actuelle Cherchell) l'un des foyers de la culture gréco-romaine en Afrique du Nord. Située dans l'aire d'influence de Carthage, Tipasa était alors une ville punique typique. À la fin de la troisième guerre punique et le siège de Carthage en 146 av. J.-C., Rome a annexé la Maurétanie.\nSous l'empereur romain Claude Ier, en 39, Tipasa prend le statut de municipe latin et se dote d'une muraille longue de plus de deux kilomètres. Hadrien éleva par la suite Tipasa au rang de colonie honoraire. À la fin du IIe siècle, la ville connaît son apogée avec une population qui s'élève, selon les estimations de Stéphane Gsell, à 20 000 habitants.\n\nAu IIe siècle, cette cité romanisée s’agrandit vers l’ouest aux dépens d’une ancienne nécropole punique. Bien qu’elle fût entourée d’une longue muraille de 2 km, cela n’a pas empêché sa destruction en l’an 430 par les Vandales menés par Genséric.\nTipasa a, en tant que port, une importance moindre que Caesarea. Son trafic maritime étant réduit au cabotage. Le site archéologique de Tipasa contient divers vestiges, dont les restes d'une basilique. Son théâtre avait une taille honorable.\n\nPopulation et Langages\nLa région est peuplée de Berbères Chenouis, ils parlent le Chenoui, une variante du berbère très proche du Chaoui et encore plus proche voir presque identique du Rifain dont les trois dialectes étant d'origines Zénète. La population Chenoui encore berbérophone est estimée aujourd'hui à un peu plus de 150 000 habitants. En termes de coutumes, artisanat et vêtements les Chenouis sont proches des Kabyles.\nAutrefois, le berbère était parlé dans toute la Dahra, notamment plus à l'ouest jusque dans les territoires de Zerrifa et Achaacha de la wilaya de Mostaganem et s'étendait ainsi de même de l'autre côté de la rivière du Chéliff, dans l'Ouarsenis, son recul notoire est principalement dû à la conquête française et les changements sociaux qui l'accompagnèrent.\n\nPatrimoine\nÀ l'inverse de Timgad et Djémila, dont les ruines apparaissent compactes et facilement lisibles, Tipasa présente un site éclaté : tout n'a pas été dégagé et une bonne partie de la ville, explorée en 1891 par Stéphane Gsell, est encore sous les sédiments.\nEn l'état actuel, les ruines forment deux grands ensembles. Le premier, situé en dehors des murs, à l'entrée de la ville actuelle, à droite de la route qui vient d'Alger, correspond à une grande nécropole avec la basilique Sainte-Salsa. Le second, c'est le parc archéologique, situé à la sortie ouest de la ville moderne, qui regroupe la majorité des monuments mis au jour.\nEntre les deux, près du port, le musée.\n\nInfrastructures\nL'émetteur de Tipaza est un émetteur grandes ondes qui transmet sur la fréquence 252 kHz un programme en langue française en direction de l'Europe. Cette émission peut être très bien reçue la nuit, en Europe.\n\nPersonnalités liées à la commune\nKader Klouchi, athlète et artiste français né le 1er juin 1969 à Tipaza.\nAmel Zen (Ibdouzen), compositrice, parolière et chanteuse née le 28 mai 1985 à Tipaza.\n\nRéférences à la commune\nDans \"Noces à Tipaza\", Albert Camus situe l'intrigue dans la commune et y fait plusieurs références.

          "content": "The Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania is a funerary monument located on the road between Cherchell and Algiers, in Tipaza Province, Algeria. \nThe mausoleum is the tomb where the Berber King Juba II (son of Juba I of Numidia) and the Queen Cleopatra Selene II, sovereigns of Mauretania, were allegedly buried. However, their human remains are no longer at the site.\nThe Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania is a common type of ancient mausoleums found in Algeria built on a hill some 250 metres (756 feet) above sea level. The monument is entirely built from stone, while its main structure is in a circular form with a square base topped by a cone or a pyramid. The square base measures 60 to 60.9 metres square or 200 to 209 foot. The height of the monument was originally about 40 metres or 130’ in height. Due to damage that the mausoleum has suffered from natural elements and vandalism, the monument now measures 30-32.4 metres in height. \nThe base of the monument was decorated with 60 Ionic columns whose capitals were removed, possibly stolen. Inside, the centre of the mausoleum has two vaulted chambers, separated by a short passage connected by a gallery outside by stone doors which can be moved up and down by levers. The passage leading to the chambers is about 500’. One chamber measures 142 feet long by 11 feet broad and is 11 feet high, while the other is smaller.\n\nHistory\nThe sepulchre is sometimes known as the Mausoleum of Juba II and Cleopatra Selene. In French, it is called the Tombeau de la Chrétienne (\"the tomb of the Christian woman\") because there is a Christian cross-like shape of the division lines on the false door. In Arabic, the mausoleum is called the Kubr-er-Rumia or Kbor er Roumia, which means \"tomb of the Christian woman\", as Rûm was taken in Arabic as the Eastern Roman Empire and, in North Africa, rumi took the meaning \"Christian\".\nIt may have been a deformation of a Punic phrase for \"the royal tomb\".\n\nRoyal Family of Mauretania\nThe mausoleum was built in 3 BC by the King of Mauretania, Juba II (son of Juba I of Numidia) and his wife Cleopatra Selene II. She was a Greek Ptolemaic princess, the daughter of the Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and Roman Triumvir Mark Antony. Through her marriage to Juba II, she became Queen of Mauretania.\nThe mausoleum is probably the Royal Tomb that the 1st-century Roman geographer Pomponius Mela (1.31) described as the monumentum commune regiae gentis (\"the communal mausoleum of the royal family\"). If the geographer’s description of the mausoleum is correct, then the building was not intended just for Juba and Cleopatra, but envisaged as a dynastic funeral monument for their royal descendants.\nThe Mauretanian sepulchre looks similar to the Mausoleum of Augustus erected by the first Roman Emperor Augustus in Ancient Rome. Augustus began constructing his mausoleum between 29 BC-27 BC, some time before Juba II left Rome to return to Numidia.\n\nUnder the Ottomans and French\nIn the 16th century, the mausoleum was believed by some Spaniards to be the tomb of Florinda la Cava, the legendary berber woman from Ceuta, whose rape led to the Islamic conquest of Iberia.\nIt has been explained as a confusion of Qabr Arrumiyya (\"Christian tomb\", locally qbér érromiya) and qàhba romiya (\"Christian whore\").\nIn 1555, the Pasha of Algiers, Salah Rais, gave orders to pull down the mausoleum. After large black wasps swarmed out and stung some of the workers to death, the effort was abandoned. At the end of the 18th century, Baba Mahommed tried in vain to destroy the monument with artillery.\nFollowing the French occupation of Algeria, the monument was used by the French Navy for target practice.\n\nRecognition and conservation of the Mausoleum\nThe human remains of Juba II and Cleopatra Selene have not been found at the site. This is perhaps due to a grave robbery that occurred at an uncertain time (possibly shortly after the Mausoleum's construction). It is also possible that the structure was simply meant to serve as a memorial and not an actual place of burial.\nThe Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania is a part of a unique archeological site along the road from Cherchell to Tipaza. On this archeological site, there are various monuments and infrastructure that have survived from the Phoenician (see also Carthage National Museum), Roman, Early Christianity and Byzantine periods. This group of ruins that are located along the Mediterranean Sea were recognized and inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982.\nAlthough these archaeological remains, including the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania, are protected, the ruins located between Cherchell and Tipaza face constant threats from continual urban construction and expansion, open sewage drainage run offs, poor maintenance, and constant vandalism. Due to these ongoing problems, these archaeological remains face an uncertain future.\nThe local authorities have failed and had problems implementing a 1992 ‘Permanent Safeguarding and Presentation Plan’ an effective management program in preserving these ruins. In 2001, the World Heritage Site provided emergency assistance for this archaeological site. In 2002, experts from UNESCO went to visit the site and to report on the condition of the ruins; the archeological site has been placed on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger.\n\nSee also\nBerber mythology\nMadghacen\nTin Hinan Tomb\nList of cultural assets of Algeria\n\nCitations\nSources\nDuane R.

          "content": "Hippo Regius (also known as Hippo or Hippone) is the ancient name of the modern city of Annaba, Algeria. It served as an important city for the Phoenicians, Berbers, Romans, and Vandals. Hippo was the capital city of the Vandal Kingdom from AD 435 to 439, after which it was shifted to Carthage following the Vandal capture of Carthage in 439.\nIt was the focus of several early Christian councils and home to Augustine of Hippo, a Church Father highly important in Western Christianity.\n\nHistory\nHippo is the latinization of ʿpwn (Punic: 𐤏𐤐𐤅‬𐤍), probably related to the word ûbôn, meaning \"harbor\". The town was first settled by Phoenicians from Tyre around the 12th century BC. To distinguish it from Hippo Diarrhytus (the modern Bizerte, in Tunisia), the Romans later referred to it as Hippo Regius (\"the Royal Hippo\") because it was one of the residences of the Numidian kings. Its nearby river was Latinized as the Ubus and the bay to its east was known as Hippo Bay (Latin: Hipponensis Sinus).\nA maritime city near the mouth of the river Ubus, it became a Roman colonia which prospered and became a major city in Roman Africa. It served as the bishopric of Saint Augustine of Hippo in his later years. In AD 430, the Vandals advanced eastwards along the North African coast and laid siege to the walled city of Hippo Regius. Inside, Saint Augustine and his priests prayed for relief from the invaders, knowing full well that the fall of the city would spell death or conversion to the Arian confession for much of the Christian population. On 28 August 430, three months into the siege, St. Augustine (who was 75 years old) died, perhaps from starvation or stress, as the wheat fields outside the city lay dormant and unharvested. Hunger and the inevitable diseases were ravaging both the city inhabitants and the Vandals outside the city walls who lifted the siege after 14 months. The peace treaty of 435 acknowledged the Vandals' possession of the city and King Geiseric made it the first capital of the Vandal Kingdom until the capture of Carthage in 439.\nIt was conquered by the Eastern Roman Empire in 534 and was kept under Roman rule until 698, when it fell to the Muslims; the Arabs rebuilt the town in the eighth century. The city's later history is treated under its modern (Arabic and colonial) names.\nAbout three kilometres distant in the eleventh century, the Berber Zirids established the town of Beled-el-Anab, which the Spaniards occupied for some years in the sixteenth century, as the French did later, in the reign of Louis XIV. France took this town again in 1832. It was renamed Bône or Bona, and became one of the government centres for the Constantine (departement) in Algeria. It had 37,000 inhabitants, of whom 10,800 were original inhabitants, consisting of 9,400 Muslims and 1,400 naturalized Jews. 15,700 were French and 10,500 foreigners, including many Italians.\n\nEcclesiastical history\nHippo was an ancient bishopric, one of many suffragans in the former Roman province of Numidia, a part of the residential see of Constantine. It contains some ancient ruins, a hospital built by the Little Sisters of the Poor and a fine basilica dedicated to St. Augustine. Under St. Augustine there were at least three monasteries in the diocese besides the episcopal monastery.\nThe diocese was established around 250 AD. Only these eight bishops of Hippo are known:\n\nSaint Theogenes(256? – martyr 259?)\nSaint Leontius (died 303?)\nFidentius (martyr ?304)\nValerius (388?–396), who ordained St. Augustine\nthe \"Doctor of Grace\", Saint Augustine (354 – 28 August 430, coadjutor in 395, bishop in 396)\nHeraclius (coadjutor in 426, bishop in 430).\nPalmatius, attended Synod of Carthage in 525\nUrban, circa 705\nIt was suppressed around 450 AD.\n\nCouncil of Hippo\nThree church councils were held at Hippo (393, 394, 426) and more synods – also in 397 (two sessions, June and September) and 401, all under Aurelius.\nThe synods of the Ancient (North) African church were held, with but few exceptions (e.g. Hippo, 393; Milevum, 402) at Carthage. We know from the letters of Saint Cyprian that, except in time of persecution, the African bishops met at least once a year, in the springtime, and sometimes again in the autumn. Six or seven synods, for instance, were held under St. Cyprian's presidency during the decade of his administration (249–258), and more than fifteen under Aurelius (391–429). The Synod of Hippo of 393 ordered a general meeting yearly, but this was found too onerous for the bishops, and in the Synod of Carthage (407) it was decided to hold a general synod only when necessary for the needs of all Africa, and it was to be held at a place most convenient for the purpose. Not all the bishops of the country were required to assist at the general synod. At the Synod of Hippo (393) it was ordered that \"dignities\" should be sent from each ecclesiastical province. Only one was required from Tripoli (in Libya), because of the poverty of the bishops of that province. At the Synod of Hippo (393), and again at the Synod of 397 at Carthage, a list of the books of Holy Scripture was drawn up, and these books are still regarded as the constituents of the Catholic canon.\n\nTitular episcopal see\nThe Hippo(ne) diocese was nominally revived in 1400 as Catholic Latin titular bishopric of the (lowest) episcopal rank, for which no incumbent is recorded.\nIt ceased to exist on 23 September 1867, when the see was formally united with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Constantine.\n\nSee also\nAuzia\nCaesarea of Mauretania\nCirta\nChullu\nMauretania Caesariensis\nMilevum\nList of cultural assets of Algeria\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nGigaCatholic, with residential episcopal incumbents biography links Archived 2016-03-04 at the Wayback Machine",

          "content": "Hippone (en latin Hippo Regius) est le nom antique de la ville d'Annaba, se trouvant au nord-est de l'Algérie. Elle devint l'une des principales cités de l'Afrique romaine. Saint Augustin est évêque de la ville de 395 jusqu'à sa mort en 430 alors que les Vandales assiègent la ville.\n\nHistoire\nHippone est « le golfe du roi » dont le nom remonte à la Préhistoire, à la suite d'un affaissement dans la masse cristalline du massif de l'Edough. Elle abrite un comptoir phénicien au XIe siècle av. J.-C., une agglomération punique prospère alliée de Carthage. Au IIIe siècle av. J.-C. c'est une métropole numide du roi berbère Massinissa. En 46 av. J.-C., Juba Ier, allié de Pompée, est défait par les troupes de Jules César à la bataille de Thapsus. Hippone est annexé à la province romaine d'Africa Nova, créée par Jules César.\n\nDans l'Empire romain, Hippone connaît la richesse et le faste. Elle est l'une des grandes villes de l’Africa Nova et son marché le plus opulent. Au Ve siècle, Hippone devient le foyer du christianisme sous l'épiscopat d'Augustin d'Hippone, évêque de la ville de 395 à sa mort en 430, qui sera canonisé par Rome en 1248.\n\nHippone, assiégé par les Vandales de Genséric en 430, résiste pendant quatorze mois. Les Vandales sont inexpérimentés dans l'art d'assiéger une place bien défendue et Genséric lève le siège, peut-être poussé par des problèmes de ravitaillement ou de maladies.\nAprès que les renforts envoyés par l'Empire d'Orient et d'Occident ont été battus par les Vandales en 431, Hippone est finalement prise par ceux-ci la même année et intègre l'éphémère royaume vandale. Le général byzantin Bélisaire reprend la ville en 533 lors de la guerre des Vandales, et la ville retourne dans le giron romain de l'Empire byzantin. Elle assiste à l'expansion de l'islam, et, en 705, Hippone tombe alors sous la coupe des Omeyyades et sera baptisée \"bilâdou el anâb (pays des jujubiers).\n\nAu XIe siècle, les Sanhajas bâtissent la ville de Madinat Zaoui distante de trois kilomètres, occupée quelques années par les Espagnols et les Français au XVIe siècle.\n\nHistoire ecclésiastique\nLe diocèse d'Hippone est établi vers 250 ; six évêques sont répertoriés. Cet évêché est supprimé vers 450.\nTrois conciles se tiennent à Hippone en 393, 394 et 426, ainsi que plusieurs synodes en 397 et 401.\n\nArchéologie\nDécouverte et fouilles\nLe dossier archéologique d'Hippone s'ouvre au début du XIXe siècle avec la redécouverte de quelques mosaïques et épitaphes dans le quartier de la villa dite \"du front de mer\".\nLe site archéologique prend de l'importance grâce à Erwan Marec, qui parvient à convaincre le préfet de Constantine de stopper le développement du faubourg industriel qui menaçait d’engloutir d’éventuelles ruines antiques. Il est parvenu ainsi à sauver 25 ha du site antique de la destruction[à vérifier]\n\nBasilique chrétienne\nL'un des grands chantiers d'Erwan Marec sur le site archéologique d'Hippone est celui du quartier chrétien et de la recherche de la Basilique de la Paix (Basilica pacis), c'est-à-dire l'église cathédrale dans laquelle Augustin d'Hippone était évêque entre 395 et 430.\n\nEn 1958 Erwan Marec publiait un article dans lequel il attribuait sa découverte d’un édifice à trois nefs à l’antique Basilique de la Paix.Cette basilique est d'un plan basilical, jouxtée d'un baptistère. Mais d'autres historiens et archéologues émettent des doutes sur cette attribution (Serge Lancel, Henri-Irénée Marrou, Noël Duval). Pour ces derniers, le manque de sources et de sépulture épiscopale autour de la basilique, infirme l'hypothèse de E. Marec. Il se peut néanmoins que cette basilique chrétienne soit celle des donatistes présents dans la ville à l'époque de l'épiscopat de saint Augustin. Par ailleurs, les archéologues pensent qu'une seconde basilique située au sud du site archéologique, pourrait être la Basilica pacis d'Augustin. Ils y ont trouvé une grande quantité d'objets d'aspects religieux (fragments d'arceaux timbrés anépigraphes comportant une croix, une table en marbre pouvait être un autel, des épitaphes épiscopales…) et des inscriptions épigraphiques d'époque byzantine témoignant d'une forte activité religieuse permettant de conclure qu'il s'agit vraisemblablement de la Basilique antique d'Augustin à laquelle aurait succédé une importante cathédrale byzantine sur le même site.\n\nForum\nLe forum est le lieu central de la vie politique d'une cité romaine. Celui d'Hippone comporte une vaste esplanade rectangulaire bordée par des galeries sur les côtés est, ouest et nord. Son area mesure 42m x 75m et elle est recouvert par un dallage constitué de blocs de calcaire gris bleu. Une grande dédicace \"C. Paccius Africanus, pontife consul, proconsul, patron du municipe d'Hippone\" permet de dater le revêtement des années 78-79 (époque flavienne).\nLe forum présente les traces d'un petit temple de 9,60m x 9,10m entouré d'une colonnade.\nDe nombreuses traces du culte impérial ont été retrouvées aux abords du forum avec la découverte de deux bustes d'Auguste et de Vespasien, quatorze inscriptions épigraphiques à la gloire de divers empereurs (Claude, Titus, Vespasien, Antonin, Septime Sévère, Gordien et Valens).\n\nEnfin, deux statues monumentales de Minerve et Hercule en marbre de Paros ont été dégagées du site, ainsi qu’un trophée en bronze aujourd’hui conservé au musée du site archéologique.\n\nMarché\nDégagé en 1955, le marché (macellum) constitue également un élément typique de la vie romaine. Présentant en son centre une rotonde (tholos) et bordé d’une colonnade, c’est un lieu central de la vie artisanale d’Hippone.\n\nThermes\nOn recense une dizaine d’ensembles thermaux répartis dans les différents quartiers, dont deux sont des ensembles publics. Un de ces complexes thermaux, est surnommé les «grandes thermes du nord». Avec un frigidarium d’une superficie de 450m²\nUn système de canalisations permet à la ville d’alimenter en continu les thermes et les nombreuses fontaines publiques dont nous avons des traces par la présence de bouches de fontaines retrouvées sur le site archéologique. De grandes citernes construites sous Hadrien permettent de stocker l'eau en grande quantité.\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\n: document utilisé comme source pour la rédaction de cet article. \n\nAndré Mandouze, Prosopographie chrétienne du Bas-Empire, 1 : Prososopographie de l’Afrique chrétienne (303-533), Paris, Éditions du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 1982 (ISBN 978-2-222-02174-2, lire en ligne).\n(en) Andy Merrills et Richard Miles, The Vandals, Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, 368 p.

          "content": "## Overview\nM'zab is a limestone plateau in Saharan Algeria and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its collection of desert fortress-cities is exotic to the point of surrealism.\n\n## Understand\nThe M'Zab Valley is a deep, desert valley dotted with five walled cities from the 11th century. Although each one is independent of the other, Ghardaïa is often used to refer to all five collectively. Each town sits on top of a rocky outcrop, with the surrounding sandstone houses leading up to a tall minaret that doubled as a watchtower. The architecture of the cities is of a Libyan-Berber style. The old town centres often contain large, fortress-like mosques and public buildings, with narrow lanes weaving down the hill to the walls. These cities sit within an oasis filled with palm and fruit trees, where locals would traditionally dwell in the hot summer. The locals have retained much of their tradition and customs, and travellers will be able to recognise this while visiting the area.\n\n## Cities\nM'zab is made up of five separate \"cities,\" which essentially serve as separate urban centers of one large \"Pentapolis,\" home to over 350,000 people.\nBeni Isguen\nBounoura\nEl-Ateuf\nGhardaïa — the largest city of the valley, with a population over 100,000.\nMelika — a small and less remarkable center, but one that offers the best views of both Ghardaia and Bounoura.\nOutside the Pentapolis of the valley, there are two other Mozabite oasis towns far to the north:\nGuerrara\nBérianne\n\n## Get in\nIt is possible to fly into Ghardaia from Algiers as Air Algerie has a few flights every week.

          "content": "Ghardaïa (Arabic: غرداية, Tumzabt: Taɣerdayt) is the capital city of Ghardaïa Province, Algeria. The commune of Ghardaïa has a population of 93,423 according to the 2008 census, up from 87,599 in 1998, with an annual growth rate of 0.7%.\nIt is located in northern-central Algeria in the Sahara and lies along the left bank of the Wadi Mzab. The M'zab in the Ghardaïa Province was made a World Heritage Site in 1982, as a cultural property evaluated under the criteria II (for its settlement affecting urban planning even to the present century), III (for its Ibadi cultural values), and V (a settlement culture which has prevailed to the present century).\nGhardaïa is part of a pentapolis, a hilltop city amongst four others, built almost a thousand years ago in the M’Zab valley. It was founded by the Mozabites, an Ibadi sect of the Berber Muslims.\nIt is a major centre of date production and the manufacture of rugs and cloths. Divided into three walled sectors, it is a fortified town. At the centre is the historical Mʾzabite area, with a pyramid-style mosque and an arcaded square. Distinctive white, pink, and red houses, made of sand, clay and gypsum, rise in terraces and arcades.\nIn her 1963 book, La Force des choses, the French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir described Ghardaïa as \"a Cubist painting beautifully constructed\".\n\nEtymology\nThe name of Ghardaïa has its origins in a female saint named Daïa who lived in a cave (ghār) in the area before it blossomed into a town inhabited by Ibadi Muslims who came to escape persecution from the Fatimid Caliphate in the north.\n\nHistory\nThe M'Zab valley, in limestone plateau, was inscribed under the UNESCO Heritage List, is a unique conglomeration of five cities confined in area of 75 km² situated 600 km to the south of Algiers, the capital of Algeria.\nThe original architecture of the semi desert valley is dated to early 11th century. It is ascribed to the Ibadis, with their cultural identity originally traced to the Maghreb; they had their capital at Tahert as an Ibadi Kingdom. They were forced to leave Tahert consequent to a devastating fire in 909 (it is reported that destruction was caused by the founder of the (Shi'ite) Fatimid Dynasty). They first moved to Sedrata and finally to the M'Zab valley. They settled in five fortified villages located on rocky outcrops, known locally as “Kosars”, although they could have lived in one larger village encompassing all the five. The habitation was planned with meticulous details to precise layouts defined by set principles of community living within a defensive environment. Ghardaïa's foundation has been dated to 1048 or 1053.\nEach village was planned in a diverse topography comprising a small island, a ridge, a hilltop, a peak and a recess. The villages were fortified in such a manner that they were inaccessible to the nomadic groups. The five villages set up with identical planning concepts were Ghardaïa, Melika, Beni Isguen, Bou Noura and El Atteuf. The identical “miniature citadels”, as they are termed, each had their own mosque with minaret functioning as watch towers, and the houses built around the mosque in concentric circles and surrounded by a high walls (extending up to the ramparts). The buildings together gave the feel of a fortress to each village. The mosque also provided for storage of grains and arms for defence.\nHowever, during the summer season the inhabitants migrated to a \"citadel\" outside the fortified villages, in an informal setting of artificial palm grove, a cemetery and a mosque.\nThe ksar was created in 476/1085 by two tribes : the Aoulad Ammi-Aïssa and the Aoulad Ba-Slimane. Each tribe contained different fractions, a specific area and a cemetery. Ghardaïa is the richest city of the M'Zab Vallée. It already had a dynamic commercial and craft activity. On the social aspect, it is the only Ksar, along with Melika, that housed not only Ibadites Berbers, but also Malekits Arabs and a Jewish community until the Algerian Independence.\nTo build the Ksar, the founders of Ghardaïa, a small group of people, under a Cheikh, chose a hill 200m south of the M'Zab Oued for defensive purposes. Farther west, they created a palm grove for subsistence farming. The Ksar of Ghardaïa, as it is today, did not appear in one time. According to the public agency in charge of protecting the M'Zab Heritage, Ghardaïa has seen four phases of evolution until 1882, when it was annexed by the French army.\n\nGeography\nThe city is located within the Sahara Desert in northern-central Algeria. Ghardaïa Province is divided into 13 communes or municipalities, which includes the Ghardaïa municipality. It is bordered by Ouargla and El Bayadh Wilayas. It is nestled in the M'zab valley, lying on the left bank of the Wadi Mzab, which is commonly dry throughout the year. The commune of Ghardaïa now covers an area of 590 km2 (230 sq mi) and includes a number of suburbs, towns and villages in addition to Ghardaïa. Suburb settlements include Mélika, Béni Isguen, Bounoura (Has Bunur) and El Atteuf (Tadjnint), all of which lie to the southeast of Ghardaïa city and the ancient ksar of Metlili-Chaamba or Metlili which lies 42 km (26 mi) to the southwest. Outside of the Mzab Valley, Berriane (Has Ibergane) and El Guerrara (Iguerraren) are towns of note, the first 45 km (28 mi) to the north, and the second 110 km (68 mi) to the northeast.\n\nHydrology\nGhardaïa's ancient water distribution system was devised by the Mozabites, as a response to the ephemeral flows of its oueds (rivers). Realising the preciousness of this natural resource, the Mozabites developed a unique hydraulic system of tunnels to harvest rainwater and divert it to the oases. They have an equitable water distribution to all gardens and also maintain good flood protection measures. The water supply is accessed in a number of ways through a complex irrigation system that distributes water from many wells. Well drilling extends to a depth ranging from 350 ft (110 m) to 500 ft (150 m), drawing the water from the Albian fossil groundwater continental infill whose reserves are estimated at 1.5 trillion m3.\n\nClimate\nGhardaïa has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), with extremely hot summers and mild winters. The region is marked by large temperature differences between day and night, and summer and winter ranging from lows of 5 °C (41 °F)  to highs of 46 °C (114.8 °F). The prevailing winds of summer are extremely hot, extremely dry and strong, while winter winds are warm and dry. Sandstorms generally occur from March to May. In October 2008, Ghardaïa was severely affected by flooding due to heavy rain.\n\nLayout and architecture\nThe unique layout of the Ghardaïa village is dictated by the rocky terrain of the region. Apart from the mosques and the housing pattern layout, with the mosque at the top of the hill, and the houses laid in labyrinthine alleyways, there is also a large market centre. The houses in particular are oriented in such a way that admits sunlight into every dwelling, as this is strongly believed to be healthy: \"Inhabitants of the house where sun comes in will never see a doctor\". Chimneys are also set in such a way that they do not encroach upon the comfort of neighbours.\n\nEconomy\nGhardaïa is a major centre of date production, with nearly 60,000 palm trees producing dates. The wood of dead palms is used to make house roofs; live trees are not killed, as they are considered living beings that sustain the inhabitants.\nAnother important industry is the manufacture of rugs and cloths.\nMetlili-Chaamba is known for its \"Deglet Nour\" dates and its camel hair products. One important aspect of the social life and economic values of the people of the region is that begging and theft are non-existent in the community. The society is close-knit, and all aspects of economy and social customs are dictated by the community.\n\nCulture\nThe residents have preserved the original medieval architecture remarkably well; the valley to which Ghardaïa belongs is part of an official World Heritage Site. The Medabian quarter lies to the northwest. The military compound and hospital are located in the southern area. The city is called \"the pearl of the oasis\", and is one of the most important tourist regions in southern Algeria due to its ancient cultural heritage. Apart from tourism, the Wilaya of Ghardaïa also draws anthropologists, architects, researchers and historians to explore its rich cultural, anthropological and architectural uniqueness. An interesting aspect of community welfare is the fact that they follow the rules of governance diligently, and also contribute to the maintenance and care of the community. Mozabites in the light of their rigid approach in negotiations, dominate the financial sector, particularly in banking and wholesale sectors. They also have their own mosque, cemetery, recreation and sporting activities. They have a patriarchal system of social inheritance. Another unique feature among the Mozabites is that starting from birth a “Mozabite is looked after by the community for education, work, marriage, and the building of a home. Touiza (groups of volunteers) are organised for building houses.” The Wilaya of Ghardaïa is also well known for its Weaving, Dinanderie D'art, basketry, pottery and carpet weaving (tapestry). The rugs of the area are so popular that every year the \"National Day Of Rugs\" is held in March.\nThe Mozabites of Ghardaïa have their distinct identity of traditional costume of saroual loubia (baggy trousers) and chéchia (headgear).\n\nFestivals\nEvery spring, the commune of Metlili-Chaamba, 31.3 km (19.4 mi) from Ghardaïa, celebrates the \"Day mehr\" when people from all over the country attend and participate in a camel race.\nIn March and April, a carpet festival provides an opportunity for celebration, competition, as well as sales.\n\nReligion\nGhardaïa is the traditional heart of the M'zab valley and home of the Ibadi religious sect in Algeria. They do not subscribe to the doctrines of Sunnism and Shi'ism. They practice a different way of praying, worshipping of God, and designing mosques compared to Malikis, who form the majority of Algerians. The wastage of water, and more generally any gift of land, is considered a sin. The Ghardaïa Mosque, built in the 10th century, is of Moorish architecture style. Its tower, simple and elegant, includes a large portal at the top of the shaft, the design of which provides for ventilation flow.\nThe White Fathers, a Roman Catholic missionary society, live in a hermitage near the old city, and have a collection of books on the Sahara. The pro-cathedral still testifies to the time when it was the seat from 1901 successively of the Apostolic Prefecture of Ghardaïa; the province was renamed as the Apostolic Prefecture of Ghardaïa in the Sahara, in 1948 promoted to the Apostolic Vicariate of Ghardaïa in the Sahara, and then in 1955 was promoted to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Laghouat (where the cathedral is meanwhile secularized; the diocese is still exempt).\n\nJewish Sign Language\nUntil Algerian independence, Ghardaïa was home to a significant Jewish community, of which many were deaf. The deaf Jews of Ghardaïa developed their own village sign language, which they took with them when the community left for France and Israel. The language is considered moribund.\n\nEducation\n6.5% of the population has a tertiary education, and another 18.2% has completed secondary education. The overall literacy rate is 87.4%, and is 93.2% among males and 81.5% among females.\n\nTransportation\nThe town is served by Noumérat – Moufdi Zakaria Airport (or simply Ghardaïa airport). There is also a bus station. The airport is named after Algerian writer Moufdi Zakaria, who was born in Ghardaïa.\n\nLocalities\nThe commune of Ghardaïa is composed of nine localities:\n\nNotable people from Ghardaïa\nMoufdi Zakaria, Mozabite poet from At izjen Beni isgen, authored the national anthem\nCheikh Bayoud, Mozabite leader of the reformist movement in the south.\nMokhtar Belmokhtar, Algerian former military commander of al-Mulathameen (The Masked Brigade).\n\nGallery\n\n\n== References ==",

Son agglomération qui s'étend sur plusieurs communes, compte environ 140 000 habitants en 2008.\n\nGéographie\nLocalisation\nLe territoire de la commune de Ghardaïa est situé au Nord de la wilaya de Ghardaïa, au centre de l'Algérie dans le Nord du Sahara algérien, à 600 km au sud d'Alger, à 190 km au sud de Laghouat, à 270 km d'El Menia et à 190 km à l'ouest de Ouargla.\n\nGhardaïa est la ville la plus importante de la pentapole (cinq villes) du Mzab. Elle est située en amont de la vallée, et s'organise autour d'une colline.\n\nTransport\nLa ville est située sur la RN 1 et constitue un relai sur le grand axe méridien Alger/Laghouat/Ghardaïa/Tamanrasset, et le centre de gravité du territoire nord saharien, au point de rencontre des deux grandes « boucles » sahariennes, celle de l'ouest vers Timimoun et la Saoura et celle de l'est par Ouargla et l'Oued Righ.\nGhardaïa dispose d'un aéroport situé à 19 km au sud-est de la ville. Des vols opérés par la compagnie Air Algérie relient Ghardaïa à la capitale algérienne, Alger, et aux villes du Sud algérien : Illizi, Djanet et Tamanrasset.\n\nLocalités secondaires\nEn 1984, la commune de Ghardaïa est constituée à partir des lieux-dits suivants :\n\nLe ksar de Melika était considéré comme ville sainte du Mzab, avant d'être remplacé par celui de Beni Isguen. Melika renferme notamment le mausolée du Cheikh Sidi Aïssa et de sa famille.\n\nClimat\nGhardaïa a un climat désertique chaud, avec des étés extrêmement chauds et des hivers doux. La région est marquée par de grandes différences de température entre le jour et la nuit, et l'été et l'hiver.\n\nToponymie\nSelon la légende, Ghardaïa, signifie « Grotte de Daïa » (Ghar Daïa), on raconte qu'une jeune fille du nom de Daïa vivait seule dans une grotte. Le cheikh Sidi Bou Gdemma, passant par là, est séduit par sa beauté, ils se marient et fondent alors Ghardaïa.\nLe nom amazighe de la ville est « Taɣerdayt », aussi orthographiable « Tagherdayt » . Le découpage administratif de 1985 standardise l'appellation en arabe Ghardâyya, perçue comme neutre puisque ne choisissant ni le nom tumzabt Taghardayt, ni le nom arabe Ghârdâyya.\nLe nom berbère provient de ighir, tghrut (pluriel tighardin), « épaule », avec un diminutif taghardit, attesté dans les parlers de l'Aurès. Le mozabite, lui, connait taghrudt (pluriel tighrudin). Ghardaïa doit ce nom à la forme de son site, en forme d'omoplate.\n\nHistoire\nÀ partir du Xe siècle, après la chute du royaume Rostémide par les Fatimides, les réfugiés de Tahert s'établissent à Sedrata près d'Ouargla. Puis, ils atteignent la région de la Chebka du Mzab. Au XIe siècle, ils bâtissent la pentapole du Mzab : Ghardaïa, Melika, Beni Isguen, Bounoura et El Atteuf. Ghardaïa est fondée en 1048 ou 1053 sur la rive droite de l'Oued M'zab et en amont des quatre autres centres de la Pentapole.\nSituée sur l'axe du méridien d'Alger, qui est une pénétrante idéale vers le Sud, la ville devient rapidement la capitale commerciale du Mzab, et constitue un relai du commerce caravanier transsaharien. Elle est l'une des principales cités à bénéficier dès le XIVe siècle de cette manne et a acquis le statut de cité « opulente » de la pentapole. Ce trafic était encore prospère au XVIIIe siècle.\nLors de la conquête coloniale française, le Mzab, qui avait en 1853 bénéficié d'une convention d'autonomie, est annexé en 1882. Toutefois, les particularités de gestion interne des cités mozabites sont respectées . En 1902, lors de la création des Territoires du Sud, Ghardaïa est incorporée au Territoire de Ghardaïa qui avait comme chef-lieu Laghouat. Après la départementalisation du Sahara algérien en 1957, elle est intégrée à l'arrondissement de Laghouat dans le département des Oasis.\n\nAprès l'indépendance de l'Algérie, en 1984, elle a été érigée en chef-lieu de wilaya. Au début d'octobre 2008, la ville a connu la plus grande inondation depuis 50 ans. Plusieurs dizaines de victimes, des blessés et des centaines de maisons détruites.\n\nDémographie\nLa commune de Ghardaïa compte 93 423 habitants selon le recensement de 2008, la population de l'agglomération qui s'étend sur la vallée du Mzab, est de 140 000 en 2008, contre 50 000 habitants en 1966.\nHistoriquement, le ksar de Ghardaïa était le plus peuplé de la Pentapole, il concentrait en 1872 environ 13 000 habitants, suivi des ksour de Beni Isguen, d'El Atteuf, de Melika et de Bounoura.\n\nSociété\nGhardaïa est une ville composite qui comprend une communauté mozabite importante, une population berbère, de confession ibadite, mais également une forte minorité arabe, de confession malékite.\nLa ville a toujours été associée à ces deux populations ; en 1955, le ksar rassemblait 14 000 habitants, dont 8 000 ibadites et 6 000 malékites. Il y avait une communauté juive au Mzab qui a pratiquement disparu quelques années après l'indépendance de l'Algérie.\nEu égard à  la diversité ethno-confessionnelle de la région, des émeutes récurrentes ont eu lieu ces dernières décennies, qui opposent les deux principales communautés ibadite et malékites. Toutefois, ces évènements ne sauraient être réduits à un simple conflit communautaire. Les tensions entre communautés révèlent plutôt l'implication de quelques catégories sociales et économiques face à la rareté du foncier dans la vallée du Mzab et la régression du rôle de l'État algérien ; ce qui envenime les rapports sociaux dans la région.\nD'autre part, des mécanismes différenciés d'intégration dans le jeu politique nationale, ainsi qu'aux périodes de sédentarisation différenciées des populations ont engendré des rivalités sociales et économiques entre des populations arabophones paupérisées et les Mozabites mieux organisés et plus autonomes par rapport à l'État. Les demandes s'articulent sur une distribution sociale « équitable » entre populations du Mzab et engendre des concurrences locales autour de la contribution des différentes communautés à la guerre d'indépendance algérienne.\n\nUrbanisme\nGhardaïa est bâtie en pyramide sur une butte dominant la vallée du Mzab. La ville s'est développée à partir d'un noyau central, cœur de la cité, puis d'enceintes circulaires successives, le centre de la ville, Animas n ar’rem est le noyau le plus ancien. Sa configuration géométrique présente un plan concentrique dominé par la Grande mosquée.\nElle se distingue parmi les villes sahariennes du point de vue architectural, urbain et environnemental. L'urbanisation s'est établie par la reproduction du modèle du ksar avec la palmeraie. C'est également la ville la plus étendue du Mzab qui concentre les équipements et les infrastructures sociales, culturelles et économiques.\nLa ville s'est agrandie au fil des siècles et a occupé les parties basses de la butte. Au XXe siècle, cette croissance s'accélère et le modèle d'habitat oasien traditionnel est rompu. De nouvelles constructions sont ainsi établies à l'extérieur des remparts de ksar Ghardaïa et en direction de ksar Beni Isguen. Aujourd'hui, les extensions de la ville ont fini par rejoindre celles des autres cités de la Pentapole, l'urbanisation s'est étendue sur l'ensemble de la vallée au détriment des palmeraies, la Pentapole constitue désormais une vaste conurbation allongée sur 8 km. Et morphologiquement, la forme et l'architecture urbaines se diversifient. Seule El Atteuf, située à l'aval, reste un peu isolée.\n\nEn effet, à partir des années 1950, la vallée  a commencé à connaître un étalement urbain dû à l'accroissement de la population d'une part et à une migration de populations d'autres régions. L'espace situé entre les ksours de Ghardaïa, Melika et Beni-Isguen a été urbanisé entre 1950 et 1980. Quand Ghardaïa a été élevée au rang de chef-lieu de wilaya en 1985, ceci a largement accéléré le mouvement migratoire, accentue par les investissements publics de l'État algérien en projets d'infrastructures publiques comme les cités d'habitation, d'équipements publics, la canalisation de l'oued et la construction d'ouvrages d'arts .\nL'agglomération actuelle s'étend sur quatre communes : Dhayet Bendhahoua, Ghardaia, Bounoura et El Atteuf. Elle correspond spatialement à huit fois le périmètre bâti des cinq ksour originels de la pentapole sur un corridor urbanisé d'environ 25 km.\nÀ partir des années 1990, la vallée est saturée, l'étalement urbain se poursuit désormais sur  les plateaux, cela se traduit par le développement de lotissements privés, ainsi que la construction de la zone industrielle et de l'Université de Ghardaïa. Toutefois, ce nouvel étalement, soulève de nombreux problèmes d'aménagement et de gestion urbaine du fait de la contrainte topographique.\n\nÉconomie\nGhardaïa est une ville commerciale et industrielle dynamique dans le Sahara algérien, elle consiste une plaque tournante des échanges aériens, et du tourisme, grâce à ses infrastructures : hôtels et aéroport. En 1970, une zone  industrielle a été implémentée à Bounoura. Mais c'est Ghardaïa qui offre la palette la plus large d'industries, dont l'essor a démarré au début des années 1980.\nEn 2006, le secteur industriel rassemblait 55 entreprises réparties dans les trois zones industrielles de la wilaya : Ghardaïa, Bounoura, et Bouhaoua et la production s'articule autour des matériaux de construction. La wilaya de Ghardaïa présente notamment une forte concentration de l'industrie textile et qui constitue une des spécialités de la région, cette industrie du fait de sa production importante, représente l'essentiel du marché national. Le secteur est assez largement diversifié, la force et la densité des réseaux mozabites étendus à l'ensemble du territoire national, comme les capacités d'investissements induites par ces réseaux expliquent en partie le dynamisme de ce secteur.\n\nCulture\nGhardaïa abrite le musée folklorique du Mzab, il est situé dans les remparts extérieurs de la ville basse. Une maison traditionnelle y a été reconstituée.\nChaque année depuis plus d'un demi-siècle, durant le printemps, Ghardaïa fête le tapis, un événement d'ampleur nationale, cette exposition valorise l'artisanat traditionnel, notamment le tapis de laine pure, issu des différentes régions du pays. Le tapis typique de la région est fait à base de laine et de poil de chèvre. Il est tissé sur une trame très fine de style  géométrique à dominante rouge, noire et ocre.\nLa ville abrite également un institut islamique de rite ibadite d'une importance mondiale.\n\nPatrimoine\nLa vieille ville de Ghardaïa et le reste de la vallée du Mzab, sont classés au patrimoine mondial de l'humanité par l'UNESCO depuis 1982. La cité, du fait de son importance et de ses fonctions : marchés, medersa, connaissait un fonctionnement, et un rayonnement, plus proches de ceux d'une médina, que d'un ksar villageois.\nLa grande Mosquée de Ghardaïa, avec son minaret en forme de tronc de pyramide très allongé, domine toute la cité. Celle-ci, située sur les flancs d'une éminence conique au milieu de l'oued M'Zab, développe l'étagement de ses maisons en un panorama. La ville possède d'autres mosquées et mausolées, notamment : la mosquée Sidi Bou Gdemma, le supposé fondateur de la ville située dans la basse ville, la mosquée Cheikh Baba-Ouljemma située au nord du ksar sur une colline dominant le cimetière, la mosquée Cheikh Baissa-Oualouane, entourée des deux côtés d'une large aire de prière maçonnée M'çalla, le mausolée Cheikh Ammi Saïd situé dans le cimetière du ksar, la mosquée sunnite Badr située dans le quartier de Theniet El Mekhzene (ville basse) ou encore le mausolée de Cheikh Sidi Aïssa situé dans le ksar de Melika.\nL'ancienne et la première place du marché appelée Rahba est située dans le ksar ; l'actuelle place du marché, fait partie de l'extension extérieure de la ville. Cette dernière a été fondée vers les années 1884, sa forme est rectangulaire et sa surface est d'environ 3 400 m2, elle est entourée d'une galerie d’arcades.\nLe ksar est entouré de plusieurs cimetières, qui demeurent les seuls espaces non touchés par les opérations d'extension, c'est dû à la tradition ibadite qui veut qu'un terrain ayant recueilli des morts est consacré à tout jamais. Près de la ville, se situe la grotte de Daya qui est très vénérée par les femmes mozabites.\n\nPersonnalités liées à Ghardaïa\nMokhtar Belmokhtar (1972-), djihadiste, y est né.\nKamel Eddine Fekhar (1963-2019), militant politique, y est né.\nMoufdi Zakaria (1908–1977), poète algérien, né à Beni Isguen(Ghardaïa).

Its collection of desert fortress-cities is exotic to the point of surrealism.\n\n## Understand\nThe M'Zab Valley is a deep, desert valley dotted with five walled cities from the 11th century. Although each one is independent of the other, Ghardaïa is often used to refer to all five collectively. Each town sits on top of a rocky outcrop, with the surrounding sandstone houses leading up to a tall minaret that doubled as a watchtower. The architecture of the cities is of a Libyan-Berber style. The old town centres often contain large, fortress-like mosques and public buildings, with narrow lanes weaving down the hill to the walls. These cities sit within an oasis filled with palm and fruit trees, where locals would traditionally dwell in the hot summer. The locals have retained much of their tradition and customs, and travellers will be able to recognise this while visiting the area.\n\n## Cities\nM'zab is made up of five separate \"cities,\" which essentially serve as separate urban centers of one large \"Pentapolis,\" home to over 350,000 people.\nBeni Isguen\nBounoura\nEl-Ateuf\nGhardaïa — the largest city of the valley, with a population over 100,000.\nMelika — a small and less remarkable center, but one that offers the best views of both Ghardaia and Bounoura.\nOutside the Pentapolis of the valley, there are two other Mozabite oasis towns far to the north:\nGuerrara\nBérianne\n\n## Get in\nIt is possible to fly into Ghardaia from Algiers as Air Algerie has a few flights every week.

Now in ruins, in the 11th century, it served as the first capital of the Hammadid dynasty. It is in the Hodna Mountains northeast of M'Sila, at an elevation of 1,418 metres (4,652 ft), and receives abundant water from the surrounding mountains. The site is near the town of Maadid (aka Maadhid), about 225 kilometres (140 mi) southeast of Algiers, in the Maghreb.\nIn 1980, it was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO under the name Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad, and described as \"an authentic picture of a fortified Muslim city\".\nThe town includes a 7-kilometre (4 mi) long line of walls. Inside the walls are four residential complexes, and the largest mosque built in Algeria after that of Mansurah. It is similar in design to the Grand Mosque of Kairouan, with a tall minaret, 20 metres (66 ft).\nExcavations have brought to light numerous terracotta, jewels, coins and ceramics testifying to the high level of civilization under the Hammadid dynasty.  Also among the artifacts discovered are several decorative fountains using the lion as a motif. The remains of the emir's palace, known as Dar al-Bahr, include three separate residences separated by gardens and pavilions.\n\nHistory\nThe fortress was built in 1007 by Hammad ibn Buluggin, the son of Buluggin ibn Ziri, and the founder of Algiers. The city became the capital of the Hammadid Berbers, and sustained a siege from the Zirid in 1017. In 1090, it was abandoned under the menace of the Banu Hilal, and was partly destroyed by the Almohads in 1152.\nThe Qalaa was described by Al-Bakri in the 11th century as a large and powerful military stronghold and a centre of commerce that attracted caravans from all over the Maghreb, Iraq, Syria, Egypt and the Hejaz. Ibn Khaldun also noted that the abundance of travellers was due to the wealth of resources offered to those interested in sciences, commerce and arts. The Qala attracted poets, sages and theologians. The architecture of the Hammadids even influenced that of the Normans. \nExcavations began in 1908, resumed from 1952-1956 and continue to this day as most of the site remains unexplored and the aspects of the palaces await further study.\n\nArchitecture\nOverview\nThe Qalaa was described by Al-Bakri in the 11th century as a large and powerful military stronghold and a centre of commerce that attracted caravans from all over the Maghreb, Iraq, Syria, Egypt and the Hejaz. Ibn Khaldun also noted that the abundance of travellers was due to the wealth of resources offered to those interested in sciences, commerce and arts. The Qala attracted poets, sages and theologians. The architecture of the Hammadids even influenced that of the Normans.\n\nPalaces\nHammadid emirs constructed five palaces, most of which are now destroyed. The keep of the Palace of the Fanal (Qasr al-Manar) does survive. The upper palace consists of three buildings arranged around an irregularly shaped forecourt: a private apartment, a domed hall and an entrance wing.\nOther palaces such as the Qasr al-Kawab and Qasr al-Salam were constructed by the Hammadids. The Qasr al-Salam likely served as the residence of the ruler's family, and this structure summarises many aspects of typical Hammadid architecture. The Qasr al-Manar is another palace, its layout has resemblance to the Upper palace and Qasr al-Salam as its main elements are composed of a forecourt with an audience hall and a private apartment both surrounded with T-shaped pillared porticos.\n\nDar al-Bahr, the Lake Palace\nThe Dar al-Bahar (or Qsar al-Bahr) which is located nearby the congregational mosque was most likely used for public audiences and/or the palace of the Emir. The eastern court occupied by a large water basin inspired the name of the palace. Located between two courtyards is the main reception room, and a domed hall is located north of the water court. The outer walls consist of buttresses varying in design. As for the water courtyard, the court is 71 meters long and 51 meters wide while the basin is 68 meters long, 48 meters wide and 1.3 meters deep. The courtyard was surrounded on all sides by T-shaped pillared porticos.\nThe Dar al-Bahr palace was named for its rectangular pool, which measured 67 by 47 metres (220 by 154 ft). A ramp at one end of the pool was used to launch boats.  References to nautical displays in this pool appear in the accounts of contemporary visitors. The pool was surrounded by a portico, and accessed through a monumental entrance on the east side. West of the pool was an elevated terrace and courtyard with gardens. Outside the walls of the palace complex, gardens extended east-to-west across the city, and to a depth of nearly 100 metres (330 ft). The gardens have not yet been explored by archeologists, although ornamental fountains have been discovered.\n\nMosque\nThe Hammadid mosque is said to have been the largest mosque constructed in North Africa prior to the twentieth century and it features the typical Maghreb style square minaret. In Qal'at Beni Hammad, the minaret, 82 feet (25 m) in height, is the only remaining part of the ruined Great Mosque; the structure bears some resemblance to Seville's Giralda.\n\nDecoration\nArchitecture in Qalaat Beni Hammad featured adornments of \"porcelain mosaics of many-colored faience, sculpted panels and plaster, enameled terra-cotta stalactites; building and pottery ornamentation consisted of geometric designs and stylized floral motifs.\"\nIn the Qal’at Beni Hammad fragments of stucco were discovered from the Qasr al-Salam and the Qasr al-Manar which may be the oldest fragments of muqarnas in the Western Islamic world, dating back to the 11th or 12th century. There are no earlier examples of muqarnas in the Islamic West. According to Lucien Golvin the fragments of the muqarnas semi-dome at the Qasr al-Salam are the oldest documented remains of a true muqarnas vault in the Islamic world. However, other scholars of Islamic architecture have questioned or rejected the dating of these fragments or their identification as true muqarnas.\nFurthermore, the Qal’at buildings are considered to be documented antecedents and precursors to certain developments in Western Islamic art in the 12th century. Plaster capitals that were found at the Qal’at were composed of smooth leaves recurved in their upper part are considered to be an antecedent to the common Almoravid and Almohad forms which are seen in the Great Mosque of Tlemcen or in Tinmel. The framework of a marble basin and a grey marble fragment document the use of multifoil arches with spiral-form impost decoration. The use of this motif at the Qal’at subsequently spread during the times of the Almoravids and became universal in Almohad buildings. The square rooms surrounded by rampant barrel vaults in the Qasr al-Manar have been compared to the Almohad minarets and the Torre Pisana in Palermo which it predates. The Hammadid palaces are also noted to contain the first or one of the first documented use of shadirwan.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nUNESCO Site for Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad\nSite plan\nImages of Qal'at Bani Hammad (Kalaa Beni Hammad) in Manar al-Athar digital heritage photo archive",

          "content": "Tassili n'Ajjer (Berber: Tassili n Ajjer, Arabic: طاسيلي ناجر, romanized: ṭāssīlī naʾjir; \"Plateau of rivers\") is a mountain range in the Sahara desert, located in south-eastern Algeria. It holds one of the most important groupings of prehistoric cave art in the world and covers an area of more than 72,000 km2 (28,000 sq mi).\nThe site has been designated a national park and a Biosphere Reserve, and was inducted into the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 1982.\nThe literal English translation of Tassili n'Ajjer is 'plateau of rivers'.\n\nGeography\nTassili n'Ajjer is a plateau in south-eastern Algeria at the borders of Libya and Niger, covering an area of 72,000 km2. It ranges from 26°20′N 5°00′E east-south-east to 24°00′N 10°00′E. Its highest point is the Adrar Afao that peaks at 2,158 m (7,080 ft), located at 25°10′N 8°11′E. The nearest towns are Djanet on the southeastern edge and Illizi on the northern edge.\nThe plateau is of great geological and aesthetic interest. Its panorama of geological formations of rock forests, composed of eroded sandstone, resembles a lunar landscape and hosts a range of rock art styles.\n\nGeology\nThe range is composed largely of sandstone. The sandstone is stained by desert varnish, a thin outer layer of deposited metallic oxides that colour the rock formations variously from near-black to dull red. Erosion in the area has resulted in nearly 300 natural rock arches being formed in the south east, along with deep gorges and permanent water pools in the north.\n\nThe Tuareg Shield, an accumulation of terranes that formed during the Neoproterozoic era between 750 and 550 million years ago, encompassed the area of today's Ahaggar Mountains in Algeria, the Aïr Mountains in Niger, and the Adrar des Ifoghas in Mali. To the west lies the West African Craton, to the east the Saharan Metacraton. It expanded through accretion in the north and south, so that it also encompassed the area of today's Tassili n'Ajjer. During this epoch, the supercontinent Gondwana formed, which also included all the cratons and shields of what would later become Africa.\nDuring the subsequent Cambrian period (541 to 485 million years ago), the first sediment deposits still present today were formed in the Tassili n'Ajjer region. During this epoch, Gondwana shifted from the equatorial zone to the southern hemisphere, so that the Sahara region was located in the South Pole region during the Upper Ordovician (458 to 443 million years ago). At the end of this period, the 'Hirnantian’ ice age prevailed for a million years. An ice sheet formed, covering much of the northern half of Africa.\nIn the early Silurian period (starting 443 million years ago), the global climate changed, causing the ice of the Tuareg Shield to melt. This left behind meltwater channels that had formed under the ice. This completed the formation of the geological stratigraphy of the Inner Tassili Group. It consists mainly of sandstone and some layers of clay.\n\nDuring the Silurian and Devonian periods, transgression (the advance of the sea) from the north and northwest covered large areas of the Sahara with further layers of sediment. At that time, the Tassili n'Ajjer was the seabed near the coast, later becoming a fluvial floodplain. During the Silurian period, the stratigraphic sequence of the Intra Tassili Group was formed, which contains a lot of bioturbated clay and some sandstone. During the Devonian period, the formations of the External Tassili Group were formed, which contain a lot of sandstone alongside clays with macrofauna and some limestone. It is primarily from these two stratigraphic sequences of the Silurian and Devonian periods that petroleum and natural gas have been and continue to be extracted in the Illizi Basin, north of Illizi.\nDuring the following 200 million years, this region remained geologically a rather quiet, fairly flat mainland area without major tectonic changes or sedimentation. - Probably as early as the Cretaceous period, but especially since the Miocene (23 to 5,3 million years ago), the Tuareg Shield began to arch as a result of magmatic uplift. The uplift in the Ahaggar region ultimately reached 4,000 to 5,000 m. The Tassili n'Ajjer region was also affected, and the uplift caused its layers to tilt toward the north. Parallel to the uplift, several basins formed north and south of the Tuareg Shield, which now served as deposition areas for the eroded sediment, for example the Illizi Basin. Especially in the Miocene, the sedimentary layers of the External Tassili (the uppermost layer sequence) were completely eroded in the southern and eastern parts of the Tassili n'Ajjer. In the northern part, on the plateau of this layer group, the river systems dug up to 400 m deep into the sandstone and clay layers due to the now greater gradient.\nThe last major geological change occurred during the Pliocene (5,3 to 2,58 million years ago). Volcanism covered the Adrar region in southwestern Tassili n'Ajjer with craters, volcanic cones, and lava flows. This development continued into the early Quaternary period.\n\nEcology\nTassili n'Ajjer lies within the West Saharan montane xeric woodlands ecoregion. Due to the higher elevation of the area, coupled with the water-retentive properties of the sandstone, the vegetation here is somewhat more lush and verdant than in the lower regions of desert; in turn, this creates an attractive habitat for numerous animal species, from the smallest invertebrates, up the food chain to mammals. The park features an open woodland, primarily consisting of the endangered and endemic Saharan cypress and Saharan myrtle, in its higher-elevation eastern half. The Tassili cypress is one of the longest-living trees and organisms on Earth, after the bristlecone pines of the Western US.\nAn isolated population of the West African crocodile survived in Tassili n'Ajjer until the twentieth century; today, the species is primarily found in more tropical and sub-Saharan regions of Western and Central Africa, from Senegal to Chad. The aoudad, or Barbary sheep, is the only extant species of animal depicted in the area's ancient rock artwork.\nThe park has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of spotted, crowned and Lichtenstein's sandgrouse, Pharaoh eagle-owls, greater hoopoe-larks, bar-tailed and desert larks, pale rock martins, fulvous babblers, white-crowned and mourning wheatears, desert sparrows and trumpeter finches.\n\nArchaeology\nBackground\nAlgerian rock art has been subject to European study since 1863, with surveys conducted by \"A. Pomel (1893–1898), Stéphane Gsell (1901–1927), G. B. M. Flamand (1892–1921), Leo Frobenius and Hugo Obermaier (1925), Henri Breuil (1931–1957), L. Joleaud (1918–1938), and Raymond Vaufrey (1935–1955).\"\nTassili was already well known by the early 20th century, but Westerners were broadly introduced to it through a series of sketches made by French legionnaires, particularly Lieutenant Charles Brenans in the 1930s. He brought with him French archaeologist Henri Lhote, who would later return during 1956–1957, 1959, 1962, and 1970. Lhote's expeditions have been heavily criticized, with his team accused of faking images and of damaging paintings in brightening them for tracing and photography, which resulted in reducing the original colors beyond repair.\n\nCurrent archaeological interpretation\nThe site of Tassili was primarily occupied during the Neolithic period by transhumant pastoralist groups whose lifestyle benefited both humans and livestock. The local geography, elevation, and natural resources were optimal conditions for dry-season camping of small groups. The wadis within the mountain range functioned as corridors between the rocky highlands and the sandy lowlands. The highlands have archaeological evidence of occupation dating from 5500 to 1500 BCE, while the lowlands have stone tumuli and hearths dating between 6000 and 4000 BCE. The lowland locations appear to have been used as living sites, specifically during the rainy season. There are numerous rock shelters within the sandstone forests, strewn with Neolithic artifacts including ceramic pots and potsherds, lithic arrowheads, bowls and grinders, beads, and jewelry.\nThe transition to pastoralism following the African Humid period during the early Holocene is reflected in Tassili n'Ajjer's archaeological material record, rock art, and zooarchaeology. Further, the occupation of Tassili is part of a larger movement and climate shift within the Central Sahara. Paleoclimatic and paleoenvironment studies started in the Central Sahara around 14,000 BP and then proceeded by an arid period that resulted in narrow ecological niches. However, the climate was not consistent and the Sahara was split between the arid lowlands and the humid highlands. Archaeological excavations confirm that human occupation, in the form of hunter-gather groups, occurred between 10,000 and 7500 BP; following 7500 BP, humans began to organize into pastoral groups in response to the increasingly unpredictable climate. There was a dry period from 7900 and 7200 BP in Tassili that preceded the appearance of the first pastoral groups, which is consistent with other parts of the Saharan-Sahelian belt. The pre-Pastoral pottery excavated from Tassili dates around 9,000–8,500 BP, while the Pastoral pottery is from 7100–6000 BP.\nThe rock art at Tassili is used in conjunction with other sites, including Dhar Tichitt in Mauritania, to study the development of animal husbandry and trans-Saharan travel in North Africa. Cattle were herded across vast areas as early as 3000–2000 BCE, reflecting the origins and spread of pastoralism in the area. This was followed by horses (before 1000 BCE) and then the camel in the next millennium. The arrival of camels reflects the increased development of trans-Saharan trade, as camels were primarily used as transport in trade caravans.\n\nPrehistoric art\nThe rock formation is an archaeological site, noted for its numerous prehistoric parietal works of rock art, first reported in 1910, that date to the early Neolithic era at the end of the last glacial period during which the Sahara was a habitable savanna rather than the current desert. Although sources vary considerably, the earliest pieces of art are presumed to be 12,000 years old. The vast majority date to the ninth and tenth millennia BP or younger, according to OSL dating of associated sediments. The art was dated by gathering small fragments of the painted panels that had dried out and flaked off before being buried. Among the 15,000 engravings so far identified, the subjects depicted are large wild animals including antelopes and crocodiles, cattle herds, and humans who engage in activities such as hunting and dancing.  These paintings are some of the earliest by Central Saharan artists, and occur in the largest concentration at Tassili. Although Algeria is relatively close to the Iberian Peninsula, the rock art of Tassili n'Ajjer evolved separately from that of the European tradition. According to UNESCO, \"The exceptional density of paintings and engravings...have made Tassili world famous.\"\nSimilar to other Saharan sites with rock art, Tassili can be separated into five distinct traditions: Archaic (10,000 to 7500 BCE), Round Head (7550 to 5050 BCE), Bovidian or Pastoral (4500 to 4000 BCE), Horse (from 2000 BCE and 50 CE), and Camel (1000 BCE and onward).\nThe Archaic period consists primarily of wild animals that lived in the Sahara during the Early Holocene. These works are attributed to hunter-gather peoples, consisting of only etchings. Images are primarily of larger animals, depicted in a naturalistic manner, with the occasional geometric pattern and the human figure. Usually, the humans and animals are depicted within the context of a hunting scene.\nThe Round Head Period is associated with specific stylistic choices depicting humanoid forms and is well separated from the Archaic tradition even though hunter-gatherers were the artists for both. The art consists mainly of paintings, with some of the oldest and largest exposed rock paintings in Africa; one human figure stands over five meters and another at three and a half meters. The unique depiction of floating figures with round, featureless heads and formless bodies appear to be floating on the rock surface, hence the \"Round Head\" label. The occurrence of these paintings and motifs are concentrated in specific locations on the plateau, implying that these sites were the center of ritual, rites, and ceremonies. Most animals shown are mouflon and antelope, usually in static positions that do not appear to be part of a hunting scene.\nThe Bovidian/Pastoral period correlates with the arrival of domesticated cattle into the Sahara and the gradual shift to mobile pastoralism. There is a notable and visual difference between the Pastoral period and the earlier two periods, coinciding with the aridification of the Sahara. There is increased stylistic variation, implying the movement of different cultural groups within the area. Domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and dogs are depicted, paralleling the zooarchaeological record of the area. The scenes reference diversified communities of herders, hunters with bows, as well as women and children, and imply a growing stratification of society based on property.\nThe following Horse traditions correspond with the complete desertification of the Sahara and the requirement for new travel methods. The arrival of horses, horse-drawn chariots, and riders are depicted, often in mid-gallop, and is associated more with hunting than warfare. Inscriptions of Libyan-Berber script, used by ancestral Berber peoples, appear next to the images, however, the text is completely indecipherable.\nThe last period is defined by the appearance of camels, which replaced donkeys and cattle as the main mode of transportation across the Sahara. The arrival of camels coincides with the development of long-distance trade routes used by caravans to transport salt, goods, and enslaved people across the Sahara. Men, both mounted and unmounted, with shields, spears, and swords are present. Animals including cows and goats are included, but wild animals were crudely rendered.\nAlthough these periods are successive the timeframes are flexible and are consistently being reconstructed by archaeologists as technology and interpretation develop. The art had been dated by archaeologists who gathered fallen fragments and debris from the rock face.\n\nA notable piece common in academic writing is the \"Running Horned Woman,\" also known as the \"Horned Goddess,\" from the round head period. The image depicts a female figure with horns in midstride; dots adorn her torso and limbs, and she is dressed in fringed armbands, a skirt, leg bands, and anklets. According to Arisika Razak, Tassili's Horned Goddess is an early example of the \"African Sacred Feminine.\" Her femininity, fertility, and connection to nature are emphasized while the Neolithic artist superimposes the figure onto smaller, older figures. The use of bull horns is a common theme in later round head paintings, which reflects the steady integration of domesticated cattle into Saharan daily life. Cattle imagery, specifically that of bulls,  became a central theme in not only at Tassili, but at other nearby sites in Libya.\n\nFungoid rock art\nIn 1989, the psychedelics researcher Giorgio Samorini proposed the theory that the fungoid-like paintings in the caves of Tassili are proof of the relationship between humans and psychedelics in the ancient populations of the Sahara, when it was still a verdant land:\n\nOne of the most important scenes is to be found in the Tin-Tazarift rock art site, at Tassili, in which we find a series of masked figures in line and hieratically dressed or dressed as dancers surrounded by long and lively festoons of geometrical designs of different kinds... Each dancer holds a mushroom-like object in the right hand and, even more surprising, two parallel lines come out of this object to reach the central part of the head of the dancer, the area of the roots of the two horns. This double line could signify an indirect association or non-material fluid passing from the object held in the right hand and the mind. This interpretation would coincide with the mushroom interpretation if we bear in mind the universal mental value induced by hallucinogenic mushrooms and vegetals, which is often of a mystical and spiritual nature (Dobkin de Rios, 1984:194). It would seem that these lines – in themselves an ideogram that represents something non-material in ancient art – represent the effect that the mushroom has on the human mind... In a shelter in Tin – Abouteka, in Tassili, there is a motif appearing at least twice that associates mushrooms and fish; a unique association of symbols among ethno-mycological cultures... Two mushrooms are depicted opposite each other, in a perpendicular position about the fish motif and near the tail. Not far from here, above, we find other fish which are similar to the aforementioned, but without the side-mushrooms.\nThis theory was reused by Terence McKenna in his 1992 book Food of the Gods, hypothesizing that the Neolithic culture that inhabited the site used psilocybin mushrooms as part of its religious ritual life, citing rock paintings showing persons holding mushroom-like objects in their hands, as well as mushrooms growing from their bodies. For Henri Lhote, who discovered the Tassili caves in the late 1950s, these were obviously secret sanctuaries.\nThe painting that best supports the mushroom hypothesis is the Tassili mushroom figure Matalem-Amazar where the body of the represented shaman is covered with mushrooms. According to Earl Lee in his book From the Bodies of the Gods: Psychoactive Plants and the Cults of the Dead (2012), this imagery refers to an ancient episode where a \"mushroom shaman\" was buried while fully clothed and when unearthed sometime later, tiny mushrooms would be growing on the clothes. Earl Lee considered the mushroom paintings at Tassili fairly realistic.\nAccording to Brian Akers, writer for the Mushroom journal, the fungoid rock art in Tassili does not resemble the representations of the Psilocybe hispanica in the Selva Pascuala caves (2015), and he doesn't consider it realistic.\n\nIn popular culture\nTassili is the recording location and the title of a 2011 album by the Tuareg band Tinariwen.\nTassili Plain is a track on the 1994 album Natural Wonders of the World in Dub by dub group Zion Train.\nIn Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star, the character Altera is actually a shattered form of the deity known as Sefar, which is based on one of the drawings made in the cave group and is known in the story also as The White Titan of Tassili n'Ajjer\n\nGallery\nThe rock engravings of Tin-Taghirt\nThe Tin-Taghirt site is located in the Tassili n'Ajjer between the cities of Dider and Iherir.\n\nSee also\nList of Stone Age art\nList of cultural assets of Algeria\nSebiba\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nVideo\nThe natural arches of the Tassili n'Ajjer\nFlore et faune du Tassili n’Ajjer, 2023, French, illustrated.

وقليلاً على الأراضي الليبية. يوجد فيها واحدة من أهم التشكيلات للرسومات الكهفية لما قبل التاريخ في العالم.\n\nجغرافيا\nوهي هضبة قاحلة حصوية ترتفع بأكثر من 2000 م عن سطح البحر عرضها من 50 إلى 60 كم وطولها 800 كم مشكلة مساحة تقدر72,000 كـم2 (28,000 ميل2)، أعلى قمة جبلية وهي أدرار أفاو ترتفع ب 2،158 م، ويظهر في المنحدرات العالية على ارتفاع 1500 متر في المتوسط فوق عروق مرزق وأوباري في الشرق وأدمر في تينيري في الجنوب. وإلى الشمال، تُفقد هذه الهضبة المرتفعة في كثبان إيساوان وبورهارت.\nعلى كل مساحتها ترتفع من على الرمال قمم صخرية متآكلة جدا تعرف بالغابات الصخرية وكأنها أطلال مدن قديمة مهجورة بفعل الزمن والعواصف الرملية.تتخللها فتحات في الجرف - التي لا يمكن الوصول إليها إلا سيرًا على الأقدام أو الجمال - والعديد من التصدعات والأودية التي تؤوي في بعض الأحيان قلتات والتي تتغذى من العواصف الرعدية النادرة والعنيفة التي تجوب الصحراء كل سنتين أو ثلاث سنوات.\nيسكن المسيف الطوارق مجموعة كيل أجير. مدينتها الرئيسية هي جانت، واحة صغيرة على الحافة الغربية للمنطقة.\n\nالجيولوجيا\nيتكون الطاسيلي من الأحجار الرملية، التي تتشكل من الرواسب الرسوبية الكبيرة المتراكبة من الطمي الصلب والرمل الناتج عن التآكل الجزئي للجبال البلورية من حقبة الحياة القديمة (من -541 إلى -252.2 مليون سنة ) وترسبت من المحيطات أثناء حقبة الحياة الوسطى (من -252.2 إلى -66 ما) التي تغطي الصحراء الحالية بأكملها. بعد ذلك، دفعت القاعدة المكونة من الحجر الرملي الطبقي عند الأطراف بسبب ثوران كتلة الهقار. التغيرات المناخية والمائية القوية جرفت ونحتت وشكلت الصخرة قبل حوالي 4 ملايين سنة.\nنقسم منطقة الطاسيلي إلى 03 أقسام:\nالطاسيلي الداخلي: يعود تكوينه إلى العصر الأردوفيني، وهو واقع بين النجد المتبلور للهقار والمنطقة السفلية لسهول الطاسيلي.\nالطاسيلي الخارجي : يعود تاريخه ما بين العصر السيلوري والدوفيني الأسفل ، وهو يمتد بين الأخدود الداخلي للطاسيلي والمنطقة التي يقع فيها وادي إيغرغارن.\nالأخدود أسفل الطاسيلي : يعود تاريخه إلى العصر السيلوري حوالي 420 مليون سنة، وهو عبارة عن منخفض يقع في قاعدة الطاسيلي الداخلي وقاعدة الطاسيلي الخارجي وتصب فيه معظم أودية الطاسيلي الداخلي.\nمنذ ملايين السنين، جرفت المياه في التاسيلي التربة. ثم، عندما عمّ الجفاف، جاء دور الريح لنحت وصقل هذه الصخور الرخوة دون توقف. لا تزال الأمطار النادرة، حتى الأنهار الاستثنائية، كانت السبب في هذا التآكل الكبير، وذلك لأنه لا يوجد غطاء نباتي يحتفظ بالمياه التي تحفر الصخور. درجة الحرارة هي سبب آخر للتآكل. الفرق بين الليل والنهاريصل في بعض الأحيان الخمسين درجة. تنفجر الحجارة حرفيًا بسبب تأثير هذه الاختلالات الرهيبة في الحرارة حتى تصبح غبارًا رمليًا (الظاهرة تسمى التفلق الصخري أو التكسر الهلامي ).\nتتكون كهوف طاسيلي من مجموعة من تشكيلات الصخور البركانية والرملية الغريبة الشكل والتي تشبه الخرائب والأطلال، وتعرف باسم \"الغابات الحجرية\". وتوجد الكهوف فوق هضبة مرتفعة يجاورها جرف عميق في منطقة تتواجد بها نسبة كبيرة من الكثبان الرملية المتحركة. تحتوي جدران هذه الكهوف مجموعة من النقوش الغريبة التي تمثل حياة كاملة لحضارة قديمة. ومن تحليل هذه الصور اكتشف الخبراء أن تاريخها يعود إلي 20 ألف عام.\n\nالبيئة\nبسبب الارتفاع وخصائص الاحتفاظ بالمياه في باطن أرض طاسيلي ناجر فإن الغطاء النباتي في هذه الأرض القاحلة تعتبر ثرية إلى حد ما عن الصحراء المحيطة بها فهي تشمل تواجد الغابات المنتشرة منها أشجار السرو الصحراء المتوطنة المهددة بالانقراض حيث لم يبقَ منها إلا حوالي 230 شجرة محصية، عمر كل واحدة يتعدى 2000 سنة، و ميرتل الصحراء في النصف الشرقي من أعلى النطاق.\nبيئة طاسيلي ناجر مصنفة في ملحق الشجيرات الغابات الجبلية للصحراء الغربية.\n\nالحقب التاريخية\nخلال الفترة الرطبة من العصر الحجري الحديث (ما بين 9000 و 2500 قبل الميلاد)، كانت الصحراء الكبرى مكسوة بالعشب وتصلح لأن يستوطنها البشر والحيوان مثل النعام والزرافات والفيلة والظباء. كما ساعدت وفرة المياه وبعض البحيرات الكبيرة هناك على تشجيع حياة الأسماك والتماسيح وفرس النهر. فساعدت هذه الظروف المؤاتية صيادي البراري وفيما بعد الرعاة على بناء المخيمات والمساكن في مختلف هضاب وأراضي الصحراء المرتفعة الخصبة.\nوبحلول عام 2500 قبل الميلاد، أصبحت الصحراء، باستثناء نهر النيل، أرضا قاحلة فلم تعد تصلح أن يسكنها بني البشر. ولكن ذلك الماضي الخصب بقي من خلال الرسومات والنقوش التي تركها السكان مجسدة على الصخور عبر بقاع الصحراء. فعلى تلك الصخور أصبحت الرسومات الجميلة للأشكال البشرية تذكارا مرئيا لمعتقدات وممارسات سكان شمال أفريقيا الأقدمون خلال فترات تكيفهم مع بيئتهم المتغيرة واكتسابهم لأدوات وعادات جديدة.\nفأكثر من نصف الفنون المنقوشة على الصخور الصحراوية توجد في منطقة طاسيلي ناجر (\"سهل الوديان العديدة\" بلغة الطوارق) جنوب شرق الجزائر. وتوجد مواقع أخرى في الصحراء الليبية وشمال النيجر. فقد تم التعرف على أزيد من 30 ألف موقع إلى حد الآن.\nوأصبح تحديد تاريخ تلك الرسومات والنقوش موضع نقاش ساخن بين العلماء رغم أنهم يتفقون عموما على أنه يمكن تقسيم تلك الحقبة إلى أربع حقب رئيسية متتالية بناء على أسلوب ومحتوى الرسومات:\n\nالحقبة البائدة أو البابلسية (مرحلة الصيد البري قبل 5000 قبل الميلاد):\nتُجسد النقوش المحاكية للطبيعة على الأحجار ذات الأشكال الضخمة الحيوانات التي تعرضت للانقراض في تلك الحقبة بما فيها البقر الوحشي والفيلة ووحيدي القرن والزرافات والظباء وفرس النهر. ويكاد لا يكون هناك أي تجسيد للحيوانات الأليفة مما قد يعني أن السكان آنذاك قد اعتاشوا بصيد الحيوانات الضخمة. وتظهر أشكال الرجال وهم مسلحون بالعصي والرماح والفؤوس والأقواس. وتتمثل أحسن النماذج عن هذه الحقبة في نقوشات وادي دجيرات في طاسيلي الناجر، والزرافات في منطقة أير بالنيجر وبعض النقوش في منطقة المساك اليبية.\n\nالحقبة البوفيدية (رعاة القطعان) 4500 إلى 2500 قبل الميلاد:\nتوافق هذه الحقبة وصول القطعان إلى شمال أفريقيا ما بين 4500 و 4000 قبل الميلاد. إذ أن غالبية النقوش والرسومات تعود إلى هذه الحقبة. وتبين بعض المشاهد أشخاصا وهم منهمكون في قضاء أعمالهم اليومية بينما تجسد نماذج أخرى قطعان الحيوانات المولفة والأغنام والماعز وأحيانا تبين الرعاة بقرب قطعانهم. هذه الرسومات لها سحنة أكثر جمالا بفضل استخدام اللون الصلصالي الأحمر والصبغات البيضاء. ويعتقد أن الرسامين كانوا من الرعاة الرحل يشبه أسلوبه معيشتهم قبائل النوبة اليوم في السودان والقبائل الفولانية في النيجر. وتوجد غالبية الرسومات البوفيدية في طاسيلي وجبال أكاكوس في ليبيا.\n\nحقبة الخيول (حوالي 1200 قبل الميلاد):\nتجسد الرسومات من هذه الحقبة بشرا مسلحين بأسلحة صغيرة وعربات تجرها الخيول. ويعتقد أن الحصان كان قد بدأ استخدامه في الصحراء حوال 1200 قبل الميلاد. كما تعتبر جودة هذه الرسومات هزيلة بالمقارنة مع الحقبة السابقة حيث تبدو أشكال البشر أقل حجما وتتخذ شكل ساعات رملية.\n\nحقبة الجمال (1200 قبل الميلاد):\nبحلول هذا التاريخ، تمت عملية التصحر في شمال أفريقيا فاستعيض عن الحصان بالجمل \"صديق الصحراء\" في فن الرسم على الصخور وفي حياة الناس.\nخضعت عملية تقسيم تاريخ شمال أفريقيا هذه للتمحيص من قبل العلماء الذين يتساءلون عن مدى مصداقية التسلسل الزمني على صعيد الصحراء ككل. حيث يعيق حجم الصحراء الهائل والتعقيدات السياسية في المنطقة إجراء دراسة أكثر خصوصية تركز على التنوع الإقليمي. ولهذا يبقى فن النقش على الصخور عموما مجالا ينقصه البحث وبذلك غير مفهوم بشكل جيد.\nكانت الصحراء الغربية لشمال أفريقيا مصبا لنهر النيل قبل عشرات آلاف السنين كما يقول بعض العلماء مستدلين على الكمية الهائلة من المياه الجوفية والبحيرات المتواجدة بها.\n\nفن ماقبل التاريخ\nتم العثور على تحف فنية من أشكال لحيوانات في نطاق الطاسيلي ويلاحظ أيضا لوحات ما قبل التاريخ في الصخور وغيرها من المواقع الأثرية القديمة، التي يرجع تاريخها إلى العصر الحجري الحديث عندما كان المناخ المحلي رطب بكثير مع تواجد السافانا بدلا من الصحراء.وتتنوع الصور الموجودة بين صور لعمليات رعي الأبقار وسط مروج ضخمة، وصور لخيول، ونقوش لانهار وحدائق غناء،وحيوانات برية، ومراسم دينية، وبعض الآلهة القديمة.\nوقد كان الوصول إلي اكتشاف هذه الكهوف صعبا ومتأخرا، نتيجة لوقوعها في قلب منطقة \"جبارين\" حيث الصحراء قاحلة والمناخ شديد الحرارة. يسكن السلسلة الجبلية فرع من الطوارق وهم كل الأجر يتمركزون في عاصمة الطاسيلي جانت\n\nتصنيف اليونيسكو\nفي 1982 أدخلت اليونسكو الموقع في قائمة التراث العالمي وفي 1986 محمية الإنسان والبيوسفير حيوانات نادرة في طريق الانقراض وجدت ملاذا في المنطقة كاللأروية (الضأن البربري) وأنواع عديدة من الغزال والفهود وحيوانات أخرى.\nوبعد أن صنفتها اليونيسكو ضمن الإرث التاريخي الوطني في يوليو 1972، تم إدراج طاسيلي ناجر إرثا حضاريا عالميا سنة 1982 بفضل ثرواتها الثقافية ثم لقيت الاعتراف في شبكة برنامج اليونيسكو الإنسان والمجال الحيوي كمحمية إنسانية ومجال حيوي، في حين تم إدراج بحيرة إهرير سنة 2001 كمنطقة رطبة ذات أهمية عالمية ضمن لائحة معاهدة رامسار الدولية حول المناالطق الرطبة.\nيشكل الموقع أكبر متحف للرسوم الصخرية البدائة في كل الكرة الأرضية وقد تم إحصاء أكثر من 30،000 رسم تصف الطقوس الدينية والحياة اليومية لللإنسان الدي عاش في هذه المناطق أثناء حقبة ما قبل التاريخ. مما ينبهنا ويجعلنا نتخيل كيف كانت هذه المناطق القاحلة العقيمة تعج الخضرة والحياة.\n\nالنشاط السياحي\nبعد أن تم تصنيفها من طرف المسؤولين الجزائريين كحديقة وطنية محمية وتصنيفها من طرف اليونيسكو كإرث حضاري عالمي تم إعادة إحياء هيبتها العالمية وذلك بإدراجها في مختلف المزارات والمعارض السياحية العالمية وهي تعتبر مع جبال الهقار قلب توجه السياح المحليين والأجانب لما تمتلكه من مواقع تجذب السياح فهي تمتلك أكبر متحف للنقوش الحجرية عبر مناطقها بهضبة مداك (تامريت وسفار وجبرين)، كما يعتبر رواق واد جرات الموجود على الهواء الطلق الأكبر من نوعه في المعمورة وهو يمثل أجمل رواق للنقوش الصخرية في الجزائر بمحطاته ال75 التي تضم أزيد من 4.000 شكل تم جردها عبر مسافة تقدر بنحو 30 كم.وذلك دون احتساب باقي الرسومات الأخرى ومجموعها 30.000 شكل.\nوللحفاظ على محمية طاسيلي تم القيام بإجراءات تطبيقية لحماية السياح وعذرية الأثار كمرافقة مرشد رسمي لزوار الحديقة يحترم إجراءات الحماية التي وضعت منذ سنوات من طرف ديوان الحظيرة الوطنية للطاسيلي، ومسار الجولة يحدد بصفة مسبقة كما أن الزيارات تكون مرخصة وكل زائر يتوجب عليه الإمضاء على ميثاق حسن السلوك وذلك قبل الانطلاق في جولته حتى يضمن جولة سياحية في منطقة تحكي حكايتها النقوش الحجرية.\nيسمى هذا النوع من السياحة بسياحة المغامرة (Active vacation) التي تعتبر نوعا من الرياضة، وتقتصر على مجموعة من السياح المتدربين والمتمرسين. يمثل هذا المجال السياحي حولي 8٪ من سوق السياحة العالمية. مجموعة كبيرة من الجزائريين تعيش على هذه السياحة التي تعرف تدهورا بسبب الارهاب والسياسة السياحية الفاشلة.\n\nانظر أيضًا\nالمقابر الجنائزية ونقوش الطاوز

          "content": "Le tassili n’Ajjer (en berbère : tasili n Ajer, en tifinagh : ⵜⴰⵙⵉⵍⵉ ⵏ ⴰⵣⴶⵔ, Tasili n Azjer ; en arabe : طاسيلي ناجر) est un massif de montagnes situé au centre du Sahara, dans le Sud-Est de l'Algérie et dont la frange orientale se trouve en territoire libyen.\n\nGéographie\nSituation, topographie\nCe haut plateau aride se trouve à plus de 1 000 mètres d'altitude et s'étend sur 670 km du nord-ouest au sud-est et 200 km environ du nord-est au sud-ouest, soit une superficie de près de 72 000 km2. Sur toute sa surface se dressent des formations rocheuses créées par l'érosion, émergeant des dunes de sable, qui évoquent de loin les ruines de villes antiques. Illizi se trouve au pied du versant nord et Djanet en bordure du versant sud-ouest.\nLe tassili n’Ajjer culmine à 2 158 mètres d'altitude à l'Adrar Afao et émerge en hautes falaises à 1 500 mètres en moyenne au-dessus des ergs de Mourzouq et d'Oubari à l'est et d'Admer dans le Ténéré au sud. Au nord, ce haut plateau se perd dans les dunes d'Issaouane et de Bourharet.\nLe relief du tassili n’Ajjer est particulièrement tourmenté : les immenses plaines rocheuses qui laissent parfois la place à des « forêts » de monolithes sont creusées d’akbas (trous dans les escarpements qui ne sont accessibles qu'à pied ou à dos de dromadaire) et de multiples failles et canyons recelant parfois une guelta alimentée par les rares et violents orages qui ravinent le désert tous les deux ou trois ans.\nLe massif est habité par les Touaregs du groupe Kel Ajjer. Sa ville principale est Djanet, une petite oasis située en bordure occidentale de la région.\n\nGéologie\nLe bouclier touareg, un ensemble de terranes qui s'est formé au cours du Néoprotérozoïque, il y a 750 à 550 millions d'années, couvrait le territoire des montagnes actuelles de l'Hoggar en Algérie, de l'Aïr au Niger et de l'adrar des Ifoghas au Mali. À l'ouest se trouve le craton ouest-africain, à l'est le mégacraton saharien oriental. Il s'est agrandi par accrétion au nord et au sud, de sorte qu'il englobait également la région de l'actuel tassili n'Ajjer. Au cours de cette époque, le supercontinent Gondwana s'est formé, auquel appartenaient également tous les cratons et boucliers de l'Afrique ultérieure.\nAu cours du Cambrien qui a suivi (541 à 485  millions d'années), les premiers dépôts de sédiments encore présents aujourd'hui se sont formés dans la région du tassili n'Ajjer. Au cours de cette époque, le Gondwana s'est déplacé de la zone équatoriale vers l'hémisphère sud de la Terre, de sorte que la région du Sahara se trouvait dans la région du pôle Sud à l'Ordovicien supérieur (458 à 443 millions d'années). À la fin de cette époque, la glaciation hirnantienne a régné pendant un million d'années. Une calotte glaciaire s'est formée, recouvrant une grande partie de la moitié nord de l'Afrique. Dans la région à l'ouest de Ghat, dans le tassili n'Ajjer, des formations rocheuses plates présentant des marques d'abrasion témoignent du mouvement des glaces pendant cette période.\nAu début du Silurien (il y a 443 millions d'années), le climat mondial a changé, provoquant la fonte des glaces du bouclier touareg. Cela a laissé derrière lui des canaux d'eau de fonte qui s'étaient formés sous la glace. Cela a achevé la formation de la stratigraphie géologique du groupe des tassilis internes. Il se compose principalement de grès et de quelques couches d'argile.\n\nAu cours des périodes silurienne et dévonienne, la transgression (l'avancée de la mer) depuis le nord et le nord-ouest a recouvert de vastes zones du Sahara de nouvelles couches de sédiments. À cette époque, le tassili n'Ajjer était le fond marin près de la côte, avant de devenir une plaine inondable fluviale. Au cours du Silurien, la séquence stratigraphique du groupe de la dépression ou sillon intra-tassilien s'est formée, contenant beaucoup d'argile bioturbée et quelques fines couches de  grès. Au cours du Dévonien, les formations du groupe des tassilis externes se sont formées, contenant beaucoup de grès ainsi que de l'argile avec de la macrofaune et des couches de calcaire. Ce sont surtout ces deux séries stratigraphiques du Silurien et du Dévonien qui contiennent, dans le bassin d'Illizi au nord du tassili n'Ajjer, des gisements de pétrole et de gaz naturel qui sont exploités.\nPendant les 200 millions d'années qui ont suivi, cette région est restée géologiquement une zone continentale plutôt calme et assez plate, sans grands changements tectoniques ni sédimentations. Probablement dès le Crétacé, mais surtout depuis le Miocène (23 à 5,3 millions d'années), le bouclier touareg a commencé à se bomber sous l'effet d'une poussée magmatique. Le soulèvement dans la région de l'Ahaggar a finalement atteint 4 000 à5000 m. La région du tassili n'Ajjer a également été touchée, et le gonflement a provoqué une inclinaison de ses couches vers le nord. Parallèlement au soulèvement, plusieurs bassins se sont formés au nord et au sud du bouclier touareg, qui ont alors servi de zones de dépôt pour les sédiments érodés, par exemple le bassin d'Illizi. C'est surtout au Miocène que les couches sédimentaires du groupe des tassilis externes (la série de couches supérieure) ont été complètement érodées dans les parties sud et est du massif.\nLe dernier changement géologique majeur s'est produit au Pléistocène (il y a 5,3 à 2,58 millions d'années). Le volcanisme a recouvert la région de l'Adrar, au sud-ouest du tassili n'Ajjer, de cratères, de cônes volcaniques et de coulées de lave. Cette évolution s'est poursuivie jusqu'au début du Quaternaire.\nDans la partie nord, sur le plateau du Groupe des Tassilis externes, les systèmes fluviaux se sont enfoncés jusqu'à 400 m de profondeur dans les couches de grès et d'argile en raison de la pente désormais plus grande. Mais pendant les périodes de sécheresse des époques passées et même aujourd'hui les vents chargés de grains de sable usèrent et sculptèrent les grès meubles. Les rares pluies, les exceptionnelles crues, demeurent une cause d'érosion importante, car nul couvert végétal ne retient les eaux qui creusent les roches. Les températures sont une autre cause de l'érosion : la différence entre la nuit et le jour est parfois de cinquante degrés et les roches éclatent littéralement par l'effet de ces variations brutales jusqu'à devenir poussière de sable (phénomène appellé cryoclastie ou gélifraction).\n\nFaune et flore\nEntre 17 000 et 12 000 ans avant le présent, le tassili n’Ajjer était recouvert d'une végétation verdoyante, qui évolua progressivement vers la savane, puis la steppe de type sahelien, avant de devenir un désert il y a 7 000 ans avant le présent. Il en demeure quelques espèces-reliques comme des myrtes à proximité des trous d'eau et des cyprès du Tassili (tarout) dont il subsiste une centaine de spécimens près de Tamrit. De cette époque subsistent également le mouflon à manchettes et quelques survivants d'une faune aquatique jadis variée : des poissons dans certaines gueltas, des crevettes dans l'oasis de Djanet et même des crocodiles, découverts en 1924 : les crocodiles de l'Imhirou.\n\nHistoire\nLe tassili n'Ajjer est englobé avec l'erg Admer et la Tadrart Rouge dans le parc culturel du Tassili (138 000 km2) lors de sa création le 27 juillet 1972. Le parc est inscrit depuis 1982 sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO et classé réserve de biosphère depuis 1986. Des animaux en voie de disparition tels que le mouflon et des gazelles y ont trouvé refuge.\nLe tassili n'Ajjer et son parc culturel sont considérés comme l'un des plus grands et anciens « musées rupestres à ciel ouvert » du monde, au même titre que les fresques des aborigènes d'Australie ou des khoïsan de Namibie. Il abrite notamment les gravures rupestres de l'Oued Djerat et celles du plateau de Sefar datant d'environ 9 à 10 000 ans avant le présent, rappelant qu'à l'époque où le Sahara était verdoyant et fertile, des populations de chasseurs et de pasteurs y vivaient : nombreux sont les dessins représentant des troupeaux de bovins menés par des bergers. Leurs œuvres d'art figurent des scènes de chasse, de danse et d'affrontements, ainsi que de nombreux restes de poteries ou de pierres taillées. Les peintures rupestres ont été décrites par Henri Lhote dont les travaux ont été d'une part considérés, depuis l'indépendance de l'Algérie, comme un pillage et une dégradation du site et d'autre part utilisés par l'auteur sensationnaliste Erich von Däniken, pour étayer sa théorie des anciens astronautes qui interprète les masques rituels africains comme des combinaisons d'extraterrestres.\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nArticles connexes\nHoggar\nTadrart Acacus\nParc culturel du Tassili\nCyprès du Tassili (Cupressus dupreziana)\nSéfar\nSebeïba célébration compétitive de la région de Djanet\nArt rupestre du Sahara\nListe de sites pétroglyphiques en Algérie\nListe de sites d'art rupestre en Afrique\nListe de fossiles d'hominidés\nSites préhistoriques en Algérie\nListe des sites et monuments classés en Algérie\nListe du patrimoine mondial en Algérie\nListe du patrimoine culturel immatériel de l'humanité en Algérie\n\nBibliographie\nJean-Dominique Lajoux (préf.

          "content": "## Overview\nTassili n'Ajjer Cultural Park is in Saharan Algeria. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n## Understand\nThe Tassili n'Ajjer mountain range gained world fame after the discovery of ancient rock art in the 1930s. Over the years, more than 15000 petroglyphs and paintings were identified, as were a great number of archeological remains. With numerous stone tools and artifacts, ceramics, burial mounds, enclosures and general habitational remains, Tassili n'Ajjer has provided archeologists with a wealth of information about life in the region in Neolithic times. Therefore​, it is considered one of the most important sites of prehistoric cave art in the world.\nAs if all of that wasn't enough, Tassili n'Ajjer Cultural Park boast some stunning Saharan landscapes. Today, the massive Tassili itself is as good as uninhabited but the park attracts a good number of tourists and researchers alike.\n\n## Landscape\nAlthough the magnificent archeological treasures are the centre point of attention, the landscapes of Tassili n'Ajjer alone make a visit more than worthwhile. Centuries of changing climates and erosion have resulted in stunning geological formations of eroded sandstone rocks, creating an almost lunar landscape with so-called \"rock forests\" often reaching as far the eye can see. To see the most of the parks natural panoramas requires multiple day trips, but the majestic canyons and countless arches - most without official names - make up for all efforts you'll have to make.\n\n## Climate\nAs temperatures reach serious low points in December and January, and extreme highs from April to September, the main trekking seasons are October-November and February-March.\n\n## Get in\nThe nearest town and starting point of most tours into Tassili n'Ajjer is the oasis city Djanet. Air Algerie operates regular flights between Algiers and Djanet. The connection with flights to Paris, for example, are good, with rather short transfer times. Getting there from Paris should be possible in a 7-hour time frame, with return tickets (including the Algiers-Djanet flight) starting under €600. Furthermore, there are flights between Djanet and Illizi, In Amenas, Ghardaïa, and Ouargla.\nIf you're travelling overland, route N3 runs through the park to Djanet, but there's as good as no organized bus transport. Hitchhiking is a possibility, but comes with all the obvious risks. There is a bus to the Libyan border, but the prices for that trip are high and rising. In short, the main alternative to flying in, is driving in with you own (rented or not) vehicle. The road is long and mostly without great landscapes, but for independent travellers an overland approach was the preferred method for a long time. However, after the 2003 kidnappings regulations for overland travel tightened, making guides compulsory and off-track driving off-limits. As a result of these rules and the bureaucratic hassle that came with it, prices rose significantly.\n\n## Fees and permits\nAccess to the park and its sites is restricted, and you'll need to buy a permit to enter, plus a separate one if you want to take pictures. These can be obtained via all government-approved tour agencies or a Tassili Cultural Park conservationist. Typically, you should get your permit just the same day.\nTassili Cultural Park Office, BP 11, 33100 Djanet, ☏ +213 29 47 52 82.\n\n## Get around\nYou are allowed to work your own way around the authorized areas of Illizi, Bordj-el-Haous, and Djanet Fadnoun, but visiting the sites is only allowed when accompanied by an official tour guide. Tours include jeep rides, but to reach the plateau at the Tassili top, you'll have to rely on your own legs and some donkey or dromedary help. There is no road to the top, but you can choose from 3 passes: Afilalet, Assakao, and Aroun. Dromedaries can only access the Assakao pass, but donkeys manage all three options. As trips to the top take several days, count on taking lots of water and of course camping equipment.\nArranging a tour and supplies is relatively easy, as there are many small travel agencies around. Normally, it is possible to arrive in Djanet and set up a trip leaving the next day. There is no public transport available to get around the massive park.\n\n## See\nAncient rock art: petroglyphs and paintings depicting prehistoric life. You'll encounter images of cattle and wildlife, as well as figures, festivities and hunting scenes. Unfortunately, some of the most well-known images have been damaged due to copying by early discoverers and later travellers. Nevertheless, there are plenty of other, equally wonderful paintings that remain. Note the nature of wildlife depicted, which bears witness to the much moister climate of those ancient times, when there were lakes and rivers, and ample game to allow for human occupation of the area.\nRock formations and unique panoramas. Thousands of years of erosion by water and wind have sculptured a unique and massive collection of arches, labyrinths of sandstone streets and pinnacles, natural amphitheatres, steep gorges and other spectacular landscapes.\n\n## Do\nAs you'll need a guide to take you to the rock art sites, booking a tour is one of the first things you'll have to do. There's a good number of small agencies. Feel free to look around a bit and ask around. Prices can vary and are constantly rising. At the larger agencies, prices around 60 euro per person per day are not unusual.\n[dead link] Agence Essendilene. One of the larger agencies, and with a website. Offers 4WD and camel tours, as well as treks to the plateau.\nMohamed Touggui Travel Agency, BP 115 33100 Djanet, ☏ +213 66 62 15 77.\n\n## Eat\nIn Djanet, several basic restaurants are around and easy to spot in the centre. Once you're out in the park however, no food facilities are available. Everything you need, you'll have to take with you. When choosing a tour you typically have the choice between all-in versions, where camping equipment, food and water are provided for you, or a no-frills tour where you'll have to bring your own. In that case, make arrangements with your tour agency for sufficient pack animals.\n\n## Sleep\nYou might expect that the considerable foreign interest in Tassili n'Ajjer over the years would have led to ample facilities in the park and in Djanet. However, it has not. Lodging options in Djanet are limited and basic, and once you're headed into the park itself there are no facilities other than some stone windbreaks that previous travellers have left for your convenience. As for camping gear, it is possible to rent all or some of it, but bringing your own is the best idea still.\n\n## Djanet\nMost travel agencies offer basic lodging for their customers, but don't expect a lot more than a simple field bed or even just a safe place to put down your sleeping bag.\n\n## Around the sites\nThere are a number of designated camping spots, in an attempt to keep travellers litter from spreading too much. Your guide will typically determine where to sleep, and will in most cases refer to one of these spots. In several places, piled stone walls indicate trash areas. Leaving any litter there, or taking it with you, is preferred over burning, or burying it in the sand.\n\n## Stay safe\nPolitical situation: Tassili n'Ajjer covers a massive area of Algeria, on the border of Libya, Niger and Mali. Make sure to check the situation in the area prior to booking, as it is not the most stable of regions.\nSnakes and scorpions are to be avoided. Although snake bites in this area can be fatal, the animals are rare and easily spotted as they leave distinctive marks in the sand. Also, they typically don't come towards people. To be sure however, don't camp too close to vegetation and don't walk into thick undergrowth. Scorpions are less rare but also less deadly. Take the same precautions you would in all countries where scorpions are found: check your shoes before putting them on, and don't put your hands or feet into rock crevasses.",

          "content": "Tlemcen (; Arabic: تِلِمْسَان, romanized: Tilimsân) is the second-largest city in northwestern Algeria after Oran and is the capital of Tlemcen Province. The city has developed leather, carpet, and textile industries, which it exports through the port of Rachgoun. It had a population of 140,158, as of the 2008 census.\nA major centre of the Central Maghreb, the city is a mix of Arab, Berber, 'Āndalusī, Ottoman, and Western influences. From this mosaic of influences, the city derives the title of capital of Andalusian art in Algeria. Various titles are attributed to the city including \"the Pearl of the Maghreb\", \"the African Granada\" and \"the Medina of the West\".\n\nEtymology\nThe name Tlemcen (Tilimsân) was given by the Zayyanid King Yaghmurasen ibn Zyan. One possible etymology is that it comes from a Berber word tilmas 'spring, water-hole', or from the combination of the Berber words tala 'fountain', the preposition m-, and sân 'two', thus meaning 'two fountains'. Another proposed etymology is from the Zanata words talam 'junction' and sân 'two', referring to the town's geographic position, which links the desert regions to the south with the mountainous regions to the north.\n\nHistory\nPrehistory\nThe areas surrounding Tlemcen were inhabited during the Neolithic period, as evidenced by the discovery of polished axes in the caves of Boudghene by Gustave-Marie Bleicher in 1875.\nThere are three important prehistoric sites in the region: lake Karar, located one kilometer south of Remchi; the rock shelters of Mouilah, 5 km north of Maghnia; and the deposit called \"d'Ouzidan\", 2 km west of Aïn El Hout. The shelters found at the Mouilah and Boudghene show evidence of long periods of pre-historic human habitation.\n\nAntiquity\nIn AD 17, Tacfarinas led the Gaetuli to revolt against the Romans.\nTlemcen became a military outpost of Ancient Rome in the 2nd century CE under the name of Pomaria. It was then an important city in the North Africa see of the Roman Catholic Church, where it was the center of a diocese. Its bishop, Victor, was a prominent representative at the Council of Carthage (411), and its bishop Honoratus was exiled in 484 by the Vandal king Huneric for denying Arianism.\nIt was a center of a large Christian population for many centuries after the city's Arab conquest in 708 AD.\n\nEarly Islamic period\nIn the later eighth century and the ninth century, the city became a Kingdom of Banu Ifran with a Sufri Kharijite orientation. These same Berber Kharijis also began to develop various small Saharan oases and to link them into regular trans-Saharan caravan routes terminating at Tlemcen, beginning a process that would determine Tlemcen's historical role for almost all of the next millennium. In the late 8th century a settlement named Agadir existed on the site of former Roman Pomaria. Idris I founded a congregational mosque here, the Great Mosque of Agadir, circa 790 (no longer extant).\nIn 1081 or 1082 the Almoravid leader Yusuf ibn Tashfin founded the city of Tagrart (\"encampment\" in Berber language), just west of Agadir. The fusion of the two settlements of Tagrart and Agadir over time became what is now Tlemcen. At the same time as he founded Tagrart, Ibn Tashfin founded its congregational mosque, known today as the Great Mosque of Tlemcen, which was expanded in 1126 by his son and successor 'Ali Ibn Yusuf. He built a governor's residence next to it, known after as the Qasr al-Qadim (\"Old Palace\").\nIn the book Al-Istibsar fi 'agaib al-Amsar, written in the late 12th century, the author wrote:\n“It is a great and ancient city with numerous timeless ruins, indicating that it was once the capital of past nations. It lies at the foot of a mountain, most of whose trees are walnut. The city once had water brought in by the works of early civilizations from a spring called Burit, located six miles away. A large river, known as Satafsaif, flows through it. Tlemcen was the capital of the Zanata [tribe] kingdom and was surrounded by many tribes, both from Zanata and other Berber groups. It is a land of great fertility, with abundant resources, low prices, and plentiful blessings. The city governs many villages, continuous settlements, and numerous towns under its administration. Adjacent to Tlemcen, there is a fortified citadel rich in fruit-bearing trees and abundant in water and rivers. Connected to it is Mount Tawraniya, a vast, inhabited mountain filled with villages and continuous settlements.”\nControl of the region passed from the Almoravids to the Almohad Caliphate in the mid-twelfth century. After its conquest, the Almohad ruler 'Abd al-Mu'min surrounded the city with a wall in 1145 and built a new citadel. However, in the early thirteenth century, 'Abdallah ibn Ghaniya attempted to restore Almoravid control of the Maghreb. In about 1209, the region around Tlemcen was devastated by retreating Almoravid forces, not long before their final defeat by the Almohads at the Battle of Jebel Nafusa in 1210. Despite the destruction of Tlemcen's already-feeble agricultural base, Tlemcen rose to prominence as a major trading and administrative center in the region under the ensuing reign of the Almohads.\n\nZayyanid period\nAfter the end of Almohad rule in the 1230s, Tlemcen became the capital of one of the three successor states, the Zayyanid Kingdom of Tlemcen (1236–1554). The Zayyanid ruler Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan succeeded in merging Agadir and Tagrart into a single city and gave it the name Tlemcen. Initially, Yagmurasen resided in the Qasr al-Qadim but he soon moved the seat of power to a new citadel, the Mechouar, towards the mid 13th century. The city was thereafter ruled for centuries by successive Zayyanid sultans. During this era it was one of the most important economic and cultural centers in the region, alongside other political capitals like Fez, Tunis, and Granada. During the Middle Ages, Tlemcen not only served as a trading city connecting the \"coastal\" route across the Maghreb with the trans-Saharan caravan routes, but also housed a European trading center, or funduk which connected African and European merchants. African gold arrived in Tlemcen from south of the Sahara through Sijilmasa or Taghaza and entered European hands. Consequently, Tlemcen was partially integrated into the European financial system. For example, Genoese bills of exchange circulated there, at least among merchants not subject to (or not deterred by) religious prohibitions.\nAt the peak of its success in the first half of the fourteenth century, Tlemcen was a city of perhaps 40,000 inhabitants. It housed several well-known madrasas and numerous wealthy religious foundations, and became the principal centers of culture in the central Maghreb. The Zayyanids were the first to sponsor of the construction of madrasas in this part of the Maghreb, and among the most famous in Tlemcen was the Tashfiniya Madrasa founded by Abu Tashfin I (r. 1318–1337). At the souk around the Great Mosque, merchants sold woolen fabrics and rugs from the East, slaves and gold from across the Sahara, local earthenware and leather goods, and a variety of Mediterranean maritime goods \"redirected\" to Tlemcen by corsairs—in addition to imported European goods available at the funduk. Merchant houses based in Tlemcen, such as the al-Makkari, maintained regular branch offices in Mali and the Sudan.\nLater in the fourteenth century, the city twice fell under the rule of the Marinid sultan, Abu al-Hasan Ali (1337–1348) and his son Abu 'Inan. Both times the Marinids found that they were unable to hold the region against local resistance. Nevertheless, these episodes appear to have marked the beginning of the end. Over the following two centuries, Zayyanid Tlemcen was intermittently a vassal of Ifriqiya (then governed by the Hafsid dynasty), Maghrib al-Aqsa (then governed by the Marinid dynasty), or Aragon. When the Spanish took the city of Oran from the Zayyanids in 1509, continuous pressure from the Berbers prompted the Spanish to start a campaign against Tlemcen in 1543, which ended in the capture of the city and in the installation of a vassal king on the throne.\nThe ruler of Tlemcen is reported to have been advised by a Jewish viceroy named Abraham, who, in the time of the Inquisition of Torquemada, opened the gates of Tlemcen to Jewish and Muslim refugees fleeing Spain. Abraham is said to have supported them with his own money and with the tolerance of the king of Tlemcen.\n\nLater years\nIn 1551, Tlemcen came under Ottoman rule after the Campaign of Tlemcen. Tlemcen and the Algerian provinces regained effective independence in their own affairs in 1671, although Tlemcen was no longer a government seat as before. The Spanish were evicted from Oran in 1792, but thirty years later, they were replaced by the French, who seized Algiers. A French fleet bombarded Algiers in 1830, at which point the dey capitulated to French colonial rule; a broad coalition of natives continued to resist, coordinated loosely at Tlemcen.\nTlemcen was a vacation spot and retreat for French settlers in Algeria, who found it far more temperate than Oran or Algiers. The city adapted and became more cosmopolitan, with a unique outlook on art and culture, and its architecture and urban life evolved to accommodate this new sense. In the independence movements of the mid-twentieth century, it was relatively quiet, reflecting the city's sense of aloofness from the turbulence of Algiers. In 1943 Tlemcen was little more than a railway halt. On January 13 a British and American train patrol engaged in a skirmish with the retreating troops of the Afrika Korps. As the US Army marched eastwards from its Moroccan landing grounds, the British 8th Army drove west, forcing the Germans into an evacuation pocket at Tunis. Between 1942–1943, before embarking for Italy, the US Army Medical Corps established two fixed hospitals at Tlemcen: 9th Evacuation (as station), 12–26 December 1942. Seven hundred and fifty beds and 32d Station, 28 February – 28 November 1943, 500 beds.\nThe most important place for pilgrimage of all religions into Tlemcen was the Jewish cemetery on the outskirts of town. Up to 10,000 people worldwide made the journey to the site. Nonetheless, despite religious freedoms, their community had never numbered more than 5,000–6,000 in the 20th century, and discriminatory laws of had been in force since 1881. After Algerian independence in 1962, most of the small Jewish population evacuated to metropolitan France. The Berber tribes historically professed Judaism. During the colonial period they served in the French Army. French Jews of the Alliance Israélite Universelle paid for a local Jewish school, which closed in 1934, perhaps owing to the rise of Fascism. In 2009 Jordanian sources reported that the Algerian government intended to restore the damaged Jewish tombs at the historic cemetery.\n\nClimate\nTlemcen has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh).\n\nCulture\nIts centuries of rich history and culture have made the city a center of a unique blend of music and art. Its textiles and handcrafts, its elegant display of Andalusi culture, and its cool climate in the mountains have made it an important center of tourism in Algeria.

          "summary": "Tlemcen (; Arabic: تِلِمْسَان, romanized: Tilimsân) is the second-largest city in northwestern Algeria after Oran and is the capital of Tlemcen Province. The city has developed leather, carpet, and textile industries, which it exports through the port of Rachgoun. It had a population of 140,158, as of the 2008 census.\nA major centre of the Central Maghreb, the city is a mix of Arab, Berber, 'Āndalusī, Ottoman, and Western influences. From this mosaic of influences, the city derives the title of capital of Andalusian art in Algeria. Various titles are attributed to the city including \"the Pearl of the Maghreb\", \"the African Granada\" and \"the Medina of the West\".",

          "content": "Tlemcen (en arabe : تلمسان, Tilimsān ; en berbère : ⵜⵍⴻⵎⵙⵉⵏ , Tlemsin), Pomaria à l'époque antique, est une commune de la wilaya de Tlemcen, dont elle est le chef-lieu.\nElle est située au nord-ouest de l'Algérie, à 520 km à l'ouest d'Alger, à 140 km au sud-ouest d'Oran et, proche de la frontière du Maroc, à 76 km à l'est de la ville marocaine d'Oujda. La ville est érigée dans l'arrière-pays et distante de 40 km de la mer Méditerranée.\nAncienne capitale du Maghreb central, la ville mêle influences arabes, arabo-andalouses, ottomanes, berbères, hispano-mauresques, et occidentales. De cette mosaïque d'influences, la ville tire le titre de capitale de l'art andalou en Algérie. Selon l'auteur Dominique Mataillet, divers titres sont attribués à la ville dont « la perle du Maghreb », « la Grenade africaine » et « la Médine de l'Occident ».\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nLe territoire de la commune de Tlemcen est situé au centre de sa wilaya. Elle est située à 141 km au sud-ouest d'Oran, à 547 km à l'ouest d'Alger, à 310 km au nord d'Aïn Sefra, à 91 km de Sidi Bel Abbès et 569 km de Béchar.\n\nRelief\nTlemcen est adossée aux monts de Tlemcen, sur les derniers plateaux de la Mesta sud oranaise, et tournée vers la mer, que l’on aperçoit à 50 km par la trouée que fait la Tafna dans la chaîne côtière des Trara.\nLa ville, établie sur un plateau calcaire à 800 m d'altitude, repose adroitement au sud du promontoire rocheux de Lalla Setti, enserrée entre les villages d'El Eubbad à l'est et de Mansourah à l'ouest.\nLa ville surplombe la haute plaine de Tlemcen qui s'étale à ses pieds, son horizon étant encadré par le massif des Traras. Elle surplombe les plaines de Hennaya au nord et de Maghnia à l’ouest, qui constituent le vaste territoire du Ḥawz irrigué par la Tafna, et l'oued Isser et leurs affluents. En outre les nombreuses sources qui descendent en cascades du massif, offrent à la région oliveraies, grandes et petites cultures, vignobles, bois et pâturages.\n\nClimat\nCet agencement géologique sert de couloir à l'air marin qui tempère la rigueur des hivers et la chaleur des étés. La région de Tlemcen s'inscrit comme un îlot arrosé au milieu des zones semi-arides de la Moulouya marocaine à l'ouest, de Sidi Bel Abbès et Mascara à l'est et d'El Aricha au sud.\n\nTransports\nTlemcen est desservie par l'aéroport international de Tlemcen - Zenata - Messali El Hadj situé à 22 km au nord-ouest de la ville.\nLa ville dispose d'une télécabine, inaugurée en 2009, qui relie les quartiers ouest de la ville au plateau de Lalla-Seti, à plus de 1 200 m d'altitude ; il est très fréquenté durant le week-end par les familles en quête de divertissements.\nTlemcen est reliée à l'autoroute Est-Ouest, longue de 1 216 km, dont elle est proche de l'extrémité occidentale. Elle permet de relier Tlemcen à Annaba, ville située à son extrémité orientale, en 10 heures de route. En outre, elle est reliée à Alger via la Route nationale 13 et à Oran par la Route nationale 2.\nLe transport ferroviaire connaît un nouveau développement depuis le début des années 1990, notamment par la mise en circulation d'un train interurbain reliant Tlemcen à Sabra et qui assure aussi le transport estudiantin. Le transport ferroviaire est marqué, dans les années 2000, par la reprise de la ligne ferroviaire de transport de voyageurs entre Oran et Tlemcen via Sidi Bel Abbès et la réouverture de la ligne reliant Tlemcen à Maghnia. Ces embranchements sur le réseau ferroviaire ont facilité le transport des marchandises et des produits des secteurs économiques de Tlemcen mais également d'Ouled Mimoun, Maghnia et Ghazaouet.\n\nLocalités\nEn 1984, la commune de Tlemcen est constituée à partir des localités suivantes : Tlemcen, Abou Tachefine, Sidi Boumédiène, Kiffane Nord, Koudia et Boudghène.\n\nToponymie\nSelon une première hypothèse, le nom de Tlemcen proviendrait du mot berbère Tilimsan, agglutination des deux mots telem et sin signifiant selon Ibn Khaldoun « composé de la terre et de la mer » ; le mot est cité pour la première fois par Tabari qui mentionne Tlemcen en parlant des Banou Ifren. Quant à Yahya Ibn Khaldoun, il indique que Tlemcen signifierait « le Désert et le Tell ».\nSelon une autre hypothèse, le nom de Tlemcen signifierait « sources ou poches d'eau captées », en langue berbère.\nEnfin, selon Michel Malherbe, le nom de la ville proviendrait de Tala Imsan, « la source tarie » en berbère. Certains historiens modernes ont rapproché le mot Tlemcen de tilmasit dont le pluriel tilmasin, désigne « la terre ou le champ fertile avec beaucoup d'eau et de vergers ».\nSous le règne des Zianides, la ville a porté sa dénomination définitive qui est Talamsan. À l’époque romaine, elle avait comme dénomination Pomaria qui signifie « verger de pommes » en latin. Après l’islamisation de la ville, elle a changé de nom pour devenir Agadir qui signifie « rocher fortin » en berbère. Sous le règne des Almoravides, le camp implanté à l’ouest lors du siège en 1069, s’est transformé en un nouveau centre urbain, distinct de Tagrart, qui signifie « camp » en langue des Zénètes.\nDans les textes arabes le toponyme de la ville figure sous différentes graphies : Tilimsān ; Tinimsān ; Tlamsin ; Tlamsan ; Tāferzat ; Aqādir ; Ağādir ; Ağadir ; Talšān ; Balnsān. Les auteurs arabes médiévaux la nomment dès le IXe siècle Tlemcen, même quand ils font la distinction entre deux villes : Agadir  et Tagrart, ces auteurs mentionnent que Tlemcen est divisée ou constituée de deux villes. La ville est appelée aussi Madīnat ou Arḍ al-Ḏjidār (« la ville du Mur) » par allusion au mur dans le Coran.\n\nHistoire\nPréhistoire\nLa proche région de Tlemcen a été habitée à l'époque néolithique. Les grottes situées dans la proximité et les artefacts découverts témoignent de la présence humaine dès l'époque préhistorique, ce dont témoigne la découverte en 1875 par Gustave-Marie Bleicher de haches polies dans les grottes de Boudghène. En 1941, M. Estaunié[Qui ?] a mis au jour, à Bab El Qarmadin, un magnifique polissoir néolithique actuellement conservé au musée de la ville.\nIl existe trois gisements préhistoriques importants dans la région : le lac Karar à 1 km au sud de Remchi, les abris sous roches de la Mouilah à 5 km au nord de Maghnia et le gisement dit « d'Ouzidan » à 2 km à l'est d'Aïn El Hout. Les abris de la Mouilah et de Boudghène présentaient les meilleures conditions d'habitat pour l'homme préhistorique qui s'y est fixé durablement.\n\nAntiquité\nÀ la fin du IIe siècle, au début de l'ère sévèrienne, un castrum romain est installé sur un piton rocheux qui domine la plaine de Chetouane. Son nom de Pomaria signifie « vergers » en latin, sans doute en référence à la plaine fertile qu'il domine. Ce camp, qui est créé en même temps qu'Altava et Numerus Syrorum, avait pour rôle de surveiller les confins de la Maurétanie. C'est l'acte de naissance d'une cité qui va jouer un rôle religieux puisqu'elle devient le siège d'un diocèse chrétien : l'évêque Victor, qui y officie, joue un rôle important au concile de Carthage de 412.\nEn 429, les Vandales, un peuple germanique venant d'Andalousie, débarquent à l'embouchure de la Moulouya et s'emparent de la Maurétanie, mais ils ne contrôlent que la côte ; une principauté berbère s'érige autour de Pomaria, qui prend alors le nom berbère d'Agadir. C'est une période caractérisée par l'apparition de principautés berbères dirigées par des seigneurs locaux, probablement par la tribu des Ifran. Elle dure 120 ans, jusqu'à ce que les Romains revenus d'Orient reprennent le pays.\nLes seuls vestiges connus de cette époque sont des pierres tombales enchâssées dans la structure du minaret d'Agadir. Plusieurs épitaphes chrétiennes tardives (Ve et VI° siècles) ont été découverts. Plusieurs auteurs arabes médiévaux évoquent les constructions antiques de la ville.\n\nPériode des dynasties islamiques\nDébut de la période islamique\nSelon Ibn Khaldoun, la région est avant l'arrivée des Omeyyades le royaume des Zénètes, dont les Banou Ifren et les Maghraouas, des tribus qui mènent une vie pastorale et rurale. Le même auteur signale que les Maghraouas ont été les premiers Berbères à discuter avec le calife Othmân ibn Affân lors de l'avènement de l'islam ; Ouezmar Ibn Saclab fut leur premier ambassadeur auprès du calife qui le désigne pour gouverner les Zenètes. Toujours selon Ibn Khaldoun, à la suite d'Ibn al Raqiq, Tlemcen est conquise par Abou el Mohajir Dinar, successeur de Oqba. En souvenir de ce passage, une source porte encore le nom d'Aïn el Modjir à l'époque d'Ibn Khaldoun qui vécut un temps à la cour des souverains de Tlemcen au XIVe siècle.\nEn 765, dans la mouvances d'autres tribus berbères sur l'ensemble du Maghreb, les Banou Ifren s'insurgent en 765 et somment d'autres tribus de se convertir au kharidjisme. Ils proclament calife leur chef Abou Qurra qui constitue un royaume kharéjite sufrite à Tlemcen. Abou Qurra prend la tête d'une armée de 40 000 hommes et assiège Tobna où le général abbasside Omar Ibn Hafs est retranché avant de se mettre en campagne sur Kairouan. Il cerne cette ville mais échoue à la prendre. Abou Qurra et ses Beni Ifren regagnent Tlemcen. Il ne reste comme vestige de cette période que le nom d'une porte occidentale de la ville, appelée Bab Abu Qorra (aujourd'hui Qorrane) mais c'est à l'occasion de cet épisode historique que la cité entre dans l'histoire du Maghreb. Elle passa ensuite sous le pouvoir de la dynastie des Banou Khazar.\nAbd al-Rahmân Ibn Rustom, kharidjite crée un État ibadite englobant l'Ifriqiya. En 760, il est attaqué et vaincu par le gouverneur d'Égypte. Il abandonne l'Ifriqiya aux armées arabes et se réfugie dans l'Ouest algérien où il fonde Tahert en 761 qui devient la capitale du royaume rostémide.\n\nL'assise de l'imamat rostémide de Tahert repose sur les tribus berbères du Maghreb central acquises à la doctrine kharidjite et va s'étendre de Tlemcen à l'ouest aux monts du Hodna à l'est. Tlemcen et sa principauté suffrite deviennent une marche du Maghreb central rostémide, partageant une obédience kharéjite proche et opposée à l'orthodoxie de Kairouan.\nLa ville joue un rôle important lors de la conquête de la péninsule Ibérique puisque c'est dans cette ville que Tariq ibn Ziyad retient en otage les enfants du comte Julien.\nÀ l'est, le nouveau pouvoir des chérifs idrissides menace le domaine des Rostémides. Après avoir soumis le nord du Maghreb extrême, Idriss Ier franchit la Moulouya et pénètre au Maghreb central jusqu'à Tlemcen. Son intention est alors de conquérir la région orano-tlémcenienne jusqu'alors dans l'obédience kharidjite du Maghreb central. En 790, Idrîss Ier obtient de Mohammed Ibn Khazar, émir des Zénata, la possession de la cité et, après un séjour de quelques mois pendant lequel il pose les fondements de la mosquée-cathédrale, reprend la route du Maghreb el-Aksa (actuel Maroc). Sous les Idrissides, la ville se dote d'une enceinte défensive qui s'ouvre par cinq portes. Al-Bakri la décrit comme « une grande ville qui possède des bazars, des mosquées, des moulins et même une église fréquentée par les chrétiens. Elle est un point de réunion pour les marchands de tous les pays et n'a jamais cessé d'être la demeure des hommes savants dans la loi et la tradition… ».\nDans la marche orano-tlemcenienne le retour au kharidjisme est important et encouragé par les Rostémides, la conquête d'Idriss est éphémère. Idriss II lance une autre expédition vers 805 pour reprendre Tlemcen mais n'ose pas affronter les Rostémides et Tahert directement. Il conclut un accord avec les Aghlabides de Kairouan pour prendre l’État kharidjite en tenaille. Les Aghlabides lui reconnaissent en échange le droit moral d'occuper Tlemcen. La région est encore perdue par les Idrissides. À la mort d'Idriss II, son fils aine Mohamed concède à son frère Souleiman la charge de reprendre et de gouverner la région : cette entente est à la base de la création d'un royaume Soleïmanides compris entre Tlemcen et le Chélif et dont le but est de miner l'autorité morale des kharidjites au Maghreb central. Cependant cette politique centrée sur les chérif échoue : ces derniers au Maghreb central ou au Maghreb extrême se replient entourés de notables arabes dans les villes, et laissent graviter autour des centres de pouvoir des tribus berbères de facto indépendantes. Le pays orano-tlemcénien était contrôlé par les tribus zénatiennes, Maghrawa et Banu Ifran.\n\nLes sources numismatiques concourent à apporter des nuances à l'interprétation énoncée par Ibn Abi Zar de l'ère mérinide, qui fait mention d'une période idrisside. Trois pièces de monnaie, n'appartenant pas à l'époque idrisside et datées respectivement de 796-797, 806-807 et 813-814, apportent la preuve que Tlemcen ne se trouvait pas sous la domination idrisside quelques années seulement après la prétendue conquête d'Idrīs Ier. Bien qu'Idrīs Ier ait peut-être visité Tlemcen, son autorité semble n'y avoir été que temporaire et de manière fugace, n'ayant pas laissé de traces dans le domaine numismatique.\nPar la suite, Idris II prend possession de la ville en 814, mais il ne s'agit plus d'une conquête, mais plutôt d'une visite de caractère officiel. Avant cette visite, une pièce de monnaie portant le nom d'un individu nommé al-Layṯ témoigne à nouveau que la domination idrisside n'était pas pleinement reconnue. En revanche, après la venue d'Idrīs II, deux dirhams frappés respectivement aux années 822-823 et 827-828 sont émis en son nom à Tlemcen par Muḥammad b. Sulaymān.\nQuant à l'inscription de la mosquée d'Aghadir, le récit s'appuie sur un témoignage oral datant du XIIe siècle, visant à renforcer la crédibilité du récit. Toutefois, il est à noter que ces deux mentions concernant la mosquée de Tlemcen sont introduites pour la première fois par Ibn Abi Zar et qu'aucune source antérieure à la période mérinide ne vient corroborer ces assertions, qui ont ensuite été reprises par des historiens ultérieurs.\n\nPériode des empires maghrébins\nLes Rostémides et les Soleïmanides assistent de fait au morcellement de leur territoire qui tombe aux mains de chefferies berbères. Une tribu en particulier, les Sanhadja Talkata, exerce une suprématie sur les autres tribus grâce à son nombre, son armée et la qualité de son chef : Menad père d'un certain Ziri, fondateur de la dynastie des Zirides\nEn 931, l'allié des Fatimides, Moussa Ibn Abi el-Afia, marche sur Agadir et détrône le gouverneur idrisside, El-Hassen, fils d'Abu el-Aich. Les Fatimides règnent durant 24 ans, jusqu'en 955. Agadir est alors enlevée par les troupes omeyyades d'Abd al-Rahman III, calife de Cordoue. L'Ifrénide Yala Ibn Mohamed, maître du pays des Zenata, obtient du souverain le gouvernement de la cité, mais il est tué par Jawhar al-Siqilli, chef des Fatimides, ce qui provoque un conflit dans toute la région de Tlemcen. Les Maghraouas et les Banou Ifren s'unissent alors contre les Zirides, vassaux des Fatimides. Cette union des Zénètes leur permet de rester souverains dans l'Ouest du Maghreb.\nMais Ziri Ibn Attia, chef des Maghraouas, fait alliance avec les Zirides, ce qui provoque la réaction de Yeddou des Banou Ifren qui fait la guerre aux trois puissances du Maghreb : les Maghraouas, les Zirides et les Omeyyades. Yeddu est toutefois vaincu par Ziri Ibn Attia.\nSelon Al-Nowaïri, la ville aurait été vidée de sa population sous le règne de Bologhine ibn Ziri, consécutivement à une attaque menée par les Zanāta. Ces derniers auraient déplacé les habitants de Tlemcen vers Achir, la capitale des Zirides. En commémoration de leur ancienne ville, les Zirides auraient par la suite construit une nouvelle ville qu'ils nommèrent Balinsan. Toutefois, même en prenant en considération ce récit, il est peu probable que Tlemcen ait été complètement vidée de sa population et que le site ait été totalement abandonné.\n\nLes Banou Ifren sont attaqués par la coalition des Hammadides et des Hilaliens en 1058, qui l'emportent. Abu Soda des Banou Ifren de Tlemcen est le dernier commandant des troupes zénètes à tenir tête aux attaques de cette coalition. Après sa défaite, presque tout le Maghreb passe sous contrôle des Hilaliens et du reste des Hammadides[réf. nécessaire]. Le pouvoir y est alors accaparé par les Banou Khazar des Maghraouas, notamment par Yala et ses descendants, la ville devient leur capitale.\nEn 1080, avec l'installation des Almoravides, le site de la ville est déplacé plus à l'ouest : c'est Tagrart qui devient, après Marrakech, la seconde capitale de l'Empire almoravide. La nouvelle ville annexe Agadir au cours de son expansion. La ville connaît une certaine dynamique urbanistique sous les Almoravides : c'est durant cette période qu'est érigée la Grande Mosquée fondée par Ali Ben Youssef.\nEn 1143 Tlemcen passe sous les Almohades, Abd al-Mumin l'entoura d’un solide rempart en 1145. Tagrart est habitée par les officiels, Agadir par le peuple. Tlemcen, en raison de son rôle stratégique, devient un chef-lieu de province. Les Almohades, qui y frappent leur monnaie, édifient des châteaux, de grandes maisons, des palais et de solides remparts, des foundouks et un port à Honaïne pour le commerce transafricain et méditerranéen. À cette époque, Tlemcen est un pôle commercial de premier plan et la capitale du Maghreb central.\n\nCapitale des Zianides\nEn 1235, elle devient la capitale du Royaume zianide qui s'étendit au XIVe siècle, la position de la cité zianide rendait son séjour agréable et favorisait son activité commerciale. Bâtie à mi-hauteur d'une pente, au milieu des vergers, elle présentait tant de charmes qu'un écrivain arabe la comparait à « une jeune fiancée sur son lit nuptial ». Elle commandait le carrefour de plusieurs grandes voies, surtout de celles qui conduisaient des ports de Honaïne (à 36 km à l'est de Maghnia) et d'Oran au Tafilelt.\nLe royaume berbère de Tlemcen est fondé par Yaghmoracen Ibn Zian, de la dynastie Zénète des Abdalwadides, pour un règne qui va durer près de cinquante ans (1236-1283). La grandeur de la ville médiévale est un fait indiscutable, du moins d'un point de vue urbanistique, comme l'attestent les textes et les monuments actuels.\nYaghmoracen Ibn Zian prend Tlemcen et fait construire une grande mosquée. Son règne est rapporté par Ibn Khaldoun, qui mentionne des anecdotes à son sujet. Ainsi, le roi qui est décrit comme magnanime se riait des généalogistes qui voulaient le faire descendre du prophète Mahomet, et devant ceux qui voulaient inscrire son nom sur un minaret qu'il avait fait élever à Tlemcen, il répondit dans la seule langue qu'il connaissait, le berbère : « Dieu sait » (Issen Rebbi).\n\nEn 1370, Ibn Khaldoun est venu se réfugier chez le sultan zianide de Tlemcen, Abou Hammou Moussa II, alors qu'une guerre éclate entre la cité et Fès. Il y assume les fonctions de grand vizir de la cour, l'un des plus hauts postes qui lui aient été attribués, et prend en charge une mission à Biskra, en vue de recruter des soldats parmi les tribus arabes des Dhawawidas. Son séjour à Tlemcen constitue ainsi une étape très importante dans sa vie. Durant ses différents passages à Tlemcen, il enseigne aussi dans la Médersa Al Khaldounia, située dans le quartier d'El Eubad à proximité de la mosquée d'Abou Madyane et considérée comme un joyau architectural.\nÀ son apogée, au XVe siècle, cet État contrôlait un territoire allant de l'Atlas à l'actuelle Tunisie. Il attirait les savants et les artistes de toutes parts. La fonction culturelle de la capitale se matérialise aussitôt par l'érection de nombreux monuments, chefs-d'œuvre qui ont pendant longtemps caractérisé le royaume de Tlemcen. L'activité culturelle et scientifique se développa également grâce au mécénat de certains princes, notamment Abû Tâshfîn (1318-1337) et Abou Hammou Moussa II (1359-1389).\n\nCette ville était aussi un centre d'études musulmanes, qui comptait cinq médersas renommées. Les Tlemceniens admiraient Sidi Wahhab, qui fut le compagnon du prophète et qui, venu à la suite de Oqba avait été enterré dans la ville ; Sidi Daoudi, le grand saint du Xe siècle et surtout Abou Madyane, le  mystique andalou du XIIe siècle.\n\n« Tlemcen, écrit un auteur arabe du XIVe siècle, est la patrie d'une foule d'hommes de bien et d'honneur, de personnes sûres et respectables, de gens honnêtes et religieux… Pour la plupart, les habitants de Tlemcen s'adonnent à l'agriculture et à la fabrication des haïks en laine ; ils excellent dans la confection des vêtements fins… C'est ce qui a valu aux Tlemceniens la réputation dont ils jouissaient jadis et qu'ils ont encore à présent.\nLe rayonnement de la capitale du Maghreb central trouve son fondement dans plusieurs aspects, avec une emphase particulière sur son bon fonctionnement économique. Les récits des voyageurs-géographes convergent vers la mise en évidence de la fécondité des terres environnantes de Tlemcen, caractérisée par l'abondance et la diversité de ses cultures, englobant notamment les céréales et les fruits. De surcroît, leur attention se porta sur les moulins, plus spécifiquement les moulins hydrauliques. De plus, les auteurs mentionnent également la présence de marchés prolifiques et animés, constitués en partie par une offre variée de produits.\nLes produits de l'industrie tlemcenienne sont vendus sur les marchés les plus reculés de l'Orient et de l'Occident. Ajoutez à cela que Tlemcen est une pépinière de savants réputés pour leur enseignement remarquable, et de saints bien connus pour leur profonde piété. ». Les voyageurs citent les produits d'exportation qui sont à base de laine (habits, vêtements, etc.) dont Ibn Saïd note la qualité et la perfection qui « [...] dépassent tous ceux du Maghreb » ou de cuir : brides, selles avec leurs accessoires. Al-Zuhri mentionne de confection de tapis de haute qualité.\nÀ son apogée, Tlemcen comptait environ 100 000 habitants. Au cours du XVe siècle, la population a considérablement diminué en raison des conflits constants entre les Zianides et les Mérinides. Selon Al-Wazzan, après la chute du pouvoir des Mérinides, la population était de 13 000 feux, comparée aux 16 000 feux de l'époque d'Abû Tâshfîn. Malgré cette diminution, la ville restait une étape majeure dans les échanges commerciaux entre l'Europe et le Soudan, assurant ainsi l'approvisionnement de ses habitants.\nAu début du XVIe siècle, Léon l'Africain insistait sur la loyauté renommée des commerçants de Tlemcen. Selon l'auteur, les habitants de Tlemcen étaient répartis en quatre classes distinctes : les artisans, les commerçants, les étudiants et les soldats. Par ailleurs, il mentionne que les Tlemceniens possédaient des résidences secondaires situées en dehors de la ville, qu'ils utilisaient pendant la saison estivale. Ces maisons étaient bien construites et contribuaient au confort des habitants. Léon l'Africain mentionne également la présence de grands hammams de qualité et de maisons bien édifiées à Tlemcen. De plus, il décrit la prospérité de l'artisanat et du commerce dans les divers quartiers de Tlemcen. L'auteur fait également référence aux fondouks de la ville, dont deux étaient spécifiquement destinées à l'hébergement des négociants génois et vénitiens. La société tlemcénienne était « polie, dévote et cultivée », d'après Georges Marçais.\n\nRelation avec l'Andalousie et Reconquista\nTlemcen eut des échanges divers avec l'Espagne musulmane par des échanges et apportera aides militaires contre la Reconquista chrétienne. Les Nasrides signent des traités de paix avec les souverains zianides de Tlemcen, ils deviennent alors alliés un temps contre la couronne d'Aragon et les Mérinides qui furent précédemment les alliés des Nasrides.\nPlusieurs sultans de Tlemcen furent élevés dans les cours d'al-Andalus, comme le quatrième roi de la dynastie des Banou Abdelouad, Abou Tachfin fils d’Abou Hammou, élevé à la cour Nasride de Grenade où il recevra son initiation princière au palais de l’Alhambra. Tlemcen est restée longtemps une ville amarrée à l’Andalousie décrite et chantée par ses poètes. Les habitants des deux capitales avaient beaucoup d’affinités et partageaient les mêmes traditions dans l’habillement, l’art culinaire enfin, le parler avec ses inflexions particulières communes.\nLes poètes andalous, Ibn Khafadja, Lissan Eddine Ibn el Khatib, le soufi Mahieddine Ibn Arabi de Murcie témoigneront chacun de sa beauté, la comparant souvent à Grenade. Tout comme les poètes, les princes zianides feront également des séjours fréquents en Andalousie. Honaïne, le port de Tlemcen, était distant de Murcie de deux jours de bateau seulement, ce qui la rendait très proche par mer et plus que d’autres villes dans le Maghreb, de Murcie. Cette proximité rendait plus ou moins facile les échanges entre Tlemcen et Grenade les deux capitales zianide et nasride au destin commun né, qui, rappelons-le, au même moment, sur les décombres de l’ancien Empire almohade au XIIIe siècle s’y sont taillés des royaumes. Le grand poète tlemcenien Ibn el Khamis (XIIIIe siècle) passa plusieurs années de sa vie à Grenade où il mourut. Cette relation perpétuelle entre les deux capitales, a fait de Tlemcen la jumelle africaine de Grenade.\n\nL'influence andalouse s'accentua au XIIe siècle, lorsque la r\neconquête dirigée par les rois chrétiens et achevée par les Rois catholiques fit refluer sur l'Afrique du Nord les Moros (Maures) qui sont à l'origine de ces communautés andalouses qui ont gardé les clés de leurs maisons abandonnées en Andalousie mauresque, ainsi que leur connaissance, genre musical et poétique. L’arrivée de ces Andalous raffinés et industrieux va d’ailleurs aider Tlemcen à s’ériger en vraie capitale arabo-musulmane avec ses palais, ses mosquées, ses médersas, ses foundouks, son commerce transsaharien et méditerranéen et, enfin, une riche vie de cour à l’intérieur du Méchouar et où les musiciens avaient une place d’honneur autant que les poètes et les artistes.\nD'après l'historien tlemcenien Al-Maqqarî, après la chute de Grenade, de nombreux membres du clan Bannigas ont abjuré l'islam et ont ainsi formé le noyau de la famille chrétienne des Venegas, cela-dit, d'autres membres du clan ont gardé l'islam pour religion et se sont réfugiés à Oran. Quant à Boabdil, il est allé vivre à Fès avec certains membres de sa famille, d'autres sont venus à Tlemcen, comme son oncle Mohammed XIII az-Zaghall où il sera enterré dans la nécropole royale zianide de Sidi Brahim. Sa pierre tombale sera découverte en 1848, elle fut présentée pour la première fois à l'Exposition universelle de 1889.\nÀ Tlemcen, un nombre relativement important d’Andalous et de Morisques y trouveront la paix, dont de nombreux juifs, fuyant l’inquisition des Rois catholiques pendant la Reconquista. Avec ces exodes, c'est une partie de la mémoire andalouse qui va également émigrer dans cette ville. Elle sera l'une des héritières d'al-Andalus de par son art de vivre et de ses legs philosophiques et artistiques. L'histoire de Tlemcen signale que dans cette ville 50 000 Andalous, venus du royaume de Cordoue, trouvèrent asile ; on reconnaissait autrefois leurs descendants à leur costume particulier, plein d'élégance et de faste, et surtout à leur large ceinturon de soie aux couleurs chatoyantes ; de même qu'on reconnaît leurs maisons de style mauresque, avec le patio formé de galeries à arcades, les vasques à jet d'eau, les parterres de jasmins et de giroflées.\nUn extrait d'un texte d'Ibn Saïd résume d'une façon spécifique l'image économique de Tlemcen: « Les Andalous la percevaient comme une ville andalouse, pour son eau, ses jardins et la multiplicité de ses industries ». Dans le langage de la ville se mêlent des mots comme rojo/a, moreno/a, cuadra, barato, gusto, falta, miseria, etc., emprunts linguistiques permis par les brassages de populations du pourtour méditerranéen consécutifs aux « conquêtes, migrations et exodes ».\n\nPériode ottomane\nAvec le XVIe siècle et l'effondrement de la dynastie zianide, la ville entre en décadence, passant des 100 000 habitants au moment de son apogée, à des chiffres variant selon les auteurs de 7 000 ou 8 000 habitants à plus de 10 000 habitants dans la période pré-coloniale (entre 12 000 et 14 000 au début du XIXe siècle).\nEn 1516, le souverain zianide Abou Abdallah Mohamed II meurt sans laisser de successeur, ce qui engendre des conflits dans la dynastie. Son oncle Abou Hammou Moussa III devient souverain, après avoir attaqué et mis en prison l'émir Abou Zeyane, frère aîné du défunt roi. Il s'allie aux Espagnols, ce qui provoque l'hostilité de la population qui appelle à son secours le fameux Arudj Barberousse. Accueilli en libérateur, il rétablit Abou Zeyane sur le trône. Abou Hammou Moussa prend alors la fuite et demande asile et vengeance aux Espagnols basés à Oran.\nCes derniers s'emparent de la Kalâa des Beni Rached et tuent Ishaq, un frère d'Aroudj. Ils attaquent ensuite Tlemcen sous le commandant de Dom Martin d'Argote, qui avait ramené avec lui les contingents musulmans restés fidèles à Abou Hammou Moussa. Pendant une courte durée, la ville passe sous la souveraineté du gouverneur espagnol d'Oran puis sous la domination d'Arudj Barberousse qui est fait prisonnier à Tlemcen en 1518 puis tué.\nLa cité devient ottomane en 1553, après que le dernier roi zianide, Moulay Hassan, se réfugie à Oran. Les Ottomans ne font pas de Tlemcen le siège d'un beylicat, les villes de Mazouna, Mascara et enfin Oran, reprise aux Espagnols au XVIIIe siècle, la remplaçant comme capitale de l'Ouest algérien. Elle devient alors une ville parmi d'autres du Beylik de l'Ouest, dont la capitale ne sera jamais la cité zianide, mais bel et bien Alger. Tlemcen donne à la régence d'Alger et à l'Empire ottoman un beylerbey, en la personne de Youssef Pacha[Passage contradictoire avec l'article Liste des gouverneurs de la Régence d'Alger, section Beylerbeys], gouverneur de la ville.\nLes Kouloughlis, à côté de la population autochtone de souche citadine dite Hadar, forment la majorité de la population. Ils ont leur propre divan et perçoivent l'impôt de zones délimitées qui constituent leur « État » personnel. Tlemcen demeure un siège d'une grande activité artisanale et commerciale, la ville avait plus de 500 métiers à tisser, tous les métiers et tous les commerces sont répartis entre diverses places et rues. Les familles d’origine turque:\nDurant la période ottomane (XVIe-XIXe siècle), plusieurs familles tlemcéniennes furent issues des Kouloughlis, descendants de soldats et d’administrateurs ottomans mariés à des femmes locales.\nCes familles ont marqué la vie sociale, religieuse et économique de la ville.\nParmi elles figurent : Kahoudji, Brixi, Berrezoug, Nebia, Benyelles, Gourmala, Korso, Bouchenak, Benosman et Bendella.\n\nColonisation française\nAprès la chute d'Alger en 1830 et le début de la conquête de l'Algérie par la France, le souverain chérifien souhaite s'emparer de la ville. Les Marocains se retirent finalement de la ville devant l'émir Abd el-Kader. Après l'expédition de Mascara en 1834, la ville est conquise en 1836 par le maréchal Bertrand Clauzel qui impose un impôt aux habitants.\nPar le traité de la Tafna, la ville devient en 1837 l'une des capitales de l'État d'Abd el-Kader avant d'être définitivement occupée par les Français en 1842. Elle devient alors chef-lieu de la cinquième division militaire d'Oran et se voit dotée d'un sous-préfet en 1858.\nDurant cette période, la ville est marquée par un exode de sa population qui préfère s'expatrier à l'étranger, notamment vers la Syrie, la Turquie et le Maroc, que de rester sous domination coloniale. Ainsi, une importante communauté s'implante à Fès et forme, avec des Algériens d'origines diverses, une communauté privilégiée, administrée par un naqib tlemcenien. L'activité commerciale de la ville décline alors au profit de la ville d'Oran.\nD'après Kamel Kateb, à l’instar d’autres villes algériennes, Tlemcen a connu un déclin de sa population indigène, et ce n’est qu’en 1891 qu'elle a retrouvé son effectif de 1830. La population évolue sur toute la période de la colonisation de 5 000 habitants en 1842 à 73 000 habitants en 1954 et 82 500 habitants en 1960. Dans les années 1920, la population comprenait environ 30 000 musulmans, 6 000 juifs et 4 000 européens.\n\nCependant, la colonisation bouleverse moins la structure sociale de la ville qu'elle ne l'a fait dans la plupart des autres villes algériennes, la bourgeoisie locale ayant participé à l'évolution urbaine de cette période. La proportion des Européens est toujours restée relativement faible par rapport aux autres villes algériennes de même taille. De toutes les villes de l'Ouest oranais, Tlemcen est celle qui a été la moins pénétrée par l'immigration espagnole ; la limite de cet exode ibérique du milieu du XIXe siècle semble avoir été la région d'El Malah (Rio Salado), Sidi Bel Abbès et Béni Saf. Au début du XXe siècle, les premiers nadis se sont formés : le cercle kouloughli « jeunes Algériens » en 1910 et le cercle hadri « Nadi Islami » en 1912, les deux seront débordés à la génération suivante par le cercle « Nadi Sa’ada ».\nLa colonisation française a provoqué la disparation des deux tiers de la ville intra-muros ainsi que la destruction de certains monuments dans le cadre d'« aménagements » :\n\nle palais El Mechouar, aménagé en poste militaire ;\nla porte Bab El Key'yis, édifice monumental encadré par deux tours carrées avec une troisième de style zianide, circulaire au centre de la terrasse, possédant un double accès intérieur et extérieur à trois arcs avec couleurs ;\nla médersa Tachfinia, édifiée au XIVe siècle, détruite durant les années 1870 ;\nla médersa El Yaqoûbia ;\nle quartier commercial de la Qissaria remplacé par un marché couvert en 1904 ;\nla forteresse, symbole de l'époque zianide, qui alignait dix tours carrées ;\nune ancienne maison mauresque et son jardin remplacée par la caserne Mustapha ;\nun tiers de la ville remplacé par la caserne Gourmala ;\nles deux places du fondouk et de la mosquée déstructurées en 1887 ;\nla mosquée Sidi al-Hasan ;\nla mosquée Sidi al-Halawi transformée en musée.\n\nIndépendance\nLa communauté juive, ayant eu son lot d'attentats et d'exactions, quitte Tlemcen en 1962, 8 000 personnes rejoignant Marseille. L'indépendance de l'Algérie s'accompagne de la ségrégation ethnique et du départ d'une partie de la population tlemcenienne vers Alger, Oran et Sidi Bel Abbès. Conjointement, un afflux de population d'origine rurale s'est fixé à Tlemcen.\n\nDémographie\nÉvolutions\nSelon le recensement général de la population et de l'habitat de 2008, la population de la commune de Tlemcen est évaluée à 140 158 habitants contre 96 028 en 1977 :\n\nPyramide des âges\nLa pyramide des âges montre, en 2008, une importante population jeune : plus de la moitié de la population de la cité a moins de 30 ans. Cependant, on observe une diminution des naissances à partir de 1988 avant une reprise de natalité sur la période 2004-2008.\n\nÉducation\nFidèle à son passé, Tlemcen accueille plusieurs écoles et collèges renommés tels que la medersa Tachfinia aujourd'hui disparue, la médersa Khaldouniya, la médersa d'El-Eubbad, etc.\nTlemcen a été l'une des trois villes de l'Algérie française à abriter un lycée franco-musulman, institution originale qui combine une formation en arabe à un cursus secondaire en français. Il en est sorti de nombreux diplômés qui ont joué un rôle important dans le combat pour l'indépendance, puis dans le jeune État algérien, tels que des ministres, des patrons de sociétés publiques et des directeurs d'administration. Les Tlemcéniens passés par ce lycée et par le collège Slane, une autre institution, ont longtemps occupé les postes-clés en dehors de l'armée et des services de sécurité.\nSur la période 1974-1980, l'enseignement supérieur est assuré au sein d'un centre universitaire qui regroupe à l'origine les seuls troncs communs des sciences exactes et de la biologie ; il s'est graduellement étendu à de nouvelles filières. L'université Abou Bekr Belkaid est créée par un décret de 1989, modifié et complété par les décrets de 1995 et 1998. Elle se compose de huit facultés réparties autour de pôles principaux, notamment l'Imama et Chetouane.\n\nCulture\nTlemcen nous évoque aujourd'hui encore la capitale de l'Algérie indépendante au Moyen âge et une métropole prestigieuse. Elle a toujours été un centre religieux, culturel, intellectuel et architectural important. À l'époque islamique, elle est l'une des cités du Maghreb les plus propices à la création et à l'épanouissement intellectuel et son influence sera grande dans tout l'Occident musulman. Située au carrefour des routes qui mènent du Maroc à l'Algérie et de la mer Méditerranée au Sahara, Tlemcen joue un rôle culturel et commercial important.\nElle a maintenu les coutumes, les fêtes religieuses et, en général, toutes les cérémonies publiques et privées dans leur cadre ancien. Ainsi, Yennayer, la fête du jour de l'an berbère héritée de l'époque berbère pré-islamique, est toujours célébrée à Tlemcen.\nLa scène culturelle est animée par ses bibliothèques, ses centres culturels, son musée, ses théâtres et ses associations. La cité accueille en 2011 l'événement « Tlemcen, capitale de la culture islamique ».\n\nLes échanges intellectuels avec Béjaïa sont aussi très importants, en théologie comme en musique, les deux villes ont toujours gardé un lien d'échanges que l'on constate dans les chansons de style arabo-andalou de Cheikh Sadek El Béjaoui. Ces deux grandes villes de la période islamique ont joué un rôle important dans l'instruction et l'enseignement des personnes du haut rang intellectuel tels que Sidi Boumediene, Yahia et Abderrahmane Ibn Khaldoun, etc. Au XIe siècle et au XIIIe siècle, les Tlemcéniens se sont rendus à Béjaïa, au XIVe siècle et au XVe siècle c'était le tour des Bougiotes afin de créer cette symbiose qui était un temps une tradition scientifique du Maghreb.\n\nMusique\nTlemcen est un des berceaux de la musique andalouse.\nTlemcen est un centre important et est un des berceaux de la musique arabo-andalouse : de nombreux artistes de ce genre musical sont originaires de cette cité. Cette musique est étroitement associée à la vie tlemcèniene depuis la légende de Ziriab et de son luth d'argent. Du fait de son ancien statut de jumelle arabe de Grenade, elle a su préserver et développer la forme musicale arabo-andalouse de style gharnati.\nTlemcen est également le berceau du hawzi, un autre genre musical qui découle de la musique andalouse (dont le musicien-poète du XVIIe siècle, Ben Messaîb est un représentant) et du hawfi, un genre poétique féminin. Le Festival national de musique hawzi est ainsi organisé à Tlemcen.\nLe chant féminin est présent avec plusieurs versions originales : Cheikhate, Moussamiâte et f'qirate.\nL'allaoui, une autre des musiques de Tlemcen et de sa région (Nedroma, Maghnia, Ghazaouet, Sebdou, MSirda Fouaga, etc.), était jouée et dansée par les guerriers berbères.\n\nMusées\nLe musée de Tlemcen est situé dans l'ancienne médersa de Tlemcen inaugurée en 1905 et dont l'architecture a été inspirée de l'art musulman. Il comporte des collections d'archéologie musulmane, d'antiquités constituées essentiellement de pierres tombales romaines de Pomaria (Tlemcen), Altava (Ouled Mimoun) et Numerus Sirurum (Maghnia) et d'objets préhistoriques provenant principalement de la région mais aussi de certaines villes du Sud du pays comme Tindouf et Adrar. Le musée a connu une extension dans le cadre de la manifestation culturelle « Tlemcen 2011, capitale de la culture islamique ».\nLe musée national d'art et d'histoire de Tlemcen, inauguré en 2009, a été aménagé dans l'ancienne mairie de Tlemcen située au centre-ville et qui a été entièrement restaurée. D'une superficie de 2 000 m2, il est doté de plusieurs salles d'exposition et de deux laboratoires. Il est consacré à la présentation des arts de la civilisation islamique, de certaines dynasties qui se sont succédé au Maghreb, telles que les Zianides et les Almohades.\nLe musée Moudjahid a ouvert ses portes en janvier 2011. Construit dans le style hispano-mauresque, il est géré par le Ministère des Moudjahidines. Consacré à la Wilaya V (Oranie) pendant la guerre d'Algérie, il présente divers documents historiques concernant la lutte pour l'indépendance nationale, dont une collection de photos des « martyrs de la Révolution » dans la région de Tlemcen mais aussi des documents sur la résistance populaire et la lutte nationale pendant toute la période coloniale.\n\nMonuments et sites\nPlusieurs de ses monuments font référence en matière d'architecture hispano-mauresque.\n\nLa Grande Mosquée de Tlemcen, datant de 1136, est le dernier vestige d'architecture almoravide en Algérie avec la Grande Mosquée de Nedroma et la Grande Mosquée d'Alger, avant un minaret datant de la période zianide. L'ornementation du mihrab rappelle celle de la Grande Mosquée de Cordoue. La salle de prière de la mosquée, construite vers 1082, reçoit en 1136 des embellissements révélant l'influence andalouse.\nLa mosquée Sidi Boumediene, située dans la médina d'El Eubbad, un piton rocheux dominant la plaine de Tlemcen, est édifiée par le sultan mérinide Aboul Hassan appelé « Sultan Noir » au XIVe siècle. Elle fait partie d'un complexe qui comprend également une médersa jouxtant la koubba où est inhumé Abou Madyane. Elle fait de ce site l'un des sanctuaires de l'art hispano-mauresque.\nLa mosquée de Sidi Bellahsen, petit sanctuaire édifié par le sultan abdelwadide Othman en 1296, abrite le musée de la ville. Le grand bassin est creusé par le sultan Abû Tâshfîn. La mosquée de Sidi al-Halwi située au nord de la ville, est consacrée à un autre andalou, Sidi al-Halwi.\nDu palais El Mechouar des souverains abdelwadides a connu des travaux de restauration, afin d'en faire un espace culturel. De même, de la ville mérinide du XIVe siècle, la Mansourah, située dans les faubourgs occidentaux de la ville, il ne reste que des pans de murailles rosés courant au milieu des oliveraies et un minaret dressé dans la campagne.\nParmi les trente portes historiques de le médina, les seuls vestiges qui subsistent sont ceux de Bab el-Hdid (porte du Fer) au sud, Bab el-khemis (porte du jeudi) à l'ouest et Bab el-Qarmadin au nord ; cette dernière a été le théâtre d'une tentative de meurtre contre Yaghmoracen par le chef de sa garde chrétienne. Il existe également des vestiges des anciens remparts d'Agādīr et de Tāgrārt.\nLe tombeau de la princesse, appelé ainsi parce qu'on y a retrouvé l'épitaphe d'une princesse (descendante de Yaghmoracen) morte en 1412 et celle d'une femme de sang royal, est une kouba construite en briques sur un plan octogonal, le bois sacré de Sidi Yakoub se situe à proximité.\nLe hammam al-sabaghîn (hammam des teinturiers) est un bain de type arabe avec des caractéristiques hispano-mauresques.\n\nLittérature\nLe roman La Grande Maison de Mohammed Dib retrace la vie quotidienne des musulmans de Tlemcen dans l'Algérie de 1939. L'histoire se déroule dans une maison collective où s'entassent plusieurs familles et dont le héros est un petit garçon d'une dizaine d'années. Le roman a été adapté à la télévision algérienne sous forme de feuilletons.\n\nCostume traditionnel\nLes habitants de la ville de Tlemcen, au riche passé ont montré et montrent encore un goût très raffiné pour l'habillement. C'est au XVIe siècle que l'art du costume sous l'influence ottomane atteint son apogée dans la cité. Tlemcen, qui fut longtemps un centre d'échanges et de productions, devait surtout sa renommée à la fabrication de tapis et de tissages de laine, entrant dans la confection des haïk et des burnous ainsi que dans la sellerie brodée. Au cours de l'âge d'or de la ville entre le XIIIe siècle et le XVe siècle (alors capitale des Zianides), des tisserands, tailleurs, brodeurs et bijoutiers, produisaient des soieries, des laines et des bijoux, parmi les plus recherchés du Maghreb.\nMalgré le déclin des industries textiles locales au XXe siècle, l'art de tisser le mensouj, un luxueux tissu à rayures doré ou argenté fait à la main, et l'art de broder des caftans et des coiffes en velours brodées, persistent encore aujourd'hui. La Tlemcénienne est restée la plus traditionaliste des femmes d'Algérie. Parmi les costumes citadins algériens, seul celui de Tlemcen réussit à sauvegarder l'ensemble de ses composantes anciennes.\nSon costume féminine rassemble un ensemble unique de costumes dans lesquels des éléments d'origines différentes fusionnent, créant un mélange hybride de styles :\n\nle rda, est un péplos drapé d'origine berbère en soies légères unies ou fleuries ;\nle karakou, veste ajustée en velours brodé de fils dorés et argentés, est un costume algérois adopté par les femmes de Tlemcen. La variante locale se distingue de celui d’Alger par la présence d'une jupe en mensouj à la place du sarouel ;\nla blousa, descendante de la tunique médiévale abaya puis transformée au début du XXe siècle en une robe longue à manches courte ;\nla chedda de Tlemcen ou lebset el-arftan (« la tenue du caftan) », est l'élément le plus riche et le plus cher du costume de cérémonie de Tlemcen. Il est composé d'un manteau de velours droit et court, appelé arftan, brodé de motifs dorés ou argentés qui est porté sur une blousa traditionnelle en tissu mensouj. Elle se compose également d'un fouta et sa ceinture hzam, un voile court en tulle posé sur une coiffe conique (chechiya) en velours richement brodée, et d'une parure complexe.\nLa chedda de Tlemcen est inscrite au patrimoine culturel immatériel de l'humanité depuis 2012.\nL'homme revêtait le haïk, le burnous, la kachabia (une longue tunique), la 'abia (même modèle en soie). Au XIVe siècle, Ibn Khaldoun mentionne que les haïks et les burnous de Tlemcen sont les plus recherchés sur les marchés d'Orient et d'Occident. A ces premières pièces vinrent s'ajouter la chemise (qmedja), la veste de drap ou de toile (ghlila), les gilets sans manches (mqafel), le sarouel et la djellaba.\nL'hiver, l'homme ajoutait le burnous, comme de nos jours. Ce burnous pouvait être de drap de laine d'agneau noir (khidous) ou de laine brune en poil de chameau (oûbar). Il mettait un autre burnous, de qualité, en laine blanche bouclée (mah'arbel), fabriqué à Tlemcen. En été, le burnous de laine était remplacé par un burnous léger, à la campagne, par la djellaba, elle aussi tissée à Tlemcen et faite de laine blanche grise ou rayée de brun et blanc. Le citadin préfère la gandoura blanche. Aujourd'hui, elle est également faite de drap, de gabardine de soie ou de laine pure, elle peut être de ton beige, marron, bleu foncé ou gris.\n\n« Tlemcen 2011, capitale de la culture islamique »\nTlemcen a obtenu en 2011 le statut de capitale de la culture islamique pour la région arabe aux côtés de Nouakchott. Cette manifestation s'accompagne par plusieurs opérations, telles que la restauration de tous les sites et monuments historiques classés au patrimoine national, notamment les mosquées, le palais El Mechouar et le complexe religieux de Sidi Boumediene, et l'initiation d'un plan de restauration et de préservation pour la vieille médina.\nEn outre, il était prévu la réalisation de quatre musées consacrés à l'art et à l'histoire, à la numismatique, aux manuscrits et aux arts traditionnels, d'un musée des cultures populaires à Beni Snous et d'un centre d'études andalouses.\nCette manifestation culturelle est marquée par plusieurs festivals et des semaines culturelles des pays islamiques, que présentent les 49 États membres de l'Organisation islamique pour l'éducation, les sciences et la culture. À cela s'ajoutent des semaines culturelles des 48 wilayas du pays qui sont axées sur le patrimoine islamique ainsi que sur les arts du récit et de la parole dans chaque wilaya.\nUne dizaine d'expositions sont aussi organisées sur des thèmes tels que les relations historiques entre Tlemcen et l'Andalousie, l'échange Béjaïa-Tlemcen, Bachir Yellès, etc. Cette manifestation est aussi l'occasion de doter la ville et sa région d'infrastructures culturelles et de faire rayonner l'image de l'Algérie, de son histoire et de son peuple.\n\nÉconomie\nAprès l'indépendance, les relations de Tlemcen avec Oran se sont renforcées dans le domaine des échanges de biens. Mais la ville n'était pas avantagée par la politique économique algérienne, même si l'intégration à l'économie nationale s'est renforcée. Tlemcen a su organiser autour de sa wilaya un réseau qui s'appuie sur un ensemble de villes : Sebdou, Remchi, Nedroma et Maghnia ; il a permis le développement des activités industrielles et commerciales de la ville et le drainage des revenus agricoles à son profit.\nLa ville abrite diverses unités industrielles : huileries, tanneries, filatures et tissages de la soie, usines d’enfûtage de gaz, fabrique de matériel téléphonique.\nDepuis les années 2000, la ville connaît un boom immobilier et réalise de grands travaux. Cependant, elle souffre toujours du chômage et du marché noir.\n\nArtisanat\nTlemcen est une vieille ville artisanale. La fabrication du tapis, qui était considérée comme l'un des métiers artisanaux les plus réputés, a constitué durant les années 1960 et 1970 un véritable moteur de la tapisserie locale : Tlemcen exportait des milliers de tapis vers des pays étrangers, notamment vers la France et l'Allemagne. Le secteur a cependant vécu une régression sensible au cours des décennies suivantes, due essentiellement à la cherté des matières premières et des contraintes de commercialisation, notamment vers l'étranger.\nTlemcen est aussi réputée pour la confection des habits traditionnels féminins. Chaque quartier est connu pour sa spécialité, le métier prédominant ayant donné son appellation au quartier et ruelles qu'il occupe. Ces métiers ont connu une régression même si, depuis les années 2000, l'État encourage la formation professionnelle dans ce domaine par l'ouverture de plusieurs branches et spécialités artisanales et la mise en place de mécanismes pour promouvoir la création de micro-entreprises.\n\nTourisme\nLa wilaya de Tlemcen compte 45 sites naturels et historiques classé par le ministère de la culture algérien, vingt sites et monuments sont situés à la commune : Honaïne, les mosquées almoravides de Tlemcen et Nedroma, Abou Madyane, la médersa d'El-Eubbad, la mosquée de Sidi Bellahsen, la mosquée de Sidi El Haloui, le palais El Mechouar, les villages de Tlata et Zahra, la mosquée de Beni Snous, les ruines de Mansourah, le sanctuaire du Rabb, les grottes d'Aïn Fezza, Bab El Qarmadin, le minaret d'Agadir, le plateau de Lalla Setti, etc.\nParmi les sites touristiques, on peut citer :\n\nle plateau de Lalla Setti : plateau équipé d'aires de jeux et de détente qui domine la ville et offre un panorama sur la cité et ses alentours, il abrite la koubba de Lalla Setti ;\nle tombeau du rabbin Ephraim Encaoua : lieu de pèlerinage pour la communauté juive de Tlemcen ;\nles cascades : lieu de promenade et de baignade pour les Tlemcéniens avec « Le Gouffre » (El Ourit), nom de l'oued Mefrouch lors de sa chute en bassins successifs vers l'oued Safsaf ;\nles grottes d'Aïn Fezza : trois salles souterraines garnies de stalactites et stalagmites.\nÀ l'hiver très froid, neigeux en raison de l'altitude (plus de 800 m) mais ensoleillé, succède un printemps précoce qui fait éclore dès le mois de février, les fleurs de cerisiers et de pêchers. Dans ce contexte, la célèbre Fête des cerises attire à Tlemcen des dizaines de milliers de visiteurs[réf. nécessaire].\n\nVie quotidienne\nSports\nTlemcen a eu des clubs sportifs durant la période coloniale notamment à partir des années 1930 lorsque fut créée la Jeunesse Sportive Musulmane de Tlemcen (JSMT) par un groupe de jeunes tlemceniens nationalistes en 1937. Plus tard, la JSMT fusionnera avec l'Union Sportive Franco-Musulmane de Tlemcen (USFAT) pour fomer le Racing Club de Tlemcen (RCT) en 1956 en pleine guerre de libération nationale. Les jeunes tlemceniens ont montré leur fidélité a la JSMT qui renaitra apres l'indépendance, notamment sous l'impulsion de Chouaib Bekhechi et ses compagnons qui étaient déjà parmi les fondateurs du club en 1937. Mais c'est le WAT qui sera le club sportif dominant depuis l'indépendance de l'Algérie à nos jours. Le complexe sportif Akid Lotfi, situé à Birouana et d'une capacité de 25 000 places, est l'infrastructure sportive la plus importante de la wilaya de Tlemcen. Le complexe a bénéficié de travaux d'aménagement entre 2003 et 2008.\nLe Widad Amel Tlemcen, domicilié au complexe sportif, est le club de football de la ville ; il a évolué longtemps en Ligue 1 professionnelle, décrochant au passage 2 coupes d’Algérie en 1998 et en 2002. Le basket-ball connaît un regain d'activité dans la ville grâce à la création en 2003 d'une section au sein de l'association du complexe sportif qui vise à revivre les performances du Club sportif de Tlemcen actif durant les années 1970.\nLe secteur sportif s'est par ailleurs renforcé par la réalisation en 2010 d'un stade d'athlétisme sur les hauteurs de la ville, au plateau de Lalla Setti. Cette infrastructure est destinée à la préparation d'athlètes professionnels ainsi qu'à la vulgarisation de la pratique de plusieurs disciplines liées à l'athlétisme.\nLa ville se dote aussi d'un aéro-club en 1974. Relancé en 1999, il forme du personnel navigant et non navigant pour les sports aériens.\n\nSanté\nTlemcen dispose d'une dizaine de cliniques et d'un centre hospitalo-universitaire (CHU) réalisé dans les années 1950 et d'une capacité de 800 lits. Un nouveau CHU de 400 lits sera réalisé dans la commune de Chetouane.\n\nParcs et jardins\nLe parc national de Tlemcen créé en 1993, est l’un des parcs les plus récents d’Algérie. Il s'étend sur sept communes, principalement : Tlemcen, Mansourah et Aïn Fezza. Il protège d’importants vestiges archéologiques, des sites historiques et des monuments de grande valeur de la région de Tlemcen, à l'instar du complexe religieux d'El Eubbad, composé de la mosquée de Sidi- Boumediene et de son mausolée, de Dar Soltane, des ruines de Mansourah. Le parc de Tlemcen recèle aussi d'autres sites naturels : les cascades d'El Ourit, les grottes de Beni Add (commune d'Ain Fezza), les forêts d’Ifri, Zariffet et Aïn Fezza. Le parc comporte des zones humides qui accueillent, à chaque saison, des milliers d'oiseaux migrateurs. Le parc compte aussi plusieurs espèces rares ou en voie de disparition dont l'aigle royal, la genette, la belette, le porcs-épics et le caméléon. Le parc représente une perspective d’extension potentielle qui consiste à l'intégration de nouveaux sites naturels et touristiques dans « le patrimoine du Parc national ».\nLe plateau de Lalla Setti situé à plus de 1 000 mètres d'altitude, surplombe la ville de Tlemcen. Ce site naturel a été aménagé pour devenir une destination touristique très fréquenté par les Tlemcéniens. Le plateau s'est transformé en un vaste espace de villégiature pour les familles et les touristes nationaux, il s'est doté de diverses infrastructures de divertissement. La mise en fonction d'un téléphérique moderne a rendu le site plus accessible. Dans le parc, une koubba, qui abrite les restes de Lalla Setti (une héroïne du grand siège de Tlemcen) est un mausolée très visité par les femmes. Selon une croyance locale, les femmes stériles déposent leurs ceintures dans l'espoir d'avoir des enfants. Le site comporte aussi la forêt du Petit perdreau, fréquentée par les randonneurs.\nLa ville est dotée de plusieurs jardins dont ceux de sa banlieue situés entre les collines d'El-Kalaâ et El-Eubbad, le jardin expérimental d'El-Hartoun, semblable en dimension réduite, à celui d'El-Hamma (Alger) et le jardin du grand bassin, connu sous le nom de « Sahridj M'beda », dont les contours en profondeur furent édifiés au XIVe siècle par le roi zianide Abû Tâshfîn.\n\nLes mariages à Tlemcen\n\nÀ Tlemcen, les anciens attachaient beaucoup d'importance au lien unissant deux familles à l'occasion d'un mariage. S'il durait quatorze jours dans le passé, soit sept jours de préparatifs et sept jours pour les cérémonies de mariage, il ne dure plus que trois jours.\nLe premier est consacré à la soirée des fiançailles, cérémonie qui officialise l'union à travers la bague et la hana (corbeille remplie de friandises disposées sur des feuilles de henné). Le second s'articule autour de la cérémonie de mariage elle-même. Les amis et la famille du mari forment un cortège pour amener la mariée et la « sortir » de chez elle ; ce cortège se fait à dos de cheval, généralement blanc pour le marié qui porte un burnous de la même couleur, tandis que la mariée est habillé d'une chedda, enveloppé d'un haïk, symbole de pudeur et de noblesse. La fête du mariage se déroule dans la soirée, avec un dîner et différents gâteaux traditionnels préparés pour l'occasion et accompagnés du son de la musique andalouse et du houzi jouée par un orchestre. Le troisième jour, au lendemain du mariage, un déjeuner est préparé en honneur de la belle-famille.\n\n\n== Relations internationales ==",

          "content": "Mansoura (Arabic: المنصورة; Al Manṣūra, IPA: [el.mɑnˈsˤuːɾɑ], rural: [el.mænˈsˤuːɾe]) is a city in Egypt located on the eastern bank of the Damietta branch of the Nile river. The city is the capital of the Dakahlia Governorate and has an estimated population of 632,330 as of 2023.\n\nEtymology\nMansoura in Arabic means \"victorious\". The city is named after the El Mansoura Battle (1250) against Louis IX of France during the Seventh Crusade.\n\nHistory\nMansoura was established in 1219 by al-Kamil of the Ayyubid dynasty upon a Phatmetic branch of the Nile on a place of several older villages like Al-Bishtamir (Arabic: البشطمير) and Kafr al-Badamas (Arabic: كفر البدماص, from Ancient Greek: ποταμός, \"river, canal\"). After the Egyptians defeated the Crusaders during the Seventh Crusade, it was named Mansoura (aka. \"The Victorious\").\nIn the Seventh Crusade, the Capetians were defeated and put to flight; between fifteen and thirty thousand of their men fell on the battlefield. Louis IX of France was captured in the main Battle of Fariskur, and confined in the house of Ibrahim Ibn Lokman, secretary of the sultan, and under the guard of the eunuch Sobih. The king's brother was imprisoned in the same house. The sultan provided for their sustenance. The house of Ibrahim Ibn Lokman is now the only museum in Mansoura. It is open to the public and houses articles that used to belong to the French monarch, including his personal thirteenth century toilet.\nThe Mansoura Air Battle on October 14, 1973, occurred during the Yom Kippur War. Israeli Air Force fighters attacking Egyptian air bases were intercepted by the Egyptian Air Force. On that day, 160 jet fighters, most belonging to Israel, battled for 53 minutes over Mansoura. The Egyptian army claimed that despite the numerical and qualitative superiority of the Israeli warplanes, 17 Israeli planes were downed. (2 according to the Israelis), while the rest retreated. Egypt announced the loss of six planes, only three of which fell to Israeli fire. The Egyptian government subsequently changed the country's \"Air Force Day\" from November 2 to October 14, to commemorate the Mansoura Air Battle.\n\nGeography\nLocation\nMansoura lies on the east bank of the Damietta branch of the Nile, in the Delta region. Mansoura is about 120 km northeast of Cairo. Across from the city, on the opposite bank of the Nile, is the town of Talkha.\n\nClimate\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh).\n\nCulture\nThe Egyptian Arabic dialect spoken by Mansoura's population is a northern Egyptian Arabic dialect, with noticeable influences from the city's surrounding rural villages, each of which has contributed to the city's population over the years. There are some similarities to Alexandrian Egyptian Arabic in some aspects of pronunciation.\nMansoura National Museum used to be Dar Ibn Lockman, the house where Louis IX was imprisoned in 1250 during the Seventh Crusade. Displayed in the museum are the suits of mail and swords of the crusaders, as well as a collection of maps. Huge paintings depict the Battle of Mansoura.\nThe Mansoura branch of the National Library was inaugurated in 2008 as the Mansoura Misr Library.\nMansoura is famous for its architectural style, especially the Shinnawi Palace (after Mohamed Bek El-Shinnawi, a member of the Wafd Party). It was built by an Italian architect in 1928. The mosque of El-Saleh Ayoub El-Kebir is one of the most important in Mansoura. It was built by a loyal servant of the Sultan and is located in Al-Sagha Street that separates \"Old Mansoura\" from the modern city.\nLike Cairo, Alexandria and Port Said, Mansoura was home to a flourishing Greek community until the Nasser era, when many were forced to leave. Many of the older and best established shops and businesses around the city still bear their original Greek names. Mansoura also had a small Italian population living in the city too. The first Old English school in the city was established on the site of the old Greek school in the Toriel area, one of the traditionally relatively affluent residential districts of the city.\n\nEducation\nThe University of Mansoura was founded in 1962, initially as a branch of Cairo University. The Urology and Nephrology center of Mansoura University founded by Prof Mohammed Ghonem is considered to be the best kidney center in the Middle East and Africa.\nMansoura has a sports stadium (Mansoura Stadium) which is home to its football team.\n\nClubs (Sport)\nGezert Elward Sport Club: It is located directly on the Nile and has tennis courts, swimming, gymnastics, squash and social club. Recently, the gymnastics team participated under the seven-year club in the Republic Championship and received 2 gold medals 13 silver and 1 bronze and 1 participation.\nMansoura Sports Club: It has an official football field.\nMansoura Sports Stadium: It has an official football field, swimming pool, social club and many sports facilities.\nThe Olympic Village (Mansoura University Stadium): It covers an area of 15 acres and is open to university students, faculty members and those wishing to play abroad in individual and group games.\nNile Club: The club was established by decision of the University Council in its session held on 12/27/1993, provided that it has financial, administrative and technical resignation, and it is located in Rose Island in the lower walkway in Mansoura. The club is a cultural, social, sports and recreational center for faculty members, their assistants, and university staff.\n\nNotable people\nKareem Abu-Elmagd, Egyptian-American organ transplant surgeon\nAhmed El-Ghandour (Da7ee7), YouTuber and educator\nAdel Emam, actor\nMohamed Ghoneim, urologist\nFaten Hamama, actress\nAhmed Hamdi, engineer\nAhmed Hamed, Olympic pentathlete\nAnis Mansour; writer\nHassan El-Imam, film director, titled Box-office King\nGad al-Haq Ali Gad al-Haq, Grand Imam of Al-Azhar from 1982 to 1996; public figure and Islamic scholar\nPope Tawadros II, Pope of Alexandria & Patriarch of All Africa on the Holy Apostolic See of Saint Mark the Evangelist of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria\nIbrahim Salah; footballer\nHesham Sallam, paleontologist\nSoheir Zaki, dancer\n\nSee also\nList of cities and towns in Egypt\nCentral Library - Mansoura University Archived 2023-06-12 at the Wayback Machine\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\"Mansura\" .

          "content": "The Great Mosque of Tlemcen (Arabic: الجامع الكبير لتلمسان, romanized: el-Jemaa el-Kebir litilimcen) is a mosque in Tlemcen, Algeria. It was founded and first built in 1082 CE, and modified and embellished several times afterwards. It is considered one of the most important examples of architecture under the Almoravid dynasty. Major extensions to the mosque building and the construction of the minaret were completed during the Zayyanid era.\n\nHistory\nThe mosque was founded by the Almoravid emir Yusuf ibn Tashfin in 1082 when he founded the city of Tagrart (present-day Tlemcen), an extension of the earlier Idrisid-era city of Agadir. However, the mosque was renovated and decorated by his son and successor, Ali ibn Yusuf. Among other things, the celebrated dome near the mosque's mihrab dates from this renovation, which an inscription below the dome indicates was completed in 1136 CE. Curiously, however, the actual name of the emir has been erased from the inscription, possibly by the Almohads who ruled the city after the Almoravids. It is also believed that the old Almoravid palace of the city, the Qasr al-Qadima or Qasr al-Bali (\"Old Palace\"), directly adjoined the mosque on its northwestern side.\nIn 1236 CE Sultan Yaghmorasan (r. 1236–1283), the founder of the Abdalwadid dynasty of Tlemcen, added the mosque's minaret near its courtyard. Yaghmorasan also modified the areas around the courtyard and extended the mosque structure northwards. The original mosque likely had a larger rectangular courtyard whose position and proportions would have been similar to the courtyards of earlier mosques in Al-Andalus, whereas Yaghmorasan's modifications left the mosque with a square courtyard whose middle axis is no longer aligned with the middle axis of the mosque. The less ornate dome in the middle of the prayer hall today probably also dates from this time.\nNext to the mosque there used to be an Islamic court (Mahkama) and an Islamic university. In 1875, during French colonial control, the mosque was declared, along with other major monuments of the city, a \"Historic Monument\" and placed under certain protective measures. Around the same time, French architects carried out the first modern repairs, restorations, and studies of the mosque.\n\nArchitecture\nThe floor plan of the mosque is approximately 50 by 60 metres (160 by 200 feet) deep. Although the mosque is designed for a typical rectangular floor plan, the northwestern corner of the mosque is truncated because of the original presence of a palace on this side. Like most North African mosques, its has a hypostyle prayer hall and an internal courtyard (sahn).\nThe prayer hall is divided into 13 naves or aisles by 12 rows of horseshoe arches running perpendicular to the southeastern qibla wall. Two transverse rows of arches – one on the south side of the courtyard and another about halfway between the courtyard and the qibla wall – also feature polylobed arches, and another polylobed arch runs transversally before the bay in front of the mihrab (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer).\n\nThe central aisle in front of the mihrab is wider than the other aisles. At this aisle's middle point, in front of the second row of transverse arches, is an ornamental ribbed dome, likely added by Yaghmorasan in the 13th century. Another ornamental dome, older and more intricate, covers the bay in front of the mihrab. Some of the arch pillars near the mihrab also feature marble columns. The mihrab itself is an alcove in the wall which opens through a horseshoe arch framed by intricate carved stucco decoration. The overall design of the mihrab follows the architectural precedents seen in the mihrab of the Great Mosque of Cordoba.\nThe intricate ribbed dome in front of the mihrab is considered a highlight of Almoravid architecture and dates to the renovation of Ali ibn Yusuf. The structure of the dome is strictly ornamental, consisting of multiple ribs or intersecting arches forming a twelve-pointed star pattern. It is also partly see-through, allowing some outside light to filter through a screen of pierced and carved arabesque and openwork decoration that fills the spaces between the ribs. The area below this dome, the maqsura, was once separated from the rest of the mosque by a richly-crafted wooden lattice screen. The screen has since been moved to the Museum of Art and History in Tlemcen. It bears an inscription dating it to 1138, also around the time of Ali ibn Yusuf's renovation.\nThe original Almoravid mosque presumably had no minaret, as the current minaret was only added in 1236 by Yaghmorasan. The minaret is made of brick and has a typical square floor plan, measuring 6.3 metres (21 feet) per side. It has a two-tiered shaft: the main shaft is 26.2 metres (86 feet) tall and a secondary lantern tower above this brings the total height to 29.15 metres (95.6 feet) meters. The four facades of the main shaft of the minaret are decorated with carved panels of sebka motifs springing from engaged columns below. An odd detail is the fact that the decorative panel on the courtyard side is uneven: the space between the engaged columns on the left is wider than the others, causing an uneven spacing within the sebka pattern above it as well. The top of the minaret was formerly crowned with an Arabic inscription made in copper, the pieces of which were moved to a local museum before 1903.\n\nChandelier\nSuspended from the ribbed dome in the center of the prayer hall is a large circular chandelier. By popular tradition, its origin is attributed to a donation by Yaghmorasan in the 13th century. William and Georges Marçais speculated that it could be a work of Andalusi origin. Archeologist Lucien Golvin suggested that it was of slightly later date, possibly a spoil from the abandoned Marinid mosque of al-Mansura (beginning of the 14th century), where Ibn Marzuq described a chandelier that he had made and that had been moved to the Great Mosque of Tlemcen. The largest and lowest part of the chandelier had a circumference of around 8 metres (26 ft) and was made of cedar wood clad with sheets of copper that were pierced with floral motifs. In the 19th century, the chandelier had fallen into disrepair. Its remains were moved to a local museum and a replacement inside the mosque was created in the 20th century by Mohammed ben Kalfate, a metalworker and artisan from Tlemcen.\n\nInfluences and architectural legacy\nAntonio Almagro, in an analysis of the mosque's architecture, has argued that its original shape and proportions were similar to those of major mosques in Al-Andalus such as the Great Mosque of Cordoba but that this parallel is now somewhat obscured by later modifications to the mosque. The celebrated ornamental dome and elaborate decoration added to the mosque by Ali ibn Yusuf, however, is considered exceptional and an important testimony of Almoravid craftsmanship which has rarely survived elsewhere. The design of the mosque's ornamental dome traces its origins to the 10th-century ribbed domes of the Great Mosque of Cordoba and subsequent domes in Al-Andalus, and in turn it inspired similar ornate domes in the Great Mosque of Fes el-Jdid and the Great Mosque of Taza, both built in the later Marinid period. Almagro and others see further parallels between the mosque's features and the decorative features found in the architecture of the Taifas period in Al-Andalus, notably with the Aljaferia palace of Zaragoza. Indeed, there are historical reports of a former room (now vanished) in the Aljaferia whose vaulted ceiling had openwork decoration reminiscent of the mosque's openwork dome, although the remains of decoration in the palace today suggest it was less delicate and subtle than the mosque's dome.\nJonathan Bloom remarks that the evidence simply suggests that the Almoravids, especially at the height of their power and culture under Ali ibn Yusuf, could afford to import craftsmen from Al-Andalus to work on their new monuments in North Africa. The increased ornamental complexity and sophistication of subsequent Maghrebi architecture, influenced by Andalusi architecture, is thus in part due to this Almoravid patronage. Bloom also notes that although we know the Almoravids built many other mosques, few examples of their architecture have survived, and therefore the Great Mosque of Tlemcen may not have been as \"original\" in its time as it appears now and its exceptional features today may have existed in other mosques that have now disappeared. The Almoravid expansion of the Qarawiyyin Mosque, for example, shows even more elaborate decoration overall than the Tlemcen mosque, although using different elements.\n\nSee also\nIslam in Algeria\nList of mosques in Algeria\nHistory of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Great Mosque of Tlemcen at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"Djama'a al-Kebir (Great Mosque)\" (Includes pictures of the interior and the floor plan).

          "content": "Constantine (Arabic: قسنطينة, romanized: Qusanṭīnah), also spelled Qacentina or Kasantina, is the capital of Constantine Province in northeastern Algeria. During Roman times it was called Cirta and was renamed \"Constantina\" in honour of Emperor Constantine the Great. Located somewhat inland, Constantine is about 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the Mediterranean coast, on the banks of the Rhumel River.\nConstantine is regarded as the capital of eastern Algeria and the commercial centre of its region and has a population of about 450,000 (938,475 with the agglomeration), making it the third largest city in the country after Algiers and Oran. There are several museums and historical sites located around the city. Constantine is often referred to as the \"City of Bridges\" because of the numerous picturesque bridges connecting the various hills, valleys, and ravines that the city is built on and around.\nConstantine was named the Arab Capital of Culture in 2015.\n\nHistory\nAncient history\nIn antiquity, the city was originally called Cirta and served as the capital of the Berber kingdom of Numidia. In 112 BC, the city was the capital of the Numidian king Jugurtha, who defeated his half-brother Adherbal. The city later served as the base for Roman generals Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus and Gaius Marius in their war against Jugurtha. Later, with the removal of King Juba I and the remaining supporters of Pompey in Africa (c. 46), Julius Caesar gave special rights to the citizens of Cirta, now known as Colonia Sittlanorum.\nIn 311 AD, during the civil war between emperor Maxentius and usurper Domitius Alexander (a former governor of Africa), the city was destroyed. Rebuilt in 313 AD, it was subsequently named in Latin as \"Colonia Constantiniana\" or \"Constantina\", after emperor Constantine the Great, who had defeated Maxentius. During Roman rule, the city exported wheat and was the only population center that lay on both of the Roman roads paved in ancient Algeria. Captured by the Vandals in 432, Constantine returned to the Byzantine Exarchate of Africa from 534 to 697. Following the Arab conquest of the city in the 8th century, it became known as Qacentina. The city was a part of the wider region of Ifriqiya.\n\nModern history\nThe city recovered in the 12th century and under Almohad and Hafsid rule it was again a prosperous market, with links to Pisa, Genoa and Venice. After taking it from the Hafsids in 1529 it was intermittently part of Ottoman Empire, ruled by a Turkish bey (governor) subordinate to the dey of Algiers. Salah Bey, who ruled the city in 1770–1792, greatly embellished it and built much of the Muslim architecture still visible today. During the Ottoman reign of Constantine, merchants traded a variety of goods such as; agricultural products, animals, embroidered textiles, leather, precious metals, swords, and pistols.\n\nIn 1826 the last bey, Ahmed Bey ben Mohamed Chérif, became the new head of state. He led a fierce resistance against French forces, which invaded Algeria four years later. By 13 October 1837, the territory was captured by France, and from 1848 on until 1962 it was the centre of the Constantine Département. In 1880, while working in the military hospital in Constantine, Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran discovered that the cause of malaria is a protozoan. He observed the parasites in a blood smear taken from a soldier who had just died of malaria. For this, he received the 1907 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. This was the first time that protozoa were shown to be a cause of disease. His work helped inspire researchers and veterinarians today to try to find a cure for malaria in animals.\nIn 1934, Muslim anti-Jewish riots, the 1934 Constantine Pogrom, caused the death of 23 local Jews and 3 local Muslims, 81 people were injured on both sides of the conflict.\nDuring World War II, during the campaign in North Africa (1942–43), Allied forces used Constantine and the nearby cities of Sétif and Bone as operational bases.\n\nGeography\nConstantine is situated on a plateau at an elevation 640 metres (2,100 ft) above sea level. The city is framed by a deep ravine and has a dramatic appearance. The city is very picturesque with a number of bridges over Rhumel River and a viaduct crossing the ravine. The ravine is crossed by seven bridges, including Sidi M'Cid bridge. Constantine is the railhead of a prosperous and diverse agricultural area. It is also a centre of the grain trade and has flour mills, a tractor factory, and industries producing textiles, wool, linen and leather goods. Algeria and Tunisia serve as its markets.\n\nClimate\nConstantine has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa), with hot, dry summers and mild, moist winters.\n\nMain sights\nThe city is framed by a deep ravine and has a dramatic appearance.

Six of these bridges are in ruins today.\" Today the most important bridges are:\n\nSidi M'Cid Bridge (1912), a suspension bridge with a length of 168m,\nBab El Kantra Bridge (1792) bridge which leads toward north,\nSidi Rached bridge (1912), a long viaduct of 447ms and 27 arches, designed by Paul Séjourné,\nDevil's bridge, a tiny beam bridge,\nFalls bridge (1925), formed by a series of arches on top of a waterfall,\nMellah Slimane Bridge (1925), a suspension bridge,\nSalah Bey Bridge (Trans-Rhummel viaduct, 2014), the first cable-stayed bridge in Constantine, designed by Dissing+Weitling architecture,\nMeddjez Dechiche Bridge\n\nEducation\nConstantine has in general four universities: two of them are downtown Constantine Mentouri Public University, designed by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, and Algerian architect Rashid Hassaine, including Zerzara technical engineering pole, Zouaghi Slimane Geography and Earth Sciences Pole, and in the City of El-Khroub is the Institute of Veterinary Sciences. Emir Abdelkader University is one of the biggest Islamic universities with many faculties covering religious studies, foreign languages, and literature. Constantine's new town \"nouvelle ville ali mendjeli\" has two big universities: Université Constantine 2 known as \"lella nsoumer\" offers maths, computer and economy majors, and the new university is actually a university pole with more than 20,000 students, 17 faculties and more than 40,000 residents. It is now the largest African university under the name of \"Université Salah Boubnider\" known as \"Université Constantine 3\".\n\nTransport\nConstantine is served by Mohamed Boudiaf International Airport.\nConstantine also owns its 14.7 km-long tram network serving the city centre at the airport and the main neighbourhoods of the metropolis Constantine tramway.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nConstantine is twinned with:\n\nGrenoble, France\nSousse, Tunisia\n\nNotable people\nConstantine has been the hometown of many noteworthy people in Algeria and France.\n\nAbdelhamid Brahimi, former Prime Minister of Algeria (1984-1988)\nAbdelhamid Ben Badis, Islamic reformer and philosopher\nAbdelmalek Sellal, former Prime Minister of Algeria two terms (2012-2014),(2014-2017)\nAhmed Bey, last Bey of Constantine (1826-1848)\nAhlam Mosteghanemi, writer\nAlfred Nakache, Olympic champion swimmer and Holocaust survivor.\nAli Saïdi-Sief, Olympic medallist\nAmar Bentoumi, lawyer, Algerian independence activist, Algerian politician\nMalek Bennabi, philosopher\nRabah Bitat, third President of Algeria (1978)\nSabri Boukadoum, former Minister of foreign affairs and acting Prime Minister\nMouloud Hamrouche, former Prime Minister of Algeria (1989-1991)\nDjamel Eddine Laouisset, Algerian Scholar\nMasinissa, the first King of Numidia\nHassiba Boulmerka, athlete, first Algerian woman to win an Olympic title (1992)\nPrincess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois, daughter of Louis II, Prince of Monaco, and mother of Prince Rainier III\nRoger Chauviré (1880–1957), French writer\nClaude Cohen-Tannoudji, Nobel Prize winner in physics\nSidi Fredj Halimi, Chief Rabbi and rabbinical court president\nEnrico Macias, French singer\nCheb i Sabbah, DJ, musician and composer\nJean-Michel Atlan, artist\nAlphonse Halimi, world champion boxer\nKateb Yacine, writer\nMaurice Boitel, artist\nSandra Laoura, Olympic medallist\nMalek Haddad, poet\nMoussa Maaskri, actor\nFadéla M'rabet writer and feminist\nCherif Guellal, Algerian diplomat, first ambassador to the USA (1963-1967)\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nLaura Maravall Buckwalter. 2019. \"Factor endowments on the 'frontier': Algerian settler agriculture at the beginning of the 1900s.\" Economic History Review\n\nExternal links\n\nWorldStatesmen- Algeria\n\"Constantine (Cirta)\"—Catholic Encyclopedia\nThe Cascades, Constantine, Algeria\nImages of Constantine in Manar al-Athar digital heritage photo archive",
          "summary": "Constantine (Arabic: قسنطينة, romanized: Qusanṭīnah), also spelled Qacentina or Kasantina, is the capital of Constantine Province in northeastern Algeria. During Roman times it was called Cirta and was renamed \"Constantina\" in honour of Emperor Constantine the Great. Located somewhat inland, Constantine is about 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the Mediterranean coast, on the banks of the Rhumel River.\nConstantine is regarded as the capital of eastern Algeria and the commercial centre of its region and has a population of about 450,000 (938,475 with the agglomeration), making it the third largest city in the country after Algiers and Oran. There are several museums and historical sites located around the city. Constantine is often referred to as the \"City of Bridges\" because of the numerous picturesque bridges connecting the various hills, valleys, and ravines that the city is built on and around.\nConstantine was named the Arab Capital of Culture in 2015.",

The palace was one of the main sights during the selection of Constantine as Arab Capital of Culture in 2015.\n\nHistory\nThe palace was commissioned during the rule of Ahmed Bey ben Mohamed Chérif. Groundbreaking was in 1825, and completion was in 1835, two years before the fall of Constantine into the French occupation. Ahmad Bay summoned a Genovese engineer Chiavino, and two well known artists Al-Jabari and Al-Khatabi for the architectural design.\nWhen the inauguration commenced in 1835–36, Ahmed Bey inhabited the palace as he became the ruler. Ahmed's enjoyment of this wonderful place was short-lived. Two years after he moved in, the French chased him out and turned the palace into their headquarters and with independence the Algerian military moved in and set up camp.\n\nBuilding description\nThe palace consists of three suites and a garden where orange trees and palm trees are planted. The suites are connected to the hallway, which has arcs supported by 266 columns made of marbles. There are also three courtyards and two fountains made of marble. The ceilings are tiled with marble as well. There are 540 doors made of cedar woods, inscribed and engraved with different sculptures and decorations. More than 2,000 square meters of palace walls were decorated with paintings depicting Ahmed Bey's travels to Alexandria, Tripoli and Algeria, as well as 15 months of travel to Istanbul, Cairo and Hejaz in 1818 and 1819 in addition to other travels before and after his reign as Bey of Constantine.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nPalace of the Dey in Algiers\nBey's Palace in Oran\n\n\n== References ==",

          "content": "The Hoggar Mountains (Arabic: جبال هقار, romanized: Jibāl Haqqār; Berber: idurar n Ahaggar) are a highland region in the central Sahara in southern Algeria, along the Tropic of Cancer. The mountains cover an area of approximately 550,000 km2.\nThe Hoggar Mountains are home to the Ahaggar Cultural Park (from 1987 to 2011 Ahaggar National Park). The tallest peak in the range and Algeria, Mount Tahat, is located in the park area, which covers approximately 450,000 square kilometres (170,000 sq mi).\n\nGeography\nThis mountainous region is located about 1,500 km (930 mi) south of the capital, Algiers. The area is largely rocky desert with an average elevation of more than 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level. The highest peak, Mount Tahat, is at 2,908 m (9,541 ft). The mountains are primarily composed of metamorphic rock approximately 2 billion years old, although there are areas where more recent volcanic activity has laid down much newer rock. Several of the more dramatic peaks, such as Ilamen, are the result of erosion wearing away extinct volcano domes, leaving behind the more resistant material that plugged the volcanic cones.\n\nAssekrem is a famous and often visited point where Charles de Foucauld built a hermitage in 1911. \nThe highlands are believed to be one of the main sources of the Tamanrasset River, an ancient river that flowed during the African humid period, and named after the main city near the Hoggar Mountains, Tamanrasset, built in a desert valley or wadi that was part of the ancient watercourse.\n\nEnvironment\nThe Hoggar Mountains range typically experiences hot summers, with a cold winter climate. Temperatures fall below freezing over winter nights. Rainfall is rare and sporadic year-round. However, since the climate is less extreme than in most other areas of the Sahara, the mountains are a major location for biodiversity, including a number of relict species. The Hoggar Mountains are part of the West Saharan montane xeric woodlands ecoregion.\n\nFlora and fauna\nVegetation in this area includes trees such as Vachellia tortilis, Vachellia seyal, myrtle and Tamarix aphylla which are scattered throughout the area. Other plants may include Citrullus colocynthis and Calotropis procera.\nSlightly to the west of the Hoggar range, a population of the endangered African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) remained viable into the 20th century, but is now thought to be extirpated within this entire region. Relict populations of the West African crocodile persisted in the Hoggar Mountains until the early 20th century.\nAnalysis of collected scat in 2006 showed the presence of the Northwest African cheetah in the region. Between August 2008 and November 2010, four individuals were recorded by camera traps. A single cheetah was filmed and photographed by Algerian naturalists in 2020 in the national park in the Atakor volcanic field. The park also contains a population of herbivores such as the saharan subspecies of the barbary sheep and the Dorcas gazelle.\nThe park has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of spotted, crowned and Lichtenstein's Sandgrouse, Pharaoh eagle-owls, pallid harriers, greater hoopoe-larks, bar-tailed and desert larks, pale rock martins, fulvous babblers, white-crowned and mourning wheatears, desert sparrows and trumpeter finches.\n\nHistory\nPrehistoric settlement is evident from extant rock paintings dating to 6000 BC. The Hoggar Massif is the land of the Kel Ahaggar Tuareg. The tomb of Tin Hinan, the woman believed to be the matriarch of the Tuareg, is located at Abalessa, an oasis near Tamanrasset.\nThe hermitage of Charles de Foucauld, which continues to be inhabited by a few Catholic monks, is at the top of the Assekrem plateau in the Hoggar Mountains.\nUnderground atomic tests were conducted by France in the mountains in the 1960s.\n\nSee also\nSaharan rock art\nTeffedest Mountains\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nKeenan, Jeremy (1977).

Elle fait partie de la commune de Bounoura, dans la wilaya de Ghardaïa en Algérie. Avec le reste de la vallée du Mzab, elle est classée au patrimoine mondial de l'Humanité de l'UNESCO.\n\nToponymie\nLe nom de Beni Isguen signifie « les fils de ceux qui détiennent la foi ».\n\nGéographie\nBeni Isguen est une des cités de la pentapole du Mzab. Elle est la seule de la pentapole à être construite sur le flanc d'une colline rocheuse et de ne pas avoir été bâtie sur l'oued M'zab, elle se situe entre le ksar de Melika et celui de Bounoura.\nElle est située à 600 km au sud d'Alger et possède une palmeraie à l'amont. Elle est rattachée administrativement à la commune de Bounoura.\n\nHistoire\nÀ l'instar des autres villes de la Pentapole, Beni Isguen est fondée au XIe siècle, en 1051, par des réfugiés ibadites de Tahert, après la destruction du royaume rostémide par les Fatimides au xe siècle.\nAu XVIe siècle, la cité s'était agrandie par la migration de population de Ghardaïa.\nBeni Isguen est considérée comme une ville sainte, toutefois, cette réputation est assez récente, puisqu'au XIXe siècle, c'est Melika qui était considérée comme la ville sainte du Mzab tandis que Beni Isguen passait pour être la cité militaire de la Pentapole.\nElle avait toutefois le statut de la cité « savante » du Mzab et la gardienne du « dogme », de par le monopole qu'elle exerce sur le savoir et la sauvegarde du rite ibadite, les réformistes mozabites n'ont jamais pu y imposer une grande influence.\nAu XIXe siècle, la ville comportait deux murailles d'enceinte. Toutes les portes de ces deux enceintes étaient fermées la nuit, mais l'espace entre les murailles permettait aux nomades de faire du commerce avec les citadins. Après l'annexion du Mzab par la France en 1882, la cité s'est agrandie et a supprimé la muraille extérieure.\n\nPopulation\nAu début des années 2000, le cité compte entre sept mille et huit mille habitants à l'intérieur des remparts, et à peu près autant dans la ville moderne.\nLes habitants sont divisés en plusieurs fractions qui possèdent chacune un comité social, et parlent le berbère mozabite.\n\nPatrimoine\nLa cité de Beni Isguen et le reste de la vallée du Mzab, sont classés au patrimoine mondial de l'Humanité par l'Unesco depuis 1982. Parmi les secteurs sauvegardés, le ksar de Beni Isguen a conservé depuis sa fondation son modèle organisationnel, notamment son enceinte bordée du côté intérieur par une ruelle et parsemée de tours de guet.\nBeni Isguen présente un plan pyramidal, comme tous les ksours de la pentapole, son tracé concentrique s'organise autour de la mosquée et son minaret. Le point culminant de la ville est la tour Boulila. Elle possède deux portes principales situées au Nord et au Sud : Bab Chergui et Bab Gherbi et trois autres portillons mènent aux différents cimetières. L'entrée dans la ville se fait par une lourde porte, en troncs de palmiers. La cité possède également une autre mosquée.\n\nVie locale\nLa vie locale est réglementée par des lois coutumières, comme dans chaque cité de la pentapole. Devenue ville sainte du Mzab, Beni Isguen se caractérise par un puritanisme très particulier qui interdit aux hommes de fumer dans les rues. C'est une cité riche de bibliothèques aménagées dans des maisons qui possèdent de nombreux manuscrits et ouvrages.\nSur la place du marché, appelée Lalla Achou, située à la périphérie, un marché à la criée se déroule tous les jours excepté le vendredi, qui est une sorte de brocante, très animé. Les transactions commerciales se déroulent sous le contrôle des membres de l'assemblée des « Azzaba », et les femmes mozabites n'ont pas le droit de traverser la place.\nLes maisons de la cité possèdent deux portes : l'une pour les membres de la famille et l'autre pour les invités ; les fenêtres extérieures sont petites pour permettre de voir sans être vu.\nDans les années 2010, un écoquartier a été créé ; baptisé Tafilalet, c'est un ensemble de plus de 1 000 maisons construites selon l'architecture traditionnelle mozabite. Il est niché au sommet d'un plateau qui domine la vallée du Mzab. Son parc abrite une grande variété de palmiers dattiers, d'arbres fruitiers, d'arbustes et de plantes médicinales.\n\nPersonnalités liées à la commune\nMoufdi Zakaria, auteur de l'Hymne national algérien, y est né en 1908.\nIbrahim Boughali, Président de l'Assemblée populaire nationale depuis le 8 juillet 2021, y est né en 1963.\nMuhammad ibn Yūsuf Atfaiyash (1820-1914), érudit et réformateur ibadite.\n\nRéférences\nAnnexes\nArticles connexes\nWilaya de Ghardaïa\nGhardaïa\nMelika\nKsar Tafilelt\n\nLien externe\nAli Lafer \"Beni Isguen\" dans Discover Islamic Art.

The oasis town is watered by an underground river, hence its name is El Oued which enables date palm cultivation and the rare use (for the desert) of brick construction for housing. As most roofs are domed, it is known as the \"City of a Thousand Domes\".\nEl Oued is located 400 miles (640 km) south east of Algiers (the capital city of Algeria), near the Tunisian border. The population of El Oued was 134,699 as of the 2008 census, up from 105,256 in 1998, with a population growth rate of 2.5%.\n\nHistory\nIn the 11th century, the Fatimids sent Banu Hilal to the Tripolitania, Tunisia and Constantine areas to fight against the Zirids.\n\nCulture\nThe inhabitants belong to Teroud tribe (Arabic: بنو طرود) living in and near Oued Souf area.\n\nClimate\nEl Oued has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), with very hot summers and mild winters. Rainfall is light and sporadic, and summers are particularly dry.\n\nTransportation\nThe N16 highway connects El Oued to Touggourt to the southwest and Tebessa to the northeast. The N48 connects El Oued to the town of Still to the north, from which the N3 may be used to reach Biskra.\nEl Oued lies about 20 kilometres (12 mi) south of Guemar Airport.\n\nEducation\n7.4% of the population has a tertiary education, and another 17.5% has completed secondary education.

          "content": "El Oued (en arabe : الوادي) ou Oued Souf, est une commune de la wilaya d'El Oued, dont elle est le chef-lieu. Elle est située dans le nord-est du Sahara algérien  et à 212 km au nord-est de Ouargla et à 512 km au sud-est d'Alger. \nLa ville d'El Oued, capitale du Souf, est surnommée « la ville aux mille coupoles », les Algériens l'appellent « Oued Souf ». L'agglomération compte 187 000 habitants, dont 134 699 pour la seule commune d'El Oued en 2008.\n\nToponymie\nLe toponyme d'origine du lieu « Souf » provient du terme « Suf », qui signifie fleuve, rivière ou oued en berbère.\n« Oued Souf » est un pléonasme. Le nom « oued » signifie en arabe cours d'eau, en référence à un cours d'eau disparu de nos jours. Les chroniqueurs arabes, racontent que lors de l'arrivée des Turuds (tribu bédouine) dans le Souf au XIVe siècle, ils découvrirent l'oued-Souf encore visible.\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nLe territoire de la commune d'El Oued est situé au centre de la wilaya, au sud du Chott Melrhir, à 101 km au nord-est de Touggourt, à 222 km de Biskra, à 212 km au nord-est de Ouargla, à 700 km au sud-est d'Alger et à proximité de la frontière algéro-tunisienne.\nElle est la capitale du Souf.\n\nRelief\nLa ville d'El Oued est pratiquement au niveau de la mer (75 m). Le site de la ville est caractérisé topographiquement par une faible pente, sur lequel on retrouve deux paysages : des grandes dunes de sable et des palmeraies.\n\nTransport\nEl Oued dispose d'un aéroport international situé à 16 km au nord-ouest de la ville, sur le territoire de la commune de Guemar. Des vols effectués par la compagnie Air Algérie relient El Oued à la capitale algérienne, Alger. Il y a également un vol hebdomadaire reliant El Oued à Paris (Aéroport de Roissy-Charles de Gaulle).\nElle est située sur la route nationale 48, et reliée par quatre routes à Biskra, Touggourt, Tébessa, et la Tunisie.\nLa route nationale 16, une des plus longues d'Algérie, qui relie Annaba à Touggourt traverse El Oued.\n\nLocalités de la commune\nLors du découpage administratif de 1984, la commune d'El Oued est composée à partir de six localités :\n\nClimat\nLe climat à El Oued, est désertique et très sec. La classification de Köppen est de type BWh. La température moyenne est de 21.8 °C et la moyenne des précipitations annuelles ne dépasse pas 100 mm.\n\nHistoire\nEl Oued n'est pas une ville très ancienne à l'instar de Touggourt, de Ouargla ou de Ghardaïa. Elle remonte probablement au XVIe siècle, mais n'était encore qu'un gros village, et fut longtemps moins urbanisée que sa rivale Guemar. C'est à partir du XIXe siècle qu'elle s'est imposée comme capitale du Souf.\nLe Souf a été habité depuis des siècles, des vestiges de fossiles et des débris de squelettes ont été attestés. Sa population est issue d'un brassage entre tribus arabes et berbères. \nLa région a attiré de nombreux nomades arabes aujourd'hui sédentarisés, comme les Rebaïa, venus pour beaucoup de Libye, puis les Troud, arrivés à partir du XIVe siècle et les Châamba, venus plus tard au XVIIIe siècle. Ces nomades ont intégré des populations berbères zénètes préexistantes.\nE.Carette écrit au XIXe siècle : « L’oasis de l’Oued Souf, offre encore l'exemple d'un déplacement récent des tribus arabes [...] À une époque encore plus rapprochée de la nôtre, mais que la tradition locale ne précise pas, des voyageurs venant de Troud, en Syrie, s’arrêtèrent un jour dans le réseau des montagnes de sable blanc, appelée autrefois la Tente blanche. Ayant reconnu en ce lieu la présence d’une nappe d’eau à une petite profondeur sous le sol, ils résolurent d’y fixer leur séjour. [...]. Ils ne tardèrent pas à être rejoints par un grand nombre de leurs compatriotes. Plusieurs villes et villages s’élevèrent successivement au milieu des sables ».\n\nDémographie\nSelon le recensement général de la population et de l'habitat de 2008, la population de la commune d'El Oued est évaluée à 134 699 habitants, contre 105 256 habitants en 1998.\nSon agglomération urbaine qui s'étend sur les communes de Robbah, Bayadha et Kouinine, compte 187 000 habitants. Elle est l'une des plus importantes agglomérations urbaines du Sahara algérien, et la douzième au niveau national. La population de la commune a connu une croissance démographique rapide depuis l'indépendance, avec toutefois un ralentissement à partir des années 1990.\n\nAdministration\nÀ l'issue du découpage administratif de 1984, la ville d'El Oued est élevée au rang de chef-lieu de wilaya, qui représente un territoire historique (le Souf) replacé dans le réseau institutionnel. La commune est également chef-lieu de daïra.\nL'administration française avait désigné la ville comme capitale de la région, et ainsi en avait fait le pôle unique auquel s'identifiait toute la population soufie. El Oued est érigé en commune en 1958, dans le département des Oasis. Elle était auparavant un chef-lieu de commune mixte.\nDe nombreuses mesures ont accompagné le développement accéléré de la wilaya qui visaient essentiellement le développement des services, des équipements et des infrastructures. À cause du processus de centralisation économique et administrative, la ville d'El Oued a évolué vers l'hypertrophie urbaine.\n\nUrbanisme\nLa ville d'El Oued se distingue par son architecture adaptée et l'utilisation des matériaux locaux (gypse et plâtre) et de techniques appropriées (arcades et coupoles) dans les constructions. La médina, plus simple dans son urbanisme que celles de Touggourt ou Ouargla, est mieux conservée. Les maisons traditionnelles y sont basses, surmontées de coupoles pour mieux réfléchir la lumière et pour maintenir de la fraîcheur à l'intérieur.\nLa ville est traversée par l'avenue Mohamed Khemisti, son artère principale. Elle se caractérise par son étalement horizontal, les élévations considérables de températures empêchent la construction en hauteur. Le parc des logements collectifs est marginal. L'urbanisation s'allonge le long de la route nationale du nord au sud, car l'extension est bloquée à l'est par les cratères des palmeraies et à l'ouest par les hautes dunes. L'agglomération constitue ainsi une conurbation, annexant à partir d'El Oued, les localités de Kouinine, Robbah et Bayadha, sur 20 km de continuité spatiale. \nAprès indépendance, l'arrivée de réfugiés, installés en Tunisie, a été à l'origine d'une première extension de la ville : El Gaouatine, (le quartier des tentes, appelé ainsi en référence aux habitations d'urgence mises en place par les réfugiés). D'autres quartiers se sont développés, accueillant les populations des ksour du Souf, d'anciens nomades et des Nememcha des Aurès. Les parties attenantes au vieux marché font l'objet de transformation qui permet l'extension du marché dans la vieille ville. La ville s'est dotée ensuite d'un quartier résidentiel Er Rimmel. \nL'extension future de la ville est orientée par des contraintes physiques importantes. Il s'agit du caractère inconstructible du sol dunaire, de la zone des chotts et des dépressions. La ville est également handicapée par la remontée de la nappe phréatique, devenue source de pollution. Face à ce problème, des travaux d'assainissement ont été menés, Parallèlement, une opération de reboisement a été également initiée.\n\nÉconomie\nBien qu'El Oued soit connue pour sa phoeniciculture, le secteur tertiaire domine les activés économiques et occupe la majorité des actifs. La remontée des eaux, a détruit un nombre considérable de palmiers, ce qui a réduit les activités agricoles. La région du Souf est un pôle commercial et industriel dynamique, elle connait un développement dans l'agro-alimentaire orienté vers l'exportation.  \nLongtemps marginalisés et les ressources locales étant limitées, les Soufis ont émigré au nord du pays. Ils sont aujourd'hui à l'origine d'un dynamisme commercial entre nord et sud. Les réseaux commerciaux développés ont permis de faire de la région un pole important des échanges marchandises et de développement des petites et moyennes industries . \nMalgré son caractère austère, El Oued est une ville active et commerçante. Le marché, situé en contrebas de la vieille ville est très animé. La ville est la capitale du tissage en laine, l'artisanat est actif : tissage de burnous, haïk, couvertures, tapis de haute laine.\nLe secteur hôtelier est relativement satisfaisant. Il existe plusieurs hôtels de catégories différentes. La ville abrite un grand complexe touristique, dénommé \"La gazelle d'or\", situé à l'entrée Ouest de la ville.\n\nVie quotidienne\nCulture\nLe musée du Souf, témoin de l'histoire de la région, recèle des collections dans les divers domaines: ethnologiques, géographiques, géologiques et zoologiques.\nAu printemps, la ville organise une fête du folklore local : la courses de chameaux.\n\nPatrimoine\nLe vieux quartier d'El Acheche-Massaâba a été classé secteur sauvegardé, et la zaouïa  El Kadiria et la zaouia ainsi que le minaret Sidi Salem ont été inscrits sur l'inventaire supplémentaire des sites et monuments classés au patrimoine culturel algérien.\n\nSanté\nIl y a deux hôpitaux pour un total de 444 lits qui desservent la région.\nEn 2019, le secteur de la santé de la ville a été marqué par le drame de l'incendie de la maternité de la cité du 17-Octobre ayant coûté la vie à huit nourrissons.\n\nEnseignement supérieur\nDepuis 1995, la ville d'El Oued abrite une université baptisée au nom du chahid Hamma Lakhdar, tombé au champ d’honneur à l’âge de 25 ans. \nD'abord centre universitaire, l'établissement sera élevé au rang d'université en juin 2012. Le campus universitaire s'étale sur une superficie de 150 ha et accueille plus de 18 000 étudiants répartis à travers six facultés et encadrés par près de 704 enseignants de différents grades.\n\nSport\nLa ville dispose d'un stade de football: Stade du 1er-Novembre-1954, où sont basés les clubs de football de la ville: l'US Souf et l'Olympique El Oued.\n\nJumelage\nLa ville d'El Oued est jumelée avec :\n\n Tozeur (Tunisie)\n\nPersonnalités liées à la commune\nAbdellah Menai, chanteur et artiste.\nDjillali Mehri, homme d'affaires algérien.\nCharles de Foucauld séjourna dans cette ville qu'il dessina, comme on peut le voir dans sa Vue d'El Oued (10 décembre 1885), conservé à la Bibliothèque nationale de France.\nYasser Larouci, footballeur franco algérien, y est né en 2001.\nAli Bousbia écrivain et historien fondateur de l'association culturelle Lamine Lamoudi et militant pour la mémoire de la guerre de la libération\n\nNotes et références\nAnnexes\nBibliographie\nAu pays des sables, Isabelle Eberhardt, Paris Éditions Joelle Losfeld, 2002\nRichesses de la France, janvier 1962 no 50, sous la Direction de Si Boubakeur, le département des Oasis, Le Souf & El oued, Bordeaux imprimeries Delmas.\nSaïd Belguidoum, « Urbanisation et urbanité au Sahara », Méditerranée, vol. 99, no 3,‎ 2002 (DOI 10.3406/medit.2002.3261, lire en ligne, consulté le 17 janvier 2021)\n\nArticles connexes\nWilaya d'El Oued\nCommunes de la wilaya d'El Oued\nSouf\n\nLiens externes\n\nRessource relative à l'architecture : Liste indicative du patrimoine mondial  \n\nSite de la Direction du tourisme de la wilaya d'El Oued\n\n Portail des communes d'Algérie",

          "content": "Biskra (Arabic: بسكرة) is the capital city of Biskra Province, Algeria. In 2007, its population was recorded as 307,987. Biskra is located in northeastern Algeria, about 248 miles (399 km) from Algiers, 71 miles (114 km) southwest of Batna and 137 miles (220 km) north of Touggourt. It is nicknamed \"The Queen of the Zibans\", \"The Door of the Desert\" or \"The Saharan Nice\" because of its location at the beginning of the Sahara Desert. Due to its geographical location, its climate and natural resources, particularly farming, Biskra has always been a crossroad between the cities in the north and south. It has seen the passage of several civilizations, from the Romans and the Arabs to the French.\nIn 1844, Biskra became a French garrison, which saw fighting during rebellions in 1849 and 1871.\nCurrently the city of Biskra has 28 neighborhoods, including the three principal neighborhoods of Korra, City 60 Logements, and Equipment Zones. It is in the southern part of the Algerian rail system, and has become a popular winter resort.\n\nEtymology\nThe city has been known by many names, including Biskra, Sokkra, Vescra, Vecera, Vescera, Adbesran. Historians do not agree on the origins of the current name. Some say its name comes from \"Vescera\", which means \"station\" or \"place\" of commercial exchange, due to its location connecting north and south. The Roman leader Betolimih Benyouba named it \"the river of destiny\" because of the Sidi Zarzour (its current name) that crosses the city.\nSome researchers say that its name was derived from the ancient Roman name \"Adebesran\" because of the geothermal source that is located near the city, known as Salhine Hammam. Other sources say that the name comes from the word \"Sokkra\" because of the quality of the sweet dates in the city's oases. Still others claim that the current name was given to the city by the Carthaginians.\nIn honor of the city, the name was given to an oasis, Biskra Palms, near Palm Springs, California.\n\nHistory\nGaetuli\nThe Gaetuli first appeared in North Africa during the 3rd millennium BC. They settled in a large territory south of the Roman provinces of Africa and Mauritania. According to the Greek historian Strabo, they were the most numerous people of North Africa yet the least known. Among the oldest references to the Gaetuli are those of the Carthaginians, who indicated that the Prince of the Gaetuli proposed to marry Élyssa (or Dido for the Romans), the founding queen of Carthage (present-day Tunisia) around 815 BC. However, references in ancient Egypt of certain tribes go back to 1350 BC, during the reign of Akhenaten of the eighteenth dynasty, speak of cattle trade with this people.\nThe Gaetuli are probably the origin of the Berber calendar, which begins around 943–949 BC, which would be after the victory of a coalition of Gétules over the Egyptians. This coalition, formed by the North African tribes, left southwestern Algeria, increasing its force as it passed through North Africa. The coalition led by Shoshenq (Berber name: Sheshnaq) defeated Pharaoh Psusennes II. Following this victory, Sheshnaq married the pharaoh's daughter, settled on the throne of Egypt under the name of Sheshonq in 952 BC, and founded the 22nd Dynasty. This biblical event is mentioned in the Old Testament, which speaks of the pillaging of this leader of the Machaouach tribe.\nWhile traversing the desert, the Gaetuli arrived with the Taureg at Tassili, where they stayed for an extended time and subsequently mixed with the Tuareg and learned the Tamazight language for cultural and commercial exchanges. However, the Gaetuli eventually began to feel out of place and decided to continue north.\nIn Algeria, they settled at the edge of the Aures, where they posed problems to Roman infiltration in the 3rd century BC as they were stellar horsemen and became dreaded in combat. It was necessary to involve a late Roman politician, Gaius Marius, to negotiate exploration of the South against concessions of agricultural land around Cirta and Setifis, at the time under Roman rule; a trick of dispersing them and so diminished in their strength. Thus, the Gétule were occupied by the Romans.\n\nRoman colonization\nThe city of Biskra experienced many violent wars during the Roman colonization, including the resistance war led by the Berber leader Tacfarinas, followed by his successor, the militant Jugurtha \"Youghorta\". With the help of the inhabitants of the city, who provided human and material support, Jugurtha destroyed the Roman army at the end of the so-called Numidia region.\n\nThe Vandals in the 4th century\nThe Vandals \"Oundals\" invaded the city of Biskra and occupied all its land, but the resistance and continuous fighting of its inhabitants forced the Vandals to integrate with them. After a few decades, the Romans took over the city, where they built obstacles to protect themselves from the vengeance of the population.\n\nThe arrival of the Arab conqueror Uqba ibn Nafi al-Fihri in the 7th century\nThey remained with such vigilance until the arrival of the Arab conqueror Uqba ibn Nafi al-Fihri in the 7th century AD. During this period, the whole area came under the Arab-Muslim monarchy. After 20 years of conquest, Uqba ibn Nafi died in 683 AD when he returned from Morocco with his army. His death was organized by an ambush mounted by his adversary, the Numidian prince (Berber) Koceila and his army at Tahouda, a small village located 5 km from the oasis \"Sidi Okba\". His body was buried in the mosque of the city that took his name. According to the imam of this mosque, it contains more than 300 tombs and is the 4th holy place of Islam, after Mecca, Medina and Aksa.\nIn the early 10th century, Biskra and the entire Ziban area were conquered by the kings of Beni Hammad.\n\nThe Hillal Bannis in the 12th century\nFollowed by the Kabyla of Elathbend banished Hilal (Hilalian Arabs) who removed and confiscated the property of the inhabitants. They asked for the help of the Almohads of the kingdom of Marrakech in the 12th century.\n\nIn the book Al Istibsar fi 'agaib al-Amsar, written in the late 12th century, the author describes the city as:\"A large city, surrounded by many fortresses and thriving villages, and it serves as their capital. It has a vast forest abundant with palm trees, olive trees, and various fruits. Biskra is particularly known for its numerous palm trees. [..] A large river flows through the forest of Biskra, descending from the Aurès Mountains, irrigating its orchards and palm groves. It stretches for about six miles through a continuous forest connected to the city, running through its villages. Biskra is also a center of jurisprudence and knowledge, home to scholars. Among its villages is a place called Malsoun.\"\n\nThe Hafsids in the 14th century\nIn the 14th century, the Hafsid arrived in Tunisia and Algeria. Biskra became an important hub for the Hafsid of Tunisia where it remained under lure monarchy and direction for a long time then under the authority of the Marinid Sultanate of Fez and banned Abd-Elouadi and the Znatiyin of Tlemcen.\n\nThe conquest of the city by the Turks in 1541\nIn 1541, the Turks began their conquest of the city under the direction of Hocine Agha who defended the city of Algiers at the time and brought out the strength of Charles Compte of the latter.\nThe Ottoman Empire remained in the city for three centuries until the French colonized it.\n\nFrench colonization from 1844\nAfter the French conquest of Biskra in 1844, the site was fortified to secure the area against uprisings. El-hadj Mohammed Esaghire Elokbi, as the successor to El-Emir Abdelkader, waged continued war against the French, attacking the French forces under Lamoriciere on 23 December 1847. Elokbi also opposed the Ben Ghana clan as well as Ahmed Bey's claim as ruler of Constantine. Resistance continued in the Ziban and Aurès Moufrntains.\nIn Biskra the local chief Bou Zian rallied the people against the palm tax, seizing the moated fortification of Zaatcha 20 km from Biskra. The French marched on Zaatcha, laying siege for months. It finally fell after 53 days of attacks by a French force of 7,000 troops. Bou Zian was killed. The French counted the loss of 2130. French control nonetheless remained tenuous when attacks were mounted again in 1879 at El-kamri.\nSome 100 years after the battle of Zaatcha, in 1954 Biskra was again the scene of anti-French assaults during the Algerian War of Independence where house-to-house battles cost many lives.\n\nIn culture\nAt the end of the 19th century Biskra, a popular spa town and gateway to the Sahara, became a center for artists and photographers such as Émile Frechon, Alexandre Bougault and Rudolf Franz Lehnert. From 1872 to 1920 the French Count Albert Landon de Longueville hosted in his villa-cum-chateau at Biskra (today Villa Bénévent), nobility, artists and writers, including Béla Bartok, Oscar Wilde, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, André Gide, Nasreddine Dinet, Eugène Fromentin, Karl Marx, Anatole France, Francis James and Henri Matisse.\nBiskra is the setting of key sections of André Gide's 1902 novel The Immoralist and lesser known 1897 prose-poem Les nourritures terrestres (The Fruits of the Earth), and he visited the town in 1895 (for a fortnight from 31 January) with Lord Alfred Douglas, following a meeting with Oscar Wilde in Blida and Algiers.\nThe French artist Henri Matisse has a work titled Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra) an oil painting finished in 1907.\nThe Hungarian composer Béla Bartók collected traditional music in Biskra in 1913.\nThe Polish composer Karol Szymanowski, who traveled to North Africa, seemed to have been quite impressed by Biskra. This trip probably aroused genuine interest in the North African/ Arabic culture. He composed many pieces influenced by his experience there. He sent a postcard from Biskra on 11 April 1914.\nDiana Mayo, the protagonist of Edith Maude Hull's popular 1919 novel The Sheik, starts her journey into the desert from Biskra, and in the identically named 1921 silent movie The Sheik starring Rudolph Valentino in perhaps his most famous role.\nWinston Churchill's cousin, sculptor and author Clare Sheridan held a salon in Biskra in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nGeography\nBiskra is located in the north-east of Algeria, in the district of Biskra. The city lies about 248 miles (399 km) from Algiers, 71 miles (114 km) southwest of Batna and 137 miles (220 km) north of Touggourt. She is nicknamed \"The Queen of the Zibans\", \"The door of the desert\" or \"The Saharan Nice\" because of its location which is the beginning of the desert.\nIt is located at an altitude of 87 m (285 ft) in the northern part of the Sahara Desert.\nApart from the mountains that surround it, the topography of Biskra is generally very flat. Part of the city is surrounded by the Sfa Pass and the Ziban Mountains. In the outskirts of Biskra, the landscape is very arid with all the same vegetation that vary depending on the location. Small water points can be found in the outskirts of Biskra, especially in the oases and canyons of the mountains around El Kantara. The prefecture of Biskra is crossed by Oued Labiod waterways, Oued El Arab, Djedi, Oued Meziraâ, Oued El and Oued el Gantara. The city covers an area of 127.55 km2 (49.25 sq mi). It has a population of 307,987 and is the 10th most populous city. It has a population density of 1,612.0 inhabitants per square meter. The population of Biskra are called Biskri.\nAs in the rest of the country, Biskra does not observe summer time and stays in the same time zone all year round. Whether winter or summer, the time is always the same in Biskra. The sunrise is around 7:41 am to 21 December and 5:24 am on 21 June. The sunset is around 5:30 pm on 21 December and at 7:54 pm on 21 June.\n\nCityscape\nNeighborhoods\nThe city of Biskra has gone through three phases before getting to where it is today. Started by the pre-colonial phase which testifies, that the city was pending this period under Roman rule over country of the Berbers, and having taken the role of the capital of southern Numidia, and the\nA very prosperous city, built by the Muslims in the Middle Ages. During the Turkish period the city was hit by epidemics, binding occupiers of the fort to leave the city to settle, in a group scattered the interior of the palm grove, south of the city, around two elements of the form local production, the built environment that are the mosque and seguias, besides the use local building materials.\nSecondly, the city was marked by the colonial phase characterized by the building of fort Saint Germain on the northern part, and the construction of a city (the colonial checkerboard) by an urban model, different from the previous one, and having undergone several extension, particularly the 1st and 2nd and the Dervau Plan, followed during the 50s, by popular extensions to the South at the expense of the palm grove and without dimensional and formal logic.\nIn the end the post colonial phase characterized by the proliferation of self-built no plan to urban and architectural quality at least and without model, where typological reference, which has only to be curbed, after the instruction of the laws intervention and control of the state, over the urban space, by launching large Housing development operations in the framework of ZUNH, in the form of housing communal collective or subdivision which, despite this, has not been able to resolve the demand for housing, bringing the state to promulgation, other laws havingobjective, improving urban quality, openness and diversification stakeholders.\nToday, the city of Biskra is made up of 28 neighborhoods including 3 main ones which are, Korra, City 60 Logts ENICAB and Equipment Zones.\n\nClimate\nBiskra has a subtropical hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) typical of the region in which it is found. The city has long and extremely hot summers and short, pleasantly warm winters. In summer, the peaks of heat are among the highest in the country with temperatures that can exceed 49 °C (120 °F) and are similar to cities like Luxor or Phoenix. The average peak July temperature, which is the hottest month, is about 42 °C (108 °F). On average, the city experiences more than 92 days a year where the temperature is equal to or exceeds 38 °C (100 °F) and nearly 20 days above 43 °C (109 °F). In comparison, New York City has had a total of 59 days when the temperature was equivalent to or above 38 °C (100 °F) since 1870. Temperatures generally begin to approach or even exceed 34 °C (93 °F) by April. Biskra is one of the hottest cities in the country when it comes to daytime temperatures. Indeed, this one is often higher than 27 °C (81 °F) during the hottest months. The highest minimum temperature recorded in Biskra was 37 °C (99 °F) on 4 July 1993, making it the hottest night ever recorded in the city. On 14 July 1910, the temperature reached 51 °C (124 °F) which is the record of heat in Biskra.\n\nThe climate is very dry and mostly very clear. Rainfall is limited to only 128.8 mm per year.

          "content": "Biskra (anciennement Vescera à l'époque romaine puis Biscra, en arabe : بسكرة, en tamazight : ⴱⵉⵙⴽⵔⴰ) est une commune du Nord-est du Sahara algérien, chef-lieu de la wilaya de Biskra, située à 400 km environ au sud-est d'Alger.\nCapitale des Zibans et premier pôle urbain saharien, la ville comptait 205 608 habitants en 2008 et se place au 10e rang au niveau national. Elle est située sur un point stratégique, car elle est la porte du désert du Sahara.\nLa ville est entourée par les monts du Zab. L'activité agricole est très présente, notamment pour la culture des dattes. Localisée au début du désert du Sahara, Biskra possède un climat désertique chaud.\n\nToponymie\nLe toponyme « Biskra » vient du nom de la ville romaine de Vescera, qui serait selon une première hypothèse, d'origine phénicienne, bien qu'aucune présence carthaginoise sur les lieux ne vient confirmer, et selon une deuxième hypothèse, d'origine latine, ayant le sens de « station ». Vescera/ Bescera serait également le nom d'une tribu sédentarisée du Zab et transformée en communauté civique à l’époque romaine\nPlus probablement, Vescera, prononcé [weskera], dériverait du verbe berbère wesker ou esker, signifiant en touareg « être bien établi sur sa base », « être bien fait » ou en kabyle « être moyen », « être plutôt bon », « faire », ou dériverait du mot en tamazight du Maroc central taskart (pluriel taskarin) signifiant « petite plaine » ou « petit terrain plat ».\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nSituée au nord du Sahara algérien, au pied du massif de l'Aurès et des monts du Zab, Biskra est surnommée la « reine des Zibans », « porte du désert ». Elle est la porte orientale du Sahara algérien.\nLa ville se situe à 123 km au sud-ouest de Batna, à 388 km au nord de Ouargla, à 242 de Constantine, à 331 de Skikda, à 332 de Tébessa et à 425 au sud-est d'Alger.\nCapitale des Ziban, elle occupe une position centrale dans cette région, entre le Zab Rharbi (secteur de Tolga) à l'ouest, une région agricole prospère et le Zab Chergui (secteur de Sidi Okba).\n\nRelief et hydrographie\nElle est située une altitude de 120 m, ce qui fait d'elle une des villes les plus basses d'Algérie ; elle est au pied du col de Sfa (258 m) dans les monts du Zab, à seulement 7 km au nord de la ville, au débouché d’une large dépression qui s’ouvre entre le massif de l’Aurès et l’Atlas saharien occidental.\nLa ville de Biskra est traversée par l'oued Biskra qui prend sa source dans les Aurès et se jette dans le chott Melrhir, après un parcours d'environ 194km. L'oued est habituellement à sec à Biskra, l'apport propre à chaque crue peut rester relativement faible.\n\nLocalités de la commune\nLors du découpage administratif de 1984, la commune de Biskra est composée à partir des localités et lieux-dits suivants :\n\nTransports\nLa ville de Biskra est desservie :\n\npar l'aéroport international de Biskra - Mohamed Khider, relié par des vols réguliers à l'étranger ;\npar une ligne ferroviaire la reliant à Skikda et à Touggourt ;\nun tramway est en phase d'étude ;\npar la gare routière SNTV qui se trouve à 11 km du centre-ville ce qui fait 17 minutes en voiture.\n\nClimat\nBiskra a un climat désertique chaud (classification de Köppen BWh) typique de la région dans laquelle elle se trouve. La ville possède des étés longs et extrêmement chauds et des hivers doux. La température annuelle moyenne est de 21,8 °C.\nLe climat y est très aride et la plupart du temps très clair. Les précipitations sont limitées à seulement 128,8 mm par an. Les précipitations sont assez rares malgré quelques averses enregistrées généralement durant les mois les plus froids, principalement novembre. Les chaleurs extrêmes qui règnent durant l'été peuvent causer de violents orages à la fin de celui-ci, qui se produisent généralement en septembre, lorsque le taux d'humidité de l'air devient nettement plus élevé, le taux moyen annuel est 41 % d'humidité. Le mois avec le taux le plus haut à Biskra est décembre avec 59 % d'humidité, juillet est le mois le moins lourd avec seulement 27 % en moyenne par an.\nHormis les précipitations ou l'humidité, les vents sont fréquents durant deux périodes de l'année : vents relativement humides  pendant l'hiver, et vents de sable pendant le printemps.\n\nVégétation\nLe couvert végétal est très limité. Les espèces recensées sont généralement cultivées : eucalyptus, acacia, frêne, caroubier, palmier, olivier de Bohème, laurier-rose, tamarix, qui se trouvent au niveau des jardins publics. Des arbres d'alignement (Ficus retusa et acacia) se trouvent également au niveau de quelques artères.\n\nHistoire\nPériode antique\nLes traces de présence humaine dans la région de Biskra, remontent approximativement à 1 000 ans avant J.-C. Biskra et la région des Ziban, alors nommée la « Gétule », faisaient partie de l'empire numide proclamé par Massinissa.\nLes Romains ont établi dans la région une ville fortifiée, appelée Vescera, chargée de surveiller les Aurès. La ville est née de la sédentarisation de la tribu de Vescera/ Bescera. Elle est aussi appelée Ad Piscinam, en référence à une source (Hammam Essalihine).\nL'oasis de Biskra constitua une étape sur les parcours commerciaux nord-sud depuis l'Antiquité et, sous l'Empire romain, un des points des limes délimitant l'Empire au sud. Vescera s'est développée et devient durant la période chrétienne, le siège d'un évêché, celui de Bescera. Le nom des Besceri est identifiable avec la tribu gélule des Misiciri. Au Ve siècle, les Vandales, qui s'en emparent, exilent son évêque, Optat de Vescera.\n\nPériode musulmane\nPendant l'ère musulmane, la ville est le siège de Koceïla qui est le commandant des Awerbas et avaient également le pouvoir avec les Chaouis et les Zénètes. Et après ce litige, la ville sera sous le contrôle des Omeyyades[réf. à confirmer].\nLe conquérant arabe Oqba ibn Nafi est mort dans les environs de la ville. Une mosquée sera érigée à l'endroit de son décès et elle portera son nom (la mosquée de Sidi Okba). Le rayonnement commercial et culturel de Biskra continuait de s'affirmer avec la conquête musulmane. Au début de la période islamique, la région du Zab connaît la diffusion du courant ibadite.\nDès le IXe siècle, Biskra devient un centre important grâce au commerce saharien. Elle supplante Tobna et devient le centre actif d'une province et la concurrente directe de Sedrata. La ville est gérée par un conseil administratif au sein duquel siègent les représentants des principales familles. Après les Fatimides, Biskra et sa région passèrent ensuite sous le contrôle des Hammadides. Sous les Hammadides, elle est autonome avec un conseil de cheikh où deux familles se disputent la prééminence: les Banou Rummān et les Banou Sindi.\nL'arrivée des Arabes hilaliens au XIe siècle, provoque la formation d'une nouvelle carte socio-religieuse dans la région et contribue à arabiser les autochtones. Ils occupent les lieux puis les Almohades vont les en chasser au début du XIIe siècle et y imposer leur domination. C'est à cette époque qu'elle supplante Tobna et définitivement Tabouda.\n\nAu XIe siècle, Al-Bakri qui décrit son bel aspect et sa prospérité, ses remparts et la richesse de son oasis, écrit que les habitants de Biskra sont des convertis au malikisme et que sa région était peuplée de Berbères Sadrâta et Maghraouas, et le mentionne comme une étape nécessaire de la route d'Oran à Kairouan. Au XIIe siècle, Al Idrissi situe Biskra sur eux grands axes, le premier Est-ouest et le second nord-sud, de Bougie à Tobna.\nBiskra était reliée aux réseaux juridiques et son apparition dans le corpus juridique malikite de la fin du Moyen Âge marque la disparition totale de l'ibâḍisme du Zâb. C'est à la fin du XIIIe siècle que Biskra est dotée d'une citadelle. Au XIVe siècle, elle atteint son apogée politique mais aussi économique. On y reçoit les ambassadeurs du Mali pour traiter des affaires, et ce, malgré la concurrence de Ouargla et Touggourt.\nBiskra s'impose au XIVe siècle comme la véritable capitale du Zab, sous la famille des Béni Mozni, qui s'appuyaient tour à tour sur les différentes dynasties du Maghreb et les tribus nomades du Sahara pour imposer leur hégémonie. En effet, elle devient la capitale d’une principauté pratiquement indépendante et prospère. Les Béni Mozni s'allient aux souverains de Béjaïa, de Tlemcen ou de Fès.\nÀ la fin du XVe siècle, Biskra et le Zab deviennent le fief des nomades arabes Dawāwida. La ville fut occupée par les Turcs au XVIe siècle, à la suite des deux expéditions de Hassan Agha en 1542 et de Salah Raïs en 1552, viennent y établir une garnison et y construire un fort.\n\nLe beylik de l'Est s'appuie sur Biskra pour s'assurer le contrôle de la région. Hassan Agha donne à Ali Bou Akkaz, le titre de Cheikh El Arab avec le commandement des tribus du Zab. Pendant toute l'époque ottomane, la ville et les Ziban étaient dominés par deux grandes familles, les Benganah et les Bouakkaz, qui s'y disputaient le pouvoir. En 1680, une épidémie de peste provoque le décès de 7 000 personnes. Des Biskris vivaient dans l'agglomération algéroise, notamment dans les gourbis de Bab-Azzoun, et occupaient des métiers tels que ceux de portefaix, d'agent de police ou de vidangeur.\n\nLa période coloniale\nBiskra est occupée par le duc d'Aumale le 4 mars 1844. À l'arrivée des Français, Ahmed Bel Hadj, le représentant d'Abdelkader  dans l'oasis, s'était replié avec ses hommes. Les habitants se révoltent ; dès 1844, la garnison française est massacrée. L'émir Abd El-Kader dirige tout le Zab. Le mouvement va s'étendre à la région des Zaatchas. Les Zaatchas se révoltent sous la direction du cheikh Bouziane. Une « ville française » se développe à côté de la « ville arabe ».\nLes Ben Gana sont restés la famille la plus influente et ont occupé la plupart des postes de commandement de la région. Quelques Juifs vivaient dans la ville vers 1960. La plupart de ses membres étaient originaires de la ville ou de ses environs : Ouled Djellal, Tolga, Sidi Okba ou El Oued. Certains vivaient de la même manière que les musulmans, et certains étaient aussi agriculteurs, producteurs de dattes, notamment dans l'oasis de Gharta. La nouvelle synagogue construite dans les années 1950 fut changée en chambre de commerce lors de l'indépendance.\nDans le cadre de l'organisation du Front de libération nationale, Biskra fait d'abord partie de la Zone 1 (Aurès) sous la direction de Mostefa Ben Boulaïd ; à partir du congrès de la Soummam (août 1956), elle relève de la Wilaya VI (Sahara). Dans la nuit du 31 octobre au 1er novembre 1954, le poste de police de Biskra  est attaqué, ce qui marque le début de la guerre d'Algérie. La région joua un rôle important sous la conduite du colonel Si El Haouès.\n\nAdministration\nBiskra jouit d'un triple statut administratif. Elle est chef-lieu de wilaya et capitale micro-régionale des Zibans. Après l'indépendance, elle était chef-lieu de daïra des Aurès, jusqu'en 1974. Elle constitue l'élément majeur de l'organisation de l'espace wilayal. Par la concentration de l'administration centrale, des établissements financiers, des sièges de sociétés nationales, des directions générales, des entreprises publiques et privées, et des commerces, elle constitue le relais économique et administratif de l'influence nationale sur l'ensemble du territoire wilayal.\nDurant la période coloniale, la « ville arabe » devient une « commune indigène », administrée par les officiers des Affaires indigènes ; elle inclut alors les postes de T'Kout et d'Ouled Djellal. La « ville française » et les alentours de Biskra (80 km2) sont érigés en commune mixte par arrêté du 6 novembre 1868 puis en commune de plein exercice par décret du 22 mai 1878. Elle est rattachée à l'arrondissement de Batna (département de Constantine). T'kout est alors rattaché à la commune mixte de l'Aurès (chef-lieu : Arris). Par décret du 12 décembre 1905, le reste de la « commune indigène » est rattaché territoire de Touggourt. Une base aérienne (BA 212, actuel aéroport Mohamed Khider) s'y installe vers 1920. Par arrêté du 26 avril 1933, la « commune indigène » devient une commune mixte.\nEn 1956, Batna devient une préfecture et Biskra une sous-préfecture du département de Batna (ou : « de l'Aurès ») ; la commune mixte intègre l'arrondissement de Biskra et les anciens douars deviennent des communes.\n\nDémographie\nSelon le recensement général de la population et de l'habitat de 2008, la population de la commune de Biskra est évaluée à 205 608 habitants, dont 204 661 habitants dans l'agglomération urbaine. Elle est la première agglomération urbaine du Sahara algérien et la dixième du pays.\nL'attractivité de l'agglomération de Biskra s'inscrit spatialement sur l'Est algérien d'Illizi à Skikda. La commune ne dispose pas d'agglomération secondaire. Elle se compose d'une grosse agglomération chef-lieu et d'une zone éparse.\nEn 1987, la ville comptait 128 000 habitants, elle avait subi les retombées de l’exode rural qui a fait augmenter la population de l'ordre de 62% par rapport à celle, estimée en 1977; ces populations, nés hors de la ville, sont originaires des Zibans essentiellement.\nLa ville de Biskra était la seule ville, dans les années 1950, de tout le Sahara qui comptait plus de 50 000 habitants.\n\nUrbanisme\nRéputée pour sa palmeraie, Biskra semble avoir depuis longtemps rompu avec son statut oasien. En effet, elle s'est développée à l'époque coloniale au tracé en damier. Les faubourgs algériens, populaires et denses, se sont constitués sur sa frange sud, coincés entre noyau colonial et palmeraie. L'urbanisme est désormais, similaire à celui du Nord du pays, peu adapté à une région aride.\nLa véritable urbanisation de la ville commence avec la conquête musulmane. Le premier noyau urbain à l'intérieur de la palmeraie au sud de la ville actuelle remonte à la période ottomane, les Turcs édifièrent un fort avec trois portes : Bab El Dharb, Bab El Feth et Bab El Mekbra. Durant la seconde moitié du XVIIe siècle, une épidémie de peste ravage la ville et conduit à l'abandon du site initial et la création de nouveaux ksour à l'intérieur de la palmeraie. Ces sept pôles de peuplement représentent les sept vieux quartiers de l'agglomération de Biskra. Ils sont répartis sur un tracé régulier linéaire : Guedacha, Medjniche, Ras El Gueria, Mcid, Bab El Dharb, Bab El Feth et Sidi Barkat.\n\nL'avènement de la colonisation française de l'Algérie en 1830, apporte une rupture à la fois sociale et spatiale dans le tissu urbain de la ville . Une ville coloniale voit le jour, située au nord de la palmeraie formalisant ainsi la ségrégation des populations algériennes ( indigènes) et Européens. Au sud de cette nouvelle ville, émergèrent des quartiers d'habitat destinés aux autochtones attirés par les activités économiques de la ville. Le plan de Constantine, en plein Guerre d'Algérie apporte son lot de programmes de logements sociaux au profit des populations algériennes avec l’édification de grands ensembles .\nAprès l'indépendance de l'Algérie, la croissance urbaine de Biskra s'est faite en tache d'huile. L'urbanisation accélérée a permis l'articulation entre la vieille ville et la ville coloniale. Mais ces espaces étaient limités. Dans un premier temps, l'urbanisation s'est poursuivie vers l'ouest et a franchi la voie ferrée. Puis, la topographie limitant vite les possibilités dans cette direction; une extension de l'urbanisation de la ville s'est orientée vers l'oued Biskra ou la construction de trois ponts qui enjambent l'oued, ont permis d'englober la banlieue de Chetma, à sept kilomètres à l'est dans l'agglomération de Biskra.\n\nCulture et patrimoine\nPatrimoine\nBiskra est une ville ancienne, bien que les vestiges historiques sont peu nombreux. Les ruines des thermes de la ville romaine sont encore visibles sur la rive gauche de l'oued Biskra.\nIl subsiste le fort turc sur la colline au nord et le mausolée Sidi Zarzour sur un rocher au milieu de l'oued. Les sept villages pré-coloniaux, linéaires, sont entièrement insérés dans la palmeraie.\nLa ville abrite plusieurs édifices datant de l'époque coloniale française : le siège de l'ancienne mairie ; l'hôtel du Sahara construit en terre en 1851, premier hôtel de Biskra ; l'hôtel Victoria ; l'hôtel de l'Europe ; l'hôtel Transatlantique, restauré et non classé ; dar Bengana ; dar El-Bey ; maison Caseneuve ; maison Crespin ; maison de Clara Sheridan ; école des Allées et café André-Gide.\nÀ proximité, le conquérant arabe Oqba Ibn Nafaa est enterré sous la coupole de la vieille mosquée qui porte son nom. Cette mosquée passe pour être l'une des plus anciennes d'Algérie.\n\nGastronomie\nLa cuisine de Biskra se compose de nombreux plats, dont le mhajeb dit localement Mahdjouba, la Dobara ou la Chakhchoukha.\n\nLangues\nSituée dans la périphérie des Aurès, Biskra est une ville arabophone, mais il existe une minorité berbérophone. Le chaoui est ainsi parlé par les « djebailis »: population venue s'installer dans la ville à la suite de l'exode rural. Depuis les années 1980, marquées par le printemps berbère, il y a eu un réveil identitaire amazigh dans la région qui se traduit par la promotion du parler chaoui chez les Djebailis.\n\nMusique\nUn centre consacré aux grandes traditions musicales qui se sont maintenues à Biskra, a été ouvert. Il inclut les praticiens de plusieurs styles : la musique diwane, les sonneurs de cornemuses, les joueurs de gasbas et les ensembles de chants religieux soufis.\nLa musique diwane est une musique traditionnelle pratiquée par les populations d'origine africaine, qui a connu un dynamise ces dernières décennies. Le diwân de Biskra utilise un instrument qui lui est exclusif, le qouretou, une petite percussion. D'autres musiques sont pratiquées : le chant bédouin (aiyai), le raï ainsi que la musique chaouie et le malouf.\n\nMusées\nLa ville abrite un musée consacré à la Guerre d'Algérie et notamment à la Wilaya VI historique, baptisé Mohamed Chaâbani en 2009.\n\nFêtes\nDe nombreuses fêtes y sont célébrées, soit religieuses ou culturelles, comme l'Aïd al-Adha, l'Aïd el-Fitr, Yennayer (le nouvel an berbère), la fête des dattes en novembre et la fête du printemps.\n\nÉconomie\nSecteur tertiaire\nLe secteur domine les activés économique à Biskra et occupe la majorité des actifs. Le potentiel de consommation et son statut administratif ont favorisé la prépondérance du secteur tertiaire.\nLa ville est une grande place commerciale, centre de collecte des dattes, point de redistribution des marchandises pour le Sud algérien. Ses commerçants grossistes commercent avec l'Europe, et rayonnent sur tout l'Est algérien.\n\nIndustrie\nBiskra est dotée d'une zone industrielle, située à l'ouest de la ville : filature de laine, unité de chaussures, câbles, téléphones, énergie et industries chimiques et plastiques (articles injectés, colles et adhésifs, articles à usage médical). La majorité des unités industrielles de la wilaya est concentrée au niveau de cette zone.\nLe secteur s'est développé dans les années 1980-90, grâce aux unités nationales de la câblerie et du textile (ENICAB et ELATEX). Guedila, est une marque d'eau minérale en bouteille, dont le siège social est basé dans la commune de Djemorah.\nLe Premier ministre, Abdelmalek Sellal a inauguré, en octobre 2015, une usine de production d'hypochlorite de soude et dérivés par électrolyse du sel, la cimenterie de Djemoura.\n\nAgriculture\nBiskra dispose d'une palmeraie ancienne, et importante de 100 000 palmiers. Quelques cultures maraîchères se pratiquent aujourd'hui surtout en périphérie de la ville. On trouve aussi certaines plantes dites rustiques (olivier, figuier et grenadier) réparties à travers les palmeraies. Toutefois, l'agriculture n'occupe qu'une petite minorité des actifs.\nLes dattes de certaines régions de la wilaya de Biskra notamment de Tolga, de la variété deglet nour sont exportées à l'extérieur du pays.\n\nTourisme\nLa station thermale de Hammam Salihine est située à 7 km au nord-ouest de la ville. Le Jardin des Zibans, est le plus grand parc aquatique nord-africain.\nLa ville a attiré 12 844 touristes en 2014, soit une augmentation de 60 % par rapport à 2013.\n\nVie quotidienne\nEnseignement supérieur\nL'université de Biskra est composée de six facultés et un institut.\n\nSports\nLa ville compte un club de football l'Union sportive de Biskra (USB), un club de tennis situé dans le centre-ville juste à côté la wilaya, et un club de basket-ball, le Makarem Biskra (MB Biskra).\n\nRelations internationales\nLa ville de Biskra est jumelée avec :\n\n Maubeuge (France)\n Tourcoing (France)\n Doha (Qatar)\n\nFestivals et salons\nEn mars 2012, la wilaya a accueilli le premier salon national de la commercialisation des légumes et des épices.\n\nPersonnalités liées à la commune\nAbd al-Rahman Al-Akhdari, un savant majeur de l’école malikite, mathématicien\nTayeb El Oqbi, un ouléma algérien originaire de Sidi Oqba membre de l'Association des oulémas musulmans algériens, un des plus grands réformateurs auprès de Ibn Badis\nAhmed Reda Houhou, écrivain et martyr algérien, le premier écrivain algérien à avoir fait paraître un roman en langue arabe\nAboubaker Djaber el Djazaïri, était un érudit islamique sunnite algérien.\nMohamed Khider, homme politique, militant pendant la guerre d’indépendance et membre fondateur du Comité révolutionnaire d'unité et d'action\nMohamed Chabani, combattant algérien pendant la guerre d’indépendance, il devient colonel  de la wilaya VI, puis devient colonel à la tête de la wilaya VI.\nAhmed Ben Abderrazak Hamouda, dit colonel Si El Haouès combattant durant la révolution algérienne.

A very important thing you need to be alert to is the risk of getting scammed. When people find out that you’re a tourist they will try to increase the bills, even in hotels or motels. Taxi drivers will also charge a high price. So try to look less like a tourist and don’t show a large amount of cash or wear expensive accessories. Hide your valuables.\n\n## Stay healthy\nAs with Algeria in general, medical staff are decent and very well educated, but the public hospitals are usually basic. If you get ill, try to get to a private clinic — these are better-equipped and more modern - charges are modest by European standards.\n\n## Respect\nAs in all of North Africa, the dominant religion in Algeria is Islam, and appropriate religious prohibitions and attitudes should be in order.

          "title": "Béjaïa",
          "content": "Béjaïa ( bij-EYE-ə; Arabic: بجاية, romanized: Bijāya, pronounced [biˈdʒaːja], locally [ˈb(d)ʒæːjə]), formerly known as Bougie and Bugia, is a Mediterranean port city and commune on the Gulf of Béjaïa in Algeria; it is the capital of Béjaïa Province.\n\nGeography\nLocation\nBéjaïa owes its existence to its port, which also makes it prosperous. It is located in a sickle-shaped bay protected from the swell of offshore winds (northwest facing) by the advance of Cape Carbon (to the west of the city). The city is backed by Mount Gouraya located in a northwest position. This port site, in one of the most beautiful bays of the Maghreb and Mediterranean coast, is dominated in the background by the Babors mountain range. Another advantage is that the city is the outlet of the Soummam valley, a geographical corridor facing southwest. However, since the time when the city was a capital, there has been a divorce between the city and the region (Kabylia) linked to the difficulty of securing a hinterland. On a macro-regional scale, the city has its back to the region: its position at the end of the Soummam places it at the interface between Grande and Petite Kabylie. But these two groups are closed in on themselves and seek inland capitals (Tizi Ouzou, Akbou, Kherrata, etc.) by turning away from the coast. The city has, in a way, weak local roots; the rural proximity of the city is limited to four or five communes. On a micro-regional scale, Béjaïa is the outlet of a central Algeria, going from Algiers to Skikda, the spillway of the Highlands and a supply port for two million people. But the connection is complex: to the south-east, trade with Sétif is only possible through the steep gorges of Kherrata; another route takes the Soummam, then to the east the Iron Gates and the climb towards Bordj Bou Arreridj, it is this route that is taken by the national road and the railway. These topographical constraints mean that, despite its strong dynamism, the city sees part of the trade escape it in its eastern and western areas of influence.\nThe town is overlooked by the mountain Yemma Gouraya. Other nearby scenic spots include the Aiguades beach and the Pic des Singes (Peak of the Monkeys); the latter site is a habitat for the endangered Barbary macaque, which prehistorically had a much broader distribution than at present. All three of these geographic features are located in the Gouraya National Park.\n\nThe urban area covers an area of 12,022 hectares. Béjaïa is located 220 km east of the capital Algiers, 93 km east of Tizi Ouzou, 81.5 km northeast of Bordj Bou Arreridj, 70 km northwest of Sétif and 61 km west of Jijel. The geographic coordinates of the commune at the central point of its capital are 36° 45′ 00″ North and 5° 04′ 00″ East, respectively.\n\nToponymy\nBéjaïa is transliteration from an Arabic toponym derived from the Berber toponym (Kabyle variant) Bgayet, notably by transliteration (see Transcription and transliteration) of the sound ǧ in dj (ج). This Berber name — which would have originally been Tabgayet, but whose initial t marking the feminine gender would have fallen into disuse — would come from the words tabegga, tabeɣayt, meaning \"wild brambles and blackberries\".  In Tifinagh script, the name of the city is ⴱⴳⴰⵢⴻⵜ (Bgayet). · \nThe name Béjaïa would thus originally have the same Berber root as other names of cities in the Maghreb, such as Dougga (Thouga) and Béja (Vaga) in Tunisia or Ksar Baghaï (Bagaï) in the Aurès.\nIn medieval Romance languages, Bugaya (from Arabic Bugāya; in Spanish Bujía and in Italian Bugía is the name given to the city, which supplied a large quantity of beeswax for the manufacture of candles. Bougie became the French form of this transcription of the Arabic name. Gradually it came to refer to the wax that was imported in the Middle Ages for the manufacture of candles in Europe; they are from then on commonly designated in French by the word \"bougie\". This in turn is carried over to the word Bugia, meaning a long-handled candlestick used by Catholic bishops and high-ranking priests.\n\nClimate and hydrography\nThe city is part of the Soummam's drainage basin. Béjaïa and the lower Soummam Valley enjoy a Mediterranean climate. It is generally humid with a slight seasonal temperature change. Average temperatures are generally mild and vary from 11.1 °C in winter to 24.5 °C in summer.\nIn addition to the Soummam River, which sufficiently meets agricultural needs in the surroundings of the city, Béjaïa is located in the maritime Kabylie and benefits from a fairly favorable rainfall compared to the rest of the country. The rainfall in the region can range from 800 mm to 1,200 mm, but some local sources tend to be depleted due to increased demand. The city also draws its water resources from the mountainous hinterland and from various springs, such as that of Toudja, which was connected in ancient times by an aqueduct to the ancient city (Saldae).\n\nRoadside and rail communications\nThe city of Béjaïa is linked to Algiers, Tizi Ouzou, Bouira, Sétif, Jijel and several Kabyle localities by an important road network. It has a bus station. Bus lines connect it to the cities of the Algerian south, including Hassi Messaoud, Ouargla, Ghardaïa, Laghouat, Djelfa and Bou Saâda.\nThe commune of Béjaïa is served by several national roads. Some of them run through valleys and gorges that constitute natural passage areas: national road 9 (Sétif road), which passes along the coast then the Kherrata gorges to Sétif, and national road 24 (Béjaïa road), which crosses the Soummam valley, Bouira, then Algiers to the west, or Bordj Bou Arreridj to the east. Others run through steeper terrain: national road 12 (Tizi Ouzou road), passing through the Yakouren forest and its mountains then Azazga, Tizi-Ouzou to Boumerdès, and national road 75 (Batna road), passing through Barbacha and the mountains of Petite Kabylie to reach Sétif and join the Highlands to Batna. A highway construction project is underway to ease congestion on the Béjaïa road, the main axis between the capital and the east of the country, and to connect the city and its port, one of the most important in Algeria, to the Algerian East-West highway.\nBéjaïa has a railway station, the terminus of the Beni Mansour-Bejaia line, created in 1889 and on which a railcar runs linking the stations in the region: Beni Mansour, Tazmalt, Allaghan, Akbou, Lazib Ben Cherif, Ighzer Amokrane, Takriets, Sidi Aich, Ilmaten and El Kseur, The interconnection, at Beni Mansour, with the Algiers-Skikda line, allows access to the entire Algerian railway network by direct links to the Algerian capital, to the west, and to Sétif, to the south-east. A regional train specifically linking Béjaïa to its outskirts is also in service; it was designed to open up the east of the region. The line would benefit from about fifteen daily round trips and should serve the stations of the Beni Mansour-Bejaia line. Bejaia has an international airport located 5 km south of the city. It was first called \"Bejaia - Soummam Airport\" between 1982 and 1999, named after the Soummam River which flows into the Mediterranean near Bejaia. It was inaugurated in 1982 for domestic flights and in 1993 for international flights. It was renamed \"Bejaia - Soummam - Abane Ramdane Airport\" in 1999, in homage to the Algerian politician who played a key role in the history of the Algerian War of Independence.\n\nHistory\nPrehistory\nThe presence of man is attested in various urban and peri-urban sites. The Ali Bacha cave station would represent the oldest settlement site around 40,000 to 20,000 BC. On the Aiguades site, the equipment and furniture found evoke a period around 10,000 BC and therefore Neolithic. The region is also rich in archaeological deposits such as the Afalou caves where some of the oldest burials of modern men, known as Mechta-Afalou men, have been found, which testifies to a culture focused on compassion with the burial of individuals in cave-sanctuary-necropolises and the use of clay pottery dated from 18,000 to 11,000 BC. These deposits are typical of the so-called Iberomaurusian archaeological culture.\n\nAntiquity and Byzantine era\nThe city contains remains from the Bronze Age. The oldest known remains are a \"hanout\" which is a form of Libyc tomb. Long attributed to the Punic culture, it is in fact much older, its dating is interdetermined.\nThe advantageous site, sheltered from the winds by Cape Carbon, was surely occupied very early. The first trace of historical mention appears in the 5th century BC in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax. The region was part of the kingdom of Numidia. In addition, the Punic influence is present: the Carthaginians traveled the North African coasts to trade and establish trading posts called emporioe.\nJugurtha's defeat by the Romans changed the latter's alliance into a suzerainty; Augustus divided the territory into provinces constituting Caesarean Mauretania, and, according to Pliny the Elder, Saldae (the ancient name of the city) was a Roman colony founded with the first annexations in 33 BC. Eight years later, he returned the province of the city to the Numidian king Juba II in compensation for his hereditary states. The city acquired a predominantly Latin culture and was Christianized. The Romans set up various hydraulic networks that would be reused centuries later in the Hammadid era. The Toudja aqueduct dates from the reign of Antoninus Pius. But the city did not know the importance of the development of Hippo (Annaba), which flourished more under the Romans.\n\nAugustus also founded Tubusuptus, the current ruins of Tiklat, a few kilometres away on the banks of the Nasava (Soummam). From the 1st century, the revolt of Tacfarinas involved all the Numidian populations of the region; he invested the Soummam valley, took Tiklat and reached Saldae. He was finally pushed back by the proconsul Publius Cornelius Dolabella. In the 4th century, in the mountains near Saldae, Firmus gathered the \"Quinquegentians\" (current Kabyle tribes of Djurdjura) and led them against the Romans. Count Theodosius arrived with troops from Europe to put down the revolt; he had difficulty overcoming the insurgents.\nThe Vandals in turn entered North Africa from Spain in 429. Led by Genseric, they carried iron to all the coastal towns. They made Saldae the capital of their new state until the capture of Carthage in 439. The struggles between the supporters of Arianism and those of Catholicism weakened the entire region; the Byzantines then found there a pretext and an opportunity to intervene. The city then fell under Byzantine domination in the Vandalic War in 533. The heavy Byzantine oppression also soon gave rise to the population's desire for revolt until the Arab conquest of North Africa.\n\nMuslim and feudal rulers\nThe Arab Conquest\nSeen by the Umayyad Arab conquerors who came from Kairouan, the mountains around Béjaïa were nicknamed el 'adua (\"the enemy\") to designate the stubborn resistance they were the seat of. Information on this period is scattered, or contradictory; it seems that the city was conquered relatively late, around the year 708. An unlikely hypothesis would have it that the name Béjaïa comes from this period from the Arabic word بقاية (Baqâyâ,  \"the remains, the survivors\") because it would have served as a fallback for the Christian and Jewish populations of Constantine and Sétif. According to Ibn Khaldun, the name Béjaïa would rather come from that of the tribe that inhabited the city: the \"Bedjaïa\".\nThe three centuries that followed the conquest are obscure due to the lack of accounts. The city was part of the Aghlabid territory, then that of the Fatimids, under whose rule it experienced a certain effervescence. It seems that when the Hammadid sovereign Nasir founded his capital al-Nasirya there, in 1067, the monuments of ancient Saldae were in ruins. Several hypotheses supported by local traditions explain this state: the city would have experienced 7 earthquakes or a similar number of enemy attacks. It seems established that in the 10th century, the city was in the hands of the Sanhaja Berbers, from whom came the Zirid and Hammadid dynasties which reigned over the Central Maghreb. It is then a town essentially populated by Andalusis, in accordance with the description given by the Andalusi geographer al-Bakri, before the policy of the Hammadids gave a decisive boost to the city.\n\nBerber Dynasties: The Glory of a Medieval Capital\nIn the 10th century, the city was only a small fishing port. In 1067, the Berber sovereign of the Hammadid dynasty, Nasir ibn Alnas (1062-1088), ruling over the Central Maghreb, developed the city and made it his capital. Indeed, his first capital, the Qal'a of Banu Hammad, in the Highlands, was under threat from raids by the Hilalian Arab nomads who, hailing from the Middle East, had launched a second wave of Arab invasions into the Maghreb. He gave the city the name al-Nasiriya, which it would struggle to keep in the face of its toponym Béjaïa, which was already well established in usage. As Ibn Khaldun reports, this is due to the fact that the toponym Bejaïa is linked to the name of the Berber tribe populating this place.\nBefore acquiring its status as capital, the city experienced remarkable dynamism, particularly on the cultural level; it was in fact the port at the crossroads of the Qal'a of Banu Hammad, and al-Andalus. Scholars and traders passed through it and it was the outlet of the triq sultan, the royal road from the High Plateaus to the Mediterranean and even an outlet for trans-Saharan trade. The Kalbid emirs of Sicily were inspired by the palaces of Bejaïa to establish those of Palermo. The city, more than a recognized or appreciated place, was a place of obligatory passage; It is a real crossroads on the road from al-Andalus to the East (especially for pilgrims going to Mecca) but also from Europe to Africa. It is a place of meetings and exchanges of knowledge between local communities, from Europe and the East.\n\nThe establishment of the Hammadid sovereigns will make it the capital of the Central Maghreb and the Algerian madinat at tarikh (the city of history). An original political fact on the scale of the ancient Maghreb, it is a coastal capital. It becomes one of the main cultural and scientific centers of the western Mediterranean and an important commercial center for Europe. If the precise state of the Bougiotte merchant fleet is unknown, it occupies a significant place in the Mediterranean without however being preponderant compared to the European merchant fleets. It is frequented by Latin merchants, Pisans and Genoese, Andalusis and later Catalans. These traders from the south of Europe gave it various names in Romance languages: Bugia, Buzia, Bugea, Buzana. It was at this time that the city's wax, exported to Europe for the making of candles, gave the word \"bougie\" to French and the word \"basane\" to designate skins; lexical borrowing of the transcribed names of the city (respectively Bougie and Buzana). The city exported beeswax and skins in quantity, tannic barks for working leather (the iscorzia di Bugiea was famous in the 14th century), alum, cereals, raisins, wool and cotton from Biskra and M'sila, metals and pottery. The city also imported various goods such as metals, fabric, dyes and medicinal herbs. It was also a naval base for the Hammadids, and the starting point for naval expeditions to the \"country of Rum\" (from which Sicily was three days' sailing). The Hammadid fleet played an important role in the western Mediterranean; it slowed down European advances, particularly those of the Normans of Sicily in the 12th century. The Hammadids attracted scholars from all backgrounds and practiced an open policy, particularly towards Europe. Jews and Christians benefited from favorable conditions; the Emir Nasir maintained regular correspondence with Pope Gregory VII and asked him to appoint a bishop for his city. The arrival of scholars made Béjaïa a leading city in the field of science; its influence extended beyond the Mediterranean and reached Europe. An Andalusian culture mixed with traditional oriental inspiration, secular sciences developed as did sacred sciences. Unlike the Qal'a in the hinterland, it is considered a cultural and \"modern\" city for its time; A \"Berber city living in the oriental style\", many illustrious scholars came from it or settled there throughout its medieval period: Al Madani (10th century), Ibn Hammad, Yahia Zwawi, Leonardo Fibonacci (12th century), Ramon Llull and Ibn Khaldun (13th century).\nScholars came to complete their training in the city as they did in Cairo, Tunis or Tlemcen. Hundreds of students, some of European origin, crowded into the schools and mosques where theologians, jurists, philosophers and scholars taught. The main places of medieval knowledge were the Great Mosque, Madinat al-`Ilm (the City of Sciences), the Khizana Sultaniya and the Sidi Touati Institute. The jurist Al Ghobrini (1246-1314), qadi of the city, described the scholars of Béjaïa as \"princes of science\", among whom were Abu Madyan, Abd al-Haq al-Isbili, al-Qurashi and Abu Tamim Ben Gebara. These scholars met in audiences where they consulted on various subjects.\n\nThere is a rivalry and intellectual exchanges between Tlemcen, the Zeneta and Béjaïa, the Sanhaja.  This tolerance of the city is nuanced by one of the versions of the story of the death of Ramon Llull. Indeed, according to one version, he was stoned by the Bougiotes who had accused him of wanting to convert them to Christianity when other versions affirm that he was simply shipwrecked on his return to Mallorca from Tunis.\nIn 1202, Leonardo Fibonacci, an Italian mathematician, brought back the \"Arabic numerals\" and the algebraic notation. According to the versions, the inspiration for the Fibonacci sequence would be due to the observation of beekeepers and the reproduction of bees in the region or to a local mathematical problem concerning the reproduction of rabbits that he describes in his work  Liber abaci.\nAt that time the city had developed so much that, according to Leo Africanus, it was populated by several tens of thousands of people from all over the Maghreb, the Levant, Europe and Asia. The indigenous population of the city was mainly composed of Berbers from the Kabyle hinterland and the large community of Andalusian refugees. The population estimate at that time is put at 100,000 inhabitants by Al Idrissi. Mohammad Ibn Tumart met Abd al-Mu'min, the one who would become the caliph of his movement and of a new state (the Almohads), near Béjaïa around 1118.\nMohammad Ibn Tumart preached a return to the sources of Islam from Mellala, a town located 10 km from Béjaïa. Years before, the Almohad guide was said to have been driven out by the people of Bejaia, whom he had strongly criticized for their morals. The political movement he founded was the basis of the Almohad Empire, which seized Bejaia in 1152 and deposed the Hammadids. The city retained its strategic importance under the Almohads; it became a provincial capital. The caliph Abd el Mumin appointed a member of his own family as governor of the city, a testament to its strategic importance. The city's port housed the caliph's fleet and that of the Hammadids, which he had seized. In 1183, for a brief period, the Banu Ghaniya (remnants of the Almoravid dynasty) seized Bejaia before the Almohads regained control of it.\nAfter the breakup of the Almohad Empire, Béjaïa returned to the orbit of the Hafsid Berbers of Tunis who became independent in June 1228. But in reality, due to the fragmentation and succession disputes, the emir or sultan of Béjaïa became independent from that of Tunis at the head of a real dissident kingdom over various periods, the last of which before the Spanish conquest extended over the entire 15th century, at which time it was called the \"kingdom de Bougie \". Trade remained active with the Christian states and the city was one of the main reception points for Andalusian refugees fleeing the Reconquista.\n\nThe centuries of decadence of Bejaia\nLike the tragic fate suffered at the turn of the 15th century by many caravanserais and several medieval cities of the Sahara and the Maghreb coast, sometimes radically, those characterized by an economy significantly linked to trans-Saharan-Mediterranean trade as well as by a lack of substitutes inherently or de facto (such as Mahdia in Tunisia, Honaïne in Algeria, radically Sijilmasa in Morocco, etc.), Bejaia thus begins its decline in this context of a combination of circumstances of reconfiguration of world trade in favor of new maritime routes dominated at first by the Portuguese and the Dutch to the detriment of the previous caravan routes and what was related to them.\n\nA coveted city\nThe Spanish, in the wake of the Reconquista, carried out raids on the ports of North Africa. The city was taken by the Spaniard Pedro Navarro in 1510 from Sultan Abdelaziz. The Spanish put an end to the \"kingdom of Bougie\" in the central Maghreb. They made the city one of their trading posts which was maintained thanks to relations with Pisa and Genoa. But their harshness caused the flight of the local population, and conflicts with the surrounding Berbers. The city could no longer serve as a relay for trade with the hinterland and Abu Bakr, Abdelaziz's brother and sultan, tried to retake the city in 1512 from his new capital, Constantine (using the Zianid siege system of the 14th century).\nThe Spanish were content to control a perimeter forming a sort of triangle between Bordj Abdelkader, the Casbah and Bordj Moussa. The city outside these limits was not defendable by the weak Spanish garrison and was ruined. The spirit of the Inquisition influenced local Spanish politics, the Jews were driven out of the city and the urban elites, including the scholars, fled. The scholarly tradition then moved massively to the zaouïas of the Kabyle hinterland, the manuscripts were also moved and dispersed. The population of the city was in free fall, and even the Spanish garrison was increasingly reduced; it numbered 500 men in 1555.\nThe former possessions of Béjaïa were fragmented, which hindered the reconquest of the city. In Kabylie, El Abbès, the son of the Sultan of Béjaïa, founded his principality around the Kalâa of Ait Abbès, taking part of the city's elites; on the west bank of the Soummam he was in competition with Belkadi, descendant of the Bougiote jurist Al Ghobrini who founded the Sultanate of Kuku. In Constantine it was Abou Bakr, brother of the former sultan, who proclaimed himself sultan over all of eastern Algeria. These various protagonists, rivals among themselves, each hoped to reconquer the city and unify its former dependencies.\n\nIt was at this time, when the old states were in decline, that the Barbarossa brothers, Greek corsairs converted to Islam, appeared and settled in the neighboring city of Jijel. They joined the various attempts to retake the city from the Spanish thanks to their expertise in navigation. They eventually founded their own state around Algiers, based partly on corsair activity, and rapidly extended their influence over northern Algeria by gradually entering the Ottoman orbit and presenting themselves in the eyes of the population as direct competitors of the Spanish. Béjaïa quickly became a strategic objective; the Barbarossa gradually ousted the Hafsids from Constantine and Annaba. Charles V used the city as a fallback after the disastrous 1541 expedition against Algiers.\n\nA marginalized city\nThe Barbarossa would never achieve their goal of retaking Béjaïa during their lifetime. It was one of their successors, the beylerbey Salah Raïs, who finally entered the city after the Battle of Béjaïa (1555) with the help of the Kabyles of Koukou. The city was integrated into the Regency of Algiers and depended on the Beylik of Constantine until 1830. The territorial division into three beyliks placed the city in a marginal position. The political dream of the Barbarossa to establish their capital in Béjaïa was abandoned; the regency was already established in Algiers, which was a fortified port and in which many developments had been carried out. The only major institution maintained during this period was that of the dar senâa, the shipyards or arsenals of the city which supplied ships to the regency. \n\nThe city, with a Turkish caïd, was seen above all as a city that could potentially compete with Algiers and is surrounded by hostile mountains. The rise of its corsair fleets was closely monitored for fear of competition with that of Algiers; the Algiers fleet came to its coves, where it was naturally sheltered, during the winter. The city therefore saw its decline accelerate after the departure of the Spanish. The inhabitants maintained a small merchant fleet of about twenty feluccas which traded with Algiers, Oran, Bouna and Tunis to export the region's produce during favorable weather. In winter, this fleet was stationed on the beach of Dar senâa under the Casbah and not refloated until spring. The goods exported included oil, wax, dried figs, and leather; fabrics and cereals are imported. These ships could transport wood for the karasta: the exploitation of wood for the shipbuilding of Algiers. Corsair activity continued during this period, particularly with that of Jijel. In 1671, the city was targeted by the English led by Edward Spragge who bombarded it to stop the corsair attacks on their ships. During this entire period, the city was not maintained, and the descriptions of various travelers reflect the deterioration of the buildings and the lack of repair. Sidi M'hamed Amokrane, a marabout, son of the Sultan of Aït Abbas, Sidi Naceur Amokrane (or Mokrani), settled near Béjaïa around 1630, before going to Jijel. He moved his zaouïa from the village of Ama'dan to the city where the Turks charged him with running the karasta. At the time of Al Warthilani (1713 – 1779), the city was in the hands of three important figures: the cadi, the caid and the descendant of the marabout Mokrani.\nThe caids asked the marabouts to pass under the laânaya (protection) of the troops of Béjaïa until Algiers. Indeed, the city located in the heart of Kabylie, independent of the executive power of Algiers, was often besieged during insurrectional conflicts between the various confederations of the region. During the great revolt of 1806, led by the sheriff Ben el Harche, the city was besieged without success. In 1823, the tribes of Bibans and Soummam seized the caid of the city. In 1825, the agha Yahia, commander of the troops from Algiers, invaded the city and launched operations of repression against the tribes of Soummam.\n\nThe fall of the regency and the colonial period\nIn 1830, the French launched the conquest of Algeria. At first, the expedition was directed against Algiers. But very soon, the invaders sought to occupy the entire country, in particular Kabylie against which several expeditions were directed. Béjaïa, which had come under the control of the Mezzaïa tribe after the fall of the dey of Algiers, was involved in several incidents with French and British ships. In 1831, two expeditions aimed at imposing as its caïd a man named Mourad, then a certain Bou Setta, were thwarted. A new expedition resulted in the capture of the city in 1833, after fierce resistance from its inhabitants. However, the French failed to conquer the surrounding area.\n\nThe city and its region put up fierce resistance to the French colonial presence; moreover, like the Spanish in the 16th century, the French were content with a limited occupation until 1846. Various defensive works were built around the square, particularly on the heights.\nThe city took part in several uprisings and insurrections, such as that of the sheriff Boubaghla, and especially the great revolt of Sheikh El Mokrani and Sheikh Aheddad in 1871. At the time of the French conquest, the city was no more than a very modest town of around 2,000 inhabitants. The city was made a fully-fledged commune by decree of 17 June 1854. The French partially filled in the bay and developed the city's port and outer harbor. Urban planning work (development of the seafront and major roads) left its mark on its urban fabric. It gradually regains its role as an outlet for Kabylia, and as an export port for local agricultural products. Algerian inhabitants still maintain their coastal shipping activity. In 1906, the Cape Carbon lighthouse was built, it is the highest in the world due to its natural location (altitude 220 meters) and it has a range of 33 miles.\nDuring World War II, Operation Torch landed forces in North Africa, including a battalion of the British Army's Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment at Béjaïa on 11 November 1942. That same day, at 4:40 PM, a German Luftwaffe air raid struck Béjaïa with thirty Ju 88 bombers and torpedo planes. The transports Awatea and Cathay were sunk and the monitor HMS Roberts was damaged. The following day, the anti-aircraft ship SS Tynwald was torpedoed and sank, while the transport Karanja was bombed and destroyed.\nOn May 8, 1945, the repression led by the French colonial forces in Kherrata, where the navy was used for a naval bombardment of the coasts of the Béjaïa region, caused thousands of victims.\nDuring the Algerian War of Independence, the organization of the FLN and the ALN created for the first time a Kabyle administrative territory, the wilaya III; Béjaïa is part of this group. The Soummam congress, which is the political meeting of the FLN which sets the political-military line of the Algerian national movement in the war, takes place in Ouzellaguen, in the Bougiote hinterland.\n\nThe modern agglomeration\nOn the eve of the Algerian War in 1954, it had 30,000 inhabitants, including 6,200 Europeans. One of the last decisions of the colonial administration was to build an oil pipeline from Hassi Messaoud, with the city as a terminal depot and oil port. In 1959, Béjaïa was the most important oil port in Algeria, which was a source of income. In 1962, it was integrated into the wilaya of Sétif, before becoming the seat of its own wilaya in 1974. The city experienced a demographic boom, and an urbanization of the Lekhmis plain, following the influx of rural people, particularly from Kabylie.\nBéjaïa, like other cities in Soummam, was one of the centers of Berber identity claims during the Berber Spring of 1980; and in 2001, during the Black Spring. If it struggles to establish itself as the economic capital of Little Kabylia, it is undeniably the cultural capital of Kabylia, in competition with Tizi-Ouzou. The opening of the political field has allowed the emergence of groups, associations, artistic and cultural events of all types. The University Center, by its presence, supports the movement; a Tamazight language institute is planned to be installed in Béjaïa.\nThis rapid expansion of the city is also a challenge in terms of urban planning; the city is indeed struggling to ensure a hinterland due to the relief. On the other hand, heritage and culture are also an issue because they are threatened in the long term. The exceptional site also raises the environmental question and that of pollution linked to domestic and industrial activities. In the early 1990s, the increase in population combined with the lack of planning and the inadequacy of public policies degraded the living environment of the city, despite certain assets for its future.\n\nUrban planning\nDowntown\nThe downtown of Béjaïa comprises the colonial quarter and the old town, the medina, itself largely reshaped by urban planning during the Spanish Empire and later by French Algeria. The old town is nestled against the Gouraya massif; it was marked by the Spanish presence, during which it lost numerous medieval buildings (such as the Hammadid Palace of the Star), and then by French developments. This area, however, is not lacking in ancient (particularly archaeological) or medieval buildings and remains; the Acherchour, Karamane, and Bab El Louz districts still boast Moorish houses. But due to a lack of maintenance, public awareness, and preservation, the introduction of inauthentic materials (concrete, brick, etc.) threatens this heritage. The city's defensive structures are still present in various locations within the old town (Bab el Bounoud, the Hammadid wall near the port, the Casbah, etc.). The colonial part of the city is particularly notable for the seafront district, which encroaches upon part of the old town and the port. Inspired by Haussmannian architecture, it also includes the famous Place du 1er Novembre, still known as Place Geydon.\n\nDemographics\nThe population of the city was 177,988 as of the 2008 census.\n\nEconomy\nThe northern terminus of the Hassi Messaoud oil pipeline from the Sahara, Béjaïa is an oil exporting port. Other exports include iron ore, phosphates, and wine. The city also has a cork industry.\nCevital, the largest private conglomerate in Algeria, is headquartered in the city.\n\nSports\nThe city is home to football clubs JSM Béjaïa and MO Béjaïa.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nBéjaïa has an official friendly relationship with:\n\n Glasgow, Scotland, since 1995\n Brest\n Bad Homburg\n\nVillages\nIlougane\n\nNotable people\nZaki Hannache (born 1987), human rights activist\nNihad Hihat (born 1994), volleyball player\nRebiha Khebtani (1926–2006), politician\nNassim Oussalah (born 1981), footballer\nFares Arfa (born 1994), fencer\n\nSee also\nEuropean enclaves in North Africa before 1830\nList of lighthouses in Algeria\nSaldae, for Roman history and concurrent Catholic titular see\nGreat Mosque of Béjaïa\nRelated people\nAbu al-Salt\nFibonacci\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nExternal links\n\n(in French) Bgayet.Net\n(in French) History of Béjaïa\nGigaCatholic, with titular incumbent biography links\nGoogle map of Béjaïa",

          "content": "Béjaïa (en kabyle ⴱⴳⴰⵢⵜ, Bgayet ; en arabe بجاية, Biǧāya, /bid͡ʒaːja/), également appelée anciennement Bougie en français, est une commune algérienne située en bordure de la mer Méditerranée, à 220 km à l'est d'Alger. Elle est le chef-lieu de la wilaya de Béjaïa et de la daïra de Béjaïa, en Kabylie.\nLe site de la ville est peuplé depuis le paléolithique. Les vestiges néolithiques retrouvés dans la région font partie de la culture ibéromaurusienne. La ville est mentionnée dans les sources historiques à partir du Ve siècle av. J.-C. comme faisant partie du monde libyco-berbère. Ouverte aux échanges maritimes, la ville connaitra l'influence et un comptoir phénicien qui la fera connaitre sous le nom de Salda et, à l'époque romaine, sous le nom de Saldae. Les Vandales s'y établissent avant d'abandonner la ville et de transférer leur capitale à Carthage. La ville est islamisée à partir du VIIIe siècle, en effet elle est prise tardivement par les Arabes en 708, puis mentionnée au Xe siècle par le géographe andalou Abū ʿUbayd al-Bakrī qui parle d'une présence importante d'Andalous.\nElle devient une prestigieuse capitale, mais également un foyer religieux, commercial et savant de la Méditerranée sous la dynastie des Berbères hammadides au XIe siècle, qui la prennent pour capitale en lieu et place de la Qala'a des Béni Hammad.  Après un intermède almohade, elle redevient la capitale d'une branche des Hafsides puis siège un sultanat indépendant.\nRéputée en Europe pour la qualité de ses chandelles faites de cire d'abeille — auxquelles elle a donné son nom : les bougies — Béjaïa a également joué un rôle important dans la diffusion en Occident des chiffres arabes et des savoirs mathématiques locaux. Au Moyen Âge, des savants comme Raymond Lulle, Leonardo Fibonacci et Ibn Khaldoun y étudient.\nAprès un déclin progressif et relatif amorcé au XVe siècle (du fait notamment de reconfigurations dans le commerce mondial), Bejaïa conquise par les Espagnols en 1510 subit dès lors un net déclin qui se prolongera avec la reconquête par la régence d'Alger en 1555. Elle perd substantiellement sa culture savante ; ses grands établissements d'enseignement ne sont plus, ses grandes personnalités scientifiques n'y sont plus (partis en d'autres grandes cités du Maghreb et du Proche-Orient) ; seule subsiste l'institution théologique décentralisée des zaouïas. Elle est éclipsée, à l’échelle du Maghreb Central, par Alger siège du pouvoir politique et de la marine. Elle continue de tirer un certain prestige de ses mystiques religieux et de l'exportation du bois issu de l'arrière-pays. Elle est prise par les Français en 1833. Elle continue alors son déclin pour n'être plus qu'une ville portuaire moyenne, exportant des productions agricoles locales, puis renoue avec un certain dynamisme à la fin du XIXe siècle.\nLors de l'indépendance du pays, en 1962, elle retrouve un rôle culturel. En effet, grande ville berbérophone, elle devient un des foyers de la revendication identitaire berbère. Elle redevient aussi, progressivement, un port de première importance, talonnant celui d'Alger et devançant Oran.\nAvec ses 177 988 habitants au dernier recensement de 2008, Béjaïa est la plus grande ville de Kabylie et « capitale » de la petite Kabylie. Elle est aussi, grâce à sa situation géographique, le plus important pôle industriel de la région, notamment par la concentration de nombreuses industries, et la présence d'un des plus grands ports pétroliers et commerciaux de Méditerranée. Elle est également dotée d'un aéroport international.\n\nToponymie\nBéjaïa est un toponyme arabe dérivé du toponyme berbère (variante kabyle) Bgayet, notamment par translittération (voir Transcription et translittération) du son ǧ en dj (ج). Ce nom berbère — qui aurait été à l'origine Tabgayet, mais dont le t initial marquant le genre féminin serait tombé en désuétude — serait issu des mots tabegga, tabeɣayt, signifiant « ronces et mûres sauvages », une plante mellifère.\nLe nom de Béjaïa aurait ainsi à l'origine la même racine berbère que d'autres noms de villes du Maghreb, tels que Dougga (Thouga) et Béja (Vaga) en Tunisie ou Ksar Baghaï (Bagaï) dans les Aurès. Le nom de Béjaïa est également celui de la tribu berbère qui peuple le site de la ville, comme rapporté par Ibn Khaldoun, ce qui explique que le nom donné par l'émir hammadide En-Naciriya ne se soit pas pérennisé face à un usage bien ancré. La ville est appelée Bekaïa et se prononce Begaïa chez cette tribu.\nDans les langues romanes médiévales, Bugaya (de l'arabe Bugāya ; en espagnol Bujía et en italien Bugía) est le nom donné à la ville qui fournissait une grande quantité de cire d'abeille pour la fabrication des chandelles. Bougie sera la forme française de cette transcription du nom arabe. Progressivement il va s'appliquer à la désignation de la cire qui était importée au Moyen Âge pour la fabrication des chandelles en Europe ; elles sont dès lors couramment désignées en français par le mot « bougie ».\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nBéjaïa doit son existence à son port qui fait également sa prospérité. Elle est située dans une baie en faucille protégée de la houle des vents du large (orientés nord-ouest) par l'avancée du cap Carbon (à l'ouest de la ville). La ville est adossée au mont du Gouraya situé dans une position nord-ouest. Ce site portuaire, dans l'une des plus belles baies du littoral maghrebin et méditerranéen, est dominé à l'arrière-plan par la chaîne montagneuse des Babors. Un autre avantage est que la ville est le débouché de la vallée de la Soummam, un couloir géographique orienté sud-ouest. Cependant, depuis l'époque où la ville fut une capitale, il existe un divorce entre la ville et la région (Kabylie) lié à la difficulté de s'assurer un arrière-pays. À une échelle macro-régionale, la ville est dos à la région : sa position à l'extrémité de la Soummam la place à l'interface entre Grande et Petite Kabylie. Mais ces deux ensembles sont renfermés sur eux-mêmes et se cherchent des capitales intérieures (Tizi Ouzou, Akbou, Kherrata...) en se détournant du littoral. La ville possède en quelque sorte un faible enracinement local ; les proximité rurales de la ville se limitent à quatre ou cinq communes. À l'échelle micro-régionale, Béjaïa est le débouché d'une Algérie médiane, allant d'Alger à Skikda, déversoir des Hauts-Plateaux et port d'approvisionnement de deux millions de personnes. Mais la liaison est complexe : au sud-est les échanges avec Sétif ne se font qu'à travers les gorges escarpées de Kherrata ; une autre voie emprunte la Soummam, puis à l'est les Portes de Fer et la remontée vers Bordj Bou Arreridj, c'est ce chemin qui est emprunté par la route nationale et la voie ferrée. Ces contraintes topographiques font que, malgré son fort dynamisme, la ville voit une partie des échanges lui échapper sur ses aires d'influences est et ouest.\n\nL'aire urbaine couvre une superficie de 12 022 hectares. Béjaïa est située à 220 km à l'est de la capitale Alger, à 93 km à l'est de Tizi Ouzou, à 81,5 km au nord-est de Bordj Bou Arreridj, à 70 km au nord-ouest de Sétif et à 61 km à l'ouest de Jijel. Les coordonnées géographiques de la commune au point central de son chef-lieu valent respectivement 36° 45′ 00″ Nord et 5° 04′ 00″ Est.\n\nClimat et hydrographie\nLa ville fait partie du bassin versant de la Soummam. Béjaïa et la vallée de la Soummam inférieure bénéficient d'un climat méditerranéen. Il est généralement humide avec un léger changement de température saisonnier. Les températures moyennes sont globalement douces et varient de 11,1 °C en hiver à 24,5 °C en été.\nOutre le fleuve Soummam qui répond suffisamment aux besoins agricoles dans les environs de la ville, Béjaïa est située dans la Kabylie maritime et bénéficie d'une pluviométrie assez favorable comparée au reste du pays. La pluviométrie de la région peut aller de 800 mm à 1 200 mm, mais certaines sources locales tendent à s'épuiser du fait de l'augmentation de la demande. La ville tire également ses ressources hydrauliques de l'arrière-pays montagneux et de diverses sources, comme celle de Toudja qui fut reliée dans l'Antiquité par un aqueduc à la ville antique (Saldae).\n\nRéseaux de communication\nLa ville de Béjaïa est reliée à Alger, Tizi Ouzou, Bouira, Sétif, Jijel et plusieurs localités kabyles par un important réseau routier. Elle possède une gare routière. Des lignes de bus la relient aux villes du grand sud algérien, notamment Hassi Messaoud, Ouargla, Ghardaïa, Laghouat, Djelfa et Bou Saâda.\nLa commune de Béjaïa est desservie par plusieurs routes nationales. Certaines empruntent des vallées et des gorges qui constituent des zones de passage naturelles : la route nationale 9 (route de Sétif), qui passe par le littoral puis les gorges de Kherrata jusqu'à Sétif, et la route nationale 24 (route de Béjaïa), qui traverse la vallée de la Soummam, Bouira, puis Alger à l'ouest, ou Bordj Bou Arreridj à l'est. D'autres empruntent des reliefs plus escarpés : la route nationale 12 (route de Tizi Ouzou), passant par la forêt de Yakouren et ses montagnes puis Azazga, Tizi-Ouzou jusqu'à Boumerdès, et la route nationale 75 (route de Batna), passant par Barbacha et les montagnes de Petite Kabylie pour déboucher à Sétif et rejoindre les Hauts-Plateaux jusqu'à Batna.\nUn projet d’autoroute est en cours de réalisation pour désengorger la route de Béjaïa, axe principal entre la capitale et l'Est du pays, et permettre de relier la ville et son port, l'un des plus importants d'Algérie, à l’autoroute Est-Ouest algérienne.\nBéjaïa possède une gare ferroviaire, terminus de la ligne Beni Mansour-Bejaia, créée en 1889 et sur laquelle circule un autorail reliant les gares de la région : Beni Mansour, Tazmalt, Allaghan, Akbou, Lazib Ben cherif, Ighzer Amokrane, Takriets, Sidi Aich, Ilmaten et El Kseur. L’interconnexion, à Beni Mansour, avec la ligne Alger-Skikda, permet l’accès à l’ensemble du réseau ferroviaire algérien par des liaisons directes à la capitale algérienne, à l’ouest, et à Sétif, au sud-est. Un train régional reliant spécifiquement Béjaïa à sa périphérie est également en service ; il a été conçu pour désenclaver l'est de la région. La ligne bénéficierait d'une quinzaine d'aller-retours quotidiens et devrait desservir les gares de la ligne Beni Mansour-Bejaia.\nBéjaïa dispose d'un aéroport international situé à 5 km au sud de la ville. Il a d'abord été dénommé « aéroport de Béjaïa - Soummam » entre 1982 et 1999, du nom de la Soummam qui se jette dans la Méditerranée à proximité de Béjaïa. Il a été inauguré en 1982 pour les vols nationaux et en 1993 pour les vols internationaux.\nIl a été renommé « aéroport de Béjaïa - Soummam - Abane Ramdane » en 1999, en hommage à l'homme politique algérien qui a joué un rôle essentiel dans l'histoire de la guerre d'indépendance algérienne.\n\nUne ville portuaire\nL'histoire de la ville est liée à son rôle portuaire, connu dès l'Antiquité et notoirement étudié dès la période de la dynastie des Hammadides (berbère médiévale) au XIe siècle. Elle devient un port important munie d'installations, de constructions navales et abrite les escadres des pouvoirs sultaniens successifs qui règnent sur le Maghreb Central (Zirides, Hammadides, Almohades, Hafside). La ville fut dès le XIIe siècle considérée comme l'un des trois emporia principaux du Maghreb, avec Tunis et Ceuta. Elle possède à cette époque des relations avec les marchands latins des trois principales cités de l'Italie médiévale : Pise, Gênes et Venise, les Andalous, puis les Catalans. La bourgeoisie de la ville joue alors le rôle d'intermédiaire entre les populations du Constantinois, elles-mêmes parfois intermédiaires des Sahariens, et la Méditerranée. La crise du commerce au XIVe siècle tourne ensuite le port vers la course en Méditerranée. Entrée sous l'autorité de la régence d'Alger au XVIe siècle, elle est marginalisée au profit de la nouvelle capitale du Maghreb central, Alger, et continue son déclin au point qu'au XIXe siècle, lors de la conquête française, elle n'est plus qu'une petite cité portuaire. Les aménagements coloniaux du port lui permettent de retrouver son rôle naturel de débouché de son arrière-pays, la Kabylie. La décision prise dans les années 1960 de faire parvenir un oléoduc jusque dans la ville va donner un essor définitif à l'activité du port qui devient un port pétrolier de premier plan.\n\nBéjaïa dispose d'un port qui occupe le deuxième rang en Algérie par son volume d'activité, derrière celui de la capitale Alger ; débouché important pour une partie de la production régionale (minerais, vins, figues, prunes et liège), il a donné depuis les années 1960 une place grandissante au pétrole et aux produits pétroliers extraits du sous-sol saharien (les hydrocarbures représentent 86 % de ses exportations en 2005). En 2008, il a été intégré au projet européen des « autoroutes de la mer » (ADM), aux côtés de Gabès, Agadir et Haïfa. Le port est destiné à devenir un hub portuaire de niveau mondial grâce au lancement des travaux de réalisation de la plus importante gare maritime d’Algérie conçue aux normes internationales.\nLe 21 juin 2018, après plus de 5 ans de travaux, la nouvelle gare maritime de Béjaia a été inaugurée avec l'accostage d'un premier car-ferry de la société française «Corsica linéa», transportant à son bord plus d’une centaine de passagers et une soixantaine de véhicules. Construite sur deux sites, l’un à l’intérieur du port et l’autre en zone extra-portuaire, la gare s'étend sur trois niveaux pour une superficie totale de 34 000 m². Depuis, la gare est au cœur d'une polémique. Elle a été construite sur un terrain traversé par un oléoduc. En 2023, le ministre des transports, Kamel Beldjoud, a évoqué une erreur commise lors de la construction de la gare maritime et a proposé le déplacement de l'oléoduc au ministre de l'Energie.\n\nFlore et faune\nLa ville de Béjaïa fait partie de la Corniche kabyle, qui s'étend jusqu'à Jijel et qui constitue un site écologique remarquable. Dans le Nord de la ville, le parc national de Gouraya constitue une aire littorale protégée, qui, avec le parc national de Taza, situé 60 km à l’est de Béjaïa, a été classée par l'UNESCO parmi les « réserves de biosphère mondiales », des zones modèles visant à concilier conservation de la biodiversité et développement durable.\n\nLe parc de Gouraya se distingue par la présence d'euphorbes, espèces très menacées en Méditerranée, de formations de garrigue où se côtoient le chêne kermès et l'olivier sauvage, de spécimens de pin d'Alep, de genévrier et d'absinthe. Dans le parc de Taza, le chêne zéen et le chêne-liège constituent avec le chêne afarès les principales essences qui s’étendent jusqu'à la wilaya de Jijel.\nS'agissant du chêne-liège, dans un pays qui représente plus de la moitié de la superficie occupée par cette essence sur la rive sud de la Méditerranée, la Kabylie et l'ensemble du Nord-Est algérien constituent la région des plus grandes subéraies : elles s'y étendent, le long du littoral, depuis Alger jusqu'à la frontière tunisienne et du bord de mer jusqu'à 1 200 m d'altitude.\nLa faune locale abrite des mammifères telles que le chacal doré, la genette, le sanglier, et des espèces menacées comme le chat sauvage, le porc-épic, le lynx caracal et le macaque berbère ou singe magot, une espèce endémique d'Afrique du Nord. La hyène rayée, la belette, le renard roux, le lièvre brun et le hérisson d'Algérie sont signalés dans le parc de Taza ; le lapin de garenne à Taza et Gouraya. Les montagnes alentour forment l’habitat de plusieurs espèces d'oiseaux dont l'aigle de Bonelli, le vautour fauve, la tourterelle, la perdrix gambra, le hibou grand-duc, la buse féroce, l'aigle royal et le faucon crécerelle. Les hauteurs de Petite Kabylie abritent en outre la sittelle kabyle, espèce de passereau endémique qui n'a été découverte qu'en 1975, sur le mont Babor.\n\nLa faune et la flore marine sont également remarquables. L'aire marine du Gouraya constitue le biotope de quatre espèces protégées de mammifères marins : le marsouin commun, le dauphin commun à bec court , le dauphin souffleur et le grand cachalot. Les fonds marins des parcs recèlent six typologies de paysages d'intérêt écologique international : encorbellements à Lithophyllum lichenoides, trottoirs à vermets, bourrelets à Corallina elongata, forêts à Dictyopteris membranacea, herbiers tigrés à Posidonia oceanica et récifs coralliens à Posidonia oceanica. Les eaux adjacentes au parc de Taza incluent le « banc des Kabyles », classé « aire spécialement protégée d’importance méditerranéenne » (ASPIM) par la convention de Barcelone. Riches d'une communauté de corail en bon état de santé, elles abondent en divers bioindicateurs d’eaux non polluées.\n\nHistoire\nPréhistoire\nLa présence de l'homme est attestée dans divers sites urbains et périrurbains. La station de la grotte d'Ali Bacha représenterait le site le plus ancien de peuplement autour de 40000 à 20000 av. J.-C. Du côté du site des Aiguades, le matériel et le mobilier retrouvé évoquent une période autour de 10000 av. J.-C. et donc néolithique. La région est d'ailleurs riche en gisements archéologique comme les grottes d'Afalou où ont été retrouvé parmi les plus vieilles sépultures d'hommes modernes, dit homme de Mechta-Afalou, qui témoigne d'une culture tournée vers la compassion avec l'inhumation des individus dans des grottes-sanctuaires-nécropoles et l'usage de la poterie en argile datées de 18000 à 11000 av. J.-C.. Ces gisements sont typique de la culture archéologique dite ibéromaurusienne.\n\nAntiquité : les débuts de la ville\nLa ville comporte des vestiges de l'âge du bronze. Le plus ancien vestige connu est un « hanout » qui est une forme de tombe lybique. Longtemps attribuée à la culture punique elle est en fait beaucoup plus ancienne, sa datation est interderminée.\nLe site avantageux, abrité des vents par le cap Carbon, fut sûrement occupé très tôt. La première trace de mention historique apparaît au Ve siècle av. J.-C. dans le Périple du Pseudo-Scylax. La région a fait partie du royaume de Numidie. De plus l'influence punique est présente : les Carthaginois parcourent les côtes nord africaines pour commercer et implanter des comptoirs commerciaux appelés emporioe.\n\nLa défaite de Jugurtha face aux Romains change l'alliance de ces derniers en une suzeraineté ; Auguste découpe le territoire en provinces constituant la Maurétanie césarienne, et, selon Pline l'Ancien, Saldae (nom antique de la ville) est une colonie romaine fondée avec les premières annexions en 33 av. J.-C. Huit ans plus tard, il rétrocède la province de la ville à Juba II en dédommagement de ses États héréditaires. La ville se dote d'une culture à dominante latine et est christianisée. Les Romains mettent en place divers réseaux hydrauliques qui seront réemployés à l'époque hammadide. L'aqueduc de Toudja date du règne de Antonin le Pieux. Mais la ville ne connaît pas l'importance du développement de Hippone (Annaba) plus florissante sous les Romains.Auguste fonde également, à quelques kilomètres sur les rives de la Nasava (Soummam), Tubusuptus, les actuelles ruines de Tiklat. Dès le Ier siècle, la révolte de Tacfarinas entraîne l'ensemble des populations numides de la région ; il investit la vallée de la Soummam, prend Tiklat et arrive jusqu'à Saldae. Il est finalement repoussé par le proconsul Dollabella. Au IVe siècle, dans les montagnes voisines de Saldae, Firmus rassemble les « Quinquegentiens » (actuelles tribus kabyles du Djurdjura) et les mène contre les Romains. Le comte Théodose arrive avec des troupes d'Europe pour mater la révolte ; il vient difficilement à bout des insurgés.\nLes Vandales font à leur tour leur entrée en Afrique du Nord, depuis l'Espagne, en 429. Conduit par Geneseric, ils portent le fer dans toutes les villes du littoral. Ils font de Saldae la capitale de leurs nouveaux États jusqu'en 439 et la prise de Carthage. Les luttes opposant les partisans de l'arianisme à ceux du catholicisme affaiblissent la région tout entière ; les Byzantins y trouvent alors un prétexte et une occasion d'intervenir. La ville bascule alors sous la domination byzantine, dès les conquêtes de Belisaire en 533. L'oppression byzantine, lourde, ne tarde pas également à susciter des velléités de révoltes des populations jusqu'à la conquête arabe de l'Afrique du Nord.\n\nLa conquête arabe\nVues par les conquérants arabes omeyyades venus depuis Kairouan, les montagnes autour de Béjaïa sont surnommées el 'adua (« l'ennemie ») pour désigner la résistance opiniâtre dont elles sont le siège. Les informations sur cette époque sont éparses, ou contradictoires ; il semble que la ville ait été conquise relativement tard, vers l'an 708. Une hypothèse peu probable voudrait que le nom Béjaïa viendrait de cette époque du mot arabe بقاية (Baqâyâ : « les restes, les survivants ») car elle aurait servi de repli aux populations chrétiennes et juives de Constantine et Sétif. Selon Ibn Khaldoun, le nom de Béjaïa serait plutôt issu de celui de la tribu qui habitait la ville : les « Bedjaïa ».\nLes trois siècles qui suivent la conquête sont obscurs faute de récits sur sa situation ; la ville fait partie du territoire aghlabide, puis de celui des Kutama-Fatimide où elle connaît une certaine effervescence. Il semble que lorsque le souverain hammadide An Nasir y fonde sa capitale An Nasirya, en 1067, les monuments de la Saldae antique sont en ruine. Plusieurs hypothèses portées par les traditions locales expliquent cet état : la ville aurait connu 7 tremblements de terre ou encore un nombre similaire d'attaques ennemies.\nIl semble établi qu'au Xe siècle, la ville est aux mains des berbères sanhadja, dont sont issues les dynasties ziride et hammadides qui régneront sur le Maghreb Central. C'est alors une bourgade essentiellement peuplée d'Andalous, conformément à le description qu'en donne le géographe andalou Al Bakri, avant que la politique des Hammadides donne un essor décisif à la ville.\n\nDynasties berbères : la gloire d'une capitale médiévale\nAu Xe siècle, la ville n'est qu'un petit port de pêche. En 1067, le souverain berbère de la dynastie Hammadide, An Nasir (1062 -1088), régnant sur le Maghreb Central, aménage la ville et en fait sa capitale. En effet, sa première capitale, la Qal'a des Beni Hammad, dans les Hauts-Plateaux, est sous la menace des raids des nomades arabes hilaliens qui à partir du Moyen-Orient ont lancé une seconde vague d'invasion arabe sur le Maghreb. Il donne à la ville le nom de An Nasiriya, qu'elle peinera à conserver face à son toponyme Béjaïa déjà bien ancré dans les usages.\nComme le rapporte Ibn Khaldoun, cela est dû au fait que le toponyme Bejaïa est lié a nom de la tribu berbère peuplant ce lieu:\n\n« en l'an 460 (1067-1068), il [En Nacer] s'empara de la montagne de Bedjaia, localité habitée par une tribu berbère du même nom. Chez eux, Bedjaia s'appelle Bekaïa et se prononce Begaia. En Nacer, ayant conquis cette montagne, y fonda une ville à laquelle il donna le nom d'En-Naciriya; mais tout le monde l'appelle Bejaia, du nom de la tribu. »\n\nLa ville connait, avant l’acquisition de son statut de capitale, une dynamique remarquable, notamment sur le plan culturel ; elle est en effet le port à la croisée de la Qal'a des Beni Hammad et de l'Al Andalus. Les lettrés et les commerçants y transitent alors et elle est le débouché du triq sultan, la route royale des Hauts Plateaux à la Méditerranée et même un débouché du commerce transsaharien. Les émirs kalbites de Sicile s'inspirent des palais de Béjaïa pour établir ceux de Palerme. La ville plus qu'une place reconnue ou appréciée est un endroit de passage obligé ; elle est un véritable carrefour sur la route de l'Al Andalus à l'Orient (notamment pour les pèlerins allant vers La Mecque) mais aussi de l'Europe vers l'Afrique. C'est un lieu de rencontres et d'échanges des savoirs entre les communautés locales, d'Europe et d'Orient.\nL'implantation des souverains hammadides va en faire la capitale du Maghreb Central et la madinat at tarikh (la ville d'histoire) algérienne. Fait politique original à l’échelle du Maghreb ancien, elle est une capitale littorale. Elle devient un des principaux centres culturels et scientifiques de la Méditerranée occidentale et une place commerciale importante pour l'Europe. Si l'état précis de la flotte marchande bougiotte est méconnu elle occupe une place non négligeable en Méditerranée sans toutefois être prépondérante face aux flottes de commerces européennes. Elle est fréquentée par des marchands latins, Pisans et Génois, Andalous et plus tard Catalans. Ces commerçants du midi de l'Europe lui donnent divers noms en langues romanes : Bugia, Buzia, Bugea, Buzana. C'est à cette époque que la cire de la ville, exportée vers l'Europe pour la confection de chandelles, donne le mot « bougie » au français et le mot « basane » pour désigner des peaux ; emprunt lexicaux des noms transcrits de la ville (respectivement de Bougie et Buzana). La ville exporte en effet cire d'abeille et peaux en quantité, des écorces tanniques pour le travail des cuirs (l'iscorzia di Bugiea est célèbre au XIVe siècle), de l'alun, des céréales, des raisins secs, de la laine et du coton de Biskra et M'sila, des métaux et de la poterie. La ville importe également diverses marchandises comme des métaux, du tissu, des teintures et des herbes médicinales. Elle est également une base navale pour les Hammadides, et le point de départ d'expéditions navales pour le « pays de Rum » (dont la Sicile à trois jours de navigation). La flotte hammadide joue un rôle important en Méditerranée occidentale ; elle freine les avancées européennes, notamment celles des Normands de Sicile au XIIe siècle.\n\nLes Hammadides attirent les lettrés de tous horizons et pratiquent une politique ouverte, sur l'Europe notamment. Les Juifs et les Chrétiens bénéficient de conditions favorables ; l'émir An Nasir entretient une correspondance régulière avec le pape Grégoire VII et lui fait la demande de nommer un évêque pour sa ville. L’arrivée de lettrés fait de Béjaïa une ville de premier plan dans le domaine des sciences ; son influence dépasse la Méditerranée et gagne l’Europe. Une culture andalouse se mêle à l'inspiration orientale traditionnelle, les sciences profanes se développent comme les sciences sacrées. Contrairement à la Qal'a dans l'arrière-pays, elle fait figure de ville culturelle et « moderne » pour son époque.\nUne « cité berbère vivant à l'orientale »,beaucoup de savants illustres en sont issus ou s'y établissent tout au long de sa période médiévale : Al Madani (Xe siècle), Ibn Hammad, Yahia Zwawi, Leonardo Fibonacci (XIIe siècle), Raymond Lulle et Ibn Khaldoun (XIIIe siècle).\nLes érudits viennent compléter leur formation dans la ville comme ils le font au Caire, à Tunis ou à Tlemcen. Des centaines d'étudiants, dont certains d'origine européenne, se pressent dans les écoles, les mosquées où enseignent théologiens, juristes, philosophes et savants. Les principaux lieux de savoirs médiévaux sont la Grande Mosquée, Madinat al-`Ilm (la Cité des Sciences), la Khizana Sultaniya et l’institut Sidi Touati. Le juriste Al Ghobrini (1246-1314), qadi de la ville, décrit les savants de Béjaïa comme « princes de la science », parmi lesquels Sidi Boumedienne, Abd al-Haq al-Isbili, al-Qurashi et Abu Tamim Ben Gebara. Ces savants se réunissent dans des audiences où il se consultent sur divers sujets. Il existe une rivalité et des échanges intellectuels entre Tlemcen, la Zénète et Béjaïa, la Sanhadja. Cette tolérance de la ville est nuancée par une des versions du récit de la mort de Raymond Lulle. En effet selon une version il aurait été lapidé par les Bougiotes qui l'avaient accusé de vouloir les convertir au christianisme quand d'autres versions affirment qu'il a simplement fait naufrage à son retour vers Majorque depuis Tunis.\nEn 1202, Leonardo Fibonacci, mathématicien italien, en rapporta les « chiffres arabes » et la notation algébrique. Selon les versions, l'inspiration de la suite de Fibonnacci serait due à l'observation des apiculteurs et la reproduction des abeilles de la région ou à un problème mathématique local concernant la reproduction des lapins qu'il décrit dans son ouvrage Liber abaci.\n\nÀ cette époque la ville a connu un tel développement que, selon Léon l'Africain, elle est peuplée de plusieurs dizaines de milliers de personnes originaires de tout le Maghreb, du Levant, d'Europe et d'Asie. La population autochtone de la ville est composée essentiellement de Berbères venus de l'arrière-pays kabyle et de la forte communauté de réfugiés andalous. L'estimation de la population à cette époque est estimée à 100 000 habitants par Al Idrissi.\nMohammad Ibn Toumert rencontre Abd al-Mumin, celui qui sera le calife de son mouvement et d'un nouvel État (les Almohades), à proximité de Béjaïa vers 1118. Mohammad Ibn Toumert a prêché le retour aux sources de l'Islam à partir de Mellala, localité située à 10 km de Béjaïa. Des années auparavant, le guide des Almohades aurait été chassé par les gens de Béjaïa auxquels il reprochait avec force leurs mœurs. Le mouvement politique qu'il a fondé est la base de l'Empire Almohade qui s'empare de Béjaïa en 1152 et dépose les Hammadides. La ville garde son importance stratégique sous les Almohades ; elle devient une capitale provinciale. Le calife Abd el Mumin nomme un membre de sa propre famille comme gouverneur de la ville, preuve de son importance stratégique. Le port de la cité abrite la flotte du calife et celle des Hammadides dont il s’est emparé. En 1183, durant une période brève, les Beni Ghania (des restes de la dynastie Almoravides) s'emparent de Béjaïa avant que les Almohades n'en reprennent le contrôle.\nAprès la dislocation de l'Empire Almohade, Béjaïa rentre dans l'orbite des Berbères hafsides de Tunis qui se rendent indépendants en juin 1228. Mais dans les faits, en raison du morcellement et des querelles de succession, l'émir ou sultan de Béjaïa se rend indépendant de celui de Tunis à la tête d'un véritable royaume dissident sur diverses périodes, dont la dernière avant la conquête espagnole s'étend sur tout le XVe siècle, on parle alors du « royaume de Bougie ». Le commerce reste actif avec les États chrétiens et la ville est un des principaux point d’accueil des réfugiés andalous fuyant la Reconquista.\n\nLa ville dotée d'une identité politique forte reste une ville importante sur le plan des sciences et du commerce. En effet, sa richesse et son emplacement de port stratégique en font un objet de convoitise pour les Zianides de Tlemcen. Ces derniers effectuent un grand siège de la ville en 1313. La ville est vue comme capitale des régions occidentales du sultanat hafside de Tunis et « place-frontière » du sultanat. Aux XIIIe siècle et XIVe siècle, elle devient à diverses occasions le siège du pouvoir d'émirs-gouverneurs indépendants, ou de dissidents de la dynastie hafside. Ces « souverains de Béjaïa » étendent leur autorité — qui va souvent de pair avec une dissidence politique — à l'ensemble du domaine de l'ancien royaume des Hammadides : Alger, Dellys, Miliana, Constantine, Annaba et les oasis du Zab. Ibn Khaldoun les décrit comme gouvernant « Biğāya wa al-ṯagr al-garbī min Ifriqiya » (la ville de Béjaïa et la marche occidentale de l’Ifrīqiya). Ibn Khaldoun sera d'ailleurs le chambellan (équivalent alors de Premier ministre) de l'administration indépendante d'un sultan hafside de Béjaïa, Abou Abdallah, en 1365.\nLe XVe siècle voit globalement un retour à la centralisation de l’État hafside. Mais à la fin du XVe siècle et au début du XVIe siècle, Léon l'Africain et Al-Marini décrivent un prince de Béjaïa, séparé de celui de Tunis, avec une situation similaire à Constantine et Annaba, ce qui traduit un morcellement du territoire hafside. Durant les dernières années du pouvoir hafside, face au déclin du commerce en Méditerranée, l'activité corsaire se développe, du fait notamment des Andalous qui connaissent les rivages et les flottes d'Espagne.\n\nLes siècles de décadence de Béjaïa\nA l'instar du sort tragique subi à la charnière du XVe siècle par moult caravansérails et plusieurs cités médiévales du Sahara et du littoral maghrébin, parfois radicalement, celles caractérisées par une économie significativement liée au commerce transsaharien-méditerranéen ainsi que par un manque de substituts de façon inhérente ou de facto (telles Mahdia en Tunisie, Honaïne en Algérie, radicalement Sijilmassa au Maroc, etc), Bejaia amorce ainsi son déclin dans ce cadre de concours de circonstances de reconfiguration du commerce mondial au profit des nouvelles routes maritimes dominées dans un premier temps par les Portugais et les Hollandais au détriment des précédentes routes caravanières et ce qui leur était connexe.\n\nUne cité convoitée\nLes Espagnols, sur la lancée de la Reconquista, effectuent des raids sur les ports d'Afrique du Nord. La ville est prise par l'Espagnol Pedro Navarro en 1510 au sultan Abdelaziz. Les Espagnols mettent fin au « royaume de Bougie » du Maghreb central. Ils font de la ville un de leurs comptoirs qui se maintient grâce aux relations avec Pise et Gênes. Mais leur rudesse provoque la fuite de la population locale, et des conflits avec les Berbères des alentours. La ville ne peut plus servir de relais d'échange avec l'arrière-pays et Abou Bakr, le frère de Abdelaziz et sultan tente de reprendre la ville en 1512 à partir de sa nouvelle capitale, Constantine (reprenant le dispositif de siège zianide du XIVe siècle).\nLes Espagnols se contentent de contrôler un périmètre formant une sorte de triangle compris entre Bordj Abdelkader, la Casbah et le Bordj Moussa. La ville comprise en dehors de ces limites n'est pas défendable par la faible garnison espagnole et est ruinée. L'esprit de l'inquisition influence la politique espagnole locale, les Juifs sont chassés de la ville et les élites citadines, dont les lettrés, fuient. La tradition savante se déplace alors massivement vers les zaouïas de l'arrière-pays kabyle, les manuscrits sont également déplacés et dispersés. La population de la ville est en chute libre, et même la garnison espagnole se réduit de plus en plus ; elle compte 500 hommes en 1555.\n\nLes anciennes possessions de Béjaïa sont morcelées, ce qui entrave la reconquête de la ville. En Kabylie, El Abbès le fils du sultan de Béjaïa fonde sa principauté autour de la Kalâa des Béni Abbès emmenant une partie des élites de la ville ; sur la rive ouest de la Soummam il est concurrencé par Belkadi, descendant du juriste bougiote Al Ghobrini qui fonde le sultanat de Koukou. À Constantine c'est Abou Bakr, frère de l'ancien sultan, qui se proclame sultan sur tout l'Est algérien. Ces divers protagonistes, rivaux entre eux, espèrent chacun reconquérir la ville et unifier ses anciennes dépendances.\nC'est à cette époque que dans un Maghreb où les anciens États sont en déliquescence qu'apparaissent les frères Barberousse, corsaires grecs convertis à l'islam qui s'implantent dans la ville voisine de Jijel. Ils se joignent aux différentes tentatives de reprendre la ville aux Espagnols grâce à leur savoir-faire en matière de navigation. Ils finissent par fonder leur propre État autour d'Alger, basé en partie sur l'activité corsaire, et étendent rapidement leur influence sur l'Algérie septentrionale en rentrant progressivement dans l'orbite ottomane et en se présentant aux yeux de la population comme concurrents directs des Espagnols. Béjaïa devient rapidement un objectif stratégique ; les Barberousse évincent progressivement les Hafsides de Constantine et Annaba. Charles Quint se sert de la ville comme un repli après la désastreuse expédition de 1541 contre Alger.\n\nUne cité marginalisée\nLes Barberousse n'atteindront jamais leur objectif de reprendre Béjaïa de leur vivant. C'est un de leurs successeurs, le beylerbey Salah Raïs qui finit par entrer dans la ville après la bataille de Béjaïa (1555) avec l'aide des Kabyles de Koukou. La ville est intégrée à l’État de la régence d'Alger et dépend du beylik de Constantine jusqu'en 1830. Le découpage territorial en trois beyliks place la ville dans une position marginale. Le rêve politique des Barberousse d'implanter leur capitale dans Béjaïa est abandonné ; la régence est déjà installée à Alger qui est un port fortifié et dans lequel de nombreux aménagements ont été effectués. La seule institution d'envergure maintenue sur cette période est celle du dar senâa, les chantiers navals ou arsenaux de la ville qui fournissent des navires à la régence.\nLa ville, dotée d'un caïd turc, est vue surtout comme une cité possiblement concurrente d'Alger et encerclée de montagnes hostiles. L'élévation d'une flotte corsaire est surveillée de près de peur de la voir concurrencer celle d'Alger ; la flotte d'Alger vient hiverner dans ses criques où elle est naturellement à l’abri. La ville voit donc son déclin s'accentuer après le départ des Espagnols. Les habitants entretiennent une petite flotte de commerce d'une vingtaine de chebeks ou felouques qui commercent quand la météo est favorable avec Alger, Oran, Bouna et Tunis pour y exporter les productions de la région. L'hiver, cette flotte est stationnée sur la plage de Dar senâa sous la Casbah pour n'être remise à flot qu'au printemps. Les marchandises exportées sont de l'huile, de la cire, des figues sèches, et des cuirs ; des tissus et de céréales sont importés. Ces navires peuvent transporter du bois pour la karasta : l'exploitation du bois pour la construction navale d'Alger. L'activité corsaire se poursuit durant cette période, notamment avec celle de Jijel. En 1671, la ville est visée par les Anglais conduits par Édouard Sprague qui la bombardent pour faire cesser les attaques corsaires contre leurs navires.\nDurant toute cette période, la ville n'est pas entretenue, et les descriptions de divers voyageurs traduisent la dégradation du bâti et le manque de réparation. Sidi M'hamed Amokrane, un marabout, fils du sultan des Aït Abbas, Sidi Naceur Amokrane (ou Mokrani), s'installe près de Béjaïa vers 1630, avant d'aller vers Jijel. Il déplace sa zaouïa du village d'Ama'dan vers la ville où les Turcs le chargent de diriger la karasta. À l'époque d'Al Warthilani (1713 – 1779), la ville semble être entre les mains de trois personnages importants : le cadi, le caïd et le descendant du marabout Mokrani.\nLes caïds demandent aux marabouts de passer sous laânaya (protection) des troupes de Béjaïa jusqu'à Alger. En effet, la ville située au cœur de la Kabylie, indépendante du pouvoir exécutif d'Alger, est souvent assiégée lors de conflits insurrectionnels entre les diverses confédérations de la région. Lors de la grande révolte de 1806, menée par le chérif Ben el Harche, la ville est assiégée sans succès. En 1823, les tribus des Bibans et de la Soummam s'emparent du caïd de la ville. En 1825, l'agha Yahia, commandant des troupes venues d'Alger, envahit la ville et lance des opérations de répression sur les tribus de la Soummam. Le chaouch Mohamed Ben Kanoun a joué un rôle clé lors de la révolte des tribus de Bougie en 1823. En tant que représentant de Yahia Agha, il a été chargé de négocier avec les chefs locaux pour faciliter le passage de soldats turcs destinés à Alger, alors sous blocus anglais. Sa mission a impliqué des rencontres avec des figures influentes de la région, notamment El-Hadj el-Mouloud, un marabout respecté des Béni Idjeùr, qui l'a aidé à obtenir le soutien des principales tribus de l'Oued Sahel. Grâce à ses efforts diplomatiques, il a réussi à obtenir des mules pour transporter les troupes, malgré les tensions locales et les défis logistiques.\nCette intervention souligne l'importance de Mohamed ben Kanoun en tant qu'intermédiaire efficace entre les autorités ottomanes et les tribus kabyles, contribuant ainsi à maintenir l'ordre et à faciliter les déplacements militaires essentiels pour la défense d'Alger.\n\nLa chute de la régence et la période coloniale\nEn 1830, les Français se lancent à la conquête de l'Algérie. Au début, l'expédition est dirigée contre Alger. Mais très tôt, les envahisseurs cherchent à occuper l'ensemble du pays, notamment la Kabylie contre laquelle sont dirigées plusieurs expéditions. Béjaïa, passée sous le contrôle de la tribu des Mezzaïa après la chute du dey d'Alger, subit plusieurs incidents impliquant des navires français et anglais. En 1831, deux expéditions visant à lui imposer comme caïd un dénommé Mourad, puis un certain Bou Setta, sont mises en échec. Une nouvelle expédition aboutit en 1833 à la prise de la ville, après une résistance acharnée de ses habitants. Cependant les Français ne parviennent pas à en conquérir les alentours.\n\nLa ville et sa région opposent une résistance farouche à la présence coloniale française ; d'ailleurs comme les Espagnols au XVIe siècle, les Français se contentent d'une occupation restreinte jusqu'en 1846. Divers ouvrages défensifs sont aménagés autour de la place, notamment sur les hauteurs\nLa ville prend part à plusieurs soulèvements et insurrections, comme celle du chérif Boubaghla, et surtout la grande révolte du Cheikh El Mokrani et du Cheikh Aheddad en 1871.\nLors de la conquête française, la ville n'était plus qu'une très modeste bourgade d'environ 2 000 habitants. La ville est érigée en commune de plein exercice par décret du 17 juin 1854. Les Français comblent partiellement la baie et aménagent le port et l'avant-port de la ville. Les travaux d'urbanisme (aménagement du front de mer et de grands axes) marquent son tissu urbain. Elle retrouve progressivement un rôle de débouché de la Kabylie, et de port d'export de produits agricoles locaux. Les habitants algériens maintiennent toujours leur activité de navigation marchande par cabotage le long des côtes. En 1906, le phare du cap Carbon est construit, c'est le plus haut au monde du fait de son emplacement naturel (altitude 220 mètres) et il a une portée de 33 miles.\nLe 8 mai 1945, la répression conduite par les forces coloniales françaises à Kherrata, où la marine de guerre est mise à contribution pour un bombardement naval des côtes de la région de Béjaïa, fait des milliers de victimes.\nPendant la guerre d'indépendance algérienne, l'organisation du FLN et de l'ALN crée pour la première fois un territoire administratif kabyle, la wilaya III ; Béjaïa fait partie de cet ensemble. Le congrès de la Soummam qui est la réunion politique du FLN qui fixe la ligne politico-militaire du mouvement national algérien dans la guerre a lieu à Ouzellaguen, dans l'arrière-pays bougiote.\n\nL'agglomération moderne\nÀ la veille de la guerre d'Algérie en 1954 elle comporte 30 000 habitants dont 6 200 Européens. Une des dernières décisions de l'administration coloniale est de constriure un oléoduc, depuis Hassi Messaoud, avec la ville comme dépôt terminal et port pétrolier. En 1959 Béjaïa est le port pétrolier le plus important de l'Algérie, ce qui est source de revenus. En 1962, elle est intégrée dans la wilaya de Sétif, avant de devenir le siège de sa propre wilaya en 1974. La ville connaît un essor démographique, et une urbanisation de la plaine du Lekhmis, à la suite de l'afflux de ruraux, notamment de Kabylie.\nBéjaïa, comme d'autres villes de la Soummam, est un des foyers de la revendication identitaire berbère lors du printemps berbère de 1980 ; et en 2001, lors du printemps noir. Si elle peine à s'imposer comme capitale économique de la Petite Kabylie, elle est indéniablement la capitale culturelle de la Kabylie, en concurrence avec Tizi-Ouzou. L'ouverture du champ politique a permis l’émergence de groupements, associations, manifestations artistiques et culturelles de tous types. Le Centre Universitaire, par sa présence, soutient le mouvement et il est programmé d'installer à Béjaïa l'institut de langue tamazight.\nCette expansion rapide de la ville est également un défi sur le plan de l'urbanisme ; la ville a en effet du mal à s'assurer un hinterland du fait du relief. D'autre part le patrimoine et la culture sont également un enjeu car menacés à long terme. Le site exceptionnel pose aussi la question environnementale et celle des pollutions liées aux activités domestiques et industrielles. Au début des années 1990, l'augmentation de la population combinée à l'absence de planification et l’insuffisance des politiques publiques dégrade le cadre de vie de la ville, malgré des atouts certains pour son avenir.\n\nArchitecture et urbanisme\nPaysage urbain\nCentre-ville\nLe centre-ville de Béjaïa est composé du quartier colonial et de la vieille ville, la médina, elle-même largement remaniée par les tracés urbains du temps de l’Empire espagnol, puis de l’Algérie française. La vieille ville est adossée au massif du Gouraya ; elle fut marquée par la présence espagnole durant laquelle elle perdit des nombreux édifices médiévaux (comme le palais de l'Étoile hammadide), puis par les aménagements français. Ce secteur ne manque cependant pas d'édifices ou de vestiges, antiques (notamment sur le plan archéologique) ou médiévaux ; les quartiers d'Acherchour, de Karamane et Bab El Louz possèdent encore des maisons mauresques. Mais faute d'entretien, de prise de conscience publique et de classement, l'introduction de matériaux non authentiques (béton, brique...) menace ce patrimoine. Les structures défensives de la ville sont encore présentes dans le secteur de la vieille ville à divers endroits (Bab el Bounoud, muraille hammadide près du port, Casbah...). La partie coloniale de la ville s'illustre notamment par le quartier du front de mer, amputant une partie de la vieille ville, et du port. Inspiré de l'architecture haussmannienne, il comporte également la célèbre place du 1er novembre, encore désignée comme place Geydon.\n\nQuartiers périphériques\nAu lendemain de l'indépendance, les développements se font dans la continuité des plans d'urbanisation coloniale et ils conservent les mêmes axes. L'extension de Béjaïa, à l'ouest et au sud, est marquée par la construction de nouveaux lotissements à Ighil Ouazoug et de cités étatiques à Sidi Ahmed, du quartier de la Plaine, du boulevard Krim Belkacem et du boulevard des Aurès. Parallèlement à la construction de cités étatiques, des constructions privées gagnent, de manière anarchique, du terrain sur la plaine. L'urbanisation de la zone d'Ihadaden est la plus récente. Sur le territoire de la commune, en périphérie de la ville se trouvent des espaces naturels, comme le parc du Gouraya, ou agricoles, telles que la plaine et la vallée de la Soummam, qui participent de l'originalité du cadre de la ville.\nOutre la ville de Béjaïa, la commune administrative de Béjaïa (dont le cadre est plus large que la ville car il comprend même une bonne partie du parc du Gouraya) est composée des localités suivantes : Dar Naceur, P.K. 17, Boukhiama, Ihaddaden, Targa Ouzemour, Ighil Ouazzoug, Bir Slam, Iriyahen Est, Aérodrome, Boulimat, Oued Saket et Amtik Tafat. Ces localités sont plus ou moins éloignées de la ville.\n\nGestion du patrimoine\nEn raison de son histoire très ancienne, Béjaïa est une ville qui possède un patrimoine riche. Il s'étend bien au-delà de la ville : les ruines de Tiklat et de l'aqueduc de Tikdja, la citadelle zianide à El Kseur et le patrimoine savant déplacé lors des périodes de crise comme l'invasion espagnole de 1510, sont autant d'éléments patrimoniaux de l'arrière-pays en rapport direct avec l'histoire de la ville.\nUn projet d'étude de réhabilitation et de classement de la médina de Béjaïa mené par l'UNESCO, et impliquant les acteurs locaux est en cours depuis 2003. L’État algérien a par ailleurs déjà inscrit des sites de la ville sur la liste du patrimoine national : les restes de l'enceinte fortifiée de Bab Fouka (porte Fouka), le Bordj Moussa, la Casbah de Béjaïa, Bab el bhar (porte de la mer), la citerne romaine et le cippe romain (pierre funéraire incrustée à une fontaine de la ville).\n\nBien que la ville ne bénéficie pas d'une reconnaissance mondiale pour son statut historique, son territoire dispose d'un patrimoine original, fruit des influences accumulées sur 2 000 ans d'histoire. L'implantation de constructions humaines très anciennes dans un site naturel exceptionnel confère toute sa complexité au tissu urbain de la ville. Cette offre patrimoniale diversifiée et non valorisée, pourrait être moteur d'emplois et de revenus en mettant en avant son potentiel culturel et touristique. Cependant le diagnostic de ce patrimoine fait état de dégradations importantes, malgré sa valeur et son rôle potentiel dans le développement durable de la ville. Cette situation est le résultat d'une prise en charge menée uniquement par des acteurs officiels aux compétences mal délimitées.\n\nMédina\nLe secteur historique de Béjaïa n'est toujours pas défini comme secteur sauvegardé du fait de l'imbrication d'une typologie coloniale dans le tissu de la médina. Les interventions de protection se limitent aux seuls monuments classés au patrimoine national, traduisant des lacunes dans l'approche de la sauvegarde du patrimoine de la ville.\nLa ville de Béjaïa et sa wilaya ne comptent que 17 sites classés ; ce qui est insignifiant au regard de l’immensité du patrimoine de la ville. Les éléments classés ne représentent que les périodes antique (classements coloniaux) et hammadide (classements post-coloniaux). Il y a absence de classement des édifices anciens et importants ayant subi des transformations et des réhabilitations à l’époque coloniale : l'institut Sidi Touati, d’époque hammadide (XIIe siècle) transformé en caserne, le mausolée d’Abou Zakaria, d’époque hafside (XIIIe siècle), transformé en direction de la pêche sur la baie de Sidi Yahia, le fort Abdelkader, la mosquée et la place Sidi Soufi réaménagés à l’époque coloniale.\n\nLes édifices cultuels judaïques du quartier Karamane, antérieurs à la colonisation, ne sont pas inventoriés ainsi que les découvertes archéologiques plus récentes. La priorité donnée au classement d'éléments monumentaux est en contradiction avec les principes des conventions internationales orientées vers la classification d'ensembles urbains (et la définition d’un périmètre à sauvegarder) en incluant les productions mineures. La patrimonialisation sélective d'éléments précis et triés a pour conséquence une mise à l'écart de pans entiers du patrimoine local.\nOutre les raisons politiques, l'absence de définition d'un secteur sauvegardé serait due à la superposition de différents styles ; les influences espagnoles et coloniales ayant largement remanié la médina. La loi algérienne prévoit d'inclure des ensembles patrimoniaux homogènes tels que les casbah, les ksours et les agglomérations traditionnelles. Dans le cas de Béjaïa, définir un périmètre impliquerait d'inclure des pans de quartier à la typologie coloniale ou bien, de définir un noyau très restreint. Le patrimoine de la ville est ainsi menacé par la paupérisation, la dévitalisation du noyau historique, l'effondrement des habitations et la perte des significations patrimoniales consécutives au départ de la population ancrée dans le tissu de la vieille ville\n\nLes structures défensives\nLa ville comporte encore des pans entiers de la muraille berbère médiévale, bâtie sous la dynastie hammadide (XIe siècle) dont il subsiste d'anciennes portes : Bab el Bounoud et Bab el Bhar. Le principal ouvrage défensif de la ville, la Casbah, est à l'origine d'époque almohade. Le fort Abdelkader, face à la mer, est aussi un legs de la période berbère médiévale. La période espagnole (1510-1555) et les conflits avec les Berbères aux environs sont à l’origine de la destruction de nombreux édifices (palais, mosquées...) qui faisaient la gloire de la cité médiévale. La structuration de la ville à des fins défensives par les Espagnols redessine la morphologie de la ville à partir du XVIe siècle : la Casbah est aménagée, le bordj Moussa est construit à proximité des ruines de l'ancien palais de l'étoile , et, sur la montagne du Gouraya, est aménagé un fort (bordj Gouraya), sur un ancien point d'observation à proximité d'un lieu de pèlerinage maraboutique consacré à Yemma Gouraya, une sainte locale. Ce dernier ouvrage permet, en tirant parti du relief, de dominer l'ensemble de la ville et la mer, et sera remanié au XIXe siècle par les Français.\n\nÉdifices religieux\nBéjaïa et ses alentours\nL'arrière-pays possède une organisation et un patrimoine en lien avec la ville de Béjaïa et son histoire. De nombreuses stèles aux écritures berbères libyques ou néo-puniques datant de la période numide et de la diffusion des influences puniques sont retrouvées dans la région. Ainsi dans la vallée de la Soummam, on retrouve les traces de la présence punique ou romaine qui ont marqué la ville (connue dans l'antiquité sous le nom de Saldae) ; c'est le cas des ruines de la cité de Tiklat (Tubusuptu).\nL'histoire médiévale de Béjaïa a également marqué les environs et la toponymie. Le triq sultan, la route royale, d'époque hammadide relie les Hauts-Plateaux, plus précisément leur première capitale : la Kalâa des Beni Hammad à Béjaïa. Les différentes luttes dynastiques pour s'emparer de la ville, considérée comme stratégique, ont laissé dans la région divers ouvrages fortifiés. C'est le cas de la citadelle zianide à El Kseur qui, bâtie par les assaillants, servait de place forte en vue de la conquête de Béjaïa alors aux mains des Hafsides.\nL'exode des lettrés bougiotes au XVIe siècle, fuyant les Espagnols, déplace une partie de la riche tradition savante médiévale de Béjaïa vers les zaouïas ou timaamart de la région durant les « siècles obscurs » de la ville. Les plus illustres étant celles de Chellata, des Aït Yala et notamment de Cheikh el Mouhoub. Une partie des manuscrits de la ville, ou leur contenu recopié, ont été transmis par ce biais et ont permis aux historiens du XIXe siècle de se pencher sur l'histoire de la ville. Ces manuscrits abordent divers sciences pratiquées localement, notamment l'astronomie, traditionnellement pratiquée jusqu'au début du XXe siècle ; ils portent aussi sur la théologie musulmane dont Béjaïa fut un des centres d'étude de premier plan au cours de son histoire.\n\nLes défis de la ville\nLa ville de Béjaïa est confrontée à de multiples défis urbains et environnementaux. C'est une ville en forte croissance démographique, dotée d'une interface portuaire et d'un secteur industriel dynamique ; mais l’insuffisance des politiques publiques urbaines font peser divers menaces sur la ville.\nLa ville a connu depuis la fin de période coloniale une urbanisation en « secteurs fonctionnels » qui n'a pas donné de résultat efficaces. La mise en place, au cours des années 1970, de vastes zones industrielles hétérogènes (pétrochimie, manufacture, agro-alimentaire...), à l'est de la ville (côté vallée de la Soummam), a dépossédé l'urbanisation de la ville de toute logique. La proximité de ces zones n'améliore pas leur efficacité et elles empiètent sur une partie stratégique de la ville, en plus d'être source de pollution importante pour le fleuve, l'estuaire et la baie.\nL'expansion démographique se fait aux dépens des plaines fertiles du côté de la vallée de la Soummam et concerne très peu les contreforts montagneux du Gouraya ; il s'ensuit une bétonisation des surfaces cultivables et une altération de l’environnement immédiat de la ville. Le tournant des années 1970 voit ainsi la ville quitter la montagne pour envahir ces plaines qui servaient d'arrière-pays agricole. L'expansion de la ville se fait de manière anarchique, avec un manque de planification et donc de services publics dans les nouveaux quartiers périphériques. Il y a également une saturation des axes routiers de la ville ou de sa périphérie, car aucune politique de transport d'envergure n'a été mise en œuvre. L’autoroute devant desservir la ville est encore en travaux et les dessertes ferroviaires inefficaces contribuant à l'inconfort des habitants dans leurs déplacements.\nCes éléments, qui pèsent sur l'environnement, se combinent à un afflux de touristes venant des villes algériennes intérieures sur le littoral en période estivale. Il n'y a pas de politique cohérente de gestion des déchets au niveau de la ville et des plages. La vallée de la Soummam est également bordée en amont par des zones industrielles comme celles d'Akbou qui déversent des polluants chimiques dans le fleuve sans aucun contrôle public rigoureux. Il existe d'ailleurs épisodiquement un phénomène de poissons morts sur le fleuve, dont on ne sait s'il est lié à une réduction du débit du fleuve, induisant une moindre oxygénation de ses eaux, ou à la pollution. Le site de la ville de Béjaïa apparaît donc comme fragilisé par les aménagements, les activités humaines et surtout le manque de planification et les insuffisances de l'État et des collectivités (wilayas et communes). La question d'un développement durable incluant la préservation du patrimoine, du site naturel et impliquant les habitants reste entière ; même si au niveau associatif ou universitaire une prise de conscience a déjà eu lieu, les actions ont une portée encore trop limitée pour améliorer durablement la situation.\n\nReligion\nMosquées\nMosquée Sidi Soufi\nMosquée Iheddadèn\nMosquée Al-Kaouthar\nMosquée Iben Badiss (ancienne Eglise Sainte-Thérèse)\nMosquée Sidi-ElMouhoub (ancienne Eglise Saint-Joseph)\nMosquée Abou Soufiane ( Baba Fessiane dans le parler local)\nMosquée Sidi-ElKhider\n\nZaouïas\nZaouïa de Béjaïa\n\nCimetières\nCimetière de Béjaïa\nCimetière Sidi M'Hamed Amokrane\nCimetière Sidi Ahmed\n\nDémographie\nLa ville de Béjaïa connait un début d'accroissement démographique dès la période coloniale, mais avec un bilan contrasté. En effet, dès la fin du XIXe siècle, elle reprend son rôle de débouché naturel de la Kabylie, notamment de port d'exportation pour les produits agricoles. La ville développe alors une activité économique qui fait affluer une population nouvelle, un phénomène amplifié par des travaux d'urbanisme de grande ampleur. Cependant, il faut attendre la fin de la période coloniale pour que se maintienne une tendance durable à l'augmentation de la population citadine permanente, après le départ des populations de pieds-noirs et juives de la ville. La courbe démographique, irrégulière durant la période coloniale, commence à se stabiliser après l'indépendance pour suivre une courbe ascendante nette sous les effets conjugués d'un accroissement naturel et surtout du flux d'habitants provoqué par un exode rural massif. Le seuil des 100 000 habitants est franchi dans les années 1970. Il s'accompagne d'une urbanisation extensive et de plus en plus anarchique des environs, comme la plaine du Lekhmis. Sur 40 ans, s'étalant des années 1950 aux années 1990, la population et la surface de la ville ont été multipliées par 4. L'afflux des ruraux accentue le caractère berbère, et berbérophone de la ville en marginalisant numériquement la vieille population citadine au dialecte arabisé.\nSur la période 1998-2008, le taux d'accroissement de la population est de 1,7, et le recensement de 2008 dénombre 177 988 habitants selon l'Office national des statistiques. Le taux de scolarisation global est de 94,9 % (sur les six à quatorze ans). Le taux d'instruction dans l'enseignement supérieur est de 11,2 % (des plus de six ans). L'analphabétisme touche 18,5 % des plus de dix ans.\n\nAdministration et politique\nInstitutions municipales et locales\nLa commune de Béjaïa compte un conseil municipal (Assemblée populaire communale) composé de 33 élus choisis au suffrage universel. Ils sont chargés d'élire le président de l'APC (ou maire). L’exécutif communal est composé de six vice-présidents et de onze délégués, et l'exécutif de l'assemblée d'un président et six adjoints. Lors des élections de 2012, la répartition des sièges est la suivante: le FLN (quatorze sièges), le FFS (onze sièges), le RND (quatre sièges) et le PT (quatre sièges) ; le maire Hamid Merouani est alors issu de la majorité FLN-RND.\nLe 2 février 2020, le wali suspend son successeur, Hocine Merzougui (FFS), poursuivi dans le cadre d’enquêtes judiciaires sur la gestion des deniers publics. Abdenour Tafoukt devient maire de la commune.\nHocine Merzougui est condamné à trois ans de prison le 23 mars 2021 pour « abus de pouvoir volontaire à l’effet d’accorder d’indus privilèges en violation des lois et réglementations » et « octroi d’avantages indus lors de la passation de marchés publics ».\nLa ville est également le siège de l'Assemblée populaire de wilaya (APW) de la wilaya de Béjaïa, ainsi que de la daïra (qui gère les communes de Béjaïa et d'Oued Ghir).\n\nBudget\nLe Budget primitif est de l'ordre de 3 251 253 599,27 DA (dinars algériens) pour l'année 2016 ; équilibré en recettes et en dépenses. Les recettes sont constituées du produit de la fiscalité à hauteur de 30 250 448 460 DA, d'une subvention d'État à hauteur de 142 001 200,00 DA et de produits issus du patrimoine à hauteur de 84 207 553,27 DA. Les dépenses sont ventilées dans un pôle budget de fonctionnement de 2 196 111 624,93 DA qui lui-même se subdivise en crédit alloués à la masse salariale (1 091 320 458,55 DA) et en crédits consacrés aux fournitures et prestations (1 104 791 166,38 DA). L'autre pôle concerne les prélèvements pour les dépenses d'équipement et investissements qui s'élèvent à (1 055 141 974,34 DA).\nLes recettes sont le produit, par ordre d'importance, de la taxe sur l'activité professionnelle, sur la valeur ajoutée, l’impôt forfaitaire unique, et les taxes sur le foncier et l'assainissement. Elles proviennent également de diverses redevances administratives ou locatives et de dotations publiques (wilaya ou État). Les dépenses concernent l'aménagement et la voirie, les bâtiments et équipements administratifs, le fonctionnement des institutions scolaires, sportives et culturelles, les équipements sanitaires et sociaux, l'urbanisme et l'habitat, les équipements industriels, artisanaux et touristiques et les services industriels et commerciaux.\n\nProtocole d'amitié et jumelage\nBéjaïa est jumelée avec :\n\n Brest (France) depuis 1995.\nBéjaïa a un projet de jumelage avec :\n\n Portimão, (Portugal) depuis 2010.\n\nÉconomie\nSituation générale\nLa ville est un nœud important pour la Kabylie ; elle sert d'interface entre la mer et la région, et au-delà, pour les Hauts Plateaux. La ville est un carrefour industriel local ; les zones industrielles d'Akbou, de Sétif, et de la ville elle-même trouvent leur débouché par son port.\nCependant la géographie montagneuse de la région et le manque d'infrastructure de qualité sont les principaux freins à l'économie. Par exemple, la ville n'est desservie que par des routes nationales, l’autoroute est en cours de réalisation et doit être progressivement livrée par tronçon à partir de la fin de l'année 2017. Elle bénéficie cependant depuis les années 1960 de l'arrivée d'un oléoduc qui achemine les hydrocarbures sahariens. La ville a quand même réussi à se hisser à un rang important dans l'économie nationale, y compris dans les secteurs autres que pétroliers. L’État algérien a investi au cours des années 1970 dans le pôle industriel de la ville avec des unités de production dynamiques. Cependant plusieurs faiblesses comme le manque d'investissements extérieurs, le manque de circuits pour favoriser l'exportation des productions locales (hors hydrocarbures) et l'absence d'un urbanisme cohérent entravent la croissance économique de la ville. Cet ensemble de facteurs mine le développement de la ville et son potentiel. Le taux de chômage officiel à l'échelle de la wilaya est de 12 % en 2012. Le taux d'activité est de 46,9 % à l'échelle de la commune vers la fin des années 1990 parmi les plus de quinze ans.\n\nSecteurs économiques\nLa ville de Béjaïa possède un port de commerce international dont la principale activité, en termes de capitaux, est l'exportation d'hydrocarbures. Cependant la ville de Béjaïa sert de marché local notamment aux produit locaux de l'artisanat, et aux produits agricoles qui sont parfois exportés. Ainsi le port de Béjaïa est le second plus important du pays en termes de volume d'activité derrière celui d'Alger. Les ports de Béjaïa et de Djendjen (Jijel) ont été retenus par les autorités algériennes pour participer à la nouvelle initiative de l’Union européenne portant création des Autoroutes de la mer (AdM) dont le but est d'augmenter les échanges intermodaux entre les ports des rives nord et sud de la Méditerranée, comme c'est le cas notamment pour les ports de Marseille, Agadir, Gabès et de Haïfa.\nLa ville de Béjaïa bénéficie également d'une activité de port de pêche, c'est un des secteurs qui est amené à se développer dans le futur. Il faut donc remarquer que malgré le peu d'atouts naturels et l'enclavement de la ville, Béjaïa figure parmi les villes les plus dynamiques d'Algérie. Cependant les infrastructures restent insuffisantes et le développement de la ville en est tributaire.\nLa ville de Béjaia tire aussi profit de la production agricole de la région de Kabylie en ayant un rôle de marché local, voire d'exportatrice de denrées alimentaires, avec l'oléiculture, la production de figues, de sucre et l'apiculture ; le port possède même un couloir d'exportation pour les dattes sahariennes. Au niveau national, c'est aussi le siège d'entreprises agroalimentaires exportatrices comme Ifri et de groupes industriels comme Cevital.\nConcernant l'artisanat, la ville tire surtout profit de la production locale de vannerie et de poterie. La ville de Béjaïa essaye aussi d'exploiter son littoral méditerranéen et son patrimoine historique pour développer une activité touristique, cependant la majorité des touristes sont des Algériens ou des immigrés originaires de la région.\n\nCulture\nMonuments remarquables\nAncien bâtiment de la Banque de l'Algérie.\n\nMusique\nLa ville possède un patrimoine musical riche, mêlant influences berbères et andalouses. Une partie de la culture bougiote est portée par un vieux dialecte citadin : l'arabe bougiote, d'origine médiévale. Le style de musique classique le çanâa est à l'origine indissociable de la culture religieuse de la ville. Les instruments traditionnellement utilisés sont le bendir, le tar, la mandoline et l'alto, complétés ultérieurement par le mandole et le banjo. La spécificité de la chanson andalouse et chaabi bougiote est clairement perceptible, notamment par une prédilection pour l'usage de la kouitra et un enracinement dans un registre assez classique.\nLa musique est en effet traditionnellement le domaine des lettrés, des cadis et cheikh de confréries, dans lesquelles l'initiation à cet art se faisait le plus souvent. Le tout est enrichi du patrimoine des musiques locales, notamment kabyle berbérophone. Cette culture musicale et sa transmission seraient un héritage de la tradition savante médiévale de la ville et de l'afflux d'Andalous et de Morisques durant cette période. La ville est d'ailleurs un des centres (comme Alger, Constantine, Tlemcen...) de la musique andalouse en Algérie. Un illustre musicien de la ville : Cheikh Sadek El Béjaoui, remet ce style au goût du jour au XXe siècle, en entretenant un cercle musical puis en ouvrant une école qui formera divers musiciens reconnus dans des répertoires variés (traditionnels ou plus modernes).\nUn autre aspect de la musique bougiote est un courant plus populaire, mêlant le chaâbi et la musique kabyle. Le chant kabyle puise son inspiration dans l'identité berbère de la ville, sa tradition poétique, et dans l'afflux d'une population originaire de l'arrière-pays. L'identité musicale de la ville est ainsi imbriquée : les musiciens sont formés aux chants kabyles lors de leur apprentissage du style andalou à Béjaïa et les musiciens kabyles s'appuient sur les instruments de la musique andalouse. La ville connaît, notamment depuis les années 1970, une ouverture aux sonorités du monde, particulièrement occidentales, qui favorise un renouveau de la musique d'expression kabyle.\n\nMusées et manifestations culturelles\nLa ville de Béjaïa possède le musée du Borj Moussa, aménagé dans un ancien fort espagnol du XVIe siècle et où sont présentés des vestiges préhistoriques romains et de l'époque hafside. Le musée abrite également une collection d'oiseaux et d'insectes de toute l'Afrique ainsi que des tableaux de Maurice Boitel, prêtés par le musée d'Alger.\nDepuis 2010, la ville voisine de Toudja abrite un musée de l'eau consacré aux techniques d'acheminement de l'eau, notamment à l'époque romaine. Les environs comportent encore les ruines de l'aqueduc permettant d'acheminer l'eau depuis Toudja à la ville durant l'Antiquité. Le site contient des mosaïques, des thermes et des citernes d'époque romaine.\n\nArts et festivités\nBéjaïa accueille un festival international de théâtre, qui pour son édition 2016 a accueilli 17 pays. Outre les représentations en salle, il comporte divers ateliers populaires répartis de Béjaïa à Jijel.\nLa maison de la culture de la ville organise divers événements culturels. C'est le cas des célébrations de Yennayer (12 janvier), le nouvel an berbère, à l'occasion duquel un programme varié est mis en place. En effet la musique, la poésie et l'artisanat berbères sont particulièrement mis en valeur, à côté de thématiques environnementales et architecturales. Des délégations du Maroc et de la Tunisie sont également présentes, ainsi qu'une « caravane berbère » qui fait son entrée dans la ville le 12 janvier et comprend des participants venus de toute l'Algérie : des Touaregs d'Illizi, des participants de Ghardaïa, de Bouira, Tizi-Ouzou. Les festivités se terminent par un jeu de baroud le jour suivant. Le milieu associatif local est aussi le vecteur de divers champs artistiques ou culturels, allant d'associations faisant la promotion de la peinture ou de la photographie aux groupes d'études universitaires sur les manuscrits scientifiques médiévaux de la ville.\n\nCinéma\nL'association Project'heurts, née en 2001, est à l'origine de la création en 2002 d'un Ciné-club devenu aujourd'hui hebdomadaire, puis en 2003 des Rencontres Cinématographiques de Béjaïa (les RCB), festival annuel consacré au cinéma aussi bien maghrébin qu'international, longs et courts métrages, fictions et documentaires confondus, et qui se tient à la Cinémathèque de Béjaïa située sur la place Gueydon (place 1er novembre 1954). Le projet du festival : « réconcilier le public algérien avec le cinéma, sensibiliser au développement d’un esprit critique face à l’image (éducation à l’image), proposer des formations (écriture de scénario, réalisation, animation de ciné-clubs…) »\nEn septembre 2019, sous la direction artistique de Laila Aoudj, le festival s'associe aux Journées du film européen et accueille des films italien et ukrainien en présence des ambassadeurs de ces deux pays, ainsi qu'une importante « Master Class » consacrée au cinéaste Jean-Marie Straub par l'essayiste et critique de cinéma Saad Chakali.\n\nMédias\nComme toutes les villes d'Algérie, Béjaïa est desservie par le bouquet terrestre national ENTV, comprenant entre autres la Chaîne 4 en langue tamazight. La ville est le siège d'une station spécifique à sa région : Radio Béjaïa, chaine de radio publique, généraliste et en langue tamazight (kabyle).\n\nSituation linguistique\nLa ville est située en Kabylie, dans une région berbérophone. Elle possède, en partie, et depuis le Moyen Âge, un dialecte arabe spécifique : l'arabe bougiote, qui est pratiqué notamment dans la haute ville.\nCet arabe bougiote, appelé tabğawit en kabyle, est pratiqué dans les quartiers les plus anciens de la haute ville (Karamane, Bab el Louz...) et attribué aux « grandes familles » de la ville. Il y a une opposition entre la Plaine (Lexmis), dont son quartier le plus ancien, Lhouma-ou-Bazine, peuplé de ruraux berbérophones, et les quartiers de la haute ville. La ville s'étant agrandie jusqu'à inclure le village des Imezzayen. Ce noyau urbain berbérophone, reconnu comme authentiquement citadin même par les arabophones, a donné les bases d'un dialecte kabyle spécifique à la ville.\nLa persistance de l'arabe bougiote dans une ville berbère s'explique par le fait que historiquement la langue tamazight s’accommode mal avec le cadre urbain. Les montagnards berbérophones arrivant en ville furent surnommés les mouhouches ou imouhouchen (provenant de la forme tronquée Muḥ, du prénom typiquement kabyle Muḥand) et s'adaptèrent au parler local une fois arrivés dans la haute ville. Cependant l'exode rural massif des berbérophones (et leur arrivée en ville) après l'indépendance du pays, provoque une nette progression du berbère qui s'accompagne d'une progression sur le plan administratif. Le printemps berbère de 1980 voit la ville revendiquer son identité berbère. Ainsi, en 1991, le berbère est officiellement enseigné à l'université de Bejaïa et par la suite à l'école. Il s'ensuit une valorisation du fait berbère et une dépréciation de l'arabe bougiote. L'arabe bougiote, menacé, se maintient dans les quartiers de la haute ville désormais largement berbérisés. Pour les berbérophones il n'est d'ailleurs qu'une variante arabisée du kabyle.\n\nEnseignement\nBéjaïa est un pôle universitaire important ; la ville est dotée d'une université baptisée du nom d'Abderrahmane Mira, un martyr de la guerre d'Algérie. L'université accueille 45 700 étudiants et 1 714 enseignants. Elle compte actuellement plusieurs facultés : technologie, lettres, sciences humaines et sport, droit, sciences économiques, sciences de gestion et sciences commerciales, médecine, sciences exactes et sciences de la nature et de la vie.\nLa ville abrite également l'école technique de formation et d’instruction maritimes de Bejaia (EFTIM), sous l'égide du ministère des Transports, qui succède en 1989 à l'école de formation technique de pêcheurs (EFTP), elle-même héritière, en 1970, de l’école des mousses qui est l'instituion historique qui formait les marins à Béjaïa. D'autres écoles, comme l'école des sciences de gestion et d'informatique (ESGI), complètent l'offre de formation dans le supérieur. La ville possède aussi des lycées, comme le lycée Sidi Ahmed Stambouli.\n\nArtisanat\nLa ville de Béjaïa possède un artisanat qui est l'expression de la culture citadine de la ville, comportant des legs andalous, et des influences berbères qui se confondent avec celles de l'arrière-pays. La ville sert d'ailleurs de débouché à l'artisanat de Kabylie (poterie, vannerie, produits dérivés de l'agriculture locale...). Elle est par ailleurs dotée d'une Chambre de L'artisanat et des métiers qui gère ce secteur au niveau des wilayas de Béjaïa et Bouira.\nHistoriquement, la ville donne son nom aux chandelles qu'elle fabrique à base de cire d'abeille, les bougies, alors que les bougies modernes sont souvent faites à partir de paraffine. Ce savoir-faire se perd au cours du temps, même si une poignée d'artisans et de familles le maintiennent. La bougie en cire d'abeille n'a jamais connu historiquement un usage populaire répandu. En effet, onéreuse, elle était le privilège des seigneurs ou de l’exportation et fut localement concurrencée par les lampes à huile en argile.\n\nLa ville aux 99 Saints\nLa ville bénéficie d'une histoire religieuse riche, et de nombreux mausolées et zaouïas sont présents dans la ville et l'arrière-pays. Elle est ainsi connue comme « la ville aux 99 saints » ; selon les traditions orales, les Kabyles affirment qu'il ne lui en manque qu'un pour égaler la Mecque. La ville est d'ailleurs surnommée la « Petite Mecque » dès le Moyen Âge par Ibn Arabi et tel que rapporté par Ibn Khaldoun (El Mekka Es-Saghira). La sainte patronne de la ville est Yemma (qui signifie « maman ») Gouraya dont le mausolée se trouve à l'intérieur de l'enceinte du Fort du même nom.\n\nLa ville fut le lieu d'un grand pèlerinage au mois de Ramadan qui attira des populations du Maghreb. On officia une grande prière le 27e jour de ce mois, qui resta très populaire avant de tomber en désuétude au XXe siècle. Le statut de sainteté de la ville s'est d'ailleurs effacé progressivement au cours des siècles, même si les visites des mausolées de marabouts entretiennent toujours cette tradition.\n\nPersonnalités notables\nDalia Djebbar (1996-), joueuse de volley-ball.\nAbdeslam Mebarakou (1980-), footballeur algérien.\nWassyla Tamzali (1941-), avocate, directrice du programme sur la condition des femmes de l'UNESCO, y est née.\nDjamel Maafa (1968-), journaliste.\nMerzoug Touati, journaliste et blogueur, habite à Béjaïa.\n\nNotes et références\nNotes\nRéférences\nAnnexes\nBibliographie\n: document utilisé comme source pour la rédaction de cet article.\n\nOuvrages\nMouloud Gaïd, Histoire de Béjaïa et de sa région : depuis l'antiquité jusqu'à 1954, Alger, Éditions Mimouni, 1991, 2e éd. \nZahir Ihaddaden, Béjaïa à l'époque de sa splendeur (1060-1555), Alger, Éditions Dahlab, 2011 (ISBN 978-9961-6-1256-9)\nCharles-André Julien, Histoire de l'Afrique du Nord : des origines à 1830, Paris, Payot, 1966 (1re éd. 1951)\nM.

          "summary": "Béjaïa (en kabyle ⴱⴳⴰⵢⵜ, Bgayet ; en arabe بجاية, Biǧāya, /bid͡ʒaːja/), également appelée anciennement Bougie en français, est une commune algérienne située en bordure de la mer Méditerranée, à 220 km à l'est d'Alger. Elle est le chef-lieu de la wilaya de Béjaïa et de la daïra de Béjaïa, en Kabylie.\nLe site de la ville est peuplé depuis le paléolithique. Les vestiges néolithiques retrouvés dans la région font partie de la culture ibéromaurusienne. La ville est mentionnée dans les sources historiques à partir du Ve siècle av. J.-C. comme faisant partie du monde libyco-berbère. Ouverte aux échanges maritimes, la ville connaitra l'influence et un comptoir phénicien qui la fera connaitre sous le nom de Salda et, à l'époque romaine, sous le nom de Saldae. Les Vandales s'y établissent avant d'abandonner la ville et de transférer leur capitale à Carthage. La ville est islamisée à partir du VIIIe siècle, en effet elle est prise tardivement par les Arabes en 708, puis mentionnée au Xe siècle par le géographe andalou Abū ʿUbayd al-Bakrī qui parle d'une présence importante d'Andalous.\nElle devient une prestigieuse capitale, mais également un foyer religieux, commercial et savant de la Méditerranée sous la dynastie des Berbères hammadides au XIe siècle, qui la prennent pour capitale en lieu et place de la Qala'a des Béni Hammad.  Après un intermède almohade, elle redevient la capitale d'une branche des Hafsides puis siège un sultanat indépendant.\nRéputée en Europe pour la qualité de ses chandelles faites de cire d'abeille — auxquelles elle a donné son nom : les bougies — Béjaïa a également joué un rôle important dans la diffusion en Occident des chiffres arabes et des savoirs mathématiques locaux. Au Moyen Âge, des savants comme Raymond Lulle, Leonardo Fibonacci et Ibn Khaldoun y étudient.\nAprès un déclin progressif et relatif amorcé au XVe siècle (du fait notamment de reconfigurations dans le commerce mondial), Bejaïa conquise par les Espagnols en 1510 subit dès lors un net déclin qui se prolongera avec la reconquête par la régence d'Alger en 1555. Elle perd substantiellement sa culture savante ; ses grands établissements d'enseignement ne sont plus, ses grandes personnalités scientifiques n'y sont plus (partis en d'autres grandes cités du Maghreb et du Proche-Orient) ; seule subsiste l'institution théologique décentralisée des zaouïas. Elle est éclipsée, à l’échelle du Maghreb Central, par Alger siège du pouvoir politique et de la marine. Elle continue de tirer un certain prestige de ses mystiques religieux et de l'exportation du bois issu de l'arrière-pays. Elle est prise par les Français en 1833. Elle continue alors son déclin pour n'être plus qu'une ville portuaire moyenne, exportant des productions agricoles locales, puis renoue avec un certain dynamisme à la fin du XIXe siècle.\nLors de l'indépendance du pays, en 1962, elle retrouve un rôle culturel. En effet, grande ville berbérophone, elle devient un des foyers de la revendication identitaire berbère. Elle redevient aussi, progressivement, un port de première importance, talonnant celui d'Alger et devançant Oran.\nAvec ses 177 988 habitants au dernier recensement de 2008, Béjaïa est la plus grande ville de Kabylie et « capitale » de la petite Kabylie. Elle est aussi, grâce à sa situation géographique, le plus important pôle industriel de la région, notamment par la concentration de nombreuses industries, et la présence d'un des plus grands ports pétroliers et commerciaux de Méditerranée. Elle est également dotée d'un aéroport international.",

          "content": "## Overview\nBéjaïa is a city of 242,000 people (2017) in Central Algeria.\n\n## Understand\nBéjaïa is the largest principally Kabyle-speaking city (a Berber language) in the Kabylia region of Algeria.\nThe city centre of Béjaïa is made up of the colonial district and the old town, the medina, itself largely redesigned by the urban layouts of the time of the Spanish Empire, then of French Algeria. The old town is backed by the Gouraya massif. This sector retains some vestiges of the  ancient (notably on the archaeological level) or medieval buildings. The districts of Acherchour, Karamane and Bab El Louz still have Moorish houses. The lack of maintenance, public awareness and classification, the introduction of non-authentic materials (concrete, brick, etc.) threatens this heritage.\nThe defensive structures of the city are still present in the sector of the old city in various places (Bab el Bounoud, Hammadid wall near the port, Casbah). The colonial part of the city is illustrated in particular by the waterfront district, amputating part of the old town, and the port. Inspired by Haussmannian architecture, it also includes the famous Place du 1 er Novembre, also known as Place Geydon.\nBéjaïa's rich heritage extends well beyond the city: the ruins of Tiklat and the aqueduct of Tikdja, the Zianid citadel at El Kseur and the scholarly heritage displaced during periods of crisis such as the Spanish invasion of 1510, are as much heritage elements of the hinterland directly related to the history of the city.\n\n## Climate\nIt is generally humid with a slight seasonal temperature change. Average temperatures are generally mild and range from 11.1 °C in winter to 24.5 °C in summer.\n\n## Get in\nThe city of Béjaïa is connected to Algiers, Tizi Ouzou, Bouira, Sétif, Jijel and several Kabyle localities by an important road network.\n36.7372695.063721 Bus station (Gare Routière). Buses from Algiers frequently depart from Gare Routière Caroubier/Kharouba and take almost 4 hours. The bus station is about 2 km (1.2 mi) south of downtown. Bus lines connect it to cities in the great south of Algeria, including Hassi Messaoud, Ouargla, Ghardaïa, Laghouat, Djelfa and Bou Saada.    (updated Mar 2022)\n36.7119725.0694722 Soummam – Abane Ramdane Airport (French: Aéroport de Bejaia / Soummam – Abane Ramdane, BJA  IATA) (5 km south of the city). The airport receives flights from Paris, France and some others to Lyon, France, and Marseille, France. There are daily domestic flights mainly from Algiers.   (updated Mar 2022)\nTrain station (Gare Ferroviaire de Béjaia), 16 Av. Mustapha Ben Boulaïd, Béjaïa 06000. The train to Algiers leaves at 6:30 and arrives at 10:39. It leaves Algiers at 14:33, arriving in Bejaia at 18:38. Delays happen often. There are also trains to Akbou and Beni Mansour. (updated Mar 2024)\n\n## Get around\nThere are frequent buses within the city, costing 20 dinar. There are no buses within the national park.\n\n## See\nThe town is overlooked by the mountain Yemma Gouraya, whose profile is said to resemble a sleeping woman. Other nearby scenic spots include the Aiguades beach and the Pic des Singes (Peak of the Monkeys); the latter site is a habitat for the endangered Barbary macaque. All three of these geographic features are located in the Gouraya National Park.\nBorj Moussa museum, housed in an old Spanish fort from the 16th  century and where prehistoric Roman and Hafsid era remains are presented. The museum also houses a collection of birds and insects from all over Africa, as well as paintings by Maurice Boitel, on loan from the museum of Algiers.\nThe nearby town of Toudja has a museum dedicated to water transport techniques, particularly in Roman times. The surroundings include the ruins of the aqueduct used to transport water from Toudja to the city during Antiquity. The site contains mosaics, baths and cisterns from the Roman period\n\n## Do\nClimb the mountain next to town. Most locals will drive to the highest parking lot and only do the last part on foot. There are also some shared taxis that go there.\n36.77085.08131 Yemma Gouraya castle (يما قورايا). More a collection of stones than anything else. However the views are good.    (updated Mar 2022)\n36.769555.096162 Pic des singes (Monkey peak). Quite spectacular views in all directions. And there are monkeys around too.    (updated Mar 2022)\n36.7751855.1023153 Cap Carbon. A beautiful cape with a light house on top. Walking towards it offers a beautiful sight. The cape itself is a military zone, so one can not enter. Halfway, one can however walk around the cliffs toward Point Noir.    (updated Mar 2024)\n\n## Buy\nThe town serves as an outlet for Kabylian crafts (pottery, basketry, and products derived from local agriculture).\n\n## Eat\nNortheast Algeria is known for its delicious sea food. They are tons and tons of options. Seafood is usually served in restaurants or small food trucks as either a main dish, snack, appetizer, or soup. They’re a lot of restaurants that sell pizzas or grills. They’re also a lot of meat and vegan restaurants all around the city.\n\n## Drink\nAs in all Algeria, Algerian tea “Atay” are sold everywhere. From grocery stores to cafeterias to high end restaurants. It is really worth trying and it’s usually cheap.\n\n## Sleep\n36.7526445.070791 Hotel Brahmi (براهمي). Centrally located hotel.

          "content": "Annaba (Arabic: عنابة, lit. 'place of the Jujubes'), formerly known as Bon, Bona and Bône, is a seaport city in the northeastern corner of Algeria, close to the border with Tunisia. Annaba is near the small Seybouse River and is in Annaba Province. With a population of about 263,650 (2019) and 1,000,000 for the metropolitan area, Annaba is the third-largest city and the leading industrial center in Algeria.\nAnnaba is a coastal city that underwent significant growth during the 20th century. Annaba has a metropolitan area with a higher population density than the other metropolitan areas of the Algerian coastline, such as Oran and Algiers. Much of eastern and southern Algeria uses the services, equipment and infrastructure of Annaba. Economically, it is the centre for various economic activities, such as industry, transportation, finance, and tourism.\n\nNames\nPresent-day Annaba grew up on the site of Aphrodisium, the seaport of the Roman city Hippo Regius. (The modern city has since expanded south over Hippo's ruins as well.) Its former names Bône and Bona derived from \"Ubbo\", a local form of the name Hippo. Its informal name \"Land of the Jujubes\" (بلد العناب, Balad al-‘Unnāb) derives from the abundance of that fruit in the region.\n\nHistory\nAncient\nThe area of Annaba has yielded evidence of very early human occupation at Ain el Hanech, near Saïda (circa 200,000 BC), including artifacts that show remarkable toolmaking craftsmanship. According to some sources, prehistoric Algeria was the site of the most advanced development of flake-tool techniques in the Middle Early Stone Age (Middle Paleolithic).\nThe town of Hippo Regius (modern Annaba) first entered historical records at the end of the 3rd century BCE as a possession of Massinissa's Numidian Kingdom. Augustine of Hippo was bishop here from 396 AD until his death in 430 AD. The city was destroyed in the 5th century by the Vandals. Vandals ruled the city for roughly a century until 534. Gelimer, the King of the Vandals and Alans from 530 to 534 AD, faced with the starvation of his followers and their children, and realizing he had no chance of regaining his kingdom of North Africa, surrendered to Flavius Belisarius, a general of the Byzantine Empire under Justinian I, at Bône. Byzantines then ruled Hippona (Hippo's new name after 395) before the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in 699 AD. Later, Abbasids, Aghlabids, and Fatimids ruled Bona before the rise of the Zirids. It was relocated to its present place after flooding and Banu Hilal the ravages that occurred in 1033 during Hammadid rule. It was attacked by a Pisan fleet in 1034 and was conquered by Kingdom of Sicily in 1153. The Almohads took it in 1160.\n\nAl-Bakri, in the 11th century, wrote about the city:\"Bona is an ancient city, it is the city of Augustine, the scholar of Christianity. It is located on the coast of the sea, on a high and fortified piece of land overlooking the city of Seboussa. Today, it is called the city of Zawa, and it is about three miles away from the modern city. It has mosques, markets, and a public bath. The land is fertile, with fruits and crops. The modern city of Bona was surrounded by walls after the year 450 [Hijri year]. In the modern city of Bona, there is a well by the sea, carved in solid rock, called the well of Nithra, from which most of the inhabitants drink.\"\nDuring the 11th century, the Banu Hilal, an Arab tribe living between the Nile and the Red Sea, settled in Tunisia, Tripolitania (western Libya) and Constantinois (eastern Algeria) which was the portion known as Annaba.\nAfter the demise of the Almohads, the rule of the Hafsids began in Annaba in 1250. Hafsid rule was interrupted by brief occupations of the Marinids and Castile (in 1360) and ended with that of the Zayyanids. Rule by the Ottoman Empire began in 1533, and that lasted until French occupation in 1832, excepting rule by the Spanish Empire between 1535 and 1540. The Barbary pirates also lived in Annaba from the 16th through 19th centuries.\n\nModern\nDuring the rule of France (empire and republics), this city was called Bône. It was one of the main French settlements, and it still has a sizeable minority of the \"Pied-Noir\". One notable pied-noir from Bône was General Alphonse Juin, a Marshal of France and then the Central European NATO Commander.\nConstruction was undertaken at Bône during 1856–69 to build an 80-hectare (200-acre) sheltered port to handle the iron ore from the Mokta el Hadid.\nA short railroad line was built from the iron ore mine at Ain Mokra to the docks of Bône. This railway was opened in 1864, the first one to be built in Algeria. Full-scale production or iron ore began in 1865. Also in 1865, Emperor Napoleon III visited Algeria, including going to the mine and the city of Bône.\nIn 1865, the mine produced 22,000 tonnes of iron ore, which increased to 255,000 tonnes in 1869. The ore was extracted from underground galleries, and then shipped from Bône to the French iron and steel works. Before the mine was opened, Bône had just 10,000 inhabitants. By 1924, there were 41,000 people, and the port was being used to export phosphates, lead ore, and zinc ore, too.\nDuring World War II in 1943, Bône was an important goal of the U.S. Army and British Army in Operation Torch, advancing eastward from Morocco, Oran, and Algiers across North Africa. Bône was a crucial highway and sea location for the invasion of Tunisia, and thence the driving of the Axis powers (Germany and Italy) out of Africa in May 1943.\nBône remained in Allied hands until the end of the war in 1945, and then it remained a part of French Algeria until the independence of Algeria in 1962.\n\nDemography\nThe city of Annaba had a population of 257,359 in 2008 (General Census of the population and habitat). In 1988, the population of the urban district of Annaba had increased to 359,657 (with El Bouni comprising 111,956 inhabitants). The cities of If El Hadjar, and Sidi Amar are also included. Currently there are approximately 500,000 people in \"greater Annaba\". Today  Annaba has a population of 464,740 and 1,000,000 in greater Annaba.\n\nGeography\nThe city is located in the northeastern corner of Algeria, close to the border with Tunisia. Annaba is near the small Seybouse River and is in located in the Annaba Province.\n\nClimate\nAnnaba has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa in the Köppen climate classification) with long, hot, dry summers, especially from mid-July to mid-August, and mild, wet winters. Snow is rare but not unknown. Rain is abundant by North African standards and can be torrential.\n\nUrban areas\nThe metropolitan area includes the cities of El Bouni, El Hadjar and Sidi Amar, which now form a circle around the city of Annaba. The city has grown dramatically since a major factory was opened at El Hadjar (10 km (6.2 mi) to the South) and provides employment for the entire region.\nThe downtown district of Annaba is on the sea-front, and includes the promenade called the Concours de la Revolution (previously called Le Cours Bertagna) which is a lively area, brimming with arcades and all kinds of covered restaurants, terraced cafes and kiosks. Annaba also has an international airport.\n\nEducation\nOne of Annaba's most notable educational institutions is the University of Annaba. As of 2004, there are over 40,000 students enrolled.\n\nThere is a branch campus of the French international school Lycée international Alexandre-Dumas.\n\nEconomy\nAs of 1911, Annaba was producing iron, zinc, cork, livestock, and cereal.\nThe city is an important hub of the world steel industry with the steel complex of El Hadjar, 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south of the city. It is the largest in Africa. Phosphate and metal industries now include the Seybousa complex and the metallurgical complex of Allelik. The private industrial sector is also very important in Annaba and geared especially to the agri-food, metal processing, wood products and construction. These industrial areas occupy nearly 400 hectares (990 acres) between Bouchet Bridge, Meboudja, Berrahal and Kherraza. Business areas are also to be found in the suburbs of the city, such as Sidi Salem, El Eulma and Wadi El-Aneb.\n\nTransportation\nAnnaba was described as the \"chief seaport of Algeria after Oran and Algiers,\" by Baedeker's in 1911.\nAnnaba is served by Rabah Bitat Airport, an international airport whose IATA airport code is AAE. Annaba also has rail links to the Algerian cities of Constantine and Algiers, and it is at the end of Algeria's east–west highway. It is the second industrial centre in Algeria after the capital Algiers.\n\nTourism\nAnnaba is an important centre for tourism, and is one of the major tourist attractions in the western Mediterranean. It is a coastal city with mountains, hills, foothills, and plains surrounding it. Due to this, and aside from maritime and seaside tourism, Annaba has a key potential for mountain tourism. The mountains around Seraïdi which rise to 1,080 metres (3,540 ft), make them a major tourist attraction. Other tourist attractions are West Bay, Djenane el Bey (La Grande Plage), Ras el Hamra and Ain Achir beach.\nAnnaba also has various key religious sites, including the Saint Augustin Basilica. Annaba in its early history, was the site of an important and influential Diocese, prior to its destruction by the Vandals, and the era of Islamisation. Annaba is located on the Tunisian border, and is a visa-free area, hence tourists are also able to make side trips to Tunisia and to El Kala National Park.\nAnnaba is also known for its verdant Main Street (more often known as the Concours de la Revolution), which is a bustling promenade also well known for its night-life. The Annaba area is generally reputed for having scenic beaches, hotels and a bustling nightlife.\nThe War Cemetery at Bône lies 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from Annaba on the road towards Constantine. It is an important memorial to the British Empire's soldiers and airmen who fought in the region during the World War II, with 868 Commonwealth burials there. There are also 14 other graves, mostly of merchant seamen. It was designed by J. Hubert Worthington. After the war, most of the American dead were repatriated for burial in the United States, but this was not traditional in the British Empire.\n\nNotable people\nJuba I of Numidia (ca. 85–46 BC), Berber king of Numidia and Mauretania\nJuba II (ca. 48 BC – AD 23), son of Juba I, king of Numidia and spouse of Cleopatra Selene II\nAugustine of Hippo (354–430), also known as Saint Augustine, Bishop of Hippo Regius (present-day Annaba)\nAhmad al-Buni, (died 1225), born in Bône (now Annaba), well-known Sufi and writer on the esoteric value of letters and topics relating to mathematics, sihr (sorcery) and spirituality.\nAlphonse Juin (1888–1967), born in Bône, French pied-noir general during World Wars I & II\nRaoul Borra (1896-1988), born in Bône, French politician\nMohamed Boudiaf (1919–1992), Algerian president, assassinated in Annaba\nRobert Cohen (1930–2022), born in Bône, French boxer\nEustache Cuicci (1908-1980), French politician\nProfessor Alain Ferry (born 1939), writer, awarded the 2009 Prix Médicis\nEdwige Fenech (born 1948), born in Bône, Italian actress\nMichèle Victory (born 1958), French politician\n\nIn the arts\nAn engraving of a painting by J Salmon,  Town and Harbour of Bona, Africa. was published in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837 along with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon entitled Bona, The Pirate's Song.\n\nSee also\nEuropean enclaves in North Africa before 1830\nEdough Massif\n\nNotes\nSources\nExternal links\n\n(in French) Annaba City\n(in French) Annaba",

          "content": "Annaba (en arabe : عنابة, en berbère : ⴱⵓⵏⴰ), anciennement Hippone, Bouna, puis Bône lors de la colonisation française et surnommée « Medinet Zaoui » ou encore « La Coquette », est la quatrième ville d'Algérie en nombre d'habitants après la capitale Alger, Oran et Constantine.\nLa ville d'Annaba est située dans le nord-est du pays, à 536 km à l'est d'Alger, à 106 km à l'ouest de la frontière tunisienne, et à quelque 200 km au sud de la Sardaigne. Annaba est une métropole littorale dont la population de l'agglomération dépassait 600 000 habitants en 2008.\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nAnnaba se situe dans le nord-est de l'Algérie, sur la rive sud du bassin algéro-provençal, à l'extrémité nord-est de sa wilaya. Elle est distante de 600 km de la capitale Alger et 106 km la séparent de la frontière tunisienne. La ville s'élève au fond d'une baie ouverte à l'est sur le golfe d'Annaba. Elle est dominée à l'ouest par la chaîne de montagne de l'Edough (1 008 m d'altitude).\n\nRelief et hydrographie\nLe massif de l'Edough : Annaba se situe sur le bord est de l'Edough, massif montagneux culminant à 1 008 m d'altitude.\nL'oued Seybouse : il a son embouchure (détournée au début des années 1970, à l'occasion de la construction d'une usine de production d'engrais chimiques) au sud-est de la ville qui rejoint la mer Méditerranée. Son bassin est le plus étendu d’Algérie et ses terres sont des plus fertiles.\nLe Lac de Fetzara : il est situé à l’ouest de la ville, à 14 km de la mer Méditerranée. Il s’allonge dans le sens est-ouest sur 17 km de long et sur 13 km de large. Il est limité au nord par le massif de l’Edough, par les collines de Aïn Berda au sud et les cordons dunaires situés à l’est et à l’ouest. À la périphérie du lac existent plusieurs agglomérations : au nord, le chef-lieu de la commune de Berrahal, au sud les territoires des communes d’El Eulma (Oued El Hout) et de Cheurfa et, à l’est, les petits villages d’El Gantra et de Oued Zied.\n\nClimat\nAnnaba bénéficie d'un climat méditerranéen. Elle est connue pour ses longs étés chauds et secs. Les hivers y sont doux et humides ; les jours de neige sont rares. Les pluies sont abondantes et peuvent être diluviennes. Il fait généralement chaud surtout de la mi-juillet à la mi-août.\n\nTransports\nAnnaba dispose d'une gare ferroviaire située à proximité de la gare maritime et de la gare routière.\nL'aéroport d'Annaba - Rabah Bitat est situé à 9 km au sud de la ville. Des vols opérés par la compagnie Air Algérie relient Annaba à Alger et à Oran, et aux villes françaises de Paris, Lyon, Marseille et Nice, à la ville turque d’Istanbul ainsi qu'à Milan en Italie. Des liaisons avec Médine et Djeddah, en Arabie saoudite, sont également effectuées lors du pèlerinage de la Mecque.\nLa ville est dotée d'un port faisant partie des dix ports de commerce algériens et abritant des bateaux qui assurent le transport de passagers jusqu'à Marseille ou l'Italie.\n\nUne nouvelle gare maritime y est en construction. Sa mise en service est prévue pour la fin de l'année 2019.\n\nUrbanisme\nL'agglomération englobe les villes d'El Bouni, El Hadjar et Sidi Amar, qui forment à présent une véritable couronne autour de la ville d'Annaba et dont les liens avec cette dernière sont de plus en plus denses. La ville s'est considérablement développée depuis l'implantation de l'usine métallurgique d'El Hadjar (à une dizaine de kilomètres au sud) qui draine de la main d'œuvre de toute la région.\nLe centre-ville d'Annaba, où est situé le cours de la Révolution (ancien cours Bertagna), déborde d'arcades en tous genres où s'abritent restaurants, terrasses et kiosques divers.\nAnnaba est une ville à l’urbanisme dynamique, avec des quartiers variés entre mer et montagne\nqui offrent un cadre de vie diversifié. Les quartiers historiques, résidentiels et en mutation témoignent d’une métropole en pleine croissance.\n\nToponymie\nL'une des plus anciennes cités de l'Algérie, la ville a porté successivement les noms d'Ubon[réf. nécessaire], HippoRegius, Hippone, Bouna, Bled El Anneb, Bône et enfin Annaba.\nAutrefois, on l'appelait Bilad Al unnāb, c'est-à-dire la ville des jujubes (ar) عُنابا ('unab), à cause de la grande production de ce fruit dans cet endroit[réf. nécessaire].\n\nHistoire\nPréhistoire\nLa région d'Annaba est riche en découvertes archéologiques datant de la Préhistoire de - 2 millions d'années. Les Homo erectus auraient vécu dans cette région depuis le Paléolithique supérieur (-1,8 million d'années à -100 000 ans). À partir du Néolithique, un nouveau type d'humains fait son apparition : le « Protoméditerranéen ».\nL'homme est apparu dans le périmètre d'Annaba depuis le Paléolithique, dans la zone de Ras-Al-Hamra (Cap de Garde), dans les collines de Bouhamra. Les hommes préhistoriques ont laissé de nombreux témoignages dans la région de Bône : silex taillés ou polis, menhirs, cromlechs, dolmens, que ce soit à Roknia pour le plus connu ou bien encore à Guelma, Le Tarf ou Chapuis.\nEn parallèle, une autre civilisation dite capsienne s'est développée dans la région de Gafsa qui se situait au Sud-Ouest de la Tunisie. Les Capsiens, sur le plan anthropologique, sont très similaires aux habitants de l'Afrique du Nord. Les préhistoriens affirment donc que les premiers Maghrébins sont issus des Protoméditerranéens Capsiens, qui représentent la première lignée berbère.\nÀ la fin du Ve millénaire av. J.-C., fin de l'ère Néolithique, débute l'ère de la Préhistoire (-5 000 à - 3 000 ans). Les archéologues découvrent lors de leurs recherches en Afrique du Nord architecture, des sépultures funéraires et des poteries rudimentaires datant de cette époque.\nLes découvertes prouvant l'existence passée de l'homme préhistorique dans la région d'Annaba sont les mêmes que dans tout le bassin méditerranéen : armes et outils en pierre, abris sous roches, sépultures de pierre brute, dolmens, etc.\n\nAntiquité : fondation d'Hippone\nC'est un ancien comptoir punique fondé durant l'extension de la civilisation des Phéniciens au-delà de leurs frontières originelles. Sa création se situe à l'arrivée de ces derniers sur les côtes de l'océan Atlantique vers 2 000 ans av. J.-C.. Il est connu que les Phéniciens excellaient dans la navigation marine, car ils avaient compris que la prospérité, la fructification de leurs richesses et le développement économique ne pouvaient provenir qu'au-delà des limites marines. II leur fallait donc traverser océans et mers pour assouvir leurs buts expansionnistes. Mais les distances lointaines entre la Phénicie et les grands centres commerciaux ou les grandes villes situées le long de la façade marine du continent les poussèrent à établir des comptoirs commerciaux. C'est dans cet ordre d'idées qu'en 1100 av. J.-C., les Phéniciens de la ville de Tyr fondèrent en Afrique antique (l'actuelle Tunisie) la ville d'Utique, considérée comme leur plus ancien comptoir. Plus tard, vers 814 av. J.-C. fut fondée Qarthadesh (Carthage), c'est-à-dire « la ville nouvelle ». Des activités commerciales se sont développées avec les Phéniciens, qui y faisaient souvent escale au retour de leurs campagnes cabotières au pays des Tartessiens (sud-est de l'Espagne). Ces Phéniciens étaient des sémites du groupe cananéen venus de la côte du Liban actuel).\nDu VIe au IIIe siècle av. J.-C., Hippone (ou Hippot) se soumet à l'hégémonie carthaginoise. Au IIIe siècle av. J.-C., la consolidation du royaume numide, notamment sous le règne de Massinissa et de ses successeurs, entraîne l'intégration d'Hippone au royaume numide ; elle devient une ville royale, Hippo Regius. Ce rang est dû probablement à son rôle de port assurant les liaisons entre l'arrière-pays et la Méditerranée.\nGrâce aux Phéniciens, qui y ont apporté les connaissances et savoir-faire de toutes les civilisations du Moyen-Orient, la cité devient l'un des grands centres de la nouvelle province numide soumise aux Romains, l'Africa Nova. Les vestiges actuels correspondent à la phase romaine puis aux phases vandale et byzantine.\nL'histoire d'Hippone se confond avec celle de Carthage, dont elle adopte peu à peu les mœurs, les coutumes, la religion et la langue.\nLa prospérité de Carthage provoque des rivalités avec ses voisins. Trois groupes prédominent à l'époque en Afrique du Nord : les Maures à l'ouest, les Gétules au sud et les Numides à l'est et au centre. La Numidie est alors divisée en deux royaumes : celui des Masaesyles à l'ouest et celui des Massyles à l'est. Les guerres puniques embrasent tout le monde antique. Hippone et sa région sont alors envahies par les Massyles, dont le roi Massinissa était allié aux Romains. Hippone connaît l'indépendance et la paix seulement après la chute de Carthage en - 146.\nOn pense qu'Hippone est choisie, à la fin de la seconde guerre punique, comme résidence favorite des rois Numides, lui donnant, du fait de sa situation géographique, le prestige d'une « ville de plaisance » après la chute de Carthage. Elle est appelée « ville royale » pendant tout un siècle.\nLa particularité d'Hippone à l'époque chrétienne est d'être devenue un centre de rayonnement de la pensée théologique de son évêque, saint Augustin (354-430).\n\nHippone chrétienne (240 à 670) - Saint Augustin (354-430)\nLe christianisme a dû faire son apparition en Afrique du Nord au début du IIIe siècle. Les premiers Africains convertis à cette nouvelle religion ont été torturés et livrés aux fauves par les Romains, notamment lors de la Grande persécution de Dioclétien (303-304). La Paix de Maxence (307) ouvre une période de tolérance, troublée au sein de l'Église d'Afrique par l'apparition du donatisme : à l'occasion de la succession de l'évêque de Carthage, une fraction de l'église fait sécession sous la direction de Donat, donnant lieu à un schisme, le donatisme, qui subira une alternance de tolérance et de répression, tout en n'hésitant pas à pratiquer lui-même la violence et persécution. Le conflit, théologique et matériel, entre le catholicisme et ce schisme africain, durera jusqu'à l'extinction du donatisme pendant la domination vandale.\nEn 362, l'empereur Julien autorisa la pratique de toutes les tendances du christianisme. Mais en 380, l'empereur Théodose Ier déclara le catholicisme religion officielle de l'Empire.\nC'est à partir de 395 que l'évêque d'Hippone Augustin (futur saint Augustin) développa les arguments contre le donatisme. Se sentant personnellement menacé, il fit appel à l'autorité impériale; l'édit de Ravenne de 412 déclara le donatisme hors la loi. Par la hauteur de ses vues et la qualité de ses écrits, Augustin fit d'Hippone un centre de rayonnement de la pensée chrétienne au début du Ve siècle, jouant un rôle primordial dans la consolidation du catholicisme, et établissant les assises définitives de l'église moderne, dont il sera considéré comme un des Pères et Docteurs.\nLocalement, il fonda à Hippone un monastère.\n\nInvasion vandale (431-533) - Reconquête byzantine (533)\nLes Vandales (peuple germanique), chassés par les Huns (peuple nomade d'Asie centrale), envahissent la Gaule (406), l'Espagne (409), et franchissent le détroit de Gibraltar en 429 pour conquérir l'Afrique du Nord. Ils sont chrétiens, mais adeptes d'une conception dissidente de la nature du Christ, l'arianisme (rejeté comme hérétique par le premier concile de Nicée de 325).\nEn mai 430, Hippone fut assiégée. La ville résista 18 mois, mais les campagnes voisines furent pillées. Au cours de ce siège, l'évêque Augustin décéda. L'église se hâta d'assurer la conservation de la bibliothèque et des manuscrits du futur saint peu après son décès. La mort de cette éminente figure de l'orthodoxie coïncide ainsi avec la défaite romaine dans la région sous les coups des Vandales. La ville devint la capitale de Genséric et de ses successeurs, maîtres de toute l'Afrique du Nord (anciennes provinces de Numidie et de Proconsulaire [Est algérien et Tunisie] pendant plus d'un siècle, mises à part Cirta et Carthage, qui tombera en 439). Hippone connaîtra alors une période de relative tranquillité (mais aussi d'atrophie à tous les niveaux), toutefois troublée par quelques révoltes berbères.\nEn 533, une armée de Constantinople, sous le commandement de Bélisaire, fut envoyée par l'empereur byzantin Justinien Ier, qui se considérait comme héritier de l'ensemble de l'Empire romain, pour reprendre aux Vandales le contrôle de l'Afrique du Nord. La bataille de Tricaméron marquera la chute des Vandales. Mais malgré tous leurs efforts, les Byzantins ne parvinrent pas à redonner à la ville son éclat d'antan, tout au plus constitua-t-elle une escale ou un point de ravitaillement pour la flotte byzantine.\n\nPériode des dynasties islamiques\nLa conquête de l'Afrique du Nord est conduite depuis l'Égypte par petites vagues à partir de 647. Mais des luttes de succession obligent, pour un temps, les Arabes à mettre fin à leurs expéditions. L'arrivée au pouvoir des omeyyades marque la reprise de la politique d'expansion. Les Arabes se lancent à la conquête de « l'île du Maghreb » . C'est au cours de cette seconde expédition que la Numidie orientale connut les premiers raids de l'armée arabe. Vers 666, les troupes de Mu'awiya, peu après leurs conquêtes de Djerba et Bizerte, déferlent sur Hippone. Protégée par de solides remparts et défendue par les forces byzantines, le siège de la cité fut de courte durée ; les Arabes ne la quittèrent qu'après l'avoir en partie incendiée. Tandis que Berbères, Byzantins et Arabes s'entretuaient, Hippone eut à connaître un certain regain d'activité du fait du débarquement d'une imposante garnison venue de Constantinople, renforçant à nouveau leur autorité sur l'ensemble du pays. La fondation de Kairouan, en 670 par Okba Ibn Nafî, marque définitivement l'installation des Arabes en Ifriqiya (la Tunisie et l'est du Constantinois).\nAprès la conquête définitive de Carthage en 698, Hippone devient un refuge pour les Carthaginois puis sera dévastée par les Arabes après avoir mis un terme à la résistance de l'autorité impériale byzantine. L'antique cité Berbère, Numide, romaine et byzantine, sera par la suite en partie restaurée, après sa destruction partielle en 666 et adaptée à un nouveau mode vie oriental.\nL'ancienne Hippone, est alors rebaptisée par les Arabes « Médinet Seybouse » puis officiellement « Bouna », plus facile à prononcer que Hippone. Vaincues, certaines tribus berbères se convertissent et contribuent à leur tour à l'expansion de l'islam.\nAu début du XIe siècle, la ville antique est abandonnée pour un nouveau site à 3 km au nord du premier. La nouvelle ville « Bouna Al Haditha » (« Bouna la Neuve ») est bâtie sur une hauteur de 40 mètres d'altitude, à la différence de l'antique qui se trouve au bord de la mer (1 à 3 mètres d'altitude).\nDès l'année 1040, la ville s'entoure de remparts pour renforcer sa défense naturelle. Les Sanhadjas, qui la fondent, en font un poste de défense et de surveillance. Bouna devient un port d'échanges commerciaux du XIe au XIXe siècle.\nEn 1153, le roi de Sicile, Roger II, d'origine normande, conquiert la ville de Bône et y règne avec son fils Guillaume Ier pendant quelques années, jusqu'en 1158. Guillaume Ier, Roi de Sicile, est connu pour avoir accueilli savants et lettrés à Palerme, et notamment le grand géographe Al-Idrissi (1100-1165). Guillaume Ier se replie par la suite à Mahdia (à 475 km à l'est) jusqu'en 1160.\n\nPériode ottomane et espagnole\nL'empereur Charles Quint envoie en 1535 une escadre espagnole pour conquérir Bouna (la citadelle d'Annaba). Il ordonne la destruction de la muraille qui joint la ville à la forteresse. Mais face au blocus maritime des Turcs et l'hostilité de la population, des dizaines de soldats espagnols succombent. En 1540, Charles Quint ordonna l'évacuation de Bouna.\nAprès la reprise de la ville contre les troupes de Charles Quint, les autorités turques fortifient la ville et la surmontent d'un fort Cigogne. Pour la relier à ses colonies occidentales, les Turcs décident d'inclure la ville et sa région dans la régence d'Alger.\nBouna (Bona) est parée d'un nouveau qualificatif : « Madinat Al Unnab », ou Annaba, qui va lentement se substituer à son ancien nom de 'Bouna', à la fin du XIXe siècle et aujourd'hui.\nLa fonction de point d'échanges commerciaux, notamment avec l'étranger, fait d'Annaba et sa région une des assiettes de l'établissement de concessions commerciales européennes, prémices d'un développement économique plus important.\n\nPériode française (1830-1962)\nLes troupes françaises, avec à leur tête, Anne Jean Marie René Savary, duc de Rovigo, qui commande à Alger, souhaitent étendre l'action de la France vers l'Est et reprendre Bône, occupée la première fois par le général Damrémont en 1830, et une deuxième fois en 1831, par le commandant Huder ; mais par deux fois, il a fallu évacuer la ville dans des conditions assez difficiles du fait de l'absence de voies de communication protégées.\n\nEn avril 1832, le capitaine Édouard Buisson d'Armandy s'installe dans Bône avec ses canonniers. D'Armandy envoie au duc de Rovigo, à Alger, un billet lui expliquant que grâce aux trente marins de la Béarnaise, ils ont pris la citadelle de Bône mais sont face aux 5 000 hommes du bey de Constantine. Ils attendent des renforts. Les premiers jours sont difficiles et les vivres manquent. Enfin, le 8 avril, les renforts arrivent avec le brick La Surprise. Le maréchal Jean-de-Dieu Soult, ministre de la Guerre, à la tribune de la Chambre affirme : « La prise de Bône est le plus beau fait d'armes du siècle ».\nBône reste sous administration militaire jusqu'au 17 février 1845. Son territoire est délimité par une ordonnance du 12 février 1844. Elle est érigée en commune de plein exercice par une ordonnance du 31 janvier 1848. Elle est intégrée au Département de Constantine, créé en décembre de la même année. Sa municipalité est organisée par décret du 8 juillet 1854.\n\nLe développement économique peut alors se poursuivre avec la mise en valeur de Bône par de grands travaux dans la plaine bônoise qui, à l'origine marécageuse, devient une région très prospère, grâce à des cultures maraîchères, viticoles et arboricoles. Les vins de Bône seront connus et réputés jusqu'à Paris sous Napoléon III et le baron Haussmann.\nLe Seybouse, qui arrose cette plaine, permet l'irrigation intensive des terres avoisinantes et enrichit la région de nouvelles cultures.\nL'industrie se développe aussi largement, avec une usine de traitement des phosphates, plusieurs coopératives agricoles prospères, le développement du port de commerce de Bône, équipé du plus récent matériel de manutention. Du port de Bône partaient les différents minerais originaires du djebel Kouif et de l'Ouenza vers la France, et y arrivaient tous les équipements techniques, mécaniques, chimiques et agricoles pour toute la région Est du Constantinois. L'ensemble des ressources humaines et des entrepreneurs régionaux font de Bône l'une des plus riches villes des départements d'Algérie.\nLes deux conflits mondiaux, outre la mobilisation des jeunes hommes dans l'armée, atteignent aussi la ville de Bône. Le 4 août 1914, Bône est bombardé par le croiseur Breslau de la Mittelmeerdivision de la marine impériale allemande tandis que Philippeville est attaqué par le croiseur Goeben faisant de nombreux morts dans cette seconde ville \nEnviron cent quarante coups entre 3 h 40 et 4 h 30, puis le bâtiment se dérobe vers le nord-ouest. Un employé du port est tué, André Gaglione est le premier mort français de la guerre. Il y a cinq blessés. Les dégâts se limitent à un petit cargo, le Saint-Thomas, sévèrement endommagé, à quelques immeubles et au sémaphore, également endommagés\nAu cours de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, Bône sert de base d'opérations aux armées britannique et américaine, débarquées le 13 novembre 1942 par terre et par mer. Bône subit de violents bombardements pendant l'hiver 1942-43.\nLa croix de guerre sera remise à la ville en juin 1949 par le président de la République Vincent Auriol pour son courage et sa vaillance face aux troupes allemandes.\nLa loi no 55-1082 du 7 août 1955 crée le département de Bône dont la ville est le chef-lieu.\nEn 1958, Bône compte 110 000 habitants et continue son développement.\n\nPremière et Seconde Guerre mondiale\nLe 4 août 1914, les premiers bombardements navals furent lancés sur Bône et Philippeville (Skikda). Le nombre d'obus lancés sur la ville a été estimé à 140. Les cibles visées étaient la gare ferroviaire, l'usine de gaz, les casernes, le port et le cap de Garde. Cette guerre dura quatre ans et toucha tout le pays.\nEn septembre 1939 éclate la Seconde Guerre mondiale. L'Allemagne nazie bat tous ses adversaires jusqu'en 1942, la Grande-Bretagne ne parvenant à tenir, seule, que grâce à la protection de l'océan. Britanniques et Français libres parviennent aussi péniblement à défendre l'Égypte contre les forces de l'Axe.\nUn troisième front s'ouvre en juin 1941 quand Hitler se retourne contre son allié Staline. La guerre gagne toute l'Afrique du Nord en novembre 1942, lorsque les Anglo-Américains débarquent en Afrique française du Nord (AFN) avec 100 000 soldats, et rééquipent l'armée française d'Afrique avec du matériel moderne.\nLes troupes américaines débarquent à Bougie, à Philippeville (Skikda) et à Bône sans rencontrer d'opposition. Mais le sort de Bône est gravement compromis en raison du manque de DCA et d'avions.\nLe 13 novembre 1942, des avions nazis larguent sur Bône des bombes meurtrières. Ces bombardements se poursuivirent jusqu'au 30 juin 1943. Le calme revient quand les Alliés envahissent l'Italie.\nSelon des sources officielles, en huit mois, 1 800 bombes ont été lancées sur le port et la ville de Bône. Le bilan des victimes civiles était de 164 morts dont 123 musulmans, 202 blessés dont 113 musulmans. Quant aux victimes militaires, on comptait 885 soldats alliés.\nLa ville a été décorée, le 11 novembre 1948, de la Croix de guerre 1939-1945 avec palme de bronze.\n\nIndépendance\nL'indépendance de l'Algérie en 1962 entraîne le départ des populations européenne et juive de la ville. Dans l'Algérie indépendante, la ville connaît une augmentation rapide de sa population alimentée par l'exode rural, pour atteindre plus de 400 000 habitants aujourd'hui dans sa grande agglomération.\nLe président algérien Mohamed Boudiaf a été assassiné à Annaba le 29 juin 1992, au début de la guerre civile algérienne des années 1990.\n\nÉconomie\nIndustrie\nL'agglomération d'Annaba constitue le deuxième pôle industriel du pays après celui de la capitale Alger. La ville est un important lieu pour la sidérurgie, avec le complexe sidérurgique d'El Hadjar — qui est le plus grand d'Afrique[réf. nécessaire] — privatisé en 2001 et renationalisé en octobre 2013 après le basculement de 51 % du capital sous le contrôle de l'État algérien par le rachat des parts d'ArcelorMittal qui demeure cependant le maître-d'œuvre du site. Situé à huit kilomètres au sud de la ville, il s'étend sur 800 hectares, est associé à l'exploitation des mines d'Ouenza et de Bouhadjar, comprend deux hauts fourneaux, trois aciéries et des laminoirs à chaud, à froid et à fil et rond. Les industries du phosphate et du métal sont présentes à travers le complexe phosphatier de la Seybouse et le complexe métallurgique d'Allelik.\nL'industrie privée est très importante à Annaba et se concentre notamment dans l'agro-alimentaire, la transformation métallique, le bois et ses dérivés, le BTP.\nLes zones industrielles occupent près de 400 ha entre Pont Bouchet, Meboudja, Berrahal, Kherraza. Des zones d'activités sont situées dans la banlieue de la ville, à Sidi Salem, El-Eulma et Oued El-Aneb. L'extension de la zone industrielle d'Annaba est associée à la construction de la nouvelle ville de Draa Errich, distante de 20 km.\n\nTourisme\nLa ville d'Annaba est une des principales communes touristiques d'Algérie mais elle reste encore assez peu fréquentée par les étrangers. Annaba a vu la mise en place d'un plan d'aménagement touristique qui sera destiné à promouvoir ce secteur dans les années à venir, elle dispose d'immenses plaines longeant des montagnes, tel que les monts de l'Edough. La ville ainsi que son agglomération sont bordées par près de quarante kilomètres de côtes, ces plages attirent durant l'été des milliers de touristes nationaux.\n\nLa ville abrite plusieurs plages : Joannonville (Sidi Salem, Joino), le lever de l'aurore (Vedro), Plage des juifs, Saint-Cloud (Rezgi Rachid), Chapuis (Rizzi Amor), La Caroube (Kharouba), Toche (Reffas Zahouane), Le Belvedère, Ain Achir, Le Cap de Garde (Le Vivier).\n\nDémographie\nLa ville d'Annaba comptait 257 359 habitants en 2008 (Recensement général de la population et de l'habitat). Son agglomération comptait 359 657 (avec 111 956 habitants à El Bouni en 1998). Si l'on y inclut El Hadjar, et Sidi Amar dont les extrémités tendent à se rejoindre, c'est près de 500 000 personnes qui appartiennent au « Grand Annaba » La métropole d'Annaba comptait 1 000 000 habitants en 2008, si on ajoute les villes très proches comme Berrahel, la nouvelle ville Mostafa Ben Aouda, Echatt, Ben Mehidi ou encore Drean.\n\nAdministration\nListe des maires\nJumelages\nLa ville d'Annaba est jumelée avec plusieurs villes :\n\n Dunkerque Grand Littoral (France) depuis 1970 ;\n Saint-Étienne (France) depuis 1982 ;\n Bizerte (Tunisie) depuis 1985 ;\n Iekaterinbourg (Russie) depuis le 14 août 2009.\n\nCulture et traditions\nReligion\nComme dans le reste de l'Algérie, les habitants de la ville d'Annaba sont majoritairement de confession musulmane, avec une minorité chrétienne d'origine européenne dévote de Saint-Augustin d'Hippone. La ville d'Annaba contient plusieurs édifices religieux dont une basilique antique située aux ruines antiques de la ville, des mosquées d'époque médiévale, ottomane et moderne mais également plusieurs tombeaux de saints musulmans. Il subsiste une synagogue antique datant de la destruction du temple de Jérusalem située dans le quartier de la vieille ville. Cependant, il existe une communauté chrétienne implantée lors de la colonisation française constituée de français, maltais, italiens et d'africains. Cette présence chrétienne est également due à la présence antique de la religion chrétienne dans la région d'Annaba qui fut la région de Saint Augustin. Le premier colloque international sur le père de l'église catholique et sa pensée, fut organisé dans la ville en avril 2001. Cette ville fait office de pèlerinage de chrétiens venus pour la plupart d'Europe. La basilique Saint-Augustin, consacrée le 29 mars 1900, est une basilique mineure depuis le 24 avril 1914 et la procathédrale du diocèse de Constantine depuis 1964.\n\nIslam\nLes habitants de la ville d'Annaba sont sunnites de rite malékite, avec une minorité adepte du rite hanafite apparue lors de la conquête ottomane de la ville. Parmi les lieux de cultes musulmans seuls trois mosquées anciennes de la ville fut épargnées par la colonisation française telles que la mosquée de Sidi Bou Merouane construite en 1033 durant le règne des Zirides puis transformée en hôpital et en église par les français, la mosquée Salah Bey construite en 1791 dont l'originalité demeure l'architecture réunissant les deux rites malékite et hanafite avec les deux minarets. La mosquée de Sidi Brahim quant à elle fut fondée en 1768 située en périphérie de la ville. Il subsistait également une ancienne mosquée fondée par les réfugiés andalous du XVe siècle nommée la mosquée des Grenadiers détruite par les français en 1856 et la mosquée d'Abi Reffis détruite également durant la même période.\n\nDe plus la ville contient de nombreux mausolées de saints et érudits musulmans faisant l'objet de visite tels que celui d'Abu Merouane, Sidi Brahim Ben Toumi, Sebâa Rgoud, Sidi Nour, Lala Rhaïla, Lala Bouna, Qbar Ben Taïeb, Sidi Ahmed Lemqati, Sidi Hmaïda ou encore de Sidi Rabah.

          "content": "## By plane\n36.82297.80951 Annaba Rabah Bitat airport.    (updated Feb 2023) mostly provides domestic connections to Algiers and Oran. It also has international services to Paris (both Charles de Gaulle and Orly), and Istanbul. However, these flights aren't frequent and one should check the Air Algérie timetable when planning a trip.\n\n## By sea\nThere should be a ferry service from Marseille to Annaba operated by Algérie Ferries, but it is not running as of March 2022, presumably due to COVID-19.\n\n## By train\nThe national railway company SNTF[dead link] has daily services from Algiers and several other large cities. A daily night train leaves Algiers' Agha station at 18:40. Its price is DA1770 for a first class couchette bunk bed. Ticket sales start at 14:00 on the day of departure.\n36.89557.759122 Annaba railway station (Gare d'Annaba) (Just south of downtown).  (updated Feb 2023)\n\n## By road\nOne can also reach Annaba by road quite easily from most major Algerian cities. However, due to the road construction and traffic jams this is the least desirable option.\nThe 36.887967.747993 long distance shared taxi station (Station de taxi inter wilayas) (1 km south of the rail station).    (updated Feb 2023) provides connections to other provinces and cities, such as Constantine. In or around the station you can also find (unofficial) taxis to Tunis (DA3000). The trip to Tunis can take 6-7 hr including stops and border formalities.\n\n## Get around\nFrom the airport there is a regular bus shuttle service that runs to downtown Annaba.\nThe best way to get around Annaba is with taxis. They are the easiest, and most efficient way to get around, and they're readily available. There is also a network of bus routes that connects downtown Annaba with the rest of the city and surrounding suburbs.\n\n## See\nThe central parts of Annaba features both domestic and French colonial architecture, a stunning contrast of old and new. The central square Le Cours is filled with local cafés and ice cream parlors. Annaba has its own Kasbah, dating back to the 12th century. Enjoy narrow alleys and walkways and marvel at magnificent Ottoman architecture. The kasbah is located at the hill just east of Place d'Armes.\n36.8819447.7447221 Church of Saint Augustine of Hippo (Lela Bouna). Daily 9-11:30 14:30-16:30 (Su 11-11:30 14:30-16:30 and Fr only 14:30-16:30). One of the must sees of Annaba. It is on a hill not too far outside downtown, and it's a dominating sight. Taxis run regularly to and from the church. The church is a marvel, with stunning architecture and ancient Roman ruins right behind it. Saint Augustine's hand is kept inside the church.

(updated Feb 2023)\n\n## Do\nBeaches. A visit to Annaba is not complete without enjoying its beautiful Mediterranean coastline and one of its many beaches. During the day enjoy relaxing day at one of the beaches and at night head to \"La Corniche\". Located at the beach \"Chappui\" it comes alive at night with restaurants, clubs and people enjoying the crisp, cool refreshing air. A great end to any day.\nAmusement park (\"Les Allemande\" neighbourhood). A good time for families with young children.\n\n## Eat\nAnnaba has countless places to eat. Whether they be small family owned cafes, and restaurants to big fancy places there is a wide range of places to choose from. The fancier restaurants are almost exclusively at La Corniche, and by major beaches. However, there are cafes and restaurants all over town.\nWherever one goes in Algeria, trying the pizza sold at local cafes and restaurants is a must. Similar to the way Italians make pizza in Italy, it is delicious, and a welcome change to the usual round, heavy, topping filled pizza served in most western countries.\nOne thing Annaba specializes in is \"bourek\", an Algerian \"eggroll\". The east of Algeria, and more so Annaba, specializes in this delicacy.\nEnjoying a coffee and croissant at a cafe with the locals is always a good thing.\n\n## Drink\nLike any Algerian city. Annaba has a lot of traditional drinks and bars. Alcoholic drinks are pretty common and Algerian tea “Atay” is usually served in cafeterias.\n\n## Sleep\n36.9039427.7610591 Hôtel Seybouse International, 1, Boulevard du 1er Novembre 1954, ☏ +213 38 86 24 26.

(updated Jan 2017)\n36.9009657.7587213 Hotel Hoggar, La Placette Alexis Lambert (A few hundred meters north of the train station), ☏ +213 38459185. Hotel in city center with decent Wi-Fi and basic breakfast included. Single DA3600, double DA5000.    (updated Feb 2023)\n\n## Stay safe\nAs is common around Algeria, the city is lively during the day but quiets down fast after dark when most shops start closing. Combined with sparse street lighting this can give an impression of unsafety.\nWomen might not feel at ease late in the evening, as any people outside will be almost exclusively male.\n\n## Go next\nThere are a number of places to visit that are around or close to Annaba.\nSeraidi: Seraidi is a small village up high in the mountains that surround Annaba. It's about 13 km from downtown. It's a great place to enjoy a day away from the hustle and bustle of the city and escape enjoying the tranquility and clean, crisp air. There is a famous hotel there known to the locals as \"Hotel Al-Hawa\", literally \"hotel of the wind\". It is called that because it's so high up that it breaks the clouds and offers a great place to stay and has amazing views. On a clear day one can see the amazing views of the coastline and natural beaches below. On a cloudy day there is nothing but clouds. It's a great place to see the sunrise or sunset.\nEl Caala: El Caala is a small town about an hour and a half drive east of Annaba. It's on the road to Tunisia so it is very service oriented. There are many hotels, clubs, restaurants to enjoy. The beach of course, and many souvenirs one can get from there. Not far from El Caala there is \"La Vielle Calle\" or \"Old Caala\". There is a wonderful beach there and ruins of a French fort which are beautiful. La Vielle Calle is about 30-45 minutes away.\nTunisia: Annaba is in the east of Algeria, not far from the Tunisian border. The roads leading to Tunisia from Annaba are very well serviced and have numerous service oriented places on the way, such as restaurants, hotels and gas stations.",

          "content": "Skikda (Arabic: سكيكدة; formerly Philippeville from 1838 to 1962 and Rusicade in ancient times) is a city in northeastern Algeria and a port on the Mediterranean. It is the capital of Skikda Province and Skikda District.\n\nHistory\nThe Phoenicians and Carthaginians established a trading post and fort named RŠKD (𐤓𐤔𐤊‬𐤃‬, \"Jug Cape\") after Skikda's nearby cape. Falling under Roman hegemony after the Punic Wars, the name was Latinized as Rusicade or Rusiccade. Rusicade contained the largest Roman theatre in Algeria, dating to the reign of Hadrian.\nIn late antiquity, the port was destroyed during the Vandals' invasion of 530. The Byzantines reconquered the region in 533 and 534, but left large areas under Berber control. The town was overrun by the Umayyad Caliphate at the end of the 7th century.\nPresent-day Skikda was founded by French governor Sylvain Charles Valée in 1838 under the name Philippeville, honoring the French king at the time. The French were in the process of annexing Algeria and developed Philippeville as a port for Constantine, Algeria's third-largest city. The two cities were connected by rail. The harbour works, with every vessel in port, was destroyed by a storm in 1878; a larger harbour was then built. On 10 October 1883, there was an earthquake in Philippeville.\nTowards the end of World War II, a UNRRA refugee camp name Camp Jeanne d'Arc was established near the city. On 25 January 1945, 200 Jews holding citizenship from countries in North and South America were sent from the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp to Switzerland as part of a prisoner exchange group. They were later sent to the UNRRA camp in Skikda.\n\nBattle of Philippeville\nAn attack by the FLN in 1955 during the war of Independence left around 123 civilians dead, mainly French and those suspected of collaboration. Angered over the massacre of civilians, including women, seniors, and babies, the French escalated their offensive against the FLN. Reprisals by French forces may have killed between 1,200 (according to French sources,) and 12,000 civilians (according to the FLN.)\n\n1989 shipping disaster\nThe city has a commercial harbour with a gas and oil terminal. On 15 February 1989 the Dutch tanker the MV Maassluis was anchored just outside the port, waiting to dock the next day at the terminal, when extreme weather broke out. The ship's anchors did not hold and the ship smashed on the pier-head of the port. The disaster killed 27 of the 29 people on board.\n\nModern Skikda\nThe city has a population of over 250,000 inhabitant. Natural gas, oil refining, and petrochemical industries were developed in the 1970s and pipelines have been built for their transportation. The city hall (a neo-moorish style palace) and the railroad station were designed by Le Corbusier.\nThe official city flag colours are blue and white, reflecting the colours of the Mediterranean. The current postal code is 21000. Skikda has the third largest commercial port in Algeria after Algiers and Oran. It has also a petrochemical terminal port and a smaller fishing port in Stora, and there are many beaches along the natural Mediterranean coastline. There is also a closed airport near the petrochemical complex.\n\nGeography\nSkikda lies on the coast of the Gulf of Stora, part of the Mediterranean Sea. The landscape is hilly and forested, with high ridges on both the western and eastern sides of the city.\n\nClimate\nSkikda has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa), with cool, wet winters and very warm, dry summers.\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, Skikda is known for its seaport. It was described, in 1911, by Baedeker as having \"the youngest Algerian seaport.\"\nOn 19 January 2004, a fire and explosion at the Skikda LNG facility killed 29 people and caused $940,000,000 worth of damage.  The accident incapacitated three LNG trains and impacted approximately 2% of the world's liquefaction capacity. The explosion was preceded by the ingestion of a sizable leak of cold hydrocarbon into the boiler of the westernmost LNG line. This caused the boiler to explode. According to a 2018 report by Marsh McLennan on the 100 largest losses in the hydrocarbon industry, the Skikda explosion is the second most damaging gas processing incident since 1974.\n\nEducation\nThe University of Skikda is the main educational institution in the city and the province, with two campuses located in Azabba and Al-Hadaiq, attracting students from local, national, and international backgrounds. It offers a range of programs, including specialized courses in petrochemical engineering, which are key to the region's industrial development. The university plays a significant role in preparing students for careers in various fields, contributing to Skikda as a growing industrial and logistics city.\n\nSport\nFootball\nSkikda, with football being the most popular. The city's top club, JSM Skikda, represents Skikda in national competitions and has the largest supporters base in the province. The team plays at the Skikda Stadium of 20 August 1955. In addition to JSM Skikda, there are other clubs and football academies competing in inter-regional leagues.\n\nHandball\nHandball is also a prominent sport in Skikda, with JS Esperance de Skikda being a dominant club that represent the city and province in the national league. The club is well-known for its success, having won numerous national and international titles and currently playing in the top tier.\n\nTransportation\nThe main road from Skikda is the N3 to El Arrouch, Constantine, Batna, Biskra and Touggourt. Smaller local roads lead to the towns of Stora (to the northwest along the coast), Beni Bechir (to the south), Bissy and Azzaba (to the southeast), and El Mersa and Chetaibi (to the east).\nSkikda is the terminus of the Algiers-Skikda line – one of the SNTF mainline railroads, although most passenger and cargo services branch off in nearby Ramdane Djamel (towards the Ramdane Djamel-Annaba or Ramdane Djamel-Jijel lines before reaching Skikda).\n\nNotable people\nFadéla M'rabet (1935–2025), writer and feminist\nRose Celli (1895–1982), novelist, playwright, translator and poet\n\nPhoto Gallery\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nHuss, Werner (2006), \"Rusicade\", Brill's New Pauly Encyclopedia of the Ancient World, Leiden: Brill.\n\nExternal links\n\nSkikda District's Official Website",

الرئيسية في الجزائر.\nالطبيعة والمناخ:\n\nولاية ساحلية تتمتع بمناخ متوسطي (حار جاف صيفًا، معتدل ممطر شتاءً).\nتشتهر بالغابات والجبال مثل جبال القل وجبال تمالوس.\nتمتلك شواطئ جميلة مثل: شاطئ العربي بن مهيدي، عين دولة، سطورة.\n\nأصل التسمية\nنظرا لتعاقب عدة شعوب على الولاية وباعتبار المدة التي تضمنها اضطرت إلى إعطاء تسميات مختلفة للمنطقة في:\n\nالعهد الفينيقي: روسيكادا RUSICADA\nعند العرب: رأس النار RAS SKIKDA\nعهد الاحتلال الفرنسي: فليب فيل PHILIPPE VILLE\n\nجغرافيا\nتضاريس\nالمناخ\nيسود ولاية سكيكدة مناخ حوض البحر الأبيض المتوسط، والذي يتميز بشتاء دافئ ممطر، وبصيف حار جاف، فترة التساقط تبدأ من شهر أكتوبر إلى غاية شهر مارس.\n\nفترة الاعتدال والجفاف تبدأ من شهر أفريل إلى غاية شهر سبتمبر، تتلقى الولاية كمية معتبرة من الأمطار إذ تقدر نسبة التساقط السنوي 730 ملم.\n\nالموقع\nتقع الولاية شرق الشريط الساحلي الجزائري علي امتداد 130 كلم تقريبا وهي محصورة بين البحر الأبيض المتوسط وولاية عنابة، ولاية قسنطينة، ولاية قالمة وولاية جيجل، وإلى الغرب منها تقع قرية أغبال. تُقدر مساحتها بـ 4137.68 كلم² فيما يتجاوز عدد سكانها 800000 نسمة .\n\nتاريخ\nالعهد الفينيقي\nيعود تاريخها إلى العهد الفينيقي عندما قام الفينيقيون ما بين القرنين ال11 و 12 ق.م بتأسيس عدد من المستعمرات المرفئية التجارية في المنطقة مثل تصفتصف (الصفصاف) نسبة لأشجار الصفصاف، أستورا (ستورا)، وسكيكدة التي كانت تعرف عند الفينيقيين باسم روسيكاد (رأس-المنارة) وذلك لأنهم كانوا يشعلون النار ليلا فوق رأس الجبل ليهدوا السفن إلى ميناء أستورا نسبة للألهة (عشتروت) والذي يقع على بعد 3كم غرب روسيكاد وكانت أستورا ميناء روسيكاد الرئيسي لأن مياهه هادئة دائما ومحمي من الرياح الشمالية الغربية العاصفة بالمنطقة مما شجع على أن تكون ميناء لها.\n\nالعهد النوميدي\nثم جاء العهد النوميدي (من القرن 3ق.م إلى القرن 1ق.م). فقد كانت سكيكدة عبارة عن قرية قليلة البنايات وظيفتها إشعال النار في المناطق العليا منها منطقة بوعباز وذلك لتمكين السفن من الرسو بالميناء. وكانت روسيكاد تطل على الخليج الذي أسماه الرومان (سينوس نوميديكوس) أو خليج نوميديا.\nبعد هزيمة قرطاجة في الحرب البونيقية الثانية(218-202 ق.م) أصبحت روسيكاد وأستورا من ممتلكات ماسينيسا ملك نوميديا فتطورت روسيكاد تطورا كبيرا خلال الفترة النوميدية فقد كانت تساهم في تحسين العلاقات التجارية بين الرومان ونوميديا حيث كانت تصدر اللحوم والزيتون والثمار إلى الرومان وكل مستعمراتهم.\n\nالعهد الروماني\nو بعد سقوط مملكة نوميديا عام 105 ق.م أصبحت روسيكاد وأستورا من المستعمرات الرومانية وكانت تسمى ب (كولونيا فينيريا روسيكادا) ودخلت روسيكاد في الكونفدرالية الرومانية التي ضمت المدن المهمة قيرتا (قسنطينة)، ميلاف ميلة وشولو القل وتحول اسم تصفتصف إلى (ثابسوس).\nقام الرومان بمد روسيكاد بشبكات من الطرق تمدها بعدد من المدن من أجل تسهيل نقل المنتجات الزراعية .\nفي سنة 45 ق.م وبعد انتصار “بوليوس” قيصر الروم على “موبي” وحليفه الملك النوميدي “يوبا الأول”، أستولى الرومان على القطر كله ما عدا جنوبه وسلمت مقاطعة المستعمرات الأربع أو ما تسمى فيدراليـــــــــة سيرتا (قسنطينة) وروسيكادا (سكيكدة) وشولو (القل) وميلاف (ميلة) إلى المغامر “سيتوس” حليف القائد المستعمر بين عامي 146 (تاريخ سقوط قرطاج) وعام 24 بعد الميلاد (تاريخ وفاة”تاكفريناس”القائد النوميدي). استولى الروم على كل الساحل من هيبون”عنابة”إلى “طنجة”.\nوقد كانت المدينة قوية وثرية في عهد الأباطرة الانطونيون 96-182م حيث بلغ عدد سكانها ال100،000 نسمة\n\nالعهد الوندالي\nو مع قدوم الوندال انتهت نهاية مأساوية وعانت المدينة كثيرا إلى أن هدمت عام 439م ودمّرت مرة أخرى عام 533م على يد آخر ملوك الوندال بعد انحطاطها وتدهورها. وفي القرن ال7 م دخل إليها العرب المسلمون وأسموها رأس سكيكدة.\n\nالعهد الإسلامي\nو في صدر الإسلام تم فتح بلاد المغرب ومنه نشر الإسلام وذلك عن طريق حملات متتابعة وكانت جد صعبة وذلك لصعوبة المسالك وجغرافيـــة المنطقة،و كذلك رفض السكان الأصليين للمنطقة الغرباء الدين الجديد، فكانت حملة عقبة بن نافع عام 642م (21هـ) وكان ذلك أثناء خلافة الفاروق عمر بن الخطاب، ثم جاء ابن سيراج والي مصر في عهد خلافة عثمان بن عفان حيث استأنف الفتح فوصل تونس وانتصر على الروم وقضى على “سبيطلة” وكان ذلك عام 648 م (28 هـ) ثم انسحب إلى مصر فعاد البيزنطيون إليها وفي خلافة معاوية جاءت حملة بن خديج على إفريقيا عام 666 م (45هـ) فانتصر وكانت نتيجتها تسبقها الانسحاب بعد النصر.\nبدأ الفتح الجدّي لإفريقيا بتأسيس عقبة مدينة القيروان عام 670 م (50هـ) وتم على يد عظماء منهم عقبة وزهير وحسان وموسى بن نصير عــام (804م) (85هـ).\n\nالإحتلال الفرنسي\nإن تاريخ منطقة سكيكدة مرتبط ارتباطا وثيقا بمنطقة المغرب العربي والتي لم تتميز إلا بالاحتلال الفرنسي عندما انطلق الجنرال “نيقريي”يوم 07 أفريل 1838 من قسنطينة على رأس جيشه وفي 09 أفريل وصل هذا الجيش إلى حوض رمضان جمال وبالضبط منطقة “كاندديس” أين استقر بها الجيش.\nلقد صادف وجود الجيش الفرنسي بتراب الولاية مقاومة عنيفة من طرف السكان والقبائل خاصة قبائل بني تفوت، بني مهنة، بني إسحاق، بني صالح وأولاد الحاج وبني والبان.\nكان المستعمر يعتقد المنطقة (سكيكدة) مجرد آثار أو بقايا من العهد الروماني، وبالتالي بدأ في عملية التجديد حيث قام ببناء مدنية استعمارية، وبعد ذلك ربطها بطرق برية، ومن ثم حدد المرفأ، واستقطب الأوروبيون في سنة 1870.\nكان للولاية فضل كبير في نجاح ثورة التحرير وذلك من خلال أحداث 20 أوث 1955 أين عرف فليب فيل « Philippe ville » مصرعه، وبقيت صامدة حتى نالت الاستقلال كباقي ولايات الوطن.\n\nالأهمية\nتعتبر نقطة التدفق لكل المبادلات التجارية القادمة من المدن المجاورة وكذلك هي محور تجاري بين الجوانب الأربعة «الشرق، الغرب، الشمال والجنوب» وهي أيضا مركز اتصال بين داخل المنطقة والبحر ومدينة سكيكدة شرقا، وهذا عبر مختلف فترات الاحتلال التي تزامنت عليها، بفضل مينائها (كثيرا ما يخلط اسمه باسم ميناء سطورة) الذي يتميز بخصوصية وجوده في المركز الروماني سينوس نوميديكوس (Sinus Numidicus) في خليج نوميديا وهو واحد من الخلجان الأكثر أهمية في شمال أفريقيا، بين رأس بوقارون في الغرب ورأس الحديد في الشرق.\n\nتعتبر مدينة سكيكدة من أهم المدن الجزائرية باعتبارها قطب سياحي واقتصادي هام.\nيمتد الشريط الساحلي لولاية سكيكدة على مسافة 140 كم وهو الأطول على المستوى الوطني، تميزه الخلجان خاصة خليج سطورة والقل، وفي مقابل ذلك وجود غابات موازية للشواطئ وهو ما يجعل السياحة الشاطئية أكثر الأنواع السياحية ازدهارا.\nتحتفل مدينة سكيكدة سنويا بعيد الفراولة وغالبا ما يقع العيد أواخر شهر ماي.\nمدينة سكيكدة مدينة جزائرية يفوق عدد سكانها 300 ألف نسمة.\n\nمن أحياء مدينة سكيكدة\nالآثار\nومن آثار الرومان في سكيكدة الفوروم الروماني المشيد في مركز مدينة روسيكاد وكذلك جسور الطريق العالي لستورا التي كانت جسور رومانية منشأة بصخور كبيرة ولكن للأسف قامت بلدية المدينة بتغطيتها بالبلاط في بداية الثمانينات. وقد بنيت بنايات عدة حديثة فوق أسس معابد الآلهة الرومانية فينوس، جوبيتر وأبولو للأسف الشديد. أما المسرح الروماني القديم في روسيكاد فقد كان يسع لـ 6000 آلاف متفرج الذي يدل على التوسع الكبير للمدينة والذي يعتبر من أوسع المسارح الرومانية في شمال أفريقيا والمغرب العربي، ويقال أنه كان أكبر مسرح روماني في أفريقيا.\nانطلاقا من القرن السابع ووصول المسلمين إلى منطقة المغرب تعربت المنطقة، وكانت اللغة العربية سهلة التعلم. والاسم الحالي لرسيكاد يستمد أصوله من العربية، حيث تحول نطقه من sucaicada إلى ras skikda أي رأس سكيكدة لتحديد النقطة الأكثر علوا شرق المدينة، ولقد تعرض لها بالذكر الكثير من المؤرخين كالبكري والإدريسي، وخلال دخول العثمانيين دخلت سكيكدة ضمن بيلك قسنطينة وعاصمتها قسنطينة\n\nسكيكدة إبان الاحتلال الفرنسي\nاحتلت المدينة سنة 1838 أي بعد ثماني سنوات من دخول فرنسا إلى الجزائر . حيث أطلق عليها اسم فيليب فيل (PHILIPPE VILLE).\nاحتضنت الثورة وكانت مركز هجومات الشمال القسنطيني في 20 أوت 1955\nحيث ارتكب الاستعمار بعدها جريمة شنعاء بدفن الأحياء بالملعب البلدي للمدينة حيث ما زالت البلدية تحتفظ بالجرارة في الملعب.\n\nالإقتصاد\nالصناعة\nالسياحة\nالصيد

          "content": "Skikda (/skik.da/) (en arabe : سكيكدة ; en berbère : ⵙⴽⵉⴽⴷⴰ), anciennement Rusicada à l'époque antique, puis Philippeville pendant la période coloniale française, est une commune algérienne située en bordure de la mer Méditerranée, à 471 km à l'est d'Alger, dans la wilaya de Skikda. Elle est le chef-lieu éponyme de la wilaya de Skikda et de la daïra de Skikda.\nLa population de la commune de Skikda s'élève, au dernier recensement de 2016 à 320 000 habitants pour l'ensemble de l'agglomération.\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nSkikda est située à 471 km à l'est de la capitale Alger, à 140 km à l'est de Jijel, à 80 km au nord-est de Constantine et à 100 km à l'ouest d'Annaba.\nLa commune de Skikda est située au nord de la wilaya de Skikda, sur le littoral maritime. Elle est bordée au nord par la mer Méditerranée et est attenante aux communes de Filfila (à l'est), d'El Hadaiek et Hamadi Krouma (au sud) et de Aïn Zouit (à l'ouest et au sud-ouest).\n\nLa commune couvre une superficie de 5 200 hectares. Les coordonnées géographiques de la commune au point central de son chef-lieu valent respectivement 36° 52′ 00″ Nord et 6° 54′ 00″ Est.\n\nRelief et hydrographie\nLa région de Skikda, de part et d'autre de la vallée du Saf-Saf jusqu'à Ain Bouziane, est localisée entre la presqu'île de Collo, dont le cap Bougaroun à l'ouest, la plaine de Guerbes, le cap de Fer et le massif de l'Edough à l'est, la chaîne numidique (prolongement des Babors), dont le djebel Sidi Driss, le col du Contour et la chaîne de Zerdeza, au sud, et enfin, le golfe de Numidia au Nord. Outre les dépressions de Saf-Saf, la plus importante, et celles de Tamalous et Azzaba, la wilaya de Skikda est une région montagneuse où l'altitude moyenne est de 300 m, avec cependant des pics dépassant les 1 000 m (djebel El Goufi, au-dessus de Collo, et djebel Sidi Driss, au-dessus de Beni Oulbane). Elle fait partie de l'Atlas tellien qui, à partir de l'Algérois vers l'Est du pays, se scinde en deux chaînes montagneuses parallèlement à la côte méditerranéenne : le bourrelet liminaire ancien du littoral et la chaîne du tertiaire, plus au sud, représentant la chaîne numidique qui prend naissance à Mila, à l'ouest (djebel M'cid Aïcha) et traverse la région de Guelma (djebel Maouna), après avoir servi de rempart entre les wilayas de Skikda et Constantine.\n\nPar ailleurs, l'étude géologique du sous-sol de cette région fait ressortir cinq types de structures lithologiques : un soubassement primaire du pré-permien constituant le bourrelet liminaire ancien de la presqu'île de Collo; des sables ferrugineux (rouges) de l'ère secondaire (Ben M'hidi, Ain Righa…), une couverture gréso-argileuse modérément plissée du Numidien de l'ère tertiaire (El Goufi, Sidi Driss et toute la chaîne numidique), des terrains éruptifs ou volcaniques récents du tertiaire et du quaternaire (Bougarouni, Filfila, Cap de Fer, Chetaïbi…) et, enfin, des terrains très récents de plaines alluviales du Saf-Saf, Zeramna, oued El Guebli, dans la dépression de Tamalous et oued El Kébir, dans la plaine de Guerbés.\nDu point de vue climatique, la région de Skikda est dominée par un climat dit de type méditerranéen caractérisé par un hiver doux et pluvieux et un été sec et chaud. Les précipitations moyennes annuelles enregistrées varient entre 800 et 1 200 mm de pluies, ce qui permet le développement d'une couverture végétale abondante se traduisant sur le terrain par la densité des forêts de chênes lièges et la biodiversité importante qui caractérise les écosystèmes terrestre, marin et d'eau douce (rivières, lacs…). Cette abondance de pluie explique également le vaste réseau hydrographique constitué par les cours d'eau permanents et alimente les réserves en eau souterraine sous forme de nappes phréatiques.\n\nToponymie\nLe nom de la commune dérive de Rusicada, ancien nom phénicien de la ville.\nSkikda est également le nom de l'un des principaux promontoires de la ville donnant directement sur la mer. Rusicada, forme latinisée du toponyme punique de l'antique ville lieu choisi jadis par les Phéniciens pour y allumer un feu permanent destiné à guider leurs navires dans le golfe de Numidie (Sinus Numidicus), d'où l'appellation Rûs Ucadh (littéralement « le cap du feu » et, par extension sémantique, « le phare »).\nUne autre hypothèse laisse penser que le nom est composé de Rus et de sicade et signifierait « le cap des sauterelles ». Cette dénomination basée sur un nom sémitique composé de Rus a probablement servi de base au nom latinisé Rusicade.\nL'idée du phare est profondément ancrée dans l'inconscient collectif de la ville côtière.\nDurant la colonisation française, la ville fut débaptisée en Fort de France, puis Philippeville en hommage au roi Louis-Philippe. Elle conservera ce nom jusqu'en 1962.\n\nTransports\nLa ville dispose d'un important port commercial assurant entre autres des liaisons maritimes régulières de transport de voyageurs avec Marseille.\nEn plus du port commercial, la ville dispose d'un terminal pétrolier ainsi que d'un port de pêche (ce dernier est sis à Stora). Elle est également dotée d'une gare ferroviaire située près du port commercial où aboutissent les liaisons ferroviaires avec l'hinterland. La ville disposait également d'un aérodrome mais ce dernier a été fermé à la navigation aérienne pour des raisons de sécurité industrielle, puisque les pistes se trouvaient au sein de la zone pétrochimique.\nEn septembre 2008, la ville de Skikda s'est dotée d'un téléphérique reliant la cité Bouaabaz à la cité Bouyaala.\nLa ville dispose d'un réseau de transport routier (bus et taxi) dynamique qui assure la liaison avec les principales villes algériennes.\n\nHistoire\nOrigine de la population\nLa population de la ville de Skikda et de sa région littorale est d'origine très diversifiée sur son substrat berbère, même si elle reprend jusqu'à l'époque contemporaine les structures de l'organisation clanique villageoise des populations d'Afrique du Nord.\nOn sait très peu de chose sur le peuplement de la ville après sa destruction subite au VIe siècle de l'ère chrétienne, mais des sources arabes du Moyen Âge et notamment les géographes El-Bakri et El-Idrissi, attestent de l'occupation du port de Stora aux XIe et XIIe siècles. L'historien Ibn Khaldoun l'évoque au XIVe siècle en la désignant sous le nom de Sikda et, un siècle plus tard, Hassan Al-Wazzani, plus connu sous le nom de Léon l'Africain, la décrit comme Sukaykida en précisant qu'elle était réservée aux négociants de la république de Gênes.\nLa région est dominée par des tribus berbères, issues des anciennes populations numides, puniques puis des diverses strates romanisées avant l'arrivée des populations vandales au Ve siècle (Presqu'île de Collo jusqu'aux Toumiettes) mais aussi de tribus arabes au XIe siècle, dont la structure a permis l'absorption d'autres éléments venus d'Afrique noire et des îles méditerranéennes.\nSelon une théorie émise par Émile Masqueray, Il aurait existé également dans la région de Skikda un foyer de peuplement celtique autour de l'antique ville de Celtianis près de Beni Oulbane. Les souches originelles de ce qui allait composer actuellement la population de Skikda et sa région, sont répertoriées notamment dans les rapports d'enquêtes et les chroniques que réalisés par Laurent-Charles Féraud pour l'armée coloniale française et publiés dans le no 110 de la Revue africaine, en 1875.\nDans la région de Skikda (le sahel de Skikda ou de Phillipeville comptait donc à cette époque à peu près dans le massif de Phillipeville 5 360 arabes pour 14 820 berbères (page 450), ainsi selon l'étude française officielle en question (Recherches sur les tribus de l'Afrique septentrionale plus particulièrement de l'Algérie).\nLes tribus arabes ethniques en 1851 selon le capitaine et scientifique Ernest Carette à Skikda :\n\nBeni Ouelban ;\nEulma ;\nOuichaouia du Filfila ;\nRedjeta.\nTribus indécises :\n\nselon Carette et Ibn Khaldoun, une fraction des Banu Mehena sont arabes ;\nOulad djebara considérés comme arabes mais sûrement berbères (Ernest Carette).\nLes tribus berbères ethniques en 1851 selon le capitaine et scientifique E. Carette à Skikda :\n\nMedjàdja ;\nBanu Mehena (plusieurs fractions kabyles mêlées avec des arabes) :\nHichaoua,\nTâabna,\nZerdeza,\nEl-Arouch,\nElma,\nBeni-Salah,\nMedjasda,\nMerdjia,\nHaddada,\nChekatktat,\nOuled-Oudina,\nOuled-Nouar,\nHadjadjemïa,\nDemenia,\nOuled-Mazouni,\nOuled-Ah'med,\nBeni-Djalama,\nMsabah,\nZerdera ;\nTehabena ;\nZeramna ou jeramna tribu d'origine arabe ;\nOulad Atia (selon Ibn Khaldoun ils serrai une branche des Hilal) ;\nOulad el-Hadj ;\nAchéch ;\nBanu Ishak ;\nBanu Salah ;\nOulad Aisha ;\nOulad Atia (Colo) ideme ;\nBeni Fergan ;\nBeni Merwan ;\nSlais ;\nMchat.\nCette liste ne saurait être exhaustive, notamment en raison des différentes expropriations, du démantèlement de l'organisation tribale, des recompositions sociales introduites au sein des populations autochtones, ainsi que de l'exil et l'expatriement de pans entiers de la société qui ont suivi les différentes périodes d'occupation qu'a connues Skikda, d'autant plus que le recoupement des témoignages consignés dans les différents rapports des chroniqueurs se font par voie orale. Par ailleurs, relativement à d'autres sources, en sa qualité de région du nord constantinois, Skikda appartient à l'extrémité de ce que des géographes, tels que Paul Vidal de La Blache, Jean Despois et René Raynal appellent la Kabylie orientale.].\n\nPréhistoire\nCette période sur laquelle on connaît très peu de choses se compose de deux âges : la préhistoire et la protohistoire. Le premier âge se traduit par l'existence d'un ensemble de vestiges qui ont été recensés dans les localités de Tamalous et de Kerkera, dans la zone ouest du bas massif, ainsi qu'à Souk Lihoud, près de Bounaghra, dans la presqu'île de Collo. Ces vestiges sont représentés par des monuments mégalithiques importants. Il s'agit, en l'occurrence, de dolmens, monuments datant de l'ère néolithique (20 000 ans av. J.-C.). On y trouve également des grottes anciennes. Quant au second âge, la protohistoire, qui représente en fait l'aube ou le début de l'ère historique, elle a été décrite par l'historien français: Stéphane Gsell (1864-1932) qui lie cette période à une peuplade qui avait élu domicile dans cette région et que des sources latines auxquelles il a été fait référence appelaient les Gutuma. II s'agit en fait des Kutama, une tribu berbère dont les limites territoriales occupaient, selon le sociologue et historien: Ibn Khaldoun, l'axe Béjaïa, Annaba et Baghaï, dans les Aurès.\n\nAntiquité\nPériode phénicienne\nAncien comptoir phénicien fondé durant l'extension de la civilisation des Phéniciens au-delà de leurs frontières originelles. Sa création se situe à l'arrivée de ces derniers sur les côtes de l'océan Atlantique vers 2 000 ans av. J.-C.\nEntre les XIIe et XIe siècles avant notre ère, virent le jour les comptoirs de Rusucade (Skikda), Chullu (Collo), Tsaf-Tsaf et Astora (Stora), tous quatre faisant partie de l'actuelle wilaya de Skikda. Le comptoir de Tsaf-Tsaf fut érigé à proximité de l'ancienne embouchure de l'actuel Oued Zeramna, non loin de l'actuelle gare ferroviaire et de la place du 1er novembre, au pied de cet autre comptoir qu'est Rusucade, appellation phénicienne composée de deux mots « Rus » désignant le cap, et « Ucade » (prononcé Oucade) signifiant feu, le tout donnant ainsi une traduction littérale de « cap du feu ».\nCette signification étymologique se retrouve également dans deux autres villes côtières auxquelles les Phéniciens donnèrent les noms de Rusazir (Azeffoun) et Rusuccum (Dellys). Les phares n'existant pas encore, le premier ayant été édifié par les Grecs d'Alexandrie, en Égypte, sur l'Île de Pharos sous le règne de Ptolémée II Philadelphe au IIIe siècle avant notre ère, les Phéniciens allumaient chaque soir un brasier sur le promontoire de Rusucade afin de diriger vers Astora les navires venant de l'Est. II faut dire que du fait de sa position altitudinale avantageuse car plus élevée que les autres promontoires environnants, Rusucade était l'emplacement idéal pour accueillir le phare.\nD'ailleurs, à ce propos, notons qu'en berbère \"Askad\" désigne le belvédère et Skikda signifierait donc le belvédère d'où l'on peut admirer la beauté de la baie de Stora. Pour sa part, Tsaf-Tsaf désigne également le nom de l'antique Zeramna. Tout cours d'eau bordé de saules est appelé par les Phéniciens Tsaf-Tsaf (Saf-Saf en arabe). À cette époque (antiquité), beaucoup plus loin en amont, et la plaine alluviale actuelle située entre Merdj Eddib et Ben M'hidi n'existait pas encore, un lagon ainsi que d'immenses marécages que finira par combler la rivière venant des Zerdezas en représentaient le paysage originel.\nEn outre, à 3 km à l'ouest de Rusucade est localisé le comptoir de Astora dont le mot tire son origine de la racine sémitique « STR » qui signifie « protéger ». Astora désigne également la déesse phénicienne de l'amour et de la beauté, déesse considérée par la même occasion protectrice des navigateurs. Il est, par ailleurs, à signaler que le trait particulier de Astora, qui est aussi un golfe montrant donc une eau toujours calme, renforce la croyance des navigateurs sur le caractère protecteur de Astora, car les protégeant, ainsi que le port, des vents violents de direction nord-ouest soufflant sur la région.\nRusucade connut un développement important sur tous les plans à telle enseigne qu'il devint le centre névralgique des activités commerciales autour duquel perlaient notamment Chullu et Tsaf-Tsaf. Actuellement, il ne reste plus de cette grande ville phénicienne que quelques vestiges funéraires localisés sur les hauteurs de Stora, à travers les nécropoles de Stora, le djebel de Skikda, antique Rusucade, à proximité du siège de la wilaya, dans un site dominant le golfe.\nDurant cette phase d'occupation de Rusucade, les Phéniciens introduisirent l'usage du bronze et du fer ainsi que celui de leurs nombres et de leur alphabet. Ils enseignèrent également aux autochtones de meilleurs procédés de culture de la vigne et leur apprirent à greffer l'oléastre pour donner l'olivier.\n\nPériode numide\nEn 202 av. J.-C., l'armée du général carthaginois Hannibal est vaincue lors de la bataille de Zama (Tunisie actuelle) dans de violents affrontements qui l'ont opposé à l'alliance scellée entre les Romains dirigés par Scipion l'Africain et la cavalerie numide menée par le chef des Numides Massyles, Massinissa. Tsaf-Tsaf, que les Romains transcrivent Thapsa ou Thapsus, ainsi qu'Astora et Rusucade font partie du royaume numide gouverné par Massinissa et qui s'étend de Vaga (Béja en Tunisie) à la Mulucha (actuelle Moulouya), rivière frontalière avec la Maurétanie turgitane (le Maroc actuel). La capitale de ce royaume est Cirta, qu'on prononce Qurta (quourta), mot d'origine punique signifiant la ville.\nDurant cette période, Rusucade connut un niveau de développement des plus importants. À cet effet, elle contribua de façon notable à la promotion et l'amélioration des relations commerciales avec le siège principal des Romains, à savoir la grande ville de Rome. Cette coopération bilatérale permit à Cirta de devenir le point nodal de la production agricole qui a atteint un degré d'évolution tel que la capitale du royaume numide constitua pour les Romains le principal centre d'approvisionnement en viandes, huiles, olives et autres denrées alimentaires pour toutes leurs colonies et leur territoire situes à l'intérieur des plaines. Cependant, malgré cette embellie commerciale, la période numide fut caractérisée par une faiblesse clans le réseau routier, problème d'ailleurs que les Romains rencontrèrent lors de l'approvisionnement de leurs colonies situées à l'intérieur des terres qui étaient desservies par de simples chemins de terre non aménagés à travers monts et collines. C'est ce qui poussa les Romains, lors de leur occupation, à développer tout un réseau de maillages routiers, notamment à Rusucade. Seulement, cette coopération numidoromaine est loin d'être un havre de paix, car les intentions belliqueuses des Romains commencèrent à poindre à l'horizon, notamment après la destruction de Carthage en 146 av. J.-C., qui vit les Romains s'intéresser de près au royaume numide afin d'empêcher et de mettre un terme à l'expansion et l'essor de ce dernier.\n\nPériode romaine\nLa grandeur du royaume numide a aiguisé les velléités hégémonistes autour du trône. En 105 av. J.-C., Jugurtha fut arrêté et Cirta devenait la capitale de la nouvelle confédération romaine qui intégra en son sein des villes importantes, à l'image de Colic, Mila et Skikda. Rusucade, devenue Rusicade, et Astora devinrent des colonies romaines et connurent durant cette période un développement économique et commercial important. Conséquence de cette occupation, Rusicade vit son réseau routier se développer à une vitesse vertigineuse et ce, pour drainer les multiples échanges commerciaux qui se font avec les villes alentour et dont Rusicade fut la plaque tournante d'un commerce florissant. Parmi ces routes celle qui relie Cirta au port de Rusicade; la route nord-ouest qui longe le littoral en traversant l'oued Annab et qui rejoint la ville d'Hippone (Annaba); la route en direction de l'est qui plonge dans les villes de l'intérieur pour se bifurquer selon deux autres directions: l'une menant vers Guelma et l'autre menant vers le sud pour atteindre Mila. Plus tard, le général Pompée, rival de Jules César dans la lutte pour le pouvoir, est vaincu avec son allié Juba Ier, roi de Numidie, à Thapsus de l'Afriqua (Tunisie actuelle) en 46 av. J.-C. Ce dernier se donna la mort et son fils Juba II, élevé dans la cour de Rome, fut proclamé roi de Maurétanie à Iol Caesarea (Cherchell actuelle) vers 25 av. J.-C. et marié à Cléopâtre Séléné, fille d'Antoine et de la reine Cléopâtre d'Égypte, à la gloire de laquelle son mari érigeât le monument le « Tombeau de la chrétienne ». Nonobstant les origines numidiennes du roi, ce royaume fut contrôlé par les Romains.\nAprès donc la victoire de César en 47 av. J.-C., la ville de Rusicade a connu de nombreuses modifications à travers notamment l'extension de la zone portuaire où furent construits de nombreux hangars dans le but de répondre aux besoins sans cesse croissants des activités et des échanges commerciaux.\nPar ailleurs, un siècle après l'occupation romaine, Rusicade devint un municipe se gouvernant selon ses propres lois (conformément à la définition même du terme Municipe), mais s'acquittant néanmoins de l'impôt en nature (ou impôt de l'Annone) à destination de Rome. Les habitants des Municipes deviennent progressivement des citoyens à part entière et sont dirigés par un magistrat imposé (praefectus) et des magistrats librement choisis.\nL'occupation romaine durant plusieurs siècles ne fut pas sans laisser de traces. En effet, de nombreux édifices imposants furent érigés çà et là et dont quelques-uns sont encore visibles à travers des vestiges sauvegardés dans un musée.\nÀ l'origine, la ville de Rusicade était dédiée à l'Astora des Romains, la déesse Vénus, d'où son nom de « Colonia Veneria Rusicade » ou « colonie de Rusicade dédiée à Vénus ». L'âge d'or de Rusicade correspond au règne des Antonins, au IIe siècle apr. J.-C., plus exactement entre 182 et 96 apr. J.-C. La ville connut une richesse et une opulence des plus enviables et abritait une population estimée à l'époque à 100 000 âmes, les dimensions du théâtre romain en faisant foi vu qu'il pouvait accueillir 30 000 spectateurs. Il est à noter que le plan des rues de la ville coloniale française Philippeville est superposable à celui de la ville romaine de Rusicade, à une exception près, le Zeramna a cédé la place à la rue Nationale, actuelle rue Didouche Mourad, après avoir été détourné de son lit par les autorités françaises, durant la colonisation, vers le Saf-Saf par le biais d'un canal.\nDans toute ville romaine, il y a une rue principale appelée le « Cardo maximus » et traversée en son centre par le « Decumanus ». Pour Rusicade, le Cardo maximus à une direction nord-sud de part et d'autre du lit du Tsaf-Tsaf ou Thapsus (actuel Zeramna et plus précisément la rue Didouche Mourad) et le Decumanus montre une direction est-ouest et correspond à l'actuelle rue Boudjemâa Lebardi qui traverse la rue Nationale vers le siège de la direction de l'Éducation.\nPar ailleurs, d'autres édifices sont également témoins de l'occupation romaine, dont notamment :\n\nle forum romain, qui a été bâti au centre de la ville de Rusicade et qui servait de lieu de rencontres où se déroulaient moult activités socio-politico-culturelles. C'était un lieu d'expression. L'actuelle esplanade de la Liberté en est le témoin ;\nles ponts de la route supérieure de Stora qui étaient des ponts romains construits en gros appareils réguliers (gros blocs de pierre réguliers) que l'APC a malheureusement couverts de ciment au début des années 1980 ;\nles fondations du théâtre municipal sont celles du temple de Vénus, épaisses substructures en petit appareil régulier, couverts également de ciment au début des années 1990 ;\nles fondations du palais de justice correspondent à celles du temple de la Victoire ;\nles fondations de l'hospice des vieillards sont celles des temples d'Hélios (dieu du soleil) et de Mithra ;\nles fondations de l'hôpital et l'hôtel Es-Salem correspondent à celles de Jupiter Apennin et de Bellone (déesse de la guerre).\n\nPériode vandale\nDurant longtemps, Rusicade préserva sa réputation de ville-phare et de centre commercial très important par où transitent de nombreux navires venant de toutes les contrées avoisinantes et lointaines et servit pendant une longue période, avec Stora, de plaque tournante économique dans l'approvisionnement et les échanges commerciaux entre Rome et ses colonies en Afrique du Nord. Mais cette embellie économique et cette relative accalmie connurent une fin tragique avec l'arrivée des Vandales sur les côtes de l'Afrique du Nord.\nEn 439, à la suite d'une attaque surprise, les Romains furent défaits à Carthage qui tomba entre les mains des Vandales. C'était le début d'une nouvelle ère pour Rusicade, nouvelle mais néanmoins funeste, car l'occupation vandale fut des plus destructrices. C'était le commencement de la fin. En fait, avec l'arrivée des Vandales rien n'a changé, en bien cela s'entend, car ils n'apportèrent aucune amélioration à leurs nouvelles colonies, en général, et à Rusicade, en particulier. Ils ont maintenu en place tous les systèmes de gouvernance et économiques à l'exception du mode de gestion immobilière qui se traduisait notamment par l'expropriation violente des terres fertiles et cultivables. Les actes de répression étaient le lot quotidien des habitants. L'anarchie, la décadence et la dégradation des conditions de vie n'augurent rien de bon et la création de sites militaires était le jeu prisé des Vandales, ce fut d'ailleurs le seul domaine dans lequel ils excellaient. II fut ainsi jusqu'à la destruction de Rusicade, fait du dernier roi vandale fuyant le général byzantin Bélisaire et ce, en 533.\nAu terme de la période romaine et vandale, et à la suite des bouleversements qui s'ensuivirent, la région de Rusicade connut de nombreuses tentatives de recouvrement de la souveraineté berbère qui était sous la domination byzantine.\n\nMoyen Âge et période arabo-musulmane\nÀ partir du VIIe siècle, la région fait partie de l'Ifriqiya, elle est tour à tour omeyyade, abbasside, fihride, muhallabide[réf. nécessaire], aghlabide, fatimide, ziride, hafside et ottomane.\nL'arrière-pays Skikdi connaît une islamisation à partir de Mila sous le gouverneur omeyyade Abou al-Mouhajir Dinar 674-681. La chute de Carthage aux mains des Arabes (omeyyades), arrive vers 698 sous Hassan ibn Numam al-Ghassani, (692-703), Bone (Annaba) suit vers 699 la région côtière est touchée en même temps, Avec l'avènement de l'islam, la langue arabe est introduite et facilement assimilée car les autochtones maîtrisent déjà l'usage de la langue sémitique punique, parallèlement aux autres langues telles que le berbère et le latin.\nD'ailleurs, la nouvelle appellation de Rusicade tire ses origines de l'arabe, donnant Sucaïcada ou Ras Skikda. Les premiers chroniqueurs arabes, dont l'un des premiers à avoir écrit sur les conquêtes arabes lbn Abd El Hakam, rapportent l'appellation au toponyme de Taskikdit. Avec l'arrivée des Ottomans qui dominent longtemps Constantine et Collo, les régions montagneuses échappent plus ou moins et relativement à la domination turque, dont Skikda et Stora.\nLes tribus de la région appartenaient autrefois à la tribu berbère des Ketamas (Kutama) qui ont rallié et suivi le calife fatimide Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi al-Fatimi vers l’Égypte où ils fondent le Caire après avoir vaincu Abbassides et Aghlabides, l'histoire des tribus Bani Hilal et Bani Sulaym, mis à part ce qu'en a dit Ibn Khaldoun, n'est retenue dans la région que sous la forme de chants et de poèmes.\nSelon le géographe al-Idrissi dans la région entre l'ancienne Collo et Constantine qui correspond au territoire de la wilaya de Skikda, entre la mer et Constantine se trouvaient des populations arabes hilaliennes : « De Constantine au port d’al-Collo, 2 journées, en traversant une contrée fréquentée par les Arabes ». Plus loin l'auteur continue : « D’al-Collo à Constantine, on compte 2 journées, en se dirigeant vers le sud et en traversant un pays occupé par les Arabes »\n\nPériode coloniale\nLes ruines de la ville antique, détruite par les Vandales au Ve siècle de l'ère chrétienne, furent investies par les Français en janvier 1838 lors de la colonisation de l'Algérie peu après la chute de Constantine. Repoussées lors d'une première tentative par voie terrestre en provenance de Constantine, les troupes françaises étaient entrées par la baie de Stora, un ancien comptoir phénicien dont l'histoire remonte à 1000 av. J.-C., devenue plus tard le port de pêche de Skikda, et installèrent leur quartier général sur l'emplacement actuel de l'hôpital, situé en hauteur, pour faire face à la résistance armée des tribus des environs. La ville fut rebaptisée Fort de France du nom du navire qui permit le débarquement des Français dans la baie, puis Philippeville en hommage au roi Louis-Philippe. Elle conservera ce nom jusqu'en 1962.\nC'est en négociant avec les tribus hostiles des environs, notamment les puissantes confédérations guerrières des Béni Méhenna et des Béni Béchir, que les Français purent occuper, en premier lieu, une des deux rives de l'oued Saf-Saf (l'antique Thapsus) qui coupe les deux vallées sur lesquelles se trouve la ville actuelle. Les Français négocièrent également les hauteurs de Bouabbaz en échange de la construction de la Mosquée de Sid Ali el-Adib en 1840 sur l'autre versant de la ville faisant face au lieu. La mosquée de Sid-Ali el-Adib, du nom d'un saint d'origine syrienne venu de Béjaïa du nom de Sayyidi Ali al-Adib al-Qaysi, est aujourd'hui la plus ancienne mosquée de la ville.\nLors de son second voyage en Algérie, l'empereur Napoléon III fit escale à Philippeville le 28 mai 1865 ; il y fut accueilli par le maire et le sous-préfet Nouvion.\nEn 1911, au cours d'une grève de protestation des dockers du port de Philippeville, les ouvriers musulmans lèvent un drapeau turc et un autre, de couleur verte, frappé du croissant et de l'étoile qui est considéré comme l'un des ancêtres du drapeau algérien, pour exprimer leur solidarité et leur fidélité à l'Empire ottoman.\nLe 4 août 1914, le port de Skikda est violemment bombardé par un bâtiment de guerre de la marine allemande, le croiseur de bataille SMS Goeben qui arborait un pavillon russe pour faire diversion, dès qu'il fut en position de tir, il le remplace par le pavillon allemand. Les pertes françaises furent de 16 morts et de nombreux blessés.\nEn 1935, le réformateur religieux Abdelhamid Ben Badis visitant la ville y fut mal accueilli. Ce qui a donné naissance au mythe d'une ville dont les enfants auraient été maudits par le célèbre prédicateur.\nDurant les années 1920-1930, un prédicateur religieux errant du nom de Ben Aroua émit une série de prophéties sur l'avenir de la ville dont celles, demeurées célèbres dans la mémoire collective, relatives à la guerre et à l'indépendance, à un serpent métallique dont les origines se perdent dans les sables du désert et la tête dans la mer, allusion allégorique au pipeline qui relie les champs pétrolifères du Sahara au terminal pétro-chimique, ainsi qu'à la survenue d'une catastrophe de type apocalyptique dont ne seront rescapés que ceux qui se réfugieront sur les hauteurs du Djebel Messiouen situé non loin de la ville.\n\nSeconde Guerre mondiale\nEn 1942, les troupes alliées y débarquent, notamment sur les plages de Jeanne d'Arc (actuellement Larbi Ben M'hidi) où la carcasse rouillée d'un mini sous-marin gît toujours au niveau de la 7e plage. La ville est également la cible de bombardements aériens effectués par des avions-bombardiers italiens et allemands.\nLa venue des GI alliés suscite l'enthousiasme général des populations musulmanes de la ville. Le 25 juillet 1943, un incident entre un tirailleur sénégalais et des Algériens sert de prétexte à un massacre commis au niveau du quartier arabe (l'actuelle Souika) durant lequel des tirailleurs sénégalais tuent une trentaine de civils algériens. C'est grâce à l'intervention d'un colonel de l'armée anglaise que cesse le massacre dont les victimes sont inhumées en présence du maire de la ville, Cuttoli, et des principaux notables européens et musulmans.\nPhilippeville a été décorée, le 28 février 1950, de la croix de guerre 1939-1945 (France) avec étoile d'argent par Marcel-Edmond Naegelen, gouverneur général d'Algérie, en place à l'époque.\n\nGuerre d'Algérie\nAu cours de la guerre d'Algérie (1954-1962), Skikda fut le théâtre d'atroces massacres : le 20 août 1955, une série d'attaques menées par des unités de l'Armée de libération nationale (ALN), sous la responsabilité de Youcef Zighoud et de Lakhdar Bentobal a massacré des cibles européennes, parfois dans d'horribles souffrances. Des enfants, certains de moins de 3 ans, sont égorgés, ou fracassés contre les murs, les femmes sont violées. En tout on dénombre plus d'une centaine de morts ces massacres touchent aussi des notables musulmans au voisinage et dans la ville entraîne de terribles représailles de la part des milices armées constituées par le maire, des forces de commando-parachutistes et de bérets rouges de l'armée française dont l'école était située à Jeanne d'Arc (7 km de la ville) et des milices armées constituées d'extrémistes pieds-noirs.\nLes militaires tiraient à vue sur tous les hommes de 14 à 70 ans. Ceux qui ne furent pas sommairement exécutés sur place furent rassemblés et emmenés au stade municipal (aujourd'hui Stade du 20 août 1955) où ils furent massacrés et ensevelis dans des fosses communes recouvertes à la chaux vive tandis que des hameaux (notamment le Béni-Melek) subissaient des pilonnages massifs à l'artillerie et des bombardements aériens.\nLe militant anticolonialiste Daniel Guérin estimait le nombre des victimes algériennes dans la ville de Skikda à 2 000. Les recherches récentes évaluent le nombre des victimes du côté des insurgés pour l'ensemble du Constantinois entre trois et cinq mille morts.\n\nDepuis l'indépendance de l'Algérie\nEn 1962, la ville de Skikda connut un exode de la population européenne (pieds-noirs) vers la France. Durant les années 1950, mais plus particulièrement à partir des années 1960 et 1970, la ville connut un afflux massif de populations rurales (mais également celles en provenance d'autres régions aussi lointaines qu'Oran) à la recherche d'emplois dans le secteur tertiaire puis dans le domaine pétrolier; ce qui a eu pour effet de recomposer totalement les structures sociales et démographique de la ville. Le même phénomène s'accentua au cours des années 1990 durant lesquelles les populations fuyant l'insécurité, vinrent s'établir dans les grandes agglomérations urbaines.\n\nAdministration\nLa ville de Skikda, ex-Philippeville, avait été administrée par l'armée française de 1838 jusqu'en 1843.\nLe 9 février 1843, elle est érigée en Commune par arrêté du ministère de la Guerre.\nAprès l'indépendance de l'Algérie le 5 juillet 1962, Skikda est une sous-préfecture du département de Constantine. Elle devient un chef-lieu de wilaya (préfecture) à la suite du découpage territorial de 1974.\nLes municipalités en Algérie ont été administrées par des Assemblées populaires communales ou APC, qui subsistent encore. Cependant, ce mode d'organisation communale s'avére problématique et génère des dysfonctionnements. Par exemple, le budget alloué à la mairie de Skikda est souvent bloqué.\n\nLe 5 février 2020, Mohamed Bougueroua et son prédécesseur, Kamel Tabbouche, sont placés sous mandat de dépôt pour des faits de corruption.\n\nJumelages\nEn 2005, un accord a été signé avec l'Autorité palestinienne pour jumeler la ville de Skikda avec Jérusalem Est.\n\nÉconomie\nAutrefois région à forte vocation agricole et touristique, Skikda est devenue l'un des bastions de l'industrie pétrolière du pays puisqu'elle abrite une plateforme pétrochimique qui comprend deux raffineries de pétrole, deux centrales électriques, un terminal de gazoduc et un d'oléoduc, deux unités de liquéfaction de gaz et une unité chimique de polymères. Le tout s'étend sur une surface de plus de 1 500 hectares.\nEn 2004, la China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) a remporté un contrat d'un montant de 390 millions de dollars visant à reconstruire la raffinerie de Skikda.\n\nSports\nLa ville possède un club de football: la JSMS ou la Jeunesse Sportive du Médina Skikda, portant les couleurs noir et blanc. Elle fut l'une des meilleures équipes du championnat national dans les années 1960 -1970.\n\nCulture\nLa fête de la fraise est un événement annuel qui se tient au mois de mai pour célébrer l'une des spécialités de la région. Des danses folkloriques, des fantasias, des concours de pâtisseries et d'artisanat sont organisés à cette occasion. La ville, compte aussi des équipements culturels comme la maison de la culture : Aïssat Idir, au style architectural haussmannien et des bibliothèques.\n\nPatrimoine\nLa ville compte un patrimoine architectural important dont le plus impressionnant reste l'amphithéâtre romain, édifié au IIIe siècle de l'ère chrétienne, est situé en plein centre de la ville de Skikda (adjacent au lycée de jeunes filles En-Nahda). Sa capacité est plus importante que celle des amphithéâtres de Guelma et de Timgad. Skikda faisait partie des rares villes possédant sept salles de cinéma dès les années 1930 : l'Empire, l'Eden, le Rivoli, le Rialto, le Régent, le Colisée et le Lido ainsi qu'un grand casino à la plage qui porte le même nom. Le théâtre municipal est d'un style similaire, par certains de ses aspects, au style baroque et constitue l'une des curiosités de la ville. L'Hôtel de ville de style néo-mauresque, conçu par Le Corbusier. Il contient des tableaux de maîtres d'une très grande valeur.\nCette région est importante pour l'hivernage de l'avifaune d'une partie de l'Europe, patrimoine environnemental de la ville.\n\nPatrimoine préhistorique\nII ne subsiste de cette période que deux types de vestiges des grottes et des monuments mégalithiques représentés par des dolmens. Les grottes sont localisées à Tamalous et Kerkera, dans la presqu'île de Collo. Quant aux dolmens, ils sont répertoriés au niveau de Bounaghra, au lieu-dit Souk Lihoud, de Tamalous (où il en a été recensé 20) et de Kerkera (au nombre de 3). Le mystère entourant ces dolmens et leur rôle demeure entier. Mais des tentatives d'interprétation leur attribuent la fonction de nécropoles mégalithiques de l’ère préhistorique.\n\nPatrimoine antique\nDe l’antique et prospère Rusicade, il ne reste plus que, grossièrement, deux vestiges qui ont défié le temps et les hommes : le théâtre antique et la voûte romaine. Les autres formes sous lesquelles on retrouve ce qui représentait l’époque faste de la période romaine sont les ruines romaines et les substructures ainsi que les fondations d'édifices publics romains sur lesquels a été bâtie la nouvelle ville coloniale.\nLes différents sites abritant les ruines romaines sont nombreux. On peut citer les ruines romaines d'oued Bibi et oued Tanger, dans la commune de Aïn Zouit, entre Skikda et Collo celles de Paratianis, à Guerbès ou littoral de Djendel (daIra de Azzaba); celles de Culucinatis (près de la Marsa), de Celtiana, l'antique Beni Oulbane et, enfin, les ruines de Cobb et de Stora. De ces ruines ont été récupérées de très nombreuses pièces archéologiques qui ont alimenté les différents musées de la région, notamment le musée municipal de Skikda.\nLa voûte romaine est située à proximité du port de pêche de Stora. Ce vestige était en réalité une nymphée consacrée au culte de l'eau et comprenant un ensemble de vastes salles d'eau (citernes) creusées sous la falaise de l’Horloge. Cette construction servait au stockage de l'eau. Les citernes restaurées par les colons français, situées dans la partie basse de Stora et utilisées depuis l'occupation française, étaient d'une contenance de 3 000 m3 d'eau environ à l'époque romaine. La citerne se trouvant sous la voûte et qui recevait les eaux provenant de la fontaine située au-dessus est une merveille architecturale de la période romaine. Malgré les mutilations qu'elle a subies et qui ont éventré une large proportion de sa voûte, elle témoigne de son antique importance par ses dimensions 8 mètres de large sur 9 mètres de haut, avec une longueur qui ne devait pas être inférieure à 20 - 25 mètres. Des blocs de maçonnerie provenant de cette citerne existent encore sur le contrebas indiquant par là qu'elle s'est effondrée ou qu'elle a été démolie lors de l'établissement, durant l'époque coloniale, du chemin menant de Stora au petit phare, Parmi les autres ouvrages en dur destinés à l'eau, on peut citer les sept citernes romaines (seb'a ebiar) de Fort national, au sommet de la partie nord de Bouyala, qui sont encore utilisées de nos jours pour alimenter en eau les vieux quartiers de Skikda.\nLes substructures et fondations d'édifices publics romains. Le 7 octobre 1838, lorsque l'armée coloniale arriva à Skikda, elle découvrit les vestiges d'une immense ville antique, les ruines de Rusicade. Du fait de la résistance héroïque des Skikdis, sous la direction de Si Zaghdoud, les Français prirent la résolution de s'installer sur le site même de Rusicade et s'empressèrent de construire le mur d'enceinte et édifièrent de nouvelles maisons sur les restes des constructions antiques.\nLes cubes de granit de l'époque romaine furent réutilisés dans la majorité des assises des nouveaux édifices coloniaux. On peut d'ailleurs le constater de visu dans le quartier napolitain, dans le mur porteur extérieur du CEM El Khawarizmi et dans beaucoup d'autres quartiers de la ville coloniale. En outre, le tracé des rues du Skikda colonial correspond et se confond avec celui de l'antique Rusicade, à quelques exceptions près. Le Cardo maximus (principale rue des villes romaines) qui comprenait deux voies parallèles de part et d'autre d'un lit d'oued correspond à l'actuelle rue Didouche Mourad, et le Decumanus (occupant perpendiculairement d'est en ouest le Cardo maximus) correspond à l'actuelle rue Boudjemaâ Lebardi.\nConcernant les édifices publics de l'ère coloniale, pour la plupart bâtis sur des substructures ou des fondations d'édifices de l'époque romaine, on peut citer le collège Émile Maupas (lycée Ennahda) qui occupa l'esplanade du proscenium (la scène) du théâtre romain ; le théâtre municipal construit sur les substructures en petit appareil régulier du temple de Vénus ; le tribunal bâti sur les substructures du temple de la Victoire ; la place Marqué (actuelle 1er novembre) qui s'étend au-dessus des vestiges (qui existent toujours) d'une fontaine monumentale; l'hôpital et l'ex-caserne de France (hôtel Es Salem) qui furent édifiés sur les restes du temple de Jupiter et Bellone ; l'hospice des vieillards construit sur ce qui fut le temple de Mithra. Le mur d'enceinte colonial (1838-1930), dont il reste des pans entiers sur le Bouyala-Seb'a Ebiar avec des tours de guet et des meurtrières, épousait le trace des fortifications de l'époque romaine.\nLe génie militaire de l'armée française dut détruire le cirque (amphithéâtre), qui était situé près du cimetière européen, pour ériger le mur d'enceinte. Dans ce cirque, pouvant accueillir jusqu'à 8 000 spectateurs, se déroulaient à l'époque romaine des combats de gladiateurs et des venationes (chasses ou combats contre des animaux).\nPar ailleurs, l'église Saint-Philippe (détruite en 1979), fut édifiée en grand appareil avec le granit ocre des carrières romaines, sur l'emplacement de la basilique romaine dédiée à la martyre donatiste sainte Digna dont le tombeau et les restes, découverts en 1886, sont conservés au musée de Constantine. Enfin, la place de la Liberté correspond au Forum de la période romaine.\n\nPatrimoine moderne\nPour célébrer le centenaire de la colonisation de l’Algérie, des fêtes grandioses furent organisées en 1930 par les autorités françaises à travers tout le pays. C'est dans cette optique que la municipalité de Philippeville (Skikda) se lança dans une vaste opération d'édification d'un ensemble urbanistique de style andalou-mauresque, les prémices de ce qui allait devenir le style néo-mauresque. C'était la période faste de la colonisation. L'Algérie semblait définitivement acquise.\nII fallait donc passer à l'étape suivante, celle de s'approprier, nationaliser, intégrer et franciser l'art et le patrimoine architectural arabo-musulman de l'Algérie. Cet ensemble urbanistique comprend de véritables chef-d'œuvre architecturaux aux lignes sobres et au décor très riche c'est un exemple d'art néo-mauresque adapté par le très grand architecte attitré de la ville, Charles Montaland, aux exigences et aux nécessités modernes d'une importante administration, que ce soit celle de I'Hôtel de ville, de la gare des chemins de fer, de Ia banque centrale ou celle de la grande poste et du palais Mériem Azza. La majorité de ces constructions se situent le long du boulevard Front de mer.\n\nPersonnalités liées à Skikda\nOrdre chronologique des années de naissance.\n\nNotes et références\nNotes\nRéférences\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nTeddy Alzieu, Bône et Philippeville, éd.
