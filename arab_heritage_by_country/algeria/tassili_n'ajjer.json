      "content": "Tassili n'Ajjer (Berber: Tassili n Ajjer, Arabic: طاسيلي ناجر, romanized: ṭāssīlī naʾjir; \"Plateau of rivers\") is a mountain range in the Sahara desert, located in south-eastern Algeria. It holds one of the most important groupings of prehistoric cave art in the world and covers an area of more than 72,000 km2 (28,000 sq mi).\nThe site has been designated a national park and a Biosphere Reserve, and was inducted into the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 1982.\nThe literal English translation of Tassili n'Ajjer is 'plateau of rivers'.\n\nGeography\nTassili n'Ajjer is a plateau in south-eastern Algeria at the borders of Libya and Niger, covering an area of 72,000 km2. It ranges from 26°20′N 5°00′E east-south-east to 24°00′N 10°00′E. Its highest point is the Adrar Afao that peaks at 2,158 m (7,080 ft), located at 25°10′N 8°11′E. The nearest towns are Djanet on the southeastern edge and Illizi on the northern edge.\nThe plateau is of great geological and aesthetic interest. Its panorama of geological formations of rock forests, composed of eroded sandstone, resembles a lunar landscape and hosts a range of rock art styles.\n\nGeology\nThe range is composed largely of sandstone. The sandstone is stained by desert varnish, a thin outer layer of deposited metallic oxides that colour the rock formations variously from near-black to dull red. Erosion in the area has resulted in nearly 300 natural rock arches being formed in the south east, along with deep gorges and permanent water pools in the north.\n\nThe Tuareg Shield, an accumulation of terranes that formed during the Neoproterozoic era between 750 and 550 million years ago, encompassed the area of today's Ahaggar Mountains in Algeria, the Aïr Mountains in Niger, and the Adrar des Ifoghas in Mali. To the west lies the West African Craton, to the east the Saharan Metacraton. It expanded through accretion in the north and south, so that it also encompassed the area of today's Tassili n'Ajjer. During this epoch, the supercontinent Gondwana formed, which also included all the cratons and shields of what would later become Africa.\nDuring the subsequent Cambrian period (541 to 485 million years ago), the first sediment deposits still present today were formed in the Tassili n'Ajjer region. During this epoch, Gondwana shifted from the equatorial zone to the southern hemisphere, so that the Sahara region was located in the South Pole region during the Upper Ordovician (458 to 443 million years ago). At the end of this period, the 'Hirnantian’ ice age prevailed for a million years. An ice sheet formed, covering much of the northern half of Africa.\nIn the early Silurian period (starting 443 million years ago), the global climate changed, causing the ice of the Tuareg Shield to melt. This left behind meltwater channels that had formed under the ice. This completed the formation of the geological stratigraphy of the Inner Tassili Group. It consists mainly of sandstone and some layers of clay.\n\nDuring the Silurian and Devonian periods, transgression (the advance of the sea) from the north and northwest covered large areas of the Sahara with further layers of sediment. At that time, the Tassili n'Ajjer was the seabed near the coast, later becoming a fluvial floodplain. During the Silurian period, the stratigraphic sequence of the Intra Tassili Group was formed, which contains a lot of bioturbated clay and some sandstone. During the Devonian period, the formations of the External Tassili Group were formed, which contain a lot of sandstone alongside clays with macrofauna and some limestone. It is primarily from these two stratigraphic sequences of the Silurian and Devonian periods that petroleum and natural gas have been and continue to be extracted in the Illizi Basin, north of Illizi.\nDuring the following 200 million years, this region remained geologically a rather quiet, fairly flat mainland area without major tectonic changes or sedimentation. - Probably as early as the Cretaceous period, but especially since the Miocene (23 to 5,3 million years ago), the Tuareg Shield began to arch as a result of magmatic uplift. The uplift in the Ahaggar region ultimately reached 4,000 to 5,000 m. The Tassili n'Ajjer region was also affected, and the uplift caused its layers to tilt toward the north. Parallel to the uplift, several basins formed north and south of the Tuareg Shield, which now served as deposition areas for the eroded sediment, for example the Illizi Basin. Especially in the Miocene, the sedimentary layers of the External Tassili (the uppermost layer sequence) were completely eroded in the southern and eastern parts of the Tassili n'Ajjer. In the northern part, on the plateau of this layer group, the river systems dug up to 400 m deep into the sandstone and clay layers due to the now greater gradient.\nThe last major geological change occurred during the Pliocene (5,3 to 2,58 million years ago). Volcanism covered the Adrar region in southwestern Tassili n'Ajjer with craters, volcanic cones, and lava flows. This development continued into the early Quaternary period.\n\nEcology\nTassili n'Ajjer lies within the West Saharan montane xeric woodlands ecoregion. Due to the higher elevation of the area, coupled with the water-retentive properties of the sandstone, the vegetation here is somewhat more lush and verdant than in the lower regions of desert; in turn, this creates an attractive habitat for numerous animal species, from the smallest invertebrates, up the food chain to mammals. The park features an open woodland, primarily consisting of the endangered and endemic Saharan cypress and Saharan myrtle, in its higher-elevation eastern half. The Tassili cypress is one of the longest-living trees and organisms on Earth, after the bristlecone pines of the Western US.\nAn isolated population of the West African crocodile survived in Tassili n'Ajjer until the twentieth century; today, the species is primarily found in more tropical and sub-Saharan regions of Western and Central Africa, from Senegal to Chad. The aoudad, or Barbary sheep, is the only extant species of animal depicted in the area's ancient rock artwork.\nThe park has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of spotted, crowned and Lichtenstein's sandgrouse, Pharaoh eagle-owls, greater hoopoe-larks, bar-tailed and desert larks, pale rock martins, fulvous babblers, white-crowned and mourning wheatears, desert sparrows and trumpeter finches.\n\nArchaeology\nBackground\nAlgerian rock art has been subject to European study since 1863, with surveys conducted by \"A. Pomel (1893–1898), Stéphane Gsell (1901–1927), G. B. M. Flamand (1892–1921), Leo Frobenius and Hugo Obermaier (1925), Henri Breuil (1931–1957), L. Joleaud (1918–1938), and Raymond Vaufrey (1935–1955).\"\nTassili was already well known by the early 20th century, but Westerners were broadly introduced to it through a series of sketches made by French legionnaires, particularly Lieutenant Charles Brenans in the 1930s. He brought with him French archaeologist Henri Lhote, who would later return during 1956–1957, 1959, 1962, and 1970. Lhote's expeditions have been heavily criticized, with his team accused of faking images and of damaging paintings in brightening them for tracing and photography, which resulted in reducing the original colors beyond repair.\n\nCurrent archaeological interpretation\nThe site of Tassili was primarily occupied during the Neolithic period by transhumant pastoralist groups whose lifestyle benefited both humans and livestock. The local geography, elevation, and natural resources were optimal conditions for dry-season camping of small groups. The wadis within the mountain range functioned as corridors between the rocky highlands and the sandy lowlands. The highlands have archaeological evidence of occupation dating from 5500 to 1500 BCE, while the lowlands have stone tumuli and hearths dating between 6000 and 4000 BCE. The lowland locations appear to have been used as living sites, specifically during the rainy season. There are numerous rock shelters within the sandstone forests, strewn with Neolithic artifacts including ceramic pots and potsherds, lithic arrowheads, bowls and grinders, beads, and jewelry.\nThe transition to pastoralism following the African Humid period during the early Holocene is reflected in Tassili n'Ajjer's archaeological material record, rock art, and zooarchaeology. Further, the occupation of Tassili is part of a larger movement and climate shift within the Central Sahara. Paleoclimatic and paleoenvironment studies started in the Central Sahara around 14,000 BP and then proceeded by an arid period that resulted in narrow ecological niches. However, the climate was not consistent and the Sahara was split between the arid lowlands and the humid highlands. Archaeological excavations confirm that human occupation, in the form of hunter-gather groups, occurred between 10,000 and 7500 BP; following 7500 BP, humans began to organize into pastoral groups in response to the increasingly unpredictable climate. There was a dry period from 7900 and 7200 BP in Tassili that preceded the appearance of the first pastoral groups, which is consistent with other parts of the Saharan-Sahelian belt. The pre-Pastoral pottery excavated from Tassili dates around 9,000–8,500 BP, while the Pastoral pottery is from 7100–6000 BP.\nThe rock art at Tassili is used in conjunction with other sites, including Dhar Tichitt in Mauritania, to study the development of animal husbandry and trans-Saharan travel in North Africa. Cattle were herded across vast areas as early as 3000–2000 BCE, reflecting the origins and spread of pastoralism in the area. This was followed by horses (before 1000 BCE) and then the camel in the next millennium. The arrival of camels reflects the increased development of trans-Saharan trade, as camels were primarily used as transport in trade caravans.\n\nPrehistoric art\nThe rock formation is an archaeological site, noted for its numerous prehistoric parietal works of rock art, first reported in 1910, that date to the early Neolithic era at the end of the last glacial period during which the Sahara was a habitable savanna rather than the current desert. Although sources vary considerably, the earliest pieces of art are presumed to be 12,000 years old. The vast majority date to the ninth and tenth millennia BP or younger, according to OSL dating of associated sediments. The art was dated by gathering small fragments of the painted panels that had dried out and flaked off before being buried. Among the 15,000 engravings so far identified, the subjects depicted are large wild animals including antelopes and crocodiles, cattle herds, and humans who engage in activities such as hunting and dancing.  These paintings are some of the earliest by Central Saharan artists, and occur in the largest concentration at Tassili. Although Algeria is relatively close to the Iberian Peninsula, the rock art of Tassili n'Ajjer evolved separately from that of the European tradition. According to UNESCO, \"The exceptional density of paintings and engravings...have made Tassili world famous.\"\nSimilar to other Saharan sites with rock art, Tassili can be separated into five distinct traditions: Archaic (10,000 to 7500 BCE), Round Head (7550 to 5050 BCE), Bovidian or Pastoral (4500 to 4000 BCE), Horse (from 2000 BCE and 50 CE), and Camel (1000 BCE and onward).\nThe Archaic period consists primarily of wild animals that lived in the Sahara during the Early Holocene. These works are attributed to hunter-gather peoples, consisting of only etchings. Images are primarily of larger animals, depicted in a naturalistic manner, with the occasional geometric pattern and the human figure. Usually, the humans and animals are depicted within the context of a hunting scene.\nThe Round Head Period is associated with specific stylistic choices depicting humanoid forms and is well separated from the Archaic tradition even though hunter-gatherers were the artists for both. The art consists mainly of paintings, with some of the oldest and largest exposed rock paintings in Africa; one human figure stands over five meters and another at three and a half meters. The unique depiction of floating figures with round, featureless heads and formless bodies appear to be floating on the rock surface, hence the \"Round Head\" label. The occurrence of these paintings and motifs are concentrated in specific locations on the plateau, implying that these sites were the center of ritual, rites, and ceremonies. Most animals shown are mouflon and antelope, usually in static positions that do not appear to be part of a hunting scene.\nThe Bovidian/Pastoral period correlates with the arrival of domesticated cattle into the Sahara and the gradual shift to mobile pastoralism. There is a notable and visual difference between the Pastoral period and the earlier two periods, coinciding with the aridification of the Sahara. There is increased stylistic variation, implying the movement of different cultural groups within the area. Domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and dogs are depicted, paralleling the zooarchaeological record of the area. The scenes reference diversified communities of herders, hunters with bows, as well as women and children, and imply a growing stratification of society based on property.\nThe following Horse traditions correspond with the complete desertification of the Sahara and the requirement for new travel methods. The arrival of horses, horse-drawn chariots, and riders are depicted, often in mid-gallop, and is associated more with hunting than warfare. Inscriptions of Libyan-Berber script, used by ancestral Berber peoples, appear next to the images, however, the text is completely indecipherable.\nThe last period is defined by the appearance of camels, which replaced donkeys and cattle as the main mode of transportation across the Sahara. The arrival of camels coincides with the development of long-distance trade routes used by caravans to transport salt, goods, and enslaved people across the Sahara. Men, both mounted and unmounted, with shields, spears, and swords are present. Animals including cows and goats are included, but wild animals were crudely rendered.\nAlthough these periods are successive the timeframes are flexible and are consistently being reconstructed by archaeologists as technology and interpretation develop. The art had been dated by archaeologists who gathered fallen fragments and debris from the rock face.\n\nA notable piece common in academic writing is the \"Running Horned Woman,\" also known as the \"Horned Goddess,\" from the round head period. The image depicts a female figure with horns in midstride; dots adorn her torso and limbs, and she is dressed in fringed armbands, a skirt, leg bands, and anklets. According to Arisika Razak, Tassili's Horned Goddess is an early example of the \"African Sacred Feminine.\" Her femininity, fertility, and connection to nature are emphasized while the Neolithic artist superimposes the figure onto smaller, older figures. The use of bull horns is a common theme in later round head paintings, which reflects the steady integration of domesticated cattle into Saharan daily life. Cattle imagery, specifically that of bulls,  became a central theme in not only at Tassili, but at other nearby sites in Libya.\n\nFungoid rock art\nIn 1989, the psychedelics researcher Giorgio Samorini proposed the theory that the fungoid-like paintings in the caves of Tassili are proof of the relationship between humans and psychedelics in the ancient populations of the Sahara, when it was still a verdant land:\n\nOne of the most important scenes is to be found in the Tin-Tazarift rock art site, at Tassili, in which we find a series of masked figures in line and hieratically dressed or dressed as dancers surrounded by long and lively festoons of geometrical designs of different kinds... Each dancer holds a mushroom-like object in the right hand and, even more surprising, two parallel lines come out of this object to reach the central part of the head of the dancer, the area of the roots of the two horns. This double line could signify an indirect association or non-material fluid passing from the object held in the right hand and the mind. This interpretation would coincide with the mushroom interpretation if we bear in mind the universal mental value induced by hallucinogenic mushrooms and vegetals, which is often of a mystical and spiritual nature (Dobkin de Rios, 1984:194). It would seem that these lines – in themselves an ideogram that represents something non-material in ancient art – represent the effect that the mushroom has on the human mind... In a shelter in Tin – Abouteka, in Tassili, there is a motif appearing at least twice that associates mushrooms and fish; a unique association of symbols among ethno-mycological cultures... Two mushrooms are depicted opposite each other, in a perpendicular position about the fish motif and near the tail. Not far from here, above, we find other fish which are similar to the aforementioned, but without the side-mushrooms.\nThis theory was reused by Terence McKenna in his 1992 book Food of the Gods, hypothesizing that the Neolithic culture that inhabited the site used psilocybin mushrooms as part of its religious ritual life, citing rock paintings showing persons holding mushroom-like objects in their hands, as well as mushrooms growing from their bodies. For Henri Lhote, who discovered the Tassili caves in the late 1950s, these were obviously secret sanctuaries.\nThe painting that best supports the mushroom hypothesis is the Tassili mushroom figure Matalem-Amazar where the body of the represented shaman is covered with mushrooms. According to Earl Lee in his book From the Bodies of the Gods: Psychoactive Plants and the Cults of the Dead (2012), this imagery refers to an ancient episode where a \"mushroom shaman\" was buried while fully clothed and when unearthed sometime later, tiny mushrooms would be growing on the clothes. Earl Lee considered the mushroom paintings at Tassili fairly realistic.\nAccording to Brian Akers, writer for the Mushroom journal, the fungoid rock art in Tassili does not resemble the representations of the Psilocybe hispanica in the Selva Pascuala caves (2015), and he doesn't consider it realistic.\n\nIn popular culture\nTassili is the recording location and the title of a 2011 album by the Tuareg band Tinariwen.\nTassili Plain is a track on the 1994 album Natural Wonders of the World in Dub by dub group Zion Train.\nIn Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star, the character Altera is actually a shattered form of the deity known as Sefar, which is based on one of the drawings made in the cave group and is known in the story also as The White Titan of Tassili n'Ajjer\n\nGallery\nThe rock engravings of Tin-Taghirt\nThe Tin-Taghirt site is located in the Tassili n'Ajjer between the cities of Dider and Iherir.\n\nSee also\nList of Stone Age art\nList of cultural assets of Algeria\nSebiba\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nVideo\nThe natural arches of the Tassili n'Ajjer\nFlore et faune du Tassili n’Ajjer, 2023, French, illustrated.

      "content": "طاسيلي ناجّر أو تاسيلي نعاجر ( باللغة الطارقية تاسّيلي ن أزجر / ⵜⴰⵙⵉⵍⵉ ⵏ ⴰⵣⴶⵔ والتي تعني \"هضبة الثور\") هي سلسلة جبلية تقع في وسط الصحراء في الجنوب الشرقي للجزائر بإليزي، وقليلاً على الأراضي الليبية. يوجد فيها واحدة من أهم التشكيلات للرسومات الكهفية لما قبل التاريخ في العالم.\n\nجغرافيا\nوهي هضبة قاحلة حصوية ترتفع بأكثر من 2000 م عن سطح البحر عرضها من 50 إلى 60 كم وطولها 800 كم مشكلة مساحة تقدر72,000 كـم2 (28,000 ميل2)، أعلى قمة جبلية وهي أدرار أفاو ترتفع ب 2،158 م، ويظهر في المنحدرات العالية على ارتفاع 1500 متر في المتوسط فوق عروق مرزق وأوباري في الشرق وأدمر في تينيري في الجنوب. وإلى الشمال، تُفقد هذه الهضبة المرتفعة في كثبان إيساوان وبورهارت.\nعلى كل مساحتها ترتفع من على الرمال قمم صخرية متآكلة جدا تعرف بالغابات الصخرية وكأنها أطلال مدن قديمة مهجورة بفعل الزمن والعواصف الرملية.تتخللها فتحات في الجرف - التي لا يمكن الوصول إليها إلا سيرًا على الأقدام أو الجمال - والعديد من التصدعات والأودية التي تؤوي في بعض الأحيان قلتات والتي تتغذى من العواصف الرعدية النادرة والعنيفة التي تجوب الصحراء كل سنتين أو ثلاث سنوات.\nيسكن المسيف الطوارق مجموعة كيل أجير. مدينتها الرئيسية هي جانت، واحة صغيرة على الحافة الغربية للمنطقة.\n\nالجيولوجيا\nيتكون الطاسيلي من الأحجار الرملية، التي تتشكل من الرواسب الرسوبية الكبيرة المتراكبة من الطمي الصلب والرمل الناتج عن التآكل الجزئي للجبال البلورية من حقبة الحياة القديمة (من -541 إلى -252.2 مليون سنة ) وترسبت من المحيطات أثناء حقبة الحياة الوسطى (من -252.2 إلى -66 ما) التي تغطي الصحراء الحالية بأكملها. بعد ذلك، دفعت القاعدة المكونة من الحجر الرملي الطبقي عند الأطراف بسبب ثوران كتلة الهقار. التغيرات المناخية والمائية القوية جرفت ونحتت وشكلت الصخرة قبل حوالي 4 ملايين سنة.\nنقسم منطقة الطاسيلي إلى 03 أقسام:\nالطاسيلي الداخلي: يعود تكوينه إلى العصر الأردوفيني، وهو واقع بين النجد المتبلور للهقار والمنطقة السفلية لسهول الطاسيلي.\nالطاسيلي الخارجي : يعود تاريخه ما بين العصر السيلوري والدوفيني الأسفل ، وهو يمتد بين الأخدود الداخلي للطاسيلي والمنطقة التي يقع فيها وادي إيغرغارن.\nالأخدود أسفل الطاسيلي : يعود تاريخه إلى العصر السيلوري حوالي 420 مليون سنة، وهو عبارة عن منخفض يقع في قاعدة الطاسيلي الداخلي وقاعدة الطاسيلي الخارجي وتصب فيه معظم أودية الطاسيلي الداخلي.\nمنذ ملايين السنين، جرفت المياه في التاسيلي التربة. ثم، عندما عمّ الجفاف، جاء دور الريح لنحت وصقل هذه الصخور الرخوة دون توقف. لا تزال الأمطار النادرة، حتى الأنهار الاستثنائية، كانت السبب في هذا التآكل الكبير، وذلك لأنه لا يوجد غطاء نباتي يحتفظ بالمياه التي تحفر الصخور. درجة الحرارة هي سبب آخر للتآكل. الفرق بين الليل والنهاريصل في بعض الأحيان الخمسين درجة. تنفجر الحجارة حرفيًا بسبب تأثير هذه الاختلالات الرهيبة في الحرارة حتى تصبح غبارًا رمليًا (الظاهرة تسمى التفلق الصخري أو التكسر الهلامي ).\nتتكون كهوف طاسيلي من مجموعة من تشكيلات الصخور البركانية والرملية الغريبة الشكل والتي تشبه الخرائب والأطلال، وتعرف باسم \"الغابات الحجرية\". وتوجد الكهوف فوق هضبة مرتفعة يجاورها جرف عميق في منطقة تتواجد بها نسبة كبيرة من الكثبان الرملية المتحركة. تحتوي جدران هذه الكهوف مجموعة من النقوش الغريبة التي تمثل حياة كاملة لحضارة قديمة. ومن تحليل هذه الصور اكتشف الخبراء أن تاريخها يعود إلي 20 ألف عام.\n\nالبيئة\nبسبب الارتفاع وخصائص الاحتفاظ بالمياه في باطن أرض طاسيلي ناجر فإن الغطاء النباتي في هذه الأرض القاحلة تعتبر ثرية إلى حد ما عن الصحراء المحيطة بها فهي تشمل تواجد الغابات المنتشرة منها أشجار السرو الصحراء المتوطنة المهددة بالانقراض حيث لم يبقَ منها إلا حوالي 230 شجرة محصية، عمر كل واحدة يتعدى 2000 سنة، و ميرتل الصحراء في النصف الشرقي من أعلى النطاق.\nبيئة طاسيلي ناجر مصنفة في ملحق الشجيرات الغابات الجبلية للصحراء الغربية.\n\nالحقب التاريخية\nخلال الفترة الرطبة من العصر الحجري الحديث (ما بين 9000 و 2500 قبل الميلاد)، كانت الصحراء الكبرى مكسوة بالعشب وتصلح لأن يستوطنها البشر والحيوان مثل النعام والزرافات والفيلة والظباء. كما ساعدت وفرة المياه وبعض البحيرات الكبيرة هناك على تشجيع حياة الأسماك والتماسيح وفرس النهر. فساعدت هذه الظروف المؤاتية صيادي البراري وفيما بعد الرعاة على بناء المخيمات والمساكن في مختلف هضاب وأراضي الصحراء المرتفعة الخصبة.\nوبحلول عام 2500 قبل الميلاد، أصبحت الصحراء، باستثناء نهر النيل، أرضا قاحلة فلم تعد تصلح أن يسكنها بني البشر. ولكن ذلك الماضي الخصب بقي من خلال الرسومات والنقوش التي تركها السكان مجسدة على الصخور عبر بقاع الصحراء. فعلى تلك الصخور أصبحت الرسومات الجميلة للأشكال البشرية تذكارا مرئيا لمعتقدات وممارسات سكان شمال أفريقيا الأقدمون خلال فترات تكيفهم مع بيئتهم المتغيرة واكتسابهم لأدوات وعادات جديدة.\nفأكثر من نصف الفنون المنقوشة على الصخور الصحراوية توجد في منطقة طاسيلي ناجر (\"سهل الوديان العديدة\" بلغة الطوارق) جنوب شرق الجزائر. وتوجد مواقع أخرى في الصحراء الليبية وشمال النيجر. فقد تم التعرف على أزيد من 30 ألف موقع إلى حد الآن.\nوأصبح تحديد تاريخ تلك الرسومات والنقوش موضع نقاش ساخن بين العلماء رغم أنهم يتفقون عموما على أنه يمكن تقسيم تلك الحقبة إلى أربع حقب رئيسية متتالية بناء على أسلوب ومحتوى الرسومات:\n\nالحقبة البائدة أو البابلسية (مرحلة الصيد البري قبل 5000 قبل الميلاد):\nتُجسد النقوش المحاكية للطبيعة على الأحجار ذات الأشكال الضخمة الحيوانات التي تعرضت للانقراض في تلك الحقبة بما فيها البقر الوحشي والفيلة ووحيدي القرن والزرافات والظباء وفرس النهر. ويكاد لا يكون هناك أي تجسيد للحيوانات الأليفة مما قد يعني أن السكان آنذاك قد اعتاشوا بصيد الحيوانات الضخمة. وتظهر أشكال الرجال وهم مسلحون بالعصي والرماح والفؤوس والأقواس. وتتمثل أحسن النماذج عن هذه الحقبة في نقوشات وادي دجيرات في طاسيلي الناجر، والزرافات في منطقة أير بالنيجر وبعض النقوش في منطقة المساك اليبية.\n\nالحقبة البوفيدية (رعاة القطعان) 4500 إلى 2500 قبل الميلاد:\nتوافق هذه الحقبة وصول القطعان إلى شمال أفريقيا ما بين 4500 و 4000 قبل الميلاد. إذ أن غالبية النقوش والرسومات تعود إلى هذه الحقبة. وتبين بعض المشاهد أشخاصا وهم منهمكون في قضاء أعمالهم اليومية بينما تجسد نماذج أخرى قطعان الحيوانات المولفة والأغنام والماعز وأحيانا تبين الرعاة بقرب قطعانهم. هذه الرسومات لها سحنة أكثر جمالا بفضل استخدام اللون الصلصالي الأحمر والصبغات البيضاء. ويعتقد أن الرسامين كانوا من الرعاة الرحل يشبه أسلوبه معيشتهم قبائل النوبة اليوم في السودان والقبائل الفولانية في النيجر. وتوجد غالبية الرسومات البوفيدية في طاسيلي وجبال أكاكوس في ليبيا.\n\nحقبة الخيول (حوالي 1200 قبل الميلاد):\nتجسد الرسومات من هذه الحقبة بشرا مسلحين بأسلحة صغيرة وعربات تجرها الخيول. ويعتقد أن الحصان كان قد بدأ استخدامه في الصحراء حوال 1200 قبل الميلاد. كما تعتبر جودة هذه الرسومات هزيلة بالمقارنة مع الحقبة السابقة حيث تبدو أشكال البشر أقل حجما وتتخذ شكل ساعات رملية.\n\nحقبة الجمال (1200 قبل الميلاد):\nبحلول هذا التاريخ، تمت عملية التصحر في شمال أفريقيا فاستعيض عن الحصان بالجمل \"صديق الصحراء\" في فن الرسم على الصخور وفي حياة الناس.\nخضعت عملية تقسيم تاريخ شمال أفريقيا هذه للتمحيص من قبل العلماء الذين يتساءلون عن مدى مصداقية التسلسل الزمني على صعيد الصحراء ككل. حيث يعيق حجم الصحراء الهائل والتعقيدات السياسية في المنطقة إجراء دراسة أكثر خصوصية تركز على التنوع الإقليمي. ولهذا يبقى فن النقش على الصخور عموما مجالا ينقصه البحث وبذلك غير مفهوم بشكل جيد.\nكانت الصحراء الغربية لشمال أفريقيا مصبا لنهر النيل قبل عشرات آلاف السنين كما يقول بعض العلماء مستدلين على الكمية الهائلة من المياه الجوفية والبحيرات المتواجدة بها.\n\nفن ماقبل التاريخ\nتم العثور على تحف فنية من أشكال لحيوانات في نطاق الطاسيلي ويلاحظ أيضا لوحات ما قبل التاريخ في الصخور وغيرها من المواقع الأثرية القديمة، التي يرجع تاريخها إلى العصر الحجري الحديث عندما كان المناخ المحلي رطب بكثير مع تواجد السافانا بدلا من الصحراء.وتتنوع الصور الموجودة بين صور لعمليات رعي الأبقار وسط مروج ضخمة، وصور لخيول، ونقوش لانهار وحدائق غناء،وحيوانات برية، ومراسم دينية، وبعض الآلهة القديمة.\nوقد كان الوصول إلي اكتشاف هذه الكهوف صعبا ومتأخرا، نتيجة لوقوعها في قلب منطقة \"جبارين\" حيث الصحراء قاحلة والمناخ شديد الحرارة. يسكن السلسلة الجبلية فرع من الطوارق وهم كل الأجر يتمركزون في عاصمة الطاسيلي جانت\n\nتصنيف اليونيسكو\nفي 1982 أدخلت اليونسكو الموقع في قائمة التراث العالمي وفي 1986 محمية الإنسان والبيوسفير حيوانات نادرة في طريق الانقراض وجدت ملاذا في المنطقة كاللأروية (الضأن البربري) وأنواع عديدة من الغزال والفهود وحيوانات أخرى.\nوبعد أن صنفتها اليونيسكو ضمن الإرث التاريخي الوطني في يوليو 1972، تم إدراج طاسيلي ناجر إرثا حضاريا عالميا سنة 1982 بفضل ثرواتها الثقافية ثم لقيت الاعتراف في شبكة برنامج اليونيسكو الإنسان والمجال الحيوي كمحمية إنسانية ومجال حيوي، في حين تم إدراج بحيرة إهرير سنة 2001 كمنطقة رطبة ذات أهمية عالمية ضمن لائحة معاهدة رامسار الدولية حول المناالطق الرطبة.\nيشكل الموقع أكبر متحف للرسوم الصخرية البدائة في كل الكرة الأرضية وقد تم إحصاء أكثر من 30،000 رسم تصف الطقوس الدينية والحياة اليومية لللإنسان الدي عاش في هذه المناطق أثناء حقبة ما قبل التاريخ. مما ينبهنا ويجعلنا نتخيل كيف كانت هذه المناطق القاحلة العقيمة تعج الخضرة والحياة.\n\nالنشاط السياحي\nبعد أن تم تصنيفها من طرف المسؤولين الجزائريين كحديقة وطنية محمية وتصنيفها من طرف اليونيسكو كإرث حضاري عالمي تم إعادة إحياء هيبتها العالمية وذلك بإدراجها في مختلف المزارات والمعارض السياحية العالمية وهي تعتبر مع جبال الهقار قلب توجه السياح المحليين والأجانب لما تمتلكه من مواقع تجذب السياح فهي تمتلك أكبر متحف للنقوش الحجرية عبر مناطقها بهضبة مداك (تامريت وسفار وجبرين)، كما يعتبر رواق واد جرات الموجود على الهواء الطلق الأكبر من نوعه في المعمورة وهو يمثل أجمل رواق للنقوش الصخرية في الجزائر بمحطاته ال75 التي تضم أزيد من 4.000 شكل تم جردها عبر مسافة تقدر بنحو 30 كم.وذلك دون احتساب باقي الرسومات الأخرى ومجموعها 30.000 شكل.\nوللحفاظ على محمية طاسيلي تم القيام بإجراءات تطبيقية لحماية السياح وعذرية الأثار كمرافقة مرشد رسمي لزوار الحديقة يحترم إجراءات الحماية التي وضعت منذ سنوات من طرف ديوان الحظيرة الوطنية للطاسيلي، ومسار الجولة يحدد بصفة مسبقة كما أن الزيارات تكون مرخصة وكل زائر يتوجب عليه الإمضاء على ميثاق حسن السلوك وذلك قبل الانطلاق في جولته حتى يضمن جولة سياحية في منطقة تحكي حكايتها النقوش الحجرية.\nيسمى هذا النوع من السياحة بسياحة المغامرة (Active vacation) التي تعتبر نوعا من الرياضة، وتقتصر على مجموعة من السياح المتدربين والمتمرسين. يمثل هذا المجال السياحي حولي 8٪ من سوق السياحة العالمية. مجموعة كبيرة من الجزائريين تعيش على هذه السياحة التي تعرف تدهورا بسبب الارهاب والسياسة السياحية الفاشلة.\n\nانظر أيضًا\nالمقابر الجنائزية ونقوش الطاوز

      "content": "Le tassili n’Ajjer (en berbère : tasili n Ajer, en tifinagh : ⵜⴰⵙⵉⵍⵉ ⵏ ⴰⵣⴶⵔ, Tasili n Azjer ; en arabe : طاسيلي ناجر) est un massif de montagnes situé au centre du Sahara, dans le Sud-Est de l'Algérie et dont la frange orientale se trouve en territoire libyen.\n\nGéographie\nSituation, topographie\nCe haut plateau aride se trouve à plus de 1 000 mètres d'altitude et s'étend sur 670 km du nord-ouest au sud-est et 200 km environ du nord-est au sud-ouest, soit une superficie de près de 72 000 km2. Sur toute sa surface se dressent des formations rocheuses créées par l'érosion, émergeant des dunes de sable, qui évoquent de loin les ruines de villes antiques. Illizi se trouve au pied du versant nord et Djanet en bordure du versant sud-ouest.\nLe tassili n’Ajjer culmine à 2 158 mètres d'altitude à l'Adrar Afao et émerge en hautes falaises à 1 500 mètres en moyenne au-dessus des ergs de Mourzouq et d'Oubari à l'est et d'Admer dans le Ténéré au sud. Au nord, ce haut plateau se perd dans les dunes d'Issaouane et de Bourharet.\nLe relief du tassili n’Ajjer est particulièrement tourmenté : les immenses plaines rocheuses qui laissent parfois la place à des « forêts » de monolithes sont creusées d’akbas (trous dans les escarpements qui ne sont accessibles qu'à pied ou à dos de dromadaire) et de multiples failles et canyons recelant parfois une guelta alimentée par les rares et violents orages qui ravinent le désert tous les deux ou trois ans.\nLe massif est habité par les Touaregs du groupe Kel Ajjer. Sa ville principale est Djanet, une petite oasis située en bordure occidentale de la région.\n\nGéologie\nLe bouclier touareg, un ensemble de terranes qui s'est formé au cours du Néoprotérozoïque, il y a 750 à 550 millions d'années, couvrait le territoire des montagnes actuelles de l'Hoggar en Algérie, de l'Aïr au Niger et de l'adrar des Ifoghas au Mali. À l'ouest se trouve le craton ouest-africain, à l'est le mégacraton saharien oriental. Il s'est agrandi par accrétion au nord et au sud, de sorte qu'il englobait également la région de l'actuel tassili n'Ajjer. Au cours de cette époque, le supercontinent Gondwana s'est formé, auquel appartenaient également tous les cratons et boucliers de l'Afrique ultérieure.\nAu cours du Cambrien qui a suivi (541 à 485  millions d'années), les premiers dépôts de sédiments encore présents aujourd'hui se sont formés dans la région du tassili n'Ajjer. Au cours de cette époque, le Gondwana s'est déplacé de la zone équatoriale vers l'hémisphère sud de la Terre, de sorte que la région du Sahara se trouvait dans la région du pôle Sud à l'Ordovicien supérieur (458 à 443 millions d'années). À la fin de cette époque, la glaciation hirnantienne a régné pendant un million d'années. Une calotte glaciaire s'est formée, recouvrant une grande partie de la moitié nord de l'Afrique. Dans la région à l'ouest de Ghat, dans le tassili n'Ajjer, des formations rocheuses plates présentant des marques d'abrasion témoignent du mouvement des glaces pendant cette période.\nAu début du Silurien (il y a 443 millions d'années), le climat mondial a changé, provoquant la fonte des glaces du bouclier touareg. Cela a laissé derrière lui des canaux d'eau de fonte qui s'étaient formés sous la glace. Cela a achevé la formation de la stratigraphie géologique du groupe des tassilis internes. Il se compose principalement de grès et de quelques couches d'argile.\n\nAu cours des périodes silurienne et dévonienne, la transgression (l'avancée de la mer) depuis le nord et le nord-ouest a recouvert de vastes zones du Sahara de nouvelles couches de sédiments. À cette époque, le tassili n'Ajjer était le fond marin près de la côte, avant de devenir une plaine inondable fluviale. Au cours du Silurien, la séquence stratigraphique du groupe de la dépression ou sillon intra-tassilien s'est formée, contenant beaucoup d'argile bioturbée et quelques fines couches de  grès. Au cours du Dévonien, les formations du groupe des tassilis externes se sont formées, contenant beaucoup de grès ainsi que de l'argile avec de la macrofaune et des couches de calcaire. Ce sont surtout ces deux séries stratigraphiques du Silurien et du Dévonien qui contiennent, dans le bassin d'Illizi au nord du tassili n'Ajjer, des gisements de pétrole et de gaz naturel qui sont exploités.\nPendant les 200 millions d'années qui ont suivi, cette région est restée géologiquement une zone continentale plutôt calme et assez plate, sans grands changements tectoniques ni sédimentations. Probablement dès le Crétacé, mais surtout depuis le Miocène (23 à 5,3 millions d'années), le bouclier touareg a commencé à se bomber sous l'effet d'une poussée magmatique. Le soulèvement dans la région de l'Ahaggar a finalement atteint 4 000 à5000 m. La région du tassili n'Ajjer a également été touchée, et le gonflement a provoqué une inclinaison de ses couches vers le nord. Parallèlement au soulèvement, plusieurs bassins se sont formés au nord et au sud du bouclier touareg, qui ont alors servi de zones de dépôt pour les sédiments érodés, par exemple le bassin d'Illizi. C'est surtout au Miocène que les couches sédimentaires du groupe des tassilis externes (la série de couches supérieure) ont été complètement érodées dans les parties sud et est du massif.\nLe dernier changement géologique majeur s'est produit au Pléistocène (il y a 5,3 à 2,58 millions d'années). Le volcanisme a recouvert la région de l'Adrar, au sud-ouest du tassili n'Ajjer, de cratères, de cônes volcaniques et de coulées de lave. Cette évolution s'est poursuivie jusqu'au début du Quaternaire.\nDans la partie nord, sur le plateau du Groupe des Tassilis externes, les systèmes fluviaux se sont enfoncés jusqu'à 400 m de profondeur dans les couches de grès et d'argile en raison de la pente désormais plus grande. Mais pendant les périodes de sécheresse des époques passées et même aujourd'hui les vents chargés de grains de sable usèrent et sculptèrent les grès meubles. Les rares pluies, les exceptionnelles crues, demeurent une cause d'érosion importante, car nul couvert végétal ne retient les eaux qui creusent les roches. Les températures sont une autre cause de l'érosion : la différence entre la nuit et le jour est parfois de cinquante degrés et les roches éclatent littéralement par l'effet de ces variations brutales jusqu'à devenir poussière de sable (phénomène appellé cryoclastie ou gélifraction).\n\nFaune et flore\nEntre 17 000 et 12 000 ans avant le présent, le tassili n’Ajjer était recouvert d'une végétation verdoyante, qui évolua progressivement vers la savane, puis la steppe de type sahelien, avant de devenir un désert il y a 7 000 ans avant le présent. Il en demeure quelques espèces-reliques comme des myrtes à proximité des trous d'eau et des cyprès du Tassili (tarout) dont il subsiste une centaine de spécimens près de Tamrit. De cette époque subsistent également le mouflon à manchettes et quelques survivants d'une faune aquatique jadis variée : des poissons dans certaines gueltas, des crevettes dans l'oasis de Djanet et même des crocodiles, découverts en 1924 : les crocodiles de l'Imhirou.\n\nHistoire\nLe tassili n'Ajjer est englobé avec l'erg Admer et la Tadrart Rouge dans le parc culturel du Tassili (138 000 km2) lors de sa création le 27 juillet 1972. Le parc est inscrit depuis 1982 sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO et classé réserve de biosphère depuis 1986. Des animaux en voie de disparition tels que le mouflon et des gazelles y ont trouvé refuge.\nLe tassili n'Ajjer et son parc culturel sont considérés comme l'un des plus grands et anciens « musées rupestres à ciel ouvert » du monde, au même titre que les fresques des aborigènes d'Australie ou des khoïsan de Namibie. Il abrite notamment les gravures rupestres de l'Oued Djerat et celles du plateau de Sefar datant d'environ 9 à 10 000 ans avant le présent, rappelant qu'à l'époque où le Sahara était verdoyant et fertile, des populations de chasseurs et de pasteurs y vivaient : nombreux sont les dessins représentant des troupeaux de bovins menés par des bergers. Leurs œuvres d'art figurent des scènes de chasse, de danse et d'affrontements, ainsi que de nombreux restes de poteries ou de pierres taillées. Les peintures rupestres ont été décrites par Henri Lhote dont les travaux ont été d'une part considérés, depuis l'indépendance de l'Algérie, comme un pillage et une dégradation du site et d'autre part utilisés par l'auteur sensationnaliste Erich von Däniken, pour étayer sa théorie des anciens astronautes qui interprète les masques rituels africains comme des combinaisons d'extraterrestres.\n\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nArticles connexes\nHoggar\nTadrart Acacus\nParc culturel du Tassili\nCyprès du Tassili (Cupressus dupreziana)\nSéfar\nSebeïba célébration compétitive de la région de Djanet\nArt rupestre du Sahara\nListe de sites pétroglyphiques en Algérie\nListe de sites d'art rupestre en Afrique\nListe de fossiles d'hominidés\nSites préhistoriques en Algérie\nListe des sites et monuments classés en Algérie\nListe du patrimoine mondial en Algérie\nListe du patrimoine culturel immatériel de l'humanité en Algérie\n\nBibliographie\nJean-Dominique Lajoux (préf.

      "content": "## Overview\nTassili n'Ajjer Cultural Park is in Saharan Algeria. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n## Understand\nThe Tassili n'Ajjer mountain range gained world fame after the discovery of ancient rock art in the 1930s. Over the years, more than 15000 petroglyphs and paintings were identified, as were a great number of archeological remains. With numerous stone tools and artifacts, ceramics, burial mounds, enclosures and general habitational remains, Tassili n'Ajjer has provided archeologists with a wealth of information about life in the region in Neolithic times. Therefore​, it is considered one of the most important sites of prehistoric cave art in the world.\nAs if all of that wasn't enough, Tassili n'Ajjer Cultural Park boast some stunning Saharan landscapes. Today, the massive Tassili itself is as good as uninhabited but the park attracts a good number of tourists and researchers alike.\n\n## Landscape\nAlthough the magnificent archeological treasures are the centre point of attention, the landscapes of Tassili n'Ajjer alone make a visit more than worthwhile. Centuries of changing climates and erosion have resulted in stunning geological formations of eroded sandstone rocks, creating an almost lunar landscape with so-called \"rock forests\" often reaching as far the eye can see. To see the most of the parks natural panoramas requires multiple day trips, but the majestic canyons and countless arches - most without official names - make up for all efforts you'll have to make.\n\n## Climate\nAs temperatures reach serious low points in December and January, and extreme highs from April to September, the main trekking seasons are October-November and February-March.\n\n## Get in\nThe nearest town and starting point of most tours into Tassili n'Ajjer is the oasis city Djanet. Air Algerie operates regular flights between Algiers and Djanet. The connection with flights to Paris, for example, are good, with rather short transfer times. Getting there from Paris should be possible in a 7-hour time frame, with return tickets (including the Algiers-Djanet flight) starting under €600. Furthermore, there are flights between Djanet and Illizi, In Amenas, Ghardaïa, and Ouargla.\nIf you're travelling overland, route N3 runs through the park to Djanet, but there's as good as no organized bus transport. Hitchhiking is a possibility, but comes with all the obvious risks. There is a bus to the Libyan border, but the prices for that trip are high and rising. In short, the main alternative to flying in, is driving in with you own (rented or not) vehicle. The road is long and mostly without great landscapes, but for independent travellers an overland approach was the preferred method for a long time. However, after the 2003 kidnappings regulations for overland travel tightened, making guides compulsory and off-track driving off-limits. As a result of these rules and the bureaucratic hassle that came with it, prices rose significantly.\n\n## Fees and permits\nAccess to the park and its sites is restricted, and you'll need to buy a permit to enter, plus a separate one if you want to take pictures. These can be obtained via all government-approved tour agencies or a Tassili Cultural Park conservationist. Typically, you should get your permit just the same day.\nTassili Cultural Park Office, BP 11, 33100 Djanet, ☏ +213 29 47 52 82.\n\n## Get around\nYou are allowed to work your own way around the authorized areas of Illizi, Bordj-el-Haous, and Djanet Fadnoun, but visiting the sites is only allowed when accompanied by an official tour guide. Tours include jeep rides, but to reach the plateau at the Tassili top, you'll have to rely on your own legs and some donkey or dromedary help. There is no road to the top, but you can choose from 3 passes: Afilalet, Assakao, and Aroun. Dromedaries can only access the Assakao pass, but donkeys manage all three options. As trips to the top take several days, count on taking lots of water and of course camping equipment.\nArranging a tour and supplies is relatively easy, as there are many small travel agencies around. Normally, it is possible to arrive in Djanet and set up a trip leaving the next day. There is no public transport available to get around the massive park.\n\n## See\nAncient rock art: petroglyphs and paintings depicting prehistoric life. You'll encounter images of cattle and wildlife, as well as figures, festivities and hunting scenes. Unfortunately, some of the most well-known images have been damaged due to copying by early discoverers and later travellers. Nevertheless, there are plenty of other, equally wonderful paintings that remain. Note the nature of wildlife depicted, which bears witness to the much moister climate of those ancient times, when there were lakes and rivers, and ample game to allow for human occupation of the area.\nRock formations and unique panoramas. Thousands of years of erosion by water and wind have sculptured a unique and massive collection of arches, labyrinths of sandstone streets and pinnacles, natural amphitheatres, steep gorges and other spectacular landscapes.\n\n## Do\nAs you'll need a guide to take you to the rock art sites, booking a tour is one of the first things you'll have to do. There's a good number of small agencies. Feel free to look around a bit and ask around. Prices can vary and are constantly rising. At the larger agencies, prices around 60 euro per person per day are not unusual.\n[dead link] Agence Essendilene. One of the larger agencies, and with a website. Offers 4WD and camel tours, as well as treks to the plateau.\nMohamed Touggui Travel Agency, BP 115 33100 Djanet, ☏ +213 66 62 15 77.\n\n## Eat\nIn Djanet, several basic restaurants are around and easy to spot in the centre. Once you're out in the park however, no food facilities are available. Everything you need, you'll have to take with you. When choosing a tour you typically have the choice between all-in versions, where camping equipment, food and water are provided for you, or a no-frills tour where you'll have to bring your own. In that case, make arrangements with your tour agency for sufficient pack animals.\n\n## Sleep\nYou might expect that the considerable foreign interest in Tassili n'Ajjer over the years would have led to ample facilities in the park and in Djanet. However, it has not. Lodging options in Djanet are limited and basic, and once you're headed into the park itself there are no facilities other than some stone windbreaks that previous travellers have left for your convenience. As for camping gear, it is possible to rent all or some of it, but bringing your own is the best idea still.\n\n## Djanet\nMost travel agencies offer basic lodging for their customers, but don't expect a lot more than a simple field bed or even just a safe place to put down your sleeping bag.\n\n## Around the sites\nThere are a number of designated camping spots, in an attempt to keep travellers litter from spreading too much. Your guide will typically determine where to sleep, and will in most cases refer to one of these spots. In several places, piled stone walls indicate trash areas. Leaving any litter there, or taking it with you, is preferred over burning, or burying it in the sand.\n\n## Stay safe\nPolitical situation: Tassili n'Ajjer covers a massive area of Algeria, on the border of Libya, Niger and Mali. Make sure to check the situation in the area prior to booking, as it is not the most stable of regions.\nSnakes and scorpions are to be avoided. Although snake bites in this area can be fatal, the animals are rare and easily spotted as they leave distinctive marks in the sand. Also, they typically don't come towards people. To be sure however, don't camp too close to vegetation and don't walk into thick undergrowth. Scorpions are less rare but also less deadly. Take the same precautions you would in all countries where scorpions are found: check your shoes before putting them on, and don't put your hands or feet into rock crevasses.",
