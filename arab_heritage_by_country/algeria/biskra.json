      "content": "Biskra (Arabic: بسكرة) is the capital city of Biskra Province, Algeria. In 2007, its population was recorded as 307,987. Biskra is located in northeastern Algeria, about 248 miles (399 km) from Algiers, 71 miles (114 km) southwest of Batna and 137 miles (220 km) north of Touggourt. It is nicknamed \"The Queen of the Zibans\", \"The Door of the Desert\" or \"The Saharan Nice\" because of its location at the beginning of the Sahara Desert. Due to its geographical location, its climate and natural resources, particularly farming, Biskra has always been a crossroad between the cities in the north and south. It has seen the passage of several civilizations, from the Romans and the Arabs to the French.\nIn 1844, Biskra became a French garrison, which saw fighting during rebellions in 1849 and 1871.\nCurrently the city of Biskra has 28 neighborhoods, including the three principal neighborhoods of Korra, City 60 Logements, and Equipment Zones. It is in the southern part of the Algerian rail system, and has become a popular winter resort.\n\nEtymology\nThe city has been known by many names, including Biskra, Sokkra, Vescra, Vecera, Vescera, Adbesran. Historians do not agree on the origins of the current name. Some say its name comes from \"Vescera\", which means \"station\" or \"place\" of commercial exchange, due to its location connecting north and south. The Roman leader Betolimih Benyouba named it \"the river of destiny\" because of the Sidi Zarzour (its current name) that crosses the city.\nSome researchers say that its name was derived from the ancient Roman name \"Adebesran\" because of the geothermal source that is located near the city, known as Salhine Hammam. Other sources say that the name comes from the word \"Sokkra\" because of the quality of the sweet dates in the city's oases. Still others claim that the current name was given to the city by the Carthaginians.\nIn honor of the city, the name was given to an oasis, Biskra Palms, near Palm Springs, California.\n\nHistory\nGaetuli\nThe Gaetuli first appeared in North Africa during the 3rd millennium BC. They settled in a large territory south of the Roman provinces of Africa and Mauritania. According to the Greek historian Strabo, they were the most numerous people of North Africa yet the least known. Among the oldest references to the Gaetuli are those of the Carthaginians, who indicated that the Prince of the Gaetuli proposed to marry Élyssa (or Dido for the Romans), the founding queen of Carthage (present-day Tunisia) around 815 BC. However, references in ancient Egypt of certain tribes go back to 1350 BC, during the reign of Akhenaten of the eighteenth dynasty, speak of cattle trade with this people.\nThe Gaetuli are probably the origin of the Berber calendar, which begins around 943–949 BC, which would be after the victory of a coalition of Gétules over the Egyptians. This coalition, formed by the North African tribes, left southwestern Algeria, increasing its force as it passed through North Africa. The coalition led by Shoshenq (Berber name: Sheshnaq) defeated Pharaoh Psusennes II. Following this victory, Sheshnaq married the pharaoh's daughter, settled on the throne of Egypt under the name of Sheshonq in 952 BC, and founded the 22nd Dynasty. This biblical event is mentioned in the Old Testament, which speaks of the pillaging of this leader of the Machaouach tribe.\nWhile traversing the desert, the Gaetuli arrived with the Taureg at Tassili, where they stayed for an extended time and subsequently mixed with the Tuareg and learned the Tamazight language for cultural and commercial exchanges. However, the Gaetuli eventually began to feel out of place and decided to continue north.\nIn Algeria, they settled at the edge of the Aures, where they posed problems to Roman infiltration in the 3rd century BC as they were stellar horsemen and became dreaded in combat. It was necessary to involve a late Roman politician, Gaius Marius, to negotiate exploration of the South against concessions of agricultural land around Cirta and Setifis, at the time under Roman rule; a trick of dispersing them and so diminished in their strength. Thus, the Gétule were occupied by the Romans.\n\nRoman colonization\nThe city of Biskra experienced many violent wars during the Roman colonization, including the resistance war led by the Berber leader Tacfarinas, followed by his successor, the militant Jugurtha \"Youghorta\". With the help of the inhabitants of the city, who provided human and material support, Jugurtha destroyed the Roman army at the end of the so-called Numidia region.\n\nThe Vandals in the 4th century\nThe Vandals \"Oundals\" invaded the city of Biskra and occupied all its land, but the resistance and continuous fighting of its inhabitants forced the Vandals to integrate with them. After a few decades, the Romans took over the city, where they built obstacles to protect themselves from the vengeance of the population.\n\nThe arrival of the Arab conqueror Uqba ibn Nafi al-Fihri in the 7th century\nThey remained with such vigilance until the arrival of the Arab conqueror Uqba ibn Nafi al-Fihri in the 7th century AD. During this period, the whole area came under the Arab-Muslim monarchy. After 20 years of conquest, Uqba ibn Nafi died in 683 AD when he returned from Morocco with his army. His death was organized by an ambush mounted by his adversary, the Numidian prince (Berber) Koceila and his army at Tahouda, a small village located 5 km from the oasis \"Sidi Okba\". His body was buried in the mosque of the city that took his name. According to the imam of this mosque, it contains more than 300 tombs and is the 4th holy place of Islam, after Mecca, Medina and Aksa.\nIn the early 10th century, Biskra and the entire Ziban area were conquered by the kings of Beni Hammad.\n\nThe Hillal Bannis in the 12th century\nFollowed by the Kabyla of Elathbend banished Hilal (Hilalian Arabs) who removed and confiscated the property of the inhabitants. They asked for the help of the Almohads of the kingdom of Marrakech in the 12th century.\n\nIn the book Al Istibsar fi 'agaib al-Amsar, written in the late 12th century, the author describes the city as:\"A large city, surrounded by many fortresses and thriving villages, and it serves as their capital. It has a vast forest abundant with palm trees, olive trees, and various fruits. Biskra is particularly known for its numerous palm trees. [..] A large river flows through the forest of Biskra, descending from the Aurès Mountains, irrigating its orchards and palm groves. It stretches for about six miles through a continuous forest connected to the city, running through its villages. Biskra is also a center of jurisprudence and knowledge, home to scholars. Among its villages is a place called Malsoun.\"\n\nThe Hafsids in the 14th century\nIn the 14th century, the Hafsid arrived in Tunisia and Algeria. Biskra became an important hub for the Hafsid of Tunisia where it remained under lure monarchy and direction for a long time then under the authority of the Marinid Sultanate of Fez and banned Abd-Elouadi and the Znatiyin of Tlemcen.\n\nThe conquest of the city by the Turks in 1541\nIn 1541, the Turks began their conquest of the city under the direction of Hocine Agha who defended the city of Algiers at the time and brought out the strength of Charles Compte of the latter.\nThe Ottoman Empire remained in the city for three centuries until the French colonized it.\n\nFrench colonization from 1844\nAfter the French conquest of Biskra in 1844, the site was fortified to secure the area against uprisings. El-hadj Mohammed Esaghire Elokbi, as the successor to El-Emir Abdelkader, waged continued war against the French, attacking the French forces under Lamoriciere on 23 December 1847. Elokbi also opposed the Ben Ghana clan as well as Ahmed Bey's claim as ruler of Constantine. Resistance continued in the Ziban and Aurès Moufrntains.\nIn Biskra the local chief Bou Zian rallied the people against the palm tax, seizing the moated fortification of Zaatcha 20 km from Biskra. The French marched on Zaatcha, laying siege for months. It finally fell after 53 days of attacks by a French force of 7,000 troops. Bou Zian was killed. The French counted the loss of 2130. French control nonetheless remained tenuous when attacks were mounted again in 1879 at El-kamri.\nSome 100 years after the battle of Zaatcha, in 1954 Biskra was again the scene of anti-French assaults during the Algerian War of Independence where house-to-house battles cost many lives.\n\nIn culture\nAt the end of the 19th century Biskra, a popular spa town and gateway to the Sahara, became a center for artists and photographers such as Émile Frechon, Alexandre Bougault and Rudolf Franz Lehnert. From 1872 to 1920 the French Count Albert Landon de Longueville hosted in his villa-cum-chateau at Biskra (today Villa Bénévent), nobility, artists and writers, including Béla Bartok, Oscar Wilde, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, André Gide, Nasreddine Dinet, Eugène Fromentin, Karl Marx, Anatole France, Francis James and Henri Matisse.\nBiskra is the setting of key sections of André Gide's 1902 novel The Immoralist and lesser known 1897 prose-poem Les nourritures terrestres (The Fruits of the Earth), and he visited the town in 1895 (for a fortnight from 31 January) with Lord Alfred Douglas, following a meeting with Oscar Wilde in Blida and Algiers.\nThe French artist Henri Matisse has a work titled Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra) an oil painting finished in 1907.\nThe Hungarian composer Béla Bartók collected traditional music in Biskra in 1913.\nThe Polish composer Karol Szymanowski, who traveled to North Africa, seemed to have been quite impressed by Biskra. This trip probably aroused genuine interest in the North African/ Arabic culture. He composed many pieces influenced by his experience there. He sent a postcard from Biskra on 11 April 1914.\nDiana Mayo, the protagonist of Edith Maude Hull's popular 1919 novel The Sheik, starts her journey into the desert from Biskra, and in the identically named 1921 silent movie The Sheik starring Rudolph Valentino in perhaps his most famous role.\nWinston Churchill's cousin, sculptor and author Clare Sheridan held a salon in Biskra in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nGeography\nBiskra is located in the north-east of Algeria, in the district of Biskra. The city lies about 248 miles (399 km) from Algiers, 71 miles (114 km) southwest of Batna and 137 miles (220 km) north of Touggourt. She is nicknamed \"The Queen of the Zibans\", \"The door of the desert\" or \"The Saharan Nice\" because of its location which is the beginning of the desert.\nIt is located at an altitude of 87 m (285 ft) in the northern part of the Sahara Desert.\nApart from the mountains that surround it, the topography of Biskra is generally very flat. Part of the city is surrounded by the Sfa Pass and the Ziban Mountains. In the outskirts of Biskra, the landscape is very arid with all the same vegetation that vary depending on the location. Small water points can be found in the outskirts of Biskra, especially in the oases and canyons of the mountains around El Kantara. The prefecture of Biskra is crossed by Oued Labiod waterways, Oued El Arab, Djedi, Oued Meziraâ, Oued El and Oued el Gantara. The city covers an area of 127.55 km2 (49.25 sq mi). It has a population of 307,987 and is the 10th most populous city. It has a population density of 1,612.0 inhabitants per square meter.

The sunset is around 5:30 pm on 21 December and at 7:54 pm on 21 June.\n\nCityscape\nNeighborhoods\nThe city of Biskra has gone through three phases before getting to where it is today. Started by the pre-colonial phase which testifies, that the city was pending this period under Roman rule over country of the Berbers, and having taken the role of the capital of southern Numidia, and the\nA very prosperous city, built by the Muslims in the Middle Ages. During the Turkish period the city was hit by epidemics, binding occupiers of the fort to leave the city to settle, in a group scattered the interior of the palm grove, south of the city, around two elements of the form local production, the built environment that are the mosque and seguias, besides the use local building materials.\nSecondly, the city was marked by the colonial phase characterized by the building of fort Saint Germain on the northern part, and the construction of a city (the colonial checkerboard) by an urban model, different from the previous one, and having undergone several extension, particularly the 1st and 2nd and the Dervau Plan, followed during the 50s, by popular extensions to the South at the expense of the palm grove and without dimensional and formal logic.\nIn the end the post colonial phase characterized by the proliferation of self-built no plan to urban and architectural quality at least and without model, where typological reference, which has only to be curbed, after the instruction of the laws intervention and control of the state, over the urban space, by launching large Housing development operations in the framework of ZUNH, in the form of housing communal collective or subdivision which, despite this, has not been able to resolve the demand for housing, bringing the state to promulgation, other laws havingobjective, improving urban quality, openness and diversification stakeholders.\nToday, the city of Biskra is made up of 28 neighborhoods including 3 main ones which are, Korra, City 60 Logts ENICAB and Equipment Zones.\n\nClimate\nBiskra has a subtropical hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) typical of the region in which it is found.

      "content": "Biskra (anciennement Vescera à l'époque romaine puis Biscra, en arabe : بسكرة, en tamazight : ⴱⵉⵙⴽⵔⴰ) est une commune du Nord-est du Sahara algérien, chef-lieu de la wilaya de Biskra, située à 400 km environ au sud-est d'Alger.\nCapitale des Zibans et premier pôle urbain saharien, la ville comptait 205 608 habitants en 2008 et se place au 10e rang au niveau national. Elle est située sur un point stratégique, car elle est la porte du désert du Sahara.\nLa ville est entourée par les monts du Zab. L'activité agricole est très présente, notamment pour la culture des dattes. Localisée au début du désert du Sahara, Biskra possède un climat désertique chaud.\n\nToponymie\nLe toponyme « Biskra » vient du nom de la ville romaine de Vescera, qui serait selon une première hypothèse, d'origine phénicienne, bien qu'aucune présence carthaginoise sur les lieux ne vient confirmer, et selon une deuxième hypothèse, d'origine latine, ayant le sens de « station ». Vescera/ Bescera serait également le nom d'une tribu sédentarisée du Zab et transformée en communauté civique à l’époque romaine\nPlus probablement, Vescera, prononcé [weskera], dériverait du verbe berbère wesker ou esker, signifiant en touareg « être bien établi sur sa base », « être bien fait » ou en kabyle « être moyen », « être plutôt bon », « faire », ou dériverait du mot en tamazight du Maroc central taskart (pluriel taskarin) signifiant « petite plaine » ou « petit terrain plat ».\n\nGéographie\nSituation\nSituée au nord du Sahara algérien, au pied du massif de l'Aurès et des monts du Zab, Biskra est surnommée la « reine des Zibans », « porte du désert ». Elle est la porte orientale du Sahara algérien.\nLa ville se situe à 123 km au sud-ouest de Batna, à 388 km au nord de Ouargla, à 242 de Constantine, à 331 de Skikda, à 332 de Tébessa et à 425 au sud-est d'Alger.\nCapitale des Ziban, elle occupe une position centrale dans cette région, entre le Zab Rharbi (secteur de Tolga) à l'ouest, une région agricole prospère et le Zab Chergui (secteur de Sidi Okba).\n\nRelief et hydrographie\nElle est située une altitude de 120 m, ce qui fait d'elle une des villes les plus basses d'Algérie ; elle est au pied du col de Sfa (258 m) dans les monts du Zab, à seulement 7 km au nord de la ville, au débouché d’une large dépression qui s’ouvre entre le massif de l’Aurès et l’Atlas saharien occidental.\nLa ville de Biskra est traversée par l'oued Biskra qui prend sa source dans les Aurès et se jette dans le chott Melrhir, après un parcours d'environ 194km. L'oued est habituellement à sec à Biskra, l'apport propre à chaque crue peut rester relativement faible.\n\nLocalités de la commune\nLors du découpage administratif de 1984, la commune de Biskra est composée à partir des localités et lieux-dits suivants :\n\nTransports\nLa ville de Biskra est desservie :\n\npar l'aéroport international de Biskra - Mohamed Khider, relié par des vols réguliers à l'étranger ;\npar une ligne ferroviaire la reliant à Skikda et à Touggourt ;\nun tramway est en phase d'étude ;\npar la gare routière SNTV qui se trouve à 11 km du centre-ville ce qui fait 17 minutes en voiture.\n\nClimat\nBiskra a un climat désertique chaud (classification de Köppen BWh) typique de la région dans laquelle elle se trouve. La ville possède des étés longs et extrêmement chauds et des hivers doux. La température annuelle moyenne est de 21,8 °C.\nLe climat y est très aride et la plupart du temps très clair. Les précipitations sont limitées à seulement 128,8 mm par an. Les précipitations sont assez rares malgré quelques averses enregistrées généralement durant les mois les plus froids, principalement novembre. Les chaleurs extrêmes qui règnent durant l'été peuvent causer de violents orages à la fin de celui-ci, qui se produisent généralement en septembre, lorsque le taux d'humidité de l'air devient nettement plus élevé, le taux moyen annuel est 41 % d'humidité. Le mois avec le taux le plus haut à Biskra est décembre avec 59 % d'humidité, juillet est le mois le moins lourd avec seulement 27 % en moyenne par an.\nHormis les précipitations ou l'humidité, les vents sont fréquents durant deux périodes de l'année : vents relativement humides  pendant l'hiver, et vents de sable pendant le printemps.\n\nVégétation\nLe couvert végétal est très limité. Les espèces recensées sont généralement cultivées : eucalyptus, acacia, frêne, caroubier, palmier, olivier de Bohème, laurier-rose, tamarix, qui se trouvent au niveau des jardins publics. Des arbres d'alignement (Ficus retusa et acacia) se trouvent également au niveau de quelques artères.\n\nHistoire\nPériode antique\nLes traces de présence humaine dans la région de Biskra, remontent approximativement à 1 000 ans avant J.-C. Biskra et la région des Ziban, alors nommée la « Gétule », faisaient partie de l'empire numide proclamé par Massinissa.\nLes Romains ont établi dans la région une ville fortifiée, appelée Vescera, chargée de surveiller les Aurès. La ville est née de la sédentarisation de la tribu de Vescera/ Bescera. Elle est aussi appelée Ad Piscinam, en référence à une source (Hammam Essalihine).\nL'oasis de Biskra constitua une étape sur les parcours commerciaux nord-sud depuis l'Antiquité et, sous l'Empire romain, un des points des limes délimitant l'Empire au sud. Vescera s'est développée et devient durant la période chrétienne, le siège d'un évêché, celui de Bescera. Le nom des Besceri est identifiable avec la tribu gélule des Misiciri. Au Ve siècle, les Vandales, qui s'en emparent, exilent son évêque, Optat de Vescera.\n\nPériode musulmane\nPendant l'ère musulmane, la ville est le siège de Koceïla qui est le commandant des Awerbas et avaient également le pouvoir avec les Chaouis et les Zénètes. Et après ce litige, la ville sera sous le contrôle des Omeyyades[réf. à confirmer].\nLe conquérant arabe Oqba ibn Nafi est mort dans les environs de la ville. Une mosquée sera érigée à l'endroit de son décès et elle portera son nom (la mosquée de Sidi Okba). Le rayonnement commercial et culturel de Biskra continuait de s'affirmer avec la conquête musulmane. Au début de la période islamique, la région du Zab connaît la diffusion du courant ibadite.\nDès le IXe siècle, Biskra devient un centre important grâce au commerce saharien. Elle supplante Tobna et devient le centre actif d'une province et la concurrente directe de Sedrata. La ville est gérée par un conseil administratif au sein duquel siègent les représentants des principales familles. Après les Fatimides, Biskra et sa région passèrent ensuite sous le contrôle des Hammadides. Sous les Hammadides, elle est autonome avec un conseil de cheikh où deux familles se disputent la prééminence: les Banou Rummān et les Banou Sindi.\nL'arrivée des Arabes hilaliens au XIe siècle, provoque la formation d'une nouvelle carte socio-religieuse dans la région et contribue à arabiser les autochtones. Ils occupent les lieux puis les Almohades vont les en chasser au début du XIIe siècle et y imposer leur domination. C'est à cette époque qu'elle supplante Tobna et définitivement Tabouda.\n\nAu XIe siècle, Al-Bakri qui décrit son bel aspect et sa prospérité, ses remparts et la richesse de son oasis, écrit que les habitants de Biskra sont des convertis au malikisme et que sa région était peuplée de Berbères Sadrâta et Maghraouas, et le mentionne comme une étape nécessaire de la route d'Oran à Kairouan. Au XIIe siècle, Al Idrissi situe Biskra sur eux grands axes, le premier Est-ouest et le second nord-sud, de Bougie à Tobna.\nBiskra était reliée aux réseaux juridiques et son apparition dans le corpus juridique malikite de la fin du Moyen Âge marque la disparition totale de l'ibâḍisme du Zâb. C'est à la fin du XIIIe siècle que Biskra est dotée d'une citadelle. Au XIVe siècle, elle atteint son apogée politique mais aussi économique. On y reçoit les ambassadeurs du Mali pour traiter des affaires, et ce, malgré la concurrence de Ouargla et Touggourt.\nBiskra s'impose au XIVe siècle comme la véritable capitale du Zab, sous la famille des Béni Mozni, qui s'appuyaient tour à tour sur les différentes dynasties du Maghreb et les tribus nomades du Sahara pour imposer leur hégémonie. En effet, elle devient la capitale d’une principauté pratiquement indépendante et prospère. Les Béni Mozni s'allient aux souverains de Béjaïa, de Tlemcen ou de Fès.\nÀ la fin du XVe siècle, Biskra et le Zab deviennent le fief des nomades arabes Dawāwida. La ville fut occupée par les Turcs au XVIe siècle, à la suite des deux expéditions de Hassan Agha en 1542 et de Salah Raïs en 1552, viennent y établir une garnison et y construire un fort.\n\nLe beylik de l'Est s'appuie sur Biskra pour s'assurer le contrôle de la région. Hassan Agha donne à Ali Bou Akkaz, le titre de Cheikh El Arab avec le commandement des tribus du Zab. Pendant toute l'époque ottomane, la ville et les Ziban étaient dominés par deux grandes familles, les Benganah et les Bouakkaz, qui s'y disputaient le pouvoir. En 1680, une épidémie de peste provoque le décès de 7 000 personnes. Des Biskris vivaient dans l'agglomération algéroise, notamment dans les gourbis de Bab-Azzoun, et occupaient des métiers tels que ceux de portefaix, d'agent de police ou de vidangeur.\n\nLa période coloniale\nBiskra est occupée par le duc d'Aumale le 4 mars 1844. À l'arrivée des Français, Ahmed Bel Hadj, le représentant d'Abdelkader  dans l'oasis, s'était replié avec ses hommes. Les habitants se révoltent ; dès 1844, la garnison française est massacrée. L'émir Abd El-Kader dirige tout le Zab. Le mouvement va s'étendre à la région des Zaatchas. Les Zaatchas se révoltent sous la direction du cheikh Bouziane. Une « ville française » se développe à côté de la « ville arabe ».\nLes Ben Gana sont restés la famille la plus influente et ont occupé la plupart des postes de commandement de la région. Quelques Juifs vivaient dans la ville vers 1960. La plupart de ses membres étaient originaires de la ville ou de ses environs : Ouled Djellal, Tolga, Sidi Okba ou El Oued. Certains vivaient de la même manière que les musulmans, et certains étaient aussi agriculteurs, producteurs de dattes, notamment dans l'oasis de Gharta. La nouvelle synagogue construite dans les années 1950 fut changée en chambre de commerce lors de l'indépendance.\nDans le cadre de l'organisation du Front de libération nationale, Biskra fait d'abord partie de la Zone 1 (Aurès) sous la direction de Mostefa Ben Boulaïd ; à partir du congrès de la Soummam (août 1956), elle relève de la Wilaya VI (Sahara). Dans la nuit du 31 octobre au 1er novembre 1954, le poste de police de Biskra  est attaqué, ce qui marque le début de la guerre d'Algérie. La région joua un rôle important sous la conduite du colonel Si El Haouès.\n\nAdministration\nBiskra jouit d'un triple statut administratif. Elle est chef-lieu de wilaya et capitale micro-régionale des Zibans. Après l'indépendance, elle était chef-lieu de daïra des Aurès, jusqu'en 1974. Elle constitue l'élément majeur de l'organisation de l'espace wilayal. Par la concentration de l'administration centrale, des établissements financiers, des sièges de sociétés nationales, des directions générales, des entreprises publiques et privées, et des commerces, elle constitue le relais économique et administratif de l'influence nationale sur l'ensemble du territoire wilayal.\nDurant la période coloniale, la « ville arabe » devient une « commune indigène », administrée par les officiers des Affaires indigènes ; elle inclut alors les postes de T'Kout et d'Ouled Djellal. La « ville française » et les alentours de Biskra (80 km2) sont érigés en commune mixte par arrêté du 6 novembre 1868 puis en commune de plein exercice par décret du 22 mai 1878. Elle est rattachée à l'arrondissement de Batna (département de Constantine). T'kout est alors rattaché à la commune mixte de l'Aurès (chef-lieu : Arris). Par décret du 12 décembre 1905, le reste de la « commune indigène » est rattaché territoire de Touggourt. Une base aérienne (BA 212, actuel aéroport Mohamed Khider) s'y installe vers 1920. Par arrêté du 26 avril 1933, la « commune indigène » devient une commune mixte.\nEn 1956, Batna devient une préfecture et Biskra une sous-préfecture du département de Batna (ou : « de l'Aurès ») ; la commune mixte intègre l'arrondissement de Biskra et les anciens douars deviennent des communes.\n\nDémographie\nSelon le recensement général de la population et de l'habitat de 2008, la population de la commune de Biskra est évaluée à 205 608 habitants, dont 204 661 habitants dans l'agglomération urbaine. Elle est la première agglomération urbaine du Sahara algérien et la dixième du pays.\nL'attractivité de l'agglomération de Biskra s'inscrit spatialement sur l'Est algérien d'Illizi à Skikda. La commune ne dispose pas d'agglomération secondaire. Elle se compose d'une grosse agglomération chef-lieu et d'une zone éparse.\nEn 1987, la ville comptait 128 000 habitants, elle avait subi les retombées de l’exode rural qui a fait augmenter la population de l'ordre de 62% par rapport à celle, estimée en 1977; ces populations, nés hors de la ville, sont originaires des Zibans essentiellement.\nLa ville de Biskra était la seule ville, dans les années 1950, de tout le Sahara qui comptait plus de 50 000 habitants.\n\nUrbanisme\nRéputée pour sa palmeraie, Biskra semble avoir depuis longtemps rompu avec son statut oasien. En effet, elle s'est développée à l'époque coloniale au tracé en damier. Les faubourgs algériens, populaires et denses, se sont constitués sur sa frange sud, coincés entre noyau colonial et palmeraie. L'urbanisme est désormais, similaire à celui du Nord du pays, peu adapté à une région aride.\nLa véritable urbanisation de la ville commence avec la conquête musulmane. Le premier noyau urbain à l'intérieur de la palmeraie au sud de la ville actuelle remonte à la période ottomane, les Turcs édifièrent un fort avec trois portes : Bab El Dharb, Bab El Feth et Bab El Mekbra. Durant la seconde moitié du XVIIe siècle, une épidémie de peste ravage la ville et conduit à l'abandon du site initial et la création de nouveaux ksour à l'intérieur de la palmeraie. Ces sept pôles de peuplement représentent les sept vieux quartiers de l'agglomération de Biskra. Ils sont répartis sur un tracé régulier linéaire : Guedacha, Medjniche, Ras El Gueria, Mcid, Bab El Dharb, Bab El Feth et Sidi Barkat.\n\nL'avènement de la colonisation française de l'Algérie en 1830, apporte une rupture à la fois sociale et spatiale dans le tissu urbain de la ville . Une ville coloniale voit le jour, située au nord de la palmeraie formalisant ainsi la ségrégation des populations algériennes ( indigènes) et Européens. Au sud de cette nouvelle ville, émergèrent des quartiers d'habitat destinés aux autochtones attirés par les activités économiques de la ville. Le plan de Constantine, en plein Guerre d'Algérie apporte son lot de programmes de logements sociaux au profit des populations algériennes avec l’édification de grands ensembles .\nAprès l'indépendance de l'Algérie, la croissance urbaine de Biskra s'est faite en tache d'huile. L'urbanisation accélérée a permis l'articulation entre la vieille ville et la ville coloniale. Mais ces espaces étaient limités. Dans un premier temps, l'urbanisation s'est poursuivie vers l'ouest et a franchi la voie ferrée. Puis, la topographie limitant vite les possibilités dans cette direction; une extension de l'urbanisation de la ville s'est orientée vers l'oued Biskra ou la construction de trois ponts qui enjambent l'oued, ont permis d'englober la banlieue de Chetma, à sept kilomètres à l'est dans l'agglomération de Biskra.\n\nCulture et patrimoine\nPatrimoine\nBiskra est une ville ancienne, bien que les vestiges historiques sont peu nombreux. Les ruines des thermes de la ville romaine sont encore visibles sur la rive gauche de l'oued Biskra.\nIl subsiste le fort turc sur la colline au nord et le mausolée Sidi Zarzour sur un rocher au milieu de l'oued. Les sept villages pré-coloniaux, linéaires, sont entièrement insérés dans la palmeraie.\nLa ville abrite plusieurs édifices datant de l'époque coloniale française : le siège de l'ancienne mairie ; l'hôtel du Sahara construit en terre en 1851, premier hôtel de Biskra ; l'hôtel Victoria ; l'hôtel de l'Europe ; l'hôtel Transatlantique, restauré et non classé ; dar Bengana ; dar El-Bey ; maison Caseneuve ; maison Crespin ; maison de Clara Sheridan ; école des Allées et café André-Gide.\nÀ proximité, le conquérant arabe Oqba Ibn Nafaa est enterré sous la coupole de la vieille mosquée qui porte son nom. Cette mosquée passe pour être l'une des plus anciennes d'Algérie.\n\nGastronomie\nLa cuisine de Biskra se compose de nombreux plats, dont le mhajeb dit localement Mahdjouba, la Dobara ou la Chakhchoukha.\n\nLangues\nSituée dans la périphérie des Aurès, Biskra est une ville arabophone, mais il existe une minorité berbérophone. Le chaoui est ainsi parlé par les « djebailis »: population venue s'installer dans la ville à la suite de l'exode rural. Depuis les années 1980, marquées par le printemps berbère, il y a eu un réveil identitaire amazigh dans la région qui se traduit par la promotion du parler chaoui chez les Djebailis.\n\nMusique\nUn centre consacré aux grandes traditions musicales qui se sont maintenues à Biskra, a été ouvert. Il inclut les praticiens de plusieurs styles : la musique diwane, les sonneurs de cornemuses, les joueurs de gasbas et les ensembles de chants religieux soufis.\nLa musique diwane est une musique traditionnelle pratiquée par les populations d'origine africaine, qui a connu un dynamise ces dernières décennies. Le diwân de Biskra utilise un instrument qui lui est exclusif, le qouretou, une petite percussion. D'autres musiques sont pratiquées : le chant bédouin (aiyai), le raï ainsi que la musique chaouie et le malouf.\n\nMusées\nLa ville abrite un musée consacré à la Guerre d'Algérie et notamment à la Wilaya VI historique, baptisé Mohamed Chaâbani en 2009.\n\nFêtes\nDe nombreuses fêtes y sont célébrées, soit religieuses ou culturelles, comme l'Aïd al-Adha, l'Aïd el-Fitr, Yennayer (le nouvel an berbère), la fête des dattes en novembre et la fête du printemps.\n\nÉconomie\nSecteur tertiaire\nLe secteur domine les activés économique à Biskra et occupe la majorité des actifs. Le potentiel de consommation et son statut administratif ont favorisé la prépondérance du secteur tertiaire.\nLa ville est une grande place commerciale, centre de collecte des dattes, point de redistribution des marchandises pour le Sud algérien. Ses commerçants grossistes commercent avec l'Europe, et rayonnent sur tout l'Est algérien.\n\nIndustrie\nBiskra est dotée d'une zone industrielle, située à l'ouest de la ville : filature de laine, unité de chaussures, câbles, téléphones, énergie et industries chimiques et plastiques (articles injectés, colles et adhésifs, articles à usage médical). La majorité des unités industrielles de la wilaya est concentrée au niveau de cette zone.\nLe secteur s'est développé dans les années 1980-90, grâce aux unités nationales de la câblerie et du textile (ENICAB et ELATEX). Guedila, est une marque d'eau minérale en bouteille, dont le siège social est basé dans la commune de Djemorah.\nLe Premier ministre, Abdelmalek Sellal a inauguré, en octobre 2015, une usine de production d'hypochlorite de soude et dérivés par électrolyse du sel, la cimenterie de Djemoura.\n\nAgriculture\nBiskra dispose d'une palmeraie ancienne, et importante de 100 000 palmiers. Quelques cultures maraîchères se pratiquent aujourd'hui surtout en périphérie de la ville. On trouve aussi certaines plantes dites rustiques (olivier, figuier et grenadier) réparties à travers les palmeraies. Toutefois, l'agriculture n'occupe qu'une petite minorité des actifs.\nLes dattes de certaines régions de la wilaya de Biskra notamment de Tolga, de la variété deglet nour sont exportées à l'extérieur du pays.\n\nTourisme\nLa station thermale de Hammam Salihine est située à 7 km au nord-ouest de la ville. Le Jardin des Zibans, est le plus grand parc aquatique nord-africain.\nLa ville a attiré 12 844 touristes en 2014, soit une augmentation de 60 % par rapport à 2013.\n\nVie quotidienne\nEnseignement supérieur\nL'université de Biskra est composée de six facultés et un institut.\n\nSports\nLa ville compte un club de football l'Union sportive de Biskra (USB), un club de tennis situé dans le centre-ville juste à côté la wilaya, et un club de basket-ball, le Makarem Biskra (MB Biskra).\n\nRelations internationales\nLa ville de Biskra est jumelée avec :\n\n Maubeuge (France)\n Tourcoing (France)\n Doha (Qatar)\n\nFestivals et salons\nEn mars 2012, la wilaya a accueilli le premier salon national de la commercialisation des légumes et des épices.\n\nPersonnalités liées à la commune\nAbd al-Rahman Al-Akhdari, un savant majeur de l’école malikite, mathématicien\nTayeb El Oqbi, un ouléma algérien originaire de Sidi Oqba membre de l'Association des oulémas musulmans algériens, un des plus grands réformateurs auprès de Ibn Badis\nAhmed Reda Houhou, écrivain et martyr algérien, le premier écrivain algérien à avoir fait paraître un roman en langue arabe\nAboubaker Djaber el Djazaïri, était un érudit islamique sunnite algérien.\nMohamed Khider, homme politique, militant pendant la guerre d’indépendance et membre fondateur du Comité révolutionnaire d'unité et d'action\nMohamed Chabani, combattant algérien pendant la guerre d’indépendance, il devient colonel  de la wilaya VI, puis devient colonel à la tête de la wilaya VI.\nAhmed Ben Abderrazak Hamouda, dit colonel Si El Haouès combattant durant la révolution algérienne.

A very important thing you need to be alert to is the risk of getting scammed. When people find out that you’re a tourist they will try to increase the bills, even in hotels or motels. Taxi drivers will also charge a high price. So try to look less like a tourist and don’t show a large amount of cash or wear expensive accessories. Hide your valuables.\n\n## Stay healthy\nAs with Algeria in general, medical staff are decent and very well educated, but the public hospitals are usually basic. If you get ill, try to get to a private clinic — these are better-equipped and more modern - charges are modest by European standards.\n\n## Respect\nAs in all of North Africa, the dominant religion in Algeria is Islam, and appropriate religious prohibitions and attitudes should be in order. If visiting a mosque, for example, be sure to be dressed conservatively and remove your shoes before entering. Drinking alcohol in Biskra isn’t illegal, but it’s disliked. So make sure to drink alcohol only in bars or restaurants or at your residence.",
