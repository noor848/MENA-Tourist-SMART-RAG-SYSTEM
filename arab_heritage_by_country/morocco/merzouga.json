      "content": "Merzouga (Berber languages: ⵎⵔⵣⵓⴳⴰ, Arabic: مرزوقة) is a village in southeastern Morocco. The village is near the Erg Chebbi dunes, one of the tallest in the Sahara. It  is about 35 km (22 mi) southeast of Rissani, about 55 km (34 mi) from Erfoud and about 50 km (31 mi) from the Algerian border. Some of the other villages near the dunes are Hassilabied (4 km (2.5 mi) away), Tanamoust (3 km (1.9 mi) away), Takoujt (1.5 km (0.93 mi) away), Khamlia (7 km (4.3 mi) away), and Tisserdmine (15 km (9.3 mi) away). Rissani is the closest city of significant size, at 41.9 km away. (26 mi).\n\nHistory\nApproximately 9,000 to 10,000 years ago, the region was likely a tropical jungle, coinciding with a period when the Sahara Desert was characterized by abundant vegetation and lakes.\nMerzouga was an uninhabited oasis that later became a transit point for merchants heading to Timbuktu. It also became a pilgrimage destination for the nomads of the Ait Atta tribes and eventually a tourist destination.\nDuring French colonial rule, fortifications were built by troops of the French Foreign Legion after the battles of Taflalet, which occurred between 1916 and 1932.\nOn 26 May 2006, during the night, Merzouga experienced flash floods that caused severe damage to buildings, cars, and the traditional irrigation system. The flood left 1,200 people displaced and three dead. Animals also died in their collapsed stables.\n\"The flood damages were significant, with the destruction of 140 houses and hotels, deterioration of Taouz– Merzouga road and of the ONEP (National Agency for drinking water and sanitation) water supply pipe of Merzouga villages \"\nDue to climate change, extreme weather events of flooding have been more commonplace. In 2024, the seasonal Yasmina Lake re-formed.\n\nGallery\nEnvironmental concerns\nMerzouga faces several environmental challenges, particularly related to tourism and waste management. The increase in visitors has led to concerns about littering in the dunes and improper waste disposal, which impacts the region's fragile ecosystem. Local authorities have taken measures to regulate tourism activities, including closing unlicensed desert camps in 2019 due to concerns over waste disposal, water usage, and infrastructure sustainability. These closures sparked debate among local communities, as tourism is a significant part of the area's economy.\nThe region has also experienced rare environmental events, such as unexpected flooding. In October 2024, heavy rainfall led to the formation of temporary lakes in normally dry areas, a phenomenon not observed in decades.\n\nSee also\nSahara\nSahara desert\nAfrican humid period\nMorocco\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Merzouga at Wikimedia Commons",

      "content": "## Overview\nMerzouga is a village in the Sahara Desert in Morocco, on the edge of Erg Chebbi, a 50-km long and 5-km wide set of sand dunes that reach up to 350 m above the plain and 808 m above sea level.\n\n## Understand\nMost visitors come here to take a camel safari into the dunes, and to get a taste of remote (but certainly tourism-influenced) Berber life.\nThe local population is mix of Arabs and Berber, which are generally welcoming and friendly. Although especially in and around Merzouga far more than usual people will display a touting behaviour and try you to sell a tour or a place to stay.\nIn general, it needs to be remembered that the dunes barely present an authentic Moroccan landscape. Many tourists come here, ride the camel and bring pictures back home, making people believe that this is what the desert looks like south. However, riding a camel through the dunes and staying in a tent there is nothing authentic about it—it is a touristy facade. Having said that the region is nevertheless beautiful and interesting, and even the regular stony desert is impressing in itself.\n\n## By plane\nAirports around with international flights are in Fez and Marrakech. From there you can take an intercity bus to Merzouga.\nFrom Casablanca you can fly to Ouarzazate, then continue to Erfoud, Rissani and Merzouga.\nThere are also weekly flights into Errachidia, about 2 hours north of Merzouga by car.\n\n## By bus\n31.096531-4.0104831 Supratours office & stop. Bus to Marrakech at 07:30. Bus to Fez at 22:30. 160 dirham.    (updated Apr 2019)\nSupratours buses from Marrakech and also from Fez have one daily trip each that end in Merzouga village, for 160 dirham. CTM only goes up until Erfoud and Rissani.\n\n## By grand taxi\nFrom Rissani to Merzouga, a grand taxi or van is 12-15 dirham and goes about every 30 min. If you don't want to wait for other people to fill your grand taxi, pay 60 dirham. If you arrive before sunrise (if you come in the 06:00-07:00 bus from Fez) you might have to pay up to 100 dirham for a grand taxi.\nFrom Erfoud to Merzouga, a grand taxi is 25 dirham, every 1-2 hr.\nIf you're continuing on to one of the small villages nearby, such as Hassi Labied, the usual tourist price is a fairly steep 50 dirham (total, not per person) for the 5-km drive. Beware that overnight buses may sometimes arrive more than an hour early, putting you in Merzouga before sunrise. If this happens, you may find yourself with no cabs available, so be prepared to wait for someone to arrive.\nBeware of guides in Rissani or Erfoud who offer to take you to Merzouga for 5 dirham each, but instead strand you at their auberge 20 km north of the village. If you decline their offers of camel rides and lodging, it is often quite difficult (and expensive) to make your way back to town.\n\n## By car\nFrom Marrakech, drive east to Erfoud (2 days drive, stop for the night in or near Ouarzazate). From Fez, drive south to Erfoud (1 day).\nFrom Erfoud, continue south 14 km to Rissani, carry on through the village and follow the road southeast for 40 km to Merzouga. The road has been asphalted to Merzouga, and also to Taouz, a southern military border town (foreigners cannot cross here). The short access roads (1- or 2-km long) from the main road to the hotels alongside the sand dunes are normally not asphalted, but well maintained. There is now an asphalt road to Hassi Lybed, a smaller village about 4 km before Merzouga.\n\n## By tour\nTour operators can arrange 4x4s with driver/guides from Marrakech or Casablanca and back.\n\n## Get around\nThe only way to get around Merzouga is on foot. It's fairly small and easily walkable, but you'll likely want to avoid the midday heat.\n\n## See\nSunrise/sunset over the dunes. Folk dances and black G'naui music. Visits to villages near Merzouga inhabited by Senegalese musicians and dancers such as Khamlia can be arranged with some guides, ask at your hotel.\nAnimals – See the ducks, and in early spring, flamingos, on the Dayet Srji salt lake, just west of Merzouga (according to the visitor information office in Hassilabied, there has been no water for at least the past 2 years, as of May 2018). There are many other species of birds (ruddy sheldrack and Kittllitz's plower during the spring migration, Tristram's desert warbler, the Egyptian nightjar, the Arabian buzzard and falcons), and the desert sparrows are unique to this region and can be seen all year round. There are also reptiles (Algerian sand lizards, Berber skinks and snakes), mammals such as gerbils, desert hedgehogs, field mice and desert foxes, and scarab beetles. In the morning, you can often see their tracks in the sand. Brown scorpions can occasionally be seen, but they come out at night and tend to avoid humans.\n\n## Do\n31.077663-3.9902911 Grand Dune. Hike the dune    (updated Apr 2019)\nSunset on the dune. Even though there is not a single liquor store around to buy a decent wine for such a great show and view, it is still worth sitting on the Grand Dune and watching the surrounding area and sun set. (updated Apr 2019)\nCamp on the dune. Instead of dropping hundreds of dirham for a remote camping experience with an all so fake looking headscarf, why not just stay on top of the dunes yourself after the sun has set? Bring a sleeping bag, the sand is quite soft. Also, bring water and leave nothing but footprint. (updated Apr 2019)\nHike the desert. From where Merzouga ends in the south it is basically just 5 km straight across the dune from west to east to reach the other side of the dune. If you feel bored, simply hike over to the other side, north by the Grand Dune, visit the setup camps on the other side and head back afterwards. Bring enough water! (updated Apr 2019)\nBoarding the dunes. This does not seem to have become a trend yet. Nevertheless, some accommodations have skiers for rent, try Dar Gamra. Otherwise, maybe you are lucky and find a snowboard. Or, a relative strong and smooth plastic \"slide\" that you can properly hold fix with your hands does the trick while going down the dune. Head for the Grand Dune with the steepest and highest slopes. (updated Apr 2019)\n\n## Tours\nTour prices are highly negotiable, try 25% less than quoted and use the walking out trick. There is always more than enough companies. And always negotiate with the company directly, not through your accommodation or any arbitrary tout from the street.\nATV & quad bikes. It is also possible to tour the dunes on ATVs. However, it is not as much fun as it might sound at first. You are basically following a guide and can not go bananas with your rented quad. If the latter is more of you taste, try to find a regular ATV rental and go on your own from there. On the way towards Merzouga there seem to be some regular rentals.Many tourist that come here with their own or rented motorbikes or 4WD go right into the dunes for a little fun. Some discourage this touring, but touring the dunes on a camel is neither more authentic nor worth more protection. From 400 dirham pp for a tour incl. guide (negotiable). (updated Apr 2019)\n4WD region tour. A 2 hour drive that includes a ride with a 4WD onto the dunes, visit to a local village (and probably shop of a cousin), and a visit of the Dayet Srij lake with the impressive dunes in the back. 800 dirham per 2 hr (negotiable). (updated Apr 2019)\nMoorish tour (travel agency), ☏ +212719081882, moorishtour@gmail.com. Moorish Tour – A local tour company based in Merzouga. They offer camel rides, desert camping, and guided tours to explore the Sahara and nearby villages. The team is friendly and knows the area well. You can choose short trips or longer tours, and they can also help plan a custom experience based on what you want to see. Great for learning about Berber culture and enjoying the desert. (updated May 2025)\n\n## Camel Safaris\nAlmost certainly the reason you came here in the first place. After taking you into the village to buy a proper head scarf (of course from their cousin for a special price) to protect you from the sun, you'll be thrown on a camel and lead off into the desert. (Good luck with your knees.) Meals, water, tents, etc should all be taken care of by your leader, but naturally you will have to confirm this when you do your negotiations beforehand and make sure you're very specific, and ask lots of questions. Speaking of negotiations, do your research before coming (ask other travelers in Marrakech, etc., for recommendations and for what they paid), and be prepared to bargain very hard(!)—the industry here is smooth and deceivingly vicious. On the first night, most groups end up at a pre-setup camp circle at the base of some large dunes, where the various tour operators have their \"authentic\" Berber tents set up. Dinner will be cooked here, often some music played, and you can frolic on the sand dunes under zillions of stars. If you're only on a 1-day trip, then you'll wake early, have some tea/breakfast, and head back before it gets hot. Others will hang out during the day, beating the heat in the tents all day, and either spend another night here or venture further out beyond the dunes and stay with a Berber family, where you'll then set out to return early on the third morning. A few operators have their own private camps that will offer a more remote experience, ask around if this is what you seek. This provides a more intimate setting with fewer people and noise where you can relax and enjoy the stars. Cost a little bit more but worth it. Also check to see if showers are included after the camel trek.\n\n## Money\nThere is apparently just 31.099253-4.0167941 one ATM at the north entrance of Merzouga, which might not be very reliable. It is better to stack up cash in Erfoud or Rissani.\n\n## Eat\nMost people eat meals at their lodge, but a few basic restaurants are scattered around the town if you are in need.\nHaven La Chance, Hassi Labaid, ☏ +212 66859-9340. Arrange lunches at Haven La Chance Desert Hotel, either at the hotel or in the desert itself. A popular item is pizza cooked in the sand as the nomads do.\n\n## Stay healthy\nFor prepared food try to prefer places with enough customers. This is the desert and hygiene standards are lower than in the rest of Morocco.\n\n## Camping\nJust head into the dunes and get a place on top of a dune or somewhere close to a tree to be safe from any vehicles. Even though at night probably no one is driving around, because it is too dangerous getting stuck. The desert here is relatively warm at night but a proper sleeping bag is necessary. Check the weather forecast for the temperatures.\n\n## Merzouga\nJust near the village there are many small to larger estates made of mud which have decent rooms, running water, WiFi and breakfast available for prices starting from 170-300 dirham for a double.\n31.093682-4.0067961 Dar Gamra (Family Morrocon House). A decent house, rated pretty well. The owner is relaxed and not too pressuring about selling you anything and you could just stay around, use that WiFi and wait for the heat to vanish in the afternoon. They apparently also have their own camel tour. Double from 170 dirham.

Be sure not to fall for any guy that has nothing to do with the actual tour, operator or accommodation.\n\n## Romantic liaisons\nAs with many places, be cautious with anyone who seems interested in romantic entanglements, as incidents of foreign women being charmed by locals and then discovering that the \"romance\" was merely a cover to obtain sex, money, or other services are not uncommon and increasing. This seems especially true for young foreign travellers. The cosy camp surroundings and maybe some wine does the rest.\n\n## Go next\nSupratours buses travel from the center of Merzouga village north to Meknes, Fez and also over to Ouarzazate and then Marrakech. This is new and an affordable way to get in and out the desert. But there are no stops to visit the Todra Gorge, Dades valley or Ait Ben Haddaou or Ifrane. Or to take rest stops at your leisure! They travel overnight from Fez and during the day from Marrakech.",
