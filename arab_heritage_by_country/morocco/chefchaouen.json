      "content": "Chefchaouen (Arabic: شفشاون, romanized: Shafshāwan, IPA: [ʃafˈʃaːwan]) is a city in northwest Morocco. It is the chief town of the province of the same name and is noted for its buildings in shades of blue, for which it is nicknamed the \"Blue City\". It is situated in a mountainous region in northern Morocco, between Tétouan and Ouazzane.\nIt was founded in 1471 by the Moulay Ali Ben Rachid, a distant descendant of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. The original settlement consisted of just a small fortress, now referred to as Chefchaouen’s Kasbah. The fortress was erected to help defend the area from potential attacks by Portuguese invaders; at the time, Portugal was launching attacks against northern cities and towns in Morocco.\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"Chefchaouen\" is of Arabic and Berber origin coming from \"Chef” (Arabic: شاف, romanized: shāf), a derivation of the Arabic word “to look”, and the Berber term “Echaouen\", meaning “antlers” or “horns” and is a term used to indicate the peak of mountains. Chefchaouen thus means 'look at the horns', referring to the two mountain peaks overlooking the area. Nowadays, Chefchaouen is known as \"the Blue Pearl\" of Morocco, known for its traditional houses painted in blue and white.\n\nHistory\nThe city was founded in 1471 (876 AH) as a small Kasbah by Ali ibn Rashid al-Alami, a descendant of Abd al-Salam ibn Mashish al-Alami and Idris I. Al-Alami built the Kasbah to defend against Portuguese invasions of northern Morocco. Along with the Ghomaras of the region, many Andalusi Muslims, Moriscos and Spanish and Portuguese Jews settled here during and after the Reconquista, when Spanish Christians conquered what remained of al-Andalus, the Muslim-controlled parts of the Iberian Peninsula.\nAli Ben Rashid was born in Gherzoim, a nearby village, c. 1440 (844 AH). He went to Emirate of Granada in 1460 and distinguished himself in battle against Christian forces. He settled in Chefchaouen c. 1465 and, due to his experience as a warrior, was chosen as successor to his cousin ibn Abi Jum'ah and leader of the mujahideen in the northwest of Morocco. He fought alongside the emir of Tétouan, Ali al-Mandri, who married his daughter, the Mujahida Aisha al-Hurra. The latter, known by her title, Sayyida al-Hurra, ruled Chefchaouen through a rapid period of growth and development.\nPressures of the Reconquista and the fall of Granada in 1492 led many of its people to immigrate to Morocco over several centuries. The last Moriscos (descendants of Muslims) were expelled from Spain by Philip III in 1609. Some of these refugees chose to settle in the large cities of Fes, Marrakesh, Tlemcen, Tunis, and Kairouan, while others settled in the jihadist fortress of Chefchaouen, which was in a fierce war against Portuguese armies. They established their quarters on the rugged slopes of the mountains and built their own residential quarters in the Andalusi architectural style, very similar to the traditional quarters of Granada. In a few decades, the fortress of Chefchaouen turned into a prosperous new city, in which the Andalusi-Granadan culture merged with the culture of the Ghomaras. The urban expansion included military fortifications such as walls with about ten gates and the construction of several mosques including the Great Mosque. The Andalusi community that settled in the city also included several well-known poets and philosophers.\nIn October 1920, General Dámaso Berenguer occupied the city for the Spanish protectorate in Morocco. Following the Spanish retreat from the city, Chefchaouen was part of the Republic of the Rif led by Abd el-Krim from 1924 to 1926. In September 1925, in the middle of the Rif War, a rogue squadron of American volunteer pilots, the Lafayette Escadrille, bombarded civilians in the city. Colonel Charles Sweeny had proposed the idea to French Prime Minister Paul Painlevé, who \"warmly welcomed the Colonel's request.\" After el-Krim was defeated with the help of the French, he was deported to Réunion. The Spanish Army retook the city in 1926.\nMorocco gained its independence from colonial rule in 1956. Chefchaouen and most of the northern parts of the country were ceded by Spain that year.\n\nGeography\nThe city of Chefchaouen is located at about 600 metres (2,000 ft) above sea level in the foothills of the Kaʻala mountain in the western part of the Rif mountain range, in northwestern Morocco. The city consists of a Medina, the historical walled town, and a new town that has grown outside the former city walls.\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the last census of the Moroccan population (2024), the municipality of Chefchaouen had a population of 46,168.\n\nCulture\nChefchaouen is located in a territory traditionally inhabited by Jebala, subsequently joined by Muslim and Jewish refugees from al-Andalus and Spain. The city has maintained strong relations with the inhabitants of the Jbala Region such as Akhmas, Ghomara, Ghazaoua, and Sanhaja tribes, particularly in terms of trade. The federations of these tribes were sometimes a source of strength, and sometimes a weakness due to their frequent struggles to take possession of assets such as water sources, grazing areas, and fertile land.\nThe traditional houses of Chefchaouen were made of stone, brick, tile, wood, soil, and lime. Each house had an open yard in the center surrounded by corridors and bedrooms. The yards are often decorated with fruit trees such as oranges, lemons, berries, and grapes, as well as some perfumed shrubs including night-blooming jessamine (Cestrum nocturnum) and jasmine (Jasminum officinale). From a physiognomy perspective, the city is influenced by Andalusian architecture, such as the curved brick archways that strengthen the houses and decorate the narrow blue alleyways, the traditional water network, and the landscaping and care of plants inside houses and mosques. From a cultural perspective, many Chefchaouen families have conserved the art of Andalusian music, which has become the main ritual of Chefchaouen religious festivals and social ceremonies.\n\nThe rural landscape was characterized by a distribution of space according to intra- and intertribal relations. At the level of each dshar (low-density rural settlements), the houses are built around a mosque or a marabou and occupy the center of the concentric spatial structure of traditional agro-sylvo-pastoral systems. This spatial distribution of dshars is tightly associated with arable land and availability of water resources, with shifting cultivation limited to a diffuse strip of matorral shrubland and pasture that mark the transition to forests. However, this traditional agro-salvo-pastoral system has been deeply affected by multiple processes of modern socio-cultural and economic transformation.\n\nTraditions\nChefchaouen's residents commit to religious and social rituals. The devout perform prayer together in the mosque or the zawiya (a Sufi shrine or religious complex). They also like to visit their families and friends on religious and social occasions. Some of the major religious and social occasions include:\n\nSha’banah takes place on the 15th of Shaa’ban (i.e. the 8th month of Hijri calendar). It is commonly known as the Day of Nusskhah, in which the tomb of Moulay Abd Salam Ben Mshish is visited, of particular observance by the students of msids (Quranic schools).\nThe night of Al-Qad is observed on the 26th of Ramadan, when the people encourage 7–10-year-old girls to fast. Families usually celebrate at home, but often parade following the afternoon prayer with the girls wearing wedding clothes.\nAshura is celebrated on the 10th of Muharram (observed by Jewish residents as Yom Kippur). Preparations begin after Eid Al-Adha when part of the Eid meat is dried as qaddid, and on Ashura is eaten with couscous by families, along with dried fruit (almonds, walnuts, raisins, and pistachios), dates and various traditional sweets. Children receive great attention and are often gifted traditional and modern items, including toys.\nMawlid Nabawi (Muhammad's birthday) is celebrated on the 12th of Rabii’ Al-Awwal. It is designated as Eid and involves the reading of the Quran and Muhammad's biography in mosques or at people’s homes. This night is also celebrated in the mausoleum of Ali Ben Rashid and the 13 zawiyas throughout the city. Couscous is served to the poor and prisoners. During this celebration, mass circumcision of children is carried out following the afternoon prayer, and gifts are distributed to their families.\nHakouzah Day is celebrated on 1 January of the agricultural solar calendar. It is observed by preparing and eating various traditional foods, in appreciation of the past harvest's bounty and the hope that the New Year will be better.\nDespite the diversity of these ceremonies, observances of similar characters are present in almost all of Morocco.\nIn her annotated study on Storytelling in Chefchaouen Northern Morocco literary scholar Aicha Rahmouni published orally transmitted tales in Chefchaouen's form of colloquial Moroccan Arabic told by two storytellers, accompanied with transliterations and translations.\n\nEconomy\nIn 2020, Chefchaouen was included as a learning city in the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities (GNLC). This network encourages policy discussion and mutual learning between its members, to forge collaborations and develop abilities and designs tools to support and identify progress.\n\nAgricultural sector\nAgriculture is an important sector of the economy in the Chefchaouen area, which is known for its large agro-pastoral component. A traditional subsistence agriculture is practiced there on the hillsides and in the valleys – olives being the main crop. Other traditional crops such as grape vines, almonds and figs are still cultivated, although cannabis monoculture has become more profitable than these with an increased influx of tourists in recent decades.\n\nIndustry and commerce\nThe industrial sector of Chefchaouen province remains very weak despite the province's potential with its availability of human and natural resources. The commercial sector is one of the main economic supports of Chefchaouen, bolstered by tourism activity and remittances from workers abroad. It is mainly focused on urban centers and the main rural communes and is based on the sale of traditional food products, construction materials, clothing, and household items. Commercial transactions become dynamic during summer, with the influx of tourists and the return of foreign workers to the province. The Rif region around Chefchaouen is also a center of cannabis production in Morocco.\n\nTourism\nDuring the holidays, the city sees a considerable influx of Moroccan and foreign tourists, attracted by its natural landscapes and historical monuments. Tourism is largely seasonal, with 200 hotels in the province catering to an influx of European tourists in the summer. In 2018, the annual number of tourists visiting the city was estimated at 120,000. In the past, some of the city's tourism was also linked to the availability of good-quality, low-cost cannabis produced in the region. Tourism has since increased primarily due to the Medina's appeal. Authorities have also promoted the region's natural environment. A nearby attraction is the Kef Toghobeit Cave, one of the deepest caves in Africa.\n\nHandicraft sector\nThe handicraft sector or traditional industry (e.g., sewing, cupping, blacksmithing, carpentry, needlework, and tanning) is the most common economic activity practiced by Chefchaouen's population and thus plays key a socio-economic role in this province. It is closely related to the tourism sector and includes a multitude of artisans (38 cooperatives and 688 artisan adherents in 2016) largely occupied in leather, textile, ironwork, and traditional carpentry. Wood products represent the best-selling artisanal product in Chefchaouen province, with 57.6% of products sold.\n\nLandmarks\nChefchaouen's blue walls are a popular subject of interest. There are several theories as to why the walls were painted blue. One popular theory is that the blue keeps mosquitos away. The blue is said to symbolize the sky and heaven and serve as a reminder to lead a spiritual life. However, according to some locals, the walls were mandated to be painted blue in the 1970s to attract tourists.\n\nMedina\nThe Medina is the historical district of Chefchaouen, where blue and white paint dominates the walls and houses. The Medina was enclosed by defensive walls and some of its historic gates are still preserved.\n\nThe heart of the Medina is Uta Hammam Square (or Place Outa Hammam), a market square surrounded by the most important buildings of the old town – the Kasbah, the Great Mosque, and a caravanserai – as well as various shops and cafés. The square was probably created by Moulay Muhammad (one of Ali ibn Rashid's sons) in the 16th century. It takes its name from a hammam (public bathhouse) in the northwest corner.\nThe funduq (caravanserai), near the northwest corner of the square, is the largest of the four caravanserais in the city, built to house merchants and travelers. The building consists of a courtyard surrounded by a multi-story gallery and rooms. Its architecture is simple, distinguished only by its tall entrance portal with a large pointed horseshoe arch.\nTo the southwest of the Kasbah is the Souika neighbourhood, one of the oldest in the city, established since the 15th century. Its name, meaning \"Little Souk\", derives from the presence of a market (qaysariyya) created here in its earliest days. This market area was originally marked off from the surrounding district and enclosed by its own gates, of which one archway remains.\n\nA number of traditional fountains are located throughout the old city and provided water for its inhabitants. One example is the four-sided fountain at the center of the Uta Hammam Square. Its four façades are each decorated with a blind arch niche and the structure was originally topped by a dome. It has since been redecorated and repainted, with the dome replaced by a green-tiled roof. Another example is the Aïn Souika Fountain in the Souika neighborhood, an old wall fountain set behind an archway. The façade of the fountain is decorated with a blind arch framed by concentric multifoil decoration, topped by small blind windows above. A recent restoration most likely added the current tile decoration that imitates zellij.\n\nKasbah\nThe oldest part of the Medina is the Kasbah, the original citadel founded in the late 15th century by Ali ibn Rashid. The fortress consists of a roughly rectangular enclosure protected by walls built in rammed earth (pisé). The Kasbah originally had two entrances: one facing the main square and markets, another near the Great Mosque. These entrances have since been closed or repurposed and modern access is through an opening created in the 1930s.\nThe Kasbah's walls are reinforced by ten towers, also built in rammed earth, and an additional tower on the west side, built in rubble masonry reinforced with cut stone at the corners. The latter tower, which is taller and stands out from the rest, was probably built in the early 16th century by Moulay Muhammad. It has multiple rooms inside, some covered by brick domes. Its structure and function appears similar to some of the tower-residences of Nasrid architecture in Granada. Some old cisterns have been discovered on site, likely dating to the Kasbah's original construction and its early use as a residence.\nToday, the Kasbah has been converted into a museum and its interior courtyard is occupied by a garden. The museum's exhibitions are focused on archeological objects and ethnography and they are located on the ground floor of a historic house in the northeast corner of the enclosure. The house was likely built in the late 17th century during the reign of Moulay Ismail, probably by Ali Errifi, the local governor.\n\nReligious sites\nThe Great Mosque of Chefchaouen is the city's oldest and historically most important mosque, located at Place Outae Hammam at the heart of the Medina, close to the Kasbah. The Spanish Mosque is a disused mosque overlooking the town from a hill to the east. It was built by the Spanish in the 1920s and is now a popular lookout point.\nOutside the city, the Mausoleum of Abdessalam Ben Mshish al-Alami is dedicated to the patron saint of northern Morocco's Jebalah region, Moulay Abdessalam Ben Mshish al-Alami. His tomb and the village surrounding it are roughly 50 kilometres (31 mi) northwest of Chefchaouen on the old road to Larache.\n\nRas al-Ma'\nThis water source is located just east of the Medina, outside its former walls. It was the original source of water for the city. The spot where the water emerges at the surface was once open but is now enclosed by a stone structure. Nearby and downstream are located an old mill, and a bridge, possibly from the 19th century, which links the two shores of the stream.\n\nInternational relations\nA list of twin towns and sister cities includes:\n\n Issaquah, Washington, United States (since April 11, 2007)\n Vejer de la Frontera, Spain\n Ronda, Spain\n Kunming, China\n Testour, Tunisia\n Mértola, Portugal\n Beni Mellal, Morocco (domestic)\n\nNotable people\nAhmed Hammoudan, professional footballer\nAbdelkarim Tabbal, poet\nSayyida al Hurra, corsair, queen, and governor\n\nReferences and notes\n\n\n== External links ==",

      "content": "Chefchaouen ou Chaouen (en arabe : شفشاون, /ʃəfˈʃɑˑwən/ ; berbère : ⴰⵛⵛⴰⵡⴻⵏ, /ɑʃʃɑwən/) est une ville du nord-ouest du Maroc, bâtie à 600 m d'altitude au pied des monts Kelaa et Meggou, entre Tétouan et Ouazzane, sur la chaîne du Rif. Elle est le chef-lieu de la province homonyme. Sa population intra-muros est de 42 786 habitants.\nElle est mondialement célèbre pour les façades de ses bâtiments teintes de bleu et de blanc, pour lesquels elle est surnommée la « Ville bleue ». La ville a été fondée en 1471 par le chérif Moulay Ali ibn Rachid al-Alami, un lointain descendant du prophète Mahomet. La ville se composait alors d'une petite forteresse, qui constitue aujourd'hui la Kasbah de Chefchaouen. Elle a été érigée pour aider à défendre la région contre d'éventuelles attaques étrangères, essentiellement celles des Portugais qui lançaient alors des attaques contre le nord du Maroc.\nLe nom de la ville provient du berbère achawen, signifiant « les cornes », en raison des sommets montagneux qui la dominent et l'entourent.\n\nHistoire\nInitialement instiguée en 1415, Chefchaouen est fondée en 1471 puis achevée en 1480 par le chérif Ali ibn Rachid al-Alami, de retour d'un séjour guerrier dans le royaume de Grenade. La ville accueille par la suite une population composée principalement d'Andalous et de Megorachim puis de Morisques et demeure interdite aux Chrétiens sous peine de mort. Seul l'explorateur Charles de Foucauld brava l'interdit en 1883.\nEntre 1471 et 1561, la ville est gouvernée par la dynastie des Banou Rachid, descendants de son fondateur, nominalement vassaux des sultans wattassides الوطاسيين , et sera réunifiée au Maroc par les Saadiens السعديين.\nLa Grande Mosquée de Chefchaouen, El-Masjid El-Aadam, fut construite en 969 de l’hégire, 1471 de l'ère chrétienne, par le fondateur de la ville Ali ibn Rachid Alami. Cette mosquée fut chargée, outre la célébration des cultes, de l’enseignement des sciences humaines et islamiques.\nEn juillet 1883 l'explorateur français Charles de Foucauld est le premier Européen qui livre une description de la ville et de ses environs ; il souligne sa beauté pittoresque « avec son vieux donjon à tournure féodale, ses maisons couvertes de tuiles, ses ruisseaux qui serpentent de toutes parts, on se serait cru bien plutôt en face de quelque bourg paisible des bords du Rhin […] ». Grâce à lui on sait que la ville comptait alors entre trois et quatre mille habitants, parmi lesquels une dizaine de familles juives à la fin du XIXe siècle.\nEn 1920, les Espagnols s'emparent de Chefchaouen, laquelle sera ensuite bombardée par l'escadrille chérifienne, une unité de mercenaires américains souvent issus de l'escadrille La Fayette employés par l'armée française pendant la guerre du Rif, puis par les troupes de Franco. La ville ne fut rétrocédée au Maroc qu'en 1956, à la suite de l'abrogation du protectorat.\n\nGéographie\nLa ville se trouve au pied du djebel Mezedjel, avec des crêtes en forme de cornes d'où elle tire son nom. Le djebel Beni Hassan se trouve en face, de l'autre côté de la vallée, à l'ouest, il se prolonge plus au sud et prend le nom de djebel el Akhmâs.\nChefchaouen a su tirer profit de son isolement à l'abri des montagnes, suffisamment à l'écart de la côte et donc des Portugais.\n\nReligion\nLa population de Chefchaouen est musulmane de rite sunnite.\nChefchaouen compte un important patrimoine religieux : 20 mosquées et oratoires, 11 Zaouïas et 17 mausolées. Ceci lui a valu le nom de El-Madina Es-Saliha (la Ville sainte).\n\nClimat\nTourisme\nLa province dispose, dans le domaine du tourisme, de potentialités importantes et diversifiées constituées de monuments historiques, de nombreuses plages de sable et de vastes forêts avec une faune et une flore très variées. Les principaux sites touristiques de la province sont :\n\nla ville de Chefchaouen ;\nla source de Ras El Maa (à 3 km de la ville de Chefchaouen) ;\nl'ancienne médina avec la kasbah ;\nles cascades et la mosquée de Cherafat ;\nla forêt de Talassemtane ;\nla grotte de Toughoubite ;\nle pont de Dieu à Akchour\nAvec son parc national de Talassemtane de près de 59.000 hectares, Chefchaouen est considérée comme un modèle de biodiversité. Le parc abrite 100 espèces d'oiseaux et 700 espèces de plantes dont de nombreuses variétés endémiques, comme le cèdre de l'Atlas mais surtout l'Abies pinsapo Marocana entre autres.\n\nPatrimoine de l'Unesco\nLe 20 novembre 2010, avec trois autres communautés méditerranéennes dont Soria en Espagne, Coron en Grèce et Cilento en Italie, la ville de Chaouen a été inscrite sur la Liste représentative du patrimoine culturel immatériel de l’humanité de l'UNESCO. Cette inscription a été rendue possible grâce à sa pratique alimentaire emblématique du régime méditerranéen : « celle-ci se caractérise par un modèle nutritionnel demeuré constant dans le temps et dont les principaux ingrédients sont l’huile d’olive, les céréales, les fruits et légumes frais ou séchés, une proportion limitée de poisson, des produits laitiers et viande, et de nombreux condiments et épices ».\n\nClimat\nLa ville de Chefchaouen se situe à 600 m d'altitude. On distingue dans cette province trois variétés de climat :\n\nLa zone montagneuse au climat typiquement montagnard, pluvieux et froid en hiver et doux en été. Les précipitations y sont les plus importantes et varient entre 800 et 1 400 mm/an atteignant parfois 2 000 mm/an avec des chutes de neige même si celles-ci restent rares à 600 m.\nUn climat semi-aride qui domine la zone côtière avec des précipitations qui varient entre 350 et 400 mm/an.\nLa zone Sud est caractérisée par un climat humide en hiver et sec en été avec des précipitations oscillant entre 900 et 1 300 mm/an.\nL'été est parfois très chaud avec des températures atteignant ou dépassant 40 °C mais il est à noter que la région montagneuse bénéficie d'un climat tempéré caractéristique de la région du nord du Maroc et, l'hiver, il fait parfois très froid comme en 2005 avec −14 °C.\n\nJumelage et partenariats\nTestour (Tunisie)\n Kunming (Chine)\n Ronda (Espagne)\n Issaquah (États-Unis)\n Vejer de la Frontera  (Espagne)\n Dijon (France)\n\nGalerie\nRéférences\nAnnexes\nBibliographie\n: document utilisé comme source pour la rédaction de cet article.\n\nMéditerranée Maroc n° 24[réf. incomplète] \nEmma Natividad, « Le dialecte de Chefchaouen », dans Jordi Aguadé, Patrice Cressier et Ángeles Vicente (actes réunis et préparés par), Peuplement et arabisation au Maghreb occidental : Dialectologie et Histoire, Madrid, Casa de Velázquez, 1998 (ISBN 8486839858 et 9788486839857, OCLC 40820286), p. 109-120 [aperçu en ligne]\nCharles de Foucauld, Reconnaissance au Maroc, 1888, 495 p.\n\nLiens externes\n\n Portail du Maroc   Portail des Berbères",

      "content": "## Overview\nChefchaouen (شفشاون, also Chaouen, Chawen or Xaouen) is a gorgeous mountain city in northeastern Morocco.\n\n## Understand\nIt's no wonder that tourists flock here — this humble town is the embodiment of almost every Moroccan cliché. The picturesque medina, set against the dramatic backdrop of the Rif Mountains, is filled with white-washed homes with distinctive, powder-blue accents, and the call to prayer rings out of several mosques around the town in chorus. If you've got a few days to relax from the rigors of travel, this is a good place to do it.\nTourism in Chaouen is also driven by its reputation as centre of the marijuana plantations region in North Morocco. Drugs are widespread and somehow tolerated, but touts trying to sell to tourists are also very annoying.\nSpanish and French are most popular foreign languages.\n\n## By plane\nThe nearest airports are at Tangier, Fez, Rabat, and Casablanca, while some flights go to Tetouan. From these you can take intercity buses to Chefchaouen. From Casablanca it also makes sense to use the low-priced high-speed train to Tangier and continue from there.\n\n## By bus\nThere are frequent buses from Fez and Tetouan and also from Casablanca, Rabat, Meknes, Tangier, Nador, and Al Hoceima. Enjoy the sales pitches of vendors who come onto the bus while you wait for more passengers at major stops.\nApproximate bus timetable to destinations around Morocco (as of Jan 2017):\nTetouan - five CTM buses at 04:00, 14:15, 15:15, 18:30 and 20:30; 90 min. Twelve local buses at 06:45, 08:00, 08:15, 08:30, 08:45, 09:45, 11:30, 12:30, 14:45, 16:30, 17:00 and 17:30.\nTangier - four CTM buses daily, with stopover in Tetouan; 2½-3 hr. Four Nejme Chamal buses daily: 07:00, 10:00, 14:00, 15:15 and 18:00 and one local bus at 10:45.\nRabat - one CTM bus at 07:00, 4½ hr. Five local buses daily: 06:00, 07:30, 08:15, 09:15 and 12:45; 5-5½ hr.\nCasablanca - one CTM bus at 07:00 (goes to Rabat first), 6 hr. Three local buses: 06:00, 7:30 and 09:00; 6-6½ hr.\nMeknes - three buses, 06:00, 14:30 and 15:30, 4 hr. In the opposite direction buses leave Meknes at 05:00, 12:00, and 24:00. The 05:00 bus is direct while the other two buses stop in Dardara, about 8 km away from the city, so you have to take a petit taxi to Chefchaouen from there.\nFez - five CTM buses: 08:00, 11:00, 12:00, 14:15 and 23:45; 4¼ hr. These buses are often booked out days in advance. Other companies' bus departs at 07:00, 08:30, 09:30, 11:45 and 12:30.\nIf direct buses to Fez and Tetouan are not enough. There are more local buses plying the route from Fez to Tetouan/Tangier stopping at Derdara (8 km from Chefchaouen), where you can get into one of the frequent grand taxis for 5 dirham. This avoids the long uphill walk.\nBerbered and Ketama - daily buses at 08:00; 3 hr.\nFrom Ouzanne there are frequent buses, but none from El Knat el Kebir.\nCeuta - no direct buses go to Ceuta, so you'll have to first get to Tetouan, then get a city bus/grand taxi to Fnideq (town bordering Ceuta), from where either walk remaining 3 km to the border or get a shared cab (5 dirham).\n35.16762-5.274831 Bus station (Gare Routière) (a 15-min walk from the medina, along Av. Mohamed V). 06:00-22:00. There are two main bus companies serving Chefchaouen: CTM and Nejme Chamal, plus a few smaller ones. All of them terminate/start from this station. Supratours coaches don't serve Chefchaouen, reaching only as far as Tetouan and Fes. Storing piece of luggage in a bus trunk cost 5 dirham, don't pay more. Bus station hosts ticket offices, basic shop, toilet and a cafe serving simple snacks.    (updated Jan 2023)\nGetting there/away: there are usually a couple of petit taxis waiting for a customer at the entry, 10 dirham to get to the medina (as of Jan 2023). Otherwise it's 15 minutes walk uphill.\n\n## By taxi\n35.16767-5.275592 Grand taxi stand to Tetouan and Tangier (right next to the main bus station). The journey from Tangier to Chefchaouen takes about 2½ hr and takes you down some interesting mountain roads with lots of photo opportunities. About 70 dirham per person. At the same time private day trip from Tangier to Chefchaouen will cost about €100. Taxi to Oued Laou costs 30 dirham per passenger/200 dirham pr car, 1 hr, alternatively get a bus to Tetouan and hire a taxi/get on a bus from there. Taxi to Akchour waterfalls costs 30 dirham per passenger/150 dirham per car, 30 min.    (updated Jun 2023)\n35.165323-5.2627993 Grand taxi stand to Bab Taza, Ouezzane. There are grand taxis outside of the Meknes Gare Routière (bus station) that will get you to Chefchaouen by way of Ouezzane. The taxi from Meknes to Ouezzane takes about 2 hr and costs 50 dirham per person in a full taxi (6 passengers). It takes about 2 hr from Ouezzane to Chefchaouen and costs 35 dirham per person. It's possible to travel with fewer than 6 people, though you'll have to pay the full fare for 6 people. These taxi drivers do not seem interested in overcharging tourists, and without negotiation you should be able to pay the standard fare that Moroccan passengers pay.    (updated Jan 2018)\n\n## On foot\nChefchaouen is compact and easily walkable. This is what many people come here for.\n\n## By guide/tout\nIf you are looking for sports or peaceful hiking tours, Chefchaouen is the ideal starting point to branch out in the villages and the surrounding mountains of the Rif with a local guide who knows well the region or just by yourself.\n\n## By car\nIf you go to Chefchaouen by car, there are several small car parks on the perimeter of the ancient medina. Car parks are not signposted nor do they have meters, but are tended by people who would claim to be 'guardians'. The going rate seems to be 10 dirham per day—pay when you leave to avoid paying twice.\nAlso, parking is possible at these specific places:\n35.168889-5.2608891 Plaza el-Majzen (Ave Hassan II), next to Hotel Parador\n35.168889-5.2583062 Corner of Rue Jamaa Sebanin and Rue Sidi Ahmed El Ouafi (6 spaces), near the less touristy Bab El Ounsar gate\n35.171667-5.2611393 Bab El Mahrouk gate (30 spaces), just outside, possibly more further away from the gate\n\n## Medina\nThe medina is the focal point of interest for most visitors to Chefchaouen. Walking around the town with its whitewashed walls, decorated in this style by Jewish immigrants, can be a nice change to the hustle and bustle of the cities of Marrakech, Rabat, and Fez.\n35.16854-5.261661 Kasbah, Outae Hammam square. 09:00–18:00. One of the first buildings constructed in the city in the Andalusian style. It includes emir's residence, a small mosque for the emir, a prison, a garden, a horse stable, dozens of towers and courtyard, which is green and almost alien amidst the mountain setting. 80 dirham for foreigners, 10 dirham for locals.    (updated Jun 2024)\n35.1688-5.262412 Outae Hammam square. The biggest and the main square of the old Medina. Its name originates from 'outae' meaning \"low ground or yard\" and 'hammam' - traditional public bath or dove (hamama in Arabic). Its design is similar to the Andalusian public yards of Granada or Cordoba. It was a market before it became a tourist center surrounded by cafes and restaurants.    (updated Jan 2023)\n35.1684-5.262363 Grand Mosque of Chefchaouen, Outae Hammam square. The oldest mosque (built in 1475-76) and the main historic Friday mosque of Chefchaouen. Off limits to non-Muslims.      (updated Jan 2023)\n35.16806-5.263384 Souiqah quarter (Souq quarter). It's the second-oldest residential agglomeration of the houses of old Andalusian families. There are a large number of shops and stalls that sell local products.    (updated Jan 2023)\n35.17173-5.256275 Ras El Ma (east of the medina). A water spring and a meeting point for local residents who come to cool off, chat and do their laundry (including carpets on sunny Sundays). There is a café above the spring with plastic chairs offering a nice change from the main square.    (updated Jan 2023)\n35.168982-5.2636426 El Haouta square (Al-Hawta square). Small square with a traditional fountain in the middle.    (updated Jan 2023)\n\n## Nearby\n35.16554-5.255637 Jemaa Bouzafar Mosque (Spanish Mosque). A rarely used mosque overlooking the town from a hill behind Ras El Ma. It was built by the Spanish in the 1920s and is now a popular sunset view point. There is a trail leading to another mosque — 35.15706-5.250758 Lubar Al-Fawqi Mosque  further uphill.    (updated Jan 2023)\n35.175011-5.2644969 Ecomuseum of Talassemtane National Park. Smallish museum showcasing fauna and flora of Talassemtane National Park. Introduces the park itself as well as provides with hiking maps. Free admission.    (updated Jan 2023)\n35.172469-5.26704510 Hill of the Hotel Atlas. A good viewpoint on the town and the valley, especially on sunsets. It can be reached from the south gate of the medina (Bab el-Ain) by climbing the road coasting the medina on the west side until the east gate (Bab Souk), and then uphill, crossing the old cemetery on a rocky path.    (updated Jan 2023)\n\n## Hikes\nTake a hike through the scenic Rif Mountains. There is 35.17366-5.256661 a pathway leading up into the mountains just behind the Ras El Ma frequented by backpackers. Don't mind the vast marijuana plantations; the farmers and goat herders that work them are used to tourists and will either ignore you or try to sell you hash.\nA strenuous hike up 35.1882-5.24972 Jebel al-Kalaa (the peak immediately overlooking the town) is fun, but can take up to 9 hours round trip and goes by (and if you're lucky/unlucky, through) big marijuana plantations. The route is not well marked (with white and yellow), and you might have to trail blaze for parts of it if you lose the trail. Start by following the road up the southeastern valley, from where you'll get a good view of town, and look for the markings up the mountain. Bring plenty of water, and some snacks. There a 35.1747-5.25883 viewpoint on the way to Jebel al-Kalaa which can be reached in 30 min counting from the city walls.\nA two-day hike in the 35.130601-5.0828814 Talasemtane national park  via 35.1757-5.20031 Asilane to Akchour also starts up the big mountain on a 4WD track which goes of in the north of Chefchaouen just after the camping site. At the peak at about 1,800 m is a camping site. There may be snow even until April, so be prepared for cold temperatures. There are at least two water sources on the way up, so you'll not need to carry too much water. It's about 14 km until the gite in Asilane. The 4WD track continues until the next village from where one has to cross over a small valley, continue straight after passing a tomb-house and climb down the small path to the village of Inezgane. From there, a mule treck follows the river more or less closely and the gorgeous mountains, cliffs and breathtaking views. After a while the path goes down to the river over an ancient bridge and continues north, passing a source (although this one might dry up in summer) and eventually leads to the village of Akchour which has another Gite, but also cheaper accommodation. There are more tracks and gites in the area.\nDo a 1½-hr hike in the mountains towards the 35.228359-5.1776815 The God's bridge (Pond de Dieu). After the dam, the path lies on the right side of the river and goes up the hill quite steep. The bridge was formed by the river floating underground and carving its way over millennia. There seems also be a way down at the river, so one can see the bridge from below. Don't try this in spring though, as after snow-melt or rain the river may be unpassable. To left over the river starts a path towards the cascades.\n35.2389-5.16096 Petit cascades. Easy 40 min, 2 km (one way) hike.    (updated Jan 2023)\n35.21832-5.138427 Grand Cascade D'Akchour. Moderate 6 km (one way) hike.    (updated Jan 2023)\n\n## Hammams\nHave a bath in hammam together with locals for 15 dirham (separate hours for men and women) or rent a private room just for yourself for 100 dirham per hour (as of Jan 2023). There are several hammams scattered around medina, one of them - 35.16954-5.265478 hammam.\n\n## Workshops\nHassan's Workshop (In the eastern medina, between the old olive tree and Ras El Ma), ☏ +212 065 00717. 09:00-18:00-ish. Run by a tremendously approachable man called Hassan, it can be found towards the eastern end of the medina, between the old olive tree and the waterfall. Once you're in the vicinity, just ask for \"El Taller de Hassan\" and you'll be pointed in the right direction (or call ahead). He speaks fluent Spanish and good English & French, and is amenable to any peculiarities or requests you might have. He doesn't look for sales out of his workshop, as he makes good trade through the various local stores and a few overseas bulk buyers, but he enjoys making one-offs, which makes for wonderful craftsmanship, great prices and no hassle. Word of caution do not make him ship goods to you, they often \"forget\" it. (updated Mar 2015)\nGite Talassemtane Tours. Can organise pottery and gastronomy workshops. (updated Mar 2018)\n\n## Buy\nAll the usuals are on offer in the medina — carpets, leatherwares, spices, metal wares, etc. If you're a seasoned bargainer you can probably get better prices in Fes or Marrakech, but Chefchaouen is undoubtedly a more pleasant place to shop. You'll also find plenty of hippie-wear aimed at budget travelers and marijuana tourists.\nChaouen is particularly renowned for leather artisans, and there are 4 or 5 workshops dotted through the town, whose goods you can find at many of the local stores and in the larger northern cities. Many of the craftsmen in Fes and Tetouan served their apprenticeships here. The choice in local stores is often limited to bags and purses, so if you're up for it take advantage of the workshops where you can tweak a standard design or come up with something entirely your own, even moving beyond traditional leather into snake, crocodile, lizard and more. They can make pretty much anything, from guitar straps and tobacco pouches, to handbags and jackets. It can take a couple of days to make the more complex designs, so head there on your first day.\n\n## Eat\nThe local speciality is baissara, but you'll also find the usual staples such as tajine (vegetable stew with goat or sheep), harira (tomato soup), kofte (meatballs) and tagras (fish). The Moroccan salad is a salad of cucumber and tomatoes, while salada variada includes eggs. The region is also well known for olives and olive oil, and for goat cheese, which is sold on display in various shops.\nAlways busy restaurants near the Kasbah (Outa Hamman square) offer tajines starting from 40 dirham of somewhat subpar quality.\nLocal breakfast includes fried eggs, cheese, olives, Moroccan mortadella, bread and tea/coffee, all for 20-25 dirham. Pretty much any cafe will be happy to serve it.\nSome stalls cook pancakes (baghrir) with honey and olive oil or butter, for 10-15 dirham.\n\n## Budget\n35.1695-5.261691 Dar Antonio, 36 calle Garmata, ☏ +212 539 989 997, +212 661 895 010.

(updated Aug 2023)\n\n## Stay safe\nAs Chefchaouen is on the edge of Morocco's marijuana growing region, touts desperate to extract money from travelers can be a serious problem. They can often be quite persistent, however, smiling, remaining calm, and politely refusing (repeatedly) will usually work.\nTravelers hiking in the Rif Mountain area close to the town can run into the areas of marijuana production. While most of the growers may ignore you, some may offer to sell to you as well. While many travelers partake in or even come here specifically for the abundance of marijuana (hashish), understand that it is definitely illegal and there is nothing stopping you being proscecuted for buying, transporting, or smoking it.\nOn arriving in Chefchaouen, you may be met by touts at the bus station. They will claim the hotel you're looking for is closed or under restoration. Don't trust these at all and insist on going to your planned destination. They will probably try to take you to some cheap and low-quality hostel in the medina - but it is better to find the place by yourself, because if you arrive with touts, you'll be charged extra so they can get their commission. Touts will then insist that you follow them to their house in the medina, and there try to sell you a stash of dope for 300-500 dirham. Refusing to buy is not contemplated, nor safe, if you end up in such a situation, so just say no from the beginning and don't accept their \"help\".\nThe tap water in Chefchaouen is fed from local springs, so it's way cleaner than in other places in Morocco and is safe to drink. However, this does not mean your body will tolerate this water as well as treated tap water. Stick to bottled water if this is a concern.\n\n## Go next\nTetouan\nTangier\nRabat\nCasablanca\nMeknes\nFez\nBerbered and Ketama\nOued Laou\nCeuta",
