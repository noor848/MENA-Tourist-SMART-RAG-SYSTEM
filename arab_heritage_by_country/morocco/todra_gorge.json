Both the Todgha (or Todra) River and the neighbouring Dadès River are responsible for carving out these deep cliff-sided canyons, on their final 40 kilometres (25 mi) through the mountains.

Here the canyon narrows to a flat stony track, in places as little as 10 metres (33 ft) wide, with sheer and smooth rock walls up to 160 metres (525 ft) high on each side.\nDuring the dry season, the canyon floor is mostly dry; at most there will be a small stream of water. During this time, the wadi floor is easily traversed by travelers. During the rainy season, however, the Todra can expand massively, covering the canyon floor in a strong torrent.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "content": "## Overview\nThe High Atlas is a region in Morocco covering the mountain range and surrounding destinations such as Marrakech. It's a regular destination for mountain hikers, ski enthusiasts, or travellers interested in the indigenous Berber culture found throughout its many peaks and valleys.\n\n## Understand\nBerbers are the indigenous North Africans, having inhabited the north coast of Africa ranging from present day Morocco to Egypt, for at least 5,000 years.\nThe Arab invasion of North Africa in the 7th century forced Berbers to assimilate, or take refuge in the Atlas mountains.\nIt is said that as much as 80% of the Moroccan population is racially Berber, however only half of those people live culturally Berber lifestyles.\nBerbers have adopted Islam as their primary religion, but continue to speak Berber languages in their villages, and practice Berber music, spirituality, and art.\nThe Atlas mountains are home to relatively pure Berber populations, who live in earthen adobe houses. Marrakech is the only Moroccan city with a recognizable Berber ambiance, being situated at the base of the southern Atlas mountains.
