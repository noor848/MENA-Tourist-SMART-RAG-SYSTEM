      "content": "Rabat (, also UK: , US: ; Arabic: الرباط, romanized: ar-Ribāṭ) is the capital city of Morocco and the country's seventh-largest city with an urban population of approximately 580,000 (2014) and a metropolitan population of over 1.2 million. It is also the capital city of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region. Rabat is located on the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the river Bou Regreg, opposite Salé, the city's main commuter town.\nRabat was founded in the 12th century by the Almohads. After a period of growth, the city fell  into a long period of decline. In the 17th century, Rabat became a haven for Barbary pirates. When the French established a protectorate over Morocco in 1912,  Rabat became its administrative center. When Morocco achieved independence in 1955, Rabat became its capital.\nRabat, Temara, and Salé form a conurbation of over 1.8 million people. Rabat is one of four Imperial cities of Morocco, and its medina is listed as a World Heritage Site. It is accessible by train through the ONCF system and by plane through the nearby Rabat–Salé Airport.\n\nEtymology\nThe name Rabat comes from the Arabic word الرباط (a-Ribāṭ) meaning the ribat, an Islamic base or fortification. This name is short for رباط الفتح (Ribāṭu al-Fatḥ) meaning the ribat of conquest or stronghold of victory—a title given by the Almohads when they established the city as a naval base in 1170.\n\nHistory\nAncient Sala\nIn the first millennium BC the Phoenicians founded several trading colonies along the Atlantic coast of what is now Morocco, but the existence of a Phoenician settlement in the area, called Sala or Shallat, has been debated by archeologists. By the first century BC the local inhabitants were still writing in the neo-Punic language, but the region came under the influence of Rome. It was controlled by the ancient Berber Mauretanian Kingdom until it was formally annexed by Rome in the first century BC. On the site now known as Chellah, just south of the walled city today, the Romans built a city named Sala Colonia. Excavations have revealed that older Mauretanian structures existed on the site before Roman structures were built over them. Along with Lixus, Sala Colonia was one of the two main naval outposts held by the Romans on the Atlantic coast of the Mauretania Tingitana province. The port of Sala (now disappeared) was used by commercial Roman ships as a way station on their southwestward passages to Anfa and the Insula Purpuraria (Mogador island).\nArchaeological objects of Visigothic and Byzantine origin found in the area attest to the persistence of commercial or political contacts between Sala and Roman Europe, up to the establishment of a Byzantine presence in North Africa during the 7th century. However, Sala began to be abandoned in the 5th century and was mostly in ruins when the Muslim Arabs arrived in the 7th century and established Islamic influence in the region.\n\nMedieval Islamic period\nIn the 10th century the Umayyads of Cordoba, or their Zenata Berber allies in the region, founded a ribat or fortified monastery/outpost in this area, to defend against the Barghawata Berbers who had established a Kharijite state to the south. This ribat was most likely on the same site as the current Kasbah of the Udayas, but its location has not been confirmed by historians. Around 1030, a new town called Salā (the present Salé) was founded on the opposite side of the river (the north side) by the Banu 'Ashara family.\nOne of the last Almoravid emirs, Tashfin ibn Ali (r. 1143–1145) built a new ribat on the site of the current kasbah as part of his efforts to hold back the Almohads. Almohads nonetheless defeated the Almoravids and destroyed the ribat shortly after. In 1150 or 1151 the Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu'min built a new kasbah (citadel) to replace the former ribat, within which he included a palace and a mosque. This Almohad kasbah corresponds to the current Kasbah of the Udayas (which was expanded in later periods). Abd al-Mu'min also had an underground canal dug to divert a water source to this location, allowing for future settlement and urbanization in the area. The site became a military staging ground for Almohad armies setting out on campaigns to Al-Andalus.\nThe Almohad caliph Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur (r. 1184–1199) embarked on an ambitious project to construct a new fortified imperial capital, called al-Mahdiyya or Ribat al-Fath, on the site of what is now the medina (old city) of Rabat, with new walls extending over a vast area beyond the kasbah. This project also included the construction of an enormous mosque (the remains of which include the Hassan Tower) and of new grand gateways such as Bab er-Rouah and the main gate of the kasbah, now known as Bab Udaya or Bab al-Kbir. After al-Mansur's death in 1199 the mosque and the capital remained unfinished and his successors lacked the resources or the will to finish it. The new city was never fully inhabited and the site was practically abandoned.\nDuring the Marinid dynasty period (13th to 15th centuries), the town of Salé across the river grew more important than the settlements of the south bank. In 1515 Leo Africanus reported that Rabat had declined so much that only 100 inhabited houses remained. The Marinids did build a Great Mosque in what is now the medina of Rabat and on the nearby site of Chellah (ancient Sala) they built a royal necropolis for their dynasty.\n\nCorsair republic\nIn 1609, Philip III decreed the expulsion of all Moriscos (people of Muslim or Moorish descent) from Spain. About 2000 of these refugees, originally from the town of Hornachos near Badajoz, Spain, settled around Salé and occupied the kasbah, attracting between 5000 and 14,000 other Moriscos to join them. Rabat and neighboring Salé united to form the Republic of Bou Regreg in 1627. This autonomous republic became a base for corsairs: pirates, also known as the \"Salé Rovers\", who preyed on merchant ships around the shores of Western Europe. \nDuring this time, the area below the kasbah on the south bank became more heavily populated, thanks to the Morisco and Andalusi refugees. A new \"Andalusian Wall\" was built to delimit this area in the northern part of the former Almohad walled city. What is now known as the Street of the Consuls became an important road artery even at this time. The name \"Rabat\" was not yet in use; the city of the south bank was known as \"New Salé\" while the city of the north bank was known as \"Old Salé\". Corsair activities were based in New Salé, whereas the inhabitants of Old Salé generally did not participate in piracy.\n\n'Alawi rule\nThe pirates did not have to contend with any central authority until al-Rashid, the founder of the 'Alawi dynasty, conquered the area in 1666 and united most of Morocco under his rule. Nonetheless, the 'Alawi sultans allowed the piracy to continue up until the reign of Moulay Slimane in the early 19th century. This led to the shelling of the city by Austria in 1829 after an Austrian ship had been lost to a pirate attack.\n\nDuring the early part of the 'Alawi period (17th–18th centuries), the sultans took some interest in the city of the south bank and carried out constructions and repairs to the kasbah. Moulay Isma'il (r. 1672–1727) expanded the kasbah southward and built a royal residence within it towards the end of the 17th century (it serves as a museum today). Moulay Isma'il was also responsible for settling a part of the Udayas (or Oudayas), a guich tribe (military tribe serving the sultan's army), in the kasbah to serve as a counterbalancing force against other unruly tribes in the region. Under Sidi Muhammad ibn 'Abdallah (r. 1757–1790), a new royal palace, the Dar al-Makhzen, was established in the southwest part of the Almohad walled area towards the end of the 18th century. These additions began to give the city the character and function of a royal residence used by the ruling dynasty outside their main capitals.\nMoulay Slimane (r. 1792–1822) built another palace along the seaside called Dar al-Bahr and built new mosques such as the Moulay Slimane Mosque. He also ordered the creation of a Jewish quarter, the Mellah, in the eastern part of the Andalusian medina, in a formerly occupied by orchards. It was also towards the beginning of the 19th century that the city walls, formerly limited to the Almohad-era perimeter, were extended significantly to the southwest, thus expanding the city to cover around 840 hectares. The old Almohad walls and gates were still retained and the Almohad-era enclosure remained a more privileged district containing the city's major monuments and its imperial residence. Most of the population remained concentrated in the medina behind the Andalusian Wall in the northern section. In the 1850s, Moulay Abd ar-Rahman (r. 1822–1859) further developed and completed the Dar al-Makhzen palace in the southwest corner of this enclosure. At the end of the 19th century or beginning of the 20th century, the city had some 20,000 to 25,000 inhabitants.\n\n20th century\nFrench colonial rule\nThe French invasion of Morocco began in the east with General Hubert Lyautey's occupation of Oujda in March 1907 and in the west with the Bombardment of Casablanca in August 1907. The Treaty of Fes established the protectorate in March 1912. Acting as French administrator of Morocco, Lyautey decided to relocate the country's capital from Fes to Rabat after the riots of 1912 following the Treaty of Fes. Lyautey appears to have had a personal affinity for Rabat. He argued that its coastal location was more pleasant and more accessible, and that its proximity to Casablanca, which he estimated would become the major economic center, would be advantageous. In 1913, Lyautey hired Henri Prost to design the Ville Nouvelle (Rabat's modern quarter) as an administrative sector, as he did in other major Moroccan cities.\nThe colonial period resulted in major economic changes as well as accelerated urbanization. Prior to this period, the major cities of Morocco had always been Fez and Marrakesh, while the coastal cities were relatively small. Census figures are not available for the early years of the Protectorate, but in 1912 Rabat and nearby Salé can be estimated to have had about 35,000 to 40,000 inhabitants at most, according to Janet Abu-Lughod. One early French survey, based on the number of houses rather than a formal census, estimated the population of Rabat to be 25,642. A formal census in 1921 counted the population as 33,714. Some of this growth was due to the immigration of foreigners. In 1921, 59% of the population were Moroccan Muslims and 10% were Moroccan Jews, while 21.4% were French nationals and another 10% were foreigners of other origin. Nearby Salé, however, remained more homogenously Moroccan. Rabat's population grew to approximately 83,000 in 1936 and to approximately 156,000 in 1952.\n\nPost World War II and independence\nWhen Morocco achieved independence in 1956, Mohammed V, the then King of Morocco, chose to have the capital remain at Rabat. Rabat's growth continued unabated. The most important demographic shift after independence was the exodus of foreign nationals and their replacement by Moroccans, who gradually took over the jobs and functions that the foreigners had occupied. In the census of 1971, the population of Rabat had grown to around 368,000, of which only 3.5% were foreigners.\nFollowing World War II, the United States had established a military presence in Rabat at the former French air base. By the early 1950s, Rabat Salé Air Base was a U.S. Air Force installation hosting the 17th Air Force and the 5th Air Division, which oversaw forward basing for Strategic Air Command (SAC) B-47 Stratojet aircraft in the country. With the destabilization of French government in Morocco, and Moroccan independence in 1956, the government of Mohammed V wanted the U.S. Air Force to pull out of the SAC bases in Morocco, insisting on such action after American intervention in Lebanon in 1958. The United States agreed to leave as of December 1959, and was fully out of Morocco by 1963. SAC felt the Moroccan bases were much less critical with the long range capability of the B-52 Stratofortresses that were replacing the B-47s and with the completion of the USAF installations in Spain in 1959. With the USAF withdrawal from Rabat-Salé in the 1960s, the facility became a primary facility for the Royal Moroccan Air Force known as Air Base Nº 1, a status it continues to hold.\nThe fifth Arab League summit took place in Rabat in 1969 to discuss the arson of Al-Aqsa Mosque by Australian citizen Denis Michael Rohan. In the same year, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, an organization that aims to protect the interests of the Muslim world, was founded at a summit in Rabat. The 1974 Arab League summit was also held in Rabat. The summit recognized the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. In 1985, the sixth edition of the Pan Arab Games was held in Rabat.\nIn 2015, the city became part of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region. On 28 February 2024, Asmaa Rhlalou declared her resignation, months after she sparked a controversy that called into doubt her authority and validity within the City Council.\n\nGeography\nNeighbourhoods of Rabat\nRabat is an administrative city. It has many shopping districts and residential neighbourhoods. The geographically spread out neighbourhoods are as follows:\nThe heart of the city consists of three parts: the Medina (old town); the Oudayas and Hassan both located to meet the Bou Regreg; and the Atlantic Ocean.\nTo the west, and along the waterfront, there is a succession of neighbourhoods.\nFirst, around the ramparts, there is the old neighbourhoods, Quartier l'Océan and Quartier les Orangers. Beyond that, a succession of mostly working-class districts: Diour Jamaa, Akkari, Yacoub El Mansour, Massira and Hay el Fath are the main parts of this axis. Hay el Fath, which ends this sequence, evolves into a middle-class neighbourhood.\nTo the east, along the Bouregreg, the Youssoufia region (working and middle class) : Mabella; Taqaddoum; Hay Nahda (mostly middle class); Aviation (middle and upper middle class); and Rommani.\nBetween the two axes, from north to south, there are three main neighbourhoods (middle class to affluent): Agdal (Ward Building; a lively mix of residential and commercial buildings. The residents are predominantly upper middle class); Hay Riad (affluent villas; this neighbourhood has experienced a surge of momentum since the 2000s); and Souissi (lavish villas, embassies, well-off residential neighborhood).\nOn the outskirts of Souissi, are a number of less-dense regions mainly comprising large private houses to areas that seem out of the city.\n\nSubdivisions\nThe prefecture is divided administratively into the following:\n\nClimate\nRabat features a Mediterranean climate (Csa) with warm to hot, dry summers and mild, damp winters. Located along the Atlantic Ocean, Rabat has a mild, temperate climate, shifting from cool in winter to warm days in the summer months. The nights are always cool (or cold in winter, it can reach sub 0 °C (32 °F) sometimes), with daytime temperatures generally rising about 7–8 °C (13–14 °F). The winter highs typically reach only 17.2 °C (63.0 °F) in December–February. Summer daytime highs usually hover around 27 °C (80.6 °F), but may occasionally exceed 40 °C (104.0 °F) during heat waves. Summer nights are usually pleasant and cool, ranging between 11 and 19 °C (51.8 and 66.2 °F) and rarely exceeding 20 °C (68.0 °F). Rabat belongs to the sub-humid bioclimatic zone with an average annual precipitation of 560 mm (22 in). The airport station is located about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from the coastline, which will somewhat warm afternoons and cool nights down compared to a seaside location.\n\nCulture\nThe biggest place for theatre is the Mohammed V Theatre in the centre of the town, which was opened in 1962. Construction on a new performing arts center, the Grand Theatre of Rabat, began in 2014. Designed by Zaha Hadid, it will reportedly be the largest theater in the Arab world and in Africa. It was scheduled to open in 2021.\nMany organizations are active in cultural and social issues. Orient-Occident Foundation and ONA Foundation are the biggest of these. An independent art scene is active in the city. L'appartement 22, which is the first independent space for visual arts created by Abdellah Karroum, opened in 2002 and introduced international and local artists. Other independent spaces opened few years after, such as Le Cube, also set up in a private space.\n\nMawazine\nMawazine is a music festival in Rabat organized under the auspices of King Mohammed VI of Morocco, that started in 2001 where music groups, fans and spectators come together in a week-long celebration of culture and music both locally and internationally. Musicians such as Scorpions, The Weeknd, Jennifer Lopez, Kanye West, Pitbull, Rihanna, Elton John, Stromae and many others have performed at the festival.\nMawazine was host to more than 2,500,000 in 2013. Workshops are available for teaching dances and other arts. The festival is free. However, while most areas are free, there are those that require payment, specifically the smaller stages being the historical site of Chellah, the Mohammed V National Theater, and the Renaissance Cultural Center.\n\nPlaces of worship\nThe places of worship are predominantly Muslim mosques. The oldest mosque in the city is the \"Old Mosque\" (Jama' al-'Atiqa) in the Kasbah of the Udayas. It was originally founded during Abd al-Mu'min's construction of the kasbah in 1150, though its current form mostly dates from an 18th-century restoration. Other important mosques include the Great Mosque in the old medina, also known as the el-Kharrazin Mosque, and the As-Sunna Mosque in central Rabat, originally completed in 1785 by Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah.\n\nThe last remaining synagogues in Rabat are the Rabbi Shalom Zaoui synagogue and the Talmud Torah Synagogue. There are also Christian churches and temples, including an Evangelical church and St. Peter's Cathedral (Cathédrale de Saint-Pierre), which hosts the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rabat.\n\nMuseums and parks\nThe Oudayas Museum (also formerly known as the National Museum of Jewellery) is housed in a pavilion residence built by Sultan Moulay Isma'il (r. 1672–1727) inside the Kasbah of the Udayas. It was first opened in 1915, making it one of the oldest public museums in Morocco. Its collections, augmented by private donations, feature diverse objects from throughout Morocco, mostly from the 18th to 20th centuries. In 2006 it became the National Museum of Jewellery, with exhibits focusing on the history of Moroccan jewellery. As of 2019 it was under renovations to be transformed into a new museum to be called Musée du caftan et de la parure ('Museum of the caftan and adornment').\nThe Museum of History and Civilizations (formerly the National Archeological Museum) showcases the history of Morocco through a collection of archeological artifacts from the Punic, Mauretanian, Roman, and Islamic periods. This includes a collection of ancient Roman bronze and marble statuary from sites such as Lixus, Volubilis, and Chellah, as well as coins, ceramics, and architectural fragments from the Islamic period.\nThe Rabat Zoo (officially called the Zoological Garden of Rabat) was opened in 1973, in part to house the lions that were previously kept at the Royal Palace. The lions are descended from the now-extinct Barbary lions. Since then the zoo has expanded to house some 1800 animals and has engaged in conservation efforts.\nThe Bank al-Maghrib Museum was inaugurated in 2002 and is housed at the Bank al-Maghrib building downtown. Its main exhibits include a collection of coins and currency from ancient times to the modern era, as well as a gallery of Orientialist art. The Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art was inaugurated in 2014.\n\nHistoric monuments\nThe Kasbah of the Udayas (also spelled \"Kasbah of the Oudaias\") is the oldest part of the present-day city, built by the Almohads in the 12th century. It was later refortified and expanded by the corsairs and the 'Alawi dynasty in the 17th and 18th centuries. The kasbah is now a residential district with traditional houses painted white and blue on the outside. Its southern section includes the \"Andalusian Garden\", landscaped in the 20th century.\nThe city's historic walls were first built by the Almohad caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur and completed in 1197, with later additions in the 17th and 19th centuries. A number of monumental gates are found along the walls, the most notable being Bab er-Rouah. The other Almohad-era gates are Bab el-Had, Bab al-Alou, Bab Zaers, and Bab al-Hadid, though many of them were modified in more recent periods. The 17th-century Andalusian Wall, which divides the zone inside the Almohad walls, has five more gates: Bab Jdid (formerly Bab Teben, mostly demolished), Bab al-Bouiba, Bab Chellah, Bab Mellah, and Bab Diouana.\nThe old medina, located below the kasbah and above the line of the Andalusian Wall, contains many historic mosques and traditional houses. The rest of the area within the Almohad walls but south of the Andalusian Wall was largely built up in the 20th century when Rabat became the capital during the French Protectorate. These districts contain numerous public buildings and apartment blocs built in contemporary styles of that period, such as neo-Moorish (known as néo-Mauresque or arabisant in French), Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and modern architecture. Examples of these include the Bank al-Maghrib building (built in the 1920s), the Central Post Office building (circa 1921, expanded in 1930s), the Parliament building (built in the 1920s), St.-Peter's Cathedral (inaugurated in 1921, with later additions), the Rabat-Ville train station (early 1920s), and some of the apartment blocs on Rue Gaza (built or begun in the 1930s), among others.\nOverlooking the shores of the river is the Hassan Tower, a monumental unfinished minaret constructed by Ya'qub al-Mansur in the late 12th century. It was built for an enormous mosque planned as part of the larger city al-Mansur was constructing. Across from the tower today, at the southern end of the mosque's remains, is the Mausoleum of Mohammed V (d. 1961), which houses the remains of King Mohammed V and King Hassan II. The mausoleum, completed in 1971, was designed in a neo-Moorish or Moroccan revivalist style by Vietnamese architect Cong Vo Toan.\n\nA short distance south of the historic city walls is the archeological site of Chellah, a walled enclosure containing a 13th to 14th-century Marinid funerary and religious complex as well as the ruins of the Roman city of Sala Colonia. Across the river is the city of Salé, which also preserves a historic medina. The medina of Salé includes monuments from the Marinid period such as Bab Mrissa and the Madrasa of Abu al-Hasan as well as landmarks from later periods.\n\nEducation\nColleges and universities\nPublic:\n\nMohammed V University was founded in 1957\nNational Institute of Statistics and Applied Economics was founded 1961\nNational School of Architecture (1980)\nPrivate: \n\nHEM Business School, founded 1993\n\nTransport\nAir\nRabat's main airport is Rabat–Salé Airport.\n\nTrains\nRabat is served by two principal railway stations run by the national rail service ONCF.\nRabat-Ville and Rabat Agdal are the two main inter-city stations, from which trains run south to Casablanca, Marrakech and El Jadida, north to Tangier, or east to Meknes, Fez, Taza and Oujda.\nONCF operates the Le Bouregreg urban rail for Rabat-Salé agglomeration. Marrakesh is a 4 hr journey, Fez 21⁄2 hr on an express train and 31⁄2 hr on other trains and Casablanca 1 hr.\n\nTram\nThe Rabat–Salé tramway was the first tramway network in Morocco and connects Rabat with Salé across the river. It was opened on 11 May 2011 after a construction cost of 3.6 billion MAD. The network was constructed by Alstom Citadis and is operated by Transdev. As of February 2022, the network had two lines with a total length of 26.9 km (17 miles) and 43 stations.  In 2023, an extension of the network was being planned and is due to be completed by 2028.\n\nCity buses\nAfter some years of neglect as investment was directed at the tramway, the existing operator, STAREO, was displaced in 2019. A contract was awarded to Alsa-City Bus, a joint venture between Moroccan company City Bus and Spanish company Alsa, a subsidiary of the Mobico Group. The new operator took over in July 2019 with a commitment to three hundred and fifty new buses. These will comprise 102 Mercedes-Benz and 248 Scania vehicles. The contract covers a 15-year period, renewable for seven years, and promises approximately 10 billion MAD investment into the bus transport system in the region.\n\nSport\nIn Rabat is the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium (Arabic: ملعب الأمير مولاي عبد لله) is a multi-purpose stadium. The new venue as of 2025 replaced the original Prince Moulay Abdellah stadium on the same site. The first stadium was built in 1983 and was the home ground of ASFAR (football club) and was mostly used for football matches, and it can also stage athletics competitions. The 1983 stadium held 52,000 spectators, whilst the new stadium has a seating capacity of 67,800 and will be used as a multi-purpose venue to host cultural events as well as sports. Since 2008, the 1983 stadium hosted the Meeting International Mohammed VI d'Athlétisme de Rabat. It is named after Prince Moulay Abdellah of Morocco.\nRabat hosted the 2019 African Games after Malabo, Equatorial Guinea was stripped of hosting due to economic matters. It was the first time the African Games were hosted by Morocco. It is one of the host cities for the 2030 FIFA World Cup.\n\nFootball\nRabat's most popular sport club is the association football clubs ASFAR and FUS de Rabat. Well known in the continental competitions. AS FAR have won 2 major African titles, including 1 CAF Champions League and 1 CAF Confederation Cup. While Fus de Rabat has only managed to win one major African title, 1 CAF Confederation Cup.\nThe local football teams are:\n\nASFAR (football club)\nASFAR (women)\nFUS de Rabat\nStade Marocain\nHilal de Rabat\nUnion de Touarga\nYoussoufia Club de Rabat\n\nHandball\nASFAR\nFUS de Rabat\nLe Stade Marocain\n\nBasketball\nThe local basketball teams are:\n\nASFAR\nFUS de Rabat\nMoghreb de Rabat\nFAR\n\nVolleyball\nASFAR\nFUS de Rabat\nCrédit agricole Rabat\n\nNotable people\nTwin towns – sister cities\nRabat is twinned with:\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nRabat Tourist Portal\nEntry in Lexicorient.

2024. تقع على ساحل المحيط الأطلسي، وعلى الضفة اليسرى لمصب نهر أبي رقراق الذي يفصلها عن مدينة سلا. تشتهر المدينة بصناعة النسيج كما توجد بها جامعة محمد الخامس أول جامعة حديثة أُسِّسَتْ في المغرب بعد الاستقلال.\nأُسست العاصمة الحالية للمغرب خلال أزمنة تاريخية مختلفة، فكانت بداية معالمها التأسيسية خلال حقبة المرابطين الذي جعلوا منها رباطًا منيعًا ونقطة لصد وردع هجمات البورغواطيين، وبعد سقوطهم تسلَّم مشعلها الموحدون في القرن الثاني عشر فجعلوا منها مدينة محصنة تنطلق منها الجيوش إلى الأندلس، شملت بالإضافة إلى القلعة، مسجدًا ودارًا للخلافة، ويعتبر يعقوب المنصور، المؤسس الحقيقي لمدينة «رِباط الفتح» التي جعل منها عاصمة لدولته وأمر بتحصين كافة أسوارها، فيما ذكر عدة مؤرخين أن اكتمال بناء المدينة كان في عهد أبي يوسف المنصور، بما في ذلك السور والبوابات، فنمت المدينة في البداية إلا أنها ما لبثت أن دخلت في فترة طويلة من الانحدار بعد انهيار الموحدين. وخلال القرن السابع عشر، أصبحت الرباط ملاذًا لقراصنة البربر. عندما فرض الفرنسيون حماية على المغرب في عام 1912، جعلوا الرباط مركزها الإداري. وعندما حصل المغرب على استقلاله في عام 1956، أصبحت الرباط عاصمته.\nتضم المدينة بالإضافة لكل من تمارة وسلا المجاورتين أكثر من 1.8 مليون نسمة. قللت مشكلات الطمي المرتبطة بالميناء من دور الرباط كميناء؛ ومع ذلك، تحتفظ الرباط وسلا بصناعات مهمة كالنسيج ومعالجة الأغذية والبناء. بالإضافة إلى ذلك، تجعل السياحة ووجود جميع السفارات الأجنبية في المغرب الرباط واحدة من أهم المدن في البلاد. تم تصنيف الرباط عاصمة المغرب في المركز الثاني من قبل شبكة سي إن إن في قائمتها لأفضل وجهات السفر لعام 2013. إنها واحدة من عواصم المغرب التاريخية الأربع، والمدينة القديمة في الرباط مدرجة كموقع تراث عالمي. يمكن الوصول إلى الرباط عن طريق القطار من خلال شبكة قطارات المكتب الوطني للسكك الحديدية وعن طريق الطائرة من خلال مطار الرباط سلا الدولي.\n\nالتسمية\nيأتي اسم الرباط من الكلمة العربية الرباط التي تعني الرباط، وهو قاعدة إسلامية أو حصن. هذا الاسم هو اختصار لرباط الفتح بمعنى معقل النصر، وهو لقب أطلقه الموحدون عندما أسسوا المدينة كقاعدة بحرية.\n\nجغرافيا\nتضاريس\nالرباط هي مدينة ساحلية تطل على المحيط الأطلسي، تنتمي لهضبة زعير السفلى، وتعتبر عاصمة منطقة زعير.\n\nمناخ\nمناخ المدينة مناخ متوسطي شبه رطب يخضع للمؤثرات البحرية.\n\nالتقسيم الإداري\nتُصنف مدينة الرباط من حيث التقسيم الإداري للمغرب والذي صدر سنة 2015، كعمالة، تتكون بالأساس من ست مقاطعات هي أكدال-الرياض، والتواركة، والسويسي، واليوسفية، وحسان، ويعقوب المنصور، تتكون بدورها من مجموعة من الأحياء، ولكل من هذه المقاطعات مجلس يدير شؤونها ويسهر على خدمة سكانها.\n\nالتاريخ\nتاريخ قديم\nالحقبة الفينيقية\nفي الألفية الأولى قبل الميلاد، أسس الفينيقيون العديد من المستعمرات التجارية على طول الساحل الأطلسي لما يعرف الآن بالمغرب، ولكن وجود مستوطنة فينيقية في المنطقة، تسمى سلا أو شلات، كان محل نقاش من قبل علماء الآثار. بحلول القرن الأول قبل الميلاد، كان السكان المحليون لا يزالون يكتبون باللغة البونية الجديدة.\n\nالحقبة الرومانية\nالمنطقة أصبحت تحت تأثير روما. كانت تحت سيطرة المملكة الأمازيغية الموريتانية القديمة حتى ضمتها روما رسميًا في القرن الأول قبل الميلاد. في الموقع المعروف الآن باسم شالة ، جنوب المدينة المسورة اليوم ، بنى الرومان مدينة تسمى سالا كولونيا. كشفت الحفريات أن الهياكل الموريتانية القديمة كانت موجودة في الموقع قبل بناء الهياكل الرومانية عليها إلى جانب العرائش ، كانت سالا كولونيا واحدة من أهم نقطتين بحريتين رئيسيتين اللتين يسيطر عليهما الرومان على ساحل المحيط الأطلسي لمقاطعة موريتانيا الطنجية. تم استخدام ميناء سالا الذي اختفى الآن من قبل السفن الرومانية التجارية كمحطة طريق على ممراتهم الجنوبية الغربية المؤدية إلى أنفا وإينسولا بوربوراريا جزيرة موغادور. تشهد القطع الأثرية ذات الأصل القوطي الغربي والبيزنطي والتي تم العثور عليها في المنطقة على استمرار العلاقات التجارية أو السياسية بين سالا وأوروبا الرومانية ، حتى تأسيس الوجود البيزنطي في شمال إفريقيا خلال القرن السابع. ومع ذلك ، بدأ التخلي عن سالا في القرن الخامس وكانت في الغالب في حالة خراب عندما وصل العرب المسلمون في القرن السابع وأقاموا نفوذًا إسلاميًا في المنطقة.\n\nالعصر الوسيط\nالعهد المرابطي\nيرجع تاريخ مدينة الرباط عاصمة المملكة المغربية إلى فترات تاريخية مختلفة. إلا أن التأسيس الأولي للمدينة يعود إلى عهد المرابطين الذين أنشأوا رباطاً محصناً، ذلك أن هاجس الأمن كان أقوى العوامل التي كانت وراء هذا الاختيار ليكون نقطة لتجمع المجاهدين ورد الهجومات البرغواطية.\n\nالعهد الموحدي\nعرفت المدينة خلال العهد الموحدي إشعاعاً تاريخياً وحضارياً، حيث تم تحويل الرباط (الحصن) في عهد عبد المؤمن الموحدي إلى قصبة محّصنة لحماية جيوشه التي كانت تنطلق في حملات جهادية صوب الأندلس. وفي عهد حفيده يعقوب المنصور، أراد أن يجعل من رباط الفتح عاصمة لدولته. فأمر بتحصينها بأسوار متينة، وشيّد بها عدة بنايات، من أشهرها مسجد حسان بصومعته الشامخة. وفي القرن الرابع عشر بدأت الرباط تعرف اضمحلالاً بسبب المحاولات المتتالية للمرينيين للاستيلاء عليها، وأنشؤو مقبرة ملكية بموقع شالة.\nشيد السلطان يعقوب المنصور الموحدي سوراً عُرف بالسور الموحدي، بلغ طوله 2263م. وهو يمتد من الغرب حتى جنوب مدينة الرباط، ويبلغ عرضه 2.5 م وعلوه 10 مترا، هذا السور مدعّم بأربعة وسبعين برجاً، كما تتخلله 5 أبواب (باب العلو، باب الاحد، باب الرواح وباب زعير).\nبقي موقع شالة في الرباط مهجوراً منذ القرن الخامس حتى القرن العاشر الميلادي حيث تحوّل الموقع إلى رباط يتجمع فيه المجاهدون لمواجهة قبيلة برغواطة. لكن هذه المرحلة التاريخية تبقى غامضة إلى أن اتخذ السلطان المريني أبو يوسف يعقوب سنة 1284 م من الموقع مقبرة لدفن ملوك بني مرين وأعيانهم، حيث شيد النواة الأولى لمجمعٍ ضمّ مسجداً وداراً للوضوء وقبة دفنت بها زوجته أم العز.\nحظيت شالة في عهد السلطان أبي الحسن باهتمام بالغ. وبنى ابنه السلطان أبو عنان المدرسة شمال المسجد والحمام والنزالة، وزين أضرحة أجداده بقبب مزخرفة تعتبر نموذجاً حياً للفن المعماري المتميز لدولة بني مرين. تراجعت شالة مباشرة بعد قرار المرينيين بإعادة فتح مقبرة القلة بفاس، فأهملت بناياتها، وتعرضت في بداية القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي للنّهب والتدمير، وأصبحت تدريجياً مقبرة ومحجاً لساكني المنطقة، ومعلمة تاريخية.\n\nيرجع تاريخ شالة القديم إلى عهد البربر الاقدمين سكان هذا القطر الأصلين. حيث تعاقب الملك فيهم أحيانا وأزمانا وأوليتهم في المغرب منذ أحقاب متطاولة لا يعلم مبدأها إلا الله تعالى كما قال ابن خلدون ،فتكون شالة القديمة بناء الملوك البربر. كما صرح الزياني في الترجمانة أنها من بناء الاسكندر ذي القرنين أو إفريقش الحميري الذي دخل المغرب، وأنه أول من أدخل الأمازيغ إليه، وقيل إن تاريخ شالة القديم إنما يرجع لعهد الفنيقيين القرطاجيين حيث أثبت التاريخ أنها كانت من أهم مراكز التاريخ. بل كانت عاصمتهم الإستعمارية كما صرح به جوزيف كانال في قوله على مسافة اثنين كيلومتر من منارة حسان يوجد خراب هضبة شالة التي كانت عاصمة القرطاجيين بعمالة طنجة.وكما كانت عاصمتهم الاستعمارية الإدارية فقد كانت أيضا عاصمتهم التجارية توافيها سفنهم بأنواع المناجر وضروب المتاع وتصدر عنها مواد الجلد والعاج وريش النعام والأصمخ العنبرية وسواها حتى الفيلة التي كان الفنيقيون يستعملوها في حروبهم كما أشار له ابلين تاريخه. ولما دالت الدولة للرومان بالمغرب كانت شالة من أهم مستعمراتهم التي استعمروها مثل وليلي، وطنجةوكانت تنسب إليهم نظرا لما أحدثوه بداخلها من البناءات المتعددة والآثار المتنوعة. واستمرت لمدة خمسمائة عام إلى أن جاء قوم الواندال الكوطيون واستولوا على شطوط إفريقية وخربوا مدن الرومان ومستعمراتهم فكانت شالة جملة ماخربوه . كما صرح به ليون الافريقي. وهذا مما يعود إلى تاريخ شالة القديم.\n\nالعهد المريني\nفي القرن الرابع عشر الميلادي (وتحديدا سنة 1339) أحيط الموقع بسور خماسي الأضلاع مدعم بعشرين برجاً مربعاً وثلاث بوابات، أكبرها وأجملها زخرفة وعمارة الباب الرئيسي للموقع المقابل للسور الموحدي لرباط الفتح. أما داخل الموقع فقد تم تشييد أربع مجموعات معمارية مستقلة ومتكاملة تجسد كلها عظمة مقبرة شالة ومكانتها على العهد المريني. ففي الزاوية الغربية للموقع ترتفع بقايا النزالة التي كانت تأوي الحجاج والزوار. وفي الجزء السفلي تنتصب بقايا المقبرة المرينية المعروفة بالخلوة، والتي تضم مسجداً ومجموعة من القبب، أهمها قبة السلطان أبي الحسن وزوجته شمس الضحى، والمدرسة التي تبقى منارتها المكسوة بزخرفة هندسية متشابكة ومتكاملة وزليجها المتقن الصنع، نموذجاً أصيلاً للعمارة المغربية في القرن الرابع عشر. وفي الجهة الجنوبية الشرقية للموقع يوجد الحمام المتميز بقببه النصف دائرية، التي تحتضن أربع قاعات متوازية: الأولى لخلع الملابس والثانية باردة والثالثة دافئة والرابعة أكثر سخونة. أما حوض النون، فيقع في الجهة الجنوبية الغربية للخلوة، وقد كان في الأصل قاعة للوضوء لمسجد أبي يوسف، وقد نسجت حوله الذاكرة الشعبية خرافات وأساطير جعلت منه مزاراً لفئة عريضة من ساكنة الرباط ونواحيها.العه\n\nجمهورية أبي رقراق\nفي عهد السعديين عام 1609 سمح للأفواج الأخيرة من المسلمين القادمين من الأندلس بالإقامة بالمدينة، وقد شيّد المورسكيون السور الأندلسي وهو يقع على بعد 21 متراً تقريباً جنوب باب الاحد، ليمتد شرقا إلى برج سيدي مخلوف. وفي هذا العهد تم توحيد العدوتين (مدينة الرباط وسلا) تحت حكم دويلة أبي رقراق، التي أنشأها الموريسكيون. ومنذ ذلك الحين اشتهر مجاهدو القصبة بنشاطهم البحري، وعرفوا عند الأوربيين باسم «قراصنة سلا». وقد استمروا في جهادهم ضد البواخر الأوربية إلى غاية سنة 1829.\n\nعهد الإحتلال الفرنسي\nو في عام 1912 أصبحت الرباط المقر الرئيس للمقيم العام الفرنسي، وبعد الاستقلال ظلت عاصمة للمغرب.\n\nالسكان\nتضم المدينة 515,619 نسمة حسب (إحصاء 2024)\n\nمهاجرو الأندلس\nكانت الرباط مدينة مضيافة آوت الأندلسيين الذين لجؤوا إليها بعد طردهم من إسبانيا واستقروا فيها على موجات متلاحقة بين القرنين الثالث عشر والرابع عشر، وجاءت أولى هذه الموجات عام 1239م وكانت تضم مهاجرين من بلنسية وأنحاء أندلسية أخرى، وضمن الموجة الأخيرة، وصل آلاف الموريسكيين الذي طردوا بقرار من الملك فيليب الثالث في عام 1609م واستقروا في قصبة الوداية وبنوا المدينة الحالية، ولايزالون يحتفظون بفنونهم وصنائعهم الرفيعة، ولا تزال كنية بعض العائلات اليوم شاهدة على أصلها الأندلسي مثل، مُلين (العائلة الأموية الأصل) وتريدانو وبالأمينو وبيرو وفينجيرو وبركاش (أصلهم من نبلاء إسبانيا) وبالافريج وبن عمرو (العائلة الأنصارية الأصل) وغيرهم.\n\nالمعالم السياحية والطبيعية\nإن بابَيْ «الرواح» و«الأوداية» اللذان يقعان في الجانب الغربي من السور، ويتميزان بهندستهما المعمارية التاريخية وزخارفهما المشبّكة وأفاريزهما المنقوشة بعبارات كتبت بالخط الكوفي، يعتبران من الإنجازات المتميزة للفن الموحدي في أوج ازدهاره، وقد تحول البابان حاليا إلى صالات للمعارض الفنية خاصة الرسم، حيث يعرض برواقه أشهر الرسامين المغاربة والعالميين. ويتعيّن أيضا إبراز مكانة انقاض مسجد حسان الضخمة التي تمتد على مساحة هكتارين ونصف، وقد بقي المسجد دون أن يكتمل إنجازه، أما مئذنته الشهيرة فلا تزال شاهدا حيا على أكبر مشروع عمراني قام به الموحدون.\nبجواره نجد ضريح الملك الراحل محمد الخامس والذي دفن به ابنه الملك الحسن الثاني.\n\nقصبة الأوداية\nكانت قصبة الأوداية في الأصل قلعة محصنة، تم تشييدها من طرف المرابطين لمحاربة قبائل برغواطية، وازدادت أهميتها في عهد الموحدين، الذين جعلوا منها رباطاً على مصب وادي أبي رقراق لشن حملات عسكرية ضد الإسبان وأطلقوا عليها اسم المهدية. بعد الموحدين، أصبحت مهملة إلى أن استوطنها الموريسكيون الذين جاءوا من الأندلس، فأعادوا إليها الحياة بتدعيمها بأسوار محصنة وجعلها مقرا لدويلة أبي رقراق التاريخية. وفي عهد العلويين، عرفت قصبة الأوداية عدة تغييرات وإصلاحات ما بين سنة 1757 و1789، وكذلك ما بين سنة 1790 و1792. وقد عرف هذا الموقع تاريخاً متنوعاً ومتميزاً، يتجلى خصوصاً في المباني التي تتكون منها قصبة الأوداية. فسورها الموحدي وبابها الأثري (الباب الكبير) يعتبران من رموز الفن المعماري الموحدي، بالإضافة إلى مسجدها المعروف بالجامع العتيق.\nأما المنشآت العلوية فتتجلى في الأسوار الرشيدية، والقصر الأميري الذي يقع غرباً وكذلك منشأتها العسكرية كبرج صقالة.\n\nشالة\nبقيت شالة مهجورة منذ القرن الخامس حتى القرن العاشر الميلادي حيث تحول الموقع إلى رباط يتجمع فيه المجاهدون لمواجهة قبيلة برغواطة لكن هذه المرحلة التاريخية تبقى غامضة إلى أن اتخذ السلطان المريني أبو يوسف يعقوب سنة 1284م من الموقع مقبرة لدفن ملوك وأعيان بني مرين حيث شيد النواة الأولى لمجمع ضم مسجدا ودارا للوضوء وقبة دفنت بها زوجته أم العز. حضيت شالة على عهد السلطان أبي الحسن باهتمام بالغ. أما ابنه السلطان أبو عنان فقد أتم المشروع، فبنى المدرسة شمال المسجد والحمام والنزالة وزين أضرحة أجداده بقبب مزخرفة تعتبر نموذجا حيا للفن المعماري المتميز لدولة بني مرين.\nتراجعت شالة مباشرة بعد قرار المرينيين بإعادة فتح مقبرة القلة بفاس، فأهملت بناياتها، بل وتعرضت في بداية القرن الخامس عشر الميلادي للنهب والتدمير لتحتفظ بقدسيتها العريقة وتعيش بفضل ذكريات تاريخها القديم على هامش مدينة رباط الفتح، وتصبح تدريجيا مقبرة ومحجا لساكنة المنطقة، بل معلمة تاريخية متميزة تجتذب الأنظار. في القرن الرابع عشر الميلادي (1339) أحيط الموقع بسور خماسي الأضلاع مدعم بعشرين برجا مربعا وثلاث بوابات أكبرها وأجملها زخرفة وعمارة الباب الرئيسي للموقع المقابل للسور الموحدي لرباط الفتح. أما داخل الموقع فقد تم تشييد أربع مجموعات معمارية مستقلة ومتكاملة تجسد كلها عظمة ومكانة مقبرة شالة على العهد المريني. ففي الزاوية الغربية للموقع ترتفع بقايا النزالة التي كانت تأوي الحجاج والزوار وفي الجزء السفلي تنتصب بقايا المقبرة المرينية المعروفة بالخلوة، والتي تضم مسجدا ومجموعة من القبب أهمها قبة السلطان أبي الحسن وزوجته شمس الضحى، والمدرسة التي تبقى منارتها المكسوة بزخرفة هندسية متشابكة ومتكاملة وزليجها المتقن الصنع نموذجا أصيلا وأصليا للعمارة المغربية في القرن الرابع عشر.\nفي الجهة الجنوبية الشرقية للموقع يوجد الحمام المتميز بقبته النصف دائرية، التي تحتضن أربع قاعات متوازية:\n\nالأولى لخلع الملابس\nالثانية باردة\nالثالثة دافئة\nالرابعة أكثر سخونة.\nأما حوض النون، فيقع في الجهة الجنوبية الغربية للخلوة وقد كان في الأصل قاعة للوضوء لمسجد أبي يوسف، وقد نسجت حوله الذاكرة الشعبية خرافات وأساطير جعلت منه مزارا لفئة عريضة من ساكنة الرباط ونواحيها.\n\nالسور الموحدي\nشيد هذا السور من طرف السلطان يعقوب المنصور الموحدي، حيث يبلغ طوله 2263م، وهو يمتد من الغرب حتى جنوب مدينة الرباط، ويبلغ عرضه 2.5م وعلوه 10 أمتار وهذا السور مدعم ب 74 برجا، كما تتخلله 5 أبواب ضخمة.\n\nصومعة حسان\nتعد واحدة من بين المباني التاريخية المتميزة بمدينة الرباط التي تقع عليها عين الزائر، شيد من طرف السلطان يعقوب المنصور الموحدي، كان يعتبر من أكبر المساجد في عهده. لكن هذا المشروع الطموح توقف بعد وفاته سنة 1199م، كما تعرض للاندثار بسبب الزلزال الذي ضربه سنة 1755م.\nوتشهد آثاره على مدى ضخامة البناية الأصلية للمسجد، حيث يصل طوله إلى 180 مترا وعرضه 140 مترا، كما تشهد الصومعة التي تعد إحدى الشقيقات الثلاث لصومعة الكتبية بمراكش، والخيرالدا بإشبيلية على وجود المسجد وضخامته. هي مربعة الشكل تقف شامخة حيث يصل علوها 44 مترا، ولها مطلع داخلي ملتو، يؤدي إلى أعلى الصومعة ويمر على ست غرف تشكل طبقات. وقد زينت واجهاتها الأربع بزخارف ونقوش مختلفة على الحجر المنحوت وذلك على النمط الأندلسي المغربي من القرن الثاني عشر.\n\nضريح محمد الخامس\nيعد ضريح محمد الخامس من أهم المعالم الاثرية والسياحية في الرباط.\n\nدار السلطان\nتقع مغارة دار السلطان جنوب الرباط على الساحل المحيط الأطلسي. بيّنت طبقات الموقع وجود مستويات ترجع إلى الفترات التالية: العصر الحجري الأعلى ثم الفترة العاتيرية. هذه المغارة تكتسي أهمية كبيرة حيث تم العثور بها سنة 1975 على بقايا جمجمة إنسان يرجع إلى الفترة العاتيرية. هذه البقايا هي لإنسان عاقل مع وجود بعض الخصائص البدائية بالجمجمة.\n\nالروازي الصخيرات\nيقع هذا الموقع على بعد 30 كلم من الرباط وهو عبارة عن مقبرة تم اكتشافها سنة 1980. أسفرت حفريات الاتقاد التي تم القيام بها سنة 1982 على نتائج مهمة تخص العصر الحجري الحديث حيث تم اكتشاف بقايا الإنسان ومجموعة من اللقى الأثرية البالغة الأهمية: أواني خزفية، أواني من العاج وحلي من العاج....الفترة التاريخية التي تنتمي إليها هذه المقبرة هي العصر الحجري الحديث بمراحله الوسطى والحديثة والتي تؤرخ بحوالي 3800ق م.\n\nثقافة وفنون\nتعتبر الرباط عاصمة ثقافية، وهي أيضا مدينة المتاحف، وأهمها متحف محمد السادس للفن الحديث والمعاصر، ومتحف لوداية المقام في مبنى يعود للقرن السابع وتم ترميمه حاليا، يعرض قطعا فنية مختلفة من الخزف والحلي والمجوهرات والملابس التقليدية والمطرزات والسجاد والاسطرلابات وبعض المخطوطات من عصر الموحدين، أما على شاطئ النهر فيقع متحف الفنون الشعبية مقابل مجمع الصناعات التقليدية، حيث يمكن تأمل الحرفيين أثناء عملهم، ويقع متحف التاريخ والحضارات في المدينة الحديثة، ويقدم للزائر نماذج من القطع التي تعود إلى عصر ما قبل التأريخ، وأخرى إلى العصر الإسلامي الوسيط.\n\nالرباط هي أيضًا حاضنة لأهم المسارح وأكبرها في المملكة، حيث تضم المدينة المسرح الكبير للرباط والذي يعد أكبر مسرح في إفريقيا، إذ يمتد على مساحة 7 هكتارات و يتسع لـ 7000 مقعد، ويحتوي على قاعة للعروض تتسع لـ 1900 مقعد، إلى جانب جميع المرافق الضرورية. كما يتواجد بالمدينة مسرح محمد الخامس، وكذا عدة قاعات رسمية للمعارض التشكيلية، منها دار الفنون وقاعة باب الرواح. وفي القطاع المستقل، تعد الشقة 22 من أبرز الفضاءات الفنية وتقدم فنانين مغاربة وعالميين.\n\nالمعرض الدولي للنشر والكتاب\nتستضيف الرباط المعرض الدولي للنشر والكتاب الذي ينعقد سنويا في فضاء OLM بحي السويسي. يعتبر هذا المعرض من أكبر التظاهرات الثقافية التي تشهدها المملكة المغربية، ويقام في شهر مايو من كل عام لمدة عشرة أيام، تحت رعاية الملك محمد السادس، وبإشراف وزارة الثقافة والشباب والتواصل.\nيشارك في المعرض كل عام سواء بالحضور المباشر أو عبر التوكيلات عدد كبير من دور النشر المتخصصة في مختلف المجالات المعرفة العلمية والاجتماعية والسياسة والتربوية التعليمية والاقتصادية، والتي يبلغ عددها مايقارب (700) دار نشر أجنبية وعربية من (44) دولة، إضافة إلى المؤسسات الثقافية ومراكز البحوث والجمعيات والجامعات المختلفة، كما يتم تقديم الجائزة الوطنية للقراءة خلال هذا المعرض.\n\nمهرجان موازين\nتستضيف الرباط أيضًا مهرجان موازين وهو مهرجان موسيقي عالمي سنوي تأسس سنة 2001، يُنظم ما بين شهري مايو ويونيو من كل سنة تحت رعاية الملك محمد السادس والذي يُنظم من طرف شركة مغرب الثقافات، ويشارك فيه العديد من الفنانين الموسيقيين العالميين

وأمريكا وأفريقيا والعالم العربي.\n\nالاقتصاد\nالرباط هي العاصمة والمركز الحضري الأهم في جهة الرباط سلا القنيطرة والتي تُعتبر ثالث أكبر جهة من الناحية الاقتصادية في المغرب، وفي السنوات الأخيرة بدأت تصبح مركزًا لرجال الأعمال، ولهذا أطلقت المدينة مشاريع طموحة لجذب المستثمرين. \nتتميز المدينة باقتصاد متنوع يعتمد على مزيج من الصناعات المتطورة، التجارة المزدهرة، والخدمات البنكية المتقدمة. تحتضن المدينة صناعات حيوية مثل الصناعات الدوائية وصناعة السيارات التي تجذب الاستثمارات الكبرى. على صعيد التجارة، تشكل الأنشطة التجارية جزءًا هامًا من الاقتصاد المحلي، مع تواجد الأسواق التقليدية إلى جانب المراكز التجارية الحديثة. في القطاع المالي، تلعب البنوك الكبرى دورًا رئيسيًا، من حيث مساهمتها في تمويل المشاريع الصغيرة والمتوسطة، وكذا توفير مناخ مالي مستقر لجذب الاستثمارات. إضافة إلى ذلك، تعتمد المدينة على تجهيزات عصرية تشمل مناطق صناعية ومنصات لوجستية، مستفيدة من قربها من ميناء القنيطرة لتعزيز صادراتها وتطوير علاقاتها التجارية.\n\nالبنية التحتية\nالتعليم\nتضم الرباط أفضل الجامعات والمدارس والمعاهد ليس في المغرب فقط بل في الوطن العربي كله والتي درست وأخرجت أهم الشخصيات السياسية والاقتصادية التي أثرت في تاريخ المغرب.\nمن الأهم الجامعات الموجودة في الرباط نجد جامعة محمد الخامس والتي تعد من أقدم الجامعات الحديثة بالمغرب، كما نجد أيضا الجامعة الدولية للرباط.\nيوجد بجانب هذه الجامعات مدارس في تخصصات محددة مثل الطب والفن والهندسة على رأسهم جامعة الزهراوي الدولية لعلوم الصحة، والمدرسة الوطنية للهندسة المعمارية، والمعهد العالي للفن المسرحي والتنشيط الثقافي.\n\nالصحة\nمدينة الرباط هي موقع لأهم وأكبر المستشفيات في المغرب لعل أبرزها المركز الاستشفائي الجامعي ابن سينا الذي يعتبر ثاني أكبر مركز استشفائي جامعي في المغرب بعد المستشفى الجامعي بطنجة، ونجد أيضا المستشفى العسكري الدراسي والمستشفى الجامعي الدولي الشيخ خليفة و المستشفى الجامعي الشيخ زايد. بالإضافة إلى هذه المستشفيات نجد مصحات خاصة مثل مركز النخيل للأورام ومصحة أكدال ومصحة العاصمة.\n\nالرياضة\nملعب الأمير مولاي عبد الله هو ملعب كرة قدم افتتح رسميًا في 5 سبتمبر 2025، ويُعدّ من بين أكبر الملاعب في المغرب، حيث يتسع لـ 69,500 متفرج، ويقع على بعد حوالي 7 كيلومترات من وسط المدينة. ويُعتبر الملعب معقلًا لنادي الجيش الملكي وكذلك المنتخب المغربي لكرة القدم.\n\nالنقل والمواصلات\nالقطارات\nتخدم مدينة الرباط محطتان رئيسيتان للسكك الحديدية يديرهما المكتب الوطني للسكك الحديدية. محطة الرباط المدينة ومحطة الرباط أكدال هما المحطتان الرئيسيتان اللتان تربطان الرباط بباقي المدن، حيث تنطلق القطارات جنوباً إلى الدار البيضاء ومراكش والجديدة، شمالاً إلى طنجة، أو شرقاً إلى مكناس وفاس وتازة ووجدة. يوفر المكتب الوطني للسكك الحديدية خدمة كاملة عبر قطارته ويمكنك الحصول على مواصلات إلى مراكش وهي رحلة تمتد لـ 4 ساعات، فاس 2 ساعة (إذا كنت تأخذ أحد القطارات السريعة الجديدة، و 3 ساعات في القطارات الأخرى) والدار البيضاء ساعة واحدة.\n\nترامواي الرباط\nيعتبر مشروع التراموي الرابط بين المدينتين الرباط وسلا من الحلول الملائمة للمشكل الخاص بالنقل الحضري بهاتين المدينتين حيث يستجيب للطلب المتزايد على النقل ويوفر بديلا حقيقيا لاستعمال السيارات أشرف الملك محمد السادس، على تدشين خطي ترامواي الرباط – سلا، وقنطرة الحسن الثاني وذلك يوم الأربعاء 18 ماي 2011.\nيعد هذا المشروع من المشاريع التي تحظى بالأولوية في إطار مشروع تهيئة وتنمية ضفتي أبي رقراق، على اعتبار أنه يروم تسهيل حركة المرور والتنقل وتسهيل الربط بين العدوتين عبر اعتماد وسائل للنقل والمواصلات تحترم البيئة وتضمن شروط السلامة والانتظام في العمل. وتم إنجاز مجموع مكونات هذا المشروع، بعين المكان، من طرف مقاولات مغربية بمساعدة مكاتب للدراسات ومختبرات للمراقبة.\nوتتكون الشبكة الحالية للتراموي من خطين اثنين يصل مجموع طولهما إلى 5ر19 كلم، ويتوفران على 31 محطة. وتغطي الشبكة أهم الأقطاب الحضرية التي تشهد كثافة عالية من حيث عدد السكان وتنقلاتهم (الأحياء الجامعية، المستشفيات، الإدارات، مركزا المدينتين، أهم المحطات الطرقية والسككية). ويبلغ العدد الإجمالي للعربات التي سيتم توظيفها في شبكة ترامواي الرباط – سلا، والتي تم تصميمها وفق المعايير الدولية، 44 عربة، يصل طول كل منها إلى 32 متر. وتتوفر العربات على أجهزة التكييف وعلى جميع الولوجيات بالنسبة للأشخاص ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصة. وكان قد أعطى انطلاقة أشغال هذا المشروع الملك محمد السادس في 23 دجنبر 2007 حيث أشرفت على إنجازه وكالة تهيئة ضفتي أبي رقراق بشراكة مع الجماعات المحلية للرباط وسلا. وابتداء من شهر يناير 2009، أصبحت شركة تراموي الرباط سلا التي تضم بين مساهميها جماعتي الرباط وسلا تشرف على سير الأشغال. التراموي الذي شرع في استغلاله خلال هذه السنة، من المرتقب أن يقل حوالي 180 ألف راكب بين الرباط وسلا كل يوم عبر خطين أساسيين: \n\nالخط المهيكل للتجمع الحضري من حي كريمة بسلا إلى حي أكدال بالرباط على مسافة 7.11 كلم، ويشمل هذا الخط الأقطاب الرئيسية للمدينتين.\nخط خاص بسكان الأحياء ذات الكثافة السكانية المرتفعة، مثل حي يعقوب المنصور بالرباط وبطانة بمدينة سلا على مسافة 7.8 كلم.\n\nحافلات النقل الحضري\nفوض مرفق النقل الحضري بالمدينة وما جاورها لشركة ألزا وقد وضعت رهن إشارة مستعملي الحافلات حافلات من الطراز الرفيع وذات جودة عالية وايكولوجية، ووضعت أيضا شبكة من الخطوط المنتظمة التي تربط بين احياء العاصمة وايضا ضواحيها كسلا وتمارة والصخيرات وتامسنا وعين عودة...\n\nالطيران\nالمطار الرئيسي الذي يخدم مدينة الرباط هو مطار الرباط سلا الدولي، يتواجد فعليا في مدينة سلا على بعد 8 كلم من الرباط يبلغ طول المدرج 3500 متر وعرضه 45 متر.\nيحتل المطار المرتبة السادسة في المغرب من حيث عدد المسافرين، وتبلغ الطاقة الاستعابية للمطار 1.5 مليون مسافر في السنة. ولكونه يقع بجوار العاصمة الرباط، فهو المطار الرئيسي لإستقبال قادة الدول والبعثات الديبلوماسية الذين يزورون المغرب.\n\nمشروع تهيئة ضفتي أبي رقراق\nيعد مشروع تهيئة ضفتي أبي رقراق من المشاريع التنموية الكبرى التي ستضفي مساحة من الحداثة والإبداع والتميز على صورة الرباط وسلا وتبرز الخصوصيات التاريخية والتراثية والعمرانية للعاصمة الإدارية للمملكة. وينتظر بعد الانتهاء من هذا المشروع الطموح، وفق تصميم هندسي راق، أن تصبح الرباط نموذجا عالميا لازدهار سياحي واقتصادي وإضفاء جمالية تضيف لتاريخها وتراثها وثقافتها رصيدا غنيا. ويسعى مشروع تهيئة ضفتي أبي رقراق، إلى تطوير وتنمية المنطقة، وذلك بإعادة تأهيل المآثر التاريخية الموجودة بمحاذاة الوادي وربط هذه المعالم ببعضها بواسطة شبكة منظمة من الطرق والمسالك الاستكشافية.\nكما يتوخى هذا المشروع، الذي خصص لإنجاز بنياته التحتية مبلغ عشرة ملايير درهم يمولها صندوق الحسن الثاني للتنمية الاجتماعية الاقتصادية والمديرية العامة للجماعات المحلية، الجمع بين مهارة التصميم الحضري والمعماري وخاصية الأسس التاريخية التي ينبني عليها الموقع من أجل تهيئة عصرية تتلاءم مع الخصائص الذاتية للموقع وبلورة تصميم لمدينة منفتحة يتم التركيز في بناياتها على الواجهات والسطوح المفتوحة على السماء. وأوضح المدير العام لوكالة تهيئة ضفتي أبي رقراق السيد الصاقل المغاري، في حديث لوكالة المغرب العربي للأنباء، أن مشروع التهيئة ستكون له انعكاسات إيجابية على التنمية المحلية للرباط وسلا، وتحقيق نهضة حضرية ونمو اقتصادي من خلال تشييد واستغلال التجهيزات والبنيات التحتية للمنطقة عبر خلق مناصب شغل، وتحفيز الصناعات المرتبطة بالبناء والتجهيز والقطاعات المالية.\n\nباب البحر\nيوجد على بعد عشر دقائق من مطار الرباط سلا، بالضفة اليمنى لنهر أبي رقراق بمدينة الرباط قرب مدينة سلا ويعد هذا المشروع عملا ضخما، يطمح إلى تحويل مصبّ نهر أبي رقراق إلى قطب سياحي وحضري فعلي وبذلك الارتقاء بمدينة الرباط إلى مرتبة العواصم الكبرى بالبحر الأبيض المتوسط.\nويقع «باب البحر» بين مصب نهر أبي رقراق وقنطرة مولاي الحسن ويمتد على مساحة سبعين هكتار تقريبا، ثلاثين منها مساحات عقارية؛ إذ يضم مشروع «باب البحر» برنامجا عقاريا متنوعا بغلاف استثماري يقدر بسبعمائة وخمسين مليون دولار.\nوسيأوي المشروع عرضا متنوعا يشمل وحدات سكنية وفندقية ذات جودة عالية، العديد من المؤسسات التجارية ومركزا للأعمال يضم مكاتب ومهنيي قطاع الخدمات. كما سينبض القلب الحضري لهذا القطب على إيقاع متاجر، متاحف وأروقة فنية ممّا يزيد من تنوعه.\n\nقنطرة مولاي الحسن\nوهي عبارة عن جسر كبير يتوفر على ثلاثة ممرات، ومسلكين للترامواي الذي سيربط الرباط وسلا وممرات أخرى خاصة بالراجلين والدراجات كما تعمل على تسهيل حركة مرور البواخر إلى المارينات التي سيتم إحداثها في إطار مشروع «أمواج»، فضلا عن تسهيل حركة المرور النهري عبر واد أبي رقراق\nويعد مشروع هذه القنطرة من بين المشاريع التي تندرج في إطار الشطر الأول للمشروع الكبير لتهيئة وتنمية ضفتي أبي رقراق، والذي يعرف باسم «باب البحر» الممتد على نحو سبعين هكتارا سنة 2010\n\nنفق الأوداية\nهو مشروع يدخل ي إطار مخطط تهيئة ضفتي نهر أبي رقراق، سيمكن من تجاوز مشكل تدفقات حركة السير بطريق المرسى، الذي يعرف حاليا حركة سير مكثفة تصل في معدلها الأعلى إلى 30 ألف سيارة في اليوم، منها 3500 من الوزن الثقيل.\nوسيمتد هذا المشروع، الذي يربط بين «باب البحر» ونادي الرياضات على طول 1022 متر.\nويهدف هذا المشروع، بالخصوص، إلى إعادة التواصل التاريخي بين المدينة القديمة والأوداية، كما سيساعد على الحفاظ على الموقع التاريخي وسيعطيه قيمة سياحية أكبر، فضلا عن جعل حركة السير أكثر سيولة.\nوتقدر تكلفة بناء وتجهيز النفق بحوالي 491 مليون درهم، ومن المنتظر أن تنطلق حركة المرور به خلال الستة أشهر الأولى من سنة 2010.\n\nأبواب الرباط\nشخصيات مؤثرة\n• محمد السادس• الحسن الثاني• الأمير مولاي عبد الله• الأمير مولاي رشيد• عبد الإله ابن كيران•

      "content": "Rabat (en arabe : الرباط, ar-Ribāṭ ; en amazighe : ⵕⵕⴱⴰⵟ, Ṛṛbaṭ ; en arabe marocain : الرّباط, Rbaṭ) est la capitale du royaume du Maroc. La ville est située sur la côte l'Atlantique, au nord-ouest du Maroc, à 40 km au sud de Kénitra, à 240 km au sud-ouest de Tanger et du détroit de Gibraltar et à 87 km au nord-est de Casablanca. Elle est séparée de la ville de Salé par l'embouchure du Bouregreg, ce qui vaut au deux villes le surnom de « villes jumelles ».\nLors du dernier recensement de 2024, sa population était de 977 827 habitants, faisant de Rabat la 7e ville du royaume. Avec sa banlieue, elle forme la deuxième agglomération de ce pays après celle de Casablanca.\nDepuis 2012, un ensemble de sites de Rabat est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco. La ville a aussi reçu la deuxième place du classement CNN des « Meilleures destinations touristiques de 2013 ». En 2024, la ville de Rabat reçoit à l’unanimité le prix d'honneur à l'occasion du Programme des Nations unies pour les établissements humains (ONU-Habitat) 2024.\n\nHistoire\nLa ville a été fondée au XIIe siècle par les Almohades, qui y édifièrent une citadelle (devenue la kasbah des Oudayas), une mosquée et une résidence. C’était alors ce qu'on appelle un ribat (« forteresse »). Le nom actuel vient de Ribat Al Fath, « le Camp de la Victoire ». Plus tard, le petit-fils de Abd Al-Mūmin — Ya'qub al-Mansūr — agrandit et compléta la ville, l'entourant notamment de murailles. Par la suite, elle servit de base aux expéditions almohades en Andalousie.\nAprès 1269, quand les Mérinides choisirent Fès comme capitale, Rabat entra dans une période de déclin. Ainsi, l'explorateur morisque Hassan al-Wazzan a rapporté qu'il n'y subsistait que 100 maisons habitées en 1515. En 1609, à la suite du décret d’expulsion de Philippe III, 13 000 Morisques y trouvèrent refuge, revitalisant ainsi la ville. Jusqu'au XIXe siècle, Rabat est connue sous le nom de Salé-le-Neuf.\nEn 1912, Lyautey fit de Rabat le siège du résident général et la capitale du protectorat français au Maroc. En 1956, à l’indépendance du Maroc, la ville resta la capitale du pays.\n\nPréhistoire\nEn 1875, Bleicher signale pour la première fois l'existence d'outils lithiques au Maroc ; est cité entre autres le site Douar Doum à Rabat.\nUne carrière d'exploitation dans le quartier de Kébibat a livré en 1933 les plus anciens fossiles humains trouvés au Maroc (à la date de 2004), soit 23 fragments de boîte crânienne, sans industrie lithique associée. Leurs caractéristiques ont induit plusieurs hypothèses successives. Marçais (1934) en fait un Atlanthrope. Vallois (1958/1959) leur attribue un mélange de Néandertalien et de Sinanthrope. Jaranof (1945) les dit moustériens. Ferembach (1975) les attribue à l'Acheuléen moyen. Au début des années 2000, ils sont dits du Tensiftien, contemporain du Riss, l'avant-dernière glaciation. La stratigraphie du site a été interprétée en 1959 par G. Choubert.\nLes falaises du littoral océanique entre Rabat et Tébibat sont elles aussi riches en vestiges préhistoriques : Dar-es-Soltane I et II, El Harhoura I et II, grotte des Contrebandiers (appelée de nos jours El Mnasra).\n\nFondation et développement sous les Almohades\nLa première trace urbaine à Rabat se situe à l'actuelle kasbah des Oudaïas, les Almoravides y ayant fondé un fort pour organiser les attaques contre les tribus du royaume hérétique des Berghouata non loin des ruines de l'ancienne cité romaine de Sala Colonia. La dynastie des Almohades fit édifier, en 1150, à la place de l'ancien fort sanhadja des Almoravides, un ribat (ou forteresse), lieu de rassemblement des combattants de la foi, point d’étape dans l’épopée almohade pour la conquête de l’Andalousie et le contrôle du reste du Maghreb. Le calife Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur se disait désireux de concevoir, quant à la position du Bouregreg, des projets plus vastes capables d'éclipser les grandes métropoles abbassides de l'Orient islamique.\nAidé des nombreux captifs ramenés d’Espagne après la bataille d'Alarcos, il fit construire les remparts de la future capitale et commencer, non loin du fleuve, une mosquée aux proportions grandioses ; mais cette dernière ne fut pas achevée : seul se dresse son minaret, qui servit de repère aux navigateurs pour le franchissement de la ville. À ce camp retranché fut d'abord appliqué le nom de « Ribat de Salé », puis celui de « Ribat El-Fath » ('le Camp de la Victoire'), après la victoire des armées almohades en Espagne.\nCette construction, qui correspond en gros à la partie ouest de l’actuelle kasbah des Oudaïas, fut aussi appelée « al-Mahdiyya », en souvenir d’al-Mahdî Muhammad ibn Tûmart, fondateur du mouvement almohade. À partir du Ribat d’Abd al-Mumin, son[Qui ?] fils Abu Yaqub Yusuf, puis son petit-fils Yacoub el-Mansour, héritiers d’un empire s'étendant de la Castille à la Tripolitaine, à cheval sur l'Europe et l'Afrique, ont construit une cité imposante, couvrant plus de quatre cents hectares, enceinte de murailles imposantes percées de portes monumentales et qui devait être dotée d'une mosquée gigantesque, la tour Hassan (restée inachevée, et puis détruite durant le séisme de 1755), mais qui eut été l'un des plus grands sanctuaires du monde musulman.\nAinsi, bien que Ribat al Fath ne reçût jamais la population que son enceinte aurait pu abriter, les grandes orientations de la ville étaient tracées. Les remparts, les portes monumentales de l’époque, le minaret et les vestiges de la mosquée de Hassan témoignent aujourd'hui encore de l’ampleur de la ville almohade, sur un site dont le caractère sacré a été accentué et revalorisé par l'édification du mausolée Mohammed V, symbole de piété filiale qui, de par sa décoration exceptionnelle, œuvre d'art collective, est un hommage au souverain qui y repose et un témoignage de la renaissance de l'artisanat traditionnel[évasif].\n\nPhase de déclin\nDe la fin de la période almohade, vers le milieu du XIIIe siècle, jusqu'au début du XVIIe siècle, l’importance de Rabat diminua considérablement.\nLa dynastie zénète des Mérinides fonda le Jama' el-Kbîr, ainsi que d'autres ruelles, toutes situées au cœur de l'actuelle médina. La localisation de cet équipement public permet d’affirmer que la vie citadine n’était pas concentrée uniquement aux abords immédiats de la kasbah et que plusieurs quartiers de l'actuelle médina étaient habités.\n\nRépublique du Bouregreg\nÀ partir de 1610, Rabat reçut une forte population de réfugiés morisques chassés de l'ancienne Al-Andalus par le roi d'Espagne Philippe III. Les réfugiés s’établirent dans la kasbah et à l'intérieur de l'enceinte almohade, dans la partie nord-ouest qu'ils délimitèrent et protégèrent par une nouvelle enceinte, la muraille andalouse. Les descendants de ces Morisques, qui portent souvent des patronymes hispaniques tels que Dinia (Dénia, ville en Espagne dans la commune autonome de Valence), Guédira, Mouline (Molina), Bargach (Vargas), Karrakchou (Carracso/Carrasco), Moreno, Balafrej (Palafres), Ronda ou Tamourro (Chamorro) sont toujours considérés comme les Rabatis dits « de souche ».\nPendant quelques dizaines d’années, Rabat, alors connue en Europe sous le nom de Salé-le-Neuf, fut le siège d'une cité-État, la république du Bouregreg, jusqu’à l’avènement des Alaouites, qui s’emparèrent de l’estuaire en 1666. Sa principale activité était la course en mer contre les chrétiens, notamment contre les Espagnols, qui lui procurait la totalité de ses ressources. La république salétine devint ainsi un des principaux centres de la course barbaresque en Afrique du Nord, en concurrence avec les Ottomans qui dominaient Alger, Tunis et Tripoli. Les corsaires de Salé-le-Neuf s'aventuraient très loin dans l'océan Atlantique, parfois jusqu'en Islande et jusqu'à Terre-Neuve, au large de l'actuel Canada.\n\nRabat sous les Alaouites\nRabat devient une ville impériale dans la seconde moitié du XVIIIe siècle, sous le règne du sultan Mohammed III (1757-1790), qui y fait édifier un palais et une mosquée. Un de ses successeurs, Moulay Slimane (1792-1822), vient y résider durant les grandes révoltes siba qui frappent le Moyen-Atlas et menacent Fès, et y fait également construire une mosquée. Sa décision d'arrêter la course barbaresque entraîne le déclin de l'activité maritime de la ville.\nUne publication de 1901 rappelle l'existence à Rabat du quartier juif, appelé au Maroc « mellah », reconstruit vers 1811, où se trouvent de nombreux marchands juifs et seize synagogues au début du XXe siècle.\n\nProtectorat français\nEn 1912, dans le cadre de l'instauration du protectorat français au Maroc, le général Lyautey décide de transférer la capitale de Fès à Rabat (en raison de la forte agitation des tribus autour de Fès). Le sultan Moulay Youssef y déménage quelques mois plus tard. En 1913, Lyautey fait appel à Jean Claude Forestier, qui rédige un rapport sur l'aménagement urbain des grandes villes marocaines, puis il engage Henri Prost en 1914 pour dessiner la « Ville nouvelle » destinée à abriter les institutions du protectorat et la population européenne.\n\nAprès l'indépendance\nEn 1956, à la fin du protectorat, le sultan Sidi Mohammed Ben Youssef (Mohammed V) maintient Rabat comme capitale. Son fils Hassan II, en 1961, et son petit-fils Mohammed VI en 1999, confirment ce choix, tout en alternant les séjours dans les différents palais du royaume, selon la tradition des souverains chérifiens.\nDe la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale et jusqu'en 1963, les États-Unis disposèrent d'une base militaire aérienne à Rabat.\n\nCulture et patrimoine\nPatrimoine mondial\nDepuis juin 2012, un ensemble de sites de la ville de Rabat est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco en tant que bien culturel : la « ville nouvelle » (édifiée au début du protectorat), la kasbah des Oudayas, le jardin d'Essais, la médina, les remparts et portes almohades, les sites du Chellah ou de la mosquée Hassan (dont la « tour Hassan » est le minaret), le mausolée Mohammed-V et le quartier habous de Diour Jamaâ.\n\nEnceintes et fortifications\nProtégeant les faces sud et ouest de la ville, une enceinte importante fut construite par les Almohades à la fin du XIIe siècle. Elle est composée de deux longues murailles rectilignes, se coupant à angle aigu, d’une longueur totale de plus de cinq kilomètres, d’une épaisseur de plus de deux mètres et d’une hauteur moyenne d'environ huit mètres.\nAinsi fut enfermée une superficie de près de quatre cent-vingt hectares, englobant le plateau supérieur qui domine aujourd’hui le Chella, pour assurer, en cas d’attaque, la sécurité des parties basses de la ville. Le rempart ouest était percé de quatre portes, à intervalles assez réguliers : Bab El-Alou, Bab El-Had, Bab Er-Rouah et Bab El-Hdid, la dernière étant incluse dans l’actuel Palais royal. Le rempart sud n'en comportait qu’une seule, Bab Zaër. Comme la plupart des murailles édifiées par les Almohades, cette enceinte construite en béton d'une grande solidité, riche en chaux grasse, a admirablement résisté. Régulièrement flanquée de tours carrées, sa courtine est couronnée d'un chemin de ronde, bordé à l’extérieur d’un parapet aux merlons coiffés de pyramidions.\nBab Er-Rouah, chef-d’œuvre d’esthétique monumentale en pierre, déploie, tout comme la porte de la Kasbah, un décor d’entrelacs autour de l’ouverture en forme d’arc outrepassé inscrit dans un encadrement rectangulaire. Comme à Bab Agnaou à Marrakech, de grands arcs reprennent, en l’élargissant, le mouvement de l’arc même de la porte, l’entourant d’une auréole sinueuse aux pointes aiguës, surmontée d’une large frise à inscription coufique.\nAu début du XVIIe siècle, des réfugiés musulmans chassés d’Espagne s’installent dans la Kasbah ainsi que dans une partie d’une centaine d’hectares à l’intérieur de l’enceinte almohade, qu’ils délimitent par l’édification d’une nouvelle muraille. Partant à proximité de Bab El-Had, cette dernière relie la courtine du XIIe siècle à la falaise dominant le Bouregreg, au Borj Sidi Makhlouf. Rectiligne et flanquée de tours barlongues, la muraille andalouse qui s’étendait sur plus de 1 400 mètres, était haute en moyenne de cinq mètres et large de plus d’1,5 mètre. Elle était percée de trois portes : Bab Et-Tben (aujourd'hui abattue, cette porte était située près de l’actuel marché municipal), Bab El-Bouiba et Bab-Chella.\nPar ailleurs, au début du XIXe siècle, un nouveau rempart extérieur, d’une longueur totale de 4 300 mètres, fut édifié. Il prolongeait au sud l'enceinte almohade et la doublait à l’ouest jusqu'à l'océan Atlantique, enfermant ainsi une superficie totale de plus de 840 hectares. Cette dernière fortification avait une hauteur moyenne de 4 mètres et une épaisseur légèrement inférieure à 1 mètre. Quatre portes au total y étaient percées : Bab El-Qebibât, Bab Tamesna, Bab Marrakech et Bab El-Msalla. Ce rempart alaouite a été détruit en grande partie pour faciliter l’aménagement de la ville européenne durant le protectorat. À partir des principales portes de la médina partaient les routes reliant, notamment, Rabat à Casablanca, à Marrakech, et à Fès.\nAux abords de l'enceinte almohade se tenaient des marchés hebdomadaires, tel celui de Souq el-Had, à proximité de la porte du même nom. Par ailleurs, entre l'enceinte alaouite et la muraille almohade étaient situés, au sud, l'Agdal, relié au Palais royal et, au nord, des jardins d'orangers dont les fruits, très prisés pour leur qualité, étaient exportés en Europe, comme l'attestent de nombreux documents d'archives.\n\nListe de monuments\nLa kasbah des Oudayas : ribat surplombant l'embouchure de l'oued Bou Regreg où se trouve le musée des Oudayas. Le ribat conçu à l'origine est devenu l'abri du musée national des Bijoux.\nLa tour Hassan : ruines de la mosquée bâtie par Ya'qub al-Mansūr, détruite au moment du séisme de 1755 à Lisbonne et le mausolée de Mohammed V, où reposent le défunt roi Mohammed V et ses deux fils, le défunt roi Hassan II et son frère cadet Moulay Abdellah.\nLa nécropole de Chella : bâtie en 1339, Chella était une ancienne agglomération phénicienne, carthaginoise et romaine.\nLa section monumentale de l'avenue Mohammed V et la mosquée Sunna : l'avenue Mohammed V prend naissance au pied de la mosquée Sunna pour se terminer au boulevard El Alou, après un cheminement de plusieurs kilomètres à travers la ville, en passant par le Parlement, la Banque d'État du Maroc et plusieurs immeubles coloniaux.\nPalais royal (Dâr-al-Makhzen) : le palais royal et le siège du gouvernement où travaillent et résident plus de 2 000 personnes. On accède au palais par une vaste esplanade, le « Méchouar ».\nBab ar-Rouah et l'avenue des Forces armées royales (FAR) : la plus célèbre des portes monumentales de Rabat veut dire, selon les uns « porte des vents », selon d'autres « porte du retour ». De l'époque Almohade, comme Bab Oudaïa, elle surprend par la richesse de sa décoration. Il s'agissait de la seule porte d'accès à Rabat, par voie terrestre.\nL'ancienne médina : bordée au nord par le Bouregreg, protégée de l'océan à l'ouest par les murs d'enceintes de la Kasbah des Oudayas, elle est ceinturée à l'est par les murailles almohades et au sud par le mur des Andalous qui sépare la ville nouvelle de la ville ancienne.\nBab El Had : construite à la fin du XIIe siècle par Yaacoub El Mansour. Il s'agit de l'une des portes qui forment la muraille des Almohades. « El Had » veut dire en arabe « le fil de l'épée » (Had Essayf). Elle a été nommée ainsi car c'était devant cette porte qu'on exécutait les meurtriers devant la foule à l'aide d'un sabre. Ces exécutions se tenaient en public pour faire comprendre aux entrants à la ville que les meurtres n'y étaient pas tolérés.\n\nLieux de culte\nParmi les lieux de culte, il y a principalement des mosquées. Il y a aussi des églises et des temples chrétiens : Archidiocèse de Rabat (Église catholique), Église évangélique au Maroc (Communion mondiale d'Églises réformées), Église orthodoxe russe de Rabat.\n\nCulture\nLa médina : construite au XVIIe siècle pour accueillir les réfugiés d'Andalousie, elle est aujourd'hui connue pour son mellah (ancien quartier juif), son souk couvert Es-Sebat dans la rue des Consuls, deux zawiya Tijani connues dans le monde entier pour être liées à Sidi Larbi Ben Sayeh, et toutes autres sortes de boutiques diversifiées.\nLe parc Ibn-Sina : appelé communément « parc Hilton » en raison de sa proximité avec l'hôtel situé juste à côté, désormais Sofitel. Le parc est aussi le poumon vert de l'agglomération avec des plantations de pins et d'eucalyptus.\nLe jardin d'Essais : situé au milieu de la ville et divisé en deux par l'avenue de la Victoire.\nLa ceinture verte de Rabat : c'est une forêt protégée séparant Rabat de Témara.\nLe golf et le palais Dar es-Salam : golf de 45 trous qui abrite chaque année le prestigieux trophée international de golf Hassan-II.\nLa Villa des arts : petit établissement abritant des expositions, et nombre d'activités pour étudiants.\nL'avenue Mohammed V située en plein centre de Rabat, le long de laquelle se trouvent le Parlement et de nombreux cafés et magasins.\nL'Agdal : ancien quartier européen, c'est un important centre d'activité de la ville, on y trouve les principaux établissements universitaires et hospitaliers (CHU Ibn Sina et plusieurs cliniques privées), de nombreuses agences gouvernementales, de nombreux magasins pour le shopping dont le grand mall d’Arribat Center.\nLe nouveau centre d'affaires et administratif Hay Riad (spécialement l'avenue Annakhil et le Mahaj Riad).\nLa marina de Bouregreg.\nLes plages allant de Harhoura à Skhirat.\nLe festival Mawazine qui se tient annuellement pendant la fin du mois de mai et le début du mois de juin, qui dure une semaine et qui est étendu sur toute la ville. (il a attiré deux millions de spectateurs en 2009).\nLe Musée Mohamed VI d'art moderne et contemporain : premier musée d'art contemporain au Maroc, ouvert depuis 2014. Des expositions y sont organisées, à côté d'une collection permanente comprenant plus de trois cents œuvres d'artistes contemporains marocains.\nLe Musée de l'histoire et des civilisations, ouvert depuis 2017.\n\nInstitutions et espaces culturels\nLe théâtre national Mohammed-V est l’une des plus grandes institutions culturelles de Rabat. La majeure partie des spectacles y sont coorganisés avec les instituts culturels européens.\nLes galeries officielles sont Bâb Er-Rouah, Bab El-Kébir aux Oudayas et Mohamed El-Fassi.\nRabat compte aussi des espaces indépendants, le plus emblématique étant L'appartement 22, fondé en 2002 par Abdellah Karroum, pour la production, l'exposition et les rencontres des cultures vivantes.\nDes grands projets culturels sont lancés dans les années 2000, notamment celui de la Bibliothèque nationale, du musée des Arts contemporains et de l’Institut supérieur de la musique et de la danse.\nEn 2006, la Fondation ONA inaugure à Rabat son second lieu culturel, la Villa des arts.\n\nGéographie\nLocalisation\nRabat se situe au cœur de la vallée du Bouregreg.\nLes préfectures limitrophes sont les préfectures de Salé, de Skhirate-Témara et de Khemisset.\n\nClimat\nLe climat de la ville est un climat de type méditerranéen, sujet aux quatre saisons bien marquées. Les hivers sont frais et pluvieux, avec des minima nocturnes pouvant descendre en dessous de 5 °C, ou parfois atteindre les 0 °C, et des journées agréables autour de 17 °C. Les gelées sont relativement rares. Les étés sont modérément chauds, la température dépassant rarement 30 °C. Par contre, les nuits sont toujours fraîches et l'humidité de l'air océanique se fait nettement ressentir.\nPrincipalement au printemps et en été, s'invite parfois le chergui, vent du désert sec et brûlant qui soufle de l'est et fait brusquement monter la température, de temps à autre au-dessus de 30 °C mais rarement pendant plus de trois journées successives, avant un retour de la brise océanique d'ouest.\nLa ville appartient au domaine bioclimatique sub-humide, et la moyenne annuelle de précipitation est de 555 mm.\nLa durée annuelle d'ensoleillement est 2 916 heures. La moyenne annuelle de précipitation s’élève à 76 jours, concentrés entre octobre et avril. Les chutes de neige sont rares.\nLe record absolu de chaleur est de 45,8 °C (enregistré en août 2010), tandis que le record absolu de froid est de −3,2 °C (enregistré en janvier 2005). La moyenne annuelle de température dans la ville est 17 °C.\nLe climat de Rabat ressemble beaucoup à celui du sud-ouest de la péninsule Ibérique.\n\nAdministration et politique\nOrganisation administrative\nSur le plan administratif, la ville de Rabat — à distinguer de l’agglomération rabataise, qui inclue sa banlieue — correspond à la préfecture de Rabat. Son territoire s’étend sur une superficie de 118,5 km2. Depuis le retour au principe de l'unité de la ville en 2002, il englobe, d'une part, la commune urbaine de Rabat, elle-même divisée en cinq arrondissements, et, d'autre part, la commune urbaine de Touarga. Ainsi, le quartier de Touarga, qui est enclavé dans la commune de rabat et où se situe le palais royal, dispose d'un statut particulier.\n\nQuartiers\nArrondissement Hassan\nL'arrondissement de Hassan est constitué d'une multitude de quartiers. Ce sont les quartiers les plus anciens de la ville.\nLa Kasbah des Oudayas, ancienne forteresse devant protéger des invasions maritimes venue de l'Océan Atlantique, constitue l’un de ces quartiers. Elle prend son nom de la tribu des Oudayas, venue en tant que garde royale à Rabat. Ce quartier a changé plusieurs fois de fonction jusqu'à devenir un quartier résidentiel pendant le XIXe siècle.\nAutre quartier, la médina est le cœur historique de la ville. « Médina » signifiant simplement 'ville' en arabe, le quartier est appelé « mdina kdima » par les habitants : 'la vieille ville'. La médina a pris son importance après l'arrivée des Andalous venus en masse pendant l'inquisition espagnol. Elle est elle-même divisée en plusieurs quartiers tels que Boukroun, El Gza, Oukassa, etc. \nLe mellah est le quartier juif de la médina. Il a été fondé en 1808 par le même ingénieur qui a fondé le mellah de Salé. Il ne reste plus qu'une dizaine de familles juives à Rabat depuis que la majorité des habitants juifs historiques a quitté le Maroc[Quand ?].\nLe quartier de Hassan (ancien quartier de la Tour Hassan) est le premier quartier européen de Rabat situé à l'intérieur de la muraille almohade rester vide jusqu'au protectorat français, le quartier reste aujourd'hui très vivant et surtout au niveau de l'Avenue Mohammed V qui regroupe la plupart des bâtiment officiel comme la Gare Rabat Ville et l'ancien siège de Bank Al-Maghrib.[incompréhensible] En hauteur se trouve le quartier de la Résidence, qui tient son nom de l'ancienne Résidence générale, devenue le Ministère de l'intérieur. Ce quartier abrite un grand nombre de ministères. À coté, on trouve le quartier des Touargas, situé à l’intérieur de la muraille alaouites. C’est là que se trouve le palais royal.\nDu côté atlantique se trouve le quartier de l'Océan. Initialement une extension du quartier de Saniya Gharbiya, ce quartier a accueilli les maisons de familles rabaties de souche plus ou moins aisées. C’est un quartier multiculturel, qui a abrité[Quand ?] des communautés marocaine, française, espagnole et portugaise. Le quartier de l'Océan a été pendant très longtemps un pôle de la vie culturelle de la ville.\nMarassa est le premier quartier extra-muros édifié par des familles rabaties bourgeoises. Il s’étend sur une zone comprise entre Bab El Had et l'ancien cimetière juif. De grandes figures politiques marocaines ont vécus dans ce quartier caractérisé par ses maisons traditionnelles qui rappellent la médina.\nLe quartier Diour Jamaa a accueilli[Quand ?] une population de la classe moyenne. Il a été conçu dès 1917 par l’administration coloniale en partenariat avec l’administration des habous[Quoi ?] pour dépeupler la médina, qui accueillait l'exode rural depuis le nouveau statut de Rabat en tant que capitale.\nLes quartiers de Qbibat et d’Akkari sont des extentions de Diour Jamaa. Qbibat a d'abord accueilli[Quand ?] des européens de milieux défavorisées avant d'être habité[Quand ?] par des marocains. Le nom de « Qbibat » provient de « Bab Qbibat », qui tient son nom de « Kasr Qbibat » (Kasr Al Bahr, l’actuel Four Seasons Hotel). Le quartier accueille l'église orthodoxe russe. Le quartier d’Akkari a été fondé[Quand ?] par la famille éponyme. Il accueille les cimetières chrétien (PAX) et juif, ainsi que des logements traditionnels.\n\nÉconomie\nRabat est la deuxième agglomération du pays après Casablanca. Ces dernières années, Rabat a commencé à devenir un centre d'affaires, profitant de la restructuration et de la réorganisation des administrations publiques ainsi que l'installation de sociétés étrangères et la création de zones off-shores.\nLa ville est le siège de plusieurs grandes entreprises marocaines et de multinationales présentes au Maroc telles que Thales, Holcim, KPMG, Maroc Telecom, la Caisse de dépôt et de gestion, le Crédit agricole du Maroc et Poste Maroc.\n\nLes projets d'aménagement de Rabat\nLa ville de Rabat, à l'image du reste du Maroc, compte aujourd'hui de nombreux projets d'aménagements ambitieux[évasif], démarrés ou en gestation. Ces projets doivent permettre de répondre aux besoins d'une population en forte croissance (la conurbation de Rabat incluant les villes de Salé, Skhirat et Temara, compte désormais plus de 3 millions d'habitants). Il s'agit également de créer des infrastructures de transport, aujourd'hui peu développées et incapables de faire face aux déplacements quotidiens des habitants dans le cadre de leur activité professionnelle. Rabat ambitionne également de devenir une véritable capitale culturelle du pays, ce qui se traduit par la multiplication de projets comme la grande bibliothèque, le futur grand théâtre national au bord du Bouregreg, le musée de l'histoire et des civilisations (ex-musée archéologique), le musée d'art contemporain, et l'organisation de plusieurs Festivals au cours de l'année comme le Festival Mawazine.\n\nLes projets d'aménagement de la vallée du Bouregreg\nL'aménagement de la vallée du Bouregreg séparant les villes de Rabat et Salé est un projet majeur pour le Maroc. Lancé en 2006, il doit concerner à terme 6 000 hectares. L'objectif du projet est de construire, dans cette zone en partie inondable et faiblement ou pas aménagée, des nouveaux quartiers multifonctionnels assurant la transition entre les deux agglomérations en valorisant le potentiel de l'axe fluvial avec la nouvelle marina et le patrimoine architectural des deux villes. Le projet doit également permettre d'améliorer la communication entre les deux villes. Il est piloté par un établissement public créé pour la circonstance, l’Agence pour l'aménagement de la vallée du Bouregreg (AAVB).\nSix phases sont prévues dont deux ont commencé en 2009. La première, dénommée Bab Al Bahr, représente un montant d’investissement de 750 millions de dollars et comprend un programme immobilier mixte de près de 560 000 m2 de plancher, sur trente hectares. Pour la réalisation de cette première séquence, qui vise à créer une cité de culture, de tourisme et de loisirs, l'agence s'est jointe à Al Maabar d'Abou Dhabi. Les aménagements situés sur la rive gauche de l'oued entre son embouchure et le pont Hassan II comprennent des ensembles hôteliers et résidentiels de qualité, la Cité des arts et métiers destinée à la préservation du savoir-faire artisanal et un port de plaisance. La construction d'un pont doté d'un tirant d'air plus élevé[Quoi ?] et le dragage de l'oued doivent permettre d'accueillir des bateaux ayant des tirants d'eau plus importants. Pour les pêcheurs professionnels de Salé et Rabat chassés par les aménagements en cours, un port de pêche est en cours de construction à l'embouchure de l'oued, côté Rabat.\n\nLes autres projets d'aménagement immobiliers de Rabat\nSephira\nLe projet Sephira porte sur l'aménagement de la corniche du littoral atlantique sur une longueur de 11 km et une superficie de 330 ha entre Bab El Bahr (près des Oudaîas) et Harhoura (Témara). Le projet prévoit à terme la réalisation entre autres de résidences, d'hôtels, de tours d'affaires, dont une de 50 étages, d'un centre commercial et d'une marina internationale. Le projet est confié à un groupe des Émirats : le terrain est cédé pour un dirham symbolique en échange de la construction des infrastructures. Le démarrage du programme, toujours en suspens[Quand ?], a été reporté plusieurs fois.\n\nAkrach\nLe projet Akrach est une extension de la ville de Rabat qui doit permettre de loger 200 000 habitants sur le plateau du même nom, situé au sud de l'agglomération. Le projet à l'étude depuis quelques années est toujours en suspens (2009).\n\nCentre multifonctionnel d’Agdal\nLe projet de CGI[Quoi ?] (centre multifonctionnel d'Agdal) devrait comporter un centre commercial, un hôtel, un fitness club et des bureaux. Arribat Center[incompréhensible]\n\nTamesna\nUne ville nouvelle, baptisée Tamesna et considérée comme une ville-satellite de Rabat, est en cours de construction à 30 km au sud-est de Rabat, sur un terrain situé en amont de l’oued Ikem. Elle a vocation à accueillir à son achèvement vers 2015 250 000 habitants dans 50 000 logements dont 10 000 logements sociaux.\n\nRyad al Andalous\nSur l'emplacement de l'ancien zoo de Rabat, qui est situé entre les quartiers Hay Riad et Témara, va naître un projet touristique et immobilier (Ryad al Andalous) avec allée de gratte-ciels et d'autres tours ainsi que des logements, loisirs, mall... Un nouveau zoo national est construit juste à côté du complexe sportif Moulay Abdellah en utilisant la recette de la vente du terrain de l'ancien zoo au promoteur (420 MDH[Quoi ?]). Les travaux de construction ont débuté en juillet 2008 et se sont achevés en décembre 2011, pour l'inauguration officielle le 9 janvier 2012 et l'ouverture au public le 14 janvier 2012.\n\nTransports\nLe réseau de transports en commun de Rabat est constitué de bus, gérés par la société Alsa depuis août 2019, et de tramways, exploités par le groupe Transdev via la Société du Tramway de Rabat-Salé. Le prix des parkings, très élevé, ainsi que la difficulté de trouver une place de stationnement et les bouchons découragent l’usage de la voiture.[évasif] Une ligne ferroviaire électrifiée à double voie relie Rabat aux villes voisines de Salé et de Casablanca et au reste du Maroc ; elle est empruntée pour les trajets à courte distance par le RER[Quoi ?] en direction de Témara, Bouqnadel et Salé, tandis que la majorité des habitants faisant la navette entre Casablanca, Rabat et Kénitra empruntent le train navette rapide (TNR) sous forme de voitures M6 (Wagon à double étage) qui assure une desserte en une heure avec une fréquence à la demi-heure. Rabat comporte deux gares : Rabat-Ville dans l'arrondissement Hassan et Rabat-Agdal dans la continuité de l'hypercentre, l'Agdal. Les personnes habitant en lointaine banlieue utilisent généralement leur véhicule personnel pour rejoindre le réseau urbain.\nRabat partage avec Salé l'aéroport de Rabat-Salé, d'une capacité de 3,5 millions de passagers, dont le trafic a atteint 485 000 passagers en 2013.\n\nTransports routiers\nPont Hassan-II et tunnel des Oudayas\nPour décongestionner le trafic sur l'axe reliant Salé à Rabat, un nouveau pont doté de deux fois trois voies a remplacé l'ancien pont Moulay-al-Hassan : le pont Hassan II. Ce nouveau pont est doté de deux fois trois voies, contre 2 × 2 voies pour l’ancien. Il permet ainsi un trafic fluide sur la traversée du fleuve.[évasif] De plus, deux lignes de tramway y traversent le fleuve du Bouregreg, permettant non seulement d'assurer le transport des Rabattais et des Salétins mais aussi de réduire le nombre de bus traversant le pont — principale source de bouchons.\nLe tunnel des Oudayas permet aujourd'hui de réduire la congestion automobile dans l'axe allant du pont Hassan II jusqu'à l'océan en passant par un important site touristique de Rabat, la Kasbah des Oudayas. De plus, celui-ci va permettre, grâce à la déviation du trafic de l'avenue Al Marsa vers le tunnel, la concrétisation du projet de zone piétonne entre les Oudayas et la médina de Rabat, qui était autrefois une avenue très chargée.\n\nL'autoroute de contournement\nL'autoroute de contournement de Rabat, d'une longueur de 42 km, a été inaugurée le 7 juillet 2016. Elle comprend notamment le plus long pont à haubans d'Afrique, le pont Mohammed VI\nCette grande rocade, dont les travaux de réalisation ont été lancés en février 2011 et achevés en juillet 2016, relie les grands axes autoroutiers desservant le sud, le centre, le nord et l’est du Maroc. Elle permettra de réduire les délais de transport tout en allégeant la circulation à l'intérieur du périmètre urbain de Rabat.\n\nTransports urbains\nTramway\nLa ville de Rabat dispose depuis mai 2011 de deux lignes de tramway, d'une longueur totale de 22 km. Les lignes desservent à la fois Salé et Rabat selon un axe nord-sud avec un tronc commun de 3 km du centre-ville de Rabat jusqu'à l'entrée de Salé, après le franchissement du Bouregreg via le pont Hassan-II. Les 41 stations sont desservies par des rames doubles Citadis d'une longueur totale de 60 mètres.\n\nRéseau de bus\nL'agglomération dispose d'un réseau de bus, réaménagé depuis août 2019, et exploité par un groupement composé des entreprises Alsa et City Bus Transport. Le réseau est composé d'une quarantaine de lignes reliant les villes de Rabat, Salé et Témara.\nLes bus sont de types Scania Higer et Mercedes-benz Conecto (de 12 m et articulés de 18 m).\nLe nombre de véhicules dépasse 350 bus et l’entreprise souhaite renforcer la flotte pour atteindre 500 bus à terme.\nLe réseau a été restructuré après 9 ans de crise du transport urbain dans l'agglomération du fait d'une mauvaise gestion, d'abord par Staréo, une filiale de Véolia, puis directement par le groupement public Al Assima regroupant les villes de Rabat, Salé et Témara.\nLe prix d’un ticket comprenant un voyage est fixé à 5 dirhams. Il existe un ticket Tram-Bus, qui permet l’intermodalité entre les deux moyens de transport et valable pour deux voyages, le premier dans le bus et le deuxième dans le tram, voir maximum trois avec correspondance sur la deuxième ligne du tramway. Ce ticket intermodal n'est pour le moment n’est valable que sur la ligne 30 du bus.\nIl existe aussi une navette vers l’aéroport, reliant la gare de Rabat-Agdal à l'aéroport de Rabat-Salé au tarif de 25 dirhams.\n\nTrains\nLa ville de Rabat dispose de deux gares, à savoir : \n\nla Gare de Rabat-Agdal. Depuis sa construction en 1925, le nombre de voyageurs empruntant cette gare n’a cessé d’augmenter. La gare a été rénovée une première fois en 2004, et elle a connu un important réaménagement en 2018 pour devenir la plus grande gare ferroviaire d’Afrique et pour accueillir le train à grande vitesse marocain Al Boraq ;\nla Gare de Rabat-Ville, qui a été rénovée de 2008 à 2010. Elle est en cours[Quand ?] de réaménagement, pour être transformée en musée.\nCes deux gares sont desservies par les trains Al Atlas, pour les connecter à plusieurs villes importantes du royaume comme Tanger, Marrakech, Fès, ou encore Casablanca. Elles sont aussi desservies par le Train Navette Rapide qui les connecte à deux pôles industriels, Casablanca (via la gare de Casa-Port) et Kénitra, en plus de petites villes comme Témara, Skhirat et Bouznika.\nLa gare de Rabat-Agdal est également desservie par Al Boraq, le train à grande vitesse (TGV) qui relie Tanger à Casablanca en passant par Rabat et Kénitra.\nUne gare TGV est prévue en périphérie, près de Technopolis, et une gare RER[Quoi ?] est en projet en banlieue, à Tamesna, pour faciliter le déplacement depuis cette zone densément peuplée dont la plupart des habitants sont des employés.\n\nPopulation et société\nDémographie\nEn 2014, selon la dernière étude du HCP[Qui ?], la ville de Rabat compte 577 827 habitants.\nLa croissance de la population a été stimulée tout au long du XXe siècle par la croissance démographique du Maroc et la migration vers les villes. Le choix de Rabat comme capitale politique et administrative en 1912 a entraîné l'arrivée d'une population importante de fonctionnaires. Jusqu'à l'indépendance, c'est Rabat qui a reçu la majorité du flux migratoire. Après l'indépendance, la croissance s'est accentuée avec l'installation de l'élite intellectuelle dans la capitale. Désormais, la population de Rabat ne croît plus et ce sont Salé et Témara qui reçoivent les nouveaux flux migratoires.\n\nLangues\nLe recensement de 2014 indique que l'arabe est utilisé par 98,4 % de la population de Rabat, tandis que le berbère est parlé sous ses différentes formes par 12,2 %.\nPlusieurs formes de la langue arabe coexistent à Rabat. Le rbati, forme la plus anciennement présente dans la ville et fortement minoritaire, se différencie de la koinè urbaine et des parlers hilaliens résultants des mouvements d'exode rural et de la mobilité des populations au sein du Maroc, qui se sont implantés dans la ville principalement pendant la seconde moitié du XXe siècle. D'autres formes de parlers non-hilaliens sont également présentes au sein des populations s'étant établies à Rabat depuis des villes (Salé, Fès, Tétouan, etc.) ou régions (Jbala, Ghomara, etc.) ayant un parler non-hilalien.\n\nLes « anciennes familles » de Rabat\nLes « anciennes familles » de Rabat sont un groupe social à identité propre constitué d'un ensemble des familles ayant habité la ville depuis plusieurs siècles, avant son ouverture aux populations de l'intérieur du Maroc et l'arrivée massive de migrants lié à l'exode rural qui commença au début du XXe siècle.\nElles se caractérisent par leur homogénéité sociale et culturelle, qui résulte d'une histoire commune marquée par une isolation du reste du pays pendant près de trois siècles, ainsi que d'un héritage culturel marqué par la culture arabo-andalouse.\nLesdites familles, qui sont environ quatre cents, sont considérées, jusqu'à nos jours, comme les « familles rbaties de souche ». Elles conservent une certaine influence sur la vie politique et économique de la cité.\n\nEnseignement supérieur et recherche\nRabat est, avec Casablanca, la ville dans laquelle se concentre la majorité des établissements d'enseignement supérieur marocains, malgré les tentatives récentes de décentralisation de l'enseignement supérieur[Quoi ?]. L'université Mohammed V, première université fondée après l'indépendance (1957), a été scindée en 1992 en deux universités : l'université Mohammed V - Agdal et l'université Mohammed V - Souissi. En septembre 2014, ces deux universités ont fusionné pour redonner naissance à l'université Mohammed V de Rabat.\nL'université comprend les deux premiers établissements d'enseignement supérieur du Maroc : la Faculté des lettres et des sciences humaines, fondée en 1917 sous le nom d’Institut des hautes études marocaines, l'Institut scientifique fondé en 1920 sous le nom d’Institut scientifique chérifien, la plus ancienne école d'ingénieurs du Maroc et d'Afrique : l'École Mohammadia d'ingénieurs, fondée en 1959 et située à l'Agdal.[pas clair]\nL'université Mohammed V accueille 87 000 étudiants (chiffres 2019-2020), dont environ 6 500 en 3e cycle. Les filières de formation comprennent le droit, l'économie, la santé, les sciences humaines et sociales, les sciences de l'éducation et l'ingénierie informatique.\nDe nombreux autres établissements d'enseignement supérieur publics sont installés à Rabat, tels l'institut supérieur de l'information et de la communication (ISIC), l'école nationale d'architecture (ENA), l'institut national des postes et télécommunications (INPT), l'institut agronomique et vétérinaire Hassan II (IAV), l'école nationale d'industrie minérale (ENAM), l'institut national de statistique et d'économie appliquée (INSEA), l'académie marocaine des études diplomatiques et l'université internationale de Rabat (UIR).\nÀ côté, existent également des établissements privés comme l'école supérieure de management, d'informatique et de télécommunication (ESMIT), l'institut supérieur du génie appliqué (IGA), l'école marocaine des sciences de l'ingénieur (EMSI), l'institut des hautes études de management (HEM), l'école supérieure des sciences et technologies de l’ingénierie (ESSTI) et la SIST British University. Dans le domaine des sciences humaines, l'institut universitaire pour la recherche scientifique a été dirigé par Abdelkébir Khatibi.\n\nPersonnalités nées à Rabat\nPoliticiens\nScientifiques\nKawtar Hafidi, physicienne marocaine\nHelene Hagan (en), anthropologue américaine\nPierre Audibert, journaliste et mathématicien français\nAbdel El Manira, neuroscientifique maroco-suédois\n\nÉcrivains et philosophes\nArtistes\nSportifs\nAutres personnalités\nSport\nFootball\nLa ville compte aussi le stade national du Maroc : Complexe sportif Moulay Abdellah. Ce dernier fut construit en 1983. Les équipes de football locales sont :\n\nHandball\nLes équipes de handball locales sont :\n\nles AS FAR ;\nle FUS de Rabat ;\nle Stade Marocain.\n\nBasket-ball\nLes équipes de basket-ball locales sont :\n\nle AS FAR ;\nle FUS de Rabat ;\nle Moghreb de Rabat.\n\nVolley-ball\nLes équipes de volley-ball locales sont :\n\nle AS FAR ;\nle FUS de Rabat ;\nle Crédit agricole Rabat.\n\nÉquitation\nRabat dispose d'une quinzaine de clubs équestres dont le plus connu est le club Dar El-salam, à l'est de la capitale[évasif]. Au Royal club équestre de Dar Es Salam, tous les ans, se déroule la Semaine du cheval animée notamment par les championnats marocains. Les championnats les plus appréciés sont ceux de saut d'obstacles.[évasif]\n\nClubs et centres de loisirs\nJumelages\nRabat est jumelée avec :\n\nNotes et références\nNotes\nNotes et références\nVoir aussi\nBibliographie\nCollectif, Villes et tribus du Maroc, tomes III, IV, V et VI consacrés à Rabat et sa région, Paris, Ernest Leroux, 1918-1920\n(ar) Jean-Pierre Malka (préf.

      "summary": "Rabat (en arabe : الرباط, ar-Ribāṭ ; en amazighe : ⵕⵕⴱⴰⵟ, Ṛṛbaṭ ; en arabe marocain : الرّباط, Rbaṭ) est la capitale du royaume du Maroc. La ville est située sur la côte l'Atlantique, au nord-ouest du Maroc, à 40 km au sud de Kénitra, à 240 km au sud-ouest de Tanger et du détroit de Gibraltar et à 87 km au nord-est de Casablanca. Elle est séparée de la ville de Salé par l'embouchure du Bouregreg, ce qui vaut au deux villes le surnom de « villes jumelles ».\nLors du dernier recensement de 2024, sa population était de 977 827 habitants, faisant de Rabat la 7e ville du royaume. Avec sa banlieue, elle forme la deuxième agglomération de ce pays après celle de Casablanca.\nDepuis 2012, un ensemble de sites de Rabat est inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco. La ville a aussi reçu la deuxième place du classement CNN des « Meilleures destinations touristiques de 2013 ». En 2024, la ville de Rabat reçoit à l’unanimité le prix d'honneur à l'occasion du Programme des Nations unies pour les établissements humains (ONU-Habitat) 2024.",

      "content": "## Overview\nRabat (Arabic: الرباط; Berber: ⵕⵕⴱⴰⴹ), literally \"Fortified Place\", is the capital city of Morocco. The city of Rabat is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n## Understand\nRabat is on the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the river Bou Regreg. On the facing shore of the river lies Salé, Rabat's bedroom community. Together with Temara the cities account for a combined metropolitan population of 2.6 million. It is an easy-going city by Moroccan standards.\nRabat visitor information\n\n## By train\nThere are two stations 34.016-6.83671 Rabat Ville in downtown and 34.0021-6.85562 Rabat Agdal 3 km south of it. There are a tram and a taxi station next to Rabat Ville train station.  Visit OCNF website[dead link] for the timetable. (However, people had reported that the website is not accessible outside Morocco)\nRabat is well served by train and you can get frequent connections to most places:\nMarrakesh is a pleasant 4 hr journey\nFez 2½ hr, 115 dirham 2nd class (May 25)\nCasablanca 1 hr, 45 dirham 2nd class (May 25)\nTangier 1 hr 20 min.\nThe Al Boraq high speed train operates hourly between Casablanca (Casa Voyageurs station) and Tangier with stops at Rabat (Rabat Agdal only) and Kenitra.\n\n## By bus\nThere are now official bus routes listed and bus stops have signs showing at least the bus lines that stop there. Costing 5 dirham (Sep 2019), they are a cheap way to get to know the several layers of Rabat. The buses can be of very variable quality, but it could be worth taking the chance given the cost-saving and experience of what many locals with low income experience. Bus #4 goes from Ocean, to Bab El Had to Avenue Fal Oueld Omair (one of the major streets in the Agdal neighborhood) all the way to its terminus in the upscale and calm new development of Hay Riad. If the bus is crowded watch out for pickpockets.\n\n## By plane\n34.051389-6.7513895 Rabat–Salé Airport (RBA  IATA), in the nearby town of Salé. There are flights every day between Rabat and Paris, Brussels and a lot of domestic destinations. However, the most tourist fly into nearby Casablanca and then come into Rabat by train or coach.      (updated Feb 2018)\nGetting there: when exiting the airport, tourists are funnelled towards a group of parked white taxis that quote 100 - 200 dirham or more. This is unnecessarily expensive. Instead wait for a petit taxi to arrive (blue for Rabat, cream coloured for neighbouring Salé.)  One of these will arrive, dropping someone else off for departure. These run on a meter (\"compteur\" in French) and will be nearer 30 dirham for the same journey. Beware, some of the petit taxi will refuse to use meter.\nDirectly outside the exit of the airport, you will also see a bus stop for AE bus, it connects Rabat-Salé Airport (RBA) with Rabat-Ville train station and Rabat-Agdal train station. First bus leave Airport at 07:10, then every 30-45 mins till last bus leave at midnight. First bus leave Gare Agdal at 06:00, then every 30-45 mins till last bus leave at 23:00. Cost 25 Dirham one way per adult (May 25).\nCurrency changing offices at the airport open at 7 am. ATM available in the airport building. Not all bank charge fees for withdrawal on foreign debit/credit card, could try Al Barid Bank's ATM machine. Shops inside the airport and some hotel charge EUR instead MAD.\nThere are telecommunications companies operate in Rabat Airport where you could buy local sim card.\n\n## On foot\nIf you aren't in a hurry, walking around the area of Centre Ville, Agdal, the University, the Medina, the Ocean/River and the monuments is easy and pleasant. The new Corniche on the river, leading to the Oudaias, has been re-done, and there are expected openings of cafes soon. The route cotiere, or coastal road, past the cemetery and the Oudaias has dramatic ocean-side views, especially charming at sunset.\n\n## By tram\nThere are two lines between Rabat and Salé. It costs only 6 dirham (Sep 2019) for one use and it works from 06:00-23:00. There is a tram every 10 min during the week and every 20 min during Sunday. One of the stations (Mohammed V - Gare de Rabat) is located exactly just in front of the downtown train station (Gare de Rabat-Ville). It is a good way of getting around. Maps are available in every station.\n\n## By taxi\nPetit Taxis, all blue in color, mostly Fiat Uno and Renault Dacia. This inexpensive way to get around town usually won't exceed 25/30 dirham, the minimum fare​ is 5/6 dirham. Be sure to check the meter is running to avoid being over charged at the end of the trip, although this is much less of a problem than in other cities. Don't be surprised if the taxi stops to pick someone else up. Also Uber works in Rabat, but it's 20-30% pricier than regular taxis.\nAvoid the Grand Taxis when traveling around Rabat—they are much more expensive and less safe than blue petit taxis.\n\n## By car\nDriving around yourself is not recommended. Insurance rates are high and most drivers will avoid hitting you at all costs; however, Morocco does have the second highest rate of car accidents in the world, and most drivers do not abide by the traffic laws. Driving doesn't necessarily mean you are going to have an accident but Moroccans recommend great caution when driving.\n\n## Historic center\n34.0318-6.835821 Kasbah of the Oudaias. The Kasbah is the oldest part of Rabat. It has narrow streets with cute white and blue houses, the Andalucian Gardens, the Oudaias Museum housed in a 17th century palace, and a great view of the Atlantic Ocean. The district is enclosed by old fortifications, including a large and beautiful 12th-century stone gate. Free entrance.      (updated Feb 2018)\n34.02617-6.836252 Old Medina. A UNESCO World Heritage Site filled with atmospheric narrow streets and a sizeable market. It is less crowded and maze-like than the medinas of Fes and Marrakesh, making it easy to explore.    (updated Nov 2019)\n34.030548-6.8407763 Chouhada Cemetery. Huge and often colorful cemetery by the sea    (updated Nov 2019)\n34.0335-6.83754 The Beach. Rather small and not particularly appealing one. There are a couple of rustic cafes.

(updated Jan 2017)\n\n## Buy\nRue des Consuls an interesting place to wander. This street is so named because foreign diplomats were required to reside here in the seventeenth century until 1912. At that time the main activity of the area was piracy and taking slaves, who were then auctioned. Under a treaty with the Sultan, they were to be redeemed by diplomats from their countries who then had a budget for such purchases. For convenience, these diplomats were thus a few tens of meters from the place of \"negotiation\". This street was already very active one of the few to be paved. Louis Chenier, the father of the poet Andre Chenier was there representing the King of France from 1768 to 1781. Trading in the redemption of captives was his main activity and he excelled so much that even the Sultan, exhausted, sent him back to France by military force.

There are also lots of stalls selling pancakes and pains au chocolat.\n\n## Budget\nMost budget accommodation is found in the Old Medina of Rabat.

(updated Jun 2020)\n\n## Stay safe\nRabat is considered a safe city. Just use some common sense: avoid wearing expensive jewellery or looking flashy, do not flash large quantities of cash, and avoid unfamiliar and deserted areas at night. If you walk in the crowded streets of the Medina or use a bus, keep a hand on your pockets. Women should avoid low-cut tops, midriffs, or shorts to avoid harassment (which almost always consists of comments, but nothing physical) although this is less of a problem than in other cities. Don't feel the need to be polite--no Moroccan woman would put up with behaviour like that.\n\n## Connect\nRabat is served by all of the mobile companies that can be found elsewhere in Morocco: Inwi, Orange, and Maroc Telecom. Mobile phones can be bought in any of these store's stands, and most do not run on calling plans. Rather, recharge cards can be bought in corner stores that contain a number to call. When that number is called, the company adds the price of the card to your account's balance. Alternatively, more than one SIM card can be bought and changed in and out of the phone, if users need more than one phone number.\n\n## Internet\nInternet access is available in cyber cafes around the city (not in residential neighborhoods though). Service is usually around €0.50 per hr.\nYou'll find Wi-Fi access in some places such as Bert's or Megamall food court, usually those labelled a bit \"trendy\".

Most of its influential and wealthy inhabitants moved to Rabat on the other side of the river. There is a bridge, a tram line and a boat (2 dirham) between the two cities.\nSkhirat — a small town 28 km away from Rabat, known for its beaches, the area around Skhirat has begun developing and property and land prices have increased greatly.\nCasablanca — Morocco's largest and wealthiest city, it hosts headquarters and main industrial facilities for the leading Moroccan and international companies based in Morocco, Casablanca is also the most liberal and progressive of Morocco's cities. However, poverty prevalent in slums on the city's outskirts and an extremely important rural exodus has led to high rates of crime, drug use, prostitution and the rise of Islamism. Casablanca is a mixed bag of Moroccan extremes.",
